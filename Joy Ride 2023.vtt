19
00:01:36.705 --> 00:01:38.315

30
00:02:41.683 --> 00:02:43.163
'Cause I'm adopted from China.

31
00:02:43.293 --> 00:02:45.295
That's why I have a birth mom.

32
00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:46.862
I'd be so mad
if my parents gave me up.

Wait. can we say "Asian"
anymore or is that offensive?

72
00:04:40.062 --> 00:04:41.455
We can't say anything anymore.

145
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:27.925
- Oh. Whoa!
- Mmm-hmm.

146
00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:29.318
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

147
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.538
Is this the playground
we went to as kids?

148
00:07:31.668 --> 00:07:33.540
Fuck yeah.
Look. titty sandbox.

149
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.672
This is chaotic.

150
00:07:35.803 --> 00:07:38.414
That's what my art is
all about. Inspiring chaos.

151
00:07:38.545 --> 00:07:41.069

Asian people have to deal with

I hope someone likes it.

155
00:07:45.203 --> 00:07:47.118
I could really use
a commission right now.

156
00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:48.859
If you really need money.
you could pick up
some shifts here.

157
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.208
Your parents need the help.

158
00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:51.601
I'm not tryin'
to be a sell-out.

159
00:07:51.732 --> 00:07:53.777
- I'm a starving artist.
- Mmm.

160
00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:55.562
I could bring one
of my pieces to Beijing.

161
00:07:55.692 --> 00:07:57.302
Lolo. this is such
an important work...

162
00:07:57.433 --> 00:07:59.130
- Work trip. Work trip.
- Right.

163
00:07:59.261 --> 00:08:01.089
- Or... And just hear me out.
- No. No. No "or."

164
00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:04.179
What if it's our first annual
best friends trip? You and me.

165
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:07.399
Romy and Michele.
Bert and Elmo.

166
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.576
- Ernie.
- Oh. my God.
I'm so embarrassed.

167
00:08:09.706 --> 00:08:11.360
I love the idea
of an annual trip

168
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.840
but you're gonna have
to save some money.

169
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.624
- Yeah.
- You're saving money
by living with me.

170
00:08:14.755 --> 00:08:15.973
And I'm so grateful.

171
00:08:16.104 --> 00:08:17.758
And it's been really fun
but I don't know.

172
00:08:17.888 --> 00:08:19.368
like. maybe I don't wanna live
in White Hills my whole life.

173
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.109
Why not? This is home.

174
00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:22.806
Right. but...

175
00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:25.853
Lolo... we told you to stop
bringing your art in here.

176
00:08:25.983 --> 00:08:27.463
I ran out of space at Audrey's.

177
00:08:27.594 --> 00:08:28.943
Put it away.
We have to go get ready.

178
00:08:29.073 --> 00:08:31.075
- Okay. I'm coming.
- We're coming.

179
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.383
- Do you wanna just...

180
00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.558
- Are we gonna leave it here?
Okay. I'm sorry.

181
00:08:35.689 --> 00:08:37.429
I'm not a radiologist
like Arthur.

182
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.605
- Okay.

183
00:08:39.954 --> 00:08:41.129
To Audrey!

184
00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:42.522
- To Audrey. Yes.
- Thanks for coming over.

185
00:08:42.652 --> 00:08:44.262
Oh. So proud of you.

186
00:08:44.393 --> 00:08:45.568
Guys. you didn't have
to throw a whole party.

187
00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:47.222
We're gonna be back in.
like. four days.

188
00:08:47.352 --> 00:08:49.311
We wanted to give you a nice
send-off. It's a big deal.

189
00:08:49.441 --> 00:08:50.747
Going to your birth country.

190
00:08:50.878 --> 00:08:52.227
It's a business trip.

191
00:08:52.357 --> 00:08:53.837
And it's so great
you're taking Lolo with you.

192
00:08:53.968 --> 00:08:55.491
- Anyway. we brought
<i>Hong Dou Bing.</i>
- Oh. yes.

193
00:08:55.622 --> 00:08:57.885
- These are red bean buns.
Ooh.

194
00:08:58.015 --> 00:08:59.539
Red bean.
- Audrey first.

195
00:08:59.669 --> 00:09:01.236
- Thank you so much.
They look so good.
Yes.

196
00:09:01.366 --> 00:09:02.629
You got the blue one.
Those are special.

197
00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:03.891
Will I like these?

198
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:05.893
No. no. Probably not.
to be honest.

199
00:09:06.023 --> 00:09:07.416
- You're basically white.
- That's not true.

200
00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:08.809
You have a throw pillow
that says. "Wine o'clock."

201
00:09:08.939 --> 00:09:10.593
- Rose all day.
- You own a picnic basket.

202
00:09:10.724 --> 00:09:11.855
They're very useful.

203
00:09:11.986 --> 00:09:13.335
Name every character
on <i>Succession.</i>

204
00:09:13.465 --> 00:09:14.902
Logan. Kendall. Shiv. Roman...
Oh. you got me.

205
00:09:15.032 --> 00:09:18.253
So. I thought it would be fun
to look at some photos

206
00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:20.647
of Audrey from the last time
she was in China.

207
00:09:20.777 --> 00:09:22.866
Oh. my gosh. No. The Chens
don't wanna look at that.

208
00:09:22.997 --> 00:09:24.564
- That's for us.
- Yes.

209
00:09:24.694 --> 00:09:26.087
- No. I...

210
00:09:26.217 --> 00:09:28.393
- Oh.
- Oh. honey. look.
this is the first time

211
00:09:28.524 --> 00:09:30.221
- you held her.
Oh. God.

212
00:09:30.352 --> 00:09:31.658
- Oh. my God. I'm gonna cry.
- So am I.

213
00:09:31.788 --> 00:09:33.398
- No. I know. It's cute.
Who's this?

214
00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:34.748
Look at that
head of hair.

215
00:09:34.878 --> 00:09:36.184
Oh. Oh. that's my birth mom.

216
00:09:36.314 --> 00:09:38.447
How have you never
shown me this?

217
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.057
I don't know.
It's not a big deal.

218
00:09:40.188 --> 00:09:41.493
Who was that actor?
Yeah. she...

219
00:09:41.624 --> 00:09:42.973
Your adoption agency's
on the back.

220
00:09:44.148 --> 00:09:45.802
Yeah.

221
00:09:47.064 --> 00:09:48.588
Should we call them
and maybe get

222
00:09:48.718 --> 00:09:50.546
- information on your mom?
- No. I don't wanna do that.

223
00:09:50.677 --> 00:09:52.940
I mean. we used to talk
about it all the time

224
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.681
when we were little. remember?

225
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:56.639
A grand adventure
to find your birth mom?

226
00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.423
No. No. That was
because we were kids.

227
00:09:58.554 --> 00:09:59.860
And we're adults now.
We've moved on.

228
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.862
At least I have. okay?
So let's not do that.

229
00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:03.472
Anyway. why would
I need more parents

230
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.430
when I have the two best
parents in the world?

231
00:10:05.561 --> 00:10:07.519
- Aw. honey.
- Oh. we love you. sweetie.

232
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.956
- You're the best.

233
00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:10.566
Sandwich!

234
00:10:12.655 --> 00:10:13.830
White people.

235
00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:15.571
You know what?
Another toast.

236
00:10:15.702 --> 00:10:18.530
To Audrey. To movin' on
and movin' up.

237
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:20.271
- Moving up.
- To the best daughter

238
00:10:20.402 --> 00:10:22.317
and the best lawyer
you could ever have.

239
00:10:22.447 --> 00:10:25.494
And Lolo's gonna probably
need a lawyer someday.

240
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.539
- Get the bail money ready.

241
00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:31.282
Gonna need a lawyer.

242
00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:39.203
Guess who's goin' back
to the motherland?

243
00:10:39.334 --> 00:10:41.902
So. if you're in Beijing
and you have a juicy pene

244
00:10:42.032 --> 00:10:43.773
or a vagine hit me up.

245
00:10:43.904 --> 00:10:46.080
<i>Audrey. say hi.</i>

246
00:10:46.254 --> 00:10:47.516
-  <i>No. Lolo.
- Audrey. say hi.</i>

247
00:10:52.129 --> 00:10:53.740
Hey. so I kinda
can't stop thinking

248
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.263
about the picture
of your birth mom.

249
00:10:55.393 --> 00:10:57.091
- Oh.
- You sure you don't wanna
look for her?

250
00:10:57.221 --> 00:10:58.745
- Yep.
- It could be something fun
we do together.

251
00:10:58.875 --> 00:11:00.572
Lolo. I just... I'm sorry.

252
00:11:00.703 --> 00:11:02.400
but remember
this is a work trip.

253
00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:04.098
- Work trip. Work trip.
- Thank you.

254
00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:06.274
Deadeye's coming. by the way.

255
00:11:06.404 --> 00:11:09.016
- What?
- Deadeye's coming.

256
00:11:09.146 --> 00:11:11.322
- Deadeye. your cousin?
- She's visiting friends.

257
00:11:11.453 --> 00:11:13.281
And her parents. you know.
just didn't want her to fly
alone. so I'm chaperoning.

258
00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:14.848
A chaperone?
For a grown woman?

259
00:11:14.978 --> 00:11:16.893
Before you say anything.
I know what you're thinking.

260
00:11:17.024 --> 00:11:18.416
- Your hair grew back.
- Not really.

261
00:11:18.547 --> 00:11:19.983
This is why
my part is this way.

262
00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:21.985
Yeah. That was forever ago.
And she's different now.

263
00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:26.381
I promise.
Deadeye has changed.

264
00:11:26.511 --> 00:11:30.341
She's into music. K-pop.
You know BTS. She's full army.

265
00:11:30.472 --> 00:11:31.865
She's super cool now.

266
00:11:31.995 --> 00:11:33.867
The energy has totally shifted.

267
00:11:33.997 --> 00:11:35.520
Okay.
- Yeah. yeah.

268
00:11:35.651 --> 00:11:37.218
- Hey. Audrey.
- Whoa! Hi. Hey.

269
00:11:37.348 --> 00:11:39.220
- Deadeye.
- Hi.

270
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:40.656
- So...

271
00:11:40.787 --> 00:11:42.876
- Oh. good. Hi!
- Yeah.

272
00:11:43.006 --> 00:11:45.443
Um. so you're...
you're flying with us?

273
00:11:45.574 --> 00:11:47.010
- Just flying?
- Yeah. the pleasure's mine.

274
00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:49.056
- Me. too.
-  Yeah. Um...

275
00:11:49.186 --> 00:11:50.448
so. when we get to Beijing.
you're gonna meet up

276
00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:51.623
- with your BTS friends. right?
- Yeah.

277
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:53.016
- Awesome.
- Yes.

278
00:11:53.147 --> 00:11:55.671
@Jinderalla88. @JHopesGirl.
@SugaIsMyDaddy.

279
00:11:55.802 --> 00:11:57.760
Oh. online people?

280
00:11:57.891 --> 00:11:59.109
Yeah. they're my best friends.

281
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.068
I went to @Jinderalla88's
wedding on Zoom.

282
00:12:01.198 --> 00:12:02.199
- Awesome.
- He married a pillow.

283
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:03.418
Okay.

284
00:12:03.548 --> 00:12:04.767
Oh. oh. one second.

285
00:12:04.898 --> 00:12:06.769
Those can't be real people.

286
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.858
She's just coming to hang out
with us. obviously.

287
00:12:08.989 --> 00:12:10.860
- Trust me. Right when we land.
- Lolo...

288
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:13.210
Deadeye is gonna peace out
and it's gonna be you and me.

289
00:12:13.341 --> 00:12:14.734
Do you think I can bring
these lighters onto the plane?

290
00:12:14.864 --> 00:12:15.865
- I really think it's illegal.
- Okay. Yeah.

291
00:12:15.996 --> 00:12:17.040
- Oh. no.
Oh. yeah.

292
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:18.563
- Not again.
- Okay. I was wrong.

293
00:12:18.694 --> 00:12:20.087
- My hair. My hair.
Come on. it'll be fun.

294
00:12:20.217 --> 00:12:20.957
- We should check the other two.
Friends trip!

295
00:12:21.088 --> 00:12:22.480
I'm gonna take these.

296
00:12:22.611 --> 00:12:23.873
We're gonna priority board
and we'll see you at...

297
00:12:24.004 --> 00:12:25.266
- at the gate. okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

298
00:12:25.396 --> 00:12:26.658
You're gonna Venmo me
for those or...

299
00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:28.530
Lolo?
- I'll sneak you some snacks.

300
00:12:48.724 --> 00:12:52.032
I don't think I've ever been
around only Asian people.

301
00:12:52.162 --> 00:12:55.252
I mean. we look like
everyone else for once.

302
00:12:55.383 --> 00:12:56.688
I think we blend right in.

303
00:12:56.819 --> 00:13:00.083
Yeah. But people here
can tell Chinese-Chinese

304
00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:01.650
from American-Chinese.

305
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.130
- What do you mean?
- See?

306
00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.348
Hong Kong-Chinese.

307
00:13:04.479 --> 00:13:06.046
Bluetooth.

308
00:13:06.176 --> 00:13:08.265
- Shanghai-Chinese. Bougie.

309
00:13:08.396 --> 00:13:09.876
- Ooh. Taiwanese.

310
00:13:10.006 --> 00:13:11.616
- Weird. but cute.
Aw.

311
00:13:11.747 --> 00:13:13.357
- What kinda Chinese are they?

312
00:13:13.488 --> 00:13:14.881
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

313
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:16.447
Are you tryin' to get canceled?
Those are Koreans.

314
00:13:16.578 --> 00:13:18.580
- Oh.
- That's Howdy Fun!

315
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.321
- It's a K-pop group!
- Yeah.

316
00:13:20.451 --> 00:13:22.105
they all have the same face.
That's how you can tell.

317
00:13:22.236 --> 00:13:23.672
Mmm.

318
00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.456
I mean. why are they walking
right though security?

319
00:13:25.587 --> 00:13:28.416
- Because it's Howdy Fun!
-  Okay.

320
00:13:31.549 --> 00:13:33.334
So. where...
Where are we goin'?

321
00:13:33.464 --> 00:13:34.596
Um. well.

322
00:13:34.726 --> 00:13:36.859
we are going to visit
my friend. Kat.

323
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.730
on her set of
<i>The Emperor's Daughter.</i>

324
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:40.428
Oh. I love that show.

325
00:13:40.558 --> 00:13:42.212
- Cool. Okay. let's go.
- Oh.

326
00:13:46.521 --> 00:13:48.001
Hey.
I thought you said

327
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:49.524
it was just for the flight.

328
00:13:49.654 --> 00:13:51.134
She's hanging out with us now?

329
00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:52.919
I didn't even ask Kat
if she can come to set with us.

330
00:13:53.049 --> 00:13:54.572
Is Kat gonna make
a big deal out of it?

331
00:13:54.703 --> 00:13:55.922
- No. I mean. just no...
- Fuck her.

332
00:13:56.052 --> 00:13:57.445
Why do you have such
a problem with her?

333
00:13:57.575 --> 00:13:59.621
You know. you both actually
have a lot in common.

334
00:13:59.751 --> 00:14:02.145
I mean. you're both
very sexually...

335
00:14:02.276 --> 00:14:03.581
- Free?
- Yeah.

336
00:14:03.712 --> 00:14:05.235
She blew Nick and Joe Jonas.

337
00:14:05.366 --> 00:14:06.933
Not Kevin? Not impressed.

338
00:14:08.325 --> 00:14:09.674
She has a tattoo
on her vagina.

339
00:14:12.547 --> 00:14:14.070
What?

340
00:14:14.201 --> 00:14:16.072

00:14:29.216 --> 00:14:31.348

357
00:14:52.021 --> 00:14:53.109
I thought about it. I thought
about it really. really hard.

358
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.458
- Yes.

It's just so itchy and tight.

Clarence.

414
00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:34.792

from college.

00:17:34.923 --> 00:17:35.967
- Oh. yeah. yeah.
- Oh.

416
00:17:36.098 --> 00:17:38.187
Hi. We're best friends. actually.

417
00:17:38.318 --> 00:17:39.275
Clarence and I met on the set
of the show.

418
00:17:39.406 --> 00:17:41.321
He plays the military hero.

419
00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:43.758
Oh. we just saw you.
It was
so good. You're really great.

420
00:17:43.888 --> 00:17:45.455
And I play the good girl.

421
00:17:45.586 --> 00:17:48.545
Played the good girl
in my last two dramas too.
It's...

422
00:17:48.676 --> 00:17:49.981
I think it's kinda my brand.

423
00:17:50.112 --> 00:17:51.809
She's
an absolute angel. isn't she?

424
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:57.163
Kat and I thank God every day
for bringing us together.

425
00:17:57.293 --> 00:17:59.252
- Are you two Bible-thumpers?
- What?

426
00:17:59.382 --> 00:18:02.124
Oh. I... I have always
been a woman of God.

427
00:18:02.255 --> 00:18:04.387
I mean. remember that was one
of the first things I told you

428
00:18:04.518 --> 00:18:06.694
when we met. right. Audrey?
That...

429
00:18:06.824 --> 00:18:08.957
I am a good Christian girl

430
00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.480
saving myself for marriage.

431
00:18:10.611 --> 00:18:12.482
- Wait. what?
- Wait. wait. wait. You two...

432
00:18:13.353 --> 00:18:15.137
have never had sex.

433
00:18:15.268 --> 00:18:17.661
Our connection is
based on spiritual.

434
00:18:17.792 --> 00:18:19.272
not physical intimacy.

435
00:18:19.402 --> 00:18:21.230
Did you have
a spiritual connection

436
00:18:21.361 --> 00:18:23.450
when the Jonas Brothers
were Eiffel towering you?

437
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.495
Oh. my God.

438
00:18:27.671 --> 00:18:30.500
Oh. my God. That's so funny.
I love Paris.

439
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:32.111

440
00:18:32.241 --> 00:18:33.503

443
00:18:37.507 --> 00:18:39.030

444
00:18:41.642 --> 00:18:42.904

448
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:53.349
Yes!

449
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.916
Yeah.

450
00:18:55.046 --> 00:18:56.657
- Nice to meet you all.
So good to meet...

451
00:18:56.787 --> 00:18:59.094
Okay.

452
00:18:59.225 --> 00:19:00.356
Go away!

453
00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:07.102
So. has Clarence ever seen
your pussy tat?

454
00:19:10.497 --> 00:19:13.848
I do confess that at one point
I did have a tiny sunflower

455
00:19:13.978 --> 00:19:15.632
on my inner thigh.

456
00:19:15.763 --> 00:19:17.156
"Edgy."

457
00:19:17.286 --> 00:19:19.549
But it doesn't even matter
because. um. it's gone.

458
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.029
Lasers work miracles.

459
00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.249
Okay?  Gone.

460
00:19:23.379 --> 00:19:24.467
- Prove it.
Lolo.

461
00:19:24.598 --> 00:19:27.340
Mmm.
YOLO. Lolo.

462
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.255
You know. I used to be
like you in college

463
00:19:29.385 --> 00:19:30.560
but guess I just
grew out of it.

464
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:33.084
Really? Oh. 'cause
you seem kinda tense

465
00:19:33.215 --> 00:19:35.304
from
all the no-boning.

466
00:19:35.435 --> 00:19:38.481
You sure you're good? You sure
you don't miss it?

467
00:19:38.612 --> 00:19:41.092
No tongue until the wedding
bell's rung. my friend.

468
00:19:41.223 --> 00:19:43.312
Okay. Um. well. we should
get going now. right?

469
00:19:43.443 --> 00:19:46.663
So. um. we have to go to
this place called Radiance.

470
00:19:46.794 --> 00:19:48.970
It's crazy
that a business meeting
is happening at a club.

471
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.278
- But when in Rome.
do what the Romans do.
- Bathe together.

472
00:19:52.408 --> 00:19:53.453
- Huh.
Well. lucky for you.

473
00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:55.498
I wrapped early.
so I can come now.

474
00:19:55.629 --> 00:19:57.326
I mean. you still need
a translator. right?

475
00:19:57.457 --> 00:19:59.198
- Actually Lolo offered...
- Yeah.

476
00:20:10.339 --> 00:20:11.297
What is that?

477
00:20:15.344 --> 00:20:16.519
[IN ENGLISH] Okay.

478
00:20:18.304 --> 00:20:20.131
-  I like her.
- No. you don't.

479
00:20:34.363 --> 00:20:36.322
Okay.

481
00:20:38.106 --> 00:20:39.107
to get him to sign tonight.

482
00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:42.328

00:22:05.933 --> 00:22:07.151
Mmm. mmm.

515
00:22:09.806 --> 00:22:10.981
Swallow it.

516
00:22:25.082 --> 00:22:25.996
Oh.

517
00:22:26.127 --> 00:22:27.084
Let's play!

518
00:22:27.215 --> 00:22:29.609
Oh. is this a drinking game?

519
00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:30.827
What are...
What are the rules?

520
00:22:30.958 --> 00:22:32.176
Oh.
Ah!

521
00:22:35.484 --> 00:22:36.790
- Oh!

522
00:22:42.926 --> 00:22:43.927
Okay.

523
00:22:48.192 --> 00:22:49.803
You ready to lose
to a celebrity?

524
00:22:49.933 --> 00:22:52.545
Oh. I can't wait to slap
the shit outta you.

525
00:22:52.675 --> 00:22:54.373
Mmm.

526
00:22:58.028 --> 00:22:59.421
Oh! Ah!

527
00:22:59.552 --> 00:23:01.597
Oh. okay. Mmm.

528
00:23:01.728 --> 00:23:03.077
- Mmm.

529
00:23:03.207 --> 00:23:04.513
Oh.

530
00:23:06.254 --> 00:23:07.995
Oh!

531
00:23:13.348 --> 00:23:15.350
Audrey...

532
00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:16.786
You and me?
You and me?

533
00:23:16.917 --> 00:23:18.484
- Yeah. Uh...
- Yeah. Let's fucking go!

534
00:23:18.614 --> 00:23:20.660
Yeah. you're evens. okay?
Uh. you got this.

535
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.183
Close this fucking deal.

536
00:23:22.313 --> 00:23:23.880
- That's my bitch!

537
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:32.541
I won? I won! I won. right?

538
00:23:32.672 --> 00:23:33.760
I won!

539
00:23:35.544 --> 00:23:37.328
I won! I won!

540
00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:38.852
Audrey!

541
00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:44.814
Oh. shit.

542
00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:47.077
Audrey! Audrey! Yes!

543
00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:50.254
You just nailed him
like Mike fuckin' Tyson!

544
00:23:50.385 --> 00:23:51.430
I'm so sorry.

545
00:23:57.131 --> 00:23:58.437
Oh. no. you're good.

546
00:23:58.567 --> 00:23:59.525
Did I hit him?
- Yeah. yeah. he's fine.

547
00:23:59.655 --> 00:24:01.309
- Yeah! Yeah!

548
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.528
I'm just gonna... Yeah!

549
00:24:07.837 --> 00:24:09.926
I'm so. so fucked.

550
00:24:10.057 --> 00:24:11.319
No. no. you're good.

551
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.626
Oh. thank God for Kat.
Look at her.

552
00:24:13.756 --> 00:24:16.193
Chunhwa just schmoozing
with those businessmen.

553
00:24:16.324 --> 00:24:17.543
salvaging our night.

554
00:24:17.673 --> 00:24:20.154
God. I love her.

555
00:24:20.284 --> 00:24:22.417
- God. I'm gonna be sick again.
- I'll get you a ginger ale.

556
00:24:22.548 --> 00:24:25.768
Get me a new face or stomach.
or something.

557
00:24:25.899 --> 00:24:27.466
Are you feeling better?
- I'm so sorry.

558
00:24:27.596 --> 00:24:30.294
I... I usually don't. um.
have eggs like that and...

559
00:24:30.425 --> 00:24:31.426
Wait. Uh.

560
00:24:32.209 --> 00:24:33.559
Do you speak English?

561
00:24:33.689 --> 00:24:35.474
Many Chinese people
speak English.

562
00:24:35.604 --> 00:24:38.955
But most Americans
do not speak Chinese.

563
00:24:39.086 --> 00:24:40.914
It's always fun to pretend.

564
00:24:41.044 --> 00:24:43.656
By the way. I appreciate that
you would want to smash this.

565
00:24:43.786 --> 00:24:46.963
Oh.  Well. I would.
I'd smash it really...

566
00:24:47.094 --> 00:24:49.226
I can see it's your first time
in China.

567
00:24:49.357 --> 00:24:50.924
Yeah. You know what? I'm...

568
00:24:51.054 --> 00:24:53.100
I'm usually not like this.
I'm... I'm so sorry. I got sick.

569
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.842
But I'm... I'm very ready
to go over the terms

570
00:24:55.972 --> 00:24:57.191
of our business proposal.

571
00:24:57.321 --> 00:24:58.932
You know.
there's a saying in Chinese.

572
00:25:04.764 --> 00:25:06.592
It means.
you can tell a lot
about a person

573
00:25:06.722 --> 00:25:07.854
by their family.

574
00:25:07.984 --> 00:25:09.856
Do you have any relatives
in China?

575
00:25:09.986 --> 00:25:11.422
Oh. uh. yeah. well. probably.

576
00:25:11.553 --> 00:25:14.513
Uh. sure. yes.
Definitely. probably.

577
00:25:14.643 --> 00:25:16.340
Um. I... I was adopted. so...

578
00:25:16.471 --> 00:25:19.169
Oh. well. if you do not know
where you come from.

579
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.736
how do you know who you are?

580
00:25:20.867 --> 00:25:23.086
Oh. God.  No. no.
I know where I'm from.

581
00:25:23.217 --> 00:25:25.088
Actually. you know. I was
born here. but I am American.

582
00:25:25.219 --> 00:25:27.134
So. you have no contact
with your Chinese family.

583
00:25:27.264 --> 00:25:29.571
That's a shame.

584
00:25:32.095 --> 00:25:34.663
Uh...
What? What'd he say?

585
00:25:34.794 --> 00:25:38.275
Well. she's actually really
close with her birth mother.

586
00:25:40.887 --> 00:25:42.889
- Yeah. Like that.
Oh.

587
00:25:43.019 --> 00:25:44.760
-  Really?
- Yeah. yeah.

588
00:25:44.891 --> 00:25:45.892
We're actually meeting up
with her this week.

589
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:48.329
My mother is celebrating

590
00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:49.809
her 70th birthday this Friday.

591
00:25:49.939 --> 00:25:51.637
- Oh. wow.
- It's gonna be a big event.

592
00:25:51.767 --> 00:25:53.726
Her favorite performer's
gonna be there. DJ Tiesto.

593
00:25:53.856 --> 00:25:56.598
We're gonna have gift bags.
oranges. Teslas.

594
00:25:56.729 --> 00:25:58.513
Bitcoin. that kinda thing.

595
00:25:58.644 --> 00:26:01.255
I would love for you to come.
Bring your mother.

596
00:26:01.385 --> 00:26:03.257
My mother? Um. no... Oh...

597
00:26:03.387 --> 00:26:05.172
Oh. you know what.
uh. we couldn't impose.

598
00:26:05.302 --> 00:26:07.870
- No. no. I insist.
- You insist. He insists.

599
00:26:08.001 --> 00:26:10.177
- Oh. yeah. This one.
- How are we supposed
to do business together

600
00:26:10.307 --> 00:26:11.961
if we do not know
each other's families?

601
00:26:12.092 --> 00:26:13.484
We can't do business
if we don't...

602
00:26:13.615 --> 00:26:15.748
Come to the event.
and we'll close the deal there.

603
00:26:15.878 --> 00:26:17.924
- Oh. yeah.

604
00:26:21.231 --> 00:26:22.842
Oh. Finally.

605
00:26:22.972 --> 00:26:24.452
We'll be there.
It's... It's a mom party.

606
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:26.672
So. it's settled then.

607
00:26:26.802 --> 00:26:29.196
I... Just give me a minute.

608
00:26:30.632 --> 00:26:31.938
Hell yeah.
I'm not okay.

609
00:26:32.068 --> 00:26:33.548
I can't feel my face.

610
00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:35.550
Oh. fuck.

611
00:26:35.681 --> 00:26:37.770
Fuck. That went
so fucking terribly.

612
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.728
Not to me. Uh. I feel closer
to you than ever.

613
00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:41.382
- Oh. my God.
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

614
00:26:41.512 --> 00:26:43.340
Uh. no. no. no. I'm good.
I'm good. Deadeye. I'm so...

615
00:26:43.471 --> 00:26:45.734
I'm so sorry again that
I threw up on you. We got...

616
00:26:45.865 --> 00:26:46.953
We better clean you up.

617
00:26:47.083 --> 00:26:48.432
Okay. I... I'll find something.

618
00:26:50.739 --> 00:26:52.436
See. I knew
this was gonna happen

619
00:26:52.567 --> 00:26:53.960
if I brought you on
this business trip. Lolo.

620
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.265
You're always doing
shit like this.

621
00:26:55.396 --> 00:26:57.050
What about a "thank you?"

622
00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.008
I mean. you were
sinking in there.
and I saved your ass.

623
00:26:59.139 --> 00:27:00.662
Well. whatever you were doing.
you failed.

624
00:27:00.793 --> 00:27:02.359
This is my job.

625
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.187
Why would you lie and tell
Chao that I knew my birth mom?

626
00:27:04.318 --> 00:27:05.841
- That's insane.
- That is insane.

627
00:27:05.972 --> 00:27:08.322
Are you her echo? Who the fuck
asked for your opinion?

628
00:27:08.452 --> 00:27:09.845
Well. what do you expect
her to do now?

629
00:27:09.976 --> 00:27:11.891
She could go find
her birth mom.

630
00:27:12.021 --> 00:27:12.979
Just like we always said
we would.

631
00:27:13.109 --> 00:27:14.154
That was hypothetical.

632
00:27:14.284 --> 00:27:15.546
We don't even know
where she is.

633
00:27:15.677 --> 00:27:16.852
What. you want me to search
all of China?

634
00:27:16.983 --> 00:27:18.114
Give it to me!

635
00:27:19.855 --> 00:27:21.683
- Great.
- So. the other day.

636
00:27:21.814 --> 00:27:23.642
I may have called
the adoption agency

637
00:27:23.772 --> 00:27:24.947
and pretended to be you.

638
00:27:25.078 --> 00:27:26.819
- What are you talking about?
Wow!

639
00:27:26.949 --> 00:27:28.385
Apparently.
at the time of adoption

640
00:27:28.516 --> 00:27:29.909
she agreed to be contacted.

641
00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:31.040
She's open to meeting you.

642
00:27:32.346 --> 00:27:34.348
Her address is on there.
She lives in Haiching.

643
00:27:34.478 --> 00:27:35.697
which is super close
to Nai Nai's.

644
00:27:35.828 --> 00:27:37.264
And we'll just stay with them.

645
00:27:37.394 --> 00:27:39.658
Oh. no. no. no.
She can't handle it!

646
00:27:39.788 --> 00:27:41.094
Wait. no. Why not?
I can handle it.

647
00:27:41.224 --> 00:27:43.096
Nai Nai's like.
Chinese-Chinese.

648
00:27:43.226 --> 00:27:45.272
Like. "super long hair
coming out of a mole

649
00:27:45.402 --> 00:27:47.317
"and refuses to pluck it
'cause it's bad luck" Chinese.

650
00:27:47.448 --> 00:27:48.884
"Forces you to overeat.

651
00:27:49.015 --> 00:27:50.669
"and then comments
on your weight later" Chinese.

652
00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:52.671
Like. literally.
"take her bra off.
wipe her under-boob sweat

653
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:53.889
"in the middle of
a Buddhist temple

654
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.543
"and make you sniff it" Chinese.

655
00:27:55.674 --> 00:27:57.458
"Has a plastic bag full of
other plastic bags" Chinese.

656
00:27:57.588 --> 00:27:59.068
Don't act like
you know my family.

657
00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:01.027
You don't know
what we've been through.
Look at Deadeye!

658
00:28:01.157 --> 00:28:03.203
Look at me! Look at me!

659
00:28:03.333 --> 00:28:05.596
It'll be fine.
We'll take the train and...

660
00:28:05.727 --> 00:28:07.294
And go straight to Haiching

661
00:28:07.424 --> 00:28:08.382
and we'll be there
tomorrow afternoon.

662
00:28:08.512 --> 00:28:09.905
And I'm gonna close this deal.

663
00:28:10.036 --> 00:28:11.777
And it'd be really nice
to meet your birth mother.

664
00:28:13.256 --> 00:28:14.780
Okay.

665
00:28:16.259 --> 00:28:17.304
Okay. will you guys
come with me?

666
00:28:17.434 --> 00:28:18.871
Fuck yes. bitch.

667
00:28:19.001 --> 00:28:20.699
- I'm here for you. Audrey.
- Oh. my God. thank you.

668
00:28:20.829 --> 00:28:22.570
Really?
- I love a grand adventure.

669
00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:24.746
- Thank you. Thank you. Okay.

670
00:28:24.877 --> 00:28:26.356
Okay. so were gonna go
to Haiching.

671
00:28:26.487 --> 00:28:27.357
Okay. all right. Yeah.
we're doin' it. We're doin' it.

672
00:28:27.488 --> 00:28:28.445
- Haiching. baby!
- Yes!

673
00:28:30.273 --> 00:28:32.145
Guys. guys. I'm a boy.

674
00:28:42.068 --> 00:28:43.199
Just so you guys know.

675
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.202
I have extra cash
in my money belt.

676
00:28:46.333 --> 00:28:47.682
And also. our passports
are in there too.

677
00:28:47.813 --> 00:28:49.553
- Why are you being paranoid?
Don't worry.

678
00:28:49.684 --> 00:28:51.773
I've got locks on my bag.
Just put it in here.

679
00:28:51.904 --> 00:28:53.514
- Really?
- Of course.

680
00:28:53.644 --> 00:28:54.733
Okay. Make sure your
bags are zipped at all times.

681
00:28:54.863 --> 00:28:56.386
See? Zip it. Zip it. Zip it.

682
00:28:56.517 --> 00:28:58.301
We're in China.
It's the safest place
in the world.

683
00:28:58.432 --> 00:28:59.912
I heard that if you're short.

684
00:29:00.042 --> 00:29:01.478
you'll get kidnapped to go
live on a gymnastics farm.

685
00:29:01.609 --> 00:29:03.002
That's not a thing.

686
00:29:03.132 --> 00:29:04.394
All I'm saying is
that as foreigners.

687
00:29:04.525 --> 00:29:06.092
we need to be extra vigilant. okay?

688
00:29:06.222 --> 00:29:07.789
Just keep our heads on
a swivel. And watch what

689
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.399
- we eat and what we drink.
- Ooh. good call.

690
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.401
- Let's get some snacks.
- Nom. nom. nom.

691
00:29:11.532 --> 00:29:13.012
- Squid on a stick.
- Okay.

692
00:29:13.142 --> 00:29:14.578
Just come back here. okay?

693
00:29:14.709 --> 00:29:16.102
- We have eight minutes.
Okay. guess what?

694
00:29:16.232 --> 00:29:18.452
Remember when I told you
I auditioned for that movie?

695
00:29:18.582 --> 00:29:19.670
<i>Sweet Home Orange County?</i>

696
00:29:19.801 --> 00:29:21.542
- Well. I got the part.
- You what?

697
00:29:21.672 --> 00:29:23.413
I'm gonna be in LA next summer.

698
00:29:23.544 --> 00:29:24.937
Oh. congratulations.

699
00:29:25.067 --> 00:29:26.286
Isn't there a chance
you're gonna be in LA too?

700
00:29:26.416 --> 00:29:27.417
Yeah.

701
00:29:27.548 --> 00:29:29.376
- Hotties in La La Land!
- See.

702
00:29:29.506 --> 00:29:31.247
this is why I have to close
this deal and make partner.

703
00:29:31.378 --> 00:29:32.683
It's gonna be so amazing

704
00:29:32.814 --> 00:29:34.511
to have a friend there.
I mean. you really...

705
00:29:34.642 --> 00:29:35.730
You really know me.

706
00:29:35.861 --> 00:29:37.036
- Yeah. I know.
- You've seen a lot.

707
00:29:37.166 --> 00:29:38.124
I've seen a little too much.

708
00:29:42.998 --> 00:29:45.174
Do you think it's okay that
I haven't told Clarence

709
00:29:45.305 --> 00:29:46.436
everything about
my past and...

710
00:29:46.567 --> 00:29:48.874
Yeah. no. it's totally okay.

711
00:29:49.004 --> 00:29:50.527
I mean. hey. can you...

712
00:29:50.658 --> 00:29:51.877
- Okay.
- ...not mention LA to Lolo?

713
00:29:52.007 --> 00:29:53.313
I haven't really told her
about it yet.

714
00:29:53.443 --> 00:29:54.923
Is there an issue there?

715
00:29:55.054 --> 00:29:56.664
Yeah. no. I mean.
I'll tell her eventually.

716
00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:59.362
But. uh. you know. she doesn't
have as much going on as I do.

717
00:30:01.974 --> 00:30:02.931
And I.
I just think it might be

718
00:30:03.062 --> 00:30:04.454
great to have some space.

719
00:30:04.585 --> 00:30:06.456
I get it.

720
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:08.502
It's between you and me.

721
00:30:08.632 --> 00:30:10.330
- Thank you. Zip.
- Zip.

722
00:30:11.287 --> 00:30:12.332
Where do we sit?

723
00:30:12.462 --> 00:30:14.160
Find any car
with open seats.

724
00:30:17.903 --> 00:30:19.600
Those guys look shady.

725
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.210
Oh. there's room here.
- I'm not really...

726
00:30:21.341 --> 00:30:22.733
We'd have to squeeze.

727
00:30:22.864 --> 00:30:24.518
I hate the smell of oranges.

728
00:30:26.563 --> 00:30:28.957
Oh. hi. um. is anyone else
sitting here with you?

729
00:30:30.698 --> 00:30:33.135
No. Sorry. No.
They're not sitting here.

730
00:30:33.266 --> 00:30:34.528
Oh. amazing. Hey. guys!

731
00:30:34.658 --> 00:30:36.443
Guys. guys. come on.
I found one.

732
00:30:37.748 --> 00:30:40.229
It's so nice
to see an American.

733
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.578
Where are you visiting from?

734
00:30:41.709 --> 00:30:43.885
Oh. um.
I actually live in Beijing.

735
00:30:44.016 --> 00:30:45.495
No way. She lives here.

736
00:30:45.626 --> 00:30:46.801
Yeah.
I moved here. like.

737
00:30:46.932 --> 00:30:47.889
I wanna say. five years ago.
I love it.

738
00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.022
Also. looking like me here

739
00:30:50.152 --> 00:30:51.893
- I get so much attention.
- Totally.

740
00:30:52.024 --> 00:30:53.155
Asian people with me.

741
00:30:53.286 --> 00:30:54.765
it's just... They've...
I... I'm Gisele.

742
00:30:54.896 --> 00:30:56.028
Yeah.
So. you like living here?

743
00:30:56.158 --> 00:30:57.812
I love it.
The people are great.

744
00:30:57.943 --> 00:30:59.335
the food's incredible.
And it's safe.

745
00:30:59.466 --> 00:31:02.208
Is it safe?
Because. I... I mean.

746
00:31:02.338 --> 00:31:04.210
I just. I hear there's a lot
of pickpockets here. right?

747
00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.865
And Chinese youths
are getting really into drugs.

748
00:31:06.995 --> 00:31:08.388
Fuck yeah. they are.

749
00:31:08.518 --> 00:31:09.824
Chinese kids
are cool as fuck.

750
00:31:09.955 --> 00:31:11.304
They fucking party.

751
00:31:11.434 --> 00:31:12.609
You can get anything
you want here.

752
00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.090
I... It's...
It's so unbelievable.

753
00:31:15.221 --> 00:31:16.439
I mean. anything you want.

754
00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.963
China White. benzos.
bush. kush.

755
00:31:18.093 --> 00:31:19.529
Uh. just curious.
what do you do for work?

756
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:20.617
- Hmm?
- Mmm?

757
00:31:20.748 --> 00:31:22.576
Oh. I do import. I do import

758
00:31:22.706 --> 00:31:24.621
- and then I... I also do export.
- That's so cool.

759
00:31:24.752 --> 00:31:26.101
So like. like furniture?

760
00:31:26.232 --> 00:31:27.711
Sure.

761
00:31:27.842 --> 00:31:30.062
I have my period.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

762
00:31:30.192 --> 00:31:32.368
Oh. shit.
I'm bleeding.

763
00:31:33.674 --> 00:31:35.067
Fuck.

764
00:31:35.197 --> 00:31:36.938
- Oh. my God. She's so sweet!
- Are you serious?

765
00:31:37.069 --> 00:31:39.027
- That bitch is so suspicious.
- What are you talking about?

766
00:31:39.158 --> 00:31:41.464
- She's super nice.
- Okay. I know you chose her

767
00:31:41.595 --> 00:31:44.337
because she's American
varsity blue corn-fed bitch.

768
00:31:44.467 --> 00:31:45.686
but. like. no!

769
00:31:45.816 --> 00:31:47.340
No. she's totally sus!
There's something

770
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.907
- wrong with her.
- Yeah. you're not my favorite.

771
00:31:49.037 --> 00:31:50.212
- but I do agree.
Shit! Fuck!

772
00:31:50.343 --> 00:31:51.561
- Hey. are you...
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

773
00:31:51.692 --> 00:31:52.649
Are you okay?

774
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.955
Pox is gonna kill me.

775
00:31:54.086 --> 00:31:55.609
- I know it's hot in here.
Fuck!

776
00:31:55.739 --> 00:31:56.871
- You can't open that window.
- What are you looking at?

777
00:31:57.002 --> 00:31:58.394
There's nothing
to fucking see here.

778
00:31:58.525 --> 00:31:59.961
Don't look at me like that.

779
00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:01.441
- What is that?

780
00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:07.534
It's the cops.
They're doing a bag check.

781
00:32:07.664 --> 00:32:09.057
Um. yeah. there's a drug
dealer on the train.

782
00:32:09.188 --> 00:32:11.364
- Oh. fuck!
- Who do we think it is?

783
00:32:11.494 --> 00:32:12.843
The family with the oranges?

784
00:32:12.974 --> 00:32:15.890
Audrey. get a fucking grip!
It's this bitch.

785
00:32:16.021 --> 00:32:17.413
Oh. my God!
You're a drug dealer?

786
00:32:17.544 --> 00:32:19.111
Of course. I am. I was trying
to sell you drugs.

787
00:32:19.241 --> 00:32:20.329
Okay. you need
to get rid of that now.

788
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.983
Get rid of it.

789
00:32:22.114 --> 00:32:23.506
We need to get rid of that.
'Cause if I'm going down.

790
00:32:23.637 --> 00:32:25.247
you little dipshits
are going down with me.

791
00:32:25.378 --> 00:32:26.901
We're American. They're gonna
come after all of us.

792
00:32:27.032 --> 00:32:28.816
If the cops ask. we'll just
say we have nothing to do

793
00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:29.948
- with her.

794
00:32:31.427 --> 00:32:33.038
You're drug dealers now.
bitches!

795
00:32:33.168 --> 00:32:34.256
What the fuck?

796
00:32:34.387 --> 00:32:36.041
Okay. that is good shit.
by the way.

797
00:32:36.171 --> 00:32:37.390
Yeah. I only sell the best.

798
00:32:38.826 --> 00:32:40.132
Oh. fuck. Fuck.

799
00:32:40.262 --> 00:32:41.481
No. no. no.
- Oh. shit.

800
00:32:41.611 --> 00:32:43.091
We can't get caught
with drugs in China.

801
00:32:43.222 --> 00:32:44.919
We'll get deported.
Or jail. probably for life.

802
00:32:45.093 --> 00:32:46.573
Oh. my God. is this what
happened in <i>Brokedown Palace?</i>

803
00:32:46.703 --> 00:32:47.835
That was Thailand!

804
00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:48.923
Oh. my God.
I'm gonna get disbarred.

805
00:32:49.054 --> 00:32:50.533
I am too famous for jail.

806
00:32:50.664 --> 00:32:51.970
You guys need to
calm the fuck down

807
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.101
and you need to fuckin'
listen to me. okay?

808
00:32:53.232 --> 00:32:54.668
Since that window's
not working.

809
00:32:54.798 --> 00:32:56.017
we have two options.
We hide the drugs in our body.

810
00:32:56.148 --> 00:32:57.845
or we do them. okay?
I need your help.

811
00:32:57.976 --> 00:32:59.064
You look like you've done
a lot of drugs.

812
00:32:59.194 --> 00:33:00.282
- That's correct.
- You look like you've

813
00:33:00.413 --> 00:33:01.544
had a lot of things
in your asshole.

814
00:33:01.675 --> 00:33:03.068
Uh. not a lot of things.
Just one thing.

815
00:33:03.198 --> 00:33:04.460
But maybe different varieties
of that one thing.

816
00:33:04.591 --> 00:33:07.246
um. which is dick. I mean.
no. no!

817
00:33:07.376 --> 00:33:08.769
You don't understand.
Cocaine makes me really horny.

818
00:33:08.899 --> 00:33:10.336
- It could get really weird.
- I know you two aren't

819
00:33:10.466 --> 00:33:12.425
drug people and I know
you're super scared right now

820
00:33:12.555 --> 00:33:14.035
but you're gonna
need to decide.

821
00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:15.384
Are you gonna step up
for your fellow countrywoman?

822
00:33:15.515 --> 00:33:17.038
You gonna plug
or you gonna play?

823
00:33:17.169 --> 00:33:18.344
No. Neither.

824
00:33:18.474 --> 00:33:20.563
- Is that a condom?

825
00:33:20.694 --> 00:33:23.392
I'm not ready to have sex!

826
00:33:29.268 --> 00:33:31.270
- Fuck! Group project!

827
00:33:39.713 --> 00:33:40.757
Deadeye. get in there.

828
00:33:53.553 --> 00:33:54.945
You know what.
I'll handle this. okay?

829
00:33:55.076 --> 00:33:56.425
I got it. I got it. guys.
I got it. got it.

830
00:33:56.556 --> 00:33:58.123
Attention. Chinese policemen.

831
00:33:58.253 --> 00:33:59.994
Oh. shit.
You're about to get lawyered.

832
00:34:00.125 --> 00:34:01.735
Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi.

833
00:34:01.865 --> 00:34:03.258
I know that you think
that we have drugs.

834
00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:06.218
and we do not have drugs.
In fact. I'm a lawyer.

835
00:34:06.348 --> 00:34:09.221
I'm a lawyer. I'm in fact.
a very good lawyer.

836
00:34:09.351 --> 00:34:10.483
And so I just
want you to know that

837
00:34:10.613 --> 00:34:12.746
we are citizens of Amer... America.

838
00:34:12.876 --> 00:34:14.356
And that is why
I rest my case.

839
00:34:14.487 --> 00:34:16.489
- Bonk! Bonk!
- Mmm.

840
00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.764
- Mmm-mmm.
-  Okay?

841
00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:32.940
And she took my suitcase.
She took my suitcase.

842
00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:35.986
Hey! This is mine!

843
00:34:37.466 --> 00:34:38.554
Are you kidding? This is mine.

844
00:34:38.685 --> 00:34:40.774
I've never done
drugs in my life.

845
00:34:47.041 --> 00:34:48.260
Okay. okay. We're good.

846
00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:49.870
we're good. we're good.
we're good. Okay.

847
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.219
Every... Everybody. calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

848
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:52.829
Oh. my God! What the fuck?

849
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.657
That American girl stole
Kat's suitcase.

850
00:34:54.788 --> 00:34:56.529
Our passports are in there.

851
00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:58.313
Well. the bright side is.
we just got
kicked off the train.

852
00:34:58.444 --> 00:35:00.359
We're not hanging by our
nipples in a meat freezer.

853
00:35:00.489 --> 00:35:02.056
No. no. no. no. If we do not
have our passports.

854
00:35:02.187 --> 00:35:04.102
then we can't go home.
And if we can't go home.

855
00:35:04.232 --> 00:35:05.799
then we can't go to our jobs.
And if we don't have jobs.

856
00:35:05.929 --> 00:35:07.496
we can't get more money
to get more coke.

857
00:35:07.627 --> 00:35:09.890
I want more coke. Oh. my God.
Is anyone else itchy?

858
00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.370
I'm sorry. I'm just.
I'm fucking itchy.

859
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.111
Fuck. Fuck.
Kat. honey. you good?

860
00:35:13.241 --> 00:35:14.634
- Are they coming out?
- Yeah. but only seven.

861
00:35:14.764 --> 00:35:16.766
- And I think I put in eight.
- If you get a clean one

862
00:35:16.897 --> 00:35:18.159
could you just. um.
keep me posted?

863
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.379
I hate you so much right now!

864
00:35:20.509 --> 00:35:22.511
Just push. Pull.
I mean. twist it.

865
00:35:22.642 --> 00:35:24.513
It's not a Bop It.
it's my asshole!

866
00:35:24.644 --> 00:35:26.254
Okay. just stick
your hand up there

867
00:35:26.385 --> 00:35:28.909
like a claw machine tryin'
to get the stuffed bear.

868
00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:31.085
- Okay.
- Deeper!

869
00:35:31.216 --> 00:35:32.478
Okay.
- Higher!

870
00:35:32.608 --> 00:35:34.262
- Okay!
- Get that bear!

871
00:35:34.393 --> 00:35:35.959
I'm getting the bear!

872
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.874
- How are you so normal?

873
00:35:38.005 --> 00:35:40.050
You did. like. twice as much
stuff as the rest of us.

874
00:35:40.181 --> 00:35:42.444
I think all the coke and molly
just balanced out my system.

875
00:35:42.575 --> 00:35:44.011
I just feel good.

876
00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:45.273
Like. "just watched a child

877
00:35:45.404 --> 00:35:46.840
"fall through
a manhole cover" good.

878
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.321
You deserve it.
little shit.

879
00:35:49.451 --> 00:35:51.410
You're a beautiful
silk kimono.

880
00:35:54.456 --> 00:35:56.154
Is this a hot dog on a stick?

881
00:35:56.284 --> 00:35:57.938
You know what?
Maybe I just miscounted.

882
00:35:58.068 --> 00:35:59.069
It's probably seven.

883
00:36:09.776 --> 00:36:13.171
Deadeye! If you find coke.
come back!

884
00:36:13.301 --> 00:36:15.390
Guys. how have
we walked for hours

885
00:36:15.521 --> 00:36:17.000
and haven't seen one car?

886
00:36:17.131 --> 00:36:19.264
It's all good.
I DM'd Baron Davis.

887
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:24.617
Fuck. The next town
is 27 kilometers away.

888
00:36:24.747 --> 00:36:26.662
My basketball boo
is on his way. okay?

889
00:36:26.793 --> 00:36:28.316
Oh. Although. at this point.

890
00:36:28.447 --> 00:36:30.144
I don't even wanna be
rescued. okay?

891
00:36:30.275 --> 00:36:31.841
I cannot be seen in public

892
00:36:31.972 --> 00:36:33.060
- looking like this.

893
00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:34.279
Yeah. you look like
Hello Kitty

894
00:36:34.409 --> 00:36:35.845
just got skull-fucked
by Grobie.

895
00:36:35.976 --> 00:36:39.501
Oh. my God.
you're so funny!

896
00:36:39.632 --> 00:36:40.807
- Fuck you!

897
00:36:40.937 --> 00:36:42.765
This is all your fault.

898
00:36:42.896 --> 00:36:44.419
How is it my fault?

899
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.639
I'm not the one who
chose the train cabin

900
00:36:46.769 --> 00:36:48.554
with the one
obvious drug dealer

901
00:36:48.684 --> 00:36:51.600
just 'cause I'm a wee bit
racist against my own people.

902
00:36:51.731 --> 00:36:53.994
- I'm not racist.
- Hey. "not racist."

903
00:36:54.124 --> 00:36:55.387
But you don't like boba

904
00:36:55.517 --> 00:36:57.215
and you've never fucked
an Asian guy. so...

905
00:36:57.345 --> 00:36:59.565
- Damn. Still?
- No. no. Remember that

906
00:36:59.695 --> 00:37:02.002
foreign exchange student
from Kazakhstan?

907
00:37:02.132 --> 00:37:03.525
B... Bizi... Bizip? Uh. Bazid?

908
00:37:03.656 --> 00:37:05.527
- David?
- David. David.

909
00:37:05.658 --> 00:37:06.746
Is Kazakhstan even in Asia?

910
00:37:06.876 --> 00:37:08.138
They look kind of
Asian sometimes.

911
00:37:08.269 --> 00:37:10.445
Oh. my God!
- Okay. Racist.

912
00:37:10.576 --> 00:37:12.708
When I masturbate. I sometimes
fantasize about Splinter.

913
00:37:12.839 --> 00:37:13.883
- He's Asian.
- He's a rat.

914
00:37:14.014 --> 00:37:15.711
He's a good father.

915
00:37:15.842 --> 00:37:18.410
Fine. Fine. I'm sorry. okay?
It's my fault.

916
00:37:19.933 --> 00:37:21.064
Oh. my God.

917
00:37:21.195 --> 00:37:22.544
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

918
00:37:23.676 --> 00:37:24.720
My phone is dead.

919
00:37:24.851 --> 00:37:26.374
We don't have
any food or water.

920
00:37:26.505 --> 00:37:28.681
God. I should have
never come to China.

921
00:37:28.811 --> 00:37:30.117
Wait. there's someone
on the road.

922
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:31.988
No. there isn't.
You're probably hallucinating.

923
00:37:32.119 --> 00:37:33.990
Okay. maybe because
I also see a giraffe

924
00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:35.253
peeling off his spots

925
00:37:35.383 --> 00:37:36.602
and throwing them
like a frisbee.

926
00:37:36.732 --> 00:37:37.690
Oh. shit!

927
00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.257
Jeez.

928
00:37:39.387 --> 00:37:40.649
Okay. but that's a bus. right?

929
00:37:51.573 --> 00:37:52.574
Baron.

930
00:37:52.705 --> 00:37:54.315
I knew you would come for me.

931
00:37:54.446 --> 00:37:55.708
<i>Ni hao.</i> Lolo.

932
00:37:56.622 --> 00:37:58.145
I heard y'all needed a ride.

933
00:38:10.375 --> 00:38:12.028
Okay. so the team is going
to give us a ride to Haiching

934
00:38:12.159 --> 00:38:13.247
first thing in the morning.

935
00:38:13.378 --> 00:38:15.118
- And then we can...
Ooh. ooh.

936
00:38:15.249 --> 00:38:16.468
Oh.

937
00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:28.871
Audrey. are you eye-fucking
an Asian guy?

938
00:38:29.002 --> 00:38:31.091
No. No. no. Don't. No. Lolo.
don't get us in trouble.

939
00:38:31.221 --> 00:38:32.440
We're just. you know. just.

940
00:38:32.571 --> 00:38:34.094
they're our ride.
so let's just be cool.

941
00:38:34.224 --> 00:38:36.879
- Let's be cool.
- I'm cool. I'm very cool.

942
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:39.317
I'm gonna <i>Jaws</i> the fuck
outta Baron Davis tonight.

943
00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.275
Aah. Aah.

944
00:38:41.406 --> 00:38:43.103
- Your mouth is so big.
- Oh. my God.

945
00:38:43.233 --> 00:38:45.627
I know.  But. look.
without teeth. not as big.

946
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.413
- Why is mine so tiny?
- I'm all underbite.

947
00:38:48.543 --> 00:38:50.502
Okay. Can everyone
just close our mouths?

948
00:38:50.632 --> 00:38:53.418
Let's just be adults. right?

949
00:38:53.548 --> 00:38:57.335
Okay. they're just
some normal. attractive men.

950
00:38:57.465 --> 00:39:00.555
It's nothing to lose your
minds over. It's...

951
00:39:04.777 --> 00:39:06.169
- You okay?
- Oh. my God.

952
00:39:07.083 --> 00:39:09.216
It was eight coke bags.

953
00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:11.871
It was eight. I just
felt it burst.

954
00:39:15.614 --> 00:39:17.964
Your mouth is
pretty fuckin' big too.

955
00:39:18.094 --> 00:39:20.096
Are you horny? Finger me twice
if you're horny.

956
00:39:20.227 --> 00:39:22.055
Kat?

957
00:39:22.185 --> 00:39:25.058
Oh. shit.
What's up. <i>chica?</i>

958
00:39:25.188 --> 00:39:27.321
- Fancy seeing you here.

959
00:39:27.452 --> 00:39:29.845
- I have no idea who you are.
- Wait. Todd?

960
00:39:29.976 --> 00:39:32.413
- What are you doing in China?
- Hey. China!

961
00:39:32.544 --> 00:39:34.110
- Oh. man. you know...

962
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:36.417
I'm just out here
hoopin' professionally.

963
00:39:36.548 --> 00:39:37.897
Why is Kat pretending
like she doesn't know me?

964
00:39:38.027 --> 00:39:39.638
Uh. my name's not Kat.

965
00:39:39.768 --> 00:39:40.900
Yeah. no. that's not Kat.

966
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:44.077
That's... Hermione.

967
00:39:44.207 --> 00:39:46.427
I'm Ron. This is Harry.

968
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:48.168
- Hagrid.
- This...

969
00:39:48.298 --> 00:39:49.561
Okay.

970
00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:51.040
Just one sec.

971
00:39:51.171 --> 00:39:52.999
Okay. Yeah.

972
00:39:53.129 --> 00:39:56.350
Hey. not Kat. Um. mmm.

973
00:39:56.481 --> 00:39:58.439
You know. sometimes I just
find myself

974
00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.615
thinkin' back to this time
when me and someone who looks

975
00:40:00.746 --> 00:40:03.096
so much like you rode out
to the Grand Canyon

976
00:40:03.226 --> 00:40:06.229
in my Ford F-150
pick-up truck. And then...

977
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.535
You used to bang this dude?

978
00:40:08.275 --> 00:40:09.711
Yeah.

979
00:40:09.842 --> 00:40:11.800
- No. I'm actually engaged now.
- Whoa. Okay.

980
00:40:11.931 --> 00:40:13.280
- So I have a...
- Okay. Yeah. No. that's cool.

981
00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:14.586
- I see that.
-  ...fiance.

982
00:40:14.716 --> 00:40:17.023
Yep. That's okay.
Great. Thank you. Wow.

983
00:40:17.153 --> 00:40:20.069
I'm happy for you. Huang.
That's awesome.

984
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.550
- Oh. man. Hey.

985
00:40:22.681 --> 00:40:24.117
- I'm happy you're puttin' that

986
00:40:24.247 --> 00:40:26.728
big ol' mouth of yours to
good use. huh?

987
00:40:26.859 --> 00:40:28.295
- Good seeing you.

988
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:29.905
-  Oh. my God.
- You all have a good night.

989
00:40:30.036 --> 00:40:31.167
- Good seeing ya.
- Yeah. you too.

990
00:40:31.298 --> 00:40:32.995
- Yeah.
- Okay.

991
00:40:33.822 --> 00:40:35.520
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

992
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:37.043
So we know what's
happening tonight.

993
00:40:37.173 --> 00:40:40.829
No. no. I'm not hooking up
with Todd. okay? Okay?

994
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.005
I am not horny at all.

995
00:40:43.136 --> 00:40:47.575
The coke that literally just
exploded inside my butthole

996
00:40:47.706 --> 00:40:50.230
has no effect
on me whatsoever.

997
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.362
Um. I am gonna go now.

998
00:40:52.493 --> 00:40:55.235
Have fun DJing
in between your legs tonight.

999
00:40:56.758 --> 00:40:58.281
Oh. shit.
Baron just texted me.

1000
00:40:58.412 --> 00:40:59.631
Okay. Promise me

1001
00:40:59.761 --> 00:41:01.110
- you'll have some fun tonight.
- Okay.

1002
00:41:01.241 --> 00:41:03.156
All right. hit the bar.
Let loose. okay?

1003
00:41:03.286 --> 00:41:04.549
Okay. Great.

1004
00:41:04.679 --> 00:41:06.246
- Linsanity!

1005
00:41:06.376 --> 00:41:07.943
Lin... Oh. Lin-Manuel Miranda?

1006
00:41:10.293 --> 00:41:11.991
So much to learn.

1007
00:41:12.121 --> 00:41:13.688
Finally. those two
fuckin' losers are gone.

1008
00:41:14.646 --> 00:41:16.735
Now it's just two cool cats.

1009
00:41:16.865 --> 00:41:18.911
Dynamic duo.
Thelma and Louise.

1010
00:41:19.041 --> 00:41:21.174
- We hangin' or what?
- I actually have a lot of...

1011
00:41:21.304 --> 00:41:22.610
I gotta do some work.

1012
00:41:22.741 --> 00:41:24.873
Yeah. Study buddies.
MVP of group projects.

1013
00:41:25.004 --> 00:41:26.135
I actually really need
some alone time.

1014
00:41:27.006 --> 00:41:28.311
Yeah. Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1015
00:41:28.877 --> 00:41:30.313
Um...

1016
00:41:30.444 --> 00:41:32.794
No. but you should...
You should have some fun.

1017
00:41:32.925 --> 00:41:34.056
- Yeah.
- They seem really nice.

1018
00:41:34.187 --> 00:41:35.580
You should go...
Oh. my God. Wait. look.

1019
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.843
He has a BTS shirt on.
You should go talk to him.

1020
00:41:37.973 --> 00:41:38.931
- Really?
- Yeah.

1021
00:41:39.061 --> 00:41:40.062
No.

1022
00:41:40.193 --> 00:41:42.282
I... Okay.

1023
00:41:42.412 --> 00:41:44.893
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
okay? Get some sleep.

1024
00:41:45.024 --> 00:41:45.981
Okay. See you.

1025
00:42:10.005 --> 00:42:12.921
Oh. I'm so sorry.
I don't speak Chinese.

1026
00:42:13.052 --> 00:42:14.967
- Hi.
- Hi.

1027
00:42:15.097 --> 00:42:16.708
I'm Kenny. Uh. this is Arvind.

1028
00:42:16.838 --> 00:42:18.753
I think he wanted
to buy you a drink.

1029
00:42:18.884 --> 00:42:20.886
- But he only speaks Chinese.
- Oh.

1030
00:42:21.016 --> 00:42:24.890
And Hindi. which I'm assuming
you don't speak.

1031
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.632
Oh. no.
I don't. Sorry. I'm...

1032
00:42:27.762 --> 00:42:30.939
I'm just a garbage American
who only speaks English.

1033
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:32.898
And a little Gollum.

1034
00:42:33.028 --> 00:42:36.249
"My precious!"

1035
00:42:36.379 --> 00:42:38.294
"They are filthy Hobbitses!"

1036
00:42:39.687 --> 00:42:41.733
- Do you guys have that here?
- Uh. yeah. we have.

1037
00:42:41.863 --> 00:42:43.952
It's all over the world.

1038
00:42:44.083 --> 00:42:45.693
- Right.
- Yeah. Um...

1039
00:43:01.361 --> 00:43:02.971
- Shit.

1040
00:43:04.407 --> 00:43:05.452
Hey.

1041
00:43:06.845 --> 00:43:08.324
Hello.

1042
00:43:08.455 --> 00:43:09.978
It's hot in here. huh?

1043
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:11.066
The AC broken or somethin'?

1044
00:43:11.197 --> 00:43:12.677
Oh. my God.

1045
00:43:12.807 --> 00:43:14.766
Whoa.

1046
00:43:17.638 --> 00:43:18.639
Lolo.

1047
00:43:19.901 --> 00:43:22.295
- Baron.
- What's up?

1048
00:43:22.425 --> 00:43:24.993
One more round of Yobo. please.

1049
00:43:25.124 --> 00:43:28.344
And I know China is supposed
to be my homeland but...

1050
00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:31.304
I don't know.
Ever since I got here.

1051
00:43:31.434 --> 00:43:32.740
I just. I feel like I'm doing
everything wrong.

1052
00:43:32.871 --> 00:43:35.438
Firstly. there is no way
to do Chinese wrong.

1053
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:37.266
- Right.
- But secondly.

1054
00:43:37.397 --> 00:43:38.964
what's the one thing
you've been saying the most?

1055
00:43:39.094 --> 00:43:41.401
- I don't know.
-"I."

1056
00:43:41.531 --> 00:43:44.099
You've been saying.
"I can't eat the food."

1057
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.971
"I am doing everything wrong."

1058
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:48.626
It's not about that.
The thing is. in China.

1059
00:43:48.756 --> 00:43:51.063
the collective is much bigger
than the individual.

1060
00:43:51.193 --> 00:43:53.152
all right?
It's like me and Arvind.

1061
00:43:53.282 --> 00:43:54.370
We're not from here.

1062
00:43:54.501 --> 00:43:56.416
But now we call this
our home. Right?

1063
00:43:56.546 --> 00:43:58.897
See? He teaches me some Hindi.

1064
00:43:59.027 --> 00:44:00.202
I taught him
how to fuck spiders.

1065
00:44:00.333 --> 00:44:01.421
What?

1066
00:44:01.551 --> 00:44:02.814
- It's an Australian thing.
- Huh?

1067
00:44:02.944 --> 00:44:04.598
But you just gotta
give it some time

1068
00:44:04.729 --> 00:44:06.165
and find your people.

1069
00:44:06.295 --> 00:44:08.689
That was really insightful.

1070
00:44:12.475 --> 00:44:13.738
Wait.

1071
00:44:13.868 --> 00:44:15.087
You and this Clarence dude
have been dating

1072
00:44:15.217 --> 00:44:16.479
for over three years

1073
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:18.394
- and never had sex?

1074
00:44:20.788 --> 00:44:22.572
Kat Huang I knew in college
couldn't last three days.

1075
00:44:22.703 --> 00:44:24.574
That is all in the past.

1076
00:44:25.575 --> 00:44:27.621
I am different now.

1077
00:44:27.752 --> 00:44:30.450
Katherine Huang has got
her shit together.

1078
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.017
I get it.

1079
00:44:32.147 --> 00:44:34.672
I was bangin' so many random
girls after every game.

1080
00:44:34.802 --> 00:44:37.370
- So many.

1081
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:38.588
And I just thought to myself.

1082
00:44:38.719 --> 00:44:39.720
"Man. you gotta cut
this shit out."

1083
00:44:39.851 --> 00:44:41.722
- Like...

1084
00:44:41.853 --> 00:44:43.202
...I gotta get serious

1085
00:44:43.332 --> 00:44:44.551
if I'm ever gonna find
a real one. you know?

1086
00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:47.206
Kinda like what you
and Clarice have.

1087
00:44:47.336 --> 00:44:49.599
His name is actually.
uh. Clarence but...

1088
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:51.514
-  Oh! Ow!

1089
00:44:51.645 --> 00:44:53.038
- Fuck!
- Are you okay?

1090
00:44:53.168 --> 00:44:54.604
Uh. no. no. no. no. I'm fine.

1091
00:44:54.735 --> 00:44:56.911
I probably just. uh...
Uh. just pulled something.

1092
00:44:57.042 --> 00:44:58.347
Let's get you off. Come on.
Hop up. Hop up.

1093
00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:01.046
Breathe. Breathe.
Come on. Up. up.

1094
00:45:01.176 --> 00:45:02.700
Yeah. Okay.
You're doin' great.

1095
00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.137
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
Oh. Okay.

1096
00:45:05.267 --> 00:45:06.660
- Okay.

1097
00:45:06.791 --> 00:45:08.140
I actually have something
that might help.

1098
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:09.576
Okay.

1099
00:45:10.925 --> 00:45:12.013
Okay.

1100
00:45:12.144 --> 00:45:13.145
May I?

1101
00:45:14.015 --> 00:45:15.016
Uh...

1102
00:45:19.499 --> 00:45:21.283
Yeah.

1103
00:45:21.414 --> 00:45:22.850
This is what
I've been working on.

1104
00:45:22.981 --> 00:45:24.547
You're such a great artist.

1105
00:45:24.678 --> 00:45:25.984
How do you come up
with this stuff?

1106
00:45:26.114 --> 00:45:28.334
I just want people
to be more body positive.

1107
00:45:28.464 --> 00:45:30.205
You know. sex isn't shameful.

1108
00:45:30.336 --> 00:45:32.599
It's beautiful.
Like. the noises?

1109
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:33.992
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1110
00:45:46.265 --> 00:45:48.441
- I'm into that shit too.
- Look. at first.

1111
00:45:48.571 --> 00:45:51.661
I know my art seems like
it's for shock value.

1112
00:45:51.792 --> 00:45:53.185
- But...
- Mmm-hmm.

1113
00:45:53.315 --> 00:45:54.926
...I'm just tryin' to get
the conversation going.

1114
00:45:59.626 --> 00:46:01.019
He says he really likes you.

1115
00:46:01.149 --> 00:46:02.455
Well. I like him too.

1116
00:46:03.151 --> 00:46:04.413
I like both of you.

1117
00:46:04.544 --> 00:46:05.893
God. I wish there were
more of you guys

1118
00:46:06.024 --> 00:46:07.373
when I was growing up.

1119
00:46:07.503 --> 00:46:09.723
Maybe I would've had
an Asian boyfriend by now.

1120
00:46:09.854 --> 00:46:11.246
Or two.

1121
00:46:21.213 --> 00:46:22.997
God. that's so hot.

1122
00:46:23.128 --> 00:46:25.391
He said he wants to
make you scream.

1123
00:46:27.654 --> 00:46:28.873
Will you tell him I love that

1124
00:46:30.526 --> 00:46:32.528
but maybe it'd be better
if his friend joined in.

1125
00:46:36.271 --> 00:46:38.273
- Tongue. Lips.

1126
00:46:38.404 --> 00:46:40.101
- Tongue. Faster.

1127
00:46:40.232 --> 00:46:41.799
Breathe with me.

1128
00:46:44.453 --> 00:46:45.498
You feelin' that?

1129
00:46:45.628 --> 00:46:47.152
Ah!

1130
00:46:47.848 --> 00:46:48.806
Let it in.

1131
00:46:57.945 --> 00:46:59.164
Do you like hair pulling?

1132
00:46:59.294 --> 00:47:00.600
I love it.

1133
00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:01.906
- Yeah. you like that?

1134
00:47:02.036 --> 00:47:03.124
- No!

1135
00:47:03.255 --> 00:47:05.431
- Now give me the basketball.
- What?

1136
00:47:05.561 --> 00:47:06.954
Just give it to me!

1137
00:47:23.362 --> 00:47:24.580
<i>Audrey.
I just heard you haven't</i>

1138
00:47:24.711 --> 00:47:26.104
<i>closed the ChinaWave deal.</i>

1139
00:47:26.234 --> 00:47:27.670
Shit. Shit. shit. shit. shit.
shit. shit. shit.

1140
00:47:27.801 --> 00:47:29.759
- Hi. Frank.
- Who the fuck is Frank?

1141
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:31.849
Yeah. no.
it's as good as done.

1142
00:47:31.979 --> 00:47:33.589
Um. I just need until Friday
to make it official.

1143
00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.940
<i>Okay. we're not payin' you
to be on vacation out there.</i>

1144
00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:38.986
Don't worry. I'm very...
Very close.

1145
00:47:39.117 --> 00:47:40.901
<i>Hell yeah. you are.
You're about to finish.</i>

1146
00:47:41.032 --> 00:47:43.208
<i>so just keep grinding.
Bend over backwards</i>

1147
00:47:43.382 --> 00:47:44.644
<i>- if you have to.
- Yeah.</i> okay. Okay.

1148
00:47:57.439 --> 00:48:00.138
- Whoa.
- I want you to feel this too.

1149
00:48:03.141 --> 00:48:04.664
Ah!

1150
00:48:13.107 --> 00:48:14.892
Sugar. anyone?
- I'll have some.

1151
00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:17.633
One lump or two lumps?

1152
00:48:17.764 --> 00:48:19.984
- Two.

1153
00:48:20.114 --> 00:48:22.029
- Oop.

1154
00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.465
So. how was everyone's night?

1155
00:48:23.596 --> 00:48:25.032
- Restful. I feel rested.
- Mmm-hmm.

1156
00:48:25.163 --> 00:48:26.425
The beds are comfortable here.

1157
00:48:26.555 --> 00:48:28.601
Lolo!
What the fuck happened?

1158
00:48:30.995 --> 00:48:33.432
Jiaying. torn hamstring.

1159
00:48:34.302 --> 00:48:37.523
Arvind. Ken. concussions.

1160
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:41.875
Todd. shattered
fucking pelvis!

1161
00:48:42.006 --> 00:48:45.183
Hello. kitty Kat.

1162
00:48:45.313 --> 00:48:47.925
You and your girls
destroyed our team.

1163
00:48:48.055 --> 00:48:50.449
Now I have to go
play the game by myself.

1164
00:48:50.579 --> 00:48:52.016
Get y'all ass on the bus.

1165
00:48:55.584 --> 00:48:56.672
Sorry.

1166
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.809
Wait. you were supposed to be

1167
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.463
- Oh. shit.

1168
00:49:04.593 --> 00:49:06.552
You know what?

1195
00:50:20.147 --> 00:50:22.628
Of course. But just know
that they're a lot.

1196
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:07.281
Very good.

1197
00:51:07.412 --> 00:51:08.935
Okay. Wait.

1198
00:51:09.066 --> 00:51:09.979
- What. what's he saying?
- They think

1199
00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:11.459
you're very beautiful.

1200
00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:13.244
And any mother. uh.

1201
00:51:13.374 --> 00:51:14.723
would be lucky
to have you as a daughter.

1202
00:51:16.943 --> 00:51:18.162
Thank... Thank you.

1203
00:51:18.336 --> 00:51:19.815
Uh. <i>Xie... Xiexie.</i>

1204
00:51:19.946 --> 00:51:23.123
Oh. have some
chocolate. This a favorite.

1205
00:51:23.254 --> 00:51:25.604
This is the chocolate of
"Chinese" Chinese people.

1206
00:51:25.734 --> 00:51:27.127
Shit. This means
she likes you.

1207
00:51:27.258 --> 00:51:28.737
If you see Russell Stover.
you're fucked.

1208
00:51:28.868 --> 00:51:31.044
[IN ENGLISH] Okay.

1209
00:51:31.175 --> 00:51:34.874
In this house. you are family.

1210
00:51:35.004 --> 00:51:37.442
<i>Ganbei!</i>

1211
00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:51.456
Whoa. Okay.

1212
00:51:58.158 --> 00:51:59.507
So. is this a Chinese card game?

1213
00:51:59.638 --> 00:52:01.335
No. I just made it up
to win their money.

1214
00:52:01.466 --> 00:52:02.945
I tell them
it's an American game.

1215
00:52:05.383 --> 00:52:06.340
Ah?

1216
00:52:08.473 --> 00:52:10.127
Hey. Deadeye.

1217
00:52:10.257 --> 00:52:11.911
Why you so grumpy?

1218
00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:14.087
You should smile more.

1219
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:17.090
- Like Audrey.
- Oh.

1220
00:52:24.402 --> 00:52:26.534
It's nice that you have
such a big family.

1221
00:52:26.665 --> 00:52:28.232
I'm not really like my family.

1222
00:52:28.362 --> 00:52:30.408
Well. you and me. both.

1223
00:52:30.538 --> 00:52:32.236
Really?

1224
00:52:32.366 --> 00:52:34.716
I feel like you and your
parents are kinda the same.

1225
00:52:34.847 --> 00:52:36.414
I mean. you're basically white.
No offense.

1226
00:52:36.544 --> 00:52:40.592
I'm Chinese. I'm not white.

1227
00:52:40.722 --> 00:52:43.812
I'm sorry.
I say so many stupid things.

1228
00:52:43.943 --> 00:52:45.031
That's why my family thinks

1229
00:52:45.162 --> 00:52:46.946
I'm socially awkward
and too weird.

1230
00:52:47.076 --> 00:52:48.121
You think I am too.

1231
00:52:50.384 --> 00:52:52.081
- No. I don't.
- I heard you in the airport.

1232
00:52:52.212 --> 00:52:53.300
No. I. I didn't mean that. It...

1233
00:52:53.431 --> 00:52:54.388
It... It's okay.

1234
00:52:55.824 --> 00:52:56.956
I'm used to it.

1235
00:53:02.962 --> 00:53:04.093
You know why I like K-pop?

1236
00:53:04.224 --> 00:53:05.269
No. Why?

1237
00:53:06.618 --> 00:53:08.097
Because it likes me back.

1238
00:53:08.228 --> 00:53:10.274
Yeah. it's not
just awesome songs.

1239
00:53:10.404 --> 00:53:13.538
it's about what we created
because we love the music.

1240
00:53:13.668 --> 00:53:14.974
It's about us.

1241
00:53:15.104 --> 00:53:16.323
I've never thought
about it that way.

1242
00:53:16.454 --> 00:53:19.196
- The... The community.
- But it's not real.

1243
00:53:19.326 --> 00:53:21.023
I haven't met any of them.

1244
00:53:21.154 --> 00:53:24.157
I just talk to them online.
I don't have any real friends.

1245
00:53:24.288 --> 00:53:26.855
- Well. we're friends.
- Really?

1246
00:53:26.986 --> 00:53:29.336
'Cause we're gonna be home
in a couple of days.

1247
00:53:29.467 --> 00:53:31.295
Do you actually think
we're gonna hang out?

1248
00:53:31.425 --> 00:53:33.427
- Yeah. we could. Of course.
- I don't know.

1249
00:53:33.558 --> 00:53:35.951
Everyone likes you. You're cool.

1250
00:53:36.082 --> 00:53:37.736
Your hair smells
like a cookie.

1251
00:53:39.477 --> 00:53:40.652
- Your life is perfect.

1252
00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:42.697
Well. it's not.

1253
00:53:44.525 --> 00:53:46.440
But sometimes
even I feel like...

1254
00:53:47.833 --> 00:53:50.401
You... You know.
I don't really belong either.

1255
00:53:51.445 --> 00:53:52.490
You know?

1256
00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:02.151
So. so what kind of music
do you like to listen to?

1257
00:54:02.282 --> 00:54:03.892
I mean. I love Mumford Sons.

1258
00:54:04.806 --> 00:54:07.026
Uh. The National.

1259
00:54:07.156 --> 00:54:08.984
- Maroon Five. The best.
- Yes.

1260
00:54:09.115 --> 00:54:10.899
- T Swift is my...
- Uh-huh.

1261
00:54:12.945 --> 00:54:14.076
I've really been
liking Cardi B.

1262
00:54:14.207 --> 00:54:16.340
- I love Cardi B.
- Oh. cool.

1263
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:19.647
Yeah. You know. K-pop owes
so much to hip-hop.

1264
00:54:22.433 --> 00:54:23.695
Suck it. Bao Bao!

1265
00:54:23.825 --> 00:54:25.914
Bao Bao!

1266
00:54:34.401 --> 00:54:36.621
- You in that thing yet?
- Almost.

1267
00:54:36.751 --> 00:54:38.492
It's nice of Nai Nai
to let me borrow this.

1268
00:54:38.623 --> 00:54:40.538
Yeah. You're lucky
she likes you.

1269
00:54:40.668 --> 00:54:43.367
- She doesn't like anyone.
- Well. I like her. too.

1270
00:54:43.497 --> 00:54:45.064
I like your whole family. Lo.

1271
00:54:45.194 --> 00:54:47.240
It's funny. all night
I kept thinking about

1272
00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:49.242
what it'd be like
if I'd grown up here.

1273
00:54:49.373 --> 00:54:50.809
- Mmm.
- I'd be like everyone else.

1274
00:54:50.939 --> 00:54:52.419
you know?

1275
00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:54.900
People wouldn't stare at me
at the grocery store.

1276
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:56.902
Or ask my parents
where they got me from.

1277
00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:03.561
I wouldn't always
just be the Asian girl.

1278
00:55:03.691 --> 00:55:07.086
You know. I could.
I could be the smart girl.

1279
00:55:07.216 --> 00:55:10.655
Or... or the nice. funny girl.

1280
00:55:10.785 --> 00:55:13.310
I wonder if I'd still feel
like I had to be perfect

1281
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.486
all the time just to belong.

1282
00:55:15.616 --> 00:55:17.966
I don't know. Maybe my whole
life would be different.

1283
00:55:18.097 --> 00:55:19.664
I don't think it'd be
that much different.

1284
00:55:23.232 --> 00:55:24.712
Wow. bitch.

1285
00:55:24.843 --> 00:55:26.497
It's nice. right?

1286
00:55:26.627 --> 00:55:28.499
China looks good on you.

1287
00:55:28.629 --> 00:55:30.022
I kind of love it.

1288
00:55:31.153 --> 00:55:33.112
- Hey. thanks.
- For what?

1289
00:55:33.242 --> 00:55:35.593
I'm so grateful that
you pushed me to do this.

1290
00:55:37.682 --> 00:55:39.640
I don't think I could have
done it without you.

1291
00:55:39.771 --> 00:55:41.250
- I got you.

1292
00:55:42.991 --> 00:55:45.994
Ooh. Wow!

1293
00:55:46.125 --> 00:55:50.477
You look gorgeous.

1294
00:55:50.608 --> 00:55:53.045
You know.
I wore that dress the night

1295
00:55:53.175 --> 00:55:57.615
I was deflowered
by the love of my life.

1296
00:55:57.745 --> 00:55:59.660
- Aw. Grandpa?
- No.

1297
00:55:59.791 --> 00:56:00.835
Oh.

1298
00:56:10.628 --> 00:56:11.585
That's it.

1299
00:56:14.675 --> 00:56:15.807
You ready?

1300
00:56:17.722 --> 00:56:18.679
Okay.

1301
00:56:19.724 --> 00:56:20.681
Hey!

1302
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.302
Oh. Hi. My. my name is Audrey.

1303
00:56:33.433 --> 00:56:35.000
I'm... I'm looking
for my mother.

1304
00:56:36.305 --> 00:56:38.090
You brought the picture?

1305
00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:39.918
Yeah. I just...

1306
00:56:40.048 --> 00:56:41.485
thought it would be nice
to have in China.

1307
00:57:00.068 --> 00:57:00.982
She knew you.

1308
00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:05.378
Does she know my mother?

1309
00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:23.222
What is she saying?

1310
00:57:23.352 --> 00:57:24.397
Okay. what's. what's going on?

1311
00:57:24.528 --> 00:57:25.920
Does she know where my mom is?

1312
00:57:31.186 --> 00:57:33.537
You. Korea girl.

1313
00:57:34.799 --> 00:57:35.843
Uh...

1314
00:57:37.845 --> 00:57:39.891
Your mom's name is Min Park.

1315
00:57:40.021 --> 00:57:41.414
That... That's a mistake.

1316
00:57:41.545 --> 00:57:43.460
I'm... I'm Chinese.

1317
00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:46.158
I... I went to Chinese school
for a year.

1318
00:57:46.288 --> 00:57:48.552
I... I... We... We celebrated
Chinese New Year's. I...

1319
00:57:48.682 --> 00:57:51.598
But Korea's great. I mean.
there's... There's mukbang.

1320
00:57:51.729 --> 00:57:53.165
soju. Hyundai. <i>Gangnam Style.</i>

1321
00:57:53.295 --> 00:57:55.646
half of Hines Ward.
half of Charles Melton.

1322
00:57:55.776 --> 00:57:57.038
all of Randall Park.

1323
00:58:10.051 --> 00:58:11.879
I want my dress back.

1324
00:58:18.146 --> 00:58:19.496
Stop being so racist!

1325
00:58:27.591 --> 00:58:28.896
My whole life has been wrong.

1326
00:58:30.071 --> 00:58:31.508
It hasn't.

1327
00:58:31.638 --> 00:58:34.075
We're only friends because
my parents were. like.

1328
00:58:34.206 --> 00:58:36.034
"Ooh. another little
Chinese girl."

1329
00:58:36.164 --> 00:58:37.514
In everyone's defense.

1330
00:58:37.644 --> 00:58:39.167
we were the only
Asian people in town.

1331
00:58:39.298 --> 00:58:40.734
So we still
would've been friends.

1332
00:58:40.865 --> 00:58:42.562
White people
don't know the difference.

1333
00:58:42.693 --> 00:58:44.129
- My parents are white.
So what
if you're Korean?

1334
00:58:44.259 --> 00:58:45.609
We all end up in the same place.

1335
00:58:45.739 --> 00:58:46.740
Walking around town
with our hands

1336
00:58:46.871 --> 00:58:48.002
behind our back. like this.

1337
00:58:53.486 --> 00:58:55.401
That's enough.
That's enough.

1338
00:58:55.532 --> 00:58:57.882
Fuck this.

1339
00:58:58.012 --> 00:58:59.231
I mean...

1340
00:58:59.361 --> 00:59:02.277
This whole birth mom
journey is bullshit.

1341
00:59:06.281 --> 00:59:07.282
You know what?

1342
00:59:08.588 --> 00:59:09.981
I only wanted to find her

1343
00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:11.330
to close this
fucking business deal.

1344
00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:12.723
I don't actually give a shit

1345
00:59:12.853 --> 00:59:16.291
if I'm a Korean lawyer
or a Chinese lawyer

1346
00:59:16.422 --> 00:59:19.251
or a fucking German lawyer.
because I'm a lawyer.

1347
00:59:19.381 --> 00:59:20.644
And I'm goin' to
finish this job.

1348
00:59:20.774 --> 00:59:22.123
This is all a lot. you know?

1349
00:59:22.254 --> 00:59:23.429
You don't have to
think about work right now.

1350
00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.822
This says
she's in Seoul. right?

1351
00:59:24.952 --> 00:59:26.345
- That's what you said earlier?
Uh. yeah.

1352
00:59:26.475 --> 00:59:29.566
Okay. So. if we go to
Seoul right now.

1353
00:59:29.696 --> 00:59:31.872
I could still find her
and bring her back in time

1354
00:59:32.003 --> 00:59:33.570
- to go to Chao's dinner.
- But there are probably. like.

1355
00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.702
ten thousand Min Parks
in Korea.

1356
00:59:35.833 --> 00:59:37.051
Yes. but we have
all of her info right here.

1357
00:59:37.182 --> 00:59:38.792
We can hire
a private investigator

1358
00:59:38.923 --> 00:59:40.489
- to track her down.
- I'm so in.

1359
00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:43.014
Thank you. Thank you. Deadeye.
You're an amazing friend.

1360
00:59:43.144 --> 00:59:44.319
Lolo. are you in?

1361
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:45.756
I mean. this is what
you wanted. right?

1362
00:59:45.886 --> 00:59:47.061
- I'm in. I'm in. yeah.
- Yes. Thank you.

1363
00:59:47.192 --> 00:59:48.497
Thank you. Let's go.

1364
00:59:48.628 --> 00:59:50.064
Passports. Passports.
Where are our passports?

1365
00:59:50.195 --> 00:59:52.240
Oh. they are in my suitcase
that got stolen.

1366
00:59:52.371 --> 00:59:53.677
We don't need fuckin' passports.
Let's go.

1367
00:59:53.807 --> 00:59:55.461
Let's think.
No bad ideas. Let's go.

1368
00:59:55.592 --> 00:59:56.897
We could flash
our titties and just

1369
00:59:57.028 --> 00:59:58.420
- hitchhike the whole way.
- That's a bad idea.

1370
00:59:58.551 --> 01:00:00.161
We could take
a rocket to space

1371
01:00:00.292 --> 01:00:01.946
and then try to land in Korea.
No customs in the atmosphere.

1372
01:00:02.076 --> 01:00:03.251
I feel like that's worse.

1373
01:00:03.382 --> 01:00:05.384
Okay. uh. we become
mail-order brides.

1374
01:00:05.514 --> 01:00:06.690
uh. and then we...
We find a really big envelope

1375
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:07.908
and then we could just...

1376
01:00:08.039 --> 01:00:09.562
I fuckin' love that spirit. Deadeye.

1377
01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:10.998
- Just keep thinking.
- We take coke again

1378
01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:13.610
- and we just sprint.
-  No more coke!

1379
01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.089
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.
Come on. guys.

1380
01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:16.569
- We could swim there.
- Okay.

1381
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.179
Yeah. How. how long can you
hold your breath?

1382
01:00:19.659 --> 01:00:21.008
That's it! That's it!
I can't do it anymore!

1383
01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:22.401
Not long enough. Okay. look.
Ready? Ready? Ready?

1384
01:00:22.531 --> 01:00:23.620
You know who can
bypass airport security?

1385
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:26.535
- The Obamas.
- Yes. And K-pop stars.

1386
01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:28.494
We are not K-pop stars.

1387
01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:29.626
Not yet. we aren't.

1388
01:00:46.599 --> 01:00:48.819
So. are we sure
this is gonna work?

1389
01:00:48.949 --> 01:00:50.603
BTS Army always comes through.

1390
01:00:50.734 --> 01:00:52.736
@Jinderalla88 said
we should be good to go.

1391
01:00:52.866 --> 01:00:54.607
Just act confident.
We're Brownie Tuesday.

1392
01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:55.826
We're a brand-new group.

1393
01:00:55.956 --> 01:00:57.349
We just did our debut
in Shanghai.

1394
01:00:57.479 --> 01:01:00.221
Our first single has
nine million downloads.

1395
01:01:00.352 --> 01:01:01.440
Everyone remember their names?

1396
01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:02.528
- Sassy.
- Cutie.

1397
01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.051
- Lisa.
- Lisa "two".

1398
01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:06.314
- We got this.
- We got this.

1399
01:01:06.445 --> 01:01:07.751
Where are your passports?

1400
01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:10.492
- We're Brownie Tuesday.
- Yeah. We signed with

1401
01:01:10.623 --> 01:01:12.756
Hit Bang Entertainment
last week. That's our jet.

1402
01:01:12.886 --> 01:01:14.409
Where are your
travel documents?

1403
01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.542
Do you even know
the name of your booking?

1404
01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.675
Yeah. Uh. @Jinderalla88.

1405
01:01:18.805 --> 01:01:20.024
Please leave.

1406
01:01:20.154 --> 01:01:21.982
I thought you said
your friend set this up.

1407
01:01:27.161 --> 01:01:28.162
I knew it.

1408
01:01:30.469 --> 01:01:32.036
They're just online friends.
They're not real friends.

1409
01:01:32.166 --> 01:01:33.211
No. no. It's okay.

1410
01:01:33.341 --> 01:01:34.386
We'll figure
something else out.

1411
01:01:34.516 --> 01:01:35.909
No. no.
This always happens to me.

1412
01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.824
I make friends.
but they never come through.

1413
01:01:39.608 --> 01:01:41.567
No one wants to be my friend.

1414
01:01:45.484 --> 01:01:46.659
This is all so

1415
01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:47.834
- fucking stupid.

1416
01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:52.970
Deadeye. look.

1417
01:01:55.015 --> 01:01:55.973
Deadeye?

1418
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:58.497
@Jinderalla88?

1419
01:01:58.627 --> 01:02:01.630
Yes. honey. The one and only.

1420
01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:03.850
Okay. slay.

1421
01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:06.026
You'd make V very proud.

1422
01:02:06.157 --> 01:02:08.028
I'm pretending
to be your manager.

1423
01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:09.769
We even brought you fans!

1424
01:02:16.863 --> 01:02:20.649
Give it up for
Brownie Tuesday!

1425
01:02:27.439 --> 01:02:28.701
Hi.

1426
01:02:28.832 --> 01:02:31.443
Can they get on their jet now?

1427
01:02:31.573 --> 01:02:33.271
I don't believe
these girls are singers.

1428
01:02:33.401 --> 01:02:34.751
I can
assure you that these are

1429
01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:36.535
professional idols.
And they've been training

1430
01:02:36.665 --> 01:02:38.755
since they were
14 and 15 years old.

1431
01:02:38.885 --> 01:02:40.713
Girls. show them.

1432
01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:42.149
Um. what. what?

1433
01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.237
- Show them what?
Uh. just show 'em.

1434
01:02:43.368 --> 01:02:44.325
Well. just show them.

1435
01:02:44.456 --> 01:02:45.718
Hello? What are supposed
to show?

1436
01:02:47.198 --> 01:02:48.373
You're a fan of Cardi B. right?

1437
01:02:48.503 --> 01:02:49.504
Yeah. but is she here?

1438
01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:54.683
Just pretend that you're back
in the Tootles.

1439
01:02:55.815 --> 01:02:56.903
Trust me.

1440
01:03:01.168 --> 01:03:03.692

That is way bigger
than I expected.

No wonder you won't
have sex with Clarence.

1488
01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:51.191
- That thing is massive.
It's huge.

1489
01:04:51.322 --> 01:04:52.540
The artist did really
impressive work. Kat.

1490
01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:54.194
You don't understand.
I've tried lasers.

1491
01:04:54.325 --> 01:04:55.979

1492

Nothing will take.

Kat. it's gonna be okay.
It'll be okay.

1496
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:07.468
It will not be okay.
It's on the inside too.

1497
01:05:14.606 --> 01:05:15.607

I came for you.

1500
01:05:20.525 --> 01:05:22.396
- Wait. no. I can explain.
- No. I...

1501
01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:26.618

1502
01:05:30.839 --> 01:05:32.189

a public disturbance!

1506

And committed
an indecent exposure!

1507
01:05:40.762 --> 01:05:42.634
- We know.
- You must leave. Now!

1508
01:05:48.988 --> 01:05:50.076
Okay.

1509
01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:52.122

01:07:45.278 --> 01:07:47.150
-"I thought I thaw..."
- Don't say it!

1534
01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.021
- Weird. Chao's calling me.

1535
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:53.112
Hi. Chao.
So good to hear from you.

1536
01:07:53.243 --> 01:07:55.549
My mother and I were actually
just talking about you.

1537
01:07:55.723 --> 01:07:57.812
- Do not bother coming.
<i>- What?</i>

1538
01:07:57.943 --> 01:08:00.163
I saw the video of you
and your friend's

1539
01:08:00.337 --> 01:08:01.512
- devil vagina.
<i>- Let me explain.</i>

1540
01:08:01.642 --> 01:08:02.861
It's actually. it...
It's so hilarious.

1541
01:08:02.991 --> 01:08:04.428
You're gonna love this story.
It's...

1542
01:08:04.558 --> 01:08:05.951
- Um...
<i>- You lied to me.</i>

1543
01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:07.083
You told me you're in Beijing
with your mother.

1544
01:08:07.213 --> 01:08:08.997
But that's clearly not true.

1545
01:08:09.128 --> 01:08:10.564
I cannot do business
with someone

1546
01:08:10.695 --> 01:08:12.000
who's not who they
say they are.

1547
01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:13.219
Please. Just...
Just hear me out.

1548
01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:14.916
No. I've already
made up my mind.

1549
01:08:15.047 --> 01:08:16.701
I will tell your boss
that we are not

1550
01:08:16.875 --> 01:08:18.659
<i>- going to sign.</i>
- But. when you talk to Frank

1551
01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:20.008
can you please
just not mention

1552
01:08:20.139 --> 01:08:21.140
- the whole video thing?
- I already saw it.

1553
01:08:21.314 --> 01:08:22.402
- Shit!
<i>I didn't know</i>

1554
01:08:22.533 --> 01:08:23.969
<i>you were this shady. Audrey.</i>

1555
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.884
I mean. that is the last time
that I take a chance

1556
01:08:26.014 --> 01:08:27.364
on someone like you.

1557
01:08:27.494 --> 01:08:30.018
Again. I mean associate.
not an Asian.

1558
01:08:30.193 --> 01:08:32.151
<i>- Anyway. you're fired.</i>
- What?

1559
01:08:32.282 --> 01:08:34.240
Frank. No...
I... I can fix this.

1560
01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:35.937
I'm still an ally though.

1561
01:08:36.068 --> 01:08:37.548
I fired a white guy
earlier this week.

1562
01:08:37.678 --> 01:08:38.940
Did the exact same thing.

1563
01:08:39.071 --> 01:08:40.290
Okay. Frank. Frank?
Frank. don't hang up.

1564
01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:42.901
I'm gonna get fired
from my show.

1565
01:08:43.031 --> 01:08:44.381
And my movie.

1566
01:08:44.511 --> 01:08:46.774
And I'm never gonna go to LA.

1567
01:08:46.905 --> 01:08:48.689
It's okay.
It's not the end of the world.

1568
01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:51.127
No. it literally is
the end of the world.

1569
01:08:53.738 --> 01:08:57.350
Clarence and I were gonna rent
a house in Malibu.

1570
01:08:57.481 --> 01:09:00.266
And we were gonna be
one of those couples

1571
01:09:00.397 --> 01:09:04.836
who meditate every single day
and tell people about it

1572
01:09:04.966 --> 01:09:08.753
because that is what
people do in Los Angeles.

1573
01:09:08.883 --> 01:09:10.537
- It's okay.

1574
01:09:10.668 --> 01:09:13.540
And Audrey was gonna
hang out with us

1575
01:09:13.671 --> 01:09:16.282
all the time when
she moved there.

1576
01:09:20.199 --> 01:09:23.376
Audrey was gonna
move out to LA?

1577
01:09:23.507 --> 01:09:26.379
Once she closed the deal
and got promoted.

1578
01:09:28.686 --> 01:09:30.992
Why didn't you tell me
about LA?

1579
01:09:31.123 --> 01:09:33.865
- Lolo. I can't right now.
- What was your plan?

1580
01:09:33.995 --> 01:09:36.302
Were you just gonna move out
and never say anything?

1581
01:09:36.433 --> 01:09:37.564
It's not happening anymore.

1582
01:09:37.695 --> 01:09:38.913
I just got fired.

1583
01:09:39.044 --> 01:09:40.654
What?
- Chao saw the video.

1584
01:09:40.785 --> 01:09:43.179
- Your video.
- Yeah. well. whatever.

1585
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:44.745
Fuck them.
You'll get a new job.

1586
01:09:44.876 --> 01:09:46.443
- It's not that easy.
- For you. it will be.

1587
01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:48.749
Just go to the country club
where you play squash at.

1588
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.490
I'm pretty sure one of those
white guys will give you a job

1589
01:09:50.621 --> 01:09:52.100
- in. like. two seconds.
- What the fuck?

1590
01:09:52.231 --> 01:09:54.581
I worked hard for that job.

1591
01:09:54.712 --> 01:09:57.236
You know what? This is all
your fucking fault.

1592
01:09:57.367 --> 01:09:59.760
Four bears
for four best friends.

1593
01:09:59.891 --> 01:10:01.371
Cappuccino is for Audrey

1594
01:10:01.501 --> 01:10:03.199
because she doesn't like
to try anything weird.

1595
01:10:04.896 --> 01:10:07.028
- She's the best.
- You're a fucking idiot.

1596
01:10:07.159 --> 01:10:08.900
Telling Chao that
I knew my birth mom.

1597
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:11.250
Dragging us all over
the Chinese countryside.

1598
01:10:11.381 --> 01:10:12.512
I was doing this for you.

1599
01:10:12.643 --> 01:10:14.210
No. You were doing it
for yourself.

1600
01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:17.169
You still think we're kids
on some dumb grand adventure.

1601
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:19.519
Well. grow the fuck up. Lolo.
The rest of us are adults.

1602
01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:22.348
You're still a fucking child.
Okay. my life is ruined.

1603
01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.569
Your life is ruined?

1604
01:10:25.699 --> 01:10:28.267
My life is ruined. okay?

1605
01:10:28.398 --> 01:10:31.792
You can always find another
fucking desk job. okay?

1606
01:10:31.923 --> 01:10:34.621
I can never find
another Clarence.

1607
01:10:34.752 --> 01:10:35.970
And whose fault is that?

1608
01:10:36.101 --> 01:10:37.581
Maybe you should've
been honest with him

1609
01:10:37.711 --> 01:10:39.626
from the beginning instead of
lying every single day

1610
01:10:39.757 --> 01:10:41.019
for the past three years.

1611
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:42.673
Whoa. what the fuck?
That's her business.

1612
01:10:42.803 --> 01:10:44.892
And since when are you
the spokesperson for honesty?

1613
01:10:45.023 --> 01:10:47.982
Okay. so are... Are you two
best friends now?

1614
01:10:48.113 --> 01:10:49.288
What. like Lilo and Stitch?

1615
01:10:51.377 --> 01:10:52.944
You fuckin' suck
at impressions.

1616
01:10:55.599 --> 01:10:56.643
Go fuck yourself!

1617
01:10:56.774 --> 01:10:58.471
I'll knock
your teeth out. bitch!

1618
01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:05.217
I am an actress.

1619
01:11:05.348 --> 01:11:10.570
And even I am less
self-involved than you are.

1620
01:11:13.007 --> 01:11:14.008
Huh.

1621
01:11:15.575 --> 01:11:17.708
- Kat.
- You know what? Kat's right.

1622
01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:20.711
You've been a shitty friend.

1623
01:11:20.841 --> 01:11:22.843
This entire time.
I was helping you

1624
01:11:22.974 --> 01:11:24.497
so you could get
promoted and leave me?

1625
01:11:24.628 --> 01:11:26.543
- I was doing it for my career.
- Why?

1626
01:11:26.673 --> 01:11:28.240
I mean. you're always talkin'
about how you feel like

1627
01:11:28.371 --> 01:11:30.242
- you don't belong there.
- I don't belong anywhere.

1628
01:11:30.373 --> 01:11:31.635
I'm clearly not white.

1629
01:11:31.765 --> 01:11:33.245
but you're always
telling me that I am.

1630
01:11:33.376 --> 01:11:35.334
And I'm also not Asian enough.
At least not for you.

1631
01:11:35.465 --> 01:11:37.249
That's all in your head!
Your life is perfect!

1632
01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:38.685
How is my life perfect

1633
01:11:38.816 --> 01:11:40.774
when I spend all my time
babysitting a grown-ass

1634
01:11:40.905 --> 01:11:43.603
- 29-year-old woman?
- I'm babysitting you!

1635
01:11:43.734 --> 01:11:45.301
I've been saving your ass
since we were kids

1636
01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:47.346
- on the playground.
- You've never. ever

1637
01:11:47.477 --> 01:11:48.739
applied yourself. Lolo.

1638
01:11:48.869 --> 01:11:51.611
You wanna be a real artist?
Then grow up!

1639
01:11:51.742 --> 01:11:54.310
Right now. you're just
a barnacle with a cute hobby!

1640
01:11:56.137 --> 01:11:59.140
Yo. I may be a barnacle.
but at least I know who I am.

1641
01:12:00.185 --> 01:12:01.186
You know what?

1642
01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.015
If we didn't grow up

1643
01:12:04.145 --> 01:12:06.322
as the only two
Asian girls in town.

1644
01:12:08.019 --> 01:12:09.150
we never would've
been friends.

1645
01:12:43.533 --> 01:12:46.405
- Sorry.
Thank you so much
for waiting.

1646
01:12:46.536 --> 01:12:48.973
- We found the record

1647
01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:50.714
- of your birth mother.
- Oh. my gosh.

1648
01:12:53.586 --> 01:12:55.806
I... I can't read this. Um...

1649
01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.679
So do I call her or...

1650
01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:01.464
I... I'm sorry. I'd...
I don't know how this works.

1651
01:13:03.248 --> 01:13:05.163
I'm so sorry
to tell you that...

1652
01:13:06.294 --> 01:13:07.513
she's passed away.

1653
01:13:10.168 --> 01:13:12.605
I have the address
of where she was buried

1654
01:13:12.736 --> 01:13:15.129
if you would like
to visit her.

1655
01:13:15.956 --> 01:13:17.654
No. I'm. uh. um...

1656
01:13:17.784 --> 01:13:19.351
Do you have friend here?

1657
01:13:19.482 --> 01:13:22.006
- Someone you can call?
- No. Uh. it's okay. Thank you.

1658
01:13:24.008 --> 01:13:25.966
Thank... Thank. thank you.
thank you so much. Thank you.

Are you my...

1688
01:15:25.695 --> 01:15:26.826
No.

1689
01:15:28.262 --> 01:15:29.612
But I'm glad
to finally meet you.

1690
01:15:31.657 --> 01:15:34.051
We were only married
a few years before
she fell sick.

1691
01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:35.705
I'm so sorry.

1692
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:38.838
They were good years.

1693
01:15:38.969 --> 01:15:41.014
We never had
kids of our own though.

1694
01:15:41.145 --> 01:15:42.755
I'm very sorry
I wasn't able to introduce you

1695
01:15:42.886 --> 01:15:44.235
to a little brother
or sister today.

1696
01:15:44.365 --> 01:15:46.629
It's okay.

1697
01:15:46.759 --> 01:15:48.544
She always talked
about you though.

1698
01:15:50.197 --> 01:15:51.242
You know.
she was just a teenager

1699
01:15:51.372 --> 01:15:52.548
when she got pregnant.

1700
01:15:54.201 --> 01:15:56.856
Her boyfriend didn't
want to get in trouble.

1701
01:15:56.987 --> 01:15:58.510
and he denied it.

1702
01:15:58.641 --> 01:16:01.208
So. her parents sent her to
China until you were born.

1703
01:16:03.515 --> 01:16:05.691
They're the ones who forced
her to give you up.

1704
01:16:05.822 --> 01:16:07.563
But she never stopped
thinking about you.

1705
01:16:10.435 --> 01:16:13.569
If I tried to find her sooner

1706
01:16:14.308 --> 01:16:15.919
maybe she and I could...

1707
01:16:20.706 --> 01:16:21.838
But it's too late.

1708
01:16:21.968 --> 01:16:23.317
There's something
you should see.

1709
01:16:25.319 --> 01:16:28.584
When she got sick.
she wanted to throw a party.

1710
01:16:30.107 --> 01:16:31.891
So. we rented a boat

1711
01:16:32.022 --> 01:16:34.590
and we sailed out
to Yeouido Park.

1712
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.853
Uh. that's right along
the Han River.

1713
01:16:36.983 --> 01:16:38.594
Several of us got seasick

1714
01:16:38.724 --> 01:16:39.986
- on the way...

1715
01:16:40.117 --> 01:16:41.814
...which she thought
was pretty hilarious.

1716
01:16:43.642 --> 01:16:46.819
But it was beautiful.

1717
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:48.995
She got to say goodbye
to everybody she loved.

1718
01:16:51.694 --> 01:16:52.651
Except for you.

1719
01:16:55.741 --> 01:16:57.134
So she made you this.

1720
01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:16.544
<i>Hi. I'm Min.</i>

1721
01:17:18.068 --> 01:17:20.157
<i>Sorry. my English is not good.</i>

1722
01:17:20.287 --> 01:17:21.419
<i>What are you
talking about?</i>

1723
01:17:21.549 --> 01:17:22.942
<i>Your English is very good.</i>

1724
01:17:25.249 --> 01:17:26.816
<i>I am sorry</i>

1725
01:17:26.946 --> 01:17:29.645
<i>I could not be
part of your life.</i>

1726
01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:33.083
<i>I want to very much.</i>

1727
01:17:34.345 --> 01:17:35.868
<i>But when you were baby.</i>

1728
01:17:36.042 --> 01:17:38.479
<i>you smile so big.</i>

1729
01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:41.613
<i>And you cry so big.</i>

1730
01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:47.575
<i>I wonder what
you are like now.</i>

1731
01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:51.014
<i>Are you doctor?</i>

1732
01:17:51.188 --> 01:17:53.233
<i>- Lawyer? Teacher?</i>

1733
01:17:56.541 --> 01:17:58.717
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

1734
01:17:58.848 --> 01:18:01.154
<i>I'm proud to be your mother.</i>

1735
01:18:01.285 --> 01:18:02.634
<i>It doesn't matter?</i>

1736
01:18:02.765 --> 01:18:04.244
<i>- That's not what you told me.</i>

1737
01:18:08.553 --> 01:18:13.166
<i>I hope
this message find you.</i>

1738
01:18:14.298 --> 01:18:15.734
<i>And...</i>

1739
01:18:26.832 --> 01:18:28.094
<i>My daughter...</i>

1740
01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:30.706
<i>I love you.</i>

1741
01:18:43.806 --> 01:18:44.850
I'm sorry.

1742
01:19:02.694 --> 01:19:05.305
Well. glad we got a chance
to spend some time together.

1743
01:19:05.436 --> 01:19:06.829
Me. too.

1744
01:19:06.959 --> 01:19:08.831
Really have to go so soon?

1745
01:19:08.961 --> 01:19:11.007
Yeah. but I'll be back.

1746
01:19:11.137 --> 01:19:12.660
Um...

1747
01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:15.228
Thank you so much again
for everything.

1748
01:19:15.359 --> 01:19:17.230
And honestly.
I'm just so lucky that you

1749
01:19:17.361 --> 01:19:18.841
happen to be
at her grave that day.

1750
01:19:18.971 --> 01:19:22.627
Well. I appreciate that.
but. uh. it wasn't quite luck.

1751
01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:25.282
Your friends messaged me.

1752
01:19:25.412 --> 01:19:26.936
Uh...

1753
01:19:27.066 --> 01:19:29.808
Lolo. Kat. and... I know
I'm gonna get this one wrong.

1754
01:19:29.939 --> 01:19:31.331
Uh. Deadeye?

1755
01:19:33.159 --> 01:19:35.292
Yeah. Oh. um...

1756
01:19:35.422 --> 01:19:37.207
Yeah. my... My parents
must've told them.

1757
01:19:37.337 --> 01:19:39.818
Yeah. they told me that
you were actually in Korea

1758
01:19:39.949 --> 01:19:42.168
and that I might find you
if I went to the graveyard.

1759
01:19:42.299 --> 01:19:43.474
They didn't tell you
any of this. did they?

1760
01:19:43.604 --> 01:19:45.389
Oh. no. We. um...

1761
01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:47.783
It's just. we got into
a little bit of a fight.

1762
01:19:47.913 --> 01:19:49.219
And. uh. I...

1763
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:53.266
I lost my job
and I said some...

1764
01:19:53.397 --> 01:19:55.791
really terrible things
to all of them and. uh...

1765
01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:58.228
It may not be
any of my business.

1766
01:19:59.533 --> 01:20:02.058
but it seems to me that
what matters the most

1767
01:20:02.188 --> 01:20:04.277
is if your friends love
you enough to forgive you.

1768
01:20:04.408 --> 01:20:06.802
- Well...
- And if they went through
all this trouble.

1769
01:20:07.715 --> 01:20:08.716
I think they would.

1770
01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.241
Where are they now?

1771
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:46.319
Hey. Kat.

1772
01:20:51.368 --> 01:20:54.458
Listen. I... I'm sorry about
everything that happened. I...

1773
01:20:54.588 --> 01:20:57.243
No. No.
No. no. no. no. no. I...

1774
01:20:57.374 --> 01:20:58.984
I listened to your voicemail.

1775
01:20:59.115 --> 01:21:02.858
The whole three hours of it.

1776
01:21:03.946 --> 01:21:05.686
I appreciate the honesty.

1777
01:21:05.817 --> 01:21:08.341
Truth of it is.
I kind of figured

1778
01:21:08.472 --> 01:21:10.953
that you'd had sex before.

1779
01:21:11.083 --> 01:21:13.999
You know. you're just
so sensual. and worldly

1780
01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:16.828
and one time I saw your
browser history and...

1781
01:21:16.959 --> 01:21:18.917
It's not like I didn't
wanna have sex.

1782
01:21:19.048 --> 01:21:20.745
I was just so worried

1783
01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:22.878
that I wouldn't live up
to your expectations.

1784
01:21:23.008 --> 01:21:24.792
And then
when I saw your tattoo.

1785
01:21:24.923 --> 01:21:28.100
I just got
crazy intimidated and...

1786
01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:29.493
Look. Kat. when we kiss.

1787
01:21:29.623 --> 01:21:31.364
I have to leave
space for Jesus.

1788
01:21:31.495 --> 01:21:32.844
I gotta leave that God gap

1789
01:21:32.975 --> 01:21:35.281
because I'm gonna
ruin my pants.

1790
01:21:35.412 --> 01:21:36.717
Every time.

1791
01:21:36.848 --> 01:21:38.241
That's why I wear
three pairs of underwear.

1792
01:21:38.371 --> 01:21:41.244
Oh. honey. I love you so much

1793
01:21:41.374 --> 01:21:43.811
that I gave up the thing
I love second most for you.

1794
01:21:43.942 --> 01:21:46.771
- And I love dick.

1795
01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:48.904
I can be dick.

1796
01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:51.428
And I can love you.
I can do both.

1797
01:21:51.558 --> 01:21:53.082
So. should we have sex
right now?

1798
01:21:53.212 --> 01:21:55.693
- Ah. Ooh. Ooh. Oh.
- Ah. Oh. oh. oh. oh. oh.

1799
01:21:55.823 --> 01:21:57.216
what's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening?

1800
01:21:57.347 --> 01:21:58.696
Ha... Save... No...

1801
01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:02.178
Saved it.

1802
01:22:02.308 --> 01:22:03.266
- Saved it.
- Mmm.

1803
01:22:09.185 --> 01:22:10.142
Thanks. Jin Ho.

1804
01:22:10.273 --> 01:22:11.578
Heard you got into med school.

1805
01:22:12.101 --> 01:22:13.058
So proud.

1806
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:15.452
Here you go. Hot and steamy.

1807
01:22:15.582 --> 01:22:16.757
Let me know
if you want hot sauce.

1808
01:22:16.888 --> 01:22:18.194
I'll get you the Chinese kind.

1809
01:22:18.324 --> 01:22:19.456
Pretty sure you can handle it.

1810
01:22:26.028 --> 01:22:27.855
- Hi.
- You had me at "Hi."

1811
01:22:27.986 --> 01:22:29.161
Oh.

1812
01:22:29.292 --> 01:22:31.076
Hi.

1813
01:22:31.207 --> 01:22:32.599
I didn't know
you worked here now.

1814
01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:34.514
I don't. I'm just covering
'cause Jing's out sick.

1815
01:22:34.645 --> 01:22:36.386
I'm trying to match her vibe.
What do you think?

1816
01:22:37.604 --> 01:22:40.042
Number 32!
Number 32!

1817
01:22:40.172 --> 01:22:41.608
Party of two!

1818
01:22:42.827 --> 01:22:45.003
Yeah. that's good.

1819
01:22:49.268 --> 01:22:51.749
- Lolo.
- Sorry. I'm so sorry. Um...

1820
01:22:51.879 --> 01:22:53.272
She doesn't wanna talk to you.

1821
01:22:53.403 --> 01:22:55.318
Yeah. I figured
when I left her. like.

1822
01:22:55.448 --> 01:22:57.450
ten messages and she didn't
call me back.

1823
01:22:58.277 --> 01:22:59.975
Sorry.

1824
01:23:00.105 --> 01:23:02.020
Family first. Have to do it.
Respectfully. of course.

1825
01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:05.284
Yeah. no. I know. I know.

1826
01:23:05.415 --> 01:23:07.808
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you. too.

1827
01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:10.376
Lolo! Lolo!
No. no. no. Lolo! Stop.

1828
01:23:10.507 --> 01:23:12.900
No. no. no. Hey! Hey!
Break! Break! Stop!

1829
01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:14.119
- Sorry. I'm so sorry.

1830
01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:15.338
Sorry. everyone.

1831
01:23:15.468 --> 01:23:16.861
Enjoy your meal.

1832
01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:20.299
Um. it's. it's just that
everything's a mess

1833
01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:21.518
and it's all my fault.

1834
01:23:22.432 --> 01:23:23.694
Ever since we were kids.

1835
01:23:23.824 --> 01:23:26.436
I was this scared little girl

1836
01:23:26.566 --> 01:23:30.788
who always felt like she had
to prove herself to everyone

1837
01:23:31.832 --> 01:23:32.833
except for you.

1838
01:23:34.313 --> 01:23:37.012
You were always
looking out for me.

1839
01:23:37.186 --> 01:23:41.973
<i>With you was the only time
I felt safe to be me.</i>

1840
01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:46.630
Even though I didn't know
who the hell I was.

1841
01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:49.459
But you've always been
comfortable being you.

1842
01:23:49.589 --> 01:23:52.070
<i>And you tried to make me feel
that way too.</i>

1843
01:23:52.201 --> 01:23:54.681
You know me better
than I know myself.

1844
01:23:58.076 --> 01:23:59.077
I...

1845
01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:05.388
You were right. I hated
working at that law firm.

1846
01:24:05.518 --> 01:24:09.348
But... Thanks to you. I can do
something more meaningful.

1847
01:24:10.784 --> 01:24:12.917
Start my own practice.

1848
01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:15.398
Because I know that
I'm brave enough now.

1849
01:24:15.528 --> 01:24:16.747
Hell yeah.

1850
01:24:16.877 --> 01:24:18.357
She had a devil's threesome
in China.

1851
01:24:18.488 --> 01:24:19.706
Huh? What?

1852
01:24:19.837 --> 01:24:21.056
-  I did.

1853
01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:24.059
Lolo. it's so great

1854
01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:25.147
that you are working here.

1855
01:24:25.277 --> 01:24:26.409
And I'm so proud
of you for that

1856
01:24:27.801 --> 01:24:30.717
but you are an incredible.
true artist.

1857
01:24:30.848 --> 01:24:32.719
You cannot give that up
just because

1858
01:24:32.850 --> 01:24:38.899
I am a lying. hurtful.
stupid failure of a friend.

1859
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:41.076
Audrey. I haven't given up. Look.

1860
01:24:42.599 --> 01:24:44.601
My wall of licky cats.

1861
01:24:44.731 --> 01:24:46.342
I just sold one yesterday.

1862
01:24:46.472 --> 01:24:49.258
I'm only waiting tables
for now so I'm not
such a barnacle.

1863
01:24:49.388 --> 01:24:51.303
You've always been
a better friend to me

1864
01:24:51.434 --> 01:24:54.219
than I have been to you.
And I'm so. so sorry.

1865
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:56.743
Just shut up. Okay?

1866
01:25:00.269 --> 01:25:02.097
You're the best friend
I could ever ask for.

1867
01:25:02.227 --> 01:25:03.663
The biggest support system.

1868
01:25:03.794 --> 01:25:05.926
And I'm sorry. I'm the one
that's fuckin' sorry.

1869
01:25:06.057 --> 01:25:07.145
I took you for granted.

1870
01:25:10.496 --> 01:25:13.151
So. does that mean
you forgive me?

1871
01:25:14.544 --> 01:25:15.806
Come here. bitch.

1872
01:25:20.289 --> 01:25:21.246
Friendship.

1873
01:25:21.942 --> 01:25:23.683
Party of three?

1874
01:25:23.814 --> 01:25:25.294
Oh. my God. Get in here.

1875
01:25:25.424 --> 01:25:27.034
Deadeye.

1876
01:25:27.165 --> 01:25:28.819
We're back. baby!

1877
01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:30.821
Wait. are we all back?

1878
01:25:30.951 --> 01:25:32.605
Have you and Kat
started talkin' again?

1879
01:25:32.736 --> 01:25:34.129
Yeah. I called her to apologize.

1880
01:25:34.259 --> 01:25:36.827
But wait. does that mean
you and Kat were talking?

1881
01:25:37.523 --> 01:25:38.655
We've been in touch.

1882
01:25:38.785 --> 01:25:40.265
- We're like this.
Mmm.

1883
01:25:40.396 --> 01:25:41.745
So. we should all go on
a trip again. the four of us.

1884
01:25:41.875 --> 01:25:45.488
To beautiful South Dakota.
Home of the Corn Palace.

1885
01:25:45.618 --> 01:25:48.665
Yeah.
- Bookmark it.

1886
01:25:48.795 --> 01:25:50.362
Kat and I actually
had a place in mind.

1887
01:26:00.067 --> 01:26:01.373
<i>Bonjour!</i>

1888
01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:08.728
Look at us! Look at us!

1889
01:26:08.859 --> 01:26:11.601
Our second
annual best friends trip.

1890
01:26:11.731 --> 01:26:13.168
This is gonna be iconic.

1891
01:26:13.298 --> 01:26:14.995
Let's start with some
art and culture.

1892
01:26:15.126 --> 01:26:16.736
Oh. I love Roldan.

1893
01:26:16.867 --> 01:26:18.477
I gotta say. the French
know how to sculpt a titty.

1894
01:26:18.608 --> 01:26:19.826
I love art.

1895
01:26:19.957 --> 01:26:20.914
Oh. that's gonna be
so much fun.

1896
01:26:21.045 --> 01:26:22.177
Art. Art. Art.

1897
01:26:25.963 --> 01:26:26.920
So. is anyone hungry?

1898
01:26:27.051 --> 01:26:28.400
- Yes. Please.
- I am.

1899
01:26:28.531 --> 01:26:29.836
I want to try escargot.

1900
01:26:29.967 --> 01:26:32.665
You know. we don't
have to eat French food.

1901
01:26:32.796 --> 01:26:35.494
- This is so good.
I love this bulgogi.

1902
01:26:35.625 --> 01:26:37.148
Mmm.
Mmm.

1903
01:26:37.279 --> 01:26:39.324
Okay. okay. A toast.

1904
01:26:39.455 --> 01:26:41.500
To Audrey. Badass boss bitch

1905
01:26:41.631 --> 01:26:43.589
- starting her own firm.
- Yes. she is!

1906
01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.330
To our dearest Deadeye.

1907
01:26:45.461 --> 01:26:47.289
Because they host the most
incredible game night

1908
01:26:47.419 --> 01:26:48.986
specifically so I can
crush them at Catan.

1909
01:26:49.116 --> 01:26:51.031
- And to Kat

1910
01:26:51.162 --> 01:26:54.687
who's in a movie
directed by the Greta Gerwig.

1911
01:26:54.818 --> 01:26:56.776
- Yes. she is!

1912
01:26:56.907 --> 01:26:59.823
Okay. And to our very own
Frida Kah-Lolo...

1913
01:26:59.953 --> 01:27:01.390
- Aw.

1914
01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:03.740
...whose lotus collection
is finally at the MOCA.

1915
01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:05.655
Well. it's not the Museum of
Contemporary Arts

1916
01:27:05.785 --> 01:27:08.788
but it is a cafe in Snohomish.
So <i>ganbei</i> to that.

1917
01:27:08.919 --> 01:27:10.921
<i>Ganbei!</i>

1918
01:27:11.051 --> 01:27:13.140
Mmm.
- I don't wanna hijack

1919
01:27:13.271 --> 01:27:16.927
our second annual
best friends trip

1920
01:27:17.057 --> 01:27:19.146
but Clar-Bear and I looking at
fall dates for the wedding

1921
01:27:19.277 --> 01:27:21.279
and I was just wondering...

1922
01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:23.890
will you all be
my bridal party?

1923
01:27:24.021 --> 01:27:25.152
Really? Of course.
- Of course. we will.

1924
01:27:25.283 --> 01:27:26.850
Duh!
Ooh!

1925
01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:29.505
The bridal party should all get
matching tattoos like Kat.

1926
01:27:29.635 --> 01:27:30.984
Okay. very funny.

1927
01:27:31.115 --> 01:27:32.421
- Very funny. Ha-ha.

1928
01:27:32.551 --> 01:27:33.987
<i>Ganbei!</i>

1929
01:27:34.945 --> 01:27:36.425
Mmm.

1930
01:27:36.555 --> 01:27:38.731
Mmm. Or we could get a tattoo
of the Chinese flag

1931
01:27:38.862 --> 01:27:40.472
to commemorate the motherland.

1932
01:27:40.603 --> 01:27:42.474
Or Princess Peach.
I haven't decided.

1933
01:27:42.605 --> 01:27:44.346
I think I'm gonna get
an Eiffel Tower.

1934
01:27:44.476 --> 01:27:46.783
Because Paris?
No. the...

1935
01:27:46.913 --> 01:27:48.306
Hmm. Yeah.

1936
01:27:48.437 --> 01:27:50.090
Yeah. like you all are
gonna get tattoos.

1937
01:27:50.221 --> 01:27:51.570
<i>What if I already got one?</i>

1938
01:27:53.442 --> 01:27:54.660
I already got one.

1939
01:27:54.791 --> 01:27:55.835
You did not.
What?

1940
01:27:55.966 --> 01:27:56.967
Wanna see?

1941
01:28:02.973 --> 01:28:03.974
It lights up.

1942
01:28:04.409 --> 01:28:05.541
