179
00:08:37.317 --> 00:08:40.153
After-song snackies!

180
00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:44.825
<i>♪ Oh. from the tuna
to the piranha ♪</i>

181
00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.794
<i>♪ Everyfishy's gonna see ♪</i>

182
00:08:46.794 --> 00:08:48.696
<i>♪ Everything's about me ♪</i>

183
00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:55.168
<i>♪ Stariana-na-na-na.
na-na-na-na-na-na ♪</i>

184
00:08:55.168 --> 00:08:57.871
Hey. there's that
Stariana music video again.

185
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.608
Wow. that song is everywhere.

186
00:09:00.608 --> 00:09:02.676
Kinda repetitive if you ask me.

187
00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:04.111
It's like it's
turning everyfishy

188
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.846
into mindless zombiefish.

189
00:09:05.846 --> 00:09:10.183
It has been stuck in my head
for a disturbingly long time.

190
00:09:10.183 --> 00:09:11.785
but I like it.

191
00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:14.521
And actually. I'm watching
this for research.

192
00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:15.956
Research?

193
00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:18.158
Why are you
researching Stariana?

194
00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:20.027
I knew it. Mrs. Shark!

195
00:09:20.027 --> 00:09:23.664
You're leading a secret
life as a pop star!

196
00:09:23.664 --> 00:09:26.233
And you kept this from me?

197
00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:28.368
I could have helped
pick your outfits!

198
00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:30.070
No. squiddo.

199
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.873
But there is
something important

200
00:09:32.873 --> 00:09:35.042
we need to talk to you about.

201
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.179
Oh. uh. that's my alarm!

202
00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:40.814
That's your alarm?

203
00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:43.083
Yes. Grandpa.
which means we have to go.

204
00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:47.087
We have got to get
you a better alarm.

205
00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.056
Should I leave?

206
00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:50.123
No way.

207
00:09:50.123 --> 00:09:51.659
Anything you need
to say to me.

208
00:09:51.659 --> 00:09:53.193
you can say
in front of William.

209
00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:55.663
Plus. we still
need our snackies.

210
00:09:55.663 --> 00:10:00.000
Well. I just got
some fin-tastic news.

211
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.937
Baby. William. you're
looking at Chomp City's

212
00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.106
new entertainment director!

213
00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.275
Whoa!

214
00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:10.010
Wait. what is that?

215
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.345
It's like being a party
planner for the whole city.

216
00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:14.014
both: Jaw-some!

217
00:10:14.014 --> 00:10:18.285
Yup. your mom is going to
be overseeing all of Chomp

218
00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:19.820
City's musical events.

219
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.790
Starting with
the Chomp City Chomptacular.

220
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.992
which Stariana is headlining.

221
00:10:24.992 --> 00:10:28.528
She called me herself to offer
me the position. no big deal.

222
00:10:28.528 --> 00:10:30.430
The Chomptacular?

223
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.865
That's the concert of the year!

224
00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:33.734
Everyfishy's gonna be there.

225
00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:35.602
Sharki B. Bad Bunnyslug--

226
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.472
And ENHYPEN!

227
00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.108
Ahh...

228
00:10:41.108 --> 00:10:42.509
ah.

229
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:46.013
You get to meet ENHYPEN?

230
00:10:46.013 --> 00:10:47.314
- Oh. yeah!
- * Uh-huh! ♪

231
00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:49.049
- Go Mommy!
- * I'll tell you ♪

232
00:10:49.049 --> 00:10:50.350
Go Mommy!

233
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.120
So the Sharks are
moving to Chomp City!

234
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.689
- Whoo-hoo--ooh?
- Wait. what?

235
00:10:55.689 --> 00:10:57.791
We're moving?

236
00:10:57.791 --> 00:11:01.061
Mrs. Shark.
unfortunately you can't move.

237
00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:03.731
That would mean Baby would
miss my birthday party.

238
00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:05.332
Yeah!

239
00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:06.834
We can't move!

240
00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:09.469
We know
it's not perfect timing.

241
00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:11.004
Wha--

242
00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:14.842
so we're not going
to be neighbors anymore?

243
00:11:14.842 --> 00:11:17.110
I know it's
a big change. Baby.

244
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.212
But you two can still
visit each other.

245
00:11:19.212 --> 00:11:23.250
But Chomp City's all the way
across the whole wide water.

246
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.187
How about those snackies?

247
00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:32.993
Thanks. but I
think I lost my appetite.

248
00:11:32.993 --> 00:11:34.795
I better flow home.

249
00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:37.297
Oh.

250
00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:49.042
Well. the dental office
is officially closed.

251
00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.644
and I'm ready
for a city adventure!

252
00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:52.980
Just think. Baby!

253
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.015
It'll be a dream come true.

254
00:11:55.015 --> 00:12:00.120
You can even get your teeth
cleaned by the Dr. Sawtooth.

255
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.689
Ironically. she's famous
for her gentle touch.

256
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.793
Uh. Daddy. that's your dream.

257
00:12:05.793 --> 00:12:08.461
Oh. hehe. right.

258
00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:09.863
I know!

259
00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:12.099
What if--
and hear me out here--

260
00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:14.802
I stay behind
with Grandma and Grandpa!

261
00:12:14.802 --> 00:12:16.203
- Oh!

262
00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:17.871
Then I could help
if Grandpa gets a cramp

263
00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:19.406
and needs his fin cream!

264
00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.708
Or Grandma needs the Wi-Fi
password for her tablet!

265
00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:23.844
Or they both get
cold and no fishies

266
00:12:23.844 --> 00:12:25.112
here to knit them a scarf!

267
00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:26.880
Ooh. that sounds great.

268
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.648
I do get cold
from time to time.

269
00:12:28.648 --> 00:12:30.884
Oof!

270
00:12:30.884 --> 00:12:32.585
You don't want
to stay with us. squiddo.

271
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.355
Yeah. we're just going
to be sitting around telling

272
00:12:35.355 --> 00:12:37.825
each other long embellished
stories about our pasts

273
00:12:37.825 --> 00:12:40.060
that we've already
heard 300 times.

274
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.595
Luckily.
I always forget them.

275
00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:45.732
C'mon. Baby.

276
00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.901
Chomp City will be great.

277
00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:49.302
And while we get
up on our fins.

278
00:12:49.302 --> 00:12:51.839
we'll get to stay
with my old friend Leah.

279
00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:54.107
Remember how much fun she is?

280
00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:57.444
Plus. you'll finally get
to meet her little pup Lannie.

281
00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:59.279
Leah Lanternshark?

282
00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.850
Hey. weren't you two in
a yacht rock group together?

283
00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:08.889
I try not to remember that.

284
00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:10.157
That's right!

285
00:13:10.157 --> 00:13:12.860
She was kicked out
for being too smooth.

286
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.727
How's she doing?

287
00:13:14.862 --> 00:13:18.531
Oh. she's--well. actually.
I don't really know.

288
00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:20.500
It's been a while
since we caught up.

289
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.036
So I guess we'll find
out and hopefully

290
00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:25.005
live to tell the tale. ha.

291
00:13:25.005 --> 00:13:26.439
It's no fair.

292
00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:28.708
I have to move away
from my best friend.

293
00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:31.044
and you get to live with yours.

294
00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:33.180
Try to think of it
as a new adventure.

295
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.681
An adventure?

296
00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:36.049
Without William?

297
00:13:36.049 --> 00:13:37.784
Well. that's like
a shark without water.

298
00:13:37.885 --> 00:13:41.054
What if William makes a new
best friend while I'm gone?

299
00:13:41.054 --> 00:13:43.891
And they make new inside jokes?

300
00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:45.893
That I'm outside of!

301
00:13:45.893 --> 00:13:48.896
I'll be outside the jokes!

302
00:13:54.902 --> 00:13:56.636
Don't worry. squiddo.

303
00:13:56.636 --> 00:14:01.241
At my age. I found that true
blue fin-ship conquers all.

304
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:04.544
Even a move across
the whole wide water.

305
00:14:06.914 --> 00:14:09.549
♪ Packing up
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo ♪

306
00:14:09.549 --> 00:14:11.384
♪ All my stuff

307
00:14:11.384 --> 00:14:13.653

309
00:14:14.955 --> 00:14:17.157
Somefishy's in a good mood.

310
00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:18.926
Good mood?
Ha!

311
00:14:18.926 --> 00:14:20.327
Try great mood!

312
00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:22.129
Because of how
great everything is!

313
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:23.496
Great!

314
00:14:23.496 --> 00:14:25.298
I'm so glad you're excited.

315
00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:27.935
And remember. only pack
the things you need.

316
00:14:27.935 --> 00:14:29.569
Oh. I am.

317
00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:30.637
Oof!

318
00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.943
Baby.

319
00:14:35.943 --> 00:14:36.977
What?

320
00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:38.411
He needs his best friend!

321
00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:41.781
- Yeah!
- Nice try. squiddos.

322
00:14:41.781 --> 00:14:45.152
I can't believe
you're really leaving.

323
00:14:45.152 --> 00:14:46.954
Me neither.

324
00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:49.056
But are you and I
the best friends

325
00:14:49.056 --> 00:14:53.260
in the whole wide water
gonna let that get us down?

326
00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.128
So I'm moving across
the seven seas.

327
00:14:55.128 --> 00:14:56.529
So what?

328
00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:59.866
A fin-ship like ours
is bigger than that!

329
00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:02.135
We took a vow. remember?

330
00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:03.470
Through thick and fin?

331
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.007
Yeah!
In salt and fresh water.

332
00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:09.142
I'll always be by your side.

333
00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:10.310
Always!

334
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.645
Mm. what was that?

335
00:15:14.214 --> 00:15:16.984
Er. at least symbolically.

336
00:15:16.984 --> 00:15:18.385
Here--

337
00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:20.420
Much better.

338
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:26.126
Thanks for the moving
help. Mail Whale!

339
00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:27.995
You're welcome.

340
00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:31.198
Hooo-hooo-hoohoooo-hoo-hooo.

341
00:15:31.198 --> 00:15:35.502
Grandma. Grandpa.
I'll miss you.

342
00:15:35.502 --> 00:15:37.870
Oh. have fun. lil pup.

343
00:15:38.005 --> 00:15:41.008
It's sure going to be
a snooze fest around here

344
00:15:41.008 --> 00:15:42.875
without ya.

345
00:15:48.248 --> 00:15:50.450
Guess this is it. huh?

346
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.652
Nope. not nearly.

347
00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:55.155
Because I have
a surprise for you--

348
00:15:55.155 --> 00:15:57.024
happy early birthday!

349
00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:02.229
Two tickets
to the Chomptacular!

350
00:16:02.229 --> 00:16:03.830
How?

351
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.599
Let's just say
I know a shark.

352
00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:09.036
It's me. I'm the shark.

353
00:16:09.036 --> 00:16:11.771
William. when you come
visit me in Chomp City.

354
00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:15.042
we're going to be
front row for ENHYPEN!

355
00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:16.876
Front row?

356
00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:20.713
You think we'll get
to dance on stage with them?

357
00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:24.151
Um. obviously we'll get
to dance on stage with them.

358
00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:26.619
Aww. thank you. Baby.

359
00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:30.590
This is the jaw-somest
birthday present ever.

360
00:16:34.394 --> 00:16:37.064

- Bye. everyfishy!
- Bye. Baby!

367
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.334
Goodbye!

368
00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:15.835
Oh. take care.

369
00:17:15.835 --> 00:17:18.405
What time is it?

370
00:17:18.405 --> 00:17:21.541
Party time.

371
00:17:27.614 --> 00:17:29.282
Chin up. lil pup.

372
00:17:29.282 --> 00:17:31.017
Everything will be fine.

373
00:17:31.118 --> 00:17:32.619
You'll see.

374
00:17:32.619 --> 00:17:36.589
All right. I just downloaded
this new app called Waterways.

375
00:17:36.589 --> 00:17:40.026
It'll get us there in
two shakes of a tail-fin!

376
00:17:40.127 --> 00:17:42.195
Whoo!

377
00:17:51.138 --> 00:17:55.242
Uh. that way!

378
00:17:55.242 --> 00:17:57.177
OK. maybe the other way!

379
00:18:01.248 --> 00:18:03.049
This can't be right.

380
00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:08.655
Ah! Neither can this!

381
00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:11.191
Look!

382
00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:13.393
Up ahead.

383
00:18:13.393 --> 00:18:14.994
Wow.

384
00:18:14.994 --> 00:18:17.164
Chomp City.

385
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:46.193
Whew!

386
00:18:46.193 --> 00:18:47.860
We made it.

387
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.902
Whoa.

388
00:18:59.506 --> 00:19:01.341
Wow. the sights.

389
00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:02.375
The sounds.

390
00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:03.343
The smells.

391
00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:10.817
City life. we're living it!

392
00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:12.219
- Hey.
- Pardon me!

393
00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:14.521
Whoop!
- Ey. I'm swimmin' here!

394
00:19:14.521 --> 00:19:16.289
Oof!

395
00:19:20.227 --> 00:19:24.964
Nothing a little
Baby Shark charm can't fix.

396
00:19:24.964 --> 00:19:29.336
I am truly. deeply sorry.

397
00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:32.839
Those puppy shark
eyes aren't going to cut

398
00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:35.074
it in Chomp City. squiddo.

399
00:19:38.745 --> 00:19:41.281
So I'm a
little out of my depth.

400
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:42.482
Mommy. Daddy!

401
00:19:42.482 --> 00:19:44.951
Wait for me!

402
00:19:44.951 --> 00:19:46.619
How's my smile?

403
00:19:46.619 --> 00:19:49.989
Hmm. Abso-toothly perfect!

404
00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:54.861
Hmm. ugh. did Leah
forget we're coming today?

405
00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.729
Where are they?

406
00:19:58.265 --> 00:20:00.267
Right here!

407
00:20:00.267 --> 00:20:01.334
There she is!

408
00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:03.135
Long time. no hug!

409
00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:04.103
Leah!

410
00:20:04.103 --> 00:20:07.139
So small but so strong.

411
00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:10.543
I see you still
know how to make an entrance.

412
00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:13.179
Hi. Lannie.

413
00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:16.283
Gerald. you troublemaker.

414
00:20:16.283 --> 00:20:18.318
Hey. girl. hey!

415
00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:19.486
You remember this.

416
00:20:19.486 --> 00:20:21.020
Up high. down low!

417
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.890
To the right. let it flow!

418
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.061
And you!

419
00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.030
Come to Auntie Leah!

420
00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.865
Huh. didn't think
he called you "Auntie."

421
00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:34.233
He does now!

422
00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.369
Let Auntie Leah do
the shark check.

423
00:20:37.937 --> 00:20:39.839
Dorsal fin. check.

424
00:20:41.641 --> 00:20:43.343
Star mark. check.

425
00:20:44.844 --> 00:20:48.415
Tail--perfectly springy.

426
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.754
Now it's about
time you two met.

427
00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:57.590
Baby. this is
my little pup Lannie!

428
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.359
Uh. hi. Lannie!

429
00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:00.593
I'm Baby Shark.

430
00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.429
I know!
I mean. nice to eat you.

431
00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:03.863
Gah!

432
00:21:03.863 --> 00:21:06.433
I mean. nice to meet you. Yeah.

433
00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:08.735
Nice to meet you. too.

434
00:21:08.735 --> 00:21:10.036
I like your colors.

435
00:21:10.036 --> 00:21:11.838
We're lantern sharks.
so we glow!

436
00:21:11.838 --> 00:21:13.540
See? Angry!

437
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.575
Happy!
Hungry.

438
00:21:15.575 --> 00:21:18.345
I guess you could say.
I wear my heart on my sleeve.

439
00:21:18.345 --> 00:21:21.814
Except. I don't have sleeves.
so you wouldn't say that.

440
00:21:21.814 --> 00:21:24.250
Get it together. Lannie.
Lock it down!

441
00:21:24.351 --> 00:21:27.720
No. no. that's very cool.

442
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.221
Whaddaya say?

443
00:21:29.356 --> 00:21:31.424
Ready to dive in
and explore your new home?

444
00:21:31.424 --> 00:21:32.592
I guess so.

445
00:21:32.592 --> 00:21:34.060
You guess so?

446
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.528
Nah. nah. nah. we gotta
do better than that.

447
00:21:35.528 --> 00:21:37.764

Your new home.

499
00:23:24.904 --> 00:23:28.841
We definitely aren't
in Carnivore Cove anymore.

500
00:23:30.977 --> 00:23:32.144
This way!

501
00:23:32.144 --> 00:23:33.680
I'll show you our room.

502
00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.981
"Our" room?

503
00:23:34.981 --> 00:23:37.049
Look. I understand
Dr. Sawtooth is busy.

504
00:23:37.049 --> 00:23:40.720
but could she make an exception
for a fellow practitioner

505
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.021
of the dental arts?

506
00:23:42.021 --> 00:23:45.592
Look at you. Mommy Shark.
back in the city.

507
00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:47.627
Wow. ya know.
it's been way too long.

508
00:23:47.627 --> 00:23:50.630
Yeah. I've been meaning
to visit. but you know.

509
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.865
life always seems
to get in the way.

510
00:23:52.865 --> 00:23:55.167
Ugh. That pesky life.

511
00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:58.337
Well. catch-up time starts now.

512
00:23:58.337 --> 00:23:59.539
Totally.

513
00:23:59.539 --> 00:24:02.542
Let the catching up begin.

514
00:24:02.542 --> 00:24:04.210
- Yes!

515
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:05.344
Oh. thank you!

516
00:24:05.344 --> 00:24:06.779
I'll take it!

517
00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:07.747
Mwah.

518
00:24:07.747 --> 00:24:09.916
Daddy's going to the dentist!

519
00:24:09.916 --> 00:24:11.818
Whoo--ah!

520
00:24:11.818 --> 00:24:13.986
That hurt!

521
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.192
This is my bed.
and this one's yours!

522
00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:23.696
Unless you want mine. in which
case you can totally have it.

523
00:24:23.696 --> 00:24:24.997
Oh. that's OK.

524
00:24:24.997 --> 00:24:27.166
Thanks. though.

525
00:24:27.166 --> 00:24:28.601
OK. but the offer stands.

526
00:24:28.601 --> 00:24:30.537
Anything for my new best bud!

527
00:24:30.537 --> 00:24:34.306
Uh. I kinda already
have a best. best bud.

528
00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:36.342
But we can still be friends!

529
00:24:36.342 --> 00:24:37.744
Totally!

530
00:24:37.744 --> 00:24:40.346
Well. this is still
going to be jaw-some.

531
00:24:40.346 --> 00:24:42.414
It's like a forever sleepover!

532
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:44.216
Just a warning--my mom
says I talk in my sleep.

533
00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:46.719
But I've never heard it. so--

534
00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:58.765
One day down. forever to go.

535
00:25:12.378 --> 00:25:14.080
But I'm just an understudy!

536
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.682
- Huh?
- What?

537
00:25:15.682 --> 00:25:16.949
Me?

538
00:25:16.949 --> 00:25:19.451
Star in the off-off
Broadwave production

539
00:25:19.586 --> 00:25:21.854
of "Les Fisherables" tonight?

540
00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:26.926
♪ La la la la la
la la la ♪

541
00:25:36.903 --> 00:25:39.338
Ah!

542
00:25:39.338 --> 00:25:42.742
The Chomptacular.

543
00:25:42.742 --> 00:25:45.812
It's a beautiful day. Gillie.

544
00:25:45.812 --> 00:25:49.916
Have I ever told you how
much I appreciate you?

545
00:25:49.916 --> 00:25:51.984
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
what's happening?

546
00:25:51.984 --> 00:25:53.219
What is this?

547
00:25:53.219 --> 00:25:55.321
Are you happy?

548
00:25:55.321 --> 00:25:56.856
Well. why not?

549
00:25:56.856 --> 00:26:01.060
The sun is shining.
my star is rising--

550
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.630
and Baby Shark is
in Chomp City. swimming

551
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.331
ever closer to my trap.

552
00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:07.967
The only thing that can
break the Siren Stone's spell

553
00:26:07.967 --> 00:26:10.536
is the song of the catchiest
fish in the sea.

554
00:26:10.637 --> 00:26:12.939
So once I steal Baby
Shark's star mark.

555
00:26:12.939 --> 00:26:14.540
nothing will stand in my way.

556
00:26:14.641 --> 00:26:16.308
You're such a genius. Stariana.

557
00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:19.646
I mean. hiring Baby Shark's mom
to work for you to bring him

558
00:26:19.646 --> 00:26:22.448
closer. Elon Mollusk wishes.

559
00:26:22.448 --> 00:26:24.150
I know.

560
00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:25.685
Sometimes I think
I'm so smart that I

561
00:26:25.685 --> 00:26:27.253
could be really
successful if I just

562
00:26:27.253 --> 00:26:28.420
put in an honest day's work.

563
00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.056
But where's the fun in that?

564
00:26:30.056 --> 00:26:33.726
Once I steal Baby Shark's
musical life force.

565
00:26:33.726 --> 00:26:36.028
I will be unstoppable.

566
00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:38.965
My Chomptacular performance
will put everyfishy

567
00:26:38.965 --> 00:26:41.901
in the whole wide
water under my spell.

568
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:46.372
and I will rule the ocean
as is my rightful destiny.

569
00:26:46.372 --> 00:26:50.309
BTDubs. what's the sitch with
tracking down the Siren Stone?

570
00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:51.410
Oh!

571
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.112
Uh. It's going well!

572
00:26:53.112 --> 00:26:55.982
I have several promising
leads. and I've only

573
00:26:55.982 --> 00:26:58.050
had my identity stolen once.

574
00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.752
Good.

575
00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:06.826
Uh. where is
Mrs. Shark. anyway?

576
00:27:06.826 --> 00:27:08.695
Good morning!

577
00:27:08.695 --> 00:27:10.062
OK. so I have
our whole day planned out

578
00:27:10.062 --> 00:27:12.031
starting with your fave
breakfast sandwiches.

579
00:27:12.031 --> 00:27:13.265
And then--

580
00:27:13.265 --> 00:27:15.434
Planned out?
Leah. I'm running late.

581
00:27:15.434 --> 00:27:17.937
But you just got here.

582
00:27:17.937 --> 00:27:20.606
You really don't have
a day to hang out?

583
00:27:20.707 --> 00:27:22.008
Sorry.

584
00:27:22.008 --> 00:27:25.411
I promise we'll do
catch up time soon!

585
00:27:25.411 --> 00:27:28.180
Breakfast sando to-go it is!

586
00:27:32.418 --> 00:27:34.086
Oh. thank you.

587
00:27:34.086 --> 00:27:37.056
And. uh. keep him in one
piece while I'm out. OK?

588
00:27:37.056 --> 00:27:40.426
You have my solemn word.

589
00:27:42.161 --> 00:27:45.732
Now are we going
to be on good behavior?

590
00:27:45.732 --> 00:27:48.267
Welcome to the Driftwood Derby!

591
00:27:53.339 --> 00:27:54.540
Whoo-hoo!

592
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.476
I'm gaining on you. Leah!

593
00:27:57.476 --> 00:27:58.778
Not in my house!

594
00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:17.396
Show me the light.

595
00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:20.399
Good. Good.

596
00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:22.468
Hm. no good.

597
00:28:23.936 --> 00:28:25.537
Coming through.

598
00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:28.174
- Hey. watch it.
- Whoa!

599
00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:41.954
Huh. must have gotten
mixed up with Baby's stuff.

600
00:28:42.955 --> 00:28:44.323
Mwah.

601
00:28:44.323 --> 00:28:46.092

Thank gill-ness you're here.

603
00:28:47.493 --> 00:28:49.796

604
00:28:49.796 --> 00:28:51.030
Assistant first.
best friend sec--

605
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.166
There she is!

606
00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:57.837
Oh. nice to meet you both.

607
00:28:57.837 --> 00:28:59.638
Aww.

608
00:28:59.638 --> 00:29:02.208
This must be Baby Shark!

609
00:29:02.208 --> 00:29:03.810
You got those tickets
I sent. right?

610
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.277
Yes. thank you again.

611
00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:07.880
He and his best friend
William are so. so excited.

612
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.581
especially to see ENHYPEN.

613
00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.083
Haven't heard of them.

614
00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:13.552
Anyway. he should stop
by to get an autograph.

615
00:29:13.552 --> 00:29:16.455
I'd love to meet him.

616
00:29:16.455 --> 00:29:19.091
That's so kind of you.

617
00:29:19.091 --> 00:29:21.693
Oh. it's the
least I could do.

618
00:29:23.129 --> 00:29:24.831
Whoo-hoo!

619
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.969
Ooh. I like your bracelet.

620
00:29:29.969 --> 00:29:31.337
Thanks!

621
00:29:31.337 --> 00:29:32.872
My best friend.
William has one. too.

622
00:29:32.872 --> 00:29:34.841
He lives back
in Carnivore Cove.

623
00:29:34.841 --> 00:29:36.175
Oh. cool.

624
00:29:36.175 --> 00:29:38.945
But. uh. hey. I know!

625
00:29:38.945 --> 00:29:41.047
How about we make up
a secret tail-shake?

626
00:29:41.047 --> 00:29:43.582
That is such a good idea.

627
00:29:43.582 --> 00:29:45.017
How do we do that?

628
00:29:45.017 --> 00:29:47.854
How about we shark
shimmy. patty-cake fin.

629
00:29:47.854 --> 00:29:49.355
do a spin. and--

630
00:29:49.355 --> 00:29:50.890
Whoa!

631
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.593
That is not how
that usually goes.

632
00:29:54.593 --> 00:29:56.328
Ahh!

633
00:29:56.328 --> 00:29:57.563
Gotcha!

634
00:29:59.031 --> 00:30:01.400
Whew. isn't the Driftwood
Derby great. Baby?

635
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.035
What could you be
doing in Carnivore Cove

636
00:30:03.035 --> 00:30:05.071
that's more fun than this?

637
00:30:05.071 --> 00:30:06.638
Oh. no!

638
00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:08.174

Baby!

652
00:30:40.873 --> 00:30:42.708
I saved your spot for you.

What?

659
00:30:59.125 --> 00:31:00.326
What did she say?

660
00:31:00.326 --> 00:31:02.061
"Wavy haberdashery"?

661
00:31:02.061 --> 00:31:05.597
<i>Oh. it's kinda
an inside joke.</i>

662
00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:08.167

00:31:10.937 --> 00:31:12.939
<i>Oh. uh--</i>

665

He has inside jokes without me.

675
00:31:30.156 --> 00:31:33.592
My life is over.

676
00:31:33.592 --> 00:31:35.361
Hey. Baby!
Wanna race?

677
00:31:35.361 --> 00:31:36.462
I know you won
the first. second.

678
00:31:36.462 --> 00:31:37.663
and. well-- all seven rounds.

679
00:31:37.663 --> 00:31:38.965
But this one's mine!

680
00:31:38.965 --> 00:31:40.399
Oh. I can feel it in my fins.

681
00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:41.968
I'll take that action!

682
00:31:41.968 --> 00:31:43.835
Whoo!

683
00:31:52.311 --> 00:31:54.780
Somefishy's got
the birthday blues.

684
00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.348
Talk to me. bubba.

685
00:31:56.348 --> 00:32:01.053
It's just-- it wasn't
the same without Baby here.

686
00:32:01.053 --> 00:32:03.655
Hey. listen.
you're best friends.

687
00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:06.325
A little distance
can't change that.

688
00:32:06.325 --> 00:32:08.494
Thanks. Mom.

689
00:32:08.494 --> 00:32:10.396
You're like the wisest.

690
00:32:10.396 --> 00:32:12.764
And besides.
you'll see him again soon.

691
00:32:14.066 --> 00:32:15.834
Could it be?

692
00:32:15.834 --> 00:32:17.703
OK. we got
the party snackies.

693
00:32:17.703 --> 00:32:19.638
we got the glow
in the dark body paint.

694
00:32:19.638 --> 00:32:21.240
and you fishies
will never believe--

695
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.042
Next door.

696
00:32:23.042 --> 00:32:24.243
Uh. right.

697
00:32:24.243 --> 00:32:25.877
My bad.

698
00:32:26.012 --> 00:32:29.015
At least Baby's grandparents
seem to be doing OK.

699
00:32:29.015 --> 00:32:30.382
Whoo!

700
00:32:30.382 --> 00:32:33.519
All right. party prawn
squids. and fish!

701
00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:37.156
They call me
Solid Gold Glamdaddy.

702
00:32:37.156 --> 00:32:39.825
And it's time to chomp 'n roll!

703
00:32:41.293 --> 00:32:45.764
Granola Granny Goddess
says public art for all!

704
00:32:45.764 --> 00:32:47.166
Welcome to--

705
00:32:47.166 --> 00:32:49.168
both: Burning Sand!

706
00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.609
I can't believe I missed
William's birthday party.

707
00:32:57.609 --> 00:33:00.379
I'm sorry. squiddo.

708
00:33:00.379 --> 00:33:03.315
I just feel so homesick.

709
00:33:03.315 --> 00:33:07.086
but I guess this is home now.

710
00:33:07.086 --> 00:33:08.954
both: Hm.

711
00:33:09.055 --> 00:33:12.291
I mean. the Mail Whale
here isn't even a whale!

712
00:33:12.291 --> 00:33:14.426
Got yer mail here.

713
00:33:14.426 --> 00:33:16.662
See?

714
00:33:16.662 --> 00:33:20.299
I just miss my old life.

715
00:33:20.299 --> 00:33:22.434
Baby.

716
00:33:22.434 --> 00:33:25.104
Should I recite a poem
about plankton to him?

717
00:33:25.104 --> 00:33:26.572
To cheer him up?

718
00:33:26.572 --> 00:33:28.840
Maybe later. pup.

719
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.609
OK.

720
00:33:35.247 --> 00:33:36.782
You know. Baby.

721
00:33:36.782 --> 00:33:39.451
Having a best friend is like
being in any great pop duo--

722
00:33:39.451 --> 00:33:42.621
sometimes you sing together.
and sometimes you sing apart.

723
00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:43.955
Like your mom and me.

724
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:45.924
But you two
hardly talk anymore.

725
00:33:45.924 --> 00:33:48.160
Does that even
count as fin-ship?

726
00:33:49.328 --> 00:33:50.796
Look.

727
00:33:50.796 --> 00:33:52.664
Just promise me you'll try.

728
00:33:52.664 --> 00:33:54.166
You'll love it here.

729
00:33:54.166 --> 00:33:56.135
There are more things
to do in Chomp City

730
00:33:56.135 --> 00:33:58.670
than there are grains
of sand in the ocean.

731
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:00.406
Anything can happen.

732
00:34:00.406 --> 00:34:01.840
Who knows?

733
00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.475
Maybe you'll even make
a new best friend.

734
00:34:03.475 --> 00:34:05.744
A new best friend?

735
00:34:05.744 --> 00:34:10.549
Ha. Mommy says you're
funny. but that is rich.

736
00:34:10.549 --> 00:34:12.284
Baby?

737
00:34:12.284 --> 00:34:15.554
Swear on your star mark
you'll give Chomp City a shot?

738
00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:16.622
Boop!

739
00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.527
OK. swear on my star mark.

740
00:34:21.527 --> 00:34:23.229
Hm.

741
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.936
Uh. what's going on. hon?

742
00:34:30.936 --> 00:34:32.571
If I'm going to get
my teeth cleaned by Dr.

743
00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:37.876
Sawtooth tomorrow. they need
to be abso-toothly sparkling!

744
00:34:39.645 --> 00:34:42.648
You think
she'll sign my retainer?

745
00:34:42.648 --> 00:34:43.915
At least one
of you fishies is

746
00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:45.551
adjusting well to city life.

747
00:34:52.224 --> 00:34:53.925
Ick!
Ugh!

748
00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:55.927
Nature! Why?

749
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.465
My mouth!

750
00:34:59.465 --> 00:35:01.467
It went in my mouth!

751
00:35:01.467 --> 00:35:03.169
I told you to find
the Siren Stone.

752
00:35:03.169 --> 00:35:04.970
not take me backpacking!

753
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.738
Ugh. the things I do for power.

754
00:35:06.738 --> 00:35:09.375
How did you track
it down. anyways?

755
00:35:09.375 --> 00:35:12.644
Oh. I just did some research.
befriended a quirky but kindly

756
00:35:12.644 --> 00:35:14.546
old monkfish. who gave
me a sacred scroll. used

757
00:35:14.546 --> 00:35:16.915
disappearing squid ink
to reveal the hidden symbols.

758
00:35:16.915 --> 00:35:19.050
and from there I
triangulated the coordinates.

759
00:35:19.185 --> 00:35:20.085
But the hardest--

760
00:35:20.186 --> 00:35:21.086
Shh!

761
00:35:21.187 --> 00:35:22.521
Look!

762
00:35:32.598 --> 00:35:35.100
The Siren Stone.

763
00:35:50.582 --> 00:35:53.819
It's beautiful!

764
00:35:53.819 --> 00:35:55.854
And it's mine.

765
00:35:57.456 --> 00:35:58.824
OK.

766
00:35:58.824 --> 00:36:01.427
It's really. uh--
really stuck in there.

767
00:36:01.427 --> 00:36:03.495
Rude!

768
00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:06.064
Ah!

769
00:36:06.064 --> 00:36:07.799
Ah!

770
00:36:10.602 --> 00:36:12.238
The Stone!

771
00:36:12.238 --> 00:36:16.141
With this power. Baby Shark's
star mark is as good as mine.

772
00:36:16.242 --> 00:36:19.678
And then. I will have
complete control!

773
00:36:19.678 --> 00:36:21.046

What if things are--

822
00:39:05.444 --> 00:39:08.847
I don't know.
different between us?

823
00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:12.050
Aw. I'm sure you
two will have a blast.

824
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:14.920

Now you sure you know
the way to Chomp City?

828
00:39:31.437 --> 00:39:33.204
Mom. I'm a pilot fish.

829
00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:34.740
Directions are in my blood.

830
00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.443
Also. I just got this
cool app called Waterways!

831
00:39:37.443 --> 00:39:39.578
So there's no way I'm
going to get lost!

832
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:46.251
This can't be right.

833
00:39:49.521 --> 00:39:51.857
Whoa!

834
00:39:57.095 --> 00:39:59.465
Wow.

835
00:40:01.933 --> 00:40:04.703

See. you back home.
I have this

840
00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:18.116
wry fast-talking
charm that usually

841
00:40:18.116 --> 00:40:19.417
gets me out of hot water--

842
00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:22.854
William?

843
00:40:22.854 --> 00:40:25.491

Wah!

847

Why don't you ever stop?

848
00:40:43.942 --> 00:40:45.877
Can you believe I live here?

849
00:40:45.877 --> 00:40:47.178
Not really.

850
00:40:47.178 --> 00:40:48.980
I can't wait to
show you around.

851
00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.015
No way!

852
00:40:50.015 --> 00:40:52.150

853
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:53.619
Ha-ha-ho!

854
00:40:53.619 --> 00:40:56.722
The fishes back home
are going to love this.

855
00:40:56.722 --> 00:40:59.958
Oh. so that's
a haberdashery.

856
00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.796
"Wavy haberdashery."

857
00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:05.964
Those words.

858
00:41:05.964 --> 00:41:07.432
So random!

859
00:41:07.533 --> 00:41:10.836
Yeah. it's hard to explain.

860

Baby Shark.

1259
00:59:01.138 --> 00:59:03.608
So can we help you?

1260
00:59:03.608 --> 00:59:05.175
Oh. right. Help.

1261
00:59:05.175 --> 00:59:06.777

Oh. my gills. you have
the voice of an angelfish.

1265
00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:17.087
Well. turns out.
she's super evil.

1266
00:59:17.087 --> 00:59:19.489
She wants to rule
the whole wide water.

1267
00:59:19.624 --> 00:59:21.726
Your dance moves
are breathtaking.

1268
00:59:21.726 --> 00:59:23.527
And she fish-napped
my very best friend

1269
00:59:23.628 --> 00:59:25.329
to get me to help her do it!

1270
00:59:25.329 --> 00:59:26.964
I respect you deeply.

1271
00:59:26.964 --> 00:59:30.067
Also. she's using something
called the Siren Stone?

1272
00:59:30.067 --> 00:59:32.436
I think that's what's making
everyfishy obsessed with her!

1273
00:59:32.436 --> 00:59:35.906
They've got these dead eyes.
and they're all smiley. so--

1274
00:59:35.906 --> 00:59:38.643
um. yeah!

1275
00:59:42.847 --> 00:59:45.850
I sound ridiculous. don't I?

1276
00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:48.452
He has a star mark.

1277
00:59:48.452 --> 00:59:50.955
Oh. Yeah.

1278
00:59:50.955 --> 00:59:52.890
It's kind of my trademark.

1279
00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:54.358
You know what we have to do?

1280
00:59:54.358 --> 00:59:56.393
Gear up. everyfishy.

1281
01:00:03.968 --> 01:00:04.902
Whoa.

1282
01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:06.971
We're not just a boy band.

1283
01:00:06.971 --> 01:00:09.573
We're an elite team
of musical operatives

1284
01:00:09.573 --> 01:00:14.078
sworn to protect the harmony
of the underwater universe.

1285
01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:22.653
Wha--

1286
01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:24.822
Shocking but true.

1287
01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:26.657
You're right about
the Siren Stone.

1288
01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:29.727
It's a powerful piece
of ancient musical magic.

1289
01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:31.962
We noticed it was missing.

1290
01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.197
No.

1291
01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:35.599
But we couldn't
track its location.

1292
01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:38.969
If Stariana performs at the
Chomptacular using the power

1293
01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.839
of the Siren Stone.
she'll steal the song

1294
01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:44.274
from everyfishy's soul.

1295
01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:50.247
Once that happens. nofishy
will be able to sing any song

1296
01:00:50.247 --> 01:00:51.481
but hers.

1297
01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.183
But why is she after me?

1298
01:00:53.183 --> 01:00:54.518
Because of this.

1299
01:00:54.518 --> 01:00:56.253
My star mark?

1300
01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:59.356
Legend has it that the
catchiest fish in the sea

1301
01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:00.925
is marked by a star.

1302
01:01:00.925 --> 01:01:03.961
If Stariana steals
your song and your star mark.

1303
01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:05.362
she'll be unstoppable.

1304
01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:07.998
Yeah. that's why she
fish-napped your friend.

1305
01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:12.202
So this is all because of me?

1306
01:01:12.202 --> 01:01:13.771
Poor William!

1307
01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:18.342
I wish-- I wish he and I were
never friends to begin with.

1308
01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:20.745
Then we wouldn't have
gotten into a fight.

1309
01:01:20.745 --> 01:01:23.280
And he wouldn't
be in trouble now!

1310
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:26.483
C'mon. Baby.

1311
01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:27.818
Don't say that.

1312
01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:29.920
Sometimes. we hurt
our friends' feelings.

1313
01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.190
We drift apart. and
come back together.

1314
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.959
It may not always
look perfect.

1315
01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:36.994
but when you care
for some-fish else.

1316
01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:38.763
nothing can take that away.

1317
01:01:38.763 --> 01:01:39.864
Yeah.

1318
01:01:39.864 --> 01:01:41.531
Fin-ship conquers all.

1319
01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:45.335
And the fin-ship between you
and William can conquer this.

1320
01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:47.337
Do you really think so?

1321
01:01:47.337 --> 01:01:53.077
Fin-ship is the only thing
more powerful than music.

1322
01:01:54.779 --> 01:01:58.415
So you're ready to gear up?

1323
01:01:58.415 --> 01:01:59.516
Am I?

1324
01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:04.488
Can we have a tie. too?

1325
01:02:04.488 --> 01:02:09.059
You bet.

1326
01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:12.162
