Uh... Maggie. I mean.

182
00:13:39.993 --> 00:13:41.516
I guess Margaret's
more appropriate.

183
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.562
If you're gonna be
a good liar.

184
00:13:45.302 --> 00:13:46.956
you better recognize
who's lyin' to you.

185
00:13:47.783 --> 00:13:49.219
She's not your mother.
is she?

186
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.136
[Charlie] Hey. are we leavin'?

187
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.703
Time to move.

188
00:13:54.746 --> 00:13:55.965
But it's hot out there.

189
00:13:56.618 --> 00:13:58.054
No point in staying here.

190
00:13:59.012 --> 00:14:00.840
Zero transportation.

191
00:14:00.883 --> 00:14:03.668
The horses are dead.
the tractor's dry.

192
00:14:04.408 --> 00:14:07.585
I got a bicycle.
I can ride ahead
and get us some supplies.

193
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:09.500
Good. Go on. then.

194
00:14:16.029 --> 00:14:19.119
You! Put your hands up
in the air and down
on your knees!

195
00:14:21.164 --> 00:14:23.079
Hey. hey. hey!
Look what I found!

196
00:14:23.993 --> 00:14:25.255
[chuckles] You like it?

197
00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:27.649
So they made you
sheriff. huh?

198
00:14:27.692 --> 00:14:30.782
Yup! Whole town voted.
Unanimous.

199
00:14:30.826 --> 00:14:34.134
Let me guess.
You were the only one
available for the job.

200
00:14:34.177 --> 00:14:36.092
[chuckles] Yeah.
Why you have to ruin it?

201
00:14:36.136 --> 00:14:38.660
Get out. I'm drivin'.

202
00:14:38.703 --> 00:14:39.922
Oh. man.

203
00:14:39.966 --> 00:14:42.533
[car chiming]

204
00:14:50.193 --> 00:14:53.153
- You did good. Windows up.
- What? We're gonna melt!

205
00:14:53.196 --> 00:14:56.330
Windows down creates drag.
We lose mileage.

206
00:14:56.373 --> 00:14:58.767
It's gonna be hot.
but it beats walkin'.

207
00:15:00.029 --> 00:15:01.248
Did you find any guns?

208
00:15:02.205 --> 00:15:03.728
No. No guns.

209
00:15:03.772 --> 00:15:05.295
Did you check the station?

210
00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:06.470
Didn't find it.

211
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.300
- Hold on.

214
00:15:19.527 --> 00:15:21.442
[Charlie] Why are we
creepin' around here?

215
00:15:21.485 --> 00:15:23.139
[John] Just takin'
a look around.

216
00:15:23.966 --> 00:15:26.403
[Charlie] Yeah.
but if there was anybody here.
they'll be dead.

217
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.972
[John] That means the Master
could've been here before us.

218
00:15:34.585 --> 00:15:37.197
Stay here.
Keep the doors locked.

219
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.503
What? What am I. eight?

220
00:15:41.114 --> 00:15:42.158
You hear me?

221
00:15:51.298 --> 00:15:55.215
[brooding music playing]

[flies buzz]

223
00:16:09.838 --> 00:16:10.926
[woman] He's dead!

224
00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:14.843
Did you shoot him?

225
00:16:14.886 --> 00:16:15.844
Yep.

226
00:16:16.497 --> 00:16:17.846
What about her?

227
00:16:17.889 --> 00:16:19.195
Shot her too.

228
00:16:19.239 --> 00:16:21.110
Seems like you can
take care of yourself.

229
00:16:21.154 --> 00:16:22.372
I get by.

230
00:16:30.337 --> 00:16:32.730
- Did you see any others lately?
- Nope.

231
00:16:33.818 --> 00:16:35.646
Well. I guess
I'll keep lookin'.

232
00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.822
[Doris] What exactly
are you looking for?

233
00:16:37.866 --> 00:16:40.042
The leader. The Master.

234
00:16:41.348 --> 00:16:42.566
You best come in. then.

235
00:16:48.398 --> 00:16:50.792
Where you're going.
you're going to need this.

236
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.404
What about you?

237
00:16:54.448 --> 00:16:55.840
Danger's still out there.

238
00:16:55.884 --> 00:16:57.886
When you kill the Master.

239
00:16:58.495 --> 00:17:01.759
it's gonna take the world
a long time to recover.

240
00:17:01.803 --> 00:17:03.631
I won't live to see it.

241
00:17:03.674 --> 00:17:07.548
All I have to look forward to
is more of this shit.

242
00:17:07.591 --> 00:17:09.158
Don't you wanna see
the beginning?

243
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.334
I know you'll do it.

244
00:17:12.553 --> 00:17:13.989
Take this.

245
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.513
A man of the cloth
needs a crucifix.

246
00:17:16.557 --> 00:17:18.950
It'll see you through
to your darkest hour.

247
00:17:23.346 --> 00:17:24.478
Thank you.

248
00:17:25.957 --> 00:17:27.872
You want us to bury
those bodies?

249
00:17:27.916 --> 00:17:29.309
No. leave it.

250
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.616
Let it be a warning
to any other assholes
who come around.

251

[Doris] You take care now.

254

Always trust in the crucifix.

to the light.

Another dead town.

259
00:18:06.172 --> 00:18:09.000
Are we to walk and walk.

260
00:18:09.044 --> 00:18:12.613
with only dust
to cover our tongues?

261
00:18:13.918 --> 00:18:16.051
The Master is here.

262
00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:20.403
He shall provide
for us. [grunts]

263
00:18:20.447 --> 00:18:22.536
What if he doesn't?

264
00:18:22.579 --> 00:18:23.928
[sighs]

265
00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:26.757
You worry too much.

266
00:18:26.801 --> 00:18:29.934
What of this
can you change?

267
00:18:29.978 --> 00:18:31.153
Nothing.

268
00:18:31.762 --> 00:18:34.939
I'm just merely
voicing my concerns.

[scoffs]
You are not alone.

270
00:18:38.465 --> 00:18:41.337
We are all sharing
your concerns.

271
00:18:41.946 --> 00:18:44.253
But unlike you.

272
00:18:44.297 --> 00:18:48.562
I think my mind
is better than yours
to find the solution.

273
00:18:48.605 --> 00:18:49.693
Enough!

274
00:18:50.825 --> 00:18:54.002
Do you want the Master to think
that you don't respect me?

275
00:18:54.698 --> 00:18:56.918
No. my Queen.
I apologize--

276
00:18:56.961 --> 00:18:58.311
Respect me!

Indeed.

290

How many have you raised?

291
00:19:48.622 --> 00:19:49.971
Just these three.

brought you more

is drawing close.

Well. maybe we could go forage
and step on others.

There is a hunter coming.

299

We deal with him.

like children.

no resistance.

but no problem to us at all.

You show
a little character.

332
00:21:32.856 --> 00:21:34.945
Maybe we can have
use of you after.

you treat your daughters?

You see what the world is now.

What? You'd rather
have taken his place?

00:22:50.238 --> 00:22:52.283
No. God. no.

361
00:22:52.327 --> 00:22:53.502
[sobbing]

362
00:22:54.547 --> 00:22:58.246
And you. You took that man
to be your husband?

363
00:22:58.289 --> 00:23:00.553
Look at the way
he treated your daughters.

364
00:23:01.554 --> 00:23:03.817
He had money.
he was a good provider!

365
00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.471
That's what this is about?

366
00:23:06.123 --> 00:23:08.430
- [mother screams. cries]
- [flesh crunches]

367
00:23:09.736 --> 00:23:11.607
You want a path
out of here?

368
00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:13.479
- [screams. laughs]
- Yes. I want out of here.

369
00:23:13.522 --> 00:23:16.307
I do! But not the way
you have in mind.

370
00:23:16.351 --> 00:23:19.528
I'd rather meet my maker
with this pure soul!

371
00:23:19.572 --> 00:23:22.009
[laughs]

372
00:23:22.792 --> 00:23:25.752
Well. what about me?
Ain't I good enough for you?

373
00:23:25.795 --> 00:23:26.840
[Queen chuckles]

374
00:23:26.883 --> 00:23:28.015
That's right.

375
00:23:28.755 --> 00:23:32.149
All you are
is blood to me.

376
00:23:32.193 --> 00:23:36.502
And you will live
until I say you die.

377
00:23:37.198 --> 00:23:38.329
[laughs]

378
00:23:38.373 --> 00:23:40.201
I-I...
I could join you.

379
00:23:40.244 --> 00:23:41.942
[laughs]

380
00:23:45.075 --> 00:23:46.860
There's a battle coming.

381
00:23:46.903 --> 00:23:50.167
One that has been brewing
for centuries.

382
00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:56.304
and all you'd be is a waste
of blood meant for others.

383
00:24:00.482 --> 00:24:03.093
Feast. Feed.

384
00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:06.575
- Thank you. my Queen.
- Enjoy.

385
00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:20.763
Who are you?

386
00:24:21.677 --> 00:24:23.157
Why are you here?

387
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.115
My name's Jeff.

388
00:24:25.812 --> 00:24:28.249
I-I'm just a farmer.
they bit me.

389
00:24:28.292 --> 00:24:30.556
I was forced
to follow them here.

390
00:24:30.599 --> 00:24:32.253
You don't belong here.

391
00:24:32.296 --> 00:24:34.908
I know.
I don't wanna be here.

392
00:24:34.951 --> 00:24:36.736
I don't want any of this.

393
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.566
I want life to be back
the way it used to be.

394
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:46.441
It will never be
the way it used to be.

395
00:24:49.313 --> 00:24:50.358
You're free.

396
00:24:52.926 --> 00:24:54.754
But-- but where do I go?

397
00:24:55.581 --> 00:24:56.495
Go!

398
00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.845
Go!

399
00:24:58.888 --> 00:25:01.064
[snarling]

400
00:25:01.108 --> 00:25:02.892
[Philamena] We can't
just leave him here.

401
00:25:02.936 --> 00:25:04.764
He'll attract flies
and maggots.

402
00:25:05.329 --> 00:25:07.680
We need to draw
as little attention as possible.

403
00:25:07.723 --> 00:25:09.682
and using half our manpower
to drag him up there

404
00:25:09.725 --> 00:25:11.031
where they're at ain't it.

405
00:25:11.074 --> 00:25:13.860
Why? You think
they're gonna
forget about us?

406
00:25:13.903 --> 00:25:15.339
We're all
gonna die here.

407
00:25:19.779 --> 00:25:20.997
Why don't you ask him?

408
00:25:25.175 --> 00:25:27.047
- Please.
- [growls]

409
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.528
You don't want me.
I have hepatitis.

410
00:25:30.616 --> 00:25:31.921
Oh. really?

411
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.011
So you think I should
just let you go?

412
00:25:35.055 --> 00:25:36.317
You have the rest of us.

413
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.061
How many more
are suddenly gonna pop up
with blood diseases?

414
00:25:42.018 --> 00:25:44.281
Or be near death.
if I show you mercy.

415
00:25:44.325 --> 00:25:46.545
- It's true!
- [snarls]

416
00:25:47.894 --> 00:25:49.330
[villagers sobbing]

417
00:25:53.856 --> 00:25:55.466
[growls]

418
00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.556
This will do.

419
00:25:59.209 --> 00:26:02.778
Watch me.
or you'll be next.

420
00:26:02.822 --> 00:26:04.867
[growls]

421
00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:07.130
[hisses]

422
00:26:11.134 --> 00:26:12.266
[woman gasps]

423
00:26:22.015 --> 00:26:23.843
You turned fast.

424
00:26:24.713 --> 00:26:26.106
Faster than the others.

425
00:26:26.846 --> 00:26:28.238
Do you feel it?

426
00:26:28.282 --> 00:26:30.284
I can't fight it.

427
00:26:30.327 --> 00:26:31.894
[sobs]

428
00:26:31.938 --> 00:26:35.071
I need... I need to.

429
00:26:35.768 --> 00:26:38.161
[Vampire Queen]
And you're gonna start
right here.

430
00:26:38.205 --> 00:26:39.859
Feed on the ones
you love.

431
00:26:39.902 --> 00:26:42.252
- [women sob]
- [mumbles] ...feeding.

432
00:26:42.296 --> 00:26:43.819
- [sobs]
- [Sarah] No...

433
00:26:43.863 --> 00:26:45.473
Mom. no.

434
00:26:45.516 --> 00:26:47.606
[Helen] Please.
You can't do it.

435
00:26:47.649 --> 00:26:49.042
Fight it!

436
00:26:49.085 --> 00:26:51.435
I won't do it.

437
00:26:51.479 --> 00:26:52.959
I could never!

438
00:26:53.829 --> 00:26:54.961
[chuckles]

439
00:26:55.004 --> 00:26:56.615
You're gonna feed
on your daughter.

440
00:26:57.398 --> 00:26:58.791
Maybe the others!

441
00:26:58.834 --> 00:27:02.011
No. I want you to feed
on your daughter.

442
00:27:02.055 --> 00:27:05.406
You'll need the energy
and you will feel alive.

443
00:27:05.449 --> 00:27:08.322
I refuse!
I'm not like you!

444
00:27:08.365 --> 00:27:10.150
Oh. yes.
you're just like me.

445
00:27:10.933 --> 00:27:13.327
You'll see. You'll see.

446
00:27:17.374 --> 00:27:18.637
[follower] What is it. my lord?

447
00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:25.992
I have taught
my apprentice well.

448
00:27:26.035 --> 00:27:27.515
I don't understand.

449
00:27:28.211 --> 00:27:31.737
For a long time.
I have felt a--

450
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.783
a contradiction within you.

451
00:27:34.827 --> 00:27:39.266
As if you were
holding a secret.

452
00:27:39.309 --> 00:27:41.268
I still don't understand.

453
00:27:41.311 --> 00:27:45.359
My spy. Did he hide
himself well?

454
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.362
Not at all. my lord.

455
00:27:49.276 --> 00:27:50.494
We knew he was there.

456
00:27:51.191 --> 00:27:52.801
Almost from the start.

457
00:27:52.845 --> 00:27:54.107
Exactly.

458
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.500
He sent a spy.

459
00:27:56.544 --> 00:27:58.894
thinking I would
not notice the one

460
00:27:58.938 --> 00:28:02.202
right beside me.

461
00:28:02.245 --> 00:28:06.162
- [grunts]
- [Ultimate Master laughs]

462
00:28:08.556 --> 00:28:09.992
Why?

463
00:28:10.036 --> 00:28:13.213
You had everything!

464
00:28:14.083 --> 00:28:17.304
But you betray me! Why?

465
00:28:17.347 --> 00:28:19.088
I want to be
on the winning side.

466
00:28:19.132 --> 00:28:21.351
[Ultimate Master laughs]

467
00:28:21.395 --> 00:28:25.181
- You idiotic fool!
- [flesh squelches]

468
00:28:25.225 --> 00:28:27.183
[grunts and groans]

469
00:28:27.227 --> 00:28:31.361
[grunting]

470
00:28:33.886 --> 00:28:37.759
- [engine revs]
- [John] Yo.

471
00:28:37.803 --> 00:28:39.892
- [Charlie groans]
- We've got somebody up ahead.

472
00:28:39.935 --> 00:28:41.589
[Charlie sighs]
He's probably been bitten.

473
00:28:41.632 --> 00:28:44.244
We should just
run him over.
Just in case.

474
00:28:44.287 --> 00:28:45.462
What is wrong
with you?

475
00:28:46.202 --> 00:28:48.465
I wanna stay alive.
that's what's wrong.

476
00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:50.032
Staying alive is one thing.

477
00:28:50.076 --> 00:28:51.599
Keeping your humanity
is another.

478
00:28:52.252 --> 00:28:53.732
Well. maybe
I don't have any.

479
00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.951
Everybody's got it.

480
00:28:56.952 --> 00:28:58.780
It's a choice whether
you keep it or not.

481
00:29:03.654 --> 00:29:05.744
Get out! Real slow.

482
00:29:07.006 --> 00:29:08.834
Just step outside
and keep cool.

483
00:29:09.443 --> 00:29:10.487
[Charlie sighs]

484
00:29:13.055 --> 00:29:14.100
[grunts]

485
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.191
You all right?

486
00:29:18.931 --> 00:29:21.803
I'm good. I could use
a ride. though.

487
00:29:23.022 --> 00:29:24.023
Where you headed?

488
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.025
I don't know.

489
00:29:26.852 --> 00:29:28.723
Would appreciate it
if you lowered the weapon.

490
00:29:31.117 --> 00:29:32.074
Okay.

491
00:29:33.728 --> 00:29:37.340
You can ride with us
but I gotta check you
for bite marks.

492
00:29:39.081 --> 00:29:42.781
I can understand that.
man. but I guarantee ya.

493
00:29:43.651 --> 00:29:44.783
I ain't been bitten.

494
00:29:46.697 --> 00:29:47.916
Hop in the back.

495
00:29:51.441 --> 00:29:54.662
[brooding western music playing]

496
00:29:56.969 --> 00:29:59.841
I'm John. This is Charlie.

497
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:02.496
I'm Rico.

498
00:30:03.627 --> 00:30:05.281
- Hey. Rico.
- Yeah?

499
00:30:05.325 --> 00:30:07.457
Not the first time in the back
of a police car. huh?

500
00:30:07.501 --> 00:30:08.545
[laughs]

501
00:30:10.243 --> 00:30:11.679
[John laughs]

502
00:30:11.722 --> 00:30:13.376
You gotta love
the nerve. huh?

503
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.520
- Got one!
- Yes! Now we can try

504
00:30:26.563 --> 00:30:28.565
- the garlic shotgun shells.
- Yes.

505
00:30:31.307 --> 00:30:32.961
[engine roars]

506
00:30:35.007 --> 00:30:36.312
[Brooke]
Don't get too confident.

507
00:30:36.356 --> 00:30:38.053
Some of them can move fast.

508
00:30:38.097 --> 00:30:39.750
[Elena] Nah.
not this one. Look at him.

509
00:30:39.794 --> 00:30:41.622
He hasn't fed
in a long time.

510
00:30:41.665 --> 00:30:43.929
He's all... [moans. chuckles]

511
00:30:44.581 --> 00:30:46.453
[laughs]

512
00:30:46.496 --> 00:30:47.541
Let's get him.

513
00:30:54.287 --> 00:30:56.593
- You gotta aim for the heart.
- I am.

514
00:31:03.426 --> 00:31:04.558
[blood splatters]

515
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.081
[chuckles]

516
00:31:06.995 --> 00:31:08.649
Hey. careful.

517
00:31:08.692 --> 00:31:10.390
Okay. I got this.

518
00:31:11.043 --> 00:31:12.609
So bossy.

519
00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:20.748
[Brooke] Well.
look at that. You got him.

520
00:31:20.791 --> 00:31:24.230
That was a little too easy.
I like a challenge.

521
00:31:24.273 --> 00:31:26.667
All right.
Get him in the trunk.

522
00:31:30.366 --> 00:31:32.629
Uh. he's heavy.
Can I get a little help here?

523
00:31:33.195 --> 00:31:34.980
You kill him.
you bag him.

524
00:31:36.677 --> 00:31:37.765
Seriously?

525
00:31:41.508 --> 00:31:43.379
[engine roars]

526
00:31:47.557 --> 00:31:48.776
This could be trouble.

527
00:31:48.819 --> 00:31:50.386
What are we gonna do?

528
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.301
Let's see what they do.

529
00:31:52.345 --> 00:31:54.216
Get rid of the badge
and the hat.

530
00:31:54.825 --> 00:31:56.740
Some people get nervous
around cops.

531
00:31:56.784 --> 00:31:58.917
Well. let me out.
I don't look like no cop.

532
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.440
You can say that again.

533
00:32:00.483 --> 00:32:01.789
[Charlie chuckles]

534
00:32:01.832 --> 00:32:04.096
- [radio static]
- We are not cops.

535
00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:06.272
I repeat.

536
00:32:06.315 --> 00:32:08.883
- we are not police officers.
- [radio static]

537
00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:10.232
Stay cool.

[suspenseful music playing]

540
00:32:19.676 --> 00:32:22.418
Good job. You told us
you ain't cops.

541
00:32:23.028 --> 00:32:24.855
I figured that
was a good idea.

542
00:32:24.899 --> 00:32:27.293
So if you ain't cops then
what are you doing here?

543
00:32:27.336 --> 00:32:29.686
- We're vampire hunters.
- [Brooke chuckles]

544
00:32:30.557 --> 00:32:31.950
- Really?
- Yeah.

545
00:32:31.993 --> 00:32:33.734
So how many have you killed?

546
00:32:33.777 --> 00:32:34.909
Well. I'm in training.

547
00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:35.997
[both chuckle]

548
00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.653
Listen. we do that ourselves.
so we don't need you guys.

549
00:32:39.696 --> 00:32:41.698
Well. maybe you can help us.

550
00:32:42.525 --> 00:32:44.049
We're lookin'
for the Master.

551
00:32:44.092 --> 00:32:47.008
[ominous tones]

552
00:32:49.576 --> 00:32:52.057
Follow us.
We'll take you to Daddy.

553
00:33:04.286 --> 00:33:06.723
[brooding guitar music playing]

554
00:33:26.569 --> 00:33:28.093
- Who are these?
- [Brooke] They say

555
00:33:28.136 --> 00:33:30.225
- they're vampire hunters.
- [chuckles]

556
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:31.574
You kill any?

557
00:33:31.618 --> 00:33:32.662
Some.

558
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.056
We're lookin'
for the Master.

559
00:33:35.839 --> 00:33:37.276
He's come this way.

560
00:33:37.319 --> 00:33:40.018
And you think you got
what it takes to kill him?

561
00:33:40.757 --> 00:33:42.542
I aim to find out.

562
00:33:42.585 --> 00:33:44.022
We killed one today.

563
00:33:46.372 --> 00:33:47.416
Show me.

564
00:33:48.591 --> 00:33:50.071
[trunk door opens]

565
00:33:52.204 --> 00:33:53.640
That's Jeff Lockwood.

566
00:33:54.902 --> 00:33:56.469
He had a place over east.

567
00:33:57.165 --> 00:33:58.297
He was a good man.

568
00:33:58.906 --> 00:34:00.125
Came from that way.

569
00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.736
We buried a woman there.

570
00:34:02.779 --> 00:34:04.433
That's why we're out here.

571
00:34:05.347 --> 00:34:07.175
The old place
wasn't defensible.

572
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.831
At least out here
we can see 'em coming
and keep on runnin'.

573
00:34:13.312 --> 00:34:16.402
Well. at least we've got
a way to fight back now.

574
00:34:17.794 --> 00:34:21.320
You're mistaken.
This man wasn't fully turned.

575
00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:24.714
Best way you can fight back

576
00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.065
is help us.

577
00:34:28.327 --> 00:34:30.111
Come on inside.
Let's go talk.

578
00:34:37.162 --> 00:34:38.859
Chop that up and cook it.

579
00:34:38.902 --> 00:34:40.252
Doesn't work on them.

580
00:34:40.295 --> 00:34:42.036
Now how the hell
are you so sure about it?

581
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.124
Tried it.

582
00:34:43.168 --> 00:34:44.430
[Brooke] You got bit?

583
00:34:44.473 --> 00:34:45.779
But not turned.

584
00:34:46.475 --> 00:34:48.564
What does that make you?
The chosen one or something?

585
00:34:49.261 --> 00:34:50.175
Maybe.

586
00:34:51.306 --> 00:34:52.525
You comin' or what?

587
00:34:54.396 --> 00:34:55.397
Damn.

588
00:34:59.488 --> 00:35:02.317
It's alcohol.
It's for the vehicles.

589
00:35:02.361 --> 00:35:03.710
They've been converted.

590
00:35:03.753 --> 00:35:05.364
Where'd you get it?

591
00:35:05.407 --> 00:35:07.279
I got a still hidden-aways off.

592
00:35:08.802 --> 00:35:11.544
[John sighs]

593
00:35:12.371 --> 00:35:14.286
You must do
a lot of drivin'.

594
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:15.765
Most of it's not for us.

595
00:35:16.592 --> 00:35:19.073
There's a local militia
operating out of the mountains.

596
00:35:19.682 --> 00:35:22.946
They come down here
and they claim it as their tax.

597
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:25.862
Bunch of bullies
and thugs. mostly.

598
00:35:25.906 --> 00:35:27.690
Now they say they're Army.

599
00:35:27.734 --> 00:35:30.084
but I can tell by lookin'
at 'em. they ain't.

600
00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:32.130
- You served?
- Yeah.

601
00:35:33.392 --> 00:35:35.133
And the man that
your daughter killed.

602
00:35:36.308 --> 00:35:38.223
He came from the mountains.

603
00:35:38.266 --> 00:35:40.747
Do you think
those bloodsuckers
are up there?

604
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.009
Ah. maybe.

605
00:35:43.228 --> 00:35:45.534
But that guy could've been
walkin' around in circles.

606
00:35:45.578 --> 00:35:47.275
Who knows where
he started from.

607
00:35:48.276 --> 00:35:51.192
Now. you're gonna ask
the militia tomorrow.

608
00:35:51.236 --> 00:35:52.933
They should be
turnin' up then.

609
00:35:53.542 --> 00:35:54.761
You think they're
willing to help?

610
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.372
Yeah. If there's
something in it for them.

611
00:35:57.416 --> 00:35:59.069
You'll have to ask.

612
00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:02.464
Now. you're welcome
to stay here. if you want.

613
00:36:02.508 --> 00:36:03.944
but you'll have
to sleep outside.

614
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.252
I've got a bedroll.

615
00:36:08.688 --> 00:36:10.211
[Charlie] I don't.
Where am I sleeping?

616
00:36:15.347 --> 00:36:17.523
I think he needs to be buried
next to his wife.

617
00:36:18.437 --> 00:36:20.874
I'll take him
over there tomorrow
when our friends leave.

618
00:36:21.701 --> 00:36:23.224
They're staying?

619
00:36:23.268 --> 00:36:26.836
Yeah. just one night.
outside. It's okay.

620
00:36:27.533 --> 00:36:30.405
Hey. guys. I left my bike
back there aways.

621
00:36:30.449 --> 00:36:33.016
Is there any way
I can get a ride
and some gas?

622
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:35.193
I'll give you a ride.

623
00:36:41.068 --> 00:36:43.592
- [Rico] We got trouble.
- Aw. shit. Vampires.

624
00:36:43.636 --> 00:36:45.594
Sure looks like it.
What you gonna do?

625
00:36:45.638 --> 00:36:48.858
Uh. I got garlic
shotgun shells. You down?

626
00:36:49.424 --> 00:36:50.730
Hell. yeah. I'm down.

627
00:36:51.905 --> 00:36:54.777
Don't get too close. though.
Those things move fast.

628
00:36:54.821 --> 00:36:56.388
Don't worry. we got this.

629
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.221
How's this?

630
00:37:04.744 --> 00:37:05.962
Wait till they get
a little closer.

631
00:37:06.006 --> 00:37:07.355
Those shells
will spread out.

632
00:37:07.399 --> 00:37:09.879
especially with
my sawed-off. Now!

633
00:37:14.101 --> 00:37:16.451
[guns cock and fire]

634
00:37:21.935 --> 00:37:24.154
Screw this!
Let's get outta here.

635
00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.860
I reckon my bike
should be right up there.

636
00:37:34.774 --> 00:37:35.862
[Elena] Yeah. I see it.

637
00:37:53.749 --> 00:37:54.794
Nice bike.

638
00:37:55.534 --> 00:37:57.753
Thanks. It's my pride and joy.

639
00:37:58.624 --> 00:38:00.452
Only thing I've ever
really had. you know?

640
00:38:01.757 --> 00:38:04.456
You know. that alcohol
isn't too good for the engine.

641
00:38:05.065 --> 00:38:06.936
It's probably
gonna outlast me.

642
00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.982

Man. that sounds good.

645
00:38:20.559 --> 00:38:23.823
Now the only problem we got
is them vampires down the road.

646
00:38:23.866 --> 00:38:25.433
You want me
to run interference?

647
00:38:25.477 --> 00:38:26.869
No. don't worry about it.

648
00:38:26.913 --> 00:38:28.349
We'll just take
the long way home.

649
00:38:28.393 --> 00:38:30.569
Okay. Well. I'll catch you
at your daddy's place.

650
00:38:30.612 --> 00:38:31.613
[Elena] Okay.

00:39:13.916 --> 00:39:15.048
How is she runnin'?

660
00:39:15.091 --> 00:39:17.703
No complaints.
but we got us a problem.

661
00:39:17.746 --> 00:39:19.748
Ran into some vampires
back there.

662
00:39:19.792 --> 00:39:21.489
- Elena?
- Oh. she's good.

663
00:39:21.533 --> 00:39:23.404
She did a little detour
around 'em.

664
00:39:23.448 --> 00:39:25.363
But you know
those garlic shells?

665
00:39:26.015 --> 00:39:27.190
They don't work.

666
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.323
Looks like our friend
was right.

667
00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:31.456
And I'm afraid
they're coming this way.

668
00:39:32.413 --> 00:39:33.849
I'll stand guard tonight.

You! I will tear you
apart for that!

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:32.577
I will make you
suffer for that!

He ain't coming back
this time.

Looks like these crucifixes
are worth keepin'.

705
00:42:21.147 --> 00:42:23.758
Problem is they split
when they hit the target.

706

Can't use 'em again.

make some more.

No. Don't come close.

No! No.

714
00:42:43.996 --> 00:42:47.216
It's all right.
I'm gonna join your mother.

715
00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.349
No. Daddy. No.
you can't leave us.

716
00:42:49.392 --> 00:42:51.481
Look. he got bit and
he's okay.

717
00:42:51.525 --> 00:42:52.657
Maybe you'll be fine.

718
00:42:53.266 --> 00:42:55.181
[breathes shallowly]

719
00:42:56.835 --> 00:42:58.488
That's unlikely.

720
00:42:58.532 --> 00:43:02.101
It seems your crossbow works.

721
00:43:02.144 --> 00:43:03.189
Yeah.

722
00:43:03.972 --> 00:43:05.191
That's good to know.

723
00:43:06.409 --> 00:43:08.542
'Cause I think you got
another one to do.

724
00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:10.675
- [Elena] No.
- [breathes shallowly]

725
00:43:10.718 --> 00:43:11.719
I guess so.

726
00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.115
[strained] I've raised
two strong girls.

727
00:43:16.158 --> 00:43:18.030
who can take care
of themselves now.

728
00:43:19.379 --> 00:43:20.510
You can do it.

729
00:43:22.121 --> 00:43:23.775
[groaning]

730
00:43:28.083 --> 00:43:29.607
You hear me?

731
00:43:32.218 --> 00:43:33.611
[sniffles] Yes. Daddy.

732
00:43:34.307 --> 00:43:35.438
[Daddy] Let's do this.

733
00:43:36.439 --> 00:43:37.615
[groans]

734
00:43:41.793 --> 00:43:43.185
[sobbing]

735
00:43:44.186 --> 00:43:45.840
[Daddy groaning]

736
00:43:47.146 --> 00:43:48.190
Speak.

737
00:43:48.887 --> 00:43:51.498
Many of your followers
have yet to arrive.

738
00:43:51.541 --> 00:43:54.022
Do you wish us to start
search for them?

739
00:43:54.066 --> 00:43:59.158
I have no use for the weak.
unable to get here
by themselves.

740
00:43:59.201 --> 00:44:02.378
We are so few.
How can we possibly prevail?

741
00:44:04.511 --> 00:44:07.470
The whole world
has been ravaged.

742
00:44:08.428 --> 00:44:10.822
They will be facing
the same problems as us.

743
00:44:13.389 --> 00:44:14.434
Now. go.

744
00:44:15.087 --> 00:44:16.479
Trust in me.

745
00:44:16.523 --> 00:44:17.742
Yes. my lord.

746
00:44:19.569 --> 00:44:20.658
We've been talkin'.

747
00:44:20.701 --> 00:44:22.747
When you're leavin'.
we're comin' with.

748
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:24.444
I appreciate that.

749
00:44:26.141 --> 00:44:28.927
Those shells of yours
don't kill 'em.

750
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:30.798
but seem to slow 'em down.

751
00:44:30.842 --> 00:44:32.757
We'll get making some more.

752
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.149
Can I get some of those?

753
00:44:34.193 --> 00:44:35.455
Figure with my two barrels.

754
00:44:35.498 --> 00:44:36.761
I could blast 'em in the face.

755
00:44:36.804 --> 00:44:38.414
and blind 'em temporarily.

756
00:44:38.458 --> 00:44:39.502
Worth tryin'.

757
00:44:40.678 --> 00:44:42.070
Think I'll get my chance?

758
00:44:42.114 --> 00:44:43.724
I can guarantee that.

759
00:44:46.074 --> 00:44:48.511
I just can't guarantee
we're gonna live.

760
00:44:48.555 --> 00:44:52.559
Yeah. well. I'd rather take
my chances out there
than sit here and rot.

761
00:44:52.602 --> 00:44:54.735
Hell. John. I should've
been dead already.

762
00:44:55.344 --> 00:44:56.824
The way I look at it.

763
00:44:56.868 --> 00:44:58.652
any chance to kill
one of those things.

764
00:44:59.348 --> 00:45:00.393
I'm good.

765
00:45:00.436 --> 00:45:01.481
All right.

766
00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:04.136
Let's get some rest.

767
00:45:04.179 --> 00:45:06.399
Let's see what the militia's
got to say tomorrow.

768
00:45:37.256 --> 00:45:39.562
Hey. Be careful with them.

769
00:45:44.654 --> 00:45:46.874
- [car door slams]
- [bird squawks]

770
00:45:50.182 --> 00:45:51.270
You did this?

771
00:45:54.186 --> 00:45:56.231
- Yeah.
- Vampire?

772
00:45:56.275 --> 00:45:58.538
- Yep.
- I ain't buyin' that.

773
00:45:58.581 --> 00:46:00.845
Exactly. Bullshit.

774
00:46:01.497 --> 00:46:02.803
Check the teeth.

775
00:46:10.419 --> 00:46:11.769
It's for real.

776
00:46:11.812 --> 00:46:14.075
That don't mean nothin'.
Could've found him dead.

777
00:46:14.119 --> 00:46:16.425
Are you trying
to impress us?

778
00:46:16.469 --> 00:46:17.775
Maybe I am.

779
00:46:17.818 --> 00:46:19.559
- [Ryan] Well. it ain't workin'.
- [John] Pity.

780
00:46:20.168 --> 00:46:22.170
Could've used your help
to kill more of 'em.

781
00:46:22.214 --> 00:46:23.171
[LaCroix chuckles]

782
00:46:23.215 --> 00:46:24.303
Our help?

783
00:46:24.869 --> 00:46:26.087
What do you need
our help for?

784
00:46:26.131 --> 00:46:27.567
[bird squawks]

785
00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:29.177
I'm lookin' for the Master.

786
00:46:29.221 --> 00:46:31.876
[chuckles]
Good luck with that.

787
00:46:33.051 --> 00:46:35.531
I ain't going anywhere
near any Master.

788
00:46:35.575 --> 00:46:37.011
I just wanna find him.

789
00:46:37.925 --> 00:46:40.798
Big country.
Lot of ground to cover.

790
00:46:40.841 --> 00:46:43.235
I suppose you want us
to do all your lookin'?

791
00:46:43.278 --> 00:46:45.193
Like I said.
I could use the help.

792
00:46:46.238 --> 00:46:47.717
Why don't you tell your boss?

793
00:46:47.761 --> 00:46:49.371
He's not our boss!

794
00:46:49.415 --> 00:46:51.025
He's our captain!

795
00:46:51.634 --> 00:46:53.332
Well. then tell your captain.

796
00:46:53.375 --> 00:46:54.942
Might be worth his while.

797
00:46:54.986 --> 00:46:56.509
[laughs]

798
00:46:56.552 --> 00:46:59.077
Hey. honey! How about
you get those crates for us?

799
00:47:01.514 --> 00:47:03.211
So you're just passing
through. huh?

800
00:47:03.255 --> 00:47:04.691
Yep.

801
00:47:04.734 --> 00:47:07.259
You stick around.
you gotta start paying taxes.

802
00:47:07.999 --> 00:47:09.000
"Taxes."

803
00:47:13.221 --> 00:47:14.222
[chuckles]

804
00:47:15.049 --> 00:47:16.268
Nice.

805
00:47:18.923 --> 00:47:20.838
- Your bike?
- Yes. sir.

806
00:47:22.361 --> 00:47:25.016
Really. I can-- I can get you
a good deal on that.

807
00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:27.540
I'm good. man.
Thank you.

808
00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:30.760
Oh. you sure?

809
00:47:30.804 --> 00:47:32.893
Get you water. food.

810
00:47:33.676 --> 00:47:34.721
Vehicle.

811
00:47:35.374 --> 00:47:37.332
Plenty of fuel
to roll with.

812
00:47:37.376 --> 00:47:39.595
I am not interested.

813
00:47:40.292 --> 00:47:41.336
Thank you.

814
00:47:44.165 --> 00:47:46.080
Why don't you think
about that. hm?

815
00:47:46.124 --> 00:47:47.125
Okay.

816
00:47:48.474 --> 00:47:50.084
But it's still
not for sale.

817
00:47:51.259 --> 00:47:52.304
You know.

818
00:47:53.522 --> 00:47:55.046
I'm startin'
not to like you.

819
00:48:00.486 --> 00:48:03.706
Why don't you just
not be here
when I get back?

820
00:48:13.238 --> 00:48:15.501
[bottles clinking]

821
00:48:15.544 --> 00:48:17.416
Don't. It won't help.

822
00:48:18.939 --> 00:48:21.986
[bottles clinking]

823
00:48:34.128 --> 00:48:35.129
[blows a kiss]

824
00:48:38.567 --> 00:48:40.221
Where's your daddy?

825
00:48:40.787 --> 00:48:42.049
Busy.

826
00:48:42.093 --> 00:48:43.442
Had somethin' to do.

827
00:48:43.485 --> 00:48:46.227
Is that right?

828
00:48:46.271 --> 00:48:49.274
Is this your new boyfriend?

829
00:48:49.317 --> 00:48:50.449
You look a little
disappointed.

830
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.800
You best make sure
he gets that message.

831
00:48:53.843 --> 00:48:55.497
[laughs]

832
00:48:55.541 --> 00:48:56.672
I will!

833
00:48:56.716 --> 00:48:58.196
Just don't hold your breath!

834
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:06.682
You sure you know
what you're doin'?

835
00:49:07.292 --> 00:49:09.120
I'm wingin' it as usual.

836
00:49:09.163 --> 00:49:11.078
[Brooke] How long
you gonna wait for 'em?

837
00:49:11.122 --> 00:49:12.688
I can wait two days.

838
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.648
He's close.

839
00:49:17.302 --> 00:49:18.825
I'm feeling
he's getting stronger.

840
00:49:20.827 --> 00:49:23.047
[tense music playing]

841
00:49:27.094 --> 00:49:28.095
[bottles clink]

842
00:49:33.274 --> 00:49:34.275
He's comin'.

843
00:49:36.147 --> 00:49:37.148
"He's comin'?"

844
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.411
That sounds like an army.

845
00:49:43.763 --> 00:49:46.679
[engine roars]

846
00:50:26.458 --> 00:50:27.415
[chuckles]

847
00:50:42.822 --> 00:50:44.476
Okay. vampire hunter.

848
00:50:44.519 --> 00:50:46.695
You got me interested.
Let's go talk.

849
00:50:47.566 --> 00:50:50.917
So. how have you been doin'
out here. alone?

850
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.094
Still think you don't need
any. uh. companionship?

851
00:50:54.703 --> 00:50:56.401
You better watch your mouth.

852
00:50:57.532 --> 00:51:00.622
I'll cut your balls off
and feed 'em to your little pet.

853
00:51:00.666 --> 00:51:03.190
Yeah. I. uh.
I don't need that.

854
00:51:03.234 --> 00:51:06.585
but I'm sure Shelton here
can handle you.

855
00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:10.893
I like it rough.
Think your sister here
would go for it?

856
00:51:10.937 --> 00:51:13.070
- Hey. that's enough. boys.
- [metal clanks]

857
00:51:14.288 --> 00:51:15.420
Y'all need to move on.

858
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:18.510
You gonna take us
all on yourself?

859
00:51:18.553 --> 00:51:19.815
If I have to.

860
00:51:19.859 --> 00:51:21.817
I should just
shoot you right now.

861
00:51:21.861 --> 00:51:25.734
Yeah. you could.
but I don't think you have
the authority. fuck face.

862
00:51:26.344 --> 00:51:28.868
Think you need to go ask
your little boss up there.

863
00:51:28.911 --> 00:51:29.869
Sheep.

864
00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.614
I need you two to get those men
away from the women.

865
00:51:36.658 --> 00:51:37.833
Seems fine to me.

866
00:51:37.877 --> 00:51:39.400
Do it.

867
00:51:39.444 --> 00:51:41.620
Doesn't seem a problem.
Maybe we should ask Torque.

868
00:51:41.663 --> 00:51:44.405
You don't need to talk to him.
I gave you an order.

869
00:51:44.449 --> 00:51:45.580
We'll wait.

870
00:51:46.929 --> 00:51:49.367
I don't see Torque interfering
with a little fun.

871
00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:53.110
Okay. boys!
You need to calm down.

872
00:51:54.285 --> 00:51:55.503
I am calm.

873
00:51:55.547 --> 00:51:57.026
Oh. that's real good.

874
00:51:57.984 --> 00:52:01.770
'Cause last time I checked.
we all had a common enemy.

875
00:52:01.814 --> 00:52:04.773
The vampires.
You remember them. huh?

876
00:52:05.383 --> 00:52:07.167
While you're all busy arguing.

877
00:52:07.211 --> 00:52:10.127
they're gonna sneak up
behind you and bleed your ass.

878
00:52:10.823 --> 00:52:13.782
Jesus! I wasn't talking
right now. you goddamn idiot!

879
00:52:13.826 --> 00:52:15.349
I was talking metaphorically.

880
00:52:15.393 --> 00:52:17.221
Let's go before
they get rapey again.

881
00:52:17.917 --> 00:52:19.353
Impressive.

882
00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:22.269
I'm glad you like it.

883
00:52:22.878 --> 00:52:24.619
What do you need us for?

884
00:52:24.663 --> 00:52:26.708
[John] There's a lot
of terrain out there.

885
00:52:26.752 --> 00:52:28.449
I assume you know it well.

886
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:32.279
I'd appreciate it if your men
could help me track him down.

887
00:52:32.975 --> 00:52:36.544
Why would I help you?

888
00:52:37.676 --> 00:52:39.765
When I kill the Master.

889
00:52:39.808 --> 00:52:42.159
this country's gonna need
somebody to take care of it.

890
00:52:43.899 --> 00:52:46.424
It seems to me
that you're the man to do that.

891
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:49.253
This world needs order.

892
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:53.300
Tell you what.
You hang around here.

893
00:52:53.909 --> 00:52:56.869
I'll be back
within two days.

894
00:52:56.912 --> 00:52:59.176
I believe that would be good.

895
00:52:59.219 --> 00:53:01.917
If he's within 100 miles
of this place.

896
00:53:01.961 --> 00:53:03.441
we'll find him for you.

897
00:53:07.575 --> 00:53:08.794
What happened?

898
00:53:08.837 --> 00:53:11.188
They're behaving
like pigs. like usual.

899
00:53:12.493 --> 00:53:13.668
I didn't see nothin'.

900
00:53:13.712 --> 00:53:14.974
All I saw was a bunch of guys

901
00:53:15.017 --> 00:53:16.367
makin' polite conversation.

902
00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:17.411
Yeah.

903
00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:19.631
You stay away from them.

904
00:53:19.674 --> 00:53:21.546
If you ask me.
she's too sensitive.

905
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:22.851
She's been on her own
too long.

906
00:53:22.895 --> 00:53:24.940
Well. I ain't asking you.

907
00:53:24.984 --> 00:53:26.986
and it seems like
you've been alone too long.

908
00:53:27.029 --> 00:53:29.423
Maybe you should let things
work out the way they should.

909
00:53:29.467 --> 00:53:31.817
I'd be very careful.
if I was you.

910
00:53:36.735 --> 00:53:38.389
I apologize
for my friends here.

911
00:53:39.085 --> 00:53:41.609
They're the sheep
that has lost their shepherd.

912
00:53:41.653 --> 00:53:44.482
Mm. Maybe you need
new friends.

913
00:53:44.525 --> 00:53:45.961
Yo! Let's go!

914
00:53:46.962 --> 00:53:48.225
Take care.

915
00:53:48.268 --> 00:53:49.791
You too. vampire hunter.

916
00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:57.234
Do you trust him?

917
00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:00.498
Nope.

918
00:54:01.107 --> 00:54:03.718
but I gave him the best deal
he's ever gonna get.

919
00:54:03.762 --> 00:54:05.590
That man's gonna be
trouble. John.

920
00:54:06.504 --> 00:54:08.157
That's what I thought
about you.

921
00:54:09.507 --> 00:54:11.117
But I'm afraid
you may be right.

922
00:54:17.863 --> 00:54:20.779
I have arrived.
I am Nosferatu.

923
00:54:22.041 --> 00:54:24.913
[sighs] Yes.
we can see that.

924
00:54:24.957 --> 00:54:26.480
I need to speak
to the Queen.

925
00:54:27.351 --> 00:54:29.309
We will let her know
you have arrived.

926
00:54:29.353 --> 00:54:32.181
I must speak to the Queen.
It is important.

927
00:54:34.183 --> 00:54:35.141
Wait.

928
00:54:35.837 --> 00:54:37.883
If she wishes to speak to you.
she will come.

929
00:54:40.712 --> 00:54:41.756
You.

930
00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.931
Speak.

931
00:54:43.715 --> 00:54:45.064
Where are the rest?

932
00:54:45.107 --> 00:54:47.066
My Queen.
they're scattered.

933
00:54:47.719 --> 00:54:49.155
I know not where.

934
00:54:50.896 --> 00:54:52.201
[snarls]

935
00:54:53.899 --> 00:54:55.553
[growls]

936
00:54:56.684 --> 00:54:59.252
Who is this that demands
an audience with my Queen?

937
00:54:59.861 --> 00:55:01.428
I've seen
the dead bodies.

938
00:55:02.473 --> 00:55:05.432
I can attest
to his existence.

939
00:55:06.346 --> 00:55:08.783
We are both aware
of the hunter.

940
00:55:10.742 --> 00:55:12.134
Now go rest.

941
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:29.413
[Williams] Looks kinda quiet.

942
00:55:29.456 --> 00:55:31.066
[Johnston]
What were you expecting?

943
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:33.373
I don't know. Doesn't look like
there's anybody here.

944
00:55:33.417 --> 00:55:34.679
You think there'd be somethin'.

945
00:55:34.722 --> 00:55:36.028
Take a drive down
that main street.

946
00:55:36.071 --> 00:55:37.856
You spot anyone.
vampire or not.

947
00:55:37.899 --> 00:55:39.336
hit the goddamn gas.

948
00:55:39.379 --> 00:55:40.424
Ah. crap.

949
00:55:40.989 --> 00:55:42.948
I can guarantee
I'll be doing that.

950
00:55:42.991 --> 00:55:44.515
We should've
brought bayonets.

951
00:55:44.558 --> 00:55:46.212
Might give us
a fighting chance.

952
00:55:46.255 --> 00:55:48.040
Should we aim our guns
out the window?

953
00:55:48.083 --> 00:55:49.433
It's not gonna work.

954
00:55:49.476 --> 00:55:51.217
It might be something.

955
00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.262
I need every chance
we can get!

956
00:55:54.438 --> 00:55:56.178
How many vampires
have you approached?

957
00:55:56.222 --> 00:55:58.616
None. and I'm hoping
to keep it that way.

958
00:55:58.659 --> 00:56:01.488
Uh-huh. so you got
no better idea
than we do on this.

959
00:56:01.532 --> 00:56:03.055
I know what to do.

960
00:56:03.751 --> 00:56:05.405
[Lambert] I wish I had my knife.

961
00:56:05.449 --> 00:56:07.668
We should've spent last night
carving stakes.

962
00:56:07.712 --> 00:56:09.366
They said they tried it.
Now quiet.

963
00:56:11.019 --> 00:56:12.325
Head down the main street.

964
00:56:12.369 --> 00:56:14.458
Keep the engine revs
as low as possible.

965
00:56:14.501 --> 00:56:16.111
We don't wanna draw
any attention to ourselves.

966
00:56:16.155 --> 00:56:17.199
All right.

967
00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:27.862
[suspenseful music playing]

968
00:56:40.092 --> 00:56:42.181
So. we checked it out.
Should we go now?

969
00:56:42.224 --> 00:56:45.097
We can't. Torque will ask us
if we checked inside
these buildings.

970
00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:47.142
So. we lie.
Screw all that.

971
00:56:47.882 --> 00:56:49.231
We can't lie.

972
00:56:49.275 --> 00:56:51.625
Torque will ask us
if we checked these buildings.

973
00:56:51.669 --> 00:56:54.236
What if they are in there?
They'll kill us.

974
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.716
We'll leave
the car doors open.

975
00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.283
We'll kick in the doors
of these buildings.

976
00:56:57.326 --> 00:56:59.416
We see anybody.
jump back in the car
and we're gone.

977
00:57:00.721 --> 00:57:02.114
[door thuds]

978
00:57:03.681 --> 00:57:05.291
[pants]

979
00:57:21.176 --> 00:57:22.700

[groans. screams]

982
00:57:29.271 --> 00:57:30.708
Hey. where's Lambert?

983
00:57:30.751 --> 00:57:31.926
I don't know.
I wasn't watching!

984
00:57:32.536 --> 00:57:33.667
- [vampire snarls]
- [screams]

985
00:57:33.711 --> 00:57:34.973
He's dead!

986
00:57:35.016 --> 00:57:36.409
[Johnston] Shit.
get us outta here!

987
00:57:36.453 --> 00:57:37.932
[grunts]

988
00:57:37.976 --> 00:57:41.675
Hey! Hey!
Where you goin'?

989
00:57:41.719 --> 00:57:43.285
There's no escaping.

990
00:57:43.329 --> 00:57:44.678
- [screams]
- [snarls]

991
00:57:46.419 --> 00:57:48.595
[door thuds. creaks]

992
00:58:03.001 --> 00:58:04.481
[laughs]

993
00:58:05.264 --> 00:58:07.005
That doesn't work for me.

994
00:58:09.181 --> 00:58:12.314
- [Johnston pants]
- [gun clicks]

995
00:58:12.358 --> 00:58:13.881
[gun clatters]

996
00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:18.930
[snarls]

997
00:58:20.105 --> 00:58:21.323
What are you doing here?

998
00:58:21.367 --> 00:58:22.977
Please. I don't wanna die.

999
00:58:23.021 --> 00:58:25.066
You're not going to die.

1000
00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:26.503
Now. tell me.

1001
00:58:27.155 --> 00:58:29.157
What are you doing here?

1002
00:58:29.201 --> 00:58:32.421
Vampire hunter.
he sent us.
He's nearby.

1003
00:58:35.337 --> 00:58:36.513
So he's coming.

1004
00:58:37.949 --> 00:58:39.472
You want me to send him
a message?

1005
00:58:40.081 --> 00:58:41.430
Yes.

1006
00:58:41.474 --> 00:58:44.129
I would love
to send him a message.

1007
00:58:45.957 --> 00:58:47.654
[chuckles]

1008
00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:52.398
I said you will live.
You will live...

1009
00:58:53.573 --> 00:58:55.619
- Forever.
- [laughs]

1010
00:58:55.662 --> 00:58:57.577
[growls]

1011
00:58:57.621 --> 00:59:00.188
- [Johnston screams]
- [Master growls]

1012
00:59:08.022 --> 00:59:10.111
It's Johnston.
Looks like he's been bitten.

1013
00:59:11.156 --> 00:59:12.200
Keep goin'.

1014
00:59:16.596 --> 00:59:18.206
He was a good man!

1015
00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:20.948
He deserves better than just
being left out here to turn.

1016
00:59:21.645 --> 00:59:23.647
We'll let the vampire hunter
come and deal with him later.

1017
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:24.822
He's not going anywhere.

1018
00:59:26.867 --> 00:59:28.216
You see. there you go.

1019
00:59:28.913 --> 00:59:30.479
You know. you'll never be
a great leader

1020
00:59:30.523 --> 00:59:32.699
if you worry about
the loss of every soldier.

1021
00:59:32.743 --> 00:59:34.353
This is fuckin' war. you know.

1022
00:59:36.094 --> 00:59:37.748
[driver] We're almost
there now. sir.

1023
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.402
- Pull over.
- [driver] All right.

1024
01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:03.774
Let 'em know we're here.

1025
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:07.691
[horn honks]

1026
01:00:07.734 --> 01:00:09.040
I'm gonna go check things out.

1027
01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:10.737
You guys stay here.

1028
01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.439
I sure hope he knows
what he's doing.

1029
01:00:20.747 --> 01:00:22.575
[Destias] What on earth?

1030
01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:26.710
Are there still such
stupid people left alive?

1031
01:00:26.753 --> 01:00:28.015
I need to see it.

1032
01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:36.937
It could be a trap.

1033
01:00:37.851 --> 01:00:39.070
You still want to go?

1034
01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:41.507
Of course not. my lord.

1035
01:00:42.203 --> 01:00:45.729
I was just trying to serve you
as best as I could.

1036
01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:54.259
I...

1037
01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:58.611
I have never met anyone
wanting to die.

1038
01:00:59.264 --> 01:01:01.570
as badly as you.

1039
01:01:02.528 --> 01:01:03.790
I'm here to see your master.

1040
01:01:04.399 --> 01:01:07.359
You assume I am not the Master.

1041
01:01:07.402 --> 01:01:09.056
I doubt that.

1042
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.972
We all know the boss is never
the first to show his face.

1043
01:01:12.016 --> 01:01:14.671
I got a feeling you guys
are not too high up
on the totem pole.

1044
01:01:14.714 --> 01:01:16.107
Careful.

1045
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:18.805
I could kill you so quickly.

1046
01:01:20.285 --> 01:01:21.590
Wait here.

1047
01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:27.074
Coming here like this
is unexpected.

1048
01:01:28.032 --> 01:01:32.210
You are either very brave.
or very foolish.

1049
01:01:32.253 --> 01:01:34.255
I figure it's a risk
I'm willing to take.

1050
01:01:36.127 --> 01:01:38.390
What has happened
out there?

1051
01:01:38.433 --> 01:01:41.306
A human would like
to speak to you.

1052
01:01:42.089 --> 01:01:43.612
Send him in.

1053
01:01:43.656 --> 01:01:45.745
Yes. my lord.

1054
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:48.835
[laughs]

1055
01:01:50.271 --> 01:01:52.709
[coughing]

1056
01:01:55.363 --> 01:01:57.844
- [coughing continues]
- [snarls]

1057
01:01:57.888 --> 01:01:59.106
Pardon. pardon me.

1058
01:02:01.239 --> 01:02:03.981
I. um... I come
to make a deal.

1059
01:02:06.766 --> 01:02:08.115
There's a vampire hunter.

1060
01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:11.858
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. Whoa. now.

1061
01:02:12.467 --> 01:02:14.861
I'd appreciate it if you kept
your distance. For real.

1062
01:02:16.907 --> 01:02:19.823
Very well.
But it won't save you.

1063
01:02:20.519 --> 01:02:22.129
You've got one minute.

1064
01:02:23.304 --> 01:02:26.220
There's a vampire hunter.
He's looking for you.

1065
01:02:28.048 --> 01:02:31.617
But I can bring him to you.

1066
01:02:33.488 --> 01:02:34.925
And in return?

1067
01:02:35.534 --> 01:02:36.578
Well. uh...

1068
01:02:37.362 --> 01:02:39.320
At the rate you guys are goin'.

1069
01:02:39.364 --> 01:02:40.844
you're gonna run out
of people real soon.

1070
01:02:42.106 --> 01:02:44.499
Put me in charge
of the surviving humans.

1071
01:02:44.543 --> 01:02:46.110
Let us rebuild
the population.

1072
01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:51.376
They're too afraid
to deal with you.

1073
01:02:51.419 --> 01:02:52.638
but they'll listen to me.

1074
01:02:58.992 --> 01:03:00.037
Bring him to me.

1075
01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:01.734
Go.

1076
01:03:02.822 --> 01:03:05.303
[snarls]

1077
01:03:16.096 --> 01:03:17.924
What the hell
just happened over there?

1078
01:03:18.533 --> 01:03:19.578
I made a deal.

1079
01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:21.536
- With him?
- That's right.

1080
01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.974
Look. we gotta be
on the winning side of this.

1081
01:03:24.626 --> 01:03:27.455
- You sold out the human race.
- Sold 'em out?

1082
01:03:27.499 --> 01:03:30.371
You think that vampire hunter's
gonna save us all?

1083
01:03:30.415 --> 01:03:32.678
He kills one
freshly turned vamp.

1084
01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:34.898
and you wanna make him
your savior. hallelujah!

1085
01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:37.074
- But shouldn't we let him try?
- No.

1086
01:03:37.117 --> 01:03:40.077
This is a great opportunity.
We can run this country.

1087
01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.950
All we gotta do is supply
the Master with enough.
um. enough bodies.

1088
01:03:43.994 --> 01:03:45.778
[chuckles] Oh.
Oh. is that all?

1089
01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.433
That's all.
Look. after all this.

1090
01:03:48.476 --> 01:03:50.957
and you still don't understand
how this world works now?

1091
01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:53.568
See. that's why you'll
never be a great leader.

1092
01:03:53.612 --> 01:03:56.441
and exactly why I am.
Let's go.

1093
01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:07.408
[snarling]

1094
01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:11.151
This is all you bring me?

1095
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.850
All I could find.
my Queen.

1096
01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:15.852
There are many empty towns.

1097
01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:18.637
with next to nothing
between them.

1098
01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.118
We have traveled a long way.

1099
01:04:21.161 --> 01:04:24.121
with nothing to sustain us.

1100
01:04:24.164 --> 01:04:25.905
We desire blood.

1101
01:04:27.254 --> 01:04:28.647
Well. there's none here.

1102
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:32.172
When we leave.
we shall find some.

1103
01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:34.261
You don't seem hungry.

1104
01:04:35.306 --> 01:04:38.918
And your breath
is most fragrant.
as if you've just fed.

1105
01:04:39.527 --> 01:04:42.661
Unless my senses deceive me
after our difficult...

1106
01:04:42.704 --> 01:04:44.619
[snarling]

1107
01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:48.972
Do you accuse
our Queen of lying?

1108
01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:51.017
No. no.

1109
01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:55.065
And if it seems that way.
please forgive me.

1110
01:04:55.108 --> 01:04:58.677
Once we feed.
we'll be more civil.

1111
01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.983
We will find some.

1112
01:05:00.679 --> 01:05:03.856
but for now. we stay.

1113
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.771
Stay? Why?

1114
01:05:06.772 --> 01:05:09.601
The battle is upon us.
We should go.

1115
01:05:09.644 --> 01:05:11.429
There is a hunter coming.

1116
01:05:12.256 --> 01:05:14.562
When he dies. we go.

1117
01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:18.610
What human requires
all of us to kill him?

1118
01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:21.874
One of us can stay.
That should be enough.

1119
01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.442
The Master wants
to do it personally.

1120
01:05:24.485 --> 01:05:27.924
Then he can stay
and rest of us can move on.

1121
01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:30.927
We can leave this barren
wasteland behind.

1122
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.626
The Master wants us all to stay.

1123
01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:36.628
Where is the Master?

1124
01:05:37.672 --> 01:05:42.590
He is resting.
just like you should be.
after your long journey.

1125
01:05:42.634 --> 01:05:44.027
We wish to speak with him.

1126
01:05:45.332 --> 01:05:46.725
We will not keep him long.

1127
01:05:47.508 --> 01:05:49.075
Maybe we should disturb him.

1128
01:05:49.119 --> 01:05:52.252
I'm sure he would be
overjoyed to see you.

1129
01:05:52.296 --> 01:05:55.342
[snarls]

1130
01:05:55.386 --> 01:05:57.431
Go! Go rest.

1131
01:05:57.475 --> 01:05:59.956
There are many things
to be discussed.

1132
01:05:59.999 --> 01:06:02.654
Mm. There are more
of you coming.

1133
01:06:02.697 --> 01:06:05.657
When they arrive. we talk.

1134
01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:07.876
When?

1135
01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.617
[snarls]

1136
01:06:09.661 --> 01:06:13.317
When your Queen decides.
and not before.

1137
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.101
[growls]

1138
01:06:15.145 --> 01:06:16.798
- Go!
- [growls]

1139
01:06:19.279 --> 01:06:21.673
We have traveled
all this way.

1140
01:06:22.456 --> 01:06:24.676
Treated like slaves.

1141
01:06:24.719 --> 01:06:28.854
And yet we're forbidden to enter
the Master's house?

1142
01:06:28.897 --> 01:06:30.421
They were there.

1143
01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:32.379
I could smell them.

1144
01:06:33.728 --> 01:06:35.426
I smelled the blood
on her breath.

1145
01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:37.210
They are there.

1146
01:06:38.168 --> 01:06:40.170
But it has been decided
they are not for us.

1147
01:06:41.388 --> 01:06:44.913
We're kept outside
and starved like dogs?

1148
01:06:44.957 --> 01:06:47.307
We should threaten to leave.

1149
01:06:47.351 --> 01:06:50.354
That will bring
the Master to us.

1150
01:06:50.397 --> 01:06:53.618
It will also bring
with it his wrath.

1151
01:06:54.401 --> 01:06:57.361
She cannot keep us
from the Master forever.

1152
01:07:00.451 --> 01:07:01.539
[chair creaks]

1153
01:07:02.714 --> 01:07:04.194
Rest now.

1154
01:07:10.287 --> 01:07:11.853
[crickets chirping]

1155
01:07:11.897 --> 01:07:13.029
Careful.

1156
01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:16.510
Great news.
vampire hunter.

1157
01:07:17.163 --> 01:07:19.774
- You found them?
- Well. uh. not exactly.

1158
01:07:19.818 --> 01:07:21.820
But three of my guys
went into an old ghost town

1159
01:07:21.863 --> 01:07:24.301
not too far from here.
only one came back.

1160
01:07:24.344 --> 01:07:26.738
I think it's safe to say
we found your spot.

1161
01:07:27.347 --> 01:07:30.263
Now. what we need to do
is pack everybody up.

1162
01:07:30.307 --> 01:07:33.310
we head down there
and we kick
some bloodsucker ass.

1163
01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:36.574
Well. wouldn't it be best
if we went tomorrow morning?

1164
01:07:36.617 --> 01:07:38.010
They're strongest at night.

1165
01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.882
Well. uh. see.
that's the beauty of the plan.

1166
01:07:41.883 --> 01:07:43.320
Won't be expecting us.

1167
01:07:44.582 --> 01:07:46.279
Don't mind Mr. Rico.

1168
01:07:47.237 --> 01:07:48.238
He's loyal.

1169
01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:50.718
That's a good word. right?

1170
01:07:51.763 --> 01:07:52.894
I best get ready.

1171
01:07:54.548 --> 01:07:55.593
Stay cool. Rico.

1172
01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.075
Loyal dogs get put down. man.

1173
01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.563
Somethin' isn't right.

1174
01:08:09.607 --> 01:08:11.217
You're gonna have
to sit this one out.

1175
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.263
What's the matter?

1176
01:08:13.306 --> 01:08:15.395
Our friends out there
have the look of guilt.

1177
01:08:15.439 --> 01:08:17.963
They can't be selling you out.
That makes no sense.

1178
01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:19.878
Maybe not.
but after we're gone.

1179
01:08:19.921 --> 01:08:22.489
you pack and head
in the opposite direction.

1180
01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.317
No. no way.

1181
01:08:24.361 --> 01:08:26.841
I told you we were going
to help and we are.

1182
01:08:26.885 --> 01:08:28.452
You know this ghost town?

1183
01:08:29.192 --> 01:08:31.063
I reckon I know
what he's talking about.

1184
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:33.457
You give me two hours.

1185
01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:35.676
then get there unseen.

1186
01:08:37.635 --> 01:08:39.027
If what you say is true.

1187
01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.682
it could be
all over with by then.

1188
01:08:41.726 --> 01:08:43.858
That's a chance
we're gonna have to take.

1189
01:08:46.426 --> 01:08:47.427
[sighs]

1190
01:08:49.342 --> 01:08:51.475
When this is over.
we're gonna run this country!

1191
01:08:51.518 --> 01:08:52.867
[militia] Yeah!

1192
01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:55.043
- No more vampire problems!
- [militia cheers]

1193
01:08:55.087 --> 01:08:56.871
You know what I'm sayin'?
You know what I'm sayin'?

1194
01:08:56.915 --> 01:08:59.309
- This is gonna be
our country now!
- [militia] Yeah!

1195
01:08:59.352 --> 01:09:02.703
- We will be in charge!
- [militia] Yeah!

1196
01:09:02.747 --> 01:09:06.011
- And we will run
the human race!
- [militia] Yeah!

1197
01:09:06.054 --> 01:09:07.534
And we're here to join you.

1198
01:09:08.622 --> 01:09:10.711
Oh. yeah. About that.

1199
01:09:12.409 --> 01:09:14.367
- Take 'em.
- What--

1200
01:09:17.501 --> 01:09:18.632
Get the women too.

1201
01:09:19.807 --> 01:09:21.896
- Why the women? You said--
- Man. shut your ass up!

1202
01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:23.028
But you said...

1203
01:09:28.686 --> 01:09:31.254
You asshole.

1204
01:09:31.297 --> 01:09:34.126
That I am. Tie 'em up.

1205
01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.475
[grunts]

1206
01:09:35.519 --> 01:09:38.913
Rico. Charlie. Relax.

1207
01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.180
If he gives you
any more problems.
put a bullet in his head.

1208
01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:48.096
Loyal dogs get put down.

1209
01:09:49.924 --> 01:09:50.969
[lighter flicks]

1210
01:09:52.797 --> 01:09:54.407
I had faith in you.

1211
01:09:55.016 --> 01:09:57.280
Make me understand
why you betrayed me.

1212
01:09:58.106 --> 01:10:00.239
Because I don't have faith
in you. vampire hunter.

1213
01:10:02.459 --> 01:10:05.462
I've seen the Master
and you can't beat him.

1214
01:10:06.724 --> 01:10:08.987
And besides.
I kinda got this thing.

1215
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.642
I like being
on the winning side.

1216
01:10:13.861 --> 01:10:15.211
At what cost?

1217
01:10:15.907 --> 01:10:16.951
Your soul?

1218
01:10:18.388 --> 01:10:19.650
Please.

1219
01:10:19.693 --> 01:10:21.086
Bought and paid for.

1220
01:10:21.129 --> 01:10:22.392
A long time ago.

1221
01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:24.524
That's why I'm still here.

1222
01:10:26.396 --> 01:10:27.832
Can't argue with that.

1223
01:10:32.924 --> 01:10:34.142
I brought you
what I promised.

1224
01:10:34.926 --> 01:10:35.970
And some.

1225
01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.104
[snarls] Send him over.

1226
01:10:39.844 --> 01:10:40.932
[fingers snap]

1227
01:10:45.415 --> 01:10:46.851
[tense music playing]

1228
01:11:00.604 --> 01:11:03.520
[chain clinks]

1229
01:11:06.479 --> 01:11:07.393
John.

1230
01:11:09.961 --> 01:11:11.528
All that you've been through.

1231
01:11:13.399 --> 01:11:14.792
all that you've seen...

1232
01:11:17.925 --> 01:11:19.492
and you still believe?

1233
01:11:22.452 --> 01:11:23.931
How is that reasonable?

1234
01:11:25.716 --> 01:11:27.021
Are you judging me.

1235
01:11:28.066 --> 01:11:29.285
or my faith?

1236
01:11:30.851 --> 01:11:33.985
You carry the faith
of an empire

1237
01:11:36.335 --> 01:11:40.470
that has murdered every
single one of its prophets.

1238
01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:43.777
And if you persist. John.

1239
01:11:45.126 --> 01:11:46.563
it'll be the same for you.

1240
01:11:48.826 --> 01:11:51.219
This isn't going
to be quick. my friend.

1241
01:11:52.177 --> 01:11:55.615
Every day. you'll grow
weaker and weaker.

1242
01:11:56.834 --> 01:11:59.097
until you no longer care
if you live or die.

1243
01:12:02.056 --> 01:12:03.710
And die you will.

1244
01:12:03.754 --> 01:12:05.625
Not so confident.
are you now. Hunter?

1245
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:06.800
Be silent!

1246
01:12:09.194 --> 01:12:11.109
Does it hurt you so much

1247
01:12:12.676 --> 01:12:14.330
that I've chosen to live?

1248
01:12:18.986 --> 01:12:21.380
Having a bad day today. are we?

1249
01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:23.382

Yeah. whatever.

1252
01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:28.953

1254
01:12:34.132 --> 01:12:35.960
Your mom was a sweet ride.

1255
01:12:40.834 --> 01:12:42.270
Put him in the cellar.

1256
01:12:46.449 --> 01:12:47.754
You can have
this one as well.

1257
01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.626
What do you think
you're doing?

1258
01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:53.412
This is wrong!
This is all wrong
and you know it!

1259
01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:56.154
This man is our only hope
for survival!

1260
01:12:56.763 --> 01:12:58.374
False hope. you mean.

1261
01:13:01.594 --> 01:13:02.726
Keep him alive.

1262
01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:05.206
As long as he doesn't do
anything stupid.

1263
01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:07.078
No matter what.

1264
01:13:12.083 --> 01:13:13.345
My lord.

1265
01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.347
We should finish them now.

1266
01:13:16.087 --> 01:13:17.654
They are too great a risk.

1267
01:13:17.697 --> 01:13:19.699
Especially the hunter.

1268
01:13:21.048 --> 01:13:22.310
