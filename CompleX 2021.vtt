Uwe Mundlos and Beate Zschäpe.

11
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.995
United in a hate-filled and racist conspiracy

with like-minded comrades from across the country.

00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:32.122
This was Germany's neo-Nazi scene.

many in the East.

20
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.189
They were targeted by the neo-Nazis.

21
00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.087
and some fanatics went beyond arson.

22
00:01:58.087 --> 00:02:00.348
(gun fires)

23
00:02:00.348 --> 00:02:04.265

He was once a key leader of the neo-Nazis scene

26
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.577
in Thüringer.

Uwe Böhnhardt returned to Jena. Lobeda where he grew up.

33
00:04:25.947 --> 00:04:29.630
He soon hooked up with Beate Zschäpe from a nearby town.

34
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.085
and Uwe Mundlos.

35
00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:33.009
When the old authority collapsed.

36
00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.058
both old and neo-Nazis made a grab for power in Jena.

37
00:04:37.058 --> 00:04:40.975
(speaking in foreign language)

38
00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:32.790

(rioters screaming)

41
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.063
In late 1992. neo-Nazis torched two residential buildings

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:46.840
in the town of Mölln. three Turks.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.893
including two little girls perished in the flames.

44
00:07:49.893 --> 00:07:51.560
A few months later.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.707
five people were killed when Nazi set fire

46
00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:55.800
to a house in Solingen.

The Domestic Intelligence Agency.

00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:07.351
tasked with protecting the country against right-wing terror

50
00:08:07.351 --> 00:08:09.110
was growing concerned.

51
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.653
The situation was getting out of control.

52
00:08:12.912 --> 00:08:16.829
(speaking in foreign language)

53
00:08:26.563 --> 00:08:29.792
Right-wing terror was not new to Germany.

54
00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:33.087
In 1980. Obama designated at the October Fest.

55
00:08:33.087 --> 00:08:35.350
killing 13 innocent people.

56
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.237
The suspect was known to have trained

57
00:08:37.237 --> 00:08:41.254
with the right-wing paramilitary (indistinct)

58
00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:44.829
a group already infiltrated by several government informers.

59
00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:48.675
In the 1970s. one informer participated in bombing attacks

60
00:08:48.675 --> 00:08:50.847
on U.S targets in Germany.

61
00:08:50.847 --> 00:08:53.878
but authorities continued to rely on them.

62
00:08:53.878 --> 00:08:57.795
(speaking in foreign language)

63
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.268
Domestic Intelligence wanted more informers.

64
00:09:14.268 --> 00:09:18.185
(speaking in foreign language)

65
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.834
The use of informers in the radical scene.

66
00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:28.718
is extremely dangerous.

67
00:09:28.718 --> 00:09:30.685
They carry a load on two shoulders.

68
00:09:30.685 --> 00:09:34.241
and no one can ever be sure where they really stand.

69
00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:35.531
They belong.

70
00:09:35.531 --> 00:09:36.901
They cooperate.

71
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:38.100
They betray.

72
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.290
Some government informers. such as neo-Nazi Ralph Misener.

73
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.567
actually participated in an arson attack

74
00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:46.573
on refugee residences.

75
00:09:46.573 --> 00:09:49.356
At the time. he was a leader of a skinhead group.

76
00:09:49.356 --> 00:09:51.850
that set fire to the building.

77
00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.307
Yet still. he became a paid government informer

78
00:09:54.307 --> 00:09:56.370
of Domestic Intelligence.

79
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.287
(speaking in foreign language)

80
00:10:39.463 --> 00:10:42.779
One of the first informers recruited in the early 90s.

81
00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:44.922
was soon to deliver results.

82
00:10:44.922 --> 00:10:48.333
His name was Thomas Richter. codenamed Corelli.

83
00:10:48.333 --> 00:10:52.350
and he met Uwe Mundlos in the military in 1995

84
00:10:53.316 --> 00:10:56.650
Corelli reported that Mundlos helped establish a group

85
00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.920
of neo-Nazis in Jena.

86
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.210
And from then on. Domestic Intelligence had a source

87
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.408
on Mundlos and his activities.

88
00:11:05.408 --> 00:11:09.325
(speaking in foreign language)

89
00:11:26.702 --> 00:11:29.679
Neo-Nazis in both East and West often celebrate

90
00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:33.490
the anniversary of the death of Hitler's deputy. Rudolf Hess

91
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.170
Uwe Mudlos. Beate Zschäpe. and Uwe Böhnhardt.

92
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.699
attended regularly.

93
00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:40.938
So did a little Fatboy who assumed

94
00:11:40.938 --> 00:11:43.847
to play an important role. Tino Brandt.

95
00:11:45.887 --> 00:11:49.804
(speaking in foreign language)

96
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:05.420
Tino Brandt became a key player in the scene.

97
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.593
He was only 17 at the time.

98
00:12:08.789 --> 00:12:10.871
I should have been

99
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:14.788
(speaking in foreign language)

100
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.087
With the collapse of the East block.

101
00:12:33.087 --> 00:12:35.738
government authority also collapsed.

102
00:12:35.738 --> 00:12:39.373
Regeneration which has been defined by state socialism.

103
00:12:39.373 --> 00:12:42.319
was left without orientation.

104
00:12:42.319 --> 00:12:46.460
During the end forest. the village of Rudolf stat.

105
00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.082
it was here that Tino Brandt organized the neo-Nazis scene.

106
00:12:50.082 --> 00:12:53.692
1992. the town was in the headlines.

107
00:12:53.692 --> 00:12:55.722
Then a huge public demonstration.

108
00:12:55.722 --> 00:12:57.782
Hundreds of neo-Nazis marched

109
00:12:57.782 --> 00:13:01.232
through this small East German town.

110
00:13:01.232 --> 00:13:05.149
(speaking in foreign language)

111
00:13:12.585 --> 00:13:15.809
The demonstration was organized by Thomas Dienel.

112
00:13:15.809 --> 00:13:19.361
Tino Brandt's neo-Nazi role model. a fanatic.

113
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:23.278
(speaking in foreign language)

114
00:13:27.633 --> 00:13:30.633
(audience clapping)

115
00:13:31.583 --> 00:13:35.500
(speaking in foreign language)

116
00:13:37.285 --> 00:13:39.666
Having lied on (foreign language)

117
00:13:39.666 --> 00:13:42.443
One speech. one platform.

118
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.153
Murder.

119
00:13:44.153 --> 00:13:46.822
It wasn't until this appearance by Thomas Dienel

120
00:13:46.822 --> 00:13:49.142
that local police began to clamp down.

121
00:13:49.142 --> 00:13:53.280
trying now to get the situation under control.

122
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.197
(speaking in foreign language)

123
00:14:03.692 --> 00:14:05.044
In 1995.

124
00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:09.020
Tino Brandt founded the Thüringer Heimatschutz.

125
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.545
Right-wing brotherhoods were beginning to cooperate

126
00:14:11.545 --> 00:14:13.656
in pursuit of a common goal.

127
00:14:13.656 --> 00:14:17.573
(speaking in foreign language)

128
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.840
The members of Heimatschutz started

129
00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.038
to provoke authorities.

130
00:14:35.038 --> 00:14:38.694
testing limits. seeking to dominate the region.

131
00:14:38.694 --> 00:14:41.423
They began with a dummy bomb.

132
00:14:43.084 --> 00:14:47.001
(speaking in foreign language)

133
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.481
It didn't stop there.

134
00:15:06.481 --> 00:15:09.530
The fanatical neo-Nazis of the Heimatschutz

135
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.580
continued their provocative activities.

136
00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.437
Interrupting Memorial services for the victims of fascism.

137
00:15:15.437 --> 00:15:18.425
It was a coordinated campaign.

138
00:15:18.425 --> 00:15:22.342
(speaking in foreign language)

139
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.023
State investigators founded task Force Rex.

140
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:48.361
It soon identified Uwe Böhnhardt

141
00:15:48.361 --> 00:15:51.113
as a key figure in Heimatschutz.

142
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.411
They searched his parents' house on a regular basis.

143
00:15:55.411 --> 00:15:59.411
(speaking in foreign language)

144
00:16:19.922 --> 00:16:21.731
In the city of Jena. 1996.

145
00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.453
a terrorist cell was launched.

146
00:16:24.453 --> 00:16:26.760
When the president of the Central Council

147
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.060
of Jews Ignatz Bubis visited a concentration camp nearby.

148
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.016
a dummy with a star of David was found hanging in effigy.

149
00:16:35.016 --> 00:16:39.016
(speaking in foreign language)

150
00:16:55.455 --> 00:16:57.705
Uwe Böhnhardt. Uwe Mundlos.

151
00:16:59.724 --> 00:17:01.451
in their Heimatschutz comrades.

152
00:17:01.451 --> 00:17:04.160
match through the concentration camp

153
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.011
in Brown trousers and shirts.

154
00:17:06.011 --> 00:17:10.050
uniforms like Hitler stormtroopers.

155
00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.333
As if the camp had never been liberated.

156
00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:18.050
As if the victims of the Holocaust had never existed.

157
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.050
(speaking in foreign language)

158
00:17:31.159 --> 00:17:34.450
The Jena brotherhood had a strong presence in the region.

159
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.248
They made noisy appearances at the trial

160
00:17:37.248 --> 00:17:40.440
of right-wing extremist Manfred Roeder.

161
00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.913
who had desecrated the antiwar exhibit in Erfurt.

162
00:17:46.077 --> 00:17:49.573
There were plenty of role models for the young neo-Nazis.

163
00:17:52.278 --> 00:17:53.510
In this period.

164
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:57.437
the Rex task force expanded its investigations.

165
00:17:57.437 --> 00:18:00.393
observing and analyzing the Heimatschutz.

166
00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.223
They were noticed.

167
00:18:06.442 --> 00:18:10.192
(speaking foreign language)

168
00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:41.744
Investigators were also well-informed.

169
00:18:41.744 --> 00:18:46.040
They had identified a major weakness in the neo-Nazis scene.

170
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.363
It was easy to recruit informers.

171
00:18:50.856 --> 00:18:54.773
(speaking in foreign language)

172
00:19:03.043 --> 00:19:07.271
Authorities were well aware that this was not a playground.

173
00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:10.801
These were dedicated underground fighters.

174
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:14.718
(speaking in foreign language)

175
00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:32.900
At the time.

176
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.538
police didn't know that Heimatschutz members

177
00:19:34.538 --> 00:19:37.265
were already training for armed struggle

178
00:19:37.265 --> 00:19:40.262
on former Soviet military basis.

179
00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:43.012
(dramatic music)

180
00:19:46.209 --> 00:19:49.652
In October. 1996. Uwe Böhnhardt was sentenced

181
00:19:49.652 --> 00:19:54.029
to three years in prison for illegal firearms.

182
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:56.573
Police work was paying off.

183
00:19:57.638 --> 00:19:59.243
or so it seemed.

184
00:20:02.233 --> 00:20:05.125
But Böhnhardt remained a free man.

185
00:20:05.125 --> 00:20:07.267
And he took his revenge together

186
00:20:07.267 --> 00:20:09.258
with Mundlos and other friends.

187
00:20:09.258 --> 00:20:13.129
He sent dummy letter bombs to police.

188
00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:16.333
the city administration and the newspaper.

189
00:20:21.378 --> 00:20:25.295
(speaking in foreign language)

190
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:37.022
The task force pursued Heimatschutz stubbornly

191
00:20:37.022 --> 00:20:40.163
but it seemed they were making little progress.

192
00:20:41.011 --> 00:20:44.928
(speaking in foreign language)

193
00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.622
The police had a shadow adversary.

194
00:20:54.622 --> 00:20:58.539
(speaking in foreign language)

195
00:21:17.692 --> 00:21:21.478
After the downfall of socials. Germany and the secret police

196
00:21:21.478 --> 00:21:24.537
Domestic Intelligence from the West took the lead.

197
00:21:24.537 --> 00:21:28.870
(crowd singing in foreign language)

198
00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:41.462
(speaking in foreign language)

199
00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:04.210
Tino Brandts became an informer for Domestic Intelligence.

200
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:05.563
codename Otto.

201
00:22:05.563 --> 00:22:06.944
The head of Heimatschutz

202
00:22:06.944 --> 00:22:09.833
was now receiving a government paycheck.

203
00:22:11.012 --> 00:22:14.929
(speaking in foreign language)

204
00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.974
Brandt also received secret tips from Domestic Intelligence.

205
00:22:41.974 --> 00:22:44.936
about ongoing police investigations.

206
00:22:44.936 --> 00:22:47.528
They wanted to protect him as a source.

207
00:22:47.528 --> 00:22:51.445
(speaking in foreign language)

208
00:23:34.078 --> 00:23:35.717
In early 1997.

209
00:23:35.717 --> 00:23:39.220
a lethal threat emanating from right-wing extremists.

210
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.364
again became visible.

211
00:23:40.364 --> 00:23:44.030
One of them. a German neo-Nazi named Kai D snow.

212
00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:45.680
fatally shot a policeman.

213
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.251
and seriously injured another.

214
00:23:47.251 --> 00:23:51.120
He claimed he was a soldier of the white area in resistance.

215
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.678
among the fanatics.

216
00:23:52.678 --> 00:23:54.118
This made him an idol.

217
00:23:54.118 --> 00:23:58.035
(speaking in foreign language)

218
00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:07.800
The taskforce wrecks at local police noticed

219
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.576
that Heimatschutz was making concrete plans

220
00:24:10.576 --> 00:24:13.193
to take their resistance underground.

221
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:18.873
How searches had uncovered detailed sabotage manuals.

222
00:24:22.475 --> 00:24:26.392
(speaking in foreign language)

223
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.669
Uwe Böhnhardt put his knowledge into practice.

224
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:52.441
tinkering with bombs in the bedroom of his parents' flat.

225
00:24:52.441 --> 00:24:54.240
but it didn't stop there.

226
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.553
Böhnhardt. Mundlos and others

227
00:24:55.553 --> 00:24:57.569
continued their paramilitary training

228
00:24:57.569 --> 00:24:59.939
on abandoned military sites.

229
00:24:59.939 --> 00:25:02.659
They practiced with firearms and explosives.

230
00:25:02.659 --> 00:25:06.576
(speaking in foreign language)

231
00:26:06.633 --> 00:26:08.666
The Domestic Intelligence Agency

232
00:26:08.666 --> 00:26:11.971
was also following developments closely.

233
00:26:11.971 --> 00:26:16.670
They launched an operation called (indistinct)

234
00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.679
its goal to recruit more informers.

235
00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:23.533
The motto. apparently the more. the merrier.

236
00:26:24.609 --> 00:26:28.526
(speaking in foreign language)

237
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:55.450
As part of this operation. the young Heimatschutz members.

238
00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:58.361
Mundlos. Böhnhardt and Zschäpe were also considered

239
00:26:58.361 --> 00:27:01.250
for recruitment. but neither of the two men.

240
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:04.001
nor Beate Zschäpe were recruited.

241
00:27:04.001 --> 00:27:07.362
The German authorities in charge confirm this.

242
00:27:07.362 --> 00:27:11.103
At the time. Jena was brimming with intelligence agents

243
00:27:11.103 --> 00:27:13.079
and undercover police officers.

244
00:27:13.079 --> 00:27:16.472
The one gathering sources within the organization.

245
00:27:16.472 --> 00:27:20.093
the other gathering evidence for a criminal trial.

246
00:27:20.093 --> 00:27:23.708
In autumn 1997. the police had the initiative.

247
00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:26.183
during a search of Heimatschutz offices.

248
00:27:26.183 --> 00:27:28.550
they discovered alarming evidence

249
00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:31.178
that the neo-Nazis were arming themselves.

250
00:27:31.178 --> 00:27:35.095
(speaking in foreign language)

251
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.931
Not in the beginning.

252
00:27:51.931 --> 00:27:54.850
the thoughts rang true to some.

253
00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:58.767
(speaking in foreign language)

254
00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.584
The local police commissioner issued a public warning

255
00:28:07.584 --> 00:28:09.830
about a right-wing terrorist group.

256
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:13.830
(speaking in foreign language)

257
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:28.490
Political correctness however does not stop terrorism.

258
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.620
Uwe Böhnhardt and his accomplices placed a suitcase bomb

259
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.726
in front of the theater in Jena.

260
00:28:33.726 --> 00:28:36.556
It contained a few grams of TNT.

261
00:28:36.556 --> 00:28:40.473
(speaking in foreign language)

262
00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:49.882
Shortly afterwards. Böhnhardt was sentenced

263
00:28:49.882 --> 00:28:52.393
to two years by the appeals court.

264
00:28:52.393 --> 00:28:55.650
His undoing was a telephone call with Beate Zschäpe

265
00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:58.305
about the sale of neo-Nazi rock CDs.

266
00:28:58.305 --> 00:28:59.993
That was illegal.

267
00:29:01.271 --> 00:29:04.683
But again. Böhnhardt did not land in jail.

268
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:08.663
The police were still shadowing him.

269
00:29:10.075 --> 00:29:12.265
They wanted to know where the bombs

270
00:29:12.265 --> 00:29:14.673
and the dummies were built.

271
00:29:16.989 --> 00:29:20.989
(speaking in foreign language)

272
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:46.868
Domestic Intelligence was successful immediately.

273
00:29:46.868 --> 00:29:48.772
And the very first day.

274
00:29:48.772 --> 00:29:53.280
Mundlos and Böhnhardt led their tails to a secret hideaway.

275
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.280
(speaking in foreign language)

276
00:30:18.792 --> 00:30:21.351
Although Domestic Intelligence already stumbled

277
00:30:21.351 --> 00:30:23.569
upon the secret bomb factory.

278
00:30:23.569 --> 00:30:26.451
They kept their knowledge to themselves.

279
00:30:26.451 --> 00:30:29.140
for nearly two months.

280
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.944
The garage allegedly was neither searched

281
00:30:31.944 --> 00:30:35.943
nor observed and Böhnhardt remained free.

282
00:30:36.837 --> 00:30:40.754
(speaking in foreign language)

283
00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.200
In January. 1998. Böhnhardt demonstrated

284
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.080
against the antiwar exhibit.in Dresden.

285
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.543
along with Uwe Mundlos and Beate Zschäpe.

286
00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.153
She was holding a banner. nationalism.

287
00:31:14.153 --> 00:31:16.881
an idea six activists.

288
00:31:16.881 --> 00:31:18.872
One day after the demonstration

289
00:31:18.872 --> 00:31:21.827
police finally searched the secret garage.

290
00:31:21.827 --> 00:31:23.728
and Böhnhardt's apartment.

291
00:31:23.728 --> 00:31:27.645
(speaking in foreign language)

292
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:44.033
After some delays.

293
00:31:44.033 --> 00:31:46.398
when the police finally entered the garage.

294
00:31:46.398 --> 00:31:49.750
they found a bag full of tea and tea

295
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.899
as well as a number of pipe bombs.

296
00:31:51.899 --> 00:31:54.520
Some of them under construction.

297
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.383
Böhnhardt waited at his home. surrounded by police.

298
00:31:59.559 --> 00:32:03.476
(speaking in foreign language)

299
00:32:11.108 --> 00:32:13.203
Uwe Mundlos and Beate Zschäpe connected with Böhnhardt.

300
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.984
Together. the trio fled the town.

301
00:32:17.984 --> 00:32:21.984
(speaking in foreign languaage)

302
00:32:39.507 --> 00:32:42.002
In the coming months. over a dozen comrades

303
00:32:42.002 --> 00:32:47.002
from Heimatschutz. helped the fugitives with money. cars

304
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.430
and communications.

305
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:53.347
(speaking in foreign language)

306
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.470
(tense music)

307
00:32:59.429 --> 00:33:03.346
(speaking in foreign language)

308
00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.638
The trio drove East.

309
00:33:23.638 --> 00:33:26.635
and sought shelter in the city of Chemnitz.

310
00:33:26.635 --> 00:33:29.121
Here they had many supporters.

311
00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:31.925
but support for the fugitives was difficult.

312
00:33:31.925 --> 00:33:35.163
Police were targeting the trio in a public manhunt.

313
00:33:36.406 --> 00:33:40.406
(speaking in foreign language)

314
00:33:42.752 --> 00:33:45.020
Two weeks after their disappearance.

315
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.300
taskforce Rex presented his findings

316
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.864
from the garage on local television.

317
00:33:49.864 --> 00:33:53.781
(speaking in foreign language)

318
00:34:08.815 --> 00:34:12.415
Local Domestic Intelligence was also searching intensively

319
00:34:12.415 --> 00:34:13.855
for the trio.

320
00:34:13.855 --> 00:34:15.716
And soon tracked them down.

321
00:34:15.716 --> 00:34:18.738
But taskforce dubbed operation triplet.

322
00:34:18.738 --> 00:34:20.616
was observing local neo-Nazis.

323
00:34:20.616 --> 00:34:24.196
and soon discovered the fugitives were hiding in Chemnitz.

324
00:34:24.196 --> 00:34:27.050
The trio led to the neo-Nazi movement.

325
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.930
blood and honor.

326
00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:32.393
Its leaders were Toma stacker and Deon Vana.

327
00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.804
The two men maintained close relations

328
00:34:35.804 --> 00:34:39.134
with violent neo-Nazi groups in the USA.

329
00:34:39.134 --> 00:34:42.728
The German blood and honor group was strongly influenced

330
00:34:42.728 --> 00:34:46.023
by British and American white supremacists.

331
00:34:51.036 --> 00:34:53.571
One insider from blood and honor can be found

332
00:34:53.571 --> 00:34:55.960
in the USA today.

333
00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.823
Achim Schmid.

334
00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:00.497
He spent years with violent neo-Nazis.

335
00:35:01.352 --> 00:35:05.269
(speaking in foreign language)

336
00:35:10.381 --> 00:35:13.983
Smack in the middle of a very hardcore scene.

337
00:35:16.882 --> 00:35:20.799
(speaking in foreign language)

338
00:36:00.937 --> 00:36:03.443
In the 1990s. Schmid was a celebrated singer

339
00:36:03.443 --> 00:36:06.030
in the right-wing rock scene.

340
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.185
Fanatical racism was the foundation.

341
00:36:09.185 --> 00:36:13.102
(speaking in foreign language)

342
00:36:52.583 --> 00:36:54.188
The neo-Nazis from Jena also believed

343
00:36:54.188 --> 00:36:56.506
in the approaching race war.

344
00:36:56.506 --> 00:36:59.950
They burned crosses in the forests near their hometown.

345
00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:04.069
Uwe Böhnhardt posed with the Hitler salute.

346
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:06.276
Beate Zschäpe took pictures.

347
00:37:06.276 --> 00:37:08.219
The KU Klux Klan was already active

348
00:37:08.219 --> 00:37:11.188
in Germany in the early 1990s.

349
00:37:11.188 --> 00:37:14.500
Led by Karsten Shapinsky.

350
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.590
Shapinsky was also an informer. recruited in 1994

351
00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:22.030
by Domestic Intelligence in nearby Brandenburg.

352
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.553
His codename was Piato.

353
00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:27.020
In 1998 he made contact

354
00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.183
with Deon Vana of blood and honor.

355
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.590
Shapinski reported Vanna was supporting

356
00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:35.943
the three fugitive skinheads with benefit concerts.

357
00:37:36.956 --> 00:37:40.873
(speaking in foreign language)

358
00:38:05.235 --> 00:38:07.206
In the summer of 1998.

359
00:38:07.206 --> 00:38:10.363
young Vanna approached piato with a request.

360
00:38:11.435 --> 00:38:14.370
He was looking for weapons for the three Nazis

361
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:15.448
in the underground.

362
00:38:15.448 --> 00:38:17.786
Domestic Intelligence got word of this

363
00:38:17.786 --> 00:38:22.451
but prevented the police from taking action against Piato.

364
00:38:22.451 --> 00:38:24.685
Clearly. they were more interested

365
00:38:24.685 --> 00:38:26.465
in protecting their sources.

366
00:38:26.465 --> 00:38:29.593
than in preventing the trio from getting weapons.

367
00:38:32.941 --> 00:38:35.435
Local Domestic Intelligence was even able

368
00:38:35.435 --> 00:38:38.370
to contact Böhnhardt and the other fugitives

369
00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:40.023
through its informer Tino Brandt.

370
00:38:42.116 --> 00:38:46.085
This opportunity was used in a strange way.

371
00:38:46.085 --> 00:38:50.002
(speaking in foreign language)

372
00:39:06.621 --> 00:39:09.444
Domestic Intelligence knew from its sources.

373
00:39:09.444 --> 00:39:11.682
that the trio needed money.

374
00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:14.838
and wanted weapons for robberies.

375
00:39:14.838 --> 00:39:17.957
In 1998. there was an incident.

376
00:39:17.957 --> 00:39:21.874
(speaking in foreign language)

377
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:30.100
At closing time. two young men robbed a supermarket.

378
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.169
They were pursued by a customer.

379
00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:34.505
and they fired at him.

380
00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:38.422
(speaking in foreign language)

381
00:39:44.303 --> 00:39:48.833
Fortunately the man was not seriously injured or killed.

382
00:39:48.833 --> 00:39:50.977
but it was pure luck.

383
00:39:50.977 --> 00:39:52.307
Shortly after the incident.

384
00:39:52.307 --> 00:39:54.211
a large sum of money was transferred

385
00:39:54.211 --> 00:39:57.070
to the girlfriend of Yon Vanna.

386
00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:00.433
who was an important supporter of the neo-Nazi fugitives.

387
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.801
We tried to interview Vanna about the robbery

388
00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:05.650
and the hunt for weapons.

389
00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:08.369
He wouldn't talk about this or about his context

390
00:40:08.369 --> 00:40:10.521
to militant neo-Nazis in England.

391
00:40:10.521 --> 00:40:13.363
Members of the white area in resistance.

392
00:40:16.124 --> 00:40:20.041
(speaking in foreign language)

393
00:40:33.708 --> 00:40:36.210
Two months after Copeland's bombings.

394
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:39.903
Uwe Böhnhardt and Uwe Mundlos got down to business.

395
00:40:39.903 --> 00:40:42.720
In Nuremberg. near the railway station.

396
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.572
they planted a bomb.

397
00:40:44.572 --> 00:40:47.373
in a small pub run by a Turk.

398
00:40:48.699 --> 00:40:51.366
It was designed to look like a flashlight.

399
00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:54.633
when switched on. it would explode.

400
00:40:56.601 --> 00:40:58.749
A young Turk found the device.

401
00:40:58.749 --> 00:41:01.033
but his injuries were minor.

402
00:41:05.907 --> 00:41:09.663
During this time. the neo-Nazis underground group managed

403
00:41:09.663 --> 00:41:13.970
to obtain a Ceska 83 pistol with a silencer.

404
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:16.121
765 millimeter.

405
00:41:16.121 --> 00:41:18.871
(dramatic music)

406
00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:25.140
Internationally. the white area in resistance.

407
00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.963
was growing more radical.

408
00:41:29.127 --> 00:41:33.044
(speaking in foreign language)

409
00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.510
(dramatic music)

410
00:41:56.991 --> 00:41:59.333
Racism knew no bounds.

411
00:42:00.448 --> 00:42:04.365
(speaking in foreign language)

412
00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:29.775
This text became the Bible for the militant neo-Nazi scene.

413
00:42:29.816 --> 00:42:33.733
(speaking in foreign language)

414
00:43:06.139 --> 00:43:10.117
By 2000. militant neo-Nazi groups around the world

415
00:43:10.117 --> 00:43:12.670
were contemplating attacks.

416
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:15.737
At this time Böhnhardt and Mundlos must've started to scout

417
00:43:15.737 --> 00:43:18.990
for victims and targets.

418
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.103
In this phase.

419
00:43:20.103 --> 00:43:22.971
the Federal Domestic Intelligence Agency was warning

420
00:43:22.971 --> 00:43:25.581
that right-wing terrorists would not strike

421
00:43:25.581 --> 00:43:27.833
in large organized groups.

422
00:43:27.833 --> 00:43:30.539
but rather as underground cells.

423
00:43:30.539 --> 00:43:34.456
(speaking in foreign language)

424
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.588
In fact. the Domestic Intelligence Agency

425
00:43:52.588 --> 00:43:54.348
and several of its local branches

426
00:43:54.348 --> 00:43:57.040
almost caught the fugitive trio.

427
00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.152
For example. Thomas Targa. an important supporter

428
00:44:00.152 --> 00:44:03.843
of the trio was being very closely monitored.

429
00:44:03.843 --> 00:44:07.340
The agents also stumbled on an apartment in Chemnitz.

430
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.422
in which they suspected a supporter of the trio.

431
00:44:10.422 --> 00:44:13.110
Once again. the police turned to the public

432
00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:16.059
in order to lure the fugitives out in the open.

433
00:44:16.059 --> 00:44:20.059
(speaking in foreign language)

434
00:44:33.376 --> 00:44:35.241
On the day the program was broadcast.

435
00:44:35.241 --> 00:44:38.984
the apartment of the trio supporter was being monitored

436
00:44:38.984 --> 00:44:40.847
by Domestic Intelligence.

437
00:44:40.847 --> 00:44:43.274
A man was filmed but not investigated.

438
00:44:43.274 --> 00:44:46.433
Several weeks passed before the footage was reviewed

439
00:44:46.433 --> 00:44:47.811
by federal police.

440
00:44:47.811 --> 00:44:50.839
Investigators were 90% certain.

441
00:44:50.839 --> 00:44:55.402
the unidentified man was the fugitive Uwe Böhnhardt.

442
00:44:55.402 --> 00:44:59.524
Shortly after the broadcast. Böhnhardt. Mundlos and Zschäpe.

443
00:44:59.524 --> 00:45:01.163
disappeared again.

444
00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:04.223
but they were nearby.

445
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.720
With the help of their supporters.

446
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.281
they relocated on the outskirts of Zwickau.

447
00:45:09.281 --> 00:45:13.773
right-wing terror was a hot topic in Germany at the time.

448
00:45:13.773 --> 00:45:17.690
(speaking in foreign language)

449
00:45:25.176 --> 00:45:29.120
Importantly. Obama tech in Dusseldorf was a wake up call

450
00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.710
for the political establishment.

451
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:35.093
The victims were mostly Jewish immigrants from Russia.

452
00:45:36.006 --> 00:45:39.923
(speaking in foreign language)

453
00:45:50.308 --> 00:45:53.028
Politicians were under pressure.

454
00:45:53.028 --> 00:45:56.223
Right-wing attacks were in the headlines.

455
00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:02.210
As a result. the federal government banned blood and honor.

456
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:05.903
the right wing network supporting the fanatical fugitives.

457
00:46:07.237 --> 00:46:10.828
Shortly before. Carson Chapinski the informer so close

458
00:46:10.828 --> 00:46:15.273
to the trio. was unmasked as informer Piato.

459
00:46:15.273 --> 00:46:19.470
Now the trio knew police and Domestic Intelligence

460
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:20.333
were onto them.

461
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:28.090
Shortly after piato's cover was blown.

462
00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:30.050
The underground terrorists began

463
00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:33.320
their unprecedented series of murders.

464
00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.651
In September 2000. Böhnhardt and Mundlos

465
00:46:35.651 --> 00:46:39.867
found their first target on the outskirts of Nuremberg.

466
00:46:39.867 --> 00:46:43.065
close to the historic Nazi party rally grounds.

467
00:46:43.065 --> 00:46:45.943
They approached a man selling flowers.

468
00:46:47.027 --> 00:46:50.894
They fired with two guns at the man in his van.

469
00:46:50.894 --> 00:46:54.544
Hit by eight bullets. he survived for two days.

470
00:46:54.544 --> 00:46:57.705
He was the first of 10 innocent victims

471
00:46:57.705 --> 00:47:00.680
of their unprecedented killing spree.

472
00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.974
No one in law enforcement made the connection

473
00:47:02.974 --> 00:47:06.930
between this heinous crime and the neo-Nazis trio

474
00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.610
in the underground.

475
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:12.189
After the first murder. Zschäpe. Mundlos and Böhnhardt.

476
00:47:12.189 --> 00:47:14.977
continued to live on the outskirts of Zwickau

477
00:47:14.977 --> 00:47:17.140
in a small flat.

478
00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:21.316
Here they created their first video claiming responsibility.

479
00:47:21.316 --> 00:47:23.733
(rock music)

480
00:47:35.577 --> 00:47:36.680
At that time.

481
00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.660
another important informer for Domestic Intelligence

482
00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:41.710
was also living in Zwickau.

483
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:46.710
His name was Ralf Marschner. codename Primus.

484
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:50.070
He'd been secretly observing the militant right-wing scene

485
00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:51.804
for years.

486
00:47:51.804 --> 00:47:55.356
At one time. he sold blood and honor propaganda videos

487
00:47:55.356 --> 00:47:56.842
in Thüringer.

488
00:47:56.842 --> 00:47:59.592
(dramatic music)

489
00:48:04.978 --> 00:48:08.043
In 2000. he ran a small construction firm

490
00:48:08.043 --> 00:48:09.855
for demolition work.

491
00:48:09.855 --> 00:48:13.313
Previously he'd never held a job for very long.

492
00:48:15.286 --> 00:48:19.203
(speaking in foreign language)

493
00:48:37.176 --> 00:48:40.803
Marschner was able to employ his right-wing friends.

494
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:47.026
(speaking in foreign language)

495
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:22.268
Clearly. Uwe Mundlos was working for the informer.

496
00:49:22.268 --> 00:49:26.185
(speaking in foreign language)

497
00:49:38.596 --> 00:49:42.017
Today. the former Domestic Intelligence informer

498
00:49:42.017 --> 00:49:45.264
runs a shop in Lichtenstein.

499
00:49:45.264 --> 00:49:49.181
(speaking in foreign language)

500
00:50:04.638 --> 00:50:07.171
In his statements to Swiss police.

501
00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:10.630
Marschner merely stated that a certain Max-Florian Burkhardt

502
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.300
had worked for him.

503
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:15.250
Burkhardt was the most important alias used by Uwe Mundlos

504
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:17.196
in the underground.

505
00:50:17.196 --> 00:50:20.023
He had identity papers in that name.

506
00:50:22.577 --> 00:50:25.140
Had one of the fugitives therefore worked

507
00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.917
for a government informer?

508
00:50:27.917 --> 00:50:30.667
(dramatic music)

509
00:50:33.913 --> 00:50:37.830
(speaking in foreign language)

510
00:51:03.572 --> 00:51:07.483
No wonder the informer doesn't want to talk about it.

511
00:51:10.312 --> 00:51:13.096
While Mundlos was supposedly working for him.

512
00:51:13.096 --> 00:51:17.230
two cars were rented in the name of Martinez company.

513
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:20.048
One. on June 13th. 2001.

514
00:51:20.048 --> 00:51:22.452
The day the second NSU victim was shot

515
00:51:22.452 --> 00:51:24.483
and killed in Nuremberg.

516
00:51:24.483 --> 00:51:29.343
The victim was Abdurrahim Özüdoğru. the tailor.

517
00:51:32.431 --> 00:51:36.720
The cars were used for transportation to construction sites.

518
00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.370
Marschner claims.

519
00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:40.058
He offers no explanation how he was able

520
00:51:40.058 --> 00:51:42.591
to afford such expensive vehicles.

521
00:51:42.591 --> 00:51:46.083
even though his company was constantly short of cash.

522
00:51:47.034 --> 00:51:49.429
The informer maintains his silence.

523
00:51:49.429 --> 00:51:52.140
His intelligence officer also claims

524
00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.413
Marschner knew nothing.

525
00:51:55.168 --> 00:51:58.550
A close friend and employee of Marschner was registered

526
00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:02.360
as driver of the vehicle. Yens G from Civico.

527
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:06.333
He lives in that Poland Straza. across from the corner house

528
00:52:06.333 --> 00:52:10.127
where the terrorists lived for seven years.

529
00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:12.493
They moved here in May. 2001.

530
00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:17.143
and continued their murderous activities from this location.

531
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:26.411
Marschner again. rented a car

532
00:52:26.411 --> 00:52:30.918
from August 15th to September 1st. 2001.

533
00:52:30.918 --> 00:52:34.050
During this time span. on August 29th.

534
00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:38.513
Habil Kılıç was shot and killed in Munchen.

535
00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:42.053
The murder weapon was a ceska 83.

536
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:48.581
In 2002. the Domestic Intelligence Agency deactivated

537
00:52:48.581 --> 00:52:50.177
several informers.

538
00:52:50.177 --> 00:52:53.418
They'd been discovered to be perpetual liars.

539
00:52:53.418 --> 00:52:58.059
Marschner alias Primus was also decommissioned at this time.

540
00:52:58.059 --> 00:53:00.559
(tense music)

541
00:53:03.216 --> 00:53:06.255
The first traces of the underground terror group

542
00:53:06.255 --> 00:53:09.950
are today's stored in Berlin. quite spec.

543
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:12.535
By 2002 the group had given itself a name.

544
00:53:12.535 --> 00:53:15.661
and was contacting the right-wing scene.

545
00:53:15.661 --> 00:53:20.661
Under the designation National Socialist Underground or NSU.

546
00:53:20.666 --> 00:53:24.419
the terrorists contributed money to neo-Nazi magazines.

547
00:53:24.419 --> 00:53:27.327
Their donations were accompanied by a slogan

548
00:53:27.327 --> 00:53:32.327
with a very clear message. victory or death.

549
00:53:32.826 --> 00:53:36.410
Some of the magazines are filed with the anti-fascist

550
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:37.770
archive in Berlin.

551
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:40.683
They are available to the general public today.

552
00:53:40.683 --> 00:53:42.461
and they were then.

553
00:53:42.461 --> 00:53:46.707
when the neo-Nazi paper publicly thanked the NSU.

554
00:53:46.707 --> 00:53:50.166
The Domestic Intelligence Agency was aware of this.

555
00:53:50.166 --> 00:53:52.568
but apparently no one made the connection

556
00:53:52.568 --> 00:53:56.198
to the fugitive terror trio behind it.

557
00:53:56.198 --> 00:53:59.330
And thus. the series continued.

558
00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:03.247
(speaking in foreign language)

559
00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:33.845
For no apparent reason.

560
00:54:33.845 --> 00:54:37.111
the NSU took a break of three years.

561
00:54:37.111 --> 00:54:38.838
No one was killed.

562
00:54:38.838 --> 00:54:43.838
The Cesca was unused. until February. 2004.

563
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:47.291
when the group struck again. this time in Rostock.

564
00:54:47.291 --> 00:54:49.824
The victim. the 24 year old immigrant

565
00:54:49.824 --> 00:54:52.312
from Turkey. Mehmet Turgut

566
00:54:52.312 --> 00:54:57.312
the police investigation took off on the wrong track.

567
00:54:57.998 --> 00:55:01.915
(speaking in foreign language)

568
00:55:34.009 --> 00:55:36.460
Mundlos and Böhnhardt used other weapons

569
00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:37.680
for their robberies.

570
00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.450
Never the ceska.

571
00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:43.840
Still in 2004. Böhnhardt and Mundlos committed their crimes

572
00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.662
in broad daylight.

573
00:55:45.662 --> 00:55:49.112
On TV. the police were searching for bank robbers linked

574
00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:51.662
to Zwickau who escaped on bicycles.

575
00:55:51.662 --> 00:55:55.227
The method was always the same yet neither the police.

576
00:55:55.227 --> 00:55:58.940
nor the intelligence service connected the dots.

577
00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:02.603
Although the trio was still perceived as a threat.

578
00:56:03.637 --> 00:56:07.554
(speaking in foreign language)

579
00:56:13.434 --> 00:56:16.500
Only a few weeks after their attacks were reported again

580
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.998
on television.

581
00:56:17.998 --> 00:56:22.233
Uwe Mundlos and Uwe Böhnhardt surfaced in cologne.

582
00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:28.294
On a June afternoon in 2004. Böhnhardt approached the heart

583
00:56:28.294 --> 00:56:31.390
of Cologne's Turkish community on a bicycle.

584
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:33.682
Uwe Mundlos followed close behind.

585
00:56:33.682 --> 00:56:37.536
and parked his bicycle right in front of a hairdresser's.

586
00:56:37.536 --> 00:56:40.173
In the bike basket was a gas bottle filled.

587
00:56:40.173 --> 00:56:42.698
with black powder and nails.

588
00:56:42.698 --> 00:56:47.131
It was connected to a remote controlled detonator.

589
00:56:47.131 --> 00:56:51.048
(speaking in foreign language)

590
00:57:20.622 --> 00:57:23.950
The nails. shot like SRAP nails with the neighborhood

591
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:26.163
injuring dozens of people.

592
00:57:26.163 --> 00:57:29.683
The Cologne police did not suspect a right-wing attack.

593
00:57:29.683 --> 00:57:33.434
Although its aim was to randomly target immigrants.

594
00:57:33.434 --> 00:57:37.351
(speaking in foreign language)

595
00:57:51.830 --> 00:57:54.906
But again. the Domestic Intelligence Agency

596
00:57:54.906 --> 00:57:56.209
had the right hunch.

597
00:57:56.209 --> 00:57:59.802
They saw the parallels to nail bombs in London.

598
00:57:59.802 --> 00:58:02.417
instructions on how to build such bombs

599
00:58:02.417 --> 00:58:07.063
that appeared in detail in British neo-Nazi magazines.

600
00:58:07.063 --> 00:58:09.463
Yon Vanna. the NSU supporter.

601
00:58:09.463 --> 00:58:12.493
had a close relationship to their publishers.

602
00:58:13.747 --> 00:58:17.309
In Vayner surroundings was an additional informer.

603
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:19.911
Thomas starker. an important supporter

604
00:58:19.911 --> 00:58:21.553
of the underground terror trio.

605
00:58:21.553 --> 00:58:25.563
had hired on as a source for the Berlin police.

606
00:58:27.157 --> 00:58:31.606
Nevertheless. no one moved to stop the trio.

607
00:58:31.606 --> 00:58:33.693
After the attack in cologne.

608
00:58:33.693 --> 00:58:38.200
the three from Jena took a vacation on the Baltic sea.

609
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.353
No matter how close the investigation got

610
00:58:40.353 --> 00:58:42.294
to the underground Nazis.

611
00:58:42.294 --> 00:58:45.508
no one seemed to be able to stop them

612
00:58:45.508 --> 00:58:48.193
on their national killing spree.

613
00:58:49.391 --> 00:58:54.391
Summer. 2005. a year to the day after the nail bomb attack.

614
00:58:56.282 --> 00:58:58.062
Once again. it was 9th of June.

615
00:58:58.062 --> 00:59:03.062
As in Cologne. the NSU located sixth murder attack.

616
00:59:03.706 --> 00:59:07.470
Ismail Yasar was working in his Kebab stand

617
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:09.877
in a supermarket parking lot.

618
00:59:09.877 --> 00:59:13.012
Police investigators still suspected the perpetrators came

619
00:59:13.012 --> 00:59:16.730
from the field of organized crime.

620
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:20.200
A special task force. the BAO Bosporus.

621
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.550
now took over the case.

622
00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:25.467
(speaking in foreign language)

623
00:59:46.206 --> 00:59:49.942
This time. several witnesses saw the murderers.

624
00:59:49.942 --> 00:59:54.175
They came on bicycles. and there were two of them.

625
00:59:54.175 --> 00:59:57.786
All the leads were reviewed by the investigators.

626
00:59:57.786 --> 01:00:01.065
They also called in a profiler.

627
01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:05.065
(speaking in foreign language)

628
01:00:36.736 --> 01:00:39.744
Only a few days later. on June 15th.

629
01:00:39.744 --> 01:00:41.963
the weapon was used again.

630
01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:46.060
Theodoros Boulgarides. a Greek shopkeeper.

631
01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:50.467
was shot and murdered in his key service store in Munchen.

632
01:00:50.467 --> 01:00:53.370
And whether coincidence or not.

633
01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:55.632
on the same day. after long discussions.

634
01:00:55.632 --> 01:00:59.040
Domestic Intelligence reactivated there informer

635
01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.234
Corelli. Thomas Richter.

636
01:01:02.234 --> 01:01:05.450
The president of the Domestic Intelligence Agency

637
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:09.360
Hans Maaben. personally reactivated Corelli as an informer.

638
01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:13.593
He had been deactivated due to unreliability.

639
01:01:13.593 --> 01:01:18.593
Now. his contacts in the right-wing scene were needed again.

640
01:01:18.901 --> 01:01:21.230
Thomas Richter was well networked.

641
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:24.173
with context extending into the KU Klux Klan.

642
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:29.466
(speaking in foreign language)

643
01:01:36.704 --> 01:01:39.954
But occultists were welcome in the KKK.

644
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:44.787
(speaking in foreign language)

645
01:01:55.655 --> 01:01:57.911
Schimid introduced the intelligence informer

646
01:01:57.911 --> 01:02:01.892
into his local branch of the KU Klux Klan.

647
01:02:01.892 --> 01:02:05.809
(speaking in foreign language)

648
01:02:09.439 --> 01:02:12.570
Thomas Richter reported to Domestic Intelligence

649
01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:15.430
on how often Schimid's clan chapter

650
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:17.523
was getting continually larger.

651
01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:22.486
(speaking in foreign language)

652
01:02:35.474 --> 01:02:38.898
Corelli reported in detail about the clan.

653
01:02:38.898 --> 01:02:42.777
but he also withheld other information from the authorities.

654
01:02:42.777 --> 01:02:46.694
(speaking in foreign language)

655
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:58.587
According to the official version.

656
01:02:58.587 --> 01:03:02.661
which the past music CD onto Domestic Intelligence.

657
01:03:02.661 --> 01:03:04.691
on its cover were Hitler's hands.

658
01:03:04.691 --> 01:03:08.989
and NSDAP. for Hitler's third Reich party.

659
01:03:08.989 --> 01:03:12.906
(speaking in foreign language)

660
01:03:35.706 --> 01:03:39.100
After years of feudal searching for the murderers

661
01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.065
with a cesca.

662
01:03:40.065 --> 01:03:43.566
police turned to the intelligence services for help.

663
01:03:43.566 --> 01:03:46.819
In March. 2006. they contacted Domestic Intelligence

664
01:03:46.819 --> 01:03:50.007
in Hessen. and they forwarded an information sheet

665
01:03:50.007 --> 01:03:52.035
about the serial killings.

666
01:03:52.035 --> 01:03:54.567
They wanted informers to ask around

667
01:03:54.567 --> 01:03:57.710
to find what people in the scene were saying.

668
01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:00.660
The murder weapon. the cesca.

669
01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.889
was the only link between the victims.

670
01:04:02.889 --> 01:04:06.834
Barely two weeks later that same weapon was used again.

671
01:04:06.834 --> 01:04:11.560
On April 4th. 2006. Mehmet Kubasik was shot

672
01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.100
in his wife's kiosk in Dortmund's notch debt.

673
01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.830
He was helping out.

674
01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:19.973
It was pure coincidence that Kubasik was in the shop.

675
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.503
Shortly before the crime. two thin men on bicycles

676
01:04:24.503 --> 01:04:26.773
were seen in the vicinity.

677
01:04:26.773 --> 01:04:29.523
(dramatic music)

678
01:04:33.012 --> 01:04:35.162
Two days after the Dortmund murder.

679
01:04:35.162 --> 01:04:38.978
Halit Yozgat the young owner of an internet cafe.

680
01:04:38.978 --> 01:04:41.720
was shot and killed in his shop.

681
01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.720
For the ninth time. the murder weapon was the cesca 83.

682
01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:50.139
The murderer fired two bullets into the victim's head

683
01:04:50.139 --> 01:04:54.056
(speaking in foreign language)

684
01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:31.428
Six people had been in the cafe when the owner was shot.

685
01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:35.376
They all made statements. except one.

686
01:05:35.376 --> 01:05:37.357
A person of interest.

687
01:05:37.357 --> 01:05:40.903
A 14 year old boy had seen the man and could describe him.

688
01:05:40.903 --> 01:05:43.911
The police analyzed the computer he'd been using

689
01:05:43.911 --> 01:05:46.021
and found a suspect.

690
01:05:46.021 --> 01:05:47.908
He had several apartments.

691
01:05:47.908 --> 01:05:50.546
including one in his parents' house

692
01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:52.513
on the outskirts of castle.

693
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:56.697
Searching it. the police found several weapons.

694
01:05:56.697 --> 01:06:00.611
and confidential intelligence documents.

695
01:06:00.611 --> 01:06:04.924
His name was. Andreas Temme.

696
01:06:04.924 --> 01:06:09.300
He handled informers for the local Domestic Intelligence

697
01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.556
in Hessen.

698
01:06:10.556 --> 01:06:14.473
(speaking in foreign language)

699
01:06:31.255 --> 01:06:35.610
Police detectives reenacted the situation at the crime scene

700
01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:37.403
with intelligence agent Temme.

701
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:40.310
He claimed he'd been surfing in the back room.

702
01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:41.653
and then wanted to pay.

703
01:06:42.828 --> 01:06:46.860
First. he'd looked for the owner of the cafe at the counter.

704
01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:48.563
then outside.

705
01:06:50.527 --> 01:06:52.313
but he didn't find him.

706
01:06:53.425 --> 01:06:56.810
By then. the police are sure.

707
01:06:56.810 --> 01:07:00.933
Halit Yozgat was already lying dead on the floor.

708
01:07:00.933 --> 01:07:04.850
(speaking in foreign language)

709
01:08:02.232 --> 01:08:06.319
A lying a secret agent. and the police were helpless.

710
01:08:06.319 --> 01:08:10.236
(speaking in foreign language)

711
01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:34.448
Domestic Intelligence remains silent on the issue.

712
01:08:34.448 --> 01:08:39.448
Events in the internet cafe are still unclear today.

713
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:44.000
Temme handled the source in the right-wing scene

714
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.804
where the murderers were active.

715
01:08:45.804 --> 01:08:49.282
The hessian committee of inquiry was unable to find out

716
01:08:49.282 --> 01:08:54.070
why the informer had called Temme shortly before the crime.

717
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:56.425
As a standard procedure the police investigators

718
01:08:56.425 --> 01:08:59.080
had tapped Temme's telephone.

719
01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.161
They heard his colleagues asking

720
01:09:00.161 --> 01:09:02.697
about a situation as a suspect.

721
01:09:02.697 --> 01:09:06.614
(speaking in foreign language)

722
01:09:16.325 --> 01:09:18.875
A high ranking officer from Domestic Intelligence

723
01:09:18.875 --> 01:09:22.095
was recorded making another controversial statement

724
01:09:22.095 --> 01:09:24.899
to Temme on the phone.

725
01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:28.816
(speaking in foreign language)

726
01:09:48.958 --> 01:09:51.832
Six months after the police ended their investigation

727
01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:54.319
against the intelligence agent.

728
01:09:54.319 --> 01:09:57.908
the man who knew nothing. heard nothing and saw nothing.

729
01:09:57.908 --> 01:10:02.474
was given a new job in the government pension office.

730
01:10:02.474 --> 01:10:04.837
10 years after the murder.

731
01:10:04.837 --> 01:10:07.643
He still doesn't want to answer questions.

732
01:10:11.363 --> 01:10:14.970
Which is one of the reasons the murder of your Yozgat

733
01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:18.163
has not been fully explained to this day.

734
01:10:19.125 --> 01:10:23.125
(speaking in foreign language)

735
01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:03.864
The actual role of intelligence agent Temme remains unclear.

736
01:11:03.864 --> 01:11:07.781
(speaking in foreign language)

737
01:11:23.682 --> 01:11:26.374
Yet the murder in counsel was the turning point

738
01:11:26.374 --> 01:11:29.558
for taskforce BAO Bosporus.

739
01:11:29.558 --> 01:11:33.580
The investigators realized their organized crime theory

740
01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:34.842
had been wrong.

741
01:11:34.842 --> 01:11:38.842
(speaking in foreign language)

742
01:12:14.226 --> 01:12:18.444
The investigators were now closing in on the real killers.

743
01:12:18.444 --> 01:12:21.740
They were looking for two men who were on a mission

744
01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:23.332
to kill immigrants.

745
01:12:23.332 --> 01:12:27.249
(speaking in foreign language)

746
01:12:51.150 --> 01:12:53.842
These brothers in spirit were bound together

747
01:12:53.842 --> 01:12:57.345
by their hatred of all things foreign.

748
01:12:57.345 --> 01:13:01.262
(speaking in foreign language)

749
01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:18.468
The investigators Dragnet.

750
01:13:18.468 --> 01:13:20.749
They were looking for two perpetrators

751
01:13:20.749 --> 01:13:23.575
male. who had dropped out of the right-wing scene

752
01:13:23.575 --> 01:13:26.645
before the first murder in 2000.

753
01:13:26.645 --> 01:13:31.383
following the Motto. deeds not words.

754
01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:39.561
(speaking in foreign language)

755
01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:48.128
The investigators launched a media campaign.

756
01:13:48.128 --> 01:13:51.558
They also went on local TV in East Germany.

757
01:13:51.558 --> 01:13:53.878
They were on the doorstep of the killers.

758
01:13:53.878 --> 01:13:57.383
who were still hiding in plain sight.

759
01:13:57.383 --> 01:14:01.300
(speaking in foreign language)

760
01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:34.990
The program was apparently also watched in Zwickau.

761
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:39.766
four days after the broadcast Uwe Böhnhardt robbed a bank.

762
01:14:39.766 --> 01:14:41.135
on his own.

763
01:14:41.135 --> 01:14:44.263
He came within an inch of being overwhelmed.

764
01:14:45.675 --> 01:14:49.592
(speaking in foreign language)

765
01:15:03.025 --> 01:15:06.795
At least one underground terrorist seemed to be nervous.

766
01:15:06.795 --> 01:15:10.712
(speaking in foreign language)

767
01:15:23.092 --> 01:15:25.741
The Ceska series of murders was actually over.

768
01:15:25.741 --> 01:15:28.612
without the investigators noticing.

769
01:15:28.612 --> 01:15:31.480
Had they unsettled the murderers?

770
01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:34.283
Böhnhardt and Mundlos however didn't change

771
01:15:34.283 --> 01:15:36.232
their approach completely.

772
01:15:36.232 --> 01:15:37.914
They continued to Rob banks

773
01:15:37.914 --> 01:15:41.636
and again were filmed several times.

774
01:15:41.636 --> 01:15:45.553
(speaking in foreign language)

775
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.481
Now. there was an identikit picture

776
01:15:54.481 --> 01:15:56.873
of Uwe Böhnhardt as a bank robber.

777
01:15:56.873 --> 01:16:01.804
And once again. it seemed there was a reaction in Zwickau.

778
01:16:01.804 --> 01:16:05.417
On the day the police manhunt program was broadcast.

779
01:16:05.417 --> 01:16:07.940
it appears that Uwe Mundlos began

780
01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:12.270
to edit a new NSU confessor DVD.

781
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:15.130
For six weeks. he worked on a film.

782
01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:17.902
using material from the "Pink Panther" television series.

783
01:16:17.902 --> 01:16:22.053
The NSU confessed to the nine murders.

784
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:27.471
But then something must have happened

785
01:16:27.471 --> 01:16:30.500
that they weren't expecting.

786
01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:34.169
Böhnhardt and Mundlos rented a mobile home

787
01:16:34.169 --> 01:16:37.840
as they had performed most of their other murders.

788
01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.786
The mobile home was observed by the police

789
01:16:39.786 --> 01:16:44.020
in Oberstenfeld on the outskirts of Heilbronn.

790
01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:47.638
on April 25th. 2007.

791
01:16:47.638 --> 01:16:51.720
A few minutes earlier. police woman Michele Kiesewetter

792
01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.790
had been shot in Heilbronn.

793
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:55.963
Her colleague critically wounded.

794
01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:00.487
The perpetrators had taken the officer's service weapons.

795
01:17:00.487 --> 01:17:04.042
The crime took place in the middle of the city.

796
01:17:04.042 --> 01:17:06.248
in broad daylight.

797
01:17:06.248 --> 01:17:08.700
The victim police woman Kiesewetter

798
01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:10.768
was born in Oberweisbach.

799
01:17:10.768 --> 01:17:12.701
The small village is a few miles away

800
01:17:12.701 --> 01:17:16.663
from Moodle step where the NSU has its roots.

801
01:17:18.954 --> 01:17:22.070
Police woman Kiesewetter was buried right

802
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:25.450
in the Heartland of the Thuringer Heimatchtuz.

803
01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:28.975
Her colleagues from the riot police formed an honor guard.

804
01:17:28.975 --> 01:17:31.430
One of these colleagues Timo Hess.

805
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:34.701
was in Heilabronn on the day of the crime.

806
01:17:34.701 --> 01:17:39.701
He led her unit and was at the scene within minutes.

807
01:17:40.415 --> 01:17:43.717
He had contacts to fanatics as a young policeman.

808
01:17:43.717 --> 01:17:46.662
he had been a member of the KU Klux Klan.

809
01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:50.662
(speaking in foreign language)

810
01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:32.248
Back then. the policeman wrote an essay about politics

811
01:18:32.248 --> 01:18:36.977
and race in the spirit of a white area in resistance.

812
01:18:36.977 --> 01:18:40.049
like the ideology of the murderers of his colleague.

813
01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:44.345
who also admitted the murder of Kiesewetter on their DVD.

814
01:18:44.345 --> 01:18:47.496
(speaking in foreign language)

815
01:18:47.496 --> 01:18:50.246
(dramatic music)

816
01:18:57.930 --> 01:19:02.378
The BAO Bosporus taskforce continued to search publicly

817
01:19:02.378 --> 01:19:05.100
for the murderers with the ceska.

818
01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:05.984
and extended their inquiries

819
01:19:05.984 --> 01:19:08.484
to include the police woman's murder.

820
01:19:08.484 --> 01:19:12.484
(speaking in foreign language)

821
01:19:22.939 --> 01:19:24.976
And yet there were no visible connections

822
01:19:24.976 --> 01:19:28.211
between the series of nine murders of immigrants.

823
01:19:28.211 --> 01:19:30.040
and the Kiesewetter case.

824
01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.503
The investigators were stumped.

825
01:19:33.462 --> 01:19:37.379
(speaking in foreign language)

826
01:19:46.606 --> 01:19:49.460
A few months after the murder of Michele Kiesewetter.

827
01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:51.557
the task force ceased its investigations.

828
01:19:51.557 --> 01:19:53.847
its efforts had been in vain.

829
01:19:53.847 --> 01:19:57.764
(speaking in foreign language)

830
01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:15.810
Even the murderers seemed to have had enough.

831
01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:17.800
A year after the Kiesewetter murder.

832
01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:21.330
the trio moved to a middle-class district in Zwickau.

833
01:20:22.778 --> 01:20:25.460
They turned their apartment into a warehouse.

834
01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:29.434
for weapons. ammunition trophies of their deeds.

835
01:20:29.434 --> 01:20:31.609
The hideout was monitored by cameras.

836
01:20:31.609 --> 01:20:35.211
that recorded how they came in and out of the house.

837
01:20:35.211 --> 01:20:39.246
They received visits from friends from the right-wing scene.

838
01:20:39.246 --> 01:20:43.643
Why Zschäpe. Böhnhardt and Mundlos chose such protection

839
01:20:43.643 --> 01:20:45.043
is unknown.

840
01:20:45.043 --> 01:20:49.425
Then in September. 2011 after a break for four years.

841
01:20:49.425 --> 01:20:52.397
they prepared another bank robbery.

842
01:20:52.397 --> 01:20:55.179
They hired a camper and stowed bicycles in it

843
01:20:55.179 --> 01:20:57.140
for their escape.

844
01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:01.057
(speaking in foreign language)

845
01:21:07.426 --> 01:21:10.622
Investigators in Saxony recognized their series

846
01:21:10.622 --> 01:21:12.989
of 13 bank robberies.

847
01:21:12.989 --> 01:21:17.070
and passed on a tip to their colleagues in Thuringer.

848
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:20.787
Perpetrators must have escaped in a van or a camper.

849
01:21:20.787 --> 01:21:24.787
(speaking in foreign language)

850
01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:37.595
Chief of detectives. Michael Menzel

851
01:21:37.595 --> 01:21:40.595
expected the bank robbers would strike again soon.

852
01:21:40.595 --> 01:21:45.445
He kept police officers on standby for weeks.

853
01:21:45.445 --> 01:21:49.362
(speaking in foreign language)

854
01:22:01.503 --> 01:22:06.503
The time finally came on the 4th of November. 2011.

855
01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:08.706
The bank robbers struck again.

856
01:22:08.706 --> 01:22:11.784
They got away with more than 70.000 euros.

857
01:22:11.784 --> 01:22:14.921
but as they put their bicycles in the camper.

858
01:22:14.921 --> 01:22:16.447
they were seen.

859
01:22:16.447 --> 01:22:20.996
Now. the police knew which vehicle to look for.

860
01:22:20.996 --> 01:22:24.996
(speaking in foreign language)

861
01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:57.485
The bank robbers knew the police were on their trail.

862
01:22:57.485 --> 01:23:02.485
They drove into a new residential area. and waited.

863
01:23:02.599 --> 01:23:04.760
The squad car found them.

864
01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:06.666
The two policemen would later report

865
01:23:06.666 --> 01:23:08.890
that they had heard shots.

866
01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:11.918
Flames flared up.

867
01:23:11.918 --> 01:23:15.835
(speaking in foreign language)

868
01:23:28.179 --> 01:23:31.881
The camper was towed to a warehouse and examined.

869
01:23:31.881 --> 01:23:34.199
the corpse is still inside.

870
01:23:34.199 --> 01:23:38.116
(speaking in foreign language)

871
01:23:51.315 --> 01:23:54.372
Evidence from 10 murders was found in the camper.

872
01:23:54.372 --> 01:23:56.943
The confessor DVDs and the weapons belonging

873
01:23:56.943 --> 01:24:00.437
to the murdered police woman and her colleague.

874
01:24:03.155 --> 01:24:07.072
(speaking in foreign language)

875
01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:20.363
The police in GOTA contacted the state police in Thüringer.

876
01:24:20.363 --> 01:24:22.813
that had been hunting Zschäpe. Mundlos

877
01:24:22.813 --> 01:24:25.114
and Böhnhardt in vain.

878
01:24:25.114 --> 01:24:29.031
(speaking in foreign language)

879
01:24:48.231 --> 01:24:49.930
This intelligence agent.

880
01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:53.578
who had helped develop the high matchup through Tino Brandt.

881
01:24:53.578 --> 01:24:56.743
could or would not help the police.

882
01:24:56.743 --> 01:25:00.660
(speaking in foreign language)

883
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:07.230
The final retreat of the terror trio was revealed

884
01:25:07.230 --> 01:25:10.139
by its third member. Beate Zschäpe.

885
01:25:10.139 --> 01:25:13.693
She set fire to the house and the frilliest asset.

886
01:25:13.693 --> 01:25:17.111
There. the investigators found final proof

887
01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:19.782
in the remains of the house.

888
01:25:19.782 --> 01:25:23.773
The cesca with which nine people had been murdered.

889
01:25:25.130 --> 01:25:29.178
Beate Zschäpe after wandering around for several days.

890
01:25:29.178 --> 01:25:31.728
turned herself in to the police.

891
01:25:31.728 --> 01:25:36.728
The National Socialist Underground. unmasked.

892
01:25:37.288 --> 01:25:41.205
(speaking in foreign language)

893
01:26:11.242 --> 01:26:13.829
Beate Zschäpe has spent years in court.

894
01:26:13.829 --> 01:26:18.073
together with former members of the Thuringian Heimatschutz.

895
01:26:19.230 --> 01:26:23.075
Most of her companions are uncommunicated as witnesses.

896
01:26:23.075 --> 01:26:27.015
and thus many of the central questions remain open.

897
01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:28.438
For the authorities.

898
01:26:28.438 --> 01:26:31.742
that were closest to the perpetrators as well.

899
01:26:31.742 --> 01:26:35.742
(speaking in foreign language)

900
01:27:26.333 --> 01:27:30.170
Thousand fulling Straza has been torn down.

901
01:27:30.170 --> 01:27:32.930
Intelligence services continue to block attempts

902
01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:34.660
to clear up the case.

903
01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:35.493
They say.
