3
00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:37.303
And don't come inside
until the screaming starts.

4
00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:45.734
Sit.

5
00:02:51.544 --> 00:02:53.511
Commune...

6
00:02:53.546 --> 00:02:55.843
or curse?

7
00:02:55.878 --> 00:02:58.714
Curse.

8
00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.388
Payment first.

9
00:03:08.924 --> 00:03:11.562
Blood now.

10
00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.305
And...

11
00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.902
what fate...

12
00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:27.908
for the owner of this blood?

13
00:03:31.276 --> 00:03:35.245
I want the devil himself
to take possession of her.

14
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.216
for both to be locked
in hell together. forever.

15
00:03:40.593 --> 00:03:43.396
Well...

16
00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.959
the devil himself

17
00:03:45.994 --> 00:03:49.897
never takes possession.

18
00:03:49.932 --> 00:03:54.572
He sends one of his legions.

19
00:03:54.607 --> 00:03:55.771
A demon?

20
00:03:55.806 --> 00:03:57.410
Mm-hmm.

21
00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:00.413
And it will be
whenever he so chooses.

22
00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.580
unless...

23
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.177
What?

24
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.818
It'll cost double.

25
00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:12.084
I'll get it. tonight.

26
00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:13.987
As soon as we finish.

27
00:04:14.022 --> 00:04:17.430
go to this person quickly.

28
00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:21.467
She may be violently ill
and have supernatural strength.

29
00:04:23.702 --> 00:04:25.834
You must take this knife

30
00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:29.838
and wait for the point
of no return.

31
00:04:29.873 --> 00:04:34.007
when the demon
has come too far.

32
00:04:34.042 --> 00:04:36.779
How do I know when that is?

33
00:04:36.814 --> 00:04:41.850
You'll see the demon's
three fingers

34
00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:48.461
emerging from the mouth
of the accursed.

35
00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:51.959
Carve a crucifix

36
00:04:51.994 --> 00:04:55.468
into the flesh of the throat.

37
00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:59.472
above the chest.

38
00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:04.169
Are you ready
to gaze into hell?

39
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.682
Yes.

40
00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:29.535
Mm.

41
00:05:33.365 --> 00:05:37.070
Come and gaze at his blaze

42
00:05:37.105 --> 00:05:39.842
of fire.

43
00:05:39.877 --> 00:05:46.519
where winged embers rise

44
00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:49.522
to kindling choir!

45
00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:53.350
He is darkness.

46
00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:58.355
He is whispers.

47
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.359
He is sweet

48
00:06:02.394 --> 00:06:07.100
inside your heart.

49
00:06:07.135 --> 00:06:09.707
He is heat.

50
00:06:09.742 --> 00:06:14.107
He is smoke...

51
00:06:15.781 --> 00:06:20.377
...in your throat.

52
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.383
What now?

53
00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:30.959
We wait for the devil
to relight his candle.

54
00:06:30.994 --> 00:06:33.764
Watch close my face.

55
00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:36.569
for the face of the accursed
will soon take mine

56
00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:38.395
but for a moment.

57
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.805
He...

58
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.335
is real.

59
00:06:45.646 --> 00:06:47.811
He...

60
00:06:49.012 --> 00:06:52.145
is imagined.

61
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.784
He...

62
00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.415
is stationed at

63
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.923
the seal.

64
00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:01.990
Ahh...

65
00:07:05.457 --> 00:07:07.798
I...

66
00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:10.603
I hear...

67
00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:13.001
a fly.

68
00:07:16.677 --> 00:07:20.173
But I... I don't...

69
00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:22.175
I don't see one.

70
00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:28.819
Do... do you hear it?

71
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.626
Only...

72
00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:35.793
the accursed...

73
00:07:35.828 --> 00:07:38.026
hears the fly!

74
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.840
Where...

75
00:07:49.875 --> 00:07:52.139
did you get...

76
00:07:52.174 --> 00:07:53.338
the blood?!

77
00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:56.143
Where did you get
this blood?!

78
00:07:56.178 --> 00:07:59.410
My daughter bled you
while you slept. witch!

79
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:05.482
My name is Mary Lynn Crandon.

80
00:08:05.517 --> 00:08:08.056
and this is
for my husband Thomas!

81
00:08:27.946 --> 00:08:29.209
Sadie!

82
00:08:56.909 --> 00:08:58.744
Next time we burn it down.

83
00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:50.113
Elly. you need me to stay?

84
00:11:50.148 --> 00:11:52.753
No. you go. I'm fine.

85
00:11:54.988 --> 00:11:56.284
Fine.

86
00:11:58.255 --> 00:11:59.925
Let's go with that.

87
00:12:01.489 --> 00:12:04.897
So. are you going
to stay in town awhile?

88
00:12:04.932 --> 00:12:08.560
Uh... probably
until I sell this place.

89
00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:12.564
I want to get back to Haiti.
they need volunteers.

90
00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:15.105
Lots of junk to clear out.
keep me busy till then.

91
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.107
True.

92
00:12:17.142 --> 00:12:19.571
I can stop by tomorrow.
help you out.

93
00:12:19.606 --> 00:12:21.474
You don't have to do that.

94
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:22.915
I want to.

95
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.445
I can bring wine.
like old times.

96
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.788
Great. Sounds good.

97
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.960
Hey. Beth?

98
00:12:34.995 --> 00:12:38.095
Thank you
for coming to the service.

99
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.932
It means a lot.

100

118

I'm sorry.
I'm always losing it.

119
00:15:49.717 --> 00:15:51.783
I've been cleaning nonstop.

120
00:15:51.818 --> 00:15:53.950
<i>Okay. well. since</i>

121
00:15:53.985 --> 00:15:55.160

125
00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:05.830
<i>The news. like.</i>
<i>it's pretty rotten.</i>

126
00:16:05.865 --> 00:16:07.304
What's going on?

127
00:16:07.339 --> 00:16:10.175
<i>They're cutting off</i>
<i>all foreign aid to Haiti.</i>

128
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:14.311
<i>I mean. no one is going</i>
<i>in or out. nobody.</i>

129
00:16:14.346 --> 00:16:15.906
Oh. shit.

130
00:16:17.349 --> 00:16:19.745
<i>Sorry.</i>

131
00:16:23.685 --> 00:16:25.322
So. I called my team leader.

132
00:16:25.357 --> 00:16:26.818
He said
the State Department issued

133
00:16:26.853 --> 00:16:28.820
a level 4 travel advisory.

134
00:16:28.855 --> 00:16:31.064
Level 4. that's bad. right?

135
00:16:31.099 --> 00:16:33.990
Right. It means I can't
get a flight back.

136
00:16:34.025 --> 00:16:36.168
I mean. the worst part is
those people still need help.

137
00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:37.697
and we're just abandoning them.

138
00:16:37.732 --> 00:16:39.336
People need help
here. too. Elly.

139
00:16:39.371 --> 00:16:41.371
We're having a blood drive
at St. Luke's tomorrow.

140
00:16:41.406 --> 00:16:42.867
You could start with that.

141
00:16:42.902 --> 00:16:44.000
Yeah. sign me up.

142
00:16:44.035 --> 00:16:47.003
Really? Now. that is
the Elly I know.

143
00:16:47.038 --> 00:16:48.840
How about we do just
one more of these big boxes

144
00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:50.347
and then pop open
the<i> Vin de Luxe.</i>

145
00:16:50.382 --> 00:16:51.711
-since this is boring.
-Okay.

146
00:16:51.746 --> 00:16:52.778
Yes!

147
00:16:54.584 --> 00:16:55.781
Elly.

148
00:16:58.126 --> 00:17:00.016
Mrs. Dudley. hi.

149
00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:02.018
I'm sorry for your loss.

150
00:17:02.053 --> 00:17:03.591
Thank you.

151
00:17:03.626 --> 00:17:05.230
It's nice of you to stop by.

152
00:17:05.265 --> 00:17:08.860
I only came by to give you back
the spare key.

153
00:17:08.895 --> 00:17:10.367
I...

154
00:17:10.402 --> 00:17:13.238
I'm sorry I wasn't
able to make the service.

155
00:17:13.273 --> 00:17:16.076
It's really all right.
don't worry about it.

156
00:17:17.574 --> 00:17:20.245
Looks like you're busy.

157
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.808
Yeah. we are.

158
00:17:27.749 --> 00:17:30.618
I was the one
who found your mother.

159
00:17:32.292 --> 00:17:34.259
Mrs. Dudley.
do you want to come inside?

160
00:17:34.294 --> 00:17:37.823
I wouldn't have gone inside
if I hadn't heard the music.

161
00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:42.432
Hey. El. where are the boxes
from the attic?

162
00:17:42.467 --> 00:17:44.060
Uh. check the kitchen.

163
00:17:44.095 --> 00:17:46.898
I'm sorry... what music?

164
00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:50.803
That old song she liked
to play. you know the one.

165
00:17:50.838 --> 00:17:53.971
I was passing by on my way
to church when I heard it.

166
00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:55.643
It was a record.

167
00:17:57.108 --> 00:17:59.845
It should have been
skipping. but...

168
00:18:01.453 --> 00:18:02.815
It just...

169
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.258
<i>♪ And I'll never leave-- ♪</i>

170
00:18:06.293 --> 00:18:08.920
I just...

171
00:18:08.955 --> 00:18:12.462
Mrs. Dudley. I'm so sorry.

172
00:18:12.497 --> 00:18:14.464
You were always a really great
neighbor to us.

173
00:18:14.499 --> 00:18:16.598
especially after my dad left.

174
00:18:16.633 --> 00:18:18.633
Do you mean when he ran off
with that whore?

175
00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:23.671
Why did you
run off on her. too. Elly?

176
00:18:23.706 --> 00:18:25.475
She was sick.

177
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.642
She had nobody.

178
00:18:27.677 --> 00:18:29.281
If you had been here.

179
00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:31.448
I wouldn't have had
to go through that horror.

180
00:18:31.483 --> 00:18:34.011
I'm sorry for what you saw.
but you have no right

181
00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:36.453
to lecture me
about my choices.

182
00:18:36.488 --> 00:18:37.949
Hey! Okay...

183
00:18:37.984 --> 00:18:40.655
I think you'd better
go now. Mrs. Dudley.

184
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.121
I haven't slept for days!

185
00:18:45.156 --> 00:18:48.124
I lie in bed at night.

186
00:18:48.159 --> 00:18:50.500
I keep seeing her face!

187
00:18:53.505 --> 00:18:56.308
I can't believe
she slapped me.

188
00:18:56.343 --> 00:18:59.509
No one would believe
that she slapped you.

189
00:18:59.544 --> 00:19:01.511
She's right.

190
00:19:01.546 --> 00:19:03.139
About what?

191
00:19:03.174 --> 00:19:04.712
Maybe I should have been here.

192
00:19:04.747 --> 00:19:07.847
Elly. you were here.
You stuck around.

193
00:19:07.882 --> 00:19:09.750
Yeah. until I didn't.

194
00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:16.724
I hated my dad
after he left her.

195
00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:19.056
Then I did the same thing.

196
00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:23.929
Well. now. your dad walked out
on his wife and his daughter.

197
00:19:25.405 --> 00:19:27.097
That is not at all
the same thing.

198
00:19:28.738 --> 00:19:31.508
All you did was
go out of this town

199
00:19:31.543 --> 00:19:32.839
and went and lived your life.

200
00:19:32.874 --> 00:19:34.346
That's normal. that is healthy.

201
00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:36.744
That is nothing
to feel guilty about.

202
00:19:41.553 --> 00:19:44.356
Shoot. that's my ride.

203
00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:46.215
Should I cancel?

204
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.756
No. No. you've got
an early start.

205
00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:52.364
But I am gonna see you

206
00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:53.860
at the blood drive
tomorrow. right?

207
00:19:53.895 --> 00:19:55.400
-Yes. I'll be there.
-Like seriously.

208
00:19:55.435 --> 00:19:57.028
You're gonna show up.
gonna be there?

209
00:19:57.063 --> 00:19:58.733
-I'm really gonna be there.
-Okay.

210
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.605
You're not your dad

211
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.378
and you're not your mom either.

212
00:20:06.413 --> 00:20:10.712
Okay? You're you.
and you're a good person.

213
00:20:10.747 --> 00:20:12.142
Remember that?

214
00:22:43.966 --> 00:22:46.538
Gamble residence.
Elly speaking.

215
00:22:46.573 --> 00:22:48.573
<i> You must be the nurse.</i>

216
00:22:50.137 --> 00:22:51.103
Who's this?

217
00:22:51.138 --> 00:22:53.369
<i>My name is Alma Whitelorn.</i>

218
00:22:53.404 --> 00:22:56.207
<i>I'm calling</i>
<i>on behalf of Ms. Ambrose.</i>

219
00:22:56.242 --> 00:22:58.715
<i>She needs a carer.</i>

220
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.750
<i>Your mother recommended you.</i>

221
00:23:02.413 --> 00:23:04.050
My mother? When?

222
00:23:04.085 --> 00:23:07.317
<i>Last week.</i>
<i>We spoke on the telephone.</i>

223
00:23:10.157 --> 00:23:11.596
I'm sorry...

224
00:23:11.631 --> 00:23:14.060
There must be a mistake.
I've been away.

225
00:23:14.095 --> 00:23:16.227
I only came home
a couple of days ago.

226
00:23:16.262 --> 00:23:18.570
<i>Your mother said you'd be</i>
<i>coming home next week</i>

227
00:23:18.605 --> 00:23:20.132
<i>and to try you then.</i>

228
00:23:20.167 --> 00:23:21.969
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>

229
00:23:30.441 --> 00:23:34.487
Do you think she had it
all planned out?

230
00:23:34.522 --> 00:23:36.786
Um. I don't know.

231
00:23:36.821 --> 00:23:37.952
Maybe.

232
00:23:39.989 --> 00:23:41.494
Ooh.

233
00:23:41.529 --> 00:23:43.287
What happened here?

234
00:23:43.322 --> 00:23:44.794
Oh. um...

235
00:23:46.028 --> 00:23:47.632
Not long after my dad left.

236
00:23:47.667 --> 00:23:49.766
I woke up
in the middle of the night

237
00:23:49.801 --> 00:23:53.330
and... my mom was
sitting there with a syringe

238
00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:55.475
and a little glass vial
and...

239
00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:58.940
she took my blood.

240
00:23:58.975 --> 00:24:00.942
Were you sick?

241
00:24:00.977 --> 00:24:02.977
I don't think so.

242
00:24:03.012 --> 00:24:05.144
That's fucked up.

243
00:24:05.179 --> 00:24:08.180
Maybe it's why
I became a nurse.

244
00:24:08.215 --> 00:24:13.119
Speaking of you
and your nursing.

245
00:24:13.154 --> 00:24:14.659
you gonna take that job?

246
00:24:14.694 --> 00:24:17.695
I don't know.
I could use the money.

247
00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:20.456
The aid program was helping me
to pay off my nursing school.

248
00:24:20.491 --> 00:24:22.535
I'm been kind of in danger
of defaulting.

249
00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.032
What about the sale
of your mom's house?

250
00:24:25.067 --> 00:24:27.496
Turns out she was
in some serious debt.

251
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:30.642
Okay. well. for once.
I cannot judge your mother.

252
00:24:30.677 --> 00:24:32.842
because we both know
that I know about debt.

253
00:24:34.505 --> 00:24:36.681
But I do think
you should take that job.

254
00:24:36.716 --> 00:24:39.310
The change of scenery
would do you a lot of good.

255
00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:40.817
Yeah. But it's out
in the sticks

256
00:24:40.852 --> 00:24:42.313
and I don't have a car.

257
00:24:42.348 --> 00:24:46.317
Okay. well. as per
my last email. I have a car.

258
00:24:46.352 --> 00:24:48.055
It's a piece of shit.
but it's a car.

259
00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.530
I'll drive. you get the gas.

260
00:24:56.428 --> 00:24:59.330
You think she did it
to punish me?

261
00:24:59.365 --> 00:25:00.672
Like trap me?

262
00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:02.674
You're not trapped.

263
00:25:02.709 --> 00:25:04.874
You're gonna sell
that musty old house

264
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:07.547
and... live your life.

265
00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:13.685
The phone call was so weird.

266
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.347
I don't even know how
my mom knew these people

267
00:25:16.382 --> 00:25:19.790
or... why she recommended me.

268
00:25:21.585 --> 00:25:24.520
<i>There. all done.</i>

269
00:25:32.299 --> 00:25:34.937
Shhh!

270
00:25:34.972 --> 00:25:37.071
Go back to sleep. Eleanor.

271
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.772
<i> Eleanor!</i>

272
00:26:40.807 --> 00:26:42.301
<i>Get in here!</i>

273
00:26:48.639 --> 00:26:50.782
Mother?

274
00:26:50.817 --> 00:26:52.982
<i>Where were you?</i>

275
00:26:53.017 --> 00:26:54.346
I told you. I...

276
00:26:54.381 --> 00:26:57.118
<i>Where... were... you?</i>

277
00:26:57.153 --> 00:26:59.186
I was volunteering...

278
00:27:56.883 --> 00:27:59.015
Look at me!

279
00:28:02.284 --> 00:28:03.888
Do you smell that?

280
00:28:03.923 --> 00:28:06.583
I pissed myself.

281
00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:07.859
And nobody came to help.

282
00:28:07.894 --> 00:28:09.586
Stop!

283
00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:12.765
You should have seen that
nosy old bitch. Mrs. Dudley.

284
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.525
"Help! Somebody. come!"

285
00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:18.034
She just opened up her big
stupid mouth and...

286
00:28:28.574 --> 00:28:30.376
Elly. come on.

287
00:28:30.411 --> 00:28:32.378
It's that crazy neighbor lady.

288
00:28:32.413 --> 00:28:35.546
she just smacked this idea
into your head.

289
00:28:35.581 --> 00:28:37.713
No. it was real.

290
00:28:40.487 --> 00:28:44.621
I mean. it felt real.

291
00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:47.624
Well. maybe you should...

292
00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:49.065
you know.

293
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.803
What?

294
00:28:50.838 --> 00:28:52.299
See someone?

295
00:28:52.334 --> 00:28:54.939
Talk about it. professionally.

296
00:28:54.974 --> 00:28:56.468
Like a psychiatrist?

297
00:28:58.142 --> 00:28:59.273
Yeah. like a...

298
00:28:59.308 --> 00:29:01.275
exactly like a psychiatrist.

299
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:03.112
Great. then I'll officially
turn into her.

300
00:29:03.147 --> 00:29:06.115
That's not possible. you're
never gonna become your mother.

301
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.151
I'm just...

302
00:29:09.186 --> 00:29:11.417
You're grieving.
and this isn't my line.

303
00:29:11.452 --> 00:29:13.320
I don't know what to do
with this stuff. but...

304
00:29:13.355 --> 00:29:16.290
you can stay with me
for as long as it takes.

305
00:29:19.361 --> 00:29:20.833
<i>♪ You're my ♪</i>

306
00:29:20.868 --> 00:29:25.937
<i>♪ Baby girl ♪</i>

307
00:29:25.972 --> 00:29:28.467
<i>♪ And I'll always ♪</i>

308
00:29:28.502 --> 00:29:32.977
<i>♪ Love you ♪</i>

309
00:29:34.343 --> 00:29:36.178
<i>♪ You-- ♪</i>

310
00:29:36.213 --> 00:29:39.346
Isn't that the record
your mom used to always play?

311
00:29:39.381 --> 00:29:42.019
She always said
it was our song.

312
00:29:42.054 --> 00:29:44.956
It was playing
when Mrs. Dudley found her.

313
00:29:44.991 --> 00:29:47.453
Then throw it in a box

314
00:29:47.488 --> 00:29:49.323
or against the wall.

315
00:29:49.358 --> 00:29:51.325
I don't think I can do that.

316
00:29:53.032 --> 00:29:54.966
But I've decided
I'm going to take the job.

317
00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:56.968
if you'll still drive me.

318
00:29:57.003 --> 00:30:00.972
Hey. hey. I am so down
to do anything

319
00:30:01.007 --> 00:30:02.974
that involves us
getting the fuck out of here.

320
00:30:03.009 --> 00:30:04.569
-Okay.
-Okay.

321
00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:15.981
What?

322
00:31:17.479 --> 00:31:19.149
Weirdly familiar.

323
00:31:20.251 --> 00:31:22.251
<i> Take my hand.</i>

324
00:31:28.919 --> 00:31:32.558
Girl. are you. like. 100% sure
you still wanna do this?

325
00:31:32.593 --> 00:31:34.725
This is really
in the middle of nowhere.

326
00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.628
Yeah. I'll be fine.

327
00:31:39.468 --> 00:31:40.896
Creepy.

328
00:31:40.931 --> 00:31:44.108
Was she always
standing right there?

329
00:31:47.773 --> 00:31:49.146
Must be Alma.

330
00:31:49.181 --> 00:31:51.775
Yay.

331
00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.183
Alma.

332
00:31:58.652 --> 00:32:01.422
Miss Campbell. Hmm.

333
00:32:01.457 --> 00:32:03.655
I'm Alma Whitelorn.

334
00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:06.097
In charge
of the Ambrose estate.

335
00:32:06.132 --> 00:32:08.000
We spoke on the telephone.

336
00:32:08.035 --> 00:32:09.496
You're late.

337
00:32:09.531 --> 00:32:11.300
Oh. yeah. sorry.

338
00:32:11.335 --> 00:32:14.435
The drive just took
a bit longer than we expected.

339
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.272
This is my friend Beth.

340
00:32:16.307 --> 00:32:17.669
Hi.

341
00:32:17.704 --> 00:32:19.506
The job's for one person.

342
00:32:19.541 --> 00:32:22.641
Oh. I'm just...
I'm just the driver.

343
00:32:22.676 --> 00:32:26.216
We're a little behind.
If you'll follow me.

344
00:32:28.352 --> 00:32:29.681
Wow.

345
00:32:39.198 --> 00:32:41.132
Refrigerator. oven.

346
00:32:41.167 --> 00:32:43.662
There's no dishwasher
and no microwave.

347
00:32:43.697 --> 00:32:45.499
I'm sure you can make do.

348
00:32:45.534 --> 00:32:46.698
Yeah. no problem.

349
00:32:46.733 --> 00:32:49.536
Help yourself to some fruit.

350
00:32:49.571 --> 00:32:51.142
You can use the fireplace.

351
00:32:51.177 --> 00:32:53.474
The nights have been
growing cold here.

352
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:55.674
A reliable landline.

353
00:32:55.709 --> 00:32:59.975
You have my phone number
in case of an emergency.

354
00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:02.846
I'll introduce you
to your patient now.

355
00:33:24.771 --> 00:33:26.573
Don't mind if I do.

356
00:33:26.608 --> 00:33:28.839
I made arrangements
for Ms. Ambrose

357
00:33:28.874 --> 00:33:30.214
to have the best
possible care.

358
00:33:30.249 --> 00:33:31.842
but they couldn't provide her

359
00:33:31.877 --> 00:33:33.382
with a private room
until Monday.

360
00:33:33.417 --> 00:33:35.846
A bed in a ward
simply wouldn't do.

361
00:33:35.881 --> 00:33:38.013
Ms. Ambrose
is a private woman.

362
00:33:38.048 --> 00:33:40.587
Does she have any family?

363
00:33:40.622 --> 00:33:42.017
A daughter.

364
00:33:42.052 --> 00:33:44.723
But she went away
some time ago.

365
00:33:44.758 --> 00:33:46.857
Where did she go?

366
00:33:46.892 --> 00:33:50.234
Your job is Ms. Ambrose.

367
00:34:07.649 --> 00:34:10.221
A precaution.
on the off chance

368
00:34:10.256 --> 00:34:12.718
Ms. Ambrose were
to become responsive.

369
00:34:12.753 --> 00:34:14.555
but that won't happen.

370
00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.888
However. I must stress that
you do not leave these grounds

371
00:34:17.923 --> 00:34:19.890
until the ambulance arrives
on Monday.

372
00:34:19.925 --> 00:34:23.630
and I won't tolerate
any alcohol on the premises

373
00:34:23.665 --> 00:34:24.796
or any visitors.

374
00:34:24.831 --> 00:34:27.062
Ms. Ambrose is a private--

375
00:34:27.097 --> 00:34:28.668
Private woman? Yeah.

376
00:34:31.475 --> 00:34:33.442
I'll show you to your room now.

377
00:35:06.312 --> 00:35:08.477
Perfect.

378
00:35:08.512 --> 00:35:12.448
I wanted to ask you
about your time volunteering.

379
00:35:12.483 --> 00:35:14.010
Yeah. of course.

380
00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:16.683
Perhaps I misread
the dates on your résumé.

381
00:35:16.718 --> 00:35:18.685
but it seems you were
caring for your mother

382
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.489
at the same time. correct?

383
00:35:22.328 --> 00:35:23.954
Yeah. um...

384
00:35:23.989 --> 00:35:26.957
My experience was
better suited to volunteering--

385
00:35:26.992 --> 00:35:29.828
It's not easy
caring for family. is it?

386
00:35:31.997 --> 00:35:34.635
No. it's not.

387
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.242
So. is this
the daughter's room?

388
00:35:38.575 --> 00:35:40.509
There are no other bedrooms.

389
00:35:42.381 --> 00:35:43.974
I really must get going.

390
00:35:44.009 --> 00:35:46.680
If you have any further
questions. I'll see you inside.

391
00:35:51.885 --> 00:35:54.149
She is a real charmer.

392
00:35:54.184 --> 00:35:57.152
Beth. can you
just not say anything else?

393
00:35:57.187 --> 00:35:59.825
Have you met me?

394
00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.333
Okay. fine. no problem.
I'll go get some air.

395
00:36:02.368 --> 00:36:04.566
I can't breathe
in here. anyway.

396
00:36:04.601 --> 00:36:08.240
Oh. yeah. and I would take
the couch if I were you.

397
00:36:08.275 --> 00:36:09.505
Why?

398
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.902
What if the daughter
comes back

399
00:36:10.937 --> 00:36:12.541
and finds Goldilocks
in her bed?

400
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:32.759
How is the apple?

401
00:36:32.794 --> 00:36:34.189
Mm.

402
00:36:34.224 --> 00:36:35.399
Biblical.

403
00:36:36.897 --> 00:36:38.193
She's crazy.

404
00:36:38.228 --> 00:36:39.568
You're fuckin' crazy
for staying.

405
00:36:39.603 --> 00:36:41.801
Well. she's not
gonna stay with me.

406
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:46.135
Okay.
there she is again. Hello.

407
00:36:47.644 --> 00:36:50.414
Half up front as agreed.
The rest on Monday.

408
00:36:50.449 --> 00:36:52.042
Thank you.

409
00:36:52.077 --> 00:36:53.780
And you'll be leaving soon?

410
00:36:53.815 --> 00:36:56.420
Yep. Right after you do.

411
00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:01.392
Um. Alma.

412
00:37:01.427 --> 00:37:05.825
Do you know how my mother
knew Ms. Ambrose?

413
00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:11.402
I believe they were
old acquaintances. no?

414
00:37:11.437 --> 00:37:12.964
Uh... maybe.

415
00:37:12.999 --> 00:37:14.933
I'm not really sure.

416
00:37:14.968 --> 00:37:17.771
Well. if that's all.
I'll say good afternoon then.

417
00:37:19.346 --> 00:37:20.774
Thanks for everything.

418
00:37:24.274 --> 00:37:26.076
Yeah. I rest my case.

419
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.431
All right. get it all out.

420
00:37:40.466 --> 00:37:43.093
Okay. for openers.
you don't have a car.

421
00:37:43.128 --> 00:37:44.765
That's why you drove me.

422
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.437
Which is exactly how I know
you don't have a car.

423
00:37:46.472 --> 00:37:48.835
Also. you barely know
how to use a cell phone.

424
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:50.265
so. what if something happens?

425
00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.674
You're in the middle
of nowhere.

426
00:37:52.709 --> 00:37:54.346
You would be
literally stranded.

427
00:37:54.381 --> 00:37:55.842
I'm looking
after a comatose woman

428
00:37:55.877 --> 00:37:57.679
in a country cabin.

429
00:37:57.714 --> 00:38:00.275
I mean. look at this place.
it's like an Airbnb.

430
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:02.519
Yeah. super nice Airbnb.

431
00:38:02.554 --> 00:38:05.181
even comes with its own
little check-in receptionist

432
00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:07.018
who's also married to Satan.

433
00:38:07.053 --> 00:38:08.657
And then the host
stays with you in a coma.

434
00:38:08.692 --> 00:38:10.285
Five-star review.

435
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.661
You're the one who talked me
into taking this job.

436
00:38:12.696 --> 00:38:14.861
Yeah. because I thought you
needed a change of scenery.

437
00:38:14.896 --> 00:38:16.995
-Yeah. this is it.
-That's not what I meant.

438
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:18.634
-Alma's gone now.
-Could you just stop?

439
00:38:18.669 --> 00:38:20.328
Shut up. just stop!

440
00:38:20.363 --> 00:38:22.671
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're not taking this job

441
00:38:22.706 --> 00:38:24.134
just because
of you and your mom.

442
00:38:24.169 --> 00:38:26.037
'cause there are
a lot of similarities here

443
00:38:26.072 --> 00:38:27.676
I can't ignore.

444
00:38:30.714 --> 00:38:33.143
Listen. I'm staying.

445
00:38:33.178 --> 00:38:35.849
And I would really appreciate
your support on this.

446
00:38:38.524 --> 00:38:40.150
Okay. fine.

447
00:38:40.185 --> 00:38:42.493
Better give me your landline
because you and phones--

448
00:38:42.528 --> 00:38:43.989
I already texted it to you.

449
00:38:44.024 --> 00:38:47.355
Oh. you do know how
to use a cell phone.

450
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:50.897
Look at you. going
into the 21st century.

451
00:38:50.932 --> 00:38:53.064
I'm proud of you.
You're fuckin' insane.

452
00:38:53.099 --> 00:38:54.868
-Really sweet. thank you.
-Yeah. I know.

453
00:38:54.903 --> 00:38:56.672
I love you too. bitch.

454
00:39:58.428 --> 00:40:00.604
Ms. Ambrose. my name is Elly.

455
00:40:00.639 --> 00:40:03.233
Now. I understand
you like your privacy

456
00:40:03.268 --> 00:40:05.939
and I respect that.
but if you need anything.

457
00:40:05.974 --> 00:40:07.941
day or night.
don't hesitate to call me.

458
00:40:07.976 --> 00:40:09.811
I'll be here.

459
00:40:11.947 --> 00:40:14.244
Okay. so I'm just going

460
00:40:14.279 --> 00:40:16.455
to pull the covers down here.

461
00:40:21.957 --> 00:40:26.531
Make sure you're nice
and tight... there.

462
00:40:36.466 --> 00:40:38.004
Ms. Ambrose.

463
00:40:38.039 --> 00:40:39.808
Hello. how are you?

464
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:18.517
<i> Eleanor!</i>

465
00:41:20.719 --> 00:41:22.081

00:46:26.321 --> 00:46:28.486
Hi. Ms. Ambrose.

483
00:46:32.393 --> 00:46:35.834
Just gonna check
your pulse here. okay?

484
00:46:37.827 --> 00:46:40.168
Blue's a good color for you.

485
00:46:40.203 --> 00:46:42.170
I'm sure you know that.

486
00:46:43.404 --> 00:46:44.799
All good.

487
00:46:44.834 --> 00:46:46.911
I think you look ready
for bed. huh?

488
00:46:48.673 --> 00:46:50.013
Me too.

489
00:46:51.577 --> 00:46:53.643
I'll just. uh...

490
00:46:53.678 --> 00:46:55.810
sit with you
for a little while.

491
00:48:12.592 --> 00:48:14.064
Hello. Ambrose residence.

492
00:48:14.099 --> 00:48:16.264
<i>Hello. Nurse Gamble.</i>

493
00:48:16.299 --> 00:48:17.793
Hey. what's up?

494
00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:19.267
<i>Just thought I'd call</i>
<i>and check in.</i>

495
00:48:19.302 --> 00:48:20.928
<i>Tried your cell.</i>
<i>but per usual.</i>

496
00:48:20.963 --> 00:48:23.073
<i>you threw it in the middle</i>
<i>of the ocean somewhere.</i>

497
00:48:23.108 --> 00:48:24.800
Sorry. I was sitting
with Ms. Ambrose

498
00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:25.900
and I had
some music playing.

499
00:48:25.935 --> 00:48:28.474
<i>Oh. it sounds romantic.</i>

500
00:48:28.509 --> 00:48:30.740
Not exactly. you weirdo.

501
00:48:30.775 --> 00:48:32.742
Oh. so I found
some old records.

502
00:48:32.777 --> 00:48:34.315
and they all had
"Dorothy Ambrose"

503
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.317
written on them--
I guess that's the daughter?

504
00:48:36.352 --> 00:48:40.090
<i>You mean the one that</i>
<i>went away some time ago?</i>

505
00:48:40.125 --> 00:48:42.125
Do you really think
she'll come back?

506
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.918
<i>Okay. are you having</i>
<i>a delayed freakout?</i>

507
00:48:43.953 --> 00:48:45.458
<i>'Cause I can</i>
<i>still come and get you.</i>

508
00:48:45.493 --> 00:48:46.756
No. I'm fine.

509
00:48:46.791 --> 00:48:48.098
Thank you for
the vote of confidence.

510
00:48:48.133 --> 00:48:49.924
<i>Listen. it turns out</i>
<i>that I'm off Sunday.</i>

511
00:48:49.959 --> 00:48:51.926
<i>so how about</i>
<i>I come down there.</i>

512
00:48:51.961 --> 00:48:54.434
<i>bring you some real food.</i>
<i>perhaps some real booze?</i>

513
00:48:54.469 --> 00:48:57.602
I mean. that does
sound tempting.

514
00:48:57.637 --> 00:48:58.933
Don't know what I'm gonna do

515
00:48:58.968 --> 00:49:00.935
with all these
microwave dinners.

516
00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:02.673
<i> Eleanor.</i>

517
00:49:03.973 --> 00:49:05.049
<i> Elly?</i>

518
00:49:08.714 --> 00:49:10.120
Yeah?

519
00:49:10.155 --> 00:49:11.990
<i>What is it?</i>

520
00:49:13.356 --> 00:49:14.949
Um... nothing.

521
00:49:14.984 --> 00:49:16.324
But I should go.

522
00:49:16.359 --> 00:49:18.953
<i>Okay. just...</i>
<i>look out for yourself. okay?</i>

523
00:49:18.988 --> 00:49:21.296
Yes. nurse.
I'll see you Sunday.

524
00:49:21.331 --> 00:49:22.330
<i>Night.</i>

525
00:49:22.365 --> 00:49:23.562
Night.

526
00:50:24.955 --> 00:50:27.758
Looks like someone's trying
to scare you is all.

527
00:50:27.793 --> 00:50:29.023
Well. they succeeded.

528
00:50:29.058 --> 00:50:30.200
I'll look into it.

529
00:50:30.235 --> 00:50:32.235
but I don't think
you need to worry. ma'am.

530
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:34.237
It's probably some kids.

531
00:50:34.272 --> 00:50:35.733
Do kids even live around here?

532
00:50:35.768 --> 00:50:37.867
It just feels pretty isolated.

533
00:50:37.902 --> 00:50:40.243
Yeah. you're right about that.
it is isolated.

534
00:50:40.278 --> 00:50:42.872
But there's some farmland
that borders the property.

535
00:50:42.907 --> 00:50:46.117
I'll ask around and see
if anybody saw anything.

536
00:50:46.152 --> 00:50:47.547
Okay.

537
00:50:47.582 --> 00:50:49.945
The place has a bit
of a history is all.

538
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.453
A history of...?

539
00:50:52.488 --> 00:50:54.554
It's superstitious stuff

540
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:56.820
that people like you and me
pay no attention to.

541
00:50:58.593 --> 00:51:00.626
But I'll check back in
if I find anything.

542
00:51:00.661 --> 00:51:02.232
How long you planning
on sticking around for?

543
00:51:02.267 --> 00:51:04.465
Just until Monday.
An ambulance is gonna come

544
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.060
take Ms. Ambrose
to the hospital.

545
00:51:06.095 --> 00:51:07.435
Dorothy took ill?

546
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:10.339
No. Dorothy's away.
I'm looking after her mother.

547
00:51:12.101 --> 00:51:14.244
Old Ms. Ambrose?

548
00:51:14.279 --> 00:51:16.444
Yeah. that's right.

549
00:51:19.108 --> 00:51:21.284
I thought she died.

550
00:51:21.319 --> 00:51:22.582
Oh. no.

551
00:51:22.617 --> 00:51:23.649
Well. she had a stroke.

552
00:51:23.684 --> 00:51:26.289
but... still hanging in there.

553
00:51:32.462 --> 00:51:33.824
All right.

554
00:51:35.124 --> 00:51:36.431
Well. I better get going.

555
00:51:36.466 --> 00:51:38.092
Yeah.

556
00:51:38.127 --> 00:51:40.127
-Good night. ma'am.
-Thank you for coming.

557
00:51:40.162 --> 00:51:41.634
Oh. any time.
Have a good night.

558
00:51:41.669 --> 00:51:42.701
Good night.

559
00:52:57.547 --> 00:52:59.349
Hey.

560
00:52:59.384 --> 00:53:00.944
What's your name?

561
00:53:03.212 --> 00:53:04.750
My name's Elly.

562
00:53:04.785 --> 00:53:06.290
You live around here?

563
00:53:14.432 --> 00:53:16.597
<i> If you insist</i>
<i>on staying there.</i>

564
00:53:16.632 --> 00:53:18.764
<i>then I insist on looking into</i>
<i>that Alma lady. for real.</i>

565
00:53:18.799 --> 00:53:20.227
<i>She creeps me out.</i>

566
00:53:20.262 --> 00:53:22.196
Okay. and how do you
propose to do that?

567
00:53:22.231 --> 00:53:24.374
<i>My dad has this investigator.</i>
<i>I think his name's Novak.</i>

568
00:53:24.409 --> 00:53:26.200
<i>He uses him only</i>
<i>in criminal cases.</i>

569
00:53:26.235 --> 00:53:27.575
<i>but he's really.</i>
<i>really good.</i>

570
00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:28.609
You're serious?

571
00:53:28.644 --> 00:53:30.237
<i>Damn straight. I'm serious.</i>

572
00:53:30.272 --> 00:53:32.580
<i>Just don't go too far</i>
<i>from that old telephone</i>

573
00:53:32.615 --> 00:53:34.912
<i>and watch your back. girl.</i>

574
00:54:38.516 --> 00:54:42.012
<i> Come and gaze</i>
<i>at his blaze of fire.</i>

575
00:54:42.047 --> 00:54:45.620
<i>where winged embers rise</i>
<i>to kindling choir!</i>

576
00:54:45.655 --> 00:54:47.281
<i>He is darkness.</i>

577
00:54:47.316 --> 00:54:49.118
<i>He is whispers.</i>

578
00:54:49.153 --> 00:54:51.120
<i>He is sweet</i>
<i>inside your heart.</i>

579
00:54:51.155 --> 00:54:52.693
<i>He is heat. he is smoke...</i>

580
00:54:52.728 --> 00:54:55.795
<i>he is fire in your throat.</i>

581
00:55:15.179 --> 00:55:17.047
Dorothy. is that you?

582
00:55:21.383 --> 00:55:24.219
My name's Elly. Alma hired me
to look after your mother.

583
00:55:24.254 --> 00:55:26.694
I hope you don't think
I'm intruding.

584
00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:53.721
Ms. Ambrose.
did you say something?

585
00:56:33.125 --> 00:56:35.763
<i> Eleanor!</i>

586
00:56:35.798 --> 00:56:39.569
<i>I told you you could</i>
<i>never leave me again.</i>

587
00:56:39.604 --> 00:56:41.571
<i>Do you hear me. Eleanor?</i>

588
00:56:41.606 --> 00:56:44.233
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

589
00:56:44.268 --> 00:56:47.775
<i>I'll always be with you!</i>

590
00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:49.304
No!

591
00:56:49.339 --> 00:56:51.482
No! No!

592
00:56:51.517 --> 00:56:52.945
No!

593
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:26.847
<i> So. what did</i>
<i>Novak find?</i>

594
00:57:26.882 --> 00:57:29.278
<i> It's what he didn't find</i>
<i>that bothers me.</i>

595
00:57:29.313 --> 00:57:31.489
a record of any Alma Whitelorn.

596
00:57:32.987 --> 00:57:35.790
Maybe she's just
a family friend helping out?

597
00:57:35.825 --> 00:57:37.154
Novak asked around.

598
00:57:37.189 --> 00:57:39.453
Nobody's ever heard
of this Alma woman.

599
00:57:39.488 --> 00:57:41.961
Far as he knows. it's just
Ms. Ambrose and a daughter.

600
00:57:41.996 --> 00:57:43.358
-Dorothy?
-Right.

601
00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:45.360
She's listed as
the mother's next-of-kin.

602
00:57:47.496 --> 00:57:49.034
Look. pumpkin.

603
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:50.805
There's something else.

604
00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:53.676
There's rumors about
this place going way back.

605
00:57:53.711 --> 00:57:55.139
Now. I know most of it sounds

606
00:57:55.174 --> 00:57:57.009
like old campfire
ghost stories to me...

607
00:57:57.044 --> 00:57:59.011
-But?
-But...

608
00:57:59.046 --> 00:58:01.046
I've never seen
my guy so spooked.

609
00:58:01.081 --> 00:58:03.048
If I were you.
I'd pull Elly out of there.

610
00:58:03.083 --> 00:58:04.852
He thinks it's
all kinds of wrong.

611
00:58:04.887 --> 00:58:07.052
-Novak said that?
-Mm-hmm.

612
00:58:07.087 --> 00:58:08.823
Fuck.

613
00:58:08.858 --> 00:58:10.891
I mean shit. I mean...

614
00:58:10.926 --> 00:58:12.222
Sorry. Dad.

615
00:58:22.938 --> 00:58:25.873
Didn't mean to startle you.

616
00:58:25.908 --> 00:58:28.337
Just paying a quick visit.

617
00:58:28.372 --> 00:58:31.714
I'm Mary Lynn Crandon.
and this is my daughter Sadie.

618
00:58:31.749 --> 00:58:33.848
Hi. I'm Elly.

619
00:58:33.883 --> 00:58:37.346
Sadie's here to apologize.

620
00:58:37.381 --> 00:58:40.591
So you were the one who threw
the apple with the note?

621
00:58:40.626 --> 00:58:42.417
She meant well. but...

622
00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:44.892
she just went about it
all wrong.

623
00:58:44.927 --> 00:58:47.092
Apologize to the lady.

624
00:58:48.931 --> 00:58:52.394
It's okay.
there's no real harm done.

625
00:58:56.774 --> 00:58:59.742
Did you wanna come in
for some coffee or...

626
00:58:59.777 --> 00:59:01.238
No.

627
00:59:01.273 --> 00:59:04.714
I have to run
some errands in town.

628
00:59:04.749 --> 00:59:06.914
I'd be happy to drop you off
at the bus station.

629
00:59:12.449 --> 00:59:13.547
What is she looking at?

630
00:59:15.419 --> 00:59:17.155
A bad memory.

631
00:59:18.587 --> 00:59:21.764
You've got no business
being here.

632
00:59:21.799 --> 00:59:24.734
I'm a nurse. I'm here
to care for Ms. Ambrose.

633
00:59:24.769 --> 00:59:27.902
I know something about
Ms. Ambrose that you don't.

634
00:59:27.937 --> 00:59:30.102
And what's that?

635
00:59:30.137 --> 00:59:32.170
She's dead.

636
00:59:45.482 --> 00:59:47.581
Um... hi. Excuse me.

637
00:59:47.616 --> 00:59:49.924
I'm looking for one of those...

638
00:59:49.959 --> 00:59:51.321
Shoot. I don't know the name.

639
00:59:51.356 --> 00:59:53.257
They're like
in all the horror movies

640
00:59:53.292 --> 00:59:56.425
and like investigator...
shows. whatever.

641
00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:57.965
They're like micro-- Oh!

642
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.769
Microfish.

643
00:59:59.804 --> 01:00:03.102
I think you mean
a "microfiche"?

644
01:00:03.137 --> 01:00:06.105
I have one.
I can show you if you like.

645
01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:08.140
I would love that.

646
01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:12.276
She's dead?

647
01:00:12.311 --> 01:00:13.816
That's not possible.

648
01:00:15.721 --> 01:00:16.984
What's in that back bedroom

649
01:00:17.019 --> 01:00:18.953
is a demon in a shell.
nothing more.

650
01:00:18.988 --> 01:00:20.152
That's enough.

651
01:00:20.187 --> 01:00:21.824
I locked them up together
in hell

652
01:00:21.859 --> 01:00:24.156
with the crucifix
I carved in her throat.

653
01:00:24.191 --> 01:00:25.795
Your daughter is right here.

654
01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:28.160
That wicked Jezebel.
Dorothy Ambrose.

655
01:00:28.195 --> 01:00:29.623
wants her mother out.

656
01:00:29.658 --> 01:00:31.163
but the only way
it will let her go

657
01:00:31.198 --> 01:00:34.001
is if it has a nice
young body to slip into.

658
01:00:34.036 --> 01:00:35.805
That's where you come in.

659
01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.632
Get out of here.
or I'll call the cops.

660
01:00:38.667 --> 01:00:40.205
And I know your daughter
has my phone.

661
01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.636
I want it back now.

662
01:00:42.671 --> 01:00:46.816
She's no thief.
She only came here to warn you.

663
01:00:46.851 --> 01:00:48.642
Why doesn't she speak

664
01:00:48.677 --> 01:00:52.019
instead of sneaking around
leaving horrible notes?

665
01:00:53.682 --> 01:00:54.857
Sadie.

666
01:00:59.061 --> 01:01:00.357
Oh. my...

667
01:01:16.111 --> 01:01:19.244
The doctors said
it looked like her tongue

668
01:01:19.279 --> 01:01:21.675
had been chewed off
in the womb.

669
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:24.678
I know that whatever did
the chewing is still in there.

670
01:01:24.713 --> 01:01:26.449
Dormant.

671
01:01:27.716 --> 01:01:29.859
I see it sometimes.

672
01:01:29.894 --> 01:01:32.257
The way she looks
right straight through me

673
01:01:32.292 --> 01:01:34.688
or when she's staring
off into space.

674
01:01:34.723 --> 01:01:37.592
But don't think I won't be
ready for the day it wakes up.

675
01:01:40.905 --> 01:01:42.267
Thomas...

676
01:01:42.302 --> 01:01:43.807
my husband?

677
01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:50.539
He gave into temptation.
just once.

678
01:01:50.574 --> 01:01:53.542
But when he tried
to break it off with Dorothy.

679
01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:56.545
she became fixated on him.

680
01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:00.219
When he rejected her.
she had a breakdown.

681
01:02:00.254 --> 01:02:02.551
She told her mother
that he'd been spreading

682
01:02:02.586 --> 01:02:04.289
filthy lies about her.

683
01:02:04.324 --> 01:02:07.424
and then she went
and ran off like a coward.

684
01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.938
"Dorothy Ambrose.
pictures from..."

685
01:02:15.973 --> 01:02:20.569
<i> So Ms. Ambrose</i>
<i>put a hex on Thomas</i>

686
01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:22.945
<i>and his unborn children.</i>

687
01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.740
<i>That's how Sadie came to be</i>
<i>one of the accursed.</i>

688
01:02:26.775 --> 01:02:32.086
What did you get
yourself into. Elly?

689
01:02:32.121 --> 01:02:36.288
I'm sorry. do you really expect
me to believe in curses?

690
01:02:36.323 --> 01:02:38.752
We were skeptics too.

691
01:02:38.787 --> 01:02:41.128
Until our second.

692
01:02:41.163 --> 01:02:43.031
Lily.

693
01:02:46.531 --> 01:02:48.971
She wasn't as strong as Sadie.

694
01:02:50.535 --> 01:02:53.338
Died a week after she was born.

695
01:02:56.475 --> 01:02:58.816
Thomas blamed himself.

696
01:03:02.184 --> 01:03:04.822
So one night
he came out here...

697
01:03:06.815 --> 01:03:08.991
and he hung himself

698
01:03:09.026 --> 01:03:10.685
from this tree.

699
01:03:12.326 --> 01:03:14.997
Sadie found him
the next morning.

700
01:03:16.528 --> 01:03:17.967
Froze pretty bad.

701
01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:19.628
Oh. my God.

702
01:03:19.663 --> 01:03:23.874
"He who is hanged
is accursed of God."

703
01:03:23.909 --> 01:03:27.009
Deuteronomy- 23.

704
01:03:28.408 --> 01:03:30.507
I'm so sorry. Mary Lynn.

705
01:03:32.577 --> 01:03:34.984
Well. I took my revenge.

706
01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:38.152
Although we're not done yet.
Sadie and me.

707
01:03:38.187 --> 01:03:41.716
Maybe you should stop now.
just call it even.

708
01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:43.025
Even?

709
01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.521
What if something
happens to Sadie?

710
01:03:44.556 --> 01:03:45.995
What if you get
yourself arrested?

711
01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:47.557
What kind of example
are you setting?

712
01:03:50.397 --> 01:03:52.936
You don't have
a daughter. do you?

713
01:03:54.434 --> 01:03:56.830
-No.
-Well. if you did.

714
01:03:56.865 --> 01:03:59.833
you'd know there's no stopping
them turning into you.

715
01:03:59.868 --> 01:04:02.209
sure as night follows day.

716
01:04:05.951 --> 01:04:08.215
She covered her neck.
didn't she?

717
01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:11.251
What?

718
01:04:11.286 --> 01:04:14.353
Look. you can bury your head
in the sand if you want.

719
01:04:14.388 --> 01:04:16.223
but mark my words.

720
01:04:16.258 --> 01:04:19.787
we will burn down this cabin.

721
01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:37.277
I thought you were
off tonight.

722
01:04:37.312 --> 01:04:38.773
-I am.
-Okay. so what did I tell you

723
01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.214
about getting yourself a life?

724
01:04:40.249 --> 01:04:41.446
Yeah. still working on that.

725
01:04:41.481 --> 01:04:43.118
Listen. if a patient
is checking into

726
01:04:43.153 --> 01:04:45.252
a private room on Monday. would
that be in the system yet?

727
01:04:45.287 --> 01:04:48.057
You trying to shack up
with the patients again. Beth?

728
01:04:48.092 --> 01:04:49.586
Uh. fuck you.

729
01:04:49.621 --> 01:04:51.885
No. I am checking
on a friend's mother.

730
01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.227
So could you do me
a huge favor

731
01:04:53.262 --> 01:04:55.625
and please just run
her name through the system?

732
01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.727
I mean. I could.
but you owe me a margarita.

733
01:04:58.762 --> 01:05:00.894
-Yeah. fine. whatever.
-Okay.

734
01:05:00.929 --> 01:05:05.272
A-M-B-R-O-S-E.

735
01:05:05.307 --> 01:05:07.934
Ambrose.

736
01:05:07.969 --> 01:05:10.948
Yeah. there's nothing here
for the next 30 days.

737
01:05:36.503 --> 01:05:38.668
<i>Eleanor.</i>

738
01:06:02.199 --> 01:06:05.167
<i>You are my baby girl.</i>

739
01:06:05.202 --> 01:06:07.301
<i>And I'll always love you.</i>

740
01:06:07.336 --> 01:06:11.503
<i>You'll be my best friend</i>
<i>'til the end.</i>

741
01:06:11.538 --> 01:06:13.505
<i>I'll never leave you.</i>

742
01:06:15.212 --> 01:06:20.017
<i>When the night is cold.</i>
<i>I'll be there to warm you.</i>

743
01:06:21.548 --> 01:06:25.011
<i>Every dream you had before.</i>

744
01:06:25.046 --> 01:06:28.025
<i>we'll make them</i>
<i>all come true.</i>

745
01:06:29.688 --> 01:06:32.821
<i>'Cause you're my baby girl.</i>

746
01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:35.692
<i>and I'll always love you.</i>

747
01:06:35.727 --> 01:06:40.367
<i>You'll be my best friend</i>
<i>'til the end.</i>

748
01:06:40.402 --> 01:06:42.996
<i>I'll never leave you.</i>

749
01:07:12.632 --> 01:07:14.599
Ms. Ambrose. can you hear me?

750
01:07:46.963 --> 01:07:49.403
Oh. no.

751
01:07:49.438 --> 01:07:53.407
<i> Sorry. this number</i>
<i>is not currently in service.</i>

752
01:07:53.442 --> 01:07:54.606
Shit.

753
01:08:10.492 --> 01:08:11.656
Shit.

754
01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.274
Come on. Elly.

755
01:08:28.873 --> 01:08:30.774
<i>Please leave your message--</i>

756
01:08:30.809 --> 01:08:31.973
Come on. goddamn it!

757
01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:14.983
-Come on. come on. come on.

758
01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:17.051
Answer the phone. damn it!

759
01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:20.659
-<i> Sorry. this number--</i>
-Fuck!

760
01:09:20.694 --> 01:09:22.364
You should just breathe.

761
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:37.862
Dad?

762
01:11:58.181 --> 01:12:01.248
<i>It'll all be over soon.</i>
<i>Eleanor. just one more.</i>

763
01:12:08.356 --> 01:12:10.158
Oh!

764
01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.943
Alma. is that you?

765
01:12:29.751 --> 01:12:32.686
-Please.

766
01:12:35.383 --> 01:12:38.890
Thank you.
little-fat-baby-jesus!

767
01:12:57.977 --> 01:12:59.647
Ms. Ambrose!

768
01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:16.158
Ms. Ambrose.

769
01:13:47.455 --> 01:13:49.092
<i>Eleanor!</i>

770
01:13:54.803 --> 01:13:58.266
<i>After Daddy abandoned us.</i>
<i>at least we had each other.</i>

771
01:13:58.301 --> 01:14:00.433
<i>But when you left too.</i>
<i>I was scared.</i>

772
01:14:00.468 --> 01:14:02.611
<i>I couldn't survive</i>
<i>without you.</i>

773
01:14:02.646 --> 01:14:04.437
<i>I had to bring you back.</i>

774
01:14:04.472 --> 01:14:07.176
<i>You'll be my best friend</i>
<i>'til the end.</i>

775
01:14:07.211 --> 01:14:08.815
<i>I'll never leave you.</i>

776
01:14:34.876 --> 01:14:36.843
Hello?

777
01:14:36.878 --> 01:14:38.647
El?

778
01:14:38.682 --> 01:14:40.473
I brought your favorite.

779
01:14:43.082 --> 01:14:44.411
Eww!

780
01:14:55.523 --> 01:14:58.227
Elly. it's me.

781
01:14:58.262 --> 01:15:00.031
Oh. my God.

782
01:15:00.066 --> 01:15:02.396
How long have you been
in here?

783
01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:06.334
I brought wine
to celebrate because

784
01:15:06.369 --> 01:15:09.876
I was on my way to save you
from that crazy house

785
01:15:09.911 --> 01:15:11.548
when I got your text.

786
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:17.543
I have so much tea to spill
on that crazy little bitch.

787
01:15:17.578 --> 01:15:19.512
I don't even know where
to start.

788
01:15:21.923 --> 01:15:24.088
Elly?

789
01:15:28.589 --> 01:15:30.567
Elly. come on.
you're freaking me out.

790
01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:18.648
You want to go downstairs?

791
01:16:47.635 --> 01:16:50.174
I know... I know...

792
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:52.440
Speak if you have
something to say!

793
01:16:52.475 --> 01:16:55.179
I know your secret.
you two-faced cunt!

794
01:16:57.183 --> 01:16:59.953
<i> You left me!</i>

795
01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:06.619
<i>I'll never leave you...</i>

796
01:17:06.654 --> 01:17:08.621
<i> Where did you go?!</i>

797
01:17:11.659 --> 01:17:14.132
<i>You're my baby girl!</i>

798
01:17:17.665 --> 01:17:20.204
<i>You left me all alone!</i>

799
01:17:20.239 --> 01:17:22.206
-Shh!

800
01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:38.387
-Open up. please.

801
01:17:38.422 --> 01:17:40.697
-It's Officer Green.
-Come in.

802
01:17:42.261 --> 01:17:43.997
Look. it's not safe here.

803
01:17:44.032 --> 01:17:45.559
Oh. you got that right.

804
01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:48.034
Now. we got a tip that a woman
named Mary Lynn Crandon

805
01:17:48.069 --> 01:17:49.695
is gonna burn this place
down tonight.

806
01:17:49.730 --> 01:17:52.236
so I came here to warn you
and escort you into town.

807
01:17:52.271 --> 01:17:53.501
Okay. great. let's go.

808
01:17:53.536 --> 01:17:55.008
What about Ms. Ambrose?

809
01:17:55.043 --> 01:17:56.713
Um...

810
01:17:58.244 --> 01:17:59.540
she's dead.

811
01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:01.047
-I thought you said--
-I know.

812
01:18:01.082 --> 01:18:02.851
I know. I was misinformed.

813
01:18:02.886 --> 01:18:04.677
She still back there?

814
01:18:04.712 --> 01:18:07.515
Look. I don't know
what the hell that thing is

815
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:10.386
in the bedroom but I
was lured here for something.

816
01:18:10.421 --> 01:18:13.026
-Lured?

817
01:18:13.061 --> 01:18:15.688
I thought you said
she was dead.

818
01:18:15.723 --> 01:18:17.690
We need to leave now.

819
01:18:17.725 --> 01:18:19.527
I'm not leaving
some old sick woman

820
01:18:19.562 --> 01:18:21.430
to be burnt up in her bed
by some nut.

821
01:18:21.465 --> 01:18:24.532
-Look. you can't go back there.

822
01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:27.744
You can wait out front
with my partner if you like.

823
01:18:30.573 --> 01:18:31.704
Fuck!

824
01:18:31.739 --> 01:18:34.883
Officer Green.
don't go in there!

825
01:18:34.918 --> 01:18:36.918
Just wait outside.

826
01:18:40.825 --> 01:18:42.715
Ms. Ambrose?

827
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:45.091
Ma'am. are you in here?

828
01:18:47.128 --> 01:18:48.930
-Oh!

829
01:19:11.779 --> 01:19:14.252
-Open up!
-Back away from the door!

830
01:19:14.287 --> 01:19:15.583
Get out of there now!

831
01:19:15.618 --> 01:19:17.750
Step away
from the door!

832
01:19:17.785 --> 01:19:20.324
She's not human.
you have to get out!

833
01:19:20.359 --> 01:19:21.754
Officer Green. please!

834
01:19:21.789 --> 01:19:24.130
Please listen to me.
I was set up!

835
01:19:24.165 --> 01:19:26.968
You have got to get out!
Please! Please!

836
01:19:27.003 --> 01:19:29.597
Just listen to me.
you have to listen to me.

837
01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:31.269
You have to get out now!

838
01:19:33.537 --> 01:19:38.342
Officer Green. open the door
right now!

839
01:19:38.377 --> 01:19:39.607
Please!

840
01:19:41.182 --> 01:19:42.775
Please!

841
01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:44.777
What the fuck?

842
01:19:55.691 --> 01:19:57.196
Officer Green?

843
01:20:19.682 --> 01:20:21.517
Help!

844
01:20:23.422 --> 01:20:25.818
-Officer!
-What happened to you?

845
01:20:25.853 --> 01:20:27.523
Uh-- It's a long story.

846
01:20:27.558 --> 01:20:29.657
Wait. where is my partner?

847
01:20:29.692 --> 01:20:30.658
She killed him.

848
01:20:30.693 --> 01:20:32.231
-Who?
-Ms. Ambrose.

849
01:20:32.266 --> 01:20:34.365
I need to find out
what the hell's going on here.

850
01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.597
Get in that house--

851
01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:46.883
Beth?

852
01:20:49.877 --> 01:20:52.845
Oh. Beth. Oh. my God.

853
01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.220
It's gonna be okay.

854
01:21:08.632 --> 01:21:10.973
I'm so tired.

855
01:21:31.919 --> 01:21:33.996
Alma? What did you do?

856
01:21:53.281 --> 01:21:54.907
Alma. please...

857
01:21:54.942 --> 01:21:56.414
<i>Now. hush.</i>

858
01:21:56.449 --> 01:21:58.449
<i>This won't hurt a bit. Eleanor.</i>

859
01:22:01.487 --> 01:22:03.784
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

860
01:22:06.459 --> 01:22:08.294
There. there.

861
01:22:08.329 --> 01:22:10.428
All done.

862
01:22:10.463 --> 01:22:11.924
Where is she?

863
01:22:11.959 --> 01:22:14.135
Shh!

864
01:22:14.170 --> 01:22:17.105
Your mother brought you here
a long time ago.

865
01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.833
You were just a girl.

866
01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:22.440
I gave you an apple.

867
01:22:22.475 --> 01:22:25.509
She wanted to put a curse
on your deadbeat daddy.

868
01:22:25.544 --> 01:22:27.775
but she didn't have
any money to pay with.

869
01:22:27.810 --> 01:22:29.117
so she paid in blood.

870
01:22:29.152 --> 01:22:30.943
Your blood. Elly.

871
01:22:30.978 --> 01:22:32.945
-A curse for a curse.

872
01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:34.617
My mother stored it
in the cellar

873
01:22:34.652 --> 01:22:36.124
in case she'd ever need it.

874
01:22:36.159 --> 01:22:37.785
but you destroyed it tonight.

875
01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:39.721
and now I'm
calling in the debt.

876
01:22:42.726 --> 01:22:45.859
You're out
of your fucking mind.

877
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.962
Your mother always knew
this day would come.

878
01:22:49.997 --> 01:22:52.536
That's why she came back.

879
01:22:52.571 --> 01:22:55.968
That's why she hanged herself.

880
01:22:56.003 --> 01:22:57.145
to offer you up.

881
01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:59.004
It's your fate. Elly.

882
01:22:59.039 --> 01:23:03.250
Then why did you have to kill
Beth. you psycho bitch?

883
01:23:13.856 --> 01:23:15.394
It's a catchy song.

884
01:23:15.429 --> 01:23:17.495
I can see why
you hum it all the time.

885
01:23:18.861 --> 01:23:21.532
Wait. wait. wait! Wait.

886
01:23:21.567 --> 01:23:24.997
Dorothy... I know you're
Ms. Ambrose's daughter.

887
01:23:25.032 --> 01:23:27.208
You don't
have to pretend anymore.

888
01:23:27.243 --> 01:23:29.375
I get what it's like
to look after a sick parent.

889
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:31.003
You were right. it's not easy.

890
01:23:31.038 --> 01:23:33.676
Believe me. I know.

891
01:23:33.711 --> 01:23:36.844
Listen. Mary Lynn
told me everything.

892
01:23:36.879 --> 01:23:40.188
I don't blame you
for running away.

893
01:23:40.223 --> 01:23:41.684
Fuck.

894
01:23:41.719 --> 01:23:43.752
I lied to you about
why I was volunteering.

895
01:23:43.787 --> 01:23:46.018
I couldn't handle
looking after my mother.

896
01:23:46.053 --> 01:23:48.361
I was scared of her. I was
scared of turning into her.

897
01:23:48.396 --> 01:23:51.232
so I ran way.
just like my dad.

898
01:23:53.269 --> 01:23:54.730
I left her

899
01:23:54.765 --> 01:23:58.371
when she needed me most.

900
01:23:58.406 --> 01:24:00.406
And she killed herself.

901
01:24:02.245 --> 01:24:04.410
I know your pain. Dorothy.

902
01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:10.548
My name is Alma.

903
01:24:27.963 --> 01:24:31.140
There's your friend.

904
01:24:31.175 --> 01:24:32.438
In your face!

905
01:24:32.473 --> 01:24:34.902
Always had an answer
for everything!

906
01:24:34.937 --> 01:24:36.805
Well. I fooled her. didn't I?

907
01:24:38.479 --> 01:24:40.644
Now. swallow her down!

908
01:24:51.151 --> 01:24:53.822
This is a ritual
my mother taught me.

909
01:24:58.697 --> 01:25:00.433
Are you ready...

910
01:25:00.468 --> 01:25:02.699
to gaze into hell?

911
01:25:18.486 --> 01:25:21.289
"Come and gaze
at his blaze of fire.

912
01:25:21.324 --> 01:25:25.293
where winged embers rise
to kindling choir!"

913
01:25:25.328 --> 01:25:27.955
"He is darkness.
he is whispers.

914
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:30.463
he is sweet inside
your heart."

915
01:25:30.498 --> 01:25:33.301
"He is heat. he is smoke.

916
01:25:33.336 --> 01:25:35.798
he is fire in your throat."

917
01:25:35.833 --> 01:25:38.163
Ms. Ambrose?

918
01:25:38.198 --> 01:25:40.704
"I invite you
to rise out of your shell."

919
01:25:40.739 --> 01:25:45.346
"I implore you
to visit us from hell."

920
01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:50.879
He is coming
for his fresh vessel!

921
01:25:57.261 --> 01:25:59.723
Yes!

922
01:26:02.189 --> 01:26:03.199
No...

923
01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.565
What's happening?

924
01:26:08.767 --> 01:26:10.833
No...

925
01:26:10.868 --> 01:26:13.902
-What's happening to her?

926
01:26:33.396 --> 01:26:34.527
Take her!

927
01:26:37.631 --> 01:26:38.762
You!

928
01:26:41.228 --> 01:26:42.601
Curse you!

929
01:26:45.408 --> 01:26:47.573
You tried that already.

930
01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:23.235
"Demon. O Demon.
take back now to part

931
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:25.809
well of flame
that floods the heart."

932
01:27:25.844 --> 01:27:28.977
"Demon. O Demon.
return to thine host.

933
01:27:29.012 --> 01:27:32.145
rejoin thine legion.
abandon this host!"

934
01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:34.081
-"Retreat now. O Dark One."

935
01:27:34.116 --> 01:27:36.149
"Scatter your ashes
to the winds."

936
01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:38.954
"He's brightness.
he's singing.

937
01:27:38.989 --> 01:27:40.956
he's the balance
for the blood."

938
01:27:42.993 --> 01:27:45.598
"He is ice. he is pain.

939
01:27:45.633 --> 01:27:48.095
he is lightning.
and he is rain."

940
01:28:34.077 --> 01:28:35.681
Let's go!

941
01:28:46.925 --> 01:28:49.860
<i> Eleanor!</i>

942
01:28:49.895 --> 01:28:51.367

943
01:30:19.446 --> 01:30:21.083
