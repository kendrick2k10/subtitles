3
00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.070
Hate crimes against Asian Americans are on

4
00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:31.239
the rise.

5
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.008
Every disease has ever came from China!

6
00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.427
Everything comes from China.

7
00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:54.387
You guys are disgusting!

8
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.152
The China Virus

9
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.249
At least 3.000 anti-Asian incidents since

10
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.418
February

11
00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:33.342
Asia!

12
00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.094
Oh my God!

13
00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.095
Out of here!

14
00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:42.351
We don't want you here. That's why

15
00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:45.188
we elected President Trump!

16
00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:03.873
I'll kill you! I'll decapitate you!

17
00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.317
We did everything we could.

18
00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:13.985
I'm sorry.

19
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.866
My thoughts and prayers are with

20
00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:21.867
you and your family

21
00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:28.749
I always done my job to protect

22
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.668
Rob. but this? This is something

23
00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.545
I never saw in a million years.

24
00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.631
Shit. Joe. It ain't your fault. It's those

25
00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.217
damn Chinese spreading this shit!

26
00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.886
Rob might get it next. Hell. any of us

27
00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.096
could be next.

28
00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.226
Rob ain’t the same.

29
00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:47.684
I feel like he don't even wanna

30
00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:48.853
fight anymore.

31
00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.355
I've seen it in the gym.

32
00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:52.522
It's like he's got nothing to fight

33
00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:53.191
for.

34
00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.235
Well. let's give him something.

35
00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.153
What do you mean?

36
00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.029
What are we suppose to do?

37
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.030
Just sit here and offer our

38
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.030
condolences?

39
00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.157
His momma just died!

40
00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.367
I get that!

41
00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.493
God rest her soul. but we still

42
00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:05.494
got life in us.

43
00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.039
We're acting like we're next or somethin.

44
00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.290
I know there's still life in Rob

45
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.708
but if we don't give him something to

46
00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.418
fight for. he's just gonna end up

47
00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.629
drunk. drugged up.

48
00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:17.465
What do you suggest we do?

49
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.551
If it wasn't for COVID. his momma

50
00:04:21.552 --> 00:04:22.929
still be alive today.

51
00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.016
So I say he fights to avenge her.

52
00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:29.434
You saying we should have Rob

53
00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.435
fight in China?

54
00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:31.937
No I'm saying we have Rob's next

55
00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.773
opponent be Chinese

56
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.567
and we beat his ass!

57
00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:38.069
And make an example of him.

58
00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:39.362
A super fight!

59
00:04:39.363 --> 00:04:41.405
Rodeo against the biggest Chinese boxer

60
00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:42.406
for the title.

61
00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:45.117
That way. Rob's got something to fight

62
00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.495
for. And we make a shit ton of money.

63
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.039
The problem being. Ain't no Chinese people

64
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040
big in boxing.

65
00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:53.418
Nobody?

66
00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.586
Nobody anyone will pay to see.

67
00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:57.421
No Chinese?

68
00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.006
None.

69
00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:02.798
Then we'll just open it up.

70
00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.764
Chinese. Asian. whatever the fuck.

71
00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.598
If you can fight. you have a

72
00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.184
chance with the champ.

73
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.760
We just gotta find someone that

74
00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:16.399
Rob can beat the shit out of.

75
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.361
Fucking loser!

76
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.698
Oh my God. Zeus!

77
00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:08.326
Look at your face!

78
00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:10.495
I'm alright mom.

79
00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.371
Huh? You’re ugly now!

80
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.538
Mom. I'm fine.

81
00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:14.499
God. please!

82
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.500
Stop this boxing now.

83
00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:18.627
Mom. I’m not going to stop boxing.

84
00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:19.629
alright. I just won!

85
00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:21.714
Oh yea? How much?

86
00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:24.217
Not much.

87
00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:25.343
How much?

88
00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:29.346
Thirty-six dollars.

89
00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.014
Thirty-six?

90
00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:35.686
You risk your life for thirty-six dollars?

91
00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:39.690
Please! Stop this boxing now.

92
00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:42.109
And and just be a nurse!

93
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.819
Mom. I don’t wanna be a nurse.

94
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.988
Fine. then just work at the post office.

95
00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:49.241
It’s a stable job. Zeus.

96
00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.742
See. that’s why I don’t want to

97
00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:51.910
live here anymore.

98
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.245
You always tell me to find a stable

99
00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:53.996
job.

100
00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:55.831
Like I'm trying to fight for my dream

101
00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:56.416
here.

102
00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:57.834
Oh. my God.

103
00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.085
You’re going to give me

104
00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:00.211
heart attack.

105
00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.338
You want to give me a heart attack?

106
00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:03.922
Mom. calm down.

107
00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:06.508
Please! Stop this fighting.

108
00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.509
No!

109
00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.345
Then I'm gonna die!

110
00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:12.097
I’m gonna die. Zeus!

111
00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.599
Oh. that’s what you want?

112
00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:16.185
Oh. okay you want me to die.

113
00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.502
Lord. God.

114
00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:44.838
Please strengthen me to be the next

115
00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.591
Boxing World Champion.

116
00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:50.385
Please allow my mom to be proud

117
00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:51.386
of me.

118
00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:54.974
And please Lord. allow me

119
00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:56.683
to never

120
00:07:57.393 --> 00:07:58.769
become a nurse

121
00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:28.591
When I’m all alone and far away.

122
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:38.601
Floating further into outer space.

123
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:45.023
I can count on you

124
00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:51.321
to remind me of my gravity and

125
00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:59.037
pull me back to earth

126
00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:03.876
I can count on you

127
00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:28.150
How you holdin up?

128
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:34.823
I’m doing alright.

129
00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.742
I know you got a lot going on now.

130
00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.327
I just wanted to say

131
00:09:39.328 --> 00:09:40.870
Your momma. she meant the

132
00:09:40.871 --> 00:09:41.871
World to us.

133
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.169
I appreciate that.

134
00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:48.670
Which is why I wanted to bring

135
00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:49.671
something up to you.

136
00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:52.717
What’s that?

137
00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:55.969
See these Chinese they

138
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.430
started this virus.

139
00:09:58.848 --> 00:09:59.931
And now we got thousands

140
00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.726
of people dying all over America.

141
00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:02.977
I mean. hadn’t started with

142
00:10:02.978 --> 00:10:06.314
them. your momma would still be alive.

143
00:10:07.898 --> 00:10:09.858
This is the greatest country on

144
00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:11.027
the face of the earth.

145
00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:13.236
Are we going to let this virus keep

146
00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:15.864
Killing our people? Killing our moral?

147
00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.283
Our hope?

148
00:10:18.242 --> 00:10:19.993
I say we fight back.

149
00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.328
For your momma.

150
00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:22.329
For America.

151
00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.290
I say we put a Chinese boxer

152
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.459
In the ring and you beat the

153
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.794
shit out of him.

154
00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:29.837
Show him what happens when

155
00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.005
You fuck with America.

156
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.717
Son. they took your momma.

157
00:10:38.095 --> 00:10:40.055
Well. let’s take their fucking heads off

158
00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:41.390
in the ring.

159
00:11:02.244 --> 00:11:03.245
Zeus!

160
00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:04.455
Hey! What’s going on?

161
00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.790
What’s up. man?

162
00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:07.518
I heard you won your fight last night.

163
00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.459
Damn right I did.

164
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.795
Ah. that’s what I like to hear.

165
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.006
I also heard Lorenzo quit.

166
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.425
He was giving me bad advice.

167
00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:20.096
Ok. Ok. I understand.

168
00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:23.140
I also heard you were thrown out.

169
00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:26.560
They only gave me thirty-six dollars.

170
00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.563
And? So you hit him?

171
00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:32.191
You lucky you even got that.

172
00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.694
You gotta build your record up.

173
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:36.236
You don’t just get a shot at the

174
00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:36.737
World Title.

175
00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:38.739
You gotta build your way up there.

176
00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:41.324
You're not even paying attention to me

177
00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:42.325
right now!

178
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:43.744
Who’s that?

179
00:11:46.163 --> 00:11:46.747
That guy?

180
00:11:46.747 --> 00:11:47.747
Yeah.

181
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.625
You don’t wanna fuck with him.

182
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.711
He only trains black fighters.

183
00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:53.087
Why's that?

184
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:55.380
I just heard he’s from the streets.

185
00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.340
And he only trains people from

186
00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:58.341
the streets.

187
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.177
But forget about him.

188
00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:02.178
You follow my plan. You be

189
00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:03.263
making the big bucks.

190
00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:04.639
And then you can hire whoever

191
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.599
you want.

192
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.183
You always say that shit. man.

193
00:12:07.184 --> 00:12:08.852
I’m tired of being broke.

194
00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:09.978
You know how embarrassing it is to

195
00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:11.147
live at home with your mom?

196
00:12:12.773 --> 00:12:15.359
You’re Asian! It’s cool!

197
00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.361
You can stay at home until

198
00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:18.570
you’re like forty.

199
00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:19.530
You think I want to live at home with

200
00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:20.906
my mom till I’m forty?

201
00:12:21.615 --> 00:12:22.950
Well. you can always be a nurse.

202
00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:24.368
Man. fuck you.

203
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.077
What?

204
00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:27.288
I’m just saying. it’s a noble job.

205
00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:29.622
Plus they pay well.

206
00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:31.666
And besides. you’re Filipino.

207
00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:33.585
All nurses are Filipino.

208
00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:34.545
Man. the only time I want to

209
00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:35.712
see a nurse Is in the ring

210
00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:37.173
when I knock out my next opponent.

211
00:12:37.506 --> 00:12:39.007
And speaking of my next opponent.

212
00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:40.248
You got that set up for me yet?

213
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.801
I’m working on it.

214
00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:43.304
Man. you always say that shit.

215
00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:45.722
Let me ask you.

216
00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:47.307
Have I ever failed you?

217
00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:48.434
Yes

218
00:12:50.394 --> 00:12:52.270
Well. have you ever lost a fight?

219
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:54.773
No. but I control whether I win or lose.

220
00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.191
You control who goes in the

221
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.067
ring with me.

222
00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:58.276
Do your job or I’m going to find

223
00:12:58.277 --> 00:12:59.111
somebody else.

224
00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:00.570
Don’t talk to me like that.

225
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:03.615
Look. I'll do my job. You just

226
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.034
worry about knocking them out.

227
00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:06.951
I’m gonna get out of here.

228
00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:08.662
You did a good job last night.

229
00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:12.457
Almost forgot to put on this mask.

230
00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.251
You know this Corona virus shit.

231
00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:16.336
You don’t know about it because

232
00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:17.087
you’re Asian.

233
00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:18.546
Whoa. whoa what's that supposed

234
00:13:18.547 --> 00:13:19.547
to mean?

235
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:20.757
You’re immune to it.

236
00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.759
Why would I be immune to it?

237
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.594
You’re Asian.

238
00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.053
It started in Asia.

239
00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:26.805
I’m Filipino American. man.

240
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:27.972
I was born here in LA.

241
00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:31.184
I know. But you know what I mean.
You know that.

242
00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:32.227
No. I don’t know what you mean.

243
00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:32.728
man!

244
00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:34.437
Man. stop being a fucking racist.

245
00:13:34.438 --> 00:13:35.814
I’m not racist.

246
00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.191
I’m just telling you the facts.

247
00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:38.733
The facts is you don’t have to be

248
00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:40.110
Asian to have the Coronavirus.

249
00:13:42.112 --> 00:13:43.531
I’m just following the news.

250
00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.199
Just get out of here.

251
00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:56.960
You don’t hear them talking about

252
00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.044
COVID.

253
00:13:58.045 --> 00:14:01.881
COVID. To be specific. COVID-19.

254
00:14:01.882 --> 00:14:04.467
That name gets further and further away

255
00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:06.803
from China as opposed to calling it

256
00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:08.806
“The Chinese Virus”.

257
00:14:16.313 --> 00:14:19.108
And despite the fact that we. I

258
00:14:19.316 --> 00:14:21.735
have done a phenomenal job with it.

259
00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:28.492
Aye bro.

260
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:29.118
What?

261
00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:29.702
Check it out.

262
00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:30.702
What the fuck?

263
00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:31.328
Fuck that!

264
00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:32.538
Yo get that shit!

265
00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:35.833
Hey old man!

266
00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:36.875
What’s up old man?

267
00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:37.835
Get the fuck out of here!

268
00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.002
You know where you at?

269
00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:40.336
Looks like you need some hand sanitizer.

270
00:14:40.337 --> 00:14:41.088
Just get out of here. man!

271
00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:42.399
Spreading the fucking virus out here.

272
00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:43.590
You need some hand sanitizer. buddy?

273
00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:44.300
We don’t like that shit.

274
00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:45.801
Nobody likes that shit.

275
00:14:50.514 --> 00:14:51.140
Hey!

276
00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:52.308
Get the fuck out of here.

277
00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:56.644
Why you messing with an old man for?

278
00:14:56.645 --> 00:14:58.229
What? You want some too?

279
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.314
What he ever do to you?

280
00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.315
This!

281
00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.963
We greatly appreciate y’all being here.

282
00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.797
Now this is a tough time.

283
00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:26.008
For all of us.

284
00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:29.385
As difficult as a time it is. we

285
00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:30.929
would like to announce that this will

286
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.222
be the last fight of Rob Rodeo

287
00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:34.308
Cooper’s career.

288
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:37.728
But. but with that said

289
00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:39.896
We would also like to announce.

290
00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:43.149
That Rob would be given an opportunity

291
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.526
For a shot at the title to anyone

292
00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:46.570
Would like to apply.

293
00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:48.489
What do you mean by anyone?

294
00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.532
Rodeo understands how hard it is to

295
00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:52.785
become world Champion.

296
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.953
How sometimes It’s unfair that

297
00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:56.120
Up and coming fighters have to

298
00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:57.539
make their way up the ranks.

299
00:15:58.165 --> 00:15:59.791
So Rob would like to give this

300
00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.461
unique opportunity to the right person.

301
00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.712
All they have to do is
apply on our website.

302
00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:06.506
And we will announce who the

303
00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:07.716
lucky opponent will be.

304
00:16:08.258 --> 00:16:10.260
Or. unlucky should we say.

305
00:16:10.844 --> 00:16:12.845
Why now in these tough times?

306
00:16:12.846 --> 00:16:13.846
Why so soon?

307
00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:15.933
Didn’t your mother just pass?

308
00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:21.480
I believe that fighting
is the thing I do best.

309
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.940
Hell. It’s the only thing I know

310
00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:25.150
how to do.

311
00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:29.071
But. with my mother gone.

312
00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.867
I feel like there’s
nothing left to fight for.

313
00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:37.496
But my team

314
00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:41.959
Coach Bundy. Luke Mahoney.

315
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.420
The only family I have left.

316
00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:48.589
They brought to my attention what

317
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:49.590
I must fight for now.

318
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:51.509
And that is?

319
00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:54.679
Justice.

320
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.305
And how will you do that?

321
00:16:56.306 --> 00:16:58.016
Find out on October 10th.

322
00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:58.767
Thank you very much.

323
00:16:58.768 --> 00:16:59.935
Wait. just one more question!

324
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.894
Can you tell us who you’re

325
00:17:00.894 --> 00:17:01.395
going to pick?

326
00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:02.980
Who gave you this idea?

327
00:17:12.072 --> 00:17:13.114
Oh. hi auntie Zeta.

328
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:14.741
Morning. Zeus.

329
00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:16.035
Where’s your mom?

330
00:17:16.076 --> 00:17:18.327
Oh. she’s at the grocery store.

331
00:17:18.328 --> 00:17:19.412
Grocery store?

332
00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:21.331
She asked me to color her hair.

333
00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:22.583
Oh. sorry auntie

334
00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:28.713
You still boxing?

335
00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:29.714
Yes. auntie.

336
00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.841
Gorilla in Manilla.

337
00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:33.468
Zeus. you’re not from Manilla.

338
00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:34.803
You’re an Am-Boy.

339
00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:36.679
What’s an Am-Boy?

340
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.515
American Boy.

341
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:43.102
No. I understand a little.

342
00:17:43.103 --> 00:17:44.480
Have you ever been to Manila?

343
00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:47.149
No. when I was young. yeah.

344
00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:49.358
You’re an adult now.

345
00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:50.818
So start acting like one.

346
00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:52.738
Stop wasting your life in this boxing.

347
00:17:52.821 --> 00:17:54.322
You’re too old. Zeus.

348
00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:55.240
Gorilla in Manilla.

349
00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:56.450
You’re not even a gorilla.

350
00:17:56.992 --> 00:17:58.702
People say I fight like one. auntie.

351
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:00.370
But are you a gorilla?

352
00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:01.788
No.

353
00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:03.831
You’re getting older. your mom is

354
00:18:03.832 --> 00:18:04.374
getting older.

355
00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:05.708
Who’s going to take care of her?

356
00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:06.709
A gorilla?

357
00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:08.587
I’ll take care of her.

358
00:18:08.962 --> 00:18:10.756
Grow up. Zeus.

359
00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:13.299
Get a stable job. make good money!

360
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.051
How much money are you

361
00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:15.051
making now?

362
00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:17.513
Not much.

363
00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.347
Not much?

364
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:20.598
All this boxing. boxing and you’re

365
00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:21.642
making nothing. nothing.

366
00:18:21.725 --> 00:18:23.102
Don’t be a loser.

367
00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.609
Don’t you pity your mom?

368
00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:32.110
She works two jobs

369
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.987
just to support both of you.

370
00:18:34.404 --> 00:18:35.906
Two jobs. Zeus!

371
00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:37.573
You Am-Boys have no

372
00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:39.033
respect for us.

373
00:18:39.034 --> 00:18:41.035
You have no idea what

374
00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:43.038
we went through to get to this country.

375
00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:46.707
All you do is waste your life pursuing

376
00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:48.376
these dreams while we break

377
00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:49.878
our backs to support you.

378
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.340
You are not a true Filipino.

379
00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:10.774
You did great Rob.

380
00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:12.818
Now we wait.

381
00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:14.902
I like how you sold that

382
00:19:14.903 --> 00:19:16.321
equal oppportunity bullshit.

383
00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:19.825
We got to.

384
00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:21.618
Otherwise they’ll say we’re racist.

385
00:19:22.452 --> 00:19:24.163
We want people to see this fight.

386
00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:26.330
At the end of the day. it ain’t about

387
00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:29.083
being white or black or yellow

388
00:19:29.084 --> 00:19:34.047
It is all all about the green.

389
00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:35.965
Hey fellas.

390
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:39.595
I think we found our guy.

391
00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:44.224
Oh. shit!

392
00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:47.895
You believe that shit?

393
00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:50.814
Oh. hell yeah.

394
00:19:57.487 --> 00:19:59.280
Anak. can you help me?

395
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:00.657
There’s more in the trunk.

396
00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:28.768
Zeus!

397
00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:30.270
Where you going?

398
00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:32.688
I’m going to the gym. uncle.

399
00:20:32.689 --> 00:20:33.523
Come here!

400
00:20:33.524 --> 00:20:35.107
Let me talk to you first.

401
00:20:35.108 --> 00:20:36.400
I want to know what’s happening

402
00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:37.401
in your life.

403
00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:39.070
I’ll only take a few minutes of

404
00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:39.488
your time.

405
00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:40.488
Come

406
00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:46.536
So

407
00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:48.829
What’s going on in your life. anak?

408
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.082
Nothing much. uncle.

409
00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:51.792
Just training for my next fight.

410
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.460
You’re still boxing?

411
00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:55.461
Yes. uncle.

412
00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:58.298
You’re too old for that. Zeus.

413
00:20:58.882 --> 00:21:00.341
That’s just a dream.

414
00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.802
I always tell him that.

415
00:21:02.469 --> 00:21:03.762
He doesn’t listen to me.

416
00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:06.764
I still believe in this dream. uncle.

417
00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:08.517
Well. you need to wake up.

418
00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:11.311
You’re not getting any younger.

419
00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:15.607
Pretty soon. another year will go by.

420
00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:17.526
And then five years

421
00:21:18.193 --> 00:21:20.237
and then you’ll be old like me.

422
00:21:21.905 --> 00:21:24.366
You need to find a good stable job.

423
00:21:25.033 --> 00:21:26.368
A government job.

424
00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:28.744
Have you ever think about uh

425
00:21:28.745 --> 00:21:29.871
joining the Navy?

426
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.123
Yes.

427
00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:32.708
It’s a good paying job.

428
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.876
With benefits.

429
00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:38.130
And you got to serve your country.

430
00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:41.048
You know I was in the Navy for

431
00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:42.259
twenty years.

432
00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:44.678
It’s how I came to America.

433
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.888
I got to see the world.

434
00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:48.807
Buy a house.

435
00:21:49.182 --> 00:21:50.642
And live a good life.

436
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.269
I’ll think about it.

437
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.936
You say think about it

438
00:21:53.937 --> 00:21:55.188
but nothing happens.

439
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.649
Write it down.

440
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.068
Make a plan or something.

441
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:02.361
Come on!

442
00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:05.073
You have to help your mom here.

443
00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:07.409
You’re her only son.

444
00:22:08.702 --> 00:22:10.120
When she gets old.

445
00:22:10.954 --> 00:22:11.954
no one’s going to take care

446
00:22:11.955 --> 00:22:12.955
of her

447
00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:15.125
I mean look at her

448
00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:17.836
She works just for you.

449
00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.920
And what do you give her

450
00:22:19.921 --> 00:22:20.921
in return?

451
00:22:22.466 --> 00:22:23.466
See?

452
00:22:23.717 --> 00:22:24.760
Nothing!

453
00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:27.220
Aren’t you ashamed?

454
00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:31.933
I’ll take care of her uncle.

455
00:22:31.975 --> 00:22:33.310
With what?

456
00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:34.685
When I win these fights…

457
00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.145
You have no money!

458
00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:37.188
When I win these fights

459
00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.230
I’ll have enough money.

460
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:39.358
There you go again.

461
00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:41.777
Dreaming.

462
00:22:42.819 --> 00:22:44.404
You’re a dreamer. Zeus.

463
00:22:45.405 --> 00:22:46.990
If you join the Navy.

464
00:22:47.282 --> 00:22:48.784
at least you have money.

465
00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:50.368
And then you can do whatever

466
00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:51.369
you want.

467
00:22:52.287 --> 00:22:54.872
Right now. all you do is

468
00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:56.625
beg your mom for money.

469
00:22:57.376 --> 00:23:00.003
“Mommy. can I have twenty dollars?”

470
00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:02.672
“Mommy. can I have money for gas?”

471
00:23:03.507 --> 00:23:05.008
Your uncle is right. Zeus.

472
00:23:05.425 --> 00:23:07.844
I’m tired of working two jobs.

473
00:23:08.011 --> 00:23:10.012
Mom. just wait a little longer. okay

474
00:23:10.013 --> 00:23:11.389
I got another fight coming up

475
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:12.724
And if I win…

476
00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:13.974
See!

477
00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:15.519
There it is!

478
00:23:16.603 --> 00:23:17.603
"If!"

479
00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:19.897
You see...

480
00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:23.819
Me and your mom grew up poor.

481
00:23:24.194 --> 00:23:26.488
There was never an “if”.

482
00:23:27.864 --> 00:23:29.156
If I didn’t bring food home

483
00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:30.617
You know what would happen?

484
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:33.370
My dad would beat me.

485
00:23:34.329 --> 00:23:36.122
If I didn’t make any money.

486
00:23:36.123 --> 00:23:37.624
you know what would happen?

487
00:23:38.542 --> 00:23:40.584
My dad would lock me in the room

488
00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:42.629
and hit me with the belt.

489
00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.881
You Am-boys have it so good here

490
00:23:45.882 --> 00:23:46.882
in America

491
00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:48.968
Well I believe I'm gonna be the next

492
00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:50.804
Middleweight Champion of the world uncle.

493
00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:54.306
Do you think you're really going to be

494
00:23:54.307 --> 00:23:55.392
a big boxer on the TV?

495
00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:57.601
Huh?

496
00:23:58.061 --> 00:23:59.562
How many Asian boxers are there

497
00:23:59.563 --> 00:24:00.563
on TV?

498
00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:04.943
And who the hell are you?

499
00:24:05.402 --> 00:24:07.529
You’re not even good!

500
00:24:11.324 --> 00:24:12.741
Only one in a million

501
00:24:12.742 --> 00:24:13.742
can get there.

502
00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:15.536
So tell me. Zeus

503
00:24:16.204 --> 00:24:17.789
Are you one in a million?

504
00:24:18.748 --> 00:24:20.625
Or just one in a dozen?

505
00:24:24.963 --> 00:24:26.130
Pray for your son that he

506
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.131
wakes up.

507
00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:31.470
Stop this dreaming now.

508
00:24:32.345 --> 00:24:33.889
Next time I see you

509
00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:35.639
I don’t want to hear about

510
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.725
this boxing.

511
00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:39.436
It’s time you help your mom.

512
00:24:39.978 --> 00:24:41.938
Time to be practical.

513
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.691
Give up this dream!

514
00:24:45.442 --> 00:24:46.776
Look at your mom’s face.

515
00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:49.612
That’s the look of hard work

516
00:24:49.613 --> 00:24:51.323
just to support you.

517
00:24:52.365 --> 00:24:54.075
It’s time you support her.

518
00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:15.638
Zeus!

519
00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:18.058
You get my next fight yet?

520
00:25:18.266 --> 00:25:18.808
No. no no

521
00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:19.976
I got you something better.

522
00:25:20.143 --> 00:25:21.019
Come on. man.

523
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.020
Look! I got you

524
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.020
something better.

525
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:24.980
Oh. damn.

526
00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:28.109
Just saw it.

527
00:25:28.235 --> 00:25:29.777
Everybody is wondering who it was.

528
00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:30.612
I knew it was you when you

529
00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:31.612
threw that right.

530
00:25:32.489 --> 00:25:33.323
You’re going to be fucking

531
00:25:33.323 --> 00:25:34.032
famous man.

532
00:25:34.033 --> 00:25:35.407
I know you’re trying to be off

533
00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:36.909
the grid. but right now is

534
00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:37.869
the perfect time to get

535
00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:38.869
back on it.

536
00:25:38.995 --> 00:25:40.247
You’re blowing up.

537
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:42.249
So does this mean you’ll

538
00:25:42.249 --> 00:25:43.249
get me my next fight?

539
00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:44.792
Yes!

540
00:25:45.001 --> 00:25:46.043
This means big bucks for

541
00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:47.837
you and for me.

542
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:49.589
Alright then.

543
00:25:49.589 --> 00:25:50.382
I just wanted to show you

544
00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:51.382
in person.

545
00:25:51.758 --> 00:25:52.676
You really knocked the shit

546
00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:53.301
out of that guy.

547
00:25:53.343 --> 00:25:54.678
Oh. my God!

548
00:25:55.762 --> 00:25:57.137
All you had to do next was give

549
00:25:57.138 --> 00:25:59.391
him a blanket. Night night bitch.

550
00:26:03.103 --> 00:26:04.728
Damn man! Good job!

551
00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:05.981
You really showed him.

552
00:26:06.189 --> 00:26:07.189
Appreciate it. brother.

553
00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:09.526
I told you. you was gonna be famous.

554
00:26:13.154 --> 00:26:14.698
That was a good punch. son.

555
00:26:15.031 --> 00:26:15.782
Thanks.

556
00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:17.450
I’m Coach Green. nice to meet you.

557
00:26:17.492 --> 00:26:18.492
Zeus.

558
00:26:19.536 --> 00:26:21.328
Hey. How would you like to make

559
00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:22.329
some cash?

560
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:23.373
I got this.

561
00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:24.666
I’m his manager.

562
00:26:24.666 --> 00:26:25.584
How you doing?

563
00:26:25.585 --> 00:26:27.042
Unofficial manager.

564
00:26:27.043 --> 00:26:28.169
What’s the deal?

565
00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:29.170
How about you test out them

566
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:30.171
knockout skills against my

567
00:26:30.172 --> 00:26:31.214
fighter over there?

568
00:26:34.509 --> 00:26:35.218
Alright.

569
00:26:35.219 --> 00:26:36.677
You knock him out. I’ll

570
00:26:36.678 --> 00:26:38.346
give you a thousand bucks cash.

571
00:26:40.473 --> 00:26:41.473
That’s all I gotta do?

572
00:26:41.474 --> 00:26:42.725
Yup. that’s all you gotta do.

573
00:26:42.726 --> 00:26:43.768
Just knock him out.

574
00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:45.102
What if I lose?

575
00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.062
Nothing.

576
00:26:46.063 --> 00:26:47.731
You got nothing to lose.

577
00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:49.773
Alright then.

578
00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:51.109
Where’s your trainer?

579
00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:52.402
I don’t have one.

580
00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:58.533
You got this.

581
00:27:14.174 --> 00:27:14.799
You sure you want to do

582
00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:15.799
this fight?

583
00:27:16.092 --> 00:27:17.302
Yeah. I need the money.

584
00:27:18.553 --> 00:27:19.553
Alright.

585
00:27:19.763 --> 00:27:21.014
Let's get started.

586
00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:25.184
Aye! Just so you know this is

587
00:27:25.185 --> 00:27:26.268

588
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:27.479
Not kung flu.

589
00:27:29.105 --> 00:27:30.356
Aye coach.

590
00:27:30.357 --> 00:27:32.025
You know there’s COVID going around.

591
00:27:32.525 --> 00:27:33.525
And you put me head to head

592
00:27:33.526 --> 00:27:34.526

593
00:27:34.778 --> 00:27:35.737
You trying to me taking out

594
00:27:35.738 --> 00:27:36.938
before the fight even started.

595
00:27:37.947 --> 00:27:39.281
Shut up. man. Let’s fight.

596
00:27:39.282 --> 00:27:41.325
Oh. shit. This nigga

00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:42.577

598
00:27:42.702 --> 00:27:44.912
Ok. You had me confused there

599
00:27:44.913 --> 00:27:46.247
Kung-flu master.

600
00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.208
I hope you know how American

601
00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:50.210

602
00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:52.544
You see. it all starts

603
00:27:52.545 --> 00:27:53.545
with a jab.

604
00:27:54.255 --> 00:27:56.049
Moving too fast for you. brother?

605
00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:02.930

00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:03.931
Too easy!

Come on. coach!

610
00:28:45.265 --> 00:28:46.349
See. I’m the best.

611
00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:47.558
I'm the next middleweight champion

612
00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:50.060
of the world. Aye. is there

613
00:28:50.061 --> 00:28:51.311

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.407
I accept Paypal or Venmo.

617
00:29:13.042 --> 00:29:14.669
Set up the fight.

618
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:17.796
You sure you want to fight

619
00:29:17.797 --> 00:29:18.548
this guy?

620
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:19.882
Damn. sure.

621
00:29:19.883 --> 00:29:20.924
This guy is going around.

622
00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:23.010
punching random Americans?

623
00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:23.845
Fuck that!

624
00:29:23.846 --> 00:29:25.053
I’m going to send his ass back

625
00:29:25.054 --> 00:29:26.054
to China.

626
00:29:26.639 --> 00:29:27.806
I’ve been doing my research.

627
00:29:27.807 --> 00:29:29.601
he’s from Los Angeles.

628
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:31.352
And he’s Filipino.

629
00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:33.061
Same shit.

630
00:29:33.062 --> 00:29:34.313
He fought some guy the ring

631
00:29:34.314 --> 00:29:36.315
he snuck up behind him

632
00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:37.691
and knocked him out.

633
00:29:37.692 --> 00:29:39.067
A true fighter. faces his

634
00:29:39.068 --> 00:29:40.779
opponent and then strikes.

635
00:29:41.154 --> 00:29:42.404
Look. I’m ready.

636
00:29:42.405 --> 00:29:42.906
I want you to fly out

637
00:29:42.907 --> 00:29:44.323
there tomorrow and setup

638
00:29:44.324 --> 00:29:45.324
the fight.

639
00:29:45.325 --> 00:29:47.118
Sounds like we’re going to war.

640
00:30:07.222 --> 00:30:09.223
Uh. can I help you. sir?

641
00:30:09.224 --> 00:30:10.141
Morning. ma’am.

642
00:30:10.142 --> 00:30:11.935
I’d like to talk to Zeus Ortega.

643
00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:16.189
Uh. is he in trouble?

644
00:30:16.564 --> 00:30:19.608
Because he doesn’t live here.

645
00:30:19.609 --> 00:30:21.777
He lives in uh Stockton with his

646
00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:22.654
Auntie Pat.

647
00:30:22.655 --> 00:30:24.988
No. ma’am. I’d like to present

648
00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:26.573
an offer to your son.

649
00:30:26.574 --> 00:30:29.326
For the Middleweight championship title

650
00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:30.327
of the world.

651
00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:46.511
You don’t mind if I…

652
00:30:49.305 --> 00:30:50.556
Uh. would you like some

653
00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:53.893
Buko Juice or calamansi juice?

654
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:02.443
Water would be nice ma’am thank you.

655
00:31:06.823 --> 00:31:08.366
You’re quite the talk of the town.

656
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.242
Thank you.

657
00:31:09.243 --> 00:31:11.828
You’re trending all over social media.

658
00:31:12.328 --> 00:31:13.704
I don’t know if you’re familiar with

659
00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:15.706
Rob Rodeo Cooper?

660
00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:17.332
I’m very familiar with Rob.

661
00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:18.584
I think he’s a great fighter.

662
00:31:18.585 --> 00:31:19.960
Well. he thinks you’re a

663
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:21.086
great fighter.

664
00:31:21.087 --> 00:31:23.423
Matter of fact. that’s why I’m here.

665
00:31:27.969 --> 00:31:29.386
How’d you like to go head to head

666
00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:30.387
with the champ?

667
00:31:32.015 --> 00:31:33.015
Wow.

668
00:31:33.349 --> 00:31:34.600
I don’t know what to say.

669
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:35.851
I'd be honored.

670
00:31:35.852 --> 00:31:37.936
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

671
00:31:37.937 --> 00:31:39.313
Uh. but how much money

672
00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:40.731
will my son get to fight this

673
00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:42.608
uh Rodeo?

674
00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:43.109
Well this would be a big

675
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.861
fight so you’ll be receiving about

676
00:31:45.862 --> 00:31:49.490
1.2 Million dollars.

677
00:31:49.782 --> 00:31:51.492
Oh. my God!

678
00:31:53.202 --> 00:31:55.121
A Million dollars?

679
00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:05.048
Anak. Zeus. say yes!

680
00:32:06.466 --> 00:32:08.425
Rodeo would be getting ten.

681
00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:09.885
Obviously because of his record.

682
00:32:09.886 --> 00:32:11.595
But you will walk away

683
00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:13.681
with a million win or lose.

684
00:32:18.394 --> 00:32:19.686
Hold on mom let me get

685
00:32:19.687 --> 00:32:21.021
the details for a second.

686
00:32:21.022 --> 00:32:22.981
I don’t care about the details.

687
00:32:22.982 --> 00:32:24.984
I don’t want to work anymore.

688
00:32:25.693 --> 00:32:27.486
Where’s the contract? I’ll sign.

689
00:32:27.487 --> 00:32:29.363
Hold on. What’s the catch?

690
00:32:29.364 --> 00:32:32.033
There’s no catch. Win or lose.

691
00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:34.077
The money is yours.

692
00:32:47.548 --> 00:32:49.592
Alright. let’s do it.

693
00:33:03.272 --> 00:33:05.482
–What the fuck just happened?
–Hold on. calm down for

694
00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:07.734
–a second.
–no. no. no. I look online

695
00:33:07.735 --> 00:33:10.321
–and your mom posted something
about you being a millionaire?

696
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.200
–I signed the deal.
–Signed what?

697
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:18.579
A 1.2 million dollar contract
to fight Rob "Rodeo" Cooper

698
00:33:19.247 --> 00:33:22.165
Why didn’t you call me?
I thought I was your manager.

699
00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:24.626
Man. it happened so fast.
What do you want me to say?

700
00:33:24.627 --> 00:33:25.627
No.

701
00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:28.464
And besides it’s not like
you’re getting me deals anyways.

702
00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:31.842
You’re always like. “Zeus. you
gonna be famous!”

703
00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:33.845
“Zeus. you gonna get this
and that!”

704
00:33:33.928 --> 00:33:36.597
Man. at the end of the day
I just want to fight.

705
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:39.391
And when you’re at home living
with your mom and all you hear

706
00:33:39.392 --> 00:33:42.310
is that you’re a loser.
And you won’t amount to nothing.

707
00:33:42.311 --> 00:33:45.564
Man. something inside just said
sign the damn thing.

708
00:33:45.565 --> 00:33:50.570
I get it. I understand.
But I have to ask you

709
00:33:51.404 --> 00:33:54.948
as your manager. the one who
always believed in you…

710
00:33:54.949 --> 00:33:57.952
–Aw. man here it is
–I mean always believed in you

711
00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:03.999
I gotta know. are you gracious
enough. generous enough. to give

712
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.001
me ten percent?

713
00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:10.923
First of all. you never get me
any fights.

714
00:34:11.799 --> 00:34:14.802
Second of all
you always all talk and no delivery.

715
00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:20.682
At the end of the day. loyalty is
more important than money.

716
00:34:20.683 --> 00:34:22.059
–Yup.
–So I’m gonna give you some

717
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.061
–money.
–Yeah?

718
00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:26.063
Alright. alright. aye!
Don’t make me knock your ass out.

719
00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:28.316
Hey. hey. hey!
Save that for the ring with Cooper.

720
00:34:28.983 --> 00:34:29.983
Alright.

721
00:34:30.985 --> 00:34:35.447
But let’s be serious.
What are you gonna do

722
00:34:35.448 --> 00:34:36.448
for a trainer?

723
00:34:37.617 --> 00:34:39.077
You’re not going to like
this answer.

724
00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.037
But I think I know the right guy.

725
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.873
It better not be Coach Green.

726
00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:46.291
No.

727
00:34:46.959 --> 00:34:48.002
No. no. no. no. no.

728
00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:51.005
–He’s crazy!
–And that’s why he’s perfect.

729
00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:57.095
You’re the one in the ring.
Not me.

730
00:34:57.386 --> 00:35:00.972
As long as you sign the check
for the ten percent. we’re good.

731
00:35:00.973 --> 00:35:02.100
I’m out of here.

732
00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:30.837
Back so soon?
I sent your ass the money.

733
00:35:31.212 --> 00:35:33.506
–I sent it back.
–Now why would you do that for?

734
00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:36.759
–Because I want you to be my coach.
–Your coach?

735
00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:40.387
Yeah. I don’t have one.
And I need one to beat Rob

736
00:35:40.388 --> 00:35:42.390
Rodeo Cooper.
–Hear this nigga?

737
00:35:43.683 --> 00:35:47.018
No offense man. But I train
real fighters. Mother fuckers

738
00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:49.729
that came from the streets.
Not no social media viral one

739
00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:52.732
hit wonder mother fuckers.
–I grew up in a tough area

740
00:35:52.733 --> 00:35:54.734
too. alright.
I got into my first fight when

741
00:35:54.735 --> 00:35:55.735
I was eleven.

742
00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:57.597
What else you did in kindergarten?

743
00:35:58.239 --> 00:35:59.990
Man. if you don’t want
to train me. that’s fine. I’ll

744
00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:01.033
find someone else.

745
00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:05.163
Hold on. Hold on.

746
00:36:06.539 --> 00:36:08.259
Now. i’m not saying i’m
gonna be your coach.

747
00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:10.417
But i’m gonna give your
monkey ass a chance to show

748
00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:11.752
me the fuck you got.

749
00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:13.504
Alright.

750
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:15.964
Now. get the fuck out my face
before I change my mother

751
00:36:15.965 --> 00:36:17.216
fucking mind.

752
00:37:13.022 --> 00:37:14.732
Aye. put it back!

753
00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:19.403
Aye. put that shit back!
Or I’ll knock your ass out!

754
00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:20.947
Here. just take it!

755
00:37:23.366 --> 00:37:26.202
Keep it! Just don’t mess with
her anymore.

756
00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:45.303
Thank you.
You didn’t have to do that.

757
00:37:45.304 --> 00:37:46.347
No problem.

758
00:37:48.015 --> 00:37:49.641
That guy always does that.

759
00:37:49.642 --> 00:37:50.642
What do you mean?

760
00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.855
He doesn’t take a lot. but
I see everytime he does it.

761
00:37:55.398 --> 00:37:57.649
I’m sure he needs it more
than I do.

762
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:59.192
So you let him steal from you?

763
00:37:59.193 --> 00:38:00.987
I don’t look at it as stealing.

764
00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:05.449
Well. I usually see you here
working hard and singing

765
00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:08.164
and you can’t let people
like that rob from you.

766
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:13.581
Well. what’s worse?
A robber or a stalker?

767
00:38:13.582 --> 00:38:16.751
Woah. woah. who’s a stalker?
Hold on. I’m trying to do a

768
00:38:16.752 --> 00:38:20.255
good thing here. Help
you out. I’m not some

769
00:38:20.256 --> 00:38:22.341
creepy guy that just stares
at you all day.

770
00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:24.343
Right.

771
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.346
–I’m Cora.
–Zeus.

772
00:38:28.347 --> 00:38:32.726
–That’s a cool name.
–It’s short for Corazon

773
00:38:32.727 --> 00:38:34.729
Corazon Punongbayan.

774
00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:38.273
–Oh. so you’re Filipino?
–My name always gives

775
00:38:38.274 --> 00:38:40.275
it away...
It means. Tree...

776
00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:42.278
“Tree of the People”.

777
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.071
Yeah. I'm Filipino too.

778
00:38:44.739 --> 00:38:47.116
–What’s your last name?
–Ortega.

779
00:38:48.075 --> 00:38:52.037
–Sounds more Mexican.
–Aren’t Filipino’s the Mexican’s of

780
00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:53.038
Asia.

781
00:38:54.123 --> 00:38:55.999
I think I heard Jo Koy say
that once.

782
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.209
Jo Koy’s hilarious!

783
00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:59.795
Yeah. he put Filipino’s on the map!

784
00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:03.590
Look. um I don’t know if
It’s your lunch break

785
00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:05.592
right now. but I do know
a good place around here

786
00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:08.471
that sells good halo halo.
If you want to try it.

787
00:39:09.889 --> 00:39:13.559
I mean I did save you
from being robbed so…

788
00:39:25.988 --> 00:39:28.823
I love how Villa Manilla makes
the best halo halo.

789
00:39:28.824 --> 00:39:32.035
It’s like finally. white folks
would be able to enjoy our food.

790
00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:37.999
I know. right. For the longest time
I was always embarrassed

791
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.919
to eat any Filipino food
in front of my white friends.

792
00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.757
Because they would always be like.
“What’s that smell?”

793
00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:50.595
I wish I can go to the
Philippines someday just for

794
00:39:50.596 --> 00:39:51.596
the food.

795
00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:52.431
Yea

796
00:39:52.432 --> 00:39:55.100
–Have you ever been?
–Yeah. when I was really young.

797
00:39:55.101 --> 00:39:58.645
But I haven’t been there ever since.
I always see photos on social of

798
00:39:58.646 --> 00:40:01.398
I always see photos on social of
Boracay. Palawan. i’m like

799
00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:04.025
That’s my hood!
It makes me proud to see

800
00:40:04.026 --> 00:40:06.195
Filipinos being recognized for
something.

801
00:40:06.278 --> 00:40:09.824
Yeah.
It’s either that or balut.

802
00:40:10.366 --> 00:40:12.868
Oh. that nasty egg fetus thing?

803
00:40:13.202 --> 00:40:17.705
–Wait! You don’t like it?
–Gross! You like that stuff?

804
00:40:17.706 --> 00:40:18.706
Yeah!

805
00:40:20.376 --> 00:40:22.711
How would you know
unless you try?

806
00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:25.255
How about this. if I find
a good balut place

807
00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:28.050
you gotta take me there?
–If you find a good one.

808
00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:30.428
I’m really picky when it
comes to good balut.

809
00:40:31.387 --> 00:40:32.888
And the way you gotta eat it

810
00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:42.606
I see you got them good
balut skills.

811
00:40:46.735 --> 00:40:50.613
So. are you training for
a marathon or something?

812
00:40:50.614 --> 00:40:53.075
No. I'm training for a
pretty big fight.

813
00:40:53.742 --> 00:40:57.204
Oh. you’re a fighter?
MMA or boxing?

814
00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:59.081
I box.

815
00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.000
Well. show me what you got.

816
00:41:03.919 --> 00:41:07.506
Oh. my God!
I am so sorry!

817
00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:10.384
–It’s fine.
–I thought you were fast!

818
00:41:10.509 --> 00:41:13.928
I am fast. I just you know
didn’t expect it. Um. but

819
00:41:13.929 --> 00:41:15.389
anyways uh. what do you do?

820
00:41:17.391 --> 00:41:20.143
Obviously. you didn’t hear me
singing back there.

821
00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:22.646
Oh. I have and you sing
really well.

822
00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:25.273
–Right.
–No really!

823
00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:26.358
You’re just saying that.

824
00:41:27.067 --> 00:41:29.777
No. I know I’m toward the
end of my run when I start

825
00:41:29.778 --> 00:41:32.280
to hear your voice.
There’s something unique about it

826
00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:37.036
where I don’t hear the ocean or
People. I just hear you singing.

827
00:41:41.749 --> 00:41:45.961
I moved here from San Francisco.
To become a singer.

828
00:41:46.378 --> 00:41:52.259
But I never caught my lucky break.
Been here for about five years now.

829
00:41:53.385 --> 00:41:59.433
No recording contract.
no deal. no luck.

830
00:41:59.934 --> 00:42:01.476
Well you know I don’t really
believe in luck.

831
00:42:01.477 --> 00:42:05.313
I feel like we’re all blessed with
unique gifts. And it’s up to us

832
00:42:05.314 --> 00:42:09.150
to use these gifts every single day.
Some people never really realize their

833
00:42:09.151 --> 00:42:11.903
gifts. You know? And they just
waste their lives trying to figure

834
00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:15.240
it out. But once you do.
I feel like you gotta fight

835
00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:17.201
for it.
Because life is a fight.

836
00:42:20.037 --> 00:42:21.205
Well...

837
00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:23.374
I better get going.

838
00:42:24.416 --> 00:42:26.584
Are you on social?
Not really because I’m trying

839
00:42:26.585 --> 00:42:29.212
to stay focused for this fight.
But how about you come over

840
00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:31.048
sometime?
And we can try some balut?

841
00:42:33.842 --> 00:42:34.842
Sure.

842
00:43:03.622 --> 00:43:05.342
Leave your shit in the car
and come with me.

843
00:43:20.889 --> 00:43:22.308
See this neighborhood out here?

844
00:43:23.517 --> 00:43:25.978
It’s where I first got jumped by
eight motherfuckers.

845
00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.690
I had to try and crawl out
here alive.

846
00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:32.860
See that block right here?

847
00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:38.698
That’s where I first got stabbed.
I was just minding my business.

848
00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:41.827
Then all of a sudden it was
blood everywhere.

849
00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:49.709
See that curve right there?
I took that same guy.

850
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:54.213
put his head on that curb
and kicked his motherfucking

851
00:43:54.214 --> 00:43:55.215
teeth in

852
00:43:57.384 --> 00:43:59.219
No one ever fucked with me
after that.

853
00:44:08.771 --> 00:44:11.315
–What up Coach Green?
–What up young blood?

854
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.233
How you doing?
See you got some fresh

855
00:44:14.234 --> 00:44:16.152
meat in the house.
Yeah. we about to put his

856
00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.654
ass on the grill. see what
he’s made of.

857
00:44:17.655 --> 00:44:19.448
Alright. Well. let’s see what
he can do.

858
00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:28.165
–Yo! Coach Green!
–Back from the dead.

859
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:31.210
–They out back?
–Yeah. they out back.

860
00:44:32.961 --> 00:44:35.838
Who’s this supposed to be man?
The next Pacquiao or some shit?

861
00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:38.425
Yeah. we’ll see. We’ll see.

862
00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:58.444
Ding. ding. ding. We got
some fresh new meat in

863
00:44:58.445 --> 00:45:00.030
the house.
–Yessir.

864
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.161
Yea. You got no where to
go now. kung flu.

865
00:45:08.205 --> 00:45:09.965
Now. you sure you want to
learn how to fight?

866
00:45:10.582 --> 00:45:11.582
Yeah.

867
00:45:12.084 --> 00:45:13.877
Be careful what you ask for.

868
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:17.214
This is where the real fighting
is done. In the streets.

869
00:45:17.715 --> 00:45:21.843
Not in no damn boxing gym.
These guys here. they do

870
00:45:21.844 --> 00:45:24.346
this for a living.
It’s not a sport to them.

871
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:28.307
It’s life and death.
They fight every motherfucking

872
00:45:28.308 --> 00:45:30.769
fucking day.
Some of these guys

873
00:45:31.812 --> 00:45:35.941
you may not even see them
tomorrow. This is survival for them.

874
00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:39.486
Be warned. They’re not going
to be easy on you.

875
00:45:40.154 --> 00:45:42.322
I’m just here to make sure
they don’t kill your ass.

876
00:45:46.326 --> 00:45:48.119
Are you sure you want
to learn how to fight?

877
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.206
–Yeah. I just need some gloves.
–This nigga said gloves.

878
00:45:51.957 --> 00:45:54.250
Gloves?
There ain’t no gloves in

879
00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:57.504
a street fight.
Oh. and another thing.

880
00:45:58.005 --> 00:46:00.798
There ain’t no clock either.
You both go at it till one

881
00:46:00.799 --> 00:46:02.551
is left standing.
–Huh?

882
00:46:11.685 --> 00:46:15.564
Lesson number one. always
keep your hands up.

883
00:46:20.486 --> 00:46:23.155
Feels different to get hit with
a bare punch. huh?

884
00:46:24.364 --> 00:46:26.408
Yeah. it’s a pain you’ll
never forget.

885
00:46:26.825 --> 00:46:28.951
We exercising your muscle memory
today.

886
00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:31.622
When I’m done. there won’t be no
muscle memory left.

887
00:46:41.799 --> 00:46:46.094
Lesson number two. remember
they always fight dirty.

888
00:46:46.678 --> 00:46:48.013
So be prepared.

889
00:47:01.902 --> 00:47:02.902
Trash

890
00:47:10.285 --> 00:47:11.828
–Jones.
–Yessir.

00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:12.829
You up next.

892
00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:51.201

898
00:48:11.805 --> 00:48:15.976
–Yes. mom.
–Oh. my God!

899
00:48:17.811 --> 00:48:21.105
–Look at your face!
–Mom. I'm fine.

900
00:48:21.106 --> 00:48:23.316
–Ugly again!

You have to fight smart.

You want that?

00:49:41.186 --> 00:49:42.979
Oh. you’re so pretty!

917
00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:45.607
Zeus! Come! It’s your girlfriend.

918
00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:50.778
I knew a Punongbayan.
Back in Pampanga.

919
00:49:50.779 --> 00:49:52.614
Very nice family.

920
00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:56.033
–Hey.
–What happened?

921
00:49:56.034 --> 00:49:58.285
Oh. sorry. I got beat up
in training.

922
00:49:58.286 --> 00:50:01.706
What kind of training is that?
My coach is crazy.

923
00:50:01.707 --> 00:50:05.084
–I’m so sorry I forgot about tonight.
–Oh. that’s ok.

924
00:50:05.085 --> 00:50:07.170
I brought you and your
mom a surprise.

925
00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:09.047
Thank you.

926
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:12.009
Balut!
Oh. I love balut!

927
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.760
Zeus. marry her!

928
00:50:14.761 --> 00:50:16.972
Please. come inside.

929
00:50:17.639 --> 00:50:19.099
Make yourself at home.

930
00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:32.988
Ok. I’m going to go upstairs
and watch my Filipino Channel.

931
00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:38.118
–It’s very nice to meet you.
–So nice to meet you too. auntie.

932
00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:45.916
–Sorry again about tonight.
–That’s ok.

933
00:50:45.917 --> 00:50:47.334
It’s cool I got to meet
your mom.

934
00:50:47.335 --> 00:50:50.421
This living at home thing
Is just a temporary thing.

935
00:50:50.422 --> 00:50:51.548
No need to explain.

936
00:50:52.799 --> 00:50:55.968
–It’s cute you’re a momma’s boy.
–I’m... I ain’t no momma’s boy.

937
00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:57.137
No. it’s fine.

938
00:50:57.637 --> 00:50:59.805
I think all Filipino guys are
momma’s boys.

939
00:50:59.806 --> 00:51:02.975
No. not all of them.
I’m not a momma’s boy.

940
00:51:02.976 --> 00:51:05.979
It means. it means you’ll treat
your future wife right.

941
00:51:11.777 --> 00:51:14.904
–Where’s your dad?
–Uh. he left when I was young.

942
00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:17.657
–I’m sorry to hear that.
–No. no need to be.

943
00:51:19.201 --> 00:51:20.826
So. are you ready?

944
00:51:20.827 --> 00:51:21.745
For what?

945
00:51:21.746 --> 00:51:24.997
For my favorite part of the night?

946
00:51:24.998 --> 00:51:26.583
What’s that?

947
00:51:27.834 --> 00:51:30.211
Eating balut!

948
00:51:30.212 --> 00:51:32.214
Yeah! I’m excited.

949
00:51:51.191 --> 00:51:53.401
Oh. no I can’t. I can’t.

950
00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:56.278
Come on. Zeus.
Yes. you can!

951
00:51:56.279 --> 00:52:00.950
Ah. man. I can’t.
Here. that balut thing is all you.

952
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:02.671
You said you would try it if I
brought some.

953
00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:06.997
See. you even have a
shell literally right here.

954
00:52:06.998 --> 00:52:07.499
You just got to remove it.

955
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:08.833
–Yeah.
–Do I?

956
00:52:08.834 --> 00:52:11.418
Yeah. you good now.
No. i’m good. I can’t.

957
00:52:11.419 --> 00:52:12.461
Come on!

958
00:52:12.462 --> 00:52:13.712
It looks so gross.

959
00:52:13.713 --> 00:52:17.926
You’re mister badass boxer
and you can’t eat an egg?

960
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.303
Come on!

961
00:52:23.682 --> 00:52:25.267
–Give me the damn egg!
–Yay!

962
00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:30.062
Aw. look at that. you can
even see the hair and...

963
00:52:30.063 --> 00:52:31.982
–Aw. man.
–Go ahead.

964
00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:36.111
Do I just open it or?

965
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:39.530
–Here you just…
–Alright.

966
00:52:39.531 --> 00:52:42.658
It’s like Jurassic Park.
Oh. it’s dripping.

967
00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:44.243
You gotta slurp the juice.

968
00:52:44.244 --> 00:52:46.246
Slurp the juice.

969
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:57.507
Alright. Good scoop.

970
00:53:04.723 --> 00:53:05.765
It’s pretty good.

971
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.893
See!

972
00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:12.229
Oh. I got a shell in there.
You hear that crunch?

973
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:15.275
Get it all! Yup!
Experience it all.

974
00:53:15.567 --> 00:53:17.444
It’s good. It’s good.
I like it.

975
00:53:18.737 --> 00:53:19.737
I told you.

976
00:53:20.238 --> 00:53:21.364
–You’re right.
–Right?

977
00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:24.826
Ok. What other animals you
got in there?

978
00:53:51.186 --> 00:53:53.605
–You back for more?
–What else you got?

979
00:53:56.524 --> 00:53:59.068
You gonna wish you never asked.
Put your shit in your car.

980
00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:00.069
And come with me.

981
00:54:07.827 --> 00:54:09.246
What are you again?

982
00:54:09.621 --> 00:54:10.621
What do you mean?

983
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:12.749
You Chinese? Japanese?

984
00:54:13.875 --> 00:54:15.543
I’m Filipino.

985
00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:17.337
Really? What’s your last name?

986
00:54:18.171 --> 00:54:19.422
Ortega.

987
00:54:20.632 --> 00:54:23.342
Shit. You gonna get along
with the cholos just fine.

988
00:54:23.343 --> 00:54:24.636
You practically Mexican.

989
00:54:25.345 --> 00:54:26.930
I was born out here in LA.

990
00:54:27.514 --> 00:54:30.725
Now how that make sense?
You look Chinese.

991
00:54:31.518 --> 00:54:34.562
your last name is Ortega.
but you were born in America?

992
00:54:35.146 --> 00:54:37.856
I guess America’s changing.
It’s not about the black or

993
00:54:37.857 --> 00:54:38.857
the white anymore.

994
00:54:39.484 --> 00:54:42.529
Maybe it is. But to Rodeo Cooper.

995
00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.532
You still Chinese.

996
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:04.301
Damn. look who it is.

997
00:55:05.635 --> 00:55:07.679
It ain’t about the black
or the white.

998
00:55:08.013 --> 00:55:10.597
It’s about the green.
What’s good. Coach Green?

999
00:55:10.598 --> 00:55:12.308
Aye. Paco my man. What’s going on?

1000
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:14.686
Same shit. different day.
You know what it is.

1001
00:55:16.604 --> 00:55:18.606
Is this the puto you want
us to stuff in the trunk?

1002
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:23.069
Relax. I’m fucking with you.
Chung Lee.

1003
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:26.823
He’s about to meet Sniper today.
–Oh. shit.

1004
00:55:29.117 --> 00:55:30.826
Want to know why
they call him Sniper?

1005
00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:31.619
Why?

1006
00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.998
Because when he shoots homes
he don’t miss.

1007
00:55:38.084 --> 00:55:42.005
Damn. Sniper. Fuck him up foo.
That’s what I’m talking about Ese.

1008
00:55:44.883 --> 00:55:47.676
What did I say?
Lesson number one.

1009
00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:50.638
Always keep your
hands up. Let’s go.

1010
00:55:53.224 --> 00:55:56.060
Damn. yo Chino’s got balls.
Chino. I would stay down

1011
00:55:56.061 --> 00:55:57.269
If I was you foo.

1012
00:55:57.270 --> 00:56:00.939
With him. when he throwing
his straight. You throw your

1013
00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:02.691
jab straight and hook.
Got it?

1014
00:56:02.692 --> 00:56:04.778
Yo. he wants some more.
Show him what’s up!

1015
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.406
Sniper. Let’s go. Sniper!

1016
00:56:13.119 --> 00:56:14.829
Oh! Damn. Chino!

1017
00:56:24.172 --> 00:56:26.216
Come on. Coach Green!

1018
00:56:31.763 --> 00:56:34.431
Listen to me. man.
I’m not going to be training you

1019
00:56:34.432 --> 00:56:35.933
If you keep getting your ass beat.

1020
00:56:35.934 --> 00:56:38.560
I need for you to get close enough
to him so you can land

1021
00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:39.561
your punches.

1022
00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:42.690
Then jab. straight and hook.
Let’s go!

1023
00:56:56.913 --> 00:56:58.456
Boom! There it is.

1024
00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:01.917
–Shit. you good Snipe?
–That’s what I’m talking about.

1025
00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:05.462
You get hit a hundred times.
But with a one hitter quitter.

1026
00:57:05.463 --> 00:57:07.464
It's over.

1027
00:57:07.465 --> 00:57:08.216
Send in the next guy.

1028
00:57:08.217 --> 00:57:10.468
Yo. Max! Fuck this puto up.

1029
00:57:12.178 --> 00:57:13.971
The bigger they are.
the harder they fall.

1030
00:57:13.972 --> 00:57:16.557
With him. straight body shots.
You’re going to have to go

00:57:16.558 --> 00:57:18.101

Go downstairs on him

Straight body shots.

00:58:06.065 --> 00:58:09.152
Get up. man.
Get yo ass up. let’s go.

1044
00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:24.166
Consider this your lesson
for the day Jackie Chan.

1045
00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:26.252
Don’t fuck with the streets.

1046
00:58:26.628 --> 00:58:29.171
You can do that boxing shit
all the fuck you want up in the

1047
00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:33.550
gym. But when you step
to us. vato. You best make

1048
00:58:33.551 --> 00:58:35.094
sure you come prepared.

1049
00:58:36.137 --> 00:58:39.223
You lucky you rolling with Coach G.
Otherwise you wouldn’t be

1050
00:58:39.224 --> 00:58:41.351
rolling out of here alive Chino.

1051
00:59:03.957 --> 00:59:05.477
Slow it down. Slow it down. Slow down.

1052
00:59:14.092 --> 00:59:15.718
You're fighting for America.

1053
00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:20.847
Up. up. up

1054
00:59:20.848 --> 00:59:25.227
One. One. One.
Two. One. Two. Five. Six.

1055
00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:27.229
One. Two. Five. Six.

1056
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:29.732
Move. Move. Move.
Move. Move. Move.

1057
00:59:34.362 --> 00:59:36.281
You’re fighting for your country.

1058
00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:41.660
One. Two. Three. Four.
Good. One. Two. Three. Four.

1059
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:43.329
One. Two. Three. Four.

1060
00:59:48.042 --> 00:59:53.880
Again. Again. Again.

1061
00:59:53.881 --> 00:59:58.052
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

1062
01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:03.516
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1063
01:00:09.063 --> 01:00:13.150
Come on. Get up boy. Get up boy.
Let’s go again.

1064
01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:15.570
Come on. Let’s go.

1065
01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:27.957
You’re fighting for your momma.

1066
01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.881
Give me a right hand. Take a rest.

1067
01:00:47.393 --> 01:00:48.393
Hey!

1068
01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:50.729
Yo!

1069
01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:53.441
Wake up.

1070
01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:55.026
Training’s over man.

1071
01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:58.905
–What do you mean?
–You don’t got what it takes. man.

1072
01:00:59.364 --> 01:01:02.741
I don’t train losers in the gym.
I train fighters and you’re

1073
01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.242
not a fighter.
–What are you talking about?

1074
01:01:04.243 --> 01:01:06.244
I fought all those people
you were telling me to.

1075
01:01:06.245 --> 01:01:08.206
Oh. you got your ass beat.
That’s what happened.

1076
01:01:08.289 --> 01:01:09.915
I was listening to what
you told me to.

1077
01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:11.750
Listening and doing is two different
things.

1078
01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:13.460
You just like those other boxers
out there.

1079
01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:16.464
They watch a boxer on TV
and they want to be on TV.

1080
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:19.300
But I put your ass in the street
And you can’t fight for shit.

1081
01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:22.260
They see people on social media
training and posting and talkin

1082
01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:26.766
about they putting in work. But in
reality they all fluff.

1083
01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:30.812
No core. They all for show.

1084
01:01:31.562 --> 01:01:33.480
They soft. just like all those
other millennials.

1085
01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:35.524
Well. I’m different and I fight different.

1086
01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.526
How you different?
What is different about you?

1087
01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.403
Huh? Are you saying you’re a
Gorilla in Manilla?

1088
01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:42.155
Cause you can’t fight for shit.
You’re just all for show.

1089
01:01:42.156 --> 01:01:45.575
And you’re not even a real trainer.
Taking people out into the streets.

1090
01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:48.328
Teaching them how to fight.
That’s not how the greats did it.

1091
01:01:48.329 --> 01:01:50.789
That’s not how Ali did it.
–Is you Ali. huh? Is you

1092
01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.290
Fucking Ali?
–I’m Zeus!

1093
01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:54.292
Who the fuck is Zeus? Huh?
Your mother should have named you

1094
01:01:54.293 --> 01:01:56.295
Goose or Loose cause you
can’t fight for shit.

1095
01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:58.756
Man. I’m out of here.

1096
01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:02.551
Only true fighters train with me.
Motherfuckers from the streets.

1097
01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:05.595
I’m a true fighter. When you told me
to fight those gangs. I was down.

1098
01:02:05.596 --> 01:02:07.723
I’m even down to fight you
right now in the ring.

1099
01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.641
–You sure you want to do that?
–Yeah.

1100
01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:11.394
Ok. Let’s get started.

1101
01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:28.828
Ok.

1102
01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:36.836
You ain’t no Gorilla in Manilla.

1103
01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.967
How the fuck you gonna take on
Rodeo Cooper? You can’t even

1104
01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:46.249
hit an old man. What the fuck
is the matter with you. boy?

1105
01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:57.564
Look at you. you can’t fight
for shit. Get your monkey

1106
01:02:57.565 --> 01:02:58.565
ass up.

1107
01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:10.495
You could get hit a hundred times.
But with a one-hitter-quitter. it’s over

1108
01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:31.933
Anak? Are you ok?

1109
01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:36.603
Anak! What did I say?

1110
01:03:36.604 --> 01:03:39.272
Stop getting hit. Look at your face.

1111
01:03:39.273 --> 01:03:42.777
–Mom. it’s boxing.
–Stop getting boxed

1112
01:03:43.277 --> 01:03:45.029
You box them.

1113
01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:48.240
–I’m going to go to bed.
–Oh. wait.

1114
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:52.787
Let me fix your face.
I’ll get my things.

1115
01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:08.636
Anak

1116
01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:12.639
You don’t have to keep
fighting If you don’t want to.

1117
01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:19.354
I want to mom. I have to.
You don’t have to do anything.

1118
01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:25.069
You don’t have to prove anything.
–Yes. I do. mom. People say I’m a loser.

1119
01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:30.532
You’re not a loser.
You cousin bong bong always in the

1120
01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:34.745
Casino. He’s a loser.
–I just want to make you proud.

1121
01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:38.416
I’m already proud of you. anak.

1122
01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:43.713
But you always tell me to be a nurse
or work at the post office.

1123
01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:51.553
I just care about you.
I want you to have enough money.

1124
01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:57.643
Because without money. we can’t
move in this world.

1125
01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:10.523
I grew up poor. With nothing.
It was so hard.

1126
01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:15.494
I don’t want you to go
through what I went through.

1127
01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:20.707
And that’s why I fight.
I want to buy us a big house someday.

1128
01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:23.586
And take care of us the
way dad didn’t.

1129
01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:29.091
He left and now I’m the
man of the house.

1130
01:05:30.134 --> 01:05:37.725
You have. anak a million dollars.
you’re a millionaire.

1131
01:05:38.559 --> 01:05:41.771
Not yet. mom. I still have to fight.
I have to win.

1132
01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:50.404
Uh. you don’t have to win.
You show up. let him beat you

1133
01:05:51.238 --> 01:05:54.491
and come home.
–I have to fight and I have to win.

1134
01:05:54.492 --> 01:05:56.952
For all of us Filipino Americans.

1135
01:05:56.953 --> 01:06:00.413
For minorities across the world.
That don’t have a voice.

1136
01:06:00.414 --> 01:06:02.667
What will you accomplish?

1137
01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:08.923
What will you promote?
More violence?

1138
01:06:09.256 --> 01:06:12.093
I’ll promote that anything is
possible in America.

1139
01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:15.720
And that a man can be born
from a poor woman in the Philippines

1140
01:06:15.721 --> 01:06:18.140
and become a boxing World Champion.

1141
01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:25.940
I’m proud of you. anak.
Win or lose.

1142
01:06:27.858 --> 01:06:31.027
You do what’s in your heart.
But remember

1143
01:06:31.028 --> 01:06:36.659
Always pray to God. So he’s
with you in the ring. Always.

1144
01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.203
Thanks. mom.

1145
01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:47.495
Now. you get some rest so you’re
ready to fight again tomorrow.

1146
01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:10.692
Hey!

1147
01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:12.737
Yo!

1148
01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.406
Hey!

1149
01:07:16.657 --> 01:07:17.783
Wake the fuck up!

1150
01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:21.161
Coach Green? How’d you get
in my house?

1151
01:07:21.162 --> 01:07:24.497
–Your momma let me in.
–It’s so early I keep hearing knocking

1152
01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:26.708
then this big guy scare me.

1153
01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:30.296
He said he’s your coach.
I said. “Ok.”

1154
01:07:31.797 --> 01:07:36.260
I didn’t know you still live
with your mom. Momma’s boy.

1155
01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:40.388
Get your monkey ass up.
–Aren’t all gangsters sleeping?

1156
01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:44.100
It’s like 3AM.
–Gangsters sleep with one eye open.

1157
01:07:44.101 --> 01:07:47.979
And so do fighters.
–You say. what’s all this gangster

1158
01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:50.648
gangster? Are you gangster?

1159
01:07:50.649 --> 01:07:54.528
No ma’am. I’m not a gangster.
I’m a cold-blooded killer.

1160
01:07:55.946 --> 01:07:58.115
And your son’s about to be
one too.

1161
01:11:07.054 --> 01:11:12.059
You got one more stop.
Long Beach.

1162
01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:22.361
–Coach Green!
–Uncle Yao!

1163
01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:42.006
Ladies. fellas.
Rule number four.

1164
01:11:42.423 --> 01:11:43.631
What is it?

1165
01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:44.632
No sex.

1166
01:11:44.883 --> 01:11:45.883
What?

1167
01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:48.053
No sex before a fight.

1168
01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:50.514
No masturbation. no porn no nothing.

1169
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:52.890
That makes no sense.

1170
01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:56.270
We need as much testosterone inside
of you as possible. Got it?

1171
01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:57.271
Got it.

1172
01:11:57.272 --> 01:11:58.731
I’m serious!

1173
01:11:58.897 --> 01:11:59.897
Got it.

1174
01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:08.532
Let me take you to the warehouse.

1175
01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:05.339
Now. this your kind.

1176
01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:07.716
You better take all that shit

1177
01:13:07.758 --> 01:13:09.093
that you learn and apply it now.

1178
01:13:10.302 --> 01:13:11.302
Tom here

1179
01:13:12.012 --> 01:13:13.931
he’s been fighting his whole damn life.

1180
01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:16.099
One of the baddest motherfuckers

1181
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.100
in the hood.

1182
01:13:17.684 --> 01:13:21.522
A Muay Thai fighter. And today

1183
01:13:22.981 --> 01:13:24.690
I’m allowing him to
kick your ass.

1184
01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:25.818
What?

1185
01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:30.113
You can’t kick in boxing.
–Oh. yes the hell you can.

1186
01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:31.949
This is a street fight. remember?

1187
01:13:33.617 --> 01:13:35.327
Adapt or die. gorilla! Adapt or die.

1188
01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:39.456
Footwork! Come on let me
see some footwork.

1189
01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:45.379
Hands up! Hands up!

1190
01:13:51.718 --> 01:13:55.764
Remember why you started.
Remember what you’re fighting for.

1191
01:13:57.349 --> 01:14:02.563
You want to know why gorillas pound
their chest? Cause they ready for combat.

1192
01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:05.190
And you ain’t ready for no damn
Combat.

1193
01:14:35.512 --> 01:14:37.514
Let’s go!

1194
01:14:57.284 --> 01:14:58.284
Let’s go!

1195
01:15:22.392 --> 01:15:23.977
My man.

1196
01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:27.832
You crazy. you know?
Coach Green believe in you.

1197
01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:29.251
He said you have heart.

1198
01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:35.882
I say he crazy. I say you crazy.

1199
01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:39.136
Perfect combination to win.

1200
01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:49.645
You got heart. kid.
You go down fighting and you

1201
01:16:49.646 --> 01:16:50.689
keep getting your ass up.

1202
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.942
And that’s what it takes to be
a champion in my book.

1203
01:16:55.819 --> 01:16:58.363
Let’s get your ass up so we
can get you ready for this fight.

1204
01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:43.676
Two. Two. One. One. One. Three.
Three. Three

1205
01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:45.011
Find that spot.

1206
01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:47.639
Start speeding it up.

1207
01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:53.979
There you go! There you go!

1208
01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.446
There you go! There you go!

1209
01:19:05.115 --> 01:19:06.532
–Zeus!
–What?

1210
01:19:06.533 --> 01:19:07.533
Come here. man.

1211
01:19:08.118 --> 01:19:09.493
Who designed the shirts?

1212
01:19:09.494 --> 01:19:09.995
Me!

1213
01:19:10.495 --> 01:19:12.831
Manila has one “L” not two.

1214
01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:14.832
Fuck!

1215
01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:17.335
Come on. man! You gotta
let me design the shirts next time.

1216
01:19:18.044 --> 01:19:19.962
Must have gotten this
shit from the flea market.

1217
01:19:19.963 --> 01:19:23.175
One. Two. Check this out. Zeus.

1218
01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:26.303
You ain’t doing this for you
no more.

1219
01:19:26.678 --> 01:19:28.221
You doing this for us now.

1220
01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:31.016
You a gorilla now.

1221
01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:39.648
Let's go. let's go!

1222
01:19:39.649 --> 01:19:40.984
Come on. push it! Push it!

1223
01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:07.968
Ladies and gentlemen. you can feel
the electricity in the air.

1224
01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:10.846
This is the fight we’ve all been
talking about.

1225
01:20:10.847 --> 01:20:14.934
Rob Rodeo Cooper versus some
unknown fighter. named Zeus.

1226
01:20:14.935 --> 01:20:17.394
“Gorilla in Manila” Ortega.

1227
01:20:17.395 --> 01:20:20.065
They’re making the announcement at
the press conference now.

1228
01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:24.777
After searching through thousands of
potential opponents for Rob Rodeo Cooper.

1229
01:20:24.778 --> 01:20:28.489
We are proud to announce that
we have selected Zeus.

1230
01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:32.911
“Gorilla in Manila” Ortega.
To fight on October 10th. 2020.

1231
01:20:33.995 --> 01:20:39.542
We spoke to so many potential
strong fighters we felt that going with

1232
01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:42.878
Zeus Ortega was the best option.
I’m going to hand over the mic over to

1233
01:20:42.879 --> 01:20:45.423
Rob. He’s going to share his thoughts
on the match.

1234
01:20:48.218 --> 01:20:54.432
When I saw a video online of Zeus
Punching an innocent American.

1235
01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:59.728
And I just saw this man collapse
I knew this type of behavior would have

1236
01:20:59.729 --> 01:21:04.441
to be handled the right way.
I stand today not as a boxer.

1237
01:21:04.442 --> 01:21:09.363
But as a person fighting for justice.
Today. I fight on behalf of the

1238
01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:12.324
American people.
On injustice and bullying.

1239
01:21:12.325 --> 01:21:16.829
And I'm going to make an example.
Out of Zeus Ortega on October 10th.

1240
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:19.082
Hold on. hold on.
I got to interrupt.

1241
01:21:19.332 --> 01:21:21.125
I got nothing but respect for
you. Rob.

1242
01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:23.669
And I greatly appreciate you
giving me this opportunity.

1243
01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:27.131
But let’s set the record straight.
That guy attacked me first.

1244
01:21:27.132 --> 01:21:29.049
And I was just trying to defend
an old man.

1245
01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:31.802
Yeah. but you’re a trained fighter.
How about you pick on somebody

1246
01:21:31.803 --> 01:21:32.721
your own size?

1247
01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:35.556
Not some innocent bystander
who was standing up for what he

1248
01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:40.394
believed in. I know your kind.
–See. this is the problem in America.

1249
01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:44.899
People like you. misinterpreting
The facts and spinning it around to

1250
01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:48.527
make me look like the bad guy.
After hearing what you just said

1251
01:21:48.528 --> 01:21:51.907
I got no problem knocking your ass
out on October 10th.

1252
01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.368
What country are you fighting for?
–Both of my parents are from the

1253
01:21:56.369 --> 01:22:00.372
Philippines but I was born right here
in L.A. and i’ll be fighting for

1254
01:22:00.373 --> 01:22:02.750
America.
–You’re not American. I’m American.

1255
01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:05.419
American’s don’t fuck
with weaker people just cause

1256
01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:09.214
they can. American’s don’t take injustice.
Why don’t you fight for your own

1257
01:22:09.215 --> 01:22:11.216
Country. wherever the fuck you came
from.

1258
01:22:11.217 --> 01:22:15.095
How confident are you in Zeus
defeating Rob Rodeo Cooper.

1259
01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:18.350
I’m very confident in Zeus will
kick Rodeo Cooper’s ass.

1260
01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:21.436
In fact I got a proposition to make.

1261
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:25.732
If Zeus loses to Rodeo Cooper
he’ll leave this country.

1262
01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:34.074
But if you lose. you leave America
for good.

1263
01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:35.616
Done.

1264
01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:42.289
–What are you doing?
–Relax. Mind games.

1265
01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.124
He fuck with you. you fuck
with him back.

1266
01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:47.087
You losing the mind.
You lose in the ring.

1267
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:50.757
Ok. It’s settled then.

1268
01:23:09.734 --> 01:23:11.944
Hey. coach! What the fuck was
that about?

1269
01:23:11.945 --> 01:23:16.907
–Mind games.
–What if I lose?

1270
01:23:16.908 --> 01:23:19.076
–Then you leaving America.
–What the fuck? I don’t want to

1271
01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:20.077
leave America.

1272
01:23:21.746 --> 01:23:22.872
Well. then win.

1273
01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:30.629
What the fuck were you thinking?
Why’d you say yes?

1274
01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:33.215
What are you talking about?
I’m gonna knock his ass out.

1275
01:23:33.216 --> 01:23:35.592
–What if you lose?
–I won’t.

1276
01:23:35.593 --> 01:23:38.555
–What if you do?
–I won’t.

1277
01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:39.115
Everything ok?

1278
01:24:47.123 --> 01:24:50.959
I don’t know if I could take out
Rodeo. And deep down inside

1279
01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:52.629
I don’t even know if I should fight.

1280
01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:56.882
What do you mean?

1281
01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:01.595
I see you out here and you play
and people walk past you.

1282
01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:05.766
With me. people think I’m some
Asian racist that just beats up

1283
01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:09.687
people. They look at me like
I’m some loser.

1284
01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:13.607
Well. maybe I am a loser.
And maybe this whole Rodeo

1285
01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:15.025
thing is just a payday.

1286
01:25:15.026 --> 01:25:18.655
A loser? Stop talking like that.

1287
01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:21.115
That’s how I feel.

1288
01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:22.659
And that’s why you fight.

1289
01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:28.373
You make sure the world knows
you. It’s why I’m out here everyday.

1290
01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:34.711
every night. I don’t care about
the money. I don’t care if people

1291
01:25:34.712 --> 01:25:39.091
walk past me. I don’t care if people
steal from me.

1292
01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:43.887
All I care about is that one
person who feels my music.

1293
01:25:43.888 --> 01:25:46.266
Who appreciates what I’m putting
out in the world.

1294
01:25:47.767 --> 01:25:50.269
I’m not like you Cora. I’m not making
music.

1295
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:52.397
You’re making history.

1296
01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:54.857
You’re fighting for us.

1297
01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:57.609
For Filipinos. For Americans.

1298
01:25:57.610 --> 01:26:01.280
I’m not American. People don’t even
know what I am. Is he Chinese?

1299
01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:02.823
Is he Vietnamese?
–And that’s why

1300
01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:07.578
you fight! You make sure they
know who you are.

1301
01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:10.539
I’m a nobody alright!
Nobody gives a fuck about me.

1302
01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:15.128
I’m a loser. A stupid fucking
Asian loser!

1303
01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:24.137
If that’s what you believe.
then you’re right.

1304
01:26:24.721 --> 01:26:26.055
Hands up!

1305
01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:29.976
Come on! Hands up!

1306
01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:32.854
Come on! Hands up!

1307
01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:35.857
Come on! Hands up!

1308
01:26:37.233 --> 01:26:40.486
Life’s a fight and you’re a fighter.

1309
01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:43.156
So show me you’re a fighter.

1310
01:27:17.607 --> 01:27:18.191
Coach.

1311
01:27:18.192 --> 01:27:22.111
What are you smiling for?
You look like you had some.

1312
01:27:25.531 --> 01:27:29.409
Oh. hell no. You did not.
Please tell me you didn’t

1313
01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:30.410
sleep with her.

1314
01:27:32.705 --> 01:27:34.332
Did you sleep with her?

1315
01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:36.959
Zeus. did you?

1316
01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:37.543
Yup!

1317
01:27:37.544 --> 01:27:39.337
You dumb motherfucker.

1318
01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:42.507
What the fuck did I say.
when I said. no sex?

1319
01:27:44.133 --> 01:27:46.386
Are you really trying to get knocked
out in the ring?

1320
01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:49.554
No

1321
01:27:49.555 --> 01:27:51.306
We need as much
testosterone inside you

1322
01:27:51.307 --> 01:27:54.435
As possible. and here you go
blowing up it inside her.

1323
01:27:55.186 --> 01:27:57.229
If you get your ass knocked out
I’m gonna say it’s because of that

1324
01:27:57.230 --> 01:27:58.230
pussy.

1325
01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:01.150
Am I interrupting?

1326
01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:03.653
–Nope.
–Did you guys have sex?

1327
01:28:06.489 --> 01:28:07.489
How was he?

1328
01:28:08.074 --> 01:28:08.741
What?

1329
01:28:08.742 --> 01:28:10.075
How was he in bed?

1330
01:28:10.076 --> 01:28:13.245
Uh. aggressive?

1331
01:28:13.246 --> 01:28:16.248
See. that’s the shit we need
in the ring. And here you go

1332
01:28:16.249 --> 01:28:19.293
blowing up inside her.
No offense. listen Miss Corazon

1333
01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:23.130
Do me a favor please. for the
love of God. Do not have sex

1334
01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:25.466
Only after the fight.
Got it?

1335
01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:29.554

–All right let’s take a break.
–I got my eye on you two.

1412
01:34:12.063 --> 01:34:14.648
–Hey –I’m so proud of you.

1413
01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:17.234
–You got this.
–Thanks.

1414
01:34:18.402 --> 01:34:19.695
You know. don’t jinx it now.

1415
01:34:20.696 --> 01:34:22.864
–I just wanted to see you.
–I want to see you too.

1416
01:34:22.865 --> 01:34:25.325
Except Coach Green’s been
killing me there in the ring.

1417
01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:29.330
Well. I got you a little gift
to help you with your training.

1418
01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:33.083
–What is it?
–It’s balut.

1419
01:34:33.084 --> 01:34:34.324
–Thank you.
–I’ll leave it here.

1420
01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:39.674
And I got you a gift too.
Here. come with me.

1421
01:34:45.471 --> 01:34:48.640
When I saw you singing at the
pier one night. I got this idea.

1422
01:34:48.641 --> 01:34:53.186
And I was like what if you
could sing in front of everyone on

1423
01:34:53.187 --> 01:34:57.440
TV? And so I contacted.
the commission and I asked them

1424
01:34:57.441 --> 01:34:59.442
if you could sing. the
Philippine National Anthem.

1425
01:34:59.443 --> 01:35:04.114
On fight night. and they said.
Yes!

1426
01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:11.037
This is so amazing!
You’re amazing.

1427
01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:13.039
You deserve it.

1428
01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.043
Wow. this is a blessing.

1429
01:35:21.924 --> 01:35:23.718
What the fuck is this shit?

1430
01:36:08.971 --> 01:36:12.599
Ladies and gentlemen. finally
the fight we’ve all been waiting for.

1431
01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:18.104
Rob “Rodeo” Cooper versus
Zeus “Gorilla in Manila” Ortega.

1432
01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:21.274
Yes. it’s finally here and these
times are truly crazy. Joe.

1433
01:36:21.275 --> 01:36:26.154
I mean this is the first time. in history
where the audience is all on TV.

1434
01:36:26.155 --> 01:36:29.282
I mean there’s really no audience
in this arena and it’s really weird.

1435
01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:31.993
But one thing’s for certain.
Covid will not stop these two

1436
01:36:31.994 --> 01:36:34.370
fighters tonight.
–I know. Chuck. hey. COVID has

1437
01:36:34.371 --> 01:36:37.540
taken a lot of things in this
world. but one thing it hasn’t taken

1438
01:36:37.541 --> 01:36:41.836
over is the sport of boxing.
Fighters will fight no matter what.

1439
01:36:41.837 --> 01:36:45.089
Hey. it could be Armageddon and
these two Still get in the ring with

1440
01:36:45.090 --> 01:36:49.302
each other. Especially with
the animosity Rodeo has towards

1441
01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:53.473
Zeus. Now. check this Coach
Green did say that if Zeus

1442
01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:55.767
Loses this fight. that he’ll
Move out of the country.

1443
01:36:55.768 --> 01:36:57.852
–Can you believe that?
–Oh. my gosh. Oh. this fight’s

1444
01:36:57.853 --> 01:37:00.313
going to be truly interesting.
I mean these times are

1445
01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:03.358
crazy. but you know who’s
even crazier? Is Rodeo Cooper.

1446
01:37:03.359 --> 01:37:08.029
I mean giving Ortega a chance
at the Middleweight title of the world

1447
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:12.116
All while his mother just passed away
not too long ago.

1448
01:37:12.117 --> 01:37:16.079
I mean this fight means a lot to him.
–Yeah. but Zeus is an underdog too

1449
01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:19.415
now. He was born in America.
Born in Los Angeles.

1450
01:37:19.416 --> 01:37:22.544
That’s my son. That’s my son.

1451
01:37:22.545 --> 01:37:26.548
And he went viral. Let’s not forget
he went viral.

1452
01:37:26.549 --> 01:37:28.342
Yo! Remember
when I knocked that chino out?

1453
01:37:31.804 --> 01:37:34.556
Aye! There's my man. Let’s go!

1454
01:37:34.557 --> 01:37:38.518
Man. I knocked this guy out already.
–Man. you stepped on his shoe.

1455
01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:41.187
Yeah. alright.
Nah. you did.

1456
01:37:41.188 --> 01:37:45.984
We got a professional fighter and
some kid who was viral on YouTube.

1457
01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:49.612
Absolutely no shot. I mean it
has to be a respect for the game.

1458
01:37:49.613 --> 01:37:53.324
You can’t just go viral
after one hit and get an opportunity

1459
01:37:53.325 --> 01:37:55.368
like this.
–You know my brother knocked me

1460
01:37:55.369 --> 01:37:58.288
out after one hit when I was eight
years old. Should he be in this ring

1461
01:37:58.289 --> 01:38:00.623
right now?
–My momma knocked me out

1462
01:38:00.624 --> 01:38:03.918
because I wouldn’t clean the dishes.
Could I step to my dad after that?

1463
01:38:03.919 --> 01:38:06.754
Tell you what. your mom.
my brother toe-to-toe right

1464
01:38:06.755 --> 01:38:08.756
after this. How about that?
–Let’s do it. You know what. let’s go.

1465
01:38:08.757 --> 01:38:10.134
Might as well.

1466
01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:15.013
–Oh. Zeus is so cute.
–What’d you say?

1467
01:38:15.014 --> 01:38:19.934
–What! He’s cute.
–I don’t know. My money’s on Cooper.

1468
01:38:19.935 --> 01:38:22.145
Man. fuck you. Who’s side
are you on?

1469
01:38:22.146 --> 01:38:23.898
I twenty thousand on Zeus.

1470
01:38:27.943 --> 01:38:29.945
I knocked his ass out.
he ain’t that hard.

1471
01:38:30.779 --> 01:38:32.488
That’s because you used
your legs.

1472
01:38:32.489 --> 01:38:34.115
Try using your hands next time.

1473
01:38:34.116 --> 01:38:36.576
I’ll use my hands on
him alright.

1474
01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:43.333
And we take it to the
ring with Miss Corazon Punong-bayan

1475
01:38:43.334 --> 01:38:46.628

1480
01:39:27.211 --> 01:39:28.586

different color.

1481
01:39:28.587 --> 01:39:33.258
You’re just jealous.
Because you can’t even fit in that.

1484
01:39:44.103 --> 01:39:46.312
–Hell no.

1485
01:39:46.313 --> 01:39:48.398
–Yeah. right.

Goddamn grandmother. She’s twenty
years fucking dead.

1538
01:45:40.542 --> 01:45:44.253
Listen. what you need to

and let it rip. Let them strong punches
get in there. man. Come on. champ.

01:45:57.976 --> 01:45:59.644
Now. stop playing games.

1544
01:46:00.562 --> 01:46:02.480
Back when I was in the ring.
I couldn’t even take that much.

1545
01:46:02.481 --> 01:46:04.775
Well. back in my day. I could.

Come on!

1550
01:46:32.928 --> 01:46:34.929
Oh. I believe that was a shoulder
in his face.

1551
01:46:34.930 --> 01:46:36.014
Oh. what a cheap shot.

1552
01:46:36.681 --> 01:46:37.974
Keep it clean.

1553
01:46:44.356 --> 01:46:46.690
Come on fight back! Fight back!

1554
01:46:46.691 --> 01:46:48.693
Side to side. Move your head!
Move your head!

1555
01:47:27.441 --> 01:47:29.316
I’m telling you. I need to get
in there to show these guys something.

1556
01:47:29.317 --> 01:47:31.862
You’re way out of your league.

1557
01:47:34.739 --> 01:47:40.202
Breathe. champ. breathe. Come on.
That’s nothing. That’s nothing. man.

1558
01:47:40.203 --> 01:47:42.997
Just breathe. Breathe. Alright.
Keep your hands up.

1559
01:47:42.998 --> 01:47:45.666
Keep your hands up.
His hands are high.

1560
01:47:45.667 --> 01:47:48.461
When he put his hands high
You got him in the ribs. man.

1561
01:47:48.462 --> 01:47:50.462
You gotta let your hands go.
Let your hands go. ok?

1562
01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:55.426
Boy. that is exactly what the fuck
I’m talking about. Keep that pressure on.

1563
01:47:55.427 --> 01:47:58.387
Do not let him come out of that
corner throwing a single punch.

1564
01:47:58.388 --> 01:48:01.765
Tee off on this fucking kid! Do you
hear me?

1565
01:48:01.766 --> 01:48:03.767
I hear you. This is your
fight baby. This is your fight.

1566
01:48:03.768 --> 01:48:06.145
It’s not working. coach.
Just take a deep breath. I don’t

1567
01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:08.856
know if I could keep going.
–Relax. relax. relax. Breathe.

1568
01:48:08.857 --> 01:48:16.857
Take it easy. That’s it. Deep
