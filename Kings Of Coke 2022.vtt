He loved what he did.
He loved to perform in court.

27

28
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.120
I'd rather be pleading.
than waiting for a verdict.

29
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.400

37
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.000
some idea of the nature of
the proof. if any.

38
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.280
some idea of the nature of
the proof. if any.

39
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.600

was not just the death

40
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.960
of Sidney Leithman. it gave life
to a whole new story.

41
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.600
When the police start going through
Sidney's clothing.

42
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.000
in one of his pockets they find
a hand-written phone number.

43
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.040
in one of his pockets they find
a hand-written phone number.

44
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.120
That phone number was the key that
opened the door to the power

45
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.000
of the drug trade and the massive
corruption that it had created.

46
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.760

47
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.720
Montreal is a very sexy.
appealing. seductive city.

48
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.000
It became perhaps the most
criminal city in North America.

49
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.520
It became perhaps the most
criminal city in North America.

50
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.080
A lot of us became acquainted with
the criminal element.

51
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.000
the criminal character of Montreal
at a very early age.

52
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.160
the criminal character of Montreal
at a very early age.

53
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.680
You're a kid and you're going to
the candy store

54
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.000
and up there is Allo Police.
a weekly crime tabloid.

55
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.040
and up there is Allo Police.
a weekly crime tabloid.

56
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.920
What other city has
a weekly crime tabloid?

57
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.000
Well. in fact. Montreal had two
weekly crime tabloids!

58
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.160
Well. in fact. Montreal had two
weekly crime tabloids!

59
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.000
And in Montreal.
criminals can be heroes.

60
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.080
And in Montreal.
criminals can be heroes.

61
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.120
When I was a kid.
my father was a city columnist for

62
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.000
The Montreal Star
and he covered the waterfront.

63
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.360
The Montreal Star
and he covered the waterfront.

64
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.040
I remember one time he had a desk at
home and there were all these

65
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.280
mugshots of the West End Gang.

66
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.560
So I was fascinated by
these mugshots.

67
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.200
The West End Gang was legendary.

68
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.000
Dunie Ryan was a very. very. very
sharp criminal operator.

69
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.880
Dunie Ryan was a very. very. very
sharp criminal operator.

70
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.560
Very intelligent guy.
He's at the top.

71
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.880
Allan Ross was Dunie Ryan's
right hand man.

72
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.000
He was considered
a nasty piece of work.

73
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.200
He was considered
a nasty piece of work.

74
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.880
Gerry Matticks was like a toll
booth through the Port.

75
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.000
He could get your big shipment of
cocaine through

76
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.280
He could get your big shipment of
cocaine through

77
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.120
but that came with a price.

78
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.000
The West End Gang is great because
it's actually not a gang.

79
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.080
The West End Gang is great because
it's actually not a gang.

80
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.800
it's a network of people.
It's very flexible.

81
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.840
You also don't give the police
a structure to look at.

82
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.120
...26 tonnes found at
the port of Montreal.

83
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.000
On board 200 million
dollars of pure cocaine.

84
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.640
On board 200 million
dollars of pure cocaine.

85
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.800
The West End Gang was
an extraordinary surprise to us.

86
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.000
You've got small time hoods that
rose up and had the initiative

87
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.680
You've got small time hoods that
rose up and had the initiative

88
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.400
to go down and meet personally with
Colombian Cartel guys

89
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.000
- that's ambition.
that's gutsy too.

90
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.680
- that's ambition.
that's gutsy too.

91
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.400
Those are dangerous people.

92
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.840
They became an organisation
with global power.

93
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.000
an organisation that imports
tons and tons of cocaine

94
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.440
an organisation that imports
tons and tons of cocaine

95
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.080
into the United States
and into Canada.

96
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.000
Montreal had pretty solid divides
with its various gangs.

97
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.280
Montreal had pretty solid divides
with its various gangs.

98
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.520
On the East end. you would have
the French Canadian Gangs.

99
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.440
In the North End you had
the Italian Mafia.

100
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.480
And in the West. you had
the West End Gang -

101
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.000
the Irish neighbourhood gangsters.

102
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.280
the Irish neighbourhood gangsters.

103
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.440
When I was a kid. the West End
neighbourhood was a perfect

104
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.000
breeding ground for that gang
to rise up there.

105
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.080
breeding ground for that gang
to rise up there.

106
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.880
Everybody knew someone.
a family member. a close friend.

107
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.000
who was in some way absolutely
connected to the West End Gang.

108
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.320
who was in some way absolutely
connected to the West End Gang.

109
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.960
When my dad was in his early 30s
he went into the police department.

110
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
but then he saw
a side that he didn't like.

111
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.080
but then he saw
a side that he didn't like.

112
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.920
that he realised they weren't
necessarily the good guys.

113
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.600
And the gangs were the bad guys.

114
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.280
So he was disillusioned
and he eventually left.

115
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.200
Later on as a kid. I heard him being
referred to as "the enforcer"

116
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.920
and I asked my mother about it and
said "Mom. what does that mean?"

117
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.000
and she just pretended
she didn't hear me

118
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.720
and she just pretended
she didn't hear me

119
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.720
and never did answer the question.

120
00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.240
The members of the West End Gang.
they grew up poor. All of them.

121
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.000
And it was a hardscrabble life.

122
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.960
And it was a hardscrabble life.

123
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.040
They were tough. Irish.
working-class kids

124
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.000
who grew up with similar backgrounds

125
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.120
who grew up with similar backgrounds

126
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.040
and that made them
very tough criminals.

127
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.240
How old were you when you
robbed your first bank?

128
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.920
Fourteen.

129
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.000

doing like they do in the movies.
you know.

133
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.000
and wanting the money
and they could see it.

134
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.040
and wanting the money
and they could see it.

135
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.000

holdups in the city every year.

banks a week. some twice.

170
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.560
We used to rob a minimum of three
banks a week. some twice.

171
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.960
That's how open they were.

172
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Everybody was robbing banks.
it was in and out.

173
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.520
Everybody was robbing banks.
it was in and out.

174
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.760
it was quick. it was easy.

175
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.400
Like. one manager knew
it was me again!

176
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.000
Back in those days.
things were really. really happening

177
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.680
Back in those days.
things were really. really happening

178
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.440
in Montreal. You say to yourself:
"Imagine this happening today?"

179
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.000
It was a crazy. crazy time.
Everybody was a bank robber.

180
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.240
It was a crazy. crazy time.
Everybody was a bank robber.

181
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.240
Dunie Ryan was a kind of punk.

182
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.000
By the time he was 19.

183
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.080
By the time he was 19.

184
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.120
he had already been in juvenile
detention homes a couple of times.

185
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.000
He was well immersed in that life.
He was a thief.

186
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.840
He was well immersed in that life.
He was a thief.

187
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.880
He was robbing jewellery stores.

188
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.000
If you opened at nine. they were
there with a gun to your head

189
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
If you opened at nine. they were
there with a gun to your head

190
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.000
to help you open up the store.
you know. and take what you had.

191
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.600
to help you open up the store.
you know. and take what you had.

192
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.840
In his 20's he's involved
in armed robberies.

193
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.000
He goes on a trip to the U.S.
with some guys

194
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.120
He goes on a trip to the U.S.
with some guys

195
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.480
and they are going to do
a string of bank robberies

196
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.680
and they get jacked.

197
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.000
They get caught in
Lynn. Massachusetts. near Boston.

198
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.720
They get caught in
Lynn. Massachusetts. near Boston.

199
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.000
He was in a penitentiary for
five years in the U.S.

200
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.000
Now 30 years old.
he comes back to Montreal

201
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Now 30 years old.
he comes back to Montreal

202
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.640
and that's when he forms what would
be known as the West End Gang.

203
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.400
In 1961. I was 22 years old

204
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.000
and I decided to join
the police force.

205
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.080
and I decided to join
the police force.

206
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.880
You made yourself a reputation.
you know.

207
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.000
and I was glad of my reputation.

208
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.800
and I was glad of my reputation.

209
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.200
You know.
don't fuck around with Savard.

210
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.000
Andre Savard -

211
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.200
Andre Savard -

212
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.760
top of the cop list in Montreal.

213
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.000
Would do anything to make an arrest
within the boundaries of the law.

214
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.960
Would do anything to make an arrest
within the boundaries of the law.

215
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.880
He took crap from no one.

216
00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.000
My first job. standing guard
at the Botanical Garden.

217
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.280
My first job. standing guard
at the Botanical Garden.

218
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.560
You know. I'm armed with a gun
and I'm a police officer

219
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.000
and don't step on the flowers.
you know.

220
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.840
and don't step on the flowers.
you know.

221
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.360
If you do. well.
who knows what's going to happen.

222
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.960
So I needed some action.
some real police work.

223
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.000
The hold up squad was busier
than at any other time.

224
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.560
The hold up squad was busier
than at any other time.

225
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.120
because the capital of robbery
was Montreal.

226
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.920
That started the whole thing with me
working at the Holdup Squad.

227
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.000
The West End Gang were considered
good 'bad guys' in the sense that

228
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.320
The West End Gang were considered
good 'bad guys' in the sense that

229
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.840
initially they were not dealing
drugs. they had not killed anybody.

230
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.520
There was a guy John Slawvey.
that was part of the Gang.

231
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.880
They called him Big John.
Big John Slawvey.

232
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.520
because he weighed something
like 240 pounds

233
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.000
and he also was really mean.

234
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.080
and he also was really mean.

235
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.200
He hated cops with a vengeance.

236
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.000
Dunie was close to Slawvey
and he was a big guy.

237
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.920
Dunie was close to Slawvey
and he was a big guy.

238
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.560
Dunie liked him a lot.

239
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.000
There was a cop that was doing
traffic. he was in front of Simpsons

240
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.320
There was a cop that was doing
traffic. he was in front of Simpsons

241
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.040
and he was writing a ticket

242
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.000
and John Slawvey with two other guys
came out of the Simpsons Building

243
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.600
and John Slawvey with two other guys
came out of the Simpsons Building

244
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.040
because they just
committed an armed robbery.

245
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.000
They could have left.

246
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.480
They could have left.

247
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.920
the cop was writing a ticket -
he wouldn't see this.

248
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.360
they were in the back of him.
So he yelled at the cop. Slawvey.

249
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.000
so the cop turned around...

250
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.720
so the cop turned around...

251
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.000
..almost cut him in half. you know.
with a machine gun.

252
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.200
..almost cut him in half. you know.
with a machine gun.

253
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.160
It didn't take long for police to
find out from their informants

254
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.000
that John Slawvey was the killer.

255
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.120
that John Slawvey was the killer.

256
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.000
but they didn't have enough evidence
to arrest him.

257
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.000
Later on we heard about him.
that he was glad at what he did.

258
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.800
Later on we heard about him.
that he was glad at what he did.

259
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.200
it was like a trophy for him.

260
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.520
He used to go shoot at some target
and write" police" on top.

261
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.000
you know. just shoot him.

262
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.160
you know. just shoot him.

263
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.000
For a long time. the West End Gang
was just a bunch of guys

264
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
For a long time. the West End Gang
was just a bunch of guys

265
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.880
from the Irish neighbourhood.

266
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.000
It wasn't until they started killing
people that they became a threat.

267
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.480
It wasn't until they started killing
people that they became a threat.

268
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.400
They are frightening people.

269
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.000
They would kill you as soon
as they looked at you.

270
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.400
They would kill you as soon
as they looked at you.

271
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.760
They just don't care.

272
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.000
The eyes of the world were all
on Montreal in 1976

273
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.040
The eyes of the world were all
on Montreal in 1976

274
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.400
because of the arrival
of the Olympics.

275
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.000
Law and order suddenly became
critical in presenting

276
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.840
Law and order suddenly became
critical in presenting

277
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.360
a clean image to the world.

278
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.000
Unfortunately the reality basically
whacked them in the face.

279
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.600
Unfortunately the reality basically
whacked them in the face.

280
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.000
It was a crime that stunned
the Montreal police

281
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.280
It was a crime that stunned
the Montreal police

282
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.080
because of its audacity.

283
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.920
The Brinks truck arrived
at the bank to pick up currency

284
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.160
in all denominations.

285
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.000
Gunmen in a white van backed up
behind the truck.

286
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.160
Gunmen in a white van backed up
behind the truck.

287
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.640
blocking the alley.

288
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.760
And when the door was flung open.
the remaining guard faced this:

289
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.000
a 50 calibre anti-aircraft gun.

290
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
a 50 calibre anti-aircraft gun.

291
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.680
The driver of the second vehicle got
out and went to the door

292
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.680
of the Brinks truck.
'Open the truck.'

293
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.000
Those were the only words said
during the whole affair

294
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.520
Those were the only words said
during the whole affair

295
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.880
and they were said in English.

296
00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.680
The gunmen escaped with the largest
holdup haul in Quebec history:

297
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.000
$2.8 million dollars.

298
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.560
$2.8 million dollars.

299
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.080
SAVARD:
It was definitely the West End Gang.

300
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.000
Because nobody else could be
involved in such a robbery.

301
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.240
Because nobody else could be
involved in such a robbery.

302
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.880
We knew that the Irish organised
crime in Boston and Montreal

303
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.080
are connected.

304
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.000
Who is gonna be able to get
a 50-calibre machine gun?

305
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.440
Who is gonna be able to get
a 50-calibre machine gun?

306
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.880
But of course it comes from
the States. you know.

307
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.000
and who's got those contacts?

308
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.240
and who's got those contacts?

309
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.760
Police say they know who is
responsible. they just don't have

310
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.200
enough evidence to make
the charges stick.

311
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.280
I went to see my boss.
the inspector. at the time.

312
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.120
I asked him.
"Why don't you let me do something."

313
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.000
He told me "Yes you can do it.
Andre. but be careful.

314
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.400
He told me "Yes you can do it.
Andre. but be careful.

315
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.760
Don't overdo it."
I had a tendency of overdoing it.

316
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.000
"Don't be a Dirty Harry."
that's what he was telling me.

317
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.840
"Don't be a Dirty Harry."
that's what he was telling me.

318
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.000
In order to shake
the organised crime.

319
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.560
In order to shake
the organised crime.

320
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:32.000
the best way we could. legally. was
to do some things that weren't done.

321
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.320
the best way we could. legally. was
to do some things that weren't done.

322
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.680
You were stepping out of the rule
book a little bit. you know.

323
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.000
Police! Open the door.

324
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.480
Police! Open the door.

325
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.240
O'CONNOR: They went about rousting
people they thought might be members

326
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.880
of the West End Gang.

327
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.000
Hands up police. Come on. Open up.

328
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.200
Hands up police. Come on. Open up.

329
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.000
Night after night after night.
they would go to different places

330
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.120
Night after night after night.
they would go to different places

331
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.760
where they knew West End Gang
members would hang out

332
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.040
and they would find guns.
they would find money

333
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.680
but nothing directly connected to
the Brinks robbery.

334
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.960
We hit all these places.

335
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.960
Nittolo's. Peg's -
every motel we hit them. you know.

336
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
We're bothering the West End Gang.

337
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.480
We're bothering the West End Gang.

338
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:27.040
Dunie Ryan did not take kindly to
the fact that they were being
rousted

339
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.000
night after night by Andre Savard.

340
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.200
night after night by Andre Savard.

341
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.000
I'm patrolling near Motel Peg
with one of my men.

342
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.120
I'm patrolling near Motel Peg
with one of my men.

343
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.400
and that's what we did before
we're going to hit some place.

344
00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.000
I was driving the car and passing
Motel Peg's. we heard a loud bang.

345
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.400
I was driving the car and passing
Motel Peg's. we heard a loud bang.

346
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.680
I didn't know what it was.
so I swung and hit the fence.

347
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.080
A couple of rifle bullets went
through the back window

348
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.000
of their unmarked car.

349
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.560
of their unmarked car.

350
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.240
Within a week or so Savard found out
that Dunie's friend John Slawvey.

351
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.000
who was the cop killer. was going
around boasting to the other guys

352
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.720
who was the cop killer. was going
around boasting to the other guys

353
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.360
how he had shot at Savard

354
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.560
because of the problems he was
causing the West End Gang.

355
00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.800
I knew who the guy was so we went to
arrest him -

356
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.680
there was no way we were going to
take any chances.

357
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.840
And that's when they laid a trap
to arrest Slawvey

358
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.480
at his apartment building.

359
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.160
I got two cops with me. young cops.

360
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.600
They were never involved
in any shootings.

361
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.000
So they gonna be nervous. you know.
especially a guy like that.

362
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.960
So they gonna be nervous. you know.
especially a guy like that.

363
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.520
He killed a cop.
He doesn't mind killing cops.

364
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.000
So we waited in the garage
till he got in. you know.

365
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.400
So we waited in the garage
till he got in. you know.

366
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.600
just like an old movie.

367
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.320
You hear the car going in.

368
00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.160
It takes a long time. you don't hear
anything - what's going on.

369
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.000
you know?

370
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.400
you know?

371
00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.680
And then we start hearing steps.

372
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.000
The guy is walking. I can hear him.

373
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.840
The guy is walking. I can hear him.

374
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.440
So when he comes I yell at him
"Police" and then he stops

375
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.000
and looks at me and he said:
"I'm not armed. I'm not armed".

376
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.640
and looks at me and he said:
"I'm not armed. I'm not armed".

377
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.200
so I move forward. you know.

378
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.000
Then all I can remember and I seen
something shiny in his coat.

379
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.040
Then all I can remember and I seen
something shiny in his coat.

380
00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.200
right here and then he made a move.

381
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.000
Well I had to make a decision and
it was a quick decision.

382
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.080
Well I had to make a decision and
it was a quick decision.

383
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.520
I don't know if it's a gun.
you know. I shot him.

384
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.000
And then I heard...

385
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.080
And then I heard...

386
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.960
My two partners - they shot him.
so he fell down.

387
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.680
They put something like 27 bullets
into John Slawvey.

388
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.240
His girlfriend later said he was
reaching for his cigarettes.

389
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.520
That he didn't have a gun with him.

390
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:24.000
The investigation found that there
was a gun lying beside Slawvey's
body

391
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.160
The investigation found that there
was a gun lying beside Slawvey's
body

392
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.200
but another cop told me "Of course
there would be a gun there.

393
00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.280
It probably was a throw away."

394
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.000
But I know it was.
because I was there.

395
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.640
But I know it was.
because I was there.

396
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.000
There can be many different
suspicions. you know.

397
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.560
There can be many different
suspicions. you know.

398
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.160
maybe you shouldn't have shot him.

399
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.560
maybe a lot of things
I shouldn't have done

400
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.320
but I didn't take a chance.

401
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.000
I'm alive and he's dead.
I did what I had to do.

402
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.360
I'm alive and he's dead.
I did what I had to do.

403
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.920
I would have been stupid to do
anything otherwise because

404
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.360
I would have been killed if not
there somewhere else.

405
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.000
maybe another cop
would have been killed.

406
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.720
maybe another cop
would have been killed.

407
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.800
I've got no regrets.

408
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.920
Dunie and Slawvey were great pals
and people in the West End Gang were

409
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.000
really upset by the way he died.

410
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.280
really upset by the way he died.

411
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.720
they felt he was murdered by Savard.
That was a bad scene.

412
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.280
Then there was a $50.000 contract
put out on Savard's life.

413
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.400
Dunie Ryan certainly
wanted our heads.

414
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.040
And Savard himself
had to be protected.

415
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.000
I had a .44 Magnum
which Dirty Harry had.

416
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.080
I had a .44 Magnum
which Dirty Harry had.

417
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.160
I always put my .44 Magnum
under the bed.

418
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.000
We are not easy targets. you know.

419
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.480
We are not easy targets. you know.

420
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.960
So we are not going to let ourselves
get killed

421
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.760
without defending ourselves.

422
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.880
Montreal had Allo Police -
a weekly crime tabloid.

423
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.120
I was fascinated by it.

424
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.000
The Head of the West End Gang.

425
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.120
The Head of the West End Gang.

426
00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.760
My father got me a job at
The Montreal Gazette as a copy boy.

427
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.000
As a journalist. I veered into crime

428
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.960
As a journalist. I veered into crime

429
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.520
and became an investigative
crime reporter.

430
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.000
I did a magazine story
about Dunie Ryan.

431
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.920
I did a magazine story
about Dunie Ryan.

432
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.600
And this was a really interesting
figure because what he was doing

433
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.240
was fairly sophisticated.

434
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.320
That story was important to
my career and it led to

435
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.040
other stories unfolding.

436
00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.480
I have never seen these
photos before.

437
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.000
It took a long time to find small
pieces of information about Dunie.

438
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.720
It took a long time to find small
pieces of information about Dunie.

439
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.000
Because he was
a very evasive criminal.

440
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.120
That's what he needed to be.

441
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.840
That was part of what made him great
at what he did.

442
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.880
O'CONNOR: In the 1980's.

443
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.000
the West End Gang was getting
involved in more serious crimes

444
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.760
the West End Gang was getting
involved in more serious crimes

445
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.960
that just robbing a bank
here and there.

446
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Dunie Ryan realised the big money
to be made was in drugs.

447
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.640
Dunie Ryan realised the big money
to be made was in drugs.

448
00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.640
I think the secret of the
West End Gang is that an opportunity

449
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.360
came and they saw it.

450
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.320
They are the right people
at the right time in the right place

451
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.640
and they realise this.
and that was the key.

452
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.000
In the 80's it was like everybody
was suddenly selling

453
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.640
In the 80's it was like everybody
was suddenly selling

454
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.480
and doing cocaine.

455
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.600
There was. like. an explosion of it.

456
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.000
Everybody loved coke. The dark side
of cocaine hadn't kicked in yet.

457
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.200
Everybody loved coke. The dark side
of cocaine hadn't kicked in yet.

458
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.200
This very. very desired product
was coming in containers

459
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.760
and everyone had to get it through
that Port and they had to ask

460
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.000
permission from the West End Gang.

461
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.720
permission from the West End Gang.

462
00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.080
REPORTER: 26 tonnes found at
the port of Montreal.

463
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.000
Quebec Police investigators
determined it belonged to a group

464
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.400
Quebec Police investigators
determined it belonged to a group

465
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.800
of suspected drug traffickers
known as the Matticks clan.

466
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.120
Well. the Matticks family has been
interesting every police department

467
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.000
ever since we're police officers.

468
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.400
ever since we're police officers.

469
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.960
The Port of Montreal was controlled
by the Irish Mob

470
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
and Gerald Matticks was in charge of
hiring people.

471
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.240
and Gerald Matticks was in charge of
hiring people.

472
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.920
He was the lynchpin.

473
00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.000
Everyone knew Gerry Matticks and
Dunie Ryan worked hand in hand
together.

474
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.400
Everyone knew Gerry Matticks and
Dunie Ryan worked hand in hand
together.

475
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:44.000
I've covered Hells Angels leaders in
trials. I've covered Mafia leaders.

476
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.280
I've covered Hells Angels leaders in
trials. I've covered Mafia leaders.

477
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:49.720
Gerry Matticks was different.
Gerry Matticks had personality

478
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.000
that I never saw in any of the other
criminals that I have covered.

479
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.440
that I never saw in any of the other
criminals that I have covered.

480
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.960
He had a sense of humour.
He had charisma.

481
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
There was something about him that
made you smile even though

482
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.800
There was something about him that
made you smile even though

483
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.000
you knew that he could stick a shiv
in your back as easily as not.

484
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.320
you knew that he could stick a shiv
in your back as easily as not.

485
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.120
What Matticks would later say is.
on any given day I could just touch

486
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.000
the side of my nose and a container
that was up on a crane could go on

487
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.480
the side of my nose and a container
that was up on a crane could go on

488
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.440
the right truck that would get out
of the Port without being inspected.

489
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.560
The port of Montreal was the first
choice for many drug traffickers

490
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.600
because once it lands in Montreal.
it's a real launching point

491
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.000
to where you wanted
to distribute your cocaine.

492
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.280
to where you wanted
to distribute your cocaine.

493
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:39.000
The open door to the importation of
narcotics in Canada

494
00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.000
and in the United States.

495
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.840
and in the United States.

496
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.320
It passes through Montreal
to go to New York.

497
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.000
Cocaine changed what were
formally small gangs.

498
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.760
Cocaine changed what were
formally small gangs.

499
00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.600
And that's why the West End Gang
suddenly came to light

500
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.000
as a major player
in the Montreal underworld.

501
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.640
as a major player
in the Montreal underworld.

502
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.600
The battle amongst all of these
organised crime groups to control

503
00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.000
the cocaine industry
exploded into gangland slayings

504
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.480
the cocaine industry
exploded into gangland slayings

505
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.000
and corruption seemed to creep into
every aspect of the city.

506
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:12.760
and corruption seemed to creep into
every aspect of the city.

507
00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.440
Montreal...

508
00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.680
These days a city of many coffins.

509
00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.000
By Victoria Day.
a hundred murders in Quebec.

510
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.240
By Victoria Day.
a hundred murders in Quebec.

511
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:32.280
Things got so bad that
the government was forced to set up

512
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.120
a public inquiry
into organised crime

513
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.000
and suddenly the ugliness
just came to the surface.

514
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
and suddenly the ugliness
just came to the surface.

515
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.640
It's a frightening picture of
underworld operations

516
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.920
and the operators.

517
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.360
A nightly TV show in
Quebec featuring a police inquiry

518
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.760
and starring a host of lawyers
and gangsters.

519
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.000
Underworld figures whose faces were
barely known are becoming as

520
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.680
Underworld figures whose faces were
barely known are becoming as

521
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.880
familiar as the Montreal Canadiens.

522
00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:00.000
It was a big hit. you got
a Crime Commission that's filming

523
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.280
It was a big hit. you got
a Crime Commission that's filming

524
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.760
testimonies of gangsters.
Yeah. it's a hell of a reality show.

525
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.000
They hauled Dunie Ryan and
Gerry Matticks

526
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.560
They hauled Dunie Ryan and
Gerry Matticks

527
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.600
in front of the Commission

528
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.840
but they see them as
truck hijackers. bank robbers

529
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.000
and money launderers.

530
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.400
and money launderers.

531
00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.440
They miss the fact that they have
now become the biggest drug dealers.

532
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.000
far out shining the Mafia
and the French Canadian gangs.

533
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.760
far out shining the Mafia
and the French Canadian gangs.

534
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.760
When Dunie was called up to testify.

535
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.000
he said. "I bury my money in
the ground." and in fact he did.

536
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.680
he said. "I bury my money in
the ground." and in fact he did.

537
00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.560
So obviously they don't have enough
evidence to charge him with
anything.

538
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.000
So they slip away into their own
dark area without anybody

539
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.920
So they slip away into their own
dark area without anybody

540
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.000
really understanding that the status
of these gangs is now altered

541
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.240
really understanding that the status
of these gangs is now altered

542
00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.120
to a point where real power is
with The West End Gang.

543
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:11.880
The Italians and the biker gangs had
been the main distributors of
cocaine.

544
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.000
These upstart Irish guys started
muscling in on their territory.

545
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.720
These upstart Irish guys started
muscling in on their territory.

546
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.000
There were threats made for them
to stay out of the business.

547
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.440
There were threats made for them
to stay out of the business.

548
00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.560
The Irish wouldn't take that
lying down.

549
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.280
They just continued to expand
the business.

550
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:36.000
This flood of cocaine poured into
the Ports...

551
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:36.400
This flood of cocaine poured into
the Ports...

552
00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.600
..a huge challenge for the RCMP
because we are dealing with

553
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.000
international drug smuggling
of a serious drug

554
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.120
international drug smuggling
of a serious drug

555
00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.560
that is bringing unbelievable
amounts of money in

556
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.400
and exiting out of the country.

557
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.120
Half a ton of cocaine was
introduced as evidence at the trial.

558
00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.000
500 kilos that came all the way from
South America destined for

559
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.440
500 kilos that came all the way from
South America destined for

560
00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.960
the New York market.

561
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
The cocaine never got there -
the RCMP got their hands on it
first.

562
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.040
The cocaine never got there -
the RCMP got their hands on it
first.

563
00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.800
And the man who was at the head
of this investigation

564
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.680
was Claude Savoie.

565
00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.000
We all have different theories on
things but until you see something.

566
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.640
We all have different theories on
things but until you see something.

567
00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.640
This proves that large
quantities do come in -

568
00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.000
500 kilos. again. is the largest
seizure ever made in Canada.

569
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.480
500 kilos. again. is the largest
seizure ever made in Canada.

570
00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.600
He was considered a good cop.
a clean cop

571
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.000
and he was respected by the people
who worked for him.

572
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:32.360
and he was respected by the people
who worked for him.

573
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.440
Everybody liked him. good guy.
backed you up. all the rest of it.

574
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.000
I met Savoie.
we started a joint project with

575
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.440
I met Savoie.
we started a joint project with

576
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.120
the Montreal Police Drug Squad
and the RCMP.

577
00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.000
And I found Savoie to be a good guy.
a comfortable guy to be with.

578
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.480
And I found Savoie to be a good guy.
a comfortable guy to be with.

579
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.000
They've got this small little gang
that suddenly pops out

580
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.600
They've got this small little gang
that suddenly pops out

581
00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:01.360
and becomes a major player in
cocaine and now Claude Savoie

582
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.000
has to be looking at Dunie Ryan.

583
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.040
has to be looking at Dunie Ryan.

584
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.000
The power and reach of the West End
Gang was growing quite significantly

585
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.920
The power and reach of the West End
Gang was growing quite significantly

586
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.800
so they made sure they
had the kind of lawyer

587
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.720
with the brazen talent

588
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.000
and connections within
the justice system

589
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.360
and connections within
the justice system

590
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.280
they needed to help protect
their criminal empire.

591
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.320
And that man was Sidney Leithman

592
00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.800
I can't say that.

593
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.000
it's not because a warrant is
issued that the man is guilty.

594
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.400
it's not because a warrant is
issued that the man is guilty.

595
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.640
The first time I saw
Sidney Leithman.

596
00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.000
I was in a courtroom and he walked
in and suddenly the room was

597
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.720
I was in a courtroom and he walked
in and suddenly the room was

598
00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.680
full of Sidney Leithman.

599
00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.200
I mean this guy was sort of
a pastiche of some kind of

600
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.000
Brooklyn mob Lawyer with
the aviator glasses.

601
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Brooklyn mob Lawyer with
the aviator glasses.

602
00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.000
Sidney Leithman was my lawyer.

603
00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.320
I got found not guilty on
a few cases. Great lawyer.

604
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.400
He was a fixer.

605
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.000
He had a lot of judges.
having judges makes cases a lot

606
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.920
He had a lot of judges.
having judges makes cases a lot

607
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.080
easier for you.

608
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.840
You're saying he had
judges in his pocket?

609
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.000
Yup. Oh for sure.
for sure. for sure.

610
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:08.040
Yup. Oh for sure.
for sure. for sure.

611
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:16.000
We knew at some point that Leithman
was very friendly with one judge.

612
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
We knew at some point that Leithman
was very friendly with one judge.

613
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.720
He was renting apartments for him
every once in a while.

614
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.000
he even had a girl.
ya know. a prostitute.

615
00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:31.920
And eventually. he became the lawyer
to a major Montreal crime boss.

616
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.000
Frank Cotroni.

617
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.760
Frank Cotroni.

618
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.600
At the time. the Cotronis were
the most powerful Mafia family

619
00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.840
in Montreal.

620
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.760
Whatever he has done in the past.
he has paid for that

621
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.960
and it shouldn't affect him today.

622
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.040
If you were caught and you were a
member of the underworld of
Montreal.

623
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.000
they cry would go out
"Get me Leithman".

624
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.000
He represented the Italian mafia
guys. the Hell's Angels guys

625
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.640
He represented the Italian mafia
guys. the Hell's Angels guys

626
00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.040
and the West End Gang.

627
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.400
I don't know what
the right answer is?

628
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.000
Sidney became the corporate
lawyer for the West End Gang.

629
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.880
Sidney became the corporate
lawyer for the West End Gang.

630
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.520
He was always there for them.
any time. 24 hours a day.

631
00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.000
seven days a week.
That was Sidney Leithman.

632
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
seven days a week.
That was Sidney Leithman.

633
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.000
Dunie Ryan appreciated him so much
that he gave him an Irish Claddagh
ring.

634
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.320
Dunie Ryan appreciated him so much
that he gave him an Irish Claddagh
ring.

635
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.000
Dunie Ryan really wanted to create
a bond among the people

636
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:28.440
Dunie Ryan really wanted to create
a bond among the people

637
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.000
who worked underneath him and he
made each of them a Claddagh ring.

638
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.000
It's a symbol. it's a heart and it's
two hands pulling on either side

639
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:36.280
It's a symbol. it's a heart and it's
two hands pulling on either side

640
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.480
of the heart.

641
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.360
Leithman said.

642
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.000
"I'm probably the only Jew in the
city that is wearing one of these
rings."

643
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.680
"I'm probably the only Jew in the
city that is wearing one of these
rings."

644
00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.320
He was very proud of it and he used
to show it to everybody in court.

645
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.000
He was like a made-man
with that ring.

646
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.920
He was like a made-man
with that ring.

647
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.000
For him to give that ring to
Sidney Leithman.

648
00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.000
to me it's a sign that
a) I trust you.

649
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.640
to me it's a sign that
a) I trust you.

650
00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.880
b) it's possible that Mr Leithman
was facilitating his crimes.

651
00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:08.000
He got involved in levels of drug
dealing that he should have never

652
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.240
He got involved in levels of drug
dealing that he should have never

653
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.440
ever been a part of.

654
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.000
And once you do that.
you are caught by this group now.

655
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.800
And once you do that.
you are caught by this group now.

656
00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:24.000
You are no longer their lawyer.
you're their slave.

657
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.280
You are no longer their lawyer.
you're their slave.

658
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.000
The Brinks robbery was something
that ate at Andre Savard for years.

659
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.320
The Brinks robbery was something
that ate at Andre Savard for years.

660
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.240
Andre would not let go of it.

661
00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.000
I'm mad at them like hell.

662
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.400
I'm mad at them like hell.

663
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.120
so I am going to put them in jail.
arrest them. That's my vengeance.

664
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.000
After the Brinks hold-up
police combed the city for clues.

665
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.760
After the Brinks hold-up
police combed the city for clues.

666
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.560
Police killed suspect
John Slawvey in a shootout.

667
00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.000
Four years later police raided
this house on Greene Avenue.

668
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.040
Four years later police raided
this house on Greene Avenue.

669
00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.520
Under these floorboards they found
almost $290.000.

670
00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.000
believed part of the Brinks loot.

671
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.320
believed part of the Brinks loot.

672
00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.040
Slawvey lived at
the Greene avenue house.

673
00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.000
That was one crime that really got
under his skin.

674
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.160
That was one crime that really got
under his skin.

675
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.440
Eight years later.

676
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.360
he finally caught most of the
perpetrators of the Brink robbery.

677
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.000
The indictment charges
five persons with conspiracy

678
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.080
The indictment charges
five persons with conspiracy

679
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.000
and armed robbery about $3 million.

680
00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.000
Only the small fry who were involved
in it get tried and sentenced.

681
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.800
Only the small fry who were involved
in it get tried and sentenced.

682
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:34.280
The leaders of the Brinks robbery.
the guys who put it together.

683
00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.680
get off scot free.

684
00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:43.280
Not guilty? Tabarnac. not guilty?

685
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.000
That was worse than
the O.J. Simpson case.

686
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.960
That was worse than
the O.J. Simpson case.

687
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.320
This was unbelievable.

688
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.960
What the hell do you want. you know?

689
00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.560
So...

690
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:59.760
So in 1984.
after the Brink's investigation.

691
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.000
I decided that it was time for me
to go to the top job

692
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.280
I decided that it was time for me
to go to the top job

693
00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.680
where I think being a homicide cop
was at the top.

694
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.960
Many years ago. my mother had to
send me to an orphanage.

695
00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.880
I always had a tendency
to stand up for the little guy.

696
00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.240
I had to defend them.
you know. somehow.

697
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:28.000
Being a cop. the best way to do this
would be to stop people from

698
00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.760
killing each other.

699
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.880
And it became like an obsession.

700
00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.840
Dunie Tyan would operate and hold
court in various motels

701
00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.000
in the West end of Montreal.

702
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.560
in the West end of Montreal.

703
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.800
He spends a lot of time hanging out
at Nitillo's on Upper Lachine Road.

704
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.520
When I was 15 years old.
I got my first real job

705
00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.600
as a busboy at Nittolo's.

706
00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.760
And it was a very respected place

707
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.000
but there was also
a criminal element to it.

708
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.320
but there was also
a criminal element to it.

709
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.000
That's where members of
the West End Gang.

710
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.880
That's where members of
the West End Gang.

711
00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:17.360
most of them Irish guys. would come
and pay homage to Dunie Ryan.

712
00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.000
He was very generous
with his cohorts.

713
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.840
He was very generous
with his cohorts.

714
00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.960
And if they got out of jail Dunie
right away would give the guy money

715
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
to buy new clothes.
a couple of grams of cocaine.

716
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.920
to buy new clothes.
a couple of grams of cocaine.

717
00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.120
And he would keep their loyalty
that way.

718
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.000
What made him. Dunie.
a good crime boss?

719
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.360
What made him. Dunie.
a good crime boss?

720
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.960
He had a good gang.

721
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.400
He just had good people around him
that supported him.

722
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.720
Dunie is running
this powerful business.

723
00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.920
He has a very nice home.

724
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.000
and a 30-foot power yacht
where he entertained his cronies.

725
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.840
and a 30-foot power yacht
where he entertained his cronies.

726
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.720
The money had become almost
a joke to the guys.

727
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.000
It was that much money.
that was the legend.

728
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.040
It was that much money.
that was the legend.

729
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.400
I think there was always
the idea that

730
00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.000
"Hey you could be living this dream.
you could be living this life."

731
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:08.240
"Hey you could be living this dream.
you could be living this life."

732
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.800
They sold that dream very well and
the younger people who were

733
00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.960
at the bottom looked up to them
and thought they were so cool

734
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
and be like them one day
and they bought the lie.

735
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.040
and be like them one day
and they bought the lie.

736
00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.120
They lived the high life
in every way.

737
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.000
And meanwhile none of that trickled
down back to the people

738
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
And meanwhile none of that trickled
down back to the people

739
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.080
who were working for them.

740
00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:32.000
Wow. it hasn't changed.
My bedroom was right up there.

741
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.400
Wow. it hasn't changed.
My bedroom was right up there.

742
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.440
They didn't share any of
that wealth.

743
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.160
They got to live this lifestyle that
the people in The Point

744
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.000
could only dream of.

745
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.520
could only dream of.

746
00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.000
Dunie Ryan might have been
an honest thief.

747
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.680
Dunie Ryan might have been
an honest thief.

748
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.360
as a lot of people called him.

749
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.320
however if you crossed Dunie.
there could be hell to pay.

750
00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.640
Patrick McGurnaghan was a mid-level
member of the West End Gang.

751
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.000
He owed Dunie about 200.000 bucks
and every time Dunie tried to
collect.

752
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.400
He owed Dunie about 200.000 bucks
and every time Dunie tried to
collect.

753
00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.720
McGurnaghan would blow him off.

754
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.000
Dunie hired Apache Trudeau
who is a Hells Angels guy

755
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.560
Dunie hired Apache Trudeau
who is a Hells Angels guy

756
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.000
also known as the Mad Bomber.

757
00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.440
He was basically a psychopath.

758
00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.000
But he was very handy to be hired
if you wanted somebody killed.

759
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.080
But he was very handy to be hired
if you wanted somebody killed.

760
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.000
Apache Trudeau planted a bomb
underneath McGurnaghan's car

761
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.880
Apache Trudeau planted a bomb
underneath McGurnaghan's car

762
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.720
with a radio device
that would detonate the bomb.

763
00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.000
McGurnaghan gets in his car
and starts driving...

764
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.360
McGurnaghan gets in his car
and starts driving...

765
00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.360
..turns the corner near a park
and a school.

766
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.800
The white 1977 Mercedes
Benz was travelling south about

767
00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.560
quarter to one this afternoon.

768
00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.000
Suddenly a loud explosion. the car
blew apart and came to stop

769
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.440
Suddenly a loud explosion. the car
blew apart and came to stop

770
00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.840
off the side of the road
150 feet away.

771
00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.000
The man just fell out and his arms
and legs were blown off.

772
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.760
The man just fell out and his arms
and legs were blown off.

773
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.480
And that was the end of McGurnaghan.

774
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.000
Dunie had made an example of him.
And the word was out very quickly -

775
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.640
Dunie had made an example of him.
And the word was out very quickly -

776
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.560
you do not fuck with Dunie.

777
00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.200
In that period of time.
I was a homicide cop

778
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.000
and I was involved with an informer
that the West End Gang

779
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.520
and I was involved with an informer
that the West End Gang

780
00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.960
was trying to kill.

781
00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.080
The West End Gang had a lot
of power. complete power.

782
00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.000
because people in The Point knew
there was no line

783
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.800
because people in The Point knew
there was no line

784
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.240
they wouldn't cross.

785
00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:00.000
Because we were so close to the
tracks we could see them bringing

786
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.040
Because we were so close to the
tracks we could see them bringing

787
00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:04.680
a body that they would be able to
distribute along the train track

788
00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.160
because the train can do a lot of
damage to a body

789
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.000
and get rid of the parts.

790
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.840
and get rid of the parts.

791
00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.840
When I was a kid. I came to look
after the train had gone by

792
00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.000
and lying on the dirt
not far from the track.

793
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.400
and lying on the dirt
not far from the track.

794
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.440
I wasn't sure at first what it was.

795
00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.000
and then I realised it
was a hand and sort of kicked it

796
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:24.360
and then I realised it
was a hand and sort of kicked it

797
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.280
a bit with my foot and thought
"Wow".

798
00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.560
I mean the fingertips were
still attached.

799
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.000
it was a complete
hand that hadn't even been crushed.

800
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.040
it was a complete
hand that hadn't even been crushed.

801
00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.160
Violence like that.
it breeds more violence.

802
00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.840
By 1984. Dunie Ryan
is looking over his shoulder.

803
00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.000
wondering how safe
his perch might be.

804
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.560
wondering how safe
his perch might be.

805
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.760
because he knows people
are jealous of him.

806
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:16.240
Dunie had worth
between 50 and 100 million

807
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:20.000
and he did express his concerns
about his own safety

808
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.800
and he did express his concerns
about his own safety

809
00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.960
and he was worried about his kids
being possibly kidnapped.

810
00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.000
The West End Gang was splitting
in some ways. you know?

811
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.520
The West End Gang was splitting
in some ways. you know?

812
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.280
Everybody wanted to take over.
That's the way criminals are.

813
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.680
you know. They want to take over.

814
00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:42.880
In that world. it's a vicious world.
It can come from anywhere.

815
00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.800
Dunie rides to meet up
with some members of his gang

816
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.000
in the bar at Nittolo's.

817
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:52.560
in the bar at Nittolo's.

818
00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.840
That was where he hung out.
did business.

819
00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.000
he wouldn't think twice about
something happening to him there.

820
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:00.160
he wouldn't think twice about
something happening to him there.

821
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:05.560
As Dunie is sitting there.
a fellow by the name of Paul April

822
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.000
approaches his table.

823
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:08.560
approaches his table.

824
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.680
And he owes Dunie Ryan $200.000

825
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.560
and he's scared.

826
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.600
He invites Dunie to a room
at the motel

827
00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.480
where he says he's going to pay him.
give him the money.

828
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.000
Dunie says "OK. let's go."
And off they go to Room 40.

829
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.200
Dunie says "OK. let's go."
And off they go to Room 40.

830
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.000
They walk in there
and out of the bathroom

831
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.280
They walk in there
and out of the bathroom

832
00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:38.920
steps a friend of Paul April's
with a shotgun in his hand.

833
00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.000
Dunie knows he's doomed
unless he gets out of there.

834
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Dunie knows he's doomed
unless he gets out of there.

835
00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.280
He's gotta fight his way
out of there or he's finished.

836
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.000
So he picked up the chair
and smashed it into the window

837
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.920
So he picked up the chair
and smashed it into the window

838
00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.240
to make a break for it.

839
00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.000
He went down swinging.

840
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:04.000
One of Paul April's henchmen
blasts Dunie Ryan in the chest.

841
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.840
One of Paul April's henchmen
blasts Dunie Ryan in the chest.

842
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.520
blows him away.

843
00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.920
'Reputed West End
cocaine dealer Peter Dunie Ryan

844
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.560
was shot to death in a motel
on Upper Lachine Road.

845
00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.000
Who did it is anybody's guess.
but it had to be someone
Ryan trusted

846
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.280
Who did it is anybody's guess.
but it had to be someone
Ryan trusted

847
00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.760
for a killer or killers
to get so close to him

848
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.000
with a 12-gauge shotgun
and a .45 calibre pistol.'

849

with a 12-gauge shotgun
and a .45 calibre pistol.'

850
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.760
He died at 42.
It's a very young age.

851
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.000
Dunie wanted to "Live Fast.
Love Hard and Die Young."

852
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.480
Dunie wanted to "Live Fast.
Love Hard and Die Young."

853
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.000
If that was his motto in life.
then all three wishes came true.

854
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.560
If that was his motto in life.
then all three wishes came true.

855
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.000
unfortunately.

856
00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.000
Dunie's funeral was here.

857
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.280
Dunie's funeral was here.

858
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:07.120
Just not too far away
was where he was killed

859
00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.000
and where he did a lot of business.

860
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.040
and where he did a lot of business.

861
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.760
Dunie Ryan for me was close to home.

862
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.720
I worked at Nittolo's as a kid.

863
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.000
I shot pool as a teenager
at Smitty's. a big hangout of his.

864
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.760
I shot pool as a teenager
at Smitty's. a big hangout of his.

865
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.640
There's more of a familiarity.
a character

866
00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.000
that you're reporting on.
when they've covered the same turf
as you.

867
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.080
that you're reporting on.
when they've covered the same turf
as you.

868
00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.000
The loveable anti-hero.
Maybe he struck that chord in me.

869
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.600
The loveable anti-hero.
Maybe he struck that chord in me.

870
00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.360
One of the things about the West End
Gang that I think is terrible

871
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.520
is how much
we want to romanticise them.

872
00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.000
I always thought
they were pieces of shit.

873
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:56.720
I always thought
they were pieces of shit.

874
00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.400
I don't know why people
looked up to them. I would look
at them

875
00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.200
and think. "Fuck you. You're not
the hero that you think you are.

876
00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.000
or that you want to pretend
you are."

877
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.480
or that you want to pretend
you are."

878
00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.240
They were bullies who were just
taking advantage of people

879
00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.560
who were vulnerable.

880
00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.800
A lot of them are not nice people.

881
00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.000
The criminal world is a fucked up
world. there is no doubt about it.

882
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.080
The criminal world is a fucked up
world. there is no doubt about it.

883
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:27.360
When Dunie Ryan was killed.

884
00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.000
Allan Ross. just by the vacancy.

885
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.960
Allan Ross. just by the vacancy.

886
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.760
the vacuum of power. swung in.

887
00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.000
'Allan Ross started out
running errands for Dunie Ryan.

888
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.920
'Allan Ross started out
running errands for Dunie Ryan.

889
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.600
He spent a lot of nights
at this West End motel

890
00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.200
watching Ryan collect millions
from drug-running.'

891
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.000
You could stop Allan Ross
on the street and you could see

892
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.960
You could stop Allan Ross
on the street and you could see

893
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.640
the hate in his eyes for police.
you could see it

894
00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.000
while talking to him. You know.
that scar he had on his face

895
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:52.960
while talking to him. You know.
that scar he had on his face

896
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.240
and his beady eyes looking at you.

897
00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:00.000
He was a violent human being
and if he wanted something.

898
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:00.520
He was a violent human being
and if he wanted something.

899
00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.000
I believe he would have killed you
for it.

900
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.640
Allan Ross would destroy you
if you're not careful.

901
00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:08.000
He was considered
a nasty piece of work.

902
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.280
He was considered
a nasty piece of work.

903
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.680
His nickname was The Weasel.

904
00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.000
Some say it's because
he looked like a ferret.

905
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:16.760
Some say it's because
he looked like a ferret.

906
00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.080
He tried to get away
with everything. he tried not to be

907
00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.000
involved in things and if he was
involved he'd be in the back.

908
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.640
involved in things and if he was
involved he'd be in the back.

909
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:28.120
They called him The Weasel
for a reason. you know.

and now I'm the king."

914
00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.000
I mean. it's laughable. Who are you?

915

I mean. it's laughable. Who are you?

916

Allan Ross knew who was involved
in Dunie Ryan's murder

918
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.840
and he set about getting them.

919

They knew that the gang
was looking. especially Allan Ross

922
00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:11.080
was looking for him
to avenge Dunie Ryan.

It's four in the morning.

Paul April and three of his cronies
are holed up in this apartment.

There's a knock on the door

There's a knock on the door

928
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.640
and who's at the door
but Apache Trudeau?

929
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.000
He's got a gift for Paul April.
It's a video recorder...

It's a video recorder...

..with a tape called 'The History
of the Hell's Angels in Montreal.'

932
00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.000
Aren't you a little suspicious
about this at four in the morning?

933
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.320
Aren't you a little suspicious
about this at four in the morning?

934

That it's Apache Trudeau.
for heaven's sake.

935
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.080
You know who this guy is...

They put the tape inside.
It's been wired by Apache Trudeau

They put the tape inside.
It's been wired by Apache Trudeau

so that after it's played
for a couple of minutes...

944
00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.880
The windows come screaming out
onto the street.

what had happened and they thought

what had happened and they thought

was blown away

for Dunie's death
were gonna get killed.

985
00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:04.000
Paul was in a tavern
bragging that he had killed the king

986
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:06.960
and Paul was looking to see
which way the wind was blowing.

987
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.840
And 13 days later. it was
blowing him to hell. Ha-ha!!"

988
00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.280
So one by one
in a very systematic way.

989
00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.000
Allan Ross took out everybody
involved in Dunie Ryan's murder.

990
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.960
Allan Ross took out everybody
involved in Dunie Ryan's murder.

991
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.160
Because as the saying goes.

992
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.000
three people can keep a secret
only if two of them are dead.

993
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.680
three people can keep a secret
only if two of them are dead.

994
00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.360
This was bound to happen
because there was war

995
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:34.680
inside the gang itself.

996
00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.000
The organised crime groups.

997
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.560
The organised crime groups.

998
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.240
they destroy themselves.

999
00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.560
They don't care about anybody
but themselves.

1000
00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.840
And at the end of it all.

1001
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:52.000
Allan Ross had finally secured
his own position

1002
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:52.640
Allan Ross had finally secured
his own position

1003
00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.280
as the new king of
the West End Gang.

1004
00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.600
with his own people.
his own structure

1005
00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.000
and his own way of doing business.

1006
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.520
and his own way of doing business.

1007
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.040
'Ross went on to make more.
much more.

1008
00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.000
Under his command the West End Gang
forged a partnership

1009
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.560
Under his command the West End Gang
forged a partnership

1010
00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:14.320
with the Sicilian Mafia
and Colombia's cocaine cartels.'

1011
00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:24.000
I became the lead attorney
for the organised crime task force

1012
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:24.400
I became the lead attorney
for the organised crime task force

1013
00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:27.680
in north Florida. At that time
every big criminal organisation

1014
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.560
on Planet Earth was in drugs
coming out of Colombia.

1015
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:35.320
We worked the Colombian cartels hard
and the cartel

1016
00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:37.880
that I was primarily interested
in was better armed

1017
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.000
and in greater numbers
than the Colombian army.

1018
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.120
and in greater numbers
than the Colombian army.

1019
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.080
So we're watching everything they do

1020
00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:47.120
and lo and behold there's this guy
from Montreal that shows up.

1021
00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.000
Allan Ross. It's like. "What the
heck is going on with that?"

1022
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.720
Allan Ross. It's like. "What the
heck is going on with that?"

1023
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.960
So we start digging.

1024
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.560
'By the mid 1980s.
Florida drug agents

1025
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:56.000
began secretly investigating Ross.'

1026
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:56.880
began secretly investigating Ross.'

1027
00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:02.200
For a Canadian to go down
and make direct contact
with the Colombian Cartel guys.

1028
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.680
I had never seen that before.

1029
00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.000
We indicted Allan Ross
for being the lead figure

1030
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.720
We indicted Allan Ross
for being the lead figure

1031
00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:11.920
to traffic in illegal drugs
in the United States. Canada

1032
00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:12.000
and elsewhere. You seal
the indictment

1033
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.480
and elsewhere. You seal
the indictment

1034
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.360
so they don't know
you are coming for them.

1035

Inside the container. agents found
a fortune in narcotics.

1039
00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.000
but no-one claimed it.
perhaps because the dealers knew

1040
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.960
but no-one claimed it.
perhaps because the dealers knew

1041
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.560
or suspected that they were
under police surveillance.'

1042
00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:36.000
Ross knew how to play the system.

1043
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:36.360
Ross knew how to play the system.

1044
00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:41.320
He was able to stay ahead
of the justice system in Canada.

1045
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.000
It was embarrassing
and you had to ask yourself

1046
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.360
It was embarrassing
and you had to ask yourself

1047
00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:48.520
what was wrong with the Canadians
that they couldn't get this guy?

1048
00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.760
He's been around for 20 years
doing drugs in Montreal.

1049
00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:52.000
Nobody had the answer at the time.

1050
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.840
Nobody had the answer at the time.

1051
00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:00.000
And nobody believed at the time
that it could possibly be

1052
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:00.040
And nobody believed at the time
that it could possibly be

1053
00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.760

There's a basic rule
for journalists and lawyers

you don't get too close.

when dealing with underworld guys.
you don't get too close.

Nothing is personal here. you don't
go out and drink with them.

You don't get involved
in anything they are involved with.

You don't get involved
in anything they are involved with.

1073
00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.480
that sort of thing.
You keep your distance. You do it

1074

for your own safety. And. uh.
Leithman didn't understand that.

Leithman didn't understand that.

we look for the crooked cops

and Leithman was in our sights.

1078
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:12.880
and Leithman was in our sights.

1079
00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:19.200
He was an important appendage
to Ross's organisation.

1080
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.000
He's the guy that told witnesses
to keep their mouth shut.

He's the guy that told witnesses
to keep their mouth shut.

1082

he's the one that made the deals
with witnesses.
that if you keep your mouth shut

1083

you'll get paid. the guy that
advised Ross. when he had a problem.
who was talking.

1084
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.760
you'll get paid. the guy that
advised Ross. when he had a problem.
who was talking.

1085
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.000
He is no longer a defence lawyer.
he is a felon

1086
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:36.440
He is no longer a defence lawyer.
he is a felon

1087
00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.320
conspiring to obstruct justice.

1088
00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:43.240
'He made headlines taking
on Colombian cartel characters

as clients
and usually got them off.'

1091
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:50.920
He was very well liked
by the cartels down in Colombia.

1092
00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.080
He liked the fact
that they would fly him down.

1093
00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.720
provide him with money. drugs

1094
00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.760
and women. whatever he wanted.

1095
00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:04.480
I think that Leithman
got sucked into a couple of files

1096
00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.840
with the Colombians for the money.
then he got too deep.

1097
00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:08.000
There were rumours that he was
doing coke himself

1098
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000
There were rumours that he was
doing coke himself

1099
00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.680
and if you have an addiction
to any kind of drugs.
you become less trusted.

1100
00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:21.400
'Police intercepted a cargo plane
from Medellin. Colombia.

1101
00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:23.320
It contained half a ton of cocaine.'

1102
00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:30.200
By 1989. the Colombians were
starting to lose faith on Leithman.

1103
00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.440
He was losing cases.

1104
00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:38.120
They were blaming Leithman
for the fact

1105
00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.000
they had lost millions of dollars
in the cocaine being seized.

1106
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.400
they had lost millions of dollars
in the cocaine being seized.

1107
00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:47.120
His dealings
with those types of people.

1108
00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.000
I mean. if you're doing court cases.
you'd better win them.

1109
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.640
I mean. if you're doing court cases.
you'd better win them.

1110
00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.240
And he wasn't winning them.

1111
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:56.000
There was this sense with him
of making promises he can't keep

1112
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:56.800
There was this sense with him
of making promises he can't keep

1113
00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:00.760
and just a man
who you could no longer trust.

1114
00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.000
And in that world.
if you can no longer trust somebody.

1115
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.040
And in that world.
if you can no longer trust somebody.

1116
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.200
that's the end.

1117
00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:12.000
'Sidney Leithman was just
five blocks from his house

were on the scene quickly.

shocked. standing barefoot
in the street.

shocked. standing barefoot

Investigators found some
shell casings on the ground

1123

and they found a bullet
in the grass opposite the car.

1124

They say it went through
the passenger side car window.

1126

hit Leithman. went through
the driver's side window

and then came to a scorching stop
in the grass.'

1128
00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:41.400
To this day. we have no idea
who killed Sidney Leithman.

1129
00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:50.240
This was a man who was involved
with so many different
underworld figures in his life.

1130
00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.000
You never know when or where
or from whom

1131
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.480
You never know when or where
or from whom

1132
00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:56.200
the bullet is going to come.

1133
00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.000
He'd been involved with
the Columbians. with the Mafia

1134
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.400
He'd been involved with
the Columbians. with the Mafia

1135
01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.040
and with the Hell's Angels.

1136
01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.720
And of course he was also deeply
involved with the West End Gang

1137
01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.000
and Allan Ross.

1138
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.040
and Allan Ross.

1139
01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.000
Did he offend somebody.
did he go too far?

1140
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.320
Did he offend somebody.
did he go too far?

1141
01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.200
Was he working too much
with the competition?

1142
01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.000
You just never know.
that's why it's the underworld.

1143
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:24.880
You just never know.
that's why it's the underworld.

1144
01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.000
So unless somebody
actually comes out and confesses.

1145
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.480
So unless somebody
actually comes out and confesses.

1146
01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.920
I'm not sure we will ever find out
what the real story is

1147
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.080
behind Sidney Leithman's death.

1148
01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:56.000
In the summer of '92 I was working
for the CBC TV programme

1149
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:56.040
In the summer of '92 I was working
for the CBC TV programme

1150
01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.400
'The Fifth Estate.'

1151
01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.320
It's the Canadian equivalent
to '60 Minutes.'

1152
01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:04.000
it's a great investigative TV show.

1153
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.200
it's a great investigative TV show.

1154
01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.440
My job was to develop stories
and there were some interesting
developments going on

1155
01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.000
with the drug trade
and the West End Gang.

1156
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:12.760
with the drug trade
and the West End Gang.

1157
01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.560
Dan has great contacts
with the police.

1158
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.880
but he also has great contacts
with the crime community.

1159
01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.000
So when Dan Burke comes to me
and says. "Hey. we should do

1160
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.280
So when Dan Burke comes to me
and says. "Hey. we should do

1161
01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.640
the story on the West End Gang.
it was a natural

1162
01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.000
for us to work on it together.

1163
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:28.800
for us to work on it together.

1164
01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.640
How is it that Allan Ross
gets away for so many years

1165
01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.000
being one of the most powerful
drug traffickers in North America?

1166
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.400
being one of the most powerful
drug traffickers in North America?

1167
01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:42.760
It doesn't take Dan long
to begin to hear whispers.

1168
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.000
Everybody knew Allan Ross
was a criminal and a crime boss.

1169
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.600
Everybody knew Allan Ross
was a criminal and a crime boss.

1170
01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.000
The question was.
why wasn't he getting arrested?

1171
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:52.240
The question was.
why wasn't he getting arrested?

1172
01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.000
And the key there
was Sidney Leithman.

1173
01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.000
So then the question was.
who did Sidney Leithman have

1174
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:00.560
So then the question was.
who did Sidney Leithman have

1175
01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.320
in the police and the judiciary?

1176
01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.280
When big boys don't get arrested.
it's because they have friends.

1177
01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.000
It was standard fare for us.
It wasn't a big question mark.

1178
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.920
It was standard fare for us.
It wasn't a big question mark.

1179
01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.840
The question mark was who. not if.

1180
01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.600
You can probably investigate
Montreal for corruption

1181
01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.000
at any point in history
and have several stories.

1182
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.880
at any point in history
and have several stories.

1183
01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:31.480
But I was left with the impression
that it was unusual

1184
01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.000
how they were operating at the RCMP
drug squad in Montreal under Savoie.

1185
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.680
how they were operating at the RCMP
drug squad in Montreal under Savoie.

1186
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.000
'So this confirmed to us.
because you have to have

1187
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.440
'So this confirmed to us.
because you have to have

1188
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.440
some evidence
to believe something...'
Claude Savoie for many years

1189
01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.000
was the head of the RCMP drug squad.

1190
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:48.760
was the head of the RCMP drug squad.

1191
01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.480
So we're journalists.
we go wherever the leads lead us.

1192
01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.000
Claude Savoie and I met
at an office

1193
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.040
Claude Savoie and I met
at an office

1194
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:03.720
at the RCMP headquarters.
And I had a two-hour conversation
with him.

1195
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.320
I got the sense that he was
a little nervous.

1196
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.080
a little exasperated.

1197
01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.320
Under pressure.

1198
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.000
Well. everybody in the world
knew Allan Ross was a problem.

1199
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.040
Well. everybody in the world
knew Allan Ross was a problem.

1200
01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:42.800
And this guy is telling me
"Well. Allan Ross isn't a problem."

1201
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.000
Jeez. You don't even
have to be a cop to know that.

1202
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.120
Jeez. You don't even
have to be a cop to know that.

1203
01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.480
So if Allan Ross isn't a problem.

1204
01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.000
then maybe Claude Savoie
is a problem. you know?

1205
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.560
then maybe Claude Savoie
is a problem. you know?

1206
01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:00.000
'This is RCMP Inspector
Claude Savoie in late 1990

1207
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:00.560
'This is RCMP Inspector
Claude Savoie in late 1990

1208
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.400
when he was head of the RCMP
drug squad in Montreal.

1209
01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.000
He's talking about why the police
were losing ground to drug dealers.'

1210
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:08.320
He's talking about why the police
were losing ground to drug dealers.'

1211
01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.640
'Well. I am not sure
I can answer that question.

1212
01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.960
Because if I could answer
that question. we could probably
solve the problem

1213
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
and unfortunately we're not doing
a good job at solving the problem
right now.'

1214
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.160
and unfortunately we're not doing
a good job at solving the problem
right now.'

1215
01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:24.000
Not a doubt in my mind
that Claude Savoie would do anything

1216
01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:28.360
illegal or hurt the RCMP
or hurt law enforcement. period.

1217
01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.720
He had a family
and he was just a good guy.

1218
01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.000
We start meeting
with police sources.

1219
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.800
We start meeting
with police sources.

1220
01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:38.960
who are careful.
because they are police.

1221
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
But they encourage us
to keep digging.

1222
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.360
But they encourage us
to keep digging.

1223
01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.040
I asked Savoie about his
relationship with Leithman.

1224
01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.480
Well. he does acknowledge
the relationship

1225
01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.800
with Sidney Leithman.
because that was true.

1226
01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.000
They were strange bedfellows.

1227
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.480
They were strange bedfellows.

1228
01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:28.000
We keep digging and we find out
that Claude Savoie

1229
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:28.320
We keep digging and we find out
that Claude Savoie

1230
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:33.760
meets in a downtown restaurant
with Allan Ross and Sidney Leithman.

1231
01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.000
Then we find out from a source
that right above that restaurant

1232
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.120
Then we find out from a source
that right above that restaurant

1233
01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:44.000
is Sidney Leithman's office
and Claude Savoie meets alone

1234
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:44.200
is Sidney Leithman's office
and Claude Savoie meets alone

1235
01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.760
with Allan Ross.

1236
01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:50.240
I know the guy is not going to
confess to me. there is no way.

1237
01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.000
So I try to find out if he's lying.

1238
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.600
So I try to find out if he's lying.

1239
01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:58.000
if I can prove that he's lying
about something.

1240
01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.000
And I asked him. "How many times
did you meet with Allan Ross?"

1241
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.640
And I asked him. "How many times
did you meet with Allan Ross?"

1242
01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:05.360
and he told me once.

1243
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.000
And I said to him. "Just once?"
and he said. "Yeah. just once."

1244
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:08.880
And I said to him. "Just once?"
and he said. "Yeah. just once."

1245
01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.720
I knew it was two times.

1246
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.720
so he's lying.

1247
01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.000
Why is he lying?
It's a symptom of corruption.

1248
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.920
Why is he lying?
It's a symptom of corruption.

1249
01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.440
The lie is a symptom of corruption.

1250
01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.000
What access to information
that gave Allan Ross!

1251
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.800
What access to information
that gave Allan Ross!

1252
01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.840
That was astounding.

1253
01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.600
I mean. I've seen
lots of corrupt cops

1254
01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.000
in the United States. but I've never
seen anyone at that level.

1255
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.600
in the United States. but I've never
seen anyone at that level.

1256
01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.880
That was something.
That was extraordinary.

1257
01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.320
Allan Ross has a base in Florida.

1258
01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.720
He's got a condo down there.
he's got a yacht.

1259
01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.480
He conducts business
down in Florida.

1260
01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.000
He has to know what the Americans
have on him.

1261
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.840
He has to know what the Americans
have on him.

1262
01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:55.000
But by May 1991.
Sidney Leithman gets whacked.

1263
01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.000
so Allan Ross doesn't have a choice.
He's gotta deal directly

1264
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.440
so Allan Ross doesn't have a choice.
He's gotta deal directly

1265
01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:02.000
with his man inside the RCMP.
Claude Savoie.

1266
01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:04.000
He is Allan Ross's friend
inside law enforcement.

1267
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.240
He is Allan Ross's friend
inside law enforcement.

1268
01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.880
And Savoie calls out of the blue
asking us all these questions.

1269
01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.000
and he's asking questions
he should not be asking.

1270
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.120
and he's asking questions
he should not be asking.

1271
01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.720
He's trying to find out information
on a grand jury indictment

1272
01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.880
which is secret. It is sealed
by a court.

1273
01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:20.000
He was trying to use his status
as a Mountie to get information

1274
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.160
He was trying to use his status
as a Mountie to get information

1275
01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.360
from federal agents in Florida.

1276
01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:32.160
Claude Savoie tells Allan Ross
the Americans are looking for him.

1277
01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:36.000
Yet Ross still goes down to Florida.
Why would he do that?

1278
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:36.840
Yet Ross still goes down to Florida.
Why would he do that?

1279
01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.640
He was arrogant.

1280
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:44.000
He thought he could get away with it
because he had gotten away with it
so many times.

1281
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:44.840
He thought he could get away with it
because he had gotten away with it
so many times.

1282
01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.680
We got our guys in Montreal
watching him to alert us

1283
01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.800
when he actually does come down.

1284
01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.000
And sure enough he came to Florida.
Huge mistake.

1285
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.640
And sure enough he came to Florida.
Huge mistake.

1286
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.000
'This US Marshall shows us how
on October 7th 1991.

1287
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.760
'This US Marshall shows us how
on October 7th 1991.

1288

1289
01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.000
'I came behind him like this
with my gun out here. advising him.

1292
01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:15.640
As we were just about to
the Marshal's office
where I was taking him.

1293
01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.000
he told me or he said to me.
"Well. it would sure be nice

1294
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.400
he told me or he said to me.
"Well. it would sure be nice

1295
01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.800
if I could give you like
$200.000 and you'd let me go."

1296
01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.000
Not that I would. He said it
in a way that I couldn't get him
with bribery.

1297
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.360
Not that I would. He said it
in a way that I couldn't get him
with bribery.

1298
01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:29.120
but I had no doubt if I had said OK.
I'd be $200.000 richer right now.'

1299
01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.000
The trial is one of those
classic scenes.

1300
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.440
The trial is one of those
classic scenes.

1301
01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.880
We're trying him
in a small federal court

1302
01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:40.000
in Gainesville. Florida. We had
looked at Allan Ross's history
of violence

1303
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:40.120
in Gainesville. Florida. We had
looked at Allan Ross's history
of violence

1304
01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:44.240
and we brought in a special team
from the U.S. Marshall service.

1305
01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.280
We've got dogs. dope dogs.
bomb dogs.

1306
01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.000
we've got snipers
on the roof of the courthouse

1307
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.120
we've got snipers
on the roof of the courthouse

1308
01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:55.560
to make sure that he does not
interrupt this trial.

1309
01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.120
When you're in the courthouse
seeing a guy who is responsible

1310
01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.000
for ordering numerous murders
over the years.

1311
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.760
for ordering numerous murders
over the years.

1312
01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.240
you sort of go in there
and you're looking for something.

1313
01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:12.000
something in the man's face
in a way that will reveal

1314
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.760
something in the man's face
in a way that will reveal

1315
01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:18.200
this person
in his full gangster glory

1316
01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.000
and you're always disappointed.

1317
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:20.200
and you're always disappointed.

1318
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.280
There's nothing there.
there's just nothing there.

1319
01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.000
'Ross was found guilty of conspiring
to import and traffic

1322
01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.000
It's Monday. December 21st. 1992.

1323
01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.000
just a few days before Christmas.
there is snow on the ground.

1324
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
just a few days before Christmas.
there is snow on the ground.

1325
01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:58.680
you got Santa Claus
all over the streets.

1326
01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.000
and the lights
and the Christmas trees.

1327
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:00.880
and the lights
and the Christmas trees.

1328
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.560
and two internal investigators
of the RCMP show up

1329
01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.000
at Ottawa headquarters.
They want to speak to Claude Savoie.

1330
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:08.960
at Ottawa headquarters.
They want to speak to Claude Savoie.

1331
01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.320
The RCMP knows we're going to air
on Tuesday. they know

1332
01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.000
what we're investigating
and on Monday morning.
of all the days in the year.

what we're investigating
and on Monday morning.
of all the days in the year.

1334
01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:21.280
of all the time
they are investigating Savoie.

1335
01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.000
they go meet Claude Savoie
on the Monday before we go to air.

1336
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:24.480
they go meet Claude Savoie
on the Monday before we go to air.

1337
01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:31.160
They go into a room and they want
Savoie to come into that room.

1338
01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.000
You know. the room is ready to tape.
video. the whole thing.

1339
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.240
You know. the room is ready to tape.
video. the whole thing.

1340
01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.280
for this interview.

1341
01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.000
Savoie doesn't show up.
They get a little impatient.

1342
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.120
Savoie doesn't show up.
They get a little impatient.

1343
01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:44.760
they walk down to his office.

1344
01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.800
they open the door...

1345
01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.240
.. and they find Savoie
sprawled across his desk
with a bullet in his head.

1346
01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.560
He had shot himself
with his service revolver

1347
01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:56.000
which he had wrapped
in the sleeve of his jacket

1348
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.160
which he had wrapped
in the sleeve of his jacket

1349
01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.440
to muffle the noise.

1350
01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.280
And that was the end of Savoie.

1351
01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:04.000
'Savoie killed himself
shortly before he was supposed
to meet with

1352

1356

an investigative report
on the failures
of the Montreal drug squad.'

1357
01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.000
Wow. That was big news to me.

1358
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.800
Wow. That was big news to me.

1359
01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.080
you know.
It was a hell of a development.

1360
01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:28.000
At The Fifth Estate we had
an expression. "the smoking gun."

1361
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.560
At The Fifth Estate we had
an expression. "the smoking gun."

1362
01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.000
Well. that might have been
the first time ever
we had a literal smoking gun.

1363
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:36.320
Well. that might have been
the first time ever
we had a literal smoking gun.

1364
01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:44.000
For you. his suicide was proof
of Claude Savoie's guilt?

1365
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.680
For you. his suicide was proof
of Claude Savoie's guilt?

1366
01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:51.520
Yeah. without a question. I mean.

1367
01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.000
obviously the guy
couldn't face the music.

1368
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.840
obviously the guy
couldn't face the music.

1369
01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.120
And that's how it ended for him.

1370
01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.000
You don't feel any guilt in that?
We were doing our job

1371
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.680
You don't feel any guilt in that?
We were doing our job

1372
01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:07.440
as reporters. but if you and I
hadn't started the story.

1373
01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:08.000
hadn't investigated the story.
Claude Savoie would be alive.

1374
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.360
hadn't investigated the story.
Claude Savoie would be alive.

1375
01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.520
Do you ever feel any guilt
about that?

1376
01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.000
No. not at all.

1377
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.440
No. not at all.

1378
01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:20.600
It may seem cold-blooded. but...

1379
01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.000
.. yeah. I'd be faking it
if I said I felt bad about it.

1380
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.400
.. yeah. I'd be faking it
if I said I felt bad about it.

1381
01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:32.000
He made his own bed and. you know...
and that's how he decided
to lie in it.

1382
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.280
He made his own bed and. you know...
and that's how he decided
to lie in it.

1383
01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.840
He couldn't face it.
He just couldn't face it. you know?

1384
01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.000
I was shocked at what he did.
His guilt. his guilt.

1385
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.880
I was shocked at what he did.
His guilt. his guilt.

1386
01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.200
Just too much.

1387
01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.000
Did he get money off of Leithman.
did he put other cops' lives

1388
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.080
Did he get money off of Leithman.
did he put other cops' lives

1389
01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.560
in danger? Obviously he did.

1390
01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:56.000
He betrayed me. because I was
a cop and a friend of his.

1391

1396

They were investigating
Claude Savoie. We didn't know that.

1397

They were investigating
Claude Savoie. We didn't know that.

1398
01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.600
And they were closing in on him

1399

about our investigation.

They concluded he had been paid off
over time by the West End Gang

for information.

1417
01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:27.120
The West End Gang felt
they were above the law.

1418
01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:31.000
They were corrupting police.
corrupting lawyers.

1419
01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.000

corrupting the whole system.

And in the process they were
corrupting the whole system.

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.560
The thing with drug organisations.
it's not just the drugs.

1422
01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.000
the major problem is the power
they get from the money.

the major problem is the power
they get from the money.

1424

These people
produced enormous amounts of money.

1425
01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:47.800
Money on this planet is power
and power corrupts.

A lot of the guys
who worked for Dunie Ryan are dead.

really lucky or he felt invincible

It was not worth it."

It was a world that I think a lot of
people got messed up with.

1460
01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.000
Yeah. of course.
A lot of individuals.

1461
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:48.280
Yeah. of course.
A lot of individuals.

1462
01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.640
It's a sad story.
A lot of sad stories.

1463
01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:54.240
You know. it's sad. there are
no more old guys any more.

1464
01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.000
They are mostly all gone.
Most of the guys are gone.

1465
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.840
They are mostly all gone.
Most of the guys are gone.

1466
01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.320
I walked away and never went back.

1467
01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:03.560
I knew that if I ever went back
I would stay there.

1468
01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.880
I became a drug addict.

1469
01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.440
But I might have become
a drug addict anyway.

1470
01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:12.000
It's been a roller-coaster.
my life. But look at me now.

1471
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.920
It's been a roller-coaster.
my life. But look at me now.

1472
01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.160
I could beat the devil.

1473
01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.240
Yeah. I did my bit. and that was
being a responsible journalist.

1474
01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.000
And. uh...

1475
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:28.280
And. uh...

1476
01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:51.560
Looking at it now. I realise
there was so much violence.

1477
01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.000
but I wasn't thinking that
when I was growing up.

1478
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.920
but I wasn't thinking that
when I was growing up.

1479
01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.720
I'm OK.

1480
01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:07.720
Pursuing education
became my ticket out of poverty

1481
01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.000
and then I became a writer
and ended up writing two books

1482
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
and then I became a writer
and ended up writing two books

1483
01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.760
about growing up
in the neighbourhood.

1484
01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:19.160
Some of the gang members found out
about the book

1485
01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.000
and were really upset
and were sending me

1486
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.000
all kinds of threatening emails.
I thought. "Kiss my ass."

1487
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.400
all kinds of threatening emails.
I thought. "Kiss my ass."

1488
01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:45.520
Was it worth it. what I did.
was it really worth it what I did?

1489
01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.000
I don't think so.

1490
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:48.520
I don't think so.

1491
01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.800
It's worth it for some people.
if I succeeded in helping
some people.

1492
01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.000
then that's what the worth
is all about. The rest.
you won't change the system.

1493
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.560
then that's what the worth
is all about. The rest.
you won't change the system.

1494
01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.520
They don't want somebody like me.

1495
01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.000
The system doesn't give a shit
about me. you know.

1496
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.920
The system doesn't give a shit
about me. you know.

1497
01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:09.480
That's what I think.
It doesn't care.

1498
01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.840
When it comes to the underworld.
this is the way the story
always ends.

1499
01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:28.000
all the people are either dead
or in prison.

1500
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:28.800
all the people are either dead
or in prison.

1501
01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:33.440
If there was anything special
about the West End Gang.

1502
01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:36.000
it is the speed at which they rose
and the speed at which they fell.

1503
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:36.960
it is the speed at which they rose
and the speed at which they fell.

1504
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.720
Through their own hubris.
through their own violence.

1505
01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:44.000
they fell just as fast as they rose.

1506
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:44.320
they fell just as fast as they rose.

1507
01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:47.840
And it happened almost overnight
in the annals of crime history.

1508
01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:52.000
The West End Gang thrived
because of powerful leaders

1509
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.400
The West End Gang thrived
because of powerful leaders

1510
01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.840
like Dunie Ryan. Allan Ross.
Gerry Matticks.

1511
01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.000
They needed those kinds of leaders
who had the connections.

1512
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.360
They needed those kinds of leaders
who had the connections.

1513
01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:07.120
the violence. the willingness
to do anything to hold on to power.

1514
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.080
When those leaders were gone.
you still had some Irish gangsters

1515
01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.000
working at the port. but they could
never recapture that old glory.

1516
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:16.520
working at the port. but they could
never recapture that old glory.

1517
01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:26.840
When you have a city that has
a major port.

1518
01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:30.800
you're always going to have
one crime gang
that's gonna rise to the top.

1519
01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.000
It's just a matter of
who's the king.

1520
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.360
It's just a matter of
who's the king.

1521
01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.920
Nobody wins a whole war
in organised crime.

1522
01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.000
There is no winner in that.
Nothing has changed.

1523
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.520
There is no winner in that.
Nothing has changed.

1524
01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.040
Nothing has changed.

1525
01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.840
'Most illegal drugs

1526
01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:48.000
