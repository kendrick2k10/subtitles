00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:47.967
Watch it.

6
00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:49.600
Sorry.

7
00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.200
Good morning Jeff?

8
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.800
All art secure and
accounted for Mrs. Young.

9
00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:45.433
- Great. yours on the corner.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:46.367
See you tomorrow.

11
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.367
See you tomorrow.

12
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.433
- I found him.
- Oh no.

13
00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:53.033
Oh yes.

14
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.233
Please tell me you're not
using that dating app again.

15
00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:55.767
Oh. the one closest to you.

16
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.767
Don't think I peruse that
site for my own benefit.

17
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.266
The one closest to you.

18
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.667
I am a happily married woman

19
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.767
and I'm only
looking out for you.

20
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.967
Frank asked you to stop?

21
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.500
He suggested it and
I did for a while.

22
00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:08.633
but you're not making
any progress on your own.

23
00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:09.934
It's like you're on
the edge of a cliff

24
00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:11.500
and you just need a little push.

25
00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:12.767
But what's in the valley?

26
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.133
A smorgasbord
of available men.

27
00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:18.200
How do I unlock
this? Kate. Kate.

28
00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:19.800
- Hi Lily.
- Hi Kate. this one.

29
00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:21.500
- Oh thank you.
- How do I unlock this?

30
00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:23.467
Oh. you type in the
code or you use your face.

31
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.467
It's not working.

32
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.600
Ah. finally-

33
00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:28.166
Ah. so you have a
call with the mayor at...

34
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.834
Hold that thought. Lily.

35
00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:32.834
You are seriously the
best. Lily. Thank you.

36
00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:34.000
No problem.

37
00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:37.166
Look at him. he makes
kitchens. has no kids.

38
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.433
Any app claiming I'll find
my soulmate is a red flag.

39
00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:41.367
Humor me.

40
00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:44.834
He is handsome.

41
00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:46.300
I knew it.

42
00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:49.700
But really the term
soulmates. it's ridiculous.

43
00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:52.100
Believing there is one
person in the world

44
00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:54.500
out there for you and in
order to be happy and in love.

45
00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:57.000
you have to find that
one person is nonsense.

46
00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:58.800
You're really not interested?

47
00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:02.100
I know you get some sense
of joy in trying to set me up.

48
00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:05.533
It's my mission in life and
it will happen sooner or later.

49
00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:06.433
Preferably sooner.

50
00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:07.700
You're not getting any younger

51
00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:09.400
and pretty soon
your flawless skin

52
00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:10.667
is going to look like mine.

53
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.734
You've gotta strike
while you're hot.

54
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.133
Jamie's swim meet.
did it go well?

55
00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:25.333
Pamela will have my back.

56
00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:28.300
Lily will be much happier
with a man by her side. right?

57
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.800
Thank you.

58
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.166
Look. if there's such
a thing as a soulmate.

59
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.734
mine died years ago.

60
00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:40.033
It's been three years
since Greg passed away.

61
00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:41.700
And how many dates have
you been on since then?

62
00:03:41.834 --> 00:03:43.367
Let me count. One. two. three.

63
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.233
Oh. that's right. Zero.

64
00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:47.600
You will not know until
you try to meet someone.

65
00:03:47.734 --> 00:03:49.600
I'm not looking
for a relationship.

66
00:03:49.734 --> 00:03:51.233
Then start with a simple date.

67
00:03:51.367 --> 00:03:52.834
The next man that comes
through that door.

68
00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:55.300
you are gonna go out
with or you're fired.

69
00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:08.233
Good morning. Peter.

70
00:04:08.367 --> 00:04:10.400
How did Amy's baby shower go?

71
00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:11.633
Oh. it was great.

72
00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:13.467
I can hardly wait to
meet the little guy.

73
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.400
I don't know who's more
excited. her or me.

74
00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:16.300
I bet.

75
00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:17.467
Where do you want these?

76
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.667
There is great.

77
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.033
- Have a good one.
- You too. Thanks Peter.

78
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.667
Okay. the next available man.

79
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.600
This is a nice piece.

80
00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:36.967
Now Lily. you're one
of my best friends.

81
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.734
and I just want you to be happy.

82
00:04:39.867 --> 00:04:41.266
I am happy.

83
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.367
Your version of
happy makes me sad.

84
00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:46.734
You know what you had
with Greg was amazing.

85
00:04:46.867 --> 00:04:48.767
and it can happen again.

86
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.700
I don't know if
I can love again

87
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.767
or even if I want to.

88
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.100
Lily. I know that I'm putting
a lot of pressure on you.

89
00:04:57.233 --> 00:04:59.867
but if you can at least
consider just one.

90
00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:01.834
Is that?

91
00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:04.767
It can't be.

92
00:05:06.967 --> 00:05:08.834
It is definitely you.

93
00:05:08.967 --> 00:05:09.967
It's 100% her.

94
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.700
Where did it come from?

95
00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:14.633
I don't know.

96
00:05:19.533 --> 00:05:20.967
The packing slip is missing.

97
00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:24.700
Who painted it? Is
there a signature?

98
00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:26.000
What about a monogram?

99
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.734
Maybe. a secret admirer.

100
00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:35.200
Oh no. I have to find
out who. Lily this is fate.

101
00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:38.000
Whoever painted this is
the one meant for you.

102
00:05:38.133 --> 00:05:39.567
Assuming the painter is a man.

103
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.934
Oh. let's assume it is a man.

104
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.600
Help me.

105
00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:50.300
Now. no one knows where
the painting came from.

106
00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.500
or who the artist is.
or who donated it.

107
00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:55.700
There's so many
paintings in existence

108
00:05:55.834 --> 00:05:58.333
that the odds of
finding information

109
00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:02.467
about this specific image
can feel insurmountable.

110
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.100
This is what we do. people.

111
00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:06.700
It is of the utmost
importance that we do this.

112
00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:10.767
Well. I don't know about that.

113
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.567
but I have an image recognition
app that we could use.

114
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.800
I can try running a
reverse image search.

115
00:06:17.934 --> 00:06:18.900
If that yields nothing.

116
00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:19.967
we can post it to social media

117
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.266
to see if we can
get any results.

118
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.266
I've started
putting calls into

119
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.800
a few of our expert friends.

120
00:06:23.934 --> 00:06:24.934
Great.

121
00:06:25.066 --> 00:06:26.200
What if the
painting isn't of you?

122
00:06:26.333 --> 00:06:28.667
What if it's a distant
relative or something?

123
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.066
Well. I don't look like
my mother or grandmother.

124
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.900
so it can't be of them.

125
00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:37.066
We can dramatically narrow
down the search by considering

126
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.533
the composition. the
subject matter and style.

127
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.066
It's definitely an original.

128
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.533
there's nothing
of the composition

129
00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:47.967
that signifies any
particular era.

130
00:06:49.233 --> 00:06:51.633
The clothes could be
of any time. period.

131
00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:54.767
Same with the hairstyle.
- How old do you think it is?

132
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.700
Let's see.

133
00:06:58.066 --> 00:07:01.300
So the canvas is stapled
uniformly to the back.

134
00:07:01.433 --> 00:07:04.300
So it can't be made before 1900.

135
00:07:05.567 --> 00:07:06.967
I would say the
painting is newer

136
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.300
because there's no signs
of damage or tearing.

137
00:07:10.433 --> 00:07:12.300
Is it oil or acrylic?

138
00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:13.800
Why would that matter?

139
00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:16.633
Acrylic wasn't used into
art until the 1940s so.

140
00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:18.166
if it's not oil.

141
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.100
then we've a much smaller
period to search through.

142
00:07:46.734 --> 00:07:48.100
We've been looking
for a hidden signature.

143
00:07:48.233 --> 00:07:49.300
You know how artists

144
00:07:49.433 --> 00:07:50.433
have been creative
with that in the past.

145
00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:51.800
we thought we found something.

146
00:07:51.934 --> 00:07:54.467
but then it turned out
to just be some lint.

147
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.834
You're still at the museum?

148
00:07:55.967 --> 00:07:57.333
Oh. the weak have gone home.

149
00:07:57.467 --> 00:07:59.133
But Kate and I are still
burning the midnight oil.

150
00:07:59.266 --> 00:08:00.667
I'm sorry. Kate.

151
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.667
Oh. she's fine.

152
00:08:02.867 --> 00:08:04.767
The painting can't
really be of me.

153
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.767
It has to be of someone
who just looks like me.

154
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.100
What if I have
a doppelgänger?

155
00:08:09.233 --> 00:08:11.533
Oh no. the painting is
definitely of you. Kate.

156
00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:13.700
The likeliness of two
people sharing the exact same

157
00:08:13.834 --> 00:08:17.834
facial features is less
than one in 1 trillion.

158
00:08:17.967 --> 00:08:19.333
Okay.

159
00:08:19.467 --> 00:08:21.700
but we can see two people
who have the same eye color

160
00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:24.700
and same hair color. similar
face shape. and smile.

161
00:08:24.834 --> 00:08:27.000
and we consider them
to be doppelgängers.

162
00:08:27.133 --> 00:08:29.700
why can't that be the case here?

163
00:08:29.834 --> 00:08:31.433
We already went down
that doppelgänger hole.

164
00:08:31.567 --> 00:08:33.934
after you left. painting
has your exact beauty marks

165
00:08:34.066 --> 00:08:35.233
on your cheek. and your chin.

166
00:08:35.367 --> 00:08:38.567
It's not a lookalike. it is you.

167
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.033
Everything
matches perfectly.

168
00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:42.367
Okay. I'm intrigued.

169
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.867
Oh. don't worry my dear.

170
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.367
Before too long.

171
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.867
I will have the name of
your Prince Charming artist.

172
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.133
Good night. Michelle.

173
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.934
13 missed calls.

174
00:08:57.066 --> 00:09:00.133
I'm sorry I turn my ringer
off at night so I can sleep.

175
00:09:00.266 --> 00:09:03.233
I found him well.
Kate did. kind of.

176
00:09:03.367 --> 00:09:06.100
we know where the painting
came from. Ireland.

177
00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:08.633
Ireland.

178
00:09:08.767 --> 00:09:10.166
I don't know anyone in Ireland.

179
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.300
It's a small village
in the Southern part.

180
00:09:12.433 --> 00:09:14.467
And there's no phone
number for the address.

181
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.800
but you can see it
right here on the map.

182
00:09:16.934 --> 00:09:18.500
I knew we weren't gonna
get anywhere quickly

183
00:09:18.633 --> 00:09:19.834
just researching the painting.

184
00:09:19.967 --> 00:09:22.133
we had to focus on where
the painting came from.

185
00:09:22.266 --> 00:09:24.066
So I sent Kate over
to Peter's house

186
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.133
and they found the
packing slip in his truck.

187
00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:27.300
It must have fallen off.

188
00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.266
So now we know where
the painting came from.

189
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.900
Next we'll find out
who sent it and why.

190
00:09:32.033 --> 00:09:33.300
How?

191
00:09:33.433 --> 00:09:35.066
By sending you to Ireland.

192
00:09:36.266 --> 00:09:37.834
Michelle. I can't go.

193
00:09:37.967 --> 00:09:40.100
I have responsibilities
at work and the cost-

194
00:09:40.233 --> 00:09:44.600
Lily. I am your boss and
you are going to Ireland.

195
00:09:44.734 --> 00:09:47.133
Consider it a research trip.

196
00:09:47.266 --> 00:09:49.066
Oh. I simply must know
about this painting.

197
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.166
The artist is extremely talented

198
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.333
and maybe he's done more
paintings and maybe-

199
00:09:54.467 --> 00:09:56.100
Fine. I'll go.

200
00:09:57.934 --> 00:10:01.133
But let's clear something
up before we move forward.

201
00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:03.300
I am only going to
find out who painted it

202
00:10:03.433 --> 00:10:04.734
and why it looks like me.

203
00:10:04.867 --> 00:10:06.066
Good.

204
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.934
Here is your
flight information.

205
00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:12.567
Michelle. you already
bought the tickets?

206
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.233
It is your
destiny to go there.

207
00:10:15.734 --> 00:10:16.867
Okay

208
00:10:22.467 --> 00:10:24.066
How was the flight?

209
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.633
Not bad at all.

210
00:10:25.767 --> 00:10:28.433
I watched "Titanic" and
then slept for a few hours

211
00:10:28.567 --> 00:10:29.967
and then watched "Far and Away".

212
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.667
Fitting for
traveling to Ireland.

213
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.333
So beautiful here.

214
00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:34.967
You call me the
moment you find anything.

215
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.900
I don't care what time
it is here. you call me.

216
00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:39.467
The moment I find anything.

217
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.767
Now I need to focus on driving.

218
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.867
-  Bye.
- Bye

219
00:10:45.433 --> 00:10:46.567
It's the right of the car.

220
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.567
Let's stay to the left.

221
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.100
Turn left onto R700.

222
00:10:57.734 --> 00:10:59.600
You have 10 miles
to your destination.

223
00:11:00.867 --> 00:11:04.700
10 Miles? 10 miles
isn't two kilometers.

224
00:11:04.834 --> 00:11:06.967
You should be in
kilometers anyway.

225
00:11:15.767 --> 00:11:18.900
And how do I change
you to kilometers?

226
00:11:19.033 --> 00:11:19.800
Settings.

227
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.333
American. definitely
an American.

228
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.467
You
have arrived at Inistioge.

229
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.700
county Kilkenny.

230
00:12:52.734 --> 00:12:55.767
Navigate to Inistioge Post.

231
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.033
Head
west to High Street.

232
00:13:15.133 --> 00:13:15.934
Excuse me. Excuse me.

233
00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:19.166
Continue
on High Street for 50 meters.

234
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.166
You nearly killed
me back there.

235
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.600
You need to watch where you're-

236
00:13:26.066 --> 00:13:28.266
I'm sorry. I didn't
hear what you were saying.

237
00:13:29.467 --> 00:13:30.600
Are you all right?

238
00:13:34.133 --> 00:13:35.266
Is this High Street?

239
00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:39.266
That way?

240
00:13:40.633 --> 00:13:42.233
Okay. Thank you.

241
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.800
Your
destination is on your left.

242
00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:56.567
Inistioge Post.

243
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.934
Hello?

244
00:14:09.967 --> 00:14:11.066
Hello.

245
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.066
Hiya. sorry I'll
be right with you.

246
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.166
I just gotta finish this off.

247
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.066
Is this the Inistioge Post?

248
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.333
My navigation has
sent me all over town.

249
00:14:19.467 --> 00:14:21.500
Can't figure out how
addresses work here.

250
00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:23.734
Unfortunately. there's
no official address

251
00:14:23.867 --> 00:14:25.700
for any location in Ireland.

252
00:14:25.834 --> 00:14:28.400
People living on the same
street or even in the same house

253
00:14:28.533 --> 00:14:31.533
may write their addresses
very differently.

254
00:14:31.667 --> 00:14:34.400
in absence of an official
database in Ireland.

255
00:14:34.533 --> 00:14:36.533
we cannot say who
is right or wrong.

256
00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:39.867
So. essentially
everyone is right.

257
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.233
Oh. well I'm here
visiting from the US.

258
00:14:43.367 --> 00:14:45.266
I am a curator for a museum.

259
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.700
I'm trying to track down someone

260
00:14:46.834 --> 00:14:48.567
who sent up a package from here.

261
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.500
Saoirse. Saoirse
you won't believe it.

262
00:14:51.633 --> 00:14:54.066
I could scarcely
believe in myself I-

263
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.700
Hello again.

264
00:14:55.834 --> 00:14:59.333
What's all this about
William? (snaps) William?

265
00:14:59.467 --> 00:15:00.934
Why are you being such a sap?

266
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.433
Hi. sorry. I'm Saoirse.

267
00:15:10.567 --> 00:15:12.900
That's a really pretty
name. I'm Lily Young.

268
00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:14.667
Firm grip.

269
00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:19.166
This idiot is my
brother. William.

270
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.000
Thanks again for
the directions.

271
00:15:22.767 --> 00:15:24.333
William. you're bleeding.

272
00:15:25.767 --> 00:15:28.333
What happened to you? You're
gonna get blood all over.

273
00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:30.667
A car ran me off the
road just outta town.

274
00:15:31.767 --> 00:15:32.900
I think that was me.

275
00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:38.300
I am so sorry. I thought
I heard something.

276
00:15:38.433 --> 00:15:41.233
but then when I looked
there was no one there.

277
00:15:41.367 --> 00:15:44.166
Give us a moment while I
get him a plaster for his cut.

278
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.233
- Okay.
- Okay.

279
00:15:53.133 --> 00:15:54.734
It's her.
- Shh. I know its her.

280
00:15:54.867 --> 00:15:55.967
Don't shout or
she will hear you.

281
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:56.834
I wouldn't believe
it if I wasn't

282
00:15:56.967 --> 00:15:58.233
seeing her with my own eyes.

283
00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:03.066
How is this possible?

284
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.333
I don't know.

285
00:16:04.467 --> 00:16:06.800
Are you gonna say
anything to her?

286
00:16:06.934 --> 00:16:08.467
If I say anything. she
will think I am crazy.

287
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.200
Well. I already
know you're crazy.

288
00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:12.834
We have to find
more about her.

289
00:16:12.967 --> 00:16:14.533
Promise me you won't say
anything to her about it.

290
00:16:14.667 --> 00:16:18.133
I promise. we just need
to ask the right questions.

291
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.967
Here. put one of these on.

292
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.667
Sorry about that.
he's all patched up.

293
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.066
So you were saying something

294
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.533
about someone sending
you a package.

295
00:16:32.667 --> 00:16:34.900
Are you sure your brother's
okay? I feel terrible.

296
00:16:35.033 --> 00:16:36.166
He'll live.

297
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.433
Come let's sit
and have some tea.

298
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.500
American. huh?

299
00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:43.500
Yes. is that a bad thing?

300
00:16:44.633 --> 00:16:47.000
I. just. I...

301
00:16:47.133 --> 00:16:49.667
Yeah. so a museum sent you?

302
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.266
Kind of. my boss at
the museum sent me.

303
00:16:54.834 --> 00:16:57.734
A few days ago. we
received a painting.

304
00:16:57.867 --> 00:17:00.300
a portrait. really. of a woman.

305
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.867
Here I have a picture
of it on my phone.

306
00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:10.367
Now this may seem
a little strange.

307
00:17:14.734 --> 00:17:17.367
Wow. it looks just like you.

308
00:17:18.767 --> 00:17:21.300
As you can imagine. I was
quite surprised when I saw it.

309
00:17:21.433 --> 00:17:24.200
It's not everyday you find
a painting of yourself.

310
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.400
Almost like staring
at yourself in a mirror.

311
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.767
Yes something like that.

312
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.867
And it just turned
up at your museum?

313
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.433
Yes.

314
00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:36.600
We have no idea who painted
it or why it was sent to us.

315
00:17:36.734 --> 00:17:38.800
We don't even know if it was
painted by a man or a woman.

316
00:17:38.934 --> 00:17:40.200
Most definitely a man.

317
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.900
Well. I mean. that's just
what I think. you know.

318
00:17:44.033 --> 00:17:47.200
the way the brush
strokes are. nevermind.

319
00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:52.233
I was hoping you had a
record of the packages sent.

320
00:17:52.367 --> 00:17:54.734
William.
where the devil are you?

321
00:17:55.734 --> 00:17:57.033
Look at the time.

322
00:17:57.166 --> 00:17:58.767
I'm
coming Mr. Gleeson.

323
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.166
It's the rush.
Give us a moment.

324
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.300
Everyone likes to wait to send
their packages just before

325
00:18:03.433 --> 00:18:05.667
the last collection
on half five.

326
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.633
No problem.

327
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.934
Sorry about that.
let's take a look.

328
00:18:31.467 --> 00:18:33.200
Do you have a packing slip?

329
00:18:33.333 --> 00:18:35.900
Yes. a copy of it. here.

330
00:18:39.233 --> 00:18:42.300
Okay. it looks like it was
shipped anytime from a week ago

331
00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:44.533
to a few months ago.

332
00:18:44.667 --> 00:18:46.867
the post can be quite
slow across the ocean.

333
00:18:47.834 --> 00:18:49.200
No computer records.

334
00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:50.667
Not here.

335
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.000
Everything goes to Dublin and
their computers take over.

336
00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:56.667
So you write everything by
hand that gets sent from here?

337
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.700
It's the way our parents did
it. and theirs before them.

338
00:18:59.834 --> 00:19:02.166
The ownership of the Post
stretches back four generations.

339
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.200
And it just goes to show that
while some things may change.

340
00:19:04.333 --> 00:19:06.533
like patterns of employment
or how people shop.

341
00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:09.066
the essentials of
human life do not.

342
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.166
Found it. five weeks
ago sent by a J. O'Brien.

343
00:19:14.967 --> 00:19:16.400
There's the signature.

344
00:19:16.533 --> 00:19:18.233
J. O'Brien.

345
00:19:18.367 --> 00:19:21.000
What day of the week
was this? Thursday.

346
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.600
Which means you were
out making deliveries

347
00:19:23.734 --> 00:19:26.000
while I was manning the Post.

348
00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:27.934
I don't remember any
O'Briens coming in.

349
00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:29.567
let alone a J. O'Brien.

350
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.667
That's okay. this has
been so helpful. Thank you.

351
00:19:33.633 --> 00:19:35.066
You're leaving?

352
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.934
I've already taken
up so much of your time

353
00:19:37.066 --> 00:19:39.066
and you're probably
about to close.

354
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.934
Why don't you
join us for supper?

355
00:19:42.367 --> 00:19:45.667
We can think of some more
O'Briens in the area for you.

356
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.567
Really?

357
00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:50.300
That'd be great.

358
00:19:56.133 --> 00:19:59.033
So this place is the post
office and your home?

359
00:19:59.166 --> 00:20:01.266
Mm hmm. My whole life.

360
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.467
Our family has owned
this post since 1918.

361
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.834
just as World War I
was coming to an end.

362
00:20:06.967 --> 00:20:08.200
I love this building.

363
00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:11.233
Part of it dates back to 1663.

364
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.633
It's just the two of you?

365
00:20:14.767 --> 00:20:19.467
Yeah. both single and both
here for our entire lives.

366
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.667
I still sleep in the small
bedroom I was born in.

367
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.633
That's amazing.

368
00:20:24.767 --> 00:20:27.800
Well. most people might
disagree. but I love it.

369
00:20:29.433 --> 00:20:32.467
So is this your first
time in Ireland?

370
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.100
Yes. and hopefully
not my last.

371
00:20:35.233 --> 00:20:37.800
although. I don't think
I'll be doing much driving.

372
00:20:37.934 --> 00:20:39.934
I don't wanna run anyone
else the road again.

373
00:20:41.266 --> 00:20:43.300
No relatives from
here or anything?

374
00:20:43.433 --> 00:20:44.400
Not that I know of.

375
00:20:45.834 --> 00:20:48.567
Didn't fancy bringing along
a special someone either?

376
00:20:50.066 --> 00:20:51.567
I'm not in a relationship.

377
00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:18.000
So she's single and
I happened to mention

378
00:21:18.133 --> 00:21:19.000
that you were too.

379
00:21:20.667 --> 00:21:21.934
You see. It's her.

380
00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.467
Wow. I don't disagree.

381
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.600
I can't believe it.
I thought it was crazy.

382
00:21:30.734 --> 00:21:32.100
Mom and Dad definitely
thought I was.

383
00:21:32.233 --> 00:21:34.867
You've had the image of this
woman in your head since you

384
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.834
were a lad and now she's
standing in the other room.

385
00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:43.033
I put her out of my mind
though. how long has it been?

386
00:21:43.166 --> 00:21:44.400
Five years ago. I threw
that painting away

387
00:21:44.533 --> 00:21:46.100
and hadn't thought of it since.

388
00:21:48.333 --> 00:21:49.533
Was it you?

389
00:21:49.667 --> 00:21:52.533
- Was it me what?
- Did you send it?

390
00:21:52.667 --> 00:21:55.867
No. but I do admit that
I got it out of the rubbish

391
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.266
and donated it to.

392
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.266
oh. I can't remember where.
it was five years ago.

393
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.567
Okay well. how did
it end up in America

394
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.000
and specifically the
museum where Lily works?

395
00:22:05.133 --> 00:22:06.300
Destiny.

396
00:22:06.433 --> 00:22:10.333
Destiny. what if she
turns out to be crazy?

397
00:22:10.467 --> 00:22:12.834
She seems pleasant to me.

398
00:22:12.967 --> 00:22:14.300
Or if she thinks I'm crazy?

399
00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:16.934
I wouldn't blame her with
how you've been acting.

400
00:22:17.066 --> 00:22:20.767
The ownership of the Post
stretches back four generations.

401
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.133
I've never
seen you so nervous.

402
00:22:23.266 --> 00:22:25.934
It's like. you don't know
what to say or how to act.

403
00:22:26.066 --> 00:22:27.967
Do you think she knows?

404
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.567
Don't worry. you can be
your charming self at dinner.

405
00:22:34.233 --> 00:22:36.000
This is delicious.

406
00:22:36.133 --> 00:22:37.767
It's our mom's recipe.
Saoirse's favorite.

407
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.233
Yeah. but we're here to talk
about O'Briens. not my cakes.

408
00:22:42.367 --> 00:22:44.767
How many O'Briens
are in the area?

409
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.000
O'Brien would be

410
00:22:46.133 --> 00:22:47.667
one of the most common
surnames in Ireland.

411
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.934
There has to be dozens
and dozens of J. O'Briens.

412
00:22:51.066 --> 00:22:53.266
We even have some more
O'Brien relatives.

413
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.667
I went to a school
with a Jimmy O'Brien.

414
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.066
Saoirse even went out
with him one once.

415
00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.166
Once was more than enough.

416
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.500
He used to copy my schoolwork.

417
00:23:01.633 --> 00:23:04.133
Do you think he could
have sent the painting?

418
00:23:04.266 --> 00:23:05.100
Doubtful?

419
00:23:06.266 --> 00:23:08.367
What are you gonna
do when you find him?

420
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.433
The J. O'Brien who
sent the painting.

421
00:23:11.467 --> 00:23:12.767
Ask him why he sent it.

422
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.433
And what about who painted it?

423
00:23:16.333 --> 00:23:17.800
That would be the next step.

424
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.033
I didn't realize how late it
was. I should get to my hotel.

425
00:23:23.166 --> 00:23:24.500
Oh no. no. we can
take care of those.

426
00:23:24.633 --> 00:23:26.133
Yeah.

427
00:23:26.266 --> 00:23:27.266
Thanks.

428
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.200
Thank you so much for
helping and for dinner.

429
00:23:31.333 --> 00:23:33.400
We're glad to share a
table and help when we can.

430
00:23:33.533 --> 00:23:35.567
Plus this J. O'Brien mystery has

431
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.834
brought a bit of
excitement into our lives.

432
00:23:37.967 --> 00:23:40.133
Me too. Okay goodnight.

433
00:23:41.333 --> 00:23:44.333
Wait. let's all
get a photo together

434
00:23:44.467 --> 00:23:46.500
with our new American friend.

435
00:23:46.633 --> 00:23:47.567
Okay.

436
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.433
Okay. all together.

437
00:23:52.133 --> 00:23:54.400
Great. Perfect.

438
00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:57.700
Why don't you type in your
number and I'll send it to you?

439
00:23:57.834 --> 00:23:58.633
Sure.

440
00:24:00.934 --> 00:24:04.200
Here you go. Have a good night.

441
00:24:04.333 --> 00:24:05.166
- Good night.
- Good night.

442
00:24:17.834 --> 00:24:18.700
Pathetic.

443
00:24:19.867 --> 00:24:20.900
Ow!

444
00:24:21.033 --> 00:24:22.433
Are you just
gonna let her leave?

445
00:24:22.567 --> 00:24:23.800
What am I supposed to do?

446
00:24:23.934 --> 00:24:25.567
Run after and tell her I
used to dream about her

447
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.066
and that I was the
one that painted her?

448
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.567
Honesty is always
a good start.

449
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.867
That'd be too honest.

450
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.233
Well. all hope is not lost

451
00:24:35.367 --> 00:24:38.000
because I was smart enough
to get her phone number.

452
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.567
Excuse me.

453
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.300
That was fast.

454
00:25:08.433 --> 00:25:09.533
You have the name
of the painter?

455
00:25:09.667 --> 00:25:11.133
No. but I have the
name of the person

456
00:25:11.266 --> 00:25:12.667
who sent the painting.

457
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.333
The brother and sister
at this post office

458
00:25:14.467 --> 00:25:15.700
were very helpful.

459
00:25:15.834 --> 00:25:16.834
Tell me. tell me. tell me.

460
00:25:16.967 --> 00:25:19.934
It was sent by a J. O'Brien.

461
00:25:20.066 --> 00:25:22.967
Lily O'Brien. not
quite what I imagined.

462
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.133
but I can live with it.
- I'm hanging up.

463
00:25:25.266 --> 00:25:26.867
No. no. no. wait.
where are you staying?

464
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.467
I'm about to try to find
the place now. I better go.

465
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.900
Bye.
- Bye.

466
00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:36.533
All right. staff meeting
Pronto. I have updates.

467
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.467
Navigate to Ballyduff house.

468
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.800
You have 15 kilometers

469
00:25:41.934 --> 00:25:43.300
until your destination.

470
00:25:43.433 --> 00:25:45.133
At least you
speak in kilometers.

471
00:25:58.934 --> 00:26:00.734
You gotta be kidding me.

472
00:26:05.333 --> 00:26:07.333
Our rental
office is currently closed.

473
00:26:07.467 --> 00:26:09.033
Please call back in the morning.

474
00:26:12.633 --> 00:26:15.800
O'Brien's repair
shop. O'Brien's.

475
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.133
O'Brien's Repairs.

476
00:26:30.233 --> 00:26:31.033
Hello?

477
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.367
Hi. is this your shop?

478
00:26:38.333 --> 00:26:40.800
Eamon. Eamon. Eamon!

479
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.700
What's all the
excitement about Garret?

480
00:26:44.834 --> 00:26:45.867
Can you see her too?

481
00:26:47.333 --> 00:26:48.667
She is the prettiest
thing that has ever walked

482
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.066
through our doors.

483
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.633
You must forgive my
brother he speaks his mind.

484
00:26:53.533 --> 00:26:55.200
You're both O'Briens?

485
00:26:55.333 --> 00:26:57.200
I'm Eamon O'Brien.
this is Garret.

486
00:26:58.133 --> 00:26:59.767
My car won't start.

487
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.100
I was hoping your repairs
included vehicles.

488
00:27:02.233 --> 00:27:05.133
Unfortunately no. that's
beyond my skill set.

489
00:27:05.266 --> 00:27:08.266
You want to talk to Gerald
Doyle. he's down at the pub.

490
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.767
He won't be any good to you
till about mid-day tomorrow.

491
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.934
but if you have a toaster
vacuum or smaller appliance.

492
00:27:13.066 --> 00:27:14.200
we can be of service.

493
00:27:16.967 --> 00:27:18.367
What about a bike?

494
00:27:27.066 --> 00:27:28.934
Is Janah O'Brien
still an O'Brien

495
00:27:29.066 --> 00:27:30.600
or did she get remarried?

496
00:27:30.734 --> 00:27:33.333
She's Janah Collins now. but
a different Collins this time

497
00:27:33.467 --> 00:27:35.266
married to Rory. not Ronan.

498
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.467
Ronan was her second marriage.

499
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.700
Why do you ask?

500
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.266
Using the records
from the Post

501
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.900
I can put together a list of
every J. O'Brien in the area.

502
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.567
Ooh.

503
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.033
And who might this list be for?

504
00:27:51.433 --> 00:27:53.133
Like you said. I just can't
let her go without trying.

505
00:27:53.266 --> 00:27:54.667
It's about time
you started listening

506
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.767
to the wise counsel
of your sister.

507
00:27:58.934 --> 00:28:01.467
Should I put Janah
on the list then?

508
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.166
Yeah. she may have
signed under J. O'Brien.

509
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.467
Better keep her on there.

510
00:28:05.633 --> 00:28:06.734
Hey. did you see
Mrs. O'Cleary yesterday?

511
00:28:06.867 --> 00:28:07.900
I don't think so.

512
00:28:08.934 --> 00:28:10.433
She didn't pick up her paper.

513
00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.633
Well. I have some
deliveries to make.

514
00:28:14.767 --> 00:28:16.900
What? I thought
your bike was broken.

515
00:28:17.033 --> 00:28:20.066
So it is. Better see
if I can get it fixed.

516
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.867
Could I borrow your car?

517
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.033
Yeah.

518
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.266
How are you. William?

519
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.500
Tell me you didn't sleep
in your car last night.

520
00:29:16.367 --> 00:29:17.867
I did.

521
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.600
Why didn't you
come ask for help?

522
00:29:19.734 --> 00:29:22.200
Because I had already
taken so much of your day.

523
00:29:23.567 --> 00:29:26.000
Well. I'm making breakfast.
You should join us.

524
00:29:27.433 --> 00:29:28.734
Okay.

525
00:29:28.867 --> 00:29:29.667
Thank you.

526
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.834
It's amazing.
- Really?

527
00:29:41.767 --> 00:29:42.700
Back already?

528
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.400
Did you fix my bike?

529
00:29:45.533 --> 00:29:47.567
Wasn't me. No. why?

530
00:29:49.033 --> 00:29:49.734
It was you?

531
00:29:50.834 --> 00:29:52.300
I hope that's okay.

532
00:29:52.433 --> 00:29:54.967
I was the one responsible
for the damage.

533
00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.533
Did it ride okay?

534
00:29:56.667 --> 00:29:59.400
Better than ever
actually. Thank you.

535
00:29:59.533 --> 00:30:01.967
I found O'Brien's
repair shop last night.

536
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.400
Eoman fixed it right up.

537
00:30:03.533 --> 00:30:05.300
And then she slept in her car.

538
00:30:06.333 --> 00:30:07.200
Your car?

539
00:30:07.333 --> 00:30:08.633
It wouldn't start.

540
00:30:08.767 --> 00:30:12.100
but the rental company is
coming to swap out cars today.

541
00:30:12.233 --> 00:30:14.266
We could have helped.

542
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.066
Eamon and Garret
O'Brien were very helpful.

543
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.900
Garret even proposed.

544
00:30:19.033 --> 00:30:22.400
I think. unfortunately they
didn't know any O'Briens

545
00:30:22.533 --> 00:30:24.000
that started with the letter J.

546
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.233
I think we can
help you with that.

547
00:30:28.367 --> 00:30:29.700
Using the records of
the Post I put together

548
00:30:29.834 --> 00:30:32.734
a list of every J. O'Brien
in a 100 kilometer radius.

549
00:30:32.867 --> 00:30:35.533
That far?

550
00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:37.433
Thank you. William.

551
00:30:37.567 --> 00:30:39.600
Now where's the map?

552
00:30:39.734 --> 00:30:41.133
Looking at the area this way.

553
00:30:41.266 --> 00:30:43.300
I don't see anyone coming from
outside of here to our Post

554
00:30:43.433 --> 00:30:44.567
to send a package.

555
00:30:45.867 --> 00:30:47.033
How many does that leave.

556
00:30:47.166 --> 00:30:49.367
if you take those
farther ones off?

557
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.333
27.

558
00:30:52.333 --> 00:30:53.934
This is gonna take a while.

559
00:30:54.066 --> 00:30:56.033
We told you O'Brien's
a very common name.

560
00:30:56.166 --> 00:30:57.600
- Yeah.
- You know.

561
00:30:57.734 --> 00:31:00.100
instead of sending you
out with a list of names

562
00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:03.600
and addresses in a country
you've never been in before.

563
00:31:03.734 --> 00:31:05.600
let us help you.

564
00:31:05.734 --> 00:31:07.500
You've already done so much.

565
00:31:07.633 --> 00:31:08.967
I'm sure with your job.

566
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.367
you're really good at
organizing and cataloging.

567
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.633
William is really good
at reading a map

568
00:31:14.767 --> 00:31:17.100
and knowing the area
and traveling about.

569
00:31:17.233 --> 00:31:19.200
and I have a car that runs.

570
00:31:20.233 --> 00:31:22.266
What if we work together
to try and figure out

571
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.133
who sent the painting and why?

572
00:31:24.266 --> 00:31:25.333
Are you sure
it's not a bother?

573
00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:27.033
I don't wanna take you
away from your work.

574
00:31:27.166 --> 00:31:29.033
No. we can make
deliveries as we go.

575
00:31:29.166 --> 00:31:30.500
Right. William?

576
00:31:30.633 --> 00:31:31.934
Right.

577
00:31:32.066 --> 00:31:34.200
Great. That's settled.

578
00:31:34.333 --> 00:31:35.667
We can start now.

579
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.734
It'll be like taking
a little holiday.

580
00:31:53.066 --> 00:31:54.000
I know you're
eager to help Lily.

581
00:31:54.133 --> 00:31:55.700
but doesn't this just seem like

582
00:31:55.834 --> 00:31:57.367
we're leading her on
a wild goose chase?

583
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.066
She wants to know how the
painting made it to America.

584
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.266
and so do we. unless
you wanna tell her.

585
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.500
Oh. no.

586
00:32:04.633 --> 00:32:06.033
At least this way.

587
00:32:06.166 --> 00:32:08.867
you'll get to spend more time
with her and get to know her.

588
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:09.834
Here she comes.

589
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.567
Sorry. I just had to leave
the keys for rental company.

590
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.533
Let's crack on.

591
00:32:18.333 --> 00:32:20.033
That's not my side.

592
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.066
This is so exciting.

593
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.200
I feel like I did When I
used to bunk off school.

594
00:32:34.333 --> 00:32:35.333
Eyes on the road.

595
00:32:40.133 --> 00:32:42.600
You said O'Brien was a
common name. How common?

596
00:32:43.834 --> 00:32:45.166
You can find out
O'Briens all over.

597
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.066
In county's Clare. Limerick.
Tipperary and Waterford.

598
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.600
It's good thing we have
the spelling of O Brien.

599
00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:53.800
because you can also spell
it B-R-I-A-N or B-R-Y-A-N.

600
00:32:54.967 --> 00:32:56.300
The list would have
been a lot longer.

601
00:33:05.734 --> 00:33:08.667
What does O' mean
in Irish surnames?

602
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.934
Grandson of. or descendant of.

603
00:33:11.066 --> 00:33:12.333
And what about Mac?

604
00:33:12.467 --> 00:33:13.266
Son of.

605
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.667
I just realized. I don't even
know what your last name is.

606
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.300
It's not O'Brien is it?

607
00:33:19.433 --> 00:33:21.166
No. Murphy?

608
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.233
That sounds like
a good. strong name.

609
00:33:24.367 --> 00:33:25.633
Who lives here?

610
00:33:25.767 --> 00:33:28.600
Our distant aunt and
uncle on our mum's side.

611
00:33:28.734 --> 00:33:31.100
I'm not really sure how
they're related exactly.

612
00:33:31.233 --> 00:33:32.934
But we see them at
family gatherings.

613
00:33:33.066 --> 00:33:34.800
And their last
name is O'Brien.

614
00:33:34.934 --> 00:33:37.166
Aunt Deirdre married
an O'Brien. got divorced.

615
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.133
but kept the name. made
her new husband Liam

616
00:33:39.266 --> 00:33:40.834
take the name as well.

617
00:33:40.967 --> 00:33:42.333
I hope she isn't home.

618
00:33:42.467 --> 00:33:43.934
You know how most
families have a.

619
00:33:44.066 --> 00:33:46.166
an eccentric aunt or
uncle who enjoys the drink?

620
00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.800
Deirdre asks
totally inappropriate

621
00:33:48.934 --> 00:33:50.633
and infuriating questions.

622
00:33:50.767 --> 00:33:52.467
Mostly about my relationships

623
00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.800
or all those things I would
rather not talk about.

624
00:33:55.934 --> 00:33:57.133
All right. here we go.

625
00:33:57.266 --> 00:33:58.834
I really hope it's Liam.

626
00:33:58.967 --> 00:34:01.900
I don't think I can
handle. Deirdre right now.

627
00:34:02.033 --> 00:34:04.266
Please be Liam. Please be Liam.

628
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.133
Hi. Aunt Deirdre

629
00:34:08.266 --> 00:34:09.066
Hi. William.

630
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.700
How's the form?
You're looking well.

631
00:34:11.834 --> 00:34:13.000
It's a grand
old day. Isn't it?

632
00:34:13.133 --> 00:34:14.867
Where is Liam?

633
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
I give him a bag of Skittles
and three bottles of Coke

634
00:34:17.133 --> 00:34:20.000
about an hour ago he's been
up to high doh ever since.

635
00:34:21.266 --> 00:34:24.367
Hey Saoirse. how you getting on?

636
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.700
Not married yet?

637
00:34:25.834 --> 00:34:27.700
Making anything of yourself?

638
00:34:27.834 --> 00:34:29.333
Oh. look at the time.

639
00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:32.200
I best get going. I'll
chat to you later. Yeah.

640
00:34:32.333 --> 00:34:34.800
Hi Deirdre. I'm Lily.

641
00:34:34.934 --> 00:34:36.233
This is our
friend from America.

642
00:34:36.367 --> 00:34:39.667
Another Yank. hadn't got
enough from the last one. huh?

643
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.667
Yeah. May we come in?

644
00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.266
Oh yeah. of course. come in.

645
00:34:45.266 --> 00:34:46.667
How many O'Briens
are on that list?

646
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.200
I have two pages full.

647
00:34:48.333 --> 00:34:50.300
but we were hoping to cut
that down with your help.

648
00:34:50.433 --> 00:34:53.734
You still lobbin' the gob
with that fell from Dublin?

649
00:34:53.867 --> 00:34:55.000
He was a cute hoor. that fellow.

650
00:34:55.133 --> 00:34:56.567
always managed to
get free tickets

651
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.033
for the concerts in
the Phoenix Park.

652
00:34:58.166 --> 00:34:59.867
Do you think
you could help us?

653
00:35:00.066 --> 00:35:01.066
I'll give it a lash.

654
00:35:04.867 --> 00:35:05.700
Here we go.

655
00:35:09.433 --> 00:35:12.033
James. I haven't seen
James in donkey's years.

656
00:35:12.166 --> 00:35:13.433
Is he still at the same place?

657
00:35:13.567 --> 00:35:16.100
No. Moved up north
about a year ago.

658
00:35:16.233 --> 00:35:17.734
Cross him off.

659
00:35:17.867 --> 00:35:22.867
Judi. she died last spring
and poor Jacob. poor fellow.

660
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.900
He's been knocking on
death's door for months now.

661
00:35:27.066 --> 00:35:28.266
Jagat O'Brien. huh?

662
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.800
He was here last night
acting the maggot.

663
00:35:30.934 --> 00:35:33.533
His mom's been up to 90 since
she came home and found out

664
00:35:33.667 --> 00:35:36.066
what that dog did on the
sofa in the living room.

665
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.367
Jannon. still on the farm.

666
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.266
You can cross him off the list.

667
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.033
He can't even
write his own name.

668
00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.767
You better hurry up
and find yourself a man

669
00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.934
and start having babies.

670
00:35:49.066 --> 00:35:53.266
Those birthing hips are
primed and ready.

671
00:36:00.467 --> 00:36:01.700
Thank you for your help.

672
00:36:01.834 --> 00:36:03.867
Don't worry about
it. You're grand.

673
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.367
- Okay. Bye now.

674
00:36:07.133 --> 00:36:07.934
- Bye.
- Bye now.

675
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.533
Primed and ready.

676
00:36:27.667 --> 00:36:28.500
It was worth it.
we were able to cross

677
00:36:28.633 --> 00:36:29.967
six names off the list.

678
00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.000
I didn't know what she
was saying half the time.

679
00:36:31.133 --> 00:36:32.934
What is lob the glob?

680
00:36:33.066 --> 00:36:36.500
It's lob the gob. kissing.

681
00:36:36.633 --> 00:36:37.667
Ah.

682
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.166
Well Jimmy's
closest on the list.

683
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.667
Should we try him this
afternoon. after some lunch?

684
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.533
These primed and ready hips
need to get back to the Post.

685
00:36:44.667 --> 00:36:47.000
Apparently I need to
either get married

686
00:36:47.133 --> 00:36:50.266
or figure out how to
make something of myself.

687
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.333
Why don't you two grab
some lunch at the cafe

688
00:36:52.467 --> 00:36:53.800
and head to Jimmy's after.

689
00:36:53.934 --> 00:36:56.033
What so I have to
face Jimmy without you?

690
00:36:56.166 --> 00:36:59.166
There's only so much crazy
I can handle in one day.

691
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.467
Plus Lily'll be with you.

692
00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:09.100
-like it at the Post?
-So howe

693
00:37:09.233 --> 00:37:10.800
The Post is part
of who we are.

694
00:37:12.433 --> 00:37:14.467
Have you ever thought of
leaving the Post behind?

695
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.800
Either of you?

696
00:37:15.934 --> 00:37:16.967
Don't tell Saoirse this.

697
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.200
but I have thought
about leaving before.

698
00:37:18.333 --> 00:37:19.700
Really?

699
00:37:19.834 --> 00:37:21.133
I don't now how Saoirse
would handle it though.

700
00:37:21.266 --> 00:37:22.533
Couple years ago.

701
00:37:22.667 --> 00:37:24.100
we tried to take a holiday
and hire a postman.

702
00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.767
It was an absolute disaster.

703
00:37:27.433 --> 00:37:30.133
I mean. if I left now. that's
just a lot to put on Saoirse.

704
00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:35.033
I'm sure she could
come up with a solution.

705
00:37:35.166 --> 00:37:36.166
But then she
would be stuck here.

706
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.934
And I don't think we could.

707
00:37:38.066 --> 00:37:41.300
it's our family. our home.
our legacy. I suppose.

708
00:37:41.667 --> 00:37:42.800
That is a nice legacy.

709
00:37:44.734 --> 00:37:46.433
You ready to go see Jimmy now?

710
00:37:46.567 --> 00:37:47.700
Yes.

711
00:37:47.834 --> 00:37:49.667
We could walk if you
want. it's not far.

712
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.066
That would be grand.

713
00:37:55.633 --> 00:37:58.000
So you've really lived
here your whole life.

714
00:37:58.133 --> 00:37:59.867
I almost got away for school.

715
00:38:00.066 --> 00:38:01.433
planned on going to Limerick.

716
00:38:03.233 --> 00:38:04.567
What happened?

717
00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.834
Mom took ill and I needed to
stay and help with the Post.

718
00:38:07.967 --> 00:38:09.266
That was kind of you.

719
00:38:10.166 --> 00:38:11.266
My dad took care of her.

720
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.000
until his health
started to decline.

721
00:38:14.367 --> 00:38:16.500
They were childhood sweethearts

722
00:38:16.633 --> 00:38:20.500
who were inseparable during
the 47 years of marriage.

723
00:38:20.633 --> 00:38:23.333
They passed while holding
hands in the hospital.

724
00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:24.667
Saoirse and I were there.

725
00:38:24.967 --> 00:38:26.600
My mom passed first.

726
00:38:27.233 --> 00:38:29.667
Saoirse put my mom's
head on my dad's shoulder

727
00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.367
and told my dad
that he could go.

728
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.367
that my mom was waiting for him.

729
00:38:35.133 --> 00:38:36.700
within minutes he was gone.

730
00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:41.233
Sorry for the sad story.

731
00:38:41.367 --> 00:38:42.800
No. it's a beautiful story.

732
00:38:44.667 --> 00:38:45.834
Thank you for telling me.

733
00:38:47.567 --> 00:38:50.300
So was it love at
first sight for them?

734
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.900
For my dad. for my
mom on the other hand.

735
00:38:55.033 --> 00:38:57.800
it took quite a bit of chivalry
from my dad to win her over.

736
00:38:59.066 --> 00:39:01.066
That sounds like how
it was for me and Greg.

737
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.633
We met our first
year in high school.

738
00:39:02.767 --> 00:39:05.400
but I wouldn't go out with
him until we were seniors.

739
00:39:05.533 --> 00:39:06.266
Greg.

740
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.433
My husband. he passed
away a few years ago.

741
00:39:12.967 --> 00:39:16.600
Sorry. Was he your
one and only?

742
00:39:18.467 --> 00:39:21.000
I loved Greg
and we were happy.

743
00:39:21.133 --> 00:39:24.767
but I think that sometimes
we're led to believe

744
00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.266
that there is a one
and only out there.

745
00:39:29.734 --> 00:39:30.934
You don't believe in fate?

746
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.100
I don't think so.

747
00:39:33.233 --> 00:39:34.000
Why not?

748
00:39:36.133 --> 00:39:37.467
Because I think if
there was such a thing.

749
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.934
it left me alone when Greg died.

750
00:39:42.233 --> 00:39:43.367
I'm sorry about Greg.

751
00:39:44.266 --> 00:39:45.066
It's okay.

752
00:39:46.133 --> 00:39:46.934
Here we are.

753
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.100
I'm short of the
coin this morning.

754
00:39:51.233 --> 00:39:53.300
Tom left again without
buying his round.

755
00:39:53.433 --> 00:39:55.433
Fella could peel an
orange in his pocket.

756
00:39:56.467 --> 00:39:58.834
Jimmy. It's me. William.

757
00:39:58.967 --> 00:40:00.333
William.

758
00:40:00.467 --> 00:40:03.667
William Murphy I thought
you were someone else.

759
00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.934
How's that sister
of yours doing?

760
00:40:05.066 --> 00:40:06.533
Is she still asking for me?

761
00:40:10.233 --> 00:40:12.100
How are you doing? Hi!

762
00:40:12.233 --> 00:40:14.166
Hi Jimmy. I'm Lily.

763
00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.467
I bet you are.

764
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.934
This is our
friend from America.

765
00:40:17.066 --> 00:40:19.567
America. another one?

766
00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.333
So Jimmy. you didn't
happen to send a package

767
00:40:21.467 --> 00:40:22.967
to America from the
Post a while back?

768
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.467
Package to America?

769
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:28.433
We received a package to the
museum I work at in the US.

770
00:40:28.567 --> 00:40:30.333
It was sent by a J. O'Brien.

771
00:40:30.467 --> 00:40:33.066
Ah. see we O'Brien's
are a lucky bunch.

772
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.967
You know we're descended
from some of the most famous

773
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.633
and greatest Irish kings.

774
00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.333
So I've heard.

775
00:40:38.467 --> 00:40:41.133
Jimmy. Okay. so what do
you say about the package?

776
00:40:41.266 --> 00:40:43.900
So why would I send
a package to America?

777
00:40:44.033 --> 00:40:45.133
That answers our question.

778
00:40:45.266 --> 00:40:46.767
Well. thanks Jimmy.
We'll be on our way.

779
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.367
Are you leaving so soon?

780
00:40:49.433 --> 00:40:50.600
Tell Saoirse to call me.

781
00:40:54.133 --> 00:40:57.000
Thank you for today.
it was an adventure.

782
00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.467
Isn't this the same car?

783
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.400
Yes. but the
rental car company

784
00:41:02.533 --> 00:41:04.200
said that they swapped
out the battery.

785
00:41:04.333 --> 00:41:05.233
It should work now.

786
00:41:07.433 --> 00:41:10.834
So it's 15 kilometers
to Ballyduff House?

787
00:41:10.967 --> 00:41:12.967
Yeah. it takes about
an hour to get there.

788
00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:16.300
It takes an hour
to get 15 kilometers?

789
00:41:16.433 --> 00:41:17.166
Is that where you're staying?

790
00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.333
Yes. beats sleeping in my car.

791
00:41:19.467 --> 00:41:23.300
Or you could stay with us.
We have an empty guest room.

792
00:41:23.433 --> 00:41:24.500
The sheets are clean.

793
00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.133
The alternative is
you drive around

794
00:41:27.266 --> 00:41:29.033
trying to find Ballyduff House.

795
00:41:29.166 --> 00:41:30.834
It'll be dark before
you get there.

796
00:41:30.967 --> 00:41:33.633
Well. I don't like
the idea of driving.

797
00:41:33.767 --> 00:41:34.967
let alone at night.

798
00:41:36.133 --> 00:41:38.734
Okay. As long as you
let me pay for the room.

799
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.467
We are down to 20.

800
00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.633
We still have
a J. O'Brien to find.

801
00:41:46.767 --> 00:41:48.967
Tomorrow it's just gonna
have to be the two of you.

802
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.200
Somebody has to
stay here all day.

803
00:41:51.333 --> 00:41:52.900
Is that okay with you. Lily?

804
00:41:53.033 --> 00:41:54.133
Yeah. no problem.

805
00:41:54.266 --> 00:41:55.467
We got along swell today.

806
00:42:06.533 --> 00:42:08.066
Did you see Mrs.
O'Cleary today?

807
00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.633
No. I didn't see her.

808
00:42:09.767 --> 00:42:11.734
She's missed the paper
two days in a row now.

809
00:42:11.867 --> 00:42:13.400
I'm sure she's fine.

810
00:42:13.533 --> 00:42:15.200
I'll go check on
her in the morning.

811
00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.567
Got along swell
today. did you?

812
00:42:19.767 --> 00:42:20.900
I was finally
able to be myself

813
00:42:21.033 --> 00:42:23.800
and not act so uncomfortable.

814
00:42:23.934 --> 00:42:26.233
Thank goodness for that.

815
00:42:26.367 --> 00:42:29.200
Being around her feels
like it did in my dreams.

816
00:42:29.333 --> 00:42:30.133
How's that?

817
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:31.967
Familiar.

818
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.567
Good. because I like her.

819
00:42:35.834 --> 00:42:37.233
Just keep at it.

820
00:42:37.367 --> 00:42:39.133
And if it's meant
to be it'll happen.

821
00:42:59.233 --> 00:43:00.700
It's Saoirse.

822
00:43:03.433 --> 00:43:06.266
Here are some extra blankets
and if you need anything else.

823
00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.033
my room is just down the hall.

824
00:43:08.166 --> 00:43:10.100
Thank you. Saoirse?

825
00:43:12.133 --> 00:43:14.166
What you have here
is incredible.

826
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.834
Your home and your work.

827
00:43:15.967 --> 00:43:17.934
no matter what your
aunt or anybody says.

828
00:43:19.667 --> 00:43:21.834
You're the first to say so.

829
00:43:21.967 --> 00:43:23.166
Mine's a small life

830
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.767
and nothing like where
you come from I'm sure.

831
00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.500
That's what's nice about it.

832
00:43:27.633 --> 00:43:30.600
There are people all over
the world would consider this

833
00:43:30.734 --> 00:43:32.033
a slice of heaven.

834
00:43:49.767 --> 00:43:51.166
I have a few more.

835
00:43:52.834 --> 00:43:54.333
This one.

836
00:43:55.033 --> 00:43:55.800
This one.

837
00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.800
Good morning.

838
00:43:58.934 --> 00:44:00.300
Morning.

839
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.567
You sure you
don't wanna drive?

840
00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.667
Oh no. no thanks.

841
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.734
We have a few stops to
make along the way today?

842
00:44:13.867 --> 00:44:14.967
No. not many.

843
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.300
There's a sweet old
lady. Mrs. O'Cleary.

844
00:44:16.433 --> 00:44:18.633
hasn't turned up for her
paper for a few days.

845
00:44:18.767 --> 00:44:20.133
She's elderly and lives alone.

846
00:44:20.266 --> 00:44:22.266
so I just wanna check and
make sure everything's okay.

847
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.400
Of course.

848
00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.633
Mrs. O'Cleary?

849
00:44:34.767 --> 00:44:37.300
Mrs. O'Cleary. it's
William from the Post.

850
00:44:42.567 --> 00:44:43.633
You see anyone?

851
00:44:43.767 --> 00:44:46.133
No. I've known Mrs.
O'Cleary most of my life.

852
00:44:46.266 --> 00:44:47.233
this isn't like her.

853
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.967
Is it proper to go in?

854
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.367
Under the circumstances.

855
00:44:52.834 --> 00:44:53.633
It's locked.

856
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.500
Let's try the back.

857
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.533
Mrs. O'Cleary?

858
00:45:12.166 --> 00:45:13.133
Mrs. O'Cleary?

859
00:45:13.266 --> 00:45:14.734
In here. lad.

860
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.333
Brought your newspaper and
your mail. Are you all right?

861
00:45:25.467 --> 00:45:27.533
I haven't been
feeling too well.

862
00:45:27.667 --> 00:45:29.800
I can hardly walk.

863
00:45:29.934 --> 00:45:31.233
I couldn't find the phone.

864
00:45:32.433 --> 00:45:33.867
You got a bad dose
of it. don't you?

865
00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:38.133
My hair feels manky.
it needs a wash.

866
00:45:38.266 --> 00:45:39.900
I think your hair looks grand.

867
00:45:41.266 --> 00:45:42.567
Another American. eh?

868
00:45:43.767 --> 00:45:44.967
Why do people
keep saying that?

869
00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:48.033
Most likely because
he was engaged to one.

870
00:45:50.934 --> 00:45:52.133
I'm gonna call you a doctor

871
00:45:52.266 --> 00:45:54.300
and wait with you here
until they arrive.

872
00:45:59.633 --> 00:46:00.467
Here.

873
00:46:04.967 --> 00:46:05.700
Oh. Thank you.

874
00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.600
Now. how long have you
and William been together?

875
00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.266
We're not together.

876
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.533
He's just helping me track
down the sender of a package.

877
00:46:16.667 --> 00:46:18.033
You could have fooled me.

878
00:46:18.166 --> 00:46:20.467
You two look like
a perfect pair.

879
00:46:23.166 --> 00:46:24.000
Thank you. Doctor.

880
00:46:24.133 --> 00:46:25.133
Sure thing.

881
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.934
She'll be in good
hands with Dr. Molloy.

882
00:46:30.066 --> 00:46:32.867
I hope she feels better
soon. she's a sweet lady.

883
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.867
Sure is. You ready to
find this J. O'Brien?

884
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.367
Let's crack on.

885
00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.533
O'Brien.

886
00:46:57.667 --> 00:46:58.700
J. O'Brien?

887
00:47:00.567 --> 00:47:01.667
Did you happen to send a package

888
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.600
to America through
the Post recently?

889
00:47:11.734 --> 00:47:15.133
Hey John. you happen to send
a package from the Post?

890
00:47:45.266 --> 00:47:46.867
Thank you. Father.

891
00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.266
You sure this
is the right place?

892
00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.066
Never
delivered here before.

893
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.166
but this must be it.

894
00:48:03.467 --> 00:48:06.200
Well. it wasn't me.
but if it had been.

895
00:48:06.333 --> 00:48:10.567
I would never part with
such a beautiful image.

896
00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.934
of such a beautiful woman.

897
00:48:17.533 --> 00:48:18.300
Thank you.

898
00:48:21.033 --> 00:48:22.400
You know. it's a
shame it wasn't him

899
00:48:22.533 --> 00:48:24.200
'cause it looks like you
could have been happy here.

900
00:48:24.333 --> 00:48:25.400
Oh yeah?

901
00:48:25.533 --> 00:48:26.633
Yep.

902
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:34.934
So any luck?

903
00:48:35.934 --> 00:48:37.633
We're down to three names.

904
00:48:37.767 --> 00:48:40.233
We've met a lot
of unique people.

905
00:48:41.467 --> 00:48:42.800
Everything okay at the Post?

906
00:48:42.934 --> 00:48:46.633
Yeah. busy as ever. We had
plenty of new parcels today.

907
00:48:46.767 --> 00:48:48.633
Sorry. I wasn't there to help.

908
00:48:48.767 --> 00:48:51.000
Don't be. I rather enjoyed it.

909
00:48:54.533 --> 00:48:55.300
I'll go help.

910
00:49:00.266 --> 00:49:02.567
That was really sweet of him.

911
00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:03.900
That's Will.

912
00:49:04.033 --> 00:49:06.500
he's always been a
naturally thoughtful person.

913
00:49:08.367 --> 00:49:11.567
and he's a really
talented artist too.

914
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:13.033
Really?

915
00:49:13.166 --> 00:49:15.567
Yeah. you should ask
him about his work.

916
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.066
I think you'll find you
have a lot in common.

917
00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:18.967
Good to know.

918
00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.033
Hey. the other
day. Mrs. O'Cleary

919
00:49:24.166 --> 00:49:28.467
mentioned that he was engaged
before. to an American?

920
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:33.200
Yeah. he was.
about five years ago.

921
00:49:33.333 --> 00:49:34.900
Rachel was her name.

922
00:49:35.033 --> 00:49:38.066
She was going to school
here. well in Dublin.

923
00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.967
A few months before the
wedding she just left.

924
00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:44.667
with no warning. no
conversation. no nothing.

925
00:49:46.066 --> 00:49:47.567
He hasn't been interested
in a relationship since.

926
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.867
and hasn't been a
big fan of Americans.

927
00:49:53.333 --> 00:49:58.166
But you have definitely
helped. in both those areas.

928
00:50:01.433 --> 00:50:06.400
So have you any idea who the
artist is behind the painting?

929
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.033
Not in the slightest.

930
00:50:09.533 --> 00:50:12.066
What are you gonna do when
you find out who painted it?

931
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.200
I just wanna know
why it looks like me.

932
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.900
Maybe it was
painted by someone

933
00:50:18.033 --> 00:50:19.400
who's madly in love with you.

934
00:50:19.533 --> 00:50:21.367
And it's your fate
to end up with them.

935
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.233
You sound like my
friend. Michelle.

936
00:50:23.367 --> 00:50:26.400
She is determined to get
me in a relationship again.

937
00:50:26.533 --> 00:50:28.533
She thinks this
painting is my destiny.

938
00:50:29.533 --> 00:50:30.834
But you never know.

939
00:50:32.367 --> 00:50:34.967
Destiny could walk up on you
when you least expect it.

940
00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.300
What did I miss?

941
00:50:48.467 --> 00:50:50.166
Thought you might
wanna look at these.

942
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:51.233
Thank you.

943
00:50:52.734 --> 00:50:56.000
I can't believe how many J.
O'Briens we've already met.

944
00:50:56.133 --> 00:50:57.567
It's been quite an adventure.

945
00:50:58.567 --> 00:50:59.367
That it has.

946
00:51:01.133 --> 00:51:02.567
You must be exhausted.

947
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.567
or at least fed up with
driving me everywhere.

948
00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:08.200
No. it's worth it.

949
00:51:10.166 --> 00:51:14.367
I thought maybe we could take
a break tomorrow. you know.

950
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.233
from the search.
do something fun

951
00:51:17.367 --> 00:51:20.000
as a thank you to
you and Saoirse.

952
00:51:20.967 --> 00:51:22.567
What did you have in mind?

953
00:51:25.667 --> 00:51:27.433
Saoirse really
didn't wanna come?

954
00:51:28.533 --> 00:51:30.533
Bad experience with a
kite when she was little.

955
00:51:30.667 --> 00:51:31.500
long story.

956
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.033
She mentioned
you're an artist.

957
00:51:37.367 --> 00:51:40.000
She did? What
else did she say?

958
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.400
Just said to ask you about it.

959
00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:44.800
What medium do you prefer?

960
00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.767
Pencil. watercolor.
oil painting.

961
00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.300
You'll have to show me
some of your work sometime.

962
00:51:52.567 --> 00:51:54.233
Do you have any I could look at?

963
00:51:54.367 --> 00:51:55.400
It was all just a hobby.

964
00:51:55.533 --> 00:51:57.333
I haven't done
anything in a while.

965
00:51:57.467 --> 00:52:00.266
I'd have to look and see
if I can find something.

966
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.233
I'd like that.

967
00:52:02.934 --> 00:52:03.800
Are you an artist?

968
00:52:03.934 --> 00:52:07.367
Me? No. I just appreciate art.

969
00:52:08.767 --> 00:52:10.333
Do you have a
favorite painting?

970
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.967
Girl With The Pearl
Earring. Vermeer.

971
00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.567
- Interesting.
-  Why?

972
00:52:17.066 --> 00:52:19.300
Well isn't that one
a bit of a mystery too?

973
00:52:19.433 --> 00:52:21.000
Who is the girl in the painting?

974
00:52:21.133 --> 00:52:22.066
I guess so.

975
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.333
Like your portrait.

976
00:52:23.467 --> 00:52:25.000
Well. we assume it's me.

977
00:52:25.133 --> 00:52:27.100
but we don't know
for sure or why.

978
00:52:28.367 --> 00:52:32.834
And Vermeer's was said to
be an imaginary figure.

979
00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.400
Though I do wonder who
inspired it.

980
00:52:36.533 --> 00:52:39.700
Do you ever think about
why the painting is of you?

981
00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.400
Yes.

982
00:52:42.867 --> 00:52:44.600
Nothing that
makes sense though.

983
00:52:44.734 --> 00:52:45.900
You have any ideas?

984
00:52:47.266 --> 00:52:48.233
Well I...

985
00:52:49.633 --> 00:52:50.800
Oh. oh!

986
00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:58.333
You know you and Saoirse
are really amazing.

987
00:52:58.467 --> 00:52:59.967
taking in a stranger.

988
00:53:00.166 --> 00:53:02.367
helping me track down
a thousand O'Briens.

989
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:03.300
Aye.

990
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:08.066
You know. I could have
been a fraud. or a thief.

991
00:53:09.033 --> 00:53:10.600
Or someone very dangerous.

992
00:53:11.967 --> 00:53:12.800
So could we.

993
00:53:14.633 --> 00:53:17.166
I like to think I have
good instincts about people.

994
00:53:18.166 --> 00:53:20.400
but it's good of you to help me.

995
00:53:20.533 --> 00:53:22.467
To be fair you're
hardly a stranger anymore.

996
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.867
Part of me feels like I've
known you most of my life.

997
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:27.800
Really?

998
00:53:30.834 --> 00:53:32.967
You're the best thing
to come to the village.

999
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:36.233
I don't know what I will do when

1000
00:53:38.166 --> 00:53:40.567
you find the answers
you're looking for.

1001
00:53:43.433 --> 00:53:45.834
Well. it'll be hard for
me to go back home now.

1002
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:47.734
So thank you.

1003
00:54:11.834 --> 00:54:13.100
Yes.

1004
00:54:13.233 --> 00:54:14.633
You told her about my art?

1005
00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:16.500
And?

1006
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:18.700
Remember your promise?

1007
00:54:19.567 --> 00:54:21.934
I didn't tell her it was you.

1008
00:54:22.066 --> 00:54:24.100
but she is going to
find out eventually.

1009
00:54:24.233 --> 00:54:25.934
and I think the
sooner. the better.

1010
00:54:26.066 --> 00:54:27.633
I know. but I can't tell her.

1011
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.433
I keep thinking about it. but I
know it'll mess everything up.

1012
00:54:31.567 --> 00:54:34.266
I genuinely enjoy
spending time with her.

1013
00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.467
But if she finds out.

1014
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:39.266
I don't see how it could be
anything but a disappointment.

1015
00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.433
Why?

1016
00:54:40.567 --> 00:54:42.700
Because. how do
you explain it?

1017
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:47.600
I'm trying to protect you
from getting your heart broken.

1018
00:54:47.734 --> 00:54:50.467
Relationships are built
on honesty. William.

1019
00:54:53.934 --> 00:54:55.433
Only three names left?

1020
00:54:55.567 --> 00:54:56.533
William thinks
we're gonna find him

1021
00:54:56.667 --> 00:54:58.233
by the end of the week.

1022
00:54:58.367 --> 00:54:59.800
Do you need me back sooner?

1023
00:54:59.934 --> 00:55:02.100
No. we've got everything
under control here.

1024
00:55:02.233 --> 00:55:03.767
Now. Lily.

1025
00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.600
you realize that you haven't
talked much about the painting.

1026
00:55:06.734 --> 00:55:10.333
The last few calls. all you
seem to talk about is William.

1027
00:55:10.467 --> 00:55:12.500
Because he's helping
me with the painting.

1028
00:55:12.633 --> 00:55:13.433
Is that all?

1029
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.934
I enjoy spending
time with him.

1030
00:55:17.066 --> 00:55:19.500
It's nice to have him around
as we work on this together.

1031
00:55:19.633 --> 00:55:20.800
How long have I been
trying to get you to go

1032
00:55:20.934 --> 00:55:22.266
out with someone?

1033
00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.033
We're not going out.

1034
00:55:24.166 --> 00:55:25.667
It's not wrong to date
because you're lonely

1035
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:26.867
or want company.

1036
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.700
We're not dating?

1037
00:55:28.834 --> 00:55:30.667
No. you're just staying in
his house and spending all day-

1038
00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.266
His sister's around!

1039
00:55:33.633 --> 00:55:36.567
Besides. I'm here
to find the artist.

1040
00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:46.467
I shouldn't have waited
this long to tell you.

1041
00:55:48.767 --> 00:55:52.033
I am the one that
painted your portrait.

1042
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.700
You see. I used to
dream about you.

1043
00:55:55.834 --> 00:55:58.500
or at least someone who
looks just like you.

1044
00:55:58.633 --> 00:56:01.834
What? That was
horrible. try again.

1045
00:56:04.633 --> 00:56:06.500
You are the girl in
my dreams. literally?

1046
00:56:06.633 --> 00:56:08.467
Try again.

1047
00:56:11.967 --> 00:56:13.934
I'm the one that
painted your portrait.

1048
00:56:15.166 --> 00:56:16.734
It was wrong of me not
to tell you earlier.

1049
00:56:16.867 --> 00:56:18.100
but I didn't know how.

1050
00:56:18.233 --> 00:56:20.667
This is working. continue.

1051
00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:24.367
I didn't know how to
tell you. I've wanted to.

1052
00:56:26.367 --> 00:56:27.433
but it's just that
my sister insisted-

1053
00:56:28.367 --> 00:56:29.734
You see.

1054
00:56:29.867 --> 00:56:32.233
how do you say it out loud
without sounding so. so-

1055
00:56:32.367 --> 00:56:36.400
Desperate. pathetic.
disturbing. pitiful?

1056
00:56:36.533 --> 00:56:37.333
Exactly.

1057
00:56:39.533 --> 00:56:40.967
But. you are getting better.

1058
00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.200
There you are.
You ready to go?

1059
00:56:48.166 --> 00:56:50.834
He better be. he's been
practicing all morning.

1060
00:56:54.867 --> 00:56:58.000
c)

1061
00:57:02.433 --> 00:57:03.500
Why do you do that?

1062
00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:06.734
Dunno. everyone does
it when you're driving

1063
00:57:06.867 --> 00:57:09.433
on these narrow country
roads at low speed.

1064
00:57:09.567 --> 00:57:10.800
I'll keep that in mind.

1065
00:57:10.934 --> 00:57:13.233
if I ever get behind
the wheel again.

1066
00:57:20.967 --> 00:57:23.900
Your sister will not be
happy if I crash her car.

1067
00:57:24.033 --> 00:57:24.900
You're doing fine.

1068
00:57:27.633 --> 00:57:30.100
Have you ever heard
of Hans Holbien?

1069
00:57:30.233 --> 00:57:32.467
The court portrait artist
for King Henry? Why do you ask?

1070
00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:33.967
Yeah. Michelle brought
him up the other day

1071
00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:35.467
and it got me thinking.

1072
00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.567
Maybe the artist who
painted the portrait

1073
00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:39.000
that looked like
me was commissioned

1074
00:57:39.133 --> 00:57:41.133
by the O'Brien who
sent the painting.

1075
00:57:41.266 --> 00:57:44.467
A paid sitting? Interesting
theory. but I don't think so.

1076
00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.900
Why not?

1077
00:57:46.033 --> 00:57:47.233
Because it's you and I
assume you didn't hire someone

1078
00:57:47.367 --> 00:57:49.166
to paint your portrait.

1079
00:57:51.266 --> 00:57:52.567
We got one coming.

1080
00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:54.900
You ready? Just pick a
point on the road ahead of you

1081
00:57:55.033 --> 00:57:56.700
and keep it in
your line of sight.

1082
00:58:00.967 --> 00:58:01.800
You're a natural.

1083
00:58:08.667 --> 00:58:09.800
Sorry.

1084
00:58:09.934 --> 00:58:11.066
Thanks for your time.

1085
00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:13.467
Thank you. Bye.

1086
00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:21.500
I'm really sorry.

1087
00:58:21.633 --> 00:58:22.900
Thank you for your time.

1088
00:58:23.033 --> 00:58:24.266
- See you.
- Bye.

1089
00:58:27.033 --> 00:58:29.400
Only one name left.

1090
00:58:39.533 --> 00:58:40.333
Is this it?

1091
00:58:41.467 --> 00:58:42.834
Maybe she's out at the back?

1092
00:58:47.367 --> 00:58:51.166
Hi. my name is William.

1093
00:58:57.133 --> 00:58:59.300
Hi. my name is William.
This is my friend.

1094
00:59:00.734 --> 00:59:01.567
She's deaf.

1095
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:07.667
Hi. my name is Lily and
this is my friend William.

1096
00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:17.266
I can mostly tell
what you're meaning.

1097
00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:22.367
but you must be foreign
because my sign is different.

1098
01:00:07.734 --> 01:00:09.900
She said we can stay
as long as we'd like.

1099
01:00:12.166 --> 01:00:13.700
Maybe we didn't make
the search wide enough.

1100
01:00:13.834 --> 01:00:14.800
Maybe I missed some.

1101
01:00:16.266 --> 01:00:18.300
I think it's the
end of the line.

1102
01:00:18.433 --> 01:00:19.367
You're giving up?

1103
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.734
Think we've
looked long enough.

1104
01:00:22.867 --> 01:00:24.300
Maybe it wasn't meant to be.

1105
01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.633
I know just the thing
to help cheer you up.

1106
01:00:34.033 --> 01:00:35.233
What is this place?

1107
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.400
Mom used to bring me
here when I was a kid.

1108
01:00:39.533 --> 01:00:40.934
It's so beautiful.

1109
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.533
Here.

1110
01:00:56.667 --> 01:00:58.033
I finally get to see them?

1111
01:00:59.066 --> 01:01:00.400
They're nothing amazing.

1112
01:01:01.667 --> 01:01:04.400
William. these are amazing.

1113
01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.133
You've never had
formal training?

1114
01:01:08.266 --> 01:01:09.400
I just started young.

1115
01:01:11.333 --> 01:01:13.700
I'd get these images in my head

1116
01:01:13.834 --> 01:01:15.700
that I couldn't
express with words.

1117
01:01:15.834 --> 01:01:19.633
so I just drew what I saw.

1118
01:01:22.834 --> 01:01:24.166
What made you stop?

1119
01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:27.967
A few things. my fiancé
leaving me was one of them.

1120
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.300
Saoirse told me a little.

1121
01:01:32.767 --> 01:01:35.633
Thought I was in
love. real love.

1122
01:01:37.767 --> 01:01:42.400
Maybe it was just the idea
of love that I enjoyed.

1123
01:01:44.166 --> 01:01:47.533
She really just disappeared?
Didn't say anything?

1124
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.934
Saoirse saw her loading
her bag and driving away.

1125
01:01:52.433 --> 01:01:56.734
I called her. her
family. no response.

1126
01:01:58.233 --> 01:01:59.600
Even after a week of
not hearing from her.

1127
01:01:59.734 --> 01:02:02.867
still held out hope
that she would return.

1128
01:02:04.333 --> 01:02:06.500
After all. the planned wedding
was only a few months away.

1129
01:02:07.533 --> 01:02:09.767
We didn't have any major issues.

1130
01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.500
As far as I knew we were happy.

1131
01:02:11.633 --> 01:02:13.100
I'm sorry.

1132
01:02:13.233 --> 01:02:14.867
I just stayed
busy with the Post.

1133
01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.200
The leaving bothered
me for a long time.

1134
01:02:22.133 --> 01:02:27.000
I just wanted to know the why.
but now I don't need to know.

1135
01:02:28.233 --> 01:02:30.767
I no longer wonder
if I was good enough.

1136
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:35.867
I am clear that this hurt.
it isn't mine to hold.

1137
01:02:36.667 --> 01:02:37.700
it's undoubtedly hers.

1138
01:02:39.367 --> 01:02:41.667
So. I just accepted what
happened and moved on.

1139
01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:45.400
Have you been in a
relationship since?

1140
01:02:45.533 --> 01:02:50.367
No. I tell myself it's
okay to be alone though.

1141
01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.867
It can be hard.

1142
01:02:54.033 --> 01:02:55.033
What happened to Greg?

1143
01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:57.633
Car accident.

1144
01:02:59.066 --> 01:03:01.734
I was going to school while
he served in the military.

1145
01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:07.100
He went on several
tours. was never injured.

1146
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:13.834
And then he comes home and he
gets killed in a car crash.

1147
01:03:13.967 --> 01:03:15.367
falling asleep at the wheel.

1148
01:03:17.133 --> 01:03:18.600
I'm sorry.

1149
01:03:18.734 --> 01:03:20.967
After a while I
missed his kisses.

1150
01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:25.100
having a warm body next to
mine. his head on my shoulder.

1151
01:03:27.233 --> 01:03:28.633
It's enough to drive
anyone to start dating

1152
01:03:28.767 --> 01:03:29.767
before you're ready.

1153
01:03:33.367 --> 01:03:36.667
I thought maybe I could fill
the void. Heal some pain.

1154
01:03:37.567 --> 01:03:38.367
Did it?

1155
01:03:39.934 --> 01:03:43.166
No. I only went out once.

1156
01:03:44.934 --> 01:03:47.200
I haven't even told my
best friend about this.

1157
01:03:48.567 --> 01:03:53.266
We met at the gym. first
mistake right there.

1158
01:03:54.066 --> 01:03:55.266
And we went to dinner.

1159
01:03:57.133 --> 01:04:00.900
I got this feeling of
overwhelming guilt and betrayal.

1160
01:04:02.834 --> 01:04:04.834
The whole night I was
looking around the restaurant

1161
01:04:04.967 --> 01:04:06.867
for someone that I knew.

1162
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.233
I thought that if they
saw me with another man.

1163
01:04:09.367 --> 01:04:12.400
first thing they would do is
rush home and tell my husband.

1164
01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.000
I know it sounds
silly because he's...

1165
01:04:19.867 --> 01:04:24.300
Needless to say. I
changed gyms.

1166
01:04:24.433 --> 01:04:25.600
Probably for the best.

1167
01:04:27.033 --> 01:04:27.767
Definitely.

1168
01:04:37.633 --> 01:04:41.834
Wow! William it's beautiful.

1169
01:04:44.033 --> 01:04:44.834
You are.

1170
01:04:50.533 --> 01:04:52.800
Do you think you'll be
able to find love again?

1171
01:04:54.867 --> 01:04:58.133
I don't know. I'm
starting to hope so.

1172
01:05:35.867 --> 01:05:37.333
It's Saoirse.

1173
01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:38.667
You should answer that.

1174
01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.400
Everything good at the Post?

1175
01:05:42.533 --> 01:05:44.567
Of course. but I have
an address for you.

1176
01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.066
- Is it an O'Brien?
- Better.

1177
01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.867
The address of a charity
where the painting ended up.

1178
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.166
I was cleaning up around
here and I found an old flyer

1179
01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.867
asking for donations.
it was a church.

1180
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I remember. I figured it was a
better place for the painting

1181
01:05:56.133 --> 01:05:57.500
than the rubbish bin.

1182
01:05:57.633 --> 01:05:59.200
Fantastic text it to me.

1183
01:05:59.333 --> 01:06:01.100
Did you tell her yet?

1184
01:06:01.233 --> 01:06:04.066
Okay. Saoirse bye now.

1185
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.066
Another O'Brien?

1186
01:06:06.233 --> 01:06:07.834
You willing to
give it another go?

1187
01:06:08.934 --> 01:06:09.700
Sure.

1188
01:06:26.633 --> 01:06:28.166
I wanted to-

1189
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.066
Is that it?

1190
01:06:48.066 --> 01:06:49.200
Good morning. Sister.

1191
01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:54.433
We were wondering if
you could help us.

1192
01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.400
I'm sorry. I don't
know any O'Briens.

1193
01:06:59.533 --> 01:07:00.834
Do you still take donations?

1194
01:07:00.967 --> 01:07:03.033
Yes. many don't
know what to do

1195
01:07:03.166 --> 01:07:06.000
with their loved one's
items after they pass.

1196
01:07:06.133 --> 01:07:07.867
Bequeathing extra
items to charity

1197
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.333
is a constructive way to
honor a loved one's memory.

1198
01:07:11.467 --> 01:07:15.333
We've seen everything from
clothing. to electronics.

1199
01:07:15.467 --> 01:07:16.900
once even a car.

1200
01:07:18.333 --> 01:07:19.734
My favorite is the art.

1201
01:07:20.667 --> 01:07:21.967
What happens to it all?

1202
01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.867
Father Gallagher
knows who can use what.

1203
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.500
But where does all the art go?

1204
01:07:26.633 --> 01:07:28.000
Those are sent to
an auction house.

1205
01:07:28.133 --> 01:07:30.467
with the proceeds
going to the church.

1206
01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.800
Do you happen to know
which auction house?

1207
01:07:34.166 --> 01:07:37.200
Shepherd's Auction House.

1208
01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:38.333
You have 20 minutes

1209
01:07:38.467 --> 01:07:41.300
until your destination.
continue straight.

1210
01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:48.700
All right. how
many you got there?.

1211
01:07:48.834 --> 01:07:50.200
I see you one what do you want?

1212
01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:51.633
Get one going now.
two going now 25.

1213
01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.000
I see 25. And we see a three.

1214
01:07:53.133 --> 01:07:54.834
What do you want? Get
for them 25 further now.

1215
01:07:54.967 --> 01:07:58.800
All right. 25. 25
once. 25 twice. and 25.

1216
01:08:00.934 --> 01:08:01.734
Hope it's lucky.

1217
01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.133
Okay. Next up today. we
have a gorgeous work of art.

1218
01:08:06.266 --> 01:08:08.800
Prettiest thing I've seen since
my wife on our wedding day.

1219
01:08:08.934 --> 01:08:12.200
Let's get going. shall we?
Who wants this wonderful item?

1220
01:08:14.233 --> 01:08:17.633
J. O'Brien. is it how
long ago did you say?

1221
01:08:17.767 --> 01:08:18.967
Around five years?

1222
01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:21.100
Five years ago. Okay.

1223
01:08:21.233 --> 01:08:23.200
Let's have a look.
O'Brien. O'Brien.

1224
01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.100
Ah. yes. here we go.

1225
01:08:28.233 --> 01:08:31.266
A portrait was sold
to Jonathan O'Brien.

1226
01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.467
Jonathan.

1227
01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.433
For 500. Do you know him?

1228
01:08:34.567 --> 01:08:35.934
He's a good man.

1229
01:08:36.066 --> 01:08:37.934
I haven't seen him around
here for a while now.

1230
01:08:38.066 --> 01:08:41.066
but I can give you
directions to where he lives.

1231
01:08:45.567 --> 01:08:47.166
I can't believe
we're this close.

1232
01:09:16.433 --> 01:09:19.367
What kind of flowers
are in this sketch.

1233
01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.266
Easter lilies.

1234
01:09:21.834 --> 01:09:22.934
I think this is it.

1235
01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:42.967
Jonathan O'Brien?

1236
01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.633
For the last 70 years.

1237
01:09:48.467 --> 01:09:49.300
William Murphy.

1238
01:09:54.166 --> 01:09:54.967
It's you.

1239
01:09:56.934 --> 01:09:57.967
Do you know me?

1240
01:09:59.734 --> 01:10:00.967
I can't believe my eyes.

1241
01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:04.934
The woman from the painting.

1242
01:10:07.767 --> 01:10:11.333
My wife and I went on
holiday to America.

1243
01:10:11.467 --> 01:10:13.567
We really loved one
of the museums there.

1244
01:10:15.066 --> 01:10:18.767
We spent the entire day
taking in its splendor.

1245
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.934
It's one of my most
beautiful memories.

1246
01:10:24.633 --> 01:10:28.767
Shortly after we returned
home. Alannah became sick.

1247
01:10:31.233 --> 01:10:34.000
I bought a painting
at the auction for her

1248
01:10:34.133 --> 01:10:35.567
because she loved it so much.

1249
01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:41.667
Alannah passed away
a few months ago.

1250
01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:42.734
I'm so sorry.

1251
01:10:44.233 --> 01:10:45.066
Before she died.

1252
01:10:46.633 --> 01:10:50.667
she suggested that I send
the painting to the museum

1253
01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.934
in America that we love.

1254
01:10:53.834 --> 01:10:54.767
It made it there.

1255
01:10:56.166 --> 01:10:57.266
That's where I work.

1256
01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.000
That's truly amazing.

1257
01:11:07.367 --> 01:11:09.166
It's where it's
supposed to be then.

1258
01:11:25.533 --> 01:11:27.433
Why did you paint me?

1259
01:11:30.367 --> 01:11:32.667
You sign all your
work with lilies.

1260
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.033
just like in the painting.

1261
01:11:36.533 --> 01:11:38.100
It's you. isn't it?

1262
01:11:39.233 --> 01:11:41.000
It was my mother's
favorite flower.

1263
01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.834
All this time.

1264
01:11:45.967 --> 01:11:47.367
Why didn't you say something?

1265
01:11:48.867 --> 01:11:50.066
I wanted to find out how
the painting ended up with you

1266
01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.333
just as much as you did.

1267
01:11:52.367 --> 01:11:55.300
Why me? Why did you paint me?

1268
01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:02.333
When I was eight. I woke
from a dream with faint image

1269
01:12:02.467 --> 01:12:05.767
of a face. like a drawing
that had just been started.

1270
01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.900
Month after month. the image
became more clear. more formed.

1271
01:12:10.033 --> 01:12:11.934
more coming to life in my mind.

1272
01:12:13.433 --> 01:12:14.500
By the time I was a teenager.

1273
01:12:14.633 --> 01:12:16.467
I had the most vivid
image in my dreams.

1274
01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.333
as clear as I see you here now.

1275
01:12:19.467 --> 01:12:22.100
I started to sketch to see if
I could express what I saw.

1276
01:12:23.233 --> 01:12:24.900
So my sketches
became the painting.

1277
01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:29.500
You never saw anyone
who looks like me. or me?

1278
01:12:30.867 --> 01:12:32.734
I don't know why I
kept seeing your face.

1279
01:12:32.867 --> 01:12:35.133
I didn't even think
you were real.

1280
01:12:35.266 --> 01:12:37.400
When things became more
serious with Rachel.

1281
01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:42.500
I knew I needed to
move on. forget about this

1282
01:12:42.633 --> 01:12:43.867
made-up woman in my mind.

1283
01:12:46.934 --> 01:12:50.433
I thought I had moved on.
until you walked into my life.

1284
01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.166
It all sounds so-

1285
01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:55.300
I know how it sounds.

1286
01:12:55.433 --> 01:12:57.734
And that's why I didn't
say anything earlier.

1287
01:12:57.867 --> 01:12:58.700
I didn't know how.

1288
01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.300
Please say something.

1289
01:13:06.166 --> 01:13:10.867
I just. I wish you would've
to told me the truth.

1290
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.066
And if I had. how would
you have looked at me?

1291
01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:17.900
I can't wrap my head
around it. It doesn't matter.

1292
01:13:18.033 --> 01:13:21.567
You kept me here and
didn't tell me. so what.

1293
01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.066
so I would stay?

1294
01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:26.300
Yes. no. no.

1295
01:13:26.433 --> 01:13:27.600
It wasn't like that.

1296
01:13:30.166 --> 01:13:31.800
We've wasted so much time.

1297
01:13:33.033 --> 01:13:34.400
It wasn't a waste for me.

1298
01:13:35.667 --> 01:13:37.633
I wouldn't have changed
it for anything.

1299
01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:42.533
I came here to find answers.
to find who painted it.

1300
01:13:42.667 --> 01:13:43.467
Not to fall-

1301
01:13:44.333 --> 01:13:45.367
In love?

1302
01:13:50.767 --> 01:13:52.633
I think it's time
for me to go home.

1303
01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:58.800
So that's it? You
leave. back to America?

1304
01:14:00.867 --> 01:14:02.567
Yeah.

1305
01:14:06.033 --> 01:14:08.200
I know how I feel about you.

1306
01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:11.567
But it can't be real.

1307
01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:14.333
You only feel that way
because of your dreams.

1308
01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:20.200
Dreams or not. you're
right here in front of me.

1309
01:14:22.233 --> 01:14:25.166
Real as can be. and something
brought us together.

1310
01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.834
I can't.

1311
01:14:39.533 --> 01:14:40.967
I'm sorry. I can't.

1312
01:15:03.033 --> 01:15:04.667
Are you going
to let her leave?

1313
01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.266
It's her choice.

1314
01:15:09.767 --> 01:15:12.066
Don't be afraid of what
you're feeling William.

1315
01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.233
do everything you can.

1316
01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.500
Thank you for being
so kind and wonderful.

1317
01:15:23.467 --> 01:15:25.166
Are you sure you have to go?

1318
01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.100
It's time.

1319
01:15:43.233 --> 01:15:44.767
Um. About yesterday-

1320
01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.033
Don't worry about it.

1321
01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:48.934
It wasn't a mistake.

1322
01:15:50.533 --> 01:15:51.333
Wasn't it?

1323
01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.500
Look. you don't
have to apologize.

1324
01:15:55.633 --> 01:15:56.967
if that's what you're doing.

1325
01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:59.633
I'm not apologizing
for kissing you.

1326
01:15:59.767 --> 01:16:00.967
I'm not apologizing
for not telling-

1327
01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:02.000
It's fine.

1328
01:16:07.367 --> 01:16:08.300
All right.

1329
01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.600
Safe travels then.

1330
01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:13.967
Lily.

1331
01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:47.500
Do you think he
was your soulmate?

1332
01:17:54.266 --> 01:17:56.734
Do you think he
was your soulmate?

1333
01:17:58.333 --> 01:17:59.900
That concept implies
that you're not whole

1334
01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:01.300
without someone else.

1335
01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:05.367
Feeling that you need
someone to complete you.

1336
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.300
it's a horrible way to
start a relationship.

1337
01:18:09.433 --> 01:18:11.967
Maybe a soulmate is
determined by what they do.

1338
01:18:13.667 --> 01:18:15.967
A soulmate is a person
who appears in your life

1339
01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:17.734
in order to teach you something.

1340
01:18:19.834 --> 01:18:21.367
I need to let
this go. Michelle.

1341
01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.200
But why? You're miserable.

1342
01:18:23.333 --> 01:18:24.967
Everyone can see that.

1343
01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.300
He was your soulmate.

1344
01:18:26.433 --> 01:18:28.467
Stop saying that. he's not.

1345
01:18:31.667 --> 01:18:32.467
Can't be.

1346
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.867
If he is. then what was Greg?

1347
01:18:39.333 --> 01:18:41.567
Fate. destiny. soulmates.

1348
01:18:42.767 --> 01:18:45.066
You keep saying that
about William but.

1349
01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.467
Greg was my one and only.

1350
01:18:50.066 --> 01:18:51.133
and then he was gone.

1351
01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.467
What if Greg.
wasn't the only one?

1352
01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:08.934
You really banjaxed this one.

1353
01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.367
Beyond repair?

1354
01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.367
With your foostering about.

1355
01:19:14.834 --> 01:19:16.200
You truly believe in fate?

1356
01:19:17.667 --> 01:19:20.100
Fate isn't a matter of
waiting for the one and only

1357
01:19:20.233 --> 01:19:21.700
to walk by and grab you.

1358
01:19:23.066 --> 01:19:25.000
Fate brought you together.
but it's up to you

1359
01:19:25.133 --> 01:19:26.533
to do something about it.

1360
01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:29.166
You think I
should go after her?

1361
01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:30.834
If you want her back. yeah.

1362
01:19:32.066 --> 01:19:34.767
We make our own future
from our own actions

1363
01:19:35.967 --> 01:19:38.467
and nothing or no one
else is responsible.

1364
01:19:39.567 --> 01:19:42.000
No fate but what we make.

1365
01:19:42.133 --> 01:19:44.166
I just want her to be happy.

1366
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:47.367
And she can be.
you both can be.

1367
01:19:48.567 --> 01:19:50.967
but you both have to be
willing to take a risk.

1368
01:19:53.734 --> 01:19:54.533
Go to her.

1369
01:19:55.967 --> 01:19:56.934
For how long?

1370
01:19:57.066 --> 01:19:58.767
For as long as it takes.

1371
01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.800
You want to. don't
think I can't see that.

1372
01:20:04.233 --> 01:20:06.667
You're a wonderful
brother William.

1373
01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:10.233
patiently willing to sacrifice
your future to stay here.

1374
01:20:10.367 --> 01:20:12.467
But you don't have to.

1375
01:20:13.734 --> 01:20:14.600
I won't see this
place left behind.

1376
01:20:14.734 --> 01:20:15.834
And neither will I.

1377
01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:17.834
What do you mean?

1378
01:20:17.967 --> 01:20:20.867
Deidre. Jimmy they've
got it all wrong.

1379
01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.700
I like it here.

1380
01:20:23.834 --> 01:20:27.400
Everyone keeps pushing me
to make something of myself.

1381
01:20:27.533 --> 01:20:29.600
but I already have.

1382
01:20:29.734 --> 01:20:32.400
You mean you wanna keep
running the Post by yourself?

1383
01:20:32.533 --> 01:20:35.266
Yeah. is there
something wrong with that?

1384
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.333
- No. but-
- It's my home.

1385
01:20:38.467 --> 01:20:40.967
Besides. maybe I'll
hire some help.

1386
01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.333
A handsome foreigner who
stumbles into the village.

1387
01:20:45.467 --> 01:20:46.600
All right. all right.

1388
01:20:49.233 --> 01:20:51.333
You mean it though?
- Yeah.

1389
01:20:51.467 --> 01:20:54.300
So you see? There's
nothing holding you back.

1390
01:21:06.633 --> 01:21:09.100
Hey Lily. Michelle wants
your opinion on a new exhibit.

1391
01:21:09.233 --> 01:21:10.233
You got a second?

1392
01:21:10.367 --> 01:21:11.433
- Sure.
- Right here.

1393
01:21:15.133 --> 01:21:16.266
What do you
think of this here?

1394
01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.734
I'm thinking the
lighting may be off.

1395
01:21:18.867 --> 01:21:20.000
You're not seriously-

1396
01:21:20.133 --> 01:21:22.600
Of course. yes. I
think it's beautiful.

1397
01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.166
My favorite feature
is the passion in it.

1398
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.667
You can really feel how
much the painter loves her.

1399
01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.834
Can't you?

1400
01:21:30.967 --> 01:21:32.033
Feelings change.

1401
01:21:33.233 --> 01:21:35.066
He may not feel
that way anymore.

1402
01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.600
Do you want him to?

1403
01:21:36.734 --> 01:21:37.834
We've talked about this.

1404
01:21:37.967 --> 01:21:40.400
I've listened to you
talk yourself out of it.

1405
01:21:40.533 --> 01:21:41.934
But you love him.

1406
01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.233
It's funny though.

1407
01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:47.567
because you're missing
the most spectacular part.

1408
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:50.100
Fate. the painting
coming to me. I know.

1409
01:21:50.233 --> 01:21:53.667
No. that fate is at
work a second time.

1410
01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.567
First for Greg now for William.

1411
01:21:56.700 --> 01:22:01.166
Don't you see. it's fate
for you to be happy again.

1412
01:22:02.367 --> 01:22:03.667
I don't know if you
believe in fate.

1413
01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:06.367
but you and William
were brought together

1414
01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.066
and it doesn't lessen
what you had with Greg.

1415
01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.233
it's because he's gone.

1416
01:22:11.367 --> 01:22:14.066
This is another chance
for you to love again.

1417
01:22:15.266 --> 01:22:16.333
Will you let it go?

1418
01:22:17.533 --> 01:22:20.100
It's too late. I hurt him.

1419
01:22:21.266 --> 01:22:23.033
Just say. you're sorry.

1420
01:22:23.166 --> 01:22:24.066
I wish I could.

1421
01:22:25.934 --> 01:22:28.734
This. was just left for you.

1422
01:22:28.867 --> 01:22:30.567
Who is that from?

1423
01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:33.633
I don't know. a guy just
brought it to the front desk.

1424
01:22:33.767 --> 01:22:36.233
I tried your office.
but you weren't there.

1425
01:22:36.367 --> 01:22:37.467
Where is he?

1426
01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.066
He just walked out
the front entrance.

1427
01:22:53.033 --> 01:22:54.633
William? You're here.

1428
01:22:58.033 --> 01:22:59.233
Is that okay?

1429
01:23:06.266 --> 01:23:07.600
Where's Saoirse?

1430
01:23:07.734 --> 01:23:10.900
At home. manning the Post.
and loving it actually.

1431
01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.400
I've missed you. didn't
think I should. but I do.

1432
01:23:15.533 --> 01:23:17.567
didn't think I should.
but I do.

1433
01:23:26.233 --> 01:23:27.734
Does that mean you forgive me?

1434
01:23:28.867 --> 01:23:31.066
I'm more worried
about you forgiving me.

1435
01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.533
What for?

1436
01:23:32.667 --> 01:23:35.900
For treating what we had
together like it was nothing.

1437
01:23:37.767 --> 01:23:40.500
Like our time together didn't
mean anything. and it did.

1438
01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:44.300
I can't risk sitting
back and losing you.

1439
01:23:44.433 --> 01:23:46.500
but more than anything.
I want you to you happy.

1440
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:48.567
You make me happy.

1441
01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.200
I do?

1442
01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:54.166
I didn't think I could
be happy again. but I am.

1443
01:23:56.667 --> 01:23:58.300
The painting found
its way to me.

1444
01:23:59.533 --> 01:24:02.033
and I found my way to you.

1445
01:24:02.166 --> 01:24:04.133
I know it startled
you. the painting.

1446
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.367
I'm just so glad you're real.

1447
01:24:10.567 --> 01:24:12.633
I was drawn to you before
we ever met. but now.

1448
01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:17.367
I never loved anyone
like I love you.

1449
01:24:19.734 --> 01:24:22.300
You're so much more than just
the woman of my dreams.

1450
01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:35.200
I'll try to keep
living up to that.

1451
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.767
because you deserve
to be happy too.

1452
01:24:39.734 --> 01:24:42.633
You've made me feel
and love again.

1453
01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:48.200
So does that mean
you love me too?

1454
01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:50.033
It just might.
