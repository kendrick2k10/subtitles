<i>He's just finishing another call.</i>

322
00:20:16.083 --> 00:20:18.125
<i>-Yeah. okay. Just hold on one sec.</i>
<i>-[man 1] Yeah.</i>

323
00:20:18.208 --> 00:20:20.708
<i>-Forget about the website.</i>
<i>-[woman] Hey. Omar. The kids okay?</i>

324
00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:23.583
<i>Oh. yeah. they're great. they're great.</i>
<i>What… What's going on here?</i>

325
00:20:23.666 --> 00:20:26.666
<i>Oh. you know. the storm just scared away</i>
<i>some of our international teams.</i>

326
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:30.458
<i>and so my brother decided to waive</i>
<i>the entrance fee for the local fishermen.</i>

327
00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:31.666
<i>which makes my life--</i>

328
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.958
<i>That's why I'm calling you myself.</i>
<i>so you can hear it directly from me.</i>

329
00:20:35.041 --> 00:20:37.250
<i>The tournament will proceed as planned.</i>

330
00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:38.541
<i>Tricia. I can come back if--</i>

331
00:20:38.625 --> 00:20:40.541
<i>-Give me Fitzpatrick's cell number.</i>
<i>-No. hold on.</i>

332
00:20:41.125 --> 00:20:42.375
<i>Omar. what do you need?</i>

333
00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:45.125
<i>We have flooding in the house. [chuckles]</i>

334
00:20:45.625 --> 00:20:48.125
<i>You know. if we could borrow a bilge pump.</i>

335
00:20:48.208 --> 00:20:50.958
<i>it'd be really… We'd appreciate it.</i>

336
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:54.416
<i>Bilge pump? I mean. yeah. Sure. of course.</i>
<i>Let's go talk to Quique.</i>

337
00:20:55.791 --> 00:20:58.250
<i>I really hate to ask you this. but…</i>

338
00:20:59.583 --> 00:21:02.208
<i>Omar. is everything okay?</i>

339
00:21:02.916 --> 00:21:04.625
<i>What do you mean? What's going on?</i>

340
00:21:05.166 --> 00:21:07.333
<i>I was wondering</i>
<i>if you could talk to the bank for us.</i>

341
00:21:07.416 --> 00:21:08.291
<i>[man 1] The bank?</i>

342
00:21:09.541 --> 00:21:12.250
<i>We just need a little more time</i>
<i>to pay what we owe.</i>

343
00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:15.125
<i>And if you could put in a good word</i>
<i>at the bank…</i>

344
00:21:15.208 --> 00:21:16.750
<i>How much do you owe exactly?</i>

345
00:21:18.291 --> 00:21:20.291
<i>$117.000.</i>

346
00:21:20.375 --> 00:21:21.250
<i>Oh boy.</i>

347
00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:24.500
<i>Okay. All right.</i>
<i>Well. how much time do you need?</i>

348
00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:29.125
<i>They… They gave us 30 days.</i>
<i>but. uh. we lost some donors and--</i>

349
00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:32.541
<i>-I'll look into it and see what I can--</i>
<i>-[man 2] How's the storm?</i>

350
00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:34.583
<i>-Oh no.</i>
<i>-Oh.</i>

351
00:21:34.666 --> 00:21:36.375
<i>[man 2] A little late. [chuckles]</i>

352
00:21:39.875 --> 00:21:40.833
<i>[man 1] Wade?</i>

353
00:21:40.916 --> 00:21:44.541
<i>Hey. Biz. Feels like old times.</i>

354
00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:46.208
<i>Only you're older and fatter.</i>

355
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.208
<i>Wade. old buddy. I'm sorry. but I'm afraid</i>
<i>you don't qualify for this list.</i>

356
00:21:52.083 --> 00:21:55.916
<i>What are you talking about? The radio said</i>
<i>no entry fees for local captains.</i>

357
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.833
<i>Local fishermen.</i>
<i>You're from San Diego. Wade.</i>

358

<i>You cannot be serious.</i>

359

<i>That was 25 years ago.</i>

360
00:22:03.958 --> 00:22:05.416
<i>Well. just look at this list.</i>

<i>Do you see anybody on this list</i>
<i>that's won the Black &amp; Blue twice?</i>

00:22:10.041 --> 00:22:11.541
<i>Do you? Well. there's me.</i>

363
00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:17.000
<i>Hey. anybody in this room</i>
<i>won the Black &amp; Blue twice?</i>

364
00:22:17.083 --> 00:22:20.208
<i>What about anybody in this room</i>
<i>ever won it even once?</i>

365
00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:23.208
<i>Anybody in this room? Hmm?</i>

366
00:22:23.291 --> 00:22:25.916
<i>-No? No?</i>
<i>-Let's go see Quique about that pump.</i>

367
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.250
<i>-Come on.</i>
<i>-[Wade] Oh. that's odd.</i>

368
00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:29.916
<i>That makes me the only name on that list.</i>

369
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.083
<i>And you know why?</i>

370
00:22:31.166 --> 00:22:36.208
<i>Because I am the only person on the planet</i>
<i>to ever win it two years in a row.</i>

371
00:22:40.541 --> 00:22:42.291
<i>-Look. Biz…</i>
<i>-[sighs]</i>

372
00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:44.708
<i>[Wade] I know that we've had</i>
<i>our differences over the years.</i>

373
00:22:44.791 --> 00:22:46.791
<i>and I think I apologized</i>
<i>for the fireworks incident.</i>

374
00:22:46.875 --> 00:22:49.375
<i>-No. you didn't.</i>
<i>-Then well-- [grunts]</i>

375
00:22:49.458 --> 00:22:52.041
<i>We have always respected each other</i>
<i>as captains.</i>

376
00:22:52.125 --> 00:22:54.333
<i>And I'm gonna level with you.</i>

377
00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:58.625
<i>I… I have been a little down</i>
<i>on my luck lately. financially speaking.</i>

378
00:22:58.708 --> 00:23:02.625
<i>-and if you could just waive my entry fee…</i>
<i>-Wade--</i>

379
00:23:02.708 --> 00:23:04.958
<i>But I know</i>
<i>that if you bend the rules for me.</i>

380
00:23:05.041 --> 00:23:08.041
<i>you've gotta bend the rules</i>
<i>for every lawyer with a fishing boat.</i>

381
00:23:08.125 --> 00:23:10.416
<i>but let's get creative here.</i>

382
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:16.500
<i>What if you team me up</i>
<i>with a local fisherman so I can qualify?</i>

<i>Just. you know.</i>
<i>doesn't have to be anybody even good.</i>

<i>All right.</i>
<i>Now. once we get a fish on the line.</i>

<i>Why not?</i>

598

01:02:23.416 --> 01:02:24.833
<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

1116
01:02:24.916 --> 01:02:28.208
<i>[Moco] Okay. One. two. three.</i>
<i>Who can jump? Ooh! Ooh!</i>

1117
01:02:31.166 --> 01:02:33.333
<i>-Looks like you caught a big one today.</i>
<i>-[Omar] Yeah.</i>

1118
01:02:34.791 --> 01:02:36.791
<i>[kids laughing]</i>

1119
01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:44.375
<i>Mr. Bisbee called.</i>
<i>Told me to tell you no luck with the bank.</i>

1120
01:02:45.708 --> 01:02:46.541
<i>Okay.</i>

1121
01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:53.041
<i>And someone came by</i>
<i>and took pictures of the whole property.</i>

1122
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.416
<i>I'm not gonna lie. Omar.</i>

1123
01:02:58.041 --> 01:03:01.625
<i>The possibility of losing this place</i>
<i>in two weeks is starting to feel real now.</i>

1124
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.083
<i>[Tweety] Papa Omar.</i>

1125
01:03:12.708 --> 01:03:15.625
<i>-Oh. wow. </i>mijo!<i> This is awesome.</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

1126
01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:17.125
<i>It's Captain Wade.</i>

1127
01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:18.458
<i>[Omar] Yeah. I see that.</i>

1128
01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:20.625
<i>Did I spell it right? Becca helped.</i>

1129
01:03:20.708 --> 01:03:22.250
<i>Yeah. you did.</i>

1130
01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:24.125
<i>[laughs]</i>

1131
01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:26.666
<i>Can you nail it above my door tonight?</i>

1132
01:03:28.625 --> 01:03:30.333
<i>-Yeah. of course.</i>
<i>-[Tweety chuckles]</i>

1133
01:03:30.416 --> 01:03:32.500
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-[Omar] You're welcome.</i>

1134
01:03:37.458 --> 01:03:38.750
<i>[Becca] Okay. boys. Time to bed.</i>

1135
01:03:38.833 --> 01:03:41.666
<i>Group one. you have five minutes</i>
<i>to get your teeth brushed</i>

1136
01:03:42.458 --> 01:03:44.291
<i>with toothpaste. okay?</i>

1137
01:03:54.416 --> 01:03:55.333
<i>[knocking]</i>

1138
01:03:55.416 --> 01:03:57.083
<i>-[Wade] What?</i>
<i>-Captain Wade.</i>

1139
01:03:58.041 --> 01:03:59.333
<i>It's me. Omar.</i>

1140
01:03:59.416 --> 01:04:00.625
<i>[Wade] What do you want?</i>

1141
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:02.500
<i>Brought you some dinner.</i>

1142
01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:04.541
<i>[Wade] Come in.</i>

1143
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:09.708
<i>Take a seat.</i>

1144
01:04:09.791 --> 01:04:13.125
<i>This is a torta ahogada.</i>
<i>It's an old hangover remedy--</i>

1145
01:04:13.208 --> 01:04:16.833
<i>Whoever said that "a bad day of fishing</i>
<i>was better than a good day at home"</i>

1146
01:04:16.916 --> 01:04:18.625
<i>didn't have a day like today.</i>

1147
01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:22.250
<i>Hey. look. sorry about the lure.</i>

1148
01:04:22.333 --> 01:04:25.416
<i>I… I know that it meant--</i>
<i>Adeline. That's what you called it. right?</i>

1149
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.833
<i>Yeah. Adeline. that was my wife's name.</i>

1150
01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:29.166
<i>[smacks lips]</i>

1151
01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:31.625
<i>It was my son's idea. [scoffs]</i>

1152
01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:35.166
<i>The last time you saw 'em?</i>

1153
01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.916
<i>October 28. 2009.</i>

1154
01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:40.750
<i>They were on their way to Dallas.</i>

1155
01:04:41.583 --> 01:04:43.291
<i>Do you ever think about going after 'em?</i>

1156
01:04:43.375 --> 01:04:45.416
<i>Well. there was a day left</i>
<i>in the tournament.</i>

1157
01:04:47.166 --> 01:04:48.250
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1158
01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:49.791
<i>Yeah. [chuckles]</i>

1159
01:04:50.708 --> 01:04:52.625
<i>You think I'm a terrible father.</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

1160
01:04:52.708 --> 01:04:54.000
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-[Wade] Yeah. you do.</i>

1161
01:04:54.083 --> 01:04:56.125
<i>No. No. no. Look.</i>

1162
01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:59.875
<i>I think that we're all just trying</i>
<i>to do the best that we can. you know?</i>

1163
01:04:59.958 --> 01:05:02.500
<i>But look. I'm gonna be honest with you.</i>
<i>I think Geco's right.</i>

1164
01:05:02.583 --> 01:05:07.291
<i>You know. like. kids. they don't need</i>
<i>a father with fishing trophies.</i>

1165
01:05:07.875 --> 01:05:11.000
<i>They need a father</i>
<i>that's gonna be with them every day.</i>

1166
01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:13.833
<i>No matter what. Like an anchor.</i>

1167
01:05:14.625 --> 01:05:16.291
<i>"Anchor." That's really clever.</i>

1168
01:05:16.375 --> 01:05:17.208
<i>Mmm.</i>

1169
01:05:17.791 --> 01:05:20.000
<i>Yeah. well. my son… [clears throat]</i>

1170
01:05:21.125 --> 01:05:22.833
<i>…he wanted to be just like me.</i>

1171
01:05:23.916 --> 01:05:26.041
<i>First time I brought home</i>
<i>that Black &amp; Blue trophy.</i>

1172
01:05:26.125 --> 01:05:27.875
<i>he just thought I walked on water.</i>

1173
01:05:28.375 --> 01:05:31.166
<i>And she was like butter in my hands.</i>

1174
01:05:32.375 --> 01:05:33.625
<i>Just easy.</i>

1175
01:05:34.791 --> 01:05:39.416
<i>She used to call me.</i>
<i>"Oh. Captain. My Captain."</i>

1176
01:05:41.041 --> 01:05:42.708
<i>And then I lost.</i>

1177
01:05:42.791 --> 01:05:45.375
<i>I lost again. lost again.</i>

1178
01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.125
<i>And then I lost everything.</i>

1179
01:05:50.541 --> 01:05:52.500
<i>So. this was my shot.</i>

1180
01:05:53.333 --> 01:05:54.333
<i>You know?</i>

1181
01:05:55.208 --> 01:05:57.000
<i>Chance to be a champion again.</i>

1182
01:05:59.291 --> 01:06:01.250
<i>I thought if I could pull it off.</i>

1183
01:06:02.416 --> 01:06:03.833
<i>I'd be Mr. Wonderful.</i>

1184
01:06:05.458 --> 01:06:07.333
<i>Maybe they'd come back. Who knows?</i>

1185
01:06:07.916 --> 01:06:09.416
<i>[Omar] That doesn't sound crazy.</i>

1186
01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:13.083
<i>But if we're gonna have a shot.</i>
<i>you gotta get something in your stomach.</i>

1187
01:06:13.166 --> 01:06:14.125
<i>[Wade] Oh.</i>

1188
01:06:14.208 --> 01:06:15.833
<i>We don't have another shot.</i>

1189
01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:17.791
<i>Lightning doesn't strike twice.</i>

1190
01:06:17.875 --> 01:06:20.041
<i>-Come on. You don't know that.</i>
<i>-Yeah. Yes. I do.</i>

1191
01:06:20.125 --> 01:06:21.125
<i>No. you don't.</i>

1192
01:06:21.208 --> 01:06:24.416
<i>Look. I was skeptical</i>
<i>about this whole thing.</i>

1193
01:06:25.083 --> 01:06:28.291
<i>but then I see that marlin on the line.</i>
<i>and I… [sighs]</i>

1194
01:06:29.791 --> 01:06:32.750
<i>I don't know. Just. crazy things happen</i>
<i>all the time. right?</i>

1195
01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:33.666
<i>[grunts]</i>

1196
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:36.541
<i>Look. we never dreamed</i>
<i>of being in the Bisbee.</i>

1197
01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:39.916
<i>-The bank's got us by the throat. and--</i>
<i>-What bank? What bank?</i>

1198
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.208
<i>[grunts. sighs]</i>

1199
01:06:41.291 --> 01:06:42.625
<i>-Nothing.</i>
<i>-[Wade] Wait--</i>

1200
01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:45.875
<i>-No. Look. I'm not trying to pressure you.</i>
<i>-Oh no. You're not.</i>

1201
01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:46.791
<i>[Omar] What?</i>

1202
01:06:46.875 --> 01:06:50.041
<i>Are you… Are you using this tournament</i>
<i>to save your orphanage?</i>

1203
01:06:50.125 --> 01:06:52.916
<i>-That's exactly what's going on here.</i>
<i>-Look. I'm just… Look--</i>

1204
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.958
<i>Oh. don't you put that guilt on me.</i>

1205
01:06:55.041 --> 01:06:57.166
<i>Okay. look.</i>
<i>I… I know that tomorrow's a long shot.</i>

1206
01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:58.416
<i>This is so screwed up.</i>

1207
01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.750
<i>All I'm trying to say is</i>
<i>that we still have a chance.</i>

1208
01:07:00.833 --> 01:07:02.583
<i>We never had a chance.</i>

1209
01:07:03.333 --> 01:07:04.458
<i>You might be right.</i>

1210
01:07:05.458 --> 01:07:07.250
<i>but we still have to try.</i>

1211
01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:09.208
<i>It's over.</i>

1212
01:07:19.208 --> 01:07:20.791
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

1213
01:07:21.708 --> 01:07:23.875
<i>One of the younger boys made this for you.</i>

1214

<i>Hello?</i>

1222
01:08:43.625 --> 01:08:44.625
<i>What's going on?</i>

1223
01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:57.750
<i>A local fisherman</i>
<i>caught this this morning.</i>

1224
01:08:57.833 --> 01:08:59.375
<i>He's not in the tournament.</i>

1225
01:09:00.083 --> 01:09:02.291
<i>He's gonna sell it to us</i>
<i>for a pretty good price.</i>

1226
01:09:02.375 --> 01:09:04.416
<i>What? Sell it to us? [chuckles] For what?</i>

1227
01:09:05.166 --> 01:09:07.833
<i>Well. this is a 270-pound blue marlin.</i>

1228
01:09:07.916 --> 01:09:09.916
<i>It's… It's not first place.</i>

1229
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.500
<i>but it's third place. maybe second.</i>

1230
01:09:12.583 --> 01:09:13.958
<i>That's really good money.</i>

1231
01:09:14.916 --> 01:09:17.958
<i>Wait. you… you wanna cheat? Why?</i>

1232
01:09:19.666 --> 01:09:21.625
<i>Well. you wanna win</i>
<i>this tournament. don't you?</i>

1233
01:09:22.666 --> 01:09:25.208
<i>This is how we do it.</i>
<i>There's no other way.</i>

1234
01:09:25.708 --> 01:09:26.750
<i>So look…</i>

1235
01:09:27.916 --> 01:09:30.291
<i>[sighs] …when you get to the dock</i>
<i>with the boys.</i>

1236
01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:32.625
<i>this fish is gonna be</i>
<i>all wrapped up already.</i>

1237
01:09:32.708 --> 01:09:36.375
<i>and it's gonna be tied under the boat</i>
<i>at the back just under the water. okay?</i>

1238
01:09:36.458 --> 01:09:39.458
<i>Nobody's gonna see it</i>
<i>unless they're looking for it.</i>

1239
01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.208
<i>And then. when we get out to sea.</i>

1240
01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:45.708
<i>you're gonna help me</i>
<i>put this fish on our lines</i>

1241
01:09:45.791 --> 01:09:47.625
<i>so that one of the boys can reel it in.</i>

1242
01:09:47.708 --> 01:09:50.583
<i>Wait. Me? But--</i>
<i>Does Chato know about this?</i>

1243
01:09:50.666 --> 01:09:54.958
<i>Chato… Chato doesn't really approve.</i>
<i>but he knows it's for a good cause.</i>

1244
01:09:55.041 --> 01:09:57.708
<i>He's gonna help us distract the boys.</i>

1245
01:09:57.791 --> 01:09:59.708
<i>Oh. Okay. Look. man. I…</i>

1246
01:10:01.333 --> 01:10:02.583
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1247
01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:06.291
<i>I didn't mean to tell you about the bank.</i>
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pressure you.</i>

1248
01:10:06.375 --> 01:10:10.458
<i>But… But this isn't the only way. I mean.</i>
<i>dude. you won this thing twice in a row.</i>

1249
01:10:10.541 --> 01:10:13.916
<i>-Okay? No. If anybody can do it. you can--</i>
<i>-Omar. Omar. I cheated.</i>

1250
01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:16.166
<i>I cheated.</i>

1251
01:10:16.916 --> 01:10:17.750
<i>What?</i>

1252
01:10:17.833 --> 01:10:20.041
<i>The second time that I won.</i>

1253
01:10:21.125 --> 01:10:22.833
<i>this is what I did.</i>

1254
01:10:25.958 --> 01:10:28.625
<i>You won it once before. right?</i>

1255
01:10:30.708 --> 01:10:32.708
<i>-That means something. right?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1256
01:10:33.708 --> 01:10:35.125
<i>Some days it does.</i>

1257
01:10:37.583 --> 01:10:38.708
<i>Most days…</i>

1258
01:10:39.791 --> 01:10:41.208
<i>I don't know. I don't know.</i>

1259
01:10:41.291 --> 01:10:43.291
<i>Look. I can't do this without you.</i>

1260
01:10:43.833 --> 01:10:47.500
<i>So if you wanna back out.</i>
<i>you gotta give me the word right now.</i>

1261
01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:49.916
<i>But if you wanna save those boys.</i>

1262
01:10:50.916 --> 01:10:52.458
<i>this is what you gotta do.</i>

1263
01:10:52.541 --> 01:10:54.125

This isn't for little kids.

<i>It's okay. God told me to come.</i>

1274

<i>Thank you. Captain Wade and Chato</i>
<i>for bringing us out here.</i>

<i>The reality is that</i>

<i>and you… you do the right thing</i>
<i>every chance that you get.</i>

<i>You take the hard paths.</i>
<i>you make all the right sacrifices.</i>

1354

<i>you find that you're just standing</i>
<i>in the same place.</i>
