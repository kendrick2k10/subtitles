It's just taunting

Why are you doing this?

You mean by spending
all of your time

big choice coming up.

a way for you

460
00:35:19.073 --> 00:35:20.596
to not have to
make that choice?

appealing to you?

So?

465
00:35:32.173 --> 00:35:34.958
So. all you have to do
is answer three questions.

466
00:35:34.958 --> 00:35:36.743
That's it.

467
00:35:36.743 --> 00:35:38.353
If you get them right.
then I'll stop this whole thing

and let everyone go.

But if you get
one wrong.

470
00:35:42.792 --> 00:35:47.928
then you have to make a choice
between Nicole...
