00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:45.416

173
00:08:50.708 --> 00:08:51.958
Yes!

174
00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:53.208
Questions?

175
00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:54.833
No? No questions.

176
00:08:54.916 --> 00:08:57.041
So… [clears throat] …I'm so excited.

177
00:08:57.125 --> 00:09:00.750
This year we have some 12-year-olds
joining our high school class.

178
00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:03.583
We have Prim Patel. Did I say that right?

179
00:09:03.666 --> 00:09:05.583
It's. uh. Prem. like name.

180

-Perfect.

184
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.375
Okeydokey. And we have Claire Beauséjour.

185
00:09:13.458 --> 00:09:17.583
You two are the only junior high students
who passed the entrance exam.

186
00:09:17.666 --> 00:09:19.208
You must be quite the dynamic duo.

187
00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:20.875
-Affirmative.
-Yep.

188
00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.375
[Ms. Sage]
Well. who knows what time it is?

189
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:26.250
It's time for our first math quiz!

190
00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:27.333
[chuckles]

191
00:09:27.416 --> 00:09:30.666
Oh. and listen. for those of you
who are worried about grades.

192
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.041
I make a deal with all of my classes.

193
00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:34.833
Does anyone from last year remember?

194
00:09:34.916 --> 00:09:35.958
Anyone?

195
00:09:36.041 --> 00:09:37.541
You know. my deal that I make?

196

[grunts] Mercedes?

197
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.291
If the Mathlympics team
finishes in the top three.

198
00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:45.250
everyone on it gets an automatic A.

199
00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:48.416
That's right.
It was so much fun last year. by the way.

200
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.208
-Ma'am. we got destroyed. Like. dead last.
-Winning isn't everything.

201
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:53.750
Unless you need that A. right?
You literally just said--

202
00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:56.625
This is our year.
because we're hosting the event.

I rented a disco ball! [chuckles]

204
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:02.333
Dope. Do we still get to eat
at Olive Garden after we lose?

205
00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:07.083
Uh. well. this year… [chuckles] …um.
our budget includes Taco Bell.

206
00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:09.250
-Is that as punishment?
-No. no. Now. no.

207
00:10:09.333 --> 00:10:11.083
You don't have to write this down.

208
00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:16.291
Okay. On your marks. get set. solve!

Okay. everybody.
for your first homework assignment.

212
00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:59.333
what I want you to do is write an equation
with you as the solution. Okay?

213
00:10:59.416 --> 00:11:02.458
And then you work backwards
to show how all the elements of your life

214
00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:03.541
make up who you are.

215
00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:07.000
It's gonna be so much fun. So. really.
have a lot of fun with it. Okay?

216
00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.750
And you might even surprise yourself.

They need one more in their dance crew

Ronda was measuring a diuretic
for a patient.

297
00:14:36.416 --> 00:14:39.708
and she was using deciliters
instead of cubic centimeters.

298
00:14:39.791 --> 00:14:42.250
I was like.
"Honey. he's gonna pee forever."

-What was he known for?
-Known for?

317
00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:30.000
-I mean. was he smart?
-Definitely. but he wasn't a math guy.

I don't really know how to help.

What's the Leopard Lounge?

328
00:16:00.916 --> 00:16:02.458
It's the club where we met.

329
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:04.666
-Like a dance club?
-A hip-hop club.

330
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.458
Your father had a real way with words.

331

"The world's best never rest"?

Mom. that is so cool.

334

He was…

336
00:16:20.416 --> 00:16:22.208
one of the best I've ever seen.

337
00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:25.958
I wish you could've seen him.

338
00:16:32.416 --> 00:16:36.333
Sometimes I forget how he looked
and how he sounded.

339
00:16:43.541 --> 00:16:44.541
Okay. [chuckles]

340
00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:49.541

we used to go dancing on the weekends.

341
00:16:50.125 --> 00:16:53.708
My girlfriends told me about this place.
It was poppin'.

342
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.958
[mother] And the Leopard Lounge had
this thing called Freestyle Tuesdays.

343
00:17:03.041 --> 00:17:04.375
You said you only went on weekends.

344
00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:06.541
Well. some Tuesdays. Not if we had exams.

345
00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:08.250
I don't need to explain myself.

346
00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:09.791
Anyway. you were at the club.

347
00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:12.333
We were at the club.
and my girlfriends were saying…

348
00:17:12.416 --> 00:17:14.791
This emcee's an underground legend.

349
00:17:14.875 --> 00:17:16.750
-Blah. blah. blah. blah.
-Blah. blah.

350
00:17:16.833 --> 00:17:18.291
-Blah. blah. [chuckles]
-Why are they…

351
00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:19.583
I wasn't really listening.

352
00:17:19.666 --> 00:17:23.083
-Blah. blah. blah.
-Blah. blah. blah. blah.

353
00:17:23.166 --> 00:17:25.708
I had a lot on my mind. like school--

354
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:27.958
Priya. stop thinking about Doug. Okay?

355
00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:29.958
It's over. He's not even that cute.

356
00:17:30.041 --> 00:17:31.375
Who's Doug?

357
00:17:31.458 --> 00:17:33.458
Who? I don't know.
I can't really remember--

358
00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:36.666
Good thing we stopped you
from getting that tattoo of his name. huh?

359
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.666
We literally saved your butt.

360
00:17:50.208 --> 00:17:52.708
[friend 1] Hey. girl.
We'll go grab our drinks.

361
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.291

My name's Suresh.

366
00:18:14.625 --> 00:18:16.208
-I'm not interested.

-Okay. [chuckles]
-That's what you said to Dad?

368
00:18:18.666 --> 00:18:20.375
I didn't feel like being hit on.

369
00:18:20.458 --> 00:18:22.291
-Would you like to have a drink?
-No.

370
00:18:22.375 --> 00:18:24.708
I don't drink anything ever.

371
00:18:24.791 --> 00:18:26.750
-Then why are you in a nightclub?
-Thank you. Bye.

372
00:18:26.833 --> 00:18:28.333
I wanna walk away. I really do.

373
00:18:28.416 --> 00:18:30.708
-Please do.
-Yes. You've set a clear boundary.

374
00:18:30.791 --> 00:18:33.583
The only problem is
you're the prettiest girl in the room.

375
00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:35.958
-Oh?
-And I just have this thing inside of me

376
00:18:36.041 --> 00:18:37.833
that also tells me that
you're the smartest.

377
00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:41.125
Like you probably got a--
What. 1550 on the SATs?

-I went low so that I--
-How did you know I was smart?

381
00:18:46.416 --> 00:18:50.000
I could tell from your footwear.
'cause it's very sensible for a nightclub.

382
00:18:50.083 --> 00:18:51.666
-Also. if it gets cold…
-[Priya] Uh-huh.

change your mind about that drink--

-Don't hold your breath.
-You remind me of my mother.

[bartender]
That's your dad doing his thing.

1259

Oh. I know. [chuckles]

1261
01:02:14.166 --> 01:02:16.208
We worked together for five years.

1262
01:02:16.708 --> 01:02:18.541
He talked a better game than anyone.

1263
01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:21.250
And his favorite thing
to talk about was hip-hop.

1264

1277
01:02:50.625 --> 01:02:52.041
Suresh had big dreams.

1278
01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:54.333
The way he talked about it.
it was like he was his own hype man.

1279
01:02:54.416 --> 01:02:55.708
All right. grumpy. Here you go.

1280
01:02:55.791 --> 01:02:57.541

after work with the fellas.

-He had skills.
-But what happened?

[Corey] Well. nothing happened.

1298
