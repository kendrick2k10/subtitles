3
00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:32.916
Ikal!

4
00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:14.000
WHERE THE TRACKS END

5
00:01:27.083 --> 00:01:30.375
If you want to be one of us.
you must pass the test. okay?

6
00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:33.958
Why are you stopping?
Are you afraid. or what?

7
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.125
I'm not afraid.

8
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:38.500
I don't know if it's a good idea.

9
00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:46.750
I think I see him.

10
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.208
Go.

11
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.875
My grandma once told me
that the spirits of some dead people

12
00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.583
stay here wandering.

13
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:08.041
Don't believe your grandma.

14
00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:09.500
Are you afraid of the dead?

15
00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:11.375
I'm more afraid of the living.

16
00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:14.916
Did you hear that?

17
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.875
What?

18
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:18.958
-A noise.
-No. it's Tuerto's belly.

19
00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:21.125
I don't want a dead person to chase me.

20
00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:23.958
Nobody will chase us
because we don't even know if he's dead.

21
00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:25.458
Did you hear that?

22
00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:26.708
Come on. Poke him.

23
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:28.791
Leave him alone. Chico!

24
00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:45.708
He's dead.

25
00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:50.333
Hey!

26
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.333
I'm your friend.

27
00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:07.833
Was he your owner?

28
00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:15.125
Wanna be my friend?

29
00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:18.250
Miss. I swear he was dead.

30
00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:20.458
Yes. but don't pull me
or you'll make me fall.

31
00:03:20.541 --> 00:03:22.541
What if the new kid was eaten?

32
00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:24.541
And who's supposed to eat whom?

33
00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:26.083
Well. the monster.

34
00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:27.583
Okay. Calm down.

35
00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.416
Breathe. Just breathe.

36
00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:33.750
Tell me. what did you find?

37
00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:35.458
A dead person or a monster?

38
00:03:35.541 --> 00:03:36.708
A dead person.

39
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:39.291
but we were walking
and a monster appeared.

40
00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:41.625
And where's the new kid? Or who is he?

41
00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:44.208
That's him. miss. There he is!

42
00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:46.875
He shruvived!

43
00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.500
The right word is "survived." Tuerto.

44
00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:50.666
Oh.

45
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.500
So that's the new kid.

46
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:55.250
Thank you. Robertito.

47
00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.291
-See you later. miss.
-Okay. kids.

48
00:03:57.375 --> 00:03:58.208
POLICE

49
00:03:58.291 --> 00:04:01.458
The officer says that.
apparently. he was homeless.

50
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.916
They'll investigate who he is.

51
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.083
and then they can tell the family.

52
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:08.083
What's the new one called?

53
00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:09.208
Ikal Machuca.

54
00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:10.875
Nice to meet you.

55
00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:13.208
Did you come with the workers?

56
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:14.125
Yes.

57
00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:17.541
-And when will you go to school?
-I don't know. Is there a school?

58
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.625
Of course there is.

59
00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:24.333
And in this town.
all kids must go to school.

60
00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:44.250
Do you want a cigarette?

61
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.625
Good evening. Bety.

62
00:05:04.416 --> 00:05:05.750
Good evening.

63
00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:09.791
Good evening. miss.

64
00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:11.375
Good evening. gentlemen.

65
00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.041
-Dad.
-Ikal.

66
00:05:16.708 --> 00:05:18.791
Where were you. son? Huh?

67
00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:20.041
Miss Georgina.

68
00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:21.791
Good evening. sir.

69
00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:23.208
I am Miss Georgina.

70
00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:26.750
I swear. Dad.

71
00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:29.583
He came to me. He adopted me.

72
00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:30.500
Yeah.

73
00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:33.000
Oh. son. you and your nonsense.

74
00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.583
But you told me to go out
and make friends.

75
00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:38.625
Yes. but I didn't tell you
to go find a dead person.

76
00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:41.083
You haven't told me
what grade you're in. Ikal.

77
00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:42.500
I don't know.

78
00:05:43.416 --> 00:05:44.833
What do you mean?

79
00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:46.625
Well. we travel a lot.

80
00:05:46.708 --> 00:05:49.416
There aren't any schools
at the places where we go. right?

81
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.250
Just send him to me
and I'll see what level he's at.

82
00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:53.791
Can you read?

83
00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:54.708
Well.

84
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:57.000
some letters. drawings.

85
00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:58.875
How old is this child?

86
00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:03.625
It's imperative for him
to acquire some skills at this age.

87
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.375
I'll send him to school tomorrow. miss.

88
00:06:06.458 --> 00:06:08.416
Oh. I don't want to go to school.

89
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.708
You'll do what the teacher
and your mom say. okay?

90
00:06:11.791 --> 00:06:14.541
-And if I'm asked to do something bad?
-Oh. God.

91
00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:17.250
Don't start with that.
And say goodbye to that dog.

92
00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:19.083
Here you go. miss.

93
00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:21.750
-It looks delicious. Thanks.
-I hope you like it.

94
00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:28.416
Are you okay. ma'am?

95
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.625
These last few days she's been a bit sick.

96
00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:33.458
but she's improving.

97
00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:37.166
No. miss. Everything is fine.

98
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.083
Ikal and my husband
take good care of me. right?

99
00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.416
-Quetzal can also take care of you.
-Oh. son.

100
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.458
The doctor said
that we can't have animals at home.

101
00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:50.125
I promise you
that we'll have a dog someday.

102
00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:55.416
But why can't I be like the other kids?

103
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.166
We're always moving around.
from town to town. like grasshoppers.

104
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.833
And when I finally find a true friend.
you don't let me keep him.

105
00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:05.833
-It isn't fair.
-Who said life was fair?

106
00:07:05.916 --> 00:07:08.833
If it isn't fair.
why can't you let me have a dog?

107
00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:11.250
I apologize for interrupting.

108
00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:14.750
but if you let Ikal keep the dog.

109
00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:17.375
it can sleep at the school at night.

110
00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:19.958
And don't worry about the food.
I'll take care of it.

111
00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:22.958
As long as this child learns to read.

112
00:07:23.791 --> 00:07:26.458
-Thank you. miss.
-Look at that smile.

113
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:29.541
I'd never seen someone so happy
about learning to read.

114
00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:32.833
-Well. I'll have a dog.
-No. young man. not yet.

115
00:07:33.541 --> 00:07:35.541
Your parents haven't agreed yet.

116
00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:37.666
Please.

117
00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:42.333
Okay.

118
00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:45.416
You can keep the dog.

119
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.250
But only if you eat up your tamales

120
00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:49.625
before they get cold.

121
00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:51.500
Quetzal!

122
00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:54.583
Come on.

123
00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:57.125
Come on.

124
00:08:01.708 --> 00:08:03.250
-Hello.
-Hello.

125
00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:05.416
-Hello.
-Are you keeping him?

126
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.875
Yes. he's mine.

127
00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.166
But the teacher will let him sleep here.

128
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.458
Good morning.

129
00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:12.708
Good morning. kids.

130
00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:16.000
-Which is my classroom?
-This is the whole school. silly. Come.

131
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.458
Welcome. Ikal.

132
00:08:18.541 --> 00:08:19.375
Thank you.

133
00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:20.708
You stay here.

134
00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:23.375
And to the north. we have the Rio Grande.

135
00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:25.250
Let's see.

136
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:28.583
Who can tell me something
about this river?

137
00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:29.750
Me.

138
00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:31.500
Okay. What can you tell me. Diana?

139
00:08:31.583 --> 00:08:34.458
It's the one you have to cross
to have a wet back.

140
00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:35.958
Yes.

141
00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:37.875
Yes. Diana is right.

142
00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.625
The Short Kids sit at the front.

143
00:08:39.708 --> 00:08:42.958
Piolín. "Dynamite" Dianita. and Carola.

144
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:45.958
Do you want my advice?
Don't mess with them. They're terrible.

145
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:47.458
Oh. and also Juani.

146
00:08:48.208 --> 00:08:49.750
He's Tuerto's little brother.

147
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.500
What group do I belong to?

148
00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:53.500
You'll be one of the Bald Kids.

149
00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:56.250
Along with Chesco. Tuerto. Uriel.

150
00:08:56.333 --> 00:08:58.000
Olivia. and Lupe.

151
00:08:58.083 --> 00:09:00.625
-Why are they bald?
-Because they have lice.

152
00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.875
And all the way back. the Dirt Poor--

153
00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:03.958
The "Dirt Poor"?

154
00:09:04.583 --> 00:09:07.500
Valeria. please come to the blackboard

155
00:09:07.583 --> 00:09:11.000
and tell me which is
the most important river in our state.

156
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.583
-Go.
-Yes. miss.

157
00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:39.750
What wonderful river

158
00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:42.833
did your mind go flying to. Ikal?

159
00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:44.583
If you want to learn.

160
00:09:44.666 --> 00:09:47.666
you have to pay attention to your lessons.

161
00:09:48.833 --> 00:09:49.750
Let's see.

162
00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:54.041
Can you read that?

163
00:09:54.833 --> 00:09:55.666
Read.

164
00:09:57.333 --> 00:09:58.291
"The…"

165
00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:00.958
All right.

166
00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.375
Come to see me after class. Understood?

167
00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:07.333
Understood?

168
00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.166
-Answer when someone asks a question.
-Yes. miss.

169
00:10:13.916 --> 00:10:15.916
-Hey. do you want to play?
-Yes.

170
00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:20.291
PLEASE THROW THE GARBAGE IN THE CAN

171
00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:21.291
-Hi.
-Hi.

172
00:10:21.375 --> 00:10:23.083
-Do you want one?
-Yes. thanks.

173
00:10:23.166 --> 00:10:25.500
-You're welcome.
-What group are you in?

174
00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.916
Us? We're the Dirt Poor.

175
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.250
Are you going to start? That's not true.

176
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.958
We'll be dirt poor like our parents

177
00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:34.875
and like our grandparents.

178
00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:36.625
Why do you say that?

179
00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:40.583
Maybe you think otherwise.
but your family has land.

180
00:10:40.666 --> 00:10:42.083
Mine has nothing.

181
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.541
They work for whatever the damn boss
wants to give them.

182
00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:48.208
Look. I'll be a locomotive driver

183
00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:50.000
at Union Pacific.

184
00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:53.125
And I'll go all around the world by train.

185
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:55.791
I will work at our ranch.

186
00:10:56.416 --> 00:11:00.750
I will cross the Rio Grande
and become a millionaire in the USA.

187
00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:02.166
Doing what?

188
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.125
I don't know.

189
00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:05.208
You don't even speak Spanish properly.

190
00:11:05.291 --> 00:11:07.958
I don't think you can learn English
just like that.

191
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:10.416
Idiot.

192
00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.250
What will you be when you grow up?

193
00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:16.958
Will you operate the train?

194
00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:18.666
I don't know.

195
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:21.791
I don't even know
what I'll do later today.

196
00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:24.125
I do know what you'll do.

197
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.250
You'll go with Miss Georgina.

198
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.208
…two. three.

199
00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:43.375
We have to reach 2.000
and make up for the lost time.

200
00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:47.958
The rain is coming
and this will get very tough.

201
00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.208
-I want no excuses. Get to work.
-My timber is heavier.

202
00:11:51.708 --> 00:11:53.291
I hadn't heard that one.

203
00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:55.250
You're gossiping a lot. Get to work.

204
00:11:56.041 --> 00:11:57.416
But he's the best boss.

205
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.583
Do you smoke?

206
00:12:04.041 --> 00:12:04.875
No.

207
00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:07.166
I blow smoke through my mouth.

208
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.166
Since you're new.
I'd like to clarify something.

209
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.875
If you're part of my gang.
you do what I say. Okay?

210
00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:16.416
I'm the boss.

211
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.833
I don't have a boss.

212
00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:20.958
You do. You'll see. Worm.

213
00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:23.958
I don't. You'll see.

214
00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:26.916
Quetzal!

215
00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:30.291
Come on.

216
00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:34.875
-How did it go. son?
-Fine.

217
00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.916
Yes? Are you happy?

218
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.041
-Yes.
-Oh.

219
00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:40.625
Hey. who was that guy. huh?

220
00:12:40.708 --> 00:12:41.875
Is he at your school?

221
00:12:42.375 --> 00:12:44.416
-He's one of the Dirt Poor.
-What?

222
00:12:44.916 --> 00:12:46.750
-One of the Older Kids.
-Oh.

223
00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:52.333
Well. be very careful with him. okay?

224
00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:55.375
Why?

225
00:12:56.791 --> 00:12:57.666
I don't know.

226
00:12:58.791 --> 00:12:59.833
It's a mom thing.

227
00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:29.541
Come on.

228
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:42.625
Who's there?

229
00:13:43.208 --> 00:13:44.041
It's me.

230
00:13:44.541 --> 00:13:45.375
The new kid.

231
00:13:46.208 --> 00:13:47.041
Ikal.

232
00:13:47.541 --> 00:13:48.375
Oh.

233
00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:50.958
Okay.

234
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.541
I was expecting you
20 minutes ago. young man.

235
00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:55.458
Sorry.

236
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:57.750
I told you that if you want to learn.

237
00:13:57.833 --> 00:13:59.625
you must be disciplined.

238
00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:01.541
Okay. do me a favor.

239
00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:03.916
Bring me that blue book in the corner.

240
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Yes. miss.

241
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.166
Is he your husband?

242
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.833
That's none of your business.

243
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.708
Do what I said.

244
00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:22.208
Sit down.

245
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:26.416
Okay.

246
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.458
Let's see.

247
00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:37.916
Here.

248
00:14:39.125 --> 00:14:40.333
Read this.

249
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.500
"This…"

250
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.708
"This is…"

251
00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:46.875
"This…"

252
00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.125
-Which is this one?
-Which one?

253
00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:50.083
This one.

254
00:14:51.708 --> 00:14:53.958
-B.
-Oh. yes. it's a B.

255
00:14:55.208 --> 00:14:56.041
B…

256
00:14:59.041 --> 00:14:59.875
"Bo…"

257
00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:01.625
"Bo…"

258
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.000
"Boc…"

259
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:05.666
I'm sorry.

260
00:15:09.583 --> 00:15:10.916
Why do you apologize?

261
00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:13.916
Because I can't read.

262
00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:17.250
Then what you have to do is study.

263
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.083
not apologize.

264
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.833
I want to see you here
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.

265
00:15:22.916 --> 00:15:24.541
Why would I want to read?

266
00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:26.666
Well. to know things.

267
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.500
To have fun.

268
00:15:28.583 --> 00:15:30.666
To use that head that God gave you.

269
00:15:31.166 --> 00:15:32.416
Reading is boring.

270
00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.125
How would you know that?

271
00:15:35.041 --> 00:15:36.000
I won't beg you.

272
00:15:37.083 --> 00:15:37.958
Look.

273
00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:41.166
if you don't want to learn.
don't make me waste my time.

274
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.291
-May I leave?
-Yes. go ahead.

275
00:15:44.166 --> 00:15:45.166
Hey. listen.

276
00:15:45.833 --> 00:15:47.125
I'll give you something.

277
00:15:58.833 --> 00:15:59.666
Kalimán!

278
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.500
I'll lend it to you on one condition.

279
00:16:03.208 --> 00:16:05.875
That you have to read it here
three times a week.

280
00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:06.875
Do you agree?

281
00:16:07.916 --> 00:16:09.083
-Yes.
-All right.

282
00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:11.250
-Thank you. miss.
-Okay.

283
00:16:11.875 --> 00:16:13.000
Come on. Quetzal.

284
00:16:17.583 --> 00:16:18.416
This kid.

285
00:16:21.708 --> 00:16:22.583
Martita.

286
00:16:24.125 --> 00:16:25.708
Good morning. Inspector.

287
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:27.875
-How is it good. Mirna?
-Oh.

288
00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.500
You're in a fighting mood.
Why are you so cheerful?

289
00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:32.875
Yes. Ha. ha. ha!

290
00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:33.791
Oh. God.

291
00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:38.041
-Good morning. sir.
-Good morning. Valenzuela.

292
00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:39.791
How are we doing. Valenzuela?

293
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:42.375
-We're doing good.
-I need you to step it up.

294
00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:44.875
Elections are near.
Let's make a good impression.

295
00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.875
-Yes. I know.
-Then move.

296
00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.625
Don't waste time.

297
00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:50.875
For today.

298
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.541
-What? That's it?
-Yes.

299
00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:55.916
Sure. Thank you.

300
00:17:06.083 --> 00:17:09.083
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION
INSPECTION OF SCHOOL DISTRICT 07B

301
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.458
All done?

302
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:15.375
How did it go?

303
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.125
Give me that.

304
00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:27.416
Do you want coffee?

305
00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:30.041
Yes. I'm beat.

306
00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:30.958
Ikal!

307
00:17:32.083 --> 00:17:33.125
Hi. Dad.

308
00:17:33.208 --> 00:17:34.250
What is that?

309
00:17:35.833 --> 00:17:36.750
What are you doing?

310
00:17:36.833 --> 00:17:39.958
Nothing. I'm just learning how to read.

311
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:41.458
But I'm quite dumb.

312
00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:42.958
Hey. no.

313
00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:44.875
Don't call yourself that. son.

314
00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:48.458
How's it going with the teacher?

315
00:17:51.375 --> 00:17:53.708
Look. son. I know it's hard to study

316
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:57.041
when you're constantly moving
from one place to another.

317
00:17:59.541 --> 00:18:01.083
It might not seem like it.

318
00:18:01.166 --> 00:18:03.166
but we're doing all this for you.

319
00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:05.041
You know that. right?

320
00:18:05.541 --> 00:18:06.458
Yes.

321
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:08.583
Now. a bit of homework.

322
00:18:08.666 --> 00:18:11.458
No!

323
00:18:11.541 --> 00:18:13.791
You woke up very grouchy today.

324
00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:16.333
Look. next week.

325
00:18:16.416 --> 00:18:19.500
I want the Short Kids
to bring me a plant or a flower.

326
00:18:19.583 --> 00:18:21.500
May I bring whatever I want?

327
00:18:21.583 --> 00:18:23.666
Sure. whatever you like. Very good.

328
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.000
And I want the Bald Kids
to bring me a bug.

329
00:18:27.083 --> 00:18:28.458
Ew!

330
00:18:28.541 --> 00:18:29.750
Why "ew"?

331
00:18:29.833 --> 00:18:32.375
But I want the bug alive
when it gets here.

332
00:18:32.458 --> 00:18:33.583
-All right?
-Miss?

333
00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:36.291
-Yes?
-And what are we bringing?

334
00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:39.833
A cow?
Because we don't even have hens at home.

335
00:18:40.833 --> 00:18:42.875
What I want the Older Kids to bring

336
00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.583
is a fruit or a vegetable.

337
00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:49.541
-Is the homework clear?
-Yes. miss!

338
00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:51.958
Okay. I don't want excuses.

339
00:18:52.583 --> 00:18:53.500
No…

340
00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.083
-Mr. Machuca.
-Yes. Mom?

341
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.791
Can you describe the homework for me?

342
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.208
Can you describe it?

343
00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:12.375
I need you to pay attention in class. sir!

344
00:19:12.458 --> 00:19:14.375
Find out what the homework is.

345
00:19:14.458 --> 00:19:16.416
And don't even think of coming without it.

346
00:19:17.625 --> 00:19:19.291
What's up. little snakes?

347
00:19:19.375 --> 00:19:21.916
Take out your notebooks. Let's do math.

348
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.666
No!

349
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.541
Oh. my God. These kids.

350
00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:29.166
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye.

351
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.583
-Quetzal.
-Goodbye.

352
00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:34.000
See you tomorrow.

353
00:19:34.083 --> 00:19:36.041
-Bye. brother.
-Sit.

354
00:19:36.125 --> 00:19:37.000
Sit.

355
00:19:38.458 --> 00:19:39.958
Quetzal. sit.

356
00:19:40.041 --> 00:19:42.875
I swear he does obey. Look. Quetzal. sit.

357
00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:44.750
Yes. he's very obedient.

358
00:19:45.666 --> 00:19:47.958
It's clear you won't be a teacher.

359
00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:50.500
And you won't be a wetback
because you can't even swim.

360
00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:51.500
Yes. I can.

361
00:19:51.583 --> 00:19:52.791
Not drowning is one thing.

362
00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:55.666
but swimming across the river
is totally different.

363
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.750
I could swim across the river.

364
00:19:57.833 --> 00:20:00.833
-Sure. since you are a worm…
-I can probably swim better than you.

365
00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:04.083
Wanna bet?

366
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.375
The loser
treats the whole gang to ice cream.

367
00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:12.875
I'll get a chocolate one.

368
00:20:15.416 --> 00:20:18.083
The first one
to reach the other side wins.

369
00:20:18.166 --> 00:20:19.375
And in dollars.

370
00:20:21.541 --> 00:20:24.458
Are you ready to cross
to the United States?

371
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.083
Are you sure you want to do this?

372
00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:31.541
You'll have to speak English
on the other side.

373
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.083
I'm ready.

374
00:20:33.583 --> 00:20:34.416
I'm ready.

375
00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:41.916
-Come on. swim!
-Swim!

376
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Swim!

377
00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:46.041
Swim!

378
00:20:47.208 --> 00:20:48.666
Swim!

379
00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:50.375
Swim!

380
00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.083
Come on!

381
00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:57.708
If you do that. you'll get shot!

382
00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:04.416
Come on! You can do it!

383
00:21:05.708 --> 00:21:06.875
You're a cheater!

384
00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:09.416
I won!

385
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.500
-I won!
-Yes!

386
00:21:10.583 --> 00:21:12.166
Welcome to America!

387
00:21:14.583 --> 00:21:16.166
I told you I was going to win.

388
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.083
Don't you have anything harder for me?

389
00:21:18.166 --> 00:21:19.333
It was really easy.

390
00:21:20.583 --> 00:21:22.541
He cheated. He pulled my foot.

391
00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:25.625
Don't be whiny. Worm. Be a good sport.

392
00:21:27.333 --> 00:21:29.250
Come on. Get out of the water.

393
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:30.958
He cheated.

394
00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:35.125
You have to pay your part of the bet.

395
00:21:35.208 --> 00:21:37.000
I don't pay cheaters.

396
00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:39.833
Please stop fighting.

397
00:21:39.916 --> 00:21:42.500
You're in the land of opportunity.

398
00:21:42.583 --> 00:21:45.416
It was just a reminder
of who the gang leader is.

399
00:21:46.125 --> 00:21:47.041
I'm leaving.

400
00:21:48.458 --> 00:21:49.416
Quetzal!

401
00:21:51.083 --> 00:21:52.291
Quetzal!

402
00:21:54.041 --> 00:21:55.000
Quetzal!

403
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:57.833
Quetzal!

404
00:21:57.916 --> 00:22:00.250
Damn dog. You're going to pay for this.

405
00:22:04.666 --> 00:22:06.041
Ikal Machuca!

406
00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:07.875
What happened?

407
00:22:08.416 --> 00:22:09.708
We were in the river

408
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.083
and suddenly--

409
00:22:11.166 --> 00:22:12.500
Where are your clothes?

410
00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:16.625
Don't be upset. Mom.

411
00:22:17.375 --> 00:22:19.333
I'm fine. Nothing happened to me.

412
00:22:19.833 --> 00:22:22.666
Ikal!

413
00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.208
Here.

414
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:29.208
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

415
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.416
I'll see you at school tomorrow.
See you later. ma'am.

416
00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:39.708
You're grounded.

417
00:22:43.125 --> 00:22:45.000
"Car… car…"

418
00:22:45.083 --> 00:22:46.166
"Care…"

419
00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:49.250
-"Carful."
-What does that mean?

420
00:22:49.875 --> 00:22:51.875
-I don't know.
-Then try again.

421
00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:57.541
Traitor.

422
00:22:58.583 --> 00:23:00.666
I don't want you to talk to me
or bark at me.

423
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.625
What happened?

424
00:23:01.708 --> 00:23:02.958
He betrayed me.

425
00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:06.416
How can he betray you if he's just a dog?
Don't get distracted. Go on.

426
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.458
Don't play the martyr.

427
00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:12.666
I told you to focus.

428
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:13.791
Keep going.

429
00:23:13.875 --> 00:23:14.708
Quetzal.

430
00:23:15.291 --> 00:23:18.083
"Car. care. careful. Kalimán."

431
00:23:18.166 --> 00:23:19.666
There you go!

432
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.083
That's what it says.

433
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.041
Inspector.

434
00:23:55.541 --> 00:23:57.625
-Sir.
-How nice to see you.

435
00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.583
Welcome.

436
00:24:04.916 --> 00:24:06.458
That's why it was said

437
00:24:06.541 --> 00:24:09.833
that they were the Sun's children.

438
00:24:09.916 --> 00:24:11.041
Excuse me. miss.

439
00:24:11.666 --> 00:24:12.500
Good morning.

440
00:24:14.958 --> 00:24:16.416
Good morning. Inspector.

441
00:24:17.583 --> 00:24:18.458
Children.

442
00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:20.000
"Good morning."

443
00:24:20.083 --> 00:24:22.708
Good morning.

444
00:24:25.125 --> 00:24:26.250
Xalapa. Veracruz.

445
00:24:26.333 --> 00:24:27.666
Xalapa. Veracruz.

446
00:24:28.375 --> 00:24:29.541
Villahermosa. Tabasco.

447
00:24:29.625 --> 00:24:31.625
Villahermosa. Tabasco.

448
00:24:32.291 --> 00:24:33.208
Mérida…

449
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:34.500
Mérida. Yucatán.

450
00:24:35.333 --> 00:24:36.875
La Paz. Baja California.

451
00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:38.916
La Paz. Baja California.

452
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.958
Hugo.

453
00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.666
Kids. hold on a minute.

454
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.166
As long as we optimize the resources.

455
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.625
we'll reach more children
throughout Mexico.

456
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.125
Do you know how many people
depend on this little school?

457
00:24:56.875 --> 00:24:59.208
And that way. we intend to improve

458
00:24:59.291 --> 00:25:01.291
the current educational system.

459
00:25:01.916 --> 00:25:02.750
Modernize it.

460
00:25:02.833 --> 00:25:04.541
I cannot accept this.

461
00:25:05.583 --> 00:25:08.875
The director general
needs to come. to see these children.

462
00:25:08.958 --> 00:25:12.458
and realize we need more schools
instead of closing down this one.

463
00:25:12.541 --> 00:25:13.583
What is this?

464
00:25:13.666 --> 00:25:16.500
A notice for the closing down
of the school. miss.

465
00:25:16.583 --> 00:25:18.125
No. that's not possible. I mean…

466
00:25:18.708 --> 00:25:20.208
How do I tell the parents?

467
00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:21.500
It's for the greater good…

468
00:25:21.583 --> 00:25:23.458
"For the greater good." my ass!

469
00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:26.083
Not even you believe that!

470
00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:28.875
-You don't need to--
-If you're done. why don't you leave?

471
00:25:28.958 --> 00:25:30.291
Believe me. I'm not--

472
00:25:30.375 --> 00:25:33.375
-Please.
-I don't like giving bad news.

473
00:25:34.208 --> 00:25:35.875
What will happen to the children?

474
00:25:36.416 --> 00:25:38.250
Use this time to prepare them.

475
00:25:40.083 --> 00:25:42.625
When did you stop believing in children?

476
00:25:44.375 --> 00:25:48.208
When did you stop believing in teaching?

477
00:25:56.958 --> 00:25:57.916
Ikal.

478
00:26:03.625 --> 00:26:04.458
Ikal.

479
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.041
Come on. son. Wake up.
You're running really late.

480
00:26:16.125 --> 00:26:16.958
Come on.

481
00:26:17.458 --> 00:26:18.958
Come on. Get up.

482
00:26:19.541 --> 00:26:21.625
Wash your face. The water is ready.

483
00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:26.416
Look.

484
00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:29.250
Your clothes are ready as well.

485
00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.458
Don't get wet. Ikal.

486
00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:34.250
I don't want you to get sick.

487
00:26:35.875 --> 00:26:38.583
By the way.
someone is waiting for you outside.

488
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:50.791
-Behave and do your best.
-Yes. Mom.

489
00:26:50.875 --> 00:26:51.791
Quetzal!

490
00:26:52.791 --> 00:26:53.666
Come on.

491
00:26:56.833 --> 00:26:58.541
Now I can trust you.

492
00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:02.541
"And. that way…

493
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:05.291
Kalimán

494
00:27:05.375 --> 00:27:09.041
got ready for his nex…

495
00:27:09.125 --> 00:27:13.250
next adventure."

496
00:27:13.333 --> 00:27:14.208
"The end."

497
00:27:14.291 --> 00:27:15.125
Shake my hand.

498
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.083
Congratulations. young man.

499
00:27:18.583 --> 00:27:21.541
You just managed to read your first book.

500
00:27:21.625 --> 00:27:22.541
Very good.

501
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:29.000
Do you really enjoy reading. miss?

502
00:27:29.083 --> 00:27:30.541
I love it.

503
00:27:31.083 --> 00:27:31.958
But

504
00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:36.000
the day will come. sooner than later.

505
00:27:36.833 --> 00:27:39.083
when I won't be able to read anything.

506
00:27:42.708 --> 00:27:44.000
I have cataracts.

507
00:27:44.583 --> 00:27:46.208
Lots of water in your eyes?

508
00:27:47.875 --> 00:27:49.000
No.

509
00:27:49.541 --> 00:27:51.291
Not that kind of cataracts.

510
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.333
No.

511
00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:56.958
This is a disease.

512
00:27:57.041 --> 00:27:59.166
And it's progressing very fast.

513
00:27:59.708 --> 00:28:01.125
It gets worse every day.

514
00:28:01.208 --> 00:28:02.041
Oh. well.

515
00:28:03.958 --> 00:28:06.375
So. the day will come

516
00:28:06.458 --> 00:28:07.958
when I won't be able to read.

517
00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:10.958
and then.
the day when I won't see anything.

518
00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:15.625
I will read to you all the Kalimán books
that you want. miss.

519
00:28:15.708 --> 00:28:16.583
I promise.

520
00:28:20.125 --> 00:28:21.458
Thank you. Ikal.

521
00:28:23.833 --> 00:28:27.916
Have you ever thought of
what you'd like to be when you grow up?

522
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:29.916
No.

523
00:28:31.541 --> 00:28:34.500
With your imagination.
you could do lots of things.

524
00:28:35.166 --> 00:28:37.166
But I get distracted easily.

525
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.375
Well. we're all different.

526
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.000
My son was like you.

527
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.583
So. you just need to be more disciplined.

528
00:28:53.416 --> 00:28:54.416
You have a son?

529
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:57.875
He died.

530
00:29:00.208 --> 00:29:03.583
He and my husband died
in a highway accident.

531
00:29:03.666 --> 00:29:05.958
That was many years ago.

532
00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:08.458
And do you miss them?

533
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.625
Every single day.

534
00:29:17.833 --> 00:29:19.291
Okay. Come on.

535
00:29:24.291 --> 00:29:26.125
Let's keep practicing.

536
00:29:32.375 --> 00:29:33.958
See you on Thursday.

537
00:29:34.041 --> 00:29:35.625
-Thank you. miss.
-Sure.

538
00:29:35.708 --> 00:29:37.208
Oh. miss…

539
00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:38.125
Yes?

540
00:29:38.625 --> 00:29:40.583
I know what I want to be when I'm older.

541
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.333
What?

542
00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:44.541
A teacher.

543
00:29:48.291 --> 00:29:49.125
Quetzal.

544
00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:54.166
Listen up! Listen up. everybody!

545
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.583
You can't miss the show

546
00:29:56.666 --> 00:29:59.958
of the amazing Palace of Wonders.

547
00:30:00.458 --> 00:30:03.000
Your eyes have never seen
anything like it.

548
00:30:03.083 --> 00:30:04.500
Come to the Palace.

549
00:30:04.583 --> 00:30:06.541
Be a part of the wonders.

550
00:30:06.625 --> 00:30:08.958
Don't stay there. You'll have fun.

551
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:10.541
The whole town can come.

552
00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:13.125
Come. The Palace opened its doors…

553
00:30:13.208 --> 00:30:14.625
Oh. my God!

554
00:30:15.208 --> 00:30:17.291
Did you see that? We have to go.

555
00:30:17.375 --> 00:30:18.791
I always wanted to go to one

556
00:30:18.875 --> 00:30:21.208
and see a magician
pull a rabbit from a hat.

557
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:23.125
Those are only tricks.

558
00:30:23.208 --> 00:30:24.500
But magic tricks.

559
00:30:25.333 --> 00:30:27.458
-But they're tricks.
-But magic ones.

560
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.708
We have to go.

561
00:30:29.791 --> 00:30:31.958
Sure. How will we pay for it?

562
00:30:32.041 --> 00:30:34.208
-I will treat you.
-With what money?

563
00:30:34.791 --> 00:30:36.625
The circus is for dummies.

564
00:30:36.708 --> 00:30:37.708
Isn't it?

565
00:30:37.791 --> 00:30:40.000
How would I know? I've never been to one.

566
00:30:40.083 --> 00:30:42.166
You know what's more fun than the circus?

567
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.000
The waterwheel. Let's go.

568
00:30:44.083 --> 00:30:45.625
-Let's go.
-What is that?

569
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.666
Why didn't Valeria want to come?

570
00:30:49.125 --> 00:30:51.541
Ignore her.
She doesn't know how to have fun.

571
00:30:54.083 --> 00:30:55.583
Is your belly grumbling?

572
00:30:56.416 --> 00:30:59.000
What did you eat?
Do you have a mouse in your belly?

573
00:30:59.083 --> 00:31:00.166
Shut up. fool.

574
00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.333
Did you hear that?

575
00:31:03.416 --> 00:31:06.791
It's number 24.
No. It's Pullman number 49-64.

576
00:31:06.875 --> 00:31:08.875
They only pass by on Wednesdays.

577
00:31:09.458 --> 00:31:10.666
Where are they headed?

578
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:11.875
Laredo.

579
00:31:11.958 --> 00:31:14.000
-What time do they arrive?
-22:25.

580
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:16.666
How come you know so much?

581
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.666
My dad gave me an itinerary.
I study it sometimes.

582
00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:22.541
Hey. do you see that back there?

583
00:31:23.041 --> 00:31:23.875
What?

584
00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:25.583
You can't imagine.

585
00:31:25.666 --> 00:31:26.500
Come.

586
00:31:32.875 --> 00:31:33.916
Come on. Quetzal.

587
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.875
He's itchy. just like me.

588
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:37.875
He's a lot like me.

589
00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:39.583
Okay. come on.

590
00:31:42.416 --> 00:31:43.250
Jump.

591
00:31:43.791 --> 00:31:44.666
Thanks.

592
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:45.583
Come on.

593
00:31:45.666 --> 00:31:47.833
-Stay and keep watch.
-Come here.

594
00:31:49.375 --> 00:31:50.333
What's this?

595
00:31:50.416 --> 00:31:52.166
The land of my father's boss.

596
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.833
-All of this?
-All of it and more.

597
00:31:53.916 --> 00:31:56.166
You can't even see where it ends.

598
00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.750
He has a well. horses. laborers.

599
00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:00.916
The son of a bitch has everything.

600
00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:15.500
Damn.

601
00:32:16.291 --> 00:32:17.208
It's very big.

602
00:32:17.958 --> 00:32:19.166
It looks like a palace.

603
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.333
Don't be silly.
There are no palaces in Mexico.

604
00:32:21.416 --> 00:32:22.750
The municipal palace.

605
00:32:22.833 --> 00:32:24.541
But that's not a real palace.

606
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:36.625
What?

607
00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:39.666
Have you eaten yet?

608
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:40.666
-Yes.
-No.

609
00:32:42.125 --> 00:32:43.125
Let's go inside.

610
00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:50.666
Wow.

611
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.458
Oh. my.

612
00:32:53.166 --> 00:32:54.291
How delicious.

613
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:59.083
Wine.

614
00:33:06.875 --> 00:33:09.708
Help me with this one.
I'll see what I can find in the pantry.

615
00:33:12.958 --> 00:33:14.875
Someone broke into the house!

616
00:33:14.958 --> 00:33:16.000
Lorenzo!

617
00:33:16.083 --> 00:33:18.583
Juan. someone broke into the house!

618
00:33:18.666 --> 00:33:20.125
It's them! Juan!

619
00:33:20.875 --> 00:33:22.708
-Run!
-They went that way.

620
00:33:23.291 --> 00:33:25.250
They went that way. That way!

621
00:33:25.333 --> 00:33:27.208
-They went that way.
-Who were they?

622
00:33:27.291 --> 00:33:28.708
Some damn kids.

623
00:33:29.958 --> 00:33:31.208
Hey. don't shoot.

624
00:33:31.291 --> 00:33:32.500
It's private property.

625
00:33:32.583 --> 00:33:33.708
They're kids. Lorenzo.

626
00:33:33.791 --> 00:33:35.375
No. Juan. they're thieves.

627
00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:39.416
Run!

628
00:33:46.125 --> 00:33:48.125
I thought you weren't hungry. Tuerto.

629
00:33:48.208 --> 00:33:49.500
It's because I got scared.

630
00:33:50.291 --> 00:33:51.416
Wanna see something?

631
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.125
They're silver.

632
00:33:53.208 --> 00:33:55.708
-You stole them?
-The boss is the thief.

633
00:33:55.791 --> 00:33:58.791
If we sell them. we can get enough money
to go to the circus.

634
00:33:59.625 --> 00:34:01.625
I thought the circus was for dummies.

635
00:34:06.458 --> 00:34:07.583
Do you want some?

636
00:34:07.666 --> 00:34:08.500
Give me that.

637
00:34:15.583 --> 00:34:16.416
Do you want some?

638
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.333
No.

639
00:34:18.125 --> 00:34:18.958
I'm leaving.

640
00:34:21.416 --> 00:34:22.458
Let's go. Tuerto.

641
00:34:23.208 --> 00:34:24.208
Wait for me.

642
00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:32.041
The fewer. the better.

643
00:34:36.708 --> 00:34:38.000
Okay. All done.

644
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:39.750
How was it?

645
00:34:41.375 --> 00:34:44.000
What do you think?
It was amazing. Fantastic.

646
00:34:44.083 --> 00:34:46.041
-See you later.
-See you tomorrow.

647
00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:49.791
Actually.
I think it's a very brave thing to do.

648
00:34:49.875 --> 00:34:52.416
-What? Closing down schools?
-No.

649
00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:54.833
Being the face of the department.

650
00:34:55.583 --> 00:34:57.583
Well. I'd like to be a more.

651
00:34:58.666 --> 00:35:00.166
I don't know. cheerful face.

652
00:35:02.208 --> 00:35:04.625
-Bye. See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

653
00:35:04.708 --> 00:35:07.125
I think the director
really likes your work.

654
00:35:08.416 --> 00:35:10.291
-Has he left?
-Yes. a while ago.

655
00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:12.875
-He had a lunch meeting.
-Again?

656
00:35:12.958 --> 00:35:14.500
It's as if eating was his job.

657
00:35:14.583 --> 00:35:17.333
He's always at breakfast.
lunch. supper. and dinner meetings.

658
00:35:17.416 --> 00:35:19.333
You know how politics is.

659
00:35:20.833 --> 00:35:22.833
And speaking of politics.

660
00:35:22.916 --> 00:35:24.166
have you had dinner?

661
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.916
-Do you want to go get something?
-Are you inviting me to dinner?

662
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.083
No. I'm saying we should go together.
but you'll pay.

663
00:35:32.041 --> 00:35:32.875
Come on.

664
00:35:32.958 --> 00:35:35.000
No. I already have plans.

665
00:35:35.083 --> 00:35:35.958
With whom?

666
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.250
I'm just teasing you.

667
00:35:38.333 --> 00:35:39.458
Hmm…

668
00:35:40.166 --> 00:35:42.791
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

669
00:35:42.875 --> 00:35:43.708
Sounds good.

670
00:35:44.958 --> 00:35:47.291
-Have a good rest. Good night.
-You too.

671
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.250
-Do you want anything else?
-The check.

672
00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:12.083
Come get your breakfast. son.

673
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.166
It's served. It'll go cold.

674
00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.541
Did you do your homework?

675
00:36:17.166 --> 00:36:18.250
The homework!

676
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.208
What? You didn't look for anything?

677
00:36:21.291 --> 00:36:22.750
-Ikal.
-I have to go.

678
00:36:22.833 --> 00:36:23.916
Hey. boy!

679
00:36:24.875 --> 00:36:26.458
-Come on. Quetzal.
-Be careful.

680
00:36:26.541 --> 00:36:27.375
Yes.

681
00:36:56.333 --> 00:36:57.208
Relax.

682
00:36:57.875 --> 00:36:59.166
It's for my homework.

683
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.916
Get out!

684
00:37:42.833 --> 00:37:45.083
You're late. What do you have there?

685
00:37:45.833 --> 00:37:47.416
Nothing. It's a surprise.

686
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.666
Come on. Tell us what it is.

687
00:37:51.125 --> 00:37:52.166
Where is Chico?

688
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:53.583
He isn't coming.

689
00:37:53.666 --> 00:37:54.583
Is he sick?

690
00:37:55.791 --> 00:37:57.083
Yes. something like that.

691
00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:03.333
Good morning! Sit down. kids.

692
00:38:04.208 --> 00:38:06.041
Kids. let's start the class.

693
00:38:06.666 --> 00:38:07.708
Very well.

694
00:38:07.791 --> 00:38:09.625
Good morning. children.

695
00:38:09.708 --> 00:38:13.041
Good morning. miss.

696
00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:16.041
-Did you all bring your homework?
-Yes!

697
00:38:16.125 --> 00:38:17.541
Very good.

698
00:38:17.625 --> 00:38:21.500
The students who brought living organisms

699
00:38:21.583 --> 00:38:23.791
will take them back to their environment.

700
00:38:23.875 --> 00:38:26.666
Because what is it
that we must always respect?

701
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:29.166
-Nature!
-Nature!

702
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:30.125
Very good.

703
00:38:30.208 --> 00:38:33.166
Let's start with you. Mr. Rodríguez.
Come here.

704
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:36.750
-Can you show us what you found?
-Yes. but carefully because it can escape.

705
00:38:36.833 --> 00:38:38.916
Let's see. Come here.

706
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.625
Very good. Come here.

707
00:38:40.708 --> 00:38:41.625
Very good.

708
00:38:42.166 --> 00:38:43.208
Let's see.

709
00:38:43.291 --> 00:38:45.083
-Let's see.
-How pretty.

710
00:38:45.166 --> 00:38:46.916
How pretty. It's a butterfly.

711
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.125
Exactly.

712
00:38:48.208 --> 00:38:50.625
It's a monarch butterfly. Very good.

713
00:38:51.583 --> 00:38:55.458
Let's learn about monarch butterflies.

714
00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:59.000
Did you know that monarch butterflies

715
00:38:59.083 --> 00:39:01.708
fly from Canada all the way to Mexico?

716
00:39:01.791 --> 00:39:03.166
No!

717
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:08.083
It's one of nature's
most fascinating insects.

718
00:39:10.458 --> 00:39:12.083
It reminds me of you a bit.

719
00:39:12.916 --> 00:39:15.458
I see you going
from one place to the other.

720
00:39:15.541 --> 00:39:16.750
From north to south.

721
00:39:16.833 --> 00:39:19.125
working on our country's railroads.

722
00:39:19.208 --> 00:39:20.291
What do you think?

723
00:39:20.375 --> 00:39:22.166
-Thanks. miss.
-Very good.

724
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.041
Okay. let's see.

725
00:39:24.708 --> 00:39:25.708
Let's see. Ikal.

726
00:39:26.333 --> 00:39:28.041
Why are you so quiet?

727
00:39:28.125 --> 00:39:29.250
What do you have there?

728
00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:31.083
-Nothing.
-What do you mean?

729
00:39:31.791 --> 00:39:33.333
Come here. Come.

730
00:39:35.083 --> 00:39:36.083
Oh. young man.

731
00:39:38.083 --> 00:39:39.541
Let's see. Give me that.

732
00:39:44.333 --> 00:39:45.583
Ew!

733
00:39:45.666 --> 00:39:47.875
He got that bug from his toilet at home.

734
00:39:47.958 --> 00:39:50.833
-You're the one who came from a toilet.
-Quiet!

735
00:39:50.916 --> 00:39:52.541
Be quiet!

736
00:39:53.041 --> 00:39:53.958
No laughing.

737
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:56.500
What do you see here. Ikal?

738
00:39:56.583 --> 00:39:59.333
-A horrible bug.
-I don't see a horrible bug.

739
00:39:59.416 --> 00:40:02.333
I see a wonderful living organism.

740
00:40:03.916 --> 00:40:06.583
It's a salamander.

741
00:40:06.666 --> 00:40:08.708
Come closer to see it. That's it.

742
00:40:09.208 --> 00:40:13.333
It's one of the most fascinating
living organisms there are.

743
00:40:13.416 --> 00:40:15.625
It's a salamander. Beautiful. right?

744
00:40:16.416 --> 00:40:19.458
It's an extraordinary living organism.

745
00:40:19.541 --> 00:40:21.791
-Extraordinary?
-Yes. extraordinary.

746
00:40:22.708 --> 00:40:24.916
Did you know that salamanders

747
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.208
can adapt to living almost anywhere?

748
00:40:32.083 --> 00:40:33.333
Always remember that.

749
00:40:33.916 --> 00:40:35.416
As long as you are alive.

750
00:40:35.916 --> 00:40:38.083
you can become whatever you want.

751
00:40:38.666 --> 00:40:40.791
And you can live wherever you want.

752
00:40:42.875 --> 00:40:44.125
You are alive.

753
00:40:45.458 --> 00:40:47.166
so choose your life wisely.

754
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.333
Choose what you want carefully.

755
00:40:51.666 --> 00:40:53.166
so that you can be happy.

756
00:40:57.291 --> 00:41:00.541
Do you know
what these animals are also called?

757
00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:02.333
No!

758
00:41:02.416 --> 00:41:03.666
Tritons.

759
00:41:04.291 --> 00:41:06.000
Do you know what a triton is?

760
00:41:06.833 --> 00:41:08.416
Your homework is to find out.

761
00:41:09.083 --> 00:41:10.041
Thanks. miss.

762
00:41:10.125 --> 00:41:11.625
Excellent job. young man.

763
00:41:11.708 --> 00:41:12.625
Excellent!

764
00:41:12.708 --> 00:41:13.666
Thanks. miss.

765
00:41:14.458 --> 00:41:18.250
Very good.
Let's see who is next. Dianita. come here.

766
00:41:19.708 --> 00:41:22.208
Let's see what you brought. What is this?

767
00:41:24.291 --> 00:41:25.791
Tell me. what's the plan?

768
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.875
Are you dressing up as a clown?
Because you are great at that.

769
00:41:29.958 --> 00:41:32.625
"I'll do a magic trick for you. Valeria."

770
00:41:32.708 --> 00:41:35.375
Yes. I'll dress as a clown.
and you as an ass.

771
00:41:37.708 --> 00:41:38.541
Hello!

772
00:41:39.833 --> 00:41:42.125
I guess you came to get tickets.

773
00:41:42.208 --> 00:41:43.041
Yes.

774
00:41:43.125 --> 00:41:44.000
Come here.

775
00:41:45.208 --> 00:41:46.083
Lady.

776
00:41:46.708 --> 00:41:49.666
do you know if the magician
will pull a rabbit from their hat?

777
00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.208
You're not talking to a lady.

778
00:41:53.083 --> 00:41:55.458
You're talking to the magician!

779
00:41:56.166 --> 00:41:57.791
A lady magician?

780
00:41:57.875 --> 00:42:00.708
And not just any magician.
She's Etérea. the Magician.

781
00:42:00.791 --> 00:42:04.666
She created this whole show.
which has travelled all over the world.

782
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.250
Spain.

783
00:42:06.333 --> 00:42:08.500
France. Japan.

784
00:42:08.583 --> 00:42:09.583
China…

785
00:42:09.666 --> 00:42:10.791
And who are you?

786
00:42:11.291 --> 00:42:12.375
Diamantina.

787
00:42:13.416 --> 00:42:14.666
my right-hand person.

788
00:42:15.208 --> 00:42:16.708
And my left-hand one too.

789
00:42:17.333 --> 00:42:20.583
She's known internationally
for her beauty.

790
00:42:20.666 --> 00:42:21.833
-Oh.
-Of course you are.

791
00:42:21.916 --> 00:42:24.458
How are you able to speak
so many languages?

792
00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:27.916
The universal language
of magic and fantasy.

793
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.500
My friend wants to know
if you'll make a rabbit appear.

794
00:42:30.583 --> 00:42:33.500
-He'll invite the girl he likes.
-Shut up!

795
00:42:33.583 --> 00:42:35.833
Then bring your future girlfriend.

796
00:42:35.916 --> 00:42:38.708
It's a show she will never forget.

797
00:42:38.791 --> 00:42:39.666
Never.

798
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.708
So what. are you buying tickets or not?

799
00:42:41.791 --> 00:42:43.666
Only if you make a rabbit appear.

800
00:42:51.416 --> 00:42:53.250
Does this answer your question?

801
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.250
How much are the tickets?

802
00:42:55.333 --> 00:42:56.458
Two-fifty.

803
00:42:59.958 --> 00:43:00.791
Hold on.

804
00:43:01.291 --> 00:43:02.208
Come here.

805
00:43:08.083 --> 00:43:09.375
Voilà.

806
00:43:10.166 --> 00:43:11.000
Catch it.

807
00:43:11.958 --> 00:43:12.833
What is this?

808
00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:14.333
A two-for-one coupon.

809
00:43:14.833 --> 00:43:15.875
Thank you.

810
00:43:15.958 --> 00:43:17.333
Okay. there you go.

811
00:43:17.416 --> 00:43:18.250
-Bye.
-Bye.

812
00:43:18.333 --> 00:43:19.875
-Thank you! Goodbye.
-Bye.

813
00:43:19.958 --> 00:43:21.166
Goodbye. magician.

814
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:22.875
Cheers.

815
00:43:22.958 --> 00:43:23.791
Cheers.

816
00:43:33.791 --> 00:43:35.083
Two hundred forty…

817
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:38.666
Ikal.

818
00:43:39.916 --> 00:43:41.041
Go to bed. my son.

819
00:43:42.333 --> 00:43:44.500
-Yes.
-Have you brushed your teeth?

820
00:43:44.583 --> 00:43:45.750
Yes. Mom.

821
00:43:46.541 --> 00:43:47.666
Turn off the light.

822
00:43:48.166 --> 00:43:49.208
Go to bed.

823
00:44:11.333 --> 00:44:14.083
You haven't said a word
since you got home. Tomás.

824
00:44:14.583 --> 00:44:15.416
What's the matter?

825
00:44:17.125 --> 00:44:18.625
Are you okay?

826
00:44:25.041 --> 00:44:27.750
There are many rumors spreading
among the team.

827
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:30.500
Nobody knows how long the work will last.

828
00:44:30.583 --> 00:44:32.416
We've almost finished the section.

829
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.416
Did the union people say anything?

830
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.916
They say this administration
is looking for ways to cut expenses.

831
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.458
Tomás.

832
00:44:43.125 --> 00:44:45.375
You know that I can also work.

833
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:50.666
I don't know how we'll do it.

834
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:53.375
but you won't work
until you have fully recovered.

835
00:44:53.958 --> 00:44:55.041
I will be fine.

836
00:44:56.125 --> 00:44:58.125
We will be fine.

837
00:44:58.208 --> 00:44:59.125
Besides. look.

838
00:44:59.958 --> 00:45:02.291
I feel this place agrees with me.

839
00:45:03.375 --> 00:45:05.166
And I think it agrees with Ikal too.

840
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.500
Let me help you with the dishes.

841
00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:43.708
-Ready.
-Lift them.

842
00:46:46.333 --> 00:46:47.458
The sun is intense.

843
00:46:47.541 --> 00:46:49.041
Oh. yes. It's hot.

844
00:46:53.541 --> 00:46:56.666
If you want to rest. go home. dudes.
We must finish this section.

845
00:46:57.375 --> 00:47:00.500
Let's take a break. boss.
The sun is very intense.

846
00:47:01.541 --> 00:47:03.208
Tomás Machuca and his ideas.

847
00:47:03.708 --> 00:47:04.583
All right.

848
00:47:05.125 --> 00:47:06.791
This team can take a break.

849
00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:09.375
You'll make up for it
when it's not as hot.

850
00:47:09.458 --> 00:47:10.416
Thank you. boss.

851
00:47:10.916 --> 00:47:11.833
Thanks. boss.

852
00:47:13.666 --> 00:47:14.500
Domínguez.

853
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.833
Can you do me a favor?

854
00:47:17.916 --> 00:47:18.750
Yes.

855
00:47:20.416 --> 00:47:21.958
Can you tell me what it says here?

856
00:47:25.541 --> 00:47:26.708
"For my dad

857
00:47:27.416 --> 00:47:28.958
from his son. Ikal."

858
00:47:34.041 --> 00:47:36.375
The Palace of Wonders

859
00:47:36.458 --> 00:47:39.833
opens its doors to kids and adults.

860
00:47:40.625 --> 00:47:42.291
You cannot miss

861
00:47:42.375 --> 00:47:45.000
this exciting show.

862
00:47:45.666 --> 00:47:50.416
The Palace of Wonders opens its doors.
Come see us!

863
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.083
Goodbye!

864
00:47:57.333 --> 00:47:59.333
Recess is over. kids!

865
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:03.083
Come on!

866
00:48:03.833 --> 00:48:06.750
Why go to the circus
when you already look like one?

867
00:48:07.916 --> 00:48:08.750
This one.

868
00:48:18.125 --> 00:48:20.083
Are you serious because of the circus?

869
00:48:23.625 --> 00:48:24.875
Don't worry.

870
00:48:24.958 --> 00:48:27.458
It was too much money
to be able to get it.

871
00:48:27.958 --> 00:48:28.916
Well.

872
00:48:29.541 --> 00:48:30.375
the thing is…

873
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:33.666
that I wanted

874
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.333
to do magic for you.

875
00:48:44.333 --> 00:48:45.791
I will show you a trick.

876
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:48.000
Give me your Kalimán.

877
00:48:56.125 --> 00:48:59.333
Now pay close attention
because I'll make it disappear.

878
00:49:00.041 --> 00:49:01.083
Close your eyes.

879
00:49:01.875 --> 00:49:02.958
Go on. Close them.

880
00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:13.333
Hey!

881
00:49:16.916 --> 00:49:18.500
What do clouds taste like?

882
00:49:19.958 --> 00:49:21.041
Sugar?

883
00:49:21.791 --> 00:49:22.875
Okay. Your turn.

884
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:26.000
I already chose.
You can choose whatever you like.

885
00:49:27.166 --> 00:49:28.416
Cotton.

886
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.583
That doesn't count. I chose that.

887
00:49:30.666 --> 00:49:31.708
Choose something else.

888
00:49:32.666 --> 00:49:35.916
One day. you'll also find
this children's game boring.

889
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.708
You'll find it boring to sit here

890
00:49:37.791 --> 00:49:40.500
and imagine
what clouds look or taste like.

891
00:49:43.125 --> 00:49:44.000
Valeria.

892
00:49:45.333 --> 00:49:48.000
playing with you
will never be boring to me.

893
00:49:49.166 --> 00:49:50.666
I like playing with you.

894
00:51:25.375 --> 00:51:27.375
Get out! Go!

895
00:51:27.458 --> 00:51:28.500
Get out!

896
00:51:28.583 --> 00:51:30.625
Go!

897
00:51:31.208 --> 00:51:32.208
Get out! Go!

898
00:51:32.291 --> 00:51:34.250
Come on. Get out!

899
00:51:36.708 --> 00:51:39.208
The teacher gave us a lot of homework.

900
00:51:39.291 --> 00:51:40.666
A lot.

901
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:42.083
I like History.

902
00:51:43.458 --> 00:51:46.000
-What's he looking at?
-What are you barking at. Quetzal?

903
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:48.416
Hey. friends.

904
00:51:50.666 --> 00:51:53.041
-What happened to your face?
-I fell.

905
00:51:53.791 --> 00:51:55.166
Against whose fist?

906
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:56.208
Nobody's.

907
00:51:56.291 --> 00:51:57.833
Why didn't you come to class?

908
00:51:57.916 --> 00:51:59.458
I have something for you. Valeria.

909
00:51:59.541 --> 00:52:00.833
Hold on.

910
00:52:00.916 --> 00:52:02.875
The teacher asked about you.

911
00:52:02.958 --> 00:52:04.958
You can let me see your notes later.

912
00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:10.083
Here you go.

913
00:52:10.875 --> 00:52:13.291
It's a ticket for the Palace of Wonders.

914
00:52:14.333 --> 00:52:15.208
Thank you.

915
00:52:17.583 --> 00:52:19.583
I have another little thing here.

916
00:52:20.166 --> 00:52:21.125
It's for Tuerto.

917
00:52:22.291 --> 00:52:23.791
-Oh. gosh. For me?
-Sure.

918
00:52:23.875 --> 00:52:25.583
I thought the circus was for dummies.

919
00:52:26.541 --> 00:52:28.375
I also have something for you. Worm.

920
00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:34.583
Thank you.

921
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:39.583
Thank you.

922
00:52:41.333 --> 00:52:43.083
I love it. It's beautiful.

923
00:52:43.166 --> 00:52:46.333
PALACE OF WONDERS

924
00:52:48.583 --> 00:52:49.541
Hello!

925
00:52:52.166 --> 00:52:53.166
Here you go.

926
00:52:54.375 --> 00:52:55.291
Here you go.

927
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.250
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

928
00:52:57.833 --> 00:52:59.875
Where did you get so much money?

929
00:52:59.958 --> 00:53:00.916
Working.

930
00:53:01.458 --> 00:53:03.750
-Where?
-On the boss's land.

931
00:53:06.083 --> 00:53:08.416
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

932
00:53:10.083 --> 00:53:14.583
-Friend!
-Ladies and gentlemen. girls and boys.

933
00:53:14.666 --> 00:53:18.916
Welcome to the Palace of Wonders.

934
00:53:19.416 --> 00:53:22.791
where dreams become reality.

935
00:53:22.875 --> 00:53:25.250
Bravo!

936
00:53:25.333 --> 00:53:27.625
On this beautiful night.
I want to invite you

937
00:53:27.708 --> 00:53:30.625
to go on a ride through the stars.

938
00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:33.875
Here is Roldán.

939
00:53:33.958 --> 00:53:35.958
the air man!

940
00:53:36.041 --> 00:53:38.041
-Give it up for him!
-Bravo!

941
00:54:00.958 --> 00:54:01.916
Bravo!

942
00:54:09.666 --> 00:54:11.083
Why aren't you laughing?

943
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.666
Clowns don't make me laugh.

944
00:54:14.416 --> 00:54:16.958
-How do they make you feel?
-Sad.

945
00:54:17.041 --> 00:54:19.083
And now. Diamantina

946
00:54:19.166 --> 00:54:23.125
will perform
one of the most chilling tricks

947
00:54:23.208 --> 00:54:26.000
in showbusiness.

948
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:30.208
We ask you to remain silent

949
00:54:30.291 --> 00:54:33.416
so that she can focus.

950
00:54:45.791 --> 00:54:46.916
What's wrong?

951
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.833
No. I cannot watch that.

952
00:54:48.916 --> 00:54:51.708
Cover your eyes
and we'll tell you when it's over.

953
00:55:10.291 --> 00:55:14.375
And now.
one of the most enigmatic illusionists

954
00:55:14.458 --> 00:55:17.083
in Mexico and Latin America.

955
00:55:17.166 --> 00:55:19.708
She has travelled all over the world.

956
00:55:19.791 --> 00:55:22.333
From the mystical city of Aztlán.

957
00:55:22.416 --> 00:55:25.375
here is Etérea. the Magician!

958
00:55:35.333 --> 00:55:36.375
What's she going to do?

959
00:55:36.958 --> 00:55:38.416
She will be cut in half.

960
00:55:40.333 --> 00:55:42.541
Her legs will be
where her hands should be.

961
00:55:55.291 --> 00:55:57.458
Restore her. Etérea.

962
00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.291
It is just magic.

963
00:55:59.375 --> 00:56:02.750
I wouldn't like to be cut in half.
even if it was only magic.

964
00:56:15.458 --> 00:56:16.791
And now.

965
00:56:16.875 --> 00:56:19.250
my favorite moment.

966
00:56:20.625 --> 00:56:21.708
Diamantina…

967
00:56:24.041 --> 00:56:25.791
Look. a hat!

968
00:56:26.791 --> 00:56:28.791
If a rabbit comes out. I'll die.

969
00:56:31.291 --> 00:56:32.916
Etérea. a rabbit.

970
00:56:34.416 --> 00:56:35.666
What is it?

971
00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:39.000
The rabbit!

972
00:56:40.958 --> 00:56:42.500
-No!
-Goodbye!

973
00:56:42.583 --> 00:56:44.583
We want a rabbit!

974
00:56:47.708 --> 00:56:49.500
What do we have here?

975
00:56:55.958 --> 00:56:58.375
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

976
00:56:58.458 --> 00:56:59.916
Thank you!

977
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Welcome to the Palace of Wonders.

978
00:57:05.375 --> 00:57:08.000
My sister won't believe me
when I tell her all this.

979
00:57:08.083 --> 00:57:10.791
Next time the circus comes.
we'll invite her.

980
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:14.083
How did you get the tickets. Chico?

981
00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:16.875
It's none of your business.

982
00:57:17.458 --> 00:57:18.791
Where did you get them?

983
00:57:19.625 --> 00:57:20.625
Don't be nosy.

984
00:57:21.125 --> 00:57:22.083
What did you steal?

985
00:57:22.166 --> 00:57:23.583
What's your problem. asshole?

986
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:25.875
Apologize.

987
00:57:27.166 --> 00:57:28.500
-Apologize!
-No!

988
00:57:28.583 --> 00:57:30.041
You will apologize.

989
00:57:30.125 --> 00:57:31.875
-Make me!
-Stupid midget!

990
00:57:32.708 --> 00:57:33.583
There he is!

991
00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:36.666
Come here. damn blondie!
Come here. asshole!

992
00:57:39.958 --> 00:57:42.166
No. What do we do now?

993
00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:45.500
-We should tell Miss Georgina.
-Let's go home instead.

994
00:57:45.583 --> 00:57:47.333
No. We can't leave him alone.

995
00:57:47.416 --> 00:57:49.083
Let's go get some help.

996
00:57:49.166 --> 00:57:50.125
Get him!

997
00:57:50.208 --> 00:57:52.291
Stop. asshole! Calm down!

998
00:57:52.375 --> 00:57:53.666
Stop!

999
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:55.166
Stay there. asshole!

1000
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:57.875
-What do you want?
-Don't move! Let's go.

1001
00:57:57.958 --> 00:57:59.041
-Move.
-Asshole.

1002
00:58:05.625 --> 00:58:07.208
I don't like that boy.

1003
00:58:07.958 --> 00:58:10.375
He's on his own. He doesn't have anybody.

1004
00:58:10.875 --> 00:58:12.125
He's a bad influence.

1005
00:58:12.625 --> 00:58:14.333
He could endanger Ikal.

1006
00:58:14.416 --> 00:58:17.541
He'll have to decide on his own
what is best for him.

1007
00:58:18.125 --> 00:58:19.750
-Including his friends.
-No.

1008
00:58:20.375 --> 00:58:22.250
You should talk to him. Tomás.

1009
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.250
He doesn't listen to me.

1010
00:58:24.333 --> 00:58:26.458
Don't worry.

1011
00:58:26.541 --> 00:58:27.708
He's fine.

1012
00:58:27.791 --> 00:58:29.541
Who does something like that?

1013
00:58:32.208 --> 00:58:35.500
We can all help him mend his ways.

1014
00:58:35.583 --> 00:58:37.166
-Please. gentlemen.
-Ikal.

1015
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:39.625
That boy doesn't have many opportunities.

1016
00:58:39.708 --> 00:58:41.208
Please consider it.

1017
00:58:41.291 --> 00:58:43.791
-I want to know what they say.
-It's adult stuff.

1018
00:58:43.875 --> 00:58:45.500
They're talking about my friend.

1019
00:58:45.583 --> 00:58:47.333
What do you want from us?

1020
00:58:47.416 --> 00:58:50.041
-Come with us to talk to the boss.
-The boss?

1021
00:58:50.125 --> 00:58:51.000
Yes.

1022
00:58:51.083 --> 00:58:53.458
Why did he get in trouble with that man?

1023
00:58:53.541 --> 00:58:54.416
Hunger.

1024
00:58:58.791 --> 00:59:00.375
And what will we say to him?

1025
00:59:00.458 --> 00:59:04.541
We'll ask him to release him.
We'll say that we vouch for him. right?

1026
00:59:04.625 --> 00:59:08.291
Why would the landowner listen
to a bunch of ignorant laborers?

1027
00:59:08.375 --> 00:59:11.375
We heard he'll bring good business
here in town. miss.

1028
00:59:11.458 --> 00:59:13.666
That's why we're fixing the tracks.

1029
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.625
We don't want to get in trouble.

1030
00:59:16.125 --> 00:59:18.500
He could be the son of any of you.

1031
00:59:37.916 --> 00:59:39.041
Miss.

1032
00:59:39.125 --> 00:59:40.375
we're sorry.

1033
00:59:40.458 --> 00:59:41.666
I hope you understand.

1034
00:59:42.333 --> 00:59:44.000
We'd really like to help.

1035
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000
But we can't.

1036
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:49.958
Good night.

1037
00:59:50.958 --> 00:59:53.041
-Good night. miss.
-Good night.

1038
00:59:53.958 --> 00:59:54.791
Please.

1039
01:00:23.708 --> 01:00:24.541
Chico!

1040
01:00:26.166 --> 01:00:28.791
Why are you here?
Leave before they see you.

1041
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:30.791
Are you okay?

1042
01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:31.708
Yes.

1043
01:00:31.791 --> 01:00:33.708
I think they will release me.

1044
01:00:33.791 --> 01:00:35.875
Everybody is worried about you.

1045
01:00:35.958 --> 01:00:36.958
Really?

1046
01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:39.250
Yes. They were asking about you.

1047
01:00:39.333 --> 01:00:41.666
That idiotic boss thinks he'll scare me.

1048
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:43.208
but that won't happen.

1049
01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:45.250
-I brought you something.
-What?

1050
01:00:45.333 --> 01:00:48.750
-A file to help me escape?
-A gift for the gang leader.

1051
01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:52.625
Some tamales and a Kalimán.

1052
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.375
How delicious.

1053
01:00:58.458 --> 01:00:59.625
Damn Worm.

1054
01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:02.083
Silence.

1055
01:01:02.166 --> 01:01:03.000
I should go.

1056
01:01:04.541 --> 01:01:05.375
Ikal…

1057
01:01:06.625 --> 01:01:08.125
Thanks for being my friend.

1058
01:01:12.583 --> 01:01:13.541
Take care.

1059
01:01:25.416 --> 01:01:26.291
Tomás.

1060
01:01:26.875 --> 01:01:28.000
the boy is awake.

1061
01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:31.416
Good morning.

1062
01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:33.375
Thank you.

1063
01:01:33.458 --> 01:01:34.625
Good morning. Dad.

1064
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.708
Come. son. Take a seat.
We want to talk to you.

1065
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:41.458
I only brought him a present.

1066
01:01:41.541 --> 01:01:42.958
What do you mean?

1067
01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.458
-Sit down.
-Nothing.

1068
01:01:48.416 --> 01:01:49.541
Look. son.

1069
01:01:49.625 --> 01:01:50.875
I know it's very hard

1070
01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:54.000
to be constantly moving to a new place.

1071
01:01:54.083 --> 01:01:55.583
We're moving again?

1072
01:01:55.666 --> 01:01:58.208
Wait. Let your father finish talking.

1073
01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:03.333
I asked the union to assign me
to a fixed location.

1074
01:02:05.041 --> 01:02:06.000
They said no.

1075
01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.458
So. your mom and I
made a very important decision.

1076
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.166
It won't be easy.

1077
01:02:12.708 --> 01:02:14.958
but we think it's the best for all of us.

1078
01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:16.958
We're going to move.

1079
01:02:19.541 --> 01:02:20.541
Aren't you happy?

1080
01:02:21.125 --> 01:02:24.041
But I don't want to move to the city.
I want to stay here.

1081
01:02:24.125 --> 01:02:26.375
And who said we would move to the city?

1082
01:02:26.458 --> 01:02:28.583
Your dad will quit his job. son.

1083
01:02:28.666 --> 01:02:30.791
We'll look for a house in this town

1084
01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:32.666
while you finish elementary school.

1085
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:33.791
Really?

1086
01:02:34.958 --> 01:02:36.708
Really. Are you happy?

1087
01:02:36.791 --> 01:02:37.875
Yes!

1088
01:02:37.958 --> 01:02:38.791
Huh?

1089
01:02:40.166 --> 01:02:41.083
Thank you!

1090
01:02:41.166 --> 01:02:43.083
You're very strong now. son.

1091
01:02:43.875 --> 01:02:45.666
Did you hear that. Quetzal?

1092
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:48.125
We're not leaving. We're staying!

1093
01:02:48.208 --> 01:02:49.458
Let's tell everybody!

1094
01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:51.166
We're staying!

1095
01:02:54.458 --> 01:02:55.333
Come on!

1096
01:02:55.416 --> 01:02:56.250
Hey!

1097
01:02:56.333 --> 01:02:57.625
We're staying!

1098
01:02:57.708 --> 01:02:58.541
Hey!

1099
01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.375
We're not leaving!

1100
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:02.625
We're staying!

1101
01:03:06.666 --> 01:03:07.541
Etérea!

1102
01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:09.458
Etérea!

1103
01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:10.916
-Guess what?
-What?

1104
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
We're staying!

1105
01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.208
We won't live in the railcar anymore.

1106
01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.291
-Oh. that sounds great.
-Yes.

1107
01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:19.500
-I'll see you next year.
-Of course. See you next year.

1108
01:03:19.583 --> 01:03:21.791
Well. if we manage to leave. Look at this.

1109
01:03:21.875 --> 01:03:22.708
Yes.

1110
01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:23.708
Valeria!

1111
01:03:25.708 --> 01:03:26.666
Valeria!

1112
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:27.750
She's over there.

1113
01:03:28.333 --> 01:03:29.708
-Ikal!
-Valeria!

1114
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.208
We're staying!

1115
01:03:32.291 --> 01:03:33.250
Why?

1116
01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:35.166
My dad will quit his job.

1117
01:03:35.666 --> 01:03:37.541
-I'll tell you later.
-Yes. Bye!

1118
01:03:37.625 --> 01:03:39.208
-I'll tell everybody.
-Yes.

1119
01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:40.791
-Quetzal. come on!
-Bye.

1120
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:45.833
Ikal.

1121
01:03:54.625 --> 01:03:55.458
Chico.

1122
01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.458
Did you escape?

1123
01:03:58.541 --> 01:03:59.375
No.

1124
01:03:59.875 --> 01:04:00.791
I was released.

1125
01:04:01.375 --> 01:04:03.916
My family will stay and live here. Chico.

1126
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.208
-Really?
-Yes.

1127
01:04:06.833 --> 01:04:07.666
Are you okay?

1128
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:09.875
If I move a bit. even my ass hurts.

1129
01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:12.583
Well. ask Tuerto to massage it.

1130
01:04:13.833 --> 01:04:15.500
Don't make me laugh. idiot.

1131
01:04:17.666 --> 01:04:18.958
Who beat you up?

1132
01:04:19.041 --> 01:04:20.416
The boss's men.

1133
01:04:22.208 --> 01:04:24.166
I want to leave. and you want to stay.

1134
01:04:24.708 --> 01:04:27.041
One person's heaven
is another person's hell.

1135
01:04:28.791 --> 01:04:29.916
Okay.

1136
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.541
Let's go. It's getting late.

1137
01:04:31.625 --> 01:04:32.500
You go.

1138
01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:35.041
I'll stay around here.

1139
01:04:35.541 --> 01:04:37.375
I won't go back to my dad's house.

1140
01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:39.500
What are you going to do then?

1141
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:42.916
You could stay at the school with Quetzal.

1142
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.541
Miss Georgina
would be very happy to see you.

1143
01:04:45.625 --> 01:04:47.625
-Are you sure?
-Yes. I am.

1144
01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:49.708
Okay. I should go.

1145
01:04:49.791 --> 01:04:52.625
My mom will beat me up.
and it's getting really late.

1146
01:04:52.708 --> 01:04:55.250
You can ask Tuerto to massage your ass.

1147
01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:57.333
I'm out of here.

1148
01:04:59.416 --> 01:05:00.375
Quetzal!

1149
01:05:00.458 --> 01:05:01.333
Ikal…

1150
01:05:02.875 --> 01:05:04.375
I am glad you're staying.

1151
01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:14.958
Hugo.

1152
01:05:15.791 --> 01:05:16.916
Good morning.

1153
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.375
Good morning.
I was wondering what that noise was.

1154
01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:21.958
-You're here very early.
-I guess.

1155
01:05:22.833 --> 01:05:24.500
Anything new for today?

1156
01:05:24.583 --> 01:05:27.000
No. We'll keep working
on the new development plan.

1157
01:05:27.708 --> 01:05:31.000
The only thing that plan is developing
in me is horrible nightmares.

1158
01:05:32.125 --> 01:05:33.083
Good morning.

1159
01:05:33.166 --> 01:05:36.750
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION

1160
01:05:36.833 --> 01:05:37.708
Good morning.

1161
01:05:38.416 --> 01:05:39.291
Good morning.

1162
01:06:07.666 --> 01:06:10.250
-Mirna. is someone with the boss?
-No. but he's busy.

1163
01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:12.250
-I'll go inside.
-No. wait!

1164
01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:13.583
I'll get admonished.

1165
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.166
Now what? Why don't you knock?

1166
01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:18.875
-I apologize. sir.
-Thanks. Mirna.

1167
01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:21.166
I'm sorry.

1168
01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:23.291
Sir…

1169
01:06:24.541 --> 01:06:26.375
I'm sorry. but I cannot do it.

1170
01:06:27.208 --> 01:06:31.166
Valenzuela. I know it's a hard job.
but it's for the greater good.

1171
01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:32.916
No. but please look at them.

1172
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.458
Yes. Everything we do

1173
01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:37.250
is to ensure a better future for them.

1174
01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:40.500
That's the thing. For these kids.
the future is a very distant thing.

1175
01:06:40.583 --> 01:06:42.166
They just have their present.

1176
01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:44.208
-I'll be back in the afternoon.
-Yes. sir.

1177
01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:48.083
Valenzuela. you aren't gauging
the meaning of the federal reform.

1178
01:06:48.166 --> 01:06:50.958
It's an effort.
But it's also a sacrifice for everyone.

1179
01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:53.333
For you. for me.
for the kids at that school.

1180
01:06:53.416 --> 01:06:54.916
Then send someone else.

1181
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.375
There's nobody else. It's your job.

1182
01:07:04.125 --> 01:07:05.000
Dad!

1183
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:06.833
Son!

1184
01:07:10.958 --> 01:07:12.458
Thank you very much. Dad.

1185
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.333
I love you very much.

1186
01:07:14.416 --> 01:07:16.291
I love you very much too. boy!

1187
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:19.458
I'll be a good student.

1188
01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:21.291
You will be proud of me.

1189
01:07:21.833 --> 01:07:23.791
I am already proud of you. son.

1190
01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:26.250
Let's sing.

1191
01:07:27.583 --> 01:07:29.666
I sell beans!

1192
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:33.083
Well. you are in Apizaco

1193
01:08:32.708 --> 01:08:35.416
I know many of you
want to leave this town.

1194
01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.500
Some of you

1195
01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.500
have already requested a transfer.

1196
01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:43.875
But that won't happen
until we finish this section.

1197
01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.625
But. boss. it's dangerous.

1198
01:08:46.708 --> 01:08:47.750
Yes. it is.

1199
01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:52.458
We'll finish by the end of the month.
regardless of what happens.

1200
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.125
Great things are expected for this area.

1201
01:08:57.458 --> 01:09:00.166
And that won't start until this is ready.

1202
01:09:00.958 --> 01:09:02.500
If someone doesn't like it.

1203
01:09:03.541 --> 01:09:05.250
they know where the exit is.

1204
01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:08.625
You.

1205
01:09:09.208 --> 01:09:10.333
Tomás Machuca.

1206
01:09:11.333 --> 01:09:13.666
you're always asking for breaks.

1207
01:09:14.708 --> 01:09:15.833
so serve as an example.

1208
01:09:16.458 --> 01:09:17.333
Come on!

1209
01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:20.666
Let's do it.

1210
01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:22.625
Come on.

1211
01:09:24.375 --> 01:09:25.666
All of you. Come on!

1212
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.625
It's not like you'll shrink.

1213
01:09:32.583 --> 01:09:33.625
Come on!

1214
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.083
"Each person…"

1215
01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:51.958
"Each person…"

1216
01:09:54.041 --> 01:09:55.958
Give me a moment. kids.

1217
01:09:57.208 --> 01:09:58.208
Miss?

1218
01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:00.041
May I read?

1219
01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:01.208
Yes. please.

1220
01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:04.708
Thank you.

1221
01:10:05.708 --> 01:10:08.291
Pay attention
to what your classmates read.

1222
01:10:10.458 --> 01:10:11.708
"Each person…

1223
01:10:13.625 --> 01:10:15.083
is on their own

1224
01:10:16.541 --> 01:10:18.958
in the heart of the planet."

1225
01:10:20.083 --> 01:10:23.833
"Just like a sunbeam…

1226
01:10:33.208 --> 01:10:34.041
when…"

1227
01:10:34.125 --> 01:10:36.833
Some people
are coming to the school. miss.

1228
01:10:36.916 --> 01:10:38.416
They're coming here.

1229
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.041
Okay. Go on. Pay attention.

1230
01:10:41.125 --> 01:10:46.583
"It was barely op… open.

1231
01:10:46.666 --> 01:10:48.458
the indo…"

1232
01:10:51.541 --> 01:10:54.208
-Miss. can you please come?
-Yes. sure.

1233
01:11:02.416 --> 01:11:04.250
Do you think I haven't noticed?

1234
01:11:05.458 --> 01:11:07.708
-What?
-That you help the teacher.

1235
01:11:13.958 --> 01:11:14.916
Ikal.

1236
01:11:15.541 --> 01:11:16.791
Come with me. please.

1237
01:11:29.166 --> 01:11:31.750
Come on. son.
I have to bring you to your mom.

1238
01:11:37.958 --> 01:11:39.000
Ikal!

1239
01:11:40.791 --> 01:11:41.958
Ikal!

1240
01:12:05.416 --> 01:12:06.291
Son.

1241
01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:17.750
Dad!

1242
01:13:24.291 --> 01:13:26.416
Come. son. Please help me with this.

1243
01:13:31.291 --> 01:13:33.208
You'll really enjoy your cousins' company.

1244
01:13:34.125 --> 01:13:35.791
I don't even remember them.

1245
01:13:37.791 --> 01:13:38.625
I know.

1246
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.416
But I'm sure you'll enjoy their company.

1247
01:13:45.791 --> 01:13:47.458
Why can't we stay here?

1248
01:13:52.291 --> 01:13:54.041
Because we're all leaving. Ikal.

1249
01:14:10.166 --> 01:14:11.166
We'll be fine.

1250
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.375
We'll be fine. son.

1251
01:14:19.041 --> 01:14:20.333
It's okay.

1252
01:14:20.416 --> 01:14:21.833
It's okay. You can cry.

1253
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.208
Cry if you want to cry. Ikal.

1254
01:14:28.375 --> 01:14:30.458
Cry as much as you need. son.

1255
01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:38.000
Can't we bring Quetzal with us?

1256
01:14:38.833 --> 01:14:39.875
No.

1257
01:14:39.958 --> 01:14:42.541
I can't leave him alone. I promised.

1258
01:14:42.625 --> 01:14:44.833
But Quetzal will be with the teacher.

1259
01:14:45.333 --> 01:14:46.458
He won't be alone.

1260
01:14:47.041 --> 01:14:49.041
Your friends will also take care of him.

1261
01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:52.041
And. once we get settled.

1262
01:14:53.041 --> 01:14:55.291
you'll be able to come and visit them.

1263
01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:02.458
I don't want to come back here.

1264
01:15:41.708 --> 01:15:43.291
Let's go!

1265
01:15:44.125 --> 01:15:45.958
We leave in two hours. people.

1266
01:15:47.958 --> 01:15:49.000
Come on! Up!

1267
01:15:50.625 --> 01:15:51.875
In two hours!

1268
01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:58.666
I'll pray to the Virgin
to look after you and your boy. Lucero.

1269
01:15:59.541 --> 01:16:00.541
Thanks. Toña.

1270
01:16:01.666 --> 01:16:04.208
I'll go see if my husband
has packed everything.

1271
01:16:04.291 --> 01:16:05.166
Okay.

1272
01:16:07.208 --> 01:16:10.375
Hey. Antonia.
Thank you very much for everything.

1273
01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:12.875
-Ikal!
-You are welcome.

1274
01:16:13.791 --> 01:16:15.041
-See you later.
-Ikal!

1275
01:16:15.125 --> 01:16:16.458
-Bye. Ikal!
-Ikal!

1276
01:16:16.958 --> 01:16:17.833
Bye.

1277
01:16:18.458 --> 01:16:19.541
Ikal!

1278
01:16:19.625 --> 01:16:21.833
Miss Georgina has a surprise for you.

1279
01:16:21.916 --> 01:16:22.958
Come on.

1280
01:16:23.041 --> 01:16:24.958
I can't. We're about to leave.

1281
01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.750
-Come on. Let's go.
-Yes. let's go.

1282
01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:29.875
Go on. Go say goodbye.

1283
01:16:29.958 --> 01:16:31.708
We still have some time.

1284
01:16:31.791 --> 01:16:32.750
Give me that.

1285
01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:37.000
-I won't be long.
-Okay.

1286
01:16:37.083 --> 01:16:38.416
-Come on.
-Let's go.

1287
01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.375
Hurry. or I'll get there first!

1288
01:16:44.791 --> 01:16:47.458
Miss! We brought him!

1289
01:16:49.958 --> 01:16:52.250
-He's here.
-We brought Ikal.

1290
01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:53.833
Come here. Ikal.

1291
01:16:58.166 --> 01:17:00.208
We decided to take the class photo early

1292
01:17:00.291 --> 01:17:02.000
so that you can be in it. Come on.

1293
01:17:02.083 --> 01:17:03.875
Kids. Ikal is here.

1294
01:17:03.958 --> 01:17:07.041
-Hi. Ikal!
-Go to your spots. just like we practiced.

1295
01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:10.500
Did you like the surprise?

1296
01:17:10.583 --> 01:17:12.125
This is the cherry on top.

1297
01:17:14.625 --> 01:17:16.500
Chico! You came!

1298
01:17:16.583 --> 01:17:18.541
Did you think I'd miss being in the photo?

1299
01:17:19.958 --> 01:17:21.125
Quetzal!

1300
01:17:22.375 --> 01:17:23.583
Okay.

1301
01:17:23.666 --> 01:17:25.000
All right. Alejandro.

1302
01:17:25.083 --> 01:17:26.375
We're ready.

1303
01:17:27.833 --> 01:17:29.916
One. two…

1304
01:17:31.333 --> 01:17:33.333
Cheese!

1305
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:37.708
Come in.

1306
01:17:45.958 --> 01:17:48.791
You'll do really well in the city.
You'll see.

1307
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:53.375
Why are you sad? What's wrong?

1308
01:17:54.083 --> 01:17:55.666
Have you forgotten?

1309
01:17:56.208 --> 01:17:57.208
I told you.

1310
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.208
You are a triton.

1311
01:17:59.291 --> 01:18:00.583
The lizard?

1312
01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:01.958
No.

1313
01:18:02.458 --> 01:18:04.875
Someone who can adapt

1314
01:18:04.958 --> 01:18:06.666
and survive anywhere.

1315
01:18:08.291 --> 01:18:09.833
Do you know who Triton is?

1316
01:18:10.958 --> 01:18:12.166
For the Greeks.

1317
01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:14.500
he was the god of the seas.

1318
01:18:17.041 --> 01:18:19.166
Never underestimate yourself. Ikal.

1319
01:18:19.666 --> 01:18:20.666
Promise?

1320
01:18:21.958 --> 01:18:22.791
Okay.

1321
01:18:24.291 --> 01:18:25.458
Are you going to miss me?

1322
01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.083
Do you know what?

1323
01:18:36.625 --> 01:18:38.708
When I lost my son…

1324
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
a big hole opened right here.

1325
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:50.291
And you remind me of him.

1326
01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:55.291
You're a brilliant young man.

1327
01:18:55.375 --> 01:18:56.500
Don't forget that.

1328
01:18:59.208 --> 01:19:01.375
I have a present for you.
now that you can read.

1329
01:19:07.916 --> 01:19:09.166
Jules Verne.

1330
01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:10.291
It's my favorite.

1331
01:19:17.958 --> 01:19:18.958
Okay…

1332
01:19:20.041 --> 01:19:22.750
You should go.
Your mom must be waiting for you. Go on.

1333
01:19:33.541 --> 01:19:34.375
Miss…

1334
01:19:36.958 --> 01:19:37.791
thank you.

1335
01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:00.583
Are you ready?

1336
01:20:02.958 --> 01:20:03.833
Let's go.

1337
01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:06.416
Are you hungry?

1338
01:20:07.958 --> 01:20:08.833
No.

1339
01:20:10.083 --> 01:20:12.583
-If you get hungry. let me know.
-Yes. Mom.

1340
01:20:12.666 --> 01:20:14.458
Mexican National Railways

1341
01:20:14.541 --> 01:20:17.250
announce
the departure of the train heading

1342
01:20:18.208 --> 01:20:20.416

Texcoco.

1345
01:20:24.291 --> 01:20:27.333
and Mexico City. as its final destination.

1346
01:20:27.416 --> 01:20:29.416
Buenavista Station.

1347
01:20:45.041 --> 01:20:47.125
Ikal!

1348
01:20:51.958 --> 01:20:53.291
Ikal!

1349
01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:07.791
This way.

1350
01:21:12.791 --> 01:21:13.833
Ikal!

1351
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.041
Valeria!

1352
01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:20.625
Goodbye. Valeria!

1353
01:21:20.708 --> 01:21:21.625
Goodbye!

1354
01:21:25.666 --> 01:21:27.666
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

1355
01:21:29.375 --> 01:21:31.083
Goodbye. Ikal!

1356
01:21:31.666 --> 01:21:33.333
Goodbye. Tuerto!

1357
01:21:35.833 --> 01:21:37.000
Goodbye. Ikal!

1358
01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:39.791
Goodbye. Chico!

1359
01:21:44.291 --> 01:21:45.333
Ikal!

1360
01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:00.916
Quetzal…

1361
01:23:12.791 --> 01:23:13.875
Goodbye. Ikal.

1362
01:23:35.958 --> 01:23:38.750
MALINALLI TEPENEPATL
PUBLIC SCHOOL

1363
01:23:38.833 --> 01:23:41.750
-What do you think Ikal is doing?
-I'm sure he's arrived.

1364
01:23:41.833 --> 01:23:43.458
Do you think he remembers us?

1365
01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:45.833
Of course. He'll always be our friend.

1366
01:23:46.583 --> 01:23:48.291
For me. he'll always be a worm.

1367
01:23:51.541 --> 01:23:52.875
-Pakal.
-Pakal.

1368
01:23:53.583 --> 01:23:54.416
Come here.

1369
01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:55.958
-Pakal.
-Pakal.

1370
01:23:56.875 --> 01:23:58.000
Hey. gorgeous.

1371
01:24:03.083 --> 01:24:03.958
Pakal?

1372
01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.416
Good afternoon.

1373
01:24:11.625 --> 01:24:12.541
How can I help you?

1374
01:24:13.958 --> 01:24:14.958
Good afternoon.

1375
01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:17.291
Hugo…

1376
01:24:17.375 --> 01:24:18.625
Hugo Valenzuela.

1377
01:24:20.166 --> 01:24:21.000
The inspector.

1378
01:24:23.875 --> 01:24:25.708
Sorry for the condition of this place.

1379
01:24:26.958 --> 01:24:29.708
Ever since the principal died.
the school went downhill.

1380
01:24:30.333 --> 01:24:33.583
And. as you can see.
the school needs lots of resources.

1381
01:24:34.083 --> 01:24:36.500
-Was it a long time ago?
-What?

1382
01:24:36.583 --> 01:24:38.416
The passing of the principal.

1383
01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:40.500
It will be seven years in January.

1384
01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:48.208
Look…

1385
01:24:55.083 --> 01:24:56.625
You came to close down the school.

1386
01:24:58.041 --> 01:25:00.708
Don't take it badly. It's part of

1387
01:25:01.583 --> 01:25:03.291
a development plan.

1388
01:25:12.166 --> 01:25:13.541
Where did you get this?

1389
01:25:19.333 --> 01:25:21.333
It was in the file.

1390
01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:31.708
Damn Worm!

1391
01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:36.333
I'm sorry.

1392
01:25:37.041 --> 01:25:37.958
Forgive me.

1393
01:25:51.375 --> 01:25:53.458
I studied agricultural engineering.

1394
01:25:56.250 --> 01:25:59.458
But I came back. and I decided
to take charge of the school.

1395
01:26:04.166 --> 01:26:06.166
What happened to Quetzal?

1396
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:08.458
He died of old age.

1397
01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:10.875
And the little dog
that you saw at the school

1398
01:26:10.958 --> 01:26:11.916
is called Pakal.

1399
01:26:12.708 --> 01:26:13.791
He's his grandson.

1400
01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:18.583
Why did you change your name?

1401
01:26:19.416 --> 01:26:21.041
After what happened to my dad.

1402
01:26:21.875 --> 01:26:23.291
when we arrived in the city…

1403
01:26:25.375 --> 01:26:26.583
I wanted to vanish.

1404
01:26:26.666 --> 01:26:28.166
You obviously succeeded.

1405
01:26:37.166 --> 01:26:38.416
TOMÁS MACHUCA LIES HERE
R.I.P.

1406
01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:39.875
Well. my middle name is Hugo

1407
01:26:39.958 --> 01:26:42.291
and my mom's maiden name is Valenzuela.

1408
01:26:43.958 --> 01:26:46.708
That's why we need two names
and two last names. right?

1409
01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:47.875
You never know.

1410
01:26:49.291 --> 01:26:50.916
Hey. and where is Tuerto?

1411
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.416
Where do you think?

1412
01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:54.791
Operating a train. right?

1413
01:27:00.875 --> 01:27:01.875
Hey. and…

1414
01:27:04.041 --> 01:27:05.833
you won't tell me anything about Chico?

1415
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:08.875
What do you want me to tell you?

1416
01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:11.833
He was in the newspaper.

1417
01:27:13.708 --> 01:27:16.083
They said it was a fight among thieves.

1418
01:27:16.916 --> 01:27:18.750
but we all know who killed him.

1419
01:27:28.291 --> 01:27:29.833
What will you do now?

1420
01:27:29.916 --> 01:27:31.541
Are there vacancies at the school?

1421
01:27:32.125 --> 01:27:33.416
They'll close it down.

1422
01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.375
I don't know who. I won't.

1423
01:27:35.458 --> 01:27:36.583
You'll get fired.

1424
01:27:36.666 --> 01:27:37.500
Fine by me.

1425
01:27:38.666 --> 01:27:40.791
I didn't study education to do this.

1426
01:27:41.375 --> 01:27:42.500
I studied to teach.

1427
01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:51.625
There's something for you.

1428
01:28:21.708 --> 01:28:23.958
Don't look at me like that. Ikal.

1429
01:28:24.625 --> 01:28:25.500
Come here.

1430
01:28:26.875 --> 01:28:27.833
This is for you.

1431
01:28:29.833 --> 01:28:30.750
Open it.

1432
01:28:35.125 --> 01:28:36.666
Read what it says there.

1433
01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:38.458
And don't tell me you have forgotten.

1434
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:41.958
"For the triton.

1435
01:28:43.583 --> 01:28:44.791
Ikal Machuca."

1436
01:29:03.125 --> 01:29:04.000
Thank you.

1437
01:29:20.166 --> 01:29:22.875
Pepe. what did we say? Come on this side.

1438
01:29:34.708 --> 01:29:36.541
Sir. may I show you my homework?

1439
01:29:36.625 --> 01:29:39.125
You'll show it to me after recess. Yes?

1440
01:29:39.208 --> 01:29:40.041
Yes. sir.

1441
01:29:40.583 --> 01:29:41.500
-Be careful.
-Yes.
