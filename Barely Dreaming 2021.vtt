(light eerie music)

6
00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:05.456
- Aw.

7
00:02:05.456 --> 00:02:07.873
Aw. Gus-Gus. such a good boy.

8
00:02:09.347 --> 00:02:10.347
Gus-Gus. aw.

9
00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:14.005
That's a good boy. Gus-Gus.

00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:16.588
(dogs panting)

11
00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:19.902
Hey. my boy.

12
00:02:19.902 --> 00:02:21.962
- Hey. Cameron. can you
guys turn it down a scooch?

13
00:02:21.962 --> 00:02:23.962
I'm gonna give your dad a call.

14
00:02:23.962 --> 00:02:25.329
- [Cameron] Such a good boy.

15
00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:26.163
Yeah. hm.

16
00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:30.754
(phone ringing)

17
00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:33.442
(dogs panting)

18
00:02:33.442 --> 00:02:34.613
- [Keith] Hey. babe.

19
00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:36.442
- Hey. honey. what's your ETA?

20
00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:38.194
- [Keith] Probably 10. 15.

21
00:02:38.194 --> 00:02:41.242
- Okay. good. we're about
10 minutes out ourselves.

22
00:02:41.242 --> 00:02:42.642
- [Keith] How's Cam doing?

23
00:02:42.642 --> 00:02:44.063
- Ah. he's good.

24
00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:45.402
He knows that Gus-Gus and Wembley

25
00:02:45.402 --> 00:02:48.944
need a little more practice if
they're gonna win next year.

26
00:02:48.944 --> 00:02:50.411
- [Keith] Thata boy.

27
00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:51.834
What about our little lady?

28
00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:53.733
- Oh. man. she's awake right
now and I tell you what.

29
00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:55.434
earlier. ugh. it felt like she was doing

30
00:02:55.434 --> 00:02:56.802
backstrokes in there.

31
00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:57.914
I was dyin'!

32
00:02:57.914 --> 00:03:00.389
(Paige giggling)

33
00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.960
- Hey. Dad. did Uncle
Adrian's gift come in?

34
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.229
- Babe. did you hear that?

35
00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:06.629
- [Keith] Yeah. buddy. I got right here.

36
00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.848
I heard you guys put on a real good show.

37
00:03:08.848 --> 00:03:11.187
- Yeah. pretty good I guess.

38
00:03:11.187 --> 00:03:12.268
- [Keith] Sorry I couldn't be there. Cam.

39
00:03:12.268 --> 00:03:15.566
I'm sorry. these guys just
they flew in for this meeting.

40
00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:17.207
I had to be there.

41
00:03:17.207 --> 00:03:19.259
I'm sorry I couldn't get out of it.

42
00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:20.197
- It's okay. Dad.

43
00:03:20.197 --> 00:03:21.939
You're allowed one miss.

44
00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.156
- [Keith] It'll be the last miss.

45
00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:27.812
- Keith. so Clara is
already over at Adrian's.

46
00:03:27.812 --> 00:03:30.201
- Yeah.
- And you know how she is.

47
00:03:30.201 --> 00:03:31.913
- [Keith] Uh. she's good for it.

48
00:03:31.913 --> 00:03:35.120
- Okay. well. actually I'm about
to Adrian's road right now.

49
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.281
You know how tricky it can be for me.

50
00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:39.612
I'm gonna go ahead and get off here.

51
00:03:39.612 --> 00:03:40.700
- [Keith] You got it.

52
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.533
- Okay. love you.

53
00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:43.260
Drive safe.
- Love y'all.

54
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.343
See you soon.

55
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.460
- Hey. Cameron. we're almost there.

56
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.340
- It's okay. Gus-Gus and Wembley.

57
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.340
We'll win next year. don't worry.

58
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.340
(light eerie music)

59
00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:09.481
- [Paige] Okay. Cameron.
you guys need to make sure

60
00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:11.299
to go in nice and quiet. okay?

61
00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.340
You know that your Uncle Adrian

62
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.090
isn't feeling too well right now.

63
00:04:18.902 --> 00:04:23.397
- [Popeye] I said. what are
you gonna do about it. huh?

64
00:04:23.397 --> 00:04:26.397
- Arm please and you know the drill.

65
00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:34.100
Adrian. how many times are you
gonna read that blasted book?

66
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.948
- Not enough.

67
00:04:35.948 --> 00:04:37.620
I just keep finding fixes.

68
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.060
(air hissing)

69
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.668
- I think you'd know
it well enough by now.

70
00:04:41.668 --> 00:04:43.278
you wrote the thing.

71
00:04:43.278 --> 00:04:45.997
- Clara does the same
thing with her paintings.

72
00:04:45.997 --> 00:04:47.664
- Guilty as charged.

73
00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:53.957
(air hissing)

74
00:04:53.957 --> 00:04:56.808
- All right. Cheryl. let's
turn things on you now.

75
00:04:56.808 --> 00:04:57.928
You gonna give Robert that tool set

76
00:04:57.928 --> 00:05:00.478
or you just gonna keep
sitting on it forever?

77
00:05:00.478 --> 00:05:03.948
- Our anniversary isn't for
another week. Mr. Smartypants.

78
00:05:03.948 --> 00:05:06.177
(Velcro ripping)

79
00:05:06.177 --> 00:05:08.209
- You should've written
Monette out of the book.

80
00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:10.757
and put in that mysterious girl
you dated 10 years ago that

81
00:05:10.757 --> 00:05:15.128
you're always talking about.
whose name still nobody knows.

82
00:05:15.128 --> 00:05:17.961
(Adrian coughing)

83
00:05:19.808 --> 00:05:22.077
He writes in his terrible
ex-wife. Monette.

84
00:05:22.077 --> 00:05:24.488
and the girl he's really into
never makes an appearance

85
00:05:24.488 --> 00:05:26.957
in any of his books for some reason.

86
00:05:26.957 --> 00:05:30.947
And I'm his sister and
I can't get a mention.

87
00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:34.048
- Well. she may not appear
in any of his books.

88
00:05:34.048 --> 00:05:37.298
but Shannon shows up in a dream or two.

89
00:05:42.787 --> 00:05:43.954
- Oh. Shannon.

90
00:05:45.707 --> 00:05:47.624
We finally have a name.

91
00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:52.683
- You do realize you talk
in your sleep. right?

92
00:05:55.168 --> 00:05:56.547
- [Cameron] Uncle Adrian.

93
00:05:56.547 --> 00:05:59.787
- [Adrian] Hey. hey.
Cameron. how'd you guys do?

94
00:05:59.787 --> 00:06:01.277
- Not so hot.

95
00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:04.075
They seem to forget everything
when everyone is watching.

96
00:06:04.075 --> 00:06:05.725
- Like what?

97
00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:07.576
- They forgot how to shake hands.

98
00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:08.409
- No.

99
00:06:09.877 --> 00:06:10.710
Let's see.

100
00:06:12.576 --> 00:06:13.659
- Sit. shake.

101
00:06:16.485 --> 00:06:17.318
Good boy.

102
00:06:19.565 --> 00:06:20.898
Shake. good boy.

103
00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:26.445
Now they do it.

104
00:06:26.445 --> 00:06:28.056
- He's being stubborn again.

105
00:06:28.056 --> 00:06:29.765
- His usual.
- Mm hm.

106
00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:31.757
- So. tell me. how did it go?

107
00:06:31.757 --> 00:06:32.917
- So. it went.

108
00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:35.438
The buddies were pretty excited

109
00:06:35.438 --> 00:06:37.405
and everything basically
went out the window.

110
00:06:37.405 --> 00:06:38.964
- Hey. Wembley.
- Oh. man.

111
00:06:38.964 --> 00:06:40.804
Well. Cameron seems to
be taking it really well.

112
00:06:40.804 --> 00:06:42.604
- Yeah. he's a trooper.

113
00:06:42.604 --> 00:06:43.563
- Where's Keith?

114
00:06:43.563 --> 00:06:44.793
I thought he was coming.

115
00:06:44.793 --> 00:06:45.764
- Oh. he's on his way.

116
00:06:45.764 --> 00:06:47.364
He should be here any minute.

117
00:06:47.364 --> 00:06:48.481
- I'm actually gonna go
out into the other room

118
00:06:48.481 --> 00:06:49.764
to finish up these charts.

119
00:06:49.764 --> 00:06:50.757
- Okay.
- But it was really good

120
00:06:50.757 --> 00:06:53.507
to see you guys.
- Thanks. Cheryl.

121
00:06:54.804 --> 00:06:57.276
Thanks for taking care
of our wacky brother.

122
00:06:57.276 --> 00:06:59.268
- Of course.
- How are you doing today?

123
00:06:59.268 --> 00:07:00.598
Are you eating?

124
00:07:00.598 --> 00:07:01.431
- Yeah.

125
00:07:02.668 --> 00:07:03.668
Looks like you've been eating.

126
00:07:03.668 --> 00:07:05.017
- Yeah.
- Hey. Dad.

127
00:07:05.017 --> 00:07:06.447
- Stop.

128
00:07:06.447 --> 00:07:07.697
Oh. hey. honey.

129
00:07:08.927 --> 00:07:10.396
- Hey.

130
00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.268
- Hey. Keith.

131
00:07:12.268 --> 00:07:14.007
The snow all melted yet?

132
00:07:14.007 --> 00:07:15.697
- Yeah. you know Highway 55?

133
00:07:15.697 --> 00:07:18.199
There was some up there near
Cascade. but Payette River.

134
00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.919
it was really up right now.

135
00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:21.580
- Really?

136
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.249
Man. it seems like that
river is either always up

137
00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:26.220
at the wrong time or always
down at the wrong time.

138
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.138
- Uncle Adrian. I know your birthday isn't

139
00:07:28.138 --> 00:07:31.969
for another month. but I couldn't wait.

140
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:33.938
- [Adrian] What's this?

141
00:07:33.938 --> 00:07:35.659
- I saved up and bought it myself.

142
00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:36.659
Huh. Dad?
- Sure did.

143
00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:38.078
- Yeah.

144
00:07:38.078 --> 00:07:40.049
He saw it in one of those
little shoppers on our flight

145
00:07:40.049 --> 00:07:42.689
in January and he knew
you just had to have it.

146
00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:43.939
- What is this?

147
00:07:46.127 --> 00:07:46.960
Wow.

148
00:07:50.148 --> 00:07:52.885
- Wow. I'd have to sell a six by nine

149
00:07:52.885 --> 00:07:55.687
oil painting to buy that.

150
00:07:55.687 --> 00:07:56.520
- I love it.

151
00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.257
I can't wait to write something with it.

152
00:08:00.257 --> 00:08:05.119
In fact. I might write
something with it tonight.

153
00:08:05.119 --> 00:08:07.377
Thanks a lot. Cameron. I really like it.

154
00:08:07.377 --> 00:08:08.719
- You're welcome.

155
00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:10.266
- All right. gang. it's getting late.

156
00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:11.359
We have a late night tonight.

157
00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:12.192
We gotta get ready for

158
00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:13.677
work and school tomorrow.
- Yeah.

159
00:08:13.677 --> 00:08:14.510
- All right.
- All right. sounds good.

160
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.753
- I'll see you next time.
- All right. I'll catch up

161
00:08:15.753 --> 00:08:19.141
with you this weekend.
- You got it. Keith.

162
00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:19.974
- Thanks for reminding me.

163
00:08:19.974 --> 00:08:20.893
I have six packages I have

164
00:08:20.893 --> 00:08:22.590
to get ready for tomorrow morning.

165
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.213
- Oh. your business is picking up. huh?

166
00:08:24.213 --> 00:08:25.253
- Oh. yeah.
- I'm gonna head out

167
00:08:25.253 --> 00:08:27.231
with them; I'm gonna bum off some of their

168
00:08:27.231 --> 00:08:29.733
turkey slow roasted chili
that's been going all morning.

169
00:08:29.733 --> 00:08:30.710
- Ah.

170
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.812
- Don't think that I forgot.
- No.

171
00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:34.312
- Truth comes out.

172
00:08:34.312 --> 00:08:36.763
- Well. you know I always
bring you your leftovers.

173
00:08:36.763 --> 00:08:37.846
- You better.

174
00:08:38.692 --> 00:08:41.020
All right. I'll see you next time.

175
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.865
- All right. have a good night. Bye.

176
00:08:43.763 --> 00:08:45.013
- Paige. Paige.

177
00:08:48.643 --> 00:08:50.661
- What's up. what?

178
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:51.781
What is it?

179
00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:54.213
- I'm thinking about
working on something new.

180
00:08:54.213 --> 00:08:55.189
- Okay.
- It may not be down

181
00:08:55.189 --> 00:08:57.283
in manuscript form as soon I'd like.

182
00:08:57.283 --> 00:09:00.616
but well. just in case something happens

183
00:09:02.672 --> 00:09:04.901
and it doesn't get finished.

184
00:09:04.901 --> 00:09:07.761
No. don't do that. don't do that.

185
00:09:07.761 --> 00:09:10.990
- All right.
- We're not going there yet.

186
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.651
- What is it about?

187
00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:15.460
- Adrian can't sleep.
that's what it's about.

188
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.790
- You still can't sleep. even
with all this pain medication?

189
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.801
- Oh. nevermind that. this is special.

190
00:09:20.801 --> 00:09:23.249
It's nonfiction this time.

191
00:09:23.249 --> 00:09:24.371
Heck. you might even like it.

192
00:09:24.371 --> 00:09:25.521
- [Keith] Paige. you ready to head out?

193
00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:26.569
- Yeah. I'm coming. honey.

194
00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:27.620
I gotta get going.

195
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.089
- All right. I'll see you next time.

196
00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:30.740
- All right. have a good night.

197
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.990
- Tomorrow.
- Okay. bye-bye.

198
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.569
(light music)

199
00:09:42.569 --> 00:09:44.630
- [Bud] The opportunity will come again

200
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.070
for you to see her again.

201
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.160
- I can't go there.
- Let it happen.

202
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.410
- Hey. you ready for your evening shot?

203
00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.430
- I guess I have no choice.

204
00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:00.140
- You sure. you usually turn me down.

205
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.140
I'm shocked.

206
00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:06.308
- Okay. well. since I'm
getting my way today I guess.

207
00:10:06.308 --> 00:10:07.699
- Well. not that much of a way.

208
00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:10.028
Do you want some melatonin
to help you sleep?

209
00:10:10.028 --> 00:10:11.148
- Nah. I'm good.

210
00:10:11.148 --> 00:10:12.999
I'm not in pain right now.

211
00:10:12.999 --> 00:10:13.832
- Whiskey?

212
00:10:15.388 --> 00:10:16.221
- No.

213
00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:18.250
- Lullaby?

214
00:10:19.617 --> 00:10:21.537
- Now that one's kinda tempting.

215
00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:22.370
- Oh. please don't.

216
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.407
I really can't sing.

217
00:10:23.407 --> 00:10:24.799
- Yeah. I've heard you sing before.

218
00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:25.748
- Yeah.

219
00:10:25.748 --> 00:10:28.081
- Nah. I'm good.
- All right.

220
00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:32.239
Well. Mr. Stubborn. at some
point you and I are gonna have

221
00:10:32.239 --> 00:10:33.727
a conversation about you secretly

222
00:10:33.727 --> 00:10:37.285
quitting your chemo and your radiation.

223
00:10:37.285 --> 00:10:42.202
Now you're not even using the
light duty stuff to help you.

224
00:10:43.527 --> 00:10:45.039
Are you sure you don't want something

225
00:10:45.039 --> 00:10:47.247
to help you sleep tonight?

226
00:10:47.247 --> 00:10:48.914
- No thanks. Cheryl.

227
00:10:50.598 --> 00:10:54.617
I'm gonna be sleeping real good tonight.

228
00:10:54.617 --> 00:10:55.450
- Okay.

229
00:10:56.999 --> 00:11:00.148
I'll come back in later before
I go home for my own sleep

230
00:11:00.148 --> 00:11:05.056
just to check in case you
change your mind. okay?

231
00:11:05.056 --> 00:11:05.889
All right.

232
00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:10.517
- Hey. Cheryl.
- Yeah?

233
00:11:11.617 --> 00:11:16.534
- If I woulda had three sisters.
you woulda been the third.

234
00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:22.637
(light ethereal music)

235
00:12:04.267 --> 00:12:07.237
- [Man] All right. let's go.

236
00:12:07.237 --> 00:12:08.918
When we get there. I want
you guys to wait for me

237
00:12:08.918 --> 00:12:10.278
at the end of the road.

238
00:12:10.278 --> 00:12:12.689
Wait for me. I'm going in alone.

239
00:12:12.689 --> 00:12:14.106
I wanna find him.

240
00:12:15.283 --> 00:12:17.837
- Yeah. do we?
(soft music)

241
00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:20.420
(man laughing)

242
00:12:28.835 --> 00:12:32.752
- [Woman] His mother
must've been a good woman.

243
00:12:48.832 --> 00:12:51.499
(phone ringing)

244
00:12:52.853 --> 00:12:57.015
- [Man] I wanted to do
something. but I couldn't.

245
00:12:57.015 --> 00:12:59.426
- [Paige] Hey. Cheryl.

246
00:12:59.426 --> 00:13:01.775
- Do me a favor and take
care of that little one

247
00:13:01.775 --> 00:13:03.858
and sit down first. okay?

248
00:13:07.426 --> 00:13:09.259
Yeah. he's. he's gone.

249
00:13:11.866 --> 00:13:14.575
(somber music)

250
00:13:14.575 --> 00:13:15.408
- How?

251
00:13:16.575 --> 00:13:17.967
(Paige crying)

252
00:13:17.967 --> 00:13:19.676
I don't understand. we were just there.

253
00:13:19.676 --> 00:13:22.259
He was fine when we were there.

254
00:13:25.814 --> 00:13:27.064
- I'm so sorry.

255
00:13:28.786 --> 00:13:30.644
(Paige crying)

256
00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:32.226
- Okay. thank you. Cheryl.

257
00:13:32.226 --> 00:13:33.354
Thanks for calling.

258
00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:35.937
(somber music)

259
00:13:50.124 --> 00:13:53.351
(Cheryl sniffling)

260
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:56.768
(somber music continues)

261
00:14:24.068 --> 00:14:26.230
- Is it gonna fit okay?
- Yeah. it's gonna fit great.

262
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.711
Thanks.
- You got that. sis?

263
00:14:27.711 --> 00:14:28.929
- I do.

264
00:14:28.929 --> 00:14:30.209
Did you know he had this trunk?

265
00:14:30.209 --> 00:14:31.271
- I was actually just thinking that.

266
00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:32.500
I've never noticed it before.

267
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.489
- That's so odd. it was just
in the closet with his shoes.

268
00:14:35.489 --> 00:14:37.849
But that does remind me of this.

269
00:14:37.849 --> 00:14:39.540
Last night when I went
in after he was gone.

270
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.380
- What's this?
- It was on his nightstand

271
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.900
addressed to both of you.
- How weird.

272
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.109
- [Clara] You don't know what it is?

273
00:14:44.109 --> 00:14:44.942
- I have no idea.

274
00:14:44.942 --> 00:14:45.951
I've never seen it before.

275
00:14:45.951 --> 00:14:48.720
- Did you know about this?
- No. not at all.

276
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.484
Go ahead and give it an open.

277
00:14:50.484 --> 00:14:51.317
- Okay.

278
00:14:51.317 --> 00:14:54.234
(letter crinkling)

279
00:14:58.623 --> 00:15:01.113
"Paige. I wanted to
make sure you and Clara

280
00:15:01.113 --> 00:15:05.084
got this before the publishing people do.

281
00:15:05.084 --> 00:15:07.223
When you're ready. there's
something in the trunk.

282
00:15:07.223 --> 00:15:08.973
You'll know. Adrian."

283
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.177
So mysterious.

284
00:15:13.764 --> 00:15:15.052
- Thanks. Cheryl.

285
00:15:15.052 --> 00:15:16.490
- [Paige] He gave us
a homework assignment.

286
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:21.063
- He was so mysterious.
- I was just thinking that.

287
00:15:21.063 --> 00:15:24.742
- I guess he has one more
chase for you guys to solve.

288
00:15:24.742 --> 00:15:26.302
- [Paige] Yeah.

289
00:15:26.302 --> 00:15:29.843
- Speaking of mystery. where
is it that you're headed next?

290
00:15:29.843 --> 00:15:31.284
- Pinecliffs Medical Center.

291
00:15:31.284 --> 00:15:34.473
They were trying to get me to
work for them for months. but-

292
00:15:34.473 --> 00:15:36.792
- That's right.
- I didn't wanna leave Adrian.

293
00:15:36.792 --> 00:15:37.953
It didn't feel right.

294
00:15:37.953 --> 00:15:42.833
So. I'll start next week
and complete change of pace.

295
00:15:42.833 --> 00:15:44.593
Post-op care.
- Oh. wow.

296
00:15:44.593 --> 00:15:46.695
- Yeah.
- Yeah. a lot different.

297
00:15:46.695 --> 00:15:48.633
- A little easier on the heartstrings.

298
00:15:48.633 --> 00:15:50.532
- [Paige] Well. they're
gonna be lucky to have you.

299
00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:51.935
We have been.
- Yeah.

300
00:15:51.935 --> 00:15:54.821
We really appreciate everything
you've done for Adrian.

301
00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:56.752
- Let me know when services are. okay?

302
00:15:56.752 --> 00:15:58.503
- We will.
- Of course.

303
00:15:58.503 --> 00:16:00.343
- I wouldn't wanna miss that.
- Thank you so much.

304
00:16:00.343 --> 00:16:01.903
We'll see you soon. Cheryl.

305
00:16:01.903 --> 00:16:03.073
- Absolutely. you guys.

306
00:16:03.073 --> 00:16:06.682
You take care and take care of that one.

307
00:16:06.682 --> 00:16:09.265
(somber music)

308
00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:26.821
- It's okay. bud.

309
00:16:26.821 --> 00:16:27.654
It's okay.

310
00:16:40.712 --> 00:16:43.101
(Paige sighs)

311
00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:46.518
(somber music continues)

312
00:17:13.472 --> 00:17:16.472
(light eerie music)

313
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.647
- We appreciate it.
- Yeah.

314
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.123
Whoa.

315
00:17:42.901 --> 00:17:44.560
- [Paige] It's a lotta stuff. huh?

316
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.800
- [Clara] That's a lotta stuff.

317
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.592
- Oh. it's not that bad.

318
00:17:49.592 --> 00:17:50.703
But now you know why I need to get here

319
00:17:50.703 --> 00:17:52.477
and just organize it.

320
00:17:52.477 --> 00:17:54.549
It'll help take my mind off of things.

321
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:57.216
(phone ringing)

322
00:17:58.368 --> 00:18:00.259
- I have to take this.
- Okay.

323
00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:02.176
Yeah. go ahead.
- Hello?

324
00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:04.048
This is she.

325
00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:06.877
By tomorrow?

326
00:18:08.869 --> 00:18:09.702
Okay.

327
00:18:10.819 --> 00:18:12.477
Yeah. I can get it done.

328
00:18:12.477 --> 00:18:13.539
Okay. thanks.

329
00:18:13.539 --> 00:18:14.372
Bye.

330
00:18:15.357 --> 00:18:16.779
- Don't tell me you're leaving me.

331
00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:19.048
- I have to complete my
commission by tomorrow.

332
00:18:19.048 --> 00:18:20.139
- Okay.
- I'm gonna have to go.

333
00:18:20.139 --> 00:18:20.972
- All right.

334
00:18:20.972 --> 00:18:22.669
- Let me know if you need
help with anything. okay?

335
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:23.998
- Okay. I'll get started on it.

336
00:18:23.998 --> 00:18:26.298
I appreciate you trying.
- Okay.

337
00:18:26.298 --> 00:18:27.678
- Thank you. good luck.
- Bye.

338
00:18:27.678 --> 00:18:29.099

- Thanks.

339
00:18:29.099 --> 00:18:30.931
- Be safe.
- I will.

340
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:33.431
(Paige sighs)

341
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.171
- "I wanted to make sure you and Clara

342
00:18:38.171 --> 00:18:41.000

(marble clinking)

349
00:19:40.468 --> 00:19:42.218
What's that clicking?

350
00:19:44.628 --> 00:19:47.878
(soft music continues)

351
00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:14.289
Look how young you look.

00:21:19.329 --> 00:21:20.329
What's that?

357
00:21:28.409 --> 00:21:29.242
Adrian.

358
00:21:44.677 --> 00:21:47.427
(latch clicking)

359
00:21:56.656 --> 00:21:59.406
"Working title that I don't like.

360
00:22:01.048 --> 00:22:04.548
Wonderland. Utopia. Melancholy and Terror.

361
00:22:09.049 --> 00:22:10.549
By Adrian Aytese."

362
00:22:11.948 --> 00:22:14.448
(Paige sighs)

363
00:22:30.988 --> 00:22:34.571
"Forward.
(Paige sniffling)

364
00:22:39.913 --> 00:22:44.724
Not more than one hour ago.
my special nephew. Cameron-

365
00:22:44.724 --> 00:22:47.307
(Paige crying)

366
00:22:48.196 --> 00:22:51.876
Cameron gave me the best
gift I've ever received.

367
00:22:51.876 --> 00:22:56.376
this pen that instantly
inspired me to write this out.

368
00:23:00.225 --> 00:23:01.897
This journal book has sat with

369
00:23:01.897 --> 00:23:04.238
empty pages since 2019."
- Empty pages since 2019.

370
00:23:04.238 --> 00:23:07.814
at which time I intended to
materialize a bizarre experience

371
00:23:07.814 --> 00:23:10.838
as well as a tender. yet
horrific reality from seven years

372
00:23:10.838 --> 00:23:13.878
before that in descriptive words.

373
00:23:13.878 --> 00:23:15.497
However. I just couldn't.

374
00:23:15.497 --> 00:23:17.405
What is so vividly ingrained in my memory

375
00:23:17.405 --> 00:23:20.845
from the two most unforgettable
experiences of my life.

376
00:23:20.845 --> 00:23:24.158
were also the ones that I
couldn't bring myself to share.

377
00:23:24.158 --> 00:23:26.278
Historically. I write fiction.

378
00:23:26.278 --> 00:23:29.537
so I don't have to face some realities.

379
00:23:29.537 --> 00:23:32.620
The mask is off the pen. so to speak.

380
00:23:34.846 --> 00:23:37.324
Barely two years ago on the
tail end of winter in early

381
00:23:37.324 --> 00:23:41.206
March of 2019. a simple visit
with my friend and neighbor.

382
00:23:41.206 --> 00:23:44.278
Bud Millen. changed everything since.

383
00:23:44.278 --> 00:23:46.697
I was still healthy as I knew me to be.

384
00:23:46.697 --> 00:23:48.828
yet feeling terrible
from the chronic insomnia

385
00:23:48.828 --> 00:23:51.948
that has owned me since always.

386
00:23:51.948 --> 00:23:54.937
As an educated. well-traveled.
and intuitive man.

387
00:23:54.937 --> 00:23:57.678
Bud knew this. especially
since I complained to him

388
00:23:57.678 --> 00:24:00.366
with it every time I'm working on a book.

389
00:24:00.366 --> 00:24:02.485
Sitting by the warm fire at his house.

390
00:24:02.485 --> 00:24:05.125
he easily perceived
something not completely free

391
00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:08.332
of destruction with me that day.

392
00:24:08.332 --> 00:24:10.286
(fire place creaking)

393
00:24:10.286 --> 00:24:13.434
(Bud groaning)

394
00:24:13.434 --> 00:24:18.351
- Adrian. remember. never.
never. ever. ever. ever get old.

395
00:24:21.777 --> 00:24:25.113
- I'm already getting there. Bud.

396
00:24:25.113 --> 00:24:26.958
- No. you're not. no. no.

397
00:24:26.958 --> 00:24:27.798
(Bud chuckling)

398
00:24:27.798 --> 00:24:30.057
God. you think you're old?

399
00:24:30.057 --> 00:24:30.890
No.

400
00:24:35.667 --> 00:24:37.377
What is it?

401
00:24:37.377 --> 00:24:38.427
You're not happy.

402
00:24:38.427 --> 00:24:40.006
You're not like you're usually are.

403
00:24:40.006 --> 00:24:42.497
You just finished a book. haven't you?

404
00:24:42.497 --> 00:24:45.756
- Yeah. the scary part is it's
actually doing pretty good.

405
00:24:45.756 --> 00:24:49.754
- Yeah. but normally when
you finish a book you're.

406
00:24:49.754 --> 00:24:52.171
you're happy. you're excited.

407
00:24:53.294 --> 00:24:54.924
Aren't you looking forward to it?

408
00:24:54.924 --> 00:24:56.154
- Yeah. I mean. it's good.

409
00:24:56.154 --> 00:24:58.271
I mean. the book's doing about
as well as can be expected.

410
00:24:58.271 --> 00:24:59.703
but-
- No. no. no. no.

411
00:24:59.703 --> 00:25:00.702
I've never seen you like this.

412
00:25:00.702 --> 00:25:03.619
I've seen you on a number of books.

413
00:25:04.594 --> 00:25:06.935
You're not. what is it?

414
00:25:06.935 --> 00:25:08.244
Come on. tell me.
- No. it's actually doing

415
00:25:08.244 --> 00:25:09.834
better than I expected it would do.

416
00:25:09.834 --> 00:25:11.404
- Are you dreaming?

417
00:25:11.404 --> 00:25:12.983
Is something bothering you?

418
00:25:12.983 --> 00:25:14.065
- No.
- What. no. well.

419
00:25:14.065 --> 00:25:15.505
if you're not sleeping. are you dreaming?

420
00:25:15.505 --> 00:25:16.802
Are you having bad dreams. what?

421
00:25:16.802 --> 00:25:17.635
- Oh. of course you know me.

422
00:25:17.635 --> 00:25:19.181
Every time I write a book. I can't sleep.

423
00:25:19.181 --> 00:25:21.782
But when usually when the book is done...

424
00:25:21.782 --> 00:25:23.401
- Sometimes dreams can help you. you know?

425
00:25:23.401 --> 00:25:27.818
They can. a good dream can
make you feel really good.

426
00:25:30.753 --> 00:25:35.121
- Yeah. okay. and how do
you just make those happen?

427
00:25:35.121 --> 00:25:38.540
- Well. I don't make those happen.

428
00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.957
Um. (sighs).

429
00:25:42.642 --> 00:25:46.414
You know. I've done these
archeological digs. right?

430
00:25:46.414 --> 00:25:48.672
- Yeah and I was looking
at your picture earlier.

431
00:25:48.672 --> 00:25:49.741
This is one I haven't seen.

432
00:25:49.741 --> 00:25:52.254
Did you just find this and
bring this out or something?

433
00:25:52.254 --> 00:25:54.622
- I don't know.
- I haven't seen this one yet.

434
00:25:54.622 --> 00:25:57.593
- You know. I've dug in
Panama and Costa Rica

435
00:25:57.593 --> 00:26:00.593
and New Mexico. Arizona. but I also.

436
00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:06.811
I dug something else out that
just might be of help to you.

437
00:26:10.724 --> 00:26:12.964
- Like a fossil or something?

438
00:26:12.964 --> 00:26:14.524
- What are you gonna do.
are you gonna eat a fossil?

439
00:26:14.524 --> 00:26:17.191
(Bud chuckling)

440
00:26:19.025 --> 00:26:20.785
Now. this is between you and me.

441
00:26:20.785 --> 00:26:25.133
And I'm not gonna tell you
which one I dug it from.

442
00:26:25.133 --> 00:26:27.372
I'm gonna give you some.

443
00:26:27.372 --> 00:26:28.622
A little pouch.

444
00:26:29.881 --> 00:26:31.214
Here. hold that.

445
00:26:36.634 --> 00:26:38.801
Now. do not take too much.

446
00:26:42.025 --> 00:26:46.083
I. I. um. when I found out it
was safe and wasn't poisonous

447
00:26:46.083 --> 00:26:47.666
I tried a teaspoon.

448
00:26:50.252 --> 00:26:53.623
I didn't know where I was for two days.

449
00:26:53.623 --> 00:26:55.785
- Um.
- Quarter of a teaspoon.

450
00:26:55.785 --> 00:26:57.834
The tiniest amount.

451
00:26:57.834 --> 00:27:01.624
It's fine. it's not
poisonous. it's healthy.

452
00:27:01.624 --> 00:27:02.774
It'll make you relax.

453
00:27:02.774 --> 00:27:05.875
It'll make you sleep again
like you used to sleep.

454
00:27:05.875 --> 00:27:08.708
but it also gives you nice dreams.

455
00:27:11.406 --> 00:27:14.534
Good dreams. very. very special dreams.

456
00:27:14.534 --> 00:27:16.596
- I could use that.

457
00:27:16.596 --> 00:27:19.934
Did you get this when you were doing that?

458
00:27:19.934 --> 00:27:22.184
- Um. I found it in an Oya.

459
00:27:25.796 --> 00:27:29.126
Some of the greatest pottery
every uncovered in this area.

460
00:27:29.126 --> 00:27:31.626
but we found dirt. landslides.

461
00:27:32.914 --> 00:27:35.457
all the stuff that has covered this ruin.

462
00:27:35.457 --> 00:27:37.828
we had to dig that deep
just to hit the bottom

463
00:27:37.828 --> 00:27:39.225
of the first floor.

464
00:27:39.225 --> 00:27:40.897
(door thudding)

465
00:27:40.897 --> 00:27:43.217
- [Paige] You startled me.

466
00:27:43.217 --> 00:27:45.257
- Are you okay?

467
00:27:45.257 --> 00:27:46.766
- Yeah. I'm okay.

468
00:27:46.766 --> 00:27:48.577
I'm just going through Adrian's stuff.

469
00:27:48.577 --> 00:27:51.028
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

470
00:27:51.028 --> 00:27:53.697
- Okay. if I can help you let me know.

471
00:27:53.697 --> 00:27:55.906
- I got it. thank you.

472
00:27:55.906 --> 00:27:57.217
- Okay.
- Thanks for checkin' on me.

473
00:27:57.217 --> 00:27:59.137
- Yeah. okay.
- Up until that evening.

474
00:27:59.137 --> 00:28:01.086
I wasn't exactly pumped about ingesting

475
00:28:01.086 --> 00:28:04.548
this peculiar sand powder
Bud had discovered years ago.

476
00:28:04.548 --> 00:28:07.617
but had kept secret from
the rest of the world.

477
00:28:07.617 --> 00:28:09.588
It was an afterthought until

478
00:28:09.588 --> 00:28:12.338
I had settled under the blankets.

479
00:28:14.646 --> 00:28:17.229
(Adrian sighs)

480
00:28:34.188 --> 00:28:37.188
- [Woman] All of it goes in the bag!

481
00:28:38.646 --> 00:28:39.479
Now!

482
00:28:41.006 --> 00:28:42.923
- [Man] All of it. now!

483
00:28:44.307 --> 00:28:46.126
You better move your ass.

484
00:28:46.126 --> 00:28:49.376
(light dramatic music)

485
00:28:52.926 --> 00:28:55.198
- [Woman] I'll take that.
thank you very much.

486
00:28:55.198 --> 00:28:57.497
- [Man] All right. now here's
what's gonna happen next.

487
00:28:57.497 --> 00:28:59.468
Blondie. you'll lock the front door.

488
00:28:59.468 --> 00:29:03.063
and then we're all gonna take
a field trip to the back room.

489
00:29:03.063 --> 00:29:04.230
Nice and easy.

490
00:29:05.356 --> 00:29:08.977
After all we've been through.
I still don't know your name.

491
00:29:08.977 --> 00:29:10.310
- [Kat] I'm Kat.

492
00:29:13.708 --> 00:29:16.458
- And I'm Joe.
- As in Sloppy Joe?

493
00:29:17.295 --> 00:29:18.545
- [Joe] Uh. no.

494
00:29:20.068 --> 00:29:22.495
I'm not that sloppy.

495
00:29:22.495 --> 00:29:24.646
- [Kat] Yes. yes. you are.

496
00:29:24.646 --> 00:29:25.755
I mean. look at you.
you can't even match up

497
00:29:25.755 --> 00:29:27.338
a correct gig line.

498
00:29:31.286 --> 00:29:33.453
- A gig what?
- A gig line.

499
00:29:34.383 --> 00:29:37.574
It's a military thing you do.

500
00:29:37.574 --> 00:29:39.183
My god. it's where your zipper. your belt.

501
00:29:39.183 --> 00:29:40.985
and your shirt buttons
all line up together.

502
00:29:40.985 --> 00:29:42.735
- [Man] Okay. enough.

503
00:29:45.624 --> 00:29:47.541
- [Man] Dallas. my man.

504
00:29:49.178 --> 00:29:50.762
Not a day grace to clear this up.

505
00:29:50.762 --> 00:29:53.103
(suspenseful music)

506
00:29:53.103 --> 00:29:56.155
- [Man] Find a number of lockers
there. put it one of them.

507
00:29:56.155 --> 00:29:58.028
and then you'll give the key to grand-

508
00:29:58.028 --> 00:30:01.278
(light dramatic music)

509
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:08.088
- The way we figured it.
we're 830 miles from Malibu.

510
00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:11.891
(somber music)

511
00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.399
- [Adrian] What the?

512
00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:20.339
How can that be?
- I don't wanna do this here.

513
00:30:20.339 --> 00:30:21.868
- Man. how can you be around normal people

514
00:30:21.868 --> 00:30:23.618
and still be so slow?

515
00:30:24.919 --> 00:30:27.220
What the hell's going on?
- Do this here?

516
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.111
- [Man] Need a shower on the
go no matter where you are?

517
00:30:30.111 --> 00:30:33.041
(upbeat music)

518
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:35.252
You can even use it in your
home shower to free you up

519
00:30:35.252 --> 00:30:37.502
of those pesky water hoses.

520
00:30:42.252 --> 00:30:43.981
The Silver Shower Hoseless Shower

521
00:30:43.981 --> 00:30:46.231
can get you clean anywhere.

522
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.651
It boasts a high pressure
endless stream of water

523
00:30:50.651 --> 00:30:53.901
that features multiple stream settings.

524
00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:00.487
Instant hot showers on the go
with no plugins or batteries.

525
00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.113
Take it on a vacation.

526
00:31:05.089 --> 00:31:09.089
Just 49.95 or three easy
installments for 29.95.

527
00:31:10.931 --> 00:31:13.021
Upgrade to the golden model.

528
00:31:13.021 --> 00:31:16.021

00:45:02.793 --> 00:45:04.195
just over the tracks.

768
00:45:10.674 --> 00:45:12.055
and I saw him in the meat department.

769
00:45:12.055 --> 00:45:13.223
- No. that's not where he is.

770
00:45:13.223 --> 00:45:14.603
He's over at Jack's.

771
00:45:14.603 --> 00:45:15.893
- You don't know.
- He was getting short ribs.

772
00:45:15.893 --> 00:45:18.551
- He's at Jack's.
- Ah. come on.

773
00:45:18.551 --> 00:45:20.002
- Jack doesn't have short ribs.

774
00:45:20.002 --> 00:45:21.031
Come on. you know that.
- Well. he's-

775
00:45:21.031 --> 00:45:22.566
- [Singer] Check next
time in the meat aisle.

776
00:45:22.566 --> 00:45:23.399
- [Singer] Are you guys new.

777
00:45:23.399 --> 00:45:27.222
do you know who we're talking
about? (Adrian groaning)

778
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.458
- Are you trying to fall?

779
00:45:30.458 --> 00:45:32.760
This is exactly where Shannon fell.

780
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.343
- I don't remember.

781
00:45:35.269 --> 00:45:39.167
- This is the cliff where
you proposed to Shannon.

782
00:45:39.167 --> 00:45:40.084
Right here!

783
00:45:41.288 --> 00:45:42.549
She slipped. you tried to catch her.

784
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:45.680
You couldn't. she can't
swim and you couldn't swim!

785
00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.141
- [Adrian] We can go see
the whole world again.

786
00:45:48.141 --> 00:45:49.037
(gravel crunching)
(Adrian gasping)

787
00:45:49.037 --> 00:45:50.480
Shannon!

788
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.897
Hold on!
- Adrian!

789
00:45:52.992 --> 00:45:55.192
- Shannon!
(water splashing)

790
00:45:55.192 --> 00:46:00.109
- The opportunity will come
again for you to see her again.

791
00:46:03.432 --> 00:46:04.599
Let it happen.

792
00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:08.548
Let it happen.

793
00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.490
- I don't wanna fall.
(ominous music)

794
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:14.407
- Trust me.

795
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.541
(Adrian groaning)
(water splashing)

796
00:46:21.541 --> 00:46:23.640
- [Female Robot] You
bleed so easily. Adrian.

797
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.720
(robot thudding)
(Adrian screaming)

798
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.137
Nobody loves you.

799
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.061
Shannon does not care about you.

800
00:46:30.061 --> 00:46:32.311
Stop writing books. Adrian.

801
00:46:33.181 --> 00:46:36.681
- Poor Adrian couldn't hold on to Shannon.

802
00:46:38.801 --> 00:46:40.808
Keith can't help you now.

803
00:46:40.808 --> 00:46:44.808
Keith's not here.
(man cackling)

804
00:46:47.739 --> 00:46:49.476
Bud is not your friend.

805
00:46:49.476 --> 00:46:52.989
He is why you're here.

806
00:46:52.989 --> 00:46:56.322
Monette really dodged a bullet with you.

807
00:46:57.758 --> 00:46:58.889

in the country today.

824
00:47:45.886 --> 00:47:48.219
It says. "disco takes over."

He was gonna be Santa Claus

852
00:49:01.156 --> 00:49:04.294
but his six pack was showing too much.

853
00:49:04.294 --> 00:49:05.734
And also. his hair.

854
00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:06.965
You should see his hair.

855
00:49:06.965 --> 00:49:08.548
- He looks like me.

856
00:49:09.476 --> 00:49:12.454
- Uh. no. he looks nothing like you.

857
00:49:12.454 --> 00:49:14.556
Like. can you see?

He writes books and stuff?
- Yeah. like obviously

861
00:49:21.294 --> 00:49:25.627

(light music)

862
00:49:31.276 --> 00:49:33.859
(man laughing)

863
00:49:45.305 --> 00:49:46.138
- Adrian.

864
00:49:48.956 --> 00:49:50.974
I thought I was very clear.

865
00:49:50.974 --> 00:49:53.141
We were not to meet again.

866
00:49:54.334 --> 00:49:56.145
Now it's too late.

867
00:49:56.145 --> 00:49:57.766
It's too late.

868
00:49:57.766 --> 00:49:59.933
You have no way out. none.

869
00:50:01.305 --> 00:50:03.484
You didn't have a look
in the mirror did you?

870
00:50:03.484 --> 00:50:06.294
You never looked in time.
(bell dinging)

871
00:50:06.294 --> 00:50:10.711
You never looked in a mirror
and now your time is up.

872
00:50:13.876 --> 00:50:16.305
(man sighs)

873
00:50:16.305 --> 00:50:19.138
There's only one thing you can do.

874
00:50:20.596 --> 00:50:21.846
Get some sleep.

875
00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:26.554
- Stop writing books.
(Adrian screaming)

876
00:50:26.554 --> 00:50:29.721
You bleed and cry like a baby. Adrian.

877
00:50:30.984 --> 00:50:34.484
If only Shannon could see you cry. Adrian.

878
00:50:35.324 --> 00:50:36.324
Stop living.

879
00:50:37.794 --> 00:50:40.794
(dramatic whirring)

880
00:51:22.486 --> 00:51:23.542
- [Man] Double time.

881
00:51:23.542 --> 00:51:25.938
- It's time for me to go. Adrian.

882
00:51:25.938 --> 00:51:28.700
I'm just gonna have to
leave and say farewell

883
00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.700
until we meet again.

884
00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:34.910
Goodbye. Adrian.
(somber music)

885
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:37.660
(snow crunching)

886
00:51:42.801 --> 00:51:45.468
(body thudding)

887
00:51:49.043 --> 00:51:51.793
(snow crunching)

888
00:52:03.712 --> 00:52:04.545
- Adrian?

889
00:52:09.561 --> 00:52:10.394
Adrian?

890
00:52:14.881 --> 00:52:17.214
- [Adrian] Is that a rabbit?

891
00:52:20.692 --> 00:52:23.662
- Adrian. you've got to look up.

892
00:52:23.662 --> 00:52:25.245
- [Adrian] Shannon.

893
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.533
- Hello. Adrian.

894
00:52:33.932 --> 00:52:38.702
I thought it important to come
and spend some time with you.

895
00:52:38.702 --> 00:52:42.869
Your parents and their
well wishes and their love.

896
00:52:43.772 --> 00:52:45.812
I've spent time with them.

897
00:52:45.812 --> 00:52:46.881
They're so incredibly proud of you.

898
00:52:46.881 --> 00:52:49.032
- Adrian. it's mom.

899
00:52:49.032 --> 00:52:50.841
I know you've been struggling lately.

900
00:52:50.841 --> 00:52:51.873
You should listen to the angel.

901
00:52:51.873 --> 00:52:53.652
she knows what she's talking about.

902
00:52:53.652 --> 00:52:57.142
- I'm sorry you've had
such a restless night.

903
00:52:57.142 --> 00:52:58.732
It's gotta be hard having
all those thoughts.

904
00:52:58.732 --> 00:52:59.565
all those dreams.

905
00:52:59.565 --> 00:53:00.902
- You gotta concentrate
more on your books.

906
00:53:00.902 --> 00:53:02.553
- Ignore that dream you had.

907
00:53:02.553 --> 00:53:04.062
That dream wasn't real.
- Oh. yes. you will

908
00:53:04.062 --> 00:53:06.753
have an opportunity to see Shannon.

909
00:53:06.753 --> 00:53:11.753
You two will have a very
long time to spend together.

910
00:53:11.993 --> 00:53:13.433
- Adrian. you've got to
go to sleep sometime.

911
00:53:13.433 --> 00:53:16.372
- And honey. that night
of the car accident.

912
00:53:16.372 --> 00:53:17.472
don't feel bad about that night.

913
00:53:17.472 --> 00:53:20.131
- Adrian. you stay put here now. okay?

914
00:53:20.131 --> 00:53:22.714
(somber music)

915
00:53:27.441 --> 00:53:29.024
- [Adrian] Shannon.

916
00:53:45.252 --> 00:53:47.342
- [Frank] And I would
imagine every young lady

917
00:53:47.342 --> 00:53:49.412
in this audience would be privileged

918
00:53:49.412 --> 00:53:50.590
to dance with you tonight.

919
00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:51.489
- [Jeff] Well. there are some young ladies

920
00:53:51.489 --> 00:53:53.377
in this audience that I'd
love to dance with tonight.

921
00:53:53.377 --> 00:53:54.220
In fact. I was waiting for you

922
00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.881
to ask me that question. Frank.

923
00:53:55.881 --> 00:54:00.300
- [Frank] You know. before
we invite your group

924
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:03.271
to participate and show some of the very.

925
00:54:03.271 --> 00:54:05.572
very finely tuned dance
machine. would you be willing-

926
00:54:05.572 --> 00:54:06.790
- Yeah. they're getting warmed up.

927
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:09.088
- Would you be willing to boogie with me?

928
00:54:09.088 --> 00:54:10.907
- Woo!
- Let's try it.

929
00:54:10.907 --> 00:54:12.408
- All right. let's go.
- Let's go.

930
00:54:12.408 --> 00:54:13.579
(audience applauding)

931
00:54:13.579 --> 00:54:15.147
Let 'em hang out. Jeff.
- Come on!

932
00:54:15.147 --> 00:54:18.230
(light groovy music)

933
00:54:27.728 --> 00:54:30.395
(ominous music)

934
00:55:17.219 --> 00:55:21.276
(suspenseful music)
(body thudding)

935
00:55:21.276 --> 00:55:23.943
(ominous music)

936
00:55:39.883 --> 00:55:41.323
- [Adrian] Following the
dreams and nightmares

937
00:55:41.323 --> 00:55:43.324
when I collapsed after the vertigo.

938
00:55:43.324 --> 00:55:45.586
vision disturbances and trembling.

939
00:55:45.586 --> 00:55:47.575
I assumed that it was due to exhausted

940
00:55:47.575 --> 00:55:50.426
or the stuff I had drunk
or something of the sort.

941
00:55:50.426 --> 00:55:52.636
Later that day. I went to visit Bud

942
00:55:52.636 --> 00:55:55.636
to give him my thoughts
on his special sand.

943
00:55:55.636 --> 00:56:00.026
- Adrian. how did that
little drink concoction

944
00:56:00.026 --> 00:56:02.356
that I recommend you make?

945
00:56:02.356 --> 00:56:03.524
- Bud. I gotta tell you.

946
00:56:03.524 --> 00:56:05.185
I had some good dreams
on it like you said.

947
00:56:05.185 --> 00:56:06.823
- Good.
- But I had some really

948
00:56:06.823 --> 00:56:09.153
terrible dreams too. I had nightmares.

949
00:56:09.153 --> 00:56:10.900
I mean. it started out good.

950
00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:13.335
I dreamt of my grandma
who's been dead for years.

951
00:56:13.335 --> 00:56:15.386
And then. I saw myself in there too.

952
00:56:15.386 --> 00:56:18.574
but it looked like my
nephew. Cameron. not like me.

953
00:56:18.574 --> 00:56:21.023
I mean. a barber shop
quartet tried to attack me.

954
00:56:21.023 --> 00:56:23.175
and they just. they were singing at me.

955
00:56:23.175 --> 00:56:24.008
It was really weird.

956
00:56:24.008 --> 00:56:26.400
I had a theremin player
try to creep me out playing

957
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.222
this theremin instrument
and all this other stuff.

958
00:56:29.222 --> 00:56:30.849
And he's made up my head.

959
00:56:30.849 --> 00:56:32.650
He's not even real.

960
00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:35.923
A girl in a black outfit tries
to shoot me with crossbow.

961
00:56:35.923 --> 00:56:37.431
and it just kept going on...

962
00:56:37.431 --> 00:56:40.832
My ex-wife. I ran into
Monette on the streets of LA.

963
00:56:40.832 --> 00:56:42.531
Haven't been to LA in years.

964
00:56:42.531 --> 00:56:45.222
She has her boyfriend with
her. a new guy named Brody.

965
00:56:45.222 --> 00:56:46.782
Some young guy in a fireman outfit.

966
00:56:46.782 --> 00:56:49.590
Why is he wearing fireman outfit
in my dream? I don't know.

967
00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:52.382
And then. to end it all.
I dream about my parents

968
00:56:52.382 --> 00:56:54.382
with this angel trying to
tell me how to live my life.

969
00:56:54.382 --> 00:56:55.472
- Adrian.
- Is it-

970
00:56:55.472 --> 00:56:56.305
- Stop.

971
00:56:58.203 --> 00:57:00.272
Don't take anymore.

972
00:57:00.272 --> 00:57:01.105
No. I'm serious.

973
00:57:01.105 --> 00:57:03.211
I think you oughta lay off.

974
00:57:03.211 --> 00:57:04.044
Please.

975
00:57:05.369 --> 00:57:06.202
Please. no more.

976
00:57:06.202 --> 00:57:08.285
Just. just lay off of it.

977
00:57:09.734 --> 00:57:12.631
- You don't have to tell me twice.

978
00:57:12.631 --> 00:57:14.694
But I had dreams about you too.

979
00:57:14.694 --> 00:57:16.824
I had good. I mean. you can
be the nicest guy in a dream.

980
00:57:16.824 --> 00:57:19.563
or you can be the most
terrifying guy in a dream.

981
00:57:19.563 --> 00:57:20.963
I don't wanna dream
about either one of you.

982
00:57:20.963 --> 00:57:23.504
(Bud chuckling)

983
00:57:23.504 --> 00:57:26.832
- That's what my wife used to say.

984
00:57:26.832 --> 00:57:28.332
God rest her soul.

985
00:57:30.032 --> 00:57:32.214
- So. you said you had
good dreams on this stuff.

986
00:57:32.214 --> 00:57:34.414
but did you actually have
nightmares like I did?

987
00:57:34.414 --> 00:57:35.331
Bad dreams?

988
00:57:37.302 --> 00:57:38.654
(Bud sighs)

989
00:57:38.654 --> 00:57:41.487
- Adrian. there were a great ones.

990
00:57:42.603 --> 00:57:47.520
But I have got to tell you that
I have tasted my own death.

991
00:57:48.843 --> 00:57:49.676
Death.

992
00:57:50.632 --> 00:57:51.799
For years now.

993
00:57:57.532 --> 00:57:59.243
Don't take anymore.

994
00:57:59.243 --> 00:58:01.993
(birds chirping)

995
00:58:04.192 --> 00:58:06.064
- [Adrian] Three days
later. I was proven wrong

996
00:58:06.064 --> 00:58:09.374
in my assumption about the
reason for my collapse.

997
00:58:09.374 --> 00:58:11.694
I was easily and swiftly diagnosed

998
00:58:11.694 --> 00:58:15.027
with this disruptive evil called cancer.

999
00:58:21.352 --> 00:58:24.254
(shoes thudding)
- Mom.

1000
00:58:24.254 --> 00:58:25.534
- Hey. honey.

1001
00:58:25.534 --> 00:58:26.894
- Are you going to bed?

1002
00:58:26.894 --> 00:58:29.003
- Not quite yet. but
you should get to bed.

1003
00:58:29.003 --> 00:58:30.824
It's getting pretty late.

1004
00:58:30.824 --> 00:58:31.657
Okay?

1005
00:58:33.403 --> 00:58:34.984
Good night.

1006
00:58:34.984 --> 00:58:36.151
- Okay.
- Okay.

1007
00:58:38.264 --> 00:58:39.814
- [Adrian] I had come to rely on advice

1008
00:58:39.814 --> 00:58:43.510
and many friendly visits
with Bud. but he went away.

1009
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:46.392
That is to say that he disappeared
once my treatment began

1010
00:58:46.392 --> 00:58:48.014
and the medications had grounded

1011
00:58:48.014 --> 00:58:50.723
and dulled my perception
of my environment.

1012
00:58:50.723 --> 00:58:55.242
He was real for 74 years. but
I couldn't see him anymore.

1013
00:58:55.242 --> 00:58:58.243
Just as probably no one else could since.

1014
00:58:58.243 --> 00:59:00.824
He didn't move away with possessions.

1015
00:59:00.824 --> 00:59:02.973
You see. he was a spirit.

1016
00:59:02.973 --> 00:59:06.403
A ghost living in our
modern material world.

1017
00:59:06.403 --> 00:59:08.123
I have a printed file photocopy

1018
00:59:08.123 --> 00:59:10.063
to support my knowing of him.

1019
00:59:10.063 --> 00:59:12.144
I hastily emptied the pouch of sand powder

1020
00:59:12.144 --> 00:59:14.392
in the sink the morning after the dreams

1021
00:59:14.392 --> 00:59:17.694
and cleansed the suede
of its former contents.

1022
00:59:17.694 --> 00:59:19.854
I'll never know what was really in it.

1023
00:59:19.854 --> 00:59:21.454
I haven't seen him nor anyone else

1024
00:59:21.454 --> 00:59:23.734
at Bud's house for more than a year now.

1025
00:59:23.734 --> 00:59:24.567
Bud?

1026
00:59:25.832 --> 00:59:26.665
- Oh yeah.

1027
00:59:29.163 --> 00:59:34.080
I think that you really have
to look for the girl. Shannon.

1028
00:59:35.544 --> 00:59:37.813
- I can't go there.

1029
00:59:37.813 --> 00:59:40.480
- You have to go there sometime.

1030
00:59:44.152 --> 00:59:44.985
Trust me.

1031
00:59:49.864 --> 00:59:51.464
- [Adrian] Shannon was real.

1032
00:59:51.464 --> 00:59:53.704
The mysterious lady. as my sisters Paige

1033
00:59:53.704 --> 00:59:55.803
and Clara liked to call her.

1034
00:59:55.803 --> 00:59:58.304
The dancer. the halcyon of my life

1035
00:59:58.304 --> 01:00:00.504
for the better part of a year.

1036
01:00:00.504 --> 01:00:02.523
I thought I saw her in my dream as a child

1037
01:00:02.523 --> 01:00:06.132
with my dear grandmother.
but I could've been mistaken.

1038
01:00:06.132 --> 01:00:09.944
She was also the victim of
tragedy at the tip of my hand.

1039
01:00:09.944 --> 01:00:11.352
We met 10 years ago in Boise.

1040
01:00:11.352 --> 01:00:13.011
but during out time
together while I was on

1041
01:00:13.011 --> 01:00:17.483
a year-long retreat. we traveled
the country incessantly.

1042
01:00:17.483 --> 01:00:20.152
After her fall. there
was no need for my family

1043
01:00:20.152 --> 01:00:23.831
to learn of what was ours and ours only.

1044
01:00:23.831 --> 01:00:26.013
What would that do for anyone?

1045
01:00:26.013 --> 01:00:29.024
I knew where Shannon was at
the whole time in those dreams.

1046
01:00:29.024 --> 01:00:30.023
I just couldn't bear the thought

1047
01:00:30.023 --> 01:00:31.984
of being with her in that way.

1048
01:00:31.984 --> 01:00:35.152
But now. it's inevitable and destined.

1049
01:00:35.152 --> 01:00:36.883
Bud told me that I would see Shannon again

1050
01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:40.523
if I wait for the opportunity
and let it happen.

1051
01:00:40.523 --> 01:00:41.744
Here we are.

1052
01:00:41.744 --> 01:00:44.573
My urge is to forego my
family's longtime resting lawn

1053
01:00:44.573 --> 01:00:46.843
in Gorge County for a specified location

1054
01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:50.043
as listed in my advanced directive.

1055
01:00:50.043 --> 01:00:52.963
I know my precious family will understand.

1056
01:00:52.963 --> 01:00:54.423
In these past four hours.

1057
01:00:54.423 --> 01:00:57.432
I've written without
inhibition and without rest.

1058
01:00:57.432 --> 01:00:58.976
A record for me. as I usually write

1059
01:00:58.976 --> 01:01:02.352
from emotionally afar with
deliberation and facade.

1060
01:01:02.352 --> 01:01:05.212
No excessive use of adjectives
to fill in the pages

1061
01:01:05.212 --> 01:01:07.413
or to guide the reader to my lair.

1062
01:01:07.413 --> 01:01:10.904
Still. in this book. I
could say more in words.

1063
01:01:10.904 --> 01:01:12.533
but I have not much more left in my hand.

1064
01:01:12.533 --> 01:01:14.173
as everything seems to be coming

1065
01:01:14.173 --> 01:01:16.673
to a halt in this very moment.

1066
01:01:20.973 --> 01:01:22.845
Some believe that your after future

1067
01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:25.063
is what you believe it will be.

1068
01:01:25.063 --> 01:01:27.632
I've been believing in mine for some time.

1069
01:01:27.632 --> 01:01:29.144
and I am strangely looking forward

1070
01:01:29.144 --> 01:01:32.773
to being let in on the big secret.

1071
01:01:32.773 --> 01:01:34.744
Of course. as cliche as it sounds.

1072
01:01:34.744 --> 01:01:36.994
we all find out eventually.

1073
01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:40.093
Though the visions and
sounds in those dreams

1074
01:01:40.093 --> 01:01:43.744
and nightmares appeared
behind my closed eyes.

1075
01:01:43.744 --> 01:01:47.244
my mind was stuck. awake and real. mostly.

1076
01:01:48.853 --> 01:01:50.686
I was barely dreaming.

1077
01:01:52.411 --> 01:01:55.161
(ethereal music)

1078
01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:06.886
(letter rustling)

1079
01:02:44.113 --> 01:02:49.113
(Paige gasps)
(somber music)

1080
01:03:19.422 --> 01:03:22.089
(Paige sighing)

1081
01:03:42.164 --> 01:03:44.997
(paper crinkling)

1082
01:03:55.851 --> 01:03:58.434
(gentle music)

1083
01:04:28.424 --> 01:04:29.993
(door thudding)

1084
01:04:29.993 --> 01:04:31.253
- Hey. honey.

1085
01:04:31.253 --> 01:04:34.464
Do you know Mr. Volner's number?

1086
01:04:34.464 --> 01:04:35.524
- Whose number?

1087
01:04:35.524 --> 01:04:39.053
- It's Adrian's publisher over at Brain.

1088
01:04:39.053 --> 01:04:43.053
- I think I still have it in
the junk drawer in the kitchen.

1089
01:04:43.053 --> 01:04:44.555
Does he not know?

1090
01:04:44.555 --> 01:04:47.805
- Well. I don't know about that. but...

1091
01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:56.355
Looks like Adrian has
one more story to tell.

1092
01:04:56.355 --> 01:04:58.165
(Keith sighs)

1093
01:04:58.165 --> 01:05:00.748
(gentle music)

1094
01:05:12.144 --> 01:05:14.725
All right. Clara. I just got to Adrian's.

1095
01:05:14.725 --> 01:05:16.784
I'll see you there in about an hour. okay?

1096
01:05:16.784 --> 01:05:17.617
Bye.

1097
01:05:21.973 --> 01:05:25.056
(peacocks squawking)

1098
01:05:58.533 --> 01:06:00.323
Hey. there.
- Hi.

1099
01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:02.485
- Hi. my name is Paige.

1100
01:06:02.485 --> 01:06:04.884
My brother Adrian owned
the home next door.

1101
01:06:04.884 --> 01:06:06.634
- Oh. hi. I'm Marsha.

1102
01:06:06.634 --> 01:06:09.386
I'm so sorry about your brother.

1103
01:06:09.386 --> 01:06:11.906
- [Paige] Yeah. he'll be missed.

1104
01:06:11.906 --> 01:06:13.485
- Yeah. he will.

1105
01:06:13.485 --> 01:06:15.175
- Marsha. huh.

1106
01:06:15.175 --> 01:06:18.594
It's funny. he never mentioned a Marsha.

1107
01:06:18.594 --> 01:06:21.906
He did talk an awful lot about a Bud.

1108
01:06:21.906 --> 01:06:23.834
Does that sound familiar?

1109
01:06:23.834 --> 01:06:26.295
- Mm. no Bud. just me.

1110
01:06:26.295 --> 01:06:27.906
- Huh.

1111
01:06:27.906 --> 01:06:31.805
Do you know if a Bud's
ever lived here before?

1112
01:06:31.805 --> 01:06:33.925
- Um. well. I moved in a year ago.

1113
01:06:33.925 --> 01:06:38.425
And well. I understand it
sat empty for several years.

1114
01:06:39.765 --> 01:06:42.906
and I really don't know
who might've been here.

1115
01:06:42.906 --> 01:06:44.406
- No Bud. how odd.

1116
01:06:46.253 --> 01:06:48.212
Well. if you don't mind me asking.

1117
01:06:48.212 --> 01:06:52.103
have you ever noticed anything
strange happening here?

1118
01:06:52.103 --> 01:06:53.852
(Marsha laughing)

1119
01:06:53.852 --> 01:06:57.173
- Well. I've had some
pretty strange dreams.

1120
01:06:57.173 --> 01:06:58.590
Kinda fun really.

1121
01:07:00.275 --> 01:07:02.595
I joke around a lot that
I think there's something

1122
01:07:02.595 --> 01:07:06.762
in the water 'cause it's
got a very unusual taste.

1123
01:07:07.776 --> 01:07:10.526
But you know. I'm used to it now.

1124
01:07:14.205 --> 01:07:16.205
Why. is there a problem?

1125
01:07:18.994 --> 01:07:21.982
- Oh. I'm sorry. yeah. no problem.

1126
01:07:21.982 --> 01:07:23.315
It's just there's
something about your home

1127
01:07:23.315 --> 01:07:26.315
that just feels very familiar to me.

1128
01:07:26.315 --> 01:07:29.605
Maybe it reminds me of
something I saw on TV.

1129
01:07:29.605 --> 01:07:31.525
- Oh. yeah. that's probably it.

1130
01:07:31.525 --> 01:07:34.125
(light eerie music)

1131
01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:37.458
- Very good. thanks for talking with me.

1132
01:07:38.296 --> 01:07:39.629
Take care.
- Bye.

1133
01:07:41.155 --> 01:07:43.324
(peacocks squawking)

1134
01:07:43.324 --> 01:07:47.157

1135
01:08:23.835 --> 01:08:27.002
(skateboard rattling)

1136
01:08:29.384 --> 01:08:30.967
- [Adrian] Cameron.

1137
01:08:32.303 --> 01:08:33.136
Cameron.

1138
01:08:38.103 --> 01:08:40.187
- [Cameron] Uncle Adrian?

1139
01:08:47.383 --> 01:08:49.155
- [Adrian] Cameron.

1140
01:08:49.155 --> 01:08:52.444
- Uncle Adrian. are you down here?

1141
01:08:52.444 --> 01:08:55.194
(birds chirping)

1142
01:08:58.136 --> 01:08:59.219
Uncle Adrian?

1143
01:09:00.853 --> 01:09:01.937
Uncle Adrian?

1144
01:09:07.594 --> 01:09:12.428
I can't see you. Uncle Adrian.
but I can feel you're here.

1145
01:09:22.085 --> 01:09:24.416
You do remember this don't you?

- Can you smile?
