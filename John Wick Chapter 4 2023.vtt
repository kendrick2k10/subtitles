00:01:00.732 --> 00:01:04.171
"I am the way
into the city of woe.

4
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.740
"I am the way into eternal pain.

5
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.316
"I am the way
to go among the lost.

6
00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:21.921
"Before me. there were
no created things.

7
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:25.357
"But those that last forever.

8
00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:30.860
"As do I!

9
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.301
"Abandon all hope
you who are about to
enter here."

10
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:42.242
You are now in the presence

11
00:01:43.208 --> 00:01:45.707
of the motherfuckin' king!

12
00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:07.465
You ready. John?

13
00:02:13.873 --> 00:02:14.901
Yeah.

14
00:02:57.116 --> 00:02:58.582
Move! John Wick!

15
00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.432
Mr. Wick.

16
00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.337
To what do I
owe the pleasure?

17
00:04:31.075 --> 00:04:32.379
My ring.

18
00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:35.481
My freedom.

19
00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.153
Your ring is gone.

20
00:04:40.153 --> 00:04:41.949
like The Elder
before me.

21
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.191
And if you
came here thinking

22
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:47.290
you could end this
by killing me.

23
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.055
then you
are mistaken.

24
00:04:50.432 --> 00:04:51.992
My death will not
change the outcome

25
00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:54.995
any more than you can
change your nature.

26
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.469
None of us
can escape who we are.

27
00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.343
and no one
escapes The Table.

28
00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:05.576
And the only way John Wick

29
00:05:05.576 --> 00:05:09.383
will ever have freedom
or peace. now or ever.

30
00:05:10.446 --> 00:05:11.748
is in death.

31
00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:15.587
I know.

32
00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:22.022
I'm afraid you've come
a very long way

33
00:05:22.898 --> 00:05:23.925
for nothing.

34
00:05:26.163 --> 00:05:27.434
Yeah...

35
00:05:31.874 --> 00:05:33.099
Not really.

36
00:06:23.454 --> 00:06:25.822
The Manager. please.

37
00:06:35.163 --> 00:06:38.967
A Harbinger is here
to see you. sir.

38
00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:41.902
This must
be a mistake.

39
00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:43.769
There is no mistake.

40
00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:45.344
By order
of the Marquis.

41
00:06:45.344 --> 00:06:47.842
Vincent Bisset
de Gramont.

42
00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:49.912
this hotel
has been condemned.

43
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.992
You have one hour.

44
00:07:15.772 --> 00:07:17.203
He is
expecting you.

45
00:07:23.547 --> 00:07:24.980
Can they do this. sir?

46
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.214
The decree is signed
by the 12 members of The Table.

47
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:31.390
giving the Marquis

48
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.185
the power of <i>autem imperator.</i>

49
00:07:33.185 --> 00:07:38.026
which means he is
now our judge. jury and...

50
00:07:41.034 --> 00:07:42.767
Evacuate the hotel.

51
00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.356
Ned Kelly's final words
as the hangman slipped

52
00:08:03.356 --> 00:08:05.526
the noose
around his neck were...

53
00:08:06.754 --> 00:08:09.521
"Such is life."

54
00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:12.729
Can you imagine
the acceptance.
the defiance?

55
00:08:12.729 --> 00:08:15.536
Today is not the day
you will die.

56
00:08:16.337 --> 00:08:18.102
Of that.
I am sure.

57
00:08:18.102 --> 00:08:21.537
You have
the unshakeable faith
of David. my friend.

58
00:08:21.537 --> 00:08:23.610
but you shouldn't be here.

59
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:26.173
This will not be pleasant.

60
00:08:27.809 --> 00:08:29.781
Such is life. sir.

61
00:08:57.043 --> 00:08:59.745
My father used to say.

62
00:09:00.479 --> 00:09:02.579
"How you do anything

63
00:09:02.579 --> 00:09:05.719
"is how you do everything."

64
00:09:05.719 --> 00:09:09.051
Called it the first
and the last rule of life.

65
00:09:12.653 --> 00:09:14.320
You believe in rules...

66
00:09:17.726 --> 00:09:19.028
Mr. Manager?

67
00:09:21.135 --> 00:09:22.163
Oh. I do.

68
00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:25.804
And what
of consequences?

69
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.807
Of course.

70
00:09:30.905 --> 00:09:33.313
And second chances.

71
00:09:33.313 --> 00:09:37.149
Ah. That's where we differ.

72
00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:38.282
you and I.

73
00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:43.653
Second chances

74
00:09:43.653 --> 00:09:46.957
are the refuge of men who fail.

75
00:10:17.226 --> 00:10:18.659
Mm.

76
00:10:19.659 --> 00:10:22.091
There are those on The Table

77
00:10:22.891 --> 00:10:24.627
who blame this. um.

78
00:10:24.627 --> 00:10:27.228
atrocity on New York.

79
00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:30.836
They believe
it's this city.

80
00:10:33.101 --> 00:10:35.441
The Table has indulged this

81
00:10:35.441 --> 00:10:37.073
fucking place for too long.

82
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.142
And look where
that has gotten us.

83
00:10:43.878 --> 00:10:45.385
I shot him.

84
00:10:45.385 --> 00:10:47.754
And yet he lives.

85
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:50.416
polluting everything he touches.

86
00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:53.259
Marquis.
respectfully.
my hotel...

87
00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:54.893
Your hotel?

88
00:10:56.924 --> 00:10:59.832
If I might. sir?

89
00:11:07.737 --> 00:11:09.006
By all means.

90
00:11:12.011 --> 00:11:14.913
The Continentals
and their management

91
00:11:15.646 --> 00:11:17.683
are a reminder

92
00:11:17.683 --> 00:11:19.653
to all who sit
beneath The Table

93
00:11:19.653 --> 00:11:23.020
that none of us
are above the rules.

94
00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:27.222
And yet we are here.

95
00:11:27.922 --> 00:11:29.223
Sir. Mr. Wick...

96
00:11:29.223 --> 00:11:31.765
We're not here
because of John Wick!

97
00:11:36.202 --> 00:11:39.399
He is simply the face
of your failure. Mr. Manager.

98
00:11:44.478 --> 00:11:46.043
The sand in that glass

99
00:11:46.043 --> 00:11:50.245
is merely an echo
of my remaining patience.

100
00:12:20.109 --> 00:12:22.178
You are no longer New York.

101
00:12:25.515 --> 00:12:26.952
You are nothing.

102
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.418
You are Excommunicado.

103
00:12:33.526 --> 00:12:34.553
And as such...

104
00:12:37.429 --> 00:12:40.493
you no longer need
the services
of a concierge.

105
00:13:06.791 --> 00:13:09.423
It has been an honor.

106
00:13:10.562 --> 00:13:11.925
my friend.

107
00:13:21.773 --> 00:13:23.140
It should have been me.

108
00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.308
Yes.

109
00:13:27.513 --> 00:13:28.607
But it wasn't.

110
00:13:29.717 --> 00:13:31.449
Now. you think about
why that is.

111
00:13:31.449 --> 00:13:35.119
and perhaps one of us
will have benefited
from this conversation.

112
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.610
I have a name for you.

113
00:15:11.553 --> 00:15:12.953
Respectfully.

114
00:15:13.785 --> 00:15:15.054
I'm retired.

115
00:15:15.787 --> 00:15:17.188
Finished. Done.

116
00:15:18.856 --> 00:15:20.191
I disagree.

117
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.655
I'm no use to you.

118
00:15:24.565 --> 00:15:25.999
Or The Table.

119
00:15:25.999 --> 00:15:29.468
That's not
for you to decide.

120
00:15:35.371 --> 00:15:37.472
I think you should
find someone else.

121
00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:43.511
You came close.

122
00:15:44.979 --> 00:15:46.217
Today.

123
00:15:46.883 --> 00:15:48.247
Too close.

124
00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:50.188
You put her in danger.

125
00:16:03.132 --> 00:16:04.565
I know the deal I made.

126
00:16:16.444 --> 00:16:19.085
A former associate. I believe.

127
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.321
He was.

128
00:16:28.024 --> 00:16:29.260
And a friend.

129
00:16:32.433 --> 00:16:33.429
Hmm.

130
00:16:36.236 --> 00:16:39.105
The agreement
with The Table
stays the same.

131
00:16:40.235 --> 00:16:42.003
We give you a name.

132
00:16:42.003 --> 00:16:43.340
you give us a life.

133
00:16:43.808 --> 00:16:44.803
Or...

134
00:16:46.042 --> 00:16:47.278
we take one.

135
00:17:07.998 --> 00:17:09.465
I will serve.

136
00:17:10.366 --> 00:17:12.303
I will be
of service.

137
00:17:15.807 --> 00:17:17.242
Excellent!

138
00:17:21.878 --> 00:17:24.579
I assume you
have a notion of
where he might be?

139
00:17:28.083 --> 00:17:31.454
John Wick has
few friends remaining
in the world.

140
00:17:32.122 --> 00:17:34.259
and even fewer he trusts

141
00:17:35.058 --> 00:17:36.294
with his life.

142
00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:42.133
Very. very good.

143
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:35.283
Welcome to
the Osaka Continental.
How can I help?

144
00:18:35.283 --> 00:18:36.717
Yeah. I'm lookin'
for a room.

145
00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.328
I'm afraid this facility
doesn't allow animals.

146
00:18:45.129 --> 00:18:46.661
Emotional support animal.

147
00:18:46.661 --> 00:18:48.594
She's your
support animal?
Other way round.

148
00:18:48.594 --> 00:18:51.567
I'm hers.
Isn't that right?

149
00:18:57.075 --> 00:18:58.376
She stays in your room.

150
00:19:02.278 --> 00:19:03.612
Enjoy
your stay. sir.

151
00:19:13.256 --> 00:19:14.557
It's not too bad.

152
00:19:15.422 --> 00:19:16.994
Not bad at all.

153
00:19:31.511 --> 00:19:33.604
There is a dog
in my lobby.

154
00:19:33.604 --> 00:19:35.208
Emotional
support animal.

155
00:19:35.208 --> 00:19:37.281
Of course it is.

156
00:19:37.281 --> 00:19:39.781
Tomorrow's schedule.
Mr. Suzuki at 11:00

157
00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:42.381
and the Tarasovs
are requesting
an audience at 2:00.

158
00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:44.287
What's this at 8:00?

159
00:19:44.287 --> 00:19:45.586
Dinner with
your daughter.

160
00:19:45.586 --> 00:19:46.758
She says
she's concerned
you've been

161
00:19:46.758 --> 00:19:48.294
working too hard.

162
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.259
What must I have done
to deserve

163
00:19:51.259 --> 00:19:53.727
such a considerate child?

164
00:19:53.727 --> 00:19:57.066
Good karma.
I suppose. Indeed.

165
00:19:57.066 --> 00:19:59.669
And how are our guests?

166
00:19:59.669 --> 00:20:03.172
Some of
our gold club members
are anxious.

167
00:20:03.172 --> 00:20:05.209
It's always something.

168
00:20:05.209 --> 00:20:07.175
And today
it's New York.

169
00:20:07.175 --> 00:20:08.681
And my concierge?

170
00:20:08.681 --> 00:20:10.683
Concerned.

171
00:20:10.683 --> 00:20:14.254
Perhaps we should
get you an emotional
support animal.

172
00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:23.091
We've done nothing
to offend The Table.

173
00:20:23.091 --> 00:20:24.989
Your relationship with Mr. Wick
is no secret.

174
00:20:24.989 --> 00:20:28.027
The Table will come.

175
00:20:28.027 --> 00:20:29.995
And...

176
00:20:31.238 --> 00:20:34.006
...will be met
with our grace.

177
00:20:34.006 --> 00:20:35.638
Everything he touches dies.

178
00:20:45.117 --> 00:20:46.517
Forgive me. Father.

179
00:20:51.121 --> 00:20:52.325
Akira.

180
00:20:55.559 --> 00:20:57.327
Please tell my daughter

181
00:20:57.327 --> 00:20:59.365
that I look forward
to our dinner.

182
00:22:03.593 --> 00:22:05.464
Apparently not.

183
00:22:06.732 --> 00:22:09.501
Killing the Elder
was a mistake. my friend.

184
00:22:12.666 --> 00:22:17.003
Their response
was the destruction of
the New York Continental.

185
00:22:18.807 --> 00:22:20.974
My daughter fears
we are next.

186
00:22:22.277 --> 00:22:23.546
Winston?

187
00:22:23.546 --> 00:22:27.145
Alive. but they executed
his concierge

188
00:22:28.286 --> 00:22:29.917
to prove a point.

189
00:22:42.369 --> 00:22:44.437
Have you given
any thought to

190
00:22:44.972 --> 00:22:46.505
where this ends?

191
00:22:51.838 --> 00:22:53.875
The Table
will never stop.

192
00:22:55.917 --> 00:22:56.911
You know this.

193
00:23:01.055 --> 00:23:02.818
It only takes life

194
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.788
and only gives death.

195
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.059
Koji...

196
00:23:22.972 --> 00:23:26.171
Friendship means little
when it's convenient.

197
00:24:16.831 --> 00:24:18.997
Welcome to
the Osaka Continental.
How can I help?

198
00:24:18.997 --> 00:24:20.159
The manager.

199
00:24:22.729 --> 00:24:23.965
<i>Por favor.</i>

200
00:24:27.205 --> 00:24:29.133
Of course.

201
00:24:29.133 --> 00:24:30.840
Please. make
yourself comfortable.

202
00:24:41.422 --> 00:24:44.623
The only path
this leads to is death.

203
00:24:47.889 --> 00:24:50.123
I'm going
to kill them all.

204
00:24:50.123 --> 00:24:52.994
I believe you'll try.

205
00:24:53.529 --> 00:24:55.027
But no one.

206
00:24:55.027 --> 00:24:57.834
not even you.
can kill everyone.

207
00:25:00.602 --> 00:25:01.838
You want to die?

208
00:25:02.704 --> 00:25:04.005
That's your choice.

209
00:25:05.574 --> 00:25:06.777
A good death

210
00:25:07.777 --> 00:25:10.143
only comes after a good life.

211
00:25:11.649 --> 00:25:13.647
You and I left
a good life behind

212
00:25:13.647 --> 00:25:15.951
a long time ago. my friend.

213
00:25:21.162 --> 00:25:22.925
Father. The High Table.

214
00:25:24.693 --> 00:25:26.023
What is he doing here?

215
00:25:26.023 --> 00:25:28.161
Mr. Wick
is our guest.

216
00:25:29.168 --> 00:25:30.561
Father...

217
00:25:30.561 --> 00:25:32.999
I'll talk to them.
They don't know
you're here.

218
00:25:32.999 --> 00:25:35.806
Stay with Mr. Wick.

219
00:25:48.387 --> 00:25:49.589
<i>Hai.</i>

220
00:26:15.182 --> 00:26:18.145
Welcome
to the Osaka Continental. gentlemen.

221
00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:22.081
How may I be
of service?

222
00:26:22.081 --> 00:26:23.786
The Table has
reason to believe

223
00:26:23.786 --> 00:26:27.158
that this facility
is providing services...

224
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.732
That is
a grave accusation.

225
00:26:34.732 --> 00:26:37.637
We will require
full access
to your hotel.

226
00:26:39.238 --> 00:26:40.701
Of course.

227
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:42.404
But as you
are well aware.

228
00:26:42.404 --> 00:26:44.235
no business.

229
00:26:44.235 --> 00:26:45.940
not even your kind
of business.

230
00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.548
may be conducted
on Continental grounds.

231
00:26:49.548 --> 00:26:52.076
So. I'm going
to have to ask you

232
00:26:52.076 --> 00:26:54.687
to surrender your firearms.

233
00:26:56.455 --> 00:26:58.555
We speak for the Marquis.

234
00:26:58.555 --> 00:27:00.693
And I speak
for Osaka.

235
00:27:01.293 --> 00:27:02.321
Your guns.

236
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.125
please.

237
00:27:06.031 --> 00:27:09.898
Don't repeat the mistake
that fool in New York made.

238
00:27:09.898 --> 00:27:12.930
Fools talk.
cowards are silent.

239
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.739
but wise men listen.

240
00:27:15.739 --> 00:27:17.710
So which one
will you be?

241
00:27:28.256 --> 00:27:30.448
Hello. old friend.

242
00:27:33.187 --> 00:27:37.059
So good of you to visit
after all these years.

243
00:27:38.094 --> 00:27:40.326
You are
with them now?
No.

244
00:27:42.865 --> 00:27:44.935
No.
Your daughter?

245
00:27:45.699 --> 00:27:46.937
Mia?

246
00:27:48.538 --> 00:27:49.742
Alive.

247
00:27:51.411 --> 00:27:52.811
And your daughter Akira?

248
00:27:54.742 --> 00:27:55.946
Well.

249
00:27:57.679 --> 00:27:58.883
I'm glad.

250
00:28:01.486 --> 00:28:02.722
You know...

251
00:28:04.691 --> 00:28:06.825
we don't have
to end this with blood.

252
00:28:08.691 --> 00:28:10.460
Then leave.

253
00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.928
No one defies The Table.

254
00:28:11.928 --> 00:28:14.531
I remember once
you understood that.

255
00:28:14.531 --> 00:28:16.099
And I remember a time

256
00:28:16.099 --> 00:28:19.004
when you understood
the meaning of brotherhood.

257
00:28:19.004 --> 00:28:20.671
Enough!

258
00:28:20.671 --> 00:28:22.674
By order of
the Marquis de Gramont.

259
00:28:22.674 --> 00:28:25.173
this hotel has
been deconsecrated.

260
00:28:26.214 --> 00:28:27.439
Step aside.

261
00:28:43.529 --> 00:28:44.962
Don't do this. Koji.

262
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:56.072
I'm sorry.

263
00:30:15.555 --> 00:30:16.614
Get out.

264
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.743
Secure the hotel.

265
00:30:42.743 --> 00:30:44.081
Find Wick.

266
00:30:52.288 --> 00:30:53.550
If they find you here.

267
00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:56.522
The Table will
kill my father. me.

268
00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:00.130
everyone. because
you broke the rules.

269
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.133
You shouldn't have come.

270
00:31:27.625 --> 00:31:28.620
You armed?

271
00:32:39.361 --> 00:32:40.593
<i>Hai.</i>

272
00:33:35.015 --> 00:33:36.687
Hey!

273
00:33:36.687 --> 00:33:38.284
Blind man!

274
00:33:38.284 --> 00:33:40.356
Do your job!

275
00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.775
Akira!

276
00:38:13.462 --> 00:38:14.826
Get out the way
you came.

277
00:38:14.826 --> 00:38:17.299
Go to
the Umeda Station.
I'll stay.

278
00:38:17.299 --> 00:38:19.833
Don't insult
my gift to you.

279
00:38:22.572 --> 00:38:25.575
And. John. do me
a small courtesy.

280
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.228
John?

281
00:43:50.598 --> 00:43:51.802
Caine.

282
00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:02.780
They gave you
my name.

283
00:44:06.218 --> 00:44:07.279
Yeah.

284
00:44:10.552 --> 00:44:11.921
I'm sorry.

285
00:44:14.258 --> 00:44:15.287
Me. too.

286
00:44:37.112 --> 00:44:38.981
You should have
stayed out.

287
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.380
For all our sakes.

288
00:44:43.489 --> 00:44:45.317
I tried.

289
00:44:47.291 --> 00:44:48.386
Did you?

290
00:45:22.922 --> 00:45:24.257
Come on. John.

291
00:45:27.028 --> 00:45:28.397
Let's get this shit
over with.

292
00:45:32.404 --> 00:45:33.937
Yeah.

293
00:45:33.937 --> 00:45:36.236
That sounds
like a good idea.

294
00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.320
You took a deal.

295
00:45:56.594 --> 00:45:57.994
Same as you. John.

296
00:46:01.695 --> 00:46:02.900
Family?

297
00:46:06.565 --> 00:46:07.799
Family.

298
00:46:36.963 --> 00:46:38.430
You dead. John?

299
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:17.007
John.

300
00:47:17.706 --> 00:47:19.075
Caine.

301
00:47:57.177 --> 00:48:01.181
John Wick. open...

302
00:48:01.181 --> 00:48:05.582
John Wick...

303
00:49:10.883 --> 00:49:12.749
Damn. Johnny.

304
00:49:12.749 --> 00:49:15.257
This is
quite the mess
you've made.

305
00:49:15.858 --> 00:49:17.626
I don't know you.

306
00:49:17.626 --> 00:49:18.759
But I know you.

307
00:49:26.605 --> 00:49:28.171
You a tracker?

308
00:49:33.809 --> 00:49:35.079
How much?

309
00:49:38.243 --> 00:49:39.611
Not enough.

310
00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:43.582
But it's gettin' there.

311
00:49:49.594 --> 00:49:52.030
I need you
to take better care
of yourself. Johnny.

312
00:49:54.297 --> 00:49:56.232
'Cause we're
in this together now.

313
00:50:40.776 --> 00:50:42.245
All right. Koji.

314
00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:49.384
Just tell me where John is
and get out of here.

315
00:50:50.787 --> 00:50:51.848
Leave.

316
00:50:52.956 --> 00:50:55.522
Go somewhere far away.

317
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:58.822
You know I won't.

318
00:51:28.121 --> 00:51:29.886
You owe John Wick nothing.

319
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:35.265
He has no marker on you.

320
00:51:41.306 --> 00:51:44.368
You must
have fallen far
to believe

321
00:51:44.368 --> 00:51:46.369
the only debts we have...

322
00:51:47.975 --> 00:51:49.840
...lie in markers.

323
00:51:56.489 --> 00:51:57.584
Come on.

324
00:52:00.023 --> 00:52:01.654
I don't want to do this.

325
00:52:47.867 --> 00:52:49.207
Father!

326
00:53:04.856 --> 00:53:05.949
Look at me.

327
00:53:14.298 --> 00:53:16.696
Even a blind man knows
you have lost.

328
00:53:18.936 --> 00:53:20.370
And. Caine.

329
00:53:21.935 --> 00:53:25.639
you don't need eyes
to see the right path.

330
00:53:29.314 --> 00:53:30.974
Just take care
of your daughter.

331
00:53:33.344 --> 00:53:34.681
I...

332
00:53:37.753 --> 00:53:38.850
I am.

333
00:53:45.522 --> 00:53:47.463
No!

334
00:54:24.397 --> 00:54:25.732
Don't.

335
00:54:28.301 --> 00:54:29.505
Live.

336
00:54:51.557 --> 00:54:53.331
I'll be waiting for you.

337
00:56:06.036 --> 00:56:07.163
Who is he?

338
00:56:14.243 --> 00:56:15.908
He was a friend.

339
00:56:17.878 --> 00:56:20.176
My father is dead
because of you.

340
00:56:23.583 --> 00:56:25.115
Because of what you did.

341
00:56:28.753 --> 00:56:30.956
So either you kill him...

342
00:56:33.129 --> 00:56:34.465
or I will.

343
00:56:41.567 --> 00:56:43.441
I understand.

344
00:57:03.556 --> 00:57:06.893
Goodbye. Mr. Wick.

345
00:57:30.055 --> 00:57:31.214
Thanks for coming.

346
00:57:32.722 --> 00:57:34.424
Well. us homeless folk
do have to

347
00:57:34.424 --> 00:57:36.494
stick together now.
don't we?

348
00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:43.567
I need to speak
to him.

349
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:47.898
Last time
you spoke to him.

350
00:57:47.898 --> 00:57:50.908
you shot him
off a roof.

351
00:57:50.908 --> 00:57:52.870
I had no choice.

352
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:54.743
They held
all the cards.

353
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:56.514
No.

354
00:57:57.314 --> 00:57:59.048
But who held the gun?

355
00:57:59.048 --> 00:58:01.680
John needs to know
the breadth of what's
coming at him.

356
00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.520
This Marquis
is unrestrained.

357
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.484
The Table have
let him off the leash.

358
00:58:05.484 --> 00:58:07.719
Oh. my dear Winston.

359
00:58:07.719 --> 00:58:10.660
your benevolence
is touching!

360
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:14.463
But tell me.
Tell me true.

361
00:58:14.463 --> 00:58:17.162
Why did the Frenchman
let you live?

362
00:58:17.162 --> 00:58:20.131
Killing a man
can turn him
into a martyr.

363
00:58:21.272 --> 00:58:23.871
Letting him live...

364
00:58:23.871 --> 00:58:27.204
tells the world
he's a coward
or a turncoat.

365
00:58:30.775 --> 00:58:32.583
So what are you?

366
00:58:34.547 --> 00:58:36.081
Aggrieved.

367
00:58:57.839 --> 00:59:01.238
I fail to see
how laying waste
to Continentals

368
00:59:01.238 --> 00:59:04.748
is getting you closer
to killing John Wick.

369
00:59:04.748 --> 00:59:08.045
This campaign
is not to kill John Wick.

370
00:59:08.045 --> 00:59:10.984
It is to kill
the idea
of John Wick.

371
00:59:11.883 --> 00:59:13.819
And to do that.
I must

372
00:59:13.819 --> 00:59:16.693
destroy everything
that idea touches.

373
00:59:21.763 --> 00:59:23.694
The bloodshed
in Osaka

374
00:59:23.694 --> 00:59:25.229
was not necessary.

375
00:59:26.802 --> 00:59:29.871
The bloodshed
was the point.

376
00:59:45.687 --> 00:59:47.625
He'll make it
your choice.

377
00:59:55.399 --> 00:59:57.261
You. come with me.

378
00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.034
Think twice
before accepting.

379
01:00:07.608 --> 01:00:08.811
And you are?

380
01:00:09.577 --> 01:00:10.813
Nobody.

381
01:00:12.844 --> 01:00:16.582
Coyness. Mr. Nobody.

382
01:00:16.582 --> 01:00:18.282
is a pathetic trait.

383
01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.250
A miscalculation.

384
01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:24.658
in which by trying
to hide our ego.

385
01:00:24.658 --> 01:00:26.697
we let it appear
stark naked.

386
01:00:29.567 --> 01:00:31.361
I will ask
only once.

387
01:00:36.607 --> 01:00:38.808
How were you able
to locate him?

388
01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:42.372
Pay
and I'll tell you.

389
01:00:48.447 --> 01:00:51.520
How much would
such a service
be worth?

390
01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.985
Twenty-five
million.

391
01:00:52.985 --> 01:00:55.851
plus a matching contribution
to my 401k

392
01:00:55.851 --> 01:00:57.125
when he's dead.

393
01:00:57.125 --> 01:00:58.289
Hmm.

394
01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.530
We found him once.

395
01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:03.595
We'll find him again.

396
01:01:03.595 --> 01:01:04.931
Is that before

397
01:01:04.931 --> 01:01:07.100
or after he puts you
in the ground?

398
01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:15.240
I like you.

399
01:01:18.877 --> 01:01:20.344
Twenty million.

400
01:01:24.422 --> 01:01:25.822
Like me some more.

401
01:01:27.226 --> 01:01:28.319
Twenty-three.

402
01:01:29.395 --> 01:01:32.589
Ego. Mr. Nobody. Mm.

403
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:34.696
It's 23.

404
01:01:34.696 --> 01:01:36.459
You clearly
can afford it.

405
01:01:44.674 --> 01:01:46.370
For the service.
Mm-hmm.

406
01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:51.507
Fuck!

407
01:01:53.781 --> 01:01:55.451
No. no. no.
No. It's okay.

408
01:01:55.451 --> 01:01:57.553
Hey. it's okay.
Sit. Sit.

409
01:02:00.886 --> 01:02:02.852
What the fuck
is this. man?

410
01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:05.122
A choice.

411
01:02:05.122 --> 01:02:06.695
You can pull
the knife out

412
01:02:06.695 --> 01:02:09.866
or you can pull
your hand out.

413
01:02:09.866 --> 01:02:12.796
One shows me
a man committed
only to himself.

414
01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:14.196
and the other.

415
01:02:14.196 --> 01:02:16.532
a man committed
to the cause.

416
01:02:17.706 --> 01:02:18.974
Which one are you?

417
01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:55.202
Winston.

418
01:03:55.868 --> 01:03:57.237
Jonathan.

419
01:03:58.971 --> 01:04:00.911
My condolences.

420
01:04:02.173 --> 01:04:03.947
He was a good man.

421
01:04:05.912 --> 01:04:07.379
Yes. he was.

422
01:04:08.146 --> 01:04:10.085
Taken for our sins.

423
01:04:20.091 --> 01:04:21.558
Who is this?

424
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:25.232
The Marquis de Gramont.

425
01:04:25.232 --> 01:04:28.931
Elevated only by
his guarantee
of killing you.

426
01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:32.404
All the resources
of The Table
are at his disposal.

427
01:04:33.875 --> 01:04:35.473
Where do I find him?

428
01:04:36.546 --> 01:04:37.574
Paris.

429
01:04:42.586 --> 01:04:43.954
Where will it end?

430
01:04:45.521 --> 01:04:46.517
Huh?

431
01:04:47.954 --> 01:04:49.355
With him dead.

432
01:04:50.187 --> 01:04:52.193
Oh. And then?

433
01:04:53.759 --> 01:04:55.092
Hmm?

434
01:04:55.092 --> 01:04:59.397
Have you
learned nothing?

435
01:04:59.397 --> 01:05:02.901
They will replace him
before the body's cold.

436
01:05:02.901 --> 01:05:04.734
Hercules had his Hydra.

437
01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:07.204
You have The Table.
except you'll
run out of bullets

438
01:05:07.204 --> 01:05:09.276
before they
run out of heads.

439
01:05:13.512 --> 01:05:17.051
Kill him. but do it
the smart way.

440
01:05:17.051 --> 01:05:19.187
And get him to give you
your freedom.

441
01:05:21.755 --> 01:05:23.223
How?

442
01:05:23.223 --> 01:05:25.862
Turn his rules
and consequences
against him.

443
01:05:25.862 --> 01:05:28.394
Challenge him
to single combat.

444
01:05:30.065 --> 01:05:33.336
High Table duels are a myth.

445
01:05:33.336 --> 01:05:34.771
Wrong!

446
01:05:34.771 --> 01:05:37.566
They're a cold
hard fact.

447
01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:39.802
and part of the foundation
of The Table

448
01:05:39.802 --> 01:05:43.409
to stop its more
combustible members
from outright war.

449
01:05:45.782 --> 01:05:48.183
It's also.
win or lose.

450
01:05:50.314 --> 01:05:52.220
what you say you want.

451
01:05:52.886 --> 01:05:54.420
a way out.

452
01:05:58.389 --> 01:06:00.794
I don't sit at The Table.

453
01:06:00.794 --> 01:06:03.196
Your family does.

454
01:06:03.196 --> 01:06:04.999
Get them to issue
the challenge

455
01:06:04.999 --> 01:06:07.571
and then offer you up
as proxy.

456
01:06:07.571 --> 01:06:09.905
I don't have a family.

457
01:06:09.905 --> 01:06:12.471
The Ruska Roma
tore my ticket.

458
01:06:14.145 --> 01:06:18.081
Then I suggest
you get your ass
to Berlin

459
01:06:18.848 --> 01:06:20.281
and get it mended.

460
01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.184
Or...

461
01:06:24.688 --> 01:06:25.715
pick a plot.

462
01:06:28.324 --> 01:06:30.720
What do you get
out of this. Winston?

463
01:06:32.097 --> 01:06:34.361
What you were so good
at getting. Jonathan.

464
01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:37.162
Revenge.

465
01:07:30.018 --> 01:07:32.419
Hmm.

466
01:08:16.132 --> 01:08:17.563
Nice suit.

467
01:08:33.949 --> 01:08:35.513
Speak.

468
01:08:35.513 --> 01:08:38.419
He's in Berlin.
at the Ruska Roma.

469
01:08:38.419 --> 01:08:40.819
<i>You can wire
that finder's fee now.</i>

470
01:08:40.819 --> 01:08:41.884
No.

471
01:08:42.694 --> 01:08:44.193
<i>Excuse me?</i>

472
01:08:44.193 --> 01:08:46.691
Kill John and you'll
get your money.

473
01:08:48.196 --> 01:08:49.925
That wasn't part of our deal.

474
01:08:51.366 --> 01:08:54.799
The deal was
for your service.

475
01:08:54.799 --> 01:08:58.472
And it's now
a life for a life.
Mr. Nobody.

476
01:09:00.273 --> 01:09:03.807
<i>Yours or his.</i>

477
01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:07.376
When it's done.
you will have your prize.

478
01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:08.812
And your pension.

479
01:09:18.123 --> 01:09:19.361
Asshole.

480
01:09:51.158 --> 01:09:52.592
Jonathan Wick?

481
01:10:10.012 --> 01:10:11.442
You are forgetting

482
01:10:11.442 --> 01:10:14.446
we are still
under The Table.

483
01:10:14.446 --> 01:10:17.149
And last I checked...

484
01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:19.350
...you are Excommunicado

485
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:22.556
and your ticket
was torn.

486
01:10:23.788 --> 01:10:27.297
You have no business
with us.

487
01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:31.763
Pyotr is dead!

488
01:10:36.675 --> 01:10:38.305
After you

489
01:10:38.305 --> 01:10:40.508
put a bullet
in The Elder's head.

490
01:10:42.347 --> 01:10:44.842
the Marquis had one
put in Pyotr's.

491
01:10:45.943 --> 01:10:49.350
And in fine
Russian tradition...

492
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:52.047
He sent us the bill.

493
01:10:53.792 --> 01:10:55.351
Because of you.

494
01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:56.820
I had to kneel

495
01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:59.755
in front of the man
who murdered my father.

496
01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:01.995
Then we have

497
01:11:01.995 --> 01:11:03.663
a common enemy.

498
01:11:05.035 --> 01:11:07.932
We can help each other.

499
01:11:07.932 --> 01:11:12.134
You can't even
help yourself.

500
01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:14.569
How the hell
are you going
to help us?

501
01:11:14.569 --> 01:11:18.475
By killing this Marquis.

502
01:11:18.475 --> 01:11:20.376
They just
appoint another.

503
01:11:24.889 --> 01:11:26.482
It does

504
01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:29.491
if I kill him in a duel!

505
01:12:10.499 --> 01:12:12.395
How many did you kill

506
01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:13.562
to get out?

507
01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:15.702
A lot.

508
01:12:16.802 --> 01:12:18.837
You will only have
to kill one

509
01:12:19.405 --> 01:12:20.706
to get back in.

510
01:12:20.706 --> 01:12:23.809
The bastard who
murdered my father.

511
01:12:25.412 --> 01:12:27.978
Give me the name.

512
01:12:29.184 --> 01:12:30.880
Killa Harkan.

513
01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.487
You will find him
at Himmel and Hölle.

514
01:12:33.487 --> 01:12:36.324
When he's dead.
I will mend your ticket.

515
01:12:36.324 --> 01:12:38.654
And the Crest?

516
01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:41.563
Harkan first. then we talk.

517
01:12:42.231 --> 01:12:43.930
Bring proof of death.

518
01:12:47.038 --> 01:12:48.867
I'll need a way in.

519
01:12:51.473 --> 01:12:53.069
I know a way.

520
01:12:54.209 --> 01:12:55.511
Klaus will take you.

521
01:13:04.823 --> 01:13:06.115
I am Klaus.

522
01:13:10.788 --> 01:13:12.856
John.
I am Klaus.

523
01:14:01.608 --> 01:14:02.873
Please tell your mistress

524
01:14:02.873 --> 01:14:04.845
that I am honored
by this gesture

525
01:14:04.845 --> 01:14:07.847
and I look forward to
our continuing partnership.

526
01:14:09.251 --> 01:14:10.553
I am Klaus.

527
01:14:17.523 --> 01:14:20.057
Mr. John Wick

528
01:14:20.658 --> 01:14:22.129
in the flesh.

529
01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:26.965
The Baba Yaga.

530
01:14:28.206 --> 01:14:29.497
Must be Christmas. <i>ja?</i>

531
01:14:40.812 --> 01:14:42.717
Where are
my manners? Please.

532
01:14:48.654 --> 01:14:50.791
A drink. Mr. Wick?

533
01:14:53.991 --> 01:14:55.996
You were
expecting me.

534
01:14:55.996 --> 01:14:57.160
Not me.

535
01:14:58.331 --> 01:14:59.536
Him.

536
01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:01.399
John?

537
01:15:04.108 --> 01:15:05.102
How are you?

538
01:15:07.145 --> 01:15:09.077
You knew I'd be here.

539
01:15:09.077 --> 01:15:10.844
I suspected it.

540
01:15:11.542 --> 01:15:12.780
Family.

541
01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:20.722
That family
sold you out. Mr. Wick.

542
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:23.724
They gave you up

543
01:15:23.724 --> 01:15:26.189
in the vain hope
of saving themselves.

544
01:15:27.458 --> 01:15:29.660
You see. that's why
I never trust the Cossacks.

545
01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:32.397
They are dirty people.

546
01:15:35.701 --> 01:15:37.772
This is personal.

547
01:15:40.277 --> 01:15:41.974
I sense tension here.

548
01:15:43.547 --> 01:15:45.845
Mr. Wick may
probably feel

549
01:15:45.845 --> 01:15:48.585
I'm responsible
for the death of a...

550
01:15:49.516 --> 01:15:50.818
mutual friend.

551
01:15:54.085 --> 01:15:57.154
But I didn't kill Koji.
You did. John.

552
01:15:59.491 --> 01:16:02.361
You know.
this discord
between old friends.

553
01:16:02.361 --> 01:16:03.798
it saddens me.

554
01:16:05.203 --> 01:16:06.196
Allow me to help.

555
01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:10.134
<i>Nein.</i>

556
01:16:11.538 --> 01:16:12.774
We have a deal.

557
01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:16.738
Had.

558
01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:18.274
The Marquis.

559
01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:20.414
Hell. I doubt he'll
mind if it's bullets.

560
01:16:20.414 --> 01:16:22.248
blades or a blind man.

561
01:16:43.071 --> 01:16:45.873
Is this
for me. Mr...

562
01:16:47.176 --> 01:16:48.172
Nobody.

563
01:16:49.943 --> 01:16:52.143
And. no. it's actually
for him.

564
01:16:56.985 --> 01:17:00.120
Then take
a seat.
Mr. Nobody.

565
01:17:04.055 --> 01:17:05.860
Exciting. <i>ja?</i>

566
01:17:15.604 --> 01:17:18.972
So. you want to kill him.

567
01:17:21.642 --> 01:17:22.943
You want to kill him.

568
01:17:24.315 --> 01:17:25.847
I want to kill him.

569
01:17:26.946 --> 01:17:28.751
What about
you. Mr. Wick?

570
01:17:29.419 --> 01:17:31.419
I'm going to kill you.

571
01:17:31.419 --> 01:17:32.751
Oh.

572
01:17:32.751 --> 01:17:35.219
For Pyotr. Of course. <i>ja.</i>

573
01:17:36.761 --> 01:17:39.725
But it looks like
we have ourselves. uh.

574
01:17:39.725 --> 01:17:42.698
a genuine conundrum.

575
01:17:42.698 --> 01:17:46.201
A quandary. if you will.
A real-life dilemma.

576
01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:49.200
So...

577
01:17:50.837 --> 01:17:53.142
How about we play a game?

578
01:17:53.142 --> 01:17:54.271
One hand.

579
01:17:55.139 --> 01:17:57.307
The winner decides who lives...

580
01:17:59.350 --> 01:18:00.810
and who does not.

581
01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:08.852
All right.
What's the buy-in?

582
01:18:08.852 --> 01:18:11.154
More than you can afford.

583
01:18:11.154 --> 01:18:13.022
Yeah.
I'm one bullet away

584
01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:15.226
from being a very rich man.

585
01:18:16.762 --> 01:18:18.130
Or a dead one.

586
01:18:20.403 --> 01:18:23.168
Five-card draw.

587
01:18:47.297 --> 01:18:48.325
Mr. Wick.

588
01:18:49.465 --> 01:18:50.767
Mr. Wick?

589
01:19:14.052 --> 01:19:16.155
Dead man's hand. Mr. Wick.

590
01:19:20.164 --> 01:19:21.160
Well...

591
01:19:22.531 --> 01:19:24.130
I don't gamble.

592
01:19:26.765 --> 01:19:27.969
Let's see.

593
01:19:35.512 --> 01:19:37.777
Four nines. And a four.

594
01:19:37.777 --> 01:19:40.278
Most impressive.

595
01:19:52.122 --> 01:19:55.563
Ah. Royal flush.

596
01:19:55.563 --> 01:19:57.365
Pretty good for a nobody.

597
01:19:57.365 --> 01:19:58.527
Thank you.

598
01:20:00.572 --> 01:20:03.803
A blind man.
a guy with a dog

599
01:20:03.803 --> 01:20:05.838
and John Wick walk into a bar

600
01:20:05.838 --> 01:20:09.306
and take a seat at the table.

601
01:20:09.306 --> 01:20:11.446
That either sounds
like the beginning

602
01:20:11.446 --> 01:20:13.011
of a stupendous joke

603
01:20:13.011 --> 01:20:15.680
or a most
profitable opportunity.

604
01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:22.023
One thinks he can
serve his way out.

605
01:20:26.429 --> 01:20:27.589
One...

606
01:20:28.864 --> 01:20:31.164
thinks he can
buy his way out.

607
01:20:33.997 --> 01:20:35.432
And one...

608
01:20:36.936 --> 01:20:38.402
thinks he can kill

609
01:20:39.476 --> 01:20:40.602
his way out.

610
01:20:43.347 --> 01:20:46.542
Each of them all think
that they have
the winning hand.

611
01:20:47.947 --> 01:20:49.281
But what they fail

612
01:20:50.321 --> 01:20:51.779
to realize

613
01:20:51.779 --> 01:20:55.518
is that the moment they took
a seat at The Table...

614
01:20:58.892 --> 01:21:00.860
they had already lost.

615
01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:03.361
Let me guess.
Five of a kind?

616
01:21:04.997 --> 01:21:06.093
Yeah.

617
01:21:13.544 --> 01:21:15.043
Just so you know.

618
01:21:16.305 --> 01:21:18.376
Pyotr wasn't personal.

619
01:21:20.177 --> 01:21:21.379
Now. maybe a little bit.

620
01:21:24.982 --> 01:21:27.822
Kill!

621
01:22:46.530 --> 01:22:48.466
Hey!
He's over there!

622
01:25:43.606 --> 01:25:45.709
Nuts!

623
01:26:14.277 --> 01:26:16.443
Know what
your problem is.
Mr. Wick?

624
01:26:17.077 --> 01:26:19.512
You are unlucky.

625
01:26:20.982 --> 01:26:22.482
Unlucky in life.

626
01:26:22.982 --> 01:26:24.345
in love.

627
01:26:24.345 --> 01:26:26.222
in friendship...

628
01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:29.687
and now...

629
01:26:31.222 --> 01:26:32.692
in death.

630
01:27:32.187 --> 01:27:34.422
Killa!

631
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:25.968
Why don't you
just die?

632
01:29:33.603 --> 01:29:34.839
He's mine.

633
01:29:36.939 --> 01:29:38.978
I told you
not to take a deal.

634
01:29:38.978 --> 01:29:41.417
Yeah. I guess
your deal didn't
work out either. huh?

635
01:29:42.181 --> 01:29:44.016
Huh?

636
01:29:44.016 --> 01:29:46.554
Hell of a thing
for them to take
your eyes. though.

637
01:29:51.226 --> 01:29:52.461
They didn't take them.

638
01:29:54.624 --> 01:29:55.827
I gave them.

639
01:31:32.124 --> 01:31:34.556
The Ruska Roma
will support

640
01:31:34.556 --> 01:31:35.828
your challenge.

641
01:31:37.059 --> 01:31:38.633
Who will be
your Second?

642
01:32:07.124 --> 01:32:09.961
A warning
of the cost of tyranny.

643
01:32:13.395 --> 01:32:16.731
You must intend
to join your concierge.

644
01:32:16.731 --> 01:32:18.068
Not today.

645
01:32:25.207 --> 01:32:27.314
Per the Old Ways
and the old laws.

646
01:32:27.314 --> 01:32:30.113
John Wick calls you to a duel.

647
01:32:30.113 --> 01:32:32.747
To settle your differences
the old-fashioned way.

648
01:32:32.747 --> 01:32:34.755
as gentlemen should.

649
01:32:36.991 --> 01:32:39.353
You speak of the Old Ways
as if you know them.

650
01:32:40.530 --> 01:32:42.596
A man of Mr. Wick's
station

651
01:32:42.596 --> 01:32:44.358
cannot issue
such a challenge.

652
01:32:45.995 --> 01:32:48.131
He has
his family's crest.

653
01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.135
Hmm.

654
01:32:53.108 --> 01:32:54.142
Berlin.

655
01:32:54.142 --> 01:32:55.602
Ruska Roma challenge.

656
01:32:55.602 --> 01:32:57.606
the acceptance
of Mr. Wick
back into the fold.

657
01:32:57.606 --> 01:32:59.345
it's all there.

658
01:32:59.345 --> 01:33:01.078
Recorded history now.

659
01:33:09.624 --> 01:33:11.324
And why would I
accept this

660
01:33:11.324 --> 01:33:12.960
from a second-rate seat?

661
01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.289
Because there
are rules.
and without them...

662
01:33:15.289 --> 01:33:18.326
We live with
the animals. Exactly.

663
01:33:19.796 --> 01:33:20.999
Mm.

664
01:33:21.898 --> 01:33:23.364
Times are changing.

665
01:33:24.274 --> 01:33:25.702
A new day is dawning.

666
01:33:25.702 --> 01:33:28.644
New ideas. new rules.

667
01:33:29.509 --> 01:33:30.877
new management.

668
01:33:32.942 --> 01:33:35.077
Yet you will accept.

669
01:33:35.077 --> 01:33:39.084
Because we all still sit
beneath The Table.

670
01:33:39.084 --> 01:33:42.383
Even you are not immune
to the consequences of failure.

671
01:33:50.261 --> 01:33:53.328
And what exactly
are Mr. Wick's terms?

672
01:33:54.171 --> 01:33:56.731
<i>Victoriae fiducia.</i>

673
01:33:56.731 --> 01:34:01.710
The unconditional release
of any and all obligations
to The Table.

674
01:34:16.054 --> 01:34:18.959
Ah. history is littered
with Marquis

675
01:34:18.959 --> 01:34:21.389
who were
only remembered
by their servants.

676
01:34:22.198 --> 01:34:23.259
But you...

677
01:34:25.161 --> 01:34:26.601
you could
be remembered

678
01:34:26.601 --> 01:34:29.030
as the man who brought
John Wick.

679
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:30.764
the most
feared of all

680
01:34:30.764 --> 01:34:33.368
by The Table
and all who sit at it.
into the light.

681
01:34:34.838 --> 01:34:36.206
Your light.

682
01:34:38.447 --> 01:34:39.943
And who could predict

683
01:34:39.943 --> 01:34:42.043
how high
that kind of glory

684
01:34:42.043 --> 01:34:44.445
could take a man
in our world?

685
01:35:01.333 --> 01:35:05.070
Noon. <i>La Tour Eiffel.</i>
to discuss rules.

686
01:35:05.935 --> 01:35:07.204
You may go.

687
01:35:08.377 --> 01:35:09.437
When I'm done.

688
01:35:10.879 --> 01:35:12.542
As his Second.
upon his victory.

689
01:35:12.542 --> 01:35:16.278
my Excommunicado
is to be lifted.
my title restored.

690
01:35:16.278 --> 01:35:19.279
my hotel rebuilt
and re-consecrated.

691
01:35:19.279 --> 01:35:21.350
all at
The Table's expense.

692
01:35:23.688 --> 01:35:24.892
Of course.

693
01:35:35.135 --> 01:35:37.839
How you do anything
is how you do everything.

694
01:35:39.771 --> 01:35:40.974
Now I'm done.

695
01:35:45.079 --> 01:35:47.009
I think I'll miss you
when you're gone.

696
01:35:47.009 --> 01:35:49.081
Shame I can't
say the same.

697
01:35:49.981 --> 01:35:51.512
You don't know.
do you?

698
01:35:52.619 --> 01:35:54.821
What's that?

699
01:35:54.821 --> 01:35:57.989
A man's Second.
like his sponsor.

700
01:35:57.989 --> 01:36:00.086
either walks out
with his champion

701
01:36:00.086 --> 01:36:02.061
or is buried beside him.

702
01:36:03.630 --> 01:36:05.163
The Old Ways.

703
01:36:13.409 --> 01:36:14.469
Such is life.

704
01:37:01.823 --> 01:37:03.986
Under the Old Laws.

705
01:37:03.986 --> 01:37:06.253
only one can survive.

706
01:37:06.253 --> 01:37:08.061
Do you both
understand that?

707
01:37:11.798 --> 01:37:13.234
Very good.

708
01:37:13.234 --> 01:37:15.099
Rules.

709
01:37:15.099 --> 01:37:18.005
The Challenged
chooses first. Time?

710
01:37:19.836 --> 01:37:21.107
Sunrise.

711
01:37:26.744 --> 01:37:27.982
Now.

712
01:37:31.752 --> 01:37:33.086
Sunrise.

713
01:37:33.587 --> 01:37:34.582
Location?

714
01:37:35.722 --> 01:37:37.488
You come here

715
01:37:37.488 --> 01:37:40.027
thinking there is
a way out of this world
for you. Mr. Wick?

716
01:37:42.058 --> 01:37:43.327
There is not.

717
01:37:46.195 --> 01:37:48.068
Le Centre Pompidou.

718
01:37:50.770 --> 01:37:52.369
Sacré Coeur.

719
01:37:57.073 --> 01:37:58.342
Sacré Coeur.

720
01:37:59.546 --> 01:38:00.542
Weapons?

721
01:38:01.616 --> 01:38:02.981
If you win.

722
01:38:02.981 --> 01:38:05.052
The Table will
honor its word.

723
01:38:06.152 --> 01:38:07.516
You will have
your freedom.

724
01:38:08.921 --> 01:38:10.354
But you won't take it.

725
01:38:11.624 --> 01:38:12.620
Blades.

726
01:38:18.598 --> 01:38:19.935
Pistols.

727
01:38:24.668 --> 01:38:29.043
Dueling pistols.
Thirty paces.

728
01:38:29.043 --> 01:38:31.509
In the event that
both parties survive.

729
01:38:31.509 --> 01:38:34.977
each will approach the other
at increments of ten paces

730
01:38:34.977 --> 01:38:37.414
until only one remains.

731
01:38:38.852 --> 01:38:40.252
Rules of engagement.

732
01:38:41.524 --> 01:38:42.983
No quarter.

733
01:38:42.983 --> 01:38:45.620
You know why
you won't take
your freedom?

734
01:38:46.494 --> 01:38:47.523
Hmm?

735
01:38:49.029 --> 01:38:51.131
Because this
is who you are.

736
01:38:52.032 --> 01:38:53.562
who you've
always been.

737
01:38:55.836 --> 01:38:57.665
You are a killer.

738
01:39:00.010 --> 01:39:02.642
An orphan we plucked
from the street

739
01:39:02.642 --> 01:39:05.177
and honed into a knife.

740
01:39:05.177 --> 01:39:08.082
And it is the killing
that gives you purpose.

741
01:39:09.082 --> 01:39:11.019
A man
without purpose...

742
01:39:12.819 --> 01:39:14.154
is nothing.

743
01:39:16.559 --> 01:39:17.751
No quarter.

744
01:39:19.387 --> 01:39:21.259
No quarter.

745
01:39:21.259 --> 01:39:24.194
If there is nothing else. gentlemen.

746
01:39:24.194 --> 01:39:26.001
I will see...
A nomination.

747
01:39:30.474 --> 01:39:31.567
It is his right.

748
01:39:33.338 --> 01:39:35.010
Do you have a name?

749
01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:41.247
Caine.

750
01:39:43.785 --> 01:39:45.620
So be it.

751
01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:47.583
Sunrise. Sacré Coeur.

752
01:39:49.188 --> 01:39:51.551
Dueling pistols.
no quarter.

753
01:39:51.551 --> 01:39:54.095
Should Mr. Wick
be victorious.

754
01:39:54.095 --> 01:39:55.992
he will be free of any
and all obligation

755
01:39:55.992 --> 01:39:57.657
to The High Table.

756
01:39:57.657 --> 01:39:59.999
and his Second
will be reinstated

757
01:39:59.999 --> 01:40:02.296
as the manager
of the rebuilt

758
01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:04.072
New York Continental.

759
01:40:05.773 --> 01:40:09.808
Should the Marquis
Vincent Bisset de Gramont
be victorious...

760
01:40:09.808 --> 01:40:11.574
John Wick will be dead.

761
01:40:13.848 --> 01:40:15.380
As will his Second.

762
01:40:17.247 --> 01:40:19.019
Just so.

763
01:40:19.019 --> 01:40:20.415
Now. if there is
nothing more. gentlemen.

764
01:40:20.415 --> 01:40:22.650
I will see you
at sunrise.

765
01:40:22.650 --> 01:40:24.452
Failure to meet
at the appointed hour

766
01:40:24.452 --> 01:40:26.055
will result
in forfeiture

767
01:40:26.055 --> 01:40:28.294
and immediate execution.

768
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:42.341
There is no John
out there.

769
01:40:43.575 --> 01:40:46.345
No happy husband
with a normal life.

770
01:40:49.147 --> 01:40:50.580
There's only John Wick.

771
01:40:51.555 --> 01:40:52.648
the killer.

772
01:40:54.990 --> 01:40:57.125
And he's going to kill you.

773
01:41:03.799 --> 01:41:04.858
<i>Your hotel?</i>

774
01:41:05.963 --> 01:41:07.266
Yes.

775
01:41:07.266 --> 01:41:09.262
You always have
an angle. don't you?

776
01:41:09.262 --> 01:41:11.269
Doesn't everyone?

777
01:41:11.269 --> 01:41:15.142
Let's find safe harbor
before it starts.

778
01:41:15.142 --> 01:41:17.074
There's something
I need to do first.

779
01:41:17.074 --> 01:41:19.543
Sooner rather
than later.

780
01:41:23.246 --> 01:41:24.917
Won't do it.

781
01:41:24.917 --> 01:41:26.451
You fight
your own fight.

782
01:41:30.355 --> 01:41:32.193
Isn't this
what you want?

783
01:41:33.925 --> 01:41:35.389
Hmm?

784
01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:37.198
<i>Victoriae fiducia.</i>

785
01:41:38.228 --> 01:41:39.562
You kill him.

786
01:41:39.562 --> 01:41:41.598
and you and your
daughter will be free.

787
01:41:43.773 --> 01:41:45.272
No one can touch her.

788
01:41:46.775 --> 01:41:48.605
If you don't.

789
01:41:48.605 --> 01:41:51.443
she will have to face
the consequences.

790
01:41:53.013 --> 01:41:55.150
The choice is yours.

791
01:43:21.704 --> 01:43:22.765
Caine.

792
01:43:23.706 --> 01:43:24.833
John.

793
01:43:25.973 --> 01:43:27.341
Saying goodbyes?

794
01:43:29.273 --> 01:43:30.905
Saying hello.

795
01:43:36.185 --> 01:43:37.978
You think your wife
can hear you?

796
01:43:40.590 --> 01:43:41.685
No.

797
01:43:45.256 --> 01:43:46.591
Then why bother?

798
01:43:48.732 --> 01:43:50.265
Maybe I'm wrong.

799
01:43:54.001 --> 01:43:55.600
The dead are gone.

800
01:43:59.172 --> 01:44:00.968
Only the living matter.

801
01:44:06.412 --> 01:44:08.712
After my daughter was born...

802
01:44:10.614 --> 01:44:12.281
I wanted to leave this life.

803
01:44:14.854 --> 01:44:16.291
I thought I did.

804
01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:20.020
But you didn't.

805
01:44:22.293 --> 01:44:23.727
We're damned...

806
01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:26.994
you and I.

807
01:44:28.465 --> 01:44:30.569
On that we agree.

808
01:44:34.636 --> 01:44:36.443
My daughter's not.

809
01:44:39.610 --> 01:44:41.679
If it's between
you and her...

810
01:44:43.853 --> 01:44:45.485
you're going to die.

811
01:44:52.289 --> 01:44:53.856
Maybe not.

812
01:44:59.067 --> 01:45:00.599
I missed you. John.

813
01:45:02.668 --> 01:45:05.472
It's so good
to sit with a friend.

814
01:45:10.441 --> 01:45:12.545
I'll see you tomorrow.

815
01:45:42.608 --> 01:45:45.476
This is how you
resolve the situation?

816
01:45:45.476 --> 01:45:47.680
Duello with
the Baba Yaga.

817
01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:50.913
Failure will shake
the foundation
of The High Table.

818
01:45:52.321 --> 01:45:55.555
and it will turn Wick
into a saint.

819
01:45:58.227 --> 01:46:00.553
My victory will
do the opposite.

820
01:46:03.130 --> 01:46:04.729
Marquis de Gramont!

821
01:46:06.397 --> 01:46:08.563
A man's ambition

822
01:46:08.563 --> 01:46:10.900
should never exceed his worth.

823
01:46:13.772 --> 01:46:16.807
You would do well
to remember that. sir.

824
01:47:37.557 --> 01:47:39.558
<i>Bonjour.</i>
Monsieur Wick.

825
01:47:39.558 --> 01:47:42.494
And welcome
to <i>La Resistance.</i>

826
01:47:42.494 --> 01:47:44.658
A little far from home.
aren't you?

827
01:47:44.658 --> 01:47:46.092
Well. your little act

828
01:47:46.092 --> 01:47:48.728
of uncivil disobedience
inspired me. John.

829
01:47:48.728 --> 01:47:50.400
I'm branching out.

830
01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.703
spreading my wings.

831
01:47:52.703 --> 01:47:54.773
How goes the Grand
Farewell Tour?

832
01:47:56.442 --> 01:47:57.974
Coming to an end.

833
01:47:58.906 --> 01:48:01.241
So it seems. So it seems.

834
01:48:02.418 --> 01:48:04.519
Forty-two regular.
wasn't it?

835
01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:07.046
It's Kevlar.
front to back.

836
01:48:07.046 --> 01:48:08.983
The latest
in ballistic chic.

837
01:48:08.983 --> 01:48:10.854
Appropriate for
all formal occasions.

838
01:48:10.854 --> 01:48:14.055
Weddings. funerals.
High Table duels.

839
01:48:14.055 --> 01:48:15.791
After all. a man
has to look his best

840
01:48:15.791 --> 01:48:17.631
when it's time
to get married.

841
01:48:19.166 --> 01:48:20.161
Or buried.

842
01:48:31.014 --> 01:48:32.074
Forgive me. sir.

843
01:48:32.841 --> 01:48:34.307
but this is madness.

844
01:48:35.511 --> 01:48:36.978
Madness?

845
01:48:36.978 --> 01:48:39.015
Trusting your fate
to a blind man?

846
01:48:40.315 --> 01:48:43.184
There are three types
of men in this world.

847
01:48:44.958 --> 01:48:48.024
Those who
have something
to live for.

848
01:48:48.024 --> 01:48:51.127
those who
have something
to die for.

849
01:48:51.127 --> 01:48:53.994
and those who
have something
to kill for.

850
01:48:53.994 --> 01:48:56.735
John Wick has
none of these things.

851
01:48:56.735 --> 01:49:00.036
He is but a ghost
in search of a graveyard.

852
01:49:01.473 --> 01:49:02.874
But the blind man.

853
01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:05.679
well. he has all three.

854
01:49:07.414 --> 01:49:09.447
Besides. I have a feeling

855
01:49:09.447 --> 01:49:11.646
Mr. Wick will never make it

856
01:49:11.646 --> 01:49:13.819
to the duel by sunrise.

857
01:49:58.662 --> 01:50:00.230
All right. now.

858
01:50:00.230 --> 01:50:03.035
For all you boppers out there
in the City of Lights.

859
01:50:03.035 --> 01:50:07.000
for all you street people
with an ear for the action.

860
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.341
<i>to all my loyal listeners</i>

861
01:50:09.341 --> 01:50:12.343
<i>who know the beat
of the street...</i>

862
01:50:12.343 --> 01:50:16.981
<i>...tonight is your chance
to make some beautiful music.</i>

863
01:50:16.981 --> 01:50:20.518
I've been asked
to relay a special request

864
01:50:20.518 --> 01:50:22.349
<i>from a secret admirer.</i>

865
01:50:23.425 --> 01:50:25.055
<i>It seems there's a thorn</i>

866
01:50:25.055 --> 01:50:28.593
<i>in our little
slice of paradise.</i>

867
01:50:28.593 --> 01:50:30.864
<i>A wicked man from the Big Apple</i>

868
01:50:30.864 --> 01:50:34.295
<i>is making a beeline
to our sacred heart.</i>

869
01:50:35.471 --> 01:50:36.902
<i>We are putting the call out</i>

870
01:50:36.902 --> 01:50:40.841
<i>to deliver your hardest beats
to this man in black.</i>

871
01:50:40.841 --> 01:50:45.245
<i>If you want the prize.
you must finish before sunrise.</i>

872
01:50:45.245 --> 01:50:47.413
This golden oldie.

873
01:50:47.413 --> 01:50:50.515
and I do mean golden hit.

874
01:50:50.515 --> 01:50:53.215
goes out to you. Mr. Wick.

875
01:50:55.118 --> 01:50:58.051
And remember.
there is nowhere to run.

876
01:52:03.856 --> 01:52:05.117
<i>I want to thank you all</i>

877
01:52:05.117 --> 01:52:09.357
<i>for listening to WUXIA.</i>

878
01:52:09.357 --> 01:52:12.597
<i>the place for
all your entertainment</i>

879
01:52:12.597 --> 01:52:14.799
<i>and informational needs.</i>

880
01:52:14.799 --> 01:52:16.264
<i>Good hunting.</i>

881
01:52:18.536 --> 01:52:20.203
And so it begins.

882
01:52:21.542 --> 01:52:23.844
I'm going to need a gun.

883
01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:26.814
I thought
you'd never ask.

884
01:52:28.142 --> 01:52:30.581
Nine-millimeter Pit Viper.

885
01:52:30.581 --> 01:52:32.347
How'd you get this?

886
01:52:32.347 --> 01:52:35.515
I know a guy
who knows a guy
who shot a guy.

887
01:52:36.659 --> 01:52:38.392
Twenty-one round
capacity magazine

888
01:52:38.392 --> 01:52:39.459
with a built-in compensator

889
01:52:39.459 --> 01:52:41.361
for virtually no muzzle flip.

890
01:52:41.361 --> 01:52:43.330
Fiber-optic front sight.

891
01:52:43.330 --> 01:52:44.994
ambidextrous safeties.

892
01:52:44.994 --> 01:52:47.599
flared magwell
for faster reloads.

893
01:52:47.599 --> 01:52:49.637
two-pound
extreme trigger.

894
01:52:49.637 --> 01:52:52.339
and for those more.
how shall we say.

895
01:52:52.339 --> 01:52:54.103
intimate encounters.

896
01:52:54.103 --> 01:52:57.240
this Viper has
ferocious fucking fangs.

897
01:53:02.113 --> 01:53:05.083
How close can you
get me to the church?

898
01:53:10.259 --> 01:53:11.320
Amen.

899
01:53:21.397 --> 01:53:24.069
Here we are.
gentlemen.

900
01:53:25.604 --> 01:53:26.703
Your ride.

901
01:53:30.107 --> 01:53:31.512
When I advised you

902
01:53:31.512 --> 01:53:32.940
not to dip
your pinky

903
01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:34.780
back into this pond.

904
01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:37.115
I didn't think
I'd get wet.

905
01:53:39.887 --> 01:53:42.153
It'll all be over
after today.

906
01:53:45.088 --> 01:53:47.290
When I was
burying Charon.

907
01:53:49.231 --> 01:53:52.262
I was torn about
what to put
on his gravestone.

908
01:53:53.528 --> 01:53:56.898
A few words
to sum up
an entire life?

909
01:53:56.898 --> 01:54:00.036
Long live the king!

910
01:54:00.036 --> 01:54:02.107
Had mine made
years ago.

911
01:54:03.476 --> 01:54:04.510
Modest.

912
01:54:04.510 --> 01:54:06.441
Prophetic.

913
01:54:07.615 --> 01:54:09.246
What did you decide?

914
01:54:10.252 --> 01:54:12.082
Friend.

915
01:54:12.082 --> 01:54:14.581
That's what he was
above all else.

916
01:54:15.357 --> 01:54:16.484
A friend.

917
01:54:25.563 --> 01:54:28.199
<i>Au revoir
et bonne chasse.
Monsieur</i> Wick.

918
01:54:29.933 --> 01:54:31.334
Thank you. King.

919
01:54:33.903 --> 01:54:35.173
Jonathan.

920
01:54:36.311 --> 01:54:37.469
Winston.

921
01:54:37.469 --> 01:54:40.441
Sunrise is at 6:03.

922
01:54:40.441 --> 01:54:43.181
Don't be late for
all our sakes. hmm?

923
01:54:52.726 --> 01:54:54.192
"Loving husband."

924
01:54:54.626 --> 01:54:56.189
Hmm?

925
01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:58.564
That's what I want on mine.

926
01:54:58.564 --> 01:55:01.232
"John. Loving husband."

927
01:55:31.026 --> 01:55:32.296
Confirmed.

928
01:55:33.636 --> 01:55:35.502
<i>Good news. boppers.</i>

929
01:55:35.502 --> 01:55:37.169
We have a sighting.

930
01:55:38.303 --> 01:55:40.136
<i>Our man in black
has been spotted</i>

931
01:55:40.136 --> 01:55:42.472
<i>in the</i> Septième Arrondissement.

932
01:55:42.472 --> 01:55:46.475
<i>I think it's high time
we paint him red.</i>

933
01:57:48.997 --> 01:57:53.206
It seems like
our friends at the guild
dropped the ball.

934
01:57:53.206 --> 01:57:56.205
<i>and now it's rolling
to the Arc de Triomphe.</i>

935
01:57:56.205 --> 01:57:58.211
<i>Let's see who picks it up.</i>

936
02:00:03.001 --> 02:00:04.567
<i>Come on now. people.</i>

937
02:00:04.567 --> 02:00:06.735
We're gonna have
to do a lot better.

938
02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:13.610
<i>Now. who's gonna be
our big winner?</i>

939
02:02:41.325 --> 02:02:42.759
Who is this?

940
02:02:42.759 --> 02:02:44.392
You know. the question
you should be asking.

941
02:02:44.392 --> 02:02:46.125
huh. is how much?

942
02:02:46.125 --> 02:02:48.532
I think we have
the situation under control.

943
02:02:57.343 --> 02:02:59.309
Because the way
I see it.

944
02:02:59.309 --> 02:03:02.141
<i>is that if Mr. Johnny Boy
makes it to the church
on time.</i>

945
02:03:02.141 --> 02:03:04.847
this could be your
last night as Marquis.

946
02:04:17.985 --> 02:04:19.988
<i>A little traffic update.</i>

947
02:04:19.988 --> 02:04:23.630
<i>I'm hearing the boys in black
couldn't get it done.</i>

948
02:04:23.630 --> 02:04:26.532
<i>Our wicked friend
is on the move again.</i>

949
02:04:26.532 --> 02:04:30.570
He's headed your way.
my listeners of the 8th.

950
02:06:34.226 --> 02:06:35.228
Yes?

951
02:06:35.228 --> 02:06:37.691
Fine. You have a deal.

952
02:06:37.691 --> 02:06:39.565
All right. 35 it is.

953
02:06:39.565 --> 02:06:42.497
That wasn't our deal.

954
02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:49.207
Well. that's the only deal
being offered today.

955
02:07:12.763 --> 02:07:13.993
Get him!

956
02:07:22.506 --> 02:07:23.608
Phone!

957
02:07:28.145 --> 02:07:30.281
What?
Now. you
listen to me.

958
02:07:30.281 --> 02:07:31.377
<i>Forty.</i>

959
02:07:32.815 --> 02:07:35.183
You pay for the service.

960
02:07:47.864 --> 02:07:49.934
<i>Good news. boppers.</i>

961
02:07:52.165 --> 02:07:54.466
The lottery just went up.

962
02:12:54.001 --> 02:12:58.044
<i>To all you boppers
still sitting on the side.</i>

963
02:12:58.044 --> 02:13:01.443
<i>Mr. Wick has
the church in sight.</i>

964
02:13:03.048 --> 02:13:05.818
<i>We are almost out of time.</i>

965
02:13:05.818 --> 02:13:07.852
<i>Last chance to win the prize</i>

966
02:13:07.852 --> 02:13:11.522
<i>before Mr. Wick's last sunrise.</i>

967
02:13:11.522 --> 02:13:16.260
<i>So who out there is going
to climb those 222 steps?</i>

968
02:17:55.101 --> 02:17:58.377
It appears Mr. Wick
won't be joining us.

969
02:18:17.293 --> 02:18:18.562
John?

970
02:18:21.263 --> 02:18:22.599
John?

971
02:18:24.134 --> 02:18:25.563
Caine.

972
02:18:25.563 --> 02:18:27.364
What time is sunrise?

973
02:18:30.470 --> 02:18:31.707
Two...

974
02:18:33.013 --> 02:18:34.545
maybe three minutes.

975
02:18:35.846 --> 02:18:39.077
I need you to get to the top
of those stairs. John.

976
02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:44.390
Yeah.

977
02:18:51.491 --> 02:18:52.761
Ready?

978
02:18:53.394 --> 02:18:54.730
Yeah.

979
02:19:13.514 --> 02:19:14.915
Twelve or nine?

980
02:19:16.087 --> 02:19:17.115
Nine.

981
02:19:50.586 --> 02:19:52.425
Six upstairs. Thanks.

982
02:21:07.697 --> 02:21:09.231
<i>Ciao. ciao.</i> Mr. Wick.

983
02:21:22.709 --> 02:21:24.011
You can't shoot me.

984
02:21:28.122 --> 02:21:29.720
Yeah. you're right.

985
02:21:30.519 --> 02:21:31.722
But I can shoot him.

986
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.968
But I can hit you.
motherfucker.

987
02:21:48.372 --> 02:21:49.641
Let's go. John.

988
02:22:15.632 --> 02:22:17.629
Nuts.

989
02:22:25.377 --> 02:22:26.843
You hit my puppy.

990
02:22:43.991 --> 02:22:45.191
You know.
you owe me.

991
02:22:46.198 --> 02:22:47.193
Yeah.

992
02:22:55.871 --> 02:22:57.368
Nothing personal. John.

993
02:22:58.508 --> 02:23:00.140
We're even now.

994
02:23:01.181 --> 02:23:02.373
Yeah.

995
02:23:52.724 --> 02:23:54.799
And so we begin.

996
02:24:15.122 --> 02:24:18.916
We seek the truth
and will endure
the consequences.

997
02:24:18.916 --> 02:24:21.386
Consequences.

998
02:24:41.006 --> 02:24:42.374
Go on now. Come on.

999
02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:22.920
Positions. gentlemen.

1000
02:25:35.933 --> 02:25:38.397
See you
in the next life. brother.

1001
02:25:40.538 --> 02:25:42.137
Thirty paces.

1002
02:26:30.484 --> 02:26:32.891
Remember
your daughter.
Fuck off!

1003
02:26:40.225 --> 02:26:43.132
What a beautiful sunrise.

1004
02:27:02.456 --> 02:27:04.483
Last words. Winston?

1005
02:27:05.855 --> 02:27:07.453
Just have fun out there.

1006
02:27:31.717 --> 02:27:33.578
Are you ready. Mr. Caine?

1007
02:27:40.327 --> 02:27:41.388
Mr. Wick?

1008
02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:07.414
Fire!

1009
02:28:27.705 --> 02:28:29.403
Twenty paces!

Fire!

1011

Nice.

1012
02:29:24.893 --> 02:29:26.691
Ten paces!

1013
02:30:17.012 --> 02:30:18.446
Just kill him.

1014
02:30:38.299 --> 02:30:40.501
Those who cling to death.

1015
02:30:42.102 --> 02:30:43.339
live.

1016
02:30:46.075 --> 02:30:48.278
Those who cling to life.

1018
02:31:00.791 --> 02:31:02.127
Fire!

Rules.
Ha.

You arrogant asshole.

he didn't shoot.

1028
02:32:27.912 --> 02:32:29.346
Consequences.

1029
02:32:45.424 --> 02:32:47.232
That's fucking good.

1030
02:32:59.271 --> 02:33:00.608
Hmm.

Good day.

My brother.

1041
02:34:30.771 --> 02:34:32.364
You owe me one.

1042
02:34:35.005 --> 02:34:36.066
Yeah.

1043
