Fuck.

191
00:16:00.158 --> 00:16:01.026
- What?

192
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.562
- You startled me.

193
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.132
God.

194
00:16:07.165 --> 00:16:08.066
- What are you doing?
- Lend me

195
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.101
one of those skinny arms of
yours okay.

196
00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:10.002
- What?

197
00:16:10.035 --> 00:16:10.702
- Well. you know.
- What's under that?

198
00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:12.404
- My fat arms. they can't fit.

199
00:16:12.437 --> 00:16:13.739
So I'm actually gonna need.

200
00:16:13.772 --> 00:16:15.107
- Mark. I'm not doing anything

201
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.475
until you tell me what is under
that.

202
00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:17.342
- It's a mouse. okay.

203
00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:19.077
it's a mouse.
- What?

204
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.314
- Do you know. big ears. long
tail.

205
00:16:22.347 --> 00:16:24.182
- I know what a mouse is.
dickhead.

206
00:16:24.215 --> 00:16:25.050
- What?
- Why are you

207
00:16:25.083 --> 00:16:26.051
freaking out about it?

208
00:16:26.084 --> 00:16:30.055
- Because I don't want
it here when you know.

209
00:16:31.222 --> 00:16:32.057
- Why?

210
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.891
(birds chirping)

211
00:16:32.924 --> 00:16:34.593
- I don't want it crawling on
me.

212
00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:37.396
(birds chirping)

213
00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:39.831
- You know. you're not
gonna be in a state to care.

214
00:16:39.864 --> 00:16:44.036
- It's gonna go straight
for my eyes. I know it.

215
00:16:47.105 --> 00:16:48.774
- It really doesn't matter.
Mark.

216
00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.309
- Oh. it matters.

217
00:16:51.476 --> 00:16:53.745
Hey. don't. don't. just.

218
00:16:53.778 --> 00:16:55.680
- Get off the me.

219
00:16:55.713 --> 00:16:56.548
- Honey.

220
00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:58.484
Betty. I.

221
00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:04.322
Betty.

222
00:17:04.355 --> 00:17:05.657
Betty.

223
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.560
(birds chirping)

224
00:18:13.491 --> 00:18:15.360
Look. Betty. I.

225
00:18:15.393 --> 00:18:16.261
- Get him?

226
00:18:17.395 --> 00:18:18.263
- Get him?

227
00:18:19.597 --> 00:18:21.733
Pretty sure it was a her.

228
00:18:21.766 --> 00:18:24.503
Only a woman can torment me so
bad.

229
00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:25.871
- So that's a no.

230
00:18:27.872 --> 00:18:29.208
- That's a no.

231
00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:32.211
Look.

232
00:18:32.244 --> 00:18:34.713
- You know what the best
part about all of this is?

233
00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:35.847
- What's that?

234
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.750
(birds chirping)

235
00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:44.289
- We're gonna have to
live with what we've done.

236
00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.160
(birds chirping)

237
00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:53.865
- I shouldn't have grabbed you.

238
00:18:53.898 --> 00:18:54.799
I'm sorry. I.

239
00:18:56.634 --> 00:19:00.572
I was in a frenzy and I didn't
sleep well.

240
00:19:00.605 --> 00:19:01.440
I'm sorry.

241
00:19:03.841 --> 00:19:06.211
Ah. it's okay. Mark. I forgive
you.

242
00:19:06.244 --> 00:19:08.514
It is a honeymoon after all.

243
00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:11.550
You really mean it. Betty?

244
00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:14.619
Oh. really. really. no it's kept
you up.

245
00:19:14.652 --> 00:19:17.523
I mean. if you're insisting on
it.

246
00:19:20.024 --> 00:19:22.327
Shall I Irish up your tea?

247
00:19:27.932 --> 00:19:30.802
- I think I'll finish it as it
is.

248
00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:33.272
- All righty.

249
00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:37.176
(birds chirping)

250
00:20:06.537 --> 00:20:09.541
I hope they find the bad part of
me.

251
00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:11.577
Cut it out.

252
00:20:13.511 --> 00:20:16.381
So I can leave it behind.

253
00:20:16.414 --> 00:20:19.218
(birds chirping)

254
00:20:20.451 --> 00:20:23.021

00:21:03.795 --> 00:21:08.800

Oh. I could have been so many
things.

266
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.142
So many things. now if you think
about it.

267
00:21:51.175 --> 00:21:52.711
- A little drunk?

268
00:21:53.811 --> 00:21:54.746
- Me?

269
00:21:54.779 --> 00:21:55.613
I'm flying.

270
00:21:55.646 --> 00:21:56.881
(both laughing)

271
00:21:56.914 --> 00:21:59.351
- It's a bird. it's a plane.

272
00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:02.721
- Kind of looks like a moose to
me.

273
00:22:02.754 --> 00:22:04.155
- Where?

274
00:22:04.188 --> 00:22:05.757
You don't even have your eyes
open.

275
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.624
- It's that.

276
00:22:06.657 --> 00:22:07.492
(both laughing)

277
00:22:07.525 --> 00:22:08.360
That's the one.

278
00:22:08.393 --> 00:22:10.128
- That confirms it.

279
00:22:10.161 --> 00:22:11.162
Mark's drunk.

280
00:22:11.195 --> 00:22:12.897
(both laughing)

281
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.099
- Yes.

282
00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:15.000
Yes I am.

283
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.802
- Hmm.

284
00:22:17.835 --> 00:22:20.672
(birds chirping)

285
00:22:23.107 --> 00:22:25.510
- [Mark] Can you feel that?

286
00:22:26.477 --> 00:22:27.679
- [Betty] What?

287
00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:32.484
- [Mark] It's the world moving
under you.

288
00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:34.853
(Betty laughing)

289
00:22:34.886 --> 00:22:38.957
- [Betty] I think I need to cut
you off.

290
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.860
- [Mark] It's the grass. the
bugs.

291
00:22:43.127 --> 00:22:44.863
It's a world growing beneath us.

292
00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:45.964
- [Betty] Mm.

293
00:22:45.997 --> 00:22:50.669
- [Mark] I just want to sink
in and let it absorb me.

294
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.073
- But you don't want a
mouse nibbling on you.

295
00:22:55.106 --> 00:22:57.142
- Well. I don't want to be
chewed up

296
00:22:57.175 --> 00:22:58.877
and shat out on the concrete.

297
00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.478
The things only rot.

298
00:23:00.511 --> 00:23:02.781
(Betty laughing)

299
00:23:02.814 --> 00:23:05.550
(gentle music)

300
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:08.854
Well. what do you think?

301
00:23:10.922 --> 00:23:11.756
- [Betty] Mm.

302
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:14.059
I try not to think about it.

303
00:23:15.526 --> 00:23:16.595
- [Mark] Why?

304
00:23:18.896 --> 00:23:21.833
- [Betty] It doesn't matter.

305
00:23:21.866 --> 00:23:23.468
- But it's everything.

306
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:26.171
(birds chirping)

307
00:23:29.707 --> 00:23:32.144
- No. I guess in my situation.

308
00:23:35.513 --> 00:23:37.081
the more that you think about
it.

309
00:23:37.114 --> 00:23:39.885
the more it just rules your
life.

310
00:23:40.885 --> 00:23:43.755
You just have to accept it.

311
00:23:43.788 --> 00:23:45.123
Becoming nothing.

312
00:23:46.757 --> 00:23:48.226
- Becoming nothing?

313
00:23:49.994 --> 00:23:51.763
You become everything.

314
00:23:51.796 --> 00:23:54.766
Every.
- No mark. it's no longer me.

315
00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:57.268
(gentle music)

316
00:23:57.301 --> 00:24:00.172
(birds chirping)

317
00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.877
Doesn't matter what happens
after.

318
00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.546
(gentle music)

319
00:24:08.579 --> 00:24:12.517
At some point. the world
will lose its gravity.

320
00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:16.054
(gentle music)

321
00:24:16.087 --> 00:24:17.055
(birds chirping)

322
00:24:17.088 --> 00:24:18.790
(gentle music)

323
00:24:18.823 --> 00:24:21.693
And we all float up into the
blue.

324
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.129
Everyone and everything.

325
00:24:25.162 --> 00:24:27.165
(gentle music)

326
00:24:27.198 --> 00:24:29.133
(birds chirping)

327
00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:30.902
Swallowed by the sky.

328
00:24:30.935 --> 00:24:33.905
(gentle music)

329
00:24:33.938 --> 00:24:36.941
(birds chirping)

330
00:24:36.974 --> 00:24:39.611
(gentle music)

331
00:24:45.983 --> 00:24:48.219
(birds chirping)

332
00:24:48.252 --> 00:24:50.555
(gentle music)

333
00:24:50.588 --> 00:24:54.259
(both speaking indistinctly)

334
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.174
Get it out.

335
00:25:10.208 --> 00:25:11.976
It's sitting right there in your
belly.

336
00:25:12.009 --> 00:25:13.778
You'll feel better. come on.

337
00:25:13.811 --> 00:25:14.646
(Mark vomiting)

338
00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:15.346
(Mark coughing)

339
00:25:15.379 --> 00:25:16.214
There we go.

340
00:25:16.247 --> 00:25:17.249
There we go.

341
00:25:18.282 --> 00:25:19.617
Good boy.

342
00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.787
That's a good boy.
- Just fuck off.

343
00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.090
- No. hey. hey keep. keep
stroking.

344
00:25:26.123 --> 00:25:28.192
- You're giving me mixed
messages here big guy.

345
00:25:28.225 --> 00:25:30.862
- Just. just stop teasing okay.

346
00:25:32.129 --> 00:25:35.267
It is bad enough I ruined our
weekend.

347
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.304
- You haven't ruined anything.

348
00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:43.007
- Look. I can. I can usually
handle my piss better.

349
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.142
- Mm.

350
00:25:44.175 --> 00:25:45.610
I beg to differ.

351
00:25:47.211 --> 00:25:50.114
- Well. we hardly played
any drinking games.

352
00:25:50.147 --> 00:25:52.884
- Mark. they're hardly
any fun with two people.

353
00:25:52.917 --> 00:25:53.852
It's just us.

354
00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:57.255
- Well yeah. but you know. we
could play.

355
00:25:57.288 --> 00:25:59.724
we could play Categories or.

356
00:26:00.825 --> 00:26:01.960
or I've Never.

357
00:26:03.928 --> 00:26:08.333
- Never have I ever tried
to kill myself with alcohol.

358
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.635
- Not myself.

359
00:26:11.936 --> 00:26:12.770
- Okay.

360
00:26:12.803 --> 00:26:14.806
Who did you try to kill?

361
00:26:16.807 --> 00:26:17.809
- Nevermind.

362
00:26:19.043 --> 00:26:22.847
- Never have I ever
tried to murder anyone.

363
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.249
- I don't have a drink to. to
drink.

364
00:26:25.282 --> 00:26:26.117
- Fuck off.

365
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.652
(Betty laughing)

366
00:26:27.685 --> 00:26:30.655
Who did you try to kill. huh?

367
00:26:30.688 --> 00:26:31.356
- Who?

368
00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:32.257
- Don't worry about it.

369
00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:35.126
- No. now is the time for
confessions.

370
00:26:35.159 --> 00:26:37.061
We're in a safe place.

371
00:26:37.094 --> 00:26:38.997
Who did you try to kill?

372
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.198
Come on tell me.

373
00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:41.099
Who. who?

374
00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:43.969
Mark.

375
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:46.237
- It was you.

376
00:26:47.405 --> 00:26:50.275
(birds chirping)

377
00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:53.778
- What?

378
00:26:58.282 --> 00:26:59.150
- Betty.

379
00:27:01.385 --> 00:27:02.253
Betty.

380
00:27:03.454 --> 00:27:04.789
- Mark. what do you mean?

381
00:27:04.822 --> 00:27:06.324
- [Mark] Betty. I. I.

382
00:27:06.357 --> 00:27:09.361
(insects chirping)

383
00:27:55.206 --> 00:27:57.942
- I'll give you one chance.

384
00:27:57.975 --> 00:27:59.277
- Come on. Betts.

385
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:02.113
I'm already feeling the
hangover.

386
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.116
- Tell me what you did.

387
00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:13.224
- I made a mistake. you know.
that's all.

388
00:28:19.296 --> 00:28:22.067
- What the fuck did you do to
me?

389
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.802
- I didn't plan it okay.

390
00:28:24.835 --> 00:28:29.040
I made a decision in the
moment. a stupid decision.

391
00:28:31.408 --> 00:28:34.145
- I'm glad you put so
much thought into it.

392
00:28:34.178 --> 00:28:37.315
- No. no. no. no. that's
all I've thought about.

393
00:28:37.348 --> 00:28:38.983
You were suffering.

394
00:28:39.016 --> 00:28:40.184
okay. and I couldn't stand it.

395
00:28:40.217 --> 00:28:43.288
I knew you would never ask
it of me. but I could see it.

396
00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:47.258
- See what. hmm?

397
00:28:47.291 --> 00:28:48.159
- You.

398
00:28:49.493 --> 00:28:51.462
You wanted to. you know.

399
00:28:51.495 --> 00:28:52.363
- Die.

400
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:54.299
- Yeah.

401
00:28:56.033 --> 00:28:59.303
- I can't believe what I'm
hearing.

402
00:28:59.336 --> 00:29:02.573
And you just planned to
act on your ESP. huh?

403
00:29:02.606 --> 00:29:04.108
- I didn't plan it. okay.

404
00:29:04.141 --> 00:29:06.811
- When didn't you plan it then?

405
00:29:08.012 --> 00:29:09.514
- This last summer.

406
00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:12.917
- The Engagement party.

407
00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:15.586
You son of a bitch.

408
00:29:15.619 --> 00:29:16.587
- I didn't.
- You son of a bitch.

409
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.488
- I didn't plan it. okay.

410
00:29:17.521 --> 00:29:19.257
Your glass. it was just there.

411
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:22.226
And you. you have to
understand how horrible I felt.

412
00:29:22.259 --> 00:29:23.194
- Horrible?

413
00:29:25.196 --> 00:29:27.465
- Would you like me to
describe the feeling

414
00:29:27.498 --> 00:29:30.067
of a liver resection?

415
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.004
Make you understand the
pain. the torture that I.

416
00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:35.940
that I was in for a month.

417
00:29:35.973 --> 00:29:39.277
They thought that I tried to
kill myself.

418
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:44.248
Have you the slightest idea
what you have put me through.

419
00:29:44.281 --> 00:29:46.083
Do you have any idea what it's
like living

420
00:29:46.116 --> 00:29:49.020
with everyone thinking that
I tried to kill myself.

421
00:29:49.053 --> 00:29:50.054
- I understand.

422
00:29:50.087 --> 00:29:51.289
- No you don't.

423
00:29:52.556 --> 00:29:55.259
It's enough that I'm sick and
you don't fucking understand.

424
00:29:55.292 --> 00:29:57.562
otherwise you wouldn't have.

425
00:30:02.466 --> 00:30:07.272
I can't believe that you are
capable of doing that to me.

426
00:30:08.405 --> 00:30:10.408
I want you to leave now.

427
00:30:14.044 --> 00:30:14.913
Get out.

428
00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:17.548
- You know. I only did
it because I love you.

429
00:30:17.581 --> 00:30:20.218
- Fuck off Mark. honestly.
- No. I need you.

430
00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:22.887
You've gotta understand.
- Get the fuck out.

431
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.622
- Listen to me please.

432
00:30:27.024 --> 00:30:28.292
You were not the first person I
love

433
00:30:28.325 --> 00:30:30.995
who'd asked me to end it. okay.

434
00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:33.898
- I didn't ask you.

435
00:30:44.141 --> 00:30:46.077
- You know what I mean?

436
00:30:57.421 --> 00:31:00.124
(Betty crying)

437
00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:10.535
(gentle music)

438
00:31:24.281 --> 00:31:26.317
(insects chirping)

439
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:29.087
(gentle music)

440
00:31:40.698 --> 00:31:42.567
We'll rise and go now.

441
00:31:44.601 --> 00:31:46.571
go to Innisfree.

442
00:31:47.671 --> 00:31:54.445
in a small cabin made of
clay and wattles... (inaudible)

443
00:31:57.214 --> 00:31:59.317
Something about bees.

444
00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:02.053
(gentle music)

445
00:32:05.189 --> 00:32:07.592
For I shall have some peace.

446
00:32:09.493 --> 00:32:10.328
Some peace.

447
00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:11.696
(gentle music)

448
00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:14.398
The peace comes dropping slow.

449
00:32:14.431 --> 00:32:16.767
Midnight's all a glimmer.

450
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.436
Noon a purple glow.

451
00:32:19.636 --> 00:32:22.640
An evening full of the linnet's
wings.

452
00:32:23.807 --> 00:32:25.977
I will arise and go now.

453
00:32:27.678 --> 00:32:32.016
For always. night and day.
I hear lake water lapping

454
00:32:32.049 --> 00:32:34.285
with low sound by the shore

455
00:32:35.786 --> 00:32:40.458
while I stand on the roadway
or on the pavement's gray.

456
00:32:42.092 --> 00:32:45.463
I hear it in the deep
heart's core. (gentle music)

457
00:32:47.664 --> 00:32:50.601
(insects chirping)

458
00:34:12.916 --> 00:34:15.586
(gentle music)

459
00:34:24.661 --> 00:34:27.498
(birds chirping)

460
00:34:36.607 --> 00:34:39.376
- So what's on the agenda
for this afternoon?

461
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:41.512
- Ah. well there is a bush walk
close by

462
00:34:41.545 --> 00:34:44.849
that I thought we could
do. if you're up for it.

463
00:34:44.882 --> 00:34:46.417
- Yeah.

464
00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:48.219
- So you're up for it?

465
00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:49.887
- Yeah. why wouldn't I be?

466
00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.555
- No. no. I mean you would be.

467
00:34:51.588 --> 00:34:53.757
It's just. you know.
last time I kinda had to

468
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:55.726
carry you back.
- Yeah.

469
00:34:58.195 --> 00:35:00.664
I'm in a much better state.
so I'm up for it okay.

470
00:35:00.697 --> 00:35:02.800
- Okay good. good.

471
00:35:02.833 --> 00:35:05.302
In that case. I've got a
surprise for you.

472
00:35:05.335 --> 00:35:06.437
- Gosh. what?

473
00:35:07.604 --> 00:35:09.573
- It's something you love.

474
00:35:09.606 --> 00:35:10.475
- What?

475
00:35:11.575 --> 00:35:13.177
- Finish your tea.

476
00:35:14.878 --> 00:35:16.580
Come on. finish your tea.

477
00:35:16.613 --> 00:35:18.716
(birds chirping)

478
00:35:18.749 --> 00:35:19.583
- Tell me.

479
00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:22.353
- Finish your tea. I'll finish
mine.

480
00:35:22.386 --> 00:35:25.256
(birds chirping)

481
00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.296
Now look in the bottom.

482
00:35:41.438 --> 00:35:42.406
- Didn't you learn your lesson

483
00:35:42.439 --> 00:35:44.642
about spiking your girlfriend?

484
00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:46.510
- You love acid?

485
00:35:46.543 --> 00:35:48.212
- That's not the point. Mark.

486
00:35:48.245 --> 00:35:49.547
What do you mean?

487
00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.681
- Okay. look. you're gonna have
to relax

488
00:35:50.714 --> 00:35:51.515
if you wanna have a good time.

489
00:35:51.548 --> 00:35:52.816
- Are you actually serious right
now?

490
00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:55.252
- For the next 10 to 12 hours.

491
00:35:55.285 --> 00:35:57.621
- You are absolutely
unbelievable.

492
00:35:57.654 --> 00:35:58.523
- Betty.

493
00:36:03.594 --> 00:36:04.462
- Fuck.

494
00:36:05.929 --> 00:36:07.965
(cupboard banging)

495
00:36:07.998 --> 00:36:10.701
(Betty gasping)

496
00:36:23.914 --> 00:36:26.784
(birds chirping)

497
00:36:32.422 --> 00:36:33.457
- Here.

498
00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:34.925
- I'm okay.

499
00:36:34.958 --> 00:36:36.493
- I didn't say you weren't.

500
00:36:36.526 --> 00:36:40.564
- Just. I'm done with
being tired. I'm done.

501
00:36:40.597 --> 00:36:41.532
- You're done?

502
00:36:41.565 --> 00:36:42.967
- I'm done.

503
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.802
- This exactly what I
said was gonna happen.

504
00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:47.571
Now I'm gonna have to carry
you back down the hill.

505
00:36:47.604 --> 00:36:49.340
just like last time.

506
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.611
- You know what this
weather reminds me of?

507
00:36:53.644 --> 00:36:56.513
- The wife and kids you
left back in Sydney.

508
00:36:56.546 --> 00:36:57.648
"Dante's Inferno?"

509
00:36:57.681 --> 00:36:59.817
No. no. your rational fear of
fire ants.

510
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:04.488
- There's nothing irrational
about fearing fire ants.

511
00:37:04.521 --> 00:37:05.189
- Well?

512
00:37:05.222 --> 00:37:07.458
- No. I'm done talking to you.

513
00:37:07.491 --> 00:37:09.560
- Okay. I wanna know. I wanna
know.

514
00:37:09.593 --> 00:37:11.662
No. you're being a sarcastic
asshole.

515
00:37:11.695 --> 00:37:13.030
- I know.

516
00:37:13.063 --> 00:37:14.999
Don't you love me for who I am.

517
00:37:15.032 --> 00:37:16.900
- You get enough love from
yourself.

518
00:37:16.933 --> 00:37:17.868
(birds chirping)

519
00:37:17.901 --> 00:37:19.270
- Ouch.

520
00:37:19.303 --> 00:37:20.771
Finally comes out.

521
00:37:20.804 --> 00:37:22.773
the truth of how you really
feel.

522
00:37:22.806 --> 00:37:23.807
Well. I beg to differ.

523
00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:27.077
- For once we have a
European summer. you know.

524
00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.580
It's warm. but not too hard.

525
00:37:31.014 --> 00:37:34.685
Like the forest could just
open up onto the Mediterranean.

526
00:37:34.718 --> 00:37:36.787
- Yeah. it beautiful.

527
00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.389
- Yeah.

528
00:37:38.422 --> 00:37:40.491
Gosh. I'd do anything to go
swimming

529
00:37:40.524 --> 00:37:43.527
in that blue. blue water again.

530
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.629
- I mean. the temperature's
a bit like it was.

531
00:37:45.662 --> 00:37:49.767
That doesn't exactly look like
we're in Mykonos or Positano.

532
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.069
but I'm pretty happy about that.

533
00:37:52.102 --> 00:37:54.104
I mean. don't take offense.

534
00:37:54.137 --> 00:37:57.841
I'd rather be nowhere else in
the world.

535
00:37:57.874 --> 00:37:59.310
But now is a good a
time as any to tell you.

536
00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:02.780
but I really didn't like that
trip.

537
00:38:02.813 --> 00:38:04.848
- You're just bitter about the
last week.

538
00:38:04.881 --> 00:38:06.850
- I'm bitter I had to
isolate from you. yeah.

539
00:38:06.883 --> 00:38:08.452
but that's not it.

540
00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:12.523
- Mark. you're the one that got
sick.

541
00:38:12.556 --> 00:38:13.724
- Oh. we were both sick.

542
00:38:13.757 --> 00:38:17.961
Look. it's not that. it's
just. I just don't like Europe.

543
00:38:17.994 --> 00:38:20.964
- It's a pretty big continent to
resent.

544
00:38:20.997 --> 00:38:25.769
- Well. it's just so dirty.
all right and crowded.

545
00:38:25.802 --> 00:38:27.471
Oh. do you remember Rome. hmm?

546
00:38:27.504 --> 00:38:28.706
Do you remember the day
you met up with Lily

547
00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:30.441
and I was left to explore alone?

548
00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:32.009
- Yeah. the day you got sick.

549
00:38:32.042 --> 00:38:33.911
- Yeah. I got heat stroke. okay

550
00:38:33.944 --> 00:38:36.146
'cause the weather was
just like this. but hotter.

551
00:38:36.179 --> 00:38:37.581
And we'd seen all the sites.

552
00:38:37.614 --> 00:38:40.084
and so I was just
walking around this city.

553
00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:42.553
taking in the concrete and the
crowds.

554
00:38:42.586 --> 00:38:43.621
And then I got lost.

555
00:38:43.654 --> 00:38:45.356
- Mark. you were sick
'cause you got blind drunk

556
00:38:45.389 --> 00:38:46.056
the night before.

557
00:38:46.089 --> 00:38:46.924
- What?

558
00:38:46.957 --> 00:38:47.892
No.

559
00:38:47.925 --> 00:38:50.494
Well. yes. but that's not the
point okay.

560
00:38:50.527 --> 00:38:53.130
I got lost and I ended
up outside the Rome Zoo.

561
00:38:53.163 --> 00:38:56.166
this bio park or something.
anyway.

562
00:38:56.199 --> 00:38:58.702
I decided to kill some time to
go on in.

563
00:38:58.735 --> 00:39:00.371
maybe it was to get out of the
sun.

564
00:39:00.404 --> 00:39:02.106
I don't know.
- That was your mistake.

565
00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:05.909
- Yeah. well look. I went in
there and that was just awful.

566
00:39:05.942 --> 00:39:07.111
I mean. you'd think places like
that

567
00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:09.079
were outlawed 50 years ago.

568
00:39:09.112 --> 00:39:11.615
Okay. the elephant
enclosure. it had no shade.

569
00:39:11.648 --> 00:39:12.916
So all of them were just pressed
up

570
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:16.053
against the side of a clay
building. clinging to its
shadow.

571
00:39:16.086 --> 00:39:17.454
And they had wolves all right.

572
00:39:17.487 --> 00:39:19.022
fucking timber wolves in that
heat.

573
00:39:19.055 --> 00:39:21.959
And they were either all
passed out or sedated.

574
00:39:21.992 --> 00:39:24.995
I mean. and the hippo. my God.
that hippo.

575
00:39:25.028 --> 00:39:27.798
he was in an enclosure
the size of our apartment.

576
00:39:27.831 --> 00:39:29.566
The concrete ground of
the pool at its sense.

577
00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:32.636
that was barely the hippo's
length.

578
00:39:32.669 --> 00:39:35.806
Oh my God that fucking hippo.

579
00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:39.710
- So you are basing your whole
judgment of a whole continent

580
00:39:39.743 --> 00:39:42.112
of one trip to a zoo?

581
00:39:42.145 --> 00:39:43.113
- Yeah.

582
00:39:43.146 --> 00:39:46.517
Because Europe made me
feel like that hippo.

583
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:50.454
- Are you honestly incapable
of enjoying anything?

584
00:39:50.487 --> 00:39:52.823
(birds chirping)

585
00:39:52.856 --> 00:39:54.024
- I think so.

586
00:39:54.057 --> 00:39:56.927
(birds chirping)

587
00:39:59.963 --> 00:40:01.899
I think I'm feeling it.

588
00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:04.635
- What's that?

589
00:40:04.668 --> 00:40:06.070
- It's hitting me.

590
00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:09.106
- The acid.

591
00:40:09.139 --> 00:40:10.674
I almost forgot.

592
00:40:10.707 --> 00:40:12.910
- Are you feeling anything?

593
00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:18.682
- Yeah. I think a smidge.

594
00:40:18.715 --> 00:40:20.050
- Yeah.

595
00:40:20.083 --> 00:40:24.021
- How broccoli of the trees
right now?

596
00:40:24.054 --> 00:40:25.556
- About a six.

597
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:26.690
(both laughing)

598
00:40:26.723 --> 00:40:28.625
- We're getting there.

599
00:40:28.658 --> 00:40:30.894
Nearly. nearly. nearly.

600
00:40:30.927 --> 00:40:33.564
(gentle music)

601
00:40:37.634 --> 00:40:40.704
(birds chirping)

602
00:40:40.737 --> 00:40:43.240
(gentle music)

603
00:40:46.176 --> 00:40:47.578
(birds chirping)

604
00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:49.580
(gentle music)

605
00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:51.515
That's a lot of green.

606
00:40:51.548 --> 00:40:54.051
(gentle music)

607
00:40:55.118 --> 00:40:57.922
(birds chirping)

608
00:40:59.789 --> 00:41:02.460
(gentle music)

609
00:41:03.593 --> 00:41:05.128
(birds chirping)

610
00:41:05.161 --> 00:41:05.996
Jeez.

611
00:41:06.029 --> 00:41:06.864
Fuck.

612
00:41:08.932 --> 00:41:10.767
A fucking snake.

613
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.169
(gentle music)

614
00:41:12.202 --> 00:41:14.571
(Mark speaking indistinctly)

615
00:41:14.604 --> 00:41:17.241
(birds chirping)

616
00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:19.944
(gentle music)

617
00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:28.685
(people speaking indistinctly)

618
00:41:28.718 --> 00:41:31.188
(gentle music)

619
00:41:34.724 --> 00:41:38.195
(people speaking indistinctly)

620
00:41:38.228 --> 00:41:40.898
(gentle music)

621
00:41:41.965 --> 00:41:44.835
(Mark laughing)

622
00:41:44.868 --> 00:41:45.702
(gentle music)

623
00:41:45.735 --> 00:41:46.670
(birds chirping)

624
00:41:46.703 --> 00:41:47.337
Holy shit.

625
00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:50.040
(gentle music)

626
00:42:00.884 --> 00:42:03.153
(Betty laughing)

627
00:42:03.186 --> 00:42:04.021
- Oh God.

628
00:42:04.054 --> 00:42:06.757
(gentle music)

629
00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:10.561
- Wake up.

630
00:42:12.195 --> 00:42:13.130
- Don't joke.

631
00:42:13.163 --> 00:42:15.265
You know what was the best day
of my life.

632
00:42:15.298 --> 00:42:16.567
- It's the day you met me.

633
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.868
- No.

634
00:42:17.901 --> 00:42:20.137
Unfortunately for your ego.

635
00:42:21.404 --> 00:42:23.173
I was about 12 or 13.

636
00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:26.777
Do you remember those. do
you remember these comments?

637
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:29.813
The. the. the chain mail or
MySpace?

638
00:42:30.814 --> 00:42:32.349
- Look. I remember MySpace.

639
00:42:32.382 --> 00:42:33.283
I don't remember Yala.

640
00:42:33.316 --> 00:42:34.751
- Yeah.

641
00:42:34.784 --> 00:42:38.221
So it was one of those. you
know.

642
00:42:38.254 --> 00:42:39.790
I think it was like.

643
00:42:39.823 --> 00:42:41.325
"If you pass this on in 10 days.

644
00:42:41.358 --> 00:42:44.227
"then in a week. you'll have
the best day of your life

645
00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.196
"and in two weeks you'll
meet the love of your life."

646
00:42:46.229 --> 00:42:47.130
Or something like that.

647
00:42:47.164 --> 00:42:49.199
- Yeah. yeah and if you don't.
you'll die

648
00:42:49.232 --> 00:42:50.767
or the chick from the ring will
get you.

649
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.635
- Yeah.

650
00:42:51.668 --> 00:42:52.336
(both laughing)

651
00:42:52.369 --> 00:42:54.671
- So I passed on one of those.

652
00:42:54.704 --> 00:42:56.640
- Oh. you are what's
wrong with this world.

653
00:42:56.673 --> 00:42:57.942
- Shut up. Mark.

654
00:42:59.743 --> 00:43:00.911
I passed on one of those

655
00:43:00.944 --> 00:43:05.749
and the next week I actually
had the best day of my life.

656
00:43:05.782 --> 00:43:08.051
I don't know. nothing happened
or changed

657
00:43:08.084 --> 00:43:10.721
because of the chain mail. but.

658
00:43:11.855 --> 00:43:14.925
I don't know. I just took
everything in.

659
00:43:14.958 --> 00:43:16.893
I'd never been so present.

660
00:43:16.926 --> 00:43:18.428
(birds chirping)

661
00:43:18.461 --> 00:43:23.767
Things I'd done a million times
suddenly became wonderful.

662
00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.436
I don't know. it's hard to
explain.

663
00:43:26.469 --> 00:43:28.372
It wasn't even sunny.

664
00:43:28.405 --> 00:43:31.642
It was raining. but it was
beautiful.

665
00:43:33.276 --> 00:43:34.645
- No. I get it.

666
00:43:36.379 --> 00:43:39.316
Have you had a day like that
since?

667
00:43:40.216 --> 00:43:41.285
- I think so.

668
00:43:43.386 --> 00:43:45.823
Nowhere as good. but I have.

669
00:43:47.857 --> 00:43:51.428
I think it happens when
I have a recurrence.

670
00:43:53.763 --> 00:43:55.032
I think I'm feeling it.

671
00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:57.835
(both laughing)

672
00:43:59.836 --> 00:44:00.871
- Yeah.

673
00:44:00.904 --> 00:44:04.441
I swear I only feel that way on
drugs.

674
00:44:04.474 --> 00:44:05.976
Well. some drugs.

675
00:44:07.444 --> 00:44:10.247
Most kinda just push you away
from it.

676
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.282
from the present.

677
00:44:12.315 --> 00:44:15.085
Now that's the problem.

678
00:44:15.118 --> 00:44:17.021
It's not being present.

679
00:44:18.121 --> 00:44:20.257
I was a bit of a depressed kid.

680
00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.893
I think I watched too much TV.

681
00:44:23.793 --> 00:44:27.431
I just. I always wanted
to be somewhere else.

682
00:44:28.531 --> 00:44:30.300
somewhere green.

683
00:44:30.333 --> 00:44:31.368
- Hmm.

684
00:44:31.401 --> 00:44:35.005
- You know. in some
fantasy world full of magic

685
00:44:35.038 --> 00:44:38.308
where I was the chosen
one in a great story.

686
00:44:38.341 --> 00:44:40.778
You know. and I had friends.

687
00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:47.184
God. I was always in my head.
you know.

688
00:44:47.217 --> 00:44:49.486
and I. I never looked around

689
00:44:49.519 --> 00:44:52.322
'cause it just made me sad

690
00:44:52.355 --> 00:44:56.259
'cause it wasn't where I wanted
to be.

691
00:44:56.292 --> 00:45:00.263
Yeah. there's nothing
fantastical about the suburbs.

692
00:45:00.296 --> 00:45:02.900
So I would live in a daydream.

693
00:45:05.535 --> 00:45:08.839
And that way of thinking. you
know. at least for so long.

694
00:45:08.872 --> 00:45:12.009
I think it built pathways in my
brain.

695
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:16.880
I can't be present and it kills
me.

696
00:45:16.913 --> 00:45:18.982
(gentle music)

697
00:45:19.015 --> 00:45:20.851
It's like I'm drifting.

698
00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:22.219
(gentle music)

699
00:45:22.252 --> 00:45:26.123
Holding my breath as the
waves crash above me.

700
00:45:28.224 --> 00:45:31.795
I wanted that feeling
that you're talking about.

701
00:45:31.828 --> 00:45:32.896
so damn much.

702
00:45:34.831 --> 00:45:38.435
And this weekend I'm starting to
feel it.

703
00:45:38.468 --> 00:45:40.270
(gentle music)

704
00:45:40.303 --> 00:45:42.572
It's like what you said.

705
00:45:42.605 --> 00:45:45.175
it happens after a recurrence.

706
00:45:45.208 --> 00:45:47.477
(gentle music)

707
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:50.380
It's when you've accepted it.
isn't it?

708
00:45:50.413 --> 00:45:51.248
(gentle music)

709
00:45:51.281 --> 00:45:52.783
I've accepted it.

710
00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:55.118
- I've.

711
00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:59.490
- We're free from our future
so we can finally be present.

712
00:46:01.958 --> 00:46:03.393
We're free.

713
00:46:03.426 --> 00:46:06.096
(gentle music)

714
00:46:16.906 --> 00:46:19.409
(Betty crying)

715
00:46:22.612 --> 00:46:25.282
(gentle music)

716
00:46:28.518 --> 00:46:31.188
(Betty crying)

717
00:46:36.159 --> 00:46:38.796
(gentle music)

718
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:43.266
(insects chirping)

719
00:46:43.299 --> 00:46:45.635
(gentle music)

720
00:46:45.668 --> 00:46:48.939
(insects chirping)

721
00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:51.441
(gentle music)

722
00:47:28.645 --> 00:47:31.648
(insects chirping)

723
00:48:09.352 --> 00:48:10.654
- Shh. shh. shh.

724
00:48:11.754 --> 00:48:12.623
Shh. shh.

725
00:48:13.656 --> 00:48:15.091
- What?

726
00:48:15.124 --> 00:48:16.459
- Shh.

727
00:48:16.492 --> 00:48:19.363
(dramatic music)

728
00:48:25.601 --> 00:48:28.238
- Come on. go. go. go.

729
00:48:28.271 --> 00:48:31.074
(dramatic music)

730
00:48:34.377 --> 00:48:35.345
- Hey wait.

731
00:48:35.378 --> 00:48:36.212
- Ow.

732
00:48:36.245 --> 00:48:37.180
- No. get off me.

733
00:48:37.213 --> 00:48:39.082
- Shush. shush. do you
want him to find us?

734
00:48:39.115 --> 00:48:40.150
- Don't. don't.

735
00:48:40.183 --> 00:48:41.017
- What?

736
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:41.718
Don't what?

737
00:48:41.751 --> 00:48:42.585
- Stop.
- What?

738
00:48:42.618 --> 00:48:44.120
- Don't touch me.

739
00:48:44.153 --> 00:48:45.655
- Okay.

740
00:48:45.688 --> 00:48:47.958
Can you please hide with me?

741
00:48:47.991 --> 00:48:49.092
- Where the fuck have you.

742
00:48:49.125 --> 00:48:50.327
- Shh.

743
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.995
- Where have you been?

744
00:48:52.028 --> 00:48:53.597
- Where have I been?

745
00:48:55.231 --> 00:48:56.934
- I don't know. hey.

746
00:48:57.667 --> 00:49:00.003
It's been a long couple of
hours.

747
00:49:00.036 --> 00:49:02.439
I think the acid turned on me.

748
00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:06.109
Hey. why'd you run away?

749
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:08.478
Betty?

750
00:49:08.511 --> 00:49:09.346
- I.

751
00:49:12.248 --> 00:49:13.450
Things Mark. I.

752
00:49:14.684 --> 00:49:18.221
- You wanna take a seat and
tell me about these things. hmm?

753
00:49:18.254 --> 00:49:20.623
I'll tell you about my stuff.

754
00:49:20.656 --> 00:49:23.593
(insects chirping)

755
00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:30.000
- Fuck.

756
00:49:36.339 --> 00:49:39.242
- What the fuck was that guy
doing?

757
00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:42.478
- I don't know. he sounded like.

758
00:49:42.511 --> 00:49:44.514
- Well he sounded like he was
gonna put us in that hole.

759
00:49:44.547 --> 00:49:47.250
- No. he sounded like familiar.

760
00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:51.254
- [Mark] I need a big stick.

761
00:49:51.287 --> 00:49:53.490
- Mark. are we sure that even
happened?

762
00:49:53.523 --> 00:49:56.526
- Well. it's acid all
right. it's not fucking DMT.

763
00:49:56.559 --> 00:49:57.694
- I know that.

764
00:50:03.199 --> 00:50:04.067
- Nevermind.

765
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.068
- What?

766
00:50:05.101 --> 00:50:08.204
(insects chirping)

767
00:50:08.237 --> 00:50:11.307
- Has this got to do
with why you ran away?

768
00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.344
(insects chirping)

769
00:50:17.547 --> 00:50:18.382
May I?

770
00:50:19.515 --> 00:50:22.519
(insects chirping)

771
00:50:24.454 --> 00:50:26.156
- Yeah.

772
00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:29.192
(insects chirping)

773
00:50:32.261 --> 00:50:33.263
- Well then.

774
00:50:34.597 --> 00:50:36.199
what do we do now?

775
00:50:38.801 --> 00:50:42.372
- I don't think I have
it in me to move. so.

776
00:50:42.405 --> 00:50:45.409
(insects chirping)

777
00:50:49.412 --> 00:50:51.781
- Do you think a cheeky
fuck would be too noisy?

778
00:50:51.814 --> 00:50:55.785
- Yeah. let's just fuck right
in front of the hooded man.

779
00:50:55.818 --> 00:50:56.653
No. Mark.

780
00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:58.354
- Okay.

781
00:50:58.387 --> 00:50:59.556
It was a joke.

782
00:51:02.158 --> 00:51:02.826
What?

783
00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:05.762
- Stop thinking about it.

784
00:51:05.795 --> 00:51:08.498
(both laughing)

785
00:51:10.633 --> 00:51:13.637
(insects chirping)

786
00:53:01.644 --> 00:53:03.280
Do you think as we.

787
00:53:06.649 --> 00:53:09.853
do you think as we get closer to
death.

788
00:53:11.554 --> 00:53:14.691
I don't know. as we ride the
line. we.

789
00:53:15.758 --> 00:53:19.028
we start to see things on the
other side.

790
00:53:19.061 --> 00:53:20.530
- I think I'm still a little too
high

791
00:53:20.563 --> 00:53:23.300
to be talking about ghosts. but.

792
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.773
- Not necessarily ghosts. just.

793
00:53:32.608 --> 00:53:37.680
I dunno. it's like getting your
feet wet on a sinking ship.

794
00:53:37.713 --> 00:53:41.284
- Look at this staunch atheist
now.

795
00:53:41.317 --> 00:53:43.620
- It's less about believing.

796
00:53:46.555 --> 00:53:48.591
It's like a feeling.

797
00:53:48.624 --> 00:53:50.860
(gentle music)

798
00:53:50.893 --> 00:53:53.529
(insects chirping)

799
00:53:53.562 --> 00:53:54.397
- No. I.

800
00:53:55.431 --> 00:53:56.633
I get it.

801
00:53:56.666 --> 00:53:57.834
(gentle music)

802
00:53:57.867 --> 00:54:00.503
(insects chirping)

803
00:54:00.536 --> 00:54:02.639
You know. when my mom died. I.

804
00:54:02.672 --> 00:54:04.808
I swear I kept seeing her.

805
00:54:07.843 --> 00:54:10.013
you know. her face.

806
00:54:10.046 --> 00:54:11.715
everywhere. I mean.

807
00:54:12.715 --> 00:54:14.584
When I closed my eyes.

808
00:54:15.451 --> 00:54:16.453
in the dark.

809
00:54:18.087 --> 00:54:21.557
You know. I don't know if it
was my brain dealing with death

810
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:25.395
or it was just a part of
mourning or.

811
00:54:25.428 --> 00:54:27.730
- Mark. when you want something
so badly.

812
00:54:27.763 --> 00:54:28.598
your brain can just make it up.

813
00:54:28.631 --> 00:54:30.633
- I know but this.

814
00:54:30.666 --> 00:54:32.468
this felt stranger than that.

815
00:54:32.501 --> 00:54:34.370
(gentle music)

816
00:54:34.403 --> 00:54:36.539
I mean. it was so painful.

817
00:54:39.141 --> 00:54:43.646
You know. I started to try and
make myself forget her face.

818
00:54:43.679 --> 00:54:46.383
(gentle music)

819
00:54:47.616 --> 00:54:48.818
My own mother's.

820
00:54:48.851 --> 00:54:51.454
(gentle music)

821
00:54:51.487 --> 00:54:54.090
Just so I wouldn't feel
the dagger in my heart

822
00:54:54.123 --> 00:54:57.727
every time I realized
she wasn't really there.

823
00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.797
(gentle music)

824
00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:01.965
- Did it work?

825
00:55:03.933 --> 00:55:06.602
- I think it goes deeper than
memory.

826
00:55:06.635 --> 00:55:08.871
(gentle music)

827
00:55:08.904 --> 00:55:11.841
(insects chirping)

828
00:55:11.874 --> 00:55:13.710
(gentle music)

829
00:55:13.743 --> 00:55:16.879
- Like light from a dead star.

830
00:55:16.912 --> 00:55:17.847
- Yeah.

831
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.550
(gentle music)

832
00:55:25.187 --> 00:55:28.124
(insects chirping)

833
00:55:35.464 --> 00:55:38.335
(birds chirping)

834
00:56:03.692 --> 00:56:06.429
(gentle music)

835
00:56:17.773 --> 00:56:19.042
- Just tell him.

836
00:56:22.912 --> 00:56:24.414
This is my fault.

837
00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:31.621
Mark. I came here because I love
you.

838
00:56:32.788 --> 00:56:34.724
(gentle music)

839
00:56:34.757 --> 00:56:37.226
(birds chirping)

840
00:56:37.259 --> 00:56:39.729
Mark. we are our own rivers.

841
00:56:41.497 --> 00:56:42.432
(birds chirping)

842
00:56:42.465 --> 00:56:43.533
(gentle music)

843
00:56:43.566 --> 00:56:45.701
I am my own vessel.

844
00:56:45.734 --> 00:56:48.638
(gentle music)

845
00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:50.173
I am my own vessel.

846
00:56:51.173 --> 00:56:52.942
(gentle music)

847
00:56:52.975 --> 00:56:55.111
(birds chirping)

848
00:56:55.144 --> 00:56:56.913
I am my own vessel.

849
00:56:56.946 --> 00:56:58.781
(gentle music)

850
00:56:58.814 --> 00:56:59.849
(Betty crying)

851
00:56:59.882 --> 00:57:01.884
(birds chirping)

852
00:57:01.917 --> 00:57:04.587
(gentle music)

853
00:57:05.988 --> 00:57:07.991
Ooh. I am my own vessel.

854
00:57:09.525 --> 00:57:11.995
(gentle music)

855
00:57:14.997 --> 00:57:17.133
I am my own vessel.

856
00:57:17.166 --> 00:57:20.236
(gentle music)

857
00:57:20.269 --> 00:57:21.938
I am my own vessel.

858
00:57:23.205 --> 00:57:25.908
(gentle music)

859
00:57:25.941 --> 00:57:28.744
(birds chirping)

860
00:57:28.777 --> 00:57:31.247
(gentle music)

861
00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.950
(birds chirping)

862
00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:36.619
(gentle music)

863
00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:12.922
(insects chirping)

864
00:58:20.095 --> 00:58:23.766
- Why didn't you wake
me for sunset. Betty?

865
00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:29.238
- It takes effort to sleep 12
hours.

866
00:58:29.271 --> 00:58:30.339
- What?

867
00:58:30.372 --> 00:58:34.911
- If you wanted to wake
for sunset. you would have.

868
00:58:36.011 --> 00:58:38.815
- Well. I wanted to and I
didn't.

869
00:58:40.182 --> 00:58:42.785
Nothing I haven't seen before.

870
00:58:48.891 --> 00:58:49.826
Not hungry?

871
00:58:50.993 --> 00:58:53.830
- Nothing I haven't tasted
before.

872
00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:58.835
- I'm sorry for getting antsy. I
just.

873
00:59:00.836 --> 00:59:04.140
just wanted this weekend to be
perfect.

874
00:59:04.173 --> 00:59:06.109
It's typical. isn't it?

875
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:08.177
- What is?

876
00:59:09.411 --> 00:59:12.649
- Life. not going the way you
expect.

877
00:59:15.951 --> 00:59:18.387
- How did you want this weekend
to go?

878
00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:19.289
- I dunno.

879
00:59:21.156 --> 00:59:22.025
Better.

880
00:59:22.892 --> 00:59:26.862
I think my expectations were too
high.

881
00:59:26.895 --> 00:59:28.297
Too much pressure maybe.

882
00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:30.399
Maybe we should have just
buttoned the curtains.

883
00:59:30.432 --> 00:59:32.668
stayed in the bedroom the whole
time.

884
00:59:32.701 --> 00:59:33.570
- Maybe.

885
00:59:39.074 --> 00:59:40.577
Do you wish that.

886
00:59:44.346 --> 00:59:48.017
do you wish that we had more
time?

887
00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:48.918
- No.

888
00:59:50.185 --> 00:59:53.056
- We've had more than enough
time.

889
00:59:59.261 --> 01:00:00.296
Is there something wrong?

890
01:00:00.329 --> 01:00:03.232
I mean. besides you being
hangry and not eating.

891
01:00:03.265 --> 01:00:04.800
- I'm not hangry.

892
01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:06.903
- Yeah. I've heard that before.

893
01:00:08.904 --> 01:00:13.275
You don't think I've been going
crazy nervous over all this?

894
01:00:13.308 --> 01:00:17.179
I've been going as crazy
as you have all weekend.

895
01:00:17.212 --> 01:00:20.383
But now it's just time for us to
relax.

896
01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:22.418
Savor what we have left.

897
01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:24.754
Right. it might not be perfect

898
01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:28.057
so just make the best of what
we've got.

899
01:00:32.027 --> 01:00:33.896
- I don't want to die.

900
01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:37.733
- Unfortunately. you
don't have a choice in it.

901
01:00:37.766 --> 01:00:40.369
- I have a choice in time.
- This is your choice in time.

902
01:00:40.402 --> 01:00:41.236
- Yes.
- This weekend

903
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:42.672
is the only time you'll get a
choice.

904
01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:44.707
- Yes. and it's my choice.

905
01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.075
- And you made it.

906
01:00:46.108 --> 01:00:48.377
When you came here. you made it.

907
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:51.080
The decision was final when
you walked through that door.

908
01:00:51.113 --> 01:00:53.249
- It is my decision. Mark.

909
01:01:00.723 --> 01:01:02.858
- Do you think those
machines that keep you alive

910
01:01:02.891 --> 01:01:06.829
will give you a second chance to
end it?

911
01:01:06.862 --> 01:01:09.432
What about the doctors. nurses.

912
01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:13.769
I mean. you think they'll
give you a second chance?

913
01:01:13.802 --> 01:01:17.239
Surely when you are rotting
from the inside out.

914
01:01:17.272 --> 01:01:20.943
surely when you're begging to
die.

915
01:01:20.976 --> 01:01:24.313
I mean. you think they'll show
you mercy?

916
01:01:24.346 --> 01:01:26.416
- No. they fucking won't.

917
01:01:34.389 --> 01:01:37.093
(Betty crying)

918
01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:39.128
You can't run from this.

919
01:01:42.297 --> 01:01:43.366
No you can't.

920
01:01:49.571 --> 01:01:52.308
(door slamming)

921
01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:06.322
(door banging)

922
01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:07.456
- [Mark] Betty.

923
01:02:07.489 --> 01:02:09.825
Betty. what have you done with
'em?

924
01:02:09.858 --> 01:02:11.761
Betty. let me in.

925
01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:13.929
- Not until you calm down.

926
01:02:13.962 --> 01:02:15.765
- [Mark] I don't sound calm.

927
01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:16.499
- No.

928
01:02:17.499 --> 01:02:18.567
- [Mark] Well. maybe it's
because

929
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.971
you're trying to ruin my life.

930
01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:23.539
- You are being dramatic.

931
01:02:23.572 --> 01:02:25.040
- Dramatic?

932
01:02:25.073 --> 01:02:27.276
You talked about choice before.

933
01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:31.247
You're taking away my
choice. my choice. Betty.

934
01:02:32.881 --> 01:02:34.050
Open the door.

935
01:02:35.117 --> 01:02:38.454
Open the door or I'll break it
down.

936
01:02:38.487 --> 01:02:39.989
Please. please I.

937
01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:44.227
I don't wanna live.

938
01:02:45.327 --> 01:02:46.996
not without you. I.

939
01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:50.833
I don't wanna be alone again.

940
01:02:50.866 --> 01:02:52.434
I don't want you to be alone.

941
01:02:52.467 --> 01:02:53.668
(gentle music)

942
01:02:53.702 --> 01:02:58.207
I can't stand it. the thought
of you somewhere else alone.

943
01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:01.977
- There's nowhere else.

944
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:04.580
(gentle music)

945
01:03:07.916 --> 01:03:10.486
I am not gonna be used as your
excuse.

946
01:03:10.519 --> 01:03:11.821
(gentle music)

947
01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:14.924
My fucking cancer is not your
excuse.

948
01:03:17.159 --> 01:03:18.161
- An excuse?

949
01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:21.630
Yeah.

950
01:03:21.663 --> 01:03:22.498
You know what?

951
01:03:22.531 --> 01:03:24.133
I need an excuse okay.

952
01:03:24.166 --> 01:03:28.137
because I can't live outside our
bubble.

953
01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:30.272
Every second out there with
those.

954
01:03:30.305 --> 01:03:32.842
those fake fucking drones.

955
01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:35.244
being another fake fucking drone

956
01:03:35.277 --> 01:03:39.582
and listening to myself talk
like a fake fucking drone.

957
01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:42.952
(gentle music)

958
01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:44.253
It's unbearable.

959
01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:48.524
(gentle music)

960
01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.562
- It's like I'm in a cage and
it's.

961
01:03:53.595 --> 01:03:55.364
it's growing smaller and
smaller.

962
01:03:55.397 --> 01:03:58.100
And if I escaped. I'd tear the
limbs

963
01:03:58.133 --> 01:04:01.670
of every snide-face
phony out there. I would.

964
01:04:01.703 --> 01:04:02.671
(gentle music)

965
01:04:02.704 --> 01:04:05.307
I'd tear it all fucking down.

966
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:08.077
(gentle music)

967
01:04:09.711 --> 01:04:11.881
I couldn't even breathe.

968
01:04:12.614 --> 01:04:13.616
It's toxic.

969
01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:17.152
The exhausts. the perfume.

970
01:04:17.185 --> 01:04:20.122
artificial to the fucking
molecule.

971
01:04:21.523 --> 01:04:23.292
I despise that world.

972
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.562
I hate it.

973
01:04:26.595 --> 01:04:29.498
(gentle music)

974
01:04:29.531 --> 01:04:31.267
I hate myself.

975
01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:34.036
(gentle music)

976
01:04:39.374 --> 01:04:42.578
And then I look up and the sky
is blue.

977
01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:51.287
I thought the world is getting
smaller.

978
01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.225
It stays so vast.

979
01:05:00.395 --> 01:05:02.031
So vast.

980
01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:04.634
(gentle music)

981
01:05:35.697 --> 01:05:36.966
Mark?

982
01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:44.106
Mark?

983
01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:56.319
Mark?

984
01:06:02.324 --> 01:06:03.426
Mark?

985
01:06:09.164 --> 01:06:09.865
Give them to me.

986
01:06:09.898 --> 01:06:11.700
I said give them to me.
- Here.

987
01:06:11.733 --> 01:06:21.543
[inaudible muttering]

988
01:06:21.576 --> 01:06:24.313
I emptied them this morning.

989
01:06:24.346 --> 01:06:27.016
(gentle music)

990
01:06:36.191 --> 01:06:38.694
(insects chirping)

991
01:06:38.727 --> 01:06:41.397
(gentle music)

992
01:06:54.543 --> 01:06:58.147
(Betty exhaling)

993
01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.183
(insects chirping)

994
01:07:33.248 --> 01:07:36.285
(Betty moaning)

995
01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:37.252
No.

996
01:07:37.285 --> 01:07:40.456
(Betty crying)

997
01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:42.091
Mark. stop please.

998
01:07:43.525 --> 01:07:44.860
Mark. stop. stop.

999
01:07:47.562 --> 01:07:48.631
- Fuck. fuck.

1000
01:07:49.798 --> 01:07:50.632
- Stop.

1001
01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:53.402
- This could have been easier.
Betty.

1002
01:07:53.435 --> 01:07:55.337
This could have been so much
easier.

1003
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:56.205
- Please.

1004
01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:57.173
(gentle music)

1005
01:07:57.206 --> 01:08:00.342
- I won't let you make this
mistake. okay.

1006
01:08:00.375 --> 01:08:01.243
Betty.

1007
01:08:02.444 --> 01:08:03.679
- I said fucking stop.

1008
01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:05.380
- What are you gonna do with
that?

1009
01:08:05.413 --> 01:08:06.615
- Listen to me. Mark.

1010
01:08:06.648 --> 01:08:07.482
- [Mark] Are you gonna kill me?

1011
01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:09.218
- I shouldn't have indulged in
this.

1012
01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:11.253
- It's too late.
- You are sick.

1013
01:08:11.286 --> 01:08:13.388
You are sick and I made you
worse.

1014
01:08:13.421 --> 01:08:15.190
- Once we walked through those
days.

1015
01:08:15.223 --> 01:08:16.825
it's too late.
- I'm sorry.

1016
01:08:16.858 --> 01:08:19.328
I'm sorry.
- I have to do this.

1017
01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:20.162
- I'm sorry.

1018
01:08:20.195 --> 01:08:20.896
Don't.

1019
01:08:22.297 --> 01:08:24.767

1020
01:08:29.804 --> 01:08:32.541

(birds chirping)

1027
01:09:26.494 --> 01:09:28.564
- [Mark Voiceover] Betty.

1028
01:09:30.031 --> 01:09:32.668
(Mark gasping)

1029
01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:53.822

1033
01:10:26.988 --> 01:10:28.257
Sorry.

1034
01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:29.591
I'm okay.

1035
01:10:29.624 --> 01:10:31.026
I'm okay.

1036
01:10:31.059 --> 01:10:34.329
(both crying)

1037
01:10:34.362 --> 01:10:36.699
- I thought I felt your heart

1038
01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.935
with my hands.

1039
01:10:39.968 --> 01:10:42.538
(both crying)

1040
01:10:47.575 --> 01:10:48.444
- Promise.

1041
01:10:49.911 --> 01:10:50.846
- Okay.

1042
01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:51.713
Okay.

1043
01:10:51.746 --> 01:10:53.048
(both crying)

1044
01:10:53.081 --> 01:10:55.851
(waves crashing)

1045
01:11:31.686 --> 01:11:34.089
- [Mark Voiceover] Should we?

1046
01:11:34.122 --> 01:11:36.024
- [Betty Voiceover] Jump?

1047
01:11:36.057 --> 01:11:37.326
(waves crashing)

1048
01:11:37.359 --> 01:11:39.695
- [Mark Voiceover] Should we?

1049
01:11:40.862 --> 01:11:43.532
- [Betty Voiceover] Maybe.

1050
01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:46.368
(fire crackling)

1051
01:12:49.564 --> 01:12:52.134
(Betty moaning)

1052
01:13:16.858 --> 01:13:18.060
- Take me home.

1053
01:13:22.797 --> 01:13:25.868
(car engine revving)

1054
01:13:33.908 --> 01:13:35.978
- Nothing can be perfect.

1055
01:13:37.879 --> 01:13:39.047
I guess.

1056
01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.151
(car engine revving)

1057
01:13:43.985 --> 01:13:46.922
- [Betty Voiceover] No. it
can't.

1058
01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:50.459
No perfect end to the imperfect
mind.

1059
01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:52.995
imperfect body. imperfect life.

1060
01:13:55.296 --> 01:13:56.465
Makes sense.

1061
01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:03.739
The heart to the arteries.
to capillaries to the brain.

1062
01:14:05.273 --> 01:14:08.977
to the soul. to veins
and back to the heart.

1063
01:14:11.312 --> 01:14:15.551
To arteries. to the
capillaries. to the lungs to.

(dramatic music)

1069
01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:41.543
- Damn it.

1070
01:14:41.576 --> 01:14:43.979

1071
01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:47.816

(gentle music)

1093
01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:50.492
Please.

1094
01:18:52.426 --> 01:18:55.296
I'm not supposed to be here.

1095
01:18:55.329 --> 01:18:57.432
I'm not supposed to be here.

1096
01:18:57.465 --> 01:19:00.068
(Mark crying)

1097
01:19:02.837 --> 01:19:04.039
