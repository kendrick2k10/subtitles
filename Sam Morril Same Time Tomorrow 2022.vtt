[audience cheers]

00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:30.875
How are ya?

10
00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.208
[cheering]

11
00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:34.416
Thank you.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.833
Ooh.

13
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.708
All right. How's it going?

14
00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:45.458
Oh my God.

15
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:47.541
Finally. a shooting in Chicago

16
00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.250
that doesn't involve a teenager.

17
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.708
This is gonna be great.

18
00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:52.625
Uh…

19
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.708
It's good to be here.

20
00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:01.583
The world. Terrible times
we're living in. so. you know.

21
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:05.125
I'll tell you what's a bad job. is cop.
That's a tough job. right?

22
00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:07.375
You got all that power.
but they don't pay you enough.

23
00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:10.833
You got a badge and a gun. but you make
sometimes less than a teacher.

24
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.000
Can you imagine
risking getting shot every day.

25
00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:16.333
and you only make
a little bit more than a cop?

26
00:01:16.916 --> 00:01:18.125
That's just…

27
00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:20.208
[laughter]

28
00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:23.250
The old…

29
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.166
[woman] Woo!

30
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.750
That's. you know…

31
00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:27.833
[cheering and applause]

32
00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:33.000
We call that
"the old switcheroo" in showbiz. That's…

33
00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:34.000
[laughter]

34
00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:36.875
No. cop is tougher than teacher.
You know how I know that?

35
00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.625
There's no substitute cop.

36
00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:40.625
[laughter]

37
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.125
That's not true. White women. But…

38
00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:45.041
All right.

39
00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:47.791
"I'm feeling unsafe."

40
00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.791
"We're gonna need backup here."

41
00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:50.833
[laughter]

42
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:54.875
A friend said. "You know
what's gonna help police brutality

43
00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.291
is these body cams."

44
00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:59.083
I was like. "Sounds like
you've never seen the show <i>Cops</i>."

45
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:00.875
[laughter]

46
00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:02.875
That was the whole show.

47
00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:03.833
[laughter]

48
00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:07.166
That show was basically
police brutality but with sponsors.

49
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.333
[laughter]

50
00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:10.916
Every episode was like.
"That guy's on crack."

51
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.500
"Let's beat the shit out of him."

52
00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:14.750
[laughter]

53
00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.833
"Brought to you by Axe body spray."

54
00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:18.083
[laughter]

55
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:22.375
I went to a couple
of Black Lives Matter protests.

56
00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:26.083
Every protest. for some reason.
has a white guy who climbs a tree.

57
00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.166
[laughter]

58
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.916
I don't know why. but he is up there.

59
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.166
[laughter]

60
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.791
And he's cocky about it.

61
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.125
He's like. "You guys man the streets."

62
00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:38.666
"I'm gonna handle up top."

63
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.125
[laughter]

64
00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:41.916
If you say so.

65
00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:44.166
I hear civil rights leaders. like.

66
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.291
"Weren't this many white guys here
in the '60s."

67
00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:48.583
I'm like. "But did you look up?
'Cause they…"

68
00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:49.833
[laughter]

69
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.208
"They're there.
You gotta look around a little."

70
00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:58.500
I saw a guy in the park.

71
00:02:58.583 --> 00:03:01.583
tall white guy in a T-shirt
that said. "Fuck racism."

72
00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:03.708
And I was like. "Problem solved."

73
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:05.541
[laughter]

74
00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:07.875
All it takes is the shirt.

75
00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:12.541
I was embarrassed I forgot to wear
my "Islamophobes can suck my nut" hoodie.

76
00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:15.375
We could… We could have teamed up.

77
00:03:16.208 --> 00:03:19.583
You gotta wear your obvious beliefs
on your shirt. Everyone knows that.

78
00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:24.333
I'm gonna roll into my friend's birthday
in a shirt that says. "Against baby rape."

79
00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:26.375
[laughter]

80
00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:29.833
My friends are gonna be like.
"Why are you wearing that?"

81
00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:32.875
And I'm gonna be like.
"Are you <i>for</i> baby rape? Because…"

82
00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.750
[laughter]

83
00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:37.166
"…some of us are a little fed up."

84
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.166
[laughter]

85
00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:43.625
I saw an article. It said the movie
<i>Snow White </i>is now problematic.

86
00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:44.708
I was like. "All right."

87
00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:47.875
Look. if a movie is 75-plus years old.

88
00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.083
let's just assume there's a few problems…

89
00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:51.125
[laughter]

90
00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:52.333
…and go about our day.

91
00:03:52.416 --> 00:03:54.541
We don't need a think piece every time.

92
00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:56.791
But I read the article.

93
00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:59.333
and it said.
"Look. the movie is problematic

94
00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:02.291
because. uh. he kisses her
and she's sleeping."

95
00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:03.416
"There's no consent."

96
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.541
I was like. "All right.
but it was a quick kiss

97
00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:06.791
and it saved her life."

98
00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:08.458
-It's not…
-[laughter]

99
00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:11.791
It's not like he's making out with her
while jacking off. and. uh.

100
00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:14.000
the dwarves are filming.

101
00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:15.750
It was pretty tastefully done.

102
00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:17.875
[laughter]

103
00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.791
I don't think that movie
has ever inspired a sexual assault.

104
00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:26.083
I don't think there's a dude in prison
right now. like. "Disney lied."

105
00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:27.916
[laughter]

106
00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:32.500
If you pass out
and get kissed by a prince.

107
00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:35.541
it's not exactly
the worst-case scenario. you know.

108
00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:38.208
I'm not saying it's okay. but that's…

109
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:41.666
If you're unconscious. that is
most likely not who's gonna kiss you.

110
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.750
[laughter]

111
00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:47.291
[laughter continues]

112
00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:49.958
Maybe Prince Andrew.
But normally. you know. it's…

113
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.166
Right? All right.

114
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.416
[laughter and applause]

115
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.041
Is the canceling real anymore?
I don't know.

116
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:03.125
Cut to me in a basement in two years.
like. "It's real. It's…"

117
00:05:03.916 --> 00:05:07.916
"It's very real."
But some of it seems ridiculous.

118
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.750
Look at Dr. Seuss last year.

119
00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:13.458
They were like. "He's canceled."
I was like. "I'm pretty sure he's dead."

120
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:14.583
[laughter]

121
00:05:14.666 --> 00:05:17.291
He's not frantically checking
his Twitter right now.

122
00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:18.208
[laughter]

123
00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:20.416
I saw one that said.
"Dr. Seuss is under fire."

124
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.125
I was like. "He's underground."

125
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:24.458
"He's not with us anymore."

126
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.916
I guess he had some racist stuff
in some lesser-known children's books.

127
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.333
Of course. Tucker Carlson
comes on the news. like.

128
00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:32.833
"They're coming for Seuss."

129
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.583
[laughter]

130
00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:38.500
"It's Seuss today.
It could be any of us tomorrow."

131
00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:39.791
[laughter]

132
00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:42.541
"You need to pick a side
in the Seuss wars."

133
00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:47.291
There were people spending thousands
of dollars on the racist Dr. Seuss books

134
00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:50.291
for I don't know what occasion.
I don't know when you break those out.

135
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:52.833
"Daddy. will you read me <i>Cat in the Hat</i>?"

136
00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:54.875
He's like. "Nah. I got the good shit."

137
00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.041
[laughter]

138
00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:58.833
"We're gonna do
a little <i>Jew in the Zoo</i> tonight." It's…

139
00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:00.916
[laughter and applause]

140
00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:12.750
It's amazing how openly anti-Semitic
some of these politicians will be too.

141
00:06:12.833 --> 00:06:16.083
Like there was that representative
here in Illinois. Mary Miller.

142
00:06:16.166 --> 00:06:19.583
She went viral 'cause she goes.
"Hitler was right about one thing."

143
00:06:19.666 --> 00:06:21.166
"The youth is the future."

144
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.000
I was like. "Yeah. I don't think
you had to quote Hitler there."

145
00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:25.333
[laughter]

146
00:06:26.416 --> 00:06:28.500
"That's a pretty widely held belief."

147
00:06:29.666 --> 00:06:32.541
"There's a Whitney Houston song
you could have mentioned."

148
00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:33.583
[laughter]

149
00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:36.208
"I don't think that was
a <i>Führer</i> exclusive. but…"

150
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:37.833
[laughter]

151
00:06:37.916 --> 00:06:39.250
Like Ted Bundy always said.

152
00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:41.708
it's better to ask for forgiveness
than permission.

153
00:06:41.791 --> 00:06:43.333
[laughter]

154
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.916
Marjorie Taylor Greene
said she went to the Holocaust museum.

155
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.041
I was reading this article.

156
00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:55.291
Knowing her. I thought the next sentence
was gonna be. "I don't buy it." but…

157
00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.125
She went the other way.
She said it was worse than she thought.

158
00:06:59.208 --> 00:07:01.000
Also weird for an adult to be like.

159
00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:05.000
"You guys might not know this.
but the Holocaust was really bad."

160
00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:06.958
[laughter]

161
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:09.375
Then she said.
"It wasn't just Jews in those camps."

162
00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:11.666
And I was like.
"Yeah. but it was our thing."

163
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.666
[laughter]

164
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.083
If you were a non-Jew
in a concentration camp.

165
00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:19.625
I bet you were looking around like.
"Is there someone I can talk to?"

166
00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:21.708
[laughter]

167
00:07:23.916 --> 00:07:26.083
"I think a mistake has been made."

168
00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:27.333
[laughter]

169
00:07:27.416 --> 00:07:30.041
Everyone around is complaining.
You're like. "You have it bad?"

170
00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:31.875
"I'm not even supposed to be here."

171
00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.333
[laughter]

172
00:07:34.333 --> 00:07:36.833
"Surely there's a manager I can speak to."

173
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.875
"I know I sound like
one of them. I'm not."

174
00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.125
[laughter]

175
00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.708
She said Jehovah's Witnesses
were in the concentration camps.

176
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:48.250
Isn't it crazy there was a time

177
00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:51.416
where people would knock on <i>their </i>door
and they were like. "Shit."

178
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.875
[laughter and applause]

179
00:07:55.833 --> 00:07:57.750
Yeah. Water break.

180
00:07:57.833 --> 00:07:59.166
[cheering]

181
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.208
I earned it.

182
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:02.291
[applause]

183
00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:06.000
I watch too many
of those Holocaust documentaries.

184
00:08:06.083 --> 00:08:09.041
and. uh. I was watching one.
they had this awful Nazi.

185
00:08:09.125 --> 00:08:10.750
They named him "Ivan the Terrible."

186
00:08:10.833 --> 00:08:13.750
One of the worst human beings ever.
Gassed more Jews than anyone.

187
00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:16.166
Escaped. He's living in Ohio
with a family.

188
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.666
People swore his innocence.

189
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.125
They were like.
"He's never gotten a speeding ticket."

190
00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.375
I was like. "It's him."

191
00:08:21.458 --> 00:08:22.291
[laughter]

192
00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:24.958
If you're a war criminal
trying to keep a low profile.

193
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:27.541
you're gonna be very careful
at every intersection.

194
00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:29.750
I used to hate reckless drivers.

195
00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:31.750
Now I see someone
going seven or eight below.

196
00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:34.250
like. "You fucking Nazi pig."

197
00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:36.166
[laughter]

198
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.000
"What are you hiding from?"

199
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.083
Been on the road a lot.
traveling every week.

200
00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:46.125
I was going through security recently
at the airport in New York.

201
00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:48.416
They have a giant sign
as you're going through security

202
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.041
that just said. "9/11."

203
00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:51.958
"Never forget."

204
00:08:52.708 --> 00:08:55.416
I was like. "I can't forget
before I board the flight?"

205
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.500
[laughter]

206
00:08:59.458 --> 00:09:01.583
"You can't give me
three and a half. four hours

207
00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.291
of maybe blocking that one out?"

208
00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:04.458
[laughter]

209
00:09:04.541 --> 00:09:06.666
We're one step away
from the pilot coming on.

210
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.416
"Hey. this is your captain.
Uh. it could happen again. guys."

211
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.041
[laughter]

212
00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:13.458
"We're due."

213
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.541
"Keep your head on a swivel

214
00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:19.875
'cause I've got a bad feeling
about today for some reason."

215
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.916
I've been traveling every week.
on the road.

216
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.541
I'm with my friend Gary a lot.

217
00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:30.166
and. uh. you know.
we're leaving Columbus. Ohio. recently…

218
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.875
You ever behind someone in line and you're
like. "That's my least favorite person

219
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:36.125
in quite some time"?

220
00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:40.625
And this woman
is just berating TSA. Just awful.

221
00:09:40.708 --> 00:09:42.833
Yelling at this poor woman just nonstop.

222
00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:46.916
Like. "Wow. you're so bad at this.
What's your name? I'm gonna report you."

223
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.625
Two minutes of just awfulness.
just nonstop.

224
00:09:49.708 --> 00:09:52.583
Then. at the two-minute mark.
she goes. "You're an idiot."

225
00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:55.625
That's when I was like. "Lady. enough."

226
00:09:55.708 --> 00:09:58.583
She goes. "This doesn't concern you."
I said. "It didn't."

227
00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:00.041
"Now it does."

228
00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:01.625
[laughter]

229
00:10:01.708 --> 00:10:04.833
I said it pretty cool. so I looked
to see if anyone was paying attention.

230
00:10:04.916 --> 00:10:06.333
No one gave a shit. but…

231
00:10:06.416 --> 00:10:08.625
[laughter]

232
00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:12.291
After I say that.
she loudly yells "Security" on me.

233
00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:14.875
I was like. "They hate you.
They're not gonna do anything."

234
00:10:15.666 --> 00:10:19.125
My friend Gary goes. "Yeah. lady.
this isn't the movie of your life."

235
00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:20.458
"You're a nobody."

236
00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:23.125
[laughter]

237
00:10:23.208 --> 00:10:26.375
She looks at my friend Gary.
and she goes. "Well. you're short."

238
00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:28.000
[laughter]

239
00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:31.416
And I'm… I'm excited
for what Gary's gonna hit her back with.

240
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.458
'Cause he's a funny dude.
I'm oozing with anticipation.

241
00:10:34.541 --> 00:10:36.791
I'm like. "How's he gonna get her?"
I can't wait.

242
00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:40.208
And that's when Gary says.
"You should see me without my shirt on."

243
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:42.250
[laughter]

244
00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:46.916
"Dude. what the hell?
We had her. What are you doing?"

245
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.916
[laughter]

246
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.416
"She was on the ropes."

247
00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:51.625
"You blew it."

248
00:10:52.416 --> 00:10:54.583
And he's my friend.
I have to have his back.

249
00:10:54.666 --> 00:10:57.583
So I was like. "He does look good
without his shirt on."

250
00:10:57.666 --> 00:10:59.250
[laughter]

251
00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:02.166
"He does a lot of… A lot of push-ups and…"

252
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.250
-[laughter]
-You know.

253
00:11:04.333 --> 00:11:06.666
We went from. like.
two badass dudes seeking justice

254
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.416
to just a sad-looking gay couple.

255
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.958
[laughter]

256
00:11:10.041 --> 00:11:13.416
It was like. "Don't you ever
disparage my Gary. He's…"

257
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.000
[laughter]

258
00:11:18.875 --> 00:11:21.750
Traveling. seeing the country.
it's crazy to me. you know.

259
00:11:21.833 --> 00:11:23.791
all the abortion stuff. as a New Yorker.

260
00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:26.333
Most of my friends are pretty progressive.

261
00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:30.666
A friend goes. "I think a woman
should be able to get 12. 13 abortions."

262
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.125
I was like.
"That's a pretty horrifying number."

263
00:11:33.208 --> 00:11:34.291
[laughter]

264
00:11:34.375 --> 00:11:37.750
"I'm for a woman's right to choose.
Maybe don't open with a baker's dozen."

265
00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:38.833
"What do you think?"

266
00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:42.083
"Might not be the path to unity."

267
00:11:42.166 --> 00:11:43.666
[laughter]

268
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.916
Once you've killed enough fetuses
that they could have formed a band…

269
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.125
[laughter]

270
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.541
Ironically also called the Grateful Dead.

271
00:11:50.625 --> 00:11:52.541
-That's…
-[audience gasps]

272
00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:56.791
[cheering and applause]

273
00:11:56.875 --> 00:11:58.375
That's… All right.

274
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.583
Are you into that stuff?
I saw you react there.

275
00:12:02.708 --> 00:12:05.625
A little bit? Yeah?
What kind of work are you in?

276
00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:08.250
I work. uh… I make. uh. staircases.

277
00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:10.625
-You make staircases?
-[laughter]

278
00:12:10.708 --> 00:12:12.916
Well. if the abortion thing
keeps going south.

279
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.708
I'll give you a call. but…

280
00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:16.791
[laughter]

281
00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:21.625
[Sam chuckles]

282
00:12:25.666 --> 00:12:28.791
But. no. it's weird. You watch the news.
and you're like. "Oh. wait."

283
00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:30.208
I saw the news the other day.

284
00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:33.583
You can no longer perform an abortion
in Kentucky or Utah.

285
00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:35.875
"Perform" is what they say.
Weird. you know.

286
00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:39.375
We've all heard it in that context.
It never quite sounds right.

287
00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:40.750
"Perform an abortion."

288
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.875
That sounds like the doctor's
walking into the room. like.

289
00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.000
"Showtime."

290
00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:47.083
[laughter]

291
00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:49.708
"You ladies ready to rock? Let's do this."

292
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.791
Think he's coming home and his wife
is like. "How were your performances?"

293
00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:56.583
And he's like. "I fucking killed."

294
00:12:56.666 --> 00:12:58.666
[laughter]

295
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.875
"Murderer."

296
00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.750
[laughter]

297
00:13:08.458 --> 00:13:10.375
Maybe I'll call this next special. uh.

298
00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:12.083
<i>9/11 Abortion Holocaust.</i>

299
00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.083
What do you think?

300
00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:14.958
[laughter]

301
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:16.500
No one's gonna complain.

302
00:13:16.583 --> 00:13:17.541
[laughter]

303
00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:20.125
You're not gonna see write-ups like.
"I expected better

304
00:13:20.208 --> 00:13:22.333
from <i>9/11 Abortion Holocaust."</i>

305
00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:23.500
[laughter]

306
00:13:24.791 --> 00:13:27.375
"It turned out to lack taste.
and that was…"

307
00:13:28.041 --> 00:13:29.250
"That was surprising."

308
00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:32.625
My favorite people.

309
00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:36.458
Ever talk to someone. they're progressive.
but they don't have the lingo down?

310
00:13:36.541 --> 00:13:37.500
Those are the best.

311
00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:40.375
I was talking to a guy
about a trans person we both know.

312
00:13:40.458 --> 00:13:42.625
He goes. "I fully support it.
I'll play along."

313
00:13:42.708 --> 00:13:44.958
I was like. "I don't think
that's what they're going for."

314
00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:46.708
[laughter]

315
00:13:46.791 --> 00:13:50.166
I don't think you're scoring a lot
of points. walking up to a trans person.

316
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.083
"Sure."

317
00:13:51.166 --> 00:13:53.000
[laughter]

318
00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:54.375
"If you say so."

319
00:13:54.458 --> 00:13:55.666
[laughter]

320
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.708
"Honey. come here. This one's believable.
This is crazy."

321
00:13:58.791 --> 00:14:00.791
[laughter]

322
00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:05.666
He was mad about the trans swimmer.
Lia Thomas. who kept winning races.

323
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.583
He said. "This is messed up. man."

324
00:14:07.666 --> 00:14:10.291
"There needs to be an asterisk
next to those wins."

325
00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:12.083
I said. "Bullshit." He goes. "Exactly."

326
00:14:12.166 --> 00:14:14.416
I said. "No. that you care
about women's swimming."

327
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.958
[laughter]

328
00:14:16.041 --> 00:14:19.375
"I've known you for quite some time.
I've never heard you mention it."

329
00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:24.000
"This outrage rings insincere."
And he said. "What if I have a daughter?"

330
00:14:24.083 --> 00:14:25.291
And I said. "You won't."

331
00:14:25.375 --> 00:14:26.708
[laughter]

332
00:14:26.791 --> 00:14:30.416
"You're 55 and you have a roommate.
I don't think it's gonna happen for ya."

333
00:14:31.625 --> 00:14:34.875
He said. "What if I raise a girl
who turns out to be a swimming champion?"

334
00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:38.041
I said. "If you find someone dumb enough
to let you come inside her.

335
00:14:38.708 --> 00:14:42.625
I can pretty much guarantee that kid
is not gonna grow up to be a winner."

336
00:14:42.708 --> 00:14:43.750
[laughter]

337
00:14:43.833 --> 00:14:46.291
He said. "It could happen.
I never wear condoms."

338
00:14:46.375 --> 00:14:49.250
I said. "You never wear condoms
and you don't have a kid?"

339
00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:52.625
"Too bad your sperm isn't a trans woman.
It would know how to swim."

340
00:14:52.708 --> 00:14:54.708
[laughter and applause]

341
00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:02.041
All right.

342
00:15:03.541 --> 00:15:04.666
I deserve a sip.

343
00:15:06.708 --> 00:15:07.541
All right.

344
00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:12.000
Chappelle caught some shit
for the trans stuff. right?

345
00:15:12.083 --> 00:15:14.250
People were mad at Chappelle and. uh…

346
00:15:14.333 --> 00:15:17.666
My friends were so worried about him.
Like. "They're coming for Dave."

347
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.666
I was like. "He's gonna be okay. I think."

348
00:15:20.375 --> 00:15:22.666
It's always my friend
with the worst possible life

349
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.500
that's the most concerned
about a millionaire celebrity.

350
00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:30.208
My friend's. "They're coming for Dave."
I'm like. "Focus on your shitty life."

351
00:15:30.833 --> 00:15:32.041
"Dave is doing great."

352
00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:36.958
"He flies private. he performs in arenas.
and he makes 24 million a special."

353
00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:40.041
"You borrowed money
from your mother recently. Focus on you."

354
00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:41.291
[laughter]

355
00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:45.333
Dave's not canceled. Know how you'll know
if Dave Chappelle is canceled?

356
00:15:45.416 --> 00:15:47.875
If he does a weekend here.
That's how you'll know.

357
00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.291
[laughter]

358
00:15:51.708 --> 00:15:55.166
If you see Chappelle
live at the Den in Chicago. I'll be like.

359
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.333
"They fucking got him. dude."

360
00:15:57.416 --> 00:15:59.416
[laughter]

361
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.500
[applause]

362
00:16:05.083 --> 00:16:06.291
It's good you came out.

363
00:16:06.375 --> 00:16:08.791
It's good to stay off
the social media. It's poison.

364
00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:11.291
I mean. I'm on it.
but it's not good and. uh…

365
00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:15.333
TikTok is crack.
That stuff. it's not good for you.

366
00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:18.500
You know when you put down a book.
and you're like. "Ah"?

367
00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:21.500
Whenever I get off TikTok.
it's the exact opposite feeling.

368
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.083
I'm on there for 20 minutes.
and I'm like. "What just happened?"

369
00:16:25.166 --> 00:16:26.208
[laughter]

370
00:16:26.291 --> 00:16:27.416
"That wasn't good."

371
00:16:28.125 --> 00:16:31.250
They get this algorithm that's for you.
so it hooks you.

372
00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:33.416
Whatever you like. it keeps you on.

373
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.166
Apparently. what I like is.
uh. men eating sandwiches. That's…

374
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.458
[laughter]

375
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:39.708
That's what I like.

376
00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:43.125
They just… Usually in a car of some sort.

377
00:16:44.166 --> 00:16:45.916
They often rate the sandwich.

378
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.666
I get a lot of dudes in a car. like.

379
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:52.000
"We're gonna see if Wendy's fast food
is overrated or underrated."

380
00:16:52.083 --> 00:16:52.916
Then you watch them.

381
00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958
[laughter]

382
00:16:59.041 --> 00:17:00.625
"Properly rated." I'm like…

383
00:17:00.708 --> 00:17:02.250
[laughter]

384
00:17:02.333 --> 00:17:03.583
"That's all he does?"

385
00:17:04.708 --> 00:17:06.625
"Nineteen million views?"

386
00:17:07.458 --> 00:17:10.791
"I'm working pretty hard
on my act over here. Who's watching this?"

387
00:17:11.333 --> 00:17:13.500
Then he's like. "Next up. Domino's."

388
00:17:13.583 --> 00:17:16.208
And I'm like.
"I do wanna see how it's rated."

389
00:17:16.291 --> 00:17:17.333
[laughter]

390
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.875
I understand the appeal.

391
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.583
[chuckles] TikTok. Facebook.
and. you know… Oh. Meta.

392
00:17:25.666 --> 00:17:28.125
I'm sorry. They're Meta now. They changed.

393
00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:30.541
We're supposed to forget

394
00:17:30.625 --> 00:17:33.083
all the horrible things
they've done to all of us.

395
00:17:33.166 --> 00:17:36.000
The stealing our data.
They're like. "We're Meta. That was…"

396
00:17:36.083 --> 00:17:38.000
"That wasn't us. We're Meta now."

397
00:17:38.083 --> 00:17:40.375
It's like if Bill Cosby
was like. "Call me William."

398
00:17:40.458 --> 00:17:41.333
"I'm actually…"

399
00:17:41.416 --> 00:17:43.500
[laughter and applause]

400
00:17:43.583 --> 00:17:44.583
"Yeah. you can…"

401
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.833
"You can trust me."

402
00:17:47.708 --> 00:17:48.666
"It's William."

403
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:49.791
[laughter]

404
00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:55.500
The Ukraine situation. that's not. uh…
That's not good. That's…

405
00:17:56.666 --> 00:18:01.083
That's my astute take on the matter.
It's. uh… It's not good.

406
00:18:01.166 --> 00:18:02.375
[laughter]

407
00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:06.458
We're giving them weapons.
and Russia knows we're giving them weapons

408
00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:09.291
'cause they can read.
so that's not gonna end well.

409
00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:11.458
It's like your friend's
fighting his girlfriend.

410
00:18:11.541 --> 00:18:14.916
then. very loudly next to them.
you're like. "Call her a bitch. dude."

411
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.333
[laughter]

412
00:18:19.041 --> 00:18:22.083
She's like. "What was that?
You're like. "It's for him. Don't worry."

413
00:18:22.166 --> 00:18:23.416
[laughter]

414
00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:28.166
Not good. our relationship
with the phone and the computer.

415
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.291
I definitely have watched
too much porn in my life. It's not…

416
00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:33.875
It's not great. right?

417
00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:37.541
You notice when you get set up on dates.
This girl goes. "What's your type?"

418
00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:39.458
And I was like. "Uh. busty."

419
00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:41.416
[laughter]

420
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.583
"Mature."

421
00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:46.583
"Neighbor. hand job." She's like. "Hm."

422
00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:47.958
[laughter]

423
00:18:49.875 --> 00:18:52.583
"Sorry. forgot you weren't
a search engine. That was…"

424
00:18:53.916 --> 00:18:57.041
They have weird porn now too.
Angry women. that's a category.

425
00:18:57.875 --> 00:18:59.333
Angry women porn.

426
00:19:00.083 --> 00:19:03.250
I don't know if you've seen it.
The woman's like. "You piece of shit."

427
00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:06.000
"You're… Oh. you're so shitty."

428
00:19:06.708 --> 00:19:09.250
I guess people
are turned on by this. I don't…

429
00:19:09.333 --> 00:19:11.666
I guess. if that's your thing.
that's the best porn

430
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.708
to get caught watching by your partner.

431
00:19:14.208 --> 00:19:17.750
She just walks in. like. "What the fuck?"
And you're like. "Yes."

432
00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:19.166
[laughter]

433
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.375
"Yes."

434
00:19:21.458 --> 00:19:23.666
[applause]

435
00:19:24.541 --> 00:19:27.291
This actor said he was battling
a porn addiction.

436
00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:30.750
I was like. "'Battling'?
That's a… That's a bit dramatic. huh?"

437
00:19:31.791 --> 00:19:36.833
What's that? Sounds like he's just sitting
at the keyboard. like. "Argh!"

438
00:19:36.916 --> 00:19:38.083
[laughter]

439
00:19:38.166 --> 00:19:39.083
"Argh!"

440
00:19:40.791 --> 00:19:42.375
"We won another battle today."

441
00:19:42.458 --> 00:19:43.875
[laughter]

442
00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:45.833
"But who knows what tomorrow holds?"

443
00:19:48.791 --> 00:19:52.416
I never feel good after I watch it.
Every time I watch porn. I'm like. "Ugh."

444
00:19:52.916 --> 00:19:54.000
"Same time tomorrow."

445
00:19:54.083 --> 00:19:55.041
"But that was…"

446
00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:55.958
[laughter]

447
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:57.250
"…just disgusting."

448
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.541
I don't feel represented in these films.

449
00:20:01.125 --> 00:20:04.250
I've never seen one where the guy is.
90 seconds in. "I'm gonna come."

450
00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:06.458
and then the woman is like. "That's okay."

451
00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:08.583
[laughter]

452
00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:12.375
Then he's like. "Let me lay here a second.
I had pad Thai for lunch. so…"

453
00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:13.875
[laughter]

454
00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:17.041
Specific genre.

455
00:20:17.125 --> 00:20:18.750
[laughter]

456
00:20:20.166 --> 00:20:21.583
What do you guys think?

457
00:20:21.666 --> 00:20:24.666
One-night-stand sex or relationship sex?
What's the preference?

458
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.875
[man] One night.

459
00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:27.500
One night? Who said that?

460
00:20:27.583 --> 00:20:29.541
Right there. Why do you prefer it. sir?

461
00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:33.000
-[man] Easy. No attachments.
-No attachment. all right.

462
00:20:33.083 --> 00:20:35.833
I could have guessed
by the backwards cap. I suppose.

463
00:20:35.916 --> 00:20:36.833
That's. uh…

464
00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:38.833
[Sam chuckles]

465
00:20:39.833 --> 00:20:41.250
"This fuckin' hat."

466
00:20:41.333 --> 00:20:42.708
[laughter]

467
00:20:42.791 --> 00:20:43.791
"I love it."

468
00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:47.500
[chuckles] And that's a…
That's a loud jacket. What is that jacket?

469
00:20:47.583 --> 00:20:49.083
My buddy gave me it. I like it.

470
00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:50.583
Your buddy gave you a…

471
00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:53.375
[laughter]

472
00:20:53.458 --> 00:20:54.333
That's a…

473
00:20:55.541 --> 00:20:57.208
That's an interesting friendship.

474
00:20:57.291 --> 00:20:58.291
[laughter]

475
00:20:59.041 --> 00:21:01.375
Are these your friends.
or you don't know them?

476
00:21:01.458 --> 00:21:04.000
Nah. these are just
some guys we met tonight.

477
00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:05.208
Oh. all right.

478
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:07.125
You play your cards right. you can get…

479
00:21:07.625 --> 00:21:08.875
You might get another jacket.

480
00:21:09.375 --> 00:21:12.375
You know. that's… two jackets.

481
00:21:12.458 --> 00:21:14.666
[applause]

482
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.916
[Sam chuckles]

483
00:21:16.666 --> 00:21:19.875
That's… No. it's tough.
Single is tough. It's tough to. you know…

484
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.083
I like relationship sex.

485
00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:24.583
because when you finish.
you're like. "Oh. good."

486
00:21:25.208 --> 00:21:27.041
[laughter]

487
00:21:27.125 --> 00:21:31.041
Isn't that crazy.
to come and not be miserable?

488
00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:33.125
[laughter]

489
00:21:34.291 --> 00:21:35.958
Every time I come.

490
00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:39.125
I get that post-nut clarity.
like. "What have I done?"

491
00:21:39.208 --> 00:21:40.458
[laughter]

492
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:43.291
You think that happens to pedophiles?
You think. uh…

493
00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:44.958
-[audience gasps]
-All right.

494
00:21:45.041 --> 00:21:46.333
[audience groans]

495
00:21:46.416 --> 00:21:47.541
[Sam chuckles]

496
00:21:47.625 --> 00:21:51.791
You think pedos nut. and they're like.
"Just take the candy and go. I really…"

497
00:21:53.458 --> 00:21:54.833
"I really messed up."

498
00:21:54.916 --> 00:21:56.916
[applause]

499
00:21:58.208 --> 00:22:00.125
"Same time tomorrow." But…

500
00:22:00.208 --> 00:22:01.416
[laughter]

501
00:22:03.125 --> 00:22:05.000
Here's what I like about pedophiles.

502
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:08.291
They never complain about my comedy.

503
00:22:08.375 --> 00:22:09.666
[laughter]

504
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.875
A lot of groups. they get easily offended.

505
00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:14.708
I've noticed that pedos
tend to stay silent.

506
00:22:14.791 --> 00:22:16.000
[laughter]

507
00:22:16.083 --> 00:22:17.125
Isn't that cool?

508
00:22:18.333 --> 00:22:21.958
I've taken a lot of shots in my day.
I've never had one stand up at a show.

509
00:22:22.041 --> 00:22:22.875
"Enough."

510
00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:24.875
[laughter]

511
00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:26.791
"You crossed the line tonight. sir."

512
00:22:26.875 --> 00:22:28.791
[laughter]

513
00:22:29.708 --> 00:22:32.541
I got my hair cut a few weeks ago.
There's a kid next to me.

514
00:22:32.625 --> 00:22:36.333
When the barber was done. he goes.
"Look at you. What a handsome boy."

515
00:22:36.416 --> 00:22:39.625
That was acceptable he said that.
but it did get weird when I chimed in.

516
00:22:39.708 --> 00:22:40.833
"Hell yeah. he is."

517
00:22:40.916 --> 00:22:42.916
[laughter]

518
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.250
Maybe it's 'cause of his job
it's okay he said it.

519
00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:50.208
Maybe I made it weird
'cause I licked my lips. We'll never know.

520
00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:51.208
[laughter]

521
00:22:51.291 --> 00:22:53.916
No. certain jobs.
you can compliment a kid's appearance.

522
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.625
-Priest is not one of them. You can't…
-[laughter]

523
00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:58.166
They lost their privileges.

524
00:22:59.125 --> 00:23:01.625
The Catholic Church.
they're like Amazon. you know.

525
00:23:01.708 --> 00:23:03.250
They're too big to be stopped.

526
00:23:04.083 --> 00:23:07.083
they don't pay any taxes.
and they fuck the little guy. and…

527
00:23:07.166 --> 00:23:09.166
[laughter]

528
00:23:10.166 --> 00:23:11.041
[cheering]

529
00:23:11.125 --> 00:23:11.958
But…

530
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:14.041
[cheering and applause]

531
00:23:16.375 --> 00:23:18.750
Rabbis do it too.
I don't wanna just pick on priests.

532
00:23:18.833 --> 00:23:20.541
Rabbis do it as well.

533
00:23:20.625 --> 00:23:22.875
Not as much as priests.
No one can touch those numbers.

534
00:23:22.958 --> 00:23:24.041
But they're up there.

535
00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:25.000
[laughter]

536
00:23:25.083 --> 00:23:26.375
Slightly less.

537
00:23:26.458 --> 00:23:29.416
You wanna hear my theory
why rabbis do it slightly less. as a Jew?

538
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.416
Jewish kids can be pretty annoying.

539
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.708
[laughter]

540
00:23:33.458 --> 00:23:35.125
No one wants to molest a seven-year-old

541
00:23:35.208 --> 00:23:37.708
who's like. "Do I have to get on my knees?
They're pretty achy."

542
00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:40.000
-You know. like. "Oh my God."
-[laughter]

543
00:23:40.083 --> 00:23:44.541
"And my allergies."
You're like. "Oh my God. this is brutal."

544
00:23:47.458 --> 00:23:48.875
[stomping]

545
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.916
[Sam chuckles]

546
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
I think a priest just left. But…

547
00:23:54.583 --> 00:23:55.791
I don't know.

548
00:23:55.875 --> 00:23:57.875
[applause]

549
00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:03.791
[Sam chuckles]

550
00:24:04.583 --> 00:24:07.083
My type is. uh. depressed women.

551
00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.125
My friend was like. "You like that?"
I said. "No.

552
00:24:11.208 --> 00:24:13.333
but that's who keep showing up."
So that's…

553
00:24:13.416 --> 00:24:14.333
[laughter]

554
00:24:14.416 --> 00:24:15.416
Time to own it.

555
00:24:16.458 --> 00:24:20.333
There's something about depressed women.
I always assume they have more depth.

556
00:24:21.583 --> 00:24:24.791
'Cause she's so sad.
I'm like. "She must feel deeply."

557
00:24:24.875 --> 00:24:28.000
Then we hang out. and I'm like.
"Nah. just a bummer. You're just a…"

558
00:24:28.083 --> 00:24:29.208
[laughter]

559
00:24:31.083 --> 00:24:32.083
"Just a bummer."

560
00:24:32.166 --> 00:24:35.041
I get turned on. I'm like. "How are you?"
She's like. "Terrible."

561
00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:37.875
"This chick gets it. dude. She just…"

562
00:24:38.708 --> 00:24:41.208
"She sees through
the bullshit that is life."

563
00:24:41.291 --> 00:24:42.125
[laughter]

564
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.083
Depression. it's tough.

565
00:24:47.166 --> 00:24:49.500
I told my mom I was depressed once.
and she goes.

566
00:24:49.583 --> 00:24:50.791
"But you're so tall."

567
00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:54.083
[laughter]

568
00:24:55.083 --> 00:24:57.291
I don't know what that means.
It's like. if I hang myself.

569
00:24:57.375 --> 00:24:59.125
my feet are gonna touch the ground.

570
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.916
I mean. I am tall.

571
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.333
[laughter]

572
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.833
-I'm in therapy. obviously.
-[audience member] Woo!

573
00:25:08.916 --> 00:25:12.041
Thank you. I'll take that. Why not?
You know what therapy's taught me?

574
00:25:12.125 --> 00:25:14.958
If a woman tells me she's upset with me.
to say. "I understand."

575
00:25:15.458 --> 00:25:16.958
Instead of. uh. "Here we go."

576
00:25:17.041 --> 00:25:18.916
[laughter]

577
00:25:20.375 --> 00:25:21.625
They don't like that one.

578
00:25:22.416 --> 00:25:24.541
Drinking's good too.
I do drinking and therapy.

579
00:25:24.625 --> 00:25:25.916
It's a good balance.

580
00:25:26.666 --> 00:25:29.916
Bartenders are basically therapists.
They listen. they take your money.

581
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.166
Sometimes they even tell you
when it's time to go.

582
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:33.291
[laughter]

583
00:25:33.375 --> 00:25:36.625
A bartender will give you a free round
every once in a while.

584
00:25:36.708 --> 00:25:39.250
-I've never met a therapist that cool.
-[laughter]

585
00:25:39.333 --> 00:25:42.333
Very few therapists are like.
"Oh. you were molested?"

586
00:25:42.416 --> 00:25:43.791
"This shit's on the house."

587
00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.875
[laughter]

588
00:25:46.791 --> 00:25:47.958
"You earned it. buddy."

589
00:25:48.041 --> 00:25:49.125
[laughter]

590
00:25:50.166 --> 00:25:52.416
What's important
in a relationship? Movies.

591
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.250
I'm a big movie guy.
I love watching movies.

592
00:25:55.333 --> 00:25:58.500
Ever show someone one of your favorite
movies and they don't pay full attention?

593
00:25:58.583 --> 00:26:01.041
Makes me crazy. I know. it's brutal.

594
00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:05.125
I showed my ex one of my favorite movies.
seven minutes in. she tries to have sex.

595
00:26:05.208 --> 00:26:07.916
-I was like. "What are you doing?"
-[laughter]

596
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.916
She goes. "You're not gonna have sex?"

597
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.250
I said. "I'll fuck you
during a movie you pick."

598
00:26:12.333 --> 00:26:14.208
[laughter]

599
00:26:14.291 --> 00:26:16.458
"I don't wanna have sex
during <i>Dog Day Afternoon."</i>

600
00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:17.875
<i>"</i>It's in my top five."

601
00:26:17.958 --> 00:26:18.875
[laughter]

602
00:26:18.958 --> 00:26:22.500
"I'll totally bang you
during <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> 2005 or…"

603
00:26:22.583 --> 00:26:24.666
-[woman] Oh!
-Yeah. yeah. I said it.

604
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.375
[laughter]

605
00:26:26.458 --> 00:26:29.166
"Is there a Jane Austen adaptation
you wanna watch? Throw it on."

606
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.083
"I'll be rock hard and ready to go."

607
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:33.166
"And I'm doing it for you."

608
00:26:35.625 --> 00:26:38.791
I have more confidence in my movie taste
than my sexual ability.

609
00:26:39.875 --> 00:26:41.166
I can defend the movie.

610
00:26:41.916 --> 00:26:44.083
[laughter]

611
00:26:44.166 --> 00:26:48.250
If I fuck you and you're disappointed.
I can't be like. "You just didn't get it."

612
00:26:48.333 --> 00:26:50.375
[laughter]

613
00:26:50.458 --> 00:26:51.875
"It was ahead of its time."

614
00:26:51.958 --> 00:26:53.708
[laughter]

615
00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:57.291
Did you do that to him?
I saw you react. What… What movie was it?

616
00:26:57.375 --> 00:26:58.583
[laughter]

617
00:26:58.666 --> 00:27:00.291
What movie are we talking?

618
00:27:00.375 --> 00:27:01.791
[woman] <i>Fantastic Beasts.</i>

619
00:27:01.875 --> 00:27:03.291
<i>Fantastic Beasts?</i>

620
00:27:04.083 --> 00:27:06.000
I don't even know what that is.
What is it?

621
00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:07.333
It's Harry Potter.

622
00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:10.250
Oh. Harry Potter.
Yeah. I got laid in high school. Uh…

623
00:27:10.333 --> 00:27:11.708
-[laughter]
-[Sam] Sorry. I…

624
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:13.791
[laughter and applause]

625
00:27:16.666 --> 00:27:19.333
How many of these superhero movies
are they gonna make?

626
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.375
Ever see a trailer where you can't tell
if it's a superhero origin story

627
00:27:23.458 --> 00:27:24.916
or about a special needs kid?

628
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.583
[laughter]

629
00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:29.666
Some guy comes on. "Your son is…

630
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.583
different."

631
00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:31.750
[laughter]

632
00:27:31.833 --> 00:27:34.791
Is he gonna save the city.
or is he really good at math?

633
00:27:34.875 --> 00:27:35.875
[laughter]

634
00:27:36.666 --> 00:27:39.208
"Starring Jesse Eisenberg."

635
00:27:39.791 --> 00:27:41.083
I still don't know. I…

636
00:27:41.166 --> 00:27:43.166
[laughter]

637
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.250
"Marvel presents.

638
00:27:45.333 --> 00:27:46.791
<i>Doctor Helmet." </i>Hm?

639
00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:48.875
[laughter]

640
00:27:51.416 --> 00:27:55.333
That joke. uh. bombed five straight shows
in Portland. Oregon. and…

641
00:27:55.416 --> 00:27:56.791
[laughter]

642
00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:59.208
…I thought. "I think
I have to drop this joke."

643
00:28:00.291 --> 00:28:02.291
And then I did it in St. Louis. Missouri.

644
00:28:02.375 --> 00:28:05.125
and I was like.
"I think this is my best joke." This is…

645
00:28:05.208 --> 00:28:06.041
[laughter]

646
00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:07.208
"This is crushing."

647
00:28:09.666 --> 00:28:11.375
[chuckles] You gotta tour.

648
00:28:13.541 --> 00:28:15.291
Hit the different cities. you know?

649
00:28:16.375 --> 00:28:19.083
I hooked up with a mother of six recently.
on the road.

650
00:28:20.291 --> 00:28:23.375
I was in Utah. It was the lowest number
I could find. and. uh…

651
00:28:23.458 --> 00:28:24.958
[laughter]

652
00:28:25.041 --> 00:28:26.125
I… [chuckles]

653
00:28:26.208 --> 00:28:27.833
[cheering and applause]

654
00:28:30.541 --> 00:28:32.000
This is gonna sound filthy here.

655
00:28:32.083 --> 00:28:34.750
but at one point.
she stuck her tongue up my butt.

656
00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:37.791
Her idea.
I would never propose such a thing.

657
00:28:38.625 --> 00:28:41.083
Her phone rang.
It was one of her six kids.

658
00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:43.958
She removed her tongue
to attend to her child.

659
00:28:44.583 --> 00:28:46.708
I was like.
"That's a good mother right there."

660
00:28:47.208 --> 00:28:51.083
Next day. I had to call my mom to check in
and my mom said. "Now is not a good time."

661
00:28:51.166 --> 00:28:53.958
I was like.
"What the fuck are you doing. Mom?"

662
00:28:54.041 --> 00:28:55.375
[laughter]

663
00:28:55.458 --> 00:28:57.458
"What the fuck are you doing?"

664
00:28:58.291 --> 00:29:00.291
[applause]

665
00:29:02.166 --> 00:29:07.083
Shit. no. I've been on those dating apps.
They're fucking crazy. They're terrible.

666
00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:10.916
I saw a woman on there
who just said. uh. first words. "Loyalty."

667
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.750
"Respect."

668
00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:15.208
I was like. "Are you Tony Soprano?
What the hell?"

669
00:29:15.291 --> 00:29:16.333
[laughter]

670
00:29:16.416 --> 00:29:17.875
"Gabagool"? What the…

671
00:29:17.958 --> 00:29:19.875
[laughter]

672
00:29:20.541 --> 00:29:24.291
I scrolled down.
It said. "No misogyny. No homophobia."

673
00:29:24.375 --> 00:29:27.875
So I message her. "Please suck my dick
so I can prove I'm not gay."

674
00:29:27.958 --> 00:29:29.958
[laughter]

675
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.916
My neck is messed up.
I had to. you know. see a doctor.

676
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.583
My neck is killing me.

677
00:29:38.666 --> 00:29:40.000
I got two herniated discs.

678
00:29:40.083 --> 00:29:42.416
I'm sitting on the subway
'cause I'm in pain.

679
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.791
This older lady walks over.

680
00:29:43.875 --> 00:29:46.625
She goes. "In my day.
a man would give his seat to a woman."

681
00:29:46.708 --> 00:29:48.875
I said. "We've come a long way.
haven't we?"

682
00:29:48.958 --> 00:29:50.125
[laughter]

683
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:53.416
"I'm very progressive."

684
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.791
[laughter]

685
00:29:54.875 --> 00:29:58.791
No. I went to the doctor. He said.
"It's C5 and C6. It's pretty bad."

686
00:29:58.875 --> 00:30:00.583
"You gotta get that checked out."

687
00:30:00.666 --> 00:30:04.333
He said. "Yeah. no going down on a woman
for a while 'cause of your neck."

688
00:30:04.416 --> 00:30:06.625
And I was like…
That made me feel kinda cool.

689
00:30:06.708 --> 00:30:07.791
[laughter]

690
00:30:07.875 --> 00:30:10.791
I was like. "Clearly.
that's what brought me in here. Doc."

691
00:30:11.541 --> 00:30:13.500
"I must have OD'd on poontang and…

692
00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:14.833
[laughter]

693
00:30:14.916 --> 00:30:16.750
…messed up the old spine."

694
00:30:16.833 --> 00:30:17.791
[laughter]

695
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.041
A woman will ask me to go down on her.

696
00:30:20.125 --> 00:30:23.125
I say. "I will not. I have a doctor's note
from Mount Sinai."

697
00:30:23.208 --> 00:30:24.083
[laughter]

698
00:30:24.166 --> 00:30:25.000
"Sorry."

699
00:30:25.875 --> 00:30:26.958
[man] Michael Douglas.

700
00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:30.916
Michael Douglas. yeah. What do you think?
You think that's real?

701
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.375
No. I mean. he got cancer.

702
00:30:32.458 --> 00:30:35.416
-[Sam] He blamed Catherine Zeta-Jones.
-Yeah.

703
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.583
That's fucking weird.

704
00:30:36.666 --> 00:30:37.583
[laughter]

705
00:30:37.666 --> 00:30:38.666
Isn't it?

706
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.833
-That's how my dad got cancer.
-[Sam] How your dad got cancer?

707
00:30:41.916 --> 00:30:44.291
He ate out Catherine Zeta-Jones?
That's crazy.

708
00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:46.250
[laughter and applause]

709
00:30:46.333 --> 00:30:47.291
That's nutty.

710
00:30:49.125 --> 00:30:51.708
-[man] Same type.
-Same type. Is he all right?

711
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:52.958
Well. he died.

712
00:30:53.041 --> 00:30:54.583
[Sam] Oh. jeez.

713
00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:56.708
I love… I love eating pussy. though.

714
00:30:56.791 --> 00:30:58.458
You love eating pussy?

715
00:30:58.541 --> 00:31:01.625
[chuckles] Maybe you didn't say that
at the funeral. I hope.

716
00:31:01.708 --> 00:31:02.625
[laughter]

717
00:31:02.708 --> 00:31:06.416
He's like. "Look. I miss my dad.
but cunnilingus is the shit. so…"

718
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.166
[laughter]

719
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.458
I didn't know yet.

720
00:31:09.541 --> 00:31:10.958
-[Sam] You didn't know?
-I was 13.

721
00:31:11.041 --> 00:31:13.625
[Sam] That's a weird thing
to be told. I guess.

722
00:31:13.708 --> 00:31:15.750
"Your dad's dying." "What happened?"

723
00:31:15.833 --> 00:31:17.833
"He was a beaver man. I don't know."

724
00:31:18.458 --> 00:31:19.416
"He…"

725
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:25.166
[chuckles] For some reason. they wrote.
"Can't stop. won't stop" on his tombstone.

726
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.250
[laughter]

727
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.291
I mean. wow.

728
00:31:29.375 --> 00:31:30.583
What are you drinking?

729
00:31:31.375 --> 00:31:33.500
A Modelo and a tequila soda.

730
00:31:33.583 --> 00:31:35.166
[Sam] You're doubling it?

731
00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.875
Well. I got two drinks 'cause the--

732
00:31:36.958 --> 00:31:39.375
[Sam] Two drinks.
No. I know how it works. Let's…

733
00:31:39.458 --> 00:31:40.750
[laughter]

734
00:31:40.833 --> 00:31:43.041
Let this guy…
Let's get him another tequila.

735
00:31:43.916 --> 00:31:46.708
And pour out a Modelo
for his dad who ate a lot of pussy.

736
00:31:47.625 --> 00:31:50.083
-[cheering]
-[Sam] That's… Yeah.

737
00:31:50.666 --> 00:31:53.375
Liquor before beer. you're in the clear.
Beer before liquor…

738
00:31:53.458 --> 00:31:55.666
-[audience] Never been sicker.
-You guys know it.

739
00:31:56.166 --> 00:31:58.708
-Lot of professionals in the house.
-[laughter]

740
00:31:58.791 --> 00:32:01.083
You don't have a problem
if you're doing the rhyme.

741
00:32:01.166 --> 00:32:05.250
I don't think there's anyone out there
like. "Wait. Quaaludes before crack. uh…"

742
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.166
"Never get my kids back? I don't…"

743
00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:10.250
[laughter]

744
00:32:13.041 --> 00:32:15.791
Tequila's a good one.
Is that your drink of choice?

745
00:32:15.875 --> 00:32:16.833
[man] Whiskey.

746
00:32:16.916 --> 00:32:18.208
You're a whiskey guy?

747
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:22.166
Whiskey's my favorite. probably.
but. you know. it's an adventure.

748
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:24.208
Bad shit happens on whiskey.

749
00:32:24.291 --> 00:32:26.916
Wine is my second favorite
'cause it's sloppy.

750
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.541
Worst case. gossip.

751
00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:29.916
[laughter]

752
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.375
Right? What's gonna happen?

753
00:32:31.458 --> 00:32:34.916
I have a few glasses of red wine.
I'll talk shit about someone I love.

754
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.875
[laughter]

755
00:32:35.958 --> 00:32:37.958
Kill a bottle. feel classy.

756
00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.750
I feel like fewer people
are waking up in a dumpster like.

757
00:32:41.833 --> 00:32:43.125
"Pinot again. dude."

758
00:32:43.208 --> 00:32:44.833
[laughter]

759
00:32:44.916 --> 00:32:46.000
"It's a problem."

760
00:32:48.291 --> 00:32:49.458
No. whiskey's good.

761
00:32:49.541 --> 00:32:52.000
Tequila's good. though.
'cause he's doing the soda.

762
00:32:52.083 --> 00:32:53.541
so the hangover's not as bad.

763
00:32:53.625 --> 00:32:56.208
'Cause my body. it's… It's going downhill.

764
00:32:57.083 --> 00:32:58.958
The process has already started.

765
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:03.375
I don't mean to be too crass here.
but my jizz has started to lose its oomph.

766
00:33:03.458 --> 00:33:04.791
[laughter]

767
00:33:04.875 --> 00:33:07.375
It used to shoot out of my penis
like an Avenger.

768
00:33:07.458 --> 00:33:10.666
Now it hobbles out
like a musician on his farewell tour.

769
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.916
[laughter]

770
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.625
I think I went from Iron Man
to Neil Young. What the hell happened?

771
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:18.666
You can almost hear the jizz going.

772
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:22.291
<i>♪ "Old man. take a look at my life.</i>
<i>"It's a lot like you." ♪</i>

773
00:33:22.375 --> 00:33:24.375
[laughter]

774
00:33:25.125 --> 00:33:28.583
It's not on Spotify anymore.
so I thought I'd give you a taste. but…

775
00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:31.125
[Sam chuckles]

776
00:33:36.333 --> 00:33:38.750
No. this is a good city. Chicago. It is.

777
00:33:38.833 --> 00:33:41.958
You're a good time.
and. you know. I can't. uh. drive. so…

778
00:33:42.041 --> 00:33:43.750
[laughter]

779
00:33:44.291 --> 00:33:45.875
This is how New York I am.

780
00:33:45.958 --> 00:33:49.916
I can't drive and I had a gay experience
when I was seven. That's pretty New York.

781
00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:54.291
I kissed a boy. I would have gone further.
but he was a fucking prude.

782
00:33:54.375 --> 00:33:55.666
[laughter]

783
00:33:56.333 --> 00:33:59.875
I was at an all-boys school.
so it was prison gay. but. uh…

784
00:33:59.958 --> 00:34:02.000
[laughter]

785
00:34:02.083 --> 00:34:04.541
When you're a teenager
and your friends ask.

786
00:34:04.625 --> 00:34:07.541
"Who was your first kiss?"
I'd always be like. "I don't remember."

787
00:34:07.625 --> 00:34:08.541
I remember.

788
00:34:08.625 --> 00:34:10.291
[laughter]

789
00:34:10.375 --> 00:34:13.416
A young boy named Charlie
with full lips and a fat ass.

790
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.750
[laughter]

791
00:34:15.833 --> 00:34:17.250
That kid rocked.

792
00:34:17.333 --> 00:34:20.083
[applause]

793
00:34:20.166 --> 00:34:23.416
You do gay stuff at an all-boys school.
You don't even think about it.

794
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.208
I remember. we were 13.
we used to masturbate together.

795
00:34:26.291 --> 00:34:27.916
[quiet laughter]

796
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.208
Yeah. you're not ready for this one.
Chicago. Too bad. It's coming.

797
00:34:31.291 --> 00:34:32.791
[laughter]

798
00:34:32.875 --> 00:34:35.333
We used to…
We used to jack off in a group.

799
00:34:35.833 --> 00:34:36.666
Uh…

800
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.375
-[laughter]
-[man] Yeah!

801
00:34:38.458 --> 00:34:41.708
Yeah. I told this to my friend.
He goes. "I did that too. I was 22."

802
00:34:41.791 --> 00:34:43.625
I was like. "Different thing." But…

803
00:34:43.708 --> 00:34:45.208
[laughter]

804
00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:48.083
No one else who ever did that? No?

805
00:34:48.666 --> 00:34:50.750
-My brother.
-You did it with your brother?

806
00:34:50.833 --> 00:34:51.958
[man] No. no. no. no.

807
00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:55.250
I was… I was at my computer
playing video games.

808
00:34:55.333 --> 00:34:59.208
My brother and his friends
were jacking off to porn on the TV.

809
00:35:00.666 --> 00:35:02.291
Sounds like quite the household.

810
00:35:02.375 --> 00:35:03.541
[laughter]

811
00:35:06.333 --> 00:35:08.000
Your brother… In the same room?

812
00:35:08.708 --> 00:35:10.458
-I'm his dad.
-Yeah.

813
00:35:10.541 --> 00:35:12.541
[laughter]

814
00:35:16.958 --> 00:35:19.166
You're… You're… You're the dad?

815
00:35:19.916 --> 00:35:22.166
Did it get difficult holding the camera?

816
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.250
[laughter]

817
00:35:29.416 --> 00:35:31.166
What were they jerking off to?

818
00:35:32.166 --> 00:35:34.208
[laughter]

819
00:35:35.208 --> 00:35:36.083
It was porn.

820
00:35:37.125 --> 00:35:38.291
That's the stuff.

821
00:35:38.375 --> 00:35:40.375
[laughter]

822
00:35:43.583 --> 00:35:47.333
You know… Yeah. No. I… I…
We were terrible. We were… Four of us.

823
00:35:47.416 --> 00:35:51.000
My friend. Jesse. Short. fat kid.
Enormous cock. And. uh…

824
00:35:51.083 --> 00:35:52.125
[laughter]

825
00:35:52.208 --> 00:35:54.875
So big that when I saw it.
I wasn't even jealous. I was like.

826
00:35:54.958 --> 00:35:55.916
"Hell yeah. dude."

827
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.875
[laughter]

828
00:35:56.958 --> 00:36:00.875
"God is good." That was my reaction
to his… To his penis.

829
00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:02.166
I was like. "Hell yeah."

830
00:36:02.958 --> 00:36:04.500
"Jesse's packing heat."

831
00:36:04.583 --> 00:36:05.916
[laughter]

832
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.708
Not just big for a 13-year-old.

833
00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:11.250
Like. if that thing stayed on track.
he is a problem right now. but…

834
00:36:11.333 --> 00:36:13.541
[laughter]

835
00:36:14.125 --> 00:36:16.458
We'd go to the store.
and the guy would hook it up.

836
00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:19.875
He would just be like.
"Take some free porn. You're good kids."

837
00:36:19.958 --> 00:36:23.708
We'd buy one MILF porn DVD. He'd be like.
"Take some Black and Asian on the house."

838
00:36:23.791 --> 00:36:26.333
We'd be like. "Wow. this is a great guy."

839
00:36:27.083 --> 00:36:29.833
Looking back. he probably
was not a great guy. but…

840
00:36:29.916 --> 00:36:30.833
[laughter]

841
00:36:30.916 --> 00:36:32.625
…he did help. and. uh…

842
00:36:32.708 --> 00:36:34.958
We'd watch porn.
At first. it was just like SportsCenter.

843
00:36:35.041 --> 00:36:36.250
Like. "That was crazy."

844
00:36:36.333 --> 00:36:39.625
Then one day. Jesse. he goes for it.
He just starts masturbating.

845
00:36:39.708 --> 00:36:42.708
We all looked at each other. like.
"What the hell is this guy doing?"

846
00:36:43.208 --> 00:36:46.166
Cut to a week later.
we're passing lotion around the room

847
00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:49.291
like it's a whiskey in the war.

848
00:36:49.375 --> 00:36:51.375
[laughter]

849
00:36:52.583 --> 00:36:55.708
What was he doing? Breaking barriers.
That's what he was doing.

850
00:36:56.583 --> 00:36:57.666
We kept it civilized.

851
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:59.416
We used pillows to shield our penises

852
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.000
to give it the feel of a gentlemen's club.
if you will.

853
00:37:02.083 --> 00:37:03.625
[laughter]

854
00:37:03.708 --> 00:37:05.625
There's always one kid who finishes first.

855
00:37:05.708 --> 00:37:08.416
He's always like. "I'm out."
like it's a game of cards.

856
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.375
[laughter]

857
00:37:09.458 --> 00:37:11.208
Same kid every time.

858
00:37:11.291 --> 00:37:14.000
It was never Jesse.
The bastard had endurance too. but…

859
00:37:14.083 --> 00:37:15.291
[laughter]

860
00:37:15.375 --> 00:37:18.500
This is the point I like to imagine
there's a guy in the crowd on a first date

861
00:37:18.583 --> 00:37:21.833
and he feels the need to turn to her
and go. "This is disgusting."

862
00:37:21.916 --> 00:37:22.750
But…

863
00:37:22.833 --> 00:37:23.958
[laughter]

864
00:37:24.041 --> 00:37:25.708
…deep down. he's got a secret.

865
00:37:25.791 --> 00:37:26.958
[laughter]

866
00:37:27.041 --> 00:37:29.125
Under the table. he texts a group thread.

867
00:37:29.208 --> 00:37:30.458
"Tell no one."

868
00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:32.541
[laughter]

869
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.291
I don't think my friends are gonna say
anything. Two of them. I trust.

870
00:37:37.375 --> 00:37:38.916
and the other one is dead. so…

871
00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:43.250
Heroin. It wasn't masturbation related.
It's not on me. but…

872
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.958
Great guy. It was heartbreaking.
He was a really terrific guy.

873
00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:49.958
But you don't have to tighten up here.
He would have found this hilarious.

874
00:37:50.458 --> 00:37:53.166
I know there's always one person
thinking. "How do you know?"

875
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:56.125
We used to jack off together. so…

876
00:37:56.208 --> 00:37:57.833
[laughter]

877
00:37:58.666 --> 00:37:59.875
[cheering]

878
00:37:59.958 --> 00:38:02.375
You get to know a man
under those circumstances.

879
00:38:02.458 --> 00:38:03.375
[laughter]

880
00:38:07.333 --> 00:38:09.416
When I was in school. there were. uh…

881
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.125
We're in the home stretch here.
Don't worry. [laughs]

882
00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:14.291
You've been terrific. but…

883
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.416
When I was in school.
there were fewer mass shootings.

884
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:21.333
so every once in a while. we would
poke a kid to see if he had it in him and…

885
00:38:21.416 --> 00:38:22.875
[laughter]

886
00:38:24.708 --> 00:38:26.333
I do not feel good about this.

887
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.958
There was this one kid. Bit of a weirdo.
Unless he's here. then he's great. But…

888
00:38:31.041 --> 00:38:31.958
[laughter]

889
00:38:32.041 --> 00:38:35.125
He was a fun kid. I liked him.
He would speak out of place and time.

890
00:38:35.208 --> 00:38:37.625
He would say things like.
"A little birdie told me."

891
00:38:37.708 --> 00:38:38.833
Great expression.

892
00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:41.041
-[laughter]
-One of the best expressions.

893
00:38:41.125 --> 00:38:43.458
Always light. gossipy. Never depressing.

894
00:38:43.541 --> 00:38:47.166
Never like. "A little birdie told me.
uh. Bob is HIV positive."

895
00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:48.333
[laughter]

896
00:38:48.958 --> 00:38:50.291
"Is he gonna be okay?"

897
00:38:50.375 --> 00:38:52.458
"That's all the bird said. It was…"

898
00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:54.541
"It was a vague bird."

899
00:38:56.416 --> 00:38:58.958
I read this article
that said the way we speak to animals

900
00:38:59.041 --> 00:39:01.708
is often the way we wish
we were spoken to ourselves.

901
00:39:01.791 --> 00:39:04.375
I'm like. "That's not true."
But then I was on a date.

902
00:39:04.458 --> 00:39:06.666
She walks up to this dog.
She goes. "Look at you."

903
00:39:07.166 --> 00:39:10.333
"Look how little and thin you are."
I was like. "Wait a second."

904
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:13.166
Without thinking. I went up to the dog.

905
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.916
and I was like.
"You deserve to get your dick sucked."

906
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.125
[laughter]

907
00:39:17.208 --> 00:39:18.750
"You're a cool dude."

908
00:39:18.833 --> 00:39:20.083
[laughter]

909
00:39:20.166 --> 00:39:23.125
The woman was like.
"Please stop talking to my Labradoodle."

910
00:39:23.208 --> 00:39:24.708
[laughter]

911
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.375
I was teasing this kid.
We were young. I regret it.

912
00:39:31.458 --> 00:39:33.375
But he snapped. He goes. "That's it."

913
00:39:33.458 --> 00:39:35.833
"I'm bringing a gun to school.
I'm gonna shoot you."

914
00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:38.416
Everyone gasps. and he goes.
"I'm gonna shoot all of you."

915
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.083
And they all looked at me like.
"Thanks a lot. Sam."

916
00:39:41.166 --> 00:39:42.291
[laughter]

917
00:39:42.375 --> 00:39:47.333
And I had to be like. "Sorry. guys.
This potential massacre. totally on me."

918
00:39:47.416 --> 00:39:48.500
[laughter]

919
00:39:48.583 --> 00:39:52.125
He got suspended two weeks.
I don't know how you land on a number.

920
00:39:52.708 --> 00:39:55.916
[chuckles] They're like.
"He said he's gonna kill everybody?"

921
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.375
"Fourteen days. That…"

922
00:39:57.458 --> 00:39:58.708
[laughter]

923
00:39:58.791 --> 00:40:00.458
"It'll be out of his system."

924
00:40:00.541 --> 00:40:03.583
Like he's gonna come back then.
"Cured. All that…"

925
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:07.375
"All that alone time with my thoughts
was really good for me."

926
00:40:08.375 --> 00:40:10.375
"You can read about it in my manifesto."

927
00:40:10.458 --> 00:40:11.958
[laughter]

928
00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:14.625
It was the end of the year.
He went to a different school.

929
00:40:14.708 --> 00:40:16.000
He never came back.

930
00:40:16.083 --> 00:40:18.000
Next time I see him. 12 years later.

931
00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:20.500
I'm on stage in New York City
at the Comedy Cellar.

932
00:40:20.583 --> 00:40:24.541
I notice his face in the front row.
and my first thought was.

933
00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:26.708
"This motherfucker played the long game."

934
00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:28.625
[laughter]

935
00:40:32.208 --> 00:40:34.750
I almost respected
the way he built the suspense.

936
00:40:35.458 --> 00:40:37.833
He walks up to me after the show.
He was like. "Hey."

937
00:40:37.916 --> 00:40:40.083
He goes. "I'm a big fan."
I was like. "Thank God."

938
00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:41.666
[laughter]

939
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.541
He said. "It's cool you did
the things you said you were gonna do."

940
00:40:44.625 --> 00:40:47.000
I said. "It's really cool
that you did not." So…

941
00:40:47.083 --> 00:40:48.375
[laughter]

942
00:40:48.458 --> 00:40:49.708
Thank you so much.

943
00:40:49.791 --> 00:40:51.875
Really appreciate you guys.

944
00:40:51.958 --> 00:40:55.208
Appreciate you very much.

945
00:40:55.291 --> 00:40:56.291
We really do.

946
00:40:57.333 --> 00:40:58.791
Take care. guys.

947
00:40:58.875 --> 00:41:00.875
[cheering]

948
00:41:03.416 --> 00:41:05.416
[funky music plays]

949
00:41:36.416 --> 00:41:38.958
[inaudible speech]

950
00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:44.083
[funky music continues]

951
00:41:52.041 --> 00:41:54.791
-[man] Where's Gary?
-I don't wanna fucking do this.

952
00:41:54.875 --> 00:41:56.875
[laughter]

953
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
It's really good.

954
00:42:00.083 --> 00:42:02.333
[laughter]

955
00:42:02.416 --> 00:42:04.500
[man] I think it's hilarious that anyone…

956
00:42:04.583 --> 00:42:06.583
[funky music continues]

957
00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:11.666
I'm… I'm grateful you all came out.
It's gonna be a great night.

958
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:12.875
Before I come out there.

959
00:42:12.958 --> 00:42:15.500
I've got one of best friends
to open the show.

960
00:42:15.583 --> 00:42:16.791
He's the best.

961
00:42:16.875 --> 00:42:19.875
You better laugh hard
because his dick doesn't work. Um…

962
00:42:19.958 --> 00:42:21.125
[laughter]

963
00:42:21.208 --> 00:42:23.416
You've seen him on <i>Conan.</i>
You've seen him on <i>Colbert.</i>

964
00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.500
Give it up for Gary Vider!

965
00:42:25.583 --> 00:42:27.583
[cheering]

966
00:42:28.583 --> 00:42:29.791
[man] What is your name?

967
00:42:29.875 --> 00:42:31.500
-Conor Pinto.
-[man] Conor.

968
00:42:31.583 --> 00:42:34.916
[man] Do we have express permission
to use your likeness and your voice--

969
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.916
You have express consent

970
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.916
[man] All right. What are your names?

-Uh. Michael and Kim Pinto.
-Pinto.

972
00:42:44.625 --> 00:42:47.250
