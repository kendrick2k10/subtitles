your oil company in Mexico.

10
00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:15.684
[Chuck] Yes!

11
00:01:15.858 --> 00:01:17.338
I'’ll pay you guys
whatever you want.

12
00:01:17.512 --> 00:01:20.297
You just bring
my baby girl home alive.

[gunfire in distance][panting]

14
00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:28.392
I-- I can'’t see anything.

15
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:31.743
Brooke. I'’m Cal.
We'’re here to take you home.

16
00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:33.789
Lean forward.
I'’m gonna cut you loose.

17
00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.053
It'’s okay. It'’s okay.

18
00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:40.056
Stand up.

19
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.885
Grab my vest.
Don'’t let go.

Clear!

24
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:02.747
Zeke. get ready to go.

25
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.185
Where'’s Axel and Bradley?[Cal] They'’re right behind us.

30
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.112
I got you. brother.

[groans]

32
00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:29.252
[Cal] Get in the van!

33
00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:32.081
Bradley. drive!

34
00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:33.561
[Bradley] Where'’s Zeke?

[engine revs]

39
00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:02.546
[Cal] Drive!

40
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.679
[Bradley] What'’s happening?

41
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.898
Where'’s Axel?

42
00:04:08.552 --> 00:04:10.946
We gotta go back to get him.We can'’t!

43
00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:14.515
I'’m sorry. brother.

44
00:04:15.472 --> 00:04:18.040

[horse blusters]

46
00:06:33.218 --> 00:06:35.743
Could have saved you the trip.
I'’m still retired.

47
00:06:37.527 --> 00:06:39.834
Well. so am I.

48
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:44.491
You just come
all the way up here
to say hi?

49
00:06:44.665 --> 00:06:48.843
A guy'’s not allowed to
come check in on his favorite
cousin from time to time?

50
00:06:51.585 --> 00:06:54.283
You up for a beer?
I got a couple.

51
00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:56.154
Oh. yeah. Love one.

52
00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:03.248
Pretty out here.[beer caps pop]

53
00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:10.212
Quiet.

54
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.433
Just the way I like it.Thank you.

55
00:07:21.658 --> 00:07:23.486
Ever talk to Anders?

56
00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:28.752
No. Last I heard.
he was beach hopping
in Thailand.

57
00:07:28.926 --> 00:07:31.015
That was
last spring though.

58
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:34.541
Right.
That'’s what I'’d heard too.

59
00:07:34.715 --> 00:07:37.413
The number I had for him.
there'’s no answer.

60
00:07:39.546 --> 00:07:41.939
I was trying to invite him
to my wedding.

61
00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:48.032
Getting married?

62
00:07:48.206 --> 00:07:51.122
I am.
if you can believe that.

63
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.300
Uh. cheers to that.

64
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.563
Thank you.

65
00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:00.567
Who'’s the unlucky lady?
Anyone I know?

66
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.092
You do.

67
00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:06.573
Remember Brooke?

68
00:08:09.576 --> 00:08:11.099
The Brooke from...

69
00:08:11.882 --> 00:08:13.493
That'’s the one.

70
00:08:15.538 --> 00:08:16.670
Fuck.

71
00:08:18.193 --> 00:08:20.848
Uh. but. uh. congrats.

72
00:08:22.153 --> 00:08:25.200
I guess
losing Axel and Zeke
wasn'’t for nothing.

73
00:08:27.463 --> 00:08:28.986
Yeah.

74
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.598
It was rough. but they knew
what they were getting into.

75
00:08:31.772 --> 00:08:33.687
They knew the risks
of the job.

76
00:08:34.818 --> 00:08:35.906
Yeah.

77
00:08:36.603 --> 00:08:38.213
We all did.

78
00:08:45.263 --> 00:08:47.614
I want you
to be my best man.

79
00:08:49.093 --> 00:08:50.921
What do you say?

80
00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.191
Yeah.
I'’ll be there for you.

81
00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:03.368
Thanks.

82
00:09:41.015 --> 00:09:44.018
Oh. my God.
There'’s my baby.[laughs]

83
00:09:44.192 --> 00:09:45.497
Dad!There'’s my girl.

84
00:09:45.672 --> 00:09:47.543
Look at you.

85
00:09:47.717 --> 00:09:50.067
Dad.It'’s so good to see you.

86
00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:52.069
So good.

87
00:09:52.243 --> 00:09:55.377
You have time to
call this off. right?[both chuckle]

88
00:09:55.551 --> 00:09:57.945
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

89
00:09:58.119 --> 00:10:00.425
Didn'’t your heart
want it four times?

90
00:10:02.036 --> 00:10:04.038
Okay. Where'’s Cal?[chuckles]

91
00:10:04.212 --> 00:10:06.431
He'’s parking the car
and bringing the bags in.

92
00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.086
I see you still have
your entourage.

93
00:10:09.826 --> 00:10:11.872
[Chuck] Yeah.

94
00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:14.309
After what happened to you.
you think I'’m gonna leave home
without them?

95
00:10:14.483 --> 00:10:15.876
You shouldn'’t either.

96
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.225
I have Cal.

97
00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:19.270
And that'’s a long way
from here.

98
00:10:19.444 --> 00:10:21.359
Unfortunately. people
still know I'’ve got money.

99
00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:22.752
Yeah. '’cause
you don'’t hide it.

100
00:10:22.926 --> 00:10:24.493
[laughs]

101
00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:27.061
Nothing but the best
for my baby girl. right?I mean...

102
00:10:27.235 --> 00:10:29.977
I thought
I was your baby girl.[Chuck chuckles]

103
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:32.196
Oh. you almost look
as good as me.

104
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.198
[Chuck clears throat]

105
00:10:34.372 --> 00:10:36.418
This weekend'’s
about your sister.

106
00:10:36.592 --> 00:10:38.463
Hi. Daddy.Hey. baby doll.

107
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.730
Welcome. everyone.
I hope you all had
a pleasant journey in.

108
00:10:43.904 --> 00:10:46.254
Yes. we did.
Thank you.Oh. wonderful.

109
00:10:46.428 --> 00:10:48.560
The rest of the hotel guests
are checking out.

110
00:10:48.735 --> 00:10:52.216
which means you and
your wedding party will have
the entire resort to yourselves

111
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.131
for the remainder
of the weekend.

112
00:10:54.305 --> 00:10:56.351
Seriously. Dad?Nothing but the best.

113
00:10:57.482 --> 00:10:59.833
Is there any cell service here?

114
00:11:00.007 --> 00:11:04.054
Uh. actually. you'’ll find that
a few days out here is like
taking a walk back in time.

115
00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:06.709
That'’s why presidents
and dignitaries
from around the world

116
00:11:06.883 --> 00:11:09.843
not only enjoy our seclusion
and accommodations.

117
00:11:10.017 --> 00:11:11.845
but also come back
for repeat visits.

118
00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:14.586
So there'’s no cell service?[Chuck chuckles]

119
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:19.374
No. But we do have Wi-Fi
and plenty of beautiful
mountain views.

120
00:11:19.548 --> 00:11:23.726
Make no mistake. this is
a weekend that you and your
guests will never forget.

121
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.641
If you'’ll follow me.
I'’ll give you a tour.

122
00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:28.296
Go on over here.
That'’s okay.

123
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.125
Now. as you can see.
we'’re surrounded by
pristine wilderness.

124
00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:33.649
We have
a 36-hole golf course.

125
00:11:33.823 --> 00:11:36.478
15 miles of beautiful
hiking trails.

126
00:11:36.652 --> 00:11:40.003
We also have
a spa on the grounds.
Every treatment imaginable.

127
00:11:40.177 --> 00:11:42.136
[sister]
What celebrities visited here?

128
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.617
[manager] Oh. I'’m not able
to disclose exactly who...[elevator dings]

129
00:11:51.536 --> 00:11:52.929
Guess I found
the right place.[chuckles]

130
00:11:53.103 --> 00:11:56.106
Bradley. hey.Hey.

131
00:11:56.977 --> 00:11:58.456
I'’m so glad you'’re here.

132
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.328
Ah. wouldn'’t miss it.

133
00:12:02.634 --> 00:12:04.506
Uh... [chuckles]

134
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.248
You could have almost
gotten married at my place
in the mountains.

135
00:12:07.422 --> 00:12:09.641
I don'’t have a lake
like that though.[chuckles]

136
00:12:09.816 --> 00:12:12.601
Oh. this is gorgeous.

137
00:12:12.775 --> 00:12:14.864
Hey. my dad'’s here.
You wanna come say hi?

138
00:12:16.866 --> 00:12:18.738
Yeah. I suppose I should.

139
00:12:22.872 --> 00:12:24.787
Over here
is our five-star restaurant.

140
00:12:24.961 --> 00:12:27.747
which will be hosting
your rehearsal dinner
later this evening.

141
00:12:29.183 --> 00:12:30.575
Yes!

142
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.143
[gasps] This is where
your ceremony is gonna be.

143
00:12:33.317 --> 00:12:35.580
Sorry.Chuck.
good to see you again.

144
00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.147
Bradley. good to see you.

145
00:12:37.321 --> 00:12:38.975
Especially on
better circumstances.
you know?

146
00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:40.498
Right.Give me just a minute.

147
00:12:40.672 --> 00:12:42.587
Let me finish right here.
and I'’ll be back.

148
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:43.632
Thanks.

149
00:12:44.589 --> 00:12:46.330
Oh. this is my sister.

150
00:12:46.504 --> 00:12:49.116
Uh. Hailey. right?And the maid of honor.

151
00:12:50.204 --> 00:12:52.380
Bradley. The best man.

152
00:12:52.554 --> 00:12:54.077
Nice to meet you.

153
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:55.687
You too.

154
00:12:55.862 --> 00:12:58.125
[Chuck] You'’ve exceeded
all my expectations.

155
00:12:58.299 --> 00:13:01.345
Wonderful. Well. I'’ll make sure
our staff has everything
set up beautifully

156
00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:03.217
for the big celebration
in the morning.

157
00:13:03.391 --> 00:13:06.002
Now. if you'’ll all follow me.
we'’ll head to the casino.

158
00:13:12.704 --> 00:13:14.097
It'’s great.

159
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.188
[keypad beeping]

160
00:14:06.758 --> 00:14:09.718
All right. We got slots.
table games. you know.
fun for the whole family.

161
00:14:09.892 --> 00:14:12.242
And I know
it looks busy right now.
but like I said.

162
00:14:12.416 --> 00:14:14.592
this entire casino
will be completely empty

163
00:14:14.766 --> 00:14:17.813
and only available to you
and your guests later today
and throughout the weekend.

164
00:14:17.987 --> 00:14:21.208
Somebody was telling me
this place had a safe room.

165
00:14:21.382 --> 00:14:24.080
Oh. um. yeah. we do.I'’d like to see it.

166
00:14:24.254 --> 00:14:26.866
Oh. no. It'’s really
nothing you would ever need.

167
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.042
Where is it?

168
00:14:29.216 --> 00:14:31.696
Um. yes. sir. Yeah.
It'’s right this way.

169
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.003
[slot machines chiming]

170
00:14:39.835 --> 00:14:41.837
[quiet music playing
on speakers]

171
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.239
You know. I'’m out there
in the lobby.

172
00:14:52.413 --> 00:14:54.284
and I'’m listening
to this good-lookin'’ woman

173
00:14:54.458 --> 00:14:57.070
talk about this big. tall.
handsome blond guy

174
00:14:57.244 --> 00:15:00.682
she saw sittin'’ all alone
at the bar.

175
00:15:00.856 --> 00:15:03.990
And as I listen
to her describe the guy.
I think to myself.

176
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.296
"I bet I know him."

177
00:15:07.384 --> 00:15:08.908
And I do.

178
00:15:09.734 --> 00:15:11.345
You didn'’t take the tour?

179
00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:16.263
No. I'’m... taking the tour
of bourbon country.

180
00:15:16.437 --> 00:15:18.656
I see that.It'’s great to see you.
brother.

181
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.571
Good to see you too.Hey.

182
00:15:21.268 --> 00:15:22.791
[sighs]

183
00:15:24.967 --> 00:15:26.838
I wasn'’t sure
you'’d make it.

184
00:15:27.013 --> 00:15:30.320
Hell. I wasn'’t even sure
I had the right number.

185
00:15:30.494 --> 00:15:34.759
Yeah. look. I--
I still check my messages
once in a while. It'’s--

186
00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.545
In some countries.
it'’s harder than others.
you know?

187
00:15:39.329 --> 00:15:41.288
Retirement
looks good on you.

188
00:15:43.072 --> 00:15:45.205
It does.Sun. sand.

189
00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:46.467
Right.

190
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:48.860
Women. Well. you know.

191
00:15:49.035 --> 00:15:52.690
There you have it.Uh. Thailand. [chuckles]

192
00:15:52.864 --> 00:15:56.172
Ma'’am.
I'’ll do the same. please.

193
00:16:02.222 --> 00:16:03.397
Thank you.

194
00:16:04.615 --> 00:16:05.877
Thanks for coming.

195
00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.228
I mean it.

196
00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:12.884
Cheers.[glasses clink]

197
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:22.329
Been kind of
a long. hard road.
hasn'’t it. buddy?

198
00:16:23.678 --> 00:16:24.722
Yeah.

199
00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.029
Yeah. remember--

200
00:16:27.203 --> 00:16:28.857
remember that time
in Afghanistan

201
00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:33.644
we got cut into that bottle
of confiscated grappa?

202
00:16:33.818 --> 00:16:36.734
I thought my fuckin'’ teeth
were gonna fall out
from that stuff.

203
00:16:36.908 --> 00:16:39.041
Well. you became
a man that day.Bullshit!

204
00:16:39.215 --> 00:16:43.045
[chuckles] I--
I think I'’d earned my stripes
well before that night.

205
00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:47.093
Stuck in the sand. drunk.

206
00:16:48.964 --> 00:16:51.010
It was an impossible
situation.

207
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.013
Next morning. we...

208
00:16:55.797 --> 00:16:57.755
did what we had to do.

209
00:16:59.627 --> 00:17:01.020
Yeah.

210
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.546
That. I wouldn'’t mind
forgettin'’.

211
00:17:06.982 --> 00:17:07.983
Yeah.

212
00:17:08.897 --> 00:17:10.855
That'’s why I drink
to pass out.

213
00:17:11.639 --> 00:17:12.596
[chuckles]

214
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.598
Helps me to forget.
I guess.

215
00:17:15.947 --> 00:17:19.038
I guess Brooke'’s
my vice now.

216
00:17:19.212 --> 00:17:23.999
We kind of help each other
get through the hard times
together.

217
00:17:24.173 --> 00:17:25.435
Mmm.

218
00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:28.960
Well. in that case.
if Brooke is your vice.

219
00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:32.268
then this is my Brooke.

220
00:17:32.442 --> 00:17:34.836
Cheers. Congrats.

221
00:17:35.967 --> 00:17:38.100
Missed you.Missed you too.

222
00:17:44.802 --> 00:17:46.630
[door opens]All right. follow me this way.

223
00:17:46.804 --> 00:17:48.980
This is where we. uh.
make all the magic happen.

224
00:17:49.155 --> 00:17:50.460
Don'’t mind the mess.

225
00:17:50.634 --> 00:17:52.462
So our. uh. staff cafeteria
is back that way.

226
00:17:52.636 --> 00:17:54.769
and the admin offices
are at the end of the hall.

227
00:17:54.943 --> 00:17:57.641
Yeah. Well. you know.
that'’s cool. but I just
wanna see the safe room.

228
00:17:57.815 --> 00:18:00.296
Ah. yes. well.
it'’s actually. um--
kind of doubles as two rooms.

229
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.907
It'’s our high-tech security room
and it acts as a safe room.

230
00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:05.780
which we have been
fortunate enough
to never have had to use.

231
00:18:05.954 --> 00:18:07.869
All right.
Now. there are two ways in.

232
00:18:08.043 --> 00:18:11.090
One is typing in the code
that only our security team
and myself know.

233
00:18:11.264 --> 00:18:14.789
The other is through
the security guard.
who'’s always stationed inside.

234
00:18:14.963 --> 00:18:17.531
They monitor the entire resort
at all times.

235
00:18:18.575 --> 00:18:19.663
Then open the door.

236
00:18:20.621 --> 00:18:22.318
Yeah.[keypad beeps]

237
00:18:27.062 --> 00:18:29.586
[electronic lock buzzes]

238
00:18:30.892 --> 00:18:32.198
Right this way.

239
00:18:33.503 --> 00:18:35.288
Now. our monitors
are back here in the cage.

240
00:18:35.462 --> 00:18:38.291
Please don'’t touch anything.

241
00:18:38.465 --> 00:18:40.423
All right.
Come on in. guys.

242
00:18:40.597 --> 00:18:43.165
So these cameras
just capture everything.
It'’s all state-of-the-art.

243
00:18:43.339 --> 00:18:45.298
If somebody drops
a quarter on the ground.

244
00:18:45.472 --> 00:18:47.778
we can zoom in and tell you
what year it was printed.

245
00:18:49.258 --> 00:18:50.129
No.

246
00:18:51.521 --> 00:18:53.610
What?Absolutely not.

247
00:18:54.611 --> 00:18:55.612
[scoffs]

248
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:02.706
Yeah. that guy was a real prick.
We all wanted to kill him.[laughs]

249
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.013
Too bad
he was a colonel.Right.

250
00:19:05.187 --> 00:19:06.797
No. lieutenant colonel.

251
00:19:06.971 --> 00:19:08.408
Yeah. Yeah.

252
00:19:08.582 --> 00:19:11.106
Yeah.
he was from Connecticut.[both chuckle]

253
00:19:12.368 --> 00:19:14.588
There'’s my handsome man.

254
00:19:14.762 --> 00:19:16.372
Hey.Well. wait. wait. wait.

255
00:19:16.546 --> 00:19:18.592
That'’s what you'’re marrying?
This guy?

256
00:19:18.766 --> 00:19:20.159
[chuckles]

257
00:19:21.508 --> 00:19:23.205
Thanks for coming.
Anders.

258
00:19:23.379 --> 00:19:27.427
[clears throat] Yeah.I. uh. know it means a lot
to this guy.

259
00:19:29.037 --> 00:19:30.778
That'’s great.

260
00:19:30.952 --> 00:19:35.261
Yeah. it'’s great. All right.
Well. you guys. um. have fun.

261
00:19:36.566 --> 00:19:37.567
[grunts]

262
00:19:39.134 --> 00:19:41.963
I didn'’t interrupt
anything. did I?No. no.

263
00:19:42.137 --> 00:19:45.445
Just. uh.
takes a little while
to get to know him.

264
00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:46.620
That'’s all.

265
00:19:47.577 --> 00:19:49.188
Let'’s go cruise around.Yes.

266
00:19:55.759 --> 00:19:58.414
[lever pulls][slot machine chimes]

267

[chimes]

270
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.745
Oh.

271
00:20:26.486 --> 00:20:27.791
How you feeling. baby?

272
00:20:27.965 --> 00:20:30.403
Me? I'’m pretty good.

273
00:20:30.577 --> 00:20:33.667
I was honestly.
I think. more nervous
couple of months ago.

274
00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:35.538
Now I'’m just excited.

275
00:20:35.712 --> 00:20:38.454
I think that'’s '’cause
of how much I love you.

276
00:20:38.628 --> 00:20:40.761
This is why I make
all the big decisions.

277
00:20:40.935 --> 00:20:43.154
Damn right.[chuckles]

278
00:20:45.548 --> 00:20:47.246
Okay.
let'’s make a promise.

279
00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.206
For our first anniversary.
we go someplace tropical.
right?

280
00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.556
Where you can actually
play golf outside.

281
00:20:55.689 --> 00:20:58.605
I just wonder if I might
have made a mistake.

282
00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.998
Excuse me?[hits ball]

283
00:21:04.045 --> 00:21:06.743
You think I should have
made Anders my best man?

284
00:21:08.092 --> 00:21:09.224
Come on. honey.

285
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.794
We talked about this.
Get it out of your head.

286
00:21:14.838 --> 00:21:16.579
This weekend is about us.

287
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.543
You'’re right.
You'’re right.Hmm?

288
00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:26.067
But. hey.

289
00:21:26.241 --> 00:21:28.199
if anything
ever happens to me.

290
00:21:29.853 --> 00:21:31.594
he'’ll be there
to protect you.

291
00:21:33.857 --> 00:21:35.163
I like you.

292
00:21:39.254 --> 00:21:40.603
All right. Let'’s see it.Okay.

293
00:21:40.777 --> 00:21:42.126
You'’ve had
a couple of lessons.

294
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:43.519
Okay. wait. Okay.

295
00:21:43.693 --> 00:21:45.173
Ready?Step one.

296
00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:49.699
And... batter up.

297
00:21:49.873 --> 00:21:51.135
This?

298
00:21:52.876 --> 00:21:57.620
Yeah. that'’s good for baseball.
but for golf. not so great.[laughs]

299
00:21:57.794 --> 00:21:58.795
Why--

300
00:21:58.969 --> 00:22:00.319
Feel like a club pro here.Yep.

301

Okay. Miss Farnsworth.

Getting the grip.

304
00:22:08.196 --> 00:22:10.851
Put that left hand down
like that.

305
00:22:11.025 --> 00:22:13.201
Cover it up
with your right hand.

306
00:22:14.507 --> 00:22:18.075
Bring it back slowly.
and then...

307
00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:21.470
Uh. I'’m sorry.
I thought this was
a golf lesson.

308
00:22:21.644 --> 00:22:25.431
Ma'’am. I don'’t know
what came over me.
I-I apologize.

Uh. here'’s what
I'’m gonna do.

310
00:22:28.434 --> 00:22:32.481
I'’m gonna give you the lesson
for free as long as you
don'’t tell my boss.

[chuckles]

312
00:22:34.527 --> 00:22:35.919

All right. Now. look...
[clears throat]

321
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.125
I'’m gonna give you some advice.
not that you'’re asking for it.

322
00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:12.260
Have fun. Have a great weekend.
but be careful. you know.

Got it.

325
00:23:15.437 --> 00:23:17.265
Mind if I play a bit?

326
00:23:17.439 --> 00:23:18.527
Relax.

All right.

331
00:23:38.895 --> 00:23:40.767
I always just thought
that was a pickup line.

332

when he said
he could play the piano.

One more thing.

Need you to hold on
to this for me.

343

00:24:36.823 --> 00:24:38.041
You and Cal.

350
00:24:38.825 --> 00:24:40.435
Oh. uh. cousins.

351
00:24:40.609 --> 00:24:42.350
Our moms are sisters.

352
00:24:42.524 --> 00:24:43.569
Huh.

353
00:24:44.744 --> 00:24:47.137
You two don'’t have
a lot of family.

354
00:24:47.311 --> 00:24:49.183
Are any of your relatives
joining?

355
00:24:50.184 --> 00:24:51.446
No.

356
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.927
Probably better that way.
We'’re--

357
00:24:54.101 --> 00:24:58.192
Well. our family is
more likely to be the help
than the ones getting help.

358
00:24:59.193 --> 00:25:01.108
Guess you could say
we'’re low-key.

359
00:25:02.762 --> 00:25:04.154
I like low-key.

360
00:25:07.375 --> 00:25:08.419
Do you. though?

361
00:25:10.073 --> 00:25:11.945
Okay. burn.

363
00:25:13.816 --> 00:25:15.078
Sorry.
Cal told me that...

364
00:25:17.254 --> 00:25:20.649
I should. uh.
keep my eye on you.

365
00:25:22.216 --> 00:25:23.522
In what way?

366
00:25:26.394 --> 00:25:27.656
I don'’t know.

367
00:25:28.744 --> 00:25:33.183
So I guess you won'’t
be joining me then.

368
00:25:34.924 --> 00:25:35.925
Too bad.

369
00:25:42.671 --> 00:25:43.890

Why'’d you stop?

384
00:27:39.483 --> 00:27:43.183
I just wanna let you know
that I was married.

385
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.099
Oh.

386
00:27:46.273 --> 00:27:47.448
Okay.

She died a couple years ago.

389
00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.587
It'’s the only reason
I took the job
your dad offered.

390
00:27:56.762 --> 00:28:00.069
'’cause I didn'’t expect
to make it back.

391
00:28:02.724 --> 00:28:04.291
I'’m sorry to hear that.

392
00:28:05.901 --> 00:28:07.468
But I'’m glad you did.

393
00:28:08.556 --> 00:28:10.950
My sister wouldn'’t be here
if you didn'’t.

394
00:28:17.521 --> 00:28:18.609
We can go back.

Nothing but the best
for this wedding party.

Well. it don'’t look like
I'’m the only one here
that could use a drink.

418
00:29:59.536 --> 00:30:01.147
Mind if I join you?

419
00:30:01.321 --> 00:30:02.539
Be my guest.

420
00:30:11.722 --> 00:30:13.986
You know.
it'’s a hell of a place
you picked here.

421
00:30:15.335 --> 00:30:16.858
Yeah. it is.

I didn'’t even get an invite.

I bet this wedding wouldn'’t
have happened either.

01:02:38.232 --> 01:02:39.277
Hey.

708
01:02:44.064 --> 01:02:45.196
You knew him!

709
01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:46.675
This is all your fault!No. Hey. hey.

710
01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:48.982
Stop. Stop.
Hey! Stop. Quiet. quiet.

711
01:02:49.156 --> 01:02:51.680
Hailey. please.
quiet. okay?

712
01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:53.813
They'’re gonna--Who was that?

713
01:02:55.859 --> 01:02:57.425
It was Axel.

714
01:02:57.599 --> 01:03:00.428
I thought you said
he was dead.

715
01:03:00.602 --> 01:03:02.387
I thought he was.

716
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.130
If he kills my dad.
it'’s on you.

717
01:03:08.132 --> 01:03:10.525
I just gotta-- Hey.Get the fuck off me!
Get off me!

718
01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:14.138
Can you keep it down.
They'’re gonna find us.Fuck.

719
01:03:17.358 --> 01:03:19.056
[sobbing]

720
01:03:23.016 --> 01:03:24.017
Hey.

721
01:03:46.735 --> 01:03:48.825
My-My-My dad has a phone.

722
01:03:50.957 --> 01:03:52.872
He has a satellite phone.

723
01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:56.658
What do you mean. he'’s...His room.

724
01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:06.277
Come on.

725
01:04:10.585 --> 01:04:11.804
Hi. Chuck.

726
01:04:12.674 --> 01:04:14.198
You know who I am?

727
01:04:14.372 --> 01:04:15.939
[breathing heavily]

728
01:04:16.113 --> 01:04:18.245
We'’ve never had the pleasure
of meeting in person.

729
01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:20.465
but we have spoken
on the phone a few times.

730
01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:26.514
I talk to a lot
of fuckin'’ people.

731
01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:32.651
Does the name Axel Bates
ring a bell?

732
01:04:39.092 --> 01:04:41.268
You'’re a dead man.

733
01:04:41.442 --> 01:04:42.487
Well.

734
01:04:43.662 --> 01:04:46.665
death certainly
would have been merciful.

735
01:04:46.839 --> 01:04:49.450
But instead. I was picked up
by those friendly folk

736
01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:51.539
who kidnapped your daughter.

737
01:04:53.106 --> 01:04:54.629
Tortured me
for a couple of months.

738
01:04:54.803 --> 01:04:57.197
Unfortunately for them.

739
01:04:57.371 --> 01:04:59.504
they just got a little
too comfortable with me.

740
01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:01.985
So they'’re gone.

741
01:05:03.856 --> 01:05:07.251
And here I am with a fresh.
new perspective on life.

742
01:05:09.818 --> 01:05:13.518
Let me tell you something.
you son of a bitch.

743
01:05:13.692 --> 01:05:16.042
All I wanted was
to get my daughter back.

744
01:05:17.043 --> 01:05:18.262
What about Zeke?

745
01:05:19.176 --> 01:05:20.264
He was someone'’s kid.

746
01:05:21.091 --> 01:05:22.614
And he has a daughter.

747
01:05:23.658 --> 01:05:25.486
Zoey is five years old
right now.

748
01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:28.794
And guess what. Chuck?
Her daddy ain'’t
ever comin'’ home.

749
01:05:30.752 --> 01:05:32.319
So let me ask you:

750
01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:36.236
Is Brooke'’s life
more valuable than Zeke?

751
01:05:40.632 --> 01:05:42.112
No!

752
01:05:44.157 --> 01:05:45.071
Goddamn right.

753
01:05:45.245 --> 01:05:47.291
[gunshot]No!

754
01:05:47.465 --> 01:05:50.337
[groaning]

755
01:05:50.511 --> 01:05:51.556
No. you didn'’t...

756
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.819
No. No!

757
01:05:53.993 --> 01:05:56.691
[continues groaning]

758
01:06:07.528 --> 01:06:09.226
[gunfire]

759
01:06:12.446 --> 01:06:13.491
[neck cracks]

760
01:06:17.321 --> 01:06:21.890
It'’s okay. Come on.[breathing heavily]

761
01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.295
Put some pressure on it.[groans]

762
01:06:39.212 --> 01:06:41.345
That was the first place
I was shot.

763
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.349
That'’s the second.

764
01:06:45.523 --> 01:06:48.178
And it left me
with a hell of a headache.

765
01:06:48.352 --> 01:06:51.137
You wanna see
what it feels like?No. no. no. no. No.

766
01:06:52.834 --> 01:06:54.401
I'’ll do whatever.

767
01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:55.620
Good.

768
01:06:57.839 --> 01:07:01.191
Because you offered us
five million dollars
to bring your daughter home.

769
01:07:01.365 --> 01:07:02.670
I want my share.

770
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.064
Is that what you want?

771
01:07:05.238 --> 01:07:06.805
You want a million bucks?

772
01:07:06.979 --> 01:07:09.199
I'’ll make it happen.No.

773
01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:11.810
No. no.

774
01:07:13.246 --> 01:07:15.596
What are both
your daughters'’ lives
worth to you?

775
01:07:16.336 --> 01:07:18.556
Two times? Three?

776
01:07:21.254 --> 01:07:22.951
I don'’t have
that kind of money.

777
01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:24.170
Fine.

778
01:07:24.344 --> 01:07:25.345
[gunshot][shouts]

779
01:07:25.519 --> 01:07:27.739
No! Oh. no!

780
01:07:28.435 --> 01:07:30.785
Oh. shit.

781
01:07:30.959 --> 01:07:32.483
You want
five million dollars?

782
01:07:32.657 --> 01:07:34.006
I'’ll give you
five million dollars.

783
01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.487
That'’s not enough
for what I went through.

784
01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:39.229
7.5.

785
01:07:39.403 --> 01:07:43.189
But I promise you.
that'’s all I can get out.

786
01:07:46.714 --> 01:07:47.672
Okay.

787
01:07:47.846 --> 01:07:49.413
I can live with that.

788
01:07:51.502 --> 01:07:54.157
I don'’t begrudge you
for what you did. Chuck.

789
01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:57.464
Any father with your means
would have done
the exact same thing.

790
01:07:59.162 --> 01:08:02.730
But Cal. Bradley. Anders.

791
01:08:04.297 --> 01:08:06.082
they made their choice.

792
01:08:06.256 --> 01:08:08.127
And now it'’s time
for their reckoning.

793
01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:12.958
Listen. Now. I don'’t care.

794
01:08:15.874 --> 01:08:17.615
Just don'’t
hurt my daughters.

795
01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:23.099
You do what you say
you'’re gonna do.

796
01:08:23.273 --> 01:08:25.623
you have my word.

797
01:08:25.797 --> 01:08:29.409
You fuck with me.
I'’m gonna kill everyone
in here.

798
01:08:29.583 --> 01:08:32.499
And then I'’m gonna
make you watch while I
kill your daughters.

799
01:08:32.673 --> 01:08:34.066
Got it?

800
01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.459
Got it.

801
01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:38.418
I got it.

802
01:08:38.592 --> 01:08:39.550
[Marshall on speakers]
Hey. gang.

803
01:08:39.724 --> 01:08:41.552
Pay close attention now.

804
01:08:41.726 --> 01:08:45.686
We have. uh. five
wedding members currently
roaming the hallways.

805
01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:47.645
Ooh. get this.
In the kitchen.

806
01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:51.127
yeah. we have the lovely
bride-to-be. Brooke.

807
01:08:51.301 --> 01:08:55.957
I think
that she is with a blast
from the past. Anders.

808
01:08:56.132 --> 01:08:58.177
Asshole.

809
01:08:58.351 --> 01:08:59.961
And that'’s not all. gang.

810
01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:04.705
And we have the bride'’s sister.
Hailey. maid of honor.

811
01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:06.403
Yep. On the third-floor suite.

812
01:09:06.577 --> 01:09:09.580
And she'’s with the best man.
Bradley.

813
01:09:09.754 --> 01:09:13.018
But watch out.
Bradley'’s got a gun.
and it does go bang. bang.

814
01:09:13.192 --> 01:09:14.541
[chuckles] All right.

815
01:09:14.715 --> 01:09:17.327
And then. gang.
our number one target. Cal.

816
01:09:17.501 --> 01:09:20.547
the unlucky groom.

817
01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:23.637
Looks like he'’s heading
to the top-floor suites.
I believe.

818
01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:26.988
Happy hunting.[laughing]

819
01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:30.427
We have to go.Wait. wait. wait.

820
01:09:30.601 --> 01:09:32.907
Someone will come.
But don'’t worry. I have a plan.

821
01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.213
You need to surrender.

822
01:09:34.387 --> 01:09:36.215
What?Yes.

823
01:09:36.389 --> 01:09:38.609
Put your hands up.
stay right here and surrender.

824
01:09:38.783 --> 01:09:40.741
Trust me.
I'’ll handle the rest.

825
01:09:40.915 --> 01:09:42.743
Okay.I'’m not leaving you.

Where'’s Anders?No.

829
01:10:02.763 --> 01:10:04.287
Let'’s go get me my money.

830
01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:06.289
Come on.

831
01:10:07.899 --> 01:10:09.814

Ah. but since you have
the lovely bride that-was-to-be.
