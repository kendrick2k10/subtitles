Nah. I don't think so.

1257
01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:05.633

1263
01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:25.945

Probably better known to all of
you as the Wog Boy.

1290
01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:39.435
He became famous over 20 years
ago

1291
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:42.772
on this show for being
a dole bludger.

1292
01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:45.941
Well. you'll never guess what
he's up to now.

1293
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.488
He's a cabbie. and here he is
hooning around in his taxi.

1294
01:05:50.571 --> 01:05:53.574
dragging off other cars
through the city streets.

1295
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:54.659
Can you believe this?

1296
01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:56.452
He's also a party bus host

1297
01:05:56.535 --> 01:05:59.497

to escaped asylum seekers.

1298
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.292

1299
01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:04.794
Ruben!

1300
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:06.754
He's been on the run for three
years

1301
01:06:06.837 --> 01:06:09.048
since he escaped from
a detention centre.

1302
01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:11.175
Man. you've got help me
get out of here.

1303
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.302
And it wouldn't be a real party

1304
01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:16.305
unless the Wog Boy's old mate.
Frank Di Benedetto was there
too.

1305

Remember him?
Daddy. you're on TV!
