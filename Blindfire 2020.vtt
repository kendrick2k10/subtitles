00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:19.834
Shit. Shit.

5
00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:21.670
Sir. could
you try to remain calm?

6
00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:22.772
What is your emergency?

7
00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:24.006
I-

8
00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.574
Let's start
by giving me your name

9
00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:27.309
- and your address.
- Don't tell me what to do.

10
00:00:27.342 --> 00:00:29.010
Don't you ever tell me
what do. do you understand?

11
00:00:29.044 --> 00:00:30.713
I do understand.

12
00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:31.980
How can I help you?

13
00:00:32.013 --> 00:00:33.749
I won't
let her take my kids.

14
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:34.649
She can't take them.

15
00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:35.650
She can't. They're mine.

16
00:00:35.683 --> 00:00:37.485
Sir. I need
to know where you are

17
00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:38.987
so that I can send help.

18
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:40.956
14
Independence Square.

19
00:00:40.988 --> 00:00:42.757
I'll fucking shoot
her if she leaves.

20
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.858
You have to stop her.

21
00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:46.963
If she tries to take my
kids. I'll fucking kill her.

22
00:01:05.447 --> 00:01:07.350
So
what? It's chicken.

23
00:01:09.617 --> 00:01:10.885
Don't fucking judge me.

24
00:01:10.918 --> 00:01:12.420
It's not me.

25
00:01:12.453 --> 00:01:15.056
Adam asks his
guests all the time.

26
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.593
Okay. what do you
have against chicken?

27
00:01:17.626 --> 00:01:18.761
Nothing. Nothing.

28
00:01:18.793 --> 00:01:20.096
Bake it. fry it. barbecue it.

29
00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:22.731
Just don't put it in a taco.

30
00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:24.933
You're crazy. it's delicious.

31
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.868
Oh. my god. whatever.
You know what?

32
00:01:26.902 --> 00:01:28.070
You get a pass.

33
00:01:28.102 --> 00:01:29.003
You get a pass
'cause you grew up

34
00:01:29.037 --> 00:01:30.373
around mostly white people.

35
00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:31.106
Oh. well. I'm sorry
I didn't grow up

36
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.843
eating lengua or barbacoa.

37
00:01:33.876 --> 00:01:34.977
Besides. look at you.

38
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.879
You're eating rabbit
food in a wrap.

39
00:01:36.912 --> 00:01:37.847
Eh!

40
00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:38.813
I love meat.

41
00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:40.548
I love meat.

42
00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:42.150
It's just Maria wanted us
to try this vegan shit.

43
00:01:42.183 --> 00:01:43.819
so what am I supposed to do?

44
00:01:43.852 --> 00:01:44.853
I don't see Maria here.

45
00:01:44.887 --> 00:01:46.155
Yeah. but I'm gonna go home

46
00:01:46.188 --> 00:01:47.890
and she's gonna ask me
what I had for lunch.

47
00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:50.459
so what am I supposed to
do. lie to her every day?

48
00:01:50.492 --> 00:01:52.795
You tell Maria what you
had for lunch every day?

You did good.

I'm glad you and Wilkins
made it outta there safe.

105
00:05:14.196 --> 00:05:16.666
You may have saved that
girl's life tonight.

106
00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.771
Dispatch said the guy talked
about burning the house down.

107
00:05:25.307 --> 00:05:27.076
Are you all right?

108
00:05:27.108 --> 00:05:29.311
I know this was the first
time you've had to...

109
00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:32.915
I'm fine. Sergeant.

110
00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:37.318
It's okay.

111
00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:40.722
It's not supposed to be easy.

112
00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:42.123
Most officers are lucky.

113
00:05:42.156 --> 00:05:46.161
they go their whole careers
without firing a weapon.

114
00:05:46.194 --> 00:05:48.664
It's a difficult
thing to prepare for.

115
00:05:50.132 --> 00:05:51.834
It's part of the job.

116
00:05:56.071 --> 00:05:57.773
I'm here if you need me.

117
00:06:00.675 --> 00:06:03.077
Don't have to talk to
some stranger about it

118
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.279
if you don't want to.

119
00:06:05.312 --> 00:06:06.714
Get some rest.

120
00:06:06.747 --> 00:06:08.750
Someone from HR
will call tomorrow

121
00:06:08.783 --> 00:06:10.719
and walk you through everything.

122
00:06:19.194 --> 00:06:21.129
- Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm fine.

123
00:06:21.163 --> 00:06:21.997
Okay.

124
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.735
Why didn't you call me? Had
to hear it from Wilkins?

125
00:06:26.767 --> 00:06:28.302
Had to give my
statement to the FID.

126
00:06:28.336 --> 00:06:31.340
and then Sergeant
wanted to talk to me.

127
00:06:31.372 --> 00:06:32.875
I wasn't thinking.

128
00:06:34.276 --> 00:06:36.912
I got really scared
thinking about losing you.

129
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.814
Can we. um

130
00:06:41.983 --> 00:06:44.786
Can you just come home?
Can you come home?

131
00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:45.654
I can't.

132
00:06:47.088 --> 00:06:49.425
Wilkins and I. we have some
paperwork to finish. so...

133
00:06:52.827 --> 00:06:55.997
That's fine. I
mean. come back home.

134
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:02.704
Jan.

135
00:07:05.774 --> 00:07:07.276
I'll call you tonight.

136
00:07:13.348 --> 00:07:13.982
Okay.

137
00:07:17.252 --> 00:07:19.155
Really glad you're all right.

138
00:07:39.206 --> 00:07:41.076
I did not
see this one coming.

139
00:07:41.108 --> 00:07:42.110
Yeah. I should've
been there with you.

140
00:07:42.144 --> 00:07:43.778
You should've waited.

141
00:07:43.812 --> 00:07:45.280
Wasn't going in. I
was just trying to hear

142
00:07:45.312 --> 00:07:47.315
what he was saying
through the window.

143
00:07:47.348 --> 00:07:48.317
Then he kicked the door open.

144
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.785
almost took my fucking face off-

145
00:07:49.817 --> 00:07:51.353
- You got lucky.

146
00:07:51.386 --> 00:07:54.256
You're gonna get yourself
killed pulling the hero shit.

147
00:07:55.357 --> 00:07:56.892
Fuck.

148
00:07:56.925 --> 00:07:58.093
Fucking wired.

149
00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:06.435
What makes a guy do
that to his own family?

150
00:08:11.372 --> 00:08:12.942
Gonna get another drink.

151
00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:15.310
I'm good.

152
00:08:15.343 --> 00:08:16.378
Yeah?

153
00:08:17.444 --> 00:08:19.113
Hey. hero.

154
00:08:19.146 --> 00:08:20.949
Celebrating your big day. huh?

155
00:08:22.317 --> 00:08:23.319
All right.

156
00:08:24.418 --> 00:08:25.253
What?

157
00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:28.324
Andre was my guy.

158
00:08:29.324 --> 00:08:32.427
Yeah. We played ball
at Central together.

159
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.295
Good man.

160
00:08:34.495 --> 00:08:35.963
- Good family.
- Okay. it wasn't like that.

161
00:08:35.996 --> 00:08:37.298
It was self-defense.

162
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.168
You even got the black
chick vouching for you.

163
00:08:40.201 --> 00:08:42.037
- That's cute.
- Okay. who the fuck are you?

164
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:46.375
Hey. tell me something.
do you get like a prize

165
00:08:46.408 --> 00:08:48.342
for every brother you
kill or something.

166
00:08:48.375 --> 00:08:50.444
or like a cake.
or like stickers.

167
00:08:50.477 --> 00:08:52.346
How many niggas do
you have to kill-

168
00:08:52.379 --> 00:08:54.482
- You motherfucker!
- Get the fuck off me!

169
00:08:57.219 --> 00:08:58.854
Fuck you. man!

170
00:09:00.455 --> 00:09:01.355
- What?
- Fuck you!

171
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:02.524
What? Hey. what's wrong?

172
00:09:02.557 --> 00:09:04.225
- What's wrong?
- You weren't there!

173
00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:05.527
- What's wrong with you?
- Fuck you. motherfucker!

174
00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:07.361
- We all on the same team.
- Hey. hey!

175
00:09:07.394 --> 00:09:08.930
He's an asshole. all
right? He wasn't there.

176
00:09:08.964 --> 00:09:10.165
He wasn't. He doesn't
know what happened.

177
00:09:10.197 --> 00:09:11.198
Fuck you!
You weren't there!

178
00:09:11.232 --> 00:09:12.466
- You weren't there!
- Hey. he wasn't. all right?

179
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.467
Let it go.

180
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.102
Come on.

181
00:09:15.135 --> 00:09:16.304
- Listen to your girl. huh?
- Chill the fuck out!

182
00:09:16.337 --> 00:09:17.905
Come on. Chill the fuck out.

183
00:09:17.938 --> 00:09:18.573
Bishop!

184
00:09:21.342 --> 00:09:22.343
Bye. hero.

185
00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:39.194
What a day.

186
00:09:41.129 --> 00:09:43.331
You've been here a week.
and you didn't tell me?

187
00:09:44.331 --> 00:09:45.835
Nice place. right?

188
00:09:48.937 --> 00:09:51.273
You can't keep
pulling this shit. man.

189
00:09:53.908 --> 00:09:55.443
Fuck it. give me one of those.

190
00:09:58.446 --> 00:10:00.282
Just...

191
00:10:00.315 --> 00:10:01.483
Gonna be good.

192
00:10:06.587 --> 00:10:08.289
What was it this time?

193
00:10:10.225 --> 00:10:11.125
It's always the same.

194
00:10:11.158 --> 00:10:13.461
You know. Jan doesn't get it.

195
00:10:13.495 --> 00:10:14.363
Get what?

196
00:10:15.462 --> 00:10:17.265
Us.

197
00:10:17.298 --> 00:10:18.132
Our job.

198
00:10:19.033 --> 00:10:20.336
The law. what we do.

199
00:10:22.336 --> 00:10:25.307
She just wants to find
the good in everyone.

200
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.076
She wants to fix everyone.

201
00:10:30.577 --> 00:10:33.414
Well. you married
a social worker.

202
00:10:33.447 --> 00:10:34.449
What do you expect?

203
00:10:36.451 --> 00:10:38.320
Don't opposites attract?

204
00:10:39.553 --> 00:10:41.890
You're asking a lesbian
if opposites attract?

205
00:10:48.363 --> 00:10:49.431
- Yeah.
- Look. all I know

206
00:10:49.464 --> 00:10:51.099
is you gotta stop.

207
00:10:51.131 --> 00:10:52.400
You can't keep
pulling this shit.

208
00:10:52.433 --> 00:10:53.601
I mean. one of these days.
she's gonna smarten up

209
00:10:53.634 --> 00:10:54.702
and she's gonna leave your ass.

210
00:10:54.735 --> 00:10:56.337
Then what?

211
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.405
Yeah. I know.

212
00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:01.410
You know? Then what
the fuck are you doing?

213
00:11:02.644 --> 00:11:06.447
I mean. you gotta fix
it. make it right.

214
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:48.350
Hey!

215
00:12:48.383 --> 00:12:50.652
Knock it off before
we call the police!

216
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:55.524
I am the fucking police!

217
00:13:31.525 --> 00:13:33.627
I'm sorry. Fuck.

218
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.595
Hey. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa.

219
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:36.532
Bishop. What are you doing here?

220
00:13:38.332 --> 00:13:39.533
I just wanted to
talk to Sergeant Ward.

221
00:13:39.567 --> 00:13:43.105
That's not a good idea. all
right? He's busy right now.

222
00:13:43.138 --> 00:13:44.339
Fine.

223
00:13:44.371 --> 00:13:46.274
I just wanna look
at my report again.

224
00:13:46.307 --> 00:13:49.443
You're fucking
wasted. Go home.

225
00:13:49.476 --> 00:13:50.578
Okay? Please.

226
00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:53.714
Why?

227
00:14:02.557 --> 00:14:04.759
Excuse me
for just a moment.

228
00:14:07.928 --> 00:14:10.231
Take them to my office.

229
00:14:10.264 --> 00:14:11.399
What's going on?

230
00:14:11.432 --> 00:14:12.366
What are you
doing here. Bishop?

231
00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:14.401
I thought I was clear yesterday.

232
00:14:14.434 --> 00:14:16.770
You need to take some time.

233
00:14:26.181 --> 00:14:26.815
Lucy.

234
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.485
Lucy.

235
00:14:30.518 --> 00:14:31.887
Lucy. is that him?

236
00:14:34.721 --> 00:14:36.524
Is that him?

237
00:14:36.557 --> 00:14:38.426
Is that the man that
killed my husband?

238
00:14:38.458 --> 00:14:40.494
- Mrs. Hughes. listen to me.
- No. no.

239
00:14:40.528 --> 00:14:41.529
Is that him?

240
00:14:42.529 --> 00:14:44.632
- I wanna talk to him!
- Okay.

241
00:14:44.666 --> 00:14:45.467
- I wanna talk to you.
- No. no. no.

242
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.768
- Go. you should go.
- Okay. listen-

243
00:14:46.801 --> 00:14:48.470
- You killed Andre!
- I know.

244
00:14:48.503 --> 00:14:50.172
- You killed my husband!
- Be careful. wait. wait.

245
00:14:50.205 --> 00:14:51.773
He's the one who killed Andre!

246
00:14:51.806 --> 00:14:53.307
I know.
I know. I know.

247
00:14:53.341 --> 00:14:54.709
I wanna talk to him!

248
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:56.810
Why did you do
it?! I wanna know!

249
00:14:56.844 --> 00:14:59.848
Why did you come in my
house and kill my husband?!

250
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.183
I wanna know! I wanna know!

251
00:15:02.216 --> 00:15:04.586
- Let's go in-
- ROSIE: I wanna know.

252
00:15:04.619 --> 00:15:05.420
Wait. come on now.

253
00:15:05.452 --> 00:15:07.254
Come on. let's go in.

254
00:15:07.288 --> 00:15:09.890
Now. listen. I've got a
family in mourning over there.

255
00:15:09.923 --> 00:15:11.893
I can't have you here
right. you understand?

256
00:15:11.926 --> 00:15:14.528
I've got to get back
and sort this all out.

257
00:15:14.562 --> 00:15:16.632
You go home and get some rest.

258
00:15:28.308 --> 00:15:29.610
- Are you defending him?
- No. ma'am.

259
00:15:29.644 --> 00:15:30.678
No.

260
00:15:31.613 --> 00:15:33.615
That man murdered my husband.

261
00:15:33.648 --> 00:15:35.350
Ma'am. ma'am. please.

262
00:15:35.383 --> 00:15:36.785
Don't touch me.

263
00:15:36.817 --> 00:15:38.452
If you would just
take your seat.

264
00:15:38.485 --> 00:15:39.987
Just take your seat.
we'll talk. we'll talk.

265
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.355
Officer Wilkins.

266
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:42.624
- you can step out.
- Hey. what do you know?

267
00:15:42.657 --> 00:15:43.425
Rosie.
wait. Wait. Rosie.

268
00:15:43.457 --> 00:15:44.658
Sis. what do you know?

269
00:15:44.692 --> 00:15:45.525
You have to tell
me what you know.

270
00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:47.761
Look. can you tell
me what you know?

271
00:15:47.794 --> 00:15:49.396
- Please?
- Let her go. come on now.

272
00:15:49.429 --> 00:15:51.232
Come on. Sit down.

273
00:15:51.265 --> 00:15:51.899
Sit down.

274
00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:54.668
Sit down. now.

275
00:15:54.701 --> 00:15:56.205
All right. All right.

276
00:16:01.442 --> 00:16:03.778
I'm terribly
sorry for your loss.

277
00:16:04.778 --> 00:16:06.280
We want to be completely

278
00:16:06.313 --> 00:16:07.848
- transparent.
- You don't get to be sorry.

279
00:16:09.417 --> 00:16:13.655
Tell me why your officers
were at my house.

280
00:16:16.624 --> 00:16:19.461
They were responding
to a hostage call

281
00:16:19.494 --> 00:16:20.963
from your residence.

282
00:16:22.596 --> 00:16:25.866
Now. the footage from
my officer's body camera

283
00:16:25.899 --> 00:16:30.437
showed your husband
with a broken bottle

284
00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:34.009
exiting the backdoor where
the altercation took place.

285
00:16:34.042 --> 00:16:35.410
Altercation?

286
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.678
Altercation?

287
00:16:37.711 --> 00:16:40.881
You mean the one where
my husband was killed?

288
00:16:41.916 --> 00:16:43.685
I wanna hear it.

289
00:16:43.717 --> 00:16:44.685
I wanna hear that tape!

290
00:16:44.719 --> 00:16:46.354
That was not Andre!

291
00:16:46.386 --> 00:16:48.555
That's not what happened!

292
00:16:48.589 --> 00:16:49.758
You can ask my...

293
00:16:51.893 --> 00:16:52.927
You can ask my daughter.

294
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.796
She was there the whole...

295
00:16:56.931 --> 00:16:59.301
She was there the whole time.

296
00:17:01.668 --> 00:17:03.804
This is
what we talked about.

297
00:17:04.872 --> 00:17:05.707
Okay?

298
00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:10.611
No.

299
00:17:10.644 --> 00:17:11.779
No. no! Come on!

300
00:17:12.913 --> 00:17:13.882
Get up. get up. get up.

301
00:17:13.914 --> 00:17:15.817
Come on. You got it. you got it.

302
00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:16.683
No.

303
00:17:16.718 --> 00:17:19.019
Fire this guy.

304
00:17:19.053 --> 00:17:20.555
Come on.

305
00:17:20.587 --> 00:17:21.955
Yeah. that's it. Come
on. let's get it.

306
00:17:21.989 --> 00:17:23.758
Let's get it. let's get it.

307
00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.726
Ah. shit. Come on.

308
00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:27.895
Language. Daddy.

309
00:17:27.929 --> 00:17:29.464
I'm sorry. baby.

310
00:17:30.397 --> 00:17:31.865
Hey. it's 8:30.

311
00:17:31.898 --> 00:17:33.634
Gonna get your schoolwork done?

312
00:17:33.667 --> 00:17:35.069
It's all done.

313
00:17:35.103 --> 00:17:37.672
Okay. well. go on
up and get it out

314
00:17:37.704 --> 00:17:39.607
so your mom can check
it in the morning. okay?

315
00:17:40.775 --> 00:17:42.744
And brush your teeth.

316
00:17:42.777 --> 00:17:43.812
It's almost time for bed.

317
00:17:46.646 --> 00:17:47.816
Hey.

318
00:17:47.848 --> 00:17:48.916
Don't play me now.

319
00:17:53.855 --> 00:17:55.089
Come on. Hustle.

320
00:17:56.857 --> 00:17:57.925
And he will be
the lead blocker for Hughes.

321
00:17:57.959 --> 00:17:58.893
He's got breakaway speed!

322
00:17:58.925 --> 00:17:59.894
Bye-bye.

323
00:18:02.028 --> 00:18:03.832
No. it's okay. baby.

324
00:18:03.865 --> 00:18:05.967
Daddy just got excited.

325
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.369
I'll be up after I
throw this mess outside.

326
00:18:08.403 --> 00:18:09.703
Over eight points

327
00:18:09.737 --> 00:18:12.474
defensively here
in the four games

328
00:18:12.507 --> 00:18:14.875
that have led to this
six-eight championship.

329
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.678
Oh. come on.

330
00:18:19.614 --> 00:18:21.016
Somebody's gonna get killed!

331
00:18:24.719 --> 00:18:25.987
This playbook is trash!

332
00:18:30.791 --> 00:18:32.093
What are you doing?!

333
00:18:41.501 --> 00:18:42.971
Get your ass up. now!

334
00:18:53.013 --> 00:18:53.814
Police.
get on the fucking-

335
00:19:09.497 --> 00:19:10.132
Dad?

336
00:19:18.972 --> 00:19:19.807
Dad?

337
00:19:37.657 --> 00:19:38.492
Dad?

338
00:19:49.202 --> 00:19:50.738
- Dad.
- Shots fired.

339
00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.105
Let me see
your fucking hands.

340
00:19:52.138 --> 00:19:54.675
Repeat. shots
fired. Suspect down.

341
00:19:54.709 --> 00:19:56.644
Request for an
ambulance immediately.

342
00:19:57.845 --> 00:19:58.913
Give me your
other fucking hand. now!

343
00:19:58.945 --> 00:20:00.147
Give it to me!

344
00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:02.250
Turn around. Give
me your other hand!

345
00:20:06.887 --> 00:20:08.155
- Let's go. in every closet!
- Check upstairs.

346
00:20:08.189 --> 00:20:09.891
- Suspect down.
- Get her outta there!

347
00:20:09.923 --> 00:20:11.460
Get the girl.

348
00:20:45.692 --> 00:20:46.494
Hey.

349
00:20:47.894 --> 00:20:48.962
How's it going?

350
00:20:48.996 --> 00:20:50.999
Fucking great.

351
00:20:51.031 --> 00:20:52.933
Right. Sorry.

352
00:20:52.967 --> 00:20:54.069
What's up?

353
00:20:58.806 --> 00:21:02.143
They brought in the girl to
give an official statement.

354
00:21:04.077 --> 00:21:06.647
They wanna open up
an investigation.

355
00:21:06.681 --> 00:21:09.150
Investigation? Into what?

356
00:21:09.182 --> 00:21:12.052
The wife says it
doesn't make sense.

357
00:21:12.086 --> 00:21:13.153
There were no hostages.

358
00:21:13.186 --> 00:21:15.055
She says she was at the
hospital visiting a friend.

359
00:21:15.088 --> 00:21:17.057
He was the perfect husband.

360
00:21:18.159 --> 00:21:20.328
What did the girl say?

361
00:21:20.361 --> 00:21:22.697
She said she was upstairs.

362
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.033
You heard her
scream. though. right?

363
00:21:25.066 --> 00:21:27.201
Yeah. Yeah. I heard her.

364
00:21:27.233 --> 00:21:29.202
Okay. so why was he on
the porch with a bottle?

365
00:21:29.236 --> 00:21:30.972
I mean. can they explain that?

366
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.076
He broke the bottle
watching the game.

367
00:21:37.944 --> 00:21:38.846
Look. I got one of the guys

368
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.082
to send over a copy
of the Hughes call.

369
00:21:41.115 --> 00:21:42.916
but you gotta delete it
after you listen to it.

370
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.219
I don't think the
family's heard it yet.

371
00:21:45.251 --> 00:21:46.620
Did you listen to it?

372
00:21:46.653 --> 00:21:48.021
Yeah.

373
00:21:48.055 --> 00:21:50.158
It's messed up.

374
00:21:50.191 --> 00:21:53.027
So you just gotta be careful
'cause it can't leak out.

375
00:21:53.059 --> 00:21:54.061
Of course.

376
00:21:54.095 --> 00:21:55.896
I just wanna know what happened.

377
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:00.000
Okay. I'm sending it now.

378
00:22:00.034 --> 00:22:01.803
Thanks
for this. all right?

379
00:22:17.652 --> 00:22:19.019
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

380
00:22:19.053 --> 00:22:21.089
Shit. Shit.

381
00:22:21.122 --> 00:22:22.657
Just try
to remain calm. sir.

382
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:23.391
What is your emergency?

383
00:22:23.423 --> 00:22:24.858
I...

384
00:22:26.093 --> 00:22:28.930
Start by giving
me your name and your address.

385
00:22:28.962 --> 00:22:30.330
Don't
tell me what to do.

386
00:22:30.364 --> 00:22:33.134
Don't you ever tell me
what do. you understand?

387
00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:35.669
Sir.
yes. I understand.

388
00:22:35.702 --> 00:22:37.137
But how can I help you?

389
00:22:37.171 --> 00:22:39.106
I won't
let her take my kids.

390
00:22:40.207 --> 00:22:41.909
She can't take them.

391
00:22:41.942 --> 00:22:42.876
They're mine.

392
00:22:43.877 --> 00:22:45.846
Sir. I need
to know where you are

393
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.416
so that I can send help.

394
00:22:48.449 --> 00:22:51.219
14
Independence Square.

395
00:22:51.251 --> 00:22:53.253
I'll shoot her if she leaves.

396
00:22:53.287 --> 00:22:55.355
You have to stop her.

397
00:22:55.388 --> 00:22:58.825
If she tries to take my
kids. I'll fucking kill her.

398
00:22:58.858 --> 00:23:00.827
Where are you now?

399
00:23:00.861 --> 00:23:02.096
In the kitchen.

400
00:23:02.128 --> 00:23:04.197
Okay.
And where is she?

401
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.799
In the closet.

402
00:23:08.368 --> 00:23:10.003
Are you sending someone?

403
00:23:10.037 --> 00:23:11.405
Yes. officers
have been dispatched.

404
00:23:11.439 --> 00:23:13.374
Now. I'm gonna-

405
00:23:35.962 --> 00:23:37.764
Police are
expected to make a statement

406
00:23:37.798 --> 00:23:39.333
tomorrow on the incident
that took the life

407
00:23:39.365 --> 00:23:42.936
of local football
coach Andre Hughes.

408
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.038
Police received a distressed
call that brought them

409
00:23:45.071 --> 00:23:47.274
to the Hughes residence
just after 9:00 p.m..

410
00:23:47.307 --> 00:23:49.109
when an altercation began.

411
00:23:49.143 --> 00:23:52.346
resulting in the death of the
well-respected football coach.

412
00:23:53.748 --> 00:23:56.084
He is survived by
his wife Rosie Hughes

413
00:23:56.116 --> 00:23:57.085
and their daughter Lucy.

414
00:23:57.117 --> 00:24:00.154
as well as his parents
Gayle and Albert Hughes.

415
00:24:02.123 --> 00:24:04.225
When we return. we'll
go to Alison Wade

416
00:24:04.258 --> 00:24:06.795
who was with the Hughes
family earlier today.

417
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.441
I've covered a lot of
stories on the school

418
00:24:20.473 --> 00:24:24.178
and... Andre over the years.

419
00:24:25.512 --> 00:24:27.281
He was such a kind man.

420
00:24:29.784 --> 00:24:31.486
So sorry for your loss.

421
00:24:33.854 --> 00:24:34.489
Okay.

422
00:24:40.094 --> 00:24:41.195
Ready?

423
00:24:41.228 --> 00:24:42.063
Yeah.

424
00:24:43.963 --> 00:24:45.332
Whenever you're ready.

425
00:24:50.104 --> 00:24:51.338
Andre Hughes

426
00:24:55.276 --> 00:24:59.346
was a loving husband and father.

427
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.284
He was the light of our family

428
00:25:04.951 --> 00:25:08.256
and he was a part of this
community his entire life.

429
00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.759
I want answers.

430
00:25:13.259 --> 00:25:16.196
We all lost a great
man last night.

431
00:25:17.463 --> 00:25:19.267
and I wanna know why.

432
00:25:20.968 --> 00:25:22.504
Andre loved everyone.

433
00:25:24.939 --> 00:25:26.775
and everyone loved him.

434
00:25:28.608 --> 00:25:33.781
Why was my husband murdered
by the police in his own home?

435
00:25:37.317 --> 00:25:38.252
Is that him?

436
00:25:39.886 --> 00:25:41.355
Lucy. is that him?

437
00:25:42.623 --> 00:25:44.991
Is that the man that
killed my husband?

438
00:25:45.025 --> 00:25:46.994
- Mrs. Hughes. listen to me.
- No. no.

439
00:25:47.027 --> 00:25:47.961
Is that him?

440
00:26:35.643 --> 00:26:38.278
Hey. it's Wilkins.

441
00:26:38.311 --> 00:26:40.247
You gotta come in.

442
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.983
Sergeant Ward needs
to talk to you.

443
00:26:43.017 --> 00:26:44.285
It's urgent.

444
00:26:55.561 --> 00:26:57.230
We want justice!

445
00:26:57.263 --> 00:26:58.498
We want justice!

446
00:26:58.531 --> 00:27:00.134
We want justice!

447
00:27:00.166 --> 00:27:01.301
We want justice!

448
00:27:01.335 --> 00:27:03.337
We want justice!

449
00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:06.007
We want justice!

450
00:27:07.441 --> 00:27:08.977
We want justice!

451
00:27:10.477 --> 00:27:12.013
We want justice!

452
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.115
Did you
see everyone outside?

453
00:27:15.148 --> 00:27:16.950
Yeah. there have
been suits here all day.

454
00:27:16.983 --> 00:27:18.451
Fuck.

455
00:27:18.484 --> 00:27:20.288
Look. I know Sergeant
Ward wants to talk to you.

456
00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.924
but they're not telling
me what's going on.

457
00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:27.961
They think I shot him
because he was black.

458
00:27:29.395 --> 00:27:31.298
I shot him because
I felt threatened.

459
00:27:31.332 --> 00:27:33.334
because I was doing
my fucking job.

460
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.637
Yeah. I know.

461
00:27:37.671 --> 00:27:42.977
But listen. man. they're tired
of being seen as a threat.

462
00:27:44.411 --> 00:27:46.514
I mean. they wanna know
were you threatened by him

463
00:27:47.548 --> 00:27:49.182
or what he looks like.

464
00:27:51.518 --> 00:27:53.020
You get that. right?

465
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.522
Are you saying I'm a racist?

466
00:27:55.556 --> 00:27:56.356
Did I say that?

467
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:57.992
- Did I say that?
- No. what the fuck

468
00:27:58.025 --> 00:27:59.093
are you saying. then. Wilkins-

469
00:27:59.125 --> 00:28:00.327
Good morning.

470
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:02.530
- Morning. sir.
- Hey. Sarge.

471
00:28:02.563 --> 00:28:05.967
Officer Wilkins. could we
speak with Bishop alone. please?

472
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.934
Yes. sir.

473
00:28:09.569 --> 00:28:12.605
This is Mr. Smith. He's
the department lawyer.

474
00:28:12.638 --> 00:28:13.974
- Morning.
- Will.

475
00:28:14.008 --> 00:28:14.607
Morning.

476
00:28:14.641 --> 00:28:16.110
Okay. Please.

477
00:28:23.017 --> 00:28:24.485
Bishop. are you all right?

478
00:28:25.551 --> 00:28:27.387
I didn't expect any of this.

479
00:28:28.521 --> 00:28:30.390
You responded to

480
00:28:30.423 --> 00:28:33.527
a distress call about
a violent situation

481
00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:35.495
and you acted with bravery.

482
00:28:37.698 --> 00:28:41.769
Not many people realize the
burdens we volunteer for

483
00:28:41.801 --> 00:28:45.205
when we take on
this job every day.

484
00:28:45.239 --> 00:28:49.344
It's a heroic responsibility
just to put on a badge.

485
00:28:50.477 --> 00:28:55.483
Now. we received some disturbing
information this morning

486
00:28:56.717 --> 00:29:00.321
and we're still
investigating its legitimacy.

487
00:29:00.354 --> 00:29:02.155
But I wanted to
sit down with you.

488
00:29:02.189 --> 00:29:03.758
give you the news first.

489
00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:07.461
so that I can answer any
questions you may have.

490
00:29:09.496 --> 00:29:11.332
An email came in.

491
00:29:11.365 --> 00:29:16.170
It contained a recording of
some people playing video games

492
00:29:16.202 --> 00:29:18.605
the night of the Hughes call.

493
00:29:18.638 --> 00:29:20.040
Went on for hours.

494
00:29:20.074 --> 00:29:22.343
There are pages and
pages of arguments

495
00:29:22.375 --> 00:29:24.112
in the transcriptions here.

496
00:29:25.546 --> 00:29:28.215
At first. it made no sense.

497
00:29:28.248 --> 00:29:31.585
but then one of the players

498
00:29:31.617 --> 00:29:34.588
threatened to send a SWAT
team to someone's house.

499
00:29:36.256 --> 00:29:39.593
That address was 14
Independence Square.

500
00:29:44.765 --> 00:29:46.667
I just don't understand

501
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.836
- how assholes these days-
- You know.

502
00:29:49.869 --> 00:29:52.305
I know this is a lot to take in.

503
00:29:52.338 --> 00:29:53.540
but what's important to remember

504
00:29:53.574 --> 00:29:55.643
are the facts of the situation.

505
00:29:58.644 --> 00:30:00.346
Take a look at that.

506
00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.215
Now.

507
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.387
from the footage.
from your body cam.

508
00:30:07.421 --> 00:30:09.355
Andre Hughes was
angry that night

509
00:30:09.388 --> 00:30:11.758
when he came through
the door at you.

510
00:30:11.791 --> 00:30:15.161
You and Officer
Wilkins both reported

511
00:30:15.194 --> 00:30:17.564
hearing the shattering
of glass inside the house

512
00:30:17.597 --> 00:30:19.866
and a girl's scream.

513
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.869
As you secured a perimeter.

514
00:30:21.902 --> 00:30:24.672
you encountered the
suspect at the door

515
00:30:24.704 --> 00:30:27.807
holding a broken
bottle in his hand.

516
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.644
You announced yourself
as a police officer

517
00:30:30.676 --> 00:30:34.115
and instructed him to get
on the ground. correct?

518
00:30:36.583 --> 00:30:37.485
Mr. Bishop?

519
00:30:38.551 --> 00:30:39.352
Yes.

520
00:30:40.686 --> 00:30:42.789
He
disobeyed those orders

521
00:30:42.823 --> 00:30:45.192
and threw the bottle at you.

522
00:30:45.224 --> 00:30:48.495
causing you to fire
at the suspect.

523
00:30:48.528 --> 00:30:49.564
Is that correct?

524
00:30:50.931 --> 00:30:52.165
Officer Bishop?

525
00:30:53.634 --> 00:30:55.169
Officer Bishop.
these are the facts

526
00:30:55.201 --> 00:30:57.505
that we must be very clear
about before your hearing.

527
00:30:57.538 --> 00:30:58.673
do you understand?

528
00:31:01.407 --> 00:31:03.144
Jesus Christ.

529
00:31:05.479 --> 00:31:06.680
I'm sorry. Sergeant.

530
00:31:06.712 --> 00:31:08.148
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

531
00:31:08.182 --> 00:31:09.549
It's okay.

532
00:31:09.583 --> 00:31:13.187
It's okay. Let me go get
something to clean this up.

533
00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.387
It's all right.

534
00:31:14.421 --> 00:31:15.823
It's all right.
I'll be right back.

535
00:32:18.852 --> 00:32:20.621
Oh. Excuse me. Sergeant. sir.

536
00:32:20.653 --> 00:32:22.556
Can you tell me what's going on?

537
00:32:22.588 --> 00:32:24.692
Like. what's the
suit doing here?

538
00:32:24.724 --> 00:32:26.659
We got an email.

539
00:32:26.692 --> 00:32:28.295
The call was faked.

540
00:32:28.327 --> 00:32:29.797
Some assholes online.

541
00:32:31.798 --> 00:32:34.701
Jesus Christ. We got swatted?

542
00:32:34.734 --> 00:32:36.269
What did Bishop say?

543
00:32:36.303 --> 00:32:37.504
Nothing yet.

544
00:32:37.537 --> 00:32:38.972
He got sick.

545
00:32:39.006 --> 00:32:40.841
Oh. my god. how is
this even possible?

546
00:32:40.874 --> 00:32:42.343
How does this happen?

547
00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.278
I don't know.

548
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.645
People are fucked.

549
00:32:50.916 --> 00:32:51.718
Shit!

550
00:32:53.053 --> 00:32:54.955
I'll go check the parking lot.

551
00:32:54.988 --> 00:32:56.824
God dammit. Bishop.

552
00:32:56.856 --> 00:32:59.726
This is a big liability
for the department. Sergeant.

553
00:32:59.759 --> 00:33:01.628
Those news stations are
growing out there too.

554
00:33:01.662 --> 00:33:03.663
This guy was a local legend.

555
00:33:03.696 --> 00:33:06.599
You need to make Bishop understand
he acted in self-defense.

556
00:33:06.633 --> 00:33:07.534
Get him in line.

557
00:33:07.567 --> 00:33:09.002
This can't look like blindfire.

558
00:33:09.036 --> 00:33:11.639
If not for him. for the
rest of the department.

559
00:33:11.672 --> 00:33:12.873
He needs to be at
that hearing next week

560
00:33:12.905 --> 00:33:14.741
and he needs to
have it together.

561
00:33:19.945 --> 00:33:21.714
He's gone. sir.

562
00:33:21.748 --> 00:33:22.816
They said he
grabbed a few things

563
00:33:22.848 --> 00:33:24.817
from his desk and took off.

564
00:33:24.851 --> 00:33:25.853
Did he talk to anyone?

565
00:33:25.885 --> 00:33:26.819
No. sir.

566
00:33:26.853 --> 00:33:29.456
Oh. God dammit. Bishop.

567
00:33:29.489 --> 00:33:32.492
If he's AWOL. I can't
do anything to help him.

568
00:33:32.526 --> 00:33:33.760
Well. I'll go find him.

569
00:33:33.794 --> 00:33:35.461
No. no. no. no.
no. no. Stay here.

570
00:33:35.494 --> 00:33:36.663
We need you here.

571
00:33:36.696 --> 00:33:38.331
Have you seen that
crowd outside?

572
00:33:38.365 --> 00:33:39.599
It's getting bigger.

573
00:33:40.933 --> 00:33:42.002
I understand.

574
00:33:45.372 --> 00:33:46.307
Dammit.

575
00:33:48.875 --> 00:33:51.444
Come on. Bishop.

576
00:34:07.827 --> 00:34:08.728
Hi. you've reached

577
00:34:08.762 --> 00:34:09.964
- Will Bishop.
- Shit.

578
00:34:14.634 --> 00:34:15.836
Hi. you've
reached Will Bishop.

579
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:16.702
Son of a bitch.

580
00:34:16.737 --> 00:34:18.372
I can't
get to the phone.

581
00:34:18.405 --> 00:34:19.840
so leave a message and
I'll get back to you.

582
00:34:19.873 --> 00:34:21.508
Thanks.

583
00:34:21.541 --> 00:34:22.843
Bishop. it's me.

584
00:34:24.577 --> 00:34:25.878
Come on. man. you
gotta talk to me.

585
00:34:25.911 --> 00:34:27.714
You gotta talk to me. okay?

586
00:34:29.416 --> 00:34:31.852
I know what kinda cop you are.

587
00:34:32.918 --> 00:34:33.853
I know you.

588
00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:38.693
We can work this out together.
but you gotta call me.

589
00:34:52.838 --> 00:34:54.541
- Hi.
- Hey. it's Wilkins.

590
00:34:54.574 --> 00:34:55.876
What's going on?

591
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:57.845
I need your help.

592
00:34:57.878 --> 00:34:59.847
Yeah. there's people gathering

593
00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.081
outside of our house with signs.

594
00:35:01.114 --> 00:35:03.916
They have been
for the last hour.

595
00:35:03.949 --> 00:35:05.418
I've called Will.
he's not answering.

596
00:35:05.452 --> 00:35:06.420
What's going on?

597
00:35:06.452 --> 00:35:07.688
I can't get ahold of Will.

598
00:35:07.721 --> 00:35:08.956
He just left the station and-

599
00:35:08.989 --> 00:35:10.757
- We want justice!
- Jan?

600
00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:12.059
- We want justice!
- Jan?

601
00:36:08.047 --> 00:36:09.048
ChayMoney.

602
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:31.998
As tensions
rise in the community.

603
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:35.701
we go live to Alison Wade who
is at the police precinct.

604
00:37:35.735 --> 00:37:37.704
- Alison?
- Want justice!

605
00:37:37.737 --> 00:37:39.139
We want justice!

606
00:37:39.172 --> 00:37:40.907
We want justice!

607
00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.009
- We want justice!
- The protest remains peaceful

608
00:37:43.043 --> 00:37:46.113
as the numbers continue to grow
outside the police station.

609
00:37:46.146 --> 00:37:48.815
Students have been arriving
wearing football jerseys

610
00:37:48.847 --> 00:37:51.985
and the schools colors
in support of the coach.

611
00:37:56.222 --> 00:37:57.891
Yo. flank left.

612
00:37:57.923 --> 00:37:58.692
I don't know if I
have it. They're right there.

613
00:37:58.724 --> 00:37:59.927
They're right there.

614
00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:00.860
Yo. I'm
coming. I'm coming.

615
00:38:00.893 --> 00:38:02.094
You get the drop.

616
00:38:02.128 --> 00:38:03.329
Where's
the other team?

617
00:38:03.362 --> 00:38:04.897
Look at tunnels. Take
the stairs. take the stairs.

618
00:38:04.931 --> 00:38:07.034
What are
you doing? Come on.

619
00:38:07.067 --> 00:38:08.568
Ah. shit.

620
00:38:08.601 --> 00:38:09.836
God dammit.

621
00:38:11.003 --> 00:38:12.204
Yo. this guy sucks.

622
00:38:12.237 --> 00:38:13.973
Hello? Hello?

623
00:38:14.007 --> 00:38:15.041
Hello.

624
00:38:16.009 --> 00:38:17.144
Can you hear me?

625
00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:20.580
- Hello?
- Yo. who is this guy?

626
00:38:20.614 --> 00:38:23.050
I'm looking for
ChayMoney. You know him?

627
00:38:23.083 --> 00:38:23.951
Piss off.

628
00:38:25.251 --> 00:38:29.356
I'm looking for
ChayMoney or the Grinch.

629
00:38:29.389 --> 00:38:30.958
You know where they are?

630
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.193
Yo. quit the
game. you fucking noob.

631
00:38:33.226 --> 00:38:36.096
Hey. can you just
tell me where they are?

632
00:38:36.128 --> 00:38:38.998
Are you joking? This
is the internet. you pleb.

633
00:38:39.032 --> 00:38:41.367
Hey. man. I'm in the
middle of a game with them.

634
00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.169
so can you just tell
me where to find them?

635
00:38:43.202 --> 00:38:44.971
Oh. my
god. this guy sucks.

636
00:38:45.005 --> 00:38:47.007
Hey. grandpa. go
back to the main menu

637
00:38:47.039 --> 00:38:48.608
and add them to
your friends list.

638
00:38:52.177 --> 00:38:54.313
Thanks. Thanks. man.

639
00:39:23.208 --> 00:39:24.243
Fuck.

640
00:39:54.139 --> 00:39:55.842
Wolverine Nation!

641
00:39:55.875 --> 00:39:58.411
I wanna thank everyone for
your support this season.

642
00:39:58.445 --> 00:40:01.014
Coaching football has
always been a dream of mine

643
00:40:01.047 --> 00:40:02.081
and that's a dream
that comes with both

644
00:40:02.114 --> 00:40:04.350
the wins and the losses.

645
00:40:04.384 --> 00:40:05.751
Now. we may have
come up short today.

646
00:40:05.784 --> 00:40:07.253
but I want you to
know this is a season

647
00:40:07.286 --> 00:40:10.056
I will never forget. okay?

648
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:11.792
I can only hope
that when the pain

649
00:40:11.824 --> 00:40:13.393
of tonight's game wears off.

650
00:40:13.425 --> 00:40:14.827
that each and every one of you

651
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.163
has as many fond
memories as I do.

652
00:40:17.197 --> 00:40:19.932
I want every one of these
young men to understand

653
00:40:19.965 --> 00:40:22.768
the impact they've had on
me. on their teammates.

654
00:40:22.802 --> 00:40:24.037
the impact on the other students

655
00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:25.338
and the whole
community around them.

656
00:40:25.371 --> 00:40:27.106
and on the memories
that you created

657
00:40:27.139 --> 00:40:29.710
that we will cherish
for a lifetime.

658
00:40:29.742 --> 00:40:31.344
Hey. cupcake.

659
00:40:31.376 --> 00:40:32.211
Come here.

660
00:40:33.246 --> 00:40:35.248
You wanna say something?

661
00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.085
- Go Wolverines!
- Go Wolverines!

662
00:41:35.974 --> 00:41:38.010
Hey. it's me.

663
00:41:38.043 --> 00:41:39.980
Wilkins told me
where to find you.

664
00:41:43.416 --> 00:41:44.785
Come on.

665
00:41:44.818 --> 00:41:45.552
Let me in.

666
00:41:45.585 --> 00:41:47.019
Your car's in the parking lot

667
00:41:47.052 --> 00:41:49.021
and I can smell the
cigarettes from here.

668
00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:56.496
I'll stay out here all
night if I have to.

669
00:42:00.199 --> 00:42:01.400
What are you doing here?

670
00:42:03.036 --> 00:42:04.838
I love you
and I wanna help.

671
00:42:06.338 --> 00:42:08.275
You can't fix this one. Jan.

672
00:42:12.277 --> 00:42:13.279
Please let me in.

673
00:42:19.318 --> 00:42:20.153
I can't.

674
00:42:24.923 --> 00:42:25.559
Okay.

675
00:42:29.094 --> 00:42:31.130
Okay. then we can
talk like this.

676
00:42:44.077 --> 00:42:47.347
Do you remember when we
first started dating.

677
00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.883
and we'd just would.
like. drive circles

678
00:42:49.916 --> 00:42:51.585
around the city
with nowhere to be?

679
00:42:55.454 --> 00:42:58.357
You know. those were some
of my favorite nights.

680
00:42:58.391 --> 00:43:00.126
Yeah. you know. stick it to him.

681
00:43:01.527 --> 00:43:04.431
Makes me feel better about
sleeping my comfortable bed.

682
00:43:04.463 --> 00:43:05.865
Where are we going?

683
00:43:05.898 --> 00:43:08.434
I told you. Just trust me.

684
00:43:08.467 --> 00:43:10.403
This guy is the best.

685
00:43:12.271 --> 00:43:14.974
You always had some
local hero or urban legend

686
00:43:15.007 --> 00:43:16.876
you couldn't wait to show me.

687
00:43:20.579 --> 00:43:22.215
- Hey.
- Hey.

688
00:43:22.248 --> 00:43:24.384
- What's up?
- What's up. man?

689
00:43:24.416 --> 00:43:26.119
Officer Bishop.

690
00:43:26.152 --> 00:43:28.889
This is Jan.
this is my friend Jan.

691
00:43:28.922 --> 00:43:31.391
What did I do to
deserve you two tonight. huh?

692
00:43:33.059 --> 00:43:35.428
It was like the world
wasn't a dark place anymore

693
00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:36.395
'cause you had this light

694
00:43:36.429 --> 00:43:39.066
that made everybody
else around you shine.

695
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.302
- He's a musician hot dog man.
- Why'd you come here?

696
00:43:42.335 --> 00:43:44.438
- Yeah.
- For a dog and a song.

697
00:43:46.505 --> 00:43:48.375
And that's the man
I fell in love with.

698
00:43:53.211 --> 00:43:57.317
♪ Hot dogs and whiskey
makes me feel frisky ♪

699
00:43:57.349 --> 00:44:00.987
♪ Holding her hand
on a Saturday night ♪

700
00:44:01.019 --> 00:44:05.190
♪ Said hot dogs and whiskey.
maybe she'll kiss me ♪

701
00:44:05.224 --> 00:44:08.961
♪ Looking into her eyes
in the cold moonlight ♪

702
00:44:13.365 --> 00:44:15.969
That's the man I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

703
00:44:18.704 --> 00:44:20.373
And I know you're still there.

704
00:44:25.244 --> 00:44:27.079
We used to stay up
all night laughing

705
00:44:27.112 --> 00:44:30.149
at each other's stories.
and now. we barely speak.

706
00:44:32.217 --> 00:44:33.585
I wanna find a way to start over

707
00:44:33.619 --> 00:44:36.389
and remember the
people we used to be.

708
00:44:38.157 --> 00:44:39.425
You never told me
your pet peeve.

709
00:44:40.559 --> 00:44:41.228
Oh. yeah. I don't have any.

710
00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.494
Come on. you must have one.

711
00:44:42.527 --> 00:44:43.629
No. I'll do it in a second.

712
00:44:48.701 --> 00:44:49.536
Will.

713
00:44:50.635 --> 00:44:52.940
Hey. hey. hey. It's a car.

714
00:44:54.306 --> 00:44:55.241
It's a car.

715
00:44:59.244 --> 00:45:01.047
I hate what this
job has done to you.

716
00:45:05.385 --> 00:45:07.520
Jan. I can't
drag you into this.

717
00:45:07.552 --> 00:45:09.556
You're not dragging me into
anything I'm not already in.

718
00:45:09.588 --> 00:45:10.990
I'm your wife.

719
00:45:11.023 --> 00:45:13.492
There's people screaming
outside of our house.

720
00:45:13.525 --> 00:45:15.494
Tell me what's going on.

721
00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:24.336
- You don't understand.
- Oh. I don't understand.

722
00:45:24.369 --> 00:45:27.007
I've been married to you for
five years. I don't understand.

723
00:45:27.039 --> 00:45:28.474
What do you want me to say?

724
00:45:28.507 --> 00:45:31.110
Don't you get it? I
don't want you here!

725
00:45:31.143 --> 00:45:32.644
You can't fix this!

726
00:45:32.677 --> 00:45:34.413
Just leave me alone.

727
00:45:38.351 --> 00:45:39.419
I love you. Will.
and you have to pull

728
00:45:39.452 --> 00:45:41.188
yourself outta this.

729
00:45:42.387 --> 00:45:44.556
If you won't talk to
me. talk to Wilkins.

730
00:45:55.501 --> 00:45:56.670
I love you too.

731
00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:23.096
Hello?

732
00:46:27.532 --> 00:46:28.601
Okay.

733
00:46:28.634 --> 00:46:30.436
Okay. okay. calm down.

734
00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:32.639
What did he say?

735
00:46:36.576 --> 00:46:38.244
No. no. no. He loves you.

736
00:46:38.277 --> 00:46:40.346
He's probably still drunk.

737
00:46:40.378 --> 00:46:42.248
Just try and let
him sleep it off.

738
00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:46.052
Yeah. we'll go together
in the morning.

739
00:46:47.652 --> 00:46:48.286
Okay?

740
00:46:51.224 --> 00:46:53.326
I'll call you in the morning.

741
00:46:53.358 --> 00:46:55.061
Try to get some rest.

742
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:12.679
Is Jan all right?

743
00:47:14.579 --> 00:47:15.514
She's a mess.

744
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:21.621
I mean. you know. the
protestors were outside

745
00:47:21.653 --> 00:47:23.657
her house all day. and then...

746
00:47:25.224 --> 00:47:28.161
This swatting thing has really
got Bishop pretty fucked up.

747
00:47:30.695 --> 00:47:31.797
What are you gonna do?

748
00:47:34.833 --> 00:47:35.868
I don't know.

749
00:47:39.405 --> 00:47:41.575
People want me choose sides.

750
00:47:45.677 --> 00:47:46.512
I can't.

751
00:47:54.253 --> 00:47:56.189
Come on. babe. let's
try to get some rest.

752
00:47:57.657 --> 00:47:58.692
Come on.

753
00:51:05.777 --> 00:51:06.913
Come on. Bishop.

754
00:51:08.947 --> 00:51:10.849
They're
up in the tower.

755
00:51:10.882 --> 00:51:11.917
Someone's gotta get
them outta there.

756
00:51:11.951 --> 00:51:13.385
We gotta get around.

757
00:51:15.153 --> 00:51:16.922
I hear voices inside.

758
00:51:16.956 --> 00:51:18.490
I'll try calling him again.

759
00:51:24.563 --> 00:51:26.800
Hey. it's Wilkins.
We're just here to help.

760
00:51:30.735 --> 00:51:32.404
He's not answering.

761
00:51:32.438 --> 00:51:34.574
He's probably passed
out. honestly.

762
00:51:45.885 --> 00:51:46.819
Listen up. everyone.

763
00:51:46.851 --> 00:51:47.920
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

764
00:51:47.952 --> 00:51:50.655
but the store will temporarily
close at this time.

765
00:51:50.688 --> 00:51:52.958
I'm here on an official
police investigation.

766
00:51:52.992 --> 00:51:54.427
so you come back in an hour.

767
00:51:56.661 --> 00:51:58.697
Sorry for the inconvenience.

768
00:51:58.731 --> 00:51:59.532
Thank you.

769
00:52:05.471 --> 00:52:07.539
I shouldn't have
left him last night.

770
00:52:21.052 --> 00:52:22.821
A suspect is still at large.

771
00:52:22.855 --> 00:52:26.025
We know his phone number
originates from this carrier.

772
00:52:26.057 --> 00:52:27.726
but I need his address.

773
00:52:28.927 --> 00:52:29.895
Now. I spoke to your supervisor

774
00:52:29.929 --> 00:52:32.030
and he said you can get
it for me no problem.

775
00:52:33.666 --> 00:52:34.534
I should call someone first.

776
00:52:34.567 --> 00:52:35.735
I've never done

777
00:52:35.768 --> 00:52:36.702
- anything like this.
- This is an emergency.

778
00:52:36.735 --> 00:52:37.670
One man is already dead.

779
00:52:37.702 --> 00:52:40.773
We don't have time. do
you understand that?

780
00:52:40.806 --> 00:52:43.074
Yeah. just give me a sec.

781
00:52:48.614 --> 00:52:50.983
Okay. the name on the
account is Beverly Miller.

782
00:53:04.163 --> 00:53:05.164
Thank you.

783
00:53:16.976 --> 00:53:18.445
What's it say?

784
00:53:21.614 --> 00:53:22.882
I wish I
could bring back the man

785
00:53:22.914 --> 00:53:24.750
you fell in love with.

786
00:53:26.684 --> 00:53:28.788
When I look in the
mirror some days.

787
00:53:29.788 --> 00:53:31.858
I see the same stranger as you.

788
00:53:35.894 --> 00:53:38.931
I'm sorry for everything I said.
I didn't mean a word of it.

789
00:53:42.635 --> 00:53:44.170
I wasn't strong enough
to open the door.

790
00:53:44.202 --> 00:53:46.139
and I'm sorry for that.

791
00:53:51.643 --> 00:53:53.044
Remember us smiling.

792
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:15.768
Ah. shit.

793
00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.202
It needs a password.

794
00:54:25.643 --> 00:54:27.546
Have you seen him
like this before?

795
00:54:30.114 --> 00:54:31.750
Drunk. yes.

796
00:54:31.784 --> 00:54:32.585
But not like this.

797
00:54:36.355 --> 00:54:38.224
Okay. you're in.

798
00:54:54.239 --> 00:54:56.108
Oh. he's looking
for the gamer.

799
00:54:57.041 --> 00:54:58.310
I gotta call this in.

800
00:54:58.344 --> 00:54:59.778
Shit.

801
00:54:59.811 --> 00:55:02.080
I'm just gonna
need an address.

802
00:55:02.114 --> 00:55:04.916
I can find him.
I can find him.

803
00:56:44.083 --> 00:56:45.184
Police Department!

804
00:56:49.987 --> 00:56:52.023
Good morning. I'm
Officer Bishop.

805
00:56:52.056 --> 00:56:53.259
Hope I didn't wake you.

806
00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.929
No. no. It's okay.

807
00:56:58.163 --> 00:57:00.132
I'm here investigating
a homicide.

808
00:57:02.768 --> 00:57:04.269
Sorry. I didn't get your name.

809
00:57:06.137 --> 00:57:07.005
Chase Miller.

810
00:57:10.141 --> 00:57:11.277
All right. Chase.

811
00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:14.313
Do you know anyone who goes
by the name of ChayMoney?

812
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:18.384
No.

813
00:57:21.286 --> 00:57:23.155
I don't.

814
00:57:23.188 --> 00:57:24.222
Sorry.

815
00:57:27.826 --> 00:57:29.028
What are you doing?! Stop!

816
00:57:29.061 --> 00:57:30.296
You
know what you did!

817
00:57:30.329 --> 00:57:31.731
- It was just a prank call.
- A prank?!

818
00:57:31.764 --> 00:57:32.832
A fucking prank?!

819
00:57:32.864 --> 00:57:33.765
I'm sorry!

820
00:57:33.798 --> 00:57:35.266
Do you know what you did?

821
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.103
Do you have any fucking idea
how many lives you ruined

822
00:57:37.135 --> 00:57:38.771
that night with your
fucking prank call?!

823
00:57:38.804 --> 00:57:40.005
Available units.

824
00:57:40.038 --> 00:57:41.507
we have a domestic
dispute in progress.

825
00:57:41.539 --> 00:57:43.242
Do you know what you did?!

826
00:57:43.275 --> 00:57:44.210
Do you have any fucking idea?!

827
00:57:44.242 --> 00:57:46.211
Suspect
is armed and hostile.

828
00:57:48.179 --> 00:57:51.015
People are dead
because of you!

829
00:57:51.048 --> 00:57:53.184
We were the first
ones on the scene.

830
00:57:53.217 --> 00:57:54.920
Somebody's
gonna get killed!

831
00:57:56.121 --> 00:57:56.889
How were
we supposed to know

832
00:57:56.922 --> 00:57:57.856
the call was fake. huh?

833
00:57:57.889 --> 00:57:59.157
What's your ETA on SWAT?

834
00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:01.493
SWAT is five minutes out.

835
00:58:03.461 --> 00:58:05.230
Say something!

836
00:58:05.264 --> 00:58:08.201
Please. it was an
accident. I didn't mean to.

837
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:10.235
I'm sorry!

838
00:58:22.547 --> 00:58:24.349
No. no. No. no. no.

839
00:58:25.416 --> 00:58:26.818
It was just a...

840
00:58:31.422 --> 00:58:32.858
Listen. Listen!

841
00:58:35.293 --> 00:58:38.029
I didn't know that
was gonna happen.

842
00:58:38.063 --> 00:58:39.432
I didn't mean for
any of it to happen!

843
00:58:41.365 --> 00:58:42.201
I'm sorry.

844
00:58:42.233 --> 00:58:43.402
Shut the fuck up.

845
00:58:51.043 --> 00:58:53.045
His name was Andre Hughes.

846
00:58:55.914 --> 00:58:56.549
Look at him.

847
00:58:58.115 --> 00:58:59.217
Look at him!

848
00:58:59.251 --> 00:59:00.253
He's dead!

849
00:59:03.155 --> 00:59:07.426
He was a husband.
father. teacher. coach.

850
00:59:09.027 --> 00:59:09.862
He's gone.

851
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:14.465
You said it was a
hostage situation.

852
00:59:14.498 --> 00:59:16.101
You said he was armed.

853
00:59:19.905 --> 00:59:22.074
I heard him yelling
from the street.

854
00:59:22.106 --> 00:59:23.474
Let's go! Come on!

855
00:59:23.507 --> 00:59:26.244
I thought he was holding
his family hostage.

856
00:59:26.277 --> 00:59:28.313
That's what you said!

857
00:59:28.347 --> 00:59:31.250
What the fuck was I
supposed to think?

858
00:59:31.282 --> 00:59:33.018
Why would you do this?

859
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:34.052
Tell me why!

860
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.195
Why?!

861
00:59:43.561 --> 00:59:45.463
I'm sorry. it was a...

862
00:59:47.498 --> 00:59:49.300
It was the wrong house.

863
00:59:49.333 --> 00:59:51.903
It was supposed to
be this guy online.

864
00:59:53.304 --> 00:59:54.573
People do it all the time.

865
00:59:56.307 --> 00:59:58.309
We were just playing games.

866
00:59:58.342 --> 01:00:00.378
Do you know what you did?

867
01:00:00.411 --> 01:00:02.347
Do you have any fucking idea?!

868
01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.583
Yeah. keep talking shit.

869
01:00:04.615 --> 01:00:07.619
Kill all of you.
except you. Grinch.

870
01:00:08.686 --> 01:00:10.255
I'll make you my bitch.

871
01:00:11.356 --> 01:00:12.625
You don't know me.

872
01:00:12.657 --> 01:00:14.092
I'll show up with my AR.

873
01:00:14.126 --> 01:00:15.661
Oh. fuck!

874
01:00:15.693 --> 01:00:18.063
That's right.
Suck a dick. motherfucker.

875
01:00:19.398 --> 01:00:20.633
Hey. Justin Bieber.
where you at. man?

876
01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:22.001
Come on. bring it.

877
01:00:22.034 --> 01:00:23.135
This dude thinks he's hard.

878
01:00:23.168 --> 01:00:24.903
Keep talking shit. man.

879
01:00:24.936 --> 01:00:26.471
You guys suck.

880
01:00:26.505 --> 01:00:28.173
If teams were even.
we would fuck you up.

881
01:00:28.206 --> 01:00:29.974
Fuck me up. you
haven't fucked anything.

882
01:00:30.007 --> 01:00:31.175
Beat your ass. bro.

883
01:00:31.208 --> 01:00:32.143
Beat my ass.
only thing you beat

884
01:00:32.177 --> 01:00:33.312
is your own dick. virgin.

885
01:00:34.579 --> 01:00:36.448
You gonna let him talk
to you like that. man?

886
01:00:36.481 --> 01:00:38.017
Tell him what's up.

887
01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:39.285
Where you from?

888
01:00:39.318 --> 01:00:41.487
I'm from L.A.. but
stay at your mom's otherwise.

889
01:00:41.519 --> 01:00:43.456
I'll come fuck you
up with these hands.

890
01:00:44.422 --> 01:00:46.424
Where do you live?

891
01:00:46.458 --> 01:00:48.559
I'll send some of my
squad to come fuck you up.

892
01:00:48.592 --> 01:00:49.961
Wouldn't be the first time.

893
01:00:49.994 --> 01:00:51.195
Squad
with the Mousketeers?

894
01:00:51.228 --> 01:00:52.397
I've killed before
in Afghanistan.

895
01:00:54.099 --> 01:00:55.367
You've killed before?

896
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.434
What. did you go on a
fucking high school trip?

897
01:00:56.467 --> 01:00:57.435
Suck a dick.

898
01:00:58.336 --> 01:00:59.972
Bunch of fags in L.A.

Square. bitch.

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.483
Oh. damn. This guy fucking
challenged you. dude.

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:14.953
You should SWAT him.

904
01:01:14.987 --> 01:01:17.155
Fuck this cock. dude.

905
01:01:17.188 --> 01:01:18.523
He doesn't even
think you'll do it.

906
01:01:30.268 --> 01:01:32.670
Think this muppet gave
me his real address.

907
01:01:34.472 --> 01:01:35.608
What an idiot.

908
01:01:39.443 --> 01:01:41.512
Yo. do you still have
that shitty prepay phone?

909
01:01:41.545 --> 01:01:43.114
- Yeah.
- Oh. perfect. dude.

910
01:01:43.148 --> 01:01:44.383
Use that.

911
01:01:44.416 --> 01:01:45.584
Yeah. just gimme a second.

912
01:01:45.617 --> 01:01:47.419
I gotta find the
police number for L.A.

913
01:01:47.452 --> 01:01:48.254
All right.

914
01:01:50.188 --> 01:01:51.356
What a fucking dumb ass.

915
01:01:51.389 --> 01:01:54.759
You know. dude. we
should record his stream

916
01:01:54.793 --> 01:01:56.260
so we can upload it.

917
01:01:56.293 --> 01:01:57.528
Oh. shit.

918
01:01:57.561 --> 01:01:59.230
Fucking hilarious.

919
01:02:03.568 --> 01:02:05.336
Okay. shut up.
dude. I'm dialing.

920
01:02:05.369 --> 01:02:06.605
Shut the fuck up.

921
01:02:11.108 --> 01:02:12.710
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

922
01:02:12.744 --> 01:02:14.012
Shit. Shit.

923
01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.514
Just try
to remain calm. sir.

924
01:02:16.547 --> 01:02:18.383
What is your emergency?

925
01:02:18.416 --> 01:02:20.249
I...

926
01:02:20.485 --> 01:02:22.621
Start by giving
me your name and your address.

927
01:02:23.521 --> 01:02:25.356
Don't tell me what to do.

928
01:02:25.389 --> 01:02:28.126
Don't you ever tell me
what to do. you understand?

929
01:02:28.159 --> 01:02:30.395
Sir.
yes. I understand.

930
01:02:30.429 --> 01:02:32.231
But how can I help you?

931
01:02:32.264 --> 01:02:33.632
I won't let her take my kids.

932
01:02:35.067 --> 01:02:36.568
She can't take them.

933
01:02:36.601 --> 01:02:37.670
They're mine.

934
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:40.672
Sir. I need
to know where you are

935
01:02:40.704 --> 01:02:43.342
so that I can send help.

936
01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:46.210
14 Independence Square.

937
01:02:46.244 --> 01:02:48.247
I'll shoot her if she leaves.

938
01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.315
You have to stop her.

939
01:02:50.347 --> 01:02:53.786
If she tries to take my
kids. I'll fucking kill her.

940
01:02:53.818 --> 01:02:55.186
Where are you now?

941
01:02:56.655 --> 01:02:58.123
In the kitchen.

942
01:02:58.155 --> 01:03:00.324
Okay.
And where is she?

943
01:03:00.358 --> 01:03:01.293
In the closet.

944
01:03:04.429 --> 01:03:05.463
Are you sending someone?

945
01:03:05.496 --> 01:03:07.132
Yes. officers
have been dispatched.

946
01:03:07.164 --> 01:03:08.467
Now. I'm gonna need
you to stay on the-

947
01:03:09.534 --> 01:03:10.836
Yes.

948
01:03:10.869 --> 01:03:11.771
Oh. shit.

949
01:03:26.117 --> 01:03:28.219
What do you think it's like
to pull a gun on someone?

950
01:03:35.559 --> 01:03:37.695
Is this what it's like
in your fucking game?

951
01:03:40.498 --> 01:03:42.634
It's hard to breathe.
your heart races?

952
01:03:42.666 --> 01:03:45.237
Can you hear it
pounding in your ears?

953
01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:48.306
I heard a glass break. a
girl scream. he was yelling.

954
01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.442
I had to do something!

955
01:03:50.474 --> 01:03:52.443
They say. "Stick to the facts."

956
01:03:52.476 --> 01:03:54.112
He was angry. he had a weapon.

957
01:03:54.146 --> 01:03:55.848
he didn't respond
to instructions.

958
01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.750
The fuck was I supposed to do?!

959
01:03:58.782 --> 01:04:02.387
He took his last breath.
scared and alone.

960
01:04:03.722 --> 01:04:06.625
without anyone who loved him.

961
01:04:06.657 --> 01:04:09.661
- And you stole him from them.
- No justice. no peace!

962
01:04:09.693 --> 01:04:12.730
- They deserve justice.
- No justice. no peace!

963
01:04:12.764 --> 01:04:15.200
- No justice. no peace!
- You did this to him.

964
01:04:15.233 --> 01:04:17.469
- Fucking say it.
- No justice. no peace!

965
01:04:17.501 --> 01:04:19.471
No justice. no peace!

966
01:04:19.503 --> 01:04:21.706
- You killed him.
- No justice. no peace!

967
01:04:21.739 --> 01:04:22.640
- Say it!
- No.

968
01:04:22.673 --> 01:04:23.708
Look at me. Look at me!

969
01:04:23.742 --> 01:04:25.444
You killed him!

970
01:04:25.476 --> 01:04:26.511
I didn't kill anyone!

971
01:04:26.545 --> 01:04:28.547
- No justice. no peace!
- Say it!

972
01:04:28.579 --> 01:04:30.215
- I said say it!
- No justice. no peace!

973
01:04:30.248 --> 01:04:31.383
I'm fine! Call it in!

974
01:04:31.416 --> 01:04:32.317
This is Unit 451.

975
01:04:32.349 --> 01:04:33.485
Shots fired. Suspect down.

976
01:04:33.518 --> 01:04:34.653
We need an ambulance.

977
01:04:34.686 --> 01:04:37.389
Repeat. shots
fired. Suspect down.

978
01:04:37.422 --> 01:04:38.657
Police! Get on
the fucking ground!

979
01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:40.425
What?!

980
01:04:44.461 --> 01:04:46.197
FBI!

981
01:04:47.264 --> 01:04:47.900
Clear?

982
01:04:49.601 --> 01:04:50.635
Hello?

983
01:04:51.637 --> 01:04:53.639
This is Federal Agent
Mayo. Is anyone home?

984
01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:00.811
Kitchen.

985
01:05:00.844 --> 01:05:02.180
Here. All right.

986
01:05:03.648 --> 01:05:04.483
Clear.

987
01:05:06.384 --> 01:05:07.519
Officer Bishop?

988
01:05:09.753 --> 01:05:10.588
Stay close.

989
01:05:15.927 --> 01:05:16.762
FBI.

990
01:05:21.632 --> 01:05:22.734
Stay on it.

991
01:05:28.273 --> 01:05:28.908
Clear.

992
01:05:39.784 --> 01:05:40.818
Ready.

993
01:05:42.753 --> 01:05:44.222
- Cover me.
- Mm-hm.

994
01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:47.792
On three.

995
01:05:47.826 --> 01:05:48.760
One.

996
01:05:48.793 --> 01:05:49.628
Two.

997
01:05:49.661 --> 01:05:50.829
Three.

998
01:05:53.664 --> 01:05:54.800
We got a body!

999
01:06:00.639 --> 01:06:01.840
Where's Officer Bishop?!

1000
01:06:01.873 --> 01:06:02.773
I don't know.

1001
01:06:02.806 --> 01:06:04.742
Where is he. you little shit?!

1002
01:06:04.775 --> 01:06:05.710
I don't know.

1003
01:06:06.644 --> 01:06:07.713
God dammit.

1004
01:07:18.016 --> 01:07:19.652
What
do you want. man?

1005
01:07:23.387 --> 01:07:26.724
Sir. I want you and
your family to know

1006
01:07:26.757 --> 01:07:28.626
exactly what
happened that night.

1007
01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.762
Well. if you're
here for forgiveness.

1008
01:07:30.795 --> 01:07:32.664
I think it's best you leave.

1009
01:07:33.831 --> 01:07:37.802
No. that's not my
intention at all.

1010
01:07:40.472 --> 01:07:42.674
Andre was a better son than
I could've ever asked for.

1011
01:07:42.706 --> 01:07:45.777
and you took him.
you took him from us.

1012
01:07:47.778 --> 01:07:50.114
You know what it's like raising
a son to fear the people

1013
01:07:50.148 --> 01:07:52.851
who are supposed to protect him?

1014
01:07:54.719 --> 01:07:58.824
You know what it's like to
live with that fear? Huh?

1015
01:08:01.925 --> 01:08:03.094
Papa Al?

1016
01:08:04.929 --> 01:08:06.097
Who's at the door?

1017
01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:09.034
Oh. it's the cop.

1018
01:08:10.969 --> 01:08:13.505
He wants to tell
us what happened.

1019
01:08:14.706 --> 01:08:16.942
tell us how he killed my son.

1020
01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.949
Ain't that what you wanna do?

1021
01:08:25.917 --> 01:08:26.952
Papa Al?

1022
01:08:34.826 --> 01:08:35.927
Let him in.

1023
01:08:56.448 --> 01:08:58.884
And when Andre
opened the door that night

1024
01:09:00.717 --> 01:09:02.153
and saw me. I panicked.

1025
01:09:03.755 --> 01:09:06.158
I saw his jersey
and his tattoos.

1026
01:09:07.559 --> 01:09:10.028
and he had a broken
bottle in his hand.

1027
01:09:14.599 --> 01:09:15.667
I was scared.

1028
01:09:23.207 --> 01:09:25.743
I judged what I
saw and I shot him

1029
01:09:25.777 --> 01:09:27.913
- on his way to the trash.
- Oh!

1030
01:09:27.945 --> 01:09:29.948
- Just stop it.
- Come on.

1031
01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:30.948
Let's go. let's go.

1032
01:09:30.981 --> 01:09:32.216
Come on. let's get some air.

1033
01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:33.519
Come on. now.

1034
01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:37.989
I just wanted you
to know the truth.

1035
01:09:54.104 --> 01:09:56.174
Your husband was a good man.

1036
01:09:58.275 --> 01:09:59.811
I took his life.

1037
01:10:01.779 --> 01:10:03.949
And I know there's nothing

1038
01:10:06.251 --> 01:10:08.720
nothing I can do
to bring him back.

1039
01:10:15.092 --> 01:10:17.061
And I'm so sorry for that.

1040
01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:23.935
Mm.

1041
01:10:32.143 --> 01:10:33.244
Andre is gone

1042
01:10:40.018 --> 01:10:41.019
because of you.

1043
01:10:48.158 --> 01:10:49.961
You killed my husband.

1044
01:10:53.698 --> 01:10:57.102
And now. you just walk
in here and apologize.

1045
01:10:58.269 --> 01:11:00.972
and expect for
everything to be over?

1046
01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:15.119
Why is it always us?

1047
01:11:18.088 --> 01:11:21.292
What do you see
when you look at us?

1048
01:11:26.064 --> 01:11:29.067
I mean. it's not anything new.

1049
01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.802
But everyone always wants us

1050
01:11:30.835 --> 01:11:33.939
to accept your
apologies and move on.

1051
01:11:43.948 --> 01:11:45.117
I won't do it.

1052
01:12:28.426 --> 01:12:30.195
I'm sorry. Sergeant.

1053
01:12:30.228 --> 01:12:31.229
I fucked up.

1054
01:12:34.431 --> 01:12:35.934
Glad you called.

1055
01:12:58.922 --> 01:13:02.893
People of the State of
California versus William Bishop.

1056
01:13:02.926 --> 01:13:05.363
Case number BA19107.

1057
01:13:07.765 --> 01:13:10.168
The matter is here
for arraignment.

1058
01:13:10.201 --> 01:13:12.037
All parties are present.

1059
01:13:13.104 --> 01:13:14.806
I've reviewed the
evidence in this case

1060
01:13:14.838 --> 01:13:16.740
as well as the obstruction
of justice charge

1061
01:13:16.774 --> 01:13:18.176
against Chase Miller.

1062
01:13:19.277 --> 01:13:21.012
Absolutely senseless.

1063
01:13:22.145 --> 01:13:22.980
Tragic.

1064
01:13:25.216 --> 01:13:26.417
These are the words
that come to mind

1065
01:13:26.451 --> 01:13:30.389
on a case the details of which
I've never seen this before.

1066
01:13:34.024 --> 01:13:36.027
Will the defendant please rise?

1067
01:13:42.432 --> 01:13:45.804
Mr. Bishop. your attorney has
indicated it is your intention

1068
01:13:45.837 --> 01:13:48.139
to enter into a not guilty plea

1069
01:13:48.171 --> 01:13:52.276
to count one of this complaint.
voluntary manslaughter.

1070
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:56.847
a violation of Penal Code
section 192. subsection A.

1071
01:13:56.881 --> 01:13:57.716
Correct?

1072
01:13:59.216 --> 01:14:00.184
Yes.

1073
01:14:02.453 --> 01:14:04.322
Is that
correct. Mr. Bishop?

1074
01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:11.063
No. No. Your Honor.

1075
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:13.965
Counsel. what's going on here

1076
01:14:13.997 --> 01:14:17.034
Your honor. may I have a
moment to speak with my client?

1077
01:14:17.068 --> 01:14:18.869
Yes.

1078
01:14:18.903 --> 01:14:20.137
You can't do this.

1079
01:14:20.171 --> 01:14:22.273
You need to plead not guilty.

1080
01:14:22.305 --> 01:14:24.475
Do you understand the risk
you're putting on the department?

1081
01:14:25.408 --> 01:14:27.177
This is a complicated case.

1082
01:14:27.211 --> 01:14:28.780
No jury will find you guilty.

1083
01:14:28.813 --> 01:14:30.148
- I made up my mind.
- Your honor.

1084
01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.381
if we could have a short recess?

1085
01:14:31.414 --> 01:14:33.083
I would like to
speak with my client.

1086
01:14:33.117 --> 01:14:36.454
Your honor. I'm guilty
of the charges against me.

1087
01:14:38.389 --> 01:14:41.226
Mr. Bishop. sir. this
is your arraignment.

1088
01:14:41.259 --> 01:14:43.895
It's unheard of to enter into
a guilty plea at this time.

1089
01:14:43.927 --> 01:14:46.765
Are you sure that's what
you want to do. sir?

1090
01:14:46.797 --> 01:14:47.998
Yes. Your Honor.

1091
01:14:52.336 --> 01:14:53.805
Mr. Bishop. do you
waive and give up

1092
01:14:53.837 --> 01:14:56.240
your right to a jury trial.

1093
01:14:56.274 --> 01:14:59.043
the right to confront and
cross-examine witnesses.

1094
01:14:59.076 --> 01:15:02.346
and to present evidence and
testimony on your own behalf?

1095
01:15:05.082 --> 01:15:07.152
Yes. I give up my
right. Your Honor.

1096
01:15:08.319 --> 01:15:10.388
Let the record reflect
that the defendant willingly.

1097
01:15:10.421 --> 01:15:12.289
knowingly. and
understandably has entered

1098
01:15:12.323 --> 01:15:16.394
into a plea of guilty to
the charge of manslaughter.

1099
01:15:18.296 --> 01:15:21.298
The clerk will have
him initial and sign

1100
01:15:21.332 --> 01:15:23.201
a formal plea agreement.

1101
01:15:24.368 --> 01:15:26.137
Counsel. do you waive
time for sentencing?

1102
01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:27.439
Yes. Your Honor.

1103
01:15:29.073 --> 01:15:32.077
Formal sentencing will be
held one week from today.

1104
01:15:34.212 --> 01:15:37.515
Mr. Bishop. your OR
status is hereby revoked.

1105
01:15:37.547 --> 01:15:40.918
Bailiff. he is to be remanded
into custody forthwith.

1106
01:15:43.154 --> 01:15:44.322
We're done here.

1107
01:15:45.256 --> 01:15:47.258
Court's adjourned.

1108
01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:50.162
You just hung yourself
and the department. Nice.

1109
01:16:18.221 --> 01:16:19.157
Bishop.

1110
01:16:20.891 --> 01:16:21.960
I'm floored. I'm floored.

1111
01:16:21.993 --> 01:16:23.862
Listen. just talk to Jan.

1112
01:16:23.895 --> 01:16:26.498
You can't just
leave her like this.

1113
01:16:28.099 --> 01:16:30.368
I don't know
what to say to her.

1114
01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.836
She still loves you.

1115
01:16:35.372 --> 01:16:36.273
Thank you.

1116
01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.235
I'm sorry.

1117
01:17:15.279 --> 01:17:16.915
This is the right thing.

1118
01:17:25.355 --> 01:17:26.423
I love you.

1119
01:17:28.125 --> 01:17:29.194
I love you.

1120
01:17:31.494 --> 01:17:33.030
Oh. god.
