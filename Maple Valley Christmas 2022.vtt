3
00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:12.429
This is my favorite story.

4
00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:15.473
It's the story about two people

5
00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:18.768
so in love that anything
seemed possible.

6
00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.523
{\an8}Those people were my great
grandparents. who in 1931.

7
00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:26.026
with nothing more than the
clothes on their backs.

8
00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.611
{\an8}crossed this country in
search of a new life.

9
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:32.323
{\an8}And when they got here. it
looked nothing like it does now.

10
00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:36.036
There was no trees.
no barn. no house.

11
00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:39.539
{\an8}And with just a dream. they
started planting maple.

12
00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.416
{\an8}And eventually my
grandparents took over.

13
00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.335
{\an8}planted more. and
same with my mother.

14
00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:46.046
{\an8}And now. four generations
later. Maple Valley Farm

15
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:50.175
{\an8}is the largest maple
syrup farm in Montana.

16
00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:52.344
{\an8}And terrible joke alert.

17
00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.679
{\an8}but when I am feeling sappy.

18
00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.181
I like to remind myself

19
00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:58.224
that patience and hard
work begets sweetness.

20
00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.893
And speaking of sweetness.

21
00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.895
{\an8}maybe you wanna gift
some for Christmas.

22
00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.647
{\an8}So awkward segue
and shameless plug

23
00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.566
for our popular barrel
aged maple syrup

24
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.611
{\an8}and other delicious
maple sourced products.

25
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.071
{\an8}Now. if you'll follow me.

26
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.572
we will make our way
to the gift shop.

27
00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:20.330
{\an8}Our wonderful ranch hands.

28
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.332
Margot and Ollie.
are here to help you.

29
00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:24.209
{\an8}And if you need
a Christmas tree.

30
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.127
{\an8}be sure to visit our neighbors
at the Fernandez Tree Lot.

31
00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:27.253
Just make a left
out of the driveway.

32
00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.922
You can't miss it.

33
00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.590
{\an8}And don't forget.
Maple Valley Farm

34
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.926
{\an8}hosts an unforgettable week
of Christmas activities.

35
00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.594
{\an8}We have a giant tree lighting.

36
00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.638
{\an8}We've got photos with Santa.
a Maple Christmas Fair.

37
00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:39.432
and the not to miss prime
rib sleigh ride dinner.

38
00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.310
{\an8}So check out our website.
or just pester Margo.

39
00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:51.236
How's it going?

40
00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.362
Pretty good.

41
00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.280
{\an8}I'm just about finish the books.

42
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.116
{\an8}I just need the sales from the
last few days of the quarter.

43
00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:58.368
{\an8}and then we can go
over into the numbers.

44
00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.662
{\an8}- Ooh.
- What you got there?

45
00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:01.955
{\an8}Oh. we're packaging
and gift wrapping

46
00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.123
for The Maple Shoppe.

47
00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.124
Wait. we already need more?

48
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.125
Business is good.

49
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.793
So is your husband.

50
00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:10.046
because I brought you
guys some peppermint bark.

51
00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:11.715
My hero.

52
00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.133
Mwah.
- I know.

53
00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:22.183
How long will you be staying?

54
00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.161
Mom. what are you saying?

55
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.872
Something about
a family meeting.

56
00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:46.332
When did you learn Italian?

57
00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.293
Oh. I spent a lot of
time with your mother.

58
00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:50.920
- Uh-huh.
- Trevor's right.

59
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.090
And I do wanna have
a family meeting.

60
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.050
Don't worry.

61
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.301
No. everything's okay.

62
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.011
I just have some news to share.

63
00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.262
Well. it's not
gonna be shocking.

64
00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:00.680
because as you know.

65
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.931
I've been pulling back
a little from the farm.

66
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:03.266
you know. working less.

67
00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.225
Oh. we've noticed.

68
00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:08.188
And you also know that I've
been thinking about retiring

69
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:12.525
and I've decided
it's finally time.

70
00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:16.071
I have loved every
minute of my life here

71
00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:20.075
of raising you two here.
working alongside you.

72
00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.619
I mean. it's. it's
been a dream come true.

73
00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:26.956
And. uh. now I'm. I'm. I'm
ready for a new chapter.

74
00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:28.708
And you're ready
to take the reins.

75
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.710
You know. my mother
passed this land onto me

76
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.923
and now I get to pass it on
to you two. to run together.

77
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.219
This place doesn't
run without you.

78
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.720
Of course it does.

79
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.930
But you're our glue.

80
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:42.889
Oh.

81
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:48.603
I know that this is
gonna be a big change.

82
00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:53.066
but I also know that
you two. you got this.

83
00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.526
We're gonna be partners.

84
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.486
Partners.

85
00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.615
Aw. we're gonna
miss you. boss.

86
00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:04.953
Okay.

87
00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:13.753
Hey. buddy.

88
00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.171
Phoenix file?

89
00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.631
- You bet.
- How's the old man's mood?

90
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.300
Oh. you know how he
gets over the holidays.

91
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.969
I do. and every Christmas

92
00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.097
I'm hoping that this is
the year he's gonna change.

93
00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.932
That would be a
Christmas miracle.

94
00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:26.975
Oh. yeah.

95
00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.103
Dad. looking good.

96
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.771
New tie?

97
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.815
All right. let's talk
about the Phoenix property.

98
00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.320
So after reviewing the file.

99
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.781
it looks like. well. there's
a lot of good options

100
00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.742
for the land next
to the retail space.

101
00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:46.911
Affordable housing.
community garden. a park.

102
00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:48.413
Show me the numbers.

103
00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:52.292
We're still. we're still
working on the numbers.

104
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.420
So we're basically not
meeting our timeline.

105
00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:57.964
Aaron.

106
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.383
lean on them.

107
00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:03.970
Dad. it's 10 days
till Christmas.

108
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.472
Everyone's in holiday mode.

109
00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:12.395
Okay. I'll check in on Monday.

110
00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:13.521
Can you set up a call?

111
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.315
Yes. but just to remind you.

112
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.485
I'm out of the office
starting tonight.

113
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.487
Heading home for the holidays.

114
00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.822
What do you do for
Christmas. Connor?

115
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.242
Oh. my whole extended
family comes to town.

116
00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:29.329
There's lots of
cooking. lots of eating.

117
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.122
Someone brings up old drama.

118
00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.499
Multiple people cry.

119
00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.751
Beautiful family traditions.

120
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:35.919
What about you two?

121
00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.088
What do they Davenport's
do for Christmas?

122
00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.130
- I golf.
- I ski.

123
00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:47.639
Steve. it's the real estate
agent who called earlier.

124
00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:49.891
Are you buying
another property?

125
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:50.767
Hopefully.

126
00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:53.144
I'm glad I'm kept in the loop.

127
00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:59.442
By the way. Dad. I'm out of
the office at noon tomorrow.

128
00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.111
I'm going to Aspen.

129
00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:01.986
So you're leaving
the office early.

130
00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:02.862
Long vacation.

131
00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.030
Must be nice.

132
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.198
I'll be working remotely.

133
00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.157
It's fine.

134
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.413
I work hard. so you. my son.

135
00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:13.164

I mean. we knew it was coming.
but still it's a big change.

149
00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:48.950
Yeah. I know.

150
00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:53.913
But sometimes change is good.

151
00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:56.708
even taking some risks.

152
00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:58.960
Are you saying I
don't take risks?

153
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.462
I'm not not saying it.

154
00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:06.926
Are you sure you're okay
with us being partners?

155
00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.219
Of course.

156
00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.512
Why?

157
00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.056
'Cause we're sisters.

158
00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:13.892
Yeah. but we'll be
good business partners.

159
00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:18.480
I mean. you have the MBA. I
have the technical knowhow.

160
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.273
We have complimentary skills.

161
00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:23.109
Yeah. plus the farm
runs like clockwork.

162
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.862
so everything will be fine.

163
00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.280
Exactly.

164
00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:36.164
Oh. girls. look
what Andres gave us.

165
00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:37.582
Just a way of saying thank you

166
00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.334
for sending so much
business my way.

167
00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:40.794
Oh. nice try. honey.

168
00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.754
but you gift us a tree
every year.

169
00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.964
Well. it's always my pleasure.

170
00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:47.634
And this will be the
last year as. uh...

171
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.595
Well. the day you've all
been waiting for has arrived.

172
00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.806
I spoke with my
sister this morning.

173
00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.599
Everybody's finally on board.

174
00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:56.726
Wait. you're
selling your property?

175
00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.353
Well. you're just so happy

176
00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.813
to not have me as your
neighbor any longer.

177
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:00.647
No. no.

178
00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.607
We. we will miss you.

179
00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:04.025
And we will come
visit you in Florida.

180
00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.735
especially in the winter.

181
00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.362
You know how much your
land means to our family.

182
00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:09.114
And I know how long
you've wanted it back.

183
00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:11.908
We will have to discuss
it first. so of course.

184
00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:14.327
So I just wanna give you a
heads up about a little issue.

185
00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.912
If it were up to me.

186
00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.164
I would sell the
property directly to you.

187
00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:20.750
But it's my sister's land too.

188
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.252
And they want a public sale.

189
00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:23.712
So you're listing it.

190
00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.255
Yes. but it's
just a formality.

191
00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.799
Of course. no. we understand.

192
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.509
Alright. good.

193
00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.052
Well. I gotta get going.

194
00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.220
Okay.

195
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.138
Thanks.

196
00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:37.517
Don't worry. the
lands as good as ours.

197
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.685
Who's gonna want a property

198
00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.061
in the middle of
nowhere Montana?

199
00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:44.899
Okay. thanks so much.

200
00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.068
Yeah. you have a great
holiday season as well.

201
00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:48.069
Okay. bye-bye.

202
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:53.491
Aaron.

203
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:55.201
Hey. pal.

204
00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.703
No. no. no. no.

205
00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.580
Whatever my dad has sent
you here to tell me. no.

206
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.457
My flight to Aspen
is in an hour.

207
00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:02.709
Yeah. about that.

208
00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.753
Teeny weeny change of plans.

209
00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.421
Your dad needs you
to look at a property

210
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:09.090
in Maple Valley.
Montana tomorrow.

211
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.966
What?

212
00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.053
Maple Valley. why
does that ring a bell?

213
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.055
And why does this have
to happen on my vacation?

214
00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:17.432
Because the property
just got listed.

215
00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.100
And supposedly.

216
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.896
your dad has had his eye
on this location for years.

217
00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.732
And you know how he gets
when he wants something.

218
00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.442
Oh yeah. yeah. I do.

219
00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:30.653
And right now what he wants is
for me to not go on vacation.

220
00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:33.239
But he always gets
what he wants. right?

221
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:40.580
How's it looking?

222
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.581
Good.

223
00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.838
I think this one
can use a new tap.

224
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:55.136
We've got two
old tap holes here.

225
00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:56.971
Maybe let her heal.

226
00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:32.507
Oh. no. Archie got out again.

227
00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:34.175
Better go check
the trail for him.

228
00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.260
Do you want me to go?

229
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.261
No. I got it.

230
00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:37.178
You two get outta here?

231
00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:46.479
Hey. there. boy.

232
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.355
Hi.

233
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.774
You lost?

234
00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:53.695
Where'd you come from?

235
00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:00.326
I'm gonna get on
your back. alright?

236
00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.202
We're gonna get you home.

237
00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:15.925
Come on. Archie.
where are you?

238
00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.107
There you are.

239
00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:32.692
Archie.

240
00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:33.943
So that's your name.

241
00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.862
Gotta stop running off. buddy.

242
00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:38.698
Thanks for finding him.

243
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:39.824
Pleasure.

244
00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.540
Surprised you're having
such an easy time with him.

245
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.710
I grew up around horses.

246
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.837
Anyway. thanks
for saving the day.

247
00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:57.425
What are you doing out
in these woods anyway?

248
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.387
I was. I was just driving by

249
00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:02.305
and I saw Archie here
looking like a lost puppy.

250
00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.516
I figured somebody must
be looking for him.

251
00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:09.020
I need to find my car.

252
00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.565
Do you know where a
Til-Tilden Lane is?

253
00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.150
Yeah. uh...

254
00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:18.029
You know. why don't I get
Archie back and I'll walk you.

255
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.073
It's the least I can do.

256
00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:20.907
Sure.

257
00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.617
I'm Erica. by the way.

258
00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:23.785
Aaron.

259
00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:27.622
Where am I?

260
00:12:27.622 --> 00:12:29.416
You're on my family's
maple syrup farm.

261
00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.462
Weird.

262
00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:35.463
What is it?

263
00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:37.257
It's just familiar.

264
00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.258
Well.

265
00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:46.474
So this is a maple farm.

266
00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:52.313
Where's all the syrup
and the lumberjacks

267
00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.941
with the flannels
carrying the big buckets?

268
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.735
Oh. well. the maple
syrup doesn't exist yet.

269
00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:58.820
'cause the sap is
still in the trees.

270
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.906
It doesn't flow until
late winter. early spring.

271
00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.908
Then we'll harvest
the sap. boil it down.

272
00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.660
grade it. bottle it.

273
00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.287
As for the lumberjacks.

274
00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.414
they're probably with
the other outdated ideas

275
00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:10.582
about farming.

276
00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:11.958
This farm's run by my mom.

277
00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:16.546
Actually. now it's run
by my sister and me.

278
00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.631
So you're female lumberjacks?

279
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.008
Lumberjackies?

280
00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.193
What. what is this?

281
00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:41.696
Oh. it's part of our
Christmas themed horseback ride.

282
00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:43.740
We take groups to the
candy cane forest.

283
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.494
past the twirly swirling
gumdrop plains to here.

284
00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:48.828
the mistletoe meadow.

285
00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.372
It's a social media favorite.

286
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.627
I know why this
is familiar to me.

287
00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.380
I've been here before.

288
00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:01.883
It was a family vacation.

289
00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:04.469
I was probably seven
or eight years old.

290
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.722
Is that possible?

291
00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:09.307
Yeah.

292
00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:11.810
My mom or grandma
would've been your guide.

293
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.812
Wow.

294
00:14:13.812 --> 00:14:16.398
What a small world.

295
00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:17.399
Come one.

296
00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:20.151
So this is your job.

297
00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.903
You take people out
on horseback ride

298
00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:23.405
to bring 'em to the
mistletoe so they can kiss.

299
00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:26.366
Yeah. it's. it's what
it says on my LinkedIn.

300
00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.952
So. I obviously do other
things than that. but yes.

301
00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:31.037
part of my job does entail

302
00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:33.289
trying not to watch
happy couples kiss

303
00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:36.042
while fielding
questions from strangers

304
00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.128
about my dating status.

305
00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:39.587
Oh. I'm sure that
never gets old.

306
00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.047
No. never.

307
00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.924
I love twice a day.
five days a week.

308
00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:45.051
people asking me
why am I single?

309
00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:49.055
Sure it's tough
though. to date here.

310
00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:52.851
You know. it's a small
town. small pool.

311
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:55.061
But you can date tourists.

312
00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.147
Yes. but I don't
date the tourists.

313
00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:01.234
We're almost back.

314
00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:15.540
So you're from out of town?

315
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.083
Yeah. San Diego.

316
00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:20.962
Not too far.

317
00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.173
Why you out here?

318
00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:25.633
Just. uh. just
here for business.

319
00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.345
Just passing through.

320
00:15:33.683 --> 00:15:34.559
It's a nice hat.

321
00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:37.854
Where can I get
something like this?

322
00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.106
You don't get a cowboy hat.

323
00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:42.317
You earn it.

324
00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:45.487
Said your car's on Tilden Lane?

325
00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:48.323
Yeah. yeah. it's. uh. it's
right past the turn off.

326
00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:50.950
It's not too far.

327
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.077
I'll walk you.

328
00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.663
Oh. there you are. hun.

329
00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:57.499
Eggnog's ready?

330
00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:58.625
Mom?

331
00:15:58.625 --> 00:15:59.793
Ah. who do we have here?

332
00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.252
Hi. I'm Aaron.

333
00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:03.963
Archie got out.
Aaron found him.

334
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:07.258
Oh. well. let us thank
you with some eggnog.

335
00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:09.469
Okay.

336
00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:12.514
Come on in. Aaron.

337
00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:16.267
This is my younger daughter.

338
00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:18.645
Heidi and her husband. Trevor.

339
00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:20.313
This here is Aaron.

340
00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:23.525
He's our honorary
ranchhand for the day.

341
00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:26.486
Archie got out and he found him.

342
00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:27.821
Oh. hi.

343
00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:29.239
Nice to meet you.
- Howdy.

344
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.825
Would you like
that eggnog now?

345
00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:34.244
I am definitely
ready for that eggnog.

346
00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:36.579
So were you guys
doing something?

347
00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:37.997
No. we're just hanging out.

348
00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.624
- Mm-hmm.
- Just voluntarily hanging out

349
00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:41.793
with relatives for fun?

350
00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:44.504
That's what we do.

351
00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:46.172
I've heard of this. but
I've. I've actually never.

352
00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.133
I never witnessed it.
- Pretty shocking to me

353
00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:49.676
the first time I did it too.

354
00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:53.346
You know. this is
incredible eggnog.

355
00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.514
Oh. thank you.

356
00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.182
Old family recipe.

357
00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:58.018
A very old one.

358
00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:59.352
My great-grandma perfected it.

359
00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:01.646
We've toned down the bourbon.

360
00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:03.106
Winter's used to be colder.

361
00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:07.235
So. Aaron. where
are you coming from?

362
00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.737
Born and raised in San Diego.

363
00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:11.114
Just visiting Maple Valley?

364
00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:15.201
Yeah. I'm just. um. passing
through on my way to Aspen.

365
00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:17.537
If you're still
around tomorrow.

366
00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:19.622
why don't you come
to the tree lighting?

367
00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:20.915
Starts at dusk.

368
00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:22.834
Yeah.

369
00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:26.671
If I'm still here tomorrow.
I will definitely be there.

370
00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:34.971
Wow.

371
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:36.473
It's so beautiful.

372
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.726
And freezing.

373
00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:42.729
Hey. you don't have to walk me.

374
00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:46.608
Oh. uh. if you're sure.

375
00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:52.822
You just had some
snow in your hair.

376
00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:07.295
Wow. okay.

377
00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:10.298
I'm so sorry.

378
00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:14.636
I have no idea what
just came over me.

379
00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:15.637
Don't apologize.

380
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.649
Uh. Tilden Lane?

381
00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.528
Oh yeah. it's. it's just
behind the. the parking lot.

382
00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:36.658
One more thing.

383
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.870
Andres Fernandez property?

384
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.040
Okay. it starts just at the
end of the tree line there.

385
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.166
Why?

386
00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:49.421
It's the reason I'm here.

387
00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:51.881
I'm a real estate developer

388
00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.925
and we're looking
to buy his land.

389
00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:55.552
Excuse me?

390
00:18:55.552 --> 00:18:56.845
I work for a real estate
development company.

391
00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.263
No. I know. I. I heard you.

392
00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:01.683
Wanna know why I'm single?

393
00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:05.687
I always pick the wrong men.

394
00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:24.831
So what happened with Mr.
Real Estate development guy?

395
00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:26.166
What?

396
00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:27.876
Nothing. what. what do you mean?

397
00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:31.588
She means. you walked him
to his car and then returned

398
00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:34.382
looking like you just stuck
your finger in a socket.

399
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.177
I told you. that was
because I just found out

400
00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:38.595
he might bid against
us for the property.

401
00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:41.056
- Mm-hmm.
- Why is that such a shock?

402
00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:42.891
We knew there'd
be other bidders.

403
00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:45.310
I mean. not like him.

404
00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.742
Something definitely
happened between you two.

405
00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:03.787
Fine.

406
00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.246
It stays between us.

407
00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:09.918
I sort of kissed him.

408
00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.211
Seriously?

409
00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:13.004
That is so unlike you.

410
00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:13.880
I know.

411
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.048
Believe me.

412
00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:16.508
Well. how was it?

413
00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:19.636
It was amazing.

414
00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:25.308
It was like we had to kiss.
like it couldn't not happen.

415
00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:27.227
Well. that's exciting.

416
00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:29.396
No. it's not exciting.

417
00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:30.522
It's not anything.

418
00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:33.858
Why not?

419
00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:37.278
Because. if we get
the property. I'll
never see him again.

420
00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:39.531
And if he gets the property.

421
00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:41.408
I'll never want
to see him again.

422
00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:48.957
Listen. we should talk
about the Fernandez land.

423
00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:50.959
What about it?

424
00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:54.004
I'm not sure if
we should bid on it.

425
00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:57.090
I think that the money could
be better used somewhere else.

426
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.134
But that was always the plan.

427
00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:00.802
Buy the land. plant more maple.

428
00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:02.929
Yeah. but plans change.

429
00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:04.681
Especially business plans.

430
00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.809
Let's discuss it with Mom.

431
00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:14.524
So instead of using the money
to buy more land and maple.

432
00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:17.360
which takes 30 to
40 years to tap.

433
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.904
we could use the money to
build the business now.

434
00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:22.949
Buy our own sugaring house.
vertically integrate.

435
00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:24.576
We could even go retail.

436
00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:26.411
I mean. people love our syrup.

437
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:28.455
Why be limited to a gift store?

438
00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:30.373
We could sell in grocery stores.

439
00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.000
Except we can't
sell more syrup.

440
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.668
if we don't have more trees.

441
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.296
Okay. well. if
we need more trees.

442
00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:38.131
then we buy more land later.

443
00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.424
Except the land's
available now.

444
00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:41.134
We can buy other land later.

445
00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:42.552
But this is the land we want.

446
00:21:42.552 --> 00:21:44.804
But that is an
emotional decision.

447
00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:47.974
Girls. there's no
right choice here.

448
00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:49.434
I can't get involved.

449
00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:51.519
You're partners now.
you gotta figure it out.

450
00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:53.813
There's gonna be
lots of big choices

451
00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:57.067
and you're gonna have to find
a way to make them together.

452
00:21:57.067 --> 00:21:58.234
You're gonna have to be patient.

453
00:21:58.234 --> 00:21:59.986
Communicate with each other.

454
00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:00.862
You'll be fine.

455
00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:03.823
Trevor. can you
please explain it?

456
00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:05.325
No. no.

457
00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:07.327
Not happening. mm-mm.

458
00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:09.746
Okay. let's just
table this for now.

459
00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:12.290
Focus on the Christmas
tree lighting.

460
00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:15.377
Hey.

461
00:22:20.715 --> 00:22:23.134
Don't worry.
she'll come around.

462
00:22:23.134 --> 00:22:25.887
Oh. honey. I am.
I am not worried.

463
00:22:27.514 --> 00:22:30.975
But if I was worried.
wouldn't be about the land.

464
00:22:45.907 --> 00:22:47.784
Hey.

465
00:22:48.993 --> 00:22:51.287
I. uh. didn't know
if I was still invited

466
00:22:51.287 --> 00:22:53.707
after you kissed me

467
00:22:53.707 --> 00:22:56.543
and then in a totally
bewildering twist

468
00:22:56.543 --> 00:22:58.670
got upset and stormed off.

469
00:23:00.588 --> 00:23:01.631
Hm.

470
00:23:03.258 --> 00:23:04.175
Sorry.

471
00:23:06.219 --> 00:23:07.429
Apology accepted.

472
00:23:08.847 --> 00:23:10.849
You wanna. you wanna tell
me what's. what's up?

473
00:23:10.849 --> 00:23:13.935
My family has been on this
land for nearly a century.

474
00:23:15.353 --> 00:23:17.856
Both this property and
the Fernandez land.

475
00:23:17.856 --> 00:23:19.315
which we used to own.

476
00:23:19.315 --> 00:23:21.276
When we came here.
there was nothing.

477
00:23:21.276 --> 00:23:22.819
And we planted and we built

478
00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:25.071
and we turned it
into what it is now.

479
00:23:26.698 --> 00:23:30.118
But there were hard times
and it was bad weather.

480
00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:34.581
Sap didn't flow. machinery
broke. and we needed money.

481
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:38.960
So we sold what became
the Fernandez land.

482
00:23:41.629 --> 00:23:43.840
We've been waiting 30
years to buy it back.

483
00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:46.968
Wow.

484
00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:57.103
I wish you would've
told me that earlier.

485
00:23:58.688 --> 00:24:02.484
Look. I mean. there's facets
of the land that weren't ideal.

486
00:24:04.819 --> 00:24:09.532
I had my doubts. and
maybe that's a sign.

487
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.827
I'll just. I'll tell
my dad it's a no go.

488
00:24:13.828 --> 00:24:14.621
Really?

489
00:24:14.621 --> 00:24:15.997
Yeah. no problem.

490
00:24:17.165 --> 00:24:19.459
Okay. I. I'm very grateful

491
00:24:19.459 --> 00:24:21.461
and definitely not trying
to change your mind.

492
00:24:21.461 --> 00:24:23.880
but you're sure?

493
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.425
Yes. yeah. no. the land.
it wasn't right for us.

494
00:24:27.425 --> 00:24:30.095
And obviously it
means a lot to you.

495
00:24:33.139 --> 00:24:38.520
Now. if you excuse me. I.
uh. I'll go call my dad.

496
00:24:49.906 --> 00:24:50.532
Yep.

497
00:24:50.532 --> 00:24:51.700
Hey. Dad.

498
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.326
Did you put our offer in yet?

499
00:24:53.326 --> 00:24:55.161
No. I didn't. didn't
put the offer in.

500
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:57.997
I've actually changed my
mind. we're not gonna bid.

501
00:24:57.997 --> 00:24:59.416
Why not?

502
00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:02.836
Well. there's a lot
of. lot of reasons.

503
00:25:02.836 --> 00:25:04.587
Lots of reasons.

504
00:25:04.587 --> 00:25:07.632
Um. you know. the. the. the
land isn't really build ready

505
00:25:07.632 --> 00:25:10.510
and. uh. we'd have to dig
more wells. run more power.

506
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.845
We'd have to also
change the zoning

507
00:25:11.845 --> 00:25:13.346
to get out of its current use.

508
00:25:13.346 --> 00:25:15.056
Oh. I see what's going on.

509
00:25:15.056 --> 00:25:16.891
You don't want to bid because
you don't wanna stay out there

510
00:25:16.891 --> 00:25:18.768
while I close the deal
and send the surveyors.

511
00:25:18.768 --> 00:25:20.228
You want to go to Aspen?

512
00:25:20.228 --> 00:25:21.896
No. that is not the reason.

513
00:25:26.776 --> 00:25:28.278
The reason I don't wanna bid

514
00:25:28.278 --> 00:25:30.989
is because the
neighbors want the land.

515
00:25:30.989 --> 00:25:32.449
And?

516
00:25:32.449 --> 00:25:33.867
And it's not worth
our time or energy.

517
00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:35.702
Working isn't
worth your energy?

518
00:25:36.494 --> 00:25:37.620
Then what is Aaron?

519
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.372
Because this is your job.

520
00:25:39.372 --> 00:25:40.999
This is our company.

521
00:25:40.999 --> 00:25:42.709
Your company.

522
00:25:42.709 --> 00:25:44.377
Okay. well. it. it will
be yours one day. right?

523
00:25:44.377 --> 00:25:46.046
Well. if it's
gonna be my company.

524
00:25:46.046 --> 00:25:47.714
then I don't want this
property in my portfolio.

525
00:25:47.714 --> 00:25:50.008
Why. because the
neighbors want it?

526
00:25:50.008 --> 00:25:51.009
You know what?

527
00:25:51.009 --> 00:25:51.760
You give up too easy.

528
00:25:52.969 --> 00:25:56.014
Look. Dad. this land
is not right for us.

529
00:25:56.014 --> 00:25:57.891
There are a lot of other
options in Montana.

530
00:25:57.891 --> 00:25:59.392
I'll find you something else.

531
00:25:59.392 --> 00:26:00.393
I gotta go.

532
00:26:00.393 --> 00:26:02.103
No. no. no. wait. ah.

533
00:26:09.486 --> 00:26:10.362
It's done.

534
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.740
Thank you.

535
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.367
You're welcome.

536
00:26:15.367 --> 00:26:16.701
I'm. I'm a little sad though

537
00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:18.870
that we're not
gonna be neighbors.

538
00:26:20.288 --> 00:26:21.790
Well. you wouldn't have lived

539
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:22.999
on the property anyway. right?

540
00:26:22.999 --> 00:26:24.709
Yeah. I probably

541
00:26:24.709 --> 00:26:26.044
would've turned it into a
vacation community or...

542
00:26:26.044 --> 00:26:27.128
That would ruin it.

543
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.007
It's quiet here. it's pristine.

544
00:26:32.092 --> 00:26:34.010
We've avoided
development for so long.

545
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.096
Hopefully you've
avoided it again.

546
00:26:37.764 --> 00:26:41.393
So tell me about this. what.
Montana. big sky. big tree?

547
00:26:41.393 --> 00:26:45.814
Oh. I will have you know
this is not just any big tree.

548
00:26:45.814 --> 00:26:48.817
This was my grandparents' first
Christmas tree in Montana.

549
00:26:48.817 --> 00:26:51.069
My grandma got a live
tree and planted it here

550
00:26:51.069 --> 00:26:52.696
and then every year
they would decorate it

551
00:26:52.696 --> 00:26:54.406
and have a little tree lighting.

552
00:26:55.782 --> 00:26:57.659
It's now a very
big tree lighting.

553
00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:03.998
You're lucky. my family
never did any of this stuff.

554
00:27:03.998 --> 00:27:05.792
Why. what did your
family usually do?

555
00:27:05.792 --> 00:27:11.006
Oh. expensive gifts.
emotional stonewalling.

556
00:27:11.756 --> 00:27:12.424
Bailey's on cornflakes.

557
00:27:13.717 --> 00:27:15.719
It's a heartwarming
time of year.

558
00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:16.594
Well. I think it's special.

559
00:27:16.594 --> 00:27:17.721
You can join us.

560
00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:20.306
Okay. everyone.

561
00:27:20.306 --> 00:27:21.516
It's time.

562
00:27:27.689 --> 00:27:29.441
- Right. hey guys. hi.
- Hi.

563
00:27:29.441 --> 00:27:30.650
Oh. we're hugging.

564
00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.193
- Yeah.
- Yeah. we're huggers.

565
00:27:32.193 --> 00:27:33.486
but we don't have to.

566
00:27:33.486 --> 00:27:35.280
No. I. I like a. I like a hug.

567
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.322
Okay.

568
00:27:36.322 --> 00:27:37.741
And you know what?

569
00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:39.159
You have to come
by the gift shop.

570
00:27:39.159 --> 00:27:40.493
I'm gonna give you a
bottle of that eggnog

571
00:27:40.493 --> 00:27:41.953
that you like so much.

572
00:27:41.953 --> 00:27:44.205
Oh. thank you. that's.
that's very thoughtful.

573
00:27:45.498 --> 00:27:46.916
Alrighty.
do the honors.

574
00:27:46.916 --> 00:27:49.002
No. I'm not doing
the honors anymore.

575
00:27:49.002 --> 00:27:51.504
It's Erica and Heidi's turn now.

576
00:27:51.504 --> 00:27:54.382
Or maybe Erica and
Aaron could do it.

577
00:27:54.382 --> 00:27:55.550
Oh. I'm sure Aaron

578
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:56.843
doesn't want-
- That's great.

579
00:28:01.973 --> 00:28:02.849
All right.

580
00:28:04.768 --> 00:28:05.977
- So-
- I am so sorry.

581
00:28:05.977 --> 00:28:08.772
I just have to. so sorry.

582
00:28:09.939 --> 00:28:11.399
I have to get this. just be...

583
00:28:14.736 --> 00:28:16.154
Connor. not a good time.

584
00:28:16.154 --> 00:28:17.739
It's not a good
time either for me

585
00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:20.450
to have your dad calling
me on my vacation.

586
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:22.327
about as calm as an atomic bomb.

587
00:28:22.327 --> 00:28:23.661
It. it's about the phone call?

588
00:28:23.661 --> 00:28:24.788
Yes.

589
00:28:24.788 --> 00:28:26.623
And to cut your dad's very long

590
00:28:26.623 --> 00:28:29.376
and mildly terrifying
tirade short.

591
00:28:29.376 --> 00:28:30.794
he wants to buy it

592
00:28:30.794 --> 00:28:33.296
and has upped our
available bidding price.

593
00:28:33.296 --> 00:28:34.464
Okay. okay.

594
00:28:34.464 --> 00:28:35.465
I'm. I'm. I'll handle it.

595
00:28:35.465 --> 00:28:36.549
Keep me in the loop.

596
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:38.259
Bye.

597
00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:40.220
I am so sorry.

598
00:28:42.263 --> 00:28:44.432
Okay everyone.
it's countdown time.

599
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.393
Ten.

600
00:28:46.393 --> 00:28:47.686
Nine.

601
00:28:47.686 --> 00:28:49.062
Eight.

602
00:28:49.062 --> 00:28:50.271
Seven.

603
00:28:50.271 --> 00:28:51.231
Six.

604
00:28:51.231 --> 00:28:52.399
Five.
- On one

605
00:28:52.399 --> 00:28:54.067
you can pull the switch.
- Four.

606
00:28:54.067 --> 00:28:54.901
Three.

607
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:55.694
Two.

608
00:28:55.694 --> 00:28:56.778
One.

609
00:29:17.215 --> 00:29:18.299
Wow.

610
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:26.266
Aaron. if I didn't say it
properly before. thank you.

611
00:29:27.976 --> 00:29:29.811
I know you gave up
something big for my family.

612
00:29:29.811 --> 00:29:33.606
and I know I don't
know you that well.

613
00:29:33.606 --> 00:29:36.234
but you're obviously
a really good guy.

614
00:29:36.234 --> 00:29:40.280
so thank you so much.

615
00:29:44.492 --> 00:29:45.827
My pleasure.

616
00:29:57.964 --> 00:29:59.841
It doesn't have
to be this property.

617
00:29:59.841 --> 00:30:01.343
I'll find us something else.

618
00:30:01.343 --> 00:30:02.469
Do the right thing here.

619
00:30:02.469 --> 00:30:03.845
I am doing the right thing.

620
00:30:03.845 --> 00:30:05.472
I'm doing the
right thing for us.

621
00:30:05.472 --> 00:30:07.140
This property means
something to the neighbors.

622
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.808
Yeah. and it means
something to me too.

623
00:30:08.808 --> 00:30:10.477
I mean something
more than money.

624
00:30:10.477 --> 00:30:13.313
Dad. you sent
me here to oversee this

625
00:30:13.313 --> 00:30:15.523
and I'm telling you. it's
not the right decision.

626
00:30:15.523 --> 00:30:17.484
Well. luckily
for the both of us.

627
00:30:17.484 --> 00:30:18.902
you don't make the decisions.

628
00:30:18.902 --> 00:30:20.987
Letting this go is
the right thing to do

629
00:30:20.987 --> 00:30:22.364
and we're gonna do it.

630
00:30:22.364 --> 00:30:23.698
I gotta go.

631
00:30:23.698 --> 00:30:24.616
Talk tomorrow.

632
00:30:33.583 --> 00:30:35.293
Hey.

633
00:30:35.293 --> 00:30:37.837
We are outselling last year.
we need more of everything.

634
00:30:37.837 --> 00:30:39.881
Maybe we should
plant more trees.

635
00:30:42.425 --> 00:30:44.552
Heidi becoming partners is
gonna have growing pains.

636
00:30:44.552 --> 00:30:45.512
It's normal.

637
00:30:46.554 --> 00:30:47.681
We just gotta get through it.

638
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:49.808
I know. I'm just asking you

639
00:30:49.808 --> 00:30:51.810
to consider what's
best for the business.

640
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.103
I am considering it.

641
00:30:54.229 --> 00:30:56.356
I'm just asking
you to do the same.

642
00:30:56.356 --> 00:30:58.942
Ladies. I already told you
I'm not getting involved.

643
00:30:58.942 --> 00:31:00.527
You're gonna have to
figure this out together.

644
00:31:00.527 --> 00:31:02.696
Not only because
you're partners.

645
00:31:02.696 --> 00:31:05.824
but because I won't
always be here.

646
00:31:05.824 --> 00:31:07.784
You won't always be here?

647
00:31:07.784 --> 00:31:10.537
Is there something that
you need to tell us?

648
00:31:10.537 --> 00:31:15.166
I won't be here because
I'm. I'm going back to Italy.

649
00:31:15.166 --> 00:31:18.503
Wow. Ina. back
to Italy already?

650
00:31:18.503 --> 00:31:19.504
Yeah.

651
00:31:26.136 --> 00:31:29.514
"You may have the universe
if I may have Italy."

652
00:31:30.765 --> 00:31:33.393
Yeah. that's
something Leo. uh...

653
00:31:33.393 --> 00:31:36.771
Signore Russo. my. my
tutor. he says that.

654
00:31:36.771 --> 00:31:38.440
Mom. that sounds amazing.

655
00:31:40.275 --> 00:31:45.447
Honey. after 50 years
of. of nonstop work

656
00:31:47.115 --> 00:31:48.616
and. you know. giving everything
to the farm and to you two.

657
00:31:48.616 --> 00:31:50.744
I'm now doing
something for myself.

658
00:31:50.744 --> 00:31:52.245
Well. I support it.

659
00:31:52.245 --> 00:31:55.081
I mean. back to Italy
to eat. pray and love

660
00:31:55.081 --> 00:31:56.583
Except without the love.

661
00:32:00.879 --> 00:32:02.881
I'm happy for you.
it's just different.

662
00:32:02.881 --> 00:32:04.424
Been just you and me here.

663
00:32:04.424 --> 00:32:06.092
And me.

664
00:32:06.092 --> 00:32:07.761
No. no. of course. I just
meant living at the house.

665
00:32:07.761 --> 00:32:09.471
It's different.

666
00:32:09.471 --> 00:32:12.223
No. it. it is going
to be different.

667
00:32:13.558 --> 00:32:18.438
But I need to do this for
myself and I want your support.

668
00:32:18.438 --> 00:32:19.356
Of course. Mom.

669
00:32:20.857 --> 00:32:22.650
I'm just worried about you
being all alone. that's all.

670
00:32:24.152 --> 00:32:27.447
Um. who's doing
the pickup in town?

671
00:32:37.415 --> 00:32:38.249
Hey.

672
00:32:39.376 --> 00:32:40.710
What a coincidence.

673
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.420
Ah. yeah.

674
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.507
Um. also. the town's
a block long. so.

675
00:32:46.633 --> 00:32:47.634
That's right. huh?

676
00:32:48.677 --> 00:32:49.928
Can I help you with something?

677
00:32:49.928 --> 00:32:51.054
Oh. no. that's okay.

678
00:32:51.054 --> 00:32:53.014
Please let me take something.

679
00:32:59.062 --> 00:33:00.230
So what's all this.

680
00:33:01.356 --> 00:33:04.484
Decorations. paper
goods. flowers.

681
00:33:04.484 --> 00:33:07.696
It's all for the Maple
Christmas Fair tomorrow.

682
00:33:07.696 --> 00:33:09.614
We host a big holiday market.

683
00:33:09.614 --> 00:33:11.449
It gets a huge turnout.

684
00:33:11.449 --> 00:33:12.367
You should come.

685
00:33:13.076 --> 00:33:14.661
I wish I could.

686
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:15.704
but I'm on an early
flight tomorrow to Aspen.

687
00:33:16.788 --> 00:33:17.747
Oh. right. yeah.

688
00:33:17.747 --> 00:33:18.665
No. of course.

689
00:33:22.419 --> 00:33:24.879
So. uh. tell me more
about this festival.

690
00:33:24.879 --> 00:33:27.882
Oh. it's an Ina spectacular.

691
00:33:27.882 --> 00:33:29.300
It was my mom's addition

692
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.469
to the Christmas
calendar years ago.

693
00:33:31.469 --> 00:33:35.265
We sell maple goods and then
the local artists from the town

694
00:33:35.265 --> 00:33:38.018
sell their arts. crafts. gifts.

695
00:33:38.018 --> 00:33:39.144
It's a tourist favorite.

696
00:33:39.144 --> 00:33:41.062
And a big revenue stream for us.

697
00:33:41.062 --> 00:33:44.232
Seems like you guys have
a lot of revenue streams.

698
00:33:44.232 --> 00:33:47.068
Yeah. but it's a
matter of necessity.

699
00:33:48.528 --> 00:33:52.157
The maple business took years
to get financially solvent.

700
00:33:53.033 --> 00:33:56.202
And well. we had a few bad years

701
00:33:56.202 --> 00:33:58.788
and when my dad left.

702
00:33:58.788 --> 00:34:00.707
we had to take out a risky loan.

703
00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:04.586
That's why we had to sell the
land to the Fernandez family.

704
00:34:06.254 --> 00:34:07.589
What about your dad?

705
00:34:09.174 --> 00:34:12.886
Oh. you know. Christmas
cards. birthday cards.

706
00:34:12.886 --> 00:34:14.763
Never on our actual birthdays.

707
00:34:16.348 --> 00:34:17.599
It's fine though. we
don't hold it against him.

708
00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:18.641
It's a hard life out here.

709
00:34:18.641 --> 00:34:19.601
It's not for everyone.

710
00:34:21.936 --> 00:34:23.980
So the Fernandez land

711
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.483
is about much more
than just the land.

712
00:34:28.526 --> 00:34:32.280
I guess I sort of see it
as a symbol or something.

713
00:34:33.782 --> 00:34:37.369
Like. like if we get that
land back. we'll be okay.

714
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:40.622
We can erase the parts of
the past we don't want.

715
00:34:42.123 --> 00:34:43.792
But if I'm being totally honest.

716
00:34:43.792 --> 00:34:46.294
my sister's not completely on
board with buying the land.

717
00:34:48.129 --> 00:34:50.715
Oh yeah. business and
family. that can be tough.

718
00:34:52.008 --> 00:34:53.176
Yeah. I guess so.

719
00:34:54.177 --> 00:34:55.637
Didn't used to be though.

720
00:34:57.222 --> 00:34:59.641
I mean. how do you and
your dad make it work?

721
00:35:01.059 --> 00:35:05.605
No. I. I don't
think we make it work.

722
00:35:07.315 --> 00:35:08.650
He gets what he wants.

723
00:35:09.984 --> 00:35:13.405
I back off or give
up or give in.

724
00:35:15.073 --> 00:35:16.241
And he takes that
as me being aimless

725
00:35:16.241 --> 00:35:18.118
or having no follow through.

726
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:25.834
Well.

727
00:35:25.834 --> 00:35:27.043
Here. let me. uh...

728
00:35:27.043 --> 00:35:28.962
It's. it's okay. I got it.

729
00:35:28.962 --> 00:35:30.880
I know you do.

730
00:35:40.265 --> 00:35:41.641
What's going on here?

731
00:35:41.641 --> 00:35:43.309
It's for the Maple
Christmas Fair.

732
00:35:43.309 --> 00:35:44.936
We make all sorts
of maple products.

733
00:35:44.936 --> 00:35:47.313
Mm-hmm. maple
soap. maple candle.

734
00:35:47.313 --> 00:35:49.399
Maple butter. maple candies.

735
00:35:49.399 --> 00:35:52.193
Oh. speaking of candies.
who's doing the candying?

736
00:35:53.403 --> 00:35:55.321
Uh. I don't know
what candying is.

737
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:59.826
but if it's a verb form of
candy. I'll take the job.

738
00:35:59.826 --> 00:36:01.578
Perfect.

739
00:36:01.578 --> 00:36:03.163
You wanna keep an eye
on the candy thermometer.

740
00:36:03.163 --> 00:36:05.832
When it hits 240.
you let it cool.

741
00:36:05.832 --> 00:36:07.208
Then it needs to be stirred.

742
00:36:07.208 --> 00:36:09.794
Here. this one's
ready to be stirred.

743
00:36:09.794 --> 00:36:11.212
Okay.

744
00:36:14.549 --> 00:36:17.844
Now. when you see
the shine on top.

745
00:36:19.262 --> 00:36:21.264
you transfer the syrup.

746
00:36:26.561 --> 00:36:27.937
Ah. it's hot!

747
00:36:27.937 --> 00:36:30.398
Of course it's
hot. it's boiling.

748
00:36:30.398 --> 00:36:32.609
I didn't know it
was gonna be so hot.

749
00:36:32.609 --> 00:36:35.570
There's literally a
thermometer sticking out of it.

750
00:36:37.238 --> 00:36:39.199
Sad to say. it's
in my character.

751
00:36:39.199 --> 00:36:40.742
Tell me there's a
universe out there

752
00:36:40.742 --> 00:36:45.538
that's ever expanding.
and I'll believe you.

753
00:36:45.538 --> 00:36:48.875
but you hang a wet
paint sign on a wall.

754
00:36:49.918 --> 00:36:51.461
I need to touch it to make sure

755
00:37:06.142 --> 00:37:08.978
I won't do that again. okay?

756
00:37:08.978 --> 00:37:09.896
Don't.

757
00:37:19.197 --> 00:37:20.615
For your troubles.

758
00:37:23.368 --> 00:37:25.745
It was. there's no trouble.

759
00:37:25.745 --> 00:37:29.624
Well. then. I
guess. for the road.

760
00:37:40.427 --> 00:37:43.179
Dad. what are you doing here?

761
00:37:43.179 --> 00:37:46.057
I called you and
you didn't answer.

762
00:37:46.057 --> 00:37:48.852
So I went by the inn. and they
said that you might be here.

763
00:37:48.852 --> 00:37:50.562
No. what are you
doing in Maple Valley?

764
00:37:50.562 --> 00:37:52.397
I'm here to look at the land.

765
00:37:52.397 --> 00:37:54.274
You said you weren't bidding.

766
00:38:01.281 --> 00:38:04.075
Erica. this is my dad. Steve.

767
00:38:04.075 --> 00:38:05.368
Steve. this is Erica.

768
00:38:05.368 --> 00:38:06.828
Nice to meet you. Erica.

769
00:38:08.163 --> 00:38:09.497
So you're the neighbor

770
00:38:09.497 --> 00:38:11.332
that's bidding against
us for the land?

771
00:38:12.834 --> 00:38:13.668
That's me.

772
00:38:16.004 --> 00:38:17.589
Well. now I get it.

773
00:38:18.506 --> 00:38:19.716
Can you excuse us?

774
00:38:19.716 --> 00:38:20.675
I'm sorry.

775
00:38:20.675 --> 00:38:22.344
I'll be in touch in a bit. okay?

776
00:38:29.976 --> 00:38:33.188
So you're throwing away this
deal for a woman you just met

777
00:38:33.188 --> 00:38:34.939
that you won't know next week.

778
00:38:34.939 --> 00:38:38.360
No. I'm throwing this deal
because I have principles.

779
00:38:39.819 --> 00:38:41.446
Why are you here?

780
00:38:41.446 --> 00:38:43.740
Because I can't trust your
decision with this land.

781
00:38:45.116 --> 00:38:47.702
So 9:00 AM tomorrow morning.

782
00:38:47.702 --> 00:38:51.122
you and me are going on a
little walk on the property.

783
00:38:54.376 --> 00:38:55.710
What if I'm not there?

784
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.100
You'll be there.

785
00:39:14.062 --> 00:39:15.438
Aaron's dad's here.

786
00:39:16.648 --> 00:39:18.650
Turns out they are still
interested in the land.

787
00:39:19.651 --> 00:39:21.319
Heidi.
- I'm giving it thought.

788
00:39:21.319 --> 00:39:23.196
But I'm still not convinced.

789
00:39:23.196 --> 00:39:25.448
Okay. but we only
have until tomorrow.

790
00:39:25.448 --> 00:39:27.784
Ina. what are we
baking for the fair?

791
00:39:27.784 --> 00:39:32.038
Well. we're gonna bake
some fudge and some babka.

792
00:39:32.038 --> 00:39:36.418
yule log and a recipe of
shortbread that I found.

793
00:39:37.752 --> 00:39:40.922
Girls. still on for
the fudge as usual?

794
00:39:40.922 --> 00:39:43.383
Sure.

795
00:39:43.383 --> 00:39:46.761
So. Ina. what are you
going to do in Italy?

796
00:39:46.761 --> 00:39:51.224
Well. everything that I
didn't get to do last time.

797
00:39:51.224 --> 00:39:55.645
I'm gonna explore all the
north. I'm gonna shop in Milan.

798
00:39:55.645 --> 00:40:00.233
Yeah. visit Lake Como. get lost
in Venice and eat. eat. eat.

799
00:40:00.233 --> 00:40:01.401
Ah. sounds perfect.

800
00:40:01.401 --> 00:40:02.902
I'm so jealous.

801
00:40:02.902 --> 00:40:04.654
Yeah. but won't
you get lonely?

802
00:40:04.654 --> 00:40:07.157
No. no. I. I'm. I'm
not gonna get lonely

803
00:40:08.783 --> 00:40:11.161
because I'm not gonna be alone.

804
00:40:12.495 --> 00:40:14.539
I have wanted to tell
you for some time.

805
00:40:14.539 --> 00:40:16.583
You remember my Italian tutor

806
00:40:16.583 --> 00:40:19.252
from the language
school in Rome.

807
00:40:19.252 --> 00:40:20.628
Signore Russo?

808
00:40:20.628 --> 00:40:22.547
Just kind of happened.

809
00:40:22.547 --> 00:40:24.966
Ina. are you saying you have
a secret Italian boyfriend?

810
00:40:24.966 --> 00:40:30.221
No. I'm. I mean. yes. he
does call himself my boyfriend.

811
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:34.392
Mom. are. are you saying
you're going back to Italy

812
00:40:34.392 --> 00:40:35.977
for a man you met on vacation?

813
00:40:38.271 --> 00:40:39.647
You hardly know him.

814
00:40:39.647 --> 00:40:43.109
Erica. I know him and
I care for him deeply.

815
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:44.819
And with him.

816
00:40:44.819 --> 00:40:47.155
I feel like I'm being given
a second chance for love.

817
00:40:48.156 --> 00:40:49.616
So be happy for me.

818
00:40:49.616 --> 00:40:51.534
We are happy for you.

819
00:40:52.827 --> 00:40:54.454
Really.
- Of course we are.

820
00:40:54.454 --> 00:40:57.040
It's just. doesn't it
seem a little sudden.

821
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.917
a little too good to be true?

822
00:40:58.917 --> 00:40:59.918
Erica.

823
00:40:59.918 --> 00:41:01.336
What?

824
00:41:01.336 --> 00:41:02.462
Just because you
don't want love

825
00:41:02.462 --> 00:41:03.880
doesn't mean Mom can't have it.

826
00:41:06.675 --> 00:41:08.009
Yeah. that's true.

827
00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.471
Sorry. Mom.

828
00:41:11.471 --> 00:41:12.972
That's okay.

829
00:41:15.558 --> 00:41:18.687
You know. we don't really
need two people on fudge.

830
00:41:18.687 --> 00:41:21.022
so I'll just get started
on the shortbread.

831
00:41:32.534 --> 00:41:33.576
He'll be here.

832
00:41:36.788 --> 00:41:37.664
That's him.

833
00:41:47.257 --> 00:41:48.383
Mr. Fernandez.

834
00:41:48.383 --> 00:41:49.342
Aaron Davenport.

835
00:41:49.342 --> 00:41:50.802
My pleasure.

836
00:41:50.802 --> 00:41:52.387
Well. let's get started.

837
00:41:52.387 --> 00:41:54.180
Please. this way.

838
00:42:00.812 --> 00:42:02.272
Ladies.

839
00:42:10.238 --> 00:42:11.072
Hey.
- Hi.

840
00:42:12.574 --> 00:42:15.744
You know. the fair has
always been my favorite.

841
00:42:15.744 --> 00:42:17.203
I'm really gonna miss it.

842
00:42:18.747 --> 00:42:22.292
Erica. we still haven't received
an offer from your family.

843
00:42:22.292 --> 00:42:23.501
Right.

844
00:42:23.501 --> 00:42:24.627
We're working on it.

845
00:42:24.627 --> 00:42:26.713
Yes. but between you and me.

846
00:42:26.713 --> 00:42:29.549
it seems that the
Davenport's are gonna bid

847
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:32.218
and. uh. window closes soon.

848
00:42:32.218 --> 00:42:33.970
Well. we're bidding too.

849
00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.973
We're offering asking price.
standard contingencies.

850
00:42:36.973 --> 00:42:39.934
Good. send it as
soon as you can.

851
00:42:39.934 --> 00:42:40.977
Of course.

852
00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:50.278
Oh. look at this turnout.

853
00:42:50.278 --> 00:42:52.572
I know. it's
incredible. right?

854
00:42:52.572 --> 00:42:54.199
Heidi. can I steal
you for a second?

855
00:42:54.199 --> 00:42:59.120
Ooh. your gentleman
caller is here.

856
00:43:02.999 --> 00:43:05.627
I'm sorry. I. she
got it out of me.

857
00:43:05.627 --> 00:43:07.253
- Hello. hi.
- Hi.

858
00:43:07.253 --> 00:43:08.755
Um. what can I get you?

859
00:43:08.755 --> 00:43:10.423
We have maple shortbread.

860
00:43:10.423 --> 00:43:11.424
We have maple babka.

861
00:43:11.424 --> 00:43:13.468
We have maple fudge.

862
00:43:13.468 --> 00:43:14.928
It's a lot of maple.

863
00:43:14.928 --> 00:43:17.263
What we wouldn't give
to live on cacao farm.

864
00:43:19.599 --> 00:43:20.642
Can we speak?

865
00:43:29.984 --> 00:43:31.444
I'm sorry.

866
00:43:31.444 --> 00:43:33.571
I told my dad we shouldn't bid.

867
00:43:33.571 --> 00:43:35.990
I pushed it. but ultimately
it's not my decision.

868
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:38.910
It's his. and I guess
he's still deciding.

869
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:40.829
Well. thanks for
letting me know.

870
00:43:41.579 --> 00:43:44.040
And have fun in Aspen.

871
00:43:47.002 --> 00:43:48.586
I'm actually gonna stay here

872
00:43:48.586 --> 00:43:49.754
until this thing
gets figured out.

873
00:43:53.091 --> 00:43:54.718
And besides. I gotta.

874
00:43:54.718 --> 00:43:56.428
I gotta get my last minute
Christmas shopping in.

875
00:44:01.141 --> 00:44:03.059
Who you shopping for?

876
00:44:05.103 --> 00:44:06.938
I gotta get
something for my dad.

877
00:44:08.064 --> 00:44:09.691
I'm just not sure
this is his jam.

878
00:44:10.859 --> 00:44:12.402
Yeah. well. our booth
selling money bags.

879
00:44:12.402 --> 00:44:15.363
bowties and top hats couldn't
make it this year. so.

880
00:44:16.781 --> 00:44:18.742
Oh. because he's
the Monopoly Man.

881
00:44:21.536 --> 00:44:22.996
Sorry.

882
00:44:22.996 --> 00:44:25.915
No. sadly. it's.
it's kind of true.

883
00:44:27.042 --> 00:44:28.293
Maybe I should
get him a monocle.

884
00:44:30.295 --> 00:44:31.921
What will he get you?

885
00:44:31.921 --> 00:44:34.466
Oh. he is gonna
get me something
generous and expensive.

886
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:38.386
but not necessarily meaningful.

887
00:44:38.386 --> 00:44:40.096
You want something meaningful.

888
00:44:41.222 --> 00:44:42.724
Yeah. that would be nice.

889
00:44:44.893 --> 00:44:46.311
It's been a while.

890
00:44:48.855 --> 00:44:50.857
I think the last
meaningful gift that I got

891
00:44:50.857 --> 00:44:52.692
was when I was five
or six years old.

892
00:44:52.692 --> 00:44:57.113
It was this fire truck.
I wanted it so badly.

893
00:44:58.948 --> 00:45:01.451
When I saw it under the
tree Christmas morning.

894
00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.414
it made all these noises.

895
00:45:06.414 --> 00:45:10.335
sirens and firemen were talking.

896
00:45:11.252 --> 00:45:12.087
I loved it.

897
00:45:13.588 --> 00:45:14.881
Then what happened?

898
00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:16.591
Then it stopped making noise

899
00:45:16.591 --> 00:45:19.886
and. and I stopped
playing with it.

900
00:45:27.227 --> 00:45:28.311
Hey.

901
00:45:28.311 --> 00:45:29.479
- Hi.
- Hi.

902
00:45:29.479 --> 00:45:31.815
Hi. do you know if Erica

903
00:45:31.815 --> 00:45:34.067
is planning on sending
that email soon.

904
00:45:34.067 --> 00:45:35.193
What email?

905
00:45:35.193 --> 00:45:36.111
The offer.

906
00:45:47.789 --> 00:45:50.041
You made an offer
behind my back?

907
00:45:51.042 --> 00:45:52.502
What?

908
00:45:52.502 --> 00:45:55.171
Andres said you were sending
him an email with an offer.

909
00:45:55.171 --> 00:45:56.840
I'm sorry.

910
00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.258
I. I was just about to
come talk to you about it.

911
00:45:58.258 --> 00:45:59.592
I just didn't want us
to lose the opportunity.

912
00:45:59.592 --> 00:46:01.177
No. this is not about us.

913
00:46:01.177 --> 00:46:02.470
This is about you.

914
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:04.180
But you did lose

915
00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:07.392
because the Davenport's just
bid way over asking price.

916
00:46:23.658 --> 00:46:24.534
Hey.

917
00:46:26.578 --> 00:46:28.121
You still mad at me?

918
00:46:28.121 --> 00:46:28.997
Yep.

919
00:46:32.375 --> 00:46:34.294
Well. I will say it again.

920
00:46:34.294 --> 00:46:36.921
From the bottom of
my heart. I am sorry.

921
00:46:37.756 --> 00:46:38.923
I wanted the land so badly.

922
00:46:38.923 --> 00:46:41.217
I made a big mistake.

923
00:46:43.678 --> 00:46:44.804
I don't know. Erica.

924
00:46:44.804 --> 00:46:46.973
I. I think the fact is.

925
00:46:46.973 --> 00:46:50.685
is that even though we're
supposed to be partners now.

926
00:46:50.685 --> 00:46:52.687
you still just see me
as your little sister.

927
00:46:52.687 --> 00:46:54.230
Well. I can be better.

928
00:46:55.607 --> 00:46:56.483
Okay?

929
00:46:58.693 --> 00:46:59.611
Okay.

930
00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.615
How are you feeling
about the Davenport's

931
00:47:03.615 --> 00:47:05.909
buying the Fernandez land?

932
00:47:05.909 --> 00:47:06.993
Not great.

933
00:47:07.786 --> 00:47:09.162
Yeah.

934
00:47:09.162 --> 00:47:10.747
I mean. I know it's
not Aaron's fault.

935
00:47:10.747 --> 00:47:13.249
but I still just
wanna scream at him.

936
00:47:17.003 --> 00:47:19.005
Well. uh. here
is your opportunity

937
00:47:19.005 --> 00:47:21.341
because he just pulled up.

938
00:47:21.341 --> 00:47:22.175
What?

939
00:47:22.175 --> 00:47:23.134
Yeah.

940
00:47:24.302 --> 00:47:27.013
Or. other option. I
could go to the barn

941
00:47:27.013 --> 00:47:28.682
and get the sleigh
ready for tomorrow.

942
00:47:28.682 --> 00:47:30.558
You're going out the back.

943
00:47:30.558 --> 00:47:32.310
Just tell him I'm not here.

944
00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:37.565
You don't wanna be mature
and try to talk to him or...

945
00:47:38.191 --> 00:47:39.234
No.

946
00:47:39.234 --> 00:47:40.193
No?

947
00:47:40.193 --> 00:47:41.111
No.

948
00:47:45.573 --> 00:47:48.952
Hey. Erica is not here.

949
00:47:51.996 --> 00:47:53.331
Is she in the barn?

950
00:47:53.331 --> 00:47:54.541
Yeah.

951
00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:55.959
Yeah. she's in the barn.

952
00:47:58.253 --> 00:47:59.129
Thanks. Heidi.

953
00:48:00.338 --> 00:48:01.172
Yeah.

954
00:48:09.889 --> 00:48:11.433
How's hiding from me going?

955
00:48:13.059 --> 00:48:14.853
I'm not hiding.

956
00:48:14.853 --> 00:48:17.063
I'm working.

957
00:48:17.856 --> 00:48:18.940
Oh. yeah.

958
00:48:22.152 --> 00:48:24.154
What are you
still doing in town?

959
00:48:25.447 --> 00:48:28.450
I'm purposely
obfuscating the contract.

960
00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:29.451
Don't tell my dad.

961
00:48:31.911 --> 00:48:34.372
So you're moonlighting as Santa?

962
00:48:34.372 --> 00:48:37.250
Is this another
Holden revenue stream?

963
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:39.127
It's for our horse
drawn sleigh ride

964
00:48:39.127 --> 00:48:40.462
which starts tomorrow.

965
00:48:41.838 --> 00:48:42.922
We take guests out to
a cabin in the woods.

966
00:48:42.922 --> 00:48:44.966
serve them a prime rib dinner.

967
00:48:44.966 --> 00:48:46.968
Well. can I. can I help?

968
00:48:46.968 --> 00:48:48.094
Thanks. but I...

969
00:48:49.429 --> 00:48:50.638
I'm just about finished.

970
00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.477
Erica. I'm sorry.

971
00:48:55.477 --> 00:48:59.606
I tried. I just. my dad
doesn't listen to me.

972
00:48:59.606 --> 00:49:01.316
Then why do you work for him?

973
00:49:02.817 --> 00:49:05.695
I'm sorry. it's
just. it's your life.

974
00:49:07.155 --> 00:49:08.365
What are you doing with it?

975
00:49:08.365 --> 00:49:10.033
I don't know.

976
00:49:10.033 --> 00:49:11.659
But you don't think I ask
myself that every day?

977
00:49:11.659 --> 00:49:13.787
You don't think that I. I
know that I'm wasting my life

978
00:49:13.787 --> 00:49:15.413
trying to make my dad happy

979
00:49:15.413 --> 00:49:16.956
because I don't know
what would make me happy.

980
00:49:16.956 --> 00:49:18.375
Why don't you quit?

981
00:49:18.375 --> 00:49:20.210
Because this has
always been the plan.

982
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:22.837
Ever since I was 10 years old.
to take over the business.

983
00:49:22.837 --> 00:49:25.215
I can't. I can't
just quit on him.

984
00:49:27.509 --> 00:49:29.678
I also don't know
what else I would do.

985
00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.099
Do you wanna go for a ride?

986
00:49:37.852 --> 00:49:39.062
Can I wear the hat?

987
00:49:41.815 --> 00:49:43.692
I can't even get a pity hat.

988
00:49:44.651 --> 00:49:45.527
Wow.

989
00:49:46.945 --> 00:49:48.238
You're tough.

990
00:49:53.743 --> 00:49:54.661
What?

991
00:49:57.163 --> 00:50:01.167
I can almost remember
being here with my mom.

992
00:50:02.377 --> 00:50:05.380
Not an actual memory.
but just a. a feeling

993
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.841
of how much she
would've loved it here.

994
00:50:07.841 --> 00:50:09.718
Wanted to move to horse country.

995
00:50:11.052 --> 00:50:12.429
My dad didn't want to.

996
00:50:14.055 --> 00:50:16.433
so she would just take me
riding every chance you got.

997
00:50:17.434 --> 00:50:18.560
'Til she got sick.

998
00:50:19.853 --> 00:50:21.187
How old were you?

999
00:50:21.187 --> 00:50:23.189
I was 10 when she passed.

1000
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.276
Too young.

1001
00:50:27.736 --> 00:50:30.071
It's always too young
to have your heart broken.

1002
00:50:54.012 --> 00:50:55.388
I'm still curious

1003
00:50:55.388 --> 00:50:57.265
just to know why you're
not dating anyone.

1004
00:50:57.265 --> 00:51:01.102
Oh. I wouldn't say it's
why. but I was married.

1005
00:51:02.103 --> 00:51:03.730
I got divorced four years ago.

1006
00:51:05.357 --> 00:51:06.524
It's fine.

1007
00:51:06.524 --> 00:51:09.069
He was one of those
adrenaline seeking

1008
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:11.363
four season sports kind of guys.

1009
00:51:11.363 --> 00:51:13.490
led trekking trips
across the country.

1010
00:51:14.657 --> 00:51:17.243
Came out here looking
for the Wild West.

1011
00:51:18.912 --> 00:51:20.330
Did he find it?

1012
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:22.165
I don't know what he found.

1013
00:51:23.333 --> 00:51:24.626
Whatever it was.
it wasn't enough.

1014
00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.255
Little house. little
farm. little life.

1015
00:51:30.799 --> 00:51:31.758
He got bored of it.

1016
00:51:33.218 --> 00:51:34.260
Got bored of me.

1017
00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:37.222
That's not possible.

1018
00:51:41.935 --> 00:51:42.811
What about you?

1019
00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.647
Divorces. breakups?

1020
00:51:46.773 --> 00:51:47.857
Opportunity to trauma bond.

1021
00:51:50.694 --> 00:51:52.070
Nah. I don't know.

1022
00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:54.114
No real. I mean. couple
long relationships.

1023
00:51:54.114 --> 00:51:56.533
but nothing too serious.

1024
00:51:57.492 --> 00:51:58.743
Why not?

1025
00:51:58.743 --> 00:51:59.661
I don't know.

1026
00:52:02.706 --> 00:52:06.084
Maybe my dad was right. maybe
I have no follow through.

1027
00:52:08.586 --> 00:52:10.422
Maybe you'll
have follow through

1028
00:52:10.422 --> 00:52:12.882
when you find something you
wanna follow through on.

1029
00:52:15.301 --> 00:52:16.970
It's getting dark.

1030
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:18.638
I have to get back.

1031
00:52:18.638 --> 00:52:20.640
My family does this pioneer
Christmas thing tonight.

1032
00:52:24.894 --> 00:52:26.438
What's that?

1033
00:52:26.438 --> 00:52:30.275
Like blacksmithing and
cholera. but make it Christmas.

1034
00:52:30.275 --> 00:52:33.278
Exactly.

1035
00:52:40.452 --> 00:52:42.120
Sausages.

1036
00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.039
campfire spuds.

1037
00:52:44.039 --> 00:52:45.957
Okay. you gotta eat up. Aaron.

1038
00:52:45.957 --> 00:52:47.417
Put some meat on those bones.

1039
00:52:47.417 --> 00:52:48.710
If there's not enough.

1040
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:49.836
I don't have to-
- Oh. no.

1041
00:52:49.836 --> 00:52:51.296
there's more than enough.

1042
00:52:51.296 --> 00:52:53.048
And we're happy
to have you here.

1043
00:52:53.048 --> 00:52:56.551
You know. Mom started pioneer
Christmas when we were kids.

1044
00:52:56.551 --> 00:52:58.470
to honor our great-grandparents

1045
00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:00.847
who didn't have a working
stove their first Christmas.

1046
00:53:00.847 --> 00:53:04.684
So they cooked holiday
dinner over an open fire.

1047
00:53:04.684 --> 00:53:06.394
But really.

1048
00:53:06.394 --> 00:53:07.896
we think Mom just wanted
a night off of the dishes.

1049
00:53:11.232 --> 00:53:14.778
So before I leave.
I want you to meet Leo

1050
00:53:14.778 --> 00:53:17.739
so I suggested he come
here for Christmas.

1051
00:53:19.741 --> 00:53:20.658
This Christmas?

1052
00:53:20.658 --> 00:53:21.868
Yeah.

1053
00:53:21.868 --> 00:53:23.912
But it's always just us.

1054
00:53:25.038 --> 00:53:25.955
It's. it's tradition.

1055
00:53:25.955 --> 00:53:27.624
It's practically a rule.

1056
00:53:28.416 --> 00:53:30.210
It's just family.

1057
00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:32.045
But things change.

1058
00:53:32.045 --> 00:53:34.422
I want you to meet him.

1059
00:53:34.422 --> 00:53:36.549
I mean. I'd wanna meet the man

1060
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:38.760
that you were uprooting
your life for.

1061
00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:43.765
Mom. your trip to Italy's.

1062
00:53:45.725 --> 00:53:47.477
not just a visit. is it?

1063
00:54:09.332 --> 00:54:10.959
Have you seen Mom?

1064
00:54:10.959 --> 00:54:13.920
I think she's on her
way back from the airport.

1065
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.380
Wow.

1066
00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:17.549
So this is really
happening then.

1067
00:54:18.717 --> 00:54:21.761
And it's happening
sooner than we thought.

1068
00:54:34.691 --> 00:54:36.943
Here's Leo.

1069
00:54:36.943 --> 00:54:38.111
Mwah. mwah.

1070
00:54:38.111 --> 00:54:40.280
I am so happy to be here.

1071
00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.574
And in time for the sleigh ride.

1072
00:54:43.491 --> 00:54:45.326
I was afraid I'd missed it.

1073
00:54:45.326 --> 00:54:46.745
No. no. no. you have
plenty of time to settle in

1074
00:54:46.745 --> 00:54:48.955
before the sleigh ride?
- Oh. good.

1075
00:54:48.955 --> 00:54:52.542
Mom. when you said that Leo
would be coming for Christmas.

1076
00:54:52.542 --> 00:54:55.295
I didn't know you meant today.

1077
00:54:55.295 --> 00:54:57.630
Well. Christmas
is three days away.

1078
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:59.674
If he's gonna come.
now's the time.

1079
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.010
Yeah. I. I guess so.

1080
00:55:03.845 --> 00:55:06.931
Erica. I know this
is difficult for
you and I know why.

1081
00:55:08.183 --> 00:55:09.601
But please.

1082
00:55:10.977 --> 00:55:11.853
pull it together.

1083
00:55:24.157 --> 00:55:26.618
Should we keep
waiting for him?

1084
00:55:26.618 --> 00:55:27.494
No.

1085
00:55:29.371 --> 00:55:30.955
Follow me.

1086
00:55:35.126 --> 00:55:36.002
Hey there.

1087
00:55:38.713 --> 00:55:40.090
You here for the sleigh ride?

1088
00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:41.007
Do you have room?

1089
00:55:42.717 --> 00:55:44.844
Not in the back. but in front

1090
00:55:44.844 --> 00:55:46.262
if you wanna work?

1091
00:55:46.262 --> 00:55:48.348
Yeah. I do have
to earn that hat.

1092
00:55:48.348 --> 00:55:51.393
You
can wear this one.

1093
00:55:56.189 --> 00:55:57.482
All right.

1094
00:55:57.482 --> 00:55:59.317
Hello. everyone.

1095
00:55:59.317 --> 00:56:01.236
Welcome to the 55th annual

1096
00:56:01.236 --> 00:56:02.987
Maple Valley
Christmas sleigh ride.

1097
00:56:02.987 --> 00:56:05.990
Now technically we've been
doing this ride for 55 years.

1098
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:08.618
My family has been doing
it for over a century.

1099
00:56:08.618 --> 00:56:10.704
ever since my
great-grandparents came here

1100
00:56:10.704 --> 00:56:14.457
and come winter discovered
there were no roads.

1101
00:56:14.457 --> 00:56:15.875
Probably why it was affordable.

1102
00:56:15.875 --> 00:56:19.087
Now please keep your
arms and legs inside.

1103
00:56:19.087 --> 00:56:22.340
And I hope you're hungry.
because we are off.

1104
00:56:34.477 --> 00:56:35.895
Will you give me a turn?

1105
00:56:35.895 --> 00:56:37.230
Oh. you think you
can handle this?

1106
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:39.190
Oh yeah. I can handle it.

1107
00:56:46.573 --> 00:56:48.533
Keep the rein's
taut. no slack.

1108
00:56:49.743 --> 00:56:51.619
Don't try to force
it. just feel it.

1109
00:56:52.787 --> 00:56:54.664
It's not about them
listening to you.

1110
00:56:54.664 --> 00:56:57.417
it's about you
listening to each other.

1111
00:56:57.417 --> 00:56:58.960
connecting.

1112
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:13.975
You're doing great.

1113
00:57:15.101 --> 00:57:16.436
Of course I'm doing great.

1114
00:57:16.436 --> 00:57:17.812

I am kinda like an annoyingly
positive magic eight ball.

1137
00:58:40.353 --> 00:58:41.604
It's not annoying.

1138
00:58:42.814 --> 00:58:43.690
I love it.

1139
00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:55.076
But yes. I was. uh. I was
gonna say all those things.

1140
00:58:55.076 --> 00:58:56.870
Well. they'd all be true.

1141
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:59.205
I mean. it is special. right?

1142
00:59:00.832 --> 00:59:03.168
You know. my grandfather used
to love hosting this event.

1143
00:59:04.544 --> 00:59:06.963
It's amazing seeing what
it's grown into today.

1144
00:59:06.963 --> 00:59:09.299
We had to move it out here
to the barrel room years ago.

1145
00:59:09.299 --> 00:59:10.842
just to make space.

1146
00:59:10.842 --> 00:59:12.761
It's a great place
to host a dinner.

1147
00:59:12.761 --> 00:59:14.512
That was my
grandfather's idea.

1148
00:59:14.512 --> 00:59:15.847
You know. he used to insist

1149
00:59:15.847 --> 00:59:18.516
on cooking the
entire meal himself.

1150
00:59:18.516 --> 00:59:20.143
Or else rope me
into helping him.

1151
00:59:20.143 --> 00:59:22.687
but I enjoyed every
minute of it of course.

1152
00:59:25.607 --> 00:59:28.902
You really do
love what you do.

1153
00:59:28.902 --> 00:59:29.778
I do.

1154
00:59:31.196 --> 00:59:32.113
You should too.

1155
00:59:33.406 --> 00:59:35.950
I mean. I. I
love aspects of it.

1156
00:59:37.952 --> 00:59:41.206
I love building
something from the ground up.

1157
00:59:42.791 --> 00:59:46.878
I love the problem
solving. the creativity.

1158
00:59:49.839 --> 00:59:52.967
I just don't love the
projects my dad picks

1159
00:59:54.928 --> 00:59:57.972
or working with him on them.

1160
01:00:01.726 --> 01:00:03.311
But I really do like the work.

1161
01:00:05.647 --> 01:00:08.650

- You know.

1174
01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:12.297
ever since I've met you.

1175
01:01:12.297 --> 01:01:13.840
I feel different.

1176
01:01:18.094 --> 01:01:20.138
What do you mean?

1177
01:01:20.138 --> 01:01:24.976
I don't know. I. when I'm
with you. I. I feel found.

1178
01:01:59.052 --> 01:01:59.928
Come in.

1179
01:02:04.683 --> 01:02:06.017
Where were you today?

1180
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:09.437
You just don't show up.

1181
01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.356
You're selfish.

1182
01:02:11.356 --> 01:02:12.357
I'm selfish?

1183
01:02:12.357 --> 01:02:13.483
Yeah. you're selfish.

1184
01:02:13.483 --> 01:02:14.442
Yeah?

1185
01:02:15.985 --> 01:02:18.780
Remember that Christmas
you got me that fire truck?

1186
01:02:20.031 --> 01:02:21.199
Vaguely.

1187
01:02:21.199 --> 01:02:22.867
It made all these
cool noises. I loved it.

1188
01:02:22.867 --> 01:02:24.786
I played with it for six months.

1189
01:02:26.162 --> 01:02:28.623
Then all of a sudden it
just stopped making noise.

1190
01:02:28.623 --> 01:02:32.043
I asked you what happened to
it and you said it was broken.

1191
01:02:33.336 --> 01:02:34.504
Okay.

1192
01:02:34.504 --> 01:02:35.463
You know Mom.

1193
01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:40.885
I mean. she kept. she kept
all my old toys in that chest.

1194
01:02:44.472 --> 01:02:46.725
Well. I came across
that firetruck.

1195
01:02:46.725 --> 01:02:48.435
had a note attached to it

1196
01:02:48.435 --> 01:02:51.521
that said. "Debbie. don't
replace the batteries.

1197
01:02:51.521 --> 01:02:53.398
Tell Aaron it's broken.

1198
01:02:53.398 --> 01:02:54.315
It's annoying."

1199
01:02:57.902 --> 01:03:00.238
Okay. I made some mistakes.

1200
01:03:00.238 --> 01:03:01.865
but I'm just trying
to teach you-

1201
01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:04.200
I didn't need to be taught.

1202
01:03:07.287 --> 01:03:08.455
I needed to be loved.

1203
01:03:16.421 --> 01:03:17.922
I'm gonna get back to work.

1204
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.467
I think you've taught me well.

1205
01:03:33.897 --> 01:03:35.440
Ah. buongiorno.

1206
01:03:36.524 --> 01:03:37.942
Good morning.

1207
01:03:42.322 --> 01:03:43.198
Thanks.

1208
01:03:45.575 --> 01:03:47.077
Where's my mom?

1209
01:03:47.077 --> 01:03:49.204
I think she's
still sleeping in.

1210
01:03:50.205 --> 01:03:51.373
Oh. okay.

1211
01:03:52.707 --> 01:03:54.376
You're up early.

1212
01:03:54.376 --> 01:03:56.044
Not really.

1213
01:03:56.044 --> 01:03:59.631
It's 16 o'clock in Italy and
two days before Christmas.

1214
01:03:59.631 --> 01:04:04.094
We have a lot to do. make
a menu and shop and cook.

1215
01:04:04.094 --> 01:04:06.638
It's all about
food for me always.

1216
01:04:06.638 --> 01:04:09.182
but especially the holidays.

1217
01:04:09.182 --> 01:04:13.353
Maybe we should talk about
the Christmas Eve dinner menu.

1218
01:04:13.353 --> 01:04:18.441
We have a tradition in Italy.
The Feast of the Seven Fishes.

1219
01:04:18.441 --> 01:04:21.986
La Vigilia. all fish dishes.

1220
01:04:23.196 --> 01:04:26.282
Wow. that sounds.
it's a lot of fish.

1221
01:04:26.282 --> 01:04:29.619
Um. it's just. normally
for Christmas Eve.

1222
01:04:29.619 --> 01:04:31.371
we do maple everything.

1223
01:04:31.371 --> 01:04:34.040
Maple glazed ham.
maple Brussels sprouts.

1224
01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:37.961
I could do a maple salmon. hm?

1225
01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:40.171
The feast of one fish.

1226
01:04:42.215 --> 01:04:43.675
Yeah.

1227
01:04:43.675 --> 01:04:46.511
Um. you know. we could. we
could discuss that more.

1228
01:04:46.511 --> 01:04:50.015
But. you know. I've gotta.
just gotta get to town

1229
01:04:50.015 --> 01:04:51.850
and. and do some last
minute Christmas shopping.

1230
01:04:51.850 --> 01:04:55.770
Yes. of course.

1231
01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:57.397
Right. okay.

1232
01:04:57.397 --> 01:05:02.444
Ciao.

1233
01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.616
Erica.

1234
01:05:08.616 --> 01:05:10.452
Hey.

1235
01:05:11.619 --> 01:05:13.204
Still Christmas shopping?

1236
01:05:14.414 --> 01:05:16.207
Yeah. just picking
up my dad's present.

1237
01:05:17.292 --> 01:05:18.209
How about you?

1238
01:05:18.209 --> 01:05:19.544
You got your hands full there.

1239
01:05:19.544 --> 01:05:21.963
Uh. yeah. last minute errands.

1240
01:05:23.048 --> 01:05:25.091
Do you have a minute to talk?

1241
01:05:25.091 --> 01:05:27.469
I have something I want
to discuss with you.

1242
01:05:29.137 --> 01:05:30.013
Yeah.

1243
01:05:31.222 --> 01:05:34.225
So you remember how
you told me last night

1244
01:05:34.225 --> 01:05:36.686
how I should start my own firm?

1245
01:05:36.686 --> 01:05:37.645
Sure.

1246
01:05:39.272 --> 01:05:41.483
Well. I've been
thinking about it.

1247
01:05:41.483 --> 01:05:44.110
how I have my access to
financing. my network.

1248
01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:45.320
and then it hit me.

1249
01:05:46.863 --> 01:05:49.449
My dad. he. he hasn't signed
the contract for the land yet.

1250
01:05:50.325 --> 01:05:51.826
He hasn't put the deposit down.

1251
01:05:51.826 --> 01:05:53.244
He's done the walkthrough

1252
01:05:53.244 --> 01:05:55.080
and. and is waiting
on the surveyor.

1253
01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.750
So technically. other offers
can still be accepted.

1254
01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:00.502
Aaron. I can't
outbid your dad.

1255
01:06:01.461 --> 01:06:03.463
But what if you could?

1256
01:06:14.015 --> 01:06:15.350
What are you guys doing?

1257
01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:18.019
Your mom. she
made a sock for me.

1258
01:06:18.853 --> 01:06:21.231
A stocking. honey. stocking.

1259
01:06:21.231 --> 01:06:23.066
We thought while they
were hanging the stockings

1260
01:06:23.066 --> 01:06:24.526
that we could stuff them.

1261
01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:27.737
Heidi. could I talk
to you for a minute?

1262
01:06:27.737 --> 01:06:28.697
Yeah.

1263
01:06:33.702 --> 01:06:35.870
Listen. I just saw Aaron.

1264
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:38.248
and I know it sounds
a little weird.

1265
01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:40.750
but he wants to help
us buy the land.

1266
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:44.295
as like a silent partner or
a guarantor or something.

1267
01:06:44.295 --> 01:06:46.172
See. then the land
would cost less

1268
01:06:46.172 --> 01:06:48.258
and we'd have more capital left
over for your business plan.

1269
01:06:48.258 --> 01:06:50.218
Erica. I said no to the land.

1270
01:06:50.218 --> 01:06:51.845
And then you went and
got Aaron involved.

1271
01:06:51.845 --> 01:06:54.597
No. no. it was
entirely Aaron's idea.

1272
01:06:54.597 --> 01:06:59.019
Yeah. maybe. okay. but it
still feels disrespectful to me.

1273
01:06:59.019 --> 01:07:00.437
How?

1274
01:07:00.437 --> 01:07:02.188
It has nothing to
do with respect.

1275
01:07:02.188 --> 01:07:03.982
You know. this
is the same issue

1276
01:07:03.982 --> 01:07:06.526
that we've had our entire lives.

1277
01:07:06.526 --> 01:07:08.403
where you're the big
sister and you know best.

1278
01:07:08.403 --> 01:07:10.864
and you get to
decide everything.

1279
01:07:10.864 --> 01:07:12.032
where you and Mom are a team

1280
01:07:12.032 --> 01:07:13.199
and I'm just...

1281
01:07:14.826 --> 01:07:15.702
What?

1282
01:07:17.078 --> 01:07:19.080
I didn't know
you felt that way.

1283
01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.415
Yeah. well. I do.

1284
01:07:21.916 --> 01:07:24.252
And I also feel like
you don't listen to me.

1285
01:07:24.252 --> 01:07:26.463
We're supposed to partners.

1286
01:07:26.463 --> 01:07:29.424
I'm beginning to wonder if
we're even capable of that.

1287
01:07:53.573 --> 01:07:54.908
How'd the survey go?

1288
01:07:54.908 --> 01:07:56.242
Good. yeah. it's a go.

1289
01:07:56.242 --> 01:07:57.702
Just waiting on the report.

1290
01:07:57.702 --> 01:07:59.537
And once I get it. I'll
send the deposit over.

1291
01:07:59.537 --> 01:08:01.706
Dad. I'm. I'm asking
you one last time

1292
01:08:01.706 --> 01:08:03.166
not to move forward with this.

1293
01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:04.626
And I'm telling you. no.

1294
01:08:06.836 --> 01:08:08.254
Then I quit.

1295
01:08:08.254 --> 01:08:09.881
Oh. come on Aaron.
you're not gonna quit.

1296
01:08:09.881 --> 01:08:11.633
This company's gonna
be yours one day.

1297
01:08:12.634 --> 01:08:13.718
I don't want it.

1298
01:08:13.718 --> 01:08:15.387
Of course you do.

1299
01:08:15.387 --> 01:08:17.347
because that's been the
point of this whole thing.

1300
01:08:17.347 --> 01:08:21.601
All my hard work to make sure
that even when I'm not there.

1301
01:08:21.601 --> 01:08:22.602
you'll be taken care of.

1302
01:08:22.602 --> 01:08:23.520
No. it's not.

1303
01:08:24.396 --> 01:08:26.106
You didn't do this for me.

1304
01:08:26.106 --> 01:08:27.399
You did this for you.

1305
01:08:34.322 --> 01:08:39.411
You know. I don't know how to
fix things between you and I.

1306
01:08:40.912 --> 01:08:43.540
but I know it starts with me
not working for you anymore.

1307
01:08:59.848 --> 01:09:01.516
I thought I'd find you here.

1308
01:09:03.018 --> 01:09:03.935
I got some news.

1309
01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:10.817
In today's episode of Davenport
Drama. I told my dad I quit.

1310
01:09:10.817 --> 01:09:11.693
Wow.

1311
01:09:13.278 --> 01:09:14.237
And we probably only
have until tomorrow morning

1312
01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:15.405
to make an offer.

1313
01:09:15.405 --> 01:09:16.823
Yeah. right. um. about that.

1314
01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:20.035
Thank you for trying and
all the effort you put in.

1315
01:09:20.035 --> 01:09:23.580
but we're not gonna do it.

1316
01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.414
Why not?

1317
01:09:24.414 --> 01:09:26.166
Heidi doesn't want to.

1318
01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:27.459
And she's right.

1319
01:09:28.376 --> 01:09:29.669
It's an emotional decision.

1320
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:31.004
Yeah. but sometimes
those decisions

1321
01:09:31.004 --> 01:09:32.714
lead to the best decisions.

1322
01:09:32.714 --> 01:09:34.549
And sometimes they're the
decisions that we regret.

1323
01:09:34.549 --> 01:09:35.925
The ones we wish we could
run away from or undo.

1324
01:09:35.925 --> 01:09:38.345
the ones that leave you bored.

1325
01:09:39.721 --> 01:09:40.597
I'm not your ex.

1326
01:09:41.556 --> 01:09:42.390
I know that.

1327
01:09:44.017 --> 01:09:46.394
But you're still...

1328
01:09:49.314 --> 01:09:52.233
Go on. I'm still.
I'm still what?

1329
01:09:56.571 --> 01:09:58.531
You're a rich kid who's lost

1330
01:09:58.531 --> 01:10:00.116
and thinks he'll find himself

1331
01:10:00.116 --> 01:10:01.701
by putting on a Stetson
and playing cowboy.

1332
01:10:03.703 --> 01:10:05.330
Look. I support you
finding yourself.

1333
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:07.457
But whatever it is
you're looking for.

1334
01:10:08.833 --> 01:10:10.460
you're not gonna find it here.

1335
01:10:12.003 --> 01:10:13.672
Maybe you don't
pick the wrong guys.

1336
01:10:13.672 --> 01:10:17.425
Maybe you pick the right guys
and just drive them away.

1337
01:10:18.927 --> 01:10:19.844
Maybe I do.

1338
01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:23.473
But like I said. I
don't date tourists.

1339
01:10:34.275 --> 01:10:35.652
You know. I was
trying to figure out

1340
01:10:35.652 --> 01:10:37.487
what I had to do
to earn that hat.

1341
01:10:38.905 --> 01:10:42.492
But I realized you were
never gonna gimme that hat.

1342
01:11:35.503 --> 01:11:37.505
Oh. come decorate.

1343
01:11:37.505 --> 01:11:39.382
But we already decorated.

1344
01:11:39.382 --> 01:11:41.468
Leo brought his family
ornaments from Italy.

1345
01:11:41.468 --> 01:11:42.927
so we're adding them.

1346
01:11:42.927 --> 01:11:45.388
But we always do the
tree a certain way.

1347
01:11:45.388 --> 01:11:46.973
It's just a tree.

1348
01:11:46.973 --> 01:11:48.350
It's not just a tree.

1349
01:11:49.184 --> 01:11:50.643
It's a way things are.

1350
01:11:50.643 --> 01:11:52.270
It's a way things
have always been.

1351
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:53.688
a way they're supposed
to continue being.

1352
01:11:54.522 --> 01:11:56.358
Okay. honey. but things change

1353
01:11:56.358 --> 01:11:58.943
and. and we're gonna move
through this together.

1354
01:11:58.943 --> 01:12:00.278
We're not gonna move
through it together

1355
01:12:00.278 --> 01:12:01.613
because you're leaving.

1356
01:12:02.822 --> 01:12:04.199
And it seems like
you wanna leave too

1357
01:12:04.199 --> 01:12:06.284
since all we do lately is argue.

1358
01:12:06.284 --> 01:12:07.994
I'm trying here.

1359
01:12:07.994 --> 01:12:10.205
But maybe you just don't
know how to be a partner.

1360
01:12:10.205 --> 01:12:11.289
Heidi.

1361
01:12:11.289 --> 01:12:12.957
I'm sorry.

1362
01:12:12.957 --> 01:12:16.169
But. well. you always wanna
prove how you don't need anyone.

1363
01:12:16.169 --> 01:12:18.546
you can do everything
on your own.

1364
01:12:19.881 --> 01:12:20.757
Maybe you should.

1365
01:12:22.342 --> 01:12:23.968
What's that supposed to mean?

1366
01:12:23.968 --> 01:12:26.554
It means that I don't
wanna lose you as a sister.

1367
01:12:27.722 --> 01:12:30.100
so maybe I need to
lose you as a partner.

1368
01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.477
'Cause it seems like you
would rather run the farm

1369
01:12:32.477 --> 01:12:36.147
on your own. so do it.

1370
01:12:38.024 --> 01:12:39.234
Buy me out.

1371
01:12:51.996 --> 01:12:53.164
- Hi.
- Hey.

1372
01:12:53.164 --> 01:12:54.040
Just checking out.

1373
01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.709
Oh. sure.

1374
01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:58.753
Oh. yeah. actually. your
father left this for you.

1375
01:13:00.755 --> 01:13:01.589
Thanks.

1376
01:13:32.328 --> 01:13:35.123
"I replaced the batteries.

1377
01:13:35.123 --> 01:13:36.082
Dad."

1378
01:13:47.927 --> 01:13:52.057
All your maple recipes.
just how you like them.

1379
01:13:52.057 --> 01:13:54.934
Maybe next year we could do
the Feast of the Seven Fishes

1380
01:13:54.934 --> 01:13:56.019
in Tuscany.

1381
01:13:56.019 --> 01:13:56.936
Yes.

1382
01:13:59.481 --> 01:14:02.942
Erica. can you
come here a sec.

1383
01:14:09.324 --> 01:14:10.700
Andres?

1384
01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:13.119
The Davenport's
withdrew their offer.

1385
01:14:13.119 --> 01:14:14.621
The property's all yours.

1386
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:19.292
Oh. um. well. you
see. about that. um-

1387
01:14:19.292 --> 01:14:20.752
Thank you so much. Andres.

1388
01:14:20.752 --> 01:14:23.213
Erica is excited
to move forward.

1389
01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:26.132
- What?
- Just um. let her know

1390
01:14:26.132 --> 01:14:27.759
next steps.

1391
01:14:27.759 --> 01:14:29.219
I'll email the documents
over after Christmas

1392
01:14:29.219 --> 01:14:30.553
- Okay.
- And Merry Christmas.

1393
01:14:30.553 --> 01:14:31.721
You too.

1394
01:14:35.767 --> 01:14:37.852
Heidi. I'm not
gonna buy the land.

1395
01:14:38.895 --> 01:14:39.771
You were right.

1396
01:14:40.689 --> 01:14:42.649
I can't do everything alone.

1397
01:14:44.109 --> 01:14:48.780
You have Margot and Ollie
and you can hire more staff.

1398
01:14:49.864 --> 01:14:51.658
I don't want more
staff. I want a partner.

1399
01:14:52.784 --> 01:14:56.204
I want a best friend.
I want my sister.

1400
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.127
I don't wanna do
this without you.

1401
01:15:03.211 --> 01:15:04.587
And not just because I need you.

1402
01:15:04.587 --> 01:15:06.214
but because there is no
joy in it without you.

1403
01:15:07.298 --> 01:15:08.675
I know I've let you down.

1404
01:15:08.675 --> 01:15:11.011
but I am begging you to
give me another chance.

1405
01:15:11.011 --> 01:15:12.929
I. I will be better.

1406
01:15:14.347 --> 01:15:17.350
It's not just you
Erica. it's half me.

1407
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:19.769
I've been so defensive

1408
01:15:19.769 --> 01:15:23.565
and I get jealous of
you and Mom sometimes

1409
01:15:23.565 --> 01:15:27.694
because it just seems
like you both belong here

1410
01:15:27.694 --> 01:15:31.489
more than I do. like
you're both made for this

1411
01:15:31.489 --> 01:15:34.284
and maybe I'm not.

1412
01:15:35.493 --> 01:15:37.537
That is not true.

1413
01:15:37.537 --> 01:15:39.414
I know it'll be a
lot of hard work.

1414
01:15:39.414 --> 01:15:41.708
but I don't wanna give up on us.

1415
01:15:41.708 --> 01:15:43.710
I want us to be partners.

1416
01:15:45.503 --> 01:15:46.880
Good.

1417
01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.756
Me too.

1418
01:15:54.262 --> 01:15:56.723
That's good. because I
can't afford to buy you out.

1419
01:15:56.723 --> 01:15:59.351
Then I
guess we're doing this.

1420
01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.020
I don't wanna buy the land

1421
01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:03.772
if you think it's an
emotional decision.

1422
01:16:03.772 --> 01:16:05.940
I think it's an
emotional decision.

1423
01:16:07.359 --> 01:16:09.361
but that doesn't mean I don't
think it's the right one.

1424
01:16:21.539 --> 01:16:23.917
You okay honey?

1425
01:16:23.917 --> 01:16:25.543
Yeah.

1426
01:16:25.543 --> 01:16:26.670
Yeah. I'm okay.

1427
01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:29.589
And I will be okay without you.

1428
01:16:29.589 --> 01:16:32.217
Oh. I know you will.

1429
01:16:33.802 --> 01:16:35.887
I'm sorry I wasn't
happier for you about Leo.

1430
01:16:37.097 --> 01:16:38.098
I am happy.

1431
01:16:39.307 --> 01:16:42.143
I guess I just felt like
you were abandoning me

1432
01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:46.648
and I think I always saw
you as a strong single woman

1433
01:16:46.648 --> 01:16:48.316
who was happy to be alone

1434
01:16:48.316 --> 01:16:52.278
and that made it okay for
me to be that way too.

1435
01:16:52.278 --> 01:16:53.154
It is okay.

1436
01:16:54.197 --> 01:16:55.240
And you're not alone.

1437
01:16:57.033 --> 01:16:59.327
Um. speaking of...

1438
01:17:00.704 --> 01:17:02.122
What happened with Aaron?

1439
01:17:03.498 --> 01:17:04.416
I messed up.

1440
01:17:06.001 --> 01:17:08.294
Maybe it would've worked or
maybe it never would've worked

1441
01:17:08.294 --> 01:17:13.049
and he'd have gotten bored
or left or broken my heart.

1442
01:17:13.925 --> 01:17:15.510
Well. none of that happened.

1443
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:17.345
And you still have
a broken heart.

1444
01:17:18.263 --> 01:17:19.639
I know it's scary.

1445
01:17:19.639 --> 01:17:20.724
I know.

1446
01:17:22.767 --> 01:17:24.519
I'm terrified.

1447
01:17:34.029 --> 01:17:35.989
Hi. you've reached
Aaron. leave a message.

1448
01:17:36.823 --> 01:17:38.158
Hi.

1449
01:17:38.158 --> 01:17:39.075
It's me.

1450
01:17:40.702 --> 01:17:42.704
Listen. I know you probably
don't wanna hear from me.

1451
01:17:42.704 --> 01:17:47.208
I just wanna say
you're not a tourist.

1452
01:17:48.752 --> 01:17:50.879
And I. I should have
said this earlier.

1453
01:17:50.879 --> 01:17:54.966
but I feel the same way you do.

1454
01:17:56.259 --> 01:17:57.093
I feel

1455
01:17:59.095 --> 01:18:00.805
found.

1456
01:18:00.805 --> 01:18:03.016
and I know that you might
be an emotional decision.

1457
01:18:03.016 --> 01:18:08.229
but um. I also know that you
would be the best decision.

1458
01:18:09.606 --> 01:18:11.358
So I guess what I'm.
I'm trying to say is.

1459
01:18:13.526 --> 01:18:15.945
do you wanna come for dinner?

1460
01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.407
And I realize that was a
really long way of saying that.

1461
01:18:19.407 --> 01:18:22.994
so yeah. um.

1462
01:18:24.412 --> 01:18:25.246
that's it.

1463
01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:27.874
Bye.

1464
01:18:49.437 --> 01:18:50.355
Yeah.

1465
01:18:51.439 --> 01:18:52.273
Who's hungry?

1466
01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:55.902
Sorry. can we just
wait one more minute?

1467
01:19:07.122 --> 01:19:07.997
Hi.

1468
01:19:08.957 --> 01:19:09.791
Hi.

1469
01:19:11.251 --> 01:19:13.753
Well. no one's ever been
quite so disappointed to see me.

1470
01:19:13.753 --> 01:19:15.422
No. I'm. I'm sorry.

1471
01:19:15.422 --> 01:19:16.297
I just...

1472
01:19:17.298 --> 01:19:18.258
Come in. please.

1473
01:19:21.636 --> 01:19:22.887
Everyone. this is Steve.

1474
01:19:22.887 --> 01:19:24.472
- Hey.
- Welcome. Steve.

1475
01:19:24.472 --> 01:19:25.390
- Hi.
- Steve.

1476
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:26.516
I invited him.

1477
01:19:26.516 --> 01:19:28.059
I told him Aaron might be here.

1478
01:19:28.059 --> 01:19:28.977
He's not?

1479
01:19:29.853 --> 01:19:31.896
No. please stay anyway.

1480
01:19:33.815 --> 01:19:35.608
Thank you for
withdrawing your offer.

1481
01:19:35.608 --> 01:19:37.944
Well. it meant a lot to Aaron.

1482
01:19:37.944 --> 01:19:39.612
Come on in. Steve.

1483
01:19:39.612 --> 01:19:40.989
This is my younger
daughter. Heidi.

1484
01:19:40.989 --> 01:19:42.198
Hi. nice to meet you.

1485
01:19:42.198 --> 01:19:43.324
Trevor.

1486
01:19:43.324 --> 01:19:44.826
Ciao. I'm Leo.

1487
01:19:46.953 --> 01:19:49.456
- Okay.
- Be happy to. yeah.

1488
01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:51.791
Let's eat.

1489
01:19:51.791 --> 01:19:53.418
You wanna say thanks?

1490
01:19:53.418 --> 01:19:54.836
- Yes.
- Okay.

1491
01:19:58.131 --> 01:20:03.053
Thank you for this food.
for this family. this land.

1492
01:20:03.053 --> 01:20:05.388
this work and this life.

1493
01:20:05.388 --> 01:20:08.683
Thank you for all the things
that have come before us

1494
01:20:08.683 --> 01:20:11.102
and all the things yet to come.

1495
01:20:11.102 --> 01:20:14.481
And thank you for the
things we can't change

1496
01:20:14.481 --> 01:20:17.233
and all the things we can.

1497
01:20:17.233 --> 01:20:18.234
Yeah.

1498
01:20:18.234 --> 01:20:21.029
Merry Christmas.

1499
01:20:37.837 --> 01:20:39.381
You called.

1500
01:20:42.967 --> 01:20:44.052
You're late.

1501
01:20:47.389 --> 01:20:51.893
Maybe I got lost or
maybe I'm right on time.

1502
01:20:53.103 --> 01:20:55.689
And you just weren't
ready for me before.

1503
01:20:58.358 --> 01:21:01.945
Erica. Aaron. dinner.

1504
01:21:21.256 --> 01:21:22.298
