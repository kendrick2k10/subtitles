Damn Keisha!

1456
00:45:11.766 --> 00:45:13.627
Did I give you my key?

1457
00:45:13.627 --> 00:45:15.698
- No. why did you have
your door locked anyway?

1458
00:45:15.698 --> 00:45:18.143
- People can't see that's confidential.

1459
00:45:18.143 --> 00:45:19.698
It's only for the best.

1460
00:45:19.698 --> 00:45:21.532
Damn I gotta go back to

00:57:27.352 --> 00:57:28.185
like the weather was right.

1761
00:57:28.185 --> 00:57:30.055
but the season was wrong.

1762
00:57:30.055 --> 00:57:33.219
No matter what I couldn't
seem to do right in her eyes.

1763
00:57:33.219 --> 00:57:34.550
Or mine.

1764
00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:37.253

1765
00:57:37.253 --> 00:57:38.177

00:57:43.897 --> 00:57:45.202
I gotta stay back?
- Stay back. yeah.

00:57:45.202 --> 00:57:46.035
You know how you played me.

1771
00:57:46.035 --> 00:57:47.715
- You know I can't stay away from that.

1772
00:57:47.715 --> 00:57:48.548
You all right?

1773
00:57:48.548 --> 00:57:49.381
How you been?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

1774
00:57:49.381 --> 00:57:51.261

1775
00:57:51.261 --> 00:57:52.644
- Don't start bringing up old shit.

1776
00:57:52.644 --> 00:57:54.914

1777
00:57:54.914 --> 00:57:55.747
- Listen. listen.

1778
00:57:55.747 --> 00:57:56.947
I had to go out of
town. get my mind right.

1779
00:57:56.947 --> 00:57:58.996
To get my bag right.

1780
00:57:58.996 --> 00:58:00.097
I just wanna take you out.

1781
00:58:00.097 --> 00:58:01.865
I just want a second chance.
You're acting like you don't
believe in second chances.

1782
00:58:01.865 --> 00:58:03.549
- You think you're finna play me again.

1783
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:04.648

- Why should I?

1791
00:58:14.445 --> 00:58:16.649
- I just think that you should
give me a second chance.

1792
00:58:16.649 --> 00:58:17.744
I can't stop thinking about you.

1793
00:58:17.744 --> 00:58:18.597
I was trying to call you.

00:58:40.004 --> 00:58:41.450
- Um. I don't know.

1812
00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:43.432
- You can just figure that shit out.

1813
00:58:43.432 --> 00:58:44.522

1814
00:58:44.522 --> 00:58:45.355

- All right.

1821
00:58:55.742 --> 00:58:56.614
- Look like you want a hug.

1822
00:58:56.614 --> 00:58:58.599
You want a hug?

1823
00:58:58.599 --> 00:58:59.536
- What!

1824
00:58:59.536 --> 00:59:02.523
Now you're pushing it. do not play.

1825
00:59:02.523 --> 00:59:03.879
Or there will not be a second time.

1826

You can keep everybody
