00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:40.092
PACIFICTION

4
00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:20.622
Fix the lines and go ashore.

5
00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.429
- Is that mine?
- Beer?

6
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.163
So it's not for me. Just put it down.

7
00:04:32.298 --> 00:04:34.349
See this pink cocktail umbrella?

8
00:04:34.433 --> 00:04:36.830
I don't see the point in them.

9
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:43.405
We have a problem here?

10
00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:46.231
No. I'm gonna check over there.

11
00:05:03.832 --> 00:05:06.618
- Good evening. monsieur.
- How are you?

12
00:05:07.364 --> 00:05:08.575
Mr. De Roller.

13
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.408
- Admiral.
- Glad to see you here.

14
00:05:10.492 --> 00:05:12.139
The pleasure's mine.

15
00:05:12.223 --> 00:05:16.325
A rare pleasure to have you here.

16
00:05:16.492 --> 00:05:18.895
I see you already have a drink.

17
00:05:19.075 --> 00:05:20.582
Have you yet...

18
00:05:21.867 --> 00:05:25.033
You know. some women here

19
00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:30.160
have visited one of your submarines.

20
00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:32.199
- Oh. yeah?
- "Your" submarines...

21
00:05:32.283 --> 00:05:34.354
- I didn't know.
- Apparently.

22
00:05:35.908 --> 00:05:38.867
You know. happiness knows no limits.

23
00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:45.096
Glad you're so light-hearted. Admiral.

24
00:05:45.183 --> 00:05:47.074
- Great.
- I try to stay this way.

25
00:05:47.158 --> 00:05:49.492
As you should. No matter what.

26
00:05:52.283 --> 00:05:54.066
Will he be here soon?

27
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.003
Sure. In five minutes.

28
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.700
He just left.

29
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.001
- For sure?
- Yes.

30
00:06:02.158 --> 00:06:04.527
Your business isn't well oiled.

31
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.867
Yes it is.

32
00:09:07.507 --> 00:09:08.658
Hello.

33
00:09:13.742 --> 00:09:15.616
- You seen this costume?
- Superb.

34
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.033
Some shells up here...

35
00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:19.789
Looks great.

36
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.100
- Want to try it on?
- Maybe another time.

37
00:09:23.283 --> 00:09:26.183
- Just for the hell of it.
- Well. alright.

38
00:09:28.325 --> 00:09:30.116
- Like this?
- You know <i>le mana</i>?

39
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.786
- Sure!
- Well. this sure has it.

40
00:09:37.742 --> 00:09:39.171
Superb. huh?

41
00:09:40.158 --> 00:09:42.117
No. not that.

42
00:09:46.626 --> 00:09:48.120
How about the necklace?

43
00:09:48.204 --> 00:09:51.178
No. thanks. But it's great.

44
00:09:52.033 --> 00:09:54.116
A Tahitian dancer. maybe.

45
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.090
Yeah. maybe.

46
00:09:57.117 --> 00:09:59.296
Really beautiful.

47
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.426
Very well made.

48
00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:03.213
You give it a whirl.

49
00:10:03.742 --> 00:10:05.422
This is how it looks.

50
00:10:05.742 --> 00:10:07.283
Magnificent.

51
00:10:07.575 --> 00:10:09.741
- It suits you better.
- It does?

52
00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:11.616
- Oh. yeah.
- It suited you. too.

53
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.818
I'll have to get in shape.

54
00:10:14.658 --> 00:10:17.951
Come with us. We'll get you in shape.

55
00:10:19.379 --> 00:10:21.614
I won't bother you any longer.

56
00:10:23.117 --> 00:10:25.117
Very nice.

57
00:10:25.867 --> 00:10:28.224
Well. I won't bug you any longer.

58
00:10:31.742 --> 00:10:33.408
- Hello.
- You alright?

59
00:10:33.492 --> 00:10:35.592
Want to see the costumes?

60
00:10:35.695 --> 00:10:38.408
Thanks. but no. I have to work.

61
00:10:38.492 --> 00:10:41.075
I just like to enjoy this ambiance.

62
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.991
I wanted you to see how
the rooster costume is.

63
00:10:44.075 --> 00:10:45.575
Right. right.

64
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.624
We're doing a rehearsal of...

65
00:10:47.708 --> 00:10:49.134
I'll watch from a distance.

66
00:10:49.218 --> 00:10:50.658
I don't want to intrude.

67
00:10:50.742 --> 00:10:52.989
It's very charming. Thanks.

68
00:10:53.073 --> 00:10:54.501
See you again!

69
00:11:11.242 --> 00:11:13.715
There are rumors from Fangataufa.

70
00:11:13.862 --> 00:11:16.325
an island near Moruroa.

71
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.283
where nuclear testing took place...

72
00:11:19.367 --> 00:11:23.934
- Of course.
- In the past.

73
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.450
So. it's been said...

74
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.950
There are apparently projects

75
00:11:36.242 --> 00:11:41.824
to restructure the Nuclear
Experiment Center.

76
00:11:42.325 --> 00:11:47.310
and potentially resume nuclear testing

77
00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:48.915
this year.

78
00:11:50.492 --> 00:11:54.078
So we wanted to hear
what your views are.

79
00:11:55.492 --> 00:11:58.418
Have you heard of this?

80
00:11:58.617 --> 00:11:59.908
Listen.

81
00:12:01.742 --> 00:12:04.658
I must admit I'm totally surprised.

82
00:12:04.854 --> 00:12:06.813
It surprised us. too.

83
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.596
"Grandpa. what did you do

84
00:12:55.684 --> 00:12:58.895
to defend my land and my ocean?

85
00:12:59.325 --> 00:13:01.731
Grandpa. every day when I get up.

86
00:13:01.844 --> 00:13:04.710
I go to school on this land.

87
00:13:05.041 --> 00:13:06.650
After school.

88
00:13:06.734 --> 00:13:09.017
I go and swim in the ocean. Grandpa!

89
00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:11.841
What did you do to protect me?"

90
00:13:15.408 --> 00:13:16.991
Of course. of course.

91
00:13:17.075 --> 00:13:20.169
Evidently. we must be vigilant

92
00:13:20.349 --> 00:13:22.366
- and act...
- That's why we're here.

93
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.437
...preemptively

94
00:13:24.617 --> 00:13:27.983
to prevent a resumption of the tests.

95
00:13:29.325 --> 00:13:30.880
I believe what you're saying.

96
00:13:30.964 --> 00:13:32.835
but I must reassure you.

97
00:13:34.158 --> 00:13:40.876
Do you realize the costs
such tests would incur

98
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:47.212
after all the tragedies they caused?

99
00:13:49.033 --> 00:13:51.104
We're counting on you.
High Commissioner.

100
00:13:51.188 --> 00:13:53.759
I entirely understand your concerns.

101
00:13:53.908 --> 00:13:55.595
If you could shed light upon this...

102
00:13:55.679 --> 00:13:58.750
I'll do my best.

103
00:13:59.492 --> 00:14:01.015
Thanks. Pierre-Olivier.

104
00:14:01.099 --> 00:14:02.472
Excuse me.

105
00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:05.447
- Enjoy your meal!
- Thanks.

106
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:07.138
Would you like some coffee?

107
00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:10.500
No. thanks. we've had enough.

108
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.033
- Forgive me.
- No worries.

109
00:14:23.742 --> 00:14:27.473
The meal on this
plate is from our lagoon.

110
00:14:27.557 --> 00:14:29.469
But of course.

111
00:14:29.658 --> 00:14:34.768
It allows you to live.
to breathe. to move.

112
00:14:36.617 --> 00:14:39.430
I was expecting to see Jacques.

113
00:14:39.617 --> 00:14:41.200
Jacques is sick.

114
00:14:41.284 --> 00:14:43.500
- I see.
- Jacques is sick. so...

115
00:14:43.584 --> 00:14:46.385
- I'm representing him today.
- Great.

116
00:14:47.075 --> 00:14:53.128
I'm kind of an interim representative.

117
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.408
Is he alright?

118
00:14:55.533 --> 00:14:57.676
- He's fine.
- Nothing serious?

119
00:14:57.815 --> 00:15:01.542
Nothing serious. A case of the flu.

120
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.944
So you'll be taking over?

121
00:15:04.113 --> 00:15:06.975
Exactly. I'll be taking over...

122
00:15:08.117 --> 00:15:11.964
and hope to see you at future meetings.

123
00:15:13.783 --> 00:15:15.270
Absolutely.

124
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.109
We wanted to discuss another thing:

125
00:15:18.283 --> 00:15:20.969
Our people won't be granted admission

126
00:15:21.173 --> 00:15:22.853
to the planned casino.

127
00:15:24.617 --> 00:15:28.325
We're a bit surprised
by this segregation.

128
00:15:29.992 --> 00:15:32.306
You know how

129
00:15:32.492 --> 00:15:35.408
the religious institutions here

130
00:15:36.867 --> 00:15:39.982
have enormous power

131
00:15:40.158 --> 00:15:42.312
in decision-making.

132
00:15:42.492 --> 00:15:44.742
They're rather coercive.

133
00:15:45.992 --> 00:15:50.378
After all. people need to have fun.

134
00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.662
Yes. after all. we're an island.

135
00:15:52.746 --> 00:15:55.485
The most exciting thing to do here

136
00:15:55.658 --> 00:15:57.998
is walk around in circles.

137
00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.193
So don't be surprised if young people

138
00:16:02.367 --> 00:16:03.926
get into mischief.

139
00:16:04.113 --> 00:16:06.542
I have to admit. they piss me off.

140
00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.283
Enough already.

141
00:16:09.908 --> 00:16:14.220
Why are they interfering?
This is a new century.

142
00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:17.785
If they don't want their parishioners

143
00:16:17.992 --> 00:16:19.533
being admitted...

144
00:16:19.742 --> 00:16:22.046
- Why not?
- Then fair enough.

145
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.766
Fair enough.

146
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.390
But it's unthinkable to forbid

147
00:16:26.596 --> 00:16:29.453
the island's population from having fun.

148
00:16:30.943 --> 00:16:32.896
You'd think this is the Inquisition.

149
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.507
It's not the Middle Ages.

150
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.780
Although I can tell you in confidence.

151
00:16:39.992 --> 00:16:43.176
I don't know many
people who win at casinos.

152
00:16:43.367 --> 00:16:47.062
- It's the casino that wins.
- It always does.

153
00:16:47.242 --> 00:16:49.616
- But people have fun there.
- Exactly.

154
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.175
Frankly. the religious types

155
00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:52.908
are a pain in the ass.

156
00:16:52.992 --> 00:16:54.386
They can't bust our balls

157
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.116
from the other end of the world.

158
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.325
No kidding.

159
00:16:57.489 --> 00:17:00.366
- If you'll excuse my language.
- We agree.

160
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.075
- Pardon me. madam.
- Not at all.

161
00:17:04.332 --> 00:17:07.392
It's true. We've had it with them.

162
00:17:07.575 --> 00:17:10.082
The Jehovah's Witnesses.

163
00:17:10.283 --> 00:17:12.777
I'm sick of them. really.

164
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.574
We didn't have the French
Revolution for nothing.

165
00:17:15.658 --> 00:17:17.801
- Well. I mean us...
- Exactly.

166
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.783
So for me. these are resolved issues.

167
00:17:23.867 --> 00:17:25.533
- No question.
- Good to hear.

168
00:17:25.617 --> 00:17:27.159
You'll have my support.

169
00:17:27.243 --> 00:17:30.075
The casino will be open to all.

170
00:17:31.367 --> 00:17:34.153
And we'll celebrate Bastille Day there!

171
00:17:34.575 --> 00:17:36.932
- A national holiday.
- Fantastic.

172
00:17:38.367 --> 00:17:41.224
With a free first
chip for all residents.

173
00:17:42.533 --> 00:17:45.706
- Just to piss them off.
- That's what we want.

174
00:17:48.117 --> 00:17:50.974
And we'll all go to Morton's afterwards.

175
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.792
Those who want to.

176
00:17:52.876 --> 00:17:54.586
I don't know if we'll all fit.

177
00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.658
It's a bit cramped.

178
00:17:59.325 --> 00:18:01.955
Mark it on your calendars.

179
00:18:02.158 --> 00:18:04.288
Seriously. It's a promise.

180
00:18:04.502 --> 00:18:05.905
July 14th.

181
00:18:06.058 --> 00:18:07.865
We'll go to the casino

182
00:18:08.051 --> 00:18:10.390
to celebrate the values of the Republic.

183
00:18:10.474 --> 00:18:12.658
Then to Morton's. Fantastic.

184
00:18:13.768 --> 00:18:15.768
Thanks.

185
00:18:16.867 --> 00:18:18.547
Will you show them out?

186
00:18:19.242 --> 00:18:20.556
Bye. Mr. De Roller.

187
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.426
- Thanks for your time.
- Gladly. madam.

188
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.996
I'd like to remain cool

189
00:18:45.121 --> 00:18:47.955
and wait for things to work out.

190
00:18:51.455 --> 00:18:53.954
My documents were here.

191
00:18:54.121 --> 00:18:55.621
I never left with them.

192
00:18:55.705 --> 00:18:57.913
They never left the room.

193
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.829
They've clearly been stolen.

194
00:18:59.913 --> 00:19:02.205
They were stolen from the hotel

195
00:19:02.496 --> 00:19:04.079
by hotel employees.

196
00:19:04.163 --> 00:19:06.329
Stay calm. We'll call the police.

197
00:19:06.413 --> 00:19:09.384
No police. They'll complicate things.

198
00:19:09.538 --> 00:19:12.890
This only has to do with this hotel.

199
00:19:13.121 --> 00:19:15.920
But I don't have the time to wait.

200
00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:17.788
It's urgent.

201
00:19:19.496 --> 00:19:22.955
I have various reasons to be here.

202
00:19:23.138 --> 00:19:25.496
and those reasons

203
00:19:27.205 --> 00:19:30.378
oblige me to always have

204
00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:33.330
my passport and my documents.

205
00:19:33.496 --> 00:19:37.163
That's why I'd prefer to remain calm

206
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.205
and confer about this

207
00:19:40.455 --> 00:19:41.830
but we must find a solution.

208
00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:44.955
I need my passport and documents.

209
00:20:01.996 --> 00:20:04.246
- You OK. Tico.
- Fine. fine.

210
00:20:15.705 --> 00:20:17.848
- Shall I pour?
- If you would.

211
00:20:25.205 --> 00:20:26.537
- There.
- Thank you.

212
00:20:26.621 --> 00:20:27.858
- Sir?
- Yes.

213
00:20:28.038 --> 00:20:30.969
There's a man claiming he's Portuguese.

214
00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:32.877
He's completely distraught.

215
00:20:32.961 --> 00:20:35.532
He says his papers have been stolen.

216
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.133
- At the hotel?
- Yes.

217
00:20:38.746 --> 00:20:40.080
How peculiar.

218
00:20:40.788 --> 00:20:42.038
And when?

219
00:20:42.955 --> 00:20:44.414
This morning.

220
00:20:44.621 --> 00:20:47.264
He mentioned a "diplomatic passport."

221
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:50.621
- Was he alone or with someone?
- Alone.

222
00:20:51.496 --> 00:20:53.538
What's that about?

223
00:20:54.621 --> 00:20:56.009
Unbelievable.

224
00:20:56.205 --> 00:20:58.079
- His passport was stolen?
- Yes.

225
00:20:58.163 --> 00:21:00.505
He hasn't seen anyone since he arrived.

226
00:21:00.589 --> 00:21:02.413
so it's weird.

227
00:21:03.288 --> 00:21:06.534
That kind of thing never happens here.

228
00:21:06.746 --> 00:21:09.637
Has anyone been in his room?

229
00:21:09.871 --> 00:21:11.330
No one.

230
00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:13.681
Maybe he's just claiming that.

231
00:21:14.663 --> 00:21:17.234
- And he sounds mad.
- He sounds mad?

232
00:21:19.996 --> 00:21:22.788
Mad how? Nervous? Angry?

233
00:21:24.288 --> 00:21:25.663
A little. yes.

234
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.401
Is he thinking clearly or...?

235
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.115
More or less.

236
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.912
Should we call security?

237
00:21:32.996 --> 00:21:34.880
We'd normally call the police.

238
00:21:34.964 --> 00:21:37.604
but he kept repeating...

239
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.510
He seems to know you.

240
00:21:41.121 --> 00:21:44.455
- So he's a diplomat?
- I don't really get it.

241
00:21:44.705 --> 00:21:48.788
He'd prefer not to deal with the police.

242
00:21:53.746 --> 00:21:55.426
- How peculiar.
- Yes.

243
00:21:56.663 --> 00:21:59.246
He must be involved in something shady.

244
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.621
You think so?

245
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:06.830
Well. well. well.

246
00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.830
Do it with your hand like this.

247
00:23:25.371 --> 00:23:26.914
I didn't get that.

248
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.694
When you see me. do this.

249
00:23:29.871 --> 00:23:32.705
He'll come from here. I'll pull you...

250
00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:36.747
Stab it.

251
00:23:36.955 --> 00:23:38.746
- Like that?
- Yeah.

252
00:23:46.788 --> 00:23:49.787
Do you know what you'll
be doing on the islands?

253
00:23:49.871 --> 00:23:52.121
Do you know where they plan to...

254
00:23:52.205 --> 00:23:55.540
For the moment.
I've been assigned to Fakarava.

255
00:23:55.705 --> 00:24:00.158
So I'm going there. then to Takume.

256
00:24:00.371 --> 00:24:04.663
These are the locations
the army wants to visit.

257
00:24:05.708 --> 00:24:08.871
I imagine there are other islands. too.

258
00:24:08.989 --> 00:24:11.170
But they're initially
occupying those two?

259
00:24:11.254 --> 00:24:12.253
For now.

260
00:24:12.371 --> 00:24:13.840
I'll go there next week

261
00:24:13.924 --> 00:24:17.542
to deposit the sound and lighting cases.

262
00:24:17.705 --> 00:24:20.121
And will it be operational soon?

263
00:24:20.656 --> 00:24:22.423
I'm leaving next week

264
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.663
and it'll take a week
to install all that.

265
00:24:26.371 --> 00:24:31.080
- That's quick.
- Yes. The strip is short.

266
00:24:31.663 --> 00:24:34.329
- When did they contact you?
- A month back.

267
00:24:34.413 --> 00:24:35.580
That's quick.

268
00:24:35.705 --> 00:24:39.830
They made the proposal
and stated conditions.

269
00:24:40.913 --> 00:24:43.270
I read the contract and liked it.

270
00:24:43.746 --> 00:24:46.621
- I was interested.
- Right. I get it.

271
00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:51.496
It's always good to
have a friend in the army.

272
00:24:53.205 --> 00:24:56.785
I'm lucky to have you.
This is a good start.

273
00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:58.496
That's good.

274
00:25:19.871 --> 00:25:22.228
What scares you about the casino?

275
00:25:22.871 --> 00:25:25.784
You think people will have fun there

276
00:25:25.978 --> 00:25:27.764
and come here less often?

277
00:25:29.538 --> 00:25:33.580
This is about the mass.
the little ceremonies...

278
00:25:34.371 --> 00:25:36.330
Those little amusements.

279
00:25:38.496 --> 00:25:39.812
People work all week

280
00:25:39.896 --> 00:25:42.537
and come on Sunday to
amuse themselves with you.

281
00:25:42.621 --> 00:25:45.121
We're offering them an alternative.

282
00:25:45.455 --> 00:25:48.490
Let them at least have
the freedom to decide.

283
00:25:50.038 --> 00:25:51.324
Let's be clear.

284
00:25:52.163 --> 00:25:55.129
What I can tell you
is the casino will open.

285
00:25:55.955 --> 00:25:58.669
And it will be taxed like all casinos.

286
00:25:58.871 --> 00:26:01.788
And the tax money will come to me.

287
00:26:03.246 --> 00:26:04.705
And that money

288
00:26:06.121 --> 00:26:09.288
I'll use to destroy your
chapels if I have to.

289
00:26:10.455 --> 00:26:12.812
It won't take long. I assure you.

290
00:26:17.205 --> 00:26:19.131
This would make a nice festival hall.

291
00:26:19.215 --> 00:26:21.038
We could fix it up.

292
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.434
offer pottery workshops.

293
00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.121
organize bingo.

294
00:26:27.955 --> 00:26:30.913
and offer the senior citizens fun. too.

295
00:26:32.788 --> 00:26:35.288
Your flock has shrunk. hasn't it?

296
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.037
Did you say anything to calm him down?

297
00:26:56.121 --> 00:26:59.538
I just had to listen to him talk it out.

298
00:27:02.663 --> 00:27:04.621
Was he angry at first?

299
00:27:05.246 --> 00:27:06.996
- Surprised?
- Yes.

300
00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:09.205
More surprised than angry.

301
00:27:13.188 --> 00:27:14.937
Are you sure he didn't say anything

302
00:27:15.021 --> 00:27:16.787
that might help me assist him?

303
00:27:16.871 --> 00:27:18.186
No. sir.

304
00:27:20.538 --> 00:27:22.233
Nothing at all.

305
00:27:23.871 --> 00:27:25.912
Can't you help me a bit more?

306
00:27:25.996 --> 00:27:27.788
Just something about...

307
00:27:31.746 --> 00:27:33.291
Actually. no.

308
00:27:33.455 --> 00:27:35.830
I don't think we'll go that far.

309
00:27:37.996 --> 00:27:39.934
We'll send him to you once he's here.

310
00:27:40.018 --> 00:27:42.871
You're being very coy about this.

311
00:27:43.121 --> 00:27:45.550
Don't worry. it's nothing serious.

312
00:27:54.871 --> 00:27:56.830
I'm not worried. Shannah.

313
00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:02.139
I have other ways to find out.

314
00:28:04.205 --> 00:28:05.663
I don't doubt it.

315
00:28:08.163 --> 00:28:09.871
Can I get your details?

316
00:28:13.371 --> 00:28:15.082
Write them down.

317
00:28:15.288 --> 00:28:18.392
- Did I misspell your name?
- An N is missing.

318
00:28:18.955 --> 00:28:22.726
- What a delightful ring. I love it.
- Thanks.

319
00:28:22.913 --> 00:28:25.721
- A beautiful color.
- Thanks.

320
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:29.038
So. last name and...

321
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.330
- First name.
- Right.

322
00:28:33.038 --> 00:28:35.201
You don't want my address?

323
00:28:35.371 --> 00:28:36.871
Why not?

324
00:28:38.663 --> 00:28:40.371
You want to visit me?

325
00:28:40.496 --> 00:28:42.455
If you like. why not?

326
00:28:54.413 --> 00:28:56.913
You really have nothing to tell me?

327
00:28:57.871 --> 00:29:00.413
A detail that occurred to you?

328
00:29:01.538 --> 00:29:02.996
Well. sir.

329
00:29:04.371 --> 00:29:06.927
- we could work it out.
- Very good.

330
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.760
- I'll call you.
- Ok.

331
00:29:10.413 --> 00:29:12.270
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

332
00:29:18.871 --> 00:29:20.834
- Weird.
- Yes.

333
00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:28.996
Morton?

334
00:29:37.663 --> 00:29:40.306
Mr. Ferreira. are you feeling better?

335
00:29:51.121 --> 00:29:52.955
He's knocked out.

336
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.417
Did he drink too much?

337
00:29:54.501 --> 00:29:56.204
That's what we were wondering.

338
00:29:56.288 --> 00:29:58.454
- There's that bottle.
- Indeed.

339
00:29:58.538 --> 00:30:00.080
It's half empty.

340
00:30:03.955 --> 00:30:06.306
Another glass of tequila. sir?

341
00:30:08.955 --> 00:30:11.598
- A little glass?
- I'll grab him one.

342
00:30:18.121 --> 00:30:19.801
It's rum. what's more.

343
00:30:21.413 --> 00:30:23.413
Let's have a drink with him.

344
00:30:24.871 --> 00:30:26.863
Loïs. got any glasses?

345
00:30:31.246 --> 00:30:32.288
Listen.

346
00:30:33.455 --> 00:30:35.246
I can call the police.

347
00:30:36.705 --> 00:30:37.905
File a report.

348
00:30:38.069 --> 00:30:40.371
Should we give his passport back?

349
00:30:40.455 --> 00:30:41.871
No. not now.

350
00:30:46.371 --> 00:30:49.663
He's a good-for-nothing. He's useless.

351
00:30:53.246 --> 00:30:54.913
Don't worry.

352
00:30:58.455 --> 00:31:00.022
He'll recover.

353
00:31:00.246 --> 00:31:03.626
We'll give him oxygen to
get him back on his feet.

354
00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.474
Did you ask him about the Admiral?

355
00:31:09.705 --> 00:31:10.913
About what?

356
00:31:12.538 --> 00:31:14.663
- About the fleet.
- Oh. no.

357
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.038
No?

358
00:31:16.163 --> 00:31:19.020
- You didn't have the time?
- Not at all.

359
00:31:19.205 --> 00:31:21.754
We didn't get to that.

360
00:31:21.955 --> 00:31:23.778
He just got upset about his passport?

361
00:31:23.862 --> 00:31:27.538
Yes. we were wondering why.

362
00:31:28.246 --> 00:31:31.419
That's the only thing
we could've used him for.

363
00:31:33.955 --> 00:31:37.871
He needs to be seen by a doctor.

364
00:31:38.121 --> 00:31:40.050
We can't stay here all day.

365
00:31:41.121 --> 00:31:42.413
Look at him.

366
00:31:48.163 --> 00:31:49.806
I hear he's been hanging out in bars

367
00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:51.348
with the Admiral.

368
00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.955
That's possible.

369
00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.259
They've been seen together.

370
00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.487
I don't know what he knows.

371
00:32:00.705 --> 00:32:02.697
He must know something.

372
00:32:02.877 --> 00:32:05.287
Have a good time with the Admiral?

373
00:32:05.371 --> 00:32:07.054
He's not very talkative with me.

374
00:32:07.138 --> 00:32:10.121
but he chats a bit more with you. right?

375
00:32:11.538 --> 00:32:13.681
I hear you two get along well.

376
00:32:18.663 --> 00:32:19.871
Have a drink.

377
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:29.373
It'll do you good.

378
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.788
He's on his way.

379
00:32:34.538 --> 00:32:35.746
Have a sip.

380
00:32:38.913 --> 00:32:41.246
Very good. Just a bit.

381
00:32:48.663 --> 00:32:50.580
Another sip. Another.

382
00:32:54.288 --> 00:32:55.413
Taste good?

383
00:32:56.538 --> 00:32:58.580
Reminds you of last night?

384
00:32:59.413 --> 00:33:01.371
Another sip will do you good.

385
00:33:01.455 --> 00:33:03.871
Go on. go on. one last one.

386
00:33:09.246 --> 00:33:12.032
Your friend. the Admiral. just arrived!

387
00:33:13.538 --> 00:33:15.609
Were you with him last night?

388
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:19.081
Look. here he is.

389
00:33:19.288 --> 00:33:21.221
Say hello to your friend.

390
00:33:21.413 --> 00:33:23.556
- Say hello.
- Hello. Ferreira.

391
00:33:24.413 --> 00:33:26.770
Talk to your friend. the Admiral.

392
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.901
What do you want to tell him?

393
00:33:33.205 --> 00:33:36.171
Do you remember what
you told him yesterday?

394
00:33:40.746 --> 00:33:43.955
Have a drink. It'll do you good.

395
00:33:46.121 --> 00:33:47.705
Is he alright?

396
00:33:50.205 --> 00:33:53.205
- He's better?
- He's coming around.

397
00:33:56.371 --> 00:33:58.085
The nurse is on her way.

398
00:33:58.996 --> 00:34:00.717
She'll be right here.

399
00:34:00.919 --> 00:34:03.419
I called her ten minutes ago.

400
00:34:03.663 --> 00:34:06.017
She'll be here within minutes.

401
00:34:06.205 --> 00:34:07.205
Great.

402
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.723
Could you bring us a bottle of water?

403
00:34:13.038 --> 00:34:14.801
A cold one.

404
00:34:14.996 --> 00:34:16.595
It'll do him good.

405
00:34:17.371 --> 00:34:20.621
- Water?
- Nothing but water for him.

406
00:34:28.121 --> 00:34:30.839
Mr. Ferreira. have some water.

407
00:34:30.996 --> 00:34:34.496
Drink some water.
it'll do you a ton of good.

408
00:34:35.288 --> 00:34:36.831
You're dehydrated.

409
00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.080
Slowly. not too fast.

410
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.288
I heard him screaming.

411
00:34:46.413 --> 00:34:47.371
No.

412
00:34:47.455 --> 00:34:51.496
He just got scared.
He's not thinking clearly.

413
00:34:52.705 --> 00:34:54.288
He's confused.

414
00:34:57.455 --> 00:34:59.884
I think he has a drinking problem.

415
00:35:01.996 --> 00:35:04.246
Neither of us can do anything.

416
00:35:05.038 --> 00:35:08.121
He must be badly dehydrated.

417
00:35:09.288 --> 00:35:10.917
They'll take him...

418
00:35:12.163 --> 00:35:14.830
to the hospital. worst case.

419
00:35:14.949 --> 00:35:17.520
But with some rest. he should be OK.

420
00:35:17.621 --> 00:35:19.496
He's better already.

421
00:35:21.205 --> 00:35:24.913
Morton was already talking to him.

422
00:35:27.913 --> 00:35:30.484
Morton. you'll remain at his bedside

423
00:35:31.246 --> 00:35:33.371
while we wait for the nurse.

424
00:35:33.996 --> 00:35:35.694
So you can go back now.

425
00:35:35.847 --> 00:35:38.217
To my dancers?

426
00:35:38.371 --> 00:35:41.413
- Precisely.
- Otherwise. call me if needed.

427
00:35:41.955 --> 00:35:43.580
No worries.

428
00:35:44.121 --> 00:35:47.225
We've got this.
Thank you for your assistance.

429
00:35:52.663 --> 00:35:55.306
Keep her away so I can talk a little.

430
00:36:50.347 --> 00:36:53.247
The staff could put on more clothes.
right?

431
00:36:53.681 --> 00:36:58.389
Listen. it's what Morton's is known for.

432
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:04.257
It's what makes other
nightclubs jealous.

433
00:37:05.097 --> 00:37:07.526
You all deserve better. don't you?

434
00:37:08.472 --> 00:37:10.847
I can't speak to that.

435
00:37:12.806 --> 00:37:16.889
It's Morton who takes
the initiative and decides.

436
00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:21.996
And everyone admires Morton here?

437
00:37:22.514 --> 00:37:25.365
Well. let's just say...

438
00:37:26.264 --> 00:37:28.787
it's crowded every weekend.

439
00:37:31.228 --> 00:37:34.431
I see that as a form of admiration.

440
00:37:36.806 --> 00:37:40.642
You came to find inspiration?

441
00:37:41.639 --> 00:37:45.220
No. I came at the
invitation of Mr. De Roller.

442
00:37:46.514 --> 00:37:48.889
It allows me to promote my books.

443
00:37:49.514 --> 00:37:51.347
And chat about my work.

444
00:37:52.222 --> 00:37:54.160
That's nice.

445
00:37:54.347 --> 00:37:58.139
- And maybe inspiration...
- Will come.

446
00:37:58.306 --> 00:38:01.382
...will come or manifest itself later.

447
00:38:01.889 --> 00:38:03.569
I don't know. but...

448
00:38:03.722 --> 00:38:07.847
And you write about what. in general?

449
00:38:07.972 --> 00:38:12.181
I write about my life
or imaginary things.

450
00:38:13.264 --> 00:38:14.847
So it varies.

451
00:38:15.764 --> 00:38:18.056
A writer should really

452
00:38:18.181 --> 00:38:20.472
- dabble in everything.
- I agree.

453
00:38:20.556 --> 00:38:22.847
Even poetry or theater.

454
00:38:24.722 --> 00:38:26.139
Awesome.

455
00:38:27.222 --> 00:38:29.097
Have you published a lot?

456
00:38:30.389 --> 00:38:31.889
Quite a bit.

457
00:38:35.181 --> 00:38:36.847
The requested file.

458
00:38:36.972 --> 00:38:39.681
But couldn't this wait until morning?

459
00:38:40.806 --> 00:38:42.877
Where do you want me to sign?

460
00:38:43.639 --> 00:38:44.889
It's true.

461
00:38:46.847 --> 00:38:48.847
I wasn't born yet.

462
00:38:53.389 --> 00:38:57.264
Do you see Mr. De Roller's secretary?

463
00:38:57.972 --> 00:39:00.097
- What a bitch.
- Who's that?

464
00:39:00.306 --> 00:39:02.806
Mareva. Right there.

465
00:39:04.014 --> 00:39:05.889
Why do you say that?

466
00:39:06.056 --> 00:39:08.264
Because she's weird.

467
00:39:10.472 --> 00:39:15.465
I heard he's gonna get rid of her.

468
00:39:15.639 --> 00:39:17.347
Really? Why?

469
00:39:17.508 --> 00:39:20.889
Apparently. she works for other people.

470
00:39:21.931 --> 00:39:25.916
And he caught her...

471
00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:28.139
She doesn't seem to know.

472
00:39:28.264 --> 00:39:30.006
Who's she working for?

473
00:39:30.222 --> 00:39:32.680
People you wouldn't want to know.
I guess.

474
00:39:32.764 --> 00:39:33.972
I see.

475
00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:37.782
I heard he's going to get rid of her.

476
00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:42.654
I'd really love to take her place.

477
00:39:42.847 --> 00:39:45.561
- Oh. yeah?
- Yes. It'd be interesting.

478
00:39:45.764 --> 00:39:49.006
- He must be wonderful to work with.
- Oh. yeah.

479
00:39:49.889 --> 00:39:52.306
I think I'd really enjoy it.

480
00:40:01.472 --> 00:40:03.801
Lieliski. varam s? kt.
Great. we can begin.

481
00:40:03.885 --> 00:40:06.222
To your health above all.

482
00:40:06.389 --> 00:40:09.181
- Cheers.
- I've completely recovered.

483
00:40:09.472 --> 00:40:11.222
Loïs.

484
00:40:16.056 --> 00:40:18.127
Is he a friend of yours. too?

485
00:40:18.306 --> 00:40:22.389
Loïs works with the owner.

486
00:40:35.097 --> 00:40:38.683
I was shown around a hotel last week

487
00:40:39.563 --> 00:40:43.401
that was built on an old <i>morai.</i>

488
00:40:43.931 --> 00:40:45.809
a sacred cemetery.

489
00:40:46.931 --> 00:40:48.546
That usually causes trouble.

490
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.638
The hotel is still abandoned.

491
00:40:50.722 --> 00:40:52.056
Sure.

492
00:40:53.347 --> 00:40:54.431
So?

493
00:40:56.222 --> 00:40:58.184
They're looking for an investor.

494
00:40:58.268 --> 00:40:59.847
someone to put money in.

495
00:40:59.931 --> 00:41:01.222
Of course.

496
00:41:01.431 --> 00:41:04.820
- To rebuild it.
- You're interested?

497
00:41:05.181 --> 00:41:07.490
- You work...
- I don't work.

498
00:41:07.595 --> 00:41:09.452
- Oh. you don't work.
- No.

499
00:41:12.972 --> 00:41:15.276
That would be a big investment.

500
00:41:15.681 --> 00:41:18.253
You've inherited a lot.

501
00:41:18.931 --> 00:41:20.404
It's colossal.

502
00:41:20.584 --> 00:41:22.450
One never works alone on such projects.

503
00:41:22.534 --> 00:41:23.771
Of course not.

504
00:41:23.857 --> 00:41:27.056
You know.
people with money help each other.

505
00:41:27.306 --> 00:41:31.257
You must know a lot of interested people

506
00:41:31.431 --> 00:41:34.656
who'll support you in this idea.

507
00:41:35.306 --> 00:41:37.056
Will you be one of them?

508
00:41:37.221 --> 00:41:40.648
I'll be someone you can
count on if you need help.

509
00:41:40.806 --> 00:41:42.866
I think it's imperative

510
00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:45.825
that this hotel rise up from the ashes.

511
00:41:46.972 --> 00:41:49.329
Letting things rot is never good.

512
00:41:49.806 --> 00:41:51.398
I try to be proactive.

513
00:41:51.482 --> 00:41:52.773
Once you've got a project.

514
00:41:52.857 --> 00:41:56.169
you have to avoid getting bogged down.

515
00:41:56.972 --> 00:41:58.309
You're a man of action.

516
00:41:58.393 --> 00:42:01.357
I love action. Indeed.

517
00:42:03.222 --> 00:42:05.682
So if I can help in the little time

518
00:42:05.766 --> 00:42:09.014
I have on the island. I'll do so.

519
00:42:09.223 --> 00:42:11.222
Are you about to leave?

520
00:42:12.056 --> 00:42:14.828
No. but you know. my mission...

521
00:42:15.014 --> 00:42:16.388
Are you well. Shannah?

522
00:42:16.472 --> 00:42:19.372
- I am.
- Sorry. I didn't notice you there.

523
00:42:19.514 --> 00:42:21.057
- You good?
- I am.

524
00:42:22.014 --> 00:42:24.295
- You look enchanting.
- Thanks.

525
00:42:26.597 --> 00:42:28.482
Shannah. this is Olivier.

526
00:42:29.889 --> 00:42:31.432
A friend of Cyrus.

527
00:42:33.097 --> 00:42:35.340
I don't remember where we were.

528
00:42:36.931 --> 00:42:39.847
- I'm glad you came tonight.
- Same here.

529
00:42:39.972 --> 00:42:41.722
Did Morton invite you?

530
00:42:42.389 --> 00:42:44.960
I don't need his invitation to come.

531
00:42:48.431 --> 00:42:49.806
I invite myself.

532
00:42:50.889 --> 00:42:52.569
I don't need anyone.

533
00:42:53.389 --> 00:42:56.847
I utilize my privilege maybe too often.

534
00:42:58.715 --> 00:43:01.608
I just make sure everything's OK.

535
00:43:01.801 --> 00:43:03.354
People know me.

536
00:43:03.561 --> 00:43:08.899
They know I'm very
involved with everyone.

537
00:43:10.097 --> 00:43:12.891
I'm pretty proud.

538
00:43:13.639 --> 00:43:16.605
They've proven their
trust in me many times.

539
00:43:16.764 --> 00:43:18.181
Which is nice.

540
00:43:18.722 --> 00:43:21.764
He does have an easy
manner with the locals.

541
00:43:22.472 --> 00:43:25.056
And the locals reciprocate it.

542
00:43:28.431 --> 00:43:31.931
You know. it's all a matter of trust.

543
00:43:45.139 --> 00:43:47.430
What will you do later. De Roller?

544
00:43:47.514 --> 00:43:49.681
Meaning what? Later when?

545
00:43:51.431 --> 00:43:53.097
Later this evening.

546
00:43:54.764 --> 00:43:57.621
I don't know. I'll see where the wind...

547
00:43:58.222 --> 00:44:00.456
I'll go where the wind blows.

548
00:44:01.222 --> 00:44:04.894
- Where the wind takes you.
- That's right.

549
00:44:05.514 --> 00:44:08.371
But I must admit
I'm a bit tired tonight.

550
00:44:15.056 --> 00:44:16.139
He's here.

551
00:44:17.139 --> 00:44:18.339
Great. thanks.

552
00:44:28.597 --> 00:44:29.597
So...

553
00:44:30.139 --> 00:44:31.722
do you take drugs?

554
00:44:32.806 --> 00:44:34.764
- Yes.
- I see.

555
00:44:36.347 --> 00:44:38.931
- And you?
- Occasionally.

556
00:44:39.163 --> 00:44:40.764
But...

557
00:44:43.181 --> 00:44:44.954
it's not all that great.

558
00:44:45.514 --> 00:44:47.438
It's a bit like coffee.

559
00:44:48.972 --> 00:44:52.076
Not exactly.
It doesn't have the same effects.

560
00:44:52.806 --> 00:44:54.435
At least not on me.

561
00:44:58.014 --> 00:45:00.514
Obviously never when I'm at sea.

562
00:45:01.431 --> 00:45:03.060
as you can imagine.

563
00:45:03.764 --> 00:45:06.550
- It's different when I'm ashore.
- Yes.

564
00:45:07.639 --> 00:45:12.068
Then you want to feel
like you're back at sea.

565
00:45:12.186 --> 00:45:14.951
- Right?
- You understand me very well.

566
00:45:15.181 --> 00:45:18.056
I mean. it makes me more balanced.

567
00:45:21.181 --> 00:45:24.038
I won't lie.
I find it hard being ashore.

568
00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:25.971
Really.

569
00:45:26.097 --> 00:45:27.920
You're better off at sea.

570
00:45:28.106 --> 00:45:29.786
Better in the sea. yes.

571
00:45:30.514 --> 00:45:33.912
It reassures me.
There's great solidarity

572
00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:36.389
between people.

573
00:45:37.181 --> 00:45:40.505
between human beings. between men.

574
00:45:40.764 --> 00:45:42.181
Ashore...

575
00:45:42.757 --> 00:45:44.590
I feel more shaky.

576
00:45:44.787 --> 00:45:46.779
That's how it is.

577
00:45:46.931 --> 00:45:50.389
I could mention the Polynesians.
or others.

578
00:45:50.514 --> 00:45:55.181
who also wound up exterminated.

579
00:45:55.306 --> 00:45:57.139
Genocides have created...

580
00:45:58.181 --> 00:45:59.666
The Indian genocide has created...

581
00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:01.263
...great civilizations.

582
00:46:01.347 --> 00:46:02.465
Great civilizations.

583
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:03.909
It was good born of evil.

584
00:46:03.993 --> 00:46:06.016
as people cynically say.

585
00:46:06.681 --> 00:46:09.197
The most terrible thing I've heard

586
00:46:09.347 --> 00:46:10.998
was someone explaining

587
00:46:11.082 --> 00:46:14.877
that even if nuclear fission had created

588
00:46:15.064 --> 00:46:17.982
illnesses. thyroid cancers.

589
00:46:18.162 --> 00:46:21.842
birth defects and other horrors

590
00:46:22.347 --> 00:46:24.710
lasting over generations.

591
00:46:24.835 --> 00:46:26.747
the nuclear program
also afforded us the money

592
00:46:26.831 --> 00:46:28.222
to treat them.

593
00:46:29.806 --> 00:46:32.847
When you hear these conversations...

594
00:46:38.181 --> 00:46:40.681
I don't think you follow me.

595
00:46:49.222 --> 00:46:50.902
Is that a new waiter?

596
00:46:51.681 --> 00:46:53.361
I've never seen him.

597
00:46:54.806 --> 00:46:58.017
A lost sheep. He's handsome.

598
00:47:19.014 --> 00:47:23.513
It's an important civic duty -

599
00:47:23.597 --> 00:47:25.777
to be here in support...

600
00:47:25.887 --> 00:47:28.244
of a spirit as free as Ms. Attia.

601
00:47:32.847 --> 00:47:36.157
For several years.
she has waged a relentless war

602
00:47:38.264 --> 00:47:40.097
against obscurantism.

603
00:47:41.764 --> 00:47:44.731
political correctness. puritanism.

604
00:47:44.889 --> 00:47:46.877
the self-righteous.

605
00:47:47.056 --> 00:47:48.599
the useful idiots.

606
00:47:53.972 --> 00:47:55.274
Her enlightened spirit

607
00:47:55.358 --> 00:47:58.215
reminds me of those of the 18th century.

608
00:47:59.597 --> 00:48:02.168
It's an immensely cultivated spirit.

609
00:48:07.299 --> 00:48:09.621
It reminds me of the libertines.
among others.

610
00:48:09.705 --> 00:48:12.276
As much for her intellectual courage

611
00:48:12.372 --> 00:48:13.592
as for the care

612
00:48:13.676 --> 00:48:16.119
she takes in realizing her pleasures.

613
00:48:20.972 --> 00:48:22.516
I write. too.

614
00:48:22.702 --> 00:48:26.055
Wait.
I won't claim to be a writer myself.

615
00:48:26.252 --> 00:48:29.298
I write. you all know that.
you often see me

616
00:48:29.514 --> 00:48:31.014
with a notebook.

617
00:48:31.764 --> 00:48:34.954
It allows me to structure my ideas.

618
00:48:35.139 --> 00:48:36.914
to have less disorder.

619
00:48:37.056 --> 00:48:39.542
to be more precise with my projects

620
00:48:39.626 --> 00:48:41.769
and put things in perspective.

621
00:48:43.847 --> 00:48:45.527
That was a little anecdote.

622
00:48:45.611 --> 00:48:48.511
Sorry.
I'm obviously talking about myself.

623
00:48:48.764 --> 00:48:49.972
I digress!

624
00:48:51.181 --> 00:48:52.431
I digress.

625
00:48:53.389 --> 00:48:55.597
But I can recognize real writers.

626
00:48:55.681 --> 00:48:59.097
Those who can create a
kind of foreign language.

627
00:49:00.972 --> 00:49:02.672
who provoke confusion

628
00:49:02.865 --> 00:49:05.969
rather than offering
simplified clarification.

629
00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:08.181
Romane is one of them.

630
00:49:11.472 --> 00:49:13.128
One might have thought

631
00:49:13.212 --> 00:49:16.055
she was a Parisian bourgeois

632
00:49:17.681 --> 00:49:19.487
whose work is plagued

633
00:49:19.571 --> 00:49:21.712
by the work of introspection.

634
00:49:25.472 --> 00:49:26.722
But no.

635
00:49:29.222 --> 00:49:32.264
She manages to show the dirty. obscene.

636
00:49:32.444 --> 00:49:36.229
ideological side of
that milieu from within.

637
00:49:44.931 --> 00:49:47.574
A free spirit. enlightened as I said.

638
00:49:56.014 --> 00:49:57.643
What's not to like?

639
00:49:58.139 --> 00:49:59.222
Indeed.

640
00:49:59.931 --> 00:50:02.402
- Bravo. Romane.
- Thanks.

641
00:50:13.639 --> 00:50:14.368
Matahi.

642
00:50:14.452 --> 00:50:16.356
have you introduced
the Admiral to Romane?

643
00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.456
I didn't dare.

644
00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:20.182
I was waiting for you to do it.
Commissioner.

645
00:50:20.266 --> 00:50:22.556
Well then. if I may...

646
00:50:23.806 --> 00:50:27.373
Admiral!
May I introduce you to Romane Attia?

647
00:50:27.514 --> 00:50:28.847
Please do.

648
00:50:32.681 --> 00:50:35.181
- Should I get up or not?
- No need.

649
00:50:36.306 --> 00:50:39.686
- Admiral. it's a pleasure.
- Pleased to meet you.

650
00:50:40.764 --> 00:50:42.472
Introduce yourselves.

651
00:50:50.681 --> 00:50:53.597
I hope we'll have the chance to talk.

652
00:50:53.759 --> 00:50:56.014
I hope so. too.

653
00:50:56.972 --> 00:50:58.425
And that I'll have the pleasure

654
00:50:58.509 --> 00:51:00.432
of reading your next work.

655
00:51:00.597 --> 00:51:03.311
- Please do.
- It's highly recommended.

656
00:51:03.681 --> 00:51:06.538
Mr. De Roller has
just praised it highly.

657
00:51:07.514 --> 00:51:10.824
so I imagine it will live
up to our expectations.

658
00:51:44.722 --> 00:51:46.681
- I stayed here.
- Nice job.

659
00:51:57.097 --> 00:51:58.722
To act is to act.

660
00:52:00.556 --> 00:52:03.514
I believe in the virtues of action.

661
00:52:04.014 --> 00:52:06.389
One must send out clear signals.

662
00:52:08.847 --> 00:52:09.972
Strong ones.

663
00:52:11.097 --> 00:52:12.597
Conspicuous ones.

664
00:52:13.931 --> 00:52:15.181
Conspicuous.

665
00:52:20.389 --> 00:52:21.535
When they see

666
00:52:21.685 --> 00:52:25.235
what we're willing to
do to our own people.

667
00:52:25.431 --> 00:52:27.014
yes. our own.

668
00:52:31.139 --> 00:52:33.980
will they still be able to doubt

669
00:52:34.139 --> 00:52:36.425
how our enemies will be treated?

670
00:52:46.472 --> 00:52:49.347
Will you announce all this publicly?

671
00:52:49.472 --> 00:52:52.618
Will you and your
government have the courage?

672
00:52:52.806 --> 00:52:55.520
- Of course.
- That'll take some balls.

673
00:52:56.806 --> 00:52:59.347
Not just doing it all on the sly.

674
00:52:59.556 --> 00:53:00.876
Some balls!

675
00:53:05.222 --> 00:53:07.308
Of course we'll announce it.

676
00:53:07.889 --> 00:53:10.014
Are you prepared for the repercussions?

677
00:53:10.098 --> 00:53:13.159
We'll announce it to great fanfare!

678
00:53:15.764 --> 00:53:17.307
We'll stand by it!

679
00:53:18.097 --> 00:53:19.514
I will!

680
00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:30.097
So tell me.

681
00:53:31.139 --> 00:53:34.097
what would you do with all the enemies?

682
00:53:35.764 --> 00:53:36.663
My friend...

683
00:53:36.747 --> 00:53:38.972
What would you do with the terrorists?

684
00:53:39.056 --> 00:53:42.830
With the various types of terrorism?

685
00:53:43.014 --> 00:53:45.228
Do you have enemies. my friend?

686
00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:48.038
Is the alcohol making you paranoid?

687
00:53:48.122 --> 00:53:50.336
We all have enemies. all of us.

688
00:53:50.556 --> 00:53:53.127
In Polynesia. we don't have enemies.

689
00:53:53.806 --> 00:53:56.389
Close by: the Philippines.

690
00:53:59.514 --> 00:54:01.056
Indonesia.

691
00:54:01.264 --> 00:54:03.639
That's the extent of the threats.

692
00:54:05.597 --> 00:54:06.931
Look.

693
00:54:09.014 --> 00:54:10.431
I'll try to...

694
00:54:13.597 --> 00:54:14.931
Here.

695
00:54:15.764 --> 00:54:17.097
I'm standing.

696
00:54:18.514 --> 00:54:19.514
See?

697
00:54:21.097 --> 00:54:22.514
Not very well.

698
00:54:22.806 --> 00:54:24.556
I'm standing.

699
00:54:27.056 --> 00:54:28.764
- A bit unsteady.
- No.

700
00:54:30.014 --> 00:54:31.139
Yup.

701
00:55:08.597 --> 00:55:10.917
Careful. Admiral. You alright?

702
00:55:16.514 --> 00:55:19.389
It's OK. take it easy. Give me that.

703
00:55:32.264 --> 00:55:33.721
Alright. Admiral.

704
00:55:34.639 --> 00:55:36.850
Could we have a little talk?

705
00:55:53.556 --> 00:55:55.138
Where are we going?

706
00:55:55.222 --> 00:55:58.079
We could extend the evening if you like.

707
00:55:58.347 --> 00:56:00.097
Let's do it.

708
00:56:01.472 --> 00:56:02.889
See you later.

709
00:56:22.722 --> 00:56:24.889
- To Paradise. sir?
- No.

710
00:57:04.774 --> 00:57:06.108
That's scary.

711
00:57:07.524 --> 00:57:09.524
There's lots of debris. too.

712
00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:35.233
- My God!
- Look at that!

713
00:57:35.358 --> 00:57:36.566
Terrifying.

714
00:58:17.941 --> 00:58:19.798
Hold tight. Mr. De Roller.

715
00:58:21.899 --> 00:58:23.399
Where's our champion?

716
00:58:23.483 --> 00:58:24.899
- The young guy?
- Yes.

717
00:58:24.983 --> 00:58:26.274
He'll be here.

718
00:58:27.691 --> 00:58:29.017
His towing team

719
00:58:29.184 --> 00:58:31.107
is taking someone out to the waves.

720
00:58:31.191 --> 00:58:33.024
Then it'll be his turn.

721
00:58:43.983 --> 00:58:47.233
- Can I take a ride on a jet ski?
- Absolutely.

722
00:58:48.066 --> 00:58:49.149
Thierry!

723
00:58:57.774 --> 00:58:58.803
You're good.

724
00:59:00.691 --> 00:59:02.148
Take care of him.

725
00:59:05.316 --> 00:59:07.024
This is the High Commissioner.

726
00:59:07.108 --> 00:59:09.218
High Commissioner.
this is Heirarii Williams.

727
00:59:09.302 --> 00:59:11.545
one of the great surfers here.

728
00:59:12.899 --> 00:59:14.756
This is our young prodigy.

729
00:59:16.274 --> 00:59:18.203
I've heard a lot about you.

730
00:59:18.858 --> 00:59:21.667
If there's any way I can help you.

731
00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.274
just let me know.

732
00:59:23.358 --> 00:59:25.751
Sure. I'll call you if I need you.

733
00:59:25.835 --> 00:59:27.260
Do that.

734
00:59:27.483 --> 00:59:29.107
It'll be my pleasure.

735
00:59:29.191 --> 00:59:31.199
It's a competition.

736
00:59:31.399 --> 00:59:33.294
I compete in a different realm.

737
00:59:33.378 --> 00:59:35.812
Are you in the competition?

738
00:59:35.983 --> 00:59:38.149
I compete in politics.

739
01:00:51.941 --> 01:00:53.899
- Incredible.
- An adrenaline rush. huh?

740
01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:56.566
Yes. Sensational. Transforming.

741
01:00:57.691 --> 01:01:00.876
Not much happens in my job.

742
01:01:01.066 --> 01:01:02.444
Well. this is my office

743
01:01:02.528 --> 01:01:04.957
and it's always trying to kill me.

744
01:01:08.858 --> 01:01:11.358
It's good to get out of the office.

745
01:01:17.316 --> 01:01:19.149
And the kid is brilliant.

746
01:01:20.233 --> 01:01:21.892
I'll try to help him.

747
01:01:21.976 --> 01:01:23.656
He has a good attitude.

748
01:01:23.779 --> 01:01:27.121
Keep your eye on him.
You won't be disappointed.

749
01:02:07.858 --> 01:02:09.149
OK. let's go.

750
01:02:44.024 --> 01:02:45.751
Don't worry. we'll get through.

751
01:02:45.835 --> 01:02:47.621
Yeah. they're incredible.

752
01:02:53.483 --> 01:02:54.774
What swells!

753
01:02:56.441 --> 01:02:59.341
I haven't seen
anything like it for years.

754
01:04:33.358 --> 01:04:34.524
Come in.

755
01:04:36.524 --> 01:04:39.149
De Roller. a friend of the cause.

756
01:04:40.524 --> 01:04:42.524
Make yourselves comfortable.

757
01:04:44.524 --> 01:04:46.358
What a charming place.

758
01:04:49.024 --> 01:04:50.566
I'll get drinks.

759
01:04:50.774 --> 01:04:54.084
I didn't know you live
in such a beautiful place.

760
01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:58.594
- There's a lot you don't know.
- It's a beautiful house.

761
01:04:59.274 --> 01:05:00.731
A beautiful <i>faré</i>.

762
01:05:02.149 --> 01:05:04.078
A beautiful thatched house.

763
01:05:07.816 --> 01:05:09.530
I was expecting Jacques.

764
01:05:10.399 --> 01:05:13.014
Jacques is gone. forget Jacques.

765
01:05:13.233 --> 01:05:15.081
I'm your partner now.

766
01:05:15.566 --> 01:05:16.732
- That's it.
- Ok.

767
01:05:16.816 --> 01:05:18.232
Young. fresh blood.

768
01:05:18.316 --> 01:05:19.733
Are we good?

769
01:05:21.316 --> 01:05:22.399
Suits me.

770
01:05:26.691 --> 01:05:29.357
The first rally in the
streets is in a few days.

771
01:05:29.441 --> 01:05:30.927
Don't be afraid.

772
01:05:31.108 --> 01:05:34.691
We're kind of organizing the movement.

773
01:05:38.108 --> 01:05:39.663
We wanted to check with you

774
01:05:39.747 --> 01:05:41.185
what the response will be.

775
01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:43.269
If it's controllable or not.

776
01:05:47.733 --> 01:05:50.127
But you're aware

777
01:05:50.316 --> 01:05:52.245
that these are only rumors.

778
01:05:53.191 --> 01:05:56.858
I don't have any solid information.

779
01:05:57.816 --> 01:05:59.941
I don't have any hard facts.

780
01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:04.422
Listen. It doesn't
matter what you think

781
01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:07.233
or what information you have access to.

782
01:06:08.149 --> 01:06:11.204
The first rallies are this week.

783
01:06:11.399 --> 01:06:15.024
We're not going to wait
around for a confirmation.

784
01:06:17.108 --> 01:06:18.774
No. We're taking action.

785
01:06:18.858 --> 01:06:22.150
We're not going back to '95.

786
01:06:22.316 --> 01:06:27.191
or to the '70s when we
just let them carry on.

787
01:06:27.774 --> 01:06:29.601
If we do.
we'll end up with them conducting

788
01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:32.585
nuclear tests in our home.
Enough of that.

789
01:06:33.691 --> 01:06:36.564
You're not here to give us your opinion.

790
01:06:36.724 --> 01:06:39.581
We don't give a shit about your opinion.

791
01:06:40.191 --> 01:06:42.233
We're here to ask you

792
01:06:43.649 --> 01:06:45.358
to act how we want:

793
01:06:45.691 --> 01:06:47.441
prophylactically.

794
01:06:49.024 --> 01:06:51.780
There will be deaths. perhaps. Injuries.

795
01:06:51.864 --> 01:06:53.544
We're aware of that.

796
01:06:54.149 --> 01:06:57.733
But we're asking you to
tone down the reaction.

797
01:06:59.566 --> 01:07:01.789
In that case.

798
01:07:01.941 --> 01:07:04.930
your employer will be satisfied with you

799
01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:07.273
because you did your job well.

800
01:07:07.733 --> 01:07:09.816
And equally. the locals

801
01:07:10.608 --> 01:07:13.899
won't be unleashed against you.

802
01:07:14.816 --> 01:07:17.173
So you can play both sides a bit.

803
01:07:19.108 --> 01:07:22.143
You'll have to finesse it.
but it's possible.

804
01:07:25.233 --> 01:07:28.190
We'll have our photographs
and that's all we want:

805
01:07:28.274 --> 01:07:30.761
buzz. fake news.

806
01:07:30.941 --> 01:07:33.012
That's what our era is about.

807
01:07:37.024 --> 01:07:38.831
Simple as that.

808
01:07:39.024 --> 01:07:41.649
That's the problem with young people.

809
01:07:41.733 --> 01:07:43.328
Don't be condescending. my friend.

810
01:07:43.412 --> 01:07:45.341
I didn't condescend to you.

811
01:07:45.481 --> 01:07:47.624
I'm not talking as your equal.

812
01:07:48.316 --> 01:07:49.625
You were born yesterday.

813
01:07:49.709 --> 01:07:51.107
You're wet behind the ears.

814
01:07:51.191 --> 01:07:53.691
And you're explaining things to me?

815
01:07:53.983 --> 01:07:55.036
Do you really think

816
01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.549
I don't know what's going on here?

817
01:07:58.691 --> 01:08:00.405
Or who your friends are?

818
01:08:02.024 --> 01:08:04.738
You think I came here knowing nothing?

819
01:08:05.483 --> 01:08:06.516
My friend.

820
01:08:06.689 --> 01:08:08.440
need I remind you this isn't your home?

821
01:08:08.524 --> 01:08:11.815
Quit saying "my friend."
We're not that close.

822
01:08:12.024 --> 01:08:14.566
Back off. I'm not your friend.

823
01:08:15.441 --> 01:08:17.429
"My friend. my friend..."

824
01:08:17.608 --> 01:08:20.850
You're talking to a
representative of the State.

825
01:08:22.816 --> 01:08:24.733
I'm not into shenanigans.

826
01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:27.940
I try to take care of the
people as well as I can.

827
01:08:28.024 --> 01:08:30.006
- Really?
- You're surprised?

828
01:08:30.090 --> 01:08:32.832
Well. the people have something to say.

829
01:08:32.916 --> 01:08:34.307
Right now.

830
01:08:36.191 --> 01:08:38.589
Give me a bit more time.

831
01:08:38.774 --> 01:08:41.631
and I guarantee that
when the time comes.

832
01:08:42.233 --> 01:08:45.483
I'll act together with you accordingly.

833
01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:51.149
I don't think we understand each other.

834
01:08:54.816 --> 01:08:57.774
I didn't come to ask
for your permission.

835
01:08:58.649 --> 01:09:00.649
I came to warn you

836
01:09:01.316 --> 01:09:04.358
that we're taking action
in the coming days.

837
01:09:06.303 --> 01:09:10.519
We're only here to help you. my friend.
You have to understand.

838
01:09:16.316 --> 01:09:18.441
- Fine.
- You talk a lot.

839
01:09:18.608 --> 01:09:20.274
- I talk little.
- And know nothing.

840
01:09:20.358 --> 01:09:22.149
- And act well.
- Yeah?

841
01:09:30.941 --> 01:09:32.024
Matahi.

842
01:09:33.191 --> 01:09:34.316
come here.

843
01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.203
I've known you a long time.

844
01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:42.983
I want you to understand.

845
01:09:44.358 --> 01:09:46.857
There's just one thing that worries me.

846
01:09:46.941 --> 01:09:48.233
just one:

847
01:09:49.566 --> 01:09:51.524
It's that a guy like you

848
01:09:52.649 --> 01:09:55.983
couldn't organize
something like this by himself.

849
01:09:57.358 --> 01:10:02.452
So what I... imagine is that interests.

850
01:10:02.659 --> 01:10:05.577
certainly superior to my own employers.

851
01:10:05.774 --> 01:10:07.816
must have contacted you.

852
01:10:08.024 --> 01:10:10.671
Maybe Russia or China or even

853
01:10:10.858 --> 01:10:12.538
your American friend.

854
01:10:14.733 --> 01:10:16.524
That worries me.

855
01:10:17.858 --> 01:10:20.491
Because if these people

856
01:10:20.671 --> 01:10:23.989
called in someone
like you at this point.

857
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:25.974
maybe I should abandon my career.

858
01:10:26.058 --> 01:10:27.915
because it makes no sense.

859
01:10:29.899 --> 01:10:33.399
Are you trying to give me
lessons on geostrategy?

860
01:10:34.358 --> 01:10:35.927
On the nuclear technology race?

861
01:10:36.011 --> 01:10:37.640
You think I don't know that?

862
01:10:37.724 --> 01:10:39.404
You think I don't know

863
01:10:40.191 --> 01:10:43.816
that China. Russia and America

864
01:10:44.524 --> 01:10:45.962
have no interest at all

865
01:10:46.046 --> 01:10:48.046
in these tests taking place?

866
01:10:49.816 --> 01:10:52.899
So here's what I want you to understand:

867
01:10:54.566 --> 01:10:55.774
I heard you.

868
01:10:57.358 --> 01:10:58.472
you heard me.

869
01:10:58.566 --> 01:11:00.662
I'm not against you.

870
01:11:00.816 --> 01:11:03.440
I know who you are. you know who I am.

871
01:11:03.524 --> 01:11:04.676
I'm not against you.

872
01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.732
I'm not against the people here.

873
01:11:06.816 --> 01:11:09.357
You know. contrary to what you think.

874
01:11:09.441 --> 01:11:12.525
it's not vanity that drives us

875
01:11:12.691 --> 01:11:15.864
the way it drives your people.
your government.

876
01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:20.234
We have convictions.

877
01:11:20.399 --> 01:11:22.079
we have certainties.

878
01:11:23.649 --> 01:11:25.131
The system is different.

879
01:11:25.215 --> 01:11:27.644
the way of operating is different.

880
01:11:27.774 --> 01:11:30.175
- You can laugh. go on.
- I'm not laughing.

881
01:11:30.259 --> 01:11:32.566
I just think you're naive.

882
01:11:34.274 --> 01:11:35.273
Listen.

883
01:11:36.191 --> 01:11:37.905
I think you're a coward.

884
01:11:40.191 --> 01:11:42.258
Think about what I told you.

885
01:11:42.441 --> 01:11:44.298
The ball is in your court.

886
01:11:45.566 --> 01:11:47.301
I have nothing to add.

887
01:11:47.524 --> 01:11:49.233
I'll contact you soon.

888
01:12:02.399 --> 01:12:04.256
We won't get far with him.

889
01:14:12.941 --> 01:14:14.358
Here is good.

890
01:16:51.305 --> 01:16:52.620
Congratulations. it's great.

891
01:16:52.704 --> 01:16:54.418
We're changing it a bit.

892
01:16:54.513 --> 01:16:56.710
It's not aggressive.

893
01:16:56.930 --> 01:17:01.689
A lack of aggression in the faces.
A fierceness.

894
01:17:01.888 --> 01:17:04.353
- Combativeness.
- Yes.

895
01:17:04.555 --> 01:17:08.543
You can see the hens smiling...

896
01:17:08.763 --> 01:17:10.549
It lacks aggression.

897
01:17:10.763 --> 01:17:14.084
- Not warlike enough?
- Yes. It's to the death.

898
01:17:14.347 --> 01:17:16.842
The violence has to be there.

899
01:17:17.055 --> 01:17:21.953
So the criticism is a
slight lack of violence.

900
01:17:22.597 --> 01:17:24.069
We'll change it.

901
01:17:24.216 --> 01:17:26.502
It's a matter of interpretation.

902
01:17:28.045 --> 01:17:30.346
You know. cockfighting is pitiless.

903
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:32.590
- We'll revise it.
- Great.

904
01:17:32.816 --> 01:17:36.847
I have an idea.
Let's do this: You kill...

905
01:17:37.722 --> 01:17:40.555
The hens are smiling. That can't be.

906
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:46.096
It's not violent enough.

907
01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:47.966
- You felt it. too?
- Yes.

908
01:18:39.222 --> 01:18:41.430
There are big and small cocks?

909
01:18:43.055 --> 01:18:45.680
- And chicks.
- Yeah. chicks. too.

910
01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:18.222
That's it.

911
01:19:20.013 --> 01:19:21.930
There it is. the kill.

912
01:19:24.805 --> 01:19:26.948
And the hens finish him off...

913
01:20:09.055 --> 01:20:10.684
Let the blood flow.

914
01:21:11.055 --> 01:21:14.055
Superb! There's sweat. there's blood!

915
01:21:16.055 --> 01:21:18.180
That's the way.

916
01:21:18.305 --> 01:21:21.013
- There are deaths. it's tough.
- How was it?

917
01:21:21.097 --> 01:21:23.745
It's powerful. it's barbaric.

918
01:21:23.930 --> 01:21:25.705
- You liked it?
- Very much.

919
01:21:25.789 --> 01:21:27.462
That's what you wanted?

920
01:21:27.546 --> 01:21:29.889
Yes. the violence was missing.

921
01:21:34.763 --> 01:21:37.120
Bravo. musicians. You were great.

922
01:21:42.305 --> 01:21:45.847
Now we can see it in your faces.

923
01:21:45.972 --> 01:21:47.222
It's great.

924
01:21:48.513 --> 01:21:50.388
Everyone gave their all.

925
01:21:50.513 --> 01:21:52.870
Will we really see the cocks die?

926
01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:57.530
It's beautiful to see such violence.

927
01:21:57.614 --> 01:21:58.790
No holds barred.

928
01:21:58.874 --> 01:22:02.096
No emotions.
no hesitation: You go for the kill.

929
01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:04.239
If he's down. kill him.

930
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:05.805
At once!

931
01:22:48.763 --> 01:22:51.061
- Come aboard. sir.
- Thanks.

932
01:22:51.263 --> 01:22:53.192
- Settle in.
- Thanks a lot.

933
01:22:59.305 --> 01:23:02.162
Don't bang your heads
like everyone else.

934
01:23:03.638 --> 01:23:05.263
It'd be a shame.

935
01:23:05.388 --> 01:23:06.930
Of course.

936
01:24:02.263 --> 01:24:03.943
Look how sublime it is!

937
01:24:05.347 --> 01:24:07.138
You never get used to it!

938
01:24:08.722 --> 01:24:11.222
Every time I fly.

939
01:24:12.305 --> 01:24:13.985
I feel the same way!

940
01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.537
Look how beautiful our island is.

941
01:24:29.305 --> 01:24:31.180
The multitude of colors.

942
01:24:31.513 --> 01:24:33.222
the gradations of blue.

943
01:24:36.555 --> 01:24:37.805
It's divine.

944
01:24:38.805 --> 01:24:41.019
- The cradle of God.
- Of Jesus.

945
01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:46.763
It's great for the soul.

946
01:24:47.555 --> 01:24:50.797
It cleans your mind.
you can think more clearly.

947
01:24:52.763 --> 01:24:54.692
I need to take a step back.

948
01:24:59.388 --> 01:25:01.930
You know. people live with passion.

949
01:25:03.097 --> 01:25:05.026
Everything's about passion.

950
01:25:06.722 --> 01:25:10.137
So naturally. there are emotions.

951
01:25:10.347 --> 01:25:13.736
Too much emotion kills rationality.

952
01:25:13.972 --> 01:25:15.388
You can't reason

953
01:25:16.465 --> 01:25:19.179
if you're too emotional.
It's impossible.

954
01:25:19.263 --> 01:25:22.049
You have to abandon your body entirely.

955
01:25:23.013 --> 01:25:25.299
With enough distance. you can...

956
01:25:26.138 --> 01:25:29.130
make decisions that benefit the many.

957
01:25:29.888 --> 01:25:33.685
And not get caught up emotionally.

958
01:25:33.851 --> 01:25:37.354
Sadly. that's no good on its own.

959
01:25:37.555 --> 01:25:39.769
I'm already breaking that rule.

960
01:25:45.513 --> 01:25:47.193
I'm counting on you.

961
01:27:06.972 --> 01:27:09.138
- We'll land in 20 minutes. sir.
- Sorry?

962
01:27:09.222 --> 01:27:11.388
- 20 minutes.
- Alright.

963
01:27:49.347 --> 01:27:52.133
I think you'll find them very pleasant.

964
01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:55.097
For this kind of work.

965
01:27:56.055 --> 01:27:57.888
they're very efficient.

966
01:27:58.763 --> 01:28:02.138
In addition to being
great friends of mine.

967
01:28:03.597 --> 01:28:06.097
- Thanks. Captain.
- You're welcome.

968
01:28:09.013 --> 01:28:11.910
- Did you enjoy it. Shannah?
- Yes.

969
01:28:12.097 --> 01:28:14.526
- Our "little" trip?
- It was cool.

970
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:16.429
Right.

971
01:28:18.347 --> 01:28:19.472
Alright.

972
01:28:19.597 --> 01:28:21.513
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

973
01:28:21.805 --> 01:28:23.346
- Thanks. Captain.
- My pleasure.

974
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:25.110
- See you later.
- Yes.

975
01:28:36.055 --> 01:28:37.930
- My friend.
- What's up?

976
01:28:41.013 --> 01:28:42.847
Did you have a nice trip?

977
01:28:44.263 --> 01:28:47.430
It was over in an instant. How are you?

978
01:28:47.597 --> 01:28:48.968
Good to see you.

979
01:28:49.055 --> 01:28:51.472
- Same here.
- It's been so long.

980
01:28:53.555 --> 01:28:55.235
- How are you?
- Great.

981
01:28:56.013 --> 01:28:57.222
I'm so glad.

982
01:28:59.763 --> 01:29:01.847
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

983
01:29:03.097 --> 01:29:04.777
So. everything alright?

984
01:29:05.972 --> 01:29:07.388
It's all fine.

985
01:29:09.722 --> 01:29:11.888
My colleague. Mareva.

986
01:29:13.805 --> 01:29:15.748
And Shannah.

987
01:29:15.930 --> 01:29:18.763
who's just come to observe.

988
01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:23.126
I'm delighted things are going well.

989
01:29:23.347 --> 01:29:26.222
Everything's going very well.

990
01:29:27.305 --> 01:29:30.561
We've been working
well for several months.

991
01:29:30.722 --> 01:29:33.915
Then I'm not really needed here. am I?

992
01:29:34.129 --> 01:29:35.929
You don't need my support.

993
01:29:36.013 --> 01:29:38.501
- A bit would be nice.
- Oh yeah?

994
01:29:38.714 --> 01:29:41.463
What counts is that we see the island

995
01:29:41.651 --> 01:29:43.722
and spend some time together.

996
01:29:44.222 --> 01:29:45.347
I'm so happy.

997
01:29:47.013 --> 01:29:49.680
He's our outgoing and future Mayor.

998
01:29:53.222 --> 01:29:54.902
You're bound to win.

999
01:29:55.847 --> 01:29:58.430
Well. I'm the strongest candidate.

1000
01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:01.938
I've worked well with my team here.

1001
01:30:02.022 --> 01:30:04.139
and there you go.

1002
01:30:05.222 --> 01:30:06.972
What do the polls say?

1003
01:30:07.555 --> 01:30:10.707
At the moment. we're at 72%.

1004
01:30:10.888 --> 01:30:14.180
but I hope to reach 80-99%.

1005
01:30:16.888 --> 01:30:19.138
It'll look like a banana republic.

1006
01:30:19.222 --> 01:30:22.138
They'll say these elections are rigged.

1007
01:30:22.888 --> 01:30:24.949
That's just jealousy.

1008
01:30:25.142 --> 01:30:26.767
Only jealous people will say it?

1009
01:30:26.851 --> 01:30:30.180
But let your opponents
win at least some votes.

1010
01:30:30.305 --> 01:30:32.325
I do have opponents. but...

1011
01:30:32.518 --> 01:30:33.846
I'm joking. of course.

1012
01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:36.144
You know how to do things here.

1013
01:30:36.805 --> 01:30:39.840
He was the first person
I met on this island.

1014
01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:42.282
He immediately opened his arms

1015
01:30:42.366 --> 01:30:44.179
and welcomed me into his home.

1016
01:30:44.263 --> 01:30:46.634
He was extremely generous.

1017
01:30:46.805 --> 01:30:49.705
That's what I call a
priceless friendship.

1018
01:30:51.513 --> 01:30:53.814
Are you staying for a few days?

1019
01:30:54.013 --> 01:30:56.638
I'm leaving soon. sadly.

1020
01:30:57.472 --> 01:31:01.388
We'll have lunch and leave again at 5.

1021
01:31:04.138 --> 01:31:05.613
I have a lot to take care of.

1022
01:31:05.697 --> 01:31:08.889
and there are concerning developments.

1023
01:31:09.388 --> 01:31:11.888
- How's that?
- How should I put it?

1024
01:31:14.055 --> 01:31:15.512
There are rumors.

1025
01:31:16.055 --> 01:31:20.013
Rumors I initially disregarded.

1026
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:24.603
- At first. I thought...
- What kind of rumors?

1027
01:31:25.763 --> 01:31:26.930
Listen.

1028
01:31:29.805 --> 01:31:32.180
I refuse to accept it.

1029
01:31:32.347 --> 01:31:35.034
It sounds so crazy.

1030
01:31:35.241 --> 01:31:38.263
but there's talk about
resuming nuclear testing.

1031
01:31:38.347 --> 01:31:41.638
Initially. it was just people

1032
01:31:42.472 --> 01:31:45.222
who heard other people say so.

1033
01:31:45.805 --> 01:31:47.485
I don't believe that.

1034
01:31:47.722 --> 01:31:50.605
- No. That's not good.
- Yes.

1035
01:31:50.805 --> 01:31:54.097
Why can't they just
go to the desert or...

1036
01:31:55.472 --> 01:31:59.734
Maybe I'm paranoid.
but sometimes I think

1037
01:31:59.888 --> 01:32:03.347
it's a grand scheme to weaken me.

1038
01:32:04.972 --> 01:32:08.385
On the other hand.
I'm not that important.

1039
01:32:08.597 --> 01:32:10.785
What decisions do I make? None.

1040
01:32:10.869 --> 01:32:13.056
I simply represent the State.

1041
01:32:13.722 --> 01:32:16.472
Would the tests be aerial or...

1042
01:32:18.763 --> 01:32:23.819
No idea. I have a friend who was told

1043
01:32:24.013 --> 01:32:26.739
to make installations

1044
01:32:26.932 --> 01:32:28.881
and set up lighting on various islands.

1045
01:32:28.965 --> 01:32:31.058
So there is movement.

1046
01:32:33.597 --> 01:32:34.805
Which is new.

1047
01:32:35.972 --> 01:32:39.347
It worries me because
it kind of corroborates...

1048
01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:42.679
Don't worry.

1049
01:32:42.888 --> 01:32:45.100
We'll talk to the fishermen

1050
01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:47.753
and install teams everywhere.

1051
01:32:47.972 --> 01:32:49.628
We'll investigate with our team.

1052
01:32:49.712 --> 01:32:51.847
There are clearly movements.

1053
01:32:52.305 --> 01:32:55.180
Marines suddenly appeared on the island

1054
01:32:55.930 --> 01:32:57.263
just like that.

1055
01:32:57.486 --> 01:32:58.556
They look like

1056
01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.813
they haven't seen the
light of day for a while.

1057
01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:05.805
You know. when they're a bit pale...

1058
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:08.070
It means it's serious.

1059
01:33:10.638 --> 01:33:15.930
We've already flown around
and taken a good look.

1060
01:33:16.930 --> 01:33:18.647
But we haven't found anything.

1061
01:33:18.731 --> 01:33:20.554
And I don't have the time.

1062
01:33:20.638 --> 01:33:22.263
It's not my job.

1063
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:26.442
And I don't have much
faith in the hierarchy.

1064
01:33:26.638 --> 01:33:28.899
It's frustrating.

1065
01:33:29.097 --> 01:33:32.263
At first. I thought. "It's just rumors.

1066
01:33:33.055 --> 01:33:34.837
It's just some

1067
01:33:35.013 --> 01:33:37.430
skeleton from the closet

1068
01:33:38.972 --> 01:33:41.263
brandished as a threat.

1069
01:33:43.263 --> 01:33:44.943
But it's disturbing.

1070
01:33:46.597 --> 01:33:49.563
It feels like they're
trying to sideline me.

1071
01:33:52.847 --> 01:33:55.179
Some time ago. I started realizing

1072
01:33:55.263 --> 01:33:58.643
the Minister is an asshole
and the President. too.

1073
01:34:01.888 --> 01:34:03.345
Always have been.

1074
01:34:04.513 --> 01:34:05.805
You've got it.

1075
01:34:06.222 --> 01:34:07.902
I'm speaking my mind.

1076
01:34:12.847 --> 01:34:15.388
In any case. it needs clarifying.

1077
01:34:16.638 --> 01:34:18.513
Discreetly. but...

1078
01:34:19.347 --> 01:34:22.630
Listen. I know I've burdened you.

1079
01:34:22.847 --> 01:34:24.375
but things get rough

1080
01:34:24.459 --> 01:34:26.972
when you can't confide in friends.

1081
01:34:28.597 --> 01:34:31.026
I'm happy to be here with you all.

1082
01:34:32.513 --> 01:34:36.013
- You chose the right people to talk to.
- I know.

1083
01:34:36.638 --> 01:34:38.888
Next time. come wearing a <i>pareo</i>.

1084
01:34:38.972 --> 01:34:41.347
- Perfect.
- That'd be better.

1085
01:34:42.097 --> 01:34:43.513
I'll ditch the suit.

1086
01:34:43.597 --> 01:34:46.306
Yeah. get rid of that getup.

1087
01:34:46.513 --> 01:34:49.617
Leave it on the plane
and come out in a <i>pareo.</i>

1088
01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:52.555
These are the moments I love.

1089
01:34:52.805 --> 01:34:56.674
And I miss them. For weeks now.

1090
01:34:56.881 --> 01:34:59.449
I've been squeezed like a lemon.

1091
01:34:59.638 --> 01:35:04.013
People are always asking me for help.

1092
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:06.263
I feel the tension.

1093
01:35:07.013 --> 01:35:09.606
When you see guys like Matahi

1094
01:35:09.805 --> 01:35:13.310
who suddenly thinks he's a warlord.

1095
01:35:13.513 --> 01:35:16.370
There's something wrong with this world.

1096
01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:19.730
I don't take him seriously.

1097
01:35:19.930 --> 01:35:23.222
What worries me is who's behind it all.

1098
01:35:38.347 --> 01:35:40.929
- Won't you sing us a song. Shannah?
- Come on.

1099
01:35:41.013 --> 01:35:43.180
- I can't sing.
- Come on.

1100
01:35:43.347 --> 01:35:45.304
- A choir song?
- A madrigal?

1101
01:35:45.388 --> 01:35:48.263
- You're a choir girl.
- No. I was one.

1102
01:35:50.805 --> 01:35:52.847
She only knows lewd songs.

1103
01:35:53.972 --> 01:35:56.138
See how she's blushing?

1104
01:35:58.472 --> 01:36:00.263
If I sang. it'd rain.

1105
01:36:01.597 --> 01:36:02.847
Me. too.

1106
01:36:03.805 --> 01:36:06.234
The crabs would come crawling out:

1107
01:36:08.347 --> 01:36:11.805
"Hey. this guy can really sing."

1108
01:36:12.472 --> 01:36:15.372
Yeah.
get reelected and then you can sing.

1109
01:36:15.472 --> 01:36:17.446
He's an artist now.

1110
01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:20.599
Should we call a car to pick us up?

1111
01:36:20.763 --> 01:36:24.289
I'll now be able to
leave with a light heart.

1112
01:36:24.513 --> 01:36:26.388
We have no worries here.

1113
01:36:28.847 --> 01:36:30.393
What a pleasure!

1114
01:36:30.597 --> 01:36:32.054
Alright. friends.

1115
01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:35.138
Let's hug and meet again soon.

1116
01:36:39.305 --> 01:36:40.388
My friend.

1117
01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:42.180
Alright.

1118
01:36:44.763 --> 01:36:46.055
See you soon.

1119
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:48.680
Mareva. you'll be staying here

1120
01:36:48.972 --> 01:36:53.430
to help them with the
rest of the campaign.

1121
01:36:54.555 --> 01:36:55.596
You'll see

1122
01:36:55.754 --> 01:36:58.806
she's highly qualified and deeply loyal.

1123
01:37:00.597 --> 01:37:02.055
My friend.

1124
01:37:03.305 --> 01:37:05.448
See you soon. in three days...

1125
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:09.110
Or maybe three months.

1126
01:37:20.513 --> 01:37:22.263
We're on time. Captain!

1127
01:37:24.013 --> 01:37:25.642
After you. Shannah.

1128
01:37:27.847 --> 01:37:29.555
Watch your heads.

1129
01:37:32.138 --> 01:37:34.680
- Have a nice flight.
- Thanks.

1130
01:38:30.012 --> 01:38:33.637
- What are they up to?
- Same game every day.

1131
01:38:35.198 --> 01:38:36.984
The same thing every day.

1132
01:38:37.115 --> 01:38:38.615
Since when?

1133
01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:43.035
This must be the sixth or seventh trip

1134
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.657
in ten days.

1135
01:38:44.865 --> 01:38:46.490
Oh. that is a lot.

1136
01:38:47.698 --> 01:38:50.399
- You know them?
- Yeah. I know the girls.

1137
01:38:50.483 --> 01:38:53.661
One of them is there every single time.

1138
01:38:53.823 --> 01:38:56.252
The others change from day to day.

1139
01:38:57.573 --> 01:38:59.645
They can't be going far

1140
01:38:59.812 --> 01:39:01.741
in a little boat like that.

1141
01:39:04.281 --> 01:39:06.638
You know there are rumors. right?

1142
01:39:06.727 --> 01:39:08.281
They say the girls...

1143
01:39:08.365 --> 01:39:10.364
I wonder what they're waiting for.

1144
01:39:10.448 --> 01:39:13.414
They say the girls are
going to a submarine.

1145
01:39:14.031 --> 01:39:15.323
A submarine?

1146
01:39:16.156 --> 01:39:17.789
You don't say!

1147
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:19.190
A submarine...

1148
01:39:21.031 --> 01:39:23.388
- James Bond style.
- So they say.

1149
01:39:23.948 --> 01:39:27.073
They go to see the guys.

1150
01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.262
I'd say they go see the marines.

1151
01:39:29.346 --> 01:39:31.824
but I'd say on a frigate.

1152
01:39:32.698 --> 01:39:34.378
A little navy frigate.

1153
01:39:50.448 --> 01:39:52.906
You say the marines are on a boat.

1154
01:39:54.531 --> 01:39:56.529
But that'd be easy to spot.

1155
01:39:56.715 --> 01:39:58.858
What if their lights were out?

1156
01:39:59.906 --> 01:40:02.365
Navy boats can evade detection.

1157
01:40:08.156 --> 01:40:09.865
You won't see anything.

1158
01:40:12.198 --> 01:40:15.055
if it's happening underwater.
I told you.

1159
01:40:16.490 --> 01:40:19.347
We should question them. question the...

1160
01:40:19.531 --> 01:40:22.431
- Captain.
- Yeah. one of the two Captains.

1161
01:40:22.656 --> 01:40:25.990
If you call that a Captain.
He's more a pimp.

1162
01:40:27.781 --> 01:40:30.115
Yeah. more like a pimp.

1163
01:40:36.865 --> 01:40:40.281
Then he checks his phone and poof.
he's gone.

1164
01:40:41.031 --> 01:40:45.948
When it's dark.
it must have its lights out.

1165
01:40:46.448 --> 01:40:48.948
I find a submarine hard to believe.

1166
01:40:50.073 --> 01:40:52.287
In the territorial waters here.

1167
01:40:53.365 --> 01:40:55.045
This here is France.

1168
01:40:55.615 --> 01:40:57.365
This is their home.

1169
01:41:00.031 --> 01:41:02.000
Yeah. but people would know

1170
01:41:02.170 --> 01:41:03.927
if a submarine was here.

1171
01:41:05.448 --> 01:41:07.656
It is known already.

1172
01:41:08.406 --> 01:41:11.510
- How do you know?
- Because there we have it.

1173
01:41:11.906 --> 01:41:13.192
I'm sure of it.

1174
01:41:14.115 --> 01:41:15.490
There's backup.

1175
01:41:16.281 --> 01:41:17.982
Who are the big guys?

1176
01:41:19.365 --> 01:41:22.222
- Have you seen them before?
- No. never.

1177
01:41:27.115 --> 01:41:29.186
I didn't bring my binoculars.

1178
01:41:29.490 --> 01:41:30.698
Shit.

1179
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:02.990
What's he saying?

1180
01:44:03.115 --> 01:44:04.115
Who?

1181
01:44:04.365 --> 01:44:05.531
Ferreira.

1182
01:44:07.115 --> 01:44:08.898
About what?

1183
01:44:09.073 --> 01:44:12.281
Did he talk about his papers.
or the Admiral...?

1184
01:44:12.365 --> 01:44:13.490
No.

1185
01:44:15.406 --> 01:44:17.086
He only just arrived.

1186
01:44:18.406 --> 01:44:20.120
He doesn't want to leave the island?

1187
01:44:20.204 --> 01:44:21.490
I don't know.

1188
01:44:38.448 --> 01:44:40.519
So you're taking care of him?

1189
01:44:41.406 --> 01:44:43.906
- You're taking care of him?
- Yeah.

1190
01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:45.670
He came for a drink.

1191
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:51.633
I want to know how long he's staying.

1192
01:44:52.615 --> 01:44:54.031
I have no idea.

1193
01:44:55.573 --> 01:44:57.253
I don't have that info.

1194
01:45:00.906 --> 01:45:02.692
Are you good friends now?

1195
01:45:02.823 --> 01:45:04.406
By now. yes.

1196
01:45:07.892 --> 01:45:09.056
It's thanks to Shannah

1197
01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:10.997
that we found your papers.

1198
01:45:12.365 --> 01:45:13.740
I remember.

1199
01:45:14.781 --> 01:45:18.281
Without her. we wouldn't have got them.

1200
01:45:19.615 --> 01:45:22.698
It's not easy to forget her eyes.

1201
01:45:26.031 --> 01:45:29.365
Almost as beautiful as
getting my passport back.

1202
01:45:32.448 --> 01:45:34.519
Once you've solved a problem.

1203
01:45:34.615 --> 01:45:36.865
you don't need explanations.

1204
01:45:38.865 --> 01:45:41.831
I know you're good
friends with the Admiral.

1205
01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:45.240
He could've helped you. too.

1206
01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:48.026
I don't know if there's a reason

1207
01:45:48.573 --> 01:45:51.281
for the three of us to work together.

1208
01:45:53.066 --> 01:45:55.066
But you know better than me.

1209
01:45:55.188 --> 01:45:56.868
I only just arrived.

1210
01:45:57.865 --> 01:45:59.494
Don't be so modest.

1211
01:46:04.115 --> 01:46:06.198
It's true that it's unusual.

1212
01:46:10.656 --> 01:46:11.740
But I...

1213
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:14.322
Especially since nothing
else went missing.

1214
01:46:14.406 --> 01:46:15.531
Exactly.

1215
01:46:17.323 --> 01:46:20.496
What can you do with a
passport on this island?

1216
01:46:25.698 --> 01:46:26.812
Fine. listen.

1217
01:46:27.365 --> 01:46:28.807
Everything's back to normal.

1218
01:46:28.891 --> 01:46:31.748
Let me know if I can
do anything for you.

1219
01:46:32.573 --> 01:46:35.198
I'll be delighted to help if I can.

1220
01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:41.573
I won't forget it.

1221
01:46:44.573 --> 01:46:46.253
You're in good hands.

1222
01:46:47.656 --> 01:46:48.990
Shannah...

1223
01:46:50.448 --> 01:46:51.740
is marvelous.

1224
01:46:54.031 --> 01:46:56.460
Thanks a lot. I'm counting on you.

1225
01:46:57.573 --> 01:46:58.906
Goodbye.

1226
01:47:06.031 --> 01:47:08.050
- Do you know him?
- Yes.

1227
01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:09.823
From the hotel.

1228
01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:12.573
A little. or...

1229
01:47:17.073 --> 01:47:20.448
We became friends gradually.

1230
01:47:24.781 --> 01:47:26.823
He took good care of you.

1231
01:47:28.948 --> 01:47:31.823
Maybe. But he takes better care of you.

1232
01:48:03.115 --> 01:48:04.865
They'll all be fooled.

1233
01:48:12.698 --> 01:48:14.031
For sure.

1234
01:48:21.573 --> 01:48:24.815
They don't know: When they see you.
it'll be me.

1235
01:48:27.615 --> 01:48:30.401
When you walk into a room. it'll be me.

1236
01:48:31.615 --> 01:48:33.972
When you go to talk. it'll be me.

1237
01:48:34.365 --> 01:48:35.615
In what way?

1238
01:48:38.906 --> 01:48:40.449
You'll be my eyes.

1239
01:48:41.198 --> 01:48:42.740
my sword arm.

1240
01:48:46.198 --> 01:48:48.412
Shannah. the High Commissioner!

1241
01:48:53.198 --> 01:48:54.878
I'll take your place.

1242
01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:58.406
Exactly.

1243
01:48:58.948 --> 01:48:59.990
Oh. yeah?

1244
01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:04.781
But no one can know.

1245
01:49:06.781 --> 01:49:08.710
You'll stay in the shadows.

1246
01:49:09.198 --> 01:49:11.353
I'll leave and they'll all rejoice

1247
01:49:11.437 --> 01:49:13.580
and think I have a lousy life.

1248
01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:15.883
that I left everything behind.

1249
01:49:19.573 --> 01:49:21.281
Everything except you.

1250
01:49:22.323 --> 01:49:23.531
Thanks.

1251
01:49:25.948 --> 01:49:28.019
You give me so much. Shannah.

1252
01:49:28.448 --> 01:49:30.305
More than you can imagine.

1253
01:49:36.073 --> 01:49:37.281
That's nice.

1254
01:49:40.698 --> 01:49:43.948
When they least expect it.
you'll strike.

1255
01:49:44.073 --> 01:49:45.702
You'll strike hard.

1256
01:49:48.323 --> 01:49:50.003
You're the predator.

1257
01:49:53.948 --> 01:49:55.491
They are the game.

1258
01:49:56.073 --> 01:49:57.156
my prey.

1259
01:50:02.365 --> 01:50:04.045
You'll eat them all.

1260
01:50:05.906 --> 01:50:07.835
You're a carnivorous beast.

1261
01:50:11.448 --> 01:50:12.698
A tigress.

1262
01:50:15.198 --> 01:50:16.655
You're a lioness.

1263
01:50:17.198 --> 01:50:18.656
A lioness...

1264
01:50:23.323 --> 01:50:25.003
- You like that?
- Yes.

1265
01:50:27.948 --> 01:50:29.240
Very much.

1266
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:28.847
- When did the Portuguese leave?
- 3 p.m.

1267
01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:32.420
Did he say anything?

1268
01:51:33.073 --> 01:51:34.072
No.

1269
01:51:37.781 --> 01:51:40.067
- What did you do to him?
- Here?

1270
01:51:41.198 --> 01:51:42.906
We had a drink.

1271
01:51:49.531 --> 01:51:51.211
Did you wear him out?

1272
01:51:51.906 --> 01:51:52.948
Not really.

1273
01:53:51.598 --> 01:53:53.955
He's wondering around in circles.

1274
01:53:59.260 --> 01:54:01.903
Do you think it's circle or a spiral?

1275
01:54:02.091 --> 01:54:04.334
I think it's a downward spiral.

1276
01:54:06.807 --> 01:54:10.234
Something dark is
controlling his emotions.

1277
01:54:14.125 --> 01:54:16.792
Let's make sure it's downward.

1278
01:54:16.973 --> 01:54:18.294
Down to the..

1279
01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:21.668
- The dark inferno.
- Yeah.

1280
01:54:26.963 --> 01:54:29.034
Can I have a little sunshine?

1281
01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:38.980
Seems he's gonna leave soon.

1282
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:29.933
It's almost empty.

1283
01:57:32.681 --> 01:57:34.138
I'll have a look.

1284
01:58:25.973 --> 01:58:27.659
Just yesterday.

1285
01:58:27.848 --> 01:58:31.348
a young man was telling
me how his grandmother

1286
01:58:32.556 --> 01:58:37.072
had thyroid cancer. breast cancer

1287
01:58:37.239 --> 01:58:39.953
and throat cancer one after the other.

1288
01:58:43.723 --> 01:58:44.848
Two.

1289
01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:50.033
Two episodes of breast cancer.

1290
01:58:55.181 --> 01:58:56.612
She was in remission

1291
01:58:56.696 --> 01:58:59.196
and then they detected a new tumor.

1292
01:59:00.056 --> 01:59:02.342
So she had both breasts removed.

1293
01:59:03.515 --> 01:59:05.120
They don't have much money

1294
01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:06.764
for breast reconstruction.

1295
01:59:06.848 --> 01:59:07.847
Really?

1296
01:59:07.985 --> 01:59:09.899
They have a lot of trouble

1297
01:59:10.110 --> 01:59:13.516
treating this kind of
disease in Polynesia.

1298
01:59:14.681 --> 01:59:17.097
That's why people are a bit nervous.

1299
01:59:17.181 --> 01:59:19.061
You could call it paranoia.

1300
01:59:19.145 --> 01:59:22.099
but isn't it more common sense?

1301
01:59:26.723 --> 01:59:29.640
Be careful. people are a bit nervous.

1302
01:59:30.473 --> 01:59:32.973
When they see a uniform like yours.

1303
01:59:33.973 --> 01:59:36.348
people here aren't too pleased.

1304
01:59:37.431 --> 01:59:41.848
I myself raise a lot of questions.
so you...

1305
01:59:45.473 --> 01:59:46.931
Knowing

1306
01:59:48.765 --> 01:59:51.723
that girls are regularly being invited

1307
01:59:53.265 --> 01:59:56.348
onboard one of your death machines...

1308
01:59:58.556 --> 02:00:01.522
People are surprised
and they ask questions.

1309
02:00:02.223 --> 02:00:03.811
The girls go there at night

1310
02:00:03.895 --> 02:00:06.324
and come back in a terrible state.

1311
02:00:09.015 --> 02:00:13.146
You should tell your
men to calm down a bit.

1312
02:00:13.348 --> 02:00:15.028
They're heavy-handed.

1313
02:00:16.473 --> 02:00:18.412
from not seeing women.

1314
02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:21.029
from staying so long at sea...

1315
02:00:21.265 --> 02:00:23.192
It must

1316
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:25.431
make you crazy. right?

1317
02:00:27.806 --> 02:00:29.390
I wonder. too.

1318
02:00:30.806 --> 02:00:32.266
If there was an accident.

1319
02:00:32.350 --> 02:00:35.057
they'd throw the girls overboard.

1320
02:00:39.098 --> 02:00:41.473
OK. let's not dwell on the girls.

1321
02:00:42.056 --> 02:00:46.598
but it could result in a big mess

1322
02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:50.197
if the rumors turn out to be true

1323
02:00:50.377 --> 02:00:53.474
and testing recommences.

1324
02:00:55.556 --> 02:00:58.223
I'm not kept up-to-date on that.

1325
02:01:00.931 --> 02:01:03.400
I wish I could tell them something.

1326
02:01:03.484 --> 02:01:05.555
but I don't have much to say.

1327
02:01:07.348 --> 02:01:09.090
And as I was saying.

1328
02:01:09.806 --> 02:01:12.181
interests hostile to our country

1329
02:01:13.098 --> 02:01:15.883
are becoming a little
too present on the island

1330
02:01:15.967 --> 02:01:18.933
and are revealing
themselves rather crudely.

1331
02:01:23.556 --> 02:01:25.306
They're not so pleasant.

1332
02:01:26.431 --> 02:01:28.217
They're more threatening.

1333
02:01:29.473 --> 02:01:31.333
I think it would piss them off

1334
02:01:31.417 --> 02:01:33.221
if we did it again.

1335
02:01:33.348 --> 02:01:35.134
Have you been threatened?

1336
02:02:19.973 --> 02:02:22.939
Try to be cheerful.
Everything will be fine.

1337
02:02:26.556 --> 02:02:28.236
Be more light-hearted.

1338
02:02:31.681 --> 02:02:33.752
Have a nice evening. Admiral.

1339
02:02:33.973 --> 02:02:35.653
I give you my word -

1340
02:02:36.306 --> 02:02:38.020
Everything will be fine.

1341
02:02:44.723 --> 02:02:45.806
Asshole.

1342
02:04:34.223 --> 02:04:36.140
Was it a good night?

1343
02:04:58.706 --> 02:05:00.274
Drive us to your place.

1344
02:05:00.358 --> 02:05:03.600
- You'll get out and I'll take the car.
- Yes sir.

1345
02:06:13.473 --> 02:06:15.015
Nothing's left.

1346
02:06:52.681 --> 02:06:55.306
Politics is like a nightclub.

1347
02:06:57.931 --> 02:06:59.680
They call this place Paradise.

1348
02:06:59.764 --> 02:07:01.393
but they're idiots.

1349
02:07:03.348 --> 02:07:05.348
It's a party with the devil.

1350
02:07:07.056 --> 02:07:08.985
They're all there together.

1351
02:07:09.806 --> 02:07:12.449
with lights beaming into their faces.

1352
02:07:12.890 --> 02:07:15.765
With strobes in the dark.

1353
02:07:17.306 --> 02:07:18.556
It's flashing.

1354
02:07:19.890 --> 02:07:21.890
they've lost their bearings.

1355
02:07:23.348 --> 02:07:26.806
They lose their balance. their memory.

1356
02:07:28.056 --> 02:07:30.847
They lose everything.
their common sense.

1357
02:07:30.931 --> 02:07:33.566
They arrive there and never leave.

1358
02:07:33.765 --> 02:07:36.139
There's no more day. no more night.

1359
02:07:36.223 --> 02:07:37.903
There's no more time.

1360
02:07:39.848 --> 02:07:41.431
That's politics:

1361
02:07:42.765 --> 02:07:44.411
people in the dark

1362
02:07:44.591 --> 02:07:47.491
who don't even look
at each other anymore.

1363
02:07:48.015 --> 02:07:50.306
Completely cut off from reality.

1364
02:07:51.806 --> 02:07:53.486
They went in there...

1365
02:07:54.140 --> 02:07:56.069
It all started with school.

1366
02:07:56.890 --> 02:07:59.015
A kind of secret society.

1367
02:07:59.598 --> 02:08:01.154
Lots of private clubs.

1368
02:08:01.238 --> 02:08:03.309
getting drunk all night long.

1369
02:08:03.973 --> 02:08:07.306
They were served food and champagne.

1370
02:08:10.723 --> 02:08:12.937
They were treated like masters.

1371
02:08:14.056 --> 02:08:15.931
They lost track of time.

1372
02:08:20.515 --> 02:08:22.351
These people will

1373
02:08:22.515 --> 02:08:24.681
tell everyone what they saw.

1374
02:08:28.806 --> 02:08:29.973
Those fools.

1375
02:08:30.306 --> 02:08:31.849
Those ignoramuses.

1376
02:08:36.021 --> 02:08:37.457
They think they're the masters.

1377
02:08:37.541 --> 02:08:40.456
but they're just made to believe that.

1378
02:08:42.265 --> 02:08:44.765
They think they control everything.

1379
02:08:45.556 --> 02:08:47.236
They control nothing.

1380
02:08:48.931 --> 02:08:50.931
Not even I control anything.

1381
02:08:53.598 --> 02:08:55.278
It's just an illusion.

1382
02:08:56.140 --> 02:08:57.926
They live in an illusion.

1383
02:09:01.681 --> 02:09:04.181
I'm gonna go into that club.

1384
02:09:04.848 --> 02:09:06.681
turn on the lights.

1385
02:09:06.806 --> 02:09:08.556
turn off the music.

1386
02:09:10.348 --> 02:09:13.640
and look into their
defeated faces one by one.

1387
02:09:14.806 --> 02:09:18.640
bloated with alcohol.
high on exhaustion.

1388
02:09:19.181 --> 02:09:23.321
their bodies withered.
their skin sagging.

1389
02:09:28.223 --> 02:09:31.723
Like a pack of dogs
tearing each other apart.

1390
02:09:34.681 --> 02:09:35.973
Listen.

1391
02:09:39.515 --> 02:09:41.468
They too sense the danger.

1392
02:09:42.098 --> 02:09:44.179
They know it's coming.

1393
02:09:45.223 --> 02:09:47.397
They know it'll blow up soon.

1394
02:09:48.890 --> 02:09:51.390
They're smarter than their masters.

1395
02:10:09.681 --> 02:10:10.806
Listen.

1396
02:10:12.515 --> 02:10:14.195
That's politics today.

1397
02:10:15.431 --> 02:10:17.111
There's nothing left.

1398
02:10:17.473 --> 02:10:19.973
There are no more men. no stature.

1399
02:10:21.306 --> 02:10:23.377
You might call them children.

1400
02:10:23.973 --> 02:10:25.161
They piss themselves.

1401
02:10:25.245 --> 02:10:27.674
thinking about nuclear explosions.

1402
02:10:28.473 --> 02:10:30.497
but cannot see the real dangers.

1403
02:10:30.581 --> 02:10:32.295
They understand nothing.

1404
02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:35.747
They don't know what awaits them.

1405
02:10:40.306 --> 02:10:43.272
We'll buy back the
plots of land one by one.

1406
02:10:51.515 --> 02:10:52.850
It won't be tests.

1407
02:10:52.934 --> 02:10:55.148
They're going to drop the bomb.

1408
02:10:57.515 --> 02:11:00.806
You'll see. The atomic waves will go

1409
02:11:01.181 --> 02:11:03.960
all around their little world.

1410
02:11:07.015 --> 02:11:08.558
We'll be far away.

1411
02:11:09.473 --> 02:11:11.265
Yeah. we'll have left.

1412
02:11:12.765 --> 02:11:14.806
We'll have left their slum.

1413
02:11:17.681 --> 02:11:19.473
So before I leave.

1414
02:11:21.265 --> 02:11:23.431
I'll go back into their dump

1415
02:11:25.681 --> 02:11:27.138
and burn it down.

1416
02:11:28.765 --> 02:11:30.890
I'll fry them all to a crisp.

1417
02:11:34.515 --> 02:11:36.431
I'll burn them all.

1418
02:11:42.181 --> 02:11:43.861
Nothing will survive.

1419
02:11:44.181 --> 02:11:45.681
Nothing at all.

1420
02:11:45.806 --> 02:11:48.163
They can hide in their submarine.

1421
02:11:51.556 --> 02:11:54.640
They'll end up rotting in there.
their tomb.

1422
02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:01.931
When the bomb is dropped.
nothing will remain.

1423
02:12:05.931 --> 02:12:08.390
When they resurface after weeks.

1424
02:12:12.056 --> 02:12:13.624
they'll take their rusty ladder

1425
02:12:13.708 --> 02:12:16.279
and open the hatch out in the ocean.

1426
02:12:16.890 --> 02:12:19.104
What do you think will be left?

1427
02:12:20.265 --> 02:12:22.348
They'll look real stupid.

1428
02:12:27.390 --> 02:12:29.819
They'll eat each other to survive.

1429
02:12:34.556 --> 02:12:37.056
While I'm far. far away.

1430
02:12:43.348 --> 02:12:46.556
I won't see them grow old. feeble.

1431
02:12:48.223 --> 02:12:50.306
with their deformed children.

1432
02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:53.269
their sick wives...

1433
02:13:02.098 --> 02:13:03.973
Alright. it's ready.

1434
02:13:05.598 --> 02:13:07.306
Your boat awaits you.

1435
02:13:07.598 --> 02:13:09.056
Great. Now?

1436
02:13:09.556 --> 02:13:13.147
- Whenever you want. Are you taking him?
- Yes.

1437
02:13:14.515 --> 02:13:15.723
You trust him?

1438
02:13:16.473 --> 02:13:17.930
Yes. Look at him.

1439
02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:20.320
Sleeping like a baby.

1440
02:13:24.306 --> 02:13:25.986
Meet you at the pier.

1441
02:13:30.765 --> 02:13:31.931
Ready?

1442
02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:35.348
Good.

1443
02:16:53.292 --> 02:16:54.405
Well?

1444
02:16:54.584 --> 02:16:57.251
Nothing. It's driving me crazy.

1445
02:16:57.459 --> 02:16:59.326
You didn't hear a thing?

1446
02:16:59.467 --> 02:17:02.335
No lights. no engine sound. no girls.

1447
02:17:03.792 --> 02:17:04.959
Me neither.

1448
02:17:05.084 --> 02:17:07.167
I don't know the time.
but we're not late.

1449
02:17:07.251 --> 02:17:08.626
It's almost 6.

1450
02:17:09.334 --> 02:17:10.751
Almost 6.

1451
02:17:11.042 --> 02:17:14.126
We don't want to get spotted

1452
02:17:15.001 --> 02:17:16.630
when the sun rises.

1453
02:17:16.917 --> 02:17:18.459
Let's do another 15 minutes.

1454
02:17:18.543 --> 02:17:20.000
then meet at the beach.

1455
02:17:20.084 --> 02:17:22.037
You'll go due east.

1456
02:17:22.209 --> 02:17:24.863
Cut the motor occasionally
so you can hear...

1457
02:17:24.947 --> 02:17:25.958
I did. but...

1458
02:17:26.042 --> 02:17:27.501
Same here.

1459
02:17:27.667 --> 02:17:29.953
We've been at it for four hours.

1460
02:17:34.876 --> 02:17:36.024
See you in 20 minutes?

1461
02:17:36.108 --> 02:17:37.793
20 minutes it is.

1462
02:33:03.579 --> 02:33:06.663
- You OK?
- Yes. yes. I'm fine.

1463
02:33:31.746 --> 02:33:33.371
I didn't hear.

1464
02:38:27.288 --> 02:38:28.871
Gentlemen. listen.

1465
02:38:29.079 --> 02:38:31.293
We leave today for the islands.

1466
02:38:33.413 --> 02:38:35.093
We shall not return.

1467
02:38:35.496 --> 02:38:38.282
Abandon everything that keeps you here.

1468
02:38:43.829 --> 02:38:46.729
We'll pick up the last
remaining engineers

1469
02:38:47.004 --> 02:38:48.643
who are indispensable

1470
02:38:48.727 --> 02:38:50.870
for accomplishing our mission.

1471
02:38:53.413 --> 02:38:55.484
Everything has been prepared.

1472
02:38:57.454 --> 02:38:59.811
The first firing will be at dawn.

1473
02:39:00.079 --> 02:39:01.913
The first in 20 years.

1474
02:39:02.288 --> 02:39:03.538
20 years

1475
02:39:03.913 --> 02:39:05.663
that we've been waiting

1476
02:39:06.371 --> 02:39:10.538
to elevate our status
to that of a great power.

1477
02:39:15.621 --> 02:39:17.835
We'll make them fear the worst.

1478
02:39:20.288 --> 02:39:22.246
You must have courage

1479
02:39:22.496 --> 02:39:24.913
for what you're about to do.

1480
02:39:25.663 --> 02:39:27.538
Yes! Courage!

1481
02:39:28.121 --> 02:39:29.621
And heart!

1482
02:39:30.329 --> 02:39:31.913
And that you have!

1483
02:39:34.788 --> 02:39:36.574
You fear your own public.

1484
02:39:37.163 --> 02:39:38.913
but don't fret:

1485
02:39:39.163 --> 02:39:42.829
Where we are going.
no one will recognize you.

1486
02:39:43.079 --> 02:39:45.871
Because no one knows about our mission.

1487
02:39:49.496 --> 02:39:52.746
20 years ago.
we made the mistake of believing

1488
02:39:53.288 --> 02:39:56.746
they would understand what sacrifice is.

1489
02:40:01.288 --> 02:40:03.743
Only those who should fear us

1490
02:40:03.828 --> 02:40:06.705
will see what we are capable of!

1491
02:40:10.704 --> 02:40:12.161
One day. perhaps.

1492
02:40:12.496 --> 02:40:14.782
others will recognize your work.

1493
02:40:16.204 --> 02:40:17.413
And that day

1494
02:40:17.538 --> 02:40:20.118
the world will have changed!
