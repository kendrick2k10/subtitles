00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.125
-Good morning. Maryam
-Good morning. Adnan.

4
00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:04.417
-Good morning. Nasser.
-Good morning.

5
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.083
Thank you.

6
00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:10.917
I wish you a good flight.
and congratulate Sheikh Muhammed for me.

7
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.250
Thank you very much. Adnan.

8
00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:15.125
Careful not to break it.

9
00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:21.417
Hello.

10
00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:25.542
-Cancelled? What do you mean. cancelled?
-What is cancelled?

11
00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:27.958
We're just out with our suitcases
heading toward the airport.

12
00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:30.333
How could it be cancelled
and no one notifies me ahead of time?

13
00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:33.167
Fine. figure out any other flight.

14
00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:35.292
Do you know who you're talking to?

15
00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:37.375
I'm Nasser. Mohammad Al Muhammed's son.

16
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.333
I'm telling you. I have an event
in Abu Dhabi tonight.

17
00:03:41.417 --> 00:03:42.500
Find us any flight.

18
00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:43.792
What?

19
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.583
Today's flight was cancelled.
and there are no flights till tomorrow.

20
00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:51.167
You're happy. aren't you?
Who will spare us Dad's anger?

21
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.583
We'll find a way.

22
00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:58.875
Things seem to be off. Dad.
We're out with our suitcases.

23
00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.333
They called and said
there are no flights until tomorrow.

24
00:04:01.417 --> 00:04:04.583
We really wanted to be there with you.
but it seems that we're out of luck.

25
00:04:06.208 --> 00:04:08.125
<i>I guess it's settled then. Hit the road.</i>

26
00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:10.458
Road? What road?

27
00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:13.792
<i>What do you mean. what road?</i>
<i>I’m not telling you to walk here.</i>

28
00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:15.042
<i>It's Abu Dhabi.</i>

29
00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:18.625
<i>Once you reach the highway.</i>
<i>you'll find signs all over the place.</i>

30
00:04:19.917 --> 00:04:22.000
<i>You’ll be here in eight hours.</i>

31
00:04:22.083 --> 00:04:26.042
<i>and still have enough time to shower</i>
<i>and look great for the wedding.</i>

32
00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:31.833
<i>This marriage is important.</i>
<i>Not just for me. not at all.</i>

33
00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:35.500
<i>It's important for you too.</i>
<i>For our life and our family.</i>

34
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.667
<i>May your mother rest in peace.</i>
<i>May she rest in peace.</i>

35
00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:42.292
<i>Having you here tonight</i>
<i>matters so much to me.</i>

36
00:04:42.792 --> 00:04:46.083
Okay. don’t get upset.
we’ll be with you tonight.

37
00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:50.708
<i>Okay. By the way. Nasser.</i>
<i>Any news about what I asked you to do?</i>

38
00:04:51.417 --> 00:04:54.042
Dad. I'm still working on it.

39
00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:55.792
<i>Still working on it?</i>

40
00:04:55.917 --> 00:04:59.417
<i>When you can't do the simple things</i>
<i>that I ask of you.</i>

41
00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:00.958
<i>just tell me from the start.</i>

42
00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:03.125
<i>Why let me count on you and waste my time?</i>

43
00:05:03.417 --> 00:05:07.417
<i>If you can't do things right.</i>
<i>let me find someone else who can. okay?</i>

44
00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:09.542
Okay.

45
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.792
Take care of the house. Adnan.

46
00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:13.833
We'll be back in a couple of days.

47
00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:49.625
It’s been ages
since I went on a drive this long.

48
00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:52.458
Maybe since the days of Obhur in Jeddah.

49
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.792
Same here.

50
00:05:55.583 --> 00:05:57.792
Are you sure
you didn't want Adnan to drive us?

51
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.792
It's a very long ride.

52
00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:03.625
Why drag him along
and make him suffer along with us?

53
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.750
That was nice of you.

54
00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:07.667
You have exceptional manners
in the morning.

55
00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.917
I have exceptional manners
every morning. sister.

56
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.500
but you’re just discovering them now.

57
00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:13.958
If I saw you more often.
I would have discovered long ago.

58
00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:19.542
Is Dad involving you
with this site as well?

59
00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:22.458
Of course.

60
00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:28.375
If a construction site says Al Muhammed.
it means I’m personally involved with it.

61
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.542
It must be hard working for Dad.

62
00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:37.458
Maryam. I work with Dad. not for him.

63
00:06:38.417 --> 00:06:40.667
Do you still draw. or did you stop?

64
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.833
I still remember you as a kid.
you were so talented.

65
00:06:43.917 --> 00:06:45.833
You drew so well.

66
00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:48.667
I thought that’s what
you were going to do with your life.

67
00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:52.833
Drawing is not a job.

68
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.875
I don't know. I remember you saying
that you'd be the best graphic designer.

69
00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.417
and that you'd use your talent
to get to your dream and all.

70
00:07:02.542 --> 00:07:03.792
What happened?

71
00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:07.167
Are you going to hold me
to something I said as a child?

72
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.875
Dreams change.

73
00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.417
So working for Dad was one of your dreams?

74
00:07:12.292 --> 00:07:14.042
With Dad.

75
00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:35.458
Dear Lord. I hope they're all right.

76
00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:42.667
I bet you see stuff like this
every day at the hospital. right?

77
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.042
You won’t believe the things
we see in the ER. Nasser.

78
00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:50.500
Like what? Smashed skulls?
Bodies in pieces?

79
00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:51.792
You’re so messed up.

80
00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:55.583
A car crash happens every minute
of every day in Saudi Arabia.

81
00:07:55.667 --> 00:07:56.917
Just imagine the injuries.

82
00:07:57.042 --> 00:07:59.708
I'm not exactly joking.
I really want to know what you see.

83
00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:01.042
I'm just curious.

84
00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:02.708
God. the horrible things I see…

85
00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:06.375
I sometimes believe that I see cases
worse than those even in wars.

86
00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:10.125
Hard as I try to sympathize and see things
from your perspective. I just can't.

87
00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:12.125
They come driving
at a million miles per hour.

88
00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:14.083
speeding down a highway
as if it were their own.

89
00:08:14.167 --> 00:08:15.417
What do they expect?

90
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.750
-They're asking for it.
-I wish they knew better.

91
00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:28.750
LAWYER RAED
CASE FOLLOW-UP

92
00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:31.167
Get witnesses opposing testimonials.
Non-citizens are easily handled.

93
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.542
-Nasser.
-What?

94
00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:52.292
Watch the road. please.

95
00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:53.500
Sure.

96
00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:07.667
What an idiot.

97
00:09:08.458 --> 00:09:10.417
Is he crazy driving like that?

98
00:09:29.542 --> 00:09:32.167
Look what we have here.

99
00:09:34.542 --> 00:09:35.708
What's the word?

100
00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:42.417
-Karma?
-Karma.

101
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.042
Now let that drift pick you up. buddy.

102
00:10:13.208 --> 00:10:15.750
Wait. If he really needs help.
what will he do?

103
00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:19.833
Someone else will stop.
It’s not our problem.

104
00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:39.208
Are you seriously putting on makeup now?
We’re about to enter the desert.

105
00:10:39.292 --> 00:10:42.208
This isn’t makeup. moron. It’s Kohl.

106
00:10:42.292 --> 00:10:45.292
It protects your eyes
from the sun. from the dust.

107
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.250
-You want some?
-Thank you. but. no. thank you.

108
00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:51.083
Even the prophet used it.

109
00:10:51.208 --> 00:10:57.125
This is my favorite gift from Mom.
She got it in Medina I think.

110
00:10:57.208 --> 00:10:59.333
Be careful with that thing.

111
00:10:59.417 --> 00:11:00.583
No. seriously. watch it.

112
00:11:00.667 --> 00:11:02.750
If we hit a bump.
you’ll stab yourself in the eye.

113
00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:04.542
and. blech.
it'll pop and splatter all over.

114
00:11:04.667 --> 00:11:07.542
If you would just drive correctly.
there'll be no "blech" nor splatter.

115
00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:17.375
Remember the song
Mom used to sing on our road trips?

116
00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:19.292
Which one? Abadi's song?

117
00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:21.542
-That's the one.
-Yeah. how did it go?

118
00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:23.125
Abadi Al Johar's song.

119
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.417
<i>-A long road…</i>
<i>-A long road…</i>

120
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.625
That's it.

121
00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:32.250
-What was it?
<i>-And the…</i>

122
00:11:34.792 --> 00:11:38.042
-I forgot the lyrics.
-Me too. I can't seem to remember.

123
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.625
God. I miss Mom so much.

124
00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:46.250
So do I.

125
00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:47.958
You think Dad misses her?

126
00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:50.667
For sure. just maybe
not on his wedding day.

127
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.458
He never talks about her.

128
00:11:52.542 --> 00:11:54.375
You know how Dad is.

129
00:11:54.458 --> 00:11:56.750
He's not the type
to express emotions easily or talk much.

130
00:11:59.125 --> 00:12:00.958
You never talk about her either.

131
00:12:01.625 --> 00:12:03.833
She’s always on my mind. Maryam.

132
00:12:03.917 --> 00:12:06.417
I always try to remember her
and pray for her.

133
00:12:07.917 --> 00:12:11.208
But whenever I try to remember
anything before her cancer.

134
00:12:11.292 --> 00:12:13.667
it’s all a blur.

135
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.417
Nasser. that's exactly why
you have to talk about her.

136
00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:18.417
Honestly.

137
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.458
She's your mother. How can you only
remember her cancer and her illness?

138
00:12:21.542 --> 00:12:24.958
Every time you talk about her.
you’ll remember new things.

139
00:12:25.042 --> 00:12:26.375
Believe me.

140
00:12:27.333 --> 00:12:28.833
Maybe. Right.

141
00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.333
And us?

142
00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:34.375
We live in the same house
and I haven’t seen you for months.

143
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:37.917
I know that. Maryam.

144
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.250
You know we haven’t sat together
since the funeral?

145
00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:48.250
You know I’m always working.
Barely a minute to catch my breath.

146
00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:51.500
I work all the time. too. Nasser.

147
00:12:51.583 --> 00:12:54.458
If we can’t find time for each other.
who will we find it for?

148
00:12:59.875 --> 00:13:01.167
Nasser. I’m talking to you.

149
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.458
I’m listening. but there’s important
work stuff I need to deal with.

150
00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:06.875
I wished you were there
at the hospital with me.

151
00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.500
I was hoping we could tell her together.

152
00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:12.958
Nasser. I told her.

153
00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:15.208
What did you tell her?

154
00:13:15.708 --> 00:13:17.958
About what we did
at the beach resort in Jeddah.

155
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.500
-Did you really tell her about that?
-I did.

156
00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:27.250
What did she say?

157
00:13:27.333 --> 00:13:30.208
She said kids don’t know better.
We meant no malice.

158
00:13:31.583 --> 00:13:33.125
And that God is merciful and forgiving.

159
00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:29.958
Here’s the guy you felt sorry for.
Driving like a maniac again.

160
00:14:30.042 --> 00:14:32.167
Great. I was feeling guilty about that.

161
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.125
-Nasser what are you doing?
-I'm trying to let him pass.

162
00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:48.292
What the hell?

163
00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:51.417
Nasser! Nasser!

164
00:14:58.042 --> 00:14:59.833
No. he’s really pushing it now.

165
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.833
Get off my back. Get out of here. go.

166
00:15:33.125 --> 00:15:34.250
Nasser!

167
00:16:02.042 --> 00:16:04.292
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to deal with him.

168
00:16:04.375 --> 00:16:06.833
-Apologize to him.
-He’s the one who has to apologize.

169
00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:11.000
Apologize and get us out of this. please.

170
00:16:11.125 --> 00:16:12.333
What?

171
00:16:15.625 --> 00:16:17.000
What's your problem?

172
00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:23.292
I apologize. But you were the one
riding my ass back there.

173
00:16:31.667 --> 00:16:35.625
I’m sorry. If you want to talk about it.
get out of the car. we’ll talk about it.

174
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.708
Nasser! Nasser!

175
00:16:49.292 --> 00:16:50.417
Nasser.

176
00:16:55.833 --> 00:16:58.083
Hold still. it’s going to sting.

177
00:16:58.167 --> 00:17:00.417
-Okay. gently.
-Gently.

178
00:17:05.333 --> 00:17:06.375
Just breathe.

179
00:17:14.417 --> 00:17:16.375
This guy's a psychopath.
I bet he's not sober.

180
00:17:21.417 --> 00:17:23.125
Let's call the police.

181
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:29.042
It’s pointless.
If we have to wait and talk to the police.

182
00:17:29.583 --> 00:17:32.375
we’ll never get to Abu Dhabi in time
and we’ll be late for the wedding.

183
00:17:33.042 --> 00:17:34.083
Easy there. easy.

184
00:17:34.917 --> 00:17:36.375
You’re such a crybaby.

185
00:17:36.792 --> 00:17:38.417
Easy for you to say.

186
00:17:48.042 --> 00:17:49.667
Thank you. seriously.

187
00:17:50.792 --> 00:17:52.208
Most welcome.

188
00:17:54.333 --> 00:17:55.875
Should I drive?

189
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.375
No. I'll drive. I’m fine.

190
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.708
-Ninety-five full. please.
-Okay.

191
00:18:24.792 --> 00:18:27.083
Did a white Jeep
stop here a little while ago?

192
00:18:27.167 --> 00:18:28.542
No. no Jeep.

193
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.292
-Good day.
-Good day to you. sir.

194
00:19:16.458 --> 00:19:20.625
THE ARAB PLATFORM

195
00:19:43.208 --> 00:19:45.833
All I need is for him not to demand
anything from me in court.

196
00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:48.833
Am I the one to teach you
how to do your job?

197
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.917
I beg you to wrap it up. I don't want Dad
to ask me again when I see him tonight.

198
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.792
For God's sake. just wrap it up.

199
00:19:56.042 --> 00:19:58.208
Okay. check it out and let me know.

200
00:19:59.208 --> 00:20:00.667
All right. bye.

201
00:20:03.375 --> 00:20:05.958
-Hello there.
-Hello.

202
00:20:06.667 --> 00:20:10.292
-What's with your head?
-I cut myself shaving.

203
00:20:10.458 --> 00:20:12.500
I think you had the mirror upside down.

204
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.583
Did a white Jeep get any fuel
from your station a while ago?

205
00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:19.958
Nope.

206
00:20:20.083 --> 00:20:23.000
Did a white Jeep drive past the station?

207
00:20:23.083 --> 00:20:26.792
Son. I’ve been sitting here for 25 years.

208
00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:31.000
You kind of stop looking at the road
after the first 15.

209
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:33.375
Is there a police station nearby?

210
00:20:33.875 --> 00:20:38.167
No. but there are some patrol cars
now and then.

211
00:20:38.917 --> 00:20:41.583
Are you here to ask questions
or buy something? What's your deal?

212
00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:04.000
Where's that worker? Did you pay him?

213
00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:05.375
Yes. I did.

214
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.667
-I'm going to pray.
-Okay. great.

215
00:21:44.583 --> 00:21:46.375
Allah is the greatest.

216
00:21:46.458 --> 00:21:49.292
All greetings and prayers
and good deeds are for Allah.

217
00:21:54.292 --> 00:21:56.875
Allah is the greatest.

218
00:22:05.875 --> 00:22:08.250
Allah's peace and mercy be upon you.

219
00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:10.500
Allah's peace and mercy be upon you.

220
00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.958
Oh. come on. What the hell?

221
00:23:06.417 --> 00:23:07.958
What's with you?

222
00:23:08.542 --> 00:23:10.583
I came out of the mosque
and my shoes were gone.

223
00:23:10.667 --> 00:23:13.000
-What do you mean?
-No idea. Did you see anyone?

224
00:23:13.083 --> 00:23:15.250
No. I was alone in there.

225
00:23:15.333 --> 00:23:16.458
Hey.

226
00:23:18.083 --> 00:23:20.708
Excuse me.

227
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:28.750
My good man.

228
00:23:28.833 --> 00:23:31.375
Nobody treats me that way. bitch.
You can run. but you can’t hide.

229
00:23:33.083 --> 00:23:35.000
-Are you talking to me?
-Excuse me. yes. I am.

230
00:23:35.083 --> 00:23:36.750
I think you have my shoes on.

231
00:23:36.833 --> 00:23:38.083
-Excuse me?
-The shoes you have.

232
00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:40.583
You must've mixed them up.
but I guess they're mine.

233
00:23:40.667 --> 00:23:42.583
Do I look so blind as to mistake
my own shoes?

234
00:23:42.708 --> 00:23:45.250
I didn’t call you blind.
Can you take them off so I can see?

235
00:23:45.375 --> 00:23:47.833
Take what off? Hit the road
before I smash your face in. buddy.

236
00:23:47.917 --> 00:23:50.333
Could you please speak more politely
and show me the shoes?

237
00:23:50.417 --> 00:23:52.583
-Speak politely. Are you sober?
-I want to see it.

238
00:23:52.667 --> 00:23:56.250
Whoa. Here. what's this?
Look at it closely.

239
00:23:56.333 --> 00:23:59.125
Is this your shoe?
This one. is it your shoe? Is it?

240
00:23:59.208 --> 00:24:01.042
-What's with you. man?
-They're similar. sorry.

241
00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:03.167
-Nasser.
-I'm sorry. I apologize.

242
00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.542
Sorry? I told you it was my damn thing.
Get the hell out of here.

243
00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:09.167
Calm down. please.
He said that he didn't mean it.

244
00:24:10.958 --> 00:24:13.958
By the looks of you and your car.
it's clear how you treat others.

245
00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:15.875
Be grateful she's with you.

246
00:24:15.958 --> 00:24:18.542
I would have beat you to a pulp
and buried you right here.

247
00:24:18.625 --> 00:24:20.042
Are you stupid or something?

248
00:24:27.542 --> 00:24:28.708
Are you for real?

249
00:24:37.833 --> 00:24:39.583
You need to improve
your attitude with others.

250
00:24:39.708 --> 00:24:41.917
In these situations.
can you let me do the talking?

251
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.083
Sure. you’re clearly so good at talking.

252
00:24:45.542 --> 00:24:47.833
Who took those God damn shoes?

253
00:25:04.125 --> 00:25:05.833
Are you going to drive barefoot?

254
00:25:06.583 --> 00:25:09.000
These are the wedding shoes.
I don't want to mess them up.

255
00:25:09.083 --> 00:25:13.042
What do you care what other people think?
Do what makes you comfortable.

256
00:25:14.042 --> 00:25:16.500
Says the lady
with the highest heels on Earth.

257
00:25:17.625 --> 00:25:19.625
You mean the smallest heels on Earth.

258
00:25:20.875 --> 00:25:22.083
Why do you care anyway?

259
00:25:22.167 --> 00:25:25.333
You know the only reason
Dad wants us there is to show us off.

260
00:25:25.417 --> 00:25:27.708
You want him to see me
with creased or dirty shoes?

261
00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:30.333
No. I don't want that at all.

262
00:25:31.083 --> 00:25:32.750
GUILTY

263
00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:34.125
What now?

264
00:25:34.875 --> 00:25:36.500
Seriously. what now?

265
00:25:47.625 --> 00:25:49.750
Sir. hey. sir!

266
00:25:49.833 --> 00:25:52.458
The white Jeep you were asking about
was just here!

267
00:26:31.042 --> 00:26:33.083
-Hey.
-Yeah.

268
00:26:34.542 --> 00:26:36.458
-Nasser?
-Yes?

269
00:26:36.625 --> 00:26:38.667
You’re driving too fast.
Can you slow down?

270
00:26:38.833 --> 00:26:42.792
Maryam. will you please let me drive
and distract yourself with anything?

271
00:26:42.958 --> 00:26:44.208
Okay.

272
00:26:44.292 --> 00:26:48.000
We've been through some weird stuff.
but that's what road trips are all about.

273
00:26:48.125 --> 00:26:50.958
Trust me. it's a pain now.
but in two years. we'll laugh about this.

274
00:26:51.042 --> 00:26:52.833
We’ll die laughing.

275
00:26:52.917 --> 00:26:56.583
When my skull is crushed under
the Jeep's wheel. I'll die laughing.

276
00:26:57.958 --> 00:26:59.667
Maybe you need a sip of water.

277
00:27:04.042 --> 00:27:05.500
Did you get any water anyway?

278
00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:10.125
Here you are.

279
00:27:20.542 --> 00:27:21.583
Thanks.

280
00:27:25.667 --> 00:27:30.042
Did you know that Route 10 is the world’s
longest stretch of straight road?

281
00:27:31.167 --> 00:27:32.667
Delightful.

282
00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:38.000
Hello.

283
00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:41.708
Yes. hello.

284
00:27:42.667 --> 00:27:44.250
I can't hear you. speak up.

285
00:27:44.958 --> 00:27:46.208
No coverage.

286
00:27:47.167 --> 00:27:48.417
Hello?

287
00:27:51.667 --> 00:27:53.375
We're out of coverage
until we get to Batha.

288
00:27:53.458 --> 00:27:55.292
-Can I use yours for a sec?
-No.

289
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.375
What difference will it make? Nasser.

290
00:27:59.458 --> 00:28:01.583
-What's this. Maryam?
-It's nothing.

291
00:28:02.625 --> 00:28:05.375
-What's written there? Who sent it?
-No one.

292
00:28:05.917 --> 00:28:08.583
No one? Did the texts fall from the sky?
Who’s threatening you?

293
00:28:08.708 --> 00:28:11.667
-My friends.
-Your friends threaten you like this?

294
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.083
-No. they joke like that.
-That's a joke?

295
00:28:15.208 --> 00:28:17.542
Yes. don't you have any friends
that you joke around with?

296
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.292
Nasser. Are you okay?

297
00:28:52.833 --> 00:28:55.500
Maryam. I don't feel so good.
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

298
00:28:56.958 --> 00:29:00.000
I think you got a concussion
from the fall. Nasser.

299
00:29:01.583 --> 00:29:02.875
Can I drive instead?

300
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.292
Honestly. I should be driving. please.

301
00:29:06.667 --> 00:29:09.708
Yeah. I think you’re right. You drive.

302
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.625
Shit. This guy has it in for us.
Maryam. get in.

303
00:29:35.542 --> 00:29:37.542
Just let him pass and get rid of him.

304
00:29:37.625 --> 00:29:39.708
I tried to do that last time. didn’t I?

305
00:29:39.792 --> 00:29:42.042
Make it clearer!

306
00:29:42.125 --> 00:29:43.625
I was clear!

307
00:29:43.708 --> 00:29:45.750
Why are you blaming me for this?
Calm down.

308
00:29:50.083 --> 00:29:51.917
Go ahead and leave me alone.

309
00:30:00.042 --> 00:30:01.917
The bastard’s blocking us.

310
00:30:04.917 --> 00:30:06.083
What’s he doing?

311
00:30:12.833 --> 00:30:13.958
Nasser!

312
00:31:01.958 --> 00:31:04.375
Dear God!
Is this guy trying to kill us or what?

313
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.375
Maryam. calm down!
I have enough to deal with!

314
00:31:11.167 --> 00:31:12.250
What are you doing?

315
00:31:14.958 --> 00:31:16.875
Trying to reason with him.

316
00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:18.917
Maybe if he sees a human being.
he’ll back off.

317
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.458
Back off! Back off!
What have we done to you?

318
00:31:22.417 --> 00:31:23.792
What is this?

319
00:31:24.417 --> 00:31:25.708
No.

320
00:31:27.083 --> 00:31:29.958
Maryam. get back here.
The steering's stuck. I can't move.

321
00:32:13.583 --> 00:32:15.583
You crazy girl. I love you.

322
00:32:35.958 --> 00:32:37.708
Why was he trying to kill us?

323
00:32:42.792 --> 00:32:45.375
You remember that terrible accident
a few months ago?

324
00:32:46.792 --> 00:32:48.417
The crane that collapsed on the workers?

325
00:32:50.125 --> 00:32:54.167
Those workers had no training
or safety equipment.

326
00:32:55.875 --> 00:32:59.375
When the crane crashed.
it killed them instantly. crushed them.

327
00:33:00.042 --> 00:33:01.625
Except for one of them.

328
00:33:02.458 --> 00:33:04.500
He survived. but he watched
his brother die before his eyes.

329
00:33:04.625 --> 00:33:06.667
Are you saying that could be him?

330
00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:09.000
Maybe he wants revenge.

331
00:33:09.583 --> 00:33:11.125
Maybe he thinks I killed his brother.

332
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.208
Maybe I did kill his brother.

333
00:33:18.667 --> 00:33:21.167
You don’t know what Dad’s like at work.

334
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:25.125
He’s rough and merciless.
without a thought for the workers.

335
00:33:25.792 --> 00:33:28.625
This is the shit
I’ve been dealing with all day.

336
00:33:28.708 --> 00:33:31.750
He wants me to deport the worker
to avoid paying any compensation.

337
00:33:36.625 --> 00:33:39.417
I hate working with him. Maryam.
I hate it.

338
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.292
I wish I had never worked with him.

339
00:33:43.375 --> 00:33:46.208
so I would not know
this side of his personality.

340
00:33:47.292 --> 00:33:51.208
But you said
it was a construction accident. Nasser.

341
00:33:51.333 --> 00:33:53.375
It’s not your fault. it’s theirs.

342
00:33:55.792 --> 00:33:58.917
Well. if it’s not him.
who would want to do this to us?

343
00:34:02.125 --> 00:34:03.417
There is someone.

344
00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.125
The man who’s been texting me all day.

345
00:34:11.583 --> 00:34:13.833
This man. huh?

346
00:34:13.917 --> 00:34:16.958
So it’s not your friends
kidding around with you.

347
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.333
Who is he?

348
00:34:20.667 --> 00:34:24.417
You know Dad’s friend Saad?

349
00:34:25.625 --> 00:34:26.792
This guy's his son.

350
00:34:26.875 --> 00:34:28.833
The Saad who owns all those hotels?

351
00:34:30.833 --> 00:34:32.667
He's been obsessed with me for a while.

352
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.542
He even proposed to me officially.

353
00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:38.500
Dad started pressuring me. saying how good
it would be for us. business-wise.

354
00:34:38.583 --> 00:34:42.833
That he'll open many opportunities
and we won't get a better man. you know.

355
00:34:42.917 --> 00:34:44.292
As always.

356
00:34:44.917 --> 00:34:47.917
I said no. I did so respectfully.

357
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.375
He took it so personally.
He was so humiliated.

358
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:57.542
He hasn’t stopped texting me
and harassing me since then.

359
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.708
What did Dad say when you told him?

360
00:35:00.792 --> 00:35:02.500
-I didn't tell him.
-Why not?

361
00:35:02.583 --> 00:35:05.250
I was sure he would take his side.
you bet I didn’t tell him.

362
00:35:06.708 --> 00:35:09.583
I wanted to tell you.
but honestly. I didn't want any trouble.

363
00:35:09.708 --> 00:35:12.583
You should have told me.
I would've beat the crap out that bastard.

364
00:35:12.667 --> 00:35:15.750
That’s exactly the kind of trouble
I wanted to avoid!

365
00:35:16.458 --> 00:35:19.333
If it was more than I could handle.
I would have asked for your help.

366
00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:23.125
But I’m telling you.
he’s all talk and text messages.

367
00:35:23.208 --> 00:35:25.042
Unless that’s him behind us. Maryam.

368
00:35:25.125 --> 00:35:27.208
The guy behind us
has done a lot of planning.

369
00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:30.125
This prick is a hothead. not a planner.

370
00:35:31.792 --> 00:35:34.917
Fine. just tell me who would sit
and plan all of this out?

371
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.375
Is there anything valuable in the car?

372
00:35:44.875 --> 00:35:46.750
No. nothing valuable.

373
00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:50.750
Except for Dad's wedding present.

374
00:35:50.875 --> 00:35:53.667
What? Dad said no gifts.

375
00:35:54.458 --> 00:35:58.458
Maryam. you should know that
no gifts never actually means no gifts.

376
00:35:58.542 --> 00:36:01.708
-What did you get him?
-A gilded Jambiya dagger.

377
00:36:02.875 --> 00:36:06.000
-How much did it cost?
-A hundred grand or so.

378
00:36:06.083 --> 00:36:08.292
A hundred grand! A hundred grand!

379
00:36:08.417 --> 00:36:09.583
Or so.

380
00:36:09.708 --> 00:36:12.708
Wow. so much love.

381
00:36:12.792 --> 00:36:14.833
Anyway. no one knows we have it.

382
00:36:14.917 --> 00:36:18.375
I bought it.
put it in the car. and that was it.

383
00:36:18.458 --> 00:36:21.208
-Didn't Adnan drive you to buy it?
-So what?

384
00:36:21.292 --> 00:36:23.250
-Then Adnan knows.
-So?

385
00:36:23.833 --> 00:36:26.417
Adnan knows all our travel plans
for the day.

386
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.750
Are you accusing Adnan of all this?

387
00:36:30.917 --> 00:36:32.542
I'm just thinking out loud.

388
00:36:32.625 --> 00:36:35.250
Adnan was a mechanic back in Pakistan.

389
00:36:35.333 --> 00:36:38.458
And that Jeep behind us
is pretty souped-up.

390
00:36:38.542 --> 00:36:39.750
not your ordinary car.

391
00:36:39.833 --> 00:36:42.333
There's no way on earth.
Are you even listening to yourself?

392
00:36:42.417 --> 00:36:46.417
Dad's always insulting Adnan. Nasser.
He does it in front of me.

393
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.583
But still. it wouldn’t push him
to something like this.

394
00:36:49.417 --> 00:36:52.458
"Beware the anger of the patient."
That's all I know.

395
00:36:54.708 --> 00:36:57.125
Great. Just great.

396
00:36:57.208 --> 00:36:59.958
So far. we have three people
who want us dead.

397
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.667
Four. The boy from Jeddah.

398
00:37:08.375 --> 00:37:10.375
That happened over 15 years ago.

399
00:37:10.458 --> 00:37:11.750
So what?

400
00:37:12.625 --> 00:37:15.625
How could he know our names
and where to find us?

401
00:37:15.708 --> 00:37:18.083
It wouldn’t be so hard.
Our father is famous.

402
00:37:18.167 --> 00:37:19.792
His face is all over the place.

403
00:37:20.375 --> 00:37:21.875
It wasn't our fault.

404
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.958
Right. It wasn't our fault.

405
00:37:24.042 --> 00:37:26.250
That’s why we kept it
a secret our entire lives.

406
00:37:26.708 --> 00:37:31.167
I kept it a secret.
You told Mom and who knows who else.

407
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.792
No one.

408
00:37:34.042 --> 00:37:36.375
Get that out of your head.
We did nothing wrong.

409
00:37:36.458 --> 00:37:38.875
We did exactly as Dad said
to the letter. to the T.

410
00:37:38.958 --> 00:37:40.583
He said. "You mustn't tell a soul."

411
00:37:40.667 --> 00:37:44.125
“Don’t ruin your entire life
over a worthless kid.”

412
00:37:44.875 --> 00:37:48.333
Well. look at the results
of his wonderful parenting.

413
00:37:48.417 --> 00:37:50.458
Everyone wants to kill us.

414
00:37:50.542 --> 00:37:52.625
No. seriously. I can't thank Dad enough.

415
00:38:04.625 --> 00:38:05.792
Do you have service?

416
00:38:07.083 --> 00:38:10.208
No service. We're on our own.

417
00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:19.458
Says who? Look over there.

418
00:38:32.417 --> 00:38:33.542
Dear Lord.

419
00:38:55.542 --> 00:38:56.792
Good day.

420
00:39:07.625 --> 00:39:09.583
-Hello.
-Hello.

421
00:39:09.667 --> 00:39:12.583
Thank God we found you good people.
We haven’t seen a soul all day.

422
00:39:12.708 --> 00:39:14.125
How can we help you?

423
00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.333
Please. you have to help us.
We’ve been driving all day

424
00:39:16.417 --> 00:39:18.250
with some lunatic on our tail
trying to kill us.

425
00:39:25.667 --> 00:39:27.375
Hunger and dehydration
got the best of you?

426
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.667
-Please. do you have a phone we can use?
-Absolutely.

427
00:39:30.833 --> 00:39:32.583
Please. tell me you have service.

428
00:39:34.375 --> 00:39:35.875
Let's see how lucky you are.

429
00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:40.667
-Hey. watch out for my gigabytes. though.
-No worries. man. Just let me use it.

430
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.167
Man.

431
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:44.208
Look at that thing move.

432
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:51.458
It’s a matter of life and death.
Give us the phone.

433
00:39:51.583 --> 00:39:53.167
Is that him?

434
00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:55.083
-Please. the phone.
-Just give us the phone.

435
00:39:55.167 --> 00:39:56.458
Give us the phone!

436
00:40:14.542 --> 00:40:15.667
The phone. Nasser.

437
00:40:24.292 --> 00:40:25.875
The phone. the phone!

438
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:31.708
Can you do it?

439
00:40:32.667 --> 00:40:35.625
I can get it. take me to it.

440
00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:48.458
Maryam!

441
00:41:22.042 --> 00:41:23.875
Damn. that burns.

442
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:35.042
-Who are you calling?
-The police.

443
00:41:37.333 --> 00:41:40.583
Please. my brother and I are in danger.
Someone's chasing after us.

444
00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:42.458
He's been chasing us all the way from…

445
00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:44.750
I'm telling you.
yes. someone is chasing us.

446
00:41:44.833 --> 00:41:47.833
He’s been after us
from the start. ramming us.

447
00:41:47.917 --> 00:41:49.250
Just listen to me.

448
00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:54.958
We're out of Riyadh. heading to Abu Dhabi.
We're on the highway…

449
00:41:55.042 --> 00:41:57.958
No landmark whatsoever. no.
We're in the middle of the desert.

450
00:41:59.875 --> 00:42:02.750
A huge white Jeep. its color is white.

451
00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:04.667
-It has lights on top…
-Maryam.

452
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:07.375
-It's very unique. unlike any other Jeep.
-Maryam. give it to me.

453
00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:09.542
-Please. listen.
-Give me that. Dad will call them.

454
00:42:10.542 --> 00:42:12.500
The battery's almost out
and we're still at square one.

455
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.625
For God's sake. answer me.

456
00:42:17.708 --> 00:42:22.042
<i>-Hello? Who is this?</i>
-Hello? Hello?

457
00:42:22.792 --> 00:42:26.792
<i>-Hello? Who is it?</i>
-Hello? Dad. it's me Nasser. Hello.

458
00:42:27.375 --> 00:42:28.958
<i>Nasser. my boy.</i>

459
00:42:30.042 --> 00:42:33.167
Dad. can you hear me?
I have to tell you something.

460
00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:37.625
There's this guy chasing us
since we left Riyadh. He's some madman.

461
00:42:37.708 --> 00:42:42.167
<i>Hello. Nasser. if you can hear me</i>
<i>and want to talk about the lawyer thing…</i>

462
00:42:43.458 --> 00:42:45.708
Hello? Hello?

463
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.250
I swear to you that we've been set up.

464
00:43:00.375 --> 00:43:01.833
I swear to you.

465
00:43:01.917 --> 00:43:03.958
I swear. How else would he know
we're on the road

466
00:43:04.042 --> 00:43:06.333
when we're supposed to be on a plane?

467
00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:09.583
Let me see that number that called you.
The booking office.

468
00:43:09.667 --> 00:43:11.042
What are you doing?

469
00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.375
You think he's the one
who called this morning?

470
00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:26.083
Hold on. You think he told me
the flight was cancelled?

471
00:43:52.458 --> 00:43:53.833
What do you want?

472
00:43:55.583 --> 00:43:56.917
What do you want?

473
00:43:58.292 --> 00:44:00.708
What have we done to you
to deserve all this?

474
00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:07.542
Is it money that you want?
Do you want any money?

475
00:44:08.417 --> 00:44:09.750
Don't tell him that.

476
00:44:13.208 --> 00:44:14.542
Do you want money?

477
00:44:34.125 --> 00:44:35.667
We're going to die out here.

478
00:44:37.458 --> 00:44:39.000
We're going to die out here.

479
00:44:44.208 --> 00:44:46.625
Maryam. calm down.

480
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:49.250
Calm down. please. just stay calm.

481
00:45:18.375 --> 00:45:19.792
We could use my charger on that.

482
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:23.708
Do you think you could get into the trunk
through the back seat?

483
00:45:25.417 --> 00:45:27.125
The charger's in my suitcase.

484
00:45:30.542 --> 00:45:32.250
Let me give it a shot. I'll try.

485
00:46:20.792 --> 00:46:22.958
-Nasser. hit the brakes.
-Are you serious?

486
00:46:23.083 --> 00:46:24.458
Just hit the brakes. Nasser!

487
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:49.833
-Please tell me that you have it.
-I do.

488
00:47:42.167 --> 00:47:46.583
<i>Hi. Maryam.</i>
<i>Sorry I missed your call. I was asleep.</i>

489
00:47:49.875 --> 00:47:52.708
<i>I'm doing much better today.</i>

490
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.792
<i>The chemo drains the soul out of me.</i>
<i>but I'm feeling a bit better today.</i>

491
00:47:59.458 --> 00:48:01.208
<i>I had a dream about you two.</i>

492
00:48:02.167 --> 00:48:03.792
<i>You and Nasser.</i>

493
00:48:03.875 --> 00:48:07.083
<i>you were playing in the garden</i>
<i>with the kitten that we got you.</i>

494
00:48:08.292 --> 00:48:11.542
<i>Do remember her name?</i>
<i>What was it? Cucumber. was it?</i>

495
00:48:12.208 --> 00:48:13.667
<i>Or maybe Plum?</i>

496
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:14.875
Pumpkin.

497
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.375
<i>I forgot. the dream wasn’t clear.</i>

498
00:48:18.625 --> 00:48:22.333
<i>You two were playing and happy.</i>

499
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.833
<i>I pray you’re always this happy.</i>

500
00:48:26.667 --> 00:48:30.000
<i>Tell Nasser I forgive him…</i>

501
00:48:31.083 --> 00:48:32.083
<i>for…</i>

502
00:48:33.083 --> 00:48:34.792
<i>for not wanting to see me here.</i>

503
00:48:36.208 --> 00:48:38.833
<i>Your brother can't take</i>
<i>seeing me like this.</i>

504
00:48:40.833 --> 00:48:43.125
<i>He’s too much like his father.</i>

505
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:47.292
<i>Take care of yourself. my darling.</i>

506
00:48:47.375 --> 00:48:52.125
<i>I hope you stay well.</i>
<i>Take care. Mommy's little girl. take care.</i>

507
00:49:06.708 --> 00:49:08.375
I have all her voice notes.

508
00:49:11.417 --> 00:49:13.750
Sometimes I just want to hear her.

509
00:49:17.458 --> 00:49:18.917
Maryam…

510
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.917
I'm sorry.

511
00:49:22.667 --> 00:49:26.000
I’m sorry we don’t see each other more.

512
00:49:28.417 --> 00:49:31.292
Believe me.
I always try to find time. but…

513
00:49:32.542 --> 00:49:34.250
It's really difficult for me.

514
00:49:35.708 --> 00:49:36.958
Why?

515
00:49:39.333 --> 00:49:41.583
Maryam. you look so much like Mom.

516
00:49:46.667 --> 00:49:49.375
Mom wanted you
to be yourself and nothing more.

517
00:49:50.875 --> 00:49:52.792
And that’s all I want to see as well.

518
00:49:53.458 --> 00:49:54.583
I just want to see Nasser.

519
00:49:56.625 --> 00:50:00.625
I want you to forget all the pressure
to be like anyone but yourself.

520
00:50:12.083 --> 00:50:15.458
Why don't you grab us something
to eat from the bag? I'm getting hungry.

521
00:50:15.542 --> 00:50:17.208
What did you get us?

522
00:50:17.333 --> 00:50:19.708
By the way. there's a surprise
for you in the back.

523
00:50:19.833 --> 00:50:23.750
No way. I can't believe my eyes.
How did you find these things?

524
00:50:24.417 --> 00:50:26.917
Do they still sell these? No way.

525
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.667
When we were little
you used to adore them.

526
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:32.458
Remember when you got
one of them stuck up your nose?

527
00:50:37.583 --> 00:50:40.708
-When are you going to make me an aunt?
-What?

528
00:50:40.792 --> 00:50:42.833
Not before you make me an uncle.

529
00:50:42.917 --> 00:50:44.958
You know I’m not getting married
before you.

530
00:50:46.375 --> 00:50:49.375
Well. I'm not in a hurry at all
when it comes to that. seriously.

531
00:50:49.458 --> 00:50:52.292
Remember when we were kids.
how you were so…

532
00:50:52.375 --> 00:50:56.208
eager about growing up. having a family.
and raising your own kids?

533
00:50:57.792 --> 00:51:01.167
Nasser. do you remember
how tense things were at home?

534
00:51:03.833 --> 00:51:06.917
You know. Mom was never happy.
even before she got sick.

535
00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:10.458
That scares me.

536
00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:14.333
It really scares me.
I don’t want to recreate her experience.

537
00:51:19.292 --> 00:51:21.042
May you rest in peace. Mom.

538
00:51:36.417 --> 00:51:37.542
Maryam.

539
00:51:37.667 --> 00:51:39.000
What?

540
00:51:41.125 --> 00:51:42.875
Am I seeing things again?

541
00:51:44.583 --> 00:51:46.583
Maryam. I'm hallucinating. right?

542
00:51:48.042 --> 00:51:49.667
I'm hallucinating.

543
00:51:50.708 --> 00:51:52.375
This isn’t real.

544
00:51:52.458 --> 00:51:55.292
Just calm down. okay?

545
00:51:56.708 --> 00:51:58.417
I am calm. Maryam.

546
00:51:59.083 --> 00:52:00.792
Damn. it's itching. It's itching me.

547
00:52:00.875 --> 00:52:03.875
Don't move. stay as you are.

548
00:52:06.542 --> 00:52:07.750
What are you doing?

549
00:52:07.833 --> 00:52:09.208
Thinking. damn it.

550
00:52:09.333 --> 00:52:11.875
Thinking about what I'll do
with a scorpion on my brother's foot!

551
00:52:17.917 --> 00:52:20.583
What do you think you're doing?
Don't move. don't move.

552
00:52:20.667 --> 00:52:23.292
-Okay. just calm down.
-Leave it. just leave it. please.

553
00:52:23.375 --> 00:52:24.875
Leave it and don't do anything.

554
00:52:27.833 --> 00:52:29.792
What are you doing. Maryam? Don't do that.

555
00:52:31.417 --> 00:52:33.083
-Maryam.
-Are you ready?

556
00:52:33.167 --> 00:52:35.417
-Hell no. I'm not.
-I have to remove it.

557
00:52:40.125 --> 00:52:42.333
I'm not ready. stay put.

558
00:52:42.417 --> 00:52:45.667
-Get back. get back to your seat now.
-Don't you move.

559
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:47.833
-Now. No.
-Just don't move.

560
00:52:47.917 --> 00:52:49.083
No!

561
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:03.917
Dear Lord. Thank God.

562
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.500
How did this thing get in here?

563
00:53:06.167 --> 00:53:08.167
That bastard left
no stone unturned. did he?

564
00:53:11.083 --> 00:53:12.708
No. no.

565
00:53:12.792 --> 00:53:16.167
-No. no. What are you doing with it? No!
-I'm killing it.

566
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:18.667
Leave it. It's a living creature.

567
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:21.042
A living creature.
And what am I. the leg of a table?

568
00:54:03.458 --> 00:54:05.750
A patrol car.
Maryam. there's a patrol car.

569
00:54:16.042 --> 00:54:17.542
THE ARAB PLATFORM

570
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:36.417
-Hello.
-Hello. how can I help you?

571
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.958
We’ve been on the road for hours.
We’re driving from Riyadh.

572
00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:41.792
And there’s a crazy man
who’s been stalking us the whole way.

573
00:54:41.875 --> 00:54:45.208
We were heading to Abu Dhabi for a wedding
and this guy's been trying to kill us.

574
00:54:45.292 --> 00:54:47.750
He's got a white Jeep.
he's been on our tail. ramming into us.

575
00:54:47.833 --> 00:54:49.625
He even stole our shoes. His shoes…

576
00:54:49.708 --> 00:54:51.500
-He stole my shoes.
-Whoa. hold it.

577
00:54:51.583 --> 00:54:54.792
So. you're heading to Abu Dhabi
all the way from Riyadh for a wedding…

578
00:54:54.875 --> 00:54:56.542
-Yes.
-…looking like this?

579
00:54:56.667 --> 00:55:00.708
Also. there's a guy trying to kill you.
and he stole your shoes?

580
00:55:08.333 --> 00:55:10.042
Fine. why does he want to kill you?

581
00:55:17.167 --> 00:55:20.542
Sir. when we were just kids.
this is 15 years ago.

582
00:55:20.833 --> 00:55:23.125
and I mean.
we were just children.

583
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.958
we were in a resort in Jeddah.
we were playing with this toy air gun.

584
00:55:27.667 --> 00:55:31.208
It's just a BB gun.
it wasn't supposed to harm anyone.

585
00:55:32.042 --> 00:55:33.167
And…

586
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.917
there was this kid
passing under our balcony.

587
00:55:39.208 --> 00:55:42.333
I hit him in the eye and blinded him.

588
00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:47.625
So. this kid’s been planning his revenge
for all these years?

589
00:55:47.917 --> 00:55:50.125
The guy chasing you.
was he missing an eye?

590
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.833
We couldn’t see. he’s wearing sunglasses.

591
00:55:52.917 --> 00:55:55.917
But. Officer. it doesn't necessarily
have to be him who wants to kill us.

592
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.625
It could be someone else.

593
00:55:58.167 --> 00:55:59.500
How many people want to kill you?

594
00:56:01.083 --> 00:56:03.625
-How are you related?
-She's my sister.

595
00:56:06.167 --> 00:56:09.292
Fine. seems to me that you two
are suffering from heat stroke.

596
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.417
That's absolutely natural. it happens.

597
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.750
Heat. thirst. and hunger are only natural.

598
00:56:13.833 --> 00:56:15.625
Trust me. some weird stuff
happens out here.

599
00:56:15.708 --> 00:56:17.458
I mean. a while ago.

600
00:56:17.542 --> 00:56:20.667
a guy said he was arguing with a hedgehog
about who won the World Cup.

601
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:22.292
Does this look like a heat stroke to you?

602
00:56:24.625 --> 00:56:26.750
-Where did you get that?
-I told you. he ran me over.

603
00:56:26.833 --> 00:56:28.667
I talked to him. and he almost killed me.

604
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:30.042
What about the back bumper?

605
00:56:30.167 --> 00:56:33.500
He’s been ramming us the whole way.
the car is a wreck.

606
00:56:33.667 --> 00:56:35.417
Okay. Calm down. Keep calm.

607
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.000
Give me your IDs
and let me report this to Operations.

608
00:56:38.083 --> 00:56:40.292
Then we’ll get an ambulance
and get you checked out.

609
00:56:40.375 --> 00:56:42.000
and we'll meet up at the last stop.

610
00:56:42.458 --> 00:56:43.667
Your IDs. please.

611
00:56:46.542 --> 00:56:47.542
Thank you.

612
00:56:47.625 --> 00:56:50.958
-As you wish.
-Wait for me here. Just for a minute.

613
00:57:01.417 --> 00:57:03.167
Operations. do you copy?

614
00:57:04.542 --> 00:57:05.750
<i>Go ahead.</i>

615
00:57:06.625 --> 00:57:10.083
I'd like to inquire about two persons.
Two Saudi citizens…

616
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:19.625
-Nasser.
-Yeah.

617
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:21.500
Why did his expression change?

618
00:57:24.542 --> 00:57:26.167
Freeze. both of you.

619
00:57:26.375 --> 00:57:28.917
Freeze. listen to me
and follow my instructions

620
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.250
so you don’t get into more trouble
than you’re already in.

621
00:57:31.375 --> 00:57:32.417
What's wrong?

622
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:34.792
Come closer and put both hands
on the hood right now.

623
00:57:34.875 --> 00:57:37.208
I won't say it twice.
Freeze. both of you. Come here.

624
00:57:37.292 --> 00:57:40.458
Place both hands on the hood
and keep your mouth shut.

625
00:57:41.125 --> 00:57:43.458
-Place your hands here as well. Freeze.
-All right. but why?

626
00:57:43.542 --> 00:57:45.417
We'll freeze. we will.

627
00:57:45.792 --> 00:57:47.792
-Spread your legs.
-Just explain what's going on.

628
00:57:47.875 --> 00:57:51.333
We got a call at the station
about a car just like yours.

629
00:57:51.417 --> 00:57:54.583
Stolen by a brother and sister
heading for the border.

630
00:57:54.917 --> 00:57:56.167
You don’t believe us?

631
00:57:56.375 --> 00:57:58.583
This isn’t just theft. it’s smuggling.

632
00:57:58.667 --> 00:57:59.833
This doesn't make sense.

633
00:57:59.917 --> 00:58:03.292
It must be the Jeep guy.
the bastard's framing us.

634
00:58:03.458 --> 00:58:07.292
-The one-eyed man?
-You believe that monster. but not us.

635
00:58:07.375 --> 00:58:10.458
I called the police myself.
you can call and make sure.

636
00:58:10.542 --> 00:58:14.083
You'll find all the information you need.
Now. Call them now.

637
00:58:14.167 --> 00:58:17.708
If you both made a report.
then one of you must be lying.

638
00:58:17.792 --> 00:58:19.250
It's either you or him.

639
00:58:19.333 --> 00:58:22.083
Stay still. and listen to my instructions.
You hear me?

640
00:58:32.667 --> 00:58:36.292
And here comes your white Jeep.
Let’s all have a nice calm chat together.

641
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.375
-He's a dangerous man. Listen to me!
-Please. please.

642
00:58:40.458 --> 00:58:43.625
-I'm more dangerous! Stay put. you two!
-Please. please.

643
00:58:43.708 --> 00:58:46.375
You need a pair of handcuffs.

644
00:58:46.458 --> 00:58:48.417
You move too much. stay put.

645
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:51.083
-I’m telling you he’s dangerous.
-Don’t move.

646
00:58:52.167 --> 00:58:53.792
You asked for it.

647
00:58:55.417 --> 00:58:56.667
God. no.

648
00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:59.083
-Please. listen to me.
-Don't move.

649
00:58:59.167 --> 00:59:02.208
-I beg you to listen to me.
-If you move. I'll put you in the car.

650
00:59:02.292 --> 00:59:03.625
-Okay?
-Okay.

651
00:59:44.375 --> 00:59:45.500
Get up.

652
00:59:46.375 --> 00:59:48.625
Lean on me. You're okay.

653
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.708
You're going to trust me now. huh?
Look at me.

654
00:59:52.583 --> 00:59:54.667
Maryam. Maryam. come here!

655
00:59:56.417 --> 00:59:58.250
-Maryam. he's coming at you!
-Move it!

656
01:00:02.583 --> 01:00:03.500
The keys.

657
01:00:13.792 --> 01:00:16.042
Maryam. Maryam. there's no time for this!

658
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.292
He's here. he's coming!
He's here. he's here!

659
01:00:19.417 --> 01:00:20.875
There's no time. Get them and hurry.

660
01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:27.292
Maryam. he’s here!
He’s here! There’s no time! Run!

661
01:00:53.833 --> 01:00:55.042
Nasser!

662
01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:31.583
Maryam. I shot him
and I think I killed him.

663
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:34.167
That's good. but you scared me!

664
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:36.083
You scared me. for the love of God!

665
01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.458
Shit!

666
01:02:22.667 --> 01:02:24.583
Maryam. stay steady
so I can shoot his tires.

667
01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:26.750
I’ll slow down.

668
01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:17.667
What are you doing? Why did you stop?

669
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:19.750
The cop. We can't just
leave him behind like that.

670
01:03:19.917 --> 01:03:22.708
The cop died in your arms. Maryam.
Drive on. he's dead.

671
01:03:22.792 --> 01:03:26.292
I didn’t check his pulse.
I didn’t. How can you be sure?

672
01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:30.958
He split his head open.
his brains are on the road. just go.

673
01:03:31.042 --> 01:03:35.500
If you were him. you'd wish for anyone
to have the courage to help you!

674
01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:37.500
Maryam. do you live in a fantasy or what?

675
01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:40.458
Snap out of it. for heavens' sake!
Focus. this is all real!

676
01:03:40.542 --> 01:03:43.083
If he changes his tire.
he could be upon us at any moment.

677
01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:44.875
You get out of this car and you’re dead!

678
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.333
I was about to die!

679
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.542
I was about to!

680
01:03:50.333 --> 01:03:52.500
But that man saved my life.

681
01:04:00.167 --> 01:04:02.042
Get away! Get off me!

682
01:04:02.125 --> 01:04:04.667
-Let me drive. are you crazy? Stop it!
-Just get away from me!

683
01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:06.083
I hate how selfish you are!

684
01:04:06.167 --> 01:04:08.083
Your arrogance! Get away!

685
01:04:08.167 --> 01:04:10.375
I hate how stubborn
and hardheaded you are!

686
01:04:11.292 --> 01:04:13.458
You think you're always right.

687
01:04:13.542 --> 01:04:18.083
We are all here to grant your wishes.
follow your opinions. your beliefs.

688
01:04:18.167 --> 01:04:20.458
and we're all here
to cater to your needs! All of us!

689
01:04:20.542 --> 01:04:22.375
No one is ever right but you?

690
01:04:24.083 --> 01:04:26.542
But it's not your fault.
it's your father's fault!

691
01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:29.583
He was my father when I was born.

692
01:04:29.667 --> 01:04:32.583
I never had a choice in that.

693
01:04:33.542 --> 01:04:36.583
Yet all you do is remind me
of this shit every single day.

694
01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:39.583
Well. who do you think I am?
What about me?

695
01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:41.250
And what about me?

696
01:04:42.292 --> 01:04:44.042
I built myself from scratch.

697
01:04:44.125 --> 01:04:48.083
I never asked either of you
for a single damn thing.

698
01:04:48.208 --> 01:04:50.875
Everyone at the hospital
needs me and trusts me.

699
01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:52.792
from doctors to patients to janitors.

700
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.667
And where are you?

701
01:05:12.833 --> 01:05:14.208
My family?

702
01:05:14.833 --> 01:05:16.917
Or am I not part of this family?

703
01:05:24.917 --> 01:05:27.750
All I ever wanted is to be seen.

704
01:05:27.875 --> 01:05:30.417
And all I’ve ever wanted is to disappear.

705
01:05:38.958 --> 01:05:41.000
We don't have a single bullet left.

706
01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:44.542
And that psycho
could change his tire any minute.

707
01:05:46.708 --> 01:05:51.667
Maryam. I know how you feel.
but you can't save everyone.

708
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:22.708
<i>It doesn't matter who is chasing us.</i>
<i>It could be any of them.</i>

709
01:06:23.458 --> 01:06:26.750
<i>Or even someone else entirely.</i>

710
01:06:26.833 --> 01:06:30.042
<i>It’s all because of Dad’s</i>
<i>injustice and corruption.</i>

711
01:06:30.125 --> 01:06:32.000
<i>He never saw other people as even human.</i>

712
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:35.792
<i>And we’re paying the price for his sins.</i>

713
01:06:39.417 --> 01:06:41.750
Let’s just get
the hell out of this desert.

714
01:07:15.208 --> 01:07:16.500
Maryam. watch out!

715
01:10:00.167 --> 01:10:02.292
Dear God. help us.

716
01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.833
Nasser. Nasser!

717
01:11:50.625 --> 01:11:53.542
It’s been fun spending time with you.

718
01:11:55.333 --> 01:11:58.917
You too. Let’s do it again. Soon.

719
01:12:25.625 --> 01:12:27.667
<i>Such a long road</i>

720
01:12:28.792 --> 01:12:31.417
<i>And the desert seems unending</i>

721
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.917
<i>Home seems to be weeping in sadness</i>

722
01:12:34.125 --> 01:12:36.708
<i>For visitors that no longer come around</i>

723
01:12:36.792 --> 01:12:39.042
<i>Such a long road</i>

724
01:12:39.458 --> 01:12:42.542
<i>And the deserts seem unending</i>

725
01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:44.958
<i>Home seems to be weeping in sadness</i>

726
01:12:45.042 --> 01:12:47.375
<i>For visitors that no longer come around</i>

727
01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:50.000
<i>The night's getting darker</i>

728
01:12:50.208 --> 01:12:53.708
<i>Yet our wishes have so little time</i>

729
01:12:53.792 --> 01:12:59.042
<i>Hey. you. with the eyes</i>
<i>That never sleep. help me out here</i>

730
01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:02.167
<i>Such a long road</i>

731
01:13:09.625 --> 01:13:12.042
<i>Such a long road</i>

732
01:13:12.708 --> 01:13:15.458
<i>And the deserts seem unending</i>

733
01:13:15.542 --> 01:13:17.375
<i>And the home is weeping in sadness</i>

734
01:13:19.042 --> 01:13:22.042
They're more than an hour late.

735
01:13:23.042 --> 01:13:25.792
Their phones are all off.

736
01:13:27.083 --> 01:13:28.083
I know. I know.

737
01:13:28.208 --> 01:13:31.833
It's because of Adnan's stupid driving.
I know how to teach him a lesson.

738
01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.000
Where do I find them now
and how do I look for them?

739
01:13:37.375 --> 01:13:38.875
I'll wait for ten more minutes.

740
01:13:38.958 --> 01:13:42.250
If they're not here.
I'll start without them.

741
01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:10.375
Congratulations.

742
01:14:12.417 --> 01:14:14.125
You might want to consider a divorce.

743
01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:16.792
Or he’ll ruin your life.

744
01:14:21.667 --> 01:14:23.833
I quit.
