My favorite. I love it.

I used to take my daughters camping too.

00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:55.574
Tandy: Stop!

14
00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:11.048

Are you going to say yes?

16
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.844
Tandy: |'|| say yes if it's big.

17
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.563
Conwell: I may have to make you wait
if you don't promise to say yes.

00:02:45.708 --> 00:02:48.878
If it's big. like big big.

25
00:02:49.378 --> 00:02:50.379
Conwell: Ready?

26
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.465
Tandy: It's so big!

27
00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:53.883
- Told you.
- You did.

28
00:02:56.886 --> 00:02:58.012
What do you say?

29
00:02:58.095 --> 00:02:59.347
I say yes.

30
00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:13.486
Tandy: Help me!

31
00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:26.619
Missy: How was the ocean?

32
00:05:27.036 --> 00:05:29.914
- Reese: Wavy.
- Missy: Wavy isn't a word. dear.

33
00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:31.624
Reese: Wavy is totally a word.

34
00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:34.084
Missy: This is my new favorite beer.

35
00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:36.188
Every beer is your new favorite beer.

36
00:05:36.212 --> 00:05:38.506
I am so excited Audra is coming home.

37
00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:39.840
Do you think she'll stay?

38
00:05:39.924 --> 00:05:40.925
No. most likely not.

39
00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:43.802
But it would be so good
having her home for a while.

40
00:05:43.886 --> 00:05:45.971
- Yeah. it will be.
- The real question is.

41
00:05:46.055 --> 00:05:48.909
what's Haley going to think of her
little sister coming back to west craven?

42
00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:50.893
It's so sad that they hate each other.

43
00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:52.978
Yeah. well.
it's a hate of mutual tolerance.

44
00:05:53.062 --> 00:05:54.742
so I'm sure everything's going to be fine.

45
00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.166
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

46
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.775
With those two?

47
00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.485
Who knows?

48
00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:04.323
Devon: Spin around.

49
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.283
How about lover boy over there?

50
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:10.496
How do you think
he feels that Audra's back?

51
00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:13.791
Probably not great. but I don't think
they've spoken since she left.

52
00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:14.875
Yikes.

53
00:06:15.251 --> 00:06:16.252
Devon: Hey.

54
00:06:16.335 --> 00:06:17.938
Now blow me a kiss.

55
00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:22.591
Okay. I'll talk to him.

56
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.532
I don't think we're supposed
to have bottles on the beach.

57
00:06:28.556 --> 00:06:31.684
Not yet. Also not a nude beach. either.
But who's counting?

58
00:06:31.767 --> 00:06:34.270
Every time we come here.
somebody has to get topless.

59
00:06:34.353 --> 00:06:35.479
Come on.

60
00:06:35.563 --> 00:06:36.730

Let's grab you a beer.

118
00:09:30.696 --> 00:09:32.156
- Yes.
- Hey!

119
00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:34.658
- And a top of some sort?
- I'll be right back. babe.

120
00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:35.868
Missy: Maybe shorts too.

121
00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:37.202
You guys ruin everything.

122
00:09:37.286 --> 00:09:38.996
Yeah. right. Come on.

123
00:09:40.706 --> 00:09:42.583
Devon: Fine. I could use a beer anyway.

124
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.467
You need to get over it.

125
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.427
I told her what would happen
if she came back.

126
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.596
What. Devon?
What is going to happen?

127
00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:57.389
You don't understand where she left it.

128
00:09:57.473 --> 00:09:59.057
No. I think I understand pretty well.

129
00:09:59.141 --> 00:10:00.476
Yeah. you think you do.

130
00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:02.978
Regardless of what happened.
you got what you deserved.

131
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:05.773
- Whatever.
- You know. you were a real dick. Devon.

132
00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:08.192
Oh. so Audra just gets total absolution.

133
00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:10.027
Uh. yeah. pretty much.

134
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.487
Okay. even still.

135
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.490
I can't just abide by the fact
that she bought the tupp house.

136
00:10:14.573 --> 00:10:15.908
Okay? That can't stand.

137
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:16.992
Why not?

138
00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.369
Because I'm a tupp after all.

139
00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:20.913
You are not a tupp.

140
00:10:20.996 --> 00:10:23.832
- My third cousin married into...
- Never married a tupp.

141
00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:25.417
You are no kind of tupp.

142
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:28.670
Damn it. missy. I...
She has to regret coming back here.

143
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.215
No. she doesn't.

144
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:35.302
We'll see.

145
00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:38.138
We'll see nothing.
Besides. why do you even care?

146
00:10:38.222 --> 00:10:40.474
You have a pretty
new girlfriend now. anyway.

147
00:10:41.642 --> 00:10:43.519
- Autumn: Hey. baby.
- Hey. babe.

148
00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:45.354
Let's go!

149
00:10:45.896 --> 00:10:46.897
Giddy up!

150
00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.024
Whoa.

151
00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:51.294
- Reese: How did the talk go?
- Autumn: Oh. my god!

152
00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:53.654
- As expected.
- So. terribly?

153
00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:55.155
Pretty much.

154
00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.262
What's the worst that could happen?

155
00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.746
Yeah. keep saying that.

156
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:03.831
Come on.

157
00:11:03.914 --> 00:11:05.558
Reese: At least you have
a new favorite beer.

158
00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.222
Missy: Yeah. well. at least there's that.

159
00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:08.794
Reese: Shotgun!

160
00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:30.691
What's with these homies
who be dissin' my boy?

161
00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:31.942
Do they know?

162
00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:36.446
I'm aggravated with the negativity
and the noise

163
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:41.159
they tell me "find a wealthy man"

164
00:11:41.243 --> 00:11:45.122
but they don't seem too happy

165
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:50.168
I was afraid to put myself
on the line for a boy...

166
00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:51.795
Amazing.

167
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.172
Oh. boy. Oh. boy.

168
00:12:05.726 --> 00:12:07.895
And that's enough from you.

169
00:12:14.026 --> 00:12:15.027
Key.

170
00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.047
The rest of you can wait.

171
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.388
And you...

172
00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:45.265
I forgot about you.

173
00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:47.893
What do I do with you?

174
00:12:49.645 --> 00:12:51.146
A place to do acid. I suppose.

175
00:12:52.606 --> 00:12:55.150
Or tear you down
and put in a hot tub.

176
00:13:05.077 --> 00:13:06.244
Bingo.

177
00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:08.538
Bingo.

178
00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:27.849
And you are all mine.

179
00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:29.703
I should call daddy.

180
00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.736
Conwell: Hello.
You've reached conwell's voicemail.

181
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.927
Please leave a message.

182
00:14:46.011 --> 00:14:47.804
Unless it's one of you kids
who needs money.

183
00:14:47.888 --> 00:14:49.389
In that case. call your mother.

184
00:14:49.765 --> 00:14:52.934
She likes to hear from you guys once
in a while when you don't need money.

185
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.145
And aften/vards. call gramps too.

186
00:14:56.313 --> 00:15:00.233
Anyways. I just arrived.
and it's amazing.

187
00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.319
I can never thank you enough.

188
00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:05.280
I can't believe they let us
keep all the furniture.

189
00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:09.076
I'm having the girls over later.
so I'll see you tomorrow.

190
00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:10.702
Love you.

191
00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:16.750
Today is a great day.

192
00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:18.418
Oh. shit!

193
00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:20.587
I'm wrecking this place already.

194
00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:35.185
There.

195
00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:36.311
Good as new.

196
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:56.123
Oh. it's so comfortable.

197
00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.795
I never want to get up. Ugh.

198
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.801
Fuck me.

199
00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:17.102
Beautiful.

200
00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:37.789
Hmm.

201
00:16:38.874 --> 00:16:40.667
I need to get my bags from the trunk.

202
00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.212
And take a shower.

203
00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:29.567
Oh. my god.

204
00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:34.739
I don't see how anyone
could go crazy living here.

205
00:18:37.284 --> 00:18:38.618
Maybe in the Dollhouse.

206
00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:26.458
Escalator for Christmas.

207
00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:32.714
I have a dock

208
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.011
I have a dock

209
00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:45.727
And here's the ocean.

210
00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:49.898
Full of big fish with sharp teeth. Yuck!

211
00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:17.777
Why is this door even locked?

212
00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:28.913
Hey. Audra!

213
00:21:28.997 --> 00:21:30.165
- Reese?
- It's missy.

214
00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:33.084
Surprise!

215
00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:34.294
Surprise!

216
00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:37.088
Fuck you. guys.

217
00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:41.301
Say it again. Surprise!

218
00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:43.070
- I'm going to kill you.
- Happy housewarming.

219
00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:44.345
Thanks.

220
00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:46.365
Dude. Audra. were you really going to

221
00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:48.325
bash my brains out with that rock?

222
00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:50.685
Yeah. and I think you would
have deserved it. too.

223
00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:51.936
Disagree.

224
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:53.861
Come on. guys. Up you go.

225
00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:55.607
Missy: We're so much fun.

226
00:21:55.857 --> 00:21:57.609
Audra: Yeah. tons. Tons of fun.

227
00:21:58.276 --> 00:22:01.154
And where did you get this thing?

228
00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:03.461
Don't ask.

229
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:04.574
It's getting hot in there.

230
00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:06.659
It's getting hot in here

231
00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:08.637
So take off all your clothes

232
00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:10.663
I am getting so hot

233
00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:12.957
I wanna take my clothes off

234
00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:15.084
when the rest of your clothes come off.

235
00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:16.294
help me with these bags.

236
00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:19.005
Oh. I think breakfast is shot.

237
00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:21.132
Well. luckily.
I brought the wine in first.

238
00:22:21.216 --> 00:22:22.217
That's my girl.

239
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.219
Yeah. even though
she's a big college grad.

240
00:22:24.302 --> 00:22:26.095
her priorities remain intact.

241
00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:29.766
Actually. you take the bag.

242
00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:32.101
- I'm going to go get the suitcases.
- All right.

243
00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:03.758
I still can't tell if this house
is creepy or quaint.

244
00:23:03.841 --> 00:23:04.884
It's Cape Cod.

245
00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:06.761
Every place is both creepy and quaint.

246
00:23:06.844 --> 00:23:08.304
It's like. part of its charm.

247
00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:12.100
I guess that's why
the pilgrims stayed here.

248
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:16.104
Yeah. or they ran out of gas.

249
00:23:16.187 --> 00:23:17.831
Or they hit a rock. Maybe both.

250
00:23:17.855 --> 00:23:19.295
Something like that.

251
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:24.946
- Fuck!
- Oh. my gosh.

252
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:27.323
- What was that?
- My wine.

253
00:23:27.407 --> 00:23:29.242
Did you just say "gosh"?

254
00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:30.326
Shut up!

255
00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:33.806
We'll handle this.

256
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.224
- Audra: Are you sure?
- Yeah. it's fine.

257
00:23:35.248 --> 00:23:37.959
Okay. I'm gonna go put my bags away
and take a shower.

258
00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:40.020
- Sounds good.
- I'm really glad you guys are here.

259
00:23:40.044 --> 00:23:41.671
- I love you.
- I love you.

260
00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:49.345
Maybe slightly more creepy than quaint.

261
00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:50.471
Slightly.

262
00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:52.557
Especially in this house.

263
00:23:54.309 --> 00:23:55.476
Holy cheeses!

264
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.200
- Let's find big knives.
- Audra: Careful!

265
00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.390
- I don't know if I have any band-aids!
- Huge knives.

266
00:24:00.648 --> 00:24:03.443
Audra: Seriously. ladies!

267
00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:30.094
Missy: Oh. Reese. Why do you
get the room with the fireplace?

268
00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:32.430
Reese: Because you get the room
with the creepy closet.

269
00:24:40.897 --> 00:24:42.482
I should've brought a glass of wine.

270
00:24:42.565 --> 00:24:44.275
Then this would've been perfect.

271
00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:03.920
Reese?

272
00:25:05.672 --> 00:25:06.673
Missy?

273
00:25:08.466 --> 00:25:09.467
Hello?

274
00:25:14.097 --> 00:25:15.890
Hey! Get me a glass of wine!

275
00:25:54.345 --> 00:25:55.346
Reese?

276
00:25:56.305 --> 00:25:57.306
Missy?

277
00:25:58.891 --> 00:25:59.892
Hello?

278
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:04.731
Hello?

279
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.193
Fuck! Ow!

280
00:26:09.277 --> 00:26:10.278
Fuck me!

281
00:26:10.737 --> 00:26:13.281
I just bought a beautiful house.
and now I can't see.

282
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.032
That's not a win-win.

283
00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:09.170
Jesus!

284
00:27:10.671 --> 00:27:12.071
Why do you keep trying to scare me?

285
00:27:12.131 --> 00:27:15.009
Scare you? I came in to see if I could use
the shower after you're done.

286
00:27:15.092 --> 00:27:17.178
and you me asked for a glass of wine.

287
00:27:17.678 --> 00:27:19.597
And you got me a glass of wine?

288
00:27:20.556 --> 00:27:21.599
Yeah.

289
00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:24.977
And I spilled another
glass of wine on my floor.

290
00:27:25.311 --> 00:27:26.312
Yeah.

291
00:27:28.397 --> 00:27:29.398
Thank you.

292
00:27:29.899 --> 00:27:30.900
Missy: Anytime.

293
00:27:32.777 --> 00:27:34.946
It doesn't sound like
you girls are playing nice.

294
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:36.280
I was playing nice.

295
00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:38.783
Careful! There is glass.

296
00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:40.326
Good grief!

297
00:27:40.785 --> 00:27:42.245
Could you toss me that towel?

298
00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:43.329
Reese: Sure.

299
00:27:44.539 --> 00:27:45.540
Audra: Thank you.

300
00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:48.960
If you are so against drinking wine
tonight. why did you buy so much?

301
00:27:49.043 --> 00:27:51.003
I didn't mean to be.
but it's a good thing I did.

302
00:27:51.087 --> 00:27:52.255
Yeah. I'll say.

303
00:27:52.338 --> 00:27:53.658
I'm going to grab my glass before

304
00:27:53.714 --> 00:27:55.692
shambles strikes again.

305
00:27:55.716 --> 00:27:58.261
Why don't you shower upstairs
and I'll help Audra with this?

306
00:27:58.344 --> 00:27:59.345
Righto.

307
00:28:09.564 --> 00:28:11.649
You're superjumpy tonight.
It's not like you.

308
00:28:11.732 --> 00:28:14.944
Well. in all fairness. you guys did try
to give me a heart attack earlier.

309
00:28:15.027 --> 00:28:16.028
True.

310
00:28:16.112 --> 00:28:18.131
Can you go get me some undennear
out of my room. please?

311
00:28:18.155 --> 00:28:19.198
Sure thing.

312
00:28:25.329 --> 00:28:26.497
Audra: Not the cute ones.

313
00:28:33.337 --> 00:28:36.215
You could never

314
00:28:36.716 --> 00:28:40.052
be killed

315
00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:46.183
the feeling was real

316
00:28:46.392 --> 00:28:49.645
and I touch you

317
00:28:49.729 --> 00:28:53.608
with my hand

318
00:28:53.774 --> 00:28:55.651
touch you...

319
00:28:55.818 --> 00:28:56.861
These will do.

320
00:28:58.279 --> 00:28:59.363
Audra: Thank you.

321
00:29:11.626 --> 00:29:13.669
Missy: What kind of radio station is this?

322
00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:19.050
Ugh. Where's the radio. anyway?

323
00:29:36.192 --> 00:29:37.985
I was a-walkin'

324
00:29:39.487 --> 00:29:42.323
in my new black boots

325
00:29:42.907 --> 00:29:45.493
cause darlin' you know

326
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.205
the best trees show their roots

327
00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:50.831
and when I showed up

328
00:29:52.667 --> 00:29:55.836
to that dance hall on 65

329
00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.254
I was a-lookin'...

330
00:29:59.048 --> 00:30:01.676
I wish my parents would
get me a house when I graduated.

331
00:30:02.677 --> 00:30:04.637
Audra: Yeah. my parents bought me
this great place

332
00:30:04.679 --> 00:30:07.682
because they think I'll live here forever
and they'll see me more often.

333
00:30:08.808 --> 00:30:12.061
You know the drill.
Grandbabies. blah. blah. blah

334
00:30:12.478 --> 00:30:13.980
at least that's what my mom thinks.

335
00:30:14.063 --> 00:30:16.357
Basically. exactly like my sister.

336
00:30:16.774 --> 00:30:19.068
- Will it work?
- Not a chance.

337
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:21.529
I'm going back to the real city
after the summer.

338
00:30:22.238 --> 00:30:23.239
So cool.

339
00:30:23.823 --> 00:30:27.702
But I probably will visit more often
now that this is my own place.

340
00:30:27.785 --> 00:30:30.579
I can't wait till you move to New York
so I can come visit you there.

341
00:30:31.455 --> 00:30:33.082
You should move to New York.

342
00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:34.625
Maybe.

343
00:30:34.917 --> 00:30:36.836
I still can't believe
you got this house.

344
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.672
Why? I've always loved this house.

345
00:30:39.797 --> 00:30:43.134
But it's the tupp house.
The motherfucking tupp house.

346
00:30:43.217 --> 00:30:44.343
Enough of that.

347
00:30:44.427 --> 00:30:45.678
Fuck the tupps.

348
00:30:45.928 --> 00:30:47.054
It's my house now.

349
00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.562
No more

350
00:30:54.937 --> 00:30:57.523
turns across the floor

351
00:30:57.773 --> 00:30:59.275
but then it's your turn

352
00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:01.235
boy. you better learn

353
00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:02.611
to be a gentleman

354
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.073
to be a gentleman

355
00:31:12.747 --> 00:31:16.125
Babe. the tupps were mad
and people died here.

356
00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:17.728
And what about the ones that vanished?

357
00:31:17.752 --> 00:31:19.420
Lord knows what happened to them.

358
00:31:20.546 --> 00:31:23.883
So you're saying this place is haunted
just because some crazy family

359
00:31:23.966 --> 00:31:26.218
lived here years ago
and some of them died here?

360
00:31:26.886 --> 00:31:30.222
Uh. yeah. basically. I would say
that's what makes it haunted.

361
00:31:36.395 --> 00:31:40.191
Don't want your religion. no

362
00:31:40.274 --> 00:31:43.110
I got problems of my own

363
00:31:43.194 --> 00:31:47.073
don't want your misgivings. no

364
00:31:47.156 --> 00:31:53.079
you gotta be suave cause you know...

365
00:31:53.329 --> 00:31:54.497
Audra: Whatever.

366
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.124
All the tupps are dead and gone
or othennise vanished.

367
00:31:57.208 --> 00:31:58.375
And it's my place now.

368
00:31:58.667 --> 00:32:01.712
Daddy paid in full cash
well below market value

369
00:32:01.796 --> 00:32:04.673
because. apparently.
people think like you do

370
00:32:04.757 --> 00:32:06.717
and nobody wants it but me

371
00:32:06.801 --> 00:32:10.221
and I'm never. ever selling it.

372
00:32:12.515 --> 00:32:13.766
Well. okay. then.

373
00:32:13.849 --> 00:32:16.977
Because I love it. It's big and pretty.

374
00:32:17.061 --> 00:32:19.980
And I have a beach and a dock
and a boathouse.

375
00:32:20.606 --> 00:32:22.233
That boathouse is a death trap.

376
00:32:23.192 --> 00:32:24.276
Audra: Maybe so.

377
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.363
That's okay because I don't want
or need a boat because

378
00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:29.406
I hate the water.

379
00:32:30.074 --> 00:32:31.325
But you love the beach.

380
00:32:31.408 --> 00:32:32.910
Love the beach. hate the water

381
00:32:32.993 --> 00:32:35.579
'cause I don't like those
fish with big teeth.

382
00:32:35.663 --> 00:32:36.747
You mean sharks?

383
00:32:36.831 --> 00:32:38.833
Those are the ones.

384
00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:40.626
All right.

385
00:32:46.841 --> 00:32:48.425
I'm going to go get more wine.

386
00:32:48.551 --> 00:32:50.386
Are you actually going
to finish it this time?

387
00:32:50.469 --> 00:32:52.388
You know what? I can give it a go.

388
00:32:52.805 --> 00:32:53.973
What about the bathroom?

389
00:32:54.306 --> 00:32:55.307
Leave it.

390
00:32:55.516 --> 00:32:56.642
I'll pick it up later.

391
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:00.855
- Audra: Come on.
- Reese: Okay. fine.

392
00:33:08.404 --> 00:33:10.656
Grab something
to slice the cheese with. please.

393
00:33:13.784 --> 00:33:14.785
Perfect.

394
00:33:16.704 --> 00:33:19.415
Reese: I have to tell you.
the idea of spending the night

395
00:33:19.498 --> 00:33:21.750
in the tupp house creeps me out.

396
00:33:21.834 --> 00:33:23.627
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

397
00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:26.088
Okay. so I went to the zoo the other day.

398
00:33:26.172 --> 00:33:27.173
Yeah?

399
00:33:27.256 --> 00:33:30.509
And there was only one dog.
and it was a shih tzu.

400
00:33:35.264 --> 00:33:37.016
Oh. my god. That's stupid.

401
00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:39.059
I know. It's cheesy. right?

402
00:33:39.268 --> 00:33:40.769
Audra: Cheesy? Get it?

403
00:33:40.853 --> 00:33:42.521
Get it?

404
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:45.065
I know. we're comedians.

405
00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.410
Reese: Missy! Get down here!
The movie's starting!

406
00:33:56.785 --> 00:33:58.704
All right! Just a minute!

407
00:34:00.623 --> 00:34:03.250
This is all I wanted to do all day.

408
00:34:03.918 --> 00:34:04.919
Amen to that.

409
00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:09.048
Although this movie is probably
going to give me nightmares.

410
00:34:09.131 --> 00:34:11.217
Mmm. It'll be worth it.

411
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.301
If you say so.

412
00:34:15.596 --> 00:34:17.765
Reese:
Get down here! The movie is starting!

413
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.726
Missy: I'm coming!

414
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.020
Not that I want to watch the movie.

415
00:34:27.024 --> 00:34:28.859
I might have to crawl into
bed with you later.

416
00:34:30.152 --> 00:34:31.195
Reese: Missy!

417
00:34:31.278 --> 00:34:32.279
Missy: I'm coming!

418
00:34:33.322 --> 00:34:35.908
Oh. man. This movie again?

419
00:34:35.991 --> 00:34:37.451
I hate scary movies.

420
00:34:37.534 --> 00:34:39.119
Come on. missy. don't be such a pussy.

421
00:34:39.328 --> 00:34:41.622
I'm sorry that I don't like
stupid horror movies

422
00:34:41.705 --> 00:34:45.542
with stupid naked chicks running around.
getting chased by chainsaws or whatever.

423
00:34:45.626 --> 00:34:46.686
Some people love them.

424
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:48.396
Then I guess that's why
they still make them.

425
00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.005
- Audra: Mm-hmm.
- I like them

426
00:34:50.089 --> 00:34:51.882
even though they give me the willies.

427
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:58.722
Shit. I wish someone was here
to give me the Willy.

428
00:34:58.806 --> 00:35:00.057
But it's a girls' night.

429
00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.725
Just pour a glass and sit down.

430
00:35:02.268 --> 00:35:04.770
Way ahead of you. dear.

431
00:35:05.271 --> 00:35:07.147
Try not to spill any on the floor. huh?

432
00:35:07.231 --> 00:35:08.565
That was not my fault.

433
00:35:08.649 --> 00:35:10.192
Always making a mess.

434
00:35:10.276 --> 00:35:11.670
All right. well. I'm going to bed.

435
00:35:11.694 --> 00:35:13.279
Um. big day of drinking tomorrow.

436
00:35:13.612 --> 00:35:15.281
- Boo.
- Boo nothing.

437
00:35:15.364 --> 00:35:17.908
I love you guys and
I'm really glad you're home. Audra.

438
00:35:17.992 --> 00:35:18.993
Love you. babe.

439
00:35:22.955 --> 00:35:24.498
Reese: Don't look in the closet!

440
00:35:24.581 --> 00:35:26.500
Missy: Don't light yourself on fire!

441
00:35:26.792 --> 00:35:27.960
Reese: No promises!

442
00:35:28.377 --> 00:35:29.503
It's chilly in here.

443
00:36:11.295 --> 00:36:12.463
Really has a nice view.

444
00:36:18.302 --> 00:36:19.595
Too bad it's haunted.

445
00:36:41.617 --> 00:36:42.910
Don't look in the closet.

446
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.455
You'll just encourage...

447
00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:48.082
W... whatever.

448
00:37:18.112 --> 00:37:19.279
Don't do it.

449
00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:34.253
Fuck.

450
00:37:41.969 --> 00:37:45.055
Missy: Of course the woods behind
the tupp house are terrifying.

451
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.742
Just close your eyes and
have sweet dreams.

452
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:48.660
Holy Christ!

453
00:38:48.744 --> 00:38:50.579
Wow.

454
00:38:51.538 --> 00:38:53.123
- Anyone important?
- No.

455
00:38:57.961 --> 00:38:59.296
Are you done with the cheese?

456
00:38:59.421 --> 00:39:00.881
Yeah. I think I've had enough.

457
00:39:01.215 --> 00:39:02.508
I'll take the knife. too.

458
00:39:03.383 --> 00:39:04.801
Carry on.

459
00:39:11.433 --> 00:39:12.809
I think I'll hit it. too.

460
00:39:14.019 --> 00:39:15.312
Babe. really?

461
00:39:15.395 --> 00:39:17.832
I'm beat and I think I've had enough
excitement for one night.

462
00:39:17.856 --> 00:39:20.692
Are you sure?
We're about to get to the good part.

463
00:39:20.776 --> 00:39:23.987
Yeah. if I see any more good parts.
I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight.

464
00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:25.656
Okay. I'll go to bed soon too.

465
00:39:25.739 --> 00:39:26.740
No. you won't.

466
00:39:26.823 --> 00:39:28.367
Night. Sleep tight.

467
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.620
- Don't let the bed bugs...
- Don't say bedbugs.

468
00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:33.747
There better not be any bedbugs in there.

469
00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:35.332
Uh. no bugs.

470
00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:36.917
Good.

471
00:39:37.459 --> 00:39:38.460
The rats ate them.

472
00:39:38.919 --> 00:39:40.712
I'll die. I'll iiterallyjust die.

473
00:39:41.213 --> 00:39:42.214
Good night.

474
00:39:42.548 --> 00:39:43.549
Good night.

475
00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:45.875
Reese: I hope everything is locked.

476
00:40:08.907 --> 00:40:10.409
No rats. no bugs.

477
00:40:15.122 --> 00:40:17.040
At least I don't have to sleep upstairs.

478
00:40:34.891 --> 00:40:36.143
And magic.

479
00:40:38.854 --> 00:40:41.106
It's getting hot in here

480
00:40:41.189 --> 00:40:43.650
so take off all your clothes

481
00:41:41.792 --> 00:41:44.461
Haunted or not.
at least the fire makes it cozy.

482
00:44:11.149 --> 00:44:13.693
Just a normal unhaunted cape house.

483
00:45:33.648 --> 00:45:36.484
Johnny on TV: From behind
the tree. and grandpa got all excited.

484
00:45:36.568 --> 00:45:39.696
and he shook his fist at me and said.
"boy. you'll be damned to hell!"

485
00:45:39.779 --> 00:45:42.240
Remember that? Right over there.

486
00:45:43.533 --> 00:45:45.410
Boy. you used to really be scared here.

487
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:47.662
Barbra on TV: Johnny!

488
00:45:48.121 --> 00:45:49.623
Johnny: Hey. you're still afraid!

489
00:45:49.998 --> 00:45:51.583
Barbra: Stop it. now! I mean it!

490
00:45:56.588 --> 00:45:58.465
Johnny: I'm coming to get you. Barbra!

491
00:45:59.424 --> 00:46:01.593
Barbra: Stop it! You're ignorant!

492
00:46:01.676 --> 00:46:03.678
Johnny: They're coming for you. Barbra!

493
00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:06.932
Barbra: Stop it!
You're acting like a child!

494
00:46:07.223 --> 00:46:08.463
Johnny: They're coming for you!

495
00:46:09.517 --> 00:46:11.561
Johnny: Look. there comes one of them now!

496
00:46:18.276 --> 00:46:20.612
You. you belong on the ground!

497
00:46:21.529 --> 00:46:23.365
Now stay on the ground!

498
00:46:32.165 --> 00:46:34.000
- Christ! Fuck!
- Hey.

499
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:38.380
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Yes. I'm fine.

500
00:46:38.463 --> 00:46:39.714
Are you sure you're okay?

501
00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:42.092
Audra: Yes. it's just the wind.

502
00:46:45.345 --> 00:46:46.429
Go back to bed.

503
00:46:48.264 --> 00:46:50.141
- Reese: Good night.
- Good night.

504
00:46:50.225 --> 00:46:51.385
Reese: Please lock the doors.

505
00:47:15.291 --> 00:47:16.626
Here's to you. grammy.

506
00:47:44.571 --> 00:47:45.572
Whoo!

507
00:47:45.655 --> 00:47:46.781
That worked fast.

508
00:48:18.354 --> 00:48:19.355
Hello?

509
00:49:17.956 --> 00:49:19.124
Hey. stop that.

510
00:49:57.871 --> 00:49:58.872
Couldn't sleep?

511
00:49:59.164 --> 00:50:02.292
No. your fucking dog woke me up.
It licked my feet.

512
00:50:03.001 --> 00:50:04.419
I don't have a dog.

513
00:50:06.212 --> 00:50:07.255
What do you mean?

514
00:50:07.338 --> 00:50:08.756
I mean. I don't have a dog.

515
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.050
You've been here all night.
Did you see a dog?

516
00:50:11.634 --> 00:50:13.303
I don't know. It's a big house.

517
00:50:13.553 --> 00:50:14.679
That pug thing?

518
00:50:15.013 --> 00:50:16.556
- Wookie?
- Yeah. wookie.

519
00:50:16.639 --> 00:50:17.932
That's my dad's dog.

520
00:50:18.016 --> 00:50:20.810
He's sort of cute
but I wouldn't let him in here.

521
00:50:20.894 --> 00:50:22.145
Think of the carpets.

522
00:50:22.562 --> 00:50:23.813
Are you fucking with me?

523
00:50:25.023 --> 00:50:26.274
No. I'm not.

524
00:50:27.609 --> 00:50:29.903
Audra. if you don't have a dog...

525
00:50:30.904 --> 00:50:32.780
Then something licked my feet.

526
00:50:37.702 --> 00:50:38.703
Let's go.

527
00:50:52.675 --> 00:50:54.260
See? No dog.

528
00:50:54.761 --> 00:50:58.014
Contrary to what you may think.
that doesn't make me feel any better.

529
00:51:06.105 --> 00:51:07.106
Audra.

530
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:21.454
Reese: I really don't like this.

531
00:51:29.087 --> 00:51:30.880
Reese: These knives are sharp. right?

532
00:51:48.398 --> 00:51:49.732
No dog over here.

533
00:51:51.818 --> 00:51:53.695
Something licked my feet.

534
00:51:53.778 --> 00:51:55.613
And no dog over here.

535
00:51:56.281 --> 00:51:59.325
I repeat. Something licked my feet.

536
00:52:00.285 --> 00:52:02.996
Hmm. Maybe...

537
00:52:03.162 --> 00:52:06.582
It was a big. scary...

538
00:52:06.666 --> 00:52:08.710
Do not say rat.

539
00:52:10.044 --> 00:52:12.630
- Get down.
- Isn't there a song about monkeys

540
00:52:12.714 --> 00:52:14.632
jumping on the bed with butcher knives?

541
00:52:14.716 --> 00:52:16.509
You had a strange childhood.

542
00:52:16.592 --> 00:52:17.593
Come on.

543
00:52:21.848 --> 00:52:23.349
Three little monkeys

544
00:52:23.433 --> 00:52:24.809
jumping on the bed

545
00:52:24.892 --> 00:52:25.935
not with knives.

546
00:52:27.562 --> 00:52:29.397
What's wrong? What are you guys doing?

547
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.773
She was jumping on the bed.

548
00:52:30.857 --> 00:52:33.609
And she thinks a dog
was licking her feet in her sleep.

549
00:52:33.693 --> 00:52:34.986
And there's no dog.

550
00:52:35.903 --> 00:52:37.697
Okay. well. thanks for stopping by.

551
00:52:39.824 --> 00:52:41.242
Let's go.

552
00:52:41.326 --> 00:52:42.535
Can't we search her room?

553
00:52:42.618 --> 00:52:44.746
Audra: No. Let the poor girl sleep.
Come on.

554
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:46.122
Fine.

555
00:52:52.795 --> 00:52:54.672
Not that I'm getting much sleep.

556
00:53:28.122 --> 00:53:29.582
Something did lick my feet.

557
00:53:29.707 --> 00:53:31.918
Maybe it was just a bad dream.

558
00:53:32.001 --> 00:53:34.837
Or maybe it was a good dream. huh?
How long was the tongue?

559
00:53:35.338 --> 00:53:36.547
I'm calling the cops.

560
00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:38.174
Really?

561
00:53:38.257 --> 00:53:39.360
What are you gonna tell them?

562
00:53:39.384 --> 00:53:41.677
I don't have a dog.
They're gonna laugh at you.

563
00:53:41.928 --> 00:53:44.222
As long as they bring guns.
they can laugh.

564
00:53:44.555 --> 00:53:46.140
I'm gonna laugh at you.

565
00:53:51.145 --> 00:53:52.230
Reese: It's not here!

566
00:53:53.022 --> 00:53:54.482
What's not there?

567
00:53:54.816 --> 00:53:56.234
The imaginary dog?

568
00:53:56.317 --> 00:53:58.444
Why don't you Google "imaginary"?

569
00:53:58.528 --> 00:54:00.196
Hell. why don't you Google "dog"?

570
00:54:00.279 --> 00:54:01.906
Reese: No. my phone.

571
00:54:01.989 --> 00:54:03.116
My phone is gone.

572
00:54:03.199 --> 00:54:04.784
Your phone is not gone.

573
00:54:04.867 --> 00:54:07.412
- It's nowhere.
- Your phone is not nowhere.

574
00:54:07.495 --> 00:54:09.163
- Call it.
- Is that a dare?

575
00:54:09.247 --> 00:54:10.248
Just call it.

576
00:54:10.331 --> 00:54:12.708
Audra: Okay. I'll call it.
But when we find it.

577
00:54:12.792 --> 00:54:15.336
you have to promise me
you'll Google "imaginary dog".

578
00:54:15.545 --> 00:54:16.546
Deal.

579
00:54:23.469 --> 00:54:24.804
Man on TV: Do you live here?

580
00:54:39.986 --> 00:54:40.987
Funny.

581
00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:42.113
Reese: What?

582
00:54:45.283 --> 00:54:48.119
Audra: I could've sworn
I put my phone in my purse.

583
00:54:50.371 --> 00:54:51.414
See?

584
00:54:51.539 --> 00:54:53.583
See what? I'll find it.

585
00:54:53.666 --> 00:54:54.834
They took our phones.

586
00:54:54.917 --> 00:54:57.628
Audra: Like. took them how?
Who? When? Where? Why?

587
00:54:57.712 --> 00:54:59.964
I don't know. Maybe upstairs or before.

588
00:55:00.465 --> 00:55:03.134
Even dogs don't take phones. Reese.

589
00:55:03.301 --> 00:55:05.636
You're right. Audra.
Dogs don't take phones.

590
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:14.896
Reese: I really don't like this place.

591
00:55:14.979 --> 00:55:16.814
Audra: What the fuck?

592
00:55:17.398 --> 00:55:18.524
Reese: Oh. my god!

593
00:55:18.983 --> 00:55:21.611
Any chance you do have a dog
that you forgot about?

594
00:55:22.904 --> 00:55:25.573
I mean. I hope so.
but those aren't paw prints.

595
00:55:25.656 --> 00:55:26.699
Reese: What are they?

596
00:55:28.159 --> 00:55:29.243
Hoof prints?

597
00:55:29.327 --> 00:55:30.578
Like the devil?

598
00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:33.706
The devil's got to have better things
to do than this. I mean...

599
00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:35.291
Wars and shit.

600
00:55:36.083 --> 00:55:38.103
Reese: I don't know.
I mean. if they're not paw prints

601
00:55:38.127 --> 00:55:39.962
or devil hoof prints. what are they?

602
00:55:46.552 --> 00:55:48.763
There's only one good
goddamn way to find out.

603
00:55:48.846 --> 00:55:50.014
I knew you'd say that.

604
00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:02.318
Reese: Ouch!

605
00:56:09.617 --> 00:56:11.827
Reese: Goats? You have goats?

606
00:56:12.203 --> 00:56:14.580
No. Obviously someone's fucking with us.

607
00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:16.499
Goat fuckers.

608
00:56:16.582 --> 00:56:18.167
He's kind of cute. though. right?

609
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:21.921
Yeah. right. Why don't you
have him lick your feet?

610
00:56:22.004 --> 00:56:23.756
Reese: Help me up.

611
00:56:24.048 --> 00:56:25.883
Up we go.

612
00:56:28.052 --> 00:56:29.887
So much for my cute undennear.

613
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:32.515
Reese: Stupid goat.

614
00:57:09.176 --> 00:57:10.177
Audra!

615
00:57:12.096 --> 00:57:15.016
- Reese: I'm not going near that goat.
- Audra: Just open the door for it.

616
00:57:15.057 --> 00:57:16.183
He already licked your feet.

617
00:57:16.267 --> 00:57:17.327
Reese: You're the one with a knife.

618
00:57:17.351 --> 00:57:20.271
So you want me to kill the goat?

619
00:57:29.572 --> 00:57:31.657
Audra: Shit! Ow!

620
00:57:32.116 --> 00:57:34.243
Reese: Help me! Help me up!
Don't leave me!

621
00:57:34.327 --> 00:57:35.911
Audra: Reese! Reese! Reese!

622
00:57:35.995 --> 00:57:37.955
Come on! Come on! Oh. my god!

623
00:57:50.801 --> 00:57:51.862
Reese: Audra!

624
00:57:51.886 --> 00:57:54.096
Oh. my god. What are we gonna do? Careful!

625
00:57:55.264 --> 00:57:56.724
Reese!

626
00:57:56.807 --> 00:57:58.267
But we have to just run.

627
00:57:58.601 --> 00:58:00.144
Missy! What about missy?

628
00:58:00.436 --> 00:58:02.938
- We can't leave her.
- What the fuck are we gonna do?

629
00:58:03.272 --> 00:58:05.816
- My keys! My keys are in my purse.
- You can't go in there.

630
00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.109
Hold on.

631
00:58:09.195 --> 00:58:10.446
- Audra: Missy!
- Reese: Missy!

632
00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:13.783
Missy!

633
00:58:19.622 --> 00:58:21.040
She can't still be sleeping.

634
00:58:21.123 --> 00:58:22.750
Maybe... maybe she's hiding.

635
00:58:29.465 --> 00:58:31.801
- Oh. is that him?
- Reese: I think so. Who else?

636
00:58:31.884 --> 00:58:33.886
I don't know.
There could be more than one.

637
00:58:36.514 --> 00:58:37.682
Missy: Help me!

638
00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:42.937
- I'm going in.
- No!

639
00:58:43.437 --> 00:58:45.856
- Yes. I'm going in to get missy.
- Don't leave me.

640
00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:48.025
I'm gonna in and get missy and our keys.

641
00:58:49.193 --> 00:58:51.237
- Reese: Please don't leave me.
- Listen.

642
00:58:51.362 --> 00:58:53.614
- Count to 180.
- What?

643
00:58:54.115 --> 00:58:55.324
Three minutes. I'll be fast.

644
00:58:55.408 --> 00:58:58.327
If I'm not back by the time
you get done counting. then run.

645
00:58:58.411 --> 00:59:02.081
Run down the middle of the street and
don't stop for anyone or anything. okay?

646
00:59:02.957 --> 00:59:04.125
Please don't go.

647
00:59:05.376 --> 00:59:06.460
I have to go.

648
00:59:06.544 --> 00:59:07.586
He's gone now.

649
00:59:12.758 --> 00:59:13.884
Please don't go.

650
00:59:14.385 --> 00:59:15.386
Audra!

651
00:59:19.682 --> 00:59:20.683
You can do this.

652
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.104
Reese: Please be fast.

653
00:59:28.482 --> 00:59:30.443
Audra: Missy!

654
00:59:43.748 --> 00:59:45.082
101.

655
00:59:46.208 --> 00:59:47.293
Come on. Audra!

656
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.754
Audra: Missy? Missy!

657
00:59:51.505 --> 00:59:52.965
Missy! Wake up!

658
00:59:53.048 --> 00:59:55.885
Missy! Wake up! Missy!

659
00:59:55.968 --> 00:59:57.011
Come on. We gotta go.

660
00:59:57.261 --> 00:59:58.262
Missy.

661
01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:23.245
Missy!

662
01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:27.875
199. 200.

663
01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:30.503
Oh. my god!

664
01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:32.004
201.

665
01:00:32.213 --> 01:00:33.631
200 and... fuck!

666
01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:38.719
Oh. my god!

667
01:01:14.255 --> 01:01:15.714
Fuck! Fuck me!

668
01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.220
What's going on?

669
01:01:21.679 --> 01:01:22.930
Why are there goats?

670
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.015
Shoo! Go away. goat!

671
01:01:26.058 --> 01:01:27.518
Oh. my god.

672
01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:31.647
Reese: Oh.

673
01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.821
Shit!

674
01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:42.366
Why is my phone in here?

675
01:02:29.288 --> 01:02:30.789
Reese: No!

676
01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:34.668
Please!

677
01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:51.086
Who are you?

678
01:08:53.547 --> 01:08:54.715
Audra: Who are you?

679
01:08:56.967 --> 01:08:59.136
Who the fuck are you?

680
01:09:02.973 --> 01:09:03.974
You know what?

681
01:09:04.891 --> 01:09:06.184
I don't care!

682
01:10:37.692 --> 01:10:40.028
Woman: I can't believe this happened.
Any of it.

683
01:10:41.196 --> 01:10:43.281
Can you believe the fucking nerve of him?

684
01:10:43.448 --> 01:10:45.033
I really can't.

685
01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:48.495
I know. It takes a special
kind of asshole to ask for a divorce

686
01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:51.456
at the hospital where
your dad just fucking died.

687
01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:55.460
He really asked for the divorce
right after your dad. you know...

688
01:10:55.544 --> 01:10:57.544
I mean. honestly. it was
after they pulled the plug

689
01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:59.714
so technically dead.
but he wasn't even cold.

690
01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:01.675
Spoken to Audra yet?

691
01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:03.051
No.

692
01:11:03.718 --> 01:11:05.530
I don't even think she knows yet.
I've been trying to get

693
01:11:05.554 --> 01:11:07.490
- a hold of her all night.
- Did Brett give you any...

694
01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:09.391
I don't know. indication?

695
01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:12.853
Uh. oh. you mean besides
the fucking tramps he's been nailing

696
01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:15.522
- at the golf course?
- What a piece of shit.

697
01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:18.024
Yeah. Can you at least
keep him from your money?

698
01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:20.318
No. We don't have a prenup and...

699
01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:23.947
Daddy's worth a fortune.
He probably thinks he's just going to...

700
01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:26.241
He's going to cash in on half.

701
01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:27.993
That fucking bastard!

702
01:11:28.076 --> 01:11:29.786
I've never liked him.

703
01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:32.080
Oh. my god.

704
01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:36.585
God bless daddy's soul.
I mean. he spent all of his money

705
01:11:36.668 --> 01:11:38.628
on tramps at the golf course.

706
01:11:39.004 --> 01:11:41.756
Over my dead body will I watch it
get spent that way again.

707
01:11:41.882 --> 01:11:43.734
You're really going over
to the tupp house? Now?

708
01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:45.135
Yeah. I'm here. I gotta go.

709
01:11:45.427 --> 01:11:46.803
Be strong. Haley.

710
01:11:54.478 --> 01:11:56.813
I should literally kill him.

711
01:11:56.897 --> 01:11:59.691
I should chop him up into 406 pieces.

712
01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:03.069
box him. bow him and bestow him
to his fucking mother.

713
01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:09.534
Just breathe. Haley. Just breathe.

714
01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:13.246
Do not fall apart at the seams. Not now.

715
01:12:14.039 --> 01:12:15.040
Fuck!

716
01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:34.476
Holy fuck! Pick up!

717
01:12:38.939 --> 01:12:40.190

01:12:49.407 --> 01:12:50.408
Audra?

719
01:12:50.784 --> 01:12:52.160
Audra: Hey. this is Audra.

720
01:12:52.244 --> 01:12:56.456

721
01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:35.829
Oh. my god!

722
01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:40.834
Audra: Hey. this is Audra.

723
01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:45.046
I don't check messages regularly.
but leave a message. Bye.

724
01:14:22.751 --> 01:14:23.752
Fuck!

725
01:14:34.763 --> 01:14:35.764
Audra?

726
01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:09.566
Haley: Fuck you!

727
01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:42.390
- Brett?
- You bitch!

728
01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:49.397
Brett: I killed your dad. bitch.

729
01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:54.486
Brett: Die!

730
01:16:57.238 --> 01:16:59.365
Die! Die! Just fucking die!

731
01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:13.421
Just die.

732
01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:29.813
Audra?

733
01:17:31.105 --> 01:17:32.190
Haley?

734
01:17:37.445 --> 01:17:39.030
Is this your piece of shit husband?

735
01:17:39.113 --> 01:17:40.365
Yes. it is.

736
01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:44.744
I never liked him.

737
01:17:45.203 --> 01:17:46.371
Well. I did.

738
01:17:47.205 --> 01:17:48.706
You're not wearing your wedding ring.

739
01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:51.835
Yeah. well. he killed daddy.

740
01:17:57.632 --> 01:17:59.717
Okay. Okay!

741
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:02.262
Hey. he's going to fucking die!

742
01:18:02.637 --> 01:18:05.014
Audra. he's going to fucking die.

743
01:18:05.974 --> 01:18:06.975
Yeah.

744
01:18:07.058 --> 01:18:08.893
Yeah. so. let him bleed out in peace.

745
01:18:10.228 --> 01:18:12.897
He killed daddy and you want him
to bleed out in peace?

746
01:18:12.981 --> 01:18:13.982
Really?

747
01:18:15.692 --> 01:18:17.235
How about bleed out in pieces?

748
01:18:17.569 --> 01:18:19.821
Yeah! Bleed out in pieces. asshole!

749
01:18:22.866 --> 01:18:24.242
You bitch!

750
01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:56.107
Haley.

751
01:18:57.609 --> 01:18:59.944
Haley.

752
01:19:03.615 --> 01:19:06.701
Haley.

753
01:19:47.867 --> 01:19:49.202
Audra: You're such a bitch.

754
01:19:58.962 --> 01:20:02.548
Haley is not going to be
a happy camper when she wakes up.

755
01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:12.266
Nope. She'll be super pissed.

756
01:20:34.789 --> 01:20:37.250
- We lost all the goats.
- Not all the goats.

757
01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:40.628
- The cute one.
- Cute? They're super scary.

758
01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:43.423
Are you kidding me?
They look like evil devil monkeys

759
01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:46.092
with these black dead eyes.

760
01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:48.015
I think they're pretty cute.

761
01:20:49.053 --> 01:20:51.556
I bet Audra was so freaked out.

762
01:20:51.639 --> 01:20:53.099
You think about your ex a lot.

763
01:20:53.391 --> 01:20:56.936
I just wish I could've seen the look
on her face whenever she saw the goat.

764
01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:59.397
Yeah. Yeah. we got her pretty good.

765
01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.315
- Yeah.
- Let's go find the cute goat.

766
01:21:01.399 --> 01:21:03.151
Hey. devil monkeys.

767
01:21:03.234 --> 01:21:04.277
Hey. hey.

768
01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:10.450
Autumn: The sun is almost up.

769
01:21:11.576 --> 01:21:13.536
I hope we find him soon.

770
01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:34.390
Devon: There he is.

771
01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:40.438
Shit!

772
01:21:43.357 --> 01:21:45.401
- He's gone.
- He was the cute one.

773
01:21:46.194 --> 01:21:47.695
Autumn: We'll never get him now.

774
01:21:49.072 --> 01:21:50.073
Devon: I'm sorry.

775
01:21:53.117 --> 01:21:54.285
But I do know

776
01:21:54.368 --> 01:21:56.204
- how to make you feel better.
- What?

777
01:21:56.287 --> 01:21:58.456
- A quick skinny dip.
- Nice try.

778
01:21:58.581 --> 01:22:00.583
I think I've been
naked enough for one day.

779
01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:02.210
Technically. it's a new day.

780
01:22:03.294 --> 01:22:04.462
Catch me if you can!

781
01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:11.219
Whoa. are you trying
to attack me?

782
01:22:12.887 --> 01:22:14.722
- Babe.
- Yeah. babe?

783
01:22:15.139 --> 01:22:16.140
Look.

784
01:22:22.522 --> 01:22:24.690
Is that... blood?

785
01:22:30.321 --> 01:22:31.697
Babe. don't.

786
01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:34.117
Devon: I just want to take a look.

787
01:22:39.247 --> 01:22:40.248
Stay right here.

788
01:22:40.331 --> 01:22:41.457
- Stay right here.
- Okay.

789
01:22:48.422 --> 01:22:50.007
- What the fuck?
- Come on. Come on.

790
01:23:14.782 --> 01:23:16.242
- Devon!
- Oh. fuck!

791
01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:17.326
Who was that?

792
01:23:17.827 --> 01:23:19.203
I don't know.

793
01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:20.621
What do we do?

794
01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:22.165
I don't know.

795
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:25.042
- We gotta find Audra. What?
- Enough about your ex!

796
01:23:25.585 --> 01:23:27.670
Shit!

797
01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:32.675
Devon!

798
01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:44.979
Rest in pieces. asshole!

799
01:23:48.065 --> 01:23:49.483
Autumn: Oh. my god!

800
01:23:51.152 --> 01:23:52.153
Fuck!

801
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.282
He was trying to help you!

802
01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:57.909
Do I look like I need help?

803
01:24:14.133 --> 01:24:15.384
Autumn: Oh. my god!

804
01:24:33.361 --> 01:24:34.779
Autumn: Please!

805
01:24:47.458 --> 01:24:50.836
Ghost in my fucking house?
Are you kidding me?

806
01:24:56.676 --> 01:24:58.135
Devon was a real dick.

807
01:24:58.511 --> 01:25:00.596
Autumn: He tried to help you.

808
01:25:34.338 --> 01:25:35.589
Audra: Stupid birds.

809
01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:42.888
What are they so goddamn cheery about?

810
01:26:15.338 --> 01:26:16.339
Reese?

811
01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:29.727
It's okay.

812
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:32.271
I'm here.

813
01:26:37.318 --> 01:26:38.652
I'm so sorry.

814
01:26:43.157 --> 01:26:45.326
This way is better. okay?

815
01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:48.329
It won't hurt anymore.

816
01:26:51.374 --> 01:26:52.375
I love you.

817
01:26:54.001 --> 01:26:55.211
I'm so sorry.

818
01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:58.506
This is better.

819
01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:00.716
This is better.

820
01:27:02.468 --> 01:27:03.636
I'm so sorry.

821
01:28:39.773 --> 01:28:40.858
Audra: In pieces.

822
01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:42.252
Okay. Audra. stop!

823
01:28:42.276 --> 01:28:43.861
Seriously. Stop! He's gonna die!

824
01:28:43.944 --> 01:28:45.571
Just leave it be.

825
01:28:45.988 --> 01:28:48.574
- Die in pieces. asshole!
- You bitch!

826
01:28:50.117 --> 01:28:53.204
Crew member: That's too much.
Sit up. unnaturally.

827
01:28:53.287 --> 01:28:55.289
- Unnaturally? Yeah.
- Yeah.

828
01:28:59.376 --> 01:29:00.669
Woman: Sorry if I hurt you.

829
01:29:00.753 --> 01:29:04.340
I could've sworn...
I put my purse in my bag.

830
01:29:06.884 --> 01:29:09.220
I could've sworn I put my bag in my purse.

831
01:29:09.303 --> 01:29:10.679
What?

832
01:29:23.901 --> 01:29:25.694

833
01:29:25.778 --> 01:29:27.571
I'm calling...

834
01:29:28.239 --> 01:29:29.490
We're going to start over.

835
01:29:42.002 --> 01:29:43.003
Crew member: Come on.

836
01:29:43.087 --> 01:29:44.814
I don't know what's going on.

837
01:29:44.838 --> 01:29:46.173
- Then be like...
- Okay.

838
01:29:46.382 --> 01:29:48.050
- Gotcha.
- Motherlode.

839
01:29:48.133 --> 01:29:50.719
Just be. like. looking for the cheese.

840
01:29:56.433 --> 01:29:58.852
Get in there.

841
01:29:59.812 --> 01:30:00.896
This is the other hand.

842
01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:03.041
- So. while I'm...
- You're good. When you bring it up.

843
01:30:03.065 --> 01:30:05.001
- bring it up so we see you bring it up.
- Just bring it right here.

844
01:30:05.025 --> 01:30:06.503
Crew: So we know that
it's like. a ring. and not your

845
01:30:06.527 --> 01:30:08.612
cock or something.

846
01:30:08.696 --> 01:30:11.907
- I told her what I was going to...
- I hate you.

847
01:30:16.996 --> 01:30:19.623
Okay. you guys. Sorry.
this thing is not staying.

848
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.626
It's not staying in my ass. I guess...

849
01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:23.711
Okay. there.

850
01:30:24.712 --> 01:30:26.839
- I heard that.
- All right.

851
01:30:28.299 --> 01:30:29.466
That's disgusting.

852
01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:31.468
Look...

853
01:30:31.552 --> 01:30:34.555
Look. I have to use
two hands to cover one tit.

854
01:30:37.391 --> 01:30:38.601
One can't cover it.

855
01:30:38.684 --> 01:30:40.811
That's accurate. This is accurate.

856
01:30:40.894 --> 01:30:42.730
Like her head.

857
01:30:42.813 --> 01:30:44.440
It's the size of my...

858
01:30:44.523 --> 01:30:46.317
It's true.

859
01:30:47.067 --> 01:30:48.068
Jesus!

860
01:30:48.694 --> 01:30:50.297
- Crew: Let's do it...
- All right.

861
01:30:50.321 --> 01:30:51.405
Yeah.

862
01:30:55.701 --> 01:30:57.953
Jesus! Why do you keep
trying to scare me?

863
01:30:58.037 --> 01:31:00.164
Scare you? I came into your... sorry.

864
01:31:00.664 --> 01:31:02.499

- Crew: Reset!

Oh. my god.

866
01:31:27.399 --> 01:31:29.026
Sorry. guys.

867
01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:30.778
It's my first time driving a lambo.

868
01:31:32.738 --> 01:31:34.657
Crew: I know. I know.

869
01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:35.741
- Yes.
- Really? No.

870
01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:38.035
- It's my first time.
- Surprise.

871
01:31:40.037 --> 01:31:42.790
- Let's make a movie!
- And... 7. 8. 9. 12.

872
01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:45.000
Reese: Yo mama!

01:34:00.385 --> 01:34:03.222
we got a heart gone cold

900
01:34:04.973 --> 01:34:07.851
we got a heart gone cold

901
01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:12.564
we had a heart of gold

902
01:34:14.107 --> 01:34:16.985
we had our hearts to hold

903
01:34:22.074 --> 01:34:26.328
Are we late for our revival

904
01:34:27.079 --> 01:34:30.707
as we watch the casket close

905
01:34:31.917 --> 01:34:37.005
have we gone to our redemption

906
01:34:37.548 --> 01:34:42.469
as the body leaves the soul

907
01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:47.933
we got a heart gone cold

908
01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:52.563
we got a heart gone cold

909
01:34:54.106 --> 01:34:57.234
we had a heart of gold

910
01:34:58.694 --> 01:35:01.655
we had our hearts to hold

911
01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:06.118
we got a heart gone cold

912
01:35:07.828 --> 01:35:10.747
we got a heart gone cold

913
01:35:12.416 --> 01:35:15.419
we had a heart of gold

914
01:35:17.045 --> 01:35:19.965
we had our hearts to hold
