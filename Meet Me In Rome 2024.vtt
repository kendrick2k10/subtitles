It's been interesting

put career first.
- Yeah.

119
00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.589
In New York. I made history

120

What about you. Christa?

129
00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:21.405
Similarly. I've been working
since I was eight years old.

130
00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.740
and so I've always put career first.

131
00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:25.993
I'm very independent.

132
00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:31.540
and I think now is the time for me
to try to make space...

133
00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:34.001
- Yeah.
- ...for a man to come into my life.

134
00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:35.544

"Oh. these men

135

but maybe I'm not allowing them to.

137
00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:43.468

138
00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:45.554
- Like...
- Whoo.

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:47.556
- Lemonade?
- That would have been cute.

140
00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.935
Um. no. it's-it's actually interesting
that I ended up here.

141

a bunch of different projects.

143
00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:02.070

That's so cute. Yeah.

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:55.040
Let's cheer.
Aye.

173
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.959
All right. guys.
have you ever seen a boat bridge?

174
00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:58.502
No.

175
00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.462
- Yeah. Let's see it.

<i>Andiamo. Andiamo.</i>

177
00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.799
You two go. I will stay here with you.

178
00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:06.134
- Ooh.
- Need to talk.

179
00:07:06.218 --> 00:07:08.136
Need to talk to you?
- Oh. yeah? You want to talk to me?

180
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.222
- Of course.
- Cheers.

181
00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.266

183
00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:18.146
What was your name again?
- You already forgot my name?

184
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.815
Oh. no. Did you for--
did you remember mine?

185
00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:21.024
Of course.

186
00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:22.234
- What is it?
- Dhruva.

187
00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:24.736
- Oh. my God. I feel so guilty.
- Oh. my God. you see?

188
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.905
What was it?
I was too busy staring at you.

189
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.118
Welcome on the bridge.
it's where you drive the boat.

190
00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:33.412
It's where the magic happens.
What do you do?

191
00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.080
I have a company of boats.

192
00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:38.542
I have three boats-- two sailboats
and one motorboat. Like. one speedboat.

193
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:41.128
But that's my-- that's for work.
not for enjoying the life.

194
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:42.838
- Yeah.
- It's different. Two different things.

195
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.549
I did. once from here. I went to Spain.

196
00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.968
- From Italy to Spain?
- From Italy to Spain.

197
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.845
Are you a lover. Lorenzo?

198
00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.388
- Am I a lover?
- Yeah. are you a lover?

199
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.432
What does it mean?
Like. I play with girls?

200
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:54.683
No. I don't.

201
00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:55.767
One second. guys.

202
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:57.311
Hello?
- Oh.

203
00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:58.812

204
00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:01.607
<i>
Oh. Lauren.</i>

205
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.484
<i>We've got to get you to unplug.</i>

206
00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:08.155
How long have you been single?

207
00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:10.616
Now it's. uh. it's four years.

208
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.743
- Four years? Huh.
- Yeah. It's a long time.

209
00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:17.789
'Cause of my job.
I stay so much time away from home.

210
00:08:17.873 --> 00:08:20.083
and that was not that easy.

211
00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:21.293
I want to be present.
- Yeah.

212
00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:23.545
When I think about kids.
I want to spend so much time with them

213
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:26.548
and just not always be working. you know?
- Yeah.

214
00:08:26.632 --> 00:08:29.426
We-- to work. we-we need
to take care about our future.

215
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.179
- Mm-hmm.
- That's the first things.

216
00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:34.723
But of course. you need to take care
about your family.
- Yeah.

217
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:39.228
Oh. you have loads of tattoos.

218
00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:40.729
Don't sh-- d-don't judge me for that.

219
00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.189
- Okay. What does it say?
- YOLO.

220
00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:44.066
"You only live once.
but if you do it right. once is enough."

221
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:46.818
- Don't judge me. I was really young.

222
00:08:46.902 --> 00:08:49.196
- This one's nice. The lighthouse.
- Yeah. this...

223
00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.697
It's a. yeah. Capri lighthouse.

224
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:52.366
Want to see how I will drive the boat?

225
00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:54.993
So come here.

226
00:08:55.077 --> 00:08:56.328
This is where-- how you drive.

227
00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.540
So this is. like. the left propeller.
right propeller.

228
00:08:59.623 --> 00:09:02.042
What if. what if you did. like.
this one forward and this one back?

229
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.669
Is that. like. to turn the boat around?
- It's gonna turn.

230
00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.379
It's called throttle. yes.
It's gonna turn.

231
00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.005
Here. Right here.

232
00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:08.298
From here.

233
00:09:08.382 --> 00:09:11.301
So. when you want to go left.
you go a few times.

234
00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:12.511
Go for it.

235
00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:14.137
And then when you want to go back.

236
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:15.639
perfect.

237
00:09:16.932 --> 00:09:18.433
"Bring me the horizon."

238
00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:21.728

248
00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:57.139

- Oh. my gosh.
- Look at how sexy he looks.

250
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:01.727
He's fine.

251
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.897
- What should I text him?
- You're so giddy. Just keep it simple.

252
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.690
Yeah. "Hey. what's up?"

253
00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.526
That's not me.
- No. say. like. "I had fun yesterday."

254
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.528
Should I say. "Hey. sexy captain"?

255
00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:15.365
- Yeah.
- I wonder what he's gonna say.

256
00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:17.576
It's like a home run for day one.

- It is.
- You just go with the flow.

341
00:13:59.715 --> 00:14:01.175
What about you?

342
00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:03.385
Uh. I've wanted to come to Rome
ever since I saw <i>Gladiator</i>

343
00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:04.803
when I was nine years old.

344
00:14:04.887 --> 00:14:07.431
Really? And it took you
this long to come here?

345
00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:08.599
It took me this long to get here.

346
00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:09.892
Wow. What do you think about it so far?

347
00:14:09.975 --> 00:14:13.645
- I love it. Rome is fun.
- Yeah. So good.

348
00:14:13.729 --> 00:14:16.899
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Cheers to meeting you.

349
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:20.527
So. where are you from?

350
00:14:20.611 --> 00:14:21.987
I'm from Houston. Where are you from?

351
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.656
I live in L.A..
but I'm from Massachusetts.

352
00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.074
Where are your parents from?

353
00:14:26.158 --> 00:14:27.868
Uh. both my parents are from India.

354
00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:29.411
My mom is part-Indian.

355
00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:30.746
- Wait. she is?
- Mm-hmm.

356
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.373
She's actually half-Indian.
half-Vietnamese.

357
00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:35.626
Wow. What about your dad?
What's his background?

358
00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:37.669
My dad is a European mutt.

359
00:14:37.753 --> 00:14:39.129
He's Scottish. Irish. German. and Russian.

360
00:14:39.213 --> 00:14:40.214
Yeah. Oh. my God.

361
00:14:40.297 --> 00:14:42.174
- So. I'm a Skittles bag.
- Yeah. Skittles.

362
00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:46.803
Not me. I'm 100%.

363
00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:48.639
I kind of like that. I'm rare.

364
00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:51.475
- You are rare. How many siblings?
- One.

365
00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:54.770
She's four years younger.
and she just got married last weekend.

366
00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:56.563
I literally came here from her wedding.

367
00:14:56.647 --> 00:14:57.731
- Yeah.

368
00:14:57.814 --> 00:15:01.485
And the wedding was so amazing.
but it's stressful.

369
00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:04.780
There's been a lot of pressure on me
'cause. in the Indian family.

370
00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:08.534
especially my mom and my dad.
being the older sister. and the amount

371
00:15:08.617 --> 00:15:10.661
of people that come up to you being like.

372
00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:13.205
"When are you getting married?"
- Yeah. I already know that.

373
00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:14.456
That's real.
- Yeah.

374
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.793
It's nice to just get away and be like.
"Okay. now I can start my journey."

375
00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:22.840
I feel like I'm in the <i>Lady and the Tramp.</i>

376
00:15:24.383 --> 00:15:25.968
I'm gonna make a big ole mess.
No. just kidding.

377
00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:27.261
We're gonna try that.

378
00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:28.345
Oh. wait.

379
00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.097
are we doing the <i>Lady and the Tramp?</i>
- Yeah.

380
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.224
All right. you're gonna get...
- Ah. I've never done this.

381
00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:33.433
You're gonna get that side.

382
00:15:33.517 --> 00:15:35.894
- Okay. So I got to do this one?
- Yeah.

383
00:15:35.978 --> 00:15:38.230
- Ready?

384
00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:40.566
We're doing this.

385
00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:49.408
Oh. my God.

386
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:51.410
I think I ate most of that pasta.
- I've never done that before.

387
00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:54.413
That was fun.
- Yeah. First kiss.

388

Did you drink that?
- It is so good.

392

You got to try this.

393
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.661
Do it at the same time.

394
00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:36.288
You got to do it with me.

395
00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:43.504
That is so good.
- Wow. that is really good.

396
00:16:43.587 --> 00:16:44.630
You know what they say.

397
00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:46.131
- No.
- Two people drinking

from the same fountain fall in love.

399
00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.676
You haven't heard that one?
- Where did you hear that?

400
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.094
I don't know.
I might've just made it up.

401
00:16:51.178 --> 00:16:53.180
I like it. I like it.

- Yes.

407
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.107

- Manifesting. you know it.

408
00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:06.318

like. all these things
that I wanted to let go of.

410
00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:10.822
and then I burned that in.
like. a little dish with water in it.

411
00:17:10.906 --> 00:17:12.449
And how did it go?

412
00:17:12.533 --> 00:17:14.409
Uh. they're still in my life.

413
00:17:14.493 --> 00:17:16.954

Oh. my God. I love golden doodles.

475
00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:52.025
To say she's my best friend
is an understatement.

476
00:19:52.109 --> 00:19:54.236
Do you have animals?
- Um...

477
00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:55.696
No. I've got a brother.

478
00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:58.448
and. uh. he can act like an animal.

479
00:19:58.532 --> 00:20:01.201
Uh. he's also my best friend.

480
00:20:01.285 --> 00:20:02.953
You know what you have to do
to remember this day?

481
00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:06.874
You're gonna journal about meeting the
tall. dark. handsome man at the fountain.

482
00:20:06.957 --> 00:20:10.627
And you're gonna flatten this
and put this in your journal.

483
00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:13.213
- That's so cute.
- Yeah.

484
00:20:13.297 --> 00:20:15.507
I'll take one. too. so I remember.

485
00:20:15.591 --> 00:20:18.177
What do you say. uh.
we hang out again sometime soon?

486
00:20:26.018 --> 00:20:28.103
Ooh.

487
00:20:28.187 --> 00:20:29.646
- Ready?
- Yeah.

488
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.231
Let's go.

489
00:20:35.319 --> 00:20:39.072
<i>Oh. yeah. Love is definitely
in the air for my leading ladies.</i>

490
00:20:39.156 --> 00:20:42.451
<i>But let's not say arrivederci just yet.</i>

491
00:20:42.534 --> 00:20:45.412
<i>There's still a lot to see
on this Roman holiday.</i>

492
00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:50.167
Watch out.

493
00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:02.012
<i>This has been the best trip.
especially with you guys.</i>

494
00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.972
<i>Yeah.
I know.
I'm so glad I came</i>

495
00:21:04.056 --> 00:21:05.390
'cause my birthday is next week.

496
00:21:05.474 --> 00:21:06.892
We have to do something.

497
00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:09.770
Yeah. it's wild because.
before I got here.

498
00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:13.023
I've been so pressured
by family. friends. and just myself.

499
00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:14.983
I'm turning 35.
- Mm.

500
00:21:15.067 --> 00:21:17.653
But the minute I stepped into Rome.

501
00:21:17.736 --> 00:21:19.571
something changed.

502
00:21:19.655 --> 00:21:21.323
I've let my guard down.

503
00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:23.992
and I feel like. right now.
I'm having fun.

504
00:21:24.076 --> 00:21:26.995
Yeah. I love that the people I've met.

505
00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:28.705
they have no context.

506
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:30.999
no idea. I have no context about them.

507
00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:35.003
And we can just feel each other's energy
and be like. "Do we vibe?"

508
00:21:35.087 --> 00:21:37.756
I would just love to meet someone
who loves me for me.

509
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.842
you know. and makes me a priority.

510
00:21:39.925 --> 00:21:42.469
You feel like your career.
basically. is what

511
00:21:42.553 --> 00:21:44.513
they want you...
Yeah.

512
00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:46.139
I know it's easy to put up walls

513
00:21:46.223 --> 00:21:50.185
because of that past situation.
but dating here in Rome.

514
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:51.895
you kind of have to be a little bit open.

515
00:21:51.979 --> 00:21:53.689
That's true.
Yeah.

516
00:21:53.772 --> 00:21:55.774
Have your rom-com moment.
Live it up in Rome.

517
00:21:55.858 --> 00:21:56.859
Take the pressure off.

518
00:21:56.942 --> 00:21:59.152
Yeah. And I feel like we're all learning.

519
00:21:59.236 --> 00:22:01.905
I mean. I'm grateful to be here in Rome.
and I know sometimes

520
00:22:01.989 --> 00:22:07.244
my head is wrapped up.
but. I think. when it comes to love.

521
00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:08.871
I think it's always been me.

522
00:22:08.954 --> 00:22:10.998
Like. I'm the problem.

523
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:13.750
But I'm the problem
in the sense of I'm just

524
00:22:13.834 --> 00:22:15.961
so focused on my career.
- Mm-hmm.

525
00:22:16.044 --> 00:22:18.922
I'm all about doing it on my own.

526
00:22:19.006 --> 00:22:23.051
And that has. I think.
just always been really tough for me.

527
00:22:23.135 --> 00:22:26.013
Like. a-- Like. really being open
and vulnerable.

528
00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:28.348
letting someone else lead and-and hope...

529
00:22:28.432 --> 00:22:30.642
And trusting them to lead.
Yeah.

530
00:22:30.726 --> 00:22:32.311
It's hard. It can be hard.
Yeah.

531
00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:36.523
All throughout my life.
especially my childhood.

532
00:22:36.607 --> 00:22:39.818
I just have felt. in many situations.
that I've just been really powerless.

533
00:22:39.902 --> 00:22:43.238
And so. it's nice to be in a place

534
00:22:43.322 --> 00:22:44.740
where I feel like I've accomplished.

535
00:22:44.823 --> 00:22:46.825
I'm powerful. I'm doing it.

536
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:48.827
and no one else
can take that away from me.

537
00:22:48.911 --> 00:22:50.871
Yup.
But at some point.

538
00:22:50.954 --> 00:22:53.707
you do the work

539
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.459
and then you realize.

540
00:22:55.542 --> 00:22:57.085
"What have I done all this for

541
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:59.254
if no one is by my side?"
- Mm.

542
00:22:59.338 --> 00:23:02.216
I-I think we're totally
gonna have love in Rome.

543
00:23:02.299 --> 00:23:04.843
No more heartbreaks.
- Yeah. no more heartbreaks.

544
00:23:04.927 --> 00:23:05.886
- Cheers to that.
- Love it.

545
00:23:05.969 --> 00:23:07.888
<i>Good detail.</i>

546
00:23:16.188 --> 00:23:18.607

00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:55.561
This is gonna be fun.

564
00:23:55.644 --> 00:23:57.604

569
00:24:03.986 --> 00:24:05.612
- Got to go left and right.
- Oh.

570
00:24:05.696 --> 00:24:06.864
Oh. okay. you're doing the Italian way?

571
00:24:06.947 --> 00:24:07.865
Gotcha. gotcha.
- Yeah. Of course.

572
00:24:07.948 --> 00:24:08.949

576
00:24:13.662 --> 00:24:15.539

577
00:24:15.622 --> 00:24:17.875

00:24:22.546 --> 00:24:24.006
Bad joke. Okay. okay. okay.
- That was good.

580
00:24:24.089 --> 00:24:25.340
Hi. Christian.
Hi.

581
00:24:25.424 --> 00:24:27.426
- So nice to meet you.
- I'm Dhruva.

582
00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:28.510

00:24:29.678 --> 00:24:32.097
I mean. I want to underplay it. but...

585
00:24:32.181 --> 00:24:35.559
I'm so great at stick figures. so...
Got this.

586
00:24:35.642 --> 00:24:36.852
Welcome to the class today.

587
00:24:36.935 --> 00:24:41.148
We're gonna do
some portrait drawing of each other.

588
00:24:41.231 --> 00:24:44.776
Drawing from life means that
you can observe the other person.

589
00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.196
You can discover who they are

590
00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:50.073
and try to bring it out
in a drawing. then. as well.

591
00:24:54.536 --> 00:24:56.330
I feel like I just need to see...

592
00:24:56.413 --> 00:24:57.915
You want the smolder or just...?

593
00:25:00.209 --> 00:25:02.377
Now I got it.
- You got it? Okay.

594
00:25:02.461 --> 00:25:05.839
I was raised in New York.
then I moved to Puerto Rico.

595
00:25:05.923 --> 00:25:07.841
so I have. like...
- Puerto Rico.

596
00:25:07.925 --> 00:25:09.843
- Puerto Rico. Have you been?
- Look at that spiciness coming out.

597
00:25:09.927 --> 00:25:11.553
Spicy.

598
00:25:11.637 --> 00:25:13.555
- Any pets?
- No pets.

599
00:25:13.639 --> 00:25:14.848
I'm not a huge pet guy.

600
00:25:16.642 --> 00:25:18.393
What do you do for work?
I work in the music industry.

601
00:25:18.477 --> 00:25:20.103

00:25:20.187 --> 00:25:21.271
- You play any instruments?

603
00:25:21.355 --> 00:25:23.148
You know what?
Yeah. I play a little guitar.

604
00:25:23.232 --> 00:25:25.400
- Oh. yeah?
- That's kind of what got me into it.
Yeah. yeah.

605
00:25:25.484 --> 00:25:27.486
- Wait. I need you to play guitar for me.
- So. I can...

606
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:29.696
Oh. looking for the serenade? I got you.

607
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.367
- You might win my heart with that one.
- Oh. boy. I-I could only hope.

608
00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.160
You got a very infectious energy.

609
00:25:36.286 --> 00:25:38.121
How's it going over there?

610
00:25:38.205 --> 00:25:40.791
Draw me like one of your French girls.
- Uh... I-I-I got you.

00:25:40.874 --> 00:25:42.751
Um...

00:25:42.835 --> 00:25:44.920

614
00:25:46.713 --> 00:25:47.756
Oh!

615
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.716
I had no idea.

616
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.385
Like. that's been so long.

617
00:25:52.386 --> 00:25:57.099
- What do you do for work?
- So. I am a civil engineer.

618
00:25:57.182 --> 00:25:59.309
- Yeah?
- So. I work in construction management.

619
00:25:59.393 --> 00:26:00.978

00:26:04.064 --> 00:26:05.065

622
00:26:05.148 --> 00:26:06.650
- Very nice.
- Yeah.

623
00:26:06.733 --> 00:26:10.112
Why does this not actually look like you?

624
00:26:10.195 --> 00:26:12.239
I needed more instruction.
- Yeah.

625
00:26:13.657 --> 00:26:15.659
Okay. I have your eyebrows.
- Damn.

626
00:26:15.742 --> 00:26:19.830
Let me ask you something.
You-you have a lot of. like. energy.

627
00:26:19.913 --> 00:26:21.623
What do you do?
Do you drink a lot of coffee?

628
00:26:21.707 --> 00:26:23.500
-  Oh. my God.
- Do you...

629
00:26:23.584 --> 00:26:25.669
Do you...?
- Wait. do I?

630
00:26:25.752 --> 00:26:28.297
It's a good thing. That's. like.

The age of what? What is my age?

Maybe. Am I? I don't know.

Okay. you don't have to say.

How many siblings do you have?

649
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:09.963
I have two siblings.

650
00:27:10.047 --> 00:27:13.091
Yeah.
- So I would put you in the middle.

651
00:27:13.175 --> 00:27:14.801

So. I'll explain now.

659
00:27:27.689 --> 00:27:30.025
Middle child. they tend to be...
- Yeah?

660
00:27:30.108 --> 00:27:31.735
...more relaxed. easygoing in life.

661
00:27:31.818 --> 00:27:34.238
You see?
- I'm sorry. I should've just let you

662
00:27:34.321 --> 00:27:37.324
do the compliment. Yeah. Yeah.
- Finish? Yeah. Yeah. yeah.

663
00:27:37.407 --> 00:27:39.076
<i>
See. Lauren? If you put that guard down.</i>

664
00:27:39.159 --> 00:27:41.620
<i>you never know what you might find.</i>

665
00:27:41.703 --> 00:27:42.871
Well. I have nice lips.

666
00:27:42.955 --> 00:27:44.498
- I'm trying. I-I'm trying.
- You're trying.

667
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:48.335
This will never do justice to you. uh.
because you're so beautiful.

668
00:27:48.418 --> 00:27:51.755
but I-I-I-I'm-I'm gonna try...
- Oh. thank you. I appreciate it.

669
00:27:51.839 --> 00:27:52.840
- ...as much as I can.

670
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.677
I definitely want kids. Yeah.
You definitely want kids?

671
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.595
I see myself not having kids.
and I'm okay with that.

672
00:27:58.679 --> 00:28:01.056
I don't think we're compatible.

673
00:28:02.724 --> 00:28:05.102
What are you looking for in a woman?
First and foremost.

674
00:28:05.185 --> 00:28:06.937
I want to be able to have that play.

675
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.480
Like. the goofiness?
Yeah.

676
00:28:08.564 --> 00:28:10.607
You know. you can't take life
too seriously. right?

677
00:28:10.691 --> 00:28:11.942
I like that.

678
00:28:12.025 --> 00:28:15.028
I want someone who's. like.
put together and. like. serious.

679
00:28:15.112 --> 00:28:16.905
but. like. who knows how to have fun.
Yeah.

680
00:28:16.989 --> 00:28:18.574
Just go with the flow.

681
00:28:18.657 --> 00:28:20.951
Go on adventures.
And sometimes you need to have banter

682
00:28:21.034 --> 00:28:22.035
and just fun.
Yeah.

683
00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:25.622

684
00:28:25.706 --> 00:28:28.041

What?

00:28:31.128 --> 00:28:32.629
- No. this was fun.
- Yeah. yeah.

687
00:28:32.713 --> 00:28:33.881
- I had a blast.
- Same.

688
00:28:33.964 --> 00:28:34.965
Yeah.

691
00:28:39.678 --> 00:28:41.388

So good.
You got it or do you got--

711
00:29:38.278 --> 00:29:40.447
- I got it. I got it. Let's go.
- You do it. 'cause I'm...

712
00:29:41.532 --> 00:29:45.077

714
00:29:47.412 --> 00:29:49.665

715
00:29:49.748 --> 00:29:51.834
Let's do that. Cheers.

716
00:29:51.917 --> 00:29:53.752
Cheers. I know.

717
00:29:55.546 --> 00:29:57.381
This is so good.
- So good.

718
00:29:57.464 --> 00:30:00.551
So you have a birthday coming up.

719
00:30:00.634 --> 00:30:05.722
It's so crazy. It's--
I can't believe I'm turning 35 next week.

720
00:30:05.806 --> 00:30:07.266
- This is a milestone birthday.
- I know.

721
00:30:07.349 --> 00:30:08.767
Like. how does that feel for you?

722
00:30:08.851 --> 00:30:10.561
I think when I was younger.

723
00:30:10.644 --> 00:30:14.147
I definitely thought I was gonna be
in a very different place.

724
00:30:14.231 --> 00:30:16.984
I thought I was already.
already gonna be in a relationship.

725
00:30:17.067 --> 00:30:19.820
You know. just being in Rome
has been so exciting.

726
00:30:19.903 --> 00:30:22.239
Every date I had was great.

727
00:30:22.322 --> 00:30:23.824
Like. all the boys are amazing.

728
00:30:23.907 --> 00:30:27.119
I've stepped out
of my comfort zone in a good way.

729
00:30:27.202 --> 00:30:29.288
You know. I've been single
for seven years.

730
00:30:29.371 --> 00:30:31.248
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It's wild to say

731
00:30:31.331 --> 00:30:34.960
and it's been a long time. and I've been
craving some love in my life.

732
00:30:35.043 --> 00:30:38.046
- Yeah.
- And I think there is also another side

733
00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:41.633
where 35 has been a milestone.
where. like...

734
00:30:46.513 --> 00:30:49.016
- It's okay. It's okay.
-  Um...

735
00:30:56.148 --> 00:30:57.774
I got you. girl.

736
00:30:59.359 --> 00:31:00.819
You need a hug?

737
00:31:07.451 --> 00:31:10.662
You know. in the Indian culture.
there's this pressure of. like.

738
00:31:10.746 --> 00:31:13.373
being married.
and I'm the oldest daughter. and...

739
00:31:13.457 --> 00:31:16.293
when my sister got engaged.
who's four years younger.

740
00:31:16.376 --> 00:31:18.962
my mom. she was just so angry.

741
00:31:19.046 --> 00:31:20.464
She stopped talking to me.

742
00:31:21.632 --> 00:31:24.551
It's like my birthday is. like. a reminder

743
00:31:24.635 --> 00:31:28.222
of how many years I've been single
and I haven't found love.

744
00:31:29.264 --> 00:31:34.770
But just know that there are so many
women in society that have that pressure.

745
00:31:34.853 --> 00:31:38.190
You know. "Get married."
Get married by a certain age

746
00:31:38.273 --> 00:31:42.361
and not really allowing that woman
to follow her true happiness

747
00:31:42.444 --> 00:31:44.446
and what makes sense for her.
- Right.

748
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:47.741
You have to make decisions
that are right for you...

749
00:31:47.824 --> 00:31:49.910
- Yeah.
- ...and that they're not always
right for your family.

750
00:31:49.993 --> 00:31:51.370
- Right. Yeah.
- And honestly.

751
00:31:51.453 --> 00:31:53.830
where you're at today. 35.
yes. you're still single.

752
00:31:53.914 --> 00:31:55.374
But we're in Rome. we're looking for love.

753
00:31:55.457 --> 00:31:59.545
Two years ago. I mean. would you even
have been in that headspace?

754
00:31:59.628 --> 00:32:01.421
Honestly?
- No. No. I wouldn't have.

755
00:32:01.505 --> 00:32:04.800
So. so then you're doing
what feels good for you in that moment.

756
00:32:04.883 --> 00:32:08.345
Yeah. And I want to do it for me.
and I think that's what this was.

757
00:32:08.428 --> 00:32:09.805
Is like. you know...
- And you're doing it. too.

758
00:32:09.888 --> 00:32:12.307
...focusing on my birthday again
to. like. hopefully revive it

759
00:32:12.391 --> 00:32:14.393
to be a special thing.
- Yeah.

760
00:32:14.476 --> 00:32:15.811
But happy tears.

761
00:32:15.894 --> 00:32:20.065
Now I just want to focus on. you know.
having fun in Rome

762
00:32:20.148 --> 00:32:21.400
and just finding my love...
- You're having fun.

763
00:32:21.483 --> 00:32:22.818
...you know. on my own terms.

764
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:24.444
Girl. we got you.

765
00:32:24.528 --> 00:32:25.696
Thank you.

766
00:32:28.866 --> 00:32:32.953
<i>This journey is proving to be
a challenging one for my ladies.</i>

767
00:32:33.036 --> 00:32:36.999
<i>but it's all about breaking old patterns
and making deeper connections.</i>

772

<i>is more than just what's on the surface.</i>

773
00:33:01.148 --> 00:33:05.027
This guy. I think. really did
something bad to cut off his head.

774
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:07.946
This one's missing a toe.

775
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.699
Should we see some more stuff?
- Yes.

776
00:33:10.782 --> 00:33:12.201
Want to be on the left?

777
00:33:12.284 --> 00:33:13.785
Sorry. I'm really superstitious.

778
00:33:13.869 --> 00:33:15.245
About being on the left or right?

779
00:33:15.329 --> 00:33:17.998
Yes. Think that on my boat.
I use pepper.

780
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:19.958
So. in Italy. we use the pepper.
the red pepper.

781
00:33:20.042 --> 00:33:21.043
So. on my boat.

782
00:33:21.126 --> 00:33:23.504
I wear a swimsuit with pepper.

783
00:33:23.587 --> 00:33:26.632
and then I have a little red pepper on top
that brings me luck.

784
00:33:26.715 --> 00:33:28.759
What does the pepper do?
It's just lucky.

785
00:33:28.842 --> 00:33:31.637
Is. eh. um. what's called.
how you say that. um.

786
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.096
eyes of the devil? Something like that.

787
00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.140
- That keeps away the eyes of the devil.
- Yes.

788
00:33:37.684 --> 00:33:40.062
<i>
I want to know. what's your type?</i>

789
00:33:40.145 --> 00:33:43.148
<i>
So. I don't have a physical type.</i>

790
00:33:43.232 --> 00:33:44.233
- No? Which is good.
- And I think

791
00:33:44.316 --> 00:33:46.818
that's what most people mean
when they ask that question.

792
00:33:46.902 --> 00:33:49.613
For me. it's all about a spirit.

793
00:33:49.696 --> 00:33:51.657
and that is kind of...
- Oh.

794
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.075
Do you like Italian spirit?
- ...something that

795
00:33:53.158 --> 00:33:55.285
must be discovered. you know?

796
00:33:55.369 --> 00:33:58.163
Do you need to love
the culture of a person? So...

797
00:33:58.247 --> 00:34:01.208
- That certainly is a plus.
- That's for sure.

798
00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:02.459
But do you like Italian culture?

799
00:34:02.543 --> 00:34:05.420
- I love Italian culture. I love it.
- Okay. which is...

800
00:34:05.504 --> 00:34:07.714
That's what I wanted to hear.
- Yes.

801
00:34:07.798 --> 00:34:09.967
- Are you about--
- How about you? What are you...

802
00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.301
- What's my type?
- ...looking for?

803
00:34:11.385 --> 00:34:14.763
So. my type has never been
like an Italian. actually.

804
00:34:14.847 --> 00:34:17.391
Always been an American girl.

805
00:34:17.474 --> 00:34:19.059
Hmm.

806
00:34:19.142 --> 00:34:22.771
And do you picture yourself
being in a serious relationship?

807
00:34:22.855 --> 00:34:23.897
Do you--
- Yeah. I do.

808
00:34:23.981 --> 00:34:26.024
Do you want to get married?
Do you want to have kids?

809
00:34:26.108 --> 00:34:28.902
I love kids. I want kids.

810
00:34:28.986 --> 00:34:29.987
That's my goal.

811
00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:33.073
I'm starting to think
about having a future

812
00:34:33.156 --> 00:34:36.076
and with a girl.
but I'm also thinking about my job.

813
00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:39.246
So. owning a company.
bringing. like. to a certain level

814
00:34:39.329 --> 00:34:41.540
where I can afford to have a family.

815
00:34:41.623 --> 00:34:43.083
- Hmm.
- Yeah?

816
00:34:43.166 --> 00:34:44.710
- You're preparing for your future.
- Yeah.

817
00:34:44.793 --> 00:34:46.253
I want to be able to provide.

818
00:34:46.336 --> 00:34:47.337
That's how I feel.
- That's beautiful.

819
00:34:47.421 --> 00:34:49.673
- Thank you.
- That's very traditional. I like it.

820
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.938
Is. uh. where you live?

821
00:35:05.022 --> 00:35:07.149
Yes. You like it?

822
00:35:07.232 --> 00:35:08.692
Is it all pink?

823
00:35:08.775 --> 00:35:11.028
Barbie out.

824
00:35:11.778 --> 00:35:13.197
I love it.

825
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.874
I had a really nice time with you.

826
00:35:23.957 --> 00:35:26.293
It was a great day.

827
00:35:26.376 --> 00:35:28.170

You're. like. you're not into PDA?

1029
00:44:01.058 --> 00:44:03.560
Am I. am I a PDA person?

1030
00:44:03.644 --> 00:44:05.479
I don't think anyone's ever asked me that.
I'm. like. "Mm."

1031
00:44:05.562 --> 00:44:08.190
No. I. I ask. uh. I guess

1032
00:44:08.273 --> 00:44:10.943
one of my relationships was. like. no PDA.

1033
00:44:11.026 --> 00:44:13.779
Like. just nervous in general
when it came to...

1034
00:44:13.862 --> 00:44:15.697
Yeah. yeah. You know what I mean?
- Oh. no. I'm not like that at all.

1035
00:44:15.781 --> 00:44:17.866
Exactly. If you feel it. you just do it.
You don't have to--

1036
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:19.451
Yeah. you just. I just go with the flow.

1037
00:44:19.535 --> 00:44:23.413
So. I guess. why are you.
why are you single right now?

1038
00:44:23.497 --> 00:44:26.375
Like. what's making it
difficult for you to just

1039
00:44:26.458 --> 00:44:28.710
finding the right person?
- Um. I think it's just...

1040
00:44:28.794 --> 00:44:30.629
I think it's the balance

1041
00:44:30.712 --> 00:44:33.173
of working and having someone

1042
00:44:33.257 --> 00:44:35.509
that can fit the lifestyle that I do.

1043
00:44:35.592 --> 00:44:37.928
Um. in 2017.

1044
00:44:38.011 --> 00:44:40.556
I made history
at the New York Stock Exchange.

1045
00:44:40.639 --> 00:44:42.307
- Yeah? How so?
- Yeah.

1046
00:44:42.391 --> 00:44:44.351
As the youngest trader on the floor and--

1047
00:44:44.434 --> 00:44:45.894
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1048
00:44:45.978 --> 00:44:47.813
- That's amazing. That's impressive.
- Yeah. Thank you.

1049
00:44:47.896 --> 00:44:50.315
So. yeah. it's like finding
that person I can be

1050
00:44:50.399 --> 00:44:52.526
able to do both with.
- Right. Right. right. right.

1051
00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:54.820
That can adapt and kind of be there...
- But not. like. yeah.

1052
00:44:54.903 --> 00:44:57.322
But not. like. always around. Yeah.

1053
00:44:57.406 --> 00:45:00.993
And I think that's kind of what
broke off my relationship. as well.

1054
00:45:01.076 --> 00:45:03.537
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Was not understanding that lifestyle.

1055
00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.789
In order to have a good life
and be able to travel.

1056
00:45:05.873 --> 00:45:07.666
you also had to work for it. right?

1057
00:45:07.749 --> 00:45:08.792
- Yeah. yeah.
- Yeah.

1058
00:45:08.876 --> 00:45:10.586
Not everybody. you know.
not everybody's...
- No. no. no. no. Not everybody gets that.

1059
00:45:10.669 --> 00:45:12.588
- ...in the same page. so. yeah.
- Yeah. for sure.

1060
00:45:12.671 --> 00:45:14.381
If you understand that.
for me. that's perfect.

1061
00:45:14.464 --> 00:45:16.383
Yeah.

1062
00:45:16.466 --> 00:45:17.801
Okay.
Enjoy.

1063
00:45:17.885 --> 00:45:19.553
Oh. my goodness. We made this?
- Oh. my God.

1064
00:45:19.636 --> 00:45:22.097
- This is us?
- This is you.

1065
00:45:22.181 --> 00:45:23.307
This is beautiful.

1066
00:45:26.226 --> 00:45:28.020
- Wait. what did she say?
- Eh...

1067
00:45:28.103 --> 00:45:30.731
A lot of happiness
for your love. basically.

1068
00:45:30.814 --> 00:45:33.483
- Aw! That's so cute.
- Yeah. so. Yeah. it is. it is.

1069
00:45:33.567 --> 00:45:36.028
This looks very good.
- This looks ama-- We did this.

1070
00:45:36.111 --> 00:45:38.488
- So-- Exactly. We did. right?
- This is amazing.

1071
00:45:40.908 --> 00:45:43.076
Oh. my God.
- It's good.

1072
00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.078
- It's so good.
- It's like orgasm. Like...

1073
00:45:45.162 --> 00:45:47.789
I literally love pasta to that level.

1074
00:45:47.873 --> 00:45:50.292
So. um...

1075
00:45:50.375 --> 00:45:52.753
Oh!
- What?

1076
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.798
Wait. what was
your initial reaction to me?

1077
00:45:56.882 --> 00:45:59.218
Um. you seem guarded. to be honest.

1078
00:45:59.301 --> 00:46:00.928
- Yeah.
- I kind of felt

1079
00:46:01.011 --> 00:46:03.805
you were kind of sensing
or kind of trying to understand me

1080
00:46:03.889 --> 00:46:06.141
before you kind of showed
your-your true self.

1081
00:46:06.225 --> 00:46:09.061
I just was trying to. like. process.

1082
00:46:09.144 --> 00:46:11.188
- Yeah?
- I was thinking. I was processing.

1083
00:46:11.271 --> 00:46:13.690
- Getting all that information?
- Yeah. Am I as guarded today?

1084
00:46:13.774 --> 00:46:15.984
- No. no. no. no. You're night and day.
- No?

1085
00:46:16.068 --> 00:46:17.486
Night and day?

1086
00:46:19.655 --> 00:46:20.739
- You seem a lot more confident.
- Well. you are in my kitchen

1087
00:46:20.822 --> 00:46:22.115
in my house...
- E-Exactly.

1088
00:46:22.199 --> 00:46:23.659
- ...so I guess I could
let loose a little bit more.
- So you do feel. yeah...

1089
00:46:23.742 --> 00:46:25.244
Exac-- exactly.
- Yeah.

1090
00:46:25.327 --> 00:46:26.537
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
- Yeah.

1091
00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.372
I-I like that side of you.

1092
00:46:29.373 --> 00:46:32.251
I really like this. and I enjoyed
the time. This is amazing.

1093
00:47:16.628 --> 00:47:19.923
<i>Wow. Art class Christian's
gone the extra mile for this date.</i>

1094
00:47:20.007 --> 00:47:22.718
<i>Could this be the start
of Dhruva's happily ever after?</i>

1095
00:47:22.801 --> 00:47:24.261
Today's such a nice day.

1096
00:47:24.344 --> 00:47:26.180
I know. That bike ride was perfect.

1097
00:47:26.263 --> 00:47:28.974
<i>Salute.</i>
- Cheers.

1098
00:47:29.975 --> 00:47:31.852
Are we gonna do like the Romans do?

1099
00:47:36.064 --> 00:47:38.483
Oh. no.

1100
00:47:40.402 --> 00:47:42.321
- Thank you.
- I love it.

1101
00:47:42.404 --> 00:47:44.323
So. where do you live? Are you in...

1102
00:47:44.406 --> 00:47:45.949
I'm in L.A. Like. Santa Monica.

1103
00:47:46.033 --> 00:47:47.784
I live in Marina.

1104
00:47:47.868 --> 00:47:49.620
Like. probably down the street from you.
- That's...

1105
00:47:49.703 --> 00:47:51.496
That's a good-- that's some good news.
- Yeah.

1106
00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.166
I know. so it's pretty convenient.
- Amazing.

1107
00:47:54.249 --> 00:47:55.584
Why haven't we bumped into each other?

1108
00:47:55.667 --> 00:47:57.544
- I don't know. Honestly.
- It takes us to get to-to Rome

1109
00:47:57.628 --> 00:47:59.588
for us to-to cross paths?
- I know.

1110
00:47:59.671 --> 00:48:03.717
I'm kind of excited because I left L.A.
to kind of. like...

1111
00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.303
just get out of the pressure of dating...
- Yeah.

1112
00:48:06.386 --> 00:48:08.722
...and just go somewhere
and explore. and behold.

1113
00:48:08.805 --> 00:48:11.350
I meet you. and you live. like. really.

1114
00:48:11.433 --> 00:48:13.227
down the street.
- Right next door. Yeah.

1115
00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:15.521
What are the things
that you get into for fun?

1116
00:48:15.604 --> 00:48:18.065
I will go to dinners.
I like to go on hikes.

1117
00:48:18.148 --> 00:48:19.942
- I-I backpack. Like...
- No way.

1118
00:48:20.025 --> 00:48:22.194
But I typically do more the. like.
"everything I need to survive

1119
00:48:22.277 --> 00:48:24.947
on my back" camping version.
so... to survive.

1120
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:26.782
Honestly. I've never been camping.

1121
00:48:26.865 --> 00:48:28.867
- Is that right?
- I-I feel like I would be. like.
the glamping type of girl.

1122
00:48:28.951 --> 00:48:30.911
- Uh-- fair. A million percent.
- But I'm always willing

1123
00:48:30.994 --> 00:48:32.871
to try it.
- I'm-I'm the first to be a glamping girl.

1124
00:48:32.955 --> 00:48:34.581
- Yeah?
- I mean. so that's no big deal at all.

1125
00:48:34.665 --> 00:48:36.166
- I definitely want to travel more.
- Absolutely.

1126
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:37.709
I want to do some things

1127
00:48:37.793 --> 00:48:38.961
before I want to settle down.
- Yeah. of course.

1128
00:48:39.044 --> 00:48:40.754
You know.
do you see kids in your future?

1129
00:48:40.838 --> 00:48:41.755
- A million percent. yeah.
- Yeah?

1130
00:48:41.839 --> 00:48:43.423
- I think I'd be
a really great dad. but...
- Yeah?

1131
00:48:43.507 --> 00:48:44.925
- Both of your parents live together?
- Yeah.

1132
00:48:45.008 --> 00:48:46.301
- Yeah.
- Yeah. yeah. They're still together.

1133
00:48:46.385 --> 00:48:48.720
and. uh. they're both-- all in Atlanta.
and the extended family.

1134
00:48:48.804 --> 00:48:50.931
I was kind of was raised
in a big. like. Italian family.
- Yeah.

1135
00:48:51.014 --> 00:48:53.851
My dad and my parents were
such great models and parents to me

1136
00:48:53.934 --> 00:48:57.020
that. you know. they've instilled
that kind of desire to follow

1137
00:48:57.104 --> 00:49:00.274
in their footsteps and-and kind of
build that family of my own.

1138
00:49:00.357 --> 00:49:01.775
It's funny.
'cause everything you're saying

1139
00:49:01.859 --> 00:49:03.861
is so similar to how I am.
- Yeah?

1140
00:49:07.155 --> 00:49:09.366
Even when we were drawing
our ridiculous drawings.

1141
00:49:09.449 --> 00:49:10.576
I really didn't want to leave.

1142
00:49:10.659 --> 00:49:11.785
Did you want to leave?
- No.

1143
00:49:11.869 --> 00:49:13.829
But you make me nervous a little bit.

1144
00:49:13.912 --> 00:49:16.039
- Do other girls make you this nervous?
- Mm-mm.

1145
00:49:16.123 --> 00:49:18.000
- Why?
- That smile. those eyes. I don't know.

1146
00:49:33.098 --> 00:49:35.017
I feel like I don't want this date to end.

1147
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:36.727

00:50:54.096 --> 00:50:56.014
Waterfalls?

1171
00:50:56.098 --> 00:50:57.599
This is a real-life fairy tale.

1172
00:50:57.683 --> 00:50:59.476
- Chips!

1173
00:51:01.979 --> 00:51:03.105
Oh. my goodness.

1174
00:51:03.188 --> 00:51:04.815
Scripts. Scripts.
- Scripts.

1175
00:51:04.898 --> 00:51:07.150
- Stop. Not again.
- Oh. my gosh.

1176
00:51:07.234 --> 00:51:09.069
Here.
"Exterior.

1177
00:51:09.152 --> 00:51:11.446

1182
00:51:23.458 --> 00:51:26.211
Stop.

1183
00:51:26.295 --> 00:51:27.629
You first. Dhruva.

1184
00:51:27.713 --> 00:51:30.299
Honestly. I've had amazing dates.
and I came into this

1185
00:51:30.382 --> 00:51:33.468
letting go of pressure and just going
with the flow. and I've done that.

1186
00:51:33.552 --> 00:51:35.512
I did. like. all the three of the guys.

1187
00:51:35.596 --> 00:51:37.681
but I feel like Christian

1188
00:51:37.764 --> 00:51:39.516
<i>pulled my heart.</i>

1189
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:43.020
I was a little bit giddy
because it just felt so natural.

1190
00:51:43.103 --> 00:51:46.440
And my goofiness.
he kind of played with that.

1191
00:51:46.523 --> 00:51:47.858
Do you feel like Christian

1192
00:51:47.941 --> 00:51:49.401
breaks your old patterns?
- Would be breaking the pattern?

1193
00:51:49.484 --> 00:51:52.362
I think when I was. you know.
dating previously.

1194
00:51:52.446 --> 00:51:54.740
maybe I didn't think about
the future as much

1195
00:51:54.823 --> 00:51:56.950
because I don't think I was ready.

1196
00:51:57.034 --> 00:51:59.161
I've never brought a guy home
to my parents.

1197
00:51:59.244 --> 00:52:03.081
and I told myself I never would
unless if I saw a future or a fit.

1198
00:52:03.165 --> 00:52:05.959
And I think I never saw that
in my exes 'cause I was having fun.

1199
00:52:06.043 --> 00:52:09.254
<i>and Nicola kind of reminds me of that.</i>

1200
00:52:09.338 --> 00:52:12.591
And so. I think that's why I'm. like.
trying to break that pattern.

1201
00:52:12.674 --> 00:52:14.885
You know. I want to find that guy
I can have my forever with

1202
00:52:14.968 --> 00:52:16.261
and introduce my family to.

1203
00:52:16.345 --> 00:52:20.474
so I think I can definitely see myself
introducing Christian.

1204
00:52:20.557 --> 00:52:22.142
Wow.

1205
00:52:22.226 --> 00:52:23.477
What about you?

1206
00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:26.146
I think Lorenzo is the first choice.

1207
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:30.108
<i>Obviously. super attractive.
and so much fun.</i>

1208
00:52:30.192 --> 00:52:32.611
And Brandon was such a surprise.

1209
00:52:32.694 --> 00:52:34.655
Like. out of nowhere. I was just. like.

1210
00:52:34.738 --> 00:52:37.449
<i>drinking in this fountain
and this gorgeous man shows up.</i>

1211
00:52:37.533 --> 00:52:39.910
So I'm looking forward
to spending more time with him. too.

1212
00:52:39.993 --> 00:52:42.120
- I love that.
- What about you. Lauren?

1213
00:52:42.204 --> 00:52:43.956
I think...

1214
00:52:44.039 --> 00:52:47.000
<i>Alessandro. he is just so smooth.</i>

1215
00:52:47.084 --> 00:52:49.503
<i>but it really is just a fling.</i>

1216
00:52:49.586 --> 00:52:52.422
I think. for me. it's gonna be Ethos.

1217
00:52:52.506 --> 00:52:55.342
<i>The fact that him and I
were just able to. like. sit and talk</i>

1218
00:52:55.425 --> 00:52:57.636
and. like. really get to know each other.

1219
00:52:57.719 --> 00:53:00.889
He travels. and he speaks
so many different languages. he can cook.

1220
00:53:00.973 --> 00:53:03.684
But there's also a hesitation in me

1221
00:53:03.767 --> 00:53:09.356
because there's a lot of fear
that goes into sharing with people.

1222
00:53:09.439 --> 00:53:12.985
And so. I'm scared
to navigate the next steps.

1223
00:53:15.153 --> 00:53:18.031
<i>
Opening your heart is never an easy thing.</i>

1224
00:53:18.115 --> 00:53:21.326
<i>even with the help of a clever narrator.
Ahem.</i>

1225
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:25.497
<i>With love. sometimes
it's the most unexpected thing</i>

1226
00:53:25.581 --> 00:53:28.792
<i>that can change everything.</i>

1227
00:53:28.876 --> 00:53:31.003
Apparently. the average man

1228
00:53:31.086 --> 00:53:33.714
thinks about Rome all the time.

1229
00:53:33.797 --> 00:53:36.258
They think about the Roman Empire.
- Is that a joke?

1230
00:53:36.341 --> 00:53:37.509
No. it's real.

1231
00:53:37.593 --> 00:53:40.137
Men are obsessed with the Roman Empire.

1232
00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:42.973
- It's the fighting.
I think it's <i>Gladiator.</i>
- Yeah.

1233
00:53:43.056 --> 00:53:45.058
How excited are you
that Lorenzo's coming?

1234
00:53:45.142 --> 00:53:48.187
I feel like you've been bitten
after him after the museum.

1235
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:51.190
Yeah. I think. like.
my first impression.

1236
00:53:51.273 --> 00:53:52.649
I didn't really know what to think.

1237
00:53:52.733 --> 00:53:56.486
And then. as time has gone on. I'm. like.

1238
00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:58.655
kind of can't stop
thinking about him. you know?

1239
00:53:58.739 --> 00:54:00.157
- I'm so happy for you.
- I'm nervous.

1240
00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.075
He's. like. coming into our world.

1241
00:54:02.159 --> 00:54:03.452
you know?
- Yeah.

1242
00:54:03.535 --> 00:54:04.828
Really?
- You have to help me. like...

1243
00:54:04.912 --> 00:54:07.497
I will. I will third-wheel.
I-I will make him feel comfortable.

1244
00:54:07.581 --> 00:54:10.083
I feel like he's so easygoing. too.

1245
00:54:10.167 --> 00:54:11.752
- Yeah.
- So I'm here for it.

1246
00:54:11.835 --> 00:54:14.838
I'm curious how it's going
with Christian.

1247
00:54:14.922 --> 00:54:17.508
Honestly. I can't stop
thinking about him.

1248
00:54:17.591 --> 00:54:19.551
Um...

1249
00:54:19.635 --> 00:54:20.802
Hello. guys.

1250
00:54:20.886 --> 00:54:22.387
Stop!
Hi.

1251
00:54:22.471 --> 00:54:24.932
<i>
Whoa. even I wasn't expecting Lorenzo</i>

1252
00:54:25.015 --> 00:54:28.519
<i>to bring his cocaptain Nicola.
but this is a real rom-com.</i>

1253
00:54:28.602 --> 00:54:32.064
<i>so. looks like Dhruva's story
is going off-script.</i>

1254
00:54:32.147 --> 00:54:33.899
What a beautiful surprise.

1255
00:54:33.982 --> 00:54:35.150
Um...
- Mm. You're beautiful.

1256
00:54:35.234 --> 00:54:36.568
Hi.
I didn't know
you were bringing a friend.

1257
00:54:36.652 --> 00:54:38.654
You see? I came.

1258
00:54:38.737 --> 00:54:40.197
- Hi. how are you?
- How are you. Dhruva?

1259
00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.199
- Good.
- Well. hello.

1260
00:54:42.282 --> 00:54:43.450
- How are you?
- Good job.

1261
00:54:44.826 --> 00:54:46.119
- So. how were these days?
- It was good.

1262
00:54:46.203 --> 00:54:47.204
Yeah?

1263
00:54:49.289 --> 00:54:50.332
Of course I do.

1264
00:54:50.415 --> 00:54:52.000
It's really nice.

1265
00:54:52.084 --> 00:54:53.502
Christa Belle.
- Yes. my love?

1266
00:54:53.585 --> 00:54:55.337
Are you gonna open the limoncello?

1267
00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:56.755
Oh. yeah. uh. let's have a taste

1268
00:54:56.839 --> 00:54:58.131
of the limoncello.
- Wow.

1269
00:54:58.215 --> 00:55:00.092
- Let's have a...

1270
00:55:00.175 --> 00:55:01.969
Please don't get. uh.
don't get drunk. huh?

1271
00:55:02.052 --> 00:55:03.428
Ooh.

1272
00:55:03.512 --> 00:55:04.930
- You like it?
- I already had a tequila shot.

1273
00:55:05.013 --> 00:55:06.974
Ah...

1274
00:55:07.057 --> 00:55:08.600
You guys have a pool?
Is that okay?

1275
00:55:08.684 --> 00:55:09.852
This is the house you're staying?
Yes.

1276
00:55:09.935 --> 00:55:11.395
- Beautiful view.
- So. can I have a seat here.

1277
00:55:11.478 --> 00:55:13.397
close to you? Do you mind?
Yeah.

1278
00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.482
- Yeah. no. I don't.
- Okay.

1279
00:55:15.566 --> 00:55:17.192
Let me slide. How are you?

1280
00:55:17.276 --> 00:55:18.819
- Want to go for a dip?
- Sure.

1281
00:55:18.902 --> 00:55:20.612

So much for being a third wheel.</i>

1282

<i>You're in the driver's seat now. Dee.</i>

1283
00:55:23.156 --> 00:55:24.825
Honestly. when I first saw you.

1284
00:55:24.908 --> 00:55:28.161
I was like. you're so attractive.
obviously you are.

1285
00:55:28.245 --> 00:55:29.454
You think so?
- Yeah.

1286
00:55:29.538 --> 00:55:32.541
Also. you know. of course.
you are a really beautiful girl.

1287
00:55:32.624 --> 00:55:33.542
- Yeah.
- I like the...

1288
00:55:33.625 --> 00:55:35.502
that you opened up with me.

1289
00:55:35.586 --> 00:55:37.379
about family.
- Mm.

1290
00:55:37.462 --> 00:55:39.131
So that always I open myself.

1291
00:55:39.214 --> 00:55:40.591
also. to someone.
- Yeah.

1292
00:55:40.674 --> 00:55:43.260
Do I make you comfortable? That's why?

1293
00:55:43.343 --> 00:55:46.346
Yes. you do. I told you.
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

1294
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:47.723
That's why I like you.

1295
00:55:47.806 --> 00:55:51.226
I'm glad I-- you're here. because
I get to see another side of you.

1296
00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:54.980
I definitely want you
to share more. like. deeper stuff.

1297
00:55:55.063 --> 00:55:56.190
Maybe later.

1298
00:55:59.651 --> 00:56:00.694
Maybe we should get a drink.

1299
00:56:00.777 --> 00:56:02.237
Do you want to get a drink?
- Okay. Let's get a drink.

only a day away.</i>

1336
00:58:15.162 --> 00:58:19.333
<i>it's the final chance for our couples
to spend some one-on-one time together</i>

1337
00:58:19.416 --> 00:58:22.336
<i>before our leading ladies
write their endings.</i>

1338
00:58:26.048 --> 00:58:27.716
So. what I would do is snip it
right from there where it hits the...

1339
00:58:27.799 --> 00:58:31.094
- And. uh. from the stem. right?
- Yep. that's great.

1340
00:58:31.178 --> 00:58:32.596
- Okay.
- Beautiful.

1341
00:58:32.679 --> 00:58:34.681
- Look at that.
- Wow.

1342
00:58:34.765 --> 00:58:36.058
So beautiful.

1343
00:58:36.141 --> 00:58:40.395
I have a very serious question for you.
- Yes.

1344
00:58:40.479 --> 00:58:42.272
How often...

1345
00:58:44.399 --> 00:58:47.361
...do you think about the Roman Empire?

1346
00:58:47.444 --> 00:58:51.365
Wow. I actually have thought about it
q-quite frequently. recently.

1347
00:58:51.448 --> 00:58:53.116
- You do. right?
- Yeah.

1348
00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:54.952
Before even coming to Rome. right?

1349
00:58:55.035 --> 00:58:56.328
- Before coming to Rome. for sure.
- Yeah.

1350
00:58:56.411 --> 00:58:58.789
The Roman Empire. like.
made some cool stuff.

1351
00:58:58.872 --> 00:59:00.874
They developed aqueducts. roads.

1352
00:59:00.958 --> 00:59:03.001
sanitation.

1353
00:59:03.085 --> 00:59:05.921
- Boys really love the Roman empire.
- Yeah.

1354
00:59:07.756 --> 00:59:09.883
It's so weird! Aah!

1355
00:59:09.967 --> 00:59:11.385
Oh. my gosh. Yep. yep. yep.

1356
00:59:11.468 --> 00:59:12.761
Oh. my God.

1357
00:59:12.845 --> 00:59:14.304
- Okay. now we're working.
- Gooey.

1358
00:59:14.388 --> 00:59:17.391
There's some slippery little suckers.

1359
00:59:17.474 --> 00:59:19.059
- Slide in here.
- This is so weird.

1360
00:59:19.142 --> 00:59:20.811
Ugh. Okay. we got to make sure

1361
00:59:20.894 --> 00:59:23.021
no grape is left out.

1362
00:59:23.105 --> 00:59:24.690
- Do a little spin.
- A little spin?

1363
00:59:24.773 --> 00:59:25.774
Yeah. a little dance.

1364
00:59:25.858 --> 00:59:27.651
Well. it was gonna be...

1365
00:59:27.734 --> 00:59:29.278
Love it.

1366
00:59:33.699 --> 00:59:34.700
Don't fall.

1367
00:59:34.783 --> 00:59:36.910
I got it. I got good balance.

1368
00:59:36.994 --> 00:59:38.620
Run.

1369
00:59:41.748 --> 00:59:43.584
Do you. uh. do you have a big family?

1370
00:59:43.667 --> 00:59:45.544
- I do. I have eight older brothers.
- Oh. no way.

1371
00:59:45.627 --> 00:59:46.795
- Um...
- Eight.

1372
00:59:46.879 --> 00:59:48.797
But four of the boys are from my mom.

1373
00:59:48.881 --> 00:59:50.924
four from my dad. and...

1374
00:59:51.008 --> 00:59:53.135
my mom was a single mom

1375
00:59:53.218 --> 00:59:55.137
raising five kids.

1376
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:57.389
She had three jobs

1377
00:59:57.472 --> 00:59:59.933
and was incredibly independent.

1378
01:00:00.017 --> 01:00:03.854
I think that's
kind of where I got it from.

1379
01:00:03.937 --> 01:00:06.190
I've always taken care of myself.

1380
01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:08.901
There's no. like. family...

1381
01:00:08.984 --> 01:00:12.905
money or legacy
or anything to really fall back on.

1382
01:00:12.988 --> 01:00:14.656
so I've always been very independent.

1383
01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.991
Wow. that's wonderful.

1384
01:00:16.074 --> 01:00:17.409
How about you?

1385
01:00:17.492 --> 01:00:19.912
Um. when I was about six. my dad left.

1386
01:00:19.995 --> 01:00:22.247
and then he ended up
passing away a few years later.

1387
01:00:22.331 --> 01:00:24.791
so I was raised by my mom.
along with my brother.

1388
01:00:24.875 --> 01:00:27.669
And just. you know. seeing her
firsthand go through that.

1389
01:00:27.753 --> 01:00:30.964
you know... you know. that journey of
raising two boys on her own.

1390
01:00:31.048 --> 01:00:33.008
it really taught me that. like.
women are queens

1391
01:00:33.091 --> 01:00:36.136
and men should be there
to protect. to provide.

1392
01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:37.554
That's really beautiful.

1393
01:00:45.646 --> 01:00:49.191
♪ So let me go ♪

1394
01:00:49.274 --> 01:00:50.651
- All right. you come here. you.
- Okay.

1395
01:00:50.734 --> 01:00:52.027
Up you go.

1396
01:00:53.362 --> 01:00:55.531
- Oh. why. thank you.
- Of course.

1397
01:00:58.742 --> 01:01:00.619
Love it.

1398
01:01:02.788 --> 01:01:06.542
Hm. Definitely wasn't expecting
to find this connection.

1399
01:01:06.625 --> 01:01:09.545
but here we are. What does it look like to

1400
01:01:09.628 --> 01:01:12.130
potentially be in
an exclusive relationship?

1401
01:01:12.214 --> 01:01:14.842
I told you. I haven't been
in a relationship in seven years.

1402
01:01:14.925 --> 01:01:17.177
Eventually. I do want
to settle down to have kids.

1403
01:01:17.261 --> 01:01:19.263
I do want to get married.

1404
01:01:19.346 --> 01:01:21.473
My entire life.
my parents have kind of asked me

1405
01:01:21.557 --> 01:01:22.975
to do things that they wanted me to do.

1406
01:01:23.058 --> 01:01:25.602
'Cause my parents are Indian.
so it was this mentality of

1407
01:01:25.686 --> 01:01:28.313
always. you date Indian.

1408
01:01:28.397 --> 01:01:30.774
After I finished school.
my dad tried to set me up

1409
01:01:30.858 --> 01:01:32.359
with an Indian résumé...
- Okay.

1410
01:01:32.442 --> 01:01:33.569
...to find. like. Indian boys.

1411
01:01:33.652 --> 01:01:34.570
And I just want someone

1412
01:01:34.653 --> 01:01:38.323
to create a life at my terms.
- Absolutely.

1413
01:01:38.407 --> 01:01:41.451
In your past relationships...
How many relationships have you...

1414
01:01:41.535 --> 01:01:44.788
I've only had one long.
committed relationship.

1415
01:01:44.872 --> 01:01:47.666
Is she the only one
you've introduced to your family?

1416
01:01:47.749 --> 01:01:49.793
Yeah. she was the first and only.

1417
01:01:49.877 --> 01:01:52.796
and. uh. that's a big deal for me.
And. so. uh. you know.

1418
01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.007
took that leap of faith a little bit.

1419
01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:58.093
and. uh. you know. it didn't work out.

1420
01:01:58.177 --> 01:01:59.178
You know. that was tough.

1421
01:01:59.261 --> 01:02:01.471
but I think you have
to step away from that and learn.

1422
01:02:01.555 --> 01:02:04.099
I've never introduced a guy
to my parents.

1423
01:02:04.183 --> 01:02:05.184
Not one.
- Wow. Yeah.

1424
01:02:05.267 --> 01:02:07.561
But whoever I bring into my life.

1425
01:02:07.644 --> 01:02:10.856
I've always told my parents
I need them to respect my parents.

1426
01:02:10.939 --> 01:02:12.232
and I think that's so important

1427
01:02:12.316 --> 01:02:14.067
because family is everything.

1428
01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:17.070
A million percent.
Well. for me. like. again.

1429
01:02:17.154 --> 01:02:18.363
it's been a long time. too.

1430
01:02:18.447 --> 01:02:22.326
But one of the. you know.
core tenets about me and just how I move

1431
01:02:22.409 --> 01:02:24.411
and how I am with love is that. you know.

1432
01:02:24.494 --> 01:02:27.206
when I'm in. I'm all the way in.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1433
01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:29.416
And so for me. you know. that exclusivity.

1434
01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:31.543
that locked in. us being. you know.

1435
01:02:31.627 --> 01:02:35.839
in a position to take on
whatever comes our way.

1436
01:02:35.923 --> 01:02:38.258
is kind of where my heart leads.
- Yeah.

1437
01:02:38.342 --> 01:02:39.635
So while being here.

1438
01:02:39.718 --> 01:02:42.054
like. I've really been taken by you.

1439
01:02:42.137 --> 01:02:44.806
and I haven't wanted
to pursue anyone else.

1440
01:02:45.807 --> 01:02:47.684
Monogamy is important to me.

1441
01:02:49.561 --> 01:02:51.563
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

1442
01:02:58.111 --> 01:03:00.656
Getting to know you.
I can see the softness in you.

1443
01:03:00.739 --> 01:03:03.617
I can see your gentle heart

1444
01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.285
and kind of opening up. and it's amazing.

1445
01:03:05.369 --> 01:03:07.287
You want to be strong.

1446
01:03:07.371 --> 01:03:10.082
but I know there's a lot more to you.
- Yeah.

1447
01:03:10.165 --> 01:03:12.543
You don't have to be
strong all the time.

1448
01:03:12.626 --> 01:03:14.419
I know it feels that way.

1449
01:03:14.503 --> 01:03:16.505
but it's-it's okay to. you know.

1450
01:03:16.588 --> 01:03:18.298
to let your guard down.

1451
01:03:19.424 --> 01:03:21.635
This is really tough.

1452
01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:25.180
My family. they're everything.

1453
01:03:26.265 --> 01:03:28.600
Especially my brother.
I-I have a twin brother.

1454
01:03:28.684 --> 01:03:30.811
He's disabled.

1455
01:03:30.894 --> 01:03:34.481
and I think people don't understand
the responsibility of

1456
01:03:34.565 --> 01:03:35.941
what that actually means long term.

1457
01:03:36.024 --> 01:03:38.402
- Of course.
- That's not something that...

1458
01:03:39.486 --> 01:03:42.990
I don't know. it's like having...
it's like having a child.

1459
01:03:43.073 --> 01:03:45.325
- Yes.
- Like. it's a big responsibility.

1460
01:03:45.409 --> 01:03:46.410
Right.

1461
01:03:47.411 --> 01:03:49.580
A lot of the work that I do today
is 'cause of my brother.

1462
01:03:49.663 --> 01:03:52.457
Yeah. and I can see that now.
Yeah. I understand.

1463
01:03:54.459 --> 01:03:56.712
I'm happy that you get my seriousness.

1464
01:03:56.795 --> 01:03:59.339
I get it. 100%. I get it.

1465
01:03:59.423 --> 01:04:02.009
You've done so much
to this point to get here...

1466
01:04:02.092 --> 01:04:03.844
- Yeah.
- ...that you have to be able to

1467
01:04:03.927 --> 01:04:05.137
enjoy it as well.

1468
01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:06.680
I hope there's a time

1469
01:04:06.763 --> 01:04:08.849
and place that I'm able to enjoy it.
I feel like I'm always

1470
01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:11.810
working and going. going. going.
and I'm really grateful for it.

1471
01:04:11.894 --> 01:04:13.061
It's not a complaint.

1472
01:04:13.145 --> 01:04:14.521
But it's really isolating.

1473
01:04:14.605 --> 01:04:17.316
Really. really isolating. and. um...

1474
01:04:17.399 --> 01:04:20.527
I'm... I'm just. I'm ready for
the next chapter

1475
01:04:20.611 --> 01:04:22.446
'cause it's really freaking lonely.

1476
01:04:22.529 --> 01:04:24.406
- So here's this.

1477
01:04:24.489 --> 01:04:25.991
You mentioned having to work

1478
01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:27.701
and not having time for yourself...

1479
01:04:27.784 --> 01:04:29.786
- Yeah.
- ...and I kind of want to change that.

1480
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:32.331
So. I'm taking a train to Tuscany

1481
01:04:32.414 --> 01:04:35.042
in a couple of days. and I would love
for you to come with me

1482
01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:38.212
and kind of enjoy life
and just be in the moment.

1483
01:04:38.295 --> 01:04:42.341
Kind of forget about. you know.
work and be present and...

1484
01:04:42.424 --> 01:04:44.551
What are you thinking?

1485
01:04:54.937 --> 01:04:56.480
Ooh. So pretty.

1486
01:04:56.563 --> 01:04:57.898
Oh. this is so nice.

1487
01:04:57.981 --> 01:04:59.399
- Oh...
- Whoa.

1488
01:04:59.483 --> 01:05:00.609
- So pretty.
- Beautiful.

1489
01:05:00.692 --> 01:05:03.070
You're the best. Thank you.

1490
01:05:03.153 --> 01:05:05.280
He's just trying to pull me closer.
- Yeah.

1491
01:05:05.364 --> 01:05:06.990
- Birthday girl.
- Yes.

1492
01:05:07.074 --> 01:05:08.867
Wow.
- This is the best day.

1493
01:05:08.951 --> 01:05:11.370
The food here is so fresh and so good.

1494
01:05:11.453 --> 01:05:12.829
The pasta just. like. hits.

1495
01:05:12.913 --> 01:05:15.582
Like. you can taste how fresh it is.

1496
01:05:15.666 --> 01:05:17.501
Brandon. Brandon.

1497
01:05:17.584 --> 01:05:20.003
Anytime.
-  Let's try a blueberry.

1498
01:05:20.879 --> 01:05:22.840
Five. six. seven. eight...

<i>

<i>but will his offer
to continue their journey together</i>

1503
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:44.361
<i>send him packing?</i>

1504
01:05:44.444 --> 01:05:46.780
<i>Brandon's charm seems to have
won over Christa Belle.</i>

1505
01:05:46.864 --> 01:05:50.117
<i>but is Lorenzo totally out of the picture?</i>

1506
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:54.705
<i>And Dhruva has to decide if she is ready
to be honest with Christian</i>

1507
01:05:54.788 --> 01:05:58.959
<i>about her unexpected night with Nicola.</i>

1508
01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:01.503
Everyone. I don't mean to pause.

1509
01:06:01.587 --> 01:06:03.297
but I'm gonna have to steal Dhruva
for a moment.

1510
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.465
so we'll be right back.
Okay.

1511
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:07.092
Bye. guys.

1512
01:06:14.808 --> 01:06:17.311
Oh. my God.

1513
01:06:17.394 --> 01:06:19.855
This is so sweet.

1514
01:06:25.194 --> 01:06:26.403
Being here in Rome.

1515
01:06:26.486 --> 01:06:27.821
never thought that we'd cross paths.

1516
01:06:27.905 --> 01:06:31.533
but I'm really glad to be here.
and be here with you.

1517
01:06:33.577 --> 01:06:36.622
I really appreciate that.
Thank you so much.

1518
01:06:36.705 --> 01:06:38.248
Absolutely.

1519
01:06:38.332 --> 01:06:39.625
Oh. my God.

1520
01:06:39.708 --> 01:06:41.168
Happy birthday.

1521
01:06:53.388 --> 01:06:54.723
- One more.

1522
01:06:54.806 --> 01:06:56.808
- There it is...

1523
01:06:56.892 --> 01:06:58.143
I really appreciate you doing this.

1524
01:06:58.227 --> 01:06:59.353
- Of course.
- So sweet.

1525
01:06:59.436 --> 01:07:01.897
Obviously. I came to Rome to find love.

1526
01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:06.068
and. you know.
I think trust is really important for you.

1527
01:07:06.151 --> 01:07:09.071
Um. so I did want to share.

1528
01:07:09.154 --> 01:07:11.490
you know. while we've had our journey...

1529
01:07:13.158 --> 01:07:15.160
...I've been seeing other men.

1530
01:07:18.247 --> 01:07:19.790
But at the end of the day.

1531
01:07:19.873 --> 01:07:25.003
I think I realized that.
out of those other men.

1532
01:07:25.087 --> 01:07:26.713
I want to be with you.

1533
01:07:26.797 --> 01:07:28.715
Um...

1534
01:07:28.799 --> 01:07:31.552
Have you kissed anyone since we've met?

1535
01:07:34.847 --> 01:07:38.225
Um... yes.

1536
01:07:38.308 --> 01:07:43.730
♪ So don't try ♪

1537
01:07:45.858 --> 01:07:48.360
♪ To play me like a fool ♪

1538
01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:51.905
♪ 'Cause I've been a fool for you. ♪

1539
01:08:06.378 --> 01:08:09.840
<i>Christian asked me
if I've been kissing other men.</i>

1540
01:08:10.883 --> 01:08:13.552
A-And I said yes.

1541
01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:18.765
I don't know if he was angry. pissed.
like. I could not put my finger on it.

1542
01:08:20.225 --> 01:08:23.687
I don't know. I don't know how it's...
I don't know.

1543
01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:25.314
I mean. but he knew

1544
01:08:25.397 --> 01:08:27.357
that would happen. right?

1545
01:08:27.441 --> 01:08:28.984
I don't know. I think...

1546
01:08:29.067 --> 01:08:33.238
he clearly has his own past
and has been potentially hurt.

1547
01:08:33.322 --> 01:08:36.575
so I hope. like. you know.

1548
01:08:36.658 --> 01:08:39.870
he can... forgive.

1549
01:08:39.953 --> 01:08:44.082
I really like him. and I just don't know
if I just ruined that by telling him or...

1550
01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:46.001
You-- no. you didn't ruin that.
- ...if it was good to tell him.

1551
01:08:46.084 --> 01:08:48.504
- You needed to tell him.
- Yeah. I did.

1552
01:08:48.587 --> 01:08:51.757
I think that made me realize
that Nicola is just fun. you know?

1553
01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.926
Yeah.

1554
01:08:54.009 --> 01:08:57.596
I definitely feel like
I've learned a lot. regardless.

1555
01:08:57.679 --> 01:08:59.515
Feel like we all have.

1556
01:08:59.598 --> 01:09:01.475
That's all I can ask for.

1557
01:09:01.558 --> 01:09:02.935
So glad we had this experience.

1558
01:09:03.018 --> 01:09:05.145
- I know.
- I mean.

1559
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:07.356
that's kind of the journey
I'm having right now.

1560
01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:09.900
I feel like I came to Rome.

1561
01:09:09.983 --> 01:09:12.402
you know. just kind of excited
to have a fun experience.

1562
01:09:12.486 --> 01:09:16.198
but I'm realizing I had. like...

1563
01:09:16.281 --> 01:09:18.283
kind of. like. a fear...

1564
01:09:18.367 --> 01:09:20.536
definitely a fear of dating.

1565
01:09:20.619 --> 01:09:22.246
Maybe a fear of men?

1566
01:09:22.329 --> 01:09:24.540
Back at home. I was. like. not even...

1567
01:09:24.623 --> 01:09:28.752
People would ask me out.
and I'm like. "I am busy that night.

1568
01:09:28.836 --> 01:09:30.295
"I've got TV to watch

1569
01:09:30.379 --> 01:09:31.797
and. like. popcorn to eat."
You're. like.
dodging the question.

1570
01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.466
Like. somehow.
- Yeah. like. I would find any reason...

1571
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:37.135
- Yeah.
- ...to just not spend any time dating.

1572
01:09:37.219 --> 01:09:39.930
I don't even think I fully realized
I had that fear.

1573
01:09:40.013 --> 01:09:43.183
and now I'm. like.
having the time of my life.

1574
01:09:43.267 --> 01:09:44.434
The best time.

1575
01:09:44.518 --> 01:09:46.103
Like. Lorenzo's fun.

1576
01:09:46.186 --> 01:09:48.647
I don't know. last time we were
on this couch drinking wine.

1577
01:09:48.730 --> 01:09:51.608
Nicola and Lorenzo showed up.
- Limoncello?

1578
01:09:51.692 --> 01:09:54.278
They drank that entire bottle.

1579
01:09:54.361 --> 01:09:58.574
And then. Brandon.
he is very quick-witted in a group.

1580
01:09:58.657 --> 01:10:00.617
He's very good in. like...

1581
01:10:00.701 --> 01:10:03.036
- Yeah.
- ...good in a social situation.

1582
01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:06.540
I was very impressed.
- Yes. he's sweet.

1583
01:10:06.623 --> 01:10:08.876
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be hard. It's gonna be hard.

1584
01:10:08.959 --> 01:10:11.003
Decisions do have to be made.

1585
01:10:11.086 --> 01:10:12.462
Yeah.

1586
01:10:12.546 --> 01:10:13.964
Lauren. how are you feeling?

1587
01:10:14.047 --> 01:10:15.883
You're. like. happy.

1588
01:10:15.966 --> 01:10:18.135
Yeah. Ethos asked me

1589
01:10:18.218 --> 01:10:20.137
to go to Tuscany with him.

1590
01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.681
- Stop. What?
- Yeah. After this is over.

1591
01:10:22.764 --> 01:10:24.683
- I'm sorry.
- Are you gonna do it?

1592
01:10:24.766 --> 01:10:29.229
We'll see. So many things to... at play.

1593
01:10:29.313 --> 01:10:31.732
I don't think I've ever dated anyone

1594
01:10:31.815 --> 01:10:35.152
that actually. like.
matches my level work ethic.

1595
01:10:35.235 --> 01:10:37.863
Like. he says he's a workaholic.
and he loves it. and so am I.

1596
01:10:37.946 --> 01:10:39.448
- That's what you said.
- Yeah.

1597
01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:40.949
- You need that.
- Yeah.
- But...

1598
01:10:41.033 --> 01:10:44.244
my hesitation is like.
"Well. what does that actually look like?"

1599
01:10:44.328 --> 01:10:46.538
I know you mentioned.

1600
01:10:46.622 --> 01:10:49.583
you know. coming into this.
opening up was...

1601
01:10:49.666 --> 01:10:51.919
like. part of your journey.
- Yeah.

1602
01:10:52.002 --> 01:10:55.631
How do you see that going?
How do you see it playing out?

1603
01:10:55.714 --> 01:10:58.050
I think...

1604
01:10:58.133 --> 01:11:01.720
I've always kept a guard up.
and I like keeping my guard up.

1605
01:11:01.803 --> 01:11:06.433
It's not even just men.
Like. my best friends. my family.

1606
01:11:06.517 --> 01:11:09.645
I've never given many individuals
to really...

1607
01:11:13.565 --> 01:11:16.318
...to really be able
to use that power against me.

1608
01:11:16.401 --> 01:11:19.238
because I know how people can be.

1609
01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:24.826
So I just don't allow myself to get
to a place with people-- friends. family--

1610
01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:30.123
to see this side of me.
because it's opening up Pandora's box.

1611
01:11:30.207 --> 01:11:33.335
The moment
you give somebody your power and...

1612
01:11:34.419 --> 01:11:38.131
...they break that trust.
it is really freaking hard to go back.

1613
01:11:38.215 --> 01:11:41.802
So. I just... I just don't do it.

1614
01:11:41.885 --> 01:11:44.930
But I don't want
to always have to feel like

1615
01:11:45.013 --> 01:11:49.142
I'm carrying the world on my shoulders
and feeling like...

1616
01:11:49.226 --> 01:11:51.395
I have to do it by myself.

1617
01:11:51.478 --> 01:11:53.772
Like. at some point. the journey is. like.

1618
01:11:53.856 --> 01:11:57.568
I do want a partner
to show me that level of trust.

1619
01:11:57.651 --> 01:12:00.320
And I don't want to be separated
from people for my entire life.

1620
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:03.031
With Ethos.

1621
01:12:03.115 --> 01:12:05.742
it seems like it can get there.

1622
01:12:05.826 --> 01:12:08.996
I would like to give him that chance.

1623
01:12:12.291 --> 01:12:13.667
I love you guys.

1624
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:15.294

- Here I am.
- Here you are.

1648
01:13:47.636 --> 01:13:49.763
When I first got here.

1649
01:13:49.847 --> 01:13:53.392
I had pretty much sworn off men.

1650
01:13:53.475 --> 01:13:55.352
I've just had a lot of. you know.

1651
01:13:55.435 --> 01:13:58.522
less-than-positive experiences

1652
01:13:58.605 --> 01:14:01.692
when dating. you know.

1653
01:14:01.775 --> 01:14:05.362
I've been kind of closed off
to the idea of.

1654
01:14:05.445 --> 01:14:08.115
you know. really connecting
with someone

1655
01:14:08.198 --> 01:14:11.702
for a while. but. um.

1656
01:14:11.785 --> 01:14:14.580
you know. you really...
you really changed my mind.

1657
01:14:14.663 --> 01:14:16.582
Which is good.

1658
01:14:16.665 --> 01:14:20.419
Are you willing to explore more with me?

1659
01:14:22.296 --> 01:14:24.590
- Yeah.
- You are?

1660
01:14:26.758 --> 01:14:28.802
You opened my mind.

1661
01:14:28.886 --> 01:14:30.387
- I opened your mind?

1662
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:33.390
This journey been amazing. actually.

1663
01:14:33.473 --> 01:14:36.059
It's really funny. because

1664
01:14:36.143 --> 01:14:37.728
when I met you. I was like. "Oh. great."
- Mm. Yeah.

1665
01:14:37.811 --> 01:14:40.022
- "Another. like..."
- Another what?

1666
01:14:40.105 --> 01:14:42.149
Another what? Sorry. Another...?

1667
01:14:42.232 --> 01:14:43.609
- Another guy pouring prosecco...
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1668
01:14:43.692 --> 01:14:45.527
- ...in girls' mouths on a boat.
- Yeah.

1695

You know.
something that I think I've realized...

1696
01:16:07.693 --> 01:16:10.779
on this trip is that...

1697
01:16:10.863 --> 01:16:13.115
life really doesn't mean anything

1698
01:16:13.198 --> 01:16:18.412
if you don't have people next to you
on the journey with you.

1699
01:16:18.495 --> 01:16:23.625
And it's easy for me to put work
before anything else.

01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:26.003

1701
01:16:32.301 --> 01:16:35.596
I cannot express enough

1702
01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:38.098

1703
01:16:39.099 --> 01:16:42.019

1704
01:16:42.102 --> 01:16:45.314
knowing that you're guarded.
knowing that you have this wall up.

1705
01:16:45.397 --> 01:16:47.107
And for me. that's amazing.

1706
01:16:51.278 --> 01:16:53.447
- But it's scary.
- I know.

1707
01:16:53.530 --> 01:16:55.991

How do you feel
about our conversation from the winery?

1743
01:20:40.674 --> 01:20:43.844
It was a... it was a lot.

1744
01:20:44.928 --> 01:20:46.680
But...

1745
01:20:46.763 --> 01:20:48.640
forget whatever's in the past.

1746
01:20:48.724 --> 01:20:50.517
I don't...
I don't care about that. I just...

1747
01:20:50.601 --> 01:20:52.936
I want to see where this can go.

1748
01:20:53.979 --> 01:20:55.731
I love that.

1749
01:20:55.814 --> 01:20:58.233
I was scared coming here.

1750
01:20:58.317 --> 01:21:00.861
I didn't know how Rome was going to be.

1751
01:21:00.944 --> 01:21:05.490
And I didn't think I was going
to meet someone I liked so much.

1752
01:21:05.574 --> 01:21:09.745
Obviously.
turning 35 is such a big deal for me.

1753
01:21:09.828 --> 01:21:14.458
And I've had extreme pressure from my mom.

1754
01:21:14.541 --> 01:21:17.252
Knowing that she feels like
I'm not going to find anybody.

1755
01:21:17.336 --> 01:21:19.338
you know. it's been really tough.

1756
01:21:19.421 --> 01:21:22.716
but obviously.
I found someone I really like.

1757
01:21:22.799 --> 01:21:24.885
and I never expected that.

1758
01:21:25.969 --> 01:21:29.306
Through being here.
it's almost been surreal.

1759
01:21:29.389 --> 01:21:32.017
I mean. I haven't been
in a relationship in a long time. and

1760
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.478
have been somewhat of a pessimist
that I would ever find that again.

1761
01:21:34.561 --> 01:21:38.190
So the fact that on somewhat of a whim
and being out here

1762
01:21:38.273 --> 01:21:41.527
hopelessly looking for love
that I found it is unbelievable.

1763
01:21:44.321 --> 01:21:46.198
I'm happy to hear you say that because

1764
01:21:46.281 --> 01:21:50.369
I've never introduced somebody
to my parents before.

1765
