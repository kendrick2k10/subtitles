00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:23.815
I could. easy.

181
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.818
My Dad taught me shooting.

182
00:16:26.853 --> 00:16:30.459
He can shoot seal when they're
just tiny dots way off.

183
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.700
- Thought so.
- Shut up!

184
00:16:40.735 --> 00:16:43.076
- Let me shoot. then.
- As if.

185
00:16:43.111 --> 00:16:44.902
Don't be such a wimp about it.

186
00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:47.245
Look. I don't got all the
bullets in the world

187
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.005
for you to be blasting off
everywhere.

188
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.040
Yeah. little miss John McClane.

189
00:16:51.075 --> 00:16:52.778

190
00:16:52.813 --> 00:16:55.583
- - Oh my God.

191

- Hey. Hey!

192
00:16:57.983 --> 00:16:59.851
- It's not fair
that other people can't shoot

193
00:16:59.886 --> 00:17:01.259
'cause you're a chicken.

194
00:17:01.294 --> 00:17:03.888

what's fair.

That was so scary.
I thought you were dead.

00:18:58.708 --> 00:19:00.246
Aju. are you hurt?

233
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.030
Wash this gunk off.

234
00:19:28.034 --> 00:19:29.473
It's not coming off.

235
00:19:31.543 --> 00:19:33.939
See how it moved?
It didn't move right.

236
00:19:33.974 --> 00:19:35.842
And its blood was black.

237
00:19:35.877 --> 00:19:38.845
And its face was messed!
Like. dead.

238
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.177
Maybe it was just effed up with
rabies or something.

239
00:19:41.212 --> 00:19:44.290
Uh-uh. that's not what effed up
with rabies looks like.

240

Ijiraq.

257
00:21:17.308 --> 00:21:18.648
Ijiraq tried to take me?

258
00:21:18.683 --> 00:21:20.881
It was not Ijiraq. Don't even.

259
00:21:20.916 --> 00:21:22.278
What was it then?

260
00:21:22.313 --> 00:21:24.181
It was just an effed up bear.

261
00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:25.853
What makes an Ijiraq?

262
00:21:25.888 --> 00:21:27.525
Shape-shifting.
children stealing.

263
00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.823
What did this thing do?

264
00:21:28.858 --> 00:21:30.462
Pretend to be a bear
and steal Aju.

265
00:21:30.497 --> 00:21:32.365
Ijiraq.

266
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.796
That's Inuk nonsense.

267
00:21:34.831 --> 00:21:38.228
There's no Ijiraq. no Sedna.
and no Qalupalik.

268

00:21:43.334 --> 00:21:45.169
What's an Ijiraq?

271
00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:48.744
Ijiraq are things that live
in two worlds.

272
00:21:48.779 --> 00:21:50.581
Two worlds?

273
00:21:50.616 --> 00:21:53.045
If you go far enough north.
there's a whole other world.

274
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.422
If you go far enough north.
you'll start going south.

275
00:21:58.624 --> 00:22:00.492
When Ijiraq comes to our world.

276
00:22:00.527 --> 00:22:02.890
they can disguise themselves
as anything.

277
00:22:02.925 --> 00:22:04.859
and when they do.
they snatch children

278
00:22:04.894 --> 00:22:06.256
and bring them back
to their world.

279
00:22:06.291 --> 00:22:07.895
Why do they take children?

280
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.833

it's dumb Inuk stuff.

281

fall for it now.

282
00:22:14.607 --> 00:22:16.409
You think you know all that.
but it's only people

283
00:22:16.444 --> 00:22:20.006

really don't know anything.

284
00:22:20.041 --> 00:22:21.843
Ask your Ataata. he'll tell you.

Feel free to shut up
about my dad.

287
00:22:27.114 --> 00:22:29.884
Hey. since you know so much

288
00:22:29.919 --> 00:22:31.886
and you're such a good little
Inuk anyway.

289
00:22:31.921 --> 00:22:33.888
why don't you go out there and
hunt that thing

290
00:22:33.923 --> 00:22:36.429
with all your great skills?

291
00:22:36.464 --> 00:22:40.466
Then you can come back and prove
us all wrong.

292
00:22:40.501 --> 00:22:42.831
Seriously. I dare you.
Go out there.

293

smell their own blood.

659
00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:24.054
Which are super sharp.
and they suck up blood

660
00:55:24.089 --> 00:55:26.661
to use as fuel for their
liver ship.

661
00:55:26.696 --> 00:55:29.059
Maybe they also need blood
for their own power?

662
00:55:29.094 --> 00:55:32.062
They might want our blood too.

663
00:55:32.097 --> 00:55:34.405

Dummies. think they're tricky.

671
00:55:54.625 --> 00:55:57.791
And then they run really fast
and really strong.

672
00:55:57.826 --> 00:55:59.859
But I think they get tired.

673
00:55:59.894 --> 00:56:01.432
Like. maybe if they don't have
enough blood.

674
00:56:01.467 --> 00:56:04.567
they can only be fast and strong
for short bits.

675
00:56:12.577 --> 00:56:14.104
They must be strong by now.

676
00:56:14.139 --> 00:56:16.909

of Peter's blood.

677
00:56:18.913 --> 00:56:21.309
Girl. you know a lot.

678
00:56:21.344 --> 00:56:23.113

699
00:57:35.517 --> 00:57:38.452
So how are we gonna do this?

700
00:57:38.487 --> 00:57:41.565

What?

705

Do you carry that around. like.
