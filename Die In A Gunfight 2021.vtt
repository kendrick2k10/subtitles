4
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.584
Since the age of five.

5
00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:51.257
Ben gibbon had been in 723 scrapes.
scuffles and brawls.

6
00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:54.801
An approximate 32.86 per year.

7
00:00:55.806 --> 00:00:59.094
And he lost every single one.

8
00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:01.433
With a record like that.

9
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.684
his therapist determined
that he was actually trying to lose.

10
00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:09.983
and in truth. for Ben.
winning was never the point.

11
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.983
It was more like a nagging sensation

12
00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:16.778
that he was floating
around inside his own brain.

13
00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:20.702
watching his life like it was a movie
where nothing happened.

14
00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:24.540
He could see it. but he couldn't feel it.

15
00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:29.336
So he was left with a violent need
to feel something.

16
00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:30.833
- Hey!
- Anything.

17
00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.664
Detached from reality

18
00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.841
and a captive audience
of his own movie.

19
00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.419
Ben searched out
increasingly disruptive ways

20
00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:39.721
of at least making it a crowd-pleaser.

21
00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:44.177
It was an aimless search.
rife with conflict and self-abasement.

22
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:47.354
Until. without ever really knowing
what he was looking for.

23
00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:49.723
he found love.

24
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.521
Holy shit.

25
00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:55.901
All at once. Ben's world came alive

26
00:01:56.033 --> 00:02:00.276
and he felt his life with an immediacy
he never thought possible.

27
00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:07.954
But then. just as suddenly
as it had appeared.

28
00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:09.831
it was gone.

29
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.912
Jj

30
00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:29.980
And just like that.

31
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:33.059
Ben found himself
right back where he started.

32
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.832
Stay down. bitch.

33
00:02:58.428 --> 00:02:59.588
One moment.

34
00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.138
Mm.

35
00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.230
Oh. fuck. fellas.

36
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:19.237
Still beating.

37
00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:20.324
Son of a...

38
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.062
Why are we going to this. again?

39
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.310
It's gonna be fun.

40
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.321
It will not be fun.

41
00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:06.072
You sure it's not
because you heard she's back?

42
00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:07.528
I doubt she'll be there.

43
00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:12.953
It's her house.

44
00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.423
We're not even invited
to this thing. are we?

45
00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:29.518
Nope.

46
00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.185
Mukul's concern was justified.

47
00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:35.772
as Ben had a reputation
for terrorizing high society events.

48
00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.437
In fact. after a recent string
of flagrant infractions.

49
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.648
a newly minted restraining order
made the point loud and clear.

50
00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:49.612
Ben gibbon was very much not welcome.

51
00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.697
Jj

52
00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.637
- Uh. mom's coming.
- Benjamin.

53
00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.965
- Oh. my god. What are you doing here?
- Hey. mom.

54
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.346
Free booze. Thank you. perfect timing.

55
00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.348
- Thank you.
- Come with me.

56
00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.725
You do realize that you
were banned from these events.

57
00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:18.432
Ma. it's water under the bridge.

58
00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:20.129
You punched the president
of the exeter club.

59
00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.860
- urinated on the carpet.
- Yeah. yeah. We get it. we get it.

60
00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:25.360
Why can't you keep him
under control. mukul?

61
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.736
Your son's an anarchist. Mrs. gibbon.

62
00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:30.069
- He's a democrat.
- What's that?

63
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.404
Uh. mom. they're bruises.
they don't come off.

64
00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:33.830
Have you two been smoking dope?

65
00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:34.827
- Yeah.
- No.

66
00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:36.278
- Son.
- There's your father.

67
00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.997
- Batman.
- That's the man.

68
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.671
What? It's really good.

69
00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:45.626
Mm-hmm. If William
and Beatrice see him here.

70
00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.969
it's gonna make an already
uncomfortable situation...

71
00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.089
My eyes must be deceiving me.

72
00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.218
Not much for appearances. are we?

73
00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:57.429
Just a little scuffle.
you know how boys are.

74
00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.355
That's not the point.

75
00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.649
Your son is trespassing.

76
00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:06.025
I'll keep a close eye on him and he's
going to behave himself. Right. Benjamin?

77
00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.072
Hmm?

78
00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:13.449
Thank you.

79
00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:15.413
Do I need
to call the authorities?

80
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.872
Can you try to not look so miserable?

81
00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.336
The city's most eligible bachelors
are here tonight

82
00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.422
and you're sitting in the corner.

83
00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.757
Humor me. Make an effort.

84
00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:37.515
I don't want everyone talking about how
my daughter looked miserable all night.

85
00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:45.068
Mary rathcart first upset
her parents' lofty expectations

86
00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:47.567
when. at the age of 12.

87
00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:51.320
she was expelled from the city's
most prestigious private school.

88
00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.194
By the time she was 16.

89
00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:57.949
she had been kicked out
of every private school in town.

90
00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.910
But she finally went too far

91
00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:03.245
when she fell for Benjamin gibbon.

92
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.049
the notorious son
of her father's bitter rival.

93
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:10.127
When the news broke.
it was an instant scandal

94
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:14.806
and she was strictly forbidden
from seeing the gibbon boy ever again.

95
00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:18.932
which. as far as Mary was concerned.
simply wasn't an option.

96
00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:23.356
So she made a secret plan
to abscond with Ben to Mexico.

97
00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.230
But their plan was soon thwarted

98
00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:30.072
and Mary was abruptly shipped off
to boarding school in Paris.

99
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.320
where her talents would be cultivated
in a more regimented environment.

100
00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.699
Mary wrote Ben many times.

101
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.373
first to say...

102
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.951
- I miss you.
- Then to ask...

103
00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:45.708
Did you forget me?

104
00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.568
- Then simply...
- Fuck youl!

105
00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:50.208
But for reasons
Mary couldn't fathom.

106
00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.385
Ben never wrote back.

107
00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.963
And so she never wrote again.

108
00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:59.973
She did her best to forget about Ben
and forget the world she left behind.

109
00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:04.146
She remained in Paris
to study at the sorbonne

110
00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:07.146
and committed herself
to a brand new life.

111
00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:10.650
but her heart remained fraught.

112
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.951
plagued by a chronic loneliness
she simply couldn't shake.

113
00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:18.119
And yet her overbearing father

114
00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.993
made sure she was
always closely watched.

115
00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:24.042
so she was never
quite as alone as she felt.

116
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.999
In the end. time doused
what fire was left in her

117
00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:33.836
and like a domesticated bird
seeking the comfort of the cage.

118
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:38.014
she returned home. weary and humbled.

119
00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:41.264
right back where she started.

120
00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.640
I said. "see him out.”

121
00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:45.973
Benjamin was already leaving. William.

122
00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:49.894
What? Do you have something to say?

123
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.230
Just wanted to show face.

124
00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:57.408
Why don't you throw a steak on that eye?
You look like a goddamn criminal.

125
00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.370
For generations. the gibbon
and rathcart families

126
00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:04.120
had stood in staunch
opposition of one another.

127
00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:07.460
One might even go as far
as to call it a "blood feud.”

128
00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:11.005
and like all blood feuds.

129
00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:12.965
it began with a bit of blood.

130
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.544
The year was 1864.

131
00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.674
Tarleton rathcart
and Theodore gibbon.

132
00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:21.805
both powerful figures in New York City's
burgeoning news industry.

133
00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:25.012
met as gentlemen duelers
after an unflattering story

134
00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:29.315
was run in Theodore's paper
in regards to tarleton's shoes.

135
00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:31.400
Theodore fell to tarleton's bullet.

136
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.479
uttering the dying words...

137
00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:38.655
Tell that cheating bastard rathcart
I'l see him in hell.

138
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.286
Over the years.
both families' publications

139
00:09:42.373 --> 00:09:45.490
grew steadily into opposing media
conglomerates

140
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:49.077
known today as
gibbon telecommunications

141
00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:51.003
and the rathcart corporation.

142
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.753
and the dueling continued.

143
00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:57.506
One could easily call it the most
combative media rivalry in history.

144
00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:00.304
but for Henry gibbon
and William rathcart.

145
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:04.509
it was never about business...
It was personal.

146
00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:12.355
Excuse us. Come. son.

147
00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:20.116
You're a grown man.

148
00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:21.784
It's time you act like it.

149
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.040
(Get out.

150
00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:27.116
Jj

151
00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.123
What was that all about?

152
00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:33.375
William was a little harsh. wasn't he?

153
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.047
Mary's back.

154
00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.722
Bro. the coats.

155
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:54.142
Hmm.

156
00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.862
Okay.

157
00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:00.406
Security!

158
00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.221
- Oh. my god!
- Hey. you got it?

159
00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:03.735
Go. go. go. go. go!

160
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.537
He stole the coats again.

161
00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.240
Walter.
that's my coat! Stop him!

162
00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.834
Gibbon!

163
00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.830
Jj

164
00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:22.254
Mary's exile to Paris
was conducted swiftly and without warning.

165
00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:27.676
He called and texted.
but was hever answered.

166
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.682
He emailed.
but received no response.

167
00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:37.193
Mary's whereabouts and her silence
remained a haunting mystery

168
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.115
until Ben happened across a gossip story
detailing her exploits in Paris.

169
00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:48.197
Heartbroken. Ben used the one-way ticket
he had hoped to use with Mary

170
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:51.579
and disappeared
to Mexico unannounced.

171
00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.751
with no intention of returning.

172
00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:58.127
His only attempt to communicate
his dire existential intentions

173
00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:01.335
was a cryptic letter
sent to his mother and father.

174
00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:15.141
He returned seven months later
in the company of mukul.

175
00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.896
Having sworn an oath of secrecy.

176
00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:19.227
neither of them ever
spoke a word of how they met.

177
00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:23.235
but they had been
inseparable ever since.

178
00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:26.318
Jj

179
00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:24.293
Jj

180
00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.969
You know. I just can't stomach this.

181
00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:30.799
After all these years. you'd think even
that kid would find a way to grow up.

182
00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:32.724
Henry's gonna have
to write a check this time.

183
00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.723
It's best to not get embroiled. darling.

184
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:36.395
He does this kind of thing often?

185
00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:39.144
Whenever he decides to show his face.

186
00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:41.442
Oh. I know that look. Mary.

187
00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:44.817
- Shall I pull out the scrapbook?
- No. please. don't.

188
00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:48.900
You know. most parents keep
a record of their kids' achievements.

189
00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.610
not their failures. It's weird.

190
00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:53.822
My mother always said. "there's no greater
teacher than shame."

191
00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:57.075
Don't be dramatic. It's funny.

192
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.690
I wouldn't wish him on my worst enemy.

193
00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:02.668
Third grade report card.
Flabbergasting precociousness.

194
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.624
The boy is
properly sick in the head.

195
00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:06.251
Turned down the family fortune.

196
00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.257
- He did?
- Oh. I love this one.

197
00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.838
You remember Felix Graham?

198
00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:11.968
He had a few sessions
with him some years back.

199
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:13.807
Pathological contrariness.

200
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.385
Said he had a screw loose.

201
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.391
- Oh. this is classic.
- Point taken.

202
00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:20.770
He said he had some kind
of death wish taking all those beatings.

203
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.567
Imagine a kid
getting a diagnosis like that.

204
00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:25.315
- A death wish?
- Enough!

205
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:27.192
Ben gibbon is in the past.

206
00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.319
just like all of these
other regrettable decisions.

207
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.698
And you being home doesn't change
anything. Am I understood?

208
00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:34.620
Mary knew that a prerequisite

209
00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.035
for being back home
under her parents' roof

210
00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:40.118
was maintaining
a quietly obedient exterior.

211
00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:44.797
Fuck!

212
00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:49.471
Mary.

213
00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:52.171
Something to say?

214
00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:55.519
No.

215
00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:13.472
The young male gibbon

216
00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:16.579
will now challenge the dominant male
for control of the family.

217
00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.828
If the adolescent continues his challenge.

218
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.661
the dominant male will respond
with a violent attack..

219
00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:28.083
Forcing the young gibbon to strike off
oh its own in search of a mate.

220
00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:42.806
Jj

221
00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:47.404
Hmm.

222
00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.883
- Hey. strangers!
- Cheers.

223
00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:18.098
- Oh. my god!
- Lily.

224
00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:19.842
- Finally.
- You're back. wow!

225
00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:22.269
- Oh my god. shots!
- She's here.

226
00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:23.934
- Cheers.
- Oh.

227
00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:26.148
- We'll keep 'em going.
- What's going on?

228
00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:27.725
I have to dance.

229
00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:31.312
What are we forgetting?

230
00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:34.774
Oh. god. Everything.

231
00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:37.861
Jj

232
00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:04.812
On!

233
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.350
- Terrence.
- Peekaboo.

234
00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:12.437
What are you doing here?

235
00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:15.606
I missed you.

236
00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:18.693
- How did you know I was here?
- Come with me.

237
00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:22.121
I got us a private room. so we can talk
away from these animals.

238
00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:23.789
Terrence.

239
00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:38.094
You followed me here. didn't you?

240
00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:39.888
It would appear that way.

241
00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:43.639
Well. that's not your job anymore.
so you need to stop doing it.

242
00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:47.973
Jj

243
00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:54.778
Mary.

244
00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:01.786
I recall the good times
we shared together.

245
00:18:01.872 --> 00:18:04.079
The romantic nights.

246
00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:10.836
Look at this little lost soul. doll.

247
00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:18.920
I think he's cute.

248
00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.255
Oh.

249
00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.007
My wife thinks you're cute.

250
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.305
Like a rabbit.

251
00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:34.773
Why don't you go over there and play
with the new pet rabbit. huh?

252
00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:36.354
Go on. have fun.

253
00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:50.751
Hey. rabbit. you know what I've always
thought would be a cool way to die?

254
00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:53.417
Shark attack.

255
00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:55.088
A big fish

256
00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:59.465
with big. bloody
razor-sharp teeth eating you.

257
00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.552
There he is.

258
00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:06.558
Oh. here he comes.

259
00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:16.561
Yeah. see. the point is. mate.
we're all running round. right?

260
00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.863
Like we're too special to get eaten
by a bloody shark.

261
00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:20.405
But we're not. right?

262
00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:23.280
We're just monkeys. Monkeys in suits.

263
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.327
We are just little bloody mascots

264
00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:28.531
for the great.
big organ grinder in the sky.

265
00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.582
So. rabbit. how do you wanna die?

266
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:41.297
Jj

267
00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:48.051
I wanna die in a gunfight.

268
00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:53.397
Die in a gunfight? You hear that. doll?

269
00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:56.942
Here we was. just thinking
you were a scared little baby rabbit.

270
00:19:58.698 --> 00:19:59.733
Jesus. mate.

271
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:02.823
Look what you've gone and done.

272
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.446
It's true what they say. I guess.

273
00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:06.443
Every bird likes a bad boy.

274
00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:09.059
How old are you.
you rascally little wabbit?

275
00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:10.083
I'm 27.

276
00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:12.162
Bullshit. mate. I don't believe you.

277
00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:15.878
- I wanna see some identification. please.
- Guys.

278
00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:18.206
Where are you bloody going. mate?
Sit. sit. sit. sit.

279
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.009
Come on. hand it over.
Come on. You're not under arrest yet.

280
00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:26.922
Checks out. Have a look at that. doll.

281
00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:29.008
It's a lot of fun.
but I have to get going.

282
00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:31.264
- Oh. no.
- Rabbit!

283
00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:34.346
We're just getting started here. mate.

284
00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:38.230
After everything
that we've been through together.

285
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.652
I wouldn't have thought
that you'd be ashamed of me.

286
00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:42.487
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

287
00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:45.278
Good.

288
00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:48.987
Because I think the feelings...

289
00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:53.457
Our feelings. are still there.

290
00:20:53.544 --> 00:20:55.159
There were never any feelings.

291
00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:57.172
Mm.

292
00:20:58.174 --> 00:20:59.505
Terrence.

293
00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:06.629
That was then.

294
00:21:06.724 --> 00:21:08.339
This is fucking now.

295
00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:10.846
- What are you doing?
- Mary. I love you.

296
00:21:10.978 --> 00:21:13.594
- Terrence. please. I don't love you.
- Mary...

297
00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:15.930
Okay. just... Terrence.

298
00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:19.934
- What is that?
- Our logical conclusion.

299
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:22.896
Are you insane?

300
00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:24.863
Terrence. just go.

301
00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.162
Terrence. just go.

302
00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:34.706
Mary. come on.

303
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.411
Terrence. please. just go away.

304
00:21:39.673 --> 00:21:41.880
Hey. Barb. you wanna dance with rabbit?

305
00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:44.128
She's a really good dancer.

306
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.552
No. Like I said.
I have to get going.

307
00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:50.385
I said dance.

308
00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:52.883
What's up. doc?

309
00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:56.178
Whoo!

310
00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:58.229
She is my shining angel.

311
00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:01.809
And if my shining angel wants to dance.

312
00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:04.145
then she's gonna
bloody well dance. mate.

313
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.400
Isn't that right. hon?

314
00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:07.903
Sure is. sugar pie.

315
00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.654
Look at this. mate.

316
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:14.743
Two halves make a whole.

317
00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:17.161
- I love you. baby.
- I love you.

318
00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:24.419
You wouldn't wanna hurt my angel's
feelings now. would you. wabbit?

319
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.626
No. but like I said. I have to get going.

320
00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:30.425
Here I am.
thinking that you're a big grown rabbit.

321
00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:32.513
Maybe I'm wrong.

322
00:22:33.602 --> 00:22:35.513
Maybe you're just a pussy.

323
00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:38.061
Oh. come on now. grizzly. be nice.

324
00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:41.106
Oh. well. I didn't wear these dancing
shoes for nothing. hon.

325
00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:47.275
So what's it gonna be mate. hmm?

326
00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:49.448
You a rabbit?

327
00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:52.408
Or a pussy?

328
00:22:53.414 --> 00:22:55.279
All right. enough.

329
00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:56.284
On.

330
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:59.412
You're either gonna let me out.
or I'm gonna make you let me.

331
00:22:59.503 --> 00:23:02.119
Look at this. doll. huh?

332
00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:06.298
Looks like me and rabbit
are gonna dance.

333
00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:08.171
What. we gonna do the waltz?

334
00:23:08.262 --> 00:23:10.844
We're gonna have a little bloody melee.

335
00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:14.848
Give it everything you got. mate.

336
00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:19.220
Jj

337
00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:44.120
Jj

338
00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:46.317
Hi.

339
00:24:50.114 --> 00:24:51.114
Hi.

340
00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:56.817
So this is your place?

341
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.786
I own it. yeah.

342
00:25:02.418 --> 00:25:04.249
You bought this apartment?

343
00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:05.826
Yeah. I did.

344
00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:09.209
And the entire building around it.

345
00:25:10.884 --> 00:25:12.465
How?

346
00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:15.427
Word on the street
is you're poor on purpose.

347
00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:17.175
It's kind of a long story.

348
00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:19.764
Okay.

349
00:25:32.698 --> 00:25:34.313
Care to elaborate?

350
00:25:35.826 --> 00:25:37.782
Mukul and I took an oath of secrecy.

351
00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:45.786
Why didn't you write?

352
00:25:51.008 --> 00:25:52.464
Why did you leave?

353
00:25:54.845 --> 00:25:56.881
You should wash this blood off.

354
00:26:06.482 --> 00:26:07.972
Pamela corbett-ragsdale.

355
00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:11.230
a former research and development
executive for rathcart computers

356
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.404
will be sitting down with our own
Alan Gregory tomorrow night

357
00:26:15.491 --> 00:26:18.073
in an exclusive live interview.

358
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.991
Corbett-ragsdale will be discussing

359
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.580
the alleged internal memos
circulated within rathcart corporation

360
00:26:24.666 --> 00:26:27.829
requiring employees
of rathcart computers

361
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.502
fo sign a non-disclosure agreement

362
00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:32.830
concerning a secretive program

363
00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:34.665
called "info net."

364
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:39.129
Up next. murder mystery.
That story. coming up next.

365
00:26:39.223 --> 00:26:41.965
When a desperate
William rathcart came to Terrence uberahl

366
00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:46.018
asking him to handle his potentially
devastating whistleblower problem.

367
00:26:46.105 --> 00:26:49.597
Terrence was elated.
certain that a job well done

368
00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:53.183
was his ticket to securing
Mary's hand in marriage.

369
00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.154
So he made arrangements with the best
contract killer in the business.

370
00:26:57.241 --> 00:26:59.094
What's the status
on corbett-ragsdale?

371
00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:01.200
She checked into the Plaza
this morning. sir.

372
00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:03.277
- And?
- And you have nothing to worry about.

373
00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:07.869
I'm loyal to you. William.
and to the corporation.

374
00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.249
I feel very much like part of the family.

375
00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:15.797
Well. your father and I
were like brothers. You're like a son.

376
00:27:15.884 --> 00:27:18.216
My sentiments exactly.

377
00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:22.509
What if I could be...
More than like a son?

378
00:27:24.685 --> 00:27:26.767
Mary and I became very close

379
00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:30.228
while I was keeping an eye on her
for you in Paris.

380
00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:34.479
I recall you blew your cover.
put yourself at her mercy.

381
00:27:35.904 --> 00:27:38.236
I took my job of protecting her
very seriously

382
00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:39.923
and I'd like to continue protecting her.

383
00:27:39.992 --> 00:27:42.699
Yeah? In what capacity?

384
00:27:42.786 --> 00:27:44.322
As her husband.

385
00:27:49.042 --> 00:27:51.249
I proposed last night. sir.

386
00:27:53.422 --> 00:27:55.413
If you approve. of course.

387
00:27:59.428 --> 00:28:00.838
I'll make you a deal.

388
00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:04.592
You take care of my problem.
I'll Grant you my daughter's hand.

389
00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:08.096
Just one thing.

390
00:28:08.187 --> 00:28:10.303
Not with ragsdale. sir. with Mary.

391
00:28:11.398 --> 00:28:13.434
I put a few of my men on her
just to be safe

392
00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:15.766
and they informed me that
she spent the night last night

393
00:28:15.861 --> 00:28:18.694
with... Benjamin gibbon.

394
00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:21.908
- I thought you said you proposed to her.
- I did.

395
00:28:21.992 --> 00:28:24.779
She just hasn't said "yes" yet.
hence the problem.

396
00:28:24.912 --> 00:28:26.448
How would you like me to proceed?

397
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.289
How about you stop being a pussy
and just put the fear of god in him?

398
00:28:31.293 --> 00:28:32.408
Yes. sir.

399
00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:46.638
Mary said goodbye. Seems nice.

400
00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:57.270
Don't look at me like that.

401
00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:04.318
Time to go.

402
00:29:05.827 --> 00:29:09.319
You don't want to be late
for your mom's brunch. hmm?

403
00:29:10.499 --> 00:29:13.491
Jj

404
00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:22.718
Ahem.

405
00:29:52.582 --> 00:29:54.322
Mary rathcart?

406
00:29:56.878 --> 00:29:58.869
Ben gibbon.

407
00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:05.000
Do I need to explain to you
why this is unacceptable?

408
00:30:06.513 --> 00:30:07.878
Who told you that?

409
00:30:09.558 --> 00:30:11.558
We've always had
such high hopes for you.

410
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.556
But you continually disappoint us.

411
00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:18.514
- I'm sorry. I don't mean to continue...
- To what. Mary?

412
00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:21.896
Help the boy's father drag my fucking name
through the mud?

413
00:30:24.906 --> 00:30:26.737
I'm not sure he needs my help.

414
00:30:27.743 --> 00:30:29.153
My god. you need a leash.

415
00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:30.700
- William.
- Ah!

416
00:30:30.787 --> 00:30:32.527
The rathcarts have been running
their empire

417
00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:36.490
like a criminal organization
for generations.

418
00:30:36.585 --> 00:30:40.328
but this rathcart scandal
is a unique opportunity.

419
00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:43.835
It's my chance to end it.

420
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:48.093
But how can I do that

421
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.593
when my son is photographed
cavorting with the man's daughter?

422
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:54.512
That drags us into it.

423
00:30:54.603 --> 00:30:57.561
It clouds the issue.
just when I need things to be...

424
00:31:05.364 --> 00:31:07.730
Sorry. dad. I'm listening.

425
00:31:08.784 --> 00:31:11.366
Crystal clear.

426
00:31:11.453 --> 00:31:15.366
Thank god Terrence is so willing
to take you off our hands.

427
00:31:15.457 --> 00:31:17.038
- He is?
- Of course he is.

428
00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:23.295
But I thought the two of you
were. . Friends in Paris.

429
00:31:24.841 --> 00:31:27.457
As much as you can be friends
with a fucking stalker.

430
00:31:29.596 --> 00:31:32.679
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer. right. dad?

431
00:31:32.766 --> 00:31:34.757
Jj

432
00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:44.106
I love the choice of music. Mrs. gibbon.

433
00:31:45.112 --> 00:31:46.727
Thank you. mukul.

434
00:31:46.822 --> 00:31:49.564
Do you guys know
what Beethoven's last words were?

435
00:31:49.658 --> 00:31:52.900
"Plaudite. amici. comedia finita est.”

436
00:31:52.994 --> 00:31:54.200
"Friends. applaud.

437
00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:56.570
The comedy is finished."

438
00:31:56.665 --> 00:31:59.202
Goddamn it! I've had enough!

439
00:32:00.335 --> 00:32:02.417
All you had to do was play ball

440
00:32:02.504 --> 00:32:04.460
and all of this would have been yours.

441
00:32:04.548 --> 00:32:07.540
I appreciate the offer. dad.
but I'd rather play with my own balls.

442
00:32:08.885 --> 00:32:13.379
And what will you do when whatever it is
you're living on runs out. hmm?

443
00:32:13.473 --> 00:32:15.429
Please. enlighten us.

444
00:32:15.517 --> 00:32:19.351
You know. I've been really putting
a lot of thought into it.

445
00:32:29.364 --> 00:32:30.364
Fishing.

446
00:32:31.366 --> 00:32:33.197
I think I'll be a fisherman.

447
00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:36.243
And mukul here will
be my first mate. right?

448
00:32:37.831 --> 00:32:39.992
He takes after you. You know that?

449
00:32:41.126 --> 00:32:45.165
This family needs to present
a unified front and we need a distraction.

450
00:32:46.256 --> 00:32:47.962
So I should marry a man I don't love?

451
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:49.209
Oh. Jesus Christ.

452
00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:53.795
Your entire life. you have lived
off the spoils of your bloodline.

453
00:32:53.889 --> 00:32:56.050
Yes. now comes the reckoning!

454
00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:59.725
So for once you will do as I say!

455
00:33:02.314 --> 00:33:05.306
I worked my entire life
to build my reputation

456
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:11.566
and I am entirely unwilling to let you
and your Rasputin ruin it.

457
00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:13.926
No. no. no. no. no. Mukul is my
very good friend and our guest.

458
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:15.030
I eave him out of this.

459
00:33:15.118 --> 00:33:18.030
Don't you think we're taking this
a bit far. boys?

460
00:33:18.121 --> 00:33:22.490
You fight. you steal.
you drink. you're a disgrace.

461
00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:28.370
Do you hear me?

462
00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:31.255
Henry.

463
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.260
Do you hear me?

464
00:33:34.596 --> 00:33:35.881
I hear you.

465
00:33:35.972 --> 00:33:38.554
Your name may be gibbon...

466
00:33:38.642 --> 00:33:42.180
- And?
- And it's bullshit.

467
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.636
But you're not fit for this family.

468
00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:46.062
And I'm not putting up with it.

469
00:33:47.609 --> 00:33:50.897
- Hey!
- You wanna act like a goddamn animal?

470
00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:52.193
There is your cage!

471
00:33:53.532 --> 00:33:55.523
Jj

472
00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:04.197
Okay.

473
00:34:19.558 --> 00:34:20.558
Benjamin.

474
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.515
You're excused.

475
00:34:33.947 --> 00:34:35.733
Sorry. mom.

476
00:34:38.326 --> 00:34:41.784
I am. I'm sorry.

477
00:34:43.498 --> 00:34:44.658
Go.

478
00:34:46.418 --> 00:34:47.703
Just go. Ben.

479
00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:01.679
I apologize if I played any part

480
00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:06.180
in ruining your lovely mother's day
celebration. Mrs. gibbon.

481
00:35:14.696 --> 00:35:15.696
Hmm.

482
00:35:18.366 --> 00:35:19.366
Mm-hmm.

483
00:35:22.912 --> 00:35:26.655
Later that night.
alone in their respective rooms.

484
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:30.993
Mary and Ben found themselves doing
what many of us tend to do

485
00:35:31.087 --> 00:35:32.418
when we're feeling forlorn.

486
00:35:33.423 --> 00:35:36.256
They were contemplating
the events of the past...

487
00:35:36.343 --> 00:35:40.632
The precious highs.
the devastating lows.

488
00:35:40.722 --> 00:35:45.136
and the choices they had made
or failed to make in between.

489
00:35:45.226 --> 00:35:48.889
all of which. when added up.
had led them right here...

490
00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:52.772
To this very moment.

491
00:35:52.901 --> 00:35:57.144
They felt haunted by a suspicion

492
00:35:57.238 --> 00:36:01.857
that history was somehow repeating itself.

493
00:36:10.877 --> 00:36:13.493
And so each in their own way.

494
00:36:13.588 --> 00:36:16.421
they resolved to throw caution to the wind

495
00:36:16.549 --> 00:36:20.417
and do something quite different
this time around.

496
00:36:23.264 --> 00:36:26.256
Jj

497
00:36:34.984 --> 00:36:36.849
Shh. shh! Hey. hey. hey.

498
00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:40.108
- Shh. shh!
- What are you doing here?

499
00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:47.778
Why are you always leaving. huh?

500
00:36:49.374 --> 00:36:50.580
What?

501
00:36:53.086 --> 00:36:55.793
I don't know.
I... I can't be here anymore.

502
00:36:59.801 --> 00:37:03.669
Mary. we're at the age where it's
pretty much time to conform or die.

503
00:37:03.763 --> 00:37:06.004
We grew up thinking
we're gonna be something special

504
00:37:06.099 --> 00:37:08.556
and do something heroic
with our lives. you know.

505
00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:12.056
and they let us live in that fantasy
for 20-something years.

506
00:37:12.147 --> 00:37:13.933
And then what?

507
00:37:14.023 --> 00:37:17.390
We're just supposed to surrender
and grow up. live with the heartbreak

508
00:37:17.485 --> 00:37:20.602
that our lives were never meant to be
as great as we thought they'd be.

509
00:37:23.992 --> 00:37:26.108
Honestly. I'd rather die.

510
00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:32.492
What if there's another way?

511
00:37:35.545 --> 00:37:38.537
What if greatness for me...

512
00:37:42.635 --> 00:37:43.841
Is loving you?

513
00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:48.634
Loving you perfectly. and fuck the rest.

514
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.970
I can live with that. you know.

515
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:59.432
I'm pretty sure
that kind of love never dies.

516
00:37:59.527 --> 00:38:01.518
Jj

517
00:38:13.792 --> 00:38:15.453
Mary.

518
00:38:17.796 --> 00:38:18.796
Fuck it.

519
00:38:19.798 --> 00:38:20.798
Fuck it.

520
00:38:25.512 --> 00:38:26.968
You wanna get out of here?

521
00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:28.465
Mary!

522
00:38:29.557 --> 00:38:31.047
We need to talk.

523
00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:54.197
I have an idea. in the interest of this
not being weird.

524
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:57.282
Let's just start over. You know.
pretend we're complete strangers

525
00:38:57.377 --> 00:38:59.663
and it's the first time we've ever met.

526
00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:03.414
- Like a blind date?
- Yeah. exactly.

527
00:39:04.425 --> 00:39:05.665
Okay. then.

528
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.751
So hi. I'm Mary.

529
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:10.970
Oh. you're really excited to meet me.

530
00:39:11.808 --> 00:39:14.515
Hi. Hi. Hi. I'm Mary.

531
00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:17.469
Yeah. okay. great.
Mary. hi. I'm Ben.

532
00:39:17.564 --> 00:39:18.974
- Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you.

533
00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:20.805
Pleasure's all mine.

534
00:39:26.239 --> 00:39:27.445
Now what?

535
00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:32.863
- Do you know who Ken kesey is?
- Of course.

536
00:39:32.954 --> 00:39:36.287
You know. he had this thing where he
always talked about making this movie.

537
00:39:36.416 --> 00:39:39.283
like he was living his life
making this movie.

538
00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:43.962
I always liked that.
I always thought of my life that way.

539
00:39:44.966 --> 00:39:46.797
So am I in your movie now?

540
00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:49.588
You've always been in my movie.

541
00:39:50.597 --> 00:39:52.633
You better watch out.

542
00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:56.057
I studied acting. so I'm gonna be
the star of your movie.

543
00:39:56.144 --> 00:39:59.477
- Hmm.
- But I'm really. really bad at crying.

544
00:39:59.564 --> 00:40:01.625
There was. like. a whole class on how
to cry on command

545
00:40:01.649 --> 00:40:03.981
and I could never do it. Never.

546
00:40:07.488 --> 00:40:09.900
All right. Well. we're gonna need
some backstory.

547
00:40:09.991 --> 00:40:13.483
- Um. may I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.

548
00:40:14.495 --> 00:40:16.156
Who was the guy you
were with last night?

549
00:40:17.498 --> 00:40:20.911
I wasn't with a guy.
He works for my dad.

550
00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:23.664
When I was in Paris.

551
00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:27.714
my dad sent him to keep an eye on me
and I wasn't supposed to know.

552
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.086
And then one morning.
I was having breakfast in a café

553
00:40:30.178 --> 00:40:32.669
and he just sat down
across from me and said...

554
00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:34.880
Good morning. Mary.

555
00:40:34.974 --> 00:40:37.465
I've weighed out my options
before sitting down with you.

556
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.266
They were three in number.

557
00:40:39.354 --> 00:40:41.845
One. maintain the status quo
and keep my distance.

558
00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:44.848
Two. pretend to be a stranger
and take it from there.

559
00:40:44.943 --> 00:40:49.357
Three. just come right out
and hope for the best.

560
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:53.065
And that being said.
I simply can no longer keep my distance.

561
00:40:53.201 --> 00:40:55.317
And honesty is usually the best policy.

562
00:40:55.411 --> 00:40:57.493
so I've decided to go with option three.

563
00:40:59.749 --> 00:41:02.081
That's fascinating.

564
00:41:02.168 --> 00:41:04.955
Mostly. though. I'm wondering who you are.
what you want from me.

565
00:41:05.046 --> 00:41:08.755
and why I shouldn't take this knife
and put it in your fucking eye?

566
00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:14.843
And I work for your father.

567
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.381
Mr. William rathcart.

568
00:41:18.518 --> 00:41:21.305
He has stationed me here
as an invisible agent. so to speak.

569
00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:26.231
I've been charged more precisely
with keeping an eye on you

570
00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:29.775
and stepping in if you were
to invite undue trouble.

571
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.441
Why doesn't that surprise me?

572
00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:36.945
You know. wouldn't it be so much more...

573
00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:42.618
Profitable if I were to come clean
and reveal myself to you?

574
00:41:42.709 --> 00:41:44.311
I mean. after all.
lurking in the background

575
00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:46.997
pales in comparison to being included.

576
00:41:47.088 --> 00:41:48.419
Included?

577
00:41:48.548 --> 00:41:51.415
Well. what I mean is.

578
00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:55.252
you know. I could complete my mission

579
00:41:55.388 --> 00:42:00.428
and report all the details of your comings
and goings to your father or...

580
00:42:03.229 --> 00:42:07.472
You and I could become in cahoots.

581
00:42:07.567 --> 00:42:10.149
And all he'd have to hear is
a bare and unexciting minimum.

582
00:42:12.155 --> 00:42:16.819
And you know. all I'd ask in return
is for you to grace me with your company.

583
00:42:16.909 --> 00:42:19.321
only when you have time. of course.

584
00:42:24.083 --> 00:42:26.449
So you're a double agent. are you?

585
00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:29.536
Mademoiselle. I am merely an agent.

586
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.962
Of what. I have no idea.

587
00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:39.967
I haven't been able to shake him since.

588
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.887
It was kind of like
giving scraps to a stray.

589
00:42:45.313 --> 00:42:47.895
He proposed to me last night with a ring.

590
00:42:47.982 --> 00:42:49.793
Like. he actually went out
and he bought a ring.

591
00:42:49.817 --> 00:42:51.837
which means he thought
that I actually might say yes.

592
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:54.978
which means he's not
just a little off-kilter like I thought.

593
00:42:55.073 --> 00:42:59.157
He's actually... he's insane.
And my dad wants me to say yes.

594
00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:01.822
But I always knew
that he was fucking nuts.

595
00:43:04.082 --> 00:43:06.164
So. here I am.

596
00:43:09.087 --> 00:43:10.087
Hey. you're bleeding.

597
00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:12.537
- Oh.
- Here.

598
00:43:13.925 --> 00:43:16.416
- Oh. No. no. no. it's fine.
- Let me see.

599
00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:18.502
Jj

600
00:43:38.032 --> 00:43:40.523
Turn it off. Turn it off!

601
00:43:41.536 --> 00:43:43.777
Just... man. turn it off!

602
00:43:43.871 --> 00:43:45.987
Just go. Go. go.

603
00:43:46.082 --> 00:43:48.118
We're gonna piss a lot of people off.

604
00:43:49.127 --> 00:43:50.583
To hell with them.

605
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:53.662
Jj

606
00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:18.858
Meanwhile. Terrence uberahl's
hitman. Wayne mccarty.

607
00:44:18.948 --> 00:44:20.984
who had instructed Terrence
fo leave his payment

608
00:44:21.075 --> 00:44:24.408
in a bathroom stall at club wildlife
the night before.

609
00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:26.736
was making a detour with his wife Barbie

610
00:44:26.831 --> 00:44:29.413
en route to killing
Pamela corbett-ragsdale.

611
00:44:32.044 --> 00:44:34.831
Hey. You got this. baby.

612
00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:36.878
I'll be right here. cheering you on.

613
00:44:37.925 --> 00:44:39.256
I'm so ashamed.

614
00:44:41.262 --> 00:44:43.253
I feel like a bloody criminal.

615
00:44:43.347 --> 00:44:44.962
You're no criminal.

616
00:44:46.434 --> 00:44:49.597
You're just a guy with a big heart

617
00:44:53.482 --> 00:44:58.226
remember. Serenity is not
the absence of conflict...

618
00:44:59.405 --> 00:45:01.987
But the ability to cope with it.

619
00:45:02.074 --> 00:45:03.530
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

620
00:45:04.911 --> 00:45:06.151
We slipped.

621
00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:09.866
This is part of making it right.
You know it.

622
00:45:11.292 --> 00:45:12.623
Yeah. I know it.

623
00:45:12.752 --> 00:45:16.165
Mm-hmm.
so you just go on in there

624
00:45:16.297 --> 00:45:19.960
and give that boy back his wallet
and tell him you're sorry.

625
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:25.757
You're a strong man. Wayne mccarty.

626
00:45:26.766 --> 00:45:29.508
Yeah. That's why I love you.

627
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.760
Now. go be strong.

628
00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:36.806
I don't deserve you. baby.

629
00:45:38.319 --> 00:45:39.980
I don't deserve you.

630
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.150
Okay.

631
00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:52.739
Jj

632
00:45:53.751 --> 00:45:55.491
Oh!

633
00:46:06.722 --> 00:46:09.805
Mate. hey. you know. you shouldn't
leave your door open like that.

634
00:46:09.892 --> 00:46:12.008
Geez. any weirdo
could just walk in on you.

635
00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:16.349
Oh. hey. guys.

636
00:46:16.482 --> 00:46:19.440
I'm looking for. uh. rabbit.

637
00:46:19.527 --> 00:46:21.643
Who the fuck are you. man?

638
00:46:21.737 --> 00:46:24.023
I'm the guy looking for rabbit.
Who the fuck are you?

639
00:46:24.115 --> 00:46:26.151
We're looking for Ben gibbon.

640
00:46:26.242 --> 00:46:28.512
Ben is rabbit. See? We're looking
for the same person. okay?

641
00:46:28.536 --> 00:46:31.903
So relax. I'm friends with him.
You guys friends with him?

642
00:46:31.998 --> 00:46:33.954
Didn't think so.
Look. let's start again.

643
00:46:34.041 --> 00:46:35.041
My name's...

644
00:46:37.253 --> 00:46:38.253
Oh...

645
00:46:40.506 --> 00:46:42.212
Good hit. buddy.

646
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.040
Good hit. Stop. stop. stop. stop.

647
00:46:48.347 --> 00:46:49.712
On.

648
00:46:49.807 --> 00:46:51.217
S

649
00:46:53.519 --> 00:46:55.555
Stop. Time out. Time out. Stop.

650
00:46:58.232 --> 00:47:00.393
We're all looking for Ben.
You hear that?

651
00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:03.066
Oh. look. he's pulling up
right now. guys. Look at...

652
00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:09.232
Jj

653
00:47:21.088 --> 00:47:23.579
Fucking start the car!

654
00:47:23.716 --> 00:47:24.716
Oh. shit.

655
00:47:27.762 --> 00:47:28.762
Hey!

656
00:47:28.804 --> 00:47:29.804
Bye. guys!

657
00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:33.426
- Hey!
- Come on!

658
00:47:36.103 --> 00:47:38.310
Benji. you here?

659
00:47:38.397 --> 00:47:41.389
Jj

660
00:47:46.906 --> 00:47:47.986
On.

661
00:47:56.582 --> 00:47:57.947
- Hey. Mukul.
- Hey.

662
00:47:58.042 --> 00:47:59.623
Uh. you... you've met Mary.

663
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.746
- Hi. Hi. again.
- Hello. there.

664
00:48:01.837 --> 00:48:03.793
Um. I'm gonna go dry off.

665
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:04.881
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

666
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.960
She's sweet.

667
00:48:08.511 --> 00:48:10.047
- You good?
- Yeah.

668
00:48:10.137 --> 00:48:11.752
- So all bong gone?
- Yeah.

669
00:48:11.847 --> 00:48:13.633
What?

670
00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:17.342
So nothing weird or unusual to report?

671
00:48:18.354 --> 00:48:20.185
- No.
- No one weird?

672
00:48:21.273 --> 00:48:22.763
- No.
- Okay.

673
00:48:24.151 --> 00:48:25.482
- Why?
- Just...

674
00:48:26.654 --> 00:48:28.986
- You good?
- Yeah.

675
00:48:29.115 --> 00:48:31.322
Just keep your guard up. Hmm?

676
00:48:32.785 --> 00:48:35.242
You worry too much. brother. I love you.

677
00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:36.819
- Love you.
- Today is a great day!

678
00:48:36.914 --> 00:48:38.154
Just...

679
00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:39.329
Oh...

680
00:48:49.427 --> 00:48:51.793
Nice coat. Where'd you get it?

681
00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:54.003
A gift from me to you. Take it.

682
00:48:55.015 --> 00:48:56.926
You're too kind. really.

683
00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:02.348
All these people are dead.

684
00:49:09.864 --> 00:49:11.104
Turn around.

685
00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:15.069
Turn around.

686
00:49:30.259 --> 00:49:31.339
Okay.

687
00:49:35.848 --> 00:49:38.134
Stop looking at me like that.
You're making me shy.

688
00:49:59.538 --> 00:50:02.245
Oh. cool.

689
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.420
Hmm.

690
00:50:16.555 --> 00:50:19.843
I still think about going away
to one of these places.

691
00:50:21.185 --> 00:50:25.679
Just starting a totally new life
where no one knows me.

692
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.180
Totally anonymous.

693
00:50:29.193 --> 00:50:30.933
Well. that sounds nice. doesn't it?

694
00:50:33.489 --> 00:50:36.401
No. it's stupid. childish.

695
00:50:36.492 --> 00:50:39.359
- Childish. maybe. Not stupid.
- Yeah.

696
00:50:39.453 --> 00:50:42.695
Well. I tried it. It didn't exactly
pan out. so...

697
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:45.953
Mm. No. you didn't.

698
00:50:46.085 --> 00:50:47.291
You bailed on it.

699
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:04.675
You... you kept yours?

700
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:07.182
- You didn't?
- I used mine.

701
00:51:07.273 --> 00:51:09.559
You left. so I went on my own.

702
00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:13.354
I didn't leave. I was sent.

703
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:17.150
On.

704
00:51:19.326 --> 00:51:21.658
It's a pretty crazy idea
for a couple of kids.

705
00:51:22.705 --> 00:51:23.911
Yeah.

706
00:51:30.588 --> 00:51:32.920
- Do you have a death wish?
- What?

707
00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:36.047
Why would you ask that?

708
00:51:36.135 --> 00:51:38.296
I don't know. I'm just curious.

709
00:51:39.305 --> 00:51:40.305
Curious about what?

710
00:51:41.307 --> 00:51:43.673
Do you wanna die?

711
00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:46.679
- Didn't realize I had a choice.
- I'm being serious.

712
00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:49.261
When you think about dying.

713
00:51:49.356 --> 00:51:51.347
is it something that excites you?

714
00:51:54.153 --> 00:51:55.359
I don't know.

715
00:52:06.206 --> 00:52:07.321
Who's this?

716
00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:11.283
- That's my mom.
- My god.

717
00:52:13.464 --> 00:52:15.580
- She was a badass.
- Yeah.

718
00:52:15.674 --> 00:52:17.380
Married my dad young.

719
00:52:37.905 --> 00:52:39.020
May I?

720
00:52:41.617 --> 00:52:42.857
Be my guest.

721
00:52:47.206 --> 00:52:48.366
Thanks.

722
00:53:18.529 --> 00:53:20.360
Why would a guy like you wanna die?

723
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.277
- I never said I did.
- You didn't say you didn't.

724
00:53:29.915 --> 00:53:32.122
What does it feel like
to get punched in the face?

725
00:53:33.127 --> 00:53:36.290
Um. I don't know. It hurts.

726
00:53:37.297 --> 00:53:38.662
Yeah?

727
00:53:38.799 --> 00:53:40.289
You like that or something?

728
00:53:44.596 --> 00:53:46.052
Punch me in the face.

729
00:53:47.725 --> 00:53:50.011
- What? No.
- I wanna know what it feels like.

730
00:53:50.102 --> 00:53:52.414
- I'm not gonna punch you in the face.
- I give you full permission.

731
00:53:52.438 --> 00:53:54.895
Just punch me.
like. right in the kisser. Do it.

732
00:53:54.982 --> 00:53:56.668
- What?
- Come on! A girl never gets a chance.

733
00:53:56.692 --> 00:53:58.057
- No. no.
- Do it!

734
00:53:58.152 --> 00:53:59.813
- Uh. I'm... I'm not...
- Just do it!

735
00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:01.343
Do it or I'll punch you in the face.

736
00:54:01.405 --> 00:54:03.066
- Oh. really?
- Yeah. do it.

737
00:54:03.157 --> 00:54:04.897
On the count of three. all right?

738
00:54:04.992 --> 00:54:07.108
One. two...

739
00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120
I will do it.

740
00:54:10.122 --> 00:54:11.658
- Three.
- All right.

741
00:54:21.508 --> 00:54:22.748
That was a good one.

742
00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:28.450
- What are you doing?
- I told you to punch me in the face.

743
00:54:28.474 --> 00:54:30.154
- I'm not gonna punch you.
- I told you to!

744
00:54:30.184 --> 00:54:32.162
- I'm not... I'm not gonna...
- I told you to punch me.

745
00:54:32.186 --> 00:54:35.599
Uh. Mary. please.
Hey. Mary. stop.

746
00:54:35.689 --> 00:54:37.350
Why was it so easy for you to move on?

747
00:54:37.441 --> 00:54:39.181
Mary. it wasn't easy. It fucking sucked.

748
00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:41.517
- So why didn't you miss me?
- I did miss you!

749
00:54:41.653 --> 00:54:43.939
Why didn't you write me back?

750
00:54:44.031 --> 00:54:45.692
- Back?
- I wrote you!

751
00:54:45.783 --> 00:54:47.865
Mary. I never got any letters!

752
00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:50.442
- What?
- I never got any letters.

753
00:54:52.873 --> 00:54:54.409
I promise. I swear.

754
00:54:55.584 --> 00:54:56.994
Oh. my god.

755
00:54:57.085 --> 00:54:59.997
I'm so... oh. my god.

756
00:55:02.382 --> 00:55:04.839
It's okay. Hey. hey. hey.

757
00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:18.479
My dad. Terrence. they stole
all that time from us.

758
00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:24.518
Hey.

759
00:55:25.906 --> 00:55:28.648
We're here right now
and that's all that matters.

760
00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.036
- Hmm?
- I'm sorry.

761
00:55:36.333 --> 00:55:38.198
- I'm sorry.
- No. no.

762
00:55:38.293 --> 00:55:39.408
Hey.

763
00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:48.004
- Hello.
- Hello.

764
00:55:49.263 --> 00:55:50.548
Yeah. hello.

765
00:55:51.849 --> 00:55:54.010
Who is this?

766
00:55:54.101 --> 00:55:57.309
I think you have this phone call thing
backwards. You called me.

767
00:55:57.437 --> 00:55:59.052
I'm looking for Mary.

768
00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:02.852
Is everything copacetic over there?

769
00:56:05.279 --> 00:56:07.440
Right as rain. friend.

770
00:56:07.531 --> 00:56:09.271
I'm not your friend.

771
00:56:09.366 --> 00:56:11.982
No? Then why'd you call me?

772
00:56:12.995 --> 00:56:16.112
I'm gonna call you Pinocchio.

773
00:56:16.248 --> 00:56:17.579
And why's that?

774
00:56:18.584 --> 00:56:20.040
He was nosy.

775
00:58:09.486 --> 00:58:12.523
If it's true
that rathcart computers were wired

776
00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:18.109
to monitor the activity of high-profile
customers through their built-in cameras.

777
00:58:18.203 --> 00:58:19.659
that could very well be the straw

778
00:58:19.746 --> 00:58:23.364
that finally breaks the back
of the rathcart corporation.

779
00:58:23.458 --> 00:58:26.825
We go live now
to a gbn breaking news exclusive.

780
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:29.832
Multiple shots fired
near the financial district.

781
00:58:29.923 --> 00:58:31.914
Reports of a deadly car crash.

782
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:33.836
We've got more on this story

783
00:58:33.927 --> 00:58:37.920
and continuing coverage
of the rathcart scandal as it develops.

784
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.032
Jj

785
00:59:13.133 --> 00:59:16.375
Oh. sh...

786
00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:29.221
Wake up. angel. Wake up.

787
00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.071
Jj

788
00:59:46.083 --> 00:59:48.199
Shh. shh.

789
01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:05.716
Jj

790
01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:31.418
Mm.

791
01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:40.799
Hi.

792
01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:45.013
So what do we do now?

793
01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:49.808
Let's get out of here.

794
01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:52.182
Sure. Where?

795
01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:54.230
No. I mean out of this city.

796
01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:57.559
Let's just get out of here.
away from everything and everyone.

797
01:00:57.654 --> 01:01:00.737
- Let's go.
- Where would we go?

798
01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:05.992
You know. I still like Mexico.

799
01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:07.569
All the fugitives go to Mexico.

800
01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:08.824
Mm-hmm.

801
01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:16.002
- We really could. We could. couldn't we?
- Yeah.

802
01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:18.671
We can buy a little spot
on the beach.

803
01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:22.751
Just lay around in the sun
till we're old and gray.

804
01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:25.880
- And I'll become a fisherman.
- And I'll open a shack stand.

805
01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:29.137
And I'll sell fish tacos to tourists.

806
01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:34.729
He'll try to stop us. you know.

807
01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:37.148
- Let him try.
- Yeah.

808
01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.565
Well. you don't know my father.

809
01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:43.442
And you don't know Terrence uberahl.
He will come looking for me.

810
01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:44.989
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

811
01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:47.909
- Then I'll protect you.
- And I'll protect you.

812
01:01:50.081 --> 01:01:51.617
For how long?

813
01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.539
For as long as you want me to.

814
01:01:57.631 --> 01:01:59.167
How about forever?

815
01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:07.507
Mary rathcart.

816
01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:10.094
Yes?

817
01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:13.928
I'm sick of waiting for my life to start.

818
01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:18.356
I'm sick of trying so hard
to feel something.

819
01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:22.565
And you coming back
made me realize I...

820
01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.484
I just wanna be...

821
01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.775
Happy.

822
01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:29.912
Yeah.

823
01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:37.666
When?

824
01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:42.088
There's no time like the present.

825
01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:50.256
Jj

826
01:03:14.666 --> 01:03:15.872
Have a seat.

827
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:27.714
Look. I. um. I came here today
as a professional courtesy.

828
01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:30.796
This is me being professional.
and there's your courtesy.

829
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:33.552
And I just wanna get
straight to the point here. mate.

830
01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:35.471
Look. you contracted me to do a job.

831
01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:38.520
you paid in full upfront.
just like I instructed you to do.

832
01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:41.602
Circumstances have changed

833
01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:45.944
such that they no longer permit me
to carry out the said job.

834
01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:52.534
So therefore. here I am
to willingly return my compensation.

835
01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.702
Whoa. what?

836
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:57.906
I'm not gonna kill
Pamela corbett-ragsdale.

837
01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.741
Your cash is in the bag.

838
01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:03.749
You can chalk it up
to a recent personal tragedy.

839
01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:05.747
Now. I've got a new. more pressing job.

840
01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:09.585
- Hey. if it's about the money...
- It's not about the money. mate.

841
01:04:11.723 --> 01:04:13.759
There is an angel up there...

842
01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:17.675
Waiting at the gates of heaven.

843
01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:21.059
and the password for her entrance
is "revenge."

844
01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:24.516
Hey. listen. if corbett-ragsdale makes it
to that interview today.

845
01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:29.822
there are some very powerful people
that will be awfully upset.

846
01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:32.490
I get that. mate.

847
01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:36.035
But I'm pretty fucking upset myself
at the moment.

848
01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:39.956
And that is why I came here in person.
which I never do.

849
01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:42.043
to give you enough time
to make other arrangements.

850
01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:45.962
Oh. enough time! Enough time!

851
01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:49.507
You've wasted all the time we had!

852
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:54.390
Fuck!

853
01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:57.762
In the brief duration of your employment.

854
01:04:57.852 --> 01:05:01.811
you have been privy
to some very incriminating information

855
01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.980
and that presents me with an issue.

856
01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:08.318
Don't go wasting your time
making idle threats there. lollipop.

857
01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:11.813
I've been in the bloody blood business

858
01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:14.650
since you were handing out
handjobs at hanson concerts.

859
01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:18.153
So I know better than you.

860
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:20.245
Loose lips sink ships.

861
01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.996
You won't have no problem from me.

862
01:05:25.004 --> 01:05:26.869
You've got my word.

863
01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:30.128
Now. if you'll please excuse me.

864
01:05:30.218 --> 01:05:32.880
I'm gonna catch a love story
at the local cinema.

865
01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:37.597
And then I'm gonna track down
a pair of lady killers.

866
01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:46.314
What's the name of that painting
you got there on the wall?

867
01:05:47.527 --> 01:05:49.358
- Fuck you.
- Mm. Good name.

868
01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:54.022
Jj

869
01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:08.752
Gibbon. that son of a bitch.
must have goften to him.

870
01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.707
Follow the didgeridoo.
Take care of him.

871
01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.918
You find Mary and that gibbon kid.

872
01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:16.844
I wanna talk to them personally.

873
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:21.807
I think we may have
just lost the medicine for our little bug.

874
01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:23.635
What's plan b? Plan b?

875
01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:24.936
Yeah.

876
01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:26.679
There is no plan b.

877
01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:30.892
I thought I told you to hire the best.
Who the fuck is this guy?

878
01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:33.896
No. he came highly recommended.

879
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.759
- I wasn't anticipating. sir...
- Terrence. listen to me.

880
01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:36.818
- Yes.
- Ll jsten to me.

881
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:38.320
I am sick of excuses. all right?

882
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:39.947
- I am sick of them.
- Yes. sir.

883
01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:43.155
- Figure this out now.
- I'll handle it myself.

884
01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:45.240
While... while I have you.

885
01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:49.169
I seem to have lost track
of Mary during all this.

886
01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:52.839
I'm beginning to worry and I was hoping
that maybe you had a chance to...

887
01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:55.668
- Terrence. stop.
- Maybe you had a chance to...

888
01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:58.299
Terrence. how about you stop
worrying about my daughter

889
01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:01.423
and focus on silencing corbett-ragsdale?

890
01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:03.725
You know where she is. Now. get it done.

891
01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:06.177
- I'm coming in.
- Of course.

892
01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:09.264
Jj

893
01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:28.374
I bet your speech was swell.

894
01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:33.334
Did you tell them that funny story
you told me yesterday?

895
01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:34.831
No.

896
01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:38.677
I didn't think of it.
All I could think of was my...

897
01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:41.547
Fatal errors have
a way of compounding.

898
01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:44.098
and Terrence uberahl's
previous mistakes

899
01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:46.676
were about to inspire yet another.

900
01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:48.582
Told them that I used
your money. all of it.

901
01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:51.018
to buy furniture for this apartment.

902
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:52.849
That's silly. Your money. my money.

903
01:07:52.944 --> 01:07:55.130
What difference does it make?
It wasn't very much anyway.

904
01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:57.915
Maybe I could have told them
the baby has to sleep in the dining room.

905
01:07:57.991 --> 01:08:00.482
It's only temporary
till we get another apartment.

906
01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:13.536
You ever seen this movie? Huh?

907
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:19.669
It was my Barbie's favorite movie!

908
01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:23.380
Jj

909
01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:30.349
Speak up.
Stand right up to Doolittle.

910
01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:33.022
Don't ask for your rights.
Demand them.

911
01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:38.061
Remember the day in
Boston when I got you this ring...

912
01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:43.336
Well. I don't
want a better one later.

913
01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:49.602
___ohe with the diamonds.

914
01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.116
That can watt.

915
01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:55.579
Yeah. well. I suppose
the mink coat can wait too.

916
01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:57.663
Jj

917
01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:27.337
Why can't you be
a good soldier. huh?

918
01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:28.922
Huh?!

919
01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:36.847
Jj

920
01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:52.487
Miss corbett-ragsdale? I'm
your security detail. here to escort you.

921
01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:59.002
Hello? Miss corbett-ragsdale?

922
01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:02.921
Miss co...

923
01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:05.000
Jj

924
01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:29.194
Hello? Ben?

925
01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:45.502
Is it love?

926
01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:46.673
- Yes.
- Yes.

927
01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:51.178
- True love?
- Is there any other kind?

928
01:11:52.558 --> 01:11:54.048
How do you know?

929
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:57.639
I've always known.

930
01:11:58.773 --> 01:12:00.058
Yeah. me. too.

931
01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:03.892
When you're young.
you know everything.

932
01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.112
Try not to forget.

933
01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:18.035
Have you thought about the fallout?
It's not gonna be pretty.

934
01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:21.492
Don't you think that family rivalries
are a little passé?

935
01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:27.086
It is going
to take some heavy lifting

936
01:12:27.218 --> 01:12:28.924
to get our families
together on a wedding.

937
01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:31.593
- No big wedding.
- No families. no.

938
01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:35.840
Just thinking about doing a good
old-fashioned shotgun variety. right?

939
01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:37.516
Yeah. Yeah.

940
01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.685
What. today?

941
01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:40.772
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

942
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.268
Benjamin. would you deny your mother
a proper wedding for her only child?

943
01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:51.030
At the very least. a girl needs a dress
on her wedding day.

944
01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:52.607
- My son needs a tuxedo.
- Mom...

945
01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:55.739
- She's wearing a fucking dress.
- Okay. Mrs. gibbon.

946
01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.788
I'll wear a dress.

947
01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:05.294
I guess you should get
used to calling me "mom."

948
01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:10.834
What about your mother?

949
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:13.461
No. No. she wouldn't come anyway.

950
01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:17.765
Mom. you're the only one
that can know about this.

951
01:13:18.853 --> 01:13:22.186
But you need a wedding party.

952
01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:24.309
Don't you have
anyone else you can call?

953
01:13:26.694 --> 01:13:28.150
Um...

954
01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:36.651
Jj

955
01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:09.605
- Okay.
- I know. It's so exciting.

956
01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:11.455
Well. I'm hoping
that we have time to do that

957
01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:13.717
- before everything gets comp...
- Well. wait. wait. wait.

958
01:14:13.741 --> 01:14:15.277
Well. what...

959
01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:18.863
Well?

960
01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:24.324
Thank you for the dress. Mrs. gibbon.

961
01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:26.829
It's my pleasure.

962
01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.292
Excuse me for a moment.

963
01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:32.669
Jj

964
01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:00.910
Please leave
a message after the tone.

965
01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:03.613
Hi. Beatrice. It's Nancy gibbon calling.

966
01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:07.291
Your daughter and my son
are getting married today.

967
01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:10.085
at the church on St. Peter's street. 5:00.

968
01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:12.921
and I know that it would mean a lot to her
if her mother was there.

969
01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:15.216
It's time to leave
this bad blood behind us.

970
01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:21.910
What do you want?

971
01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:24.266
What do you know about the wedding?

972
01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:25.353
What wedding?

973
01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:27.770
Mary and the gibbon kid.
they're getting married today.

974
01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:34.522
What did you say?

975
01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.775
They're getting married. Today.

976
01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:48.036
Oh. fuck me!

977
01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:51.119
Jj

978
01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:05.132
- It's me.
- What do you want?

979
01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:07.885
You're all I ever wanted.

980
01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:12.019
From the moment I laid eyes on you.
it's always been about you.

981
01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:15.476
I mean. I waited. I bided time.

982
01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:18.904
I knew that you needed convincing.
I knew that.

983
01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:20.322
But listen.

984
01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:27.238
I think my big city days are done.

985
01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:30.992
I'm skipping town. babe.
and you're coming with me.

986
01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:33.203
- Terrence...
- I need you to understand something.

987
01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:36.672
If you would just give me a chance.

988
01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:40.627
I can make you so happy.

989
01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:54.025
Okay.

990
01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:56.027
Okay.

991
01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:02.694
I've been wanting to tell you something.

992
01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:04.776
but I don't wanna ruin the mood.

993
01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:09.075
Someone called last night.

994
01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:12.203
A guy. Looking for Mary.

995
01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:15.661
He was...

996
01:17:20.719 --> 01:17:22.050
Troubling.

997
01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:27.556
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

998
01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:39.736
Do you remember the first time we met?
Remember what you called it?

999
01:17:42.032 --> 01:17:43.032
Fate.

1000
01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:45.779
By way of random chaos.

1001
01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:54.667
I'm just letting what's meant to be. be.

1002
01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:03.418
Jj

1003
01:18:05.472 --> 01:18:07.508
Hey.

1004
01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:11.725
You're not supposed to see me
in my dress. It's bad luck.

1005
01:18:11.812 --> 01:18:14.394
I'll take my chances.
You look so beautiful.

1006
01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:24.989
It's the moment of truth.
Are you sure you wanna do this?

1007
01:18:25.075 --> 01:18:28.818
- I'm sure. Are you?
- I'm positive.

1008
01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:34.118
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

1009
01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.682
- William.
- Terrence.

1010
01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:55.136
Thank god. Where are you?

1011
01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:57.347
- You knew about this. didn't you?
- Slow down.

1012
01:18:57.441 --> 01:19:00.649
- Huh? The wedding!
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1013
01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:03.523
- Mary and the gibbon kid?
- I swear.

1014
01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:07.152
St. Peter's street.
Why did you let this happen?

1015
01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:09.491
- I had no idea.
- I'm going down there.

1016
01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.156
I'm gonna find that son of a bitch!

1017
01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:12.766
I don't think you wanna do that. Terrence.

1018
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:15.623
- Too late!
- Listen to me. We can figure this out.

1019
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:17.324
Terre... hello.

1020
01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:19.910
Terrence? Terrence?

1021
01:19:28.514 --> 01:19:31.301
- Where is that rat-fuck headed?
- A chapel downtown.

1022
01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:34.428
My daughter's getting married.

1023
01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:36.437
Aw.

1024
01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:39.851
Well. let's go.

1025
01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:42.516
You're taking me with you?

1026
01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:47.153
It's your baby girl's wedding.

1027
01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:50.233
Jj

1028
01:19:54.248 --> 01:19:55.613
Here we are. guys.

1029
01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:58.953
I prepared a little something.

1030
01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:06.841
Welcome to this beautiful union
between these two people...

1031
01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:13.298
In this beautiful space. together.

1032
01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:17.551
Thank you.

1033
01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:19.511
Stunning. both of you.

1034
01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:24.650
In the judeo-Christian creation myth.

1035
01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:28.070
Adam and Eve are banished from the garden

1036
01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:30.489
for disobeying god's sacred laws.

1037
01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:33.779
But I invite you to consider.

1038
01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:36.738
while they knew nothing
but beauty in the garden.

1039
01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:41.075
they did not know love

1040
01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:43.035
until they were forced to face

1041
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:46.918
the ugliness
of the outside world together.

1042
01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:52.086
They clung to each other
in the face of a vicious world.

1043
01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:58.009
and. in so doing.
gave birth to love itself.

1044
01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:11.530
Terrence.

1045
01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:15.192
Hello. Mary.

1046
01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:19.446
You don't wanna do this.

1047
01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.122
Nobody move.

1048
01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.627
You broke my heart.

1049
01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:28.122
- Terrence...
- I protected you.

1050
01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:30.879
Just put the gun down.
It's not too late.

1051
01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:33.176
It was always too late!

1052
01:21:35.516 --> 01:21:36.516
Huh?

1053
01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:38.844
- Terrence!
- No!

1054
01:21:38.936 --> 01:21:40.801
- You.
- No! No!

1055
01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:41.896
Hey! Hey!

1056
01:21:45.442 --> 01:21:47.273
It was always about you.

1057
01:21:47.361 --> 01:21:53.482
I had to listen to her sob stories
about you over and over and over again.

1058
01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:56.738
I was fucking sick of you
before I even met you.

1059
01:21:56.829 --> 01:21:58.239
- Yeah.
- No.

1060
01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.571
Back up! Back up!

1061
01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:02.327
- Terrence. please!
- Stay back!

1062
01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:04.033
Please! Please.

1063
01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:06.330
- Shh...
- Stop! Stop.

1064
01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:07.958
No.

1065
01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:11.874
Don't hurt him! Don't hurt him!

1066
01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:12.969
Ben!

1067
01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:15.510
Ben!

1068
01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:20.348
Don't you know the penalty for hunting
in the king's forest is death?

1069
01:22:25.983 --> 01:22:29.020
Jj

1070
01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:42.329
You call this a man. huh?

1071
01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:44.748
I ook at me. I'm a man.

1072
01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:47.917
Give me that.

1073
01:22:57.055 --> 01:22:58.636
Give me the gun.

1074
01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:06.057
Wayne?

1075
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.351
Rabbit?

1076
01:23:08.442 --> 01:23:10.558
You got your wallet. Right? Eh?

1077
01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:13.905
What?

1078
01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:23.571
All right. could everybody
please sit down? Come on.

1079
01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:25.280
Come on. now. Chop chop.

1080
01:23:26.793 --> 01:23:29.910
Not on the floor. ladies.
You'll ruin your bloody dresses.

1081
01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:31.586
Sit in the pews.

1082
01:23:31.715 --> 01:23:33.171
Come on.

1083
01:23:33.258 --> 01:23:35.169
Including you. sunshine.

1084
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.921
I'll take it from here.

1085
01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:39.591
Yeah. yeah. sit. sit. Good boy.

1086
01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:43.470
- Is this your wedding?
- Yeah.

1087
01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:47.431
Congratulations. mate.

1088
01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:50.889
Hey. What are you doing here?

1089
01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:54.985
Well. as fate would have it.

1090
01:23:55.072 --> 01:23:57.484
I reckon we got ourselves
a common enemy.

1091
01:23:57.574 --> 01:23:58.780
Let him up.

1092
01:24:00.244 --> 01:24:01.324
Get up.

1093
01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:08.957
I'm not gonna let you ruin
this love story.

1094
01:24:11.922 --> 01:24:13.287
All right.

1095
01:24:16.802 --> 01:24:20.340
Ladies. you might wanna look away.

1096
01:24:26.478 --> 01:24:27.718
This is for my angel.

1097
01:24:37.823 --> 01:24:40.906
Oh. shit.

1098
01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:43.985
Jj

1099
01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:54.502
Hey. hey. hey. hey! Freeze!

1100
01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:08.975
Keep your eyes on the prize. rabbit.

1101
01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:21.070
Put the gun down!

1102
01:25:29.082 --> 01:25:30.947
Put the gun down. Terrence.

1103
01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:33.200
Mary.

1104
01:25:35.255 --> 01:25:36.255
C'est la vie.

1105
01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:39.294
- No!
- No!

1106
01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:44.135
No!

1107
01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.644
For Ben. the moment
lasted a lifetime.

1108
01:25:56.652 --> 01:25:59.268
But his life didn't
flash before his eyes.

1109
01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:02.942
Instead. his mind traveled to the memory
of a childhood toy.

1110
01:26:03.033 --> 01:26:06.571
a red view-master he received
for his fifth birthday.

1111
01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:11.122
As a boy. Ben spent hours flipping
through pictures of miraculous things

1112
01:26:11.208 --> 01:26:14.041
and momentous periods
of human history.

1113
01:26:14.127 --> 01:26:16.083
Though too young
to understand it at the time.

1114
01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:19.413
Ben was struck
by the seemingly impossible fact

1115
01:26:19.549 --> 01:26:22.757
that these were images of real things

1116
01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:27.713
and that they were all mere specks
of a cataclysmically immense reality

1117
01:26:27.808 --> 01:26:31.721
he could never fully grasp or even accept.

1118
01:26:31.812 --> 01:26:34.474
He remembered feeling weightless.

1119
01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:37.814
He had contemplated
this moment many times.

1120
01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:39.937
He had dreamt up countless scenarios.

1121
01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:42.644
He had imagined many good deaths.

1122
01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:46.027
But he couldn't remember any of them now.

1123
01:26:46.118 --> 01:26:49.736
Instead. he thought of Mary.

1124
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:51.786
Jj

1125
01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:09.425
Hey.

1126
01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:13.099
Ben. Ben!

1127
01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:31.736
Jj

1128
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:54.810
Hey. hey.

1129
01:27:54.895 --> 01:27:55.930
Hey.

1130
01:27:56.938 --> 01:27:57.938
Hey.

1131
01:27:57.981 --> 01:28:00.347
Stay with me. Ben.

1132
01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:05.477
I didn't get to say. "I do."

1133
01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:10.865
I do. too.

1134
01:28:20.212 --> 01:28:23.796
Ben had always imagined
that. in some shape or form.

1135
01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:25.418
it would end right here.

1136
01:28:25.509 --> 01:28:28.751
He would have gone down in history
as an incorrigible rascal

1137
01:28:28.845 --> 01:28:31.257
just not meant for this world.

1138
01:28:31.348 --> 01:28:33.213
Death makes for good punctuation.

1139
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:36.137
and his was supposed
to be a perfect example...

1140
01:28:36.228 --> 01:28:40.562
A romantic hero who lived fast.
died young. and left a beautiful corpse.

1141
01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:43.181
But it doesn't end that way.

1142
01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:48.020
Like it or not. and for reasons none of us
will ever understand.

1143
01:28:48.114 --> 01:28:51.698
sometimes fate decides to step in

1144
01:28:51.785 --> 01:28:55.243
and stick us with a happy ending.
