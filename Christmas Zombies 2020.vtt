(somber vocalized music)

46
00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:27.779
was kind of an outcast at the North Pole.

known for always overstuffing the dolls.

48
00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.435
He was pretty upset for having
to work that doll station

49
00:02:35.435 --> 00:02:36.518

recognition for his hard work.

The only thing he ever received

54
00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:54.333
was the nickname Stuffy.

55
00:02:56.442 --> 00:03:00.629
Before the season began.
he requested a transfer

56
00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.212
to elf security and was denied.

57
00:03:04.808 --> 00:03:06.292

00:09:21.457 --> 00:09:24.700
- This year we have taken notice

187
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.358
of all of your hard work.

188
00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:29.780
but there's one elf in particular

189
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.951
that worked extra hard.

190
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:34.849
(drum rolling)

191
00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:35.682
Jolly!

192
00:09:35.682 --> 00:09:36.515
- Yeah!
(audience applauding)

193
00:09:36.515 --> 00:09:39.503
- Come and get your award.
(audience cheering)

194
00:09:39.503 --> 00:09:40.920
- Awarded to who?

195
00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:48.375
(audience applauding and cheering)

196
00:09:51.795 --> 00:09:55.545
(audience members whistling)

197
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:10.743
- I vow to never
(tense music)

198
00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:12.326
stuff a doll again.

199
00:10:14.292 --> 00:10:15.703
Give here.
(Jolly screams)

200
00:10:15.703 --> 00:10:17.920
(Stuffy growling)

201
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.753
(suspenseful music)

202
00:10:18.753 --> 00:10:21.686
And I'll show you what
I'm gonna do with this.

203
00:10:21.686 --> 00:10:24.637
(grunts) I know karate.

204
00:10:24.637 --> 00:10:26.637
What are you looking at?

205
00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:30.087
- Ho. ho. ho. ho. ho.

206
00:10:30.087 --> 00:10:31.448
How are you. Jolly?

207
00:10:31.448 --> 00:10:33.886
- Stuffy stole my award present.

208
00:10:33.886 --> 00:10:35.282
- We need to talk to Stuffy.

209
00:10:35.282 --> 00:10:37.447
Thank you. Santa.

210
00:10:37.447 --> 00:10:40.786
- Missile-Toe. did you
get my transfer paperwork?

211
00:10:40.786 --> 00:10:43.284
- Yeah. I received your transfer papers.

212
00:10:43.284 --> 00:10:44.201
- Uh. okay.

213
00:10:45.434 --> 00:10:49.154
- But Santa told me. it's not approved.

214
00:10:49.154 --> 00:10:50.706
- Big Red!

215
00:10:50.706 --> 00:10:52.245
He did what?

216
00:10:52.245 --> 00:10:53.746
I'm sorry. Stuffy.

217
00:10:53.746 --> 00:10:57.675
- (groans) We'll see about that.

218
00:10:57.675 --> 00:11:00.069
- [Holly] Hi. Stuffy.
Why aren't you stuffing?

219
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:01.527
- I'm on strike.

220
00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:02.717
- [Holly] Why?

221
00:11:02.717 --> 00:11:06.378
- Because I didn't win the competition.

222
00:11:06.378 --> 00:11:07.472
- [Holly] Well. just
because you didn't win.

223
00:11:07.472 --> 00:11:08.305
doesn't mean you
(slow jazzy music)

224
00:11:08.305 --> 00:11:10.578
have to work with bad heart.

225
00:11:10.578 --> 00:11:13.578
- I've worked hard here for 10 years

226
00:11:14.893 --> 00:11:16.870
and I've gotten no credit.

227
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:17.806
(tense music)

228
00:11:17.806 --> 00:11:19.395
- [Holly] Maybe that's
because you weren't working

229
00:11:19.395 --> 00:11:20.895
with a good heart.

230
00:11:23.098 --> 00:11:25.848
- You take this and you stuff it.

231
00:11:27.563 --> 00:11:29.559
I'm outta here.

232
00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:30.809
I need a break.

233
00:11:31.654 --> 00:11:34.618
Look. Santa. you decided to raise my pay.

234
00:11:34.618 --> 00:11:36.024
Thank you very much.

235
00:11:36.024 --> 00:11:37.395
- No. Stuffy.

236
00:11:37.395 --> 00:11:39.694
We need to address your behavior issues.

237
00:11:39.694 --> 00:11:41.565
- What now. Santa?

238
00:11:41.565 --> 00:11:46.565
- Jolly told me that you
tried to eat her award gift

239
00:11:46.585 --> 00:11:49.265
and then you kicked it across the stage!

240
00:11:49.265 --> 00:11:51.225
- I didn't do that. Santa.

241
00:11:51.225 --> 00:11:54.675
- Stuffy. there is no need to lie.

242
00:11:54.675 --> 00:11:58.689
- Okay. I was a little upset
I didn't win the award.

243
00:11:58.689 --> 00:12:02.014
- This is your last chance
to get off my naughty list.

244
00:12:02.014 --> 00:12:03.175
- What? Why you didn't like

245
00:12:03.175 --> 00:12:05.325
that song I made for you. Santa?

246
00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:07.498
- No. Stuffy. It was very rude.

247
00:12:07.498 --> 00:12:09.846
- Uh! The nerve of you. Big Red.

248
00:12:09.846 --> 00:12:12.387
(somber music)
I'm outta here.

249
00:12:12.387 --> 00:12:15.195
(bells clinking)

250
00:12:15.195 --> 00:12:16.528
- I can't believe Stuffy did that

251
00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:17.835
to your present.
(people chattering)

252
00:12:17.835 --> 00:12:21.117
- Yeah. but we should
be used to it by now.

253
00:12:21.117 --> 00:12:22.253
- Yeah.

254
00:12:22.253 --> 00:12:24.753
Stuffy's been in a really bad mood lately.

255
00:12:24.753 --> 00:12:27.314
- Of course. Isn't he always?

256
00:12:27.314 --> 00:12:30.293
- Yeah. but I wish he
would learn to be kind.

257
00:12:30.293 --> 00:12:32.708
- I wish that too. And
I wish it were soon.

258
00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:35.434
But most likely he'll
never learn to be kind.

259
00:12:35.434 --> 00:12:39.292
Santa says that he was very
naughty when he was a boy.

260
00:12:39.292 --> 00:12:42.286
- Yeah. but love conquers all.

261
00:12:42.286 --> 00:12:44.410
Maybe we should just
go show him some love.

262
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.478
- You're right.

263
00:12:45.478 --> 00:12:46.311
Come on.

264
00:12:49.012 --> 00:12:49.845
(slow jazzy music)

265
00:12:49.845 --> 00:12:51.540
- [Jolly] Hey. Stuffy.
how's your day going?

266
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.129
- How's my day going?

267
00:12:53.129 --> 00:12:54.542
Horrible.

268
00:12:54.542 --> 00:12:56.727
- [Jolly] Wow. you have
a lot of dolls to stuff.

269
00:12:56.727 --> 00:12:58.190
You're really falling behind.

270
00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.641
(tense music)
- Stuff?

271
00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:03.058
When you won Elf of the Year.

272
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:06.494
I vowed to never stuff

273
00:13:08.341 --> 00:13:09.924
another doll again!

274
00:13:15.739 --> 00:13:16.822
You stuff it.

275
00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:21.082
I have an appointment in the bathroom.

276
00:13:21.082 --> 00:13:26.082
(gentle tinkling music)
(wind whistling)

277
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.627
(somber music)

278
00:13:29.627 --> 00:13:30.661
- What's wrong. Stuffy?

279
00:13:30.661 --> 00:13:32.512
- None of your business.

280
00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:34.917
- Come on. you can tell me.

281
00:13:34.917 --> 00:13:37.452
- Why are you always so happy?

282
00:13:37.452 --> 00:13:39.482
- Because it's Christmastime

283
00:13:39.482 --> 00:13:43.768
and Christmas is the time
to be happy. be joyful.

284
00:13:43.768 --> 00:13:47.578
- What am I supposed to do to be happy?

285
00:13:47.578 --> 00:13:50.078
- Maybe you could try smiling.

286
00:13:51.716 --> 00:13:52.716
Bye. Stuffy.

287
00:13:53.653 --> 00:13:55.149
(wind whistling)
(bells clinking)

288
00:13:55.149 --> 00:13:56.732
- Try. try smiling?

289
00:13:59.232 --> 00:14:01.836
(Stuffy grunting)

290
00:14:01.836 --> 00:14:03.074
- I feel kinda bad that Stuffy
(people chattering)

291
00:14:03.074 --> 00:14:05.198
never gets to have a good Christmas.

292
00:14:05.198 --> 00:14:07.673
- Yeah. sometimes I feel like that too.

293
00:14:07.673 --> 00:14:09.313
Maybe we should do something for him.

294
00:14:09.313 --> 00:14:10.248
- Like what?

295
00:14:10.248 --> 00:14:11.594
- We could get him a present.

296
00:14:11.594 --> 00:14:12.703
- Great idea. Happy.

297
00:14:12.703 --> 00:14:14.613
And we can clean up his desk.

298
00:14:14.613 --> 00:14:16.573
And stuff his dolls for him.

You know what. I've been
giving it a lot of thought

316
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:01.654
and they should call it Santa Stuffy

317
00:15:01.654 --> 00:15:06.653
because of all the cookies
he's stuffing down his throat.

318
00:15:06.653 --> 00:15:08.380

319
00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.688
I'm gonna tell him!

Yeah.

- Happy?
(tense music)

323
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.587
Let me at her. let me at her!

324
00:15:17.587 --> 00:15:18.994
I'll show 'em happy.

325
00:15:18.994 --> 00:15:21.265
- Well. Santa. Stuffy keeps saying

326
00:15:21.265 --> 00:15:23.634
that you only stuff your face with cookies

327
00:15:23.634 --> 00:15:26.134
and that you're an overstuffed tomato.

328
00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:29.179
- Why is he saying those
things about me now?

329
00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:30.619
I do love cookies.

330
00:15:30.619 --> 00:15:32.502
- He also said that you
smell like a reindeer.

331
00:15:32.502 --> 00:15:34.919
- This gossiping has to stop.

332
00:15:36.397 --> 00:15:37.984
But I will have a talk with him.

333
00:15:37.984 --> 00:15:39.726

- Oh. no.

351
00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:32.237
Stuffy's acting up again.

Okay. We'll keep an eye on him.

364
00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:17.761
- Hello. everyone.

365
00:17:17.761 --> 00:17:19.041
I brought cookies.

366
00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:19.874
- Oh. yum.

367
00:17:19.874 --> 00:17:21.281
- Thank you. Mrs. Claus.

368
00:17:21.281 --> 00:17:23.121
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

369
00:17:23.121 --> 00:17:25.458
Thank you for working so hard.

370
00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:27.830
- [Jolly] And thank you.
They look delicious.

371
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:28.778
- Hey. Big Bopper.

372
00:17:28.778 --> 00:17:29.876
You wanted to see me?

373
00:17:29.876 --> 00:17:32.209
- Ho. ho. ho. hello. Stuffy.

374
00:17:33.454 --> 00:17:35.487
I heard what you said about me.

375
00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:37.421
- Well. what about it. Santa?

376
00:17:37.421 --> 00:17:41.331
- You said that all I do is
stuff cookies down my throat

377
00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:44.580
and that I look like a plump tomato.

378
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.809
And that I smell like a reindeer.

379
00:17:46.809 --> 00:17:48.971
- You heard I said what?

380
00:17:48.971 --> 00:17:51.792
I wouldn't say anything like that.

381
00:17:51.792 --> 00:17:53.251
I love cookies.

382
00:17:53.251 --> 00:17:54.736
- I didn't bring it to your attention

383
00:17:54.736 --> 00:17:58.357
when you put laxative in security's milk.

384
00:17:58.357 --> 00:18:00.783
No. I didn't say anything to you.

385
00:18:00.783 --> 00:18:02.973
- Okay. okay. maybe I did say

386
00:18:02.973 --> 00:18:05.013
you look like a plump tomato.

387
00:18:05.013 --> 00:18:08.304
- Stuffy. instead of
making toys for children

388
00:18:08.304 --> 00:18:09.804
with a good heart.

389
00:18:11.589 --> 00:18:13.725
you have done nothing but complain.

390
00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:16.485
- You didn't get me on security.

391
00:18:16.485 --> 00:18:19.125
You didn't give me the award this year.

392
00:18:19.125 --> 00:18:23.224
I'm underpaid. I don't
even get minimum wage.

393
00:18:23.224 --> 00:18:24.669
I mean. what do you wanna do?
- I have been patient

394
00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:27.224
with you for years. Stuffy.

395
00:18:27.224 --> 00:18:29.104
- Well what. what about it. Santa?

396
00:18:29.104 --> 00:18:30.136
- You know. Stuffy.

397
00:18:30.136 --> 00:18:33.144
I took you in when you
were just a little boy

398
00:18:33.144 --> 00:18:35.859
and no one wanted you
because you were so naughty.

399
00:18:35.859 --> 00:18:36.714
- Yeah. we know.

400
00:18:36.714 --> 00:18:38.040
We know I'm not a real elf.

401
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.576
Look at this! This is what you give me.

402
00:18:40.576 --> 00:18:43.736
Look at my hair and my beard.

403
00:18:43.736 --> 00:18:46.805
The elves know I'm not real.

404
00:18:46.805 --> 00:18:48.264
And that's why I'm in a bad mood

405
00:18:48.264 --> 00:18:51.798
because I don't even know who I am.

406
00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:55.522
But it's okay. Big Red.
We all know who you are.

407
00:18:55.522 --> 00:18:57.051
We can't miss you.

408
00:18:57.051 --> 00:19:00.512
- Pride commeth before the fall. Stuffy.

409
00:19:00.512 --> 00:19:01.345
I'm sorry.

410
00:19:02.672 --> 00:19:04.381
I'm gonna have to let you go.

411
00:19:04.381 --> 00:19:07.420
- Dad. you can't fire me!
(slow somber music)

412
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.803
I'm an elf!

413
00:19:08.803 --> 00:19:11.046
- Not any longer. Stuffy.

414
00:19:11.046 --> 00:19:11.879
- [Stuffy] Dad!

415
00:19:11.879 --> 00:19:13.221
- Christmas is not for you.

416
00:19:13.221 --> 00:19:15.160
(tense dark music)

417
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.493
- If Christmas isn't for me.

418
00:19:19.203 --> 00:19:21.703
Christmas won't be for anyone!

419
00:19:23.152 --> 00:19:25.526
- Ho. ho. ho. ho. ho!

420
00:19:25.526 --> 00:19:28.174
Have a Merry Christmas. Stuffy.

421
00:19:28.174 --> 00:19:29.695
(Stuffy growling)

422
00:19:29.695 --> 00:19:31.345
- Stuffy. calm down.

423
00:19:31.345 --> 00:19:32.500
I got fired.
- Sorry.

424
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.458
- That's what happened.
(tense music)

425
00:19:33.458 --> 00:19:34.511
Missile-Toe.

426
00:19:34.511 --> 00:19:35.852
I'm outta here.

427
00:19:35.852 --> 00:19:37.435
You stay out of it.

428
00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.735
- What a pity.
(somber music)

429
00:19:43.735 --> 00:19:45.303
but we can't have division here.

430
00:19:45.303 --> 00:19:46.303
- Oh. Santa.

431
00:19:47.476 --> 00:19:49.602
We never had to fire an elf before.

432
00:19:49.602 --> 00:19:52.548
- Christmas is about
celebrating the birth of Christ

433
00:19:52.548 --> 00:19:56.810
and we can't bring joy to
the world with unhappy elves.

434
00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.508
- Don't you think you were
a little harsh with him.

435
00:19:59.508 --> 00:20:02.132
- Maybe I can work something out.

436
00:20:02.132 --> 00:20:03.715
- Where will he go?

437
00:20:07.349 --> 00:20:09.932
(tense music)

438
00:20:13.497 --> 00:20:16.394
- The old laxative trick.
(can rattling)

439
00:20:16.394 --> 00:20:19.512
Security will never see it coming.

468
00:21:38.985 --> 00:21:40.132
- Reporting for duty. Santa.

469
00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:43.020
- How did you let Stuffy
steal the reindeer?

470
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.326
Where were your men?

471
00:21:44.326 --> 00:21:45.880
- Sorry. Santa.

472
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.576
Stuffy switched our milk again.

473
00:21:48.576 --> 00:21:50.335
- You clean yourselves up

474
00:21:50.335 --> 00:21:53.341
and change your pants if you have to.

475
00:21:53.341 --> 00:21:55.524
but you locate him as soon as possible.

476
00:21:55.524 --> 00:21:58.749
- I'll gather my team and
we'll try to locate him.

477
00:21:58.749 --> 00:22:01.811
- And if you don't find
the sleigh and reindeer.

478
00:22:01.811 --> 00:22:03.894
Christmas will be ruined.

479
00:22:04.891 --> 00:22:06.400
- We'll do our very best. sir.

480
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.920
- Hold on. hold on.

481
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.389
You're telling me that
Santa has a security team?

482
00:22:11.389 --> 00:22:14.261
That's not in any of the story books.

483
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:15.463
- [Father] He doesn't go advertising

484
00:22:15.463 --> 00:22:17.268
that sort of thing around.

485
00:22:17.268 --> 00:22:19.156
He's a military man at heart.

486
00:22:19.156 --> 00:22:22.200
Santa didn't make it under the
radar this long for nothing.

487
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.636
You can bet your candy canes
he has a security team.

488
00:22:25.636 --> 00:22:26.476
(suspenseful music)

489
00:22:26.476 --> 00:22:28.602
There's reconnaissance involved.

490
00:22:28.602 --> 00:22:32.116
They need to find out what
kids want for presents.

491
00:22:32.116 --> 00:22:35.602
There's no magic fairy dust here.

492
00:22:35.602 --> 00:22:36.602
Where was I?

493
00:22:37.445 --> 00:22:38.444
Oh yes.

494
00:22:38.444 --> 00:22:41.525
So the team came back empty handed.

495
00:22:41.525 --> 00:22:44.726
Stuffy had escaped their grasp.

496
00:22:44.726 --> 00:22:47.104
Where would Stuffy go?

497
00:22:47.104 --> 00:22:49.741
What was he gonna do?
(insects chirping)

498
00:22:49.741 --> 00:22:51.241
Stuffy had a plan.

499
00:23:09.006 --> 00:23:11.356

(sleigh whooshing)

504
00:23:19.924 --> 00:23:20.757
(somber music)
- What are we gonna do

505
00:23:20.757 --> 00:23:22.432
about Christmas?

506
00:23:22.432 --> 00:23:26.015
- We've been working
so hard all year long.

507
00:23:27.193 --> 00:23:28.129
- And now the children

508
00:23:28.129 --> 00:23:30.449
aren't even gonna get their presents.

509
00:23:30.449 --> 00:23:32.604
- This is making me so sad.

510
00:23:32.604 --> 00:23:35.004
It's making you sad too. Happy.

511
00:23:35.004 --> 00:23:37.337
and you're always happy.

512
00:23:37.337 --> 00:23:39.286
(people chattering)

513
00:23:39.286 --> 00:23:40.786
- Double espresso.

514
00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:43.754
There.

515
00:23:46.147 --> 00:23:47.137
- What?

516
00:23:47.137 --> 00:23:49.467
- You look like the walking dead.

517
00:23:49.467 --> 00:23:50.300
- Uh!
- Oh.

518
00:23:52.266 --> 00:23:53.790
Wait.
(thunder cracking)

519
00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:54.623
That's it.

520
00:23:55.795 --> 00:23:56.628
The dead.

521
00:23:58.227 --> 00:23:59.060
Zombies.

522
00:24:00.938 --> 00:24:02.105
Oh. that's it.

523
00:24:04.188 --> 00:24:06.605
That's how I'll get 'em back.

524
00:24:07.666 --> 00:24:11.833
Zombies.
(tense electronic music)

525
00:24:38.941 --> 00:24:40.524
I'm lost. I'm lost.

526
00:24:42.098 --> 00:24:42.931
Huh.

527
00:24:44.207 --> 00:24:48.374
You're gonna have Stuffy's
personality. my friend.

528
00:24:49.973 --> 00:24:50.806
Power on.

529
00:24:51.897 --> 00:24:52.855
(motor whirring)

530
00:24:52.855 --> 00:24:53.688
Yeah.

531
00:24:55.294 --> 00:24:56.910
(motor whirring)

532
00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:57.743
Okay.

533
00:24:58.582 --> 00:25:01.473
(loud whooshing)
There you go. I know it hurts.

534
00:25:01.473 --> 00:25:04.182
I know it hurts. but
you need to be stuffed

535
00:25:04.182 --> 00:25:06.058
to full capacity. (grunts)

Don't be smart with me.

539
00:25:10.929 --> 00:25:11.762
Okay.

540
00:25:12.853 --> 00:25:13.686
All right.

541
00:25:14.637 --> 00:25:17.101
Quite a grip you have here.

542
00:25:17.101 --> 00:25:20.229
All right. let it go. Let it go.

543
00:25:20.229 --> 00:25:24.420
(electricity buzzing)
He's alive! He's alive!

544
00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.682
(Stuffy shouting)

545
00:25:26.682 --> 00:25:28.960
They'll know that Santa's coming.

546
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.248
(Stuffy screaming)
(electricity buzzing)

547
00:25:31.248 --> 00:25:32.892
(tense music)

548
00:25:32.892 --> 00:25:33.898
- I have a report. sir.

549
00:25:33.898 --> 00:25:36.748
We found out he's creating
an army of zombies.

550
00:25:36.748 --> 00:25:39.021
We also heard loud music
and someone rapping.

551
00:25:39.021 --> 00:25:42.091
He changed locations and
we are unable to find him.

552
00:25:42.091 --> 00:25:44.415
- Oh no. What am I gonna tell Santa?

553
00:25:44.415 --> 00:25:46.166
I have an old friend.

554
00:25:46.166 --> 00:25:48.488
I can call in a favor from him.

555
00:25:48.488 --> 00:25:49.321
- Hey. IQ. you wanna go
(typewriter clacking)

556
00:25:49.321 --> 00:25:50.557
to the shooting range?

557
00:25:50.557 --> 00:25:53.592
(ominous music)

558
00:25:53.592 --> 00:25:56.197
Put the book down for five minutes. man.

559
00:25:56.197 --> 00:25:58.280
- Shh. I'm at the climax.

560
00:26:02.138 --> 00:26:04.805
- Okay. well I'll call Snowflake.

561
00:26:04.805 --> 00:26:05.760
(tense music)

562
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.943
It'll give me a reason to
spend some time with her.

563
00:26:08.943 --> 00:26:12.376
I'll show her who the
best shot around here is.

564
00:26:12.376 --> 00:26:15.709
Certainly not you. You never train. man.

565
00:26:18.491 --> 00:26:20.991
(gun firing)

566
00:26:25.168 --> 00:26:26.409
I take it back.

567
00:26:26.409 --> 00:26:28.409
- I don't need training.

568
00:26:29.346 --> 00:26:31.432
(lively music)
- You get 'em. boy.

569
00:26:31.432 --> 00:26:34.162
You get 'em. go get 'em.

570
00:26:34.162 --> 00:26:37.245
I want Captain Missile-Toe and Santa!

571
00:26:39.351 --> 00:26:40.852
You get your men on this.

572
00:26:40.852 --> 00:26:44.202
♪ It's like Halloween in fall ♪
Go.

573
00:26:44.202 --> 00:26:45.905
♪ Every night they come to call ♪

574
00:26:45.905 --> 00:26:48.475

♪ As the ♪

576
00:26:49.308 --> 00:26:51.662
(phone ringing)
- Gunner. is this you?

577
00:26:51.662 --> 00:26:52.622
- Who's this?

578
00:26:52.622 --> 00:26:54.926
- Remember Christmas of 2004

579
00:26:54.926 --> 00:26:56.909
when you held Santa at gunpoint

580
00:26:56.909 --> 00:27:00.306
for dropping through your chimney?

581
00:27:00.306 --> 00:27:02.020
- Ho. ho. ho. ho!
- Get on the ground!

582
00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.869
- Ho. ho. ho. ho.
- No more. Santa!

583
00:27:03.869 --> 00:27:07.105
- I'm the security captain
who came to talk you down.

584
00:27:07.105 --> 00:27:08.831
- Captain Missile-Toe.

585
00:27:08.831 --> 00:27:09.825
Yes. I remember you.

586
00:27:09.825 --> 00:27:11.671
- We have a situation.

587
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:13.805
I think you might be
able to help us with it.

588
00:27:13.805 --> 00:27:15.021
- What's the situation?

589
00:27:15.021 --> 00:27:18.526
- A disgruntled employee
named Stuffy was fired-

590
00:27:18.526 --> 00:27:19.359
- What?
and he stole

591
00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:20.765
the reindeer and sleigh.

592
00:27:20.765 --> 00:27:23.660
- Why do you need help with
one disgruntled employee?

593
00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.290
- He could be planning to
come back to get revenge.

594
00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:28.874
- Now you're talking my language.

595
00:27:28.874 --> 00:27:30.811
- Yeah. we found this old location

596
00:27:30.811 --> 00:27:32.490
and we were able to bug his building.

597
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.323
- Okay.

598
00:27:33.323 --> 00:27:35.615
- Then he switched locations
and we lost track of him.

599
00:27:35.615 --> 00:27:36.889
- We'll get right on it.

600
00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:38.615
- I knew I could count on you. brother.

601
00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:39.448
Thank you.

602
00:27:39.448 --> 00:27:40.823
- Sergeant Gunner
(lively music)

603
00:27:40.823 --> 00:27:41.656
would have to get

604
00:27:41.656 --> 00:27:44.979
his zombie outbreak
response team together.

605
00:27:44.979 --> 00:27:48.484
starting with his most decorated soldier.

606
00:27:48.484 --> 00:27:50.734
the beautiful. the amazing.

607
00:27:52.004 --> 00:27:55.254
the lone wolf. the cheese on your taco.

608
00:27:56.234 --> 00:27:58.571
a mother of three daughters.

609
00:27:58.571 --> 00:28:01.514
the hair that never gets messed up.

610
00:28:01.514 --> 00:28:04.264
and the makeup that never smears.

611
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.274
- Dad. are you just describing Mom?

612
00:28:08.274 --> 00:28:10.261
- Her name's not Mom.

613
00:28:10.261 --> 00:28:13.761
Her name is Snowflake. Corporal Snowflake.

614
00:28:15.034 --> 00:28:18.075
But yeah. she does have
a striking resemblance

615
00:28:18.075 --> 00:28:19.365
to your mother.

616
00:28:19.365 --> 00:28:20.448
(tense music)

617
00:28:20.448 --> 00:28:24.733
- The battle of robot
bits continues. my friend.

618
00:28:24.733 --> 00:28:26.711
I surely wouldn't choose
the cup in front of you

619
00:28:26.711 --> 00:28:29.296
because you're from New Jersey.

620
00:28:29.296 --> 00:28:32.037
New Jersey is the home of
the first movie theater.

621
00:28:32.037 --> 00:28:35.455
They didn't have any drinks
when they first opened.

622
00:28:35.455 --> 00:28:39.334
But I surely wouldn't choose
the cup in front of me either.

623
00:28:39.334 --> 00:28:40.800
- Why not?

624
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.050
- Because I'm from New York

625
00:28:44.809 --> 00:28:47.173
and it's home of the
New York Cheese Steak.

626
00:28:47.173 --> 00:28:48.429
And a cheese steak's so good

627
00:28:48.429 --> 00:28:50.143
you don't take any drinks
with a cheese steak

628
00:28:50.143 --> 00:28:52.726
'cause then you won't taste it.

629
00:28:56.146 --> 00:28:56.979
Look.

630
00:29:02.827 --> 00:29:04.321
- Oh. Happy.
(somber music)

631
00:29:04.321 --> 00:29:06.222
What's wrong?

632
00:29:06.222 --> 00:29:08.389
- I'm just a little worry.

633
00:29:09.404 --> 00:29:11.352
How are the children
gonna get their presents

634
00:29:11.352 --> 00:29:13.813
if Santa doesn't have
a sleigh and reindeer?

635
00:29:13.813 --> 00:29:16.396
- Oh. there's no need to worry.

636
00:29:17.775 --> 00:29:21.512
Santa will take care of everything.

637
00:29:21.512 --> 00:29:23.106
- Good afternoon. sir.
(tense music)

638
00:29:23.106 --> 00:29:25.392
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

639
00:29:25.392 --> 00:29:28.214
My colleague gave me your file.

640
00:29:28.214 --> 00:29:30.490
I thought we could start off
with maybe an introduction.

641
00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.562
Tell me about your experience.

642
00:29:32.562 --> 00:29:34.075
Start with your name.

643
00:29:34.075 --> 00:29:36.158
- I Am Straight Business.

644
00:29:38.197 --> 00:29:39.265
- That's good.

645
00:29:39.265 --> 00:29:40.781
That is a good quality to have.

646
00:29:40.781 --> 00:29:43.626
We are straight business here.

647
00:29:43.626 --> 00:29:44.736
(suspenseful music)
But if you can

648
00:29:44.736 --> 00:29:47.838
go ahead and start with your name.

649
00:29:47.838 --> 00:29:49.921
- I Am Straight Business.

650
00:29:53.038 --> 00:29:54.326
- That is excellent.

651
00:29:54.326 --> 00:29:57.526
That is very excellent
and outstanding. sir.

652
00:29:57.526 --> 00:29:59.705
that you are straight business.

653
00:29:59.705 --> 00:30:02.038
I am straight business also.

654
00:30:04.656 --> 00:30:05.814
Okay.

655
00:30:05.814 --> 00:30:09.831
Maybe I'll just start with your file then.

656
00:30:09.831 --> 00:30:11.831
It says here that you...

657
00:30:14.611 --> 00:30:18.089
Your name is I'm Straight Business?

658
00:30:18.089 --> 00:30:20.506
- No. I Am Straight Business.

659
00:30:22.261 --> 00:30:23.336
- I apologize. sir.

660
00:30:23.336 --> 00:30:24.804
Okay. Well. it doesn't matter.

661
00:30:24.804 --> 00:30:27.631
Your name doesn't matter. okay?

662
00:30:27.631 --> 00:30:30.281
I see that you do have
the experience I need

663
00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:33.081
and I need another team member fast.

664
00:30:33.081 --> 00:30:36.462
We have Christmas to
save and zombies to hunt.

665
00:30:36.462 --> 00:30:39.221
Are you up for the task?

666
00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:40.254
- Yes. sir.

667
00:30:40.254 --> 00:30:42.260
- And a little word of wisdom. sir.

668
00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.410
before we begin.

669
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.160
Snowflake is with me.

670
00:30:49.769 --> 00:30:51.819
You keep your eyes to yourself

671
00:30:51.819 --> 00:30:52.827
(suspenseful music)

672
00:30:52.827 --> 00:30:57.227
or you'll be fired as
quick as you started.

673
00:30:57.227 --> 00:30:58.060
- Yes. sir.

674
00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.963
(tense music)
- Snowflake.

675
00:30:59.963 --> 00:31:01.885
Having a good day?

676
00:31:01.885 --> 00:31:04.381
Meet your new team member.

677
00:31:04.381 --> 00:31:06.298
I Am Straight Business.

678
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.886
I'll let you two introduce yourself.

679
00:31:10.886 --> 00:31:12.387
but I'm gonna be watching

680
00:31:12.387 --> 00:31:14.574
over here keeping a close eye on you two.

681
00:31:14.574 --> 00:31:16.208
- Guess what. Happy.

682
00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:18.528
Santa found an old sleigh in the barn

683
00:31:18.528 --> 00:31:20.781
and he found a bunch of new reindeer!

684
00:31:20.781 --> 00:31:23.462
- (gasps) Christmas is saved after all.

685
00:31:23.462 --> 00:31:25.554
♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪

686
00:31:25.554 --> 00:31:27.735
♪ Fa la la la la la la la la ♪

687
00:31:27.735 --> 00:31:28.568
- All right. team.
(tense music)

688
00:31:28.568 --> 00:31:29.918
it's mandatory.

689
00:31:29.918 --> 00:31:33.661
Your backup weapon's gonna be a shotgun.

690
00:31:33.661 --> 00:31:37.078
I say this because the new rounds are in.

691
00:31:38.391 --> 00:31:39.724
Zombie stoppers.

692
00:31:41.173 --> 00:31:42.034
- You know. Happy.
(vocalized choral music)

693
00:31:42.034 --> 00:31:44.023
Christmas is all about getting presents

694
00:31:44.023 --> 00:31:46.173
and playing with them.

695
00:31:46.173 --> 00:31:49.634
- Actually. I don't think that's it.

696
00:31:49.634 --> 00:31:51.033
The real reason for the season

697
00:31:51.033 --> 00:31:54.838
is the birth of our Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ.

698
00:31:54.838 --> 00:31:56.817
- Then what's the point of giving gifts?

699
00:31:56.817 --> 00:31:59.241
- Because Jesus was the ultimate gift

700
00:31:59.241 --> 00:32:01.257
and the Kings gave him gifts.

701
00:32:01.257 --> 00:32:03.619
So it's kinda like tradition.

702
00:32:03.619 --> 00:32:05.286
- Oh. thanks. Happy.

703
00:32:06.543 --> 00:32:08.216
- Aren't you a little overprotective?

704
00:32:08.216 --> 00:32:10.073
(emotional music)
- I'm gonna be overprotective.

705
00:32:10.073 --> 00:32:11.411
You see this ring.

706
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:13.845
I pledged myself to you two weeks ago.

707
00:32:13.845 --> 00:32:16.315
Whether you like it or not. I'm all yours.

708
00:32:16.315 --> 00:32:18.056
- I'm not ready.

709
00:32:18.056 --> 00:32:19.022
- You're never gonna be ready.

710
00:32:19.022 --> 00:32:21.165
No risk. no reward.

711
00:32:21.165 --> 00:32:23.584
- Not until you can outshoot me.

712
00:32:23.584 --> 00:32:24.611
- I'll outshoot you right now.

713
00:32:24.611 --> 00:32:26.405
Let's go to the range.

714
00:32:26.405 --> 00:32:28.732
- I need a protector.

715
00:32:28.732 --> 00:32:30.229
- You already said I was overprotective.

716
00:32:30.229 --> 00:32:31.954
That doesn't make any sense.

717
00:32:31.954 --> 00:32:35.594
- (scoffs) Welcome to your
first lesson on women.

718
00:32:35.594 --> 00:32:37.844
I'll meet you at the range.

719
00:32:39.663 --> 00:32:44.663
(rifle firing)
(dynamic music)

720
00:32:45.127 --> 00:32:47.381
(rifle firing)

721
00:32:47.381 --> 00:32:49.002
- That's how it's done.

722
00:32:49.002 --> 00:32:50.752
- That's pretty good.

723
00:32:52.178 --> 00:32:55.298
(rifle firing)

724
00:32:55.298 --> 00:32:56.881
- I think I got it.

725
00:32:58.865 --> 00:33:00.022
- Hold on. Snowflake.

726
00:33:00.022 --> 00:33:01.439
Wait right there.

727
00:33:02.703 --> 00:33:03.887
No. you don't have it.

728
00:33:03.887 --> 00:33:07.137
Let me show you how a real man does it.

729
00:33:08.312 --> 00:33:12.902
(rifle clicking)
(tense music)

730
00:33:12.902 --> 00:33:15.569
(rifle firing)

731
00:33:16.507 --> 00:33:19.007
That's how a real man does it.

732
00:33:20.636 --> 00:33:23.362
- You didn't even get close.

733
00:33:23.362 --> 00:33:25.949
- Kinda close. I got on the target.

734
00:33:25.949 --> 00:33:29.699
- (scoffs) Not close enough.

735
00:33:32.592 --> 00:33:35.328

00:33:35.328 --> 00:33:37.898

737
00:33:37.898 --> 00:33:40.331
- How are you doing that?

738
00:33:40.331 --> 00:33:42.392
I need another round. Give me a round.

739
00:33:42.392 --> 00:33:45.142
(dynamic music)

740
00:33:47.845 --> 00:33:51.678
If I beat your shot. I'm
taking you to dinner.

741
00:34:02.883 --> 00:34:05.412
(rifle firing)

742
00:34:05.412 --> 00:34:07.073
Time for dinner.

743
00:34:07.073 --> 00:34:08.573
- Not yet. cowboy.

744
00:34:09.559 --> 00:34:11.142

748
00:34:19.377 --> 00:34:22.500
- (indistinct) we take on the North Pole!

749
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.530
(tense music)

750
00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:27.791
I have stuffed you for such a time as this

751
00:34:27.791 --> 00:34:30.330
and together. my friends.

752
00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:32.497
Christmas will be no more!

754
00:34:37.591 --> 00:34:40.442
We have three mission objectives.

756
00:34:43.071 --> 00:34:44.202

759
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:55.891
you will tie them up
with Christmas lights.

760
00:34:55.891 --> 00:35:00.229
We will hurt no one.
but we will tie them up

761
00:35:00.229 --> 00:35:02.396
in time to ruin Christmas.

762
00:35:04.451 --> 00:35:06.148
Number three.
(electronics beeping)

763
00:35:06.148 --> 00:35:10.830
and the main target. something
that you cannot miss.

764
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:13.670
something big. overstuffed and red

765
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.190
like a plump tomato.

766
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.857
someone of legend...

767
00:35:18.268 --> 00:35:19.897
Big Red.

768
00:35:19.897 --> 00:35:22.758

00:35:29.528 --> 00:35:31.479
Is anyone listening?

772
00:35:31.479 --> 00:35:33.489
I'm not getting any feedback here.

- Okay. team. I'm here
(suspenseful music)

794
00:36:37.457 --> 00:36:39.759
to brief you on our mission.

795
00:36:39.759 --> 00:36:42.449
Apparently a disgruntled employee

796
00:36:42.449 --> 00:36:46.567
has stolen the sleigh and the
reindeer from the North Pole.

797
00:36:46.567 --> 00:36:49.895
It's up to us to save Christmas.

798
00:36:49.895 --> 00:36:51.728
We have to locate him.

799
00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.596
I have a map in my office

800
00:36:55.596 --> 00:36:58.324
that shows where his hideout is.

801
00:36:58.324 --> 00:36:59.657
They have wiretapped

802
00:36:59.657 --> 00:37:01.740
his hideout and they found out

803
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.591
he's making an army of zombies.

804
00:37:04.591 --> 00:37:07.007
And that's where we come in.

805
00:37:07.007 --> 00:37:09.007
to do what we're good at

806
00:37:09.852 --> 00:37:12.435
and that's eliminating zombies.

807
00:37:14.173 --> 00:37:16.629
Meet me in my office in five minutes.

Are you paying attention?

809
00:37:20.374 --> 00:37:22.013
- Yes.

Loud and clear. Sarge.

811
00:37:25.719 --> 00:37:26.601
- Really?

812
00:37:26.601 --> 00:37:29.876
All right. let's hear the mission.

813
00:37:29.876 --> 00:37:32.965
- We have to go on a mission

814
00:37:32.965 --> 00:37:35.632

- Where is he. where's the elf?

822
00:38:04.542 --> 00:38:05.902
- [Sgt. Gunner] Snowflake.

- Go ahead and show me UTL.

825
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:10.831
There's no sign of 'em.

826
00:38:10.831 --> 00:38:11.664
- [Snowflake] Roger that.

827
00:38:11.664 --> 00:38:12.696

They were after presents.

The elves were having to work overtime.

834
00:38:43.782 --> 00:38:48.121
