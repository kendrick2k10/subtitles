I don'â€™t usually do this.

but I ran out
of a coffee grounds

311

and I was hoping to
maybe steal some of yours.

I didn'â€™t have a chance to
go out earlier and get them.

00:29:39.952 --> 00:29:41.649
and it'â€™d be really great

00:29:41.692 --> 00:29:43.825
if I could have them
for the morning.

That'â€™s interesting.

361
00:32:12.017 --> 00:32:13.757
What are you writing about?

362
00:32:13.801 --> 00:32:15.107
Um. well. I just. I just--

363
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.675
it'â€™s something I've been

364
00:32:18.719 --> 00:32:20.982
just thinking about
for a little while.

365
00:32:21.026 --> 00:32:24.812
I'â€™m actually almost done
with the first draft.

366
00:32:24.855 --> 00:32:27.989
So is the plot
like a secret or...

367
00:32:28.033 --> 00:32:29.817
No. no. it'â€™s not.

368
00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.646
I'â€™m just--I'm pretty terrible.

369
00:32:32.689 --> 00:32:34.387
Uh...

370
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.868
I just--suck at explaining
the shit that I write about.

371
00:32:37.912 --> 00:32:41.568
It'â€™s--wouldn't do it
any justice.

372
00:32:41.611 --> 00:32:44.136
You just kind of
have to read it and then.

373
00:32:44.179 --> 00:32:46.877
and then it makes sense.

374
00:32:46.921 --> 00:32:50.142
Or at least I hope
it makes sense.

375
00:32:50.185 --> 00:32:52.013
Well. uh.

376
00:32:52.057 --> 00:32:55.103
maybe when you'â€™re done
writing it. I could.

377
00:32:55.147 --> 00:32:56.539
I could read it.

378
00:32:56.583 --> 00:32:59.107
Yeah. um. maybe.

379
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:00.979

00:51:22.122 --> 00:51:25.560
â™ª

582
00:51:25.604 --> 00:51:27.432
So did you finish it?

583
00:51:27.475 --> 00:51:29.173
Pardon?

584
00:51:29.216 --> 00:51:30.565
Your script.

585
00:51:30.609 --> 00:51:33.264
Did you finish writing it?

586
00:51:33.307 --> 00:51:35.396
I did.

587
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.442
Actually.
finished it late last night.

588
00:51:37.485 --> 00:51:40.271
â™ª

589
00:51:40.314 --> 00:51:42.882
Hmm.

590
00:51:42.925 --> 00:51:45.841
You must be happy about that.

591
00:51:45.885 --> 00:51:48.453
Yeah. I am.

592
00:51:48.496 --> 00:51:50.542
It'â€™s a bit of a miracle every
time I finish one.

593
00:51:50.585 --> 00:51:52.239
Hm.

594
00:51:56.635 --> 00:51:59.638
So Mr. Screenwriter.

595
00:51:59.681 --> 00:52:01.988
have I possibly seen anything

596
00:52:02.031 --> 00:52:03.990
that you'â€™ve written?

597
00:52:04.033 --> 00:52:06.601
Uh. well. that depends.

598
00:52:06.645 --> 00:52:08.386
Depends on what?

599
00:52:08.429 --> 00:52:12.216
Are you a fan a low budget.
B horror movies

600
00:52:12.259 --> 00:52:17.090
without any discernable stars?

601
00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:21.138
Um. no. not really.

602
00:52:21.181 --> 00:52:23.662
Yeah. then I highly doubt it.

603
00:52:23.705 --> 00:52:25.272
Thank you.

604
00:52:25.316 --> 00:52:26.534
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

605
00:52:26.578 --> 00:52:28.841
[clinking]

606
00:52:30.364 --> 00:52:32.714
Is that it?

607
00:52:32.758 --> 00:52:37.502
Um. yeah. that'â€™s it.

608
00:52:37.545 --> 00:52:39.373
Can I see it?

609
00:52:39.417 --> 00:52:41.158
Yeah. yeah. sure.

610
00:52:41.201 --> 00:52:44.944
â™ª

611
00:52:44.987 --> 00:52:47.903
Ending needs some work but um.

612
00:52:47.947 --> 00:52:52.952
I'â€™m never really totally
satisfied with my writing.

613
00:52:52.995 --> 00:52:54.475
I guess that'â€™s a good thing
though

614
00:52:54.519 --> 00:52:57.086
or wouldn'â€™t really be
a point would there.

615
00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:59.393
A little OCD I guess.

616
00:52:59.437 --> 00:53:01.700
But if I just keep picking apart

617
00:53:01.743 --> 00:53:05.530
I'â€™ll never finish.

618
00:53:05.573 --> 00:53:07.009
Um.

619
00:53:07.053 --> 00:53:10.230
I'â€™m just gonna
check on the food.

620
00:53:10.274 --> 00:53:12.537
Are--Do you want any help?

621
00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:13.886
No. no. no.

622
00:53:13.929 --> 00:53:15.017
You just sit there and relax.

623
00:53:15.061 --> 00:53:18.238
I got everything covered
over here.

624
00:53:19.848 --> 00:53:23.287
So um. what about you?

625
00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:24.462
What about me?

626
00:53:24.505 --> 00:53:26.768
What do you do for a living?

627
00:53:26.812 --> 00:53:29.771
Uh. I'â€™m kind of
between things right now.

628
00:53:29.815 --> 00:53:34.298
Just weighing my options
I guess.

629
00:53:34.341 --> 00:53:38.606
Well. options are always good.

630
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:41.305
Yeah sometimes.

631
00:53:41.348 --> 00:53:45.047
Sometimes not.

632
00:53:46.745 --> 00:53:48.877
I'â€™ll see.

633
00:53:48.921 --> 00:53:52.620
Yeah. I'â€™m sure
you'â€™ll figure it out.

634
00:53:55.841 --> 00:53:59.061
Hey. uh. you can go on and
put some music on if you want.

635
00:53:59.105 --> 00:54:02.717
I have some vinyl
over there on the shelf.

636
00:54:02.761 --> 00:54:05.329
I'â€™m pretty old school
when it comes to music.

637
00:54:05.372 --> 00:54:07.244
And I apologize. I really
thought I was going to be

638
00:54:07.287 --> 00:54:09.289
further ahead
with this before you got here.

639
00:54:09.333 --> 00:54:11.117
No. it'â€™s okay.

640
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.728
Not like either of us
are going anywhere.

641
00:54:13.772 --> 00:54:14.860
Right.

642
00:54:14.903 --> 00:54:16.340
Are you sure I can'â€™t help?

643
00:54:16.383 --> 00:54:18.733
No. no. go on.

644
00:54:18.777 --> 00:54:20.648
Just bear with me.

645
00:54:20.692 --> 00:54:22.128
Okay.

646
00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:31.790
â™ª

647
00:54:48.763 --> 00:54:51.592
So is there anything
in particular music wise

648
00:54:51.636 --> 00:54:54.116
you like?

649
00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:57.816
No. no I'â€™m good
with everything on there.

650
00:54:57.859 --> 00:55:00.253
Um. your choice.

651
00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:03.256
Okay.

652
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.345
I'â€™m interested
to see what you choose.

653
00:55:05.389 --> 00:55:11.133
â™ª

654
00:55:24.364 --> 00:55:28.803
â™ª

655
00:55:28.847 --> 00:55:29.761
[sizzling]

656
00:55:29.804 --> 00:55:31.589
Ah!

657
00:55:31.632 --> 00:55:33.808
â™ª All this time

658
00:55:33.852 --> 00:55:35.114
Are you okay?

659
00:55:35.157 --> 00:55:39.814
â™ª You have been on my mind

660
00:55:39.858 --> 00:55:43.035
â™ª And all the reasons...

661
00:55:45.211 --> 00:55:47.082
â™ª

662
00:55:47.126 --> 00:55:50.390
I'â€™m sorry. I...

663
00:55:50.434 --> 00:55:51.391
I didn'â€™t mean to.

664
00:55:51.435 --> 00:55:54.394
No. no it'â€™s not your fault.

665
00:55:54.438 --> 00:55:57.528
That was just. uh.
I don'â€™t know what that was.

666
00:55:57.571 --> 00:55:59.965
â™ª

667
00:56:00.008 --> 00:56:06.319
I guess you'â€™re not ready
for this.

668
00:56:06.363 --> 00:56:08.321
I'â€™m going to go.

669
00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:11.411
No. no. no.

670
00:56:11.455 --> 00:56:16.068
Uh. I'â€™m sorry. I'm--.

671
00:56:16.111 --> 00:56:17.461
Don'â€™t go.

672
00:56:17.504 --> 00:56:19.419
Please don'â€™t go.

673
00:56:19.463 --> 00:56:20.464
I don'â€™t know what that was.

674
00:56:20.507 --> 00:56:23.249
That was--there was um...

675
00:56:23.292 --> 00:56:24.468
Really. I'â€™m gonna--

676
00:56:24.511 --> 00:56:28.907
No. no. look. look. don'â€™t go.

677
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:33.215
This was. look I'â€™m...

678
00:56:33.259 --> 00:56:37.263
I'â€™m not some fucking
crazy nutcase okay.

679
00:56:37.306 --> 00:56:40.092
That was just--let'â€™s just
wipe that clean. all right?

680
00:56:40.135 --> 00:56:44.444
That didn'â€™t--that didn't happen.

681
00:56:44.488 --> 00:56:47.273
Uh. yeah. please just--

682
00:56:47.316 --> 00:56:52.844
Look. don'â€™t go.

683
00:56:52.887 --> 00:56:56.935
Okay. um yeah.

684
00:56:56.978 --> 00:56:58.937
Yeah. I'â€™ll stay.

685
00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.461
Okay. good. good. yeah.

686
00:57:01.505 --> 00:57:03.245
â™ª

687
00:57:03.289 --> 00:57:09.034
I promise. rest of the night
won'â€™t be like that.

688
00:57:09.077 --> 00:57:11.732
Okay.

689
00:57:17.782 --> 00:57:19.871
All right.

690
00:57:19.914 --> 00:57:21.742
Hope you'â€™re hungry.

691
00:57:21.786 --> 00:57:29.097
â™ª

692
00:57:29.141 --> 00:57:34.320
Look. I just want to apologize
again for earlier.

693
00:57:34.363 --> 00:57:39.499
To be honest.
I haven'â€™t been on a date in...

694
00:57:39.543 --> 00:57:41.849
[chuckling]

695
00:57:41.893 --> 00:57:44.896
...A while.

696
00:57:44.939 --> 00:57:47.812
Yeah. um. I honestly haven'â€™t

697
00:57:47.855 --> 00:57:50.118
been on a date
in a while either.

698
00:57:50.162 --> 00:57:53.252
So can we just
completely start over then?

699
00:57:53.295 --> 00:57:54.688
Pretend that I'â€™m not
some crazy idiot

700
00:57:54.732 --> 00:57:56.516
that you just met?

701
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.692
Well. you'â€™re not an idiot.

702
00:57:58.736 --> 00:58:02.130
But maybe a little crazy.

703
00:58:02.174 --> 00:58:04.393
I'â€™ll take that.

704
00:58:04.437 --> 00:58:08.354
But...

705
00:58:08.397 --> 00:58:10.182
What?

706
00:58:10.225 --> 00:58:12.576
Never mind actually.

707
00:58:12.619 --> 00:58:16.188
No. no. go on. go on.

708
00:58:16.231 --> 00:58:19.887
I was--I was just gonna say that

709
00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:22.542
you know. if you
have something going on

710
00:58:22.586 --> 00:58:27.416
and you need someone to talk to

711
00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:30.158
it'â€™s okay.
you can talk to me about it.

712
00:58:30.202 --> 00:58:33.031
â™ª

713
00:58:33.074 --> 00:58:36.600
No. honestly. honestly.
it'â€™s the script.

714
00:58:36.643 --> 00:58:38.906
I just get
a little too invested.

715
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:40.342
I get a little bit neurotic

716
00:58:40.386 --> 00:58:42.649
and it just kind of snowballs.

717
00:58:42.693 --> 00:58:45.086
I'â€™m all right. trust me.

718
00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:46.087
But we should start eating this

719
00:58:46.131 --> 00:58:48.394
or else it'â€™s going to get cold.

720
00:58:48.437 --> 00:58:52.093
White or dark.

721
00:58:52.137 --> 00:58:54.574
Uh. either or.

722
00:58:54.618 --> 00:58:58.970
â™ª

723
00:58:59.013 --> 00:59:03.583
[chuckling]

724
00:59:03.627 --> 00:59:06.978
Uh. I would'â€™ve never guessed
that in a million years.

725
00:59:07.021 --> 00:59:09.850
Yeah. I know.

726
00:59:09.894 --> 00:59:13.506
True story.

727
00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:18.380
I cannot picture you
in that uniform.

728
00:59:18.424 --> 00:59:21.732
-Just can'â€™t.
-Yeah.

729
00:59:21.775 --> 00:59:25.474
-For like almost two years too.
-Wow.

730
00:59:25.518 --> 00:59:29.435
But I do prefer petroleum
transfer technician.

731
00:59:29.478 --> 00:59:31.872
-to be clear.
-Oh right. oh I'â€™m sorry.

732
00:59:31.916 --> 00:59:34.396
I'â€™m sorry that I offended you.

733
00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:35.963
I'â€™m not offended.
I just want to make sure

734
00:59:36.007 --> 00:59:37.965
-you got it right.
-Right. yeah. yeah.

735
00:59:38.009 --> 00:59:39.663
Yeah and let'â€™s not even
get started

736
00:59:39.706 --> 00:59:41.578
on the strip club
cleaning stint.

737
00:59:41.621 --> 00:59:44.015
That was--that was something.

738
00:59:44.058 --> 00:59:47.235
-When the lights came on.
-Ah. gross.

739
00:59:47.279 --> 00:59:48.628
Yeah. there'â€™s a reason
those places are dark.

740
00:59:48.672 --> 00:59:50.499
So what was your title there?

741
00:59:50.543 --> 00:59:53.415
Uh. I had a few
of them actually.

742
00:59:53.459 --> 00:59:56.854
Tell me them all.

743
00:59:56.897 --> 00:59:59.596
No. No. that'â€™s a bad idea.

744
00:59:59.639 --> 01:00:02.424
We don'â€™t want to get
into details with that one.

745
01:00:02.468 --> 01:00:04.296
Oh yeah. the things I'â€™ve done

746
01:00:04.339 --> 01:00:07.168
to pursue this. uh...

747
01:00:07.212 --> 01:00:12.826
screenwriting
it'â€™d blow your mind.

748
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:15.524
Yeah.

749
01:00:15.568 --> 01:00:17.135
A little more?

750
01:00:17.178 --> 01:00:18.615
I'â€™m okay.

751
01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:21.008
Are you sure?
There'â€™s just a tinch left.

752
01:00:21.052 --> 01:00:23.271
I'â€™m good.

753
01:00:23.315 --> 01:00:26.753
[pouring]

754
01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:33.151
Okay. um.

755
01:00:33.194 --> 01:00:34.282
Your turn.

756
01:00:34.326 --> 01:00:36.328
My turn.

757
01:00:36.371 --> 01:00:38.199
What do you mean?

758
01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:42.334
Well. I feel like I'â€™ve just
been rambling on about myself

759
01:00:42.377 --> 01:00:45.903
and I haven'â€™t heard
anything from you today.

760
01:00:45.946 --> 01:00:49.994
Tell me something

I just thought
I'â€™d invite you over.

769
