Uh…

165
00:07:26.375 --> 00:07:28.167
I read about it before I got here.
because I--

166
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.375
Before I get to places.
I like to. like. read up on it.

167
00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:32.000
You do the same thing. don't you?

168
00:07:32.083 --> 00:07:33.292
-No.
-[Kyla] Marcus!

169
00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:35.792
How the hell did you get us in here?

170
00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:37.250
I was talking shop with the manager.

171
00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:39.792
He said this is booked out
five years in advance.

172
00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:41.375
He-- He said five years. huh?

173
00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:44.000
I guess-- [chuckling] I guess I was lucky.
You know?

174
00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:46.375
It's so weird how lucky you get sometimes.

175
00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:48.292
Mm-hmm. Very weird. ain't it. baby?

176
00:07:48.792 --> 00:07:50.542
You know.
so I'm about to go take a shower.

177
00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:52.958
because I feel a little funky
sitting on that plane.

178
00:07:53.042 --> 00:07:55.167
Whoa. hey. Marcus. I just opened this.

179
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.458
Bruh. look.
you gotta pace yourself. brother.

180
00:07:57.542 --> 00:07:58.708
We got five days here.

181
00:07:58.792 --> 00:08:01.708
This is
12-year-old El Mirador Grand Reserve.

182
00:08:01.792 --> 00:08:05.333
This bottle of rum is like 700 bucks.
And there's a note attached.

183
00:08:05.417 --> 00:08:07.750
"Thank you for being so accommodating.
Compliments of the group."

184
00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:09.750
[gasps] I love compliments.
and I love rum.

185
00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:11.083
And I love compliments.

186
00:08:11.167 --> 00:08:13.208
Given the information in front of you.
is there any scenario

187
00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:15.375
where we don't drink this rum
right fucking now?

188
00:08:15.458 --> 00:08:17.292
He does have a point. baby.

189
00:08:17.875 --> 00:08:19.500
-[huffs]
-Yeah.

190
00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:22.125
All-- All right. Yeah. okay. one shot.

191
00:08:22.208 --> 00:08:24.125
If we do one shot.
it can't kill us. right?

192
00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:25.833
Shots. shots. shots. shots!

193
00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:29.333
[Kyla] Whoo!

194
00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:32.083
-Cheers! Fuck it.
-Whoo!

195
00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:34.292
-[Emily] Yeah! Ah!
-[Ron] Mmm.

196
00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:36.042
[crowd cheering]

197
00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:38.083
[Emily] Yeah. I made it!

198
00:08:46.083 --> 00:08:48.500
-[crowd cheering]
-Yeah!

199
00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:50.417
-[Kyla] Whoo!
-[Ron grunts]

200
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.333
To everyone here! To everyone!

201
00:08:54.375 --> 00:08:56.167
-[crowd cheering]
-[Emily] Yeah!

202
00:08:59.875 --> 00:09:01.667
-[Ron] Yeah!
-[Kyla] Whoo!

203
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.125
[no audible dialogue]

204
00:09:09.042 --> 00:09:10.708
[Ron exhaling]

205
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.875
-I fucking love you!
-I fucking love you! [shouts]

206
00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:19.750
[retches]

207
00:09:22.167 --> 00:09:24.625
[shouts]

208
00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:26.458
What?

209
00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.125
[Maurillio] Here you are.

210
00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:37.625
-Sort of.
-Hmm?

211
00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:40.250
-I was wondering where you ended up.
-[baby coos]

212
00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:42.333
-Did we-- Did we sleep out here?
-[Kyla] Oh!

213
00:09:42.417 --> 00:09:44.708
-[groans] We should get some brunch going.
-[groans]

214
00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:46.583
-Ooh. a menu!
-Oh. my baby!

215
00:09:46.667 --> 00:09:48.417
Oh. come here. sweetheart.

216
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.167
-[Emily] Oh. God…
-Thank you for watching him last night.

217
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.542
Hi!

218
00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:53.750
Aw.

219
00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:55.917
Man. we went hard last night.

220
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.333
You should've seen Mommy talk her way
out of getting arrested last night.

221
00:09:59.417 --> 00:10:01.292
You would've been so proud.

222
00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:04.583
You guys. you thinking conch fritters
or something from the smoothie family?

223
00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:07.875
-Baby. something definitely fried.
-No. I want something healthy.

224
00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.208
I'll take a smoothie. please.

225
00:10:09.292 --> 00:10:10.333
-[Ron] Okay.
-I'm with her.

226
00:10:10.417 --> 00:10:11.625
-[Emily groans]
-Let's go healthy.

227
00:10:11.708 --> 00:10:13.458
-Why don't you make it two--
-[Ron] Okay.

228
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.417
-What? Oh… Just someone…
-[Kyla sighs]

229
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.292
[Ron] Ah. oh… See anybody in there? No?

230
00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:24.000
[Kyla] Yeah. I don't see anybody.

231
00:10:24.083 --> 00:10:27.167
-[Ron] Hmm. Just gotta find a waiter.
-[cell phone vibrating]

232
00:10:28.792 --> 00:10:32.958
[Ron] Oh. there-- I'm just gonna
send my vibes. I'm just gonna-- Nope…

233
00:10:33.042 --> 00:10:34.042
Zeke. what's up?

234
00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:36.083
First of all.
there's nothing to worry about.

235
00:10:36.167 --> 00:10:38.125
Yeah. man. everything's totally fine.

236
00:10:38.208 --> 00:10:40.292
Every time y'all say shit like this.
something fucked up has happened.

237
00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:42.208
Have you not checked your phone?

238
00:10:42.292 --> 00:10:45.000
We've been trying to reach you
for the last 24 hours.

239
00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:47.083
Yo. did you turn your notifications off
or something?

240
00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:49.042
Look. I don't know.
Maybe I did. What's up?

241
00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:52.750
The meeting with the CEO. Mrs. Kim?
It got moved up.

242
00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:54.875
She's flying in this Tuesday.

243
00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:55.958
Wha-- Whoa. whoa. whoa.

244
00:10:56.042 --> 00:10:57.583
-[Kyla] Oh. God.
-Why would they do that?

245
00:10:57.667 --> 00:11:00.917
All right. motherfuckers! What do we want?
We want breakfast coladas?

246
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.167
[Zeke] No idea. man. But I guess all of
the executives landed there this morning.

247
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.875
Lucky you're already out there. right?

248
00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.042
-Right there.
-No. no. no. No. no. no. Shit!

249
00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:10.542
-You okay?
-[Zeke] Brother. chill.

250
00:11:10.625 --> 00:11:14.083
We called to tell you we got you covered.
We even overnighted you the handouts.

251
00:11:14.167 --> 00:11:16.125
That's right.
No need to thank us or anything.

252
00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:19.208
I don't wanna thank y'all. Fuck y'all.
Look-- Whoa. Damn. Fuck. Fuck!

253
00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:24.458
Oh. you must be Mr. Parker.

254
00:11:24.542 --> 00:11:26.042
Fuck yes. he is.

255
00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:27.750
Ah! Ron. no.

256
00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:28.958
Yeah. But he's right.

257
00:11:29.042 --> 00:11:31.833
I am-- I-- I am Mr. Parker.

258
00:11:31.917 --> 00:11:33.083
My name is Goe.

259
00:11:33.167 --> 00:11:36.042
I'm from the advance team
for the Kim Wae Group.

260
00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:38.292
Wait. Are you the Kim Wae people--

261
00:11:38.375 --> 00:11:40.458
-Like is this your hotel?
-Mm-hmm.

262
00:11:40.542 --> 00:11:42.375
Okay. because I. for one.
really need to tell you

263
00:11:42.458 --> 00:11:44.458
how much fucking ass this place kicks!

264
00:11:44.542 --> 00:11:45.667
No. no. no. Hey. hey. stop!

265
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.792
I mean. I love hotels.
I'm relaxed. I'm horny.

266
00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:48.875
I'm relaxed. I'm horny…

267
00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.833
-[scoffs] Sit down.
-…after a day in the sun. or three.

268
00:11:50.917 --> 00:11:53.042
-It's amazing.
-Y-You're not hiring. are you?

269
00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:57.583
[Marcus] Look. don't pay them no mind.
I'm sorry. Yes. How-- How can I help you?

270
00:11:57.667 --> 00:12:01.542
We merely wanted to extend our apologies
for the change in schedule.

271
00:12:01.625 --> 00:12:04.333
Again. thank you
for being so accommodating.

272
00:12:04.417 --> 00:12:05.917
Accommodating? Wait.

273
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.708
The rum. The rum was from you.

274
00:12:07.792 --> 00:12:09.750
Yes. I hope you enjoyed it.

275
00:12:09.833 --> 00:12:11.500
Oh. enjoyed it? I mean--

276
00:12:11.583 --> 00:12:13.542
Wait. Was I on fire last night?

277
00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:14.750
Just your head. babe.

278
00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:15.708
You-- Don't listen.

279
00:12:15.792 --> 00:12:17.250
-They just be playing. [laughs]
-[Goe] Oh.

280
00:12:17.333 --> 00:12:18.708
And you know something?

281
00:12:18.792 --> 00:12:20.917
We was getting kind of busy.
'cause we about to get breakfast.

282
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.750
So if we can catch up later today.
that would be…

283
00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:27.542
-[blows] That'd be perfect.
-[Goe] Oh. we hope to catch up tonight.

284
00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:31.958
Mr. Yeon. who is the lead on the Chicago
project. is very eager to meet with you

285
00:12:32.042 --> 00:12:33.583
before Mrs. Kim arrives.

286
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.542
Mr. Yeon is our most senior
vice president.

287
00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:40.375
He's invited you for drinks
down at the lagoon tonight as our guests.

288
00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:42.208
All of you.

289
00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:46.083
-You don't have to invite all of us.
-[Goe] No. no. no. no. It's our pleasure.

290
00:12:47.542 --> 00:12:49.042
We insist.

291
00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:50.375
[sighs]

292
00:12:50.458 --> 00:12:54.125
Appreciate it. That's right.
We'll-- We'll be at the lagoon tonight.

293
00:12:55.917 --> 00:12:57.333
[Ron] What was that all about?

294
00:12:57.417 --> 00:13:00.125
I'm just confused.

295
00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:02.792
Marcus. why don't you just tell them?

296
00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:04.083
Tell us?

297
00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:06.542
Tell us what?

298
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.250
Fuck!

299
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.917
[Marcus] Okay. again.
This is a big deal for me and my company.

300
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So. everybody just please.
please be presentable.

301
00:13:19.083 --> 00:13:22.250
Ah. speaking of. Hold on. [chuckles]

302
00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.000
I knew I should've packed more clothes.

303
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.750
Back to the baby carrier.

304
00:13:27.292 --> 00:13:28.417
-Oh? Oh!
-[Kyla] Oh!

305
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.250
-Thanks. Maurillio!
-Maurillio. you're the best.

306
00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:33.333
-Baby. just get a drink.
-No. I don't wanna have a drink. baby.

307
00:13:33.417 --> 00:13:35.625
-I am hungover. and I'm nervous.
-[sighs]

308
00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:37.417
This isn't how
I pictured things going at all.

309
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.542
-Okay. can you remember something for me?
-Thank you.

310
00:13:39.625 --> 00:13:42.042
That you are personable.
you are charismatic.

311
00:13:42.125 --> 00:13:43.667
and you are damn good at your job.

312
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:48.042
Baby. I know. I know. I know I'm good.
but I have to be the best. okay?

313
00:13:48.125 --> 00:13:49.125
Picture your dick.

314
00:13:51.042 --> 00:13:52.167
-Oh. yeah.
-[Kyla] Mmm.

315
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.000
Wait. what?

316
00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:56.458
It's exactly what we did
when we prepared for battle.

317
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.083
Visualize to achieve.

318
00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:01.208
Marcus. you got more talent
in the tip of your dick hole

319
00:14:01.292 --> 00:14:03.208
than everybody at this entire party.

320
00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:05.500
I'm actually visualizing it right now.

321
00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:08.250
And. wow. it's a gorgeous dick.

322
00:14:08.333 --> 00:14:11.000
Stop it! Cut the shit.

323
00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:12.458
Stop it!

324
00:14:12.542 --> 00:14:15.625
I talked to y'all earlier. and I thought
y'all heard me loud and clear.

325
00:14:15.708 --> 00:14:19.167
I don't want you talking to nobody.
I don't want you making eye contact.

326
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.833
and I especially don't want you
talking about my damn dick. okay?

327
00:14:22.917 --> 00:14:24.000
Ah. excuse me?

328
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.958
Hi. You must be Marcus Parker?

329
00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:31.042
I'm Yeon. VP of properties at Kim Wae.

330
00:14:31.625 --> 00:14:33.625
Oh. [chuckles]

331
00:14:33.708 --> 00:14:34.708
[stammers] You're Yeon.

332
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.417
First of all. what I was just--
What you was just hearing.

333
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.958
that was me. uh. being funny.
You know. I was--

334
00:14:41.042 --> 00:14:44.375
I was just playing around with my friends.
You know. it's a little American humor.

335
00:14:44.458 --> 00:14:45.333
Oh. right. [chuckles]

336
00:14:45.917 --> 00:14:47.625
I went to college in Pittsburgh.

337
00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:50.375
I must've missed the class
on American humor.

338
00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:54.083
Damn. Uh. well.
I own a construction company.

339
00:14:54.167 --> 00:14:56.625
-I'm not a stand-up comic. so maybe I--
-Clearly.

340
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.167
But check this out.

341
00:14:59.667 --> 00:15:02.542
I am excited to meet Mrs. Kim.

342
00:15:02.625 --> 00:15:05.500
When I tell you
this presentation is perfect.

343
00:15:05.583 --> 00:15:08.208
-I've been working on it for months--
-Mr. Parker. I'm-I'm sorry.

344
00:15:08.292 --> 00:15:09.583
Let me stop you right there.

345
00:15:09.667 --> 00:15:12.083
-Can I be honest with you?
-Of course you can.

346
00:15:12.167 --> 00:15:15.167
You are not my first choice for this job.

347
00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:18.500
-What?
-It's nothing personal.

348
00:15:18.583 --> 00:15:22.125
We just already have another candidate
we've worked with before.

349
00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:24.917
He's a real no-brainer. honestly.

350
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.125
So. I don't know why
Mrs. Kim is making us go through this.

351
00:15:29.208 --> 00:15:32.250
Frankly. I find this whole thing
a little insulting.

352
00:15:33.417 --> 00:15:34.417
Is it…

353
00:15:35.042 --> 00:15:38.583
[chuckles] Is it insulting for you.
or is it insulting for me?

354
00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:41.750
Ah. for both of us.

355
00:15:44.042 --> 00:15:47.292
-Goddamn. that was honest. Okay.
-Anyway. nice to meet you.

356
00:15:49.125 --> 00:15:50.750
[stammers] Zero overages!

357
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.458
Sorry. what?

358
00:15:53.542 --> 00:15:57.125
We took on 12 major projects last year
and had zero overages.

359
00:15:57.708 --> 00:15:59.125
-Really?
-Y-Yes.

360
00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:03.542
Uh. and I'm Emily. Marcus's wife.
And I can attest to that.

361
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.292
And you are?

362
00:16:08.208 --> 00:16:09.208
Um…

363
00:16:09.792 --> 00:16:11.042
Um…

364
00:16:11.792 --> 00:16:13.208
I'm Kyla.

365
00:16:14.167 --> 00:16:16.500
And I am Ron.

366
00:16:16.583 --> 00:16:19.833
And you work with him. or…

367
00:16:19.917 --> 00:16:21.333
[Kyla] Mm-mmm.

368
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.208
-[Ron clears throat]
-[Kyla] Mm-hmm.

369
00:16:24.292 --> 00:16:25.333
[in Korean]

370
00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:29.458
[in English] Oh. you can speak Korean?

371
00:16:29.542 --> 00:16:31.000
[Ron. in Korean]

372
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.417
[in English] And I second that.
but make it a double.

373
00:16:50.333 --> 00:16:53.833
That was… esoteric.

374
00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:59.792
-But oddly impressive. As are you both.
-[giggling. speaks softly] Ooh. thanks.

375
00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:06.208
When the wind is right.
we will be releasing these lanterns.

376
00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:08.292
The flame represents happiness

377
00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:09.875
and good luck.

378
00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:13.708
Whew. Wow.

379
00:17:13.792 --> 00:17:15.458
[stammers] Ron. first of all.
thank you. man.

380
00:17:15.542 --> 00:17:17.167
How do you always pull that off?

381
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.542
Okay. I'm going to let you in
on a secret. Marcus.

382
00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:22.208
I don't know if you've noticed.

383
00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:24.458
Everybody likes me.

384
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.917
Come on now. Everybody?

385
00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:29.375
No. I'm serious.

386
00:17:29.458 --> 00:17:31.417
-[sighs]
-Every single person I have ever met.

387
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.583
[giggles]
The crazy thing is he likes them all back.

388
00:17:34.667 --> 00:17:35.792
-Right?
-Oh. yeah.

389
00:17:35.875 --> 00:17:37.917
Okay. well. you can't possibly
like everybody back--

390
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.500
No. Emily. I do.

391
00:17:41.042 --> 00:17:42.750
Every single person.

392
00:17:42.833 --> 00:17:44.792
-Every single person in the entire--
-What? Fucking hell!

393
00:17:44.875 --> 00:17:47.833
What's wrong with you people?
Come on. What are you doing?

394
00:17:47.917 --> 00:17:49.875
I'm-- I'm an invited guest.

395
00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:53.042
Okay. I'm not invited invited.
I'm just looking for somebody.

396
00:17:53.125 --> 00:17:55.875
-Okay. handsome. what's it gonna be?
-[Maurillio] What's up with that guy?

397
00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.458
Fifty. a hunny? Now you tell me.

398
00:17:57.542 --> 00:18:00.375
-You've got to be kidding me.
-[guest] What's wrong with you people?

399
00:18:00.458 --> 00:18:02.167
-No. No!
-[waiter] I gotta do my job.

400
00:18:02.875 --> 00:18:07.500
No. no. no. no. no!
What the fuck are you doing here?

401
00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:08.667
Fuck you. lady!

402
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.125
Fuck me? Fuck you!
Get the fuck out of here!

403
00:18:11.208 --> 00:18:13.792
[chuckles] What? Are you going to make me?
What are you gonna do?

404
00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:15.083
I'll fucking kick your ass.

405
00:18:15.167 --> 00:18:17.083
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

406
00:18:17.167 --> 00:18:18.625
-Ooh…
-Ooh…

407
00:18:20.292 --> 00:18:23.417
Dad! Oh. my God! [chuckles]

408
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.708
Oh. my God!

409
00:18:24.792 --> 00:18:27.250
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-Wait. What?

410
00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:28.958
What do you mean what am I doing here?

411
00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:32.000
-That's her dad? I thought he was in jail.
-So did I.

412
00:18:32.083 --> 00:18:33.958
I'm glad you're here.
These guys wouldn't let me in.

413
00:18:34.042 --> 00:18:36.208
-Fuck you! And fuck you!
-What's going on with this place.

414
00:18:36.292 --> 00:18:37.500
-Dad!
-[laughs]

415
00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:40.292
Shit. that's Reese.
I'm finally gonna meet Reese.

416
00:18:40.375 --> 00:18:41.625
Emily. how do I look?

417
00:18:41.708 --> 00:18:43.333
-[Kyla laughs]
-What?

418
00:18:43.417 --> 00:18:45.125
Guys. look who it is! It's my dad!

419
00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:46.667
One-- One second. one second.

420
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.875
Don't say another word. Marcus. right?

421
00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:49.958
Am I right? Oh!

422
00:18:50.042 --> 00:18:52.417
Fuck right off. You must be Emily!
[laughs]

423
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.500
[Reese] Maurillio.

424
00:18:53.583 --> 00:18:55.125
Oho! That mustache!

425
00:18:55.208 --> 00:18:57.792
-It's even better than Kyla said.
-Oh. thank you.

426
00:18:57.875 --> 00:19:01.500
Whoa! He's got your eyes.
The most beautiful eyes in the world.

427
00:19:01.583 --> 00:19:04.250
-Well. Dad. you haven't seen these eyes.
-[coos. chuckles]

428
00:19:04.333 --> 00:19:07.625
I want to introduce you to Ron.

429
00:19:12.083 --> 00:19:13.083
This is Ron?

430
00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:16.292
Kylie. you didn't say
he was a fucking gorilla.

431
00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:18.833
-[chuckles] Well. he's my fucking gorilla.
-Oh!

432
00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:22.542
Dad. he's my soul mate.
He's the love of my life.

433
00:19:22.625 --> 00:19:24.917
Hold on.
I thought I was the love of your life.

434
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.125
Well. now I have two.

435
00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:29.125
Oh. Mr. Hackford.
Can-- Can I call you Reese?

436
00:19:29.917 --> 00:19:33.500
Whew. I cannot tell you
what an honor it is to finally meet you.

437
00:19:38.708 --> 00:19:40.208
Salaam.

438
00:19:41.292 --> 00:19:44.500
Uh. a kiss on the forehead.
That's the ultimate sign of respect.

439
00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.917
-Learned that from a sheikh in Kuwait.
-[Emily] Mmm.

440
00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:49.208
Okay. Ron.

441
00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:52.500
It's nice to finally…

442
00:19:52.583 --> 00:19:53.583
Blah. blah. blah.

443
00:19:54.417 --> 00:19:55.750
Don't worry. I approve.

444
00:19:57.167 --> 00:19:58.375
Or do I?

445
00:20:00.458 --> 00:20:03.750
-[laughing]
-[laughing] Did you see his face?

446
00:20:03.833 --> 00:20:05.042
[laughing] That was good.

447
00:20:05.125 --> 00:20:06.000
Goddamn it.

448
00:20:06.083 --> 00:20:07.792
-I can't believe I'm actually here.
-Yeah.

449
00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:09.708
-Yeah. you know. neither can we.
-Yeah. man.

450
00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:12.000
It's crazy that you-- That you're here.

451
00:20:12.083 --> 00:20:15.042
I mean. if you don't mind me asking.
why you-- why are you here?

452
00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:17.083
Guys. this is so fucking crazy.

453
00:20:17.167 --> 00:20:20.208
He was literally just released
from San Quentin.

454
00:20:20.292 --> 00:20:22.458
Just yesterday. Perfect timing. right?

455
00:20:22.542 --> 00:20:24.125
So. wait. Kyla. you told him to come here?

456
00:20:24.208 --> 00:20:27.250
No. I mean. all I told him was. like.
the hotel we were staying at

457
00:20:27.333 --> 00:20:29.583
and then. classic my Dad.
completely surprised us.

458
00:20:29.667 --> 00:20:33.375
Look. I have missed all the big events
in Kyla's life.

459
00:20:33.458 --> 00:20:37.417
You know. the birth of her kid. wedding.
graduation from CoolSculpting school--

460
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.500
That one hurt.

461
00:20:38.583 --> 00:20:40.083
And her mom's death.

462
00:20:40.167 --> 00:20:42.833
May Jesus rest her beautiful.
precious. lovely soul.

463
00:20:42.917 --> 00:20:44.417
God. I hated that witch.

464
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.708
So after all that. I had no choice.

465
00:20:46.792 --> 00:20:48.833
-I had to come crash her honeymoon.
-Right?

466
00:20:48.917 --> 00:20:52.792
-[chuckles] We are so glad you did.
-[Marcus] Can I tell you something though?

467
00:20:52.875 --> 00:20:57.333
This particular honeymoon is not the type
of honeymoon that you "crash."

468
00:20:57.417 --> 00:21:00.833
If you're worried about your. like.
"business stuff." please do not be.

469
00:21:00.917 --> 00:21:03.208
Because honestly. we're cool.
My dad's even cooler.

470
00:21:03.292 --> 00:21:04.708
Yeah. no. I'll be cool.

471
00:21:04.792 --> 00:21:06.917
Now where can an asshole like me
get a drink around here?

472
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
-We need to get him a drink!
-I gotta work the room.

473
00:21:09.083 --> 00:21:11.042
-I'm going to the bar.
-No. no. Hey. brother.

474
00:21:11.125 --> 00:21:14.083
It's-- You don't wanna go that way.
We got liquor for you.

475
00:21:14.167 --> 00:21:15.917
-We got some rum. In the room.
-In the room.

476
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.250
-No. we don't.
-No. We-- We drank it.

477
00:21:18.333 --> 00:21:19.958
-We get another bottle of rum…
-Yeah.

478
00:21:20.042 --> 00:21:21.250
…just for you to celebrate.

479
00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:23.875
-We're gonna celebrate him.
-Marcus. it's $700.

480
00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:26.000
It's $700. It's on me. It's on me.

481
00:21:26.083 --> 00:21:27.708
We gonna get another bottle for you on me.

482
00:21:27.792 --> 00:21:29.250
-Classy guy here.
-I know!

483
00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:30.583
-[laughs] All right.
-Okay. let's go.

484
00:21:30.667 --> 00:21:31.833
[Kyla] He's very nice.

485
00:21:31.917 --> 00:21:33.625
Thanks. Marcus. That's sweet.

486
00:21:33.708 --> 00:21:36.042
[shouting] Who also needs drinks?

487
00:21:45.375 --> 00:21:49.708
[laughing] Dad. you're so funny.
I mean. come on though.

488
00:21:49.792 --> 00:21:52.125
-You're such a cutie-pie.
-[baby Marcus cooing]

489
00:21:53.417 --> 00:21:54.875
[Kyla] You guys are so cute.

490
00:21:55.458 --> 00:21:56.708
[Reese] Okay.

491
00:21:56.792 --> 00:21:59.458
Oh. the rum is here.
I know where this is headed.

492
00:21:59.542 --> 00:22:00.542
[Reese chuckles]

493
00:22:01.167 --> 00:22:02.417
[Ron] Don't tell me. Reese.

494
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.000
-You're a guy that likes it straight up.
-Nah. I'll just have a beer.

495
00:22:05.083 --> 00:22:06.542
A beer?

496
00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:09.833
So. Reese.
Um. you know. I hate to be intrusive…

497
00:22:09.917 --> 00:22:11.917
Oh. ask away. Open book here.

498
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.292
So what were you in for?

499
00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:15.083
[scoffs] Nothing.

500
00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:18.125
Absolutely nothing.
I'm an innocent victim of the system.

501
00:22:18.208 --> 00:22:21.292
Okay. come on now.
You had to do something to go in.

502
00:22:21.375 --> 00:22:22.375
Here's a cold one. Reese.

503
00:22:22.458 --> 00:22:25.458
All right.
let me put it to you this way. Marcus.

504
00:22:25.542 --> 00:22:27.875
Kyla tells me you own
your own construction company. right?

505
00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:30.250
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay. imports. exports.

506
00:22:30.333 --> 00:22:33.083
And so I get a little aggressive
with some tax write-offs.

507
00:22:33.167 --> 00:22:36.292
and all of a sudden I'm money laundering
with criminal intent?

508
00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:37.792
Bullshit.

509
00:22:37.875 --> 00:22:42.208
And now I have to make up
for eight fucking years of lost time.

510
00:22:42.292 --> 00:22:43.625
Aw…

511
00:22:43.708 --> 00:22:47.667
Speaking of.
I got you the best wedding presents ever.

512
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.333
-My God. Give it to me.
-No. honey-- Okay.

513
00:22:49.417 --> 00:22:52.208
-I know how great you are with money.
-She's the best with money.

514
00:22:52.292 --> 00:22:53.625
Yeah. Ron. I just said that.

515
00:22:53.708 --> 00:22:56.792
But you have a family now. right?
With a kid to take care of.

516
00:22:56.875 --> 00:23:00.083
And you gotta start thinking
about your long-term financial security.

517
00:23:00.167 --> 00:23:01.833
-Right.
-Don't ask me how.

518
00:23:01.917 --> 00:23:07.333
but I got you in on an amazing.
rock-solid investment opportunity.

519
00:23:07.417 --> 00:23:08.917
-Ready?
-Yes.

520
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.083
Crypto.

521
00:23:10.167 --> 00:23:11.750
I'm sorry. What?

522
00:23:11.833 --> 00:23:14.083
-Oh. cryptocurrency.
-No. I know what that is. but--

523
00:23:14.167 --> 00:23:15.542
Dad. I've heard of that.

524
00:23:15.625 --> 00:23:17.708
-Yeah. so have I.
-No. no. you haven't. No. no.

525
00:23:17.792 --> 00:23:20.333
-This is SCOM-coin.
-Did you say Scam-coin?

526
00:23:20.417 --> 00:23:21.625
No. SCOM-coin.

527
00:23:21.708 --> 00:23:24.833
-Scum-coin?
-No. no. no. S-C-O-M.

528
00:23:24.917 --> 00:23:26.458
Yeah. it's an acronym.

529
00:23:26.542 --> 00:23:27.708
-For what?
-For what?

530
00:23:27.792 --> 00:23:29.417
Fuck. I don't remember. [chuckles]

531
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.750
But anyway. it's gonna be huge. Okay?

532
00:23:32.833 --> 00:23:36.250
All you gotta do is give me
like 40. 50 grand and boom!

533
00:23:36.333 --> 00:23:38.125
You are going to be so fucking rich
in no time.

534
00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:40.417
Dad. I'm crying. This is so sweet.

535
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.250
It's the best wedding present ever.

536
00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:44.542
Okay. so I actually work in finance.

537
00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:46.125
Yeah. And I--

538
00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:48.167
I know you guys may think
I'm a little conservative.

539
00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:52.083
but the last time I checked.
cryptocurrency is insanely volatile.

540
00:23:52.167 --> 00:23:54.708
Yeah. They're awesome. [chuckles]

541
00:23:54.792 --> 00:23:57.125
Hey. trust me.
You're gonna want a piece of this.

542
00:23:57.208 --> 00:24:00.125
-Emily. trust him.
-[Emily] Oh.

543
00:24:00.208 --> 00:24:01.875
[Kyla] Also. I have a fun idea.

544
00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:03.958
-Emily. why don't we do it together?
-Yes!

545
00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:05.792
Oh. and Marcus.
I could tell the Koreans about it.

546
00:24:05.875 --> 00:24:07.625
-No. no. No.
-[Reese] It might help you out.

547
00:24:07.708 --> 00:24:10.458
Can we talk about--
We can talk-- We need to talk.

548
00:24:10.542 --> 00:24:11.750
-We should.
-Now we gonna talk.

549
00:24:12.375 --> 00:24:14.625
But you don't talk to nobody else
about this shit.

550
00:24:14.708 --> 00:24:16.208
Yeah. no. Okay. okay.

551
00:24:16.292 --> 00:24:17.583
-I'ma tell you this.
-T-Tell me--

552
00:24:17.667 --> 00:24:20.250
I want you to hear me.
I do not trust Kyla's daddy for nothing.

553
00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:23.583
Who goes to jail for eight years for.
what. tax write-offs?

554
00:24:23.667 --> 00:24:25.000
He went to San Quentin. Come on.

555
00:24:25.083 --> 00:24:27.125
You don't go to San Quentin
for no tax shit.

556
00:24:27.208 --> 00:24:29.750
-We should know 'cause we from Chicago.
-Exactly.

557
00:24:29.833 --> 00:24:32.167
You know he gonna stay here.
You know he plans on staying here.

558
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.250
What was I supposed to do?

559
00:24:33.333 --> 00:24:35.083
I couldn't have him bro-ing it up
with the Koreans.

560
00:24:35.167 --> 00:24:38.208
You know what? Matter of fact.
this motherfucker didn't even try the rum.

561
00:24:38.292 --> 00:24:39.708
Hold up. Did we pay for that rum?

562
00:24:39.792 --> 00:24:41.417
-Yeah. baby.
-Did we pay for the rum?

563
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.083
-I paid for the rum.
-What the hell?

564
00:24:43.167 --> 00:24:45.292
Fucking right. and I had to leave a tip.
Goddamn it.

565
00:24:45.375 --> 00:24:46.500
Calm down.

566
00:24:46.583 --> 00:24:48.917
You know what?
When we first met Ron and Kyla.

567
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.708
we thought--
We thought that they were batshit crazy.

568
00:24:51.792 --> 00:24:54.500
-Yeah. we did.
-And you know what? We were wrong.

569
00:24:55.125 --> 00:24:57.458
No. we were--
Baby. we were-- We were right.

570
00:24:57.542 --> 00:24:58.833
Okay. but they're harmless.

571
00:24:58.917 --> 00:25:02.083
And so that's what I'm trying to say.
Maybe Reese is of the same variety.

572
00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:05.583
A-And it's not like
he's gonna be in your meetings with you.

573
00:25:05.667 --> 00:25:07.208
-And that should be the plan.
-Yes.

574
00:25:07.292 --> 00:25:10.125
We need to keep him away from the Koreans.

575
00:25:10.208 --> 00:25:11.333
Okay. I like that plan.

576
00:25:11.417 --> 00:25:13.167
In fact. let's keep him as busy as we can.

577
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.792
And we just pray
that nobody burns down the hotel.

578
00:25:15.875 --> 00:25:18.250
[squeals] Guys! Oh. my God.
There's a bonfire.

579
00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:20.333
-We're all going. Come on.
-[Emily] Bonfire? What?

580
00:25:23.083 --> 00:25:24.125
Wait.

581
00:25:25.625 --> 00:25:27.292
That's not a bonfire.

582
00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:34.167
Question. Um…

583
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.833
Y'all wouldn't happen to know who--

584
00:25:35.917 --> 00:25:38.667
whose lantern it was
that-that caused this. right?

585
00:25:39.292 --> 00:25:40.875
[Yeon sighs] Nope.

586
00:25:40.958 --> 00:25:43.750
We just built this meditation temple too.

587
00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:48.083
Well. this is-- this is gonna have to be
a total rebuild. you know.

588
00:25:48.167 --> 00:25:50.583
From my professional opinion. you know?

589
00:25:50.667 --> 00:25:51.917
[Yeon] Shit!

590
00:25:52.667 --> 00:25:54.292
What the fuck. man?

591
00:25:54.375 --> 00:25:56.833
I told you not to do
the stupid lantern shit.

592
00:25:56.917 --> 00:26:00.333
Once the lanterns are lit.
you can't control the direction.

593
00:26:00.417 --> 00:26:02.625
You're making us look bad
in front of the Americans.

594
00:26:02.708 --> 00:26:06.000
You had to be like. "Yeah. it'd be good
to promote Asian culture.

595
00:26:06.083 --> 00:26:07.667
I used to do this when I was a kid."

596
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:12.708
Do you know how bad it looks for a hotel
group to have a building burn down?

597
00:26:15.958 --> 00:26:17.875
[sighs] Ironic.

598
00:26:17.958 --> 00:26:20.958
The lanterns were supposed to be
a symbol of good luck.

599
00:26:23.667 --> 00:26:27.250
Goddamn. It is heaven
to eat with a metal fork again.

600
00:26:27.333 --> 00:26:31.000
I can't tell you what it's like
to drop a deuce with nobody watching.

601
00:26:31.083 --> 00:26:34.167
-[Ron] Deuce. [chuckles]
-I'm serious. Ron. It's not funny.

602
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:38.000
Do you like shitting
in front of other people? I don't.

603
00:26:38.083 --> 00:26:39.417
[clears throat] Cool. Um…

604
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.417
Well. look. um. what--
What plans do everybody got today?

605
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.083
You know. is it-- You guys plan to do
something that's off the resort?

606
00:26:46.167 --> 00:26:48.250
Why? Why would you wanna leave this place?

607
00:26:48.333 --> 00:26:49.958
I'm never leaving. [chuckles]

608
00:26:50.042 --> 00:26:54.583
I mean. I've never been to the Caribbean
before. but this place is nice.

609
00:26:54.667 --> 00:26:56.542
You know. it's-- It's drug lord nice.

610
00:26:56.625 --> 00:26:58.708
I'm sorry. "Drug lord nice"?

611
00:26:58.792 --> 00:27:03.125
Emily. come on. These places
are like Soho Houses for all the heavies.

612
00:27:03.208 --> 00:27:05.208
The Barnes Brothers. Escobar.

613
00:27:05.292 --> 00:27:09.208
I wouldn't be surprised if Chencho himself
is with us in the hot tub tonight.

614
00:27:10.208 --> 00:27:13.958
-[whispers] Chencho?
-Chencho Novar. From Colombia?

615
00:27:14.042 --> 00:27:16.042
Ah. yes. Chencho Novar.

616
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.125
I watched an entire documentary
about him once.

617
00:27:19.208 --> 00:27:22.042
So deadly. no one who has seen his face
is still alive.

618
00:27:22.125 --> 00:27:25.083
So scary.
nobody will utter his name in public.

619
00:27:26.083 --> 00:27:27.875
Although I-- I guess I just did.

620
00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:31.167
Okay. well. I-- I don't think we have seen
anyone like that around here.

621
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.500
I suppose next they're gonna tell us

622
00:27:32.583 --> 00:27:34.667
that those aren't high-priced hookers
over there.

623
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.542
Definite hookers.
They look extremely expensive though.

624
00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:39.125
And super niche.

625
00:27:39.208 --> 00:27:41.292
If you'll excuse me.
I'm gonna set up camp by the pool

626
00:27:41.375 --> 00:27:43.667
-and check out the merchandise.
-[Kyla] You earned it. Daddy.

627
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:44.958
-Think of something.
-What?

628
00:27:45.042 --> 00:27:46.333
Oh. um. hey!

629
00:27:46.417 --> 00:27:47.458
Um…

630
00:27:47.542 --> 00:27:50.083
Why don't-- Why don't you guys go. um…

631
00:27:51.417 --> 00:27:52.417
go surfing?

632
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.958
-Surfing!
-[Kyla] That is-- Mm-hmm.

633
00:27:54.042 --> 00:27:56.292
Let's go surfing. Let's do some surfing!

634
00:27:57.417 --> 00:27:59.625
Yo. Marcus. What's the room number?

635
00:27:59.708 --> 00:28:01.958
I'm having
another little wedding gift sent here.

636
00:28:02.042 --> 00:28:03.958
You don't have to do that for us.

637
00:28:04.042 --> 00:28:05.042
It's really for her.

638
00:28:05.625 --> 00:28:08.917
Okay. look. Just fill my name on it.
and they'll get it to me. okay?

639
00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:12.583
-Ron. look. thank you for doing this. man.
-Oh. yeah. man.

640
00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:15.417
I was kind of surprised to hear
you know how to surf.

641
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.875
Nah. I don't know how to surf.

642
00:28:16.958 --> 00:28:19.125
I-- I'm not good.
I do some paddleboarding.

643
00:28:19.208 --> 00:28:20.208
Marcus!

644
00:28:20.708 --> 00:28:22.833
-Sometimes you gotta push your limits.
-Okay.

645
00:28:22.917 --> 00:28:24.708
[Ron] Look. I'm just glad to be out here.

646
00:28:24.792 --> 00:28:27.250
It gives Reese and I a chance to bond.
you know?

647
00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:29.083
Reese. I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

648
00:28:29.167 --> 00:28:32.125
I've heard so much about you through
the years and to finally get to know you--

649
00:28:32.208 --> 00:28:34.292
Wait. Are you sure
we're going the right way?

650
00:28:34.375 --> 00:28:36.000
Oh. yeah. I am.

651
00:28:36.083 --> 00:28:38.417
Checked the map at the front desk
before we left.

652
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.792
Old habit I picked up in the service.

653
00:28:41.375 --> 00:28:42.542
Right. I heard.

654
00:28:43.333 --> 00:28:44.500
You're a park ranger.

655
00:28:45.083 --> 00:28:46.500
I am. Uh…

656
00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:49.333
It was-- It was before that. Like the…

657
00:28:50.667 --> 00:28:51.917
service service.

658
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Special Forces.

659
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.333
Yeah.

660
00:28:56.417 --> 00:28:58.125
Ah. I could've done that.

661
00:28:58.208 --> 00:29:01.292
I picked the hard road. pal.
Sales. Now that's war.

662
00:29:01.958 --> 00:29:04.542
What? Look. sales isn't-- It's not war.

663
00:29:04.625 --> 00:29:07.500
He actually fought in the war.
Like combat.

664
00:29:07.583 --> 00:29:08.833
Oh. my bad.

665
00:29:09.708 --> 00:29:12.792
So tell me.
have you ever killed anyone before?

666
00:29:14.167 --> 00:29:17.792
I don't relish in admitting it.
but yes. Reese.

667
00:29:18.333 --> 00:29:20.667
-Yes. I have.
-[chuckles] Okay. Ron. How many?

668
00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.958
[sighs] We don't really talk about it.
It's. uh…

669
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.458
It's kind of a code we all live by.
We just--

670
00:29:26.542 --> 00:29:30.875
Code? And you can't tell us
because it's a secret code.

671
00:29:30.958 --> 00:29:32.958
Look. Reese. that is very disrespectful.

672
00:29:33.042 --> 00:29:35.375
You don't ask a soldier
a question like that.

673
00:29:35.458 --> 00:29:36.625
Forty-two.

674
00:29:38.125 --> 00:29:39.833
Damn. For real?

675
00:29:39.917 --> 00:29:41.250
Forty-two confirmed.

676
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:42.750
A couple of "iffys."

677
00:29:42.833 --> 00:29:45.417
[chuckles] Okay. Rambo.

678
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.792
What are you gonna tell me next?
You deserve a medal for bravery?

679
00:29:49.292 --> 00:29:50.583
Wow.

680
00:29:51.667 --> 00:29:53.708
I have eight of those. actually.

681
00:29:56.458 --> 00:29:59.375
[sighs] What a beautiful day.

682
00:29:59.458 --> 00:30:01.667
I guess. [chuckles]

683
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:02.958
What's wrong with you?

684
00:30:03.042 --> 00:30:06.333
There was a striking young woman
at breakfast getting yogurt.

685
00:30:06.417 --> 00:30:09.458
and all I could think to say to her was.
"Mmm. strawberries."

686
00:30:09.542 --> 00:30:11.083
Mmm. That's not gonna get it done.

687
00:30:11.167 --> 00:30:13.333
It is still very early. okay?

688
00:30:13.417 --> 00:30:16.083
All you gotta do is be yourself. Okay?

689
00:30:16.167 --> 00:30:20.875
And I promise by the end of this week.
you are gonna be a stone-cold killer.

690
00:30:20.958 --> 00:30:23.083
-[Kyla giggles]
-Um. do you want me to be myself.

691
00:30:23.167 --> 00:30:24.625
or do you want me to be a killer?

692
00:30:24.708 --> 00:30:27.292
Because. Emily.
these are two very different things.

693
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.333
[Emily] Oh. this is heaven. [sighs]

694
00:30:30.417 --> 00:30:31.500
Poor girl.

695
00:30:31.583 --> 00:30:34.792
If only she knew how much Ron
and I assed up that chair the other night.

696
00:30:48.833 --> 00:30:50.917
You don't think these waves are too big?

697
00:30:51.708 --> 00:30:52.875
[Ron] I can't tell.

698
00:30:52.958 --> 00:30:56.417
-I mean. those guys are out there.
-[Marcus] Those guys are fucking crazy.

699
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.750
-I'm not going in that shit.
-What? Are you guys scared?

700
00:30:59.833 --> 00:31:00.958
Not at all.

701
00:31:01.042 --> 00:31:03.542
But even in the best conditions.
you have to be careful.

702
00:31:04.125 --> 00:31:06.375
She's a fickle mistress.
You gotta respect her.

703
00:31:07.042 --> 00:31:08.917
You gotta listen to
what she's telling you.

704
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.167
She?

705
00:31:11.167 --> 00:31:12.417
The natural world. Reese.

706
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.667
And if you just be patient.
she'll reveal all the mysteries to you.

707
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.708
It's what I've dedicated my life to.

708
00:31:19.292 --> 00:31:20.292
Like that.

709
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.167
-See that bird there?
-[Reese] Yeah?

710
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.167
I can tell from here.

711
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.417
-That bird's about to shit.
-Hey. Jerome!

712
00:31:27.917 --> 00:31:29.958
Jerome. there you are.

713
00:31:30.583 --> 00:31:31.750
Damn it! I had him.

714
00:31:32.958 --> 00:31:34.333
Hey. tell me if you see another bird.

715
00:31:34.417 --> 00:31:37.458
-Tell me. how we doing this?
-Brother. this thing is a bad idea.

716
00:31:38.208 --> 00:31:40.000
For why you even want to involve Warren?

717
00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:42.875
Because I'm trying go
through the proper channels here.

718
00:31:42.958 --> 00:31:44.917
-[whispers] Oh. man.
-That way we get paid.

719
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.833
and we keep our heads on.

720
00:31:46.917 --> 00:31:48.083
-No. no.
-You don't understand.

721
00:31:48.167 --> 00:31:50.958
I have to get that money.
Look. tell him I have the coordinates.

722
00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:54.333
-[Reese speaking indistinctly]
-[Marcus] How-How does he know this guy?

723
00:31:54.417 --> 00:31:56.958
He said he'd never been
to the Caribbean before.

724
00:31:57.042 --> 00:31:58.750
[panting]

725
00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:00.458
Mr. Parker.

726
00:32:00.542 --> 00:32:01.792
Ron.

727
00:32:01.875 --> 00:32:03.042
[in Korean] Hello.

728
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.625
[in English] What are you two doing
on the backside of the island?

729
00:32:06.708 --> 00:32:08.333
We-- We-- You know something?

730
00:32:08.417 --> 00:32:10.708
We about to get our surf on.
We about to do some surfing.

731
00:32:10.792 --> 00:32:13.500
Ah. I didn't know you surfed.

732
00:32:13.583 --> 00:32:17.208
-That's unusual for someone from Chicago.
-That's not unusual. You know something?

733
00:32:17.292 --> 00:32:19.875
I'm-- I'm a little more
than somebody just from Chicago.

734
00:32:19.958 --> 00:32:20.833
Huh.

735
00:32:20.917 --> 00:32:22.875
Matter fact. it looks intimidating.
but it's not.

736
00:32:22.958 --> 00:32:24.833
You know?
All you gotta do is push your limits.

737
00:32:24.917 --> 00:32:26.250
That's right. Like my friend Ron says.

738
00:32:26.333 --> 00:32:27.667
Right. Ron?

739
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.542
What? Oh. Yes.

740
00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:30.875
That's what-- Yep. yep.

741
00:32:30.958 --> 00:32:33.750
-I like people who push their limits.
-Hell yeah.

742
00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:37.250
All right. Well. uh. we better keep
the pace up before we tighten up.

743
00:32:37.333 --> 00:32:39.417
-Do that. We're gonna do some surfing.
-[in Korean] Let's go!

744
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.750
-[Goe. in English] Okay. Let's go.
-Hey. fools. back to the hotel.

745
00:32:41.833 --> 00:32:43.292
Chop. chop. Let's go.

746
00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.875
Wait. wait. You're going back?

747
00:32:47.708 --> 00:32:50.083
Because you just said
you were gonna jump in.

748
00:32:50.167 --> 00:32:52.292
So. are you surfing
or are you not surfing?

749
00:32:52.375 --> 00:32:55.625
-Yeah. that's--
-[chuckles] Are you kidding me?

750
00:32:55.708 --> 00:32:58.583
These two caked their trunks
the second they saw the waves.

751
00:32:58.667 --> 00:33:01.000
Caked? Me?

752
00:33:01.083 --> 00:33:03.875
What? You're telling me now
that you're not chickening out?

753
00:33:03.958 --> 00:33:06.250
As a matter of fact. Reese.
I'm going for it right now.

754
00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:07.500
Let's do this. Marcus.

755
00:33:10.167 --> 00:33:11.208
[chuckles]

756
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.458
[whispering] Fuck.

757
00:33:14.542 --> 00:33:17.083
[Kyla] Okay. have a good nap. sweetie.

758
00:33:18.458 --> 00:33:22.125
Oh. Isn't he just the most beautiful thing
in the entire world?

759
00:33:22.208 --> 00:33:23.083
[sighs]

760
00:33:25.625 --> 00:33:26.625
You okay?

761
00:33:29.083 --> 00:33:32.042
-I don't wanna have a baby.
-[chuckles] Me neither right now.

762
00:33:32.125 --> 00:33:33.958
No. I mean. like. ever.

763
00:33:34.042 --> 00:33:35.125
Like. of my own.

764
00:33:35.208 --> 00:33:36.708
-Wait. Are you serious?
-Yeah.

765
00:33:36.792 --> 00:33:38.417
I just saw you with baby Marcus.

766
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.125
You were just incredible.

767
00:33:40.208 --> 00:33:41.917
I know! I love kids.

768
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.167
And Marcus and I
have always talked about having them.

769
00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:45.833
but now that the moment is here.

770
00:33:45.917 --> 00:33:49.208
I realized I never actually envisioned
myself carrying these babies.

771
00:33:49.292 --> 00:33:51.958
You've gone through the process.
You know what it does to your body.

772
00:33:52.042 --> 00:33:53.417
-Sweetheart. it's fucking hell.
-[sighs]

773
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.833
I had a stage three tear. which means
I pissed and shit at the same time.

774
00:33:56.917 --> 00:33:59.083
-Oh. my God.
-You're gonna love it.

775
00:33:59.667 --> 00:34:00.792
[sighs]

776
00:34:00.875 --> 00:34:03.292
I just love my life the way it is now.

777
00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:05.083
I know it sounds selfish. I know.

778
00:34:05.167 --> 00:34:08.500
I can hear it. But I feel like
a baby would just ruin all of that.

779
00:34:08.583 --> 00:34:10.833
And I am the happiest
I have ever. ever been.

780
00:34:11.958 --> 00:34:12.958
Does Marcus know?

781
00:34:13.667 --> 00:34:15.667
The man with the ovulation tracker
on his phone?

782
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.250
No. he doesn't know.

783
00:34:17.333 --> 00:34:19.792
I don't want to be a negative Nancy.
but you do have to tell him.

784
00:34:19.875 --> 00:34:23.250
-It would literally break his heart.
-Can I just say something?

785
00:34:23.333 --> 00:34:26.083
I don't know why
I'm not eloquent or smart enough

786
00:34:26.167 --> 00:34:28.458
to be able to say the kind of.
like. badass feminist thing

787
00:34:28.542 --> 00:34:31.333
that I wish I could say now.
but I'm proud of you for knowing yourself.

788
00:34:31.417 --> 00:34:34.542
And secondly. you know.
I think he's gonna understand.

789
00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:37.083
Come on. I mean. do you really think
he's gonna lose his shit?

790
00:34:37.167 --> 00:34:40.417
[screams] Ah! No!

791
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.667
Ron. what the fuck?

792
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.292
Okay. Could be a little tough
paddling out.

793
00:34:44.375 --> 00:34:48.000
[grunts] Man. fuck this!
Okay. why don't we go back? Huh?

794
00:34:48.083 --> 00:34:50.833
We can come up with something.
Say it's a rip current. or something.

795
00:34:50.917 --> 00:34:52.292
Man. you heard Reese.

796
00:34:52.375 --> 00:34:54.917
-I can't chicken out now.
-Who gives a fuck what he thinks?

797
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.417
You kind of cared
what your father-in-law thought. huh?

798
00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.500
I don't know
if you picked up on it back there.

799
00:34:59.583 --> 00:35:03.417
It was kind of subtle. but it just seems
like Reese and I aren't connecting.

800
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.583
I knew it. Chickenshit.

801
00:35:05.667 --> 00:35:08.083
Great. So now
what the fuck am I supposed to do then?

802
00:35:08.167 --> 00:35:10.125
Go back up there alone? And look at--

803
00:35:11.083 --> 00:35:13.542
This motherfucker's filming us. Fuck!

804
00:35:13.625 --> 00:35:16.000
There's only one thing left to do. Marcus.

805
00:35:16.833 --> 00:35:18.167
Surf.

806
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:19.750
Hell no!

807
00:35:19.833 --> 00:35:23.042
-Come on. You did paddleboarding.
-Twice! In a lake!

808
00:35:23.125 --> 00:35:25.125
Look at that set. Marcus.

809
00:35:25.208 --> 00:35:29.000
This may be the only chance in your life
to ride something that fucking perfect.

810
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.792
Once you're out there.
your instincts will kick in.

811
00:35:31.875 --> 00:35:34.292
and then you'll just be one with the wave.

812
00:35:34.958 --> 00:35:37.500
-Are you sure about this?
-Believe in yourself! You can do this!

813
00:35:37.583 --> 00:35:39.792
-I can do this. I can do this.
-You can do this!

814
00:35:39.875 --> 00:35:41.042
-Yes!
-We're going out there.

815
00:35:41.125 --> 00:35:42.917
-and we're going surfing.
-Yes!

816
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.167
Yes!

817
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.292

823
00:36:04.208 --> 00:36:06.917
[gasps. groans. pants]

824
00:36:12.583 --> 00:36:14.625
That was violent.

825
00:36:15.583 --> 00:36:19.292
-Where's Ron? Is Ron okay?
-I'm right here. buddy. I'm totally fine.

826
00:36:19.375 --> 00:36:22.375
[Reese] But you. Marcus.
Fucking hell. man!

827
00:36:22.458 --> 00:36:24.708
I can't believe you're actually alive.

828
00:36:24.792 --> 00:36:28.000
Yeah. I've never seen that much water
come out of a person before.

829
00:36:29.542 --> 00:36:31.750
Did I-- Did I throw up a lot?

830
00:36:31.833 --> 00:36:32.667
[Reese] Mmm.

831
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:34.042
-[Goe] Definitely. no
-Uh. no.

832
00:36:34.625 --> 00:36:36.375
Then where did the water come from?

833
00:36:38.583 --> 00:36:40.042
Your butthole threw up. bud.

834
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:42.750
[groans]

835
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:46.833
Thank you. Ron. You read my mind.

836
00:36:47.583 --> 00:36:48.833
Oh. hey. that's for him.

837
00:36:49.708 --> 00:36:51.167
Baby. I got so much.

838
00:36:51.667 --> 00:36:52.667
-I. um…
-[coos]

839
00:36:53.542 --> 00:36:56.500
-I'm going to need to rinse. Excuse me.
-[Kyla chuckles]

840
00:36:57.667 --> 00:36:59.833
So. how's it going with my dad?

841
00:37:02.167 --> 00:37:04.042
It's going. It's good.

842
00:37:04.125 --> 00:37:07.125
It seems like you guys have. like.
really had a chance to bond.

843
00:37:07.208 --> 00:37:10.958
-Yeah. Yeah. totally bonding. Yeah.
-Oh. thank God!

844
00:37:11.667 --> 00:37:14.542
-I'm so relieved.
-Huh? What?

845
00:37:14.625 --> 00:37:19.292
I don't know if it was. like. my weird
psychic ability kind of flaring up.

846
00:37:19.375 --> 00:37:22.417
but I did have a moment where
I was looking at you. and I was like.

847
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.083
"Oh. my God. I love him so much."

848
00:37:25.167 --> 00:37:27.875
Then I was looking at my dad. and I was.
"Oh. my God. I love him so much."

849
00:37:27.958 --> 00:37:29.875
Then I was looking at you two together
and was like.

850
00:37:29.958 --> 00:37:32.583
"Oh. my God. What if they don't love
each other so much?"

851
00:37:33.292 --> 00:37:34.875
Yeah. A nightmare. right? [laughs]

852
00:37:34.958 --> 00:37:37.542
[laughs] I know! A total nightmare.
It was a total nightmare.

853
00:37:37.625 --> 00:37:41.417
And it got me thinking about Sue's dad
doesn't get along with her husband.

854
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.125
and that's why she got cystic acne

855
00:37:43.208 --> 00:37:44.833
and started collecting
those little glass cats.

856
00:37:44.917 --> 00:37:46.292
And everyone's just worried about her.

857
00:37:46.375 --> 00:37:48.458
I was like.
"I don't want that to happen to me."

858
00:37:48.542 --> 00:37:51.375
But then I'm like.
"I'm just being crazy." because…

859
00:37:52.167 --> 00:37:55.333
you're Ron. and everyone loves you.

860
00:37:55.417 --> 00:37:58.042
Ha! Not literally everyone. you know.

861
00:37:58.125 --> 00:38:01.625
Literally everyone. Every single person.

862
00:38:02.542 --> 00:38:04.375
And that's why I love you.

863
00:38:05.833 --> 00:38:06.917
[Emily] I'm so sorry.

864
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.750
I will never. ever. ever. ever.
ever suggest surfing again.

865
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.625
Good. 'Cause I don't want to even hear
the word surfing. You know what I mean?

866
00:38:15.708 --> 00:38:17.667
Look. I had to do
whatever I had to do to--

867
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:21.250
to get rid of Kyla's fucking
shady-ass father somehow. You know?

868
00:38:21.333 --> 00:38:23.250
Well. you don't have to worry
about him tonight.

869
00:38:23.333 --> 00:38:26.125
Apparently he already got plans.
Some business thing.

870
00:38:26.208 --> 00:38:28.458
Ah. thank God. [groans]

871
00:38:29.083 --> 00:38:32.625
[exhales sharply] Okay. so what. uh--
What you had going on today?

872
00:38:32.708 --> 00:38:33.750
Yeah. it was good.

873
00:38:33.833 --> 00:38:36.167
-You know. we just kicked it by the pool…
-Mmm.

874
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.833
…just talked about stuff.

875
00:38:37.917 --> 00:38:42.375
-Stuff? Like. what type of stuff?
-[smacks lips] Baby. you know.

876
00:38:42.458 --> 00:38:47.333
Girl stuff.
some personal stuff. some deep stuff.

877
00:38:48.625 --> 00:38:51.000
-[cell phone chimes]
-[automated voice] You are ovulating.

878
00:38:51.083 --> 00:38:52.208
[Marcus] Shit! Goddamn it!

879
00:38:52.292 --> 00:38:54.667
Oh. you guys just go at it.
I'll turn the music up.

880
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.083
[cell phone ringing]

881
00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:57.542
[Marcus] What? Hold on.

882
00:38:58.583 --> 00:38:59.583
Hello?

883
00:38:59.667 --> 00:39:01.208
Mr. Parker. it's Yeon.

884
00:39:01.292 --> 00:39:02.833
Hey. man.

885
00:39:02.917 --> 00:39:04.667
Yeon. what's going on. brother?
How you doing?

886
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:09.083
Mrs. Kim wanted me to check
that you are still. well. alive.

887
00:39:09.167 --> 00:39:11.583
-You told her about that today?
- No. no. no.

888
00:39:11.667 --> 00:39:14.458
I sent her the video.
Uh. it made quite the impression.

889
00:39:15.042 --> 00:39:16.958
I wish I could say
she found your effort admirable.

890
00:39:17.042 --> 00:39:19.792
but really she was just concerned
about your well-being.

891
00:39:19.875 --> 00:39:22.125
She said that if you wanted
to cancel your presentation--

892
00:39:22.208 --> 00:39:23.958
Whoa. whoa. whoa. Can-- No. no. no.

893
00:39:24.042 --> 00:39:26.250
We're not using that word here.
We're not canceling anything.

894
00:39:26.333 --> 00:39:29.167
You know. 'cause-- 'cause guess what?
I'm-- Pfft. I am--

895
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.792
-[stomach gurgles]
-I am great. I am so fine.

896
00:39:31.875 --> 00:39:33.292
You're totally fine?

897
00:39:33.375 --> 00:39:35.958
Matter of fact. I was telling my wife
how bad I want to go surfing again.

898
00:39:36.042 --> 00:39:37.333
-What?
- Really?

899
00:39:38.167 --> 00:39:39.583
Well. I wasn't gonna offer this.

900
00:39:39.667 --> 00:39:42.042
but the group and I.
we're going to the casino tonight.

901
00:39:42.125 --> 00:39:44.625
You and your guests
are more than welcome to join. of course.

902
00:39:44.708 --> 00:39:48.292
But. uh. if you can't make it…
[smacks lips] …that's totally fine.

903
00:39:48.375 --> 00:39:50.000
No. no. no. Ain't no buts. [chuckles]

904
00:39:50.083 --> 00:39:53.875
We-- We would love to meet y'all
at the casino tonight.

905
00:39:53.958 --> 00:39:56.375
Okay. Well. I'll see you there then.

906
00:39:56.458 --> 00:39:58.208
-Bye.
-[stomach gurgles]

907
00:39:59.083 --> 00:40:01.250
[groans]
Okay. that was a lot. holding that in.

908
00:40:01.333 --> 00:40:03.708
Uh-uh. You can't go out.
You can't even walk.

909
00:40:03.792 --> 00:40:06.417
-I can walk. Watch. Watch me walk.
-[stomach gurgles]

910
00:40:07.083 --> 00:40:09.750
-See? I'm walking to the bathroom.
-Oh! Oh. baby.

911
00:40:15.042 --> 00:40:17.708
-[slot machines pinging]
-[patrons talking indistinctly]

912
00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.167
-[whispers] Wow!
-Okay. I'm just gonna say it.

913
00:40:23.667 --> 00:40:24.958
This place is nicer than Reno.

914
00:40:25.042 --> 00:40:27.833
Okay. And look. guys.
I want all of us to have fun tonight.

915
00:40:27.917 --> 00:40:29.333
but the Kim Wae people are here.

916
00:40:29.417 --> 00:40:31.167
and I want to make
a good impression. Okay?

917
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.708
Got you.
You want us to get super fucked up.

918
00:40:33.792 --> 00:40:36.708
Let's score some Molly. and maybe
we could pitch Yeon on a hot three-way.

919
00:40:36.792 --> 00:40:38.500
-No. no. no. no. Hell no.
-No.

920
00:40:38.583 --> 00:40:41.208
I'm kidding. I'm not drinking tonight.
We've got our child here.

921
00:40:41.292 --> 00:40:42.625
Come on. We're not monsters.

922
00:40:42.708 --> 00:40:44.917
[laughs]
How's that fucking ass tonight. buddy?

923
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.583
You ready to get spanked?

924
00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:47.833
Four hundred for us.

925
00:40:47.917 --> 00:40:49.583
Let me go find Yeon. I'll be back.

926
00:40:49.667 --> 00:40:51.167
Come on. Em. You wanna play? Come on.

927
00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:54.625
Actually. I don't really see
the appeal of gambling.

928
00:40:54.708 --> 00:40:58.583
What? Come. Let mama show you.
You just have to know how to play.

929
00:40:59.083 --> 00:41:01.875
Sir. you can't have a baby at the table.

930
00:41:04.208 --> 00:41:05.792
-[groans]
-[stomach gurgles]

931
00:41:05.875 --> 00:41:07.125
[Yeon] Good.

932
00:41:07.208 --> 00:41:08.958
Hey! Hey. Marcus!

933
00:41:09.792 --> 00:41:12.250
-Marcus!
-Yeon.

934
00:41:12.333 --> 00:41:14.375
-Hey. come over here.
-[in Korean] Come here. come here.

935
00:41:14.458 --> 00:41:16.625
-[Yeon. in English] Yeah. yeah! Sit. sit.
-[in Korean] Go. go.

936
00:41:16.708 --> 00:41:18.958
[in English] How you doing?
What's going on?

937
00:41:19.042 --> 00:41:21.375
-Sit. sit. Marcus.
-[Goe. in Korean] Sit down. Sit down.

938
00:41:21.458 --> 00:41:23.333
-[in English] What's going on?
-Come play with us.

939
00:41:23.417 --> 00:41:26.917
-Play what?
-[in Korean] A drinking game. Mr. Parker.

940
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.250
[mutters]

941
00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:30.917
[in English]
What we call after-work drinks.

942
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.750
This is how we bond in our business.

943
00:41:32.833 --> 00:41:35.667
-It's a company tradition. [chuckles]
-[Goe chuckles]

944
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.250
-Huh.
-[Goe. in Korean] Get ready.

945
00:41:39.833 --> 00:41:41.333
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

946
00:41:48.458 --> 00:41:51.708
-Ah! [laughs]
-[in English] I win again! You all suck!

947
00:41:51.792 --> 00:41:52.958
You all suck!

948
00:41:53.042 --> 00:41:55.667
[all laughing]

949
00:42:00.375 --> 00:42:02.000
[laughter ends]

950
00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:05.583
[Marcus continues laughing] He was-- He--

951
00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:08.167
[Yeon clears throat]

952
00:42:10.875 --> 00:42:11.875
Oh.

953
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.958
These were for me?

954
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.500
No. I'm not drinking tonight. man.

955
00:42:18.583 --> 00:42:20.875
I'm taking a break.
I'm on a-- I'm on a drink fast.

956
00:42:21.917 --> 00:42:23.083
Excuse me?

957
00:42:23.167 --> 00:42:26.000
Okay. look.
I'm not trying to offend any of y'all.

958
00:42:26.083 --> 00:42:29.750
Especially you. Yeon.
But I-- I cannot do this tonight.

959
00:42:29.833 --> 00:42:31.500
This is how we bond.

960
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.375
Are you saying
you don't want to bond with us?

961
00:42:35.458 --> 00:42:37.958
No! Come on now. I just can't drink. okay?

962
00:42:38.042 --> 00:42:40.875
I said it's a company tradition.

963
00:42:41.458 --> 00:42:43.292
Somebody has to play.

964
00:42:45.458 --> 00:42:47.208
Twenty again? Shit!

965
00:42:47.292 --> 00:42:51.542
Ron. Ron! Wait. Why you and the baby--
Look. no. fuck that-- I need you to drink.

966
00:42:51.625 --> 00:42:53.417
[chuckles]
Marcus. you told me specifically--

967
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.958
I know what I said. damn it!
Come with me. Come now.

968
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.500
Mmm. So. babe. oh. my God. It looked like
Marcus took your talk really well.

969
00:43:01.583 --> 00:43:03.667
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

970
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.250
Because we didn't have it.

971
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.208
I just wanna make sure
I'm assessing this correctly.

972
00:43:08.292 --> 00:43:11.917
-This is a-- This is a drinking game?
-Yes. I need you to pinch hit for me.

973
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.500
No. Marcus. If I do something like this.
I'm gonna have to unleash the beast.

974
00:43:15.583 --> 00:43:17.750
Are you comfortable with that? Yes or no?

975
00:43:17.833 --> 00:43:19.042
In this case…

976
00:43:21.083 --> 00:43:22.083
yes.

977
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
All right. you fucking pussies.

978
00:43:29.042 --> 00:43:33.500
-Let's do this.
-No. It's you who's the pussy.

979
00:43:35.333 --> 00:43:37.875
[in Korean] Hey. okay. get ready!

980
00:43:37.958 --> 00:43:39.083
All right.

981
00:43:44.958 --> 00:43:46.208
Cheers!

982
00:43:51.708 --> 00:43:54.167
[shouts. speaks in English] Suck it!

983
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:57.875
Fuck yeah! [laughs]

984
00:44:00.208 --> 00:44:02.000
[in Korean]

985
00:44:10.167 --> 00:44:12.000
[in English] Get Minjin.

986
00:44:13.458 --> 00:44:16.792
I saw it in his eyes. I know
how much he wants this baby. and I just--

987
00:44:16.875 --> 00:44:18.792
I couldn't do it to him.
I couldn't break his heart.

988
00:44:18.875 --> 00:44:22.042
-[dealer] Nineteen. Dealer wins.
-You're on fucking notice. dude.

989
00:44:22.958 --> 00:44:25.833
But I mean. it's also so confusing.

990
00:44:25.917 --> 00:44:30.250
So. I think that this is
just one of those moments in life

991
00:44:30.333 --> 00:44:33.042
-where you have to listen to that wisdom…
-[sighs] Mmm.

992
00:44:33.125 --> 00:44:35.875
…that is deep within your soul that says.

993
00:44:35.958 --> 00:44:38.583
-"You cocksucker."
-I'm sorry. What?

994
00:44:38.667 --> 00:44:39.750
You cocksucker!

995
00:44:39.833 --> 00:44:41.833
I see exactly what it is
that you're doing.

996
00:44:41.917 --> 00:44:43.417
Excuse me. ma'am?

997
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.208
You're not showing us your cards
until after we find out what ours are.

998
00:44:46.292 --> 00:44:48.917
-You know what? You gotta go first.
-Ma'am. ma'am. don't--

999
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.167
-[Kyla] Just go first.
-Don't touch the cards.

1000
00:44:52.083 --> 00:44:55.250
-Great. You just burned the deck.
-Hey. sorry.

1001
00:44:55.333 --> 00:44:58.333
[clears throat]
I thought you said you knew how to play.

1002
00:44:58.417 --> 00:45:00.458
I do know how to play.
All the face cards were out.

1003
00:45:00.542 --> 00:45:03.208
The shoe was absolutely fucked.
and I had to do something.

1004
00:45:03.292 --> 00:45:05.750
My tits are on fire. I gotta go pump.

1005
00:45:05.833 --> 00:45:06.667
I'll be right back.

1006
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:11.250
Okay. so whenever the low cards come out.
that's when you go deep. Trust me.

1007
00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:13.750
Uh-huh.

1008
00:45:13.833 --> 00:45:16.250
[crowd cheering]

1009
00:45:16.583 --> 00:45:20.917
[Yeon. in Korean]

1010
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.958
-[in English] Okay. we end this right now.
-Fuck that. dude. I got this!

1011
00:45:24.042 --> 00:45:26.625
Listen to me. damn it!
Alcohol poisoning is fucking dangerous.

1012
00:45:26.708 --> 00:45:29.292
-You get what I'm saying?
-Dude. I fucking got this.

1013
00:45:29.375 --> 00:45:31.083
[crowd cheering]

1014
00:45:31.167 --> 00:45:33.333
[in Korean] Quiet. quiet! Be quiet!
Calm down!

1015
00:45:34.833 --> 00:45:37.208
Hey. Let's get ready.

1016
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:39.417
One.

1017
00:45:40.375 --> 00:45:41.708
Two.

1018
00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:43.250
Three.

1019
00:45:45.167 --> 00:45:46.667
-One shot!
-[crowd cheering]

1020
00:46:12.542 --> 00:46:13.750
[grunting]

1021
00:46:15.292 --> 00:46:16.833
[person cheers. claps]

1022
00:46:16.917 --> 00:46:18.083
[cheering stops]

1023
00:46:22.958 --> 00:46:24.708
[in English] Um…

1024
00:46:25.208 --> 00:46:26.792
[paramedic] Fifty-five year old male…

1025
00:46:26.875 --> 00:46:28.958
-[paramedic 2] Sir. sir! Can you hear me?
- …No response.

1026
00:46:29.042 --> 00:46:31.167
[paramedic 3] There we go.
Sir. do you know where you are?

1027
00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:32.625
He's breathing.

1028
00:46:32.708 --> 00:46:33.708
He's breathing.

1029
00:46:33.792 --> 00:46:35.667
[Yeon sighs] Thank God.

1030
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:38.333
Oh! Hi. my sweet little baby boo!

1031
00:46:38.958 --> 00:46:40.625
Well played. Mr. Parker.

1032
00:46:41.208 --> 00:46:42.625
Well played.

1033
00:46:42.708 --> 00:46:44.000
[Marcus] Thank you. [chuckles]

1034
00:46:44.083 --> 00:46:46.375
Uh. I need to find a bathroom.
I'll be back.

1035
00:46:46.458 --> 00:46:47.958
[Ron] Me too.

1036
00:46:49.417 --> 00:46:51.208
Okay. here's the way I look at it.

1037
00:46:51.833 --> 00:46:56.583
I've got something you want.
and I really wanna fucking give it to you.

1038
00:46:56.667 --> 00:46:59.875
So we just need to come up
with some kind of agreement.

1039
00:46:59.958 --> 00:47:02.792
I told you. Ten grand.

1040
00:47:02.875 --> 00:47:06.917
Actually. Warren.
I was thinking more like half.

1041
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.125
Half? Half of what?

1042
00:47:09.208 --> 00:47:11.292
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles]

1043
00:47:11.375 --> 00:47:12.958
Of whatever you've got on that plane.

1044
00:47:15.667 --> 00:47:18.042
Yeah. That was a close call.

1045
00:47:18.125 --> 00:47:21.375
I didn't exactly make it.
but thank God there were so many sinks.

1046
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:23.917
[Marcus] Reese?

1047
00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.250
Holy shit. that is Reese.

1048
00:47:29.125 --> 00:47:31.250
I don't know
what Jerome told you about me--

1049
00:47:31.333 --> 00:47:33.000
-Jerome not work for me.
-[Reese] Okay. look.

1050
00:47:33.083 --> 00:47:34.750
I know where your plane went down.

1051
00:47:35.333 --> 00:47:36.667
Yeah. the location's a little hot.

1052
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:39.042
but I could take you there tomorrow
if you want.

1053
00:47:39.125 --> 00:47:40.542
You can do that.

1054
00:47:41.042 --> 00:47:43.250
Or you can just give me
the coordinates now.

1055
00:47:43.333 --> 00:47:44.875
And give up all my leverage.

1056
00:47:44.958 --> 00:47:46.667
Why the fuck would I do that?

1057
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:49.125
So I don't blow your damn brains out.

1058
00:47:49.792 --> 00:47:51.958
What you gonna do?
Shoot me in the middle of the dance floor?

1059
00:47:52.042 --> 00:47:53.375
Of course not.

1060
00:47:53.458 --> 00:47:56.250
Take him outside and then shoot him.

1061
00:47:58.458 --> 00:48:00.542
Come on. Let's take a walk.

1062
00:48:02.208 --> 00:48:04.542
Reese! Reese!

1063
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:09.208
Tell your ding-dongs
to put their guns away. all right?

1064
00:48:09.292 --> 00:48:11.500
You see this guy
coming over here right now?

1065
00:48:11.583 --> 00:48:14.500
The one who looks like
he just had diarrhea?

1066
00:48:14.583 --> 00:48:16.167
Mmm. No. not him. The one next to him.

1067
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:18.542
The big guy.
the scary-looking motherfucker.

1068
00:48:18.625 --> 00:48:20.500
-He's with me.
-[Ron] Reese.

1069
00:48:20.583 --> 00:48:22.000
-[chuckling] Hey. you two.
-Reese.

1070
00:48:22.083 --> 00:48:24.000
Oh. Ron. am I glad to see you.

1071
00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:26.208
Yeah. me too. Reese. We gotta talk.

1072
00:48:26.708 --> 00:48:28.208
It's something important.

1073
00:48:30.625 --> 00:48:31.625
Okay.

1074
00:48:32.958 --> 00:48:36.042
[sniffles] Why don't you like me?

1075
00:48:36.125 --> 00:48:37.875
[crying] I don't get it.

1076
00:48:39.708 --> 00:48:41.583
[crying continues]

1077
00:48:44.958 --> 00:48:46.958
-[Reese] Ron. Ron.
-[Ron speaks indistinctly]

1078
00:48:47.042 --> 00:48:50.625
-Hey. um… [chuckles] …I'm-- I'm Marcus.
-[sniffles]

1079
00:48:50.708 --> 00:48:54.292
Okay. come on. baby. Paint that ace!
Okay. come on! Let's paint that ace.

1080
00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:56.750
-Paint that ace with a ten!
-Blackjack again.

1081
00:48:56.833 --> 00:49:00.250
-Y'all see that? That's me all day.
-[floor boss] Excuse me. ma'am.

1082
00:49:00.333 --> 00:49:03.000
-[Emily] Hey.
-I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1083
00:49:03.083 --> 00:49:04.333
Why?

1084
00:49:04.417 --> 00:49:08.417
You are aware that in this casino
counting cards is strictly forbidden?

1085
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.125
Oh! Well. I'm not counting cards.

1086
00:49:10.208 --> 00:49:11.625
See-- Let me tell you how to play.

1087
00:49:11.708 --> 00:49:15.250
You just gotta keep track
of the face cards and the low cards. Boom.

1088
00:49:15.333 --> 00:49:17.083
That is counting cards.

1089
00:49:18.583 --> 00:49:19.583
It is?

1090
00:49:19.667 --> 00:49:20.625
[sniffling]

1091
00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:22.917
Get it together. man. What's the matter?

1092
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.625
[stammers] For the first time ever.

1093
00:49:24.708 --> 00:49:27.000
I'm having to deal with
all these emotions.

1094
00:49:27.083 --> 00:49:29.625
You know. uh. disappointment. insecurity…

1095
00:49:29.708 --> 00:49:31.875
-Okay. now is not the time to--
-…inadequacy.

1096
00:49:31.958 --> 00:49:35.458
How about anger? Huh?
You feeling some anger now? Fury?

1097
00:49:35.542 --> 00:49:38.958
No. It's. uh--
It's like a pain and a sadness.

1098
00:49:39.042 --> 00:49:41.667
I just wish you knew
I would do anything for you. Reese.

1099
00:49:42.458 --> 00:49:44.708
-Anything?
-You name it. You name it.

1100
00:49:44.792 --> 00:49:49.083
Okay. well. why don't you tell Warren here
how many people you've killed?

1101
00:49:51.625 --> 00:49:52.625
Oh. I…

1102
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.208
Warren. hey. I am Ron.

1103
00:49:58.292 --> 00:49:59.792
Yeah. nice to meet you guys.

1104
00:49:59.875 --> 00:50:01.250
I can't do that because of the code.

1105
00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:02.583
-We talked about it. I--
-Ron!

1106
00:50:02.667 --> 00:50:04.542
Okay. 42 people. Forty-two.

1107
00:50:06.875 --> 00:50:09.542
All legitimate targets though.
Hmm. Every one of them.

1108
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.458
[whispers] Hey. um…

1109
00:50:15.833 --> 00:50:17.833
I think
we should get the fuck out of here.

1110
00:50:17.917 --> 00:50:20.542
Um… I don't think
you're reading the room correctly.

1111
00:50:20.625 --> 00:50:24.292
-[chuckles] We gonna get up out of here.
-That would be best.

1112
00:50:24.375 --> 00:50:27.667
No. wait. A few iffys. You guys--
They wanna hear about the iffys?

1113
00:50:29.292 --> 00:50:31.208
What can I say. Warren? I tried.

1114
00:50:34.417 --> 00:50:35.792
Reese. what was that all about?

1115
00:50:36.292 --> 00:50:37.333
[Reese] What was what about?

1116
00:50:37.417 --> 00:50:39.292
You know what. The shit with those dudes.

1117
00:50:39.375 --> 00:50:40.375
Who?

1118
00:50:40.458 --> 00:50:43.542
Oh. those guys. Yeah. no. they're--
They're just new friends of mine.

1119
00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:47.125
New friends who were very impressed
with you. Ron.

1120
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
As was I.

1121
00:50:49.833 --> 00:50:51.667
-Really?
-[chuckling] Yeah. hey.

1122
00:50:52.208 --> 00:50:54.958
Salaam and all that. Thanks again.

1123
00:50:55.042 --> 00:50:56.250
I'll catch you guys later.

1124
00:50:58.083 --> 00:51:00.583
Look. Ron. I know that's
your father-in-law and everything.

1125
00:51:00.667 --> 00:51:02.875
but that guy is up to something.
I'm telling you.

1126
00:51:02.958 --> 00:51:03.958
Reese?

1127
00:51:04.792 --> 00:51:05.792
Come on.

1128
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.042
You were right. He didn't bite. [sighs]

1129
00:51:08.125 --> 00:51:09.792
In fact. he was being a dick about it.

1130
00:51:10.292 --> 00:51:12.000
Look. it's time to move to plan B.

1131
00:51:13.208 --> 00:51:17.083
Yes. Jerome. I have a plan B.
Tell me you know how to scuba dive.

1132
00:51:17.667 --> 00:51:18.875
Reese is a great dude.

1133
00:51:18.958 --> 00:51:21.042
Look at me. no the fuck he's not.

1134
00:51:21.125 --> 00:51:22.333
He's not even an okay dude.

1135
00:51:22.417 --> 00:51:24.000
Did you just not see that?

1136
00:51:25.167 --> 00:51:26.292
We connected. man.

1137
00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:28.875
I think this might've been.
like. a real breakthrough.

1138
00:51:28.958 --> 00:51:31.458
You know what? I may even
look into that crypto thing he's got.

1139
00:51:31.542 --> 00:51:33.792
-What? You don't need to be participa--
-[Emily] Let me go!

1140
00:51:33.875 --> 00:51:35.000
But I wasn't even cheating!

1141
00:51:35.083 --> 00:51:36.833
-Wait. where's my money?
-Is that Emily?

1142
00:51:36.917 --> 00:51:39.667
Where is my money?
I'm from Chicago. Let me down!

1143
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:42.042
Shit. Get your hands off my fucking wife!

1144
00:51:45.833 --> 00:51:49.208
[Yeon] Again. thank you so much
for doing this.

1145
00:51:49.292 --> 00:51:51.917
[Marcus] Ah. it's okay. It's okay.
We're-- We're almost to your room.

1146
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.458
[inhales sharply]
You wanna know something. Marcus?

1147
00:51:54.542 --> 00:51:56.625
[laughs] I'm starting to like you.

1148
00:51:57.125 --> 00:52:00.125
Okay. that's cool and everything. man.
And-And Yeon. look. I-I like you too.

1149
00:52:00.208 --> 00:52:02.583
No. I'm not just drunk. I mean it.

1150
00:52:03.208 --> 00:52:05.208
You're a fighter. like me.

1151
00:52:05.292 --> 00:52:06.708
You think on your feet.

1152
00:52:07.875 --> 00:52:09.625
Plus. you have great friends.

1153
00:52:10.375 --> 00:52:11.500
Fucking love you. man.

1154
00:52:12.292 --> 00:52:14.250
-[Ron] Oh!
-[Yeon] And in my opinion…

1155
00:52:14.333 --> 00:52:16.083
-[Ron grunts] Okay.
-[breathes heavily]

1156
00:52:16.167 --> 00:52:17.375
…you should get this job.

1157
00:52:17.875 --> 00:52:19.333
Seriously?

1158
00:52:20.042 --> 00:52:21.208
It's my honest opinion.

1159
00:52:21.292 --> 00:52:23.125
[chuckles] That's great. man.

1160
00:52:23.708 --> 00:52:26.167
Too bad my opinion doesn't matter.

1161
00:52:27.583 --> 00:52:29.875
Wait. what? What are you
talking about? You're the VP.

1162
00:52:29.958 --> 00:52:32.375
-You're in charge of this whole project.
-So what?

1163
00:52:32.917 --> 00:52:34.542
She doesn't listen to me.

1164
00:52:34.625 --> 00:52:38.125
Mrs. Kim doesn't care one bit
about my opinion.

1165
00:52:38.208 --> 00:52:39.333
That's fucked up.

1166
00:52:39.417 --> 00:52:41.042
-Ron. come on now.
-Sorry.

1167
00:52:41.125 --> 00:52:42.833
No. No. he's right.

1168
00:52:43.458 --> 00:52:44.917
That is fucked up.

1169
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
[scoffs] You wanna hear my opinion?

1170
00:52:48.167 --> 00:52:50.792
-You wanna hear my opinion. Mrs. Kim? Kim.
-Okay. okay.

1171
00:52:50.875 --> 00:52:56.000
My opinion is that you are a mean person.

1172
00:52:57.458 --> 00:52:59.292
-Yeon. you know she's not--
-I'm gonna tell her that.

1173
00:52:59.375 --> 00:53:02.167
Next time I talk to her. I don't even
care anymore. I'm just gonna say it.

1174
00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:03.667
I'm gonna say it to her face.

1175
00:53:04.167 --> 00:53:07.167
-That's right. I'm gonna say--
-[cell phone buzzing]

1176
00:53:11.958 --> 00:53:12.958
[clears throat]

1177
00:53:13.667 --> 00:53:14.667
Mrs. Kim.

1178
00:53:15.375 --> 00:53:16.375
Yes.

1179
00:53:17.167 --> 00:53:18.208
[in Korean] Yes.

1180
00:53:18.292 --> 00:53:20.458
[in English]
No. no. no. no. no. No. That--

1181
00:53:20.542 --> 00:53:21.583
That won't be a problem.

1182
00:53:21.667 --> 00:53:23.875
No. no. of course. Of course. Thank you.

1183
00:53:23.958 --> 00:53:24.958
I'm sorry.

1184
00:53:25.792 --> 00:53:27.083
Thank you. Sorry.

1185
00:53:28.125 --> 00:53:29.125
[cell phone clicks]

1186
00:53:29.625 --> 00:53:33.167
Uh. Mrs. Kim just spoke to her architects.

1187
00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:37.000
And. uh. she would like the roof
to be slate now.

1188
00:53:37.917 --> 00:53:41.917
[chuckles] She want the roof to--
to be slate?

1189
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.167
Is that gonna be a problem?

1190
00:53:43.917 --> 00:53:45.375
Pfft. What?

1191
00:53:45.458 --> 00:53:48.083
Shit. man! Look.
we've never worked with slate before.

1192
00:53:48.167 --> 00:53:49.708
So what? We'll figure it out.

1193
00:53:49.792 --> 00:53:52.750
What you mean. "So what"?
Look. this isn't thermo PVC. okay?

1194
00:53:52.833 --> 00:53:54.625
And you gotta take into account
all breakages

1195
00:53:54.708 --> 00:53:57.500
and fucking finding. uh-- uh.
bonding agents. all that shit.

1196
00:53:57.583 --> 00:54:00.375
Come on. man. You gotta relax.
everything's gonna be fine.

1197
00:54:00.458 --> 00:54:02.083
What the hell do you mean.
"It'll be fine"?

1198
00:54:02.167 --> 00:54:05.125
I don't want it to just be fine.
I want it to be perfect.

1199
00:54:05.208 --> 00:54:08.333
If you try to get it perfect.
you're just gonna fuck it up. playboy.

1200
00:54:08.417 --> 00:54:09.417
Exactly why I never try.

1201
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:12.417
Shut the fuck up.
Both of y'all. just-just shut up.

1202
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:13.750
Do me a favor. okay?

1203
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:17.708
Work out a new budget. add the slate
in there. and give it to me tonight.

1204
00:54:17.792 --> 00:54:19.083
Whoa. Tonight?

1205
00:54:19.167 --> 00:54:22.625
Yes. Tonight. Okay. I wanna read
all of it. No surprises. okay?

1206
00:54:22.708 --> 00:54:24.625
-Marcus Parker?
-[Fred] Okay.

1207
00:54:24.708 --> 00:54:25.875
Just so you know.

1208
00:54:25.958 --> 00:54:28.833
when you get the handouts tomorrow.
skip over the last part.

1209
00:54:28.917 --> 00:54:29.958
That's all fucked up now.

1210
00:54:30.042 --> 00:54:31.875
What are you talking about?
I got it in my hand here.

1211
00:54:31.958 --> 00:54:34.708
Oh. no. you don't. We're tracking
right here. it says it's still in Miami.

1212
00:54:34.792 --> 00:54:35.792
What's this then?

1213
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:40.958
What the fuck.

1214
00:54:41.042 --> 00:54:42.042
[Fred] Boss?

1215
00:54:42.625 --> 00:54:44.208
-Cocaine.
-Hey.

1216
00:54:44.292 --> 00:54:46.125
-Oh!
-Glad I caught you.

1217
00:54:46.208 --> 00:54:48.667
Cau-Caught me doing-- What'd you say?

1218
00:54:50.667 --> 00:54:55.292
Listen. I just wanted to thank you
for getting me home last night.

1219
00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:57.500
Oh.

1220
00:54:58.958 --> 00:55:01.667
Last night. Man. come on.
That-That was nothing.

1221
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:04.250
-No-No big deal at all.
-No. no. no. It is a big deal.

1222
00:55:04.958 --> 00:55:07.375
[stammers]
I shared some thoughts that were…

1223
00:55:08.583 --> 00:55:09.500
out of line.

1224
00:55:09.583 --> 00:55:11.375
Thoughts about my superior.

1225
00:55:12.708 --> 00:55:14.708
Dude. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1226
00:55:14.792 --> 00:55:16.875
I don't even remember
none of that shit. but--

1227
00:55:16.958 --> 00:55:20.167
No. no. no.
It was totally unprofessional and. uh…

1228
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:23.417
In fact. I don't even know
why I said that.

1229
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.667
I don't know where it came from.
I didn't mean it.

1230
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:29.792
Look. man. I-I'm not no snitch. okay?
I ain't gonna tell on you. You good.

1231
00:55:30.667 --> 00:55:31.792
-Really?
-Yeah.

1232
00:55:31.875 --> 00:55:34.125
Great. because the last thing
I would ever want to do

1233
00:55:34.208 --> 00:55:36.667
is put you in an embarrassing situation
where you had--

1234
00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:41.250
Oh. I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm. like. totally crushing your package.

1235
00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:43.333
You ain't crushing my package.
'cause that's not mine.

1236
00:55:43.417 --> 00:55:46.708
-Whatever you're crushing. no. it's not--
-Sorry. man. Gotta re-scan that.

1237
00:55:47.292 --> 00:55:49.167
-Re-scan what?
-Uh. your express pack.

1238
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:50.750
You know. the one you just signed for?

1239
00:55:50.833 --> 00:55:52.375
-Oh. This?
-There it is.

1240
00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.542
Oh. [chuckles]

1241
00:55:55.625 --> 00:55:57.167
You know something. I forgot--

1242
00:55:57.250 --> 00:56:00.250
'Cause I had to sign for this earlier
for somebody else. 'Cause this not mine.

1243
00:56:00.333 --> 00:56:02.583
-Know what I mean?
-Wait. Are you not Marcus Parker?

1244
00:56:02.667 --> 00:56:03.833
No. No. he is.

1245
00:56:03.917 --> 00:56:06.542
I thought so. Well. all yours.

1246
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Thank you.

1247
00:56:09.917 --> 00:56:11.167
[whispering] Motherfucker.

1248
00:56:13.833 --> 00:56:15.250
Is-- Is everything okay?

1249
00:56:15.333 --> 00:56:16.417
Mm-hmm.

1250
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.833
Cocaine!

1251
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:20.875
Your father sent me cocaine.

1252
00:56:20.958 --> 00:56:24.417
Wow! This is way more than you've
ever smuggled in your ass. babe.

1253
00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:26.708
-It's a lot of cocaine.
-There's like five pounds in there.

1254
00:56:26.792 --> 00:56:27.792
-What?
-[Maurillio] Marcus.

1255
00:56:27.875 --> 00:56:30.167
why did you sign
for five pounds of cocaine?

1256
00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:32.167
Yeah. baby. Why did you do that?

1257
00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:33.958
I didn't know it was cocaine
in the package.

1258
00:56:34.042 --> 00:56:36.250
When you sign for something.
they don't tell you what's in there.

1259
00:56:36.333 --> 00:56:40.000
Oh. God! That's like major trafficking.
Like-like international--

1260
00:56:40.083 --> 00:56:41.250
[snorts]

1261
00:56:42.292 --> 00:56:43.292
Hey!

1262
00:56:43.875 --> 00:56:45.625
What the fuck are you do--

1263
00:56:45.708 --> 00:56:47.958
I didn't bring this to you to snort it.

1264
00:56:48.042 --> 00:56:50.583
It is cocaine. Marcus. What are we--
Are we not supposed to do it?

1265
00:56:50.667 --> 00:56:52.417
No. motherfucker! No!

1266
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:53.792
-[snorts]
-What the fuck are--

1267
00:56:53.875 --> 00:56:57.042
You just heard me say some shit to him.
Get rid of this shit right the fuck now.

1268
00:56:57.125 --> 00:56:58.292
We got rid of a little bit.

1269
00:56:58.375 --> 00:57:01.958
Yeah. And I think if we just keep plugging
away. it'll be gone before we know it.

1270
00:57:02.042 --> 00:57:04.167
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?

1271
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:08.958
Oh. great! Come on. Marcus.
Now Kyla knows?

1272
00:57:09.042 --> 00:57:11.417
It was supposed to be a surprise. What--

1273
00:57:12.333 --> 00:57:13.750
Oh. [laughs]

1274
00:57:14.333 --> 00:57:17.708
I'm sorry. Reese.
Did I-- Did I ruin your surprise?

1275
00:57:18.208 --> 00:57:19.500
Wow!

1276
00:57:19.583 --> 00:57:21.708
You wanna know who else was surprised?
Come here.

1277
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.542
Me. motherfucker!

1278
00:57:23.625 --> 00:57:24.958
I was surprised to get a package.

1279
00:57:25.042 --> 00:57:26.875
and I almost opened that shit
in front of Yeon!

1280
00:57:26.958 --> 00:57:28.667
First off. you told me
to put it in your name.

1281
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:30.125
I know what I said. Shut the fuck up.

1282
00:57:30.208 --> 00:57:32.583
-Okay?
-What? What? Marcus. Marcus!

1283
00:57:32.667 --> 00:57:34.958
Baby. I am sorry. but I was fucking right!

1284
00:57:35.042 --> 00:57:37.375
He almost blew the job for me.
and I want him out of here.

1285
00:57:37.458 --> 00:57:40.583
Matter of fact.
this guy right here is a criminal.

1286
00:57:40.667 --> 00:57:43.500
If you went to jail.
you must have really did some shit.

1287
00:57:43.583 --> 00:57:46.875
And. man. don't you give me that
"innocent victim of the system" bullshit.

1288
00:57:46.958 --> 00:57:50.167
-I am an innocent victim of the system--
-I am an innocent-- Shut the fuck up!

1289
00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:52.708
Just admit it.
you were using me to smuggle drugs.

1290
00:57:52.792 --> 00:57:55.125
Marcus. that's not drugs.

1291
00:57:55.208 --> 00:57:56.917
Kiss my ass. okay?

1292
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.125
If it's not drugs.
then. Reese. what the fuck is it?

1293
00:58:00.208 --> 00:58:02.000
Why does this coke not taste coke-y?

1294
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.042
Because it's your mom.

1295
00:58:07.292 --> 00:58:08.542
Oh. my God!

1296
00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:10.583
That's her?

1297
00:58:10.667 --> 00:58:13.542
-Oh. no. no. no. no. no. no. no!
-Yes. Emily.

1298
00:58:13.625 --> 00:58:16.000
Those are her mom's ashes.

1299
00:58:16.083 --> 00:58:17.375
[Kyla] Oh. Mom!

1300
00:58:17.458 --> 00:58:19.208
She died while he was in jail.

1301
00:58:19.292 --> 00:58:21.625
and we didn't get a chance
to spread her ashes around.

1302
00:58:21.708 --> 00:58:24.333
Again. hated her. a witch.

1303
00:58:24.833 --> 00:58:27.833
But I had them sent here
so we could scatter them together.

1304
00:58:28.417 --> 00:58:29.625
I just snorted your mom?

1305
00:58:30.125 --> 00:58:31.125
I just did too.

1306
00:58:32.417 --> 00:58:34.583
It's really kind of beautiful
if you think about it.

1307
00:58:34.667 --> 00:58:39.292
Well. I realize now I should've
reminded you about it. but fuck. Marcus.

1308
00:58:39.792 --> 00:58:43.167
I had no idea you'd rip it open
and start chopping her up into lines.

1309
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:44.833
-Hey. hey. Look. man.
-I mean--

1310
00:58:44.917 --> 00:58:48.667
Now you can-- I did some fucked--
I said some mean--

1311
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:51.458
I said some really mean things.
but I'ma tell you what I didn't do.

1312
00:58:51.542 --> 00:58:54.375
I did not chop those white-woman ashes up.

1313
00:58:54.458 --> 00:58:56.750
-That is what they did. I did not do that.
-Look-- [scoffs]

1314
00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:59.667
Marcus. I know you're all stressed out
before your million dollar meeting.

1315
00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:03.500
but I was just trying
to do something special for my daughter.

1316
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:05.250
Now it's ruined.

1317
00:59:06.375 --> 00:59:07.375
Look. Reese. I--

1318
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:11.500
I-I didn't know it was
a father-daughter moment. okay? I'm sorry.

1319
00:59:12.125 --> 00:59:14.333
Yeah. well. hey.
it's a little late for sorry.

1320
00:59:15.083 --> 00:59:19.667
And to think I came in here to tell you
all about this great day trip I booked.

1321
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:20.875
A day trip?

1322
00:59:20.958 --> 00:59:22.167
Yeah. snorkeling.

1323
00:59:23.125 --> 00:59:26.375
I found out about this secret spot
that's supposed to be amazing.

1324
00:59:27.542 --> 00:59:30.458
Ah. never mind.
the vibe is too shitty now.

1325
00:59:31.042 --> 00:59:32.708
No. hey!

1326
00:59:32.792 --> 00:59:34.583
Reese. you stop that crazy talk. okay?

1327
00:59:35.583 --> 00:59:36.917
Snorkeling is a great idea.

1328
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.417
-Right. Kyla?
-Yeah. Dad.

1329
00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:39.458
-Really.
-Ah.

1330
00:59:39.542 --> 00:59:41.333
Yeah. Right. Marcus?

1331
00:59:42.250 --> 00:59:43.458
Right. Marcus?

1332
00:59:43.542 --> 00:59:45.542
Right. Marcus?

1333
00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:48.167
Right. Marcus?

1334
00:59:49.917 --> 00:59:53.125
Aight. look. if y'all wanna go snorkeling.
I'm in. Shit.

1335
00:59:53.208 --> 00:59:56.708
-Yay! Everyone's happy again!
-Fuck yeah! Let's do this!

1336
00:59:57.542 --> 00:59:58.542
-Right.
-[chuckles]

1337
00:59:58.625 --> 01:00:02.000
Oh. my God. Dad! Look. I brought Mom.

1338
01:00:02.708 --> 01:00:06.333
I thought we could spread her when
we're done here. Or. you know. 99% of her.

1339
01:00:06.958 --> 01:00:09.667
-That's great.
-[Emily] Wait. Reese. hold up.

1340
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:11.667
We're flying in there? In that?

1341
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:14.083
-[Reese] Awesome. right?
-Reese. no. I can't fly nowhere.

1342
01:00:14.167 --> 01:00:16.292
I got a big meeting tomorrow
I gotta prepare for.

1343
01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:19.625
Well then you should thank me because
we're gonna get there ten times faster.

1344
01:00:19.708 --> 01:00:21.000
That is some great thinking. Reese.

1345
01:00:21.083 --> 01:00:23.208
No seats! It's so rustic!

1346
01:00:23.292 --> 01:00:24.667
[Reese] Come on. Marcus.

1347
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:27.708
I got it all handled. There's even
a boat waiting for us and everything.

1348
01:00:27.792 --> 01:00:28.792
Right. Captain?

1349
01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:31.917
-[Kyla] I am so excited. Dad.
-[Reese chuckles]

1350
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.208
You guys. it's gonna be so fun!

1351
01:00:33.292 --> 01:00:35.917
[Reese] Oh. honey.
Just wait until you get in the water.

1352
01:00:36.543 --> 01:00:37.917
[ship horn blows]

1353
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
[siren wailing in distance]

1354
01:00:44.958 --> 01:00:48.667
Reese. what the fuck is this?
This place sucks!

1355
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:53.458
Think you gotta go out further. Yeah.
Oh. I think I see some dolphins.

1356
01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:55.625
-What?
-Yeah. yeah. Go!

1357
01:01:00.875 --> 01:01:04.583
We're just a happy family snorkeling.
Nothing to see here.

1358
01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:11.375
[Reese grunts. pants]

1359
01:01:11.458 --> 01:01:14.042
-Is this all of them?
-Nah. man. Me think there's one more.

1360
01:01:14.625 --> 01:01:16.000
Hurry up. Jerome. Come on.

1361
01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:32.208
[baby Marcus crying]

1362
01:01:32.292 --> 01:01:34.667
[Maurillio]
Okay. somebody's getting upset.

1363
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:37.125
Somebody's getting more upset. and…

1364
01:01:37.875 --> 01:01:40.250
-Okay. Let's go wrap you.
-[crying continues]

1365
01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:43.583
[sighs. speaks in Spanish]

1366
01:01:44.375 --> 01:01:45.500
[in English] I'm no killer.

1367
01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.000
[in Spanish]

1368
01:01:55.375 --> 01:01:56.708
[person. in English] Excuse me?

1369
01:01:57.583 --> 01:02:00.542
I-- Hi. I-I don't mean
to be forward. I just--

1370
01:02:01.042 --> 01:02:03.708
I have to tell you
that I have never seen a man

1371
01:02:03.792 --> 01:02:05.417
with a better touch
with his baby than you.

1372
01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.292
Oh. eh. Thank you. señora.

1373
01:02:07.917 --> 01:02:10.167
-It's Veronika.
-Ah. Thank you. Veronika.

1374
01:02:10.667 --> 01:02:13.958
I am Maurillio.
But this Caucasian baby is not mine.

1375
01:02:15.208 --> 01:02:16.208
Seriously?

1376
01:02:16.292 --> 01:02:19.250
Oh. yes. I have no children.
uh. that I know of.

1377
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:25.083
I am kidding. I am childless.

1378
01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:28.000
-Can I ask you a question?
-Mm-hmm.

1379
01:02:29.208 --> 01:02:30.667
Are you doing anything later?

1380
01:02:41.708 --> 01:02:44.917
[groans] Oh. God.
that was fucking disgusting.

1381
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.125
Wait. what is that shit?

1382
01:02:47.958 --> 01:02:49.083
You mean the jellyfish?

1383
01:02:49.167 --> 01:02:50.875
I saw all too clearly what it was.

1384
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.375
For recreational waters.
these conditions are deplorable.

1385
01:02:54.458 --> 01:02:55.875
I'm not talking about that.

1386
01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.917
Wha-What Reese got going on? Fuck this.

1387
01:03:00.542 --> 01:03:02.625
We are definitely gonna need
tetanus shots.

1388
01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:04.125
This is disgusting.

1389
01:03:04.208 --> 01:03:05.333
[moans]

1390
01:03:08.917 --> 01:03:10.583
-[Marcus groans]
-[Reese] Hey. Sorry.

1391
01:03:10.667 --> 01:03:12.292
I was just about to call you in.

1392
01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:13.500
-[Marcus] Is that right?
-Yeah.

1393
01:03:13.583 --> 01:03:15.083
Visibility is not so great today. huh?

1394
01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:18.167
-Reese. what are these bags?
-What bags?

1395
01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:21.042
"What bags"? You fucking with me--
I'm talking about these bags here.

1396
01:03:21.125 --> 01:03:23.833
-Oh. yeah.
-Reese? Reese! Somebody's got eyes on us.

1397
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.292
[Reese] Ah. fuck!

1398
01:03:26.875 --> 01:03:28.792
[Jerome] We gotta get moving. like. now!

1399
01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:35.708
Okay. kids. Time to pack up
and head out. Right now.

1400
01:03:35.792 --> 01:03:37.375
Reese. seriously. What's in these bags?

1401
01:03:37.458 --> 01:03:39.042
-Come on.
-What's with the crazy rush?

1402
01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:41.250
Oh. man. That's--
It's a really funny story.

1403
01:03:41.333 --> 01:03:43.250
-[Kyla] Oh? Tell me!
-Oh. I will. baby.

1404
01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:45.125
But on the way back. okay? Come on.

1405
01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:46.375
-[Kyla] Okay.
-[Ron] Hey. uh.

1406
01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:48.000
don't we have to tie up the boat?

1407
01:03:48.083 --> 01:03:49.625
No. Ron. It's okay. just leave it.

1408
01:03:49.708 --> 01:03:51.375
All right. everybody in.

1409
01:03:51.458 --> 01:03:53.917
We can catch that beautiful sunset. right?

1410
01:03:54.417 --> 01:03:56.750
And dig into that fancy bottle of rum
you bought.

1411
01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.583
[Kyla] Oh. that sounds good!

1412
01:04:00.833 --> 01:04:03.042
[engine sputters]

1413
01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:04.292
Fuck!

1414
01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:06.875
[in Spanish] Attention.
This is the National Cuban Police.

1415
01:04:06.958 --> 01:04:07.958
[in English] Oh. no.

1416
01:04:08.042 --> 01:04:09.875
[in Spanish]
You have entered Cuban territory.

1417
01:04:09.958 --> 01:04:11.417
[in English] But who the hell are they?

1418
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.125
[Reese] Oh. yeah.
Must be the local game wardens.

1419
01:04:14.208 --> 01:04:17.583
and they-- they are really strict
about snorkeling in Cuba. so come on.

1420
01:04:17.667 --> 01:04:20.667
Cuba. Hey! Fucker--
You brought us to Cuba?

1421
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:21.792
Yeah. yeah. But it's okay.

1422
01:04:21.875 --> 01:04:23.542
We just don't wanna deal with them.
Come on.

1423
01:04:23.625 --> 01:04:25.208
-Shit.
-[engine sputters]

1424
01:04:25.292 --> 01:04:26.625
[Reese] Jerome. please!

1425
01:04:26.708 --> 01:04:28.000
I'm trying!

1426
01:04:29.083 --> 01:04:30.458
Jerome? Reese?

1427
01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:32.083
What?

1428
01:04:32.167 --> 01:04:33.833
I do want to deal with them.

1429
01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:37.417
That is the filthiest snorkeling site
I've ever seen.

1430
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.792
-No. you really don't wanna--
-[Ron] No. Reese.

1431
01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:40.875
As a park ranger.

1432
01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:44.250
it's not the first time I've had to call
out the negligence of game wardens.

1433
01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:46.958
-Kyla? My credentials?
-Oh. got it. Got it. got it. Right here.

1434
01:04:47.042 --> 01:04:49.500
-[engine sputtering]
-[Cuban police continue indistinctly]

1435
01:04:53.458 --> 01:04:54.458
Gentlemen!

1436
01:04:55.333 --> 01:04:56.542
Over here!

1437
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.917
Just gonna find out who's in charge.

1438
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.625
Whoever is. is about to get their ass--
Oh. shit!

1439
01:05:07.292 --> 01:05:09.583
-Ron! You gotta get the fuck in here!
-[Reese] Come on!

1440
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.542
Go! Go!

1441
01:05:11.625 --> 01:05:12.917
[Jerome] Get in! Get in!

1442
01:05:13.792 --> 01:05:15.000
-[Ron grunts]
-[Kyla screams]

1443
01:05:18.292 --> 01:05:20.500
-What is happening?
-Why are they shooting at us?

1444
01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.542
-What the fuck is going on?
-[shouts]

1445
01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:24.250
[Emily screams]

1446
01:05:25.917 --> 01:05:26.833
Shit!

1447
01:05:26.917 --> 01:05:28.958
-Can you take off already?
-[Jerome] I can't.

1448
01:05:29.042 --> 01:05:31.250
-We're too fucking heavy.
-[Reese] What?

1449
01:05:31.333 --> 01:05:32.625
Toss something! Now!

1450
01:05:32.708 --> 01:05:33.708
[Kyla] What the--

1451
01:05:33.792 --> 01:05:34.958
[Reese grunts]

1452
01:05:37.792 --> 01:05:39.000
[groans]

1453
01:05:47.333 --> 01:05:48.458
I love you. Mom!

1454
01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:05.792
[sighs] And I came on this trip
with all of these stupid expectations.

1455
01:06:05.875 --> 01:06:08.542
Like. I'm a single woman. right?
I'm available.

1456
01:06:08.625 --> 01:06:11.917
Oh. you are more than available.
You are ready to meet someone.

1457
01:06:12.667 --> 01:06:16.333
What was I thinking? The reality is.
I've barely left the resort all week.

1458
01:06:17.375 --> 01:06:19.000
But then I saw you and--

1459
01:06:19.083 --> 01:06:21.542
The world of possibilities just opened up?

1460
01:06:22.042 --> 01:06:24.042
Yes! Exactly!

1461
01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:26.625
-[laughs] Would you get out of my brain?
-I don't want to.

1462
01:06:26.708 --> 01:06:28.208
[both laughing]

1463
01:06:29.375 --> 01:06:33.375
You know. I heard that the casino in town
is supposed to be great.

1464
01:06:34.083 --> 01:06:35.083
Coral Cay?

1465
01:06:35.167 --> 01:06:38.667
Oh. yes. It's supposed to be magnificent.

1466
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:41.958
Well. then I guess there's just
one thing left to ask.

1467
01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.333
How much do you charge?

1468
01:06:50.167 --> 01:06:52.500
I mean for the whole night.
'Cause if I'm going. I wanna go deep.

1469
01:06:52.583 --> 01:06:56.000
Quick question.
Uh. what exactly are you looking for?

1470
01:06:56.083 --> 01:06:57.875
Hmm? Someone to watch my baby.

1471
01:06:58.792 --> 01:07:00.208
-Baby?
-Yeah!

1472
01:07:00.292 --> 01:07:02.167
-Hi. little bubs.
-Oh. look at that baby.

1473
01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:03.375
[Maurillio] Oh.

1474
01:07:03.458 --> 01:07:06.042
[gasps] Isn't he so cute?

1475
01:07:06.542 --> 01:07:08.125
-[Maurillio chuckles]
-[mumbles]

1476
01:07:12.042 --> 01:07:14.542
Oh. I-I didn't even ask.

1477
01:07:15.042 --> 01:07:16.083
How was the snorkeling?

1478
01:07:16.167 --> 01:07:17.917
It was just okay.

1479
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:20.292
Fuck that! See what's in there--

1480
01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:23.042
Hey. wait. What are you doing?
Marcus. no. no. no.

1481
01:07:23.125 --> 01:07:26.000
-[Marcus] What's in this bag. right--
-Hey. no. Do not open that--

1482
01:07:28.542 --> 01:07:29.542
Reese?

1483
01:07:30.167 --> 01:07:32.000
Whose money is this. huh?

1484
01:07:32.083 --> 01:07:33.250
Whose money is this?

1485
01:07:33.333 --> 01:07:34.458
[screams]

1486
01:07:36.208 --> 01:07:37.583
[engine sputters]

1487
01:07:38.167 --> 01:07:40.708
Um. Shit. shit.
I think we got a problem. brother.

1488
01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:43.292
-They must've hit a fuel line.
-The fuel line?

1489
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.250
[sighs]

1490
01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:47.042
Don't tell me that's Lower St. James.

1491
01:07:47.125 --> 01:07:49.000
[sighs] That's Lower St. James.

1492
01:07:57.208 --> 01:08:00.042
[airplane engine sputtering]

1493
01:08:00.125 --> 01:08:01.542
Okay. we cannot land there.

1494
01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:02.625
[Jerome] No shit!

1495
01:08:02.708 --> 01:08:05.583
[Reese] The hotel's just over that bridge.
Turn. turn. turn.

1496
01:08:05.667 --> 01:08:06.667
[Jerome] I got it!

1497
01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:09.375
All right. Can you make it
to the other side of the island?

1498
01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:10.667
Yeah. man. Definitely.

1499
01:08:13.292 --> 01:08:15.500
-[crashes]
-[engine stops]

1500
01:08:16.167 --> 01:08:18.375
[crashing]

1501
01:08:18.458 --> 01:08:19.917
[Warren] Hold on right there.

1502
01:08:23.458 --> 01:08:25.125
Now what the fuck was that?

1503
01:08:25.208 --> 01:08:27.667
I could've sworn that was Jerome's plane.

1504
01:08:29.375 --> 01:08:30.708
Jerome?

1505
01:08:35.583 --> 01:08:36.833
[Marcus coughs]

1506
01:08:36.918 --> 01:08:37.710
[Emily coughs]

1507
01:08:39.167 --> 01:08:40.792
[Kyla coughs]

1508
01:08:40.875 --> 01:08:43.750
[pants] That was not a fun crash.

1509
01:08:43.833 --> 01:08:45.833
-[Emily grunts. pants]
-[Reese grunts]

1510
01:08:46.708 --> 01:08:47.958
Is everybody okay?

1511
01:08:48.042 --> 01:08:49.042
I'm good. Everybody else?

1512
01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.500
-[Kyla] Yeah.
-[Reese] All good.

1513
01:08:50.583 --> 01:08:52.417
-[Kyla] God. I keep--
-[Reese] Except for Jerome.

1514
01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.292
Oh. God. no. Did he not make it?

1515
01:08:54.375 --> 01:08:57.792
Oh. he did. And he just fucked me
out of a million bucks.

1516
01:08:57.875 --> 01:08:58.958
What a dick.

1517
01:08:59.042 --> 01:09:00.708
I thought we were friends!

1518
01:09:02.583 --> 01:09:04.875
Okay. guys. That was a goddamn commotion.

1519
01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:08.208
So. yeah. we should--
We should get all our stuff and go.

1520
01:09:09.375 --> 01:09:10.375
Shit!

1521
01:09:10.875 --> 01:09:12.250
I have no bars. Fuck!

1522
01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:14.000
-Baby.
-Hey. where you going?

1523
01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:16.042
-[Emily] Baby. wait. What is--
-[Marcus] Shit.

1524
01:09:16.125 --> 01:09:17.667
[Reese] Marcus. what are you doing?

1525
01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:20.625
Something I should've did a long time ago
is to call the cops on your ass.

1526
01:09:20.708 --> 01:09:24.542
-Shit. I can't get a signal.
-No. no. No cops. Will you listen to me?

1527
01:09:24.625 --> 01:09:25.833
We need to get out of here.

1528
01:09:25.917 --> 01:09:28.917
Look. I'm not fucking moving. okay?
Until you tell us the truth. okay?

1529
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.417
Look. what is all this shit?

1530
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.417
Dad. there's gotta be. like. a perfectly
innocent explanation for all this. right?

1531
01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:36.250
Okay. fine. All right. look.

1532
01:09:36.333 --> 01:09:39.583
I'm gonna give you the God's honest.
All my cards. plunk. on the table.

1533
01:09:40.167 --> 01:09:42.500
When I heard
that I was gonna get out of prison.

1534
01:09:42.583 --> 01:09:44.708
was my first thought to come see you?

1535
01:09:44.792 --> 01:09:48.125
To belatedly celebrate
my beautiful daughter's nuptials?

1536
01:09:48.208 --> 01:09:50.708
-Yes. Yes. it was.
-[chuckles] See?

1537
01:09:51.208 --> 01:09:52.750
-Thank you.
-[Reese chuckles]

1538
01:09:52.833 --> 01:09:54.875
You know. me being away
and out of your life.

1539
01:09:54.958 --> 01:09:57.958
I just thought that there's no way
I could ever make it up to you.

1540
01:09:58.042 --> 01:10:02.208
But when I told the other guys in prison
that I was headed for the Caribbean.

1541
01:10:02.292 --> 01:10:05.417
well. this very nice dude
named Frankie in D-block.

1542
01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:09.625
he told me about a plane that went down
in the waters off Cuba.

1543
01:10:09.708 --> 01:10:13.292
-[Kyla] Hmm.
-A plane containing five million dollars.

1544
01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:15.708
And then I thought. boom!

1545
01:10:15.792 --> 01:10:18.083
That's my big wedding present to you.

1546
01:10:18.167 --> 01:10:19.333
Minus my cut. of course.

1547
01:10:19.417 --> 01:10:20.792
That's so sweet.

1548
01:10:21.292 --> 01:10:22.292
Kyla!

1549
01:10:22.792 --> 01:10:25.042
What? He's being thoughtful.

1550
01:10:25.125 --> 01:10:28.458
Thoughtful?
Whose plane and whose money is this?

1551
01:10:28.542 --> 01:10:30.958
-Is that really important right now?
-It actually kind of is.

1552
01:10:31.042 --> 01:10:34.083
Reese. whose fucking money is it? Huh?

1553
01:10:34.167 --> 01:10:36.667
A drug dealer's. That-- that guy. Warren.

1554
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:38.375
Warren. Warren. Warren.

1555
01:10:39.708 --> 01:10:40.750
From the casino?

1556
01:10:40.833 --> 01:10:42.458
[Reese] Yeah. can we get moving?

1557
01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:45.333
Because that was a super loud crash.

1558
01:10:45.833 --> 01:10:48.708
And trust me. Warren's gonna eventually
find out where we are.

1559
01:10:48.792 --> 01:10:49.917
-Wait. what?
-What?

1560
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.333
Yes. Come on. can we just get the money
out of the plane before he--

1561
01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:55.875
[screams] Oh. my God.

1562
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:07.250
[Reese] Aw. I had it.
I had it right in my hands.

1563
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:09.708
-[Warren] Over there!
-Oh. fuck.

1564
01:11:12.292 --> 01:11:13.292
It's Reese.

1565
01:11:14.125 --> 01:11:15.333
I fucking knew it.

1566
01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:17.417
-[Marcus scream]
-[Emily] Shit! [screams]

1567
01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.375
[all scream]

1568
01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:19.583
-Go. go.
-Let's get out of here.

1569
01:11:19.667 --> 01:11:20.792
-Cut them off!
-[shooter] Okay!

1570
01:11:20.875 --> 01:11:22.917
Come on… We're on the move!

1571
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.417
-[Ron] Go!
-[Kyla screams]

1572
01:11:25.917 --> 01:11:27.708
[Emily] Go! Keep going!

1573
01:11:27.792 --> 01:11:29.250
-[Ron] Go!
-[Kyla screams]

1574
01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:33.583
[Warren] Get them!

1575
01:11:33.667 --> 01:11:34.667
[Marcus] Oh!

1576
01:11:35.417 --> 01:11:38.458
[pants] Okay. the body's reaction
to gunfire is a surge of adrenaline.

1577
01:11:38.542 --> 01:11:39.542
It's good. Harness it.

1578
01:11:39.625 --> 01:11:41.875
Just don't let it overwhelm you.
you might give in to panic.

1579
01:11:41.958 --> 01:11:44.750
[Marcus] Panic has already happened.
What if I've already given in to panic?

1580
01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.875
[cell phone rings]

1581
01:11:46.958 --> 01:11:48.833
Zeke! Thank God! Zeke. listen to me!

1582
01:11:48.917 --> 01:11:50.583
-Okay. so the slate's in the budget.
- Listen!

1583
01:11:50.667 --> 01:11:53.000
-But there's one little surprise.
- Damn it! Shit. motherfucker!

1584
01:11:53.083 --> 01:11:55.917
-Shut the fuck up!
- Now this is probably gonna freak you out.

1585
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.375
-but I decided to change…
- Zeke just--

1586
01:11:57.458 --> 01:11:58.708
-…the font in one section.
- Please--

1587
01:11:58.792 --> 01:12:01.708
- I tried Helvetica. Times New Roman--
-Shit! Listen! Motherfucker. shut up!

1588
01:12:01.792 --> 01:12:03.500
-You don't understand!
- No. no. Trust me.

1589
01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:05.292
-It looks better bigger.
-[Marcus screams]

1590
01:12:05.375 --> 01:12:07.167
I don't give a fuck
about that shit right now!

1591
01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:09.500
…trying to fucking kill me--

1592
01:12:12.208 --> 01:12:13.667
I lost him! Shit!

1593
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:15.917
So. how'd he take it?

1594
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.583
Hmm. Better than I thought.

1595
01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:19.333
[Reese] Come on!

1596
01:12:19.417 --> 01:12:20.583
[Emily screams]

1597
01:12:22.583 --> 01:12:23.667
[Reese] Come on!

1598

-[Marcus panting]
-[Emily] Come on. baby. Hurry up! Come on.

1601
01:12:34.542 --> 01:12:35.708
-Yo! Yo.

1602
01:12:36.792 --> 01:12:38.792
-[whispers] Go. go. go. go.
-[Emily pants]

1603
01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:39.875
[Kyla] Go.

1604
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:44.333
[whispers] Get in there. Get--

1605
01:12:46.125 --> 01:12:48.208
-[Reese stammers]
-Okay. Shh. shh. shh. shh.

1606
01:12:57.708 --> 01:12:58.958
[car engine stops]

1607
01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.042
Now where the fuck did they go?

1608
01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:39.250
-[cell phone chimes]
-[automated voice] You are ovulating.

1609
01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:48.167
[babies crying]

1610
01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:49.792
[Maurillio panting]

1611
01:13:50.875 --> 01:13:52.083

[grunts]

1613
01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.417
[in Spanish]

1614
01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.375
-[knocking]
-[sighs]

1615
01:14:06.292 --> 01:14:08.167
[in English] Oh. Hey. Yeon. Come on in.

1616
01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:09.458
Thanks. Uh…

1617
01:14:09.542 --> 01:14:13.333
I just wanted to check in with Mr. Parker
to see if he's. uh. okay with--

1618
01:14:16.417 --> 01:14:18.125
Wait. Why are there two babies here?

1619
01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:20.667
Yes. I am asking myself
that very question.

1620
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:21.750
Okay. uh.

1621
01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:24.083
Anyway. I just wanted to check in
with Mr. Parker

1622
01:14:24.167 --> 01:14:27.042
to see if he's feeling good
about the presentation tomorrow.

1623
01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:29.583
Because he seemed
a little stressed this morning.

1624
01:14:29.667 --> 01:14:32.250
Oh. Well he's still
on his snorkeling trip.

1625
01:14:33.042 --> 01:14:35.500
-Without me.
-He went on a snorkeling trip?

1626
01:14:35.583 --> 01:14:37.250
Mm-hmm. Without me.

1627
01:14:37.333 --> 01:14:38.333
Huh.

1628
01:14:38.833 --> 01:14:41.750
Well. then I guess
he must have everything under control.

1629
01:14:42.333 --> 01:14:43.500
[babies crying]

1630
01:14:43.583 --> 01:14:45.417
I also have everything under control.

1631
01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.250
[crying continues]

1632
01:14:49.917 --> 01:14:51.708
[Reese] Look. Warren. I get it. I get it.

1633
01:14:51.792 --> 01:14:54.250
You really want some answers here.
but it's getting late.

1634
01:14:54.333 --> 01:14:56.667
So I was thinking we just pick this up
in the morning.

1635
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:58.042
Shut the fuck up!

1636
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.208
You're not so tough. when your muscle
have an Uzi pointed at him. Eh?

1637
01:15:05.917 --> 01:15:07.667
-Muscle?
-Kyla.

1638
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:09.625
tell your dad to stop playing around.

1639
01:15:09.708 --> 01:15:13.125
Dad. Why don't you honestly
just tell him what happened?

1640
01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:14.458
Yeah.

1641
01:15:14.542 --> 01:15:17.083
Yeah. Reese. Tell me.

1642
01:15:18.458 --> 01:15:21.000
Tell me where the fuck my money is!

1643
01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:23.542
Warren. I-I am out of moves here. okay?

1644
01:15:23.625 --> 01:15:27.167
I'm gonna give you the God's honest.
All my cards. plunk. on the table.

1645
01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:29.333
-[Warren] Mm-hmm.
-Oh. not this.

1646
01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.917
Did I intend to take your money?

1647
01:15:32.625 --> 01:15:33.625
Yes.

1648
01:15:34.292 --> 01:15:37.958
But then the Cubans showed up
and started shooting up our plane.

1649
01:15:38.042 --> 01:15:39.042
So. I--

1650
01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:42.000
I never got to it.

1651
01:15:43.042 --> 01:15:44.667
Your money is still down there.

1652
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.833
Under the water. where it's always been.

1653
01:15:47.833 --> 01:15:50.375
So how about if I just give you
the coordinates. all right?

1654
01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:54.667
And then you guys can-- can go get it.
then we'll just-- We'll call it a day.

1655
01:16:01.125 --> 01:16:03.875
Yeah. okay. Look. here.
I'm gonna write it down.

1656
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:11.875
Okay?

1657
01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:16.083
Yeah. well…

1658
01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:19.792
-See? He's so smart.
-[whispers] Oh. God.

1659
01:16:20.875 --> 01:16:21.917
[Reese grunts]

1660
01:16:22.492 --> 01:16:23.875
[ship horn blows]

1661
01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.625
[inhales sharply]
You know something. right now…

1662
01:16:30.708 --> 01:16:34.917
is about when I'd be running through
my presentation for the last time.

1663
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.917
Then I'd call Zeke up. you know.

1664
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.417
yell at him to get the blood pumping.
and then I'd put my suit on and--

1665
01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:41.583
[chuckles]

1666
01:16:41.667 --> 01:16:43.750
Make sure everything is right.
look through the papers.

1667
01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:45.333
make sure I got everything together…

1668
01:16:45.417 --> 01:16:48.083
And then I'd go in the bathroom
and look right in the mirror.

1669
01:16:49.167 --> 01:16:50.375
And I'd tell myself.

1670
01:16:51.375 --> 01:16:52.708
"You got this. playboy.

1671
01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:54.667
You fucking got this."

1672
01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:57.083
[scoffs. sighs]

1673
01:16:57.833 --> 01:16:59.750
-[Emily] Hmm.
-But instead…

1674
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.250
I'm in a fucking box.

1675
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.333
So thank you. Reese. Thank you so much.

1676
01:17:08.417 --> 01:17:09.458
You're welcome.

1677
01:17:11.292 --> 01:17:12.292
Really. Reese?

1678
01:17:12.375 --> 01:17:14.417
Well. hey.
I bought us a little time. didn't I?

1679
01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.625
Look. if they find the plane. right?

1680
01:17:16.708 --> 01:17:19.792
And see no money's in there. what the fuck
you think is gonna happen. huh?

1681
01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:22.208
Well. Marcus.
I haven't figured that part out yet.

1682
01:17:22.292 --> 01:17:23.875
-God.
-You haven't figured that part out?

1683
01:17:24.458 --> 01:17:27.125
Reese hasn't figured that part out yet.
Wow.

1684
01:17:27.208 --> 01:17:30.042
I mean. it feels like you
just know all types of shit.

1685
01:17:30.125 --> 01:17:33.625
But you-- But you haven't figured
that part out yet? Great job.

1686
01:17:33.708 --> 01:17:35.417
Marcus. I'm not sure
if you're being sarcastic.

1687
01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.375
but I don't think there's
any reason to make my dad

1688
01:17:37.458 --> 01:17:39.542
out to be the bad guy here.

1689
01:17:41.292 --> 01:17:42.417
But he is the bad guy.

1690
01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:46.042
What did you just say?

1691
01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:49.083
Kyla. Marcus is right.
Reese is the bad guy here.

1692
01:17:50.125 --> 01:17:53.375
Ever since he showed up. he turned
this relaxing family vacation into chaos.

1693
01:17:53.458 --> 01:17:56.167
Total chaos. Who does that? [huffs]

1694
01:17:57.125 --> 01:17:59.500
-Kyla.
-Yeah?

1695
01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:01.583
Kyla. there's something
I need to say to you. and--

1696
01:18:01.667 --> 01:18:03.958
It is not gonna be easy to hear.

1697
01:18:04.875 --> 01:18:06.917
-But I'm gonna say it anyway.
-Okay.

1698
01:18:07.542 --> 01:18:09.292
You know how everybody likes me?

1699
01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:11.208
Everyone on planet Earth.

1700
01:18:11.875 --> 01:18:16.167
Everybody does. Except for your father.

1701
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:17.708
[scoffs]

1702
01:18:17.792 --> 01:18:18.792
What?

1703
01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.125
-That's impossible.
-That's not all.

1704
01:18:24.042 --> 01:18:25.500
You know how I like everyone?

1705
01:18:25.583 --> 01:18:27.625
Everyone you've ever met.

1706
01:18:30.917 --> 01:18:34.583
There is a small piece of me… [sighs]

1707
01:18:35.875 --> 01:18:38.250
-…that doesn't like him. I said it.
-[gasps] Ron!

1708
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:41.125
Well. I guess that evens things out then.

1709
01:18:41.208 --> 01:18:43.083
What the hell's your problem. Reese?

1710
01:18:43.167 --> 01:18:45.167
It's like everything out of your mouth's
an insult to me.

1711
01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:48.667
-Like you're in some contest with me.
-Uh. It's hardly a contest.

1712
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:50.292
-Guys. you don't--
-Wanna know what I think?

1713
01:18:50.375 --> 01:18:52.833
You're the one who feels inadequate.
I think you feel threatened by me.

1714
01:18:52.917 --> 01:18:54.458
-Ron!
-What are you now. a therapist?

1715
01:18:54.542 --> 01:18:55.500
This is not the moment

1716
01:18:55.583 --> 01:18:56.875
-to have this conversation--
-The only

1717
01:18:56.958 --> 01:19:00.583
time you were even remotely nice to me
was when you were using me at the casino.

1718
01:19:00.667 --> 01:19:02.542
-'Cause you needed me to be your muscle.
-Fuck.

1719
01:19:02.625 --> 01:19:04.250
Hey. You should be flattered.

1720
01:19:04.333 --> 01:19:07.250
At least it's a step up
from being a fucking park ranger.

1721
01:19:07.333 --> 01:19:10.417
Fuck you! How dare you
belittle that hallowed position!

1722
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.208
Take it back. right now!

1723
01:19:12.292 --> 01:19:14.042
-Take what back?
-Take it back. or there's gonna be

1724
01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:15.833
-some fucking consequences--
-Stop!

1725
01:19:17.458 --> 01:19:20.250
Both of you! Stop!

1726
01:19:21.708 --> 01:19:25.708
We are family whether you like it or not.
you assholes.

1727
01:19:25.792 --> 01:19:27.500
We are going to get out of here.

1728
01:19:27.583 --> 01:19:30.542
And tomorrow we're gonna be sitting
on the beach.

1729
01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:33.417
sipping cocktails. having a great time.

1730
01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.542
So sit the fuck down!

1731
01:19:35.625 --> 01:19:40.417
And remember. everything is gonna be okay.

1732
01:19:41.333 --> 01:19:43.042
[Marcus] What the fuck was that?

1733
01:19:45.667 --> 01:19:46.750
-Oh. my God!
-[Reese] Uh--

1734
01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:48.542
We're moving!

All right. what's the word?

1738
01:19:57.417 --> 01:20:00.917
It's definitely our plane.
It's right where the guy said it would be.

1739
01:20:01.792 --> 01:20:04.125
We're diving down now to get the money.

1740
01:20:04.625 --> 01:20:07.667
All right. We're done with them.

[Reese] What the--

1745
01:20:20.875 --> 01:20:23.333
-[Kyla] They dropped us in the ocean?
-[Reese] Don't worry. Don't worry.

1746
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.667
[muffled shouting]

1747
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:30.542
-[Marcus] Why's this thing moving?
-[Emily] What's happening. baby?

1748
01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:32.875
-It's filling up with water. We sinking?
-[Reese] It's all right.

1749
01:20:32.958 --> 01:20:34.125
We're sinking!

1751
01:20:35.958 --> 01:20:39.500
Relax. relax. We're not sinking. okay?
These things can float for days.

1752
01:20:39.583 --> 01:20:40.833
How the fuck do you know that?

1753
01:20:40.917 --> 01:20:42.458
Imports. exports. remember?

1754
01:20:42.958 --> 01:20:45.667

as long as we're floating. we're fine.

-[Kyla] Let us out right now! Help!

01:21:00.542 --> 01:21:02.708

don't sink. Reese!

1764
01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:17.125
-Tell us what to do!
-[Ron] One thing left to do.

-[Kyla] Goddamn it! Help!
-[Emily] Get us out of here!

1766
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.375
That's what you're gonna do
right the fuck now?

1767
01:21:22.458 --> 01:21:24.667
-[Reese] Let us out!
-Old park ranger trick.

1768
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:26.208
Used to teach it to all the kids.

1769
01:21:26.292 --> 01:21:27.875
-Help!
-You taught the kids to smoke weed?

1770
01:21:27.958 --> 01:21:30.083
[Ron]
No. I didn't teach them to smoke weed.

1771
01:21:30.167 --> 01:21:32.042
I taught them
if you're ever stuck in a cave.

1772
01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:36.375
find any incendiary material. light it.
and let the smoke lead you out.

-[Emily screams]
-[Kyla] Oh. my God!

1774
01:21:38.542 --> 01:21:41.167
'Cause it always finds a way out.

[Emily cries] Please!

1776
01:21:45.208 --> 01:21:48.208
There. The weak point. It's right there.

1777
01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:53.917
-Get ready.
-To do what?

1778
01:21:55.375 --> 01:21:56.375
Just float.

-Come on. baby!

1781
01:22:21.042 --> 01:22:23.167
Something supposed to happen? Because--

1782
01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:26.583
Yes. it was.
And I don't understand why it didn't.

1783
01:22:26.667 --> 01:22:28.833
That's more than enough force
to breach corroded steel.

1784
01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:30.833
Here comes another flood of bullshit.

1785
01:22:31.958 --> 01:22:34.875
It's not bullshit. Reese.
It's basic physics.

1786
01:22:34.958 --> 01:22:38.000
The pressure differential in here
is much more--

01:23:22.208 --> 01:23:23.833
Okay. First. it's stealing.

1805

-Second--

Dad. did you see that?

1807
01:23:28.583 --> 01:23:31.250
There you go. baby.
You remembered like I taught you!

1808
01:23:32.083 --> 01:23:33.292
What?

1809
01:23:43.042 --> 01:23:44.417
Wait. Wait.

1810
01:23:45.167 --> 01:23:47.417
What do you mean all of the money's gone?

1811
01:23:49.417 --> 01:23:50.792
The every last bag?

1812
01:23:51.583 --> 01:23:53.958
[beeping]

1813
01:23:56.583 --> 01:23:58.875
Uh. Where is my car?

1814
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.500
[Kyla. Emily laughing]

1815
01:24:08.208 --> 01:24:10.208
-[Marcus laughs]
-[Ron] Is anyone back there?

1816
01:24:10.292 --> 01:24:12.583
No. baby. We're good. We made it.

1817
01:24:12.667 --> 01:24:13.708
[laughs. speaks indistinctly]

1818
01:24:13.792 --> 01:24:15.167
Oh. my fucking God.

1819
01:24:15.792 --> 01:24:17.667
Wait. wait. wait. What time is it?

1820
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:19.750
-What time is it?
-Uh. Oh. Here. look.

1821
01:24:19.833 --> 01:24:22.208
Uh. 8:48. Wow.

Eight forty-- Baby. you can still make it!

1823
01:24:24.208 --> 01:24:26.042
[Marcus] Wait. what? Y-You think?

1824
01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:42.417
Okay. We're not far. we're not far.
Shit. shit! I gotta get my focus on.

1825
01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:43.708
Okay. okay. Uh.

1826
01:24:43.792 --> 01:24:46.750
Parker Construction. uh.
was founded in 2007.

1827
01:24:46.833 --> 01:24:49.458
by this kid who knows Chicago
better than anyone.

1828
01:24:49.542 --> 01:24:51.875
That kid is-is Marcus Parker.

1829
01:24:51.958 --> 01:24:53.542
-Honey?
-I see it. babe. Thank you.

[horn honks]

1832
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:02.333
They're right there.

1833
01:25:03.083 --> 01:25:05.417
That's them. It has to be them.

1834
01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.208
Merge left. Merge left!

1835
01:25:07.292 --> 01:25:08.917
Ron! The hotel's right to the left!

1836
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.375
Oh. shit. Ron!
We're actually gonna make it.

1837
01:25:11.458 --> 01:25:13.000
I can't believe you did this. man.

1838
01:25:13.083 --> 01:25:14.500
You know. sometimes I don't believe you.

1839
01:25:14.583 --> 01:25:17.333
but I'm like. "You know something.
this dude is a fucking amazing--

1840
01:25:17.417 --> 01:25:18.875
What the fuck?

1841
01:25:18.958 --> 01:25:20.208
[all scream]

1842
01:25:23.917 --> 01:25:25.458
Goddamn. Warren.

1843
01:25:41.167 --> 01:25:44.000
[chuckles] Great--
Great to see you. Mrs. Kim.

1844
01:25:51.042 --> 01:25:53.250
You know the idea
is to avoid the bullets. right?

1845
01:25:53.333 --> 01:25:54.417
Dad! Leave Ron alone.

1846
01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.750
-He's doing actually a really good job!
-I'm not criticizing.

1847
01:25:56.833 --> 01:25:58.000
-I'm just saying.
-Not helping!

1848
01:25:58.083 --> 01:25:59.542
Shut the fuck up! Okay.

1849
01:25:59.625 --> 01:26:02.542
All right. Unless you got something
you absolutely have to say before we die.

1850
01:26:02.625 --> 01:26:04.125
don't say shit at all!

1851
01:26:05.167 --> 01:26:07.208
-I don't wanna have a baby!
-Wait. what?

1852
01:26:08.875 --> 01:26:10.583
I'm sorry. Marcus. I love you so much.

1853
01:26:10.667 --> 01:26:12.542
and I know we talked about it.
but I just don't.

1854
01:26:12.625 --> 01:26:14.625
You know what's crazy?
I don't wanna have a baby either.

1855
01:26:14.708 --> 01:26:15.667
What?

1856
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:17.792
Yeah. look. I didn't know how to tell you.

1857
01:26:17.875 --> 01:26:20.250
But-But the ovulation tracker.
you were all in.

1858
01:26:20.333 --> 01:26:22.333
That shit was for you.
I didn't wanna do that.

1859
01:26:22.417 --> 01:26:25.542
Baby. I like kids. but. baby.
I just love the way our life is right now.

-[tires squeal]
-[Reese screams]

1861

-Not necessarily right now but you get it.
-I'm so happy for you guys!

1862
01:26:30.417 --> 01:26:32.708
Oh. yeah. Me too. Now hold on.

[Warren] Move it! Move!

1867
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:53.583
[Reese] Holy shit!

1868
01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:56.292
You did it. Ron!
You actually fucking did it!

1869

[all screaming]

1870
01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:04.542
[screaming continues]

1871
01:27:04.625 --> 01:27:07.125
This-This font is quite nice.
don't you think?

1872
01:27:07.708 --> 01:27:09.292
[grunting. shouting]

1873
01:27:09.375 --> 01:27:11.750

1874
01:27:11.833 --> 01:27:13.667
[Emily] Is everyone okay?

1875
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:15.250
-Are we good?
-Is everyone all right?

1876
01:27:15.333 --> 01:27:17.583
-Go! Come on! Go. go. go. go.
-[Marcus grunts] Fuck.

1877
01:27:33.583 --> 01:27:35.125
Raise your fucking hands.

1878
01:27:36.667 --> 01:27:40.083
Oh. God. This is bad.
Kyla. this is really. really bad.

1879
01:27:40.167 --> 01:27:41.167
Hold on. Hold on.

1880
01:27:41.667 --> 01:27:44.542
Ron has. like. a really good touch
with drug dealers.

1881
01:27:44.625 --> 01:27:46.542
Hands up higher. you pussy.

1882
01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:47.667
-Kyla.
-[pants] What?

1883
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:48.875
Drug dealers!

1884
01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:51.208
-Oh. my God. This is it. Come with me.
-Where are you--

1885
01:27:56.708 --> 01:27:59.292
-Maurillio!
-Maurillio! Maurillio!

1886
01:27:59.375 --> 01:28:01.083
-[babies crying]
-[Kyla] Maurillio!

1887
01:28:01.167 --> 01:28:02.583
[cooing]

1888
01:28:02.667 --> 01:28:04.875
-Where is he? Fuck! Is he here?
-[Emily] Check upstairs--

1889
01:28:04.958 --> 01:28:07.167
-In here.
-Oh. my God. Come on. Okay.

1890
01:28:07.667 --> 01:28:09.292
[panting]

1891
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:13.542
-Why are there two babies in here?
-Because I am very clearly not a killer.

1892
01:28:13.625 --> 01:28:15.083
No. no. no. But you are.

1893
01:28:15.167 --> 01:28:18.792
You're Novar. Chencho Novar!

1894
01:28:21.417 --> 01:28:22.667
Wait. What?

1895
01:28:22.835 --> 01:28:25.333
You have one last chance.

1896
01:28:25.958 --> 01:28:27.042
Reese.

1897
01:28:27.708 --> 01:28:30.500
where is my money?

1898
01:28:31.625 --> 01:28:34.083
Pfft. You mean it wasn't on the plane?

1899
01:28:34.167 --> 01:28:37.458
You know. salt water is pretty corrosive.
so maybe--

1900
01:28:37.542 --> 01:28:38.750
Okay. it's torched.

1901
01:28:39.333 --> 01:28:40.708
All of it. torched.

1902
01:28:41.958 --> 01:28:44.792
Believe me. I am more bummed
about this than you are.

1903
01:28:45.583 --> 01:28:46.750
You sure are.

1904
01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:49.833
You sure fucking are.

1905
01:28:49.917 --> 01:28:50.917
[Maurillio] Gentlemen.

1906
01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:56.500
May I ask you to put your guns down?

1907
01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.417
[mouthing] What are you doing?

1908
01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.458
Who the fuck are you?

1909
01:29:02.542 --> 01:29:03.583
-[muttering]
-Go!

1910
01:29:05.875 --> 01:29:06.875
You know my name.

1911
01:29:08.833 --> 01:29:10.625
Perhaps all too well.

1912
01:29:12.083 --> 01:29:14.833
For I am Novar.

1913
01:29:17.542 --> 01:29:18.625
Chencho Novar.

1914
01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.708
You're not no fucking Novar.

1915
01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:25.417
But I am.

1916
01:29:26.833 --> 01:29:27.833
You see…

1917
01:29:28.583 --> 01:29:31.375
nobody knows what I look like
for a reason.

1918
01:29:33.292 --> 01:29:36.458
Unlike you. who is known by so many.

1919
01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:38.500
Warren.

1920
01:29:38.583 --> 01:29:40.833
How you know my fucking name. eh?

1921
01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:42.167
How do I know his name?

1922
01:29:45.167 --> 01:29:46.458
You may run this island.

1923
01:29:47.208 --> 01:29:49.542
You may know everything
that goes on here. But me?

1924
01:29:50.208 --> 01:29:52.292
I know everything that goes on everywhere.

1925
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:57.000
So if I were you.
I would let my friends go.

1926
01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:58.500
Friends?

1927
01:29:59.750 --> 01:30:02.250
-They're with you?
-Oh. Yeah.

1928
01:30:02.333 --> 01:30:03.500
Hey. Novar.

1929
01:30:04.792 --> 01:30:05.958
We're totally with him.

1930
01:30:07.167 --> 01:30:08.917
Because if you do not release them.

1931
01:30:09.417 --> 01:30:14.083
well. the consequences
will be most unpleasant.

1932
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:18.375
Violence…

1933
01:30:19.792 --> 01:30:21.125
she is my sweet lover.

1934
01:30:21.208 --> 01:30:23.500
Uh. Too-- too much Maurillio.
Too-- too much.

1935
01:30:23.583 --> 01:30:25.167
I know. he needs to pull back.

1936
01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:27.833
Perhaps you've seen some
of my cruel handiwork in Cartagena?

1937
01:30:28.333 --> 01:30:29.375
Hmm?

1938
01:30:29.458 --> 01:30:31.792
The bag of heads in Caracas?

1939
01:30:32.292 --> 01:30:35.042
No. you back there
with the BO I can smell from here?

1940
01:30:35.625 --> 01:30:39.625
Well. they made the most impressive
documentary about it.

1941
01:30:40.792 --> 01:30:41.917
You should check it out.

1942
01:30:43.083 --> 01:30:45.375
But that? That will be nothing. Warren.

1943
01:30:45.458 --> 01:30:47.250
If you do not heed my warning.

1944
01:30:47.333 --> 01:30:52.917
this quaint island of yours
will endure horrors you can't imagine.

1945
01:30:53.417 --> 01:30:56.667
The streets bathed in crimson.

1946
01:30:56.750 --> 01:31:01.208
Severed heads affixed upon
all manner of public signage.

1947
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:04.792
The entrails of your beloved ones
strewn across the room--

1948
01:31:04.875 --> 01:31:05.875
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chencho?

1949
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:10.125
Well. you get the point.

1950
01:31:15.833 --> 01:31:18.167
All right. Fine.

1951
01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:21.250
These two can go.

1952
01:31:22.542 --> 01:31:24.500
[whispering] You smart fucking lady.

1953
01:31:24.583 --> 01:31:27.083
Honestly. me don't know
who the fuck them is anyway.

1954
01:31:27.667 --> 01:31:29.833
And I definitely
don't give a fuck who you is.

1955
01:31:30.792 --> 01:31:31.917
But Reese.

1956
01:31:32.875 --> 01:31:35.000
Reese. I want five million for him.

1957
01:31:35.083 --> 01:31:36.333
Or him dead.

1958
01:31:37.667 --> 01:31:38.875
Five million dollars?

1959
01:31:39.417 --> 01:31:41.458
Pfft. No problem.

1960
01:31:43.333 --> 01:31:46.375
[inhales deeply]
Does anybody have five million dollars?

1961
01:31:49.458 --> 01:31:50.583
I do.

1962
01:31:50.667 --> 01:31:51.833
[Marcus] What?

1963
01:31:51.917 --> 01:31:53.083
No. Seriously. I do.

1964
01:31:54.917 --> 01:31:56.208
I believe you have my phone.

1965
01:31:56.292 --> 01:31:58.000
What you want your phone for?

1966
01:31:58.083 --> 01:32:00.833
So I can wire you the money.
You-- I mean. you can watch.

1967
01:32:11.625 --> 01:32:13.958
What-- What is he doing? What's Ron doing?

1968
01:32:14.042 --> 01:32:15.333
I don't know.

1969
01:32:18.417 --> 01:32:21.875
-What kind of bullshit is he pulling?
-I don't know what the fuck he's doing.

1970
01:32:23.708 --> 01:32:25.583
-[cell phone chimes]
-Yeah.

1971
01:32:30.208 --> 01:32:34.375
-All right. We're good here. guys.
-[Warren's guy] Yep. move on.

1972
01:32:34.458 --> 01:32:35.458
-Okay.
-Oh. my God!

1973
01:32:35.542 --> 01:32:36.375
[Emily] What!

1974
01:32:36.458 --> 01:32:37.458
What?

1975
01:32:39.542 --> 01:32:41.792
-Ron. what the fuck did you do?
-[Kyla squeals]

1976
01:32:41.875 --> 01:32:43.792
You're a genius! [squeals]

1977
01:32:43.875 --> 01:32:46.375
Baby! I'm so proud of you!

1978
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.292
-Ron. what the fuck was that?
-I just paid the man.

1979
01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:51.917
With what?
Where'd you get five million dollars from?

1980
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.292
Check this out.

1981
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:57.958
What the hell is Secure Commerce
for Online Markets?

1982
01:32:59.583 --> 01:33:00.708
SCOM-coin!

1983
01:33:01.292 --> 01:33:02.417
Wait. wait. wait.

1984
01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.208
-That crypto thing? That was real?
-[Ron] Yeah.

1985
01:33:04.292 --> 01:33:05.542
Took Reese up on his hot tip.

1986
01:33:05.625 --> 01:33:08.542
Yesterday morning I invested 30K
and it 200x-ed by lunch.

1987
01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:09.625
Oh. my God.

1988
01:33:09.708 --> 01:33:11.125
-You're such a genius.
-Whoa. whoa.

1989
01:33:11.208 --> 01:33:14.417
You-you paid five million bucks for me?

1990
01:33:15.208 --> 01:33:16.583
To save my life?

1991
01:33:16.667 --> 01:33:18.875
[sighs] What can I say? Kyla was right.

1992
01:33:20.083 --> 01:33:21.083
We are family.

1993
01:33:23.083 --> 01:33:24.208
Seriously. son.

1994
01:33:27.292 --> 01:33:28.292
Salaam.

1995
01:33:28.875 --> 01:33:31.250
[whirring]

1996
01:33:34.708 --> 01:33:35.917
-Baby. Go!
-Shit! I gotta--

1997
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.542
-Go!
-Go!

1998
01:33:38.792 --> 01:33:40.583
Mrs. Kim! Mrs. Kim! Wait.

1999
01:33:40.667 --> 01:33:43.458
Hey. hey. hey! You stop that!
You stop the helicopter!

2000
01:33:43.542 --> 01:33:45.125
[panting] Cut it off!

2001
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:46.750
Okay. Mrs. Kim.

2002
01:33:47.250 --> 01:33:50.125
-[pants] I really need you to hear me out.
-I'm sorry. Mr. Parker.

2003
01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:52.958
I have another meeting.
Now if you will excuse me.

2004
01:33:53.042 --> 01:33:55.625
Okay. no! No! No.

2005
01:33:56.125 --> 01:33:59.917
I-I don't-- I don't mean to yell
but I-I can't excuse you.

2006
01:34:00.458 --> 01:34:04.542
Understand this. me and my friends
have been through hell to get here.

2007
01:34:04.625 --> 01:34:05.917
Hell!

2008
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.208
Okay? So this has to happen.

2009
01:34:08.292 --> 01:34:11.792
And if I can be honest with you.
I don't give a fuck no more. All right?

2010
01:34:12.583 --> 01:34:14.667
So if you can. just stand there in your--

2011
01:34:15.167 --> 01:34:16.625
in your perfect outfit

2012
01:34:16.708 --> 01:34:21.875
and your very comfortable heels
and beautiful steamed blouse.

2013
01:34:22.875 --> 01:34:25.125
And just hear me out. Please!

2014
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.292
Please. I got something I gotta say.

2015
01:34:28.917 --> 01:34:29.917
Which is?

2016
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:34.250
Pretend like I have a clicker
'cause I had a whole slideshow.

2017
01:34:35.083 --> 01:34:40.042
[blows] Parker Construction
was founded in 2007.

2018
01:34:41.292 --> 01:34:42.750
-by a kid--
-Stop!

2019
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Mr. Parker.

2020
01:34:47.250 --> 01:34:49.792
In the silence
of that empty conference room.

2021
01:34:50.417 --> 01:34:52.500
I was able to digest your written budget.

2022
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.250
which was quite thorough.

2023
01:34:54.917 --> 01:34:58.167
But I didn't become head of my company
by just analyzing numbers.

2024
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
I did it by listening to my gut.
Mr. Parker.

2025
01:35:02.583 --> 01:35:04.417
Do you know what my gut
is telling me right now?

2026
01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.667
That-that. um--

2027
01:35:06.250 --> 01:35:08.750
That your gut likes--
likes Parker Construct--

2028
01:35:08.833 --> 01:35:09.833
It's telling me…

2029
01:35:10.375 --> 01:35:12.750
I flew you out here.
put you up for a week.

2030
01:35:12.833 --> 01:35:15.208
had my staff tend to your every need.

2031
01:35:15.292 --> 01:35:18.792
and yet you still left me sitting there
for 12 full minutes.

2032
01:35:19.292 --> 01:35:21.792
Now I don't care
if you were held at gunpoint. or if--

2033
01:35:21.875 --> 01:35:24.708
Okay. I'm glad you brought that up
'cause that actually just happened

2034
01:35:24.792 --> 01:35:26.875
-two minutes ago right over there--
-The point…

2035
01:35:26.958 --> 01:35:28.375
is that my gut is never wrong.

2036
01:35:29.958 --> 01:35:34.375
So. I'm quite certain
you are not the man for this job.

2037
01:35:39.375 --> 01:35:40.833
I have a different opinion.

2038
01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:46.625
What did you just say?

2039
01:35:48.833 --> 01:35:50.458
I have a different opinion.

2040
01:35:56.250 --> 01:35:57.250
Oh.

2041
01:35:58.042 --> 01:36:00.708
Baby. Okay. so…

2042
01:36:03.125 --> 01:36:05.167
-He got the job.
-I got the fucking job.

2043
01:36:05.250 --> 01:36:07.333
-[Emily] You got the job?
-I got the fucking job.

2044
01:36:07.417 --> 01:36:08.875
-[Emily] Yes! Baby!
-Fuck yeah. Marcus!

2045
01:36:08.958 --> 01:36:10.750
-[Maurillio] Oh! [laughs]
-[Kyla] Yes!

2046
01:36:10.833 --> 01:36:12.167
We knew you could do it!

2047
01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:14.333
I didn't. but yes!

2048
01:36:15.125 --> 01:36:17.542
[sighs] Baby. I am just so proud of you!

2049
01:36:17.625 --> 01:36:19.125
You know something? Honestly.

2050
01:36:19.792 --> 01:36:21.875
if it wasn't for Yeon.
I wouldn't have the job.

2051
01:36:21.958 --> 01:36:24.250
He-- He really vouched for me. you know?

2052
01:36:24.833 --> 01:36:26.958
[sighs] Yeon. Thank you. brother.

2053
01:36:28.083 --> 01:36:31.833
Yeah. Turns out my opinion
actually does matter.

2054
01:36:32.833 --> 01:36:35.000
This calls for a celebration. Right?

2055
01:36:35.083 --> 01:36:38.375
And when we get some drinks. I'm going
to be the first one to raise my glass to--

2056
01:36:38.458 --> 01:36:41.792
Oh. my God! The babies.

2057
01:36:48.875 --> 01:36:50.750
[Ron] I fucking love this little guy.

2058
01:36:50.833 --> 01:36:52.667
-[Kyla chuckles]
-He's a little genius.

2059
01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:55.292
You guys have any second thoughts?

2060
01:36:55.375 --> 01:36:56.958
-I'm good. you good?
-I'm Gucci.

2061
01:36:57.042 --> 01:36:59.167
-Oh. no. we good.
-We're great. thank you though.

2062
01:36:59.250 --> 01:37:02.458
Hey. hey. But little Marcus
can come visit us anytime he wants to.

2063
01:37:02.542 --> 01:37:03.542
Absolutely. I mean.

2064
01:37:03.625 --> 01:37:06.333
we may even know of a hotel
where you guys can stay at in Chicago.

2065
01:37:06.417 --> 01:37:08.292
[Marcus] Mm-hmm. We may have an idea.

2066
01:37:09.875 --> 01:37:10.875
So. Reese.

2067
01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:13.167
What are you gonna do next?

2068
01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:14.833
Well. actually. uh.

2069
01:37:14.917 --> 01:37:17.833
I think I'll be heading back up
to San Francisco for a bit.

2070
01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:20.708
For. like. ten to 20 years.

2071
01:37:21.583 --> 01:37:22.958
Dad! What?

2072
01:37:24.042 --> 01:37:25.417
Aw. honey.

2073
01:37:26.625 --> 01:37:29.333
I am so goddamn grateful
I got to spend time with you.

2074
01:37:30.583 --> 01:37:34.333
But there's one thing that I haven't
exactly been straight with you about.

2075
01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.292
You do like to shit in front of people?

2076
01:37:37.875 --> 01:37:39.000
No. no. It's--

2077
01:37:39.083 --> 01:37:43.375
It's just that I wasn't really paroled.
like I told you.

2078
01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:45.250
I kinda broke out.

2079
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:48.667
Which was stupid. I know.
But it was worth it. I got to see you.

2080
01:37:50.333 --> 01:37:52.333
You and your family. All of you.

2081
01:37:53.208 --> 01:37:54.375
Reese Hackford?

2082
01:37:55.542 --> 01:37:56.667
That's me.

2083
01:37:56.750 --> 01:38:00.292
-FBI. Hands behind your head. please.
-[agent] Everybody. step back.

2084
01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:02.667
-Come on.
-Thanks for having me. honey.

2085
01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:06.625
-[Reese] I hope I didn't ruin everything.
-Dad. are you kidding?

2086
01:38:06.708 --> 01:38:08.958
I got to snort my own mom.

2087
01:38:10.542 --> 01:38:12.083
This was the best honeymoon ever.

2088
01:38:12.625 --> 01:38:13.708
-And Ron…
-Down on the ground.

2089
01:38:13.792 --> 01:38:15.208
…you were right. [grunts]

2090
01:38:16.292 --> 01:38:17.500
I was threatened by you.

2091
01:38:18.083 --> 01:38:20.333
But you know why? Because you're great.

2092
01:38:20.917 --> 01:38:24.083
In all the ways that I'm not.
And that's a lot of fucking ways.

2093
01:38:24.583 --> 01:38:26.458
Sorry I was such a dick.

2094
01:38:26.542 --> 01:38:29.625
And the truth is
I couldn't imagine a better son-in-law.

2095
01:38:29.708 --> 01:38:30.917
[agent] Come on. Get up.

2096
01:38:31.792 --> 01:38:33.500
-I don't know what to say.
-[chuckles]

2097
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.917
Except for when our kid gets married.

2098
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:38.958
I hope I'm the type of father
that would break out of prison

2099
01:38:39.042 --> 01:38:41.125
to face another ten to 20 years
just to see him.

2100
01:38:41.208 --> 01:38:43.417
-[agent] Time to go. Let's move.
-[police radio chatter]

2101
01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.000
So nice to meet you both.

2102
01:38:45.583 --> 01:38:47.708
-And you too. Chencho.
-Hmm?

2103
01:38:47.792 --> 01:38:50.542
-Okay. It's just a joke. It's a joke.
-[agent] Come on. let's go.

2104
01:38:50.625 --> 01:38:52.292
[Kyla] I love you so much. Daddy.

2105
01:38:52.792 --> 01:38:54.125
Have a great flight.

2106
01:38:57.375 --> 01:38:58.583
What are we doing tonight?

2107
01:38:59.083 --> 01:39:01.375
It's our last night in the Caribbean.

2108
01:39:01.875 --> 01:39:03.792
Well. I have a date.

2109
01:39:03.875 --> 01:39:04.875
With who?

2110
01:39:04.958 --> 01:39:07.000
-With her. Veronika.
-[Emily] Oh.

2111
01:39:07.083 --> 01:39:09.833
I finally found the nerve
to ask her out to dinner.

2112
01:39:09.917 --> 01:39:13.875
You see. playing a drug dealer almost
may have gotten us shot in the face.

2113
01:39:14.375 --> 01:39:16.250
but it also unleashed
something inside of me.

2114
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.917
Apparently. I can be the killer after all.

2115
01:39:20.583 --> 01:39:21.958
Till tomorrow.

2116
01:39:22.042 --> 01:39:23.458
[squeals. laughs]

2117
01:39:23.542 --> 01:39:25.167
[Emily] All right. Chencho.

2118
01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:27.292
[Maurillio] Hi.

2119
01:39:27.375 --> 01:39:28.375
[chatters]

2120
01:39:28.958 --> 01:39:31.292
So what about us. you guys?
Should we get some drinks?

2121
01:39:31.375 --> 01:39:33.583
Yeah. We should definitely
get drinks and dinner.

2122
01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:35.417
And maybe. like. the casino after?

2123
01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.958
Girl. you know I'm not allowed
back in there. Like. ever.

2124
01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:40.167
You know what. you guys go ahead.

2125
01:39:47.208 --> 01:39:49.458
I have some unfinished business
to attend to.

2126
01:39:56.250 --> 01:39:57.250
[blows]
