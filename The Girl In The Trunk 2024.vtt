00:07:25.548 --> 00:07:28.206
A sedan. I guess. I don't know.

71
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.656
And the colour?

72
00:07:30.207 --> 00:07:32.555
I can't tell. It's dark.

73
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.901
A dark sedan.

74
00:07:33.936 --> 00:07:36.456
No. as in dark on the inside.

75
00:07:36.904 --> 00:07:39.044
Is that supposed to be a joke.
ma'am?

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:40.908
On the 911 call?

77
00:07:40.943 --> 00:07:42.772

78
00:07:42.807 --> 00:07:44.878
I'm sorry. I'm just scared!

79
00:07:44.912 --> 00:07:46.638
Do you know the man
who took you?

80
00:07:46.673 --> 00:07:48.053
Have you seen him before?

81
00:07:48.882 --> 00:07:49.986
[sobbing] No.

82
00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:51.781
I didn't even see him now.

83
00:07:51.816 --> 00:07:52.920
Okay.

84
00:07:52.955 --> 00:07:55.716
And what is your name. ma'am?

85
00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:57.580
Amanda. Miss Amanda Jennings.

86
00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:03.655
Are you still there?

87
00:08:04.276 --> 00:08:08.660
Okay. so far
your track shows you

88
00:08:08.695 --> 00:08:12.319
somewhere north
of Houston. non-specific.

89
00:08:12.353 --> 00:08:15.840
We should go over the
confined-in-trunk checklist.

90
00:08:15.874 --> 00:08:18.877
-There's a checklist?
-For everything. ma'am.

91
00:08:18.912 --> 00:08:20.638
First. check if there's

92
00:08:20.672 --> 00:08:22.985
an emergency trunk release
in the car.

93
00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:24.193
A what?

94
00:08:24.227 --> 00:08:26.057
All newer vehicles have them.

95
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:29.198
It should be a small
phosphorescent plastic handle

96
00:08:29.232 --> 00:08:32.615
with a clearly marked
"exit" symbol.

97
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.236
I don't see it. no.

98
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.895
It should be on the lid
somewhere.

99
00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.174
No. it's not here.

100
00:08:40.209 --> 00:08:42.693
Uh. maybe he took it out?

101
00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:45.214
-Yeah.
-Try pressing firmly upwards

102
00:08:45.248 --> 00:08:47.285
with your hands or feet
on the trunk lid.

103
00:08:47.319 --> 00:08:49.080
I already fucking did this!

104
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.739
I'm gonna encourage you
to just take

105
00:08:52.773 --> 00:08:54.775
a few deep breaths. please.

106
00:08:57.915 --> 00:08:59.849
[Amanda inhales
and exhales deeply]

107
00:08:59.884 --> 00:09:01.057
Good.

108
00:09:01.092 --> 00:09:02.852
You're under a lot of stress.

109
00:09:02.887 --> 00:09:05.821
but we're doing all we can
to get you out.

110
00:09:05.855 --> 00:09:08.271
All police in your area
have been notified.

111
00:09:08.306 --> 00:09:10.964
They're all looking for you.
Amanda. all right?

112
00:09:10.998 --> 00:09:13.587
Okay. Thank you.

113
00:09:13.622 --> 00:09:16.694
So we should start working
on your profile.

114
00:09:16.728 --> 00:09:20.145
Where were you
when the abduction took place?

115
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.699
-Houston.
-All right.

116
00:09:21.733 --> 00:09:24.046
Perhaps a little more specific?

117
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.221
Uh. a car rental place.
Sunset-something. I don't know.

118
00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:29.120
Somewhere downtown.

119
00:09:29.154 --> 00:09:31.329
All right. and where
did you come from today?

120
00:09:31.985 --> 00:09:33.365
Dallas. I'm from Dallas.

121
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.126
Uh-huh.

122
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.369
And when will you
be going back?

123
00:09:38.129 --> 00:09:40.096
I won't.

124
00:09:40.131 --> 00:09:41.615
As in...?

125
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.307
Never.
I'm not going back. okay?

126
00:09:44.342 --> 00:09:46.240
Understood.
And what about the car?

127
00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:47.828
What about it?

128
00:09:47.863 --> 00:09:49.658
Shouldn't it be returned
to Dallas?

129
00:09:49.692 --> 00:09:51.314
No. it's a one-way rental.

130
00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:54.076
You pay a fee and then
you can drop it off wherever.

131
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.665
Oh. I see. Clever.

132
00:09:56.699 --> 00:09:58.045
Yeah. I guess so.

133
00:09:59.012 --> 00:10:01.980
Have you received threats
of any kind lately. Amanda?

134
00:10:02.015 --> 00:10:04.086
Anyone who might wish you harm?

135
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.019
No. I... No.

136
00:10:07.192 --> 00:10:09.747
What else can you tell me
about yourself?

137
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:11.093
About myself?

138
00:10:11.127 --> 00:10:14.130
I'm the girl in the trunk.
remember?

139
00:10:14.165 --> 00:10:18.307
Amanda. I'm just looking
for the big picture here.

140
00:10:18.341 --> 00:10:19.929
[softly] The big picture.

141
00:10:20.827 --> 00:10:23.105
I work in a bank. always have.
Management track.

142
00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:26.384
I live alone.
Have friends. but not many.

143
00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:29.042
I love sushi
and long walks on the beach.

144
00:10:29.076 --> 00:10:30.250
Big enough?

145
00:10:31.251 --> 00:10:32.321
It'll do.

146
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:35.807
But let me just clear
something up.

147
00:10:35.842 --> 00:10:39.121
You're saying
you left Dallas today

148
00:10:39.155 --> 00:10:41.951
with no intention
of going back. ever.

149
00:10:42.503 --> 00:10:44.851
Does anyone know where you are?

150
00:10:46.093 --> 00:10:47.198
No.

151
00:10:48.475 --> 00:10:50.442
Could you describe
your clothing for me. please?

152
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.962
My clothing?

153
00:10:52.997 --> 00:10:54.170
Your clothing.

154
00:10:55.068 --> 00:10:57.208
What are you wearing. Amanda?

155
00:10:57.242 --> 00:10:58.381
What am I wearing?

156
00:10:58.415 --> 00:11:01.005
Is this a fucking
dating hotline?

157
00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:03.076
It's for your profile.

158
00:11:04.077 --> 00:11:07.770
A dress.
A white goddamn wedding dress.

159
00:11:07.805 --> 00:11:10.083
A wedding dress?

160
00:11:10.117 --> 00:11:11.187
Amanda...

161
00:11:12.257 --> 00:11:14.259
are you running away
from something?

162
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.711
What the fuck is this?

163
00:11:18.298 --> 00:11:21.922
You must be the worst goddamn
911 operator in the world!

164
00:11:22.785 --> 00:11:25.305
Well. how many
have you actually talked to?

165
00:11:26.064 --> 00:11:29.447
Fuck you. I want to talk
to your supervisor. now!

166
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:31.276
I'm sorry. Amanda.

167
00:11:31.898 --> 00:11:33.382
It's just me.

168
00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:42.184
You're not really...

169
00:11:42.218 --> 00:11:44.427
a 911 operator. are you?

170
00:11:45.946 --> 00:11:48.777
Well. I guess that depends
on the definition.

171
00:11:49.294 --> 00:11:50.917
You did call 911.

172
00:11:50.951 --> 00:11:53.298
and I am definitely
operating the line.

173
00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:56.198
On the other hand.
anyone with root access

174
00:11:56.232 --> 00:11:57.993
to someone's phone
and a laptop

175
00:11:58.027 --> 00:12:00.443
could technically
be a 911 operator.

176
00:12:02.825 --> 00:12:06.311
How are you feeling. Amanda?

177
00:12:06.346 --> 00:12:09.142
My head hurts
like a motherfucker.

178
00:12:09.176 --> 00:12:10.902
That would be the chloroform.

179
00:12:10.937 --> 00:12:13.940
It'll pass in about
an hour or two.

180
00:12:19.186 --> 00:12:20.498
Who are you?

181
00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:22.293
And what do you want from me?

182
00:12:23.328 --> 00:12:27.056
What? Are you worried
that I'll chop you into pieces

183
00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:28.989
and put you in the freezer?

184
00:12:29.024 --> 00:12:34.132
Or lock you up in my basement
for the next 20 years?

185
00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:36.169
I'd be worried about that too.

186
00:12:38.067 --> 00:12:40.035
So. ma'am...

187
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.247
what's in Dallas that you
so badly want to get away from?

188
00:12:47.283 --> 00:12:48.906

What are you doing?

214
00:16:39.757 --> 00:16:41.103
Give me that.

Oh. look at this.

218
00:16:53.598 --> 00:16:56.463
Why would you go
and do that. Amanda?

[car horn honks]

220
00:17:10.132 --> 00:17:12.376
Now you'd better stay put now.

221
00:17:13.342 --> 00:17:15.689
And quiet. you got it?

223

-Sure!

Sure. just a little bit of...

Car trouble? Y'all need a hand?

226
00:17:28.771 --> 00:17:31.291
[kidnapper]
Nah. I'm all right. Thanks.

227
00:17:31.326 --> 00:17:34.432
It's all good.
Oh. actually. you know what?

228
00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:36.538
You wouldn't happen to have
a rope or something?

229
00:17:36.572 --> 00:17:38.298
This damn thing
won't close right.

230
00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:39.506
Hang on.

231
00:17:39.541 --> 00:17:41.336
[kidnapper] Thanks. buddy.

232
00:17:44.442 --> 00:17:46.272
Quietly.

233
00:17:51.311 --> 00:17:52.795
Will this do?

234
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.280
[kidnapper] Perfectly.

235
00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.801

Oh. nothing.

240
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.506
[kidnapper] No. no. I insist.

You got something
whacking around in there.

247

Don't worry about it.

[kidnapper. chuckles] Yeah.

252
00:18:46.539 --> 00:18:47.885

an animal trapped like that.

255
00:18:52.752 --> 00:18:54.443
[kidnapper] Amen to that.

256
00:18:54.478 --> 00:18:56.204

be good and dead
before loading them up.

258
00:18:58.516 --> 00:19:00.967
Give them a good whacking.
you know?

259
00:19:01.001 --> 00:19:02.969
[kidnapper] Thanks.
That's a good suggestion.

260
00:19:03.003 --> 00:19:04.626
I might do just that.

261
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.248

back here.

263
00:19:08.768 --> 00:19:10.977
[kidnapper]
No. thanks. I'll manage.

264
00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:13.635
Well. it's a free country.

265
00:19:14.429 --> 00:19:16.500
No! no! Please. don't leave!

266
00:19:16.534 --> 00:19:17.915
That's not an animal!

I think you're right.

268
00:19:19.503 --> 00:19:21.263
Please help me!

Are you all right there. Amanda?

I apologise for the rough ride.

We had to move quick.
and I didn't feel like

getting back on the interstate
just then.

00:22:03.045 --> 00:22:06.566
It's okay.
I understand if you're pissed.

301
00:22:06.601 --> 00:22:08.637
But I feel we should
probably talk about

302
00:22:08.672 --> 00:22:10.605
what happened back there.

reasonably believe...

I'm not really a violent man.
honestly.

307
00:22:21.754 --> 00:22:23.514
You made that necessary.

308
00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:25.516
Okay?

309
00:22:25.551 --> 00:22:27.691
Do you understand that?

310
00:22:27.725 --> 00:22:28.968
It's...

311
00:22:29.969 --> 00:22:32.143
you know. consequence.

312
00:22:32.178 --> 00:22:34.042
That's the word I'm looking for.

313
00:22:36.665 --> 00:22:37.735
Amanda?

Let's not talk about it. then.

Bygones be bygones and all that.

316
00:22:44.846 --> 00:22:47.469

you had to try. right?

Let's just be friends. okay?

321
00:22:57.479 --> 00:23:00.137
Why don't we try something
more conversational?

322
00:23:00.931 --> 00:23:03.105
You see. I'm really
dying to know

323
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.660
what the hell the deal is
with that dress.

324
00:23:05.694 --> 00:23:08.973

around dressed up like that?

325

What do you say?
Between friends?

326
00:23:13.219 --> 00:23:15.601
You're not my friend.

327
00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:17.119
[kidnapper]
How about a trade. then?

328
00:23:17.154 --> 00:23:19.743
You tell me in return
for something.

329
00:23:21.261 --> 00:23:24.679
What? You're gonna let me out?

330
00:23:24.713 --> 00:23:26.508
[kidnapper] Uh. no.

331
00:23:26.543 --> 00:23:29.028
[Amanda] Well. then you have
nothing I want.

332
00:23:29.062 --> 00:23:31.789
[kidnapper] You know.
that's not entirely true

333
00:23:31.824 --> 00:23:33.998
if you think about it.

334
00:23:34.033 --> 00:23:36.035
Nothing comes to mind.

335
00:23:37.243 --> 00:23:38.520
No?

336
00:23:39.694 --> 00:23:42.179
How about the code
for that phone of yours?

337
00:23:45.838 --> 00:23:46.908
Okay.

338
00:23:47.529 --> 00:23:49.497
-Tell me.
-[kidnapper] Now. dear.

339
00:23:49.531 --> 00:23:52.085
that's not how this works.

340
00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.087
The story first.

341
00:23:54.122 --> 00:23:55.261
Of course.

342
00:23:55.295 --> 00:23:57.746
[kidnapper] Ah. yes. Trust.

343
00:23:58.954 --> 00:24:00.508
It's a dead end. then.

344
00:24:00.542 --> 00:24:02.613
Well. I digress anyway.

345
00:24:02.648 --> 00:24:03.994
Where was I?

346
00:24:04.788 --> 00:24:06.962
Consequences. blah. blah...

347
00:24:06.997 --> 00:24:09.896
[kidnapper]
Thank you. Yes. consequence.

348
00:24:09.931 --> 00:24:12.140
Or causality. you might say.

349
00:24:12.174 --> 00:24:14.660
The fact that action
leads to reaction.

350
00:24:14.694 --> 00:24:16.213
A consequence.

351
00:24:16.247 --> 00:24:19.285
You leave the water running.
your house gets flooded.

352
00:24:19.319 --> 00:24:21.701
You use your birth year
as a password on your phone.

353
00:24:21.736 --> 00:24:23.151
and someone might guess. right?

354
00:24:23.185 --> 00:24:25.256
Or maybe you drop a plate
on the kitchen floor

355
00:24:25.291 --> 00:24:27.120
and your father locks you
in the basement

356
00:24:27.155 --> 00:24:28.605
with the lights out.

357
00:24:28.639 --> 00:24:29.675
Right?

358
00:24:30.123 --> 00:24:32.885
-Right?
-Right.

359
00:24:32.919 --> 00:24:34.749
[kidnapper]
Or maybe

360
00:24:34.783 --> 00:24:38.200
you scream and holler after
you've been told to shut up...

361
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.687
and someone gets killed.

362
00:24:45.829 --> 00:24:47.831
Or how about.

363
00:24:47.865 --> 00:24:50.005
you're a crazy psycho
who kidnaps someone

364
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.835
and then spends
the next 40 years

365
00:24:51.869 --> 00:24:54.009
getting his face fucked
in federal prison?

366
00:24:56.253 --> 00:24:58.013
[kidnapper]
That's exactly what I mean.

367
00:24:58.048 --> 00:24:59.083
You get it.

368
00:24:59.118 --> 00:25:01.189
Well. how about this last one?

369
00:25:02.121 --> 00:25:06.021
You damage someone's car
for no damn reason.

370
00:25:06.056 --> 00:25:07.885
and with no consideration at all

371
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.164
of how expensive
a trunk lock is to replace...

372
00:25:11.199 --> 00:25:14.823
What? You want to punish me
for the fucking car?

373
00:25:14.858 --> 00:25:16.584
[kidnapper]
Punishment. Yes.

374
00:25:16.618 --> 00:25:17.964
[Amanda gasps and whimpers]

375
00:25:17.999 --> 00:25:21.174
Pure manifestation
of consequence.

376
00:25:21.209 --> 00:25:22.969
The price you pay. so to speak.

377
00:25:23.798 --> 00:25:26.973
But also a deterrent from
further transgressions. right?

378
00:25:27.008 --> 00:25:29.010
[breathing heavily]

379
00:25:30.598 --> 00:25:32.116
What do you want to do to me?

380
00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.256
[kidnapper] Oh!

381
00:25:34.947 --> 00:25:36.845
Oh. I see what you're thinking.

382
00:25:38.329 --> 00:25:39.848
Penetration.

383
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.128
Any woman's worst nightmare.

384
00:25:44.163 --> 00:25:46.303
I don't know why. really.
I should think

385
00:25:46.337 --> 00:25:48.650
there'd be plenty worse things
that could happen.

386
00:25:48.685 --> 00:25:50.963
But then again. I'm no woman.

387
00:25:50.997 --> 00:25:53.793
As I was saying.
I don't really know

388
00:25:53.828 --> 00:25:56.865
if I'd have the stomach
for that sort of thing.

389
00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:02.940
But I did bring a friend who
generally likes nothing better.

390
00:26:03.803 --> 00:26:04.873
Hang on.

391
00:26:08.083 --> 00:26:09.982
[Amanda breathing heavily]

392
00:26:21.683 --> 00:26:24.168
[eerie music playing]

393
00:26:34.213 --> 00:26:37.181
Okay. here we are.

394
00:26:39.011 --> 00:26:41.013
It'll be just a moment.

395
00:26:41.047 --> 00:26:43.843
He's a little shy. Come on.

396
00:26:43.878 --> 00:26:45.914
[soft tapping]

397
00:26:45.949 --> 00:26:47.709
[legs scratching]

398
00:26:58.927 --> 00:27:00.135
[gasps]

399
00:27:01.723 --> 00:27:04.312
He's a striped bark scorpion.

400
00:27:04.346 --> 00:27:06.072
[Amanda] Oh. shit!

401
00:27:06.107 --> 00:27:08.385
[kidnapper] Endemic to our
great state of Texas here.

402
00:27:08.419 --> 00:27:10.180
Fuck! Please.
just get him out of here.

403
00:27:10.214 --> 00:27:11.768
Don't worry too much. though.

404
00:27:11.802 --> 00:27:13.355
The sting is only
occasionally fatal.

405
00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.703
unless. of course.
you have an allergic reaction.

406
00:27:15.737 --> 00:27:19.051
In which case. medical
assistance gets important.

407
00:27:19.085 --> 00:27:21.053
Very painful. though.
in any case.

408
00:27:21.087 --> 00:27:22.744
Something about neurotoxins

409
00:27:22.779 --> 00:27:26.058
that can cause paraesthesia
and muscle spasms.

410
00:27:26.092 --> 00:27:27.991
You have to love
Wikipedia. right?

411
00:27:28.025 --> 00:27:31.201
Apparently they're also
social critters.

412
00:27:31.235 --> 00:27:33.065
I'm not entirely sure
what that entails.

413
00:27:33.099 --> 00:27:34.963
but I'll leave the two of you
to find out.

414
00:27:34.998 --> 00:27:37.483
What do you want?
My story about the dress?

415
00:27:37.517 --> 00:27:39.761
[kidnapper] Well. yeah.
If you want to share.

416
00:27:39.796 --> 00:27:42.315
Okay. Yes. I do.
I do. I ran.

417
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:44.732
I ran from my own wedding.
I ran. okay?

418
00:27:44.766 --> 00:27:46.803
-[kidnapper] You ran?
-[Amanda] Yeah.

419
00:27:46.837 --> 00:27:48.321
I was there with all the guests

420
00:27:48.356 --> 00:27:50.738
and the music and the gifts
and the fucking dress!

421
00:27:50.772 --> 00:27:52.843
And I just realized
that none of it was for me.

422
00:27:52.878 --> 00:27:55.363
It was all for my dad
and his friends! So I just ran.

423
00:27:55.397 --> 00:27:57.227
You couldn't have just not
gotten married?

424
00:27:57.261 --> 00:27:58.849
[Amanda] No!

425
00:27:58.884 --> 00:28:00.299
[kidnapper] Why the drama
and the one-way rental?

426
00:28:00.333 --> 00:28:03.095
Too late when you're already
cutting the cake!

427
00:28:03.992 --> 00:28:05.856
And you don't
understand my father.

428
00:28:05.891 --> 00:28:07.755
I could've never faced him.

429
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:09.239
So I just snapped!

430
00:28:09.273 --> 00:28:12.760
I ran out. got into a car
and started driving.

431
00:28:12.794 --> 00:28:16.108
That's why the one-way rental.
That's the story!

432
00:28:16.142 --> 00:28:18.766
[kidnapper]
Why. thank you so much. Amanda.

433
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.457
That was very enlightening.

434
00:28:20.491 --> 00:28:23.909
Okay. now just get this
silverback scorpion out of here!

435
00:28:23.943 --> 00:28:26.808
[kidnapper. laughing]
Striped bark. not silverback.

436
00:28:26.843 --> 00:28:29.431
A silverback would be
a male gorilla.

437
00:28:29.466 --> 00:28:32.400
I would've noticed a large ape
in the trunk of the car.

438
00:28:33.366 --> 00:28:35.230
Although. come to think of it.
I suppose--

439
00:28:35.265 --> 00:28:36.818
Whatever!

440
00:28:36.853 --> 00:28:38.855
Just get him out of here!

441
00:28:38.889 --> 00:28:42.203
[kidnapper] Oh. I'm sorry.
That wasn't the deal.

442
00:28:42.859 --> 00:28:44.930
The scorpion is for the car.

443
00:28:44.964 --> 00:28:46.517
You two have fun now.

444
00:28:46.552 --> 00:28:48.243
[heavy breathing and whimpering]

445
00:28:48.278 --> 00:28:50.073
No! Please don't leave!

446
00:28:50.107 --> 00:28:51.799
[car door closes]

447
00:28:51.833 --> 00:28:53.835
[Amanda hyperventilating]

448
00:28:55.975 --> 00:28:57.390
[car door opens]

449
00:28:59.496 --> 00:29:01.015
[car door closes]

450
00:29:08.919 --> 00:29:10.334
[car engine starts]

451
00:29:12.095 --> 00:29:13.855
[gear stick shifts]

452
00:29:14.511 --> 00:29:15.892
[engine revs. car drives]

453
00:29:15.926 --> 00:29:17.031
[gasps]

454
00:29:25.108 --> 00:29:27.075
[eerie music playing]

455
00:29:36.257 --> 00:29:38.155
[breathing heavily]

456
00:29:41.849 --> 00:29:43.574
[intense music playing]

457
00:30:20.197 --> 00:30:21.233
[sharp thud]

458
00:30:29.103 --> 00:30:30.242
[moans]

459
00:30:30.276 --> 00:30:32.347
[suspenseful music playing]

460
00:30:54.714 --> 00:30:56.924
[phone line rings]

461
00:30:59.996 --> 00:31:01.687
[kidnapper]
911 emergency. what is your--

462
00:31:01.721 --> 00:31:04.483
-Fuck you!
-Oh. it's you! How are you?

463
00:31:04.517 --> 00:31:06.347
My friend isn't bugging you.
I trust.

464
00:31:06.381 --> 00:31:08.521
What the fuck was that.
you sick bastard?

465
00:31:08.556 --> 00:31:11.593
I thought I was pretty clear
on that subject.

466
00:31:11.628 --> 00:31:13.250
Nothing is clear about you.

467
00:31:13.285 --> 00:31:15.114
What the fuck
did I ever do to you?

468
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:17.703
You mean. besides damaging
this vehicle

469
00:31:17.737 --> 00:31:19.394
for no good reason at all.

470
00:31:19.429 --> 00:31:21.362
Yeah. besides that.

471
00:31:21.396 --> 00:31:23.536
Oh. well.
I suppose it's only natural

472
00:31:23.571 --> 00:31:26.194
that you'd think
this is all about you.

473
00:31:26.712 --> 00:31:29.025
Oh. It's not about me?

474
00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:30.612
Hmm.

475
00:31:30.647 --> 00:31:32.545
Well. let me tell you a story.

476
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.478
[laughs] Oh. God!

477
00:31:34.513 --> 00:31:37.240
Once upon a time
there was this little--

478
00:31:37.274 --> 00:31:39.483
-Seriously?
-Amanda!

479
00:31:39.518 --> 00:31:43.315
Once upon a time
there was a little family.

480
00:31:43.349 --> 00:31:46.249
Mom. and Dad.
and even a little kid.

481
00:31:46.766 --> 00:31:50.563
But of course. a little family
needs a little house.

482
00:31:50.598 --> 00:31:52.703
So Mom and Dad
went to the bank.

483
00:31:52.738 --> 00:31:57.156
who were just the nicest people
and helped them with that.

484
00:31:57.191 --> 00:31:59.262
They just had to sign
a bunch of papers.

485
00:31:59.296 --> 00:32:01.195
and then the little family
had a house.

486
00:32:01.229 --> 00:32:04.025
and everything was just peachy.

487
00:32:05.613 --> 00:32:09.306
But then.
one day Mom got sick.

488
00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:11.481
and she had to go
to the hospital.

489
00:32:12.171 --> 00:32:15.243
And for reasons too convoluted
to comprehend.

490
00:32:15.278 --> 00:32:18.074
her medical insurance
wouldn't pay.

491
00:32:18.108 --> 00:32:21.042
And Dad had to spend
all his time

492
00:32:21.077 --> 00:32:23.113
haggling with fucking lawyers

493
00:32:23.148 --> 00:32:25.219
and agents and officials
on the phone.

494
00:32:25.253 --> 00:32:27.635
So. eventually.
he lost his job.

495
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:30.603
Of course.
Mom ended up dying anyway.

496
00:32:30.638 --> 00:32:33.261
And there. right
at the very end of our story.

497
00:32:33.296 --> 00:32:35.539
is when the bank
swooped back in.

498
00:32:35.574 --> 00:32:38.094
All those papers
Mom and Dad had signed.

499
00:32:38.128 --> 00:32:39.716
turns out they basically said.

500
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:42.512
"Don't worry.
If your life falls apart.

501
00:32:42.546 --> 00:32:44.548
we'll come for the pieces."

502
00:32:44.583 --> 00:32:46.792
You feel
you got bad counselling?

503
00:32:46.826 --> 00:32:49.001
[laughs]
Oh. counselling!

504
00:32:49.036 --> 00:32:51.314
Amanda. you gotta love
that word.

505
00:32:51.348 --> 00:32:54.110
You buy a used car
from the guy down the street.

506
00:32:54.144 --> 00:32:56.422
you don't call him
a counsellor.

507
00:32:56.457 --> 00:32:58.252
But in banks.

508
00:32:58.286 --> 00:33:00.737
the salesmen are trained
to act like your friend

509
00:33:00.771 --> 00:33:03.740
while they peddle
their bullshit.

510
00:33:03.774 --> 00:33:07.778
Anyway. Mom was dead.
Dad had gone to pieces.

511
00:33:07.813 --> 00:33:11.230
and the kid was growing up.
so he left home.

512
00:33:11.265 --> 00:33:15.027
And Dad suddenly had lots
of time on his hands

513
00:33:15.062 --> 00:33:18.134
to not have a family.
not have a home.

514
00:33:18.168 --> 00:33:20.757
not have a job
or a cent to his name.

515
00:33:20.791 --> 00:33:22.828
Happily ever after.

516
00:33:22.862 --> 00:33:24.278
The end.

517
00:33:24.312 --> 00:33:27.281
I'm sorry.
But how is that my fault?

518
00:33:27.315 --> 00:33:29.317
I don't even do counselling!

519
00:33:29.352 --> 00:33:31.423
It's not. of course.

520
00:33:31.457 --> 00:33:33.701
I just thought it was
an interesting story.

521
00:33:35.737 --> 00:33:37.325
So. what is it you want?

522
00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.775
Money?

523
00:33:38.809 --> 00:33:41.433
You think my daddy's gonna
pay you to let me out?

524
00:33:42.227 --> 00:33:44.643
Is that really
so inconceivable?

525
00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.164
We'll see. I'm sure.

526
00:33:48.198 --> 00:33:49.855
The night is young.

527
00:33:49.889 --> 00:33:52.616
But you'll be wanting
that code now. I imagine.

528
00:33:53.341 --> 00:33:56.068
-What?
-The pin.

529
00:33:56.103 --> 00:33:58.726
That was the deal. wasn't it?
The code for the story.

530
00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.591
Although. I gotta say. the
delivery could've used some--

531
00:34:01.625 --> 00:34:03.696
Of course I want it.
Give it to me.

532
00:34:03.731 --> 00:34:07.114
All right. Do you have
something to write it down?

533
00:34:07.148 --> 00:34:09.081
[laughing]
Of course you don't.

534
00:34:09.116 --> 00:34:10.772
You think you can remember?

535
00:34:11.635 --> 00:34:13.844
-Yes. I think I can remember.
-You sure?

536
00:34:13.879 --> 00:34:16.123
You only have
a limited amount of tries

537
00:34:16.157 --> 00:34:17.641
on those things. you know.
I mean. we can wait.

538
00:34:17.676 --> 00:34:19.850
-I'll remember.
-All right. then.

539
00:34:19.885 --> 00:34:21.335
You ready?

540
00:34:22.577 --> 00:34:23.716
Ready!

541
00:34:23.751 --> 00:34:25.132
Okay.

542
00:34:25.166 --> 00:34:28.168
So. the code is

543
00:34:28.204 --> 00:34:29.411
one.

544
00:34:29.446 --> 00:34:31.793
-You got that?
-Got it. One.

545
00:34:31.828 --> 00:34:33.830
Followed by two.

546
00:34:33.864 --> 00:34:35.280
-Two!
-Mm-hmm.

547
00:34:35.313 --> 00:34:37.282
[coughs]
Oh. excuse me.

548
00:34:37.315 --> 00:34:38.559
[kidnapper clears throat]

549
00:34:38.592 --> 00:34:41.181
And then it's three.

550
00:34:41.217 --> 00:34:43.253
And four!
You got that?

551
00:34:43.288 --> 00:34:45.462
[suspenseful music playing]

552
00:34:56.646 --> 00:34:58.441
[phone line rings]

553
00:34:59.269 --> 00:35:00.477
Hello. This is
Stephen Jennings.

554
00:35:00.512 --> 00:35:01.789
Hello. Daddy?

555
00:35:01.823 --> 00:35:02.893
I'm not available
at the moment.

556
00:35:02.928 --> 00:35:04.895
Please do not leave a message.

557
00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:06.552
[chime]

558
00:35:18.461 --> 00:35:20.118
[vibrates]

559
00:35:20.566 --> 00:35:22.154
[gasps] Daddy?

560
00:35:22.189 --> 00:35:23.914
[Stephen. on phone]
Amanda? Is that you?

561
00:35:23.949 --> 00:35:25.261
[sobbing] Yeah.

562
00:35:25.951 --> 00:35:27.815
Hi. Daddy.

563
00:35:27.849 --> 00:35:31.405
Where the hell are you?
Do you know what time it is?

564
00:35:31.439 --> 00:35:34.580
No. I don't.
I'm in big fucking trouble!

565
00:35:34.615 --> 00:35:35.926
[crying]

566
00:35:35.961 --> 00:35:38.964
You better believe
that you are.

567
00:35:38.998 --> 00:35:41.346
I had to send the guests home.

568
00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.968
Nobody knew
where the hell you were.

569
00:35:43.002 --> 00:35:45.522
It's a big fucking mess now.

570
00:35:45.557 --> 00:35:48.870
And Johnny's family.
you know how they get.

571
00:35:48.905 --> 00:35:50.872
I swear that mother-in-law
of yours

572
00:35:50.907 --> 00:35:53.392
was glowing in the dark.
she was that fucking pissed.

573
00:35:53.427 --> 00:35:54.911
I'm trapped in a car!

574
00:35:54.945 --> 00:35:56.326
A car?

575
00:35:56.361 --> 00:35:57.534
What car?

576
00:35:57.569 --> 00:35:59.674
I don't know. I'm in the trunk.

577
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.230
What. you lock yourself in
or something?

578
00:36:04.334 --> 00:36:06.854
No. someone took me.

579
00:36:06.888 --> 00:36:08.959
Someone what?

580
00:36:08.994 --> 00:36:11.341
Are you saying
you were kidnapped?

581
00:36:11.376 --> 00:36:12.791
Yeah.

582
00:36:12.825 --> 00:36:15.690
-By who?
-I don't know. I didn't see him.

583
00:36:15.725 --> 00:36:17.899
He must have drugged me
or something.

584
00:36:18.728 --> 00:36:20.833
He didn't do nothing to you.
did he?

585
00:36:20.868 --> 00:36:22.697
-No.
-'Cause if he did.

586
00:36:22.732 --> 00:36:24.803
I swear to Christ.
I'm gonna rip--

587
00:36:24.837 --> 00:36:28.186
-No. it's not like that.
-Okay. all right.

588
00:36:28.945 --> 00:36:30.774
Okay. did you call the cops?

589
00:36:30.809 --> 00:36:34.364
-No. I can't. I tried. but--
-Good. don't.

590
00:36:34.399 --> 00:36:36.815
This sort of thing
we gotta deal with ourselves.

591
00:36:37.712 --> 00:36:39.197
You understand?

592
00:36:39.852 --> 00:36:41.613
-Mm-hmm.
-Where are you now?

593
00:36:42.786 --> 00:36:45.410
I don't know.
I think somewhere near Houston.

594
00:36:45.444 --> 00:36:46.894
How the hell did that happen?

595
00:36:48.758 --> 00:36:50.760
How did you manage
to get kidnapped

596
00:36:50.794 --> 00:36:52.831
from your own wedding. anyway?

597
00:36:52.865 --> 00:36:54.867
There must have been
a hundred people there.

598
00:36:56.075 --> 00:36:59.493
Maybe the fact that nobody was
paying attention to me helped.

599
00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:02.220
Well. so. what happened?

600
00:37:03.669 --> 00:37:06.258
I went outside
to get some air alone.

601
00:37:06.293 --> 00:37:08.743
And the next thing I know.
I'm waking up in a trunk

602
00:37:08.778 --> 00:37:10.573
with a big fucking headache!

603
00:37:10.607 --> 00:37:12.747
-In Houston?
-Yeah.

604
00:37:14.577 --> 00:37:16.061
And that's all?

605
00:37:16.095 --> 00:37:17.511
Mm-hmm.

606
00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.584
Damn it. Manda.
you know I can tell

607
00:37:21.618 --> 00:37:22.964
when you're lying to me.

608
00:37:22.999 --> 00:37:24.276
I'm not!

609
00:37:24.311 --> 00:37:25.760
Sure you are.

610
00:37:25.795 --> 00:37:28.591
I can always tell. Always.

611
00:37:29.108 --> 00:37:31.559
You didn't go outside
to get some air. did you?

612
00:37:33.389 --> 00:37:34.942
You're smoking again!

613
00:37:38.359 --> 00:37:39.740
Yeah. Daddy.

614
00:37:39.774 --> 00:37:41.535
I was smoking. I'm sorry.

615
00:37:43.433 --> 00:37:45.332
You shouldn't lie to me.

616
00:37:45.366 --> 00:37:47.748
You're right. but can we please
talk about this later?

617
00:37:48.818 --> 00:37:50.337
Yeah. okay.

618
00:37:50.371 --> 00:37:51.890
All right. then.

619
00:37:51.924 --> 00:37:54.064
And you are in the trunk?

620
00:37:54.099 --> 00:37:55.583
What car is it?

621
00:37:55.618 --> 00:37:57.067
I don't know.

622
00:37:57.102 --> 00:37:58.655
Well. what does it look like?

623
00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:00.830
I can't tell! I'm in the trunk!

624
00:38:00.864 --> 00:38:02.107
Right. shit.

625
00:38:02.141 --> 00:38:03.350
Shit!

626
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:07.802
-When I get that little creep--
-Daddy. please focus!

627
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:10.633
But he didn't hurt you?

628
00:38:10.667 --> 00:38:11.910
No. not as such.

629
00:38:11.944 --> 00:38:13.739
As such?

630
00:38:13.774 --> 00:38:14.844
He didn't.

631
00:38:15.845 --> 00:38:17.536
Well. do you know
what he wants?

632
00:38:17.571 --> 00:38:20.470
Money. maybe. I think money.

633
00:38:21.126 --> 00:38:22.679
So you talked to him.

634
00:38:22.714 --> 00:38:23.922
Yeah. on the phone.

635
00:38:23.956 --> 00:38:25.579
But you didn't see him?

636
00:38:25.613 --> 00:38:27.581
I already told you!

637
00:38:27.615 --> 00:38:30.411
Damn it. Manda!
I need to know who this is.

638
00:38:30.446 --> 00:38:32.758
I need to know
who's messing with me.

639
00:38:32.793 --> 00:38:34.381
Who's messing with you?

640
00:38:34.415 --> 00:38:37.522
-Well. you know what I mean.
-Yeah. I know.

641
00:38:37.556 --> 00:38:39.489
Please. don't do this.

642
00:38:39.524 --> 00:38:43.113
-Do what?
-Make this about you.

643
00:38:43.148 --> 00:38:45.599
Manda. you know who I am!

644
00:38:45.633 --> 00:38:47.911
My daughter's been kidnapped
for ransom.

645
00:38:47.946 --> 00:38:49.913
How is this not about me?

646
00:38:51.087 --> 00:38:53.952
By me being the one
in the fucking trunk!

647
00:38:54.815 --> 00:38:56.472
How much money did he want?

648
00:38:56.506 --> 00:38:58.853
Why? So you can decide
whether it's a good deal or not?

649
00:38:58.888 --> 00:39:02.098
No. Because I need to know
what sort of a man I--

650
00:39:02.132 --> 00:39:03.893
we-- are dealing with.

651
00:39:03.927 --> 00:39:06.654
If he wants 10 grand.
he's an imbecile.

652
00:39:06.689 --> 00:39:09.036
If he wants a 100 million.
he's a lunatic.

653
00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:11.383
-You see my point?
-He didn't say.

654
00:39:11.418 --> 00:39:13.765
-And you didn't ask?
-No. I didn't ask.

655
00:39:14.455 --> 00:39:15.767
Look. Manda...

656
00:39:15.801 --> 00:39:17.424
You know what? Fuck this!

657
00:39:17.458 --> 00:39:20.358
I'm gonna find out
exactly how much he wants.

658
00:39:24.223 --> 00:39:26.364
[intense music swelling]

659
00:39:27.641 --> 00:39:28.883
[no audio]

660
00:39:41.827 --> 00:39:43.553
[vibrating]

661
00:39:51.561 --> 00:39:54.115
[kidnapper]
So... Manda.

662
00:39:54.875 --> 00:39:57.947
I guess you're still Daddy's
girl after all. huh?

663
00:39:57.981 --> 00:39:59.120
How do you...

664
00:39:59.845 --> 00:40:01.571
Were you listening?

665
00:40:01.606 --> 00:40:04.125
Have you seen
a Texas highway at night?

666
00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.542
What else would I be doing?

667
00:40:06.576 --> 00:40:10.511
I love the way you skirted that
whole running-away business.

668
00:40:12.755 --> 00:40:16.241
So he was right.
This is about him after all.

669
00:40:16.275 --> 00:40:19.934
Is that why you gave the code?
To make me call him?

670
00:40:19.969 --> 00:40:22.523
Why don't you just man up

671
00:40:22.558 --> 00:40:24.732
and call him yourself?

672
00:40:25.284 --> 00:40:28.218
-'Cause I like talking to you.
-Is that right?

673
00:40:28.253 --> 00:40:30.255
You lock everybody up
you want to talk to?

674
00:40:30.289 --> 00:40:33.500
Yeah. I'm a people person
that way.

675
00:40:35.916 --> 00:40:37.158
[sniffles]

676
00:40:37.883 --> 00:40:39.747
He wants to know
how much money you want.

677
00:40:39.782 --> 00:40:40.990
I heard.

678
00:40:42.992 --> 00:40:44.511
So. how much?

679
00:40:44.545 --> 00:40:46.823
Oh. I hadn't thought
about that.

680
00:40:46.858 --> 00:40:51.034
Somewhere between "imbecile"
and "lunatic." I guess.

681
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:53.036
Are you kidding me?

682
00:40:53.071 --> 00:40:54.831
What kind of kidnapper are you?

683
00:40:58.007 --> 00:41:00.665
Just tell him to bring whatever
he thinks you're worth.

684
00:41:00.699 --> 00:41:02.598
I won't quibble.

685
00:41:02.632 --> 00:41:05.186
There's a Park & Ride
out by the 105 intersection

686
00:41:05.221 --> 00:41:06.602
in Plantersville.

687
00:41:06.636 --> 00:41:08.086
He can meet us there.

688
00:41:09.018 --> 00:41:10.122
All right.

689
00:41:11.399 --> 00:41:14.230
And tell him to bring the money
in a black duffle bag.

690
00:41:14.264 --> 00:41:15.956
Non-sequential bills.

691
00:41:16.991 --> 00:41:18.959
Non-sequential bills?

692
00:41:20.236 --> 00:41:22.238
Is that a line from some movie?

693
00:41:24.827 --> 00:41:25.966
No.

694
00:41:27.899 --> 00:41:30.211
But Plantersville. got it?

695
00:41:30.246 --> 00:41:31.661
Okay.

696
00:41:42.154 --> 00:41:43.604
Who are you?

697
00:41:44.674 --> 00:41:47.332
I mean. really.

698
00:41:47.366 --> 00:41:49.921
Daddy told you
to find out my name?

699
00:41:49.955 --> 00:41:51.888
No.

700
00:41:51.923 --> 00:41:54.132
I mean. you know he did.

701
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.273
But that's not it.

702
00:41:58.274 --> 00:42:00.794
It doesn't seem like
you do this for a living.

703
00:42:00.828 --> 00:42:02.934
Nah. With the economy and all.

704
00:42:02.968 --> 00:42:05.799
the kidnapping business really
ain't what it used to be.

705
00:42:06.834 --> 00:42:07.904
Just...

706
00:42:12.806 --> 00:42:14.255
Who are you?

707
00:42:16.775 --> 00:42:19.606
That would be a mite easy.
don't you think?

708
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.885
Me just telling you like that.
You really want that?

709
00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.612
Yeah.

710
00:42:26.716 --> 00:42:28.131
I'll tell you what.

711
00:42:28.166 --> 00:42:29.926
We've got a long drive
ahead here.

712
00:42:29.961 --> 00:42:31.307
We gotta stay awake.

713
00:42:31.341 --> 00:42:33.309
Why don't we make
a game of it?

714
00:42:33.343 --> 00:42:37.140
I'll give you 10 questions
to figure it out.

715
00:42:37.175 --> 00:42:39.108
I promise to answer
truthfully. okay?

716
00:42:39.142 --> 00:42:42.007
Let's say you've got
until sunrise.

717
00:42:42.042 --> 00:42:44.907
If you get it right.
I'll let you go.

718
00:42:44.941 --> 00:42:46.874
Sound good?

719
00:42:46.909 --> 00:42:48.220
And if I don't?

720
00:42:48.255 --> 00:42:50.015
What happens at sunrise?

721
00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.156
Well. we're in Texas. Manda.

722
00:42:53.985 --> 00:42:56.021
There's no air conditioning
in the back.

723
00:42:56.056 --> 00:43:02.096
It's like those dogs
left in parked cars. right?

724
00:43:02.131 --> 00:43:05.790
When the sun comes up. Manda.
you die.

725
00:43:07.861 --> 00:43:09.932
You've got nine questions left.

726
00:43:09.966 --> 00:43:12.831
What? That wasn't a question!

727
00:43:12.866 --> 00:43:14.177
What kind of game is that?

728
00:43:14.212 --> 00:43:15.834
Well. Manda.
the answer to that

729
00:43:15.869 --> 00:43:17.802
That wasn't
a real question either.

730
00:43:17.836 --> 00:43:19.010
[phone chimes]

731
00:43:24.774 --> 00:43:26.776
[phone line rings]

732
00:43:26.811 --> 00:43:28.157
[Stephen] Yeah?

733
00:43:28.191 --> 00:43:30.124
-Okay. so I spoke to him again.
-Good.

734
00:43:30.159 --> 00:43:33.024
Did you find anything out?
Who he is. what he looks like?

735
00:43:33.058 --> 00:43:35.198
It's not like
we're face-to-face.

736
00:43:35.958 --> 00:43:36.993
What?

737
00:43:37.028 --> 00:43:39.237
Wait. Daddy. wait.

738
00:43:39.271 --> 00:43:40.376
What is it?

739
00:43:41.929 --> 00:43:44.276
Manda. don't put
the phone down.

740
00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:46.969
Manda. what are you--
Manda!

741
00:43:48.211 --> 00:43:50.213
Shit!

742
00:43:50.248 --> 00:43:51.974
Manda. what's going on?

743
00:43:52.699 --> 00:43:54.252
I spoke to him again
about the money.

744
00:43:54.286 --> 00:43:56.461
Yeah? So how much does he want?

745
00:43:56.495 --> 00:43:58.912
Well. that's the thing. He...

746
00:43:58.946 --> 00:44:01.397
What? He what?

747
00:44:01.431 --> 00:44:04.400
He wants $100.000. Daddy.
Can you get that?

748
00:44:04.434 --> 00:44:06.954
[sighs] Yeah. I guess.

749
00:44:06.989 --> 00:44:09.060
Okay. but you gotta hurry.
We only have till sunrise.

750
00:44:09.094 --> 00:44:10.958
He wants to meet in a place
called Plantersville.

751
00:44:10.993 --> 00:44:12.408
Do you know it?

752
00:44:12.442 --> 00:44:14.790
He wants to meet there
at the Park & Ride.

753
00:44:14.824 --> 00:44:17.309
Plantersville?
That's gonna be tight.

754
00:44:19.311 --> 00:44:21.141
Can we get more time?

755
00:44:22.901 --> 00:44:24.834
[Amanda] Yes!

756
00:44:24.869 --> 00:44:25.939
Manda?

757
00:44:25.973 --> 00:44:28.286
No. we can't get more time.

758
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.219
Well. can you try?

759
00:44:31.151 --> 00:44:32.462
Hang on. Daddy.

760
00:44:32.497 --> 00:44:33.981
Stop doing that!

761
00:44:37.191 --> 00:44:39.090
-Manda. are you there?
-What the hell?

762
00:44:39.124 --> 00:44:42.749
Manda! Do I even have
your full attention?

763
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:47.132
-Okay. Daddy?
-Yes?

764
00:44:47.167 --> 00:44:48.824
Listen to me.

765
00:44:48.858 --> 00:44:51.516
I'm gonna send you something.
and when you get it.

766
00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:54.726
I need you to reply to me
with. um...

767
00:44:54.761 --> 00:44:56.210
the name of our first dog. okay?

768
00:44:56.245 --> 00:44:58.005
What the hell
are you talking about?

769
00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.075
[phone beeps off]

[cell phone vibrates]

777
00:45:59.308 --> 00:46:00.378
Daddy?

778
00:46:01.241 --> 00:46:02.898
What time is it?

779
00:46:02.932 --> 00:46:04.900
[man. on phone]
It's about 4:00. Fruit Loops.

780
00:46:07.557 --> 00:46:08.973
John...

781
00:46:10.871 --> 00:46:13.080
I'm sorry. I must've dozed off.

782
00:46:13.115 --> 00:46:15.117
It's so good
to hear your voice.

783
00:46:15.151 --> 00:46:16.463
How are...

784
00:46:17.188 --> 00:46:19.328
I mean. how are you?

785
00:46:20.087 --> 00:46:22.365
I'm okay.
I mean. I'm not hurt.

786
00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.471
Good. I am...

787
00:46:24.505 --> 00:46:27.957
you know. worried.

788
00:46:27.992 --> 00:46:30.132
-Did you talk to my dad?
-Sure.

789
00:46:30.166 --> 00:46:32.962
I still don't understand it.
though. how it could happen.

790
00:46:32.997 --> 00:46:34.412
with all the guests
and everything.

791
00:46:34.446 --> 00:46:36.276
It must have been
two or three hours

792
00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.072
before anyone even started
looking for you seriously.

793
00:46:39.106 --> 00:46:40.832
That's what I figured.

794
00:46:40.867 --> 00:46:42.903
But I guess you were
long gone by then.

795
00:46:44.008 --> 00:46:46.527
[sighs] Did you get the picture?
The one of the guy?

796
00:46:46.562 --> 00:46:48.909
Sure. How the hell
did you get that?

797
00:46:48.944 --> 00:46:51.118
Long story.
But does he look familiar?

798
00:46:51.153 --> 00:46:53.431
Not really.
I woke up some of the guys.

799
00:46:53.465 --> 00:46:55.951
and they are trying to put
together a facial search.

800
00:46:55.985 --> 00:46:58.643
-You can do that?
-We can do a lot. sure. but...

801
00:46:58.677 --> 00:47:00.300
it's not the best image.

802
00:47:00.334 --> 00:47:01.888
Profiles are tricky.

803
00:47:01.922 --> 00:47:04.200
I don't suppose
you got a frontal?

804
00:47:04.925 --> 00:47:06.893
It's not like I got him
to pose for me.

805
00:47:06.927 --> 00:47:09.481
It would really help if we
could narrow our search some.

806
00:47:09.516 --> 00:47:11.449
Stephen said you spoke
to the guy?

807
00:47:11.483 --> 00:47:13.209
-Yeah.
-Jesus.

808
00:47:13.244 --> 00:47:14.659
How much did you talk?

809
00:47:14.693 --> 00:47:16.385
We had a nice. long chat.

810
00:47:16.419 --> 00:47:19.664
-He say anything?
-Shutting him up is the trick.

811
00:47:19.698 --> 00:47:21.459
Anything we can use?

812
00:47:22.391 --> 00:47:23.910
I don't know.

813
00:47:23.944 --> 00:47:25.601
He might have been
a customer at the bank.

814
00:47:25.635 --> 00:47:28.328
What? Stephen's bank?
First Capital?

815
00:47:28.362 --> 00:47:29.950
We can get those records.

816
00:47:29.985 --> 00:47:32.332
Or it might have been bullshit.
I don't know.

817
00:47:32.366 --> 00:47:35.507
How about an accent?
Can you hear where he's from?

818
00:47:35.542 --> 00:47:38.303
Not really. He sounds like
he could be from anywhere.

819
00:47:38.338 --> 00:47:41.203
And he likes using big words
like "penetration."

820
00:47:41.237 --> 00:47:43.481
-What?
-No. no. not like that!

821
00:47:43.515 --> 00:47:46.035
It's just that he likes
the sound of his own voice.

822
00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:47.485
But Jesus.

823
00:47:47.519 --> 00:47:50.005
Can you even breathe in there
or move?

824
00:47:50.729 --> 00:47:53.042
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
I should've never--

825
00:47:53.077 --> 00:47:54.250
John!

826
00:47:55.493 --> 00:47:57.909
If you... when you get back.

827
00:47:57.944 --> 00:48:00.153
I'm never letting you
out of my sight again!

828
00:48:02.983 --> 00:48:04.674
I'm sorry. Fruit Loops.

829
00:48:04.709 --> 00:48:07.298
It's okay. It' s okay
I'll be all right.

830
00:48:08.092 --> 00:48:09.265
Sorry.

831
00:48:14.098 --> 00:48:15.616
Listen. John.

832
00:48:16.514 --> 00:48:19.137
I really need to get his name.

833
00:48:19.172 --> 00:48:21.657
That's really important.
his name.

834
00:48:22.623 --> 00:48:24.660
Sure. I'll get it.

835
00:48:24.694 --> 00:48:25.903
Good.

836
00:48:26.593 --> 00:48:27.905
Thank you.

837
00:48:32.426 --> 00:48:34.428
I gotta go now. okay?

838
00:48:34.463 --> 00:48:35.602
Go where?

839
00:48:38.191 --> 00:48:39.468
I just...

840
00:48:42.678 --> 00:48:44.266
I'll talk to you soon. okay?

841
00:48:45.198 --> 00:48:46.371
Sure!

842
00:48:47.407 --> 00:48:48.546
Fruit Loops?

843
00:48:51.583 --> 00:48:52.999
Yeah?

844
00:48:54.448 --> 00:48:56.105
I love you.

845
00:49:01.593 --> 00:49:03.181
Love you too.

Hello. Fruit Loops.

848
00:49:36.318 --> 00:49:38.044
How are you?

849
00:49:38.078 --> 00:49:39.424
Just peachy.

850
00:49:42.772 --> 00:49:44.809
Oh. you thought
I was gonna ask you back

851
00:49:44.843 --> 00:49:46.535
and waste one of my questions.

852
00:49:46.569 --> 00:49:49.572
I had to try. You understand.

853
00:49:49.607 --> 00:49:50.780
You're an asshole.

854
00:49:50.815 --> 00:49:52.196
I know!

855
00:49:53.645 --> 00:49:55.716
Nice trick with the pipe.
I didn't see that one coming.

856
00:49:56.683 --> 00:49:59.030
So. John...

857
00:49:59.582 --> 00:50:01.688
Sounds like a nice guy.

858
00:50:01.722 --> 00:50:02.792
He is.

859
00:50:03.621 --> 00:50:05.381
He's gonna search for my face?

860
00:50:05.416 --> 00:50:08.108
He a Navy SEAL or something?
Working for the NSA?

861
00:50:08.867 --> 00:50:11.525
Credit assessment. actually.
Just downstairs from me.

862
00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.183
Well. he sounds like
a real keeper.

863
00:50:15.184 --> 00:50:17.497
If girls are dumping that kind
of quality at the altar.

864
00:50:17.531 --> 00:50:20.327
I'm not sure what'll become
of the rest of us.

865
00:50:20.362 --> 00:50:21.639
There's always kidnapping.

867
00:50:25.781 --> 00:50:28.335
So I think I would like to use
some of my questions now.

868
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.062
Oh. awesome! Let's play.

869
00:50:36.585 --> 00:50:38.725
-First...
-Yeah?

870
00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:43.799
...I would like to know
what kind of car this is.

871
00:50:43.833 --> 00:50:45.145
Really?

872
00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:46.526
Most people start with.

873
00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.355
"where do you live"
or something.

874
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:49.494
Really?

875
00:50:50.185 --> 00:50:52.566
Okay. sure. It's a sedan.

876

Wow.

What do you want from me?

It's a sedan.

879
00:50:57.399 --> 00:50:59.815
Medium size. white-ish.

or something.

Excuse me?

884
00:51:09.687 --> 00:51:11.896
I haven't asked you
anything yet.

885
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:15.693
I said. "I would like to know."
That's on you.

You are by far
the funniest I've had.

889
00:51:28.292 --> 00:51:29.914
Fair enough. then.

890

Nine.

891
00:51:34.539 --> 00:51:35.609
Okay.

-No!

00:51:39.372 --> 00:51:41.477
I think you'll want to ask
this time.

894
00:51:41.512 --> 00:51:42.685
Right.

895
00:51:44.239 --> 00:51:45.757
So. where do you live?

896
00:51:45.792 --> 00:51:48.243
[laughs] Ooh!
Now we're getting somewhere!

897
00:51:48.277 --> 00:51:51.418
I live in Houston. Texas.
Outskirts.

898
00:51:52.971 --> 00:51:55.353
And where did you work
before you lost your job?

899
00:51:55.388 --> 00:51:57.390
Sunset Rental.
Only job I ever had.

900
00:51:57.424 --> 00:51:59.564
My rental company? The
one where I got the car from?

901
00:51:59.599 --> 00:52:01.256
The very same.

902
00:52:03.982 --> 00:52:05.639
How did you kidnap me?

903
00:52:05.674 --> 00:52:08.297
In the basement.
after you brought back the car.

904
00:52:08.332 --> 00:52:10.334
Drugged you
with chloroform on a cloth.

905
00:52:10.368 --> 00:52:12.301
then dragged you
into the trunk.

906
00:52:12.853 --> 00:52:14.752
But the basement
has private access.

907
00:52:14.786 --> 00:52:18.169
You'd still have to be working
for the company to get in.

908
00:52:18.204 --> 00:52:20.344
-Is that a question?
-No. hang on.

909
00:52:21.966 --> 00:52:25.556
You said you lost your job.

910
00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:28.455
and that's why
you needed the money.

911
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:30.250
Because you lost everything.

912
00:52:30.733 --> 00:52:31.872
Mm-hmm.

913
00:52:32.632 --> 00:52:34.358
You promised
you would tell the truth.

914
00:52:34.392 --> 00:52:37.361
Sure. When we started the game.

915
00:52:37.395 --> 00:52:39.604
I said that other stuff
before that.

916
00:52:40.985 --> 00:52:42.745
Five questions.

917
00:52:44.782 --> 00:52:45.817
So...

918
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:50.788
Your wife. your kids.
your house. that was all a lie?

919
00:52:50.822 --> 00:52:53.687
Uh. I prefer to call it
a parable.

920
00:52:53.722 --> 00:52:57.760
I felt that it conveyed truth.
you know?

921
00:52:57.795 --> 00:52:59.969
I prefer to call it bullshit!

922
00:53:00.004 --> 00:53:03.214
That's between you
and the bulls.

923
00:53:03.249 --> 00:53:04.698
Four questions left.

924
00:53:06.562 --> 00:53:07.805
So...

925
00:53:11.671 --> 00:53:13.397
So. you didn't know who...

926
00:53:17.642 --> 00:53:18.781
Why me?

927
00:53:19.679 --> 00:53:21.336
Honestly?

928
00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:22.820
The dress.

929
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:25.443
Who the hell brings back
a rental car

930
00:53:25.478 --> 00:53:28.446
in their wedding whites.
and alone?

931
00:53:28.895 --> 00:53:30.931
I just had to know. you know?

932
00:53:30.966 --> 00:53:34.003
And also. you're pretty short.
I don't do tall people.

933
00:53:34.038 --> 00:53:36.799
It's just not practical
with a modern-sized trunk.

934
00:53:38.594 --> 00:53:39.871
So. um...

935
00:53:41.804 --> 00:53:44.290
Are we even going
to Plantersville?

936
00:53:46.775 --> 00:53:48.811
No. Manda. I don't think so.

937
00:53:53.333 --> 00:53:55.887
[police siren wailing distantly]

938
00:53:55.922 --> 00:53:57.579
Oh. hell!

939
00:53:57.613 --> 00:54:00.029
-[tyres crunching gravel]
-[turn signal clicking]

940
00:54:00.064 --> 00:54:02.273
[police siren nearing]

941
00:54:03.895 --> 00:54:05.449
[gear stick shifts]

942
00:54:05.483 --> 00:54:07.520
[kidnapper]
You keep quiet back there.

943
00:54:07.554 --> 00:54:08.900
I'm not kidding!

944
00:54:08.935 --> 00:54:10.419
I'm not laughing.

945
00:54:10.454 --> 00:54:12.490
[kidnapper]
I'm serious. Amanda.

946
00:54:12.525 --> 00:54:14.975
You already have one life
on your conscience.

947
00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:16.667
[sound of gun racking]

948
00:54:16.701 --> 00:54:17.944
You hear me?

949
00:54:55.671 --> 00:54:57.086
[female officer]
Open up. please.

950
00:54:57.121 --> 00:54:58.847
[power window whirs down]

951
00:54:58.881 --> 00:55:01.505
Turn off the engine.
please. sir.

952
00:55:01.539 --> 00:55:02.851
[car engine turns off]

953
00:55:03.541 --> 00:55:06.475
[kidnapper] Sure.
What seems to be the problem?

954
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:08.753
[female officer]
You have a broken taillight.

955
00:55:08.788 --> 00:55:11.618
[kidnapper] Oh. really?
That happens in real life?

956
00:55:11.653 --> 00:55:14.759
[female officer] Sure does.
License and registration?

957
00:55:14.794 --> 00:55:16.692
[kidnapper] Yep. there you go.

958
00:55:17.762 --> 00:55:18.901
[female officer] Actually...

959
00:55:20.247 --> 00:55:23.009
Your whole tailgate looks like
you might have run over a deer.

960
00:55:23.043 --> 00:55:24.355
ass first.

961
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:25.943
[kidnapper] Yeah.

962
00:55:25.977 --> 00:55:28.532
Yeah. I think it might have
been more like a moose.

963
00:55:28.566 --> 00:55:30.396
[officer. laughing] Right.

964
00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:32.777
The old Texan moose.
Big problem this time of year.

965
00:55:32.812 --> 00:55:34.538
[kidnapper] Yep.

966
00:55:34.572 --> 00:55:36.712
[female officer] And where
you going this evening. sir?

967
00:55:36.747 --> 00:55:38.404
[kidnapper]
I'm just headed up to Whitehall.

968
00:55:38.438 --> 00:55:39.991
[female officer] Good. that's
right around the corner.

969
00:55:40.026 --> 00:55:41.648
I can probably let you go
with a warning.

970
00:55:41.683 --> 00:55:43.443
[kidnapper] Thank you.

971
00:55:43.478 --> 00:55:45.618
[officer] But you'll need to
fix that light before moving on.

972
00:55:45.652 --> 00:55:47.585
[kidnapper] Sure thing.
That was my plan anyway.

973
00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:48.966
[female officer] Good.

974
00:55:52.176 --> 00:55:53.833
[female officer]
This seems okay. sir.

975
00:55:53.867 --> 00:55:55.800
I just need you
to pop the trunk for me.

976
00:55:55.835 --> 00:55:57.595
and you'll be on your merry way.

977
00:55:57.630 --> 00:56:00.426
[kidnapper]
Uh. is that strictly necessary?

978
00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.912
I... I just barely got it
latched down back there.

979
00:56:03.946 --> 00:56:06.121
This thing is damn near
falling to pieces.

980
00:56:09.435 --> 00:56:11.782
[female officer] Nah. all right.
Just procedure. anyway.

981
00:56:11.816 --> 00:56:13.370
[kidnapper] Thank you.

982
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:17.063
[female officer] Hey. you know.

983
00:56:17.097 --> 00:56:19.479
I grew out my tail feathers
around these parts.

984
00:56:19.514 --> 00:56:21.585
-[kidnapper] Oh. really?
-[female officer] Yeah!

985
00:56:21.619 --> 00:56:23.172
Real country girl. I am.

986
00:56:23.207 --> 00:56:25.002
[kidnapper]
Oh. you don't say.

987
00:56:25.036 --> 00:56:26.693
[female officer]
Anyway. I'm just wondering

988
00:56:26.728 --> 00:56:28.454
if we might know
some of the same people.

989
00:56:28.488 --> 00:56:31.042
Are your folks up in Whitehall?
Living there. I mean?

990
00:56:31.077 --> 00:56:32.872
[kidnapper] No. No. they aren't.

991
00:56:32.906 --> 00:56:34.114
[female officer] Oh.

992
00:56:34.149 --> 00:56:36.496
I'm-- I'm sorry.

993
00:56:36.531 --> 00:56:38.981
You mean they aren't living...

994
00:56:39.016 --> 00:56:41.121
in Whitehall?

995
00:56:41.156 --> 00:56:42.985
I thought maybe they were.
you know?

996
00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:45.816
That I'd screwed the pooch.
I can be an idiot like that.

997
00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:47.783
[kidnapper] Yeah. yeah.

998
00:56:47.818 --> 00:56:51.580
[officer] Anyway. I'm sure
you've got places to be and all.

999
00:56:51.615 --> 00:56:54.065
Have a nice evening now
and drive safe. all right?

1000
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.447
[kidnapper] Will do.
Thank you very much. ma'am.

1001
00:57:06.146 --> 00:57:07.769
[phone vibrating]

1002
00:57:09.149 --> 00:57:10.668
[grunts]

1003
00:57:10.703 --> 00:57:12.463
[breathing heavily]

1004
00:57:14.672 --> 00:57:16.433
[female officer]
Someone there?

1005
00:57:18.089 --> 00:57:19.643
[car door opens]

1006
00:57:19.677 --> 00:57:22.646
Stay in the car. cowboy! Back!

1007
00:57:28.272 --> 00:57:30.792
Keeps your hands
where I can see them!

1008
00:57:30.826 --> 00:57:32.621
[thudding on boot lid]

1009
00:57:47.567 --> 00:57:48.913
[breathing heavily]

1010
00:57:49.811 --> 00:57:51.571
[thudding]

1011
00:58:07.932 --> 00:58:09.831
[whispering] I'm sorry.

1012
00:58:11.764 --> 00:58:13.075
[gunshots]

1013
00:58:16.216 --> 00:58:17.977
[car engine starts]

1014
00:58:19.254 --> 00:58:21.152
[tyres squeal]

1015
00:58:24.017 --> 00:58:26.054
[dramatic music playing]

1016
00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:35.650
[crying]

1017
00:58:35.684 --> 00:58:37.617
[cell phone vibrating]

1018
00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.588
Daddy? I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

1019
00:58:42.622 --> 00:58:44.072
[Stephen] Are you listening?

1020
00:58:44.106 --> 00:58:46.764
Are you listening.
you son of a bitch?

1021
00:58:46.799 --> 00:58:48.594
-What?
-I know who you are.

1022
00:58:48.628 --> 00:58:50.112
You bastard!

1023
00:58:50.147 --> 00:58:52.563
I have no idea
what you think you're doing.

1024
00:58:52.598 --> 00:58:55.083
but I'm here to give you
fair warning. you hear me?

1025
00:58:55.117 --> 00:58:56.947
Daddy. I don't think
he can hear you!

1026
00:58:56.981 --> 00:59:00.675
Nobody. and I mean nobody
comes after me like this!

1027
00:59:00.709 --> 00:59:03.574
You hurt my daughter.
and I swear to God

1028
00:59:03.609 --> 00:59:04.782
that you will pay!

1029
00:59:04.817 --> 00:59:06.853
-Daddy?
-I got your money here!

1030
00:59:06.888 --> 00:59:09.304
If I don't get back
what's mine. unharmed.

1031
00:59:09.338 --> 00:59:10.892
there'll be nowhere to hide.

1032
00:59:10.926 --> 00:59:12.065
Do you hear me?

1033
00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:15.103
I will find you. Mr. Bell--

1034
00:59:15.137 --> 00:59:16.656
What? Daddy!

1035
00:59:16.691 --> 00:59:18.071
-Do you have his name?
-Yeah.

1036
00:59:18.106 --> 00:59:20.177
-And if he so much--
-Daddy. say the name!

1037
00:59:20.211 --> 00:59:23.905
-It wasn't that hard to find!
-Dad. just say the name!

1038
00:59:24.422 --> 00:59:27.771
Bellerose. Michael Bellerose!

1039
00:59:27.805 --> 00:59:30.843
I'm coming for you. Manda!
Just sit tight.

1040
00:59:31.844 --> 00:59:33.742
[tyres squeal]

1041
00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:37.194
[engine turns off]

1042
00:59:38.091 --> 00:59:39.403
[car door opens]

1043
00:59:39.437 --> 00:59:41.370
[footsteps approaching]

1044
00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.028
[boot lid creaks and slams]

1045
00:59:47.445 --> 00:59:49.102
[feet grinding gravel]

1046
00:59:53.279 --> 00:59:55.971
[kidnapper] You should see
the stars out here.

1047
00:59:56.006 --> 00:59:58.042
The sun will be up soon.
they'll all be gone.

1048
00:59:58.077 --> 00:59:59.147
But right now...

1049
00:59:59.837 --> 01:00:02.081
they're pretty damn beautiful.

1050
01:00:02.875 --> 01:00:04.255
I saw them.

1051
01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:06.119
[kidnapper]
You know that thing they say

1052
01:00:06.154 --> 01:00:09.329
about the night being darkest
just before dawn?

1053
01:00:09.364 --> 01:00:10.917
What about it?

1054
01:00:10.952 --> 01:00:12.850
[kidnapper]
It's horseshit. of course.

1055
01:00:13.368 --> 01:00:15.957
The night is obviously darkest
right in the middle of it.

1056
01:00:15.991 --> 01:00:21.134
But still. these stars
are pretty damn beautiful.

1057
01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:26.899
You know what? I think we might
be in real trouble here.

1058
01:00:27.313 --> 01:00:29.867
This usually goes
a lot smoother.

1059
01:00:29.902 --> 01:00:32.870
Who the hell gets stopped for
a broken taillight in real life?

1060
01:00:34.078 --> 01:00:36.218
You've done this
a lot of times. haven't you?

1061
01:00:36.253 --> 01:00:38.117
[kidnapper] Is that a question?

1062
01:00:38.151 --> 01:00:39.739
No.

1063
01:00:39.774 --> 01:00:42.121
[kidnapper]
Anyway. you've got two left.

1064
01:00:42.155 --> 01:00:44.399
It's nearly dawn. so we got
to start thinking about

1065
01:00:44.433 --> 01:00:46.021
wrapping this up.

1066
01:00:48.368 --> 01:00:49.887
[sniffles]

1067
01:00:51.509 --> 01:00:53.857
Oh. don't cry now.

1068
01:00:53.891 --> 01:00:56.342
All good things have got to come
to an end. you know?

1069
01:00:56.376 --> 01:00:59.241
-I'm not crying.
-[kidnapper] Good.

1070
01:00:59.276 --> 01:01:00.967
So. what do you want to know?

1071
01:01:03.142 --> 01:01:04.764
Your job.

1072
01:01:04.799 --> 01:01:07.284
What exactly do you do
at the rental company?

1073
01:01:07.318 --> 01:01:09.251
-[kidnapper] What I do?
-Yeah.

1074
01:01:09.286 --> 01:01:11.806
[kidnapper]
Okay. Okay. then. I drive.

1075
01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.393
That's really all I do.

1076
01:01:13.428 --> 01:01:15.016
When people bring in a car

1077
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:16.914
that's been rented
somewhere else.

1078
01:01:16.949 --> 01:01:18.744
like Houston. in your case.

1079
01:01:19.399 --> 01:01:21.470
you pay a one-way fee.
and basically I'm the guy

1080
01:01:21.505 --> 01:01:24.128
whose time is valued at exactly
little enough to be the one

1081
01:01:24.163 --> 01:01:26.096
who takes it
all the fucking way back

1082
01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:28.374
and then catch a Greyhound home.

1083
01:01:28.408 --> 01:01:30.928
Long days. I can tell you.

1084
01:01:30.963 --> 01:01:33.172
-Yeah. that's what I thought.
-[kidnapper] What?

1085
01:01:33.206 --> 01:01:34.863
You guessed that. did you?

1086
01:01:34.898 --> 01:01:37.314
No. but I figured
it was something like that.

1087
01:01:37.935 --> 01:01:39.799
[kidnapper]
You've got one question left.

1088
01:01:44.942 --> 01:01:46.944
No. I don't want it.

1089
01:01:46.979 --> 01:01:48.739
[kidnapper] Seriously?

1090
01:01:48.774 --> 01:01:51.949
You're not gonna ask about
my reasons. motives and such?

1091
01:01:53.088 --> 01:01:54.089
No.

1092
01:01:55.228 --> 01:01:58.335
I'm sorry. I'm sure you had
a whole speech prepared.

1093
01:01:59.405 --> 01:02:00.786
But...

1094
01:02:02.891 --> 01:02:04.444
I already know who you are...

1095
01:02:05.342 --> 01:02:08.276
Michael Bellerose.

1096
01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:09.346
[kidnapper] I see.

1097
01:02:10.278 --> 01:02:12.004
And the "why"?

1098
01:02:14.213 --> 01:02:16.353
Well. let me tell you a story.

1099
01:02:16.387 --> 01:02:18.458
-[kidnapper] Really?
-Really.

1100
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.290
Once upon a time.

1101
01:02:23.256 --> 01:02:27.019
there was this perfect
little family.

1102
01:02:27.053 --> 01:02:31.264
A husband and a wife.
and a kid and all of that.

1103
01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:36.925
But you weren't the husband.

1104
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.513
You were the kid.

1105
01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:41.378
The kid whose mother died.
whose father gave up on him.

1106
01:02:42.275 --> 01:02:47.004
But no. Daddy didn't leave you
because he was an asshole.

1107
01:02:47.039 --> 01:02:49.351
He left because
of the rich people.

1108
01:02:49.386 --> 01:02:52.527
People who can afford
pretty dresses

1109
01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:54.184
and one-way rentals.

1110
01:02:58.291 --> 01:03:01.191
This is not about the money
for you.

1111
01:03:02.192 --> 01:03:03.469
Or my father.

1112
01:03:05.367 --> 01:03:06.437
Or even me.

1113
01:03:07.956 --> 01:03:14.273
You're just an angry.
lonely man...

1114
01:03:14.307 --> 01:03:16.137
who takes it out
on innocent people

1115
01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:18.208
on long. boring rides.

1116
01:03:23.282 --> 01:03:26.009
It's actually kind of tragic.

1117
01:03:28.943 --> 01:03:30.254
Except...

1118
01:03:31.497 --> 01:03:33.568
you're still a murderer!

1119
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.816
[sniffles]

1120
01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.199
[exhales softly]

1121
01:03:46.684 --> 01:03:48.479
I got it right. didn't I?

1122
01:03:49.687 --> 01:03:53.070
[kidnapper]
That's pretty spot-on. actually.

1123
01:03:53.105 --> 01:03:55.107
And great delivery too.

1124
01:03:56.384 --> 01:04:00.146
I would've let you go. honestly.
I am a man of my word.

1125
01:04:00.181 --> 01:04:01.320
"Would've"?

1126
01:04:02.424 --> 01:04:05.117
Except you got my name wrong.

1127
01:04:05.151 --> 01:04:08.258
-Your name?
-[kidnapper] Michael Bellerose.

1128
01:04:08.292 --> 01:04:10.570
That's what you get
if you just look for my headshot

1129
01:04:10.605 --> 01:04:12.262
on the company website.

1130
01:04:13.194 --> 01:04:15.541
I'm a little disappointed.
actually.

1131
01:04:15.575 --> 01:04:17.646
You really thought
I was that stupid?

1132
01:04:17.681 --> 01:04:21.098
I mean. it's not much of a cover
if you use your real name.

1133
01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.239
How could I have known that?

1134
01:04:24.274 --> 01:04:26.241
[kidnapper]
You couldn't. that's the idea.

1135
01:04:29.693 --> 01:04:31.453
So I never had a chance?

1136
01:04:31.488 --> 01:04:33.593
[kidnapper] I never said
your odds were great.

1137
01:04:35.595 --> 01:04:38.702
Also. you might have shown a
little more respect for my dad.

1138
01:04:38.736 --> 01:04:40.980
-Come on!
-He got screwed pretty bad.

1139
01:04:41.015 --> 01:04:42.223
It wasn't all his fault.

1140
01:04:42.257 --> 01:04:44.156
Got Daddy issues?
Get in line!

1141
01:04:46.054 --> 01:04:49.713
[kidnapper] Anyway. it was
a wonderfully close call.

1142
01:04:49.747 --> 01:04:53.096
And I still get the chance
to introduce you

1143
01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:56.064
to another friend of mine.

1144
01:04:56.099 --> 01:04:58.687
I have really been
looking forward to this.

1145
01:05:03.658 --> 01:05:05.073
-[gasps]
-[hissing]

1146
01:05:08.318 --> 01:05:10.492
I guess this is probably
goodbye. then.

1147
01:05:11.493 --> 01:05:14.289
It's been a real pleasure.
truly.

1148
01:05:15.704 --> 01:05:16.982
[rattling]

1149
01:05:17.016 --> 01:05:19.087
What? Nothing?

1150
01:05:19.122 --> 01:05:20.951
After all this time?

1151
01:05:23.022 --> 01:05:25.749
Go to hell.

1152
01:05:25.783 --> 01:05:27.199
[kidnapper] Right.

1153
01:05:27.233 --> 01:05:29.511
Well. enjoy now.

1154
01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:33.308
[rhythmic thudding]

1155
01:05:36.001 --> 01:05:37.450
[rattling]

1156
01:05:39.659 --> 01:05:41.627
[helicopter propellers
thrumming]

1157
01:05:43.732 --> 01:05:45.320
[hissing]

1158
01:05:46.321 --> 01:05:48.979
What the hell?

1159
01:05:49.014 --> 01:05:50.601
[Stephen] Remain in your car!

1160
01:05:50.636 --> 01:05:52.949
This is your only warning!

1161
01:05:53.535 --> 01:05:56.331
[kidnapper] Wow. Manda!
Who the hell did you call?

1162
01:05:56.366 --> 01:05:58.747
-That would be my daddy.
-[kidnapper] Isn't he a banker?

1163
01:05:58.782 --> 01:06:01.681
He owns the bank! Who the fuck
did you think you kidnapped?

1164
01:06:01.716 --> 01:06:04.615
[kidnapper] Oh. we're definitely
in trouble now!

1165
01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:06.134
Yeah!

1166
01:06:10.552 --> 01:06:12.485
[boot lid creaking]

1167
01:06:21.322 --> 01:06:24.635
[Stephen] Keep off the gas
or you will be sorry!

1168
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:26.499
[helicopter flying]

1169
01:06:32.402 --> 01:06:35.129
[ominous music playing]

1170
01:06:50.247 --> 01:06:51.766
[car door opens]

1171
01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.250
Morning. sir!

1172
01:06:54.389 --> 01:06:56.391
Please.

1173
01:06:56.426 --> 01:06:58.117
Do make yourself at home.

1174
01:06:59.084 --> 01:07:01.051
-[car door closes]
-Go to hell.

1175
01:07:01.086 --> 01:07:02.466
[chuckles]

1176
01:07:02.501 --> 01:07:04.641
You must be Daddy.

1177
01:07:04.675 --> 01:07:06.574
I hear the resemblance.

1178
01:07:06.608 --> 01:07:08.714
Where's my daughter.
you son of a bitch?

1179
01:07:08.748 --> 01:07:11.234
Oh. have no fear. she's very...

1180
01:07:11.268 --> 01:07:12.821
She's very near.

1181
01:07:13.374 --> 01:07:15.583
-Manda!
-Yeah?

1182
01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:18.689
Are you unharmed?

1183
01:07:18.724 --> 01:07:21.692
I'm okay.

1184
01:07:21.727 --> 01:07:23.660
All right. partner.

1185
01:07:23.694 --> 01:07:26.387
I'm gonna tell you
how this is gonna go.

1186
01:07:26.421 --> 01:07:29.148
-Are you listening?
-Absolutely.

1187
01:07:29.183 --> 01:07:33.083
And. might I add.
barely containing my curiosity

1188
01:07:33.118 --> 01:07:35.810
as to how this is gonna go.

1189
01:07:37.398 --> 01:07:39.883
This is $100.000.

1190
01:07:39.917 --> 01:07:42.334
Why. thank you!

1191
01:07:43.162 --> 01:07:44.750
Looking good?

1192
01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:46.821
[kidnapper] Very.

1193
01:07:46.855 --> 01:07:48.374
[Stephen] Good.

1194
01:07:48.409 --> 01:07:50.169
I hope you enjoyed it...

1195
01:07:50.687 --> 01:07:52.861
'cause you're not
getting at it.

1196
01:07:57.487 --> 01:07:58.798
I'm not sure what to say.

1197
01:07:58.833 --> 01:08:00.628
[Amanda]
Daddy. just give him the money!

1198
01:08:00.662 --> 01:08:02.802
Stay out of this. Manda.

1199
01:08:03.734 --> 01:08:07.359
Daddy. just fucking do it!
He's all about deals!

1200
01:08:07.393 --> 01:08:09.257
-[gun cocks]
-I really am.

1201
01:08:09.292 --> 01:08:11.535
Yeah. but there is no deal.

1202
01:08:13.917 --> 01:08:16.609
Don't test me. I won't hesitate.

1203
01:08:16.644 --> 01:08:17.886
Speaking of deals.

1204
01:08:17.921 --> 01:08:19.853
I have something
that might interest you.

1205
01:08:19.888 --> 01:08:21.372
Take a look...

1206
01:08:21.407 --> 01:08:22.649
[Amanda screams]

1207
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:25.618
[Stephen] Jesus!

1208
01:08:27.274 --> 01:08:29.553
[Amanda]
Daddy. why did you do that?

1209
01:08:30.761 --> 01:08:32.693
Well. the bastard had it coming.

1210
01:08:34.731 --> 01:08:36.283
What is this?

1211
01:08:36.318 --> 01:08:38.942
[Amanda]
Just let me out of here. please.

1212
01:08:38.976 --> 01:08:40.737
What the hell?

1213
01:08:48.434 --> 01:08:49.676
[Amanda] Daddy?

1214
01:08:50.919 --> 01:08:52.300
Daddy?

1215
01:08:52.335 --> 01:08:54.199
Where are you?

1216
01:08:54.233 --> 01:08:56.546
[nearby footsteps]

1217
01:09:06.003 --> 01:09:07.591
[inhales sharply]

1218
01:09:07.626 --> 01:09:10.456
[Stephen] I guess
I'm curious here. Manda.

1219
01:09:10.491 --> 01:09:12.769
Did you really not think
I would find out?

1220
01:09:12.803 --> 01:09:15.358
Are you kidding? You really want
to get into this now.

1221
01:09:15.392 --> 01:09:17.394
[Stephen] Why? This not
convenient for you?

1222
01:09:17.429 --> 01:09:19.914
Daddy. there's a fucking snake
somewhere in here!

1223
01:09:21.604 --> 01:09:23.538
[Stephen] The thing is this.

1224
01:09:23.573 --> 01:09:25.988
I know I haven't always
been around

1225
01:09:26.023 --> 01:09:28.923
after your mother died.
you know. and later.

1226
01:09:30.027 --> 01:09:32.996
But it's not like I haven't
always provided for you. right?

1227
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:35.205
Did you ever want for anything?

1228
01:09:36.758 --> 01:09:38.587
-No.
-[Stephen] No.

1229
01:09:38.621 --> 01:09:41.832
So why the hell would you go
and do something like that?

1230
01:09:41.867 --> 01:09:43.523
I don't know.

1231
01:09:43.558 --> 01:09:45.905
[Stephen] Do you know how much
I spent on that wedding?

1232
01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:48.011
And who was there?

1233
01:09:48.045 --> 01:09:50.669
And John is a good guy.
decent family.

1234
01:09:50.702 --> 01:09:52.843
Do you know
how devastated he is?

1235
01:09:53.568 --> 01:09:55.639
-You might never get him back.
-Goddamn it!

1236
01:09:55.674 --> 01:09:57.331
Are you even
listening to yourself?

1237
