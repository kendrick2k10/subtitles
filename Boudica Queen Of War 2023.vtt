3
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.727
Forward!

4
00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:54.600
Go!

5
00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:38.033
Suetonius Paulinus.

6
00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:42.741
Commander of the 14th Gemina
and the 20th Valeria Victrix!

7
00:03:51.013 --> 00:03:54.192
As Praefectus Castrorum
in charge.

8
00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:55.952
what did you have your men do?

9
00:03:55.952 --> 00:04:00.088
I advanced in triplex formation.
cohorts One to Four.

10
00:04:00.088 --> 00:04:03.432
Three and Five in support.
Auxiliary cavalry on flank.

11
00:04:04.092 --> 00:04:05.797
And...

12
00:04:05.797 --> 00:04:07.469
What did these cult leaders
of Mona do

13
00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:10.065
when they beheld
your invasion forces?

14
00:04:10.065 --> 00:04:12.100
Chanting as if
in some sort of trance.

15
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.478
Even when facing
the 14th Gemina Legion.

16
00:04:16.478 --> 00:04:20.911
these experienced Celt
fighting men... kneeled?

17
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.585
Trusting that
their religious leaders

18
00:04:24.585 --> 00:04:27.720
would offer them salvation
against your sword.

19
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.426
Yes. It appears that way. Dominus.

20
00:04:31.295 --> 00:04:32.758
You slaughtered them?

21
00:04:33.693 --> 00:04:36.465
As is my duty to Rome.

22
00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:40.733
The Celt Cucullus believe
in the Furies.

23
00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:43.098
women warriors that symbolize
vengeance and rebirth.

24
00:04:43.098 --> 00:04:45.276
They believe that
a woman warrior

25
00:04:45.276 --> 00:04:46.805
will somehow be their salvation

26
00:04:46.805 --> 00:04:49.709
and end the Roman occupation
of Britannia.

27
00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:55.143
They must not...
find their savior.

28
00:04:55.143 --> 00:04:57.288
As Augustus.
I‘ve issued a strict decree.

29
00:04:57.288 --> 00:05:00.225
forbidding women from holding
a position of influence.

30
00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:02.821
martial. judicial. or otherwise.

31
00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:06.264
We don‘t need another woman
like my mother.

32
00:05:08.596 --> 00:05:10.664
This decree must
be upheld verbatim.

33
00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:13.502
And under threat
of severe punishment.

34
00:05:13.502 --> 00:05:17.935
Especially in the tribes
of the island Britannia.

35
00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:20.707
Your Majesty.

36
00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:26.437
- Uh!

37
00:07:26.437 --> 00:07:29.000
You scared me.

38
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.202
So help me. I love you more
with each day that passes.

39
00:07:35.578 --> 00:07:37.910
I know you have made me
the luckiest man alive.

40
00:07:40.077 --> 00:07:44.389
And you. my king.

41
00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:48.822
have made me the proudest
mother. wife. and queen.

42
00:07:51.726 --> 00:07:53.794
Let me take you. right now.

43
00:07:53.794 --> 00:07:56.324
- Like old times.

44
00:07:56.324 --> 00:07:57.765
Mind’s groggy...

45
00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:00.900
Neither asleep...

46
00:08:01.769 --> 00:08:03.034
nor awake.

47
00:08:03.034 --> 00:08:05.740
Mmm... You‘re definitely awake.

48
00:08:09.271 --> 00:08:10.811
Whatever we do this morning.

49
00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:14.452
my noble. brave.
and oh-so-worthy

50
00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.179
king of the Iceni.

51
00:08:16.179 --> 00:08:17.983
we do it for
an audience of. uh.

52
00:08:17.983 --> 00:08:21.789
several servants...

53
00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:23.923
A half dozen guards. and...

54
00:08:24.825 --> 00:08:26.992
Two curious little girls.

55
00:08:28.565 --> 00:08:30.468
They‘re awake. aren‘t they?

56
00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.063
- Yeah.

57
00:08:35.902 --> 00:08:37.167
Good day my king.

58
00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:38.542
May I join you
for breakfast?

59
00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:41.138
You and the entire fort.
dear Ciaran!

60
00:08:41.138 --> 00:08:43.338
C‘mon. Make yourself at home.

61
00:08:43.338 --> 00:08:45.208
I traveled through the night

62
00:08:45.208 --> 00:08:46.880
And I’m hungry.

63
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.717
Hungry. He’s hungry!

64
00:08:48.717 --> 00:08:50.279
I’m hungry!

65
00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:54.624
I’m gonna eat your bones!
Arrrgh!

66
00:08:57.693 --> 00:08:59.563
How goes it in Camulos?

67
00:08:59.563 --> 00:09:01.323
We welcomed a new procurator.

68
00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:04.095
Catus Decianus.

69
00:09:05.063 --> 00:09:06.394
Should I be concerned?

70
00:09:06.394 --> 00:09:07.901
He‘s a Roman.

71
00:09:07.901 --> 00:09:10.068
Spoiled by Africa.
and he hates it here.

72
00:09:10.068 --> 00:09:12.807
He’ll transfer home at the
first sign of insurrection.

73
00:09:12.807 --> 00:09:13.874
Let’s hope.

74
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.011
Sorry. Ciaran.

75
00:09:19.011 --> 00:09:22.311
My offspring have the
savage blood of the Ancients

76
00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:25.314
running through their veins.

77
00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:26.623
Like their mother.

78
00:09:26.623 --> 00:09:28.086
Your "offspring"...

79
00:09:28.086 --> 00:09:29.494
is the daughter of a king.

80
00:09:29.494 --> 00:09:32.860
A very intelligent and
quick-witted daughter.

81
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.929
who will serve as a great
queen one day.

82
00:09:40.131 --> 00:09:41.539
Mornin’.

83
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.266
Ah! Latin study. girls!

84
00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:45.136
Good morning. girls.
Are we ready for class?

85
00:09:45.136 --> 00:09:46.841
Yes... Hey!

86
00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:52.374
Little savages.

87
00:09:52.374 --> 00:09:55.113
We earn money to pay
a Roman tutor

88
00:09:55.113 --> 00:09:57.786
to teach our daughters
the language of our occupier.

89
00:09:57.786 --> 00:10:01.955
so they might understand
how to navigate a future...

90
00:10:03.418 --> 00:10:04.793
A future where
their father’s rule

91
00:10:04.793 --> 00:10:06.993
will be a distant memory
of an old colony.

92
00:10:07.928 --> 00:10:09.666
Well. we must change.

93
00:10:09.666 --> 00:10:12.427
if we don’t want to be
left alone in the cold like...

94
00:10:12.427 --> 00:10:14.330
Barbarian Brigantes.

95
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.036
Well. I love my barbarian wife.

96
00:10:19.907 --> 00:10:22.272
You have king-like things
to discuss with brave Ciaran.

97
00:10:22.272 --> 00:10:25.011
my love. and I have
a cosmetics session.

98
00:10:25.011 --> 00:10:27.981
And then I’m taking
the girls to the market.

99
00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:29.785
We’ll come find you.

100
00:10:29.785 --> 00:10:31.149
Promise me you always will.

101
00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:33.019
I promise.

102
00:10:35.054 --> 00:10:36.484
Sit down. Come on.

103
00:10:36.484 --> 00:10:38.761
Eat this. No waste in here.

104
00:10:45.669 --> 00:10:48.331
We import
fashionable cosmetics

105
00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:52.005
from Germania. Gaul.
and fabled Serica.

106
00:10:53.303 --> 00:10:55.404
Some are so expensive and rare.

107
00:10:55.404 --> 00:10:59.276
the Emperor himself chokes when
he pays for his wife’s bill.

108
00:11:08.384 --> 00:11:13.664
Excess hair is not considered
fashionable at all this season.

109
00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:20.000
Rouge for the cheeks.

110
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.530
red ocher. imported from Belgium

111
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.369
and ground against mortar stone
into the finest powder.

112
00:11:28.976 --> 00:11:31.209
The color of your tunic
is so beautiful.

113
00:11:31.209 --> 00:11:32.540
Where did you find it?

114
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.717
From the Oppida.

115
00:11:33.717 --> 00:11:35.620
outside of Roman security lines.

116
00:11:36.511 --> 00:11:37.787
It was cheap there.

117
00:11:41.758 --> 00:11:43.122
Should we go?

118
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:00.271
Oh. excuse me.

119
00:12:00.271 --> 00:12:02.306
We’re looking
for the Oppida.

120
00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:03.571
Down there.

121
00:12:03.571 --> 00:12:04.748
Thank you.

122
00:12:21.358 --> 00:12:22.557
What?

123
00:12:22.557 --> 00:12:24.262
What’s the matter with you?

124
00:12:24.262 --> 00:12:25.670
We should not go there.

125
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.705
This is not a place for you.

126
00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:28.739
We’re safe.

127
00:12:28.739 --> 00:12:30.466
the Romans are everywhere!

128
00:12:30.466 --> 00:12:32.435
Look what they do to thieves.

129
00:12:32.435 --> 00:12:34.646
These are not criminals.
they’re Christians.

130
00:12:35.372 --> 00:12:36.538
Oh.

131
00:12:36.538 --> 00:12:38.243
Christians don’t mix well

132
00:12:38.243 --> 00:12:40.542
with other religions.
so the Romans crucify them.

133
00:12:41.444 --> 00:12:43.611
We should go back.

134
00:12:43.611 --> 00:12:45.316
I’ll buy a bolt
of that material.

135
00:12:45.316 --> 00:12:47.483
then we can hurry back.
All right?

136
00:12:48.187 --> 00:12:49.287
Come on.

137
00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:07.272
Ah. yes.
What other colors do you have?

138
00:13:10.407 --> 00:13:12.981
Nodens.
god of dogs and hunting.

139
00:13:12.981 --> 00:13:14.818
forbidden
by Emperor Claudius.

140
00:13:14.818 --> 00:13:17.920
one
of the divine personifications

141
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.218
in the Imperial Cult.

142
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.288
The gods only granted man

143
00:13:23.288 --> 00:13:25.961
the gifts of intelligence.
virtue. and fidelity.

144
00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:27.490
Some fresh fruit?

145
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.261
If the Imperial Cult
was so virtuous.

146
00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:30.768
why did they murder
all the Druids?

147
00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:32.869
Hey!
Change the subject please.

148
00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:39.502
Look.
Trinovante warriors.

149
00:14:01.557 --> 00:14:03.691
Boudica.

150
00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:07.266
Stop that talk!

151
00:14:10.335 --> 00:14:11.600
This is Boudica.

152
00:14:20.279 --> 00:14:21.852
Why are they kneeling?

153
00:14:21.852 --> 00:14:23.711
And what does Boudica mean?

154
00:14:23.711 --> 00:14:25.317
She was a Trinovante queen.

155
00:14:25.988 --> 00:14:27.649
Mother’s an Iceni queen?

156
00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:28.892
Your mother’s a Trinovante

157
00:14:28.892 --> 00:14:30.795
who became an Iceni queen.

158
00:14:30.795 --> 00:14:32.797
To these people.
that marks her

159
00:14:32.797 --> 00:14:34.458
more powerful than
the Roman Emperor.

160
00:14:35.558 --> 00:14:37.131
She’s like a god to them!

161
00:14:39.529 --> 00:14:42.202
Did your slave just speak ill
of the Emperor?

162
00:14:43.566 --> 00:14:45.106
She meant nothing by it.

163
00:14:45.106 --> 00:14:47.735
She’s a servant.
not a slave.

164
00:14:47.735 --> 00:14:50.947
Are you something special
to these joke barbarians?

165
00:14:50.947 --> 00:14:54.049
Vagrants who get fat
on Roman tributes.

166
00:14:54.049 --> 00:14:56.480
It appears you know
more than I. sir.

167
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.416
I don’t know who they are.

168
00:14:58.416 --> 00:15:00.187
Come along. children.

169
00:15:00.187 --> 00:15:02.090
Your slave made
a disparaging remark

170
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.553
about the Emperor.

171
00:15:03.553 --> 00:15:04.686
I’m sorry.

172
00:15:04.686 --> 00:15:06.457
A queen can afford some wine.

173
00:15:07.029 --> 00:15:09.460
Or the Roman auxiliary

174
00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.034
can hear about your slave’s
rebellious nature.

175
00:15:12.034 --> 00:15:14.234
You’ve really gone too far now!

176
00:15:14.234 --> 00:15:15.873
We have to find your father!

177
00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:18.700
You’re not going anywhere!
Find a legionarius!

178
00:15:23.815 --> 00:15:24.981
Aaargh!

179
00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.560
Go!

180
00:15:50.633 --> 00:15:52.668
Do you want
to know what I did today?

181
00:15:53.603 --> 00:15:56.848
I stood in front of
a room full of centurions

182
00:15:56.848 --> 00:15:59.180
and had to swear that my wife

183
00:15:59.884 --> 00:16:03.448
was a civil and gentle soul.

184
00:16:03.448 --> 00:16:04.889
A wonderful mother.

185
00:16:04.889 --> 00:16:08.585
who just simply loves to weave.

186
00:16:08.585 --> 00:16:12.754
I said and did
nothing to provoke them.

187
00:16:12.754 --> 00:16:13.821
I promise.

188
00:16:18.969 --> 00:16:21.763
I negotiated
and bargained more today.

189
00:16:21.763 --> 00:16:24.172
and with more passion.
than I’ve had to do in years.

190
00:16:26.603 --> 00:16:28.671
It was really quite thrilling.

191
00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:29.980
However...

192
00:16:31.047 --> 00:16:32.510
I do not wish to do it again.

193
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.512
so we will send
servants into town

194
00:16:34.512 --> 00:16:36.118
next time you want
something special.

195
00:16:36.118 --> 00:16:38.252
Like a blue robe.

196
00:16:39.418 --> 00:16:41.255
At least for the
next year or so.

197
00:16:45.259 --> 00:16:47.195
Tell me. what does it mean?

198
00:16:47.855 --> 00:16:49.263
Boudica...

199
00:16:49.263 --> 00:16:50.495
Mm-hm?

200
00:16:50.495 --> 00:16:52.134
She was a Trinovante legend

201
00:16:52.134 --> 00:16:53.861
before the time
of the Druids.

202
00:16:53.861 --> 00:16:55.335
A fierce goddess.

203
00:16:55.335 --> 00:16:58.338
A proud warrior people
that were too...

204
00:16:59.372 --> 00:17:01.209
stubborn to negotiate.

205
00:17:01.209 --> 00:17:04.707
And some believe
she will come again.

206
00:17:04.707 --> 00:17:06.445
to free us from the Romans.

207
00:17:06.445 --> 00:17:07.545
Why me?

208
00:17:11.384 --> 00:17:13.056
My love.

209
00:17:13.056 --> 00:17:16.620
You and I were married
when we were young.

210
00:17:17.555 --> 00:17:19.293
You have a proud lineage.

211
00:17:21.966 --> 00:17:23.594
There’s barbarian blood

212
00:17:24.793 --> 00:17:26.003
that drives your heart.

213
00:17:27.202 --> 00:17:29.039
and they can see that.

214
00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:31.272
It’s impossible to hide
it from those people.

215
00:17:33.175 --> 00:17:34.869
Because they look at you
and they see

216
00:17:34.869 --> 00:17:36.739
what you have
achieved with your life.

217
00:17:36.739 --> 00:17:37.982
It incites them.

218
00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:40.413
Fills them full of hope.

219
00:17:40.413 --> 00:17:42.118
Is that a bad thing?

220
00:17:45.187 --> 00:17:47.992
It might scare the Romans
is all that I am saying.

221
00:17:47.992 --> 00:17:52.920
So I wish for you to stay here
and avoid town and barbarians.

222
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.889
at least for a few weeks.

223
00:17:55.857 --> 00:17:57.034
Of course.

224
00:17:57.034 --> 00:17:59.432
Of course.

225
00:18:01.236 --> 00:18:03.733
You’re gonna have
to keep me prisoner.

226
00:18:03.733 --> 00:18:04.833
Mmm.

227
00:18:05.933 --> 00:18:07.935
Ugh! Savages!

228
00:18:09.178 --> 00:18:10.806
You monsters! Aah!

229
00:18:10.806 --> 00:18:12.841
Don’t kill me!
Ha ha ha!

230
00:18:14.348 --> 00:18:16.416
Where’s the honey mead
you promised me. then?

231
00:18:17.879 --> 00:18:19.386
Then you wanted
to wash away the taste

232
00:18:19.386 --> 00:18:21.586
of that shitty Roman wine
you’ve been drinking?

233
00:18:21.586 --> 00:18:23.621
If it gets me drunk.
I’ll drink it.

234
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.198
So. finally. I’ve found my three
most fierce warriors!

235
00:18:29.198 --> 00:18:32.102
How are you boys
intimidated by our skill?

236
00:18:32.795 --> 00:18:33.928
Ugh!

237
00:18:34.896 --> 00:18:36.568
Get him!

238
00:18:36.568 --> 00:18:38.306
Oh. gotcha!

239
00:18:38.306 --> 00:18:41.903
Raargh. that’s what you get
for fighting a king!

240
00:18:43.014 --> 00:18:45.445
I’ll be back
at the Crannog. my liege.

241
00:18:45.445 --> 00:18:47.975
You can take my wild daughters
with you.

242
00:18:49.251 --> 00:18:51.814
- I want to speak with my queen.
- This way.

243
00:18:56.159 --> 00:18:57.820
What’s the matter with him?

244
00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.262
When a man fights in a war

245
00:19:00.262 --> 00:19:02.429
and loses his family.
his home.

246
00:19:02.429 --> 00:19:03.694
Ends up with nothing...

247
00:19:03.694 --> 00:19:06.796
Laughter and the sword
cease to go hand in hand.

248
00:19:06.796 --> 00:19:09.898
should’ve seen

249
00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:12.340
the way that woman
used her sword.

250
00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.309
She was...
she was so impressive.

251
00:19:14.309 --> 00:19:15.673
She attacked...

252
00:19:16.971 --> 00:19:19.578
...without hesitation.

253
00:19:22.614 --> 00:19:24.517
I’m not sure I want my daughters

254
00:19:24.517 --> 00:19:26.486
to be Trinovante Brigante. though.

255
00:19:27.685 --> 00:19:30.325
Fighting. Never trusting anyone.

256
00:19:31.689 --> 00:19:33.790
None of them
live very long lives.

257
00:19:35.462 --> 00:19:38.234
To be able
to defend oneself...

258
00:19:38.795 --> 00:19:39.895
Hm!

259
00:19:39.895 --> 00:19:42.865
Cannot be a bad thing.

260
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:44.570
You...

261
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:47.903
You clearly have
Trinovante blood in your veins.

262
00:19:49.212 --> 00:19:51.445
Use that ferocity
in a thoughtful way.

263
00:19:53.183 --> 00:19:54.580
Not in a bloodthirsty one.

264
00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.483
Mm-hmm.

265
00:19:56.483 --> 00:19:58.452
Use it to be the
best queen possible.

266
00:20:00.553 --> 00:20:01.983
Ha!

267
00:20:05.019 --> 00:20:06.229
Come get me!

268
00:20:06.229 --> 00:20:08.495
If you want to be a warrior

269
00:20:08.495 --> 00:20:09.793
a Trinovante warrior.

270
00:20:10.827 --> 00:20:12.961
- Mmm.

271
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:14.061
Then let’s go home.

272
00:20:14.831 --> 00:20:16.668
Because I have something
to give you.

273
00:20:27.008 --> 00:20:29.120
It’s not really a gift from me.

274
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.915
It’s part of the dowry
given by your father.

275
00:20:32.915 --> 00:20:35.225
when I asked for
your hand in marriage.

276
00:20:35.225 --> 00:20:37.953
At the time I didn’t really
know what to do with it.

277
00:20:37.953 --> 00:20:40.296
but recent events
have proven...

278
00:20:40.296 --> 00:20:43.629
It may well be possible
to leave your origins behind

279
00:20:45.499 --> 00:20:47.633
but I think your origins
will never leave you.

280
00:20:47.633 --> 00:20:49.030
Hmm.

281
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.207
What is it. father?

282
00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:56.774
Protected for centuries
by the ancient Druids.

283
00:20:57.709 --> 00:20:59.414
the Queen of the Furies...

284
00:21:00.382 --> 00:21:01.548
Boudica.

285
00:21:09.017 --> 00:21:13.263
Thank you. Father.
My king.

286
00:21:14.627 --> 00:21:16.464
It is said that
the ancient smiths

287
00:21:16.464 --> 00:21:19.170
used forgotten magic
from the mountain mists

288
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.095
to forge blades like this.

289
00:21:21.095 --> 00:21:22.371
If you look closely.

290
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:24.637
you’ll see how
the color changes

291
00:21:24.637 --> 00:21:25.935
with the flickering fire.

292
00:21:25.935 --> 00:21:28.575
As if the God spell
of the Earth itself

293
00:21:28.575 --> 00:21:30.137
is woven
within its bronze.

294
00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:50.333
I love it.

295
00:21:55.437 --> 00:21:57.032
Perhaps
we rest the blade for now.

296
00:22:01.102 --> 00:22:02.444
Mother!

297
00:22:07.317 --> 00:22:09.319
What are you staring at?

298
00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:10.815
I don’t know.

299
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.049
A premonition. perhaps.

300
00:22:14.049 --> 00:22:16.722
Good things. I hope?

301
00:22:39.316 --> 00:22:41.945
The Romans are here!

302
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:01.701
Legions. attention!

303
00:23:03.032 --> 00:23:05.870
Make way for our
most esteemed procurator.

304
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:07.344
Catus Decianus!

305
00:23:08.169 --> 00:23:10.105
Legion! Outward!

306
00:24:07.063 --> 00:24:09.934
My lord. this day the Iceni
welcomed you here.

307
00:24:09.934 --> 00:24:11.375
To our lands.

308
00:24:11.375 --> 00:24:13.509
Today. we pay tribute
to the Empire.

309
00:24:13.509 --> 00:24:15.709
Come. Go with us inside.

310
00:24:24.245 --> 00:24:26.115
...Iurat capillos esse.

311
00:24:27.116 --> 00:24:29.019
quos emit. suos.

312
00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:31.890
numquid illa.

313
00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.188
Paule. peierat?

314
00:24:36.829 --> 00:24:39.865
Well done! They pleased you. no?

315
00:24:41.966 --> 00:24:46.267
Dare I presume to ask
whether they have Roman tutors?

316
00:24:46.267 --> 00:24:47.543
They do.

317
00:24:47.543 --> 00:24:49.644
I knew it!
I told you. Maximus.

318
00:24:49.644 --> 00:24:52.449
I told you that they had
Roman tutors for their children.

319
00:24:52.449 --> 00:24:54.044
When I was in Africa.

320
00:24:54.044 --> 00:24:56.420
I witnessed a dancing monkey

321
00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.082
that had been taught
by a Roman tutor.

322
00:24:59.082 --> 00:25:01.117
They really are
the best in the world.

323
00:25:01.117 --> 00:25:03.020
They can teach anybody

324
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.428
the basics of culture.

325
00:25:04.428 --> 00:25:06.859
Even these barbarian children.

326
00:25:09.224 --> 00:25:12.700
How long do you intend to grace
us with your presence. my lord?

327
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.098
A year.

328
00:25:15.098 --> 00:25:16.407
Maybe two.

329
00:25:22.369 --> 00:25:24.008
We’ll leave in the morning.

330
00:25:24.008 --> 00:25:26.912
You need only feed
my small entourage

331
00:25:26.912 --> 00:25:28.375
from your supplies
for tonight.

332
00:25:28.375 --> 00:25:30.751
and. uh. my pay convoy

333
00:25:30.751 --> 00:25:32.280
on the ides of each third month.

334
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.820
en route to Fallbrook Forest.

335
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.954
Don‘t worry.
my brittunculi friend.

336
00:25:35.954 --> 00:25:38.055
We haven’t come
to clean you out.

337
00:25:38.055 --> 00:25:41.190
Well. you’re welcome to stay
as long as you wish.

338
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:44.358
It is an honor to host you.

339
00:25:44.358 --> 00:25:45.997
So. tell me. Prasutagus...

340
00:25:47.471 --> 00:25:49.363
You built this fort yourself?

341
00:25:49.363 --> 00:25:52.773
No. it is a holding
handed down within my family.

342
00:25:52.773 --> 00:25:55.402
I have merely
improved upon it. and...

343
00:25:55.402 --> 00:25:59.076
will continue to maintain
it for our next generation.

344
00:25:59.076 --> 00:26:01.848
Then your family
stole it from someone.

345
00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.620
Bought it. traded. or won it.

346
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.183
- My ancestors had a reputation

347
00:26:07.183 --> 00:26:09.988
for avoiding violence
when necessary.

348
00:26:10.923 --> 00:26:13.629
And I try to uphold
the same tradition.

349
00:26:13.629 --> 00:26:16.027
My king is the personification

350
00:26:16.027 --> 00:26:18.062
of the civilization
in this land.

351
00:26:24.541 --> 00:26:27.511
Solid. bed-rock foundation!

352
00:26:29.007 --> 00:26:31.141
Arable land that you till

353
00:26:31.141 --> 00:26:34.815
and keep fertile with manure
of the beasts that graze here.

354
00:26:34.815 --> 00:26:38.082
And. uh. soil that
does not hold damp.

355
00:26:38.082 --> 00:26:39.820
with the elevation water run-off

356
00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.448
and down-hill mitigation.

357
00:26:41.448 --> 00:26:45.386
And the view?
Well. unimpeded from all sides.

358
00:26:46.453 --> 00:26:48.059
I warrant that on a clear day

359
00:26:48.059 --> 00:26:50.633
you can see all the way
to the Watling road.

360
00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:52.965
You are correct.

361
00:26:52.965 --> 00:26:55.429
It’s no wonder that this fort

362
00:26:55.429 --> 00:26:58.806
has been so sought-after
this last millennium.

363
00:26:58.806 --> 00:27:01.138
My British king.

364
00:27:02.975 --> 00:27:05.549
We serve you well here. Lord.

365
00:27:07.144 --> 00:27:08.343
Yes.

366
00:27:08.343 --> 00:27:10.246
Yes indeed. you do.

367
00:27:16.087 --> 00:27:19.189
We’re going to have to be
very well-behaved Britons.

368
00:27:19.189 --> 00:27:22.929
This officious bastard could
royally fuck us if he chooses.

369
00:27:22.929 --> 00:27:24.799
We have to be smart about this.

370
00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:26.603
We make ourselves indispensable.

371
00:27:28.495 --> 00:27:32.972
You are--
Right. Of course.

372
00:27:32.972 --> 00:27:34.908
Now. ready the guards to leave.

373
00:27:34.908 --> 00:27:37.548
We’ll run raiding parties
for a few days.

374
00:27:37.548 --> 00:27:40.144
Round up any bandits.
cattle thieves. undesirables.

375
00:27:40.144 --> 00:27:42.410
and we’ll send those
to Catus Decianus as a tribute.

376
00:27:44.016 --> 00:27:45.655
Knowing these lands
are dangerous

377
00:27:45.655 --> 00:27:48.559
might temper his desires
to settle here.

378
00:27:51.188 --> 00:27:53.729
You’re a wise man. my lord.

379
00:27:53.729 --> 00:27:55.896
I’ll ride with the party.

380
00:27:55.896 --> 00:27:57.491
Exercise will do me good.

381
00:28:08.469 --> 00:28:10.680
I have such a thirst
for you. woman!

382
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.981
A dryness in my soul
that only you can quench.

383
00:28:14.981 --> 00:28:16.444
Mother. Father!

384
00:28:16.444 --> 00:28:18.314
Oh. school is over?

385
00:28:18.314 --> 00:28:19.689
Yes.

386
00:28:19.689 --> 00:28:20.921
I need to take
a good look at you.

387
00:28:20.921 --> 00:28:23.187
Now you need to promise me

388
00:28:23.187 --> 00:28:25.387
that you will always stay
by your mother’s side.

389
00:28:26.487 --> 00:28:27.554
Promise?

390
00:28:27.554 --> 00:28:28.731
Promise.

391
00:28:28.731 --> 00:28:30.964
All three of you. stay warm.

392
00:28:31.965 --> 00:28:33.065
I promise.

393
00:28:35.331 --> 00:28:37.674
And I need you to know
that I love you.

394
00:28:38.642 --> 00:28:40.072
And I always will.

395
00:28:45.044 --> 00:28:46.243
I love you too.

396
00:29:53.442 --> 00:29:56.016
The men are back!
Close the gate!

397
00:30:32.481 --> 00:30:33.680
Aaargh!

398
00:31:15.832 --> 00:31:18.032
Long live the
Queen of the Iceni.

399
00:32:58.968 --> 00:33:01.696
All hail Caesar Augustus Nero!

400
00:33:03.973 --> 00:33:05.942
Hail. Catus Decianus.

401
00:33:07.108 --> 00:33:08.307
Please join us.

402
00:33:08.307 --> 00:33:10.111
I shall not stay...

403
00:33:10.111 --> 00:33:11.981
I feel my presence

404
00:33:11.981 --> 00:33:15.611
weighs heavily on the mood
of the locals.

405
00:33:17.118 --> 00:33:20.187
You read too much
into simple curiosity.

406
00:33:20.187 --> 00:33:22.057
Did you receive my tribute?

407
00:33:22.717 --> 00:33:25.456
Yes. I did.

408
00:33:25.456 --> 00:33:26.754
And I thank you.

409
00:33:27.788 --> 00:33:29.295
You have bequeathed

410
00:33:29.295 --> 00:33:32.265
half of your holdings
and lands to me.

411
00:33:33.497 --> 00:33:37.369
’Tis a most
generous acquiescence.

412
00:33:37.369 --> 00:33:39.602
I’m glad
his lordship is satisfied.

413
00:33:40.636 --> 00:33:42.209
Oh. I have not said that.

414
00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:47.643
As a woman.
Rome cannot

415
00:33:47.643 --> 00:33:52.384
and will not
recognize you as queen.

416
00:33:55.189 --> 00:33:57.928
No female is recognized
as worthy

417
00:33:58.753 --> 00:34:00.887
of any position
of governing power.

418
00:34:02.031 --> 00:34:04.660
To do so is a rebuke
against Rome.

419
00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.827
Senate. and Empire!

420
00:34:06.827 --> 00:34:09.731
And a personal indignity
to the Emperor.

421
00:34:09.731 --> 00:34:12.272
To try and bribe me

422
00:34:12.272 --> 00:34:16.540
into turning a blind eye
to this wanton ridicule.

423
00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.905
this perversion of our laws.

424
00:34:18.905 --> 00:34:20.577
is a crime!

425
00:34:20.577 --> 00:34:23.778
One that begs
to be punished to the full.

426
00:34:24.614 --> 00:34:25.956
I don’t understand you.

427
00:34:25.956 --> 00:34:27.848
Well then let me make it simple

428
00:34:27.848 --> 00:34:29.993
for your barbarian brain
to ingest...

429
00:34:29.993 --> 00:34:35.031
I shall not be taking half
of your holdings and lands.

430
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:38.364
all
of your kingdom.

431
00:34:38.364 --> 00:34:42.005
And you will be flogged.

432
00:34:42.005 --> 00:34:45.437
A fate shared by
your children.

433
00:34:45.437 --> 00:34:46.933
while you watch.

434
00:34:48.539 --> 00:34:50.112
Oh. you look to Ciaran!

435
00:34:51.146 --> 00:34:55.051
The man who told me
where you husband would be

436
00:34:55.051 --> 00:34:56.745
the day he was killed.

437
00:34:59.055 --> 00:35:03.851
Roman gold will make a convert
of the weak and covetous.

438
00:35:07.624 --> 00:35:10.759
Stand... down!

439
00:35:10.759 --> 00:35:12.134
No. please!

440
00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.676
Appointed by the Empire.

441
00:35:26.676 --> 00:35:29.547
bequeathed
by the Emperor himself.

442
00:35:30.251 --> 00:35:32.418
my word is law

443
00:35:32.418 --> 00:35:34.618
as if spoken by Nero!

444
00:35:36.059 --> 00:35:39.491
Henceforth. all land
and properties

445
00:35:39.491 --> 00:35:44.793
owned by Prasutagus of Iceni

446
00:35:44.793 --> 00:35:45.860
are mine!

447
00:35:48.467 --> 00:35:49.732
Hail Nero.

448
00:35:59.643 --> 00:36:01.249
Aaaaah!

449
00:36:08.157 --> 00:36:10.555
Don’t you dare touch her!

450
00:36:15.131 --> 00:36:17.100
Noooo! Aaaaah!

451
00:36:22.831 --> 00:36:26.406
This was a gift from Nero.

452
00:36:27.209 --> 00:36:29.277
One holds it into fire

453
00:36:30.344 --> 00:36:32.115
then pushes it onto the face

454
00:36:32.115 --> 00:36:37.010
of any misbehaving slave.
thus branding them his property.

455
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:38.220
N. R.

456
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.388
Nero Rex Dramus.

457
00:36:41.388 --> 00:36:42.818
A-Although. in your case.

458
00:36:42.818 --> 00:36:44.688
the N. R. could stand for

459
00:36:45.018 --> 00:36:46.954
Nec Regina.

460
00:36:47.691 --> 00:36:48.791
Queen no more.

461
00:36:49.858 --> 00:36:53.235
Any disruptive brittunculi

462
00:36:53.235 --> 00:36:54.698
looking to you

463
00:36:54.698 --> 00:36:57.305
will see this mark. laugh.

464
00:36:57.305 --> 00:37:00.033
and be reminded
of your falsehood.

465
00:37:06.875 --> 00:37:08.283
Ohhh...

466
00:37:10.153 --> 00:37:12.485
The illicit smell
of burning flesh.

467
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.602
Shh. shh. shh.

468
00:38:36.602 --> 00:38:38.901
Quiet. You must come with us.

469
00:39:19.579 --> 00:39:21.647
die here.

470
00:39:21.647 --> 00:39:23.583
We have to keep moving.

471
00:40:09.024 --> 00:40:12.258
Mmm... Girls?

472
00:40:15.371 --> 00:40:16.471
Girls?

473
00:40:24.072 --> 00:40:25.678
Where are my daughters?

474
00:40:27.207 --> 00:40:28.549
Where are my daughters?

475
00:40:28.549 --> 00:40:29.682
Shhh.

476
00:40:32.916 --> 00:40:34.852
Were they hurt?

477
00:40:34.852 --> 00:40:36.722
Where are my daughters?

478
00:40:39.087 --> 00:40:40.792
Woah. woah. woah.

479
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.435
Ugh! Oh. I forgot.

480
00:40:47.535 --> 00:40:48.734
Ohhh.

481
00:40:51.539 --> 00:40:53.673
I can’t understand
what happened.

482
00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:56.577
You must bring them.

483
00:40:56.577 --> 00:40:58.645
You must bring them. I...

484
00:40:58.645 --> 00:40:59.976
I want to hug them.

485
00:40:59.976 --> 00:41:02.044
- Where are my children?

486
00:41:04.651 --> 00:41:08.314
We... are your children. Boudica.

487
00:41:25.606 --> 00:41:27.410
I need to see my girls.

488
00:41:32.679 --> 00:41:35.242
- There you are. Mother!
- Mother. darling!

489
00:41:35.242 --> 00:41:37.211
Oh! Babies!

490
00:41:42.315 --> 00:41:44.394
My babies!

491
00:41:50.565 --> 00:41:51.929
I’m so sorry!

492
00:41:53.964 --> 00:41:56.604
I’m so. so sorry.

493
00:41:56.604 --> 00:41:58.903
I couldn’t protect you.

494
00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.775
You know...
I fought so hard.

495
00:42:05.415 --> 00:42:07.450
I tried everything.

496
00:42:09.045 --> 00:42:11.245
It’s all right. Mother.

497
00:42:11.245 --> 00:42:13.082
We’re here with you now.

498
00:42:20.386 --> 00:42:21.563
For your mouth.

499
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.393
- What?
- For teeth.

500
00:42:34.169 --> 00:42:36.974
She says a warrior
must be able to bite.

501
00:42:36.974 --> 00:42:40.648
She stole it from
the mouth of a dead centurion.

502
00:42:40.648 --> 00:42:42.309
Ohhh...

503
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:44.751
So happy.

504
00:42:44.751 --> 00:42:47.017
You must eat.

505
00:42:47.017 --> 00:42:49.921
She is a warrior.
And a soothsayer.

506
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.386
She says that
you are to be queen.

507
00:42:53.386 --> 00:42:56.125
That your task is
to kill the Romans.

508
00:42:57.423 --> 00:42:58.930
We are here
to help you. Mother.

509
00:43:00.503 --> 00:43:01.966
My babies.

510
00:43:03.605 --> 00:43:05.068
My babies!

511
00:43:08.335 --> 00:43:09.578
You must eat.

512
00:43:38.398 --> 00:43:39.905
What are you learning?

513
00:43:39.905 --> 00:43:42.468
We learn how
to use weapons.

514
00:43:42.468 --> 00:43:44.679
Must a Trinovante woman fight?

515
00:43:44.679 --> 00:43:47.044
A Trinovante woman
can do anything.

516
00:43:47.044 --> 00:43:48.474
Best of all. they fight.

517
00:43:50.245 --> 00:43:52.280
Can I spend some time
with you. my dears?

518
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.821
It feels like
I’ve seen nothing of you.

519
00:43:56.559 --> 00:43:57.956
Mmm...

520
00:44:02.422 --> 00:44:05.568
- I’m sorry I’ve disturbed you.
- You haven’t.

521
00:44:06.635 --> 00:44:08.835
Is there anything I can get
for you. my queen?

522
00:44:08.835 --> 00:44:11.101
I’ve got everything
I need right now.

523
00:44:11.101 --> 00:44:12.575
But thank you.

524
00:44:16.502 --> 00:44:18.504
She’s looked after you well.

525
00:44:18.504 --> 00:44:20.781
She is our friend. Mother.

526
00:44:20.781 --> 00:44:22.013
Where are her children?

527
00:44:22.013 --> 00:44:23.982
The Romans killed her children.

528
00:44:23.982 --> 00:44:26.985
She had daughters. Like us.

529
00:44:26.985 --> 00:44:29.119
These people want you
to be their queen.

530
00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:31.352
They say you’re chosen.
It’s an honor.

531
00:44:31.352 --> 00:44:33.629
Oh no. I wasn’t chosen.

532
00:44:33.629 --> 00:44:35.158
I was double-crossed
and betrayed.

533
00:44:35.158 --> 00:44:37.567
and my people
let this happen!

534
00:44:37.567 --> 00:44:39.569
No. they mean that
Catus chose you.

535
00:44:39.569 --> 00:44:41.362
When he branded you.

536
00:44:42.935 --> 00:44:44.266
No. this...

537
00:44:44.266 --> 00:44:46.873
It’s a mark of humiliation.

538
00:44:46.873 --> 00:44:49.370
To the Trinovante.
you have been anointed.

539
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.537
It is our duty
to bring the tribes together.

540
00:44:51.537 --> 00:44:54.276
To kill the Romans.

541
00:44:54.276 --> 00:44:56.652
Do you remember what
Catus ordered his men to do?

542
00:44:56.652 --> 00:44:58.346
In front of your friends.
your family?

543
00:44:58.346 --> 00:45:00.656
Oh I do. I do.
I’m sorry.

544
00:45:00.656 --> 00:45:02.922
I’m really. really sorry.

545
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:07.663
You were the Queen of Iceni.

546
00:45:07.663 --> 00:45:09.324
are
the Queen of Iceni.

547
00:45:09.324 --> 00:45:12.063
These people need you now
more than ever.

548
00:45:12.063 --> 00:45:13.801
You really have no choice.

549
00:45:22.744 --> 00:45:24.372
Wait!

550
00:45:24.372 --> 00:45:25.747
I’ll show you.

551
00:45:27.045 --> 00:45:29.982
Neck. under the arm.

552
00:45:30.983 --> 00:45:32.083
Wrist.

553
00:45:33.348 --> 00:45:34.822
Stomach will stop.

554
00:45:34.822 --> 00:45:36.384
but it won’t kill.

555
00:45:36.384 --> 00:45:39.222
This is where most
wear their armor thickest.

556
00:45:39.222 --> 00:45:42.027
Neck. under the arm.

557
00:45:42.027 --> 00:45:43.963
under the armor.

558
00:45:43.963 --> 00:45:45.899
These’ll be your targets.

559
00:45:45.899 --> 00:45:46.999
Show me.

560
00:45:48.462 --> 00:45:50.398
Neck!

561
00:45:50.398 --> 00:45:53.401
- Ooh! Wah!
- Yes.

562
00:45:57.504 --> 00:45:58.747
This is for you.

563
00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:14.697
Where did you get this?

564
00:46:15.896 --> 00:46:17.865
Catus gave it to a Roman.

565
00:46:17.865 --> 00:46:19.196
I killed him.

566
00:46:19.196 --> 00:46:20.868
And now it is
yours again.

567
00:46:27.237 --> 00:46:28.678
Don’t cry. Mother.

568
00:46:28.678 --> 00:46:30.141
We can’t show weakness.

569
00:46:30.141 --> 00:46:33.375
Bronze is the metal of the past.

570
00:46:33.375 --> 00:46:34.750
It won’t hold an edge.

571
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:36.312
Heavy and unwieldy.

572
00:46:36.312 --> 00:46:38.248
More dangerous to its owner
than its enemy.

573
00:46:38.248 --> 00:46:40.448
Not this blade.
Not to me.

574
00:46:40.448 --> 00:46:42.692
Who’s using
my training area?

575
00:46:50.931 --> 00:46:54.594
You’re the Iceni queen that’s
come to save us. aren’t you?

576
00:46:54.594 --> 00:46:56.167
They call her Boudica.

577
00:46:56.167 --> 00:47:00.138
- That’s a bold name.
- I did not choose it.

578
00:47:00.138 --> 00:47:02.668
I see the brand on your face.

579
00:47:02.668 --> 00:47:06.342
and I’ve. uh. seen
what a cat-of-nine-tails

580
00:47:06.342 --> 00:47:08.146
does to a man’s back.

581
00:47:08.146 --> 00:47:11.281
But how does that qualify you
to lead the Trinovante?

582
00:47:11.281 --> 00:47:14.383
Why should you be leader
and not me?

583
00:47:16.517 --> 00:47:17.925
I’m just Boudica.

584
00:47:19.487 --> 00:47:21.764
I fought as an auxiliary
for the Romans.

585
00:47:21.764 --> 00:47:23.689
So I know how they train.

586
00:47:23.689 --> 00:47:26.527
how they tool up.
how they fight.

587
00:47:26.527 --> 00:47:27.693
How they think.

588
00:47:27.693 --> 00:47:30.773
Now I’m a deserter.
marked for death.

589
00:47:30.773 --> 00:47:32.698
As are all my men!

590
00:47:32.698 --> 00:47:34.172
But I’ve returned...

591
00:47:34.172 --> 00:47:37.439
to lead my people
out of Roman bondage.

592
00:47:37.439 --> 00:47:39.375
So you’d best step aside.

593
00:47:47.988 --> 00:47:52.861
Is that what you’re going
to challenge the Romans with?

594
00:47:52.861 --> 00:47:54.555
Bronze was good.

595
00:47:54.555 --> 00:47:56.194
when that was all we had.

596
00:47:56.898 --> 00:47:58.097
Iron...

597
00:47:59.197 --> 00:48:01.199
That’s the way
of modern warfare.

598
00:48:02.563 --> 00:48:03.729
May I?

599
00:48:16.676 --> 00:48:17.985
By the gods.

600
00:48:17.985 --> 00:48:19.382
it’s ugly in the hand.

601
00:48:19.382 --> 00:48:21.989
heavy. imbalanced.

602
00:48:23.353 --> 00:48:25.091
There’s no life to it.

603
00:48:25.091 --> 00:48:26.719
That’s why we don’t use
bronze anymore.

604
00:48:26.719 --> 00:48:28.160
Let me do you a favor!

605
00:48:30.657 --> 00:48:32.263
Huh!

606
00:48:36.234 --> 00:48:37.334
What?

607
00:48:38.302 --> 00:48:41.404
What? I did you a favor!

608
00:48:41.404 --> 00:48:42.504
Where is she?

609
00:48:46.706 --> 00:48:48.213
That blade was shit.

610
00:48:48.213 --> 00:48:50.182
Any real warrior
would know that.

611
00:48:58.894 --> 00:49:00.555
There’s strong currents
in there.

612
00:49:00.555 --> 00:49:02.755
Strong enough to hold a man
down and drown him.

613
00:49:02.755 --> 00:49:06.198
Now I feel responsible.
Should I go in?

614
00:49:06.198 --> 00:49:07.364
What’s so interesting?

615
00:49:11.533 --> 00:49:14.305
Maybe this sword chooses
who it performs for.

616
00:49:14.305 --> 00:49:16.175
How did you reshape the blade?

617
00:49:16.175 --> 00:49:18.375
This is how I found it.

618
00:49:19.409 --> 00:49:21.114
This should be interesting.

619
00:49:32.059 --> 00:49:34.127
I was an archer in Armenia.

620
00:49:34.127 --> 00:49:36.360
tracker for Galba in Spain.

621
00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.032
swordsman for Rome.

622
00:49:39.825 --> 00:49:41.464
In all of my years
living by the sword

623
00:49:41.464 --> 00:49:44.071
I’ve never seen anything
like this before.

624
00:49:44.071 --> 00:49:46.238
Our people asked
the gods of the land

625
00:49:46.238 --> 00:49:47.976
to provide us a leader.

626
00:49:47.976 --> 00:49:49.373
and now they have!

627
00:49:51.837 --> 00:49:53.047
Queen Boudica...

628
00:49:55.346 --> 00:49:56.677
Kneel.

629
00:49:57.744 --> 00:49:58.844
Accept me.

630
00:49:58.844 --> 00:50:01.583
and my men.
as your loyal servants.

631
00:50:35.386 --> 00:50:38.191
I was happy being
a collaborator.

632
00:50:38.191 --> 00:50:39.390
and a wife.

633
00:50:43.361 --> 00:50:44.527
Now...

634
00:50:45.528 --> 00:50:47.233
those two girls are...

635
00:50:47.233 --> 00:50:52.073
the only trace
of the old me.

636
00:50:54.438 --> 00:50:56.143
You think I can do this?

637
00:51:01.412 --> 00:51:03.216
You’re the only one who can.

638
00:51:06.516 --> 00:51:07.649
Yeah.

639
00:51:15.723 --> 00:51:18.726
Forged
by Catuvellauni craftsmen...

640
00:51:19.595 --> 00:51:22.103
before the time
of the Trinovante

641
00:51:22.103 --> 00:51:23.500
or the Iceni.

642
00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:26.305
The symbol of your royalty...

643
00:51:28.406 --> 00:51:33.213
stolen by the invaders from Rome
and returned to you now.

644
00:51:34.874 --> 00:51:39.054
Do you choose
the royal torque. Boudica?

645
00:51:41.254 --> 00:51:42.882
Put it on.

646
00:51:42.882 --> 00:51:45.819
You must choose it.
It’s yours.

647
00:51:49.229 --> 00:51:52.430
In the name
of the four kings of Kent.

648
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:55.004
Queen Boudica!

649
00:51:55.004 --> 00:51:58.799
Boudica!

650
00:52:00.042 --> 00:52:05.146
I am Boudica.
You are my people.

651
00:52:05.146 --> 00:52:07.511
We are in a time
of extreme peril.

652
00:52:09.315 --> 00:52:12.087
We fight for our freedom!

653
00:52:12.087 --> 00:52:13.484
Yes!

654
00:52:13.484 --> 00:52:15.618
honor!
- Yes!

655
00:52:15.618 --> 00:52:17.653
The Romans fight for pay.

656
00:52:17.653 --> 00:52:19.061
We know that
the Romans are paid

657
00:52:19.061 --> 00:52:21.129
on the ides
of every third month.

658
00:52:21.129 --> 00:52:22.823
In two days’ time.

659
00:52:22.823 --> 00:52:25.100
Catus Decianus
will lead a pay convoy

660
00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.070
from Londinium to Venonis
and then to Eboracum.

661
00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:32.998
That will lead him straight
through Fallbrook Forest.

662
00:52:32.998 --> 00:52:35.077
Where we shall ambush him.

663
00:52:37.475 --> 00:52:40.907
Catus Decianus has
a centurie of 80 men.

664
00:52:42.117 --> 00:52:45.153
Batavian auxiliaries marching
with him at all times.

665
00:52:45.153 --> 00:52:47.815
along with mounted Equites
and Galician mercenaries.

666
00:52:47.815 --> 00:52:51.489
He will destroy any ambush
you set. Any ambush.

667
00:52:51.489 --> 00:52:53.425
It’s a perfect setup.

668
00:52:53.425 --> 00:52:57.330
The Romans have been plundering
our gold for 20 years!

669
00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:59.761
I think it’s time
to take it back.

670
00:52:59.761 --> 00:53:00.696
Yes!

671
00:53:00.696 --> 00:53:03.105
We must plan a war!

672
00:53:03.105 --> 00:53:06.768
Wolfgar. if you’re not
behind me in Fallbrook Forest.

673
00:53:06.768 --> 00:53:10.035
I will fight Catus alone.

674
00:53:10.035 --> 00:53:11.575
But I will fight him.

675
00:53:12.642 --> 00:53:14.875
You’re as mad
as a March hare.

676
00:53:15.744 --> 00:53:19.550
No. I’m as clear-headed
as I’ve ever been.

677
00:53:24.687 --> 00:53:28.361
I need to know
if you are with me.

678
00:53:53.045 --> 00:53:54.354
Give me my sword.

679
00:54:01.196 --> 00:54:02.758
Thank you.

680
00:54:09.567 --> 00:54:11.767
Was I the only one who saw that?

681
00:54:25.044 --> 00:54:28.190
Our world is...
full of signs.

682
00:54:31.919 --> 00:54:33.492
She must be the one.

683
00:54:39.861 --> 00:54:42.171
You don’t approve. huh?

684
00:54:44.305 --> 00:54:46.802
Your silence speaks volumes.

685
00:54:46.802 --> 00:54:49.673
You ask a lot
of a simple people.

686
00:54:51.136 --> 00:54:52.874
When opportunity
presents itself.

687
00:54:52.874 --> 00:54:54.414
we must seize it.

688
00:54:54.414 --> 00:54:57.318
And Catus in the forest
is an opportunity.

689
00:54:57.318 --> 00:54:58.880
Did I do wrong?

690
00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:01.652
You should not act
so willfully.

691
00:55:01.652 --> 00:55:04.325
They call me queen.

692
00:55:04.325 --> 00:55:06.459
And then
they question my plan.

693
00:55:07.427 --> 00:55:11.024
It’s OK. We’ll do this
on our own. girls.

694
00:55:11.024 --> 00:55:12.333
Look behind you. Mother.

695
00:55:26.776 --> 00:55:30.384
What they say about you
cannot be more true.

696
00:55:30.384 --> 00:55:32.848
We have chosen you
as our queen.

697
00:55:33.783 --> 00:55:35.048
Boudica!

698
00:55:35.048 --> 00:55:37.622
Boudica! Boudica!

699
00:56:13.218 --> 00:56:15.627
Step off the road. brittunculi.

700
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:20.731
Who the fuck
are you talking to?

701
00:56:21.633 --> 00:56:24.163
Halt!

702
00:56:25.032 --> 00:56:26.638
You. peasant...

703
00:56:37.044 --> 00:56:38.353
You were dead.

704
00:56:38.353 --> 00:56:39.717
I’m your queen.

705
00:56:39.717 --> 00:56:42.489
Or has your ambition
blinded you?

706
00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:46.086
My queen.

707
00:56:53.401 --> 00:56:56.668
I don’t know how
or why you’re here.

708
00:56:56.668 --> 00:56:58.901
but you must leave now.

709
00:56:58.901 --> 00:57:00.375
I am queen.

710
00:57:00.375 --> 00:57:02.575
and I’d like to speak
to your regent.

711
00:57:02.575 --> 00:57:04.841
Catus Decianus.

712
00:57:06.172 --> 00:57:07.877
If you don’t go now.

713
00:57:07.877 --> 00:57:10.748
he will crucify you
this time.

714
00:57:12.948 --> 00:57:14.180
Send word.

715
00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.986
The queen of the Iceni
wishes to parlay.

716
00:57:19.328 --> 00:57:20.791
If you don’t tell him.

717
00:57:20.791 --> 00:57:22.793
he’ll have you whipped
like me.

718
00:57:22.793 --> 00:57:25.092
I guarantee you that.

719
00:57:25.994 --> 00:57:27.127
Hm.

720
00:57:33.133 --> 00:57:34.673
Take a good look!

721
00:57:35.872 --> 00:57:38.776
If you live
to have children.

722
00:57:38.776 --> 00:57:40.349
they’ll ask about me.

723
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:44.914
Where is this brittunculi queen

724
00:57:44.914 --> 00:57:48.148
who would dare
stop my cohort?

725
00:57:50.887 --> 00:57:54.495
Well... Speak. she-dog.

726
00:57:54.495 --> 00:57:58.697
I’m upset you don’t
recognize me. dear Catus.

727
00:57:58.697 --> 00:58:01.799
or has time been
so unkind to me?

728
00:58:04.406 --> 00:58:06.540
She is clearly insane.

729
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:08.168
Remove and pillar her head

730
00:58:08.168 --> 00:58:12.678
and don’t stop us
on such trivialities again!

731
00:58:12.678 --> 00:58:16.275
I’m Queen Boudica
of the Iceni and the Trinovante.

732
00:58:16.275 --> 00:58:19.817
the Celts. the Saxons.
of the northern Britons!

733
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:25.823
I am the wife
of King Prasutagus.

734
00:58:25.823 --> 00:58:28.793
And it will take
a lot more than your blood

735
00:58:28.793 --> 00:58:31.026
to cleanse the foulness
you inflicted

736
00:58:31.026 --> 00:58:33.127
on me and my daughters!

737
00:58:33.127 --> 00:58:36.163
Catus Decianus.

738
00:58:36.163 --> 00:58:38.473
Yeah. Come closer.

739
00:58:38.473 --> 00:58:40.706
and have a good look
at my face.

740
00:58:41.542 --> 00:58:43.544
Something you remember?

741
00:58:46.877 --> 00:58:48.274
Bou-di-ca.

742
00:58:51.013 --> 00:58:54.181
Nec Regina!

743
00:58:55.655 --> 00:58:59.186
Your scar has healed.

744
00:58:59.186 --> 00:59:04.730
My men prefer to train
with live targets!

745
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:06.963
Perhaps I shall grant them
that privilege.

746
00:59:06.963 --> 00:59:08.437
Now. my children.

747
00:59:11.297 --> 00:59:12.573
What witchery is this?

748
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:44.917
He was hiding in the woods.

749
01:02:44.917 --> 01:02:47.117
Aaah!

750
01:02:47.117 --> 01:02:50.285
Hail. Queen Boudica!

751
01:02:51.517 --> 01:02:52.793
You traitor!

752
01:02:57.589 --> 01:03:00.361
You traitor! Traitor!

753
01:03:02.264 --> 01:03:03.595
Traitor!

754
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:08.534
You were supposed
to protect him.

755
01:03:12.142 --> 01:03:14.540
Enough! It’s over!

756
01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.718
It’s over.

757
01:03:16.718 --> 01:03:19.721
We won the day.
It’s over.

758
01:03:19.721 --> 01:03:22.757
We won the day.

759
01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:26.090
Boudica. my queen.
It’s over.

760
01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:28.796
It’s not over
until every Roman has gone.

761
01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.359
My queen?

762
01:03:31.359 --> 01:03:33.702
We ride for Camulos.

763
01:03:33.702 --> 01:03:36.705
Governor Paulinus is still
biding his time in Rome.

764
01:03:36.705 --> 01:03:38.201
The last I’ve heard.

765
01:03:38.201 --> 01:03:39.939
his Gemina Legion
was mopping up Druids

766
01:03:39.939 --> 01:03:42.843
in Anglesey. so...
The timing is perfect.

767
01:03:42.843 --> 01:03:45.571
It will need a blessing
from the Druid council.

768
01:03:46.539 --> 01:03:47.914
You’ll see to it.

769
01:03:49.718 --> 01:03:51.082
You’re serious.

770
01:03:52.512 --> 01:03:54.646
And I suspect a little mental.

771
01:03:54.646 --> 01:03:55.988
My queen.

772
01:03:58.023 --> 01:04:00.025
But war favors the possessed.

773
01:04:02.324 --> 01:04:03.424
Where are you going?

774
01:04:05.195 --> 01:04:06.999
I reckon I’m going
to the Druid council

775
01:04:06.999 --> 01:04:09.694
to try to find
a reason for a...

776
01:04:09.694 --> 01:04:12.037
Celtic Trinovante invasion
of Camulos.

777
01:04:13.302 --> 01:04:14.534
You are indeed.

778
01:04:16.338 --> 01:04:17.438
Yeah.

779
01:04:47.468 --> 01:04:50.735
When you drink from the skull
of Catus Decianus.

780
01:04:50.735 --> 01:04:52.781
your victory is complete.

781
01:04:53.881 --> 01:04:55.113
It’s a tradition.

782
01:05:12.834 --> 01:05:16.805
There has of late
been a succession of ill omens

783
01:05:16.805 --> 01:05:19.203
for the Roman occupation force.

784
01:05:19.203 --> 01:05:22.701
Where they predict
misfortune for Nero.

785
01:05:22.701 --> 01:05:25.605
they promise fortune
for Brittania.

786
01:05:26.771 --> 01:05:27.948
and her queen...

787
01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.544
Boudica.

788
01:05:36.451 --> 01:05:38.519
The council supports your cause.

789
01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:41.456
us.

790
01:05:41.456 --> 01:05:43.458
There’s nothing
we cannot achieve.

791
01:05:50.399 --> 01:05:52.302
You’re staring at me.

792
01:05:52.302 --> 01:05:54.139
You have your hand
on my knee.

793
01:05:57.604 --> 01:05:58.803
Oh.

794
01:06:02.147 --> 01:06:03.742
Twenty years
of killing enemies

795
01:06:03.742 --> 01:06:05.348
and chasing their wives.

796
01:06:06.448 --> 01:06:08.417
Forgive me. my queen.

797
01:06:08.417 --> 01:06:09.990
You’re forgiven.

798
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:12.751
But if you ever
touch me like that again.

799
01:06:12.751 --> 01:06:14.786
I’ll kill you
before your little man

800
01:06:14.786 --> 01:06:16.788
has had a chance
to raise himself.

801
01:06:16.788 --> 01:06:18.295
By god. woman.

802
01:06:18.295 --> 01:06:21.364
if I didn’t already have
two wives...

803
01:06:21.364 --> 01:06:25.071
You have
a way with words. Wolfgar.

804
01:06:28.338 --> 01:06:29.570
No one would judge us.

805
01:06:31.506 --> 01:06:35.180
Two warrior leaders.
a man and a woman.

806
01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:38.447
forged together
like charcoal and iron

807
01:06:38.447 --> 01:06:40.889
to become steel
in the furnace of war.

808
01:06:43.353 --> 01:06:45.454
I am the wife
of King Prasutagus.

809
01:06:47.654 --> 01:06:48.930
Please leave.

810
01:07:04.209 --> 01:07:06.871
You’ve come far.
Queen Boudica.

811
01:07:06.871 --> 01:07:10.050
Life is impermanent.

812
01:07:10.809 --> 01:07:12.019
Transitory.

813
01:07:12.019 --> 01:07:16.958
We all die.
You. Your daughters.

814
01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:20.456
What do my daughters have
to do with this?

815
01:07:20.456 --> 01:07:23.723
They’re in your mind.
as you survived.

816
01:07:23.723 --> 01:07:25.032
They did not.

817
01:07:25.032 --> 01:07:27.067
No. They’re here.

818
01:07:27.067 --> 01:07:30.972
Like snowflakes in the air.

819
01:07:32.072 --> 01:07:34.074
So beautiful to watch.

820
01:07:35.042 --> 01:07:36.736
Snatch one in your hand.

821
01:07:38.573 --> 01:07:39.904
And when you look...

822
01:07:40.542 --> 01:07:42.247
It will be gone.

823
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:48.484
Like goosebumps.
the first breath of winter.

824
01:07:49.749 --> 01:07:52.290
They will always be
with you. Boudica.

825
01:07:53.126 --> 01:07:54.292
As spirits.

826
01:07:57.031 --> 01:07:58.857
Love what you can.

827
01:08:00.133 --> 01:08:02.696
Never forget
what it is that you love.

828
01:08:03.928 --> 01:08:05.567
As it defines you.

829
01:08:07.536 --> 01:08:09.802
I want to die.

830
01:08:09.802 --> 01:08:11.045
You will.

831
01:08:11.903 --> 01:08:15.016
But first. you must lead
your army again.

832
01:08:15.016 --> 01:08:19.988
The Druid council have
sanctioned your ride to Camulos.

833
01:08:22.287 --> 01:08:23.486
What if I refuse?

834
01:08:23.486 --> 01:08:26.258
You’re free to do as you wish.

835
01:08:26.258 --> 01:08:28.425
There are no rules
in this world.

836
01:08:29.624 --> 01:08:33.001
Except what death has put there.

837
01:08:56.915 --> 01:08:59.555
Queen. You must rest.

838
01:09:01.821 --> 01:09:03.757
Tell me...

839
01:09:03.757 --> 01:09:05.099
Do you see them?

840
01:09:05.627 --> 01:09:07.167
Do you see my daughters?

841
01:09:08.267 --> 01:09:10.830
They’re... good girls.

842
01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:12.205
They behave well.

843
01:09:12.205 --> 01:09:13.305
They’ve been waiting for you.

844
01:09:13.305 --> 01:09:15.274
No. I asked.
do you see them?

845
01:09:16.836 --> 01:09:18.002
See them?

846
01:09:18.002 --> 01:09:20.510
We see them
in our hearts. Queen.

847
01:09:37.593 --> 01:09:39.694
You need to wake up. Mother.

848
01:09:43.533 --> 01:09:47.933
If you attack Camulos.
the Romans will come after you.

849
01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:50.210
They will send archers
to destroy you.

850
01:09:55.479 --> 01:09:57.514
I will kill whoever they send.

851
01:09:57.514 --> 01:10:01.254
And find where they live
and kill their families.

852
01:10:02.486 --> 01:10:04.015
You must do it. Mother.

853
01:10:04.015 --> 01:10:06.754
For us. For Father.

854
01:10:08.492 --> 01:10:10.230
This would not
have happened.

855
01:10:10.230 --> 01:10:12.595
had I not chosen
to be queen.

856
01:10:13.893 --> 01:10:15.961
It was never
your choice. Mother.

857
01:10:18.029 --> 01:10:21.142
But if I wasn’t a queen.
we would still be together.

858
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:25.707
You look so real.

859
01:10:27.742 --> 01:10:29.315
I can feel you.

860
01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:31.977
I can smell you.

861
01:10:35.354 --> 01:10:36.949
But I know you’re not.

862
01:10:39.688 --> 01:10:41.492
We are here with you. Mother.

863
01:10:44.594 --> 01:10:47.795
You must get ready.
It’s time.

864
01:11:13.359 --> 01:11:15.394
The Romans murdered men.
women. and children

865
01:11:15.394 --> 01:11:17.528
when they occupied
the town of Camulos.

866
01:11:18.793 --> 01:11:20.498
They made it
a retirement settlement

867
01:11:20.498 --> 01:11:22.368
for the senior centurions.

868
01:11:24.997 --> 01:11:27.098
Do you want
to forgive and forget?

869
01:11:27.098 --> 01:11:30.101
We go home.
live another day?

870
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:33.808
Fuck them.

871
01:11:33.808 --> 01:11:36.448
Hail. That’s my queen.

872
01:11:40.452 --> 01:11:44.819
Go!

873
01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.520
You’ll make
a handsome centurion.

874
01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.984
Ivan.

875
01:12:50.984 --> 01:12:53.151
You know
I don’t like that shit!

876
01:12:57.859 --> 01:12:59.124
Boudica.

877
01:12:59.124 --> 01:13:00.532
We met them on their ground.

878
01:13:05.735 --> 01:13:07.275
He was a man
ahead of his time!

879
01:13:09.871 --> 01:13:10.971
Boudica!

880
01:13:35.567 --> 01:13:37.129
Beautiful retribution.

881
01:13:37.129 --> 01:13:40.770
It’s not over.
But it’s a start.

882
01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:17.235
Why aren’t they celebrating?

883
01:14:17.235 --> 01:14:19.908
To bear pain.
Tribute to the victory.

884
01:14:19.908 --> 01:14:21.008
To whom?

885
01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:24.517
Marco.

886
01:14:27.883 --> 01:14:31.623
By cutting your mark
into their cheek.

887
01:14:31.623 --> 01:14:34.395
they pay tribute
to you. my queen.

888
01:14:40.731 --> 01:14:42.799
Roman soldiers
have their stigma.

889
01:14:44.064 --> 01:14:46.330
now your men have theirs.

890
01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:47.573
What?

891
01:14:47.573 --> 01:14:50.004
Do they know
what it means?

892
01:14:50.004 --> 01:14:52.171
Who gives a shit?

893
01:14:52.171 --> 01:14:53.645
They can’t read Latin.

894
01:14:53.645 --> 01:14:55.746
Or any other language.
for that matter.

895
01:14:55.746 --> 01:14:58.419
But what matters
is that it’s your mark.

896
01:14:59.816 --> 01:15:01.180
They’re your army now.

897
01:15:07.351 --> 01:15:08.594
What are you doing?

898
01:15:10.992 --> 01:15:14.325
The Romans take pride
in their unit formations.

899
01:15:14.325 --> 01:15:16.536
and my men
take great pleasure

900
01:15:16.536 --> 01:15:18.934
in relieving the silks
from the defeated.

901
01:15:21.706 --> 01:15:24.170
These are the units
you’ve crushed.

902
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.449
The spoils of war.
my queen.

903
01:15:31.111 --> 01:15:32.915
It’s not nearly enough.

904
01:16:42.622 --> 01:16:44.525
Boudica!

905
01:17:35.268 --> 01:17:39.206
Hold the line!
Hold the line! Don’t break!

906
01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.989
Charge!

907
01:18:02.196 --> 01:18:04.704
Hold the line!

908
01:18:46.977 --> 01:18:49.342
The rioting is getting closer.

909
01:18:49.342 --> 01:18:50.783
It’s dangerous
for you to be here.

910
01:18:50.783 --> 01:18:52.752
Why do my people protest?

911
01:18:52.752 --> 01:18:54.688
The war in Europe was costly.

912
01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:56.349
Your people need a victory.

913
01:18:57.691 --> 01:18:58.890
It’s not my fault.

914
01:18:58.890 --> 01:19:01.585
It’s the fault
of that awful woman.

915
01:19:01.585 --> 01:19:02.993
They were your laws!

916
01:19:02.993 --> 01:19:05.831
Your orders that
caused the insurrection.

917
01:19:05.831 --> 01:19:08.801
And now Boudica
and her army seem unstoppable.

918
01:19:08.801 --> 01:19:10.462
My dear Paulinus...

919
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:15.269
I’m a musician.
not a warrior...

920
01:19:17.876 --> 01:19:20.142
Rome has forsaken me.

921
01:19:20.142 --> 01:19:21.308
Come with us.

922
01:19:22.881 --> 01:19:24.718
How will I defend myself?

923
01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:27.578
We’re not here
to do you harm.

924
01:19:27.578 --> 01:19:31.186
I have...
only to appear and sing

925
01:19:31.186 --> 01:19:32.385
to have peace once more

926
01:19:32.385 --> 01:19:33.925
- in Gaul.
- No!

927
01:19:46.872 --> 01:19:50.172
Then I shall give Rome
the victory that you could not.

928
01:19:56.244 --> 01:19:57.850
Prepare the troops to move.

929
01:19:57.850 --> 01:19:59.247
We sail in the morning.

930
01:20:40.222 --> 01:20:43.390
They are sending reinforcements
that we cannot defeat.

931
01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:45.326
Our army needs to recuperate.

932
01:20:45.326 --> 01:20:47.900
We will return in the spring
with more men from the north

933
01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:49.396
to bolster your ranks.

934
01:20:49.396 --> 01:20:52.597
What should my men think
of you leaving?

935
01:20:52.597 --> 01:20:54.533
You should send them
home as well.

936
01:20:57.206 --> 01:21:00.176
Because now
the time has come to retreat.

937
01:21:00.176 --> 01:21:02.376
I cannot lose.
you know that!

938
01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.115
Why not finish
what we started?

939
01:21:05.115 --> 01:21:08.921
You could become stronger
Briton king before you.

940
01:21:11.055 --> 01:21:13.893
I don’t ask my men
to fight in the winter.

941
01:21:15.191 --> 01:21:16.896
Your men should not either.

942
01:21:18.656 --> 01:21:20.999
When your men wake
to learn that he has left them.

943
01:21:20.999 --> 01:21:22.561
cause upset.

944
01:21:22.561 --> 01:21:26.037
He loves you.
but you have rejected him.

945
01:21:26.037 --> 01:21:27.808
So he leaves.

946
01:21:27.808 --> 01:21:29.337
Lay down with him.

947
01:21:29.337 --> 01:21:31.570
He will stay.

948
01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:34.144
He would be king.
you could be queen.

949
01:21:34.144 --> 01:21:38.115
Together. you would defy fate
and destroy Rome’s armies.

950
01:21:39.886 --> 01:21:41.646
I can love only one man.

951
01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:44.616
What do your daughters say?

952
01:21:47.718 --> 01:21:50.391
It is our swiftness
that destroyed the Romans.

953
01:21:51.392 --> 01:21:54.967
Move decisively
and we can end this occupation.

954
01:21:59.697 --> 01:22:01.336
But it will be without me.

955
01:22:01.336 --> 01:22:04.944
You’ll be sending
exhausted men to slaughter.

956
01:22:06.209 --> 01:22:07.672
I can order you to stay.

957
01:22:08.948 --> 01:22:10.246
Or...

958
01:22:10.246 --> 01:22:11.412
have you killed.

959
01:22:13.744 --> 01:22:14.954
You could.

960
01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:17.781
But you won’t.

961
01:22:34.105 --> 01:22:36.800
Be sure to take everything.

962
01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.176
Don’t leave anything behind.

963
01:22:51.958 --> 01:22:53.190
I cast no judgment.

964
01:22:56.094 --> 01:22:58.723
We will see each other
again in the Earrach.

965
01:22:58.723 --> 01:23:00.395
When the snow has melted.

966
01:23:02.034 --> 01:23:04.036
You’re the empress
of the land...

967
01:23:05.906 --> 01:23:07.039
the sky...

968
01:23:08.436 --> 01:23:09.569
the moon.

969
01:23:11.109 --> 01:23:12.913
But you will always be...

970
01:23:14.112 --> 01:23:15.344
my queen.

971
01:23:27.653 --> 01:23:29.391
Get yourselves ready!

972
01:23:29.391 --> 01:23:31.030
I want us moving
by sunlight.

973
01:23:52.216 --> 01:23:54.086
Who did they send
against me?

974
01:23:55.021 --> 01:23:56.121
As we speak.

975
01:23:56.121 --> 01:23:57.848
the great General Gaius Paulinus

976
01:23:57.848 --> 01:24:01.093
marches on his way
to Watling Street to meet you.

977
01:24:05.933 --> 01:24:07.132
Then...

978
01:24:10.432 --> 01:24:12.302
We will welcome him.

979
01:24:27.251 --> 01:24:30.188
We’ll use their
overconfidence to divide them.

980
01:24:30.188 --> 01:24:33.653
But these are not soldiers
that come to offer battle.

981
01:24:33.653 --> 01:24:35.820
They’re amateurs.

982
01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:39.692
And we. gentlemen.
are professionals.

983
01:24:41.199 --> 01:24:43.234
Eyes held high in pride

984
01:24:43.234 --> 01:24:45.665
are less able to see
the uneven ground ahead.

985
01:25:06.224 --> 01:25:08.292
Boudica! Boudica!

986
01:25:13.099 --> 01:25:17.631
Boudica! Kill them all!

987
01:25:23.406 --> 01:25:26.541
Boudica! Kill them all!

988
01:26:03.083 --> 01:26:04.546
I do not come...

989
01:26:06.152 --> 01:26:10.948
I do not come to boast
of a great ancestry.

990
01:26:10.948 --> 01:26:13.225
nor to recover my kingdom.

991
01:26:13.225 --> 01:26:16.294
I’m here to assert
the cause of liberty!

992
01:26:16.294 --> 01:26:19.022
Yes!

993
01:26:19.022 --> 01:26:21.266
From the pride
and arrogance of the Romans.

994
01:26:21.266 --> 01:26:22.597
nothing is sacred!

995
01:26:24.533 --> 01:26:27.668
The vindictive gods
are now at hand.

996
01:26:33.311 --> 01:26:34.444
Look around!

997
01:26:35.544 --> 01:26:37.843
See your brothers and sisters!

998
01:26:37.843 --> 01:26:40.219
And view our numbers.

999
01:26:40.219 --> 01:26:42.848
Behold how our tribes
come together

1000
01:26:42.848 --> 01:26:45.125
to draw the avenging sword.

1001
01:26:48.491 --> 01:26:51.296
On this spot...

1002
01:26:51.296 --> 01:26:53.199
- We must conquer!
- Yes!

1003
01:26:53.199 --> 01:26:56.598
Or die with glory.

1004
01:26:57.863 --> 01:27:00.833
There is no alternative!

1005
01:27:05.904 --> 01:27:08.038
Boudica! Kill them all!

1006
01:27:23.361 --> 01:27:24.791
Attack!

1007
01:27:34.438 --> 01:27:35.571
Aaaaaaah!

1008
01:27:40.004 --> 01:27:42.941
Infantry. split the line!

1009
01:27:44.415 --> 01:27:45.548
Auxiliary...

1010
01:27:45.548 --> 01:27:46.681
Hold...

1011
01:27:46.681 --> 01:27:47.781
Hold!

1012
01:27:49.387 --> 01:27:50.619
Check your bearing!

1013
01:27:53.391 --> 01:27:55.294
Archers. forward!

1014
01:27:55.294 --> 01:27:56.328
Archers...

1015
01:27:56.328 --> 01:27:57.461
pull!

1016
01:28:23.652 --> 01:28:24.950
Turn the chariot over!

1017
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:26.050
Turn it over!

1018
01:28:34.498 --> 01:28:35.664
Draw...

1019
01:28:51.317 --> 01:28:53.176
Draw... Loose!

1020
01:28:55.013 --> 01:28:56.355
Fire!

1021
01:29:09.797 --> 01:29:10.897
Fire!

1022
01:29:20.379 --> 01:29:25.747
Keep it coming. let’s go.
Lay into them. Wipe them out!

1023
01:29:28.211 --> 01:29:31.324
Ask your daughters
for help. Boudica. Now!

1024
01:29:33.392 --> 01:29:34.987
Girls!

1025
01:29:34.987 --> 01:29:36.593
Are you going to help us?

1026
01:29:36.593 --> 01:29:39.123
The time for fighting
is over. Mother.

1027
01:29:39.893 --> 01:29:41.895
Then what?

1028
01:29:41.895 --> 01:29:43.600
It’s time
for you to join us.

1029
01:29:46.834 --> 01:29:48.066
What do they say?

1030
01:29:52.642 --> 01:29:56.514
After all we’ve been through.
want to die cowering.

1031
01:29:59.242 --> 01:30:01.013
I go where you go.

1032
01:30:01.013 --> 01:30:02.454
On my command.

1033
01:30:05.556 --> 01:30:06.788
On your word. my queen.

1034
01:30:06.788 --> 01:30:09.494
Let’s go.

1035
01:30:43.121 --> 01:30:44.562
Boudica!

1036
01:30:44.562 --> 01:30:45.794
Aaaaah!

1037
01:31:46.591 --> 01:31:47.856
Boudica!

1038
01:31:49.286 --> 01:31:50.694
Boudica!

1039
01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:54.665
You are.
and you always will be.

1040
01:31:54.665 --> 01:31:55.798
my queen!

1041
01:32:21.428 --> 01:32:23.463
No!

1042
01:32:46.981 --> 01:32:49.687
Time to be a wife
and mother again.

1043
01:32:49.687 --> 01:32:51.414
To love and to cherish.

1044
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:55.561
Today.
your name in sacrifice

1045
01:32:55.561 --> 01:32:58.256
is more important
than your victory in battle.

1046
01:32:58.256 --> 01:33:00.060
It’s time to go. Mother.

1047
01:34:08.491 --> 01:34:10.130
