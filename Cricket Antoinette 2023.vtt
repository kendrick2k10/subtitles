00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.160
Good evening!

4
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.120
Wow. what a crowd!

5
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.240
For those of you we haven't met yet.
my name is Ket

6
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.560
and these are the Crickets!

7
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.200
<i>Ready for the summer fest of</i>

8
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.880
<i>Very special sonic treat?</i>

9
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.400
<i>Hearts are pounding. hips are swinging</i>

10
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.680
<i>To the same old beat</i>

11
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.400
<i>Drum and bass and fiddle's here</i>

12
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.360
<i>And. of course. yours truly</i>

13
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.080
<i>Every day we're here to party</i>

14
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.200
<i>Come and see the blisters burnin'</i>

15
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.400
<i>Pretty sure that there will be
No hunger or cold</i>

16
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.680
<i>However. what is life without the music?</i>

17
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.760
As if they were larvae just yesterday!

18
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.800
They grew up way too fast!

19
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.960
Look at my son. the antcademic graduate!

20
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.960
Look at him!

21
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.840
Antoinette. are you ready?

22
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.320
Anteodor must be wondering
where the love of his life is.

23
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.600
Oh. that golden imbecile!
Have you seen my cap anywhere?

24
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.680
You're not ready?

25
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.600
What's the big deal. Tenna?

26
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.520
I'll tell you!

27
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.720
Today is the day
when we finally become antchitects!

28
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.280
The most important day in ant's life!

29
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.080
That's debatable...

30
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.920
Starting tomorrow. I'll be
the Supreme Supervisor's assistant.

31
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.520
What will he think
if I miss my graduation?

32
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.480
Tenna. relax.
If we end up being a little late.

33
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.840
I'll tell my dad it's all my fault.

34
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.480
My career is gonna end
before it even began.

35
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.440
There you are.

36
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.920
Are you done?

37
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.640
Let's go.

38
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.680
Let's go.

39
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.839
Dear future antchitects
and their proud parents!

40
00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.480
The youth today!
Running where only walking's allowed.

41
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.720
On the behalf of Queen Antlisabeth
who is not with us at the moment.

42
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.800
and whom I'm temporarily replacing...

43
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.200
Poor thing. he still misses his mother.

44
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.520
I am especially proud of this generation
of antcademic antchitects

45
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.560
because. among other
truly brilliant graduates.

46
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.720
there's also my daughter Antoinette!

47
00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.840
The ceremony already begun.

48
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.040
Only nerds show up on time.

49
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.600
We are ants. We are all nerds.

50
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.000
We can make it if we use a shortcut!

51
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.080
Tenna!

52
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.760
This is the beginning of my era!

53
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.120
Our era!

54
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.920
I plan to build everything
according to my own designs!

55
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.800
Supreme Supervisor
won't be too thrilled about that.

56
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.080
Who'll say "no" to the best student?

57
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.960
Perhaps his daughter would?

58
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.040
No doubt.

59
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.480
Antoinette will be delighted
by my excellence.

60
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.120
A bright and shiny future awaits us!

61
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.440
Antcademic antchitect Anteodor.
best in his class.

62
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.800
who has graduated
<i>cum laude ante portas homini lupus.</i>

63
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.960
Anteodor. I congratulate you.
Bravo. great job.

64
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.840
- That's my son!
- Okay. sure.

65
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.320
I'm a proud father!

66
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.960
A facade? A facade
is not supposed to be used for climbing!

67
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.480
Are you coming to get your diploma?

68
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.360
Oh dear. help me.

69
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.360
Look out!

70
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.400
You can do it.

71
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.040
Don't be afraid. it's really easy!

72
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.120
Should we go back and just be late?

73
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.520
Come on. I don't know
why we usually don't use this--

74
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.240
Tell my dad I'll be a bit late!

75
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.960
Hold on Tenna. You can do it.

76
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.040
In accordance with our tradition.
the best antchitect in his class

77
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.040
can start building as early as tomorrow.

78
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.360
This must be documented!

79
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.600
Come on. relief makers!

80
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.360
Thank you.

81
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.040
Excuse me! Thank you! Sorry!

82
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.960
- Here I am!
- Is everything okay?

83
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.240
Where is Antoinette?

84
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.880
She asked me to tell you
that she'll be a little bit late.

85
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.120
Oh. Mother Nature...

86
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.640
Mother? No. Mother!

87
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.840
Who are you?

88
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.320
- You seriously don't know who we are?
- Allow me.

89
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.800
My name is Ket and this is my band.

90
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.280
Here we have Rudi on the drums.

91
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.760
The violine virtuoso. Ernest.

92
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.520
On the bass. Contra.

93
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.520
- And yours truly. Ket.
- You already said that.

94
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.200
Guitarist. composer. singer
and songwriter. at your service.

95
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.280
Not sure about the "singer" part.

96
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.520
Why so negative in front of a lady?

97
00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.720
I don't want to scare you.
but it seems that the lady is an...

98
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.920
- I'm Antoinette.
- She's a whatchamacallit...

99
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.840
- An ant.
- That!

100
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.480
Indeed. an ant.
We never see you at the festival.

101
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.520
Nowhere beyond law and order.

102
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.640
I have a question.

103
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.640
- This festival is called...
- Roachella!

104
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.240
Chichella. that's right.
Do you guys play music at this festival?

105
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.400
At the festival. we live music.

106
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.720
Yes. of course you do.

107
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.520
I'd say it's about time
you head back where you came from.

108
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.840
That's right.

109
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.840
Like they say.
"When an ant comes to a party..."

110
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.520
"The party comes to an end!"

111
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.120
This is great.
Who will bother me on my way back?

112
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.360
No one.

113
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.840
Awesome. I'm staying here.

114
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.520
Bye! Yes.

115
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.120
Hands up!

116
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.200
Thank you.

117
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.320
I did it!

118
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.840
Winter is coming!

119
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.440
When the stars begin to fall.
every cricket will be gone!

120
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.400
Ignore him. That's just Frosty.

121
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.680
He's obsessed with this so-called winter.
No idea what that's all about.

122
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.360
Hey!

123
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.080
Cockroach serves the best breakfast
all day long.

124
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.080
Breakfast all day long?

125
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.080
Living from one day to the next

126
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.840
and playing music till dawn.

127
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.720
That's Roachella. bug!

128
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.400
Ridiculous.

129
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.880
- Can you?
- What? Carry you home?

130
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.800
Thanks a bunch.

131
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.000
- Don't mention it.
- I won't.

132
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.000
You love to work out. huh?

133
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.040
And you must really love to fly!

134
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.600
So what exactly
do you guys do up at the anthill?

135
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.320
What do you mean? We live there.

136
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.440
- You live there?
- Yes.

137
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.880
- Isn't it dark inside?
- We have windows.

138
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.600
For light that you already have outside?

139
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.320
When the rain or stars fall.
you need the roof.

140
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.040
I've never seen rain hurt anyone before.

141
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.600
Usually it has the opposite effect.

142
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.160
So what exactly makes your houses better?

143
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.400
Houses? What houses? This is our home!

144
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.040
Look at this splendor.

145
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.760
Is your bed's too firm or too soft?

146
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.840
Try the next one!

147
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.280
Look at the ceiling.

148
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.000
It changes color and shape
from the morning till the evening.

149
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.440
If you're lucky enough.
you'll even find a nice bathtub.

150
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.000
And artwork is...

151
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.000
the best part.

152
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.960
It's nice enough.

153
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.320
What did you do?

154
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.120
What did I do? I just played music!

155
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.360
Hold on. That's music?

156
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.640
- Music can tear down walls.
- True.

157
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.880
It really does. What do you do for fun?

158
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.960
I'm not sure where to start.

159
00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.680
The Antchademy was fun in a way. I guess...

160
00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.480
Now that I've graduated--
Actually I haven't.

161
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.200
But I'll be working on my designs
and work is apparently fun.

162
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.480
We also have breakfast.
lunch and dinner in proper order.

163
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.040
Anyway. work is supposed to be fun for me.

164
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:24.400
I'm an ant. And ants live over there.

165
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.520
Oh. this is the anthill.

166
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.280
So...

167
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.480
- This is it.
- Yes.

168
00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.240
Mission accomplished.

169
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.680
- Have fun this summer!
- You too! Enjoy...

170
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.000
- Work?
- Thank you.

171
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.280
- And order.
- Sure. and discipline.

172
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.200
Don't move!

173
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.600
We're detaining you
under Article 4. Paragraph 2!

174
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.240
- No way!
- Yes.

175
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.080
Knocking on anthill doors
was illegal even when Aesop was alive!

176
00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.720
Do you have
any weapons of mass destruction?

177
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.080
- No.
- Here it is!

178
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.920
- It's just a ukulele!
- For mass destruction!

179
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.640
- Unnamed cricket...
- Ket.

180
00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.040
You are accused of the act
of knocking on anthill doors

181
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.800
and an attempt to smuggle in a weapon.

182
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.720
You'll be in prison
until the last day of autumn.

183
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.600
Just as you knocked. so shall you play.

184
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.280
Not only did you miss your own graduation...

185
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.400
I was late.

186
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.280
The most important moment
in the ant's life.

187
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.320
That's debatable...

188
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.680
You endangered the entire anthill
because the cricket followed you.

189
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.560
So I wouldn't get lost!

190
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.480
In an attempt to enter the anthill

191
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.840
and destroy everything
with his ghastly music.

192
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.000
He could have kidnapped and dragged you

193
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.640
to that savage gathering they call...

194
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.560
- Chichella.
- A festival.

195
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.400
There. there.

196
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.000
Everything is okay now.

197
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.480
You need to grow up.

198
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.600
Important duties await you.
You will be the next Queen Ant.

199
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.280
That is your future.

200
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.040
Music!

201
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.600
This is an alert! Music in the anthill!

202
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.440
<i>We repeat.</i>

203
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.520
<i>Alert! Music in the anthill.</i>

204
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.280
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

205
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.840
<i>We repeat.</i>

206
00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.080
This is not a drill.

207
00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.720
<i>Begin Protocol One.</i>

208
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.079
Ket.

209
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.720
Why are you here?

210
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.440
Article 4. Paragraph 2.

211
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.400
Oh. that's right.
Don't worry. I know a way out.

212
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.160
Now that you're here. it's not that bad.

213
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.600
Come on.

214
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.320
You guys believe music
can tear down walls?

215
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.760
You agreed!

216
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.760
I meant it figuratively!
Like. "The heart as big as a house."

217
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.960
Of course it's not. It's nonsense!

218
00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.680
Stay low and follow me!

219
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.720
Ket!

220
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.440
What are you doing?

221
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.400
Oops!

222
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.200
Stop!

223
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.880
Stop!

224
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.640
Hurry up!

225
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.800
Hey. we told you to stop!

226
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.640
Go left and follow the path to the pillar.

227
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.400
- You'll see the door.
- And you?

228
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.360
Go!

229
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.640
While you still can.

230
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.160
Have you seen the offender?

231
00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.840
Thank you!

232
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.280
Oh. it's only you!

233
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.920
Yes. I couldn't sleep.

234
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.480
Me neither. my dear. me neither.

235
00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.480
Don't be scared.

236
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.880
That vicious cricket won't be back.

237
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.280
and when the stars
fall from the sky. he'll be dead.

238
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.360
Dead?

239
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.920
Yeah. crickets aren't builders. you know.

240
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.400
Therefore. no cricket
is able to survive the winter.

241
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.480
Beautiful. peaceful winter.

242
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.240
without any news
or excitement of any kind.

243
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.600
Right.

244
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.760
Tenna!

245
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.200
I've finished the designs!

246
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.560
Tenna. it's me!

247
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.080
What are you doing here?

248
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.000
- This is serious.
- Right.

249
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.320
You've got to promise me
you won't say a word to anyone.

250
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.040
Especially not my dad.

251
00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.080
Spit it out.
Night is for sleeping. not babbling.

252
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.880
- I'm off to Chichella.
- Where?

253
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.040
I have to save the crickets.

254
00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.720
You have to save them?

255
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.600
They won't survive the winter
unless they find a shelter.

256
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.400
- And their houses?
- They don't believe in them!

257
00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.840
Oh. Mother Nature!

258
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.200
I'll just tell them that
and I'll be back before lunch.

259
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.760
- Or dinner. at the latest.
- They'll be serving sugar powder.

260
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.000
- Not a word to anyone.
- Right.

261
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.120
Especially not your dad.
I got it. Good night.

262
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.960
- Ket! You're all here! Great.
- You!

263
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.120
Everything okay?

264
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.280
Will you take him back to prison?

265
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.480
- I didn't put him--
- Leave her alone.

266
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.320
- She saved me.
- And put you behind bars.

267
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.600
They sounded great.

268
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.920
Who else is coming? The guards?
Or perhaps the whole army of ants?

269
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.840
No one. Except for the winter.

270
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.000
So. winter is coming?
You've got to be kidding me!

271
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.440
Dangerous stars fall during the winter.

272
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.760
Made of ice. full of spikes!
They'll destroy everything.

273
00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.680
Your stage. instruments.

274
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.680
And you in the end.

275
00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.080
They're gigantic and dangerous!

276
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.400
Stars are falling!

277
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.240
- Mock me all you like.
- That's nonsense I expect from--

278
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.440
- Winter is coming!
- Frosty.

279
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.560
You two know each other?

280
00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.040
Gentlemen. it was nice knowing you.

281
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:37.000
Hey. Everything's fine.
You've been fooled. winter isn't real.

282
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.640
It's an urban myth.

283
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.640
And for you. milady?

284
00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.120
You're an ant?

285
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.760
What brings you here?

286
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.960
Love for the winter. it seems.

287
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.120
Winter?

288
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.680
Winter isn't real!

289
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.360
If it were. we'd be making plans
for a winter tour right now!

290
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.320
<i>Winter. you say?</i>

291
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.320
Yes. winter.

292
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.960
<i>One with sharp. icy splinters?</i>

293
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:16.760
<i>Trust me. no matter how wicked
These are the tales for baby crickets</i>

294
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.880
<i>Ain't no winter</i>

295
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.640
<i>Ain't no worries</i>

296
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.640
Yes there are.

297
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.320
<i>Shoulda. woulda. coulda</i>

298
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.200
<i>- Who wants to fret about that?</i>
- I do.

299
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.480
<i>Ain't no winter</i>

300
00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.040
<i>Ain't no worries</i>

301
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.640
<i>- Shoulda. woulda. coulda</i>
- Listen to me.

302
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.640
<i>No need to think about it</i>

303
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.440
<i>Krampus or bugeyman</i>

304
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.920
<i>We all know it's just a sham</i>

305
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.760
<i>Let the ants complain and yammer</i>

306
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.080
<i>Live your life in an easy manner</i>

307
00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.280
By the way.

308
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.320
you've got a new gig tomorrow at dusk.

309
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.920
- Tomorrow? Really?
- Cool!

310
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.440
That's super bugsome!

311
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.840
I told them nicely.

312
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.040
Start now and the roof
will be finished by the autumn.

313
00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.760
But you'd rather play all summer long
just to avoid doing any actual work!

314
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.360
Playing music never helped anybody.

315
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.120
Excuse me.

316
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:32.680
One of the most common errors
one can make in life

317
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.880
is to ask questions

318
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.240
they already know the answers to.

319
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.160
No. don't ever do that again.

320
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.960
And you are?

321
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.640
My name is Bettie.

322
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.200
Local psychic

323
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:54.480
and your friendly festival guide
to self-realization.

324
00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:00.240
If you feel the urge
to take a deeper look into the future.

325
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.320
fortune-telling is one
of the many lovely gifts

326
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.480
that was generously bestowed upon me
by the spirit of the Humble Snail.

327
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.560
This is not that snail.

328
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.480
This is George.

329
00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.680
Come in.

330
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.120
Yes.

331
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.360
I'm listening.

332
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.200
Alright.

333
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.760
You're wondering

334
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.040
why your truths have no resonance at all.

335
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.120
Why is it that no one ever
listens to your words?

336
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:41.520
And why does it seem
that you are constantly surrounded

337
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.800
by stubborn and biased souls

338
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.720
who keep clinging
to the same old foolish beliefs?

339
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.040
Maybe a bit.

340
00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.800
Let me check.

341
00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.000
Oh. that's brilliant! Sure. Bye.

342
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.080
Okay. and?

343
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.000
And what?

344
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.880
- What is my future?
- Oh. Nettie.

345
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.080
The future is what you make of it.

346
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.960
What did you want to tell me?

347
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.240
If they don't listen to your words.

348
00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.600
maybe they will listen to your song.

349
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.680
Ridiculous. Ants don't know how to sing.

350
00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.880
Only an ant would say something like that.

351
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.280
But I am an ant.

352
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.400
The magical raspberry.

353
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.720
Raspberry Hat!

354
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:44.120
For many winters it's been bestowing
its owners with a beautiful voice.

355
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.600
but only if they wear it with pride.

356
00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.880
You have finally found
the purpose of your arrival!

357
00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.840
Your intentions are truly noble.
and your voice

358
00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.880
has the power
to change both worlds for the better.

359
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.600
Okay.

360
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.640
The construction of the stairs
is too weak.

361
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.720
I got straight A's in Junctions Two.

362
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.920
There is a visible crack.

363
00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.040
You've forgotten your glasses!

364
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.480
Take a better look.

365
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.480
Workers!

366
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.600
Is my father paying you to build cracks?

367
00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.840
This is a modern design. Work faster!

368
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.960
Isn't it just marvelous?

369
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.920
My son Anteodor is a true visionary.

370
00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.520
Antheodor. daddy.

371
00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.040
You can't even imagine how proud I am.

372
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.040
Supreme Supervisor. I don't want to panic.

373
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:58.840
but everything around here
is kind of upside-down.

374
00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.880
I forgot to tell you something.

375
00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.280
I have decided
to flip the design upside-down

376
00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.440
and build the upside-down mansion.

377
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.480
Anteodor. you should have submitted
that new design for approval.

378
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.360
Yes. but this is faster.

379
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.360
Everything is upside-down.

380
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.960
By the way.
have you seen Antoinette lately?

381
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.440
Who? Antoinette? No.

382
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.280
Strange. nobody has.

383
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.120
I'll order the antgents
to search for her again.

384
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.840
It's 10:52 a.m.
First suspect is heading north.

385
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.800
Roger that.

386
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.440
It's 10:53 a.m. We are also heading north.

387
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.480
It's 10:57 a.m. We lost the suspect.

388
00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.200
Hands up!
You are suspected of kidnapping--

389
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.480
They need a bit of color!

390
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.760
They're so cute.

391
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.080
And glitter.

392
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.560
I adore glitter!

393
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.080
Yes!

394
00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.200
A pair of suspicious ants
isn't an invasion.

395
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.960
Like I said before.
that girl is nothing but trouble.

396
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.320
You're overreacting.

397
00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.680
Ket. we all know that you like her.

398
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.520
She's interesting-ish.

399
00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.440
Was the prison also interesting-ish?

400
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.360
I propose a vote.

401
00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.000
Who wants to kick out Antoinette?

402
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.720
I'm sorry. buddy.

403
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.880
Look. you're taking her back
where she belongs.

404
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.120
Yeah. Everyone there is just like her.

405
00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.680
They believe in "winter"
and eat breakfast in the morning.

406
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:16.240
They can't sing. they talk like nerds
and they are dull.

407
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.960
- They like to work a lot...
- I can do it.

408
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.840
<i>It's true that you can sing too</i>

409
00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:31.080
<i>No matter what anyone tells you</i>

410
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.640
<i>No matter the mood</i>

411
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.320
<i>Think of the tune</i>

412
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.960
<i>May be easy to croon to</i>

413
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.760
<i>Happy or blue</i>

414
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:53.720
<i>Open yourself to the world
Sing your heart out</i>

415
00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:59.520
<i>Loud and with no doubt
It's never too soon</i>

416
00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.040
You're hired!

417
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.520
<i>It's true that you can sing too</i>

418
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:11.840
<i>It's true that I can sing too
And so can you</i>

419
00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.120
<i>We can sing all together</i>

420
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:19.360
<i>Solo or in a group or just a capella</i>

421
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.640
<i>If you're a girl
Or if you're a fellow</i>

422
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.440
<i>It's true that I can sing too
And so can you</i>

423
00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.880
<i>We can sing all together</i>

424
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.720
<i>Any day of the week</i>

425
00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.320
<i>Any month of the season</i>

426
00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.440
<i>It doesn't matter if you sing out of tune</i>

427
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.720
<i>Or like prima donna</i>

428
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.720
<i>Even in sauna</i>

429
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.400
<i>Some people will laugh</i>

430
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.280
<i>Some will adore ya</i>

431
00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:17.000
<i>It's true that I can sing too
And so can you</i>

432
00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.760
<i>We can sing all together</i>

433
00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.800
<i>Just let yourself get carried away</i>

434
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.760
<i>Fly off to dreamland</i>

435
00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.840
<i>With your own dream band</i>

436
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.560
<i>It doesn't matter if you sing out of tune</i>

437
00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.440
<i>Or like prima donna</i>

438
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.720
<i>Even in sauna</i>

439
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.880
<i>Some people will laugh</i>

440
00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:51.640
<i>Some will adore you</i>

441
00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:13.199
There you are!
What a brilliant performance.

442
00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.480
Your voice is just the thing
that was missing all along.

443
00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.840
Here's your salary.

444
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.040
Thank you.

445
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.800
You know. you may want to chill
with all that "winter" talk.

446
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.880
What is there to sing about?

447
00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:37.080
Everything's white and frozen.
Nothing ever happens.

448
00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.800
Wait a minute.

449
00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.840
You don't believe in it.
but you can describe it?

450
00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:49.080
You talk about it so much
we all know what it looks like.

451
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.679
Here I come!

452
00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:00.080
Five times you've returned empty-handed.

453
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.440
This time we really thought we had her.

454
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.080
But we mistook her for a tall cricket.

455
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.200
She is very clever.

456
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.880
I know.

457
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.440
I'm still degrading you
to the position of entrance guards.

458
00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.440
I have great news for you. sir!

459
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.160
Antoinette is finally back?

460
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.600
Even better. I need permission
to build three more floors.

461
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.040
Three more? I haven't approved
the first five yet!

462
00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.040
Can this merely be
your fear of my modernity?

463
00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.080
Anteodor...

464
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.520
Hurry up. I've already ordered the mud.

465
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.560
Anteodor. hold on for a moment!

466
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.440
I see!

467
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.240
The antgents haven't found Antoinette
and that's why you're mad.

468
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.320
I'm angry
because you build recklessly and--

469
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.000
Calm down.

470
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.560
You must be terribly worried
about you little Antoinette.

471
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.920
I'm going crazy.

472
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.400
I'm worried too.

473
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:56.280
In fact. I am so worried
that I'll find her myself.

474
00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.760
I'll bring Antoinette home
and you'll issue the permit.

475
00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.080
Let's see if you can find her first.

476
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.240
Perfect.

477
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.440
Move.

478
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:52.720
The same.

479
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.520
Here you go.

480
00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.480
- They're into conceptual art?
- Totally!

481
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.520
I'm skeptical.

482
00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.400
All of their new songs are about winter.

483
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:10.760
They question the paradigm
of urban legends and seasons.

484
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.760
I'm still skeptical.

485
00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.240
They sound better than ever
since they got a new singer!

486
00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.160
She looks like an ant to me.

487
00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:23.400
Maybe a bit from a distance.
but when you hear her voice...

488
00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.920
- That's true. Ants can't sing.
- Exactly!

489
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:31.800
I'm sorry to intrude.
but hearing all the praises.

490
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.680
I am dying to see that band!

491
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.520
That's what I call enthusiasm.

492
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.720
When is their next gig?

493
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.440
They live in the moment. buddy.

494
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.840
It was phenomenal.

495
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.720
Everything was perfect.

496
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.440
What a strong grip.

497
00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.320
That was awesome.
Well done! Toni. you rocked!

498
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.320
- I was thinking...
- Me too.

499
00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.840
- You too?
- When you play...

500
00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.080
I could sing...

501
00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.200
Not that.

502
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.440
I wanted to ask...

503
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:23.280
If you're not busy tonight...

504
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:28.600
Would you go out with me?

505
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.040
Excuse me?

506
00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.200
- What?
- What?

507
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.760
Go out with me.

508
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.600
I think I'd like that.

509
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.800
- Yes?
- Yes.

510
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.320
I'll pick you up in an hour or so.

511
00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.800
Okay. I'll be late.

512
00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.920
Oh. it's you! What are you doing here?

513
00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.680
This place is starting to affect you.

514
00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.320
You really think so? Thank you so much!

515
00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.320
Are you staying for the concert?

516
00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:28.160
The only reason I came
to this horrid place is to take you home.

517
00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.840
This is my path.

518
00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.440
- I'm staying.
- Do you know what others are saying?

519
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.920
That you're singing.

520
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.800
They know?

521
00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.400
Do they like it or hate it?
Did they offer us a record deal?

522
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.800
What about my hat?

523
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.440
You are so funny.

524
00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.160
I'm not joking. I can really sing.

525
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.280
Ants can't sing.

526
00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.760
They can. if they wear
the Magical Raspberry Hat!

527
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.840
That is not here.

528
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.840
You're such an ant. Relax
and live a little. you're at Roachella!

529
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.760
I've got to go. I have a date. With music!

530
00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.440
See you later then! Have fun!

531
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.360
Girls. I need your help.

532
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.880
This one?

533
00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.040
This one?

534
00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.520
No.

535
00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.240
- It's perfect.
- No.

536
00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.440
This one?

537
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.040
Oh. yes!

538
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.280
Great!

539
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.640
This freedom is nice. isn't it? Look.

540
00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.600
The anthill has rules.
That might sound a little bit boring.

541
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.360
It sounds very boring.

542
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.960
But breaking the rules
can be a lot of fun.

543
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.120
- More fun than music?
- Nothing is.

544
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.600
I was afraid this walk
might end at the anthill.

545
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.160
At your service.

546
00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.040
Thank you.

547
00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.680
Right.

548
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.080
You know. I miss the anthill.

549
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.240
but I can't imagine my life
without music and crickets.

550
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.720
Especially you. Ket.

551
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.200
They're such naive fools.

552
00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.200
Only cricket can be this careless.

553
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:01.640
Despicable.

554
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.600
I never thought
I'd fall for someone like you.

555
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:23.560
Cricket girls are fun and cool.
but in a different way.

556
00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:26.880
- Oh. really?
- But there's no one like you.

557
00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.280
I wish this could last forever.

558
00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.040
Why not? The future is a state of mind.

559
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.240
The future is a matter of seasons
and those are the facts!

560
00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.360
Spring. summer. autumn and winter.

561
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:49.360
No. Spring. summer. autumn.

562
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.800
I'm glad you stick to your theories.
however ridiculous they are.

563
00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.400
Yeah. We're that kind of a couple.

564
00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.800
I love this experimental sound.

565
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.880
Oh. there you are.

566
00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.160
You vicious destroyer
of ant moral and decency.

567
00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.240
See ya.

568
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.640
We've been living like that forever.

569
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.880
Free and unshackled.

570
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.200
Someday we could make
our very own festival

571
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.400
and all the bugs would be welcome.

572
00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.200
And tomorrow we could make a picnic
and I'll bring the ukulele.

573
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:36.920
My condolences.

574
00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.920
That was malicious.

575
00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.280
What a useless
and utterly malicious crime.

576
00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.880
Who would do something like this
to harmless instruments?

577
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.520
Is everything okay?

578
00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:27.840
I need to tell you something horrible.

579
00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.520
I lost my Raspberry Hat.

580
00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.920
Don't get mad...

581
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.160
- We have bigger problems than your hat.
- Yes.

582
00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:43.720
And no one will miss
that thing that was on your head.

583
00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.720
You're being awfully rude to me!

584
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.720
Don't stress about it. We'll fix
the instruments and find a new hat.

585
00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.960
No. I want my hat!

586
00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.440
But why that hat?

587
00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:57.360
Because it was mag--
magnificently special.

588
00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:03.120
Well. hats off to your special hat.
but we can't play without instruments.

589
00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.360
And I'm sure you'll be able
to sing without that hat.

590
00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.120
That's women for you.

591
00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.120
Can't live with them
and can't live with them.

592
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.160
I think too many floors
will be the least of our worries.

593
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.640
- Yes.
- This doesn't look stable.

594
00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:34.200
Call me old-fashioned. but
I see no point in building upside-down.

595
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.320
I know.

596
00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.360
Sir!

597
00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.440
- Hello. Antenna.
- Hello. Anteodor.

598
00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.440
- It's extraordinary. isn't it?
- It's certainly out of the ordinary.

599
00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.920
How many floors have you already built?

600
00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.200
The exact number you'll approve.

601
00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.360
Due to eastern winds. I shouldn't approve

602
00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.640
more than two floors.

603
00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.200
- By the way. she sends her greetings.
- Who?

604
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.080
- Antoinette.
- Antoinette? Is she here?

605
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.040
She will be very soon.

606
00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.560
- Do I reject the permit?
- Oh. my dear Antoinette!

607
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.680
I'm gonna ask the cooks to prepare

608
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.640
her favorite dish.

609
00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:27.680
Toni and the Crickets!

610
00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.840
Hey!

611
00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.480
Toni and the Crickets!

612
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.120
Ready?

613
00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.440
- I'm not sure if I can do this.
- Come on!

614
00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.640
- You can't live without singing.
- Maybe I'll have to.

615
00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:47.320
Toni and the Crickets!

616
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.520
Go. Toni! I love you!

617
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.240
Let's go. Toni!

618
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.240
Here. take this.

619
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.440
Hey...

620
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.520
Young lady!

621
00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.080
They were right.

622
00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.960
When an ant comes to a party.
the party is over.

623
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.240
There's no place for me in his life.

624
00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.480
Stop! No.
Why would you say something like that?

625
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.160
"I can't sing."

626
00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.160
The Raspberry Hat. It's gone.

627
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:02.880
I'm sorry.

628
00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:08.200
You should consult
the fantastic and mystical ball

629
00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:13.720
before making any irrational.
large-scale. life-changing decisions.

630
00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.680
Watch your step!

631
00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.160
This is criminal!

632
00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.840
- Well...
- Disgraceful!

633
00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.880
Mom. is that the girl who ran away?

634
00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.840
Anthal! It's rude to stare. Let's go.

635
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.680
I think it's her.

636
00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:51.800
Antoinette.

637
00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.720
Okay. this is the moment.
I am golden. I am present.

638
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.120
I deserve the reality I reach for.
I'm entering myself.

639
00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.320
Antoinette!

640
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.160
- I brought you home! Hey. everyone!
- Hey!

641
00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.440
I've brought Antoinette back home!

642
00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.440
How did you bring me back?

643
00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.320
Thanks to me. Antoinette is safe.

644
00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:17.960
The story goes. "As Antoinette
lovingly looked at her one and only savior

645
00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.240
named Antheodor the Ant.
a genius antchitect..."

646
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.360
That's me!

647
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.920
He tenderly whispered. "My sweet darling.

648
00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.920
spring should bear thy name!"

649
00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.840
That's not how it went...

650
00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.240
Poor thing. She's still in shock!

651
00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.440
That's my son. The hero.

652
00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.040
This must be documented!

653
00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.840
Relief makers. come!

654
00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.400
- My hair.
- A bit to the left. Thank you.

655
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.280
Smile!

656
00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:28.000
<i>The song dies down</i>

657
00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.200
<i>Just like the rain</i>

658
00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:36.440
<i>And some are leaving</i>

659
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:47.120
<i>Lovely shades of autumn</i>

660
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.600
<i>Lose their shine</i>

661
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:07.520
<i>All the happy days</i>

662
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:15.480
<i>Are left far behind</i>

663
00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.200
<i>Look. the stars are falling</i>

664
00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.000
<i>Summer's gone</i>

665
00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.760
<i>Only the memories keep us warm</i>

666
00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.280
<i>Just one more hug</i>

667
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:08.960
<i>Are all the happy days</i>

668
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:17.640
<i>Behind us?</i>

669
00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.120
I really hate this cursed weather.

670
00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:30.080
It has seriously damaged
my precious Strantivarius violin.

671
00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.520
Why are you complaining?

672
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.200
- How's it going. fellows?
- What's up. Roach?

673
00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.240
Here are your earning for tonight.

674
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.880
Gosh...

675
00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.480
Come. drinks are on the house.

676
00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:52.440
There's nectar for everyone
at the Roach's.

677
00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:00.880
Top-notch!

678
00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:15.000
Ket. my friend. you need to move on.

679
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.960
Ants.

680
00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.600
They make everybody miserable.

681
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.560
Even when they birds like the sing.

682
00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.520
Sing like birds!

683
00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.240
I guess you're right.

684
00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.920
What are you plans
for the winter holidays?

685
00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:35.000
I've found myself a lovely pantry.

686
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.920
It's stocked with food. warm and cozy.

687
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.400
Perfect shelter for anyone
who wants to survive a long cold wint--

688
00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.840
Antoinette was right! Winter does exist!

689
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:52.320
- I've never been frozen.
- You will be now.

690
00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:06.600
Young lady. would you be so kind?

691
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.120
"Get that fiddler off the roof.

692
00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:15.680
A new take on the myth that
restores faith in the value of silence."

693
00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:34.520
<i>The frugal ant worked all summer long.</i>

694
00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:40.200
<i>Cricket wrote his music
and played his songs.</i>

695
00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:45.640
<i>But come winter season.
having nothing left to eat.</i>

696
00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:50.480
<i>the cricket had to throw himself
before the ant's feet!</i>

697
00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:57.520
The gentle ant found it very easy
to decline the lazy bugger's guile.

698
00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.600
<i>With a smile he said.</i>

699
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:03.680
<i>"As you sang and played.
you worthless scum.</i>

700
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.320
<i>now dance your days away
until you're done!"</i>

701
00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.360
<i>The ant. of course. did nothing wrong.</i>

702
00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:18.280
<i>but still the cricket
played a vengeful song.</i>

703
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:23.080
Echoing the walls the ants had built.

704
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:26.760
<i>and tore them down without shame or guilt.</i>

705
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:33.000
<i>He plundered their food
and all their other stuff.</i>

706
00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.920
<i>But. once the villain
ran away to his friends.</i>

707
00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:44.160
<i>the diligent ants</i>

708
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.240
<i>built everything once again.</i>

709
00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:55.120
<i>They learned a valuable lesson
once and for all.</i>

710
00:56:55.720 --> 00:57:00.560
Music is a bad thing
that only breaks the walls!

711
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.040
Yes!

712
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:07.600
<i>Ever since. ants honor
a sacred law set in stone.</i>

713
00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:14.360
Never ever let a cricket
come into your home!

714
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:29.160
And then the ground
below the little feet shall turn into--

715
00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.680
But when will the winter arrive? When?

716
00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.840
I'll ask.

717
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:37.400
Yes. I see.

718
00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:40.920
The winter will arrive when--

719
00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:44.600
I knew it. winter is coming!

720
00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:47.320
Tell me. is it true?

721
00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.040
She was right.

722
00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:56.320
Spring. summer. autumn. winter!

723
00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:59.240
She will not want to see me anymore.

724
00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:02.880
Ket. young man. Musician.

725
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:07.840
The departure of the noble Antoinette
was seasoned with tears

726
00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.160
like curry with hot peppers.

727
00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:15.240
She run back home believing
that she had forever lost your heart.

728
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:18.120
I need to find her.

729
00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.640
You truly believe

730
00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:23.160
in the existence of winter?

731
00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:26.040
- I believe Antoinette.
- How about you?

732
00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:30.240
I don't know what to believe in.
but I do believe in winter.

733
00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.680
I finally understand
this weird feeling in my exoskeleton.

734
00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.160
Yes.

735
00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:38.360
My little Nettie has finally succeeded!

736
00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:43.280
She has managed to convince
more than one cricket

737
00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.240
that winter does exist.

738
00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.680
- You're...
- An ant?

739
00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:07.520
Judging by your immense height.

740
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.880
dare I assume that you are in fact

741
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.880
Queen Ant?

742
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:20.440
You've been here all summer
and you didn't try to stop the music?

743
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:26.080
I didn't come here to stop the music.
I came to end the superstitious beliefs.

744
00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.200
Winter is coming!

745
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.040
Yeah. okay. we all know now.

746
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.440
Stop talking!

747
00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:33.480
It's high time we end another superstition

748
00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.520
at the place where it originated!

749
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.040
Careful!

750
00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:56.160
One. two. three...

751
01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.200
Let's head to the anthill! My anthill!

752
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:17.720
<i>We're the crickets and we're green
Doing our best to carry the Queen</i>

753
01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:22.560
<i>Even though she isn't heavy
She's not lean so keep it steady</i>

754
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:28.240
<i>Even though she isn't heavy
She's not lean so keep it steady</i>

755
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.440
One. two. three...

756
01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:38.800
I never thought I'd say this.
but I really miss Antoinette.

757
01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.640
Let's go!

758
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.560
All of this
took only two and a half months!

759
01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.840
Impressive. Can we go now?

760
01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.960
Your father asked me
to give you a tour of my masterpiece.

761
01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.280
I'm pretty sure all of this was your idea.

762
01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.040
Don't be silly. I'm a humble ant.

763
01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.600
But admit it. it's marvelous.

764
01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.480
- Just like you.
- You want see the interior.

765
01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:09.320
- I should go. Dad...
- It will only take a minute.

766
01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.000
Okay.

767
01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.360
Such splendor. I'm getting goosebumps.

768
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.160
Oh. Mother Nature!

769
01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.160
My love.

770
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.200
- What are you doing?
- For you.

771
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.160
No.

772
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.040
Thank you. but no!

773
01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.720
You!

774
01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.160
You destroyed my singing career!
And sabotaged all of us!

775
01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.480
Singing career?
What exactly did I sabotage?

776
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.480
A band that dies with the first star?

777
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.920
I'd stick to the real world. "bug."

778
01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.120
Move!

779
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.720
Let me go!

780
01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.200
You can't leave me.
I built this house for us!

781
01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:23.760
I can't leave you
because we were never together!

782
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.200
That's only true in your head. my darling!

783
01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.720
What the scarab
is wrong with you. blondie?

784
01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.600
I'm golden!

785
01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:43.080
Enjoy our brand new house. darling.

786
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:05.480
My dear crickets. we know
that each procession is as fast

787
01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.240
as its slowest participant.

788
01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.640
Maybe we should take a break.

789
01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.920
No. I've got to find Antoinette!

790
01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.000
This is awkward!

791
01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.280
Golden ant...

792
01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:21.760
What on earth is that hideous pile?

793
01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.000
Ket?

794
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.160
Antoinette?

795
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.360
What are you doing here?

796
01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.920
- You were right. I'm a fool--
- Ket!

797
01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.560
I appreciate it. but can you get me out?

798
01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.680
Of course!

799
01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.560
- I've really missed you.
- I know.

800
01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.720
Winter's coming!

801
01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.360
Nettie!

802
01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:13.960
- Hey. Antoinette!
- You guys are so cute it makes me sick.

803
01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.360
Stop!

804
01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:25.160
If my calculations are right.
we've got exactly ten seconds before--

805
01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.600
Centrifuge!

806
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.280
Not so fast!

807
01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.120
- I need to tell you something...
- I have to admit...

808
01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.640
- You left...
- I ruined your performance!

809
01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:51.120
- I don't care about...
- Music is your top priority!

810
01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.360
I care about you!

811
01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.480
- I wasn't myself!
- I missed you.

812
01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.600
- Your face. your voice.
- I'm sorry.

813
01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.880
You need to know.

814
01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:22.200
It's now or never.
Regardless of my career and your singing...

815
01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.400
I love you.

816
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.840
I know.

817
01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.440
I can't really sing.

818
01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.480
It was all thanks to my Raspberry Hat.

819
01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.920
Nettie. that's not true.

820
01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.920
That was your voice all along.

821
01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.800
Come along now. lovebirds.

822
01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.080
No!

823
01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.440
It's still fresh and delicious.

824
01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:00.360
I always knew it was your voice.

825
01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.160
- Really?
- Yes.

826
01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.160
I knew this would happen.

827
01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.240
When you have a builder megalomaniac--

828
01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.600
My Nettie!

829
01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:11.880
Mom?

830
01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.120
Anthony!

831
01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.520
Mom!

832
01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:25.000
Don't tell me
you haven't noticed the resemblance?

833
01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.720
You did it.

834
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.280
I'm so proud of you. my little Nettie.

835
01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.840
Daddy!

836
01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.080
- The crickets destroyed my masterpiece!
- Come.

837
01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.640
Come with me. son.

838
01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:50.160
Crickets on ice!

839
01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.880
Silence!

840
01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:02.360
- Is that...
- Impossible. Is that Queen Ant?

841
01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:07.600
Should we bow? Recite the national anthem?
What are we supposed to do? What?

842
01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.760
My dear fellow ants!

843
01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:17.439
We have always been marvelous builders.

844
01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:20.920
but we forgot something very important.

845
01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:25.279
The walls are not here
to separate us from the world!

846
01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:30.160
They are here
to protect us from bad weather

847
01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:33.200
and to unite us all!

848
01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:39.960
Therefore. I'm proud
to pronounce this all-inclusive music hall

849
01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:43.760
open!

850
01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.600
- Music hall? What does that mean?
- She went bonkers.

851
01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:11.760
I present my pride and joy.
the heiress to my throne.

852
01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.520
and first singing ant. Antoinette!

853
01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.319
Antoinette!

854
01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.200
Mom. are those crickets?

855
01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:29.080
Anthal. stop pointing!

856
01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:44.000
The Crickets are invading!

857
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.319
First protocol!

858
01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:48.240
This is the end. Second protocol!

859
01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:54.320
Everything is okay!
Nothing will fall apart!

860
01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:06.560
If they don't listen to your words.
maybe they'll listen to your song.

861
01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:15.920
<i>Dreaming free all summer long
Here and there. a simple song</i>

862
01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:20.680
<i>- Drumming and some yelling too</i>
- We can sing!

863
01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.480
<i>- Busking. wasting time</i>
- She can.

864
01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.560
<i>Like a good old fashioned slackers</i>

865
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.280
<i>- Spending all that lovely weather</i>
- Beautiful!

866
01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:31.800
<i>On a tune or two</i>

867
01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:36.360
- Makes me wanna jump.
<i>- Not thinking about hunger or cold</i>

868
01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.600
<i>What is life without the music?</i>

869
01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.720
<i>- You should tell me more</i>
- Oh. Nature! Oh. Rhythm!

870
01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:46.960
<i>You should tell me more</i>

871
01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.480
<i>What is life without the music?</i>

872
01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.800
Anteodor. wait! Wait for daddy!

873
01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.960
<i>You should tell me more</i>

874
01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.920
<i>And the song will come along...</i>

875
01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:07.200
They sound like Toni and the Crickets.
But would they play at the anthill?

876
01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.360
I can't believe it either.
But one thing I know...

877
01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:13.080
Where there's music. there is also fun!

878
01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:20.480
<i>You should tell me more</i>

879
01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:24.520
<i>And the song will come along
Like a cherry on the top</i>

880
01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:30.560
<i>You should tell me more</i>

881
01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:33.320
<i>What is life without the music...</i>

882
01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.160
My masterpiece is being violated
by this horrible music and dancing!

883
01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.560
They don't deserve me.

884
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.480
Should we go back inside?

885
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.800
The stars will start to fall.

886
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.320
