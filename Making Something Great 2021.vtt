to do too much with his menu.

00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:43.400
Not from around here. are you?

182
00:07:43.533 --> 00:07:46.633
Just passing through.
or trying.

183
00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:48.567
You know you can honk
your horn at them. right?

184
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.467
I tried that.

185
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.834
[horn honking]

186
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.333
Maybe your horn
has more authority.

187
00:07:57.934 --> 00:07:59.834
[engine starting]

188
00:08:07.533 --> 00:08:09.800
[phone ringing]

189
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.166
Hey Becca.

190
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.467
Hey Abby. how's Lawrence?

191
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.633
Well. we haven't
gotten there yet.

192
00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:19.033
We got stuck in a bit of...
local traffic.

193
00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:20.200
Okay. I'll call ahead

194
00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.467
and let them know
you'll be a little late.

195
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.066
When you said this place
was a hidden gem.

196
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.367
did you mean it
was literally hidden?

197
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.633
Okay. so we may have
overly compensated.

198
00:08:27.767 --> 00:08:30.233
Look. we think Rocko's is
the perfect trial balloon.

199
00:08:30.367 --> 00:08:31.700
So just give it a chance.

200
00:08:31.834 --> 00:08:33.533
Trial balloon?

201
00:08:33.667 --> 00:08:35.667
As in the canary in a coal mine?

202
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.200
By the way. the show is now.
Abby On The Road.

203
00:08:38.333 --> 00:08:40.533
You'll only be there
for a week. or two.

204
00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:42.500
or maybe a month. Who knows?

205
00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:44.734
Exciting. right?

206
00:08:44.867 --> 00:08:46.467
Very exciting.

207
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.233
Oh come on Abby. chin up.

208
00:08:48.367 --> 00:08:49.967
This is right up your alley.

209
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.333
Have fun.

210
00:08:51.467 --> 00:08:53.133
Yes. thank you Becca.

211
00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:55.567
Okay. bye.

212
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.934
Thank you.

213
00:09:06.066 --> 00:09:08.066
So what happened.
are we canceled?

214
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.967
No. I just completely
lost track of my show.

215
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.633
I don't even know
what it is anymore.

216
00:09:13.767 --> 00:09:17.033
It's like they want me
out of my element.

217
00:09:17.166 --> 00:09:18.200
Then we should've
got some footage

218
00:09:18.333 --> 00:09:20.200
of you and those sheep.

219
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.300
You looked completely
out of your element.

220
00:09:24.433 --> 00:09:26.667
Okay. try the horn again.

221
00:09:28.233 --> 00:09:29.667
[long horn honk]

222
00:09:30.934 --> 00:09:33.800
There see. you just
gotta do it with authority.

223
00:09:34.867 --> 00:09:37.133
You get rid of the sheep
next time.

224
00:09:40.433 --> 00:09:43.133
[car radio playing]

225
00:09:55.667 --> 00:09:57.300
It's cute.

226
00:09:57.433 --> 00:09:59.266
Michelin five star it is not.

227
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.300
But I bet they do a heck
of a cheeseburger and fries.

228
00:10:02.433 --> 00:10:04.500
You and your fried foods!

229
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.033
[crash]

230
00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:17.800
[laughter and applause]

231
00:10:17.934 --> 00:10:19.400
That was the matinee.

232
00:10:19.533 --> 00:10:22.467
Come back at six
for the double-feature.

233
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.467
What is going on out here?

234
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.300
Oh. well hello... again.

235
00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:33.400
Hello.

236
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.133
Glad to see that the sheep

237
00:10:36.266 --> 00:10:38.433
didn't take up too
much of your time.

238
00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:40.600
How can I help you ladies?

239
00:10:40.734 --> 00:10:41.734
Wait. you work here?

240
00:10:41.867 --> 00:10:43.934
Yeah. it's kind of my place.

241
00:10:44.066 --> 00:10:45.100
Rocko's is your place?

242
00:10:45.233 --> 00:10:47.133
Last I checked. yeah.

243
00:10:47.266 --> 00:10:49.033
Tommy. you want me to
take over the kitchen

244
00:10:49.166 --> 00:10:50.900
so you two can get a booth?

245
00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:54.767
This is Kenna. I'm Abby.

246
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.333
Nice to see you again.

247
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.767
Can I get you some food?

248
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.500
Oh. maybe later.

249
00:11:00.633 --> 00:11:02.200
Thank you. but we'd better
get started.

250
00:11:02.333 --> 00:11:03.600
Get started on what?

251
00:11:03.734 --> 00:11:05.133
The makeover.

252
00:11:05.266 --> 00:11:06.333
I don't know what
you're talking about.

253
00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:08.800
The restaurant makeover show?

254
00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:11.700
You don't recognize her from TV?

255
00:11:11.834 --> 00:11:13.100
I don't watch too much TV.

256
00:11:13.233 --> 00:11:15.266
I'm kind of busy at the diner
a lot of the time.

257
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.934
Plus. I mean aren't all
those shows

258
00:11:17.066 --> 00:11:19.433
like lame reality shows now.
anyway?

259
00:11:19.567 --> 00:11:22.100
Well. I'm sorry to tell you.
but we are going to be making

260
00:11:22.233 --> 00:11:24.834
one of those lame
reality TV shows.

261
00:11:24.967 --> 00:11:26.367
Oh...

262
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.500
What are you talking about?

263
00:11:28.633 --> 00:11:33.667
Tommy. she's here because
I signed us up for her show.

264
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.200
What?

265
00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:38.133
Abby's Restaurant Takeover.

266
00:11:38.266 --> 00:11:41.266
She does restaurant makeovers
and I think we could need one.

267
00:11:43.166 --> 00:11:44.767
So you did this
without consulting me?

268
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.300
Can I talk in the kitchen
for a second?

269
00:11:46.433 --> 00:11:47.700
No.

270
00:11:47.834 --> 00:11:50.300
I know you own the place.
but I am the eldest member

271
00:11:50.433 --> 00:11:53.433
of the Billings family
and I made a decision.

272
00:11:53.567 --> 00:11:55.000
Tommy. you are my
favorite nephew--

273
00:11:55.133 --> 00:11:56.934
-Your only nephew.
-Don't interrupt!

274
00:11:57.066 --> 00:11:58.200
Yes ma'am.

275
00:11:58.333 --> 00:11:59.800
You've done a good job
with this diner. sweetie.

276
00:11:59.934 --> 00:12:02.266
But everyone needs a
little help sometimes.

277
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.233
That sounds familiar...

278
00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:06.033
Besides. what are you
going to do?

279
00:12:06.166 --> 00:12:07.700
You going to fire me?

280
00:12:07.834 --> 00:12:10.266
I'm the best wait staff
you've got.

281
00:12:15.567 --> 00:12:18.533
Okay. we're off
to a great start.

282
00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:20.066
Yeah.

283
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.433
Listen...

284
00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:23.600
I'm here to help.

285
00:12:23.734 --> 00:12:26.266
The good news is I am
pretty good at my job.

286
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.567
I bet you are.

287
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.767
I just need a little time
to think this over.

288
00:12:43.333 --> 00:12:45.900
Okay. so I just want you
to come through...

289
00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:49.734
We've got a shot of you
looking at the restaurant...

290
00:12:49.867 --> 00:12:51.834
And maybe just
checking out the space...

291
00:12:51.967 --> 00:12:53.266
Absolutely.

292
00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:57.967
Maybe sit down
and look comfortable...

293
00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.734
Put a camera here.

294
00:13:00.867 --> 00:13:03.300
Yeah. and then maybe you
could even talk...

295
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.300
It'll be okay.

296
00:13:08.433 --> 00:13:10.266
We need this.

297
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.100
Look. I don't need her help.

298
00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:14.300
Tom Clancy Billings.

299
00:13:14.433 --> 00:13:16.767
Oh really?
Using my full name now?

300
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.533
You are the fabric that
keeps this diner together.

301
00:13:19.667 --> 00:13:22.266
Even the whole town maybe.

302
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.033
But after Linda passed.
you seem to be stuck

303
00:13:25.166 --> 00:13:27.467
doing the same thing.

304
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.100
It's time to shake things up.

305
00:13:30.233 --> 00:13:32.700
Look. my parents ran
the same diner for years.

306
00:13:32.834 --> 00:13:33.867
Okay?

307
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.033
It worked for them.
it works for me too.

308
00:13:36.166 --> 00:13:38.467
Your parents ran a diner
out of necessity.

309
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.300
They weren't natural
born chefs. you are.

310
00:13:43.367 --> 00:13:46.800
The whole town could see
how much potential you have.

311
00:13:46.934 --> 00:13:49.433
I just don't understand
why you can't.

312
00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:52.734
There's nothing wrong with
running a traditional diner.

313
00:13:52.867 --> 00:13:54.066
The regulars seem to like it.

314
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.700
Sure. maybe it's
not flashy. but...

315
00:13:59.567 --> 00:14:01.433
I need this stability
for Claire.

316
00:14:02.567 --> 00:14:07.033
Honey. you are
an amazing father.

317
00:14:07.166 --> 00:14:09.867
And you can still be
that same great father

318
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.633
by chasing your own dreams.

319
00:14:12.767 --> 00:14:15.266
Make this place a destination.

320
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.367
Plus she's cute.

321
00:14:20.667 --> 00:14:22.367
[laughing]

322
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.700
Well of course.

323
00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:28.100
She's pretty cute.

324
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.100
Look. I just don't have the--

325
00:14:31.233 --> 00:14:33.266
You don't have the time
to date. I know.

326
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.834
-I know!
-Okay. well...

327
00:14:35.967 --> 00:14:39.467
But couldn't you just
open yourself up a little bit?

328
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.800
Be good to yourself.

329
00:14:40.934 --> 00:14:42.433
For my own sanity. okay?

330
00:14:42.567 --> 00:14:45.300
Oh okay. I'll do it
for your sanity.

331
00:14:45.433 --> 00:14:47.633
And you be a gracious host.

332
00:14:47.767 --> 00:14:49.734
Make them feel at home.

333
00:14:53.734 --> 00:14:55.934
We could do something
with these tiles...

334
00:14:57.467 --> 00:14:58.734
Thank you.

335
00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:02.767
Excuse me. I'm Abby Brooks and--

336
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.533
Oh hey. I know who you are.

337
00:15:04.667 --> 00:15:06.734
I've watched your show
on food and wine.

338
00:15:06.867 --> 00:15:08.066
Nice to meet you.

339
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.033
What're you doing in
our neck of the woods?

340
00:15:10.166 --> 00:15:12.900
We're looking to do a show
here about Rocko's.

341
00:15:13.033 --> 00:15:14.734
Do you mind if I ask
you a few questions?

342
00:15:14.867 --> 00:15:17.000
Yeah sure. have a seat.

343
00:15:20.233 --> 00:15:21.500
This is my director. Kenna.

344
00:15:21.633 --> 00:15:22.834
Hi.

345
00:15:22.967 --> 00:15:25.867
So what do you think
this place could improve on?

346
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.233
It's okay. Bill.

347
00:15:29.367 --> 00:15:31.100
They're here on our side.

348
00:15:32.834 --> 00:15:35.900
Well I've known Tommy
since he was a boy.

349
00:15:36.033 --> 00:15:39.066
I used go fishing with him
and his dad every weekend.

350
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.734
Tommy was always so proud
of being from Lawrence

351
00:15:42.867 --> 00:15:45.166
and proud of his diner.

352
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.367
that's all he ever talked about.

353
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.900
All he ever wanted to.

354
00:15:48.033 --> 00:15:51.400
And he's kept his promise
to his dad beautifully.

355
00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:56.000
I guess if I was to pick
one thing to improve on...

356
00:15:56.133 --> 00:15:57.767
Tommy's a real good chef.

357
00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.600
I think he could make this place
more his own. you know?

358
00:16:03.734 --> 00:16:04.967
How was that?

359
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.000
It was good.

360
00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.467
You know. Bill here made
his family farm his own

361
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.133
by being the first
organic grower in the region.

362
00:16:12.266 --> 00:16:15.233
long before it
became fashionable.

363
00:16:15.367 --> 00:16:17.266
That's great. Bill.

364
00:16:18.967 --> 00:16:21.667
Hey dad. I went by Bill's
and picked up our order.

365
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.433
Look at the size of these beets.

366
00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:25.333
Wow. those are beautiful.

367
00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:27.333
Not as beautiful
as my Claire Bear.

368
00:16:27.467 --> 00:16:28.967
I was thinking we could
add a light summer salad

369
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.500
to the menu?

370
00:16:30.633 --> 00:16:34.000
Spinach with fresh red onions?

371
00:16:34.133 --> 00:16:36.166
Top it off with a
basil vinaigrette?

372
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.667
That's a nice idea.

373
00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:40.934
Oh my gosh. it's you!

374
00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:42.233
You're here!

375
00:16:42.367 --> 00:16:43.500
Yes I am.

376
00:16:43.633 --> 00:16:44.834
I'm Claire.

377
00:16:44.967 --> 00:16:46.567
Me and Aunt Marge watch
your show every Thursday.

378
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.967
It's part of the girls night.

379
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.333
Oh. you're so sweet.

380
00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:51.934
Well I'm very excited
to meet you

381
00:16:52.066 --> 00:16:53.900
and be here and get to work.

382
00:16:54.033 --> 00:16:54.734
Me too!

383
00:16:54.867 --> 00:16:56.600
Dad. this is so great.

384
00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.567
I have a few ideas.

385
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.700
I'm literally the only person
that didn't know about this?

386
00:17:02.834 --> 00:17:04.300
We thought you'd freak out.

387
00:17:04.433 --> 00:17:06.467
I'm not freaking out.

388
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.633
I'm not!

389
00:17:07.767 --> 00:17:09.467
I'm just surprised.

390
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.567
We are going to send out
these call sheets tonight.

391
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.000
Call sheets?

392
00:17:13.133 --> 00:17:14.734
We'll be here at 6 a.m.
to start shooting the episode.

393
00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.500
Okay yeah. if we do the show.

394
00:17:16.633 --> 00:17:18.066
I still haven't decided.

395
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.333
Tom. I just rode in a rental car
for two days

396
00:17:21.467 --> 00:17:25.133
with my director here who
only played 90's boy bands.

397
00:17:25.266 --> 00:17:27.400
So we're doing the show.

398
00:17:27.533 --> 00:17:30.333
Actually it was
early 2000 boy bands.

399
00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:33.567
which is not important.

400
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.367
Last I checked. I
still own the place.

401
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.633
Come on Tom.

402
00:17:37.767 --> 00:17:39.266
Come on Dad!

403
00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:44.467
Look. just let me
think about it. okay?

404
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.967
My camera crew
will be here at 6 a.m..

405
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.467
so we need to know by then.

406
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.967
You know. Tom wanted to be
an actor when he was a kid.

407
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.567
He'll be a real natural.

408
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.633
I also wanted to be a
professional football player

409
00:17:53.767 --> 00:17:54.867
and an astronaut.

410
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.700
I want to be an astronaut. too.

411
00:17:56.834 --> 00:17:58.200
And a chef.

412
00:17:58.333 --> 00:18:02.400
I'm sure that you will do
whatever you put your mind to.

413
00:18:02.533 --> 00:18:05.367
Tom. I'm here to help.

414
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.900
I'm not the enemy.

415
00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:10.500
See you tomorrow at 6 a.m.?

416
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.066
Goodnight all.

417
00:18:16.667 --> 00:18:17.734
Alright. mister.

418
00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:19.967
Lets get these beets
in the oven.

419
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.567
Don't worry dad.
you'll do the right thing.

420
00:18:27.934 --> 00:18:29.266
Tom. let's go!

421
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.300
Yes ma'am.

422
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.467
Oh wow.
you got a deer plushie?

423
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.867
I didn't get a plushie!

424
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.633
Don't worry.
I won't let it ruin my trip.

425
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.266
Any word from the crew?

426
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.734
Yeah. they just got here.

427
00:18:43.867 --> 00:18:45.734
And the equipment trucks
should arrive in the morning.

428
00:18:45.867 --> 00:18:48.133
So we are good to go.

429
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.066
What's wrong?

430
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.300
Oh nothing.

431
00:18:53.433 --> 00:18:54.867
Your nothing is
always something.

432
00:18:56.066 --> 00:18:57.433
It's just that I'm
used to working with

433
00:18:57.567 --> 00:18:59.533
five-star. big city restaurants.

434
00:18:59.667 --> 00:19:01.133
I have a clear vision.

435
00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:03.300
That guy Tom obviously
doesn't want me here.

436
00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:05.467
And it's stressful
for him and me.

437
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.300
Hey. stop questioning yourself.

438
00:19:07.433 --> 00:19:09.667
You know good food and
you know what people like.

439
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.667
I know what restaurant
city people like.

440
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.667
What's the difference?

441
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.633
Everybody chews
with their teeth.

442
00:19:14.767 --> 00:19:16.600
You know what?
Go out. explore!

443
00:19:16.734 --> 00:19:17.934
Discover what people want

444
00:19:18.066 --> 00:19:20.200
and while you're at it.

445
00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:22.934
discover what your
new show is about.

446
00:19:23.066 --> 00:19:25.000
I knew there was a reason
I've kept you around.

447
00:19:25.133 --> 00:19:26.033
And I'm taking this.

448
00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:27.400
Really?

449
00:19:33.333 --> 00:19:35.066
me what's going on... surl

450
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.533
He's supposed to get here
in ten minutes. but--

451
00:19:37.667 --> 00:19:38.867
Kenna?

452
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.900
Oh Tom. hi!

453
00:19:41.033 --> 00:19:42.633
We're a little light
on crew today.

454
00:19:42.767 --> 00:19:45.333
So I am director. producer.
and PA. it would appear.

455
00:19:45.467 --> 00:19:46.800
Can I get you a coffee. Tom?

456
00:19:46.934 --> 00:19:48.333
It's my diner. we've got coffee.

457
00:19:48.467 --> 00:19:49.367
Can I get you a coffee?

458
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.400
No. I'm good.

459
00:19:50.533 --> 00:19:51.500
Good morning.

460
00:19:51.633 --> 00:19:53.867
-Good morning. Abby.
-Morning. Tom.

461
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
So what're you thinking?

462
00:19:55.133 --> 00:19:57.667
No pressure. but we are
all ready to go.

463
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.633
I'll be honest.

464
00:20:00.767 --> 00:20:02.033
I'm not completely convinced
that we need this makeover

465
00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:05.133
but my beautiful daughter is
and she loves your show.

466
00:20:05.266 --> 00:20:07.166
So let's give this thing a try.

467
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.233
Great. let's try this thing.

468
00:20:09.367 --> 00:20:10.967
Can we get Tom
in hair and make-up?

469
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.700
-Yes.
-Hair and make-up?

470
00:20:12.834 --> 00:20:14.367
We just need you to be a
little more camera ready.

471
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.333
It's all part of the process.

472
00:20:16.467 --> 00:20:18.467
Don't worry. they won't bite.

473
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.266
You're gonna do great.

474
00:20:23.834 --> 00:20:25.367
Hair and make-up?

475
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.233
Okay. so we've got
sound speeding

476
00:20:27.367 --> 00:20:29.333
and we're gonna go
from the intro. Abby.

477
00:20:29.467 --> 00:20:30.734
And action!

478
00:20:30.867 --> 00:20:34.467
Hi. I'm Abby Brooks and
welcome to Abby on the Road.

479
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.233
Where we go to small towns
to find local hidden gems

480
00:20:37.367 --> 00:20:39.700
and give them a
much needed facelift.

481
00:20:39.834 --> 00:20:42.066
I don't know if
it needs a facelift.

482
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.166
A fresh coat of paint and a
few more items on the menu.

483
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.300
But it's a diner.
not a reality housewife.

484
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.467
And this is Tom Billings.

485
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.300
The owner and head chef
here at Rocko's Diner

486
00:20:54.433 --> 00:20:56.500
in Lawrence. Minnesota.
and apparently

487
00:20:56.633 --> 00:20:58.300
an aspiring standup comedian.

488
00:20:58.433 --> 00:21:00.100
Cut!

489
00:21:00.233 --> 00:21:04.200
Okay. great first run you two.

490
00:21:04.333 --> 00:21:06.700
Let's just loosen it up
on this next take.

491
00:21:06.834 --> 00:21:09.367
Maybe pretend that you like
each other a little bit more.

492
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.734
Or a lot more.

493
00:21:12.233 --> 00:21:14.700
Let me just do my intro and
I'll cue you when to talk.

494
00:21:14.834 --> 00:21:17.767
Oh yeah you'll cue me. yeah.

495
00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.300
I just need to do
my introduction.

496
00:21:19.433 --> 00:21:21.433
Then you can tell
your little jokes.

497
00:21:21.567 --> 00:21:23.533
Well you know. the crew laughed.

498
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.734
Kenna. can I talk to you
for a second?

499
00:21:26.867 --> 00:21:28.033
A word?

500
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.533
Can you tell him to
just let me do my thing?

501
00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:36.567
I think he's trying to sabotage
the whole shoot.

502
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.700
I think you've been watching too
many political thriller movies.

503
00:21:39.834 --> 00:21:41.200
He's great on camera.

504
00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:45.233
You know the camera
loves chemistry. so just flirt.

505
00:21:45.367 --> 00:21:47.400
This is not a show
about finding love.

506
00:21:47.533 --> 00:21:50.533
This is a show about finding
a diamond in the rough.

507
00:21:50.667 --> 00:21:53.266
And now that I said it out loud.
I hear how that sounds.

508
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.800
This is a restaurant
makeover show.

509
00:21:54.934 --> 00:21:57.900
It's a new show and you've
got to get used to it.

510
00:21:58.033 --> 00:22:00.133
Your chemistry is off
the charts.

511
00:22:00.266 --> 00:22:01.867
We just need the audience
to believe

512
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.300
that you actually
like each other.

513
00:22:04.433 --> 00:22:05.667
Think about the show.

514
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.467
Our show.

515
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.433
Okay.

516
00:22:11.233 --> 00:22:14.300
Okay. we're gonna
try that again. and...

517
00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:17.367
Everybody loves the camera.

518
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.900
And action!

519
00:22:19.834 --> 00:22:22.967
Hi. I'm Abby Brooks and
welcome to Abby on the Road.

520
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.700
A show where we go
to small towns

521
00:22:24.834 --> 00:22:26.133
to find local hidden gems.

522
00:22:26.266 --> 00:22:28.600
and give them a much
needed facelift.

523
00:22:28.734 --> 00:22:30.266
I'm here with Tom Billings.

524
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.800
the owner and head chef
of Rocko's Diner.

525
00:22:32.934 --> 00:22:35.033
Head chef? That's fancy.

526
00:22:35.166 --> 00:22:37.667
I should update
my dating profile.

527
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.800
I'm surprised you even
need a dating profile.

528
00:22:40.934 --> 00:22:41.900
Yeah.

529
00:22:43.133 --> 00:22:46.633
Tom. tell us about your diner.

530
00:22:46.767 --> 00:22:48.033
Well...

531
00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:50.300
It's been a staple in
the community for generations.

532
00:22:50.433 --> 00:22:52.033
and I'll prove it to you.

533
00:22:52.166 --> 00:22:54.633
That Rocko's is a diner
like no other.

534
00:22:55.967 --> 00:22:58.100
Yes. I'd love that.

535
00:22:58.233 --> 00:23:00.900
That's the premise of the show.
so you'd be doing me a favor.

536
00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:03.033
Excellent. Cut!

537
00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:04.567
I'm gonna go to my trailer.

538
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.667
You don't have one.

539
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.300
Fine. I'm going
to my diner then.

540
00:23:12.533 --> 00:23:14.433
This isn't working.
I'm going to call Becca.

541
00:23:14.567 --> 00:23:17.166
It's new. you just
have to get used to it.

542
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.233
He's impossible to work with.

543
00:23:19.367 --> 00:23:20.767
You don't have to like him.

544
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.934
You just have to pretend
that you like him.

545
00:23:24.967 --> 00:23:27.166
I'm glad you're getting
your rom-com fix.

546
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.500
but this show has to be better
than the last one.

547
00:23:29.633 --> 00:23:30.734
Think about ratings.

548
00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:32.700
Abby. you've got to be
more patient with him.

549
00:23:32.834 --> 00:23:36.600
If you keep fighting with him.
he'll keep fighting back.

550
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.266
You know what? You're right.

551
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.166
I've dealt with five star chefs.
I can deal with this.

552
00:23:48.367 --> 00:23:50.900
Besides. have you tried
his catering?

553
00:23:51.033 --> 00:23:53.767
Because it is so delicious.

554
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.633
Not helping.

555
00:24:00.066 --> 00:24:02.600
Okay. so we're just gonna
pick up from where we left off.

556
00:24:02.734 --> 00:24:04.934
We're rolling and... action.

557
00:24:05.934 --> 00:24:08.233
Tom. what are we
cooking here today?

558
00:24:08.367 --> 00:24:11.100
It's my mother's famous
Mississippi Meatloaf.

559
00:24:11.233 --> 00:24:12.333
It smells amazing.

560
00:24:12.467 --> 00:24:13.800
So what's in it?

561
00:24:13.934 --> 00:24:17.200
Well. ground up meat.
eggs. and some spices.

562
00:24:18.934 --> 00:24:20.867
Great. sounds good.

563
00:24:23.734 --> 00:24:25.600
Usually I would ask
what's in the dish.

564
00:24:25.734 --> 00:24:26.934
but this is a family recipe.

565
00:24:27.066 --> 00:24:28.967
it's been in Tom's family
for generations.

566
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.333
That's really what you feel
when you come into Rocko's.

567
00:24:32.467 --> 00:24:34.100
Family. Tradition.

568
00:24:34.233 --> 00:24:36.333
And I hope to bring that out
during the renovation--

569
00:24:36.467 --> 00:24:39.633
Yeah. you really need to come
to this place to experience it.

570
00:24:39.767 --> 00:24:42.433
Sometimes we focus
on the Michelin stars

571
00:24:42.567 --> 00:24:43.967
and how to push food
to the limit.

572
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.266
to the point where we don't even
recognize what we're eating.

573
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.233
It's places like this
that make us realize

574
00:24:48.367 --> 00:24:50.100
why food is so important.

575
00:24:50.233 --> 00:24:52.300
Family and community.

576
00:24:52.433 --> 00:24:54.100
Yeah. we don't really need
any Michelin stars.

577
00:24:54.233 --> 00:24:55.767
Just some good home cooking.

578
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.233
Cut.

579
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.333
How bout we take a ten?

580
00:25:01.467 --> 00:25:03.867
Excuse me. could you please
get me a glass of wine?

581
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.800
Water.

582
00:25:05.934 --> 00:25:06.767
Hey...

583
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.467
I'm sorry. that was rude.

584
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.033
Look. all this is kind
of new for me. right?

585
00:25:13.166 --> 00:25:15.467
One day everything is normal
and then all of a sudden

586
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.533
there's a camera crew here
and I've got makeup on my face.

587
00:25:18.667 --> 00:25:19.900
Okay.

588
00:25:20.033 --> 00:25:22.133
It's just this diner
is my heart and soul.

589
00:25:22.266 --> 00:25:24.967
and I just don't feel
comfortable

590
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.900
exploiting it on some show.

591
00:25:28.333 --> 00:25:30.333
Some show?

592
00:25:30.467 --> 00:25:33.567
Like your diner. this show
means everything to me.

593
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.066
And I'm not trying
to exploit you.

594
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.033
I'm legitimately
trying to help you.

595
00:25:38.166 --> 00:25:41.233
Okay... okay. I can see that.

596
00:25:42.867 --> 00:25:46.000
I guess I'm just not good
at asking for help.

597
00:25:46.133 --> 00:25:48.867
Really. I'm just been trying
to carry on my family's legacy

598
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.600
and be a good dad.

599
00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:54.133
That's really sweet.

600
00:25:54.266 --> 00:25:57.033
So yeah. I think
some of my stuff

601
00:25:57.166 --> 00:25:59.667
kinda gets put on the back
burner. just a little bit.

602
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.400
I can tell you're a great dad
just by the way

603
00:26:01.533 --> 00:26:03.233
your daughter's eyes glow
when she looks at you.

604
00:26:03.367 --> 00:26:05.633
And I'm not trying
to change any of that.

605
00:26:05.767 --> 00:26:07.133
That's good to know.

606
00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.467
Your diner is great.

607
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.600
All I want to help you do
is find your own way

608
00:26:12.734 --> 00:26:15.200
of expressing yourself
through your food.

609
00:26:15.333 --> 00:26:16.934
It's obvious to me
everyone wants that for you

610
00:26:17.066 --> 00:26:18.900
including your friend. Bill.

611
00:26:19.033 --> 00:26:21.734
Bill... Bill's our
best customer.

612
00:26:21.867 --> 00:26:24.367
And by the way. I'm pretty sure
the only reason

613
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.600
he comes in here is
to flirt with my aunt.

614
00:26:26.734 --> 00:26:27.767
Yeah. I saw that too.

615
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.767
-You did?
-Yeah.

616
00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.467
Okay. good.

617
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.900
So what do you say?

618
00:26:35.033 --> 00:26:36.967
Shall we take
another run at this?

619
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.633
Okay. I'm in.

620
00:26:39.767 --> 00:26:41.133
But it's still my diner.

621
00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:42.967
It's still my show.

622
00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.533
Touché.

623
00:26:48.367 --> 00:26:50.467
So we're here with Tom's
adorable daughter Claire.

624
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.200
who's going to be helping us
out today. right Claire?

625
00:26:53.333 --> 00:26:55.800
I think my dad does
pretty good without me.

626
00:26:57.367 --> 00:26:58.767
So what are we making?

627
00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.200
We're making my grandma's world
famous Mississippi Meatloaf.

628
00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:04.367
It's the dish that
put Lawrence on the map.

629
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.533
I don't know about that.
but it's pretty darn good.

630
00:27:07.667 --> 00:27:08.800
Great.

631
00:27:08.934 --> 00:27:10.667
Was your mother originally
from Mississippi?

632
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.700
No. not at all.

633
00:27:11.834 --> 00:27:12.934
She never even left Lawrence.

634
00:27:13.066 --> 00:27:15.367
So why Mississippi?

635
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.200
Not sure. she must've a taste
for Southern food. I guess.

636
00:27:18.333 --> 00:27:19.967
She actually invented this.

637
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.166
She just taught it to me
when I was Claire's age.

638
00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.967
and now I'm teaching it to her.

639
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.967
I love that!

640
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.667
So. what's in it?

641
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.934
Oh uh. that's a secret.

642
00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:32.333
Just kidding.

643
00:27:32.467 --> 00:27:34.200
[Laughter]

644
00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.700
I like to start with some ground
corn fed Wagyu beef.

645
00:27:38.834 --> 00:27:40.667
Now you want to
add a little ketchup.

646
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.000
let's get that in there.

647
00:27:42.133 --> 00:27:45.166
Gonna add a pinch of oregano.
pinch of paprika.

648
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.100
Okay now.
don't tell anyone. alright?

649
00:27:48.233 --> 00:27:52.166
Throw in a little chili powder
just to really bring the heat.

650
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.166
Now the real secret lays
in the golden brown crust.

651
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.533
For that. I like to use this
rosemary blended maple syrup.

652
00:27:59.667 --> 00:28:01.400
Wow. do you make that here?

653
00:28:01.533 --> 00:28:03.367
No. I get that from
my dear friend Mrs. May

654
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.600
over at the market place.

655
00:28:04.734 --> 00:28:06.667
She just creates these
magical infusions

656
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.667
with Minnesota's very own
organic maple syrup.

657
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.934
I help him pick out
the best syrups.

658
00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:13.600
I bet you do.

659
00:28:13.734 --> 00:28:15.767
So what else is in there?

660
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.500
Everything's from Lawrence.

661
00:28:17.633 --> 00:28:19.066
I mean. I get my flour
from my neighbor

662
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.333
who grinds it himself.

663
00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:22.934
I get all the organic
vegetables from Bill.

664
00:28:23.967 --> 00:28:25.600
Here. try that.

665
00:28:29.333 --> 00:28:31.600
Oh. that is an
explosion of flavor.

666
00:28:31.734 --> 00:28:33.000
Right?

667
00:28:33.133 --> 00:28:36.367
Bill is the best farmer
and best customer.

668
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.433
So after that. what I like to do
is I fry up the garlic.

669
00:28:39.567 --> 00:28:41.367
all the vegetables.

670
00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.867
I throw in a little breadcrumbs.

671
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.200
some Worcestershire sauce.
and then once it cools down.

672
00:28:47.333 --> 00:28:49.867
you just want to layer
that into the meat.

673
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.500
Then you form it in your pan.

674
00:28:53.633 --> 00:28:56.233
throw it in the oven at
400 degrees for 55 minutes.

675
00:28:56.367 --> 00:28:57.533
That sounds so good.

676
00:28:57.667 --> 00:28:58.667
It's the best.

677
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.266
So when do I get a taste?

678
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.567
I actually made one for you.

679
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.166
Oh. that looks amazing.

680
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.033
I am so excited to try a bite.

681
00:29:16.934 --> 00:29:18.734
Oh.

682
00:29:18.867 --> 00:29:20.767
That is out of this world.

683
00:29:22.533 --> 00:29:24.233
There's more where
that came from.

684
00:29:26.467 --> 00:29:27.934
And cut!

685
00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:29.734
That's a great
first day. everyone.

686
00:29:29.867 --> 00:29:31.166
Okay. call sheets
will go out tonight.

687
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.000
Expect to be here
at 6 am on Monday.

688
00:29:34.133 --> 00:29:35.467
And have a good weekend.

689
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.800
You did so good.

690
00:29:37.934 --> 00:29:39.000
Thank you.

691
00:29:39.133 --> 00:29:40.433
To be honest. I was
a little bit nervous.

692
00:29:40.567 --> 00:29:42.900
Oh yeah I could tell.
then you became more yourself.

693
00:29:43.033 --> 00:29:45.266
Oh good. thanks
for your honesty.

694
00:29:46.433 --> 00:29:47.667
Abby. this is so great.

695
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.467
I can't believe you're here
and we're on your show.

696
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.233
When is it going to be on TV?

697
00:29:51.367 --> 00:29:53.233
Don't know. but I will
give you plenty of notice

698
00:29:53.367 --> 00:29:55.000
so that you can get all
your friends to watch.

699
00:29:55.133 --> 00:29:56.567
That would be awesome.

700
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.900
Just keep working on my dad.

701
00:29:58.033 --> 00:30:00.166
I know he'll get a lot better.

702
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.000
Hey. I thought I did
pretty good.

703
00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.233
You were great!
Really. you're a natural.

704
00:30:04.367 --> 00:30:06.066
See? Thank you.

705
00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.300
Hey Abby. what are you
doing this weekend?

706
00:30:08.433 --> 00:30:09.934
I don't know.
probably just working

707
00:30:10.066 --> 00:30:11.333
and watching some movies
with Kenna.

708
00:30:11.467 --> 00:30:13.133

My mom always had to
stay on him about it.

So he finds this fishing line
in the boat

816
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.700
and he fastens it
around her finger

817
00:34:48.834 --> 00:34:52.734
and he tells her that he finally
caught the one that he loves.

After she passed. I just...

830
00:35:24.567 --> 00:35:27.266
I didn't feel like dating
after we lost her.

831
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.100
So I just kind of honed in
on Claire and the restaurant.

832
00:35:31.233 --> 00:35:34.367
I didn't know she passed away.
I'm so sorry.

Thank you.

834
00:35:36.433 --> 00:35:39.133
Trust me. she lives on
through Claire.

835
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.600
That's the downside of living
in a small town

836
00:35:43.734 --> 00:35:45.233
is that everybody
knows everybody.

837
00:35:45.367 --> 00:35:47.633

838
00:35:47.767 --> 00:35:49.633

opposite problem.

there are so many people

842
00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.767
that dating is stressful.

843
00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.800
And I'm like you. work
takes up all of my time.

844
00:35:58.934 --> 00:36:00.367
That I get.

845
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.200
But I mean. you love
the show. right?

846
00:36:02.333 --> 00:36:04.967
And you know.
you're pretty good at it.

847
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:09.133
Well thank you.
I'll take that as a compliment.

848
00:36:09.266 --> 00:36:10.500
Yeah. I love the show.

849
00:36:10.633 --> 00:36:13.266
it's just not what I'd
envisioned for myself.

850
00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.300
I started off as a chef
and I love being a chef.

851
00:36:17.433 --> 00:36:19.700
But then I met my ex
and he had all these ties

852
00:36:19.834 --> 00:36:21.100
to the TV and culinary world.

853
00:36:21.233 --> 00:36:23.834
and he kept pushing for me
to be a TV show host.

854
00:36:23.967 --> 00:36:26.166
Before I knew it.
I had my own show.

855

It was very exciting. but
it wasn't really my dream.

860
00:36:38.133 --> 00:36:39.633
Then cook more!

If you ever decide
to ditch showbiz.

I might know a guy
who owns a diner that

00:36:50.066 --> 00:36:54.066
might be interested in hiring
a lovely lady such as yourself.

here next week.

that I put on.

It's to help raise money
for the volunteer firefighters.

00:37:45.133 --> 00:37:46.200
Need some help?

886
00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.767
Oh. thanks dear.

887
00:37:51.066 --> 00:37:53.233
It's been really fun.
thank you for having me over.

888
00:37:53.367 --> 00:37:54.433
It was my pleasure.

889
00:37:54.567 --> 00:37:56.600
You're a sweet girl
and my niece Claire

890
00:37:56.734 --> 00:37:58.667
cannot stop talking about you.

891
00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.934
She's a doll.

892
00:38:00.133 --> 00:38:02.333
She's really bonded with you.

893
00:38:02.467 --> 00:38:05.333
Tom doesn't usually let people
get close enough to do that.

894
00:38:05.467 --> 00:38:07.233
I think you're winning him over.

895
00:38:08.367 --> 00:38:09.633
Really?

896
00:38:09.767 --> 00:38:13.800
Well he's a great guy
and she is so special.

897
00:38:13.934 --> 00:38:15.834
She's going to do great things.
I can feel it.

898
00:38:15.967 --> 00:38:17.533
You're right about that.

899
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.567
I'm just glad you're here
and I know Tom is too.

900
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.133
Good.

901
00:38:25.266 --> 00:38:26.667
You just keep pushing him.

902
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.967
He'll keep pushing back.
but that's when you know

903
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.900
you're making something great.

904
00:38:32.867 --> 00:38:34.600
I like that perspective.

905
00:38:34.734 --> 00:38:36.066
And don't worry.
I'm going to keep pushing

906
00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.767
so the diner reaches
its full potential.

907
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.600
Oh. the diner will be fine.

908
00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:40.934
I'm talking about pushing Tom

909
00:38:41.066 --> 00:38:43.767
to be a better
version of himself.

910
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.734
Thank you for making me
feel so welcome.

911
00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:50.266
Absolutely. sweetheart.

912
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.333
Anyone who comes to
Aunt Marge's house is family.

913
00:39:02.266 --> 00:39:05.767
[phone ringing]

914
00:39:08.166 --> 00:39:09.533
Hey Becca.

915
00:39:09.667 --> 00:39:10.867
Hey Abby. are you busy?

916
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.033
Nope!

917
00:39:12.166 --> 00:39:13.367
Just wanted to call and tell you

918
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.867
that I've been
watching the dailies

919
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.533
and I have to say you and Tom
have some real chemistry.

920
00:39:17.667 --> 00:39:19.033
Oh. that's good.

921
00:39:19.166 --> 00:39:21.734
It was a rough start. but I
think we're making progress.

922
00:39:21.867 --> 00:39:25.333
I was wondering if you could
lean into that a little bit.

923
00:39:25.467 --> 00:39:26.667
Lean into what?

924
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.133
The chemistry. the flirting.

925
00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:30.834
It's camera gold!

926
00:39:30.967 --> 00:39:32.333
You should've been an actress.

927
00:39:32.467 --> 00:39:34.734
Becca. I'm doing a food show.
not The Bachelorette.

928
00:39:34.867 --> 00:39:36.066
Besides. it's more than that.

929
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.367
He's a really good chef.

930
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.066
Alright. listen.

931
00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.400
The network is considering

932
00:39:40.533 --> 00:39:42.333
doing two restaurants
per episode.

933
00:39:42.467 --> 00:39:44.000
So what does that mean?

934
00:39:44.133 --> 00:39:45.800
It means less time
at each restaurant.

935
00:39:45.934 --> 00:39:47.066
Shorter shoots.

936
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.200
And it frees you up
to do more locations.

937
00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:51.367
But the good news is.
you'll be leaving Lawrence

938
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.934
a week earlier and
heading down to Tulsa.

939
00:39:55.333 --> 00:39:58.533
Oh. so I'm leaving soon?

940
00:39:58.667 --> 00:39:59.867
You sound upset.

941
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.133
I thought you'd be happy

942
00:40:01.266 --> 00:40:02.900
to be spending
less time in Lawrence.

943
00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:04.133
I need more time.

944
00:40:04.266 --> 00:40:06.066
I can't wrap a week early.

945
00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.533
Look I love that
you're a perfectionist.

946
00:40:08.667 --> 00:40:11.367
but just think of
this as the pilot.

947
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.567
We may not even air it.

948
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.300
We'll just use it
as proof of concept.

949
00:40:14.433 --> 00:40:16.467
Becca. I really wish I was
involved in these decisions.

950
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.300
You know how much I care
about my show.

951
00:40:18.433 --> 00:40:20.000
And now I care about
these people. too.

952
00:40:20.133 --> 00:40:22.200
I understand. but at
the end of the day

953
00:40:22.333 --> 00:40:24.567
this is the network's show.
and they want what they want.

954
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.667
As my friend. let me stay
through their fundraiser.

955
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.033
It'll make a great finale.

956
00:40:28.166 --> 00:40:30.033
Trust me. we can
sell them the show

957
00:40:30.166 --> 00:40:32.967
based on this one episode alone.
I will make it pop!

958
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.867
Okay. I'll see if I can
hold the network off.

959
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.200
But Abby. this better
be worth it.

960
00:40:38.333 --> 00:40:40.500
It will be.

961
00:40:40.633 --> 00:40:41.667
Bye.

962
00:40:46.166 --> 00:40:47.533
Good morning!

963
00:40:47.667 --> 00:40:48.633
Where's the camera crew?

964
00:40:48.767 --> 00:40:50.133
Oh. we don't shoot every day.

965
00:40:50.266 --> 00:40:51.800
Plus. today is a
big renovation day.

966
00:40:51.934 --> 00:40:53.500
Oh yeah. we can hear that.

967
00:40:53.633 --> 00:40:56.700
We're giving you a fresh.
modern look with exposed brick.

968
00:40:56.834 --> 00:40:58.800
Oh. love it! I think...

969
00:40:59.934 --> 00:41:01.433
I have something I want
to show you guys.

970
00:41:01.567 --> 00:41:02.900
Oh. what?

971
00:41:03.033 --> 00:41:05.867
I can't tell you Claire Bear.
it's a surprise.

972
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.200
Follow me.

973
00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:08.867
Okay.

974
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.967
Close your eyes! Both of you.

975
00:41:11.367 --> 00:41:13.800
Okay. you're not going to dump
water on our heads. are you?

976
00:41:13.934 --> 00:41:15.967
No. keep your eyes closed!

977
00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.400
-They're closed.
-I promise.

978
00:41:18.533 --> 00:41:20.367
Okay. open up.

979
00:41:22.934 --> 00:41:23.900
Wow.

980
00:41:25.333 --> 00:41:27.900
Okay. where did you get that?

981
00:41:28.033 --> 00:41:29.266
Your Aunt Marge.

982
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.200
And I had it blown up.

983
00:41:31.333 --> 00:41:33.200
Thought it would set the tone
for the new look.

984
00:41:33.333 --> 00:41:34.567
Really make the place pop.

985
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.567
That's from the first time
we re-opened the diner.

986
00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:37.600
Look at us!

987
00:41:37.734 --> 00:41:39.567
Check out you and your dad.

988
00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.967
He loved the idea of you two
doing this together.

989
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.700
(Claire)
I remember papa.

990
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.800
It's also the first time
he saw his name in lights.

991
00:41:47.934 --> 00:41:49.734
That was Tommy's idea.

992
00:41:49.867 --> 00:41:52.133
It was originally named
the Penny Diner.

993
00:41:52.266 --> 00:41:53.700
No idea why.

994
00:41:53.834 --> 00:41:56.266
That's just the name it was
when my dad bought the place.

995
00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.033
Now when I took over.
I wanted to honor him.

996
00:41:59.166 --> 00:42:01.800
Believe it or not. his real name
was Theodore Billings.

997
00:42:01.934 --> 00:42:03.834
So you think he
would've went by Ted?

998
00:42:03.967 --> 00:42:06.934
No. my grandaddy worked
in the local quarries

999
00:42:07.066 --> 00:42:10.967
and he nicknamed his son. Rocko.

1000
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.934
That's what everybody
knew him as.

1001
00:42:13.066 --> 00:42:15.867
Big Rocko. that's my dad.

1002
00:42:17.934 --> 00:42:21.066
We put up that sign
and here we stand.

1003
00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.200
Your dad must've thought
the world of you.

1004
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.700
Both your parents.

1005
00:42:27.834 --> 00:42:31.500
They'd be so impressed with your
dedication to their legacy.

1006
00:42:31.633 --> 00:42:33.266
Thanks Abby.

1007
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.000
They were absolutely great.
both of them.

1008
00:42:37.133 --> 00:42:38.700
After the renovation is done.

1009
00:42:38.834 --> 00:42:41.266
you will get to
continue that dream.

1010
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.266
And I imagine Claire here
is going to make you

1011
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.433
one great sous chef!

1012
00:42:44.567 --> 00:42:48.033
I was thinking I'd be
a great head chef.

1013
00:42:48.166 --> 00:42:50.500
Oh really. you gonna push
the old man out already. huh?

1014
00:42:50.633 --> 00:42:52.867
You told me I have to reach
for the stars. Daddio.

1015
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.600
I did.

1016
00:43:03.567 --> 00:43:05.000
We made big points
with that photo.

1017
00:43:05.133 --> 00:43:06.834
I knew they'd love it.

1018
00:43:06.967 --> 00:43:08.834
Congratulations.

1019
00:43:08.967 --> 00:43:10.533
You're wearing sneakers?

1020
00:43:10.667 --> 00:43:12.567
And your hair is up.

1021
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.934
It's a renovation day
and these are comfortable.

1022
00:43:15.066 --> 00:43:16.934
And I didn't have time
to do my hair.

1023
00:43:17.066 --> 00:43:19.166
You always have time
to do your hair.

1024
00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.600
I've missed flights because
you had to do your hair.

1025
00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.667
Hey. don't worry.

1026
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.567
The network will
realize the show's a hit.

1027
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:32.667
I know. I just want to stay
and finish what we started

1028
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.734
before we move on.

1029
00:43:33.867 --> 00:43:35.667
I know you do. but just relax.

1030
00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.600
Everything's going to be fine.

1031
00:43:37.734 --> 00:43:40.333
You're right.
I just need to loosen up.

1032
00:43:40.467 --> 00:43:42.100
So. you have the new schedule?

1033
00:43:42.233 --> 00:43:47.000
Umm... we leave next Tuesday
for Oklahoma.

1034
00:43:47.133 --> 00:43:49.667
I like the sound of Oklahoma.
sounds like a worthy joint.

1035
00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.867
We won't be done yet.

1036
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.900
It's quite evident
that you won't be done yet.

1037
00:43:55.033 --> 00:43:57.266
-Stop it!
-No. you stop it.

1038
00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.033
I've seen you with Tom.

1039
00:43:59.166 --> 00:44:00.633
Oh. come on.

1040
00:44:00.767 --> 00:44:03.667
Abby Brooks is so afraid of love
she can't even talk about it?

1041
00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.767
I'm not in love!

1042
00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.467
Do I think he's cute? Yes.

1043
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.433
Do I think a lot
of guys are cute?

1044
00:44:09.567 --> 00:44:10.800
Yes.

1045
00:44:10.934 --> 00:44:13.233
I haven't actually heard
you talk about men in general.

1046
00:44:13.367 --> 00:44:15.300
Let alone them being cute.

1047
00:44:15.433 --> 00:44:16.400
Admit it!

1048
00:44:16.533 --> 00:44:17.834
Admit what?

1049
00:44:17.967 --> 00:44:19.500
Go ahead...

1050
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.133
Okay. if I lived here maybe
I would go on a date him.

1051
00:44:25.266 --> 00:44:27.600
But I don't and
we're leaving in a week.

1052
00:44:27.734 --> 00:44:29.166
so there's no point.

1053
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.100
I hear you. but aren't you
just a tiny bit curious?

1054
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:37.834
Yeah maybe. but he's not
part of the plan right now.

1055
00:44:37.967 --> 00:44:39.467
No guy is part of
the plan right now.

1056
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.767
I need to turn the show around.
that is the plan.

1057
00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:42.834
The show is the plan.

1058
00:44:42.967 --> 00:44:45.400
Okay. whatever makes you happy.

1059
00:44:45.533 --> 00:44:47.000
But just so you know.

1060
00:44:47.133 --> 00:44:49.800
I think Abby Billings has
a really nice ring to it.

1061
00:44:49.934 --> 00:44:52.133
Alright you. eat these peanuts!

1062
00:44:52.266 --> 00:44:53.834
[phone ringing]

1063
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.633
Hello. Abby Billings-- I mean
Brooks. Abby Brooks.

1064
00:44:57.767 --> 00:44:59.667
Hello. Abby Billings
- I mean Brooks.

1065
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.133
This is Tom Billings.

1066
00:45:02.266 --> 00:45:03.600
Are you still there?

1067
00:45:04.967 --> 00:45:07.000
Yeah. hi!

1068
00:45:07.133 --> 00:45:09.834
I don't have good reception.
so maybe you can't hear me?

1069
00:45:09.967 --> 00:45:12.400
No. I hear you just fine!

1070
00:45:12.533 --> 00:45:15.900
Great. I'm so glad
you can hear me.

1071
00:45:16.934 --> 00:45:18.133
What's up?

1072
00:45:18.266 --> 00:45:20.567
Listen. I was just
thinking about. you know.

1073
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.700
what you said about
expanding the legacy.

1074
00:45:22.834 --> 00:45:25.700
And I was just wondering
if maybe you'd want to

1075
00:45:25.834 --> 00:45:28.000
come over to my place and
preview one of the dishes

1076
00:45:28.133 --> 00:45:30.734
that I was considering
adding to the menu. eventually?

1077
00:45:30.867 --> 00:45:32.200
Listen to you. Tom Billings.

1078
00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:34.400
Change is a'coming.

1079
00:45:34.533 --> 00:45:37.033
So what do you say?

1080
00:45:37.166 --> 00:45:38.900
Yes! Yeah I'd love to. sure.

1081
00:45:39.033 --> 00:45:40.567
That sounds good.

1082
00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:41.567
Okay.

1083
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.300
I'll see you soon.

1084
00:45:43.433 --> 00:45:45.200
Okay. I'll text you the address.

1085
00:45:45.333 --> 00:45:47.066
Great.

1086
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.633
-Bye.
-Bye.

1087
00:45:50.667 --> 00:45:51.900
I don't want to hear it.

1088
00:45:52.033 --> 00:45:53.500
What? You know so much?

1089
00:45:53.633 --> 00:45:56.567
I need to preview a menu
for his new item.

1090
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.834
He's actually listening to me
for once.

1091
00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.200
It's good for the show.

1092
00:46:01.333 --> 00:46:05.433
The show is important!
You are driving me crazy.

1093
00:46:05.567 --> 00:46:07.033
I've gotta go.

1094
00:46:07.166 --> 00:46:10.300
I'll see you later. Cut it out!

1095
00:46:10.433 --> 00:46:11.867
I love you. bye!

1096
00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:25.567
Hi.

1097
00:46:27.934 --> 00:46:29.200
Hi...

1098
00:46:29.333 --> 00:46:31.367
You know. I have a bigger mirror
in the house. right?

1099
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.867
Having a makeup moment.

1100
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.066
You look beautiful.

1101
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.400
Wanna see what
I've been cooking?

1102
00:46:35.533 --> 00:46:36.700
Yes I do.

1103
00:46:36.834 --> 00:46:38.033
Come on in.

1104
00:46:53.333 --> 00:46:55.700
Uh oh. I know that look.

1105
00:46:55.834 --> 00:46:57.533
I hope you left your
makeover hat at the inn.

1106
00:46:57.667 --> 00:46:59.600
Because no notes
on the decor. please.

1107
00:46:59.734 --> 00:47:01.333
No. I really like it!

1108
00:47:01.467 --> 00:47:03.533
It's so homey.

1109
00:47:05.633 --> 00:47:07.500
Although I would get
a different couch.

1110
00:47:07.633 --> 00:47:09.600
I just said no notes!

1111
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.100
Where's Claire?

1112
00:47:14.233 --> 00:47:16.900
It's Thursday. so girls night
over at Aunt Marge's.

1113
00:47:17.934 --> 00:47:19.266
She'll be back later.

1114
00:47:20.767 --> 00:47:23.166
So. what are we
having for dinner?

1115
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.467
Well. let me show you.

1116
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.100
First I'm gonna need
a little bit of your help

1117
00:47:26.233 --> 00:47:27.367
just to finish it.

1118
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.533
Oh. that's why you
invited me over?

1119
00:47:29.667 --> 00:47:31.533
You need a sous chef?

1120
00:47:31.667 --> 00:47:33.934
Everyone needs
a sous chef. right?

1121
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.700
[pan sizzling]

1122
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.300
Oh. that smells amazing.

1123
00:47:43.433 --> 00:47:45.767
Wait until I bake it
with the cheese and sauce.

1124
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.100
Potatoes are already
in the oven.

1125
00:47:47.233 --> 00:47:48.967
I can't wait!

1126
00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.433
Should I just throw these
right into the sauce?

1127
00:47:51.567 --> 00:47:53.367
That's a nice idea.

1128
00:47:54.233 --> 00:47:55.700
Oh. I am so sorry!

1129
00:47:55.834 --> 00:47:57.433
Are you okay? Did I burn you?

1130
00:47:57.567 --> 00:47:58.467
No. not at all.

1131
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.834
-Oh. I feel terrible.
-Well don't.

1132
00:48:00.967 --> 00:48:02.066
Listen. keep an eye
on the sauce.

1133
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.500
Gonna go change my shirt
real quick.

1134
00:48:03.633 --> 00:48:06.834
Because I cannot be entertaining
you looking like this.

1135
00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:09.300
Okay? I'll be right back.

1136
00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.166
♪

1137
00:48:31.166 --> 00:48:33.266
Ah. there you are.

1138
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.700
What are you doing in here?

1139
00:48:34.834 --> 00:48:36.333
Sorry. I saw these
when I came in.

1140
00:48:36.467 --> 00:48:38.333
Did you draw these?

1141
00:48:38.467 --> 00:48:41.834
Yeah just. you know.
some doodling.

1142
00:48:41.967 --> 00:48:43.367
No. it's not doodling.

1143
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.667
These are full blown
restaurant designs.

1144
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.500
-I love them.
-You do?

1145
00:48:46.633 --> 00:48:47.700
Yeah and this menu.

1146
00:48:47.834 --> 00:48:49.867
It's simple. but elegant.

1147
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.767
Well. you know.
I dream sometimes.

1148
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.200
I... guess it's a hobby.

1149
00:48:55.333 --> 00:48:56.533
Well if it's just a hobby.

1150
00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:58.633
it's because you're
making it that way.

1151
00:48:59.867 --> 00:49:01.533
Guilty as charged.

1152
00:49:03.467 --> 00:49:05.934
You are full of secrets.
Tom Billings.

1153
00:49:06.066 --> 00:49:08.266
No. I'm not trying
to keep any secrets.

1154
00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.667
But I will let you in
on one secret?

1155
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.000
What's that?

1156
00:49:12.133 --> 00:49:13.467
I don't like burning my sauces
for chicken parm.

1157
00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.233
so dinner is served. my lady.

1158
00:49:15.367 --> 00:49:17.000
Oh. thank you. kind sir.

1159
00:49:17.133 --> 00:49:18.667
After you.

1160
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.066
-That doesn't sound good.
-Wow.

1161
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.033
Okay. here we are.

1162
00:49:34.166 --> 00:49:37.200
My personal recipe
for Chicken Parmesan

1163
00:49:37.333 --> 00:49:40.367
with roasted rosemary potatoes
and steamed spinach.

1164
00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.433
Oh. it smells so good!

1165
00:49:42.567 --> 00:49:43.934
I still have yet to try it.

1166
00:49:44.066 --> 00:49:45.767
And wait until you try that
Portobello tomato sauce

1167
00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.633
that you helped me make.

1168
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.467
Oh Tom. that is divine.

1169
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.567
Yeah?

1170
00:49:54.934 --> 00:49:57.567
Thank you. that means a lot
coming from someone

1171
00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:00.100
with your culinary pedigree.

1172
00:50:00.233 --> 00:50:01.967
You can knock it off.

1173
00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.734
Really. it's delicious.

1174
00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:05.533
So when are you going
to add it to the menu?

1175
00:50:05.667 --> 00:50:07.867
Oh uh. soon-ish.

1176
00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:12.700
Look. I just don't think
it's diner food.

1177
00:50:12.834 --> 00:50:15.867
Who decides what
diner food is. anyway?

1178
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.300
I guess I do.

1179
00:50:20.667 --> 00:50:23.867
I just don't think that
my patrons are ready for it.

1180
00:50:24.934 --> 00:50:26.800
Not ready for chicken?

1181
00:50:26.934 --> 00:50:28.467
Yeah. I mean if you
want that kind of cuisine

1182
00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.900
you just go to the Italian place
across town. right?

1183
00:50:31.033 --> 00:50:32.133
So what are you saying?

1184
00:50:32.266 --> 00:50:34.467
That only steak restaurants
can serve steak?

1185
00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.900
No. what I'm saying
is that Rocko's people

1186
00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:39.033
just probably wouldn't order it.

1187
00:50:39.166 --> 00:50:40.700
Hey. Mr. Stubborn?

1188
00:50:40.834 --> 00:50:42.533
You never know till you try.

1189
00:50:42.667 --> 00:50:43.867
Test market it.
put it on the menu.

1190
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.133
If no one orders it.
you have your answer.

1191
00:50:46.266 --> 00:50:47.767
Maybe.

1192
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.900
Or maybe we'll just save it
for Tom's Place.

1193
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.367
If that ever happens.

1194
00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.200
See. there you go again.

1195
00:50:55.333 --> 00:50:58.767
Tom's Place is a great idea
and you can make it happen.

1196
00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:00.700
You could do it.

1197
00:51:00.834 --> 00:51:03.100
And in the meantime. you could
be serving this dish right now.

1198
00:51:03.233 --> 00:51:05.100
I think people will love it.

1199
00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:10.133
Are you flirting?

1200
00:51:10.266 --> 00:51:12.867
Even though the cameras are off?

1201
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.433
I wasn't flirting!

1202
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.433
Okay...

1203
00:51:18.133 --> 00:51:20.200
Okay. maybe I was.

1204
00:51:20.333 --> 00:51:21.734
Just a little bit.

1205
00:51:24.433 --> 00:51:26.867
And if you do open Tom's Place.

1206
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.967
then I'd have to come back
to shoot another episode.

1207
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.367
We're home!

1208
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.266
I didn't quite
expect them this early.

1209
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.367
Hey. Daddio.

1210
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.467
Geez Louise. that wind's
really kicked up.

1211
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.967
I think we're in for one.

1212
00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.533
Hi...

1213
00:51:48.667 --> 00:51:51.433
Sorry I know we're early.
but I thought I should

1214
00:51:51.567 --> 00:51:53.767
get her home before
the heavens opened up.

1215
00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.967
We had a jump on
building that ark.

1216
00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.033
[laughing]

1217
00:51:57.166 --> 00:51:59.200
We were just finishing up.

1218
00:51:59.333 --> 00:52:01.533
What? Is this a date
or something?

1219
00:52:01.667 --> 00:52:03.600
-No--
-Not a date.

1220
00:52:03.734 --> 00:52:05.600
Okay. it's just
that other than Claire.

1221
00:52:05.734 --> 00:52:06.934
I've never seen a girl here.

1222
00:52:07.066 --> 00:52:08.033
Okay.

1223
00:52:08.166 --> 00:52:09.433
What?

1224
00:52:09.567 --> 00:52:11.934
It's just shocking. that's all.

1225
00:52:12.066 --> 00:52:14.066
Abby. can you help me
with my dessert?

1226
00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.667
Well. of course!

1227
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.934
Great. okay.

1228
00:52:17.066 --> 00:52:19.900
It's my take on the
classic upside down cake.

1229
00:52:20.033 --> 00:52:21.900
Oh. fancy!

1230
00:52:22.033 --> 00:52:23.800
Let's get the oven started!

1231
00:52:26.333 --> 00:52:29.000
You want to step out on
the balcony for a moment?

1232
00:52:29.133 --> 00:52:32.834
Yeah. it's such a beautiful
night for something like that.

1233
00:52:45.667 --> 00:52:46.800
So?

1234
00:52:48.233 --> 00:52:49.567
What are we doing?

1235
00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.333
Nothing.

1236
00:52:51.467 --> 00:52:53.100
You're quiet...

1237
00:52:53.233 --> 00:52:54.166
So?

1238
00:52:55.166 --> 00:52:56.667
Sometimes people are quiet.

1239
00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.767
Yeah people are quiet.
you're not.

1240
00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.467
What're we doing out here?

1241
00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.233
Was it a date?

1242
00:53:02.367 --> 00:53:03.600
No.

1243
00:53:03.734 --> 00:53:05.300
Look. I knew you were bringing
Claire home tonight.

1244
00:53:05.433 --> 00:53:07.633
Why would I want her
to sit in on a date?

1245
00:53:07.767 --> 00:53:09.433
It looked like one.

1246
00:53:09.567 --> 00:53:11.800
I just wanted her to try
some of my new chicken parm

1247
00:53:11.934 --> 00:53:14.100
and give me some
feedback. that's all.

1248
00:53:14.233 --> 00:53:15.967
Oh. I see.

1249
00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.300
So you had to light
some candles.

1250
00:53:18.433 --> 00:53:20.233
play some music for that?

1251
00:53:22.033 --> 00:53:24.166
Look. just say what
you want to say.

1252
00:53:25.567 --> 00:53:26.934
I like her.

1253
00:53:27.066 --> 00:53:28.400
That's all.

1254
00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.567
Me too.

1255
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.433
But...

1256
00:53:36.567 --> 00:53:39.266
No buts. Never need buts.

1257
00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.166
But she's going
to be going soon.

1258
00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:42.734
Who knows?

1259
00:53:42.867 --> 00:53:46.800
The way you two come off. they
might give you a show together.

1260
00:53:46.934 --> 00:53:48.400
Oh. I doubt that.

1261
00:53:48.533 --> 00:53:51.834
Although we would make a
great team for the show.

1262
00:53:51.967 --> 00:53:53.400
Isn't it worth a shot?

1263
00:53:55.433 --> 00:53:57.200
Marge. I just met the girl.

1264
00:53:58.567 --> 00:53:59.567
I'm not ready.

1265
00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.467
I've been listening
to that for years.

1266
00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.233
According to you.
you'll never be ready.

1267
00:54:05.367 --> 00:54:06.934
That's not true.

1268
00:54:09.967 --> 00:54:11.967
Look how happy she looks.

1269
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.967
She could use a woman
in her life.

1270
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.400
She's got you.

1271
00:54:19.533 --> 00:54:22.066
Stop trying to sell me. okay?

1272
00:54:24.967 --> 00:54:26.834
When it's right. it'll be right.

1273
00:54:26.967 --> 00:54:28.333
I don't want to drag Claire
into something

1274
00:54:28.467 --> 00:54:30.133
unless I know that it's real.

1275
00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:33.000
You know what I'm talking about.

1276
00:54:33.133 --> 00:54:35.867
And how does anyone know
when it's for real?

1277
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.867
You just gotta take that chance.

1278
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.066
Real love always finds a way.

1279
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.834
So you came up with this recipe
all by yourself?

1280
00:54:46.967 --> 00:54:48.967
Well it's actually
Aunt Marge's recipe.

1281
00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:51.300
but I changed a lot
of things around.

1282
00:54:51.433 --> 00:54:53.300
That is what I've been
trying to get your dad to do

1283
00:54:53.433 --> 00:54:55.033
with your family recipes.

1284
00:54:55.166 --> 00:54:56.533
He's stubborn.

1285
00:54:56.667 --> 00:54:58.400
I noticed.

1286
00:54:58.533 --> 00:55:01.033
But he usually
comes around eventually.

1287
00:55:01.166 --> 00:55:02.266
Trust me.

1288
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.467
I do.

1289
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.033
So does your dad bake with you?

1290
00:55:07.166 --> 00:55:08.433
Not really.

1291
00:55:08.567 --> 00:55:11.667
He always says that baking
was more my mom's thing.

1292
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.467
Well I'm glad to be baking
with you now.

1293
00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.700
Me too.

1294
00:55:18.934 --> 00:55:20.667
Oh. what just happened?

1295
00:55:22.033 --> 00:55:24.100
Power went out.
Is everybody okay?

1296
00:55:24.233 --> 00:55:25.600
Yeah. just a little shocked.

1297
00:55:25.734 --> 00:55:27.333
Welcome to Lawrence.

1298
00:55:31.166 --> 00:55:33.533
Thankfully we have a gas oven.

1299
00:55:33.667 --> 00:55:36.400
I couldn't see. I hope
the crust is golden enough?

1300
00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:39.767
Young lady it's going to be
perfect. because you made it.

1301
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:41.367
Alright. I'm digging in.
You ready?

1302
00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:42.834
Yeah. me too.

1303
00:55:46.767 --> 00:55:48.100
Wow!

1304
00:55:48.233 --> 00:55:50.033
Claire. well done honey.

1305
00:55:50.166 --> 00:55:51.633
Really?

1306
00:55:51.767 --> 00:55:53.900
And I love the blackberries.

1307
00:55:54.033 --> 00:55:55.734
See? I told you they'd like it.

1308
00:55:55.867 --> 00:55:57.367
I want to be like Abby
when I grow up.

1309
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.967
Have my own TV show
and share my cake recipes

1310
00:56:00.166 --> 00:56:02.000
with people all over the world.

1311
00:56:02.133 --> 00:56:04.266
Okay. so you want
to be an astronaut.

1312
00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.367
a TV show host and a chef?

1313
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.767
Yeah. so?

1314
00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.300
Do it!

1315
00:56:09.433 --> 00:56:12.700
Like I said. I think you can do
whatever you put your mind to.

1316
00:56:12.834 --> 00:56:15.767
Hey!

1317
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.433
You know what? On that note.

1318
00:56:17.567 --> 00:56:18.934
I have had a wonderful time

1319
00:56:19.066 --> 00:56:21.800
but I should probably get going
before the next downpour.

1320
00:56:21.934 --> 00:56:23.633
I'll give you a lift.
I'm heading that way.

1321
00:56:23.767 --> 00:56:25.133
That would be great. thanks.

1322
00:56:25.266 --> 00:56:26.533
I'll walk you both out.

1323
00:56:26.667 --> 00:56:28.533
I'll go get the car.

1324
00:56:31.066 --> 00:56:33.667
That was so delicious
and so much fun.

1325
00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:34.800
Thanks for all that help.

1326
00:56:34.934 --> 00:56:36.133
Those were some great tips.

1327
00:56:36.266 --> 00:56:37.266
Good night. Abby.

1328
00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.900
Good night sweetheart.

1329
00:56:40.834 --> 00:56:42.166
Thank you.

1330
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.333
I'll clean this up.

1331
00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:45.567
Thanks. sweetie.

1332
00:56:55.934 --> 00:56:57.100
Thanks for coming.

1333
00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.400
I ate way too much.
it was so good.

1334
00:57:01.533 --> 00:57:03.500
I better see that dish
on the menu.

1335
00:57:03.633 --> 00:57:04.667
We'll see.

1336
00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.600
I had a great time.

1337
00:57:08.734 --> 00:57:10.000
Yeah. me too.

1338
00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:13.867
[horn honks]

1339
00:57:18.467 --> 00:57:19.834
Your aunt sure has great timing.

1340
00:57:19.967 --> 00:57:22.266
She does. doesn't she?

1341
00:57:23.867 --> 00:57:25.200
See you tomorrow?

1342
00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:27.467
See you tomorrow.

1343
00:57:29.166 --> 00:57:30.000
Good night.

1344
00:57:30.133 --> 00:57:30.934
Night.

1345
00:57:48.667 --> 00:57:50.333
How'd it go?

1346
00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:51.667
How'd what go?

1347
00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:52.934
Your date.

1348
00:57:54.166 --> 00:57:55.567
It wasn't a date.

1349
00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:57.300
So what do you call it?

1350
00:57:58.667 --> 00:58:00.133
Dinner.

1351
00:58:00.266 --> 00:58:02.934
Well. did she like your dinner?

1352
00:58:03.066 --> 00:58:04.100
Yeah. she did actually.

1353
00:58:04.233 --> 00:58:06.066
She actually really
liked the chicken.

1354
00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.100
She thinks I should
put it on the menu.

1355
00:58:08.233 --> 00:58:09.734
-That's a good sign.
-Yeah.

1356
00:58:10.567 --> 00:58:12.934
But do you like her?

1357
00:58:14.934 --> 00:58:17.000
Yeah. I like her.

1358
00:58:17.133 --> 00:58:18.800
I like her too.

1359
00:58:18.934 --> 00:58:20.266
That's good.

1360
00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.734
You know. she's really nice.

1361
00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:29.333
Look. Claire Bear...

1362
00:58:31.767 --> 00:58:34.667
You know how much
I love you. right?

1363
00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.433
You're the most important
person in my life.

1364
00:58:37.567 --> 00:58:39.433
And I...

1365
00:58:39.567 --> 00:58:42.300
I know how much you miss mom.

1366
00:58:42.433 --> 00:58:44.467
And I do too. okay?

1367
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:46.467
And although I see it in you
every single day.

1368
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:50.166
I miss her smile.
and I miss her laugh.

1369
00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.367
I miss her silly sense of humor.

1370
00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.300
I miss her cooking.

1371
00:58:55.433 --> 00:58:56.667
You're a great cook.

1372
00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.166
Thanks.

1373
00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:01.233
Look honey. I know this
has been a tough time

1374
00:59:01.367 --> 00:59:02.734
for both of us. okay?

1375
00:59:02.867 --> 00:59:05.734
But look we've always had
each other to lean on. right?

1376
00:59:07.467 --> 00:59:09.467
And look. othing would
make me happier

1377
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.200
than to have someone else
in our life right now

1378
00:59:11.333 --> 00:59:14.400
that we could just share
our lives with.

1379
00:59:14.533 --> 00:59:17.734
And I promise you I will
make that happen...

1380
00:59:19.934 --> 00:59:21.100
Eventually.

1381
00:59:23.633 --> 00:59:25.734
So what's wrong with Abby?

1382
00:59:25.867 --> 00:59:28.300
Nothing's wrong with Abby.
I think.

1383
00:59:31.166 --> 00:59:33.633
Well. do you love her?

1384
00:59:33.767 --> 00:59:34.633
Do I love her?

1385
00:59:34.767 --> 00:59:35.900
Uh...

1386
00:59:37.333 --> 00:59:38.800
It's a little early
for that. sweetheart.

1387
00:59:38.934 --> 00:59:42.433
I mean we just met. plus
she's leaving in a week or so.

1388
00:59:43.533 --> 00:59:47.667
Listen. how about we just keep
her as a really good friend?

1389
00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:48.967
Okay?

1390
00:59:50.633 --> 00:59:52.734
I don't know.
we'll see where it goes.

1391
00:59:54.467 --> 00:59:55.600
Deal?

1392
00:59:56.667 --> 00:59:57.633
Deal.

1393
00:59:58.667 --> 01:00:00.166
Come here.

1394
01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.400
We'll always have each other.
Claire Bear.

1395
01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:04.467
I love you.

1396
01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.133
Love you too.

1397
01:00:15.734 --> 01:00:17.033
How was your date?

1398
01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.867
It wasn't a date.

1399
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.767
You were at his house!

1400
01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:25.133
You were eating food together.
but it wasn't a date?

1401
01:00:25.266 --> 01:00:26.700
You and I eat food together
all the time.

1402
01:00:26.834 --> 01:00:28.300
I wouldn't exactly call
that a date.

1403
01:00:28.433 --> 01:00:30.800
And his daughter
and his aunt were there.

1404
01:00:30.934 --> 01:00:33.934
So you're getting to know
his family? Nice!

1405
01:00:34.066 --> 01:00:36.667
Kenna. we've been shooting
with them for what? A week?

1406
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.266
And I went to a cookout
at his house.

1407
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.300
Is any of this ringing a bell?

1408
01:00:40.433 --> 01:00:41.500
You're no fun.

1409
01:00:41.633 --> 01:00:42.800
What do you want to know?

1410
01:00:42.934 --> 01:00:44.667
That I had a good time?

1411
01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.800
That Claire is talented
and inspiring

1412
01:00:48.934 --> 01:00:52.500
and Tom is sweet and handsome

1413
01:00:52.633 --> 01:00:56.033
and I love spending time
with him and his family?

1414
01:00:57.233 --> 01:00:59.700
It looks like both of us
got our answer.

1415
01:01:08.367 --> 01:01:10.266
What are you doing here?

1416
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.333
Overseeing the reno.

1417
01:01:12.467 --> 01:01:13.700
Doesn't look like
that's what you're doing.

1418
01:01:13.834 --> 01:01:14.900
What's in the pan?

1419
01:01:15.033 --> 01:01:17.066
A local chef gave me
an incredible recipe.

1420
01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.533
and I wanted to see if
your diners might like it.

1421
01:01:19.667 --> 01:01:21.100
Just some local chef. huh?

1422
01:01:21.233 --> 01:01:22.433
And who might that be?

1423
01:01:22.567 --> 01:01:23.867
Doesn't matter.

1424
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.667
Do you think they're ready
to elevate their palates?

1425
01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.467
No. I don't.

1426
01:01:31.233 --> 01:01:33.200
Feel confident about that?

1427
01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:36.033
About as confident as you
feel in your heels.

1428
01:01:36.166 --> 01:01:38.333
Okay. let's make a bet.

1429
01:01:38.467 --> 01:01:40.166
If half of them like
your chicken parm.

1430
01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.900
it goes on the menu.

1431
01:01:42.033 --> 01:01:43.200
You in?

1432
01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:46.934
Yeah. I'll take that bet.

1433
01:01:47.066 --> 01:01:48.533
It's on!

1434
01:01:50.533 --> 01:01:52.533
How many people would
like to try a fancy.

1435
01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:54.700
probably overrated
chicken parmesan?

1436
01:01:54.834 --> 01:01:56.700
Yeah. gimme some here.

1437
01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.667
Wow.

1438
01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.600
Okay. I had no idea we had so
many Italophiles on our hands.

1439
01:02:02.734 --> 01:02:03.800
I don't know what that
big word means.

1440
01:02:03.934 --> 01:02:05.967
but I love me some
good chicken parm.

1441
01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.934
Why didn't you say anything?

1442
01:02:08.066 --> 01:02:11.700
Well. we all know you can be
a little stubborn there. Tommy.

1443
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.066
Okay....

1444
01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.100
Me? Stubborn? No...

1445
01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.000
Hey. what are you laughing at?

1446
01:02:21.133 --> 01:02:22.900
Still feeling that confident?

1447
01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:32.633
Tommy. this dish
is off the chain.

1448
01:02:32.767 --> 01:02:34.000
Really?

1449
01:02:35.567 --> 01:02:37.500
Alright. well message
received loud and clear.

1450
01:02:37.633 --> 01:02:39.266
Chicken parm stays on the menu.

1451
01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.667
Yeah!

1452
01:02:42.467 --> 01:02:45.500
Tom... bad news.

1453
01:02:45.633 --> 01:02:47.834
All those steaks we ordered
for the fundraiser...

1454
01:02:47.967 --> 01:02:51.400
They've been held up.
they won't be here by tomorrow.

1455
01:02:51.533 --> 01:02:52.767
Cut!

1456
01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.066
Sorry. Kenna.

1457
01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.767
It's alright. Marge.
What's the problem?

1458
01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:57.333
There's been some mixup
with our shipment.

1459
01:02:57.467 --> 01:02:59.433
They don't know
where our order is.

1460
01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:01.066
Just have them send us
a new overnight shipment.

1461
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.133
With the storm and stuff?

1462
01:03:02.266 --> 01:03:04.200
They'll never
make it by tomorrow.

1463
01:03:04.333 --> 01:03:05.667
Well what's left in the freezer?

1464
01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:06.900
Not enough. and besides.

1465
01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:09.000
what else would we serve
on Monday?

1466
01:03:11.333 --> 01:03:12.667
Okay.

1467
01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.533
Look. I know we have a lot
of filming left to do today.

1468
01:03:14.667 --> 01:03:16.333
but I've got to
take care of this.

1469
01:03:16.467 --> 01:03:17.567
I already sold 30 tickets

1470
01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.500
and I don't know
what I'm gonna do yet.

1471
01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.367
Hey Bill. what's ripe
at your place?

1472
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.133
Heirlooms are looking
pretty good.

1473
01:03:26.266 --> 01:03:27.633
What else?

1474
01:03:27.767 --> 01:03:29.166
Why don't you come out
and have a look?

1475
01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:30.266
Yeah.

1476
01:03:31.767 --> 01:03:33.333
I'm thinking five years of
working in vegetarian joints

1477
01:03:33.467 --> 01:03:35.667
might come in handy
right about now.

1478
01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.700
Okay. well I'm in.

1479
01:03:37.834 --> 01:03:39.066
Great.

1480
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.166
Hey. where are you going?

1481
01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:41.367
We're already behind schedule

1482
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.133
and Becca wants us
to travel on Sunday.

1483
01:03:43.266 --> 01:03:44.166
Let me handle this.

1484
01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.734
You load up the crew
and follow us.

1485
01:03:46.867 --> 01:03:49.400
Go get 'em girl.
we'll be right behind you.

1486
01:03:55.433 --> 01:03:57.767
Take a look at these zucchinis.

1487
01:04:02.166 --> 01:04:03.100
There you go.

1488
01:04:03.233 --> 01:04:04.367
That's a beauty.

1489
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.800
Got any egg plant?

1490
01:04:05.934 --> 01:04:07.700
It's your lucky day.

1491
01:04:12.667 --> 01:04:15.400
Okay yeah. I could make a
nice ratatouille out of this.

1492
01:04:15.533 --> 01:04:16.967
As long as I can
convince the townsfolk

1493
01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:19.400
that they're
eating vegetable stew.

1494
01:04:19.533 --> 01:04:20.633
That sounds great.

1495
01:04:20.767 --> 01:04:22.934
But what am I gonna do
for a main?

1496
01:04:23.066 --> 01:04:25.033
Hey Bill. where are
those heirloom tomatoes

1497
01:04:25.166 --> 01:04:26.033
you were bragging about?

1498
01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:28.367
-Yeah. right over here.
-Great.

1499
01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:31.567
Abby. these ones are special.

1500
01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.934
Oh. that's gorgeous!

1501
01:04:33.066 --> 01:04:34.400
That's my Bill.

1502
01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.066
So what are you thinking?

1503
01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.700
I'm thinking we could
do vegetable lasagnas.

1504
01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:41.600
Layer zucchini.
portobello mushrooms.

1505
01:04:41.734 --> 01:04:44.700
These tomatoes are going
to make a killer sauce.

1506
01:04:44.834 --> 01:04:46.767
You add some ricotta.
parmigiano.

1507
01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:50.467
smother it in mozzarella -
you're a hero.

1508
01:04:51.433 --> 01:04:53.133
Okay. that sounds pretty good.

1509
01:04:53.266 --> 01:04:54.533
We'll take some onions

1510
01:04:54.667 --> 01:04:56.200
and some of your famous
Russian garlic.

1511
01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:57.567
You got it.

1512
01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.700
Can I help make the pasta?

1513
01:04:59.834 --> 01:05:02.633
Claire. you are now
our new sous chef.

1514
01:05:02.767 --> 01:05:04.333
And I started at
vegetarian restaurants

1515
01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:05.533
in the city for five years.

1516
01:05:05.667 --> 01:05:07.166
We can do this.

1517
01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.333
Yeah. we can do this...

1518
01:05:09.467 --> 01:05:10.433
I think.

1519
01:05:11.767 --> 01:05:13.300
I didn't know who you were
or talented you were

1520
01:05:13.433 --> 01:05:14.767
when I met you.

1521
01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.266
You got this.

1522
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.100
We got this?

1523
01:05:18.233 --> 01:05:19.367
[everyone]
We got this!

1524
01:05:22.266 --> 01:05:23.533
Okay. you keep going
with the ratatouille.

1525
01:05:23.667 --> 01:05:25.100
It already smells divine.

1526
01:05:25.233 --> 01:05:26.467
Yes. chef.

1527
01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.967
Oh. it's been so long since
someone called me that.

1528
01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.934
I've really missed it.

1529
01:05:31.066 --> 01:05:33.300
Well. you're killing it.
You haven't skipped a beat.

1530
01:05:33.433 --> 01:05:34.367
Thanks. Tom.

1531
01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.800
Anything else I can do for you?

1532
01:05:35.934 --> 01:05:37.467
Yes. can you throw
these zucchinis in the oven

1533
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.867
with a little olive oil.

1534
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.100
They taste sweeter once
they've been lightly roasted.

1535
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.200
How's this?

1536
01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:45.800
Claire you are a natural.

1537
01:05:45.934 --> 01:05:47.834
but it's no surprise
given your legacy.

1538
01:05:47.967 --> 01:05:49.800
Keep going. just roll it
a little thinner.

1539
01:05:49.934 --> 01:05:51.433
Aye aye. captain.

1540
01:05:51.567 --> 01:05:52.600
Where did you learn that?

1541
01:05:52.734 --> 01:05:54.166
I'm reading Treasure Island.

1542
01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:55.800
Well shiver me timbers.

1543
01:05:58.066 --> 01:05:59.266
Hey listen. I want you
all to know

1544
01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.867
that this lady isn't
just a TV host. okay?

1545
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.600
She single-handedly
saved my charity dinner.

1546
01:06:03.734 --> 01:06:06.266
my restaurant. and me.

1547
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.734
Thanks Tom. I'm touched.

1548
01:06:08.867 --> 01:06:10.834
What. are you auditioning
for your own show?

1549
01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.266
Not a chance.

1550
01:06:15.533 --> 01:06:16.533
Becca?

1551
01:06:16.667 --> 01:06:17.867
Hey Kenna. how's it
going over there?

1552
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.834
Really good. like.
out of this world good.

1553
01:06:19.967 --> 01:06:21.400
So are you guys
flying out tomorrow?

1554
01:06:21.533 --> 01:06:23.533
The dailies are good
and I love the chemistry.

1555
01:06:23.667 --> 01:06:25.166
but it feels a little played out

1556
01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.600
and I'm wondering if
it's time to move on.

1557
01:06:26.734 --> 01:06:28.700
And the advance people
have Tulsa prepped.

1558
01:06:28.834 --> 01:06:30.100
Look. there's something
happening here

1559
01:06:30.233 --> 01:06:32.433
that's much bigger that
you can't get from the dailies.

1560
01:06:32.567 --> 01:06:34.033
I need you to trust us on this.

1561
01:06:34.166 --> 01:06:35.033
It's worth the delay.

1562
01:06:35.166 --> 01:06:36.033
Really?

1563
01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:37.066
What?

1564
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.600
It's more than a format change.

1565
01:06:39.734 --> 01:06:41.533
I'm gonna need a couple
more days.

1566
01:06:42.567 --> 01:06:44.433
Okay. I hope you're right.

1567
01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:46.867
It's really tough for me to do
this when I don't know why.

1568
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.433
Trust. Becca. trust.

1569
01:06:49.567 --> 01:06:50.967
Call me tomorrow.

1570
01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:02.133
-Hello.
-Hi.

1571
01:07:02.266 --> 01:07:03.233
Linda. Larry.

1572
01:07:03.367 --> 01:07:04.266
Welcome.

1573
01:07:05.867 --> 01:07:07.066
I hope they're not disappointed.

1574
01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.934
This tends to be a bigger.
carnivorous affair.

1575
01:07:10.066 --> 01:07:11.767
They're going to love it.

1576
01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.700
Well. they're just not used
to me serving this.

1577
01:07:15.734 --> 01:07:18.600
Think about how receptive
they were to your chicken parm.

1578
01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:20.834
You're right. however.
carnivorous.

1579
01:07:20.967 --> 01:07:22.266
[laughs]

1580
01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.800
You gotta give them more credit.

1581
01:07:23.934 --> 01:07:25.600
More importantly. you've got
to give yourself more credit.

1582
01:07:25.734 --> 01:07:28.100
You are a great chef.
even if you're cooking

1583
01:07:28.233 --> 01:07:30.200
vegetarian entrees
for the first time.

1584
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:32.500
Thank you.

1585
01:07:33.734 --> 01:07:36.433
Remember. everyone here
loves you.

1586
01:07:36.567 --> 01:07:37.533
Everyone?

1587
01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.500
Yes. everyone.

1588
01:07:40.633 --> 01:07:43.667
Now let's get inside so
we can get ready to serve.

1589
01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:45.667
Okay.

1590
01:07:48.433 --> 01:07:49.567
Hello everyone.

1591
01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:51.000
Hey Tom!

1592
01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:53.734
Listen before we dig in.
I just want to thank you all

1593
01:07:53.867 --> 01:07:56.367
for coming to this year's
annual fundraising event.

1594
01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.834
We deeply appreciate all
of your participation

1595
01:08:00.967 --> 01:08:05.700
and just on behalf of all
our volunteer firefighters.

1596
01:08:05.834 --> 01:08:08.233
we thank you. really.

1597
01:08:08.367 --> 01:08:10.066
I've created something
a little different

1598
01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.700
and special for you this year.

1599
01:08:11.834 --> 01:08:14.033
But before we get into that.
I'd really like to introduce

1600
01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:16.533
you all to Abby Brooks from
the Food and Wine Network's

1601
01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:19.066
hit series. Abby's
Restaurant Takeover.

1602
01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.834
Now she's been doing
a makeover at my diner

1603
01:08:20.967 --> 01:08:22.066
for the past week or so.

1604
01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.000
So yes. I hope you
are dressed in your best.

1605
01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:26.533
because her crew is here
and you will be in the show.

1606
01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:29.033
Unless you forgot to sign
a waiver on the way in.

1607
01:08:29.166 --> 01:08:30.533
[laughter]

1608
01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:33.867
I just want to take a second
to tell you all about Abby.

1609
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.033
She's one of the most stubborn
people I've ever met.

1610
01:08:37.166 --> 01:08:38.500
I mean that in a good way.

1611
01:08:38.633 --> 01:08:40.333
You better mean that
in a good way!

1612
01:08:40.467 --> 01:08:41.934
[laughter]

1613
01:08:44.033 --> 01:08:45.233
I do.

1614
01:08:45.367 --> 01:08:47.667
She's just cruising around
my diner doing her thing

1615
01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.533
and it's inspiring.

1616
01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:53.567
Her love for cooking
and for helping people.

1617
01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:54.934
it's infectious.

1618
01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.800
So suffice it to say. this feast
would not have happened

1619
01:08:59.934 --> 01:09:01.100
if it were not for Abby.

1620
01:09:01.233 --> 01:09:02.633
So cheers to Abby.

1621
01:09:02.767 --> 01:09:05.367
[applause]

1622
01:09:07.166 --> 01:09:09.467
Now. what you'll find
on your plates

1623
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.533
is my very own recipe
of ratatouille.

1624
01:09:11.667 --> 01:09:14.734
as well as the main dish. which
is Abby's vegetable lasagna

1625
01:09:14.867 --> 01:09:17.734
and all the pasta has
been made by my Claire Bear.

1626
01:09:17.867 --> 01:09:19.066
Please enjoy! Dig in.

1627
01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.467
[applause]

1628
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.000
Bon appetite!

1629
01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:32.700
Wow!

1630
01:09:32.834 --> 01:09:34.567
This is out of this world. Tom.

1631
01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:35.567
Thank you. Bill.

1632
01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:36.567
Fantastic!

1633
01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:39.400
[phone ringing]

1634
01:09:44.333 --> 01:09:45.266
Becca. hi.

1635
01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.066
Hey Abby. I've got you
on speaker.

1636
01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.467
I'm here with the VPs.

1637
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.867
and they're loving
what they've seen so far.

1638
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.967
Sorry. I don't have
very good reception.

1639
01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.467
I can hardly hear you.

1640
01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.233
I'm here with the network.
and they're loving the dailies

1641
01:09:57.367 --> 01:09:58.734
that Kenna sent yesterday.

1642
01:09:58.867 --> 01:10:01.367
They think the new concept
is gonna work. big time.

1643
01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.700
That's great.
I'm so glad you like it!

1644
01:10:03.834 --> 01:10:04.867
Yeah. it gave us an idea.

1645
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.266
What's that?

1646
01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.533
Well. we really like the
chemistry between you and Tom.

1647
01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:10.066
so we're thinking
we should pair you up

1648
01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.700
with one of our male hosts.

1649
01:10:11.834 --> 01:10:12.800
Oh...

1650
01:10:12.934 --> 01:10:14.066
Yeah. we're thinking
of Marco Bonelli.

1651
01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.066
You know. from
Marco's Sweet Treats.

1652
01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.400
We think the two of you
together will be a home run.

1653
01:10:18.533 --> 01:10:21.767
I have met Marco and I've seen
his show and he's good.

1654
01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.533
but I don't think we
would have any chemistry.

1655
01:10:26.667 --> 01:10:28.800
Abby. if you can have chemistry
with some local chef

1656
01:10:28.934 --> 01:10:33.200
in a small town. imagine what
you could do with a real pro.

1657
01:10:33.333 --> 01:10:34.633
It's not about me
being with a pro.

1658
01:10:34.767 --> 01:10:36.367
it's about who I feel
comfortable with

1659
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.367
and who I have chemistry with.

1660
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.066
I think he's a phony.

1661
01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.700
I'm not suggesting it be force.

1662
01:10:42.834 --> 01:10:44.200
We would of course do a pilot

1663
01:10:44.333 --> 01:10:45.767
to see if there's
anything there.

1664
01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:47.266
Becca. I've happily gone along
with all the network changes.

1665
01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.433
but I'm telling you I
can't work with this guy.

1666
01:10:49.567 --> 01:10:52.400
He's arrogant
and full of himself.

1667
01:10:52.533 --> 01:10:54.734
And I can't just flirt
with anyone.

1668
01:10:56.333 --> 01:10:58.500
I'm not going to put on
an act anymore.

1669
01:10:59.567 --> 01:11:02.600
I'm sorry Abby.
but it's our decision.

1670
01:11:05.734 --> 01:11:09.533
Sorry. I think I'm losing you.

1671
01:11:09.667 --> 01:11:11.166
If you can hear me.
I don't have reception.

1672
01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.133
I'll call you when I get some.

1673
01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:28.166
I told you our food
was going to be a hit.

1674
01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:29.633
Yeah.

1675
01:11:29.767 --> 01:11:31.633
And who's calling who stubborn?

1676
01:11:35.934 --> 01:11:37.633
Well we better get going
on dessert.

1677
01:11:37.767 --> 01:11:38.834
Give the people what they want.

1678
01:11:38.967 --> 01:11:41.500
or more of what they
didn't know they wanted.

1679
01:11:41.633 --> 01:11:44.433
It's fine. I think I can do it
by myself.

1680
01:11:45.667 --> 01:11:47.233
Is everything okay?

1681
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.667
Look. this is almost over.

1682
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.500
You've got the finale
and the big reveal tomorrow

1683
01:11:54.633 --> 01:11:56.700
and then no more act. right?

1684
01:11:58.266 --> 01:12:00.200
What's going on?

1685
01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:02.266
Look. I've had fun okay?

1686
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.533
I really hope that
your show turns out well.

1687
01:12:05.667 --> 01:12:07.667
Wait. where did. Tom...

1688
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:08.667
What is...?

1689
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:26.600
What's going on?

1690
01:12:26.734 --> 01:12:28.266
You didn't say anything
all the way home.

1691
01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.500
What's wrong?

1692
01:12:32.033 --> 01:12:33.533
I don't know.

1693
01:12:33.667 --> 01:12:35.066
Is it Tom?

1694
01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.900
I don't know what happened.

1695
01:12:37.033 --> 01:12:39.467
He suddenly got cold and
then he wouldn't to talk to me.

1696
01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.433
Well. we're pretty much done
with the remodel.

1697
01:12:41.567 --> 01:12:43.600
You don't have to see him
again after tomorrow.

1698
01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:45.200
On top of that. Becca
wants to partner me up

1699
01:12:45.333 --> 01:12:48.367
with that jerk. Marco Bonelli
for a new show.

1700
01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:49.533
Where did that land?

1701
01:12:49.667 --> 01:12:51.100
Somewhere up in the air.
as usual.

1702
01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:56.700
We'll figure that out.
I'm just so confused about Tom.

1703
01:12:56.834 --> 01:12:58.367
What did I say?

1704
01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.433
What did I do?

1705
01:12:59.567 --> 01:13:00.700
Oh honey...

1706
01:13:00.834 --> 01:13:02.633
You can't plan love.

1707
01:13:02.767 --> 01:13:05.967
If it was meant to be.
then it would've worked out.

1708
01:13:12.266 --> 01:13:16.300
So. today is the
big reveal episode.

1709
01:13:17.633 --> 01:13:18.767
Yeah.

1710
01:13:22.066 --> 01:13:24.767
Should be nice to see
what they do to the diner?

1711
01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:25.867
Yeah.

1712
01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.667
Tommy. what happened?

1713
01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:32.834
Nothing.

1714
01:13:32.967 --> 01:13:34.367
Show's over today
and then we can go back

1715
01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:37.233
to living our normal lives
once again.

1716
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:39.967
What's wrong?

1717
01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.367
What happened between
the two of you?

1718
01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:43.834
I was right about her.

1719
01:13:43.967 --> 01:13:45.967
She's just a big city girl
who cares about her TV show.

1720
01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:48.633
What're you talking about?

1721
01:13:48.767 --> 01:13:51.567
She was playing us to get
her TV show done.

1722
01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.667
She seemed sincere to me.

1723
01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.266
Well. she wasn't.

1724
01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.867
I overheard her on
the phone last night

1725
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.433
and it was very clear that
she is done putting up the act

1726
01:14:02.567 --> 01:14:04.066
of buddying up next to me.

1727
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.600
What did you hear?

1728
01:14:07.233 --> 01:14:09.934
I heard all I needed
to hear. okay?

1729
01:14:10.066 --> 01:14:11.100
I was foolish.

1730
01:14:11.233 --> 01:14:13.200
I brought Claire into this.

1731
01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:15.834
which is the last thing
that I wanted to do.

1732
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.467
And you know what?

1733
01:14:21.233 --> 01:14:24.000
We were starting to feel
like a family.

1734
01:14:25.867 --> 01:14:27.934
You talk to Abby.

1735
01:14:28.066 --> 01:14:31.300
There are two sides
to every story.

1736
01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:37.500
Look. it's clear that we're both
living two different lives.

1737
01:14:37.633 --> 01:14:39.734
Going down two separate paths.

1738
01:14:39.867 --> 01:14:42.166
I hope those two paths
find each other.

1739
01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:45.133
because you two make
a great team.

1740
01:14:47.333 --> 01:14:48.667
Made a great team.

1741
01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:53.033
Thank you.

1742
01:15:06.467 --> 01:15:07.767
Tom. before we get
started filming.

1743
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.467
I want you to know how
much this has meant to me.

1744
01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.166
It's okay.

1745
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.166
Let's just get this show
on the road. huh?

1746
01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:17.333
I'm excited to see what
you've done with my place.

1747
01:15:17.467 --> 01:15:19.800
I really hope you like it.

1748
01:15:19.934 --> 01:15:21.467
I'm sure I will.

1749
01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.333
Okay. picture's up...
and... action!

1750
01:15:26.467 --> 01:15:28.066
I'm here with Tom Billings.

1751
01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:31.900
we're about to reveal the
renovation of his Rocko's Diner.

1752
01:15:32.033 --> 01:15:34.600
When we first got here. we
saw a diner full of potential.

1753
01:15:34.734 --> 01:15:37.100
A diner that was
already well established.

1754
01:15:37.233 --> 01:15:39.633
A diner that was
cherished by the town.

1755
01:15:39.767 --> 01:15:41.633
I'm sorry. can we cut?

1756
01:15:41.767 --> 01:15:43.467
Yeah. cut!

1757
01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:46.066
Abby. are you okay?

1758
01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.800
Yeah. sorry.

1759
01:15:48.934 --> 01:15:49.867
I'm good.

1760
01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:51.967
Can we go again?

1761
01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.233
Yeah.

1762
01:15:53.367 --> 01:15:56.934
Rolling... and... action!

1763
01:15:58.066 --> 01:15:59.633
I'm here with Tom Billings.

1764
01:15:59.767 --> 01:16:02.800
We're about to unveil the
remodel of Rocko's Diner.

1765
01:16:09.266 --> 01:16:10.834
I'm going to be honest with you.

1766
01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:14.900
When we first got to this diner.
I didn't know what I could do.

1767
01:16:15.033 --> 01:16:19.367
The food was great. the people
in town love this place.

1768
01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:22.800
and the owner was deadset
on keeping tradition alive.

1769
01:16:23.867 --> 01:16:25.900
So I thought let's keep
that tradition going

1770
01:16:26.033 --> 01:16:28.233
with a little love and care.

1771
01:16:30.266 --> 01:16:32.633
You ready to see your new diner?

1772
01:16:32.767 --> 01:16:33.567
Yeah.

1773
01:16:41.367 --> 01:16:44.900
I added this beautiful patio to
accommodate dining al fresco.

1774
01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:46.533
It's going to increase
your capacity.

1775
01:16:46.667 --> 01:16:50.300
but it's also going to give
Rocko's a new sense of openness.

1776
01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:55.500
It's just the beginning.

1777
01:16:55.633 --> 01:16:57.667
You should see
what I've done inside.

1778
01:16:58.533 --> 01:16:59.500
Come on.

1779
01:17:19.433 --> 01:17:20.467
Wow.

1780
01:17:22.033 --> 01:17:23.066
Look at these photos.

1781
01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.400
I haven't seen some
of those in so long.

1782
01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:27.900
Oh and the potted herbs. nice.

1783
01:17:28.033 --> 01:17:29.433
I love it.

1784
01:17:29.567 --> 01:17:31.967
I thought it would bring out
the freshness of your new look.

1785
01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:34.066
And here's your new menu.

1786
01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.433
Okay.

1787
01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:38.100
Okay. what do we got?

1788
01:17:38.233 --> 01:17:39.433
Wow. look at this.

1789
01:17:39.567 --> 01:17:42.533
We've got fresh beet salad.
chicken parmesan...

1790
01:17:44.266 --> 01:17:46.133
Vegetable lasagna.

1791
01:17:46.266 --> 01:17:47.567
With your community driven
diner.

1792
01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.767
updated with a more progressive
menu.

1793
01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:51.600
locally sourced produce.

1794
01:17:51.734 --> 01:17:54.400
like from your friend
Bill's organic farm.

1795
01:17:54.533 --> 01:17:56.900
Rocko's can boast
a renewed commitment

1796
01:17:57.033 --> 01:17:58.900
to farm to table cuisine.

1797
01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:03.233
I love it and I think
the town will too.

1798
01:18:04.667 --> 01:18:06.600
It was all part of your dream.

1799
01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.133
This has been Abby on the Road.

1800
01:18:11.266 --> 01:18:12.433
We'll see you next time!

1801
01:18:12.567 --> 01:18:14.367
And remember. you
can find a hidden gem

1802
01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:15.934
just about anywhere.

1803
01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:17.600
All you have to do is look.

1804
01:18:17.734 --> 01:18:19.533
And... cut!

1805
01:18:19.667 --> 01:18:21.900
And that's a wrap everyone.

1806
01:18:22.333 --> 01:18:24.934
We want to thank you so much
for all your hard work.

1807
01:18:25.066 --> 01:18:28.500
And we want to thank Tom
and his beautiful family.

1808
01:18:28.633 --> 01:18:29.767
Thank you.

1809
01:18:31.266 --> 01:18:32.533
Marge!

1810
01:18:33.767 --> 01:18:35.633
Bill. put her there...

1811
01:18:35.767 --> 01:18:38.700
-Bill! You sure look happy.
-Yes. very exciting.

1812
01:18:38.834 --> 01:18:40.266
My Claire Bear.

1813
01:18:43.567 --> 01:18:47.600
I just want to say this has been
such a great experience for me.

1814
01:18:47.734 --> 01:18:49.800
I've done a lot of
restaurant makeovers in my time.

1815
01:18:49.934 --> 01:18:54.066
and I have never met a nicer
or more welcoming group.

1816
01:18:56.266 --> 01:18:57.433
So thank you.

1817
01:18:59.567 --> 01:19:01.000
Can I talk to you for a second?

1818
01:19:01.133 --> 01:19:02.100
Yeah.

1819
01:19:08.467 --> 01:19:11.033
Look. I don't know what happened
between the two of us.

1820
01:19:11.166 --> 01:19:14.500
I thought we were
enjoying each other.

1821
01:19:14.633 --> 01:19:15.934
We were.

1822
01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.500
But something changed.

1823
01:19:19.633 --> 01:19:22.767
I don't know what.
but I'm really sorry it did.

1824
01:19:24.133 --> 01:19:25.266
Yeah me too.

1825
01:19:28.066 --> 01:19:32.100
I need you to know that
whatever is going on here.

1826
01:19:32.233 --> 01:19:35.900
I wasn't flirting
with you for ratings.

1827
01:19:36.033 --> 01:19:40.033
Everything I felt for you.
Claire. Marge.

1828
01:19:40.166 --> 01:19:42.567
the diner. people of Lawrence...

1829
01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.667
It was all one hundred
percent genuine.

1830
01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:50.367
Okay.

1831
01:19:51.734 --> 01:19:54.333
I have something that
I need to tell you.

1832
01:19:54.467 --> 01:19:55.467
What?

1833
01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:00.233
The other night. I accidentally
overheard you on the phone--

1834
01:20:00.367 --> 01:20:01.333
Hi. I'm sorry.

1835
01:20:01.467 --> 01:20:02.934
We've gotta go.

1836
01:20:03.066 --> 01:20:06.133
Our plane is like the only one
that leaves here in two weeks.

1837
01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:08.867
Tom. what...?

1838
01:20:11.467 --> 01:20:12.934
No. she's right.

1839
01:20:13.066 --> 01:20:14.533
You better go.

1840
01:20:17.333 --> 01:20:18.734
Kenna. thank you for
everything you've done.

1841
01:20:18.867 --> 01:20:20.333
No. thank you!

1842
01:20:20.467 --> 01:20:22.367
What you're doing here
is really great.

1843
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.033
They're lucky to have you.
Keep it up!

1844
01:20:29.633 --> 01:20:31.834
She's right.
they're lucky to have you.

1845
01:20:35.133 --> 01:20:36.800
See you when I see you.

1846
01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:39.967
Abby...

1847
01:20:44.734 --> 01:20:45.800
Thank you.

1848
01:20:48.567 --> 01:20:52.033
Oh... look in the kitchen.
I left something for you.

1849
01:21:15.166 --> 01:21:16.967
To the Stubborn Chef...

1850
01:21:19.533 --> 01:21:22.834
These smiles held the promise
of a new beginning.

1851
01:21:22.967 --> 01:21:25.533
You will always be in my heart.

1852
01:21:25.667 --> 01:21:30.433
With all my love to you
and Claire. Abby.

1853
01:21:50.633 --> 01:21:53.600
You still think she's
just flirting for the camera?

1854
01:21:55.834 --> 01:21:57.834
It's just a TV show. Auntie.

1855
01:21:59.266 --> 01:22:00.700
Honey I've seen all
her episodes.

1856
01:22:00.834 --> 01:22:03.200
this was more than a TV show.

1857
01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.467
That girl loves you.

1858
01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.200
Tulsa better have
a better night life.

1859
01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.433
You know. if there's
a two-step bar.

1860
01:22:25.567 --> 01:22:27.734
you're obligated
to be my partner.

1861
01:22:31.066 --> 01:22:32.467
Earth to Abby?

1862
01:22:34.834 --> 01:22:37.100
Kenna. it doesn't
feel right to leave.

1863
01:22:37.233 --> 01:22:38.800
especially like this.

1864
01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:44.800
Lawrence was the first place
that felt like home in so long.

1865
01:22:44.934 --> 01:22:47.400
I really grew to love it.

1866
01:22:47.533 --> 01:22:48.667
And Tom?

1867
01:22:50.533 --> 01:22:52.100
And Tom.

1868
01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:55.533
And Claire. And Marge and Bill.

1869
01:22:58.266 --> 01:23:01.533
Abby if we don't go to Tulsa.
we lose the show.

1870
01:23:05.266 --> 01:23:06.700
Why are you stopping?

1871
01:23:06.834 --> 01:23:08.934
You're not having second
thoughts. are you?

1872
01:23:10.934 --> 01:23:13.633
Our welcoming committee
came to say goodbye.

1873
01:23:16.834 --> 01:23:18.934
This has gotta be
their interstate.

1874
01:23:21.266 --> 01:23:22.767
Hey. where are you going?

1875
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:24.433
To shoo them away.

1876
01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:30.066
The horn still
doesn't work for you?

1877
01:23:37.934 --> 01:23:39.367
You can't leave today.

1878
01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:40.633
Tom. what are you doing here?

1879
01:23:40.767 --> 01:23:42.834
Look. what I was trying
to tell you was that

1880
01:23:42.967 --> 01:23:45.033
I accidentally
overheard you on the phone.

1881
01:23:45.166 --> 01:23:47.967
And I don't care if you think
I'm phony. or if I'm a jerk.

1882
01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:50.633
You can't leave today.
not like this.

1883
01:23:50.767 --> 01:23:53.033
That's what this is about.

1884
01:23:53.166 --> 01:23:54.633
I was talking about
some jerk at the network

1885
01:23:54.767 --> 01:23:58.033
they wanted to pair me up with
that's not going to happen.

1886
01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:00.834
I was actually fighting
to have you as a co-host.

1887
01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:05.233
You would do a show with me?

1888
01:24:05.367 --> 01:24:08.367
If I'm not mistaken.
I think we just did.

1889
01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:11.000
Okay. so you
don't think I'm a jerk?

1890
01:24:12.133 --> 01:24:16.633
I think you are the most
genuine guy I have ever met.

1891
01:24:19.066 --> 01:24:20.533
Look. I don't care
if you live in the city

1892
01:24:20.667 --> 01:24:21.900
and I live in the country.

1893
01:24:22.033 --> 01:24:24.867
And I have no idea how we'd
make this work but...

1894
01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.533
Sorry. you were rambling.

1895
01:24:33.667 --> 01:24:35.700
You kinda make me
do that sometimes.

1896
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.500
Are you two going
to keep this up?

1897
01:24:38.633 --> 01:24:41.133
Because I think the sheep
are getting jealous.

1898
01:24:43.033 --> 01:24:45.333
I actually hired them
to stop you.

1899
01:24:45.467 --> 01:24:46.266
[laughing]

1900
01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.533
I'm just kidding. Maybe.

1901
01:24:48.667 --> 01:24:50.066
Hey. do you want
to come and help me

1902
01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.100
with the dinner rush tonight?

1903
01:24:52.233 --> 01:24:53.934
I would love to.

1904
01:24:54.066 --> 01:24:55.100
Besides. I have a feeling

1905
01:24:55.233 --> 01:24:56.500
we're going to miss
our flight anyways.

1906
01:24:56.633 --> 01:24:58.834
Due to unforeseen traffic.

1907
01:25:02.767 --> 01:25:04.567
Besides. I have a better idea

1908
01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.900
I think I can sell
to the network.

1909
01:25:09.066 --> 01:25:10.200
Okay.

1910
01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.333
And... action!

1911
01:25:15.467 --> 01:25:16.600
Hello. I'm Abby Brooks.

1912
01:25:16.734 --> 01:25:17.734
And I'm Tom Billings.

1913
01:25:17.867 --> 01:25:20.266
And welcome to Hidden Gems!

1914
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.567
It's a show where we seek out
small town restaurant gems.

1915
01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:24.433
like right here in
our lovely own Lawrence.

1916
01:25:24.567 --> 01:25:26.467
and then we teach you how
to recreate one of their most

1917
01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.633
famous dishes right here
at Rocko's Diner.

1918
01:25:28.767 --> 01:25:31.166
This week. we went to a small
Indian restaurant

1919
01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:32.433
just one hour north of Lawrence.

1920
01:25:32.567 --> 01:25:33.900
And we're gonna try
to put our own spin

1921
01:25:34.033 --> 01:25:35.667
on their murgh makhani.

1922
01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:37.066
That's how you say that...

1923
01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.433
And we think you'll love it!

1924
01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:40.767
And... cut!

1925
01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:43.100
Okay great work people.
but we've got to move on.

1926
01:25:43.233 --> 01:25:44.567
Lots to do.

1927
01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:46.800
Indian food. I could go
