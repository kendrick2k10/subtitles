3
00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:14.541
The morning sun slowly bathed
the surroundings in light.

4
00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:20.291
Jessica woke up feeling refreshed
in a camp in the middle of Africa.

5
00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:21.708
She looked around.

6
00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:24.625
the group she traveled with
was still sound asleep.

7
00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:28.000
They were tired from the long trek
through the forest yesterday.

8
00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:33.458
Their two local African guides
were preparing breakfast.

9
00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:36.166
Jessica grabbed her toothbrush

10
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.125
and walked towards
the sound of the nearby stream.

11
00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:43.666
Along the way.
she looked up at the tall trees.

12
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.583
She saw a flock of gibbons flying by.

13
00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:50.791
As she walked a few more steps.

14
00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:53.916
she saw a beautiful.
but unusual-looking forest butterfly

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.166
that she had never seen before.

16
00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:04.000
The farther she walked away from the camp.

17
00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:07.666
the more she appreciated
the beauty of this forest.

18
00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:52.708
...Sukhumvit Station.
Doors will open on the right.

19
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:57.958
You will be able to transfer
to other stations at this stop.

20
00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:43.708
Good morning. Mr. Joe.

21
00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:50.833
All documents and customer letters
have been translated into English.

22
00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:52.125
Right there. sir.

23
00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.500
Okay.

24
00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:59.375
And did you call Mr. Sompong yet?

25
00:03:59.458 --> 00:04:03.166

at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

26
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.333

00:04:05.416 --> 00:04:07.916

Understood.

42
00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:52.958
Wait.

43
00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:59.375
Next Sunday. you'll come

Book the tickets and hotel accommodations.

45

50
00:06:02.583 --> 00:06:04.125
What do you think?

51
00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:06.791
We can sign the contract next week.

52
00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:09.250
Try the steamed fish.

53
00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.333
I prefer duck.

54
00:06:17.416 --> 00:06:18.416
I LOVE SHANGHAI

55
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.375
Sorry. sorry.

56
00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.500
Hello. Mr. Ma.

57
00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:23.666
Hello.

58
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.166
Are you Ricky?

59
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.291
Yes.

60
00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:32.750
I have a very precious
and rare antique item.

61
00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:35.333
You might be interested.

62
00:08:51.458 --> 00:08:52.708
Qing dynasty vase.

63
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:55.416
It's ancient. at least 250 years old.

64
00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.000
Where did you get it?

65
00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:02.333
A desert island near Chengxi.

66
00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:06.958
I went out on a limb to get it.

67
00:09:07.416 --> 00:09:08.541
How much?

68
00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:09.625
One million yuan.

69
00:09:17.833 --> 00:09:21.458
Went out on a limb?

70
00:09:22.333 --> 00:09:24.166
Why are you laughing?

71
00:09:25.916 --> 00:09:26.750
I'm not going to buy it.

72
00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:28.791
Why not?

73
00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:30.208
Is it too expensive?

74
00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:31.875
The price is negotiable.

75
00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.708
If you think it's too expensive.

76
00:09:33.791 --> 00:09:35.666
then... 900.000.

77
00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:36.750
No.

78
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:39.791
-800.000.
-No.

79
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.833
Here. final deal.

80
00:09:41.916 --> 00:09:43.250
-700.000.
-No.

81
00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:44.458
-500.000.
-No.

82
00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:45.541
Are you messing with me?

83
00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:46.458
No.

84
00:09:47.583 --> 00:09:48.958
-Come again?
-Are you?

85
00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.500
It's not about the price.

86
00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:53.541
But this vase...

87
00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:54.583
It's fake.

88
00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.125
Now you're offending me.

89
00:09:57.208 --> 00:09:59.875
-Do you think I'm trying to trick you?
-Yes.

90
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.041
The glaze is too smooth.

91
00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:06.500
The Qing Dynasty vases

92
00:10:06.583 --> 00:10:07.875
have uniqueness

93
00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.791
with emboldened patterns.

94
00:10:10.875 --> 00:10:12.541
This is definitely...

95
00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:13.583
Thai craftmanship.

96
00:10:13.666 --> 00:10:15.500
It's survived years of wind and sun.

97
00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:17.125
It's old. isn't it?

98
00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:19.250
It's too narrow at the bottom.

99
00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:20.958
and the top is too wide.

100
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.916
You're overanalyzing.

101
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.291
-And its color...
-...was a new and innovative design.

102
00:10:31.125 --> 00:10:33.583
Take your things and leave.

103
00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:43.416
Empress Dowager Cixi's hairpin...

104
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.625
definitely authentic.

105
00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:46.375
No less than 2 million yuan.

106
00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:47.541
You can have it

107
00:10:47.625 --> 00:10:48.500
for 1 million yuan.

108
00:10:48.708 --> 00:10:49.916
This is also fake.

109
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.083
Mirror quality.

110
00:10:51.166 --> 00:10:52.875
How can you say it's fake?

111
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.875
Leave right now.

112
00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.458
If you don't. I'll throw you out.

113
00:10:55.541 --> 00:10:56.458
Well. you can try.

114
00:10:58.041 --> 00:10:59.166
How long have you been there?

115
00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:06.000
Want a fight? Train for 10 more years!

116
00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:09.416
Hey!

117
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.333
Hey!

118
00:11:13.875 --> 00:11:15.000
You think I'm scared?

119
00:11:54.416 --> 00:11:57.166
This vase is at least 250 years old.

120
00:11:59.791 --> 00:12:02.625
I really need the money right now.

121
00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:06.125
I'll sell it at a low price. uncle.

122
00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:07.166
How much?

123
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.166
-One million yuan.
-Hell no!

124
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.916
This is obviously fake.

125
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.625
-You can tell just by looking?
-I can tell from your face.

126
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.291
You always come here with fakes.

127
00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:19.041
We've known each other for so long.

128
00:12:20.833 --> 00:12:23.083
Really?

129
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.333
All right. I'll buy it.

130
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.500
I'll use it as a flower vase.

131
00:12:34.458 --> 00:12:35.708
20.000 yuan.

132
00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:42.208
-500!
-What?

133
00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:43.708
What a rip-off. uncle!

134
00:12:43.791 --> 00:12:45.208
I won't buy it then.

135
00:12:46.416 --> 00:12:47.625
All right. give it to me.

136
00:12:50.208 --> 00:12:52.791
Damn stingy old man.
wait until I get my turn.

137
00:13:57.291 --> 00:13:59.625
Why the English? I don't care.

138
00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:04.916
Uncle.

139
00:14:06.666 --> 00:14:08.666
Hey. you. let's talk.

140
00:14:09.708 --> 00:14:10.625
Are you Thai?

141
00:14:11.208 --> 00:14:12.041
Yes. I am.

142
00:14:12.125 --> 00:14:13.333
Sorry. I didn't know.

143
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.583
Uncle.

144
00:14:15.666 --> 00:14:19.083
-Hey. I saw these figurines first.
-And?

145
00:14:19.166 --> 00:14:21.541
I was gonna buy them.
but you just took one.

146
00:14:21.625 --> 00:14:22.916
I'm going to buy it too.

147
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.625
I was gonna buy it first.

148
00:14:24.708 --> 00:14:27.083
What? It was there. so I took it.

149
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.166
Here. I took this one first.
They are a pair. you see?

150
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.541
Oh. it's a pair?

151
00:14:32.625 --> 00:14:34.083
-Perfect. I'll...
-No.

152
00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:39.833
I'm going to buy them both as a pair.
I saw them first.

153
00:14:39.916 --> 00:14:41.291
Okay. I'll take just one.

154
00:14:41.916 --> 00:14:44.708
It's not okay. I want them both.

155
00:14:46.083 --> 00:14:47.125
Nonsense.

156
00:14:47.208 --> 00:14:48.333
Uncle. how much?

157
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:51.125
How much is it?

158
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.458
No. they're sold as a pair.

159
00:14:55.416 --> 00:14:56.833
-How much for both?
-2.000 yuan.

160
00:14:56.916 --> 00:14:58.291
That's expensive.

161
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.083
-100 yuan.
-No!

162
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.833
These are handmade.
and not available on the market anymore.

163
00:15:04.916 --> 00:15:09.375
They have been passed down
for a hundred years.

164
00:15:11.166 --> 00:15:12.541
Don't exaggerate.

165
00:15:14.416 --> 00:15:15.875
Look at the colors.

166
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.958
Observe the craftsmanship.

167
00:15:18.625 --> 00:15:21.500
Doesn't it look like century-old work?

168
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.875
Are you sure?

169
00:15:26.291 --> 00:15:28.750
Qing dynasty seal. Emperor Guangxu's.

170
00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:30.458
And this?

171
00:15:30.916 --> 00:15:33.166
-Made for Zhang Bao Lin.
-Who's that?

172
00:15:34.541 --> 00:15:36.041
Listen.

173
00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:41.166
More than a century ago...

174
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.250
in a small village in Hunan province.

175
00:15:45.333 --> 00:15:47.833
there was a notorious thief named

176
00:15:47.916 --> 00:15:49.666
Zhang Bao Lin.

177
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.208
According to legend.

178
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:52.625
he had a big black beard.

179
00:15:52.708 --> 00:15:55.833
He led a ruthless gang
of black-bearded bandits.

180
00:15:55.916 --> 00:15:59.333
Law enforcement tried to catch him
but never succeeded.

181
00:15:59.791 --> 00:16:02.833
People were terrified.

182
00:16:02.916 --> 00:16:04.541
These two items

183
00:16:06.125 --> 00:16:09.833
were inherited from
Zhang Bao Lin's family.

184
00:16:13.125 --> 00:16:15.041
Quite a brag.

185
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.625
Handed down from generation to generation.

186
00:16:19.916 --> 00:16:21.375
-200 yuan.
-Deal.

187
00:16:21.458 --> 00:16:23.916
Two for 400 yuan.

188
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.166
You sell it that easy?

189
00:16:26.583 --> 00:16:27.416
I only want half.

190
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.958
Cut it in half? It's not a swordfish.

191
00:16:30.041 --> 00:16:31.208
It's sold as a pair.

192
00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:33.458
400 yuan.

193
00:16:35.541 --> 00:16:39.041
For 200 yuan each. a total of 400.

194
00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:42.791
I didn't say I'd buy them yet.

195
00:16:42.875 --> 00:16:46.583
Didn't you see me negotiating the price?

196
00:16:47.458 --> 00:16:49.791
What now?
If you don't want it. give it to me.

197
00:16:58.041 --> 00:16:58.875
Here.

198
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:08.416
Can you lend me a hundred?

199
00:17:09.083 --> 00:17:10.333
What?

200
00:17:10.416 --> 00:17:13.708
I'll pay you back.
We're both Thai. Why are you so mean?

201
00:17:14.208 --> 00:17:15.208
Come on.

202
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:18.458
The price was a thousand. I negotiated.

203
00:17:19.166 --> 00:17:20.000
Come on.

204
00:17:21.333 --> 00:17:23.875
Just a hundred. don't be mean.
I'll pay you back.

205
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.916
Here you go.

206
00:18:21.083 --> 00:18:22.041
Can I sit here?

207
00:18:23.375 --> 00:18:24.250
Hey. you.

208
00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:26.708
What a coincidence!

209
00:18:26.791 --> 00:18:27.958
All the tables are taken.

210
00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:35.583
Hey. what are you eating?

211
00:18:36.416 --> 00:18:38.291
With all of these options.
you ordered tofu?

212
00:18:38.375 --> 00:18:41.250
And what's this? Ear's wax? Useless.

213
00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:45.083
Waitress. special combo A!

214
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.125
Wait and see my order.

215
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:50.416
What did you order?

216
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.916
Be patient. Why are you so curious?

217
00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:55.750
Are you on vacation?

218
00:18:56.208 --> 00:18:57.166
I'm here for work.

219
00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.166
What kind of work?

220
00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:01.875
Secretary.

221
00:19:04.666 --> 00:19:06.916
Shouldn't you be in the office?
Why are you here?

222
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.541
I'm here with my boss.

223
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.166
You ask too many questions.
Why are you so curious?

224
00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:19.333
So. you live here?

225
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.250
For a few years.

226
00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.500
I've been to many places.

227
00:19:24.291 --> 00:19:25.375
I go wherever I want.

228
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.875
So. where were you before this?

229
00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:31.291
Many places. Why all the questions?

230
00:19:50.666 --> 00:19:51.750
-Try this.
-No.

231
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.750
Try it and tell me if it's good.
Go ahead. it's good stuff.

232
00:19:55.833 --> 00:19:57.125
Better than this earwax.

233
00:19:58.583 --> 00:19:59.416
All right?

234
00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:08.375
How is it?

235
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.166
Yeah. it's good.

236
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.791
See. I told you it's good.

237
00:20:22.541 --> 00:20:25.750
If you want some. order it yourself.

238
00:20:25.833 --> 00:20:27.333
How long are you here for?

239
00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:29.416
Four days.

240
00:20:31.083 --> 00:20:32.208
Where are you staying?

241
00:20:33.291 --> 00:20:34.416
A hotel around here.

242
00:20:35.541 --> 00:20:36.625
Shanghai Grand?

243
00:20:38.916 --> 00:20:39.958
How would he know?

244
00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:43.875
Whoa. you're rich! It's expensive there.

245
00:20:44.416 --> 00:20:45.625
I'm here with my boss.

246
00:20:47.541 --> 00:20:48.416
Are you his mistress?

247
00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:51.583
No! Are you crazy?

248
00:20:51.666 --> 00:20:54.750
Oh. who knows? In the movies.
they often show secret romances.

249
00:20:56.791 --> 00:20:57.666
What's your name?

250
00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:01.875
-Joy.
-I'm Ricky.

251
00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.708
-Just call me Rick.
-Like Ricky Martin?

252
00:21:06.166 --> 00:21:07.083
Funny. huh?

253
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:10.583
Heng.

254
00:21:11.416 --> 00:21:12.250
Ricky Heng.

255
00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:17.250
That's funnier.

256
00:21:29.125 --> 00:21:31.666
Is Chow here?

257
00:21:54.708 --> 00:21:56.500
You have the money?

258
00:22:00.875 --> 00:22:02.833
Good. I don't have to go after you.

259
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.041
This morning. Mr. Ting was asking
when you'd pay the debt.

260
00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:10.833
It's one day past due.

261
00:22:15.833 --> 00:22:19.375
Well. there were some technical issues.

262
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.458
I'm here to ask
if I can pay in installments.

263
00:22:25.458 --> 00:22:26.916
I'll definitely pay my debt.

264
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.833
You're quite cunning.

265
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:31.583
All right.

266
00:22:32.416 --> 00:22:34.166
I'll just sell your car.

267
00:22:34.625 --> 00:22:36.708
Take it easy.
I only owe a couple of thousand.

268
00:22:36.791 --> 00:22:38.291
My car is worth a lot more.

269
00:22:38.375 --> 00:22:40.541
I didn't know
what I sold to Mr. Ting was fake.

270
00:22:40.625 --> 00:22:41.833
You can't blame me.

271
00:22:42.541 --> 00:22:44.875
Why don't you sell your car
and pay off your debt?

272
00:22:45.541 --> 00:22:48.416
I already told you.
I'm not selling this one.

273
00:22:49.958 --> 00:22:52.166
Should I cut off a finger?

274
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.291
Why cut your own finger?

275
00:22:53.791 --> 00:22:55.500
Your finger. asshole!

276
00:22:55.583 --> 00:22:57.666
Why the hell would I cut off
my own finger?

277
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.916
I'll give you six days.

278
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.708
Fine. seven.

279
00:23:05.791 --> 00:23:07.541
-Well. eight.
-Is nine okay?

280
00:23:08.666 --> 00:23:11.708
All right. two weeks and I'll pay in full.

281
00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:13.000
Fine.

282
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.250
Two weeks.

283
00:23:16.083 --> 00:23:18.541
If you can't pay it back by then.

284
00:23:20.125 --> 00:23:22.791
I'll disassemble your car
and sell the parts.

285
00:23:22.875 --> 00:23:26.708
I'll cut your fingers and toes
and turn you into Doraemon.

286
00:23:28.333 --> 00:23:30.041
So ruthless. you shitface.

287
00:23:30.583 --> 00:23:32.708
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

288
00:23:34.375 --> 00:23:35.208
Fine then.

289
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.208
Two weeks?

290
00:23:45.916 --> 00:23:49.291
Back to work! What are you doing?

291
00:23:49.375 --> 00:23:50.458
Don't have work to do?

292
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:52.000
I'll have you clean toilets.

293
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.166
HAPPINESS HUT

294
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:41.000
From the president.

295
00:24:41.083 --> 00:24:43.250
No. I don't drink.

296
00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:44.750
It's from the president...

297
00:24:44.833 --> 00:24:46.875
-I never drink...
-Just once a year.

298
00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:48.625
-I don't drink.
-Once a year.

299
00:24:48.708 --> 00:24:49.833
-Not often.
-But...

300
00:24:49.916 --> 00:24:50.750
But I...

301
00:24:55.375 --> 00:24:57.875
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

302
00:25:06.875 --> 00:25:08.250
All of the liquor is gone.

303
00:25:14.166 --> 00:25:15.875
Let me open it. Mr. Joe.

304
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:25.333
Easy...

305
00:25:28.375 --> 00:25:30.000
Holy shit!

306
00:25:30.083 --> 00:25:34.000
-Is the president dead?
-Are you okay?

307
00:25:34.083 --> 00:25:38.875
Oh. no. right in the middle.
hitting the Yintang acupoint.

308
00:25:49.208 --> 00:25:52.083
-Fifteen. you lost.
-Twenty.

309
00:26:34.833 --> 00:26:35.708
Hey!

310
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.291
God damn it!

311
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.875
You embarrassed me tonight.

312
00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:48.333
I'm sorry.

313
00:27:50.541 --> 00:27:54.333
How long have you worked for me?

314
00:27:54.416 --> 00:27:56.208
About 10 months.

315
00:27:56.791 --> 00:27:58.291
In these 10 months.

316
00:27:58.375 --> 00:28:01.000
you've been making small mistakes
the whole time.

317
00:28:03.583 --> 00:28:05.583
But do you know why you're still employed?

318
00:28:06.583 --> 00:28:07.708
Because I like you.

319
00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:15.375
You are really beautiful. Joy.

320
00:28:17.208 --> 00:28:18.541
I can take care of you.

321
00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:20.666
No matter what you want

322
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.291
or how much you need each month.

323
00:28:25.041 --> 00:28:27.500
Seems like size 39.

324
00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:28.583
You want 39.000?

325
00:28:30.791 --> 00:28:31.791
Why did you kick me?

326
00:28:34.666 --> 00:28:35.875
What are you doing?

327
00:28:35.958 --> 00:28:37.625
I'm trying to talk to you.

328
00:28:37.708 --> 00:28:39.000
I won't talk to you like this.

329
00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:40.833
-Then get out.
-Sure!

330
00:28:42.416 --> 00:28:43.500
Then I fucking quit!

331
00:28:43.583 --> 00:28:45.041
Fine. get out... Yes. ma'am.

332
00:28:59.458 --> 00:29:00.875
-Hello.
-Hello.

333
00:29:00.958 --> 00:29:04.750
I'm looking for my Thai friend
who's staying here.

334
00:29:04.833 --> 00:29:06.000
-A Thai?
-Yes.

335
00:29:06.083 --> 00:29:07.500
Do you have an appointment?

336
00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:09.500
No. I don't.

337
00:29:10.166 --> 00:29:11.583
She'll want to see me.

338
00:29:12.041 --> 00:29:16.166
Sorry. I can't provide you
with our client's information.

339
00:29:16.916 --> 00:29:18.958
-Yes. you can.
-No. I can't.

340
00:29:24.833 --> 00:29:25.916
I cannot. really.

341
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.875
You can.

342
00:29:26.958 --> 00:29:27.833
I really can't.

343
00:29:27.916 --> 00:29:28.791
You can.

344
00:29:29.125 --> 00:29:30.416
I really can't.

345
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.583
There she is.

346
00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:38.791
She's here.

347
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:42.625
Hey.

348
00:29:43.541 --> 00:29:44.458
Are you leaving now?

349
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:49.250
Yeah. I guess.

350
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.541
Can I talk to you?

351
00:29:53.541 --> 00:29:55.666
Two hot teas. please.

352
00:29:57.583 --> 00:29:58.541
Listen.

353
00:29:59.708 --> 00:30:01.416
Do you still have that figurine?

354
00:30:03.791 --> 00:30:04.666
Yes.

355
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.875
Will you sell it to me? I'll give you 400.

356
00:30:08.583 --> 00:30:10.125
Fine. 500 then.

357
00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:12.208
You only paid 200. so it's a 300 profit.

358
00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:14.750
But I'll pay you over time.

359
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.625
No. I won't sell it.

360
00:30:17.708 --> 00:30:18.875
Why?

361
00:30:20.208 --> 00:30:21.958
Please. I need it.

362
00:30:22.416 --> 00:30:23.333
Why?

363
00:30:23.416 --> 00:30:24.708
I just need it.

364
00:30:25.416 --> 00:30:26.541
But I don't want to sell it.

365
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.333
I'm sorry.

366
00:30:28.416 --> 00:30:30.458
-I have to go to the airport.
-Wait. wait.

367
00:30:30.541 --> 00:30:32.333
-Sit down. please.
-What?

368
00:30:37.291 --> 00:30:38.375
All right.

369
00:30:43.166 --> 00:30:44.125
What's that?

370
00:30:44.208 --> 00:30:45.583
Before I came to you.

371
00:30:45.666 --> 00:30:48.125
I broke my figurine
and I found this inside.

372
00:30:48.208 --> 00:30:49.833
-A map?
-A treasure map.

373
00:30:49.916 --> 00:30:51.833
-What treasure map?
-I don't know.

374
00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:52.833
What?

375
00:30:53.833 --> 00:30:55.833
But my hunter's instincts tell me

376
00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:58.041
it must be a valuable treasure.

377
00:30:59.125 --> 00:31:00.458
What instincts?

378
00:31:01.208 --> 00:31:02.041
Hunter.

379
00:31:04.083 --> 00:31:05.083
Why are you laughing?

380
00:31:06.291 --> 00:31:07.625
No. nothing.

381
00:31:08.208 --> 00:31:10.083
Look. this is only part of the map.

382
00:31:10.166 --> 00:31:12.375
There must be another part to complete it.

383
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.750
And you think it's in my figurine?

384
00:31:16.833 --> 00:31:17.708
Yes.

385
00:31:37.208 --> 00:31:38.041
Really?

386
00:31:38.125 --> 00:31:39.541
Looks like it.

387
00:31:40.041 --> 00:31:40.916
Let's break it.

388
00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:43.833
-And what if nothing is inside?
-Then nothing.

389
00:31:43.916 --> 00:31:45.791
Just like that?

390
00:31:45.875 --> 00:31:46.916
You never know.

391
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.458
Nah.

392
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:51.250
Why not?

393
00:31:55.833 --> 00:31:56.666
Listen...

394
00:31:57.666 --> 00:32:00.208
if you break it and the map is there.

395
00:32:01.791 --> 00:32:03.750
we'll go hunt for the treasure together

396
00:32:04.916 --> 00:32:07.250
and split it 70/30.

397
00:32:07.791 --> 00:32:09.375
-Who gets 70?
-Me.

398
00:32:09.875 --> 00:32:11.041
That's cheating.

399
00:32:11.666 --> 00:32:12.916
Fine. 50/50 then.

400
00:32:16.166 --> 00:32:18.958
Do you really believe
that there are real treasures?

401
00:32:19.875 --> 00:32:21.916
Someone might have just made it up.

402
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.333
Who would make up something like this?

403
00:32:25.416 --> 00:32:27.416
Remember that seller?

404
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.791
He got it from Black Beard's village.

405
00:32:29.875 --> 00:32:32.916
I did my research
about the Black Beard bandit.

406
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.500
He stole treasures
and hid them over 100 years ago.

407
00:32:35.583 --> 00:32:38.875
I believe that this map
will lead us to those treasures.

408
00:32:41.166 --> 00:32:42.875
And I have no choice.

409
00:32:43.333 --> 00:32:44.958
I only have two weeks.

410
00:32:45.041 --> 00:32:46.041
I need money.

411
00:32:49.875 --> 00:32:52.083
Actually. I need money too.

412
00:32:52.791 --> 00:32:54.625
I just got fired.

413
00:32:55.541 --> 00:32:56.500
Why?

414
00:32:56.583 --> 00:32:58.416
I kicked my boss in the face.

415
00:33:02.166 --> 00:33:03.125
Are you serious?

416
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:10.458
You're not lying to me?

417
00:33:10.541 --> 00:33:12.166
No.

418
00:33:18.875 --> 00:33:19.833
Let's try then.

419
00:33:28.875 --> 00:33:31.750
My cup broke again?
Why can't you eat quietly?

420
00:33:31.833 --> 00:33:33.875
Sorry. Sorry.

421
00:33:34.958 --> 00:33:36.500
Why would you hit it on the table?

422
00:33:49.708 --> 00:33:50.833
There. you see?

423
00:33:52.208 --> 00:33:53.083
That's right.

424
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.500
Damn! What's the big secret?

425
00:34:05.583 --> 00:34:08.208
Just an old painting. What's all the fuss?

426
00:34:08.291 --> 00:34:10.000
As if it's something valuable.

427
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:11.583
Lift your legs.

428
00:34:13.208 --> 00:34:15.791
What's the big deal?
As if it's a treasure!

429
00:34:15.875 --> 00:34:17.291
Who would want that?

430
00:34:19.625 --> 00:34:21.208
I guess you'll have to stay.

431
00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:22.791
I'll find you a budget hotel.

432
00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:26.583
Come on. sis.

433
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.250
Just two nights. please help out.

434
00:34:30.333 --> 00:34:32.000
Give her a special price.

435
00:34:33.208 --> 00:34:35.500
You still owe me from before.

436
00:34:36.125 --> 00:34:37.875
I'll pay this month.

437
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.333
Pay early next time.

438
00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:46.583
Thank you. big sister.

439
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.083
That's how she is. Come on.

440
00:34:55.666 --> 00:34:57.000
How is it?

441
00:34:57.083 --> 00:34:58.458
Do I have a choice?

442
00:34:58.833 --> 00:35:01.291
Good. don't be picky.
You don't have money.

443
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.708
Here. give me your map.

444
00:35:09.375 --> 00:35:11.583
Where do you think the remaining part is?

445
00:35:11.666 --> 00:35:14.083
If these were in the figurines.

446
00:35:14.166 --> 00:35:16.750
the rest should be
in another figurine too.

447
00:35:16.833 --> 00:35:18.166
That's right.

448
00:35:18.791 --> 00:35:20.166
Why didn't I think of that?

449
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.375
It's not that hard.

450
00:35:23.041 --> 00:35:24.916
What figurine though?

451
00:35:25.666 --> 00:35:27.375
And is it even real?

452
00:35:28.625 --> 00:35:33.875
Or someone else might have found it
and already discovered the treasure?

453
00:35:34.583 --> 00:35:37.583
The X-mark should be in the missing part.

454
00:35:37.666 --> 00:35:40.083
Since what we have
doesn't show the hiding spot.

455
00:35:40.166 --> 00:35:41.291
No. it's not.

456
00:35:41.375 --> 00:35:43.791
This map is not like
a regular treasure map.

457
00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:46.583
This kind of map must start here.

458
00:35:47.541 --> 00:35:52.333
Follow this line to another spot
and you'll get here.

459
00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:54.791
You can't find the treasure
if you're missing any part of the map.

460
00:35:54.875 --> 00:35:55.791
What do we do?

461
00:35:55.875 --> 00:35:57.666
We have to find the missing part
of the map.

462
00:35:59.125 --> 00:36:00.625
Let's try.

463
00:36:01.583 --> 00:36:05.375
You can leave if you're chickening out
but then I get to keep the map.

464
00:36:06.208 --> 00:36:09.083
What if the other figurine
was bought by a German.

465
00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:11.708
and it's now in Germany or Africa

466
00:36:12.583 --> 00:36:14.708
or Syria. or somewhere else?

467
00:36:15.208 --> 00:36:17.250
Fine. let's give up.

468
00:36:17.333 --> 00:36:19.083
What? You're just gonna quit?

469
00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:20.208
What do you want then?

470
00:36:21.125 --> 00:36:23.791
What I said was possible.

471
00:36:23.875 --> 00:36:24.916
I don't know that.

472
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.541
Let me sleep on it.

473
00:36:29.875 --> 00:36:31.250
-What?
-What are you doing?

474
00:36:31.666 --> 00:36:32.583
Taking a photo of it.

475
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.583
No. what if you leave me?

476
00:36:37.041 --> 00:36:39.375
What are you talking about?
I'm doing my own research.

477
00:36:39.458 --> 00:36:42.916
Trust me.
Even though I seem untrustworthy.

478
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.541
I always keep my promises.

479
00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:48.375
Let's talk tomorrow.

480
00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:51.583
I'm right next door. Call me if anything.

481
00:36:53.708 --> 00:36:56.541
And don't ditch me. We're partners now.

482
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.625
I know where Zheng Kun in the map is.

483
00:37:15.125 --> 00:37:16.875
-Where?
-Fenghuang.

484
00:37:16.958 --> 00:37:20.208
Zheng Kun is the old name of Fenghuang
a hundred years ago.

485
00:37:20.291 --> 00:37:21.875
I did research last night.

486
00:37:21.958 --> 00:37:23.416
Fenghuang is located in Hunan.

487
00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:26.000
near Zhang Bao Lin's hometown.

488
00:37:26.083 --> 00:37:29.000
The Black Beard gang
used to hide in the nearby jungle.

489
00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:32.958
Wow. that's a lot of details.

490
00:37:33.041 --> 00:37:34.291
Yup. I burnt the midnight oil.

491
00:37:35.125 --> 00:37:39.166
Here. the word "dragon's heart"
might refer to hidden treasure.

492
00:37:41.875 --> 00:37:43.125
That's all I know.

493
00:37:44.083 --> 00:37:45.666
I don't know what's next.

494
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.833
-What?
-We'll figure it out.

495
00:37:47.916 --> 00:37:48.916
Let's head to Fenghuang first.

496
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:49.958
Are you sure?

497
00:37:50.041 --> 00:37:51.041
Of course.

498
00:37:52.708 --> 00:37:54.916
Did you get any sleep though?

499
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.583
No. this is nothing.

500
00:37:56.666 --> 00:37:59.541
I can stay up for three or four days.

501
00:38:07.208 --> 00:38:08.291
Yes. sir.

502
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:30.750
I'm full.

503
00:38:30.833 --> 00:38:35.666
I'm full.

504
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:41.250
I have no money.

505
00:38:41.583 --> 00:38:47.625
I have no money.

506
00:38:47.708 --> 00:38:53.125
I'm lost.

507
00:38:53.208 --> 00:38:56.041
-I'm last.
-Not that.

508
00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:57.958
I'm lost.

509
00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.583
Bro. let's take a break.

510
00:39:02.416 --> 00:39:04.541
I have a headache. This is too difficult.

511
00:39:06.125 --> 00:39:08.541
Stop complaining already.

512
00:39:08.625 --> 00:39:11.250
If you don't practice now. then when?

513
00:39:11.333 --> 00:39:13.083
You'll fail the test.

514
00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.625
Why did he send us here to study Chinese?

515
00:39:17.458 --> 00:39:21.958
On the bright side.
it's a free trip to study here.

516
00:39:22.041 --> 00:39:23.958
And you get to see beautiful places.

517
00:39:24.541 --> 00:39:29.125
It's fun for a while
but it gets boring being here for months.

518
00:39:29.208 --> 00:39:31.583
Look at it this way.

519
00:39:31.666 --> 00:39:34.166
it's like going back to school
like we were kids.

520
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.375
I spent my time playing snooker all day.

521
00:39:36.458 --> 00:39:39.125
That's why you're stupid.

522
00:39:39.208 --> 00:39:42.791
Because you didn't study.
you ended up being a bouncer.

523
00:39:42.875 --> 00:39:44.208
That's all you can do.

524
00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:45.666
There's no future in that.

525
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.208
As if you were a good student.

526
00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:49.458
You can't say that.

527
00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:52.541
I was good. I have a vocational education.

528
00:39:52.625 --> 00:39:54.291
You know nothing.

529
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:58.166
But you just got out of jail.
You are worse.

530
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:59.958
That's another story.

531
00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:02.500
The boss must have a plan for us.

532
00:40:02.583 --> 00:40:04.916
You'll get to deal with foreigners.

533
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.500
Have you ever seen it on TV?

534
00:40:06.583 --> 00:40:10.750
The government
even sends officials to work abroad.

535
00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:14.916
Our boss has watched
too many gangster movies.

536
00:40:15.833 --> 00:40:16.791
What do you want?

537
00:40:17.375 --> 00:40:19.875
Do you want to be a shitty thug
like before?

538
00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:28.000
Listen. if we go back as thugs.

539
00:40:28.583 --> 00:40:31.125
we'll be thugs who can speak Chinese.

540
00:40:31.208 --> 00:40:33.625
Isn't that cool?

541
00:40:34.041 --> 00:40:34.875
Cool?

542
00:40:34.958 --> 00:40:35.875
Yeah.

543
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.375
Let's find something to do.

544
00:40:41.458 --> 00:40:42.541
Check. please?

545
00:40:43.708 --> 00:40:45.666
Hurry up.

546
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:47.041
Hurry up.

547
00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:48.416
You're good.

548
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.833
-Hurry up.
-Quick learner.

549
00:40:49.916 --> 00:40:51.375
Hurry up.

550
00:40:52.125 --> 00:40:53.291
Not bad.

551
00:40:54.083 --> 00:40:55.125
Hey.

552
00:40:58.666 --> 00:41:01.416
Who threw the cigarette butt down there?

553
00:41:02.166 --> 00:41:04.083
What did he say? I don't get it.

554
00:41:05.458 --> 00:41:08.958
Can you speak English? Try again.

555
00:41:10.375 --> 00:41:11.791
I'm asking you

556
00:41:11.875 --> 00:41:13.416
who threw the cigarette butt?

557
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.708
It landed on my head.

558
00:41:15.125 --> 00:41:18.750
What does that mean "toa"? Look it up.

559
00:41:20.041 --> 00:41:22.666
Okay. now speak.

560
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.250
-Again.
-"Toa..."?

561
00:41:24.333 --> 00:41:26.416
I'm asking you. Can't you understand?

562
00:41:27.083 --> 00:41:27.916
What did he say?

563
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.458
Yes.

564
00:41:29.541 --> 00:41:31.250
Let's just say "yes."

565
00:41:32.708 --> 00:41:35.041
They are messing with me.

566
00:41:35.708 --> 00:41:37.250
Yes. That's a "yes."

567
00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.916
-What do you want? Say it.
-Hey.

568
00:41:41.583 --> 00:41:43.875
-Mee Sua...
-"Ni" not "Mee".

569
00:41:44.583 --> 00:41:46.958
You say. I don't understand.

570
00:42:05.458 --> 00:42:06.833
Did I drop it on his head. bro?

571
00:42:06.916 --> 00:42:07.750
Yes.

572
00:42:09.625 --> 00:42:10.458
Calm down.

573
00:42:10.875 --> 00:42:12.208
I'm sorry.

574
00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:13.333
I didn't mean to.

575
00:42:13.416 --> 00:42:14.250
I'm sorry.

576
00:42:14.333 --> 00:42:16.000
What are you laughing at?

577
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.500
Do you know who I am?

578
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:23.125
He said "I'm sorry."
He apologized to you. Get it?

579
00:42:23.208 --> 00:42:24.041
Go. Go.

580
00:42:24.125 --> 00:42:26.583
Go away. I don't want to fight.

581
00:42:26.666 --> 00:42:28.833
Just say sorry. and think that's it?

582
00:42:30.041 --> 00:42:31.916
You won't let go. huh? Wait.

583
00:42:35.291 --> 00:42:38.833
I hope you get well soon.

584
00:42:38.916 --> 00:42:40.666
I learned those words. Happy now?

585
00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:46.291
Hey! My jacket!

586
00:42:53.083 --> 00:42:56.416
You're always looking for trouble.

587
00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.916
I went to jail in Thailand.
You want me to go to jail here?

588
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.833
Well?

589
00:43:00.916 --> 00:43:02.708
-Let's go.
-Before the police come.

590
00:43:02.791 --> 00:43:03.791
Pay him.

591
00:43:04.541 --> 00:43:05.458
How much?

592
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.500
Now he can speak English.

593
00:43:08.583 --> 00:43:10.750
I don't like free stuff. Let's go.

594
00:43:11.958 --> 00:43:13.250
You think you're a badass?

595
00:43:13.333 --> 00:43:15.166
-Wait up.
-What now?

596
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.625
I forgot my cell phone.

597
00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:18.750
I slipped because of you.

598
00:43:21.458 --> 00:43:24.875
Damn it.
I have enough troubles in Thailand.

599
00:43:24.958 --> 00:43:26.833
now I have more in China.

600
00:43:26.916 --> 00:43:28.791
Are we there yet?

601
00:43:29.458 --> 00:43:31.916
This hotel is so far. So many steps too.

602
00:43:32.875 --> 00:43:34.208
I'm starving.

603
00:43:34.291 --> 00:43:37.416
-We're here.
-Finally.

604
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.000
Stop complaining.

605
00:43:44.416 --> 00:43:45.583
Where are we going?

606
00:43:45.666 --> 00:43:49.166
To see my friend.
I think we need one more on our team.

607
00:43:49.791 --> 00:43:51.541
Someone who knows the terrain

608
00:43:51.625 --> 00:43:54.750
and can read the symbols.
maps and Chinese characters.

609
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.541
Who is your friend?

610
00:43:56.625 --> 00:43:57.791
Jackie...

611
00:43:57.875 --> 00:43:59.041
Chan?

612
00:43:59.125 --> 00:44:02.000
Why would I bring in Jackie Chan?
It's my friend Jackie.

613
00:44:02.375 --> 00:44:03.708
How would I know?

614
00:44:03.791 --> 00:44:05.291
We'd be lost with Jackie Chan.

615
00:44:14.875 --> 00:44:17.041
Jackie has been in China
for over 10 years.

616
00:44:17.125 --> 00:44:21.166
His language. communication.
and terrain skills should help us.

617
00:44:23.125 --> 00:44:25.000
I don't mean to brag.

618
00:44:25.083 --> 00:44:26.333
but when it comes to language.

619
00:44:26.416 --> 00:44:29.833
I'm an expert of both modern
and ancient Chinese.

620
00:44:30.416 --> 00:44:32.500
I can also speak nine other languages.

621
00:44:32.583 --> 00:44:33.708
What are they?

622
00:44:33.791 --> 00:44:36.250
Thai. Chinese. English. French. Spanish.

623
00:44:36.333 --> 00:44:39.958
Italian. Japanese. Arabic. and African.
all dialects. you name it.

624
00:44:40.041 --> 00:44:44.000
Wow. Can you show me some?

625
00:44:44.083 --> 00:44:45.208
Which one?

626
00:44:46.125 --> 00:44:46.958
How about French?

627
00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:48.166
French...

628
00:44:51.833 --> 00:44:52.750
How about Spanish?

629
00:44:53.708 --> 00:44:54.541
More?

630
00:45:00.166 --> 00:45:01.000
Italian.

631
00:45:07.625 --> 00:45:08.583
Japanese.

632
00:45:12.291 --> 00:45:13.458
African.

633
00:45:19.166 --> 00:45:20.458
-Arabic.
-That's enough.

634
00:45:20.541 --> 00:45:23.000
Apart from being a language expert.

635
00:45:23.083 --> 00:45:25.250
I also have another special skill.

636
00:45:25.333 --> 00:45:26.166
What is it?

637
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.041
I can talk to animals.

638
00:45:31.916 --> 00:45:32.750
Really?

639
00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.791
If you don't believe me. I'll show you.

640
00:45:48.458 --> 00:45:51.666
He said he is fine and sleepy.

641
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:52.958
He didn't say a thing.

642
00:45:53.583 --> 00:45:55.250
It's my special skill.

643
00:45:56.291 --> 00:45:57.333
Mr. Ricky.

644
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.291
People call me Jackie the Animal.

645
00:46:04.791 --> 00:46:08.000
What happened to your eye?

646
00:46:08.083 --> 00:46:13.208
I was shot with a .22 caliber.
Wanna see it?

647
00:46:20.666 --> 00:46:22.583
He is skilled in disguise.

648
00:46:25.791 --> 00:46:26.916
This is real.

649
00:46:28.333 --> 00:46:30.916
Be it the jungle. the terrain.

650
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.833
I know them all quite well.

651
00:46:33.916 --> 00:46:36.041
I'm sure I can help both of you.

652
00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:43.541
Well...

653
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:51.291
We want to know where this is.

654
00:46:52.208 --> 00:46:53.916
-Do you know?
-Yes.

655
00:46:54.958 --> 00:46:56.500
-Just by looking?
-Yeah.

656
00:46:56.583 --> 00:46:58.791
-Where is it?
-Xiao Xan village.

657
00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:01.500
But this is not free.

658
00:47:02.333 --> 00:47:03.958
I need to get a cut.

659
00:47:09.083 --> 00:47:10.333
Can we leave tomorrow?

660
00:47:10.416 --> 00:47:13.500
Of course.
I'll pick you up in the morning.

661
00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:16.000
Jackie.

662
00:47:16.916 --> 00:47:21.375
This is a secret between us.
Don't tell anyone.

663
00:47:33.166 --> 00:47:35.250
Come on. keep going.

664
00:47:39.916 --> 00:47:41.208
I won.

665
00:47:42.166 --> 00:47:44.500
Give me the money.

666
00:47:44.583 --> 00:47:45.500
Hey.

667
00:47:46.041 --> 00:47:48.375
Can I talk to you?

668
00:47:48.458 --> 00:47:49.500
What is it?

669
00:47:53.333 --> 00:47:56.375
I want to put the treasure maps together.

670
00:47:56.458 --> 00:47:59.041
Tomorrow when we travel to the village...

671
00:48:01.541 --> 00:48:04.291
Stop talking.
what if they can understand us?

672
00:48:04.375 --> 00:48:05.916
I'm on a winning streak.

673
00:48:06.291 --> 00:48:07.791
We'll talk later. Go on.

674
00:48:10.208 --> 00:48:11.833
Hey. come. come. come.

675
00:48:42.625 --> 00:48:43.791
Cheers.

676
00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:56.000
May I sit with you?

677
00:49:01.041 --> 00:49:02.000
You're Thai?

678
00:49:02.833 --> 00:49:03.791
Yes.

679
00:49:03.875 --> 00:49:06.166
May I sit with you?

680
00:49:06.583 --> 00:49:08.458
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

681
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:12.666
What are you doing here?

682
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:13.791
I'm here for work.

683
00:49:13.875 --> 00:49:15.166
Here at Fenghuang?

684
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:17.208
No. in Shanghai.

685
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:19.375
And what are you doing here?

686
00:49:19.458 --> 00:49:22.291
I mean here in Fenghuang.

687
00:49:22.375 --> 00:49:24.250
I'm on vacation.

688
00:49:25.958 --> 00:49:28.000
How about you? What are you doing here?

689
00:49:29.625 --> 00:49:31.083
I'm a fugitive.

690
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.541
What's the crime?

691
00:49:36.625 --> 00:49:37.875
Murder.

692
00:49:48.166 --> 00:49:49.208
I'm joking.

693
00:49:49.291 --> 00:49:53.500
I already went to jail for that.
I came here after I got out.

694
00:50:02.083 --> 00:50:03.333
It's not like that.

695
00:50:03.416 --> 00:50:05.291
I study Chinese in Beijing.

696
00:50:05.375 --> 00:50:08.291
I have some free days.
so I'm visiting here.

697
00:50:08.375 --> 00:50:10.416
Oh. I see.

698
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.458
Have you ever tasted local rice wine?

699
00:50:14.166 --> 00:50:16.083
No. I haven't.

700
00:50:19.125 --> 00:50:19.958
Hey. miss.

701
00:50:20.041 --> 00:50:23.708
A bottle of Nuerhong.

702
00:50:27.625 --> 00:50:28.625
This is yours.

703
00:50:29.333 --> 00:50:32.500
Nice to meet you. Miss...?

704
00:50:32.583 --> 00:50:33.541
I'm Joy.

705
00:50:41.291 --> 00:50:42.416
I'm Charlie.

706
00:50:44.958 --> 00:50:45.958
And I'm...

707
00:50:46.958 --> 00:50:47.916
Ricky.

708
00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.291
Are you together?

709
00:50:54.958 --> 00:50:56.291
Yes. we are together.

710
00:51:01.208 --> 00:51:02.875
I have to apologize.

711
00:51:02.958 --> 00:51:08.000
I just saw that Joy
has been sitting alone for a while.

712
00:51:08.083 --> 00:51:11.625
So I just wanted to keep her company.

713
00:51:12.458 --> 00:51:13.666
The more. the merrier.

714
00:51:17.416 --> 00:51:20.375
Is it just the two of you?

715
00:51:20.458 --> 00:51:22.083
Just the two of us.

716
00:51:22.166 --> 00:51:23.166
How about you?

717
00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:25.416
I have a friend with me.

718
00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:29.166
There he is.

719
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:30.791
Hey. Steve.

720
00:51:36.041 --> 00:51:38.041
Are you both Thai?

721
00:51:38.875 --> 00:51:41.541
I heard you speak Thai at the card table.

722
00:51:41.625 --> 00:51:43.458
Don't worry. Everything's okay.

723
00:51:47.833 --> 00:51:48.666
May I?

724
00:51:56.208 --> 00:51:57.208
Let's drink.

725
00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:00.083
What a douche.

726
00:52:00.708 --> 00:52:05.083
Where are you planning to visit?

727
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.291
Just around here. nothing special.

728
00:52:08.791 --> 00:52:09.875
No. No. No.

729
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.125
I heard that you're going to a village.

730
00:52:15.166 --> 00:52:17.125
Is there a village worth visiting here?

731
00:52:17.208 --> 00:52:18.583
Xiao Xan village.

732
00:52:22.708 --> 00:52:25.708
Xiao Xan village. Where is it?

733
00:52:25.791 --> 00:52:29.166
What's so special about it?

734
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:32.041
We're going there for business.

735
00:52:32.125 --> 00:52:35.833
I'm sorry. what kind of business?

736
00:52:37.125 --> 00:52:40.666
Sorry. but it's none of your concern.

737
00:52:45.541 --> 00:52:49.833
I'm sorry for intruding

738
00:52:49.916 --> 00:52:55.250
but I heard that in the old days.

739
00:52:55.333 --> 00:52:58.416
there was a group of bandits
called the Black Beards

740
00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:01.916
and they hid in a village in this area.

741
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.416
The leader raided many places
and got many treasures.

742
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:10.041
But in the end.
almost all of it was seized.

743
00:53:10.125 --> 00:53:13.208
There are some incredibly
valuable treasures

744
00:53:13.291 --> 00:53:15.375
that have not been found until now.

745
00:53:17.333 --> 00:53:18.833
Rumor has it.

746
00:53:20.041 --> 00:53:24.291
these treasures are hidden

747
00:53:24.375 --> 00:53:26.833
near the village
they used as their hideout.

748
00:53:28.833 --> 00:53:31.833
Have you ever heard this story?

749
00:53:34.083 --> 00:53:34.916
I haven't.

750
00:53:35.375 --> 00:53:38.125
No. Where did you hear it from?

751
00:53:46.416 --> 00:53:47.958
Never mind.

752
00:53:48.041 --> 00:53:50.291
It could be a made-up story.

753
00:53:50.375 --> 00:53:56.791
But if it's true. we still don't know
where to find these treasures.

754
00:53:56.875 --> 00:53:59.875
Unless someone knows where they're hidden

755
00:54:00.625 --> 00:54:03.291
or there's a treasure map.

756
00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:06.083
But there isn't.

757
00:54:09.333 --> 00:54:11.083
Sounds like a movie.

758
00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:16.666
Some movies are based on a true story.

759
00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:20.666
When I first walked in.
I saw that you were looking at a map.

760
00:54:21.125 --> 00:54:22.291
What is the map of?

761
00:54:25.916 --> 00:54:28.125
It's a map of the town here.

762
00:54:28.208 --> 00:54:30.208
I see. a map of the town.

763
00:54:35.791 --> 00:54:39.250
By the way. what are you two doing here?

764
00:54:42.583 --> 00:54:44.666
I don't think it's any of your business.

765
00:54:53.583 --> 00:54:59.000
My brother here is a funny man.
Don't mind him.

766
00:54:59.083 --> 00:55:02.750
We're just tourists like you guys.

767
00:55:03.416 --> 00:55:04.458
Please.

768
00:55:04.958 --> 00:55:05.791
Thank you.

769
00:55:11.583 --> 00:55:12.416
It's okay.

770
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Excuse me.

771
00:55:32.083 --> 00:55:34.250
I think we should get going.

772
00:55:34.333 --> 00:55:36.125
We have to get up early. right?

773
00:55:37.208 --> 00:55:38.041
Good luck.

774
00:55:46.958 --> 00:55:49.583
Remember me?

775
00:55:50.791 --> 00:55:52.625
I don't want any trouble!

776
00:56:27.041 --> 00:56:28.208
I'm sorry.

777
00:56:29.375 --> 00:56:32.958
When I was drunk.
I may have talked a bit too much.

778
00:56:39.625 --> 00:56:41.416
Will we really get there with this?

779
00:56:42.125 --> 00:56:47.000
Of course. BJ 2023.
chosen by the Chinese army.

780
00:56:47.083 --> 00:56:50.375
Very durable.
It has taken us all over the country.

781
00:56:50.458 --> 00:56:51.708
Don't you worry.

782
00:57:34.791 --> 00:57:36.583
-Why did you stop?
-I think...

783
00:57:39.125 --> 00:57:40.083
it broke down.

784
00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:43.083
BJ what?

785
00:57:43.166 --> 00:57:46.416
BJ 2023. chosen by the Chinese army.

786
00:58:14.083 --> 00:58:16.208
Seems like we'll have to walk.

787
00:58:19.041 --> 00:58:20.375
How far?

788
00:58:21.625 --> 00:58:23.208
We've come quite far already.

789
00:58:23.916 --> 00:58:25.375
It's farther if we go back.

790
00:58:41.041 --> 00:58:43.250
You can't wheel it
like you're at the airport.

791
00:58:44.166 --> 00:58:46.125
You'll end up leaving it halfway through.

792
00:58:46.208 --> 00:58:47.250
Hey. Hey. Hey.

793
00:58:47.333 --> 00:58:49.000
Take only what you need.

794
00:58:59.541 --> 00:59:00.375
What are you doing?

795
00:59:01.666 --> 00:59:02.625
Keeping it hidden.

796
00:59:04.125 --> 00:59:05.125
What for?

797
00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:06.375
It might get stolen.

798
00:59:06.458 --> 00:59:08.333
Who would steal it? Monkeys?

799
00:59:08.416 --> 00:59:09.416
Zombies.

800
00:59:09.916 --> 00:59:11.041
BJ 2023...

801
00:59:11.125 --> 00:59:13.625
Enough. Let's go.

802
00:59:44.958 --> 00:59:46.166
Stop.

803
00:59:47.833 --> 00:59:49.125
-Why?
-I'm tired.

804
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.416
Again? You can't keep stopping
every 100 meters.

805
00:59:56.666 --> 00:59:58.166
But I'm tired.

806
01:00:01.708 --> 01:00:03.000
What a burden.

807
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.333
Do you exercise at all?

808
01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:08.916
Look at you. you think we're shopping?

809
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.791
So difficult.
The rest of us have no issues.

810
01:00:16.166 --> 01:00:17.000
Yeah.

811
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.875
I don't think we can go any farther.

812
01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:30.000
It's almost dark
and it's going to rain soon.

813
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.750
Let's find shelter.

814
01:00:31.833 --> 01:00:33.291
Are there hotels around here?

815
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.750
Just kidding.

816
01:00:37.833 --> 01:00:39.125
This is your fault.

817
01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:42.208
You stopped to rest so often
that we couldn't make it very far.

818
01:00:43.125 --> 01:00:46.083
That's not fair.
Jackie couldn't walk either.

819
01:01:14.291 --> 01:01:15.125
What are you doing?

820
01:01:15.583 --> 01:01:17.541
-It's for grilling chicken.
-What chicken?

821
01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:29.291
-You brought a chicken?
-I'm well-prepared.

822
01:01:29.375 --> 01:01:31.000
-The whole chicken?
-Yes.

823
01:01:33.416 --> 01:01:34.791
-Are you thirsty?
-Why?

824
01:01:36.833 --> 01:01:38.916
Just picked this or brought it from home?

825
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.041
From home.

826
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.666
Coconut juice.

827
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:45.500
So refreshing. good for young ladies.

828
01:01:45.958 --> 01:01:46.916
Trust me.

829
01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:22.333
No.

830
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.125
Just a little bit.

831
01:02:37.208 --> 01:02:38.458
What a waste.

832
01:02:42.416 --> 01:02:43.291
Are you okay?

833
01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:54.083
Seriously...

834
01:02:54.791 --> 01:02:57.583
have you ever gone hiking
or done something like this before?

835
01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.708
It doesn't seem like you have.

836
01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:03.291
Evidently. you seem to be
just a cute little secretary.

837
01:03:06.833 --> 01:03:08.875
I was a workaholic when I was in Thailand.

838
01:03:08.958 --> 01:03:10.250
A salary woman.

839
01:03:11.208 --> 01:03:13.375
I had no time to go on vacation.

840
01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:14.750
Did you like your job?

841
01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:18.458
Not all the time.

842
01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:21.958
Why did you stick with it then?

843
01:03:23.583 --> 01:03:25.208
But you kicked your boss. right?

844
01:03:25.708 --> 01:03:26.791
Now you're fired.

845
01:03:27.458 --> 01:03:28.833
You're free now.

846
01:03:30.791 --> 01:03:31.791
Yes.

847
01:03:33.291 --> 01:03:36.416
Now when you go back.
you can do whatever you want.

848
01:03:37.083 --> 01:03:38.291
Anything you want.

849
01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:42.125
It's not that easy.

850
01:03:45.458 --> 01:03:47.333
I'm still in debt.

851
01:03:50.208 --> 01:03:51.916
To do what I want.

852
01:03:52.583 --> 01:03:53.833
I need money.

853
01:03:54.666 --> 01:03:56.833
So I still have to work.

854
01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:01.125
So when you go back.
you'll find a new job?

855
01:04:02.666 --> 01:04:05.791
-I suppose.
-Though you won't be happy doing it?

856
01:04:07.125 --> 01:04:08.500
I guess.

857
01:04:09.791 --> 01:04:10.791
So boring.

858
01:04:11.291 --> 01:04:12.916
Oh. hey.

859
01:04:14.708 --> 01:04:18.583
Sometimes. we can't always
choose to do what we want.

860
01:04:19.291 --> 01:04:22.500
People these days only think of freedom.

861
01:04:22.583 --> 01:04:24.791
They only want to do what they like.

862
01:04:25.666 --> 01:04:27.833
We can't all be successful doing that.

863
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:32.791
What do you like then?

864
01:04:40.625 --> 01:04:41.583
Awkward.

865
01:04:45.166 --> 01:04:46.208
Damn it.

866
01:04:47.541 --> 01:04:48.708
Did you smoke all of it?

867
01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:51.250
All gone.

868
01:04:51.875 --> 01:04:53.375
While you were talking.

869
01:04:55.041 --> 01:04:56.375
"What do you like then?"

870
01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:22.208
I never asked you...

871
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:23.583
About?

872
01:05:24.416 --> 01:05:25.958
How did you end up in China?

873
01:05:27.875 --> 01:05:30.041
I wanted Khanom Chin. so I came here.

874
01:05:31.125 --> 01:05:32.041
Khanom Chin?

875
01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:34.041
They don't have it here.

876
01:05:34.125 --> 01:05:35.666
Yeah. I misunderstood.

877
01:05:36.833 --> 01:05:38.125
Seriously.

878
01:05:38.208 --> 01:05:39.708
How did you end up here?

879
01:05:41.791 --> 01:05:43.708
I travel all over.

880
01:05:43.791 --> 01:05:45.416
I've lived in many countries.

881
01:05:45.958 --> 01:05:48.083
I'm just here longer this time.

882
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:50.833
Why stay here so long?

883
01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.375
Why don't you go somewhere else?

884
01:05:54.458 --> 01:05:56.000
You said you like traveling?

885
01:05:56.875 --> 01:05:58.416
Or you met a girl here?

886
01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:03.041
Why do you search for treasures now?

887
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.083
When I first got here.

888
01:06:11.166 --> 01:06:12.625
I had a Chinese girlfriend.

889
01:06:13.291 --> 01:06:15.833
She sold her family's old treasures.

890
01:06:15.916 --> 01:06:19.083
She made so much money
and it got my attention. that's all.

891
01:06:19.166 --> 01:06:22.750
See. it's because of a girl.

892
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:27.708
-Have you found any?
-What?

893
01:06:27.791 --> 01:06:29.416
Cool treasure.

894
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.375
If I did. why would I be sitting here?

895
01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:32.500
Think about it.

896
01:06:33.458 --> 01:06:34.666
Then let me ask you this.

897
01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.583
If we got lucky
and found treasures from this map.

898
01:06:39.208 --> 01:06:40.416
what would you spend it on?

899
01:06:41.916 --> 01:06:44.125
I'd get my car back.

900
01:06:45.041 --> 01:06:46.916
Then I'll drive it around.

901
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.458
Go wherever I want to go.

902
01:06:49.166 --> 01:06:51.333
Stay here as long as I want.

903
01:06:51.416 --> 01:06:52.375
That's it.

904
01:06:55.625 --> 01:06:57.291
Don't you want to go back?

905
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:03.916
I don't know why I'd go back.

906
01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:12.833
You seem to value freedom.

907
01:07:15.625 --> 01:07:18.458
Why do you need to get back your old car?

908
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:22.041
If you have money.
why not just buy a new one?

909
01:07:31.125 --> 01:07:33.000
It was my dad's car.

910
01:07:34.958 --> 01:07:36.750
He drove it around the world.

911
01:07:37.291 --> 01:07:38.625
He went everywhere

912
01:07:41.125 --> 01:07:43.041
and it's the only thing he left me.

913
01:07:44.416 --> 01:07:45.916
I don't know where he is now.

914
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:50.833
What about you?

915
01:07:53.833 --> 01:07:54.666
Hey.

916
01:08:04.041 --> 01:08:05.083
She's asleep.

917
01:09:06.833 --> 01:09:08.125
Are these mushrooms edible?

918
01:09:08.208 --> 01:09:11.416
Yes. I picked them myself. Want some?

919
01:09:12.583 --> 01:09:13.875
A little.

920
01:09:27.916 --> 01:09:28.916
Yuck!

921
01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:31.083
This is bitter.

922
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.875
-Those are magic mushrooms. Don't eat it.
-What?

923
01:09:41.625 --> 01:09:43.583
Shit. how did I get these?

924
01:09:44.458 --> 01:09:46.083
I already ate it. what should I do?

925
01:09:46.833 --> 01:09:47.666
It should be okay.

926
01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.000
Right? You only had a little.

927
01:09:57.458 --> 01:09:58.375
Watch your step.

928
01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:50.166
Is this Xiao Xan village?

929
01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:52.541
What should we do. Rick?

930
01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.416
We should ask the locals

931
01:10:56.291 --> 01:10:58.041
if they recognize the figurines.

932
01:10:58.875 --> 01:11:02.583
If we're lucky.
we might find the last figurine here.

933
01:11:18.291 --> 01:11:21.208
Have you ever seen a figurine like this?

934
01:11:21.291 --> 01:11:22.875
A cat figurine.

935
01:11:25.875 --> 01:11:26.958
Yes.

936
01:11:27.375 --> 01:11:28.375
I've seen it.

937
01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:33.416
Where have you seen it?

938
01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:02.833
Anyway. where have you seen it?

939
01:12:02.916 --> 01:12:06.458
According to our village's tradition.

940
01:12:06.541 --> 01:12:08.416
when you enter the village.

941
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:11.125
you have to drink three cups.

942
01:12:29.458 --> 01:12:31.250
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

943
01:12:32.166 --> 01:12:33.833
She is not well.

944
01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:35.000
I'll drink on her behalf.

945
01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:43.833
Now. can you tell us?

946
01:12:51.291 --> 01:12:53.833
Each... drinks three cups.

947
01:12:55.541 --> 01:12:57.375
Can we skip this?

948
01:13:02.291 --> 01:13:03.458
Of course.

949
01:13:14.916 --> 01:13:17.625
-How can a villager have a gun?
-Right?

950
01:13:18.333 --> 01:13:19.750
It's a custom-made pistol.

951
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:21.875
For bird shooting.

952
01:13:21.958 --> 01:13:23.750
Don't tell anyone.

953
01:13:29.416 --> 01:13:31.375
Damn. how many cups has it been?

954
01:13:31.458 --> 01:13:33.375
Don't know. I lost count.

955
01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:36.875
Drink more.

956
01:13:37.833 --> 01:13:41.416
You are our guests now.

957
01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.083
Tonight.

958
01:13:43.166 --> 01:13:47.958
we celebrate our annual celebration.

959
01:13:48.208 --> 01:13:53.166
You have to stay and celebrate with us.

960
01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:55.750
Celebration?

961
01:13:58.166 --> 01:14:00.000
I see. All right. all right.

962
01:14:01.458 --> 01:14:03.250
But where can we stay?

963
01:14:04.208 --> 01:14:06.708
You can stay here. Don't worry.

964
01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:08.708
He can understand Thai.

965
01:14:11.291 --> 01:14:14.375
When we are drunk.
we can understand everything.

966
01:14:14.833 --> 01:14:15.958
Hey.

967
01:14:18.166 --> 01:14:21.791
So. where did you see the cat figurine?

968
01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:22.708
What cat figurine?

969
01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:23.791
What?

970
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:26.875
Cat figurine? I've seen it.

971
01:14:27.625 --> 01:14:30.125
When I was a kid...

972
01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:32.625
So how many years?

973
01:14:35.208 --> 01:14:36.333
Should be around...

974
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.666
over 40 years ago.

975
01:14:39.916 --> 01:14:41.458
He can understand Thai again.

976
01:14:41.541 --> 01:14:42.458
He's smart.

977
01:14:43.041 --> 01:14:44.375
Try to think of where you saw it.

978
01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:45.875
A cat figurine.

979
01:14:47.541 --> 01:14:49.750
Where did you see it?

980
01:14:50.625 --> 01:14:51.625
A cat figurine.

981
01:14:55.083 --> 01:14:55.916
I can't remember.

982
01:14:57.708 --> 01:14:59.416
Can't remember?

983
01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.250
I drank
until I couldn't see straight. Wang.

984
01:15:02.416 --> 01:15:04.416
Let me think.

985
01:15:05.541 --> 01:15:07.750
I can't remember now

986
01:15:08.208 --> 01:15:09.333
but...

987
01:15:09.416 --> 01:15:10.500
why do you ask?

988
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:13.041
We are antique collectors.

989
01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:14.041
That's right.

990
01:15:14.125 --> 01:15:15.208
Oh. really?

991
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.958
Jackie is a millionaire antique collector.

992
01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:24.000
Yes. since I was this little.

993
01:15:24.083 --> 01:15:25.791
First. I collected postal stamps.

994
01:15:25.875 --> 01:15:28.083
After that. World Cup cards.

995
01:15:28.166 --> 01:15:31.250
Then CDs. and secondhand shoes.

996
01:15:31.333 --> 01:15:33.958
Finally. nowadays. I collect antiques.

997
01:15:35.208 --> 01:15:37.166
What did you say?

998
01:15:40.791 --> 01:15:41.833
That's my daughter.

999
01:15:42.125 --> 01:15:43.500
Mei Qing.

1000
01:16:01.291 --> 01:16:02.375
Mei Qing.

1001
01:16:13.583 --> 01:16:16.125
What do you know about Zhang Bao Lin?

1002
01:16:16.416 --> 01:16:17.833
Of course I know him.

1003
01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:23.791
He was the leader
of the Black Beard bandits.

1004
01:16:23.875 --> 01:16:25.000
This village

1005
01:16:25.625 --> 01:16:27.166
is built by him.

1006
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:28.625
We still keep

1007
01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:30.708
the house he lived in.

1008
01:16:30.791 --> 01:16:32.625
-Where is it?
-Over there.

1009
01:16:34.833 --> 01:16:35.750
I got it.

1010
01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:40.750
Zhang Bao Lin...

1011
01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:21.000
When he got up. I asked him again.

1012
01:17:21.083 --> 01:17:22.958
He can't seem to remember anything.

1013
01:17:24.291 --> 01:17:25.625
He also asked the others.

1014
01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:27.458
Nobody knows a thing. Rick.

1015
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:30.666
Where is Joy?

1016
01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:53.125
We celebrate this every year.

1017
01:18:53.208 --> 01:18:55.000
You've come on the right day.

1018
01:18:55.458 --> 01:18:57.458
I'm sure you'll like it.

1019
01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:01.041
This is Zhang Bao Lin's house.

1020
01:19:01.125 --> 01:19:03.208
It's permanently closed.

1021
01:19:03.708 --> 01:19:05.708
Nobody is allowed in.

1022
01:19:06.166 --> 01:19:07.375
Zhang Bao Lin's house.

1023
01:19:08.625 --> 01:19:10.125
Could it be inside the house?

1024
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:11.375
Jackie.

1025
01:19:13.333 --> 01:19:14.458
Zhang Bao Lin's house.

1026
01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:46.083
-Find anything?
-Nope.

1027
01:19:46.958 --> 01:19:48.166
Me neither.

1028
01:19:48.791 --> 01:19:51.250
-We'll find one if we stay longer.
-The figurine?

1029
01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:52.333
Ghosts.

1030
01:19:54.166 --> 01:19:55.708
Now is not the time.

1031
01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:59.541
Hey. check this out.

1032
01:20:03.333 --> 01:20:04.166
Shit.

1033
01:20:04.583 --> 01:20:05.791
Shit. this is...

1034
01:20:12.166 --> 01:20:13.416
Toon.

1035
01:20:14.791 --> 01:20:16.541
Zhang Bao Lin! This is his home.

1036
01:20:17.083 --> 01:20:18.791
Why would Toon be in China?

1037
01:20:24.875 --> 01:20:26.916
Why is there no clue here at all?

1038
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:30.916
The figurine might not be here.

1039
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.083
It might have been sold already.
Nobody would have known.

1040
01:20:46.625 --> 01:20:50.625
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

1041
01:20:50.708 --> 01:20:52.291
Let's go.

1042
01:20:52.375 --> 01:20:57.208
You'll miss the performance
of Xiao Xan 48.

1043
01:20:57.375 --> 01:20:58.208
What is it?

1044
01:20:58.291 --> 01:21:00.041
Xiao Xan 48.

1045
01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:01.666
Is Mei Qing a member?

1046
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:03.708
She is the captain.

1047
01:21:03.958 --> 01:21:05.041
Awesome.

1048
01:21:05.125 --> 01:21:06.958
She's my daughter after all.

1049
01:21:07.458 --> 01:21:08.583
Awesome.

1050
01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:10.250
Let's go.

1051
01:22:25.125 --> 01:22:27.500
So pretty.

1052
01:22:27.833 --> 01:22:29.375
Who is pretty?

1053
01:22:30.166 --> 01:22:31.000
Well. they are pretty.

1054
01:22:31.125 --> 01:22:34.291
I was pretty too.
I was the village's beauty queen.

1055
01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:36.416
Since I married you. I look like this now.

1056
01:22:37.625 --> 01:22:39.500
Wait till you get home.

1057
01:22:39.583 --> 01:22:40.416
She's going.

1058
01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:42.916
-She's jealous.
-Yeah.

1059
01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:42.666
I remember.

1060
01:23:43.416 --> 01:23:44.250
What?

1061
01:23:44.708 --> 01:23:46.666
I remember where I saw the figurine.

1062
01:23:46.875 --> 01:23:47.708
Where is it?

1063
01:23:54.125 --> 01:23:55.041
Wake up.

1064
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.125
Where?

1065
01:23:58.291 --> 01:24:00.125
I may have seen it at the shrine

1066
01:24:00.416 --> 01:24:02.666
Zhang Bao Lin built behind the village.

1067
01:24:04.333 --> 01:24:05.333
Mei Qing.

1068
01:24:05.416 --> 01:24:07.291
Have you eaten yet?

1069
01:24:11.833 --> 01:24:14.125
Come on. Rick. I'm asking her out.

1070
01:24:54.333 --> 01:24:55.166
Find it?

1071
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:56.750
No.

1072
01:24:56.833 --> 01:24:59.208
Damn. we've come so far.

1073
01:25:00.583 --> 01:25:04.083
If all three figurines were together.

1074
01:25:04.166 --> 01:25:06.875
but they were apart when they were sold.

1075
01:25:06.958 --> 01:25:09.750
that means somebody bought it already.

1076
01:25:11.541 --> 01:25:15.666
Or if the other two were stolen.
the third one must still be here.

1077
01:25:16.541 --> 01:25:19.375
Or was it stolen again later on?

1078
01:25:19.458 --> 01:25:21.666
So many possibilities. I'm confused.

1079
01:25:26.916 --> 01:25:30.916
Hey. That's Zhang Bao Lin's wife.

1080
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.541
Zhao Cao Qian.

1081
01:25:34.666 --> 01:25:38.083
Or are there actually only two figurines?

1082
01:25:41.875 --> 01:25:44.833
From the picture at his house.
there are two children.

1083
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:48.583
Or he made a figurine for each child

1084
01:25:49.875 --> 01:25:51.708
and each has a part of the treasure map.

1085
01:25:51.791 --> 01:25:55.791
I see. Each treasure map
will bring the children back here.

1086
01:25:57.416 --> 01:25:58.875
If we put them together.

1087
01:25:58.958 --> 01:26:02.416
it will tell us the hidden spot
of the third map.

1088
01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:03.500
Jack.

1089
01:26:03.583 --> 01:26:04.750
What's this?

1090
01:26:04.833 --> 01:26:06.500
It means a sign.

1091
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:08.083
And this?

1092
01:26:08.166 --> 01:26:10.041
Mother.

1093
01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:11.666
Sign and mother.

1094
01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:14.333
-Mother's left behind.
-Poor thing.

1095
01:26:14.416 --> 01:26:16.166
She was left raising two kids.

1096
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:17.250
That's a widow.

1097
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:19.583
The sign.

1098
01:26:19.666 --> 01:26:21.041
The sign of mother!

1099
01:26:25.208 --> 01:26:26.375
It is in there.

1100
01:26:48.333 --> 01:26:50.916
Hey. this is serious.

1101
01:26:56.291 --> 01:26:57.375
Hey.

1102
01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:15.083
There.

1103
01:27:15.666 --> 01:27:16.708
Like a comedy.

1104
01:27:31.125 --> 01:27:33.500
The third part of the treasure map.

1105
01:27:40.375 --> 01:27:42.083
You are the best.

1106
01:27:42.166 --> 01:27:44.458
So smart. Like Forrest Gump.

1107
01:27:44.916 --> 01:27:46.541
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1108
01:27:49.791 --> 01:27:50.708
Hey.

1109
01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:54.333
I have seen this mountain. It's nearby.

1110
01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:01.000
What is this?

1111
01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:04.291
The Night Jungle.

1112
01:28:12.083 --> 01:28:13.000
Wang.

1113
01:28:13.208 --> 01:28:14.041
Uncle Wang.

1114
01:28:14.541 --> 01:28:16.291
Do you know the Night Jungle?

1115
01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:17.791
The Night Jungle?

1116
01:28:17.875 --> 01:28:19.375
What the hell is that?

1117
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:22.208
Is there a jungle around here
with that name?

1118
01:28:22.291 --> 01:28:23.291
I'm not sure.

1119
01:28:23.958 --> 01:28:25.875
You are delusional.

1120
01:28:26.375 --> 01:28:27.291
Drink.

1121
01:28:31.708 --> 01:28:32.833
Let's think about it.

1122
01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.791
What's your name. son?

1123
01:28:38.833 --> 01:28:40.708
You are such a pussy. Jackie.

1124
01:28:40.791 --> 01:28:42.541
Your daughter is so pretty.

1125
01:28:42.625 --> 01:28:44.333
What a pussy.

1126
01:28:44.416 --> 01:28:46.791
Stand still.

1127
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
And you said don't tell anyone.

1128
01:28:53.083 --> 01:28:54.541
But you're firing the gun.

1129
01:28:54.833 --> 01:28:57.041
Wanna try?

1130
01:29:01.083 --> 01:29:03.333
Hello. everyone.

1131
01:29:03.416 --> 01:29:04.875
I have something to tell you.

1132
01:29:04.958 --> 01:29:06.375
Today is a good day.

1133
01:29:06.458 --> 01:29:08.125
We have to celebrate!

1134
01:29:14.375 --> 01:29:16.000
I feel like I'm 14 again.

1135
01:29:16.083 --> 01:29:17.166
What the hell?

1136
01:29:23.333 --> 01:29:25.083
I shot my leg!

1137
01:29:34.083 --> 01:29:36.583
At least it wasn't in a vital spot.

1138
01:29:36.958 --> 01:29:39.875
You'll be able to walk soon.

1139
01:29:45.375 --> 01:29:46.833
I won't be able to continue.

1140
01:29:46.916 --> 01:29:48.750
You two just go ahead.

1141
01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:51.166
I'm sorry that I can't help you anymore.

1142
01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:53.500
Even if I go with you. I'll be a burden.

1143
01:29:55.541 --> 01:29:56.541
Ricky.

1144
01:29:58.458 --> 01:30:00.916
Don't forget about my cut.

1145
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.125
-We'll entrust him to your care.
-Sure.

1146
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:09.875
And...

1147
01:30:11.166 --> 01:30:14.000
do you have a car I can borrow?

1148
01:31:07.166 --> 01:31:08.333
Are you sure it's a car?

1149
01:31:08.416 --> 01:31:10.041
Come on. it can run.

1150
01:31:10.541 --> 01:31:12.750
I can run. why don't you call me a car?

1151
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:14.750
So sarcastic.

1152
01:31:18.958 --> 01:31:21.458
It hurts so much.

1153
01:31:22.791 --> 01:31:23.833
Right here too.

1154
01:31:24.208 --> 01:31:26.125
-Still hurts?
-Yes.

1155
01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:29.333
Can you blow here?

1156
01:31:36.458 --> 01:31:37.958
Do you remember us?

1157
01:31:39.375 --> 01:31:40.833
Where is your friend?

1158
01:31:40.916 --> 01:31:41.958
You guys...

1159
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:50.375
Tell us if you don't want to get hurt.

1160
01:31:51.583 --> 01:31:52.833
Don't hurt us.

1161
01:31:58.458 --> 01:31:59.333
Thank you.

1162
01:32:09.708 --> 01:32:11.958
Are you sure we're going the right way?

1163
01:32:12.041 --> 01:32:15.041
Who am I supposed to ask now?

1164
01:32:15.833 --> 01:32:18.333
The villagers told me it's this way.

1165
01:32:18.416 --> 01:32:20.083
I'm following their directions.

1166
01:32:20.166 --> 01:32:22.375
Just keep driving. we'll find it.

1167
01:32:22.458 --> 01:32:24.416
Believe me.

1168
01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:25.791
Stop complaining.

1169
01:32:28.208 --> 01:32:29.916
-You complain more than I do.
-What?

1170
01:32:31.625 --> 01:32:33.791
This country is so big.

1171
01:32:34.458 --> 01:32:36.666
It will be a coincidence if we find them.

1172
01:32:41.333 --> 01:32:42.625
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1173
01:32:44.250 --> 01:32:45.875
Is it the mountain?

1174
01:33:02.375 --> 01:33:03.541
What the hell?

1175
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.833
Hey. bro. right at the bridge?

1176
01:33:06.916 --> 01:33:08.083
Look. is that them?

1177
01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:10.083
Let's go.

1178
01:33:18.291 --> 01:33:19.291
Let's see.

1179
01:33:19.375 --> 01:33:20.208
Let's go.

1180
01:33:22.125 --> 01:33:24.000
Hey. that's them.

1181
01:33:34.708 --> 01:33:37.250
How did you get here?

1182
01:33:37.958 --> 01:33:38.958
Driving. of course.

1183
01:33:39.041 --> 01:33:40.291
I see.

1184
01:33:40.375 --> 01:33:41.625
Are you on a trip?

1185
01:33:41.708 --> 01:33:43.666
What a coincidence.

1186
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:46.458
No. we followed you here.

1187
01:33:48.458 --> 01:33:49.541
We want the treasure map.

1188
01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:52.583
What treasure map?

1189
01:33:54.666 --> 01:33:56.583
High-pitched. you're lying.

1190
01:33:56.666 --> 01:33:58.291
We know all about the treasure map.

1191
01:33:58.375 --> 01:34:01.083
Give it to us
and we will take it from here.

1192
01:34:01.541 --> 01:34:02.416
Hand it over.

1193
01:34:04.208 --> 01:34:06.750
Isn't that too convenient?

1194
01:34:06.833 --> 01:34:08.625
Just hand it over.

1195
01:34:09.875 --> 01:34:11.291
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

1196
01:34:12.583 --> 01:34:14.250
Damn it. Steve.

1197
01:34:15.541 --> 01:34:16.916
Hey. stop.

1198
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.916
Steve. follow them.

1199
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.166
-Why did you get in my way?
-Get in.

1200
01:34:33.583 --> 01:34:35.375
Shoot them! Shoot!

1201
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:40.500
Where did he learn to swerve?

1202
01:34:43.583 --> 01:34:45.000
Hey. stop.

1203
01:34:46.583 --> 01:34:47.791
Go faster.

1204
01:34:47.875 --> 01:34:48.791
This is the fastest it can go.

1205
01:34:50.583 --> 01:34:51.541
Hey.

1206
01:35:02.416 --> 01:35:04.041
Hurry up. They're getting away.

1207
01:35:04.125 --> 01:35:05.791
-Damn it.
-Steve.

1208
01:35:06.208 --> 01:35:08.541
Damn it.

1209
01:35:10.083 --> 01:35:10.916
Steve.

1210
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.791
-Next time...
-Just a moment.

1211
01:35:12.875 --> 01:35:14.333
...find a better car!

1212
01:35:14.416 --> 01:35:16.500
No car can handle this road.

1213
01:35:16.583 --> 01:35:17.833
A four-wheel drive?

1214
01:35:17.916 --> 01:35:19.958
-Money?
-I will give it to you. Shit!

1215
01:35:20.041 --> 01:35:23.000
-"I will." But you never do.
-Hurry up.

1216
01:35:23.083 --> 01:35:24.125
Where did they go?

1217
01:35:26.041 --> 01:35:27.083
This way.

1218
01:35:30.041 --> 01:35:31.791
A four-wheeler would've done the job.

1219
01:35:31.875 --> 01:35:34.208
-Where are they?
-This way.

1220
01:35:34.291 --> 01:35:35.250
We got them.

1221
01:35:36.250 --> 01:35:37.166
Come on. Steve.

1222
01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:14.583
Follow me.

1223
01:36:14.666 --> 01:36:17.416
A bridge this old. if the wood breaks...

1224
01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.125
No. it won't.

1225
01:36:19.208 --> 01:36:20.458
Or it would've been broken already.

1226
01:36:21.083 --> 01:36:21.958
Come on.

1227
01:36:22.708 --> 01:36:23.708
Let's see.

1228
01:36:30.041 --> 01:36:31.458
Hurry up. Just this one.

1229
01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:38.208
Hey.

1230
01:36:39.333 --> 01:36:40.166
Hey.

1231
01:36:43.125 --> 01:36:44.166
Hang on.

1232
01:36:48.208 --> 01:36:49.375
Hurry up. Steve.

1233
01:36:51.875 --> 01:36:53.333
Let's go. What's wrong?

1234
01:36:53.416 --> 01:36:54.916
-I can't let go.
-Why?

1235
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.166
I'm scared of heights.

1236
01:36:56.250 --> 01:36:57.875
Damn!

1237
01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.208
Hold tight. I'll get you.

1238
01:37:00.291 --> 01:37:01.250
Wait for me. bro.

1239
01:37:01.333 --> 01:37:02.375
Go. Take it easy.

1240
01:37:02.458 --> 01:37:04.333
Yeah. like that. Go.

1241
01:37:08.875 --> 01:37:10.041
Let's go.

1242
01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:12.750
Hey. they're getting away.

1243
01:37:16.541 --> 01:37:18.333
Damn it. Missed them again.

1244
01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:20.666
Shit!

1245
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:21.833
You can do it.

1246
01:37:21.916 --> 01:37:23.458
Close your eyes. Go!

1247
01:37:39.458 --> 01:37:40.625
We lost them.

1248
01:37:42.291 --> 01:37:44.166
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1249
01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:45.458
But you were shot.

1250
01:37:48.875 --> 01:37:51.000
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1251
01:37:51.833 --> 01:37:53.250
Let's find shelter.

1252
01:37:54.250 --> 01:37:55.625
Any hotels around here?

1253
01:37:58.208 --> 01:38:00.000
Just kidding.

1254
01:38:00.083 --> 01:38:01.208
Let's go.

1255
01:38:01.916 --> 01:38:04.458
Be careful.

1256
01:38:22.833 --> 01:38:24.041
How did they get here?

1257
01:38:42.375 --> 01:38:43.958
Look.

1258
01:38:46.625 --> 01:38:47.458
This must be it.

1259
01:38:50.083 --> 01:38:51.375
The Night Jungle.

1260
01:39:04.666 --> 01:39:05.666
What are you doing?

1261
01:39:06.833 --> 01:39:08.791
This is how to do it. I studied this.

1262
01:39:08.875 --> 01:39:09.958
Sterilize it.

1263
01:39:11.458 --> 01:39:12.541
Where did you study?

1264
01:39:12.958 --> 01:39:14.000
Are you all right?

1265
01:39:15.583 --> 01:39:16.750
I'm fine.

1266
01:39:18.583 --> 01:39:21.083
-It will hurt a bit.
-Easy. It's far from my heart.

1267
01:39:24.041 --> 01:39:26.208
-Damn it. bitch!
-Hey.

1268
01:39:26.291 --> 01:39:28.916
I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared.

1269
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.250
Can I continue?

1270
01:39:30.333 --> 01:39:31.541
Fuck this. asshole!

1271
01:39:31.625 --> 01:39:33.083
Why are you cursing?

1272
01:39:33.166 --> 01:39:35.458
I'm sorry. It slipped out of my mouth.

1273
01:39:36.833 --> 01:39:37.833
That's enough.

1274
01:39:39.291 --> 01:39:40.208
No fighting.

1275
01:39:42.333 --> 01:39:43.416
All right.

1276
01:39:53.166 --> 01:39:54.291
Why are you laughing?

1277
01:40:01.916 --> 01:40:04.875
Remember when I told you
I had a Chinese girlfriend?

1278
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.791
When I first got here.

1279
01:40:10.708 --> 01:40:12.291
I met her in Shanghai.

1280
01:40:13.208 --> 01:40:16.833
We were like two lost people.

1281
01:40:20.791 --> 01:40:21.708
How so?

1282
01:40:23.166 --> 01:40:25.750
I just got here. I didn't know anything.

1283
01:40:25.833 --> 01:40:28.958
She is Chinese.
but she knew nothing about Shanghai.

1284
01:40:29.041 --> 01:40:32.958
The thing is.
we were together for a while.

1285
01:40:34.125 --> 01:40:36.208
One day. when we were at home.

1286
01:40:37.791 --> 01:40:39.833
she said she was going to the mini-mart

1287
01:40:42.125 --> 01:40:43.625
to buy some instant noodles.

1288
01:40:47.375 --> 01:40:48.291
She never came back.

1289
01:40:49.791 --> 01:40:50.666
What?

1290
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.500
I haven't seen her since.

1291
01:40:58.208 --> 01:40:59.541
Don't know where she went.

1292
01:41:02.625 --> 01:41:04.166
Why did she ghost you?

1293
01:41:05.041 --> 01:41:06.333
I also want to know.

1294
01:41:08.416 --> 01:41:10.041
Never mind. it's been a long time.

1295
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:27.750
What about you?

1296
01:41:28.375 --> 01:41:30.083
Anything you'd like to share?

1297
01:41:30.166 --> 01:41:31.833
Boyfriend or something?

1298
01:41:32.458 --> 01:41:33.416
Nothing.

1299
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.041
Isn't that boring?

1300
01:41:55.708 --> 01:41:56.666
Beautiful. isn't it?

1301
01:41:58.583 --> 01:42:00.000
Incredibly beautiful.

1302
01:42:05.125 --> 01:42:07.083
Thanks for taking me with you.

1303
01:42:07.916 --> 01:42:10.708
Otherwise. I wouldn't have seen
anything like this.

1304
01:42:12.791 --> 01:42:14.458
I actually should apologize.

1305
01:42:14.958 --> 01:42:17.500
I brought you to a tough
and dangerous situation.

1306
01:42:18.375 --> 01:42:19.541
Come on.

1307
01:42:24.625 --> 01:42:27.250
When you wake up tomorrow.
and want to go back.

1308
01:42:27.333 --> 01:42:28.500
we can leave. all right?

1309
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:32.125
We are almost there.

1310
01:42:32.208 --> 01:42:33.916
We've come this far.

1311
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.958
I'm all right. What about you?

1312
01:42:37.041 --> 01:42:39.416
Oops. I'm sorry.

1313
01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:40.333
It's fine.

1314
01:42:40.833 --> 01:42:42.333
Enough. No fighting.

1315
01:42:56.458 --> 01:42:57.291
Joy.

1316
01:42:58.875 --> 01:42:59.708
Joy.

1317
01:43:01.333 --> 01:43:03.500
I'm going to refill the water
at the stream. I'll be back.

1318
01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:19.125
Hey.

1319
01:43:20.791 --> 01:43:21.833
Good morning.

1320
01:43:22.375 --> 01:43:25.000
I won't disturb your beauty sleep
for too long.

1321
01:43:25.083 --> 01:43:26.625
I only have one question.

1322
01:43:27.583 --> 01:43:28.666
Where is the treasure map?

1323
01:43:29.208 --> 01:43:31.916
Give it to me. and we'll leave.

1324
01:43:32.375 --> 01:43:34.916
Or if you don't mind.
you can come with us.

1325
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.625
We'd be more than happy.

1326
01:43:36.708 --> 01:43:37.958
Let me be frank.

1327
01:43:38.666 --> 01:43:40.500
I really like you.

1328
01:43:40.583 --> 01:43:42.583
Since I met you at the restaurant.

1329
01:43:43.208 --> 01:43:45.041
I wanted to be your friend.

1330
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.250
But that day is different from today.

1331
01:43:58.083 --> 01:43:59.083
Steve!

1332
01:43:59.166 --> 01:44:01.083
Please respect the original artist.

1333
01:44:01.166 --> 01:44:02.208
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

1334
01:44:02.291 --> 01:44:04.416
Step back. Don't get any closer.

1335
01:44:04.791 --> 01:44:06.750
Steve. You handle it.

1336
01:44:07.625 --> 01:44:09.458
Aren't you good with sharp objects?

1337
01:44:09.541 --> 01:44:10.416
Go on.

1338
01:44:11.083 --> 01:44:13.625
-Go on.
-Calm down.

1339
01:44:16.958 --> 01:44:18.958
Ouch. I can't.

1340
01:44:19.541 --> 01:44:21.416
-What?
-The gun.

1341
01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:22.375
You suck.

1342
01:44:22.458 --> 01:44:23.625
Why would I risk myself?

1343
01:44:24.250 --> 01:44:25.083
Hey.

1344
01:44:26.291 --> 01:44:27.166
There you go.

1345
01:44:27.250 --> 01:44:28.333
Go.

1346
01:44:28.416 --> 01:44:29.375
Where is it?

1347
01:44:29.833 --> 01:44:30.791
Found it?

1348
01:44:35.333 --> 01:44:36.750
Hey. Hey. Let go.

1349
01:44:36.833 --> 01:44:38.083
It's going to tear.

1350
01:44:38.541 --> 01:44:39.958
I said it's going to tear!

1351
01:44:40.375 --> 01:44:41.333
Shit!

1352
01:44:45.083 --> 01:44:46.000
Steve.

1353
01:44:46.083 --> 01:44:49.166
Ouch! It hurts.

1354
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:50.375
Get him.

1355
01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:02.416
-Steve.
-I got it.

1356
01:45:04.041 --> 01:45:06.375
Charlie. I can't.

1357
01:45:06.458 --> 01:45:07.416
Damn you.

1358
01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:09.291
-Hurry up. Help.
-Enough.

1359
01:45:11.708 --> 01:45:12.541
Hey.

1360
01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:17.041
Give me the treasure map
and I won't hurt you.

1361
01:45:19.333 --> 01:45:21.208
Otherwise. you can die here.

1362
01:45:22.041 --> 01:45:23.583
Nobody will find your body.

1363
01:45:23.666 --> 01:45:25.375
Someone will find us.

1364
01:45:25.458 --> 01:45:26.833
I said nobody. Wanna try me?

1365
01:45:27.541 --> 01:45:28.416
Give it to me.

1366
01:45:29.333 --> 01:45:30.458
Hurry up.

1367
01:45:31.125 --> 01:45:32.958
All right. I surrender.

1368
01:45:33.333 --> 01:45:34.291
Who do I give it to?

1369
01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:36.541
Give it to me.

1370
01:45:41.875 --> 01:45:43.000
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1371
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:46.875
I missed again.

1372
01:45:46.958 --> 01:45:47.791
Follow them?

1373
01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:49.791
Hey. Steve. Steve.

1374
01:45:50.833 --> 01:45:52.125
The map.

1375
01:45:52.208 --> 01:45:53.041
Steve.

1376
01:45:57.250 --> 01:46:00.958
Damn. custom-made pistol!

1377
01:46:01.041 --> 01:46:01.875
Damn it.

1378
01:46:06.541 --> 01:46:07.416
What is it?

1379
01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:08.916
It fired by accident.

1380
01:46:13.625 --> 01:46:14.708
What did you say?

1381
01:46:16.375 --> 01:46:17.208
What?

1382
01:46:18.375 --> 01:46:19.625
Damn it.

1383
01:46:25.625 --> 01:46:26.958
They might stop following us.

1384
01:46:32.583 --> 01:46:34.083
Which way do we go?

1385
01:46:34.541 --> 01:46:36.250
You burned the map.

1386
01:46:36.333 --> 01:46:37.708
I had to.

1387
01:46:38.875 --> 01:46:41.166
Don't worry. Here.

1388
01:46:42.666 --> 01:46:44.291
When did you take the photos?

1389
01:46:44.375 --> 01:46:48.041
From the Night Jungle to the northwest.

1390
01:46:48.125 --> 01:46:51.416
we'll find a cave with a waterfall inside.

1391
01:46:53.041 --> 01:46:54.500
-Where?
-Cave with waterfall.

1392
01:47:07.875 --> 01:47:09.000
Who is that?

1393
01:47:21.458 --> 01:47:22.750
I know.

1394
01:47:51.041 --> 01:47:52.166
Who are they?

1395
01:47:53.458 --> 01:47:54.916
They invaded our territory

1396
01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.125
and attacked one of our men.

1397
01:47:57.833 --> 01:47:59.041
Who are you?

1398
01:47:59.291 --> 01:48:00.250
How did you get here?

1399
01:48:00.625 --> 01:48:02.666
We're just lost.

1400
01:48:03.375 --> 01:48:04.833
Where are you going?

1401
01:48:05.291 --> 01:48:07.791
We are only here for a hike.

1402
01:48:08.125 --> 01:48:10.000
Nobody comes here to hike.

1403
01:48:11.208 --> 01:48:12.541
We do.

1404
01:48:13.583 --> 01:48:16.166
We have lived here peacefully
for a long time.

1405
01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:18.125
We don't want disturbances
from the outside.

1406
01:48:18.208 --> 01:48:20.750
We won't risk letting strangers in

1407
01:48:21.958 --> 01:48:23.750
to make this place unsafe.

1408
01:48:24.250 --> 01:48:25.166
Tell me...

1409
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:27.916
what should we do with the intruders?

1410
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.958
-Kill them.
-Kill them.

1411
01:48:30.041 --> 01:48:31.333
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1412
01:48:31.416 --> 01:48:32.583
Gouge out their eyes

1413
01:48:32.666 --> 01:48:33.833
so they can't come back.

1414
01:48:33.916 --> 01:48:35.125
Gouge out their eyes.

1415
01:48:35.208 --> 01:48:36.541
Calm down. Calm down.

1416
01:48:36.625 --> 01:48:38.541
-Let them go.
-Good.

1417
01:48:41.125 --> 01:48:42.750
And let the tigers eat them.

1418
01:48:42.833 --> 01:48:44.666
Let the tigers eat them.

1419
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:46.166
Are you joking?

1420
01:48:47.458 --> 01:48:50.125
We aren't barbarians.

1421
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:52.208
Don't hurt them.

1422
01:49:16.083 --> 01:49:17.833
If we let you go.

1423
01:49:18.583 --> 01:49:21.250
how do we know
that you won't bring us any trouble?

1424
01:49:23.875 --> 01:49:27.375
We promise that we won't talk about this.

1425
01:49:31.833 --> 01:49:33.000
Tomorrow morning.

1426
01:49:33.083 --> 01:49:35.125
you have to leave immediately.

1427
01:49:35.333 --> 01:49:36.791
But

1428
01:49:36.875 --> 01:49:38.750
since you attacked one of our men.

1429
01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:41.000
we'll have to ask him

1430
01:49:41.083 --> 01:49:42.041
what he wants to do.

1431
01:49:43.958 --> 01:49:46.208
-I want a duel.
-Duel!

1432
01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:47.791
What do you say?

1433
01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:53.833
Okay.

1434
01:49:55.875 --> 01:49:57.333
But I have a champion.

1435
01:50:12.708 --> 01:50:14.375
Is he allowed to swap?

1436
01:51:24.291 --> 01:51:27.125
If she hadn't helped us.
we'd be in trouble.

1437
01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:30.458
She's pretty.

1438
01:51:38.166 --> 01:51:39.083
Zu Lin.

1439
01:51:40.750 --> 01:51:42.708
Zu Lin is Chief Zhang's daughter.

1440
01:51:44.041 --> 01:51:46.333
How do you know her name?

1441
01:51:47.416 --> 01:51:48.250
We were together.

1442
01:52:23.833 --> 01:52:24.750
Zu Lin.

1443
01:52:37.541 --> 01:52:39.208
Where are the noodles?

1444
01:52:41.250 --> 01:52:45.333
One year. seven months. 14 days.

1445
01:52:47.916 --> 01:52:51.791
Your trip to buy noodles
is a world record.

1446
01:52:54.833 --> 01:52:57.250
I finished them a long time ago.

1447
01:52:58.375 --> 01:53:00.750
Why didn't you come back?

1448
01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:04.250
I didn't think

1449
01:53:04.333 --> 01:53:07.375
that we'd meet again.

1450
01:53:07.458 --> 01:53:10.208
The world is so big.
how could you be here?

1451
01:53:11.041 --> 01:53:13.541
I never thought I'd see you here.

1452
01:53:14.291 --> 01:53:16.291
If I wasn't able to see you again.

1453
01:53:16.375 --> 01:53:19.041
I wouldn't be able to get closure.

1454
01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:29.458
You value freedom.

1455
01:53:29.541 --> 01:53:31.833
You have goals in your life.

1456
01:53:31.916 --> 01:53:33.333
But I...

1457
01:53:34.125 --> 01:53:36.583
I can't join you on that path.

1458
01:53:37.791 --> 01:53:39.541
Why?

1459
01:53:40.791 --> 01:53:44.541
At the time.
I only wanted to live in the city.

1460
01:53:44.625 --> 01:53:47.625
Eventually. I would come back here.

1461
01:53:48.875 --> 01:53:51.541
Why didn't you just tell me?

1462
01:53:52.333 --> 01:53:53.916
If I did.

1463
01:53:55.041 --> 01:53:57.666
would you give up on your dreams for me?

1464
01:54:02.916 --> 01:54:07.750
I was also engaged to someone.

1465
01:54:10.875 --> 01:54:14.583
We grew up together here.

1466
01:54:16.708 --> 01:54:23.583
I wanted to see the world.
that's why I left him here.

1467
01:54:25.416 --> 01:54:27.000
But now.

1468
01:54:28.375 --> 01:54:31.166
we are married.

1469
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:35.000
Why did you lie to me?

1470
01:54:35.083 --> 01:54:40.041
I didn't think I'd come back here.

1471
01:54:40.125 --> 01:54:42.000
but it wasn't like that.

1472
01:54:42.083 --> 01:54:44.625
I can't forget the past here.

1473
01:54:44.708 --> 01:54:47.291
That was the only thing
I lied to you about.

1474
01:54:49.291 --> 01:54:51.625
But the feelings I had for you

1475
01:54:52.583 --> 01:54:55.208
were real.

1476
01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:59.875
I'm sorry.

1477
01:55:02.958 --> 01:55:05.333
I ran away without telling you

1478
01:55:07.416 --> 01:55:10.833
because I thought that if I did.

1479
01:55:11.625 --> 01:55:14.041
you would do anything to stop me.

1480
01:55:14.833 --> 01:55:17.875
So I had to leave without telling you.

1481
01:55:20.458 --> 01:55:23.791
I'm sorry.

1482
01:55:25.833 --> 01:55:30.083
I'm really sorry.

1483
01:55:32.708 --> 01:55:33.666
I'm sorry.

1484
01:55:43.333 --> 01:55:45.375
It's okay.

1485
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.333
It's okay.

1486
01:56:23.708 --> 01:56:25.000
Let's continue tomorrow.

1487
01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:36.833
She didn't go to buy noodles.

1488
01:56:45.458 --> 01:56:47.291
At least I know now. right?

1489
01:56:59.083 --> 01:57:01.000
-We're leaving.
-Good luck.

1490
01:57:46.375 --> 01:57:47.291
Watch your step.

1491
01:58:03.333 --> 01:58:04.333
Must be this cave.

1492
01:58:12.916 --> 01:58:14.916
Oh? What is it?

1493
01:58:16.833 --> 01:58:17.666
Nothing.

1494
01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:26.833
Hey.

1495
01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:55.291
This is a dead end.

1496
01:58:55.375 --> 01:58:57.625
The map shows that we have to go through

1497
01:58:57.708 --> 01:58:59.708
and we will find the Heavenly Reservoir.

1498
01:59:00.625 --> 01:59:01.791
Through the cave?

1499
01:59:04.333 --> 01:59:05.625
What's that?

1500
01:59:16.958 --> 01:59:17.791
A raft.

1501
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:37.833
Hey. there.

1502
01:59:53.541 --> 01:59:54.750
Which way?

1503
02:00:01.791 --> 02:00:02.708
Let's go here.

1504
02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:32.250
It should be out there.

1505
02:00:57.958 --> 02:00:59.333
The Heavenly Reservoir.

1506
02:01:00.208 --> 02:01:01.458
it could be that one.

1507
02:01:31.041 --> 02:01:32.333
There's something here.

1508
02:02:09.416 --> 02:02:10.458
Hey.

1509
02:02:20.208 --> 02:02:21.041
Hey.

1510
02:02:39.458 --> 02:02:40.875
Dragon's heart.

1511
02:02:45.666 --> 02:02:48.750
-We found it!
-We found it!

1512
02:02:48.833 --> 02:02:51.083
Dragon's heart!

1513
02:02:55.833 --> 02:02:56.666
Hey.

1514
02:03:00.291 --> 02:03:02.000
Hand it over now.

1515
02:03:02.083 --> 02:03:03.458
Nobody has to get hurt.

1516
02:03:03.541 --> 02:03:04.791
How did you get here?

1517
02:03:10.708 --> 02:03:12.041
I think we should talk.

1518
02:03:12.125 --> 02:03:13.666
No more talking.

1519
02:03:16.375 --> 02:03:18.291
Hand it over.

1520
02:03:30.875 --> 02:03:31.708
Fine.

1521
02:03:44.333 --> 02:03:45.208
How's that?

1522
02:03:48.708 --> 02:03:49.708
How's that?

1523
02:04:00.708 --> 02:04:01.666
How's that?

1524
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:03.250
How's that. bro?

1525
02:04:11.958 --> 02:04:13.583
Hurts. doesn't it?

1526
02:04:23.791 --> 02:04:24.708
Come here.

1527
02:04:33.875 --> 02:04:35.333
Hey.

1528
02:04:35.916 --> 02:04:37.666
Shit. Broken again.

1529
02:04:40.333 --> 02:04:42.583
Hey. handsome.

1530
02:04:50.833 --> 02:04:51.875
Hand it over.

1531
02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:56.708
Are you sure you should risk her life?

1532
02:04:57.625 --> 02:04:58.916
I don't think it's worth it.

1533
02:04:59.458 --> 02:05:02.166
Hand it over to us. Then we'll leave.

1534
02:05:02.250 --> 02:05:05.750
We won't hurt you. we promise.

1535
02:05:05.833 --> 02:05:06.875
Hand it over.

1536
02:05:09.916 --> 02:05:10.916
Hand it over.

1537
02:05:12.916 --> 02:05:13.916
Do it.

1538
02:05:20.250 --> 02:05:21.083
Steve.

1539
02:05:21.875 --> 02:05:22.791
Go.

1540
02:05:24.666 --> 02:05:25.625
Thank you very much.

1541
02:05:26.250 --> 02:05:27.875
See you next time.

1542
02:05:29.666 --> 02:05:30.875
Goodbye.

1543
02:05:44.125 --> 02:05:45.125
Hand it over.

1544
02:05:48.666 --> 02:05:50.625
Give back our jade.

1545
02:05:50.833 --> 02:05:51.750
Give it to him.

1546
02:05:53.625 --> 02:05:54.458
Go get it.

1547
02:06:12.416 --> 02:06:14.000
This jade is ours.

1548
02:06:18.083 --> 02:06:20.041
You can go now

1549
02:06:20.708 --> 02:06:22.625
and don't come back here again.

1550
02:06:32.125 --> 02:06:33.875
I told you. I was in jail in Thailand

1551
02:06:33.958 --> 02:06:35.125
and now here too!

1552
02:06:35.208 --> 02:06:36.500
I said I'm sorry.

1553
02:06:36.583 --> 02:06:37.666
Sorry then what?

1554
02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:39.125
Get in the car.

1555
02:06:39.208 --> 02:06:42.041
Damn you.

1556
02:06:42.125 --> 02:06:44.166
We didn't get any treasures. Damn it.

1557
02:06:44.250 --> 02:06:46.083
We didn't get any. so what?

1558
02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:48.708
Now we're going to jail.

1559
02:06:48.791 --> 02:06:49.833
Say "I'm sorry"?

1560
02:06:49.916 --> 02:06:51.625
Wow. you can speak Chinese.

1561
02:06:51.708 --> 02:06:53.208
I'm sorry.

1562
02:06:53.291 --> 02:06:54.375
Can you apologize?

1563
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.958
WELCOME TO SHANGHAI

1564
02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:47.333
Hey.

1565
02:07:49.041 --> 02:07:52.000
I'm sorry that I failed.

1566
02:07:52.916 --> 02:07:54.875
I put you through so much for nothing.

1567
02:07:55.500 --> 02:07:57.500
I said don't apologize.

1568
02:07:58.791 --> 02:08:00.500
We're partners.

1569
02:08:01.583 --> 02:08:03.000
We're both responsible.

1570
02:08:05.416 --> 02:08:08.333
Actually. this experience

1571
02:08:09.291 --> 02:08:11.250
means more to me.

1572
02:08:15.791 --> 02:08:17.916
Are you really going back?

1573
02:08:20.541 --> 02:08:22.708
Yeah. I have a lot to take care of

1574
02:08:23.958 --> 02:08:25.458
and I have to find a new job.

1575
02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.208
What about you?

1576
02:08:34.291 --> 02:08:36.375
I don't have anything left here.

1577
02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.416
I guess I'll keep traveling.

1578
02:08:59.375 --> 02:09:01.416
Don't go hiking again. okay?

1579
02:10:32.250 --> 02:10:33.416
Safe travels. all right?

1580
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:41.125
Safe travels.

1581
02:11:03.166 --> 02:11:04.208
I sold your car.

1582
02:11:09.916 --> 02:11:11.208
This is what's left.

1583
02:11:11.916 --> 02:11:13.375
You might want to keep it.

1584
02:11:13.458 --> 02:11:15.583
A client had a look on day six.

1585
02:11:16.416 --> 02:11:18.083
Down payment on day seven.

1586
02:11:18.666 --> 02:11:20.625
And drove away with it on day eight.

1587
02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:30.458
Slacking off again?

1588
02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.166
Get back to work.

1589
02:12:40.916 --> 02:12:42.208
Awesome.

1590
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:45.708
Do you normally eat something like this?

1591
02:12:46.791 --> 02:12:47.791
I can now.

1592
02:12:51.625 --> 02:12:53.541
Hey. at my friend's company.

1593
02:12:54.166 --> 02:12:57.125
she said they have an opening
for a secretary.

1594
02:12:57.208 --> 02:12:58.333
Are you interested?

1595
02:12:58.791 --> 02:13:03.666
I've been thinking
I don't want to be a secretary anymore.

1596
02:13:04.791 --> 02:13:05.625
Why?

1597
02:13:08.541 --> 02:13:11.166
I don't want to do something
I don't want to.

1598
02:13:11.666 --> 02:13:12.791
I'll be stressed again.

1599
02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:14.958
And your credit card debts?

1600
02:13:16.166 --> 02:13:17.583
I'll pay in installments.

1601
02:13:18.250 --> 02:13:23.083
I'll start selling anything unnecessary
and sell clothes on Instagram.

1602
02:13:24.541 --> 02:13:27.500
By the way. I've started writing.

1603
02:13:28.125 --> 02:13:30.291
A little bit. I'll send you samples.

1604
02:13:30.375 --> 02:13:31.666
What kind of book?

1605
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:32.791
A novel.

1606
02:13:50.291 --> 02:13:51.166
Hey.

1607
02:13:52.875 --> 02:13:54.458
Hey.

1608
02:13:54.541 --> 02:13:56.208
How did you get here?

1609
02:13:56.291 --> 02:13:57.833
I thought you were in Miami.

1610
02:13:58.666 --> 02:14:02.041
It's Miami Hotel on Sukhumvit 13.
I'm staying there.

1611
02:14:02.125 --> 02:14:03.583
I see.

1612
02:14:03.666 --> 02:14:05.750
I thought you weren't coming back
to Thailand.

1613
02:14:06.208 --> 02:14:07.875
I thought so too.

1614
02:14:07.958 --> 02:14:09.416
But I owe you some money.

1615
02:14:10.625 --> 02:14:15.333
I was gonna wire it. but then
I thought I should bring it myself.

1616
02:14:15.958 --> 02:14:17.875
You owe me money? Since when?

1617
02:14:17.958 --> 02:14:20.458
Well. at the antique shop.

1618
02:14:21.041 --> 02:14:22.250
100 yuan.

1619
02:14:22.333 --> 02:14:24.375
That's nothing.

1620
02:14:24.458 --> 02:14:25.291
It's fine.

1621
02:14:25.375 --> 02:14:26.458
No. take it.

1622
02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.125
And I also owe you one more thing.

1623
02:14:31.208 --> 02:14:32.250
What is it?

1624
02:14:32.333 --> 02:14:33.833
Your cut. We made a promise.

1625
02:14:34.458 --> 02:14:35.291
What for?

1626
02:14:35.375 --> 02:14:37.583
We're partners. Don't you remember?

1627
02:14:37.666 --> 02:14:40.083
Yes. but what is it for?

1628
02:14:41.125 --> 02:14:41.958
Do you...

1629
02:14:42.916 --> 02:14:46.125
remember the jar
that the dragon's heart was in?

1630
02:14:47.708 --> 02:14:51.041
I happen to have it in my bag.

1631
02:14:52.375 --> 02:14:57.000
And it happens to be an ancient item.
200 years old.

1632
02:15:01.250 --> 02:15:05.125
It's worth 3 million yuan.

1633
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:09.250
3 million yuan!

1634
02:15:16.666 --> 02:15:17.750
Three million yuan.

1635
02:15:17.833 --> 02:15:18.958
That's crazy.

1636
02:15:19.041 --> 02:15:21.625
Not so loud or we'll get robbed.

1637
02:15:23.916 --> 02:15:26.250
How have you been? Where did you go?

1638
02:15:26.333 --> 02:15:28.291
Oh. so many places.

1639
02:15:29.083 --> 02:15:30.166
Do you have time?

1640
02:15:30.250 --> 02:15:31.583
Yes. a lot.

1641
02:15:33.625 --> 02:15:35.416
Want to grab something
to eat to celebrate?

1642
02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:36.375
Yeah. let's go.

1643
02:15:37.750 --> 02:15:39.166
Here. my car.

1644
02:15:39.250 --> 02:15:40.625
-New car?
-New car.

1645
02:15:40.708 --> 02:15:41.625

-Because we have...

02:15:45.083 --> 02:15:46.583
Shush. don't be so loud.

1649
02:15:46.666 --> 02:15:48.166
You are the one who's loud.

1650
02:15:48.250 --> 02:15:49.291

1651
02:15:49.916 --> 02:15:53.000
