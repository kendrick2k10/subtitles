3
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.788
Thomas Zurbuchen is
the head of science at NASA.

4
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.958
or Dr. Z. as we can also call you.

5
00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:11.209
The day has come.

6
00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:13.836
All these decades. all this time.

7
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.964
all these people
working on this telescope.

8
00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.091
and here we are. minutes to launch.

9
00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:04.971
Ten. nine. eight…

10
00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:19.068
…three. two. one. liftoff!

11
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.033
We have been given
the go-ahead to begin commanding

12
00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.953
a release of the forward latches.

13
00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:58.668
We're seeing both blankets
unfurl on the solar array.

14
00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:00.670
Looks good.

15
00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:09.679
I want to wish Hubble
its own set of adventures.

16
00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:12.932
that it may unlock
further mysteries of the universe.

17
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.336
We want to look out
into the vastness of space

18
00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:09.215
and back to the beginnings of time
to answer the questions.

19
00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:13.469
"How did. and how do. galaxies form?"

20
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.932
"Are there other habitable planets
outside our solar system?"

21
00:09:18.849 --> 00:09:21.602
"Is life unique to planet Earth?"

22
00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:26.065
Hubble and ground-based telescopes
have given us an important start.

23
00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:27.942
But we must go farther.

24
00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:30.403
and the Next Generation Space Telescope.

25
00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:35.491
NGST. will be the next great step taken.

26
00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:35.384
Navigation confirmed
that the parachute has deployed

27
00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.845
and we are seeing
significant deceleration.

28
00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.899
Oh. it's beautiful. Mike.
it really is.

29
00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:53.152
They've got the flag up now.
and you can see the stars and stripes.

30
00:22:19.296 --> 00:22:22.132
This institute will be managing
a telescope

31
00:22:22.215 --> 00:22:24.801
with a launch projected for 2007.

32
00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:28.847
The target price for doing this
will be 500 million dollars.

33
00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:50.619
Mr. Howard. did you ever see
the movie called The Money Pit?

34
00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:52.996
Yes. absolutely.

35
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.125
I think the standard line in that movie
was. ''It's only two more weeks.''

36
00:22:57.209 --> 00:23:01.630
Mm-hmm. Now. how can we justify this
to our constituents?

37
00:28:20.573 --> 00:28:25.870
We are just about 12 hours from launching.
Fingers crossed that the weather holds.

38
00:28:25.954 --> 00:28:30.291
and we'll be able to launch
this telescope tomorrow morning.

39
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:34.087
I can't believe… I can't believe
that we're almost here.

40
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:37.132
I'm so excited. I can't wait
to get this telescope into space.

41
00:29:20.467 --> 00:29:23.303
Seven. six. five.

42
00:29:23.386 --> 00:29:27.849
four. three. two. one. liftoff.

43
00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:30.602
Ignition.

44
00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:37.317
Liftoff.

45
00:29:45.992 --> 00:29:49.788
All propulsion parameters
are normal. Trajectory is normal.

46
00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:55.353
The coolest thing
of the decade. possibly the century.

47
00:30:55.436 --> 00:30:56.563
is about to happen.

48
00:30:56.646 --> 00:30:58.314
The successor to the Hubble.

49
00:30:58.398 --> 00:31:01.109
three times as large
and way more technologically advanced.

50
00:31:01.192 --> 00:31:03.695
is about to be launched.
I'm going to start crying.

51
00:31:04.654 --> 00:31:08.741
Feliz Navidad. I got up
at 4:50 a.m. this morning

52
00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:10.785
to watch the JWST launch.

53
00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:14.873
Just praying to all the science gods
that everything goes without a hitch.

54
00:31:14.956 --> 00:31:17.792
and that in six months.
we'll be able to get this wonderful data.

55
00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:19.627
Merry Christmas. everyone.

56
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.043
Ten. nine. eight…

57
00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.020
ESC shutdown.

58
00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:44.731
All onboard parameters are normal.

59
00:33:59.912 --> 00:34:01.956
Separation of the Webb Telescope.

60
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.791
Go. Webb!

61
00:35:04.644 --> 00:35:06.938
Solar array is out.

62
00:35:07.021 --> 00:35:09.482
All right! All right!

63
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.448
Now we're talking!

64
00:46:15.856 --> 00:46:20.486
JWST has completed
all of its major deployments.

65
00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:23.572
Things are going spectacular.

66
00:46:23.655 --> 00:46:26.784
We have the biggest.
most complex observatory

67
00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:30.579
we've ever sent to space.
and we can expect some awesome images.

68
00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.081
Y'all. we did it!

69
00:47:24.049 --> 00:47:26.885
An embarrassingly blurred
Hubble Telescope.

70
00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:30.514
One of the telescope's two mirrors
is thought to be defective.

71
00:47:30.597 --> 00:47:32.057
blurring its images.

72
00:47:55.163 --> 00:47:56.790
Jeff. you'll have your hands full.

73
00:47:56.874 --> 00:47:59.376
You might wanna go ahead
and put your helmet lights on.

74
00:48:00.335 --> 00:48:01.378
Good idea.

75
00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:15.434
-One bright pixel.
- Right there!

76
00:48:16.768 --> 00:48:18.061
There. there. there.

77
00:48:18.145 --> 00:48:20.480
- We can see the pixels.
-We did it!

78
00:49:50.862 --> 00:49:53.699
Six months after
the most powerful telescope ever made

79
00:49:53.782 --> 00:49:55.158
launched into space.

80
00:49:55.242 --> 00:49:58.870
the team inside the Webb Space Telescope's
flight control room is preparing

81
00:49:58.954 --> 00:50:01.498
to reveal what astronomers
all over the world

82
00:50:01.581 --> 00:50:04.167
have been waiting for for decades.

83
00:50:04.251 --> 00:50:06.878
the telescope's first full-color images.

84
00:51:59.157 --> 00:52:02.911
Today. our understanding
of the universe is about to get clearer.

85
00:52:02.994 --> 00:52:05.038
It is.
President Biden's going to unveil

86
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:07.833
the much-anticipated
first full-color image

87
00:52:07.916 --> 00:52:10.127
from NASA's Webb Space Telescope.

88
00:54:06.868 --> 00:54:11.122
Today is a historic day
for America and all of humanity.

89
00:54:11.206 --> 00:54:12.374
We're gonna get a glimpse

90
00:54:12.457 --> 00:54:15.502
of the oldest documented light
in the history of the universe

91
00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:18.171
from over 13 billion--

92
00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:21.967
Let me say that again.
13 billion years ago.

93
00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:23.677
It's hard to even fathom.

94
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.554
And now let's take a look
at the very first image

95
00:54:26.638 --> 00:54:28.682
from this miraculous telescope.

96
00:54:47.325 --> 00:54:48.910
Oh my gosh!

97
00:54:48.994 --> 00:54:51.579
The first image
from the James Webb Space Telescope.

98
00:54:51.663 --> 00:54:53.164
And here it is.

99
00:54:53.248 --> 00:54:56.334
Uh. galaxies to the edge of time.

100
00:54:56.418 --> 00:54:58.336
Oh my gosh.

101
00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.796
Okay…

102
00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:10.724
It really is amazing.

103
00:55:11.725 --> 00:55:13.184
Oh. my God.

104
00:55:17.355 --> 00:55:18.398
I have no words.

105
00:55:19.024 --> 00:55:21.735
The whole thing
is a bit mind-boggling. everybody.

106
00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:23.820
It's just-- It's just fantastic.

107
00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.829
It's a pretty cool photo.
It's just gorgeous.
