00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:18.739
she barfs.

36
00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:20.574

-Traffic where?

66
00:05:57.858 --> 00:05:59.827

St. Agatha's are going to
change the decision.

79
00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.606
It's no longer an expulsion.
You're just suspended.

80
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:48.576
The amount of shit I had to eat
to accomplish that...

81
00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:51.111
-Tony. I literally
just got here. so...

82
00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.446
-My name's not Tony.

83
00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:55.616
It's Dad.

84
00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:00.754
Now. they sent you home
to set some kind of example.

85
00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:02.289
As long as your grades
stay solid--

86
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.357
- Yeah. it sounds good.
-Hey. can you give me a second?

87
00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.559
-No. it sounds good.

88
00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:07.761
If your grades
stay solid.

89
00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:10.030

<i>It has been...</i>

92
00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:35.789
40 years
since my last confession.

93
00:07:40.628 --> 00:07:42.930
I had a drinking problem.

94
00:07:43.063 --> 00:07:45.232
and that became...

95
00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:47.067
a drug problem.

96
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.404
And I ruined my life.

97
00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:55.475
I ruined the lives of my family.

98
00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:05.352
You see. Father.
my wife got sick.

99
00:08:09.757 --> 00:08:11.825
Sh-- she got really.
really sick. you know.

100
00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:13.326
and. uh...

101
00:08:18.098 --> 00:08:20.300
I used that as an excuse.

102
00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:25.873
I didn't have to address
what I was doing because.

103
00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:30.711
"Hey. my wife's got cancer.
so fuck you."

104
00:08:36.483 --> 00:08:38.552
Her being sick

105
00:08:38.686 --> 00:08:42.890
gave me a reason
to just disconnect...

106
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.505
There's a thing that's come up.

107
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.043
It's a job.
and it's coming to me

108
00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:06.513
off the back of
somebody else's... tragedy.

109
00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:08.348
But maybe work
will be good for me. you know?

110
00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:11.184
Give me a sense of purpose.

111
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:14.888
Make me stronger.

112
00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:19.526
Maybe make my daughter
proud of me.

117
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.408
You're going to do
a remake of the...

118
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:41.214
Is it. um...
is it for the priest?

119
00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:42.115
Yeah. it's for the priest.

-Well. you as a priest.
it's just...

124
00:09:52.993 --> 00:09:55.696
it's just interesting.
You know. the mind reels.

125
00:09:57.197 --> 00:09:58.398
What? Okay. whatever.

126
00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.733
I mean. it's not
like a big deal

127
00:09:59.867 --> 00:10:01.735
if you don't book it
anyways. right?

128
00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:03.871

It actually is a big deal for me

00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:35.622
Just whenever you're ready.

185
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:39.592
Uh...

186
00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:41.094
Hey. you ready?

187
00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:42.129
Whenever.

188
00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:46.900
"This darkness.

189
00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:50.070
"I've seen this darkness before.

190
00:12:50.203 --> 00:12:52.572
"I've crawled through it.

191
00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:55.008
"Miss Carlisle.
it is a darkness

192
00:12:55.075 --> 00:12:56.776
"that slips inside
like a thief

193
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.880
"and takes everything
we treasure.

194
00:13:00.013 --> 00:13:01.781
It knows. it. uh..."

195
00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:03.783
Shit. Fuck it.

196
00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:06.153
Yeah.
All right. Never mind.

197
00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.487
Let's take a break.

198
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.822
Get rid of the script.

199
00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.658
Right. Let's just talk.

200
00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:14.494
-
- Ah. fuck!

201
00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.463
Let's. uh...

202
00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:18.665
let's just chat.
Just talk for a little while.

203
00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.101
Huh. that's what
they say when you're blowing it.

204
00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:24.171
You think
you're blowing it?

205
00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:26.139
I don't know. man.
I'm a little rusty. you know?

206
00:13:26.273 --> 00:13:28.175
And I've been away from it
for a little while.

207
00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.176
- Mm-hm.
- You know?

208
00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.945
I had some personal issues.

209
00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:35.082
Yeah. a little bit
of a bad patch.

210
00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:37.284
Hm. Go on.

211
00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.253
Go on?

212
00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:41.421
Yeah. bad patch.

213
00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:44.457
Uh. you don't--
you don't watch the news?

214
00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:52.599
Go on. Like what?

215
00:13:57.404 --> 00:13:59.272
-Well. you know.
I climbed inside of a bottle

216
00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:02.042
for a couple of years.

217
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:05.212
And it took me just as long
to climb back out. you know?

218
00:14:06.413 --> 00:14:07.647
I mean. look.

219
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.016
You've been through it. right?

220
00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:11.952
I mean. it's been a rough
couple of years. I mean...

221
00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:13.120
your wife...

222
00:14:14.955 --> 00:14:18.091
She passed away
a couple years ago. huh?

223
00:14:18.158 --> 00:14:20.627
-Yeah. she did. man.
She passed away.

224
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.029
I can't imagine.

225
00:14:22.162 --> 00:14:23.997
And with a kid--
you have a kid. right?

226
00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:26.666
I do.
I have a daughter. Lee.

227
00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:28.301
She's 16.
- Tell me about her.

228
00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:29.802
Are you guys. uh.
how's she doing?

229
00:14:29.937 --> 00:14:32.239
I mean. she must be...
you guys getting along?

230
00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:36.476
-Yeah... yeah.

231
00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:40.347
-Hey! You were a fucking
altar boy. weren't you?

232
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.982
I was. I was.

233
00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:45.185
I did five years at St Aloysius
when I was a kid.

234
00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:49.522
Five years of no fucking
weekends. you know?

235
00:14:49.656 --> 00:14:51.324
What the fuck
was that like?

236
00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:53.693
-That was... everybody did it.
you know. It was...

237
00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:55.662
I mean. you know.
I read that article

238
00:14:55.795 --> 00:14:56.997
about what those priests
did to you.

239
00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.199
uh. you boys down there.

240
00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:03.703
You still devout?

241
00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:07.674
-No. I'm not.

242
00:15:07.807 --> 00:15:08.708
Okay.

243
00:15:11.378 --> 00:15:12.512
Let me ask you something. man.

244
00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:18.085
I gotta make some decisions.

245
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.457
You know.
maybe you can help me out.

246
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.394
What do you think?

247
00:15:27.527 --> 00:15:29.196
You think you're right for this?

248
00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:31.264
I don't turn up
for shit I'm not right for. man.

249
00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:36.569
That's... all I want to do is.
I just want to be good.

250
00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:41.408
And I think I can be...

251
00:15:49.216 --> 00:15:50.984
Look. I'm really sorry
for wasting your time.

252
00:15:53.086 --> 00:15:54.121
Hold up a second.
Anthony.

253
00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:56.456
Do you...?

254
00:15:56.589 --> 00:15:59.826
Do you. uh.
do you remember Mass?

255
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.261
You know the words?

256
00:16:01.394 --> 00:16:02.229
Mass?

257
00:16:02.362 --> 00:16:03.830
Yeah.

258
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.666
-Fuck. man. Last time
I heard that. I was a kid.

259
00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:07.834
Give it a shot.

260
00:16:11.104 --> 00:16:15.642
-Blessed are you.
Lord God of all creation.

261
00:16:15.775 --> 00:16:18.311
uh...

262
00:16:18.445 --> 00:16:20.280
for through Your goodness.

263
00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:24.351
we have received
the bread we offer you:

264
00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:29.922
fruit of the earth.
work of human hands.

265
00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:35.162
it will become for us
the bread of life.

266
00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:00.620
Whoo!

267
00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:01.554
["Blank Generation" performed by
Richard Hell and the Voidoids]

268
00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:02.955
Hey. Lee.

269
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.824
Lee. can we get an ice bucket?

270
00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:09.662
- Hi.
- Oh. my god!

271
00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:11.531
-So crazy.
-When was that?

272
00:17:11.664 --> 00:17:12.632
When was the last time
I saw you?

273
00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:14.534
-I'm the exec on your film.
-No!

274
00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:16.203
- Yes.
-Oh. Joe? Joe.

275
00:17:16.336 --> 00:17:17.637
Jen. she's the exec
of the movie.

276
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:18.971
-Wow.
- Joe.

277
00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:20.707
-This is-- this is cool.
-Your audition was great.

278
00:17:20.807 --> 00:17:21.708
Really.
- Thank you.

279
00:17:21.841 --> 00:17:23.510
-Yeah. yeah.
- Tony.

280
00:17:23.643 --> 00:17:25.044
Tony.
-Hey. Pete.

00:17:25.178 --> 00:17:26.379
-Hey. pal.
- How are you?

282
00:17:26.646 --> 00:17:28.448
-Good. man. I want you to
meet Father George Conor.

283
00:17:28.515 --> 00:17:30.483
-Hello. Anthony.
- Father Conor...

284
00:17:30.617 --> 00:17:34.053
is going to be our consultant
for all things...

285
00:17:34.187 --> 00:17:37.190
-Arcane and/or Catholic.
If that's not too redundant.

286
00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.195
-My eyes are up here.
- Oh. yes. Sorry.

287
00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:44.164
I'm just. I'm gonna be wearing
one of these soon. I just...

288
00:17:44.297 --> 00:17:46.899
-You mean. this is what you're
condemned to wear. I'm sorry.

289
00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:48.201
You get used to it.
-Yeah.

290
00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:49.969
- You look...
- I look beat up.

291
00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:51.771
Thank you very much
for helping us out.

292
00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.173
Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

293
00:17:53.373 --> 00:17:54.341
-I'm just gonna go and see
everybody. if that's okay.

294
00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:55.942
- Yes. of course.
-Okay. Thank you.

295
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:57.544
Thank you. Thank you.

296
00:17:57.677 --> 00:17:59.279
- Exciting?
- Yeah. Oh.

297
00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:00.347
Totally exciting.
-That was unfortunate.

298
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.714
Do you want a drink?

299
00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:03.015
It's fine. it's fine.
Drink?

300
00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:05.152
-Uh. yes. I think I will.
-What will you have. Father?

301
00:18:05.218 --> 00:18:06.586
-I-- just alcohol.

302
00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:08.455
To my beautiful
cast and crew.

303
00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.523
and ancillary party guests.

304
00:18:10.657 --> 00:18:12.192
um. to Georgetown.

305
00:18:12.325 --> 00:18:13.560
To Georgetown.

306
00:18:13.693 --> 00:18:15.595
-
- Whooh.

307
00:18:19.166 --> 00:18:22.635
I've never told anyone.
I never wanted to be an actor.

308
00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:27.640
Then I found a copy
in a bargain bin.

309
00:18:27.807 --> 00:18:31.043
<i>Double Shift</i> to <i>Dirty Double.</i>

310
00:18:31.278 --> 00:18:32.512
And you played your twin.

311
00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:35.615
and you dive in.
and have that fight...

312
00:18:36.082 --> 00:18:36.983
-On the top of the building.

313
00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:38.951
-That. that. that. th--

314
00:18:39.085 --> 00:18:40.953
-That was. I think
I was getting fucking loaded

315
00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:42.889
in my trailer
when I did that shit.

316
00:18:43.022 --> 00:18:43.923
-

317
00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:46.092
-Like that night. I slept...

318
00:18:46.226 --> 00:18:47.394
-You're not a hack.

319
00:18:48.728 --> 00:18:51.564
-This is a psychological drama

320
00:18:51.698 --> 00:18:56.002
wrapped in the skin
of a horror movie. okay?

321
00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:57.937
Because this guy.
this guy right here.

322
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.506
this guy's not horror.
- Thank you.

323
00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.574
You don't make a...
Hey. pal.

324
00:19:01.708 --> 00:19:03.243
You don't make a--
you don't make a horror movie

325
00:19:03.376 --> 00:19:05.011
with this guy. This guy...

326
00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:10.783
This guy... this guy was pure
testosterone-drunk Americana.

327
00:19:10.917 --> 00:19:13.486
-You know.
I knew the guy that died.

328
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.188
-No shit.

329
00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:17.357
I'm so sorry.
-Yeah. um... that's okay.

330
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.692
Thank you. Thank you.
-Were you close?

331
00:19:20.327 --> 00:19:21.328
-Not really.

332
00:19:24.297 --> 00:19:26.032
Excuse me.

333
00:19:26.466 --> 00:19:27.667
- It is not!
-

334
00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:32.305
-Um... I gotta go.

335
00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.209
Shit. um...

336
00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:37.610
I sort of just walked in.

337
00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:40.280
I didn't mean to
walk in on you. Um...

338
00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:42.615
-Can you please
just shut the door?

339
00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:43.683
Okay.

340
00:20:05.171 --> 00:20:07.307
-

341
00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:10.176
You want some?

342
00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:11.244
-Oh...

343
00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:13.980
Thanks.

344
00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:25.825
Uh...

345
00:20:27.327 --> 00:20:28.628
Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

346
00:20:28.695 --> 00:20:29.662
-Yeah.

347
00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.203
- You write this?

348
00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:39.071
-Yeah...

349
00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:42.342
Yeah. it's... it's stupid.

350
00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:43.843
-

351
00:20:45.044 --> 00:20:46.178
Whatever you say.

352
00:20:46.313 --> 00:20:47.680
Well. okay. wait.

353
00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.250
I know who you are.

354
00:20:51.384 --> 00:20:52.519
Not to be weird.
I don't know...

355
00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:55.822
Um. you're a really good singer.

356
00:20:55.888 --> 00:21:00.460
and I watch <i>Vampire Sorority</i> .

357
00:21:00.527 --> 00:21:02.194
-Oh. I love my fans.

358
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.796
-Well. okay. Relax.
-

359
00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.032
-
You were really good on it.

360
00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:10.770
-You coming to set?

361
00:21:10.903 --> 00:21:14.307
-Yeah. Tony's making me PA

362
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:17.043
because I got
kicked out of school.

363
00:21:17.176 --> 00:21:18.144
-For what?

364
00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.581
-Being too cool.

365
00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:28.321
-See you.

366
00:21:41.768 --> 00:21:44.003
-
-

367
00:21:55.548 --> 00:21:56.916
-Wow.

368
00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:58.084
-Yeah. right?

369
00:21:58.217 --> 00:22:00.119
Not too bad.

370
00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:01.087
Anthony.

371
00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.522
Hi.
-Hey.

372
00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:04.757
-Welcome. welcome. welcome.
We're gonna get you to wardrobe.

373
00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:06.659
Come with me.
Monica. first AD.

374
00:22:06.726 --> 00:22:08.027
-I remember.
- Well. just checking.

375
00:22:08.094 --> 00:22:09.429
Okay. Lee...

376
00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:10.697
Nice to have you on the team.

377
00:22:10.763 --> 00:22:11.931
Ready?
- Thanks. Yeah.

378
00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:13.332
-

379
00:22:13.466 --> 00:22:15.334
All right. I have Anthony
for the wardrobe.

380
00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:33.786
So what's with the sage?

381
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.856
-Have you forgotten what
kind of movie we're making?

382
00:22:36.923 --> 00:22:38.057
<i>All kinds of</i>
<i>messed-up shit happened</i>

383
00:22:38.425 --> 00:22:40.893
<i>when they were making</i>
<i>devil movies like</i> The Omen

384
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.430
<i>or</i> The Exorcist.
The Poltergeist.

385
00:22:43.596 --> 00:22:46.132
<i>As far as I'm concerned.</i>
<i>we can't be too careful.</i>

386
00:22:46.265 --> 00:22:48.401
And the guy your dad replaced...

387
00:22:48.535 --> 00:22:51.571
Yeah. I read about that.
I mean. he was depressed.

388
00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:53.740
It didn't have to do
with the movie. right?

389
00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:54.741
If you say so.

390
00:23:02.449 --> 00:23:03.716
Lee. look.

391
00:23:07.153 --> 00:23:08.655
Hey. baby doll.

392
00:23:08.788 --> 00:23:09.922
Take a look at this.
- Hey.

393
00:23:10.056 --> 00:23:11.257
If you really
want to freak out

394
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:12.592
one of your boyfriends.

395
00:23:12.792 --> 00:23:15.061
just put that in your bed
in the morning. right.

396
00:23:18.364 --> 00:23:20.166
All right.
Let's see her do her thing.

397
00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:22.268
Oh. boy. Let's have a look.

398
00:23:25.972 --> 00:23:27.607
Okay. Let's see her twist
all the way around. man.

399
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.608
Yep. will do.

400
00:23:32.545 --> 00:23:35.114
Possession. you know?
All the way around.

401
00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:36.215
-
- Jesus!

402
00:23:36.382 --> 00:23:37.850
- Whoa!
- What is that?

403
00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:39.752
Is it supposed to spark?
- No.

404
00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:43.690
- All the way around.
- Okay. alright.

405
00:23:55.568 --> 00:23:57.203
And the highlight
of the tour...

406
00:23:57.336 --> 00:23:58.471
The Cold Room.

407
00:24:08.681 --> 00:24:10.650
So what did you do
to get kicked out of school?

408
00:24:12.418 --> 00:24:13.553
-Protest.

409
00:24:17.256 --> 00:24:20.326
Dropped a can of red paint
on my principal's Mercedes

410
00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:22.428
from the school roof

411
00:24:22.562 --> 00:24:24.330
because he fired
my guidance counselor

412
00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:26.065
for marrying her girlfriend.

413
00:24:27.567 --> 00:24:31.738
-That's not a protest.
That's destruction of property.

414
00:24:31.871 --> 00:24:33.272
-Okay. Well. whatever.

415
00:24:44.651 --> 00:24:45.818
It's weird.

416
00:24:48.054 --> 00:24:49.488
-I told you.

417
00:24:54.561 --> 00:24:55.928
-

418
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:11.110
-

419
00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:18.384
Not too shabby.

420
00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:19.351
-

421
00:25:20.486 --> 00:25:21.888
Thank you.

422
00:25:23.422 --> 00:25:24.390
-How's it feel?

423
00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:27.794
-Oh. uh... unusual.

424
00:25:27.927 --> 00:25:29.328
-

425
00:25:29.461 --> 00:25:31.363
-It's not--
it's not a vision that--

426
00:25:31.497 --> 00:25:34.466
that I would have thought
I would see.

427
00:25:34.601 --> 00:25:36.068
-Well. you look great.

428
00:25:36.202 --> 00:25:38.537
-Ah. thanks.

429
00:25:40.172 --> 00:25:41.874
How did this all start for you?

430
00:25:43.342 --> 00:25:44.410
The priesthood?

431
00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:46.078
-Yeah.

432
00:25:46.212 --> 00:25:47.714
-Hmm. Um...

433
00:25:49.849 --> 00:25:51.550
did you have heroes.
growing up?

434
00:25:51.684 --> 00:25:53.252
-Sure.

435
00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:56.488
Sandy Koufax.
Joe Namath. Burt Reynolds.

436
00:25:56.623 --> 00:25:58.190
-Yeah. you too. huh?

437
00:25:58.324 --> 00:26:00.026
-

438
00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:03.996
-Well. my heroes. growing up.
were priests.

439
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.936
I'll-- I'll leave you to--
to prepare.

440
00:26:10.069 --> 00:26:11.170
-Thank you.

441
00:27:05.124 --> 00:27:07.927
-
-

442
00:27:22.274 --> 00:27:26.112
-Miss Carlisle.
I'm Father Arlington.

443
00:27:27.213 --> 00:27:28.647
And cut!

444
00:27:28.781 --> 00:27:30.482
- Cut.
- All right.

445
00:27:30.616 --> 00:27:32.351
Beautiful.

446
00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:33.920
Let's move on.

447
00:27:34.086 --> 00:27:35.154
<i>Okay. people.</i>
<i>We are moving on.</i>

448
00:27:35.321 --> 00:27:36.355
<i>Let's go.</i>

449
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:38.925
<i>All right. you guys have to</i>
<i>turn it around inside</i>

450
00:27:39.058 --> 00:27:40.192
<i>for the second scene?</i>

451
00:27:40.326 --> 00:27:41.761
Great. man.
It's fucking great.

452
00:27:52.138 --> 00:27:53.840
-
-

453
00:27:56.843 --> 00:27:58.978
-What the fuck.

454
00:27:59.111 --> 00:28:00.046
Oh. crap.

455
00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:01.447
-
-Oh.

456
00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:01.707
Tony?

457
00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:52.558
Okay. Here we go--

458
00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:54.260
-

459
00:29:54.393 --> 00:29:57.163
-Tony. Tony. Tony.
Hey. look. You're fine.

460
00:29:57.296 --> 00:29:58.764
- Oh. fuck.
-You're okay. all right?

461
00:29:58.898 --> 00:29:59.798
Yeah. you're all right.

462
00:29:59.966 --> 00:30:01.834
-You fucking
scared the shit on me.

463
00:30:03.369 --> 00:30:05.437
I was...

464
00:30:05.571 --> 00:30:07.339
-You were sleepwalking.

465
00:30:07.473 --> 00:30:09.575
-

466
00:30:09.708 --> 00:30:10.576
You scared me.

467
00:30:10.709 --> 00:30:11.944
Fuck. I'm sorry.

468
00:30:12.078 --> 00:30:14.780
-I'm just a bit stressed.
I think. baby.

469
00:30:14.914 --> 00:30:15.948
You know?

470
00:30:16.082 --> 00:30:17.249
-Yeah. you've got
a big day coming up.

471
00:30:17.383 --> 00:30:18.617
Mm.

472
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.652
I do.
- Yeah.

473
00:30:28.627 --> 00:30:30.629
Again. make-up your last looks.

474
00:30:30.762 --> 00:30:33.799
There we go.
We are... rolling down.

475
00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:37.203
On your marks.

476
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:40.172
Set...

477
00:30:42.641 --> 00:30:46.445
Set... and... action.

478
00:30:47.746 --> 00:30:48.881
-"It sees everything.

479
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.953
It sees the monster
in me. David."

480
00:30:55.487 --> 00:30:58.290
-"There is no monster in you.

481
00:30:58.424 --> 00:30:59.558
Do you know
how much you are loved

482
00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:04.630
by your peers.
your parish. by me?"

483
00:31:04.763 --> 00:31:05.797
-"It knows you. too."

484
00:31:09.435 --> 00:31:12.038
"It sees your sins and mine.

485
00:31:12.171 --> 00:31:13.906
and sighs with
my father's voice."

486
00:31:18.144 --> 00:31:19.411
"I left him to die."

487
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.049
- Cut.
- Cut.

488
00:31:23.182 --> 00:31:24.483
-Fuck. come on.

489
00:31:26.285 --> 00:31:28.387
Geez. I'm so sorry. man.

490
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.156
Hey. man. I-- I don't know.

491
00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:32.524
Uh... what's going on?

492
00:31:32.658 --> 00:31:35.861
Um. I don't quite understand.

493
00:31:35.995 --> 00:31:38.030
uh. what-- what in--
what I'm not giving you.

494
00:31:38.164 --> 00:31:39.398
Yeah. sure.

495
00:31:39.531 --> 00:31:40.532
What-- what do you
need from the line?

496
00:31:40.666 --> 00:31:42.101
Just l-- let me know.

497
00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:46.405
-I need. um. the meaning
of the line. okay?

498
00:31:46.538 --> 00:31:49.541
I'm after the core of the line.

499
00:31:50.842 --> 00:31:53.179
I need the truth.

500
00:31:53.312 --> 00:31:54.380
All right?

501
00:31:54.513 --> 00:31:56.515
I need you to stop
evading the truth.

502
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:59.418
That makes sense?

503
00:32:01.553 --> 00:32:03.789
-I'm not--
-It's in there.

504
00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:05.424
Okay?
- Okay.

505
00:32:07.326 --> 00:32:08.760
-Stop being over it.

506
00:32:16.335 --> 00:32:17.403
All right. let's do it again.

507
00:32:17.536 --> 00:32:18.870
All right. going again.

508
00:32:19.005 --> 00:32:20.739
All right. let's roll it.

509
00:32:22.341 --> 00:32:24.110
All right. everybody. reset.

510
00:32:24.243 --> 00:32:25.377
Rolling.

511
00:32:25.511 --> 00:32:26.545
A mark.

512
00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:28.147
Stay in it.

513
00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:30.882
Going again.

514
00:32:31.017 --> 00:32:32.084
-Action.

515
00:32:32.218 --> 00:32:33.219
"It knows you. too.

516
00:32:33.352 --> 00:32:34.886
It sees your sins--
- Cut.

517
00:32:35.021 --> 00:32:35.721
-And sighs with my father's--
- Cut.

518
00:32:35.854 --> 00:32:37.323
Cut.

519
00:32:40.759 --> 00:32:42.228
Um...

520
00:32:42.361 --> 00:32:44.230
Tony. Come here a sec.

521
00:32:44.363 --> 00:32:45.264
Okay. everybody.

522
00:32:45.464 --> 00:32:47.566
let's go ahead
and take ten. please.

523
00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:51.470
That means everybody.
Let's go. Now.

524
00:32:51.603 --> 00:32:53.005
Take a break.

525
00:32:53.139 --> 00:32:55.074
-I had a lot of pushback
when I cast you.

526
00:32:55.207 --> 00:32:56.808
You know that. right?

527
00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.812
You know. because nobody thought
you could be the hero again.

528
00:33:00.946 --> 00:33:02.581
not after
what they read about you.

529
00:33:02.714 --> 00:33:05.284
But you looked me in the eye

530
00:33:05.417 --> 00:33:07.486
and you told me
you could be good.

531
00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:09.988
And I fucking
believed you. man.

532
00:33:10.122 --> 00:33:11.023
Now we're all standing around

533
00:33:11.223 --> 00:33:12.291
with our fuckin' dicks
in our hands

534
00:33:12.391 --> 00:33:14.993
because you're too afraid
to do the heavy lifting.

535
00:33:15.127 --> 00:33:17.929
All right? To connect. Okay?

536
00:33:18.064 --> 00:33:23.102
To own the fact
that you are this guy. okay?

537
00:33:23.235 --> 00:33:29.007
You are being eaten alive
by guilt.

538
00:33:29.141 --> 00:33:34.380
You are the sack of shit
who left a kid

539
00:33:34.513 --> 00:33:38.717
and his cancer-ridden wife
to shit on her own bed

540
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.386
while you went out.
and you fucking drank.

541
00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:42.954
and you blew rails.
and you chased pussy

542
00:33:43.089 --> 00:33:45.224
and Christ knows what else.

543
00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:49.328
Tony. you are irredeemable.

544
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:52.231
You hear me?

545
00:33:52.364 --> 00:33:54.533
Hey.

546
00:33:54.666 --> 00:33:55.734
You hear me?

547
00:33:57.636 --> 00:33:59.037
-Yeah.
- Yeah.

548
00:34:02.108 --> 00:34:04.876
You're him. Let's do it.

549
00:34:15.187 --> 00:34:17.223
-
-What the fuck!

550
00:34:17.356 --> 00:34:20.759
Jesus fucking Christ.
Monica!

551
00:34:22.494 --> 00:34:23.995
What the fuck. man?!

552
00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:26.098
Yo! You won't let them
hang the goddamn light!

553
00:34:26.232 --> 00:34:27.766
Hey. don't fucking
tell me that.

554
00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.335
This thing almost
fucking killed me.

555
00:34:29.468 --> 00:34:30.536
You need to take care of it.

556
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:32.938
Take care of it.
Shut the fuck up!

557
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:36.608
Fuck you. Peter!
I need an electrician. Now!

558
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.618
-
-

559
00:37:05.357 --> 00:37:06.425
Hey.

560
00:37:06.558 --> 00:37:07.526
-Hey...

561
00:37:11.297 --> 00:37:14.065
Sorry. I just came for
your laundry hamper and...

562
00:37:19.905 --> 00:37:21.840
I don't like
that you heard that today.

563
00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:26.011
- Heard what?

564
00:37:33.885 --> 00:37:35.454
-

565
00:37:57.609 --> 00:38:00.312
St. Michael. Saint. uh...

566
00:38:00.446 --> 00:38:01.813
- Gabriel.
- ...Gabriel.

567
00:38:01.947 --> 00:38:02.981
St. Raphael.

568
00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:04.716
Yeah.

569
00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:08.987
All-- oh my God!
All holy angels and archangels.

570
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.091
all holy...
I mean. it just sounds so...

571
00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:14.893
-What. archaic?

572
00:38:15.026 --> 00:38:18.263
Patriarchal? Outdated?

573
00:38:18.397 --> 00:38:19.765
-No. it just sounds silly.

574
00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:23.234
That's why it's so hard to learn
because it just sounds silly.

575
00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:26.071
-Do you remember when
I would do plays in school

576
00:38:26.204 --> 00:38:27.606
and I couldn't remember
the lines

577
00:38:27.739 --> 00:38:29.575
and you always told me it's--
it's because I didn't know

578
00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:30.642
what the line's actually about?
-Yeah. you gotta know

579
00:38:30.776 --> 00:38:32.411
what the line's about.
-Right.

580
00:38:32.544 --> 00:38:33.945
What's the line actually about?

581
00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:37.916
-It's an exorcism.

582
00:38:39.985 --> 00:38:43.455
So he has to believe
in these words

583
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:48.026
with the whole of his being.
Yeah?

584
00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.461
Yeah.

585
00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:55.333
Okay. exactly. You got it.

586
00:38:55.467 --> 00:38:59.037
-St. Michael.
St. Gabrielle. St. Raphael.

587
00:39:07.245 --> 00:39:08.647
-Hey. are you okay?

588
00:39:10.482 --> 00:39:11.483
-Yeah.

589
00:39:11.617 --> 00:39:12.784
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

590
00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:17.523
-Tony. are you sure?
-I can do it. Yeah.

591
00:39:17.656 --> 00:39:18.557
You go to bed.

592
00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:21.226
-Okay.

593
00:39:24.129 --> 00:39:25.230
-Hey.

594
00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:40.879
-Get some rest. okay?

595
00:39:55.494 --> 00:40:00.732
"All holy patriarchs
and prophets. pray for us.

596
00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:07.405
St. Bartholomew.
St. Thomas. St. William.

597
00:40:07.539 --> 00:40:12.077
Intercede for us.
St. Bartholomew."

598
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.131
Tony?

599
00:41:05.631 --> 00:41:06.898
-
-Fuck.

600
00:41:20.746 --> 00:41:22.313
Tony?

601
00:41:36.595 --> 00:41:38.196
Tony?

602
00:42:19.938 --> 00:42:20.839
-
-

603
00:42:20.972 --> 00:42:22.540
-
- Oh!

604
00:42:45.196 --> 00:42:47.232
Yeah. you are taking
the new meds. right?

605
00:42:50.802 --> 00:42:52.938
Okay. just make sure you call
your doctor in the morning.

606
00:43:03.849 --> 00:43:04.783
"Don't say that.

607
00:43:05.016 --> 00:43:07.686
You're the only one
who can help me."

608
00:43:07.753 --> 00:43:11.389
<i>-"I understand your concern</i>
<i>for your daughter</i>

609
00:43:11.556 --> 00:43:13.558
<i>but I am not the man</i>
<i>for the job."</i>

610
00:43:13.692 --> 00:43:15.126
"Then who is?"

611
00:43:17.562 --> 00:43:21.232
"I understand
your concern for your daughter."

612
00:43:21.366 --> 00:43:22.600
Jesus.

613
00:43:22.734 --> 00:43:24.202
"But I am not
the man for the job."

614
00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:25.536
"Then who is?"

615
00:43:25.671 --> 00:43:27.706
What the fuck
is wrong with this guy?

616
00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:30.075
Here we go.

617
00:43:30.208 --> 00:43:31.309
Oh Christ.
he looks like hell.

618
00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:32.711
"I understand your concern."

619
00:43:32.844 --> 00:43:34.880
I could apply more concealer.

620
00:43:35.013 --> 00:43:35.914
With what? A spatula?

621
00:43:36.047 --> 00:43:36.948
"Then who is?"

622
00:43:40.085 --> 00:43:41.119
All right.
just kill the sound.

623
00:43:41.252 --> 00:43:42.253
I can't watch
any more of this shit.

624
00:43:42.387 --> 00:43:43.454
I need a drink.

625
00:43:44.956 --> 00:43:46.391
This guy's a fucking drunk.

626
00:43:55.133 --> 00:43:56.001
Sorry.

627
00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:12.350
-I don't imagine it's easy
being the child of a movie star.

628
00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:15.186
- Yeah.

629
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.654
Movie star part's not bad.

630
00:44:16.788 --> 00:44:21.126
It's the addict part that's...
messy.

631
00:44:21.259 --> 00:44:22.828
-Hm.

632
00:44:22.961 --> 00:44:24.262
You've been through a lot...

633
00:44:30.736 --> 00:44:35.006
We can't always save people.
but we can forgive them.

634
00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.008
So I'm told.

635
00:44:37.142 --> 00:44:39.010
-What? So now
you're a shrink too?

636
00:44:39.144 --> 00:44:40.779
-What a terrible thing
to say to anyone!

637
00:44:40.912 --> 00:44:41.947
-

638
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.215
-Yes. actually. I am a shrink.
-

639
00:44:44.282 --> 00:44:46.718
-I got my degree in clinical
psychology from Columbia.

640
00:44:46.852 --> 00:44:48.153
-

641
00:44:48.286 --> 00:44:50.722
-My mission here
is to ease people's paranoia.

642
00:44:50.856 --> 00:44:52.824
and not stoke it.

643
00:44:52.958 --> 00:44:55.660
-So you don't believe any of it?

644
00:44:57.095 --> 00:44:58.463
-Not 99 percent of it.

645
00:44:58.596 --> 00:45:00.331
-Oh yeah. exactly.

646
00:45:04.469 --> 00:45:06.872
What about you?

647
00:45:07.005 --> 00:45:09.207
You believe this stuff?
-

648
00:45:16.982 --> 00:45:18.850
I don't know
what I believe anymore.

649
00:46:03.528 --> 00:46:05.030
What was your mom like?

650
00:46:05.163 --> 00:46:07.765
She was. um.
like a sister.

651
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.737
Like messy.
but in like a fun way.

652
00:46:12.871 --> 00:46:14.405
-
-Um...

653
00:46:17.242 --> 00:46:20.778
Nothing's felt like normal

654
00:46:20.912 --> 00:46:24.816
since she's not
in this world anymore.

655
00:46:32.723 --> 00:46:35.260
Sometimes I wish
that he had died instead of her.

656
00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:38.663
Am I a horrible person?

657
00:46:40.265 --> 00:46:41.266
-No.

658
00:46:48.073 --> 00:46:50.508
Do you wanna--
do you want to come inside?

659
00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:52.677
Okay.

660
00:46:54.412 --> 00:46:55.280
- Okay?
-Okay.

661
00:46:55.413 --> 00:46:56.481
- Okay.
-Yeah.

662
00:46:56.614 --> 00:46:57.949
Okay.

663
00:47:05.924 --> 00:47:07.658
-

664
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:25.877
Fuck!
What the fuck?

665
00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:28.947
Tony. what...?

666
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.148
What are you--
what are you doing in here?

667
00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:31.616
Why were you in the dark?

668
00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:39.157
-I don't know.
- Well. look at your hand.

669
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:40.225
Why are you bleeding?

670
00:47:40.458 --> 00:47:42.060
How long have you
been like this for?

671
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:46.297
You're fucking
covered in blood.

672
00:47:46.431 --> 00:47:48.566
And you smell
like a distillery.

673
00:47:54.039 --> 00:47:55.206
What's wrong with you?

674
00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:02.180
What? So you're
blacking out again?

675
00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:06.584
That's great.

676
00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:08.253
What-- what is it this time?
Is it coke?

677
00:48:08.386 --> 00:48:09.921
-No. no. no.
- Or something worse?

678
00:48:10.055 --> 00:48:12.157
-I'm not on anything.
I'm not taking anything.

679
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:13.591
It's something else. I just...

680
00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:16.594
Well. if you took
your medication. you know.

681
00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:19.197
you probably
wouldn't feel that way.

682
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:21.666
-

683
00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:29.274
-No. This...
I can't.

684
00:48:29.407 --> 00:48:30.608
I can't.
-Everything I ever did wrong.

685
00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:31.842
I still see!

686
00:48:33.544 --> 00:48:34.545
Everything.

687
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.882
I don't sleep.

688
00:48:38.016 --> 00:48:39.284
I can't.

689
00:48:41.019 --> 00:48:42.887
Because that's when I see her.

690
00:48:44.255 --> 00:48:47.292
-Fuck. Look. okay.
if you want to use

691
00:48:47.425 --> 00:48:49.860
and if you want to
fuck it all up again.

692
00:48:49.995 --> 00:48:53.398
then that's fine.
but I'm out. okay?

693
00:48:53.531 --> 00:48:56.467
So. unless you get
your shit together

694
00:48:56.601 --> 00:49:01.272
and you take your fucking meds.
then I'm not staying. okay?!

695
00:49:05.543 --> 00:49:07.245
-Where are you gonna go?

696
00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:16.954
You don't have a school.

697
00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:22.160
You don't have a mother.

698
00:49:24.395 --> 00:49:28.299
All you have is me.

699
00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:33.238
-Sleep it off. asshole.

700
00:49:33.371 --> 00:49:34.572
-Is that any way
to talk to your dad?

701
00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:36.141
- Get out.

702
00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:38.943
Get out.
Get the fuck out!

703
00:49:39.077 --> 00:49:40.945
Get out. Tony! Get out!

704
00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:46.251
-My name is not Tony.

705
00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:26.891
These are for you.

706
00:50:27.024 --> 00:50:29.860
-

707
00:50:35.466 --> 00:50:36.901
That looks really bad.

708
00:50:39.337 --> 00:50:40.205
-It's fine.

709
00:50:43.007 --> 00:50:44.475
Let me help.

710
00:51:04.462 --> 00:51:05.330
Let me see it.

711
00:51:05.463 --> 00:51:06.897
-

712
00:51:13.838 --> 00:51:15.440
-Tony. you need to see a doctor.

713
00:51:20.345 --> 00:51:22.713
-It's okay. kiddo.

714
00:51:22.847 --> 00:51:23.881
It's just... whoo...

715
00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:27.685
It's just taking...

716
00:51:27.818 --> 00:51:29.187
It's taking it out of me.

717
00:51:34.392 --> 00:51:35.893
I don't even know
what happened the other night.

718
00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:37.061
What happened. the other night?

719
00:51:42.533 --> 00:51:45.303
It's not your job
to caretake for me.

720
00:51:46.671 --> 00:51:48.206
So just. bunny. make it easy.

721
00:51:48.339 --> 00:51:51.075
Just please go back to school.

722
00:51:51.209 --> 00:51:52.109
Okay?

723
00:51:53.744 --> 00:51:54.712
I'm your dad.

724
00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:56.647
I'm telling you
how it's gonna go.

725
00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:09.160
Because I need you
to be safe. okay?

726
00:52:13.231 --> 00:52:14.131
Okay?

727
00:52:18.436 --> 00:52:19.770
I'm sorry
I'm not better than this.

728
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:35.286
Hey.

729
00:53:02.447 --> 00:53:03.448
He's off his meds.

730
00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:08.619
And he's erratic.
And he-- he's--

731
00:53:08.753 --> 00:53:10.288
he's sleepwalking
when he's awake.

732
00:53:10.421 --> 00:53:12.022
if that even makes any sense.

733
00:53:12.156 --> 00:53:14.392
Yes. it-- it--
it makes a kind of sense.

734
00:53:14.525 --> 00:53:16.494
Uh. I wonder...

735
00:53:16.627 --> 00:53:17.828
I wonder if
what you're describing

736
00:53:17.962 --> 00:53:21.466
points to some kind of stuff...

737
00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:25.670
that he's not dealt with

738
00:53:25.803 --> 00:53:28.906
and maybe the movie
is dredging something up.

739
00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:31.509
-When you say stuff. do you--
what. like trauma?

740
00:53:31.642 --> 00:53:32.710
-Uh...

741
00:53:33.878 --> 00:53:34.979
Maybe.

742
00:53:37.648 --> 00:53:39.517
-My mom always said.
I don't know.

743
00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:42.387
some messed up stuff

744
00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.921
happened to him
when he was a kid.

745
00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:47.692
But I mean. Tony has never
spoken to me about any of that.

746
00:53:47.825 --> 00:53:49.026
So I...

747
00:53:53.298 --> 00:53:55.533
Father. what do I do?

748
00:53:55.666 --> 00:53:59.236
-Well. you're his daughter.
not a shrink.

749
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:00.938
I'll talk to him.

750
00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:03.541
If you want to help...

751
00:54:03.674 --> 00:54:05.042
pray.

752
00:54:08.513 --> 00:54:13.351
-He was praying
that night in the lobby.

753
00:54:13.484 --> 00:54:14.752
Or...

754
00:54:16.721 --> 00:54:18.022
muttering.

755
00:54:18.155 --> 00:54:19.724
He doesn't pray. ever.

756
00:54:21.926 --> 00:54:24.261
-Well. what was he saying?

757
00:54:24.395 --> 00:54:27.097
[Anthony muttering in Latin
through phone recording]

758
00:54:35.873 --> 00:54:39.243
-Why is he speaking Latin?

759
00:54:39.377 --> 00:54:40.978
What would you--
do you know what he's saying?

760
00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:43.981
-Uh-- uh-- eh...

761
00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:46.551
It's-- it's-- it's broken.
but...

762
00:54:46.684 --> 00:54:49.219
along the lines of. um.

763
00:54:49.354 --> 00:54:51.722
"Make way for the demon Molech.

764
00:54:51.856 --> 00:54:53.991
prepare for his arrival.

765
00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:56.794
sacrifice your children."

766
00:54:56.927 --> 00:55:00.565
Molech is the demon
from the movie he's making.

767
00:55:00.698 --> 00:55:04.134
Look. in my opinion.

768
00:55:04.268 --> 00:55:06.504
this role is affecting him
too deeply.

769
00:55:06.637 --> 00:55:08.105
He's. I think--
maybe he's-- he's been too.

770
00:55:08.238 --> 00:55:11.108
too. too method about it.

771
00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:13.678
Let me talk to him.

772
00:55:16.414 --> 00:55:19.417
Girls. if I had a nickel
for every lookie-loo

773
00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:21.151
who showed up at the parish
over the years

774
00:55:21.285 --> 00:55:23.354
telling me they suddenly
could speak Latin

775
00:55:23.488 --> 00:55:25.656
and make a bed float.

776
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:27.124
I'd be on a beach somewhere.

777
00:55:28.826 --> 00:55:31.662
I know whereof I speak.
So trust me. All right?

778
00:56:28.653 --> 00:56:29.520
You...

779
00:57:14.732 --> 00:57:15.533
-
- All right.

780
00:57:15.666 --> 00:57:17.301
All right. let's film.

781
00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:18.368
Rolling.

782
00:57:21.872 --> 00:57:22.907
Quiet.

783
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.241
Action.

784
00:57:24.374 --> 00:57:25.275
-"Lord have mercy."

785
00:57:25.409 --> 00:57:26.243
"Fuck you. priest!"

786
00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:28.913
-"Christ have mercy.

787
00:57:29.046 --> 00:57:30.247
The Holy Spirit..."

788
00:57:31.616 --> 00:57:32.483
"Fuck you!"

789
00:57:32.617 --> 00:57:33.751
-"...have mercy on us."

790
00:57:33.884 --> 00:57:35.586
-
- Goddamit.

791
00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:36.954
Cut. Cut. just...

792
00:57:37.087 --> 00:57:38.088
Cut!

793
00:57:38.355 --> 00:57:39.289
- Back to one.
-

794
00:57:39.423 --> 00:57:40.825
- Here we go.
- One more time.

795
00:57:40.891 --> 00:57:42.092
-Are you okay?
-No. I don't feel so good.

796
00:57:42.226 --> 00:57:43.928
Rolling.

797
00:57:44.061 --> 00:57:46.430
- No?
What's wrong?

798
00:57:46.564 --> 00:57:50.467
Come on. guys. Set.

799
00:57:50.601 --> 00:57:52.102
- Now play.
- That's smart.

800
00:57:52.236 --> 00:57:53.904
I'm fine. I'm fine.

801
00:57:54.038 --> 00:57:55.105
- You good?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

802
00:57:56.473 --> 00:57:58.242
Right away.
Come on. you got it.

803
00:57:58.375 --> 00:58:00.978
You got it!

804
00:58:01.111 --> 00:58:03.080
Camera's up.

805
00:58:03.213 --> 00:58:04.915
Action.

806
00:58:05.049 --> 00:58:07.618
"Lord have mercy.

All right.

00:58:09.954 --> 00:58:11.321
Back to one.
-Come on.

810
00:58:11.455 --> 00:58:12.957
All right.
going again.

811
00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:14.024
Rolling. Rolling.

812
00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:15.125

- Action! Action!

813
00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:18.128
- "Fuck you!"
-

814
00:58:18.262 --> 00:58:21.198
"Cocksucker.
Fuck you.

815
00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:22.633
You can't do anything."

816
00:58:24.969 --> 00:58:26.637
- Cut. cut. cut. cut.
- Cut.

817
00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:28.305
That's a cut.
- Jesus Christ!

818
00:58:28.438 --> 00:58:29.339
It's okay. it's okay.

819
00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:33.711
-Just say the words.

820
00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:36.280
Just say the fucking words.
-I'm trying to.

821
00:58:36.413 --> 00:58:38.315
-Show me that that priest
fucked a little sense into you

822
00:58:38.448 --> 00:58:40.017
back when you were 12 years old.

823
00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:47.024
Back to one!

824
00:58:47.257 --> 00:58:48.492
- Here we go.

00:58:48.593 --> 00:58:49.694
We gotta reset. Back to one.

828
00:58:53.798 --> 00:58:54.699
Action!

829
01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:45.976
Help...

830
01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.011
-Tony?

831
01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:51.315
Not exactly.

832
01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:46.804
We have to recast.
There's no choice.

833
01:01:48.672 --> 01:01:51.976
They want the best movie
they can possibly have.

834
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:53.510
-How is he?

835
01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:54.644
-How is...? He's...
- Yeah.

836
01:01:54.779 --> 01:01:57.147
-I... he's not great.

837
01:01:58.648 --> 01:02:00.184
He can't do the movie.

838
01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:04.889
-

839
01:02:05.022 --> 01:02:06.924
I don't know what
you want me to say. man.

840
01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:09.659
-I want you to say. "Okay."

841
01:02:09.794 --> 01:02:13.831
Joe. you got the chops.

842
01:02:13.964 --> 01:02:15.232
Pal...

843
01:02:17.634 --> 01:02:19.569
you can do this.

844
01:02:19.703 --> 01:02:22.039
You'll be saving
the fucking movie.

845
01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:29.246
-Okay.

846
01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:34.684
- Okay. All right.
All right.

847
01:02:40.024 --> 01:02:41.391
"Christ have mercy...

In heaven. God the Father...

01:02:49.834 --> 01:02:51.535
God the Father.

852
01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.140
Lord have mercy.

853
01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:57.707
Christ have mercy..."

854
01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:06.416
"Lord have mercy.

855
01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:08.452
Christ have mercy."

856
01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:09.553
Yeah. Yeah.

857
01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:45.956
"Charlie.

858
01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:47.691
there's no monster in you.

859
01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:53.130
It knows you too.

860
01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:55.699
I left him to die.

861
01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:57.534
Yes.

862
01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.203
Yes. I did..."

863
01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:00.971
-

864
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:15.953
-"All gone. even our senses."

865
01:04:23.127 --> 01:04:27.064
"So that we enter
this final passage

866
01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:28.132
naked in our human--"

867
01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:13.377
-Hey...

868
01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:27.724
Okay.

869
01:05:31.195 --> 01:05:32.529
Open up.

870
01:05:40.504 --> 01:05:42.206
And one more.

-

872
01:06:11.535 --> 01:06:12.436
-What is it?

873
01:06:13.537 --> 01:06:14.838
-

874
01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.673
They shut the movie down.

875
01:06:18.775 --> 01:06:20.177
-What?

876
01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:23.013
-It's Joe.

877
01:06:23.147 --> 01:06:24.281
What did he say?

878
01:06:27.051 --> 01:06:29.753
-They found him...

879
01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:31.421
in pieces.

880
01:06:31.555 --> 01:06:33.957
-What?
-Joe is dead.

-It's okay.

-

886
01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:02.952
I don't want to leave you.
-I'm fine.

-Tony?

891
01:07:57.141 --> 01:07:59.543
Go get help!

892
01:08:03.247 --> 01:08:04.248
Tony.

893
01:08:04.381 --> 01:08:06.883
Hey. what's wrong?
Hey. are you okay?

894
01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:09.186
-

895
01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:17.627
She's never gonna
eat your pussy like I will.

896

-
- Ah!

897
01:08:22.232 --> 01:08:23.400
-Kiss her.

- Come on! Come on!
- Go. go. go!

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:30.407
Go. go. go. go!
