(upbeat music)

6
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.900
- What's up guys. Joey Bufalino here.

7
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.990
Now. I have been hinting
at some very big news

8
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.260
for quite some time.

9
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.833
And today is the day.

10
00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:39.640
Whoa. look at that!

11
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.730
Come on!

12
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.240
Now Claire and I have been
together for about a year.

13
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.080
So I reckon it's time to take
things to the next level.

14
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.010
And of course. I wanted you
all to be the first to know.

15
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.020
Now this. sorry. (laughs)

16
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.970
this is where I'll be
popping the big question.

17
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.530
Look at that.

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.730
Oh. did a bit of recon last weekend.

19
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.392
the most epic location
for the most epic couple.

20
00:01:05.392 --> 00:01:07.975
(upbeat music)

21
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.160
- Well. the new interface
is launching in three days.

22
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.760
I really need all hands on deck.

23
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.960
Oh no. we're just gonna
be out for the day.

24
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.610
So I can do that when I get back.

25
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.000
(laughs) I haven't been hiking in ages.

26
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.719
Joey's really been looking forward to it.

27
00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:33.690
- Gonna take her up to the mountains

28
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.550
near where she grew up

29
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.520
for the most epic view. an epic surprise.

30
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.080
Now I can't live stream
this for obvious reasons.

31
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.600
which is why you are
watching it all cut together.

32
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.388
So sit back. relax and enjoy

33
00:01:47.388 --> 00:01:50.550
the most awesome proposal video

34
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.777
you have ever seen. Buffman out.

35
00:01:55.617 --> 00:01:57.667
- Great. Keep me posted on those numbers.

36
00:01:59.054 --> 00:02:00.023
(laughs) I'm fine.

37
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.960
I know. I know.

38
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.903
I've been working a lot. but I love it.

39
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.680
Okay. Kelly. Jason's call me.

40
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.570
It's probably about that wellness package.

41
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.403
Okay. bye.

42
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.403
Hi. Jason.

43
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.003
What's the?

44
00:02:20.236 --> 00:02:22.819
(gentle music)

45
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.763
Yeah. no. I'm. I'm here.

46
00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.060
(upbeat music)

47
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.660
Oh. okay.

48
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.976
Well. why don't you just
send it over in a PDF

49
00:02:31.976 --> 00:02:32.940
(car horn honking)

50
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.180
and I'll take a look at it.

51
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.013
Yes.

52
00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.032
Yeah. right?

53
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.163
Well. did you check
with the marketing team?

54
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.943
Okay.

55
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.920
Ah. sorry.
(Joey whistling)

56
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.723
Could you repeat that
one more time for me?

57
00:02:50.723 --> 00:02:51.960
- What I tell ya?

58
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.530
Most amazing girl ever.

59
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.018
Her company is absolutely
killing it right now.

60
00:02:55.018 --> 00:02:56.023
- Yeah. the PDF's way better then JPEG.

61
00:02:56.023 --> 00:02:56.856
- Good thing.

62
00:02:56.856 --> 00:02:59.308
She'll have a relaxing day up
in the mountains today. huh?

63
00:02:59.308 --> 00:03:00.141
- Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:00.141 --> 00:03:01.364
Well. it's all about the color scheme.

65
00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:02.210
you want it all to match. to blend.

66
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.263
- That was way too much.
Let's try that again.

67
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.110
- Sure. Okay. if you send it over-

68
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.013
- Oh. look who we have here.

69
00:03:09.013 --> 00:03:11.578
- That's great. thank you.
- The big boss. herself.

70
00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:16.578
(both chattering)
(gentle music)

71
00:03:20.687 --> 00:03:21.520
- [Claire] It's all about-

72
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.530
- [Joey] We're only 20. 30 minutes out.

73
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.110
- So I was thinking-
- Oh. it's a beautiful day.

74
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.943
Wish you could see-
- Perfect.

75
00:03:25.943 --> 00:03:27.240
- The beauty in front of me.
- Great. thank you.

76
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.280
- But the hike won't be too bad.

77
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.180
And then we'll be at the
top for that epic view

78
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.227
that I promise it's gonna be great.

79
00:03:33.227 --> 00:03:35.520
And you're gonna be with
us every step of the way.

80
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.353
So we'll see you there.

81
00:03:36.353 --> 00:03:38.360
Buffman out.
- Hey Kelly. how are ya?

82
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.990
Good. we were just talking
about the color schemes.

83
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.240
I'm thinking gray and blue are
gonna be most complimentary

84
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.073
for the cover page.

85
00:03:45.073 --> 00:03:46.993
- Okay. so.

86
00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:57.444
- Well. that's not really
gonna matter next week.

87
00:03:57.444 --> 00:03:59.740
I can check into that
when I get back tonight.

88
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.871
- [Joey] Oh. and so. it actually begins.

89
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:03.641
- I like option three best.
but could you run that by Abby.

90
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:04.791
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

91
00:04:04.791 --> 00:04:07.734
- Look at that. Come on. (laughing)

92
00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:09.655
Oh my goodness.

93
00:04:09.655 --> 00:04:10.963
- (laughs) I know. can you imagine?

94
00:04:10.963 --> 00:04:11.840
(phone beeping)

95
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.673
Oh. you know what?

96
00:04:12.673 --> 00:04:13.506
Jason's calling.

97
00:04:13.506 --> 00:04:14.339
Can I call you right back?

98
00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:16.290
- This is gonna be so great.
- Hi. Jason.

99
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.870
I did. I was just talking to her.

100
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.402
So we decided-
- Yes.

101
00:04:20.402 --> 00:04:23.569
(gentle upbeat music)

102
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.865
- No. it's not a problem.

103
00:04:27.865 --> 00:04:30.475
I'll be gone a couple hours at most.

104
00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:32.044
Don't worry.

105
00:04:32.044 --> 00:04:33.894
Well. it's a complicated process.

106
00:04:33.894 --> 00:04:35.340
- We're actually going
through a gorgeous field

107
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.144
of wildflowers right now.
- Don't worry.

108
00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:37.977
- I don't know if you can see this

109
00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:40.794
but. literally. all around me.
- Hello?

110
00:04:40.794 --> 00:04:42.010
- Have a look at that.
- Jason. are you there?

111
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.000
- Hello. man. how gorgeous is that?

112
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.760
- Hey. is there gonna be a
service up where we're going?

113
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.460
- Oh. you don't sure. Claire bear.

114
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:51.193
Just keep going this way.

115
00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:53.626
All up there.

116
00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:57.547
Wildflowers. like I said. all around.

117
00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.714
(gentle upbeat music)

118
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:07.070
(birds chirping)

119
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.267
- [Claire] Buff. this is great.

120
00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:09.967
I'm so glad you talked me into it.

121
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.400
- Well. I am just glad
that you could take time

122
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.093
out of your successful career
to come adventuring with me.

123
00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:23.308
(Claire huffs)

124
00:05:23.308 --> 00:05:24.213
- Classic.

125
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.233
- To the most beautiful.
hardworking girl I know.

126
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.830
Congrats on having one of
the most downloaded apps

127
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.820
in the country last month.

128
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.133
- It's a start. (laughs)

129
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.200
- Would you actually mind if
I got a quick time-lapse video

130
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.563
of us just kind of eating and
enjoying this awesome view.

131
00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:59.704
- Of course I don't mind.

132
00:06:03.468 --> 00:06:06.135
(Claire laughs)

133
00:06:08.973 --> 00:06:11.556
(upbeat music)

134
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.670
- This is just what I needed.

135
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.563
Thank you.

136
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.463
Well. I am ready to go.
Been off work way too long.

137
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.800
- Oh. actually we sorta need
to wait till. till sunset.

138
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.860
I have a bit of a surprise for
you. but it'll be worth it.

139
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.360
I promise.

140
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.233
- Is sunset really necessary.

141
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.513
- Oh yeah.

142
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.660
- Okay. How about we compromise?

143
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.980
I will wait 15 minutes.

144
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.280
Then you do your surprise.

145
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.333
- Um. well. the sun won't
be setting in 15 minutes.

146
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.790
- But I promise you.

147
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.520
you're gonna get the exact
same reaction out of me

148
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.330
whether the sun is
setting or almost setting.

149
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.560
How about you just show
me the surprise now?

150
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.790
- Actually. um. could
you just. so quickly.

151
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.163
just take a couple of photos of me.

152
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.480
Just need some content
from today. you know.

153
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.980
for the followers.
- Yeah.

154
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.950
- They are gonna want
to see this for sure.

155
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.140
Trust me.

156
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.250
- Okay. fine.

157
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.700
A couple photos. then you do your surprise

158
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.550
and then we leave.

159
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.037
I don't want to get caught in the dark.

160
00:07:48.037 --> 00:07:51.120
- Oh. well. no worries because

161
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.513
brought torches.

162
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.370
Right.

163
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.340
Okay. Yes.

164
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.210
Two photos. one. one from this direction

165
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.040
and then one from this
direction. then the surprise.

166
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.010
And then we leave.

167
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.640
Yeah?
- Okay.

168
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.593
Two photos.

169
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.520
Oh. (laughs) Babe. always horizontal.

170
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.703
Come on. we. we've talked about this.

171
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:23.723
Wait. yeah.

172
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.010
(camera clicking)

173
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.350
Let's take a loo.
actually the. the lighting

174
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.707
and the angle had just a bit off.

175
00:08:35.707 --> 00:08:37.170
Could you maybe actually stand up

176
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:39.583
and just like a foot back.

177
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.624
Sorry. just. yeah.

178
00:08:43.624 --> 00:08:46.374
I just wanna get the whole
composition. you know.

179
00:08:46.374 --> 00:08:47.960
- Uh-huh.
- The. the sky and me.

180
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.720
of course. and the mountains.
- Yep.

181
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.036
Yep. I'm getting it.
- Okay.

182
00:08:52.036 --> 00:08:54.433
(camera clicking)

183
00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:56.030
- Okay.

184
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.173
Oh great.

185
00:08:58.065 --> 00:09:02.370
Except we just. we accidentally
chopped my feet off there.

186
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.203
Try it once.

187
00:09:03.203 --> 00:09:04.925
Yeah. sorry. one more time.

188
00:09:04.925 --> 00:09:06.700
(Claire laughing)

189
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.460
Sorry. mate. maybe just crouch down a bit.

190
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.960
I'm just. I'm trying to
get the whole composition

191
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.793
that we mentioned. you know?

192
00:09:12.793 --> 00:09:16.720
So don't be afraid to back
up a bit if you have to.

193
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.347
- [Claire] Is this far enough?

194
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.350
- Yeah. probably.

195
00:09:25.284 --> 00:09:27.564
(suspenseful music)

196
00:09:27.564 --> 00:09:28.397
Claire?

197
00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:31.211
(dramatic music)

198
00:09:31.211 --> 00:09:32.044
Claire?

199
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.401
(Claire yelling)

200
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:42.451
Claire!

201
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:43.916
(dramatic music)

202
00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:46.583
(Joey grunting)

203
00:09:54.186 --> 00:09:57.430
(phone beeping)

204
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:02.430
Oh. no. come on signal!

205
00:10:05.482 --> 00:10:07.065
No. no. no. no. no.

206
00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.527
Claire. I'm coming!

207
00:10:15.504 --> 00:10:18.087
(Joey yelping)

208
00:10:22.975 --> 00:10:25.558
(Joey moaning)

209
00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:32.496
(camera clicking)

210
00:10:34.316 --> 00:10:37.891
(chipmunk chirping)

211
00:10:37.891 --> 00:10:41.567
(camera clicking)
(Joey screaming)

212
00:10:41.567 --> 00:10:43.970
(Joey yelling)

213
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.593
- Oh my! Base. this is
Nat. this is. nevermind.

214
00:10:50.118 --> 00:10:52.262
(Joey screaming)

215
00:10:52.262 --> 00:10:57.056
- [Joey] Tree! Oh! (coughing)

216
00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:58.732
- Oh. oh. safety first. safety first.

217
00:10:58.732 --> 00:11:02.296
(Joey moaning)
(dramatic music)

218
00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:03.531
(phone beeping)

219
00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:04.614
- Oh. Claire.

220
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.207
(phone beeping)

221
00:11:16.099 --> 00:11:17.290
(Natalie gasping)

222
00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.480
Oh! My girlfriend fell in the river.

223
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.730
- Sh. don't move. It's okay.

224
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.630
My name is Natalie. I'm
with the forest service.

225
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.973
You're in safe hands now.

226
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.290
Base. this is Natalie Pritchard.

227
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.347
I'd like to report an accident.

228
00:11:33.347 --> 00:11:35.995
(radio beeping)

229
00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:36.828
(helicopter whirring)

230
00:11:36.828 --> 00:11:38.560
- [Dispatcher] Female slipped
and fell into the river.

231
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.370
We'll update you with more
information when it arrives.

232
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.390
- [Pilot] Copy. Heading
in that direction now.

233
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.140
Ground volunteers are on their way.

234
00:11:49.987 --> 00:11:54.987
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

235
00:12:00.047 --> 00:12:01.721
(dramatic music)
(Joey gasping)

236
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:02.554
(Joey moaning)

237
00:12:02.554 --> 00:12:04.119
- Whoa now. Hold on. hold on.

238
00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:04.952
Hold on.

239
00:12:04.952 --> 00:12:05.785
You were hurt pretty badly

240
00:12:05.785 --> 00:12:07.300
when you came somersaulting
down that mountain side.

241
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.700
I'm no doctor. but I'd say

242
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.040
you have a badly bruised rib cage.

243
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.520
I'm gonna need you to stay right here

244
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.590
until more help arrives.

245
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.310
- No. no. no. My girlfriend
fell off a cliff.

246
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.730
I can't just stay here.

247
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:17.970
Right? I need to go find her.

248
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:18.860
- It's okay. It's okay.

249
00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.840
I already called it in.

250
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.870
Search and rescue out there
right now looking for her.

251
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.820
Can you tell me her name along
with a physical description?

252
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.690
- Yeah. it's Claire McAllister

253
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:33.170
and well. she's absolutely gorgeous.

254
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.430
- Yeah you are.
- Hm?

255
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.060
- I mean she is. I mean. I'm sure she is

256
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.240
because like I can imagine.
because that makes sense since.

257
00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.770
do you recall her. her hair
color. eye color. height.

258
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.030
If you. if you need a moment
to gather your thoughts.

259
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.610
that's totally fine.

260
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.380
Base. this is Natalie Pritchard.

261
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.490
- [Dispatcher] Go for base.

262
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.080
- I'm here with our
tumble victim who's awake

263
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.980
and I think coherent enough to supply us

264
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.400
with a description of our missing person

265
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.623
whose name is Claire McAllister.

266
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.320
- [Dispatcher] Copy. We're ready.

267
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.180
- Oh. she has a golden blonde hair

268
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.880
and well. I forget how tall she is.

269
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.900
but she's smaller than me.

270
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.460
That's for sure.

271
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.190
She has ocean blue eyes

272
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.920
and. and she was wearing a red jacket

273
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.060
and. and black workout pants

274
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.823
that were very. very. very flattering.

275
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.800
(radio beeping)

276
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.000
- [Dispatcher] Natalie.
are you still there?

277
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:35.683
- Still here?

278
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:37.643
Her age.

279
00:13:37.643 --> 00:13:38.960
- Oh. ah. ah.

280
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.960
She's 28 years old and well.
also. she's really beautiful.

281
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:49.700
I mean like model level. beautiful.

282
00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.260
Maybe not super model because
of the height thing. you know.

283
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.943
but. but definitely Insta worthy.

284
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.530
- Base. did you copy all of that?

285
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.441
You're looking for a
blonde-haired. blue-eyed beauty.

286
00:14:04.441 --> 00:14:05.691
- [Dispatcher] Copy that.

287
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.980
- [Pilot] What's the latest
on our missing hikers?

288
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.830
- [Dispatcher] Our missing person

289
00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:14.610
is female. blonde. small
build. blue eyes. late 20s.

290
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.540
last seen wearing a red
jacket and black pants.

291
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.410
Her name is Claire McAllister

292
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:23.095
and there's stormy weather rolling in.

293
00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:25.420
So let's find this woman
within the next few hours.

294
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.253
All right?

295
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.270
- All right. I'll keep looking.

296
00:14:30.794 --> 00:14:32.794
(gentle upbeat music)

297
00:14:32.794 --> 00:14:37.794
(hooves thudding)
(horse whickering)

298
00:14:49.325 --> 00:14:52.892
(water whooshing)

299
00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:55.392
(owl hooting)

300
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.503
- Buff?

301
00:15:08.623 --> 00:15:09.456
Buff?

302
00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:13.077
Anyone?

303
00:15:15.862 --> 00:15:16.695
Buff!

304
00:15:19.532 --> 00:15:22.532
(crickets chirping)

305
00:15:24.014 --> 00:15:26.764
(dramatic music)

306
00:15:37.787 --> 00:15:42.787
(brush rustling)
(suspenseful music)

307
00:15:55.726 --> 00:15:58.476
(dramatic music)

308
00:16:13.722 --> 00:16:17.152
(coyotes howling)

309
00:16:17.152 --> 00:16:20.152
(crickets chirping)

310
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.890
- [Natalie] So. I'm sorry.
but what was your full name?

311
00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:27.433
- Joey. Joey Bufalino.

312
00:16:28.503 --> 00:16:29.336
- (laughs) Oh.

313
00:16:29.336 --> 00:16:30.560
- Sorry. what was it?

314
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.393
- Oh. nothing.

315
00:16:31.393 --> 00:16:32.670
It's just your name's Joey

316
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.140
and you're Australian and you're cute.

317
00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.160
It's cute.

318
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.625
That Joey is a baby kangaroo.

319
00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:39.213
- (laughs) Oh. yeah.

320
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.607
- Mr. Bufilino I strongly encourage you

321
00:16:44.607 --> 00:16:46.510
not to go looking for
your girlfriend alone.

322
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.720
- Okay. first of all.
my mates call me Buff.

323
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.220
I'm pretty sure we're
past the formalities now.

324
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.013
And second of all. I'm
not alone. I'm with you.

325
00:16:56.664 --> 00:16:58.333
- Nat. That's cool.

326
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.500
Just to be perfectly clear.

327
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.980
I'm not gonna follow you
into the starry night

328
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.070
as dreamy as that sounds. alone. together.

329
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:10.660
with the moon shining down.
shut a rubber ball snake!

330
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.740
- Where. where?
- Right there!

331
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.573
Oh. you missed it.

332
00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:14.700
It slithered underneath the rock.

333
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.610
Did you know that they're
one of two boa constrictors

334
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:17.730
in the United States.

335
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.220
That's pretty cool. right?

336
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.320
- Oh yeah? What's a. what's the other one?

337
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.847
- Rosie boa.

338
00:17:22.847 --> 00:17:24.380
- Oh.
- Yeah.

339
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.320
Joey. look.

340
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.400
- Please. Buff.

341
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.410
- Buff.

342
00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.660
We have amazing volunteers
and your eyes are so green

343
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.430
and they almost always
find the missing person

344
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.000
within the first 24 hours.

345
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.740
I hate to say it. but if
you head out on your own

346
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.010
and in the dark. you're just
gonna get lost yourself.

347
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:39.843
Then search and rescue.

348
00:17:39.843 --> 00:17:41.010
they're gonna have to
come and find you too.

349
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.160
which means less people
looking for Claire.

350
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.833
Fine. fine.

351
00:17:49.701 --> 00:17:51.660
I'll help you keep looking
for her until it's too dark.

352
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.440
And then we're setting up a camp.

353
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.460
- I brought torches and
I brought an extra tent

354
00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.040
and sleeping bag that you can borrow.

355
00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:57.873
I can almost guarantee

356
00:17:57.873 --> 00:17:59.600
that you're gonna wake up
the next morning with news

357
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.580
that Claire has been found

358
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.420
and all she needs is a couple Band-Aids.

359
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.770
maybe a cast or two.
- Hm?

360
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.670
Okay. fine. we'll camp out tonight.

361
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.167
But tomorrow morning. if
she hasn't been found.

362
00:18:13.167 --> 00:18:15.660
I'm gonna keep looking for her myself.

363
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.650
- Fair enough.

364
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.817
(gentle upbeat music)

365
00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:32.003
(coyote howling)

366
00:18:32.003 --> 00:18:37.003
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

367
00:18:42.438 --> 00:18:45.090
(Claire snoring)

368
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.632
- Whoa!

369
00:18:46.632 --> 00:18:49.404
(birds chirping)

370
00:18:49.404 --> 00:18:51.402
(horse whickering)

371
00:18:51.402 --> 00:18:54.600
(hooves thudding)

372
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.433
Hello?

373
00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.383
- [Colt] Hello.

374
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.160
You all right?

375
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.750
- Yes. I am fine.

376
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.163
You have no idea how
excited I am to see another.

377
00:19:11.603 --> 00:19:13.440
- Hi. Claire.

378
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.640
- Nope.

379
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.390
Nope. nope. nope. nope.

380
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.880
- [Colt] What are you doing?

381
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.553
- I'm waiting for someone
else to come rescue me.

382
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.963
- (scoffs) You haven't changed.

383
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.690
- What?

384
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.240
- I said. you haven't changed.

385
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.580
You looked like you've been through hell.

386
00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.930
And when you don't like the
hand that's here to help you.

387
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.985
you'd rather spend a few
extra hours up in a tree.

388
00:19:35.985 --> 00:19:39.053
(laughing) You are so stubborn.

389
00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.783
- Okay. fine. Make the call.

390
00:19:44.062 --> 00:19:46.812
(birds chirping)

391
00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.950
- It's Colt McCoy.

392
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:52.560
I found Claire McAllister.

393
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.773
She seems to be safe and well.

394
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.370
Possible minor injuries
but she's not in shock.

395
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.530
- I'm not sure how accurate that is.

396
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.340
I spent the night in a tree.

397
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.710
- [Dispatcher] Great work. Colt.

398
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.260
Give us your location and
we can send in a chopper.

399
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.330
Colt. do you copy?

400
00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.150
- I copy. Standby for location.

401
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.710
Need to get the higher
ground for a reference point.

402
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.020
- [Dispatcher] Copy that.

403
00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.330
- You don't know where we are.

404
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.600
- Oh. I know where we are.

405
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.170
but you need to stop acting like a child.

406
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.860
Claire. and come down from there.

407
00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.040
I'm not doing this all over again.

408
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.000
- What?

409
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.110
- You're lucky to be alive.

410
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.890
You were washed miles down that river.

411
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:33.270
It's a miracle you didn't drown.

412
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.490
- Don't change the subject.

413
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.810
You get back on your little radio

414
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.760
and you tell them exactly where we are.

415
00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:40.780
- No.

416
00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.780
- Excuse me?

417
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.743
- I said. no.

418
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.330
You need to come down
from that tree. Claire.

419
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.940
and start treating me like an adult.

420
00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.090
then I'll call in the chopper

421
00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.566
and then someone else can deal with ya.

422
00:20:50.566 --> 00:20:53.052
(birds chirping)

423
00:20:53.052 --> 00:20:56.350
(laughing) Okay?

424
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.183
Fine.

425
00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.370
- What are you doing?

426
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.500
- Coming up there to help you down.

427
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.460
- [Claire] Uh-uh. I don't.
I don't need your help.

428
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.777
- Claire. get out of that tree.

429
00:21:04.777 --> 00:21:05.647
- No!
- Claire!

430
00:21:05.647 --> 00:21:06.480
- No!
- Claire.

431
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.610
- No!
- Get down!

432
00:21:08.949 --> 00:21:11.150
(Colt huffing)

433
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.834
- [Claire] What are you doing?

434
00:21:12.834 --> 00:21:14.277
- I'm getting you out of this tree.

435
00:21:14.277 --> 00:21:16.580
- No. no. no. Get out of the tree.

436
00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.515
Get out of-

437
00:21:17.515 --> 00:21:21.122
(Colt grunting)
(Claire gasping)

438
00:21:21.122 --> 00:21:24.306
Colt! Are you all right?
(horse neighing)

439
00:21:24.306 --> 00:21:27.718
(Colt moaning)

440
00:21:27.718 --> 00:21:29.052
You all right?

441
00:21:29.052 --> 00:21:30.130
- Yeah. Yeah.

442
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.620
I'm fine.

443
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.453
I'm fine.

444
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:39.073
I just broke my radio.
(radio whining)

445
00:21:39.073 --> 00:21:42.260
(groans) And maybe my back.

446
00:21:45.224 --> 00:21:47.424
- (sighs) Well. don't
you have a cell phone?

447
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.593
- Yeah. I do.

448
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.910
But there's no cell service for miles.

449
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.193
We're gonna have to get the higher ground.

450
00:21:58.178 --> 00:22:01.193
(thunder rumbling)
(horse neighing)

451
00:22:01.193 --> 00:22:03.980
No. no. no. no! Come back!

452
00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.193
(hooves thudding)

453
00:22:05.193 --> 00:22:08.177
Bella! (groans)

454
00:22:08.177 --> 00:22:09.633
- Aren't you going after her?

455
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.660
- She's long gone and
on her way back home.

456
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.460
She'd rather be there than out here.

457
00:22:16.971 --> 00:22:18.021
(laughs) Smart horse.

458
00:22:18.965 --> 00:22:21.643
- This is the most vivid
nightmare I have ever had.

459
00:22:22.693 --> 00:22:24.520
- (laughs) You're telling me.

460
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.290
You know. I knew it.

461
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.910
I knew I should have
turned around the second

462
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.730
I heard your name over
the radio. but no. no.

463
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.400
I thought. you know. we're
two grown adults by now.

464
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.600
What could be the issue?

465
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.410
You sure proved me wrong. Claire.

466
00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.540
Again.

467
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.840
- What about smoke signal?

468
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:43.900
- It's fire season. okay.

469
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.490
We can't build a fire big
enough to send up enough smoke.

470
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.540
So we can only do that

471
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.843
if we have absolutely no other choice.

472
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.560
- And do we?

473
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.200
- Yes. we're gonna get to high ground.

474
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.500
Call the rest of the team.

475
00:22:59.018 --> 00:23:02.660
- (sighs) Okay. You can do that.

476
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.550
I'm gonna follow the river

477
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.500
and I'm sure it'll spit me out
somewhere near civilization.

478
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:08.843
- Claire.

479
00:23:11.058 --> 00:23:11.891
- What?

480
00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:12.724
- Look.

481
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:19.560
Here is where we are more or less.

482
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.883
Here is where civilization is.

483
00:23:23.074 --> 00:23:25.132
Now. right here is where
I think we can get-

484
00:23:25.132 --> 00:23:26.493
- (laughs) You think?

485
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.920
- Here is where I'm pretty confident

486
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.080
we can get cell service.

487
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.892
So unless you want to spend
a few extra hours on foot.

488
00:23:36.892 --> 00:23:38.393
this is your only option.

489
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.790
- Okay. great.

490
00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.103
Let's go get cell service.

491
00:23:45.266 --> 00:23:47.066
- (throat clearing) Claire?
- What?

492
00:23:48.949 --> 00:23:49.830
(throat clearing)

493
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.714
(birds chirping)

494
00:23:51.714 --> 00:23:54.964
(gentle upbeat music)

495
00:24:17.636 --> 00:24:18.469
(thunder rumbling)

496
00:24:18.469 --> 00:24:20.537
- It's about a 7:00 a.m.

497
00:24:20.537 --> 00:24:22.070
I didn't sleep very well last night.

498
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.800
Still pretty banged up
from the fall I took.

499
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.213
But. you guys. my Claire-bear
took it even worse fall.

500
00:24:27.213 --> 00:24:31.023
And I've no idea where
she is or how she's doing.

501
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.790
I mean. search and rescue
are out there right now.

502
00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.010
looking for her which is so good.

503
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.773
But. I don't know. honestly. you guys.

504
00:24:38.773 --> 00:24:40.760
I can't just sit around
here and do nothing.

505
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.458
You know. I've got to
get back on the trail.

506
00:24:42.458 --> 00:24:43.291
(Natalie yelling)
(Joey yelping)

507
00:24:43.291 --> 00:24:44.976
- [Natalie] Sorry.

508
00:24:44.976 --> 00:24:46.540
Oh. I'm sorry.

509
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.910
I didn't mean to actually scare you.

510
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.117
I was just checking to see if you were up

511
00:24:49.117 --> 00:24:50.837
and you are and that's great.

512
00:24:50.837 --> 00:24:54.226
- (laughing) No. it's it's no worries.

513
00:24:54.226 --> 00:24:56.173
(laughs) I was just playing around.

514
00:24:59.395 --> 00:25:01.630
(Joey gasping)

515
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.310
Is there any news about?

516
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.410
- Yes. Yes.

517
00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:06.860
One of the search and rescue volunteers

518
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.100
on horseback found her.

519
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.453
- They did! Oh. where is she?

520
00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.710
- Well. that's the other thing.

521
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.810
We haven't heard back from
him since his initial call.

522
00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:17.680
- Who. him?

523
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.740
- Oh yeah. Colt.

524
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.020
He's great. Very capable.

525
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.380
Real outdoorsy type.

526
00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.486
Claire is an excellent hands.

527
00:25:24.486 --> 00:25:28.370
- Hey. a colt is a baby horse. Nat. so.

528
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:29.800
- You don't have anything to worry about.

529
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.023
Colt is a good person.

530
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.660
I mean. it is a little alarming

531
00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.990
that we haven't heard back
since. but I'm sure they're fine.

532
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.823
He's awesome.

533
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.360
- Did he get her an awesome
ring? No. I don't think so.

534
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.193
- I'm sorry. What?

535
00:25:42.193 --> 00:25:43.026
- Oh. nothing.

536
00:25:43.026 --> 00:25:45.240
Are you sure he didn't
say where they were?

537
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.643
- Yes. I'm sure.

538
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.240
- Right. I've got to
go find her. (moaning)

539
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.160
- Let me get you some painkillers.

540
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.986
Oh. you know what you need?

541
00:25:55.986 --> 00:25:57.230
- Yeah. a cold beer and a general breeze.

542
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.990
- Hot springs. There's a
couple. not too far from here.

543
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.770
They're so good for aching muscles.

544
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.700
And the minerals present
in the water get soaked up

545
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.210
in the skin and help with circulation.

546
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:06.270
- Yeah. I don't think so.

547
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.970
See. I don't want to waste any more time

548
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.630
because every second that goes by

549
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.570
Claire could be inching
that much closer to death.

550
00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:13.870
- I think we can rule out death.

551
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:16.110
Colt did say that she was safe and well.

552
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.970
I mean. it's your choice if
you want to get up and go.

553
00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.210
but the hot springs could really help.

554
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.087
- So you're saying that I can't rescue her

555
00:26:22.087 --> 00:26:23.833
if I can. you know. barely stand.

556
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.483
- Is that what you want me to be saying?

557
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:31.840
- You're stubborn. I don't
like it. but I respect it.

558
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.890
Very well. we'll do it your way.

559
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.630
Can you show me where
these hot springs are?

560
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:39.759
- Oh. definitely. (giggles)

561
00:26:39.759 --> 00:26:41.648
(Joey moaning)

562
00:26:41.648 --> 00:26:44.565
(thunder rumbling)

563
00:26:58.846 --> 00:27:00.677
- You sure you don't want one of these?

564
00:27:00.677 --> 00:27:01.510
- I'm fine.

565
00:27:04.266 --> 00:27:07.183
(stomach gurgling)

566
00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.441
Thanks.

567
00:27:14.441 --> 00:27:16.870
(birds chirping)

568
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.740
Hey. um. this is kind of embarrassing.

569
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.193
but it is Saturday. right?

570
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.480
- Yep. It's Saturday.

571
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.313
- Good.

572
00:27:27.313 --> 00:27:28.630
'Cause I have some really
important work stuff Monday

573
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:29.930
that I have to be back for

574
00:27:30.893 --> 00:27:34.263
and it will be nice to have
a day to. well. shower.

575
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.353
- Yeah. So what do you do for work now?

576
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:44.120
- Oh. I run a wellness
app called Second Nature.

577
00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.680
It's all about creating
positive. simple habits

578
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.090
that help improve everyday life.

579
00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.920
I had to hire another 10
people just this week.

580
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.593
- Hm. well. I hope it makes you happy.

581
00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.563
- It does. It makes me very happy.

582
00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.110
And I have a boyfriend who is so great

583
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.260
about letting me do my own thing.

584
00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.713
And he travels all the
time. which is awesome.

585
00:28:08.656 --> 00:28:11.410
(Colt laughs)

586
00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:13.856
Well. I mean. I go with him. sometimes.

587
00:28:13.856 --> 00:28:14.689
- Oh.

588
00:28:14.689 --> 00:28:18.170
- We travel to beautiful places together

589
00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:19.841
and eat delicious food.

590
00:28:19.841 --> 00:28:22.758
(thunder rumbling)

591
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.749
Hey. you got any more snacks?

592
00:28:30.749 --> 00:28:31.582
Ooh. Hey!

593
00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:36.186
(birds chirping)

594
00:28:36.186 --> 00:28:39.103
(thunder rumbling)

595
00:28:40.232 --> 00:28:43.065
(water whooshing)

596
00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:51.263
You're gonna climb that?

597
00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.603
- Yes. I am gonna climb that.

598
00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.260
- Have you done this before?

599
00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.500
- I'll be fine.

600
00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.970
- [Claire] In the rain?

601
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:00.880
- It's not raining.

602
00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.333
- Well. it's about to be.

603
00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:04.993
Don't you need a rope?

604
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.903
- Well. a rope would be
great. but I don't have one.

605
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.800
- Well. what if you fall?

606
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.823
- I won't fall.

607
00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.243
If I do just turn your head
so you don't see me land.

608
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.820
Look. the sooner I make it up there.

609
00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.050
the sooner I can make the call.

610
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.130
the sooner I make the call.
the sooner we can part ways.

611
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.670
Now. you wanna go home

612
00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:27.023
or do you want to continue
telling me how this can go wrong?

613
00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:31.923
Thank you.

614
00:29:34.407 --> 00:29:37.074
(Colt grunting)

615
00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:41.450
(Colt groaning)

616
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:42.560
(Claire gasping)

617
00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.170
Sorry. you might want to take a step back.

618
00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:48.453
- Great. I'm gonna be
responsible for your death.

619
00:29:50.061 --> 00:29:55.061
(water whooshing)
(birds chirping)

620
00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.910
Are you high enough for cell service?

621
00:30:02.417 --> 00:30:03.590
(phone beeping)

622
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:04.677
- No. not yet.

623
00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.760
- So you still work at that ranch?

624
00:30:19.873 --> 00:30:21.123
- I own it now.

625
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.073
- Wow. That's surprising.

626
00:30:28.404 --> 00:30:30.720
- Why is that surprising?

627
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.610
- Well. all those years ago
you seemed perfectly content

628
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.700
to stay right where you were.

629
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.020
I mean. it's not like you
actually went anywhere.

630
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.500
but still. I'm impressed
you had the ambition

631
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.363
to take charge.

632
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.874
- All right. Little Miss
Too Good For. (groaning)

633
00:30:48.874 --> 00:30:51.624
(dramatic music)

634
00:30:56.045 --> 00:31:00.260
(Colt sighing)
(somber music)

635
00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:04.730
- Maybe it still works. Nope. it's dead.

636
00:31:05.766 --> 00:31:08.349
(Colt sighing)

637
00:31:14.694 --> 00:31:17.277
(gentle music)

638
00:31:20.313 --> 00:31:21.286
(Colt groaning)

639
00:31:21.286 --> 00:31:24.119
(water splashing)

640
00:31:25.206 --> 00:31:27.823
(Claire giggling)

641
00:31:27.823 --> 00:31:28.850
(Colt panting)

642
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:30.361
Sorry.

643
00:31:30.361 --> 00:31:32.861
(Colt scoffs)

644
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:39.432
You know. Colt. I really
was trying to catch.

645
00:31:39.432 --> 00:31:42.015
(gentle music)

646
00:31:47.123 --> 00:31:49.014
What you doing?

647
00:31:49.014 --> 00:31:50.532
- Washin' off.

648
00:31:50.532 --> 00:31:53.199
(gentle music)

649
00:32:13.206 --> 00:32:14.520
(water trickling)

650
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.230
- Oh and another cool
fact about hot springs.

651
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:18.870
They're naturally detoxifying.

652
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:19.870
- Oh.
- Yeah.

653
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:21.960
They can be a gentle
remedy for skin ailments.

654
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.720
such as acne. eczema. psoriasis.

655
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.740
(laughs) I mean. not that
you have any skin issues.

656
00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.473
your skin is flawless.

657
00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:33.280
Anyway. in addition to the
mineral content present

658
00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.780
in the water. the heat of the hot springs.

659
00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.830
they can alleviate the sensation of pain.

660
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.883
- You know so much stuff. Nat.

661
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.728
I mean. you are like the
smartest person I've ever met.

662
00:32:44.728 --> 00:32:48.580
- (laughs) Oh. I mean.
I don't know about that.

663
00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.231
I mean. I did get a 4.0 in college.

664
00:32:50.231 --> 00:32:55.231
- Nat. bit of a problem.

665
00:32:56.951 --> 00:32:59.980
- No. I'm sorry. Joey.

666
00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.820
- Oh. it's fine.

667
00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.490
- No. I completely wasted your time.

668
00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:04.810
I promise I had no idea.

669
00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.580
They must have put this up last night.

670
00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:07.413
They should have radioed me.

671
00:33:07.413 --> 00:33:08.780
- Nat. it's fine.

672
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.150
It's all good.

673
00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.210
I'm actually feeling a lot better.

674
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.640
The painkillers you gave
me worked like a charm.

675
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.220
Okay?

676
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.370
And besides the last
hot springs I went to?

677
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:21.023
Filled with naked old men.

678
00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.073
I mean. not that there's anything
wrong with that. you know.

679
00:33:24.073 --> 00:33:28.840
I just. um. (laughs) I'm just
still recovering a little bit.

680
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.580
So this is good. This is great.

681
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.550
We'll get back on track faster
so I can find my Claire-bear.

682
00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.650
I mean. I've got an epic
proposal to make. you know.

683
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:38.650
and I have a feeling. Nat.

684
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:42.073
that I can spin this
in just the right way.

685
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:48.140
Imagine. I find Claire
somewhere out there.

686
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:49.003
- With Colt.

687
00:33:49.003 --> 00:33:52.893
- And I'll wrap her in a
plaid blanket. something cute.

688
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:56.453
And then I kiss her passionately.

689
00:33:58.203 --> 00:34:01.360
and then. and then I get down on one knee.

690
00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:07.593
Then I say. I know this whole
thing has been so unexpected.

691
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.767
but I have one more surprise for you.

692
00:34:13.396 --> 00:34:14.737
And this one I planned.

693
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:17.983
Will you marry me?

694
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.293
- I will.

695
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:22.622
What?

696
00:34:22.622 --> 00:34:23.455
- Help you! (laughs)

697
00:34:23.455 --> 00:34:25.910
I mean. I will. I will help
you find your girlfriend

698
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:30.290
so you can get down on one
knee and ask her to marry you.

699
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:31.910
- Amazing. Amazing!

700
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:34.504
Oh. I so appreciate
everything you've done. Nat.

701
00:34:34.504 --> 00:34:35.637
- And I like hearing that.

702
00:34:35.637 --> 00:34:38.020
(thunder rumbling)

703
00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.560
Oh. on second thought?

704
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.610
We may need to take shelter
until the storm passes.

705
00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:44.860
- Oh. come on. Mother Nature!

706
00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.540
Whose side are you on?

707
00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.365
Ooh. hey. look at that cloud formation.

708
00:34:49.365 --> 00:34:50.198
- [Nat] Oh. yeah!

709
00:34:50.198 --> 00:34:52.580
- I've got to get a quick pic of that.

710
00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.910
- Oh. if you just lower. yep. mm-hmm.

711
00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:56.956
You'll get the tail-end of a
super cool looking dark cloud.

712
00:34:56.956 --> 00:34:59.342
- Oh. good spot. Nat.

713
00:34:59.342 --> 00:35:00.798
- Thanks.

714
00:35:00.798 --> 00:35:01.973
(camera clicking)

715
00:35:01.973 --> 00:35:02.806
(thunder rumbling)

716
00:35:02.806 --> 00:35:04.100
- Oh.

717
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.373
- Well. blown away.

718
00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.255
- Now we just have to count to see.

719
00:35:08.255 --> 00:35:09.088
(thunder cracking)

720
00:35:09.088 --> 00:35:10.210
Oh. oh. that's very close.

721
00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:12.151
We should go find shelter.

722
00:35:12.151 --> 00:35:12.984
- Yep.

723
00:35:15.812 --> 00:35:18.729
(thunder rumbling)

724
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:42.883
Rain. Rain. I hear rain.

725
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.753
- Shelter!

726
00:35:47.092 --> 00:35:52.092
(rain drumming)
(thunder rumbling)

727
00:36:00.054 --> 00:36:05.054
(birds chirping)
(rain drumming)

728
00:36:09.838 --> 00:36:11.750
- I don't need that.

729
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:12.583
- Yes. you do.

730
00:36:12.583 --> 00:36:13.483
- No. I don't.

731
00:36:24.156 --> 00:36:26.473
I can't believe I left my
jacket in that stupid tree.

732
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:32.920
- Claire. you're obviously freezing.

733
00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.883
Okay. let's get your body temperature up.

734
00:36:38.295 --> 00:36:40.045
Here. let's see that.

735
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.627
- How'd you find me?

736
00:36:57.567 --> 00:36:59.743
- Ah. I'm not really sure.

737
00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:02.883
- Meaning?

738
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.760
- Well. you're not gonna believe me.

739
00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.593
- Try me.

740
00:37:09.106 --> 00:37:12.153
- Well. I kind of fell
asleep on the horse.

741
00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.853
You know. I zoned out so
much. I don't really remember.

742
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:21.320
It was just starting
to get a little light.

743
00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.080
I was coming on my way through the trees

744
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.830
down by the river and told
myself I'd just close my eyes

745
00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:28.120
for a couple of seconds.

746
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.490
Next thing I know. I hear you calling out.

747
00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:32.483
my eyes snap open and it's morning.

748
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:36.930
Somehow I'm still on Bella's
back. gripping the reins.

749
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.970
See you up in that tree.
looking like a drowned cat.

750
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.460
- Mm. sounds made up.

751
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.623
- Yeah. well. told ya.

752
00:37:44.503 --> 00:37:47.813
- So what you're saying is Bella found me.

753
00:37:48.702 --> 00:37:50.990
- Yep. you owe your gratitude to a horse.

754
00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.983
- I'll be sure to thank her
if we ever make it back.

755
00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.510
- When we make it back.

756
00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:01.093
(gentle music)

757
00:38:02.155 --> 00:38:03.604
(throat clearing)

758
00:38:03.604 --> 00:38:07.200
All right. well. since we have
no way of contacting anyone.

759
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.440
the best bet is to follow the river down

760
00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.430
to the ranger stations.
another day's journey.

761
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.173
From there we can radio the rescue team-

762
00:38:14.173 --> 00:38:15.593
- I'm sorry. A day?

763
00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:18.680
- Yeah.

764
00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.210
- I can't do that.

765
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.823
I have people depending on me.

766
00:38:22.806 --> 00:38:23.940
- It's our best option. Claire.

767
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:24.773
- Really?

768
00:38:24.773 --> 00:38:27.100
Because I think our best
option is a smoke signal.

769
00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.160
- I told you that is last result.

770
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.110
- I feel like we've reached that point.

771
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:34.400
- Fire season gets worse
and last longer. every year.

772
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.960
I'm not gonna risk a forest fire

773
00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.730
just so you can shower before Monday.

774
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:39.860
Okay?
- It's raining.

775
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.940
How does one start a forest
fire when it's raining?

776
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.363
- How does one start a
fire when it's raining?

777
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.220
- You're ridiculous.

778
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.630
I'm not gonna risk a brush fire

779
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:54.951
when I know how to get us to
safety without it. all right?

780
00:38:54.951 --> 00:38:55.784
- I hope you know what you're doing.

781
00:38:55.784 --> 00:38:56.617
- I do.

782
00:39:00.615 --> 00:39:01.478
I promise.

783
00:39:01.478 --> 00:39:04.061
(gentle music)

784
00:39:07.218 --> 00:39:09.801
(Claire sighs)

785
00:39:14.864 --> 00:39:17.614
(birds chirping)

786
00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.757
(rain dripping)

787
00:39:26.306 --> 00:39:29.100
- We're being forced
to wait out this storm

788
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.750
underneath these trees.

789
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:33.703
And I think we're actually
through the worst of it.

790
00:39:34.946 --> 00:39:38.230
but I just hope wherever
Claire is she's safe and warm.

791
00:39:40.587 --> 00:39:43.490
(camera beeps)

792
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:45.830
- So you put those
videos up on the internet

793
00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.113
and people watch them.

794
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.251
And that's how you make a living.

795
00:39:50.251 --> 00:39:51.120
(Joey laughs)

796
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.070
How does that work?

797
00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:55.190
How do you make money off
of recording your life?

798
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:58.060
- Well. when enough people
want to know what you're up to.

799
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.450
you can influence them. you know?

800
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:04.990
And. and companies will pay
you to mention their products.

801
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:08.263
always casually and tastefully. of course.

802
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.750
I just. I haven't done that yet out here

803
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:15.070
because you know. to be honest.

804
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:16.760
I. I think it'd be absolutely disgusting

805
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.730
to exploit this particular situation.

806
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.533
What with Claire still missing and all.

807
00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.810
You don't really get out much. do ya?

808
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:27.823
I mean socially.

809
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:31.380
- No. not really.

810
00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.469
Does it show.

811
00:40:32.469 --> 00:40:35.330
- (laughs) What do you do on weekends?

812
00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.360
You have any friends to hang out with or?

813
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.220
- I mostly hang out here in the mountains.

814
00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.367
Like Bob Ross said.

815
00:40:41.367 --> 00:40:43.310
"There's nothing wrong with
having a tree as a friend."

816
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:45.980
- I do love Bob Ross.

817
00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:46.920
- Me too!

818
00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.210
- Seriously. watching him paint

819
00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:50.091
is the best lullaby out there.

820
00:40:50.091 --> 00:40:51.012
- I know!

821
00:40:51.012 --> 00:40:54.220
- (laughs) Well. you gotta
have some actual people

822
00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.520
to talk to as well though.

823
00:40:56.757 --> 00:40:58.416
- I call my grandma once a week

824
00:40:58.416 --> 00:40:59.250
(Joey groans)

825
00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.840
and we have some lovely.
lovely conversations.

826
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.840
- Nat. (laughs) you gotta
find some people your own age.

827
00:41:07.023 --> 00:41:10.500
I mean. look. your Nan and
Bob Ross are both exceptional.

828
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:14.020
Make no mistake. but (laughs) come on.

829
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.770
the list has gotta be a bit longer.

830
00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.420
- People can be mean.

831
00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.420
Nature can't hurt you the way people do.

832
00:41:21.594 --> 00:41:22.894
- I don't know about that.

833
00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.150
Nature beat me and Claire
up pretty bad in 24 hours.

834
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.770
- Well. nature didn't do that.

835
00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:32.490
You did! Nature just is.

836
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.400
You gotta learn how to respect it.

837
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.990
- Well. okay. Aye. aye. Ranger Nat.

838
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:40.543
I will learn to respect nature. I promise.

839
00:41:42.727 --> 00:41:45.770
(birds chirping)

840
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:48.800
Look. maybe it's not my place to say.

841
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.350
but you might want to give
people a chance as well.

842
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.630
I mean. just because you
had one sour experience

843
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:56.820
with someone. it doesn't mean

844
00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.445
that everyone's gonna treat you that way.

845
00:41:58.445 --> 00:41:59.278
You know?

846
00:42:00.445 --> 00:42:03.173
Isn't that what life's
all about? Relationships?

847
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.267
Oh. why wasn't I recording that?

848
00:42:08.267 --> 00:42:10.743
Did you hear how smart I just sounded?

849
00:42:12.444 --> 00:42:13.277
(horse whickering)

850
00:42:13.277 --> 00:42:14.741
Come on. Joey.

851
00:42:14.741 --> 00:42:15.720
(horse neighing)

852
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.735
- Did you hear that?

853
00:42:16.735 --> 00:42:19.485
(dramatic music)

854
00:42:22.872 --> 00:42:24.559
(horse whickering)
(Natalie gasping)

855
00:42:24.559 --> 00:42:27.892
Hey. I think that's Bella. Colt's horse.

856
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:30.503
This is great.

857
00:42:31.617 --> 00:42:34.633
But it's not great that
Colt is not on her back.

858
00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.270
That's actually really bad.

859
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.448
- Don't worry. Nat.

860
00:42:40.448 --> 00:42:42.921
I'm something of an animal whisperer.

861
00:42:42.921 --> 00:42:45.671
(dramatic music)

862
00:42:47.629 --> 00:42:49.218
- Are you whispering?

863
00:42:49.218 --> 00:42:51.135
- Sh. We're connecting.

864
00:42:53.583 --> 00:42:55.333
It's all right. girl.

865
00:42:57.047 --> 00:43:00.420
You're so brave running
through that storm.

866
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.410
Where did you come from? Huh?

867
00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:04.353
Have you seen my girlfriend?

868
00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.140
That's it. Come on. (lips smacking)

869
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.550
Come to Buff. that's it.

870
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:24.873
Now. I'm just gonna hop on your back.

871
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:29.020
And you're gonna make me
look all kinds of heroic.

872
00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.839
As you show me. no. no. no!

873
00:43:30.839 --> 00:43:35.330
(hooves thudding)
(horse neighing)

874
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.153
(both sighing)

875
00:43:37.153 --> 00:43:37.986
- That was quite the connection.

876
00:43:37.986 --> 00:43:38.819
- Yeah.

877
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.210
(both sighing)

878
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:42.910
She'll be all right.

879
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:44.280
- Yeah. Yeah.

880
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.270
She's headed in the
direction of Colt's ranch.

881
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.273
What worries me is that she's
not with Colt or Claire.

882
00:43:51.681 --> 00:43:53.110
I'm gonna call search and rescue.

883
00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.030
Let them know they might be in trouble.

884
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.263
Base. this is Natalie.

885
00:44:00.055 --> 00:44:02.972
(birds screeching)

886
00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.010
- Come on. let's pick up the pace.

887
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:10.843
I want to see if we can get

888
00:44:10.843 --> 00:44:12.228
to the radio station in half the time.

889
00:44:12.228 --> 00:44:15.343
- (groans) I'm moving as quickly as I can.

890
00:44:20.072 --> 00:44:20.940
- If I make it back tonight.

891
00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.060
I still have time to call Jason.

892
00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.588
who I'm sure is freaking out.

893
00:44:24.588 --> 00:44:25.421
- What are you-

894
00:44:25.421 --> 00:44:26.254
- Connect with the others.

895
00:44:26.254 --> 00:44:27.087
make sure everything is running smoothly

896
00:44:27.087 --> 00:44:29.290
for the launch for the new interface.

897
00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:30.920
Oh. and now that I'm carrying your things.

898
00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.510
you should be able to keep up with me.

899
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:34.670
- Look around.

900
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:35.503
- Huh?

901
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:37.540
- (laughs) Look around. Claire.

902
00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:40.834
When are you ever gonna be
in a place like this again?

903
00:44:40.834 --> 00:44:43.048
And you have it all to yourself.

904
00:44:43.048 --> 00:44:45.180
- (scoffs) Well. you're here.

905
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.263
- Claire. stop.

906
00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.853
Do you even know who
you are outside of work?

907
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:54.700
- There's nothing wrong with
being successful at work.

908
00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:58.060
Okay. it pays for my happiness.
my car. my apartment.

909
00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.993
- Money doesn't buy you happiness.

910
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.120
- Don't be cliche.

911
00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.653
- Cliches are cliches
because they're true.

912
00:45:05.814 --> 00:45:08.050
- (laughs) That's another cliche.

913
00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:12.360
- Claire. happiness is not
about notoriety or riches

914
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.661
or luxury cars or expensive clothes.

915
00:45:14.661 --> 00:45:17.170
It's. it's about people
loving and accepting you

916
00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:22.170
for who you are and you loving
and accepting them back.

917
00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.883
The good and the bad.

918
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:28.473
- I am loved and accepted.

919
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:30.790
And you know what?

920
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:32.650
Who are you to judge?

921
00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:33.980
We haven't talked in years.

922
00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:36.210
You don't know the
person that I've become.

923
00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:37.563
- Whose fault is that.

924
00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:45.863
If your job disappeared
tomorrow. what would you have?

925
00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.093
- I...

926
00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:52.400
I would have Buff.

927
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.150
- Buff. Buff. that's his name? Buff.

928
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:57.380
- Sure is. I got that guy.

929
00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.840
- Wow. That guy. huh?

930
00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.620
Well. you just seem enamored by him.

931
00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.693
- Well. he accepts me as I am.

932
00:46:08.202 --> 00:46:09.035
- You know. Claire-

933
00:46:09.035 --> 00:46:10.690
- We don't need to get into the past.

934
00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:17.883
All I'm saying. just try to
slow down. just a little.

935
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:20.450
You might not mind the view.

936
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:24.172
(gentle music)

937
00:46:31.503 --> 00:46:34.586
(Colt laughs softly)

938
00:46:36.117 --> 00:46:39.450
(gentle peaceful music)

939
00:46:54.881 --> 00:46:57.293
- Base. this is Natalie.

940
00:46:57.293 --> 00:46:59.537
(both chattering)

941
00:46:59.537 --> 00:47:01.120
- Oh. look at that!

942
00:47:03.681 --> 00:47:04.939
Hello.

943
00:47:04.939 --> 00:47:07.522
(gentle music)

944
00:47:09.451 --> 00:47:11.529
- [Claire] Are you sure this is the way?

945
00:47:11.529 --> 00:47:13.946
- Let me help you.
- I got it.

946
00:47:19.009 --> 00:47:21.198
- It's super beautiful today.

947
00:47:21.198 --> 00:47:23.730
- Uh. I mean. look at all this.

948
00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:25.184
- Uh. why don't you put your phone down?

949
00:47:25.184 --> 00:47:29.279
Look at this waterfall.
it's beautiful. Right?

950
00:47:29.279 --> 00:47:31.862
(gentle music)

951
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:56.796
Did you bring the good weather?

952
00:47:56.796 --> 00:48:01.213
Because normally it is much
hotter this time of year.

953
00:48:05.481 --> 00:48:06.398
- You good?

954
00:48:10.798 --> 00:48:14.106
- Fun fact. this bridge was
built earlier this year.

955
00:48:14.106 --> 00:48:15.773
Eagle Scout project.

956
00:48:18.105 --> 00:48:19.176
- So I come out from
underneath the waterfall

957
00:48:19.176 --> 00:48:23.129
and there's a bear. who's taken
off with all of my clothes.

958
00:48:23.129 --> 00:48:24.706
I'm standing there soaking wet.

959
00:48:24.706 --> 00:48:29.247
So I go bolting after him.
buck naked through the forest.

960
00:48:29.247 --> 00:48:30.902
- Only bloom this time of year

961
00:48:30.902 --> 00:48:34.160
and just for a couple weeks. so.

962
00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.713
Don't pick them though.
or I'll have to fine you.

963
00:48:38.199 --> 00:48:41.588
(gentle music)

964
00:48:41.588 --> 00:48:46.588
(hooves thudding)
(horse whickering)

965
00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:54.460
- Hey. is that it?

966
00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.110
Oh. I told you we'd make
it here in half the time.

967
00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:01.483
Hot shower. here I come.

968
00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:06.250
Why didn't you say something?

969
00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:07.860
- I didn't want to burst your bubble.

970
00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.150
Besides. I knew you'd figure it out.

971
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:14.189
Building's been abandoned for
as long as I can remember.

972
00:49:14.189 --> 00:49:15.739
We still got a long ways to go.

973
00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:17.770
Don't be sad.

974
00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:19.890
Listen. you can already hear the river.

975
00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.673
It's just up ahead. okay. Come on.

976
00:49:25.418 --> 00:49:26.980
(water trickling)

977
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.220
- Are there any waterfalls
or dangerous rapids

978
00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.520
down this river?

979
00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.220
- Not anywhere nearby.

980
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.053
And certainly not between here

981
00:49:34.053 --> 00:49:36.653
and that ranger station
were headed for. why?

982
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.300
What are you thinking?

983
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.523
- Well. why don't we use the river?

984
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:45.449
Give our feet a break
and float down on it.

985
00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:48.093
- On. uh. what exactly?

986
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:52.960
- I dunno. Can't we build
a raft or something?

987
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.200
- That'll take a whole lot of something

988
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.054
you don't exactly have. Claire.

989
00:49:56.054 --> 00:49:58.923
- (laughs) And. what exactly is that.

990
00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:00.913
- Time?

991
00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:04.413
Your work deadline is rapidly
approaching. remember?

992
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.120
- Right.

993
00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:12.120
But. but we would be
saving time and energy

994
00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.763
if we float to the ranger station.

995
00:50:16.207 --> 00:50:18.624
(Colt sighs)

996
00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.570
- I guess we could go look

997
00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:23.470
at that old abandoned
shack we just passed.

998
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:24.800
- [Claire] We can!

999
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.851
- Maybe we could build some...

1000
00:50:26.851 --> 00:50:29.434
(upbeat music)

1001
00:50:44.837 --> 00:50:47.020
If there was a door we
could probably use it

1002
00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.270
for the base of the raft.

1003
00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:57.301
- [Claire] Or we could just use. uh. this.

1004
00:50:57.301 --> 00:50:59.884
(gentle music)

1005
00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.983
- Yeah. I guess that'd work.

1006
00:51:06.851 --> 00:51:08.795
(birds chirping)

1007
00:51:08.795 --> 00:51:13.795
(water trickling)
(upbeat music)

1008
00:51:28.213 --> 00:51:29.046
(upbeat music)

1009
00:51:29.046 --> 00:51:31.640
- Whoo. oh. the trick
to keeping your balance

1010
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.440
is to look directly in front of you.

1011
00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.200
See that peak. I wanted
to build a cabin up there.

1012
00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.033
- Oh.
- Couldn't afford it.

1013
00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:45.628
- [Joey] Just gotta
believe in yourself. Nat.

1014
00:51:45.628 --> 00:51:48.795
(gentle upbeat music)

1015
00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:01.860
(water gurgling)
(birds chirping)

1016
00:52:06.959 --> 00:52:08.920
(bird screeching)

1017
00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.363
- Oh hey. look. Red tail hawk.

1018
00:52:13.294 --> 00:52:15.310
You know that reminds me of?

1019
00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:16.520
- Mm.

1020
00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.830
- Our high school mascot.

1021
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:19.990
And the first time I ever saw you.

1022
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:22.290
- Oh. no. not this story.

1023
00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:25.893
- Mm-hmm. I'd never seen
such a fearless freshmen.

1024
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:29.160
No one. and I mean no
one. wanted to put on

1025
00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:32.960
that mangy old mascot
costume for the rally.

1026
00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:35.670
The football team wanted
to burn the thing.

1027
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:38.773
but you insisted it would
boost school spirit.

1028
00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:43.550
I'll never forget the way you
held your head up in defiance

1029
00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:46.540
as you walked up to that sad pile

1030
00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:49.270
of sweaty feathers and fur.

1031
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:52.414
put that stupid thing
on in front of everyone.

1032
00:52:52.414 --> 00:52:54.400
(Clair laughs)

1033
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.870
This little blonde freshman.

1034
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:58.980
just determined to rally the entire school

1035
00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:01.253
in a re-painted chicken outfit.

1036
00:53:04.607 --> 00:53:08.650
Ah. then. you ran around the
field. flapping your wings.

1037
00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:10.003
giving everyone high five.

1038
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.700
- Oh. that thing. it smelled so bad.

1039
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.603
- [Colt] Yeah. I can imagine.

1040
00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:18.940
They all cheered.

1041
00:53:20.778 --> 00:53:22.523
- (laughs) I don't know
what I was thinking.

1042
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:25.410
- I know what I was thinking.

1043
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:28.610
I was thinking no one
could have pulled off being

1044
00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:33.033
a sweaty. overly cheerful.
bird of prey better than you.

1045
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.513
You know. I smiled a lot that day.

1046
00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:40.600
Watching the game and watching you soar

1047
00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.130
through the bleachers majestically.

1048
00:53:42.130 --> 00:53:44.404
giving out blind high fives.

1049
00:53:44.404 --> 00:53:47.071
(both laughing)

1050
00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.290
I just had to know who
you were after that.

1051
00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:57.000
- You know. I only did
that because Gina insisted

1052
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.710
that we change our mascot to a kitten.

1053
00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:02.393
- Yes. Gina. the captain
of the cheerleaders.

1054
00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:05.393
- Weren't you two dating at the time?

1055
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:10.060
- Yeah. Yes. she wasn't so bad.

1056
00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:12.524
Really. really into cats. though.

1057
00:54:12.524 --> 00:54:14.083
Like crazy into cats.

1058
00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:22.122
- So are there any Gina's
currently in your life?

1059
00:54:22.122 --> 00:54:24.930
(gentle music)

1060
00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:27.003
- Uh. nope.

1061
00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:31.843
No one serious since you.

1062
00:54:31.843 --> 00:54:34.426
(gentle music)

1063
00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:41.253
Well. you know. this boat
isn't going to row itself.

1064
00:54:42.788 --> 00:54:45.955
(gentle upbeat music)

1065
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:09.520
- Well. we're still going
and it's nearly 4:00 p.m..

1066
00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.305
which means around this time
yesterday Claire slipped and-

1067
00:55:12.305 --> 00:55:14.070
(battery beeping)
Oh. oop.

1068
00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:15.487
Hold on.

1069
00:55:15.487 --> 00:55:16.940
Better finally died.

1070
00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:20.841
- Oh. darn. (laughs)

1071
00:55:20.841 --> 00:55:23.047
I guess we'll just have to enjoy nature

1072
00:55:23.047 --> 00:55:26.740
and share and like each
other's company or something.

1073
00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:30.103
- Oh. nah. come on. Nat. Come prepared.

1074
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:32.830
- [Natalie] What. what is that?

1075
00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:34.890
- It's a portable charger.

1076
00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:36.337
Come on.

1077
00:55:36.337 --> 00:55:38.856
(Natalie laughs)
(Natalie grunts)

1078
00:55:38.856 --> 00:55:40.497
(charger clattering)

1079
00:55:40.497 --> 00:55:43.247
(dramatic music)

1080
00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:46.653
- I'm sorry.

1081
00:55:46.653 --> 00:55:51.260
I don't. I don't know what. oh! (grunting)

1082
00:55:52.828 --> 00:55:54.093
(phone clattering)

1083
00:55:54.093 --> 00:55:56.947
There we go. Samesies! (laughs)

1084
00:55:59.074 --> 00:56:01.590
I'm just gonna go get our phones back.

1085
00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:04.340
(dramatic music)

1086
00:56:10.256 --> 00:56:13.006
(birds chirping)

1087
00:56:15.835 --> 00:56:17.341
Joey!

1088
00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:18.174
Joey. come look!

1089
00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:22.893
Look!

1090
00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:30.693
- Claire-bear! Um. (grunting)

1091
00:56:35.273 --> 00:56:39.100
What was she doing all
the way up in this tree?

1092
00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.303
And more importantly. why
did she leave the jacket

1093
00:56:42.303 --> 00:56:45.753
I gave her for her
birthday up here? (panting)

1094
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:51.120
- Joey. this is a good thing.

1095
00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.760
It means we're on the right track.

1096
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.760
Let's just keep making our way down river.

1097
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:58.750
- Yeah. but who's keeping
her warm now. though?

1098
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:59.810
- Maybe Colt.

1099
00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:03.813
- Oh. don't say that.

1100
00:57:06.677 --> 00:57:07.827
- Oh. there's my phone.

1101
00:57:09.759 --> 00:57:12.342
(upbeat music)

1102
00:57:24.715 --> 00:57:27.630
- (groans) I would do anything
for a steak right now.

1103
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:30.123
Ooh. or cheeseburger with extra pickles.

1104
00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:32.240
You know. at this point.

1105
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.140
I'd even settle for a grilled hot dog.

1106
00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.450
- How about a grilled fish instead?

1107
00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:41.994
- Wait. really?

1108
00:57:41.994 --> 00:57:44.639
Wax on. wax off.

1109
00:57:44.639 --> 00:57:46.149
- Just wait.

1110
00:57:46.149 --> 00:57:48.982
(water trickling)

1111
00:57:53.171 --> 00:57:55.111
(Claire gasping)

1112
00:57:55.111 --> 00:57:57.313
- (laughs) Wax on!

1113
00:57:58.210 --> 00:57:59.043
- Teach me.

1114
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.110
- You sure?

1115
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:04.100
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1116
00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.143
All right.

1117
00:58:05.143 --> 00:58:08.380
Now. you want to approach
him from downstream. okay?

1118
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:09.770
- Why's that?

1119
00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:11.340
- They spend most of the
time swimming upstream.

1120
00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:13.850
You want to get behind them. all right.

1121
00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:15.693
Now. let's see. Ooh.

1122
00:58:16.527 --> 00:58:18.937
All right. great. great.
Nice. nice. nice. okay.

1123
00:58:18.937 --> 00:58:21.480
Now slowly put your
hands down into the water

1124
00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:24.620
and let it come down to you all right?

1125
00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:26.669
Oh. almost. almost.

1126
00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:27.620
- This is impossible.

1127
00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:30.270
- Not impossible. Just a little tricky.

1128
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:33.340
All right. oh look. right there.

1129
00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:34.173
Perfect.

1130
00:58:34.173 --> 00:58:39.173
Now wait for it to come down to you.

1131
00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:42.973
Wait for it to get close enough
to cup your hands around it.

1132
00:58:42.973 --> 00:58:44.120
to come down to you. but be careful.

1133
00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.123
Sometimes they can-

1134
00:58:45.123 --> 00:58:46.617
(Claire gasps)

1135
00:58:46.617 --> 00:58:47.872
(fish thudding)

1136
00:58:47.872 --> 00:58:49.717
- (laughs) You did it.

1137
00:58:49.717 --> 00:58:51.970
- I did it! I did it. I did it!

1138
00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:53.390
Ow!
- Oh. okay.

1139
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:54.567
- I think it bit me.

1140
00:58:55.657 --> 00:58:57.180
- Ah. yeah. that can happen sometimes.

1141
00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:58.193
I tried to warn ya.

1142
00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:00.410
Here let me take a look.

1143
00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:03.240
It's not that bad.

1144
00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.460
I don't even think it
needs a Band-Aid. hm. here.

1145
00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:07.963
- Oh. hey.
- All better.

1146
00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:12.673
- Thank you.

1147
00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:14.671
- [Colt] It's nothing.

1148
00:59:14.671 --> 00:59:16.470
And. look. if you really
think you need a Band-Aid

1149
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:17.397
we can go get one.

1150
00:59:17.397 --> 00:59:19.453
- No. I mean. thank you for finding me.

1151
00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:23.900
- You're welcome.

1152
00:59:28.444 --> 00:59:31.073
(throat clearing) All right.
Let's see what we got.

1153
00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.870
I assume you're gonna want
to gut yours yourself?

1154
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:37.703
(Claire giggles)

1155
00:59:37.703 --> 00:59:39.537
Come on.
- You assume wrong.

1156
00:59:39.537 --> 00:59:40.965
- Come on.
- Mm. mm.

1157
00:59:40.965 --> 00:59:43.620
No. no. no. All right.

1158
00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:44.730
I guess it wouldn't be fair to make you do

1159
00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:45.820
all the work now. would it?

1160
00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:48.410
- Right.
- (groans) Nevermind.

1161
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:49.430
I don't want to.

1162
00:59:51.513 --> 00:59:53.641
(crickets chirping)

1163
00:59:53.641 --> 00:59:56.141
(owl hooting)

1164
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:58.880
- So there I am trying
to put out three fires

1165
00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.670
in three separate spots
that refuse to go out.

1166
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:03.200
And the two volunteers I'm training

1167
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.270
are just stand there
doing absolutely nothing.

1168
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.580
Mouths open. gaping at me

1169
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.560
while I'm (laughs) I'm dancing around.

1170
01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.113
trying to stomp out the flames.

1171
01:00:13.071 --> 01:00:13.904
It was unbelievable.

1172
01:00:13.904 --> 01:00:15.793
- Well. they were mesmerized
by your dance moves.

1173
01:00:16.743 --> 01:00:19.583
- I do have some pretty
sweet moves. (laughs)

1174
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:22.818
- This was delicious.

1175
01:00:22.818 --> 01:00:24.150
- Mm.

1176
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.723
- Worth every fish bone
I accidentally swallowed.

1177
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.900
- Well. now you can go back
and tell your employees

1178
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.990
that you not only caught a
fish with your bare hands.

1179
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:34.393
but you ate it whole. bones and all.

1180
01:00:34.393 --> 01:00:36.380
- It's great rumor for the office.

1181
01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.880
Make them all terrified of me.

1182
01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:41.920
- You can do it as soon as tomorrow.

1183
01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.673
We're only about 15 or so
miles from ranger station.

1184
01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:48.600
- The sun's down.

1185
01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.200
- Mm.

1186
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.573
- Probably don't want to
navigate the river in the dark.

1187
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.870
We should just camp here.

1188
01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.583
Pick it up again in the morning.

1189
01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.453
- Okay. your choice.

1190
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.280
(gentle music)
(water trickling)

1191
01:01:19.061 --> 01:01:20.728
What happened to us?

1192
01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:28.400
- I think I just needed to
see what I could do on my own.

1193
01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.480
- You know. I keep replaying that argument

1194
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.640
we had before you left over in my mind.

1195
01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:41.723
And I just. it. what did
I say that made you run?

1196
01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.880
- I was young and it was a long time ago.

1197
01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:52.873
I don't. I don't really remember.

1198
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:58.593
I think I want to get some sleep.

1199
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.290
- Here. (throat clearing) just wear this.

1200
01:02:04.864 --> 01:02:08.718
It's warm enough tonight. I won't need it.

1201
01:02:08.718 --> 01:02:10.084
- Thank you.

1202
01:02:10.084 --> 01:02:12.667
(gentle music)

1203
01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:25.802
(footsteps thudding)

1204
01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:36.517
- Sorry for throwing your
phone into the bushes earlier.

1205
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:40.260
- No. that's all right.

1206
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.110
You did find me another one
that looked just like it. so.

1207
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:46.120
Plus it led me to Claire's jacket.

1208
01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.693
which is currently serving
as a very nice pillow.

1209
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:54.547
I am on my phone a lot. eh.

1210
01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:01.466
It's just my job sorta
requires it. you know?

1211
01:03:01.466 --> 01:03:03.770
(crickets chirping)

1212
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:04.850
It's funny. when I was a kid.

1213
01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:07.970
I thought I'd be a storm chaser.

1214
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:09.093
- Really?
- Yeah.

1215
01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:11.953
- That's why you were so

1216
01:03:11.953 --> 01:03:14.183
into those cumulonimbus clouds yesterday.

1217
01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.790
- You know your clouds. Nat.

1218
01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:17.710
- I sure do.

1219
01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:20.620
There's also just a regular
cumulus clouds. stratus clouds.

1220
01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:23.510
stratocumulus. altocumulus. altostratus-

1221
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:27.483
- Aw. settle down. champ. (laughs)

1222
01:03:29.177 --> 01:03:31.250
(birds chirping)

1223
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:32.140
(gentle music)

1224
01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.913
- Why didn't you? Become
a storm chaser. I mean?

1225
01:03:38.406 --> 01:03:40.006
- I was never any good at maths.

1226
01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:46.485
It turns out storms are a lot of science.

1227
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:48.823
Science is a lot of maths.

1228
01:03:52.597 --> 01:03:53.680
I don't know.

1229
01:03:55.890 --> 01:03:58.100
I guess it was just easier
to take my phone out

1230
01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.880
and make adventures
rather than chasing them.

1231
01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:10.220
- You should be a storm chaser.

1232
01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:13.690
I mean. if you like making
videos for people or sponsors.

1233
01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:15.343
whatever. you keep doing it.

1234
01:04:17.133 --> 01:04:19.670
but it kind of sound like
you gave up on a dream.

1235
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:22.160
- Well. (laughs) well. it's not as easy

1236
01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.410
as just declaring I'm now a storm chaser.

1237
01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:26.950
I'd have to go back to school.

1238
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:27.940
- Then go back to school.

1239
01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:29.770
- Well. I'd need a tutor
for the math stuff.

1240
01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:30.603
- Get a tutor.

1241
01:04:30.603 --> 01:04:32.543
- (laughs) Oh. you are relentless. Nat.

1242
01:04:35.194 --> 01:04:36.840
You should be a life coach or-

1243
01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.673
- Math tutor.

1244
01:04:42.189 --> 01:04:44.033
(laughs) I like my job.

1245
01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.477
I love my job. (sighs)

1246
01:04:50.023 --> 01:04:52.606
(gentle music)

1247
01:04:55.063 --> 01:04:57.396
- I'm glad you're here. Nat.

1248
01:05:00.175 --> 01:05:01.008
- Me too.

1249
01:05:04.957 --> 01:05:09.957
(Joey sighs)
(gentle music)

1250
01:05:18.561 --> 01:05:23.561
(birds chirping)
(water trickling)

1251
01:05:36.751 --> 01:05:39.334
(Claire sighs)

1252
01:05:40.189 --> 01:05:43.356
(helicopter whirring)

1253
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:49.970
- Hey. Hey. there's a helicopter!

1254
01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:50.803
Colt. wake up.

1255
01:05:50.803 --> 01:05:52.410
There's a helicopter. Hey!

1256
01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.470
Are you seriously sleeping through this?

1257
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:58.303
Hey!

1258
01:06:00.501 --> 01:06:01.940
(Colt groaning)

1259
01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:03.410
We missed it.

1260
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:05.817
It was right there and we missed it.

1261
01:06:05.817 --> 01:06:07.060
- No. big deal. Claire.

1262
01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.710
We're only a couple of miles
from the ranger station.

1263
01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:11.943
- What?

1264
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:16.825
Last night you said we
were 15 or so miles away.

1265
01:06:16.825 --> 01:06:20.867
- Okay. (throat clearing)
look. Claire. um-

1266
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:24.033
- You lied to me.

1267
01:06:24.033 --> 01:06:25.380
- I know. I shouldn't lie.

1268
01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:30.113
But I was having such
a nice time and I just.

1269
01:06:30.113 --> 01:06:32.610
you know. I didn't want things to end.

1270
01:06:32.610 --> 01:06:34.960
- So you fudged the numbers knowing

1271
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.050
that I would only agree to stay

1272
01:06:36.050 --> 01:06:37.900
if I thought we were far enough away.

1273
01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:41.330
- I know it was wrong of me. okay.

1274
01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:44.610
- Do you want to know why I
left you all those years ago?

1275
01:06:44.610 --> 01:06:47.900
I left because we never
wanted the same things.

1276
01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:50.560
You wanted to stay in a tiny
little town that you grew up in

1277
01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.680
and it made me feel guilty

1278
01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.480
for wanting to pursue my own career.

1279
01:06:54.386 --> 01:06:56.140
- Do you think that is any excuse

1280
01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:59.150
for you just disappearing
without an explanation?

1281
01:06:59.150 --> 01:07:00.743
We were engaged. Claire.

1282
01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:03.950
Do you have any idea what I went through

1283
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:06.483
not knowing why you up and left me?

1284
01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.070
And then after all this time you say

1285
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:11.420
it's because you thought we
didn't want the same things

1286
01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:13.690
or that that would somehow get in the way

1287
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:15.240
of the things you wanted to do.

1288
01:07:16.936 --> 01:07:18.320
You know what the real problem was?

1289
01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.100
We didn't talk about it
because you didn't want to.

1290
01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.733
you just made assumptions.

1291
01:07:24.852 --> 01:07:26.870
You know. you left that
ring on my front porch

1292
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:29.370
in the middle of the night
and you were just gone.

1293
01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:33.750
You know. I'm glad you left.

1294
01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:36.910
Because being married to you
would be like being married

1295
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:39.219
to a stubborn mule.

1296
01:07:39.219 --> 01:07:41.640
- (gasps) How dare you?

1297
01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:42.693
- Yeah. I said it.

1298
01:07:43.758 --> 01:07:46.178
- (huffs) You know what?

1299
01:07:46.178 --> 01:07:47.011
- Mm.
- I don't need you.

1300
01:07:47.011 --> 01:07:48.480
- Oh. you don't. after I got you

1301
01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.850
within a couple of miles
of the ranger station.

1302
01:07:49.850 --> 01:07:54.745
- You know what? This has got
to be the worst rescue ever.

1303
01:07:54.745 --> 01:07:55.578
(Colt scoffs)

1304
01:07:55.578 --> 01:07:56.830
You know what? Do me a favor.

1305
01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:58.650
Don't follow me.
- Done.

1306
01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:00.770
- And I really hope that
this doesn't reflect

1307
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:03.230
the actual efficiency and
capability of search and rescue.

1308
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:04.530
because if it does.

1309
01:08:04.530 --> 01:08:07.471
they should clean house starting with you.

1310
01:08:07.471 --> 01:08:11.971
- Oh. you. (sighs)

1311
01:08:15.231 --> 01:08:17.021
(birds chirping)

1312
01:08:17.021 --> 01:08:19.438
(Colt sighs)

1313
01:08:20.421 --> 01:08:23.540
(birds chirping)

1314
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:26.170
- So the trail is very
narrow at this point.

1315
01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:27.590
And there's this baby rattler

1316
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:29.680
just sunbathing right in the middle of it.

1317
01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.970
And there's tall grass on either side. so-

1318
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:33.760
- So of course you're not
gonna go stomping around

1319
01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.370
in there because you don't know

1320
01:08:35.370 --> 01:08:36.920
how many other baby rattlers there are.

1321
01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.863
- Exactly. (laughs) You get it.

1322
01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:42.576
- Uh. your shoe's untied.

1323
01:08:42.576 --> 01:08:43.409
- Oh! (laughs)

1324
01:08:43.409 --> 01:08:44.242
- Oh. sorry. sorry.

1325
01:08:44.242 --> 01:08:45.183
- No. I'm sorry.

1326
01:08:45.183 --> 01:08:46.016
- I just thought I'd.

1327
01:08:46.016 --> 01:08:47.590
- No. I would appreciate
the help. thank you.

1328
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:48.460
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1329
01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:50.128
- Yep. yep. careful.

1330
01:08:50.128 --> 01:08:50.961
- Thank you.

1331
01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:53.240
- I'll just. uh. I am an excellent tier

1332
01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.310
of shoe laces as you can-

1333
01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:55.371
- Oh. really.

1334
01:08:55.371 --> 01:08:56.204
- Yeah.

1335
01:08:57.863 --> 01:09:00.463
Oh look! (hissing)

1336
01:09:00.463 --> 01:09:02.145
Found two baby rattlers.

1337
01:09:02.145 --> 01:09:03.287
(Natalie yelps)

1338
01:09:03.287 --> 01:09:04.947
(laughs) Sorry. Sorry.

1339
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:08.663
There. good as new.

1340
01:09:09.621 --> 01:09:11.930
(gentle music)

1341
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:13.430
- Thanks.

1342
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:15.093
- Yeah. no. no worries.

1343
01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.073
Here.
- Oh. oh!

1344
01:09:17.073 --> 01:09:18.280
- Careful. careful.

1345
01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.403
- Oh. thank you.

1346
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:22.680
(gentle music)

1347
01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.147
Joey. I-

1348
01:09:24.147 --> 01:09:27.621
- I keep telling you. it's Buff.

1349
01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:32.621
- Buff. I should probably keep
it to myself. but whatever.

1350
01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:33.740
I'm gonna go out on a limb.

1351
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:36.230
And I just. I just have to say that I-

1352
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.930
- We never talked about it.

1353
01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:43.190
No. we never talked about it
because you never listened.

1354
01:09:43.190 --> 01:09:44.821
And at least I gave the ring back.

1355
01:09:44.821 --> 01:09:45.734
I mean. I could have just sold it.

1356
01:09:45.734 --> 01:09:48.467
(bear growling)

1357
01:09:48.467 --> 01:09:52.227
(footsteps thudding)

1358
01:09:52.227 --> 01:09:53.530
(bear growling)

1359
01:09:53.530 --> 01:09:55.753
- Claire. don't move.

1360
01:09:57.791 --> 01:09:59.541
- Colt. what do I do?

1361
01:10:08.466 --> 01:10:11.250
- I'm gonna crouch down very. very slowly.

1362
01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:15.250
I want you to climb on my
shoulders. very. very slowly.

1363
01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:16.643
- I'm scared.

1364
01:10:16.643 --> 01:10:18.060
- I know. me too.

1365
01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:24.490
- (gasping) No. don't let go.

1366
01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:25.813
I don't want to let go of your hand.

1367
01:10:26.887 --> 01:10:28.637
- You don't have to let go my hand.

1368
01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.428
I'm gonna let go of your hand.

1369
01:10:31.428 --> 01:10:32.261
- What?

1370
01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:33.094
- So you can wave them around.

1371
01:10:33.094 --> 01:10:33.931
The only way we're gonna survive this-

1372
01:10:33.931 --> 01:10:35.633
- No!
- Is to look bigger

1373
01:10:35.633 --> 01:10:38.443
and scarier than this bear. okay.

1374
01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:40.859
(Claire screaming)
(Colt roaring)

1375
01:10:40.859 --> 01:10:43.690
(both roaring)

1376
01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:45.443
- I. I um-

1377
01:10:45.443 --> 01:10:46.276
(Claire and Colt roaring)

1378
01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:47.109
- Wait a second.

1379
01:10:48.172 --> 01:10:49.005
Claire?

1380
01:10:49.908 --> 01:10:50.741
Claire!

1381
01:10:50.741 --> 01:10:52.274
(dramatic music)

1382
01:10:52.274 --> 01:10:54.078
(bear growling)

1383
01:10:54.078 --> 01:10:56.169
(both yelling)

1384
01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.860
- I think it's working.

1385
01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:58.693
(bear roaring)

1386
01:10:58.693 --> 01:10:59.526
Never mind.

1387
01:10:59.526 --> 01:11:01.556
- Oh. Claire. Claire. Claire. I can't see.

1388
01:11:01.556 --> 01:11:04.489
- Oh. sorry. sorry. sorry.

1389
01:11:04.489 --> 01:11:06.449
- Claire!
(Colt blubbering)

1390
01:11:06.449 --> 01:11:08.029
(Natalie gasping)
(Joey gasping)

1391
01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:08.862
Bear!

1392
01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:13.522
(both growling)

1393
01:11:13.522 --> 01:11:14.939
- Buff?
- Uh- huh?

1394
01:11:15.912 --> 01:11:18.334
- We need to do what they're doing.

1395
01:11:18.334 --> 01:11:20.123
I need to get on your shoulders.

1396
01:11:20.123 --> 01:11:21.390
(bear growling)

1397
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:23.513
- Nat. get on my shoulders.

1398
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:25.383
- I just said-

1399
01:11:25.383 --> 01:11:26.870
- Sh. trust me.

1400
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:28.070
I'm an animal whisperer.

1401
01:11:29.486 --> 01:11:32.236
(dramatic music)

1402
01:11:34.391 --> 01:11:37.891
(Colt and Claire roaring)

1403
01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:40.828
- Shoo! Get out of here.
(Joey roaring)

1404
01:11:40.828 --> 01:11:42.156
Get on out of here!

1405
01:11:42.156 --> 01:11:44.054
Shoo. get away!
(all roaring)

1406
01:11:44.054 --> 01:11:45.097
(all yelling)

1407
01:11:45.097 --> 01:11:47.097
- Get out here!
- Go. go!

1408
01:11:48.311 --> 01:11:50.211
(all cheering)

1409
01:11:50.211 --> 01:11:51.648
- Ah. yes!

1410
01:11:51.648 --> 01:11:54.231
(gentle music)

1411
01:11:55.568 --> 01:11:58.471
(Claire and Colt gasping)

1412
01:11:58.471 --> 01:12:00.127
Whoa. whoa.

1413
01:12:00.127 --> 01:12:02.019
- (laughing) Yeah!

1414
01:12:02.019 --> 01:12:04.338
(both gasping)

1415
01:12:04.338 --> 01:12:05.171
My heart.

1416
01:12:05.171 --> 01:12:06.519
- Oh. I thought we we're gonna die.

1417
01:12:06.519 --> 01:12:08.360
(both panting)

1418
01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.610
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1419
01:12:11.936 --> 01:12:12.769
- Claire!

1420
01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.337
You're all right. Oh. oh!

1421
01:12:16.337 --> 01:12:17.333
- Hey. Colt.

1422
01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:19.459
- Hey. Natalie.

1423
01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:22.630
- I said. I'd find you. didn't I. Nat?

1424
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:24.002
And I totally did.

1425
01:12:24.002 --> 01:12:26.368
- You sure did.

1426
01:12:26.368 --> 01:12:29.329
- Oh. hey mate. Joey Bufalino.

1427
01:12:29.329 --> 01:12:30.162
- Hey.

1428
01:12:30.162 --> 01:12:32.167
- Would you actually
do me a bit of a favor

1429
01:12:32.167 --> 01:12:34.907
and just keep this pointed this
direction just for a moment.

1430
01:12:34.907 --> 01:12:37.233
- Um?
- Yeah. perfect.

1431
01:12:42.194 --> 01:12:44.944
(dramatic music)

1432
01:12:48.326 --> 01:12:51.489
- What. what. what. what are you doing?

1433
01:12:51.489 --> 01:12:52.540
- I mean. it's not exactly

1434
01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:55.353
as I imagined it. but. Claire.

1435
01:12:58.370 --> 01:12:59.713
will you marry me?

1436
01:13:02.426 --> 01:13:07.426
- Um. what. um.

1437
01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.070
- Or. we don't have to.

1438
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:11.840
I mean. we. we don't.

1439
01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.080
- We can-

1440
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.187
- But we can. no. we
should. no. but we can.

1441
01:13:14.187 --> 01:13:16.106
We can still. we can.

1442
01:13:16.106 --> 01:13:18.250
- Congrats. (laughs)

1443
01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:19.083
- Congrats.

1444
01:13:20.411 --> 01:13:24.161
(Joey and Claire stammering)

1445
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:30.320
- Yep. Cheers for that.

1446
01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.626
Capturing that nice
little romantic gem of a-

1447
01:13:33.626 --> 01:13:34.760
- Yeah. Whew.

1448
01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.346
- Of a moment.

1449
01:13:36.346 --> 01:13:39.210
And. and thank you also for especially

1450
01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:40.863
for looking after Claire.

1451
01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:45.325
- Yep. just doing my job.

1452
01:13:45.325 --> 01:13:46.158
- I'd call a chopper.

1453
01:13:46.158 --> 01:13:50.110
but the ranger station is.
it's pretty close by. I-

1454
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:53.530
- Well. I'm sure Claire is
actually pretty exhausted.

1455
01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:55.283
- Oh no. we. we can walk.

1456
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:58.655
- And there you have it.

1457
01:13:58.655 --> 01:13:59.488
- Okay. Okay.

1458
01:13:59.488 --> 01:14:00.780
I'll just. I'll call. search and rescue

1459
01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:03.943
to let them know that you two are safe.

1460
01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:08.165
And that the path to the ranger
station is just that way.

1461
01:14:08.165 --> 01:14:11.480
I have a truck. I can take
you two back to your vehicle.

1462
01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.692
- Thank you.

1463
01:14:12.692 --> 01:14:13.525
(dramatic music)

1464
01:14:13.525 --> 01:14:14.525
- Follow me.

1465
01:14:15.737 --> 01:14:17.128
- After you. uh.

1466
01:14:17.128 --> 01:14:18.961
- [Claire] Yeah. okay.

1467
01:14:20.126 --> 01:14:22.709
(gentle music)

1468
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:26.890
- Base. this is Natalie Pritchard.

1469
01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:27.723
Do you copy?

1470
01:14:28.596 --> 01:14:31.179
(gentle music)

1471
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:37.633
- Oh. I. um. found something of yours.

1472
01:14:40.081 --> 01:14:41.703
You left this up in a tree.

1473
01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:45.293
- [Claire] I used it as a
pillow when I slept up there.

1474
01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.420
- You slept in a tree?

1475
01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:52.160
- Yeah. then I got so
distracted seeing Colt again.

1476
01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.800
I must've completely forgot it.

1477
01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.360
- Again? You two know each other.

1478
01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.303
- Yeah.

1479
01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:02.170
It's a long story.

1480
01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:03.793
I'll tell you in the car.

1481
01:15:04.743 --> 01:15:05.576
- Okay.

1482
01:15:05.576 --> 01:15:08.159
(gentle music)

1483
01:15:27.613 --> 01:15:30.530
(engine puttering)

1484
01:15:36.001 --> 01:15:38.751
(birds chirping)

1485
01:15:42.146 --> 01:15:44.720
(Colt sighs)

1486
01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.720
- We saw your horse.

1487
01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:47.543
- Was she all right?

1488
01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:48.580
- Yeah.

1489
01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:49.930
- [Colt] Good. okay.

1490
01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:51.920
- We couldn't catch her though.

1491
01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.403
She got away pretty quick.

1492
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:57.517
- Yeah. well. she's not the only one.

1493
01:15:58.622 --> 01:16:00.480
(gentle music)

1494
01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.080
- How many horses have you lost?

1495
01:16:05.886 --> 01:16:06.803
- Oh. yeah.

1496
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:32.700
- You should have phone signal now.

1497
01:16:33.683 --> 01:16:35.415
I'm sure you got a lot of calls to make.

1498
01:16:35.415 --> 01:16:37.165
- Oh no. That's okay.

1499
01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:40.902
I don't want to dig for my
cell phone right now. (laughs)

1500
01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:45.803
- So. uh. this Colt. gentlemen.

1501
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:48.933
how did you two know each other?

1502
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:53.193
- We were engaged.

1503
01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:56.410
It was years ago.

1504
01:16:56.410 --> 01:16:59.110
I guess you could say we
were high school sweethearts.

1505
01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:05.040
- I see. Wow. I had no idea.

1506
01:17:07.918 --> 01:17:12.633
(sighs) I asked him to record my proposal.

1507
01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.653
- I'm sorry. I should should've
mentioned that before-

1508
01:17:15.653 --> 01:17:18.183
- No. it. no. it's fine.

1509
01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:23.420
My proposal was. it was weird.

1510
01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:24.253
Wasn't it?

1511
01:17:26.050 --> 01:17:27.600
- I mean-

1512
01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.980
- Yeah. totally weird.

1513
01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:32.850
Just the. oh. oh no.

1514
01:17:32.850 --> 01:17:34.750
I had so much adrenaline leftover

1515
01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:37.420
from fighting the bear. you know. that.

1516
01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:38.997
- Um. I don't think that's-

1517
01:17:38.997 --> 01:17:40.470
- And I wasn't thinking.

1518
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:42.450
And then I just. I got down on one knee

1519
01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:43.960
even though the moment wasn't right

1520
01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:47.560
and I just asked you to
marry me and I don't yeah.

1521
01:17:50.576 --> 01:17:52.083
That's what this trip was for. you know?

1522
01:17:54.088 --> 01:17:55.538
Yeah. to ask you to marry me.

1523
01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:02.143
But then after I did it. I just
felt like I shouldn't have.

1524
01:18:06.222 --> 01:18:09.821
(Claire laughing)

1525
01:18:09.821 --> 01:18:10.654
I'm trying to be-

1526
01:18:10.654 --> 01:18:13.560
- Buff. you took the
ring back off my finger.

1527
01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.991
- Oh. well.

1528
01:18:14.991 --> 01:18:15.850
(Claire laughing)

1529
01:18:15.850 --> 01:18:17.720
You just looked so.

1530
01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:21.340
I mean. I thought that you
were like. okay. you know.

1531
01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:24.573
- I know it wasn't. it
wasn't right. was it?

1532
01:18:26.425 --> 01:18:28.160
(Joey sighs)

1533
01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.043
Maybe we should-

1534
01:18:30.579 --> 01:18:33.870
- Oh. I'm sorry. Claire. (laughs)

1535
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:36.490
Claire. I took the ring
back off your finger.

1536
01:18:36.490 --> 01:18:37.763
Who does that?

1537
01:18:39.643 --> 01:18:42.231
(Joey sighs)

1538
01:18:42.231 --> 01:18:45.050
I really am sorry. I. maybe

1539
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:48.203
we should have realized
this a while ago. (laughs)

1540
01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:52.680
- I think we realized it exactly
when we were supposed to.

1541
01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:00.363
- Oh. (laughs)

1542
01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:06.324
Gotta love that 30-day return policy.

1543
01:19:06.324 --> 01:19:09.157
(Claire laughing)

1544
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:13.924
- Hey. will you drop me off somewhere?

1545
01:19:13.924 --> 01:19:16.674
(dramatic music)

1546
01:19:17.637 --> 01:19:20.510
- I had a feeling you
were gonna ask me that.

1547
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:21.343
Course I can.

1548
01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.396
- But first. will you
help me record something?

1549
01:19:26.396 --> 01:19:28.979
(gentle music)

1550
01:20:06.277 --> 01:20:07.576
(dog barking)

1551
01:20:07.576 --> 01:20:11.920
- Wow. (laughs) This place is awesome.

1552
01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:15.263
I hope he still likes you.

1553
01:20:15.263 --> 01:20:16.343
- What if he doesn't?

1554
01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:22.843
- Is it true love?

1555
01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:28.043
- Yes.

1556
01:20:30.434 --> 01:20:31.627
- Then go on then.

1557
01:20:31.627 --> 01:20:34.835
(Claire giggling)

1558
01:20:34.835 --> 01:20:39.835
(gentle music)
(horses whinnying)

1559
01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.223
- Hey. you should call that Natalie girl.

1560
01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.960
She's really cute.

1561
01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.370
And I saw her hide her number in your pack

1562
01:20:47.370 --> 01:20:48.470
at the ranger station.

1563
01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:52.230
- Stop it!

1564
01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:54.380
- Guess she knew we
weren't gonna work out.

1565
01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:57.340
Take care of yourself. Buff.

1566
01:20:59.368 --> 01:21:01.951
(gentle music)

1567
01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:10.523
- [Claire] You rolling?

1568
01:21:10.523 --> 01:21:12.100
- [Joey] Yes. I am and you look gorgeous.

1569
01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.620
So whenever you're ready. take it away.

1570
01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.330
- Hello. everyone.

1571
01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:17.163
I don't have a lot of time to explain.

1572
01:21:17.163 --> 01:21:18.910
but I will be taking this next week off.

1573
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:20.943
And after that I'll be working remotely.

1574
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:24.340
I know this is coming at
you all hard and fast.

1575
01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:26.680
but I also know each and
every one of you are capable

1576
01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:27.910
of keeping things running smoothly

1577
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:29.400
without me hovering.

1578
01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:32.220
Kelly. you're the VP for a reason.

1579
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.820
It's about time I trust you handling

1580
01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:35.600
the day-to-day decisions.

1581
01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.490
Jason. you need to trust your instincts.

1582
01:21:38.490 --> 01:21:39.790
They're spot on.

1583
01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:42.520
It took falling off a cliff
and being swept down a river

1584
01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.990
for me to realize that I lost out

1585
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:47.190
on something extremely
important in my life.

1586
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:50.540
I'm excited to hear how the launch goes.

1587
01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:52.030
I'll be checking in next week.

1588
01:21:52.030 --> 01:21:55.448
Oh. and you're all getting raises.

1589
01:21:55.448 --> 01:21:58.615
(gentle upbeat music)

1590
01:22:02.267 --> 01:22:05.550
(camera clicking)

1591
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:08.570
- You know what would make
that photo even better?

1592
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:09.623
Some clouds.

1593
01:22:11.898 --> 01:22:16.898
- [Natalie] Buff! (laughing)

1594
01:22:18.198 --> 01:22:20.781
(gentle music)

1595
01:22:39.250 --> 01:22:40.850
- [Claire] I owe you an apology.

1596
01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:46.800
- Claire. what are you doing here?

1597
01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.930
- I'm sorry for everything

1598
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:51.810
that I put you through
the last couple of days

1599
01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:54.473
and a few more before then.

1600
01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.350
I had a lot of growing up to do

1601
01:22:59.450 --> 01:23:01.230
and I didn't want to admit it.

1602
01:23:02.150 --> 01:23:03.810
I was just. I was scared

1603
01:23:03.810 --> 01:23:06.410
that I would never amount to anything.

1604
01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:08.350
And I felt that running
away was my only option

1605
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:10.993
in order to prove that I
could be someone or something.

1606
01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:14.033
I know I was wrong.

1607
01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:17.640
And if I had just talked to you.

1608
01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:19.563
I would have realized
I could have had both.

1609
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.313
I screwed up.

1610
01:23:24.092 --> 01:23:24.925
I'm sorry.

1611
01:23:28.772 --> 01:23:32.300
- I'm sorry if I ever made you feel like

1612
01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:33.650
you couldn't confide in me.

1613
01:23:36.610 --> 01:23:39.460
I'm sorry again for
lying about the distance

1614
01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:40.673
to the ranger station.

1615
01:23:42.722 --> 01:23:43.972
I just really missed you.

1616
01:23:46.495 --> 01:23:47.328
I missed us.

1617
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:55.483
So. uh. what now?

1618
01:23:57.962 --> 01:24:00.190
- Well. I was kind of hoping

1619
01:24:00.190 --> 01:24:01.890
you would give me a second chance.

1620
01:24:03.547 --> 01:24:06.193
- (throat clearing) What about Bufalino?

1621
01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:09.380
- Well. this time I did the right thing

1622
01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:10.603
and we talked about it.

1623
01:24:12.570 --> 01:24:14.970
We both realized it was
never gonna work because

1624
01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:21.301
I'm still in love with someone else.

1625
01:24:21.301 --> 01:24:23.884
(gentle music)

1626
01:24:26.157 --> 01:24:28.853
- Claire. my place is here.

1627
01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:33.075
I don't want to come
between you and your career.

1628
01:24:33.075 --> 01:24:35.360
The last thing I want
to do is make you feel

1629
01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.517
like I'm holding you back.

1630
01:24:36.517 --> 01:24:37.443
- You don't.

1631
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:40.290
And the best part about being a CEO

1632
01:24:40.290 --> 01:24:43.240
in the 21st century is that
you can work from any location.

1633
01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.213
especially when you're
the owner and creator.

1634
01:24:50.370 --> 01:24:52.810
I've already reached out to my employees.

1635
01:24:52.810 --> 01:24:54.113
They'll understand.

1636
01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:56.662
- Claire. I-

1637
01:24:56.662 --> 01:24:58.212
- Are you gonna kiss me or not?

1638
01:24:59.971 --> 01:25:02.554
(gentle music)

1639
01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:16.643
- So what did you tell your employees?

1640
01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.880
- We can talk about that later.

1641
01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:23.811
Right now I want to ride off
into the sunset with you.

1642
01:25:23.811 --> 01:25:26.265
- A little cliche. don't think?

1643
01:25:26.265 --> 01:25:28.381
- Well. you know what
they say about cliches.

1644
01:25:28.381 --> 01:25:31.766
- Ah. yes. (laughs)

1645
01:25:31.766 --> 01:25:32.849
- I love you.

1646
01:25:34.268 --> 01:25:36.088
- I love you. Claire.

1647
01:25:36.088 --> 01:25:38.671
(gentle music)

1648
01:26:27.671 --> 01:26:30.838
(gentle upbeat music)

1649
01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:28.531
(gentle upbeat music continues)

1650
01:28:27.854 --> 01:28:30.521
(gentle music)
