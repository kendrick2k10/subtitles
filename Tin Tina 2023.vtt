THEOPHANY
(FROM THE GREEK THEOPHÁNEIA)

4
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.041
NATURAL OR SUPERNATURAL
MANIFESTATION OF GOD

5
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:48.708
Lord. you who looks at us
from your throne in Heaven

6
00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:51.666
and heed our prayers with benevolence.

7
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.208
Adolfo. do you take María de los Dolores
as your lawfully wedded wife.

8
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:03.375
and promise to be faithful to her
for better or for worse.

9
00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:05.416
in sickness and in health.

10
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.208
to love and to cherish her.
until death do you part?

11
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.750
I do.

12
00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:16.791
María de los Dolores. do you take Adolfo
as your lawfully wedded husband.

13
00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:20.750
and promise to be faithful to him.
for better or for worse.

14
00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:22.958
in sickness and in health.

15
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.208
to love and to cherish him.
until death do you part?

16
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:28.291
I do.

17
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500
May the Lord. in His kindness.

18
00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:44.916
strengthen the consent
you have declared before the Church.

19
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.916
and bring His blessings within you.

20
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:51.291
What God has joined.
let no one put asunder.

21
00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:52.958
Amen.

22
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:54.541
Amen.

23
00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.333
You may now kiss the bride.

24
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:21.750
SPAIN 1981

25
00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:34.916
Are you ready? Well. are you three ready?

26
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.833
We are.

27
00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:38.458
Here.

28
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:39.458
Thanks.

29
00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:42.458
I think I've got it.

30
00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:45.375
Luis and Marta.

31
00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:47.291
Too common.

32
00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:48.916
Common? Okay.

33
00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:51.208
Eustaquio and Candelaria?

34
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.791
That's horrible.

35
00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:56.125
I like names that symbolize something.

36
00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:57.750
That symbolize something?

37
00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:01.000
What about Adam and Eve?

38
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:04.416
Don't be silly.

39
00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:07.375
You'll be the best mom ever.

40
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:16.083
Long live the newlyweds!

41
00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:17.541
Hooray!

42
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.375
Long live the newlyweds!

43
00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:21.291
Hooray!

44
00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:22.875
Careful. please.

45
00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:30.000
What's wrong?

46
00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.416
Don't move!

47
00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:38.583
Silence!

48
00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:48.291
Silence!

49
00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:51.375
Yesterday. at 6:25 p.m..

50
00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:53.958
the most dramatic episode
in our country's history

51
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:56.541
since the beginning of democracy
took place.

52
00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:15.833
Adolfo. what happened?

53
00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:20.750
There were some complications.

54
00:04:21.916 --> 00:04:22.791
I'm really sorry.

55
00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:26.250
No.

56
00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:28.666
I must inform you that…

57
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:33.000
you suffered severe internal damage.

58
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:34.625
What?

59
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.250
I'm afraid you won't be able
to bear children.

60
00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:40.625
No.

61
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.375
I'm really sorry.

62
00:04:57.875 --> 00:04:58.833
Why me?

63
00:05:00.208 --> 00:05:01.791
-Why me?
-I know.

64
00:05:38.416 --> 00:05:39.791
It was my fault.

65
00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:41.500
It was my fault.

66
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:43.875
It was all my fault.

67
00:05:56.583 --> 00:05:57.416
Amen.

68
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.708
Lola. you look like a ghost.

69
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:50.708
Look at you.

70
00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:52.875
It's been six months.

71
00:06:54.666 --> 00:06:55.958
I need you to be okay.

72
00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.750
I'll do whatever you need.

73
00:07:00.416 --> 00:07:01.291
Anything.

74
00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:10.125
-Let's go back to our hometown.
-We're not going back.

75
00:07:10.208 --> 00:07:12.541
-But this house--
-The house isn't the problem.

76
00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:17.208
I had a wonderful childhood in this house.

77
00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.666
And our children will too.

78
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.333
Honey.

79
00:07:32.708 --> 00:07:34.583
There's a convent nearby.

80
00:07:34.666 --> 00:07:36.666
It's an orphanage.

81
00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:40.291
-Maybe we could go--
-No.

82
00:07:41.583 --> 00:07:44.041
We'll love them as if they were our own.

83
00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:45.083
-Honey.
-No.

84
00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:48.666
-When one door closes. another opens.
-What are you saying? No.

85
00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:05.458
Lola.

86
00:08:06.583 --> 00:08:08.000
I can't carry on like this.

87
00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:10.083
I just can't.

88
00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:23.041
TVE
PRESENTS

89
00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:25.583
EVERY THURSDAY FROM 7 TO 8

90
00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:40.916
If you're feeling sad and alone

91
00:08:41.666 --> 00:08:44.500
Don't worry. it'll soon pass

92
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.041
This country is out of control.

93
00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:06.000
Young people these days
lack essential values.

94
00:09:06.583 --> 00:09:07.458
They're lost.

95
00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:09.291
Abbess.

96
00:09:13.083 --> 00:09:14.375
Are you all right?

97
00:09:16.791 --> 00:09:18.625
My wife grew up in a convent.

98
00:09:20.666 --> 00:09:24.541
This sacred place was built
in the 15th century after Christ.

99
00:09:25.458 --> 00:09:30.958
Our lifestyle and doctrine are.
shall we say. old-school.

100
00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:37.500
We provide shelter and education
to abandoned children.

101
00:09:38.666 --> 00:09:40.583
Children from single mothers.

102
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:43.000
prostitutes.

103
00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:48.000
children with physical impairments.
with mental impairments.

104
00:09:48.583 --> 00:09:49.416
Right.

105
00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:18.291
How long would the paperwork take?

106
00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.625
That'll be sorted
as soon as we receive your donation.

107
00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:26.916
I have it here.

108
00:10:29.708 --> 00:10:31.166
Where is your wife?

109
00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:53.583
Heavenly music. don't you think?

110
00:10:55.916 --> 00:10:57.750
They play like angels.

111
00:10:59.416 --> 00:11:01.375
And they're only seven years old.

112
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.458
This is being played by children?

113
00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:08.000
Honey. it's all set.

114
00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:12.833
I'd like to meet them.

115
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:15.875
Tin. Tina!

116
00:11:18.666 --> 00:11:19.791
Come down here.

117
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.750
They were abandoned outside our gates

118
00:11:23.541 --> 00:11:25.458
when they were a few weeks old.

119
00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:28.625
They're…

120
00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:31.875
special children.

121
00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.583
Sure. But Tin and Tina
aren't Spanish names. are they?

122
00:11:35.666 --> 00:11:36.625
No.

123
00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:38.666
They were named after San Augustine.

124
00:11:39.458 --> 00:11:40.875
the saint of our order.

125
00:11:51.583 --> 00:11:52.708
Children.

126
00:11:52.791 --> 00:11:56.833
This is Mister Adolfo and his wife.

127
00:11:57.375 --> 00:11:58.208
Lola.

128
00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:01.250
-Hello.
-Hello.

129
00:12:01.333 --> 00:12:02.541
Hello.

130
00:12:02.625 --> 00:12:04.208
You play the organ really well.

131
00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:06.458
We practice every day.

132
00:12:08.583 --> 00:12:11.708
The wrath of God!

133
00:12:12.916 --> 00:12:14.833
Children. it's just a storm.

134
00:12:14.916 --> 00:12:17.708
Lola. let's do what we came here for.

135
00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:20.416
Children. you can keep playing.

136
00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:25.333
Don't go. please.

137
00:12:25.416 --> 00:12:27.791
Yes. please. Stay with us.

138
00:12:27.875 --> 00:12:30.000
We can play lots of things.

139
00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:33.791
I'd love to.

140
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:37.000
But I can't.

141
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.500
Tin. don't be sad.

142
00:12:44.583 --> 00:12:46.958
I told you that nobody loves us.

143
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.625
Just a second.

144
00:12:55.083 --> 00:12:57.416
Lola. no. please.

145
00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.833
I know what you're thinking.
but they're too old.

146
00:13:00.916 --> 00:13:02.208
And a bit strange.

147
00:13:02.916 --> 00:13:05.250
These kids need love.

148
00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:07.458
And so do we.

149
00:13:09.458 --> 00:13:11.208
Let's give love to each other.

150
00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:14.041
Let's be a family.

151
00:13:16.916 --> 00:13:18.000
Are you sure?

152
00:13:31.791 --> 00:13:35.500
Terror in the supermarket
Horror in the grocery store…

153
00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:36.875
Do you like this music?

154
00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.333
It's satanic.

155
00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:42.083
Okay.

156
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:45.791
Why not sing a song for us?

157
00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:47.916
Yes. a song!

158
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.333
Which one shall we sing?

159
00:13:49.416 --> 00:13:52.000
Go on. I'm sure you know many.

160
00:13:55.875 --> 00:14:01.041
All together. cheerfully singing

161
00:14:01.125 --> 00:14:05.500
Glory and praise to our Lord

162
00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:08.208
Glory to the Father

163
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:10.666
Glory to the Son

164
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.833
Glory to the Spirit of Love

165
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.958
I'll praise the Lord…

166
00:14:19.041 --> 00:14:20.375
Very nice. kids.

167
00:14:21.333 --> 00:14:23.083
Very nice song.

168
00:14:34.458 --> 00:14:35.708
How is my boy?

169
00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:37.791
Look. kids.

170
00:14:38.583 --> 00:14:39.583
This is Kuki.

171
00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:42.166
Do you want to say hello?

172
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:45.833
Tina!

173
00:14:45.916 --> 00:14:47.583
-Kuki.
-Are you scared?

174
00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:49.833
Kuki. enough!

175
00:14:50.708 --> 00:14:52.250
Let's go. He's a good dog.

176
00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:55.375
His name is Kuki.
and you'll have to look after him.

177
00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:58.708
Enough. stop! It's all right.

178
00:15:03.583 --> 00:15:05.875
Look. Dad pilots one of those.

179
00:15:06.666 --> 00:15:07.833
-Really?
-Yes.

180
00:15:07.916 --> 00:15:09.166
How cool.

181
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.791
Have you seen God up in the sky?

182
00:15:12.875 --> 00:15:14.833
I haven't yet had the pleasure.

183
00:15:16.208 --> 00:15:17.833
The drive didn't take long. did it?

184
00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:20.041
Not at all. The convent is very close.

185
00:15:20.125 --> 00:15:21.541
How close?

186
00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:23.833
About 15 kilometers away. more or less.

187
00:15:23.916 --> 00:15:25.250
And walking?

188
00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:26.375
Walking?

189
00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:29.166
Through the woods.
that would be around six kilometers.

190
00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.791
But it would take a long time.
Why do you want to know?

191
00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:37.458
Come on.

192
00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:42.750
Wow.

193
00:15:43.291 --> 00:15:44.375
So cool.

194
00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:46.625
How cool.

195
00:15:46.708 --> 00:15:48.041
It's awesome.

196
00:15:49.375 --> 00:15:51.333
-Let's go look around!
-Okay.

197
00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:01.666
Feels like they're carrying
a dead body in here.

198
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:03.375
Honey.

199
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.250
It's been so long since I saw you smile.

200
00:16:14.416 --> 00:16:15.500
Kids?

201
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.916
Kids.

202
00:16:24.666 --> 00:16:25.625
Kids.

203
00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:28.791
Kids!

204
00:16:32.375 --> 00:16:33.583
What's wrong. Mommy?

205
00:16:35.833 --> 00:16:36.958
Nothing.

206
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.916
Mommy. did we do something wrong?

207
00:16:42.416 --> 00:16:43.250
No.

208
00:16:45.083 --> 00:16:47.041
It's just that this isn't your room.

209
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:49.875
It's at the end of the hallway.

210
00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.750
Come on. Tina! Let's go see it!

211
00:16:57.791 --> 00:17:00.416
And those ones?
Are they from another trip?

212
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.833
Those are from China. a country far away.
I can show you photos.

213
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.541
And that? Is it from another trip?

214
00:17:09.041 --> 00:17:13.333
Kids. that's a TV.
Haven't you seen one before?

215
00:17:17.166 --> 00:17:18.000
Okay.

216
00:17:19.583 --> 00:17:20.750
Dinner time.

217
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:23.500
Where are you going?

218
00:17:24.791 --> 00:17:27.166
-It may not be any good.
-It'll be delicious.

219
00:17:28.416 --> 00:17:29.625
Let's see.

220
00:17:36.208 --> 00:17:40.208
We wanted to thank you
for adopting us as your children.

221
00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:42.458
Close your eyes.

222
00:17:43.625 --> 00:17:44.791
Okay.

223
00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.333
Open them.

224
00:17:53.541 --> 00:17:55.166
This is Christ's crown.

225
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.958
so that you can free us
from the curse of sin.

226
00:17:59.875 --> 00:18:00.708
Thank you.

227
00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:03.833
Now you. Mommy. Close your eyes.

228
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.791
Okay.

229
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.458
Let me put this on you.

230
00:18:12.708 --> 00:18:13.541
Open them.

231
00:18:15.208 --> 00:18:17.458
This is the Holy Rosary.

232
00:18:17.541 --> 00:18:21.458
so that. like Mary. you can meditate
on the mysteries of our faith.

233
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.791
If you wear it.
it'll protect you from evil.

234
00:18:25.875 --> 00:18:27.541
Come on. the king is hungry.

235
00:18:39.625 --> 00:18:41.791
How I've missed your omelets. honey.

236
00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:46.125
Eat. It'll get cold.

237
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.333
Kids?

238
00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:57.833
-What's wrong?
-You didn't say grace.

239
00:18:59.375 --> 00:19:01.291
How could I forget?

240
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.000
Okay. Let's say grace.

241
00:19:15.583 --> 00:19:19.250
O Lord. we give you thanks
for this day. for this food.

242
00:19:20.916 --> 00:19:25.500
May this food allow us to carry out
your Will. For Christ. our Lord. Amen.

243
00:19:25.583 --> 00:19:27.041
-Amen.
-Amen.

244
00:19:30.333 --> 00:19:32.000
Now we can eat. Bon appétit.

245
00:19:34.708 --> 00:19:35.625
It's delicious.

246
00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:46.625
Mommy?

247
00:19:46.708 --> 00:19:47.541
Yes?

248
00:19:48.083 --> 00:19:49.875
Why did you adopt us?

249
00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:53.708
Because we wanted to.

250
00:19:53.791 --> 00:19:55.291
Yeah. but.

251
00:19:55.833 --> 00:19:58.208
why don't you have children of your own?

252
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:02.708
Because it's impossible.

253
00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:08.291
Anything's possible. Mommy.
Miracles do happen.

254
00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:17.708
Why did you bring all these?

255
00:20:18.416 --> 00:20:22.375
So that the exterminating angel
can't come into this house.

256
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.375
The exterminating angel?

257
00:21:45.583 --> 00:21:46.958
Good morning. Mommy.

258
00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:49.166
Good morning. Mommy.

259
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.166
Good morning.

260
00:21:50.833 --> 00:21:51.958
You can start.

261
00:21:58.708 --> 00:22:00.291
Should we wait for Dad?

262
00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:03.750
No. Dad woke up very early to get to work.

263
00:22:05.583 --> 00:22:07.000
Come on. eat your breakfast.

264
00:22:16.916 --> 00:22:18.958
You didn't say grace.

265
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:22.958
I'm not going to.

266
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:25.416
You don't believe in God. right?

267
00:22:33.916 --> 00:22:35.375
Sometimes. it's hard to believe.

268
00:22:37.291 --> 00:22:41.833
"The fool says in his heart.
'There is no God.'"

269
00:22:42.458 --> 00:22:43.583
I know that one!

270
00:22:43.666 --> 00:22:45.916
Psalm…

271
00:22:46.791 --> 00:22:47.666
nine?

272
00:22:48.208 --> 00:22:50.708
-Psalm 14. silly.
-Shoot.

273
00:22:52.833 --> 00:22:55.375
We have a way of seeing God.

274
00:22:55.458 --> 00:22:56.666
Do you want to know how?

275
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:58.583
Sure.

276
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.791
You have to promise that.

277
00:23:00.875 --> 00:23:04.291
whatever happens.
you won't get up from your seat.

278
00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:06.291
Do you promise?

279
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:09.000
I promise.

280
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.166
I want to see God.

281
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:16.166
I want to ask Him for something. Please.

282
00:23:17.416 --> 00:23:18.500
Okay.

283
00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:37.166
Tina. what are you doing?

284
00:23:39.708 --> 00:23:41.041
You promised.

285
00:23:55.666 --> 00:23:56.583
Are you okay?

286
00:23:57.125 --> 00:23:59.500
I asked Him for a miracle for you.

287
00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:01.666
He'll grant it for sure.

288
00:24:05.625 --> 00:24:09.000
"Praise the Lord and be hopeful."

289
00:24:09.083 --> 00:24:12.541
"And if you have faith.
you will receive it."

290
00:24:12.625 --> 00:24:13.750
I know that one.

291
00:24:14.291 --> 00:24:16.500
Matthew--

292
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.958
-Take this!
-Kids. you can't do that.

293
00:24:23.041 --> 00:24:24.291
Stop it!

294
00:24:24.875 --> 00:24:26.125
Gross!

295
00:24:34.125 --> 00:24:35.875
Who did that?

296
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.250
EL POZÓN SCHOOL

297
00:24:46.333 --> 00:24:49.333
As you can see. inside the rib cage.

298
00:24:49.416 --> 00:24:52.125
we see the two lungs

299
00:24:52.208 --> 00:24:55.166
that contract and expand when we breathe.

300
00:24:55.708 --> 00:24:57.083
If we take them out.

301
00:24:57.166 --> 00:25:02.291
we can see the most important organ
in the human body. the--

302
00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:03.208
The weenie!

303
00:25:05.208 --> 00:25:07.041
Kids. please.

304
00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:08.625
Pedrito.

305
00:25:08.708 --> 00:25:09.833
listen to me.

306
00:25:10.875 --> 00:25:13.791
One more joke. and you're out.

307
00:25:13.875 --> 00:25:15.583
I promise. Mister Julián.

308
00:25:16.125 --> 00:25:17.500
No more jokes.

309
00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:28.125
Morning. Mister Julián.

310
00:25:28.208 --> 00:25:30.125
Good morning. Come in.

311
00:25:30.666 --> 00:25:34.708
Kids. for God's sake. settle down.

312
00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:37.333
Today. we have two new pupils joining us.

313
00:25:38.708 --> 00:25:42.208
He's Tin. and she's Tina.

314
00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.958
Hey. I know you.

315
00:25:51.208 --> 00:25:54.708
You're the children of Count Dracula.

316
00:25:56.791 --> 00:25:59.416
Pedrito! Quiet. kids. Quiet!

317
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.708
THE HOLY TRINITY

318
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.166
You're very good at it. Mommy.

319
00:26:10.208 --> 00:26:12.958
Okay. your turn. But be careful.

320
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.333
Here.

321
00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:25.083
Hey. you're not bad at all.

322
00:26:26.958 --> 00:26:30.458
Mommy. are we the children of Dracula?

323
00:26:31.458 --> 00:26:32.875
Do you know who Dracula is?

324
00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:36.000
Why aren't we like everyone else?

325
00:26:36.541 --> 00:26:38.625
Why did God make us so strange?

326
00:26:42.625 --> 00:26:44.125
You wanna know a secret?

327
00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:45.625
Okay.

328
00:26:55.125 --> 00:26:57.416
You've got a fake leg.

329
00:27:00.708 --> 00:27:02.000
See. I'm strange too.

330
00:27:03.791 --> 00:27:05.000
What happened to you?

331
00:27:08.916 --> 00:27:10.500
When I was your age…

332
00:27:13.208 --> 00:27:15.208
my parents used to go from town to town

333
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.541
screening movies.

334
00:27:19.125 --> 00:27:20.875
We lived in a caravan.

335
00:27:26.416 --> 00:27:27.375
One night.

336
00:27:28.625 --> 00:27:31.041
I woke up and my leg was on fire.

337
00:27:35.083 --> 00:27:37.041
There was fire everywhere.

338
00:27:41.458 --> 00:27:43.958
I managed to escape and survive.

339
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.083
But my parents didn't.

340
00:27:51.083 --> 00:27:52.291
It was God. Mommy.

341
00:27:52.833 --> 00:27:53.875
God saved you.

342
00:27:54.791 --> 00:27:56.083
Anyone home?

343
00:27:56.166 --> 00:27:58.375
-Daddy!
-Daddy!

344
00:28:38.541 --> 00:28:41.208
Did you nail
all those crucifixes over the doors?

345
00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:43.708
I thought you did it.

346
00:28:44.833 --> 00:28:46.833
-It was the children.
-It doesn't matter.

347
00:28:47.375 --> 00:28:49.500
If it's important to them.
just leave them.

348
00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:52.125
They're obsessed with religion.

349
00:28:52.875 --> 00:28:55.541
-They spend all day talking about God.
-It's normal.

350
00:28:56.375 --> 00:28:57.666
They were raised by nuns.

351
00:28:58.208 --> 00:29:00.291
It'd be strange if they talked sports.

352
00:29:01.125 --> 00:29:01.958
Fine.

353
00:29:12.208 --> 00:29:14.000
Do you think God exists?

354
00:29:14.916 --> 00:29:15.750
I mean for real?

355
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.250
I think there are two possibilities.

356
00:29:23.791 --> 00:29:28.666
Either there's an omnipotent
and mysterious God

357
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.875
that'll allow us
to see each other in our next life. or--

358
00:29:31.958 --> 00:29:33.333
Or God doesn't exist.

359
00:29:34.583 --> 00:29:37.541
And we made it all up
so we wouldn't feel so alone.

360
00:29:41.083 --> 00:29:42.291
And nothing makes sense.

361
00:29:46.458 --> 00:29:48.125
That's why I think…

362
00:29:50.583 --> 00:29:52.416
we shouldn't leave for our next life

363
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.083
what we can enjoy in this one.

364
00:29:56.625 --> 00:29:59.041
Hey. stop. The kids might see.

365
00:30:00.166 --> 00:30:02.125
You're starting to act like a mom.

366
00:30:02.208 --> 00:30:03.375
You're an idiot.

367
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.625
Hey!

368
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.958
Why are you still awake?

369
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.125
We aren't sleepy.

370
00:30:26.166 --> 00:30:28.083
Can we play Battle of the Angels?

371
00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:31.250
Yeah. let's play Battle of the Angels.
then we'll go to sleep.

372
00:30:32.041 --> 00:30:34.791
Please.

373
00:30:35.958 --> 00:30:36.791
Okay.

374
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.708
How do you play it?

375
00:30:38.791 --> 00:30:39.833
It's very easy.

376
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.750
You close your eyes.
and we recite a Bible verse.

377
00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:45.500
When we finish.

378
00:30:46.041 --> 00:30:49.333
you count to three.
open your eyes. and look for us.

379
00:30:50.083 --> 00:30:51.000
And that's it?

380
00:30:53.416 --> 00:30:54.875
And what do I have to do?

381
00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:56.208
Stand up.

382
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.833
Revelation 12:7-9.

383
00:31:05.916 --> 00:31:08.208
"War broke out in heaven."

384
00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:12.375
"Michael and his angels fought
against the great dragon."

385
00:31:12.458 --> 00:31:16.041
"The great dragon. that ancient serpent

386
00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:19.125
called the Devil. or Satan.

387
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.416
who leads the whole world astray."

388
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.875
I'm coming.

389
00:31:30.875 --> 00:31:31.833
One…

390
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:35.291
two…

391
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
And three!

392
00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:40.083
-Get out of here. Satan!
-Out. Satan!

393
00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:16.625
Kids. Another game?

394
00:32:17.666 --> 00:32:18.916
Come on. where are you?

395
00:32:20.833 --> 00:32:22.333
Where are you. kids?

396
00:32:28.916 --> 00:32:30.916
Come on Tin. hold it tight!

397
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.625
Mommy. ask Him for something.

398
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.541
I told you to hold on tight!

399
00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:51.041
Mommy. you can almost see Him!

400
00:32:52.125 --> 00:32:53.125
There He is.

401
00:32:53.791 --> 00:32:55.500
There He is. Mommy.

402
00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:32.125
Feeling better?

403
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:33.583
Yes.

404
00:33:34.916 --> 00:33:36.250
Lola.

405
00:33:36.333 --> 00:33:40.125
I can get my belt. beat them.
and this nonsense will be over.

406
00:33:40.208 --> 00:33:41.333
They're just children.

407
00:33:42.958 --> 00:33:45.166
They like to play. like all children.

408
00:33:48.083 --> 00:33:50.625
They just need some time to adjust.

409
00:33:51.625 --> 00:33:53.041
Tin and Tina!

410
00:34:02.791 --> 00:34:03.833
Calm down.

411
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.333
We're very sorry. Mommy.

412
00:34:16.416 --> 00:34:19.166
If we've been bad to you.

413
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:21.000
we deserve to be punished.

414
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.416
Kuki. stop!

415
00:34:29.958 --> 00:34:32.541
They used to beat us
with sticks in the convent.

416
00:34:33.083 --> 00:34:36.375
Once. when we committed a very big sin.

417
00:34:37.458 --> 00:34:39.250
they cut off our hair.

418
00:34:41.208 --> 00:34:44.375
There's no salvation without punishment.

419
00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:47.000
We won't punish you.

420
00:34:48.083 --> 00:34:49.125
Kuki!

421
00:34:56.625 --> 00:34:58.083
Are you okay. Mommy?

422
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.875
First. you go backward.

423
00:35:14.958 --> 00:35:17.791
and then. when you let go.
you put your feet up.

424
00:35:17.875 --> 00:35:19.125
Look. just like this.

425
00:35:21.625 --> 00:35:23.291
Come on. it's so easy.

426
00:35:25.666 --> 00:35:27.208
Don't be a chicken.

427
00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.750
I'm not a chicken.

428
00:35:28.833 --> 00:35:29.750
Do it. then.

429
00:35:30.291 --> 00:35:34.458
My old friends. the little Draculas.

430
00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:38.083
Wow. Nice hats.

431
00:35:38.666 --> 00:35:41.541
They probably match
the coffins you sleep in.

432
00:35:44.125 --> 00:35:46.875
We don't sleep in coffins. That's a lie.

433
00:35:46.958 --> 00:35:47.875
Are you sure?

434
00:35:51.541 --> 00:35:54.208
What are you doing? What--

435
00:35:54.291 --> 00:35:56.416
What are you gonna do? No!

436
00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.958
-No. please! Don't!
-No! Don't do that to him.

437
00:36:00.041 --> 00:36:01.000
-No!
-Let go of me!

438
00:36:01.083 --> 00:36:03.791
Fly. little Dracula. Fly!

439
00:36:03.875 --> 00:36:05.958
No. stop!

440
00:36:06.041 --> 00:36:08.500
-Fly!
-No! Stop!

441
00:36:12.291 --> 00:36:15.875
MY FAVORITE HORRORS

442
00:36:15.958 --> 00:36:19.750
Legends say he used to drink
the blood of his victims.

443
00:36:19.833 --> 00:36:22.000
that's why people called him "Dracul."

444
00:36:22.083 --> 00:36:25.250
which means dragon or devil.

445
00:36:25.333 --> 00:36:27.291
or more specifically. son of the Devil.

446
00:36:27.375 --> 00:36:31.375
And from that Dracul.
Bram Stoker created Dracula.

447
00:36:31.458 --> 00:36:32.333
Daddy?

448
00:36:32.416 --> 00:36:33.250
That's me.

449
00:36:34.916 --> 00:36:37.083
-Can we watch the movie. please?
-No.

450
00:36:37.166 --> 00:36:38.625
We can't. it's a scary movie.

451
00:36:38.708 --> 00:36:41.208
What do you mean?
Of course they can. sweetie.

452
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:45.208
We're very tired.
so we're going to bed now.

453
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.875
Have lots of fun. Good night.

454
00:36:48.583 --> 00:36:50.583
-Good night.
-Good night.

455
00:36:50.666 --> 00:36:51.833
Good night.

456
00:36:51.916 --> 00:36:55.166
…vampirism offers
the secret to eternal life.

457
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:57.125
Forget symbolism…

458
00:36:57.208 --> 00:36:58.583
This is cool. Tin.

459
00:36:58.666 --> 00:37:00.291
…and don't miss the end.

460
00:37:09.208 --> 00:37:11.125
Turn down the volume. please.

461
00:37:31.083 --> 00:37:33.875
Rock. paper. scissors.

462
00:37:36.791 --> 00:37:37.916
Your turn.

463
00:37:55.583 --> 00:37:58.916
Holy Mary. Mother of God.

464
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.583
pray for us sinners.

465
00:38:01.666 --> 00:38:04.583
now and at the hour of our death.

466
00:38:04.666 --> 00:38:05.500
Amen.

467
00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:27.250
Should I add more?

468
00:38:27.333 --> 00:38:29.708
Yes. He'll sleep better.

469
00:38:32.208 --> 00:38:33.250
Your turn.

470
00:38:46.541 --> 00:38:48.375
Quick. Tin. They'll see us.

471
00:38:52.041 --> 00:38:52.916
Coward.

472
00:39:00.708 --> 00:39:01.958
Here. boy.

473
00:39:05.958 --> 00:39:07.541
Here's your dinner.

474
00:39:18.166 --> 00:39:19.708
I can't.

475
00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:21.208
A bit more.

476
00:39:30.375 --> 00:39:31.916
Here.

477
00:39:46.416 --> 00:39:47.416
Come on. Tin.

478
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.208
We don't have much time.

479
00:40:03.125 --> 00:40:03.958
This one.

480
00:40:05.291 --> 00:40:06.833
That one's too small.

481
00:40:06.916 --> 00:40:08.750
Take…

482
00:40:09.416 --> 00:40:10.416
this one.

483
00:40:10.958 --> 00:40:13.000
But I like this one better.

484
00:40:15.916 --> 00:40:17.291
Take this.

485
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.250
And…

486
00:40:19.791 --> 00:40:21.250
take this one too.

487
00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:41.500
Did you do it yet?

488
00:40:42.375 --> 00:40:44.166
No. I'm scared.

489
00:40:47.083 --> 00:40:50.375
Look. You have to do it right here.

490
00:40:50.458 --> 00:40:51.500
I can't.

491
00:40:52.333 --> 00:40:54.083
Hard. Tin. Do it hard.

492
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.125
Your face is covered in blood.

493
00:41:07.083 --> 00:41:08.541
You look like a vampire.

494
00:41:08.625 --> 00:41:12.125
And you look like a clown.

495
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:15.208
Take this.

496
00:41:15.958 --> 00:41:17.041
You'll see.

497
00:41:20.666 --> 00:41:22.375
Come on. Tin. Stop.

498
00:41:23.833 --> 00:41:25.000
I'll help you.

499
00:41:25.625 --> 00:41:27.333
It's like cutting up a steak.

500
00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:29.583
Like this.

501
00:41:30.583 --> 00:41:32.791
Now stick your hand in and take it out.

502
00:41:36.875 --> 00:41:38.041
What's it like?

503
00:41:39.208 --> 00:41:41.833
It's soft.

504
00:41:41.916 --> 00:41:43.416
Like a sponge?

505
00:41:44.416 --> 00:41:47.833
No. It's soft…

506
00:41:47.916 --> 00:41:49.000
like a snail.

507
00:41:49.541 --> 00:41:52.625
Like a snail? You're so dumb.

508
00:41:59.291 --> 00:42:02.208
Psalm 51:1-2.

509
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.833
"Have mercy on me. O God.

510
00:42:05.916 --> 00:42:07.666
according to your unfailing love.

511
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:09.500
according to your great compassion.

512
00:42:10.041 --> 00:42:12.083
blot out my transgressions."

513
00:42:12.166 --> 00:42:14.416
"Wash away all my iniquity.

514
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.416
and cleanse me from my sin."

515
00:42:18.875 --> 00:42:20.083
Put it back in.

516
00:42:21.416 --> 00:42:23.083
Careful.

517
00:42:39.375 --> 00:42:41.625
-You're good at sewing.
-Thanks.

518
00:42:46.958 --> 00:42:50.166
You'll see how happy Mom will be
when she wakes up.

519
00:42:52.541 --> 00:42:55.125
Done. Now we have to wait.

520
00:42:55.791 --> 00:42:58.833
Waiting is boring.
What can we do in the meantime?

521
00:42:59.916 --> 00:43:01.333
Well.

522
00:43:01.416 --> 00:43:03.750
we can watch TV like everyone else.

523
00:43:08.791 --> 00:43:10.583
Today. people believe in nothing.

524
00:43:11.125 --> 00:43:13.250
They don't even believe in magicians.

525
00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:17.250
I'll give you
a few minutes to think about it.

526
00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:18.791
I'll be right back.

527
00:43:19.625 --> 00:43:20.833
TONIGHT

528
00:43:39.041 --> 00:43:40.250
What's wrong. honey?

529
00:43:40.333 --> 00:43:41.208
Nothing.

530
00:43:41.958 --> 00:43:45.000
The kids have been playing with jam again.

531
00:43:47.416 --> 00:43:48.916
That's not jam.

532
00:43:52.041 --> 00:43:53.791
He isn't waking up.

533
00:44:12.666 --> 00:44:13.833
What have you done?

534
00:44:14.625 --> 00:44:19.291
Kuki was bad to Mom. so we cleaned him.

535
00:44:19.375 --> 00:44:20.583
What did you clean?

536
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.541
His soul.

537
00:44:24.208 --> 00:44:26.083
We cleaned his soul.

538
00:44:26.833 --> 00:44:28.916
We wanted to honor you. Mom.

539
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.666
so that you'd be proud of us.

540
00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:36.375
Why won't he wake up?

541
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:39.291
Because he's dead.

542
00:44:42.041 --> 00:44:43.291
Dead?

543
00:44:43.375 --> 00:44:45.625
Did we kill him?

544
00:44:47.375 --> 00:44:51.625
-No. no.
-No. no.

545
00:44:51.708 --> 00:44:52.750
No!

546
00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:00.166
It's all right.

547
00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:03.458
It was an accident.

548
00:45:44.583 --> 00:45:45.625
It still stinks.

549
00:46:05.625 --> 00:46:06.583
Do you feel better?

550
00:46:07.833 --> 00:46:10.875
What if they cut
you or me open to clean our souls?

551
00:46:11.791 --> 00:46:12.625
Lola.

552
00:46:13.625 --> 00:46:14.958
It was a misunderstanding.

553
00:46:15.625 --> 00:46:18.416
A tragic one.
but a misunderstanding nonetheless.

554
00:46:20.083 --> 00:46:22.625
These kids
have such an innocent perspective.

555
00:46:24.333 --> 00:46:25.791
Do you know what they need?

556
00:46:27.125 --> 00:46:31.500
A mom to teach them right from wrong.

557
00:46:40.875 --> 00:46:45.333
In the name of the Father.
the Son. and the Holy Spirit.

558
00:46:45.875 --> 00:46:46.708
Amen.

559
00:47:57.958 --> 00:47:58.916
Tin!

560
00:47:59.875 --> 00:48:01.000
Tin. what's wrong?

561
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:02.666
Are you all right?

562
00:48:04.666 --> 00:48:05.500
What's going on?

563
00:48:06.041 --> 00:48:07.166
Fire.

564
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:09.291
The eternal fire.

565
00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:11.375
What's this?

566
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.250
I don't want
any more penitence in this house.

567
00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:24.208
Do you understand?

568
00:48:24.291 --> 00:48:28.333
Mommy. if we pray a lot.
will Kuki come back to life?

569
00:48:28.416 --> 00:48:29.750
No. he won't.

570
00:48:30.291 --> 00:48:32.208
-But the Bible says--
-Enough!

571
00:48:34.083 --> 00:48:35.291
Listen to me.

572
00:48:36.416 --> 00:48:37.625
This is very important.

573
00:48:38.291 --> 00:48:40.541
You can't do just as the Bible says.

574
00:48:42.541 --> 00:48:45.458
Why not? It's God's word.

575
00:48:45.541 --> 00:48:48.708
Yeah. but you can't take it literally.

576
00:48:50.375 --> 00:48:52.916
You've read fairy tales in school. right?

577
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.125
Yes.

578
00:48:55.208 --> 00:48:58.041
They're stories of witches.

579
00:48:58.125 --> 00:49:01.166
red riding hoods.
wolves. and talking pigs.

580
00:49:01.708 --> 00:49:03.166
But animals can't speak.

581
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:04.916
Of course they can't.

582
00:49:05.916 --> 00:49:07.416
Because it's fantasy.

583
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:10.875
It's an imaginary world
that doesn't exist.

584
00:49:11.625 --> 00:49:13.000
The Bible is fantasy.

585
00:49:14.333 --> 00:49:17.625
There aren't any angels.
devils. Heaven. or Hell.

586
00:49:18.208 --> 00:49:20.291
I think they do exist.

587
00:49:20.375 --> 00:49:21.833
I think so too.

588
00:49:23.541 --> 00:49:26.666
And someday. you'll believe as well.

589
00:49:45.416 --> 00:49:46.541
What's so funny?

590
00:49:47.625 --> 00:49:49.208
Daddy!

591
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:50.583
Come here!

592
00:49:52.291 --> 00:49:53.208
Hey.

593
00:49:54.416 --> 00:49:57.166
Do you know who I saw
from the plane on Christmas Eve?

594
00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.208
God?

595
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:00.583
No. Santa Claus.

596
00:50:01.416 --> 00:50:03.583
On his sleigh. You know what he told me?

597
00:50:04.166 --> 00:50:06.583
"Ho. ho. ho. Merry Christmas. Adolfo."

598
00:50:06.666 --> 00:50:09.791
"I've got a present for your kids."

599
00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.291
-How cool.
-Wow!

600
00:50:14.375 --> 00:50:15.875
And he gave me this too.

601
00:50:15.958 --> 00:50:17.125
ENRIQUE AND ANA

602
00:50:17.208 --> 00:50:20.708
"Chinese spinning plate."

603
00:50:27.916 --> 00:50:29.916
I almost didn't make it because of snow.

604
00:50:30.458 --> 00:50:31.666
I'm really busy.

605
00:50:33.541 --> 00:50:34.458
Feeling okay?

606
00:50:35.083 --> 00:50:35.916
Yeah.

607
00:50:36.875 --> 00:50:38.375
-I'll get changed.
-Okay.

608
00:50:45.625 --> 00:50:48.916
It's one of the top hits of 1981.

609
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.500
I'm sure you all know
what song I'm talking about. right?

610
00:50:52.583 --> 00:50:54.416
Are you ready? Let's dance.

611
00:50:57.416 --> 00:51:00.375
Little birds. let's dance
When you are just born…

612
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.166
Somebody's tired.

613
00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:10.375
How much longer 'til midnight?

614
00:51:10.458 --> 00:51:11.833
It won't be long. Look.

615
00:51:12.625 --> 00:51:15.083
When both clock hands overlap here. okay?

616
00:51:16.541 --> 00:51:21.541
Seven. eight. nine.

617
00:51:21.625 --> 00:51:23.583
Mommy. the coffee's ready.

618
00:51:26.208 --> 00:51:30.250
Ten. eleven. twelve.

619
00:51:30.916 --> 00:51:33.041
Finished. What can I do now?

620
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.875
If you want.
you can sprinkle some sugar on the cake.

621
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.166
It's in the cupboard.

622
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.208
No. not that one!

623
00:51:49.291 --> 00:51:50.333
What's wrong. Mommy?

624
00:51:50.416 --> 00:51:52.083
That's for killing bugs.

625
00:51:52.875 --> 00:51:54.416
I don't know why it's here.

626
00:51:54.958 --> 00:51:56.166
This is the sugar.

627
00:51:59.708 --> 00:52:01.625
Our cameras are bringing you…

628
00:52:01.708 --> 00:52:03.250
The grapes are ready.

629
00:52:03.333 --> 00:52:06.208
Great. sweetie. Thanks.

630
00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:07.166
You're welcome.

631
00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:10.083
You remember what I said?

632
00:52:10.625 --> 00:52:11.625
No.

633
00:52:11.708 --> 00:52:13.625
What do you mean no? Do you remember?

634
00:52:13.708 --> 00:52:15.541
-No.
-You don't?

635
00:52:18.041 --> 00:52:19.333
The coffee is ready.

636
00:52:19.416 --> 00:52:21.666
Perfect. Make some room for Mom.

637
00:52:22.708 --> 00:52:23.625
Let's go over it.

638
00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:26.208
First. what happens? We see…

639
00:52:26.291 --> 00:52:27.375
The bell.

640
00:52:27.458 --> 00:52:28.583
Not the bell.

641
00:52:28.666 --> 00:52:30.041
-What comes down?
-The ball.

642
00:52:30.125 --> 00:52:32.458
-And what rings?
-The bell.

643
00:52:32.541 --> 00:52:34.083
-And for every ring…
-A grape!

644
00:52:34.166 --> 00:52:35.833
You got it. Good.

645
00:52:37.708 --> 00:52:39.333
-Mommy!
-Lola.

646
00:52:39.416 --> 00:52:40.666
Mommy?

647
00:52:41.458 --> 00:52:43.541
Lola!

648
00:52:43.625 --> 00:52:48.875
EMERGENCY

649
00:52:54.375 --> 00:52:55.583
María de los Dolores?

650
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.208
I've got your test results.

651
00:53:00.208 --> 00:53:02.875
Your New Year's Eve
was interrupted for a good reason.

652
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:05.541
I don't understand.

653
00:53:07.166 --> 00:53:08.625
You're pregnant.

654
00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:16.416
But that's impossible.

655
00:53:17.833 --> 00:53:19.000
Consider it a miracle.

656
00:53:24.541 --> 00:53:25.791
Happy New Year.

657
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:39.333
A great magician from the East
Kin Khan Kun the soothsayer

658
00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:42.833
Showed me his secret
The Chinese spinning plate

659
00:53:42.916 --> 00:53:46.041
What is that shiny thing
At the top of the stick?

660
00:53:46.125 --> 00:53:49.583
Is it a bird. a plane
A satellite. or a flying saucer?

661
00:53:49.666 --> 00:53:53.041
What is that thing
That spins like a windmill blade?

662
00:53:53.125 --> 00:53:56.708
It's a plate. that's great
It's the Chinese spinning plate

663
00:53:56.791 --> 00:54:00.166
Chinese spinning plate

664
00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:02.916
Thin. Filipino

665
00:54:03.791 --> 00:54:07.041
Chinese spinning plate

666
00:54:07.125 --> 00:54:09.916
Thin. Filipino

667
00:54:11.416 --> 00:54:13.791
Good. That was great.

668
00:54:13.875 --> 00:54:15.291
Did you like it. Mommy?

669
00:54:15.916 --> 00:54:16.875
Very much.

670
00:54:16.958 --> 00:54:18.416
And our brother?

671
00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:19.666
Let's see. hold on.

672
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.291
He loved it.

673
00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.750
Okay. off to bed.
You need rest for tomorrow.

674
00:54:26.833 --> 00:54:28.041
You believe in God now?

675
00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:31.166
Why do you think that?

676
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:34.375
Because our brother
will be born thanks to a miracle.

677
00:54:34.458 --> 00:54:37.708
It's true. I asked Him and He granted it.

678
00:54:37.791 --> 00:54:39.583
Miracles don't happen.

679
00:54:40.541 --> 00:54:42.458
Everything in life has an explanation.

680
00:54:44.125 --> 00:54:46.291
-You fail to see.
-What don't I see?

681
00:54:46.375 --> 00:54:50.791
When Jesus was born. his mother.
the Virgin Mary. suffered a lot

682
00:54:50.875 --> 00:54:54.750
because she already knew
that her son would die to save us all.

683
00:54:54.833 --> 00:54:56.125
Sacrifice.

684
00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:00.916
What if God wanted to sacrifice
our brother to save us?

685
00:55:01.458 --> 00:55:05.208
That'd be a shame.
I don't want him to die. Right. Mommy?

686
00:55:14.916 --> 00:55:19.333
…I will praise the Lord

687
00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:23.666
I will praise

688
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:28.041
I will praise the Lord

689
00:55:28.583 --> 00:55:32.583
John saw the number of those redeemed

690
00:55:32.666 --> 00:55:36.750
And they all praised the Lord

691
00:55:37.291 --> 00:55:39.416
Some were singing…

692
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.333
Little Draculas.

693
00:55:41.416 --> 00:55:43.000
Are you nervous?

694
00:55:43.875 --> 00:55:46.375
You're receiving Jesus Christ today.

695
00:55:47.291 --> 00:55:53.833
Although you'd probably
rather receive the stupid Holy Spirit.

696
00:55:53.916 --> 00:55:57.375
He blasphemed. Tina!
The unforgivable blasphemy.

697
00:55:57.458 --> 00:55:59.500
Don't worry. Tin. Don't worry.

698
00:55:59.583 --> 00:56:01.500
God will make things right.

699
00:56:04.875 --> 00:56:11.583
Hail Mary. full of grace

700
00:56:13.791 --> 00:56:17.583
The Lord is with thee

701
00:56:17.666 --> 00:56:23.833
Blessed art thou amongst women

702
00:56:23.916 --> 00:56:25.625
I don't see the kids.

703
00:56:25.708 --> 00:56:32.708
And blessed is the fruit
Of thy womb. Jesus

704
00:56:34.833 --> 00:56:41.416
Holy Mary. Mother of God

705
00:56:42.291 --> 00:56:46.750
Pray for us sinners

706
00:56:46.833 --> 00:56:53.833
Now and at the hour of our death

707
00:56:54.875 --> 00:56:56.875
Amen

708
00:56:57.791 --> 00:57:00.708
Thank you so much
to our children in the choir.

709
00:57:00.791 --> 00:57:03.416
And also to our brother and sister.
Tin and Tina.

710
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.875
who played the organ.

711
00:57:12.375 --> 00:57:14.375
Take and eat.

712
00:57:14.458 --> 00:57:17.458
This is the body of Christ.
which will give you eternal life.

713
00:57:17.541 --> 00:57:18.583
Amen.

714
00:57:22.083 --> 00:57:23.541
Take and eat.

715
00:57:23.625 --> 00:57:27.041
This is the body of Christ.
which will give you eternal life.

716
00:57:27.125 --> 00:57:28.000
Amen.

717
00:57:30.166 --> 00:57:32.000
Take and eat.

718
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:36.541
This is the body of Christ.
which will give you eternal life.

719
00:57:36.625 --> 00:57:37.458
Amen.

720
00:57:39.916 --> 00:57:41.500
Take and eat.

721
00:57:42.166 --> 00:57:46.250
This is the body of Christ.
which will give you eternal life.

722
00:57:46.333 --> 00:57:47.166
Amen.

723
00:58:08.791 --> 00:58:12.125
Come on. Let's go together.

724
00:58:12.208 --> 00:58:13.166
Come on.

725
00:58:16.958 --> 00:58:18.666
Good night. Mommy.

726
00:58:19.208 --> 00:58:20.666
Good night.

727
00:58:24.166 --> 00:58:26.375
Was that the boy
who bullies you at school?

728
00:58:27.333 --> 00:58:29.125
He calls us little Draculas.

729
00:58:30.041 --> 00:58:32.208
Were you involved in what happened to him?

730
00:58:35.458 --> 00:58:36.875
You can't lie to me.

731
00:58:38.625 --> 00:58:39.833
Lying is a sin.

732
00:58:43.333 --> 00:58:45.416
Don't worry. Mommy.

733
00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:47.541
We'll pray for him.

734
00:58:50.541 --> 00:58:52.041
Good night. children.

735
00:59:26.333 --> 00:59:27.166
Hello?

736
00:59:27.708 --> 00:59:28.750
Hello.

737
00:59:28.833 --> 00:59:32.083
The school gave me your number.
I'm sorry to bother you.

738
00:59:32.166 --> 00:59:33.333
No. it's no bother.

739
00:59:34.125 --> 00:59:36.750
You were at Communion
the other day. right?

740
00:59:36.833 --> 00:59:37.666
Yes.

741
00:59:38.333 --> 00:59:39.791
I'm Pedro's mother.

742
00:59:40.625 --> 00:59:42.500
The boy that had the accident.

743
00:59:42.583 --> 00:59:43.708
How is he doing?

744
00:59:45.458 --> 00:59:46.291
It's bad.

745
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.041
He's in a coma.

746
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.333
I'm so sorry.

747
00:59:52.458 --> 00:59:54.916
Some of the children have said

748
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.791
they saw Pedro
staying behind with your kids.

749
00:59:58.875 --> 01:00:00.041
The Civil Guard said--

750
01:00:00.125 --> 01:00:02.833
Yeah. The Civil Guard says he slipped

751
01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:05.000
and fell off the rocks.

752
01:00:05.083 --> 01:00:08.875
But I don't know. I have a feeling
that's not what happened.

753
01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:11.708
My son's no saint. you know?

754
01:00:11.791 --> 01:00:15.458
If he bullied your kids.
I'd understand if they'd…

755
01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:20.250
Sorry. I shouldn't have called.

756
01:00:21.083 --> 01:00:24.416
You can't imagine how hard it is to think

757
01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:27.916
your son. at any minute.

758
01:00:28.916 --> 01:00:29.750
could die.

759
01:00:29.833 --> 01:00:30.750
Mommy.

760
01:00:33.583 --> 01:00:34.666
Who was it?

761
01:00:36.041 --> 01:00:36.875
Nobody.

762
01:01:19.333 --> 01:01:22.208
SPARE THE ROD. SPOIL THE CHILD

763
01:01:22.291 --> 01:01:23.375
Lola.

764
01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:25.875
Lola?

765
01:01:25.958 --> 01:01:27.041
Yes?

766
01:01:29.291 --> 01:01:31.000
This might sound odd to you.

767
01:01:32.375 --> 01:01:33.791
but I need to know…

768
01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:40.166
if Tin and Tina ever got
into any kind of trouble with other kids.

769
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:42.000
No. never.

770
01:01:42.791 --> 01:01:44.125
Did they do something bad?

771
01:01:45.208 --> 01:01:46.250
I'm not sure.

772
01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:51.583
But they may have made a mistake
that'll have serious consequences.

773
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.833
Do you have any evidence
of their involvement?

774
01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:03.208
Are you sure
they never did anything violent?

775
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.833
Maybe something to do
with misinterpreting the Bible?

776
01:02:09.416 --> 01:02:11.166
John 10:14.

777
01:02:12.625 --> 01:02:14.291
"I am the good shepherd."

778
01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:16.666
"I know my sheep."

779
01:02:17.583 --> 01:02:21.958
"And I lay down my life for the sheep."

780
01:02:26.208 --> 01:02:29.791
Maybe your way of guiding the flock
is not the most appropriate one.

781
01:02:31.833 --> 01:02:33.541
"Spare the rod. spoil the child."

782
01:02:34.791 --> 01:02:36.708
Suffering is necessary.

783
01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:42.666
Nobody can seek Christ without suffering
the pain of bearing the same cross.

784
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:44.375
I'm just saying. Tin and Tina--

785
01:02:44.458 --> 01:02:47.833
Tin and Tina are two beings of light.

786
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.125
They're naughty. like all children.

787
01:02:51.708 --> 01:02:54.541
But they're pure. just. and righteous.

788
01:02:57.250 --> 01:02:59.166
They're not the problem.

789
01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:01.541
You are.

790
01:03:02.458 --> 01:03:04.416
Because you judge them without knowing.

791
01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:06.750
And that's a sin.

792
01:03:08.291 --> 01:03:10.125
You shouldn't imagine things.

793
01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:14.375
-I shouldn't have come.
-You're wrong.

794
01:03:15.916 --> 01:03:18.541
God brought you here for a good reason.

795
01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:21.666
Where's God

796
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:25.875
when he allows unborn babies to die?

797
01:03:26.708 --> 01:03:27.541
Where?

798
01:03:46.916 --> 01:03:48.458
God is here.

799
01:03:49.666 --> 01:03:51.916
Absence is presence.

800
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:54.583
That's the great mystery.

801
01:04:02.291 --> 01:04:03.375
I'm sorry.

802
01:04:09.333 --> 01:04:11.333
The dark night of the soul.

803
01:04:15.041 --> 01:04:17.083
You're lost in the darkness.

804
01:04:17.791 --> 01:04:18.791
Search.

805
01:04:18.875 --> 01:04:21.125
Keep searching.

806
01:04:22.583 --> 01:04:24.958
That's the only way to find the light.

807
01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:57.458
The wrath.

808
01:06:15.583 --> 01:06:17.791
MATTHEW 12

809
01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:23.041
SAMUEL 17

810
01:06:32.083 --> 01:06:33.791
The wrath of God.

811
01:07:41.583 --> 01:07:42.625
How was the flight?

812
01:07:44.291 --> 01:07:47.791
The flight? It was fine. as usual.
Why are you awake?

813
01:07:48.708 --> 01:07:49.791
You smell of alcohol.

814
01:07:50.916 --> 01:07:53.166
I had a couple of drinks
with my colleagues.

815
01:07:54.833 --> 01:07:56.916
Honey. I'm going to bed. I'm very tired.

816
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.208
Come down for a second.

817
01:07:59.541 --> 01:08:02.000
Lola. it's four in the morning.
What do you want?

818
01:08:02.083 --> 01:08:05.125
Can you come down here
for a second. please?

819
01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:07.833
Sure.

820
01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:18.083
What's wrong?

821
01:08:21.333 --> 01:08:23.333
The boy from the communion is in a coma.

822
01:08:26.875 --> 01:08:31.166
I think Tin and Tina are responsible.
and they're playing a monstrous game.

823
01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:37.583
I found this.
and I think we should call the police.

824
01:08:38.125 --> 01:08:39.291
This is evidence.

825
01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:40.416
What's this?

826
01:08:46.375 --> 01:08:48.666
For God's sake. Lola.
These are just drawings.

827
01:08:49.666 --> 01:08:51.250
And that boy bullied them.

828
01:08:51.791 --> 01:08:54.750
It's normal for them
to do things like that. or worse.

829
01:08:56.208 --> 01:08:59.458
What if they're not innocent kids
misinterpreting the Bible?

830
01:09:00.708 --> 01:09:02.458
What if they're the opposite?

831
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.500
What if they use the Bible

832
01:09:05.791 --> 01:09:08.916
to justify their terrible deeds?

833
01:09:11.333 --> 01:09:12.958
This is about the dog. isn't it?

834
01:09:13.791 --> 01:09:15.416
You'll never forgive them.

835
01:09:17.541 --> 01:09:20.666
A mother should
trust and protect her children.

836
01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:22.125
That's what I'm doing.

837
01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:25.666
I'm protecting our son.

838
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:26.916
This is nonsense.

839
01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:31.958
When that boy comes out of the coma.
he'll explain what happened.

840
01:09:32.666 --> 01:09:34.208
But now. I'm going to bed.

841
01:09:55.541 --> 01:09:56.791
Tina?

842
01:09:57.416 --> 01:09:58.250
Tina?

843
01:09:59.666 --> 01:10:01.166
Tina. wake up!

844
01:10:02.166 --> 01:10:03.541
What is it. Tin?

845
01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:05.416
The Bible!

846
01:10:06.708 --> 01:10:07.708
It's gone!

847
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.916
Tin. The crucifixes!

848
01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:24.416
Mommy!

849
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:27.833
The exterminating angel
took away the crucifixes

850
01:10:27.916 --> 01:10:29.625
and stole our…

851
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.125
When you're older. you may open the box.

852
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:44.541
But until then.
no more religion in this house.

853
01:10:47.291 --> 01:10:48.875
If you break this rule.

854
01:10:50.083 --> 01:10:51.666
for any reason.

855
01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:54.625
you'll go back to the convent.

856
01:10:57.916 --> 01:10:59.916
Am I clear?

857
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.333
Okay. then.

858
01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:36.333
Attention!
We're going through an air pocket!

859
01:11:36.416 --> 01:11:40.000
We're going through an air pocket!
Turbulence!

860
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:44.833
Honey.

861
01:11:48.666 --> 01:11:49.708
What's wrong?

862
01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:51.791
Mommy.

863
01:12:11.166 --> 01:12:14.833
This happens to some pregnant women.
Hormones. stress.

864
01:12:14.916 --> 01:12:16.333
It was the children.

865
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.583
They're punishing me for what I did.

866
01:12:19.666 --> 01:12:21.625
You see perversion everywhere.

867
01:12:22.375 --> 01:12:25.750
-They couldn't do something like this.
-You always take their side.

868
01:12:27.791 --> 01:12:31.708
Why do you never consider
the remote possibility that I'm right?

869
01:12:32.583 --> 01:12:34.083
Daddy.

870
01:12:34.958 --> 01:12:39.166
Daddy? Can you come down to play. please?

871
01:12:41.708 --> 01:12:42.625
I'm coming!

872
01:13:02.541 --> 01:13:05.333
One. two. three

873
01:13:05.416 --> 01:13:08.416
We're all here back at it

874
01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:15.000
This is a fun contest
Designed to test your wits

875
01:13:15.083 --> 01:13:20.833
Please. leave your bad mood behind

876
01:13:20.916 --> 01:13:25.958
And transform your TV into a toy

877
01:13:27.458 --> 01:13:29.875
One. two. three

878
01:13:29.958 --> 01:13:33.000
Please. pay attention

879
01:13:33.083 --> 01:13:38.791
Because we're about to start the show

880
01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:50.666
Good evening. and thank you
for being with us once again.

881
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:54.083
Tonight. I'm allowing myself
to treat you all informally

882
01:13:54.166 --> 01:13:57.833
because we're dedicating
today's program to the kids…

883
01:13:57.916 --> 01:13:58.791
Hello?

884
01:13:59.333 --> 01:14:02.791
Hi. This is Lola. Tin and Tina's mom.

885
01:14:03.916 --> 01:14:05.541
I don't know if you remember me.

886
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.875
Of course I remember you.

887
01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:11.458
I just wanted to know
how your son was doing.

888
01:14:12.791 --> 01:14:13.875
Is he feeling better?

889
01:14:15.625 --> 01:14:18.041
My son died three days ago.

890
01:14:31.791 --> 01:14:32.666
Lola?

891
01:14:41.208 --> 01:14:42.458
Hey. what's wrong?

892
01:14:45.916 --> 01:14:47.125
The boy died.

893
01:14:49.041 --> 01:14:50.750
Don't go. please.

894
01:14:51.875 --> 01:14:53.875
Call in sick and say you can't go today.

895
01:14:53.958 --> 01:14:55.458
You know I can't do that.

896
01:14:58.375 --> 01:14:59.416
I beg you.

897
01:15:00.208 --> 01:15:02.833
-Don't leave me alone with them.
-You need to rest.

898
01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.791
For your own good. and the baby's.

899
01:15:07.208 --> 01:15:10.458
So now you'll go to bed.
and you'll sleep for a very long time.

900
01:15:11.583 --> 01:15:14.083
And tomorrow.
when you wake up. I'll be here. okay?

901
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.041
Do you promise?

902
01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:19.041
I promise.

903
01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:21.875
Come on.

904
01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:30.375
Daddy?

905
01:15:32.041 --> 01:15:34.041
Why doesn't Mom love us anymore?

906
01:15:36.541 --> 01:15:37.708
What do you mean?

907
01:15:39.541 --> 01:15:41.833
She gives us weird looks.
doesn't talk to us.

908
01:15:42.375 --> 01:15:43.875
Mom loves you very much.

909
01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:48.750
The thing is that pregnant women
get tired very easily.

910
01:15:49.291 --> 01:15:50.666
And she needs lots of love.

911
01:15:52.083 --> 01:15:54.625
Why not show her
how much you love her tomorrow?

912
01:15:54.708 --> 01:15:56.208
And your little brother too.

913
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.791
Now. give me a kiss. I have to go.

914
01:15:59.875 --> 01:16:03.166
-Kids. do you like to laugh?
-Yes!

915
01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:07.000
They like to laugh. That's horrible!

916
01:16:07.083 --> 01:16:11.166
Torquemada and his men
must be turning in their graves.

917
01:16:32.583 --> 01:16:33.500
Adolfo?

918
01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:49.583
Adolfo!

919
01:16:53.666 --> 01:16:54.500
Tin?

920
01:16:56.041 --> 01:16:57.625
What are you doing? Untie me.

921
01:17:03.666 --> 01:17:05.000
Tin. release me right now.

922
01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:09.708
Good morning. Mommy.

923
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:12.333
You need to rest and eat well

924
01:17:12.416 --> 01:17:14.208
or our brother won't be born.

925
01:17:16.791 --> 01:17:18.375
It has magic powder in it.

926
01:17:19.083 --> 01:17:21.458
-What?
-And for your entertainment at breakfast.

927
01:17:21.541 --> 01:17:24.166
with you today is Rupertín!

928
01:17:24.791 --> 01:17:27.583
One. two. three

929
01:17:27.666 --> 01:17:30.041
We're all here back at it

930
01:17:30.666 --> 01:17:33.916
This is a fun contest

931
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.916
Designed to test your wits

932
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.208
Please. leave your bad mood behind

933
01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:48.875
And transform your TV into a toy!

934
01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:51.666
Come on.

935
01:17:55.166 --> 01:17:56.041
It's not working.

936
01:17:56.708 --> 01:18:00.750
Well. we'll have to find another way
to feed our little brother.

937
01:18:01.375 --> 01:18:02.458
I've got it. Tina!

938
01:18:03.541 --> 01:18:04.958
Where are you going?

939
01:18:06.166 --> 01:18:07.541
Tina. untie me.

940
01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:15.625
Look.

941
01:18:16.375 --> 01:18:17.708
You never cease to amaze.

942
01:18:19.541 --> 01:18:21.541
What you're doing is a sin.

943
01:18:21.625 --> 01:18:23.083
and God will punish you.

944
01:18:24.208 --> 01:18:26.708
Religion is forbidden in this house.

945
01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:31.375
One. two. three

946
01:18:31.458 --> 01:18:34.500
Please. pay attention

947
01:18:35.041 --> 01:18:38.500
Because we're about to start the show

948
01:18:53.208 --> 01:18:54.083
Poison!

949
01:18:54.875 --> 01:18:55.708
Poison!

950
01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:57.500
Poison. poison!

951
01:18:58.666 --> 01:19:00.375
-Poison!
-Mommy?

952
01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.708
Stay away!

953
01:19:04.625 --> 01:19:06.375
It was just milk with sugar.

954
01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:11.916
Lola.

955
01:19:24.958 --> 01:19:27.125
Lola. it was just a kids' game.

956
01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:30.166
and you were pointing
a knife at them. for God's sake.

957
01:19:31.041 --> 01:19:34.041
-They wanted to poison me.
-They were making you breakfast.

958
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:35.875
It was my fault.

959
01:19:37.291 --> 01:19:39.041
I asked them to do something nice.

960
01:19:39.666 --> 01:19:42.875
I get you were scared
it would happen again. but it didn't.

961
01:19:43.416 --> 01:19:46.375
Everything went well.
and the baby is here with us.

962
01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:49.083
Let's start again.

963
01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:59.083
Mom and Dad are here.

964
01:20:00.708 --> 01:20:02.541
-Hi.
-There you go.

965
01:20:03.708 --> 01:20:04.833
He looks just like me.

966
01:20:07.041 --> 01:20:08.500
Hello. little prince.

967
01:20:10.916 --> 01:20:12.125
Oh my God.

968
01:20:17.375 --> 01:20:18.250
Come here.

969
01:20:24.416 --> 01:20:26.000
This is your little brother.

970
01:20:26.083 --> 01:20:27.791
He looks like a peanut.

971
01:20:29.166 --> 01:20:30.291
Can I give him a kiss?

972
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:34.666
Come on.

973
01:20:38.875 --> 01:20:40.208
But be careful.

974
01:20:44.041 --> 01:20:45.541
Hello. little brother.

975
01:20:48.541 --> 01:20:50.500
When are we going to baptize him?

976
01:20:51.291 --> 01:20:52.791
He's not getting baptized.

977
01:20:52.875 --> 01:20:56.416
But children that aren't baptized
go to limbo.

978
01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.458
and that's a horrible place.

979
01:20:58.541 --> 01:21:00.791
Lola. babies have always been baptized.

980
01:21:01.541 --> 01:21:04.708
This baby will decide his religion
when he's older.

981
01:21:05.958 --> 01:21:07.166
Times are changing.

982
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:08.583
Exactly.

983
01:21:08.666 --> 01:21:12.458
Now that we have this thing
you love so much called democracy.

984
01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:14.250
the majority decides.

985
01:21:14.916 --> 01:21:16.583
Who wants him to be baptized?

986
01:21:21.166 --> 01:21:23.500
No.

987
01:21:23.583 --> 01:21:25.375
The jury has spoken.

988
01:21:40.166 --> 01:21:41.000
See anything?

989
01:21:41.625 --> 01:21:42.625
No!

990
01:21:48.666 --> 01:21:49.500
Now?

991
01:21:51.583 --> 01:21:53.833
-Yes. we can see it now!
-Perfect.

992
01:21:55.666 --> 01:21:57.708
Good evening. ladies and gentlemen.

993
01:21:57.791 --> 01:22:00.541
from the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium

994
01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:01.541
in Madrid.

995
01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.250
where. in a few minutes…

996
01:22:03.333 --> 01:22:04.458
Mommy!

997
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.416
Mommy. come here!

998
01:22:08.083 --> 01:22:10.458
Mommy. look what we're doing!

999
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:14.791
Mommy!

1000
01:22:15.958 --> 01:22:17.500
A miracle!

1001
01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:22.083
We're walking on water!

1002
01:22:23.625 --> 01:22:24.750
Come on. get out.

1003
01:22:24.833 --> 01:22:27.125
Too much sun is bad for you.
Go put on lotion.

1004
01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.375
-Lola.
-What?

1005
01:22:28.458 --> 01:22:29.625
Bring me another.

1006
01:22:29.708 --> 01:22:35.625
There are many more photographers
on the field than what you see.

1007
01:22:52.625 --> 01:22:55.333
How's that omelet coming along. honey?
Game's about to start.

1008
01:22:55.416 --> 01:22:56.750
I'm doing my best. okay?

1009
01:22:57.708 --> 01:22:58.541
Hey.

1010
01:22:59.125 --> 01:23:01.541
-What?
-Aren't you forgetting something?

1011
01:23:25.666 --> 01:23:28.333
Urquiaga gets the ball. Now Santillana.

1012
01:23:29.250 --> 01:23:31.000
Passes the ball to Alexanko.

1013
01:23:31.666 --> 01:23:35.750
The players are moving to position.

1014
01:23:35.833 --> 01:23:38.333
Tin. I think she's gone.

1015
01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:40.916
Daddy. we're going to bapt--

1016
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.708
Kids. I want to watch the game in peace.

1017
01:23:43.791 --> 01:23:46.666
…Quini wasn't able to control the ball.

1018
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:48.000
being overtaken by Kaltz.

1019
01:23:48.083 --> 01:23:50.333
Throw-in for the Spanish team.

1020
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:55.375
Take it easy.

1021
01:23:59.333 --> 01:24:00.958
Here. chick. chick. chick.

1022
01:24:13.791 --> 01:24:15.458
Hello. little brother.

1023
01:24:34.166 --> 01:24:38.041
Camacho is on Rummenigge.

1024
01:24:39.291 --> 01:24:43.208
And again. Dremmler has the ball.
passes it to Bernd Förster.

1025
01:24:43.291 --> 01:24:47.000
Zamora is right next to him.
Kaltz gets the ball.

1026
01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:49.625
The German team is dominating the game.

1027
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.041
Easy.

1028
01:25:05.833 --> 01:25:07.458
Don't be nervous.

1029
01:25:07.541 --> 01:25:10.250
You need to be relaxed. okay?

1030
01:25:10.333 --> 01:25:11.833
…the back of the Spanish team.

1031
01:25:12.583 --> 01:25:13.833
There's Urquiaga.

1032
01:25:14.458 --> 01:25:17.000
Breitner gets the ball.

1033
01:25:17.083 --> 01:25:19.333
It's better if you hold him by the feet.

1034
01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:21.250
He's heavy.

1035
01:25:21.333 --> 01:25:23.791
Genesis 1-2.

1036
01:25:26.625 --> 01:25:29.333
"The Earth was formless and void."

1037
01:25:29.416 --> 01:25:31.916
"Darkness was over
the surface of the deep."

1038
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.333
"And the Spirit of God
was moving over the surface of the water."

1039
01:25:35.416 --> 01:25:36.250
Now?

1040
01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:42.708
"I will sprinkle clean water upon you.
and you shall be clean

1041
01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:46.875
from all your filthiness and your idols.
I will cleanse you."

1042
01:25:46.958 --> 01:25:50.250
"I will take the stony heart
out of your flesh.

1043
01:25:50.333 --> 01:25:52.583
and I will give you a heart of flesh."

1044
01:25:53.791 --> 01:25:54.625
Now.

1045
01:25:57.958 --> 01:25:58.791
Dremmler.

1046
01:26:00.125 --> 01:26:01.541
Dremmler to Kaltz.

1047
01:26:01.625 --> 01:26:04.875
The German team is dominating now.

1048
01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:12.500
Go. Move!

1049
01:26:13.333 --> 01:26:14.916
Can I take him out now?

1050
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.291
No. We need to purify him well.

1051
01:26:28.166 --> 01:26:29.583
Dremmler shoots…

1052
01:26:29.666 --> 01:26:31.083
-No!
-…and goal.

1053
01:26:31.625 --> 01:26:33.083
Arconada let it slip.

1054
01:26:34.208 --> 01:26:35.750
This game is a disaster.

1055
01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:53.708
Mommy?

1056
01:26:55.083 --> 01:26:56.375
What are you doing?

1057
01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:58.083
What's going on?

1058
01:26:58.166 --> 01:26:59.583
My baby!

1059
01:27:00.333 --> 01:27:01.833
What did they do to you?

1060
01:27:10.958 --> 01:27:11.916
Mommy?

1061
01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.250
We were just bapt--

1062
01:27:15.958 --> 01:27:17.666
But Daddy said we could--

1063
01:27:19.791 --> 01:27:21.458
What kind of father are you?

1064
01:27:22.083 --> 01:27:24.208
They drown your son
and you don't even notice!

1065
01:27:27.666 --> 01:27:29.000
-Give me that!
-No!

1066
01:27:29.083 --> 01:27:33.333
-No. Dad.
-Don't. please!

1067
01:27:34.083 --> 01:27:37.125
-No. please!
-No!

1068
01:27:37.666 --> 01:27:39.041
-No. Dad.
-No!

1069
01:27:41.083 --> 01:27:42.291
Please don't.

1070
01:27:42.916 --> 01:27:44.666
You're not my children.

1071
01:27:48.416 --> 01:27:49.250
No!

1072
01:28:07.083 --> 01:28:08.083
You sure about this?

1073
01:28:11.375 --> 01:28:12.208
Yes.

1074
01:28:31.875 --> 01:28:36.291
Happy one-month birthday to you
Happy one-month birthday to you

1075
01:28:36.375 --> 01:28:40.291
We all wish you
A happy one-month birthday to you

1076
01:28:40.375 --> 01:28:42.625
Yeah!

1077
01:28:43.583 --> 01:28:44.583
Cutie.

1078
01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:52.166
Okay. go to sleep.

1079
01:28:53.833 --> 01:28:54.708
Are you okay?

1080
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.458
The children.

1081
01:29:03.125 --> 01:29:05.458
They no longer have a family
to celebrate with.

1082
01:29:06.875 --> 01:29:09.458
We promised not to talk about it again.

1083
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:14.416
I wonder if I was a bad mother.

1084
01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:17.666
I'm sure they hate me.

1085
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:19.000
Don't torture yourself.

1086
01:29:20.291 --> 01:29:22.083
It was wrong to adopt them. End of story.

1087
01:29:22.625 --> 01:29:25.041
I told you they were strange.

1088
01:29:30.166 --> 01:29:34.916
Honey. if we want to be happy.
we need to look to the future.

1089
01:29:35.458 --> 01:29:37.500
And the future is this little man here.

1090
01:29:38.625 --> 01:29:40.666
He's the blood of our blood.

1091
01:29:44.166 --> 01:29:48.625
Dear baby Jesus.
you are a child. just like me.

1092
01:29:48.708 --> 01:29:53.708
For this. I love you so.
and I give you my heart.

1093
01:29:54.791 --> 01:29:58.250
Take it. as it is yours. not mine.

1094
01:29:59.916 --> 01:30:04.291
Dear baby Jesus.
you are a child. just like me.

1095
01:30:05.375 --> 01:30:09.875
For this. I love you so.
and I give you my heart.

1096
01:30:14.958 --> 01:30:16.166
Do you hear that?

1097
01:30:17.125 --> 01:30:18.916
It's the wrath of God.

1098
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.875
The wrath of God.

1099
01:30:23.208 --> 01:30:25.333
The day will come.

1100
01:30:25.416 --> 01:30:29.041
and then there will be justice.

1101
01:30:34.583 --> 01:30:36.458
Galatians 6:7.

1102
01:30:37.208 --> 01:30:39.041
"God is not mocked."

1103
01:30:40.041 --> 01:30:44.583
"For whatever a man sows.
that will he also reap."

1104
01:30:44.666 --> 01:30:47.083
"God is not mocked."

1105
01:30:47.625 --> 01:30:52.958
"For whatever a man sows.
that will he also reap."

1106
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:55.208
Good night. kids.

1107
01:30:55.291 --> 01:30:58.000
-Good night. Abbess.
-Good night.

1108
01:31:33.875 --> 01:31:35.416
I'll get a job.

1109
01:31:38.166 --> 01:31:39.000
As a seamstress.

1110
01:31:44.375 --> 01:31:45.875
Honey. don't talk nonsense.

1111
01:31:47.291 --> 01:31:48.750
Who would look after our son?

1112
01:32:07.208 --> 01:32:08.708
Can't you hear him?

1113
01:32:13.458 --> 01:32:14.500
Lola?

1114
01:32:16.958 --> 01:32:19.333
Lola. can you comfort the baby?
He's crying.

1115
01:32:19.416 --> 01:32:20.833
His father can comfort him.

1116
01:32:25.375 --> 01:32:28.625
You know I'm not good at it.
I'm asking you to please comfort him.

1117
01:32:30.375 --> 01:32:33.333
Do I have to get angry
in order for you to pick up your son?

1118
01:32:36.958 --> 01:32:38.708
I beg you. please.

1119
01:32:39.791 --> 01:32:40.625
Sorry.

1120
01:33:00.208 --> 01:33:01.208
Don't drive so fast.

1121
01:33:01.291 --> 01:33:02.625
I'm not going fast. honey.

1122
01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:09.166
Watch out!

1123
01:33:25.125 --> 01:33:26.583
Are you two okay?

1124
01:33:26.666 --> 01:33:27.916
What was that?

1125
01:33:28.666 --> 01:33:29.500
I don't know.

1126
01:33:30.125 --> 01:33:34.000
It must have been some deer.
There are a lot around here.

1127
01:34:07.625 --> 01:34:09.208
Good night. sweetheart.

1128
01:35:36.875 --> 01:35:38.375
You left the door open.

1129
01:35:39.708 --> 01:35:40.791
That's weird.

1130
01:35:40.875 --> 01:35:42.333
I could've sworn I closed it.

1131
01:35:43.666 --> 01:35:44.750
Come sit.

1132
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.750
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

1133
01:35:49.625 --> 01:35:50.625
Lola.

1134
01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:52.333
Please.

1135
01:35:58.041 --> 01:36:01.958
It was really easy to win the million.

1136
01:36:02.041 --> 01:36:03.833
Let's ask the audience.

1137
01:36:03.916 --> 01:36:07.458
Who would continue to play? Shout it out.

1138
01:36:07.541 --> 01:36:08.958
Me!

1139
01:36:09.041 --> 01:36:12.625
-And who would keep the oyster?
-Me!

1140
01:36:12.708 --> 01:36:16.541
What's right behind those doors. I wonder?

1141
01:36:16.625 --> 01:36:19.333
Françoise and Alejandra.
open them. if you please.

1142
01:36:19.416 --> 01:36:22.166
This amazing pumpkin!

1143
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.083
I think we'd be good at this.

1144
01:36:34.833 --> 01:36:36.000
Shall we give it a try?

1145
01:36:39.166 --> 01:36:40.250
Lola. what's wrong?

1146
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.375
Why'd you remove your ring?

1147
01:36:54.291 --> 01:36:55.416
You're kidding. right?

1148
01:36:57.083 --> 01:36:58.208
You're kidding. Lola?

1149
01:36:59.916 --> 01:37:01.041
Fuck!

1150
01:37:12.458 --> 01:37:13.291
Honey…

1151
01:37:15.250 --> 01:37:16.791
I've devoted my life to you.

1152
01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:23.500
I gave you a house.
clothes. food. and a son.

1153
01:37:26.041 --> 01:37:27.541
And this is how you repay me?

1154
01:37:30.291 --> 01:37:31.208
Lola…

1155
01:37:36.375 --> 01:37:37.458
I love you so much.

1156
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.666
I love you two so much.

1157
01:37:44.958 --> 01:37:47.291
Is it because you think
I've been a bad father?

1158
01:37:49.833 --> 01:37:52.375
Maybe you're right. but I can change.

1159
01:37:53.625 --> 01:37:55.625
I can change. and I'm going to change.

1160
01:37:59.666 --> 01:38:00.791
Where are you going?

1161
01:38:03.291 --> 01:38:04.291
To fix it.

1162
01:39:56.416 --> 01:39:57.875
Adolfo. I can see it now!

1163
01:39:58.958 --> 01:40:01.250
Just in case the light goes out.

1164
01:40:01.333 --> 01:40:05.625
you'll be able to enjoy the sun
on the terrace of an apartment in--

1165
01:40:34.166 --> 01:40:35.541
…like a windmill blade?

1166
01:40:35.625 --> 01:40:39.208
It's a plate. that's great
It's the Chinese spinning plate

1167
01:40:39.291 --> 01:40:42.875
Chinese spinning plate

1168
01:40:42.958 --> 01:40:45.750
Thin. Filipino

1169
01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:49.291
Chinese spinning plate…

1170
01:40:49.375 --> 01:40:50.541
Children?

1171
01:40:50.625 --> 01:40:52.916
…Thin. Filipino

1172
01:41:01.083 --> 01:41:04.208
If you don't like your homework
If your neighbors aren't great

1173
01:41:04.291 --> 01:41:07.833
Don't get bored. don't be silly
Play with the Chinese spinning plate…

1174
01:41:07.916 --> 01:41:08.791
Children?

1175
01:41:08.875 --> 01:41:11.541
What is that cool thing?
It flies and makes no noise

1176
01:41:11.625 --> 01:41:14.291
It's a plate from China
It's the Chinese spinning…

1177
01:41:14.375 --> 01:41:15.500
Where are you?

1178
01:41:15.583 --> 01:41:18.833
-I'll borrow yours
-You can borrow mine

1179
01:41:18.916 --> 01:41:22.666
What a racket. what a racket
Everybody is spinning plates

1180
01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:26.333
Chinese spinning plate

1181
01:41:26.416 --> 01:41:29.416
Thin. Filipino

1182
01:41:30.041 --> 01:41:33.625
Chinese spinning plate

1183
01:41:33.708 --> 01:41:36.625
Thin. Filipino

1184
01:41:56.375 --> 01:41:57.416
Children?

1185
01:42:02.958 --> 01:42:04.375
Don't hide.

1186
01:42:13.458 --> 01:42:15.166
This isn't a game. okay?

1187
01:42:28.208 --> 01:42:29.208
Which one was it?

1188
01:42:39.375 --> 01:42:41.333
Adolfo. the lights are out!

1189
01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:57.375
Come on.

1190
01:42:59.625 --> 01:43:00.916
Damn flashlight.

1191
01:44:14.166 --> 01:44:15.916
Adolfo!

1192
01:44:16.625 --> 01:44:18.125
Adolfo. I'm coming!

1193
01:44:18.208 --> 01:44:20.833
I'm coming. Adolfo!

1194
01:44:36.791 --> 01:44:38.083
Adolfo!

1195
01:44:38.875 --> 01:44:40.958
A blanket.

1196
01:44:48.083 --> 01:44:52.750
A blanket. Blanket.

1197
01:44:52.833 --> 01:44:54.958
No! Don't come in!

1198
01:44:55.041 --> 01:44:57.125
Don't come in!

1199
01:44:57.916 --> 01:45:01.000
No!

1200
01:45:37.791 --> 01:45:41.125
No!

1201
01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:46.333
My baby.

1202
01:47:09.250 --> 01:47:11.708
Help!

1203
01:47:12.250 --> 01:47:16.041
Please. help!

1204
01:52:06.875 --> 01:52:07.875
It's okay.

1205
01:52:39.708 --> 01:52:41.666
We have great people.

1206
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:45.375
The Spanish people.
who deserve all of our sacrifice.

1207
01:52:46.791 --> 01:52:49.000
After years of fear and uncertainty.

1208
01:52:49.083 --> 01:52:52.375
we can now officially say
that the transition period is over.

1209
01:53:10.166 --> 01:53:11.000
Lola?

1210
01:53:11.791 --> 01:53:14.541
Lola? Can you hear me?

1211
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:21.041
The police told me what happened.

1212
01:53:22.541 --> 01:53:24.541
I'm terribly sorry about your husband.

1213
01:53:27.541 --> 01:53:28.625
What happened?

1214
01:53:30.458 --> 01:53:33.666
They say he was struck by lightning.

1215
01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:39.625
Lightning?

1216
01:53:41.125 --> 01:53:45.458
Apparently. several bolts of lightning
struck the area last night.

1217
01:53:47.291 --> 01:53:48.416
A tragedy.

1218
01:53:49.541 --> 01:53:53.666
I've prayed for his soul. and for yours.

1219
01:53:54.333 --> 01:53:55.500
My baby?

1220
01:53:57.291 --> 01:53:58.875
He's safe and sound.

1221
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:03.291
God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.

1222
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:12.125
And the children?

1223
01:54:13.583 --> 01:54:14.958
Were they at the house?

1224
01:54:15.708 --> 01:54:16.666
At the house?

1225
01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:18.750
No.

1226
01:54:19.541 --> 01:54:22.583
Tin and Tina
slept in the convent last night.

1227
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.083
I woke them up myself this morning.

1228
01:54:27.083 --> 01:54:29.875
-But--
-No. They weren't there.

1229
01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:32.208
It's impossible.

1230
01:54:44.916 --> 01:54:46.208
The children…

1231
01:54:48.208 --> 01:54:49.708
are innocent?

1232
01:54:53.958 --> 01:54:56.208
They always have been.

1233
01:55:03.333 --> 01:55:04.833
They're innocent.

1234
01:55:04.916 --> 01:55:08.375
A reading of the Holy Gospel
according to Saint Matthew.

1235
01:55:08.458 --> 01:55:11.041
Verses 18:1-5. 10.

1236
01:55:11.125 --> 01:55:15.791
"At that time.
the disciples came to Jesus. saying.

1237
01:55:15.875 --> 01:55:19.375
'Who is the greatest
in the kingdom of heaven?'"

1238
01:55:19.458 --> 01:55:21.875
"Jesus called a little child to Him

1239
01:55:21.958 --> 01:55:25.208
and set him in their midst. and said…"

1240
01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:27.958
Mommy. do you like them?

1241
01:55:28.041 --> 01:55:29.625
"…and become like children…"

1242
01:55:29.708 --> 01:55:31.416
They're beautiful. son.

1243
01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:34.000
"…you will not enter
the kingdom of heaven."

1244
01:55:34.083 --> 01:55:39.375
"Therefore. whoever humbles himself
like this little child is greatest…"

1245
01:55:39.458 --> 01:55:40.583
Come. my daughter.

1246
01:55:40.666 --> 01:55:42.083
"…in the kingdom of heaven."

1247
01:55:42.166 --> 01:55:45.000
"And whoever receives
one such little child in My name…"

1248
01:55:45.083 --> 01:55:46.166
Can you put it on me?

1249
01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:47.916
"…receives Me."

1250
01:55:48.833 --> 01:55:52.458
"See that you do not despise
one of these little ones.

1251
01:55:52.541 --> 01:55:54.208
for I say to you that. in heaven.

1252
01:55:54.291 --> 01:55:58.333
their angels always see
the face of My Father."

1253
01:55:59.125 --> 01:56:00.291
Amen.
