00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.160
Zero...

4
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.360
two. seven. eight. three. eight.
nine. eight. six. five. eight. four.

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.000
Take in sail!

6
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.600
- Shout ahead!
- Right there.

7
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.640
- On four!
- One.

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.920
Two.

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.560
Three.

10
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.600
- Are we still here?
- Aye.

11
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.280
The truth is Hilma af Klint
tells us that her art

12
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.520
isn't abstract imaginations.

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.680
She painted what she saw

14
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.400
and what the spirits
guided her to paint.

15
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.480
There's a woman here to see you.

16
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.320
Hilma.

17
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560
She says she's your sister.

18
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.200
Oh no.

19
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.040
What does she want?

20
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.640
She said something
about building a temple.

21
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.640
Her bloody temple.

22
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.400
She has a drawing to show you.

23
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.680
Who is it?

24
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.920
Hilma the witch.

25
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.800
Tell her I'm dead.

26
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.760
Mr. af Klint is asleep.

27
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.360
He's not feeling too well.

28
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.480
No. No.

30
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.440
I'll burn them.
That's what you wanted. wasn't it?

31
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.840
One.

32
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
two.

33
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.280
three...

34
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.440
four...

35
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.120
five.

36
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.480
six.

37
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.000
seven.

38
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.480
eight.

39
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.080
nine.

40
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.800
ten.

41
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.200
eleven...

42
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.680
98.

43
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.200
99.

44
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.520
100.

45
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.040
Ready or not...

46
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.160
here I come.

47
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.920
Hilma?

48
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.240
- Where were you?
- Up there. Hiding.

49
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.760
You scared me.

50
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.840
- I saw you the whole time.
- Did you?

51
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.080
Hermina?

52
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.240
- You see anything?
- No.

53
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.800
Wait.

54
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.040
I want to go home.

55
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.520
Scientists can't just go home.
We need to be patient.

56
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.680
I'm hungry.

57
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.680
I don't think I want
to be a scientist anymore.

58
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.760
What did you find?

59
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.080
Hilma! Look at the shape.

60
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.240
Yes. it's a spiral.

61
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.160
- It's from the Stone Age.
- It's beautiful.

62
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.800
It must be.

63
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.160
Must be.

64
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.000
Hilma!

65
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.400
Hello.

66
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.040
It's a skeleton.

67
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.200
But why are they digging it up?

68
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.960
They want to study it.

69
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.760
They're scientists too.

70
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.080
Hermina. how do you know
it was a "she"?

71
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.520
- You could tell.
- How?

72
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.040
From the skeleton.

73
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.920
- Right there.
- That's impossible.

74
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.480
It was a Stone Age soldier
and it was a she.

75
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.680
- Have some lingonberries.
- Thank you.

76
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.080
- My drawings.
- Careful.

77
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.840
- The birds...
- Hermina.

78
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.240
- I want to study the birds.
- Yes. the birds and all the animals.

79
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.720
And the flowers. all that grows...

80
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.840
You can't determine the gender
based on the skeleton. Absurd!

81
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.200
- Absurd?
- Gustaf. don't be so sure.

82
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.240
It's just not science. is it?
If you think of it...

83
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.400
- Hilma?
- I'm here.

84
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.920
Where are we on the map?

85
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.400
NAUTICAL CHART BY GUSTAF AF KLINT

86
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.720
Here somewhere.

87
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.800
Look! The numbers.

88
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.520
Yes.

89
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.200
He measured everything.

90
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.360
Grandfather was a scientist too.

91
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.080
35.

92
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.560
18.

93
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.880
He sailed around the whole world.

94
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.960
27.

95
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.120
To measure the depths. Everywhere.

96
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.800
So ships wouldn't
get holes in them and sink.

97
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.560
That's right.

98
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.640
One fathom...

99
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.760
two fathoms...

100
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.520
three fathoms...

101
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.760
13 fathoms...

102
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.400
14 fathoms.

103
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.080
15 fathoms.

104
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.080
How deep can it get?

105
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.520
Deep.

106
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.240
We'll make our own
map one day. Hermina.

107
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.320
Of everything.

108
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.800
Everything in the world.

109
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.800
And everything else too.

110
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.400
'Cause we're scientists.

111
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.440
98. 99. 100.

112
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.080
Ready or not. here I come!

113
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.000
You're too fast for me.

114
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.960
What's that cough?

115
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.960
- How is she?
- You can't be in there now.

116
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.080
- Why? Why? Let me go...
- She needs to rest.

117
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.440
Why?

118
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.760
Is her fever down?

119
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.840
Hilma!

120
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.840
Hilma! Hilma!

121
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.120
- Don't...
- Papa. please. I have to see her!

122
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.480
- No. no.
- Please. Please.

123
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.960
Hilma.

124
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.400
No.

125
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.680
Tell me where you are. Hermina.

126
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.080
And then. all of a sudden.

127
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.480
it just went dark...

128
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.120
and these really strong
winds came in.

129
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.120
so from...

130
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.920
out of absolutely nowhere.

131
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.680
we found ourselves
in the middle of a raging storm.

132
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.080
I want to study the world...

133
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.920
to see how things are connected.

134
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.200
Are you interested
in anything else than flowers?

135
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.200
Mathematics.

136
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.560
geometry. biology.

137
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.120
astronomy.

138
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.880
My father taught me everything.

139
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.080
What about arts?

140
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.080
Art...

141
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.920
is a tool

142
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.720
in my research.

143
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.280
A tool?

144
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.600
Yes.

145
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.440
We're making a map of everything.

146
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.480
We?

147
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.720
I need to learn how to paint.

148
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.360
Oh yes. I mean. these are very
decorative. I must say that. though.

149
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.960
- They're studies.
- Studies? Studies of what?

150
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.120
I didn't mean to decorate.

151
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.440
MESSAGES FROM THE UNSEEN WORLD

152
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.680
ROYAL ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS

153
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.280
Excuse me. where are you going?

154
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.520
The technical school for artists.

155
00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.880
For painters.

156
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
The women's entrance is in the back.

157
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.840
A little mistake there. miss.

158
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.280
We've had a few very talented
female painters here

159
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.920
since we started
the ladies' section a few years ago.

160
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.760
Some really artistic things.

161
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.720
Look at this from last year.

162
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.360
You can't even tell
it was painted by a woman. can you?

163
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.840
No.

164
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.400
Can you?

165
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.080
Teacher's pet.

166
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.080
Did you see that?

167
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.840
- He's coming...
- She's mad.

168
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.120
Draw what you see.

169
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.760
We're less interested
in your fantasies.

170
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.680
My fantasies?

171
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.480
Aren't those things real?

172
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.200
Miss Klint. a word. please.

173
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.280
So what does Hilma
want to learn here?

174
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.160
I want to understand
the secrets of life.

175
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.960
And everything else too.

176
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.080
I'm Anna.

177
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.880
- Nice to meet you. I'm Hilma.
- I'm trying on a new dress.

178
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.720
Do you want to come along?

179
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.320
- They live on Kammakargatan.
- Which way?

180
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.000
I think it's this way.

181
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.040
Oh no. Women only.

182
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.320
Use the front door. young man.

183
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.080
All right.

184
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.720
Go on in. Enjoy.

185
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.440
You're ridiculous.

186
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.840
I have my ways.

187
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.640
Lots of these outfits.

188
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.200
One for this season.

189
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.560
Excuse me.

190
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.720
SPIRITIST SCRIPTURES

191
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.040
Hilma. what do you think?
Isn't it gorgeous?

192
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.640
- It's beautiful.
- Look how it moves.

193
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.760
- Thank you so much.
- It's perfect on you.

194
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.240
I love it.

195
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.600
Take one.

196
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.560
- Thank you.
- We publish them monthly.

197
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.680
Here. Would you like one?

198
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.240
It's my sister. Mathilda.
She's the editor.

199
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.760
- It's our magazine.
- Thank you.

200
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.440
It's on Spiritism.

201
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.840
Cornelia does the drawings.
I do the writing.

202
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.120
- I do.
- You never told me you're an artist.

203
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.720
- She's a good one too.
- I'm not an artist like you.

204
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.600
Hilma's an incredible artist as well.

205
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.920
- She goes to school with me.
- Do you?

206
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.840
I'm so envious.

207
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.280
THE TRUTH SEEKER

208
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.960
"The spirit survives
through time and place.

209
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.240
All matter is conscious.

210
00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.200
All matter has life.

211
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.120
All life reincarnates."

212
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.400
Today. when our Christian religion

213
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.200
is being questioned and undermined...

214
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.080
we can still trust
in the presence of the spirits.

215
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.800
They surround us...

216
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.040
and are always willing
to communicate with us.

217
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.840
That's Sigrid.
She's a really powerful medium.

218
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.880
This higher consciousness
is the immortal part of ourselves.

219
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.960
The part that never dies.

220
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.480
Just as when we sleep

221
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.440
and our dreams
liberate our body from our mind...

222
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.720
it is death
that liberates the spirit.

223
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.080
so that we can reincarnate
and return to this earth.

224
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.840
We theosophists see no conflict

225
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
between science and religious belief.

226
00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.520
But it is religion.

227
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.960
all religions...

228
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.560
that explain the truth
of our higher consciousness.

229
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.080
That which cannot be seen.

230
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.800
I was dead.
but I could see myself from above.

231
00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.400
lying in the hospital bed.

232
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.560
- No!
- Saw it?

233
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.640
It was like I was floating.
looking down on myself.

234
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.240
And I saw the doctor slap my face.

235
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.160
trying to wake me up.

236
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.840
But I was dead.

237
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.720
But I could see and hear everything.

238
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.800
I was in another world.

239
00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.160
- And there was this bright light...
- Light?

240
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.760
...spinning all around me.

241
00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.600
It's so hard to explain. because
there isn't a light on earth like it.

242
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.720
She wasn't even dead.
She was hallucinating.

243
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.520
And she survived.

244
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.080
INSIGHTS INTO THE HIDDEN LIFE
OF THE HUMAN SOUL

245
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.800
Hilma. Miss Cassel is here.

246
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.320
Coming!

247
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.280
- Sigrid.
- Hello.

248
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.280
- I'm Hilma.
- Hilma. Lovely to meet you.

249
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.000
Nice to meet you.
Your home is beautiful.

250
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.040
- Hello. I'm Anna. Cornelia's friend.
- I heard you were both coming.

251
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.760
- Thank you for having us.
- Of course.

252
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.520
Listening to the dream.

253
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.320
To all the dreams.

254
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.000
Without knowledge...

255
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.840
this realm is but an illusion.

256
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.240
'Tis a spiral.

257
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.960
That is the key.

258
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.560
Disappear.

259
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.640
Brush with the infinite is near.

260
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.560
An angel is present here.

261
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.960
Courage to focus on the dreams.

262
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.640
At the end of the breath
there is a key.

263
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.360
Seven thresholds.

264
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.320
Three is the first wave.

265
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.640
And. er...

266
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.920
- Well. hello.
- Oh please...

267
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.480
Come on now. love.
What's going on here?

268
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.200
I told you we were
having a gathering tonight.

269
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.080
A gathering?

270
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.040
So this is a gathering?

271
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.080
You should have told me before.
I would have brought more friends.

272
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.160
Darling. Darling. come here.

273
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.680
Have you met any boys
you like there in school?

274
00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.640
I love them.

275
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.960
Love them all.

276
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.480
Victor. dessert!

277
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.960
Yeah. Coming.

278
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.200
You're not going to paint
for an eternity. are you?

279
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.680
No one wants to marry a girl
who keeps painting all day.

280
00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.200
I don't go to school to get married.

281
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.400
Papa. come.

282
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.600
You know we can't afford
to take care of you.

283
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.040
I know.

284
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.520
Victor!

285
00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.240
Yes. Is there a problem?

286
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.080
Ask Mother.

287
00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.840
I don't have a problem.

288
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.600
You should go to war
instead of playing the fiddle.

289
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.680
I should find a husband instead
of wasting time in art school.

290
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.920
Right. Mother?

291
00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.640
Could you just for once
do something that girls would do?

292
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.200
What's for dessert?

293
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.480
When you think about
how old this building is...

294
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.600
Our most distinguished student.

295
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.520
Hilma af Klint. Please.

296
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.040
I just heard!
You and I will share an atelier.

297
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.240
Oh my gosh.
I wasn't sure what I was going to do.

298
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.920
I thought I'd have to live
with my parents after school.

299
00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.840
Belle. what are
you doing with the flowers?

300
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.400
- Hold them out to your brother?
- No.

301
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.520
No. this is... Belle!

302
00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.000
Remember you love
your brother very much.

303
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.920
And you want to give him flowers.

304
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.880
Can we please have the flowers?
There.

305
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.600
And bring your chin down a touch.

306
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.600
A token of love.

307
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.080
Hands out of your pockets
and stand up straight.

308
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.240
- Sorry.
- Belle. please.

309
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.600
Don't worry. Leave that.
I've got it drawn in.

310
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.040
The flowers are behind her back.
I only paint what I see.

311
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.320
If you could imagine the flowers
being presented to her brother...

312
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.600
Flowers out front.

313
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.560
There we go. Beautiful flowers.

314
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.560
"To really get to know the world...

315
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.880
look deeply within your own soul.

316
00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.440
And to really get to know yourself...

317
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.360
take an interest in the world."

318
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.920
That's good.

319
00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.520
Makes sense.

320
00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.240
"In the world..."

321
00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.120
And here it is.

322
00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.880
Who wrote it?

323
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.720
Rudolf Steiner.
an Austrian philosopher.

324
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.760
He says colour is the soul
of nature and the universe.

325
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:48.400
And through colours
we receive messages from the soul.

326
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.760
That's good too.

327
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.640
I must have met
this man in an earlier life.

328
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.520
He's like my soulmate.

329
00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.920
I need to sell a painting soon.

330
00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.640
Do you? Why?

331
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.320
I need the money.

332
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.920
Grandfather gave us the noble name...

333
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.960
but money didn't come
with it. unfortunately.

334
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.000
I'm the opposite.

335
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.560
Common name. Pots of money.

336
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.480
Money's never interested me.

337
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.800
Only rich people
don't care about money.

338
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.960
Look at this.

339
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.280
They're so beautiful.
Look at those birds. Can you see?

340
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.480
If I could die...

341
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.120
for just a second...

342
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.800
just to see what it would
look like on the other side...

343
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.800
I'm not so sure.

344
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.640
Where is that "other side"?

345
00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.200
What does it look like?

346
00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.320
Someone who's achieved
depth of soul...

347
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.120
will look at this
and they won't see just water...

348
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.080
they see God's creation.

349
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.360
Hear that. water?
You're God's creation.

350
00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.080
It's so pleased. Listen to it.

351
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.320
Faster! Faster!

352
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.840
I'm back at sea. Hilma.

353
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.680
My heart.

354
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.920
But don't worry about me.

355
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.720
The seas are calm.

356
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.840
Yes. that's his daughter.

357
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.520
Hilma.

358
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.800
Very odd girl.

359
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.480
She paints.

360
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.800
Paints.

361
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.720
Thank you.

362
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.160
Hilma.

363
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.960
It's all right.

364
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.400
Whatever it is.
it'll be good practice

365
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.160
and it's meant to be good money too.

366
00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.640
How do they pay you?

367
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.680
Don't know. I think per drawing.

368
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.520
- Surely. Surely?
- How much do they pay?

369
00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.320
I don't know. Lots.

370
00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.600
Don't care.

371
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.120
Take a good look at the muscles here

372
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.520
and draw how they're
connected to the vein

373
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.520
that runs all here.

374
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.560
- The smell is so bad.
- I did tell you.

375
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.240
I saw inside the vein.

376
00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.440
Oh my.

377
00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.760
It's like a whole new world.

378
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.640
- Take this.
- No. I can't.

379
00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.160
- Take it. I don't need it.
- Alright. thank you.

380
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.560
- Want some lunch?
- Of course.

381
00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.520
Ladies.

382
00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.160
Sorry to interrupt.

383
00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.400
Mr. Munch would want to invite you
to visit his exhibition at Blanch's.

384
00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.560
It opens today.

385
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.080
Please. make me an honour.

386
00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.000
Don't be sad.

387
00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.560
She's safe now where she is.

388
00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.200
My sister is always with me.

389
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.960
They all are...

390
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.520
with us.

391
00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.760
It's good. It's good.

392
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.760
Always paint it your way.

393
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.160
Good evening. all of thee.

394
00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.360
I am Amaliel.

395
00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.840
Thank you for opening
your eyes to see...

396
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.440
your ears to hear...

397
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.560
your hearts to receive.

398
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.120
All worlds are one.

399
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.440
The divine lives in everything.

400
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.720
I come with a purpose.

401
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.200
The secret worlds shall be revealed.

402
00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.760
You have been chosen
to document them in your art.

403
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.920
The unseen will be seen.

404
00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.200
The unseen will be seen.

405
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.320
We'll unveil our truth.

406
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.720
Uncover our secrets
for you to document.

407
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.680
It's a world you do not know...

408
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.320
but it lives in all of us.

409
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.480
I saw it.

410
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.480
All of us

411
00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.960
are one.

412
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.040
I saw it.

413
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.960
You really saw them?

414
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.400
- What do you mean?
- I don't understand.

415
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.760
They want us to paint
the invisible worlds.

416
00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.560
Hilma. we could lose our souls.

417
00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.400
- Cornelia...
- There are risks.

418
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.080
We must understand that.

419
00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.920
There are risks. Ernst Josephson's
gone completely mad.

420
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.200
- That's not fair.
- He was already mad. He's a man.

421
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.360
He's been signing his artworks
with the names of dead artists.

422
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.600
- We're not doing that.
- It's dangerous.

423
00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.760
But... I don't understand.

424
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.760
We've all been chosen
for this assignment?

425
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.480
They want it to be a painter.

426
00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.160
We can all take part. right. Anna?

427
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.080
- We'll all help out.
- Right. Of course.

428
00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.240
Hilma and Anna?

429
00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.760
But... who told you that?

430
00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.720
It came from the spirits.

431
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.360
- Well. I'm a painter too.
- Of course you are. It's just...

432
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.000
I guess you don't have
the education. Cornelia.

433
00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.200
- I didn't have that opportunity.
- Look. we are all chosen.

434
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.640
We are all chosen.
It's important work.

435
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.920
For this to succeed.
we all need to contribute.

436
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.320
Are you all accepting
of the assignment?

437
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.400
All the hard work that comes with it?

438
00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.160
Yes.

439
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Yes.

440
00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.040
We're ready.

441
00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.600
Watch out!

442
00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.720
There will be a period
of preparation for your task.

443
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.880
You will prepare through prayer...

444
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.280
refrain from eating meat...

445
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.520
heavy and unhealthy foods...

446
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.480
You will live
selflessly and frugally.

447
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.120
Pray for friend and foe.

448
00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.720
O Lord. guide me
and give me strength.

449
00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.720
Save me from temptation.

450
00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.640
Give us your world in truth...

451
00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.040
as you've created it.

452
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.120
Amen.

453
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.760
You have to eat something. Here.

454
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.200
Find the truth.

455
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.680
There is no religion
higher than truth.

456
00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:17.320
THE SECRET DOCTRINE
- H.P. BLAVATSKY

457
00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.200
Make a pact between the five of you.

458
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.040
You will know
when it is time to show the work.

459
00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.520
What did I say?

460
00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.560
So much.

461
00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.200
I feel so tired.

462
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.440
I can't do this anymore.

463
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.200
No. I'm too tired now.

464
00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.400
I just want to see my children.

465
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:54.840
Sigrid.

466
00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.560
It's a divine assignment. Sigrid.

467
00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.800
You have so much power.

468
00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.720
I have nothing left.

469
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.560
Sigrid. we'll all help you.

470
00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.000
We're doing this together.

471
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.160
Lunch? I'm starving. Aren't you?

472
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.160
Not really.

473
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.760
So gender means nothing.

474
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.600
God created only one soul.

475
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.520
then he divided it into two.

476
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.560
Rudolf Steiner describes it.

477
00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.280
Two souls. Man and woman.

478
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.160
Now they are drawn to each other.
They want to unite again.

479
00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.120
So man seeks woman.

480
00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.680
And woman seeks man. I assume.
But what do I know?

481
00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.760
Yes. It's the dual force
that brings them together.

482
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.800
And we are going to use that force.

483
00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.080
The dual force?

484
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.640
It's a creative force.

485
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.880
The desire to unite.

486
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.640
We can use it in our paintings.

487
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.920
The way you're using it
to steal my potatoes?

488
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.240
Yes.

489
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.760
So I have the man's force
and you have the woman's.

490
00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.680
I seek the man's power and wisdom.

491
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.840
- I'm sure you do.
- I do.

492
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.680
And you have
the woman's power and warmth. right?

493
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.400
- Do I?
- You do.

494
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.360
Warmth?

495
00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.720
We're like... hook and eye.

496
00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.320
I hope so.

497
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.960
The perfect hook and eye.

498
00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.160
Come on.

499
00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:49.800
Hang on a minute.

500
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.400
You're the man. We should
have it the other way around.

501
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.080
- You should hook me.
- It doesn't matter who's who.

502
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.720
As long as I get to be the man.

503
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.520
Is it...

504
00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.000
Is it finished?

505
00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.400
Yes.

506
00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.720
It's finished.

507
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.600
So unusual.

508
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.800
I didn't paint it myself.

509
00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.800
- What do you mean?
- You did. Hilma.

510
00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.720
You painted it.

511
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.440
I was holding the brush.

512
00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.560
But I didn't paint it myself.

513
00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.360
But...

514
00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.160
I don't know.

515
00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.240
It's wonderful.

516
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.880
It was the spirits.

517
00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.680
The spirits.

518
00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.360
Hilma!

519
00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.000
It's extraordinary.

520
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.360
Everyone needs to know.

521
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.760
Everyone!

522
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.520
We must build a temple for our art.

523
00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.320
A temple for worship...

524
00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.360
of the arts.

525
00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:12.840
of the Lord.

526
00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.680
A temple that
will inspire future generations.

527
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.640
Where did you get this idea?

528
00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.120
I saw it.

529
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.920
The spirits came to me.

530
00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.320
So you're ready to show your work?

531
00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.200
Here's the entrance.

532
00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.840
Our art will hang
on the wall here and then...

533
00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.080
you rise up to the Divine.

534
00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.480
Hilma.

535
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.760
Yes?

536
00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.240
Can I help you?

537
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.160
I need my dual soul.

538
00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.800
I need that to inspire me.

539
00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.320
Do you?

540
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.720
You want to be the hook?

541
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.240
I'll be the eye.

542
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.080
It's big.

543
00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.640
It's a big temple.

544
00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.160
It's not too big.

545
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.080
All right.

546
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.840
Tell me it's not too big.

547
00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.800
Hilma...

548
00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.240
- Hilma!
- Say it. Say it. Say it.

549
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.800
- Hilma. get off of me.
- Say it.

550
00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.800
- Get off... Hilma!
- Say it.

551
00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.520
- What are you doing?
- Say it.

552
00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.320
Get off.

553
00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.520
Say it.

554
00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.080
It's not...

555
00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.160
The eggs you ordered?

556
00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.440
Hilma. get off!

557
00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.800
Hilma...

558
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.600
Thank you.

559
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.080
PURPLE

560
00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.400
Hilma. what's the matter?

561
00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.200
Yeah. I think so.

562
00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.200
The one in black is my aunt.

563
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.440
She's the weird one.

564
00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.440
Erik!

565
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.480
Stop it.

566
00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.080
Come here.

567
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.360
- I just want to see her paintings.
- Well. they are nothing to see.

568
00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.960
- Why can't I see them?
- It's just... What for?

569
00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.360
'Cause she's a witch.

570
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.440
When do we get to have
a look at what you're up to?

571
00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.000
You can't see it yet.

572
00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.080
It's not finished.

573
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.960
I can't see it anyway.

574
00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:34.200
Anna. you tell me.

575
00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.360
What is it that you're doing?

576
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.840
Well. we received this assignment
or commission as Aunt knows.

577
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.600
I know.

578
00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:48.640
And we're getting... instructions.
or Hilma gets instructions.

579
00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.920
And going well it is.

580
00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.640
but sometimes it's hard
to understand what comes out of it.

581
00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.080
What...?

582
00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.720
It's just...

583
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.320
It's hard to see
what it's supposed to represent.

584
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.640
You can't see what you paint?

585
00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.920
I mean. what they mean.

586
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.040
the paintings.

587
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.400
I thought we could tell the truth.

588
00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.800
- We don't know what we're doing?
- Do we?

589
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.720
I got an assignment
from the spirits...

590
00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:28.720
You got an assignment?
Weren't we working together?

591
00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.920
Like the hook and the eye!

592
00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:32.960
We were.

593
00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.960
You... You gave up on it. didn't you?

594
00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.720
I just can't see
exactly what you see.

595
00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.760
And why do we paint
if we can't show people?

596
00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.760
I want to show my work.

597
00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.360
Why do we keep hiding it?
What are we waiting for?

598
00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.920
Anna!

599
00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.200
Scientists...

600
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.520
...don't present their findings
until their research is finished.

601
00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:06.000
I'm not finished.

602
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.720
They need to hang together. As one.

603
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.160
The paintings.

604
00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:20.400
It's part of a map of a world.

605
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.760
So tell me
why you're so afraid of sharing them?

606
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.960
I'm not afraid.

607
00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.960
So this is part
of our ten largest series.

608
00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.600
Sorry. excuse me.

609
00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:03.160
Hello. You can leave them
over there by the table.

610
00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.560
Thank you.

611
00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.640
So sorry.

612
00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:11.520
So these are depicting our life
cycles from childhood to old age.

613
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.560
- Hilma?
- This one's  Adulthood .

614
00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.000
- Yes?
- Sorry. can I just check something?

615
00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:22.160
- I just want to check this yellow.
- It looks like the sun.

616
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.880
What do you think?

617
00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:36.120
We will have an exhibition
of them in a couple of weeks.

618
00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:39.320
Now you can finally see them.

619
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.680
That's very exciting.

620
00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.320
These are some
of the ten largest ones.

621
00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:48.600
These are  Adulthood
and then here is...

622
00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:52.880
Wait.

623
00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:00.880
What do you think?

624
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.040
It's beautiful.

625
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.000
It's wonderful. Hilma.

626
00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:21.960
Hilma?

627
00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.960
Hilma. Hilma.

628
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.080
Number six. please.

629
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.800
Can you see anything?

630
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.400
I can see a head.

631
00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.600
I think it's the doctor.

632
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.800
That is correct.

633
00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.440
Number five. please.

634
00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.120
Light! I'm in heaven!

635
00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:31.840
- I'll take care of it.
- I can... I can pay it this time.

636
00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:37.840
And this is going
to be your new typewriter.

637
00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.840
Can I ask if we can get her?

638
00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:44.240
- She seems sweet.
- Yeah.

639
00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

640
00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.800
"The Swede Oscar Swahn
won the gold medal

641
00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:52.400
in men's single shot
running deer yesterday

642
00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.800
during the
Olympic Games in London..."

643
00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.480
She's really nice.

644
00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.040
I can't afford her. You know that.

645
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.200
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

646
01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.840
"...the Swedish swimmer
Greta Johansson

647
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.600
also made her debut yesterday..."

648
01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.520
The gallerists. They were idiots.

649
01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.040
They just can't see it.

650
01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.600
I can rent
our own space for the exhibition.

651
01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.440
It's just across the street.

652
01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.720
Thank you.

653
01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.960
"The famous
Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner

654
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.480
pays another visit
to Stockholm next week.

655
01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.640
He'll be speaking
at the Royal Library on 16th..."

656
01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.560
Steiner.

657
01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.000
My soulmate is coming to Stockholm.

658
01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.080
He will understand.

659
01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.320
- What's soulmate in German?
- Seelenverwandter .

660
01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.160
- Seelenverwandter.
- Seelenverwandter.

661
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.720
- Perfect.
-  Seelenverwandter .

662
01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.000
Seelenverwandter.

663
01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.760
I know we will find the truth
about our existence

664
01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.360
and our unknown dimensions.

665
01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.360
Everything is possible.

666
01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.840
because there are no essential limits
to human knowledge.

667
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.240
Thank you.

668
01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:28.480
- Excuse me. please. please...
- Dr. Steiner.

669
01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.080
Dr. Steiner. autograph. please.

670
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.200
Hello.

671
01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.680
Please sign my book.

672
01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.040
Watch Mother. Thomasine.

673
01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.760
My friend here speaks German.

674
01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.600
Hilma sent Dr. Steiner a letter.

675
01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.520
Yes. I will read it.

676
01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.480
I'm an admirer of yours.

677
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.720
Dr. Steiner. we have to go.

678
01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.880
I've seen what you've seen.

679
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.800
I know what you describe.

680
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.000
Art is eternal. Its form changes.

681
01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.600
Dr. Steiner!
Could you please sign my...?

682
01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.840
That's true.

683
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.480
You wrote that.

684
01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.240
Hilma would be very pleased

685
01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.600
if you would come
to her atelier to view her paintings.

686
01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.960
You paint? I'd love to.

687
01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.280
Come on.

688
01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.040
Impressive.

689
01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.200
Did you paint these yourself?

690
01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.440
Yes.

691
01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.760
Wonderful colours.

692
01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.720
I'll have an exhibition
here in Stockholm of them

693
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.320
in a month from now.

694
01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.040
And what do the paintings depict?

695
01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.800
What is depicted. he's asking?

696
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.920
I don't know.

697
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.360
I was hoping Dr. Steiner
would explain it to me.

698
01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.960
This is  Adulthood .

699
01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.520
What inspires you. Miss Klint?

700
01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.000
What... inspires me?

701
01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:25.640
I get inspired by the High Masters.

702
01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.280
The spirits
that gave me this assignment.

703
01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.640
And my sister. Hermina.

704
01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.720
You see...

705
01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.520
divine things happen
when we put aside our ego

706
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.640
and make room for something else.

707
01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.800
Or someone else.

708
01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.680
Divine things will happen
when we forget ourselves.

709
01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.520
This way.

710
01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.480
I have been the tool of the spirits.

711
01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.240
I painted strictly
following their instructions.

712
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:20.280
So Miss Klint is
not herself creatively responsible?

713
01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:24.240
So you're not creatively responsible.
he asks.

714
01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:28.360
I... promised
the High Masters to obey their will.

715
01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.040
They chose me for this assignment.

716
01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.440
Yes. I understand. I understand.

717
01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.520
But if art doesn't originate
in the artist's soul...

718
01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.280
it doesn't touch me.

719
01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:46.120
But when art doesn't have
its roots in the soul of the artist

720
01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.040
it doesn't touch me. he says.

721
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.280
You see. the artist is the one
who is responsible creatively.

722
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.640
Yes. otherwise
you can hardly call it art.

723
01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.120
If the artist is not
creatively responsible.

724
01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.560
he doesn't think
it can be called art.

725
01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.920
But your quest is admirable.

726
01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.960
If we do not believe there is
something higher than ourselves.

727
01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:16.320
we will never find the strength
to develop into something higher.

728
01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.000
What did he say?

729
01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.880
If we do not believe in something...
higher than ourselves...

730
01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.720
then we shall never find the strength
to evolve into something higher.

731
01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.960
I don't understand him
even if you translate.

732
01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.960
What I'm saying is.
if I don't understand your art.

733
01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.800
then no one will.

734
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.760
If I don't understand your work.

735
01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.280
no one will.

736
01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.840
Humble gentleman.

737
01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.440
Hilma!

738
01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.640
Are you all right?

739
01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.280
Thank you.

740
01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:02.880
You all right?

741
01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.040
What an idiot!

742
01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.720
Get up now. Hilma!

743
01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.040
He's not worth this.

744
01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.000
He doesn't understand art.

745
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.360
He's just a pompous  besserwisser.

746
01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.760
- He had no right to criticise you.
- What does he know about the spirits?

747
01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:33.720
Hilma.

748
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.360
I've brought you some tea and toast.

749
01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.040
Here.

750
01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.440
Is that jam?

751
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.200
- Yes. Apricot jam.
- That's my favourite.

752
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.000
Stop fussing over her.

753
01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.600
She's all right.

754
01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.640
I can't do it.

755
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:53.000
We can't show the paintings.

756
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.280
- Cancel the exhibition.
- Are you serious?

757
01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.840
- You're not thinking straight.
- We can't cancel anything now.

758
01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.800
- Are you serious?
- They were painted for the temple.

759
01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.200
- Doesn't matter...
- Nothing else.

760
01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.440
- Hilma...
- Because of one man's opinion?

761
01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.160
If he doesn't understand them.
no one will.

762
01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.640
This is against everything
we stood for for years.

763
01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:15.640
We need to show this work.
For all of us.

764
01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.960
We've been working so long for this.
we can't just give up on it now.

765
01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.320
Hilma. it's not just your work.

766
01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.040
We all worked on them.

767
01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.120
Cornelia did a lot of the drawings.

768
01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.080
The spirits worked on them. Hilma.

769
01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.680
I'm not showing them!

770
01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:37.080
- How do you make it look so real?
- That's very kind. Thank you.

771
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.600
Wonderful choices.

772
01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.080
I have to admit. I didn't know
what to think of your big ones.

773
01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.960
The place has provided
a lot of the inspiration for me.

774
01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.680
Oh. Hilma.

775
01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.560
I miss the new ones too.

776
01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.120
Do you like them?

777
01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.080
Are you all right?

778
01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.000
Hilma. drink this. all right?

779
01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.200
You all right?

780
01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.240
- Have you seen Kandinsky?
- Kandinsky! He's Russian.

781
01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.960
Fabulous. It's wonderful.
It's non-figurative.

782
01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.640
Take a moment with each painting.

783
01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.520
Kandinsky. as you can see.
is entirely unique.

784
01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.040
He's what we call non-figurative art.

785
01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:23.520
It's something new
and quite breath-taking. I would say.

786
01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.520
Take a moment with each painting.

787
01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:30.560
When Kandinsky makes
this non-figurative art.

788
01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.440
he wants to affect us emotionally.

789
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.400
the way music affects us.

790
01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.240
He wants us to stop thinking
and only experience...

791
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.800
There you are.

792
01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:45.000
- Kandinsky is the first...
- Listen... Hilma!

793
01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.040
- ...to make non-figurative art.
- What's wrong?

794
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.800
Come on. come and sit down.
You're all right. You're all right.

795
01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.160
Please concentrate here

796
01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:10.880
on the hoof and the ligaments
as they move up into the muscle.

797
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.520
It's nice. Just the two of us again.

798
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:26.960
I miss this.

799
01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.840
You know you can't expect me
to keep paying for everything you do.

800
01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.200
I want to support your arts.
but nothing else.

801
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.520
I don't think there's
any art left to support.

802
01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.680
I don't paint anymore.

803
01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.240
Because of an old codger
from Germany!

804
01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:58.280
He's Austrian.
And he's my soulmate.

805
01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.120
I can't continue
to support your romantic interests.

806
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.920
Very nice. ladies. Very nice.

807
01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.440
What do you mean?

808
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.880
Don't you think I have eyes?

809
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.880
Thomasine takes care of my mother.

810
01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.400
Where does she find the time with
everything else that keeps her busy?

811
01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.920
Do you care about me?

812
01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.320
Am I invisible like everything else
you're portraying?

813
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.800
Why should I pay
for your obsession with the spirits?

814
01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:45.760
I never asked you to pay
for anything for me.

815
01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.680
What do I owe you?

816
01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.920
How do I get you
to see what you're blind to?

817
01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.880
You don't even
try to see beyond what's here.

818
01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.960
- I tried! You just looked away.
- You and your mountains and sunsets!

819
01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.600
Can't you see anything else?

820
01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.200
Not a single penny more from me.

821
01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:47.680
There's a step here.

822
01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.080
Ready?

823
01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.840
- Here?
- Yes.

824
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.400
You all right?

825
01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.240
- Welcome home. Anna.
- Thank you. So good to see you again.

826
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.560
Soon as we can afford it.
we'll move to something bigger.

827
01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.200
Thomasine!

828
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.440
Yes.

829
01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.960
I'm here.

830
01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.800
Who's going to pay for you?

831
01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.240
You don't have to worry
about that. I'm right here.

832
01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.400
We don't have the money.

833
01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.720
You know we can't afford you.
don't you?

834
01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:40.480
It's not for you to worry about.

835
01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.960
I'm so sorry. Thomasine.

836
01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.200
When do you need to go back
to your work at the doctor's office?

837
01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.320
Do you want me to?

838
01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.640
No. of course not.

839
01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.240
I've been thinking.

840
01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.440
I can take care of Mother myself.

841
01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.560
I have the time.

842
01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.000
Where do you want me to put these?

843
01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.640
In the cupboard.

844
01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.120
Thank you.

845
01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.280
You've never seen
that one before. have you?

846
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.520
It's beautiful.

847
01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.000
"Dear Anna...

848
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.840
I'm lost.

849
01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.040
How do you draw a map
when you forgot how to draw?

850
01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.120
And you can't see where you are?

851
01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:55.400
I want to understand the universe.

852
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.600
I want to get to know God for real.

853
01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.040
Is that too much to ask?"

854
01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.640
"Dear Hilma.

855
01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.960
I'm so happy to be back home.

856
01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.880
Everything I love is here.

857
01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.000
God's creation
right in front of my eyes.

858
01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.080
Visible to everyone.

859
01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.760
I don't need your depth
of soul to see it. thankfully.

860
01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.800
The air here is good for me.

861
01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.600
My asthma's almost gone now."

862
01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:36.160
I miss you. Hilma.

863
01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:41.680
"This is us. in the wave we were in.

864
01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.720
I made it at your summer house.

865
01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.600
Never dared to show you."

866
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.280
"Mr Tryggve Janson suggested

867
01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.600
that married women
who paid their own taxes.

868
01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.640
could get the right to vote.

869
01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.560
Carl Persson
in Stallerhult disagreed.

870
01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:04.760
'If women were allowed to walk away
from their wife duties to vote.

871
01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.280
it would hurt the children
and create domestic chaos.'"

872
01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.000
Sorry.

873
01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.800
"Alfred Ander...

874
01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:24.120
the robber. who killed
Victoria Hellsten with a steel yard.

875
01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:28.240
was executed today with
the guillotine imported from France.

876
01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.240
The head was separated
from the body at eight to five.

877
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.720
in front of
the Langholmen officials."

878
01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.200
Why. that's awful.

879
01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.880
Can you imagine?

880
01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.520
Here you go.

881
01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.160
"Dear Anna..."

882
01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.280
- What is it?
- "I've begun painting again."

883
01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:33.920
- Black swan...
- "It's a miracle."

884
01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:36.920
No. A black swan?

885
01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.240
"I still take
advice from the spirits.

886
01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.680
But this time
I'm guiding the brush myself.

887
01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:52.800
I think you'll be able to tell
what I'm portraying this time.

888
01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.560
Thomasine has promised to stay with
us for as long as we need her help.

889
01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.080
And we do need her right now.

890
01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.720
I keep working on that map
of the world I told you about.

891
01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.400
My sister is helping me.

892
01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.320
I'm inspired by her. by the sea.

893
01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:20.520
by all the things we remember
from the summers at Adelsö.

894
01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.080
while waiting for the temple.

895
01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.920
We get by
on a few commissions and portraits."

896
01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.200
"For everyone that asketh. receiveth.

897
01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.600
And he that seeketh. findeth.

898
01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.000
And to him that knocketh.
it shall be opened."

899
01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.320
"Dear Hilma.

900
01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:44.920
I'm happy to hear that you've
found a way to support yourself.

901
01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:47.800
There's nothing wrong
with showing your art

902
01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:49.760
and even getting paid for it."

903
01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:52.400
"What a Christmas present this year.

904
01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.480
Guess who's coming to Stockholm?"

905
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.680
"No. not him again.

906
01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:02.280
You're not going there. are you?

907
01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:05.120
Why are you so obsessed with him?"

908
01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.360
Dr. Steiner!

909
01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.200
"He has seen God.

910
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.080
And he knows the truth.

911
01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.560
And I...

912
01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.480
have to find it."

913
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.960
Dr. Steiner!

914
01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.000
Welcome back to Sweden.

915
01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.360
Do you remember me?

916
01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:21.960
Of course. Miss Klint.

917
01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.240
Yes.

918
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:28.000
Can we talk somewhere in private?

919
01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.320
Since we last met.

920
01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.280
I paint differently.

921
01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.000
I work with the spirits.

922
01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.920
I don't allow the spirits...

923
01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.040
to take over. to decide.

924
01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.880
That's good news. Miss Klint.

925
01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.280
Thank you.

926
01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.760
Can I show you my work in the future?

927
01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.600
I can mail you my miniatures.

928
01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.280
Don't go chasing after him again.

929
01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.920
You're desperate for his approval.

930
01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.720
And he's never
going to give it to you.

931
01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:11.440
- Anna. that's ridiculous.
- He almost killed your passion...

932
01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.720
- He wants to see what I'll paint.
- You're obsessed!

933
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:17.160
- That's not what a soulmate does.
- I'm posting him all my miniatures.

934
01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.920
- What do you think?
- So exciting.

935
01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:23.800
- This will have a view of the water.
- So that's the front or the back?

936
01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:26.000
This is... This is the front...

937
01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.720
"I've designed an atelier
together with the girls.

938
01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:38.760
We're building it at Munsö.
next to Adelsö.

939
01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.440
It's not the temple.

940
01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.680
It's an atelier for me and the girls.

941
01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.920
The girls are going to pay for it.

942
01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.400
I assume you don't want
to be part of it financially."

943
01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.160
"How lovely.

944
01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.440
Good for you."

945
01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.560
Mother. you look wonderful.

946
01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.720
- Can I see?
- It's not ready.

947
01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:37.080
- Hilma. show her.
- Please.

948
01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.400
Go on. show me.

949
01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.600
Ready?

950
01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.000
Lunch!

951
01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.400
Hello!

952
01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.560
It's Anna.

953
01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.520
You came!

954
01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:44.880
You came.

955
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.800
I'm so sorry it's taken so long.

956
01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:49.000
I don't know
why I went in the first place.

957
01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.800
- It's all right. You're here.
- Hello!

958
01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:55.120
- Anna! How are you?
- How are you? You look so well.

959
01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.920
So good to see you.

960
01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.080
Hello. how are you?

961
01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.800
- It's so good to see you all.
- Did you know about this?

962
01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:11.000
What do you think?

963
01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.040
This is beautiful.

964
01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.920
Okay.

965
01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.800
Did you drop me?

966
01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:31.120
- It's all right.
- Thomasine. what is it?

967
01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.880
- Someone get help.
- She needs air.

968
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.080
- What happened?
- Take her scarf off.

969
01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.480
- Let's bring her inside.
- Please stand back!

970
01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.080
Why do you still need her here?

971
01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.920
Her job was to take care
of your mother!

972
01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.400
- You're being ridiculous.
- Is she taking care of you now?

973
01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:15.160
What are you suffering from
that needs full-time care?

974
01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.760
What am I suffering from?

975
01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:22.600
I suffer from being belittled
by you right now. Anna.

976
01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.920
I suffer from old friends who can't
deliver on their commitments.

977
01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.840
I suffer. because...

978
01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.880
I suffer and you don't.

979
01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.200
I'm sorry. Anna.

980
01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:41.160
I never wanted
to be your charity case.

981
01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:43.840
I'm embarrassed.

982
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.960
I supported your life.
your career. I supported you...

983
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.440
With money you didn't even earn.

984
01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:55.680
I only ever wanted
your understanding.

985
01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:03.040
Do you even believe in spirits. Anna?

986
01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.320
You never did. did you?

987
01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:09.960
You may have just
played along to get to me.

988
01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.520
Anna. I'm sorry.

989
01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.880
- Anna. I'm sorry.
- Get up. Thomasine!

990
01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.560
- Where are you going?
- You have to take care of Hilma.

991
01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:26.000
Get up!
You have to take care of Hilma.

992
01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.000
- What's going on?
- Get up!

993
01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.080
Are you all right? What's going on?

994
01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:32.960
She's sick because of you.

995
01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.280
Get up! You have to take care of her.

996
01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:38.040
- Don't touch her.
- Get off me. You're sick.

997
01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.880
Let's eat.

998
01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.800
Have some water. Hilma.

999
01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.720
No.

1000
01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:47.040
No.

1001
01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:00.280
"Dear Miss Klint.

1002
01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:04.440
I think it would be interesting
to discuss your art a bit further.

1003
01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:11.200
We have looked at the miniatures
you sent us and we'd be delighted

1004
01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.640
if you could come and visit us
here in Switzerland."

1005
01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.000
"We have looked
at the miniatures you sent us

1006
01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:21.640
and we'd be delighted if you could
come visit us here in Switzerland."

1007
01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:25.000
- "Delighted." Are you sure?
- Yes.

1008
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.520
Erfreut.

1009
01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:29.720
Happy. Glad.

1010
01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.440
Glad.

1011
01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.480
It doesn't matter.
He wants to see you.

1012
01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:38.120
"...where we have the world's
centre for anthroposophy."

1013
01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:41.960
Passports. please.

1014
01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:47.400
Go on. Keep reading.

1015
01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.880
Hilma af Klint?

1016
01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.960
Sorry. it's an old photo.

1017
01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:58.800
"We have just finished
building our temple."

1018
01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.600
So...

1019
01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.240
With the permission
of the High Masters.

1020
01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:30.600
we want to donate
our work to Goetheanum.

1021
01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.520
The temple we've been looking for
for so many years.

1022
01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:45.480
I'm honoured that you accepted
my invitation to come here.

1023
01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:49.960
So many new works here.

1024
01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:55.960
But you've changed your style. right?

1025
01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:00.320
He wonders if you have changed
the way that you paint.

1026
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.360
No.

1027
01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:09.920
Listen.

1028
01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:14.400
I think that art
that connects us with the spirits...

1029
01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:18.600
should be suggestive. poetic.

1030
01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:23.240
It should aim for the heart
and not for the brain.

1031
01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.640
What you've got here...

1032
01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:31.840
It's too intellectual for us.

1033
01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:34.160
Well...

1034
01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:39.800
I don't think this kind of art
will ever be relevant.

1035
01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:41.360
I'm sorry.

1036
01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:46.840
What does he say?

1037
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:48.440
He doesn't want them.

1038
01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:51.240
What else?

1039
01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:55.280
He says that art that manages
to connect us to the spirits...

1040
01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.920
is suggestive. poetic...

1041
01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:01.640
and aims for the heart.
not for the head.

1042
01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:04.480
He thinks your work
is too intellectual.

1043
01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.040
He doesn't have
the heart to understand it.

1044
01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.560
Not the head either.

1045
01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:18.920
Tell him.

1046
01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:21.080
Tell him that.

1047
01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:26.600
First...

1048
01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:31.240
First you tell me I shouldn't paint

1049
01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.360
with the help of my spirits.

1050
01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.800
Now you tell me
that I can't use my brain.

1051
01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:48.000
Too intellectual.
because you don't understand them.

1052
01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.840
You have to get over it.

1053
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.040
He's dead.

1054
01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.720
There's nothing you can do about it.

1055
01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:26.320
Dr. Steiner. what do you think?

1056
01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:35.080
Do you think there will come a day
when people will like them?

1057
01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.800
You're quiet.

1058
01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.560
So you don't know.

1059
01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:51.040
Liar.

1060
01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.760
You understood everything.
didn't you?

1061
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.520
Didn't you?

1062
01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.400
Why can't you admit it?

1063
01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:55.760
"My latest sunset.

1064
01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:58.040
You can't even tell
it's painted by a woman.

1065
01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.240
Can you?

1066
01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:10.200
It's been too long. Hilma.

1067
01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.920
I'm coming to Stockholm.
I need to see you.

1068
01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:16.680
My train arrives Thursday
next week at ten to five.

1069
01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:18.440
Will you meet me there?"

1070
01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:08.400
I missed the train. Hilma.

1071
01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:10.960
I know.

1072
01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:14.560
I know you did.

1073
01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:17.920
I'm here now.

1074
01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.200
Here. Where you are.

1075
01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:27.320
I miss you. Anna.

1076
01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:33.160
There are so many things
I recognise here.

1077
01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.800
That it would take all this
to become a believer!

1078
01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:33.680
So this way.

1079
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.960
you can walk in a circle

1080
01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:39.200
and experience
all the big ones that hang together.

1081
01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:40.600
They must hang together.

1082
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:43.400
But this way you never walk back.
You just keep going.

1083
01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.480
It's like a spiral-shaped temple.

1084
01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:48.520
reaching for the heavens.

1085
01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:50.880
Open for worship of...

1086
01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:52.600
all religions.

1087
01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.400
Art and science.

1088
01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.880
Aunt. I've tried. but...

1089
01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:02.080
No one is willing to give us
the money to build it. so...

1090
01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.200
I'm sorry.

1091
01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:36.920
Anna would have paid
for the temple had she been alive.

1092
01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:39.560
- And Thomasine...
- Aunt. Aunt.

1093
01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:42.600
I'm sorry.

1094
01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.600
But no one...

1095
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.920
No one understands what you're doing.

1096
01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.800
Then...

1097
01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:00.560
burn them all.

1098
01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:04.040
Burn them!

1099
01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:17.040
There's a woman here to see you.

1100
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.320
Hilma.

1101
01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.560
She says she's your sister.

1102
01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:22.120
Oh no.

1103
01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.000
What does she want?

1104
01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.840
She said something
about building a temple.

1105
01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:38.160
I'm sorry.
but Mr. af Klint is asleep.

1106
01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.360
No. I didn't tell him that. did I?

1107
01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.680
Did I tell him that?

1108
01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.480
No.

1109
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.320
Stop. Stop!

1110
01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:13.080
Don't burn them!

1111
01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.360
Stop!

1112
01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.000
Stop!

1113
01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:36.880
Hermina.

1114
01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:50.520
Where have you been?

1115
01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.920
I've been here all the time.

1116
01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:58.360
I've been looking for you.

1117
01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:00.440
Well. you found me.

1118
01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:04.760
I found you.

1119
01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.920
Did you burn them yet?

1120
01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:45.280
My paintings?

1121
01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:47.200
Did you burn them yet?

1122
01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:48.960
No.

1123
01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.080
I couldn't. I wouldn't.

1124
01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:02.560
Good.

1125
01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:05.560
20 years.

1126
01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:12.240
Give it 20 years...

1127
01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:17.240
20 years. what?

1128
01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.840
Hide them. Hide them.

1129
01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:27.200
Until you find my temple.

1130
01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:35.080
-20 years.
-20 years.

1131
01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:46.360
One...

1132
01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:49.920
two...

1133
01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:54.120
three...

1134
01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:57.320
four...

1135
01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:00.760
five...

1136
01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:02.840
six...

1137
01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:05.080
seven...

1138
01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:07.680
eight.

1139
01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:09.440
nine...

1140
01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.920
19...

1141
01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:18.800
20.

1142
01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:32.680
20!

1143
01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.120
I can see it.

1144
01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.600
The light.

1145
01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:19.240
There's no light on earth
to describe it.

1146
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.320
The truth is
Hilma af Klint tells us that her art

1147
01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:40.000
isn't abstract imaginations.

1148
01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:42.960
She painted what she saw

1149
01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:45.840
and what the spirits
guided her to paint.

1150
01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:49.840
So these are actually
observations of spiritual life.

1151
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.000
And nobody believed her. of course.

1152
01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:56.440
So she painted for us.
who would believe.

1153
01:46:56.560 --> 01:47:00.040
For the future
and for the temple she envisioned.

1154
01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.720
Ready or not...

1155
01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:43.240
here I come.

1156
