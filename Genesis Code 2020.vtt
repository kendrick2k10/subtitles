[light dramatic music]

4
00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:49.049
- [David] Abby. why?

5
00:00:49.136 --> 00:00:51.877
Speak to me. Abby. why
are you doing this to me?

6
00:00:51.964 --> 00:00:54.445
What do you want from me?

7
00:00:54.532 --> 00:00:55.359
Abby!

8
00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:59.233
- [Woman] David. David. David.

00:01:00.364 --> 00:01:03.367
[branches crunching]

10
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.248
- You want me?

11
00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:15.727
Come and get me!

12
00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:18.513
[dramatic music]

13
00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:58.466
- [Man] What if we knew
that was God was real?

14
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.688
[door creaking]

[light music]
[Abby laughing]

17
00:02:40.856 --> 00:02:43.380
- [Man] Wake up. David.

18
00:02:43.467 --> 00:02:45.643
It's time to get moving.

19
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.123
- [Woman] David.

20
00:02:53.434 --> 00:02:56.088
- [David] Abby. I dreamt
about you again last night.

21
00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:59.744
It's day 75 and I'm no
closer to figuring out

22
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:01.703
what happened to you.

23
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.662
They continue to point their
finger at me and say I did it.

24
00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:08.318
and with Charlie missing. I
can't convince them otherwise.

25
00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:10.407
It's easy for them
to blame me. though.

26
00:03:10.494 --> 00:03:12.366
It makes sense.

27
00:03:12.453 --> 00:03:15.630
They say you two were having
an affair. but this is a lie.

28
00:03:15.717 --> 00:03:16.544
It has to be.

29
00:03:19.982 --> 00:03:21.026
They don't know me.

30
00:03:22.506 --> 00:03:24.116
and they certainly
don't know you.

31
00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:34.605
As they press me and I
deal with their antics.

32
00:03:34.692 --> 00:03:37.260
attempts to break me
and force me to crack.

33
00:03:37.347 --> 00:03:40.002
I rely on my abilities to
put the pieces together

34
00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.003
and figure it out.

35
00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:46.704
There are moments though.
where I see myself falling into

36
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:49.794
a dark abyss so deep. that
eventually it will be impossible

37
00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:53.581
to find my way back.
and as the light fades.

38
00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:55.539
I feel the darkness consume me.

39
00:03:58.325 --> 00:04:00.283
[radio chiming]

40
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.765
- [Announcer] Conspiracy Radio.

41
00:04:03.852 --> 00:04:06.158
- [Jimmy] Let me
get this straight.

42
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:09.988
the Devil is very much alive
and he's living amongst us?

43
00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:12.948
- [Perez] Well. that
depends on your perspective.

44
00:04:13.035 --> 00:04:15.646
- [Jimmy] Oh that's
such a crock. though.

45
00:04:15.733 --> 00:04:18.258
I mean don't you think. I
mean this spiritual battle.

46
00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:22.087
a fight between good
and evil. God. Creation.

47
00:04:22.174 --> 00:04:24.829
Don't you think that this
is just a ploy against us

48
00:04:24.916 --> 00:04:26.657
that's set up by
organized religion?

49
00:04:26.744 --> 00:04:28.964
- [Perez] I'm not about
organized religion.

50
00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:32.707
Um. I am completely about
something different. Mr. Jones.

51
00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:36.406
- [Jimmy] Anyway. well first
off. Jimmy. just call me Jimmy.

52
00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:38.016
And also I hope
I didn't come off

53
00:04:38.103 --> 00:04:39.757
like I was antagonizing you.

54
00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:41.106
I am just really
curious about this

55
00:04:41.193 --> 00:04:42.630
fight between good and evil.

56
00:04:42.717 --> 00:04:44.371
and it seems very
black and white to me.

57
00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:47.243
- [Perez] No. what you or
I cannot deny that there

58
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.506
is good and evil in this world.

59
00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:52.901
There is light and
there is darkness.

60
00:04:52.988 --> 00:04:56.774
In between. there
is nothing else.

61
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:58.298
It's either or.

62
00:04:58.385 --> 00:05:00.212
We as a human race
continue to ignore this

63
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.086
and have convinced
ourselves of this gray area.

64
00:05:05.609 --> 00:05:07.481
but that's not the truth.

65
00:05:07.568 --> 00:05:09.221
- [Jimmy] Well that
was very well said

66
00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.660
and I might have a point
to counteract with that.

67
00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:14.488
Let's take a quick
break and listen

68
00:05:14.575 --> 00:05:17.621
to a phenomenal
band Old Man Canyon.

69
00:05:20.145 --> 00:05:21.669
- [David] Perez is right.

70
00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:23.279
There is no gray area.

71
00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:25.281
There only is or isn't.

72
00:05:25.368 --> 00:05:27.762
What we do and what we don't do.

73
00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.112
Take Detective
Parks for instance.

74
00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.724
He sits there and watches
me day after day after day.

75
00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:36.248
like he's expecting
me to slip up.

76
00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.599
Maybe if I was guilty I would.

77
00:05:40.644 --> 00:05:42.994
The only thing I am guilty
of is not telling you

78
00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:45.214
every day how much I love you.

79
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:48.043
Guilty of not doing
enough to keep you safe.

80
00:05:51.742 --> 00:05:54.266
Believe me. I'm doing
everything I can

81
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:58.836
to prove my innocence. but
each day has its challenges.

82
00:05:58.923 --> 00:06:01.448
While the detectives spend
their time playing mind games

83
00:06:01.535 --> 00:06:03.885
and hoping that
eventually I'll break.

84
00:06:03.972 --> 00:06:07.018
I spend my time investigating
the university's involvement.

85
00:06:20.554 --> 00:06:23.905
Say for a moment that you and
Charlie were having an affair.

86
00:06:23.992 --> 00:06:26.560
I don't know if I
would resort to murder.

87
00:06:26.647 --> 00:06:28.083
I have never lifted my hand

88
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.738
to another human
being my entire life.

89
00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:32.696
I don't think I'm
capable of violence.

90
00:06:33.915 --> 00:06:35.351
I have witnessed
enough death in my time

91
00:06:35.438 --> 00:06:37.788
to know that nothing
is solved by it.

92
00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:40.312
- And you didn't know if
anyone was comin' to visit?

93
00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:44.055
How do you think this looks?

94
00:06:47.581 --> 00:06:48.625
Are you admitting it?

95
00:06:51.106 --> 00:06:52.150
- Parks. take a walk.

96
00:06:56.198 --> 00:06:57.721
- You went fishing. right?

97
00:06:58.896 --> 00:06:59.723
You catch anything?

98
00:07:01.638 --> 00:07:04.336
[Parks chuckling]

99
00:07:06.643 --> 00:07:08.819
- Mr. Harris. my
partner's just trying

100
00:07:08.906 --> 00:07:10.821
to put together the pieces.

101
00:07:10.908 --> 00:07:13.302
You say you come back.
there was a broken mug.

102
00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:14.869
The chair is flipped
over and your wife

103
00:07:14.956 --> 00:07:16.871
is no where to be seen.

104
00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.525
So you go out looking for her.

105
00:07:18.612 --> 00:07:20.918
yet you don't call us
for a number of hours.

106
00:07:24.008 --> 00:07:25.793
Now given what you
do for a living.

107
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.447
how do you think that sounds?

108
00:07:27.534 --> 00:07:31.059
- I get it. things happen.
people fall in love.

109
00:07:31.146 --> 00:07:32.843
especially when they
work as close together

110
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.236
like you and Charlie did.

111
00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:37.935
Suggesting you and
Charlie having an affair

112
00:07:38.022 --> 00:07:42.592
is too convenient. too obvious
and not to mention cliche.

113
00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:45.726
But I wonder if people knew
how different you both were.

114
00:07:45.813 --> 00:07:48.076
Sure. maybe you believed
in the same things;

115
00:07:48.163 --> 00:07:50.948
helping others. making a
difference in the world.

116
00:07:51.035 --> 00:07:53.255
not to mention
your faith in God.

117
00:07:53.342 --> 00:07:56.650
And even though you wanted
to accomplish the same thing.

118
00:07:56.737 --> 00:07:58.173
you didn't always
see eye to eye.

119
00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.217
[phone buzzing]

120
00:07:59.304 --> 00:08:01.872
[muffled music]

121
00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.141
Hello. Dad.

122
00:08:10.228 --> 00:08:12.448
- [Henry] Hi. son.

123
00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:14.058
You got me on that
speaker again?

124
00:08:15.451 --> 00:08:17.061
How many times do
I have to tell you?

125
00:08:17.148 --> 00:08:18.236
They may be listening.

126
00:08:21.936 --> 00:08:22.806
- What do you want?

127
00:08:24.068 --> 00:08:25.809
- I wanna know how
you're doing today.

128
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.726
- Just wanted to welcome
- You feel like company?

129
00:08:29.813 --> 00:08:30.901
- [Jimmy] Everyone
back to the program.

130
00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:32.686
- Do I have a choice?

131
00:08:32.773 --> 00:08:34.252
- Of course you do.
- Or if you're just tuning in

132
00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:35.732
we are here with renowned

133
00:08:35.819 --> 00:08:37.212
- Come on.
- Author and Harvard professor

134
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:38.909
Perez Valentino.
- Your mom made brownies.

135
00:08:38.996 --> 00:08:40.955
- [Jimmy] In his five part
series on his new book--

136
00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:44.741
- So I don't have a choice.

137
00:08:44.828 --> 00:08:47.091
As you wish.
- This is about faith.

138
00:08:47.178 --> 00:08:51.269
And I'm really curious about
- Great. see you in an hour.

139
00:08:51.356 --> 00:08:53.968
- [Jimmy] Your opinion
of the afterlife.

140
00:08:56.187 --> 00:08:58.538
- [Perez] I think the essence
of our faith. is love.

141
00:08:59.887 --> 00:09:01.584
I think where we
[light somber music]

142
00:09:01.671 --> 00:09:03.499
fall of the rails is
linked to our faith

143
00:09:03.586 --> 00:09:05.588
and money and material objects;

144
00:09:05.675 --> 00:09:10.593
shoes. cars. televisions.
television devices. T.V. shows.

145
00:09:13.074 --> 00:09:17.513
news. propaganda. and we
get away from our movies--

146
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.123
- [David] Detective Parks
and Gaines are not paying

147
00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.473
close enough attention
to the university

148
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.954
and their involvement
in your death.

149
00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:26.783
They have to know more
than they're letting on.

150
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.350
- [Perez] We. whose
fact of authorities.

151
00:09:28.437 --> 00:09:29.960
- [David] Whatever you
two were working on

152
00:09:30.047 --> 00:09:32.397
caused you to keep
secrets from me.

153
00:09:32.484 --> 00:09:33.877
What was so important
that you felt

154
00:09:33.964 --> 00:09:35.879
that you had to hide it from me?

155
00:09:35.966 --> 00:09:38.012
That you felt you
couldn't say something?

156
00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.103
You don't think I noticed how
on edge you were at times?

157
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.887
Something must have
happened between you

158
00:09:43.974 --> 00:09:46.673
and the board of directors
that made you nervous enough

159
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.979
that you felt you
couldn't talk to me.

160
00:09:49.066 --> 00:09:52.330
If you couldn't trust me.
then who could you trust?

161
00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:55.072
- [Perez] Intuition.

162
00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:56.944
- Hey. I got a package
for a David Harris.

163
00:09:58.075 --> 00:10:01.383
- [Perez] Fly south for
the winter to make warm.

164
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.343
How do they know to fly south
rather than stay. intuition.

165
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.737
It's something that
humans have inside of them

166
00:10:08.956 --> 00:10:09.565
that we've had and
continually had since

167
00:10:11.915 --> 00:10:13.003
the beginning of
time. since existence.

168
00:10:14.048 --> 00:10:16.920
[doorbell ringing]

169
00:10:17.007 --> 00:10:21.098
We deny that fact of the
thing that all tribunes

170
00:10:21.185 --> 00:10:25.363
that modern living has in
the heat of the furnace.

171
00:10:28.105 --> 00:10:29.324
- [Henry] You gotta eat.

172
00:10:31.326 --> 00:10:32.588
- [David] Come on in.

173
00:10:32.675 --> 00:10:34.329
- I wanna whip up
something special.

174
00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:36.723
you wanna invite your
friend in and feed him too?

175
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:37.593
- Let him starve.

176
00:10:39.813 --> 00:10:40.901
- That's not very nice.

177
00:10:42.337 --> 00:10:43.904
- [Jimmy] Convert you.

178
00:10:43.991 --> 00:10:47.081
[muffled radio talking]

179
00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:52.260
- How'd you sleep?

180
00:10:54.262 --> 00:10:56.612
- [David] I don't sleep.

181
00:10:56.699 --> 00:11:00.964
- Your mom sends her
love and brownies.

182
00:11:02.618 --> 00:11:04.185
- How is she doin'?

183
00:11:04.272 --> 00:11:06.013
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

184
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.318
- Your mom's a survivor.

185
00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:11.975
She's not who I'm worried about.

186
00:11:19.156 --> 00:11:20.723
You kids need a father. David.

187
00:11:23.073 --> 00:11:24.248
They're not doin' too good.

188
00:11:26.424 --> 00:11:27.599
This has gone on too long.

189
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:28.992
You need to do something.

190
00:11:30.864 --> 00:11:32.300
- [David] What?

191
00:11:32.387 --> 00:11:34.215
- Do you think I'm
just gonna stand around

192
00:11:34.302 --> 00:11:36.043
and watch you throw
your life away?

193
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.871
That's not gonna happen. bud.

194
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.399
- [David] Tell 'em I love 'em.

195
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.444
- You tell 'em.

196
00:11:47.794 --> 00:11:48.664
That's your job.

197
00:11:49.796 --> 00:11:51.014
That's your sole purpose.

198
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.026
- They're comin' for me. dad.

199
00:12:04.506 --> 00:12:06.813
It's just a matter of
time. but they're comin'.

200
00:12:09.772 --> 00:12:12.209
- I know. Martin
called me this morning.

201
00:12:12.296 --> 00:12:14.037
[David chuckling]

202
00:12:14.124 --> 00:12:15.560
- Is that why you're here?

203
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.044
- Yes and no.

204
00:12:23.438 --> 00:12:25.832
Okay. mostly yes.

205
00:12:27.355 --> 00:12:29.792
But I thought maybe we
could work on this together.

206
00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:30.837
Get it figured out.

207
00:12:31.707 --> 00:12:33.143
We know we don't have much time.

208
00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:37.800
Have you been able to
make any kind of progress?

209
00:12:37.887 --> 00:12:39.193
- None.

210
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.978
I mean. my mind's
not workin' right.

211
00:12:43.284 --> 00:12:44.764
I can't think straight.

212
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:49.290
I mean. I try. I try to
put the pieces together.

213
00:12:49.377 --> 00:12:50.552
but they don't seem to fit.

214
00:12:55.339 --> 00:12:56.079
Maybe they're right.

215
00:12:58.212 --> 00:12:59.256
- What are you saying?

216
00:13:00.997 --> 00:13:01.737
David.

217
00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:03.957
- Maybe it's that simple?

218
00:13:06.263 --> 00:13:08.178
Maybe they were
having an affair.

219
00:13:08.265 --> 00:13:10.659
- Don't you dare.
- What!

220
00:13:10.746 --> 00:13:12.095
It makes sense. doesn't it?

221
00:13:13.314 --> 00:13:15.403
The secret meetings?

222
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.708
Coming home late at night?

223
00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.623
- Enough!

224
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.801
I'm not gonna stand here and
watch you go down that road.

225
00:13:21.888 --> 00:13:23.759
You know what it's like
when you're working

226
00:13:23.846 --> 00:13:25.630
on something that's important.

227
00:13:27.415 --> 00:13:29.460
Abby was a good woman.

228
00:13:29.547 --> 00:13:32.333
Abby was a great wife.

229
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.858
Don't you dare. not
even for a moment.

230
00:13:35.945 --> 00:13:38.426
allow anyone to
sully her reputation.

231
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.780
- What am I gonna do?

232
00:13:44.867 --> 00:13:47.914
[light dramatic music]

233
00:13:48.001 --> 00:13:49.654
- I don't know.

234
00:13:49.741 --> 00:13:52.701
Maybe start at the end.
work your way backwards.

235
00:13:52.788 --> 00:13:57.271
- I've done that over
and over and over again.

236
00:13:59.273 --> 00:14:02.232
- David. you're a bright man.

237
00:14:02.319 --> 00:14:04.539
but you're also very sensitive.

238
00:14:08.064 --> 00:14:09.196
You can't allow your emotions

239
00:14:09.283 --> 00:14:11.763
to control your thought process.

240
00:14:13.374 --> 00:14:15.898
It's like you almost
have to stand outside

241
00:14:15.985 --> 00:14:18.161
of the circumstance
that you're in.

242
00:14:18.248 --> 00:14:22.513
in order to see a bigger.
more global picture.

243
00:14:25.952 --> 00:14:26.735
- I have been.

244
00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:31.305
That's what I don't
think you understand.

245
00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:32.219
I have.

246
00:14:43.534 --> 00:14:45.885
- How do you like your eggs?

247
00:14:48.626 --> 00:14:52.326
We're not gonna be able to
solve this on an empty stomach.

248
00:14:56.634 --> 00:14:59.289
- Scrambled. like my brains.

249
00:15:05.992 --> 00:15:07.210
- But I wanna stay with you.

250
00:15:08.516 --> 00:15:12.215
- [David] Oh. sweetie.
I know. but you can't.

251
00:15:14.348 --> 00:15:15.915
- But you need me.
I can help you.

252
00:15:17.351 --> 00:15:18.918
- [David] Look. I know
that it seems that way.

253
00:15:19.005 --> 00:15:21.094
but daddy just needs to
be alone right now. okay?

254
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.227
Okay?

255
00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:29.798
- [Henry] What. you're
not gonna finish that?

256
00:15:29.885 --> 00:15:30.668
- No. I'm good.

257
00:15:32.105 --> 00:15:33.454
- Well. you hardly touched it.

258
00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:35.673
Come on. you need to eat.

259
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.257
[light dramatic music]

260
00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:02.526
- Charlie.

261
00:16:05.007 --> 00:16:08.576
He had a brilliant mind and
he had this ability to see

262
00:16:08.663 --> 00:16:11.840
things from a different
perspective. beyond science.

263
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.800
There was something
special about him.

264
00:16:17.324 --> 00:16:19.543
He had all these theories
on life's creation.

265
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.502
He told me he wanted
to scientifically

266
00:16:21.589 --> 00:16:23.721
prove that God was real.

267
00:16:23.808 --> 00:16:26.550
Said it would end all
war. can you believe it?

268
00:16:26.637 --> 00:16:27.551
- You gotta go.

269
00:16:29.075 --> 00:16:31.468
- Hm. what?

270
00:16:31.555 --> 00:16:33.949
- [David] Lock the
door on your way out.

271
00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:35.298
- What. David?

272
00:16:40.477 --> 00:16:43.002
[door slamming]

273
00:16:45.656 --> 00:16:48.703
- If Charlie's alive
and gone into hiding.

274
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.097
then I'm gonna need some
help to draw him out.

275
00:16:57.625 --> 00:16:58.495
You hungry?

276
00:17:06.242 --> 00:17:08.810
Come on. let me make
you something to eat.

277
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:13.467
Why aren't you guys
looking for Charlie?

278
00:17:13.554 --> 00:17:14.511
- Oh. we are.

279
00:17:14.598 --> 00:17:15.904
Around the clock.

280
00:17:17.993 --> 00:17:19.342
Where did you hide the body?

281
00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:25.174
[David chuckling]

282
00:17:25.261 --> 00:17:26.828
- Oh. you guys
don't quit. do you?

283
00:17:28.395 --> 00:17:29.526
I didn't kill my wife.

284
00:17:29.613 --> 00:17:31.050
I didn't kill Charlie.

285
00:17:31.137 --> 00:17:32.442
- Keep tellin' yourself that.

286
00:17:34.662 --> 00:17:39.580
- You know. your insults.
they're not gonna work on me.

287
00:17:39.667 --> 00:17:41.451
- Ah. that's right.
you know the game.

288
00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:47.066
- [David] So why aren't
you looking for him?

289
00:17:48.676 --> 00:17:51.244
- Mr. Harris--
- David. call me David.

290
00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:56.423
- Mr. Harris. I'm not
here to be your friend.

291
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:57.424
I'm here in pursuit
of the truth.

292
00:17:57.511 --> 00:17:58.425
- [David] Me. too.

293
00:17:58.512 --> 00:18:01.384
[Parks groaning]

294
00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:03.125
All right.

295
00:18:04.648 --> 00:18:06.128
I'll talk. you listen.

296
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.526
So we know that Abby
and Charlie were working

297
00:18:12.613 --> 00:18:14.702
on something groundbreaking
for the university.

298
00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:17.705
- We looked into that.

299
00:18:17.792 --> 00:18:22.013
- [David] I know. but it
must have been so big that

300
00:18:22.927 --> 00:18:24.190
the university got scared

301
00:18:24.277 --> 00:18:25.408
and they needed to
put a lid on it.

302
00:18:26.322 --> 00:18:28.019
- Go on.

303
00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:30.674
- [David] See. if we could.
if we could find out what

304
00:18:30.761 --> 00:18:32.633
it was they discovered.
then we could figure out

305
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.592
who killed Abby. who
really killed her

306
00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:37.507
and we can draw
Charlie out of hiding.

307
00:18:40.249 --> 00:18:41.859
- Yeah. Gaines
warned me about you.

308
00:18:43.034 --> 00:18:45.036
Said you were too smart
for your own good.

309
00:18:47.082 --> 00:18:50.259
We talked to everyone we
needed to at the university.

310
00:18:50.346 --> 00:18:53.175
They said Charlie quit. they
have his resignation letter

311
00:18:53.262 --> 00:18:55.351
so you can toss that
theory right out the door--

312
00:18:55.438 --> 00:18:57.005
- [David] They're lying.

313
00:18:57.092 --> 00:18:58.833
Anyone can fabricate a letter.

314
00:18:59.747 --> 00:19:01.357
You know that.

315
00:19:01.444 --> 00:19:03.925
- You've been cooped up
in here way too long.

316
00:19:04.012 --> 00:19:05.274
Hasn't done you any good.

317
00:19:07.537 --> 00:19:09.409
- Its given me time;

318
00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:12.194
time to think and put
the pieces together.

319
00:19:12.281 --> 00:19:14.631
I'm on to something here.
and you need to go back

320
00:19:14.718 --> 00:19:16.851
to the university and
you need to look harder.

321
00:19:16.938 --> 00:19:20.550
- Mr. Harris. you're
starting to panic

322
00:19:20.637 --> 00:19:22.726
because you realize the
truth is about to come out.

323
00:19:22.813 --> 00:19:25.294
So all of this. I get.

324
00:19:27.557 --> 00:19:30.865
- [David] If Charlie's
dead. then where's his body?

325
00:19:30.952 --> 00:19:32.736
- I don't know. you tell me.

326
00:19:32.823 --> 00:19:34.303
- [David] I don't know!

327
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.087
- I don't believe you.

328
00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.525
You read a lot of
conspiracy books.

329
00:19:38.612 --> 00:19:39.526
I've even caught that
station you listen

330
00:19:39.613 --> 00:19:41.180
to when I've come in here.

331
00:19:41.267 --> 00:19:42.790
- [David] It's on just
for background noise.

332
00:19:42.877 --> 00:19:44.705
- Yeah. right. but you've
been here a long time.

333
00:19:44.792 --> 00:19:47.490
and that doesn't do someone
in your condition any good.

334
00:19:52.756 --> 00:19:53.670
It's sad.

335
00:19:55.716 --> 00:19:56.978
I think a psychologist
would call this

336
00:19:57.065 --> 00:19:58.458
post traumatic syndrome.

337
00:19:59.807 --> 00:20:01.722
You know. a lot of
the vets coming back

338
00:20:01.809 --> 00:20:03.071
from the war have it.

339
00:20:04.725 --> 00:20:07.380
'Cause killing someone is
not an easy thing to do.

340
00:20:08.729 --> 00:20:11.035
Killing two. that
must be even harder.

341
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:19.870
[fist thudding]
[suspenseful music]

342
00:20:38.628 --> 00:20:41.240
[dramatic music]

343
00:20:57.778 --> 00:20:58.474
- Abby?

344
00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:26.633
Abby?

345
00:21:38.122 --> 00:21:40.995
[muffled whispers]

346
00:21:51.875 --> 00:21:53.007
Abby?

347
00:21:53.094 --> 00:21:53.834
Abby?

348
00:21:57.185 --> 00:21:58.621
Abby. wait.

349
00:22:16.944 --> 00:22:18.075
- [Gaines] Parks. you there?

350
00:22:18.162 --> 00:22:20.426
If you're there. Parks. pick up.

351
00:22:20.513 --> 00:22:22.645
Hey. Parks. I got
coffee. pick up.

352
00:22:22.732 --> 00:22:23.690
We're still waiting
on the warrant.

353
00:22:23.777 --> 00:22:26.040
so do not go inside.

354
00:22:26.127 --> 00:22:29.086
[suspenseful music]

355
00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.194
- [Parks] Yeah.
you're in for it now.

356
00:22:51.892 --> 00:22:53.372
What are you gonna do. run?

357
00:22:58.855 --> 00:23:02.685
- You try explaining this
one to your superiors.

358
00:23:09.257 --> 00:23:11.955
[dramatic music]

359
00:23:24.533 --> 00:23:27.667
[door slamming]

360
00:23:27.754 --> 00:23:31.714
[knocking on door]
- Mr. Harris.

361
00:23:32.976 --> 00:23:34.064
Mr. Harris. open the door.

362
00:23:37.328 --> 00:23:40.549
[tapping on glass]

363
00:23:40.636 --> 00:23:42.943
Come on. let's talk.

364
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.816
Hey. where's Parks?

365
00:23:46.903 --> 00:23:49.515
Open the door. Mr. Harris.

366
00:23:49.602 --> 00:23:54.520
Can you open the door?
[dramatic music]

367
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:04.181
- Hey. he went
out the back door!

368
00:24:24.941 --> 00:24:25.681
- Mr. Harris.

369
00:24:27.857 --> 00:24:28.902
Get off the fence.

370
00:24:28.989 --> 00:24:30.294
Get down.

371
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:31.252
Get off the fence.

372
00:24:32.383 --> 00:24:34.298
David. get down. come on.

373
00:24:34.385 --> 00:24:36.475
David. don't run.

374
00:24:36.562 --> 00:24:37.345
David.

375
00:25:08.245 --> 00:25:09.072
- He took my gun.

376
00:25:10.683 --> 00:25:11.466
- Seriously?

377
00:25:14.295 --> 00:25:15.296
[key clanging]

378
00:25:15.383 --> 00:25:16.340
What the hell happened?

379
00:25:19.953 --> 00:25:21.781
- I didn't think
he had it in him.

380
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.219
- Well apparently. he
did. what'd you say?

381
00:25:29.136 --> 00:25:29.919
Jeez. let me do that.

382
00:25:31.051 --> 00:25:31.834
- I'm right handed.

383
00:25:34.968 --> 00:25:36.099
- Yeah. we'll call it in.

384
00:25:38.101 --> 00:25:39.146
Here. leave that on.

385
00:25:52.899 --> 00:25:54.161
- Hi. Mr. Harris.
- Hi.

386
00:25:54.248 --> 00:25:55.945
- It's good to see you.

387
00:25:56.032 --> 00:25:57.817
- You too.

388
00:25:57.904 --> 00:25:58.948
- Tea. water?

389
00:25:59.035 --> 00:25:59.862
- Uh.

390
00:26:00.994 --> 00:26:02.473
- Sorry to hear about your wife.

391
00:26:04.127 --> 00:26:05.564
- Thanks.

392
00:26:05.651 --> 00:26:06.956
- Do you want a menu?

393
00:26:07.043 --> 00:26:08.784
- I'm okay right now.

394
00:26:08.871 --> 00:26:10.133
Do you have a phone I can use?

395
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.570
- Yeah. come with me.
- Okay.

396
00:26:24.844 --> 00:26:28.761
Ah. 555-525-5151.

397
00:26:34.201 --> 00:26:34.941
[dramatic music]

398
00:26:35.028 --> 00:26:36.464
What have I done?

399
00:26:36.551 --> 00:26:38.074
This is not good.

400
00:26:38.161 --> 00:26:39.685
I can't believe I hit him.

401
00:26:39.772 --> 00:26:44.690
And you. you're. I saw
your lifeless body.

402
00:26:45.952 --> 00:26:46.909
They found you at the
bottom of a ravine.

403
00:26:48.041 --> 00:26:49.129
Dead people aren't
supposed to appear

404
00:26:49.216 --> 00:26:50.521
in front of you like that.

405
00:26:51.435 --> 00:26:52.915
they're supposed to stay dead.

406
00:26:54.177 --> 00:26:55.352
What's happening to me?

407
00:26:55.439 --> 00:26:57.833
[phone ringing]

408
00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.921
- [Melissa] Harris.
Carter. and McGill.

409
00:26:59.008 --> 00:27:00.096
how can I direct your call?

410
00:27:00.183 --> 00:27:01.707
- Yeah. Martin Carter. please.

411
00:27:03.796 --> 00:27:05.711
- Uh. Mr. Carter is with
some clients right now.

412
00:27:05.798 --> 00:27:07.800
- Melissa. it's me. David.

413
00:27:08.844 --> 00:27:09.976
I need to talk to him.

414
00:27:10.063 --> 00:27:11.020
- Oh. my God. David.

415
00:27:11.107 --> 00:27:12.195
Are you okay?

416
00:27:12.282 --> 00:27:13.022
Stay on the line.

417
00:27:20.073 --> 00:27:21.944
[sighs]

418
00:27:29.691 --> 00:27:32.259
[phone ringing]

419
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:39.353
- David. where the hell are you?

420
00:27:40.702 --> 00:27:41.921
- I can't say.

421
00:27:42.008 --> 00:27:43.400
- Of course you can.

422
00:27:43.487 --> 00:27:45.054
Tell me where you are.
I'll come get you.

423
00:27:45.141 --> 00:27:48.231
- No. Martin. no.

424
00:27:48.318 --> 00:27:49.102
- David.

425
00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:52.192
David. this isn't
how we do things.

426
00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:53.149
You know that.

427
00:27:53.236 --> 00:27:54.324
- I saw her. Martin.

428
00:27:54.411 --> 00:27:55.151
- [Martin] You saw who. David?

429
00:27:55.238 --> 00:27:56.022
- I saw Abby.

430
00:28:02.115 --> 00:28:03.072
- All right.

431
00:28:05.248 --> 00:28:05.988
All right. buddy.

432
00:28:08.643 --> 00:28:09.426
Let me help you.

433
00:28:12.908 --> 00:28:13.996
Now tell me where you are.

434
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.829
[dial tone buzzing]

435
00:28:26.356 --> 00:28:29.403
[phone beeping]

436
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.404
Henry. it's Martin.

437
00:28:31.666 --> 00:28:33.015
We have a problem.

438
00:28:35.365 --> 00:28:37.759
[door slamming]

439
00:28:37.846 --> 00:28:38.804
- [Man] Two. please.

440
00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.025
- [David] Those
two. who are they?

441
00:28:43.112 --> 00:28:46.942
They aren't FBI
or CIA or the mob.

442
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:50.119
That pin. they're
with the school.

443
00:28:50.206 --> 00:28:51.773
That's it.

444
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.471
They're sending people
after me. aren't they?

445
00:28:54.558 --> 00:28:56.560
And I can't believe
I told Martin.

446
00:28:56.647 --> 00:28:58.301
That wasn't very smart.

447
00:28:58.388 --> 00:29:01.043
He's crazy if he thinks
I'm gonna turn myself in.

448
00:29:03.219 --> 00:29:04.525
- [Man] What's he doing?

449
00:29:04.612 --> 00:29:05.787
- Writing. he's writing.

450
00:29:07.571 --> 00:29:08.877
- [Man] Anything else?

451
00:29:08.964 --> 00:29:10.357
- [David] I have
to watch myself.

452
00:29:10.444 --> 00:29:12.185
Every move I make
has to be calculated.

453
00:29:12.272 --> 00:29:14.187
- [Man] Nobody else is with him?

454
00:29:14.274 --> 00:29:15.057
- By himself.

455
00:29:15.144 --> 00:29:16.667
Single plate.

456
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:18.278
- [David] What kinda
trouble were you in. Abby?

457
00:29:18.365 --> 00:29:19.627
What do they want with me?

458
00:29:19.714 --> 00:29:21.455
- Would you like a refill?

459
00:29:21.542 --> 00:29:23.936
Are you sure you don't
want a second cup?

460
00:29:24.023 --> 00:29:24.763
It's free.

461
00:29:27.113 --> 00:29:29.115
[giggling]

462
00:29:36.165 --> 00:29:37.123
[snapping]

463
00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:37.950
- Mr. Harris?

464
00:29:39.473 --> 00:29:41.257
Mr. Harris?

465
00:29:41.344 --> 00:29:43.825
You zoned out
there for a second.

466
00:29:43.912 --> 00:29:45.305
You okay?

467
00:29:45.392 --> 00:29:47.089
You sure you don't
want something to eat?

468
00:29:47.176 --> 00:29:51.528
Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris.
[suspenseful music]

469
00:29:58.884 --> 00:30:02.104
[light dramatic music]

470
00:30:31.568 --> 00:30:33.179
- [Henry] Chloe. come on inside.

471
00:30:33.266 --> 00:30:35.094
It's time to eat.

472
00:30:35.181 --> 00:30:36.922
Come on in. let's
get washed up. hon.

473
00:30:45.104 --> 00:30:47.541
[somber music]

474
00:31:17.397 --> 00:31:18.137
- Abby?

475
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.889
Abby?

476
00:33:04.547 --> 00:33:07.072
[David sighing]

477
00:33:14.166 --> 00:33:15.297
- [Woman] David.

478
00:33:22.609 --> 00:33:24.959
- [Radio] Harris has been
on the run since yesterday.

479
00:33:25.046 --> 00:33:27.396
A warrant for his
arrest has been issued.

480
00:33:27.483 --> 00:33:30.008
Charged with the murder
of his wife. Abby Harris.

481
00:33:30.095 --> 00:33:32.401
and also been linked to the
mysterious disappearance

482
00:33:32.488 --> 00:33:36.362
of her alleged lover. Charlie
Miller. also presumed dead.

483
00:33:36.449 --> 00:33:39.321
Police are asking for your
help in locating the suspect--

484
00:33:39.408 --> 00:33:41.410
- This one's on me.
- Thank you.

485
00:33:41.497 --> 00:33:42.759
- No problem.

486
00:33:42.846 --> 00:33:43.630
- Have a nice day.
- You. as well.

487
00:34:01.604 --> 00:34:02.344
- Put that down.

488
00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:05.826
Here.

489
00:34:13.138 --> 00:34:16.402
You know that this
is not good. right?

490
00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.491
I could get in a lot of
trouble for having you here.

491
00:34:18.578 --> 00:34:19.361
- I know.

492
00:34:22.495 --> 00:34:23.539
I need your help.

493
00:34:23.626 --> 00:34:27.587
[light dramatic music]

494
00:34:27.674 --> 00:34:28.631
- Anything.

495
00:34:28.718 --> 00:34:29.589
What do you need?

496
00:34:33.332 --> 00:34:35.595
- I know this is
gonna sound crazy.

497
00:34:35.682 --> 00:34:36.987
but I need you to believe me.

498
00:34:39.294 --> 00:34:40.861
Abby's appeared to me.

499
00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:41.731
- David.

500
00:34:43.516 --> 00:34:45.561
- I've seen her
with my own eyes.

501
00:34:45.648 --> 00:34:48.390
I know she's dead.
but I saw her.

502
00:34:50.697 --> 00:34:52.264
She's trying to
tell me something.

503
00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:54.614
- David.

504
00:34:58.096 --> 00:35:01.055
You need to listen to
me. not only as a doctor.

505
00:35:01.142 --> 00:35:02.404
but as your friend. okay?

506
00:35:05.973 --> 00:35:08.367
Please don't do
this to yourself.

507
00:35:08.454 --> 00:35:09.150
Please.

508
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.110
Turn yourself in.

509
00:35:12.197 --> 00:35:14.895
Let your father and
Martin do their job.

510
00:35:14.982 --> 00:35:16.462
- I can't.

511
00:35:16.549 --> 00:35:17.463
- [Sofia] What are you gonna do?

512
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.029
- I'm gonna figure it out.

513
00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:21.554
- How are you going
to figure this out?

514
00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:23.947
You have to be realistic.

515
00:35:24.034 --> 00:35:25.297
- I am.

516
00:35:25.384 --> 00:35:26.820
If she's trying to
tell me something.

517
00:35:26.907 --> 00:35:28.126
I need to trust in that.

518
00:35:31.738 --> 00:35:36.438
- Okay. if that's the case.
what is she trying to tell you?

519
00:35:37.352 --> 00:35:38.310
- Well. if I knew.

520
00:35:46.535 --> 00:35:49.190
I need you to think back
to before Abby died.

521
00:35:49.277 --> 00:35:50.757
Did she say anything to you?

522
00:35:50.844 --> 00:35:52.585
Did she give you a
hint with regards

523
00:35:52.672 --> 00:35:54.456
to anything that her and
Charlie were working on?

524
00:35:54.543 --> 00:35:55.457
- No. nothing.

525
00:35:57.372 --> 00:35:59.418
They were very protective
over their work.

526
00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:04.423
Dammit. I wish I could tell
you something. but I can't.

527
00:36:08.035 --> 00:36:09.993
Hey. I miss her. I do.

528
00:36:13.301 --> 00:36:16.217
But this is not the
way to do things.

529
00:36:43.331 --> 00:36:46.639
- You know Abby never did
tell me how that week went.

530
00:36:46.726 --> 00:36:47.770

01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:33.092
And I wish that she
was here with us today.

884
01:07:45.757 --> 01:07:47.367
- Do you think she hid it here?

885
01:07:53.547 --> 01:07:56.159
- That's what she told me.
but I've looked everywhere

886
01:07:56.246 --> 01:08:00.554
and I can't find it.

887
01:08:05.559 --> 01:08:10.521
Sofia told me that Abby appears

888
01:08:11.652 --> 01:08:13.219
to you sometimes in your dreams.

889
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:18.398
Is it true?

890
01:08:21.314 --> 01:08:22.576
David!

891
01:08:22.663 --> 01:08:23.403
- What?

892
01:08:25.536 --> 01:08:26.406
- Is it true?

893
01:08:28.713 --> 01:08:30.280
- I don't wanna talk about it.

894
01:08:32.499 --> 01:08:34.936
- Maybe she's
reaching out to you.

895
01:08:35.023 --> 01:08:37.025
Maybe she's trying to
tell you something.

896
01:08:40.942 --> 01:08:42.770
Come on. David. talk to me.

897
01:08:42.857 --> 01:08:43.728
- [David] I can't.

898
01:08:47.601 --> 01:08:48.559
- [Charlie] Yes. you can.

899
01:08:48.646 --> 01:08:49.560
- No. I can't.

900
01:08:49.647 --> 01:08:51.431
I don't want to.

901
01:08:53.172 --> 01:08:58.046
- Look. I know your views
on the world are different

902
01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.701
from the way Abby
and I saw things.

903
01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.400
When are you gonna let it go?

904
01:09:04.314 --> 01:09:06.142
- I don't know how.

905
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:07.447
- Sure you do.

906
01:09:10.058 --> 01:09:11.147
Everybody does.

907
01:09:17.544 --> 01:09:19.024
- I don't wanna talk to him.

908
01:09:22.419 --> 01:09:26.466
- He's always listenin'.
even when you think he isn't.

909
01:09:28.512 --> 01:09:29.817
He is.

912
01:09:38.391 --> 01:09:39.262
Talk to him. David.

913
01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:42.874
Pray.

914
01:09:45.224 --> 01:09:46.182
Concentrate.

915
01:09:50.664 --> 01:09:51.926
Just concentrate.

916
01:10:10.423 --> 01:10:12.120
- I'm the only
friend you have left.

917
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:30.530
[light dramatic music]

918
01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:57.862
[Abby giggling]

919
01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:07.741
- Yes.

920
01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:09.874
Yes.

921
01:11:28.501 --> 01:11:29.589
- I think I know
where she hid it.

922
01:11:33.463 --> 01:11:35.291
Why is this so important to you?

923
01:11:37.118 --> 01:11:38.381
- I mean. think about it.

924
01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:41.993
You know how the world is.

925
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.169
Look at how we
treat one another.

926
01:11:44.256 --> 01:11:46.345
I mean. having
faith is difficult.

927
01:11:48.434 --> 01:11:50.610
I mean. most people
aren't even capable of it.

928
01:11:50.697 --> 01:11:55.572
I mean. what if we knew. what
if we knew that God was real?

929
01:12:01.186 --> 01:12:02.622
- You really think he cares?

930
01:12:04.102 --> 01:12:05.756
Maybe you're doin'
this for nothing.

931
01:12:07.932 --> 01:12:11.588
- I'm tryin' to do something
good for the world. David.

932
01:12:11.675 --> 01:12:13.590
- And that makes you as bad
as every religious fanatic

933
01:12:13.677 --> 01:12:14.808
I've ever sat with.

934
01:12:21.554 --> 01:12:23.251
- This isn't about
religion. David.

935
01:12:24.296 --> 01:12:25.645
This is about us.

936
01:12:28.735 --> 01:12:31.651
People always say
that religion is bad.

937
01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:35.089
Religion isn't bad.

938
01:12:35.176 --> 01:12:37.788
It's man that makes
religion evil.

939
01:12:37.875 --> 01:12:41.052
The way they teach it. the
way they manipulate it.

940
01:12:41.139 --> 01:12:42.662
the way they benefit from it.

941
01:12:44.795 --> 01:12:48.189
And if I can prove
that God really exists.

942
01:12:51.758 --> 01:12:54.892
then I believe I'm giving
humanity the answers

943
01:12:54.979 --> 01:12:56.154
that it's searching for.

944
01:12:59.505 --> 01:13:00.680
And I hope that one day.

945
01:13:04.075 --> 01:13:08.253
that it'll end war and
pain and suffering.

946
01:13:12.083 --> 01:13:14.520
and give people what they
really deserve; peace.

Dave.

950

Where the hell are we going?

01:14:15.146 --> 01:14:15.929
Dave.

952
01:14:18.715 --> 01:14:19.629

You lying son of a--

956
01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:11.028
- [Charlie] Easy.

957
01:15:11.115 --> 01:15:12.769
- What about me and my family?

958
01:15:14.074 --> 01:15:16.424
- Don't worry. I'll take
care of you. I promise.

959
01:15:18.339 --> 01:15:20.907
We don't know what kinda
evil these people are. David.

960
01:15:22.126 --> 01:15:24.694
What if they'll stop
at nothin'. huh?

961
01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:27.827
Drop it.

962
01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:30.874
Drop it.

Come on.

964
01:15:48.326 --> 01:15:50.720
- It doesn't have
to be this way.

965
01:15:50.807 --> 01:15:53.287
If what you discovered is
true. then let me help you.

966
01:15:57.204 --> 01:15:57.988
- Help me?

967
01:15:59.816 --> 01:16:01.861
You can't help me. David.

968
01:16:05.038 --> 01:16:06.866
I can only help myself.

969
01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:10.478
Now let's go.

[suspenseful music]

971
01:16:58.178 --> 01:16:59.353
- Charlie.

972
01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.530
- Stay back. I won't hesitate.

973
01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:03.967
- This isn't the
way we do things.

974
01:17:04.054 --> 01:17:05.272
- I know how this works.

975
01:17:09.059 --> 01:17:10.190

what you're doing.

You go down this road.
there's no turning back.

980

even think about it.

That's it.

may I call you that?

- Yeah.

- We are deeply
saddened by your loss.

Abby was a wonderful woman.

She did great things
for the university.

990
01:19:06.089 --> 01:19:07.568

red flags that come up.

In that people become upset.

But we must not. that must
not stop us from saying.

- [Jimmy] I think you might
have taken it the wrong way.

I'm not vilifying
God in any way.

Good stuff here.
- Oh this is real?

You believe in this?

- I don't believe
in it. it's just.

it's interesting.
- Crop circles.

and the whole Area 51.
- Just give it a chance.

1007

- When we get there.

- Well. Ben's not quite ready.

be able to explain

to the children what
happened to you.

understand it myself.

will be to let you go.

Ben and for Chloe.

Maybe it's time I gave God
more credit for who he is.

Maybe it's time to start
talkin' to him again.

great as it's written to be.
