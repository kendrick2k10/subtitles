you were the first
girl to ever touch me.

181
00:10:33.046 --> 00:10:36.359
the first girl to ever
really look at me.

182
00:10:38.741 --> 00:10:41.675
You were my first kiss. Sophia.

183
00:10:41.813 --> 00:10:43.712
- Who's Sophia?

184
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.093
I thought I was playing Sophia.

185
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:48.786
- You can never be Sophia.

186
00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:51.754
- What's wrong with you?

187
00:10:51.892 --> 00:10:53.860

188
00:10:55.033 --> 00:10:56.725

[Kevin laughs]

241
00:12:54.808 --> 00:12:57.500
[gentle music]

242
00:13:08.028 --> 00:13:09.271
- It's nice. right?

- You know what. you know what?

250
00:13:27.254 --> 00:13:28.808
I wonder how much
a house like this

251
00:13:28.946 --> 00:13:30.637
in a neighborhood
like this costs?

252
00:13:30.775 --> 00:13:32.777
- Mm. you know. actually. um.

253
00:13:32.915 --> 00:13:35.366
I spoke to the realtor and-
- Kevin!

254
00:13:35.504 --> 00:13:39.094
- Listen. if you want
it. then it's ours.

256
00:13:41.234 --> 00:13:42.856

the stability that you
always asked for. you know.

260
00:13:48.482 --> 00:13:50.001
And I just thought to myself.

261
00:13:50.139 --> 00:13:51.209
why have this big
wedding in a year.

262
00:13:51.347 --> 00:13:52.555
We can have like
a small wedding.

263
00:13:52.693 --> 00:13:54.005
- Yeah.

264
00:13:54.143 --> 00:13:56.042
- And then this
big beautiful crib

265
00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.251
could be the
reception. you know.

266
00:13:58.389 --> 00:14:01.116
- It'll also be
like a housewarming.

267
00:14:01.254 --> 00:14:02.531
- You're so amazing.

268
00:14:02.669 --> 00:14:04.429
- Wait. wait. so

- But I thought you
wanted to live on a ranch.

285
00:14:45.298 --> 00:14:47.093
not some house in the city.

286
00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:49.819

Take a walk with me.

295

She didn't really
mean anything by that.

296
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.151
- Baby. yes. she did.

297
00:15:11.289 --> 00:15:12.704
It's obvious and you know that.

354
00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:36.262
And the three additional
rooms you reserved are back

355
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.195
at the main property.

356
00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:39.334
[Sophia laughs]

357
00:17:39.472 --> 00:17:42.475
- You really went all out. Mel.

358
00:17:42.613 --> 00:17:44.063
- Well. I mean.
it's not every day

359
00:17:44.201 --> 00:17:45.512

gets married. right?

360
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:49.447
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. thank you.

361
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.968
- And thank you for all of this

362
00:17:53.106 --> 00:17:55.281
and I'm sorry I haven't
been doing so great

363
00:17:55.419 --> 00:17:57.352
at keeping in touch.

364
00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.389
- It's all right.
life happens. right?

365
00:18:00.527 --> 00:18:02.909
- Well. I'll leave
you ladies to it.

366
00:18:03.047 --> 00:18:04.600
Enjoy your stay.

367
00:18:04.738 --> 00:18:06.015
If you need anything at all.

368
00:18:06.154 --> 00:18:07.431
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

369
00:18:07.569 --> 00:18:08.777
- [Host] You're welcome.

370
00:18:08.915 --> 00:18:10.054
- [Sophia] Wow.

371
00:18:10.192 --> 00:18:11.745
- Yeah. take it all in.
- Yeah.

372
00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:13.885
- Check this out.
look at this bed.

373
00:18:14.023 --> 00:18:15.370
- [Sophia] Mm.

374
00:18:15.508 --> 00:18:18.235
- Go ahead. feel it. go ahead.

375
00:18:18.373 --> 00:18:19.201
- All right.
- I bet it's soft.

376
00:18:19.339 --> 00:18:20.444
- Okay.

377
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.761
Ooh.
- Uh-huh.

378
00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:30.626
[Sophia laughs]

379
00:18:30.764 --> 00:18:31.938
- So. what's up with
you. what's new?

380
00:18:32.076 --> 00:18:34.113
Are you still in nursing school?

381
00:18:34.251 --> 00:18:35.114
- Girl. I finished
nursing school

382
00:18:35.252 --> 00:18:36.736
before the pandemic.

383
00:18:36.874 --> 00:18:38.047
You know I've been
traveling around

384
00:18:38.186 --> 00:18:39.532
the country with the hospitals.

385
00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:40.878
Yeah. I didn't think it
was gonna pay this much.

386
00:18:41.016 --> 00:18:42.604
but it's given me so much time

387
00:18:42.742 --> 00:18:47.540
that now my big hustle is
making CBD oils for massage.

388
00:18:52.441 --> 00:18:53.960
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

389
00:18:54.892 --> 00:18:57.239
- Wait. you graduated.
- Yeah.

390
00:18:57.377 --> 00:18:59.828
- Congratulations.
I'm sorry. Mel.

391
00:18:59.966 --> 00:19:02.210
- Don't worry about
it. life happens right.

392
00:19:02.348 --> 00:19:03.556
- [Sophia] Yeah.

393
00:19:03.694 --> 00:19:04.902
- Besides. you
clearly been booed up.

394
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.973
- Yeah. but. you know.

395
00:19:08.077 --> 00:19:10.770
I don't mean to miss
out on things with you.

396
00:19:10.908 --> 00:19:12.427
- It's all good.

397
00:19:14.014 --> 00:19:16.948
What happens in three years?

398
00:19:17.086 --> 00:19:18.916
- Dang. it's been that long?

399
00:19:19.054 --> 00:19:20.159
- Mm-hmm.

400
00:19:20.849 --> 00:19:21.746
- Mm.

401
00:19:22.609 --> 00:19:25.233
- Can I. can I say something?

402
00:19:25.371 --> 00:19:26.682
- Yeah. sure.

403
00:19:28.063 --> 00:19:31.273
- I just. I didn't
think you'd end up

404
00:19:31.411 --> 00:19:33.689
with somebody like Kevin.

405
00:19:36.244 --> 00:19:37.624
- Really? Why?

406
00:19:38.694 --> 00:19:40.420
- Sophie. he's boring.

407
00:19:40.558 --> 00:19:43.285
He's everything you always
said you never wanted.

408
00:19:43.423 --> 00:19:45.805
- Okay. Mel. but things change.

409
00:19:45.943 --> 00:19:48.877
He's sweet. he's thoughtful
and he's a great guy.

410
00:19:49.015 --> 00:19:52.432
- And you're spontaneous.
you're adventurous.

411
00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.090
I just wanna make sure
you're not settling.

412
00:19:55.228 --> 00:19:56.540
- Settling?

413
00:19:56.678 --> 00:20:00.337
Listen. I love Kevin
and I'm marrying him.

414
00:20:00.475 --> 00:20:04.858
not because I have to.
but because I want to.

415
00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:06.412
- Okay.

416
00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.551
But does he know about us?

417
00:20:07.689 --> 00:20:10.209
- What? No. there's no us.

418
00:20:11.417 --> 00:20:12.728
- If he doesn't know about us.

419
00:20:12.866 --> 00:20:15.386
then he doesn't
know the real you.

420
00:20:15.524 --> 00:20:17.388
- Yes. he does.

421
00:20:17.526 --> 00:20:20.840
Like what we do.
it's fun. that's it.

422
00:20:22.462 --> 00:20:23.567
- Okay.

423
00:20:26.811 --> 00:20:28.019
If you say so.
- Mm-hmm.

424
00:20:28.157 --> 00:20:29.331
- Mm.
- Yep.

425
00:20:32.334 --> 00:20:34.198
- Yep. smells good. don't it?

426
00:20:34.336 --> 00:20:36.165
- Okay. so massage oils. huh.

427
00:20:36.304 --> 00:20:37.753
- [Mel] Uh-huh.

428
00:20:38.892 --> 00:20:41.067
- And you know how to use them?

429
00:20:41.205 --> 00:20:42.448
- I made it.

430
00:20:43.345 --> 00:20:44.450
- Word.

431
00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:47.038
Let me see.

432
00:20:48.385 --> 00:20:49.524
- [Mel] Oh. you wanna try it.

433
00:20:49.662 --> 00:20:50.663
- I do. let me see.
- Okay.

434
00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:51.802
- Let me see what you got.

435
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.975
- Oh. you wanna see what I got.

436
00:20:53.113 --> 00:20:53.976
- [Sophia] Uh-huh.

437
00:20:54.114 --> 00:20:55.219
- You know what I got.

438
00:20:55.357 --> 00:20:56.807
- Yep.
- Mm-hmm.

439
00:21:02.191 --> 00:21:04.987
[sensual music]

440
00:21:11.684 --> 00:21:14.445
- Everyone's all
checked in their rooms

441
00:21:14.583 --> 00:21:15.653
and the plan is
for us to all meet

442
00:21:15.791 --> 00:21:18.346
for brunch in the morning.

443
00:21:20.002 --> 00:21:21.141
- Okay. cool.

444
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.559
So. you ready for your massage.

445
00:21:24.697 --> 00:21:26.595
- You have no idea.

446
00:21:28.977 --> 00:21:31.773
[sensual music]

447
00:21:50.516 --> 00:21:51.551
- You know it's been a long time

448
00:21:51.689 --> 00:21:54.313
since you felt these hands.

449
00:21:55.383 --> 00:21:56.763
- So sensual.

450
00:21:59.041 --> 00:21:59.904
- Yeah.

451
00:22:00.042 --> 00:22:02.838
[sensual music]

452
00:22:27.035 --> 00:22:29.831
[Sophia laughs]

453
00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:35.871
- Wow. this feels so good.

454
00:22:42.326 --> 00:22:44.570
[Sophia moans]

455
00:22:44.708 --> 00:22:47.952
- I've been told I
have magic hands.

456
00:22:49.091 --> 00:22:51.818
[Sophia moans]

457
00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.758
- Who told you that?
- Somebody.

458
00:23:02.588 --> 00:23:03.761
- Mm. okay.

459
00:23:07.869 --> 00:23:11.044
So. um. where you
sleeping tonight?

460
00:23:13.184 --> 00:23:16.291
- I thought I was
over here with you.

461
00:23:16.429 --> 00:23:18.880
- I need a little bit of space.

462
00:23:19.018 --> 00:23:22.435
But. thank you for
the massage. Mel.

463
00:23:24.333 --> 00:23:25.438
- What?

464
00:23:27.233 --> 00:23:28.165
- Mm-mm.

465
00:23:30.098 --> 00:23:31.893
No. it's time to go.

466
00:23:35.103 --> 00:23:37.139
Go ahead. Mel.
- Really?

467
00:23:37.277 --> 00:23:38.209
- Go!

468
00:23:45.769 --> 00:23:48.634
[gentle music]

469
00:24:01.543 --> 00:24:04.201
[phone rings]

470
00:24:13.866 --> 00:24:15.246
Hey. babe.
- Hey. baby.

471
00:24:15.384 --> 00:24:16.489
- I miss you.

472
00:24:16.627 --> 00:24:18.560
- I miss you. too. baby.

473
00:24:18.698 --> 00:24:19.941
- [Sophia] You
got a few minutes?

474
00:24:20.079 --> 00:24:21.218
- Of course.

475
00:24:21.356 --> 00:24:24.083
[gentle music]

476
00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:35.474
- [Mel] Morning.

477
00:24:35.612 --> 00:24:37.614
- [Sophia] Good morning.

478
00:24:37.752 --> 00:24:39.305
- Well. I got keys
to everybody's room

479
00:24:39.443 --> 00:24:40.927
because I know there's
gonna be a lot of drinking

480
00:24:41.065 --> 00:24:42.481
and I didn't want
to have to worry

481
00:24:42.619 --> 00:24:44.724
about anything on your big day.

482
00:24:44.862 --> 00:24:46.761
- You're so smart.

483
00:24:46.899 --> 00:24:49.902
You always take such
good care of me.

484
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.938
- I know.
- Mm-hmm.

485
00:24:52.939 --> 00:24:54.907
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

486
00:24:55.045 --> 00:24:58.324
- Don't wanna be
late for brunch.

487
00:24:58.462 --> 00:25:02.501
- So. you. um. you think we
should talk about last night?

488
00:25:02.639 --> 00:25:04.226
- Oh. about what?

489
00:25:05.573 --> 00:25:09.300
- [laughs] About the
moment between you and me.

490
00:25:09.438 --> 00:25:11.302
- Right. the massage.

491
00:25:12.441 --> 00:25:13.684
It was nice.

492
00:25:16.756 --> 00:25:19.069
Look. I'm marrying Kevin.

493
00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:22.624
- [scoffs] Okay. so.
you can have a massage

494
00:25:22.762 --> 00:25:26.076
from me. get turned
on and that's it.

495
00:25:27.698 --> 00:25:29.700
- Of course that's it.

496
00:25:29.838 --> 00:25:31.944
We just can't anymore.

497
00:25:33.497 --> 00:25:35.534
- You don't love him.

498
00:25:36.638 --> 00:25:38.226
I know you don't.

499
00:25:39.848 --> 00:25:41.091
- Yes. I do.

500
00:25:44.128 --> 00:25:46.924
- Well. he was the last person
on your mind last night.

501
00:25:47.062 --> 00:25:50.687
- Well. I called him
as soon as I left.

502
00:25:52.171 --> 00:25:55.795
- You mean. after I
gave you a massage.

503
00:25:56.796 --> 00:25:57.901
- Mm-hmm.

504
00:25:59.074 --> 00:26:02.906
See. your hands. they
did something for me.

505
00:26:04.286 --> 00:26:07.980
so I went to go call him
so we could have video sex.

506
00:26:08.118 --> 00:26:10.258
It was great. Mel [laughs].

507
00:26:10.396 --> 00:26:14.573
Felt like we were
young again [laughs].

508
00:26:14.711 --> 00:26:17.679
- Well. at least
one of us got off.

509
00:26:17.817 --> 00:26:23.098
- You were always so good about
introduce me to new stuff.

510
00:26:28.587 --> 00:26:30.554
- We're connected.

511
00:26:30.692 --> 00:26:33.246
We are always
gonna be connected.

512
00:26:33.384 --> 00:26:36.008
- And we'll always
be best friends.

513
00:26:36.146 --> 00:26:38.700
That's never gonna change.

514
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:44.844
Come on. Mel. let's go to
brunch. come on. let's go.

515
00:26:45.949 --> 00:26:47.744
[Sophia laughs]

516
00:26:47.882 --> 00:26:49.193
Come on. Mel.

517
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.265
[all laughing]

518
00:26:52.403 --> 00:26:53.784
- Oh. my gosh.

519
00:26:54.889 --> 00:26:56.856
- So. what's the
agenda for the day?

520
00:26:56.994 --> 00:26:58.824
- Well. we have a
hike after lunch

521
00:26:58.962 --> 00:27:00.411
and then a spa day.
- Ooh.

522
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:04.864
- Then. tonight. we're
going to a strip club.

523
00:27:05.002 --> 00:27:07.315
- A strip club?
- My idea.

524
00:27:08.661 --> 00:27:11.008
- [Lillian] I don't think
anyone is surprised about that.

525
00:27:11.146 --> 00:27:12.907
- That's true. but.
y'all. I don't know

526
00:27:13.045 --> 00:27:15.495
about going to a strip club.

527
00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:17.256
It's not really my thing.

528
00:27:17.394 --> 00:27:19.776
- Girl. it's your
bachelorette party.

529
00:27:19.914 --> 00:27:21.467
A strip club is essential.

530
00:27:21.605 --> 00:27:23.469
- Yeah. I don't know.

531
00:27:24.608 --> 00:27:25.782
- Oh. come on. what do
you think Kevin's doing

532
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.404
at his bachelor party. hmm?

533
00:27:27.542 --> 00:27:29.199
Drinking tea. playing golf?

534
00:27:29.337 --> 00:27:33.306
No. he's being grinded
on by a flock of women.

535
00:27:33.444 --> 00:27:34.929
- Yep.

536
00:27:35.067 --> 00:27:37.276
- Okay. yeah. but Kevin's
not like that. so.

537
00:27:37.414 --> 00:27:39.416
- He's a man. isn't it?

538
00:27:40.348 --> 00:27:41.867
He's got a dick?

539
00:27:43.006 --> 00:27:44.145
Then he's exactly like that.
- Mm-hmm.

540
00:27:44.283 --> 00:27:48.459
- I doubt it. but okay [laughs].

541
00:27:48.597 --> 00:27:50.116
- You know. I gotta say.

542
00:27:50.254 --> 00:27:52.360
I'm just so surprised
that she ended up

543
00:27:52.498 --> 00:27:54.362
with someone like Kevin.

544
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.812
- Hmm. what do you mean?

545
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.642
- I mean. he's not
her usual type.

546
00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.057
- What is her type then?

547
00:28:00.195 --> 00:28:01.680
- Well. in high
school and college.

548
00:28:01.818 --> 00:28:03.716
she liked the bad
guys. you know.

549
00:28:03.854 --> 00:28:07.306
The kind that went for
freedom instead of stability.

550
00:28:07.444 --> 00:28:08.445
- Hmm.
- Mm.

551
00:28:09.757 --> 00:28:10.619
- So. you like 'em dangerous

552
00:28:10.758 --> 00:28:12.725
and full of red flags.

553
00:28:13.864 --> 00:28:16.211
It's okay. I can relate.

554
00:28:16.349 --> 00:28:17.281
- Yeah.

555
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:21.320
- In high school.
her boyfriend. Sam.

556
00:28:21.458 --> 00:28:23.115
he was her first love

557
00:28:23.253 --> 00:28:26.118
and that boy was a handful.

558
00:28:26.256 --> 00:28:27.084
- Hmm.

559
00:28:27.222 --> 00:28:28.396
- Captain of the football team

560
00:28:28.534 --> 00:28:30.329
and his dad was a rancher.

561
00:28:31.433 --> 00:28:33.090
All he ever wanted
was to play in the NFL

562
00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:35.817
and buy a ranch of his own.

563
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.131
- Did he ever play in the NFL?

564
00:28:42.479 --> 00:28:44.412
- He died senior year.

565
00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:48.968
- What? Oh. my God. how?

566
00:28:51.626 --> 00:28:54.077
- He was in a car accident.

567
00:28:57.114 --> 00:28:58.219
- He took a corner too fast

568
00:28:58.357 --> 00:28:59.634
and the whole car just blew up.

569
00:28:59.772 --> 00:29:02.292
- Oh. my God.
- It was awful.

570
00:29:04.156 --> 00:29:06.054
- That is terrible.

571
00:29:09.713 --> 00:29:10.783
I'm sorry.

572
00:29:12.164 --> 00:29:16.513
- Um. it was a long time
ago and I've changed.

573
00:29:16.651 --> 00:29:17.652
You know. Kevin is perfect

574
00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.034
for where my life is headed.

575
00:29:20.172 --> 00:29:23.278
Structured.
consistent. organized.

576
00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:28.421
Exactly what I want for my life.

577
00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:30.699
- And he's hot.
- Yeah. he's cute.

578
00:29:30.838 --> 00:29:31.700
- Too much.

579
00:29:31.839 --> 00:29:33.185
- He is. he's sweet.

580
00:29:33.323 --> 00:29:35.843
- So. how did you
two meet anyways?

581
00:29:36.878 --> 00:29:38.604
- Well. funny enough.
when I started

582
00:29:38.742 --> 00:29:40.019
the firm about 3-1/2 years ago.

583
00:29:40.157 --> 00:29:42.056
Kevin actually worked
for the law office

584
00:29:42.194 --> 00:29:44.230
that was helping us with
all of our paperwork.

585
00:29:44.368 --> 00:29:47.233
- Okay. so. who courted who?

586
00:29:47.371 --> 00:29:50.961
- He did. every day
for about a month.

587
00:29:51.099 --> 00:29:52.031
I finally let him take me out

588
00:29:52.169 --> 00:29:53.481
on like a little date.

589
00:29:53.619 --> 00:29:58.003
- That's so sweet.
- That's cute [laughs].

590
00:29:58.141 --> 00:30:00.384
- So sweet.
- He's great.

591
00:30:02.283 --> 00:30:04.043
- Ladies. do you
need anything else?

592
00:30:04.181 --> 00:30:05.424
- [Together] Shots.

593
00:30:05.562 --> 00:30:07.046

00:31:23.847 --> 00:31:26.574
- Sophie's never mentioned me?

643
00:31:26.712 --> 00:31:27.575
- I'm sure she has.

00:31:27.713 --> 00:31:29.888
I just probably forgot.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.133
You work at the firm. right?

649
00:31:39.276 --> 00:31:40.588

650
00:31:40.726 --> 00:31:43.556
I'm just an accountant
with a fancy title.

651

00:44:10.751 --> 00:44:11.994
- Thank you.

880
00:44:13.961 --> 00:44:16.412
- Damn. this place is dead.

881
00:44:17.793 --> 00:44:20.174
- I know. weird. ain't it?

882
00:44:23.626 --> 00:44:24.731
Thank you.

883
00:44:25.697 --> 00:44:27.699
- The manager wants to see you.

884
00:44:27.837 --> 00:44:28.700
- The manager?

885
00:44:28.838 --> 00:44:29.943
Why?

886
00:44:33.015 --> 00:44:34.568
- Follow me. ladies.

887
00:44:34.706 --> 00:44:37.433
[upbeat music]

888
00:44:40.367 --> 00:44:43.473
- Ladies. come on
in. have a seat.

889
00:44:45.096 --> 00:44:47.408
I heard you guys had a
fun time the other night.

890
00:44:47.546 --> 00:44:49.065
- Uh. yeah. why?

891
00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:53.069
- Well. listen.
have you seen Foxxy?

892
00:44:55.278 --> 00:44:56.624
- Foxxy?

893
00:44:56.763 --> 00:44:58.074
- The dancer that went home

894
00:44:58.212 --> 00:44:59.731
with your friends
the other night.

895
00:44:59.869 --> 00:45:01.906
- No dancers left with us.

896
00:45:02.044 --> 00:45:04.598
- [laughs] That is not true.

897
00:45:04.736 --> 00:45:06.220
How is it. Trixie?

898
00:45:06.358 --> 00:45:08.153
- I took her and a
couple of the others back

899
00:45:08.291 --> 00:45:09.707
to their suite at the villa.

900
00:45:09.845 --> 00:45:12.813
When we woke up. Foxxy was gone.

901
00:45:14.056 --> 00:45:15.298
- We have it all on
security cameras.

902
00:45:15.436 --> 00:45:17.438
- Well. to be
honest. we don't know

903
00:45:17.576 --> 00:45:19.820
which one was Foxxy.

904
00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:21.408
They were all gone this morning.

905
00:45:21.546 --> 00:45:22.858
- So. you haven't
talked to your friends

906
00:45:22.996 --> 00:45:25.515
or you haven't seen them?

907
00:45:25.653 --> 00:45:27.207
- What's this all about anyways?

908
00:45:27.345 --> 00:45:31.280
- Well. Foxxy's one of
our most popular dancers.

909
00:45:31.418 --> 00:45:33.144
She's been here for a long
time. practically family

910
00:45:33.282 --> 00:45:37.527
and tonight is a money night
and no one has seen her.

911
00:45:38.839 --> 00:45:40.013
- So. what?

912
00:45:40.151 --> 00:45:43.499
You think we
kidnapped a stripper?

913
00:45:43.637 --> 00:45:45.052
- No. of course not.

914
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:48.124
Listen. we're just
trying to find answers.

915
00:45:48.262 --> 00:45:50.230
I wanna say thank you.
ladies for your time

916
00:45:50.368 --> 00:45:52.680
and if you see your friends.

917
00:45:52.819 --> 00:45:55.442
have them tell
Foxxy to check in.

918
00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.375
You guys have a nice day.

919
00:45:57.513 --> 00:46:01.517
- This way. ladies. we
can use the back door.

920
00:46:08.144 --> 00:46:10.906
- You lost her. you find her.

921
00:46:20.985 --> 00:46:22.503
- [Lilian] Geez.

922
00:46:23.746 --> 00:46:26.266
- So. that was weird. right?

923
00:46:26.922 --> 00:46:28.440
- Extremely.

924
00:46:28.578 --> 00:46:32.134
- I mean. Sophia.
yeah. I saw her leave

925
00:46:32.272 --> 00:46:35.827
with a dancer. but do you
really think they hooked up?

926
00:46:35.965 --> 00:46:37.553
- There's no way.

927
00:46:38.657 --> 00:46:40.936
What do you think
about Melody. though?

928
00:46:41.074 --> 00:46:42.523
- I don't know. I
haven't really spent

929
00:46:42.661 --> 00:46:44.802
much time around her. why?

930
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.873
- There's something
off about her.

931
00:46:47.011 --> 00:46:48.909
- What do you mean?

932
00:46:50.083 --> 00:46:52.464
- I can see it in her
eyes. she just seems-

933
00:46:52.602 --> 00:46:53.914
- [Rose] Her eyes?

934
00:46:54.052 --> 00:46:57.504
- It's just the way
she stares at Sophia.

935
00:46:57.642 --> 00:46:59.368
- I hadn't noticed.

936
00:47:02.164 --> 00:47:03.510
- This might sound
a little crazy.

937
00:47:03.648 --> 00:47:05.477
but do you think she
could have anything

938
00:47:05.615 --> 00:47:08.722
to do with the missing
dancer from last night?

939
00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.172
- Why would you think that?

940
00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:11.587
- It was the way she
was staring at her

941
00:47:11.725 --> 00:47:13.313
when Sophia was
getting a lap dance.

942
00:47:13.451 --> 00:47:15.280
this morning in the parking lot.

943
00:47:15.418 --> 00:47:17.593
It's just all so awkward.

944
00:47:17.731 --> 00:47:21.493
- I mean. yeah. but
awkward and murderer?

945
00:47:23.012 --> 00:47:24.945
That's a big leap.

946
00:47:25.083 --> 00:47:26.429
And why would she come

947
00:47:26.567 --> 00:47:27.672
to her best friend's
bachelorette party just

948
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:29.916
to kill some random dancer?

949
00:47:30.054 --> 00:47:31.641
Who does that?

950
00:47:31.779 --> 00:47:34.644
- I know. I'm probably
overthinking things.

951
00:47:34.782 --> 00:47:36.060
- Just a little.

952
00:47:36.198 --> 00:47:39.442
[suspenseful music]

953
00:47:46.484 --> 00:47:48.072
- [Sophia] Did you
get Rose's card?

954
00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:50.764
- Yeah. we did. that's
what I came to tell you.

955
00:47:50.902 --> 00:47:52.076
You dropped the key cards

956
00:47:52.214 --> 00:47:55.044
in the strip club parking lot.

957
00:47:56.528 --> 00:47:58.220
- Are you okay?

958
00:47:58.358 --> 00:48:00.981
- Yeah. it's probably nothing.

959
00:48:01.119 --> 00:48:02.500
- Don't do that.

960
00:48:02.638 --> 00:48:04.398
Tell me what's going on?

961
00:48:04.536 --> 00:48:06.021
- Where's Melody?

962
00:48:06.159 --> 00:48:09.403
- She's upstairs
in the shower. why?

963
00:48:10.542 --> 00:48:11.578
- When we were at
the strip club.

964
00:48:11.716 --> 00:48:13.442
we spoke to the manager.

965
00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:14.512
- Okay?

966
00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:18.274
- The dancer that came
back here last night seems

967
00:48:18.412 --> 00:48:20.656
to be missing.
- Missing?

968
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.214
- The manager caught
her on camera leaving

969
00:48:27.352 --> 00:48:30.114
the club with you and Melody.

970
00:48:31.839 --> 00:48:34.566
- I don't even remember
coming back here.

971
00:48:34.704 --> 00:48:40.124
- Did Melody mention a dancer
named Foxxy staying over?

972
00:48:41.263 --> 00:48:43.506
- [Sophia] Honestly.
I can't remember.

973
00:48:46.095 --> 00:48:47.925
- What's going on?

974
00:48:49.374 --> 00:48:52.757
- Did we leave last night
with a dancer named Foxxy?

975
00:48:52.895 --> 00:48:57.520
- I don't know. we left
with a lot of dancers. why?

976
00:48:59.488 --> 00:49:01.731
- The manager pulled Rose
and Lilian inside his office.

977
00:49:01.869 --> 00:49:04.148
He has security footage
of a dancer leaving

978
00:49:04.286 --> 00:49:07.599
with us last night and
he said she's missing.

979
00:49:07.737 --> 00:49:10.878
- It's been like a day. she's
probably sleeping it off.

980
00:49:11.017 --> 00:49:12.708
- [Sophia] Right.

981
00:49:12.846 --> 00:49:13.847
- I don't know.

982
00:49:13.985 --> 00:49:14.952
I got the sense that this is out

983
00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:16.298
of the ordinary for her.

984
00:49:16.436 --> 00:49:18.645
They seemed concerned.

985
00:49:18.783 --> 00:49:20.405
- [Melody] She's a stripper.

986
00:49:20.543 --> 00:49:24.168
I doubt this is the first
time she's going missing.

987
00:49:24.306 --> 00:49:26.066
- I guess.
- Yeah.

988
00:49:29.138 --> 00:49:31.244
- What's the deal with her?

989
00:49:31.382 --> 00:49:32.624
- She's just a
little rough around

990
00:49:32.762 --> 00:49:34.109
the edges sometimes.

991
00:49:34.247 --> 00:49:36.076
We had a tough life.

992
00:49:36.214 --> 00:49:37.215
- How so?

993
00:49:37.353 --> 00:49:40.149
- Her dad. just not a good man.

994
00:49:41.357 --> 00:49:43.221
We'll leave it at that. okay?

995
00:49:43.359 --> 00:49:44.878
- That's awful.

996
00:49:45.016 --> 00:49:47.087
- Yeah. and she's
been there with me

997
00:49:47.225 --> 00:49:50.125
through every major life event.

998
00:49:51.264 --> 00:49:52.990
- [Lilian] I know you
too are close. but just-

999
00:49:53.128 --> 00:49:54.370
- Just what?

1000
00:49:55.509 --> 00:49:57.442
- When I said the
girl is missing.

1001
00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.169
she had no concern. nothing.

1002
00:50:00.307 --> 00:50:01.895
- Okay. why would she?

1003
00:50:02.033 --> 00:50:04.001
- [Lilian] Because she's a
human being. that's what we do.

1004
00:50:04.139 --> 00:50:06.486
- Okay. but do you have concern
when you watch the news?

1005
00:50:06.624 --> 00:50:07.935
- I know you two
are best friends.

1006
00:50:08.074 --> 00:50:09.420
that's what's blinding you.

1007
00:50:09.558 --> 00:50:12.112
There's something up
with her. I can feel it.

1008
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:13.389
- You don't know her

1009
00:50:13.527 --> 00:50:14.977
and you don't even know me.

1010
00:50:15.115 --> 00:50:17.359
- Just be careful around
her. Sophie. please.

1011
00:50:17.497 --> 00:50:19.326
- Look. I told you I'm
done with the conversation.

1012
00:50:19.464 --> 00:50:22.364
And maybe I need to
be careful around you.

1013
00:50:22.502 --> 00:50:24.400
Time for you to go.

1014
00:50:28.404 --> 00:50:31.649
[suspenseful music]

1015
00:50:39.622 --> 00:50:43.212
- So you really think
Melody is dangerous?

1016
00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:44.593
- [Lilian] I don't know.

1017
00:50:44.731 --> 00:50:47.837
I just know
something's not right.

1018
00:50:49.356 --> 00:50:52.497
- All right. well.
look. we're only here

1019
00:50:52.635 --> 00:50:55.983
a little while longer.
let's just stick it out.

1020
00:50:56.122 --> 00:50:59.815
When we leave here. we'll
never have to see her again.

1021
00:50:59.953 --> 00:51:01.058
- I guess.

1022
00:51:02.783 --> 00:51:04.854
- You going to the pool
this late at night?

1023
00:51:04.992 --> 00:51:06.787
- Yeah. the water calms me.

1024
00:51:06.925 --> 00:51:10.446
By product of growing
up on the coast.

1025
00:51:10.584 --> 00:51:11.758
- You need me to go with you?

1026
00:51:11.896 --> 00:51:14.692
- Nah. you can come if you want.

1027
00:51:15.934 --> 00:51:18.316
I won't be much company.

1028
00:51:18.454 --> 00:51:21.699
I just really need
to clear my head.

1029
00:51:22.838 --> 00:51:26.083
- Okay. so I'll just
call it a night then.

1030
00:51:26.221 --> 00:51:27.187
See you at breakfast?

1031
00:51:27.325 --> 00:51:28.637
- Absolutely.

1032
00:51:37.887 --> 00:51:43.307
[water splashes]
[suspenseful music]

1033
00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:02.567
Fuck. Melody.

1034
00:52:02.705 --> 00:52:05.812
- So. you don't trust me. huh?

1035
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:08.332
- That's not what it is.

1036
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:10.920
It's the way you
are with Sophie.

1037
00:52:11.058 --> 00:52:12.991
Something's not right.

1038
00:52:14.165 --> 00:52:17.375
I know you had something
to do with that dancer.

1039
00:52:17.513 --> 00:52:19.136
I could feel it

1040
00:52:19.964 --> 00:52:22.415
and I'm gonna figure it out.

1041
00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:27.213
[Lilian screams]

1042
00:52:27.351 --> 00:52:30.077

[Lilian gasps]

[suspenseful music]

1045
00:53:10.428 --> 00:53:11.705
- I'm excited about dinner.

1046
00:53:11.843 --> 00:53:13.328
I hope that have that
meatloaf they had-

1047
00:53:13.466 --> 00:53:14.467
- Like you.
- Thank you.

1048
00:53:14.605 --> 00:53:15.951
- Ladies. ladies. I'm so sorry.

1049
00:53:16.089 --> 00:53:18.505
I'm afraid that the
restaurant. the pool

1050
00:53:18.643 --> 00:53:21.059
and the workout
facilities are all closed.

1051
00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:22.475
- Why?
- Why?

1052
00:53:22.613 --> 00:53:24.442
- It was due to an
unfortunate accident.

1053
00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.307
- Accident. what
kind of accident?

1054
00:53:27.445 --> 00:53:29.620
- We had an accidental
death in the pool.

1055
00:53:29.758 --> 00:53:32.105
Our techs are just
cleaning up the area.

1056
00:53:32.243 --> 00:53:33.244
- God.

1057
00:53:33.382 --> 00:53:34.383
- Sorry for the inconvenience.

1058
00:53:34.521 --> 00:53:36.316
- Oh. my God. a drowning?

1059
00:53:36.454 --> 00:53:39.146
- Has anybody heard from Lilian?

1060
00:53:39.285 --> 00:53:43.461
- [Rose] Last night. she said
she was going to the. oh. no.

1061
00:53:43.599 --> 00:53:44.876
- No. no. no. could we-
- Ladies.

1062
00:53:45.014 --> 00:53:46.395
- Ladies. please
wait. wait. please.

1063
00:53:46.533 --> 00:53:48.984
We'd like you to step back.

1064
00:53:50.157 --> 00:53:51.573
- What are you talking about?

1065
00:53:51.711 --> 00:53:52.919
What are you talking about?

1066
00:53:53.057 --> 00:53:54.852
[friends scream]

1067
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:58.027
- Ladies. ladies.
ladies. ladies.

1068
00:54:02.722 --> 00:54:04.965
- [Mel] Okay. I got you.

1069
00:54:06.104 --> 00:54:09.142
- I just. I can't
believe she's gone.

1070
00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.938
- [Melody] I know. it's crazy.

1071
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:14.389
She was so nice.

1072
00:54:15.355 --> 00:54:16.805
- You did this.

1073
00:54:16.943 --> 00:54:19.359
- [Kylie] Rose. what
are you talking about?

1074
00:54:19.497 --> 00:54:21.154
- Yeah. what are
you talking about?

1075
00:54:21.292 --> 00:54:24.122
- [Sophia] Rose. you're
being emotional right now.

1076
00:54:24.261 --> 00:54:25.779
- Lilian didn't trust her

1077
00:54:25.917 --> 00:54:28.057
and then the next
day she ends up dead.

1078
00:54:28.195 --> 00:54:29.404
- They said it was an accident.

1079
00:54:29.542 --> 00:54:30.853
- Bullshit.

1080
00:54:30.991 --> 00:54:32.924
- She slipped and
drowned in the pool.

1081
00:54:33.062 --> 00:54:34.650
that's what the
investigator said.

1082
00:54:34.788 --> 00:54:36.549
- You really believe that?

1083
00:54:36.687 --> 00:54:37.964
- I mean. what else
is there to believe?

1084
00:54:38.102 --> 00:54:40.242
- That she did
this. She's crazy.

1085
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:41.692
[Mel laughs]

1086
00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:43.280
That's probably why they
can't find the dancer.

1087
00:54:43.418 --> 00:54:44.488
Psycho bitch.

1088
00:54:44.626 --> 00:54:47.767
- Bitch? I'll show you a bitch.

1089
00:54:47.905 --> 00:54:50.528
- What? You gonna kill me. too?

1090
00:54:50.666 --> 00:54:53.013
- All right. y'all. y'all.
come on. calm. calm down.

1091
00:54:53.151 --> 00:54:56.741
We gotta be together
in this. okay?

1092
00:54:56.879 --> 00:54:59.848
- I can't fuckin' believe y'all.

1093
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.404
- I'll go talk with her.

1094
00:55:09.444 --> 00:55:11.963
- What was that about?

1095
00:55:12.101 --> 00:55:13.482
- I don't know.

1096
00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.347
She better figure it out.

1097
00:55:16.485 --> 00:55:19.937
- She's just
frazzled. we all are.

1098
00:55:20.075 --> 00:55:21.387
- Yeah.

1099
00:55:21.525 --> 00:55:22.940
- We haven't had time
to process anything.

1100
00:55:23.078 --> 00:55:25.011
- Yeah. you're right.

1101
00:55:25.149 --> 00:55:26.978
So. what should we do?

1102
00:55:27.116 --> 00:55:28.739
- Well. the police
asked for us to stay

1103
00:55:28.877 --> 00:55:31.017
a few more days
until they finish

1104
00:55:31.155 --> 00:55:32.812
the full autopsy in case

1105
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:34.986
there were any more questions.

1106
00:55:35.124 --> 00:55:36.471
- Questions?

1107
00:55:36.609 --> 00:55:39.370
They said it was an accident.

1108
00:55:40.682 --> 00:55:42.649
- They did. but Rose
has been really adamant

1109
00:55:42.787 --> 00:55:45.583
about something else
terrible happening.

1110
00:55:45.721 --> 00:55:48.690
so they just wanna double check.

1111
00:55:52.452 --> 00:55:55.075
- Mel. where are you going?

1112
00:55:55.213 --> 00:55:57.871
- It's. you know.
it's been a lot today.

1113
00:55:58.009 --> 00:56:01.530
Your friend attacked
me and people dying.

1114
00:56:01.668 --> 00:56:05.914
I just. I'm gonna take a
walk and clear my head.

1115
00:56:08.123 --> 00:56:11.885
- Mel. just take your
phone just in case.

1116
00:56:15.268 --> 00:56:17.063
- Thanks.
- I get it.

1117
00:56:26.244 --> 00:56:28.833
[Rose cries]

1118
00:56:39.775 --> 00:56:42.675
[phone buzzes]

1119
00:57:05.525 --> 00:57:07.734
- [Guard] Security.

1120
00:57:07.872 --> 00:57:08.942
Hello?

1121
00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.773
- I'd like to
report an incident.

1122
00:57:11.911 --> 00:57:14.154
I have information about
what happened at the pool.

1123
00:57:14.292 --> 00:57:15.708
- [Guard] Ma'am. we're
aware of the incident.

1124
00:57:15.846 --> 00:57:16.847
please stop calling.

1125
00:57:16.985 --> 00:57:18.745
- No. no. no. no. I got a text.

1126
00:57:18.883 --> 00:57:22.128
I got a text and I
have information.

1127
00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:26.684
Hello?

1128
00:57:27.374 --> 00:57:30.619
[suspenseful music]

1129
00:57:34.727 --> 00:57:36.763
I'll go do it myself.

1130
00:57:41.458 --> 00:57:44.322
- It's looking like a dead end.

1131
00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:46.255
I'm gonna keep looking
for about another hour.

1132
00:57:46.393 --> 00:57:50.087
but I don't know.
it's not looking good.

1133
00:57:54.194 --> 00:57:55.610
Okay.

1134
00:57:55.748 --> 00:57:58.992
[suspenseful music]

1135
00:58:14.145 --> 00:58:15.077
Foxxy?

1136
00:58:16.527 --> 00:58:18.184
Is that you?

1137
00:58:18.322 --> 00:58:21.567
[suspenseful music]

1138
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:34.372
- You wanna tell me what that

1139
00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:36.409
was all about earlier?

1140
00:58:36.547 --> 00:58:38.894
- You know what it was about.

1141
00:58:39.032 --> 00:58:41.448
- Why would you think
Melody is some sort of-

1142
00:58:41.587 --> 00:58:43.830
- Psycho? Because she is.

1143
00:58:43.968 --> 00:58:45.867
- She's not. she-
- She killed Lilian.

1144
00:58:46.005 --> 00:58:48.179
- That's not possible. Rose.

1145
00:58:48.317 --> 00:58:49.422
- How do you know?

1146
00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:52.563
- I just know and why would she?

1147
00:58:52.701 --> 00:58:55.393
- That's not good
enough. Sophia.

1148
00:58:55.532 --> 00:58:58.258
- Okay. well. I don't know
what you want from me.

1149
00:58:58.396 --> 00:59:00.019
- I want you to listen.

1150
00:59:00.157 --> 00:59:01.089
- Talk.

1151
00:59:03.091 --> 00:59:05.265
- I've seen the way
she looks at you.

1152
00:59:05.403 --> 00:59:08.096
There's something
you're not telling me.

1153
00:59:08.234 --> 00:59:09.684
- It's nothing.

1154
00:59:11.651 --> 00:59:13.273
Okay.

1155
00:59:13.411 --> 00:59:17.243
Look. Melody and I hooked
up a few times growing up

1156
00:59:17.381 --> 00:59:18.762
and that's it.

1157
00:59:22.179 --> 00:59:24.699
- So. do you think
she's in love with you?

1158
00:59:24.837 --> 00:59:26.632
- What? No. of course not.

1159
00:59:26.770 --> 00:59:28.047
- Think about it.

1160
00:59:28.185 --> 00:59:29.427
It makes sense.

1161
00:59:29.566 --> 00:59:30.877
If she's in love with you.

1162
00:59:31.015 --> 00:59:32.223
she would try to
take out anybody

1163
00:59:32.361 --> 00:59:33.811
that gets in the way.

1164
00:59:33.949 --> 00:59:35.641
- That's ridiculous Rose.

1165
00:59:35.779 --> 00:59:37.090
- Is it. though?

1166
00:59:37.228 --> 00:59:38.471
- Yeah. I mean. I've
known her pretty much

1167
00:59:38.609 --> 00:59:39.886
my whole life.

1168
00:59:40.024 --> 00:59:41.336
She's been there
for every boyfriend.

1169
00:59:41.474 --> 00:59:43.510
every heartbreak. every problem.

1170
00:59:43.649 --> 00:59:44.684
She's always been there

1171
00:59:44.822 --> 00:59:46.721
and she's never hurt anybody.

1172
00:59:46.859 --> 00:59:48.170
- That you know of.

1173
00:59:48.308 --> 00:59:49.931
- I know her heart.

1174
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:51.898
- You also know Lilian.

1175
00:59:52.036 --> 00:59:54.591
She was the most responsible
out of all of us.

1176
00:59:54.729 --> 00:59:56.040
There's no way she would just go

1177
00:59:56.178 --> 00:59:58.733
to the pool drunk
enough to pass out.

1178
00:59:58.871 --> 01:00:00.389
You know that.

1179
01:00:00.527 --> 01:00:03.392
- Okay. yeah. it was
kind of out of character.

1180
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:04.842
- Exactly.

1181
01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.879
- Yeah. but that doesn't
mean I agree with you.

1182
01:00:07.017 --> 01:00:09.951
- Listen. Lilian was telling me

1183
01:00:10.089 --> 01:00:11.711
that she did not trust Melody.

1184
01:00:11.849 --> 01:00:13.817
She didn't like her.
think about that.

1185
01:00:13.955 --> 01:00:17.337
- Listen. Rose. are
you gonna be okay?

1186
01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:20.340
- I really. really need you

1187
01:00:20.478 --> 01:00:23.792
to think about what I'm
saying and be careful.

1188
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:27.175
[suspenseful music]

1189
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:40.533
- Hey.

1190
01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:42.259
- Hey.

1191
01:00:42.397 --> 01:00:44.019
How was your walk?

1192
01:00:44.157 --> 01:00:46.643
- It was good. necessary.

1193
01:00:48.403 --> 01:00:49.991
- Where'd you go?

1194
01:00:51.095 --> 01:00:52.925
- The trails. Why?

1195
01:00:54.961 --> 01:00:57.930
- No reason. I was just curious.

1196
01:01:01.692 --> 01:01:03.625
- Okay. clearly there's
something on your mind.

1197
01:01:03.763 --> 01:01:05.213
so just say it.

1198
01:01:08.975 --> 01:01:11.357
- Are you in love with me?

1199
01:01:12.254 --> 01:01:15.119
- [laughs] What?

1200
01:01:15.948 --> 01:01:17.777
What are you talking about?

1201
01:01:17.915 --> 01:01:19.227
- Rose has this crazy idea

1202
01:01:19.365 --> 01:01:23.127
that you're in love
with me or something.

1203
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:26.406
- Why would that be so crazy?

1204
01:01:26.544 --> 01:01:28.029
- Because we're best friends.

1205
01:01:28.167 --> 01:01:31.584
And. I mean. I do love
you. but not like that.

1206
01:01:31.722 --> 01:01:33.724
- Not like what?

1207
01:01:33.862 --> 01:01:35.899
- Romantically. Yeah.

1208
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:40.179
- Of course. Okay.

1209
01:01:40.317 --> 01:01:42.906
- 'Cause that would be crazy.

1210
01:01:43.044 --> 01:01:45.011
- Yeah. Would.
- Yep.

1211
01:01:49.188 --> 01:01:54.020
- But why is she asking you
if I'm in love with you?

1212
01:01:54.158 --> 01:01:56.229
- Well. Rose has
this crazy notion

1213
01:01:56.367 --> 01:01:58.197
that you're some
weird serial killer

1214
01:01:58.335 --> 01:02:00.268
that's obsessed with me.
- What?

1215
01:02:00.406 --> 01:02:02.649
- Yeah. she thinks that
you're out to kill anybody

1216
01:02:02.788 --> 01:02:04.375
who gets between you and I

1217
01:02:04.513 --> 01:02:07.068
and that's why she
thinks you killed Lilian.

1218
01:02:07.206 --> 01:02:08.794
- So. she still thinks
I killed that girl.

1219
01:02:08.932 --> 01:02:10.002
- Yeah. yeah. I know.

1220
01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.141
I told her it's impossible.

1221
01:02:11.279 --> 01:02:12.936
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1222
01:02:13.074 --> 01:02:16.387
- But I do have
something to ask you.

1223
01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:19.805
- What?

1224
01:02:20.978 --> 01:02:23.912
- The night Lilian died.
you weren't in the room.

1225
01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:25.776
I woke up and went
to the bathroom

1226
01:02:25.914 --> 01:02:27.744
and you weren't there.

1227
01:02:27.882 --> 01:02:29.331
Where were you?

1228
01:02:30.091 --> 01:02:31.471
- I couldn't sleep.

1229
01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:33.266
I went for a walk.

1230
01:02:34.198 --> 01:02:36.304
- Did you hurt Lilian?

1231
01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:39.031
- What?

1232
01:02:39.169 --> 01:02:40.515
How could you even ask
me something like that?

1233
01:02:40.653 --> 01:02:41.827
- I know-
- What is wrong with you?

1234
01:02:41.965 --> 01:02:43.518
- I know it's stupid. I'm sorry.

1235
01:02:43.656 --> 01:02:45.106
- Really. so you think I'm
just out here killing people.

1236
01:02:45.244 --> 01:02:46.797
- No. no. of course
not. I'm sorry.

1237
01:02:46.935 --> 01:02:48.626
- I cannot even
believe you would. why?

1238
01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:50.490
- Rose is obsessed.

1239
01:02:50.628 --> 01:02:54.322
She's been harassing
the villa security.

1240
01:02:56.807 --> 01:02:58.740
I'm sorry. Mel.

1241
01:02:58.878 --> 01:03:00.224
I know. I'm sorry.

1242
01:03:00.362 --> 01:03:02.537
It's been a hell of
a day. so I'm just.

1243
01:03:02.675 --> 01:03:04.366
- Yeah. tell me about it.

1244
01:03:04.504 --> 01:03:06.713
- Get in the hot tub.

1246
01:04:12.538 --> 01:04:13.470
- Melody?

1247
01:04:16.473 --> 01:04:17.992
- Rose. I swear.

1248
01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.409
It's not what it looks like.

1249
01:04:21.547 --> 01:04:22.617
- I knew it.

1250
01:04:24.343 --> 01:04:26.310
And now I get proof.

1251
01:04:31.074 --> 01:04:33.559
- You should've stayed
out of it. Rose.

Hello?

[suspenseful music]

1262
01:05:57.091 --> 01:05:58.333
- [Mel] Hey.

1263
01:06:00.646 --> 01:06:01.958
- Hey.

1264
01:06:02.096 --> 01:06:04.581
- I just wanted
to stay I'm sorry

1265
01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:08.723
for the way I blew up.

1266
01:06:10.104 --> 01:06:12.140
- God. what happened?

1267
01:06:13.624 --> 01:06:14.556
- What?

1268
01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:18.491
Oh. I was on my walk again

1269
01:06:19.665 --> 01:06:21.425
and there was this
rock on the ground

1270
01:06:21.563 --> 01:06:23.220
and then I tripped
over it and fell

1271
01:06:23.358 --> 01:06:25.498
and hurt myself. so stupid.

1272
01:06:25.636 --> 01:06:28.743
- You've always
been a big clumsy.

1273
01:06:30.607 --> 01:06:31.711
- Thanks.

1274
01:06:31.849 --> 01:06:32.989
- Remember in high school

1275
01:06:33.127 --> 01:06:34.576
when Anna Saunders dared you

1276
01:06:34.714 --> 01:06:36.544
to break into that
abandoned house in Van Nuys.

1277
01:06:36.682 --> 01:06:37.959
- Oh. my God. of course.

1278
01:06:38.097 --> 01:06:39.409
and I thought I was
some super agent

1279
01:06:39.547 --> 01:06:41.100
and I tried to bust
through the window

1280
01:06:41.238 --> 01:06:42.515
with my elbow.

1281
01:06:42.653 --> 01:06:44.034
- Oh. man. you
had so many pieces

1282
01:06:44.172 --> 01:06:45.415
of glass hanging
out of your arm.

1283
01:06:45.553 --> 01:06:47.072
I never seen so much blood.

1284
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:48.452
- I had like 12 or 13 stitches.

1285

- Uh-huh.

1286
01:06:51.455 --> 01:06:54.458
- We've really been
through a lot together.

1287
01:06:54.596 --> 01:06:57.151
- Yeah. we certainly have.

1288
01:06:59.118 --> 01:07:01.086
- Two peas in a pod.

1289
01:07:03.122 --> 01:07:04.813
- I'm sorry about earlier.

1290
01:07:04.951 --> 01:07:06.781
- Don't worry about it.

1291
01:07:06.919 --> 01:07:11.096
- You always know how
to make me feel better.

1292
01:07:16.066 --> 01:07:18.172
Hey. sleepyhead.
- Hey.

1293
01:07:20.933 --> 01:07:22.486
- What are you doing up?

1294
01:07:22.624 --> 01:07:26.835
- I'm gonna go check on
Rose real quick. that's all.

1295
01:07:26.973 --> 01:07:28.078
- Why?

1296
01:07:29.183 --> 01:07:31.219
- She was a little
raw last night

1297
01:07:31.357 --> 01:07:33.394
and she's not responding
to any of my texts.

1298
01:07:33.532 --> 01:07:35.499
so I'm a little worried.

1299
01:07:35.637 --> 01:07:37.501
- She's probably ignoring you.

1300
01:07:37.639 --> 01:07:41.436
- Maybe. but she also
hasn't been on socials today

1301
01:07:41.574 --> 01:07:42.782
and you know that's her world.

1302
01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.232
so that's a little weird.

1303
01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:45.682
- Oh. my God. you
are not her mother.

1304
01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.235
- Okay. but those
girls helped make me

1305
01:07:47.373 --> 01:07:48.409
who I am. Mel.

1306
01:07:48.547 --> 01:07:51.101
They helped build my firm.

1307
01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.861
- Whatever.

1308
01:07:54.035 --> 01:07:55.519
Can you please just
get back in the bed?

1309
01:07:55.657 --> 01:07:58.246
- Look. I'm gonna
go check on Rose

1310
01:07:58.384 --> 01:08:00.731
and when I come back
we can go to breakfast

1311
01:08:00.869 --> 01:08:02.112
if you want.

1312
01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:06.185
- I'm not hungry.
just do your thing.

1313
01:08:16.816 --> 01:08:19.680
[birds chirping]

1314
01:08:23.408 --> 01:08:25.825
- Rose. Rose. are you okay?

1315
01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:29.243
Hello?

1316
01:08:34.971 --> 01:08:35.973
Have you seen Rose?

1317
01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.423
- No. not since last night.

1318
01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.252
I mean. I was just
coming to check on her.

1319
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:40.529
- Yeah. she's not
taking any of my calls

1320
01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:42.359
and I'm starting to get worried.

1321
01:08:42.497 --> 01:08:44.706
- Well. I'm sure she's fine.

1322
01:08:44.844 --> 01:08:46.950
I mean. obviously
she was really close

1323
01:08:47.087 --> 01:08:49.194
with Lilian. so she
took her death hard.

1324
01:08:49.332 --> 01:08:51.886
- Yeah. and the whole
blow up with Melody.

1325
01:08:52.024 --> 01:08:54.026
- Yeah. that was something else.

1326
01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:55.303
Where is Melody anyways?

1327
01:08:55.441 --> 01:08:57.408
- She decided to sleep in

1328
01:08:57.546 --> 01:08:58.893
and I wanna call Kevin.

1329
01:08:59.031 --> 01:09:00.895
but I wouldn't even
know where to start.

1330
01:09:01.033 --> 01:09:02.276
- Wanna go grab breakfast?

1331
01:09:02.413 --> 01:09:03.587
- Um. sure.

1332
01:09:14.702 --> 01:09:18.015
I can't help but be
worried about Rose.

1333
01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:21.709
- Yeah. she was definitely
having a hard time.

1334
01:09:21.846 --> 01:09:23.987
She didn't seem sad.

1335
01:09:24.125 --> 01:09:27.093
She seemed angry and motivated.

1336
01:09:27.232 --> 01:09:29.198
- Yeah. I saw her later

1337
01:09:29.337 --> 01:09:30.613
and she had this crazy notion

1338
01:09:30.752 --> 01:09:32.546
that Melody was
some sort of killer.

1339
01:09:32.685 --> 01:09:35.205
- Yeah. she was
definitely adamant

1340
01:09:35.343 --> 01:09:38.725
that Melody was
behind Lilian's death.

1341
01:09:42.764 --> 01:09:46.665
- I just. I just wish
everybody would get along.

1342
01:09:46.803 --> 01:09:49.011
especially considering
everything going on right now.

1343
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:51.979
- Could I ask you something?

1344
01:09:52.118 --> 01:09:53.430
- Yeah. sure.

1345
01:09:54.811 --> 01:09:57.814
- How come none of us
knew about Melody before?

1346
01:09:57.952 --> 01:09:59.367
- What do you mean?

1347
01:09:59.505 --> 01:10:02.232
- Come on Sophia. we've
all worked side by side

1348
01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:03.647
for three years.

1349
01:10:03.785 --> 01:10:06.823
but you never once
mentioned her.

1350
01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:11.690
- Honestly. I don't know.

1351
01:10:11.828 --> 01:10:15.901
I mean. I guess I just
had so much going on

1352
01:10:16.039 --> 01:10:18.317
and even more in my
mind that time just kind

1353
01:10:18.455 --> 01:10:20.112
of slipped away.

1354
01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:22.873
- That makes sense. I guess.

1355
01:10:23.011 --> 01:10:24.668
It's just strange.

1356
01:10:26.981 --> 01:10:28.500
- Strange how?

1357
01:10:28.638 --> 01:10:30.812
- For three years without
her. your life grew.

1358
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:34.195
business. friends.
relationships.

1359
01:10:34.333 --> 01:10:36.680
Everything went perfect.

1360
01:10:36.818 --> 01:10:41.237
She's back into the picture
and now all of this.

1361
01:10:41.961 --> 01:10:42.962
- So. what?

1362
01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.101
What you're saying she's evil

1363
01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.517
or some sort of bad omen?

1364
01:10:45.655 --> 01:10:48.347
- No. that's not what
I'm saying at all.

1365
01:10:48.485 --> 01:10:50.798
What I'm saying
is our souls know

1366
01:10:50.936 --> 01:10:53.076
what kind of energy
we need in our lives

1367
01:10:53.214 --> 01:10:54.284
and when our souls thrive

1368
01:10:54.422 --> 01:10:55.665
in the absence of another.

1369
01:10:55.803 --> 01:10:59.945
but dims in their
presence. that's a sign.

1370
01:11:00.083 --> 01:11:01.602
- I wouldn't say that.

1371
01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.742
I mean. she was really
important to me growing up.

1372
01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:06.365
She still is really important.

1373
01:11:06.503 --> 01:11:08.712
- Well. I can't speak for you.

1374
01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:11.715
I can only tell you what I see.

1375
01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:15.409
- Okay.

1376
01:11:19.447 --> 01:11:22.243
- Still nothing from Rose?

1377
01:11:22.381 --> 01:11:23.762
- No. nothing.

1378
01:11:25.764 --> 01:11:27.731
- What should we do?

1379
01:11:28.836 --> 01:11:31.079
- Don't you have an
extra set of room keys?

1380
01:11:31.217 --> 01:11:35.429
- Oh. yeah. I found
their spare key cards.

1381
01:11:35.567 --> 01:11:38.017
- Let's go check her room.

1382
01:11:38.155 --> 01:11:41.400
[suspenseful music]

1383
01:11:44.576 --> 01:11:47.441
Do you think she's really gone.

1384
01:11:47.579 --> 01:11:50.409
- Looks like it. goodness.

1385
01:11:50.547 --> 01:11:52.135
Oh. well. she left a note.

1386
01:11:52.273 --> 01:11:54.517
- All her stuff is gone.

1387
01:11:55.966 --> 01:11:57.623
- I couldn't stay
in the same place

1388
01:11:57.761 --> 01:11:59.453
where Lilian died.

1389
01:11:59.591 --> 01:12:03.111
I'm sorry for any trouble
that I caused. Rose.

1390
01:12:03.249 --> 01:12:05.079
- What? What the hell.

1391
01:12:05.217 --> 01:12:07.702
That seems a little strange

1392
01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.084
because Rose is
fiery and last night

1393
01:12:10.222 --> 01:12:13.156
she was not runaway sad.
she was ready to fight.

1394
01:12:13.294 --> 01:12:14.399
- True.

1395
01:12:15.572 --> 01:12:18.126
I mean. but all of
her stuff is gone.

1396
01:12:18.264 --> 01:12:21.095
- Maybe someone from the
security office saw her leave.

1397
01:12:21.233 --> 01:12:22.096
- Let's go check.

1398
01:12:22.234 --> 01:12:23.580
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1399
01:12:26.894 --> 01:12:28.378
- Hi. good afternoon. ladies.

- Our friend. Rose.

is gone from her room and
she left a note saying

1402
01:12:31.726 --> 01:12:33.418
that she's checking out.

1403
01:12:33.556 --> 01:12:34.867
Do you know if she left?

1404
01:12:35.005 --> 01:12:36.524
- I mean. if she left a note.

1405
01:12:36.662 --> 01:12:39.734
she probably left. yes.
you could just call her.

1406
01:12:39.872 --> 01:12:41.460
- She's not answering her phone.

1407
01:12:41.598 --> 01:12:43.428
- Could you just look and see
if she checked out. please.

1408
01:12:43.566 --> 01:12:45.671
- Yeah. of course. who's name
was the room booked under?

1409
01:12:45.809 --> 01:12:47.086
- [Sophia] It's under mine.

1410
01:12:47.224 --> 01:12:49.503
- Can I see your ID. please?
- Sure.

1411
01:12:49.641 --> 01:12:51.090
- Thanks.

1412
01:12:51.228 --> 01:12:54.473
[suspenseful music]

1413
01:12:55.647 --> 01:12:56.993
There's no record of
anyone checking out

1414
01:12:57.131 --> 01:12:59.513
of any of the rooms
listed under your name.

1415
01:12:59.651 --> 01:13:00.962
- That's weird.

1416
01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.688
- Did you happen to
see a woman check out

1417
01:13:02.826 --> 01:13:03.965
at all late last night?

1418
01:13:04.103 --> 01:13:04.932
- I didn't.

1419
01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:06.865
- I didn't work last night. no.

1420
01:13:07.003 --> 01:13:09.108
The guy who did. he'll be
in around 8 p.m. tonight.

1421
01:13:09.246 --> 01:13:10.627
You can ask him. though.

1422
01:13:10.765 --> 01:13:11.904
- Okay. thank you.

1423
01:13:12.042 --> 01:13:13.699
Come on. let's go.

1424
01:13:16.771 --> 01:13:19.084
- Still nothing?
- Nothing.

1425
01:13:19.222 --> 01:13:20.292
- Maybe her phone died.

1426
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:22.328
- Come on. you know her.

1427
01:13:22.467 --> 01:13:23.916
She lives on that thing.

1428
01:13:24.054 --> 01:13:26.263
She has backup chargers
for her backup chargers.

1429
01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:28.162
- So. she's either ignoring us

1430
01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:31.407
or something bad
has happened to her.

1431
01:13:31.545 --> 01:13:33.961
- Something bad has
happened to who?

1432
01:13:34.099 --> 01:13:35.376
- Rose.

1433
01:13:35.514 --> 01:13:36.964
She's missing.

1434
01:13:37.102 --> 01:13:38.862
- Yeah. she's not
answering her phone.

1435
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.933
- She's probably still asleep.

1436
01:13:41.071 --> 01:13:43.073
- Well. Kylie had
extra room keys.

1437
01:13:43.211 --> 01:13:45.213
so we checked and all
her luggage is gone.

1438
01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:47.802
- Yeah. the only thing
she left was note.

1439
01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.632
- What'd the note say?

1440
01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:51.599
- She said she was leaving early

1441
01:13:51.737 --> 01:13:55.154
and she's sorry for
any trouble she caused.

1442
01:13:55.292 --> 01:13:58.054
- Well. that seems pretty
straightforward to me.

1443
01:13:58.192 --> 01:13:59.987
- No. the front
desk has no record

1444
01:14:00.125 --> 01:14:01.954
of her checking out.

1445
01:14:02.092 --> 01:14:03.922
- Well. if she left at night.

1446
01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:06.131
nobody would see
her checking out.

1447
01:14:06.269 --> 01:14:07.373
- You don't know Rose.

1448
01:14:07.512 --> 01:14:09.168
This isn't like her at all.

1449
01:14:09.306 --> 01:14:11.170
- Okay. y'all. that's enough.

1450
01:14:11.308 --> 01:14:14.864
Speculating isn't
gonna help anything.

1451
01:14:21.318 --> 01:14:22.872
- Good evening.
ladies. can I help you?

1452
01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:25.081
- Yes. were you working
here last night. sir?

1453
01:14:25.219 --> 01:14:26.220
- [Guard] Yes. yes.

1454
01:14:26.358 --> 01:14:27.877
- We're looking for our friend.

1455
01:14:28.015 --> 01:14:29.292
She left us a note saying
she was checking out

1456
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:30.914
and now we just can't
get a hold of her.

1457
01:14:31.052 --> 01:14:32.226
- Okay. well. I can
check the records here

1458
01:14:32.364 --> 01:14:33.365
and see if she checked out.

1459
01:14:33.503 --> 01:14:34.849
- Oh. we did that last night

1460
01:14:34.987 --> 01:14:36.299
and the clerk said
there's no record.

1461
01:14:36.437 --> 01:14:38.266
We were just wondering
maybe you saw something.

1462
01:14:38.404 --> 01:14:40.027
- I don't recall seeing anything

1463
01:14:40.165 --> 01:14:41.787
or remember anyone
checking out last night

1464
01:14:41.925 --> 01:14:45.032
on my shift. but-
[phone buzzes]

1465
01:14:45.170 --> 01:14:46.654
- Excuse me. did someone
turn in a cell phone?

1466
01:14:46.792 --> 01:14:48.138
I just dialed our
friend's number

1467
01:14:48.276 --> 01:14:49.761
and there's ringing
coming from the office.

1468
01:14:49.899 --> 01:14:50.796
- Oh. yeah. yeah.
yeah. a hiker found one

1469
01:14:50.934 --> 01:14:52.280
on the trail by the villa.

1470
01:14:52.418 --> 01:14:53.765
He turned it in.

1471
01:14:53.903 --> 01:14:55.249
We're charging it so
people can track it.

1472
01:14:55.387 --> 01:14:56.492
- [Kylie] Okay. when
was it turned in. when?

1473
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:58.459
- It was early this morning.

1474
01:14:58.597 --> 01:15:00.323
- [Sophia] Can we
have it. please?

1475
01:15:00.461 --> 01:15:02.014
- Yeah. yeah. sure.

1476
01:15:02.152 --> 01:15:05.086
- Perfect. shit.
what's her birthday.

1477
01:15:05.224 --> 01:15:06.950
- October 22. 1994.

1478
01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:10.091
- That's not it.

1479
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:12.197
Any other significant
event dates

1480
01:15:12.335 --> 01:15:13.612
or favorite numbers.

1481
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:16.960
- Her mom died. I
think. April 4. 2021.

1482
01:15:20.619 --> 01:15:22.034
- [Sophia] That's not it either.

1483
01:15:22.172 --> 01:15:23.760
- Hey. try 96551.

1484
01:15:25.624 --> 01:15:27.212
- Shit. I'm locked out.

1485
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:28.834
- You're certain that it was
found outside the resort?

1486
01:15:28.972 --> 01:15:30.422
- Oh. that's what
the gentleman told me

1487
01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.872
who turned it in.

1488
01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:32.735
- We need to go out
there and look around.

1489
01:15:32.873 --> 01:15:33.874
- We have to go.

1490
01:15:34.012 --> 01:15:35.013
- Now. now. it's not really safe

1491
01:15:35.151 --> 01:15:36.324
out there at night. ladies.

1492
01:15:36.462 --> 01:15:39.327
Tell you what. I'll go out there

1493
01:15:39.465 --> 01:15:40.708
with you. okay?
- Okay.

1494
01:15:40.846 --> 01:15:41.709
- Thank you.
- Thank you. sir.

1495
01:15:41.847 --> 01:15:45.023
[friends chattering]

1496
01:15:47.094 --> 01:15:49.337
- Go for Marrero.
- Copy.

1497
01:15:50.684 --> 01:15:51.995
- Hey. keep an eye
on the front desk.

1498
01:15:52.133 --> 01:15:54.584
I'm gonna go search
the perimeter.

1499
01:15:54.722 --> 01:15:56.241
- [Marrero] Roger that.

1500
01:15:56.379 --> 01:15:58.208
- Okay. let's
search the area here

1501
01:15:58.346 --> 01:16:00.763
and see if there's any
sign of Rose. okay?

1502
01:16:00.901 --> 01:16:02.385
- I think we should split up.

1503
01:16:02.523 --> 01:16:04.801
- Sophia. you go with
the security guard.

1504
01:16:04.939 --> 01:16:07.079
I'll go with Kylie.

1505
01:16:07.217 --> 01:16:08.046
- Okay.

1506
01:16:08.184 --> 01:16:10.738
- Everybody okay with that?

1507
01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.362
- Yeah.
- Okay. okay.

1508
01:16:18.263 --> 01:16:18.988
[suspenseful music]

1509
01:16:19.126 --> 01:16:20.610
- After you.

1510
01:16:20.748 --> 01:16:23.993
[suspenseful music]

1511
01:16:31.483 --> 01:16:32.588
- Rose?

1512
01:16:34.486 --> 01:16:35.763
Rose?

1513
01:16:35.901 --> 01:16:37.731
Are you out there?

1514
01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:40.665
Are you seeing anything?

1515
01:16:40.803 --> 01:16:42.149
Okay. well. I'm
just gonna backtrack

1516
01:16:42.287 --> 01:16:45.221
and try and cover where
we haven't been yet.

1517
01:16:45.359 --> 01:16:48.604
[suspenseful music]

1518
01:16:56.577 --> 01:17:00.788
Oh. my God. Rose. Rose [cries].

1519
01:17:01.513 --> 01:17:04.896
Rose. wake up [cries].

1520
01:17:10.004 --> 01:17:12.835
[Kylie grunts]

1521
01:17:16.977 --> 01:17:19.842
[Kylie screams]

1522
01:17:29.714 --> 01:17:31.232
[Kylie gurgles]

1523
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:34.028
[neck cracks]

1524
01:17:54.877 --> 01:17:55.981
- Rose!

1525
01:17:58.535 --> 01:18:00.261
You recognize this?

1526
01:18:01.469 --> 01:18:03.195
- I've never seen it.

1527
01:18:03.333 --> 01:18:06.371
but that's definitely
not Rose's.

1528
01:18:07.786 --> 01:18:10.409
- Yeah. there's something
weird going on out here.

1529
01:18:10.547 --> 01:18:12.411
something real weird.

1530
01:18:15.069 --> 01:18:16.726
Hey. Marrero.
- What's up?

1531
01:18:16.864 --> 01:18:18.279
- I'm a need you to
get down here quick

1532
01:18:18.417 --> 01:18:21.489
by the old Oak grove.
- On the way.

1533
01:18:22.663 --> 01:18:25.562
[suspenseful music]

1534
01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:28.013
- Does that look strange?

1535
01:18:29.428 --> 01:18:34.364
- It looks like the ground's
been turned over or something.

1536
01:18:35.503 --> 01:18:38.852
Maybe somebody buried
something. I don't know.

1537
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:42.269
[suspenseful music]

1538
01:18:42.407 --> 01:18:43.270
Oh. Jesus.

1539
01:18:43.408 --> 01:18:46.273
[Sophia screams]

1540
01:18:48.206 --> 01:18:50.518
Hey. is that your friend?

1541
01:18:51.899 --> 01:18:55.282
- No. it looks like the
dancer from the strip club.

1542
01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.560
- The dancer from
the strip club.

1543
01:18:57.698 --> 01:18:59.044
- It's a long story.
- Okay.

1544
01:18:59.182 --> 01:19:01.253
- All right. look. we
need to call the cops.

1545
01:19:01.391 --> 01:19:02.807
Come on. let's get outta here.

1546
01:19:02.945 --> 01:19:03.946
- Oh. my God.
- Let's get outta here.

1547
01:19:04.084 --> 01:19:05.085
- Oh. my God.
- Come on.

1548
01:19:05.223 --> 01:19:06.017
- Come on.
- Oh. my God.

1549
01:19:06.155 --> 01:19:07.397
- [Guard] Come on.

1550
01:19:10.228 --> 01:19:11.505
We're gonna call the police.

1551
01:19:11.643 --> 01:19:14.025
- I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

1552
01:19:14.163 --> 01:19:16.924
- Melody. what are you doing?

1553
01:19:18.823 --> 01:19:20.479
- I'm sorry. baby.

1554
01:19:21.549 --> 01:19:24.414
I wish things could've
been different.

1555
01:19:24.552 --> 01:19:25.795
I really do.

1556
01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:29.143
- All this was you? Why?

1557
01:19:31.594 --> 01:19:33.458
- I did this for you.

1558
01:19:34.459 --> 01:19:35.978
For us.

1559
01:19:36.116 --> 01:19:38.739
- Us. why do you keep.
what are you talking about?

1560
01:19:38.877 --> 01:19:41.328
- Sophie. you're in denial.

1561
01:19:42.467 --> 01:19:43.917
You're trapped.

1562
01:19:45.021 --> 01:19:46.402
Don't you see?

1563
01:19:47.817 --> 01:19:52.097
They wouldn't let us be
together. all of them.

1564
01:19:53.409 --> 01:19:57.344
Your friends. your
fiance. the stupid whore.

1565
01:19:59.173 --> 01:20:02.004
They don't care about you.

1566
01:20:02.142 --> 01:20:04.420
They're using you.

1567
01:20:04.558 --> 01:20:06.284
I'm protecting you.

1568
01:20:07.112 --> 01:20:09.459
- Protecting me? From what?

1569
01:20:10.495 --> 01:20:13.532
- Sophie. you've
always loved me.

1570
01:20:16.121 --> 01:20:18.917
They just wouldn't
let you say it.

1571
01:20:19.055 --> 01:20:21.782
They never allowed
us to be together.

1572
01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.577
