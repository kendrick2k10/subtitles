3
00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:41.791
(loud rock music playing...)

4
00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.833
My family doesn't need me.

5
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.418
We can run away together.

6
00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:08.336
you and I.

7
00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:11.297
My family doesn't need me.

8
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.258
We can run away together.

9
00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.175
you and I.

10
00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:17.220
I can give you the moon

11
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.430
and all the stars. baby.

12
00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.057
Sounds like a promise

13
00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:22.142
he won't keep.

14
00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.311
Hey. Pen.

15
00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:34.445
I can see that you're ready.

16
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.531
I am.

17
00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:38.616
And?

18
00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.785
And what?

19
00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.955
Do you like how I look?

20
00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:46.791
You look great.

21
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.001
You look great.

22
00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:49.961
I'm almost finished
with the second act.

23
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.754
I'm really close.

24
00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:54.924
Can we just be a little late?

25
00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.142
No. we can’t just
be a little late.

26
00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:09.022
You know what?

27
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.231
Just do what you want.

28
00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.192
I don't even care.

29
00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.029
Pen?

30
00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:18.198
Penny?

31
00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:18.823
No!

32
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:22.785
Penelope?

33
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.792
Can you at least turn
that music down?

34
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.170
Please?

35
00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:52.774
I told you I was almost ready.

36
00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:55.485
And. we're still in

37
00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:56.778
time for the show.

38
00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:01.866
You see?

39
00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:04.494
There's no need to get

40
00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.162
your panties all in a bunch.

41
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.251
Albie. we’re supposed to

42
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.544
actually get out and do
something fun tonight.

43
00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.630
That's what you promised

44
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.800
Doing this is fun. isn’t it?

45
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.304
I didn't drop the
kids off for this.

46
00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:27.684
Can we get going?

47
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:29.894
Okay.

48
00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:30.853
Okay.

49
00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.230
I know you don't
want to be late.

50
00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:33.856
Don’t worry.

51
00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:39.195
There's more where
that came from later.

52
00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:41.614
Can't wait.

53
00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:43.241
Let's go.

54
00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:56.170
Can’t we change that light
out with a more dim light?

55
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.922
It’s so ugly.

56
00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:00.550
I don't know.

57
00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:02.969
Aren’t men supposed
to do these things?

58
00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.762
Are you a man. Albie?

59
00:05:06.764 --> 00:05:07.932
You know I'm a man.

60
00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.018
I’m the man.

61
00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:23.406
How long you think he’s had
those paint swatches up

62
00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.198
on his house?

63
00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:25.908
I don't know.

64
00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:27.535
Does it really matter?

65
00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:29.370
Just wondering if
he's ever going to

66
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.830
paint the damn thing.

67
00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:33.791
Well. I don't know if you
realize. but we actually

68
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:36.085
have a lot of paintwork to
do on our own house. so.

69
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.255
Well. we just moved in.

70
00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.176
You'd think he'd try to
do a little bit better.

71
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.637
Well. we can't all write
award winning films

72
00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:47.722
like you Al.

73
00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:49.724
It's a shame.

74
00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:56.856
Hey. you two.

75
00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:57.648
Geez...

76
00:05:58.232 --> 00:05:59.400
Hey. Mark.

77
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.401
Hi.

78
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.279
How are you enjoying
your new home?

79
00:06:03.821 --> 00:06:04.781
-Yeah. it’s.
-Oh. yeah.

80
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:05.615
We. We love it.

81
00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:06.366
It's great.

82
00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.037
We were just discussing

83
00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.413
how pleasant it is to

84
00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:13.790
have you as our neighbor.

85
00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:14.957
Wonderful.

86
00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:16.918
So nice to have you

87
00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:18.419
as my new neighbors.

88
00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:22.340
Oh. well. we just love
being your neighbors.

89
00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.054
Ever since Mary passed.

90
00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:37.355
Well. it's just nice to
have life next door.

91
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.066
It's just nice

92
00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:42.527
to be alive.

93
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.827
Well. we don't want to
be late for the opera

94
00:06:52.453 --> 00:06:53.371
We'll see you soon.

95
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:53.788
Okay.

96
00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:54.414
Bye. bye.

97
00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:01.629
Albie!

98
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.217
Do you think he heard

99
00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.051
what you said?

100
00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:07.927
I don't know.

101
00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:10.471
He’s such a freaking weirdo.

102
00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:11.806
Albie.

103
00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:13.391
He's still waving

104
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:15.810
Geez.

105
00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.491
Longest party line ever.

106
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.200
or what?

107
00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:15.453
I was on the phone with my
mom for your information.

108
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.370
Oh. yeah?

109
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.164
And what makes you
so happy about that?

110
00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:21.250
She said we can just pick
the kids up in the morning.

111
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.001
if we want.

112
00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:24.545
Slap me.

113
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:25.880
I must be dreaming.

114
00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:27.507
You are not.

115
00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:29.217
That means...

116
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.676
no little brats

117
00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.803
climbing into our bed in
the middle of the night?

118
00:08:33.095 --> 00:08:34.972
Little brats that you love.

119
00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:43.606
Wait.

120
00:08:43.814 --> 00:08:44.649
So...

121
00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.859
What can we possibly do

122
00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:48.069
with the house all alone

123
00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.111
to ourselves for the rest

124
00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:49.654
of the night?

125
00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:53.032
Well. I was thinking

126
00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:56.244
maybe we could have
a couple drinks and

127
00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.246
then you could finish
what you started in

128
00:08:58.246 --> 00:08:59.580
the dining room earlier.

129
00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:03.125
Who are you and what have
you done with my wife?

130
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.419
I can just call my mom
and tell her--

131
00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:06.754
No. no. no. no. no.

132
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:08.839
I like the other idea better.

133
00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.341
Well. let's go.

134
00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:11.259
Giddy up. cowboy.

135
00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.009
I'm gettin’.

136
00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:12.885
I'm gettin’.

137
00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.266
And you better make it good.

138
00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.269
You know I will.

139
00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:36.158
Good old Hollywood...

140
00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.704
I love spending my days

141
00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:41.622
staring at brake lights.

142
00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:43.874
Livin’ the dream.

143
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:46.294
Well hey...

144
00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:47.878
At least you’re looking

145
00:09:47.878 --> 00:09:48.796
at the bright side.

146
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.506
Oh. really?

147
00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:52.008
Couldn’t detect the hint

148
00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:53.009
of sarcasm there?

149
00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:56.137
No. like you're actually

150
00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:57.555
looking at the bright side.

151
00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:02.685
Brake lights.

152
00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:04.312
bright side...

153
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.065
Thank you.

154
00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:09.525
I’ll be here all week.

155
00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:20.328
It was three years ago.

156
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.083
Are you writing out loud again?

157
00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:28.794
The award you were
talking about earlier.

158
00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:34.717
There hasn't really been
anything successful since.

159
00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:38.095
Who knows what's gonna
happen with the agency

160
00:10:38.095 --> 00:10:39.430
if this one doesn't land...

161
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:44.226
We might as well just
pack up and move

162
00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:45.603
back to Idaho now.

163
00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:47.271
And what?

164
00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:50.024
Take over your dad's
garage when he retires?

165
00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:53.486
Yeah. with all of my
mechanic skills.

166
00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:55.237
You’re gonna be just fine.

167
00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:56.739
Besides. you can't give up.

168
00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:59.033
We still have to fulfill
our dream of you

169
00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:02.078
writing and me starring in an
Oscar winning film together.

170
00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:05.081
That’s still the dream. huh?

171
00:11:06.415 --> 00:11:07.291
Why not?

172
00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:10.252
I'm not gonna be a stay-
at-home mom forever.

173
00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.554
Don't worry.

174
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.348
I know you.

175
00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:24.308
Some weird little thing is

176
00:11:24.308 --> 00:11:25.726
gonna happen to you tonight.

177
00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:27.395
and then you're gonna
to get this big idea

178
00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.396
and it’s gonna be like

179
00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:29.605
the best thing ever

180
00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:30.523
in your script.

181
00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:34.902
Well. I’m waiting with
open arms for that

182
00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:36.779
weird little thing.

183
00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:03.514
What are you thinking about?

184
00:12:07.184 --> 00:12:07.977
Do you think we should just--

185
00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:08.894
[Tire popping]

186
00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:09.562
Holy shit!

187
00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:10.312
Oh my God!

188
00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:11.772
Pull over!

189
00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:12.606
Okay.

190

Okay. I am.

191
00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:33.627
I don't think you have
it on all the way again.

192
00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:34.920
Look.

193
00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:36.255

I said I got it. okay?

196
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.061
Why are you always
hovering over me?

197
00:12:52.396 --> 00:12:54.440
Because I've been standing
here for an hour watching

198
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.233
you try to do something
that anyone can do

199
00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:57.276
in 20 minutes.

205
00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:29.016
You gotta be kidding me.

206
00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:08.305
We were here earlier.

207
00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.225
I know.

208
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.979
I feel like we’ve been
here for the past year.

209
00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:20.276
That's what tonight was
supposed to fix though.

210
00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:20.985
right?

211
00:14:23.612 --> 00:14:25.197
No. I mean. me and the kids.

212
00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:27.658
We came here earlier.

213
00:14:35.082 --> 00:14:35.958
They wanted to play

214
00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.293

215
00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:41.797
Shit...

216
00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:44.550
Her ballet recital was tonight.

217
00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:48.721
It was.

218
00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:51.098
I don't know how I keep

219
00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:52.182
letting this happen.

220
00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:53.392
Well...

221
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.061
If you’d answered the
phone after the three

222
00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:57.062
times I called you.

223
00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:58.439
I could have reminded you.

224
00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:00.733
Again.

225
00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:06.906

for us.

227
00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:17.750
You should have seen her.

228
00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:21.086
She was so...

229
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.880
beautiful.

230
00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:28.260
I should have.

231
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:30.930
I'm sorry.

232
00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.812
We can't catch a break. can we?

233
00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:47.529
What were you

234
00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:48.489

235
00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:52.409
When?

236
00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:55.204
Right before the tire popped.

237
00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:56.538
you were gonna say something.

238
00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:02.336
Doesn't matter.

239
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.589
We should get going. though.

240
00:16:07.716 --> 00:16:09.134
Yeah. you're right.

241
00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:36.036
I don't suppose you're
still in the mood?

262
00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:08.694

your cops are coming tonight.

00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:50.874
That asshole acted like

383
00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:51.875
he'd never seen me before.

384
00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:52.960
That was so weird.

385
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:53.961
Maybe he heard you

386
00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:55.087
talking about him earlier.

387
00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:56.088
Really?

388
00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:58.257
He got that butthurt over that?

389
00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:03.845
I'm just gonna call again.

390
00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.222
Maybe I'll get someone else.

391
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.265
I doubt it.

392
00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.683
Look what happened earlier.

393
00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:09.017
I'm gonna try.

394
00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:14.398
Hi.

395
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.441
Earlier. there were people
in our house and I think

396
00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:17.067
they're still there.

397
00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:17.776
We just want to--

398
00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.320
[dispatcher speaking...]

399
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.363
2210 East Linc--

400
00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:22.614
[dispatcher speaking...]

401
00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:23.448
Hello?

402
00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:24.199
[phone clicking]

403
00:21:24.574 --> 00:21:25.075
No.

404
00:21:31.164 --> 00:21:31.832
Hello?

405
00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:35.544
I can hear you!

406
00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:36.253
[phone clicking]

407
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.129
Shit!

408
00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:38.338
Okay. look.

409
00:21:38.338 --> 00:21:39.548
let's just try to calm down

410
00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:40.007
and

411
00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:41.049
we can figure something out.

412
00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:41.466
okay?

413
00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:43.969
How can I?!

414
00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:44.720
Just try!

415
00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:47.139
I’m trying.

416
00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:50.517
Seriously. though.

417
00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:51.601
what are we gonna do?

418
00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:56.189
Okay. look.

419
00:21:56.606 --> 00:21:59.109
There's at least one neighbor
that we know we can rely on.

420
00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:04.323
Oh no.

421
00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:07.534
One neighbor you can rely on.

422
00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:09.661
It's like 11 o’clock.

423
00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:11.079
She's not even gonna
want us there anyway.

424
00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:12.039
She said herself.

425
00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:13.623
Come over and hang out
whenever you want.

426
00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:15.292
now that we live in the
same neighborhood.

427
00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:17.252
I'm positive

428
00:22:17.627 --> 00:22:19.546
that invite wasn't for me.

429
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.464
Okay. well.

430
00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:21.048
I think she's gonna

431
00:22:21.048 --> 00:22:23.091
understand. given the
current circumstance.

432
00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:24.801
Albie. come on.

433
00:22:24.801 --> 00:22:25.802
I don't... It’s late.

434
00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:27.763
I don't want to be out
here like this right now.

435
00:22:29.639 --> 00:22:29.890
Fine.

436
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.933
But one stupid comment from
her and I'm out of there.

437
00:22:31.933 --> 00:22:32.267
Fine.

438
00:22:32.434 --> 00:22:32.893
Fine.

439
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.769
Fine.

440
00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:34.895
Just see how it goes.

441
00:23:02.756 --> 00:23:03.131
Okay.

442
00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:04.466
Thanks so much.

443
00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:05.467
Bye.

444
00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:08.845
The witch is still accepting
victims at this hour?

445
00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:09.888
Would you stop it?

446
00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:11.306
She's coming to the
door right now.

447
00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:12.516
Don't screw this up.

448
00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:13.225
What?...

449
00:23:14.142 --> 00:23:15.394
You can’t tell me that
it’s not weird that

450
00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:16.144
she’s up right now.

451
00:23:16.144 --> 00:23:17.604
let alone coming to the door.

452
00:23:17.604 --> 00:23:18.105
Shhh.

453
00:23:18.522 --> 00:23:19.022
Come on.

454
00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:20.774
Okay. maybe just a little.

455
00:23:23.652 --> 00:23:24.152
Penny.

456
00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:26.571
did you finally remember
that we're neighbors?

457
00:23:27.114 --> 00:23:27.948
Come on in.

458
00:23:31.326 --> 00:23:33.870
We've only been here
two weeks. Kimmy.

459
00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:36.832
Two weeks is too long for
not visiting your sister.

460
00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:46.425
Albie.

461
00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.718
it is very nice to see you.

462
00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:56.726
It's nice to see you. too.

463
00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:59.146
We were just saying how
surprised we are that...

464
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:03.275
surprised and thankful we
are that you were up

465
00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:05.193
and so gracious to...

466
00:24:05.485 --> 00:24:06.278
let us in.

467
00:24:06.778 --> 00:24:07.112
Oh.

468
00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:11.575
I suppose I like to stay up
a little later these days.

469
00:24:16.246 --> 00:24:17.831
Well. tell me all about

470
00:24:17.831 --> 00:24:18.415
your problem.

471
00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:19.875
I love a good drama.

472
00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:21.251
I'll get the drinks.

473
00:24:21.668 --> 00:24:22.377
Thanks Kimmy.

474
00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:23.295
You're the best.

475
00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:26.298
Don't mention it.

476
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.888
So. rather than watching
Albie get shot in the head.

477
00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:35.140
I thought it best that we
get out of the situation

478
00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.433
as quickly as possible.

479
00:24:37.184 --> 00:24:38.435
And long story short.

480
00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:39.060
I thought

481
00:24:39.686 --> 00:24:40.979
we could come here.

482
00:24:41.354 --> 00:24:42.105
figure it out.

483
00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:44.065
and maybe. uh...

484
00:24:46.693 --> 00:24:47.986
maybe stay the night.

485
00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:49.988
And. what do you intend

486
00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:50.822
to do after that?

487
00:24:53.533 --> 00:24:57.078
Well. I thought we could go
to the city in the morning

488
00:24:57.078 --> 00:25:00.040
and maybe talk to someone
who isn’t in on whatever

489
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.374
the hell is going on over there.

490
00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:03.793
Go to the city. you say?

491
00:25:04.085 --> 00:25:04.753
Yeah.

492
00:25:06.087 --> 00:25:07.005
So what do you say?

493
00:25:07.589 --> 00:25:08.548
Can we stay?

494
00:25:23.313 --> 00:25:23.897
I think...

495
00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:25.482
no.

496
00:25:27.275 --> 00:25:28.860
Come on. Kimmy.

497
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.403
It's just for one night.

498
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.364
I don't say it out of meanness.

499
00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:34.616
I say it in order to
help you both.

500
00:25:34.824 --> 00:25:35.492
Truly.

501
00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:37.661
Truly.

502
00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:41.998
Well. if you really wanted to
help us. you'd let us stay.

503
00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:43.833
Please.

504
00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:44.584
Think about it.

505
00:25:45.293 --> 00:25:47.587
What could these people possibly
want with your house?

506
00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:50.048
They'd have to know that you’d
come back with evidence

507
00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:51.049
of owning the property.

508
00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:52.634
and that they'd end up in jail.

509
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:54.427
It's obvious.

510
00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:56.846
They don't want your house.

511
00:25:57.305 --> 00:25:57.597
They want

512
00:25:57.597 --> 00:25:58.598
something inside of it.

513
00:25:59.474 --> 00:26:00.600
They take it and then.

514
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.226
bam!

515
00:26:01.768 --> 00:26:03.144
They’re gone to Mexico.

516
00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:08.650
Can you think of anything
they might be after?

517
00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:12.779
Something valuable?

518
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.116
I don't know.

519
00:26:16.366 --> 00:26:18.410
Maybe a few pieces of jewelry.

520
00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:19.953
Are you sure?

521
00:26:19.953 --> 00:26:21.454
Yeah. pretty sure.

522
00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:25.208
Well. either way. I think you
should go back and find out.

523
00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:27.711
There's only one way to
beat a crooked cop.

524
00:26:28.044 --> 00:26:29.087
and that's with evidence.

525
00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:31.172
And how are we supposed

526
00:26:31.172 --> 00:26:32.424
to get evidence?

527
00:26:32.882 --> 00:26:33.341
Easy.

528
00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:35.343
Hideaway somewhere
and video them.

529
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.095
We shouldn’t go back
over there tonight.

530
00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:39.764
It'll just result in another
dangerous confrontation.

531
00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:40.807
If they end up finding you.

532
00:26:40.807 --> 00:26:42.559
just play the desperate card.

533
00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:44.894
Tell them that you'll give them
whatever it is that they want.

534
00:26:44.978 --> 00:26:46.021
Just be sure you're

535
00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:47.272
recording the conversation.

536
00:26:48.064 --> 00:26:49.441
Then all the power's yours.

537
00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:50.609
I. I like it.

538
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:51.901
I don’t know.

539
00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.820
You’ll have to be
very convincing.

540
00:26:55.322 --> 00:26:56.156
Use those amazing

541
00:26:56.156 --> 00:26:57.490
acting skills of yours.

542
00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.200
Afterwards. you'll have
everything you need

543
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.452
to press heavy charges.

544
00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:02.746
I’m in.

545
00:27:03.496 --> 00:27:04.247
Let's go Penny.

546
00:27:04.664 --> 00:27:06.583
Otherwise. who knows what
they're getting away with

547
00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:07.250
over there.

548
00:27:08.835 --> 00:27:09.377
She's right.

549
00:27:09.794 --> 00:27:11.129
It may already be too late

550
00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.548
Pen. come on. Let’s go.

551
00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:18.970
No communication

552
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.764
or even coming into
contact with them

553
00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:22.766
until we have evidence
of them stealing.

554
00:27:23.391 --> 00:27:24.351
All right. let's go.

555
00:27:25.393 --> 00:27:26.561
Let me know how it goes.

556
00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:43.328
You know. I don’t care

557
00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:44.204
what they say about you.

558
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.082
I've always known you
have a great head on

559
00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:47.874
your shoulders.

560
00:27:54.255 --> 00:27:54.881
Remember.

561
00:27:56.007 --> 00:27:56.925
play the desperate card.

562
00:27:58.802 --> 00:27:59.302
Yeah.

563
00:28:28.748 --> 00:28:30.375
What do you suppose
has gotten into her?

564
00:28:35.296 --> 00:28:36.005
I don't know.

565
00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:38.925
Maybe she’s been lonely

566
00:28:38.925 --> 00:28:39.968
since the divorce.

567
00:28:45.014 --> 00:28:45.765
Yeah.

568
00:28:46.474 --> 00:28:47.475
Maybe you're right.

569
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.855
Good call on going to her house.

570
00:28:51.855 --> 00:28:54.232
I think it was a good chance
to clear our heads and

571
00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:56.609
make a strong decision.

572
00:28:58.945 --> 00:28:59.654
Yeah.

573
00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:05.994
So...

574
00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:07.412
what’s the plan?

575
00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:20.008
What's the plan?

576
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.011
Why are you asking me?

577
00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:25.013
You’re so eager. you tell
me what the plan is.

578
00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:28.725
Okay.

579
00:29:29.893 --> 00:29:32.145
So. you said we should make
sure to stay out of sight

580
00:29:32.145 --> 00:29:33.980
until we get evidence of
them stealing. right?

581
00:29:34.147 --> 00:29:34.647
Yes.

582
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:36.316
So. then.

583
00:29:36.941 --> 00:29:38.318
we'll need to sneak up on them.

584
00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:40.528
Genius.

585
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.863
We're saved.

586
00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:43.656
You're not helping.

587
00:29:43.656 --> 00:29:45.033
Okay. please continue.

588
00:29:46.034 --> 00:29:47.535
So. the solution is simple.

589
00:29:48.369 --> 00:29:49.454
We go through the backyard

590
00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:51.206
and then straight
in the back door.

591
00:29:51.664 --> 00:29:52.957
It'll for sure work.

592
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.002
We’ll totally be able to sneak
up on those assholes.

593
00:29:57.587 --> 00:29:58.588
It's perfect. right?

594
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.174
I don't like it.

595
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:03.885
You want us to go inside
the house. while those

596
00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:04.844
weirdos are in there?

597
00:30:05.595 --> 00:30:08.056
Can’t we just wait outside.
catch them while they're

598
00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:10.016
walking out with whatever
it is they're gonna take?

599
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.102
No. we can't wait outside.

600
00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:14.771
We need to get close.

601
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:15.396
Take action.

602
00:30:15.396 --> 00:30:17.649
It's our house. our stuff.

603
00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:19.526
It's impossible to try to
get through to you.

604
00:30:20.109 --> 00:30:22.487
None of that matters
if you're shot dead.

605
00:30:23.404 --> 00:30:24.781
He's a cop.

606
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:26.407
You really think he'll shoot us?

607
00:30:26.783 --> 00:30:27.659
I don't think so.

608
00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:30.745
You know what happens
to cops in prison?

609
00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:33.998
Excuse me for not
being convinced

610
00:30:33.998 --> 00:30:36.251
that a criminal cop
won't shoot us.

611
00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:39.587
You really don't wanna go back?

612
00:30:40.713 --> 00:30:42.006
Not right now. I don’t.

613
00:30:43.132 --> 00:30:45.718
Do you realize what's most
likely happening to our

614
00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:47.428
home and everything
in it right now?

615
00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:49.347
I do. but the f...

616
00:30:49.764 --> 00:30:50.765
The fight isn't worth

617
00:30:50.765 --> 00:30:51.808
what might happen.

618
00:30:55.436 --> 00:30:56.521
You don't even care.

619
00:30:57.647 --> 00:30:59.315
It wasn't you who bought

620
00:30:59.315 --> 00:31:00.733
the house and everything in it.

621
00:31:06.155 --> 00:31:06.906
You know what?

622
00:31:09.242 --> 00:31:11.035
When we get there. just
do whatever you want.

623
00:31:11.452 --> 00:31:12.495
I won't be a part of it.

624
00:31:13.454 --> 00:31:14.289
You can go to jail

625
00:31:14.289 --> 00:31:15.164
for all I care.

626
00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:21.838
Okay.

627
00:31:22.171 --> 00:31:22.964
Sorry.

628
00:31:24.424 --> 00:31:25.300
This isn't helping at all.

629
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:25.717
right now.

630
00:31:25.925 --> 00:31:26.801
No. it's not.

631
00:31:27.927 --> 00:31:28.803
How’s this?

632
00:31:30.847 --> 00:31:31.723
We try my plan

633
00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:32.932
and if...

634
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.894
and if for some reason
it doesn't work.

635
00:31:35.935 --> 00:31:38.271
we can play the desperate
card like Kim suggested.

636
00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:40.315
It'll be perfect.

637
00:31:40.648 --> 00:31:41.232
What do you say?

638
00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:41.816
Fine.

639
00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:45.361
But if at any moment I feel
like we need to leave.

640
00:31:45.486 --> 00:31:46.571
we are leaving.

641
00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:48.197
No questions asked.

642
00:31:49.365 --> 00:31:50.617
It's gonna work.

643
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:53.328
Let’s just get it over with.

644
00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:14.182
You ready?

645
00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:15.642
I guess so.

646
00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:16.893
Hey.

647
00:32:18.227 --> 00:32:19.312
Don’t worry so much.

648
00:32:19.687 --> 00:32:20.438
We’ll be fine.

649
00:32:20.855 --> 00:32:22.106
If we’re gonna do this. let’s go

650
00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:25.026
Okay.

651
00:32:27.487 --> 00:32:27.987
Looks clear.

652
00:32:27.987 --> 00:32:28.738
Let's go.

653
00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:24.377
This way.

654
00:33:28.965 --> 00:33:29.674
Shhh.

655
00:33:37.724 --> 00:33:38.975
What are we doing back here?

656
00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:40.435
We’ll go over the wall.

657
00:33:40.435 --> 00:33:41.894
They’ll never see us
coming this way.

658
00:33:41.936 --> 00:33:42.729
Whatever.

659
00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:44.689
Okay.

660
00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:46.149
Who goes first?

661
00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:47.692
This is your idea.

662
00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:49.068
You’re going first.

663
00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:51.195
Okay. but...

664
00:33:51.612 --> 00:33:52.530
how can I help you over

665
00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:53.656
if I go over first?

666
00:33:54.323 --> 00:33:55.324
I can get over myself.

667
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:56.117
thanks.

668
00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:57.827
Okay. it’s settled.

669
00:33:57.952 --> 00:33:58.703
I'll go over first.

670
00:33:58.703 --> 00:33:59.454
Stop stalling.

671
00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:00.455
I’m not stalling.

672
00:34:00.455 --> 00:34:00.830
Go.

673
00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:16.304
What are you doing?

674
00:34:16.304 --> 00:34:17.346
Helping you down.

675
00:34:18.014 --> 00:34:19.474
Okay. I’m just gonna
help you down.

676
00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:21.517
[chickens clucking]

677
00:34:21.517 --> 00:34:21.934
Shhh.

678
00:34:21.934 --> 00:34:22.560
Shhh.

679
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.644
[chickens clucking]

680
00:34:23.644 --> 00:34:25.396
You just had to have
these stupid chickens.

681
00:34:25.438 --> 00:34:25.897
What?

682
00:34:25.938 --> 00:34:26.355
Shhh.

683
00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:28.024
Don’t blame the chickens.

684
00:34:28.024 --> 00:34:28.775
[chickens clucking]

685
00:34:28.775 --> 00:34:30.068
Those stupid things.

686
00:34:30.193 --> 00:34:31.235
Just gave us away.

687
00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:32.111
Let’s just keep going.

688
00:34:32.111 --> 00:34:32.612
Come on.

689
00:34:32.612 --> 00:34:33.321
Shhh.

690
00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:33.821
Go.

691
00:34:33.988 --> 00:34:34.489
Go.

692
00:34:34.655 --> 00:34:35.198
Come on.

693
00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:42.413
[gate opening]

694
00:34:53.716 --> 00:34:54.926
You get your fire pit

695
00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.302
and I get my chicken coop.

696
00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:58.846
Don't be mad at me
cause your project’s

697
00:34:58.846 --> 00:35:00.765
still just a pile of old bricks.

698
00:35:02.016 --> 00:35:03.351
You try digging out a fire pit

699
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:05.019
on top of working
ten hour days.

700
00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:09.482
You try building a chicken coop
with two small children

701
00:35:09.482 --> 00:35:10.775
hanging on you all day.

702
00:35:15.363 --> 00:35:16.155
The coast is clear.

703
00:35:16.155 --> 00:35:16.864
Let's move.

704
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:28.543
Wait here.

705
00:35:28.709 --> 00:35:29.210
What?

706
00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:30.211
Wait here.

707
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.254
Albie?

708
00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:32.797
Hey.

709
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:34.966
Hey!

710
00:35:47.061 --> 00:35:48.437
[shovel hitting floor]

711
00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:50.690
Shit.

712
00:35:52.775 --> 00:35:54.235
Albie. what are you doing?

713
00:35:59.907 --> 00:36:00.575
Albie?!

714
00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:04.245
Shit.

715
00:36:19.927 --> 00:36:20.678
What are you doing?

716
00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:22.930
Why do you have that?

717
00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:24.932
Just in case.

718
00:36:38.946 --> 00:36:39.822
She was right.

719
00:36:40.448 --> 00:36:41.908
Time to catch them
in the middle of it.

720
00:36:42.742 --> 00:36:43.451
Let’s go.

721
00:36:43.618 --> 00:36:44.619
Okay. yeah.

722
00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:45.828
But you're not

723
00:36:45.828 --> 00:36:46.787
taking that in there.

724
00:36:47.413 --> 00:36:47.914
But it’s for--

725
00:36:47.914 --> 00:36:48.456
Albie.

726
00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:49.248
leave it.

727
00:36:50.124 --> 00:36:50.499
It’s a--

728
00:36:50.499 --> 00:36:51.125
Leave it!

729
00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:53.085
Fine.

730
00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:55.588
Start recording.

731
00:36:56.756 --> 00:36:57.256
Okay.

732
00:37:21.113 --> 00:37:21.697
Shhh.

733
00:37:22.323 --> 00:37:23.241
It was the woman.

734
00:37:23.366 --> 00:37:24.242
She didn’t see me.

735
00:37:25.451 --> 00:37:26.244
I think they’re in the bedroom.

736
00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:27.453
They’re probably going
for the jewelry.

737
00:37:27.453 --> 00:37:28.537
I’m still recording.

738
00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:30.665
Now is as good a
time as any. right?

739

[Loud noises...]

740
00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:36.671
What’s that?

741
00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:37.421
I don’t know.

742
00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:38.756
[Loud noises...]

743
00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:40.383
Maybe they’re breaking
into your safe.

744
00:37:48.516 --> 00:37:49.350
Shit.

745
00:37:52.728 --> 00:37:53.271
Move!

746
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:56.857
Hey. partner.

747
00:37:58.484 --> 00:37:59.068
You look like

748
00:37:59.068 --> 00:38:00.319
you could use a drink.

749
00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:56.042
Help!

750
00:39:02.757 --> 00:39:03.507
Don't struggle.

751
00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:05.176
You won't break free.

752
00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:08.137
Any attempt to do
so will be futile.

753
00:39:08.929 --> 00:39:09.972
Albie!

754
00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:12.058

Help...

No one can hear you down here.

758
00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:20.649
And it's highly unlikely
anyone in close proximity

759
00:39:20.649 --> 00:39:22.485
will be willing to assist you.

760
00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:24.779
Please. let me go.

761
00:39:24.779 --> 00:39:26.530
We’ll give you
whatever you want.

762
00:39:27.239 --> 00:39:28.574
You can have your freedom

763
00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:31.327
as soon as we find
what we're looking for.

764
00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:34.663
Now. does the male
have the only access

765
00:39:34.663 --> 00:39:36.082
to the collective intelligence?

766
00:39:38.417 --> 00:39:41.337
Just ask for whatever it is you
want and just leave us alone.

767
00:39:42.588 --> 00:39:43.631
Answer the question

768
00:39:43.631 --> 00:39:44.882
and you'll be set free.

769
00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:46.217
The question?

770
00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:49.178
I don't know what
the question is.

771
00:39:50.346 --> 00:39:51.847
The collective intelligence.

772
00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:55.851
I don’t know what
you’re talking about.

773
00:39:57.019 --> 00:39:57.895
Come now.

774
00:39:58.437 --> 00:39:59.939
You're not the first laborers

775
00:39:59.939 --> 00:40:01.190
we've intercepted.

776
00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:07.947
What is the primary method
for communicating directives

777
00:40:07.947 --> 00:40:10.116
within the Central
Intelligence Network?

778
00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:13.077
Spies?

779
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:15.788
You have the wrong people.

780
00:40:15.788 --> 00:40:17.123
We’re not spies.

781
00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:19.834
Do not attempt to deceive us.

782
00:40:20.167 --> 00:40:22.044
We will not be easily misled.

783
00:40:22.503 --> 00:40:25.381
I swear you have
the wrong people.

784
00:40:25.381 --> 00:40:26.340
Please.

785
00:40:29.468 --> 00:40:32.263
If you do not want to
cooperate. you will

786
00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:34.723
suffer until you are
willing to do so.

787
00:40:55.828 --> 00:40:56.454
Oh my God.

788
00:40:57.455 --> 00:40:58.247
Oh my God.

789
00:41:00.374 --> 00:41:01.417
Please stop.

790
00:41:01.542 --> 00:41:02.626
When the pain subsides.

791
00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:03.794
we can start again.

792
00:41:05.921 --> 00:41:07.840
Please. stop.

793
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:11.427
The suffering will end.

794
00:41:11.427 --> 00:41:13.137
if you tell me what
I want to know

795
00:41:14.597 --> 00:41:16.056
I wanna help you.

796
00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:18.058
Please.

797
00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:20.853
There. now that's progress.

798
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:23.189
Is the access point
here in this room?

799
00:41:24.899 --> 00:41:25.274
How is the

800
00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:26.484
connection established?

801
00:41:27.735 --> 00:41:28.944
I don’t know.

802
00:41:53.135 --> 00:41:54.970
Please stop.

803
00:41:56.764 --> 00:41:58.641
I don’t know what you want.

804
00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:02.019
I can’t help you.

805
00:42:02.561 --> 00:42:03.521
Please.

806
00:42:04.813 --> 00:42:05.856
We'll see.

807
00:42:38.681 --> 00:42:39.431
Hey.

808
00:42:39.848 --> 00:42:41.976
You're looking pretty
messy there. partner.

809
00:42:42.768 --> 00:42:43.602
Let me help you.

810
00:42:43.978 --> 00:42:45.437
Oh. oh. oh. oh.

811
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:48.274
You’re gonna need to calm down.

812
00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:50.568
before we can get
anywhere productive.

813
00:42:51.193 --> 00:42:51.944
And a...

814
00:42:51.944 --> 00:42:55.114
I'm sorry about the
blunt force earlier.

815
00:42:55.114 --> 00:42:55.698
It's just you

816
00:42:55.698 --> 00:42:58.867
so love to stand in the way
of what's best for you.

817
00:42:59.159 --> 00:43:01.161
And we wanted to
put all that behind

818
00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:02.871
us as fast as we could.

819
00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:07.835
You really need
to calm yourself.

820
00:43:08.043 --> 00:43:10.045
if we're going to proceed
with this inquiry.

821
00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.172
Okay. then

822
00:43:25.978 --> 00:43:27.104
There...

823
00:43:27.896 --> 00:43:29.398
You’re starting to calm now.

824
00:43:30.899 --> 00:43:31.942
Let's begin.

825
00:43:41.869 --> 00:43:43.579
Now we can begin.

826
00:43:48.334 --> 00:43:48.667
You.

827
00:43:48.667 --> 00:43:50.044
you son-of-a-bitch.

828
00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:51.837
I'll kill you.

829
00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:54.590
Kill?

830
00:43:56.008 --> 00:43:56.550
Me?

831
00:44:02.097 --> 00:44:03.515
If you're saying

832
00:44:03.724 --> 00:44:05.100
what I think you're saying.

833
00:44:06.226 --> 00:44:07.686
That's an interesting notion.

834
00:44:08.771 --> 00:44:09.521
considering

835
00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:10.856
the position you're in.

836
00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:14.860
You’re not gonna
get away with this.

837
00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:16.695
I bet someone's looking
for you right now.

838
00:44:17.863 --> 00:44:18.781
When they catch you.

839
00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:20.949
I'm gonna be there
to watch you burn.

840
00:44:22.368 --> 00:44:24.703
I don't believe you're going
to be around long enough

841
00:44:24.703 --> 00:44:26.497
to watch much of anything.

842
00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:29.375
And nobody's coming for us.

843
00:44:31.377 --> 00:44:33.337
We don't even exist.

844
00:44:36.757 --> 00:44:37.925
Now. let's begin.

845
00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:38.550
huh?

846
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:40.803
Screw you!

847
00:44:42.554 --> 00:44:44.807
Another interesting notion

848
00:44:45.474 --> 00:44:46.725
and a surprising proposal

849
00:44:46.725 --> 00:44:47.351
coming from you.

850
00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:47.935
Uh...

851
00:44:48.435 --> 00:44:50.396
No. I don't think I will.

852
00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:53.649
You should just kill me now.

853
00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:56.110
Once I get out of this.

854
00:44:57.444 --> 00:44:58.028
I'm seriously

855
00:44:58.028 --> 00:44:59.780
gonna rip you apart.

856
00:45:01.031 --> 00:45:03.659
Why would I want to kill you?

857
00:45:05.953 --> 00:45:06.870
I haven't gotten any

858
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.372
information from you yet.

859
00:45:08.872 --> 00:45:09.957
Information?

860
00:45:10.749 --> 00:45:12.084
You’re not getting shit from me!

861
00:45:12.084 --> 00:45:12.376
Oh.

862
00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:14.211
I believe I will

863
00:45:14.294 --> 00:45:14.837
with a...

864
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.422
a little persuasion.

865
00:45:17.172 --> 00:45:17.715
Now.

866
00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:20.259
I want you to tell me

867
00:45:20.592 --> 00:45:23.095
how you access the
collective intelligence.

868
00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:30.769
This could all be so quick

869
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:33.188
and simple. and then I could let

870
00:45:33.188 --> 00:45:34.314
you free.

871
00:45:35.858 --> 00:45:37.484
Let's make a deal. you and I.

872
00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:40.195
You tell me what I want to know.

873
00:45:40.529 --> 00:45:42.990
and in return. I will grant you

874
00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.367
whatever your heart desires.

875
00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:46.910
I don't want

876
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.871
anything from you. asshole!

877
00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:50.873
But...

878
00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:52.499
you're a failure.

879
00:45:53.709 --> 00:45:55.753
Everything in your life

880
00:45:55.753 --> 00:45:57.838
is a failure.

881
00:45:59.548 --> 00:46:00.340
I could free you

882
00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.467
from that failure.

883
00:46:03.135 --> 00:46:04.303
You don't know me.

884
00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:09.558
Your union with your wife

885
00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:11.310
is in its last days.

886
00:46:13.645 --> 00:46:15.230
Maybe I should offer her a deal.

887
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.191
I'm certain

888
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:19.193
I could please her in ways

889
00:46:19.193 --> 00:46:20.569
that you never could.

890
00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:22.863
And then we wouldn't
need you anymore.

891
00:46:22.863 --> 00:46:24.156
You’d be discarded.

892
00:46:24.156 --> 00:46:27.201
and she could live her life
with all the pleasures

893
00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:28.243
of her heart.

894
00:46:28.494 --> 00:46:29.703
I swear to God.

895
00:46:29.703 --> 00:46:32.790
If you touch her at all.
I will fucking kill you!

896
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:35.959
Again.

897
00:46:36.335 --> 00:46:38.295
I've failed to communicate

898
00:46:38.295 --> 00:46:40.881
that you are in no position to
make demands or threats.

899
00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:41.215
I...

900
00:46:42.216 --> 00:46:44.802
I need to work on my
communication skills.

901
00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:17.876
You resort to aggression

902
00:47:17.876 --> 00:47:18.836
so quickly.

903
00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:19.294
but

904
00:47:19.837 --> 00:47:22.089
aggression never seems
to go very far with you.

905
00:48:06.133 --> 00:48:06.967
[glass breaking]

906
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:43.295
Hello there. friend.

907
00:48:48.508 --> 00:48:50.385
I think you and I are
going to have a

908
00:48:50.385 --> 00:48:53.180
much more productive time
than I had with your man.

909
00:48:59.061 --> 00:49:00.062
Yes.

910
00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:03.190
very productive indeed.

911
00:49:03.482 --> 00:49:04.358
Please don't.

912
00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:09.613
Albie!

913
00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:10.030
Shhh.

914
00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:10.572
Shhh.

915
00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:11.907
Shhhhhh.

916
00:49:12.157 --> 00:49:12.991
Calm down.

917
00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:15.827
Calm down.

918
00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:20.332
You want this to be as
pleasurable as it can be.

919
00:49:20.332 --> 00:49:20.874
don’t you?

920
00:49:22.084 --> 00:49:23.377
You don't want to go
back to the methods

921
00:49:23.377 --> 00:49:24.878
my colleague was using. do you?

922
00:49:30.717 --> 00:49:31.343
There.

923
00:49:38.934 --> 00:49:40.811
We’re not who you think we are.

924
00:49:47.025 --> 00:49:48.026
We just moved in.

925
00:49:49.403 --> 00:49:51.071
You're probably mixing
us up with whoever

926
00:49:51.071 --> 00:49:52.781
it was who lived here before us.

927
00:49:54.074 --> 00:49:54.491
No.

928
00:49:55.242 --> 00:49:56.910
that’s definitely not the case.

929
00:49:58.412 --> 00:49:59.830
Well. how could you be sure?

930
00:50:02.708 --> 00:50:03.291
I know

931
00:50:03.959 --> 00:50:05.711
Because we're the ones who
were here before you.

932
00:50:06.795 --> 00:50:07.462
We've been here

933
00:50:07.462 --> 00:50:08.880
a very long time.

934
00:50:11.633 --> 00:50:13.176
Please. just let me go.

935
00:50:14.344 --> 00:50:16.972
We can’t help you with
whatever it is you want.

936
00:50:19.266 --> 00:50:20.976
I promise we’ll just leave.

937
00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:22.978
No.

938
00:50:23.895 --> 00:50:25.814
We can’t be doing that. can we?

939
00:50:30.777 --> 00:50:32.279
Tell me what you want
me to do to you.

940
00:50:47.294 --> 00:50:48.003
What just?

941
00:50:53.508 --> 00:50:54.217
Nothing?

942
00:50:55.761 --> 00:50:56.428
Huh

943
00:50:58.138 --> 00:50:58.889
Pity.

944
00:51:21.787 --> 00:51:23.330
You gonna try to kill me. too?

945
00:51:24.247 --> 00:51:25.123
That depends.

946
00:51:25.207 --> 00:51:26.708
Are you going to be cooperative?

947
00:51:27.667 --> 00:51:29.711
You should have just
let him finish the job.

948
00:51:30.045 --> 00:51:31.671
I'm aware you can
be very stubborn.

949
00:51:32.047 --> 00:51:33.799
I can be very persuasive.

950
00:51:39.805 --> 00:51:40.764
Good for you.

951
00:51:41.223 --> 00:51:42.557
Are you going to be cooperative?

952
00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:44.476
Depends.

953
00:51:45.102 --> 00:51:46.311
Are you and your
weird little friend

954
00:51:46.311 --> 00:51:48.605
going to crawl into a hole
somewhere and die?

955
00:52:07.582 --> 00:52:08.750
To answer your question.

956
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:09.793
I don't think we will.

957
00:52:24.599 --> 00:52:26.184
Tell me. how do we access

958
00:52:26.184 --> 00:52:27.519
the collective intelligence?

959
00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:36.945
We can do whatever you want.

960
00:52:36.945 --> 00:52:38.697
as long as you tell me
what I need to know.

961
00:52:39.406 --> 00:52:40.991
I don't know what you want.

962
00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:42.576
Maybe we can loosen up a bit

963
00:52:43.869 --> 00:52:44.619
and then something

964
00:52:44.619 --> 00:52:45.537
will come to you.

965
00:52:49.708 --> 00:52:50.500
What are you doing?

966
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.585
Get off of me.

967
00:52:52.627 --> 00:52:53.670
Get off of me!

968
00:52:55.088 --> 00:52:56.047
Confirm for me.

969
00:52:56.464 --> 00:52:58.466
Is the access point
here in this house?

970
00:52:59.092 --> 00:52:59.968
Confirm.

971
00:53:00.135 --> 00:53:02.470
The collective has not yet
achieved telepathic ability.

972
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:03.054
correct?

973
00:53:04.055 --> 00:53:05.348
My wife. where's my wife?

974
00:53:05.599 --> 00:53:06.474
Where's Penny?

975
00:53:06.474 --> 00:53:08.560
There's no need to concern
yourself with her right now.

976
00:53:08.977 --> 00:53:11.188
Besides. what she doesn't
know won't hurt her.

977
00:53:11.813 --> 00:53:12.898
That is how the saying goes.

978
00:53:12.898 --> 00:53:13.523
correct?

979
00:53:16.776 --> 00:53:18.153
I can make you squeal.

980
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.572
so you might as well just tell
me what I need to know.

981
00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:23.491
Will you just stop!

982
00:53:24.075 --> 00:53:24.868
Just stop!

983
00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:25.952
I haven't had children.

984
00:53:26.453 --> 00:53:27.871
I know that's what you prefer.

985
00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:30.040
No.

986
00:53:31.458 --> 00:53:32.667
No. that’s not true.

987
00:53:33.293 --> 00:53:34.544
Then what is true?

988
00:54:21.216 --> 00:54:28.848
[noises upstairs...]

989
00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:34.312
[noises outside the room]

990
00:54:35.522 --> 00:54:46.074
[loud noises...]

991
00:55:08.179 --> 00:55:12.100
[loud noises...]

992
00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:21.484
[noises upstairs...]

[glass breaking]

994
00:55:42.213 --> 00:55:43.173
[knocking on the door]

995
00:55:43.798 --> 00:55:44.966
Hello down there.

996
00:55:47.135 --> 00:55:49.012
I was hoping we could
have a talk. you and I.

997
00:55:50.096 --> 00:55:52.182
Now. between you and me.

998
00:55:52.807 --> 00:55:55.935
we both know that things
aren’t going that well for

999
00:55:55.935 --> 00:55:56.811
Mr. Albie.

1000
00:55:57.979 --> 00:55:58.772
What do you mean?

1001
00:55:59.230 --> 00:55:59.856
Well.

1002
00:56:01.316 --> 00:56:03.276
he's been a little stressed out

1003
00:56:03.276 --> 00:56:06.488
about his status in his current
occupation. you know.

1004
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.616
and if that status
were to continue

1005
00:56:09.616 --> 00:56:12.160
to drop in his position
the way it has been.

1006
00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:13.244
Well.

1007
00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:16.706
you all could lose your
standard of living.

1008
00:56:18.249 --> 00:56:19.959
No more nice things.

1009
00:56:20.794 --> 00:56:23.046
Jewelry. nice dresses.

1010
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:24.923
no more.

1011
00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:26.633
But.

1012
00:56:27.675 --> 00:56:29.219
we can help.

1013
00:56:30.178 --> 00:56:33.556
We can see to it that
you don't need

1014
00:56:33.556 --> 00:56:35.892
Albie's employment
to maintain your lifestyle.

1015
00:56:35.975 --> 00:56:39.270
We can see to it
that you can stand

1016
00:56:39.312 --> 00:56:40.730
on your own.

1017
00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:43.900
You can go back to that
entertainment work

1018
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.652
you're so good at.

1019
00:56:46.277 --> 00:56:48.154
and we can see to it

1020
00:56:48.154 --> 00:56:50.865
that you are offered
all the most desirable

1021
00:56:50.865 --> 00:56:53.410
opportunities your
industry has to offer.

1022
00:56:54.702 --> 00:56:56.121
The nice things stay

1023
00:56:56.663 --> 00:56:57.664
and more to come.

1024
00:56:59.207 --> 00:57:02.252
And all you have
to do is help us.

1025
00:57:05.046 --> 00:57:05.672
Tell me.

1026
00:57:06.214 --> 00:57:08.258
where is your access point

1027
00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:09.801
to the collective intelligence?

1028
00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:14.097
Well?

1029
00:57:25.775 --> 00:57:28.486
[door opening...]

1030
00:57:30.738 --> 00:57:31.531
Hi. Albie.

1031
00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:34.242
After some deliberation.

1032
00:57:34.242 --> 00:57:36.286
we've decided we
want to help you.

1033
00:57:37.328 --> 00:57:38.246
Help me?

1034
00:57:38.663 --> 00:57:39.330
Yes.

1035
00:57:39.706 --> 00:57:41.708
We know that your recent
entertainment endeavors

1036
00:57:41.708 --> 00:57:43.209
have been less than successful.

1037
00:57:44.085 --> 00:57:46.087
We also know that
it is not your skills

1038
00:57:46.087 --> 00:57:48.089
or expertise that are
holding you back.

1039
00:57:48.506 --> 00:57:48.882
No.

1040
00:57:48.882 --> 00:57:51.217
it is those in power
in your industry.

1041
00:57:51.593 --> 00:57:53.178
That’s where me and my
colleagues come in.

1042
00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:55.722
We are very well
connected. you see.

1043
00:57:56.222 --> 00:57:57.515
and we can make things happen.

1044
00:57:59.225 --> 00:58:01.060
We control a great many things.

1045
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:02.520
Mr. Albie Jones.

1046
00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:06.149
Where is your access point for
the collective intelligence?

1047
00:58:11.237 --> 00:58:11.696
Oh.

1048
00:58:12.906 --> 00:58:14.073
Oh. you're bleeding.

1049
00:58:16.451 --> 00:58:17.327
Oh. no. no. no.

1050
00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:17.744
It’s just...

1051
00:58:17.744 --> 00:58:19.287
It's from my head earlier.

1052
00:58:19.287 --> 00:58:20.163
-I’m fine.
-No. it seems

1053
00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:20.663
to be coming

1054
00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:21.831
-from your arm
-No. no I’m

1055
00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:22.207
fine.

1056
00:58:22.207 --> 00:58:22.957
I'm fine.

1057
00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:25.335
Turn and let me see
so I can render aid.

1058
00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:25.960
Seriously.

1059
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:26.669
I'm fine.

1060
00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:29.297
Oh no. you seem to have cut
yourself on this broken glass.

1061
00:58:35.136 --> 00:58:35.887
Think about it.

1062
00:58:36.387 --> 00:58:38.431
Your name will be known
around the world.

1063
00:58:39.974 --> 00:58:40.767
You can have

1064
00:58:41.476 --> 00:58:43.394
fame. fortune.

1065
00:58:43.937 --> 00:58:45.605
anything you've ever dreamed of.

1066
00:58:46.356 --> 00:58:47.524
You could have anything

1067
00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:49.692
or anyone you could ever want.

1068
00:58:50.527 --> 00:58:51.402
You could have a woman who

1069
00:58:51.402 --> 00:58:53.029
appreciates you and

1070
00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:54.405
everything you are.

1071
00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:57.575
So all I have to do
is tell you where

1072
00:58:57.575 --> 00:58:59.244
the intelligence access is?

1073
00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:00.995
And then you'll

1074
00:59:00.995 --> 00:59:02.038
make me successful.

1075
00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:04.457
and you and I will um...

1076
00:59:05.124 --> 00:59:06.834
you know. have some fun?

1077
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.628
If that's what you would like?

1078
00:59:10.588 --> 00:59:11.047
Deal.

1079
00:59:11.673 --> 00:59:13.132
I knew you'd be reasonable.

1080
00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:14.968
Yeah.

1081
00:59:15.134 --> 00:59:17.387
You know. normally

1082
00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.888
when I do this type of thing.

1083
00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:21.391
I like to start untied.

1084
00:59:22.183 --> 00:59:22.642
No.

1085
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:23.851
You will tell me
how to access

1086
00:59:23.851 --> 00:59:26.020
the collective intelligence.
and then we'll continue

1087
00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:27.021
with the rest of our deal.

1088
00:59:28.147 --> 00:59:28.773
Fine.

1089
00:59:29.941 --> 00:59:31.651
I'll tell you where to
find the access point.

1090
00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:34.779
You have to go and
and get the device.

1091
00:59:35.655 --> 00:59:36.406
and...

1092
00:59:37.323 --> 00:59:39.117
I can tell you how
to operate it.

1093
00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.201
Where's the device?

1094
00:59:41.536 --> 00:59:42.328
Um...

1095
00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:45.999
Outside by the driveway
next to the house.

1096
00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:49.627
You’ll see a large
metal enclosure.

1097
00:59:51.045 --> 00:59:52.547
Remove the outside
of the enclosure

1098
00:59:52.547 --> 00:59:54.132
and look in there.

1099
00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:56.759
You’ll find what
you're looking for.

1100
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:58.803
In your air control unit?

1101
00:59:59.095 --> 00:59:59.596
Yes.

1102
01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:02.098
We've never seen you
access this unit in our

1103
01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:03.808
rigorous observation
of your family.

1104
01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:05.643
I assure you.

1105
01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:06.936
it's there.

1106
01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.117
I wasn’t gonna do anything.

1107
01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:04.535
I swear.

1108
01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:07.372
It was just an accident. okay.

1109
01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:09.290
I’m sorry.

1110
01:01:12.418 --> 01:01:13.086
Please.

1111
01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:14.379
I'm sorry.

1112
01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:17.090
Oh. no apologies are necessary.

1113
01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.634
It was entirely my oversight.

1114
01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:21.886
I'll just need to make certain

1115
01:01:21.886 --> 01:01:23.638
it can never happen again.

1116
01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:27.141
[glass breaking]

1117
01:01:28.434 --> 01:01:30.812
Looks like you could
use a drink. partner.

1118
01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:34.232
Albie.

1119
01:01:35.316 --> 01:01:36.275
Are you okay?

1120
01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:37.819
You okay?

1121
01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:39.153
Yeah. are you?

1122
01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:40.196
Did he hurt you?

1123
01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:42.198
He didn't. but he...

1124
01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:43.658
But he what?

1125
01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:44.992
It doesn’t matter.

1126
01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.786
I’m just glad you're okay.

1127
01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:47.912
Where's the woman?

1128
01:01:48.579 --> 01:01:50.790
She's probably outside at
the AC unit looking for

1129
01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.500
whatever the hell it is
they're looking for.

1130
01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:53.251
What?

1131
01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:54.585
Nevermind.

1132
01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:55.420
We have to get out of here

1133
01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.003
right now.

1134
01:01:57.588 --> 01:01:58.798
Not before this asshole

1135
01:01:58.798 --> 01:01:59.841
gets what's coming to him.

1136
01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:00.967
What?

1137
01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:02.593
You heard me.

1138
01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:03.803
He tried to kill me.

1139
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:07.223
Albie. stop!

1140
01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.561
Albie. wait.

1141
01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:14.814
Albie!

1142
01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:15.982
What?

1143
01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:17.942
Don’t do this.

1144
01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:23.781
For once in your life.

1145
01:02:23.781 --> 01:02:24.824
listen!

1146
01:02:25.658 --> 01:02:26.701
Stop!

1147
01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.038
No. you stop!

1148
01:02:31.622 --> 01:02:33.916
You just stand back
and do nothing.

1149
01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:35.334
like usual.

1150
01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:36.753
What?

1151
01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:38.713
Can't you see.

1152
01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:40.590
we should have just
stayed at Kimmy's?

1153
01:02:40.965 --> 01:02:43.718
None of this would have happened
if you had just listened.

1154
01:02:44.343 --> 01:02:45.762
They would have taken
whatever it was that

1155
01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:46.846
they wanted and left.

1156
01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:48.556
But you don't ever
listen. do you?

1157
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:50.683
Let's go.

1158
01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:52.602
Someone's got to put an end

1159
01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:53.728
to this situation.

1160
01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.400
You're always holding me back.

1161
01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.487
Not anymore.

1162
01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:05.698
You know what?

1163
01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:07.867
Do whatever you want.

1164
01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:09.243
I won't be a part of it.

1165
01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.120
First thing you said in years

1166
01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.246
that's made me happy.

1167
01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:21.714
You should get a lawyer.

1168
01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:23.883
Yeah. hardly.

1169
01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:25.301
They're the ones who attacked us

1170
01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:26.427
in our own home.

1171
01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:28.846
No. I don't mean for them.

1172
01:03:28.846 --> 01:03:29.472
Albie.

1173
01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:32.475
We’ve put this off for too long.

1174
01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:37.855
Fine.

1175
01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:40.066
You think that upsets
me or something?

1176
01:03:40.566 --> 01:03:42.193
I have bigger concerns

1177
01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:42.819
right now.

1178
01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:48.407
You are a pathetic human being.

1179
01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.536
I wasted my life on you.

1180
01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:53.120
Wasted your life?

1181
01:03:53.746 --> 01:03:55.081
You have no life!

1182
01:03:55.414 --> 01:03:57.708
You're just dead weight
leeching off of mine!

1183
01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.809
I'm going in the bedroom
and locking the door.

1184
01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:16.143
Don't try to come in.

1185
01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:20.898
I don't give a shit

1186
01:04:20.898 --> 01:04:21.899
what you do!

1187
01:06:36.283 --> 01:06:37.493
Self-defense.

1188
01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:43.457
Don't worry.

1189
01:06:45.626 --> 01:06:46.919
They don't even exist.

1190
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:53.009
There’s a nice spot next to him.

1191
01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.176
if that crazy bitch ever

1192
01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.011
comes back.

1193
01:07:41.515 --> 01:07:42.224
Kimmy?

1194
01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:51.776
Albie?!

1195
01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:02.369
Albie?!

1196
01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:09.085
Don't waste your breath.

1197
01:08:09.835 --> 01:08:11.253
Albie. come here right now.

1198
01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:12.755
I said don't waste your breath--

1199
01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:13.631
She’s back.

1200
01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:21.472
They’re all back.

1201
01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:28.938
What?

1202
01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:50.709
Came back to end up
like your friend?

1203
01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:54.755
Kimmy. this is the one we
were talking about earlier.

1204
01:08:54.755 --> 01:08:55.548
Mark. you were here.

1205
01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:56.298
Sit down.

1206
01:08:58.676 --> 01:08:59.260
What?!

1207
01:09:01.512 --> 01:09:02.096
Wait a minute.

1208
01:09:02.096 --> 01:09:02.721
We're not doing anything--

1209
01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:05.015
If you don't sit down
now. my associate here

1210
01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:07.393
will use her interrogation
methods on you again.

1211
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:09.395
Perhaps she can ramp up

1212
01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:10.813
the intensity this time.

1213
01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:14.024
Your associate?

1214
01:09:14.275 --> 01:09:16.569
Yes. my associate.

1215
01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:18.445
Now. sit.

1216
01:09:19.446 --> 01:09:20.281
Both of you.

1217
01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:33.252
You're gonna be sorry.

1218
01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.324
Kimmy. what is this?

1219
01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:05.534
There is no Kimmy

1220
01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:06.827
anymore.

1221
01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:08.787
What are you talking about?

1222
01:10:08.787 --> 01:10:11.498
[door opening]

1223
01:10:11.498 --> 01:10:12.041
[door closing]

1224
01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:12.791
Here he comes.

1225
01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.376
Here who comes?

1226
01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:14.835
Shut up.

1227
01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:16.253
I’m getting so sick of your--

1228
01:10:18.964 --> 01:10:19.298
Boo!

1229
01:10:20.591 --> 01:10:24.136
[footsteps...]

1230
01:10:24.136 --> 01:10:25.679
Why do they always act
like they don't know

1231
01:10:25.679 --> 01:10:27.348
how much stronger
we are than them?

1232
01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:29.099
[footsteps...]

1233
01:10:29.099 --> 01:10:30.601
I swear to God. you're
gonna end up just

1234
01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:32.311
like your friend out back bitch.

1235
01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:36.649
[footsteps...]

1236
01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:40.611
You mean me. partner?

1237
01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:44.240
Oh. Albie. what's the matter?

1238
01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:45.991
You look like you've

1239
01:10:45.991 --> 01:10:47.201
just seen a ghost.

1240
01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:50.204
You're

1241
01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:51.830
dead.

1242
01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:55.668
Your force can’t kill me

1243
01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:57.336
human.

1244
01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.428
What the hell. man?

1245
01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:35.457
Third one.

1246
01:11:35.916 --> 01:11:37.126
The human lights. please?

1247
01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:39.253
My filters are destroyed.

1248
01:11:39.336 --> 01:11:40.087
Oh. yes.

1249
01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:40.629
Yeah.

1250
01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:51.390
Much better.

1251
01:11:51.515 --> 01:11:52.224
Thank you.

1252
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.685
What?

1253
01:11:55.102 --> 01:11:56.145
What are you?

1254
01:11:56.228 --> 01:11:58.147
We are what you humans

1255
01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:00.274
refer to as aliens.

1256
01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.234
But soon you will

1257
01:12:02.234 --> 01:12:04.278
revere us as gods.

1258
01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:06.822
And you creatures will be
our humble subordinates

1259
01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:08.991
benefiting from our
noble presence.

1260
01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:11.035
It's not easy finding

1261
01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:14.330
an inhabitable world with
a secondary species like

1262
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.790
yours just waiting
to be conquered.

1263
01:12:17.082 --> 01:12:18.625
Yeah. believe me.

1264
01:12:18.959 --> 01:12:20.794
If you knew of all the
shitty galaxies we

1265
01:12:20.794 --> 01:12:22.046
had to pass through
to get here.

1266
01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.756
even you'd feel sorry for us.

1267
01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:26.216
So try not to waste
our time. okay?

1268
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:29.053
Well.

1269
01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:34.767
say something.

1270
01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:41.732
Kimmy. I don’t know what the
hell is going on right now.

1271
01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.525
You're not a part of this.

1272
01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:45.402
Just tell them to let us go.

1273
01:12:45.486 --> 01:12:46.862
We told you already

1274
01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.531
Your Kimmy doesn't exist.

1275
01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:51.658
I've assumed her
physical appearance.

1276
01:12:55.829 --> 01:12:56.580
You're Kimmy.

1277
01:12:57.081 --> 01:12:57.790
no more.

1278
01:12:58.457 --> 01:12:59.458
Half of your neighborhood.

1279
01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:00.209
no more.

1280
01:13:01.001 --> 01:13:02.461
Your city's law enforcement.

1281
01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:03.295
no more.

1282
01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:04.505
Geez.

1283
01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:06.673
What does it take to get
through to you people?

1284
01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:09.468
Let me know. okay. so we
can get this all over with.

1285
01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:11.387
and take off these ugly masks.

1286
01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:13.013
Hey. speak for yourself.

1287
01:13:13.097 --> 01:13:14.139
I don’t look so bad.

1288
01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:14.890
You

1289
01:13:15.265 --> 01:13:16.058
tell us

1290
01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:18.602
how to access the
collective intelligence

1291
01:13:18.685 --> 01:13:20.312
so we can tap into the hive

1292
01:13:20.312 --> 01:13:22.898
mind of your little species.

1293
01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.525
Take control.

1294
01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.069
Then we all live
happily ever after

1295
01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:29.196
without having to start a war.

1296
01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:30.864
Sound like a plan?

1297
01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:33.575
What an honor

1298
01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:36.829
it must be for you creatures
to aid in rebuilding this

1299
01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:39.540
world for beings like us.

1300
01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:42.584
So tell us how to tap into the
hive mind and we won’t kill you.

1301
01:13:43.001 --> 01:13:44.086
How's that for a deal?

1302
01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:46.839
Fat chance you're gonna
get them to talk.

1303
01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:48.215
The two of you have been
with them all night.

1304
01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:49.591
and caused nothing but trouble.

1305
01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:52.094
Hey. now. we were doing
all right before you sent

1306
01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.178
them back to us.

1307
01:13:53.178 --> 01:13:56.140
We wanted to find the access
without confrontation.

1308
01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.933
Watch your tone
with your superior.

1309
01:13:58.225 --> 01:14:00.477
I sent these dumb chips
over here to you.

1310
01:14:00.477 --> 01:14:01.478
wrapped in a bow.

1311
01:14:01.645 --> 01:14:03.230
primed for interrogation.

1312
01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:05.023
And what did you
do with my gift?

1313
01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:07.693
You were beaten and buried

1314
01:14:08.193 --> 01:14:09.111
by a human.

1315
01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:12.114
Yeah. laugh it up.

1316
01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:54.239
Oh. yes.

1317
01:14:54.948 --> 01:14:55.824
Indeed.

1318
01:14:56.825 --> 01:14:57.576
Tell us how to

1319
01:14:57.576 --> 01:14:58.994
access the hive.

1320
01:15:02.706 --> 01:15:04.208
I can't believe this
is happening.

1321
01:15:06.627 --> 01:15:07.753
Believe it.

1322
01:15:10.422 --> 01:15:12.508
Just wait until our leaders
find out that you're here.

1323
01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:15.093
What do you think they're
going to do to you.

1324
01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:18.805
if all it took from me was
a little bottle of scotch

1325
01:15:20.974 --> 01:15:22.017
Your leaders

1326
01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.229
coming together
to save your world.

1327
01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:26.688
Since when?

1328
01:15:27.564 --> 01:15:27.981
No.

1329
01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.526
There seems to be a
fundamental flaw

1330
01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:31.318
in your species

1331
01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:32.528
collective brain.

1332
01:15:33.570 --> 01:15:35.822
Preservation of the world
is not something

1333
01:15:36.406 --> 01:15:37.366
that you do.

1334
01:15:37.741 --> 01:15:38.951
Quite the opposite.

1335
01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:41.870
Which is interesting
because you lack the

1336
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:43.830
intelligence to go
anywhere else.

1337
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:45.874
Your species should
be grateful to ours.

1338
01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:47.167
Come now.

1339
01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:48.835
Give us access.

1340
01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:51.129
Make it easier on yourselves.

1341
01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:55.676
I couldn’t write this shit.

1342
01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:56.802
You.

1343
01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.930
You're the more reasonable one.

1344
01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.099
Tell us what we need to know

1345
01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:03.976
for the benefit of all.

1346
01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:10.482
You leave me no choice.

1347
01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:12.359
Fourth one.

1348
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:14.403
Take the useless one.

1349
01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.488
assume his flesh.

1350
01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.449
and discard his bones
with the others.

1351
01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:21.201
Yes. first one.

1352
01:16:22.786 --> 01:16:23.620
What are you gonna do?

1353
01:16:24.496 --> 01:16:25.455
Keep your hands off me!

1354
01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:32.504
Walk.

1355
01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:34.423
No!

1356
01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:47.269
Wait.

1357
01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:52.316
Albie.

1358
01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:54.318
are you a man?

1359
01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:07.456
Run!

1360
01:17:31.688 --> 01:17:32.439
Albie.

1361
01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:36.777
Albie...

1362
01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:38.862
Where are you?

1363
01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:43.492
I’m coming for you.

1364
01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:45.952
Albie.

1365
01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:47.162
Albie!

1366
01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.332
Albie...

1367
01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:52.501
[Kimmy laughing...]

1368
01:17:55.545 --> 01:17:57.172
[Kimmy laughing...]

1369
01:17:58.423 --> 01:18:08.100
[Kimmy laughing...]

1370
01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:43.051
Funny you decided to run here.

1371
01:18:44.594 --> 01:18:45.220
Just think.

1372
01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:46.054
Soon.

1373
01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:47.931
you're gonna be just like the
rest of your neighbors.

1374
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.767
One last chance.

1375
01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:54.229
Heed the warnings called out
by the bones of your people.

1376
01:18:54.938 --> 01:18:57.399
Tell us how to access the hive.

1377
01:18:59.693 --> 01:19:01.653
We can promise you
and your family

1378
01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:03.113
the highest level of living.

1379
01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.782
Your status amongst the humans

1380
01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:07.325
will be second to none.

1381
01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:11.037
Just tell us how to

1382
01:19:11.037 --> 01:19:13.707
access the hive mind.

1383
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:14.750
You need to understand.

1384
01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:16.334
I can't help you!

1385
01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.922
There is no hive mind!

1386
01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:22.174
Typical.

1387
01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:23.508
Probe him.

1388
01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:25.802
I already have many times.

1389
01:19:25.802 --> 01:19:26.803
There's nothing there.

1390
01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:27.804
All mush.

1391
01:19:27.804 --> 01:19:28.972
Just like the others.

1392
01:19:28.972 --> 01:19:31.016
Try again.

1393
01:19:44.905 --> 01:19:46.072
You know what to do.

1394
01:19:48.742 --> 01:19:49.534
Wait. wait. wait. wait.

1395
01:19:49.534 --> 01:19:50.911
Please. you gotta believe me.

1396
01:19:50.911 --> 01:19:52.287
There is no hive.

1397
01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:53.497
There is no hive.

1398
01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:54.623
There is no hive.

1399
01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:57.959
We're not stupid.

1400
01:19:58.043 --> 01:19:58.960
We can work something out.

1401
01:19:59.085 --> 01:19:59.836
I'm sure there's something

1402
01:19:59.836 --> 01:20:00.295
else we can do.

1403
01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:01.046
Please.

1404
01:20:01.254 --> 01:20:01.797
Please.

1405
01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:03.256
And you were such a
tough guy before.

1406
01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:05.592
Fickle. these creatures.

1407
01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:07.469
You know. judging by this one.

1408
01:20:07.844 --> 01:20:09.846
I'm beginning to think these
humans aren't lying.

1409
01:20:10.555 --> 01:20:12.474
All this time. we thought
they were like bees.

1410
01:20:13.266 --> 01:20:14.976
I'm starting to think
they're more like flies.

1411
01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:18.063
All attracted to the
same smelly shit.

1412
01:20:19.397 --> 01:20:20.440
Make it quick.

1413
01:20:21.566 --> 01:20:23.193
We still have much work to do.

1414
01:20:24.444 --> 01:20:26.279
You're really not

1415
01:20:26.279 --> 01:20:28.156
going to like this. partner.

1416
01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:29.533
No. no. no!

1417
01:20:29.574 --> 01:20:30.116
Wait. wait. wait!

1418
01:20:30.116 --> 01:20:30.951
Please. please!

1419
01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:40.937
[door opening...]

1420
01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:53.575
[footsteps...]

1421
01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:06.504
You got away?

1422
01:22:07.839 --> 01:22:08.673
Where are they?

1423
01:22:11.801 --> 01:22:12.552
They're gone.

1424
01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:16.097
Don't worry about them.

1425
01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:20.393
Really?

1426
01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:21.853
Yes.

1427
01:22:24.064 --> 01:22:25.065
We gotta hurry.

1428
01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:26.733
Pen.

1429
01:22:29.903 --> 01:22:30.779
I'm sorry

1430
01:22:32.238 --> 01:22:33.239
for it all.

1431
01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:36.534
Okay.

1432
01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:38.703
Not right now.

1433
01:22:38.828 --> 01:22:39.955
Help me out here.

1434
01:22:44.167 --> 01:22:46.002
I'm serious this time.

1435
01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.464
I wanna do better

1436
01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:51.257
for you.

1437
01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:56.930
For us.

1438
01:22:59.849 --> 01:23:00.517
Okay.

1439
01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:01.810
Okay.

1440
01:23:02.435 --> 01:23:03.645
Can you come and untie me?

1441
01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:04.896
We have to get out of here.

1442
01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.024
Relax.

1443
01:23:08.566 --> 01:23:11.111
It's all under control.

1444
01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:17.742
I'm gonna take
care of you now.

1445
01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:20.328
Okay?

1446
01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:31.589
I promise.

1447
01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:24.809
Hey. partner.

1448
01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:26.519
Did you guys have fun?

1449
01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:27.729
Yeah!

1450
01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:29.314
They were little angels.

1451
01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:30.356
as always.

1452
01:24:30.857 --> 01:24:32.025
Did you guys enjoy your night?

1453
01:24:32.108 --> 01:24:32.817
Oh. Mom.

1454
01:24:33.193 --> 01:24:35.195
It was out of this world.
