3
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.219
- Sometimes I forget how serious Boss

4
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.289
takes these night missions.

5
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.122
- I know. right?

6
00:00:25.123 --> 00:00:26.709
It's just a training exercise.

7
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.060
The man needs to calm down.

8
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.740
- Hold up. Pocketman.

9
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.849
Where's Miniskirt?

10
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.059
- She's checking out the front.

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.893
Why?

12
00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.706
- Well. Boss is all the way back there.

13
00:00:38.707 --> 00:00:42.689
you already took out Painkiller. so...

14
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.359
- So that means Hackawackie
is the only one inside

15
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.659
guarding the flag!

16
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.889
- Exactly! Wait. flag?

17
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.722
- Call it what you want.

18
00:00:50.723 --> 00:00:53.273
this is basically just
capture the flag agent style.

19
00:00:58.162 --> 00:00:59.659
- That's why I'm not good at it.

20
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.719
- How many times have I told
you never let your guard down?

21
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.719
- Go! Get Miniskirt.

22
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.896
You guys can take on Hackawackie.

23
00:01:06.897 --> 00:01:08.179
- Are you sure?

24
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.012
- Just go!

25
00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:10.113
I got this.

26
00:01:11.478 --> 00:01:12.929
- You should've worked together.

27
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.469
Now you're in trouble.

28
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.519
- I can handle it.

29
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.435
- Maybe. But it's always a
bad idea to always work alone.

30
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:31.310
- Hey!
- Hey!

31
00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:32.709
- We have to hurry.

32
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.542
Boss is right behind us.

33
00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:36.639
Pocketman took out Painkiller
so we just need to get inside.

34
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.629
get past Hackawackie
and grab the medallion.

35
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.719
- I can't see him through any windows

36
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.719
and we have no idea where
they hid the medallion.

37
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.203
- Then may the force be with
us because we're out of time!

38
00:02:01.122 --> 00:02:02.705
- You can go first.

39
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.829
- It's down that hall.

40
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.279
- But that's where Mark is.

41
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.149
He must have made that noise.

42
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.619
- Yeah. That's probably
where the medallion is.

43
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.929
I would assume he is staying close to it.

44
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.093
- Or it was a distraction.

45
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.553
- It's him.

46
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.309
- You won't always catch
your enemy by surprise.

47
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.299
In reality they might
even be waiting for you.

48
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.369
- Isn't this cheating?

49
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.020
You're like the greatest
fighter ever and I'm a nerd.

50
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.087
- Of course.

51
00:02:56.088 --> 00:02:58.633
Your enemy might also physically
be holding what you need.

52
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.829
- Just think about it.

53
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.969
You two stop me and
continue on with Lindsey.

54
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.929
You can't do this all alone.

55
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.399
- I wasn't trying to do it alone.

56
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.959
I just thought I could
have a head start if I...

57
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.189
- Sacrificed yourself?

58
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.703
Stop with the drama.

59
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.289
- I know you're capable.

60
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.519
It's not about that or your skill.

61
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.999
It's about using your resources.

62
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.479
Don't risk your life just to
finish the mission faster.

63
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.969
- I wasn't risking my life.

64
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.439
- It's always a risk

65
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.969
when you are uncertain of
what you're up against.

66
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.079
There are always consequences
for the wrong choices.

67
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.489
I'm not going to. but if I wanted

68
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.940
I'd catch up with the others.

69
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.259
- That looked like it went well.

70
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.283
- He's reckless.

71
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.099
He means well. but he's just so reckless.

72
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.183
- Give him a chance.

73
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.429
Harrison extended the
program for a reason.

74
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.737
He believes in it and
that means something.

75
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.483
And remember Jay. you
were reckless once too.

76
00:04:20.847 --> 00:04:21.859
- Sorry Lindsey.

77
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.960
Looks like you're out.

78
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.893
- Hey. I thought Jay said no M-locks!

79
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.939
- That was last week.

80
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.879
It's no scanners.

81
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.002
Crap. I need
to pay better attention.

82
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.219
- Yes Cargoboy. I know.

83
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.053
You won.

84
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.804
- I'm sorry. I what?

85
00:04:52.805 --> 00:04:54.049
Won.

86
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.591
- I like how that feels.

87
00:04:55.592 --> 00:04:57.919
Winner. winner chicken dinner.

88
00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.752
Victory.

89
00:04:58.753 --> 00:05:01.159
- You know. this is what gets
you shot in real missions.

90
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.399
right?

91
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.679
- I'm sorry. did you say something?

92
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.763
I don't speak loser.

93
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.859
- I can still make you do push-ups.

94
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.879
- Yep. sure.

95
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.003
- Wait Cargoboy.

96
00:05:11.852 --> 00:05:12.696
Let me down.

97
00:05:12.697 --> 00:05:14.417
I don't have a key.

98
00:05:14.418 --> 00:05:15.918
Cargoboy! Come on.

99
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.399
- Everyone did the homework right?

100
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.689
- Yep.
-  Yes.

101
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.522
- Good. good.

102
00:06:45.523 --> 00:06:46.889
Outstanding!

103
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.729
- From chapter 16. right?

104
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.569
- Um. no.

105
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.999
Today we will be taking a test on

106
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.859
decoding the Pythagorean theorem

107
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.469
and differential equations.

108
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.469
I've also added a few
questions on the topic of

109
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.729
stochastic adaptive control.

110
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:01.563
Hmm!

111
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.969
- What?

112
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.549
- This test will count for
10% of your monthly grade.

113
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:08.382
Trigger warning.

114
00:07:08.383 --> 00:07:10.559
If I get hiccups it is only because

115
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.859
I am so excited for this test!

116
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.923
Any questions?

117
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.539
Can we use a calculator?

118
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.749
- No.

119
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.489
- Can we use the book?

120
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.559
- No.

121
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.349
- Can we use scratch paper?

122
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.319
- No.

123
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.373
- Can we use the internet?

124
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.999
- What do you think?

125
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.832
- All right.

126
00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:32.893
Let's all take a deep breath.

127
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.479
It's quiet time.

128
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.343
Begin!

129
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.169
- Hey. eyes on your own screen.

130
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.083
Now!

131
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.479
- I'm not even cheating.

132
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.209
I haven't even started the test.

133
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.299
I can still hear "Begin."

134
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.133
bouncing off the walls in this room.

135
00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:04.158
- Stupid teachers.

136
00:08:15.316 --> 00:08:16.888
All agents
need to be cautious!

137
00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:18.044
In what we can only assume

138
00:08:18.045 --> 00:08:19.619
was the first of many
Sir Longbottom attacks

139
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.289
the entire office led by Tyler
Gennard has lost their lives.

140
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.451
Please be careful since it
appears that Sir Longbottom

141
00:08:24.452 --> 00:08:27.494
can control more than one mind at a time.

142
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.540
- There's a storm coming.

143
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.349
- I stayed up late working on this.

144
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.109
I didn't think I'd get it done in time.

145
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.260
- I know. I worked all
night on this essay.

146
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.659
- Let me see what you got.

147
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:44.493
- All right.

148
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.382
- What is this?

149
00:08:53.383 --> 00:08:54.699
- I'll be taking this assignment

150
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.773
and we'll be diving
right into the next one!

151
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.703
Dare I ask what my eyes are seeing?

152
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.779
- Sunshine. that's not at all...

153
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.359
- I'm disappointed.

154
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.499
But. I'm always disappointed.
it's nothing new.

155
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.332
- But...

156
00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:13.349
- No. Quiet please!

157
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.339
Today I had planned on going
over the next vocabulary lesson

158
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.172
in the book.

159
00:09:18.173 --> 00:09:20.089
however the Boss himself has asked that

160
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.559
I give you an extra
special research project.

161
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.819
Jay would like you to write a paper

162
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.259
on the history of Sir Longbottom.

163
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.003
This includes birth and known
life achievements up to now.

164
00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.322
- Question.

165
00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:35.242
All right. what is it?

166
00:09:35.243 --> 00:09:37.599
- This sounds more like
a history assignment.

167
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.979
- That's not a question.

168
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.267
- I think what Pocketman was...

169
00:09:41.268 --> 00:09:44.435
Pocketman.

170
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.003
Oh gosh.

171
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.689
Sorry. your name is just
ridiculous. whosever it is.

172
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:01.740
Whichever one of you.

173
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.499
Every time I hear Pocketman

174
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.559
I think about this guy
I knew in high school

175
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.699
who would take mashed
potatoes and put them in his.

176
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.532
it's not important.

177
00:10:09.533 --> 00:10:10.793
What were you saying?

178
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.369
- Anyway. I think what
Pocketman was trying to say was.

179
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.449
why aren't we learning about
Sir Longbottom in a history

180
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.282
class instead?

181
00:10:21.283 --> 00:10:24.179
- Ah. Well. starting
this week you will be.

182
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.369
Diane and I are teaming
up to teach you about

183
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.509
the stranger dangers of Sir Longbottom.

184
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.919
- Shoot.

185
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.369
- I'm out of plain. bland. black coffee.

186
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.349
I'm gonna get some more.

187
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.019
Pick out. read any page in
the book until I get back.

188
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.237
- Any page?

189
00:10:41.238 --> 00:10:43.885
Yeah. yeah.
yeah. blah. blah. blah!

190
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.010
- I swear. she gets crazier every day.

191
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.189
- All right. Let's get started.

192
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.469
What year did Ponce de Leon
discover the fountain of youth?

193
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.743
- Ooh I know this one.

194
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.699
1521.

195
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.369
- That is correct.

196
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.119
- Do I get a Kit Kat bar?

197
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.209
- No. candy quizzes are only on Thursdays.

198
00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.189
- Please continue.

199
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.649
This drama queen will get over it.

200
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.175
- But chocolate sounds so good!

201
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.239
- I should have become a lawyer.

202
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.829
All right. Ponce de Leon first
sailed to Florida in 1513

203
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.029
but was unable to find
the fountain of youth.

204
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.739
He decided to return eight years later

205
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.619
and this time was successful.

206
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.019
Soon after. he was brutally murdered

207
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.909
by the only man who has ever

208
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.059
been able to drink from the fountain.

209
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.839
- Let me guess. Sir Longbottom?

210
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.869
- Yes.

211
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.899
- He's been alive for that long?

212
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.900
So the fountain of youth
does make you live forever?

213
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.979
- Not exactly.

214
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.599
One could essentially become immortal.

215
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.049
but not from one drink.

216
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.299
The liquid has a special property

217
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.819
that reverses the aging process.

218
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.419
So your mind remains intact.

219
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.979
but your body immediately changes.

220
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.769
- Take small drinks over time
and you'll always stay young.

221
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.019
That's genius!

222
00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.279
- Speaking of genius. Sir
Longbottom has an IQ of over 155.

223
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.479
- Does the fountain still exist?

224
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.949
- About a year after it's discovery

225
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.999
Sir Longbottom destroyed the fountain.

226
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.609
He had quickly learned
how the magic worked

227
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.660
and filled a single vile with the liquid.

228
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.713
- Hey Boss.

229
00:12:18.932 --> 00:12:22.519
- Ooh. no way. our badges came in.

230
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.353
Nice!

231
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.010
- I know this is a big day for you.

232
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.479
- How come mine says Trevor
Doyle and not Pocketman?

233
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.999
- Your name is Trevor Doyle bud.

234
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.903
Did you forget?

235
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.599
- Can't you just be grateful?

236
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.739
- No. it's not that.

237
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.804
It's just I like Pocketman better.

238
00:12:39.805 --> 00:12:40.939
You're lucky you're cute.

239
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.213
- All right agents. listen up.

240
00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:46.199
We are gonna continue
where we left off last week

241
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.043
with our discussion of holograms.

242
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.746
Who can briefly describe
to me the science and

243
00:12:52.747 --> 00:12:55.069
practice making of holograms?

244
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.219
- I got this.

245
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.039
A hologram is a three-dimensional image

246
00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.069
that you can see without
the need of special glasses.

247
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.809
It's a recording of a light field.

248
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:05.643
- Very good.

249
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.049
- Show off.

250
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.669
- Okay.

251
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.889
Who can tell me what
holographic interferometry is?

252
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.219
- A technique that enables

253
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.629
static and dynamic
displacements of objects

254
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.509
with rough surfaces to be measured

255
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.989
to optical interferometric precision.

256
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.629
- It can also be used to detect
optical length variations

257
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.749
in transparent media.

258
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:26.829
I'm surrounded by know-it-alls.

259
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.853
- Please turn to page 277.

260
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.719
- Holographic weapon sight?

261
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.769
Cool.

262
00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:38.010
- Holographic weapon sight.
or diffraction sight.

263
00:13:39.116 --> 00:13:42.109
It's a non-magnifying
gunsight that allows the user

264
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.319
to see a holographic reticule image

265
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.173
superimposed on the field of view.

266
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.223
- This is boring.

267
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.760
- This is stuff you need to know.

268
00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.749
Please read the next
five paragraphs quietly.

269
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.059
When you're done I'll
have worksheets for you.

270
00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.649
Any questions?

271
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:01.482
- No sir.

272
00:14:01.483 --> 00:14:02.813
- Good. Read.

273
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.589
Can I join you?

274
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.423
- Sure.

275
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.640
- I can't believe we've been
married almost four months now.

276
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.430
- It seems like it was just yesterday.

277
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.533
So. what's going on?

278
00:14:42.375 --> 00:14:43.325
- What do you mean?

279
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.100
- I can tell something has you stressed.

280
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.519
- I'm fine.

281
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.799
- Okay. I know you Jay.

282
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.739
and also I'm fine is pretty
much universal code for

283
00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.973
I'm not fine.

284
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.793
Is it Sir Longbottom?

285
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:03.852
- Yeah.

286
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:09.053
He took out Tyler and his team of agents.

287
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.649
- I thought he was in hiding?

288
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:13.600
- That's the thing.

289
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.763
No one knows what he's been
doing for the last 30 years.

290
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.623
No one has seen him or
talked to him or anything.

291
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.150
I'm pretty sure he's planning
some kind of attack though.

292
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.725
- Tyler's office is right near here.

293
00:15:29.726 --> 00:15:31.176
You think we are a target!

294
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:32.893
- I do.

295
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.259
But until we have more information.

296
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.283
I think we should treat the
situation like we're at war.

297
00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.382
- Why didn't you tell any of us?

298
00:15:41.383 --> 00:15:43.729
- I didn't wanna freak anyone out yet.

299
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.379
I talked to Harrison
about all this yesterday

300
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:51.380
and he wants Decker and his
team to stay with us for now.

301
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.859
- Does that include Natalie?

302
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.169
- Diane. it's only because
there's safety in numbers.

303
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.259
- So it does include Natalie.

304
00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.079
- That's history.

305
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.059
You know she works for Decker!

306
00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.443
Along with two agents and two trainees.

307
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.720
- They have kids too?

308
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.519
- Well. when Harrison extended the program

309
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.033
he branched out and opened a second base.

310
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.310
- I didn't know that.

311
00:16:16.335 --> 00:16:18.739
And I'm proud of everything
that you have accomplished.

312
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.759
No matter what anyone says.

313
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.710
you always manage to do the impossible.

314
00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:24.243
- Thank you.

315
00:16:26.124 --> 00:16:27.239
- All right.

316
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.703
When are they all getting here?

317
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.423
- First thing in the morning.

318
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.299
Hey. is that your mom?

319
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.139
Yep.

320
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.429
- I can see where you
get your good looks from.

321
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.479
Wait. didn't your mom used to date Boss?

322
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.389
- Dude. we can call her Hex!

323
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.222
- Hex?

324
00:16:47.223 --> 00:16:49.669
- It's like a squished
together one heck of an ex.

325
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.369
- That's not bad.

326
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.720
Don't make this weird.

327
00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.009
- Too late.
- Too late.

328
00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:55.953
- Just so we're all on the same page.

329
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.069
Decker and his agents
are gonna be staying here

330
00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.063
for a few weeks.

331
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.843
There is Fred Spade. Natalie Evans.

332
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.363
and John Rogers.

333
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:12.209
They also have two
trainees. Caleb and Alice.

334
00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.453
- Yeah. is your first
name actually Decker?

335
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.329
- That's just what
everyone always calls me.

336
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.209
My name is Herbert.

337
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.499
- Wow. Okay. I'm gonna call you Decker.

338
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.332
Just curious.

339
00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.619
Continue.

340
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.979
- Anyway. there are
gonna be a lot of people

341
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.659
under this roof.

342
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.149
I ask that we are all kind and respectful.

343
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.189
We don't know what to
expect from Sir Longbottom.

344
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.290
but we wanna be ready.

345
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.420
In the meantime. our day-to-day
will basically stay the same

346
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.019
until we have reason to panic.

347
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.019
- So wait. you're telling me
that we might have to panic

348
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.249
because of the size of a man's bottom?

349
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.082
How long could it be?

350
00:17:50.083 --> 00:17:50.915
I'm confused.

351
00:17:50.916 --> 00:17:51.973
- Not really.

352
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.829
Before I answer that does
anyone else have any questions?

353
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.549
- I have a question.

354
00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.719
- Yes. Amy.

355
00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.619
- Wait Amy?

356
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.452
What are you...

357
00:18:00.453 --> 00:18:01.769
- I followed everyone in.

358
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:02.939
I wanted to check

359
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.783
and see how your foreign
exchange students are doing?

360
00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.933
- My English is much better.

361
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.949
- Yesh. Jayren is vary good learner man.

362
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.809
- Wow. they sound good!

363
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.339
I'm impressed.

364
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.829
You know. I must admit I wasn't
sure you had it in you Jay.

365
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.733
but you proved me wrong.

366
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.149
- Who are you?

367
00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.819
- I met these kids when they
first arrived from Uganda.

368
00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.319
- I don't know what you're talking about.

369
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.559
- She heard them speak. right?

370
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.519
They were literally just talking.

371
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.719
Is this like an education
joke. because if so.

372
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.552
I'm not amused.

373
00:18:37.553 --> 00:18:39.969
- Amy. can I speak to you outside please?

374
00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.003
- It was very nice to see you both again.

375
00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.799
What was that about?

376
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.849
- She lives next door.

377
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.779
Jay told her we were from
Uganda and can't speak English

378
00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.639
to cover up all her
government-related questions.

379
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.629
It was actually kinda funny.

380
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.289
- Did anybody see her come in?

381
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.239
She just popped up.

382
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.413
What are you doing?

383
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.610
- I don't wanna miss this.

384
00:19:09.119 --> 00:19:10.869
- Brutal. That's hot!

385
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.349
- All right. Listen up!

386
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:25.099
During this time there will be
a lot of us under this roof.

387
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.379
Like Jay said we need you
to take advantage of this

388
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.113
and learn as much as possible.

389
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.189
Classes such as this will be
taken by all of you at once

390
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.419
to try and keep us on schedule.

391
00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.409
Decker's gonna take two of you

392
00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:36.879
and I'll take the other three.

393
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.609
Please split up now and we'll get started.

394
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.760
- You two come with me.

395
00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:42.722
- Hey.

396
00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:43.939
We have to give you a nickname.

397
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.119
- No thank you.

398
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.739
- Probably not cool enough anyway. right?

399
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.219
Just messing with you.

400
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.052
- My dad is an agent.

401
00:19:49.053 --> 00:19:50.962
He thinks that this will be good for me.

402
00:19:50.963 --> 00:19:52.299
- The strongest and most skilled fighter

403
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.249
won't be able to beat
the smartest fighter.

404
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.119
Kyle. show me what you got.

405
00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.449
During this lesson I won't
throw a single punch.

406
00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:59.600
I'm ready when you are.

407
00:20:10.031 --> 00:20:13.269
- I have really good grades
and I'm really smart.

408
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.423
I just don't like to be social.

409
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.729
Anything that makes me talk out
loud to more than two people

410
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.023
makes my face swell up.

411
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.453
- Yeah. okay.

412
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.189
- Lindsey. you're gonna be attacking

413
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:27.689
and Trevor I want you to defend.

414
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:28.739
After a few minutes. we'll swap out

415
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.609
and Caleb you can get a turn.

416
00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:31.969
Let's go.

417
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.159
- This will be interesting.

418
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.629
- Bring it on.

419
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:35.789
- You can't handle me.

420
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.339
- You're joking. right?

421
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.995
- Kyle. what did we learn?

422
00:20:38.996 --> 00:20:41.019
- How to be embarrassed in front of girls.

423
00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:41.999
- How you can give yourself an edge

424
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.059
by wearing out the enemy.

425
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:44.939
- Oh.

426
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.919
- If your opponent wastes
their energy early in a fight

427
00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.739
you can really change the tide later on.

428
00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.719
Alice you're up.

429
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.763
Kyle you defend.

430
00:20:55.281 --> 00:20:57.909
- How do you guys think
Boss's meeting went today?

431
00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.319
- You know. I think it went pretty well.

432
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.479
I kinda zoned out part of the way.

433
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.343
But. I mean.

434
00:21:03.344 --> 00:21:05.103
it was good enough.
- It was good enough.

435
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.184
- Remember Brazil?

436
00:21:07.185 --> 00:21:10.333
- Oh my God. you go so sick.

437
00:21:10.334 --> 00:21:11.639
Sean Connery.

438
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.944
- That's who I thought he looked like.

439
00:21:12.945 --> 00:21:13.926
Who?

440
00:21:13.927 --> 00:21:15.448
- Sean Connery.

441
00:21:15.449 --> 00:21:16.922
.

442
00:21:16.923 --> 00:21:18.659
You know what. never mind.

443
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.039
- Not everywhere.

444
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.848
- I have no clue who that is.

445
00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:23.911
- I have no idea.

446
00:21:23.912 --> 00:21:24.744
- I don't know.

447
00:21:24.745 --> 00:21:26.669
He looks kind of like a pirate.

448
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.827
What? John...

449
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.632
- Rogers.

450
00:21:30.633 --> 00:21:31.819
It sounds like I've heard this name.

451
00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.336
My goodness.

452
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.009
- Everyone quiet.

453
00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:36.842
Quiet please!

454
00:21:36.843 --> 00:21:37.675
Cargoboy shhh!

455
00:21:37.676 --> 00:21:38.809
- Of course.

456
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.893
Don't worry sir. we will handle this.

457
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.203
Everyone listen up.

458
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.036
There has been a Sir
Longbottom spotting close by.

459
00:21:49.037 --> 00:21:51.039
More agents have been killed

460
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.426
and Harrison wants me to handle this.

461
00:21:52.427 --> 00:21:54.299
- What's the plan Boss?

462
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.929
- Trevor. Mark. and I will
go face Sir Longbottom.

463
00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.119
Diane and Decker you will
stay here and be in charge

464
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.033
until I get back.

465
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.319
- I know Trevor is a good fighter.

466
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.859
but is this the best idea?

467
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.929
- Yes. Trevor will be fine.

468
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.949
We need him. and we need
a strong team to stay back

469
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:10.903
just in case.

470
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.713
- Trevor. get your gun!

471
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.399
- We're leaving right
now before Sir Longbottom

472
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.818
has a chance to move.

473
00:22:17.819 --> 00:22:21.857
- And I would just like to say
that the ham was overcooked.

474
00:22:21.858 --> 00:22:22.806
- Be careful. okay?

475
00:22:22.807 --> 00:22:26.579
- And the potatoes were
missing some much needed salt.

476
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.673
- You're eating pasta.

477
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.513
- Good luck you guys.

478
00:23:29.111 --> 00:23:30.969
Come on out!

479
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.649
I've been waiting for you.

480
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.069
- Okay. he definitely saw us.

481
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.943
- Don't be shy. that's it.

482
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:40.513
It's Jayden. right?

483
00:23:41.822 --> 00:23:44.449
Now. I know why you're here.

484
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.173
so please keep your
comments to yourselves.

485
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:49.813
Let me guess.

486
00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.299
Oh. yes.

487
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:56.039
I have the right to
remain silent and so on.

488
00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.423
- He's reading our minds.

489
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.199
- Good for you.

490
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.849
Actually. Jayden. I'm only reading yours.

491
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:08.979
See. I want to know everything about you.

492
00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.699
What makes you tick?

493
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.719
Why are you so important?

494
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.970
- I don't think I follow.

495
00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:18.009
- You and I have been
getting in each other's way

496
00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.263
for a very long time.
and yet we've never met.

497
00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.803
I use people to get what I want.

498
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:29.953
You make it difficult for
those people to deliver.

499
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.059
Now. I know what you're
thinking. literally.

500
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.203
And yes. Pyro Ed is one of those people.

501
00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:44.273
You see. everybody works
for somebody. except me.

502
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.630
I'm at the top

503
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.113
and you've pissed in my Cheerios!

504
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.493
- He's kind of a jerk.

505
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.623
- Jay. something doesn't
feel right about this.

506
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.433
- It's all right.

507
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.429
- Do you really think you can hurt me?

508
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.729
Jayden. the queen knighted
me. and not because

509
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.204
she wanted to.

510
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.049
- I don't think it matters.

511
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.943
- So naive.

512
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.819
I had hoped you would be
different. maybe even a challenge.

513
00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.289
But you're not.

514
00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:21.363
You're average.

515
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.759
You're just like all
the others who have died

516
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.667
merely for breathing in my direction.

517
00:25:33.718 --> 00:25:35.885
Let me show you something.

518
00:25:38.993 --> 00:25:40.973
Just like that. it could be over.

519
00:25:42.972 --> 00:25:45.743
I pull the trigger. you die.

520
00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.940
Mark tragically takes his own life

521
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.169
while I rip this child to pieces.

522
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.070
- If we work together we can
finish this before it starts!

523
00:27:00.688 --> 00:27:01.799
- Help!

524
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.969
- Mark!

525
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:03.802
Are you okay?

526
00:27:03.803 --> 00:27:05.409
What happened?

527
00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:06.276
- It's my leg.

528
00:27:06.277 --> 00:27:10.169
- Are Jay and Trevor both hurt too?

529
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.249
- Trevor and Jay are dead.

530
00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:13.425
- No. you're lying.

531
00:27:13.426 --> 00:27:14.258
- Diane!

532
00:27:14.259 --> 00:27:15.091
- Get off me.

533
00:27:15.092 --> 00:27:15.924
You're lying.

534
00:27:15.925 --> 00:27:17.800
- Diane. get it together.

535
00:27:19.482 --> 00:27:23.902
- Sir Longbottom was more
powerful than we could imagine.

536
00:27:23.903 --> 00:27:25.149
I still don't wanna believe it.

537
00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:29.079
but we were insects compared to him.

538
00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:29.912
- That's enough.

539
00:27:29.913 --> 00:27:30.745
I know you've been through a lot.

540
00:27:30.746 --> 00:27:31.629
but there are children here.

541
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:33.579
They don't need to hear this right now.

542
00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:34.830
- It's too late for that.

543
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:37.703
- Trevor is dead?

544
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.583
Why didn't you protect him?

545
00:27:44.441 --> 00:27:46.343
- It just. it happened so fast.

546
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.659
We were completely overpowered.

547
00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.309
- We all need to take a minute and relax.

548
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.489
Sir Longbottom is probably
gonna be on the move.

549
00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.859
We need to strike when
he least expects it.

550
00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.079
- If Mark. Trevor and
Boss couldn't stop him.

551
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.289
then what chance do we have?

552
00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.449
- There has to be a way to outsmart him.

553
00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.763
- He has an IQ of over 155.

554
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.079
Does anyone have an idea?

555
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:09.912
- Kyle!

556
00:28:09.913 --> 00:28:11.319
Anyone?

557
00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.153
I'm serious.

558
00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:15.223
We're all gonna die.

559
00:28:22.895 --> 00:28:25.215
- How could he be gone. mom?

560
00:28:25.216 --> 00:28:27.136
Why would anyone ever do that?

561
00:28:27.137 --> 00:28:28.137
- It's okay.

562
00:28:29.038 --> 00:28:30.966
Some people are just bad.

563
00:28:30.967 --> 00:28:33.179
You try to change them and you can't.

564
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.299
That's just the way they are.

565
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:40.300
- What are we gonna do
now that Jay is. you know?

566
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:42.419
Dead.

567
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.373
- We're gonna call Harrison

568
00:28:43.374 --> 00:28:46.169
and then we're gonna
tell him what happened.

569
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.963
Oh. I wouldn't do that.

570
00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:50.889
- Who the hell are you?

571
00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:51.809
- I'm Rosie.

572
00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.029
Sir Longbottom sent me.

573
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:53.930
Oh. did he?

574
00:28:53.931 --> 00:28:54.763
Easy Diane.

575
00:28:54.764 --> 00:28:55.977
What do you want?

576
00:28:55.978 --> 00:28:57.739
- I just want my master to be happy

577
00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.090
and my master wants you
all out of the picture.

578
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.319
Slow down. babe!

579
00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.259
Pyro Ed has this whole
place rigged to blow.

580
00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.389
If I press this button.

581
00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.749
it's gonna get really hot in here.

582
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:12.178
Face it. who doesn't love a little heat?

583
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:34.199
I'll be honest. Sir Longbottom
didn't actually tell me

584
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.949
to kill you unless you got in my way.

585
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.999
All he cares about is the shatter stick.

586
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.969
- I'm not about to just give that away.

587
00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.696
- Of course not. but that's your warning.

588
00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:50.709
- Wait. what if the shatter stick

589
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.259
is destroyed in the explosion?

590
00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.069
- Well then. can I have it?

591
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.319
No. you can't.

592
00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.403
- That's a risk Sir
Longbottom is willing to take.

593
00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.149
- Was something supposed to happen?

594
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.063
- Dammit Pyro!

595
00:30:33.846 --> 00:30:34.679
- Ah!

596
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.873
I had wondered when you would wake.

597
00:30:41.243 --> 00:30:44.652
Your dreams. they were fascinating.

598
00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.853
It's all right.

599
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.690
I didn't give you any injuries
that won't heal over time.

600
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.423
Now to business.

601
00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.879
Although I had hoped for more.

602
00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.853
you seem like a bright enough fellow.

603
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.317
I'm looking to build an
army and I need something.

604
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.225
- I'm not gonna help you.

605
00:31:09.226 --> 00:31:10.476
- Shut up!

606
00:31:10.477 --> 00:31:13.883
Oh do remember. I can
control your every thought.

607
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.173
- Okay.

608
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.579
Okay I'll listen!

609
00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.343
- You'll do more than that.

610
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.593
You're mine now.

611
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.733
I own you.

612
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.093
You work for me.

613
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.843
- Yes. master.

614
00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:51.643
- As I was saying. I need something.

615
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:55.849
For centuries. I've
watched people searching

616
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:58.273
for a true leader and never finding one.

617
00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.393
It is my destiny to rule.

618
00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.619
And I will have vengeance upon this Earth

619
00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.363
and all those who oppose me.

620
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.519
Those who know their place will help me

621
00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.633
to build a better tomorrow.

622
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.133
- Yes. master.

623
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.545
What do you need from me?

624
00:32:21.546 --> 00:32:22.722
- Spectrum!

625
00:32:35.076 --> 00:32:38.149
- We've never faced anything like this.

626
00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:40.239
- Now let's not panic.

627
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.102
The minute we start to panic

628
00:32:41.103 --> 00:32:43.669
is when we might as well just give up.

629
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.089
Harrison is right.

630
00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.229
- We still outnumber Sir Longbottom.

631
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.649
- Sir. with all due respect he killed Jay

632
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.093
without breaking a sweat.

633
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:55.299
Don't forget this guy has mind powers.

634
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.869
He can control people's thoughts
and the objects around him.

635
00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:00.419
We don't have anything
that can go up against

636
00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:01.473
something like that!

637
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.269
- I think we need to plan an attack

638
00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.070
before the situation gets any worse.

639
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.473
The more agents we can get
to help us. the better.

640
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.139
- He'll know we're coming.

641
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.129
- We could set a trap.

642
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:15.219
- Sir Longbottom seems
like the kind of guy who

643
00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.220
doesn't do anything himself
unless he absolutely needs to.

644
00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:22.239
- I think a trap is a good place to start.

645
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.329
At least it's an idea.

646
00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:25.339
The problem is...

647
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.640
- The problem is it's
an idea that won't work!

648
00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.853
Look Diane. I'm sorry. but
I've seen this guy up close.

649
00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.013
- That's enough.

650
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:41.139
Tomorrow. I will be
meeting with my assistants

651
00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.579
and the other leaders of the agency.

652
00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.223
I do think that what we do
next needs to happen soon.

653
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.949
But I wanna hear it from them first.

654
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:54.379
If they agree. then we can
agents from all over the country

655
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.979
to help us.

656
00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.219
The last thing we need is for civilians

657
00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:02.359
to find out about this when
people like Sir Longbottom

658
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.013
aren't supposed to exist.

659
00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:06.913
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.

660
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.931
- Jay?

661
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:27.853
- Such a shame.

662
00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:30.813
You're dying.

663
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.073
How does it feel?

664
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.032
- Why are you doing this?

665
00:34:38.033 --> 00:34:40.349
I thought you were dead.

666
00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.831
- The lord has saved me.

667
00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.714
Lord Longbottom.

668
00:34:48.911 --> 00:34:50.253
Just close your eyes.

669
00:35:10.801 --> 00:35:11.683
- Jay?

670
00:35:14.217 --> 00:35:15.343
You're okay!

671
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.249
I thought you were dead.

672
00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.603
- No. I'm fine.

673
00:35:21.707 --> 00:35:22.757
- What are you doing?

674
00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.217
Something's different.

675
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:29.893
- My master requires an item.

676
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.483
And I'm taking it.

677
00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.349
- You're being controlled.

678
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:37.248
- It feels good.

679
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.573
Sir Longbottom is the gift to humanity!

680
00:35:45.039 --> 00:35:47.033
- Jay put the shatter stick down.

681
00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:49.190
You don't have to do this.

682
00:36:49.729 --> 00:36:50.562
Stop him!

683
00:36:57.707 --> 00:36:59.540
- What was that about?

684
00:37:02.556 --> 00:37:04.433
I thought you said Jay was dead?

685
00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.673
- Worse.

686
00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.420
Sir Longbottom is controlling him.

687
00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:15.180
- Did he try to kill you?

688
00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.073
- Yes.

689
00:37:20.237 --> 00:37:23.533
Without a mind of his own Jayden
just became very dangerous.

690
00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.232
Boss! Hackawackie!

691
00:38:31.441 --> 00:38:32.452
Boss!

692
00:38:35.722 --> 00:38:36.555
Boss?

693
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.253
Anyone?

694
00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.220
You gotta be kidding me.

695
00:38:49.183 --> 00:38:50.353
It's disgusting.

696
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:58.170
- Ah! Excellent work my new apprentice.

697
00:39:00.844 --> 00:39:02.403
I must admit.

698
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:08.323
I didn't expect you to
complete this task so quickly.

699
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:13.069
You are proving to be more
effective than the girl

700
00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.799
or the fire pig.

701
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.200
Thank you master.

702
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:22.229
- Now. I want you to use the shatter stick

703
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.059
to go back in time.

704
00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:26.523
to before Doctor Collin Fantom was killed.

705
00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:30.519
Only then will you be
able to find Spectrum

706
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.143
before the genetic code was
altered into the Fantom Disease.

707
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.632
Understood.

708
00:39:36.633 --> 00:39:39.733
- Once there. you must move quickly.

709
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:47.743
Show me the one's who want to destroy me!

710
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.670
Your friends can prepare all they want.

711
00:39:56.008 --> 00:39:57.233
It makes no difference.

712
00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.960
I think I'll crush their
bones into a fine powder.

713
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.883
Go. Now!

714
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:15.859
- There's a mountain nearby

715
00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.729
with really high chemical readings.

716
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.079
At first I didn't think much about it.

717
00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.519
Then satellite images showed Jay

718
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.353
coming around this side of the mountain.

719
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.999
- Maybe Sir Longbottom has a
secret hideout or something?

720
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.939
- There's only one way to find out.

721
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.206
- You wanna go there?

722
00:40:31.207 --> 00:40:32.783
- It's a good place to start.

723
00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.489
We don't know what Sir
Longbottom is planning.

724
00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:37.759
but now he has the shatter stick.

725
00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.546
- With the scanners picking
up these readings. if your

726
00:40:40.547 --> 00:40:44.379
right. I'd say he's building weapons.

727
00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.930
- Exactly why we need to hurry.

728
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:49.259
- I have a suggestion.

729
00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.203
Two words.

730
00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.973
Nitro Canon.

731
00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.050
- Oh. I like this kid!

732
00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:25.873
- Jayden!

733
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:30.859
What are you doing here?

734
00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:31.760
- We need to talk.

735
00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.660
- You don't look like my Jayden.

736
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:42.203
You look older?

737
00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:50.853
Actually. you look like shit.

738
00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:54.279
How are you doing. buddy?

739
00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.260
- Nothing gets past you.

740
00:41:56.261 --> 00:41:58.070
I am from the future.

741
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:04.180
In my timeline. Sir Longbottom
is controlling my mind

742
00:42:06.192 --> 00:42:08.507
and attempting to take over the world.

743
00:42:09.545 --> 00:42:10.628
- Longbottom.

744
00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.130
He always did have big dreams. didn't he?

745
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:20.869
Spent the last few years
hiding in the shadows

746
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:24.653
and finally the Brit
decides to show himself.

747
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:29.889
- The sad thing is. I think he's been

748
00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:32.490
working on his evil plan
since before this timeline.

749
00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:39.770
and he sent me back in time
to steal Spectrum from you.

750
00:42:41.376 --> 00:42:42.926
He sent you.

751
00:42:47.209 --> 00:42:52.165
Jayden am I dead where you're from?

752
00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.350
I'm afraid so.

753
00:42:58.690 --> 00:42:59.640
Damn.

754
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.989
Look. I haven't
always been a good friend.

755
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:05.731
I've lied to you

756
00:43:05.732 --> 00:43:08.930
and in only a few months
you're gonna lose everything

757
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:11.762
because of me.

758
00:43:11.763 --> 00:43:15.009
I do not
like the sound of this.

759
00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.753
I know now.

760
00:43:16.754 --> 00:43:20.483
That what I did or will do. it's wrong.

761
00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:25.649
I don't wanna die. Jayden.

762
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.239
I don't deserve to die!

763
00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.799
We all have that fate.

764
00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.653
We all have to face that day.

765
00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.709
We've been through a lot together.

766
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:37.639
I can't stop Sir Longbottom alone.

767
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.629
- Why don't you just get
Mark or Diane to help you?

768
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:45.630
- Because I came here to tell you.

769
00:43:47.184 --> 00:43:48.609
that I'm sorry.

770
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:52.223
- Damn you.

771
00:43:55.425 --> 00:43:57.199
You know what the funny thing is Jayden.

772
00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.467
I can't even be mad at you.

773
00:44:03.906 --> 00:44:05.213
I guess I will later. but.

774
00:44:09.409 --> 00:44:10.833
We've always been brothers.

775
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:19.349
I see you're still
wearing that stupid hat.

776
00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:20.233
- Everyday.

777
00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:25.713
- You know. I don't even
remember why I gave that to you.

778
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:27.543
I do.

779
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:29.523
That's what matters.

780
00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:36.529
- Fine. how can I help you with all this?

781
00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.620
I need you
to give Diane a message.

782
00:44:38.621 --> 00:44:39.739
- Okay.

783
00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.129
- I think that if we go back in time

784
00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:45.259
before Sir Longbotton drinks
from the fountain of youth.

785
00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.919
that we can kill him.

786
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.579
- Isn't that how he got his powers?

787
00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:50.059
Supposedly?

788
00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.459
A side effect
from the fountain?

789
00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.982
Yes.

790
00:44:53.983 --> 00:44:55.809
- Why not just go back and kill him now?

791
00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:58.009
- I have to go back to the future first.

792
00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.842
'Cause if I kill him now.

793
00:44:58.843 --> 00:45:01.369
then he never would have
sent me on this mission.

794
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:04.059
- You'll be stuck in an endless loop.

795
00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.110
- Tell Diane to wait.

796
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.523
Tell her to wait until
she can't wait any longer.

797
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.969
This needs to be a last resort

798
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:13.720
because there's 400 years of
time we're tampering with.

799
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:17.743
Imagine what would happen
with just that one change.

800
00:45:19.261 --> 00:45:21.237
- Okay. I'll tell her.

801
00:45:23.059 --> 00:45:25.689
Is there anything else you'd like?

802
00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:27.409
- Remember that memory gum?

803
00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:28.242
Yeah.

804
00:45:28.243 --> 00:45:29.289
- That you designed?

805
00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:30.123
- What about it?

806
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:33.023
- I'm gonna need that.

807
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:35.502
- Why?

808
00:45:35.503 --> 00:45:36.639
Because when I get back.

809
00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.719
Sir Longbottom's gonna
control my mind again

810
00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.570
and we can't let him know about this plan.

811
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:43.733
- Makes sense.

812
00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:55.740
Now remember. you better take it now.

813
00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.927
It only erases the last
10 minutes of your memory.

814
00:46:06.146 --> 00:46:07.813
- Thank you. Collin.

815
00:46:10.794 --> 00:46:12.211
- Good luck. buddy.

816
00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.633
- Hello.

817
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:10.169
- I recognize you!

818
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.579
- I've never seen you before.

819
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.319
- You were that cutie with
Jayden and the other man.

820
00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.289
You foolishly tried to
defeat the dark lord!

821
00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:18.579
- How do you know that?

822
00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.699
- My mind is connected to Sir Longbottom.

823
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.499
Everything he sees I see.

824
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.149
What I feel. he feels.

825
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:25.799
Pain or pleasure.

826
00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.339
He'll be very pleased
when I bring you to him.

827
00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.674
- That's not gonna happen.

828
00:47:29.675 --> 00:47:32.109
- The dark lord has eyes everywhere.

829
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.499
If I fail. someone will take my place.

830
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.129
You can't even trust your friends.

831
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:37.485
- The dark lord. what is he Voldemort?

832
00:47:37.486 --> 00:47:39.439
Wait! What did you say?

833
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:40.489
- Come with me kid.

834
00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:41.609
No one can save you.

835
00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:42.710
- What did he do?

836
00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.959
- Now. tell me where he is.

837
00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.813
- I'm not telling you anything.

838
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.569
- Where is he?

839
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:03.433
- Go to hell.

840
00:48:05.107 --> 00:48:05.939
- Okay.

841
00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:10.219
Okay. He keeps his weapons
in a cave just south of here.

842
00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:13.159
Follow this trail and you'll
come to an abandoned shed.

843
00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.243
Sometimes he works on new weapons there.

844
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:18.417
He knows you're coming.

845
00:48:18.418 --> 00:48:19.640
You're dead.

846
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:36.246
- What happened?

847
00:48:36.247 --> 00:48:37.893
- I don't know. master.

848
00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.883
I don't remember.

849
00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:43.883
- Did I lose control of you?

850
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.250
I'm having trouble reading your thoughts.

851
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:50.523
This concerns me.

852
00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:57.570
Let's go back. but this
time we'll do it together.

853
00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.943
Wait. I'm sensing something.

854
00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.150
Show me the other side of the mountain.

855
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:17.919
Prepare yourself. my apprentice.

856
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.093
We have guests!

857
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:43.513
So glad you didn't just give up.

858
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:48.639
You know. when I killed
those other agents.

859
00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.033
they begged for their lives.

860
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:53.609
Not you though.

861
00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:55.313
You ran away!

862
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:58.020
- We all have off days.

863
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:00.123
- Coward!

864
00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.039
- Now you're just making me mad.

865
00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.453
Kyle. you're up.

866
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:24.563
- Marvelous!

867
00:50:26.949 --> 00:50:29.349
- That was enough power
to blow up a small town.

868
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:31.513
- This is bad.

869
00:50:33.412 --> 00:50:34.936
- Is that it?

870
00:50:34.937 --> 00:50:36.563
Is that all you've got?

871
00:51:31.167 --> 00:51:32.000
- Trevor!

872
00:51:38.183 --> 00:51:39.940
- Jay. please.

873
00:52:09.229 --> 00:52:11.396
- You should be proud boy.

874
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:16.939
I can see the fire in your eyes.

875
00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:19.323
Burning! Growing!

876
00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:24.993
But you've still got a lot
to learn about true power.

877
00:52:39.961 --> 00:52:41.809
- What? Where am I?

878
00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:42.642
Jay?

879
00:52:42.643 --> 00:52:43.475
- What's going on?

880
00:52:43.476 --> 00:52:44.308
- It's time.

881
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:45.230
What are you talking about?

882
00:52:45.231 --> 00:52:46.063
What happened to you?

883
00:52:46.064 --> 00:52:47.369
- Doesn't matter.

884
00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:48.519
- Years ago Collin came to me

885
00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.009
and said that you had
showed up with a plan

886
00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:51.739
to stop Sir Longbottom.

887
00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:52.929
- I did?

888
00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:54.399
You said that if
we travel to the past to

889
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.759
before he drinks from the fountain

890
00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.389
then we may be able to kill him.

891
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:58.699
I wanted to say something all this time.

892
00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.419
We could have avoided all
the pain and death he caused.

893
00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:02.252
but...

894
00:53:02.253 --> 00:53:03.297
- But what?

895
00:53:03.298 --> 00:53:05.659
- But you also said it
had to be a last resort.

896
00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:08.059
If we do this we're gonna
change 400 years of history.

897
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.660
We don't know what could happen.

898
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:11.889
- I said all of this?

899
00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:13.690
Yes. and then
had your memory wiped.

900
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.313
- If we're here then
you had no other choice.

901
00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.683
- What is this?

902
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.879
Where are the others?

903
00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.023
- Don't worry about them.

904
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.789
Jay.

905
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:22.993
- Whoever you are. you're not good enough.

906
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:40.263
- No. no. no.

907
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.810
This wasn't supposed to happen.

908
00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:46.539
We're gonna get help. okay?

909
00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:47.889
We're gonna get help.

910
00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:49.290
There's not enough time.

911
00:54:51.778 --> 00:54:53.246
Just look at me.

912
00:54:53.247 --> 00:54:56.164
- No. don't say that. okay?

913
00:54:56.165 --> 00:54:58.115
I'm not ready to say goodbye. please.

914
00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.497
Don't say goodbye.

915
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:03.807
I love you Diane.

916
00:55:06.185 --> 00:55:07.889
- Please stay with me.

917
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:10.409
Stay with me. Jay.

918
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:11.243
Jay. Jay.

919
00:55:22.272 --> 00:55:23.189
You did it.

920
00:55:24.765 --> 00:55:25.973
It cost you everything.

921
00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:30.489
What am I supposed to tell everyone?

922
00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:32.740
What about Lindsey. you
didn't even tell her.

923
00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:35.713
It's not fair. Jay.

924
00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.543
I'm gonna fix this. promise.

925
00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.379
- Diane. what happened?

926
00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:31.680
Come inside. are you okay?

927
00:56:36.682 --> 00:56:38.029
- No.

928
00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:40.899
Can Jay and I have some privacy please?

929
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:42.829
- Oh. uh yeah.

930
00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:43.663
Don't mind me.

931
00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:47.136
What is it?

932
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:49.889
- It's just really nice to see you.

933
00:56:49.890 --> 00:56:53.209
- Wait. there's something
different about you.

934
00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:54.939
- Look. before things get more complicated

935
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.729
I have to give you something.

936
00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:58.689
Do you remember working
on the shatter stick?

937
00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:00.489
- Um. Yeah.

938
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:01.539
- But Harrison and the scientists

939
00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:03.029
they said it had to remain classified

940
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:04.119
so you never got to use it?

941
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.299
- Where are you going with this?

942
00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:07.489
You stole it?

943
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:08.669
- Not exactly.

944
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:09.959
- Harrison is gonna fire you!

945
00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.599
- Leave Harrison to me.

946
00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:16.600
But listen. your life is
going to be cut short.

947
00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:20.139
And I know that you don't wanna hear that

948
00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.140
and I shouldn't even be telling you. but

949
00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.210
promise you'll come visit me.

950
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:28.909
Because I need you in my life.

951
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:31.461
And we still have time
to be together here.

952
00:57:31.462 --> 00:57:33.749
But where I'm from.

953
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:34.629
promise me!

954
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:35.462
- Oh. Of course.

955
00:57:35.463 --> 00:57:36.296
Yeah!

956
00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:39.213
- I have to go.

957
00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:44.743
I love you so much.

958
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:52.700
- What just happened?

959
00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:01.719
Was she from the future?

960
00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.945
- Yes. she was.

961
00:58:05.946 --> 00:58:06.996
- Is everything okay?

962
00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:09.188
- I don't think so.

963
00:58:10.797 --> 00:58:12.703
but I don't think I'm
supposed to say anything.

964
00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:16.300
- If you're sure Jay.

965
00:58:17.965 --> 00:58:21.440
- More than ever. I feel lost.

966
00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:26.803
- Well I'm gonna change the topic.

967
00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.472
While you two were talking

968
00:58:28.473 --> 00:58:30.160
I got an interesting notification.

969
00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.639
Remember the guy that Harrison listed

970
00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.053
as the agency's number
one most wanted criminal?

971
00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.859
The Viper Sniper?

972
00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:40.409
- Well yeah.

973
00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:41.493
What about him?

974
00:58:42.898 --> 00:58:44.619
- Turns out a few agents
actually got some background

975
00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:45.479
on the guy.

976
00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.709
- All we knew before is
that he could shoot a gun.

977
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:51.039
- With ridiculous aim!

978
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.303
Seriously! This is good stuff.

979
00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.699
He joined the military when he was 18.

980
00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.743
he got married. he had a son.

981
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:03.943
And he left his family when
his son was only three.

982
00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:05.979
- What happened to the wife?

983
00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:09.173
- No idea until now.

984
00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.853
Turns out she passed and
left the kid on the streets.

985
00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:16.973
- That's too bad.

986
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:22.133
I know how hard it is
to grow up like that.

987
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:24.619
I wonder if he ever made it.

988
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:25.740
We have everything.

989
00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:28.889
Social security number.

990
00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:31.673
previous addresses. bank records.

991
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:33.779
we even have a name.

992
00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:34.613
Oh yeah?

993
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:37.760
So. what is the Viper Sniper's real name?

994
00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:40.253
- Jessie Doyle.

995
00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:48.383
- Collin?

996
00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.192
Is that you?

997
00:59:50.193 --> 00:59:54.143
- Diane. you look terrible.

998
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:57.819
Is everything all right?

999
00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:59.083
I've had quite a day.

1000
01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:04.905
But how are you. why are you...

1001
01:00:04.906 --> 01:00:05.739
- Here?

1002
01:00:07.779 --> 01:00:09.129
You look a little confused.

1003
01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:15.409
I can only assume that you and Jay

1004
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:17.509
paid Sir Longbottom a visit.

1005
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:18.989
Am I right?

1006
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:19.823
- Sir who?

1007
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:24.039
What are you guys talking about?

1008
01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.090
- Jay didn't make it.

1009
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.033
- What?

1010
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:29.703
That's terrible news.

1011
01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:37.253
I'm so sorry. Diane.

1012
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:40.063
- It's okay.

1013
01:00:41.056 --> 01:00:43.156
I have a feeling we'll see him again soon.

1014
01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.540
But how are things here?

1015
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.569
- Sad now. thanks.

1016
01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:52.229
Just found out my best friend is dead!

1017
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:54.973
- A toast. to Jay!

1018
01:00:58.361 --> 01:01:01.500
A man who brought out the
best in everyone around him.

1019
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.519
He was so full of love. it spilled over

1020
01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.949
and gave the rest of us a boost.

1021
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:09.783
- Here. here!

1022
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:16.950
- And lastly. a man that was
willing to give it all up.

1023
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.373
so that we. I.

1024
01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:28.840
could have a second chance.

1025
01:01:31.594 --> 01:01:33.837
To Jay. one of the greats!

1026
01:01:48.773 --> 01:01:51.609
He was always
getting me in trouble.

1027
01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:54.539
I remember my
first day at The Academy.

1028
01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.647
He ran straight into me.

1029
01:01:59.513 --> 01:02:02.297
I remember one time
I tried to touch Jay's hat.

1030
01:02:02.298 --> 01:02:03.847
he pulled a gun on me.

1031
01:02:06.758 --> 01:02:08.424
Don't touch the hat!

1032
01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.519
Good evening. Boss.

1033
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.879
- Boss?

1034
01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.353
- Yeah that's what
Pocketman said to call you.

1035
01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.002
You're in charge now. right?

1036
01:02:27.003 --> 01:02:28.461
- I was always in charge.

1037
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:26.702
- Stop!

1038
01:03:26.703 --> 01:03:27.853
I'm trying to study here.

1039
01:03:31.669 --> 01:03:32.502
Trevor!

1040
01:03:38.313 --> 01:03:39.145
- Ow!

1041
01:03:39.146 --> 01:03:39.989
What was that for?

1042
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:41.323
- How do you like it?

1043
01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.759
- I thought we were studying.

1044
01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.773
- Can't hurt to take a quick break.

1045
01:03:47.774 --> 01:03:49.274
Trevor!

1046
01:05:08.290 --> 01:05:09.719
Just stay back. sweetie.

1047
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.176
It's been too long.

1048
01:05:12.177 --> 01:05:13.739
How long has it been?

1049
01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:14.742
Like two weeks.

1050
01:05:14.743 --> 01:05:17.239
See. like I said!

1051
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.250
Check out my new fire pack.

1052
01:05:33.027 --> 01:05:34.744
Now it's a party.

1053
01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.679
Cool. huh?

1054
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.404
I've been working on this bad boy for...

1055
01:05:56.405 --> 01:05:57.979
What do you want?

1056
01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:59.140
Look what's that?

1057
01:05:59.663 --> 01:06:00.744
Burn!

1058
01:06:19.503 --> 01:06:21.626
That's not fair.

1059
01:06:23.928 --> 01:06:25.678
What are we
gonna do with this guy?

1060
01:06:27.899 --> 01:06:29.559
Let's tie him up
and put him in the garage.

1061
01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.643
That's what Jay would do.

1062
01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:10.362
We're going for a walk

1063
01:07:10.363 --> 01:07:12.406
did you wanna come with us?

1064
01:07:12.407 --> 01:07:13.789
- No. it's late.

1065
01:07:13.790 --> 01:07:14.839
I was gonna head home soon.

1066
01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.419
- Are you sure?

1067
01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.252
- Come on.

1068
01:07:17.253 --> 01:07:19.329
I'm gonna explain functions
of a complex variable

1069
01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:21.669
and bilinear transformation.

1070
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:22.699
I'm excited!

1071
01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.159
- I think I'll pass.

1072
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.010
You two have fun.

1073
01:07:59.861 --> 01:08:01.709
- Oh geez. you startled me.

1074
01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:02.953
- I'm sorry.

1075
01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.939
I didn't think anyone was awake.

1076
01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:07.829
- Is everything okay?

1077
01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:09.209
- Of course.

1078
01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:10.133
Now off to bed.

1079
01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:25.297
- Shit!

1080
01:08:25.298 --> 01:08:26.363
I have to do this tonight.

1081
01:08:26.364 --> 01:08:27.774
Where is he?

1082
01:08:27.775 --> 01:08:28.607
- Have to do what Freddie?

1083
01:08:28.608 --> 01:08:29.630
Who are you talking to?

1084
01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.293
- What's going on out here?

1085
01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:41.290
What are you doing Fred?

1086
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.162
- It's finally time for
a change around here.

1087
