Excuse me. uh. this may sound crazy.

34
00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:01.788
but I couldn't help but notice you
from across the room.

35
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.169
- Hello.
- Hi.

36
00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.464
Love your smell.

37
00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:13.467
- I brought you something.
- What'd you get me?

38
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.052
- What'd I get you?
- Hm?

39
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:16.553
What'd I get you?

40
00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:19.306
Boom!

41
00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.433
- My favorite! Oh!
- Mm-hm.

42
00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:24.227
Why eat regular when you can go Tropical?

43
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.355
- Yeah. Tropical.
- Mm-hm!

44
00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:27.397
All right. what you got?

45
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:28.732
- What you been drawing?
- Mm!

46
00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.317
- Oh!
- Not yet.

47
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.319
Is Bhoomi finally ready
to become a butterfly?

48
00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:33.403
- No.
- Uh-huh.

49
00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:34.905
She's perfectly fine just as she is.

50
00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.615
- Stop trying to change her.
- All right.

51
00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.784
So Roxy's tonight?

52
00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:41.078
- Or I was thinking...
- Mm-hm?

53
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.664
how about we stay in and I can cook?

54
00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:47.417
- No. thanks.
- What do you mean?

55
00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:50.754
Baby. come on. you think I'll let you
back in the kitchen after last time?

56
00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:53.799
Wait a minute.
that was your mom's branzino recipe.

57
00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:56.218
- Your favorite.
- I don't know what that was.

58
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.303
Never cooking for you again.

59
00:02:58.387 --> 00:02:59.221
Thank you.

60
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.813
I got to go.

61
00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.147
- Why?
- Gotta go.

62
00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:10.857
- I got a meeting.
- Don't go.

63
00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:12.776
Babe. you know I'll be thinking about you.

64
00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.111
I wanna show you something.

65
00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:15.570
Oh.

66
00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:17.322
I knew you were here the whole time.

67
00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:19.032
Twist ending. How?

68
00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:21.326
Well. I could feel you.

69
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.538
Also. I could see you
in that reflection with my eyes.

70
00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.790
Damn. I look good!

71
00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.667
Oh. that's just an artist's touch.

72
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.628
- You're a lucky lady.
- I am. I'll see you later?

73
00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.380
- Love you so much.
- Love you.

74
00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:35.507
- Bye.
- Bye.

75
00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:50.188
Hey. look out!

76
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.941
Oh. my God!

77
00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:56.862
Get help!

78
00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.559
<i>Hey. it's your sister.</i>

79
00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.311
<i>doing my daily check-in.</i>

80
00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:32.314
<i>How's it going today? How's Mom and Dad?</i>

81
00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:34.149
<i>Wanna give me a call and catch up?</i>

82
00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.404
Ma?

83
00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:42.657
<i>Suzy again. You know what?
You didn't call me back. but that's fine.</i>

84
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:43.575
Papa?

85
00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.785
<i>What do you do
with Mom and Dad at night there?</i>

86
00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:46.870
<i>I'm just curious.</i>

87
00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.955
<i>Do you guys hang out
and watch </i>British Bake Off?

88
00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:54.961
<i>I know you're still grieving.</i>

89
00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:58.215
<i>but I just wanted to say
I really miss you.</i>

90
00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.804
<i>Hey. it's Suzy again.</i>

91
00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:08.391
<i>Like the new drawings.
Little dark. though. Don't you think?</i>

92
00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:11.394
<i>Maybe you should come back to the city.
to your room.</i>

93
00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:14.064
<i>which is empty. in our apartment?</i>

94
00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.696
<i>Mira. enough.</i>

95
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.449
<i>You know I'm not great with words.
but John loved you.</i>

96
00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:27.619
<i>And I'm sure he would not wanna
see you stuck like this.</i>

97
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.502
<i>Mom and Dad want their house back!</i>

98
00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.420
<i>Do I have to come and get you?</i>

99
00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:45.845
- Bye. Papa.
- Bye. beta.

100
00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.765
- Drive safely.
- I will. Bye. Mom.

101
00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:53.436
- Okay. I got it. Bye.
- Bye.

102
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.437
- Bye.
- Bye.

103
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.814
- See you. Mom.
- Bye.

104
00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:58.191
Tell Suzy she needs
to text her parents back.

105
00:05:58.275 --> 00:05:59.317
I will.

106
00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:36.771
She's here!

107
00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:42.694
I can't believe
you're still driving John's truck.

108
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:46.156
It still smells like him.

109
00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.824
Oh! Come here.

110
00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:52.203
- No. I get the top.
- Ah!

111
00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:55.165
- I'm stronger than you.
- Okay.

112
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.208

123
00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:04.359
Céline Dion?

124
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.611
Like...

125
00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:11.741
Like. "My Heart Still Goes On."
that Céline Dion?

126
00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.077
Too commercial for you. is it. huh?

127
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.413
If you kept up
with what the kids were saying.

128
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.582
you'd know we were
in the middle of a Célinaissance.

129
00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.836
Drake is talking about getting
a tattoo of her face.

130
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:25.463
- What? How do you know that?
- Instagram.

131
00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:27.924
I should be starting the podcast
for the newspaper.

132
00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:30.218
No. what you should be doing
is leaving my office

133
00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.137
to go work on Céline Dion.

134
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.972
Now. you seem to forget. Rob.

135
00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:36.683
that I've taken a big chance
hiring you. fellow Brit.

136
00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:39.519
But ever since you were
publicly humiliated by that woman--

137
00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:40.603
Elizabeth.

138
00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:43.273
Ever since Elizabeth dropped you
like a stone

139
00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:47.902
just days before your wedding.
well. your work has lacked heart.

140
00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:49.654
Huh.

141
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:54.075
Céline Dion is all about heart. Okay?

142
00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.745
People adore her. I adore her.

143
00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:59.372
So get onboard.
or I'll find someone who will.

144
00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:04.919
- S-A-D. sad.
- Are you joking?

145
00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:07.464
Shut up. It was the only one I could find.

146
00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:13.178
It's just five. I'm gonna lose this game.

147
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.971
Aw! Bernard wrote back.

148
00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.265
Bernard's back in the picture. huh?

149
00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:18.975
Mm... Not quite sure.

150
00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.686
But he wrote.
"See you soon. dot. dot. dot."

151
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.439
With a winky smiley.
Means he wants to see me.

152
00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:27.650
I don't know about that.
Sounds like a blow-off to me.

153
00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.486
What? No. Winky smiley.

154
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.906
That's. like. way more-- --like.
meaningful than. like. a regular smiley.

155
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.449
You know what's crazy. Suzy?

156
00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:37.035
Our parents worked their asses off
to send us to college.

157
00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:39.537
and here we are.
decoding the winky in a smiley.

158
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:42.916
Here you are. ladies.
Two Miras. medium rare.

159
00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:44.918
Wait. what is a Mira?

160
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:48.421
When they put the fries inside the burger.

161
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.882
Mo. you named a burger after me?

162
00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.008
Of course.

163
00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:54.552
I name burgers
after all my favorite customers.

164
00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:57.806
It's good to see you.
God. I missed you around here.

165
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:59.682
You. not so much.

166
00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.142
How you holding up?

167
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:03.561
- You know.
- Yeah.

168
00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:05.647
Takes a long time.

169
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.275
Yeah. I still have a ways to go. I think.

170
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.528
Well. you know. there's no clock.

171
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:12.779
God knows. I...

172
00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:15.949
I still miss Roxy every day.

173
00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:18.451
How do you deal with it. Mo?

174
00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:24.666
Pour a glass of wine.
sit down for dinner.

175
00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.918
and tell her about my day.

176
00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:32.757
Just because she's gone doesn't mean
I can't still tell her about my feelings.

177
00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.052
The ice. it thickens.

178
00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:40.473
Someday. it'll support your weight.

179
00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:41.558
I promise.

186
00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.421
Is there something
I can help you with. Lisa?

187
00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:14.340
You're lucky. I love Céline.

188
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.345
Hughes wanted to make sure
you got one of these.

189
00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.598
No. I have a phone.

190
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.182
No. you have a personal phone.

191
00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:26.686
This is a work phone.
issued by our new corporate overlords.

192
00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.396
I don't wanna deal with another phone.

193
00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:31.316
I took the phone!
Take the phone. It's not a choice.

194
00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.027
And you?

195
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.111
Duh.

196
00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:40.116
- Fine. fine.
- Yeah. Uh. be careful.

197
00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:45.204
There's a rumor Hughes is tracking
everything we say and do on that.

198
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.123
- What?
- Hey.

199
00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:50.168
When are you going to text Jessica?

200
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:53.004
I told her you would.
It's kind of rude to keep her waiting.

201
00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:55.423
- I told you. I'm not looking to date.
- Why not?

202
00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:57.175
You're. like. peaking physically.

203
00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:59.510
You don't wanna be out there
when you're on the decline.

204
00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:01.763
Yeah. she's right.
You know. just let me set you up.

205
00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:04.515
- You're not even on the apps anymore.
- Love isn't real. It--

206
00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:09.062
It's just a bunch of pheromones
that wear off.

207
00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:11.147
Then you get your heart ripped out.

208
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.024
covered in bleach. stomped on.

209
00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:16.402
set on fire in front of your friends
and your family and...

210
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.113
Ew.

211
00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:23.451
Hey. boo. Any reason you left
these things out in the truck?

212
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.624
Well. his mom gave them to me.

213
00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:33.461
I just never opened it.

214
00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.676
What? Wait. No. Suzy.

215
00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:42.011
Come on. it's been two years.

216
00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:06.035
If you weren't my sister. I'd probably
be like. "Whoa. easy there. girl."

217
00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:07.745
but. nah. I totally get it.

218
00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:26.723
<i>Orpheus and Eurydice?</i>

219
00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:29.851
He used to play that for me all the time.

220
00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.520
said that he'd go to hell and back for me.

221
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.400
That's what the opera's about.

222
00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:40.737
Oh. God. He was the best.

223
00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:03.509
He never got the chance.

224
00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:10.850
Okay. This. I don't know.
feels a little unhealthy. maybe?

225
00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:11.851
What's wrong with it?

226
00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:14.020
I'm just wearing
my dead boyfriend's shirt

227
00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:16.481
and the engagement ring
he never got to give me.

228
00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:25.156
Come here.

229
00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:49.430
Okay.

230
00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:52.642
Okay.

231
00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:56.020
Um...

232
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:00.691
Hey. John.

233
00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:09.784
This is just weird. God.

234
00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:16.666
<i>Leans in and he scores!</i>

235
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.084

236
00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:21.879
Hey. John...

237
00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:30.972
I miss you so much.

239
00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:49.073
Yes!

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:51.159
Come on.

241
00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:06.090
Yes!

242
00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:07.758
What?

243
00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:10.052
Oh-- What the hell?

Come on.

248
00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:01.479
- Oh. sorry.
- Sorry.

249
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:10.154
Interesting.

250
00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:13.115
Is she using the leaf to blot her tears?

251
00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:16.202
Well. it would be weird
to give her a tissue.

252
00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:17.703
Look. Mira.

253
00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.498
We make children's books here.

254
00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:22.333
Children. Remember them?

255
00:17:22.416 --> 00:17:25.753
Little people who like to look
at bright pictures and laugh.

256
00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:28.381
Well. maybe it's better to prepare them.

257
00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:31.092
That life will inevitably
crush their hopes and dreams.

258
00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:33.928
They tell us not to pressure creatives.

259
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:37.181
But after two years. I think
I'm allowed to put a little on you.

260
00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:39.725
Molly. could you come in here. please?

261
00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:43.813
Yes. Ms. Valentine?

262
00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:46.023
Mira. this is Molly.

263
00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:47.608
- Hi.
- Big fan.

264
00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:50.194
Molly's a paid intern from NYU.

265
00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:51.779
Scholarship kid.

266
00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:53.447
Raised by a single mom.

267
00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:54.824
That's amazing.

268
00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.702
She'll lose her job
if you don't figure this out

269
00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:59.495
and turn in something we can publish.

270
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:04.458
Oh. And I'll have to sue
for your advance as well.

271
00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:08.004
Thank you. Molly.

272
00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.418
Player.

273
00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:54.675
Hey.

274
00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.677
Lisa. Uh...

275
00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:58.637
Do you wanna talk?

276
00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:01.932
Maybe somewhere private?

277
00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:03.976
Okay.

278
00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:15.613
Look. first of all.
I want to say I'm flattered. really.

279
00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:20.493
It takes a lot of guts
to share your feelings with someone and...

280
00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:21.577
What?

281
00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.247
Hey. uh...

282
00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:29.293
"It's crazy to reach out like this"?

283
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:34.215
"We should be together."

284
00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:35.758
Oh. my God. Gross.

285
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.343
Rob. you could be. like. my dad.

286
00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:40.221
I'm. like. 35. I'm 35.

287
00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:42.056
- Ugh.
- Not much older than you are.

288
00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:44.433
I'm pretty cool.

289
00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:46.519
Yeah. whatever. I just thought--

290
00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:49.230
- You didn't send me a text?
- What text?

291
00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:55.945
No way. I don't flirt like that.
I'm. like. good at it.

292
00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.530
I think they're nice.

293
00:19:58.447 --> 00:19:59.281
Oh!

294
00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.577
Whoa. that's super sad.

295
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.414
Who is sending me these texts?

296
00:20:06.497 --> 00:20:08.416
Someone's smishing you.

297
00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.501
Phishing. but by text.

298
00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:13.754
First. they lure you in.
then they ask for your credit card number.

299
00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.007
- Delete it.
- Yeah.

300
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:43.909
Céline. you're arguably more popular today
than when you started.

301
00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:46.996
How do you think you've managed
to stay relevant for so long?

302
00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:49.081
Hm. What a question.

303
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:51.167
Do you ever stop and ask yourself

304
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.254
why people continue to read your work
as a middle-aged male journalist?

305
00:20:56.172 --> 00:21:00.676
Maybe it's because if the work is good.
it's timeless. Yeah?

306
00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:04.847
Miss Dion. it's been over a decade
since you've toured in the States.

307
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.265
I'm curious. Why now?

308
00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:08.893
For five years. it's been tough.

309
00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:11.604
Raising my children
after the loss of their father.

310
00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:14.523
the love of my life. my husband. Réne.

311
00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:16.567
And at the same time.

312
00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.361
I didn't want to just sit around
and be sad.

313
00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:23.657
So I decided to hit the road
and do what I love.

314
00:21:23.741 --> 00:21:24.617
Tell me about it.

315
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.743
What was that?

316
00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:29.371
Nothing. Just--
I was responding to a text.

317
00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:30.998
- Sorry.
- Oh. Cool.

318
00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:33.125
Feel free to talk with friends
if I'm boring you.

319
00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.252
No. no. no. it wasn't-- I mean...

320
00:21:36.086 --> 00:21:37.505
I wouldn't say it was a friend.

321
00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:43.969
Do you have a question for me?

322
00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:44.887
Um...

323
00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:48.849
Yes. Yeah. yeah. Sure.

324
00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:49.934
Um...

325
00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:52.353
Miss Dion...

326
00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:55.773
Céline. you sing a lot about love.
obviously.

327
00:21:55.856 --> 00:21:57.858
For example.
in "That's the Way It Is." you say:

328
00:21:57.942 --> 00:22:00.319
"When you're ready to go
and your heart's left in doubt.

329
00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:03.572
don't give up on your faith.
love comes to those that believe it."

330
00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:06.242
But in "When I Fall in Love."

331
00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:09.662
you say. "In a restless world like this.
love is ended...

332
00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:12.248
before it's begun."

333
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.708
What's the question?

334
00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:18.629
Well. do you really believe
in all these things you sing?

335
00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:23.801
You obviously know nothing about it.

336
00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:26.136
What?

337
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.346
Love.

338
00:22:30.391 --> 00:22:33.519
Céline. are you taking your children
on tour with you?

339
00:22:41.819 --> 00:22:43.070
Who are you texting?

340
00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:45.781
No one.

341
00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:48.784
This the same "no one"
that you were texting last night?

342
00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:50.160
Yes. actually.

343
00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:53.289
But trust me.
it's totally not what you think.

344
00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:54.957
Mira. there is nothing wrong

345
00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.834
with putting yourself
back out there again.

346
00:22:56.917 --> 00:23:00.004
Oh. my God. stop. please.
I wouldn't even know where to start.

347
00:23:00.087 --> 00:23:01.338
Oh. oh. oh!

348
00:23:01.422 --> 00:23:03.340
Well. it's kind of amazing
that you say that

349
00:23:03.424 --> 00:23:06.093
because your sister. who loves you.

350
00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:08.220
who's kind of awesome and got your back.

351
00:23:08.304 --> 00:23:10.848
might have already started you on an app.

352
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:12.474
Sorry. what?

353
00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:14.310
- I hate apps!
- I know. I know.

354
00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:15.603
They're the worst. But...

355
00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:19.398
you're kind of beautiful. and young.
and you have your whole life ahead of you.

356
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:21.859
You're not allowed to give up on dating.

357
00:23:21.942 --> 00:23:23.193
So just take a look.

358
00:23:24.153 --> 00:23:27.573
What? No. no. I'm not ready for this.

359
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:32.786
Okay. why is every guy shirtless?

360
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.955
I wouldn't talk to any one of these guys.

361
00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:37.416
But you don't have to worry
because it's Bumble.

362
00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:39.043
So the woman makes the first move.

363
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.212
What? What do you think?

364
00:23:43.464 --> 00:23:45.758
No? What about this guy?

365
00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:47.968
Okay. So we do a little right swipe.

366
00:23:48.052 --> 00:23:50.471
- I didn't tell you to swipe.
- Wait. Stop.

367
00:23:50.554 --> 00:23:53.557
It's a match on your first one.
Who even are you?

368
00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:54.642
Oh.

369
00:23:54.725 --> 00:23:56.352
Come on. that is such a sign.

370
00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:58.520
So we just do a little "hey"

371
00:23:58.604 --> 00:24:00.147
- to see what he--
- Don't text him.

372
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.231
- Stop.
- You texted him?

373
00:24:01.315 --> 00:24:03.942
Yes. Oh. my God. he's texting back.

374
00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:06.945
"Nice pic." Mm.

375
00:24:08.197 --> 00:24:09.948
- "Do you wanna go for a drink?"
- No.

376
00:24:10.032 --> 00:24:11.617
- Yes. It's amazing!
- No.

377
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.078
Look. just do it for me. your sister.

378
00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:15.454
who loves you so. so. so much.

379
00:24:15.537 --> 00:24:17.956
- Your happiness is my happiness.
- Shut up.

380
00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:20.000
- One drink.
- You're gonna go?

381
00:24:20.084 --> 00:24:21.710
- If you shut up.
- I promise.

382
00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:23.504
- One drink. Whoo!
- Wow.

383
00:24:24.213 --> 00:24:26.090
- So aggressive.
- I know.

384
00:24:27.675 --> 00:24:29.051
<i>♪ Wherever you go ♪</i>

385
00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:30.260

386
00:24:30.344 --> 00:24:32.930

390
00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:40.813
- Hi. Rob.
- Oh.

391
00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:43.899
You're checking that phone a lot.
You still getting those depressing texts?

392
00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:45.234
- What?
- Lisa told me.

393
00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:47.778
You know what? I don't think
it sounds like a scammer at all.

394
00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:48.737
- Really?
- Mm-mm.

395
00:24:48.821 --> 00:24:51.240
It sounds more like a psychotic stalker.

396
00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:53.992
Or just a really confused old lady.

397
00:24:54.702 --> 00:24:56.870
Don't believe me? Text them back.

398
00:24:56.954 --> 00:24:59.248
I couldn't do that. They're too personal.

399
00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:00.999
Wouldn't want to embarrass
whoever this was.

400
00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:03.127
Mm-hm. Oh! Oh!

401
00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.921
Has psychotic grandma sent another one?

402
00:25:07.256 --> 00:25:11.009
"Guess who's going
to that awful hipster bar Rendez tonight?

403
00:25:11.093 --> 00:25:13.345
Please don't judge.
I already feel so guilty.

404
00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:14.680
And I'm definitely not ready.

405
00:25:14.763 --> 00:25:17.015
But I guess if I don't force myself.
I'll never be."

406
00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:19.643
That is a great bar. I know that.
That's a good pick-up spot.

407
00:25:19.727 --> 00:25:21.687
- I'm going.
- What? Where?

408
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:22.771
Why?

409
00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:25.357
You're going now? Why?

410
00:25:26.066 --> 00:25:28.068
You're always telling me
to get back out there.

411
00:25:28.152 --> 00:25:29.987
Yeah. no. this is true.

412
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.656
but these are texts
from a literal stranger.

413
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.950
Yeah. but they speak to me.

414
00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:36.160
They speak to you?

415
00:25:36.243 --> 00:25:39.705
No. What are you doing. Rob?
You sound like an insane person right now.

416
00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:43.333
Look. I just need
to put a face to these texts. okay?

417
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:46.587
That's all.

418
00:25:49.506 --> 00:25:51.133
You're gonna go with him. right?

419
00:25:53.594 --> 00:25:56.180
Yeah. right. okay. Thanks.

420
00:25:57.222 --> 00:25:58.974
Do you think this is healthy?

421
00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:01.643
How are you gonna know
if it's even them or not?

422
00:26:01.727 --> 00:26:02.853
I have no idea.

423
00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:05.272
- You got this.
- Cool plan.

424
00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:07.274
You've got it. You look gorgeous.

425
00:26:07.357 --> 00:26:09.234
- I'm feeling you.
- I don't know if I can do it.

426
00:26:09.318 --> 00:26:11.320
- You can. it's just a drink.
- Suzy.

427
00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:14.156
Come on. No. no. no.
You go in there. okay?

428
00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:17.159
He's a dud. you text me. I'll call you.

429
00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:19.787
we'll just say there's a family emergency.
No problem.

430
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.039
- Keep your phone on. The whole time.
- Swear to God.

431
00:26:22.122 --> 00:26:23.582
All night. Pinky swear.

432
00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:26.585
- I got it. Okay. I'll do it.
- Ah. ah. ah.

433
00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:28.587
Mira.

434
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.381
I know.

435
00:26:32.883 --> 00:26:36.261
Hey. Listen. you know I loved John
like a brother. right?

436
00:26:37.679 --> 00:26:41.183
Okay. so I'm saying this
with the hugest amount of love

437
00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:42.976
and the greatest amount of respect.

438
00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.395
This guy tonight doesn't have
to be your soulmate.

439
00:26:45.479 --> 00:26:47.272
You don't even have to like him.

440
00:26:47.356 --> 00:26:48.649
If the body's good.

441
00:26:48.732 --> 00:26:50.651
you go in there. you get the D.

442
00:26:50.734 --> 00:26:52.903
There's not gonna be any getting of any D.

443
00:26:52.986 --> 00:26:54.112
Trust me. you need the D.

444
00:26:54.196 --> 00:26:56.031
You make it sound
like a vitamin deficiency.

445
00:26:56.114 --> 00:27:00.118
Yeah. you do. Vitamin D deficiency.
Come on. go get in there.

446
00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:02.412
Hey. none of those
"Would you rather" questions.

447
00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:04.915
- I know you.
- Everyone loves my questions.

448
00:27:04.998 --> 00:27:07.251
Nobody loves your questions.

449
00:27:07.334 --> 00:27:09.294
Come on. You got this. You got this!

450
00:27:09.378 --> 00:27:10.546
- Okay. okay.
- Whoo!

451
00:27:11.255 --> 00:27:14.132
Mira's got it. She's looking fly. Whoo!

452
00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:15.384
Yeah. okay.

453
00:27:18.053 --> 00:27:19.096
Oh. gross.

454
00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:23.016
This shit is like the musical equivalent
of Cheez Whiz.

455
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.645
Uh. Rob. check out that guy there.
Don't look. but look.

456
00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:27.729
Don't...

457
00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:30.357
- Yeah?
- What do you mean?

458
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.569
Maybe he is your. uh. texter.

459
00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:35.737
I thought you said
they were from some psycho granny?

460
00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:37.114
Or a sensitive silver fox.

461
00:27:37.197 --> 00:27:38.615
He has super kind eyes.

462
00:27:38.699 --> 00:27:41.952
- Would you like to go talk to him?
- Why would you insult me. Rob?

463
00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:44.329
I'm here for you. buddy. Nobody else.

464
00:27:44.413 --> 00:27:46.665
How could you say that to me. Rob?

465
00:27:53.422 --> 00:27:54.423
What?

466
00:28:00.137 --> 00:28:01.430
Wait. wait.

467
00:28:02.055 --> 00:28:04.016
- I think I've seen her before.
- Okay. cool.

468
00:28:18.405 --> 00:28:20.198
- Mira.
- Yes. Hi.

469
00:28:20.282 --> 00:28:21.199
Hi.

470
00:28:21.283 --> 00:28:22.367
Please.

471
00:28:27.873 --> 00:28:29.583
Another skinny marg.

472
00:28:31.335 --> 00:28:34.087
Everyone thinks personal training
is all about the body.

473
00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:39.217
But you can't do 400 weighted squats...

474
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.928
without a brain.

475
00:28:42.179 --> 00:28:43.221
Well...

476
00:28:43.305 --> 00:28:46.058
You really can't do anything
without a brain.

477
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:47.851
You get it.

478
00:28:51.855 --> 00:28:54.107
Two Ketel One martinis.

479
00:28:54.191 --> 00:28:57.027
Compliments of the gentleman over there.

480
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.153
Oh.

481
00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.280
Would you just go talk to him already?

482
00:29:00.364 --> 00:29:01.949
Rob. stop!

483
00:29:03.867 --> 00:29:05.744
I will be two minutes.

484
00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:10.332
I like this song.

485
00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.628
Tight bassline.

486
00:29:14.711 --> 00:29:15.921
Sorry. one second.

487
00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:27.432
- All good over there?
- Gonna put my phone on silent.

488
00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:32.354
- I have a question for you.
- Hm?

489
00:29:33.021 --> 00:29:36.358
Would you rather live
your entire life with...

490
00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:40.737
silent but uncontrollable gas.

491
00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:45.117
or loud. uncontrollable sneezes?

492
00:29:46.326 --> 00:29:47.411
Neither.

493
00:29:47.494 --> 00:29:50.122
Just pick one. Or you get both.

494
00:29:50.205 --> 00:29:51.206
Stop it.

495
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:54.209
It's too much pressure.

496
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:58.296
I have his number.

497
00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.048
- Uh. unlock your phone.
- Oh.

498
00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:04.553
Let's just check into the numbers
and make sure this guy is not your texter.

499
00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:06.179
And it is not.

500
00:30:06.263 --> 00:30:08.682
Praise be. because we are
totally gonna smash later.

501
00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:10.350
- Good.
- Yeah.

502
00:30:10.434 --> 00:30:12.060
- The boys' room.
- Yeah.

503
00:30:14.021 --> 00:30:15.522
Oh. my...

504
00:30:23.864 --> 00:30:25.115
- Wait.
- Mm-hm.

505
00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:30.704
- It think it might be her.
- Oh. really?

506
00:30:30.787 --> 00:30:32.330
- Because she's on her phone?
- Yeah.

507
00:30:32.414 --> 00:30:34.249
He's texting. The barperson's texting.

508
00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:36.501
Could be anybody.
Why do you think it's her?

509
00:30:36.585 --> 00:30:37.419
Huh.

510
00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.006
Does that guy look like
he does too many push-ups?

511
00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:44.593
No. that's not too many push-ups.
It's the perfect amount of push-ups.

512
00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:47.012
She's not having a good time with him.

513
00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:49.181
No. no. no. she is not.

514
00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:51.933
She is so miserable
and so lucky you're here.

515
00:30:52.017 --> 00:30:52.851
Oh!

516
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.978
They're leaving.

517
00:30:56.104 --> 00:30:57.606
I bet I could bench-press you.

518
00:31:05.989 --> 00:31:07.199
You know what. Rob?

519
00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:09.367
Uh...

520
00:31:09.451 --> 00:31:12.120
This night is not a total loss. you know?

521
00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:13.288
Because...

522
00:31:14.456 --> 00:31:15.665
I'm gonna get laid.

523
00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:28.261
Maybe we just take it a little slower?

524
00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:30.138
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

525
00:31:30.222 --> 00:31:32.265
- Sure. No problem.
- Okay. Okay.

530
00:31:41.691 --> 00:31:43.735
What are you doing?

531
00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:45.612
I'm going slower.

532
00:31:46.154 --> 00:31:47.948
Well. that's not what I meant.

533
00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:51.159
Wait. are we not gonna have sex
at your place?

534
00:31:51.243 --> 00:31:54.246
No! When did I say that?

535
00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:56.498
Did I give you mixed signals or something?

536
00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:59.835
No. it's fine.
I just wish you would've told me sooner.

537
00:32:00.544 --> 00:32:01.378
Okay.

538
00:32:01.461 --> 00:32:03.964
Are you looking
for another date right now?

539
00:32:04.047 --> 00:32:05.966
Um. yeah. Yeah.

540
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:09.636
Because you don't want to have sex
and I have to burn off these calories.

541
00:32:09.719 --> 00:32:13.014
- Those drinks had a lot of carbs.
- You know what? Get out.

542
00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:15.851
- Get out. Now. now. now.
- Okay. Okay.

543
00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:19.020
Take a fucking run.
It'll burn off those carbs!

544
00:33:01.563 --> 00:33:02.814
I miss it too.

545
00:33:04.107 --> 00:33:06.026
- Ready?
- Yeah.

546
00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:07.110
Let's go.

547
00:33:11.907 --> 00:33:14.075
Rob Burns. <i>New York Chronicle.
</i>Nice to meet you.

548
00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:15.952
Yeah. The rude texter.

549
00:33:19.039 --> 00:33:20.165
That's me.

550
00:33:21.791 --> 00:33:23.251
Let me see your hands.

551
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.921
- These?
- Please.

552
00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:28.924
Come over and give me your hands.

553
00:33:37.307 --> 00:33:38.141
Hm.

554
00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:42.437
Strange. You have very manly hands.

555
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:45.857
- And yet. you act like a little boy.
- What?

556
00:33:46.983 --> 00:33:49.653
- I don't act like a little boy.
- Let me ask you a question.

557
00:33:49.736 --> 00:33:52.864
- And I want you to be totally honest.
- Okay.

558
00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:55.283
Are you a fan of my music?

559
00:33:57.327 --> 00:33:58.912
- Yes.
- Liar.

560
00:33:58.995 --> 00:34:01.331
- Why do you say that?
- You don't even know how to hear it.

561
00:34:01.414 --> 00:34:03.083
No offense...

562
00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:04.876
Céline.

563
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.671
I think I can grasp lyrics like. um...

564
00:34:08.255 --> 00:34:10.966
"If I hear you breathe.
I get wings to fly."

565
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:14.219
Has anyone ever made you feel like that?

566
00:34:16.221 --> 00:34:19.766
Have you ever made someone else
feel like that?

567
00:34:22.811 --> 00:34:24.145
You have. haven't you?

568
00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:26.564
I see it.

569
00:34:27.107 --> 00:34:28.149
I thought so.

570
00:34:29.818 --> 00:34:31.194
A while back. but...

571
00:34:34.364 --> 00:34:35.532
It didn't work out.

572
00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:37.993
And you've been stuck ever since?

573
00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.744
How'd you know that?

574
00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:44.332
Because you have the presence
of a pair of used underwear.

575
00:34:48.962 --> 00:34:51.464
Sit up straight. Sit up straight.

576
00:34:51.548 --> 00:34:54.009
Come on. man. you're with Céline Dion!

577
00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:55.719
- Okay.
- Okay. Mr. Underwear.

578
00:34:56.344 --> 00:34:58.388
Do you have someone
in your life right now?

579
00:35:00.056 --> 00:35:00.890
I...

580
00:35:04.144 --> 00:35:06.813
I think I might have feelings
for someone I've never met.

581
00:35:06.896 --> 00:35:09.649
You are more interesting
than you look. Go on.

582
00:35:48.772 --> 00:35:49.773
Oh. shit.

583
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.839
I feel like I got to know her
through these texts.

584
00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:18.593
You know. maybe I'm just fooling myself.

585
00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:20.929
These texts you're receiving
are saying something.

586
00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:23.348
Things like this don't just happen.

587
00:36:24.224 --> 00:36:25.642
You need to pursue this.

588
00:36:25.725 --> 00:36:26.726
Really?

589
00:36:27.769 --> 00:36:30.772
You don't think it's crazy
to fall for someone like this?

590
00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:34.359
Oh. it might be crazy.
But love doesn't always follow the rules.

591
00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:36.611
Take my situation. for example.

592
00:36:37.237 --> 00:36:39.739
René had always been my manager
my entire career.

593
00:36:39.823 --> 00:36:42.742
But I never thought of him in that way...

594
00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:45.203
until one night in Dublin.

595
00:36:47.288 --> 00:36:48.790
What happened in Dublin?

596
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:51.668
We were there
for the Eurovision song contest.

597
00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:53.837
and it was the night before finals.

598
00:36:54.337 --> 00:36:57.674
I was about to go up to my hotel room
and get a good night's sleep.

599
00:36:57.757 --> 00:37:01.302
And René wished me good night
and gave me a kiss on each cheek.

600
00:37:01.386 --> 00:37:02.720
like he always did.

601
00:37:05.306 --> 00:37:09.686
But on that night.
he stopped ever so briefly at my lips...

602
00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:14.649
and gave me the softest.
sweetest little peck.

603
00:37:16.276 --> 00:37:17.652
And at that moment...

604
00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:20.864
that kiss on the lips
was the answer to everything

605
00:37:20.947 --> 00:37:24.033
that I was feeling deep down inside of me.

606
00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:29.205
It was as if that kiss had unlocked
a secret that had been in our hearts.

607
00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:32.459
I was his.

608
00:37:34.544 --> 00:37:35.753
And he was mine.

609
00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:42.260
Love has a plan
for each and every one of us.

610
00:37:43.178 --> 00:37:45.597
I think these texts
are part of the plan for you.

611
00:37:49.225 --> 00:37:50.268
Time's up.

612
00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:51.769
Oh. Um...

613
00:37:52.854 --> 00:37:54.230
We didn't get to the interview.

614
00:37:54.314 --> 00:37:57.025
Come back to me as a man
and we can try again.

615
00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:59.652
- Yeah. I'm 35.
- Then you still have time.

616
00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:01.946
Love takes courage.

617
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:05.992
Open yourself to the universe
and it'll come rushing in. Rob Burns.

618
00:38:06.075 --> 00:38:07.076
Okay.

619
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.561

Okay.

645
00:40:22.754 --> 00:40:23.838
- Billy. give it back.
- No.

646
00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:26.549
You need to get over this.
This is not healthy.

647
00:40:29.177 --> 00:40:30.511
Just give it to me.

648
00:40:32.889 --> 00:40:34.641
- Billy.
- No. no.

649
00:40:34.724 --> 00:40:37.143
- Give me the phone.
- No. Don't follow me.

650
00:40:37.226 --> 00:40:38.144
I won't chase you.

651
00:40:38.227 --> 00:40:40.104
- Give me the phone!
- Help me. Lisa!

652
00:40:40.188 --> 00:40:41.522
No. Lisa. call HR.

653
00:40:41.606 --> 00:40:43.691
- Give it to me!
- No! Just calm down. okay?

654
00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:45.401
Just calm down. Just breathe. okay?

655
00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:48.780
Because you don't even know
if this is from her. Okay?

656
00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:53.201
Okay. it's from her. Just wait there.

657
00:40:59.374 --> 00:41:00.750
This makes no sense.

658
00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:10.510
"Here. where never is heard
a discouraging word.

659
00:41:11.094 --> 00:41:13.262
is nothing but joy and desire."

660
00:41:15.348 --> 00:41:17.266
It's from <i>Orpheus and Eurydice.</i>

661
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:21.479
The opera? By Gluck?
It's playing at the Manhattan Opera House.

662
00:41:21.562 --> 00:41:24.607
- Sorry. You listen to "opera" now?
- You don't know my life.

663
00:41:25.858 --> 00:41:27.193
Enlighten me. please.

664
00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:31.072
Orpheus travels to Hades
to get back his dead wife.

665
00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:33.491
And he's given permission
to return to Earth with her.

666
00:41:33.574 --> 00:41:36.411
under the condition
that he not look at her face

667
00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:37.829
until they're outta Hades.

668
00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:40.623
- Why?
- I don't know. 'Cause the gods are dicks.

669
00:41:40.707 --> 00:41:44.168
Anyway. Orpheus can't resist
but look at Eurydice's face

670
00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:48.089
because people are weak
and love makes fools out of everyone.

671
00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:50.508
So he ends up losing her. All over again.

672
00:41:51.467 --> 00:41:52.802
I'm gonna go see it.

673
00:41:53.553 --> 00:41:57.390
- Why?
- Obviously. it has meaning for her.

674
00:41:58.015 --> 00:42:00.810
Oh. okay. Uh...
How do you know if she's even going?

675
00:42:00.893 --> 00:42:03.062
And if she does.
you still won't know when.

676
00:42:04.272 --> 00:42:06.023
I'll just keep going until she shows up.

677
00:42:06.107 --> 00:42:07.108
Oh-ho.

678
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.651
You'll just keep going?

679
00:42:09.318 --> 00:42:12.071
That is... That is so crazy.

680
00:42:14.407 --> 00:42:15.408
Yeah.

681
00:42:16.492 --> 00:42:17.869
Yeah. but like she said...

682
00:42:19.579 --> 00:42:21.372
love makes fools of everyone.

683
00:44:17.989 --> 00:44:18.990
Do I know you?

684
00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:20.825
I...

685
00:44:23.244 --> 00:44:24.328
I'm not sure.

686
00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:28.416
- I'm sorry.
- I mean. everyone starts as strangers.

687
00:44:29.292 --> 00:44:31.168
I don't know a lot of people.

688
00:44:31.961 --> 00:44:34.380
- Okay.
- We both like comfortable footwear.

689
00:44:34.463 --> 00:44:36.549
Um... Oh!

690
00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:40.303
Jordan 1s. I see.
I'm more of an 11s kinda girl.

691
00:44:41.304 --> 00:44:44.056
That's cool. I have thems-- Those...

692
00:44:44.932 --> 00:44:46.559
sneakers. I have sneakers at home.

693
00:44:46.642 --> 00:44:49.896
Nice. I didn't wear mine
'cause they didn't go with this dress.

694
00:44:49.979 --> 00:44:50.980
No.

695
00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.154
- Did you. um... Did you like the show?
- Yes.

696
00:44:58.237 --> 00:44:59.906
- Very much so. actually.
- Huh.

697
00:44:59.989 --> 00:45:00.823
And you?

698
00:45:01.908 --> 00:45:04.076
Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was so...

699
00:45:05.995 --> 00:45:07.121
hopeful.

700
00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:08.623
Hopeful?

701
00:45:09.123 --> 00:45:10.458
- Really?
- Yeah.

702
00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:14.545
Sure. there's a lot of pain and suffering.
but. ultimately. love wins in the end.

703
00:45:14.629 --> 00:45:17.590
There's no joy without the struggle.
they go hand in hand.

704
00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:21.135
Just have faith. Keep looking forward.

705
00:45:22.929 --> 00:45:25.181
At least. that's what I saw.

706
00:45:25.264 --> 00:45:26.682
That's so strange.

707
00:45:27.475 --> 00:45:30.436
I've seen the show so many times
and I never saw it like that.

708
00:45:31.103 --> 00:45:33.606
I guess it's about how you hear the music.

709
00:45:34.732 --> 00:45:36.025
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

710
00:45:37.652 --> 00:45:39.320
Would you like my number?

711
00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:43.699
If you wanna talk more about the show.
or other Jordans.

712
00:45:44.283 --> 00:45:45.159
Um...

713
00:45:45.785 --> 00:45:47.787
- Okay. sure.

718
00:46:07.098 --> 00:46:10.226
You know. just one. For work.

719
00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:11.769
Okay.

720
00:46:11.852 --> 00:46:16.440
- Of course.
- I guess we're not strangers anymore.

721
00:46:18.651 --> 00:46:19.777
I guess not.

722
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.281
Oh! Oh.

723
00:46:25.157 --> 00:46:28.369
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry about it. It's nothing.

724
00:47:13.539 --> 00:47:14.540
Children's books.

725
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:18.461
Cool.

726
00:48:08.052 --> 00:48:09.553
We talked.

727
00:48:09.637 --> 00:48:11.388
- Last night. At the opera.
- Ah.

728
00:48:11.472 --> 00:48:14.391
Well. there we go!

729
00:48:14.475 --> 00:48:16.560
- Okay.
- Shut up!

730
00:48:16.644 --> 00:48:19.146
I know. right?
And it's true. And get this.

731
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:20.356
She thinks...

732
00:48:22.525 --> 00:48:24.110
- I am interesting.
- Ooh.

733
00:48:24.193 --> 00:48:26.445
Really? How do we know this information?

734
00:48:26.529 --> 00:48:28.989
Oh. She texted her
dead boyfriend about me.

735
00:48:29.073 --> 00:48:31.408
- I found his Facebook profile.
- What?

736
00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:36.872
Yeah. He's who she's been texting
this whole time.

737
00:48:36.956 --> 00:48:39.208
I must have the dead boyfriend's number.

738
00:48:39.291 --> 00:48:42.419
Yikes. That's not good.

739
00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:47.341
Oh. my God. it's her.
She's calling me right now.

740
00:48:55.015 --> 00:48:57.017
- He's not picking up.
- Leave a message.

741
00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:59.603
- What do I do? What do I do?
- Answer the phone. Rob.

742
00:48:59.687 --> 00:49:02.731

743
00:49:02.815 --> 00:49:05.401
- Rob. come on. This is unbearable.
- Answer the phone.

744
00:49:06.318 --> 00:49:07.153
Yo!

746
00:49:11.323 --> 00:49:15.035
Hi. Hi. This is Mira Ray.

747
00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:16.787

How are you? I hope this isn't a bad time.

751
00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:32.094
No. No. no. no. I'm just at work.
No. But you're not interrupting anything.

752
00:49:32.178 --> 00:49:35.055
I work to live.

753
00:49:36.098 --> 00:49:38.726

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:41.061
Oh. that's cool.
He's a music critic.

755
00:49:41.145 --> 00:49:42.521
<i>Nice weather we're having.</i>

756
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.443
I love a crisp winter's day
in New York City.

757
00:49:47.526 --> 00:49:50.863
<i>Um... Yeah. I love the weather.</i>

00:49:55.117 --> 00:49:57.578
Hey. I was wondering. do you eat?

760
00:49:58.287 --> 00:49:59.455
He just asked me if I eat.

761
00:50:00.706 --> 00:50:03.626
I mean. I know you eat.
At least. I assume you do.

762
00:50:03.709 --> 00:50:05.544
But some people.
they're just not into food.

763
00:50:05.628 --> 00:50:08.088
They do it because they have to.
Otherwise. they would die.

764
00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:10.341
<i>But I-- I love food.</i>

765
00:50:10.424 --> 00:50:12.635
I can't get enough.
Unless. of course. I'm full.

766
00:50:12.718 --> 00:50:15.221
And then I'm like. "No. I'm all set here."

767
00:50:18.641 --> 00:50:21.977
Yeah. so. specifically.
I was wondering. would you like to eat?

768
00:50:22.061 --> 00:50:23.062
With me?

769
00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:28.025

770
00:50:28.108 --> 00:50:32.738
Uh... Yeah.
I mean. I love food too.

771
00:50:34.531 --> 00:50:36.075
Do you like cheeseburgers?

772
00:50:36.158 --> 00:50:40.663
Are you kidding? Cheeseburgers.
I love cheeseburgers.

773
00:50:40.746 --> 00:50:45.417
Um. I know this cute little spot

00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:58.264
- Okay.
<i>- Well. I'll see you.</i>

778
00:50:58.347 --> 00:50:59.348

Wow. I have no words.

780
00:51:06.438 --> 00:51:08.732
Oh. my God. Congratulations.

781
00:51:08.816 --> 00:51:12.069
You just got yourself a date
the normal way. No apps.

782
00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:14.321
We're meeting for cheeseburgers at 7:00.

783
00:51:14.405 --> 00:51:15.823
That's in. like. 45 minutes.

784
00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:18.284
Perfect. Now you can tell her
about the texts in person.

785
00:51:18.367 --> 00:51:20.661
But if I do that.
she'll never speak to me again.

786
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:23.622
- The truth hurts.
- Rob.

787
00:51:23.706 --> 00:51:25.874
May I see you in my office. please?

788
00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:29.420
Actually. sir. I'm kinda busy.

789
00:51:30.129 --> 00:51:32.298
Rhetorical question. Now!

790
00:51:39.305 --> 00:51:41.807
How is the Céline Dion piece coming along?

791
00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:43.559
Good. Really good.

792
00:51:44.184 --> 00:51:45.686
Anything for me to read?

793
00:51:47.438 --> 00:51:49.898
Uh. not yet. but soon.

794
00:51:49.982 --> 00:51:52.234
Okay. well. that's funny
because I've been noticing

795
00:51:52.318 --> 00:51:55.571
quite a few interesting texts
on your work phone.

796
00:51:55.654 --> 00:51:56.739
What?

797
00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:01.827
I don't even know where to begin.

798
00:52:02.411 --> 00:52:04.163
"My heart is broken.

799
00:52:04.246 --> 00:52:07.291
There's also this aching inside of me."

800
00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:11.086
Doesn't sound very work-related to me.

801
00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:12.796
Those are. um...

802
00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:16.216
song lyrics.

803
00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:20.346
From Céline Dion.

804
00:52:22.931 --> 00:52:23.766
Wow.

805
00:52:26.268 --> 00:52:30.147
Sounds like you've made a connection.
if she's sending you lyrics.

806
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:31.273
Yeah.

807
00:52:31.357 --> 00:52:32.691
Wow!

808
00:52:32.775 --> 00:52:36.945
- I'm holding Céline's lyrics in my hand.
- Yeah. you are.

809
00:52:37.029 --> 00:52:39.448
You know. my wife and I danced
to "Have You Ever Been in Love"

810
00:52:39.531 --> 00:52:40.366
at our wedding.

811
00:52:41.283 --> 00:52:43.285
That's a deep cut. sir.
I did not know that.

- You okay?
- Yeah.

840
00:54:17.004 --> 00:54:19.339
This is not the right time to tell her.

841
00:54:20.132 --> 00:54:22.593
Soon. But not now.

842
00:54:24.136 --> 00:54:25.471

Do you always do that?

00:55:00.172 --> 00:55:02.090
- What?
- Put fries in your burger?

857
00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:03.800
Yeah.

- I have another question for you.
- Mm?

863
00:55:17.439 --> 00:55:18.565
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm?

864
00:55:19.608 --> 00:55:22.528
Would you rather own ten cats

865
00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:25.280
or have a parrot on your shoulder
for 22 hours a day?

866
00:55:27.699 --> 00:55:29.076
What kind of question is that?

867
00:55:31.954 --> 00:55:34.081
I was...

868
00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:35.165
A bird.

869
00:55:35.749 --> 00:55:37.251
Wins hands down every time.

870
00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:39.378
I mean. I don't get cats.

871
00:55:39.461 --> 00:55:41.213
One minute you're cool. and the next...

872
00:55:41.296 --> 00:55:42.839
- Scratching your eyes out.
- Totally.

873
00:55:42.923 --> 00:55:44.675
- They're evil.
- Unpredictable.

874
00:55:44.758 --> 00:55:46.593
- Yes. Agreed.
- Mm.

875
00:55:46.677 --> 00:55:48.512
- Pirate bird all the way.
- Aargh.

876
00:55:51.306 --> 00:55:52.641
You're fun to talk to.

877
00:55:52.724 --> 00:55:54.810
Thanks. But the accent does all the work.

878
00:55:57.062 --> 00:55:58.063
Can I ask...?

879
00:55:58.146 --> 00:55:59.147
Yes.

880
00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:03.485
Your ring.

881
00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:08.699
I'm sorry.

882
00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:10.325
- I should've taken it off.
- No.

883
00:56:10.409 --> 00:56:12.619
I just. somehow. uh...

884
00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:18.542
I just didn't wanna start with.
"Hi. I have a dead boyfriend."

885
00:56:19.084 --> 00:56:21.378
We were very much in love.

886
00:56:21.461 --> 00:56:24.923
and he bought a ring
and died before he could propose.

887
00:56:27.092 --> 00:56:28.176
I'm sorry.

888
00:56:29.386 --> 00:56:31.179
I was engaged once.

889
00:56:32.306 --> 00:56:34.141
Oh. really. What happened?

890
00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:35.392
I don't know.

891
00:56:36.351 --> 00:56:38.687
She decided she didn't want
to go through with it.

892
00:56:39.354 --> 00:56:40.564
The week before the wedding.

893
00:56:41.189 --> 00:56:43.191
- Jeez.
- The worst part of it was...

894
00:56:46.778 --> 00:56:49.239
being left with all these questions.

895
00:56:51.742 --> 00:56:55.495
To be honest. I may have gone crazy
trying to figure out what went wrong.

896
00:56:56.121 --> 00:56:57.664
Well. did you figure it out?

897
00:57:01.084 --> 00:57:03.879
Love is a mystery.

898
00:57:06.298 --> 00:57:08.342
And in a restless world like this one...

899
00:57:11.845 --> 00:57:13.138
it can be ended...

900
00:57:14.556 --> 00:57:15.807
before it's even begun.

901
00:57:16.975 --> 00:57:17.976
You're funny.

902
00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:20.479
Come on.

903
00:57:21.229 --> 00:57:22.230
Okay.

904
00:57:28.487 --> 00:57:30.030
<i>Okay. okay. one more. one more.</i>

905
00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:33.492
Um... Would you rather say
everything you're thinking

906
00:57:33.575 --> 00:57:36.244
or never say anything at all?

907
00:57:39.164 --> 00:57:39.998
Mm...

908
00:57:40.666 --> 00:57:41.958
- What? No way.
- Mm-hm!

909
00:57:42.042 --> 00:57:44.503
- What? What?
- Mm. Mm!

910
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:48.674
What. you're telling me you'd choose
to always say everything you're thinking?

911
00:57:48.757 --> 00:57:50.967
Yeah. I already do.

912
00:57:51.051 --> 00:57:52.552
Okay. what are you thinking right now?

913
00:57:58.350 --> 00:57:59.976
I think you're very cute.

914
00:58:05.065 --> 00:58:07.734
Why do you love these questions so much?

915
00:58:09.027 --> 00:58:13.490
'Cause they are very telling of people
and they cut through the bullshit.

916
00:58:18.078 --> 00:58:22.624
Do you think you could fall in love
with someone just through their words?

917
00:58:26.503 --> 00:58:28.296
Yeah. sure.

918
00:58:29.256 --> 00:58:30.966
But you know what they say.

919
00:58:31.049 --> 00:58:33.635
Actions speak louder than words.

920
00:58:33.719 --> 00:58:34.845
- Ah.
- Mm-hm.

921
00:58:34.928 --> 00:58:38.557
Well. what about these actions?

922
00:58:40.559 --> 00:58:42.561
What. like... Oh. we're dancing?

923
00:58:42.644 --> 00:58:46.148
- What. are you gonna leave me hanging?
- No. I'm not. I don't know what to do.

924
00:58:47.899 --> 00:58:48.900
- Whoo!
- Oh.

925
00:58:48.984 --> 00:58:50.444
- All right.
- Ah.

926
00:58:51.319 --> 00:58:52.529
- Wow!
- Ah.

927
00:58:52.612 --> 00:58:54.573
- That was smooth.
- Thank you.

928
00:58:54.656 --> 00:58:56.700
You're really feeling this music.
aren't you?

929
00:58:56.783 --> 00:58:58.660
Yeah. This isn't...
Playing my favorite song.

930
00:58:58.744 --> 00:58:59.578
- Okay.
- Oh.

931
00:58:59.661 --> 00:59:01.705
Whoa.

932
00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:13.008
You know he stopped playing. right?

933
00:59:14.426 --> 00:59:15.427
Oh.

934
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:18.388
Well. I still hear the music.

935
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:44.790
Have you always been this much into music?

936
00:59:44.873 --> 00:59:46.082
Oh. yeah. definitely.

937
00:59:46.166 --> 00:59:49.544
My mom. she filled the house
with it growing up.

938
00:59:50.337 --> 00:59:51.963
- She played everything.
- Really?

939
00:59:52.047 --> 00:59:53.673
Classical. rock.

940
00:59:54.466 --> 00:59:56.802
- traditional Scottish. jazz.
- Wow.

941
00:59:56.885 --> 00:59:59.429
- That's really cool.
- Yeah. she was pretty cool.

942
00:59:59.513 --> 01:00:01.223
What about you? What are you into?

943
01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.642
I love hip-hop.
Hip-hop's my favorite.

944
01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:04.810
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

945
01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.020
Cardi B all day every day.

946
01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:09.564
- Have you heard of her?
- She's very catchy.

947
01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:15.862
What?

948
01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:20.075
I like you.

949
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:24.329
Um...

950
01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:25.956
I like you too.

951
01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.294
Mira. I...

952
01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.551
I need to tell you something.

953
01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:38.635
What?

954
01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:48.186
I do not want this date to end.

955
01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:52.399
Well. who says it has to?

956
01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:56.152
Well. it is morning now.

957
01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.821
Which is crazy.

958
01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:02.367
Wow. Yeah. it is.

959
01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:03.952
Um...

960
01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:07.914
Look. it was a really great night
and. uh...

961
01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.959
I'll see you around. Text me.

962
01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:12.752
See you.

963
01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:15.630
Or...

964
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.551
just 'cause we're crazy kids. um...

965
01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:24.264
we could go back to our places.
shower up. change.

966
01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:27.475
and maybe meet tonight at mine

967
01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:28.852
to make dinner?

968
01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:30.729
Yeah. that sounds great.

969
01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:32.731
- Yeah?
- I warn you. I'm not much of a cook.

970
01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:34.608
Oh. perfect. Me neither.

971
01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:39.195
Okay. so tonight.

972
01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:40.280
Tonight.

973
01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:09.893
- Mmm. Mmm!
- Mmm.

974
01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:13.563
- Good stuff.
- That company wanted us to fail.

975
01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:15.148
Oh. totally.

976
01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:18.193
Also. we're terrible cooks.

977
01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:25.408
The cereal-to-milk ratio in this bowl
of Cinnamon Toast Crunch

978
01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:26.576
is perfection.

979
01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.037
Why. thank you. kind sir.

980
01:02:30.038 --> 01:02:31.039
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

981
01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:35.627
You know...

982
01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:38.004
I would learn to cook for you.

983
01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:53.937
How did he die?

984
01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:56.690
Um...

985
01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.734
It was a drunk driver.

986
01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:02.904
In broad daylight.

987
01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:07.993
It's been two years.

988
01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:10.453
And I still can't believe it.

989
01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:15.291
- I'm sorry. I'm just...
- No. no.

990
01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:19.629
You can't really prepare
for something like that. can you?

991
01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:23.842
I was so sure we'd grow old together.

992
01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:28.555
And now I'm the only one growing older.

993
01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:30.890
He's exactly the same.

994
01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.352
Same eyes...

995
01:03:35.395 --> 01:03:39.482
same voice. same smile.

996
01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:43.403
Exactly how I remember it.

997
01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:47.782
I'm the only one who's changing.

998
01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:52.912
All right. enough about me.

999
01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:57.917
Tell me. um... tell me more about you.

1000
01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.294
What else do you like?

1001
01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:01.504
Besides music.

1002
01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:04.716
Oh. um... Well. that's easy.

1003
01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:07.302
I love basketball.

1004
01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:09.137
We should play some time.

1005
01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:11.347
- I'd like that.
- Mm-hm.

1006
01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:15.226
But. uh. are you any good?

1007
01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:19.397
Well. you're just gonna have
to find out. now. mister.

1008
01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:24.819
I really like your voice.

1009
01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.991
Tell me more
about why you like basketball.

1010
01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:32.744
I feel like you can learn more

1011
01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:35.246
by playing ten minutes of basketball
with someone

1012
01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:38.416
than you can talking to them
for a whole hour.

1013
01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:40.794
How they work with other people.

1014
01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.253
Face opposition.

1015
01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:45.632
And not to sound too grandiose
or anything...

1016
01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:49.928
but kind of feel
the game represents life itself.

1017
01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:53.098
All these people
are from different places...

1018
01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:56.226
gathered to play the same game.

1019
01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.230
Different cultures. races.

1020
01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:02.315
It doesn't matter where you're from.

1021
01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:05.652
Yeah.

1022
01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:13.284
Yeah. it's what makes this country.
this city. so...

1023
01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:22.544
So beautiful.

1024
01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:12.093
Well...

1025
01:06:12.177 --> 01:06:15.138
<i>♪ I'm on another level
I'm a rebel... ♪</i>

1026
01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:16.973
Uh...

1027
01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:17.891
Hey.

1028
01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.393
<i>♪ I'm a rebel
I'm on another level... ♪</i>

1029
01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:21.477
Hey.

1030
01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:27.400
Hello?

1031
01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:39.078
Don't be scared.
I'm a friend of your sister's.

1032
01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:41.623
- She's asleep. I didn't know what to do.
- What?

1033
01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:44.918
Oh. my God. you're. uh... You're...

1034
01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:48.171
- You're Rob the opera guy.
- Yeah.

1035
01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:50.924
- I'm Rob the opera guy. Hey.
- Oh!

1036
01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.218
- You must be Suzy.
- Yeah.

1037
01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:54.594
So she fell asleep?

1038
01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:56.179
- Yeah.
- And you...

1039
01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:59.390
decided to stay on the couch?

1040
01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:02.101
Oh. I just wanted
to make sure she was okay.

1041
01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:03.353
Yeah.

1042
01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.939
Oh. I'm sorry about cutting off
your airways there.

1043
01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:06.981
No. it's fine.

1044
01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:08.566
Do you want a beer?

1045
01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:09.817
Okay.

1046
01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:11.236
What do you...?

1047
01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:15.281
I will see your...
And I will raise you some Indian...

1048
01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:20.453
What? No! Like. have you ever gone
to a live One Direction concert?

1049
01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:21.913
Yeah. Yeah. I...

1050
01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:32.465
He basically made
his entire first album on his iPhone.

1051
01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:33.508
That is awesome.

1052
01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:35.051
Hey!

1053
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.720
- Hey!
- Oh. Hey.

1054
01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:40.348
Look! Rolls. coffee. Coffee. rolls.

1055
01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:42.976
Rob bought you rolls and coffee.

1056
01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:44.936
So nice.

1057
01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.234
I have to go to Soul Cycle.

1058
01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:53.611
It's this thing I do on Sunday.

1059
01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:55.280
- I just can't. you know...
- Oh.

1060
01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:57.198
Uh. yeah. I better go too.

1061
01:07:57.282 --> 01:07:58.366
No. don't!

1062
01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:01.202
You should totally stay
and finish your breakfast.

1063
01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:02.161
Have coffee.

1064
01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:06.040
Um... I'll see you later.

1065
01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.377
Just text me. I'll text you. Okay.

1066
01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:17.510
Soul Cycle is a cult.

1067
01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:48.416
Testing one. <i>un. deux.</i> Check.

01:09:26.954 --> 01:09:28.081
Nothing. I. uh...

1078
01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:33.878
- What do you mean?
- You look brighter.

1079
01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:35.755
Like. more in focus.

1080
01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:38.299
You're standing even straighter too.

1081
01:09:39.217 --> 01:09:40.885
You've talked to the unknown texter?

1082
01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:45.056
Well. uh. she's not unknown anymore.

1083
01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.601
Come on. let's have a little chat.

1084
01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:51.229
The more I get to know her.
the better I like her.

1085
01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:55.024
But she's still completely stuck
on her former boyfriend.

1086
01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:58.027
And he's dead.

1087
01:09:58.111 --> 01:09:59.362
This is a big problem.

1088
01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:03.282
What is her name?

1089
01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:04.909
Mira.

1090
01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:08.996
Mira Ray.

1091
01:10:09.664 --> 01:10:12.708
The Mira Ray who writes
the caterpillar books?

1092
01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:14.627
You've read them?

1093
01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:18.464
I have three children.
of course I read them. They're amazing.

1094
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.675
What do you think of this?

1095
01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:23.136
Okay. are you serious?

1096
01:10:23.845 --> 01:10:25.805
I hate it. What am I doing?

1097
01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:27.598
It looks like I'm standing in hell.

1098
01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:31.519
Listen. the concept needs
to be bigger. brighter.

1099
01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:33.062
More joyful.

1100
01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:34.147
Yeah?

1101
01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:46.909
Céline. this may be too much to ask.
but I have an idea.

1102
01:10:58.754 --> 01:10:59.839
Hello.

1103
01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:01.382
<i>Mira Ray?
</i>- Mm-hm.

1104
01:11:01.466 --> 01:11:03.468
<i>Hi. this is Céline Dion.</i>

1105
01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:06.721
Sure. And I'm Mariah Carey.

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:17.273

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:19.859
Um...

1111
01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.444
Oh. my gosh. Hi.

1112
01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:23.112
It's really you.

1113
01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:25.990
<i>Uh. how did you get my number?</i>

1114
01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:28.576
I have my people who have people.

1115
01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:30.536
Um...

1116
01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.330
What can I do for you?

1117
01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:35.958
Well. I happen to be a big fan.

1118
01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:37.877
Of me?

1119
01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.048
<i>Of your stubborn caterpillar books.</i>

1120
01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:44.550
Oh. my gosh. Really?

1121
01:11:46.677 --> 01:11:49.514
I'm so honored. Uh. thank you so much.

1122
01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:51.015
Are you free?

1123
01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:54.894
I've always wanted to meet
the creator of the Bhoomi books.

1124
01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:57.396
<i>I love them so much.</i>

1125
01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:04.904
I really like your presence.

1126
01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:10.117
Oh. wow. I really like your presence too.

1127
01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:12.662
I mean. you have the presence. so...

1128
01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:16.541
It's been quite a long time
since the last Bhoomi book.

1129
01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:19.418
Yes. I have been...

1130
01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:21.671
How would you like to design
my tour poster?

1131
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:23.756
Are you serious?

1132
01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:27.301
Is there anything in my expression
that conveys a lack of seriousness?

1133
01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:31.597
It's just such an honor
that you would even consider me.

1134
01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.099
I want something great.

1135
01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:37.019
And I know you can do it.

1136
01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:43.693
I would need to see some ideas
at the end of this week.

1137
01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.695
Yes. Of course.

1138
01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:46.779
That's great.

1139
01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:48.489
Ciao.

1140
01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:54.787
Oh.

1141
01:12:55.663 --> 01:12:56.747
Yes.

1142
01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:04.255
Hey.

1143
01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:06.007
What are you doing right now?

1144
01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:09.885
The Céline Dion calls me randomly

1145
01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:12.763
and says.
"I want you to design my tour poster."

1146
01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:15.266
I just met her. That's just... What?

1147
01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:18.936
You open yourself up to the universe
and it'll come rushing in.

1148
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.980
Yeah. but this is crazy.

1149
01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:23.149
Well. it's crazy. Yeah.

1150
01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.984
Okay. Look...

1151
01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.486
I'm really sorry about ghosting you
the other day.

1152
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.488
No. No. it's...

1153
01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:31.449
Here's me apologizing. okay?

1154
01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:33.326
Here you go.

1155
01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.994
Huh. What's this?

1156
01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:38.164
It's champagne. in a can.
'cause we're classy.

1157
01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.540
What are we celebrating?

1158
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:42.710
Change.

1159
01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.588
Also...

1160
01:13:46.297 --> 01:13:48.633
I thought this might be a good time...

1161
01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:53.387
to figure out what type of person you are.

1162
01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:55.139
- Yep.
- Okay.

1163
01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:57.141
- You ready to tell me...
- I see.

1164
01:13:57.224 --> 01:13:58.267
...everything about you?

1165
01:13:58.351 --> 01:13:59.477
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1166
01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.354
- Let's go.
- This way.

1167
01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:03.773
- Huh? Oh. Oh!
- Whoo!

1168
01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:07.318
No fair. you conned me.

1169
01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:09.612
Well. you're not the only Knicks fan
on this court.

1170
01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:10.863
Huh.

1171
01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:12.406
Okay.

1172
01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:14.408
What?

1173
01:14:15.493 --> 01:14:17.411
- What. you're gonna give me this shot?
- Sure.

1174
01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:18.746
- You're rusty.
- Uh-huh.

1175
01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:20.039
- Go for it.
- Okay.

1176
01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:24.543
- Whoa!
- Look at that. Confident.

1177
01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:25.961
I like it. I like it.

1178
01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:27.296
- Game point.
- Okay.

1179
01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:29.131
Ready to lose?

1180
01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:30.216
Never.

1181
01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:33.469
- Care to make it interesting?
- What do you have in mind?

1182
01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:36.347
- Well. if I win...
- Uh-huh?

1183
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:37.807
we go back to your place.

1184
01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:38.891
Uh-huh?

1185
01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.685
And I get to have my way with you.

1186
01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:41.894
Huh.

1187
01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:43.145
And if I win?

1188
01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.023
I could cook for you again.

1189
01:15:14.468 --> 01:15:15.636
Good morning.

1190
01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:19.390
Good morning.

1191
01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:28.566
Hm.

1192
01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:31.610
Shit.

1193
01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:32.695
What?

1194
01:15:34.488 --> 01:15:37.450
I have to be in the newsroom
in 15 minutes.

1195
01:15:39.243 --> 01:15:40.911
- Seriously?
- Mm-hm.

1196
01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:44.999
No.

1197
01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.131
Sorry.

1198
01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:57.428
Okay.

1199
01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:58.804
I better get ready.

1200
01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:01.223

I know I should have told you.
I wanted to tell you.

I tried to tell you. but...

1217
01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:13.814
Like. I didn't know how.
The circumstances were so incredible.

1218
01:18:13.898 --> 01:18:15.983

1219
01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:19.153

'Cause you're a creep
or just some asshole?

1222
01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:27.494
Neither. Those are both terrible choices.

1223
01:18:27.578 --> 01:18:31.040
But I was afraid you'd stop talking to me
if you knew the truth. But. Mira...

1224
01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:34.752
- Mira. my feelings for you are so real.
- You took John away from me.

1225
01:18:36.003 --> 01:18:38.505
I didn't take him away from you.
He's gone.

1226
01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:43.761
John is gone.

1227
01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:51.685
I'm so sorry.
I didn't want you to find out like this.

1228
01:18:51.769 --> 01:18:54.396
- I wanted to tell you before...
- Before what?

1229
01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:57.274
Before you slept with me?

1230
01:19:01.195 --> 01:19:03.906
If you have any decency.
you'll erase my number

1231
01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:05.240
and never call me again.

1232
01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:06.450
- Mira. I...
- Goodbye. Rob.

1233
01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:08.994
Have a good life.

Looks like Mo has found himself a lady.

1251
01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:35.873
Hey.

1252
01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:38.834
- Mo.
- Hey.

1253
01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:42.880
Who's your friend?

1254
01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:45.549
That's Jane. I've known her a long time.

1255
01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:47.092
- Long time?
- Two days.

1256
01:20:48.552 --> 01:20:51.430
- Oh. my God. Are you dating?
- Mira inspired me.

1257
01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:54.933
- What did I do?
- I saw you with that Rob guy...

1258
01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:56.894
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
- No. no. No. listen.

1259
01:20:56.977 --> 01:20:59.772
And when the last person left
the other night. I sat down.

1260
01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:03.150
I poured Roxy and me two shots.

1261
01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:05.694
I drank them both. as I always do.

1262
01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:08.280
Then I lit a candle. and I said to Roxy.

1263
01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:10.574
"I will always be your husband.

1264
01:21:10.657 --> 01:21:13.911
But what I'm really missing.
like in my core.

1265
01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:15.788
is sharing a joke with someone

1266
01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:17.664
when I'm feeling down in the mouth."

1267
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:20.834
And dead people. not so funny.

1268
01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:23.295
So. um...

1269
01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:25.756
Thank you.

1270
01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.181
What can we do?

1271
01:21:34.264 --> 01:21:35.099
Huh?

1272
01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:36.767
Oh. nothing.

1273
01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:39.394
Nothing. Rob ruined it.

1274
01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:42.773
What was I supposed to do?

1275
01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:45.484
You should have said something
to her right away.

1276
01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.111
What should I have said?

1277
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.280
"Excuse me. I'd like to get to know you.

1278
01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:54.368
but I keep getting these text messages
you write your dead boyfriend.

1279
01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:56.411
I would have said something earlier.

1280
01:21:56.495 --> 01:21:58.455
but I didn't wanna take away
the possibility

1281
01:21:58.539 --> 01:22:00.124
for you to stay in contact with him.

1282
01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:02.668
I know this is the weirdest way
to get to know someone.

1283
01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:04.711
and I understand
if you just wanna walk away.

1284
01:22:04.795 --> 01:22:06.797
But I didn't wanna start off
by telling you a lie."

1285
01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:08.507
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Mm-hm.

1286
01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:10.509
Shit.

1287
01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.594
It might have actually worked.

1288
01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:14.972
So. what now?

1289
01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:16.723
I don't know.

1290
01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:22.229
I can't call her.
And there's no way for me to reach her.

1291
01:22:23.313 --> 01:22:25.983
That sucks.

1292
01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:41.165
What time's deadline?

1293
01:22:41.748 --> 01:22:42.624
Why?

1294
01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:44.793
I don't like that look in your eyes. Rob!

1295
01:22:45.419 --> 01:22:47.629
Oh. boy. This is very stressful.

1296
01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:49.173
Where are you going? Rob?

1297
01:22:49.256 --> 01:22:51.967
- Can you just calm down?
- Rob!

1298
01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:08.817
Holy shit.

1299
01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:10.986
What?

1300
01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:13.739
Bernard just sent me this
and asked me if I'd seen it.

1301
01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:22.456
I don't need to read that.

1302
01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:32.466
"Texts for Mira...

1303
01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.177
- by Rob Burns."
- Stop.

1304
01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:39.348
"This was actually supposed to be
a profile on Céline Dion

1305
01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:41.308
as she continues
on her first American tour

1306
01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:44.061
in over ten years
at the Barclays Center this weekend.

1307
01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:47.439
My assignment was to get her to open up.
reveal who she really is.

1308
01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:49.399
Unfortunately. I did not succeed.

1309
01:23:49.483 --> 01:23:52.110
Instead. Miss Dion opened me.

1310
01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:56.907
When she told me I wasn't capable
of hearing her music. I scoffed.

1311
01:23:56.990 --> 01:24:00.744
What was there to hear? A bunch of
sentimental platitudes on life and love?

1312
01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:03.413
I had no room for such nonsense
in my life because..."

1313
01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:05.165
<i>...because I knew love was a myth.</i>

1314
01:24:05.249 --> 01:24:07.376
<i>A shared delusion between two people</i>

1315
01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:09.670
<i>that could end as soon
as someone changed their mind.</i>

1316
01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:11.255
<i>Then I got your texts.</i>

1317
01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:14.758
<i>Slowly. I began
to realize Céline was right.</i>

1318
01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:17.552
<i>I couldn't hear the music.
'Cause my heart had given up on love.</i>

1319
01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:20.847
<i>I know you didn't mean to text me
your innermost thoughts and feelings.</i>

1320
01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:21.765
<i>but you did.</i>

1321
01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:24.559
<i>And I made a big mistake
by not telling you that right away.</i>

1322
01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.853
<i>And I do not deserve a second chance.</i>

1323
01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:29.690
<i>But thanks to you.
I can hear the music again.</i>

1324
01:24:29.773 --> 01:24:32.484
<i>I hear it in the sound of your voice
when you call my name.</i>

1325
01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:35.862
<i>Your laughter after asking me
ridiculous "Would you rather" questions.</i>

1326
01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:39.157
<i>And that slow. gentle breath you take
just before falling asleep.</i>

1327
01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:41.118
<i>I know love is real</i>

1328
01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:42.828
<i>'cause I've fallen in love with you.</i>

1329
01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:44.871
<i>And if you can find it in your heart
to forgive me.</i>

1330
01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:47.624
<i>I promise I'll do everything I can
to earn your trust back.</i>

1331
01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:49.668
<i>'Cause a new day has come for me. Mira.</i>

1332
01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.586
<i>Where it was dark. now it's light.</i>

1333
01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.506
<i>Where there was pain. now there's joy.</i>

1334
01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:57.801
<i>Where there was weakness.
I found my strength.</i>

1335
01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:01.346
And I'm not afraid to tell the world...

1336
01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:04.766
I've been touched by an angel with love.

1337
01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:09.521
<i>Meet me tonight at the place
where I learned to hear the music again.</i>

1338
01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:12.899
"Please give this another chance.

1339
01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:15.569
Please give me another chance."

1340
01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:29.791
Seriously? She listening?

1341
01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:31.668
Céline Dion.

1342
01:25:32.252 --> 01:25:34.838
What even is your life right now?

1343
01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:37.132
Just...

1344
01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:41.178
- Hello?
- <i>First off.</i>

1345
01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:44.389
I want you to know
that Rob didn't put me up to this.

1346
01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:48.894
- Sure.
- You know I lost my husband. yes?

1347
01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:51.146
<i>He was the first and only love of my life.</i>

1348
01:25:51.688 --> 01:25:53.273
I'm so sorry.

1349
01:25:53.357 --> 01:25:56.735
René may have lied to me once
before we were married.

1350
01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:57.736
He did?

1351
01:25:58.278 --> 01:25:59.363
<i>Yeah.</i>

1352
01:25:59.446 --> 01:26:00.739
<i>About Seal.</i>

1353
01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:01.698
The animal--

1354
01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:03.909
The singer. Seal. Of course.

1355
01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.452
It was 1991.

1356
01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:08.747
and Seal. the singer.

1357
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:10.540
had just released his first album.

1358
01:26:10.624 --> 01:26:13.377
<i>I wanted to sing a duet with him so badly.</i>

1359
01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.796
<i>but René told me he wasn't too interested.</i>

1360
01:26:15.879 --> 01:26:17.297
Turns out René was jealous.

1361
01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:19.591
He didn't want me around Seal at all.

1362
01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:21.676
Were you mad when he lied?

1363
01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.178
<i>Of course I was mad.</i>

1364
01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:25.555
But we worked through it.

1365
01:26:25.639 --> 01:26:28.350
Because that's what you do
when you're in love.

1366
01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:30.227
<i>You work through things.</i>

1367
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:32.896
<i>Also. René agreed
to do the dishes for life</i>

1368
01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:34.439
<i>in return for my forgiveness.</i>

1369
01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:36.608
- You guys did your own dishes?
<i>- No.</i>

1370
01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:40.320
We don't do a lot of dishes.
But you get the point?

1371
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:47.327
I'm just a bit confused.

1372
01:26:47.411 --> 01:26:48.286
<i>Look. Mira.</i>

1373
01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:50.997
I don't really care
whether you and Rob get together.

1374
01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:52.582
You don't?

1375
01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:56.753
No. My only concern is you.

1376
01:26:58.505 --> 01:26:59.339
<i>Now...</i>

1377
01:26:59.923 --> 01:27:01.425
how's my poster coming along?

1378
01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:03.969
I'm working on it.

1379
01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:07.180
Have you lost your mind?

1380
01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:08.598
This is a newspaper.

1381
01:27:08.682 --> 01:27:11.977
Not some sort of dating service.

1382
01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.229
What am I supposed
to tell our publishers. eh?

1383
01:27:14.855 --> 01:27:16.356
What are they gonna say?

1384
01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.150
They are serious people.

1385
01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:23.071
You have put the entire
newspaper's reputation at risk!

1386
01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:30.871
Rob. this is the most
unprofessional behavior

1387
01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:35.167
I have ever seen in my life!

1388
01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:37.544
No!

1389
01:27:37.627 --> 01:27:40.380
You total dickhead!

1390
01:27:40.464 --> 01:27:42.549
I have to make them think
I'm ripping you to shreds.

1391
01:27:42.632 --> 01:27:45.594
Or else they'll all try and publish
stories about their personal lives.

1392
01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:48.472
I can't bear you!

1393
01:27:48.555 --> 01:27:51.475
- You think you could slip something by me?
- I'm sorry?

1394
01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:53.560
What? Don't answer me back!

1395
01:27:53.643 --> 01:27:55.979
- Well done. It was quite a moving piece.
- Thank you.

1396
01:27:56.062 --> 01:28:00.692
It's great for you 'cause. uh. well.
I've decided you can do your podcast.

1397
01:28:02.736 --> 01:28:04.237
What? Seriously?

1398
01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:06.865
That's amazing.

1399
01:28:07.657 --> 01:28:10.410
Well. you gotta win her back now.

1400
01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:12.162
Make for a hell of a follow-up piece.

1401
01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:14.164
You've got your heart back. Rob.

1402
01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:15.248
Well done.

1403
01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:17.334
Thank you. boss.

1404
01:28:18.418 --> 01:28:19.920
- Now get out!
- Yeah.

01:28:35.685 --> 01:28:36.978
What would you have sent?

1408
01:28:38.063 --> 01:28:39.064

you're supposed
to just keep living your life.

No. I don't know where she is.
and she's not answering her phone either.

1432
01:30:48.318 --> 01:30:49.319
Okay.

1433
01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.112
Uh. wait.

1434
01:30:51.821 --> 01:30:53.657
You should come in
and take a look at something.

1435
01:31:07.796 --> 01:31:09.381
- It's beautiful.
- Mm-hm.

1436
01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:21.768
It looks like she's finally moving on.

1437
01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:25.230
And I'm happy for her.

1438
01:31:27.107 --> 01:31:28.483
I'm sorry. dude.

1439
01:31:31.444 --> 01:31:35.907
Sometimes people just aren't
in the same place. you know?

1440
01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:37.492
Yeah.

1441
01:31:51.673 --> 01:31:53.341
- Wait. that's it.
- Hm?

1442
01:31:54.467 --> 01:31:55.301
Suzy. that--

1443
01:31:55.385 --> 01:31:57.011
- That's-- Whoa! Why?
- Thank you.

1444
01:31:57.095 --> 01:31:59.180
Yeah. sure. Anytime. Glad I could--

1445
01:31:59.889 --> 01:32:02.225
Uh. okay. Catch up with you later.

1446
01:32:08.732 --> 01:32:09.733
Thank you.

1447
01:32:37.969 --> 01:32:38.970
Mira!

1448
01:33:13.296 --> 01:33:14.297
Mira!

1449
01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:30.563
I was starting to wonder
if you changed your mind.

1450
01:33:31.147 --> 01:33:34.442
- I'm sorry. I was in the park.
- Yeah. I figured.

1451
01:33:35.777 --> 01:33:38.822
Also. Suzy sent me
about a thousand texts

1452
01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:39.906
telling me that.

1453
01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:43.284
I have a few conditions. Rob.

1454
01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:46.496
Of course.

1455
01:33:47.121 --> 01:33:51.543
First of all. no more lying. Never.

1456
01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:54.838
I won't. Ever. ever. ever again.

1457
01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:58.174
I need the full truth from you
at all times.

1458
01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:00.844
Even if it's messy. Even if it's painful.

1459
01:34:01.719 --> 01:34:04.097
Especially if it's messy and painful.

1460
01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:07.642
'Cause that's life. you know?

1461
01:34:07.725 --> 01:34:09.811
And if we can't get through it together.

1462
01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:12.689
then what's the point. right?

1463
01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:14.899
Right.

1464
01:34:16.234 --> 01:34:17.694
I'll always love John.

1465
01:34:18.236 --> 01:34:19.237
I know.

1466
01:34:22.699 --> 01:34:24.117
I'll always miss John.

1467
01:34:26.369 --> 01:34:27.370
I know.

1468
01:34:30.206 --> 01:34:33.668
And I don't know
how this grief will change over time...

1469
01:34:34.627 --> 01:34:37.046
but it's always going to be a part of me.

1470
01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:43.303
I understand.

1471
01:34:45.889 --> 01:34:47.056
You understand.

1472
01:34:48.683 --> 01:34:49.684
I know.

1473
01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:53.396
And I appreciate it so much.

1474
01:34:55.064 --> 01:34:56.065
Anything else?

1475
01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:02.322
Well. you're gonna have to learn
how to cook 'cause I can't.

1476
01:35:03.156 --> 01:35:04.741
I'll sign up for lessons right away.

1477
01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:08.369
And Céline said you need to do the dishes.

1478
01:35:08.453 --> 01:35:09.829
Of course.

1479
01:35:09.913 --> 01:35:11.748

1480
01:35:11.831 --> 01:35:12.832

Hello. and welcome
to our new podcast. <i>Would You Rather.</i>

1533
01:39:51.444 --> 01:39:53.571
with me. your host. Rob Burns.

1534
01:39:53.654 --> 01:39:56.199
Where we get
into all that really weird stuff

1535
01:39:56.282 --> 01:39:58.326
with our favorite musicians.

1536
01:39:58.409 --> 01:40:01.954
So without further ado.
I'd like to welcome our first guest.

1537
01:40:02.038 --> 01:40:04.415
She is an uber-talented.

1538
01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:08.669
multifaceted singer-songwriter
extraordinaire.

1539
01:40:08.753 --> 01:40:11.547
philosopher. matchmaker.

1540
01:40:11.631 --> 01:40:12.882
the list could go on.

1541
01:40:12.965 --> 01:40:17.470
Please put your hands together
and welcome none other than

1542
01:40:17.553 --> 01:40:19.639
Miss Céline Dion!

1543
01:40:19.722 --> 01:40:22.808
Oh. thank you. thank you. thank you.

1544
01:40:22.892 --> 01:40:24.352
Céline. welcome to the show.

1545
01:40:24.435 --> 01:40:26.771
And before we move on
to the really good stuff.

1546
01:40:26.854 --> 01:40:29.232
- I have a very burning question for you.
- Ooh.

1547
01:40:29.315 --> 01:40:31.776
Would you rather own ten cats

1548
01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:34.946
or a parrot that sits on your head
for 22 hours a day?

1549
01:40:35.029 --> 01:40:36.906
Oh! Uh...

1550
01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:38.824
I'd go for the parrot.

1551
01:40:40.034 --> 01:40:41.619
- Right answer.
- Yes!

1552
01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:44.705
Céline. we're here to talk about
your new tour.

1553
01:40:44.789 --> 01:40:47.208
- The new album. The new everything.
- Yes.

1554
01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:48.793
