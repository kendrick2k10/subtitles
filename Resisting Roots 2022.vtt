3
00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:36.782
Not happening. Ro.

4
00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:38.033
Sis. please.

5
00:01:38.057 --> 00:01:39.660
I said no. and I meant it.

6
00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:42.495
Seriously?
I'm 16. not five.

7
00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.205
I don't know these kids.

8
00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.582
And I need you to take Mary
to dance class on Friday.

9
00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.334
I've got two clients
for a color and cut.

10
00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.879
Yeah. you always have clients.

11
00:01:50.903 --> 00:01:53.048
How do you think I pay
for your baseball equipment?

12
00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:54.717
Okay. do you think money
grows on trees?

13
00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:56.259
That's fine. I'll just be
the laughing stock

14
00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:57.326
of all the juniors.

15
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.932
Look.
I'm sorry. Ro.

16
00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:03.726
We need the money.

17
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.477
I'm two years behind
on property taxes.

18
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.355
The bills keep coming in.

19
00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.299
Maybe we should start thinking
about selling Dad's Mustang.

20
00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.529
It would solve
a lot of problems.

21
00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:18.489
We're not selling Dad's car.
all right?

22
00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:19.908
I won't go to the stupid party.

23
00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:21.617
It's no biggie. really.

24
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.747
It's not stupid to want
to hang out with your friends.

25
00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:26.749
Hey. maybe I can move
my appointments?

26
00:02:26.773 --> 00:02:28.876
No. I mean. I've already started
looking at other jobs. so...

27
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.627
Your job is to keep
a grade-A average

28
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.213
and to get into a good college
on scholarship.

29
00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:37.009
You can't keep working
yourself to the bone.

30
00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:39.594
I'm fine.

31
00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:41.304
We've been going
strong for three years now.

32
00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:43.098
Why change it?

33
00:02:43.122 --> 00:02:45.433
Maybe it's because you haven't
been with a friend

34
00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:47.811
or on a date since...

35
00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:50.898
I can't even remember the last
time I've seen you with a guy.

36
00:02:50.922 --> 00:02:52.941
I see guys all the time.

37
00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:55.425
Yeah. your yoga class?
It doesn't count.

38
00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:58.706
Take care of yourself out there.

39
00:02:59.722 --> 00:03:01.075
You can count on it.

40
00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.658
- Bye.
- Oh. wait. wait.

41
00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.185
Mary. come here.
Your shirt's on backwards.

42
00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.580
Arms up.

43
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.540
Good morning. San Francisco.

44
00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:12.878
Let's talk baseball.
specifically Trent Fox.

45
00:03:12.902 --> 00:03:15.338
It's been a few weeks since
the bad boy hitter

46
00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.381
from the Ports
tore his hamstring

47
00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:19.134
in the last game of the season.

48
00:03:19.158 --> 00:03:21.302
The injury doesn't
seem to have stopped him.

49
00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:22.805
Brian?

50
00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:23.806
Well. Gerry.
there are those who say

51
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.515
Trent Fox hasn't peaked.

52
00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:33.439
Wake up. you piece of shit.

53
00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.506
Ross?

54
00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:37.903
What are you doing here?

55
00:03:37.927 --> 00:03:39.612
Six weeks of
recuperation. Trent.

56
00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.115
and this is what you have
to show for it?

57
00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.407
You living in filth. man.

58
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:44.118
Drinking? Smoking?

59
00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:45.618
Have you even gone
to therapy yet?

60
00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:46.995
Ross. of course I have.

61
00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.579
Three days a week.

62
00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:50.665
Three other days
I lift weights with Clay.

63
00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.002
Are you supposed
to be lifting weights. Huh?

64
00:03:54.026 --> 00:03:56.839
What about strengthening.
flexibility. stretching?

65
00:03:56.863 --> 00:03:59.424
Doc recommended daily
yoga classes for you. Trent.

66
00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:04.179
You have got to
snap out of it. kid.

67
00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:05.889
I mean. is this what
you do with your time?

68
00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:07.515
Hell. I'm surprised
you have one of your little

69
00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.792
girlfriends up in here warming
your bed right now.

70
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:14.172
Really?

71
00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:16.274
Maybe.

72
00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:19.485
Shit.
Unbelievable.

73
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.489
It's always the talented
ones. too.

74
00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:26.409
Pills. liquor

75
00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:29.103
and endless fucking women.

76
00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:31.790
What else. Trent?

77
00:04:31.814 --> 00:04:34.584
What the hell else?
Huh?

78
00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:37.004
I don't owe you
any explanations.

79
00:04:37.028 --> 00:04:38.629
I'm on medical leave.

80
00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:40.215
The hell you don't!

81
00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:42.258
The way I see it.
you got one of two choices.

82
00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:45.929
Either get your shit together
or lose your contract.

83
00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:47.680
And with the way
that you've been hitting.

84
00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:51.291
you're looking at an offer
of 100 mil for five years.

85
00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:55.480
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:57.941
Jesus.

87
00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:00.861
Look. man.

88
00:05:00.885 --> 00:05:03.529
Coach wants you ready
by spring training.

89
00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.866
I'll lay off the booze
and the late nights.

90
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.410
And you'll go to the therapy
and the yoga.

91
00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.872
Yoga? Come on.

92
00:05:11.896 --> 00:05:14.166
Trent. you will go to a class
or I swear by everything holy.

93
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.251
I will drag you there
my damn self.

94
00:05:16.275 --> 00:05:18.544
Fine. I'll go.

95
00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.713
When?

96
00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.090
Tomorrow.

97
00:05:22.114 --> 00:05:23.842
I'll go tomorrow.

98
00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:25.010
Promise?

99
00:05:25.034 --> 00:05:26.326
A man of my word.

100
00:05:29.956 --> 00:05:30.957
Prove it.

101
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.668
♪♪

102
00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:47.573
Hi. Audrey.
So good to see you.

103
00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:48.891
Oh. hi.

104
00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:06.676
Um... feel free to
get into a child's pose

105
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.940
and begin your deep breathing.

106
00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:17.020
Hi. I'm Genevieve or Viv.

107
00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:19.189
Is this your first class?

108
00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:20.899
Trent Fox.

109
00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:24.027
I'm here for rehabilitation.

110
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:26.487
Pulled hamstring. right?

111
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:28.447
Torn.

112
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.117
How did you know that?

113
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:33.954
My brother is a huge Ports fan.

114
00:06:33.978 --> 00:06:37.790
I can't believe you're here.
Rowan is going to flip.

115
00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:38.833
Who's Rowan?

116
00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:41.110
My brother. the Ports fan.

117
00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:47.217
Anyway. I have an extended
mat for you here

118
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:49.970
because you're so hard.

119
00:06:49.994 --> 00:06:52.288
I mean big.

120
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.351
Tall.

121
00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:57.751
You're tall.

122
00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.254
Okay.

123
00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:05.735
Follow along as best as you can
and back off if anything puts

124
00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.654
too much pressure
on the hamstring.

125
00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.033
And we can talk after class.
if you like.

126
00:07:11.057 --> 00:07:14.619
I think I'd like that
very much. Gumdrop.

127
00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:16.495
Gumdrop?

128
00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.873
Your lips are pretty in pink.

129
00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:21.691
Reminds me of a sugar coated
cherry gumdrop.

130
00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:25.904
Oh.

131
00:07:27.365 --> 00:07:28.466
Hello. class.

132
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.969
Please sit on your bottoms.

133
00:07:30.993 --> 00:07:34.722
Press your seat into the mats.

134
00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.539
Bring your hands
to heart center.

135
00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:41.271
Let's close our eyes and begin

136
00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:44.690
by setting our intentions
for today's yoga class.

137
00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:47.343
What is it that you want
out of today's practice?

138
00:08:05.069 --> 00:08:06.070
Come up.

139
00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.701
Breathing as you rise.

140
00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:18.891
Warrior Two.

141
00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.726
Arms straight.

142
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.336
Look at the wall.

143
00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:28.818
Windmill your arms
into downward dog.

144
00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.570
Feet shoulder-width apart.

145
00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:33.847
There you go.

146
00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:39.186
Just going to grab your hips.

147
00:08:41.105 --> 00:08:42.665
Oh...

148
00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:44.066
That feels like heaven.

149
00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:49.696
Got a long way to go.
but we'll get you there.

150
00:08:58.247 --> 00:09:00.582
The light in me bows
to the light in you.

151
00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:04.961
Thank you. everyone.

152
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.789
That was fine.

153
00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.899
Could we do that again.
privately?

154
00:09:27.193 --> 00:09:28.836
Private classes?

155
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.339
Whenever you're available.
I'm down.

156
00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:34.592
Oh. well. if you can pay.
I'm available after this class

157
00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:35.968
every weekday.

158
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:38.180
There's a room
open from 10:30 to noon.

159
00:09:38.204 --> 00:09:39.264
Which day would you like?

160
00:09:39.288 --> 00:09:40.598
All of them.

161
00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.016
Could you be more specific?

162
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.977
I would like all of your
time from 10:30 to noon.

163
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:48.856
every day of the week
until the end of the month.

164
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.858
Every weekday?

165
00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:53.694
Doc says I need to do yoga
five times a week.

166
00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:56.095
For once. I'm
feeling cooperative.

167
00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.521
Did that fine man hit on you?

168
00:10:05.523 --> 00:10:06.606
Kind of.

169
00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.252
Well. he's beautiful.

170
00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:10.777
And you've been alone
far too long.

171
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.340
Oh. really?

172
00:10:13.364 --> 00:10:15.591
Oh. don't you have a
class to teach. Luna?

173
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.451
Don't you have a
man to hunt down?

174
00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.013
Actually. I don't have
to hunt him down

175
00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:22.349
because we have private lessons

176
00:10:22.373 --> 00:10:25.017
every weekday
for the next month.

177
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.812
He wants you!

178
00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:29.897
To help him recuperate.

179
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.174
Oh. Mm-Hmm.
Yeah. sure.

180
00:10:34.343 --> 00:10:36.070
Bye. silly.

181
00:10:39.557 --> 00:10:41.159

I can hear you
thinking over there.

362
00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:33.643
What's got you so twisted up.
Vivy?

363
00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:38.965
I am so sorry for bothering you
in whatever it is...

364
00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:41.944
That you are doing.

365
00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:45.655
You're putting off
some tumultuous vibes.

366
00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:49.142
How do you expect
to teach a class like this? Sit.

367
00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:57.667
So why are you
sitting on a desk?

368
00:21:57.691 --> 00:21:59.212
Getting perspective.

369
00:21:59.236 --> 00:22:02.089
You know. accounting
is not my strong suit.

370
00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:05.200
And you have to sit on
a desk to get perspective?

371
00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:08.930
To fully understand the problem.

372
00:22:08.954 --> 00:22:12.016
it is best to give
all of yourself.

373
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.143
So I inserted myself
into the chaos

374
00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:18.480
in the hopes that I find
a fix to my numbers issue.

375
00:22:18.504 --> 00:22:19.857
And did you get an answer?

376
00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:23.152
I did.
To ward off negativity.

377
00:22:23.176 --> 00:22:24.760
It's beautiful.

378
00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:33.561
What was the answer.
if you don't mind me asking?

379
00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:37.499
To hire an accountant.

380
00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:40.902
In the end. I realized I was
not needed in the equation.

381
00:22:41.987 --> 00:22:43.630
Is the center doing okay?

382
00:22:43.654 --> 00:22:45.549
Better than ever.

383
00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:46.926
Speaking of...

384
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.535

private lesson all week.

Oh. whatever's going on
in that head of yours

386
00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:57.144
is torturous to watch.

387
00:22:57.168 --> 00:22:59.296
Please share with me.

388
00:23:00.754 --> 00:23:02.691
Your mama's not here.

389
00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:05.694
God bless her beautiful
young soul.

390
00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:07.345
You've got to work
with what you have.

391
00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:12.326
Okay.

392
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:16.454
My private client is
professional baseball player

393
00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:18.540
Trent Fox.

394
00:23:18.564 --> 00:23:21.127
And yesterday
I kissed him right here.

395
00:23:21.151 --> 00:23:23.878
I mean. not right
here in Studio B.

396
00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:27.091
but now he wants to date me.

397
00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:30.743
and I'm going to
introduce him to Row. and...

398
00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:33.763
I shouldn't have kissed him.

399
00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:35.849
Why not?

400
00:23:35.873 --> 00:23:39.603
Because he's a player
and a client.

401
00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:42.522
We do not place
rules on sexual attraction.

402
00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:44.691
We have tantric workshops here.

403
00:23:44.715 --> 00:23:47.694
Still. it's not professional.

404
00:23:47.718 --> 00:23:50.780
Love. sex. and passion
usually aren't.

405
00:23:50.804 --> 00:23:54.952
But if this man gets your heart
and root chakra humming.

406
00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:56.769
why not enjoy yourself?

407
00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:01.316
And what if I fall
in love with him?

408
00:24:03.401 --> 00:24:05.611
Worse things have happened
to you. my dear.

409
00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:11.926
And what if he just wants sex
and not a relationship?

410
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.161
Did he tell you that?

411
00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:15.621
Not exactly.

412
00:24:16.998 --> 00:24:19.643
He wants to take me on a date.

413
00:24:19.667 --> 00:24:22.063
And other things.

414
00:24:22.087 --> 00:24:25.215
And do you want
these other things to?

415
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.343
Oh. yeah.

416
00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:32.781
Well. looks like
you have your answer.

417
00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:34.848
No. I don't.
I'm more confused than ever.

418

with him. casual or otherwise.

Now. let's do a
quick chakra readjust.

Can't have you spreading
this bad juju.

423
00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.688
I was trying meditation.

any grandparents. honey?

And then after he asked
Mary to call you Grandma.

954

confusing right now.

being so nice and...

a time with our own parents.

Sweetheart. That's why we need
to spend some quality time

It means you take
everything for granted.
