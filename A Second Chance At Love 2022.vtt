of it all ♪

7
00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.233
I believe love is defined
by two things.

8
00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:23.133
First. what we see.

9
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.467
Then. what we feel.

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.500
Dancing was a staple
in our house.

11
00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:31.333
It was my parents' personal
love language.

12
00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:32.700
But even more.

13
00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:35.066
I could feel the love in
everything we did together.

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200
♪ Just the two of us

15
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.166
♪ We can make it if we try

♪ Just the two of us

18
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.200
Our principles were simple.

19
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.200
Keep God and family first

20
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:51.000
and everything else
will work itself out.

21
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:55.300
My mom was my dad's queen
and I was his princess.

22
00:00:55.433 --> 00:01:01.033
It was perfect.
until it wasn't.

23
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.567
As my parents grew
in their respective careers.

24
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.200
work started to take precedent
over family.

25
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:10.033
And I guess we kind of
lost balance.

26
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.867
♪ We gotta go...

27
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.567
I'll never forget the day
my dad moved out.

28
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.066
It was the saddest day
of my life.

29
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.133
♪ We can make it...

30
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.300
They were growing apart

31
00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:22.567
and decided divorce
was the best option.

32
00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:27.467
Once Mema moved in
everything changed.

33
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.600
I went from a carefree princess
to a worrisome daughter.

34
00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:35.767
overly concerned with trying
to make everyone else happy.

35
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.200
As sad as I was.

36
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.767
I think I was more hurt
seeing my parents

37
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.900
become shells of themselves.

38
00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:47.066
I vowed that one day I would
perfect this thing called love.

39
00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:55.567
And now I have my own prince
to create my story with.

40
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.100
Mm-hmm! Oh!

41
00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:21.133
You still got it.

42
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.133
I still got it.

43
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.800
Someone woke up in
a good mood today.

44
00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:27.700
Well. this somebody happens
to be the luckiest man

45
00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:28.867
in the world.

46
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.700
Even after five long years
of marriage?

47
00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:34.767
Even after five
long. long...

48
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.600
Okay. okay.

49
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.100
So. this mood of yours
wouldn't have anything to do

50
00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:42.467
with a special upcoming date?

51
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.467
Upcoming date?

52
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.500
Ahh! Our anniversary.
I guess you got me.

53
00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:51.266
Someone has to bring
the excitement. right?

54
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.867
Excuse me?

55
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.800
Well you tend to be more of the
Debbie Downer around this time.

56
00:02:56.934 --> 00:02:59.500
Debbie Downer? Really?

57
00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:04.367
Okay. okay you're right.
But I mean we know why.

58
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.033
It's never about us.

59
00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:09.934
Well. this year
let's be intentional

60
00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:12.734
about making it about us.

61
00:03:12.867 --> 00:03:17.000
And possibly adding
a. you know.

62
00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:20.734
I hear you. Really.

63
00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.934
Starting tonight.

64
00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:24.033
Oh.

65
00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:25.166
What's oh?

66
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.867
I forgot I told Kam
that we could host

67
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
her and her new boyfriend
for dinner tonight.

68
00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:31.734
Why'd you do that?

69
00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:35.166
Sorry. I mean she just
really wants you to meet him.

70
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.867
Why me?

71
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.934
Because only a king
could recognize

72
00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:44.667
another potential king.

73
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.934
I guess. that cheesy line
is supposed to work on me?

74
00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:48.433
Did it?

75
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.500
You're so good to me.

76
00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:57.066
I promise after dinner
it's just you and me. okay?

77
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.734
- Can't wait.
- Bye.

78
00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:12.400
Oh. so nice of you
to join us.

79
00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:13.900
Please don't start.

80
00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:15.500
I actually had to stop by
the store for our date tonight.

81
00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:17.667
Oh. my bestie.

82
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.066
Uh-uh. now I'm your bestie?

83
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.967
Okay. I just need a minute
to get my chi together.

84
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.467
Well. you better put
your chi on pause.

85
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.433
Miss Sally's been waiting
for you since the doors opened.

86
00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:27.266
Oh.

87
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.433
Relax.

88
00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:29.834
I already did her shampoo
and conditioner.

89
00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:30.967
Oh. that's why I love you.

90
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.500
Mm-hmm.

91
00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:36.100
Well. actually I just wanted
to tell you more about Rahsaan.

92
00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:38.400
Girl. I can't thank you enough.

93
00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:41.266
I mean. as soon as you
told me he was a lawyer
I was interested.

94
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.433
Of course.

95
00:04:42.567 --> 00:04:44.900
No. but seriously.
He is so much more.

96
00:04:45.033 --> 00:04:49.100
Alicia. I'm telling you.
He's funny. a gentleman.

97
00:04:49.233 --> 00:04:52.633
Oh. and what I love the most is
that he's not flashy. you know?

98
00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:55.000
Girl. I do not need
his whole resume.

99
00:04:55.133 --> 00:04:56.834
Arnold is the one you need
to convince.

100
00:04:56.967 --> 00:04:59.967
He wasn't too thrilled about us
double dating tonight.

101
00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:03.200
Oh. please tell him to be nice.
We will not stay long.

102
00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:05.066
Oh. I know.

103
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.734
Oh. yeah. it's your anniversary
coming up.

104
00:05:08.867 --> 00:05:10.667
I hope you planned
something romantic.

105
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.066
Let me get this straight.

106
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.400
You think me having a romantic
evening with my husband

107
00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:16.400
will get him to sign off
on your relationship?

108
00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:18.533
You make it sound
so out of the question.

109
00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:26.467
Twist and down.
Up and down.

110
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.033
Scoop in. up and back two three.
like a rubber band.

111
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.033
And finish strong.

112
00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:35.834
All on the heel.

113
00:05:35.967 --> 00:05:37.333
Oh.

114
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.467
Looks great.
Apologies for interrupting.

115
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.567
Not at all.

116
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.033
Dr. Roberts. class
was actually ending.

117
00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.233
We were just going over
some new moves.

118
00:05:44.367 --> 00:05:45.800
Looks really good.

119
00:05:45.934 --> 00:05:48.300
Now remember that dancing is
bigger than the physical body.

120
00:05:48.433 --> 00:05:49.533
When you extend your arm

121
00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:53.066
the energy continues
past the fingers.

122
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.667
Claim the space.
Nice work everyone.

123
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.066
Those are great thoughts
to reflect on.

124
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.533
Uh. everyone. You heard
those words.

125
00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:02.433
Let's bring the action
on Thursday.

126
00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:05.233
Great job everyone.
Thank you.

127
00:06:05.367 --> 00:06:06.567
Just wanted to check in.

128
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.066
see how our new associate
professor is adjusting.

129
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.867
Everybody's raving
about your work.

130
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.533
Oh. that's great to hear.

131
00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:14.967
You know. we would love to have
you join us for a whole class.

132
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.300
Oh. no. no. no.
Those days are long gone.

133
00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:19.100
Oh. I beg to differ.

134
00:06:19.233 --> 00:06:22.066
You are considered an icon
in our industry.

135
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.533
Well. thank you.

136
00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:26.367
You know. I would love
to pick your brain over lunch.

137
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.400
It doesn't have to be today
or anything. but...

138
00:06:30.533 --> 00:06:31.934
Yeah. We should have lunch. definitely.

139
00:06:32.066 --> 00:06:35.133
We'll talk about choreography
and the studio. et cetera.

140
00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:36.600
That'd be great.

141
00:06:36.734 --> 00:06:38.533
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

142
00:06:45.433 --> 00:06:46.567
Woah. that looks great on you.

143
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.667
Really?

144
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.133
I don't know. I think I liked
the other one more.

145
00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:55.934
It's more comfortable.
I could move more in it.

146
00:06:56.066 --> 00:06:56.934
Just get both.

147
00:06:57.066 --> 00:07:00.834
- Jack. it's not...
- No. I insist.

148
00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:03.633
Well. if you insist.

149
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.533
Yes. Morgan you'll have
to reprint all the programs.

150
00:07:11.667 --> 00:07:14.333
They are not going out with
all those grammatical errors.

151
00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:16.600
Okay. thank you.

152
00:07:16.734 --> 00:07:19.000
Nobody proofreads anymore.

153
00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:20.333
I'm sorry I'm late.

154
00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:22.133
You know how hard it is for me
to leave campus

155
00:07:22.266 --> 00:07:24.367
without running into 20 people
who needs something from me.

156
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.633
I understand.

157
00:07:26.767 --> 00:07:31.300
Hmm. I can't go into my next
meeting smelling like tuna.

158
00:07:31.433 --> 00:07:33.533
I apologize. I know.
it's not your look.

159
00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:35.033
I'll make it up
to you tonight.

160
00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:37.533
I'll come over. I'll make
my famous spaghetti.

161
00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:38.867
You know how much Arnold
loves it.

162
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.100
Yeah. That he does.
But um. I can't tonight.

163
00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:44.266
I'm actually having Kam
and her new boyfriend over.

164
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.633
Ah.

165
00:07:45.767 --> 00:07:47.633
But. I mean. I can cancel
if you want.

166
00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.033
Oh. don't be ridiculous.

167
00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:50.300
You sure?

168
00:07:50.433 --> 00:07:51.800
I'm fine. Of course.
of course. of course.

169
00:07:51.934 --> 00:07:53.667
I'll still make the spaghetti.
I'll save some for Arnold.

170
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.800
And. I mean. Mema
still has to eat.

171
00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:58.367
Mema probably
has a date tonight.

172
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.400
You're right.
She probably does.

173
00:08:01.533 --> 00:08:04.700
But still. it's all right.
I'm fine.

174
00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:08.800
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Just you and your work.

175
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.333
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:13.467 --> 00:08:15.333
Mom. don't you think it's time

177
00:08:15.467 --> 00:08:18.700
that maybe you got
back out there?

178
00:08:18.834 --> 00:08:21.900
Where exactly is
"there" located?

179
00:08:22.033 --> 00:08:23.500
Look. just because
I'm alone

180
00:08:23.633 --> 00:08:25.266
doesn't mean I'm lonely.

181
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.867
And also I have you.
What else do I need?

182
00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:31.667
- Um.
- Go ahead.

183
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.100
Okay. really. I will make it up
to you next time.

184
00:08:34.233 --> 00:08:37.266
It'll just be you and me.
No phones. okay?

185
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.834
I promise. I love you.

186
00:08:38.967 --> 00:08:39.867
Love you.

187
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.867
Hi there. Yep. okay.
On my way...

188
00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.233
Well. the good news is

189
00:08:55.367 --> 00:08:56.767
I think you got one for
every day of the week now.

190
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.567
I think you might be right.

191
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.567
Yeah.

192
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.834
Hey princess.

193
00:09:07.967 --> 00:09:10.300
Hey. Oh. I didn't realize
you were out.

194
00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:12.233
I can try you later
if you want.

195
00:09:12.367 --> 00:09:13.600
No. no. no.
Timing's perfect.

196
00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:15.667
Um. I'm actually out with Jada.
You want to say hi?

197
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.633
Um. no. That's okay. Dad.

198
00:09:17.767 --> 00:09:19.800
Hey Alicia.
Nice to see you.

199
00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.767
Hi Jada.

200
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.600
Hey. so what's up?

201
00:09:23.734 --> 00:09:24.800
Oh. nothing.

202
00:09:24.934 --> 00:09:27.266
I just wanted to see
if you were free but...

203
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.734
We're actually heading
to lunch.

204
00:09:28.867 --> 00:09:30.467
You want to come with? I can
swing by and pick you up.

205
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.567
Oh. that's okay.

206
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.967
I just ate. but maybe
next time?

207
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.000
All right.
Well. love you.

208
00:09:34.133 --> 00:09:37.700
Love you too.
Take care. Bye.

209
00:09:47.633 --> 00:09:51.133
I mean. most importantly
the work is rewarding.

210
00:09:51.266 --> 00:09:54.900
Long hours and way
too much paperwork?

211
00:09:55.033 --> 00:09:56.834
Thankfully I get to see
this beautiful face

212
00:09:56.967 --> 00:09:58.100
when I'm not working.

213
00:09:58.233 --> 00:10:01.133
Oh. isn't he cute?

214
00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:03.133
He's doing so much
for the community.

215
00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:04.400
That's great. man.

216
00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:05.667
I wish this web developer
could share about

217
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.433
how his work is inspiring
the world.

218
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:09.934
Don't sell yourself short. boo.

219
00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:12.233
The apps that you create
help us all stay connected.

220
00:10:12.367 --> 00:10:14.467
- It's important work.
- Thank you.

221
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.934
Do those dating apps
really work?

222
00:10:16.066 --> 00:10:17.433
I mean. sure.

223
00:10:17.567 --> 00:10:20.400
Um. some people seem
to find them effective.

224
00:10:20.533 --> 00:10:21.934
Different times I guess. huh?

225
00:10:22.066 --> 00:10:23.433
Yeah.

226
00:10:23.567 --> 00:10:25.133
Can you imagine our parents
meeting through a phone app?

227
00:10:25.266 --> 00:10:27.633
Well. my parents were destined
to fill each other's life

228
00:10:27.767 --> 00:10:30.767
with torture. no matter if
they met through technology.

229
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.900
arranged marriage. or
any other dating means.

230
00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:41.633
What about your parents?

231
00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:44.967
What's that? Oh. they
are divorced.

232
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.400
I'm sorry to hear. Uh...

233
00:10:46.533 --> 00:10:49.066
No. it's fine.
It's been years.

234
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.000
But. yeah. they would not
fare well on those apps.

235
00:10:52.133 --> 00:10:57.066
My mom is too busy to search
for herself. and my dad...

236
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.433
well he doesn't even know
what he's searching for.

237
00:10:59.567 --> 00:11:02.700
Well. I'm thankful for you
pairing us together.

238
00:11:02.834 --> 00:11:04.033
That's right.

239
00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:06.567
Because lord knows I didn't know
what I was doing.

240
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.567
Mm-mm.

241
00:11:08.967 --> 00:11:10.166
To The Love Doctor.

242
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.333
To The Love Doctor.

243
00:11:11.467 --> 00:11:12.633
Love Doctor.

244
00:11:12.767 --> 00:11:14.600
I'll take it.
Thanks for coming.

245
00:11:19.367 --> 00:11:21.300
That Rahsaan seemed
pretty cool.

246
00:11:21.433 --> 00:11:24.300
Bit of a know-it-all.
but he's cool.

247
00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:29.166
My dad texted earlier that he
and Jada agreed to take a break.

248
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.367
Which means he broke up
with her.

249
00:11:32.934 --> 00:11:34.667
Well. you didn't care too much
for her anyway. right?

250
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.166
She was okay.

251
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.533
I mean. it really wasn't
about her.

252
00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:42.500
He's always finding these women.
building them up.

253
00:11:42.633 --> 00:11:45.467
and then when things get
too serious he just leaves.

254
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.800
I'm just so over both of them.

255
00:11:46.934 --> 00:11:48.467
I mean. my mom isn't any better.

256
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.967
On a positive note
it seems like The Love Doctor

257
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.867
has scored another one
with Kam and Rahsaan.

258
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.400
I did. didn't I?

259
00:11:56.533 --> 00:11:58.567
Maybe we should get you to
design one of our dating apps.

260
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.700
Maybe.

261
00:12:00.834 --> 00:12:03.367
Anyway. enough about everyone
else for the night.

262
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.600
I just want to cuddle up.

263
00:12:05.734 --> 00:12:07.633
Now that I can get with.

264
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.133
That can't be.

265
00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:15.633
But we both know it is.

266
00:12:15.767 --> 00:12:17.266
Are you sure you don't
want some. Arnold?

267
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.633
I made plenty.

268
00:12:18.767 --> 00:12:20.400
I thought your friends
were still going to be here.

269
00:12:20.533 --> 00:12:21.700
Oh no. I'm fine.
Thank you. Brenda.

270
00:12:21.834 --> 00:12:24.233
That is really thoughtful
of you. Mom.

271
00:12:24.367 --> 00:12:27.266
Yeah. Definitely a surprise.

272
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.867
You know. I'm actually
about to head to bed. so.

273
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.900
Should I go?

274
00:12:33.033 --> 00:12:35.100
No. no. no. no. Mom.
You're fine.

275
00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:36.900
Are you sure? I don't want
to stay too long.

276
00:12:37.033 --> 00:12:38.367
I don't want to intrude.

277
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.600
No.

278
00:12:39.734 --> 00:12:40.967
It's cold in here.
Are you cold?

279
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.567
- Just a little.
- Yes. It's chilly.

280
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.700
I'll turn it up.

281
00:12:43.834 --> 00:12:44.767
Oh. thanks.

282
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.800
- Thanks babe.
- So nice.

283
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.066
He's such a good man.
You better take care of him.

284
00:13:05.266 --> 00:13:06.266
What is this?

285
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.900
Hmm.

286
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:17.834
"Organic Chemistry brings back
the concept of courting.

287
00:13:17.967 --> 00:13:20.700
"parties involved are truly
able to communicate.

288
00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:23.433
"taking the time to create
a bond while discovering

289
00:13:23.567 --> 00:13:27.467
"the other person both
mentally and emotionally."

290
00:13:35.333 --> 00:13:36.467
Babe.

291
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.300
I think I just solved
our problem.

292
00:13:38.433 --> 00:13:39.300
Well. in a sense you did.

293
00:13:39.433 --> 00:13:40.333
And before you say anything.

294
00:13:40.467 --> 00:13:42.900
the solution doesn't
even involve me.

295
00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:45.367
What are we talking about?

296
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.934
Your new dating app.
Organic Chemistry.

297
00:13:47.066 --> 00:13:48.767
It's perfect for my parents.

298
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.867
Wait. what? This seems
like a lot.

299
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.667
You really think
they'd go for it?

300
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.266
You just said that your mom
thinks she's fine.

301
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.100
Besides we designed this app

302
00:13:59.233 --> 00:14:01.600
specifically for
open-minded people.

303
00:14:01.734 --> 00:14:06.500
What are you trying to say?
True. she will be a hard sell.

304
00:14:06.633 --> 00:14:09.266
But once I convince her that
we need our space. then...

305
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.533
Like you did tonight?

306
00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:13.066
Fair. I probably
should've spoken up.

307
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.433
But this babe. this is
our ticket to freedom.

308
00:14:16.567 --> 00:14:19.100
Are you excited?
This is good.

309
00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:28.533
Hey Dad. Wait. wait. wait.
slow down.

310
00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:30.066
No. A DM's not an app.

311
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.300
It's when you directly
message someone.

312
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.000
Let me get my "I told you so"
out of the way now.

313
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.367
No. no. no.

314
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.367
So that's what this
daughter-daddy time is?

315
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.400
You trying to get me to use
some new dating service?

316
00:14:55.533 --> 00:14:57.633
The apps I'm using
are just fine.

317
00:14:57.767 --> 00:14:59.700
First of all. you just learned
what an app is.

318
00:14:59.834 --> 00:15:01.934
And secondly. I brought
you here

319
00:15:02.066 --> 00:15:05.333
because I love spending time
with my dad.

320
00:15:05.467 --> 00:15:08.533
And I would argue that your
dating life isn't going well.

321
00:15:08.667 --> 00:15:10.266
Just saying.

322
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.433
What are you talking about?
My life is just fine.

323
00:15:13.567 --> 00:15:14.500
What. Jada?

324
00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:15.600
Mm-hmm.

325
00:15:16.834 --> 00:15:18.700
She wanted something
I couldn't give her.

326
00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:20.533
That's the problem. Dad.

327
00:15:20.667 --> 00:15:25.367
I mean. every time things
get serious you get cold feet.

328
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.300
Here. It's the latest
from Arnold's company.

329
00:15:28.433 --> 00:15:29.967
Organic Chemistry.

330
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.600
It's dedicated to helping people
like yourself to take the time

331
00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:35.934
to create a bond while
discovering the other person

332
00:15:36.066 --> 00:15:38.100
both emotionally
and mentally first.

333
00:15:39.567 --> 00:15:40.834
Why do I feel like I'm listening
to an infomercial.

334
00:15:40.967 --> 00:15:43.166
Basically. it's not like
those other dating sites

335
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.333
where you're simply swiping

336
00:15:44.467 --> 00:15:45.800
based off of physical appearance.

337
00:15:45.934 --> 00:15:49.967
That's what's been steering
you wrong. Dad.

338
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.600
I'm just trying
to help you out.

339
00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:53.633
I'm fine.

340
00:15:53.767 --> 00:15:54.867
Oh. come on.
just give it a try.

341
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.367
If you don't like it.
I won't bug you again.

342
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.600
So. I'm assuming that means
if I don't try

343
00:15:58.734 --> 00:16:00.600
you're going to keep bugging me
until I do.

344
00:16:00.734 --> 00:16:03.700
- Every day.
- Yeah.

345
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.367
Okay. that's better.

346
00:16:17.033 --> 00:16:18.266
I gotta say.
I just can't believe

347
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.600
I'm taking class with
the great Dr. Roberts.

348
00:16:21.734 --> 00:16:24.100
You're from Ailey.
to Philadanco.

349
00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:25.266
to Ronald K. Brown Evidence.

350
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.600
I mean. I could go on.

351
00:16:26.734 --> 00:16:28.533
It's flattering that you know
my resume so much.

352
00:16:28.667 --> 00:16:31.266
You've created a great body
of work yourself.

353
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.600
Well. hopefully
under your tutelage

354
00:16:33.734 --> 00:16:35.867
it will only continue
to grow.

355
00:16:38.033 --> 00:16:39.200
Hey Mom.

356
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.567
Oh hi. This is a nice surprise.

357
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.734
Yeah. Just thought
I'd stop by and say hi.

358
00:16:44.867 --> 00:16:45.867
- Hi.
- Hi.

359
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

360
00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:50.600
Mr. Staples. this is
my daughter. Alicia.

361
00:16:50.734 --> 00:16:52.000
Alicia. this is Mr. Staples.

362
00:16:52.133 --> 00:16:53.433
He's our new associate professor.

363
00:16:53.567 --> 00:16:56.233
He's bringing some fresh energy
into the program.

364
00:16:56.367 --> 00:16:57.734
You're too kind.
A pleasure to meet you.

365
00:16:57.867 --> 00:16:58.934
Likewise.

366
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.967
All right. Well. um. thank you
again. Dr. Roberts.

367
00:17:06.633 --> 00:17:08.467
Looking forward to putting
our lesson today into practice.

368
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.767
Great. Good work.

369
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.400
Ladies.

370
00:17:12.533 --> 00:17:13.500
Take care.

371
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.867
Okay.

372
00:17:17.967 --> 00:17:18.767
What?

373
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.000
Oh. nothing.
Nothing at all.

374
00:17:21.133 --> 00:17:23.166
Now. I know why you've been
so busy with work.

375
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.734
Oh. please.

376
00:17:24.867 --> 00:17:27.433
My relationship with Mr. Staples
is completely professional.

377
00:17:27.567 --> 00:17:30.734
- -Okay. Dr.
- Roberts.

378
00:17:32.233 --> 00:17:35.266
Anyway. I know you didn't come
here just to say hi.

379
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.133
What's up?

380
00:17:36.266 --> 00:17:38.934
How rude. but okay. Here.

381
00:17:39.066 --> 00:17:40.266
What's this?

382
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.433
It's an online dating app
from Arnold's company.

383
00:17:42.567 --> 00:17:43.834
They developed it. It's-

384
00:17:43.967 --> 00:17:44.934
Nope.

385
00:17:45.066 --> 00:17:47.000
Hear me out.
It's completely legit.

386
00:17:47.133 --> 00:17:49.433
I think this could be a good
option for you. Mom.

387
00:17:49.567 --> 00:17:51.934
Option implies that
I'm looking and I'm not.

388
00:17:52.066 --> 00:17:53.166
And I get that.

389
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.100
But that doesn't mean
you're not missing out.

390
00:17:55.233 --> 00:17:57.734
Look. I know you love spending
time with me and Arnold.

391
00:17:57.867 --> 00:18:01.333
I just want you to have
the same thing for yourself.

392
00:18:01.467 --> 00:18:02.500
Is this your way of telling me

393
00:18:02.633 --> 00:18:03.967
that I'm too much
of a third wheel?

394
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.633
No. No. not at all. Mom.
We love your company. It's-

395
00:18:07.767 --> 00:18:09.300
Look. I really appreciate
your genuine concern.

396
00:18:09.433 --> 00:18:10.800
but I am fine.

397
00:18:10.934 --> 00:18:13.734
And online dating.
it's not my thing.

398
00:18:13.867 --> 00:18:15.734
Well. dating is not really
your thing. Mom.

399
00:18:17.266 --> 00:18:19.166
Yes. there is a stigma
with finding someone online.

400
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.367
but this site seems genuinely
dedicated to helping people

401
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.000
make genuine connections.

402
00:18:24.133 --> 00:18:28.200
I'm sure it is.
But it's a hard no.

403
00:18:28.333 --> 00:18:30.133
Look. can you at least
browse the app?

404
00:18:30.266 --> 00:18:31.333
I don't even know
what that means.

405
00:18:31.467 --> 00:18:32.800
Come on. I have to go.

406
00:18:34.367 --> 00:18:36.633
Promise me then you'll at least
find some time for yourself?

407
00:18:36.767 --> 00:18:38.367
I can't have you becoming
one of the Golden Girls.

408
00:18:46.967 --> 00:18:50.667
Thank you. Clearly you can see
I'm vertically challenged.

409
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.266
Um...

410
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.667
Well. you have a good night.

411
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.633
Thanks. You too.

412
00:18:59.767 --> 00:19:01.066
Thanks.

413
00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:08.100
Hey there.

414
00:19:08.233 --> 00:19:10.800
I was just about to call you.
You need anything while I'm out?

415
00:19:10.934 --> 00:19:12.467
No. But I wanted to call you

416
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.533
to tell you that The Love Doctor
strikes again.

417
00:19:16.667 --> 00:19:18.100
Oh boy. What are you
talking about?

418
00:19:18.233 --> 00:19:20.533
You said my parents wouldn't be
on board with the dating app.

419
00:19:20.667 --> 00:19:22.133
They actually said yes?

420
00:19:22.266 --> 00:19:26.934
Well. my dad is a solid yes.
My mom. soft no.

421
00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:30.266
But when I ask her tomorrow
she'll be in.

422
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.200
You know what's not funny

423
00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:35.900
is I believe you used
that same strategy on me.

424
00:19:36.033 --> 00:19:36.967
Maybe.

425
00:19:38.533 --> 00:19:39.400
I love you.

426
00:19:39.533 --> 00:19:40.834
I love you too.

427
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.800
Hey Mom. Did you want
to play another game?

428
00:19:56.934 --> 00:19:57.767
Hmm?

429
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.200
I had a long day at work

430
00:19:59.333 --> 00:20:01.734
so I hope you don't mind eating
the leftover spaghetti.

431
00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:04.367
- I actually ordered Chinese.
- Mmm.

432
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.100
That's even better.
Are you wearing makeup?

433
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.066
- Hi.
- Hi. Come on in.

434
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.300
Mm. Smells good.

435
00:20:16.433 --> 00:20:18.066
We can go upstairs if you want
to stay down here.

436
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.200
No. Hello Mr. Cornelius.
It's nice to see you again.

437
00:20:22.333 --> 00:20:23.033
Hi.

438
00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:24.867
Yeah. Okay.

439
00:20:27.834 --> 00:20:28.633
Gotcha.

440
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.066
- Look at this.
- No!

441
00:20:33.834 --> 00:20:34.700
Take that.

442
00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:36.800
Tell Alicia and Arnold
I said hi.

443
00:20:36.934 --> 00:20:37.967
Excuse me?

444
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.934
You're going over
to their house. right?

445
00:20:40.066 --> 00:20:41.700
I mean. where else would
you be going at this hour?

446
00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:45.233
- Hit me. hit me. come on.
- Oh.

447
00:20:45.367 --> 00:20:48.433
I thought I heard
something outside.

448
00:20:48.567 --> 00:20:50.934
- Put one down.
- Come on. give me a shot.

449
00:20:51.066 --> 00:20:52.066
Come on now.

450
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.533
No. everything's all right.

451
00:20:53.667 --> 00:20:57.600
No. you're too lucky.
What are you doing? No!

452
00:20:57.734 --> 00:20:59.100
Okay. Bren.

453
00:21:00.967 --> 00:21:02.934
You're too lucky.

454
00:21:11.834 --> 00:21:14.100
I wonder who that could be.

455
00:21:14.233 --> 00:21:15.333
Hey Mom.

456
00:21:15.467 --> 00:21:18.433
I can't believe what
I'm about to ask you.

457
00:21:18.567 --> 00:21:21.133
What was the name
of that site again?

458
00:21:21.266 --> 00:21:22.533
Mom. really?

459
00:21:22.667 --> 00:21:25.633
You're going to do it?
This is good. this is good.

460
00:21:25.767 --> 00:21:27.633
Okay. please calm down.

461
00:21:27.767 --> 00:21:30.333
Okay. Um. I will call
you tomorrow

462
00:21:30.467 --> 00:21:32.200
and we'll walk through it.

463
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:35.300
Okay. You won't regret it.
I promise.

464
00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.300
I don't even want to know.

465
00:21:38.433 --> 00:21:40.266
She's going to do it.

466
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.667
The Love Doctor
strikes again.

467
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.767
Okay.

468
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:43.700
I did it.

469
00:21:45.066 --> 00:21:46.900
So you want me to put
my picture up on this site

470
00:21:47.033 --> 00:21:48.734
but I can't see
the other person's?

471
00:21:48.867 --> 00:21:52.433
Yes Mom. But they can't see
you either.

472
00:21:52.567 --> 00:21:54.166
It gives you a chance
to really open up

473
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.066
before the other person's
picture starts to unblur.

474
00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.433
I don't know. Sounds
a little strange to me.

475
00:21:59.567 --> 00:22:02.166
Dad. trust me.
It's safe.

476
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.567
Okay. remember.

477
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.600
Connect emotionally and then
you get to meet them.

478
00:22:06.734 --> 00:22:08.166
Think of it this way.

479
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:12.133
It gives you a little
more mystique.

480
00:22:12.266 --> 00:22:14.800
And women actually like
a little mystery. Dad.

481
00:22:14.934 --> 00:22:17.266
All right. Mom.
How does this sound?

482
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:22.967
An ambitious entrepreneur
looking for a dancing partner.

483
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.900
I don't know. It sounds
a little...

484
00:22:25.033 --> 00:22:27.000
A little true. Mom.
you can't fool me.

485
00:22:27.133 --> 00:22:28.266
I know you're tired
of being alone.

486
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.000
Okay fine. But also put serious
inquiries only.

487
00:22:33.133 --> 00:22:36.100
Okay. "Doctor Roberts."

488
00:22:36.233 --> 00:22:38.900
All right. So I'm looking
for an independent woman

489
00:22:39.033 --> 00:22:40.300
that exudes confidence.

490
00:22:40.433 --> 00:22:42.433
That all sounds fine and
everything but where's the fun?

491
00:22:42.567 --> 00:22:44.000
Movies. dancing.

492
00:22:44.133 --> 00:22:48.000
Bingo. Dad. you are a retired
corporate attorney.

493
00:22:48.133 --> 00:22:50.667
You need to start entertaining
a serious relationship.

494
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.900
not one where you're just paying
for everything.

495
00:22:54.033 --> 00:22:59.100
All right. All I need now is
the name that you want to go by.

496
00:22:59.233 --> 00:23:00.967
What do you want
the most out of this?

497
00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.567
I want you to stop bothering me
and giving me a headache.

498
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:09.133
Hmm. Sounds like
"Finding Peace."

499
00:23:09.266 --> 00:23:12.166
Just a good time.
Nothing too serious.

500
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.800
Laughter's a must.

501
00:23:13.934 --> 00:23:18.333
Perfect. "Looking to Laugh"
it is.

502
00:23:18.467 --> 00:23:23.100
Trust me. The Love Doctor's
got this.

503
00:23:31.266 --> 00:23:33.400
Oh. come on.
The wind took that.

504
00:23:33.533 --> 00:23:35.367
You know. I've seen you play
in real life. right?

505
00:23:36.867 --> 00:23:38.300
What's going on?

506
00:23:38.433 --> 00:23:40.967
I'm trying to figure out
what to do for our anniversary.

507
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.200
Five years in the game

508
00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:44.900
and I think it's time
that we add to the team.

509
00:23:45.033 --> 00:23:46.400
How's Alicia feeling
about that?

510
00:23:46.533 --> 00:23:48.367
She's so busy playing
matchmaker for her folks

511
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.633
that her mother might end up
having a child before we do.

512
00:23:51.667 --> 00:23:52.734
For real.

513
00:23:52.867 --> 00:23:55.400
She set them both up
on Organic Chemistry.

514
00:23:55.533 --> 00:23:56.066
Our site?

515
00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.367
Uh-huh.

516
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.367
Oh. well that's a win. right?

517
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.066
The quicker you can get them out
of y'all hairs.

518
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.734
the quicker you two can get
to the game plan.

519
00:24:04.867 --> 00:24:07.300
I guess. later.

520
00:24:07.433 --> 00:24:09.400
Alright. You know where
to find me.

521
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.867
Swish.

522
00:24:13.834 --> 00:24:17.633
So. is Rahsaan the one?

523
00:24:17.767 --> 00:24:19.633
I don't know about all that.

524
00:24:19.767 --> 00:24:22.767
but he's definitely the one
for right now.

525
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.600
Girl. I am not messing
with you.

526
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.133
You need to be messing
with your husband.

527
00:24:29.266 --> 00:24:31.367
Starting that again. huh?

528
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.133
I'm not starting nothing.

529
00:24:33.266 --> 00:24:34.967
You know how you get
when you start playing cupid

530
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.867
for everyone but yourself.

531
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.100
Okay. so what?

532
00:24:38.233 --> 00:24:39.467
You're in a relationship
for two weeks

533
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.133
and suddenly you're
a relationship expert?

534
00:24:42.266 --> 00:24:46.934
Hmm. And on that note.
thanks for closing up.

535
00:24:47.066 --> 00:24:47.934
Wait? What?

536
00:24:48.934 --> 00:24:50.400
Bye sis. Love you.

537
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.000
Love you. too.

538
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.800
So. how was your day?

539
00:24:58.934 --> 00:25:02.266
It was fine.
How about yours?

540
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.667
Same. Oh um. Kam said things
are heating up

541
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.433
between her and Rahsaan.

542
00:25:08.567 --> 00:25:10.000
Score one for
The Love Doctor.

543
00:25:10.133 --> 00:25:11.834
Hmm. And I'm almost done

544
00:25:11.967 --> 00:25:13.767
setting up my parents
for romance.

545
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.834
Wow. make that three.

546
00:25:15.967 --> 00:25:20.934
Hey babe. the game's about
to start. Do you mind if I...

547
00:25:21.066 --> 00:25:23.233
- Yeah. sure.
- Yeah?

548
00:25:38.433 --> 00:25:40.667
Hey babe. I'm just
going to go

549
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.133
finish up their profiles
real quick.

550
00:25:42.266 --> 00:25:47.700
but do you want to cuddle up
and watch a movie after?

551
00:25:47.834 --> 00:25:48.800
Sure.

552
00:25:48.934 --> 00:25:53.333
Yeah. if I'm. if I'm still up. Yeah.

553
00:25:53.467 --> 00:25:54.800
Oh. okay.

554
00:26:22.967 --> 00:26:27.033
Everything is plant-based
and mostly raw.

555
00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:30.767
Oh. so good.

556
00:26:40.233 --> 00:26:42.834
M-mom? You're exaggerating
okay?

557
00:26:42.967 --> 00:26:43.934
It couldn't have been that bad.

558
00:26:44.066 --> 00:26:45.100
It was worse.

559
00:26:45.233 --> 00:26:47.200
The first date got
separation anxiety

560
00:26:47.333 --> 00:26:49.533
when I told him to put
his phone away.

561
00:26:49.667 --> 00:26:52.767
The second date. he needed a job
and he was 15 minutes late.

562
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.367
and he had the nerve to say that
he left his wallet in the car.

563
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.567
Are you serious?
What did you do?

564
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.633
I waited for him
to go get it.

565
00:27:02.767 --> 00:27:05.400
Well. I mean you can't
give up

566
00:27:05.533 --> 00:27:07.300
after one or two
bad experiences.

567
00:27:07.433 --> 00:27:09.967
I mean I will admit the whole
experience reminded me

568
00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.767
of how much I like a
little companionship.

569
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.233
So maybe I'm open to finding
someone again but not like this.

570
00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:17.500
All right. I'm going to get
some rest. I love you.

571
00:27:17.633 --> 00:27:19.000
I love you too.

572
00:27:19.133 --> 00:27:21.400
Say hi to Arnold and try
to stop by later this week.

573
00:27:21.533 --> 00:27:26.900
I will. And sure. Bye.

574
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.667
You okay?

575
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.100
Go ahead. You know you want
to say you were right.

576
00:27:38.233 --> 00:27:42.567
What? No. that's not...
that's not like me.

577
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.133
But I mean. was I right?

578
00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:48.233
No?

579
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.834
Online dating's
for millennials.

580
00:27:52.967 --> 00:27:55.266
I just need a good book.

581
00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.333
Although having someone to laugh
with wouldn't be so bad.

582
00:28:00.467 --> 00:28:02.166
No. I'm going to cancel
this account right now.

583
00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:08.400
Oh. my god. you are so funny.
Too funny.

584
00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.000
Finding Peace?

585
00:29:22.433 --> 00:29:24.333
I thought I would surprise you.
I hope that's okay.

586
00:29:24.467 --> 00:29:25.300
Wow.

587
00:29:25.433 --> 00:29:26.066
Hi Marcus.

588
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.166
Hey.

589
00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:30.100
See you later.

590
00:29:46.867 --> 00:29:49.000
What?

591
00:29:49.133 --> 00:29:55.233
Nothing. It's just really nice.
And needed.

592
00:29:55.367 --> 00:29:57.333
Which reminds me.

593
00:30:06.934 --> 00:30:10.867
What about a log cabin
for our anniversary?

594
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.800
They say the traditional
fifth year gift is wood.

595
00:30:14.934 --> 00:30:16.533
Think about it.

596
00:30:16.667 --> 00:30:20.233
Just you and I. nestled up
in front of a warm fire.

597
00:30:20.367 --> 00:30:22.233
Mm. That does sound nice.

598
00:30:22.367 --> 00:30:23.800
Mm-hmm.

599
00:30:23.934 --> 00:30:26.900
I just know with my schedule
it's just hard to get away.

600
00:30:28.467 --> 00:30:30.767
I should've thought about that.

601
00:30:31.133 --> 00:30:33.567
But you might be
onto something.

602
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.867
How about we do some
sort of staycation?

603
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.467
Maybe a room at a fancy hotel?

604
00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.800
Mm-hmm.

605
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.467
Okay. You're not going
to believe this.

606
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.700
but guess who has
a date tonight?

607
00:30:48.834 --> 00:30:50.367
Who? Not your mother.

608
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.467
Yeah.

609
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.300
Well. that's good.
You should go call her.

610
00:30:55.433 --> 00:30:56.567
You sure?

611
00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.867
Yes. yeah. please.
Before she shows up here.

612
00:31:00.066 --> 00:31:01.767
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

613
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.200
But you know how the last
few dates turned out.

614
00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:05.734
You know what?
You're right.

615
00:31:05.867 --> 00:31:08.967
I should probably go meet her.
Yeah. I'm going to go help.

616
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.800
Yeah. that makes sense.

617
00:31:10.934 --> 00:31:14.100
I think I might head to happy
hour with Marcus anyway.

618
00:31:14.233 --> 00:31:15.633
Okay. Sounds good.

619
00:31:15.767 --> 00:31:17.400
Just make sure to bring
this home with you.

620
00:31:17.533 --> 00:31:19.533
I love you.
This was great.

621
00:31:19.667 --> 00:31:20.433
We'll do more of this.

622
00:31:24.867 --> 00:31:27.433
Alicia was a nice surprise.

623
00:31:27.567 --> 00:31:31.867
Yeah. It was cool.
Definitely unexpected.

624
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.200
Sounds like there's
a "but" coming.

625
00:31:34.333 --> 00:31:36.567
No. it was great.

626
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.100
But it's just that the other
day I was in the store.

627
00:31:40.233 --> 00:31:41.567
Mm-hmm.

628
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.734
And this woman. she smiled
at me and I don't know...

629
00:31:45.867 --> 00:31:47.567
What do you mean?

630
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.033
No. no. no.
Nothing like that.

631
00:31:50.166 --> 00:31:53.300
Look. I guess it just felt good
to feel attractive.

632
00:31:53.433 --> 00:31:54.533
You know I love my wife.

633
00:31:54.667 --> 00:31:56.734
See. the worst phrase
a man can start with

634
00:31:56.867 --> 00:31:57.867
is "you know I love my wife."

635
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.433
Okay. no look.

636
00:31:59.567 --> 00:32:02.633
Lately it just feels like we've
been going through the motions

637
00:32:02.767 --> 00:32:05.367
and the intimacy's been missing.

638
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.433
Have you shared this with her?

639
00:32:06.567 --> 00:32:08.166
Yeah. yeah.
I know. I know.

640
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.100
- Look. I always tell you. man.
- I gotta communicate.

641
00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:18.100
Oh yes. Yes. yes. yes.

642
00:32:18.233 --> 00:32:20.800
Wow. Mom. You look amazing.

643
00:32:20.934 --> 00:32:21.934
You really think so?

644
00:32:22.066 --> 00:32:25.033
Of course. Here. let me
take a photo.

645
00:32:28.133 --> 00:32:29.600
I feel like it's prom.

646
00:32:29.734 --> 00:32:31.033
You do look nice.

647
00:32:31.166 --> 00:32:32.266
Thanks.

648
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.367
Leaving nothing to
the imagination. but...

649
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.200
Oh.

650
00:32:34.333 --> 00:32:35.533
Mema. she's fine.

651
00:32:35.667 --> 00:32:37.834
Still don't know who
this mystery man is. though.

652
00:32:37.967 --> 00:32:40.300
Well. we decided to reveal
our faces in public.

653
00:32:40.433 --> 00:32:43.633
We thought it would be fun
to just wait and see.

654
00:32:43.767 --> 00:32:45.467
So. he's not even coming
to pick you up.

655
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.934
Nope. I'm meeting him
at the restaurant.

656
00:32:48.467 --> 00:32:50.700
In my day. a gentleman escorted
the lady on their date.

657
00:32:50.834 --> 00:32:52.166
In your day. I don't think
a gentleman

658
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.300
even saw a woman at night
unless they were married.

659
00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.300
Oh!

660
00:32:56.433 --> 00:32:57.433
Ooh. I got you.

661
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.934
Okay. Just make sure you call
me if you need anything.

662
00:33:02.066 --> 00:33:02.767
Anything.

663
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.400
Just relax.

664
00:33:04.533 --> 00:33:05.433
Aren't you the one
who encouraged me
to get back out there?

665
00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:07.533
I'm fine. And thank you.

666
00:33:09.533 --> 00:33:10.767
You got this.

667
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.000
Brenda?

668
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.767
Brenda?

669
00:33:41.233 --> 00:33:42.000
Jack?

670
00:33:42.133 --> 00:33:43.333
What are you doing here?

671
00:33:43.467 --> 00:33:44.567
Uh...

672
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.066
I mean. this is weird.
the two of us. you know.

673
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.867
Well. I don't mean like that.
I mean.

674
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.166
Why am I talking
with my hands?

675
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.266
Uh. hi. Wow.

676
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.834
It's... This is. this is crazy.

677
00:33:56.967 --> 00:33:58.333
Look at you.
You look stunning.

678
00:33:58.467 --> 00:34:00.667
Well. thank you.

679
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.800
I. I can't. I can't
believe this. um...

680
00:34:03.934 --> 00:34:06.066
I know right?
It's been a minute.

681
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.767
Yeah. What. since
Alicia's wedding?

682
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.900
Alicia's wedding.
That's right.

683
00:34:11.033 --> 00:34:14.400
Yeah. Wow. That was
a beautiful day.

684
00:34:14.533 --> 00:34:15.767
It really was.

685
00:34:16.967 --> 00:34:18.233
Hey look. You know.
I don't...

686
00:34:18.367 --> 00:34:19.600
I don't want to hold you up
or anything.

687
00:34:19.734 --> 00:34:21.100
I just wanted to come
and say hi.

688
00:34:21.233 --> 00:34:23.166
Yeah well you know. I don't
want to hold you up either.

689
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.767
I mean. I assume you're
with someone.

690
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.567
Yeah. well I mean they're
not here yet.

691
00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:31.266
But um. I mean you're
welcome to have a seat if...

692
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.166
Oh. no. no. no.

693
00:34:33.367 --> 00:34:34.233
I wouldn't want
your lady friend to.

694
00:34:34.367 --> 00:34:35.600
you know. look at
me sideways.

695
00:34:38.433 --> 00:34:40.100
It's not even like that.

696
00:34:40.233 --> 00:34:41.667
I'm assuming you're here
to meet a gentleman anyway.

697
00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.000
I am here to meet
a gentleman. yes.

698
00:34:44.133 --> 00:34:47.300
Well. you know. it was. it was
really good seeing you.

699
00:34:47.433 --> 00:34:50.066
Yeah. You as well Jack.
you as well.

700
00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:05.166
Hey Brenda. Look. I don't
mean to bug you.

701
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.033
I. uh. you did say you were
meeting someone here. right?

702
00:35:09.166 --> 00:35:11.333
Yeah. They said they're
here already.

703
00:35:11.467 --> 00:35:13.233
Yeah. Same here.

704
00:35:13.367 --> 00:35:18.400
So. this person. you
didn't happen to meet them
on a dating app. did you?

705
00:35:19.834 --> 00:35:21.100
Organic Chemistry.

706
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.166
Finding Peace.

707
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.834
Oh. No no no no.
You're Looking to laugh?

708
00:35:28.967 --> 00:35:30.333
Alicia.

709
00:35:30.467 --> 00:35:33.567
I told her it was a bad idea
this online dating thing.

710
00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.066
Are you kidding me?

711
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.700
We gotta at least give her
credit for at least caring.

712
00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:37.900
I mean. it's just...

713
00:35:38.834 --> 00:35:40.300
Wow.

714
00:35:40.433 --> 00:35:42.333
Yeah. Hey. you haven't eaten
yet though. right?

715
00:35:42.467 --> 00:35:43.800
No. I haven't eaten.

716
00:35:43.934 --> 00:35:46.633
Neither have I and uh.
well you know.

717
00:35:46.767 --> 00:35:49.367
we're both hungry and
you look way too nice

718
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.533
to waste this dress.

719
00:35:51.667 --> 00:35:54.000
So. I've got a table.
how about dinner?

720
00:35:54.133 --> 00:35:54.734
I...

721
00:35:54.867 --> 00:35:55.734
Just dinner.

722
00:35:55.867 --> 00:35:56.900
Oh.

723
00:35:57.033 --> 00:35:58.467
Hmm?

724
00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.233
Okay. just dinner.
Just dinner.

725
00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:02.667
Dinner.

726
00:36:06.166 --> 00:36:06.767
Thank you.

727
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:07.900
How much is my half?

728
00:36:08.033 --> 00:36:09.400
Come on. Brenda.

729
00:36:09.533 --> 00:36:11.033
You know me well enough to know
I won't accept your money.

730
00:36:11.166 --> 00:36:13.433
I just want to make it clear
that this wasn't a date.

731
00:36:13.567 --> 00:36:15.066
Of course.

732
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.133
But can't a man show a beautiful
woman a little gratitude

733
00:36:17.266 --> 00:36:20.033
for a lovely evening?

734
00:36:20.166 --> 00:36:24.767
It was a lovely evening
and very unexpected.

735
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.433
Thank you for dinner. Jack.

736
00:36:26.567 --> 00:36:27.667
Yeah. you're welcome.

737
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.233
Woah. hey. woah. hold on.

738
00:36:32.166 --> 00:36:33.233
Uh-oh.

739
00:36:33.367 --> 00:36:34.800
Oh. come on. Just one
for old times' sake.

740
00:36:34.934 --> 00:36:35.700
One for old times?

741
00:36:35.834 --> 00:36:37.567
Yeah. Just one.

742
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.700
I can't believe you had us
battle that other couple.

743
00:36:53.834 --> 00:36:55.300
Oh please. you loved it.

744
00:36:55.433 --> 00:36:58.100
I did until you started to
break out that Soul Train line.

745
00:36:58.233 --> 00:36:59.233
Okay. maybe that was
a bit much.

746
00:36:59.367 --> 00:37:00.700
A bit?

747
00:37:01.734 --> 00:37:03.500
Oh. my gosh.

748
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.200
You remember when you took me
to see this movie?

749
00:37:07.333 --> 00:37:09.500
How could I forget?

750
00:37:09.633 --> 00:37:10.767
You wouldn't sleep
without the lights on.

751
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:11.867
Shh.

752
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.900
Oh. my goodness.

753
00:37:27.433 --> 00:37:29.867
Brenda! Is that you?

754
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.433
Uh. yeah Mom. it's me.

755
00:37:32.567 --> 00:37:34.767
I'm just. I got up early
to clean.

756
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.133
I'll be quiet.

757
00:37:36.266 --> 00:37:37.867
I'll be quiet so go back
and rest.

758
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.433
Get up. Get up.
Time to get up.

759
00:37:40.567 --> 00:37:42.166
- Hey. Hey. what?
- Get up.

760
00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.767
Can't let Mema see you here.
Get up.

761
00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:47.133
Okay. okay. okay. okay. okay.
Can I at least get some coffee?

762
00:37:47.266 --> 00:37:49.033
No. you can't get any coffee.
You have to go.

763
00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:50.233
Let me get your jacket.

764
00:37:50.834 --> 00:37:51.934
Millions of people
on the internet.

765
00:37:52.066 --> 00:37:53.934
only I would reconnect
with my ex-husband.

766
00:37:54.066 --> 00:37:56.133
Well. the irony is. it wasn't
that bad. was it?

767
00:37:56.266 --> 00:37:58.700
No. but you don't know me
anymore and I don't know you.

768
00:37:58.834 --> 00:38:00.500
Okay. But the familiarity
is nice.

769
00:38:00.633 --> 00:38:01.700
At least it is for me.

770
00:38:01.834 --> 00:38:02.834
Yeah. sure.

771
00:38:02.967 --> 00:38:04.266
You know you gotta admit.

772
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.333
I mean. it's funny how
our daughter unknowingly

773
00:38:06.467 --> 00:38:07.834
found a way to get us
back together.

774
00:38:07.967 --> 00:38:08.900
No. we're not back together

775
00:38:09.033 --> 00:38:11.033
and she can't know
about this. okay?

776
00:38:11.166 --> 00:38:12.600
Brenda. I didn't mean
it like that.

777
00:38:12.734 --> 00:38:15.200
Of course. my lips are sealed.
I'm not going to say anything.

778
00:38:15.333 --> 00:38:17.734
Okay. Let me uh. sneak out

779
00:38:17.867 --> 00:38:20.834
before your mother catches me
in my old house.

780
00:38:22.867 --> 00:38:23.967
It's nice to see you.

781
00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.200
Morning beautiful.

782
00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.100
Hey. Do you know. I called my
mom about four times last night

783
00:38:42.233 --> 00:38:43.667
and she's yet to return
my call?

784
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.066
Your mother's grown.

785
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.567
She probably stayed out later
than she's used to

786
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.000
and she's simply recovering.

787
00:38:50.133 --> 00:38:52.066
She hasn't been out in years.

788
00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.600
True I guess.

789
00:38:53.734 --> 00:38:55.900
Did you speak with Mema?

790
00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:57.767
Mema? No.

791
00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.834
No. I didn't want it to seem
like I was checking up on her.

792
00:39:00.967 --> 00:39:02.200
Which you are.

793
00:39:02.333 --> 00:39:03.500
Haha.

794
00:39:03.633 --> 00:39:05.700
What about Jack?
What's the latest with him?

795
00:39:05.834 --> 00:39:08.133
Well. um. he's been quiet too.

796
00:39:08.266 --> 00:39:11.567
But. um. we're meeting up for
a walk in the park so we'll see.

797
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:15.567
You know. that would actually
be nice for us to do sometime.

798
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.667
I... I know.

799
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.000
- Goodbye.
- Love you.

800
00:39:20.934 --> 00:39:23.900
Come on. come on. I got
good energy today.

801
00:39:24.033 --> 00:39:25.233
I'm sure.

802
00:39:25.367 --> 00:39:26.633
It must be all that hanging
out in these streets

803
00:39:26.767 --> 00:39:28.000
that's giving you life.

804
00:39:28.133 --> 00:39:29.333
The streets?

805
00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:31.700
My. have times changed. huh?

806
00:39:31.834 --> 00:39:33.033
Exactly.

807
00:39:33.166 --> 00:39:34.667
Because now you're acting
more like the teenager.

808
00:39:36.266 --> 00:39:37.967
What are you laughing at?

809
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.533
Who's the parent now?

810
00:39:39.667 --> 00:39:40.700
I'm just saying Dad.

811
00:39:40.834 --> 00:39:42.700
it's irresponsible not
to return my call.

812
00:39:42.834 --> 00:39:44.000
What. I told you
I had a date.

813
00:39:44.133 --> 00:39:45.367
Which you still haven't said
anything about.

814
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.233
I mean anything
could've happened.

815
00:39:47.367 --> 00:39:48.834
I was worried. Dad.

816
00:39:48.967 --> 00:39:50.734
Okay. okay. okay. okay.
All right. look.

817
00:39:50.867 --> 00:39:53.000
You're right. I'm sorry.
I apologize. okay?

818
00:39:53.133 --> 00:39:56.033
I should've called and let
you know I was fine.

819
00:39:56.166 --> 00:39:58.800
Okay. well thank you.

820
00:39:58.934 --> 00:40:00.900
But from the looks of it
seems like you had a good date.

821
00:40:01.033 --> 00:40:02.533
Yeah. I did.

822
00:40:02.667 --> 00:40:04.233
So?

823
00:40:04.367 --> 00:40:07.367
So uh. it was great.
She was great.

824
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.333
Okay. it feels like I'm pulling
teeth here.

825
00:40:09.467 --> 00:40:11.500
What did you guys do?
What does she look like?

826
00:40:11.633 --> 00:40:12.834
What is her name?

827
00:40:13.867 --> 00:40:14.834
Give me something.

828
00:40:14.967 --> 00:40:16.867
She's beautiful.
we ate. we danced.

829
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.300
we had a great time.

830
00:40:19.433 --> 00:40:22.734
Aw. look at you.
So when's the next date?

831
00:40:22.867 --> 00:40:24.200
You know. I don't know.

832
00:40:24.333 --> 00:40:25.367
We. uh. I think we both decided

833
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.233
that maybe there won't be
a next date.

834
00:40:28.367 --> 00:40:30.400
What? I'm confused.

835
00:40:30.533 --> 00:40:33.200
She's still trying
to get over an ex.

836
00:40:33.333 --> 00:40:34.133
I see.

837
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.300
Well just give it time.

838
00:40:36.433 --> 00:40:37.633
I mean. you know
you have a habit

839
00:40:37.767 --> 00:40:41.000
of being affectionately overbearing.

840
00:40:41.133 --> 00:40:43.567
Just let her know that you'll
wait as long as she needs.

841
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.967
You can still take it slow
and get to know someone. right?

842
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.700
Okay. Come on Miss Advice.

843
00:40:47.834 --> 00:40:50.133
Okay. okay take it slow
on the way back. okay?

844
00:40:50.266 --> 00:40:51.300
Come on.

845
00:40:51.433 --> 00:40:53.800
I can't really keep up
with you anymore.

846
00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.400
Come in.

847
00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.834
Hey.

848
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.734
Jack. what are you doing here?

849
00:41:02.867 --> 00:41:05.033
I see some things
haven't changed.

850
00:41:05.166 --> 00:41:07.233
Still burning the midnight
oil. huh?

851
00:41:07.367 --> 00:41:08.900
Well. it's not exactly midnight.

852
00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:11.767
Yeah. well it's not quite
office hours either.

853
00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:12.700
May I?

854
00:41:12.834 --> 00:41:13.767
Um...

855
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.367
Just. just. just hear me out.
Hold on.

856
00:41:19.033 --> 00:41:21.266
This morning when you said
that. you know.

857
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.400
we don't know each other.

858
00:41:22.533 --> 00:41:23.800
At first it bothered me
but. you know.

859
00:41:23.934 --> 00:41:25.800
I started thinking about it
and you're right.

860
00:41:25.934 --> 00:41:28.767
You're absolutely right.
We don't know each other.

861
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.467
I mean. I've certainly changed
since we were together

862
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.633
and I'm assuming you have
as well.

863
00:41:33.767 --> 00:41:34.967
Yes. I have.

864
00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:38.800
So. I was thinking. um.
why don't we.

865
00:41:38.934 --> 00:41:41.700
I don't know. spend some
time relearning each other?

866
00:41:41.834 --> 00:41:42.767
Relearning each other?

867
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.367
Okay. I don't even know
what that means.

868
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.300
Uh. last night really was great.
I'm just. I'm not interested.

869
00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.567
Oh. Sorry. Doctor Roberts.
Do you have a minute?

870
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.467
Yeah sure. of course.

871
00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.367
Just hoping you could
sign-off on this formation

872
00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.533
before I head out.

873
00:41:57.667 --> 00:41:59.033
Yeah. No problem.

874
00:42:03.066 --> 00:42:04.033
- It looks great.
- Yeah.

875
00:42:04.166 --> 00:42:05.133
Yeah. terrific.

876
00:42:05.266 --> 00:42:06.800
- I'm pretty happy with that.
- Great.

877
00:42:06.934 --> 00:42:10.000
Okay. I'll let you get back
to your meeting.

878
00:42:10.133 --> 00:42:11.700
- Okay. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

879
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.500
You know. you could've
introduced us.

880
00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:17.233
Yes. I could have.

881
00:42:18.567 --> 00:42:22.300
So. is that the reason why
you don't want to hear me out?

882
00:42:22.433 --> 00:42:23.867
No. Well. he's a colleague

883
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.500
and that's none
of your business.

884
00:42:25.633 --> 00:42:28.200
Okay. You're right.
You know what. back to us.

885
00:42:28.333 --> 00:42:31.533
See but there is no "us"
is the whole point. right?

886
00:42:31.667 --> 00:42:33.834
Why do you want to meet
so badly?

887
00:42:33.967 --> 00:42:35.433
I don't know.

888
00:42:35.567 --> 00:42:37.533
I just. I think there's a lot of
things we haven't spoken about.

889
00:42:37.667 --> 00:42:40.967
Well. because we haven't spoken
for a long time.

890
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.600
Do you want closure
or something?

891
00:42:42.734 --> 00:42:43.967
No. no. I wouldn't
call it closure.

892
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.266
A check-in?

893
00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.767
Look. last night was fun.
It was great.

894
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.367
It was special.

895
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.300
A moment is all I'm asking.

896
00:42:52.433 --> 00:42:54.166
Oh come on. I mean is it wrong
for two people

897
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.633
that's familiar with each other
to share a moment?

898
00:42:56.767 --> 00:42:57.800
It's not that simple.

899
00:42:57.934 --> 00:42:59.533
Well. it could be.

900
00:42:59.667 --> 00:43:02.867
Let's. let's just go out
as friends.

901
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.033
As friends?

902
00:43:04.166 --> 00:43:05.433
Friends. yeah. Acquaintances.

903
00:43:05.567 --> 00:43:08.233
Whatever you want to call it.
We'll keep it simple.

904
00:43:08.367 --> 00:43:09.867
You know. knowing
the two of us

905
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
I'll probably get on your nerves
before tomorrow anyway.

906
00:43:12.133 --> 00:43:13.734
So. this will all be irrelevant.

907
00:43:13.867 --> 00:43:16.367
It is probably true.

908
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.867
As friends.

909
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.767
That's it.

910
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:21.567
All right.

911
00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.367
Cool.

912
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.233
Okay friend.

913
00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:25.166
All right. I'll call you.

914
00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.767
Okay.

938
00:44:28.033 --> 00:44:31.066
I'm talking about that look
on your face.

939
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.967
Clearly this new friend of yours
has left an impression.

940
00:44:36.567 --> 00:44:38.333
You can brush me off
if you want.

941
00:44:38.467 --> 00:44:40.100
But I know that look.

942
00:44:40.233 --> 00:44:42.500
Shoot. I invented that look.

943
00:44:42.633 --> 00:44:44.166
Your father.
God rest his soul.

944
00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.834
would keep me smiling
just like that

945
00:44:46.967 --> 00:44:50.567
even when we weren't in
the same room together.

946
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:54.066
Actually. I haven't seen you
smile this much since...

947
00:44:56.934 --> 00:45:00.967
I'm happy for you.
Just take it easy.

948
00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:05.500
Your heart is fragile.
Always has been.

949
00:45:05.633 --> 00:45:10.834
And make sure whoever he is
is aware of that.

950
00:45:10.967 --> 00:45:11.967
Okay.

951
00:45:29.767 --> 00:45:31.233
You haven't asked me
to cover your shifts.

952
00:45:31.367 --> 00:45:33.467
Make any reservations?
What's up?

953
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.400
I think we're going
to keep it simple.

954
00:45:35.533 --> 00:45:37.800
Arnold mentioned something
about going to a cabin

955
00:45:37.934 --> 00:45:38.967
over the weekend.

956
00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.433
Whatever you decide
you might want

957
00:45:41.567 --> 00:45:43.633
to leave your phone at home
over the weekend.

958
00:45:43.767 --> 00:45:44.734
Don't think I haven't noticed

959
00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:46.033
you checking your phone
all morning.

960
00:45:46.166 --> 00:45:48.233
Your mom's going to call you
when she's ready.

961
00:45:48.367 --> 00:45:50.033
It's just so not like her.

962
00:45:50.166 --> 00:45:52.100
You know she cancelled
our weekly lunch date?

963
00:45:52.233 --> 00:45:54.533
Just relax. crazy.

964
00:45:54.667 --> 00:45:56.934
I'm sure Arnold would love
to enjoy his wife

965
00:45:57.066 --> 00:46:01.467
without parental interruptions
for once.

966
00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:02.967
Okay.

967
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.333
Easy big guy.

968
00:46:09.467 --> 00:46:12.667
Looks like someone needed
to relieve some stress.

969
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.433
What's up?

970
00:46:17.433 --> 00:46:20.266
My wife seems more interested

971
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.934
in her parents' love life
than planning our family.

972
00:46:23.066 --> 00:46:23.867
Your parents have
been honeymooning

973
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.367
since you've been born.

974
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:29.633
Alicia's broke up. what.
when she was 12 or 13?

975
00:46:29.767 --> 00:46:30.867
What's that got to do
with it?

976
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.834
As another divorce child
I can tell you.

977
00:46:33.967 --> 00:46:36.467
that wound doesn't heal quickly.

978
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.834
Give her some grace.

979
00:46:37.967 --> 00:46:40.100
And again. let her know
how you feel.

980
00:46:40.233 --> 00:46:41.934
If you tell her you want a child
and she doesn't.

981
00:46:42.066 --> 00:46:43.867
well that's a different issue.

982
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.633
But at least you know
where she stands

983
00:46:45.767 --> 00:46:47.734
instead of trying to guess.

984
00:46:48.834 --> 00:46:50.500
Let's get back to it. man.

985
00:46:50.633 --> 00:46:51.533
All right.

986
00:46:55.734 --> 00:46:57.967
Nice of you to check in
on me.

987
00:46:58.100 --> 00:46:59.500
And as for your mother.

988
00:46:59.633 --> 00:47:01.333
she's been running around here
with her head in the clouds.

989
00:47:01.467 --> 00:47:04.533
Yeah. Seems like this guy's
really got her going. huh?

990
00:47:04.667 --> 00:47:05.567
Mmmhmm.

991
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.533
Have you met him?

992
00:47:06.667 --> 00:47:08.033
No.

993
00:47:08.166 --> 00:47:10.934
She insists it's not serious
enough to bring him around.

994
00:47:11.066 --> 00:47:12.667
She just left here
not too long ago.

995
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.834
said they were headed out
to Selena's.

996
00:47:14.967 --> 00:47:17.367
I just told her not to have
her fancy tail out all night

997
00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.266
running in the streets.

998
00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.066
Anyway. how's that husband
of yours?

999
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.700
He's doing good.

1000
00:47:24.834 --> 00:47:28.900
Actually. I need to go home
to meet him now.

1001
00:47:29.033 --> 00:47:31.233
All right. well. I won't
hold you up.

1002
00:47:31.367 --> 00:47:33.500
And finish that tea
before you head out.

1003
00:47:33.633 --> 00:47:36.066
Yes. ma'am.

1004
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.533
And listen...

1005
00:47:39.133 --> 00:47:42.700
I know how much you care about
your mother and your father.

1006
00:47:42.834 --> 00:47:44.433
Ever since their divorce
you've been working

1007
00:47:44.567 --> 00:47:47.333
to put the pieces of the puzzle
back together.

1008
00:47:47.467 --> 00:47:52.734
But you have to realize
that's their puzzle.

1009
00:47:52.867 --> 00:47:56.200
Your joy lies in you.

1010
00:47:56.333 --> 00:48:00.166
Piecing together
your own journey.

1011
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.000
Hey there.

1012
00:48:14.133 --> 00:48:17.767
I thought we could start
this anniversary a little early.

1013
00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.834
Aww. I wish I had known.

1014
00:48:19.967 --> 00:48:23.233
I actually made us reservations
at Selena's tonight.

1015
00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:24.333
Oh.

1016
00:48:24.467 --> 00:48:25.967
I should've called.

1017
00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.767
How about we go there
and we can save

1018
00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.834
this amazing meal you planned
for tomorrow night?

1019
00:48:32.967 --> 00:48:36.900
Selena's on a weekday. huh?
Doesn't even sound like you.

1020
00:48:37.033 --> 00:48:41.633
Okay. As you know. my mom
has been short with me all week.

1021
00:48:41.767 --> 00:48:42.734
Of course.

1022
00:48:42.867 --> 00:48:43.567
I should've known it had
something to do

1023
00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:44.400
with one of your parents.

1024
00:48:44.533 --> 00:48:45.934
Look. hear me out.

1025
00:48:46.066 --> 00:48:48.734
So. I go to Mema's house to look
for her and she's not there.

1026
00:48:48.867 --> 00:48:50.400
So. Mema tells me that
she and this guy

1027
00:48:50.533 --> 00:48:53.133
are going to Selena's tonight.

1028
00:48:53.266 --> 00:48:56.400
So. you spent all day worrying
about your mom.

1029
00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:58.100
but now you want me to join in?

1030
00:48:58.233 --> 00:49:02.166
I mean. not just for that.
I figured we could...

1031
00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.800
- A romantic stakeout.
- Exactly. Sounds fun. right?

1032
00:49:05.934 --> 00:49:07.000
No. I'm going to pass.

1033
00:49:07.133 --> 00:49:08.300
Oh. come on.

1034
00:49:08.433 --> 00:49:11.066
We can eat and catch them
in the act. Win-win.

1035
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.867
For who?

1036
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.333
See. I don't get why
you're so obsessed

1037
00:49:14.467 --> 00:49:16.700
with what your mom
or your dad are doing.

1038
00:49:16.834 --> 00:49:19.500
As long as they're happy.
what's the issue?

1039
00:49:19.633 --> 00:49:21.300
Well. I knew you were going
to say that.

1040
00:49:21.433 --> 00:49:24.000
Maybe Kam will come with me.

1041
00:49:24.133 --> 00:49:25.667
I'm not going to be gone
that long. I promise.

1042
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.900
Look. I hope you find

1043
00:49:27.033 --> 00:49:29.667
whatever it is you're
actually looking for.

1044
00:49:31.533 --> 00:49:32.500
Babe.

1045
00:49:36.967 --> 00:49:39.000
Remember when you froze
in the middle of your speech

1046
00:49:39.133 --> 00:49:40.667
at your company reception?

1047
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.000
Oh. yeah.

1048
00:49:42.133 --> 00:49:43.200
And you had to get up
and finish my thank yous.

1049
00:49:43.333 --> 00:49:44.200
Mm-hmm.

1050
00:49:44.333 --> 00:49:45.400
I've always hated
public speaking

1051
00:49:45.533 --> 00:49:47.367
and you're so good at it.

1052
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:50.000
Always walking on the outside.
You're such a gentleman.

1053
00:49:50.133 --> 00:49:52.066
You know it used to frustrate
me when you'd be mad at me

1054
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.633
and wouldn't let me walk
on the outside lane.

1055
00:49:53.767 --> 00:49:54.233
It drove me crazy.

1056
00:49:54.367 --> 00:49:56.033
I know.

1057
00:49:56.166 --> 00:49:57.367
Woah. woah.

1058
00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.700
- What? What's the matter?
- We can't go in there.

1059
00:49:58.834 --> 00:49:59.533
Why not?

1060
00:49:59.667 --> 00:50:02.000
Look. Alicia and Kam.

1061
00:50:02.133 --> 00:50:03.533
Oh. no. no. We can't
go in there.

1062
00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:04.834
Okay. Don't worry.
I got a backup plan.

1063
00:50:04.967 --> 00:50:05.900
Okay.

1064
00:50:13.133 --> 00:50:15.834
Why do I feel this was
your plan all along?

1065
00:50:15.967 --> 00:50:17.367
Of course. it was.

1066
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:21.133
I staged Alicia catching us
going out to dinner together.

1067
00:50:21.266 --> 00:50:23.066
Do not give me
that much credit.

1068
00:50:25.133 --> 00:50:26.467
Speaking of which.

1069
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.633
what have you told her about
the person you're seeing?

1070
00:50:28.767 --> 00:50:29.567
Mm.

1071
00:50:30.967 --> 00:50:33.533
Just that she's the most
amazing woman in the world.

1072
00:50:33.667 --> 00:50:37.667
I'm serious. I've been trying
really hard to avoid her.

1073
00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.533
I just. I don't know
what to say.

1074
00:50:39.667 --> 00:50:40.834
I mean. we can't tell her
about this.

1075
00:50:40.967 --> 00:50:42.300
She'd be devastated.

1076
00:50:42.433 --> 00:50:45.166
What. that her parents
are back together?

1077
00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.400
Back together? I'm...

1078
00:50:46.533 --> 00:50:48.333
Brenda. You know
what I meant.

1079
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.000
Jack.

1080
00:50:52.934 --> 00:50:55.367
This last week has been
great fun.

1081
00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.133
Let's just call it what it is.
It's a fling.

1082
00:50:58.266 --> 00:50:59.700
A fling?

1083
00:50:59.834 --> 00:51:01.300
I wouldn't say that.

1084
00:51:01.433 --> 00:51:04.633
Well. outside of the laughs
and the romance.

1085
00:51:04.767 --> 00:51:06.967
what have we actually
discussed?

1086
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.100
Signing those divorce papers.

1087
00:51:08.233 --> 00:51:10.734
that was the worst day
of my life.

1088
00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:13.934
And sure we've been cordial all
these years for Alicia's sake.

1089
00:51:14.066 --> 00:51:16.233
but we never even
checked in on each other.

1090
00:51:16.367 --> 00:51:18.300
And for years I was
questioning myself.

1091
00:51:18.433 --> 00:51:19.433
What could I have
done differently?

1092
00:51:19.567 --> 00:51:20.900
What could you have
done differently?

1093
00:51:21.033 --> 00:51:22.967
I didn't even date.

1094
00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.900
I wasn't even interested
in a man in that way.

1095
00:51:26.033 --> 00:51:29.300
Then just as I'm about
to give love another shot

1096
00:51:29.433 --> 00:51:32.800
you magically appear and...

1097
00:51:32.934 --> 00:51:35.967
Okay. So. is that a bad thing?

1098
00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:39.033
I don't know.

1099
00:51:39.166 --> 00:51:43.934
I'm confused.
What happened to us?

1100
00:51:45.433 --> 00:51:48.066
Brenda. we were young.

1101
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.433
You know. we were both trying
to make a name for ourselves

1102
00:51:52.567 --> 00:51:56.200
in our respective fields and
somehow I think we just lost

1103
00:51:56.333 --> 00:52:00.800
a sense of our priorities
and started putting work first.

1104
00:52:00.934 --> 00:52:02.934
And then. you know. I started
having these weird feelings

1105
00:52:03.066 --> 00:52:08.800
like the more I tried to protect
you the less receptive you were.

1106
00:52:08.934 --> 00:52:10.300
Well. see that's the whole
thing. Jack.

1107
00:52:10.433 --> 00:52:12.033
Protect me from what?

1108
00:52:12.166 --> 00:52:15.600
I was looking for a partner.
I didn't need another father.

1109
00:52:15.734 --> 00:52:17.200
It was like... it was like
you didn't want me

1110
00:52:17.333 --> 00:52:18.333
to grow or something.

1111
00:52:18.467 --> 00:52:20.266
No. no. no.
That wasn't it at all.

1112
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:25.800
I just... I stopped knowing
how to make you happy.

1113
00:52:25.934 --> 00:52:26.967
And then I didn't feel needed.

1114
00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.133
You know. at some point
I didn't even know

1115
00:52:29.266 --> 00:52:31.133
where my place was
in your busy life.

1116
00:52:31.266 --> 00:52:34.433
Your place was
right by my side.

1117
00:52:34.567 --> 00:52:38.333
Championing me.
Just like I would you.

1118
00:52:38.467 --> 00:52:41.133
Right. right. right.
I get that now.

1119
00:52:41.266 --> 00:52:42.667
No. but you can't
get that now

1120
00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.600
because we're just now talking
about it.

1121
00:52:47.734 --> 00:52:48.967
I don't know.

1122
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.967
I just know that I don't want
to live in a bubble

1123
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:56.100
knowing that it will
eventually burst.

1124
00:52:56.233 --> 00:52:57.967
I'm going to go.
I need to go home.

1125
00:52:58.100 --> 00:52:58.767
Brenda.

1126
00:52:58.900 --> 00:52:59.934
No I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1127
00:53:00.133 --> 00:53:01.300
Brenda. Brenda.

1128
00:53:41.266 --> 00:53:45.133
Hey. I um. special ordered
you some breakfast

1129
00:53:45.266 --> 00:53:46.800
from Selena's last night.

1130
00:53:46.934 --> 00:53:48.934
It's just in the microwave
if you want to heat it up.

1131
00:53:49.066 --> 00:53:52.166
Thanks. But keeping it light
this morning.

1132
00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:53.900
Got a late night so I'm going
to grab something

1133
00:53:54.033 --> 00:53:55.767
on the way home from work.

1134
00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:58.500
There's leftovers from last
night if you want that later.

1135
00:54:03.266 --> 00:54:05.567
Look. I'm sorry
about last night.

1136
00:54:07.967 --> 00:54:09.000
Did you catch your mother?

1137
00:54:09.133 --> 00:54:12.266
No. no. She wasn't there.

1138
00:54:13.767 --> 00:54:15.333
I shouldn't have gone.

1139
00:54:18.033 --> 00:54:19.467
Arnold.

1140
00:54:20.767 --> 00:54:21.800
What. Alicia?

1141
00:54:21.934 --> 00:54:23.300
I know we need to talk.

1142
00:54:23.433 --> 00:54:27.000
so can you just please say
what you're thinking?

1143
00:54:27.133 --> 00:54:29.567
What I'm thinking.

1144
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.367
I don't know. to be honest
with you.

1145
00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:34.200
You don't get it.

1146
00:54:34.333 --> 00:54:37.633
I mean. your parents
are different...

1147
00:54:37.767 --> 00:54:41.834
Yeah. My parents have been
together for 40 years now.

1148
00:54:41.967 --> 00:54:43.834
Thank God.

1149
00:54:43.967 --> 00:54:46.533
And I couldn't imagine either
of them without each other.

1150
00:54:46.667 --> 00:54:51.066
Which is why I've tried to be
so patient and understanding.

1151
00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.166
But it feels like

1152
00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:58.166
if we aren't discussing
your parents in some capacity

1153
00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.934
then we aren't even speaking.

1154
00:55:01.066 --> 00:55:06.700
So. uh. last night after
enjoying my exquisite meal alone

1155
00:55:06.834 --> 00:55:09.934
I decided that maybe I'm...

1156
00:55:10.066 --> 00:55:12.233
maybe I've been doing
too much.

1157
00:55:12.367 --> 00:55:16.033
And maybe. maybe
we're not ready.

1158
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.500
Uh. ready for what?

1159
00:55:21.867 --> 00:55:23.133
Exactly.

1160
00:55:24.266 --> 00:55:25.533
I'll see you later.

1161
00:55:31.533 --> 00:55:33.567
Mr. MIA.

1162
00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:34.667
Hey.

1163
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.266
So. okay.

1164
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.633
I know it feels like I've been
ducking you lately.

1165
00:55:40.767 --> 00:55:43.767
but it's not that at all.
Just hear me out.

1166
00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:45.700
I'm listening.

1167
00:55:45.834 --> 00:55:51.100
So. the uh. the reason
I've been so reluctant

1168
00:55:51.233 --> 00:55:54.200
to introduce you to the woman
that I'm seeing is.

1169
00:55:54.333 --> 00:55:55.633
well. you know. how you always
get on me

1170
00:55:55.767 --> 00:55:59.300
about ending relationships
the minute they get serious?

1171
00:55:59.433 --> 00:56:01.800
I didn't want to. I didn't want
to go through that.

1172
00:56:01.934 --> 00:56:04.467
So. that's why you've been
running around in secret?

1173
00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.834
That and I'm trying
something new like you said.

1174
00:56:07.967 --> 00:56:11.433
I just don't want to disappoint
you or myself anymore.

1175
00:56:11.567 --> 00:56:12.867
You know?

1176
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.767
That means a lot. Dad.
But I am still your daughter.

1177
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:19.033
I mean. you can't block me
out completely.

1178
00:56:19.166 --> 00:56:21.033
We were always honest
with each other. all right?

1179
00:56:21.166 --> 00:56:23.166
Even. even the boyfriends
you didn't like.

1180
00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:24.934
I still let you meet them.

1181
00:56:26.266 --> 00:56:27.967
Yeah.

1182
00:56:29.667 --> 00:56:31.667
So um...

1183
00:56:33.567 --> 00:56:36.633
About the woman that I'm seeing.
she's...

1184
00:56:36.767 --> 00:56:39.300
Dad. No. no pressure.

1185
00:56:39.433 --> 00:56:41.800
You know. honestly you
coming here today

1186
00:56:41.934 --> 00:56:43.767
and just opening out about
why you've been so secretive.

1187
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:49.200
it's... it's
refreshing honestly.

1188
00:56:49.333 --> 00:56:50.767
You know I never
told you this

1189
00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:52.333
but I... I actually
signed up. Mom

1190
00:56:52.467 --> 00:56:53.800
on that dating site too

1191
00:56:53.934 --> 00:56:56.800
and she's been just as
tight-lipped as you.

1192
00:56:56.934 --> 00:57:00.533
And now it all makes sense.

1193
00:57:00.667 --> 00:57:02.233
It does?

1194
00:57:02.367 --> 00:57:03.333
Yeah.

1195
00:57:04.567 --> 00:57:06.600
When you and Mom got divorced
I was hurt.

1196
00:57:06.734 --> 00:57:10.166
I was... I was devastated.

1197
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:15.934
And I blamed you. blamed her.
blamed myself.

1198
00:57:16.066 --> 00:57:19.266
And I prayed every night
that you two would somehow

1199
00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.600
find your way back to each
other again.

1200
00:57:22.734 --> 00:57:25.066
And when that didn't happen

1201
00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.633
I prayed that you'd at least
both find love again.

1202
00:57:30.867 --> 00:57:35.033
I think I just. I think I just
need to back off.

1203
00:57:35.166 --> 00:57:38.734
So. when you are ready to share
this mystery woman with me

1204
00:57:38.867 --> 00:57:41.166
then I will be here.

1205
00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.667
Until then if she is as special
as you say she is.

1206
00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.934
then she's the one you should
be sharing that with.

1207
00:57:51.967 --> 00:57:53.333
Come on.

1208
00:57:57.667 --> 00:58:01.967
Okay. Just keep it short
and simple.

1209
00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.166
Just tell her how you feel?

1210
00:58:13.734 --> 00:58:14.600
Oh!

1211
00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:18.834
You got the beat.

1212
00:58:18.967 --> 00:58:20.200
Really Brenda?

1213
00:58:27.266 --> 00:58:28.266
I apologize.

1214
00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.934
No. There's nothing
to apologize for.

1215
00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.367
Jack.

1216
00:58:38.033 --> 00:58:39.567
What is the matter
with you?

1217
00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:41.166
Are you seriously mad
right now?

1218
00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.567
Look. Maybe I overreacted.

1219
00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:45.100
I just. it just looked like-

1220
00:58:45.233 --> 00:58:46.900
Looked like what?
I'm at work.

1221
00:58:47.033 --> 00:58:49.000
Well. I thought I was
interrupting something.

1222
00:58:49.133 --> 00:58:50.800
There's nothing for you
to interrupt.

1223
00:58:50.934 --> 00:58:53.166
I... you know what?

1224
00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:56.100
I don't want to defend myself
over nothing.

1225
00:58:56.233 --> 00:58:57.300
What does that mean?

1226
00:58:57.433 --> 00:58:58.333
It means that you're parading
around here

1227
00:58:58.467 --> 00:58:59.633
like I owe you something.

1228
00:58:59.767 --> 00:59:01.533
What are you talking about?
I never said that.

1229
00:59:01.667 --> 00:59:04.800
You don't have to say it.
Your actions say it.

1230
00:59:04.934 --> 00:59:07.800
Jack. our long walks
and cooking together

1231
00:59:07.934 --> 00:59:09.066
and all the stuff
we used to do.

1232
00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:12.834
it's been fun. but
we know this routine.

1233
00:59:12.967 --> 00:59:14.333
What are we really doing?

1234
00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:17.900
I don't know. Brenda.
Maybe dating.

1235
00:59:18.033 --> 00:59:19.667
Maybe trying to rediscover
what we had.

1236
00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.166
It's hard for me to casually
date someone

1237
00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:22.567
it took me years
to get over.

1238
00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:24.900
And rediscovering? We had
20 years to do that.

1239
00:59:25.033 --> 00:59:27.066
The only reason we're together
now is by accident.

1240
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.133
Are you saying this whole thing
is an accident?

1241
00:59:29.266 --> 00:59:30.667
No. I didn't mean it
to sound like that.

1242
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.066
That's not what I meant.
I just. I...

1243
00:59:35.633 --> 00:59:38.567
Maybe it's best that
we just both move on.

1244
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Gotcha. Yeah.

1245
00:59:47.133 --> 00:59:49.233
I wish the best for you.

1246
00:59:59.667 --> 01:00:00.734
up.

1247
01:00:00.867 --> 01:00:04.033
But since tomorrow's
our anniversary

1248
01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:07.233
I went ahead and I booked us
a room for the night.

1249
01:00:07.367 --> 01:00:08.633
It's last minute

1250
01:00:08.767 --> 01:00:11.266
but apparently it's one of those
couple getaway retreats.

1251
01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.433
Kam already agreed to take
all my late appointments

1252
01:00:13.567 --> 01:00:15.533
so I should be done early.

1253
01:00:17.867 --> 01:00:19.066
You hate it.

1254
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:26.033
No. I don't hate it. Alicia.
I um...

1255
01:00:26.166 --> 01:00:28.600
I'm just losing faith.

1256
01:00:28.734 --> 01:00:36.767
And uh. I want to believe you.
But. I guess. I guess we'll see.

1257
01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:41.467
I get that.
And you will see.

1258
01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.433
For now just find an excuse
to call out of work

1259
01:00:44.567 --> 01:00:47.266
and we can start packing.

1260
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.734
This is going to be a good thing
for us. babe.

1261
01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:52.867
Oh.

1262
01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.867
Answer it.

1263
01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.400
I won't be long. okay?

1264
01:01:00.433 --> 01:01:04.467
Hey Mom. What. what?
Slow down.

1265
01:01:08.934 --> 01:01:10.266
What?

1266
01:01:12.467 --> 01:01:17.400
I... I can um. I can try.
I can try and make it.

1267
01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.767
Everything okay?

1268
01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:33.200
Um. no. Actually. my mom
and her guy friend.

1269
01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:35.066
they called it off.

1270
01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.533
Go take care of your mother.

1271
01:01:39.667 --> 01:01:41.800
What? No. no babe.

1272
01:01:41.934 --> 01:01:43.633
We just said this weekend
is about us.

1273
01:01:43.767 --> 01:01:45.800
And it is. This weekend
it's you and me.

1274
01:01:45.934 --> 01:01:48.800
But we both know realistically
you can't be fully with me

1275
01:01:48.934 --> 01:01:51.767
if your mother's suffering so.

1276
01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:53.300
It's okay.

1277
01:01:53.433 --> 01:01:57.266
Okay. Um. I won't be long.
I promise.

1278
01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.500
For now maybe just start packing

1279
01:01:59.633 --> 01:02:02.500
and I will give you a call as
soon as I'm on my way back.

1280
01:02:02.633 --> 01:02:03.967
I love you.

1281
01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:15.834
Oh. Look at all those flavors.

1282
01:02:15.967 --> 01:02:17.100
Do you know what you're
going to have?

1283
01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.500
I'm good with cream
and sugar.

1284
01:02:18.633 --> 01:02:20.333
I mean you can keep
all those lattes and fraps

1285
01:02:20.467 --> 01:02:22.000
or whatever else
you call them.

1286
01:02:22.133 --> 01:02:26.233
Hey. You okay?
You seem a little off.

1287
01:02:26.367 --> 01:02:27.567
No. no. no. I'm fine.

1288
01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.867
I'm just. I just got a lot
on my mind. that's all.

1289
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.767
Well. hopefully I'm helping.

1290
01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:38.567
Relationships are such
a headache.

1291
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.867
Now. I remember why I stayed
single for so long.

1292
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.734
Well. it's been a minute
since you've been in the game.

1293
01:02:42.867 --> 01:02:44.100
but it hasn't changed much.

1294
01:02:44.233 --> 01:02:46.000
Well. it's your fault
I'm dating.

1295
01:02:46.133 --> 01:02:47.100
That's why it's my treat.

1296
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.367
Dad.

1297
01:02:53.166 --> 01:02:56.033
Princess. Brenda.

1298
01:02:56.166 --> 01:02:59.600
Um. what are you guys
doing here?

1299
01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:01.967
Oh. this is awkward.

1300
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:06.433
I know it's been a while but
you two can still speak. right?

1301
01:03:06.567 --> 01:03:08.066
Hi Jack. It's nice
to see you.

1302
01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.100
Um. listen. I uh...

1303
01:03:10.233 --> 01:03:12.800
Alicia. Hi.

1304
01:03:12.934 --> 01:03:16.133
So Jada is the mystery woman?

1305
01:03:16.266 --> 01:03:18.266
I'm the what?

1306
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.233
Mom. you okay?

1307
01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:25.400
- I gotta go.
- Mom?

1308
01:03:25.533 --> 01:03:26.900
Brenda. I can explain.

1309
01:03:28.934 --> 01:03:30.166
Explain what?

1310
01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:34.333
I'm... I'm confused. Dad.

1311
01:03:36.734 --> 01:03:41.967
Dad? Are you serious?

1312
01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.767
I was going to tell you
and I...

1313
01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:45.333
But you didn't.

1314
01:03:50.934 --> 01:03:54.166
Jack. what is going on?

1315
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:58.667
Um. Jada look. I'm sorry.

1316
01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.667
This. this was a mistake.
I'm so sorry.

1317
01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.333
You should've seen
the look on her face.

1318
01:04:15.467 --> 01:04:16.967
She was devastated.

1319
01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:21.300
And he was just standing there
looking silly.

1320
01:04:21.433 --> 01:04:23.900
We don't have
to force tomorrow.

1321
01:04:24.033 --> 01:04:25.066
I know your mom's...

1322
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.333
About that.

1323
01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.734
Remember how you said that
you knew that I wouldn't be able

1324
01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:36.467
to focus on us knowing that my
mom's going through something?

1325
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.333
Uh-huh.

1326
01:04:37.467 --> 01:04:41.800
Well. I kind of invited her.

1327
01:04:41.934 --> 01:04:44.000
Alicia.

1328
01:04:44.133 --> 01:04:47.633
Did you seriously invite your
mom on our romantic getaway?

1329
01:04:48.633 --> 01:04:50.834
Uh. it sounds bad when you say
it out loud. but yes.

1330
01:04:50.967 --> 01:04:53.000
She'll have her own room.

1331
01:04:53.133 --> 01:04:56.467
It's not like she'll be with us.

1332
01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:01.633
Arnold. she was so sad.
If you'd seen her...

1333
01:05:01.767 --> 01:05:03.600
Okay. Fine.

1334
01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:07.834
I... I'll just tell her
that she can't come.

1335
01:05:09.667 --> 01:05:10.767
You don't have anything to say?

1336
01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:12.700
Actually. I don't.

1337
01:05:12.834 --> 01:05:14.934
Nothing other than what
I've already been saying.

1338
01:05:15.066 --> 01:05:18.967
Is it cool that your mom
is joining us on our trip?

1339
01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.967
Of course it's not.

1340
01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:26.367
But last thing she needs is
another man rejecting her so.

1341
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.734
Well. you should probably
get that.

1342
01:05:30.867 --> 01:05:33.000
We both know it's for you.

1343
01:05:45.367 --> 01:05:47.567
Did I come at a bad time?

1344
01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:49.133
Can we please cut
the point of small talk?

1345
01:05:49.266 --> 01:05:50.367
You were seeing Mom
this whole time

1346
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.633
without telling me
just to go back to Jada.

1347
01:05:52.767 --> 01:05:53.867
No. No.

1348
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.767
That's not what happened.
at all.

1349
01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.233
Your mother actually
rejected me.

1350
01:05:59.367 --> 01:06:02.300
Jada just happened to call
at the right time and...

1351
01:06:02.433 --> 01:06:05.000
It was a mistake.

1352
01:06:05.133 --> 01:06:07.433
You know I saw your mother
with a guy from work

1353
01:06:07.567 --> 01:06:08.867
and you know. after she
turned me down...

1354
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.600
Guy from work.
Professor Staples?

1355
01:06:10.734 --> 01:06:13.467
I don't know what you saw
or thought you saw.

1356
01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.600
But I can promise you right now
Mom is not thinking about him.

1357
01:06:15.734 --> 01:06:17.033
Regardless. how...

1358
01:06:17.166 --> 01:06:19.667
How do you two run around
behind my back?

1359
01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.266
Look. we just decided
to keep it a secret

1360
01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.367
at least until we knew
what we were doing.

1361
01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.934
And then when you and I met up
and you told me how

1362
01:06:28.066 --> 01:06:30.667
the divorce affected you I
didn't know how to tell you.

1363
01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.500
Neither one of us did.

1364
01:06:32.633 --> 01:06:36.700
Princess. the last thing
we wanted to do was hurt you.

1365
01:06:36.834 --> 01:06:39.133
As bad as I feel you have
to understand.

1366
01:06:39.266 --> 01:06:41.633
your mother and I.
we're grown.

1367
01:06:41.767 --> 01:06:43.934
Yeah. We're going
to make mistakes.

1368
01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:45.433
But that's for us
to figure out.

1369
01:06:45.567 --> 01:06:46.633
Just like I have no right

1370
01:06:46.767 --> 01:06:49.000
being all up in you
and Arnold's business.

1371
01:06:49.133 --> 01:06:52.467
And I'm sorry you got involved
in this mess.

1372
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.266
The truth is I still love
your mother very much.

1373
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.967
As crazy as it might sound.
losing her this time around

1374
01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:01.133
just made me realize how much
I've been missing her all along.

1375
01:07:02.867 --> 01:07:04.900
As usual my overbearing
ways backfired

1376
01:07:05.033 --> 01:07:08.433
and. I guess. I came on
too strong for your mother.

1377
01:07:08.567 --> 01:07:11.567
You know. leave it up to me
to get in my own way.

1378
01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:12.834
Always trying to control things

1379
01:07:12.967 --> 01:07:16.100
that I should just leave
to the universe.

1380
01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:23.333
You have to know when to lead
and... and when to follow.

1381
01:07:23.467 --> 01:07:28.867
Yeah. I guess you're right.

1382
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Dad. Please don't reach out
to Mom if you're not serious.

1383
01:07:36.133 --> 01:07:39.967
I gotta go finish packing.
You can let yourself out.

1384
01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:50.567
Once again we're so honored
to be hosting you all.

1385
01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.767
This resort is truly
about lovers.

1386
01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:54.934
Or those simply looking

1387
01:07:55.066 --> 01:07:56.166
to disconnect from the world
for a while.

1388
01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.800
to give that system
a recharge.

1389
01:07:59.867 --> 01:08:01.834
So. who's ready to take
a look?

1390
01:08:03.867 --> 01:08:05.834
Who brought the stuffed animals
to the party?

1391
01:08:08.967 --> 01:08:10.633
Okay. let's go in.

1392
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.000
Here you two go.
So nice. right?

1393
01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:17.367
Wow. It's beautiful.

1394
01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.467
I agree. Please look around.

1395
01:08:21.333 --> 01:08:22.700
I can take you to your room.

1396
01:08:22.834 --> 01:08:24.033
Yeah.

1397
01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:25.567
Oh. don't forget about
the banquet dinner tonight

1398
01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.000
in the guest hall.

1399
01:08:27.133 --> 01:08:29.700
It will be free food and music.
You'll love the décor.

1400
01:08:29.834 --> 01:08:31.400
Sounds good.
Thank you.

1401
01:08:31.533 --> 01:08:32.734
This way.

1402
01:08:42.033 --> 01:08:43.767
Okay. I don't want to do this.

1403
01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:46.834
You were right.

1404
01:08:46.967 --> 01:08:50.300
Spending our anniversary
with my mom is not cool.

1405
01:08:50.433 --> 01:08:51.633
Regardless of the circumstances

1406
01:08:51.767 --> 01:08:52.967
I shouldn't have brought
her here.

1407
01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.367
Alicia. it's bigger than that.

1408
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.533
I know.

1409
01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:56.867
Do you?

1410
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.166
Because every time
you say that

1411
01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.433
your actions don't seem
to match.

1412
01:09:01.567 --> 01:09:04.200
I know I keep doing the same
thing over and over again.

1413
01:09:04.333 --> 01:09:05.867
It's like I can't stop.

1414
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:06.967
And I get it.

1415
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.934
I'm unintentionally
pushing you away.

1416
01:09:09.066 --> 01:09:10.333
It's working.

1417
01:09:12.333 --> 01:09:14.300
You asked me why
I've been obsessed

1418
01:09:14.433 --> 01:09:20.100
with my parents' happiness
and it finally hit me.

1419
01:09:20.233 --> 01:09:21.767
I'm scared.

1420
01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:23.300
Scared of what?

1421
01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:27.533
Living my own life.

1422
01:09:27.667 --> 01:09:28.934
After I spoke to my dad

1423
01:09:29.066 --> 01:09:32.633
I realized that I've been trying
to control everything.

1424
01:09:32.767 --> 01:09:34.600
Even the things
that I can't control.

1425
01:09:34.734 --> 01:09:38.533
And trying to solve their issues
because I figured well.

1426
01:09:38.667 --> 01:09:41.133
if I can find a way to keep them
happy then maybe our life

1427
01:09:41.266 --> 01:09:47.066
could have that fairy tale
ending that theirs didn't.

1428
01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.567
And now I'm spiraling
and I'm turning our marriage

1429
01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:53.433
into this self-fulfilling
prophecy

1430
01:09:53.567 --> 01:09:59.800
that could end in us one day
becoming strangers.

1431
01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:02.967
And I can't lose you.

1432
01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:06.633
I can't.

1433
01:10:06.767 --> 01:10:08.633
This is the closest
that I have felt to you

1434
01:10:08.767 --> 01:10:12.433
in I don't even know how long.

1435
01:10:12.567 --> 01:10:16.767
I miss us. I miss our intimacy.

1436
01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:20.433
There's so much
that I want for us.

1437
01:10:20.567 --> 01:10:24.066
Like growing our family?

1438
01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:28.066
I know. You've dropped your fair
share of subtle hints.

1439
01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.700
I see.

1440
01:10:32.266 --> 01:10:35.300
I want kids too.

1441
01:10:35.433 --> 01:10:39.200
I just. I have these flashbacks
of when my parents split.

1442
01:10:39.333 --> 01:10:44.100
and it was just like watching
a mountain crumble.

1443
01:10:44.233 --> 01:10:48.433
And I don't want that
for our child.

1444
01:10:48.567 --> 01:10:50.100
What if that's us?

1445
01:10:50.233 --> 01:10:55.433
What if it's not?
Where you see doubt. I see hope.

1446
01:10:55.567 --> 01:10:56.467
I've never doubted us

1447
01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.266
because I see the way
that my dad

1448
01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:02.100
still looks at my mom
to this day.

1449
01:11:02.233 --> 01:11:06.166
Yet I realize that that's
their story.

1450
01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:10.033
We are the authors
of our own story.

1451
01:11:10.166 --> 01:11:15.800
And I look forward to writing
each and every chapter with you.

1452
01:11:15.934 --> 01:11:22.600
All I ask is in our book.
we play the main characters.

1453
01:11:22.734 --> 01:11:24.433
Okay. Alicia?

1454
01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:34.433
I need my wife.
For me. For me. babe.

1455
01:11:56.767 --> 01:11:58.033
Hi.

1456
01:11:58.166 --> 01:12:00.767
Hi. Wow. this is nice.

1457
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.667
It's exactly the same
as your room.

1458
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.000
I just. I don't know if this was
such a good idea.

1459
01:12:07.133 --> 01:12:09.767
Are you kidding me?
This was a terrible idea.

1460
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.066
It was a terrible idea.

1461
01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:13.100
So bad.

1462
01:12:13.233 --> 01:12:15.333
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you
about me and your father.

1463
01:12:15.467 --> 01:12:17.200
Mom. You've apologized enough.

1464
01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.600
Look. I get it.

1465
01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:21.367
You two are grown and you didn't
want me to get involved.

1466
01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.600
Which you did anyway.
But that's fine.

1467
01:12:23.734 --> 01:12:24.900
I was trying to protect you.

1468
01:12:25.033 --> 01:12:26.166
I didn't need protection.

1469
01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.266
Yeah.

1470
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.600
I understand that more
than you know.

1471
01:12:31.734 --> 01:12:34.033
I didn't even realize
I still cared

1472
01:12:34.166 --> 01:12:37.200
until I saw him
with that other woman.

1473
01:12:37.333 --> 01:12:38.333
It didn't feel good. huh?

1474
01:12:38.467 --> 01:12:41.500
Nope. Not at all.

1475
01:12:41.633 --> 01:12:47.233
Well. maybe there's
still something there

1476
01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:49.000
for you two to work out.

1477
01:12:49.133 --> 01:12:52.867
Hmm. Been there done that.

1478
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.500
You know. not that you care.
but I spoke to Dad

1479
01:12:56.633 --> 01:13:01.467
and he told me that Jada didn't
mean anything to him.

1480
01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.567
That he was hurt and confused
when you rejected him.

1481
01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:09.633
No. but I didn't reject...

1482
01:13:09.767 --> 01:13:12.734
Wait. he said that?

1483
01:13:12.867 --> 01:13:14.967
Nope. Not going to do it.
Not this time.

1484
01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:18.500
I am staying out.
I'm not getting involved.

1485
01:13:18.633 --> 01:13:20.567
Learned my lesson.

1486
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.500
Anyway. what are you
wearing tonight?

1487
01:13:22.633 --> 01:13:25.834
I'm wearing my pajamas.
And I have a good book.

1488
01:13:25.967 --> 01:13:27.266
No. No. no. no.

1489
01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.066
No. that's not what's happening.

1490
01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.600
You're coming downstairs.

1491
01:13:30.734 --> 01:13:33.266
You're going to have dinner
with us and there'll be dancing.

1492
01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.100
Enjoy that.

1493
01:13:35.233 --> 01:13:35.900
Maybe.

1494
01:13:36.033 --> 01:13:36.834
Maybe. Sounds like a yes.

1495
01:13:36.967 --> 01:13:38.300
No. no. It's a maybe.

1496
01:13:38.433 --> 01:13:40.000
Wear your best dress.
I'll see you downstairs.

1497
01:13:40.133 --> 01:13:41.300
Love you!

1498
01:13:51.166 --> 01:13:54.467

No. She'll probably think

- Okay.

You told your dad we'd be here
hoping that he'd show up.

1514
01:14:43.734 --> 01:14:46.767
Maybe. But I also told him not
to show up

1515
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.867

1516

01:17:00.133 --> 01:17:02.500
Two piece black suit.
Matching black pumps.

1557
01:17:02.633 --> 01:17:04.600
Gold charm necklace that your
parents gave you for graduation.

1558
01:17:04.734 --> 01:17:06.133
Okay.

1559
01:17:06.266 --> 01:17:09.633
I don't like it when you make me
blush when I don't want to.

1560
01:17:09.767 --> 01:17:11.000
Is that such a bad thing?

1561
01:17:11.133 --> 01:17:13.100
If you can't keep it going.

1562
01:17:15.633 --> 01:17:18.000
That's fair.

1563
01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:20.300
So look. first of all I wanted
to apologize

1564
01:17:20.433 --> 01:17:22.734
for what happened
at the coffee shop.

1565
01:17:22.867 --> 01:17:27.100
It wasn't what you thought.
okay?

1566
01:17:27.233 --> 01:17:29.266
I know it's cliché to say
that you don't know

1567
01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:32.967
what you've got until it's gone.
but it's true.

1568
01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:34.633
You said we reconnected
by accident

1569
01:17:34.767 --> 01:17:36.633
and you're right. we did.

1570
01:17:36.767 --> 01:17:39.300
But that doesn't make
what I feel any less valid.

1571
01:17:39.433 --> 01:17:40.667
I want to be clear.

1572
01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.834
I didn't come here to romance
you for the weekend.

1573
01:17:45.533 --> 01:17:47.266
I want this for a lifetime.

1574
01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.567
Well. what would be different
this time around?

1575
01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.567
I mean the. the time
that we've spent together

1576
01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.734
is showing how much
we've grown.

1577
01:17:58.867 --> 01:18:00.367
Think about it.

1578
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:04.000
You weren't always checking in
at work and I even let you pay.

1579
01:18:04.133 --> 01:18:05.500
Well. once.

1580
01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:10.834
You know Brenda. I never
wanted that divorce.

1581
01:18:10.967 --> 01:18:13.233
In my mind it was always going
to work itself out

1582
01:18:13.367 --> 01:18:15.734
but it took me this time
around to realize

1583
01:18:15.867 --> 01:18:20.066
that it can't work itself out
if you stop working.

1584
01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.867
You're absolutely right
about that.

1585
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.333
Well. the beauty is
we have now.

1586
01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:27.500
Yeah.

1587
01:18:27.633 --> 01:18:31.900
Most people don't get a second
chance at their first love.

1588
01:18:32.033 --> 01:18:38.433
And you were
and are my only.

1589
01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.333
Look. I'll be the first
to admit I can be a lot.

1590
01:18:43.467 --> 01:18:46.233
But you gotta understand
that you pulling away.

1591
01:18:46.367 --> 01:18:47.200
it didn't help either.

1592
01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:50.166
I do understand that.

1593
01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:53.400
I should've told you
how I felt and I'm sorry.

1594
01:18:53.533 --> 01:18:56.000
It's. you know. most important
thing is we're here now

1595
01:18:56.133 --> 01:18:57.567
and we're talking.

1596
01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:00.367
And I mean I'm ready
to tell you

1597
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.433
and the whole world
how I feel about you.

1598
01:19:02.567 --> 01:19:04.133
Please.

1599
01:19:04.266 --> 01:19:05.367
What? You don't believe me?

1600
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:06.700
The whole world.

1601
01:19:06.834 --> 01:19:09.400
All right. Come on.
Come here.

1602
01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.800
Good evening everyone.

1603
01:19:23.934 --> 01:19:25.633
Sorry to interrupt.

1604
01:19:25.767 --> 01:19:29.266
I hope you're all
enjoying this. uh.

1605
01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:33.867
this. this. this beautiful
evening for lovers.

1606
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:40.066
But there's someone special
here tonight that's on my mind.

1607
01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:44.867
I'm sorry. can we get like
a light or something?

1608
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.066
Thank you.

1609
01:19:47.166 --> 01:19:48.734
Brenda Anne Roberts.

1610
01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.333
The love of my life.

1611
01:19:53.533 --> 01:19:58.033
Recently our daughter.
wave baby.

1612
01:19:58.166 --> 01:20:03.567
She reconnected us
after years of separation.

1613
01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:08.767
The thing I learned in
that time apart is that

1614
01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:12.200
true love always
finds its way home.

1615
01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:18.233
You know Brenda. in
rediscovering us I found myself.

1616
01:20:18.367 --> 01:20:21.367
Marrying you was the best
decision I ever made.

1617
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.100
Somehow. I allowed myself
to lose you

1618
01:20:23.233 --> 01:20:26.467
was the worst error ever.

1619
01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:31.367
You were growing and I didn't
know how to handle it.

1620
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:34.066
But I'm learning.

1621
01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:38.166
And I uh. excuse me...

1622
01:20:41.266 --> 01:20:45.533
I will never dim
your light again.

1623
01:20:46.433 --> 01:20:49.367
In fact. I promise to support
and encourage you

1624
01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:53.900
every step along the way
as we grow together.

1625
01:20:54.033 --> 01:20:57.767
You asked me what I wanted
the night that we reconnected

1626
01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:01.333
on our first date.

1627
01:21:01.467 --> 01:21:04.467
I just want to be
what you need.

1628
01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:09.133
You know? A partner
in this work.

1629
01:21:09.266 --> 01:21:11.767
Companion on this journey.

1630
01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:16.333
I want to be the man
that you always felt

1631
01:21:16.467 --> 01:21:18.600
that I had to protect you
to be.

1632
01:21:25.567 --> 01:21:26.967
Um...

1633
01:21:33.667 --> 01:21:36.633
Will you marry me.
Mrs. Roberts. again?

1634
01:21:42.567 --> 01:21:45.266
Of course I will.

We all love a happy ending
and all.

1638
01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.867
but didn't you just hear me
agree with my husband

1639
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.433
that we will be playing the main
characters in our own story.

1640
01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:20.734
So. yes. my parents
are remarried.

1641
01:22:20.867 --> 01:22:23.166
My dad gave my mom
space to grow.

1642
01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:26.767
which allowed her
to fully receive his love.

1643
01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:31.200
She made sure to make him more
of a priority and work less.

1644
01:22:31.333 --> 01:22:36.767
And thankfully for us. they are
no longer in my hair. and so...

1645
01:22:39.133 --> 01:22:43.500
We finally made time for us and
welcomed our beautiful baby girl

1646
01:22:43.633 --> 01:22:46.867
Elise Leanne Owens
to the world.

1647
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.200
- I love you.
- I love you.

I love you.
I love you too.

Stop. Let them have
their moment. Come on.

1650
01:22:54.333 --> 01:22:55.900
We love you too. Dad.

1651
01:22:56.033 --> 01:22:57.734
I'm just saying hi
to my granddaughter.

1652
01:22:57.867 --> 01:22:59.533
I know...

1653
01:23:00.767 --> 01:23:02.266
Is that going to be us
in 20 years?

1654
01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:02.967
To infinity.

1655
01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:04.800
Hm.

1656
01:23:04.934 --> 01:23:06.934
I am so happy I found my wife.

1657
01:23:07.066 --> 01:23:10.033
And I am so thankful you never
stopped searching.

1658
01:23:11.367 --> 01:23:14.900
Alicia: As you can see.
everyone started to grow.

1659
01:23:15.033 --> 01:23:17.300
Arnold and I rediscovered
our love

1660
01:23:17.433 --> 01:23:19.266
by getting back to the basics.

1661
01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.266
