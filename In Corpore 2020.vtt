- [Julia] So New York is a city.

14
00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:51.491
- [Sam] A lot of people?
- [Julia] A lot of people. yeah.

15
00:01:51.557 --> 00:01:54.730
- [Rose] Have you fucked most of them?
- [Gus] More than here?

16
00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:57.244
- [Julia] No. I have not.
- [Zara] Were you staying in Chelsea?

17
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.544
- No. the art exhibition I'm having
in five weeks is in Chelsea though.

18
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.976
Oh my god. thanks for remembering. you
would love it. I'd love to have you there.

19
00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:03.346
- I really want to go.

20
00:02:03.412 --> 00:02:05.226
- [Julia] I told Patrick
all about you guys.

21
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:09.418
If you wanted to come and see the
opening. or maybe we could Skype?

22
00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:11.324
- Square box.

23
00:02:11.672 --> 00:02:14.606
I'm sure Peter would love to have
us all there. I mean Patrick. sorry.

24
00:02:14.672 --> 00:02:16.807
- [Gus] It's Patrick Oldman.
- [Henri] Hey guys.

25
00:02:16.873 --> 00:02:19.577
- [Everyone] Hello! Hi! Henri!

26
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:24.101
- My god. You didn't
tell me you were coming!

27
00:02:25.494 --> 00:02:27.836
- I thought you were busy with stuff.
- I'm here.

28
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:32.611
- [Henri] I'm just going to get a drink. guys.
- [Julia] Yeah. where's your plus one?

29
00:02:33.037 --> 00:02:35.437
- [Henri] My Tinder date?
She couldn't make it tonight.

30
00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:38.139
- I haven't seen you in ages.

31
00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:40.222
- She's crazy.

32
00:02:40.288 --> 00:02:41.518
(laughing)

33
00:02:41.584 --> 00:02:43.934
- You're crazy. Mr. Singular.

34
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
- [Julia] What?
- [Rose] Oh. by the way (whistling).

35
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.488
- [Zara] Oh my god. thanks
for spoiling my surprise.

36
00:02:50.778 --> 00:02:53.796
- [Rose] I'm not that observant. but
don't you have purple eyeshadow on?

37
00:02:53.862 --> 00:02:55.632
- I always have purple eyeshadow on.

38
00:02:55.698 --> 00:02:58.454
- [Rose] And don't they have purple eyeshadow?
- [Julia] They do.

39
00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.896
- Oh my god. I've missed you.
- I've missed you too.

40
00:03:02.962 --> 00:03:05.116
- [Rose] G-string. I choose Henri.

41
00:03:05.182 --> 00:03:08.716
- What did you say? Why is he
single-o? His with Millie.

42
00:03:08.782 --> 00:03:14.127
- [Rose] She is no longer in our clan
and that causes celebration!

43
00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:17.619
- [Gus] We're already having a celebration Rose!
- [Rose] I know!

44
00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:21.725
- [Gus] This is Julia Return Day!

45
00:03:22.016 --> 00:03:23.579
- Ok. tonight...

46
00:03:24.292 --> 00:03:27.101
- [Julia] When did they break up?
- [Rose] Shouldn't you answer that question?

47
00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:28.701
- Do we have to have
this conversation here?

48
00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:31.797
- [Julia] Yeah we do. because you guys are shitting with me.
- [Rose] Welcome to the world!

49
00:03:31.863 --> 00:03:33.852
- [Rose] Surprise!
- [Henri] Can we chat? Sorry guys.

50
00:03:33.918 --> 00:03:36.727
- It's like your birthday
present. welcome to Melbourne.

51
00:03:36.793 --> 00:03:39.163
- Thank you I'm so happy.
I'm so happy. oh my god.

52
00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:41.976
- I was going to tell you.
- Yeah. but you didn't. Did you? And I asked you.

53
00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:43.997
I said hey. how's Millie
going? Is Millie good?

54
00:03:44.063 --> 00:03:46.697
- I was waiting until you got home.
- And you said she's well. she's fine.

55
00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:48.519
- It's just easier to say that on
Skype. Now you're home.

56
00:03:48.585 --> 00:03:50.067
- So you lied. you lied because what?

57
00:03:50.357 --> 00:03:51.769
- Come on!
- You lied about Patrick.

58
00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:53.737
- I didn't lie about him. I just didn't
tell you everything that happened.

59
00:03:53.803 --> 00:03:55.937
- I told you that we're together.
- Do they know about Vegas?

60
00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:57.937
- They don't fucking know about Vegas.
- Do your parents know?

61
00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:00.833
- No. and no one's going to find
out about that. Henri.

62
00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:02.965
- Until I'm ready to tell them.
- Fine.

63
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:05.565
- You're complaining all the time that
I'm too selfish and that I don't –

64
00:04:05.631 --> 00:04:08.751
- I just wanted to wait. I'm sorry. I
should have told you before. but it's...

65
00:04:09.017 --> 00:04:12.051
- It's just been messy.
- Well I'll tell my parents when I'm ready. alright?

66
00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:13.651
Because it's Dad 60th and that's the focus.

67
00:04:13.717 --> 00:04:15.879
And the focus is on him and my mum.
and make sure they're sane.

68
00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:18.265
And ok that I live away. and
all that kind of stuff. so...

69
00:04:18.507 --> 00:04:21.263
- I would appreciate it if you bide me some time.
- Ok.

70
00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.531
- Great.
- We're cool?

71
00:04:22.597 --> 00:04:24.119
- Yep!
- Let's have a good night.

72
00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:25.691
- [Julia] Drink up!

73
00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:30.409
So congratulations to Henri.

74
00:04:30.876 --> 00:04:32.876
- [Everyone] Henri! Henri!

75
00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:35.268
- [Julia] For being single.
and free from Millie.

76
00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:36.379
- [Henri] Single life!

77
00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:38.935
- Talking about freedom. Will Peter –

78
00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:44.442
Patrick let you ever step out
of your little square box? Will you?

79
00:04:44.508 --> 00:04:47.788
- Look. I told him about my choices
in life and he's open to that.

80
00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:50.160
And like you and I were doing
when we were together

81
00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:52.086
I'd let him know before I did something.

82
00:04:52.152 --> 00:04:54.686
- [Rose] Yeah. but Zara was cool.
- [Zara] And you didn't always let me know.

83
00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:56.566
- But I would text you if I
was out and I met a girl.

84
00:04:56.632 --> 00:04:58.894
- How long after you met him
did you sleep with him?

85
00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:02.345
- He actually wouldn't let me sleep
with him for about a week.

86
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:04.046
- [Henri] He wouldn't let her!
- [Zara] About a week!

87
00:05:04.112 --> 00:05:06.372
- [Julia] It was sexy!
- [Sam] Was he on his period?

88
00:05:06.836 --> 00:05:08.533
- Who are you? Who is this guy?

89
00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.727
(laughter)

90
00:05:09.793 --> 00:05:13.018
- And. if you were in an open space –

91
00:05:13.084 --> 00:05:15.166
- Oh. we didn't have sex in the gallery.

92
00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:16.319
(laughter)

93
00:05:16.385 --> 00:05:17.645
- [Rose] With your eyes!

94
00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:19.685
G-string and Just Sam?

95
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:23.268
Would you ask each other or tell each
other if you wanted to fuck somebody else?

96
00:05:23.334 --> 00:05:26.552
Or would you just not want to know?

97
00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.958
- Oh no. we have done
that and it doesn't work.

98
00:05:29.024 --> 00:05:31.158
- That doesn't work?
- It doesn't work for us.

99
00:05:31.224 --> 00:05:33.226
- And sometimes people don't
actually want to fuck other people.

100
00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:37.068
- [Julia] It worked fine for us.
- [Sam] Zara's face doesn't say it worked fine for us.

101
00:05:37.134 --> 00:05:39.101
- [Zara] I don't really want to talk about it.
- [Gus] Yeah. worked fine for you!

102
00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:41.925
- [Julia] Who are you?
- [Gus] He's observant.

103
00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:43.491
- I don't want to...

104
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.787
- [Zara] Yeah. I really don't really want to do this.
- [Rose] Julia. you really need to just tell me this?

105
00:05:46.853 --> 00:05:48.166
- [Rose] J!

106
00:05:48.232 --> 00:05:50.392
- [Julia] Come on. it's your
turn to kiss someone. go!

107
00:05:50.838 --> 00:05:52.071
- [Henri] What?
- [Julia] Yeah.

108
00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:54.236
- [Rose] J?
- [Julia] What?

109
00:05:54.302 --> 00:05:56.909
Since when have you wanted
to just fuck one person?

110
00:05:56.975 --> 00:05:59.644
Because since I've known you

111
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.922
that has been the most
fearful thing in your existence.

Patrick and I have been...

125
00:07:27.329 --> 00:07:31.129
Really happy together and I want
you to know that we actually

126
00:07:31.977 --> 00:07:36.377
decided to commit to each other
in a really beautiful way and

127
00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:39.535
he's excited to meet you
and be able to call you guys...

128
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.206
He's excited to meet you
and is excited to be able...

129
00:07:46.997 --> 00:07:50.835
We went to Vegas and
thought it would be fun.

130
00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:54.566
To...

131
00:07:55.552 --> 00:07:57.552
God damn it.

132
00:07:58.223 --> 00:08:00.531
I want you guys to know.

133
00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:02.995
That...

134
00:08:03.571 --> 00:08:05.871
You have a son in law.

135
00:08:07.481 --> 00:08:08.597
Whoʼs...

136
00:08:11.523 --> 00:08:13.431
I love him.

137
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:16.052
I really love him.

138
00:08:16.574 --> 00:08:17.706
(door opening)

139
00:08:17.772 --> 00:08:19.366
- [Tim] Jules?
- [Julia] Yeah?

140
00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:20.432
- Lunch is ready.

141
00:08:20.748 --> 00:08:22.238
- Yeah. I'm coming.

142
00:08:26.702 --> 00:08:29.710
(Footsteps)

143
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.134
- [Anita] Sweetheart. you're
playing with clay at the dinner table.

144
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.426
- [Julia] Well. I actually
wanted to talk about that

145
00:08:35.492 --> 00:08:38.261
and the fact that I'm excited to share –

146
00:08:38.327 --> 00:08:40.104
- [Anita] That's disgusting!
- [Julia] What?

147
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:41.736
- [Tim] I think you need to go and wash.

148
00:08:41.802 --> 00:08:44.514
- [Julia] I will! I want to just finish this piece.
- [Anita] She gets that from you.

149
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.443
- [Anita] Not from my side.
- [Julia] It's about to end!

150
00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:48.943
I just need to finish it.
it's nearly done I promise.

151
00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:51.268
I really want to show you
more of the work I'm doing.

152
00:08:51.334 --> 00:08:52.352
- [Anita] Darling?
- [Julia] Yeah?

153
00:08:52.418 --> 00:08:53.954
- Not at the table. please.
- [Julia] Ma. it's –

154
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.468
- Not at the dinner table. please.

155
00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:57.908
- [Julia] Okay. okay. okay. I'll stop.

156
00:08:57.974 --> 00:09:02.093
I just wanted to say that I would like
us to Skype more often together and...

157
00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:04.793
- [Tim] Of course.
- [Julia] I'm having this big exhibition in New York.

158
00:09:04.859 --> 00:09:06.067
- [Anita] You're not staying longer?

159
00:09:06.133 --> 00:09:07.382
- [Julia] Here?
[Anita] Yeah.

160
00:09:07.448 --> 00:09:08.976
- [Julia] Yeah. I'm
here for Dad's birthday.

161
00:09:09.042 --> 00:09:11.102
- [Anita] Okay. I hoped that
you'd stay a bit longer than that.

162
00:09:11.168 --> 00:09:13.218
- [Tim] We thought that you
would stay a bit longer than that.

163
00:09:13.284 --> 00:09:15.884
- [Anita] Anyway...
- [Tim] A couple of weeks. three weeks maybe?

164
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.006
- There's some really handsome
young men coming to dad's birthday party.

165
00:09:20.412 --> 00:09:21.904
(doorbell)

166
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.426
- [Julia] Did you invite someone?
- [Tim] No. I don't know.

167
00:09:24.492 --> 00:09:27.086
- [Julia] Who is that? Dad!
- [Tim] I don't know. I'll have a look.

168
00:09:27.152 --> 00:09:29.590
- [Julia] I can't do sculpture but dad's
allowed to have business meetings at lunch.

169
00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:30.795
Mum. this is ridiculous.

170
00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:33.221
- [Anita] They can probably smell
the roast down the street.

171
00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:38.310
- Anyway playing with clay at the table is grotty.
- [Julia] All right. I'll clean the glass.

172
00:09:38.376 --> 00:09:40.512
I just don't want it to dry out.
You know what I mean.

173
00:09:41.169 --> 00:09:43.115
- Look what I found at the door.

174
00:09:43.181 --> 00:09:46.181
- [Henri] Surprise!
- [Anita] What a lovely surprise.

175
00:09:47.457 --> 00:09:49.768
- [Henri] Hope you like Cab Sav.
- [Anita] I was just talking about...

176
00:09:49.834 --> 00:09:51.624
- [Julia] What the fuck are you doing here?
- [Anita]... our handsome friend.

177
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.424
- [Henri] How are you?
- [Julia] What's he doing here?

178
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.526
- [Tim] I don't know. I
know nothing about this.

179
00:09:55.592 --> 00:09:57.766
- Are you having business
meetings when I'm not around?

180
00:09:57.832 --> 00:09:59.832
- [Henri] Long time no see!

181
00:10:01.418 --> 00:10:04.003
- [Julia] What are you doing here?
- [Henri] Your mum invited me.

182
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:05.559
- What the fuck?

183
00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:07.277
- She called me.

184
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:09.691
- [Julia] That's amazing.

185
00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:13.580
- [Anita] Darling. do you
want to look after everyone?

186
00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:16.646
- I'm going to go back to making my sculpture.
- [Henri] Where should I sit?

187
00:10:17.268 --> 00:10:19.602
- [Anita] To having our
beautiful daughter back.

188
00:10:19.668 --> 00:10:21.020
- [Henri] Yes. you must be happy.

189
00:10:21.086 --> 00:10:25.519
- [Anita] To having a handsome young visitor. And
of course to your birthday tomorrow. Let's toast.

190
00:10:25.585 --> 00:10:27.265
- [Julia] Yeah go dad!
[Everyone cheers]

191
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:28.393
- [Tim] Eye contact!

192
00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:30.579
- [Julia] Eye contact. yeah.
yeah. yeah. Eye contact!

193
00:10:32.352 --> 00:10:35.039
- [Tim] Henri. how do you
happen to be here today?

194
00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:36.363
- [Julia] Yeah. Mum.

195
00:10:36.429 --> 00:10:39.073
- Well I got a phone call. well. Iʼll
let you explain the story. Anita.

196
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:42.811
- [Anita] Okay. Well could I have a
60th and not have Henri here?

197
00:10:42.877 --> 00:10:45.918
Would it be your true birthday?
He's part of the family.

198
00:10:46.266 --> 00:10:47.746
- [Julia] Like a little brother.

199
00:10:50.876 --> 00:10:53.529
- [Julia] Dad. how many brussel sprouts do you want?
- [Tim] Two. thanks.

200
00:10:53.595 --> 00:10:55.692
- Two. alright. Do you want carrots?

201
00:10:56.272 --> 00:10:57.278
Oh shoot!

202
00:10:57.344 --> 00:10:59.126
- [Henri] What a catch!

203
00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:01.912
- [Julia] I think my dad wants your germs.
- [Henri] Ten second rule.

204
00:11:02.103 --> 00:11:04.000
- [Tim] So. Patrick. So
what's happening there?

205
00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:06.863
- Well. we're really happy together.
We've been living together about

206
00:11:06.929 --> 00:11:08.153
twelve months now.

207
00:11:08.219 --> 00:11:09.469
Which has been really special.

208
00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:10.715
- [Tim] What does he actually do?

209
00:11:10.781 --> 00:11:13.547
- He's the art critic for
The New York Times.

210
00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:16.247
- [Tim] So he's a critic. He doesn't do.

211
00:11:16.313 --> 00:11:18.615
he critiques other people's doing.
- [Julia] I'm glad you mentioned it.

212
00:11:18.681 --> 00:11:20.015
Okay. so Henri knows about this.

213
00:11:20.081 --> 00:11:21.783
So he does sometimes do.

214
00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:25.918
He sometimes dabbles in some
charcoal work and some sketches.

215
00:11:26.155 --> 00:11:28.431
So he wanted you both to have this.

216
00:11:28.497 --> 00:11:31.697
It's a portrait of me when we
first met in our first month.

217
00:11:33.251 --> 00:11:35.977
It's on the writing paper
because he's a critic. right.

218
00:11:36.043 --> 00:11:39.109
So he wanted to share the writing of time.

219
00:11:39.175 --> 00:11:41.009
- the body lines.
- [Anita] It doesn't look a lot like you.

220
00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:42.473
- [Henri] Yeah. I was going to say that.

221
00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:44.609
- Mind you. he's a critic. not an artist.

222
00:11:44.675 --> 00:11:45.976
- [Julia] Youʼre kidding. really?

223
00:11:46.042 --> 00:11:48.002
- [Henri] I don't think
it really looks like you.

224
00:11:48.292 --> 00:11:50.612
- [Anita] Yeah. it doesn't.
- [Tim] The eyes maybe. but...

225
00:11:51.314 --> 00:11:53.417
- [Julia] Anyway. so it's
for you dad. yeah. thanks.

226
00:11:53.483 --> 00:11:58.001
- [Tim] The only thing I'm a bit concerned
about is the age difference.

227
00:11:59.059 --> 00:12:01.087
Because he's quite a bit older than you.

228
00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:02.806
- [Anita] A bit?

229
00:12:02.872 --> 00:12:06.014
- [Tim] I mean is this a daddy complex or something?
- [Julia] No.

230
00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:11.000
- [Julia] Yeah. I think we're on a mental –
- [Tim] What's the age difference?

231
00:12:11.649 --> 00:12:12.999
- [Julia] It's a bit

232
00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.934
- So youʼre like the handbag. are you?

233
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.040
- [Julia] I'm not the
handbag Mum. that's horrible.

234
00:12:17.577 --> 00:12:21.698
That's horrible! He really wants to meet you
guys. he's nice. can you tell them how kind he is.

235
00:12:21.764 --> 00:12:24.453
- [Henri] Yeah. I've seen him on Skype.
He seems like a really nice guy.

236
00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:26.056
- [Julia] That's so degrading.

237
00:12:26.376 --> 00:12:29.934
What do you take me for? Mum. Iʼm my own
artist. I'm making work. I'm selling my stuff.

238
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.134
- [Anita] So you don't need him.

239
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.424
- I don't need him. I'm choosing to be with
him because it's great to be with him.

240
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:38.078
He's really supportive. he understands what I
do. I don't have to justify myself every day.

241
00:12:38.144 --> 00:12:40.508
- [Henri] He's been helping
Julia a lot in the last six months.

242
00:12:40.574 --> 00:12:44.508
Yeah and it's not like being here where I'm
always having to justify what I do to family.

243
00:12:44.574 --> 00:12:46.574
to your brothers always asking. come on!

244
00:12:46.806 --> 00:12:49.340
- [Anita] I've never known
you to need help with your art.

245
00:12:49.406 --> 00:12:53.279
- I don't need help with my art. I'm
feeling passionate and focused in my art.

246
00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:59.402
I'm having an exhibition of my own.
big sculpt pieces in Chelsea. I'm –

247
00:12:59.468 --> 00:13:01.161
- [Anita] That part I'm happy about.
- [Julia] Great.

248
00:13:01.227 --> 00:13:03.238
- [Anita] I'm not happy about
you living there. I prefer you living –

249
00:13:03.304 --> 00:13:06.452
- [Julia] I know –
- [Tim] We have been very supportive of you

250
00:13:06.518 --> 00:13:10.158
- [Julia] Yeah. I know and I am grateful for that.
- [Tim] going away and pursuing your art.

251
00:13:10.311 --> 00:13:13.431
I mean if I had my way. you would
have gone into financial law.

252
00:13:13.497 --> 00:13:15.235
- Dad. I had a scholarship for art.

253
00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:18.520
- [Tim] I know.
- [Julia] I got a scholarship to go America and study and bring –

254
00:13:18.586 --> 00:13:21.510
- You're one subject off a law degree.

255
00:13:21.576 --> 00:13:24.451
One subject off a law
degree. It's still sitting there.

256
00:13:24.517 --> 00:13:26.535
- And I can go back to that if I want to.

257
00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:29.085
- If.
- I am doing really well.

258
00:13:29.151 --> 00:13:32.419
- You always said that you
were going to move back here.

259
00:13:32.709 --> 00:13:35.100
New York was only supposed to be temporary.

260
00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:37.828
- I wasn't getting any attention here.

261
00:13:39.042 --> 00:13:41.042
No one took me seriously.

262
00:13:41.108 --> 00:13:43.342
And there I am making work every day.

263
00:13:43.408 --> 00:13:46.492
- [Henri] Do you think Patrick would
come back over here and live here?

264
00:13:46.558 --> 00:13:48.702
- [Julia] Ah. maybe. Yeah. sure.

265
00:13:48.768 --> 00:13:53.978
I mean he loves me. He wants me to be happy. he
wants to be where I am and we'd make that work.

266
00:13:54.044 --> 00:13:55.478
- [Tim] How serious is it?

267
00:13:55.544 --> 00:13:56.344
- Um.

268
00:13:58.215 --> 00:13:59.389
It's pretty serious.

269
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:04.427
Yeah. we took a trip to Vegas. actually.

270
00:14:04.946 --> 00:14:08.076
- [Anita] We should go. Why don't we
go over there? That would be great.

271
00:14:08.142 --> 00:14:10.576
We could go on holiday.
Would you like us to come?

272
00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:13.576
- [Julia] It would be amazing to
have you guys there for the art exhibition.

273
00:14:13.642 --> 00:14:16.914
- Or maybe we can come to the exhibition. and
fly to vegas on the way back. or something?

274
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.810
- Would you like to join us?

275
00:14:18.876 --> 00:14:20.410
- [Henri] Yeah. I'd love to go to Vegas.

276
00:14:20.476 --> 00:14:25.376
- [Anita] Would you mind if it was just us? And
we left Patrick at home to have quiet family...

277
00:14:25.724 --> 00:14:29.924
- [Julia] I think we could totally have family
time. the three of us together. but I. ah -

278
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.334
- No. the four because
Henri could join us -

279
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.440
- [Julia] Well. Vegas is actually a special
spot for Patrick and I. We got...

280
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.210
We got married there.

281
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:39.727
- [Tim] I'm sorry?

282
00:14:39.793 --> 00:14:42.793
-Yeah. I'm married. You have a son-in-law.

283
00:14:44.453 --> 00:14:46.453
-When did you get married?

284
00:14:47.308 --> 00:14:48.608
-Did you know this. Henri?

285
00:14:48.793 --> 00:14:51.153
-Yes. I mean I shared it with Henri.

286
00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:53.101
-Yes. Julia told me.

287
00:14:54.209 --> 00:14:56.609
- [Anita] When did she tell you?

288
00:14:57.104 --> 00:14:58.938
- About six months ago.

289
00:14:59.004 --> 00:15:02.722
- [Anita] So everybody knew it except for
us! And they've been married for six months!

290
00:15:02.954 --> 00:15:04.960
- Fuck you! You said...

291
00:15:05.726 --> 00:15:10.258
- Our only daughter gets married and we don't
know about it and we're not even invited.

292
00:15:10.324 --> 00:15:13.924
- [Julia] No. we want... we wanted
it to be something special -

293
00:15:14.209 --> 00:15:18.048
- [Anita] It would have been something special
if you got married and invited your parents.

294
00:15:18.343 --> 00:15:19.711
- [Julia] It just happened. Mum.

295
00:15:19.943 --> 00:15:21.047
- No. it doesn't just happen.

296
00:15:21.113 --> 00:15:24.543
- [Julia] It does just happen. It was love.
We fell in love and it was amazing.

297
00:15:24.609 --> 00:15:26.644
so we took a flight down there. okay.
- [Anita] You're not a little child.

298
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.424
-I'm not a child. You're right. I went with my
gut. it made sense. it's what I'm here to do.

299
00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.260
- [Anita] And. your gut is to what?
Our only daughter!

300
00:15:33.745 --> 00:15:36.345
- You guys don't own me. Come on!

301
00:15:36.983 --> 00:15:40.045
[Julia] I want to be able to discuss this with you.
For you to be happy about the choices I've made.

302
00:15:40.111 --> 00:15:44.111
You guys had a similar problem when you
first got together. like it was challenging

303
00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:47.777
at the time to be from different universes. different cultures.
- [Anita] We had our parents at our wedding.

304
00:15:47.843 --> 00:15:49.634
- [Julia] Mum. this is not fair.

305
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.260
I really wanted to share -
- [Anita] You're right. it's not fair.

306
00:15:54.211 --> 00:15:55.715
- [Julia] What the fuck!

307
00:15:55.781 --> 00:15:57.899
Why can we never have
a discussion in this place?

308
00:15:57.965 --> 00:15:59.412
Did you get married by Elvis or what?

309
00:15:59.478 --> 00:16:01.110
- Oh. fuck you!

310
00:16:02.517 --> 00:16:05.677
It's really great to see you. Henri. thanks
for coming. Really great. Thank you.

311
00:16:10.744 --> 00:16:13.244
(sad music)

312
00:16:14.594 --> 00:16:15.740
(knocking)

313
00:16:28.233 --> 00:16:29.239
- Hi.

314
00:16:32.733 --> 00:16:34.265
Got you something to cheer you up.

315
00:16:41.607 --> 00:16:45.261
- It was my thing to tell them and you had no
right letting them know itʼs been six months.

316
00:16:45.327 --> 00:16:47.807
I don't understand what the fuck you
are you doing here. so...

317
00:16:48.499 --> 00:16:50.209
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

318
00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:53.451
I'm really sorry.

319
00:16:58.367 --> 00:17:00.417
I just didn't expect that would happen.

320
00:17:00.483 --> 00:17:04.083
- Yeah well. I did. Today
was my one day to tell them.

321
00:17:04.877 --> 00:17:08.177
My one day to like deal with all this shit
before the birthday. before they

322
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:12.231
throw a tantrum. have a hissy fit and...

323
00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:17.120
I don't get it.

324
00:17:17.186 --> 00:17:20.302
I don't get why you would
feel entitled to show up.

325
00:17:20.908 --> 00:17:22.761
- I didn't show – I didn't know.

326
00:17:22.827 --> 00:17:26.572
It was just so hard in the moment.
your parents were asking me to –

327
00:17:26.638 --> 00:17:29.314
- When did she ask you to come over?
When did that happen?

328
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:30.972
- It was only a few days ago.

329
00:17:31.427 --> 00:17:33.561
Why would I say – Of
course I would say yes.

330
00:17:33.627 --> 00:17:36.185
- You have a life. don't you?
Don't you do other things. Henri?

331
00:17:36.677 --> 00:17:38.209
- I wasn't doing anything tonight.

332
00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:39.849
(Julia sighs)

333
00:17:40.545 --> 00:17:44.345
So thought I'd come over for lunch
and hang out and...

334
00:17:46.645 --> 00:17:47.935
Have cake.

335
00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:55.819
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

336
00:17:57.617 --> 00:17:59.446
(laughing)

337
00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.664
- [Julia] Fuck you. no fucking way.

338
00:18:03.109 --> 00:18:05.387
That is for you gate crashing –

339
00:18:05.827 --> 00:18:08.363
- Your party?
- My coming out to my parents.

340
00:18:10.042 --> 00:18:12.116
- [Henri] Lick it off.
- [Julia] No fucking way.

341
00:18:12.545 --> 00:18:13.879
- [Henri] Yum. that tastes so good.

342
00:18:13.945 --> 00:18:15.232
- Good.

343
00:18:19.413 --> 00:18:20.819
Do you not like Patrick?

344
00:18:22.171 --> 00:18:23.405
- [Henri] I didn't say I don't like him.

345
00:18:23.471 --> 00:18:24.645
- You didn't seem to really

346
00:18:25.073 --> 00:18:28.007
describe him to my parents the way
you said you care about him.

347
00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:31.373
- I said he was nice. I
said he's helping you out.

348
00:18:31.975 --> 00:18:33.599
- When you had Skyped –
- Did you hear me say that?

349
00:18:33.665 --> 00:18:36.665
- Yeah. When you guys
are together on the screen.

350
00:18:37.235 --> 00:18:39.522
he'll leave. you're like "Heʼs so great."

351
00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.450
Where was that Henri?

352
00:18:42.711 --> 00:18:44.005
- It was hard with your parents.

353
00:18:44.071 --> 00:18:46.711
They didn't seem to be a fan.
- They need to hear that he is good.

354
00:18:46.777 --> 00:18:48.437
- Well. it was really awkward.

355
00:18:49.365 --> 00:18:51.141
- Alright.
- What now?

356
00:18:51.425 --> 00:18:52.588
- What now?

357
00:18:53.251 --> 00:18:55.420
Mum's probably outside the door. isn't she?

358
00:18:55.486 --> 00:18:58.086
She told you to come
in. She's like "Henri."

359
00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:00.000
"Henri."

360
00:19:00.374 --> 00:19:03.374
- "Bring her cake. make her feel better."
- She simply likes the idea of it.

361
00:19:04.285 --> 00:19:05.852
- Of who?
- Of this.

362
00:19:05.918 --> 00:19:07.034
- Of what?

363
00:19:09.817 --> 00:19:13.117
This is our minister who's
going to marry us. Ready?

364
00:19:13.524 --> 00:19:16.568
Do you Henry with an
'i' take Julia with an 'aʼ?

365
00:19:16.634 --> 00:19:18.777
- Shut up.
- Is that a yes?

366
00:19:19.893 --> 00:19:22.927
- Can you eat some cake or I'm going to eat it.
- Here's your wedding cake.

367
00:19:24.643 --> 00:19:26.547
- Awww.
- That's so good.

368
00:19:26.837 --> 00:19:27.959
- Stop it.

369
00:19:28.025 --> 00:19:29.373
- You going to give me a kiss?

370
00:19:29.768 --> 00:19:31.668
- Maybe.
- Hmm.

371
00:19:35.042 --> 00:19:39.158
- [Julia] I was asked to be in a polyamorous
relationship in New York before I met Patrick.

372
00:19:39.668 --> 00:19:42.142
- Really?
- Yep. Twice. Two different people.

373
00:19:42.374 --> 00:19:47.803
I started talking about the vaginas I was making
and the art forms we were doing because right.

374
00:19:48.143 --> 00:19:50.609
So I was describing the work that I do.

375
00:19:50.675 --> 00:19:53.791
And this lady is like "Oh how awesome.
Hey meet my husband."

376
00:19:54.209 --> 00:19:56.443
I was like "Oh hi" and
he was like "Hi. Iʼm Ted."

377
00:19:56.509 --> 00:19:59.934
They meet up with me a week later for coffee
and then "Look. we want to tell you something."

378
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.560
"We practice polyamory and we'd
love for you to be our next threesome."

379
00:20:06.243 --> 00:20:07.355
- Wow.

380
00:20:08.283 --> 00:20:09.609
Sounds like a pretty good offer.

381
00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:11.233
- [Julia] It was a pretty good offer.

382
00:20:13.377 --> 00:20:15.000
She's a lawyer on Wall Street.

383
00:20:16.601 --> 00:20:18.061
- Millie was a lawyer.

384
00:20:18.127 --> 00:20:19.427
Don't need any more of them.

385
00:20:22.243 --> 00:20:25.603
Too structured. Just just go with the flow.

386
00:20:26.555 --> 00:20:31.070
- That's what I did and apparently. according to you
and my parents. I'm a piece of shit for doing that.

387
00:20:31.136 --> 00:20:36.829
"Go with the flow but make sure you have an
encyclopedia of what you have to do. like rules."

388
00:20:37.063 --> 00:20:39.263
- Go with the flow and
lying are two different things.

389
00:20:39.329 --> 00:20:40.625
- I didn't lie!

390
00:20:40.691 --> 00:20:42.401
- All right. all right. you didn't lie.

391
00:20:43.105 --> 00:20:46.499
- You didn't say to me ever.
"Hey Julia. are you married?"

392
00:20:46.933 --> 00:20:48.371
Did you?

393
00:20:49.067 --> 00:20:50.099
- How was I meant to –

394
00:20:50.165 --> 00:20:52.643
- Right. So I didn't lie to you.
- Who would ask someone if they're married?

395
00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:55.943
- I could be like. "Right now.
do you have constipation?"

396
00:20:56.009 --> 00:20:57.143
- [Henri] That is the dumbest thing.

397
00:20:57.209 --> 00:21:00.293
- No. really. And if you had it and
you said no then it would be a lie.

398
00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:03.907
But if I didn't know to ask you.
that's all that happened. So...

399
00:21:05.001 --> 00:21:07.993
- I didn't ask for your view.
- I didn't lie to you. We've been through this. come on!

400
00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:09.375
- No. itʼs fine.

401
00:21:10.303 --> 00:21:12.537
- I didn't lie.
- Yes. you didn't lie.

402
00:21:12.603 --> 00:21:14.701
- I just didn't tell you.
- Yes.

403
00:21:14.767 --> 00:21:17.651
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.
I wasn't ready to tell you sooner.

404
00:21:18.274 --> 00:21:20.874
- What made you decide to just get married?

405
00:21:21.173 --> 00:21:22.321
- He asked me.

406
00:21:23.357 --> 00:21:24.626
- [Henri] That's it?

407
00:21:26.005 --> 00:21:27.941
- It was fun.
- Is that how it happens?

408
00:21:28.007 --> 00:21:29.054
- Fuck you.

409
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.552
He was impulsive. He was like
I've got some time this weekend.

410
00:21:33.618 --> 00:21:35.970
Do you want to go to Vegas? I was like.
"Yeah. let's go to Vegas!"

411
00:21:36.036 --> 00:21:38.218
- I've got some time this weekend!
- And when we got to Vegas.

412
00:21:38.284 --> 00:21:42.174
he's like "Do you want to marry me?"
I was like "Yes! That sounds great!"

413
00:21:43.215 --> 00:21:45.369
- So we did it.
- Seems like a pretty quick decision.

414
00:21:45.435 --> 00:21:47.507
- You just said follow the fucking flow.

415
00:21:47.959 --> 00:21:51.677
- I didn't mean to go get married.
- Yeah. follow the flow but don't do this. don't do that.

416
00:21:51.743 --> 00:21:53.461
Well the flow got me married!

417
00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:55.145
- Sure did.

418
00:21:55.211 --> 00:21:58.805
- I was flowing with my menstrual cycle.
- You're married and what are we doing now?

419
00:22:01.147 --> 00:22:02.261
- Come to bed.

420
00:22:04.137 --> 00:22:05.253
How are you?

421
00:22:06.313 --> 00:22:08.713
- [Julia] That's the question.
- [Henri] I'm good.

422
00:22:11.481 --> 00:22:12.939
- [Julia] This is nice.

423
00:22:45.232 --> 00:22:46.380
(kiss)

424
00:23:10.457 --> 00:23:13.418
(romantic music)

425
00:23:52.197 --> 00:23:54.840
(moaning)

426
00:24:06.037 --> 00:24:07.185
(loud moan)

427
00:24:57.951 --> 00:24:59.835
(grunting and moaning)

428
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.656
(slow heavy breathing)

429
00:27:19.381 --> 00:27:21.315
(moaning)

430
00:27:25.608 --> 00:27:27.443
(sad music)

431
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:50.998
(phone beep)

432
00:42:17.616 --> 00:42:19.807
(sad music)

433
00:43:16.142 --> 00:43:17.388
(moaning)

434
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:32.138
(intense music)

435
00:43:47.334 --> 00:43:48.553
(moaning and grunting)

436
00:50:26.159 --> 00:50:28.349
(heartbeat and heavy breathing)

437
00:50:41.345 --> 00:50:43.550
(crashing waves)

438
00:51:14.299 --> 00:51:15.444
(wooden spoon tapping)

439
00:51:51.989 --> 00:51:53.627
- How was your day honey?

440
00:51:54.186 --> 00:51:55.728
-[Milana] It was fine.

441
00:51:55.964 --> 00:51:57.330
- [Rosalie] Yeah. what did you do?

442
00:51:57.396 --> 00:51:59.031
- Studied all day.

443
00:51:59.768 --> 00:52:02.174
- [Rosalie] What. exactly?
What was happening?

444
00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:06.420
- [Milana] Children of war
and generational violence.

445
00:52:16.843 --> 00:52:20.543
- You know today in
the office. it was crazy.

446
00:52:21.917 --> 00:52:23.317
We got a new software.

447
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.944
And nobody is understanding it.
We are all struggling.

448
00:52:27.967 --> 00:52:29.467
So complicated.

449
00:52:30.337 --> 00:52:33.227
Do not get why we got a new system.

450
00:52:34.947 --> 00:52:38.935
- I'm sure you'll will be
fine baby. you're so smart.

451
00:52:41.005 --> 00:52:45.344
- And you know when I went home.
I saw this couple again.

452
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:49.182
With the crazy hair. You know we saw
at the bar with the pink hair?

453
00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:52.168
- [Rosalie] They wear it all the the time like this.
- [Milana] Really?

454
00:52:52.234 --> 00:52:56.568
- [Rosalie] Yeah. that's crazy. You'll never
find a job like this. Not in the office.

455
00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:02.032
Yum... Yeah. I think it's
good. in a few minutes.

456
00:53:02.935 --> 00:53:06.535
So maybe. do you think...

457
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:09.292
We can have a little time?

458
00:53:09.358 --> 00:53:10.981
- No. baby.

459
00:53:11.047 --> 00:53:14.144
I really have to study. I have a
test tomorrow. you know.

460
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:15.795
- You sure?
- Yeah

461
00:53:16.315 --> 00:53:18.451
- Oh. ok. Got it.

462
00:53:30.809 --> 00:53:32.509
Oh. so that's your study. huh?

463
00:53:33.491 --> 00:53:35.391
You're studying prostitutes?

464
00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:37.684
- No.

465
00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:39.615
- [Rosalie] Good ass though.

466
00:53:40.141 --> 00:53:42.141
What does this say about her character?

467
00:53:42.373 --> 00:53:43.373
- [Milana] You tell me.

468
00:53:44.489 --> 00:53:45.749
I think you know best.

469
00:53:45.815 --> 00:53:47.115
- I think you are a dirty girl.

470
00:53:47.638 --> 00:53:50.630
(phone rings)

471
00:53:53.153 --> 00:53:55.313
- Luka?
- No.

472
00:53:55.733 --> 00:53:56.907
Hello.

473
00:53:58.081 --> 00:53:59.733
How are you?

474
00:54:10.209 --> 00:54:11.454
(camera click)

475
00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.064
- Is it for your Instagram.
or for Sugar Babies Online?

476
00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:15.246
- Instagram.

477
00:54:16.223 --> 00:54:17.957
I look disgusting.

478
00:54:18.023 --> 00:54:19.857
- You don't look disgusting.

479
00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:21.723
Don't say something like that.

480
00:54:22.633 --> 00:54:24.793
- I like this underwear
though. it's very nice colour.

481
00:54:24.981 --> 00:54:26.285
- It is.

482
00:54:27.561 --> 00:54:29.261
I think we could improve the image.

483
00:54:29.493 --> 00:54:30.811
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

484
00:54:31.159 --> 00:54:32.406
- What would you suggest?

485
00:54:33.075 --> 00:54:34.509
- Try again?

486
00:54:34.741 --> 00:54:35.987
- Okay. yeah.

487
00:54:38.017 --> 00:54:39.651
- And maybe like that?

488
00:54:39.717 --> 00:54:41.017
(laughing)

489
00:54:41.481 --> 00:54:42.415
(camera click)

490
00:54:42.481 --> 00:54:43.793
Maybe that's better?

491
00:54:44.199 --> 00:54:45.343
- That's much better.

492
00:54:45.409 --> 00:54:48.409
- People have to see that your
tits are real nice you know.

493
00:54:48.989 --> 00:54:50.369
- They're real.

494
00:54:50.435 --> 00:54:51.735
- Oh. they're real.

495
00:54:52.141 --> 00:54:53.418
Real tits.

496
00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:56.630
(giggling)

497
00:54:58.777 --> 00:55:00.145
They're better. aren't they?

498
00:55:01.251 --> 00:55:03.025
(squealing and laughing)

499
00:55:03.709 --> 00:55:06.806
- You can do that later.
- Whoa. do that later!

500
00:55:11.501 --> 00:55:12.816
(kissing and heavy breathing)

501
00:55:25.997 --> 00:55:27.792
- [Milana] I love it when you do that.

502
00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:32.844
Take that off.

503
00:55:43.318 --> 00:55:44.475
(heavy breathing)

504
00:55:56.381 --> 00:55:57.415
(laughing)

505
00:56:03.772 --> 00:56:05.396
- Bye bye panties.

506
00:56:08.645 --> 00:56:10.072
(romantic music)

507
00:56:35.078 --> 00:56:36.300
(moaning)

508
00:56:37.206 --> 00:56:38.376
(spitting)

509
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:25.132
- Sweet to see how bad you are.

510
00:58:33.767 --> 00:58:34.999
(laughing)

511
00:58:42.622 --> 00:58:43.805
(phone ringing)

512
00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:52.704
- Luka?

513
00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.820
Is it Luka?

514
00:58:55.344 --> 00:58:56.960
- [Milana] Luka.

515
00:59:00.557 --> 00:59:01.833
Luka.

516
00:59:22.835 --> 00:59:24.646
(foreboding music)

517
00:59:34.441 --> 00:59:35.962
(dance music)

518
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.594
- [Rosalie] Hey. cutie!

519
01:00:04.473 --> 01:00:06.077
- How are you?
- I'm fine. how are you?

520
01:00:06.143 --> 01:00:07.643
- I'm good. We're almost done.

521
01:00:08.165 --> 01:00:09.599
- It's ok. let's hang out.

522
01:00:09.665 --> 01:00:11.175
- Want to have a drink?
- Yes.

523
01:00:17.963 --> 01:00:19.615
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

524
01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.174
(music off)

525
01:00:44.123 --> 01:00:45.627
- [Rosalie] Cutie. how was your day?

526
01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:49.575
- You look tired.
- I am so tired. Fuck.

527
01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:54.200
So sick of all these men in Berlin. They
just take so much. I give so much.

528
01:00:55.211 --> 01:00:57.387
- Maybe you should quit.
- Yeah?

529
01:00:57.813 --> 01:00:59.153
- Get a normal job.

530
01:00:59.219 --> 01:01:00.663
- Normal job?
- Yeah.

531
01:01:00.729 --> 01:01:02.613
- What can I do?
- Or a job in a bar.

532
01:01:03.113 --> 01:01:07.199
- I know I wanted to study. I mean study and
then I want to go work. and you know this.

533
01:01:07.479 --> 01:01:10.297
- But you are already studying and working.

534
01:01:10.363 --> 01:01:11.854
- Yeah. but...
- So?

535
01:01:12.281 --> 01:01:16.955
- I mean work after as a psychologist.
- I thought just because you said you don't like it.

536
01:01:17.021 --> 01:01:18.227
- Yeah.

537
01:01:19.063 --> 01:01:21.038
- That's okay. cutie.

538
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.311
- Yeah. but I mean...

539
01:01:24.626 --> 01:01:27.376
Luca is okay though. He's not so bad.

540
01:01:27.442 --> 01:01:28.551
- Okay.

541
01:01:29.621 --> 01:01:31.969
At least he's smart.

542
01:01:32.453 --> 01:01:34.169
Knows a lot about business.

543
01:01:36.597 --> 01:01:37.713
A lot of money.

544
01:01:40.723 --> 01:01:43.781
- So... what's the plan for tonight?

545
01:01:44.557 --> 01:01:46.810
You're tired. just go
home and have a pizza?

546
01:01:46.876 --> 01:01:49.470
- Rosalie. I have to tell you something.

547
01:01:49.536 --> 01:01:51.770
So Luca is coming to Berlin.

548
01:01:51.836 --> 01:01:55.952
Give me a lot of money to stay
in his villa while he's here for one week.

549
01:01:56.184 --> 01:01:57.300
And I said yes.

550
01:01:59.768 --> 01:02:01.071
- You...

551
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:04.620
Staying with him one week?

552
01:02:05.859 --> 01:02:07.009
- [Milana] Just one week.

553
01:02:07.473 --> 01:02:08.545
One week only.

554
01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:11.042
- And you already said yes?

555
01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:20.493
- [Milana] I know should have. obviously
should have talked to you. but –

556
01:02:20.559 --> 01:02:21.859
- Yeah. obviously.

557
01:02:24.117 --> 01:02:25.327
- It's a lot of money.

558
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:31.649
(sighs)

559
01:02:34.001 --> 01:02:38.401
- [Rosalie] Why didn't we talk about this before?
- [Milana] Obviously it doesn't mean anything. You know this.

560
01:02:39.269 --> 01:02:41.497
- So you say always. it
doesn't mean anything.

561
01:02:41.563 --> 01:02:43.629
- [Milana] It doesn't mean anything.
- [Rosalie] He is calling at night.

562
01:02:43.695 --> 01:02:47.044
- You're speaking a language I can't understand.
I don't know what the hell you are talking about.

563
01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:49.244
- It's work.
- He's texting every fucking –

564
01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:51.414
- It's work. Rosalie.
- Every fucking day. he is texting you.

565
01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.804
- It's always. always work.

566
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:54.270
- It's too much

567
01:02:59.035 --> 01:03:03.655
I have a feeling you are spending more time
texting Luca than we are spending time together.

568
01:03:05.337 --> 01:03:07.529
- That's fucking ridiculous.

569
01:03:07.877 --> 01:03:09.761
We're together all the time.

570
01:03:10.543 --> 01:03:12.013
- Is it too much for you?

571
01:03:12.419 --> 01:03:13.779
- No.
- You want to break?

572
01:03:13.845 --> 01:03:15.000
- No!

573
01:03:17.179 --> 01:03:18.679
- Then why you do this?

574
01:03:21.237 --> 01:03:22.741
Why you do this. Milana?

575
01:03:23.321 --> 01:03:24.379
- What did I do?

576
01:03:24.805 --> 01:03:26.405
I need this. I need the money.

577
01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:31.839
We can do so much with this.

578
01:03:42.623 --> 01:03:44.229
- [Rosalie] So you said yes?

579
01:03:45.297 --> 01:03:46.866
When do you go over there?

580
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:49.131
When is it?

581
01:03:49.197 --> 01:03:50.697
- Day after tomorrow.

582
01:03:58.645 --> 01:03:59.730
(sigh)

583
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:03.689
- Can I ask you something?

584
01:04:05.941 --> 01:04:06.947
- Yes.

585
01:04:07.501 --> 01:04:09.333
- Are you sure you still love me?

586
01:04:11.067 --> 01:04:12.473
- [Rosalie] Yeah?
- [Milana] Yes.

587
01:04:16.499 --> 01:04:18.710
- I love you more than
I've ever loved anyone.

588
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:21.079
Ever.

589
01:04:26.457 --> 01:04:28.057
- So you do it for one week.

590
01:04:29.715 --> 01:04:30.947
- [Milana] Then maybe I stop.

591
01:04:31.941 --> 01:04:32.973
Yeah?

592
01:04:34.945 --> 01:04:36.126
-Okay.

593
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:42.549
One time a lot of money and then stop.

594
01:04:43.819 --> 01:04:45.419
I understand that.

595
01:04:46.377 --> 01:04:47.577
It's okay.

596
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.539
It's okay. honey. I'll just get my stuff.

597
01:04:54.353 --> 01:04:55.953
I'm tired. let's go home

598
01:04:58.011 --> 01:04:59.311
Get a pizza.

599
01:05:13.764 --> 01:05:15.264
- [ Milana] It's fine.

600
01:05:15.571 --> 01:05:16.871
Thirty minutes. okay?

601
01:05:17.685 --> 01:05:19.485
I'll just have a quick shower.

602
01:05:20.737 --> 01:05:22.340
Okay.

603
01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:25.490
I am sorry Rosalie. I have
a fucking appointment.

604
01:05:26.927 --> 01:05:28.807
- Thought you quit?

605
01:05:30.627 --> 01:05:32.627
- Somebody's got to make money. right?

606
01:05:33.584 --> 01:05:34.884
- I'm not making money. huh?

607
01:05:36.565 --> 01:05:38.365
- I need to make money
for me. you know this.

608
01:05:39.418 --> 01:05:41.418
- That's nice. fucking strangers.

609
01:05:44.125 --> 01:05:45.324
- [Milana] Off to shower.

610
01:05:47.673 --> 01:05:49.153
- Thought we were going to eat pizza?

611
01:05:49.256 --> 01:05:50.590
- Yeah. we will eat pizza.

612
01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:52.590
- When? When?
- After I work.

613
01:05:52.656 --> 01:05:55.956
- Yeah. after you work. You take shower
and then you go fuck on camera.

614
01:05:57.112 --> 01:06:00.560
- It's not a job.
- It's a job for me.

615
01:06:00.626 --> 01:06:02.486
- You said you will stop after Luka.

616
01:06:02.803 --> 01:06:04.537
- I will stop after Luka.
- Just Luka. then stop.

617
01:06:04.603 --> 01:06:06.810
- I will. I will stop!
- Why take this job?

618
01:06:06.876 --> 01:06:08.946
- [Rosalie] You fucking addict.
you're a fucking sex addict!

619
01:06:09.012 --> 01:06:10.714
- I'm not a fucking sex addict!

620
01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.786
- [Rosalie] I don't know why you are doing this to me!
- [Milana] Fuck you!

621
01:06:12.852 --> 01:06:13.976
- Fucking cunt!

622
01:06:14.042 --> 01:06:15.769
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

623
01:06:15.835 --> 01:06:17.617
- No fuck you. stop it!
- Fuck you!

624
01:06:17.683 --> 01:06:18.760
(door slams shut)

625
01:06:21.429 --> 01:06:23.782
(intense music)

626
01:08:09.126 --> 01:08:10.542
- I love you.

627
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.855
- [Milana] I'm sorry.

643
01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:53.154

663
01:11:09.251 --> 01:11:10.851
Do you like it?

664
01:11:11.138 --> 01:11:13.318
- [Client] Ah yeah.
- It's just for you.

665
01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:17.069
- You're making me so horny.

666
01:11:19.113 --> 01:11:21.523
I'm already so wet for you.

667
01:11:23.642 --> 01:11:25.453
(moans)

668
01:11:29.473 --> 01:11:31.473
I'm so wet for you.

669
01:11:38.292 --> 01:11:40.708
- [Milana] Such a dirty old man.

670

(giggling)

671
01:11:51.786 --> 01:11:54.086
- Two lesbians are better than one.

672
01:12:01.798 --> 01:12:04.162
(fake giggling)

673
01:12:04.626 --> 01:12:06.104
(panting)

674
01:12:06.876 --> 01:12:08.176
- Do you love this?

675
01:12:08.463 --> 01:12:10.903
- Tell me how much you love this. Milana?

676
01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:15.551
- Stopping after Luka? What the
fuck are you doing to me?

677
01:12:16.101 --> 01:12:18.135
Why you are always doing this to me?

678
01:12:18.201 --> 01:12:22.401
I'm fed up with it! You said
you stop! You said you quit!

679
01:12:22.928 --> 01:12:24.251
(Milana whimpering)

680
01:12:26.655 --> 01:12:29.037
- Tell me you stop.
- I didn't. I didn't.

681
01:12:29.517 --> 01:12:31.334
(Milana crying)

682
01:12:36.498 --> 01:12:38.271
- Crying little baby.

683
01:12:38.337 --> 01:12:39.673

Look in the mirror!

685
01:12:44.275 --> 01:12:47.649
- [Milana] You control me all the time.
You suffocate me all the time.

686
01:12:47.715 --> 01:12:49.615
I can't even breathe with you.

687
01:12:49.681 --> 01:12:53.051
- So. I let you fuck with the whole
world? And just like. I don't care!

688
01:12:54.061 --> 01:12:55.235
I don't care.

689
01:12:59.095 --> 01:13:01.627
(screaming)

690
01:13:02.909 --> 01:13:04.793
(heavy breathing)

691
01:13:06.313 --> 01:13:08.113
You're not sorry at all. are you?

692
01:13:08.179 --> 01:13:09.722
- I'm sorry.

693
01:13:12.128 --> 01:13:13.880
You're such a bitch!

694
01:13:15.325 --> 01:13:17.685
- Ha. I am the bitch?
You're serious. I'm the bitch?

695
01:13:17.751 --> 01:13:18.959
- You're the bitch.

696
01:13:19.025 --> 01:13:23.083
- You're serious? Tell me who
is the bitch? Who is it?

697
01:13:23.424 --> 01:13:25.402
Who is fucking guys? Who is it?

698
01:13:25.468 --> 01:13:27.672
- Fuck you.
- Who is it? Is it me or is it you?

699
01:13:28.573 --> 01:13:30.407
(heavy breathing)

700
01:13:30.473 --> 01:13:32.647
- Tell me? Tell me Milana.

701
01:13:35.075 --> 01:13:37.475
Who's the slut? Is it me?

702
01:13:39.032 --> 01:13:40.614
Am I the sex addict?

703
01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.322
(crying)

704
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.606
- Why do you treat me like this?

705
01:13:48.196 --> 01:13:51.292
Why you still with me if
you treat me like this?

706
01:13:51.777 --> 01:13:55.145
Why do you love me?

707
01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:00.000
(sobbing)

708
01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:13.183
- [Rosalie] I'm fed up!

709
01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.281
Fucking whore!

710
01:14:15.347 --> 01:14:16.747
- Fuck you

711
01:14:20.636 --> 01:14:23.396
(whimpering)

712
01:14:42.577 --> 01:14:44.977
- [Milana] So Luka has car outside.

713
01:14:50.666 --> 01:14:52.626
I wonder what the villa will be like?

714
01:14:54.447 --> 01:14:56.147
Maybe they'll be a jacuzzi.

715
01:15:00.459 --> 01:15:03.959
So I shouldn't be gone
for too long. a week at most.

716
01:15:14.071 --> 01:15:16.821
Okay. so...

717
01:15:17.151 --> 01:15:19.250
I'm leaving.

718
01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:22.175
Do you want to say bye?

719
01:15:23.644 --> 01:15:24.763
- Sure.

720
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.539
(kiss)

721
01:15:55.701 --> 01:15:56.989
- [Rosalie] Goodbye.

722
01:16:04.647 --> 01:16:06.613
(kissing and moaning)

723
01:16:08.817 --> 01:16:10.616
(romantic music)

724
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.700
- I missed you so much.

725
01:16:21.493 --> 01:16:22.783
- Me too.

726
01:16:31.138 --> 01:16:32.582
(kissing)

727
01:16:47.551 --> 01:16:48.609
(chuckles)

728
01:16:49.537 --> 01:16:50.797
- Hey.
- Hey.

729
01:17:15.677 --> 01:17:17.035
- Where are you going?

730
01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:21.135
Come back to bed. Tell me about your trip.

731
01:17:26.635 --> 01:17:28.535
- Umm. I guess.

732
01:17:30.348 --> 01:17:32.600
We had a party with friends.

733
01:17:33.367 --> 01:17:35.567
We had a surprise party.

734
01:17:35.993 --> 01:17:37.167
- For you?
- Yeah. It was fun.

735
01:17:37.832 --> 01:17:39.476
- That's cool. Were your parents there?

736
01:17:39.542 --> 01:17:42.354
- No. it was just my friends. Z was there.
So it was nice to see her.

737
01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:44.016
- Z?
- Zara.

738
01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.651
- But you talked to your parents?

739
01:17:49.584 --> 01:17:51.109
- Yeah. I...

740
01:17:51.979 --> 01:17:53.109
I don't think I'll be …

741
01:17:54.417 --> 01:17:56.617
I don't think I'll be talking to
them again for a while.

742
01:17:57.017 --> 01:17:58.023
- Why?

743
01:18:00.243 --> 01:18:02.843
- They don't like that I'm
here and that I am married.

744
01:18:03.677 --> 01:18:06.411
- I gave them the painting –
- So it's the whole package?

745
01:18:06.477 --> 01:18:07.567
- I guess.

746
01:18:08.219 --> 01:18:09.566
- Well. I mean...

747
01:18:11.248 --> 01:18:13.573
They love you. right? They'll come around.

748
01:18:14.385 --> 01:18:17.153
- They want you to be happy. right?
- Hey. I need to...

749
01:18:18.571 --> 01:18:20.105
I need to tell you something.

750
01:18:21.347 --> 01:18:22.947
- Okay.
- Okay.

751
01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:25.250
- So...

752
01:18:26.178 --> 01:18:29.934
I want you to know before I
tell you that I want you to

753
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.078
trust that I...

754
01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.136
I love you.

755
01:18:37.334 --> 01:18:41.454
I'm so happy to be your
wife and be with you.

756
01:18:42.595 --> 01:18:44.934
- Good.
- Make art and create.

757
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.710
- So far so good.

758
01:18:48.259 --> 01:18:50.059
- But when we met.

759
01:18:51.534 --> 01:18:56.214
you said you loved me for who
I was and you knew who I was and

760
01:18:56.678 --> 01:18:59.032
my identity.

761
01:18:59.098 --> 01:19:01.088
my connection to soul and body.

762
01:19:04.853 --> 01:19:07.623
I've never found someone
that I've just wanted to

763
01:19:08.289 --> 01:19:10.023
just be with. just you.

764
01:19:10.089 --> 01:19:11.521
But I...

765
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.448
(sad music)

766
01:19:17.065 --> 01:19:19.865
I made a mistake. And I'm sorry.

767
01:19:22.117 --> 01:19:23.349
I'm sorry.

768
01:19:26.007 --> 01:19:28.601
- What are you talking about?
You made a mistake?

769
01:19:28.667 --> 01:19:30.261
Tell me what you're talking about?

770
01:19:30.327 --> 01:19:32.327
- I slept with Henri in Melbourne.

771
01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:34.159
- Henri in Melbourne?
- Yeah.

772
01:19:35.817 --> 01:19:37.761
- It was just one time.
- Henri. your friend?

773
01:19:37.827 --> 01:19:40.817
- Yeah. he's been a
friend for a long time and

774
01:19:41.275 --> 01:19:43.875
we've had a connection
for a very long time.

775
01:19:49.059 --> 01:19:50.291
Hey.

776
01:19:53.333 --> 01:19:55.818
I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you.

777
01:19:56.883 --> 01:19:59.227
Before it happened.

778
01:20:00.259 --> 01:20:01.577
I mean that.

779
01:20:02.853 --> 01:20:04.041
Babe?

780
01:20:06.826 --> 01:20:08.031
Baby?

781
01:20:14.443 --> 01:20:16.283
It's me. I'm still the...

782
01:20:16.689 --> 01:20:17.789
same person.

783
01:20:18.859 --> 01:20:20.359
- You know like...

784
01:20:21.949 --> 01:20:25.949
I'm like a virgin in this kind of thing.
right? You know that like I'm a virgin?

785
01:20:26.356 --> 01:20:27.598
Right?

786
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.034
You're my first time with
this kind of thing. right?

787
01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:34.100
- I know. I know that and I...

788
01:20:35.243 --> 01:20:36.452
- And we set up...

789
01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:39.450
- You set up...
- Yeah.

790
01:20:40.472 --> 01:20:41.951
- Protocols.
- Yeah.

791
01:20:42.017 --> 01:20:43.667
- For what?
- Yes.

792
01:20:46.319 --> 01:20:50.087
- I've never wanted to...

793
01:20:50.377 --> 01:20:52.095
I've never not wanted to …

794
01:20:52.419 --> 01:20:56.353
I've never only wanted to
experience you or someone

795
01:20:56.419 --> 01:20:59.113
for the amount of time that
I have... that I've been with you.

796
01:20:59.179 --> 01:21:01.005
- Well. you haven't.

797
01:21:01.251 --> 01:21:03.005
You haven't.

798
01:21:03.295 --> 01:21:04.501
- What do you mean?

799
01:21:04.567 --> 01:21:08.085
- Well. you haven't only experienced me.
now Henri is part of the picture.

800
01:21:08.151 --> 01:21:10.385
- He's not part of the
picture. It was a one-off thing.

801
01:21:10.451 --> 01:21:14.185
- Well. right now. in my picture.

802
01:21:14.251 --> 01:21:16.115
he is part of the picture.

803
01:21:16.181 --> 01:21:17.833
- Okay.
- Because that is my picture.

804
01:21:17.899 --> 01:21:21.470
I know that you've had time. right?
I don't know. when did this happen?

805
01:21:21.536 --> 01:21:24.036
- It was once. It was one time with –

806
01:21:24.403 --> 01:21:27.133
- When? Like when you started.
at the middle. at the end?

807
01:21:27.199 --> 01:21:31.250
- Did you get bored? Did you –
- I didn't get bored. It's not about being bored.

808
01:21:31.731 --> 01:21:33.379
It's about connection.

809
01:21:33.901 --> 01:21:35.692
And that's who I was when you married me.

810
01:21:35.758 --> 01:21:38.770
- So. I didn't call enough?
- No.

811
01:21:38.836 --> 01:21:41.454
- Or you weren't feeling our connection?

812
01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.114
- No. I felt our connection still.

813
01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:45.514
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
before it happened. I mean that.

814
01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.414
I know that was our deal. I'm sorry.

815
01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.183
I want to be able to do
that for you in the future.

816
01:21:49.249 --> 01:21:51.183
- I really do –
- I know. I know. I know you're sorry.

817
01:21:51.249 --> 01:21:53.450
I can't hear you say that right now.

818
01:21:53.914 --> 01:21:55.392
I've heard you say it.

819
01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:57.277
- It happened...

820
01:21:58.554 --> 01:22:00.348
at my parent's place.

821
01:22:02.349 --> 01:22:03.703
- Where were they?

822
01:22:03.769 --> 01:22:07.169
- They were... They
had invited him for dinner.

823
01:22:07.892 --> 01:22:09.900
- They were home?
- Yeah.

824
01:22:11.255 --> 01:22:13.855
- And you and Henri
were in the same bedroom?

825
01:22:14.145 --> 01:22:17.367
- I don't know. My mum –
- You don't know? You don't know?

826
01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:19.433
- We had a huge fight. I hadn't –

827
01:22:19.803 --> 01:22:20.937
- Who had a huge fight?

828
01:22:21.003 --> 01:22:22.937
Me and my parents had a fight.

829
01:22:23.003 --> 01:22:26.937
- You fought and you didn't know which
bedroom you were in because you were fighting.

830
01:22:27.003 --> 01:22:28.437
- No. I was in my room.

831
01:22:28.503 --> 01:22:32.037
- You were in your room. And Henri was in the room.
- He came in.

832
01:22:32.103 --> 01:22:34.537
- He came in. So he was somewhere
else and he came in.

833
01:22:34.603 --> 01:22:37.755
- He offered me a piece of cake and –

834
01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:41.705
- And a little more
than cake it sounds like.

835
01:22:44.547 --> 01:22:45.852
- Okay.

836
01:22:48.521 --> 01:22:50.521
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

837
01:22:51.573 --> 01:22:52.997
And I know it's tough.

838
01:22:53.063 --> 01:22:55.663
And I won't say that 's'
word again. but I really...

839
01:23:01.857 --> 01:23:03.229
I love you.

840
01:23:03.295 --> 01:23:04.585
- I love you too.

841
01:23:06.727 --> 01:23:08.126
I love you too.

842
01:23:21.029 --> 01:23:22.529
- This is new for me too.

843
01:23:30.877 --> 01:23:32.077
Baby?

844
01:23:33.179 --> 01:23:34.394
(Patrick sighs)

845
01:23:55.668 --> 01:23:56.917
Hey?

846
01:24:12.388 --> 01:24:13.684
(footsteps)

847
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.022
- Good Morning.

848
01:24:16.354 --> 01:24:17.644
- Morning.

849
01:24:18.013 --> 01:24:19.576
Do you want some of this?

850
01:24:20.477 --> 01:24:22.077
- No. I am okay. Thanks.

851
01:24:23.009 --> 01:24:25.614
- I'm sure you are okay. I just wanted
to know if you wanted some coffee.

852
01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.909
- That alright?
- That's fine. Yeah

853
01:24:27.975 --> 01:24:30.114
- I got most of it. so if you
want some later.

854
01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:32.727
So. listen. what you got on today?

855
01:24:33.343 --> 01:24:34.903
- I have a meeting for that commission.

856
01:24:35.964 --> 01:24:37.586
- Which commission?

857
01:24:38.224 --> 01:24:40.291
- The one for the parks.

858
01:24:40.639 --> 01:24:41.848
- Yes?

01:24:41.914 --> 01:24:43.767
- Thank you. Which parks?

861
01:24:46.078 --> 01:24:47.234
(phone vibrating)

862
01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:49.533
- [Patrick] Oh. right. That's
great. Awesome.

863
01:24:49.599 --> 01:24:52.894
I've got to get over to Carol's to
give her the spare set of keys.

864
01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.995
Do you know where they are?
(phone vibrating)

865
01:24:55.352 --> 01:24:57.423
I thought you used them last time.

866
01:24:58.410 --> 01:25:00.000
- Wasn't it you? Okay.
- No.

867
01:25:00.212 --> 01:25:01.719
- They're not here.
- Alright.

868
01:25:01.785 --> 01:25:03.218
- Fuck! What am I going to do?

869
01:25:04.892 --> 01:25:06.732
Do you know what time
the hardware store opens?

870
01:25:07.758 --> 01:25:09.544
- No.
(phone message beep)

871
01:25:10.489 --> 01:25:11.605
- You gonna get that?

872
01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.073
- No. it's alright.

873
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
- Look. if you want to talk
to your friend.

874
01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.460
- It's fine. He can leave
a message or whatever.

875
01:25:20.939 --> 01:25:23.539
- Well. you can check the
message. See if he left one.

876
01:25:23.935 --> 01:25:28.255
I am open with it. This is an open
relationship. right? So I am open to it.

877
01:25:28.727 --> 01:25:30.000

01:25:31.395 --> 01:25:35.364
- [Henri] Hey. Jules. Just checking in to

879
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:36.995
Hope it's all going well.

880
01:25:37.061 --> 01:25:38.525
No doubt you're very busy.

01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:40.891

882
01:25:41.259 --> 01:25:42.807
Chat to you soon. Bye.

883
01:25:44.668 --> 01:25:46.008
- Got a sec?

884
01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:48.500
- [Julia] No. I said
I will call back later.

885
01:25:51.828 --> 01:25:53.292
- Okay. Jules.

886
01:25:54.554 --> 01:25:55.928
- Thanks. Patrick.

887
01:25:57.646 --> 01:25:59.934
- [Patrick] Alright. I'm going to go.
- [Julia] Okay

888
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.874
- Bye.
- Bye.

889
01:26:22.812 --> 01:26:24.048
(footsteps)

890
01:26:25.142 --> 01:26:26.918
- Hello.
- Hi.

891
01:26:31.121 --> 01:26:32.962
(phone slapped down)
- Damn it.

892
01:26:36.844 --> 01:26:38.044
- What's...

893
01:26:43.119 --> 01:26:44.264
- [Julia] What's going on?

894
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.503
- I'm checking my email.
that's what's going on.

895
01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:49.940
- Okay.

896
01:26:50.611 --> 01:26:51.809
- [ Patrick] No. Michael.

897
01:26:52.433 --> 01:26:53.793
- [Julia] I'm Julia.

898
01:26:55.693 --> 01:26:57.193
- Oh my God! It's Julia.

899
01:26:58.007 --> 01:27:00.171
Yeah. I know. I'm talking to Michael.

900
01:27:00.237 --> 01:27:02.307
Michael seems to think that
the opening is happening

901
01:27:02.637 --> 01:27:04.571
on a Friday instead of a Thursday.

902
01:27:04.637 --> 01:27:07.637
- What the fuck?
- Yeah. the fuck. Exactly.

903
01:27:07.903 --> 01:27:09.367
- Oh. what?

904
01:27:10.805 --> 01:27:13.043
- [Julia] Do we need to –
how do we change that?

905
01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:15.739
- People have to come on Thursday.
- We don't have to do anything.

906
01:27:15.805 --> 01:27:19.349
I am just sharing with you
because we share a privileged overlap.

907
01:27:19.415 --> 01:27:21.439
A Venn diagram of reality. right?

908
01:27:21.505 --> 01:27:23.665
So. I am just sharing with you. That's all.

909
01:27:23.731 --> 01:27:26.497
- Do I need to –
- No. you don't have to do a thing except make your art.

910
01:27:26.563 --> 01:27:28.729
- That's very nice. by the way.
- My art's made. thank you.

911
01:27:28.795 --> 01:27:31.302
I am just chilling out.
I am just doing this to chill out.

912
01:27:32.001 --> 01:27:33.830
- I hung everything this morning.
- Ok. I'm glad you're chill.

913
01:27:33.896 --> 01:27:36.621
- Yeah I am.
- So be chill. That's cool.

914
01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.405
(phone message beep)
- [Julia] I am chill.

915
01:27:39.471 --> 01:27:43.722
- Oh my God. Sheila. no! Fuck.

916
01:27:45.318 --> 01:27:46.588
(sigh)

917
01:27:48.644 --> 01:27:51.564
No. just do what you do. Be brilliant.

918
01:27:51.854 --> 01:27:53.086
Be beautiful.

919
01:27:55.399 --> 01:27:58.705
Be attractive. You're going to attract
all these new people to your work.

920
01:27:58.771 --> 01:27:59.934
it's going to be great.

921
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.500
- Okay. Thanks Patrick.

922
01:28:01.955 --> 01:28:03.045
Cool.

923
01:28:03.424 --> 01:28:04.852
- Are you –
- How did Michael get the day wrong?

924
01:28:04.918 --> 01:28:06.424
How did that happen?

925
01:28:07.878 --> 01:28:10.878
- I think he was dropped as a baby.

926
01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:13.040
I think that's how he got the day wrong.

927
01:28:13.217 --> 01:28:15.751
I think that that's the only way
he could have gotten a day wrong.

928
01:28:15.817 --> 01:28:18.263
because from the beginning.
we've been saying Thursday.

929
01:28:18.817 --> 01:28:21.251
The Gallery always does
their openings on a Thursday.

930
01:28:21.317 --> 01:28:22.751
That's how we've done every opening.

931
01:28:22.817 --> 01:28:24.626
That's how every opening
I've ever gone and I haven't been a part

932
01:28:24.692 --> 01:28:26.626
of has gone at this gallery.
but for some reason.

933
01:28:26.692 --> 01:28:28.692
this guy thought we were
doing it on a Friday.

934
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.634
I don't know. I have no idea.

935
01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:34.491
Maybe he doesn't like Thor. I don't know.

936
01:28:36.619 --> 01:28:38.740
(phone message beep)
- [Julia] Oh my God!

937
01:28:40.379 --> 01:28:41.779
Hey Z!

938
01:28:45.418 --> 01:28:46.984
(chuckles)

939
01:28:47.258 --> 01:28:49.010
- Zara's coming to town. she made it.

940
01:28:49.615 --> 01:28:51.622
Love you babe.

941
01:28:52.086 --> 01:28:53.622
See you tomorrow.

942
01:28:57.501 --> 01:28:58.766
- Thanks babe.

943
01:28:59.223 --> 01:29:01.303
- [Julia] For what?
- [Patrick] I love you too. babe.

944
01:29:01.905 --> 01:29:03.450
- Are you making fun of me?

945
01:29:03.841 --> 01:29:07.457
- [Patrick] No. you said I love you babe.
right? I'm just saying I love you too babe.

946
01:29:08.527 --> 01:29:09.727
- I was texting Z.

947
01:29:11.443 --> 01:29:12.677
- [Patrick] I saw you were texting Z.

948
01:29:12.743 --> 01:29:15.477
But you said. I love you babe
so I thought maybe you're talking to me.

949
01:29:15.543 --> 01:29:18.031
So. I said I love you too. babe.
I was just. you know -

950
01:29:18.097 --> 01:29:20.727
- [Julia] I do love you. but I was texting
Z that I'm excited to see her tomorrow.

951
01:29:20.793 --> 01:29:22.472
She's going to come into town
and see the exhibition.

952
01:29:22.538 --> 01:29:24.208
She's here for the opening.

953
01:29:24.274 --> 01:29:25.490
- [Patrick] The opening?
- Yeah.

954
01:29:25.556 --> 01:29:26.755
- She's here for your opening?

955
01:29:26.821 --> 01:29:28.000
Is that what you're saying?

956
01:29:30.348 --> 01:29:31.435
- Okay.
(Patrick laughs)

957
01:29:31.501 --> 01:29:32.907
- [Julia] That's hilarious.

958
01:29:33.608 --> 01:29:35.864
- Yeah. it's hilarious.
- Yeah.

959
01:29:37.493 --> 01:29:39.119
(sigh)

960
01:29:42.301 --> 01:29:43.374
(phone slammed down)

961
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:50.044
- [Julia VO] Thanks for meeting up today.

962
01:29:50.110 --> 01:29:53.118
I know you are busy.
doing whatever you're doing.

963
01:29:53.184 --> 01:29:56.688
- [Zara VO] I'm busy?

964
01:29:56.754 --> 01:29:59.254
- [Zara VO] Yeah. but tell
me about the exhibition.

965
01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.727
- [Julia] You gonna come?

966
01:30:00.793 --> 01:30:03.533
- Well. I don't know.
Maybe not the opening. but...

967
01:30:03.599 --> 01:30:05.111
I'll definitely come see it.

968
01:30:05.177 --> 01:30:06.995
- What the fuck? Not at the opening?

969
01:30:07.061 --> 01:30:08.655
- Well. I don't want to be there...
- Z!

970
01:30:08.721 --> 01:30:12.375
- Well. isn't it going to weird
with that Patrick guy? Stop.

971
01:30:13.327 --> 01:30:16.627
- Why do you call him that Patrick guy?
What's that about?

972
01:30:16.918 --> 01:30:19.941
- Well. isn't he that guy.
the guy of the moment?

973
01:30:20.007 --> 01:30:21.348
And his name is Patrick.

974
01:30:21.414 --> 01:30:24.155
- Is it because it is a guy. is
that why you are pissed off?

975
01:30:24.221 --> 01:30:25.521
- No.
- Is that why?

976
01:30:28.062 --> 01:30:29.934
- Is that new?
- Stop it!

977
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.352
- [Julia] Is that new?

978
01:30:31.418 --> 01:30:32.712
- [Zara] Yeah. it is. that is new.

979
01:30:32.778 --> 01:30:34.664
And while we are talking about new things.

980
01:30:34.730 --> 01:30:36.762
why don't you want to tell me about this?

981
01:30:39.783 --> 01:30:41.443
- Yeah. we got married.

982
01:30:45.259 --> 01:30:47.559
We got married. Z.

983
01:30:48.255 --> 01:30:49.353
- Wait. so –

984
01:30:49.419 --> 01:30:50.871
- We got married before –
-Wait. wait. wait –

985
01:30:50.937 --> 01:30:52.233
So...

986
01:30:54.476 --> 01:30:56.303
You and Patrick.

987
01:30:56.739 --> 01:30:58.824
- Got married?
- Uh-huh.

988
01:31:01.732 --> 01:31:03.638
It felt right. You know.

989
01:31:03.704 --> 01:31:06.635
he likes me the way I am.
He understands me.

990
01:31:06.701 --> 01:31:10.503
He gets it. He thinks that it's
great that I am so clear

991
01:31:10.569 --> 01:31:14.129
about my communicating and my
feelings and why I want to be –

992
01:31:14.361 --> 01:31:16.661
- Wait. go back. Why?

993
01:31:17.461 --> 01:31:20.461
So you were married before
you came to Melbourne?

994
01:31:23.419 --> 01:31:24.599
- [Julia] Um. yeah.

995
01:31:25.434 --> 01:31:28.738
- And you didn't tell anyone?
- I didn't tell anyone.

996
01:31:29.595 --> 01:31:32.495
I didn't know how to bring it up
with mum and dad and...

997
01:31:33.751 --> 01:31:36.973
I hadn't really seen you in
so long and you were...

998
01:31:38.353 --> 01:31:40.687
I mean you weren't over
joyed when I left –

999
01:31:40.753 --> 01:31:43.377
- [Zara] Yeah.
- [Julia] for New York so I...

1000
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.406
I didn't know how you would take it.

1001
01:31:46.472 --> 01:31:48.652
I didn't know what it would mean.

1002
01:31:50.187 --> 01:31:52.375
- [Julia] Z. I'm sorry that I didn't share.

1003
01:31:52.441 --> 01:31:53.729
- It's fine. it's...

1004
01:31:54.481 --> 01:31:55.866
Congratulations.

1005
01:31:55.932 --> 01:31:57.918
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1006
01:31:58.904 --> 01:32:00.280
- Well. I...

1007
01:32:01.086 --> 01:32:03.319
- So how's it going –
- I don't know.

1008
01:32:03.385 --> 01:32:05.783
- This married life?
- I don't know how married life is going.

1009
01:32:05.849 --> 01:32:08.379
I don't know because he's
not really talking to me.

1010
01:32:11.031 --> 01:32:12.263
- Why?

1011
01:32:15.501 --> 01:32:18.905
- I slept with Henri. In Melbourne and

1012
01:32:18.971 --> 01:32:22.133
I thought that
- Oh my God.

1013
01:32:22.199 --> 01:32:24.653
- Patrick would understand if I...

1014
01:32:25.929 --> 01:32:27.929
just told him the truth.

1015
01:32:28.917 --> 01:32:30.000
- Wait.

1016
01:32:30.623 --> 01:32:32.745
- He's not been the same. he's not
been the same for a while.

1017
01:32:32.811 --> 01:32:34.509
And I don't know who
to tell. Who do I tell?

1018
01:32:34.575 --> 01:32:36.279
All my friends are his friends.

1019
01:32:36.345 --> 01:32:39.821
Who do I explain it to. and
what happens if happens again?

1020
01:32:41.851 --> 01:32:44.934
Our deal was that I would always
let him know before I had

1021
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.936
a desire or and I've found someone –

1022
01:32:47.002 --> 01:32:48.769
- Yeah. but you were selfish

1023
01:32:48.835 --> 01:32:51.203
and you decided to get married

1024
01:32:51.269 --> 01:32:53.685
and then come to Melbourne
and sleep with Henri and not tell him –

1025
01:32:53.751 --> 01:32:56.685
- Whoah. whoah. I didn't decide to do that.

1026
01:32:56.751 --> 01:32:59.399
You know that's not how it works.

1027
01:32:59.465 --> 01:33:01.334
- No. I think I do know how it works.

1028
01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.700
You choose to sleep with
somebody. it is a choice.

1029
01:33:03.766 --> 01:33:05.062
- It is not a choice!

1030
01:33:05.128 --> 01:33:07.222
What part of that do you not understand?

1031
01:33:07.570 --> 01:33:08.894
You've never got that.

1032
01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:11.654
You've never like actually stopped to reflect
and to listen to what I am saying ever.

1033
01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:14.122
- Yeah because it's all about what
you're saying and how you're feeling.

1034
01:33:14.188 --> 01:33:16.867
How do you not think about anybody else
in these relationships that you have?

1035
01:33:16.933 --> 01:33:18.933
- Yeah. I'm a selfish
bitch. You're totally right.

1036
01:33:21.917 --> 01:33:23.597
- Well. what does Patrick think of it all?

1037
01:33:25.077 --> 01:33:27.855
- [Julia] I told you. he's not really
communicating with me.

1038
01:33:29.315 --> 01:33:32.409
He hasn't really looked at me properly.

1039
01:33:32.693 --> 01:33:35.573
Like he makes stupid comments about sex.

1040
01:33:35.863 --> 01:33:38.416
God I can't even get a
text message from you

1041
01:33:38.482 --> 01:33:40.251
without him saying something...

1042
01:33:40.317 --> 01:33:42.955
perverse and stupid and...

1043
01:33:44.043 --> 01:33:45.603
I don't know what it means.

1044
01:33:45.951 --> 01:33:48.473
I don't know if we stay together.
I don't know if he'll understand.

1045
01:33:48.539 --> 01:33:52.039
I don't know.

1046
01:33:52.577 --> 01:33:55.119
And I do know that I am gonna want to

1047
01:33:55.185 --> 01:33:57.475
be with someone else at
some point of time. and –

1048
01:33:57.541 --> 01:33:58.827
- So then why did you get married?

1049
01:33:58.893 --> 01:34:01.554
- Because he understood that. he doesn't
have any issue with that. or so he says.

1050
01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:03.494
- Well. obviously he does.

1051
01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:05.719
This is why it doesn't work. Jules.

1052
01:34:05.785 --> 01:34:07.600
I have told you this so many times.

1053
01:34:07.666 --> 01:34:09.739
I get it. I get it. I get it.

1054
01:34:09.805 --> 01:34:12.714
I just don't understand
how you don't understand.

1055
01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:14.264
- I do understand.

1056
01:34:14.612 --> 01:34:17.262
I understand that I should have
told him before it happened.

1057
01:34:17.328 --> 01:34:20.972
I understand that it happened organically
because we have a connection.

1058
01:34:21.038 --> 01:34:23.836
And that is who I am
and it's to follow that.

1059
01:34:23.902 --> 01:34:25.545
- It's not who you are.

1060
01:34:25.611 --> 01:34:27.865
- I get that you are so
loving and generous –

1061
01:34:27.931 --> 01:34:32.815
- It's not about being loving. it's about choosing
my sexual consent and the people I am with.

1062
01:34:32.881 --> 01:34:36.052
- Exactly. Choosing. It's a choice
that you are making.

1063
01:34:36.118 --> 01:34:38.209
I just think you are kidding yourself.

1064
01:34:38.847 --> 01:34:40.827
I just think you are lying. I think that

1065
01:34:41.541 --> 01:34:43.083
when you are in a
relationship with somebody.

1066
01:34:43.149 --> 01:34:46.083
there is this vulnerability
that you need to have.

1067
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:48.905
which is just so precious and beautiful.

1068
01:34:48.971 --> 01:34:51.544
And when you jeopardise that. Jules.

1069
01:34:51.892 --> 01:34:54.323
all the time. It just...

1070
01:34:55.570 --> 01:34:57.398
I just don't get it.
