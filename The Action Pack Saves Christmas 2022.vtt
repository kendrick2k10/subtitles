<i>We are the Action Pack!</i>

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.833
All right!

-We've got it!
-Plant-tastic!

18
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.958
Come on. let's go!

19

Perfect.

20
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.708
Plasma-powered prettying.

21
00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:05.625
And I'll light the menorah.

22
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.958
Mission accomplished!

23
00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:11.208
-Yeah!
-All right!

24
00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.541
Feliz Navidad!

25

Look at all these presents!

26
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:23.208
Nothing's better than
a grizzly-bear-big stack of presents

27
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:24.875
with your name on them.

28
00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.291
Hot Sparks!

29
00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:27.750
Is this one for me?

30
00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:28.666
Yeppers.

31
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.833
I had so much fun making Hanukkah presents
when we celebrated with you. Watts.

32
00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:35.791
that I made Christmas presents
for everyone too.

33
00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:39.291
Oh. holidays make me
hamster-hedgehog-hummingbird happy!

34
00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:40.541
Can I open it?

35
00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:43.791
Nuh-uh. Watts.
It's Hope Springs' Christmas tradition

36
00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:46.208
that you don't open gifts
until the gift exchange

37
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:47.875
at the tree lighting ceremony.

38
00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.500
Right. Presents happen
<i>after</i> I help light the tree.

39
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.083
Zip!

40
00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:54.541
Zap!

41
00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:57.708
-Watts!
-The crowd cheers! They chant my name!

42
00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:00.125
-That's me. Thank you.
-Watts!

43
00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:01.791
-Watts!
-Yes?

44
00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:04.166
Light the tree. not the teacher.

45
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.541
Oops! Sorry. Mr Ernesto.

46
00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:13.500
Wow. Action Pack! Mission Decorate
The Action Academy is complete.

Hoodies down. team.

48
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:19.125
You kids are clear
to go to the tree lighting.

49
00:02:19.208 --> 00:02:20.750
Grab your gifts for the exchange.

50
00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:23.250
and I'll be there as soon
as my cookies are done.

51
00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:24.416
Yeah!

52
00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:31.708
<i>Dashing through the snow</i>
<i>In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

<i>Laughing all the way…</i>

54
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.083
Everybody loves winter!

<i>Making spirits bright</i>
<i>What fun it is to…</i>

56
00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:43.500
It's too early for Christmas music!

57
00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:46.625
Oh. Mr Grumpman. it's Christmas Eve!

58
00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.541
Oh. fiddlesticks.

59
00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:51.708
<i>Oh. what fun it is to ride</i>
<i>In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

60
00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:53.041
Ah. Matthew.

61
00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:58.083
As my first toy. you understand that being
the child of a Von Taker toy tycoon

62
00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:00.750
means that I get every toy
made in Hope Springs.

63
00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:06.041
But I. Teddy Von Taker. need more toys.
toys not built in Hope Springs.

64
00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:08.541
And to take them. I need more power.

65
00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:11.833
That's where my
Christmas Cheer-Taker comes in.

66
00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:16.583
Once I get the Christmas cheer.
I'll be ready for Santa tonight.

67
00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:20.416
It's a flurry of white!

68
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.791
There's a kid with Christmas cheer!
Shall we. Matthew?

69
00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:28.958
Time to take the cheer away.

70
00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:31.375
Yay!

71
00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:33.208
Winter!

72
00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:35.875
-Whatever.
-Whatever.

73
00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.416
Whatever.

74
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.750
It's just snow.

75
00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:44.875
It's working! More cheer for me.
less cheer for everyone else!

76
00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.166
<i>Jingle bells…</i>

77
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.083
I'll be taking your cheer too.

78
00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:53.708
<i>Oh. what fun it is to ride</i>
<i>In a one-horse open sleigh. hey!</i>

79
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:55.666
<i>Jingle bells. jingle bells</i>

80
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.833
-Oh. hot dog.
-Let's go.

81
00:03:57.916 --> 00:04:00.291
I don't really feel like singing.

82
00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:05.375
Finally. I can enjoy Christmas in peace.

83
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.333
Why isn't my Cheer-Taker working?

84
00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:18.041
You think you're just
gonna suck out all the cheer

85
00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:21.458
to power up that battery thingamajig?

86
00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:24.000
Well. I don't have any cheer to take!

87
00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:30.125
I say the joke is on you. sir.

88
00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:33.166
You have a little cheer
in there after all.

89
00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:36.750
Oh. fiddlesticks.

90
00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:47.416
More cheer. more power for me!

91
00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:53.875
And then. one Christmas I got an art kit.
and it had paint and glitter and--

92
00:04:56.708 --> 00:04:57.708
Why are they leaving?

93
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:01.000
This Christmas party
isn't looking like a party at all.

94
00:05:01.083 --> 00:05:02.541
Let's see what's going on.

95
00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:08.750
-What's wrong. Cold Snap?
-I don't feel like celebrating. Goodbye.

96
00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:11.791
What? I thought Cold Snap
would love Christmas.

97
00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:13.791
Maybe he celebrates something else?

98
00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:18.625
Well. Hanukkah's all about being with
your family. and kindness. and giving too.

99
00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:22.083
And all of those things make me happy.
so I don't think that's it.

100
00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:24.833
Something strange is going on here.

101
00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:27.833
This place should be bubbling
with Christmas cheer.

102
00:05:27.916 --> 00:05:30.500
<i>Did someone say Christmas cheer?</i>

103
00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:32.375
Teddy Von Taker?!

104
00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:37.208
<i>Why. hello. Action Pack.</i>
<i>You have just the cheer I'm here to take.</i>

105
00:05:37.916 --> 00:05:43.125
Wonderful! The Toy Tycoon
Multi-Purpose Gauntlet is quite handy.

106
00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:45.833
Take our cheer? What does he mean?

107
00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:48.416
I don't know. But we better find out.

108
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.833
Action Pack. circle up. hoodies up. and…

109
00:05:51.916 --> 00:05:53.041
Take action!

110
00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:54.250
<i>Action Pack</i>

111
00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.875
<i>Here we go</i>

112
00:05:58.833 --> 00:06:02.291
Treena. mighty flowers and plant power!

113
00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:06.916
Clay. plasma power and Invinci-ball!

114
00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:12.208
Wren. changing up
with animal powers. Roar!

115
00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:16.583
Watts. supercharged electric zaps!

116
00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:24.916
<i>I'm tired of waiting. Action Pack!</i>

117
00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:26.625
So loud!

118
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:30.416
Oh. pardon me. Microphone off.

119
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.708
I'm just here to take your cheer.

120
00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:35.708
Watch out! Action on. Invinci-ball!

121
00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:37.666
Butterfly Wings!

122
00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.333
Oh Zap!

123
00:06:42.416 --> 00:06:43.583
It's not working!

124
00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:47.333
Hey! Taking people's
Christmas cheer is not nice!

125
00:06:47.416 --> 00:06:49.166
Being all cheery. happy. smiley.

126
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.458
and full of feel-good feels
is what Christmas is all abou--

127
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:53.583
Wren!

128
00:06:53.666 --> 00:06:55.958
Don't worry. I'll stop this.

129
00:06:57.416 --> 00:06:58.458
Electric Blast!

130
00:07:02.041 --> 00:07:05.833
Fully charged and ready
to take for phase two.

131
00:07:06.416 --> 00:07:08.791
-Wren!
-Oh no!

132
00:07:08.875 --> 00:07:13.416
I won't even need the cheer from the rest
of the Action Pack. Ready. Matthew?

133
00:07:14.458 --> 00:07:15.416
Then let's go.

134
00:07:20.916 --> 00:07:23.125
-Are you okay?
-How do you feel?

135
00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:24.416
I'm okay.

136
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.833
I just feel nothing.

137
00:07:27.416 --> 00:07:30.291
Oh no! He actually took
her Christmas cheer.

138
00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:31.791
Why would Teddy do that?

139
00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:36.666
Well. Mr Ernesto did teach us
that Christmas cheer is really powerful.

140
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.791
Oh Zap! With all Wren's cheer.
Teddy Von Taker will be mega-powered!

141
00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:44.291
I think we need a plan of action. Treena?

142
00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:47.333
You got it.
Our mission is to save Christmas.

143
00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:50.000
<i>We have to stop Teddy Von Taker</i>

144
00:07:50.083 --> 00:07:53.375
<i>from doing whatever he plans</i>
<i>to do with that cheer power.</i>

145
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.166
<i>Then we need to figure out</i>
<i>how to get the cheer out of that battery</i>

146
00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.750
<i>and back into the people.</i>

147
00:08:00.541 --> 00:08:02.125
<i>Then I'll light up the tree!</i>

148
00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:04.500
<i>That is a plan.</i>

149
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:07.333
Action on!

150
00:08:07.416 --> 00:08:08.875
Action on.

151
00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.041
I guess.

152
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.875
Hold it right there. Teddy Von Taker.

153
00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.041
Bye!

154
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.583
Give that cheer back. or I'll--

155
00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:20.500
Hot Sparks!

156
00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:24.833
Is that really an UltraFly Zoom Board 2.0?
Can I try it?

157
00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:29.125
Actually. it's the 3.0 version
with advanced agility.

158
00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:31.916
Bye!

159
00:08:38.791 --> 00:08:39.916
-What?
-Gotcha!

160
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.833
Yeah!

161
00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:46.708
Release the penguins!

162
00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:57.041
Watch out!

163
00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:58.833
Distract those heroes by…

164
00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:03.083
destroying that Christmas tree!

165
00:09:06.208 --> 00:09:07.583
Don't hurt the tree!

166
00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:12.291
Petal-copter Power!

167
00:09:12.875 --> 00:09:15.916
If they destroy the tree.
then I won't be able to light it.

168
00:09:17.083 --> 00:09:18.875
Penguins. Meh.

169
00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:23.250
Wren! Invinci-ball!

170
00:09:26.208 --> 00:09:28.875
Invinci-ball. How unexpected.

171
00:09:30.333 --> 00:09:32.166
Petal Flurry!

172
00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:39.125
This tree is under our protection.

173
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:46.875
Not the presents!

174
00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:49.583
Electric Trail!

175
00:09:52.041 --> 00:09:53.375
Oh yeah!

176
00:09:53.916 --> 00:09:55.916
-All right!
-Way to grow. buds.

177
00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:03.000
-No!
-Invinci-ball!

178
00:10:04.833 --> 00:10:08.125
-What do we do?
-There are too many penguins!

179
00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:11.708
Do you hear that?

180
00:10:15.416 --> 00:10:16.375
What is that?

181
00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:18.708
Penguins!

182
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.791
You're on my naughty list.

183
00:10:46.791 --> 00:10:51.208
Super Santa and Striker are here
to save Christmas!

184
00:10:51.291 --> 00:10:55.875
-Incredible!
-Santa Claus is a superhero?

185
00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.458
Santa. That's nice.

186
00:10:57.541 --> 00:10:59.708
Action Pack. I brought cookies!

187
00:11:00.416 --> 00:11:01.458
Santa?!

188
00:11:01.541 --> 00:11:02.666
I know who you are.

189
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:07.541
Ernesto Action. top of the nice list
for the past 27 years.

190
00:11:08.416 --> 00:11:10.458
Meet my reindeer. Striker.

191
00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:18.708
Action Pack. I was out delivering presents

192
00:11:18.791 --> 00:11:21.375
when I received a red and green alert
on the naughty list

193
00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:26.041
that Hope Springs' Christmas cheer
was taken by Teddy Von Taker.

194
00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:29.541
Well. I'm here to get that cheer back.

195
00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:32.500
What do you think
he's trying to do with the cheer. Santa?

196
00:11:32.583 --> 00:11:36.791
Well. I don't know. You see.
Christmas cheer is usually used for good.

197
00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:40.166
helping others. spreading joy. giving.

198
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:44.750
But the raw power of Christmas cheer
can also be used for bad.

199
00:11:44.833 --> 00:11:46.916
It could power
all sorts of villain devices.

200
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.916
I have to save Christmas!

201
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.458
Excuse me. Super Santa. sir.

202
00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:53.333
I mean. Mr Claus.

203
00:11:53.416 --> 00:11:57.166
-Your mission is our mission too.
-And we'd love to help.

204
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:02.916
Well. Santa always needs
a few little helpers. that's for sure.

205
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.333
But first. we must get Wren
feeling like her cheerful self again.

206
00:12:07.416 --> 00:12:11.791
And to fill her full of Christmas cheer.
we'll need her presents.

207
00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:16.333
Presents! This one's for Wren!
And that one!

208
00:12:17.083 --> 00:12:19.083
You misunderstood. Watts.

209
00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:20.916
Getting presents is great.

210
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.125
but the quickest way to gain
Christmas cheer is by giving.

211
00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:28.833
Hey. Wren. get the present
you bought for Clay.

212
00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:31.083
Okay. if you say so.

213
00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:33.875
For you. Clay.

214
00:12:34.708 --> 00:12:39.750
<i>The Exciting Adventures of Clay.</i>
Wow. you made a comic for me?

215
00:12:39.833 --> 00:12:41.916
It's my favourite present.

216
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.958
Thanks. Wren!

217
00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:47.083
And one for Treena.

218
00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:49.166
A flower pot!

219
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.583
I painted the flowers just for you.

220
00:12:51.666 --> 00:12:52.750
Thank you. Wren!

221
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.208
-And the last one is for Watts.
-Yes!

222
00:12:57.291 --> 00:13:01.166
Hot Sparks! You made a drawing of me
with the Crimson Cape?

223
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.541
We look so cool! Can I get a hug. Wren?

224
00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:06.083
Abso-toucan-lutely!

225
00:13:07.291 --> 00:13:08.250
Group hug!

226
00:13:09.666 --> 00:13:10.583
Santa?

227
00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:15.291
Santa's here! Are you ready
to save Christmas? 'Cause I am!

228
00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:19.375
Hi. Striker. I want to hear
all about being a reindeer.

229
00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:21.291
Yeah? Really?

230
00:13:22.916 --> 00:13:25.416
Wow. I didn't understand a word you said.

231
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.458
'cause I don't speak reindeer.
but I love the way you snort.

232
00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:32.291
-What?
-Ah. Mr Ernesto. welcome back.

233
00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:34.166
I'll need you to run Mission Control

234
00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.375
while we go to Teddy's hideout
to wait for him.

235
00:13:36.458 --> 00:13:41.041
Me? Mission Control for you?
The big guy in the red suit?!

236
00:13:41.791 --> 00:13:44.166
I'd be honoured. sir! Come on. Plunky!

237
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.833
Action Pack. be smart.
be safe. be superheroes!

238
00:13:48.916 --> 00:13:49.916
Action on!

239
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:56.291
For Hanukkah. we celebrate eight nights.
and we get presents every night.

240
00:13:56.375 --> 00:13:58.791
Oh. that sounds amazing. Watts.

241
00:13:58.875 --> 00:14:03.250
Lighting the way. you say.
That reminds me of someone else.

242
00:14:04.666 --> 00:14:05.750
There he is!

243
00:14:09.708 --> 00:14:13.333
See. Matthew? Everything is working out
just according to--

244
00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:15.041
Teddy Von Taker!

245
00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:20.541
Hello. Santa. Isn't it a bit early
for you to be in Hope Springs?

246
00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:23.416
It is. but he was alerted
because of what you did.

247
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.083
and now we're here to stop you.

248
00:14:25.166 --> 00:14:28.791
I'm taking this cheer and returning it
to the people of Hope Springs.

249
00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:29.708
Sure.

250
00:14:29.791 --> 00:14:32.916
But first. won't you join me for a snack?

251
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.041
Milk and cookies?

252
00:14:39.583 --> 00:14:41.708
Milk and cookies!

253
00:14:41.791 --> 00:14:42.625
-Santa!
-No!

254
00:14:42.708 --> 00:14:44.875
-It's a trap!
-Don't do it!

255
00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:48.000
-Santa. stop!
-Milk and cookies!

256
00:14:48.083 --> 00:14:50.041
The Invinci-ball is breaking!

257
00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:55.750
-We'll do it together. old sport.
-Cookies.

258
00:14:57.041 --> 00:14:58.458
Cookies.

259
00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.708
-A force field!
-Leaping lemurs!

260
00:15:03.458 --> 00:15:05.125
-No!
-We're trapped!

261
00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:09.791
What happened?

262
00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:11.916
Oh no. milk and cookies!

263
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.875
My only weakness.

264
00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:18.458
The Christmas cheer
powering this force field

265
00:15:18.541 --> 00:15:23.500
is more powerful than even you.
my ho-hoing chum. so you can't escape.

266
00:15:23.583 --> 00:15:27.416
And now to take my prize!

267
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.583
No!

268
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.291
Santa's cape!
Everything I ever wanted to take is here.

269
00:15:34.375 --> 00:15:38.875
-Wow. I guess Teddy really likes capes.
-He knows. But how?

270
00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.666
Allow me to explain.

271
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.500
I have every toy
Hope Springs has to offer.

272
00:15:43.583 --> 00:15:48.791
What I don't have is every toy
from the North Pole. and I want them all!

273
00:15:48.875 --> 00:15:50.583
I tried taking some last year.

274
00:15:51.166 --> 00:15:52.875
<i>It was Christmas Eve.</i>

275
00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:58.291
<i>I placed my spy in the Action Academy.</i>
<i>where those heroes would get their gifts.</i>

276
00:15:58.375 --> 00:16:01.041
<i>That's when I saw</i>
<i>that the cape was the bag.</i>

277
00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:03.125
<i>and that the bag was a portal</i>

278
00:16:03.208 --> 00:16:06.375
<i>connected directly</i>
<i>to the North Pole Workshop.</i>

279
00:16:06.458 --> 00:16:07.833
Santa's Workshop.

280
00:16:07.916 --> 00:16:12.333
would you mind getting me a super snuggly
snuggle bug for Wren Reyes. please?

281
00:16:13.083 --> 00:16:17.916
<i>Any toy that the holder of the bag</i>
<i>asked for would appear in the bag.</i>

282
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.291
<i>I wasn't able to take it last Christmas.</i>

283
00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:23.083
because I wasn't powerful enough
to trap Santa.

284
00:16:23.166 --> 00:16:25.333
That's where the Christmas cheer came in.

285
00:16:25.416 --> 00:16:28.791
Now every North Pole toy will be mine!

286
00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:33.000
Attention. Santa's Workshop.
I'll take a toy car.

287
00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:37.250
Yes. it worked! I'll take another car.

288
00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:39.416
And another car!

289
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.583
And another!

290
00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.833
Boy. he really likes cars.

291
00:16:42.916 --> 00:16:45.875
I think we're going to need
more help than that. Striker.

292
00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.083
I can help. Action on. Polar Bear!

293
00:16:49.666 --> 00:16:50.583
Polar Bear!

294
00:16:51.083 --> 00:16:55.041
Oh no! I think the Cheer-Taker
messed with my animal powers.

295
00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:57.416
Mr Ernesto will be able to help us.

296
00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.125
Mr Ernesto. come in.

297
00:16:59.208 --> 00:17:02.666
Treena. what's wrong?
Is Santa okay? Can he hear me?

298
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:07.250
Yes. he can hear you.
And no. we're not okay.

299
00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:10.125
We're trapped inside
a Christmas cheer-powered force field.

300
00:17:10.208 --> 00:17:13.250
Oh no! I'm scanning the design
through your insignia.

301
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:18.333
And another car! And another!

302
00:17:18.416 --> 00:17:20.875
Got it.
If it works the way I think it does.

303
00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.000
the only way to deactivate the force field

304
00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:25.375
is to press the red button
on the power dock.

305
00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:28.041
Maybe I can reach it.

306
00:17:28.125 --> 00:17:30.916
Plasma Putty Stretch!

307
00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.416
It's too far.

308
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.333
and I can't quite push it.

309
00:17:35.416 --> 00:17:40.125
If I could just change into a tiny mouse.
I could fit through!

310
00:17:40.208 --> 00:17:43.541
Action on. Tiny Mouse!

311
00:17:44.416 --> 00:17:49.125
Wren. you are one of the best
gift-givers I have ever met.

312
00:17:49.208 --> 00:17:53.625
I bet if you think of your powers
as a gift you can give to Hope Springs.

313
00:17:54.125 --> 00:17:55.583
you'll be able to do it.

314
00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:57.375
You're silly. Santa.

315
00:17:57.458 --> 00:18:01.125
It's not a gift. There's no way
to put it in a pretty box and wrap it.

316
00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:05.791
Gifts don't have to be things
you can hold in your hands.

317
00:18:05.875 --> 00:18:09.458
Some of the best gifts
are something you do for someone.

318
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:10.500
Okay.

319
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.208
Action on. Tiny Mouse!

320
00:18:13.833 --> 00:18:15.333
Tiny Mouse!

321
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.875
A gift for Hope Springs.

322
00:18:19.708 --> 00:18:22.041
Action on. Tiny Mouse!

323
00:18:26.125 --> 00:18:27.250
It worked!

324
00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:29.666
-Plant-tastic!
-Hot Sparks!

325
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.916
I'll shut off that battery
before you can say duck-billed platypus!

326
00:18:37.791 --> 00:18:40.208
Being itty-bitty is mega-biggie dangerous.

327
00:18:41.541 --> 00:18:45.750
Where did this bear come from?
And I can't go big. or Teddy will see me.

328
00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:48.125
Attention. Santa's Workshop.

329
00:18:48.208 --> 00:18:52.000
My dear Matthew has requested more bears.

330
00:19:00.625 --> 00:19:02.083
Bad car!

331
00:19:07.708 --> 00:19:09.458
Good car!

332
00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:25.541
-Yeah!
-Great job. Wren!

333
00:19:29.416 --> 00:19:31.083
Push!

334
00:19:31.166 --> 00:19:32.125
You!

335
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.791
Action on. Sneaky Fox!

336
00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:37.708
Action on. Cheetah? Action on. anything?

337
00:19:38.541 --> 00:19:42.000
My animal powers aren't working again!
And I'm stuck as a mouse!

338
00:19:42.083 --> 00:19:43.541
Santa's Workshop.

339
00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:48.125
I need something that will take this
meddling rodent far away from that button.

340
00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:50.708
How about some Taker Tots?

341
00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:54.875
<i>-Take.</i>
<i>-Take.</i>

342
00:19:59.083 --> 00:20:00.041
Wren. look out!

343
00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:01.833
Oh no!

344
00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:09.750
<i>-Take!</i>
<i>-Take!</i>

345
00:20:14.166 --> 00:20:17.333
Wren. a gift for Hope Springs!

346
00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:21.333
This is my gift for Hope Springs.

347
00:20:22.333 --> 00:20:23.250
Action on.

348
00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:26.000
Polar Bear Arms!

349
00:20:29.125 --> 00:20:30.041
I did it!

350

Plunky and I have already planned out
the perfect delivery route

so you can get all the presents
out on time.

Excellent Mission Controlling. you two.

402
00:23:42.833 --> 00:23:45.958

until we light the tree.

403
00:23:46.041 --> 00:23:47.791
