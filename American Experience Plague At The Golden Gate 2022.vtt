5
00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:32.480
January 20. 1900.

6
00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:36.139
The skies above Oahu
were black with smoke.

7
00:00:39.073 --> 00:00:41.110
Bubonic plague had been discovered

8
00:00:41.144 --> 00:00:43.871
in Honolulu's Chinatown

9
00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:47.633
and panicked health officials
were doing everything they could

10
00:00:47.668 --> 00:00:51.810
to try to stop the spread.

11
00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:55.607
In those
days. they didn't really understand

12
00:00:55.641 --> 00:01:00.163
how plague was transmitted.
so the public health approach

13
00:01:00.198 --> 00:01:01.578
was isolate people.

14
00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:05.134
They would wall off a whole area
with police and checkpoints

15
00:01:05.168 --> 00:01:07.619
and wouldn't let anybody in or out.

16
00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:08.930
But if they couldn't stop the problem.

17
00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:11.209
they would often do targeted
burnings of buildings.

18
00:01:13.418 --> 00:01:14.729
Their point of view is.

19
00:01:14.764 --> 00:01:16.214
you know. "We don't care what you do.

20
00:01:16.248 --> 00:01:17.870
"If you have to burn the place down.

21
00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:20.321
just make sure that you contain
this epidemic."

22
00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:25.878
Desperate
residents fled their burning homes

23
00:01:25.913 --> 00:01:29.296
as the fire spiraled out of control.

24
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.197
And mobs of white residents stood by

25
00:01:34.232 --> 00:01:38.960
with clubs and revolvers...
threatening to kill any Asian

26
00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:43.482
who tried to skirt the exit lane
out of the quarantine zone.

27
00:01:48.798 --> 00:01:52.733
This is the Black
Plague of the Middle Ages that wiped out

28
00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:54.286
one-third of the population in Europe.

29
00:01:56.426 --> 00:01:59.878
So. we have this sense
if it wasn't stopped.

30
00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:02.363
the consequences would be unbearable.

31
00:02:06.505 --> 00:02:09.129
The fires burned for 17 days

32
00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:12.787
and left nearly all of Chinatown in ashes.

33
00:02:12.822 --> 00:02:16.964
4.500 of its residents were homeless.

34
00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:22.901
The most feared disease in history.

35
00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:27.043
bubonic plague. was an unsolved mystery.

36
00:02:27.077 --> 00:02:30.598
It had decimated the populations
of Europe and North Africa

37
00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:35.189
in two separate pandemics
over hundreds of years.

38
00:02:35.224 --> 00:02:38.951
and the third was now raging across Asia.

39
00:02:41.782 --> 00:02:43.611
This was the start of the steamship era.

40
00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:45.475
So now disease and people and goods

41
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.272
can travel around the world
incredibly quickly.

42
00:02:49.307 --> 00:02:53.966
And the bubonic plague
spreads along Hong Kong.

43
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.245
spreads to Japan. it spreads to India.

44
00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:57.936
and millions of people start dying.

45
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:03.942
At that time. there was still
a medieval sense of what

46
00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:05.185
this disease was

47
00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.807
and how it was spread.

48
00:03:06.841 --> 00:03:10.466
Many people thought it was
"miasma"... bad air...

49
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.193
or it was simply a disease of filth.

50
00:03:16.023 --> 00:03:18.439
Other people thought that
this is only a disease

51
00:03:18.474 --> 00:03:20.338
of rice eaters.

52
00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:32.384
Racism
and ignorance were already in the air

53
00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.043
as the bubonic plague made its
silent way across the Pacific.

54
00:03:38.597 --> 00:03:43.395
It would arrive in North America
for the first time in history

55
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.883
where it would spark nationwide
terror. denial. and blame.

56
00:03:51.886 --> 00:03:54.751
Two men would try to stop it.

57
00:03:54.786 --> 00:03:58.134
struggling with not only
the scientific unknowns.

58
00:03:58.168 --> 00:04:04.244
but unanticipated forces of
politics. commerce. and race.

59
00:04:47.183 --> 00:04:51.221
June 28. 1899:

60
00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:55.225
in the cold morning fog.
a lone Italian crab fisherman

61
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.883
made an unsettling discovery.

62
00:04:59.368 --> 00:05:03.648
Two bodies were floating
face down in San Francisco Bay.

63
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:11.897
The previous morning.
the Japanese steamship

64
00:05:11.932 --> 00:05:16.488
the Nippon Maru had arrived
in San Francisco from Hong Kong.

65
00:05:16.523 --> 00:05:20.734
stopping at Shanghai. Yokohama.
and then Honolulu.

66
00:05:24.047 --> 00:05:28.293
Ominously. she flew a yellow flag:

67
00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:31.365
the international signal
indicating disease.

68
00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:41.962
When the Nippon
Maru entered San Francisco Bay.

69
00:05:41.996 --> 00:05:43.895
two stowaways.

70
00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:46.967
who evidently were ill. jumped overboard

71
00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:48.486
into the bay waters.

72
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.695
And when their bodies were recovered.

73
00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.802
the local doctors found them
to be suspicious.

74
00:05:56.632 --> 00:05:59.600
Unnerved by both their autopsy findings

75
00:05:59.635 --> 00:06:03.017
and recent reports of plague in Asia.

76
00:06:03.052 --> 00:06:05.468
the city doctors immediately
sent their results

77
00:06:05.503 --> 00:06:09.645
to Joseph Kinyoun. the nation's
foremost plague authority.

78
00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:12.958
and the newly appointed head
of the Marine Hospital Service

79
00:06:12.993 --> 00:06:16.341
on nearby Angel Island.

80
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.689
Angel Island in San Francisco Bay

81
00:06:19.724 --> 00:06:22.899
had a quarantine station
where cargoes and passengers

82
00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:26.696
were checked for all kinds of
disease by the doctors

83
00:06:26.731 --> 00:06:29.527
of the Marine Hospital Service.

84
00:06:31.494 --> 00:06:34.324
The Marine Hospital
Service had been established

85
00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:37.569
30 years earlier to treat sick seamen.

86
00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:43.333
But the idea of "public health"
had since evolved into a matter

87
00:06:43.368 --> 00:06:45.301
of national concern.

88
00:06:48.338 --> 00:06:52.757
The MHS was now charged with
fighting the spread of epidemics

89
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:56.416
using federal powers of
quarantine and surveillance.

90
00:06:59.867 --> 00:07:02.801
Their main responsibility
was protecting the people

91
00:07:02.836 --> 00:07:04.769
of the United States

92
00:07:04.803 --> 00:07:06.667
from the spread of disease
around the world.

93
00:07:06.702 --> 00:07:09.394
So. there were Marine Hospital
Service officers stationed

94
00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.845
in Rome. in London. in Asia.

95
00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:16.712
Just weeks into his posting.

96
00:07:16.746 --> 00:07:20.854
Kinyoun knew better than anyone
that hospitals around the world

97
00:07:20.888 --> 00:07:24.892
were reporting 90% death rates
from the plague.

98
00:07:24.927 --> 00:07:27.999
And that millions had already
perished from a pandemic

99
00:07:28.033 --> 00:07:33.349
that had been raging since the 1850s.

100
00:07:33.383 --> 00:07:35.316
Although no one knew why.

101
00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:40.494
rats and filth had long been
associated with plague.

102
00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:44.498
Kinyoun ordered the
Nippon Maru to be disinfected

103
00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:47.501
and checked for vermin before
having all 55 passengers

104
00:07:47.536 --> 00:07:49.399
quarantined on Angel Island.

105
00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:57.442
Then he faced
the most critical step of all:

106
00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:00.825
determining how the men had died.

107
00:08:05.692 --> 00:08:07.970
Kinyoun suspected plague.

108
00:08:08.004 --> 00:08:10.075
And there was a little rattle
in the papers.

109
00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:20.327
Well. Kinyoun thought the bodies
were too far gone.

110
00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:26.402
There wasn't definitive proof.

111
00:08:26.436 --> 00:08:28.093
So the press kind of backed away.

112
00:08:28.128 --> 00:08:30.510
Kinyoun backed away.
and everybody backed away.

113
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.965
A positive diagnosis would be calamitous.

114
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.348
But the condition of the tissue
samples and decomposed bodies

115
00:08:41.382 --> 00:08:44.800
made forensic confirmation impossible.

116
00:08:46.698 --> 00:08:50.184
Without scientific proof.
Kinyoun could not assert

117
00:08:50.219 --> 00:08:53.360
that plague had arrived.

118
00:08:53.394 --> 00:08:56.328
Yet his years of
rigorous training had taught him

119
00:08:56.363 --> 00:09:00.505
to remain alert.

120
00:09:11.136 --> 00:09:14.277
Joseph Kinyoun was a star.

121
00:09:14.312 --> 00:09:17.626
He was beautifully educated.

122
00:09:19.144 --> 00:09:23.597
He had studied with the best
scientists in the world

123
00:09:23.632 --> 00:09:27.359
to learn the state-of-the-art methods

124
00:09:27.394 --> 00:09:30.328
of diagnosing infectious diseases.

125
00:09:32.848 --> 00:09:35.195
Then. at the age of 27.

126
00:09:35.229 --> 00:09:39.130
while he was at the
Hygienic Laboratory in New York.

127
00:09:39.164 --> 00:09:42.133
he diagnosed the first case

128
00:09:42.167 --> 00:09:46.447
of cholera with the new
bacteriologic tests

129
00:09:46.482 --> 00:09:48.622
in the Western Hemisphere.

130
00:09:48.657 --> 00:09:53.523
He was truly the elite
of American scientists.

131
00:09:56.665 --> 00:10:01.497
But Kinyoun's meteoric
rise was interrupted by personal tragedy.

132
00:10:05.674 --> 00:10:09.505
Joe and Elizabeth
Kinyoun's daughter died of diphtheria

133
00:10:09.539 --> 00:10:13.405
at the age of three.

134
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.339
It's a terrible disease to die from.

135
00:10:16.374 --> 00:10:18.445
and it must be devastating for a parent.

136
00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:26.315
Diphtheria at the time
was one of the most devastating

137
00:10:26.349 --> 00:10:28.869
childhood diseases.

138
00:10:28.904 --> 00:10:33.046
So. Kinyoun goes to Germany
to work with Robert Koch.

139
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.878
who had discovered these cures
for diphtheria.

140
00:10:37.913 --> 00:10:40.570
And he can't believe his own eyes.

141
00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:43.643
seeing these kids recover as if by magic.

142
00:10:43.677 --> 00:10:44.747
And he can't help but believe

143
00:10:44.782 --> 00:10:46.162
that he's seeing his own daughter's face

144
00:10:46.197 --> 00:10:47.543
on all of these children.

145
00:10:47.577 --> 00:10:49.890
And that really gives him
this idea that medicine

146
00:10:49.925 --> 00:10:51.098
can conquer anything.

147
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.658
Kinyoun was fueled
by not just a new sense of purpose

148
00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:01.695
but of possibility.

149
00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:08.702
Joseph James Kinyoun.

150
00:11:08.737 --> 00:11:10.704
he was a very unique guy
from the day he set foot

151
00:11:10.739 --> 00:11:11.843
in the Marine Hospital Service.

152
00:11:11.878 --> 00:11:15.191
He was fascinated by technology.

153
00:11:15.226 --> 00:11:17.400
He taught himself photography
and radiology.

154
00:11:17.435 --> 00:11:21.335
which was a new technique around
the turn of the century.

155
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.751
He was an inventor.

156
00:11:22.785 --> 00:11:26.547
And he invented an enormous
number of machines and devices

157
00:11:26.582 --> 00:11:30.172
to steam sterilize. for example.
or chemically sterilize.

158
00:11:30.206 --> 00:11:32.830
Any new technique.
he was just in love with

159
00:11:32.864 --> 00:11:35.418
and he wanted to master it.

160
00:11:35.453 --> 00:11:38.421
He was an early adopter of ideas.

161
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:45.187
The 39-year old scientist
had already proven himself a leader

162
00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:47.983
in the fledgling fields of microbiology

163
00:11:48.017 --> 00:11:49.709
and infectious diseases.

164
00:11:52.677 --> 00:11:56.267
Once in D.C.. Kinyoun developed
the Hygienic Laboratory

165
00:11:56.301 --> 00:11:59.442
into a national state-of-the-art
research center.

166
00:11:59.477 --> 00:12:02.860
which supported the MHS
by identifying diseases

167
00:12:02.894 --> 00:12:06.726
and controlling epidemic outbreaks.

168
00:12:10.246 --> 00:12:15.251
Dr. Joseph Kinyoun
loved the National Hygienic Lab.

169
00:12:15.286 --> 00:12:19.083
He and his young family loved
the finer East Coast living

170
00:12:19.117 --> 00:12:23.087
and the cream of scientific
society in Washington D.C.

171
00:12:26.297 --> 00:12:28.575
However. Walter Wyman.

172
00:12:28.609 --> 00:12:31.889
the surgeon general of the
Marine Hospital Service.

173
00:12:31.923 --> 00:12:34.684
his eye was on the West Coast.

174
00:12:34.719 --> 00:12:35.962
where he feared plague would be entering

175
00:12:35.996 --> 00:12:39.310
and he transferred
the young Joseph Kinyoun

176
00:12:39.344 --> 00:12:44.729
to San Francisco to run the
Angel Island quarantine station.

177
00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:51.805
And. of course. Kinyoun was not
pleased about being dispatched

178
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.878
to what he thought was this
frontier outpost.

179
00:12:55.913 --> 00:13:00.296
The MHS quarantine station on Angel Island

180
00:13:00.331 --> 00:13:05.094
in the middle of San Francisco
Bay was a jumble of filthy

181
00:13:05.129 --> 00:13:06.751
and neglected buildings.

182
00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.584
Kinyoun now had to contend
with a workplace

183
00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:16.416
that was completely unsuitable
to the urgent task at hand...

184
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.040
protecting the nation
from a deadly epidemic.

185
00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:26.150
The Marine Hospital Service

186
00:13:26.184 --> 00:13:28.808
was a uniform branch
of the United States government.

187
00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:33.329
And Kinyoun himself.
he's a very military guy.

188
00:13:33.364 --> 00:13:36.470
He always followed orders.
and he did what he was told.

189
00:13:36.505 --> 00:13:37.851
and didn't complain about it.

190
00:13:37.886 --> 00:13:39.853
He was clearly the best man for the job.

191
00:13:39.888 --> 00:13:41.234
He probably knew that.

192
00:13:41.268 --> 00:13:45.410
So. as everything else.
he threw himself into it 100%.

193
00:13:48.586 --> 00:13:51.865
From the moment
Kinyoun assumed his post in California.

194
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.490
he had been on high alert for plague.

195
00:13:56.525 --> 00:14:01.254
San Francisco was not only the
busiest port on the West Coast.

196
00:14:01.288 --> 00:14:05.051
but connected by rail
to the rest of the country.

197
00:14:05.085 --> 00:14:09.883
It was terrifyingly well-placed
to spread disease far and wide.

198
00:14:13.093 --> 00:14:16.856
To miss even a single diagnosis
could be cataclysmic.

199
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.622
Joseph Kinyoun is really intent

200
00:14:24.656 --> 00:14:28.868
on checking every ship from Asia.

201
00:14:31.284 --> 00:14:36.013
Because after bubonic plague
emerges in Honolulu.

202
00:14:36.047 --> 00:14:39.223
and is discovered in the Chinese quarter.

203
00:14:39.257 --> 00:14:42.951
it becomes kind of a confirmation bias.

204
00:14:42.985 --> 00:14:46.023
It was only going to affect
Chinese people.

205
00:14:46.057 --> 00:14:49.336
That one could contain it in some way.

206
00:14:49.371 --> 00:14:50.890
And that set up

207
00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:52.995
a terrible dynamic.

208
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.723
It only percolated more fear.
more confusion.

209
00:14:56.757 --> 00:14:58.138
more misunderstanding.

210
00:14:58.173 --> 00:15:03.523
And all eyes were targeted on
a Chinese source.

211
00:15:23.888 --> 00:15:25.717
As the 20th century dawned.

212
00:15:25.752 --> 00:15:28.065
everyone celebrated.

213
00:15:30.136 --> 00:15:34.519
And no place had more optimistic
swagger than San Francisco.

214
00:15:37.315 --> 00:15:40.249
It was home to one
out of every four people

215
00:15:40.284 --> 00:15:42.251
who lived west of the Rockies.

216
00:15:44.012 --> 00:15:46.566
A third of the nation's money
west of the Mississippi

217
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.844
flowed through her banks.

218
00:15:48.878 --> 00:15:53.676
The city was a trading hub.
the portal to the east.

219
00:15:53.711 --> 00:15:56.990
and the diamond in the crown
of a state already rich

220
00:15:57.025 --> 00:15:58.958
with natural resources.

221
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.964
It truly was the city of the future.

222
00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.348
As a Gold Rush boom town.

223
00:16:10.383 --> 00:16:13.489
San Francisco had new money.

224
00:16:13.524 --> 00:16:16.009
It had three opera houses.

225
00:16:16.044 --> 00:16:20.255
railroad and mining tycoons
living in palaces on Nob Hill.

226
00:16:20.289 --> 00:16:23.879
and a new cable car system.

227
00:16:25.639 --> 00:16:30.437
San Francisco in 1900 aspired to be

228
00:16:30.472 --> 00:16:32.784
the Paris of the Pacific coast.

229
00:16:37.237 --> 00:16:40.378
Nearly six percent
of the city's population lived in

230
00:16:40.413 --> 00:16:45.038
a 12-block district.

231
00:16:45.073 --> 00:16:49.042
Chinatown is home and it always will be.

232
00:16:49.077 --> 00:16:50.457
My mother was born in the year 1900

233
00:16:50.492 --> 00:16:53.805
in San Francisco's Chinatown.

234
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.844
And she lived in Chinatown
throughout her entire life.

235
00:16:57.878 --> 00:17:00.433
Because they didn't have any choices.

236
00:17:00.467 --> 00:17:06.439
They were not permitted to move
outside of the neighborhood.

237
00:17:06.473 --> 00:17:09.718
Things were red lined.
there was discrimination.

238
00:17:09.752 --> 00:17:11.961
and people were very stereotyped.

239
00:17:15.172 --> 00:17:18.623
Chinatowns primarily
exist because Chinese weren't allowed

240
00:17:18.658 --> 00:17:22.110
to live in white neighborhoods
or any other neighborhood.

241
00:17:27.115 --> 00:17:30.014
They are what sociologists call
ethnic enclaves.

242
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:33.397
where people like to live with
people who speak their language.

243
00:17:33.431 --> 00:17:37.884
or eat similar foods.
or practice the same religion.

244
00:17:37.918 --> 00:17:41.991
But they're also confining.

245
00:17:42.026 --> 00:17:47.204
So. Chinatowns are a combination
of ethnic solidarity

246
00:17:47.238 --> 00:17:50.724
and discrimination and exclusion.

247
00:17:59.008 --> 00:18:04.117
As the Year of the
Rat dawned on January 31. 1900.

248
00:18:04.152 --> 00:18:09.122
shop owners in Chinatown began
noticing a disturbing sight:

249
00:18:09.157 --> 00:18:10.813
rat carcasses littered

250
00:18:10.848 --> 00:18:12.781
the district's alleys and courtyards.

251
00:18:16.612 --> 00:18:20.202
And for 41-year-old Wong Chut King.

252
00:18:20.237 --> 00:18:23.447
something was definitely wrong.

253
00:18:23.481 --> 00:18:25.414
A worker in a nearby lumber yard.

254
00:18:25.449 --> 00:18:30.039
Wong lived in the Globe Hotel
on DuPont Avenue.

255
00:18:30.074 --> 00:18:32.490
the main artery of Chinatown.

256
00:18:38.738 --> 00:18:41.258
He shared one bed with two other men.

257
00:18:41.292 --> 00:18:45.331
They'd take turns sleeping.

258
00:18:45.365 --> 00:18:48.679
It was really a meager existence
of survival.

259
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.098
He. like many people who came from China.

260
00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:55.272
expected their time

261
00:18:55.306 --> 00:18:57.619
in San Francisco to be short-lived.

262
00:18:57.653 --> 00:18:59.483
They come. they make a lot of money.

263
00:18:59.517 --> 00:19:02.796
then they go back home a wealthy man.

264
00:19:02.831 --> 00:19:05.627
That didn't play out
for almost all of them.

265
00:19:09.493 --> 00:19:12.427
For several weeks.
Wong Chut King struggled with

266
00:19:12.461 --> 00:19:15.464
mounting fever. exhaustion.

267
00:19:15.499 --> 00:19:18.433
and painfully swollen
lymph nodes. or "buboes."

268
00:19:20.883 --> 00:19:23.714
Because city hospitals
were closed to the Chinese.

269
00:19:23.748 --> 00:19:27.304
he sought traditional Chinese remedies.

270
00:19:27.338 --> 00:19:30.134
but nothing seemed to help.

271
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:34.690
Eventually. he was too sick to move.

272
00:19:34.725 --> 00:19:35.967
His roommates.

273
00:19:36.002 --> 00:19:37.279
they see that he's dying.

274
00:19:37.314 --> 00:19:39.454
They take him to a local.
you know. what was called

275
00:19:39.488 --> 00:19:40.696
a Hall of Tranquility.

276
00:19:48.014 --> 00:19:52.052
The Chinese have a holistic view.

277
00:19:52.087 --> 00:19:56.540
They believe that when they die.

278
00:19:56.574 --> 00:20:01.614
their spirit needs to be tended to.

279
00:20:01.648 --> 00:20:04.651
And the remains

280
00:20:04.686 --> 00:20:07.758
had to be brought back
because of their view

281
00:20:07.792 --> 00:20:12.211
that the ancestors played
a great role in the afterlife.

282
00:20:15.904 --> 00:20:19.735
One of the sources of
mistrust between the community

283
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.187
and Western doctors was
a very different view of

284
00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:25.948
life and death.

285
00:20:25.983 --> 00:20:31.747
The body should not be cut.
autopsies were anathema.

286
00:20:31.782 --> 00:20:35.648
one's soul had to return
to one's home village.

287
00:20:35.682 --> 00:20:37.719
So the Chinese were very careful.

288
00:20:40.756 --> 00:20:43.069
So. it was a quiet affair.

289
00:20:43.103 --> 00:20:46.072
And Wong Chut King died alone.

290
00:20:46.106 --> 00:20:48.971
on March 6. 1900.

291
00:21:00.328 --> 00:21:04.297
State law required a
physician to issue a death certificate

292
00:21:04.332 --> 00:21:08.197
so a health inspector was
summoned to examine the body.

293
00:21:10.407 --> 00:21:13.927
He notices a bubo
in. in Wong Chut King's groin

294
00:21:13.962 --> 00:21:16.965
and he jumps back because
he does know what this is.

295
00:21:16.999 --> 00:21:20.486
He knows it's a sign of bubonic plague.

296
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.246
So. he figures that.

297
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:24.317
"I'm going to take a sample of this tissue

298
00:21:24.352 --> 00:21:26.250
"from Wong Chut King's body.

299
00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:29.529
"I'm going to run it over
to Kinyoun at Angel Island.

300
00:21:31.497 --> 00:21:33.430
"And I'm going to let him
make the decision

301
00:21:33.464 --> 00:21:35.328
of whether this is plague
or not."

302
00:21:37.986 --> 00:21:41.334
Kinyoun knew all about buboes.

303
00:21:41.369 --> 00:21:43.888
where the word "bubonic" comes from.

304
00:21:43.923 --> 00:21:48.652
The swollen lymph nodes were
an infamous sign of the plague.

305
00:21:48.686 --> 00:21:52.587
Yet he also knew that they
weren't enough for a diagnosis

306
00:21:52.621 --> 00:21:55.762
and he had to be 100% certain.

307
00:22:00.871 --> 00:22:04.530
To prove a plague death scientifically.

308
00:22:04.564 --> 00:22:07.533
you couldn't just do it by examining

309
00:22:07.567 --> 00:22:09.120
the live patient or the cadaver.

310
00:22:09.155 --> 00:22:11.847
You had to isolate the organism
from tissue.

311
00:22:14.022 --> 00:22:18.958
In 1900.
microbiology was still a fledgling field.

312
00:22:18.992 --> 00:22:21.029
And the idea that germs
could cause disease

313
00:22:21.063 --> 00:22:25.344
was not fully accepted.
even by many doctors.

314
00:22:25.378 --> 00:22:30.210
Kinyoun's superior.
Surgeon General Walter Wyman.

315
00:22:30.245 --> 00:22:32.903
had himself published a paper
on the plague that was full

316
00:22:32.937 --> 00:22:37.045
of speculations and misinformation:

317
00:22:37.079 --> 00:22:38.357
that the disease was spread

318
00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:42.740
by dust. tainted food.
and contaminated objects.

319
00:22:44.949 --> 00:22:47.642
Wyman also endorsed
racial theories of the time

320
00:22:47.676 --> 00:22:50.403
that the disease targeted Asians

321
00:22:50.438 --> 00:22:52.474
while sparing whites.

322
00:22:52.509 --> 00:22:54.683
Surgeon General Wyman. himself.

323
00:22:54.718 --> 00:22:56.858
said it was only a disease of rice eaters.

324
00:22:56.892 --> 00:22:59.723
If you ate a "muscular diet of meat."

325
00:22:59.757 --> 00:23:01.449
you were somehow immune to it.

326
00:23:01.483 --> 00:23:07.144
Such ignorance was
widespread due in part to the fact

327
00:23:07.178 --> 00:23:09.595
that scientific confirmation
could take years.

328
00:23:13.426 --> 00:23:16.429
Nevertheless.
European scientists had recently

329
00:23:16.464 --> 00:23:18.949
identified the bubonic plague bacteria

330
00:23:18.983 --> 00:23:22.228
using a test called Gram's stain.

331
00:23:25.127 --> 00:23:30.339
Bubonic plague is
transmitted by a bacteria called

332
00:23:30.374 --> 00:23:32.997
Yersinia pestis.

333
00:23:33.032 --> 00:23:38.520
And Gram stains are used
under the microscope to enhance

334
00:23:38.555 --> 00:23:40.591
the difference in colors.

335
00:23:40.626 --> 00:23:45.493
So. you can see the bacteria in
what we call a smear on a slide.

336
00:23:47.978 --> 00:23:50.877
And Yersinia pestis stains pink.

337
00:23:57.366 --> 00:24:00.749
As the first
American to have studied the bacilli.

338
00:24:00.784 --> 00:24:03.580
Kinyoun was unquestionably
the most qualified scientist

339
00:24:03.614 --> 00:24:05.789
in the country to test for plague.

340
00:24:08.377 --> 00:24:10.552
Hours after Wong's death.

341
00:24:10.587 --> 00:24:13.521
he undertook the exacting forensic work.

342
00:24:13.555 --> 00:24:16.213
using the sample taken from the body.

343
00:24:18.215 --> 00:24:21.287
Isolate the germ in biopsy.

344
00:24:21.321 --> 00:24:24.497
test it with the Gram stain.

345
00:24:27.638 --> 00:24:31.539
Put it under a microscope...

346
00:24:35.508 --> 00:24:40.099
And look for the distinctive
pink rod-shaped bacilli

347
00:24:40.133 --> 00:24:43.447
with rounded tips.

348
00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:45.622
And that was the classic
signature of plague.

349
00:24:50.696 --> 00:24:53.146
Yet the presence of
the telltale marker alone wasn't enough

350
00:24:53.181 --> 00:24:56.149
to confirm a diagnosis.

351
00:24:58.427 --> 00:25:01.016
Kinyoun would have to grow
the culture in his lab.

352
00:25:01.051 --> 00:25:03.398
which would take time.

353
00:25:03.432 --> 00:25:06.125
and there was none to spare.

354
00:25:08.679 --> 00:25:10.923
For he couldn't help but wonder:

355
00:25:10.957 --> 00:25:15.755
how many others might be infected?

356
00:25:23.142 --> 00:25:25.109
Across San Francisco Bay.

357
00:25:25.144 --> 00:25:28.803
the city board of health
was too spooked to wait.

358
00:25:28.837 --> 00:25:32.772
To them. it was clearly
a "Chinese problem."

359
00:25:32.807 --> 00:25:36.535
confined to Chinatown.

360
00:25:36.569 --> 00:25:39.261
So they decided to
control matters by quarantining

361
00:25:39.296 --> 00:25:42.748
the entire district.

362
00:25:42.782 --> 00:25:46.199
One day after Wong Chut King's death.

363
00:25:46.234 --> 00:25:49.064
the Chinese community awoke
to find ropes cordoning off

364
00:25:49.099 --> 00:25:50.825
their 12-block district.

365
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.657
Overnight. 20.000 people...

366
00:25:55.692 --> 00:25:58.453
nearly all of the city's Asians...

367
00:25:58.487 --> 00:26:03.113
found themselves virtual prisoners.

368
00:26:03.147 --> 00:26:05.115
What was unusual

369
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:07.427
was that it didn't apply
to this one particular house

370
00:26:07.462 --> 00:26:10.776
where the man was found. but applied to

371
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.571
the whole Chinese quarter.

372
00:26:12.605 --> 00:26:16.851
sealing off a whole area of a city.

373
00:26:19.888 --> 00:26:22.201
There was this kind of idea that

374
00:26:22.235 --> 00:26:24.893
the Chinese carry
a particular virulent form

375
00:26:24.928 --> 00:26:26.170
of some kind of disease.

376
00:26:26.205 --> 00:26:31.831
whether it was smallpox.
or syphilis. or bubonic plague.

377
00:26:31.866 --> 00:26:36.077
And that the disease is endemic
to their bodies.

378
00:26:36.111 --> 00:26:39.149
that it would be possible to infect

379
00:26:39.183 --> 00:26:41.323
innocent middle-class white people.

380
00:26:43.429 --> 00:26:46.052
There was definitely
this view that Asians were

381
00:26:46.087 --> 00:26:51.437
more susceptible to the disease
as opposed to whites.

382
00:26:51.471 --> 00:26:54.820
And this was a widely shared
view at the time.

383
00:26:57.926 --> 00:27:00.998
The residents of
Chinatown were really stuck.

384
00:27:01.033 --> 00:27:03.000
They weren't allowed to be citizens.

385
00:27:03.035 --> 00:27:04.243
They weren't allowed to own property.

386
00:27:04.277 --> 00:27:06.763
They weren't allowed
many fundamental rights.

387
00:27:09.317 --> 00:27:13.908
In 1900. anti-Chinese
sentiment wasn't isolated...

388
00:27:13.942 --> 00:27:17.325
it was codified by federal law.

389
00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:22.123
The Chinese Exclusion Act
of 1882 prohibited all Chinese

390
00:27:22.157 --> 00:27:23.987
from citizenship.

391
00:27:24.021 --> 00:27:28.957
essentially relegating them
to the margins of society.

392
00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:34.273
The Chinese were already not seen as human

393
00:27:34.307 --> 00:27:37.448
before the Chinese Exclusion Act.

394
00:27:37.483 --> 00:27:39.692
which is why the act passed.

395
00:27:41.452 --> 00:27:43.592
The only time in our history
that we specifically named

396
00:27:43.627 --> 00:27:46.941
an ethnicity to say they can't
come to the United States;

397
00:27:46.975 --> 00:27:49.978
they don't belong.
they're too different than us.

398
00:27:54.293 --> 00:27:58.918
The building of
the transcontinental railroad

399
00:27:58.953 --> 00:28:00.920
required tons of hard labor.

400
00:28:00.955 --> 00:28:04.372
which Chinese workers had taken on.

401
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.342
Once that final golden spike was driven.

402
00:28:09.377 --> 00:28:11.103
the welcome mat was withdrawn.

403
00:28:11.137 --> 00:28:18.973
And the once-essential
Chinese workers were regarded as

404
00:28:19.007 --> 00:28:21.423
a surplus that would cut into
demand for white labor.

405
00:28:21.458 --> 00:28:24.392
So. the white labor movement
was very hostile.

406
00:28:29.362 --> 00:28:31.848
Almost 20 years have
gone by since the Exclusion Act.

407
00:28:31.882 --> 00:28:36.300
And this has been a very
tumultuous number of decades

408
00:28:36.335 --> 00:28:39.545
where the government tries
to take this right away.

409
00:28:39.579 --> 00:28:41.961
impose that discriminatory law.

410
00:28:41.996 --> 00:28:44.688
to try to drive people away.

411
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.176
The Chinese community
saw the cordon for what it was:

412
00:28:50.211 --> 00:28:54.042
the latest unjust action
taken against them

413
00:28:54.077 --> 00:28:58.081
based on flimsy evidence
and a convenient excuse.

414
00:29:00.428 --> 00:29:03.293
The populace was
violently opposed to being sealed

415
00:29:03.327 --> 00:29:05.019
inside Chinatown.

416
00:29:05.053 --> 00:29:08.332
Many people worked outside the district.

417
00:29:08.367 --> 00:29:10.783
They had jobs to get to.

418
00:29:10.818 --> 00:29:12.785
And interestingly.

419
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.581
the white community.

420
00:29:15.615 --> 00:29:17.928
while not so sympathetic

421
00:29:17.963 --> 00:29:21.035
to the viewpoint of the people
in Chinatown.

422
00:29:21.069 --> 00:29:25.349
wanted their cooks and gardeners
and domestic back on the job.

423
00:29:25.384 --> 00:29:29.906
And so all sides were at war.

424
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.806
And by March 10. the ropes came down.

425
00:29:33.841 --> 00:29:38.086
So. the first quarantine of Chinatown.

426
00:29:38.121 --> 00:29:39.778
it didn't last very long...

427
00:29:39.812 --> 00:29:43.264
only three days.

428
00:29:43.298 --> 00:29:46.198
Because the
quarantine came down so quickly.

429
00:29:46.232 --> 00:29:50.409
many people in San Francisco
thought it was just all a sham.

430
00:29:50.443 --> 00:29:52.376
It almost eroded public trust immediately.

431
00:29:52.411 --> 00:29:57.036
In the face of such apparent incompetence.

432
00:29:57.071 --> 00:30:00.177
the city's response was one of relief...

433
00:30:00.212 --> 00:30:04.492
and amused contempt.

434
00:30:04.526 --> 00:30:07.495
One of the papers
celebrated the end of the first quarantine

435
00:30:07.529 --> 00:30:10.739
by writing a silly poem.

436
00:30:10.774 --> 00:30:14.398
"Sweet Fong is at his post once more

437
00:30:14.433 --> 00:30:17.850
and cooking reigns supreme."

438
00:30:17.885 --> 00:30:21.647
Because the people had gotten
their domestic servants back.

439
00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.583
It was that kind of racial supremacy

440
00:30:26.617 --> 00:30:29.828
emanating from every corner of the city.

441
00:30:33.901 --> 00:30:36.351
Alone in his lab on Angel Island.

442
00:30:36.386 --> 00:30:39.354
Kinyoun had managed to successfully grow

443
00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:42.599
the microorganism within 48 hours.

444
00:30:42.633 --> 00:30:47.466
But the next step... injecting it
into a healthy animal

445
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.609
to see what would happen...
would take days.

446
00:30:52.643 --> 00:30:56.509
Once again.
Kinyoun took extra precautions.

447
00:30:56.544 --> 00:31:02.067
choosing to inoculate not one
but four lab animals:

448
00:31:02.101 --> 00:31:06.209
two guinea pigs. a rat. and a monkey.

449
00:31:09.212 --> 00:31:11.800
Three of the animals died pretty quickly.

450
00:31:13.561 --> 00:31:18.600
The last one. the monkey.
was the one he was hoping on.

451
00:31:18.635 --> 00:31:24.813
If it didn't die. then maybe
it's not the plague.

452
00:31:24.848 --> 00:31:26.194
Well. it died.

453
00:31:28.645 --> 00:31:34.582
On March 13. seven
days after Wong Chut King passed away.

454
00:31:34.616 --> 00:31:38.172
Kinyoun was finally able
to confirm the cause of death.

455
00:31:41.244 --> 00:31:44.488
Wong became the first
diagnosed case of bubonic plague

456
00:31:44.523 --> 00:31:46.318
in the United States.

457
00:31:48.837 --> 00:31:52.358
But Kinyoun feared
he would not be the last.

458
00:32:02.265 --> 00:32:03.956
Kinyoun immediately sends

459
00:32:03.991 --> 00:32:05.026
a coded telegram to D.C.

460
00:32:05.061 --> 00:32:07.442
"Bumpkin confirmed."

461
00:32:07.477 --> 00:32:10.100
And that was the code word
that plague is here.

462
00:32:13.448 --> 00:32:17.245
Kinyoun's boss Walter
Wyman had every reason to believe

463
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.799
that if it got out of
San Francisco. it would

464
00:32:19.834 --> 00:32:23.700
go over the whole country and
countless deaths would occur.

465
00:32:25.736 --> 00:32:27.946
So. the people in Washington
were just alarmed.

466
00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.776
and their point of view is.
"We don't care what you do.

467
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.122
"If you have to burn the place down.

468
00:32:32.157 --> 00:32:34.780
"just make sure that you contain
this epidemic.

469
00:32:34.814 --> 00:32:35.815
It's a national emergency."

470
00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:46.205
As federal officials frantically
tried to coordinate a response.

471
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.483
word of Kinyoun's diagnosis spread quickly

472
00:32:48.518 --> 00:32:52.004
among San Francisco's leaders.

473
00:32:52.039 --> 00:32:54.489
Yet powerful merchants and politicians

474
00:32:54.524 --> 00:33:00.185
like Mayor James Phelan
refused to accept his findings.

475
00:33:03.498 --> 00:33:05.984
Shipping exchanges around the world

476
00:33:06.018 --> 00:33:08.158
was very. very important

477
00:33:08.193 --> 00:33:10.540
source of income.

478
00:33:10.574 --> 00:33:13.370
So. if there was plague in San Francisco.

479
00:33:13.405 --> 00:33:15.924
it would be blocked.

480
00:33:15.959 --> 00:33:19.031
it would no longer be open.

481
00:33:19.066 --> 00:33:23.311
So industries were at stake.

482
00:33:24.864 --> 00:33:27.557
Mayor Phelan was very
concerned that if word got around

483
00:33:27.591 --> 00:33:29.524
that San Francisco

484
00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:32.907
had cases of plague that the
city's commerce would be dealt

485
00:33:32.941 --> 00:33:36.635
a really serious blow.

486
00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:39.672
City leaders were used to autonomy.

487
00:33:39.707 --> 00:33:42.848
and didn't like being told what to do.

488
00:33:42.882 --> 00:33:47.232
especially by authorities
at the federal level.

489
00:33:48.785 --> 00:33:54.101
With the Marine Hospital
Service. the federal government.

490
00:33:54.135 --> 00:33:57.414
they were now centrally becoming
involved in public health

491
00:33:57.449 --> 00:33:59.347
across the United States.

492
00:33:59.382 --> 00:34:05.664
And they felt they had supreme authority.

493
00:34:05.698 --> 00:34:10.565
But the city government.
the merchant elite

494
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:15.674
was saying to them. "We have
jurisdiction in San Francisco."

495
00:34:15.708 --> 00:34:17.883
And then there were state officials

496
00:34:17.917 --> 00:34:21.162
and the governor who thought.

497
00:34:21.197 --> 00:34:23.578
"Well. we have authority over
all of California."

498
00:34:23.613 --> 00:34:26.478
And it becomes a question immediately

499
00:34:26.512 --> 00:34:27.927
of who has authority.

500
00:34:27.962 --> 00:34:30.137
If there is an outbreak. is this
a federal responsibility?

501
00:34:30.171 --> 00:34:32.553
Or is this the city. or is it the state?

502
00:34:35.314 --> 00:34:38.317
Most San Franciscans didn't care.

503
00:34:38.352 --> 00:34:40.112
They couldn't be bothered with the death

504
00:34:40.147 --> 00:34:43.219
of a faceless stranger in Chinatown.

505
00:34:43.253 --> 00:34:48.741
especially given widespread
beliefs that whites were immune.

506
00:34:48.776 --> 00:34:50.260
As for city leaders.

507
00:34:50.295 --> 00:34:53.574
while they refused to accept
Kinyoun's diagnosis.

508
00:34:53.608 --> 00:34:57.474
they did agree that what they
called the "Chinese problem"

509
00:34:57.509 --> 00:35:01.720
needed to be contained.

510
00:35:01.754 --> 00:35:05.137
They didn't really
understand how the bubonic plague

511
00:35:05.172 --> 00:35:06.932
was transmitted to people.

512
00:35:06.966 --> 00:35:08.899
But they knew if it occurred in

513
00:35:08.934 --> 00:35:12.179
a city it would be in one area.

514
00:35:12.213 --> 00:35:14.457
And so. the public health
approach was to find the focus

515
00:35:14.491 --> 00:35:17.356
and go in there and do whatever you could

516
00:35:17.391 --> 00:35:20.118
to get rid of the disease.

517
00:35:20.152 --> 00:35:22.637
The moment Mayor Phelan declared

518
00:35:22.672 --> 00:35:25.295
"Asiatic infections are a constant menace

519
00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:28.643
to San Francisco's public health."

520
00:35:28.678 --> 00:35:33.476
75 health inspectors
and dozens of policemen.

521
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:37.100
armed with sledgehammers and axes.

522
00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:41.691
descended on an unsuspecting Chinatown.

523
00:35:41.725 --> 00:35:47.766
They smashed down doors.
ransacked homes. stole brazenly.

524
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.563
and beat anyone who stood up to them.

525
00:35:53.323 --> 00:35:57.396
They were subjected
to plague measures. which included

526
00:35:57.431 --> 00:36:00.261
torching of belongings.
they would bring in

527
00:36:00.296 --> 00:36:03.851
smudge pots of sulfur.
and fumigate a building.

528
00:36:03.885 --> 00:36:07.648
If you were a merchant selling
fine silks or ceramics.

529
00:36:07.682 --> 00:36:10.375
it would spoil your goods.

530
00:36:10.409 --> 00:36:13.585
So. these measures. which were
crude and discriminatory

531
00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:15.449
and not very effective.

532
00:36:15.483 --> 00:36:16.829
frightened the populace.

533
00:36:16.864 --> 00:36:18.245
People were not eager to report

534
00:36:18.279 --> 00:36:20.074
a case of sickness in their home.

535
00:36:23.871 --> 00:36:28.151
In 1900.
at the time of the bubonic plague.

536
00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:31.189
my great-grandfather had a business called

537
00:36:31.223 --> 00:36:33.881
the Pacific Fruit Packing Company.

538
00:36:33.915 --> 00:36:37.471
And my family lived above the cannery

539
00:36:37.505 --> 00:36:40.888
on Stockton Street in Chinatown.

540
00:36:40.922 --> 00:36:42.303
They went to church

541
00:36:42.338 --> 00:36:45.582
where Ng Poon Chew
was the assistant pastor.

542
00:36:45.617 --> 00:36:47.550
And that's how when he started
a newspaper.

543
00:36:47.584 --> 00:36:50.035
my great-grandfather helped him fund

544
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:51.485
the "Chung Sai Yat Po."

545
00:36:53.487 --> 00:36:57.249
And in Chinatown. they would
post some of the newspapers

546
00:36:57.284 --> 00:36:59.251
on the walls.

547
00:36:59.286 --> 00:37:03.359
So the Chinese knew exactly
what was going on.

548
00:37:06.465 --> 00:37:13.231
Ng Poon Chew and his
newspaper documented what the deeply felt

549
00:37:13.265 --> 00:37:16.268
fears and concerns were
of Chinese laborers.

550
00:37:16.303 --> 00:37:19.651
how they distrusted
Western medical authority.

551
00:37:19.685 --> 00:37:22.136
how they feared
what was going to happen to them

552
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:26.347
from a Chinese perspective.

553
00:37:26.382 --> 00:37:30.731
"Alas. why should
Chinatown's good name depend on

554
00:37:30.765 --> 00:37:34.838
"the life and death of a monkey?

555
00:37:34.873 --> 00:37:36.909
"We don't know whether they are
rooting for Chinatown

556
00:37:36.944 --> 00:37:39.878
or the monkey."

557
00:37:39.912 --> 00:37:41.845
"Chung Sai Yat Po Daily."

558
00:37:48.921 --> 00:37:52.718
Nine days after Wong Chut King's death.

559
00:37:52.753 --> 00:37:56.170
Kinyoun confirmed three more cases...

560
00:37:56.204 --> 00:37:58.103
all within Chinatown.

561
00:38:01.348 --> 00:38:04.420
Kinyoun had feared
such an outbreak all along.

562
00:38:04.454 --> 00:38:07.526
knowing that even a handful of cases

563
00:38:07.561 --> 00:38:09.010
could explode exponentially

564
00:38:09.045 --> 00:38:12.669
into a national epidemic within weeks.

565
00:38:13.981 --> 00:38:16.328
The urgency of the situation
caught the eye

566
00:38:16.363 --> 00:38:19.918
of newspaper magnate
William Randolph Hearst.

567
00:38:19.952 --> 00:38:24.371
On March 18. his paper.
"The New York Journal."

568
00:38:24.405 --> 00:38:26.925
published a special national edition

569
00:38:26.959 --> 00:38:31.309
trumpeting the sensational story
from California.

570
00:38:32.689 --> 00:38:35.589
Pressured by commercial stakeholders.

571
00:38:35.623 --> 00:38:38.868
San Francisco's leaders quickly responded.

572
00:38:38.902 --> 00:38:41.871
enlisting the editors
of leading newspapers to dismiss

573
00:38:41.905 --> 00:38:47.014
what they now called "rumors."

574
00:38:47.048 --> 00:38:48.912
City Hall and all
of San Francisco's elite.

575
00:38:48.947 --> 00:38:50.983
they had the same idea in mind.

576
00:38:51.018 --> 00:38:55.436
"We're not going to report
any news of the plague."

577
00:38:57.611 --> 00:38:59.785
You have the "Chronicle" saying.

578
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.373
"We're gonna write an editorial

579
00:39:01.408 --> 00:39:03.237
"saying that Kinyoun or anybody else from

580
00:39:03.271 --> 00:39:04.894
"Marine Hospital Service
is just trying to pick

581
00:39:04.928 --> 00:39:08.104
San Francisco's pocket."

582
00:39:08.138 --> 00:39:12.108
Dr. Joseph Kinyoun was a proud man.

583
00:39:12.142 --> 00:39:14.731
He regarded the tools of science.

584
00:39:14.766 --> 00:39:19.011
the enlightenment
of his technology. as a gift.

585
00:39:19.046 --> 00:39:21.807
And he expected. quite rightly.

586
00:39:21.842 --> 00:39:24.741
some deference and respect for
what he brought to the city.

587
00:39:24.776 --> 00:39:26.778
And he got none of it.

588
00:39:26.812 --> 00:39:33.060
Because from the moment that
Joseph Kinyoun diagnosed plague

589
00:39:33.094 --> 00:39:36.339
in the glands of Wong Chut King.
science was on trial.

590
00:39:40.447 --> 00:39:43.346
And Bubonic plague was called
"Kinyoun's fake."

591
00:39:58.706 --> 00:40:01.744
As the media storm swirled around him.

592
00:40:01.778 --> 00:40:03.124
a frantic Kinyoun

593
00:40:03.159 --> 00:40:07.232
tried to retrace the last days
of each victim's life

594
00:40:07.266 --> 00:40:10.062
in a desperate attempt
to determine who or where

595
00:40:10.097 --> 00:40:11.892
the next might be.

596
00:40:15.378 --> 00:40:17.863
What made Kinyoun
so terrified when he started

597
00:40:17.898 --> 00:40:19.486
identifying the disease.

598
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.454
was he found one victim and he
could not find any connections

599
00:40:22.489 --> 00:40:23.800
to the next victim.

600
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:28.874
It's almost like
you're looking at the ocean.

601
00:40:28.909 --> 00:40:33.154
and you can't see it. but you
know something is down there.

602
00:40:33.189 --> 00:40:36.986
And he had no idea what it was.

603
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.712
It was a mystery.

604
00:40:38.746 --> 00:40:41.231
There was a kind of creeping pace.

605
00:40:41.266 --> 00:40:44.890
There would be a case or two.
and then it would pause.

606
00:40:44.925 --> 00:40:49.757
Kinyoun tried to puzzle it out.

607
00:40:49.792 --> 00:40:53.796
He was looking for other cases of plague.

608
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:58.559
He also knew that because of the
way Chinatown was being treated

609
00:40:58.594 --> 00:41:01.631
by local officials. they might hide cases.

610
00:41:04.462 --> 00:41:10.916
"Suspicions everywhere
and every shadow becomes an enemy."

611
00:41:10.951 --> 00:41:12.953
"Chung Sai Yat Po Daily."

612
00:41:15.334 --> 00:41:20.547
A plague death would
require autopsy to confirm the case.

613
00:41:20.581 --> 00:41:23.584
It was an offense in the culture.

614
00:41:23.619 --> 00:41:27.519
So no one was eager to call in
the scientists.

615
00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:31.385
And it becomes a cat and mouse game.

616
00:41:31.419 --> 00:41:34.526
And people keep on questioning him.

617
00:41:34.561 --> 00:41:36.770
If the plague is as scary
as you're saying it is.

618
00:41:36.804 --> 00:41:38.944
there should be bodies everywhere.

619
00:41:38.979 --> 00:41:40.981
We should also see living victims

620
00:41:41.015 --> 00:41:42.292
who are struggling with this.

621
00:41:46.262 --> 00:41:47.539
People thought.

622
00:41:47.574 --> 00:41:48.609
"Well. if the plague existed.

623
00:41:48.644 --> 00:41:50.887
"it should be spreading like wildfire.

624
00:41:50.922 --> 00:41:56.548
Why aren't hundreds of people
infected with it?"

625
00:41:56.583 --> 00:42:01.622
And it obviously made things
difficult for Kinyoun.

626
00:42:01.657 --> 00:42:03.210
because in the face of
pretty clear evidence.

627
00:42:03.244 --> 00:42:05.799
people denied that the plague
existed at all.

628
00:42:10.424 --> 00:42:12.564
When three more people died in mid-May.

629
00:42:12.599 --> 00:42:17.327
Kinyoun telegrammed Wyman urging
a bold and unprecedented plan.

630
00:42:21.124 --> 00:42:23.782
He proposed vaccinating
every Chinatown resident

631
00:42:23.817 --> 00:42:29.132
with the recently developed
Haffkine vaccine.

632
00:42:29.167 --> 00:42:34.517
In 1900. vaccination was still
a frightening concept to most.

633
00:42:34.552 --> 00:42:38.176
But in Chinatown. the proposal
was further complicated

634
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:41.766
by the dark racial dynamics of the time.

635
00:42:44.354 --> 00:42:46.978
There'd been a
long history of white people.

636
00:42:47.012 --> 00:42:48.186
European-descended people.

637
00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.120
treating the Chinese
in San Francisco badly.

638
00:42:51.154 --> 00:42:54.054
So. the rational expectation
was. you know.

639
00:42:54.088 --> 00:42:55.814
if the white power structure
wants this done.

640
00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:57.195
there's gotta be something wrong with it.

641
00:42:59.438 --> 00:43:02.027
The Chinese relationship
with city health authorities.

642
00:43:02.062 --> 00:43:04.996
there was nothing positive about it.

643
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:08.171
There was a history of malignant neglect.

644
00:43:08.206 --> 00:43:12.486
Chinese were routinely refused
treatment at city hospitals.

645
00:43:14.143 --> 00:43:18.630
It was only that year that
a Chinese clinic was allowed

646
00:43:18.665 --> 00:43:23.255
to open in Chinatown
called the Tung Wah Dispensary.

647
00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.257
So Chinese had absolutely no trust

648
00:43:25.292 --> 00:43:28.606
in city health authorities.

649
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.642
Also. they weren't vaccinating
white people.

650
00:43:30.677 --> 00:43:34.853
So it seemed to be targeted at them.

651
00:43:34.888 --> 00:43:39.893
The Haffkine was largely untested.

652
00:43:39.927 --> 00:43:43.172
Existing data showed only
a 50% protection rate.

653
00:43:45.899 --> 00:43:48.660
Furthermore. the drug's
purported side effects

654
00:43:48.695 --> 00:43:51.870
were so notorious that a
headline-hungry reporter

655
00:43:51.905 --> 00:43:53.320
from a Hearst newspaper

656
00:43:53.354 --> 00:43:56.564
volunteered to be injected himself.

657
00:44:02.778 --> 00:44:05.919
"Within two hours. the serum had spread

658
00:44:05.953 --> 00:44:10.337
"through my system and
its effects began to be felt.

659
00:44:10.371 --> 00:44:15.273
"Shooting pains extended
through the chest. down the arm.

660
00:44:15.307 --> 00:44:18.863
"and even into my neck and head.

661
00:44:18.897 --> 00:44:21.003
"My left arm felt numb.

662
00:44:21.037 --> 00:44:27.250
The pain in my shoulder. chest.
neck. and arm was quite severe."

663
00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:34.499
Out of thousands
of Chinese living in San Francisco.

664
00:44:34.533 --> 00:44:39.366
only 53 were willing to be vaccinated.

665
00:44:41.713 --> 00:44:45.234
Growing desperate.
Kinyoun telegrammed Wyman.

666
00:44:47.443 --> 00:44:50.929
Regard situation very serious.

667
00:44:50.964 --> 00:44:56.314
Will require almost superhuman
efforts to control now.

668
00:44:56.348 --> 00:44:59.317
So much time has been lost.

669
00:45:01.975 --> 00:45:04.909
And that's when Marine Hospital Service

670
00:45:04.943 --> 00:45:07.497
had to make its first authoritative

671
00:45:07.532 --> 00:45:09.707
stand against plague.

672
00:45:12.537 --> 00:45:17.059
Surgeon General Wyman
telegraphs Kinyoun immediately. saying.

673
00:45:17.093 --> 00:45:20.200
"You are our man in San Francisco.

674
00:45:20.234 --> 00:45:21.442
"It all depends on you.

675
00:45:21.477 --> 00:45:24.480
You know.
you have to protect us all."

676
00:45:24.514 --> 00:45:28.070
Now charged with
overseeing the entire West Coast.

677
00:45:28.104 --> 00:45:31.452
Kinyoun quickly hired additional officers.

678
00:45:31.487 --> 00:45:34.628
whom he dispatched across
California and Oregon

679
00:45:34.662 --> 00:45:37.320
to beef up inspection and patrols.

680
00:45:40.047 --> 00:45:43.361
He also made vaccination mandatory.

681
00:45:43.395 --> 00:45:46.778
and took exclusive aim
at not just the Chinese.

682
00:45:46.813 --> 00:45:50.092
but Japanese with
an unheard-of travel ban.

683
00:45:54.613 --> 00:45:58.272
On May the 18th. the
Board of Health of San Francisco

684
00:45:58.307 --> 00:46:01.551
passes a resolution to order
the transport companies

685
00:46:01.586 --> 00:46:04.658
to refuse transportation
to Chinese and Japanese

686
00:46:04.692 --> 00:46:07.005
without the certificate
that said that the person

687
00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.079
had been inoculated
with this Haffkine's vaccine.

688
00:46:12.114 --> 00:46:14.219
And it's quite clear
that they have endorsed

689
00:46:14.254 --> 00:46:17.291
the recommendations
that have been passed onto them

690
00:46:17.326 --> 00:46:19.777
by Kinyoun.

691
00:46:19.811 --> 00:46:23.194
So now the Chinese and Japanese
are being told.

692
00:46:23.228 --> 00:46:25.092
"Do it. or you're confined
to San Francisco.

693
00:46:25.127 --> 00:46:28.199
You won't be able to leave."

694
00:46:28.233 --> 00:46:30.477
It was being pushed on them coercively.

695
00:46:34.377 --> 00:46:36.897
"The doctors are
about to compel our Chinese people

696
00:46:36.932 --> 00:46:39.382
"to be inoculated.

697
00:46:39.417 --> 00:46:45.941
"Tomorrow. all business houses
large or small must be closed

698
00:46:45.975 --> 00:46:50.946
and wait until this unjust
action is settled."

699
00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:54.294
"Chung Sai Yat Po Daily."

700
00:46:54.328 --> 00:46:57.780
Its back to the wall. a defiant Chinatown

701
00:46:57.815 --> 00:46:59.575
turned to its own leaders:

702
00:46:59.609 --> 00:47:03.027
a consortium of
district associations called

703
00:47:03.061 --> 00:47:07.272
the Chinese Six Companies.

704
00:47:07.307 --> 00:47:10.344
The leaders of the Six
Companies were the biggest merchants

705
00:47:10.379 --> 00:47:12.622
in Chinatown.

706
00:47:12.657 --> 00:47:15.004
the most influential members

707
00:47:15.039 --> 00:47:16.868
of their associations.

708
00:47:16.903 --> 00:47:18.387
Any dispute with the city government

709
00:47:18.421 --> 00:47:21.839
or the state government. Chinese
would send their representatives

710
00:47:21.873 --> 00:47:26.188
to negotiate or to protest.

711
00:47:26.222 --> 00:47:29.674
The Chinese leaders
met with Kinyoun at the consulate

712
00:47:29.708 --> 00:47:33.298
and implored him to call off his plans.

713
00:47:33.333 --> 00:47:37.337
When he refused. the Chinese
felt they had no option left

714
00:47:37.371 --> 00:47:39.580
but to take to the streets.

715
00:47:39.615 --> 00:47:43.584
From the most powerful merchant
to the lowliest worker.

716
00:47:43.619 --> 00:47:46.070
all of Chinatown took immediate action

717
00:47:46.104 --> 00:47:49.901
to protest Kinyoun's orders.

718
00:47:53.111 --> 00:47:55.182
There were riots.

719
00:47:55.217 --> 00:47:58.945
A thousand Chinese protesters
descended on Portsmouth Square

720
00:47:58.979 --> 00:48:02.224
in Chinatown where federal
doctors had set up tents

721
00:48:02.258 --> 00:48:03.604
to vaccinate people.

722
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.714
And they pulled cobblestones
out of the streets

723
00:48:09.748 --> 00:48:11.647
and threw them in shop windows.

724
00:48:11.681 --> 00:48:13.925
pitching furniture into the street.

725
00:48:17.964 --> 00:48:19.344
They stood up to him. and they said.

726
00:48:19.379 --> 00:48:21.691
"We are not standing for
these measures."

727
00:48:24.246 --> 00:48:26.593
It was so terrible that

728
00:48:26.627 --> 00:48:28.353
a hundred police had to protect Kinyoun

729
00:48:28.388 --> 00:48:32.323
because the San Francisco mobs
would have killed him.

730
00:48:38.674 --> 00:48:43.127
The Chinese in San
Francisco are beleaguered.

731
00:48:43.161 --> 00:48:46.613
but they also have fought every
inch of the way

732
00:48:46.647 --> 00:48:50.928
with legal cases that are brought by

733
00:48:50.962 --> 00:48:52.101
the leadership of the community.

734
00:48:52.136 --> 00:48:53.413
the merchant leaders.

735
00:48:53.447 --> 00:48:58.073
sometimes together
with the Chinese Consul.

736
00:48:58.107 --> 00:49:00.972
They sued the government over everything.

737
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:08.221
Chinatown rose
up as one to fight the travel ban.

738
00:49:08.255 --> 00:49:12.225
Within days of the mandate.
a class action suit was filed.

739
00:49:12.259 --> 00:49:17.575
naming Kinyoun and the
San Francisco Board of Health.

740
00:49:17.609 --> 00:49:21.475
A businessman named Wong Wai sued.

741
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.719
he went to court.

742
00:49:23.753 --> 00:49:26.515
and he charged that Dr. Kinyoun

743
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:28.724
and everyone involved

744
00:49:28.758 --> 00:49:31.071
had violated the rights of the Chinese.

745
00:49:32.555 --> 00:49:34.626
There was a
petition for an injunction to stop

746
00:49:34.661 --> 00:49:36.180
the health authorities
from preventing people

747
00:49:36.214 --> 00:49:37.940
from leaving the city.

748
00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:40.287
It was racially discriminatory
and that was forbidden

749
00:49:40.322 --> 00:49:42.427
by the 14th amendment.

750
00:49:42.462 --> 00:49:44.602
which says. "No state shall
deprive any person of life.

751
00:49:44.636 --> 00:49:47.260
"liberty. or property without
due process of law.

752
00:49:47.294 --> 00:49:50.642
"nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction

753
00:49:50.677 --> 00:49:52.990
the equal protection
of the law."

754
00:49:53.024 --> 00:49:56.855
The Chinese were not eligible
to become citizens.

755
00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:59.272
but they had secured for themselves

756
00:49:59.306 --> 00:50:02.240
recognition as constitutional persons.

757
00:50:02.275 --> 00:50:05.036
And as such.
they came under the protection

758
00:50:05.071 --> 00:50:08.626
of the 14th amendment.

759
00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:13.734
What you end up having
for the court case is a question.

760
00:50:13.769 --> 00:50:20.327
Is this a kind of unfair use
of the law that targets

761
00:50:20.362 --> 00:50:25.022
one group racially unfairly?

762
00:50:25.056 --> 00:50:27.300
The judge agreed with the Chinese.

763
00:50:27.334 --> 00:50:31.028
And he said. "I see no proof
that you've offered

764
00:50:31.062 --> 00:50:35.032
"that this is a disease
more likely to be contracted by

765
00:50:35.066 --> 00:50:38.449
or transmitted by
Chinese people."

766
00:50:38.483 --> 00:50:42.004
He said. "This travel ban
had been illegally applied

767
00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:45.214
"with an evil eye and an uneven hand.

768
00:50:45.249 --> 00:50:49.632
"focused on racial theories
of disease transmission...

769
00:50:49.667 --> 00:50:51.979
completely unscientific."

770
00:50:55.569 --> 00:50:58.503
In addition. the judge
issued a restraining order against

771
00:50:58.538 --> 00:51:01.955
Kinyoun and advised him and the MHS

772
00:51:01.989 --> 00:51:06.822
in no uncertain terms to back off.

773
00:51:06.856 --> 00:51:08.134
Stung by the emphatic ruling.

774
00:51:08.168 --> 00:51:13.035
Kinyoun wired his fears to Wyman.

775
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:18.385
Believe
situation to United States very grave.

776
00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:21.112
The decision practically
nullifies all acts

777
00:51:21.147 --> 00:51:24.288
of federal government.

778
00:51:24.322 --> 00:51:29.258
Most serious blow Service has received.

779
00:51:32.158 --> 00:51:34.677
Unwavering in his convictions.

780
00:51:34.712 --> 00:51:37.404
Kinyoun ignored the judge
and continued to enforce

781
00:51:37.439 --> 00:51:42.651
the known scientific measures
of isolation and sanitation.

782
00:51:42.685 --> 00:51:45.309
He pushed for camps on Angel Island.

783
00:51:45.343 --> 00:51:47.932
as well as remote Mission Rock.

784
00:51:47.966 --> 00:51:53.386
to detain people even suspected
of having the plague.

785
00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:57.355
There were now threats
to remove people forcibly from Chinatown.

786
00:52:01.014 --> 00:52:03.568
And at the head of it all
was Dr. Kinyoun.

787
00:52:03.603 --> 00:52:05.432
so he was called the Wolf Doctor.

788
00:52:09.022 --> 00:52:13.578
He acquired this nickname
for what was perceived as

789
00:52:13.613 --> 00:52:16.685
this snappy and officious manner...

790
00:52:16.719 --> 00:52:20.240
aggressive. an assault on people.

791
00:52:20.275 --> 00:52:22.173
kind of adding insult to injury.

792
00:52:29.491 --> 00:52:33.564
"The wolf doctor
is baring his claws and teeth."

793
00:52:33.598 --> 00:52:37.602
"Enforced relocation
to an icy remote island"

794
00:52:37.637 --> 00:52:43.401
"renders us without wings to fly."

795
00:52:43.436 --> 00:52:48.441
"Chung Sai Yat Po Daily."

796
00:52:48.475 --> 00:52:50.822
The city and the health
authorities were never really

797
00:52:50.857 --> 00:52:56.759
interested in ameliorating
the conditions in Chinatown.

798
00:52:56.794 --> 00:53:00.625
What they wanted to do was
isolate the Chinese community.

799
00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:04.284
protect white people.
and that was their goal.

800
00:53:04.319 --> 00:53:07.770
So there's very little space
to gain people's trust

801
00:53:07.805 --> 00:53:09.634
because the whole thing is rotten.

802
00:53:13.776 --> 00:53:16.572
And now. other states were starting to put

803
00:53:16.607 --> 00:53:19.782
commercial pressure on California as well.

804
00:53:19.817 --> 00:53:20.887
Everything erupted

805
00:53:20.921 --> 00:53:23.648
in an acrimonious three-day meeting...

806
00:53:23.683 --> 00:53:27.065
with Kinyoun weighing in forcefully.

807
00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.208
The state of Texas

808
00:53:31.242 --> 00:53:32.968
was preventing people and products

809
00:53:33.002 --> 00:53:34.590
from San Francisco.

810
00:53:34.625 --> 00:53:36.834
from entering Texas.

811
00:53:36.868 --> 00:53:40.182
So. the state board of health
was putting tremendous pressure

812
00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:43.358
on the local board of health
and says. "What you need to do

813
00:53:43.392 --> 00:53:45.256
is quarantine Chinatown."

814
00:53:49.398 --> 00:53:53.091
On May 28. Kinyoun privately exulted

815
00:53:53.126 --> 00:53:55.784
when the state health board
secured what he had long thought

816
00:53:55.818 --> 00:53:57.786
was the best option...

817
00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:04.275
a full lockdown of all
of Chinatown. indefinitely.

818
00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:09.384
Within hours. 159 policemen
descended on the district.

819
00:54:09.418 --> 00:54:12.249
working in three around-the-clock shifts.

820
00:54:14.147 --> 00:54:16.598
They start putting
barbed wire around the quarter.

821
00:54:16.632 --> 00:54:20.498
they start putting
a wall up around Chinatown.

822
00:54:23.018 --> 00:54:25.917
It becomes very clear
to the Chinese that this is

823
00:54:25.952 --> 00:54:28.506
not like the first quarantine.

824
00:54:31.337 --> 00:54:33.200
The Chinese were very. very
upset immediately.

825
00:54:33.235 --> 00:54:35.548
as soon as the quarantine was declared.

826
00:54:37.584 --> 00:54:43.210
Once again. nearly
20.000 people were locked down.

827
00:54:43.245 --> 00:54:46.075
They had no idea when
they would be allowed out

828
00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:48.906
or whether the authorities
might even attempt to burn down

829
00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:52.150
the district like Honolulu
only months before.

830
00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.121
With no streetcar service.

831
00:54:57.155 --> 00:55:00.745
or incoming shipments of food
and other vital supplies.

832
00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.230
panic quickly spread.

833
00:55:05.888 --> 00:55:09.961
It was very draconian for the Chinese.

834
00:55:09.996 --> 00:55:11.825
You had this complicated
interaction between

835
00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:16.036
the city. state.
and the federal government.

836
00:55:16.071 --> 00:55:19.108
But there was almost a consensus
that. among all of them.

837
00:55:19.143 --> 00:55:21.697
that somehow the heart of
the problem were the Chinese.

838
00:55:21.732 --> 00:55:23.837
And if we could just control the Chinese.

839
00:55:23.872 --> 00:55:26.426
we could control this plague.

840
00:55:30.396 --> 00:55:33.226
People had that sense of doubt.

841
00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:37.644
Is this the way in which
the health officials

842
00:55:37.679 --> 00:55:41.027
who never cared about our
wellbeing want to eradicate us?

843
00:55:44.099 --> 00:55:49.484
Once more. the Chinese
turned to the most powerful tool they had.

844
00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:55.006
They file suit again.

845
00:55:55.041 --> 00:55:56.491
And this leads to

846
00:55:56.525 --> 00:56:00.667
the second case.
Jew Ho vs. Williamson.

847
00:56:00.702 --> 00:56:04.188
And. again. Kinyoun was a named defendant.

848
00:56:04.222 --> 00:56:06.535
A grocer on Stockton Street.

849
00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:11.402
Jew Ho noticed that the
quarantine lines were not drawn

850
00:56:11.437 --> 00:56:15.268
in a straight line around
all businesses in the region.

851
00:56:15.302 --> 00:56:20.307
that they zigged and zagged
to exclude white merchants.

852
00:56:20.342 --> 00:56:26.106
And was specifically designed
not to protect the health

853
00:56:26.141 --> 00:56:29.938
of an entire district.
but to isolate the Chinese.

854
00:56:32.285 --> 00:56:34.770
The quarantine
line was along Stockton Street.

855
00:56:34.805 --> 00:56:37.566
so the cannery was in quarantine.

856
00:56:37.601 --> 00:56:41.536
And the white workers. women and girls.

857
00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:43.192
employed by Lew Hing

858
00:56:43.227 --> 00:56:47.058
in the cannery. they were
allowed to come and go.

859
00:56:47.093 --> 00:56:50.130
but not the Chinese.

860
00:56:50.165 --> 00:56:51.822
The judge says.

861
00:56:51.856 --> 00:56:54.100
it's very clear that the
Caucasians on the perimeter

862
00:56:54.134 --> 00:56:55.688
are being treated differently.

863
00:56:55.722 --> 00:56:56.861
And it has to do with whether this is

864
00:56:56.896 --> 00:56:59.554
a reasonable exercise of the police power.

865
00:56:59.588 --> 00:57:01.210
And again. the court says no. it isn't

866
00:57:01.245 --> 00:57:04.213
because the Chinese are not
being protected at all.

867
00:57:04.248 --> 00:57:07.251
They're not being prevented from
intermingling with each other;

868
00:57:07.285 --> 00:57:10.047
the individuals who had contact
with these people

869
00:57:10.081 --> 00:57:12.256
who died of the plague
have not been quarantined.

870
00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:14.465
So. if the idea is to prevent

871
00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:16.122
the spread of a contagious disease.

872
00:57:16.156 --> 00:57:18.089
isn't this an unreasonable way to do it?

873
00:57:31.275 --> 00:57:32.690
A day after the ruling.

874
00:57:32.725 --> 00:57:35.452
Kinyoun imposed a sweeping travel ban

875
00:57:35.486 --> 00:57:39.179
on all Californians. regardless of race.

876
00:57:39.214 --> 00:57:41.941
This meant no one could leave the state

877
00:57:41.975 --> 00:57:44.461
without a health certificate from him.

878
00:57:45.945 --> 00:57:50.397
And. of course. that made him
a menace to the entire city

879
00:57:50.432 --> 00:57:53.297
and the whole state of California.

880
00:57:55.264 --> 00:57:58.785
Dr. Kinyoun
was a top-down officer.

881
00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:04.377
He led by issuing
sound scientific diagnoses.

882
00:58:04.411 --> 00:58:06.759
That plays very well in the lab.

883
00:58:06.793 --> 00:58:08.346
and not so well on the street.

884
00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:16.423
Three days later. on June 19. 1900.

885
00:58:16.458 --> 00:58:18.633
Kinyoun was dealt a stunning rebuke.

886
00:58:18.667 --> 00:58:22.775
President William McKinley
was forced to apologize

887
00:58:22.809 --> 00:58:24.984
to enraged state legislators

888
00:58:25.018 --> 00:58:27.504
for the actions of his federal officer

889
00:58:27.538 --> 00:58:29.713
and swiftly revoked the travel ban.

890
00:58:31.369 --> 00:58:33.406
Desperate to do the right thing.

891
00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:36.305
Kinyoun had played his biggest card

892
00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.410
and lost.

893
00:58:41.621 --> 00:58:44.590
But the situation only worsened.

894
00:58:44.624 --> 00:58:48.801
Until now. there had been
13 confirmed plague deaths.

895
00:58:48.835 --> 00:58:50.768
all Chinese.

896
00:58:50.803 --> 00:58:52.770
From the beginning.

897
00:58:52.805 --> 00:58:54.772
racial pseudoscience had lulled many

898
00:58:54.807 --> 00:58:57.568
into the complacency of ignorance.

899
00:58:57.603 --> 00:59:00.191
What's more. the disease came and went

900
00:59:00.226 --> 00:59:03.885
in mysterious and inexplicable waves.

901
00:59:03.919 --> 00:59:07.958
Kinyoun feared that the plague
was spreading in darkness.

902
00:59:07.992 --> 00:59:10.685
This was confirmed in mid-August

903
00:59:10.719 --> 00:59:13.964
when the first known white
victim. William Murphy.

904
00:59:13.998 --> 00:59:17.830
fell ill and died.

905
00:59:17.864 --> 00:59:21.592
A worker who routinely made
deliveries to Chinatown.

906
00:59:21.627 --> 00:59:25.216
he was succeeded that fall
by another non-Chinese victim.

907
00:59:25.251 --> 00:59:28.012
a nurse at the children's hospital.

908
00:59:28.047 --> 00:59:30.325
who had never been to the district.

909
00:59:34.743 --> 00:59:37.643
Panicked that the disease had
begun to spread

910
00:59:37.677 --> 00:59:42.371
beyond Chinatown. Kinyoun put
all his men on high alert.

911
00:59:43.821 --> 00:59:47.618
Late that September.
a steamship called the Coptic

912
00:59:47.653 --> 00:59:51.484
arrived from Hawaii
and docked at Angel Island.

913
00:59:51.518 --> 00:59:56.834
An overzealous health official
ordered that all passengers.

914
00:59:56.869 --> 01:00:00.424
rich and poor. male and female alike.

915
01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:02.460
be strip-searched en masse

916
01:00:02.495 --> 01:00:05.187
and examined for buboes
in the armpits and groin.

917
01:00:07.465 --> 01:00:10.572
First-class passengers were outraged.

918
01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:13.817
and vowed to never again sail
into San Francisco

919
01:00:13.851 --> 01:00:16.923
as long as Kinyoun was in charge.

920
01:00:16.958 --> 01:00:18.753
And now.

921
01:00:18.787 --> 01:00:21.238
everyone is out for blood.

922
01:00:23.516 --> 01:00:25.311
The state senate in California.

923
01:00:25.345 --> 01:00:27.520
say that Kinyoun should be hung
for what he's doing.

924
01:00:29.729 --> 01:00:32.180
He had been decried

925
01:00:32.214 --> 01:00:35.286
by the politicians. by the press.

926
01:00:35.321 --> 01:00:38.669
The legislators want him to leave.

927
01:00:38.704 --> 01:00:40.671
lobbying the federal government

928
01:00:40.706 --> 01:00:43.225
for his transfer out of the city.

929
01:00:45.158 --> 01:00:48.334
By now. Dr. Kinyoun had been
smacked down in the courts.

930
01:00:49.576 --> 01:00:53.580
He was defending his hypothesis.
his diagnosis.

931
01:00:53.615 --> 01:00:57.999
his standing in the
Marine Hospital Service.

932
01:00:58.033 --> 01:01:01.071
So he's literally
a man under fire. besieged.

933
01:01:04.039 --> 01:01:08.526
It appears to me
that commercial interests of San Francisco

934
01:01:08.561 --> 01:01:12.116
are more dear to the inhabitants

935
01:01:12.151 --> 01:01:16.534
than the preservation of human life.

936
01:01:16.569 --> 01:01:20.815
I am at war with everybody out here.

937
01:01:20.849 --> 01:01:23.024
Joseph Kinyoun.

938
01:01:25.785 --> 01:01:31.446
California's Governor Gage spun
a fantastic conspiracy theory.

939
01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.036
He said that Dr. Kinyoun
and the federal doctors

940
01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:38.971
had actually created a fake plague

941
01:01:39.005 --> 01:01:42.664
by injecting corpses with plague bacteria

942
01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:44.183
that they had secretly imported.

943
01:01:45.391 --> 01:01:48.221
That it was all made up.

944
01:01:49.878 --> 01:01:53.986
And he planted the seed of doubt
in people's mind.

945
01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.784
This was too much for
Dr. Kinyoun.

946
01:01:58.818 --> 01:02:02.442
And in despair and anger.

947
01:02:02.477 --> 01:02:04.168
he wired his boss.

948
01:02:04.203 --> 01:02:06.619
Surgeon General Walter Wyman. and said.

949
01:02:06.653 --> 01:02:11.417
"Please defend me from
this slander against myself

950
01:02:11.451 --> 01:02:12.659
and the Marine Hospital
Service."

951
01:02:16.111 --> 01:02:20.046
But Wyman chose to remain silent.

952
01:02:20.081 --> 01:02:24.775
Kinyoun was left defenseless.
and utterly alone.

953
01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:28.779
In despair. he wrote to a colleague.

954
01:02:30.885 --> 01:02:33.715
My exoneration rests upon

955
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:37.650
Dr. Wyman openly avowing
his responsibility

956
01:02:37.684 --> 01:02:40.895
for my official actions.

957
01:02:40.929 --> 01:02:46.624
This he should. if he possesses
the courage of a man.

958
01:02:46.659 --> 01:02:52.113
All these years I have stood
loyally by his side...

959
01:02:52.147 --> 01:02:56.289
keeping his political head
from rolling into the basket.

960
01:03:00.017 --> 01:03:03.641
It took a lot of stamina

961
01:03:03.676 --> 01:03:07.507
and guts to stay the course.
that what he believed in.

962
01:03:07.542 --> 01:03:10.269
'Cause he knew it. where
everybody else doubted him.

963
01:03:13.306 --> 01:03:17.069
Barely nine months
since his first forensic diagnosis.

964
01:03:17.103 --> 01:03:21.936
Kinyoun confirmed the 22nd
known plague casualty.

965
01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:25.905
Seeking vindication.
he now demanded a thorough.

966
01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:29.288
outside investigation into
the truth of the matter.

967
01:03:29.322 --> 01:03:31.324
Meanwhile.

968
01:03:31.359 --> 01:03:34.189
word of San Francisco's troubles

969
01:03:34.224 --> 01:03:37.330
continued to spread across the country.

970
01:03:37.365 --> 01:03:40.506
It became obvious
to everybody in the country

971
01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:42.128
that San Francisco had an epidemic

972
01:03:42.163 --> 01:03:43.129
and they weren't admitting to it.

973
01:03:44.993 --> 01:03:47.202
The federal government
and the state government

974
01:03:47.237 --> 01:03:50.896
of California were at a standoff.

975
01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:53.036
So. a deal was cut that there would be

976
01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:55.141
a neutral federal commission.

977
01:03:55.176 --> 01:03:58.213
Three of the most prominent
bacteriologists

978
01:03:58.248 --> 01:04:01.596
in the United States would go
west to investigate

979
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:05.462
and find out whether there
really was a plague epidemic.

980
01:04:05.496 --> 01:04:07.257
and whether Kinyoun was doing
the right things

981
01:04:07.291 --> 01:04:09.742
or the wrong things.

982
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.507
Kinyoun. was
looking for that sense of validation.

983
01:04:16.542 --> 01:04:20.373
He felt like he was 2.000 miles away

984
01:04:20.408 --> 01:04:23.894
from anybody he'd consider
his peer who he trusted.

985
01:04:23.929 --> 01:04:26.724
You know. "Finally. here are
people who care about science.

986
01:04:26.759 --> 01:04:30.176
"who care about medicine.

987
01:04:30.211 --> 01:04:31.660
"And now I'm going to be validated.

988
01:04:31.695 --> 01:04:33.179
"and we're going to save.
you know. thousands.

989
01:04:33.214 --> 01:04:34.422
if not millions. of lives."

990
01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:39.082
When the three-man
commission arrived in San Francisco

991
01:04:39.116 --> 01:04:41.878
in late January 1901.

992
01:04:41.912 --> 01:04:45.882
they felt the full urgency
of their mission.

993
01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.091
Sensing they had to penetrate Chinatown.

994
01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:51.853
they immediately hired a local
translator and go-between.

995
01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:56.409
a former Six Companies
secretary named Wong Chung.

996
01:04:56.444 --> 01:05:00.966
He was the link
between medical establishment.

997
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.761
San Francisco establishment.

998
01:05:03.796 --> 01:05:07.904
the Chinese Six Companies.
and Chinatown itself.

999
01:05:10.009 --> 01:05:12.115
The move paid off.

1000
01:05:12.149 --> 01:05:14.911
With the help of Wong Chung.

1001
01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:17.534
and with Kinyoun safely on Angel Island.

1002
01:05:17.568 --> 01:05:19.605
the commission was quickly able to gain

1003
01:05:19.639 --> 01:05:21.918
what had been missing for months:

1004
01:05:21.952 --> 01:05:24.782
not just trust. but access.

1005
01:05:27.095 --> 01:05:31.858
Within weeks.
they confirmed six new cases.

1006
01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:35.655
When Governor Henry Gage

1007
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:40.281
learned of the commission's
upcoming report. he panicked.

1008
01:05:40.315 --> 01:05:44.768
He hastily made a trip to
Washington D.C..

1009
01:05:44.802 --> 01:05:46.356
accompanied by a hand-picked army

1010
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:48.116
of the most powerful men in California:

1011
01:05:48.151 --> 01:05:49.842
senators.

1012
01:05:49.876 --> 01:05:51.395
newspaper editors.

1013
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:53.432
and business leaders.

1014
01:05:55.123 --> 01:06:00.232
When he arrived in Washington. he visited

1015
01:06:00.266 --> 01:06:05.616
Surgeon General Walter Wyman.
and he proposed a quid pro quo.

1016
01:06:05.651 --> 01:06:08.999
He said. "We will clean up
the city of San Francisco

1017
01:06:09.034 --> 01:06:12.727
"if you keep the existence of plague

1018
01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:15.247
secret from the nation."

1019
01:06:17.318 --> 01:06:19.354
Both sides had much to gain.

1020
01:06:19.389 --> 01:06:21.839
California needed the White House

1021
01:06:21.874 --> 01:06:23.600
to put an end to the matter

1022
01:06:23.634 --> 01:06:27.466
that was threatening to take
down its economy and reputation.

1023
01:06:30.193 --> 01:06:32.609
And McKinley needed the vote-rich state

1024
01:06:32.643 --> 01:06:36.130
to ensure his upcoming bid
for re-election.

1025
01:06:36.164 --> 01:06:41.928
All of the men now agreed:
one hand would wash the other.

1026
01:06:43.689 --> 01:06:45.725
And this unholy deal

1027
01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.556
was undertaken in the office

1028
01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:50.006
of the President of the United States...

1029
01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:55.804
President McKinley. in concert
with senior Republican leaders.

1030
01:06:55.839 --> 01:06:58.773
including those from California.

1031
01:06:58.807 --> 01:07:03.019
And they struck a deal
with the surgeon general to maintain

1032
01:07:03.053 --> 01:07:05.676
what Dr. Walter Wyman.
surgeon general.

1033
01:07:05.711 --> 01:07:07.471
called a perfect seal of silence.

1034
01:07:07.506 --> 01:07:10.647
They would hush it up.

1035
01:07:16.101 --> 01:07:18.827
On March 6. 1901.

1036
01:07:18.862 --> 01:07:23.315
exactly one year since
Wong Chut King's death.

1037
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:24.937
a local headline blared

1038
01:07:24.971 --> 01:07:28.009
an unexpected and scandalous scoop.

1039
01:07:28.975 --> 01:07:31.909
Reporters broke news

1040
01:07:31.944 --> 01:07:35.913
of this infamous pact signed by
the surgeon general

1041
01:07:35.948 --> 01:07:37.087
and the governor of California.

1042
01:07:38.951 --> 01:07:44.439
And word got out about this cover-up.

1043
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:54.794
Wyman found
himself in an uncomfortable position.

1044
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:59.454
Yet he also knew that much
of the vitriol aimed at the MHS

1045
01:07:59.489 --> 01:08:03.493
had been greatly exacerbated
by Kinyoun's actions.

1046
01:08:03.527 --> 01:08:08.187
His perceived lack of diplomacy
was all anyone could talk about.

1047
01:08:10.224 --> 01:08:12.571
Kinyoun had to be thrown under the bus.

1048
01:08:12.605 --> 01:08:14.538
And so he was removed from his job

1049
01:08:14.573 --> 01:08:17.817
without any real explanation for why.

1050
01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:26.688
In May 1901. Kinyoun
was ordered without thanks. fanfare.

1051
01:08:26.723 --> 01:08:31.245
or even notice. to pack up his
family and relocate to Detroit.

1052
01:08:33.971 --> 01:08:37.975
He had spent two long years
trying to protect the country.

1053
01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:40.737
and seemingly all in vain.

1054
01:08:42.946 --> 01:08:45.190
It was such a devastating blow

1055
01:08:45.224 --> 01:08:50.091
because it basically ended his
scientific career in many ways.

1056
01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:53.163
He did not get to go back
to his beloved lab.

1057
01:08:53.198 --> 01:08:54.544
And I think that was devastating.

1058
01:08:56.856 --> 01:08:59.825
And I think he
believed he had spent his life

1059
01:08:59.859 --> 01:09:02.828
doing really good things.
and he was very proud of that.

1060
01:09:02.862 --> 01:09:05.071
And I think to be thrown under the bus

1061
01:09:05.106 --> 01:09:07.936
was probably devastating to him.

1062
01:09:07.971 --> 01:09:10.491
Because it called into question

1063
01:09:10.525 --> 01:09:12.941
the goodness of all those things
he'd been doing for so long.

1064
01:09:15.427 --> 01:09:17.429
Dr. Kinyoun did the hard work

1065
01:09:17.463 --> 01:09:21.502
of nailing the scientific diagnosis.

1066
01:09:21.536 --> 01:09:24.953
He just couldn't make it stick
in the minds of the populace.

1067
01:09:26.852 --> 01:09:30.511
And he was hurt. he was indignant.

1068
01:09:30.545 --> 01:09:34.480
And being somewhat hot-tempered.
he didn't go quietly.

1069
01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:38.381
He blasted the city.

1070
01:09:38.415 --> 01:09:42.454
blasted Chinatown.
blasted all the authorities.

1071
01:09:44.973 --> 01:09:47.631
Kinyoun had come to San Francisco

1072
01:09:47.666 --> 01:09:51.497
expecting to champion science
and save the country.

1073
01:09:51.532 --> 01:09:55.052
Instead. he had been sent away
in ignominy.

1074
01:09:55.087 --> 01:09:57.676
while the danger still remained.

1075
01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:10.033
With Kinyoun gone.
California turned to happier business.

1076
01:10:10.067 --> 01:10:14.589
As their part of the secret deal
brokered months before.

1077
01:10:14.624 --> 01:10:17.247
state politicians welcomed
President McKinley

1078
01:10:17.282 --> 01:10:20.561
to a lavish. all-expenses-paid junket.

1079
01:10:22.356 --> 01:10:27.153
Meanwhile. Wyman was on the hunt
for a new quarantine officer.

1080
01:10:27.188 --> 01:10:30.674
But after Kinyoun's humiliating ouster.

1081
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:33.436
no one in the MHS community wanted

1082
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:37.612
what they saw as an impossible job.

1083
01:10:41.375 --> 01:10:45.551
He finally settled on a
candidate: Rupert Lee Blue.

1084
01:10:45.586 --> 01:10:50.142
a 32-year old physician from the MHS.

1085
01:10:50.176 --> 01:10:55.112
Unlike Kinyoun. Blue wasn't
a research scientist.

1086
01:10:55.147 --> 01:10:59.013
He lacked Kinyoun's medical
pedigree and rigorous training.

1087
01:10:59.047 --> 01:11:04.260
In fact. he wasn't Wyman's
first or even second choice.

1088
01:11:06.158 --> 01:11:08.333
Rupert Lee Blue.

1089
01:11:08.367 --> 01:11:11.301
or Pert as he was known by his nickname.

1090
01:11:11.336 --> 01:11:12.923
was round-faced and shy.

1091
01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:13.890
He was diffident.

1092
01:11:13.924 --> 01:11:18.204
And he really loved boxing matches.

1093
01:11:19.654 --> 01:11:21.587
Not just as a spectator but also

1094
01:11:21.622 --> 01:11:23.900
as an amateur participant.

1095
01:11:28.732 --> 01:11:31.632
He was preceded by rumors that
he was lazy.

1096
01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:34.151
as one of his colleagues
called him "inert."

1097
01:11:34.186 --> 01:11:36.568
"Inert Pert."

1098
01:11:36.602 --> 01:11:39.950
He was known as kind of affable guy.

1099
01:11:39.985 --> 01:11:42.470
not necessarily the most accomplished.

1100
01:11:42.505 --> 01:11:44.886
Other people thought of him as. you know.

1101
01:11:44.921 --> 01:11:46.923
somebody who is barely getting by.

1102
01:11:46.957 --> 01:11:49.477
but it's hard to be that
critical of somebody you like.

1103
01:11:49.512 --> 01:11:51.237
you know. or somebody who's friendly.

1104
01:11:56.035 --> 01:11:58.348
The sixth of eight children.

1105
01:11:58.383 --> 01:12:01.938
Blue was born three years after
the end of the Civil War

1106
01:12:01.972 --> 01:12:04.285
to a struggling but respected family

1107
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.736
in Marion. South Carolina.

1108
01:12:09.532 --> 01:12:12.500
Blue came from nothing. essentially.

1109
01:12:12.535 --> 01:12:15.572
and grew up in the fields.

1110
01:12:15.607 --> 01:12:18.161
He'd walk with his siblings.

1111
01:12:18.195 --> 01:12:19.818
bursting open watermelons with his fist

1112
01:12:19.852 --> 01:12:21.751
and eating right there in the fields.

1113
01:12:24.443 --> 01:12:27.619
He knew he was not the most favored son.

1114
01:12:27.653 --> 01:12:30.346
His older brother. Victor. was a war hero.

1115
01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:34.350
And the parents idolized Victor.

1116
01:12:34.384 --> 01:12:37.939
Rupert Blue kind of felt that

1117
01:12:37.974 --> 01:12:40.079
"If Victor's purpose in life is to harm.

1118
01:12:40.114 --> 01:12:42.323
perhaps my purpose in life is
to heal."

1119
01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:43.600
So he went into medicine.

1120
01:12:43.635 --> 01:12:47.017
And went to one of the first
public medical schools

1121
01:12:47.052 --> 01:12:48.605
in the U.S.

1122
01:12:51.505 --> 01:12:53.817
He wrote letters to his mom saying.

1123
01:12:53.852 --> 01:12:55.405
"I don't think I can hack it.

1124
01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.338
I can barely survive."

1125
01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.823
And he barely graduated medical school.

1126
01:13:02.516 --> 01:13:04.483
Blue joined the Commissioned Corps

1127
01:13:04.518 --> 01:13:06.209
of the Marine Hospital Service.

1128
01:13:07.624 --> 01:13:10.834
The MHS represented adventure
with a purpose.

1129
01:13:10.869 --> 01:13:14.182
the chance to see a world bigger than that

1130
01:13:14.217 --> 01:13:17.807
of his small-town boyhood.
and to confront diseases

1131
01:13:17.841 --> 01:13:21.224
he had only read about in school.

1132
01:13:21.258 --> 01:13:23.122
As a quarantine officer.

1133
01:13:23.157 --> 01:13:25.953
he tracked yellow fever in Galveston.

1134
01:13:25.987 --> 01:13:29.025
monitored infectious diseases
in Milwaukee.

1135
01:13:29.059 --> 01:13:34.133
and investigated
possible plague cases in Rome.

1136
01:13:34.168 --> 01:13:36.273
He had to work hard.

1137
01:13:36.308 --> 01:13:39.518
Having lost his father to illness.

1138
01:13:39.553 --> 01:13:42.107
he had to send money to his widowed mother

1139
01:13:42.141 --> 01:13:45.800
and to his teenage sisters at home.

1140
01:13:45.835 --> 01:13:47.837
So he was working
in the Marine Hospital Service.

1141
01:13:47.871 --> 01:13:50.391
and also taking all these other side jobs

1142
01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.498
as editor of a medical bulletin
or a newsletter

1143
01:13:53.532 --> 01:13:55.534
just to try to bring in more money.

1144
01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.678
The new posting in San Francisco.

1145
01:14:01.713 --> 01:14:06.096
commercial hub for the nation
and Asia. was a huge step up

1146
01:14:06.131 --> 01:14:09.099
from monitoring shipping fleets
on Lake Michigan.

1147
01:14:09.134 --> 01:14:13.932
It was a high-profile chance
for Blue to prove himself.

1148
01:14:13.966 --> 01:14:19.316
although it came with seemingly
insurmountable obstacles.

1149
01:14:19.351 --> 01:14:24.977
Chinatown feared and distrusted
the MHS and its agents.

1150
01:14:25.012 --> 01:14:30.120
City leaders were openly vying
for their own interests.

1151
01:14:30.155 --> 01:14:33.227
State officials still
refused to acknowledge

1152
01:14:33.261 --> 01:14:35.678
that the disease even existed.

1153
01:14:37.265 --> 01:14:39.578
By June 1901.

1154
01:14:39.613 --> 01:14:43.789
there had been a total
of 34 official plague deaths.

1155
01:14:43.824 --> 01:14:47.621
so Blue knew he had no time to lose.

1156
01:14:49.692 --> 01:14:51.279
The first thing he did.

1157
01:14:51.314 --> 01:14:54.075
he moved into the city and he set up a lab

1158
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:57.527
right on Merchant Street.
which is Chinatown.

1159
01:14:57.562 --> 01:15:00.150
and he was comfortable there.

1160
01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:04.120
He would literally just walk into shops

1161
01:15:04.154 --> 01:15:05.604
and start talking to people

1162
01:15:05.639 --> 01:15:07.606
and trying to make those
kinds of friendships

1163
01:15:07.641 --> 01:15:09.574
and forge those social bonds.

1164
01:15:09.608 --> 01:15:11.921
And Kinyoun. when he went into Chinatown.

1165
01:15:11.955 --> 01:15:15.200
he had to have a protection
of armed officers.

1166
01:15:15.234 --> 01:15:18.928
Blue. he would walk down
the streets by himself.

1167
01:15:24.278 --> 01:15:27.315
Blue also kept on Wong Chung.

1168
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:31.181
the interpreter who had assisted
the federal commission.

1169
01:15:31.216 --> 01:15:33.805
And since he knew that Chinatown's dead

1170
01:15:33.839 --> 01:15:36.255
seemed to mysteriously vanish.

1171
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:40.397
he talked Surgeon General Wyman
into an unusual expense.

1172
01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:45.506
He arranged for a
horse and buggy to have his own.

1173
01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.404
essentially. morgue service.

1174
01:15:47.439 --> 01:15:48.716
so he could find bodies

1175
01:15:48.751 --> 01:15:50.960
and he could inspect them
as quickly as he could.

1176
01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:54.653
Blue also paid the Chinese translators

1177
01:15:54.688 --> 01:15:57.311
the same as he did as his
white members of the staff.

1178
01:15:57.345 --> 01:16:00.003
which was radical at the time.

1179
01:16:00.038 --> 01:16:02.937
He found himself relying more and more

1180
01:16:02.972 --> 01:16:05.181
on his translator. Wong Chung.

1181
01:16:05.215 --> 01:16:10.082
Not just as a translator and interpreter.

1182
01:16:10.117 --> 01:16:13.258
but also as a sort of cultural liaison.

1183
01:16:13.292 --> 01:16:17.020
So. Wong Chung helped
Dr. Blue understand

1184
01:16:17.055 --> 01:16:21.577
the community's resistance to
Western medical interventions.

1185
01:16:29.239 --> 01:16:32.242
With Wong as his trusted go-between.

1186
01:16:32.277 --> 01:16:36.522
Blue revised the harsh protocol
of his predecessor.

1187
01:16:36.557 --> 01:16:41.597
He disinfected only targeted
houses. not whole streets.

1188
01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:45.186
He quarantined immediate family alone.

1189
01:16:45.221 --> 01:16:48.811
and limited lockdown to the
shortest time possible.

1190
01:16:52.055 --> 01:16:55.127
He was somebody who was willing to listen.

1191
01:16:55.162 --> 01:16:56.784
which was a real skill.

1192
01:16:56.819 --> 01:16:59.304
He knew he wasn't the smartest.

1193
01:16:59.338 --> 01:17:02.031
He knew he didn't necessarily
have insights

1194
01:17:02.065 --> 01:17:04.654
that other people did.
but he was willing to.

1195
01:17:04.689 --> 01:17:05.931
to try everything.

1196
01:17:09.383 --> 01:17:13.559
But what Blue discovered was unnerving.

1197
01:17:13.594 --> 01:17:16.873
In the month of July.
three Japanese prostitutes

1198
01:17:16.908 --> 01:17:20.083
working on the edge of Chinatown died.

1199
01:17:21.775 --> 01:17:24.398
Blue reeled at the thought
that the women had had contact

1200
01:17:24.432 --> 01:17:26.814
with literally dozens
of nameless customers.

1201
01:17:28.954 --> 01:17:31.336
How many were there?

1202
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:33.890
Where did they go?

1203
01:17:33.925 --> 01:17:36.341
Blue was terrified that the disease

1204
01:17:36.375 --> 01:17:39.344
was poised to explode exponentially.

1205
01:17:39.378 --> 01:17:41.829
as he admitted to Wyman.

1206
01:17:41.864 --> 01:17:44.556
It would not be an easy matter

1207
01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:47.835
to trace the source of this infection.

1208
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:51.736
The Chinese seem to know a suspicious case

1209
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:54.808
and depart. like the fleas.

1210
01:17:54.842 --> 01:17:56.016
Rupert Blue.

1211
01:17:56.050 --> 01:18:01.228
On the big map right behind his desk.

1212
01:18:01.262 --> 01:18:02.781
he starts putting red marks

1213
01:18:02.816 --> 01:18:04.024
everywhere there's a known plague victim.

1214
01:18:04.058 --> 01:18:07.510
And that becomes this obsession
to try to prevent

1215
01:18:07.544 --> 01:18:10.582
more red marks from showing up on his map.

1216
01:18:10.616 --> 01:18:14.379
but also to try to find some
kind of connection

1217
01:18:14.413 --> 01:18:16.036
between these victims.

1218
01:18:21.075 --> 01:18:23.112
For the rest of the summer.

1219
01:18:23.146 --> 01:18:26.943
Blue patiently continued
to explore Chinatown.

1220
01:18:26.978 --> 01:18:30.706
always on the lookout for more cases.

1221
01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:41.613
On September 11. 1901.
following a tip from Wong Chung.

1222
01:18:41.647 --> 01:18:44.098
Blue and his men had a rare opportunity.

1223
01:18:45.651 --> 01:18:48.724
In the basement of a grocery store.

1224
01:18:48.758 --> 01:18:52.313
they found a 28-year-old man
with signs of the plague.

1225
01:18:52.348 --> 01:18:56.386
and took him to the Tung Wah
Dispensary for observation.

1226
01:18:56.421 --> 01:18:59.286
Well. friends of the patient

1227
01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:05.602
were about to get him out of
Chinatown to avoid the red tape.

1228
01:19:05.637 --> 01:19:08.157
the inspections. the interventions.

1229
01:19:08.191 --> 01:19:11.574
But Wong Chung's tip enabled
the federal doctors

1230
01:19:11.608 --> 01:19:13.645
to prevent this evasion.

1231
01:19:16.061 --> 01:19:19.237
It was the first
time Blue had had the opportunity

1232
01:19:19.271 --> 01:19:22.827
to examine a living patient.

1233
01:19:22.861 --> 01:19:25.553
Until now. the Chinese had never trusted

1234
01:19:25.588 --> 01:19:27.486
the MHS enough to cooperate.

1235
01:19:27.521 --> 01:19:32.181
Blue was able to isolate the man
and question him

1236
01:19:32.215 --> 01:19:34.942
about his contacts to hopefully learn

1237
01:19:34.977 --> 01:19:37.496
how the disease was being spread.

1238
01:19:39.533 --> 01:19:42.674
Thanks to Wong Chung's quiet diligence.

1239
01:19:42.708 --> 01:19:45.677
Chinatown was starting to open up.

1240
01:19:45.711 --> 01:19:50.130
Cases that had formerly
been hidden or misdiagnosed

1241
01:19:50.164 --> 01:19:52.546
were coming to light.

1242
01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:56.136
leading to a wave of ten more
confirmed diagnoses.

1243
01:20:01.555 --> 01:20:04.351
I am working like a Trojan.

1244
01:20:04.385 --> 01:20:07.941
and I trust that my labors
will be rewarded.

1245
01:20:07.975 --> 01:20:11.565
We are still working quietly.

1246
01:20:11.599 --> 01:20:16.604
avoiding friction with
the state or the Chinese.

1247
01:20:16.639 --> 01:20:18.192
Rupert Blue.

1248
01:20:20.781 --> 01:20:22.369
He soon finds more and more victims.

1249
01:20:22.403 --> 01:20:23.784
He sees living victims.

1250
01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:29.859
He sees more victims quickly
before they can be hidden away.

1251
01:20:29.894 --> 01:20:33.898
So he starts realizing
the scope of the problem.

1252
01:20:33.932 --> 01:20:36.003
So. Wong Chung

1253
01:20:36.038 --> 01:20:39.627
played a pivotal role. and
for this he took many risks.

1254
01:20:42.907 --> 01:20:46.669
The state doctors who denied
the plague existence

1255
01:20:46.703 --> 01:20:50.017
may have tipped Chinatown gangsters

1256
01:20:50.052 --> 01:20:52.192
that Wong Chung was a collaborator.

1257
01:20:52.226 --> 01:20:54.125
a traitor to his community.

1258
01:20:55.643 --> 01:20:58.094
Not that long after.
someone tried to kill him.

1259
01:20:59.716 --> 01:21:01.166
And he had to run for his life.
essentially.

1260
01:21:02.616 --> 01:21:07.897
It took the intervention of Washington.

1261
01:21:07.932 --> 01:21:11.211
and only then was Wong Chung secure

1262
01:21:11.245 --> 01:21:13.385
to go about his medical rounds
with the doctors.

1263
01:21:17.148 --> 01:21:20.668
For 18 months.
Blue. like Kinyoun before him.

1264
01:21:20.703 --> 01:21:23.879
had been confounded by the
low number of fatalities.

1265
01:21:23.913 --> 01:21:27.089
but neither man had had the full picture.

1266
01:21:28.953 --> 01:21:30.437
Blue began to realize

1267
01:21:30.471 --> 01:21:33.198
that white doctors throughout
San Francisco.

1268
01:21:33.233 --> 01:21:34.682
bowing to political pressure.

1269
01:21:34.717 --> 01:21:37.616
were deliberately misdiagnosing cases

1270
01:21:37.651 --> 01:21:41.103
in order to minimize actual numbers.

1271
01:21:43.036 --> 01:21:47.143
Scant courtesy. singular apathy.

1272
01:21:47.178 --> 01:21:50.250
and. in the end. interference.

1273
01:21:50.284 --> 01:21:52.459
have characterized the state health board

1274
01:21:52.493 --> 01:21:56.808
at a time of grave public peril.

1275
01:21:56.842 --> 01:21:58.189
Eradication of the disease

1276
01:21:58.223 --> 01:22:01.882
would be entirely out of the question.

1277
01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:05.851
and the danger of an
indefinite stay is enhanced.

1278
01:22:05.886 --> 01:22:08.440
Rupert Blue.

1279
01:22:10.822 --> 01:22:13.204
By the fall of 1902.

1280
01:22:13.238 --> 01:22:17.277
the number of officially
diagnosed cases had tripled.

1281
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:23.386
At the annual meeting of state
and local health boards

1282
01:22:23.421 --> 01:22:25.354
in New Haven. Connecticut.

1283
01:22:25.388 --> 01:22:29.875
San Francisco was all everyone
talked about.

1284
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:35.502
California officials continued
to deny that the plague existed.

1285
01:22:35.536 --> 01:22:39.437
in direct contradiction to the
MHS and national papers.

1286
01:22:42.371 --> 01:22:48.480
Other state boards of
health started issuing censure votes

1287
01:22:48.515 --> 01:22:53.244
and statements of condemnation
against the state of California.

1288
01:22:53.278 --> 01:22:58.042
against Governor Gage.
against the denial of plague.

1289
01:22:58.076 --> 01:23:02.632
And some radicals even demanded

1290
01:23:02.667 --> 01:23:07.396
that the Navy transfer centers
be moved north to Seattle.

1291
01:23:08.949 --> 01:23:10.606
Well. this was serious.

1292
01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:15.059
San Francisco did not want
to risk such a loss of power.

1293
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:18.510
At this point.

1294
01:23:18.545 --> 01:23:20.996
the denial of plague became costly.

1295
01:23:23.446 --> 01:23:26.070
California had run out of options.

1296
01:23:26.104 --> 01:23:30.039
It was time to face it. and
clean it out. and stamp it out.

1297
01:23:32.593 --> 01:23:35.079
The responsibility
of controlling the plague

1298
01:23:35.113 --> 01:23:37.012
rested squarely on Blue's shoulders.

1299
01:23:39.497 --> 01:23:40.912
Blue's boxing

1300
01:23:40.946 --> 01:23:43.501
taught him how to bob and weave.

1301
01:23:43.535 --> 01:23:44.916
size up his opponents.

1302
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:47.815
anticipating their next move.

1303
01:23:47.850 --> 01:23:50.025
put an edge on his strategic approach.

1304
01:23:52.096 --> 01:23:56.065
Now. he stared
at his map for the hundredth time.

1305
01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:00.483
Every single block in Chinatown
had had a confirmed case.

1306
01:24:03.383 --> 01:24:05.764
But in the previous September.

1307
01:24:05.799 --> 01:24:08.560
a white washerwoman with
no connection to the district

1308
01:24:08.595 --> 01:24:12.771
had died of plague.
and she lived a block away.

1309
01:24:15.326 --> 01:24:18.156
It dawned on Blue
he'd been ignoring something

1310
01:24:18.191 --> 01:24:21.194
that had been right in front
of him the entire time.

1311
01:24:23.851 --> 01:24:26.095
The mystery of why the plague

1312
01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:28.753
had decimated Europe
and Asia for centuries

1313
01:24:28.787 --> 01:24:32.170
was finally beginning to unravel.

1314
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:39.315
For us kids.

1315
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:42.456
one of the great pastimes was
just fishing off

1316
01:24:42.491 --> 01:24:47.323
the piers. which ran almost
right up against Chinatown.

1317
01:24:48.566 --> 01:24:51.500
And ships that were moored to the docks.

1318
01:24:51.534 --> 01:24:53.260
they had these huge ropes.

1319
01:24:55.159 --> 01:24:57.022
You would see rats.

1320
01:24:57.057 --> 01:24:58.679
Rats just coming from the ships

1321
01:24:58.714 --> 01:25:00.336
and coming down those ropes.

1322
01:25:02.062 --> 01:25:04.133
And some of them would just fall
in the water.

1323
01:25:04.168 --> 01:25:07.102
Others were able to find their
way onto the docks.

1324
01:25:08.862 --> 01:25:12.210
They scurried. they were fast.
and they were quick.

1325
01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.358
Rats are biological marvels in many ways

1326
01:25:22.393 --> 01:25:24.636
because they can survive almost anything.

1327
01:25:24.671 --> 01:25:27.225
And they can breed incredibly quickly.

1328
01:25:28.916 --> 01:25:31.643
And a single pair of rats.

1329
01:25:31.678 --> 01:25:34.198
left to reproduce unhampered.

1330
01:25:34.232 --> 01:25:38.478
would become 1.500 in a year.

1331
01:25:41.791 --> 01:25:46.244
In his lab. Blue and his
men had discovered plague germs

1332
01:25:46.279 --> 01:25:50.179
in dead rats that they had dissected.

1333
01:25:50.214 --> 01:25:52.940
He was now struck by the possibility

1334
01:25:52.975 --> 01:25:56.358
that rats themselves
might somehow spread the disease

1335
01:25:56.392 --> 01:25:59.292
as they roamed the city.

1336
01:25:59.326 --> 01:26:01.949
though he still had no idea how.

1337
01:26:04.055 --> 01:26:05.815
And he realizes

1338
01:26:05.850 --> 01:26:07.783
the only way we're going
to save San Francisco

1339
01:26:07.817 --> 01:26:09.750
is if we kill as many rats as possible.

1340
01:26:09.785 --> 01:26:12.995
So. they focus on rat eradication.

1341
01:26:16.136 --> 01:26:19.070
Thanks to Wong Chung's prior outreach.

1342
01:26:19.104 --> 01:26:21.486
the Chinese Six Companies now agreed

1343
01:26:21.521 --> 01:26:23.385
that all Chinatown businesses

1344
01:26:23.419 --> 01:26:25.835
would work with health authorities.

1345
01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:29.494
"People should not be frightened.

1346
01:26:29.529 --> 01:26:32.117
"These physicians are very kind
and gentle.

1347
01:26:32.152 --> 01:26:37.226
Their main emphasis is to go
after the rats."

1348
01:26:39.124 --> 01:26:41.265
"Chung Sai Yat Po Daily."

1349
01:26:45.061 --> 01:26:48.996
The state was assigned to hire inspectors.

1350
01:26:49.031 --> 01:26:50.791
The city would lay traps

1351
01:26:50.826 --> 01:26:54.347
and poisoned bait for rats.

1352
01:26:54.381 --> 01:26:56.003
And they tried to get

1353
01:26:56.038 --> 01:26:59.041
all the citizens involved in
rat collection.

1354
01:26:59.075 --> 01:27:03.045
So they offered 10 cents a rat.

1355
01:27:03.079 --> 01:27:05.012
even 50 cents for a breeding female.

1356
01:27:05.047 --> 01:27:06.635
So. you can imagine this is quite a sum.

1357
01:27:06.669 --> 01:27:11.881
And people got involved in
bringing in rats.

1358
01:27:14.298 --> 01:27:15.368
Blue starts to look

1359
01:27:15.402 --> 01:27:19.682
for where are rats living.

1360
01:27:19.717 --> 01:27:22.271
Let's create as few nesting
spots for a rat as possible.

1361
01:27:22.306 --> 01:27:26.896
Wooden sidewalks provide so many
places for rats to nest.

1362
01:27:26.931 --> 01:27:31.556
So he rips those out and
let's have concrete sidewalks.

1363
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:40.427
At the same time. let's tear
down these remnants of the past.

1364
01:27:40.462 --> 01:27:43.016
buildings that were still up
from the gold rush era.

1365
01:27:45.329 --> 01:27:49.091
And let's have more modern
buildings in their place.

1366
01:27:54.096 --> 01:27:56.754
By the spring of 1905.

1367
01:27:56.788 --> 01:27:59.032
Chinatown was almost completely renovated.

1368
01:28:01.068 --> 01:28:05.935
Blue's team was dismantled. its job done.

1369
01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:09.353
and he was sent to his
new posting in Virginia.

1370
01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:15.876
With no new cases
being reported in over a year.

1371
01:28:15.911 --> 01:28:18.500
as far as everyone was concerned.

1372
01:28:18.534 --> 01:28:20.778
the plague was finally under control.

1373
01:28:23.159 --> 01:28:27.578
Out of the official tally of
119 confirmed cases.

1374
01:28:27.612 --> 01:28:30.097
104 victims were Asian.

1375
01:28:30.132 --> 01:28:32.893
and 15 were non-Asian.

1376
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:38.278
I think it's fair
to say that the true death toll

1377
01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:41.108
is probably ten times as much.
if not more.

1378
01:28:43.179 --> 01:28:47.391
It was more than likely
the accurate number of plague cases

1379
01:28:47.425 --> 01:28:49.116
were under-reported

1380
01:28:49.151 --> 01:28:51.187
because they were entirely

1381
01:28:51.222 --> 01:28:53.362
racially focused on Asian people.

1382
01:29:18.076 --> 01:29:23.081
Just after 5:00 a.m..
April 18. 1906...

1383
01:29:25.118 --> 01:29:29.122
The city was wracked by
a massive earthquake.

1384
01:29:31.262 --> 01:29:35.024
It would have been
7.9 on the Richter scale.

1385
01:29:35.059 --> 01:29:38.303
an extremely dangerous earthquake.

1386
01:29:38.338 --> 01:29:40.823
particularly in a city of unreinforced

1387
01:29:40.858 --> 01:29:42.791
brick and mortar buildings
that simply crumbled.

1388
01:29:48.072 --> 01:29:51.938
Buildings were pancaked. floors collapsed.

1389
01:29:53.664 --> 01:29:55.148
The city was ablaze.

1390
01:29:55.182 --> 01:29:58.910
water mains were broken.

1391
01:29:58.945 --> 01:30:03.121
So. the water reservoirs were
not available to fight fires.

1392
01:30:03.156 --> 01:30:07.022
In a desperate attempt to stop
the advancing flames.

1393
01:30:07.056 --> 01:30:11.060
the city resorted to setting
strategic charges

1394
01:30:11.095 --> 01:30:13.787
to keep the fire from jumping.

1395
01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:16.790
That helped a little bit.

1396
01:30:16.825 --> 01:30:21.830
but some ne'er-do-wells started
dynamiting Chinatown

1397
01:30:21.864 --> 01:30:23.348
indiscriminately.

1398
01:30:23.383 --> 01:30:25.212
destroying buildings even further.

1399
01:30:28.802 --> 01:30:32.979
More than 80%
of San Francisco was destroyed.

1400
01:30:33.013 --> 01:30:36.569
including virtually all of Chinatown.

1401
01:30:40.055 --> 01:30:44.024
There were 3.000 people killed outright.

1402
01:30:44.059 --> 01:30:47.131
Nearly a quarter million injured.

1403
01:30:47.165 --> 01:30:49.547
hundreds of thousands homeless.

1404
01:30:52.792 --> 01:30:55.484
And you had refugees who suddenly

1405
01:30:55.519 --> 01:30:58.142
have to live in places like
Golden Gate Park

1406
01:30:58.176 --> 01:31:00.627
or other makeshift camps.

1407
01:31:03.319 --> 01:31:05.563
People were living out of tents.

1408
01:31:05.598 --> 01:31:08.359
People were living in a village
of earthquake cottages

1409
01:31:08.393 --> 01:31:10.982
built by the Red Cross.

1410
01:31:14.365 --> 01:31:18.611
The Army and Red Cross
handed out crackers and canned milk.

1411
01:31:18.645 --> 01:31:21.752
But when word spread that no such aid

1412
01:31:21.786 --> 01:31:24.030
would be given to the Chinese.

1413
01:31:24.064 --> 01:31:27.654
the community once again turned
to its own devices.

1414
01:31:32.107 --> 01:31:34.143
Four years earlier.

1415
01:31:34.178 --> 01:31:38.527
merchant Lew Hing had moved away
from San Francisco.

1416
01:31:38.562 --> 01:31:43.912
Lew Hing decided
to open a cannery in Oakland.

1417
01:31:43.946 --> 01:31:45.845
away from San Francisco.

1418
01:31:48.572 --> 01:31:53.266
Having been tired of being
harassed by the white media.

1419
01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:57.477
having had to compete against
the white canneries

1420
01:31:57.512 --> 01:31:59.548
that had formed a cartel

1421
01:31:59.583 --> 01:32:01.930
to try and drive all the
independent canneries

1422
01:32:01.964 --> 01:32:05.140
out of business.

1423
01:32:05.174 --> 01:32:06.866
and particularly targeted Lew Hing

1424
01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.903
because he had become such a
force in the cannery business.

1425
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:17.566
When the earthquake hit on April 18.

1426
01:32:17.601 --> 01:32:19.982
the Chinese in San Francisco.
they were refused

1427
01:32:20.017 --> 01:32:27.507
by the white relief agencies
and had no place to go.

1428
01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:30.337
And so many of the Chinese came
to a very small

1429
01:32:30.372 --> 01:32:33.306
Chinese settlement in Oakland

1430
01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:37.344
where my great-grandfather.
who had some vacant areas

1431
01:32:37.379 --> 01:32:38.932
around his cannery.

1432
01:32:38.967 --> 01:32:44.110
he then hired people to cook.

1433
01:32:44.144 --> 01:32:48.701
and was able to feed thousands
of the Chinese who came over.

1434
01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:59.815
San Francisco
was staggering to regain its footing

1435
01:32:59.850 --> 01:33:02.197
amidst the devastation.

1436
01:33:03.647 --> 01:33:05.372
And the fallout continued to escalate.

1437
01:33:08.168 --> 01:33:11.551
You had instant problems with sanitation.

1438
01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:13.208
If you didn't die from the earthquake.

1439
01:33:13.242 --> 01:33:14.899
or die from the fire.

1440
01:33:14.934 --> 01:33:16.798
you might die from diphtheria or smallpox

1441
01:33:16.832 --> 01:33:18.144
or all these other diseases

1442
01:33:18.178 --> 01:33:21.078
that could rear their head very quickly.

1443
01:33:21.112 --> 01:33:23.045
With the sewer pipes ruptured.

1444
01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.738
rats. including plague-infected ones.

1445
01:33:25.772 --> 01:33:28.223
were released into the city to feast

1446
01:33:28.257 --> 01:33:31.329
on the uncollected refuse.
and breed in the ruins.

1447
01:33:32.537 --> 01:33:33.918
So once again.

1448
01:33:33.953 --> 01:33:37.025
there was a resurgence of rats
and rat-born plague.

1449
01:33:39.165 --> 01:33:42.064
Thirteen months after the earthquake.

1450
01:33:42.099 --> 01:33:45.792
San Francisco had its first
plague death in three years.

1451
01:33:47.242 --> 01:33:49.727
By summer. there were six more.

1452
01:33:49.762 --> 01:33:52.385
Wyman immediately wired Blue.

1453
01:33:52.419 --> 01:33:55.664
and ordered him to return
to San Francisco.

1454
01:33:58.425 --> 01:34:01.394
On this otherwise
unassuming residential street

1455
01:34:01.428 --> 01:34:05.640
in a Victorian house. Dr. Blue
set up his new headquarters.

1456
01:34:05.674 --> 01:34:09.022
and from there. he ran his command center.

1457
01:34:11.646 --> 01:34:13.337
The problem they find very quickly

1458
01:34:13.371 --> 01:34:16.685
is that plague is no longer
a Chinatown problem.

1459
01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.687
it's a San Francisco problem.

1460
01:34:20.275 --> 01:34:22.587
In stark contrast to the early days.

1461
01:34:22.622 --> 01:34:26.591
there was now only one Chinese casualty:

1462
01:34:26.626 --> 01:34:29.698
the president of
the Chinese Six Companies.

1463
01:34:29.733 --> 01:34:32.494
And that's when Blue starts hearing

1464
01:34:32.528 --> 01:34:34.703
from white physicians who say.

1465
01:34:34.738 --> 01:34:38.086
"Perhaps I have seen plague cases before.

1466
01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:40.502
"and I just thought it was pneumonia.

1467
01:34:40.536 --> 01:34:41.814
"Or actually. maybe I knew it was plague

1468
01:34:41.848 --> 01:34:43.539
and I didn't want to admit it."

1469
01:34:43.574 --> 01:34:46.301
And this kind of solidifies for Blue

1470
01:34:46.335 --> 01:34:49.994
this was a disease of the environment.

1471
01:34:50.029 --> 01:34:54.102
Now bubonic plague began to emerge

1472
01:34:54.136 --> 01:34:58.485
in all sorts of different
communities across the Bay Area.

1473
01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:02.075
And people began to realize that
anyone could get bubonic plague.

1474
01:35:04.802 --> 01:35:07.529
Blue set up a special workplace

1475
01:35:07.563 --> 01:35:10.118
dedicated to the grisly task at hand.

1476
01:35:11.567 --> 01:35:12.948
In back of

1477
01:35:12.983 --> 01:35:15.744
the federal headquarters was an
annex to the building

1478
01:35:15.779 --> 01:35:16.987
that became known as the Rattery.

1479
01:35:18.782 --> 01:35:21.577
And the Rattery was essentially
a coroner's lab.

1480
01:35:21.612 --> 01:35:24.097
a forensic lab. just for rats.

1481
01:35:26.582 --> 01:35:30.241
That's where all
the rat carcasses were brought.

1482
01:35:30.276 --> 01:35:34.314
And it's just rat after rat
that's dissected and opened up

1483
01:35:34.349 --> 01:35:37.179
and examined for signs of the plague.

1484
01:35:37.214 --> 01:35:38.663
And they would chart. you know.

1485
01:35:38.698 --> 01:35:40.355
what percentage of rats are infected.

1486
01:35:42.598 --> 01:35:46.913
By the fall. there
were 30 new plague deaths.

1487
01:35:46.948 --> 01:35:49.813
Blue and his men stepped up
their campaign.

1488
01:35:49.847 --> 01:35:52.091
killing more than 13.000 rats a week.

1489
01:35:53.333 --> 01:35:56.164
Throughout. he kept trying out new ways

1490
01:35:56.198 --> 01:35:59.270
to determine how the disease
was spreading through the city.

1491
01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:04.862
They even took it a step further

1492
01:36:04.897 --> 01:36:08.693
and tried to analyze migratory patterns.

1493
01:36:08.728 --> 01:36:11.766
They wanted to find out where
the rats originated

1494
01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:14.838
and where they traveled.

1495
01:36:14.872 --> 01:36:16.598
So. they devised a program

1496
01:36:16.632 --> 01:36:19.946
that came to be nicknamed
the rainbow rats.

1497
01:36:19.981 --> 01:36:23.018
and they got a group of healthy.
active rats

1498
01:36:23.053 --> 01:36:25.434
and dyed them red. green. or blue.

1499
01:36:25.469 --> 01:36:27.264
depending upon what district
they were from.

1500
01:36:27.298 --> 01:36:28.575
and turned them loose.

1501
01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:31.578
Then they would try to catch
them at the other end

1502
01:36:31.613 --> 01:36:35.859
and find out how they were spreading.

1503
01:36:35.893 --> 01:36:37.515
And. of course.

1504
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:39.690
when the raucous local press found out.

1505
01:36:39.724 --> 01:36:41.519
they just had a field day.

1506
01:36:43.867 --> 01:36:46.801
The newspapers
mock them for this immediately.

1507
01:36:46.835 --> 01:36:51.046
It almost sounds like something
out of Dr. Seuss.

1508
01:36:51.081 --> 01:36:55.188
And Blue shrinks very quickly
from this public mockery.

1509
01:36:55.223 --> 01:36:56.155
He's not used to that.

1510
01:36:59.468 --> 01:37:01.470
But he continues to try.

1511
01:37:04.025 --> 01:37:07.960
Then a local case caught Blue's eye.

1512
01:37:07.994 --> 01:37:11.170
There was a physician who had perceived

1513
01:37:11.204 --> 01:37:14.414
a bad smell in his house.

1514
01:37:14.449 --> 01:37:17.797
The doctor decided he would chop
out a hole in the wall

1515
01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:21.283
and get to the source
of this unpleasant odor.

1516
01:37:21.318 --> 01:37:24.597
And there he found two dead rats.

1517
01:37:24.631 --> 01:37:28.601
And immediately. two members
of the family got the plague.

1518
01:37:31.742 --> 01:37:35.263
As Blue pondered the details of this case.

1519
01:37:35.297 --> 01:37:36.954
he recalled reading a recent report

1520
01:37:36.989 --> 01:37:39.094
from the British Plague Commission

1521
01:37:39.129 --> 01:37:41.545
that confirmed the results of a study

1522
01:37:41.579 --> 01:37:43.547
completed ten years earlier.

1523
01:37:46.446 --> 01:37:49.104
Pasteur Institute scientist

1524
01:37:49.139 --> 01:37:50.899
Paul Louis Simond did this experiment.

1525
01:37:50.934 --> 01:37:55.490
He put two rats in cages side
by side. separated by a grate.

1526
01:37:55.524 --> 01:37:57.147
They couldn't touch one another.

1527
01:37:57.181 --> 01:38:00.115
One rat was healthy. one rat was
sick with the plague.

1528
01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:03.360
And Simond made
the breakthrough observation

1529
01:38:03.394 --> 01:38:05.603
that when the plague rat died.

1530
01:38:05.638 --> 01:38:08.572
the fleas jumped to the side
of the healthy rat

1531
01:38:08.606 --> 01:38:10.470
for their next blood meal.

1532
01:38:12.231 --> 01:38:16.131
Bubonic plague
is transmitted by Yersinia pestis.

1533
01:38:16.166 --> 01:38:21.516
The flea itself is really
the host of Yersinia pestis.

1534
01:38:21.550 --> 01:38:25.658
And when it seeks a blood meal
on its natural host.

1535
01:38:25.692 --> 01:38:27.902
it regurgitates its bacteria

1536
01:38:27.936 --> 01:38:30.559
and transmits plague.

1537
01:38:33.114 --> 01:38:36.393
And it's only when its own host dies.

1538
01:38:36.427 --> 01:38:37.704
the flea seeks another warm body.

1539
01:38:37.739 --> 01:38:44.366
a rat. or if a human comes by.
they'll jump on.

1540
01:38:44.401 --> 01:38:47.231
It senses that there's something
warm here.

1541
01:38:47.266 --> 01:38:48.232
"I don't care what it is."

1542
01:38:50.303 --> 01:38:51.615
And then they'll bite.

1543
01:38:51.649 --> 01:38:55.239
They'll try to feed. because it's hungry.

1544
01:38:55.274 --> 01:38:56.965
So. the cause of the transmission

1545
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.726
between rats and human was the flea.

1546
01:39:02.074 --> 01:39:03.834
Blue was thunderstruck

1547
01:39:03.868 --> 01:39:05.180
by the realization

1548
01:39:05.215 --> 01:39:07.355
that fleas played the primary role

1549
01:39:07.389 --> 01:39:08.804
in transmitting the disease.

1550
01:39:11.083 --> 01:39:15.742
Rats. he now understood.
were only agents of the epidemic

1551
01:39:15.777 --> 01:39:19.505
because of the insects in their fur.

1552
01:39:19.539 --> 01:39:22.301
And pieces fell into place:

1553
01:39:22.335 --> 01:39:24.544
the peaks of the outbreak lined up

1554
01:39:24.579 --> 01:39:27.099
with the flea's active season.

1555
01:39:27.133 --> 01:39:33.139
The baffling on-again. off-again
pattern became crystal clear.

1556
01:39:33.174 --> 01:39:36.625
So. the bubonic plague bacilla

1557
01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:39.974
was best conveyed by fleas
on rats biting humans.

1558
01:39:41.182 --> 01:39:45.358
That transmission was the most
important thing.

1559
01:39:45.393 --> 01:39:49.086
So. the eradication of rats
would be pretty significant.

1560
01:39:51.744 --> 01:39:54.712
As the city continued to rebuild.

1561
01:39:54.747 --> 01:39:59.131
Blue knew that public support
for rat extermination was solid.

1562
01:40:00.546 --> 01:40:05.413
Still. without full buy-in
from the entire community.

1563
01:40:05.447 --> 01:40:09.175
the stream of rats
would continue unchecked.

1564
01:40:09.210 --> 01:40:12.661
It was time for extreme measures.

1565
01:40:12.696 --> 01:40:14.870
Rupert Blue the strategist

1566
01:40:14.905 --> 01:40:16.907
understood he needed both
a carrot and a stick.

1567
01:40:16.941 --> 01:40:20.600
So fleet week was approaching.

1568
01:40:20.635 --> 01:40:26.365
But Blue told the city. if the
city isn't a healthful place.

1569
01:40:26.399 --> 01:40:31.577
I will tell the admiral that
it's not safe to land his ships.

1570
01:40:31.611 --> 01:40:35.339
This was terrible news.

1571
01:40:35.374 --> 01:40:37.755
It would be like canceling Christmas.

1572
01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:40.793
to have the Great White Fleet barred

1573
01:40:40.827 --> 01:40:43.278
from entering San Francisco. and worse yet

1574
01:40:43.313 --> 01:40:46.074
diverted to Seattle. the rival city.

1575
01:40:46.109 --> 01:40:48.007
would have been terrible.

1576
01:40:48.042 --> 01:40:52.598
So. all the city had to take part.

1577
01:40:54.358 --> 01:40:58.500
In 1908. the first truly grassroots.

1578
01:40:58.535 --> 01:41:04.092
fully public. multi-sector
health campaign was born.

1579
01:41:04.127 --> 01:41:06.957
Educating the populace on simple things

1580
01:41:06.991 --> 01:41:10.202
like the right way to dispose of garbage.

1581
01:41:11.962 --> 01:41:15.897
You have to seal your household
and security against rats.

1582
01:41:15.931 --> 01:41:18.382
They also educated greengrocers
on the right way

1583
01:41:18.417 --> 01:41:20.315
to store their wares

1584
01:41:20.350 --> 01:41:22.110
to keep the city streets clean.

1585
01:41:22.145 --> 01:41:27.011
And they informed essential
nature of sanitary precautions.

1586
01:41:28.737 --> 01:41:31.292
They start putting
notices in everybody's mailboxes.

1587
01:41:31.326 --> 01:41:36.331
Like. this is what you can do to
save yourself and save the city.

1588
01:41:36.366 --> 01:41:39.023
And little by little.

1589
01:41:39.058 --> 01:41:41.060
hundreds and hundreds of citizens

1590
01:41:41.095 --> 01:41:43.131
from all walks of life.

1591
01:41:43.166 --> 01:41:44.305
churches.

1592
01:41:44.339 --> 01:41:46.824
temples. lodges.

1593
01:41:46.859 --> 01:41:50.034
women's clubs. business groups.

1594
01:41:50.069 --> 01:41:52.244
everyone got on board and did their part.

1595
01:41:55.523 --> 01:41:57.628
San Francisco got to work.

1596
01:41:57.663 --> 01:42:02.461
Long-neglected sanitary
infrastructure was rebuilt.

1597
01:42:02.495 --> 01:42:07.949
A $4 million bond was issued
to renovate the sewer system.

1598
01:42:07.983 --> 01:42:12.333
and municipal garbage collection
and disposal were put in place.

1599
01:42:14.749 --> 01:42:17.476
By now. even the local newspapers

1600
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:19.340
supported the sanitation drive

1601
01:42:19.374 --> 01:42:21.273
by publishing the names and addresses

1602
01:42:21.307 --> 01:42:23.413
of anyone who failed to comply.

1603
01:42:25.069 --> 01:42:26.830
In the end.

1604
01:42:26.864 --> 01:42:31.938
Blue managed to have more
than 20.000 houses inspected.

1605
01:42:31.973 --> 01:42:36.115
Untold numbers of rats were
either trapped or found dead.

1606
01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:38.324
But of the ones tested.

1607
01:42:38.359 --> 01:42:41.465
only 16 were found to be infected.

1608
01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:44.434
The outbreak was in retreat.

1609
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:50.647
With backbreaking work.
and focused messaging.

1610
01:42:50.681 --> 01:42:53.788
Blue had finally rounded
the corner on the disease.

1611
01:43:04.281 --> 01:43:07.526
The question that had so long
tormented Kinyoun and Blue...

1612
01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:11.081
why hadn't the plague taken off
exponentially?

1613
01:43:11.115 --> 01:43:13.325
was at last answered.

1614
01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:22.057
It's so interesting that we had the germ

1615
01:43:22.092 --> 01:43:25.647
that was just as lethal
as during the Black Death.

1616
01:43:25.682 --> 01:43:30.169
The same germ that had ravaged
populations in China.

1617
01:43:30.204 --> 01:43:35.243
and India. what may have
saved the city in the end

1618
01:43:35.278 --> 01:43:37.487
from a much worse disaster

1619
01:43:37.521 --> 01:43:41.387
was a tiny part of an organ
inside of the little flea.

1620
01:43:43.527 --> 01:43:46.220
In places where you
had this explosion of plague.

1621
01:43:46.254 --> 01:43:48.912
there was a different species of rat flea.

1622
01:43:48.946 --> 01:43:51.501
Its anatomy was slightly different.

1623
01:43:51.535 --> 01:43:53.123
It would inject more of the plague bacilli

1624
01:43:53.157 --> 01:43:56.713
into whatever victim it bit.

1625
01:43:56.747 --> 01:44:01.718
In San Francisco. the flea bite
would inject a lower dose.

1626
01:44:01.752 --> 01:44:05.342
harder for it to become
a full-blown disease.

1627
01:44:06.826 --> 01:44:12.004
So. it was only this quirk of flea anatomy

1628
01:44:12.038 --> 01:44:14.040
that really prevented millions
of deaths in the U.S.

1629
01:44:17.458 --> 01:44:21.600
February 1908 saw the last diagnosed case

1630
01:44:21.634 --> 01:44:24.050
of bubonic plague.

1631
01:44:24.085 --> 01:44:26.605
For the first time in nearly eight years.

1632
01:44:26.639 --> 01:44:29.573
San Francisco could afford to celebrate.

1633
01:44:29.608 --> 01:44:31.679
And on May 6. 1908.

1634
01:44:31.713 --> 01:44:35.510
the Great White Fleet
sailed into San Francisco Bay.

1635
01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.696
People stood atop
every hill and promontory

1636
01:44:48.730 --> 01:44:50.111
to get a look at these

1637
01:44:50.145 --> 01:44:52.665
magnificent golden and white ships

1638
01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:54.288
that were sent by Theodore Roosevelt.

1639
01:44:55.841 --> 01:45:01.502
People were waving flags
and partying all week.

1640
01:45:01.536 --> 01:45:03.089
It celebrated not only

1641
01:45:03.124 --> 01:45:05.747
the Great White Fleet
and naval power. but also

1642
01:45:05.782 --> 01:45:08.681
the rebirth of San Francisco
as a healthful city.

1643
01:45:08.716 --> 01:45:12.720
And it was an effort in which
everyone had taken part.

1644
01:45:16.862 --> 01:45:22.074
Chinatown was celebrating its own victory.

1645
01:45:24.041 --> 01:45:26.803
Its near-total destruction
during the earthquake

1646
01:45:26.837 --> 01:45:28.529
had lured white speculators

1647
01:45:28.563 --> 01:45:32.360
eager to snap up the valuable land.

1648
01:45:34.569 --> 01:45:37.365
But they hadn't counted on the
fierce opposition

1649
01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:40.092
of Chinese merchants and associations.

1650
01:45:40.126 --> 01:45:43.371
who fought them tooth and nail

1651
01:45:43.406 --> 01:45:46.581
to control how they wanted
the district to be used.

1652
01:45:50.413 --> 01:45:51.931
We later learn. of course.

1653
01:45:51.966 --> 01:45:55.970
they were quite successful in turning

1654
01:45:56.004 --> 01:45:58.766
the fear of Chinatown

1655
01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:02.390
as a labyrinth of disease and immorality

1656
01:46:02.425 --> 01:46:06.912
into a kind of middle-class.
consumer tourist paradise.

1657
01:46:13.505 --> 01:46:17.198
On March 31. 1909.

1658
01:46:17.232 --> 01:46:20.339
Rupert Blue was honored with
a lavish ceremony

1659
01:46:20.374 --> 01:46:23.756
at the Fairmont Hotel on Nob Hill.

1660
01:46:26.966 --> 01:46:29.313
The dinner was rat-themed.

1661
01:46:29.348 --> 01:46:32.627
They had ice cream molds
in the shape of rat traps.

1662
01:46:32.662 --> 01:46:36.320
They drank wine punch from beakers

1663
01:46:36.355 --> 01:46:38.806
that were shaped like little trash cans.

1664
01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.877
It was kind of visual puns everywhere.

1665
01:46:43.017 --> 01:46:46.330
It was a darkly
humorous nod to the rats killed.

1666
01:46:46.365 --> 01:46:49.920
two million in all.
roughly five times the size

1667
01:46:49.955 --> 01:46:51.646
of San Francisco's human population.

1668
01:46:54.269 --> 01:46:57.445
And when he was
called to the dais to accept his gift

1669
01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.895
and the city's thanks.

1670
01:46:58.929 --> 01:47:02.070
some of Blue's old shyness came
flooding back and he said.

1671
01:47:02.105 --> 01:47:06.523
"It's difficult to speak
when one's heart is full."

1672
01:47:06.558 --> 01:47:10.596
After all his achievements.
he got rather tongue-tied.

1673
01:47:13.081 --> 01:47:17.361
It was likely Blue's
reticence arose from not just humility.

1674
01:47:17.396 --> 01:47:21.331
but a clear-eyed view of the
debt he owed his predecessor.

1675
01:47:21.365 --> 01:47:24.921
True. he had been able to clean
up San Francisco

1676
01:47:24.955 --> 01:47:28.821
and rid the city of its rats.

1677
01:47:28.856 --> 01:47:30.927
But Kinyoun was the one who insisted

1678
01:47:30.961 --> 01:47:35.656
that the problem even existed.
and at enormous personal cost.

1679
01:47:38.037 --> 01:47:40.626
Blue was seen as a hero.

1680
01:47:40.661 --> 01:47:43.111
and he continued on an upward trajectory.

1681
01:47:43.146 --> 01:47:44.492
You know. he became

1682
01:47:44.527 --> 01:47:47.840
the fourth Surgeon General of
the United States.

1683
01:47:47.875 --> 01:47:50.671
He was a very forward thinker.

1684
01:47:50.705 --> 01:47:52.983
He was somebody who advocated

1685
01:47:53.018 --> 01:47:56.780
for better treatment of the mentally ill.

1686
01:47:56.815 --> 01:47:59.507
He advocated for a national
health insurance at a time

1687
01:47:59.542 --> 01:48:03.062
when that was never heard of whatsoever.

1688
01:48:03.097 --> 01:48:05.893
He saw where the world was going.

1689
01:48:09.621 --> 01:48:14.349
Dr. Joseph Kinyoun's
ouster from San Francisco represented

1690
01:48:14.384 --> 01:48:17.180
a kind of failure of institutional

1691
01:48:17.214 --> 01:48:19.838
resistance and rivalries.

1692
01:48:19.872 --> 01:48:23.807
But he is remembered for bringing

1693
01:48:23.842 --> 01:48:26.810
state of the art methods

1694
01:48:26.845 --> 01:48:31.746
of diagnosing infectious
diseases to America.

1695
01:48:31.781 --> 01:48:34.646
He is remembered for helping found

1696
01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:37.234
the National Hygienic Laboratory.

1697
01:48:37.269 --> 01:48:40.824
the forerunner of our modern
National Institutes of Health.

1698
01:48:40.859 --> 01:48:44.448
for which he is posthumously recognized

1699
01:48:44.483 --> 01:48:47.072
as the first director of NIH.

1700
01:48:50.938 --> 01:48:54.666
The two men brought an end to the epidemic

1701
01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:58.532
using vastly different approaches.

1702
01:48:58.566 --> 01:49:02.363
Yet. it was the efforts of not
just Kinyoun and Blue.

1703
01:49:02.397 --> 01:49:04.676
but the marginalized community

1704
01:49:04.710 --> 01:49:07.679
that still managed to stand up
for its rights.

1705
01:49:07.713 --> 01:49:09.784
that led to a paradigm shift

1706
01:49:09.819 --> 01:49:13.132
in the way America viewed public health.

1707
01:49:18.759 --> 01:49:23.142
One of the things
we learned in San Francisco

1708
01:49:23.177 --> 01:49:26.111
is that intervention into a
disease pandemic

1709
01:49:26.145 --> 01:49:28.009
is a profoundly political act.

1710
01:49:30.115 --> 01:49:34.291
Science is one dimension

1711
01:49:34.326 --> 01:49:39.365
to provide answers and to
provide solutions.

1712
01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:41.333
but it was still subject
to human interpretation.

1713
01:49:41.367 --> 01:49:42.748
human implementation.

1714
01:49:46.234 --> 01:49:49.134
The question that came up in 1900

1715
01:49:49.168 --> 01:49:52.793
is what is the balance between
public necessity.

1716
01:49:52.827 --> 01:49:54.726
public health. and individual
rights and liberties?

1717
01:49:56.693 --> 01:49:58.695
And it was balanced in a terrible way.

1718
01:50:02.388 --> 01:50:06.634
Power-seeking politicians.

1719
01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:10.086
and misguided commercial greed
that takes precedence

1720
01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:13.745
over public health. all of that

1721
01:50:13.779 --> 01:50:18.301
delayed a solution in San Francisco.

1722
01:50:18.335 --> 01:50:21.649
In the end. we needed
collaboration and cooperation

1723
01:50:21.684 --> 01:50:25.204
by the federal.
state. and local governments.

1724
01:50:25.239 --> 01:50:27.862
participation by the citizenry.

1725
01:50:27.897 --> 01:50:32.660
understanding and acceptance of science.

1726
01:50:35.905 --> 01:50:40.461
Science is
implicated with the larger society.

1727
01:50:40.495 --> 01:50:44.154
In San Francisco. we actually
pressed science to do work

1728
01:50:44.189 --> 01:50:46.674
that it has no business doing.

1729
01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:48.469
You don't need science to tell us

1730
01:50:48.503 --> 01:50:51.679
that we should treat people
with dignity and love.

1731
01:50:51.714 --> 01:50:54.268
Science is a method of inquiry.

1732
01:50:54.302 --> 01:50:58.790
It knows a lot.
but there's always unknowns.

1733
01:50:58.824 --> 01:51:03.311
We had some worldviews
that were coming into big conflict

1734
01:51:03.346 --> 01:51:06.245
about how to think about science.

1735
01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:10.664
about how to deal with
a public health crisis.

1736
01:51:10.698 --> 01:51:15.289
how to not ascribe
a racial cause for the disease.

1737
01:51:15.323 --> 01:51:17.705
and diverting accountability.

1738
01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:20.294
But also to think about.

1739
01:51:20.328 --> 01:51:24.436
is it possible to protect myself
from disease?

1740
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:27.094
Is it possible to eradicate disease?

1741
01:51:27.128 --> 01:51:30.614
And those are open questions.
