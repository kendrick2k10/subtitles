Well. you look beautiful.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.464
Thank you.

9
00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:16.636
What was that for?

10
00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.221
To remind you that
we're speaking at the conference

11
00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:19.848
in a few hours.

12
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:20.890
Wait. that's today?

13
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.892
What day did you think it was?

14
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.352
I don't know. tomorrow.

15
00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:26.563
Look. I'm pretty sure
you can handle it without me.

16
00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:27.730
I've got a lot of work to do.

17
00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:30.525
I need to figure out
which trail has the best chances

18
00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:32.110
of us finding something and
right now.

19
00:02:32.192 --> 00:02:32.944
- It's not like--
- Glen. suck it up

20
00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:35.321
and get ready.

21
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.948
If I do this one.
you have to promise

22
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.075
I won't have to ever again.

23
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.618
I promise.

24
00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:44.497
You know. I can always tell
when you're lying.

25
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:45.665
We leave in an hour.

26
00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:47.125
Okay.

27
00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:57.218
(♪♪♪)

28
00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:04.851
Excuse me.

29
00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:07.187
Could you all ple--
could you all sign my dinosaur.

30
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.228
- please?
- Yeah. sure.

31
00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.023
- Sure.
- Yeah.

32
00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:11.566
My son's a big fan.

33
00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.068
he watches
all your expedition videos.

34
00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:17.155
(Indistinct chatter)

35
00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:20.992
There you go.

36
00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:23.828
I'd like to find dinosaurs
and monsters with you when I--

37
00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.288
when I grow up.

38
00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:26.831
Hey. well. I look forward to
working with you.

39
00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:28.958
I think you're gonna make
a great monster hunter.

40
00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.543
- Thanks.
- Thank you. both.

41
00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:31.669
He's a little shy.

42
00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.504
but this means the world
to him.

43
00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:36.132
Well. thank you. guys.
for coming.

44
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.258
Thank you.

45
00:03:37.341 --> 00:03:40.094
(Indistinct chatter)

46
00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:40.762
Where is he?

47
00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.640
We do not have much time.

48
00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.642
Hey guys. sorry. I'm late.
Uh. which room is it in?

49
00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:46.643
GLEN:
It's in room 4.

50
00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.144
We'll be on in about 15 minutes.

51
00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.812
Oh. it'll only take me a second
to set up.

52
00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.859
Now. I hope you're all having
a wonderful time.

53
00:03:54.942 --> 00:03:56.694
Well. it's going to get
even better.

54
00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.113
I'm sure that most
if not all of you have heard

55
00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:02.492
of our next speakers.
Glen Craven and Lily Lantz.

56
00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:03.952
who are here to discuss with us

57
00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.870
the details
of their latest endeavor.

58
00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:09.332
So please give a big round
of applause to Glen and Lily.

59
00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:12.418
(Applause)

60
00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:18.548
Thank you all so much
for being with us today.

61
00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:20.260
Now. I'm sure
you all are wondering

62
00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:21.928
where our next
research expedition

63
00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:23.805
is going to be.

64
00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:28.351
Aliens. strange lights.
people completely vanishing.

65
00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:30.144
monsters.

66
00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:33.648
This. ladies and gentlemen.
is Mount Adams.

67
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.109
The mountain is most known
for its strange

68
00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:38.069
lights phenomenon.

69
00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:41.239
This is a still from a video
captured by a couple

70
00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:42.865
that went hiking
on the mountain.

71
00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.742
This man was driving
by the mountain

72
00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.452
when he saw that.

73
00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.998
This is a photo taken
by a farmer at dusk

74
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.292
about an hour
after he saw the lights

75
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.376
appear on the mountain.

76
00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.586
What's interesting
is people only report

77
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.921
seeing these creatures

78
00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.340
after the red lights
have been sighted.

79
00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.217
Now of course.
there are a lot of theories

80
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.595
which try to explain away
the lights and the creatures

81
00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.014
uh. which we will be covering
in our upcoming...

82
00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.849
...we've told you the stories
of eyewitnesses.

83
00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.726
we've showed you
the photographs.

84
00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:12.895
and now we are pretty much
out of time.

85
00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.732
but I think we can answer
at least one question.

86
00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.777
Uh. you in the front.

87
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:22.363
When do you plan to start
and how long do you expect

88
00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.656
to stay on the mountain?

89
00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:27.910
Yes. well. actually uh.
we'll be leaving tomorrow

90
00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.413
and uh. we'll be up there
for three days.

91
00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:33.457
Uh. we'll be bringing cameras.
camera traps.

92
00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:36.919
anything to help us uh.
capture some footage and some-

93
00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:40.631
some good evidence of uh.
whatever's up there.

94
00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:41.674
Uh. by the way a shout out

95
00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.927
to our awesome
camera tech guy Blake.

96
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:48.306
who will be joining us
along with a few other people.

97
00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.766
Hope that answers the question.

98
00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.018
I am so sorry.
but we are out of time.

99
00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:53.353
We'll be back at our booth
to answer

100
00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.021
any more of your questions.

101
00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:56.272
Thank you so much
for coming out

102
00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.107

103
00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.025

106
00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:11.204
(Indistinct chatter)

107
00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:12.372
Did you enjoy today?

108
00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.540
Oh. yeah. definitely.

109
00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:18.836
- Thank you. sir.
- Thank you.

110
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.547
Hey uh. my uncle practically
lives on Mount Adams.

111
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.549
He could be your guide
if you guys want one.

112
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:24.801
- That would be awesome.
- Yeah.

113
00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:26.761
Alright uh. my name is Louis.

114
00:06:26.844 --> 00:06:28.388
Here's his name and number.

115
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:29.806
Louis. thank you so much.

116
00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:30.932
Yep.

117
00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:31.933
Just tell him Louis sent you.

118
00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:33.101
- Thank you.

119
00:06:33.183 --> 00:06:33.893

120
00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:36.437
- Thanks. Louis.
- Hi. guys.

121
00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:37.855
I look-- I really look forward
to reading your book.

122
00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:38.981
Oh. thank you so much.

123
00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:48.699
(♪♪♪)

124
00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:50.659
You okay?

125
00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:52.995
No. I still can't find a trail
that's opened.

126
00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.122
they're all closed off.

127
00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:55.998
Look. you have no access here.
no access here.

128
00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.207
they-- they're all closed.

129
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.459
I think we're gonna be fine.

130
00:06:58.543 --> 00:06:59.919
Just give that guy a call.

131
00:07:03.047 --> 00:07:04.132
What guy?

132
00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.758
That guy's uncle that lives
next to the mountain.

133
00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.552
He said if we needed a guide.
that he'd help.

134
00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:12.765
Well. he's pretty much
our only shot at this point.

135
00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.768
so I'll just give him a call
tomorrow morning.

136
00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.061
Okay.

137
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:27.697
(♪♪♪)

138
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.075
But unless he actually
has access to the trails.

139
00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.284
there's no--

140
00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:33.411
(Grunting)

141
00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:34.579
No. I'm being serious.

142
00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:36.456
- We'll be fine.
- There's--

143
00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.082
Don't worry about it.

144
00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.041
(Chuckles)

145
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.586
Oh. what would I ever do
without you?

146
00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:43.713
(Sighing)

147
00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:45.673
You'd be sad and alone.

148
00:07:45.756 --> 00:07:47.550
(Chuckling)

149
00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:49.051
Goodnight.

150
00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.470
Goodnight.

151
00:07:50.553 --> 00:08:00.438
(♪♪♪)

152
00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:04.567
(Whirring)

153
00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:12.742
Oh. hey guys.

154
00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:13.618
So where's the little guy?

155
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:14.827
Is he comin'. too?

156
00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.330
Yep uh. we have to go
to his house to pick him up

157
00:08:17.413 --> 00:08:21.125
and by the way.
his sister's coming. too.

158
00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:22.043
- Okay.
- Oh. okay.

159
00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:23.085
You guys might wanna hurry
though.

160
00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.629
they're not gonna be happy
that we're late.

161
00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:29.884
Alright.
you guys got everything?

162
00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:30.843
Yep. we'll see you there.

163
00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:32.220
See you there.

164
00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:44.398
(♪♪♪)

165
00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:56.953
Hey. Thomas.

166
00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:58.579
About time you pisspots
showed up.

167
00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:00.581
Come on. it's cool
to be fashionably late!

168
00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.124
Fashionable. my ass.

169
00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.584
That's what you call it.

170
00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.469
Can you do anything by yourself?

171
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.054
I can. but I won't.

172
00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:25.147
(♪♪♪)

173
00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:36.033
(Grunting)

174
00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:37.618
Hey guys. uh.
whoever wants to shower

175
00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:38.953
should probably take one now.

176
00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:41.038
Nah. I'm good.
but it might be the last shower

177
00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:42.832
you ever take
before the aliens get you.

178
00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:44.875
- And why wouldn't they get you?
- Simple.

179
00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.752
Aliens would be like.
"Ew. what a smelly boy!".

180
00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.588
and then I'd just sit back.
and watch all you butt-clowns

181
00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:50.339
get snatched up into space.

182
00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.967
Um. I'll take my chances
with that. so...

183
00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:55.469
Hey. I'll take one with you.

184
00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.138
so we'll save water
for everybody.

185
00:09:57.221 --> 00:09:59.015
Okay. but you're not borrowing
my shampoos.

186
00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.891
Mm.

187
00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.311
Hey. anybody wanna take
a steamy hot shower with me?

188
00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:05.521
How about you.
Professor Peanut?

189
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:08.024
Not in a million years.

190
00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:09.942
Oh. well. it's your loss.

191
00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.736
Yes. it is.

192
00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.494

197
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:51.651

198
00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:55.988

(Indistinct speech)

210
00:11:32.733 --> 00:11:34.110
Yeah.

211
00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:44.203
(♪♪♪)

212
00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.249
(Knock on door)

213
00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:53.879
- Howdy folks.

214
00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.631

215
00:11:57.007 --> 00:11:58.217
Hi.

216
00:12:03.764 --> 00:12:04.807
Oh. here. here.

217
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.267
S-- sorry about the mess.

218
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.770
Uh. I don't get visitors here
too often.

219
00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.772
N-- now you can make yourselves
to home. but-

220
00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.899
but not too much. huh?

221
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.276
Hey. anybody want a drink?

222
00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:17.027
- Uh. I'm okay.
- No. no. I-- I'm good.

223
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:18.487
I'll have a beer!

224
00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:22.700

225
00:12:22.783 --> 00:12:25.035
8:00 a.m. in the morning. man
who likes beer.

226
00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:26.787
That's a man who knows
what's good for him.

227
00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:30.124
Hey. there's 24 beers in a case.
24 hours in a day.

228
00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:33.127
I don't think
that's a coincidence.

229
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:34.086
Oh.

230
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.921
Yeah. uh.

231
00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:36.964
Put that right there.
and we should be all set.

232
00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:39.008
Okay.

233
00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:41.635
Are we almost ready
for the interview?

234
00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:43.471
- Yeah. we're set to go.
- GLEN: Cool.

235
00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:45.347
Alright. we are here today
with Richard Croos

236
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.725
who lives next to the mountain
and he has some knowledge

237
00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:50.019
he'd like to share with us
regarding the mysterious

238
00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:52.813
alien phenomenon
surrounding Mount Adams.

239
00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.064
Richard. could you tell us
a little bit about

240
00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:55.399
your history here.

241
00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:57.693
Oh-ho. I've been here
all my life.

242
00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:00.029
My father actually bought
the farm a month

243
00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:02.072
before I was born.

244
00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:04.784
And what do you think about
all the UFO stories?

245
00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:08.245
Oh. there's lots of UFOs
and lights uh. around. they're--

246
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:09.789
they're not harmful.

247
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:11.332
It's-- it's what comes out
of the red

248
00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:13.501
that you have to worry about.

249
00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:18.047
Uh. the normal flying things
around the mountain are--

250
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.048
are-- are not a problem.

251
00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:20.466
My father taught me
that the only time

252
00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:24.345
you have to worry is
if the lights are red.

253
00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:26.055
then you gotta get the hell
out of there.

254
00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:29.350
Do-- do the red lights
like attack people or...

255
00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:32.269
No. it's what comes out
of the red lights.

256
00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:35.189
Um. monsters or aliens
or something.

257
00:13:35.272 --> 00:13:38.692
they come out and they hang
around for a couple of nights.

258
00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:45.991
Oh. it-- they steal livestock.
sometimes people. but it's uh--

259
00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:49.745
it's somethin' that
we have to keep an eye on.

260
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.331
Well. how often do people see
these red lights?

261
00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:55.084
Mm. depends on the time of year.

262
00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:56.710
Maybe once a year.

263
00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:59.088
That's once too often
for my mind.

264
00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:01.632
Uh. we-- we keep an eye on--
on it around here

265
00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:03.676
and call each other up
if anybody sees a red light

266
00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:05.511
up on that mountain.

267
00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:07.596
Uh. it's kinda like
a neighborhood watch--

268
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.432
- (Chuckles)
- But for aliens.

269
00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:12.810
So has anybody like tried
to predict

270
00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:14.436
when the lights will appear?

271
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.479
Oh. yeah.

272
00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.022
Yeah. I know somebody
who does that.

273
00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:18.983
Uh. he knows a lot more about it
than I do.

274
00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:20.442
anybody else for that matter.

275
00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.987
Oh. would-- would you be willing
to give us his contact info.

276
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:24.196
so we can talk to him?

277
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.281
Oh. of course.

278
00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:26.448
Uh. as a matter of fact
he's a neighbor mine.

279
00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.617
just lives a couple houses down.

280
00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.327
- That's great.
- Sure.

281
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:33.455
Uh-- uh.
is there any other questions?

282
00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:34.957
I think I've given you
all I want

283
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.960
for this docudramatary
or whatever it is.

284
00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:38.794
Uh. no. no.

285
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:39.753
You've-- you've been great.

286
00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:41.338
This has been a good interview.

287
00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:42.673
Sure thing.

288
00:14:42.756 --> 00:14:43.549

00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:50.222
Yeah.

Okay.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.477
Yeah well. thanks again so much
for letting us interview you.

293
00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:56.437
Oh. yeah.

294
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.439
No problem.

00:14:58.522 --> 00:14:59.690
Thank you again.

296
00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:01.942
Yes.

Hey.

300
00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:10.659
One piece of advice.

301
00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.786
Be careful.

302
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.830
I don't know if you believe
in all this.

303
00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.957
but it sure as hell is real.

304
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.794
Alright. I'll--
I'll remember that.

305
00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:30.888
(♪♪♪)

306
00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:35.601
So where to. boss?

307
00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:37.561
Let's go
to his neighbor's place.

308
00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:40.189
so let's see if he's home.
right down there.

309
00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:41.649
Alright. sounds like a plan.

310
00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:49.740
(♪♪♪)

311
00:16:01.418 --> 00:16:03.712
(Knock on door)

312
00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:10.761
- Hello.
- Hey.

313
00:16:10.844 --> 00:16:11.887
What can I do for you?

314
00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.639
We were sent here
by Richard Croos.

315
00:16:13.722 --> 00:16:15.140
Uh. he-- he said
you could help us find out

316
00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:17.017
when the lights on the mountain
will appear.

317
00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:18.018
Oh. yeah. sure. sure.

318
00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:19.103
- Come on in.
- Uh. thanks.

319
00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:20.813
Please.

320
00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:30.656
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

321
00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:32.700
You guys are gonna love this.

322
00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:38.205
Okay.

323
00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:44.086
Okay. okay.

324
00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:46.797
These are predictions
when the light appear next.

325
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.299
Um. what day is today?

326
00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:51.135
I believe it's the 2nd.

327
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.431
Look at here.

328
00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:56.932
Sometime around tomorrow night
will be

329
00:16:57.016 --> 00:17:01.478
when the red lights appear
again. so um. saying m--

330
00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:04.897
uh. like probably
maybe 50% chance.

331
00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:06.483
Sounds like
it's worth a shot to me.

332
00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:08.359
Yeah. say would you like
to join us?

333
00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:09.694
We'd love to have you on board.

334
00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:11.571
- Really?
- Yeah.

335
00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:13.031
That'd be great.

336
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:14.157
Do you know
where the ranger station

337
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:16.617
- is off of Highway 141?
- Well. yes.

338
00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.537
- Of course. yes. I do.
- Perfect.

339
00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:20.789
That's where we're meeting
our guide before we head on up.

340
00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.624
Just be there at 2:00
this afternoon.

341
00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.626
Hey guys. we got an interview
to do in 15 minutes.

342
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.627
- We gotta go to Debbie's house.
- Oh. right.

343
00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.630
Um. yeah. but we gotta run.

344
00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:33.969
but let's see.
here is my number.

345
00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.680
just in case you need
to call me.

346
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:38.057
Okay. will do.

347
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.808
- Thank you.
- Thanks again. Willie.

348
00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.685

350
00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:44.521
Alright.

351
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.627
- Okay. we're ready to go.
- Cool.

352
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.587
I guess I'll start off
by asking

353
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.173
what do you think is going on here at Mount Adams?

354
00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.509
Well. I'll tell you;
demonic activity.

355
00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:14.635
plain and simple.

356
00:18:14.718 --> 00:18:16.637
Care to explain
what you mean by that?

357
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.264
I don't expect you all
to understand completely.

358
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.475
but I do know somethin'
that'll help you understand

359
00:18:21.558 --> 00:18:22.768
a little bit more.

360
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:31.193
"And I beheld another beast
coming up out of the earth.

361
00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:33.278
and he had two horns
like a lamb.

362
00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:37.324
and he spake as a dragon.
and he exerciseth all the power

363
00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:41.036
of the first beast before him
and causes the earth and them.

364
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.664
which dwell therein
to worship the first beast.

365
00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:45.666
whose deadly wound was healed.

366
00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:46.959
And he doeth great wonders

367
00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:50.212
so that he maketh fire come down
from heaven on the earth

368
00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:51.672
in the sight of men."

369
00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:55.926
Now. do you understand
what I'm talking about?

370
00:18:56.009 --> 00:18:58.220
You mean the demons
are the monsters

371
00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:00.973
people see on the mountains
and the fire from heaven

372
00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:02.307
is supposed to be
the red lights?

373
00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:04.768
Yes. yes. you understand.

374
00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:06.895
Oh. and I've got another verse.

375
00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.690
Ephesians 6:12.

376
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.406
"For we wrestle not
against flesh and blood

377
00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:20.117
but against principalities.
against powers.

378
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.703
against the rulers
of the darkness of this world.

379
00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:26.331
against spiritual wickedness
in high places."

380
00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:28.834
Now. you can't tell me that
there's not a spiritual battle

381
00:19:28.917 --> 00:19:30.335
goin' on up there.

382
00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:34.715
Now. you said on the phone
that your daughter saw

383
00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:36.967
the creatures. too.

384
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.928
They were demons.

385
00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.305
We saw three of them out there.

386
00:19:41.388 --> 00:19:45.309
just off of our tree sightline
and-- and the sun had just set.

387
00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:46.977
and I know that
they were demons.

388
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.314
They had red glowing eyes
straight from hell.

389
00:19:50.397 --> 00:19:52.774
Is it alright if--
if we talk with her?

390
00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:53.901
DEBBIE:
With Ruby?

391
00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:56.528
Yes. she's outside taking care
of the animals.

392
00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:57.696
Come on.

393
00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:02.826
Hey guys. you must be
the demon hunter people.

394
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.453
- Mmhmm.
- I'm Blake.

395
00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:05.829
Hey. I'm Glen.

396
00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:07.289
Hey. Lily.

397
00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:09.917
So um. your mom told us
that you saw the creatures.

398
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.044
Like could you tell us exactly
what you saw?

399
00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:12.669
RUBY:
Yeah. sure.

400
00:20:12.753 --> 00:20:14.338
It was right out there.

401
00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:17.341
Uh. there were three of them.
running along the edge.

402
00:20:17.424 --> 00:20:18.926
These things were huge.
had red eyes.

403
00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:20.636
That's all I really remember.

404
00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:23.138
Ruby. is that the only time
you've seen the creatures?

405
00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:24.681
I wish it was. but no.

406
00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:26.266
They'd usually come around here

407
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.269
when the red lights
would go off on the mountain.

408
00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:31.396
When-- when was the last time
you saw them?

409
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.149
About a year ago
was the last time I saw them.

410
00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:35.400
I mean uh. they--
they must have done

411
00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:36.610
somethin' up on the mountain.

412
00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:39.029
'cause they were bringin'
trucks up there. bulldozers.

413
00:20:39.112 --> 00:20:40.489
they were haulin' everything
up there.

414
00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:41.698
I mean you still see
the red lights.

415
00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:44.660
but whatever they are.
don't come around here anymore.

416
00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:45.619
Oh. right.

417
00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:46.662
Yeah. uh. we--
we've gotta get back.

418
00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.330
I'm-- I'm sorry. but hey.
thank you so much

419
00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:49.456
- for letting us interview you.
- Oh.

420
00:20:49.539 --> 00:20:50.540
- Thank you. Ruby.
- Thanks.

421
00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:51.583
- No problem.
- Thank you. nice to meet you.

422
00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:52.459
And good luck in
whatever it is you're doin'.

423
00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:53.168
Nice to meet you.

424
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:54.419
Thanks.

425
00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:07.724
(Door opens)

426
00:21:07.808 --> 00:21:08.767
Oh. hey!

427
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:09.518
How'd it go?

428
00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:10.143
LILY:
Pretty well.

429
00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:11.103
- Good.
- Yeah.

430
00:21:11.186 --> 00:21:12.271
I thought it went good.

431
00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:13.272
Hey. I got a free beer.

432
00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:14.356
Everything good here?

433
00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:16.358
Yeah. Kim and Thomas should be
ready to go--

434
00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:17.943
(Kim screaming)

435
00:21:18.026 --> 00:21:23.448
(♪♪♪)

436
00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:24.283
Are you guys alright?

437
00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:25.325
(Screaming)

438
00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:27.286
Oh. uh--

439
00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:28.412
Welcome back.

440
00:21:28.495 --> 00:21:29.663
Surprise.

441
00:21:29.746 --> 00:21:30.622
Come on. really you guys?

442
00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:31.832
You should know better.

443
00:21:31.915 --> 00:21:33.041
Uh. surprise.

444
00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.459
Surprise what?

445
00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:35.752
That over there.

446
00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:38.839
- (Gasping)
- (Chuckling)

447
00:21:42.384 --> 00:21:44.177
You can't stay mad at me
forever.

448
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:46.054
Yeah. Lily. forgiveness
is the key to moving on

449
00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:47.055
with your life.

450
00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:47.973
How true.

451
00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:49.433
We forgave you for being
a piece of--

452
00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:51.518
Okay. you guys are really
getting on my nerves.

453
00:21:51.601 --> 00:21:53.228
Uh-oh. somebody has nerves.

454
00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:54.771
Oh. the nerve of some people.

455
00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:55.897
Seriously. you guys?

456
00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:57.482
(Laughing)

457
00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:58.734
Hey. we're here.

458
00:21:58.817 --> 00:21:59.901
I noticed.

459
00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:03.113
(Birds chirping)

460
00:22:03.196 --> 00:22:06.199
(Vehicle whirring)

461
00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:27.804
Hi. I'm uh.
Chief Ranger Bill Jefferson.

462
00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:29.181
- Glen. right?
- Yep.

463
00:22:29.264 --> 00:22:31.016
We spoke to each other
on the phone?

464
00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:32.434
- Yeah. that's me.
- Lily.

465
00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:33.518
(Chuckles)

466
00:22:33.602 --> 00:22:36.521
This is uh. it's Blake.
camera guy and tech.

467
00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:38.565
- And uh. that's Candie.
- Hi.

468
00:22:38.648 --> 00:22:41.777
And uh. Thomas and Kim.
they're the assistants.

469
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.278
Well. pleased to meet you all.

470
00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:44.821
(Sighing)

471
00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:48.241
So um. how about we get up
on that mountain?

472
00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:49.076
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

473
00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:50.660
we'll follow you on
up there.

474
00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:51.995
Sounds good.

475
00:22:52.079 --> 00:23:02.089
(♪♪♪)

476
00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:42.129
(♪♪♪)

477
00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:17.247
(Grunts)

478
00:24:27.716 --> 00:24:30.427
So uh. you know.
this is the uh closed-off trail

479
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.095
that leads up around
the mountain

480
00:24:32.179 --> 00:24:33.555
eventually to the top.

481
00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:36.558
Believe this is the trail
you mentioned on the phone.

482
00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:38.268
Well. how are we supposed
to get up there

483
00:24:38.351 --> 00:24:39.269
if it's blocked off?

484
00:24:39.352 --> 00:24:40.604
You won't.

485
00:24:40.687 --> 00:24:41.813
Nobody's allowed up there.

486
00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:43.815
Uh. too many people
went missin'.

487
00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:46.359
so four years ago
we decided to start closin'

488
00:24:46.443 --> 00:24:49.070
all the trails
that lead to the top.

489
00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:50.989
Are there any trails
that are still open?

490
00:24:51.072 --> 00:24:53.116
Only the ones around the base
of the mountain.

491
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.868
(Sighing)

492
00:24:55.827 --> 00:24:57.579
I'll be right back.

493
00:24:57.662 --> 00:24:59.789
I thought you talked to him
about this.

494
00:24:59.873 --> 00:25:00.957
I did talk to the guy
about this.

495
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:02.209
(Sighing)

496
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:08.715
I can't believe
we came all the way out here

497
00:25:08.798 --> 00:25:10.300
- for this.
- It's okay.

498
00:25:10.383 --> 00:25:12.135
How much money do we have?

499
00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:15.764
You're not thinking about
bribing a forest ranger?

500
00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:16.431
Trust me.

501
00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:17.807
How much do we have?

502
00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:22.020
Um. I think about 500.

503
00:25:23.897 --> 00:25:24.940
Yeah. 500.

504
00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:26.900
I can't believe you brought
that much money.

505
00:25:26.983 --> 00:25:29.903
Well. I wanted to be prepared
in case we had an emergency.

506
00:25:29.986 --> 00:25:32.322
Well. this counts
as an emergency.

507
00:25:32.405 --> 00:25:33.281
Yeah. I suppose.

508
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:34.950
(Sighing)

509
00:25:37.577 --> 00:25:38.703
This is the part
where she flashes him

510
00:25:38.787 --> 00:25:40.330
and he lets us go up there.

511
00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:41.665
(Scoffs)

512
00:25:46.086 --> 00:25:49.798
Hey. if you're willing to be
our guide on the trail.

513
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:52.842
I'll give you $300 cash
right now.

514
00:25:54.135 --> 00:25:58.265
Um. look. if you--
you wanna pay for a tour guide

515
00:25:58.348 --> 00:26:00.725
to take you up there.
I can do that.

516
00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:02.686
but it'll cost you.

517
00:26:02.769 --> 00:26:03.770
400.

518
00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:07.524
Works for me.

519
00:26:07.607 --> 00:26:16.616
(♪♪♪)

520
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.285
Works for me.

521
00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:20.287
I'll go grab my stuff
and we'll get goin'.

522
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.289
Cool. Give us five minutes
to get ready.

523
00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:32.382
(♪♪♪)

524
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.720
No. it's not safe.

525
00:26:36.803 --> 00:26:38.471
Look. you don't have to go.

526
00:26:38.555 --> 00:26:40.098
Nobody's forcin' you.

527
00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:45.061
Everything alright?

528
00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:51.693
Look. I'm sorry. I can't go.

529
00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:55.071
I thought we just stayin'
on the side of the road.

530
00:26:55.155 --> 00:26:56.781
It's not a smart idea to be
up there

531
00:26:56.865 --> 00:26:59.159
if the light do come tonight.

532
00:26:59.242 --> 00:27:00.827
Well. but we--
we have to go up there.

533
00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.203
there's no clear shots
down here.

534
00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:04.497
We have to--
we have to film the lights.

535
00:27:04.581 --> 00:27:06.249
I know.

536
00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:07.626
I know but--

537
00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:10.920
Here. give me a radio.

538
00:27:11.004 --> 00:27:13.423
so I can stay in contact
with you.

539
00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:14.633
Here.

540
00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:17.052
Well. we'll give you a call
if anything goes wrong.

541
00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:19.721
Okay.

542
00:27:23.433 --> 00:27:24.851
Stay safe. okay?

543
00:27:24.934 --> 00:27:26.436
I will.

544
00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:28.563
Hey Bill. give me your keys.

545
00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:30.565
I'll drive the truck back
to the station.

546
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:32.651
I'll come pick you up
when you're ready.

547
00:27:32.734 --> 00:27:34.069
Alright.

548
00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:35.528
(Grunts)

549
00:27:35.612 --> 00:27:45.622
(♪♪♪)

550
00:28:21.825 --> 00:28:23.827
I'm afraid
I'm gonna want my money back.

551
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:24.911
Oh. no. no--

552
00:28:24.994 --> 00:28:25.829
Everything's fine.

553
00:28:25.912 --> 00:28:29.165
We just need to take a shortcut.

554
00:28:29.249 --> 00:28:30.458
Did he say "shortcut"?

555
00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:32.919
Are you absolutely sure
you know what you're doing?

556
00:28:33.002 --> 00:28:35.255
I mean have you ever even been
on this path?

557
00:28:35.338 --> 00:28:37.090
No. not exactly.

558
00:28:37.173 --> 00:28:40.135
I'm familiar with the map.
I do know where we're going.

559
00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:43.138
We'll just go on
through up here

560
00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:46.599
and uh.
it'll take us to the top.

561
00:28:46.683 --> 00:28:47.976
I promise.

562
00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:49.227
You better be right.

563
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:59.404
(♪♪♪)

564
00:28:59.487 --> 00:29:00.530
A word?

565
00:29:04.033 --> 00:29:05.118
What's up?

566
00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:07.620
Look. I-- I don't think
it's a good idea to--

567
00:29:07.704 --> 00:29:10.373
Blake. it's not gonna kill us
to go off the trail. okay?

568
00:29:10.457 --> 00:29:11.499
It's fine.
As long as Bill knows

569
00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:13.585
what he's doing. it'll be okay.

570
00:29:13.668 --> 00:29:14.419
THOMAS:
Seriously?

571
00:29:14.502 --> 00:29:15.712
I could eat a bowl
of alphabet soup

572
00:29:15.795 --> 00:29:17.714
and crap out a statement
smarter than that.

573
00:29:17.797 --> 00:29:20.300
Look. all Ranger Turd-face
is gonna do is get us lost.

574
00:29:20.383 --> 00:29:22.302
so he can get the $400
for a blow-up doll.

575
00:29:22.385 --> 00:29:26.264
Look. I know what I'm doin'.
alright?

576
00:29:26.347 --> 00:29:27.557
I've been
a chief forest ranger

577
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.558
for 10 years.

578
00:29:28.641 --> 00:29:29.768
So why don't you just shut
the hell up

579
00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:31.936
- and let me do my job?
- Keep talkin'.

580
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.231
Maybe someday you'll say
something intelligent.

581
00:29:35.315 --> 00:29:37.108
Hey guys. uh.
we're losing daylight.

582
00:29:37.192 --> 00:29:37.734
we need to move.

583
00:29:37.817 --> 00:29:39.194
Whatever.

584
00:29:59.047 --> 00:30:00.131
(Taking deep breaths)

585
00:30:00.215 --> 00:30:01.090
I'm sorry. I um--

586
00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:02.050
(Takes a deep breath)

587
00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:03.802
Just need to take a quick rest.

588
00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:05.094
Oh. I'll tell them to wait up.

589
00:30:05.178 --> 00:30:06.429
Oh. no. that's okay.

590
00:30:06.513 --> 00:30:10.058
Um. yeah. I can still see 'em.
so we can catch up.

591
00:30:11.184 --> 00:30:14.020
(Taking deep breaths)

592
00:30:14.103 --> 00:30:16.022
Are we really going all the way
to the top?

593
00:30:16.105 --> 00:30:17.273
Well. yes.

594
00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:19.067
Isn't this the romantic getaway
in the heart of nature

595
00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.193
that you always wanted?

596
00:30:20.276 --> 00:30:21.736
CANDIE:
Not exactly.

597
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.071
Though. everywhere with you
always turns

598
00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:25.031
into a romantic getaway. so...

599
00:30:25.114 --> 00:30:26.533
(Laughing)

600
00:30:28.201 --> 00:30:29.994
I'll make it even more romantic
when we get to the top.

601
00:30:30.078 --> 00:30:31.287
Oh. I'm sure you will.

602
00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:32.080
(Chuckling)

603
00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:33.581
Here. hand me my backpack.

604
00:30:38.419 --> 00:30:40.171
Okay. let's--
let's get out of here.

605
00:30:40.255 --> 00:30:50.265
(♪♪♪)

606
00:30:57.522 --> 00:30:58.064
(Exclaims)

607
00:30:58.147 --> 00:30:59.315
Blake.

608
00:31:04.487 --> 00:31:06.281
(Yelling)

609
00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:07.115
Really?

610
00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:08.366
You guys.

611
00:31:08.449 --> 00:31:09.826
Glen told us to come back
and check on you.

612
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:11.244
We're all waiting for you.

613
00:31:11.327 --> 00:31:12.537
Looks like
they're alright to me.

614
00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.496
Mission accomplished.

615
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.290
- (Chuckling)
- Yep.

616
00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:16.708
I'm gonna kill you guys.

617
00:31:16.791 --> 00:31:17.959
Good luck with that.

618
00:31:18.042 --> 00:31:28.052
(♪♪♪)

619
00:31:30.138 --> 00:31:31.306
So how much further?

620
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:32.891
Well. not much.

621
00:31:32.974 --> 00:31:35.685
I suggest we uh.
set up camp here.

622
00:31:35.768 --> 00:31:37.562
It's not much farther up
to the top.

623
00:31:37.645 --> 00:31:39.981
Okay. that sounds great to me.

624
00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:42.734
Blake. can you set up camp.
so uh. Glen and I can set up

625
00:31:42.817 --> 00:31:44.402
some cameras on the trees
around here?

626
00:31:44.485 --> 00:31:45.486
Yeah. no problem.

627
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.822
Hey. Thomas. Kim.
could you help him out?

628
00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:48.823
- KIM: Yeah. sure.
- THOMAS: Sure.

629
00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:50.033
Thanks.

630
00:31:54.704 --> 00:31:55.788
Hey. how about right here?

631
00:31:55.872 --> 00:31:57.874
That way we can see
if anything comes close to camp.

632
00:31:57.957 --> 00:31:59.375
Oh. yeah. that'll work.

633
00:32:12.805 --> 00:32:13.556
There we go.

634
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.433
Okay.

635
00:32:17.393 --> 00:32:19.395
(Taking deep breaths)

636
00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:27.403
You know. the lights
are probably just airplanes.

637
00:32:27.487 --> 00:32:29.197
Stop being such a pessimist.

638
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.156
No. I'm being serious.

639
00:32:30.239 --> 00:32:34.243
Like I mean
do you honestly think that

640
00:32:34.327 --> 00:32:36.454
there's demons and aliens
up here?

641
00:32:36.537 --> 00:32:39.958
I mean not really. but I think
anything's possible.

642
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:42.210
Well. I don't know.

643
00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:44.462
I think some things
are more possible than others.

644
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:56.516
Okay. I got just one left.

645
00:32:56.599 --> 00:32:57.725
Oh. yes.

646
00:32:57.809 --> 00:32:58.476
Uh.

647
00:32:58.559 --> 00:32:59.394
Where do you want this one?

648
00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:00.311
Down that way.

649
00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:02.188
Alright. cool.

650
00:33:06.526 --> 00:33:07.860

651
00:33:07.944 --> 00:33:17.954

652
00:33:32.427 --> 00:33:34.887
No. no. you're shitting it
all up!

653
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:36.848
Why don't you watch
your language. you little turd.

654
00:33:36.931 --> 00:33:38.683
Let me tell you about
a porcupine's balls.

655
00:33:38.766 --> 00:33:40.518
They're small
and they don't give a crap.

656
00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:41.769
Why don't you grow up?

657
00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:43.604
Hey. hey. hey. hey.
come on now. guys!

658
00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:47.567
Blake. do you have
all the camera stuff?

659
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.402
We need to head up
before it gets too dark.

660
00:33:49.485 --> 00:33:50.862
Yeah. I'm all ready to go.

661
00:33:50.945 --> 00:33:51.863
Candie. do you have your shoes?

662
00:33:51.946 --> 00:33:53.114
Uh. they're right here.
I'll put 'em on.

663
00:33:53.197 --> 00:33:54.198
BLAKE:
Alright.

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:57.410
Hey. Bill. you comin'?

665
00:33:57.493 --> 00:33:58.786
No. I'm good.

666
00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.872
You let me know
if you see anything. huh?

667
00:34:00.955 --> 00:34:02.457
Will do.

668
00:34:10.922 --> 00:34:13.551
Onward to battle
with the aliens!

669
00:34:13.634 --> 00:34:23.643
(♪♪♪)

670
00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:10.024
I'll now name this giant piece
of dirt "Titty Top Mountain".

(♪♪♪)

672
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.082
I'll set the camera up.

673
00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:31.254
Hey. look down there.

674
00:35:37.009 --> 00:35:39.345
Oh my God. are you filming?

675
00:35:39.428 --> 00:35:40.972
Yeah. I'm getting this.

676

677

(Indistinct chatter)

678
00:36:06.581 --> 00:36:08.207
I can't believe it's on camera.

679
00:36:08.291 --> 00:36:09.917
I know.

680
00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:12.003
Oh my God. that footage
is gonna be amazing.

681
00:36:12.086 --> 00:36:13.004
I cannot wait to see it.

682
00:36:13.087 --> 00:36:14.505
We're gonna sell a lot of DVDs.

683
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:16.215
I know. I'm so excited.

684

(Taking deep breaths)

687
00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:27.435
This is Bill's.

688

Hey. Bill?

691
00:36:35.568 --> 00:36:37.695
Why would he go walking
in the mud?

692

- (Gasping)
- KIM: Oh my God!

693
00:36:42.158 --> 00:36:43.743
That's blood.

694

I'm calling 911.

I mean we--

Can you hear me?

712
00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:23.991
We-- we can't find Bill.

713
00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:25.493

Well. you guys are the adults.

00:37:38.005 --> 00:37:39.799
Good luck and good night.

719
00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:41.467
Honestly. that's not a bad idea.

720
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.928
We're not gonna find him
at this time of night. anyway.

721
00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:45.429
Yeah. I agree.

722
00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:47.515
Yeah. sounds good.

723
00:37:47.598 --> 00:37:48.516
Alright.

724
00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:49.850
Fine. we'll-- we'll--
we'll look for him

725
00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:51.269

726
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.146
(Sighing)

727
00:37:55.356 --> 00:37:59.819

728
00:37:59.902 --> 00:38:09.912

729
00:38:16.752 --> 00:38:18.546
There you go.

730
00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:26.012
So how much longer
do we have to uh. look for Bill?

731
00:38:26.095 --> 00:38:27.305
I'm not sure.

732
00:38:27.388 --> 00:38:28.806
We'll never find him.
'cause he's probably out stealing

733
00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:30.224
our cars I bet.

734
00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:31.851
Thomas. that's not funny.

735
00:38:31.934 --> 00:38:33.519
He's probably really hurt.

736
00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:40.026
I'm gonna go look for him.

737
00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:41.402
You wanna come?

738
00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:42.653
Yeah. sure.

GLEN:
Hey. Bill!

00:39:02.214 --> 00:39:04.675
Hey. Bill!

741
00:39:04.759 --> 00:39:06.469
Bill!

742
00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:16.729
You know. we're dead
if we don't find him.

743
00:39:16.812 --> 00:39:18.272
Well. thanks for being positive.

744
00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:19.273
No. seriously.

745
00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:20.566
He's the only one
who knows his way back

746
00:39:20.649 --> 00:39:21.817
to the trail.

747
00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:23.361
Oh. I'm--
I'm sure we'll be fine.

748
00:39:23.444 --> 00:39:25.029
we'll find him.

749
00:39:25.112 --> 00:39:26.781
Oh. hold up.
I gotta water the trees.

750
00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:28.032
Alright.

751
00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:35.706
(Flies buzzing)

752
00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.547
Oh!

753
00:39:43.631 --> 00:39:44.173
Glen!

754
00:39:44.256 --> 00:39:45.341
Glen. come over here!

755
00:39:45.424 --> 00:39:46.717
I think I found something.
you need to see this!

756
00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:53.974
He's dead.

757
00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:55.518
Yeah. that-- that's him.

758
00:39:55.601 --> 00:39:56.936
We-- we gotta tell 'em.

759
00:39:57.019 --> 00:39:58.104
We gotta tell 'em.

760
00:39:58.187 --> 00:39:59.897
No. no. wait. wait!
Thomas. wait!

761
00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:10.199

762
00:40:10.282 --> 00:40:11.200
He's dead!

763
00:40:11.283 --> 00:40:12.118
He's dead!

764
00:40:12.201 --> 00:40:14.161
- What?
- What?

765
00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:16.664
(Taking deep breaths)

766
00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:18.958
We found him.

767
00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:20.793
It looked like an animal attack
to me.

768
00:40:23.546 --> 00:40:26.090
Oh my gosh.

769
00:40:26.173 --> 00:40:29.635
So what-- what do we do now?

770
00:40:29.718 --> 00:40:32.263
I think we should pack up
and head back down.

771
00:40:32.346 --> 00:40:34.473
But Bill was the only one
who knew how to get back.

772
00:40:34.557 --> 00:40:36.058
We don't have a choice Kim.
okay?

773
00:40:36.142 --> 00:40:40.229
This is a closed-off zone.
nobody comes up here.

774
00:40:40.312 --> 00:40:41.439
She's-- she's right.

775
00:40:41.522 --> 00:40:42.773
If we're gonna try today
we need to leave

776
00:40:42.857 --> 00:40:44.316
as soon as we can.

777
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.484
Okay.

778
00:40:45.568 --> 00:40:55.578

779
00:41:13.929 --> 00:41:15.389
Are you okay?
We can take a break.

00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:17.141
I'm fine. sort of.

781
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.483

782
00:41:27.234 --> 00:41:28.819
Ow!

783
00:41:28.903 --> 00:41:29.778
What the hell was that?

784
00:41:29.862 --> 00:41:32.156
It looked like a bug!

785
00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:33.073
Wait. did you get stung?

786
00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:34.575
Sure feels like I did.

788
00:41:45.586 --> 00:41:47.421

00:41:53.427 --> 00:41:54.345
Blake. be careful

790
00:41:54.428 --> 00:41:55.804
I don't know
if we brought your EpiPen.

791
00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:02.520
Oh dang. that thing's nasty!

Oh. mm.

Get me a stick.
I wanna make sure

796
00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:10.653
it doesn't hurt anybody.

797
00:42:10.736 --> 00:42:13.239
Thomas lines up his bat
and focuses on the target.

798
00:42:13.322 --> 00:42:15.908
Look at that concentration
as he's getting ready.

799
00:42:15.991 --> 00:42:17.326
And he scores!

800
00:42:17.409 --> 00:42:19.620
Oh. that was disgusting.

801
00:42:24.833 --> 00:42:26.460
Everything going okay?

802
00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:28.963
Yeah. as far as I can tell.

803
00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:30.381
Does it feel any better?

804
00:42:30.464 --> 00:42:31.840
Uh. yeah. sort of.

805
00:42:31.924 --> 00:42:34.093
- You think you can walk?
- I can.

806
00:42:34.176 --> 00:42:36.554
It doesn't hurt that bad.
it just really stings.

807
00:42:36.637 --> 00:42:37.513
Okay.

808
00:42:37.596 --> 00:42:39.515

00:43:27.563 --> 00:43:29.064
We've been walking all day.

813
00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:31.859
I don't know.

814
00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:32.901
What do you mean you don't know?

815
00:43:32.985 --> 00:43:35.029
It means I don't know.

816
00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:38.115
- Candie. we're lost.
- Don't-- don't say we're lost.

817

(♪♪♪)

818
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.838
We should probably find a place
to set up camp.

819
00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:54.131
I know.

820
00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:05.684
You know. we've still got
plenty of food. we've got water.

821
00:44:05.768 --> 00:44:10.773
we've got tents. sleeping bags.
I mean we'll be alright.

822
00:44:10.856 --> 00:44:11.857
Alright.

823
00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:16.320
I'll get a fire going.
that'll make you feel better.

825
00:44:45.891 --> 00:44:47.434
So since we're on the topic
of farms.

826
00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:49.186
I kinda had a question.

827
00:44:49.269 --> 00:44:51.730
If a cow laughed like really.
really hard

828
00:44:51.814 --> 00:44:53.148
would milk come out
of its nose?

829
00:44:53.232 --> 00:44:54.608
(Chuckling)

830
00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:55.442
What?

831
00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:56.902
I thought it made sense.

832
00:44:56.985 --> 00:44:59.071
Hey. I lived on a farm
and I can tell you

833
00:44:59.154 --> 00:45:00.155
that would never happen.

834
00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:01.365
(Chuckling)

835
00:45:01.448 --> 00:45:03.325
I visited a farm
for a school trip once

836
00:45:03.409 --> 00:45:04.910
and the teacher asked
the farmer.

837
00:45:04.993 --> 00:45:06.954
"So what's your favorite part
about bein' a farmer?"

838
00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:09.748
He says. "Gettin' down dirty
with all my hoes."

839
00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:11.125
CANDIE:
Oh my God.

840
00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:12.626

841
00:45:16.463 --> 00:45:19.049
Well. I think I'm ready
to hit the hay.

842
00:45:19.133 --> 00:45:19.967
No pun intended.

843
00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.261

844
00:45:22.344 --> 00:45:23.595

Oh. how's your leg doin'?

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:27.516
It's okay.

848
00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:29.226
Thanks for asking.

849
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:31.437
Don't worry.
I killed that little sucker.

850
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.355
Uh. believe me
it wasn't little.

851

Okay.

894
00:50:50.964 --> 00:50:52.007
Yeah. that's--
that's really bad.

895
00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:56.470
Um. Lily. can you find me
a knife and a lighter?

896
00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:57.220
Yeah.

897
00:50:57.304 --> 00:50:58.305
No. I'm not gonna let you--

898
00:50:58.388 --> 00:50:59.639
No. no. no.
I'm not gonna cut off your leg.

899
00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:01.850
but there's a lot of pus
built up in there

900
00:51:01.933 --> 00:51:03.643
and we need to get it out.

901
00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:05.520
It'll hurt at first.
but I promise

902
00:51:05.604 --> 00:51:09.357
it'll feel a lot better
when it's done.

903
00:51:09.441 --> 00:51:10.692
Okay.

904
00:51:10.776 --> 00:51:13.653
As long as you don't cut off
my leg I'm fine.

905
00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:16.615
Is-- is this the only knife
we have?

906
00:51:16.698 --> 00:51:19.910
It's the only one I could find.

907
00:51:19.993 --> 00:51:21.036
Okay.

908
00:51:22.496 --> 00:51:23.997
(Sighing)

909
00:51:36.218 --> 00:51:38.261
You might wanna close your eyes
for this.

910
00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:47.813
(Kim grunting)

911
00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:50.690
Okay.

912
00:51:56.863 --> 00:51:59.783
(Grunting)

913
00:51:59.866 --> 00:52:01.993
GLEN:
Alright.

914
00:52:02.077 --> 00:52:07.749
Um. worst part is over.

915
00:52:07.833 --> 00:52:10.085
Wasn't that bad.

916
00:52:10.168 --> 00:52:12.254
That was like a giant zit
on your leg.

917
00:52:12.337 --> 00:52:13.713
Shut up. that's gross.

918
00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:15.966
Well. it is gross.

919
00:52:16.049 --> 00:52:17.926
I don't think I can carry
my backpack.

920
00:52:18.009 --> 00:52:19.553
I'll-- I'll take it.

921
00:52:20.554 --> 00:52:23.807
Are you sure you can carry
two backpacks?

922
00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:27.811
Well. in that case.
I guess you'll take it then.

923
00:52:27.894 --> 00:52:31.606
Well. I guess I will.

924
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:32.566
Let me know
if it gets too heavy

925
00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:34.276
and I'll take it for you.

926
00:52:34.359 --> 00:52:36.570
I'll definitely take you up
on that offer.

927

(♪♪♪)

928
00:53:01.136 --> 00:53:04.264
I think we should stay here
tonight.

929
00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:05.807
Yeah. I mean this place
will work

930
00:53:05.891 --> 00:53:08.310
and at least we have
some protection behind us.

931
00:53:08.393 --> 00:53:09.311
LILY:
Exactly.

932
00:53:09.394 --> 00:53:15.567
(♪♪♪)

933
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:17.319
Hey. can you help me
collect firewood?

934
00:53:17.402 --> 00:53:19.029
Oh. yeah. yeah. good idea.

935
00:53:19.112 --> 00:53:29.122
(♪♪♪)

936
00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:58.151
So how many more nights
are we gonna stay out here?

937
00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:01.446
This is the last night I hope.

938
00:54:01.529 --> 00:54:04.658
If not. how long
can we survive?

939
00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:09.204
Well. we're pretty much
out of food.

940
00:54:09.287 --> 00:54:12.666
Yeah. we have about
a day's worth of water.

941
00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:14.042
So basically. we're all--

942
00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:15.168
(Shushing)

943
00:54:15.252 --> 00:54:17.087
You need to stay positive.

944
00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:18.296
THOMAS:
Oh. okay.

945
00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:22.884
So instead of the glass being
99% empty. it's 1% full.

946
00:54:22.968 --> 00:54:24.761
Well. that's the spirit.

947
00:54:28.306 --> 00:54:30.809
Hey. I'm gonna keep watch
for a while

948
00:54:30.892 --> 00:54:32.727
if you wanna get some sleep.

949
00:54:32.811 --> 00:54:34.604
Okay. wake me when it's my turn.

950
00:54:34.688 --> 00:54:35.563
Alright.

951
00:54:35.647 --> 00:54:36.815
Hmm.

What the hell?

957
00:56:21.419 --> 00:56:23.088
What was that?

(Grunting)

959
00:56:24.297 --> 00:56:26.549
I-- I speared it.

00:56:26.633 --> 00:56:27.258
You what?

961
00:56:27.342 --> 00:56:28.343
(Taking deep breaths)

962
00:56:28.426 --> 00:56:29.260
I don't-- I don't think
they're coming back.

963
00:56:29.344 --> 00:56:30.470
Well. how many were there?

964
00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:32.680
GLEN:
I think there was about three.

965
00:56:32.764 --> 00:56:34.849
I can't sleep now.

966
00:56:34.933 --> 00:56:36.851
Well. how long till morning?

967
00:56:36.935 --> 00:56:42.399
Um. it's-- it's 5:45 right now.

968
00:56:42.482 --> 00:56:46.569
So not too much longer
till sunrise.

969
00:56:46.653 --> 00:56:48.071
Well. that's good news.

970
00:56:48.154 --> 00:56:49.864
The only good news I want was.

971
00:56:49.948 --> 00:56:52.242
"Oh. hey.
this was just a bad dream."

Oh my God. I can't move my leg.

What do you mean?

984
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:34.487
I can't feel my leg.

Alright. I'm gonna take--
I'm gonna take your boot off.

Okay.

989
01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:09.939
Can you feel that?

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.108
No. I can't feel anything.

992
01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:21.826
This is bad.

01:00:23.244 --> 01:00:24.621
Uh-- uh. can we build
a stretcher for her

994
01:00:24.704 --> 01:00:25.788
or something?

995
01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:28.875
No. that'll take too long.

Uh. I'll just--
I'll just carry her.

really uncomfortable.

but just let me know

1001
01:01:06.954 --> 01:01:09.582
if anything really
starts hurting.

You guys. she has a fever.

1016
01:02:51.517 --> 01:02:53.978
Here. you need to drink that.

1017
01:02:59.066 --> 01:03:01.569
Is she gonna be okay?

1018
01:03:01.652 --> 01:03:04.989
Well. we really need to get her
to a hospital.

1019
01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:06.657
Okay. well. then we need
to move quickly.

a campsite.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:00.628
I know.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:17.019
I still can't believe
this is happening. you know?

1033
01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:22.066
This was just supposed
to be a simple documentary

1034
01:04:22.149 --> 01:04:25.152
about all the nonsense
that people believe

1035
01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:26.904
about this mountain.

1036
01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:30.366
But no. no.
it just so happens that

1037
01:04:30.449 --> 01:04:35.037
there are real monsters
and aliens out to kill us.

1038
01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:38.249
Oh. and not to mention.
we're also completely lost

1039
01:04:38.332 --> 01:04:41.794
in the wonderful world
of unprocessed paper.

1041
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.757
Do you or Lily have
any sort of plan

1042
01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:50.177
that doesn't involve
the afterlife?

1043
01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:55.099
GLEN:
Uh. Lily's smart.

1044
01:04:55.182 --> 01:04:57.935
I'm-- I'm sure
she's figuring out something.

1045
01:05:00.771 --> 01:05:04.942
We've been in some really
bad situations before.

1046
01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:06.944
She always figures
somethin' out.

1047
01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:09.155
always comes up
with some kind of idea.

1048
01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:13.951
Never-- never this bad though.

1049
01:05:16.787 --> 01:05:20.666
If-- if I'd only known
the danger

1050
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.710
that I've put you and Kim in.

1051
01:05:22.793 --> 01:05:26.130
I-- I never--
I never would have made

1052
01:05:26.213 --> 01:05:28.049
this stupid documentary.

1053
01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:33.930
Well. I'll just ask
for some extra college credit

1054
01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:36.766
when I get back.

1055
01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:40.519
I mean I definitely had no idea

1056
01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:45.024
that there was gonna be
real aliens up here.

1057
01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.817
I mean you really
shouldn't be blaming yourself

1058
01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:48.110
for this.

1059
01:05:50.988 --> 01:05:54.909
Blake and Candie are dead.

1060
01:05:54.992 --> 01:06:00.331
because I didn't take
this shit seriously enough

1061
01:06:00.414 --> 01:06:02.917
to come prepared for the worst.

1062
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.878
They-- they trusted me to know

1063
01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:09.590
what we were getting
ourselves into.

1064
01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:13.302
I can never forgive myself
for what happened.

1065
01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.356
I swear I will do everything
I can to make sure

1066
01:06:25.439 --> 01:06:29.235
that you and Kim
get back home safely.

1067
01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:34.365
It's really not your fault.

1068
01:06:36.575 --> 01:06:40.037
I know it's gonna take a while
for you to understand that

1069
01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:42.331
and I know how you feel.

1070
01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:43.833
I was the one
that convinced Kim

1071
01:06:43.916 --> 01:06:46.752
that this was just gonna be
another camping trip.

1072
01:06:48.879 --> 01:06:51.465
She didn't have to come.
but she insisted on going.

1073
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:56.804
because well. I'm a dumbass

1074
01:06:56.887 --> 01:06:59.557
and I always find ways
to get into trouble.

1075
01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:06.022
She doesn't blame you at all
and neither do I.

1076
01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:08.232
It's really all of our faults.

1077
01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:18.075
You know. we better find a cave
or something

1078
01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:20.619
or we're gonna have a little
different set of problems

1079
01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.038
if you know what I mean.

1080
01:07:23.622 --> 01:07:26.083
You think we can find somethin'
before it gets too dark?

1081
01:07:28.335 --> 01:07:30.379
(Sighing)

1082
01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:31.756
I don't know.

1083
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.388
I was gonna suggest
we should probably uh. split up

1084
01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:45.019
and look. but I'm pretty sure
we would both get lost.

1085
01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:50.191
Now. that's a deep thought.

1086
01:07:50.274 --> 01:07:56.363
Getting lost while we're lost.

1087
01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:59.116
It's like a lost inception.

1088
01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:04.580
(Chuckling)

1089
01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:13.172
Are you ready to get movin'?

1090
01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:15.633
I was just getting comfortable.

1091
01:08:15.716 --> 01:08:17.885
So was I.

1092
01:08:43.244 --> 01:08:44.620
Yo. Glen!

Thomas. we don't have the time
for this.

1095

Don't fall asleep.

the purpose

01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:30.190
Did you sleep well?

1253
01:24:30.273 --> 01:24:32.692
No. but I'm feeling better.

1254
01:24:32.776 --> 01:24:34.568
Well. how's your leg?

1255
01:24:34.652 --> 01:24:36.154
I think I can feel it now.

1256
01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:37.072
LILY:
They're back.

1257
01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:47.165
(♪♪♪)

1258
01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:00.719
Where'd they go?

1259
01:25:00.804 --> 01:25:02.138
GLEN:
I don't know.

1260
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:09.103
(Thudding and rumbling)

1261
01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:11.314
(Growling)

1262
01:25:11.397 --> 01:25:20.698
(♪♪♪)

1263
01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:22.117
(Gunshot)

1264
01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:27.705
Thomas.
give me another shell now!

1265
01:25:33.837 --> 01:25:35.171
(Gunshot)

1266
01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:41.761
(Grunting)

1267
01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:54.398
(♪♪♪)

1268
01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:09.496
Are you alright?

1269
01:26:09.581 --> 01:26:10.582
(Sobbing)

1270
01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:12.125
I'm not.

1271
01:26:13.751 --> 01:26:15.378
They keep breaking in.

1272
01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:17.630
We're practically out of ammo.

1273
01:26:21.885 --> 01:26:24.596
Blake and Candie are dead.

1274
01:26:26.764 --> 01:26:28.975
And I don't want us
to end up like them.

1275
01:26:29.058 --> 01:26:30.934
(Sobbing)

1276
01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:32.687
You got us this far.

1277
01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:36.900
We need to keep fighting.

1278
01:26:36.983 --> 01:26:38.193
Fighting together.

1279
01:26:38.276 --> 01:26:40.361
(Sniffling)

1280
01:26:47.785 --> 01:26:50.288
What's important.

1281
01:26:50.371 --> 01:26:54.166
What's really important is that
we have each other.

1282
01:26:58.296 --> 01:27:00.089
I love you so much.

1283
01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:07.013
What would I ever do
without you?

1284
01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:12.101
You'd be sad and alone.

1285
01:27:12.184 --> 01:27:22.195
(♪♪♪)

1286
01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:27.951
THOMAS:
Uh. guys. you might wanna
look out the window.

1287
01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:37.585
(Growling)

1288
01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:43.091
Alright. Thomas. you need
to get me some more ammo.

1289
01:27:43.174 --> 01:27:45.510
About that.
there isn't any left.

1290
01:27:47.303 --> 01:27:49.430
Okay. well. there's got to be
more around here.

1291
01:27:49.514 --> 01:27:52.058
I already checked. but whatever
makes you feel better.

1292
01:27:52.141 --> 01:27:54.434
Alright. well.
just help me look.

1293
01:27:54.519 --> 01:28:04.529
(♪♪♪)

1294
01:28:16.374 --> 01:28:19.294
LILY:
Hey guys. I found something.

1295
01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:30.221
(♪♪♪)

1296
01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:33.474
Whoever owned this cabin
must have been a serious hunter.

1297
01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:35.309
Yeah. no kidding.

1298
01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:36.978
Well. we can definitely
use those.

1299
01:28:37.061 --> 01:28:37.728
Yeah.

1300
01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:40.189
What is it?

1301
01:28:40.273 --> 01:28:41.898
Oh. just another kinda
boomstick.

1302
01:28:41.983 --> 01:28:44.110
Be careful with those.

1303
01:28:44.193 --> 01:28:46.404
Oh. it's okay as long
as you don't drop it.

1304
01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:53.995
(♪♪♪)

1305
01:28:54.077 --> 01:28:57.707
You guys. we can't stay here
especially without ammo.

1306
01:28:57.790 --> 01:29:00.335
This is what I think
we should do.

1307
01:29:00.418 --> 01:29:02.670
Wait for it to get close.
light the dynamite.

1308
01:29:02.754 --> 01:29:04.547
then get out as fast as we can.

1309
01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:06.049
By the time it breaks in.
it should be ready to--

1310
01:29:06.132 --> 01:29:07.550
Kaboom!

1311
01:29:07.633 --> 01:29:09.802
Exactly.

1312
01:29:09.886 --> 01:29:12.805
Well. sounds like it could work.

1313
01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:14.474
Uh. guys.
I don't mean to be pushing.

1314
01:29:14.557 --> 01:29:17.101
but we got like
T-minus 35 times

1315
01:29:17.184 --> 01:29:18.728
whatever to get out of here.

1316
01:29:18.811 --> 01:29:19.853
Get Kim to the door--

1317
01:29:19.937 --> 01:29:21.064
- Alright.
- I'll get this one.

1318
01:29:21.147 --> 01:29:31.157
(♪♪♪)

1319
01:29:33.868 --> 01:29:35.452
(Growling)

1320
01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:36.537
Get ready.

1321
01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:46.630
(♪♪♪)

1322
01:29:58.768 --> 01:30:00.395
Now!

1323
01:30:00.478 --> 01:30:10.487
(♪♪♪)

1324
01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:24.794
(Growling)

1325
01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:32.593
Do you think she lit it?

1326
01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:33.636
Of course. I did.

1327
01:30:33.719 --> 01:30:34.971
KIM:
Maybe it's a dud.

1328
01:30:35.054 --> 01:30:36.556
(Growling)

1329
01:30:36.639 --> 01:30:39.892
(Explosion)

1330
01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:40.934
(Chuckling)

1331
01:30:41.018 --> 01:30:42.270
I think we got it.

1332
01:30:42.353 --> 01:30:43.353
(Chuckling)

1333
01:30:44.814 --> 01:30:47.316
I'll admit for a moment there
I thought for sure

1334
01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.318
- we were all dead.
- For a moment?

1335
01:30:49.402 --> 01:30:50.862
I've been thinkin' that
since day one.

1336
01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:52.447
I'm just glad it's over.

1337
01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:54.490
Well. it's not over yet.
we're still lost.

1338
01:30:54.574 --> 01:30:56.159
Okay. but it could be
a lot worse.

1339
01:30:58.077 --> 01:31:00.538
Right. we need to get moving.

1340
01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:01.539
(Taking deep breaths)

1341
01:31:01.621 --> 01:31:03.458
Which way?

1342
01:31:03.541 --> 01:31:04.834
Same way we've been going.

1343
01:31:04.916 --> 01:31:14.927
(♪♪♪)

1344
01:31:25.771 --> 01:31:28.191
I'm in love with a road.

1345
01:31:28.273 --> 01:31:29.150
(Chuckling)

1346
01:31:29.233 --> 01:31:31.110
Oh. I missed you!

1347
01:31:31.193 --> 01:31:32.278
Here. take some of these.

1348
01:31:32.361 --> 01:31:33.821
I got plenty more
where that came from.

1349
01:31:33.905 --> 01:31:34.989
And now. we're rich.

1350
01:31:35.072 --> 01:31:35.948
With happiness.

1351
01:31:36.032 --> 01:31:37.200
(Chuckling)

1352
01:31:37.282 --> 01:31:39.577
Um. which way do we walk now?

1353
01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.871
I think
we just keep walking on down.

1354
01:31:41.954 --> 01:31:45.333
Yeah. I've been wanting
to do that all day.

1355
01:31:45.416 --> 01:31:47.001
Okay. that sounds like a plan.

1356
01:31:47.084 --> 01:31:48.085
Okay.

1357
01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:58.179
