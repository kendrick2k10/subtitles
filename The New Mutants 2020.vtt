00:00:36.577 --> 00:00:40.515
<i>There's an old Native
American proverb that says...</i>

4
00:00:40.548 --> 00:00:43.484
<i>inside every person.
there are two bears...</i>

5
00:00:43.518 --> 00:00:45.919
<i>forever locked in combat
for your soul.</i>

6
00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:49.022
<i>One bear is all things good.</i>

7
00:00:49.056 --> 00:00:52.527
<i>Compassion. love. trust.</i>

8
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.530
<i>The other is all things evil.</i>

9
00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.299
<i>Fear. shame.</i>

10
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.468
<i>and self-destruction.</i>

11
00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:06.474
- What's happening?
- We have to run...

12
00:01:06.507 --> 00:01:08.276
as fast as we can!

13
00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:09.976
Wait!

14
00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:18.653
Don't let go of my hand!

15
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.406
What's happening?

16
00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:41.242
Here! Hide here!

17
00:01:42.943 --> 00:01:44.412
I have to go help them.

18
00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:46.214
- No! No. Dad. please!
- Dani!

19
00:01:46.247 --> 00:01:47.981
Please don't leave me alone!

20
00:01:48.014 --> 00:01:50.218
Dani.
I have to go back.

21
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:51.252
Stay here.

22
00:01:55.122 --> 00:01:56.257
Hey!

23
00:01:57.492 --> 00:02:00.294
Run! No! Get away!

24
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:01.596
Run!

25
00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:04.365
No!

26
00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:29.183
Hello?

27
00:03:39.092 --> 00:03:42.597
Hello? Let me out of here!

28
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.764
<i>Relax. Dani.</i>

29
00:03:43.798 --> 00:03:45.600
<i>I'm on my way to you.</i>

30
00:03:51.706 --> 00:03:54.709
Where am I?
Where is my family?

31
00:03:54.742 --> 00:03:58.346
I know you're scared.
but you're safe now.

32
00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.449
If I could come in.
I'll explain.

33
00:04:01.482 --> 00:04:02.750
Would that be
all right?

34
00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:14.127
Doors. Infirmary.

35
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:25.105
Hi. Dani.

36
00:04:25.138 --> 00:04:26.707
I'm Dr. Reyes.

37
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:29.176
If you take a seat.
I'll free your hand.

38
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.825
Dani. what I'm about
to tell you...

39
00:04:44.859 --> 00:04:47.328
is going to be
very difficult.

40
00:04:49.297 --> 00:04:52.433
An F5 tornado touched down
on your reservation.

41
00:04:54.435 --> 00:04:55.369
No.

42
00:04:55.403 --> 00:04:58.239
You're the sole survivor
of a terrible tragedy.

43
00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.241
No. no.

44
00:05:03.177 --> 00:05:06.747
It was growling!
Something was chasing us!

45
00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:08.316
What?

46
00:05:11.285 --> 00:05:13.554
Sometimes trauma makes us
remember things...

47
00:05:13.588 --> 00:05:14.755
that aren't real.

48
00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:20.461
Here.

49
00:05:20.494 --> 00:05:23.129
I think this may be yours.

50
00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.267
I'm really sorry.

51
00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.451
Why didn't I just die
with them?

52
00:05:44.752 --> 00:05:46.152
Why me?

53
00:05:46.187 --> 00:05:48.789
Survivor's guilt is a
common reaction to trauma.

54
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.591
We look for reasons.

55
00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:54.795
Most of the time.
we find none.

56
00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:56.330
But the reason
you survived...

57
00:05:57.798 --> 00:06:00.368
is because you're
a very uncommon girl.

58
00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:05.439
Your reservation was wiped
off the face of the earth.

59
00:06:05.473 --> 00:06:07.808
But you made it out
with barely a scratch.

60
00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:12.780
Do you know
what mutants are?

61
00:06:14.615 --> 00:06:17.418
Mutation most often
occurs in puberty.

62
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:21.355
You might spend the first
13 years of your life...

63
00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:22.556
relatively normal.

64
00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.726
Then. just like that...

65
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.763
you come of age and
discover your true nature.

66
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:32.767
What's my true nature?

67
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.502
We'll have to figure
that out together.

68
00:06:38.506 --> 00:06:40.274
Then how do you know
I'm a mutant?

69
00:06:40.307 --> 00:06:41.442
The man I work for

70
00:06:41.475 --> 00:06:43.444
has a way of recognizing
new mutants...

71
00:06:43.477 --> 00:06:45.846
the moment their condition
reveals itself.

72
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.482
That's how
we discovered you

73
00:06:48.516 --> 00:06:49.717
and your
fellow patients.

74
00:06:52.253 --> 00:06:54.522
You're not alone. Dani.

75
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.397
This is a facility for
young mutants like yourself.

76
00:07:03.431 --> 00:07:04.965
Teens who need
some extra care...

77
00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:08.636
before they can go on to
live healthy adult lives.

78
00:07:11.505 --> 00:07:14.608
There's some warm clothes.
Toiletries.

79
00:07:20.414 --> 00:07:22.283
How long do I have
to stay here?

80
00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:24.385
Until I decide
you're not a danger.

81
00:07:24.852 --> 00:07:26.554
Danger to who?

82
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:28.823
Yourself.

83
00:07:33.928 --> 00:07:35.529
You have been through a lot.

84
00:07:37.531 --> 00:07:38.799
Get some rest. okay?

85
00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:42.036
We'll talk more
in the morning.

86
00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:43.270
Dr. Reyes.

87
00:07:46.006 --> 00:07:48.242
There's really
no one left?

88
00:07:50.711 --> 00:07:53.547
But you're
in a safe place now.

89
00:07:53.581 --> 00:07:55.850
Nothing can hurt you
in here. Dani.

90
00:07:56.884 --> 00:07:58.452
Good night.

91
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:15.035
Yesterday. I asked you
to think about...

92
00:08:15.069 --> 00:08:17.605
the first time
your mutation manifested.

93
00:08:20.608 --> 00:08:22.943
Would anyone like to share?

94
00:08:22.977 --> 00:08:24.411
Sam?

95
00:08:25.713 --> 00:08:26.714
Illyana?

96
00:08:29.517 --> 00:08:30.584
Roberto?

97
00:08:32.086 --> 00:08:33.988
Rahne?

98
00:08:34.021 --> 00:08:38.893
Look. we can't help each other
unless we talk to each other.

99
00:08:38.926 --> 00:08:41.495
I've said this
a hundred times.

100
00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:46.467
This program can't help you
if you refuse to participate.

101
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.870
So. Rahne.
why don't you start?

102
00:08:51.872 --> 00:08:52.873
I...

103
00:08:57.978 --> 00:08:59.647
Please join us. Dani.

104
00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:04.652
This is our new patient.
Danielle Moonstar.

105
00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.456
Oh. it's serious.

106
00:09:11.725 --> 00:09:14.361
Let's do our best
to make her feel at home.

107
00:09:14.995 --> 00:09:16.897
Go ahead. Rahne.

108
00:09:19.834 --> 00:09:20.835
Right.

109
00:09:22.436 --> 00:09:23.537
I was 13.

110
00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.475
I remember running
through the woods.

111
00:09:31.545 --> 00:09:32.980
<i>How did you feel?</i>

112
00:09:33.447 --> 00:09:34.615
Free.

113
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.653
Like. the most free
I'd felt my whole life.

114
00:09:42.556 --> 00:09:44.391
But guilty. too.

115
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.127
Why guilty?

116
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.099
Because I knew it was bad.

117
00:09:54.568 --> 00:09:56.570
I went to Reverend Craig...

118
00:09:56.604 --> 00:09:58.539
to see if he could
pray it out of me.

119
00:09:59.773 --> 00:10:04.678
He asked me to show him.
so I changed.

120
00:10:04.712 --> 00:10:06.780
And what did
Reverend Craig do?

121
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.052
Beat me
about half to death.

122
00:10:12.853 --> 00:10:14.555
Said I was a witch...

123
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.992
that I was going to hell.

124
00:10:25.933 --> 00:10:28.702
Would anyone else like
to share their first time?

125
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.438
New girl.

126
00:10:32.072 --> 00:10:33.707
How fucked up are you?

127
00:10:33.741 --> 00:10:35.943
- Illyana.
- Drugs. I bet.

128
00:10:35.976 --> 00:10:38.445
Or a nympho. maybe.
Hopefully.

129
00:10:38.479 --> 00:10:39.513
Keep behaving...

130
00:10:39.546 --> 00:10:40.547
exactly like you are
right now...

131
00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:42.917
and we can all just spend
the day in solitary.

132
00:10:45.653 --> 00:10:48.055
I want all of you
to think very carefully...

133
00:10:48.088 --> 00:10:50.124
about how you'd like to use
your time here.

134
00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:53.694
And how long
you want that time to be.

135
00:10:55.596 --> 00:10:57.765
Illyana.
since you're already up...

136
00:10:57.798 --> 00:10:59.533
why don't you show
Dani around?

137
00:10:59.566 --> 00:11:01.068
And why do I have to?

138
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.571
Because I'm asking you.

139
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:08.909
How long
have you been here?

140
00:11:10.778 --> 00:11:12.680
Are there
any other doctors?

141
00:11:14.014 --> 00:11:15.516
- Why aren't you...
- Shh.

142
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.619
What's that.
Lockheed?

143
00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:22.723
Oh. I know.

144
00:11:23.924 --> 00:11:25.526
I hate her. too.

145
00:11:35.002 --> 00:11:36.837
Dr. Reyes!

146
00:11:40.174 --> 00:11:42.576
Main building. Dorms.

147
00:11:42.609 --> 00:11:44.545
Chapel. if you believe
in that shit.

148
00:11:44.578 --> 00:11:46.580
And garden.

149
00:11:46.613 --> 00:11:48.582
You don't know how
to grow weed. do you?

150
00:11:48.615 --> 00:11:49.650
No.

151
00:11:50.718 --> 00:11:52.886
What kind of
Indian are you?

152
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:55.055
Cheyenne.

153
00:11:55.889 --> 00:11:57.725
I wasn't actually asking.

154
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:05.132
You're my lookout.

155
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.841
Where are we?

156
00:12:13.874 --> 00:12:15.576
Who knows?

157
00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:17.077
Dr. Reyes always says...

158
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:19.513
the closest town
is 20 miles away.

159
00:12:20.647 --> 00:12:22.683
But she could be lying...

160
00:12:22.716 --> 00:12:24.852
to keep us
from trying to escape.

161
00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:26.887
There's no fence.

162
00:12:27.222 --> 00:12:28.555
Nope.

163
00:12:28.922 --> 00:12:30.291
No fence.

164
00:12:30.325 --> 00:12:34.195
Nothing between you
and freedom.

165
00:12:41.668 --> 00:12:44.138
Run. new girl. run!

166
00:12:50.077 --> 00:12:51.078
Faster!

167
00:13:28.882 --> 00:13:31.952
Aw. This isn't a hospital.
Pocahontas.

168
00:13:33.654 --> 00:13:35.722
It's a cage.

169
00:13:35.756 --> 00:13:37.624
And now you're trapped
in it forever.

170
00:13:41.728 --> 00:13:44.232
Man. I really
should have warned you.

171
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.337
- I have to go to help them.
- No! No. Dad. please!

172
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.871
- <i>Dani!</i>
- <i>Please don't leave me alone!</i>

173
00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:25.806
<i>Survivor's guilt is
a common reaction to trauma.</i>

174
00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:27.741
Stay here!

175
00:14:27.774 --> 00:14:29.676
<i>You're the sole survivor.</i>

176
00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:34.942
What are you doing
out here?

177
00:15:35.343 --> 00:15:37.110
Sorry.

178
00:15:37.144 --> 00:15:39.180
I didn't mean
to scare you.

179
00:15:44.117 --> 00:15:47.488
Wow. this is
really high up.

180
00:15:47.522 --> 00:15:49.490
A fall from here
would mess you up.

181
00:15:50.857 --> 00:15:52.092
It would kill me.

182
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.161
Instantly.

183
00:15:54.195 --> 00:15:56.364
I wouldn't feel a thing.

184
00:15:57.365 --> 00:15:59.400
I want to get
out of here. too...

185
00:16:00.301 --> 00:16:02.169
but not like this.

186
00:16:03.904 --> 00:16:07.774
My home is gone.
My dad's dead.

187
00:16:09.109 --> 00:16:12.513
Where I'm from. we believe
suicides go straight to hell.

188
00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:18.286
Always kinda scared me
out of giving it a go.

189
00:16:18.319 --> 00:16:22.190
I don't wanna be here.
I wanna be with my family.

190
00:16:23.224 --> 00:16:26.827
If they're gone
and you're here...

191
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.895
maybe it's
for a reason.

192
00:16:28.929 --> 00:16:32.099
Maybe it's not time
to be with them just yet.

193
00:16:32.132 --> 00:16:33.934
But I'm all alone.

194
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.006
There's two people
up here.

195
00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:43.278
You calling me a nobody?

196
00:16:45.145 --> 00:16:47.014
Please.

197
00:16:47.047 --> 00:16:48.982
It's going to get better.

198
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:52.520
I promise.

199
00:17:18.912 --> 00:17:21.148
Let's live a little longer.
Dani Moonstar.

200
00:17:24.385 --> 00:17:26.387
Dani. where were you?

201
00:17:28.155 --> 00:17:29.390
- Uh...
- I was just...

202
00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:31.158
showing her
the chapel.

203
00:17:31.192 --> 00:17:32.959
No one is ever to be
unaccounted for. Rahne.

204
00:17:32.993 --> 00:17:34.027
You know that.

205
00:17:34.061 --> 00:17:35.463
I'm sorry.
Dr. Reyes.

206
00:17:36.331 --> 00:17:37.432
Okay.

207
00:17:40.234 --> 00:17:42.303
Did I just
get you in trouble?

208
00:17:42.337 --> 00:17:44.238
It's okay.
She likes me.

209
00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:47.174
I'm one of the good ones.
Me and Sam.

210
00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.220
Holy shit.
I thought he just exploded.

211
00:17:59.253 --> 00:18:00.621
No.

212
00:18:00.655 --> 00:18:02.557
That's his thing.
He can blast off.

213
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.193
Zero to 100
like a cannonball.

214
00:18:07.528 --> 00:18:09.297
Not so good at landing.
though.

215
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.366
Is this.
like. practice?

216
00:18:12.266 --> 00:18:14.602
I don't know.

217
00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:16.136
Sometimes it seems
like he's out here...

218
00:18:16.169 --> 00:18:17.338
just trying
to hurt himself.

219
00:18:20.541 --> 00:18:22.643
He grew up
in a small town in Kentucky.

220
00:18:22.677 --> 00:18:24.479
Did really well in school...

221
00:18:24.512 --> 00:18:26.947
but had to drop out to work
in the mines with his dad.

222
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.082
Help the family and all.

223
00:18:29.116 --> 00:18:30.251
Poor guy.

224
00:18:30.284 --> 00:18:32.587
Right? Poor guy.

225
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.055
And then there's Roberto.

226
00:18:35.088 --> 00:18:37.492
His family's. like.
the richest family in Brazil.

227
00:18:40.361 --> 00:18:41.928
Thanks. doggy.

228
00:18:41.962 --> 00:18:44.699
Probably living the sweet
life before he got here.

229
00:18:44.732 --> 00:18:46.967
Something must have
gone really wrong.

230
00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:49.102
What's his power?

231
00:18:49.136 --> 00:18:52.273
He won't tell.
but he's got something.

232
00:18:52.306 --> 00:18:54.275
Parents sent him here
to be cured.

233
00:18:54.308 --> 00:18:56.310
Is there a cure
for being an asshole?

234
00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:58.179
Maybe he's just
the crazy one.

235
00:18:58.212 --> 00:19:00.681
No.
That spot's taken.

236
00:19:06.254 --> 00:19:07.954
Well. I really
enjoyed spending...

237
00:19:07.988 --> 00:19:10.425
the day with you. Dani.
but I should go.

238
00:19:10.458 --> 00:19:12.959
We're not supposed to be
in each other's rooms and...

239
00:19:12.993 --> 00:19:15.296
Why is she always
watching us?

240
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.132
For our own good.

241
00:19:19.166 --> 00:19:21.669
She means well.
She's trying to help us.

242
00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:24.372
If you follow the treatment.
you'll get out of here. Dani.

243
00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:28.041
Probably before
the rest of us cuckoos.

244
00:19:29.677 --> 00:19:31.679
Well. night.

245
00:19:33.281 --> 00:19:34.282
Rahne?

246
00:19:37.785 --> 00:19:39.620
Thank you for helping me.

247
00:19:40.354 --> 00:19:42.323
What do I know?

248
00:19:42.356 --> 00:19:44.325
Maybe we both
should have jumped.

249
00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:17.090
Dish duty is really
trimming down the wardrobe.

250
00:20:17.123 --> 00:20:19.092
Every time
your shirt gets dirty...

251
00:20:19.125 --> 00:20:21.127
you just throw it away?

252
00:20:23.331 --> 00:20:25.366
Here. It's all yours.

253
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.101
Cool.

254
00:20:29.804 --> 00:20:31.205
Was it scary?

255
00:20:32.072 --> 00:20:33.307
Working in the mines?

256
00:20:34.742 --> 00:20:36.777
Yeah. Yeah. sure.

257
00:20:45.419 --> 00:20:47.153
<i>No!</i>

258
00:20:53.361 --> 00:20:54.462
Oh. Jesus.

259
00:20:54.495 --> 00:20:55.730
I got it.

260
00:20:58.199 --> 00:20:59.433
You couldn't pay me
a million dollars...

261
00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:01.736
to go in one of
those things.

262
00:21:01.769 --> 00:21:04.170
I couldn't pay you a
million dollars anyway.

263
00:21:04.205 --> 00:21:06.274
When we get out of here.
I'll spot ya.

264
00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:07.408
My folks are good for it.

265
00:21:08.108 --> 00:21:09.544
Night. Kentucky.

266
00:21:09.577 --> 00:21:10.811
Night. man.

267
00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.392
Hello?

268
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.429
Somebody!

269
00:23:00.488 --> 00:23:02.155
Dad?

270
00:23:03.858 --> 00:23:05.259
Samuel.

271
00:23:06.961 --> 00:23:08.796
What did you do?

272
00:23:49.737 --> 00:23:50.938
Oops.

273
00:24:04.351 --> 00:24:06.954
There aren't any cameras
in here. are there?

274
00:24:06.987 --> 00:24:09.557
Only safe place
in the building.

275
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.992
But there could
still be mics. so... Shh.

276
00:24:28.843 --> 00:24:32.379
Wow. that's. um...
That's some serious body art.

277
00:24:33.981 --> 00:24:36.283
Tattoo wasn't
painful enough?

278
00:24:36.884 --> 00:24:38.753
It wasn't my idea.

279
00:24:40.921 --> 00:24:42.723
What's it stand for?

280
00:24:49.964 --> 00:24:52.266
I'm sorry. I don't want
to talk about it.

281
00:25:18.793 --> 00:25:20.027
<i>Control.</i>

282
00:25:27.802 --> 00:25:30.304
Control.

283
00:25:37.745 --> 00:25:40.047
Control.

284
00:25:47.154 --> 00:25:49.657
Control.

285
00:25:54.662 --> 00:25:57.097
Control.

286
00:26:00.701 --> 00:26:02.970
And...

287
00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:08.609
control.

288
00:26:08.642 --> 00:26:10.644
- <i>Darling.</i>
- <i>I can't do this.</i>

289
00:26:10.678 --> 00:26:13.414
I have one arm.
It takes two.

290
00:26:17.017 --> 00:26:18.652
<i>We can do this.</i>

291
00:26:22.423 --> 00:26:24.024
Hey. Standing Rock.

292
00:26:24.892 --> 00:26:26.760
You want a buffalo wing?

293
00:26:28.429 --> 00:26:30.564
You people love buffalo.
don't you?

294
00:26:30.598 --> 00:26:31.632
Jeez. Illya.
will you just...

295
00:26:31.665 --> 00:26:32.900
- leave her alone?
- No.

296
00:26:33.701 --> 00:26:34.969
It's okay.

297
00:26:36.737 --> 00:26:40.174
"Standing Rock."
That's a good one.

298
00:26:40.208 --> 00:26:42.409
More original
than "Pocahontas."

299
00:26:43.944 --> 00:26:46.046
That was huge
in fifth grade.

300
00:26:47.147 --> 00:26:48.849
You don't scare me.

301
00:26:48.883 --> 00:26:51.151
My dad told me
about bitches like you.

302
00:26:51.186 --> 00:26:52.386
Oh.

303
00:26:54.555 --> 00:26:56.156
Well. here.

304
00:26:56.191 --> 00:26:57.691
Why don't you show us
on the puppet...

305
00:26:57.725 --> 00:26:58.826
where Daddy touched you?

306
00:27:00.228 --> 00:27:02.129
- Lockheed!
- Hey. guys. come on!

307
00:27:02.162 --> 00:27:04.765
You keep my father's name
out of your mouth. bitch!

308
00:27:06.834 --> 00:27:08.002
You don't know
anything about me.

309
00:27:08.035 --> 00:27:09.503
Do you know anything?

310
00:27:09.536 --> 00:27:11.705
Sixteen years old and
doesn't even know her power.

311
00:27:11.739 --> 00:27:13.507
Seems like that mutant period
should've kicked in by now.

312
00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.642
- Leave her alone.
- Yo. Hold up.

313
00:27:14.675 --> 00:27:16.477
I'm helping her.
This is therapy!

314
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.680
- Get your hands off me.
- Or you'll what?

315
00:27:19.713 --> 00:27:22.217
Let's find out.
What are you gonna do. huh?

316
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:24.752
Fuck! Bitch!

317
00:27:28.956 --> 00:27:30.591
Illyana. don't!

318
00:27:31.959 --> 00:27:33.560
You know the rules.

319
00:27:34.161 --> 00:27:35.663
No powers in here.

320
00:27:35.696 --> 00:27:36.830
And definitely no fighting.

321
00:27:40.601 --> 00:27:42.703
Sorry. Doctor.

322
00:27:42.736 --> 00:27:44.672
I thought maybe Dani
was invincible.

323
00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.942
Just wanted to see
if I was right.

324
00:27:47.975 --> 00:27:50.044
Solitary. Both of you.

325
00:27:50.077 --> 00:27:51.478
But it wasn't
Dani's...

326
00:27:51.512 --> 00:27:54.615
Everyone else.
lights out in 10.

327
00:27:57.885 --> 00:27:59.920
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Mmm.

328
00:28:00.788 --> 00:28:02.523
I'll see you
in hell.

329
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.494
Come on.

330
00:28:15.903 --> 00:28:17.638
What's that. Lockheed?

331
00:28:18.639 --> 00:28:20.208
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

332
00:28:23.944 --> 00:28:26.480
We'll go to our
special place. okay?

333
00:28:29.184 --> 00:28:32.486
The Smiling Men can't get us
in our special place.

334
00:30:08.183 --> 00:30:09.184
Dani?

335
00:30:12.152 --> 00:30:13.987
What's happening to me?

336
00:30:30.771 --> 00:30:32.739
You're clearly
manifesting something...

337
00:30:32.773 --> 00:30:35.843
but we need to do more tests
to find out what it is.

338
00:30:35.876 --> 00:30:38.979
It's okay.
I'm a doctor.

339
00:30:39.012 --> 00:30:41.815
Actually. I come from
a family of doctors.

340
00:30:41.849 --> 00:30:43.351
My mother was a vet.

341
00:30:44.818 --> 00:30:47.388
A lot of pets came in
with rattlesnake bites.

342
00:30:48.989 --> 00:30:52.260
Did you know baby rattlesnakes
are more dangerous...

343
00:30:52.293 --> 00:30:55.028
than adult ones?

344
00:30:55.062 --> 00:30:56.864
They haven't learned
how to control...

345
00:30:56.897 --> 00:30:59.166
how much venom
they secrete.

346
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.203
Even the mutants
we call heroes today...

347
00:31:02.237 --> 00:31:04.771
when they first
got their powers...

348
00:31:04.805 --> 00:31:06.640
chances are
they hurt someone.

349
00:31:07.841 --> 00:31:10.311
That's why new mutants
are dangerous.

350
00:31:11.778 --> 00:31:14.081
- And they need to be...
- Locked up?

351
00:31:15.949 --> 00:31:18.286
Sequestered...

352
00:31:18.319 --> 00:31:22.689
from average humans.
for their safety and ours.

353
00:31:24.825 --> 00:31:25.826
Put pressure.

354
00:31:51.386 --> 00:31:54.355
Forgive me. Father.
for I have sinned.

355
00:31:56.191 --> 00:31:58.259
It's been a week
since my last confession.

356
00:31:58.293 --> 00:32:01.895
My superior runs
a facility for gifted mutants.

357
00:32:01.929 --> 00:32:04.765
You could move there after
this. if you wanted to.

358
00:32:04.798 --> 00:32:07.067
Rahne said I could even
get out of here faster...

359
00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.936
if I follow your program.

360
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.138
I've noticed
you and Rahne...

361
00:32:11.171 --> 00:32:13.374
have taken a liking
to each other.

362
00:32:13.408 --> 00:32:16.109
That's good.
She's a good influence.

363
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:18.812
And she's right.

364
00:32:18.845 --> 00:32:22.816
It's important we find out
exactly what your power is...

365
00:32:22.849 --> 00:32:24.818
so we can help you
control it.

366
00:32:28.289 --> 00:32:30.191
I masturbated twice.

367
00:32:31.058 --> 00:32:33.428
I lied to Dr. Reyes.

368
00:32:33.461 --> 00:32:35.296
And I was up
in the vents again.

369
00:32:40.501 --> 00:32:41.802
Hello?

370
00:32:46.006 --> 00:32:48.809
I'm gonna say one Our Father
and two Hail Marys. okay?

371
00:32:53.281 --> 00:32:54.382
Hello?

372
00:33:06.461 --> 00:33:07.528
Who's there?

373
00:33:08.296 --> 00:33:09.297
<i>Witch!</i>

374
00:33:11.332 --> 00:33:12.467
<i>You witch!</i>

375
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.034
<i>I'll flay the flesh</i>

376
00:33:14.067 --> 00:33:16.371
<i>from your bones!</i>

377
00:33:16.404 --> 00:33:18.105
Demons can't
come in churches.

378
00:33:18.138 --> 00:33:19.806
Demons can't come in churches.

379
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.442
Demons can't come in churches.

380
00:33:30.418 --> 00:33:32.253
- Hey.
- Hey.

381
00:33:32.287 --> 00:33:33.887
Where have you been?

382
00:33:35.423 --> 00:33:37.090
Are you okay?

383
00:33:37.425 --> 00:33:39.159
Yeah.

384
00:33:39.193 --> 00:33:40.961
Just needed some time
to myself.

385
00:33:40.994 --> 00:33:42.029
Come on.

386
00:33:43.197 --> 00:33:45.300
Where are you guys going?

387
00:33:45.333 --> 00:33:47.067
Reyes is asleep.
so we're going up to the...

388
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.969
To the "never mind.
you're not invited."

389
00:33:49.002 --> 00:33:50.538
Come on. Illy.

390
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:52.172
Come on.
we'll show you.

391
00:33:54.208 --> 00:33:55.410
Whatever.

392
00:34:05.386 --> 00:34:07.854
So. you guys hang out
in an attic?

393
00:34:07.888 --> 00:34:09.290
Yeah.

394
00:34:09.324 --> 00:34:11.459
It's one of the only places
Reyes can't watch us.

395
00:34:11.492 --> 00:34:12.493
It's full of cool shit...

396
00:34:12.527 --> 00:34:15.229
from back before this was even
a place for mutants.

397
00:34:15.263 --> 00:34:17.465
Let's play
a little game.

398
00:34:30.911 --> 00:34:32.145
Dare.

399
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.448
You can't say dare.

400
00:34:34.081 --> 00:34:36.317
Fine. Jesus.

401
00:34:37.618 --> 00:34:38.952
Truth.

402
00:34:42.089 --> 00:34:43.957
How many girls
have you been with?

403
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:45.892
Like I can even remember.

404
00:34:47.195 --> 00:34:48.262
Rahne?

405
00:34:50.097 --> 00:34:51.098
He's lying.

406
00:34:52.333 --> 00:34:55.470
It's a lie detector.
We know.

407
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.105
Fine. Three.

408
00:34:58.138 --> 00:34:59.973
That's not bad.

409
00:35:03.076 --> 00:35:04.612
No. look.

410
00:35:04.645 --> 00:35:06.514
- I told you.
- What?

411
00:35:06.547 --> 00:35:07.948
Why not?

412
00:35:08.483 --> 00:35:10.418
I get too hot.

413
00:35:11.519 --> 00:35:15.021
Yeah. you think it's funny?
Your turn. asshole.

414
00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:25.031
What's the coal for?

415
00:35:26.267 --> 00:35:27.535
My dad gave it to me.

416
00:35:28.669 --> 00:35:30.170
Right before...

417
00:35:32.507 --> 00:35:34.007
he passed.

418
00:35:35.075 --> 00:35:36.377
I'm sorry.

419
00:35:37.712 --> 00:35:39.045
Don't be.

420
00:35:41.148 --> 00:35:43.016
I belong here. so...

421
00:35:43.049 --> 00:35:45.720
I'm not sure
any of us belong here.

422
00:35:45.753 --> 00:35:47.355
I think I do.

423
00:35:47.988 --> 00:35:50.090
Why?

424
00:35:50.123 --> 00:35:52.226
New girl.
he already had his question.

425
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.561
It's your turn.

426
00:35:55.229 --> 00:35:56.963
Aren't you gonna
hook me up?

427
00:35:56.997 --> 00:35:59.600
I don't need a polygraph
to tell if you're lying.

428
00:36:03.538 --> 00:36:04.539
What's your power?

429
00:36:06.574 --> 00:36:08.242
I don't know.

430
00:36:08.276 --> 00:36:10.745
I thought you were
going to say that.

431
00:36:10.778 --> 00:36:12.979
How about
another question?

432
00:36:13.013 --> 00:36:15.015
What's with the stupid bear?

433
00:36:16.651 --> 00:36:18.186
Same as Sam.

434
00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.322
My dad made it for me.

435
00:36:23.591 --> 00:36:24.725
Why?

436
00:36:26.294 --> 00:36:28.429
When I was little.
I was...

437
00:36:31.064 --> 00:36:33.501
I was really afraid
of the dark.

438
00:36:33.534 --> 00:36:35.570
Like. so afraid.
it was impossible...

439
00:36:35.603 --> 00:36:37.338
to get me to go to bed.

440
00:36:37.371 --> 00:36:41.742
So my dad. he told me
a legend of a bear.

441
00:36:43.311 --> 00:36:45.680
A Demon Bear...

442
00:36:45.713 --> 00:36:50.384
that lives inside of us
and feeds off of our fear.

443
00:36:50.418 --> 00:36:52.186
That'll help a kid sleep.

444
00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.721
Shut up. Berto.

445
00:36:55.289 --> 00:36:56.990
So. when you're born...

446
00:36:57.658 --> 00:37:01.496
the bear is tiny and weak.

447
00:37:03.397 --> 00:37:05.131
And the older you get...

448
00:37:06.667 --> 00:37:10.003
the more afraid
we become...

449
00:37:11.672 --> 00:37:14.442
the bigger and the stronger
the bear gets.

450
00:37:17.512 --> 00:37:19.079
My dad. he...

451
00:37:21.382 --> 00:37:23.484
he made this for me so that
I would always remember...

452
00:37:23.518 --> 00:37:26.119
how small it was
when I was born.

453
00:37:28.256 --> 00:37:30.725
So that I would remember
to never be afraid.

454
00:37:34.595 --> 00:37:35.596
Enough.

455
00:37:36.497 --> 00:37:37.532
Let's do this.

456
00:37:46.207 --> 00:37:47.608
Well. come on.

457
00:37:50.545 --> 00:37:52.380
Truth.

458
00:37:52.413 --> 00:37:54.348
Why are you here?

459
00:37:55.516 --> 00:37:57.685
Because I killed 18 men.

460
00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.256
One by one.

461
00:38:03.824 --> 00:38:05.793
With my sword.

462
00:38:05.826 --> 00:38:07.628
<i>And Lockheed.</i>

463
00:38:07.662 --> 00:38:09.196
<i>You're lying.</i>

464
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.464
<i>No. she's not.</i>

465
00:38:10.498 --> 00:38:12.233
<i>You don't believe me?</i>

466
00:38:13.901 --> 00:38:17.338
<i>I'm the most powerful
mutant here.</i>

467
00:38:17.371 --> 00:38:19.707
Today. I'd like to talk
about obedience.

468
00:38:21.509 --> 00:38:23.143
If you want any hope
of moving on...

469
00:38:23.176 --> 00:38:24.879
to my
superior's facility...

470
00:38:24.912 --> 00:38:28.114
it's crucial that I know
you can be trusted.

471
00:38:30.785 --> 00:38:31.852
Yes?

472
00:38:31.886 --> 00:38:35.289
What if we don't wanna move on
to your boss's facility?

473
00:38:35.323 --> 00:38:37.191
You know. what if
I just wanna go home?

474
00:38:37.224 --> 00:38:40.628
Sam. you remember
what happened.

475
00:38:40.661 --> 00:38:43.698
You think they stopped
looking for you?

476
00:38:43.731 --> 00:38:47.568
If you weren't here.
you'd be in prison or worse.

477
00:38:47.602 --> 00:38:49.537
I was...
It was an accident.

478
00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:51.372
You think anyone outside
this room would believe that?

479
00:38:51.405 --> 00:38:53.608
I would.
Sam is a good guy.

480
00:38:53.641 --> 00:38:55.876
Even if I'm not...

481
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:57.511
do I really have to spend...

482
00:38:57.545 --> 00:38:59.180
my whole life in here
for one mistake?

483
00:38:59.213 --> 00:39:00.348
Once you're better...

484
00:39:00.381 --> 00:39:01.716
When am I better?

485
00:39:01.749 --> 00:39:03.517
What's gotten
into you. Sam?

486
00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:05.386
Look.
something's not right.

487
00:39:05.419 --> 00:39:07.855
I'm seeing things.
terrible nightmares.

488
00:39:08.489 --> 00:39:09.690
Uh...

489
00:39:09.724 --> 00:39:11.726
When will I ever get better?

490
00:39:11.759 --> 00:39:14.462
You're better
when I say so.

491
00:39:14.495 --> 00:39:15.863
No. forget it.
It's bullshit.

492
00:39:15.896 --> 00:39:17.398
You're not listening
to me.

493
00:39:46.827 --> 00:39:48.829
What did you do to her?

494
00:39:48.863 --> 00:39:51.465
I may have
spiked her tea.

495
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.249
Hold those bag of bones
together. man!

496
00:40:08.282 --> 00:40:09.316
Whoa!

497
00:40:19.927 --> 00:40:21.262
Whoo!

498
00:40:21.295 --> 00:40:23.798
Indubitably.
it's indisputable...

499
00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:27.668
that you are the absolute
worst mutants I've ever seen.

500
00:40:27.702 --> 00:40:31.906
Ergo. my superior will be
very. very disappointed in me.

501
00:40:31.939 --> 00:40:34.809
I surmise I may even
receive a spanking...

502
00:40:34.842 --> 00:40:36.444
for being so. so bad.

503
00:40:36.477 --> 00:40:38.446
Oh. Oh. my superior!

504
00:40:39.647 --> 00:40:42.483
Yeah. who is this superior
she's always talking about?

505
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:44.318
Isn't it obvious?

506
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:46.854
You know who
the X-Men are. right?

507
00:40:46.887 --> 00:40:50.324
Yeah. It's just.
why would we wanna be X-Men?

508
00:40:50.357 --> 00:40:52.760
Right. I ain't wearing no suit
and fighting people. I'm rich.

509
00:40:52.793 --> 00:40:54.595
What. they pay you
to be X-Men now?

510
00:40:54.628 --> 00:40:56.497
I wouldn't mind
being an X-Man.

511
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:57.965
And why would
they need a dog?

512
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:04.338
Children.

513
00:41:06.474 --> 00:41:07.675
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

514
00:41:08.676 --> 00:41:09.944
Where?

515
00:41:09.977 --> 00:41:11.378
It's a surprise.

516
00:41:18.085 --> 00:41:19.720
What are those two
up to?

517
00:41:20.921 --> 00:41:21.989
Cheers.

518
00:41:23.657 --> 00:41:25.960
Rahne. wait.

519
00:41:25.993 --> 00:41:27.728
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

520
00:41:27.762 --> 00:41:29.830
Yeah. I can see
in the dark.

521
00:41:29.864 --> 00:41:32.266
Just follow me.

522
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:36.904
<i>You know
how much trouble...</i>

523
00:41:36.937 --> 00:41:37.972
<i>we're gonna get in
for this?</i>

524
00:41:40.975 --> 00:41:43.811
What's she gonna do?
Kick us out?

525
00:41:45.479 --> 00:41:47.381
I don't wanna
be here anyway.

526
00:41:47.782 --> 00:41:49.016
Yeah.

527
00:41:49.049 --> 00:41:50.918
But as long as Dr. Phil
has her magic bubble...

528
00:41:50.951 --> 00:41:52.586
over the grounds...

529
00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.021
you don't have a choice.

530
00:41:54.822 --> 00:41:56.056
Yeah.

531
00:41:56.957 --> 00:41:59.293
I never did
have a choice.

532
00:42:00.528 --> 00:42:01.962
What do you mean?

533
00:42:06.801 --> 00:42:09.737
You know. I had to go and
work in the mines with my dad.

534
00:42:12.706 --> 00:42:15.075
I was still new
to the job.

535
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:17.344
And this one day.
I just...

536
00:42:19.914 --> 00:42:22.616
I just got
claustrophobic.

537
00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:25.452
Like I couldn't breathe.
It was...

538
00:42:26.086 --> 00:42:27.988
And he blasted.

539
00:42:29.824 --> 00:42:30.891
Yeah.

540
00:42:35.896 --> 00:42:37.631
I killed my dad.

541
00:42:40.167 --> 00:42:41.836
Most of his crew.

542
00:42:44.538 --> 00:42:47.575
I just... I just couldn't
forgive myself.

543
00:42:47.608 --> 00:42:49.543
I'm sorry. man.
I didn't...

544
00:42:49.577 --> 00:42:50.744
Just kept thinking...

545
00:42:52.513 --> 00:42:55.049
I would do anything
to change that.

546
00:43:01.155 --> 00:43:02.857
What about you?

547
00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:04.458
What did you do?

548
00:43:07.494 --> 00:43:08.662
Nothing.

549
00:43:28.449 --> 00:43:30.417
Wait. so you could get out
of the building...

550
00:43:30.451 --> 00:43:31.619
this whole time?

551
00:43:31.652 --> 00:43:33.153
I can get anywhere
in the hospital...

552
00:43:33.188 --> 00:43:34.555
through the vents.

553
00:43:34.588 --> 00:43:36.790
This is the only
way out. though.

554
00:43:36.824 --> 00:43:39.426
I'm always paranoid
Reyes is gonna find it.

555
00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.428
Yeah. she's gonna
find out a lot tomorrow.

556
00:43:41.462 --> 00:43:43.430
Trust me. This is worth it.

557
00:43:48.102 --> 00:43:49.603
Come on.
lay down.

558
00:44:04.785 --> 00:44:06.487
Oh. my God.

559
00:44:11.825 --> 00:44:13.560
Isn't that beautiful?

560
00:44:14.595 --> 00:44:15.829
Yeah.

561
00:44:16.563 --> 00:44:17.731
It is.

562
00:44:18.732 --> 00:44:20.567
It's our beautiful cage.

563
00:44:22.102 --> 00:44:24.505
That's what my father
called it.

564
00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.443
You had a dome
over your reservation?

565
00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.948
No.

566
00:44:36.617 --> 00:44:39.720
He meant our bodies.

567
00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:43.857
Like...

568
00:44:44.925 --> 00:44:47.228
how we're trapped in them.

569
00:44:48.162 --> 00:44:50.965
And at death.
our souls are free.

570
00:44:52.833 --> 00:44:55.203
Free to be
with the ones you love.

571
00:44:57.638 --> 00:44:59.707
Sounds pretty nice. honestly.

572
00:45:38.279 --> 00:45:40.781
Sorry. I thought
I heard you...

573
00:45:43.684 --> 00:45:45.019
Want company?

574
00:45:45.719 --> 00:45:47.322
Fine.

575
00:45:47.355 --> 00:45:50.591
But you have to turn off
the lights.

576
00:45:51.859 --> 00:45:52.993
Sure.

577
00:45:56.697 --> 00:45:58.098
Ooh. scary.

578
00:45:58.132 --> 00:45:59.633
Are you scared?

579
00:45:59.666 --> 00:46:00.768
No.

580
00:46:01.735 --> 00:46:03.271
I think you are.

581
00:46:04.305 --> 00:46:05.672
Virgin.

582
00:46:07.342 --> 00:46:08.909
You have to catch me.

583
00:46:09.676 --> 00:46:11.011
Hey. wait.

584
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.786
Doesn't feel
like it's real.

585
00:46:21.722 --> 00:46:24.691
Sometimes it doesn't feel
like you're real.

586
00:46:26.394 --> 00:46:28.162
What do you mean?

587
00:46:34.034 --> 00:46:35.769
It's just that...

588
00:46:37.372 --> 00:46:39.640
you're just so nice to me.

589
00:46:41.376 --> 00:46:43.710
Too nice.

590
00:46:43.744 --> 00:46:46.181
Sometimes I feel like
I made you up.

591
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.755
You didn't make me up.

592
00:46:54.788 --> 00:46:56.757
I promise you. I'm real.

593
00:47:18.213 --> 00:47:19.847
Your eyes.

594
00:47:20.914 --> 00:47:22.317
Oh.

595
00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:23.884
I'm sorry.

596
00:47:23.917 --> 00:47:25.119
Don't.

597
00:47:26.687 --> 00:47:28.189
They're beautiful.

598
00:47:32.693 --> 00:47:36.297
I've never
done this before.

599
00:47:36.864 --> 00:47:38.799
With a girl?

600
00:47:39.133 --> 00:47:40.801
With anyone.

601
00:48:00.188 --> 00:48:01.722
What's wrong?

602
00:48:06.427 --> 00:48:10.265
I can't. I just need
a second to cool down.

603
00:48:11.131 --> 00:48:12.866
Isn't this what you want?

604
00:48:13.934 --> 00:48:15.403
Yeah. It's...

605
00:48:16.937 --> 00:48:18.373
I can't get too hot.

606
00:48:19.507 --> 00:48:21.708
If I get too hot. I...

607
00:48:24.144 --> 00:48:25.879
You can tell me.

608
00:48:27.382 --> 00:48:29.317
I was with my girlfriend.

609
00:48:34.021 --> 00:48:35.323
I tried to hold her...

610
00:48:37.824 --> 00:48:40.395
but I burned her with my...

611
00:48:40.428 --> 00:48:43.063
- I killed her with my hands.
- Hey.

612
00:48:43.096 --> 00:48:44.731
- I burned her.
- Hey.

613
00:48:45.165 --> 00:48:46.700
Look at me.

614
00:48:48.969 --> 00:48:50.704
You can't burn me.

615
00:48:52.373 --> 00:48:54.209
You won't hurt me.

616
00:48:56.511 --> 00:48:57.811
But...

617
00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.715
you do need to
catch me again.

618
00:49:12.493 --> 00:49:13.760
<i>Illy?</i>

619
00:49:22.337 --> 00:49:23.504
Illy?

620
00:49:45.092 --> 00:49:46.860
Mariella! No!

621
00:49:57.871 --> 00:49:58.939
What is it?

622
00:49:59.474 --> 00:50:00.508
It's Berto.

623
00:50:10.184 --> 00:50:12.387
Control room. unlock.

624
00:50:20.093 --> 00:50:22.062
- What's going on?
- Go back to your room.

625
00:50:50.425 --> 00:50:53.227
Damn. What happened here?

626
00:50:57.298 --> 00:50:58.366
What?

627
00:50:59.367 --> 00:51:00.501
What's the code. huh?

628
00:51:00.535 --> 00:51:02.236
Give me my phone back.

629
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:03.937
I am in charge here.

630
00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:05.606
You're not in charge of shit.

631
00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.543
Did you not see what happened?
Huh? Illyana tried to kill me.

632
00:51:08.576 --> 00:51:10.077
It wasn't me.

633
00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:11.346
Roberto. Illyana was
in her room.

634
00:51:11.379 --> 00:51:12.213
Bullshit!

635
00:51:12.246 --> 00:51:14.915
There was nobody
in the pool but you.

636
00:51:14.948 --> 00:51:17.251
Did you see
what I saw? Huh?

637
00:51:17.285 --> 00:51:18.386
We're trapped in here
with demons...

638
00:51:18.419 --> 00:51:19.454
and you want us
to stay trapped!

639
00:51:19.487 --> 00:51:20.887
- Give it back.
- What's the code?

640
00:51:20.921 --> 00:51:22.557
- Hey! Berto. chill.
- Chill nothing.

641
00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:24.057
I'm calling the cops
and getting out of here.

642
00:51:24.091 --> 00:51:25.926
- You're not going anywhere.
- Yeah? Says who?

643
00:51:25.959 --> 00:51:26.993
Says your doctor.

644
00:51:27.027 --> 00:51:28.895
Bullshit.

645
00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:31.399
You're not a doctor.

646
00:51:33.668 --> 00:51:36.169
I've known men like you.

647
00:51:36.204 --> 00:51:38.506
Men who like to keep children
trapped in cages.

648
00:51:39.172 --> 00:51:41.242
I've known them...

649
00:51:41.275 --> 00:51:43.009
and I've killed them.

650
00:51:44.044 --> 00:51:46.180
She wasn't in the pool.

651
00:51:48.148 --> 00:51:50.618
But I know
what you did to me.

652
00:51:50.651 --> 00:51:53.920
You're gonna help the others
clean this mess.

653
00:51:53.954 --> 00:51:56.089
In your dreams.

654
00:51:59.694 --> 00:52:01.362
Let me out of here!

655
00:52:01.396 --> 00:52:03.331
Damn it!
I am not dying in here!

656
00:52:03.364 --> 00:52:04.532
Do you understand me?

657
00:52:04.565 --> 00:52:06.099
Let me out!

658
00:52:06.133 --> 00:52:07.502
Initiate lockdown.

659
00:52:14.275 --> 00:52:16.977
Today. Dani. we're
going to go a little deeper.

660
00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:18.212
Clench your fist.

661
00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:21.182
This will relax you.

662
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:37.998
I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

663
00:52:39.065 --> 00:52:41.402
I want you
to respond truthfully.

664
00:52:41.436 --> 00:52:43.304
What's the last thing
you remember...

665
00:52:43.337 --> 00:52:45.239
before coming here?

666
00:52:50.478 --> 00:52:52.313
My dad woke me up.

667
00:52:52.346 --> 00:52:54.147
He said we had to run.

668
00:52:55.316 --> 00:52:56.651
And everything was shaking.

669
00:52:56.684 --> 00:52:58.352
What were you
running from?

670
00:52:59.487 --> 00:53:01.389
He said it was a tornado.

671
00:53:01.422 --> 00:53:04.124
We both know
it wasn't a tornado. Dani.

672
00:53:04.157 --> 00:53:06.059
What were you
running from?

673
00:53:08.696 --> 00:53:10.498
It was snowing.

674
00:53:10.531 --> 00:53:11.666
In the summertime?

675
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.368
It brings the snow.

676
00:53:16.471 --> 00:53:17.672
What does?

677
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:24.110
The Demon Bear.

678
00:53:29.217 --> 00:53:30.384
Where are you?

679
00:53:30.418 --> 00:53:32.186
I'm right here. Dani.

680
00:53:35.289 --> 00:53:36.757
What is this place?

681
00:53:40.361 --> 00:53:41.429
What are you doing?

682
00:53:41.462 --> 00:53:42.463
Dani?

683
00:53:45.131 --> 00:53:47.033
No! No! No!

684
00:54:25.239 --> 00:54:26.474
Hello?

685
00:54:27.475 --> 00:54:30.278
Dani?
Who's there?

686
00:54:37.685 --> 00:54:39.220
You're not real.

687
00:54:40.254 --> 00:54:42.088
I killed you.

688
00:54:42.122 --> 00:54:46.427
And like Christ. I rise again.

689
00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.195
Stay away from me!

690
00:54:50.231 --> 00:54:52.233
Lockheed. what's going on?

691
00:54:55.636 --> 00:54:57.371
It's her.

692
00:54:58.472 --> 00:55:00.474
Focus. Dani!

693
00:55:00.508 --> 00:55:01.709
Can you control it?

694
00:55:03.411 --> 00:55:05.413
Nobody can.

695
00:55:21.429 --> 00:55:22.463
No!

696
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.221
Stay back!

697
00:55:55.229 --> 00:55:56.330
Rahne!

698
00:56:00.635 --> 00:56:01.936
Oh. my God.

699
00:56:01.969 --> 00:56:04.372
Is that real?
That's real.

700
00:56:04.405 --> 00:56:05.539
See. I told you.
This shit's real.

701
00:56:05.573 --> 00:56:07.173
What happened to her?

702
00:56:07.208 --> 00:56:08.743
You happened.

703
00:56:10.478 --> 00:56:11.579
It's Dani.

704
00:56:13.514 --> 00:56:15.316
It's all Dani.

705
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:16.484
I didn't do anything.

706
00:56:16.517 --> 00:56:18.252
You brought
this evil here!

707
00:56:20.254 --> 00:56:22.757
I now know your power.
new girl.

708
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:28.429
Let me show you mine.

709
00:56:28.462 --> 00:56:29.597
Illyana. no powers!

710
00:56:41.742 --> 00:56:42.977
Don't!

711
00:56:51.452 --> 00:56:53.521
She's in our heads.

712
00:56:53.554 --> 00:56:55.389
She'll kill us all.

713
00:57:34.962 --> 00:57:38.499
Something's happening
to me. and I can't control it.

714
00:57:45.473 --> 00:57:47.308
That place you took me...

715
00:57:50.377 --> 00:57:51.579
Was it hell?

716
00:57:56.083 --> 00:57:59.420
Limbo. It's a place
we made up.

717
00:57:59.987 --> 00:58:01.288
"We"?

718
00:58:02.056 --> 00:58:03.591
Me and Lockheed.

719
00:58:10.064 --> 00:58:11.966
I brought someone
for you.

720
00:58:30.518 --> 00:58:33.454
At first. it was just
our special place.

721
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:36.891
We went there
in our minds...

722
00:58:36.924 --> 00:58:39.493
whenever something bad
was about to happen.

723
00:58:43.664 --> 00:58:45.666
But we went there
so much...

724
00:58:48.002 --> 00:58:49.937
stayed there so long...

725
00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:54.074
it became real.

726
00:58:54.108 --> 00:58:55.142
I saw a memory.

727
00:58:59.013 --> 00:59:00.848
It wasn't mine.

728
00:59:05.653 --> 00:59:07.688
Who were they?

729
00:59:07.721 --> 00:59:09.824
I never knew
their names.

730
00:59:09.857 --> 00:59:11.725
They were all the same.

731
00:59:15.663 --> 00:59:17.665
They made us cry.

732
00:59:23.804 --> 00:59:25.973
And it made them smile.

733
01:00:19.493 --> 01:00:20.694
How's the pain?

734
01:00:20.728 --> 01:00:22.429
Drugs are helping.

735
01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:25.532
Was it really him?

736
01:00:25.566 --> 01:00:26.967
Preacher?

737
01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:29.670
If he wasn't real.
he could've fooled me.

738
01:00:34.209 --> 01:00:35.776
Why won't you come in?

739
01:00:38.746 --> 01:00:40.614
I'm not afraid of you.

740
01:00:44.785 --> 01:00:46.620
I'm afraid
of what I saw.

741
01:00:46.654 --> 01:00:47.922
Of him.

742
01:00:51.992 --> 01:00:54.195
But what if he only came
because of me?

743
01:00:57.498 --> 01:01:00.801
Even if you are the one
making these things happen...

744
01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:05.072
you had no choice.

745
01:01:05.105 --> 01:01:06.941
It's not your fault.

746
01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:12.947
I saw something when
Dr. Reyes was testing me.

747
01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.516
I saw kids like us.

748
01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:18.719
Mutants. being forced
to do things.

749
01:01:21.189 --> 01:01:22.723
Horrible things.

750
01:01:27.962 --> 01:01:31.165
I don't
think this is a hospital.

751
01:01:31.199 --> 01:01:33.834
The place that I saw.
I think that's where we go...

752
01:01:33.867 --> 01:01:35.703
when we leave.

753
01:01:37.071 --> 01:01:39.207
If we leave.

754
01:01:41.075 --> 01:01:42.676
I'm ready for you. Dani.

755
01:01:45.679 --> 01:01:46.680
- Wait.
- I have to go.

756
01:01:47.614 --> 01:01:48.716
What if you're right?

757
01:01:48.749 --> 01:01:51.018
Are you just gonna let her
pump you full of drugs again?

758
01:01:51.051 --> 01:01:54.088
Last time.
I saw things. secrets.

759
01:01:55.756 --> 01:01:57.725
Maybe I will again.

760
01:01:57.758 --> 01:01:59.994
Maybe those secrets will help
us find a way out of here.

761
01:02:00.027 --> 01:02:01.528
How?

762
01:02:01.562 --> 01:02:03.063
I don't know yet.

763
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.101
But let's live a bit longer.
Rahne Sinclair.

764
01:02:24.018 --> 01:02:25.853
Dani wanted me
to stay with her.

765
01:02:25.886 --> 01:02:27.222
I need you to
wait outside. Rahne.

766
01:02:27.255 --> 01:02:28.256
I know. but...

767
01:02:28.289 --> 01:02:29.857
You can
come back for recovery.

768
01:02:38.866 --> 01:02:40.901
Doors. Hallway H.

769
01:03:07.661 --> 01:03:09.230
Hey.
What's up with you?

770
01:03:10.298 --> 01:03:11.732
Nothing.

771
01:03:13.901 --> 01:03:15.069
It's just...

772
01:03:16.136 --> 01:03:18.072
Well. Reyes was...

773
01:03:19.907 --> 01:03:21.675
Reyes was what?

774
01:03:24.812 --> 01:03:25.846
You guys hear that?

775
01:03:30.084 --> 01:03:31.652
Is that music?

776
01:03:37.825 --> 01:03:39.360
I know that song.

777
01:03:41.929 --> 01:03:42.930
Wait.

778
01:03:45.266 --> 01:03:47.668
What are we testing
this time?

779
01:03:48.436 --> 01:03:50.871
This is more a test of me.

780
01:03:54.108 --> 01:03:57.177
I told you
my mother was a vet. right?

781
01:03:57.212 --> 01:03:59.214
One day
our family dog went feral...

782
01:04:01.148 --> 01:04:03.050
mauled the neighbor's boy.

783
01:04:03.684 --> 01:04:04.952
Lift your head.

784
01:04:06.187 --> 01:04:07.188
Down.

785
01:04:10.757 --> 01:04:12.092
It was rabies.

786
01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:16.964
It's coming
from my room.

787
01:04:21.469 --> 01:04:22.970
I'm going
to get Dr. Reyes.

788
01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:26.874
Illyana. don't!

789
01:04:33.448 --> 01:04:36.384
What the hell
is this place?

790
01:04:37.985 --> 01:04:39.019
No.

791
01:04:40.255 --> 01:04:41.755
No. I buried this.

792
01:04:52.433 --> 01:04:54.402
Stay away from her.
you pig!

793
01:04:57.938 --> 01:05:00.707
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

794
01:05:00.741 --> 01:05:02.109
Look. Look at me.

795
01:05:02.142 --> 01:05:04.077
Listen to me.
He cannot hurt you.

796
01:05:04.111 --> 01:05:05.846
No! Don't!

797
01:05:07.014 --> 01:05:09.783
Look. see? He's not real.
All right?

798
01:05:12.953 --> 01:05:14.021
Go! Run!

799
01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:17.225
Run!

800
01:05:17.258 --> 01:05:19.427
My mother
tried everything.

801
01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.296
It was too far along.

802
01:05:22.996 --> 01:05:24.798
I can't tell you
how hard it is...

803
01:05:24.831 --> 01:05:27.000
for a doctor
to face that. Dani.

804
01:05:30.804 --> 01:05:32.139
That powerlessness.

805
01:05:37.412 --> 01:05:40.047
You can do your best
to save a patient...

806
01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:43.218
but sometimes
the most humane thing to do...

807
01:05:43.251 --> 01:05:45.085
is put it to sleep.

808
01:05:46.887 --> 01:05:48.289
Help!

809
01:05:48.956 --> 01:05:50.724
Help!

810
01:05:51.792 --> 01:05:53.328
Help!

811
01:05:57.164 --> 01:05:58.832
Help me!

812
01:06:03.571 --> 01:06:05.772
Help me!

813
01:06:10.411 --> 01:06:12.012
All right. It's okay.

814
01:06:13.548 --> 01:06:14.881
Oh. Jesus!

815
01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:17.918
Get away! Stop!

816
01:06:19.019 --> 01:06:21.788
Get off me! Let me go!

817
01:06:21.822 --> 01:06:23.224
No! Stop!

818
01:06:24.891 --> 01:06:27.127
Stop! Stop! Stop!

819
01:06:58.626 --> 01:07:00.295
You're
the most powerful mutant...

820
01:07:00.328 --> 01:07:01.928
we've ever had.

821
01:07:01.962 --> 01:07:05.533
But my superiors believe your
powers cannot be controlled.

822
01:07:07.468 --> 01:07:09.270
It's almost over. Dani.

823
01:07:36.264 --> 01:07:37.265
Dani?

824
01:07:42.503 --> 01:07:43.504
Dani?

825
01:07:45.473 --> 01:07:46.907
Dani. wake up.

826
01:07:56.417 --> 01:07:57.951
Hey. Dr. Reyes!

827
01:07:57.984 --> 01:07:59.554
Thank God.
You gotta help us!

828
01:08:00.488 --> 01:08:02.122
Hey!

829
01:08:02.155 --> 01:08:03.391
Dr. Reyes!

830
01:08:13.967 --> 01:08:16.069
I love you. Lockheed.
We're gonna die.

831
01:08:17.271 --> 01:08:18.972
Come on. Illyana.
You gotta do something.

832
01:08:19.005 --> 01:08:20.641
- I can't.
- Use your powers.

833
01:08:20.675 --> 01:08:22.142
I can't!

834
01:08:22.175 --> 01:08:24.479
Illyana. do something!

835
01:08:27.715 --> 01:08:29.650
Oh. seriously?

836
01:08:48.369 --> 01:08:50.571
Hey. Berto! Berto!

837
01:08:53.741 --> 01:08:55.710
Bitch put force fields
over all the exits.

838
01:08:55.743 --> 01:08:57.645
Is she trying
to kill us?

839
01:08:57.678 --> 01:08:59.146
Don't know. Did she make
those smiley things?

840
01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.947
No. They're Illyana's.

841
01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:02.082
Of course they are.

842
01:09:02.115 --> 01:09:03.384
Have you seen the girls?

843
01:09:03.418 --> 01:09:04.452
No.

844
01:09:04.485 --> 01:09:06.287
All right. Upstairs.

845
01:09:22.303 --> 01:09:24.171
Where the hell
did you go?

846
01:09:26.741 --> 01:09:28.609
Our special place.

847
01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:32.480
That was so hot.

848
01:09:46.761 --> 01:09:49.397
What the hell's going on?
Where's Dr. Reyes?

849
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:50.765
She tried
to kill Dani.

850
01:09:50.798 --> 01:09:52.032
What?

851
01:09:52.065 --> 01:09:54.268
That test?
It wasn't a test.

852
01:09:54.302 --> 01:09:56.270
She tried to kill her.

853
01:09:56.304 --> 01:09:57.605
My file.

854
01:09:59.105 --> 01:10:01.776
"Patient reviles authority.

855
01:10:01.809 --> 01:10:04.345
"But her fragmented psyche
and base hatred for humans...

856
01:10:04.378 --> 01:10:06.514
"makes her a prime

857
01:10:07.582 --> 01:10:08.982
"Conclusion...

"Recommend

861
01:10:24.799 --> 01:10:26.734
Essex Corporation.

862
01:10:26.767 --> 01:10:28.703
That must have been
the place I saw.

863
01:10:28.736 --> 01:10:31.305
She wasn't
prepping us to be X-Men.

864
01:10:31.339 --> 01:10:32.773
She was prepping us
to be killers.

865
01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:35.643
We don't have much time.

866
01:10:35.676 --> 01:10:37.445
Reyes wants me dead.
And it won't be long...

867
01:10:37.478 --> 01:10:39.447
before she comes back
to finish the job.

868
01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.617
How? This place is designed
to keep us inside.

869
01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:45.051
All our powers. it won't work.
It's hopeless.

870
01:10:45.085 --> 01:10:47.321
No. It isn't.

871
01:10:47.355 --> 01:10:49.724
We got each other
out of our cages.

872
01:10:51.459 --> 01:10:52.693
We can get out of this.

873
01:10:52.727 --> 01:10:54.428
That's all
well and good.

874
01:10:54.462 --> 01:10:55.730
But she's still got
force fields...

875
01:10:55.763 --> 01:10:57.163
around the building.

876
01:10:57.832 --> 01:11:01.235
The windows. everything.

877
01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:04.104
How you gonna
get past that?

878
01:11:05.339 --> 01:11:07.308
By taking out the source.

879
01:11:10.143 --> 01:11:12.145
Then let's kill the bitch.

880
01:11:20.555 --> 01:11:21.556
<i>Tonight...</i>

881
01:11:21.589 --> 01:11:24.759
<i>I'd like to talk
about responsibility.</i>

882
01:11:25.993 --> 01:11:29.664
<i>You have a responsibility
to your treatment.</i>

883
01:11:29.697 --> 01:11:32.400
<i>I want all of you to go
to your rooms right now.</i>

884
01:11:32.433 --> 01:11:36.804
<i>If you disobey.
or if you try to leave this facility...</i>

885
01:11:36.837 --> 01:11:39.473
<i>I have a responsibility
to stop you.</i>

886
01:11:40.441 --> 01:11:42.443
<i>No matter what it takes.</i>

887
01:11:45.913 --> 01:11:48.249
How do you know
she's still in here?

888
01:11:48.749 --> 01:11:50.618
I'm a good smeller.

889
01:11:50.651 --> 01:11:52.653
<i>You're a good killer.</i>

890
01:11:52.687 --> 01:11:54.221
What's going on?

891
01:11:55.356 --> 01:11:57.358
What's Essex Corp?

892
01:12:05.766 --> 01:12:10.605
It's a scientific organization
founded by my superiors.

893
01:12:10.638 --> 01:12:13.808
Founded to do what?
Screw with our heads?

894
01:12:13.841 --> 01:12:14.842
To save you!

895
01:12:17.778 --> 01:12:19.313
If it wasn't for me...

896
01:12:19.347 --> 01:12:21.682
you all would've been dead
a long time ago!

897
01:12:23.317 --> 01:12:24.719
It's okay. Hey.

898
01:12:25.886 --> 01:12:27.254
Calm down.

899
01:12:27.288 --> 01:12:28.289
Like I said...

900
01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:31.258
I want all of you
to calm down.

901
01:12:32.393 --> 01:12:35.796
All right?
Promise to do that.

902
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:37.531
And I'll let you go.

903
01:12:38.299 --> 01:12:39.634
Except Dani.

904
01:12:40.701 --> 01:12:42.837
Dani needs to be put down.

905
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:45.439
- No!
- Let us out! Let us out!

906
01:12:45.473 --> 01:12:46.507
It's okay.

907
01:12:47.408 --> 01:12:48.542
It's for her own good.

908
01:12:50.478 --> 01:12:52.178
And yours.

909
01:12:53.848 --> 01:12:56.417
I'm sure you've figured out
her power by now.

910
01:12:56.817 --> 01:12:58.486
So special.

911
01:13:01.956 --> 01:13:04.425
She takes
your greatest fear...

912
01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:06.494
your darkest secret...

913
01:13:07.561 --> 01:13:09.497
and makes you
live through it.

914
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:10.798
No!

915
01:13:10.831 --> 01:13:13.367
Over and over.

916
01:13:14.835 --> 01:13:17.972
Over and over.

917
01:13:18.005 --> 01:13:19.240
Until it kills you.

918
01:13:22.576 --> 01:13:24.245
That's it.

919
01:13:24.278 --> 01:13:25.846
That's it. Breathe.

920
01:13:31.686 --> 01:13:32.887
That's it.

921
01:13:38.392 --> 01:13:41.362
You're about to see
your father again.

922
01:13:41.395 --> 01:13:43.330
In the spirit world.

923
01:14:05.519 --> 01:14:06.787
What are you doing. Dani?

924
01:14:27.875 --> 01:14:28.943
Dani.

925
01:14:28.976 --> 01:14:30.745
Guys. she won't wake up.

926
01:14:30.778 --> 01:14:31.979
Help me.

927
01:14:32.012 --> 01:14:33.514
- Hey! Wake up!
- Dani!

928
01:14:34.849 --> 01:14:37.485
<i>Dani! Guys! Dani.</i>

929
01:14:40.554 --> 01:14:41.689
<i>It's coming back!</i>

930
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:51.699
It's hunting us.

931
01:14:51.732 --> 01:14:53.834
No. It's hunting Dani.

932
01:14:54.435 --> 01:14:55.736
Why Dani?

933
01:14:56.737 --> 01:14:59.073
Because that's what
she fears.

934
01:14:59.106 --> 01:15:01.509
Come on. Help me.

935
01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:04.078
All right.
One. two. three.

936
01:15:13.954 --> 01:15:16.090
Take Dani
to a safe place...

937
01:15:16.123 --> 01:15:17.725
and I'll take care
of this bear.

938
01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.701
What are you going to do?

939
01:15:27.735 --> 01:15:29.670
I'm going to
play with it.

940
01:15:30.871 --> 01:15:32.573
Get her out of here.

941
01:15:42.516 --> 01:15:44.885
Are you crazy?
That thing'll kill you!

942
01:15:44.919 --> 01:15:46.654
He's right.
It's magic.

943
01:15:49.857 --> 01:15:51.625
So am I.

944
01:15:51.659 --> 01:15:52.660
No! Illy!

945
01:15:59.767 --> 01:16:01.569
Hey. Yogi!

946
01:16:03.904 --> 01:16:07.041
Lions and tigers
and bears. Oh. my.

947
01:16:08.175 --> 01:16:10.544
Right. Lockheed?

948
01:16:26.961 --> 01:16:27.995
Holy shit!

949
01:16:28.028 --> 01:16:29.563
I'm gonna
marry that girl.

950
01:16:30.731 --> 01:16:32.132
You okay. Lockheed?

951
01:16:38.505 --> 01:16:40.708
Come on!
Let's go. Let's go.

952
01:16:40.741 --> 01:16:43.010
Berto. you have to run
with her.

953
01:16:43.043 --> 01:16:44.411
I can't. I'm not ready.

954
01:16:44.445 --> 01:16:45.980
You won't hurt her.
You can do this.

955
01:16:48.682 --> 01:16:49.750
Come on! This way.

956
01:17:03.097 --> 01:17:05.799
You guys go.
I'm going back for Illy.

957
01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:06.967
Sam!

958
01:17:09.503 --> 01:17:11.138
Gotta get better someday.

959
01:17:12.139 --> 01:17:13.507
Give her to me.

960
01:17:14.074 --> 01:17:15.175
Hide.

961
01:17:17.144 --> 01:17:19.947
Demons can't come in churches.
Demons can't come in churches.

962
01:17:24.652 --> 01:17:28.455
Dani. I really need you
to wake up.

963
01:17:28.489 --> 01:17:30.225
Come back.
you coward!

964
01:17:30.258 --> 01:17:31.792
<i>Hail Mary.
full of grace...</i>

965
01:17:31.825 --> 01:17:33.661
<i>blessed art thou
amongst women.</i>

966
01:17:33.694 --> 01:17:35.863
Pray for us sinners now
and in the hour of our death.

967
01:17:35.896 --> 01:17:37.831
Amen.

968
01:17:45.873 --> 01:17:47.608
Aah! No!

969
01:18:16.804 --> 01:18:17.905
Ahh!

970
01:18:32.619 --> 01:18:33.821
Demon Bear!

971
01:18:36.056 --> 01:18:38.226
Nowhere to run now.

972
01:18:40.995 --> 01:18:42.563
I know you're in there.

973
01:18:43.931 --> 01:18:46.967
Please. You're not alone.
I'm here.

974
01:18:47.001 --> 01:18:48.535
We're all here...

975
01:18:48.569 --> 01:18:50.571
<i>fighting for you.</i>

976
01:18:50.604 --> 01:18:52.072
Rahne. where are you?

977
01:18:54.641 --> 01:18:55.809
Rahne!

978
01:18:57.077 --> 01:19:00.014
Dani. I know
you can hear me in there.

979
01:19:02.049 --> 01:19:03.550
What are you doing?

980
01:19:03.584 --> 01:19:05.152
I'm hiding. the same thing
you're doing.

981
01:19:15.996 --> 01:19:17.031
Watch out!

982
01:19:26.207 --> 01:19:27.208
Lockheed!

983
01:19:33.814 --> 01:19:34.915
Berto!

984
01:19:34.948 --> 01:19:36.284
Nut up!

985
01:20:04.111 --> 01:20:05.112
Rahne!

986
01:20:11.919 --> 01:20:13.254
<i>You have to wake up...</i>

987
01:20:13.288 --> 01:20:15.856
or we're all going to die.

988
01:20:20.994 --> 01:20:22.029
Berto!

989
01:20:25.266 --> 01:20:27.134
No! Berto!

990
01:20:29.703 --> 01:20:31.638
Only you can stop this.

991
01:20:36.311 --> 01:20:37.811
I can't.

992
01:20:59.933 --> 01:21:00.934
Dani!

993
01:21:10.177 --> 01:21:11.279
Dad!

994
01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.748
I'm so sorry.

995
01:21:17.485 --> 01:21:19.786
It wasn't your fault.

996
01:21:21.155 --> 01:21:23.458
But now you need
to wake up.

997
01:21:23.491 --> 01:21:26.394
But the bear.
it's too big.

998
01:21:28.028 --> 01:21:29.796
You're bigger.

999
01:21:40.908 --> 01:21:42.443
<i>Dani!</i>

1000
01:21:44.778 --> 01:21:46.980
No! Dani! Help!

1001
01:21:49.883 --> 01:21:51.051
<i>Dani!</i>

1002
01:21:54.755 --> 01:21:55.756
No!

1003
01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:58.326
Dani!

1004
01:21:59.026 --> 01:22:00.727
Stop.

1005
01:22:13.341 --> 01:22:15.042
No.

1006
01:22:23.116 --> 01:22:24.151
No.

1007
01:22:26.354 --> 01:22:28.289
I'm in charge now.

1008
01:22:30.157 --> 01:22:31.526
Control.

1009
01:22:41.336 --> 01:22:42.403
Good.

1010
01:23:18.005 --> 01:23:20.241
Everything is gonna be okay.

1011
01:23:24.379 --> 01:23:26.980
You don't have to worry
about anything anymore.

1012
01:23:31.051 --> 01:23:33.820
But it's time
to go to sleep now.

1013
01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:18.259
Thank you.

1014
01:25:18.292 --> 01:25:19.627
Thanks. all of you.

1015
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:22.630
For saving me.

1016
01:25:23.664 --> 01:25:24.665
Are you kidding?

1017
01:25:27.502 --> 01:25:29.002
You saved us.

1018
01:25:47.053 --> 01:25:50.991
Hey. guys. The dome's gone.

1019
01:25:51.459 --> 01:25:53.494
So we're free?

1020
01:25:53.528 --> 01:25:54.995
Reyes always said
the nearest town...

1021
01:25:55.028 --> 01:25:56.464
is 20 miles away.

1022
01:25:57.532 --> 01:25:59.200
She could be lying.

1023
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:04.672
Shall we find out?

1024
01:26:16.217 --> 01:26:17.618
<i>My father
used to tell me that...</i>

1025
01:26:17.652 --> 01:26:20.354
<i>inside every person.
there are two bears.</i>

1026
01:26:22.423 --> 01:26:24.492
<i>One bear is all things good.</i>

1027
01:26:24.525 --> 01:26:28.396
<i>Compassion. love. trust.</i>

1028
01:26:28.429 --> 01:26:30.997
<i>The other is all things evil.</i>

1029
01:26:31.031 --> 01:26:35.001
<i>Fear. shame.
and self-destruction.</i>

1030
01:26:35.670 --> 01:26:38.439
<i>I asked him. "Which one wins?"</i>

1031
01:26:39.774 --> 01:26:43.311
<i>He answered.
"The one you feed."</i>
