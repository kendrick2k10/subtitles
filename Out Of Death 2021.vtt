-

4
00:00:52.713 --> 00:00:53.712
On your knees.

5
00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:56.451
Now. goddamn it!

6
00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:57.314
away from home

7
00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:23.373
make it through

8
00:02:30.378 --> 00:02:32.613
Wow. this place looks amazing.

9
00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:35.880
Yeah. it is. right?

10
00:02:37.455 --> 00:02:39.719
My dad used to spend a lot of
time here as a kid.

11
00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:44.328
I'd love to join you. but
I have a serious allergy

12
00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:45.857
to anything that involves bugs.

13
00:02:45.892 --> 00:02:47.496
Yes. I know.

14
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:49.234
I get it.

15
00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.763
It's okay.

16
00:02:50.798 --> 00:02:52.369
This is something I need
to do on my own.

17
00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:55.207
Thanks for driving.

18
00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:56.472
Anytime.

19
00:03:01.044 --> 00:03:02.709
If you don't hear from me
in a few hours.

20
00:03:02.744 --> 00:03:04.282
call search and rescue. okay?

21
00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:05.943
- Seriously?
- No. I'm kidding.

22
00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:08.583
I'll call you
on the way back down.

23
00:03:08.618 --> 00:03:09.848
We'll make it to
Atlanta tonight.

24
00:03:09.883 --> 00:03:11.586
Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

25
00:04:09.613 --> 00:04:13.945
-

26
00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:47.682
-

27
00:05:12.775 --> 00:05:15.842
Dear Dad. I did it.

28
00:05:15.877 --> 00:05:18.944
I made it up the trail.
Almost at the top.

29
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.453
I took some great photos to
remember this place by.

30
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.918
I was gonna write this letter
and leave it up here with you.

31
00:05:26.487 --> 00:05:29.691
but now there's a thunderstorm
and something just feels...

32
00:05:30.155 --> 00:05:31.363
feels off.

33
00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.091
I don't know if I can
do this now.

34
00:05:34.927 --> 00:05:37.765
I'm not quitting or anything.
I promise.

35
00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:41.065
I'm just not sure I'm truly
ready to say goodbye.

36
00:05:42.937 --> 00:05:43.969
Maybe the storm is a sign

37
00:05:44.004 --> 00:05:45.773
I should come back
another day?

38
00:05:46.875 --> 00:05:48.644
I wish you could
talk to me now.

39
00:05:49.746 --> 00:05:50.745
Guess it's up to me.

40
00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:36.626
Welcome back.

41
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.961
-

42
00:07:51.098 --> 00:07:56.541
all suffering

43
00:08:11.085 --> 00:08:18.090
guiding me home

44
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.732
You waitin' for somebody?

45
00:08:27.134 --> 00:08:28.540
Get in.

46
00:08:51.059 --> 00:08:52.058
All right!

47
00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:54.192
Business first.

48
00:08:54.694 --> 00:08:56.733
You know I just can't
control myself

49
00:08:56.768 --> 00:08:58.130
when you're in that uniform.

50
00:09:04.006 --> 00:09:05.808
All right. Jimmy!

51
00:09:08.142 --> 00:09:09.141
What do you got for me?

52
00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:23.925
You're four stacks short.

53
00:09:27.898 --> 00:09:29.194
It was a tough month.

54
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:35.134
Don't worry. I still got
your little side cut in full.

55
00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:38.676
- Right here.
- Get the fuck back.

56
00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:41.272
You know I can't go back to Hank
four stacks short!

57
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.650
It is what it is.

58
00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:47.883
You need to be able
to move this.

59
00:09:48.218 --> 00:09:50.116
I'm tryin'. It ain't easy.

60
00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:52.118
Or should I just stop seizin'
it for you?

61
00:09:52.153 --> 00:09:53.286
Baby. you know the deal.

62
00:09:53.321 --> 00:09:56.793
We guarantee the product and
you guarantee the distro.

63
00:09:56.828 --> 00:09:57.827
I know.

64
00:09:58.629 --> 00:10:00.192
I'll get you more
money next week.

65
00:10:03.164 --> 00:10:05.967
Now. how much stuff can you get
for me this month. baby?

66
00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:07.705
Come on.

67
00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.675
Get your fuckin'
hand off my leg.

68
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.336
Come on. baby.
-  I'm over this shit!

69
00:10:12.371 --> 00:10:14.976
Read the room. Jimmy.
Ya fucked up.

70
00:10:15.244 --> 00:10:16.681
Hand me a brick.

71
00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:18.111
You serious?

72
00:10:18.146 --> 00:10:20.685
Wanna play it that way? Fine.

73
00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:38.835
Hold that.

74
00:10:46.042 --> 00:10:47.074
Bag that up for me.

75
00:10:48.407 --> 00:10:49.406
It's not right.

76
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.082
Looks like I'm gonna need to
find myself a new partner

77
00:10:55.117 --> 00:10:56.281
and I'm gonna need samples.

78
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.055
What are we talkin' here?

79
00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:02.793
Just the coke?

80
00:11:04.863 --> 00:11:06.390
Or the meth and the heroin. too?

81
00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:08.733
Details?

82
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:12.033
Details? Are you fuckin'
serious?

83
00:11:12.435 --> 00:11:13.771
What the fuck is wrong
with you today?

84
00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:15.036
That's not how we talk.

85
00:11:15.071 --> 00:11:16.400
That's not what we do.

86
00:11:21.506 --> 00:11:23.440
Cell phones off when we meet!

87
00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:24.881
You know the protocol!

88
00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:28.280
What the fuck?

89
00:11:30.251 --> 00:11:32.317
You fuckin' recordin' me. Jimmy?

90
00:12:33.512 --> 00:12:35.952
Fuck!

91
00:13:22.495 --> 00:13:24.528
The old cabin looks good.

92
00:13:25.465 --> 00:13:26.871
It's seen some changes.

93
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.874
Daddy's always fixin'
this or that.

94
00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:31.535
He'll be back in a month and...

95
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.010
he's lookin' forward to seein'
his big brother.

96
00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:35.176
How's dispatch?

97
00:13:35.511 --> 00:13:37.915
Excitin' as usual.

98
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.543
Got a call about a nasty
possum the other day.

99
00:13:39.578 --> 00:13:41.347
You know. important
stuff like that.

100
00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:44.284
How you doin'. Uncle Jack?

101
00:13:46.123 --> 00:13:48.024
It's okay if you don't
wanna talk about it.

102
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.554
It's only been
three weeks and...

103
00:13:51.223 --> 00:13:52.963
it's only natural to
feel like that.

104
00:13:59.202 --> 00:14:00.465
32 years.

105
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:04.601
Feels like it's yesterday.

106
00:14:06.572 --> 00:14:07.945
She was an amazing woman.

107
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.445
I feel your loss.

108
00:14:13.847 --> 00:14:16.085
It'll take some gettin'
used to for sure.

109
00:14:16.582 --> 00:14:17.581
Yeah.

110
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.552
Don't worry. the country'll
be good for you.

111
00:14:22.388 --> 00:14:25.424
This lake? It has a way of
healin' things.

112
00:14:32.565 --> 00:14:33.564
Uncle Jack!

113
00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:36.567
Hey. sport. How you doin'?

114
00:14:36.602 --> 00:14:38.503
- Good.
- Nice to see you.

115
00:14:39.038 --> 00:14:40.978
Gettin' bigger by the minute.

116
00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:42.474
You look kinda sad.

117
00:14:45.512 --> 00:14:46.918
I have something for you.

118
00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:50.581
A new video game.

119
00:14:50.616 --> 00:14:51.989
- That's for you.
- Awesome!

120
00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:53.419
Thanks. Uncle Jack.

121
00:14:59.559 --> 00:15:03.330
What's a city guy like me
supposed to do around here?

122
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:05.629
You hear that?

123
00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:10.139
Exactly. Nothin'.

124
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.175
It's just peace and quiet.

125
00:15:13.544 --> 00:15:14.539
Enjoy it.

126
00:15:15.542 --> 00:15:17.608
Go fishin'. take a hike.

127
00:15:19.183 --> 00:15:20.644
Just get some fresh air in ya.

128
00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:24.989
Yes. A hike.

129
00:15:25.024 --> 00:15:26.254
Just don't take your cell phone.

130
00:15:26.289 --> 00:15:27.618
It'll distract you.

131
00:15:27.653 --> 00:15:29.389
Reception's spotty anyway.

132
00:15:35.463 --> 00:15:36.627
You might want that. though.

133
00:15:39.764 --> 00:15:40.972
Bears.

134
00:15:42.206 --> 00:15:44.074
- Bears?
- Just in case.

135
00:16:20.409 --> 00:16:21.573
Who's there?

136
00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:28.118
Hey!

137
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:32.188
- Hey!
-

138
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.455
Stop runnin' and
come back here now!

139
00:16:44.763 --> 00:16:46.268
You have the Sheriff's Office.

140
00:16:46.303 --> 00:16:47.269
We got a problem.

141
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.703
Then I said. "That might be
a little dangerous."

142
00:16:53.272 --> 00:16:57.015
Then she said. "I'm not talkin'
about your pistol.

143
00:16:57.217 --> 00:16:58.676
I'm talkin' about your piece."

144
00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:05.485
- True story. True story.
- Hank. Hank.

145
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.586
- Yeah?
- You're gonna wanna take this.

146
00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:08.785
It's Billie.

147
00:17:16.696 --> 00:17:17.695
Doesn't sound good.

148
00:17:19.666 --> 00:17:21.699
She might be cryin'.
I don't know.

149
00:17:21.734 --> 00:17:23.767
- Line one?
- Mm-hmm.

150
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.569
Billie. talk.

151
00:17:25.604 --> 00:17:27.606
I had to let go
of an asset today.

152
00:17:29.379 --> 00:17:30.840
Come again. Billie?

153
00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:32.809
And we have an unintended.

154
00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:33.910
Oh God!

155
00:17:33.945 --> 00:17:36.120
Anyone else see you out there?

156
00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:37.451
No. sir.

157
00:17:37.486 --> 00:17:38.650
Are you sure?

158
00:17:38.685 --> 00:17:39.684
Yeah. I'm sure!

159
00:17:40.219 --> 00:17:43.325
And. uh. where is the asset?

160
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.162
Secure. Under the car.

161
00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:47.824
Whose car?

162
00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:49.166
The asset's car. y'all.

163
00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:50.299
I'm not an idiot.

164
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.830
He sure as hell ain't
under my car.

165
00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:55.799
Jesus. Billie. watch your words.

166
00:17:56.001 --> 00:17:57.735
Will you relax. Tommy?

167
00:17:58.637 --> 00:18:00.738
It's contained. I pulled the car
off the shoulder.

168
00:18:00.773 --> 00:18:01.772
It's behind a bush.

169
00:18:02.508 --> 00:18:04.214
It's not visible
from the road.

170
00:18:04.716 --> 00:18:06.447
Any word on the unintended?

171
00:18:06.782 --> 00:18:08.614
No. she took off runnin'
like a bull

172
00:18:08.649 --> 00:18:09.780
with its balls cut off.

173
00:18:09.815 --> 00:18:10.880
I don't know where
the fuck she went.

174
00:18:10.915 --> 00:18:12.288
Whoa. She?

175
00:18:13.357 --> 00:18:15.357
What the...

176
00:18:15.659 --> 00:18:16.491
It was a woman. no question.

177
00:18:16.593 --> 00:18:19.196
Okay. All right. look.
I know that area.

178
00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:20.725
There's only three
obvious exit points

179
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.298
she might try to get to.

180
00:18:23.433 --> 00:18:24.762
You just close one of 'em off.

181
00:18:25.464 --> 00:18:27.699
- Tommy. get movin'.
- Yeah. copy that.

182
00:18:27.734 --> 00:18:28.799
All right.

183
00:18:28.834 --> 00:18:30.306
Billie. stay on her.

184
00:18:30.341 --> 00:18:31.670
Tommy's leavin' right now.

185
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.510
All right. I'm on my way out.

186
00:18:36.545 --> 00:18:38.182
All right.
Oh. wait. Tommy.

187
00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:39.381
- What?
- Take a couple posters

188
00:18:39.416 --> 00:18:40.514
out there with you. too.

189
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:41.845
One more thing. Billie.

190
00:18:42.314 --> 00:18:43.517
Yeah?

191
00:18:48.755 --> 00:18:51.657
No more unintendeds. Understand?

192
00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:03.372
- Fuck!
-

193
00:20:51.845 --> 00:20:52.844
Shit.

194
00:21:03.087 --> 00:21:04.823
Jesus. Jimmy. what'd you do?

195
00:21:12.602 --> 00:21:16.703
Look at this shit.

196
00:21:34.921 --> 00:21:37.394
- Talk to me.
- Yeah. it's like she described.

197
00:21:37.829 --> 00:21:39.594
Out of view?
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:21:39.629 --> 00:21:40.695
A mess?

199
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.697
Eh. a little bit. Not too bad.

200
00:21:45.602 --> 00:21:48.064
Okay. recover the goods

201
00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:49.769
and then see if you can
flush out the girl.

202
00:21:50.171 --> 00:21:51.738
All right. copy that.

203
00:21:51.773 --> 00:21:53.003
Tommy.

204
00:21:53.038 --> 00:21:53.937
Yeah. Hank?

205
00:21:53.973 --> 00:21:55.676
I want you takin'
the lead on this one.

206
00:21:56.245 --> 00:21:59.042
Billie's been a bit
shaky lately.

207
00:21:59.377 --> 00:22:01.352
- You understand?
- Yup.

208
00:22:01.387 --> 00:22:02.815
Tommy.

209
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:03.849
What. Hank?

210
00:22:04.351 --> 00:22:06.555
Don't you make me have to
come out there.

211
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.690
- Copy that. Hank.
-  Oh. Tommy?

212
00:22:09.725 --> 00:22:11.054
Jesus Christ. Hank.
what do you want?

213
00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:13.859
Don't forget the posters.

214
00:22:22.001 --> 00:22:23.770
"Don't forget the posters.

215
00:22:24.372 --> 00:22:26.102
Don't forget the posters."

216
00:22:27.072 --> 00:22:28.478
Fuckin' dickhead.

217
00:22:41.152 --> 00:22:42.085
Sweet dreams. Jimmy.

218
00:22:43.055 --> 00:22:44.054
Shit.

219
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.977
What a waste of good shit.

220
00:23:12.821 --> 00:23:13.820
Fuck it.

221
00:23:25.064 --> 00:23:26.866
"Don't forget the posters."

222
00:23:55.501 --> 00:23:56.632
Woo!

223
00:24:01.199 --> 00:24:03.001
Goodbye. Have fun. Uncle Jack!

224
00:24:03.036 --> 00:24:04.541
We'll be back in a week
to check on ya.

225
00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:06.004
Thanks. Uncle Jack!

226
00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.613
-

227
00:24:37.235 --> 00:24:40.511
Listen. I don't know
what you think you saw.

228
00:24:40.546 --> 00:24:41.743
but I'm a cop. all right?

229
00:24:43.307 --> 00:24:44.515
I ain't gonna hurt you.

230
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.919
I know you can hear me!

231
00:24:56.188 --> 00:24:58.056
Come on out and talk to me.
okay?

232
00:25:07.606 --> 00:25:09.232
Look. what's your plan?

233
00:25:11.236 --> 00:25:13.874
Think you're gonna get outta
here and then call the cops?

234
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:15.777
Who you think's gonna
respond to that?

235
00:25:17.308 --> 00:25:19.275
My people. my crew. that's who.

236
00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:22.080
So let's just make this easy.

237
00:25:25.217 --> 00:25:26.986
I'm gonna put my gun away now.
all right?

238
00:25:39.231 --> 00:25:40.637
Don't shoot. please.

239
00:25:41.299 --> 00:25:42.804
Please. I'm so sorry.

240
00:25:42.839 --> 00:25:43.838
It's okay.

241
00:25:44.106 --> 00:25:45.576
I panicked. I panicked.

242
00:25:45.611 --> 00:25:47.039
I--I just got scared.

243
00:25:47.074 --> 00:25:48.810
And I panicked. I'm sorry.
I heard a shot. that's it.

244
00:25:48.845 --> 00:25:50.240
It's okay. I just need
you to calm down.

245
00:25:50.275 --> 00:25:51.241
Take a deep breath.

246
00:25:51.276 --> 00:25:53.111
I was just hiking.
I don't want any trouble.

247
00:25:53.146 --> 00:25:54.145
Please. please.

248
00:25:55.014 --> 00:25:57.247
Just gonna calm down.
We're gonna stay put.

249
00:25:59.823 --> 00:26:01.251
Okay.
- Okay.

250
00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:06.256
Just gonna get you
back to my car.

251
00:26:06.458 --> 00:26:08.126
We're gonna just talk.
Is that okay?

252
00:26:08.361 --> 00:26:09.093
Okay.
- Okay.

253
00:26:09.129 --> 00:26:10.667
Okay.
- All right.

254
00:26:10.702 --> 00:26:11.965
Okay.Calm down.

255
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.164
It's okay.

256
00:26:14.233 --> 00:26:15.672
It's okay.

257
00:26:15.707 --> 00:26:16.706
It's okay.

258
00:26:18.006 --> 00:26:19.203
Okay.

259
00:26:21.779 --> 00:26:22.877
Billie. I'm here now.

260
00:26:26.378 --> 00:26:28.014
Did you find that stray cat

261
00:26:28.049 --> 00:26:29.180
and put her down?

262
00:26:29.782 --> 00:26:32.150
-

263
00:26:35.353 --> 00:26:37.023
Billie. are you there?

264
00:26:39.192 --> 00:26:41.258
Tommy. I got her.
I'm just up that hill. Hurry up.

265
00:26:41.293 --> 00:26:42.633
I'll be up in a second.

266
00:26:42.668 --> 00:26:44.360
-

267
00:26:44.395 --> 00:26:45.194
Fuck!

268
00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:47.231
-

269
00:26:55.978 --> 00:26:57.208
Batter up.

270
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:06.217
Come on.

271
00:27:22.873 --> 00:27:23.938
She's a slippery one.

272
00:27:27.574 --> 00:27:29.746
- Nice fuckin' work.
- Yeah.

273
00:27:31.277 --> 00:27:32.749
Shit. what the hell
happened to you?

274
00:27:34.412 --> 00:27:36.016
She's tougher than she looks.

275
00:27:38.922 --> 00:27:40.152
So what now?

276
00:27:40.354 --> 00:27:42.924
- Come get this off me.
- Take care of that wound.

277
00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.224
Hank said to use caution.

278
00:27:46.826 --> 00:27:48.930
Get some information
from this chick.

279
00:27:48.965 --> 00:27:50.393
We'll figure out how to proceed.

280
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.771
You remember that time
when we were kids?

281
00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:56.905
You tried to get fresh with me

282
00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.742
after your kid brother
dared you?

283
00:27:59.144 --> 00:28:01.778
I ended up bitin'
the hell outta your hand.

284
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.274
Cried for about a day.

285
00:28:06.378 --> 00:28:07.751
I'd forgotten all about that

286
00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:10.413
till this bitch got her
teeth into me.

287
00:28:16.091 --> 00:28:17.794
Not much has changed with you.

288
00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:21.292
Still doin' all your
brother's dirty work.

289
00:28:21.327 --> 00:28:23.426
Oh shit. and you turned
out just great?

290
00:28:24.902 --> 00:28:27.331
Fallin' for a convict
doin' 40 years?

291
00:28:27.366 --> 00:28:28.970
Single mom?

292
00:28:29.005 --> 00:28:31.071
Know you're lucky
I got you this job.

293
00:28:31.106 --> 00:28:32.303
Who knows what you'd be doin'.

294
00:28:33.239 --> 00:28:37.748
Look at you now. all chewed up
by some city girl.

295
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.080
Fuck you for sayin' that. Tommy.

296
00:28:40.115 --> 00:28:41.114
Know what. Billie?

297
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:42.918
Maybe you'd been better off
lettin' me hook up

298
00:28:42.953 --> 00:28:44.150
with you back then.

299
00:28:44.819 --> 00:28:46.955
We could have gone a whole
different way together.

300
00:28:47.793 --> 00:28:49.386
Don't you wish you had.

301
00:28:58.331 --> 00:28:59.330
Oh shit.

302
00:29:01.466 --> 00:29:02.773
Little worm is movin'.

303
00:29:04.172 --> 00:29:05.908
Oh. let her come to.

304
00:29:07.472 --> 00:29:08.471
You go first.

305
00:29:09.947 --> 00:29:12.178
All right. calm down. Calm down.

306
00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:14.510
Hey. calm down!

307
00:29:14.812 --> 00:29:18.217
All we need to know is what you
think you saw. baby.

308
00:29:18.752 --> 00:29:20.318
So. I'm gonna take
this off you now.

309
00:29:20.353 --> 00:29:22.122
Don't scream.

310
00:29:22.157 --> 00:29:24.454
I'll say I saw

311
00:29:24.489 --> 00:29:25.688
whatever you want me to say.

312
00:29:25.724 --> 00:29:29.129
I'll say--I'll say that I saw
whatever you want me to say.

313
00:29:29.164 --> 00:29:31.835
I will. I'll say it was
a drug bust. okay?

314
00:29:32.037 --> 00:29:33.870
- That's what I'll say.
- I'm sure. hon.

315
00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:36.004
It's just that your response...

316
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.172
suggests that you saw somethin'
you shouldn't have.

317
00:29:39.507 --> 00:29:43.374
I mean. if it were me and
I hadn't seen anything

318
00:29:44.343 --> 00:29:47.015
I'd be here screamin' that
some crazy cops

319
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.511
just started chasin' me
through the woods

320
00:29:48.546 --> 00:29:49.479
for no good reason.

321
00:29:49.814 --> 00:29:51.888
I'd be damn confident about it.

322
00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:54.121
No. no. Please. please.

323
00:29:54.156 --> 00:29:55.584
Shh.

324
00:29:55.619 --> 00:29:58.092
But you weren't very confident.

325
00:29:58.527 --> 00:29:59.863
And that just don't work for us.

326
00:30:00.565 --> 00:30:02.866
Please. I'll say whatever you
want me to say. please.

327
00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:05.429
- Please?
- Do we need to call in Hank?

328
00:30:07.633 --> 00:30:09.499
No. we ain't gotta do that.

329
00:30:10.068 --> 00:30:12.403
Well then do what you gotta do.

330
00:30:15.573 --> 00:30:17.441
- What are you waitin' for?
- Fuck me.

331
00:30:18.143 --> 00:30:20.246
I lost my damn
pistol back there.

332
00:30:21.183 --> 00:30:22.446
Huh?

333
00:30:22.481 --> 00:30:23.579
When she bit me!

334
00:30:24.815 --> 00:30:25.414
- Are you fuckin' with me?
- No. I'm not fuckin' with you.

335
00:30:25.449 --> 00:30:27.352
I was a little distracted!

336
00:30:27.387 --> 00:30:28.892
Jesus Christ. Billie.

337
00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:30.322
Goddamn it. use my gun.

338
00:30:31.158 --> 00:30:32.962
Ya know what.
let's take her up to the marsh

339
00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:34.359
so we can hide her after.

340
00:30:34.394 --> 00:30:35.558
- Fuck.
- I like that idea.

341
00:30:35.893 --> 00:30:38.594
- Damn it.
- All right. get up.

342
00:30:38.629 --> 00:30:40.101
- Come on. get up.
- Come on. baby.

343
00:30:40.136 --> 00:30:41.498
- Calm down.
- Get up goddamn it!

344
00:30:47.077 --> 00:30:48.879
- Get on your knees!

345
00:30:54.249 --> 00:30:56.051
Hang tight.
I'll make sure we're alone.

346
00:30:59.518 --> 00:31:00.551
Please. I'm begging you.

347
00:31:00.586 --> 00:31:02.255
Please. please. please.
you don't have to do this.

348
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.520
I promise I won't say anything.

349
00:31:03.555 --> 00:31:05.093
Please!

350
00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:10.197
Please. please.
somebody help me!

351
00:31:10.232 --> 00:31:11.462
Please!

352
00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:20.944
Please. please. somebody
help me! Please!

353
00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:29.117
All right. Billie. Do it!

354
00:31:39.162 --> 00:31:40.590
What are you waitin' for.
Billie?

355
00:31:40.625 --> 00:31:42.295
Somebody help me. please!

356
00:31:42.497 --> 00:31:43.659
- Please.
-  Billie. do it.

357
00:31:46.136 --> 00:31:47.102
Do it. Billie!

358
00:31:47.137 --> 00:31:49.137
Please. please. please.

359
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:50.941
Please.

360
00:31:56.212 --> 00:31:58.146
I can't shoot her when
she's lookin' me

361
00:31:58.181 --> 00:31:59.378

Jesus Christ. Billie.

363
00:32:03.983 --> 00:32:05.318
Point the gun at her.

All right. we're gonna
do it on three.

00:32:31.348 --> 00:32:33.379

You hear that? Came from there.

00:32:46.691 --> 00:32:47.723
Right in there.

372
00:32:49.397 --> 00:32:50.396
Don't move!

373
00:32:54.402 --> 00:32:56.270
Throw your gun as
far as you can.

374
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:58.668
Throw it!

375
00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:03.211
Hey. I'm not sure how your
eyesight is. pal.

376
00:33:03.446 --> 00:33:04.542
We're the Sheriff's Department.

I see that.

378
00:33:08.218 --> 00:33:10.185
But shit don't go
down like this.

379
00:33:12.651 --> 00:33:13.551
On your knees.

380
00:33:14.752 --> 00:33:16.224
Now. goddamn it!

381
00:33:26.302 --> 00:33:31.602
I'm a cop. 35 years.

382
00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:34.110
What happened?

383
00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:37.014
She assaulted me.
She's some sorta junkie.

384
00:33:37.216 --> 00:33:39.280
They're lying.
She murdered someone.

385
00:33:39.315 --> 00:33:40.644
She's a fuckin' liar!

386
00:33:42.648 --> 00:33:44.318
Everybody calm down.

387
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.222
Here's what we're gonna do.

388
00:33:48.786 --> 00:33:51.358
We're all goin' down to
the police station.

389
00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.393
We're gonna figure this out.

390
00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:55.593
Yeah. that sounds like
a plan to me.

391
00:33:56.362 --> 00:33:58.266
Hey. Billie. be a doll
and get my gun.

392
00:33:58.468 --> 00:33:59.564
Don't you move.

393
00:33:59.799 --> 00:34:03.403
If this guy's a cop.
by golly I think he is.

394
00:34:03.772 --> 00:34:05.405
he's not gonna shoot
another cop.

395
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.802
Don't fuck around.

396
00:34:07.404 --> 00:34:08.804
I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do.

397
00:34:08.839 --> 00:34:09.805
I'm gonna stand up.

398
00:34:10.374 --> 00:34:12.148
If this jackass
doesn't shoot me.

399
00:34:12.783 --> 00:34:15.118
Billie. get my fuckin' gun.

400
00:34:19.256 --> 00:34:22.653

What about them?

412
00:34:56.255 --> 00:34:57.754
Just clean up your tracks.

413
00:34:58.123 --> 00:35:00.724
Don't worry. we'll find 'em.

414
00:35:15.873 --> 00:35:16.839
Wait for me.

00:35:37.895 --> 00:35:40.335
You think he'll be real mad?

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.700
Does the Tin Man have
a sheet metal cock?

422
00:36:17.374 --> 00:36:18.967
Where'd you go?

423
00:36:52.772 --> 00:36:53.804

Go check it out.

429
00:37:29.006 --> 00:37:30.379

There's a shed

He's already on his way.

That's good.

487
00:42:16.832 --> 00:42:17.963
Come on.

488
00:42:17.998 --> 00:42:20.163

I'm not gonna hurt you.

Just...just let me help. okay?

496
00:43:13.889 --> 00:43:14.888
Sit on the rock.

497
00:43:15.957 --> 00:43:16.956
Okay.

498
00:43:21.798 --> 00:43:23.325
I didn't do anything wrong.
I was just hiking.

499
00:43:29.267 --> 00:43:30.266
I believe you.

500
00:43:33.172 --> 00:43:35.073
You don't look
like a criminal to me.

501
00:43:38.177 --> 00:43:41.211
If we got to know each other.
maybe it would help.

502
00:43:42.379 --> 00:43:43.818
Just the basics.

503
00:43:47.351 --> 00:43:50.726
My name is Jack. Jack Harris.

504
00:43:52.158 --> 00:43:53.256
I'm a cop.

505
00:43:58.164 --> 00:43:59.163
My wife. uh...

506
00:44:01.101 --> 00:44:03.332
uh. um...

507
00:44:04.709 --> 00:44:08.238
she died three weeks ago.

508
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:13.078
Uh. cancer. yeah.

509
00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:16.851
That's why I'm here.

510
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:21.757
Early retirement.

511
00:44:27.061 --> 00:44:28.324
My name is Shannon Mathers.

512
00:44:29.393 --> 00:44:30.392
I capture images.

513
00:44:33.034 --> 00:44:34.033
Images?

514
00:44:35.432 --> 00:44:36.871
I'm a photojournalist.

515
00:44:39.238 --> 00:44:40.237
I. um...

516
00:44:40.706 --> 00:44:44.978
I...I guess I came out here
to prove my father wrong.

517
00:44:47.477 --> 00:44:50.346
He grew up around here.
He...he really loved it.

518
00:44:54.759 --> 00:44:57.056
He always said these woods
were too tough for me.

519
00:44:59.423 --> 00:45:00.422
too hard to hike.

520
00:45:02.767 --> 00:45:04.459
He used to call me
his little quitter.

521
00:45:07.431 --> 00:45:09.332
Well. let's prove him wrong.

522
00:45:12.007 --> 00:45:13.006
He's dead. Jack.

523
00:45:15.912 --> 00:45:17.813
I came out here to
spread his ashes.

524
00:45:20.444 --> 00:45:22.312
I just couldn't make it to
the place where he wanted them.

525
00:45:22.914 --> 00:45:26.448
So. I guess he was right.

526
00:45:27.418 --> 00:45:29.286
It's just too fucking much.

527
00:45:32.159 --> 00:45:33.290
I'm sorry.

528
00:45:36.493 --> 00:45:38.966
Shannon. I think we have
something in common.

529
00:45:41.432 --> 00:45:42.805
What's that?

530
00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:47.337
We shouldn't have come
to this fucking place.

531
00:45:50.375 --> 00:45:51.473
You got a phone?

532
00:45:53.543 --> 00:45:54.850
It's back with my stuff.

533
00:45:58.251 --> 00:45:59.789
Shannon. you can trust me.

534
00:46:01.518 --> 00:46:03.122
What we need is evidence.

535
00:46:05.291 --> 00:46:06.356
I need my camera.

536
00:46:07.458 --> 00:46:08.996
I have footage.

537
00:46:09.031 --> 00:46:10.426
Everything that you
need to know is on there.

538
00:46:10.995 --> 00:46:12.461
It's back with my things.

539
00:46:18.304 --> 00:46:19.303
Get the camera.

540
00:46:20.372 --> 00:46:21.503
Bring it back.

541
00:46:21.538 --> 00:46:23.142
We'll meet back here.

542
00:46:23.177 --> 00:46:27.047
I'm gonna get back to
my cabin to get my phone.

543
00:46:28.512 --> 00:46:31.183
I know someone
who can help us.

544
00:46:36.388 --> 00:46:39.092
Shannon there's no quitting now.
you understand?

545
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.489
Okay.

546
00:47:07.925 --> 00:47:09.584
- I can't go anymore.
- Come on. we're almost--

547
00:47:09.619 --> 00:47:12.191
- I can't go anymore. Tommy.
- Come on. Billie.

548
00:47:12.226 --> 00:47:13.489
- I can't!
- We're almost outta here.

549
00:47:13.524 --> 00:47:14.424
You gotta lay me down.

550
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.493
All right. here.
I'm puttin' you down here.

551
00:47:27.637 --> 00:47:29.406
Oh. hey. brother.

552
00:47:30.041 --> 00:47:32.948
Hey. Shit just got
outta control.

553
00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:35.148
Let's see what we got.

554
00:47:37.922 --> 00:47:39.449
Oh.

555
00:47:42.322 --> 00:47:45.928
Chief. we gotta get goin'.

556
00:47:46.297 --> 00:47:48.029
Oh. Billie.

557
00:47:48.231 --> 00:47:50.427
Chief. you gotta help me.

558
00:47:50.896 --> 00:47:53.595
Well. that's somethin'.

559
00:47:54.364 --> 00:47:56.906
What the fuck are you doin'
just lookin' at it?

560
00:47:56.941 --> 00:47:58.303
We gotta go!

561
00:48:00.571 --> 00:48:02.571
Billie. you just stay strong.
okay?

562
00:48:04.278 --> 00:48:05.277
All right.

563
00:48:08.612 --> 00:48:10.183
Where are you goin'?

564
00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.155
- She's lookin' pretty bad.

565
00:48:18.193 --> 00:48:19.489
Yeah.

566
00:48:19.924 --> 00:48:22.327
We got some serious
time constraints here.

567
00:48:24.661 --> 00:48:27.266
I know you guys
are close but. um.

568
00:48:27.301 --> 00:48:29.433
well. she's in bad shape. okay?

569
00:48:29.468 --> 00:48:31.270
And by the time we get
her outta here.

570
00:48:32.006 --> 00:48:36.374
chances are she ain't gonna
be with us anymore.

571
00:48:36.709 --> 00:48:39.542
In the meantime. them two
unintendeds will be long gone.

572
00:48:40.281 --> 00:48:41.544
Now. look.

573
00:48:41.579 --> 00:48:43.953
We got ourselves
a serious situation

574
00:48:43.988 --> 00:48:46.153
that needs resolvin'. right?

575
00:48:46.188 --> 00:48:47.187
And quick.

576
00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:52.522
I told you not to call me.
didn't I?

577
00:48:53.157 --> 00:48:55.492
But now that you did. well...

578
00:48:57.133 --> 00:48:59.034
I think you know
what you have to do.

579
00:49:03.574 --> 00:49:04.699
She's got a little kid at home.

580
00:49:09.178 --> 00:49:11.673
Listen to me. Tommy.
and you listen good.

581
00:49:12.275 --> 00:49:14.346
I shouldn't be
out here right now.

582
00:49:14.381 --> 00:49:17.646
I am one goddamn week away
from that election and you are--

583
00:49:20.288 --> 00:49:22.684
and you are the first
in line for my spot

584
00:49:22.719 --> 00:49:24.257
once I get what's comin' to me.

585
00:49:25.722 --> 00:49:27.590
But this is your mess now.
too. brother.

586
00:49:27.625 --> 00:49:28.690
You understand. right?

587
00:49:29.459 --> 00:49:31.627
What. you think I didn't
have to get my hands

588
00:49:31.662 --> 00:49:33.464
a little bit dirty to
get where I am?

589
00:49:34.698 --> 00:49:36.599
Shit. you know what?

590
00:49:37.734 --> 00:49:39.305
If you really had what it took.

591
00:49:40.737 --> 00:49:42.539
you'd have already handled
this business by now.

592
00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:44.310
But. no.

593
00:49:44.745 --> 00:49:47.511
No. all you know how to do
is think with your dick.

594
00:49:50.219 --> 00:49:51.218
That's not true.

595
00:49:54.751 --> 00:49:55.684
I got what it takes.

596
00:49:55.719 --> 00:49:57.290
Then prove it. brother.

597
00:49:57.325 --> 00:49:59.688
Put her outta her misery
and then let's finish this

598
00:49:59.723 --> 00:50:02.361
before we actually have
a problem we can't fix.

599
00:50:05.696 --> 00:50:07.267
What do you want me to do?

600
00:50:09.139 --> 00:50:10.567
Shoot her in the fuckin' face?

601
00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:13.273
Fuckin' stupid. Tommy.

602
00:50:13.308 --> 00:50:14.703
She's bleedin' out.

603
00:50:14.738 --> 00:50:16.672
We got a murder weapon
with prints all over it.

604
00:50:16.707 --> 00:50:19.114
Now. this is a closed case
as far as you. I.

605
00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:20.577
or anyone will know.

606
00:50:21.513 --> 00:50:24.284
Just get your ass over there
and tend to that wound.

607
00:50:24.319 --> 00:50:25.318
Come on.

608
00:50:25.553 --> 00:50:26.517
Go on.

609
00:50:26.785 --> 00:50:28.123
Come on!

610
00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:29.157
Be all right.

611
00:50:34.824 --> 00:50:35.625
Go on.

612
00:50:42.469 --> 00:50:44.502
Tommy. I can't feel
my legs no more.

613
00:50:44.904 --> 00:50:46.504
You're gonna have to carry me.

614
00:50:46.806 --> 00:50:48.143
It's all right. Billie.

615
00:50:49.674 --> 00:50:50.739
You'll be okay.

616
00:50:51.874 --> 00:50:53.049
Sorry.

617
00:50:54.252 --> 00:50:55.348
- No. Tommy. what are you doin'?
-  Shh. just relax.

618
00:50:55.383 --> 00:50:56.514
- Shh.
- No.

619
00:50:56.813 --> 00:50:58.252
No!

620
00:50:58.650 --> 00:50:59.649
Shh. shh.

621
00:51:00.752 --> 00:51:01.651
- I got a son at home. Tommy.
-  It's okay.

622
00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:03.653
I'm gonna take care of him.
I'm gonna take care of it.

623
00:51:03.688 --> 00:51:05.325
I'll take care of everything.
okay?

624
00:51:05.527 --> 00:51:08.229
Fuckin' let me go. Tommy.

625
00:51:08.264 --> 00:51:09.857
Gonna be okay. Shh.

626
00:51:09.892 --> 00:51:11.826
No. Tommy.

627
00:51:11.861 --> 00:51:14.202
Stop fightin'. Billie. Please.

628
00:51:15.469 --> 00:51:16.732
Just be still.

629
00:51:16.767 --> 00:51:19.108
I don't wanna die. Tommy.

630
00:51:20.771 --> 00:51:22.474
It's gonna be okay.

631
00:51:22.709 --> 00:51:25.774
- It's all right.
- Tommy. please. I'll do better.

632
00:51:25.809 --> 00:51:26.808
I promise.

633
00:51:27.911 --> 00:51:30.449
Sheriff thinks it's
too late for that now.

634
00:51:31.551 --> 00:51:33.320
It's gonna be okay.

635
00:51:33.655 --> 00:51:34.816
Just relax.

636
00:51:34.851 --> 00:51:36.785
It'll be over soon.

637
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.494
Promise you'll
take care of my son.

638
00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:44.826
I love you. Billie.

639
00:51:51.868 --> 00:51:55.672
-

640
00:52:28.938 --> 00:52:30.476
Well done.

641
00:52:30.511 --> 00:52:31.708
I always knew you had it in ya.

642
00:52:36.913 --> 00:52:38.253
What are we gonna do now?

643
00:52:38.981 --> 00:52:40.156
We finish this.

644
00:52:41.522 --> 00:52:43.258
They been runnin'
for 10 minutes.

645
00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:45.359
Why are you so calm?

646
00:52:46.956 --> 00:52:48.626
'Cause that's part of it.
big brother.

647
00:52:48.928 --> 00:52:49.726
You'll see.

648
00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:52.828
Now. where do you think
they might be?

649
00:52:53.096 --> 00:52:54.566
I don't know.

650
00:52:56.438 --> 00:52:57.932
Off in the distance
I saw a cabin.

651
00:52:59.276 --> 00:53:00.572
That's where they're goin'.

652
00:53:01.905 --> 00:53:02.904
How do you know?

653
00:53:05.315 --> 00:53:09.581
Because unlike you.
I've got intuition. Tommy.

654
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:11.220
It comes in handy.

655
00:53:12.652 --> 00:53:15.620
You see. I have
the ability to put myself

656
00:53:15.655 --> 00:53:19.294
in other people's shoes and
that's where I'd be goin'

657
00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:21.659
if I was on the run tryin'
to save my life.

658
00:53:23.729 --> 00:53:24.695
But you tell me.

659
00:53:25.797 --> 00:53:27.599
What's your workin' theory.
brother?

660
00:53:31.275 --> 00:53:32.340
That's what I thought.

661
00:53:34.443 --> 00:53:35.871
Get her back to the car.

662
00:53:35.906 --> 00:53:37.609
We have to set up the narrative.

663
00:53:38.078 --> 00:53:41.481
Take the weapon and we'll get
some prints off that thing.

664
00:53:41.516 --> 00:53:42.746
Gotta get it all in the car.

665
00:53:42.781 --> 00:53:44.583
I think we can make this work.

666
00:53:44.618 --> 00:53:45.617
What are you gonna do?

667
00:53:46.252 --> 00:53:48.389
Clean up your goddamn mess.

668
00:53:48.424 --> 00:53:49.786
We got work to do. big brother.

669
00:53:50.822 --> 00:53:54.329
Looks like we gots ourselves
a cop killer on the loose.

670
00:56:54.071 --> 00:56:55.070
You reached Tom.

671
00:56:55.106 --> 00:56:57.105
I'm not about to pick up
my phone right now.

672
00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.513
Leave a message.

673
00:56:58.548 --> 00:56:59.976
- Hi. Tommy.

674
00:57:01.012 --> 00:57:02.979
Hope your project's goin' well.

675
00:57:03.348 --> 00:57:05.520
Surprised I haven't heard
from you about it yet.

676
00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:09.656
But I suppose that just means
you're hard at work.

677
00:57:11.528 --> 00:57:12.989
Why don't you give us a call?

678
00:57:16.698 --> 00:57:19.468
-

679
00:57:55.638 --> 00:57:59.068
Billie. I'm gonna
make this right.

680
00:58:00.203 --> 00:58:01.576
You'll see.

681
00:58:48.284 --> 00:58:49.217
Ah.

682
00:59:47.211 --> 00:59:50.278
Dad. I really need your help.

683
00:59:51.347 --> 00:59:53.017
I'm all alone and I'm scared.

684
00:59:54.286 --> 00:59:58.220
Please. for the first time.
just tell me I can do this.

685
00:59:59.828 --> 01:00:00.827
Can you hear me?

686
01:00:03.227 --> 01:00:07.966
Just gimme a sign. Anything.

687
01:00:29.319 --> 01:00:34.256
-

688
01:00:46.875 --> 01:00:49.744
-  Freeze. goddamn it!

689
01:00:50.472 --> 01:00:51.647
Freeze!

690
01:00:52.342 --> 01:00:53.374
Stop.

691
01:00:53.409 --> 01:00:55.277
Fuckin' bitch. Stop!

692
01:00:58.249 --> 01:00:59.380
Bitch.

693
01:01:05.223 --> 01:01:06.255
Stop.

694
01:01:06.991 --> 01:01:09.423
-

695
01:01:14.936 --> 01:01:16.331
Bitch.

696
01:01:38.091 --> 01:01:40.355
You bitch. I'm gonna kill you.

697
01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:44.997
Goddamn it. freeze.

698
01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:09.285
-

699
01:02:10.255 --> 01:02:11.353
This is for Billie.

700
01:02:13.156 --> 01:02:15.357
Don't you know that
it's time to quit?

701
01:02:16.259 --> 01:02:18.294
He always said these
woods were too tough for me.

702
01:02:18.796 --> 01:02:20.329
He used to call me
his little quitter.

703
01:02:20.998 --> 01:02:24.300
I'm not quitting or anything.
I promise.

704
01:02:24.602 --> 01:02:26.841
Shannon there's no quitting.

705
01:02:27.305 --> 01:02:28.304
You understand?

706
01:02:29.505 --> 01:02:31.142
Then let's prove him wrong.

707
01:02:31.344 --> 01:02:33.540
Just gimme a sign. Anything.

708
01:02:33.575 --> 01:02:36.477
-

709
01:03:37.408 --> 01:03:38.274
Hey. Tommy.

710
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:40.816
Things appear to be
a dead end for me.

711
01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:43.577
So. why don't we just
touch base ASAP. okay?

712
01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:46.954
Fuckin' moron.

713
01:03:49.123 --> 01:03:50.122
Huh.

714
01:03:51.554 --> 01:03:54.929
Lazy son of a bitch.

715
01:03:56.163 --> 01:03:57.558
You reached Tom.

716
01:03:57.593 --> 01:03:59.560
I'm not about to pick up
my phone right now.

717
01:03:59.595 --> 01:04:01.463
- Leave a message.
-

718
01:04:02.432 --> 01:04:04.598
I'm gonna need you to
call me back right now.

719
01:04:04.933 --> 01:04:06.270
You got that?

720
01:04:08.307 --> 01:04:10.538
Stupid fuckin' donkey.

721
01:04:54.188 --> 01:04:55.319
Well. you were here.

722
01:04:58.225 --> 01:04:59.521
Talk to me.

723
01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:02.898
Come on. goddamn it.

724
01:05:04.198 --> 01:05:05.197
Show me somethin'.

725
01:05:19.114 --> 01:05:20.311
Depression. huh?

726
01:05:20.646 --> 01:05:23.380
Well. that's a shame.

727
01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:26.680
What the hell are you doin'
all the way up here

728
01:05:26.715 --> 01:05:28.352
in my neck of the wood?

729
01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:36.327
Oh. you're sad.

730
01:05:43.204 --> 01:05:44.203
Shit.

731
01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:51.639
Well. looks like you're
way outta your jurisdiction.

732
01:05:51.674 --> 01:05:53.146
my friend.

733
01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:13.067
I'll be goddamned.

734
01:06:21.671 --> 01:06:22.978

735
01:06:24.212 --> 01:06:25.277
31-21.

736
01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:30.579
Hey. dispatch.

737
01:06:30.614 --> 01:06:32.053

738
01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:33.582
and patch me over to Pam Harris?

739
01:06:33.617 --> 01:06:34.715
Sure thing.

740
01:06:41.526 --> 01:06:42.624
Hello. sir.

741
01:06:42.659 --> 01:06:43.724
Hey. Pam!

742
01:06:45.398 --> 01:06:48.036
I'm so sorry to bother ya
on your day off.

743
01:06:48.071 --> 01:06:49.070
Hey. no worries.

744
01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:51.633
Just please tell me you got me
somethin' excitin'.

745
01:06:51.668 --> 01:06:53.602
Oh. I guess it's a little better

746
01:06:53.637 --> 01:06:55.538
than that possum call
the other day.

747
01:06:58.774 --> 01:07:03.777
small world. but would you
happen to have a relative

748
01:07:03.812 --> 01:07:06.252
workin' in the Philly PD?

749
01:07:07.387 --> 01:07:08.650
Wait. Wow.

750
01:07:09.185 --> 01:07:10.586
Yeah. my Uncle Jack.

751
01:07:10.621 --> 01:07:11.653
He just retired.

752
01:07:12.022 --> 01:07:13.556
You don't say?

753
01:07:13.791 --> 01:07:15.459
Yeah. in fact he's in town.

754
01:07:15.494 --> 01:07:16.691
He's visiting the family cabin.

755
01:07:16.726 --> 01:07:18.099
He's just tryin' to
get some rest.

756
01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:19.529
Why do you ask?

757
01:07:19.564 --> 01:07:22.565
Well. Pam. turns out
your Uncle Jack and I

758
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.073
have a mutual
acquaintance in common

759
01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:28.340
and I would love to
chew his ear on some things.

760
01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:30.243
Well. that'd be great.

761
01:07:30.778 --> 01:07:32.740
Um. I'm sure he'd love to talk.

762
01:07:32.775 --> 01:07:36.348
His wife passed recently and
it's been really hard on him.

763
01:07:37.582 --> 01:07:39.648
Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that.

764
01:07:40.585 --> 01:07:42.585
Well. could you be a sport

765
01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.093
and text me over
his cell phone number?

766
01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:48.294
Maybe I'll take him out for
a beer or somethin'.

767
01:07:49.495 --> 01:07:50.758
That'd be great.

768
01:07:50.793 --> 01:07:52.463
Perfect. Of course.

769
01:07:52.698 --> 01:07:54.663
Thanks. Pam.
You've been a great help.

770
01:07:54.998 --> 01:07:57.798
I'll let you know if I come
across any more possums.

771
01:07:57.833 --> 01:07:59.668
Okay. bye now.

772
01:08:47.586 --> 01:08:48.783
You got this.

773
01:08:54.824 --> 01:08:56.230
You reached Tom.

774
01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:57.528
I'm not about to pick up my--

775
01:08:58.729 --> 01:09:00.366
Pick up your goddamn phone.
Tommy!

776
01:09:08.574 --> 01:09:10.904
Tommy! Tommy!

777
01:09:12.776 --> 01:09:13.907
Tom!

778
01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:21.750
What the fuck?

779
01:09:23.886 --> 01:09:25.292
Tommy!

780
01:10:53.481 --> 01:10:54.678
Damn you two.

781
01:10:59.751 --> 01:11:01.487
You really fucked
this up for me.

782
01:11:22.906 --> 01:11:24.312
Yeah.
- Listen. Frank.

783
01:11:24.747 --> 01:11:26.908
I'm gonna need you to go pick up
Pam Harris. okay?

784
01:11:26.943 --> 01:11:28.514
You know she's off today.

785
01:11:28.549 --> 01:11:29.680
It doesn't matter.

786
01:11:30.949 --> 01:11:32.716
Tell her I wanna recommend her
for a promotion or somethin'.

787
01:11:32.751 --> 01:11:34.784
I just need her in our custody.
understand?

788
01:11:35.219 --> 01:11:37.358
And Frank.
don't tell her too much.

789
01:11:42.959 --> 01:11:44.497
Go on. get in.

790
01:12:03.947 --> 01:12:05.386
So. uh...

791
01:12:06.719 --> 01:12:08.554
how long you been
in dispatch now?

792
01:12:09.089 --> 01:12:11.920
A little over a year.
I guess. now.

793
01:12:13.594 --> 01:12:14.593
Why?

794
01:12:15.728 --> 01:12:17.728
Sounds like Hank's got
a plan for you.

795
01:12:20.799 --> 01:12:22.601
So. what's this all about?

796
01:12:23.103 --> 01:12:27.639
Seems like he wants to give you
some sort of leg up.

797
01:12:31.909 --> 01:12:33.909
Where was it you said we
were goin' again?

798
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:37.616
Nowhere right now. anyway.

799
01:12:41.787 --> 01:12:42.786
Hank'll call soon.

800
01:12:44.889 --> 01:12:45.954
You just sit tight.

801
01:13:06.108 --> 01:13:07.074
Hi. Jack.

802
01:13:07.813 --> 01:13:09.142
With the girl?

803
01:13:09.177 --> 01:13:09.809
Who is this?

804
01:13:10.112 --> 01:13:12.585
Oh. my apologies.

805
01:13:12.787 --> 01:13:14.114
Let me introduce myself.

806
01:13:15.084 --> 01:13:16.083
Hank Rivers.

807
01:13:16.785 --> 01:13:19.625
Now. you mighta seen
my election signs

808
01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:20.824
on your way into town.

809
01:13:22.465 --> 01:13:25.532
Been kind of a interesting
day. wouldn't you say?

810
01:13:27.096 --> 01:13:28.667
I suppose it only makes sense

811
01:13:28.702 --> 01:13:30.933
you're a little bit tongue-tied
at the moment. Jack.

812
01:13:30.968 --> 01:13:33.133
so let's just get down to it.

813
01:13:34.169 --> 01:13:35.839
You and that girl you're helpin'

814
01:13:35.874 --> 01:13:37.610
killed two of my officers today.

815
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:40.679
How did you get this number?

816
01:13:40.714 --> 01:13:42.142
Oh. we'll get to that. Jack.

817
01:13:42.811 --> 01:13:44.947
Right now I need you to
pay attention.

818
01:13:45.449 --> 01:13:47.785
Are you with the girl?

819
01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:48.819
No!

820
01:13:50.055 --> 01:13:51.019
Really?
Well. that's a damn shame.

821
01:13:52.154 --> 01:13:54.154
See. a lotta lives
were lost today.

822
01:13:55.124 --> 01:13:56.695
I'd hate for there to be more.

823
01:13:58.193 --> 01:13:59.797
Now. come on. Jack.

824
01:14:00.599 --> 01:14:03.900
Now. I'm sure you put
the pieces together by now.

825
01:14:05.002 --> 01:14:06.738
I found your badge.

826
01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:10.874
Now. back at the cabin.
can you imagine my surprise

827
01:14:10.909 --> 01:14:13.778
when I found out you and I
had a mutual friend?

828
01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:16.176
I mean. wow.

829
01:14:16.912 --> 01:14:19.949
Shit gets real tricky when
family's involved.

830
01:14:19.984 --> 01:14:20.983
doesn't it. Jack?

831
01:14:22.151 --> 01:14:25.218
Pam?
That lovely niece of yours?

832
01:14:27.222 --> 01:14:29.761
She's one hell of a dispatcher.
I'll give her that.

833
01:14:30.995 --> 01:14:32.863
You know what I like about
workin' with her?

834
01:14:33.536 --> 01:14:35.228
She's ambitious.

835
01:14:35.263 --> 01:14:41.003
Wants to get out in the field.
get some real action.

836
01:14:41.271 --> 01:14:44.842
Well. I reckon I may now
need to oblige her.

837
01:14:44.877 --> 01:14:46.173
Leave her outta this.

838
01:14:47.682 --> 01:14:49.176
Oh. I'd love to. Jack.

839
01:14:49.978 --> 01:14:54.115
but like I said.
she's hungry for some danger.

840
01:14:56.053 --> 01:14:57.184
What do you want?

841
01:14:58.319 --> 01:15:00.154
I swear. if you touch my niece.

842
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:03.058
You just bring me the girl.

843
01:15:03.093 --> 01:15:04.598
and your niece stays safe.

844
01:15:05.568 --> 01:15:06.567
I give you my word.

845
01:15:07.328 --> 01:15:08.569
Come on. Jack.

846
01:15:11.167 --> 01:15:13.937
Haven't we both dealt with
enough loss lately?

847
01:15:16.238 --> 01:15:18.106
- You killed my brother. Jack.
-  What?

848
01:15:18.408 --> 01:15:19.613
I di--

849
01:15:20.209 --> 01:15:21.945
I didn't kill anyone.

850
01:15:22.614 --> 01:15:24.882
Well then.
I guess we both know who did.

851
01:15:24.917 --> 01:15:25.916
now don't we?

852
01:15:26.985 --> 01:15:29.216
Bring me the girl. Jack.

853
01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:31.988
No guns.

854
01:15:32.457 --> 01:15:35.629
Just a fair exchange of
the prisoner for your niece

855
01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:36.762
and we call it a day.

856
01:15:38.161 --> 01:15:39.699
Okay. okay. I'll do it.

857
01:15:40.268 --> 01:15:45.265
And Jack. you try anything
funny. anything foolish.

858
01:15:45.734 --> 01:15:48.268
both you and Pam will
disappear for good.

859
01:15:48.303 --> 01:15:50.237
I can promise you that.

860
01:15:50.272 --> 01:15:51.271
You understand?

861
01:15:54.012 --> 01:15:55.242
Yeah. copy that.

862
01:15:55.477 --> 01:15:56.716
Good.

863
01:15:57.151 --> 01:15:58.278
You have 10 minutes.

864
01:16:11.326 --> 01:16:12.699
Shannon.

865
01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:19.838
Shannon. wait.

866
01:16:26.979 --> 01:16:28.308
Shannon. wait.

867
01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:39.187
Wait. stop running.

868
01:17:12.829 --> 01:17:14.629
Open up. Please.

869
01:17:15.995 --> 01:17:16.961
Help me.

870
01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:19.700
I need your help.

871
01:17:20.102 --> 01:17:21.328
Open up the door. please.

872
01:17:21.363 --> 01:17:22.462
No. go away
or I'll call the police.

873
01:17:22.498 --> 01:17:24.067
- Please. Please. please.
- I will call the police!

874
01:17:24.102 --> 01:17:25.365
I need your help.

875
01:17:25.567 --> 01:17:27.235
Open the door. Please help me.

876
01:17:28.909 --> 01:17:29.974
Okay. hold on.

877
01:17:41.053 --> 01:17:42.283
Oh. God.
Take whatever you want--

878
01:17:42.318 --> 01:17:43.416
No. no. no.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

879
01:17:43.451 --> 01:17:44.758
I'm not gonna hurt you.

880
01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:46.419
- I promise you.
- Please.

881
01:17:46.454 --> 01:17:47.695
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Stop.

882
01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:49.059
Where are the keys to your car?

883
01:17:49.094 --> 01:17:50.324
They're in my bedroom.
They're in the dresser drawer.

884
01:17:50.359 --> 01:17:51.699
We need to go.
We need to go now.

885
01:17:51.734 --> 01:17:52.865
- No.
- Now.

886
01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:53.966
- No.
- We gotta get outta here.

887
01:17:54.001 --> 01:17:56.066
Listen. there's a man that's
tryin' to get me killed.

888
01:17:56.101 --> 01:17:57.331
- Go.
- Okay. okay.

889
01:18:03.911 --> 01:18:05.680
Shannon.
- Fuck you. Jack.

890
01:18:06.309 --> 01:18:07.440
There's still a way.

891
01:18:17.386 --> 01:18:21.322
-

892
01:18:21.524 --> 01:18:22.697
Open the door.

893
01:18:24.459 --> 01:18:26.426
I'm not fucking around anymore.
Jack.

894
01:18:26.461 --> 01:18:27.867
I don't give a fuck
about your niece

895
01:18:28.069 --> 01:18:29.770
or any of your psycho
fucking cop friends.

896
01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:31.970
I've been through enough today.
do you understand me?

897
01:18:32.405 --> 01:18:35.138
I--I know. Shannon. Yes.

898
01:18:36.273 --> 01:18:37.811
I was never gonna bring you.

899
01:18:40.013 --> 01:18:43.883
I just needed a second to think.

900
01:18:44.518 --> 01:18:47.117
Can we just talk
again like before?

901
01:18:54.192 --> 01:18:55.323
Just listen to me.

902
01:18:55.992 --> 01:18:57.490
Just let me think for a minute.

903
01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:00.229
Talk.

904
01:19:00.664 --> 01:19:02.132
We're in this together.

905
01:19:03.366 --> 01:19:04.431
We're running outta time.

906
01:19:06.567 --> 01:19:09.205
I'm not hearing a plan. Jack.

907
01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.844
I am working on it.

908
01:19:12.111 --> 01:19:13.176
The third guy.

909
01:19:14.311 --> 01:19:16.311
He never saw you. right?

910
01:19:17.512 --> 01:19:18.445
No.

911
01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:21.052
He doesn't know
what you look like.

912
01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:24.517
He doesn't know
what you sound like.

913
01:19:26.158 --> 01:19:29.159
Get back. Please.

914
01:19:30.426 --> 01:19:31.898
Just stay.

915
01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.067
I'll put that woman on
the phone so he hears a voice.

916
01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:39.367
That will save my niece.

917
01:19:41.074 --> 01:19:42.370
What about my life?

918
01:19:43.005 --> 01:19:47.848
You've gotta get the video to
the FBI's office. Fast.

919
01:19:49.313 --> 01:19:50.510
What?

920
01:19:50.545 --> 01:19:51.346
It's our only chance.

921
01:19:53.988 --> 01:19:56.054
It's the only chance
we got right now.

922
01:20:04.592 --> 01:20:05.393
Okay.

923
01:20:30.255 --> 01:20:32.189
Don't worry.
I'll be back for you.

924
01:20:32.224 --> 01:20:33.960
We'll make this proper.

925
01:20:35.898 --> 01:20:36.897
Shit.

926
01:20:40.397 --> 01:20:42.166
- Well?
-  I've got her.

927
01:20:42.368 --> 01:20:45.840
We're at the cabin right off
Route 92 in Easton Lake.

928
01:20:46.042 --> 01:20:47.171
Put her on.

929
01:20:54.642 --> 01:20:56.543
This is Shannon Mathers.

930
01:20:56.878 --> 01:20:59.315
I was born 8-9-88.

931
01:20:59.617 --> 01:21:01.515
I am from Philadelphia.

932
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:03.451
Well. thank you. honey.

933
01:21:03.486 --> 01:21:05.585
I'm gonna sort all this out.
okay?

934
01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.356
Don't you worry now.

935
01:21:08.227 --> 01:21:09.424
Please put Jack back on.

936
01:21:14.101 --> 01:21:16.068
Are we good?

937
01:21:16.103 --> 01:21:17.169
We'll see.

938
01:21:17.204 --> 01:21:19.467
Bring the girl back here and
we'll figure things out.

939
01:21:20.002 --> 01:21:21.601
I'm not goin' anywhere

940
01:21:21.636 --> 01:21:23.603
until I know my niece is safe.

941
01:21:23.638 --> 01:21:24.879
Jack. I'm...

942
01:21:27.708 --> 01:21:29.213
Here's what we're gonna do.

943
01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.150
Now. I'll make that happen.
Jack.

944
01:21:33.186 --> 01:21:34.251
But here's the thing.

945
01:21:34.987 --> 01:21:37.254
You're gonna stay on
the phone right now

946
01:21:37.289 --> 01:21:39.487
and I wanna hear the girl
countin' the whole time.

947
01:21:40.122 --> 01:21:41.522
What?

948
01:21:41.857 --> 01:21:44.327
Have her start at one and
keep goin' till I get there.

949
01:21:44.362 --> 01:21:45.933
however long it takes.

950
01:21:45.968 --> 01:21:47.902
I wanna hear that pretty
little voice countin'.

951
01:21:48.137 --> 01:21:49.332
Okay. okay.

952
01:21:54.174 --> 01:22:01.179
One. two. three. four.

953
01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:08.252
That good?

954
01:22:08.287 --> 01:22:09.385
Yeah. that's good.

955
01:22:10.621 --> 01:22:13.059
and there better not be any
disruptions or interruptions.

956
01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:14.390
You understand?

957
01:22:15.226 --> 01:22:20.330
Oh. and Jack. don't you dare
try any dumb shit

958
01:22:20.365 --> 01:22:21.661
or even think about runnin'.

959
01:22:21.696 --> 01:22:22.695
You get me?

960
01:22:24.171 --> 01:22:25.665
426.

961
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:29.207
427.

962
01:22:30.738 --> 01:22:32.210
428.

963
01:22:33.642 --> 01:22:35.378
429...

964
01:22:37.481 --> 01:22:38.480
Come in. Hank.

965
01:22:39.681 --> 01:22:41.450
431...

966
01:22:42.585 --> 01:22:43.651
Go on.

967
01:22:43.686 --> 01:22:45.652
Yeah. I got a call here from
a young lady inquiring

968
01:22:45.687 --> 01:22:47.687
about filing a missing
persons report.

969
01:22:51.363 --> 01:22:52.362
Oh yeah?

970
01:22:53.465 --> 01:22:55.629
Yeah. she said that her friend.

01:22:55.664 --> 01:22:58.269

her to pick her up by now.

972
01:22:58.304 --> 01:22:59.600
Wants to file a report.

973
01:23:00.235 --> 01:23:02.372
436...

974
01:23:05.245 --> 01:23:07.014
Well. you just call her back.

975
01:23:07.049 --> 01:23:08.510

to the office

976
01:23:08.545 --> 01:23:10.248
and stay put till I get back.

977
01:23:11.482 --> 01:23:12.778
You hear?

978
01:23:12.813 --> 01:23:15.088
Copy that.

979
01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:47.450
445...

980
01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:52.752
446.

981
01:23:55.823 --> 01:23:57.658
447...

982
01:24:00.729 --> 01:24:02.432
448...

983
01:24:05.701 --> 01:24:07.635
449...

984
01:24:38.767 --> 01:24:40.833
881.

985
01:24:41.836 --> 01:24:43.671
882.

986
01:24:45.774 --> 01:24:47.543
Okay. Jack.
that's enough for now.

987
01:24:48.178 --> 01:24:50.678
Tell her to stop.
I want you to look out front.

988
01:24:51.113 --> 01:24:52.317
Pam's right there.

989
01:24:52.752 --> 01:24:56.288
I'm gonna come in.

990
01:24:57.324 --> 01:25:00.358
and we're gonna do
the exchange like we agreed.

991
01:25:00.921 --> 01:25:02.129
Okay?

992
01:25:03.528 --> 01:25:04.659
Now. go on.

993
01:25:04.694 --> 01:25:05.825
Tell her to start countin'
again.

994
01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:10.665
- 900. 901. 902.
-

995
01:25:11.635 --> 01:25:18.541
903. 904. 905.

996
01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:26.780
- 906. 907. 908...

Talk to me. Jack.

999
01:25:55.943 --> 01:25:57.712
Where in the fuck is she?

1000
01:26:01.982 --> 01:26:03.256
Deal's off. Jack.

1001
01:26:07.955 --> 01:26:10.824
Frank. the asset
is now expendable.

1002
01:26:28.547 --> 01:26:31.911
Well. I shoulda figured.

1003
01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:38.555
Shannon. I presume?

1004
01:26:40.823 --> 01:26:43.692
Man. you have had
one hell of a day.

1005
01:26:45.597 --> 01:26:47.927
Now we both know
you've done some things

1006
01:26:47.962 --> 01:26:50.930
you probably shouldn't have.
but it's okay.

1007
01:26:51.265 --> 01:26:52.470
I'm here to help ya.

1008
01:26:54.001 --> 01:26:57.343
Frank. why the fuck am I not
hearing a goddamn gunshot?

1009
01:26:58.212 --> 01:27:00.445
Frank's not
available at the moment.

1010
01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.941
Can I help you with somethin'.
Sheriff?

1011
01:27:05.881 --> 01:27:07.518
Jack.
you listen to me. we had a--

1012
01:27:07.553 --> 01:27:11.324
Actually. Hank.
I'd like you to listen.

1013
01:27:11.854 --> 01:27:13.359
Listen to this.

1014
01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:17.495
You hear that?

1015
01:27:19.796 --> 01:27:21.895
That's the sound of justice.

1016
01:27:23.998 --> 01:27:28.638
Um. do you wanna tell me
what on Earth is going on here?

1017
01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.838
It's been a long day.

1018
01:27:33.007 --> 01:27:35.678
You have to trust
your Uncle Jack.

1019
01:27:37.913 --> 01:27:39.286
Copy that.

1020
01:27:42.786 --> 01:27:44.918
-  431.

1021
01:27:45.186 --> 01:27:49.296
432. 433...

1022
01:27:54.061 --> 01:28:00.472
489. 490. 491...

1023
01:28:01.706 --> 01:28:02.969
520.

1024
01:28:04.544 --> 01:28:06.005
525.

1025
01:28:06.674 --> 01:28:10.614
-

1026
01:28:25.026 --> 01:28:26.630
You son of a...

1027
01:28:30.372 --> 01:28:32.031
Abuse of power comes
as no surprise.

1028
01:28:33.936 --> 01:28:34.902
I know men like you.

1029
01:28:36.037 --> 01:28:38.345
You use people to get
what you want.

1030
01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:40.512
All ego and no accountability.

1031
01:28:41.047 --> 01:28:42.778
But I'm that bitch you
shouldn't have fucked with.

1032
01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:45.550
Yeah?
Let's just see about that.

1033
01:28:55.528 --> 01:28:58.959
-

1034
01:29:06.837 --> 01:29:10.377
and bloodshot eyes

1035
01:29:10.412 --> 01:29:12.973
a last goodbye

1036
01:29:13.175 --> 01:29:16.911
clouded my mind

1037
01:29:16.946 --> 01:29:19.980
the man's gotta die

1038
01:29:22.919 --> 01:29:26.393
the tables turned

1039
01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:35.468
on down the river

1040
01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:38.966
a red-handed sinner

1041
01:29:39.001 --> 01:29:44.037
can't cry out

1042
01:29:44.439 --> 01:29:48.074
down the river

1043
01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:51.649
a finger on the trigger

1044
01:29:51.684 --> 01:29:57.050
to find me

1045
01:29:59.122 --> 01:30:03.628
oh oh oh oh oh

1046
01:30:05.027 --> 01:30:09.128
oh oh oh oh

1047
01:30:11.572 --> 01:30:14.705
oh oh oh oh

1048
01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:17.972
just take me on down

1049
01:30:18.007 --> 01:30:22.108
oh oh oh oh

1050
01:30:41.536 --> 01:30:43.668
There are still many
unanswered questions

1051
01:30:43.703 --> 01:30:45.901
in a long-standing Internal
Affairs investigation

1052
01:30:45.936 --> 01:30:49.102
in Green Shores County as
disgraced Sheriff Hank Rivers

1053
01:30:49.137 --> 01:30:52.138
was found dead this morning
from an apparent suicide

1054
01:30:52.173 --> 01:30:53.447
in his jail cell.

1055
01:30:58.212 --> 01:31:00.014
Oh. Thank you.

1056
01:31:01.149 --> 01:31:02.148
That's very nice.

1057
01:31:03.085 --> 01:31:04.051
Ya know what. Pam?

1058
01:31:04.757 --> 01:31:05.822
You were right.

1059
01:31:06.291 --> 01:31:11.157
A little peace. quiet...
might not be so bad.

1060
01:31:12.732 --> 01:31:14.864
Yeah. you know that whole
peace and quiet thing.

1061
01:31:15.733 --> 01:31:17.867
I'm thinkin' that just might
not be in the cards

1062
01:31:17.902 --> 01:31:18.901
for you. Uncle Jack.

1063
01:31:21.235 --> 01:31:22.509
I'm glad you're here.

1064
01:31:23.011 --> 01:31:24.005
Are you doin' good?

1065
01:31:24.876 --> 01:31:25.875
I'm okay.

1066
01:31:26.811 --> 01:31:29.241
All right. well. I better
go get changed.

1067
01:31:29.276 --> 01:31:32.211
I. uh. got promoted to patrol.

1068
01:31:32.246 --> 01:31:34.114
- Eh.
- It seems some spots opened up.

1069
01:31:35.183 --> 01:31:36.952
You earned it. kiddo.

1070
01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:41.726
-

1071
01:31:43.257 --> 01:31:45.224
You expectin' someone.
Uncle Jack?

1072
01:31:58.272 --> 01:31:59.271
You ready?

1073
01:32:03.915 --> 01:32:05.079
How you been?

1074
01:32:05.114 --> 01:32:06.619
Better than the last
time I saw you.

1075
01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:11.217
You know. there's a whole
other side of this lake

1076
01:32:11.252 --> 01:32:12.185
that I wanna show you.

1077
01:32:13.188 --> 01:32:14.825
Wa--

1078
01:32:15.194 --> 01:32:16.189
What's wrong?

1079
01:32:17.258 --> 01:32:19.599
I left my gun. Let me go get it.

1080
01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:22.965
It's okay.
Hey. I got us covered.

1081
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:23.999
I got this.

1082
01:32:24.804 --> 01:32:26.067
You know what. Shannon.

1083
01:32:28.170 --> 01:32:30.643
your dad would be
pretty damn proud.

1084
01:32:33.043 --> 01:32:34.108
Now let's go.

1085
01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:38.684
and we'll finish what
you started.

1086
01:32:40.347 --> 01:32:42.149
Go say goodbye to him.

1087
01:32:42.987 --> 01:32:44.217
Okay.

1088
01:32:50.357 --> 01:32:54.194
a wanted man

1089
01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:03.742
cold steel bars

1090
01:33:13.021 --> 01:33:17.657
break this bus down

1091
01:33:18.026 --> 01:33:25.027
that I know will never end

1092
01:33:30.331 --> 01:33:34.366
you forever

1093
01:33:34.401 --> 01:33:38.909
criminal dreams

1094
01:33:48.316 --> 01:33:53.220
close together

1095
01:33:53.255 --> 01:33:57.323
criminal dreams

1096
01:34:07.035 --> 01:34:11.007
to pleasure

1097
01:34:11.442 --> 01:34:15.814
criminal dreams

1098
01:34:29.324 --> 01:34:34.030
criminal dreams

1099
01:34:44.705 --> 01:34:48.341
across your face

1100
01:34:48.376 --> 01:34:52.950
my dirty cell

1101
01:34:52.985 --> 01:34:57.053
wounded cries

1102
01:34:58.419 --> 01:35:02.256
I think of you

1103
01:35:02.458 --> 01:35:06.766
rendezvous

1104
01:35:07.635 --> 01:35:14.840
everything that's true

1105
01:35:20.073 --> 01:35:24.476
you forever

1106
01:35:24.511 --> 01:35:29.052
criminal dreams
