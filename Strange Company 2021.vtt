(man sighs)

11
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.833
- [Man] Hey. who are you?

12
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.700
- Do you know what happened?

13
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.940
You mean you didn't see that?

14
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.443
- [Man] See what?

15
00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.183
- There was a big flash of
light. everything went bright.

16
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.240
- I didn't see anything.

17
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.030
- Do you have a TV?

18
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.818
Can we see if there's
anything on the news. please?

19
00:03:16.818 --> 00:03:17.651
- Okay.

20
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.423
Come on.

21
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.223
Are you alone?

22
00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.163
- Yeah. why?

23
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.030
- Can I get you something to drink?

24
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.233
- Sure. sure.

25
00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:13.690
I'm Sasha. by the way.

26
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.540
- [Man] I'm Cole.

27
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.443
- Thanks.

28
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.600
- [Cole] What are you doing way out here?

29
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.250
- I was with my boyfriend.

30
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.983
and then he was gone. he disappeared.

31
00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.523
- I'm sure he's around.

32
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.860
What do you say we go into town?

33
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.230
He probably got lost.

34
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.050
It's pretty easy to do around here.

35
00:04:55.292 --> 00:04:57.106
- Yeah. yeah.

36
00:04:57.106 --> 00:05:00.356
(quiet. pulsing music)

37
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.983
- Sorry about the outhouse.

38
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.757
- Oh. it's all right.

39
00:05:19.757 --> 00:05:21.007
I've been camping before.

40
00:05:29.742 --> 00:05:32.825
- What do you say we call it a night?

41
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.290
I won't try anything. I promise.

42
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.983
- Okay.

43
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.550
- [Cole] You take the
bed. I'll take the couch.

44
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.383
- Are you sure?

45
00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:49.493
- Yeah.

46
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.990
Can I get you anything?

47
00:05:54.056 --> 00:05:55.193
- Just a glass of water.

48
00:05:56.685 --> 00:05:57.852
- [Cole] Okay.

49
00:07:08.214 --> 00:07:10.258
- [Sasha] There you are.

50
00:07:10.258 --> 00:07:11.091
- Morning.

51
00:07:14.023 --> 00:07:15.323
Know what you're thinking.

52
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.720
It's the 2000s. and this guy

53
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.420
still gets his water from a creek.

54
00:07:20.414 --> 00:07:22.464
- (chuckles) I wasn't gonna say anything.

55
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.330
- Just like to enjoy the
simpler things in life.

56
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.650
- I wish my life was simple.

57
00:07:40.212 --> 00:07:42.168
- Would you mind?

58
00:07:42.168 --> 00:07:43.418
- [Sasha] Sure.

59
00:07:48.383 --> 00:07:50.740
- So. I was thinking about
what you said last night.

60
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.990
about the flash of light.

61
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.969
What do you think it was?

62
00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:55.802
- Hey. wait!

63
00:07:55.802 --> 00:07:56.635
- Sasha!

64
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.703
Hey.

65
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.960
What was all that about?

66
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:07.690
- There was a little girl.

67
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.873
- Where?

68
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.593
I'm sorry.

69
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.732
- For what?

70
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.460
- I know you're worried right now.

71
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.450
- First Blake. then this
little girl shows up.

72
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.640
I just don't know what the
hell's going on anymore.

73
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.893
- I don't know about any girl. except you.

74
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.933
But it can't just be the two of us.

75
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.110
Have you read it?

76
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.843
- Parts of it. when I was younger.

77
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.410
- You don't think-

78
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.030
- The rapture?

79
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.863
- Yeah.

80
00:09:15.863 --> 00:09:18.963
- I thought about it.
but everybody's gone.

81
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.520
- I didn't think about that.

82
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.020
I mean. surely we're not the only two

83
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.420
sinning nonbelievers around.

84
00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:34.084
(Cole and Sasha chuckle)

85
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.163
- Blake believes in God.

86
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.230
- [Cole] Yeah. me. too.

87
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.113
- Then where has everybody gone?

88
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.983
- I don't know.

89
00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:54.130
I'm gonna find out. though.

90
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.047
(shimmering music)

91
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.280
- Somebody doesn't get out much.

92
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.480
- Yeah. one of the perks of
working at the factory. I guess.

93
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.123
- Yeah.

94
00:10:16.123 --> 00:10:18.370
- I don't really go into
town unless I have to.

95
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.103
- I don't suppose you get
Chinese delivery out here.

96
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.180
Any cell service. any cell signal yet?

97
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.080
- Nah. it doesn't really work up here.

98
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.630
- What happened to you?

99
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.230
I guess we'll save that for another time.

100
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.163
Look. thanks for letting me stay.

101
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.397
I really appreciate it.

102
00:10:51.397 --> 00:10:52.230
You didn't have to.

103
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.063
- Yeah. I did.

104
00:10:53.063 --> 00:10:55.270
It's nice to have someone to talk to.

105
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.470
even for a little while.

106
00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:05.683
But my people skills could
probably use a little work.

107
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.273
- You're like the Tom
Cruise of cabin dwellers.

108
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.100
- Show me the money.

109
00:11:26.723 --> 00:11:27.556
(Sasha knocks)

110
00:11:27.556 --> 00:11:28.440
Hey.

111
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.060
- Hey.

112
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:35.060
Do you mind if I clean up a little bit?

113
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.543
- [Cole] Yeah. be my guest.

114
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.140
- Do you mind?

115
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:44.973
- Sure.

116
00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.200
I guess I'll see you in the morning.

117
00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.033
- [Sasha] Night.

118
00:12:00.427 --> 00:12:02.060
- Night.

119
00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:07.060
Oh. if you need to. use
the water in the jug.

120
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.450
and. if you have to go-

121
00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.350
- [Sasha] I'll take it outside.

122
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.183
- Yeah.

123
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.280
Oh. also. if you want. I
have a shirt you can use.

124
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.820
Just throwing that out there.

125
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.653
- Thanks.

126
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.833
- All right.

127
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:31.023
Night.

128
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.253
- Hey. can I get that shirt?

129
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.253
- Yeah.

130
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:46.663
- I saw her photo.

131
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.113
She was beautiful.

132
00:13:01.862 --> 00:13:04.362
(Sasha gasps)

133
00:13:05.715 --> 00:13:06.548
You scared me.

134
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.077
I'm Sasha. what's your name?

135
00:13:10.077 --> 00:13:10.910
- Mya.

136
00:13:12.171 --> 00:13:13.004
- Hi. Mya.

137
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.080
What are you doing here?

138
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.457
Do you know what happened?

139
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:22.773
Can you tell me?

140
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.493
Can I trust Cole?

141
00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:32.765
- [Mya] Shh.

142
00:13:32.765 --> 00:13:34.950
(Cole knocks)

143
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.928
- Hey. are you still up?

144
00:13:39.928 --> 00:13:40.883
Sorry to bother you.

145
00:13:41.965 --> 00:13:44.788
- [Sasha] It's all right.

146
00:13:44.788 --> 00:13:46.138
- I thought I heard voices.

147
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.760
- Sometimes I talk in my sleep.

148
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.563
- [Cole] I'm sorry. I didn't
know you were sleeping.

149
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.590
- Oh. it's just late.

150
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.530
- I can't sleep right now.

151
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.013
I don't-

152
00:14:12.138 --> 00:14:13.888
- [Sasha] What is it?

153
00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.343
You can tell me.

154
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.170
- I'll let you get some rest.

155
00:15:09.778 --> 00:15:12.695
(mysterious music)

156
00:15:13.907 --> 00:15:17.083
What are you doing in my house?

157
00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:19.860
(watch clicks)

158
00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.113
- We need to talk. Cole.

159
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.030
- How do you know my name?

160
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.670
- That's unimportant.

161
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.473
Come sit down.

162
00:15:30.551 --> 00:15:31.601
- I'll stand. thanks.

163
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.373
- [Mysterious Man] She's dangerous.

164
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.880
- Sasha?
- Mm hmm.

165
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.673
Her past is clouded in mystery.

166
00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:46.490
- I don't exactly have
the best past. either.

167
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.800
- You need to get rid of
her. before it's too late.

168
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.156
- Get rid of her?

169
00:15:51.156 --> 00:15:52.420
I just met her.

170
00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.290
- You know. your father once-

171
00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.803
- [Cole] Whoa. whoa. you knew my father?

172
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.763
- [Mysterious Man] Yes.

173
00:16:02.372 --> 00:16:04.277
But don't trouble yourself
about that right now.

174
00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:10.793
- Do you know where everyone's gone?

175
00:16:11.674 --> 00:16:15.341
(shimmering. pulsing music)

176
00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.710
- You've been dealt a particularly unique

177
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.053
hand of cards. my friend.

178
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.600
There's nothing I can say to give you

179
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.653
a satisfactory explanation
for what you're going through.

180
00:16:48.081 --> 00:16:49.310
- I just want answers.

181
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.263
- You're gonna have to
figure it out on your own.

182
00:16:52.925 --> 00:16:54.133
and you don't have much time.

183
00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:57.553
- Time for what?

184
00:16:59.629 --> 00:17:01.340
- If you don't get rid of her soon.

185
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.093
everything you know is in
danger of becoming extinct.

186
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.829
- How much time do I have?

187
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:11.933
- A week. maybe less.

188
00:17:13.237 --> 00:17:15.819
(watch clicks)

189
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.492
- [Cole] Hey.

190
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.690
What's your name?

191
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.063
- It's Flynn. but that's not important.

192
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.813
Clock's ticking. Cole.

193
00:17:55.989 --> 00:17:59.220
- Hey. about last-
- Look. I'm-

194
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.053
- Go ahead.

195
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.983
- It's okay.

196
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.100
- Everything's a little off.

197
00:18:14.188 --> 00:18:17.049
I really don't know what's
going on around here.

198
00:18:17.049 --> 00:18:18.137
- You're not the only one.

199
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.200
- See. that's just it.

200
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.630
- What do you mean?

201
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.130
- Do you really think
we're the only ones left?

202
00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.690
- I don't know.

203
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.710
I mean. if so. why us?

204
00:18:37.865 --> 00:18:39.115
- I don't know.

205
00:18:40.993 --> 00:18:45.493
I don't think I'd be very
good for starting over with.

206
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:47.980
- I'm not perfect. either.

207
00:18:49.455 --> 00:18:51.128
- You seem all right to me.

208
00:18:51.128 --> 00:18:52.170
I mean. you're female.

209
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.190
(Sasha snorts)

210
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.723
- I'm no Eve. but I can give it a shot.

211
00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.790
She is the one that tempted Adam.

212
00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.290
- You planning on tempting me?

213
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.683
- Got any forbidden fruit laying around?

214
00:19:12.982 --> 00:19:15.482
(Sasha sighs)

215
00:19:20.865 --> 00:19:21.865
- I'm sorry.

216
00:19:23.132 --> 00:19:24.370
- What do you mean?

217
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.140
- I couldn't help but notice you're upset.

218
00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.677
I'm on my way inside. on my own.

219
00:19:30.471 --> 00:19:32.510
I know it's a little lame.
but if you'd like to-

220
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.343
- [Sasha] Sure.

221
00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.310
- Sure what?

222
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.700
- I'll join you.

223
00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.260
- Really?

224
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.540
- I'm here. you're here.

225
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.690
Might as well make the most of it.

226
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:42.523
- Okay.

227
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.123
- I'm Sasha.
- Blake.

228
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:57.710
What happened back there?

229
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.353
- Asshole.

230
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:05.553
- Listen. as guys.
we're wired to be dicks.

231
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.050
It's only through proper
training and conditioning

232
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.625
that we can treat women with respect.

233
00:20:13.625 --> 00:20:16.540
- (chuckles) Is that so?

234
00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.373
- Yeah.

235
00:20:19.971 --> 00:20:20.804
Yeah.

236
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.660
- I thought we really had something.

237
00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.460
- She was your cousin.

238
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.320
- But we really connected.

239
00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.230
- Blood is thicker than water. boys.

240
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.160
At least. that's what they say.

241
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.600
Hit me.

242
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.860
- Saddle up. little doggies.

243
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.481
we's going out on the
open prairie tonight.

244
00:20:37.481 --> 00:20:38.314
(actress laughs)

245
00:20:38.314 --> 00:20:40.180
- How about you. Chuck.
how's your love life?

246
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.970
- Eh. you know. I do all right.

247
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.160
- All right. huh?

248
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.750
- He's dating my best friend Kate.

249
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.770
- When did this happen?
- You knew?

250
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.820
- We're friends. doofus. and we're girls.

251
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.147
We talk.

252
00:20:50.147 --> 00:20:51.090
- You talk. do you. is that what you do?

253
00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.310
And what do you talk about.

254
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.543
other than my scorching good looks.

255
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.170
- Just girl stuff.

256
00:20:58.170 --> 00:20:59.350
- Beer. boobs. and football?

257
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.800
- You guessed it. Mikey.
- Whose boobs?

258
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.780
- Can we please stay
on the matter at hand?

259
00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.770
- And what matter is that?

260
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:04.780
- Kate!

261
00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.950
What did she say about me?

262
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:06.783
- Hit me.

263
00:21:23.444 --> 00:21:24.444
- Oh. did I?

264
00:21:26.908 --> 00:21:28.158
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

265
00:21:29.042 --> 00:21:29.875
- [Sasha] It's all right.

266
00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:30.710
Let's get outta here.

267
00:21:31.579 --> 00:21:32.412
- Yeah.

268
00:21:40.335 --> 00:21:43.252
(screeching tones)

269
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.923
(echoing. distorted voice)

270
00:21:58.937 --> 00:22:00.690
- [Radio Voice] If anyone
can hear this message.

271
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:04.582
you are (speaker collapses
into distortion).

272
00:22:04.582 --> 00:22:06.201
If anyone can hear this message.

273
00:22:06.201 --> 00:22:11.201
you are not alone (speaker
collapses into distortion).

274
00:22:37.518 --> 00:22:40.018
(Sasha sighs)

275
00:22:40.951 --> 00:22:43.151
(Sasha gasps)

276
00:22:43.151 --> 00:22:44.530
- Why do you keep doing that?

277
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.113
- You startle easily.

278
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.013
- You knew this was the end
of the world. didn't you?

279
00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.690
Why didn't you tell me?

280
00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.283
- [Mya] Look. we need to go.

281
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.303
- Where?

282
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.363
Cole's the only one around.

283
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.080
Don't you think it's better
if we stick together?

284
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:20.649
(Sasha sighs)

285
00:23:33.827 --> 00:23:36.244
(Cole sighs)

286
00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.180
- Glad to have you back.

287
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:47.080
- I'm sorry about last night.

288
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.190
- You're free to leave whenever you want.

289
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.353
It's not a prison here.

290
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.873
- I know. it's-
- It's fine.

291
00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.690
- It's not like me to just take
off without saying goodbye.

292
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.860
- So. is that was this is?

293
00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.100
Maybe we should go our own separate ways.

294
00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:10.280
for a little while.

295
00:24:15.439 --> 00:24:17.500
- What are you doing?

296
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.293
- Losing what's left of my sanity.

297
00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:21.810
- Why do you have all these?

298
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:28.780
You're not one of those

299
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.433
end of the world type creeps. are you?

300
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:36.590
- No. actually. I haven't
even read half of these books.

301
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.270
Besides. I don't even own a bomb shelter.

302
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.730
I'm pretty sure that's a requirement.

303
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.963
- Yeah. (chuckles)

304
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.790
- I'll let you know if I find anything.

305
00:24:52.265 --> 00:24:54.932
(water gurgles)

306
00:25:05.289 --> 00:25:07.872
(woman grunts)

307
00:25:13.643 --> 00:25:16.310
(static hisses)

308
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.010
(Cole sighs)

309
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.690
- You're pathetic.

310
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.483
You've really let yourself go.

311
00:25:32.609 --> 00:25:35.550
You're (stutters) pathetic.

312
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:38.903
You have really let
yourself (stutters) go.

313
00:25:40.963 --> 00:25:41.796
- Mom?

314
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:44.720
- Don't give me that!

315
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.060
Is this how you wanna spend
the rest of your life.

316
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.243
or what's left of it?

317
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.400
- I don't know what to do.

318
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.700
Things haven't been the same since-

319
00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.786
- So you decided to just waste away.

320
00:25:58.786 --> 00:25:59.950
- Well. I don't even
know if there's a world

321
00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.983
for me to be part of anymore.

322
00:26:01.983 --> 00:26:03.210
- God!
- I mean. for all I know.

323
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:04.750
I'm the last man on earth.

324
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.730
- Oh. well. what about
that (stutters) girl

325
00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:08.190
you've been spending so much time with?

326
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:09.023
- Sasha.

327
00:26:09.023 --> 00:26:10.240
- Tramp.

328
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.230
- She's not a tramp. she's
just as confused as I am.

329
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.440
- No one will ever be as confused as you.

330
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.133
- I devoted my life to you!

331
00:26:19.241 --> 00:26:22.503
- (stutters) Whatever
helps you sleep at night.

332
00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.498
- This is the end of the world. and you.

333
00:26:26.498 --> 00:26:29.586
(static hisses)

334
00:26:29.586 --> 00:26:30.442
You're dead.

335
00:26:30.442 --> 00:26:33.109
(static hisses)

336
00:26:49.186 --> 00:26:51.436
What the hell am I missing?

337
00:27:16.088 --> 00:27:16.921
Candace?

338
00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:48.204
Did you do what you need to?

339
00:27:49.452 --> 00:27:50.285
- Yeah.

340
00:27:54.913 --> 00:27:57.273
What if we are the last people on Earth?

341
00:28:01.344 --> 00:28:02.594
- I don't know.

342
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:05.703
Repopulate?

343
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.993
- You would like that. wouldn't you?

344
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:17.140
You are totally into me. aren't you?

345
00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.580
- I've seen better.

346
00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.813
- Oh. better. huh?

347
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:22.850
Do you see any better around here?

348
00:28:24.698 --> 00:28:26.398
- I don't see anybody around here.

349
00:28:27.329 --> 00:28:28.603
- [Sasha] That's what I thought.

350
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:33.610
- So where'd you go?

351
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.240
It's all right. you don't have to say it.

352
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.363
- It's just things have
been so strange lately.

353
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.980
- You mean besides the apocalypse?

354
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:53.410
There's been a lot of other weird stuff

355
00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:54.460
going on around here.

356
00:28:56.114 --> 00:28:57.781
- [Sasha] Weird how?

357
00:28:59.275 --> 00:29:02.942
- Well. I had an argument
with my dead wife.

358
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.900
and I also had a
conversation with my mother.

359
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.923
who is also dead.

360
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:10.103
- Really.

361
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.040
- I've also been seeing this guy Flynn.

362
00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:16.383
- Who's he?

363
00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:22.763
- [Cole] What is it?

364
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.013
- Nothing.

365
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.560
- Please. tell me I'm not going crazy.

366
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:35.783
- Better prep the padded
room. reservation for two.

367
00:29:40.372 --> 00:29:41.205
- Come on.

368
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.430
- No offense. but those clothes

369
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.180
look like they've seen better days.

370
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.340
- They're all I have.

371
00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.160
- Still have some of my
wife's clothes in the closet.

372
00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.600
- [Sasha] Oh. you don't have to.

373
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.433
- It's okay.

374
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.430
She has no need for them anymore.

375
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.763
so you're welcome to help yourself.

376
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:16.743
- Thank you.

377
00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.537
What do you think?

378
00:30:31.379 --> 00:30:33.020
- You look good.

379
00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.170
- [Sasha] Yeah. I know.

380
00:30:43.047 --> 00:30:45.640
- I'm glad you decided to come back.

381
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.473
- Yeah. me. too.

382
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.570
I know it's none of my business.

383
00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:00.270
but why haven't you. you
know. gotten back out there?

384
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.610
- When you meet someone
who just really takes

385
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:13.473
your breath away.

386
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.943
- Well. what happened. if
you don't mind me asking?

387
00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.673
- She was out collecting
water from the creek.

388
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:27.850
the way she did every morning.

389
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.563
She loves being outdoors.

390
00:31:35.808 --> 00:31:36.770
(woman grunts)

391
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.793
Something just felt wrong.

392
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.280
So I went out to go check on her.

393
00:31:44.646 --> 00:31:47.146
(quiet music)

394
00:31:56.787 --> 00:31:59.204
(Cole weeps)

395
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:09.053
- I'm so sorry.

396
00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.990
- Her ring was laying nearby.

397
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.070
- It's all right.

398
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.623
I'm here. love.

399
00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.713
What is it?

400
00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.127
- Nothing. it's just
something she used to say.

401
00:32:30.788 --> 00:32:31.621
- Oh.

402
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:37.063
- What is this?

403
00:32:42.328 --> 00:32:43.911
- Hey. what's that?

404
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:46.893
- Looks like she was writing a book.

405
00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.670
- You should probably respect her privacy.

406
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:50.923
- I have to read that.

407
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.600
- She wouldn't want you
thumbing through her things.

408
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.380
- Well. why wouldn't she tell me about it?

409
00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.250
- Everybody has secrets. Cole.

410
00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.043
Some things are better left alone.

411
00:33:10.275 --> 00:33:13.192
(shimmering music)

412
00:33:19.117 --> 00:33:20.360
- [Flynn] What did I
tell you about the girl?

413
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.253
- Jeez.

414
00:33:22.617 --> 00:33:23.910
- [Flynn] Well?

415
00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.130
- Yeah. I know what you said.

416
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.000
it's just-
- You like her.

417
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.760
- There might be something to her.

418
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.260
- Yeah.

419
00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.943
She's gorgeous. possibly the
last woman on the planet.

420
00:33:39.158 --> 00:33:40.325
and. you know.

421
00:33:42.831 --> 00:33:43.664
- And what?

422
00:33:43.664 --> 00:33:45.263
- And she reminds you of?

423
00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.520
- No.

424
00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.120
- [Flynn] You miss her?

425
00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.310
- Of course I miss her.
but Sasha's not even-

426
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.880
- There's things you
still don't understand.

427
00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.030
- There's a hell of a
lot I don't understand.

428
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.980
Women are just one of those things.

429
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.420
- Cole. there's forces
working against you.

430
00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.330
- Why are you even here.

431
00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:08.960
There's no way that you can be real.

432
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.862
- What's reality?

433
00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.290
- [Cole] Why are we talking philosophy?

434
00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:17.103
- If your brain thinks
something is real. it's real.

435
00:34:18.053 --> 00:34:20.389
(Cole sighs)

436
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:23.040
- My brain tells me there
is no way that you're real.

437
00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.889
But here we are. carrying on

438
00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:27.889
like two characters in a bad soap opera.

439
00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:31.730
Are you real or not?

440
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.306
- You decide.

441
00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:38.327
(fluttering music)

442
00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:41.263
- Flynn?

443
00:34:45.245 --> 00:34:46.078
Flynn?

444
00:34:48.926 --> 00:34:51.342
(Cole sighs)

445
00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.040
- My God. are you okay?

446
00:34:59.040 --> 00:34:59.990
- [Cole] I'll live.

447
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.483
- What happened?

448
00:35:05.754 --> 00:35:08.054
- I thought I saw my
wife's ring in the creek.

449
00:35:09.033 --> 00:35:10.228
- So you dove in?

450
00:35:10.228 --> 00:35:12.145
- [Cole] No. I slipped.

451
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:14.659
- Let's get you cleaned up.

452
00:35:14.659 --> 00:35:15.905
Let's get a shower.

453
00:35:15.905 --> 00:35:19.322
(gentle. haunting music)

454
00:36:24.423 --> 00:36:26.150
That's a new look.

455
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.700
- Well. it's time for a change.

456
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:36.047
What are we gonna do
with the rest of our day?

457
00:36:38.569 --> 00:36:39.969
- We could just stay in bed.

458
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:44.040
- [Cole] You're something
else. you know that?

459
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.873
- Oh. I know.

460
00:36:49.663 --> 00:36:50.713
(gasps) Blake!

461
00:36:52.372 --> 00:36:53.930
- What's wrong. baby?

462
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:56.170
- What are you doing here?

463
00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:58.270
- Rocking your world. if I'm not mistaken.

464
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.780
What are you doing with this loser?

465
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:04.743
- [Sasha] Cole?

466
00:37:05.802 --> 00:37:07.553
- How many guys are you sleeping with?

467
00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:14.295
You know. I never would've
pegged you for a cheater.

468
00:37:14.295 --> 00:37:15.760
- That's not fair!
- No. what's not fair

469
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.660
is you don't whether or
not I'm dead or alive.

470
00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.690
and. yet. here you are banging this idiot.

471
00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:21.200
- You disappeared!

472
00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.033
- How do you know I just didn't go

473
00:37:22.033 --> 00:37:24.150
down to the pub. get shit-faced.

474
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.364
and end up in the gutter
for a couple of days?

475
00:37:26.364 --> 00:37:28.401
- I don't know what you want me to say.

476
00:37:28.401 --> 00:37:29.560
- No. you know what?

477
00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.560
I see where I stand.

478
00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:32.913
- Wait. Blake!

479
00:37:38.879 --> 00:37:40.879
- Did you say something?

480
00:37:42.127 --> 00:37:43.577
- No. I was talking out loud.

481
00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.493
- Okay.

482
00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.983
Wanna try heading out to the pub?

483
00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.310
- Yeah. I'll get dressed.

484
00:37:59.464 --> 00:38:00.464
- All right.

485
00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:06.160
- You think we're gonna
find anything in there?

486
00:38:08.575 --> 00:38:10.075
It's worth a shot.

487
00:38:11.354 --> 00:38:13.096
- At the very least.
we can get some drinks.

488
00:38:13.096 --> 00:38:14.429
- Oh. hell yeah.

489
00:38:24.088 --> 00:38:26.525
- Are you good at pool?

490
00:38:26.525 --> 00:38:28.358
- I can kick your ass.

491
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.720
- I need to hit the head.

492
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.387
Where do you think the bathroom's at?

493
00:38:33.387 --> 00:38:35.100
Follow the signs. okay.

494
00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.850
(Sasha chuckles)

495
00:38:39.563 --> 00:38:41.280
Oh. here we go.

496
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.977
I'll go this way. and you go that way.

497
00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.873
(urine splatters)

498
00:39:07.342 --> 00:39:12.342
(bluesy rock music)
(people chattering)

499
00:39:21.773 --> 00:39:23.440
Are you seeing this?

500
00:39:25.064 --> 00:39:25.897
- Uh huh.

501
00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.193
I was not expecting people.

502
00:39:36.828 --> 00:39:38.078
- Let's mingle.

503
00:39:42.169 --> 00:39:44.669
(balls clack)

504
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.667
- Hey. bud.

505
00:39:48.667 --> 00:39:49.599
- Me?

506
00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:50.651
- [Blake] Come here.

507
00:39:50.651 --> 00:39:53.651
(bluesy rock music)

508
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:57.182
- Thanks.

509
00:40:01.324 --> 00:40:02.737
Do I know you?

510
00:40:02.737 --> 00:40:05.250
- Nah. man. you don't know me.

511
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.300
but maybe you should.

512
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.273
- Okay.

513
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:12.773
- Drink up.

514
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:15.453
But I know you.

515
00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:17.910
You're the apocalypse guy.

516
00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.330
- So you're not real. either?

517
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.220
- Perception is reality.

518
00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.190
Everyone knows that.

519
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.040
- [Cole] Okay. are you the Riddler or?

520
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.493
- No. man. no. I'm not the Riddler.

521
00:40:32.634 --> 00:40:33.467
I'm Blake.

522
00:40:34.586 --> 00:40:36.150
- Hi. Blake.

523
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:37.143
- Sasha's Blake.

524
00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.293
- Oh.

525
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:43.510
Well. hey. she's around here.

526
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:44.650
I'm sure she'd be really happy-

527
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.820
- It's not her I'm interested in.

528
00:40:49.193 --> 00:40:50.026
- Oh.

529
00:40:51.485 --> 00:40:53.318
What can I do for you?

530
00:40:55.575 --> 00:40:57.535
- You can stay the hell away from my girl.

531
00:40:57.535 --> 00:40:59.200
- Look. I didn't know that she was-

532
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.300
- I know what you did.

533
00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.750
- Okay.

534
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.883
No offense. but as far as I can tell.

535
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.263
she's the only one who's
real in here. besides me.

536
00:41:14.635 --> 00:41:15.770
Thanks for the drink.

537
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:16.603
- Keep it real.

538
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:22.730
(people chattering)
(bluesy rock music)

539
00:41:29.914 --> 00:41:31.736
- What did I tell you about the girl?

540
00:41:31.736 --> 00:41:34.488
- I know. I know.

541
00:41:34.488 --> 00:41:36.405
- You're not listening.

542
00:41:38.531 --> 00:41:39.366
She's coming.

543
00:41:39.366 --> 00:41:42.533
(pounding rock music)

544
00:41:43.665 --> 00:41:46.147
- Who's your friend?

545
00:41:46.147 --> 00:41:47.589
I'm Sasha.

546
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:50.756
(pounding rock music)

547
00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:08.352
What the hell is his problem?

548
00:42:08.352 --> 00:42:09.185
- He's a comic.

549
00:42:09.185 --> 00:42:12.352
(pounding rock music)

550
00:42:13.737 --> 00:42:16.654
Find anyone interesting to talk to?

551
00:42:18.573 --> 00:42:20.353
- Just one of my imaginary friends.

552
00:42:20.353 --> 00:42:23.520
(pounding rock music)

553
00:42:26.131 --> 00:42:29.376
- We should probably head back.

554
00:42:29.376 --> 00:42:32.503
- Cole. we might not get
another chance like this.

555
00:42:32.503 --> 00:42:35.103
(pounding rock music)

556
00:42:35.103 --> 00:42:36.092
- Let's go.

557
00:42:36.092 --> 00:42:39.259
(pounding rock music)

558
00:42:41.481 --> 00:42:42.314
- Blake!

559
00:42:44.057 --> 00:42:46.640
(Cole retches)

560
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:55.730
(quiet music)

561
00:43:15.155 --> 00:43:16.405
How ya feeling?

562
00:43:17.587 --> 00:43:18.683
- How do I look?

563
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:20.870
- [Sasha] Like shit.

564
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.737
I talked to him. you know.

565
00:43:32.737 --> 00:43:34.543
- And you didn't say anything?

566
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:40.200
- I didn't know who he was. at first.

567
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.780
(Sasha sighs)

568
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.023
He's not real. you know.

569
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.563
- How do we even know what's real anymore?

570
00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.150
- What if they're just
distracting us from-

571
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:56.400
- What. from what we're
supposed to be doing?

572
00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.013
- Yeah

573
00:43:59.013 --> 00:44:00.423
- What are we supposed to be doing?

574
00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:08.770
- I'm reading that book.

575
00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:12.680
- What book?

576
00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.880
- [Cole] Candace's book.

577
00:44:23.154 --> 00:44:24.090
- What do you think you're doing?

578
00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:25.620
- Trying to find out
what's so damn important

579
00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.420
she didn't want me to know about it.

580
00:44:37.388 --> 00:44:38.477
"They lived in a quaint cabin in the woods

581
00:44:38.477 --> 00:44:40.994
"outside a small Colorado town.

582
00:44:40.994 --> 00:44:42.967
"A soft flowing creek ran
behind their loving home.

583
00:44:42.967 --> 00:44:44.367
"and provided the perfect backdrop

584
00:44:44.367 --> 00:44:45.837
"for what they hoped would one day be home

585
00:44:45.837 --> 00:44:47.307
"to their future children."

586
00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.370
Is this about us?

587
00:44:59.367 --> 00:45:00.563
"Sasha knew."

588
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:02.483
Sasha?

589
00:45:04.157 --> 00:45:06.637
"Sasha knew she could never
tell him what happened.

590
00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:08.097
"He would be crushed.

591
00:45:08.097 --> 00:45:09.517
"Blake had always wanted a child.

592
00:45:09.517 --> 00:45:11.217
"and the loss would devastate him.

593
00:45:14.147 --> 00:45:16.217
"Several years passed.
but she never told him

594
00:45:16.217 --> 00:45:17.853
"about the miscarriage.

595
00:45:19.117 --> 00:45:21.227
"Their love had been the
one constant in their lives.

596
00:45:21.227 --> 00:45:24.397
"and she didn't wanna do
anything to put that in jeopardy.

597
00:45:24.397 --> 00:45:26.617
"Maybe one day they would
know the love of a child.

598
00:45:26.617 --> 00:45:29.837
"but Mya. she was her secret."

599
00:45:37.436 --> 00:45:39.329
(book bangs)

600
00:45:39.329 --> 00:45:40.429
What the hell is this?

601
00:45:42.024 --> 00:45:43.670
- [Sasha] (sighs) I
told you not to read it.

602
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:45.303
- Why are you in this book?

603
00:45:46.406 --> 00:45:48.569
(Sasha sighs)

604
00:45:48.569 --> 00:45:50.183
- We knew you wouldn't understand.

605
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:52.873
- We?

606
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:55.140
- I'm leaving.

607
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.900
I can't stand to watch this
train wreck any longer.

608
00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:58.733
- Wait. Sasha!

609
00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.810
Sasha!

610
00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:03.883
Sasha. where are you going?

611
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:07.733
- I shouldn't have come back.

612
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:10.653
Just leave me alone.

613
00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:41.903
- Dad?

614
00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.160
What are you doing here?

615
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.113
- You need to quit worrying

616
00:46:51.113 --> 00:46:52.680
about what other people are doing.

617
00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.773
and start thinking about
what you need to do.

618
00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:57.470
- [Cole] Which is what?

619
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:59.240
- It's time for you to make a choice.

620
00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.100
- What choice?

621
00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:01.933
Dad.

622
00:47:02.989 --> 00:47:05.739
(dramatic music)

623
00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.114
Are you Mya?

624
00:47:17.114 --> 00:47:19.864
(dramatic music)

625
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:38.403
My father blamed me.

626
00:47:40.355 --> 00:47:43.236
He climbed into a bottle.
and he never looked back.

627
00:47:43.236 --> 00:47:45.986
(dramatic music)

628
00:47:56.581 --> 00:47:58.998
(lush music)

629
00:48:47.629 --> 00:48:49.060
What do you want?

630
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.290
Hey!

631
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:51.373
- Get over yourself.

632
00:48:53.187 --> 00:48:54.830
- [Cole] Can I help you?

633
00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:56.610
Just here to go through all my shit?

634
00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:57.800
- I'm here on business.

635
00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.083
- [Cole] Well. I'm not buying.

636
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.160
- I want my life back.

637
00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.523
You're obviously confused. Cole. as usual.

638
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:09.660
- Why are you even here?

639
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:12.071
Do you wanna borrow
some sugar or something?

640
00:49:12.071 --> 00:49:14.313
- (chuckles) You're funny.

641
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:17.023
Sugar. nah. not sugar.

642
00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:19.323
Blood. maybe.

643
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:21.343
Maybe pain.

644
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:24.923
- [Cole] What are you talking about?

645
00:49:26.794 --> 00:49:28.838
- Was I rambling again?

646
00:49:28.838 --> 00:49:30.500
Maybe there's something in the water.

647
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.833
- Get to the point!

648
00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.400
- Take it easy. I come in peace.

649
00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.700
- Why don't I believe you?

650
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.433
- 'Cause I'm obviously lying.

651
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.063
We're all lying. Cole.

652
00:49:44.185 --> 00:49:45.873
You're just too dumb to figure it out.

653
00:49:45.873 --> 00:49:46.771
- [Cole] Then why don't you tell me

654
00:49:46.771 --> 00:49:48.140
what the hell is going on?

655
00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:50.563
- The answers will come. in time.

656
00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:55.283
And Sasha. she'll come back to you.

657
00:49:55.283 --> 00:49:56.580
- I thought she was your girl.

658
00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:57.780
- [Blake] Things change.

659
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:02.040
- Look. man. I didn't mean to.

660
00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.340
- Woulda. coulda. shoulda.

661
00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:07.533
I'm not here for excuses or apologies.

662
00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:10.585
- [Cole] Then what the hell do you want?

663
00:50:10.585 --> 00:50:13.085
(fist smacks)

664
00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:18.130
- Don't make the same mistakes I did.

665
00:51:02.765 --> 00:51:06.098
(tense. exciting music)

666
00:51:43.307 --> 00:51:44.943
- What in the hell is
going on around here?

667
00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:47.780
- Let's go stretch your legs.

668
00:51:54.858 --> 00:51:55.783
- [Cole] I saw my mom.

669
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:58.440
- [Flynn] She's around.

670
00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.050
- I had a daughter.

671
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:05.003
I've been feeling terrible.

672
00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.790
- Well. that's to be expected.

673
00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:10.980
- Really?

674
00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.163
- Look. I'm not here to
answer your questions.

675
00:52:15.024 --> 00:52:17.050
- Then why are you here?

676
00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:18.313
- That's not important.

677
00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.733
What is important is this.

678
00:52:22.594 --> 00:52:23.540
- [Cole] What do you know about this?

679
00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.560
- There's nothing but trouble in there.

680
00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.110
You best get rid of it now
while you still have a chance.

681
00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:29.330
- [Cole] I had a daughter.

682
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:31.680
- Heed my warning. son.

683
00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.290
That book is dangerous.

684
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:35.370
It'll only hold you back.

685
00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:36.920
and you're running out of time.

686
00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:41.100
I'm afraid this is farewell.

687
00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:43.727
Good luck. I'll be rooting for you.

688
00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:57.413
- What now?

689
00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:01.051
The hell's your problem?

690
00:53:01.051 --> 00:53:02.710
- You know what they
say. if I can't have her.

691
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:03.610
- You're not real.

692
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:06.367
- [Blake] That real enough for you?

693
00:53:06.367 --> 00:53:07.804
(Cole groans)

694
00:53:07.804 --> 00:53:08.637
There ain't room enough in the world

695
00:53:08.637 --> 00:53:09.680
for the both of us. friend.

696
00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:12.080
- What the hell do you want?

697
00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:14.942
- Face it. Cole. you're all alone.

698
00:53:14.942 --> 00:53:17.442
(Cole grunts)

699
00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:24.843
- Still reading those books?

700
00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:27.653
- They're actually pretty fascinating.

701
00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.020
- This laundry is fascinating.

702
00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:33.200
- You know. one day. we'll have some kids.

703
00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.400
and then we can make
them do all the chores.

704
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:38.710
- Is that why you wanna have kids?

705
00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:43.570
- I wanna have kids because I love you.

706
00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.533
and I want some little rascals
to share that love with.

707
00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:49.720
- [Candace] Good answer.

708
00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.820
- What do you say we start trying?

709
00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:53.653
- Now?

710
00:53:54.712 --> 00:53:56.040
What about the laundry?

711
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:56.873
- It can wait.

712
00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:17.940
I used to think about what I
would do if I ever lost you.

713
00:54:23.142 --> 00:54:25.920
I'm talking to people that can't be real.

714
00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.683
sleeping with women who aren't you.

715
00:54:31.232 --> 00:54:32.903
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

716
00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:36.740
But I gotta do something.

717
00:54:42.757 --> 00:54:45.424
(Cole sniffles)

718
00:54:47.907 --> 00:54:49.587
"Blake leaned over to Sasha and whispered

719
00:54:49.587 --> 00:54:50.927
"sweetly into her ear."

720
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:54.630
What the hell are you trying to tell me?

721
00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:56.943
You're not real.

722
00:54:58.669 --> 00:55:00.330
- [Blake] Don't you see. farm boy?

723
00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:01.520
- See what?

724
00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.943
- You'll never defeat
me 'cause you are me.

725
00:55:06.806 --> 00:55:09.139
(men grunt)

726
00:55:17.562 --> 00:55:20.562
- No. no. come on. come on. come on.

727
00:55:23.358 --> 00:55:26.276
(Cole weeps)

728
00:55:26.276 --> 00:55:28.206
You're all I have left.

729
00:55:28.206 --> 00:55:30.623
(Cole pants)

730
00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:43.293
Candace?

731
00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:49.800
I don't understand.

732
00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:52.670
- Come with me. Cole.

733
00:55:55.557 --> 00:55:58.140
(gentle music)

734
00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:03.330
- What's happening?

735
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.150
- There's something in the water.

736
00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:08.530
- What do you mean?

737
00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:11.660
- It's affecting you.

738
00:56:16.727 --> 00:56:18.894
You have to make a choice.

739
00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:23.343
- You or Sasha.

740
00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.063
- No. the truth or.

741
00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:29.923
- The lie.

742
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:38.960
I'm having such a good time with you.

743
00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.210
but I know it's not real.

744
00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:47.283
Am I the last man on Earth?

745
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:50.943
- [Candace] Is that
what's important to you?

746
00:56:57.637 --> 00:57:01.773
- What about Sasha. the book?

747
00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:08.003
- It was too personal
to use our real names.

748
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:12.450
- Blake said...

749
00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:18.363
Theater.

750
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:39.743
I'm sorry.

751
00:57:41.925 --> 00:57:43.540
- What do you mean?

752
00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.583
- I couldn't help but notice you're upset.

753
00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.363
I'm on my way in. all by myself.

754
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.250
I know it's kinda lame.
but I was wondering-

755
00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:01.083
- Sure.

756
00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:04.610
- Sure what?

757
00:58:04.610 --> 00:58:05.783
- [Candace] I'll join you.

758
00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:07.923
- Really?

759
00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.410
- [Candace] I'm here. you're here.

760
00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:13.110
might as well make the most of it.

761
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:15.376
- Okay.

762
00:58:15.376 --> 00:58:17.876
(quiet music)

763
00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:31.940
That was the best day of my life.

764
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.713
- Mine. too.

765
00:58:37.053 --> 00:58:39.257
- What about Flynn?

766
00:58:39.257 --> 00:58:41.567
- You don't remember?

767
00:58:41.567 --> 00:58:44.817
(gentle. solemn music)

768
00:58:54.991 --> 00:58:55.824
Cole?

769
00:59:02.577 --> 00:59:04.577
- [Cole] Can I help you?

770
00:59:05.705 --> 00:59:07.372
- Boy. you've grown.

771
00:59:08.414 --> 00:59:09.764
- I'm sorry. do I know you?

772
00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:14.730
- Last time I saw you. you were
knee-high to a grasshopper.

773
00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.420
My name's Flynn. but that's not important.

774
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.450
I'm an old friend of your father's.

775
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.380
- My father doesn't live here.

776
00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:26.213
- Yeah.

777
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:31.620
Look. I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you this.

778
00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.233
but your dad passed away.

779
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.513
I know you weren't close.

780
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:47.980
- Do you know what happened?

781
00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:53.720
- He was drinking.

782
00:59:56.410 --> 00:59:58.023
like he often did. you know.

783
01:00:00.875 --> 01:00:03.390
(gun clicks)

784
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:06.140
(father panting)

785
01:00:09.269 --> 01:00:11.602
(gun bangs)

786
01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.953
Well. I'm sorry you
had to hear it from me.

787
01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:25.640
I'll be on my way.

788
01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:32.400
- Hey. thanks for letting me know.

789
01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:36.910
- No problem. kid.

790
01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:39.600
See you around.

791
01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.973
- That was a hard day.

792
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:01.743
- Yeah.

793
01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:07.950
Why are all these visions. these people.

794
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:12.950
trying to keep Sasha. us. us.

795
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:16.720
why are they trying to keep us apart?

796
01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.200
- Part of you would want to keep

797
01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.793
the illusion alive forever.

798
01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.550
but your body can't take
much more of the poison.

799
01:01:27.594 --> 01:01:30.094
(Cole coughs)

800
01:01:39.189 --> 01:01:40.023
- I'm not ready.

801
01:01:40.023 --> 01:01:42.856
(emotional music)

802
01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:56.245
I still have so much...

803
01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:59.078
(emotional music)

804
01:02:08.679 --> 01:02:09.981
I still have so much.

805
01:02:09.981 --> 01:02:12.814
(emotional music)

806
01:03:12.965 --> 01:03:15.548
(Cole retches)

807
01:03:17.905 --> 01:03:20.738
(emotional music)

808
01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:43.360
- [Man Voiceover] This is Gunter Harrison.

809
01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.239
We have regained radio signal.

810
01:04:45.239 --> 01:04:47.590
I repeat. we are back on the air.

811
01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:51.030
If anyone can hear this
message. you are not alone.

812
01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:52.715
There are others.

813
01:04:52.715 --> 01:04:55.847
We are gathering in the
small town of Black Hawk.

814
01:04:55.847 --> 01:04:57.950
We have food and fresh water.

815
01:04:57.950 --> 01:05:00.240
I urge you to leave the
comfort of your homes.

816
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.811
make your way to Black
Hawk as quickly as you can.

817
01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:06.613
and. whatever you do. do
not trust the strangers.

818
01:05:06.613 --> 01:05:09.696
I repeat. do not trust the strangers.

819
01:05:10.546 --> 01:05:14.129
(haunting. ethereal music)
