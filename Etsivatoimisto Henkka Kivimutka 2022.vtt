HENKKA & KIVIMUTKA

5
00:01:54.874 --> 00:01:57.040
<i>Hi. I'm Henkka.</i>

6
00:01:57.041 --> 00:02:01.291
<i>In the background you see Lahti.
This is a pretty "spot place".</i>

7
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:05.499
<i>Dad said that some hero
said so a long time ago.</i>

8
00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:07.540
<i>Pretty well put. if you ask me.</i>

9
00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:09.332
<i>But yeah... Let's move on.</i>

10
00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:03.124
Henkka. Henkka. Henri Virtanen!

11
00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:07.582
Get your backpack.
You're going to be late.

12
00:03:07.582 --> 00:03:10.457
Hurry up now.
-Yeah. yeah.

13
00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.582
Bye now.
-Did you forget something?

14
00:03:58.666 --> 00:03:59.457
Over there.

15
00:04:07.374 --> 00:04:10.415
<i>This is my mother. She's alright.</i>

16
00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.874
<i>But from time to time
she has a nervous breakdown.</i>

17
00:04:12.874 --> 00:04:17.374
<i>I've never seen a nerve break down.
but it must be some mother-thing.</i>

18
00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:26.290
Oh no.

19
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:30.791
<i>This weirdly jerking creature
is my bus driver. I mean my dad.</i>

20
00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:34.249
<i>He drives a bus
that must have at least two decks.</i>

21
00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:38.749
<i>He likes to tickle everyone.
It's kind of embarrassing...</i>

22
00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.249
<i>I mean I don't think he tickles
the passengers.</i>

23
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:51.999
<i>Though he probably would like to.</i>

24
00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:55.374
Tickets. please. Thank you.

25
00:04:56.541 --> 00:04:58.124
Have a nice day at school.

26
00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:07.874
Remember to do your homework
right after school.

27
00:05:11.707 --> 00:05:13.957
Bye now!
-Let's go.

28
00:05:17.874 --> 00:05:21.457
<i>I feel that the grown ups</i>

29
00:05:21.457 --> 00:05:24.790
<i>Don't always understand my world</i>

30
00:05:25.916 --> 00:05:29.332
<i>They just rush me to school</i>

31
00:05:29.332 --> 00:05:32.582
<i>Even though it would be more cool</i>

32
00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:37.082
<i>To learn from this town</i>

33
00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:50.041
<i>Walking along Pumpputie way
Nothing takes my focus away</i>

34
00:05:50.832 --> 00:05:54.998
<i>I notice something wild
A fate most vile</i>

35
00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:56.999
<i>My little cat has vanished</i>

36
00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:08.541
<i>This mission can be completed</i>

37
00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:14.290
<i>Detective agency is on the case</i>

38
00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:21.249
<i>To school I make my way
Nothing takes my focus away</i>

39
00:06:22.374 --> 00:06:26.082
<i>I notice something
over there is wrong</i>

40
00:06:26.082 --> 00:06:29.790
I lost my wallet yesterday.
-But the fare needs to be paid.

41
00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:33.207
<i>This mission can be completed</i>

42
00:06:35.707 --> 00:06:39.415
<i>Detective agency is on the case!</i>
-There is nothing in here!

43
00:06:49.124 --> 00:06:52.332
<i>Detective is on the case</i>

44
00:06:52.332 --> 00:06:54.290
<i>Detective is on the case</i>

45
00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:56.707
<i>Detective is on the case</i>

46
00:06:56.707 --> 00:07:01.207
<i>Walking along this way
Nothing takes my focus away</i>

47
00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:07.999
<i>I notice a new opportunity
To make this a good day</i>

48
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:14.416
<i>This mission can be completed</i>

49
00:07:17.082 --> 00:07:21.582
<i>Detective from detective agency
is on the case</i>

50
00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:32.249
<i>Is on the case</i>

51
00:07:56.082 --> 00:07:58.832
Hi. Are you ok?

52
00:07:58.832 --> 00:08:03.332
Hi there. I'm fine.
I just came to see this tree.

53
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.874
Have a nice day.

54
00:08:09.707 --> 00:08:11.790
<i>Lahti is full of funny folks.</i>

55
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:14.999
<i>and there's always something
odd and exciting going on.</i>

56
00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:18.999
<i>Like now.</i>

57
00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:36.749
Blood.

58
00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:08.999
<i>This is my best friend Kivimutka.
First name is...</i>

59
00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:11.457
<i>Jorma-Kalevi.</i>

60
00:09:11.457 --> 00:09:15.957
<i>Also known as Jiikoo. We are
Detective agency Henkka & Kivimutka.</i>

61
00:09:17.332 --> 00:09:18.873
Look.

62
00:09:18.874 --> 00:09:21.374
Are those long johns?
-No. pantyhose.

63
00:09:22.707 --> 00:09:26.457
There was also an axe
and some blood where I found these.

64
00:09:26.457 --> 00:09:30.457
Yuck! Put them away
before someone sees them...

65
00:09:30.457 --> 00:09:34.373
Something bad has happened
to whoever owns these.

66
00:09:34.374 --> 00:09:38.290
<i>Now Jiikoo is getting it.
You can see it on his face.</i>

67
00:09:38.291 --> 00:09:40.957
<i>Not that face. the one before...</i>

68
00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:44.416
<i>This one. No. I mean...</i>

69
00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:45.999
<i>Argh! Forget it.</i>

70
00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:49.999
Maybe a bank robber wore those.

71
00:09:56.832 --> 00:09:58.915
Or there has been a murder...

72
00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:02.540
<i>Now look at that face!</i>

73
00:10:07.874 --> 00:10:12.374
Spiffing morning!
-Spiffing morning.

74
00:10:13.124 --> 00:10:15.082
This is a wonderful morning.

75
00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:19.332
It is a great pleasure to welcome
a new student to the 5B-team.

76
00:10:19.332 --> 00:10:22.415
May I present. Sisko-Kaarina!

77
00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:29.666
Ok now. Let's welcome Sisko-Kaarina.

78
00:10:30.832 --> 00:10:34.332
Welcome.

79
00:10:34.332 --> 00:10:36.415
Thank you and hi everyone.

80
00:10:36.416 --> 00:10:39.832
That desk there is free.
You can sit down.

81
00:10:40.582 --> 00:10:44.248
Sisko-Kaarina moved here from Stadi.
or Helsinki.

82
00:10:44.249 --> 00:10:47.124
It's the capital of Finland.

83
00:10:47.124 --> 00:10:51.624
I've been there.
There are sights such as...

84
00:10:51.999 --> 00:10:56.499
Finlandia square. art museum Kuisma.
statue of the three hammered men.

85
00:10:57.207 --> 00:11:00.915
And the National Theatre.

86
00:11:20.374 --> 00:11:22.790
Yeah... Like that. Welcome.

87
00:11:23.541 --> 00:11:28.041
And take out the math-math...
-Math books.

88
00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:45.166
Smells wonderful.
-Only the best for the queen.

89
00:11:47.416 --> 00:11:51.916
That's mother. not a queen.
And that groping is yucky.

90
00:11:52.207 --> 00:11:56.165
Why can't mother be a queen?
You call yourself an FBI-man.

91
00:11:56.166 --> 00:11:59.666
It's pronounced Ef-pee-i.

92
00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:03.666
So what is the Ef-pee-i-man doing?

93
00:12:03.666 --> 00:12:06.499
Oh. math.

94
00:12:06.499 --> 00:12:10.999
Yeah. but soon I'm going to dedicate
myself to investigating a murder.

95
00:12:11.624 --> 00:12:15.790
A ten-year-old doesn't yet
have to dedicate to anything.

96
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:18.457
Yeah. but there are crimes all around.

97
00:12:18.457 --> 00:12:21.665
Look. Even these tv-shows have crimes.

98
00:12:21.666 --> 00:12:25.874
"Sherlock Holmes".
"Hercule Poirot". "Columbo"...

99
00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:32.415
How have you been watching these?

100
00:12:37.124 --> 00:12:39.207
I'll go and rake the yard.

101
00:12:40.624 --> 00:12:45.124
Well yes. there are quite a few.

102
00:12:46.916 --> 00:12:49.666
But the news is not a crime show.

103
00:12:49.666 --> 00:12:54.041
The news said that a jewelry store
on Mannerheimintie was robbed.

104
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:57.624
Mannerheimintie is close by.
for your information.

105
00:12:57.624 --> 00:13:02.124
It's not the same street.
That Mannerheimintie is in Helsinki.

106
00:13:03.457 --> 00:13:06.415
And last week on the news...
-Henri Virtanen.

107
00:13:06.416 --> 00:13:10.916
And now it's time for a sermon.
Not the church kind. but... You know.

108
00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:16.791
Mom takes a deep breath and will
soon start barking like a machine gun.

109
00:13:17.124 --> 00:13:21.374
You mustn't watch those programs.
Those things are not for you.

110
00:13:21.374 --> 00:13:25.665
Ten-year-olds don't solve crimes
and watch news on television.

111
00:13:25.666 --> 00:13:29.541
Then why does the news come on
right after children's programs?

112
00:13:29.541 --> 00:13:34.041
Luckily you don't watch
children's programs anymore.

113
00:13:34.041 --> 00:13:38.541
When you have eaten. clear the table.
You know where everything goes.

114
00:13:38.707 --> 00:13:42.998
Sort the waste. Lid in the metal waste.
cup in the energy waste.

115
00:13:42.999 --> 00:13:47.499
I do like my mom. even if she is
no queen and talks crazy sometimes.

116
00:13:47.916 --> 00:13:51.499
What are you talking about?
-Nothing. Let's go.

117
00:14:03.999 --> 00:14:07.082
Hi.
-Well. shall we?

118
00:14:07.082 --> 00:14:10.207
Play.
-What?

119
00:14:10.207 --> 00:14:12.790
P-L-A-Y.

120
00:14:12.791 --> 00:14:17.291
Oh. Hilma! Don't do that!
Yeah. let's go. Just a sec.

121
00:14:19.082 --> 00:14:23.498
Don't go to the balcony.
Why is there such a mess again?

122
00:14:28.207 --> 00:14:32.665
Oh. it's Henkka.
Hi. I didn't notice you.

123
00:14:32.666 --> 00:14:37.166
I can close the door.
-Thank you. Aren't you a dear.

124
00:14:40.582 --> 00:14:43.623
Behave now!

125
00:14:49.457 --> 00:14:53.248
Could you close the door?

126
00:14:58.874 --> 00:15:03.374
We need fingerprints from the murder
weapon. -And all the other samples.

127
00:15:06.416 --> 00:15:10.916
Where is it?
-What?

128
00:15:11.332 --> 00:15:15.123
The axe?
-It's disappeared.

129
00:15:15.124 --> 00:15:17.832
Even the bloodstain has been wiped.

130
00:15:19.499 --> 00:15:23.957
Someone is clearly trying to
cover their tracks. -Samples.

131
00:15:52.124 --> 00:15:53.415
Hi.
-Hi.

132
00:17:20.249 --> 00:17:21.540
Samples.

133
00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:06.374
It's Kauko.

134
00:18:08.916 --> 00:18:10.749
Gosh darn it.

135
00:18:12.624 --> 00:18:14.915
<i>Kauko Mäyhkö. Eight years old.</i>

136
00:18:14.916 --> 00:18:19.416
<i>An okay-friend or part-time friend.
but sometimes a little exhausting.</i>

137
00:18:19.916 --> 00:18:24.416
<i>In birthday parties he takes a plate
full of cookies and covers them in spit.</i>

138
00:18:26.832 --> 00:18:29.582
<i>So he won't be left without any.</i>

139
00:18:31.916 --> 00:18:33.624
What are you doing?

140
00:18:33.624 --> 00:18:36.790
Found this on the street.
-It's not mine.

141
00:18:36.791 --> 00:18:40.332
It says "properti of Henkka" on it.

142
00:18:40.332 --> 00:18:41.748
Give it to me.

143
00:18:41.749 --> 00:18:46.249
Don't leave stuff
on the way of emergency vehicles.

144
00:18:47.332 --> 00:18:51.832
Even if your dad is a firefighter.
you are not. Was that all?

145
00:18:53.582 --> 00:18:56.040
I got a new thrasher. Wanna lose?

146
00:18:56.041 --> 00:19:00.041
We don't play with those.
Thrashers are for little kids.

147
00:19:00.041 --> 00:19:02.374
Go home. Your mom will give you a treat.

148
00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:06.874
You had thrashers last week.
-Yeah. but not anymore.

149
00:19:07.124 --> 00:19:10.874
What are you doing? -Nothing.
and we can't play with you now.

150
00:19:10.874 --> 00:19:14.249
If you can't play with me.
why can you play in the shed?

151
00:19:14.249 --> 00:19:17.540
Besides.
I have three lollipops in my pocket.

152
00:19:17.541 --> 00:19:19.082
Show me.

153
00:19:20.541 --> 00:19:22.999
I'll take the yellow one.
-Green one.

154
00:19:40.541 --> 00:19:44.957
So... What are you doing?
-Eating lollipops.

155
00:19:44.957 --> 00:19:47.290
Yeah. yeah. but what else?

156
00:19:47.291 --> 00:19:51.291
Nothing.
-Are you playing police again?

157
00:19:52.707 --> 00:19:55.415
Thanks for the lollipop. Bye.

158
00:19:55.416 --> 00:19:59.916
You mangy curs will suffer a stinging
defeat to the glorious thrasher.

159
00:20:01.874 --> 00:20:05.374
And besides. mom is not home.

160
00:20:10.499 --> 00:20:14.332
You need to be more careful.
What if he had come to the lab?

161
00:20:14.332 --> 00:20:16.248
Sorry.

162
00:20:16.249 --> 00:20:19.915
Whatever. I gotta go.

163
00:20:19.916 --> 00:20:22.874
Let's continue tomorrow.

164
00:20:28.999 --> 00:20:32.790
FEELINGS
JOY

165
00:20:34.124 --> 00:20:37.499
What feelings can you think of.
other than joy?

166
00:20:37.499 --> 00:20:39.915
What other feelings do people have?

167
00:20:40.999 --> 00:20:43.915
Sepi. be quiet and listen.

168
00:20:43.916 --> 00:20:48.416
Johannes! No. Put the crayons away.
this is not an art class.

169
00:20:51.207 --> 00:20:55.207
<i>As the school day goes on.
the more the teacher says</i>

170
00:20:55.207 --> 00:20:58.207
No! No. No!

171
00:20:58.207 --> 00:21:02.707
No. No. No!

172
00:21:03.082 --> 00:21:06.457
<i>To me. the teacher doesn't
ever have to say...</i> -No.

173
00:21:06.457 --> 00:21:10.957
<i>...because I focus. Or actually
I just look like it and stay quiet.</i>

174
00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:15.499
<i>Often I solve crimes in my head.
but my face looks like I'm focusing.</i>

175
00:21:16.457 --> 00:21:19.248
<i>There are crimes to be solved
even at school.</i>

176
00:21:20.082 --> 00:21:24.582
<i>For example. there is one men's shoe
in the janitor's closet by the gym.</i>

177
00:21:25.291 --> 00:21:27.749
<i>But only one. Why?</i>

178
00:21:27.749 --> 00:21:32.165
<i>The obvious answer is that the owner
of the shoe had been kidnapped.</i>

179
00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:36.666
<i>Otherwise he would have come
to get the missing shoe.</i>

180
00:21:37.874 --> 00:21:41.749
<i>Stage is closed.</i>
-Henkka?

181
00:21:43.124 --> 00:21:44.707
Henkka?

182
00:21:46.666 --> 00:21:50.082
What?
-Could you answer the question?

183
00:21:50.082 --> 00:21:53.957
Yeah. I mean...

184
00:21:59.041 --> 00:22:00.707
Schnauzer.

185
00:22:02.207 --> 00:22:06.707
What does a dog breed have
to do with emotions? -Schnauzer.

186
00:22:06.707 --> 00:22:08.540
Quiet. Sepi.

187
00:22:08.541 --> 00:22:13.041
Of course the dog can be cute.
and a person may become infatuated.

188
00:22:13.624 --> 00:22:17.832
He's infatuated with a schnauzer.

189
00:22:19.291 --> 00:22:22.791
Oh. Sepi-schnauzer.

190
00:22:24.374 --> 00:22:28.874
When a person is in a new situation.
and does not know how to behave -

191
00:22:28.874 --> 00:22:32.957
uncertainty can be expressed
for example by laughter.

192
00:22:32.957 --> 00:22:37.457
Laughter can be a defense.
some kind of protective shell.

193
00:22:37.541 --> 00:22:40.416
Uncertainty can come from fear.

194
00:22:40.416 --> 00:22:44.874
A new thing or a situation can be scary.

195
00:22:44.874 --> 00:22:48.665
And now onto homework.
-No!

196
00:22:48.666 --> 00:22:53.166
Over the course of the weekend
write a paper titled "What do I fear?"

197
00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:58.832
Due on Monday.
Have a spiffamous weekend.

198
00:22:58.832 --> 00:23:01.790
Spiffamous weekend.

199
00:23:27.541 --> 00:23:31.291
Sorry for the delay. I took a dump.
-Too much information.

200
00:23:43.416 --> 00:23:47.166
Jiikoo. Close your mouth.

201
00:23:47.166 --> 00:23:50.999
No way. dude's all schnauzer.

202
00:23:50.999 --> 00:23:54.832
What? -Dude is all schnauzer
for Sisko-Kaarina.

203
00:23:54.832 --> 00:23:57.248
Am not a schnauzer.

204
00:23:57.249 --> 00:23:59.374
Whatever. Scary it is in any case.

205
00:23:59.874 --> 00:24:01.457
As is that.

206
00:24:08.249 --> 00:24:11.582
What kind of snifflers have we here?

207
00:24:11.582 --> 00:24:14.123
Do you want a beating?

208
00:24:23.999 --> 00:24:28.499
Hands off my classmates.
-Look. more snifflers.

209
00:24:30.249 --> 00:24:33.832
Snifflers?
I bet you can't even start that clunker.

210
00:24:36.999 --> 00:24:38.582
We better leave now.

211
00:24:43.916 --> 00:24:47.749
Thanks. -No worries.
I just can't stand bullying.

212
00:24:47.749 --> 00:24:50.457
What did you do?
-Yanked out the spark plug wire.

213
00:24:50.624 --> 00:24:53.124
Let's go before he notices it.

214
00:24:56.666 --> 00:25:01.166
Sisko-Kaarina is kinda cool.
And knows a lot about engines.

215
00:25:01.207 --> 00:25:03.248
Yeah. she's ok.

216
00:25:03.249 --> 00:25:06.540
Competition. First one to see a Ferrari.

217
00:25:23.457 --> 00:25:27.207
Merc. Fiat.

218
00:25:29.791 --> 00:25:32.332
What are you gonna write that paper on?

219
00:25:32.332 --> 00:25:35.748
Kinda hard to write.
because I'm afraid of nothing.

220
00:25:35.749 --> 00:25:38.332
Nothing?
-Nothing.

221
00:25:38.332 --> 00:25:42.832
Is that a... No. Toyota.

222
00:25:44.082 --> 00:25:48.582
What are you doing there?
Come here. Or are you afraid of heights?

223
00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:50.791
Am not.

224
00:25:50.791 --> 00:25:54.291
Then why don't you come here?
- I don't feel like it.

225
00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:57.666
Dude's afraid of heights!

226
00:25:57.666 --> 00:26:02.166
Am not! I think dad is.
When we were in an amusement park -

227
00:26:04.124 --> 00:26:08.624
dad wanted to go on a scenic train.
but it turned out to be a roller coaster.

228
00:26:12.291 --> 00:26:15.582
So embarrassing. But I was totally cool.

229
00:26:16.249 --> 00:26:17.832
Ferrari!

230
00:26:20.249 --> 00:26:23.374
No. that's a Nissan.

231
00:26:23.374 --> 00:26:25.290
So it is.

232
00:26:30.957 --> 00:26:33.040
Let's call it a draw?
-Yeah.

233
00:26:33.791 --> 00:26:37.374
If the Ferraris had been on the move.
I would have won.

234
00:26:37.374 --> 00:26:39.707
Don't mistake bones for muscles.

235
00:26:39.707 --> 00:26:42.207
What does that even mean?
-Dunno.

236
00:26:43.207 --> 00:26:45.248
Who does the longest wheelie?

237
00:26:55.791 --> 00:26:58.541
Where have you been. mister?

238
00:26:58.541 --> 00:27:01.624
We were looking for
a Ferrari at the overpass.

239
00:27:01.624 --> 00:27:04.665
This long? Do you even hear
what you're saying?

240
00:27:04.666 --> 00:27:06.999
School ended ages ago.

241
00:27:06.999 --> 00:27:10.249
But we didn't see any!
And it was Jiikoo's idea.

242
00:27:10.249 --> 00:27:13.124
Why didn't you answer your phone?

243
00:27:13.124 --> 00:27:16.499
I guess it was in silent mode.

244
00:27:24.707 --> 00:27:27.540
What are these?
-Pantyhose.

245
00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:30.874
Whose?
-Mine.

246
00:27:35.624 --> 00:27:37.040
Your pantyhose?

247
00:27:37.041 --> 00:27:40.791
They are a piece of panty...
I mean. a piece of evidence.

248
00:27:40.791 --> 00:27:43.499
Where did you get these?
- I found them.

249
00:27:43.499 --> 00:27:45.207
Where?
-At Pumpputie.

250
00:27:45.207 --> 00:27:49.415
In Mrs. Luukka's hedge.
But they are not hers.

251
00:27:49.416 --> 00:27:52.499
Well... I guess not.

252
00:27:52.499 --> 00:27:56.749
You shouldn't have taken them.
They belong to someone.

253
00:27:56.749 --> 00:27:59.332
They belong to a murdered woman.

254
00:27:59.332 --> 00:28:02.332
The victim is a woman.
because men rarely wear pantyhose.

255
00:28:02.332 --> 00:28:06.123
She's small and lives close by.

256
00:28:06.124 --> 00:28:10.624
Henkka... Why on earth would
the owner of these have been murdered?

257
00:28:11.874 --> 00:28:16.374
How can you conclude that
from a pantyhose in a hedge?

258
00:28:16.374 --> 00:28:18.082
That is a tricky dilemma.

259
00:28:18.082 --> 00:28:22.582
Your reasoning can be rather complicated
and staggeringly confused.

260
00:28:24.082 --> 00:28:28.332
You need exercise. food and sleep -

261
00:28:28.332 --> 00:28:32.498
to keep your head
from going off in a tangent.

262
00:28:33.291 --> 00:28:36.749
Could I have those back?
-Henkka. come on.

263
00:28:36.749 --> 00:28:40.249
They are evidence.
-Nobody has been murdered.

264
00:28:40.249 --> 00:28:43.332
If not. why can't I get them back?

265
00:28:43.332 --> 00:28:47.790
If the owner has not been murdered.
she would like them back.

266
00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:51.457
You really get on my last nerve.

267
00:28:51.457 --> 00:28:54.498
Well. take them.

268
00:28:54.499 --> 00:28:58.749
Thanks. I will solve this stage.
-It's a case.

269
00:28:58.749 --> 00:29:03.249
And don't you have
a more important case?

270
00:29:03.499 --> 00:29:07.249
Homework.
-Yeah. yeah.

271
00:29:12.874 --> 00:29:17.374
<i>My homework was disturbed a bit by
mom and dad's fairly loud conversation.</i>

272
00:29:18.291 --> 00:29:22.791
Don't let him watch Sherlock Holmes!
-He just has a vivid imagination.

273
00:29:23.832 --> 00:29:26.498
<i>Mom calls them development discussions.</i>

274
00:29:26.916 --> 00:29:30.957
Development discussion in five minutes!

275
00:29:33.082 --> 00:29:36.498
<i>I don't get why
it's always in five minutes.</i>

276
00:29:36.499 --> 00:29:40.999
<i>Mom has some strange need to go exercise
and yell something strange before them.</i>

277
00:29:41.874 --> 00:29:45.290
Ok. time for a development discussion.

278
00:29:48.749 --> 00:29:51.082
WHAT DO I FEAR?

279
00:29:53.082 --> 00:29:57.332
<i>I decided to postpone homework
and focus on the important stuff.</i>

280
00:29:58.374 --> 00:30:02.040
<i>First I texted Jiikoo.</i>

281
00:30:02.041 --> 00:30:05.332
DETECTIVE AGENCY WORK TOMORROW

282
00:30:05.332 --> 00:30:07.498
<i>The reply was fairly fast.</i>

283
00:30:07.499 --> 00:30:08.915
PUT IT ON THE ALMANAC

284
00:30:08.916 --> 00:30:12.374
<i>Jiikoo does not have a calendar.
He uses an almanac.</i>

285
00:30:12.374 --> 00:30:14.665
<i>I don't know why.</i>

286
00:30:14.666 --> 00:30:18.957
<i>That is not important right now.
first things first.</i>

287
00:30:18.957 --> 00:30:21.623
<i>I have to prioritize.</i>

288
00:30:23.332 --> 00:30:26.457
<i>There are 36 houses on Pumpputie.</i>

289
00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:30.373
<i>Our house is number 18.
Number 5 is opposite it.</i>

290
00:30:30.374 --> 00:30:34.874
<i>I don't know who lives there.
It doesn't matter. and neither do these.</i>

291
00:30:35.041 --> 00:30:39.541
<i>Mid-sized women with missing pantyhose
do not live in those.</i>

292
00:30:40.291 --> 00:30:42.707
<i>Thus the noose begins to tighten.</i>

293
00:30:42.707 --> 00:30:47.207
<i>The murderer does not live with us.
that is a fact. certain information.</i>

294
00:30:52.832 --> 00:30:54.415
It's ready.

295
00:30:55.457 --> 00:30:57.832
MAILBOX THIEVES STRUCK AGAIN

296
00:31:09.957 --> 00:31:12.332
Good morning.
-Good morning.

297
00:31:15.791 --> 00:31:18.832
Are you in a hurry?
-No. Hmow sho?

298
00:31:18.832 --> 00:31:21.582
Mjust a thought.

299
00:31:21.582 --> 00:31:26.040
Dom't thalk with food im your mouth.
-What?

300
00:31:26.041 --> 00:31:30.541
Henkka. dom't thalk with food im
your mouth. -You're thalkimg yourshelf.

301
00:31:30.957 --> 00:31:35.415
Henkka thalks with food im his mouth!
-Sho does shomeone else.

302
00:31:35.416 --> 00:31:39.124
Doesh not.
-Shtop...

303
00:31:39.124 --> 00:31:40.707
Stop fooling around.

304
00:31:43.082 --> 00:31:45.998
Henkka. get the door.

305
00:31:54.874 --> 00:31:58.415
I assume you have identity
you can prove to yourself?

306
00:31:58.416 --> 00:32:02.207
It's upstairs. I have to go
to the toilet and get dressed.

307
00:32:02.207 --> 00:32:05.290
Don't take comic books.
or it'll take too long.

308
00:32:08.832 --> 00:32:13.332
Hi there. Let me see that fancy
police card of yours again.

309
00:32:19.041 --> 00:32:23.541
Simply incredible. Wonderful. J.K.
Take good care of that.

310
00:32:24.582 --> 00:32:27.498
Come and see Jorma-Kalevi's fancy card.

311
00:32:27.499 --> 00:32:30.665
I've seen that... Hi. It looks grand.

312
00:32:30.666 --> 00:32:34.999
Aren't you going to offer something
to drink? -Oh. want some coffee?

313
00:32:34.999 --> 00:32:39.499
Little boys... I mean police men don't
drink coffee. I'll bring you some juice.

314
00:32:56.832 --> 00:32:59.290
How is it?

315
00:33:21.707 --> 00:33:24.540
Yeah...

316
00:33:24.541 --> 00:33:29.041
Do the police men have
a Black Maria waiting outside?

317
00:33:30.457 --> 00:33:32.415
Who's Maria?

318
00:33:33.124 --> 00:33:35.457
It's just the two of us playing.

319
00:33:35.457 --> 00:33:36.415
Black Maria.

320
00:33:41.166 --> 00:33:44.166
You sometimes say the weirdest things.

321
00:33:44.707 --> 00:33:48.665
Where are you boys going?
-To play hide and seek.

322
00:33:48.666 --> 00:33:50.707
That's nice.

323
00:33:55.291 --> 00:33:58.916
That's nice and brisk.

324
00:34:08.874 --> 00:34:13.374
Pumpputie. The houses crossed over
have been excluded.

325
00:34:13.707 --> 00:34:18.207
Why is there a cross over your house?
-There are no murderers at our house.

326
00:34:19.041 --> 00:34:21.416
Why has Luukka's house been marked?

327
00:34:21.416 --> 00:34:24.832
The crime scene
is right next to Luukka's house.

328
00:34:24.832 --> 00:34:27.790
I saw someone digging in Luukka's yard.

329
00:34:30.041 --> 00:34:33.541
Maybe they were burying a corpse?
-That's right.

330
00:34:34.541 --> 00:34:38.874
But the pantyhose do not
belong to Luukka. -How do you know?

331
00:34:42.457 --> 00:34:43.832
Look.

332
00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:49.332
Focus.

333
00:35:05.832 --> 00:35:09.707
<i>They just won't fit!</i>

334
00:35:14.457 --> 00:35:18.540
They just won't fit!
Believe me!

335
00:35:48.624 --> 00:35:50.915
Take it to the separator.

336
00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:11.998
Let's start there.
-Take the map with you.

337
00:36:19.582 --> 00:36:21.165
Take the shovel.

338
00:36:39.791 --> 00:36:43.832
This is our chance.
Careful now. Let's investigate the yard.

339
00:36:50.374 --> 00:36:51.957
Look.

340
00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:36.916
What is that?
-A drone. Every kid has those nowadays.

341
00:37:38.457 --> 00:37:40.248
Pretty cool.

342
00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:45.166
I'll put an end to your mischief.

343
00:37:45.749 --> 00:37:46.707
Hide!

344
00:37:48.874 --> 00:37:51.124
Box thieves!

345
00:38:16.499 --> 00:38:20.999
That was a close call. The drone
revealed us. Who's steering it?

346
00:38:24.249 --> 00:38:27.874
I don't see anyone.
Did you find anything?

347
00:38:27.874 --> 00:38:32.165
This carrot. -Maybe the body
is not in the vegetable patch.

348
00:38:46.291 --> 00:38:50.791
We have to find a small-to-mid-sized
person. who owns the pantyhose.

349
00:38:50.916 --> 00:38:55.416
When we find the victim...
-We will also find the murderer.

350
00:38:55.624 --> 00:38:59.457
Some day you will be
the Sherlock Holmes of southern Lahti.

351
00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:24.291
To the fire! -Go home.
Your mom will give you a treat.

352
00:39:24.332 --> 00:39:27.207
We can't play with you.
-Where are you going?

353
00:39:27.207 --> 00:39:30.207
To the library.
-It's not open on Saturdays.

354
00:39:30.207 --> 00:39:34.707
We're going to the library
to play softball with the big boys.

355
00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:39.874
Then why don't you have bats or gloves?

356
00:39:39.874 --> 00:39:42.374
The big boys will bring them.

357
00:39:42.374 --> 00:39:45.999
Don't try to play detective.
It's childish.

358
00:39:45.999 --> 00:39:48.082
You're not going to play.

359
00:39:48.082 --> 00:39:50.707
Go home.
Your mom will give you a treat.

360
00:39:50.707 --> 00:39:52.498
Bye. we're going now.

361
00:40:00.916 --> 00:40:04.041
Is he following us?
-Looks like it.

362
00:40:07.874 --> 00:40:09.832
The big boys are coming soon!

363
00:40:19.249 --> 00:40:20.832
Oh no!

364
00:40:50.666 --> 00:40:51.999
Henkka!

365
00:41:10.707 --> 00:41:13.790
What's the holdup? Come on!
-No.

366
00:41:13.791 --> 00:41:15.999
Hurry up. they're soon here.

367
00:41:16.749 --> 00:41:19.582
I can't climb.
-What do you mean?

368
00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:24.582
I don't dare.

369
00:41:24.582 --> 00:41:26.457
Then hide. and fast!

370
00:41:34.874 --> 00:41:38.540
Where did the snifflers go?
-Better come out.

371
00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:41.916
Yeah. we won't do anything.

372
00:41:57.957 --> 00:42:02.457
It's idiotic to pick on minors.
-Don't change the subject.

373
00:42:03.541 --> 00:42:06.874
You're afraid of heights.
-Am not.

374
00:42:06.874 --> 00:42:08.415
"I don't dare."

375
00:42:08.416 --> 00:42:12.916
You're afraid of the moped boys.
-Am not.

376
00:42:17.957 --> 00:42:20.207
I just don't want them bullying.

377
00:42:20.207 --> 00:42:22.998
No! Don't!
-Kauko!

378
00:42:23.832 --> 00:42:27.498
Give it to me!
-Why don't you take it?

379
00:42:27.499 --> 00:42:29.499
Give it to me!

380
00:42:29.499 --> 00:42:31.999
We have to act fast. Plan.

381
00:42:33.374 --> 00:42:35.165
Don't!
-Take it!

382
00:42:35.166 --> 00:42:38.166
I'll tell mom!

383
00:42:42.541 --> 00:42:47.041
Stop that right now.
or I will release my schnauzer!

384
00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:49.291
His name is Killer.

385
00:42:49.291 --> 00:42:53.624
Yeah. his name... is Killer.

386
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:57.582
POLICE!
STOP!!

387
00:43:00.916 --> 00:43:02.499
Cops. let's move!

388
00:43:14.541 --> 00:43:16.707
Don't release the dog!

389
00:43:16.707 --> 00:43:19.915
There is no dog here.
-Is that Henkka?

390
00:43:21.749 --> 00:43:23.540
Yeah. and me.

391
00:43:28.874 --> 00:43:30.582
Are you ok?
-Yeah.

392
00:43:30.582 --> 00:43:34.582
Go home carefully now.
-Yeah... Thanks. guys.

393
00:43:34.582 --> 00:43:38.415
No prob. See ya. Kauko.
-Yeah. Bye.

394
00:44:29.207 --> 00:44:32.748
Howdy.
-Howdy.

395
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:07.457
Who will ask?
-You go. you're the boss.

396
00:45:07.457 --> 00:45:10.332
Okay. Roger.
-Roger.

397
00:45:12.957 --> 00:45:15.540
<i>I was feverishly pondering
the meaning of FBI.</i>

398
00:45:15.541 --> 00:45:19.582
<i>pantyhose.
the small-to-mid-sized murder victim -</i>

399
00:45:19.582 --> 00:45:21.540
<i>and the crucial opening line.</i>

400
00:45:33.874 --> 00:45:36.665
Good day. How are you?

401
00:45:38.332 --> 00:45:41.498
I wanted to ask if you have a sister.

402
00:45:41.499 --> 00:45:43.249
Well ask then.

403
00:45:43.249 --> 00:45:45.957
Do you have a sister?
-Yes.

404
00:45:45.957 --> 00:45:48.540
<i>Okay. here we are.</i>

405
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:52.957
<i>Southern Lahti FBI regional office
is on the right track.</i>

406
00:45:55.166 --> 00:45:59.666
Could I meet your sister?
-Which one?

407
00:46:00.041 --> 00:46:02.499
The small-to-mid-sized one.

408
00:46:02.499 --> 00:46:06.999
Is either of your sisters taller
than me. but shorter than you?

409
00:46:07.082 --> 00:46:08.915
Both.

410
00:46:08.916 --> 00:46:12.291
Is either of your sisters
15 centimeters taller than me.

411
00:46:12.291 --> 00:46:15.207
but 20 centimeters shorter than you?

412
00:46:15.207 --> 00:46:16.790
Both.

413
00:46:16.791 --> 00:46:20.374
Are your sisters home?
-Yeah. So?

414
00:46:20.374 --> 00:46:22.832
<i>If they are missing pantyhose.</i>

415
00:46:22.832 --> 00:46:26.998
<i>the murder case is solved
and in the books.</i>

416
00:46:26.999 --> 00:46:28.832
Could we meet them?

417
00:46:30.416 --> 00:46:33.999
Who is "we"?
-Me and my...

418
00:46:33.999 --> 00:46:36.332
And your imaginary friend?

419
00:46:36.332 --> 00:46:40.832
I would like to ask if they are
missing something important.

420
00:46:41.582 --> 00:46:44.165
Like what?
-Pantyhose.

421
00:46:45.707 --> 00:46:47.165
What?

422
00:46:48.374 --> 00:46:52.040
I guess I was mistaken. Sorry. Bye.

423
00:46:55.791 --> 00:46:57.541
Hands up!

424
00:47:01.457 --> 00:47:03.790
What are you doing?

425
00:47:03.791 --> 00:47:06.041
I was just about to arrest them.

426
00:47:07.832 --> 00:47:11.290
They are innocent.
and this is humiliating.

427
00:47:11.291 --> 00:47:13.207
Let's move on.

428
00:47:33.749 --> 00:47:38.249
Yeah. milk doesn't suit Hermanni at all.

429
00:47:40.166 --> 00:47:44.666
It makes his stomach upset. He can only
use lactose-free cream in his coffee.

430
00:47:46.832 --> 00:47:51.332
It tastes horrible.
-Yes. But the stomach is what it is.

431
00:47:52.457 --> 00:47:56.957
I have also had erysipelas for a while.

432
00:47:56.957 --> 00:48:00.832
I can only eat gluten-free cookies.

433
00:48:00.832 --> 00:48:03.998
I haven't found the good ones
anywhere recently.

434
00:48:03.999 --> 00:48:07.499
Doubt I will with these eyes...

435
00:48:08.499 --> 00:48:12.207
Take the glasses.

436
00:48:12.207 --> 00:48:16.665
Where are those? I can't find
anything anymore with these eyes.

437
00:48:16.666 --> 00:48:21.166
Those were expensive reading glasses.
-I meant the juice glasses.

438
00:48:26.082 --> 00:48:28.748
Yeah. juice glasses.

439
00:48:28.749 --> 00:48:33.249
Our guests are getting thirsty
while that Hermanni just goes on and on.

440
00:49:17.541 --> 00:49:18.916
There you are.

441
00:49:20.124 --> 00:49:22.165
Thank you.

442
00:49:22.166 --> 00:49:24.749
So it is.

443
00:49:24.749 --> 00:49:28.457
So it is. Indeed.

444
00:49:28.457 --> 00:49:31.665
That Hermanni just goes on and on.

445
00:49:31.666 --> 00:49:35.999
Usually he reads
the newspaper all quiet -

446
00:49:35.999 --> 00:49:40.499
but now we haven't gotten the newspaper.
because our mailbox has been stolen.

447
00:49:44.124 --> 00:49:45.707
So it is.

448
00:49:49.666 --> 00:49:51.541
What brought you boys...

449
00:49:51.541 --> 00:49:55.832
Hermanni.
Stop jabbering. we have visitors.

450
00:49:58.499 --> 00:50:02.999
What I was about to ask is.
what brought you boys here?

451
00:50:05.124 --> 00:50:09.624
We are... looking for a friend.

452
00:50:10.041 --> 00:50:13.207
Small-to-mid-sized one.

453
00:50:13.207 --> 00:50:16.707
Yeah. We are really lonely boys.

454
00:50:18.416 --> 00:50:22.916
Well that's a shame.
-A shame indeed.

455
00:50:24.416 --> 00:50:28.916
But at least you have each other.

456
00:50:29.249 --> 00:50:31.665
Yes. that is nice. but

457
00:50:31.666 --> 00:50:35.207
we would like to play
hockey without skates with two goals.

458
00:50:35.207 --> 00:50:37.873
We would need more players for that.

459
00:50:37.874 --> 00:50:42.374
I played in Kiekkoreipas
when I was younger.

460
00:50:45.791 --> 00:50:50.249
I could...
-Stop jabbering. we have visitors.

461
00:50:51.416 --> 00:50:55.749
You have to continue further.

462
00:50:55.749 --> 00:50:59.374
There are boys of your age
on this street.

463
00:50:59.374 --> 00:51:02.790
What was the name of that Virtanen-boy?

464
00:51:02.791 --> 00:51:04.291
Heimo.
-No.

465
00:51:04.291 --> 00:51:06.541
Hemmo.
-No.

466
00:51:07.707 --> 00:51:10.915
Hermanni.
-That is you.

467
00:51:15.791 --> 00:51:18.666
Hemppa.

468
00:51:18.666 --> 00:51:21.999
Hemppa.

469
00:51:21.999 --> 00:51:26.457
Now I got it. It was Hemppa.

470
00:51:26.457 --> 00:51:29.498
Hemppa it was. Yes.

471
00:51:36.041 --> 00:51:39.791
How's the juice?

472
00:51:46.457 --> 00:51:48.957
Thank you. It was good.

473
00:51:48.957 --> 00:51:51.623
Thank you.
We'll go and ask Hemppa to play.

474
00:51:51.624 --> 00:51:56.124
Are you leaving already?
We have so few visitors.

475
00:51:56.832 --> 00:52:01.332
I could have made lunch too.
-No thank you. Bye.

476
00:52:11.541 --> 00:52:15.707
I could take a couple of sausages.
-Stop jabbering.

477
00:52:15.707 --> 00:52:19.373
Or even one.

478
00:52:22.332 --> 00:52:26.832
Look. Hemppa. Granny was telling
the truth. The mailbox has been stolen.

479
00:52:27.166 --> 00:52:30.457
First of all. don't call me Hemppa.

480
00:52:30.457 --> 00:52:34.957
And secondly. why would the granny
have lied about the stolen mailbox?

481
00:52:37.582 --> 00:52:38.832
Look.

482
00:52:41.166 --> 00:52:44.416
There is a mailbox missing here too.
-And there.

483
00:52:45.332 --> 00:52:49.623
This means more work
for the Detective Agency.

484
00:52:49.624 --> 00:52:53.749
How do we solve everything before
dinnertime? -We have to prioritize.

485
00:52:53.749 --> 00:52:56.415
What's that?
-Put first things first.

486
00:52:56.416 --> 00:53:00.624
Privysize all you want. as long as
I'm at the dinner table by five.

487
00:53:00.624 --> 00:53:04.582
We are solving a murder.
and you're just thinking about food.

488
00:53:06.541 --> 00:53:09.249
That again!
I'm gonna throw a rock at it.

489
00:53:09.249 --> 00:53:12.290
Don't bother.
I wonder who is steering it?

490
00:53:12.291 --> 00:53:15.874
Don't care.
It revealed us to Mrs. Luukka.

491
00:53:15.874 --> 00:53:19.582
Or maybe it was trying to help us.

492
00:53:19.582 --> 00:53:22.748
Maybe it was trying to warn us
about Mrs. Luukka.

493
00:53:25.166 --> 00:53:27.499
Don't be afraid.

494
00:53:32.416 --> 00:53:36.291
Wow! This thing is amazing!

495
00:53:39.541 --> 00:53:42.457
Ouch!
-Darn it.

496
00:53:42.457 --> 00:53:45.957
You threw it straight to my nutters.

497
00:53:45.957 --> 00:53:48.415
No... Darn it.

498
00:53:49.332 --> 00:53:53.832
I was trying...
-Don't. This will pass soon.

499
00:53:58.666 --> 00:54:03.166
Okay...
Which house will we privysize next?

500
00:54:52.457 --> 00:54:55.415
One meat mug please.

501
00:54:55.416 --> 00:54:58.499
With all the condiments?
-Go ahead.

502
00:54:59.707 --> 00:55:01.290
Okay.

503
00:55:07.207 --> 00:55:11.165
<i>Our investigations took us
to house number 11 next.</i>

504
00:55:12.249 --> 00:55:16.749
Hi. Wonderful. that you could come.

505
00:55:17.291 --> 00:55:19.916
I thought you would be a bit older.

506
00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:22.916
but it's great to have
younger folks too.

507
00:55:22.916 --> 00:55:26.832
Come in fast. we're about to start.

508
00:55:34.166 --> 00:55:38.082
Ok. nice to have new faces.
Come in. come in.

509
00:55:41.624 --> 00:55:45.082
Ok. wonderful to have you here.

510
00:55:45.082 --> 00:55:47.873
Spread out.

511
00:55:49.499 --> 00:55:53.540
Now we are going to get exotic.

512
00:55:53.541 --> 00:55:57.582
The topic of this lesson is...

513
00:55:57.582 --> 00:56:02.082
Latin dances!
-Lambadaa. zumbadaa! Baila. baila!

514
00:56:06.582 --> 00:56:10.540
Raimo already showed some of the moves
we are going to learn today.

515
00:56:10.541 --> 00:56:15.041
Now relax your hips
and get your party vibes going!

516
00:56:16.832 --> 00:56:20.623
Fajitas!

517
00:56:23.957 --> 00:56:26.123
Sinikka. the player.

518
00:56:29.416 --> 00:56:30.707
Yeah!

519
00:56:43.541 --> 00:56:45.124
Remember the eyes.

520
00:56:59.791 --> 00:57:02.416
Do you recognize these? Do you?

521
00:57:06.916 --> 00:57:11.416
Looks like we have found dancing pants
without their owner on the floor.

522
00:57:15.749 --> 00:57:19.165
They look fairly small.

523
00:57:19.166 --> 00:57:23.666
Check. if you have your pants on.
-I have.

524
00:57:25.207 --> 00:57:28.832
Does anyone recognize these?

525
00:57:30.416 --> 00:57:33.541
The person inside of these
has been murdered.

526
00:57:33.541 --> 00:57:35.666
Who will confess?

527
00:57:35.666 --> 00:57:38.457
Have you found pantyhose somewhere?

528
00:57:40.582 --> 00:57:44.582
We won't tell. We suspect.

529
00:57:44.582 --> 00:57:47.832
What do you suspect?
-We won't tell.

530
00:57:48.874 --> 00:57:52.332
Well. I'm not missing pantyhose.

531
00:57:53.166 --> 00:57:54.457
Sinikka?

532
00:58:02.166 --> 00:58:05.916
I'm not either.
And apparently neither is anyone else.

533
00:58:07.457 --> 00:58:11.957
Do you know anyone. who would know
if the owner has been murdered.

534
00:58:13.374 --> 00:58:17.207
Unfortunately
we can't help you with this.

535
00:58:17.207 --> 00:58:19.582
Well ok. see you.

536
00:58:21.624 --> 00:58:23.915
Who are you boys. anyway?

537
00:58:27.874 --> 00:58:31.040
We're just Ef-pee-i-men.

538
00:58:37.666 --> 00:58:41.707
Mambaaa!

539
00:58:46.249 --> 00:58:47.832
Weird people.

540
00:58:50.666 --> 00:58:53.332
It's getting close to dinner time.

541
00:59:03.124 --> 00:59:05.499
Let's spread out so we make it in time.

542
00:59:28.457 --> 00:59:31.373
Well?
-Nothing.

543
00:59:36.582 --> 00:59:39.123
Pumpputie 44 left.

544
00:59:39.124 --> 00:59:43.249
The one where that convicted
criminal lives? That... That...

545
00:59:46.124 --> 00:59:49.374
Pet killer.

546
00:59:53.582 --> 00:59:56.373
It's probably just a legend.
or a rumor.

547
00:59:56.374 --> 00:59:59.124
We only believe in facts.
or certain things.

548
00:59:59.124 --> 01:00:00.790
He might be really nice.

549
01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:21.416
Don't go there.

550
01:00:25.499 --> 01:00:27.124
It's open.

551
01:00:28.457 --> 01:00:32.957
Henkka. Oh crud.

552
01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:13.166
Okay. Fluffy.
We are almost ready for the party.

553
01:02:15.666 --> 01:02:18.082
We get to eat.

554
01:02:41.332 --> 01:02:43.915
Okay. time to eat.

555
01:02:50.874 --> 01:02:54.290
Call the police.
-What?

556
01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:58.999
He was the murderer.
-How so? We didn't see anything.

557
01:02:58.999 --> 01:03:01.957
We need evidence.
We need to go there again.

558
01:03:01.957 --> 01:03:03.873
I won't go there again.

559
01:03:09.291 --> 01:03:12.374
What are you doing?
-Calling a colleague.

560
01:03:12.374 --> 01:03:16.290
Don't call anywhere.
We can't prove anything.

561
01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:21.041
Give me that.
-We can't jump to conclusions.

562
01:03:27.291 --> 01:03:31.166
First you throw a rock at me. and now
you broke the screen of my phone!

563
01:03:31.166 --> 01:03:32.832
What are you doing?

564
01:03:32.832 --> 01:03:36.582
I was trying to hit that buzzer.
And I apologized.

565
01:03:36.582 --> 01:03:41.082
No you didn't. I'm going now.
It's already past my dinnertime.

566
01:03:41.249 --> 01:03:45.749
Go then. Have a cold meal.
-We have a microwave.

567
01:03:45.874 --> 01:03:49.624
I'll solve this without you!
-Yeah right!

568
01:04:06.416 --> 01:04:10.291
Yes. Yes. I'm sorry you were offended

569
01:04:10.291 --> 01:04:13.624
but nothing really bad happened.

570
01:04:13.624 --> 01:04:18.124
Boys want adventures. This only shows
they have initiative and courage.

571
01:04:21.332 --> 01:04:23.873
Yes. Yes.

572
01:04:23.874 --> 01:04:26.707
You should understand

573
01:04:26.707 --> 01:04:30.248
that fantasy and reality
can get mixed up in a child's head.

574
01:04:30.249 --> 01:04:33.749
Yes. I'm sorry.

575
01:04:33.749 --> 01:04:37.040
So that I won't say anything
I will regret.

576
01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:41.041
I will just wish you
have a lovely evening. Goodbye.

577
01:04:41.041 --> 01:04:45.541
Henri Virtanen! What... Why...

578
01:04:46.874 --> 01:04:51.374
And look how late it is.

579
01:04:51.374 --> 01:04:55.874
Henkka. You know mom loves you.

580
01:04:56.291 --> 01:04:57.957
And dad.

581
01:04:59.832 --> 01:05:03.165
This simply cannot go on.
Neighbors are calling.

582
01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:07.499
Why on earth have you vandalized
Mrs. Luukka's vegetable patch?

583
01:05:07.499 --> 01:05:11.040
Mrs. Luukka is very angry.
-And dad.

584
01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:13.957
You will go and apologize.
And get our shovel.

585
01:05:13.957 --> 01:05:16.748
We were investigating...
-Stop it already!

586
01:05:16.749 --> 01:05:21.249
I will not accept this. Go to you room
to investigate what you have done.

587
01:05:21.624 --> 01:05:24.332
To your room! Right now!

588
01:06:00.499 --> 01:06:04.124
<i>I don't need anyone</i>

589
01:06:04.124 --> 01:06:08.457
<i>I don't need someone</i>

590
01:06:08.457 --> 01:06:12.165
<i>Who will always doubt</i>

591
01:06:12.166 --> 01:06:16.166
<i>I will be okay</i>

592
01:06:16.166 --> 01:06:20.541
<i>I will find my way</i>

593
01:06:20.541 --> 01:06:24.541
<i>A murder has happened</i>

594
01:06:24.541 --> 01:06:28.416
<i>It can be evidenced
So it can't be questioned</i>

595
01:06:28.416 --> 01:06:31.082
<i>It is no illusion</i>

596
01:06:32.082 --> 01:06:35.957
<i>I will be okay</i>

597
01:06:35.957 --> 01:06:40.457
<i>Though the case is in disarray</i>

598
01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:47.041
<i>Alone I will investigate
Alone I will solve</i>

599
01:06:47.041 --> 01:06:50.041
<i>I don't need anyone</i>

600
01:06:50.041 --> 01:06:53.999
<i>I will search through life</i>

601
01:06:55.457 --> 01:06:57.748
<i>I don't need anyone</i>

602
01:06:57.749 --> 01:07:01.832
<i>Mom forbids. Jiikoo gives up</i>

603
01:07:03.374 --> 01:07:06.040
<i>I don't need them</i>

604
01:07:06.041 --> 01:07:10.541
<i>I will comb the countryside</i>

605
01:07:11.416 --> 01:07:15.916
<i>I won't accept less
I will solve this mess</i>

606
01:07:16.291 --> 01:07:18.957
<i>It shouldn't be said</i>

607
01:07:20.457 --> 01:07:24.582
<i>But I'm becoming so irritated</i>

608
01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:26.623
<i>That I will say it</i>

609
01:07:26.624 --> 01:07:29.957
Look at that!
<i>-Gosh darn it!</i>

610
01:07:36.416 --> 01:07:40.416
<i>I will be okay</i>

611
01:07:40.416 --> 01:07:44.916
<i>I will find my way</i>

612
01:08:21.041 --> 01:08:25.082
FOREST
NOW!!

613
01:08:41.957 --> 01:08:44.498
Hi. Jiikoo. Don't hang up.

614
01:08:44.499 --> 01:08:47.790
I think you were right about the drone.

615
01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.207
It gave me a tip.

616
01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:32.249
So?

617
01:09:32.249 --> 01:09:35.832
I'm sorry I threw a rock at you
and was a bit of an a-hole.

618
01:09:35.832 --> 01:09:38.332
You are my best friend. Sorry.

619
01:09:45.207 --> 01:09:48.082
Kivimutka reporting for duty.

620
01:09:48.082 --> 01:09:50.457
Good. Let's approach carefully.

621
01:09:55.207 --> 01:09:58.165
Well? Aren't you coming?

622
01:10:05.457 --> 01:10:07.665
Jiikoo. are you afraid?

623
01:10:09.166 --> 01:10:11.666
Well... Yes.

624
01:10:12.957 --> 01:10:14.790
Of the dark?

625
01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:20.207
Yeah. -Well. now we know
what to write our papers on.

626
01:10:28.874 --> 01:10:31.290
I got this.

627
01:10:39.207 --> 01:10:41.373
Are you ok?

628
01:10:41.374 --> 01:10:42.957
Yeah.

629
01:11:29.749 --> 01:11:31.332
The light.

630
01:11:53.374 --> 01:11:56.999
The missing mailboxes.
-Let's retreat.

631
01:12:04.291 --> 01:12:06.832
What was that?

632
01:12:06.832 --> 01:12:09.040
Search the area!

633
01:12:12.207 --> 01:12:13.832
Turn it off!

634
01:12:16.124 --> 01:12:17.707
Over there!

635
01:12:20.249 --> 01:12:21.957
Run away!

636
01:13:33.457 --> 01:13:35.040
Jiikoo?

637
01:13:38.499 --> 01:13:41.207
Jiikoo. where are you?

638
01:13:58.957 --> 01:14:00.540
Jiikoo?

639
01:14:33.749 --> 01:14:36.874
Phew. There you are.

640
01:14:36.874 --> 01:14:39.665
We found the stolen mailboxes.

641
01:14:39.666 --> 01:14:41.624
Jiikoo. are you ok?

642
01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:58.041
The snifflers.

643
01:15:02.666 --> 01:15:04.666
Hey! Don't!

644
01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:06.374
Pick him up.

645
01:15:09.041 --> 01:15:12.374
What did you see?
-What does he have in his pocket?

646
01:15:14.874 --> 01:15:17.290
Lousy phone. Old model.

647
01:15:17.291 --> 01:15:18.999
Gimme that.

648
01:15:18.999 --> 01:15:21.249
Any money?

649
01:15:21.249 --> 01:15:23.415
No. but what are these?

650
01:15:25.624 --> 01:15:29.249
Did you come to the woods
to smell some underwear?

651
01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:35.124
I asked what are you doing here?

652
01:15:35.124 --> 01:15:36.915
Leave Henkka alone!

653
01:15:37.874 --> 01:15:39.874
Get off me. bloody brat!

654
01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:48.415
Now you're really going to get it!

655
01:15:54.166 --> 01:15:56.457
What's going on here?

656
01:15:56.457 --> 01:15:59.790
Just playing around with our mates.

657
01:15:59.791 --> 01:16:02.082
They are not our mates.

658
01:16:02.082 --> 01:16:04.998
They took Henkka's phone.

659
01:16:04.999 --> 01:16:08.915
So you're picking on
someone smaller than you.

660
01:16:08.916 --> 01:16:10.999
Give the phone back. Right now.

661
01:16:12.624 --> 01:16:16.749
Or else?
-Or Fluffy gets mad.

662
01:16:23.041 --> 01:16:27.541
Did you hear that? Fluffy said...

663
01:16:37.874 --> 01:16:40.665
Maniac!
-Total nutcase!

664
01:16:58.457 --> 01:17:01.873
Are you ok?
-Yeah.

665
01:17:03.666 --> 01:17:08.041
You're the boys who stopped by
to scream at my yard.

666
01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:13.457
Yeah. Sorry.

667
01:17:13.791 --> 01:17:17.041
It's ok. You should have come in.

668
01:17:17.041 --> 01:17:21.249
I had just baked.
It's Fluffy's birthday today.

669
01:17:21.249 --> 01:17:24.165
We were investigating a crime
and got scared.

670
01:17:24.166 --> 01:17:27.041
You don't need to be afraid of Fluffy.

671
01:17:33.374 --> 01:17:37.040
Oh. apologies. I'm Teuvo.

672
01:17:37.041 --> 01:17:41.457
Henkka. He's Jiikoo.
-Hi.

673
01:17:41.457 --> 01:17:45.957
Investigating a crime. you said?
Hopefully nothing bad has happened?

674
01:17:48.791 --> 01:17:52.291
The owner of these pantyhose
has been murdered.

675
01:17:52.291 --> 01:17:56.791
No. that can't be. Wait a minute.

676
01:18:01.082 --> 01:18:02.915
I was walking Fluffy.

677
01:18:02.916 --> 01:18:05.957
and someone was moving in
stuff to the house next door.

678
01:18:05.957 --> 01:18:09.498
I think these pantyhose
were hanging from the car.

679
01:18:12.832 --> 01:18:15.748
I think these might have
dropped from the car.

680
01:18:17.999 --> 01:18:22.499
House next door? Pumpputie 427
-Yes.

681
01:18:23.666 --> 01:18:28.166
We didn't go to that house. because
we thought no one was living there.

682
01:18:28.832 --> 01:18:33.207
Thank you for your statement.
witness Teuvo. -You're welcome.

683
01:18:33.207 --> 01:18:37.540
By the way. we solved one crime.
-The missing mailboxes!

684
01:18:37.541 --> 01:18:41.207
Bye. Teuvo. And Fluffy.
-Bye-bye.

685
01:18:43.582 --> 01:18:46.748
Let's go find some truffles.

686
01:18:52.541 --> 01:18:54.499
Let's save the mailboxes.

687
01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:06.999
Oh no.

688
01:19:08.041 --> 01:19:12.166
We have to call grown ups!
-Emergency number!

689
01:19:16.999 --> 01:19:18.957
<i>Emergency response centre.</i>

690
01:19:35.832 --> 01:19:37.373
<i>Hello?</i>

691
01:20:08.291 --> 01:20:10.916
Don't play with fire. kids.

692
01:20:22.082 --> 01:20:26.582
You have exhibited extraordinary
resourcefulness and courage.

693
01:20:30.041 --> 01:20:33.541
Therefore we present you
with these medals.

694
01:20:46.916 --> 01:20:51.416
Thank you. It is clear. that we worked
to find the missing mailboxes.

695
01:20:52.749 --> 01:20:55.874
But this says. it is for courage.

696
01:20:55.874 --> 01:20:59.624
This does not belong to me.
but the true hero.

697
01:20:59.624 --> 01:21:03.290
who put out the wildfire.
Kauko Mäyhkö!

698
01:21:35.291 --> 01:21:39.791
<i>The work of a detective is usually not
so glorious. but rather a tedious chore.</i>

699
01:21:40.624 --> 01:21:43.999
<i>Collecting evidence and so on.</i>

700
01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:48.499
<i>But now we're feeling kind of heroic.</i>

701
01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:58.041
<i>The biggest reward for me and Kivimutka
are the satisfied customers.</i>

702
01:21:58.457 --> 01:22:00.957
<i>And chocolate of course.</i>

703
01:22:05.124 --> 01:22:07.832
<i>We got a couple of bars
from that couple.</i>

704
01:22:10.041 --> 01:22:12.999
<i>Mrs. Luukka gave us a big slab
of chocolate and our shovel.</i>

705
01:22:12.999 --> 01:22:15.082
<i>which we shared.</i>

706
01:22:15.082 --> 01:22:19.082
<i>The chocolate. I mean.
Not the shovel. that was ours.</i>

707
01:22:27.207 --> 01:22:31.248
<i>I have to admit that the liquor
chocolates the old couple gave</i>

708
01:22:31.249 --> 01:22:33.707
<i>tasted terrible.</i>

709
01:22:34.624 --> 01:22:38.999
<i>I heard Jiikoo's dog ate them
and got terrible diarrhea.</i>

710
01:22:39.707 --> 01:22:42.707
<i>Jiikoo had to clean up the whole house.</i>

711
01:22:42.707 --> 01:22:46.373
<i>I gave them to my dad.
but didn't have to clean up.</i>

712
01:22:56.249 --> 01:22:58.540
Pumpputie 42.

713
01:23:03.457 --> 01:23:06.498
That is the murder weapon.
-Let's go and have a look.

714
01:24:17.999 --> 01:24:22.499
The other one is Jiikoo.
They are ok. but kind of weird.

715
01:24:23.207 --> 01:24:25.457
Are you ok. boys?

716
01:24:25.457 --> 01:24:29.040
You shouldn't scream so long.
or you'll faint.

717
01:24:31.332 --> 01:24:35.040
You are under arrest
for a serious crime. -What?

718
01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:39.541
This is damning evidence.
And this is another one.

719
01:24:40.207 --> 01:24:42.665
Where did you get these?

720
01:24:42.666 --> 01:24:47.166
I think they dropped when we moved here.
-Dad!

721
01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:51.040
How do you explain this bloody axe?
-Bloody?

722
01:24:51.041 --> 01:24:53.707
Let's hear it.

723
01:24:53.707 --> 01:24:56.873
Well. I guess I have to admit.

724
01:24:57.832 --> 01:25:01.332
<i>We moved to Pumpputie quite recently.</i>

725
01:25:01.332 --> 01:25:05.832
<i>One night. quite late. I was bringing
some of our things here before the move.</i>

726
01:25:06.082 --> 01:25:09.540
<i>I only noticed the next day
that stuff had dropped.</i>

727
01:25:09.832 --> 01:25:12.415
<i>and found the axe on the road.</i>

728
01:25:14.041 --> 01:25:18.124
But I cleaned the paint from the tarmac.

729
01:25:18.124 --> 01:25:19.707
Paint.

730
01:25:21.291 --> 01:25:23.916
So I'm not under arrest?
-My apologies.

731
01:25:23.916 --> 01:25:26.832
There was a misunderstanding.

732
01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:31.790
Great that you cleaned up
after yourself.

733
01:25:31.791 --> 01:25:33.874
so there are no consequences.

734
01:25:34.332 --> 01:25:37.165
And we are sorry.

735
01:25:37.166 --> 01:25:39.916
I was worried for a bit.

736
01:25:39.916 --> 01:25:43.791
But you are quite nice boys.

737
01:25:43.791 --> 01:25:47.999
Are you the penpals of Sisko-Kaarina?

738
01:25:47.999 --> 01:25:50.707
Dad. come on.

739
01:25:50.707 --> 01:25:53.290
What penpals?
-I mean those notes.

740
01:25:53.291 --> 01:25:55.499
Dad. stop it.

741
01:26:02.374 --> 01:26:05.249
I have a confession to make.

742
01:26:20.499 --> 01:26:21.832
Oh it was you.

743
01:26:21.832 --> 01:26:25.623
I meant to tell at school.
but it was so fun following you.

744
01:26:25.624 --> 01:26:29.957
Without your help we would not
have found the missing mailboxes.

745
01:26:29.957 --> 01:26:31.248
Oh. the mailbox.

746
01:26:35.666 --> 01:26:37.499
What are you staring at?

747
01:26:38.916 --> 01:26:43.416
Sorry. You fly that thing very well.

748
01:26:44.957 --> 01:26:45.915
Thanks.

749
01:26:54.541 --> 01:26:59.041
This is for you. Without you
we would not have solved this.

750
01:27:04.374 --> 01:27:06.374
Cool medal.

751
01:27:06.374 --> 01:27:08.832
Jiikoo. stop staring

752
01:27:08.832 --> 01:27:13.040
and salute the air force chief
of the Southern Lahti FBI.

753
01:27:14.791 --> 01:27:17.457
Welcome to the team. Well done.

754
01:27:23.666 --> 01:27:25.666
I think this is yours.

755
01:27:25.666 --> 01:27:28.166
Well I'll be... It is.

756
01:27:28.166 --> 01:27:32.332
We accept chocolate as a reward
for returning the mailbox.

757
01:27:32.332 --> 01:27:35.040
But no liquor chocolates.

758
01:27:35.041 --> 01:27:36.749
Reward...

759
01:27:36.749 --> 01:27:41.249
Well. I don't think we have
chocolate right at the moment -

760
01:27:43.166 --> 01:27:46.666
but how about a tandem flight?

761
01:27:46.666 --> 01:27:49.457
Paragliding is quite safe and fun.

762
01:27:49.457 --> 01:27:51.040
<i>Safe and fun.</i>

763
01:28:00.124 --> 01:28:04.624
I mean... Now that we have
new equipment for flying.

764
01:28:10.874 --> 01:28:12.165
But ...

765
01:28:13.916 --> 01:28:15.791
What?

766
01:28:16.749 --> 01:28:20.874
<i>I'm afraid of heights</i>

767
01:28:23.999 --> 01:28:26.707
<i>And I'm afraid of water</i>

768
01:28:27.874 --> 01:28:30.207
<i>I'm afraid</i>

769
01:28:30.207 --> 01:28:34.707
<i>I will be alone
Without anyone</i>

770
01:28:39.166 --> 01:28:43.666
<i>I'm afraid of these good folks</i>

771
01:28:43.999 --> 01:28:48.499
<i>And their barbed talks</i>

772
01:28:53.749 --> 01:28:57.540
<i>I'm afraid of dying</i>

773
01:28:57.541 --> 01:29:01.416
<i>I'm afraid of living</i>

774
01:29:01.416 --> 01:29:05.916
<i>I'm afraid of the darkness of the wood</i>

775
01:29:06.249 --> 01:29:10.749
<i>Afraid I don't see good</i>

776
01:29:12.166 --> 01:29:16.666
<i>I'm afraid of a dream</i>

777
01:29:17.332 --> 01:29:21.832
<i>That is merely a gleam</i>

778
01:29:28.957 --> 01:29:32.707
We are all sometimes
afraid of something.

779
01:29:32.707 --> 01:29:34.915
That is quite normal.

780
01:29:34.916 --> 01:29:38.916
But remember. Henkka.
that fear is only in here.

781
01:29:40.207 --> 01:29:42.623
And you have the power to overcome it.

782
01:30:24.916 --> 01:30:28.291
<i>Throw away your sad thoughts</i>

783
01:30:28.291 --> 01:30:31.541
<i>Rip your fears to shreds</i>

784
01:30:31.541 --> 01:30:34.582
<i>Hold your head up high</i>

785
01:30:34.582 --> 01:30:38.332
<i>And sing this song of courage</i>

786
01:30:38.332 --> 01:30:42.123
<i>Throw away your sad thoughts</i>

787
01:30:42.124 --> 01:30:45.499
<i>Rip your fears to shreds</i>

788
01:30:45.499 --> 01:30:48.749
<i>Hold your head up high</i>

789
01:30:48.749 --> 01:30:52.290
<i>And sing this song of courage</i>

790
01:30:52.291 --> 01:30:55.791
<i>Always</i>

791
01:31:14.499 --> 01:31:16.790
Hi. Kauko!

792
01:31:19.791 --> 01:31:22.957
<i>Throw away your sad thoughts</i>

793
01:31:22.957 --> 01:31:26.707
<i>Rip your fears to shreds</i>

794
01:31:26.707 --> 01:31:30.082
<i>Hold your head up high</i>

795
01:31:30.082 --> 01:31:33.415
<i>And sing this song of courage</i>

796
01:31:33.416 --> 01:31:36.624
<i>Always</i>

797
01:31:38.749 --> 01:31:41.290
That was so cool.

798
01:31:41.291 --> 01:31:44.499
From up there you could see
the radio towers. the ski jumping hills.

799
01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:48.665
the city hall. The whole city.

800
01:31:48.666 --> 01:31:51.416
And I guess all of southern Finland.

801
01:31:51.416 --> 01:31:55.916
The topic of this paper
was meant to be: "What do I fear?"

802
01:31:56.291 --> 01:32:00.791
I feel it is wrong.
because fears are meant to be conquered.

803
01:32:01.707 --> 01:32:06.207
I was afraid of heights.
but I conquered my fear.

804
01:32:06.332 --> 01:32:10.832
Being afraid is normal.
but it can be overcome.

805
01:32:11.249 --> 01:32:15.749
Remember that you are
the hero of your own life.

806
01:32:15.791 --> 01:32:20.291
This paper is titled: "I am not afraid."

807
01:32:28.499 --> 01:32:31.624
<i>Throw away your sad thoughts</i>

808
01:32:31.624 --> 01:32:35.332
<i>Rip your fears to shreds</i>

809
01:32:35.332 --> 01:32:38.040
<i>Hold your head up high</i>

810
01:32:38.041 --> 01:32:41.957
<i>And sing this song of courage</i>

811
01:32:41.957 --> 01:32:45.707
<i>Always</i>

812
