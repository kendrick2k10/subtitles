00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:10.947
I assume she escaped your grasp. Axel.

4
00:33:11.364 --> 00:33:12.991
Yes. your excellency.

5
00:33:13.282 --> 00:33:16.661
Then I'll take care of it myself.

6
00:33:17.704 --> 00:33:20.832
The Tree is the key to
Germany winning this war.

7
00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:31.342
The Arrowhead will show us the way
to the Tree.

8
00:33:31.426 --> 00:33:33.886
We cannot let it leave this harbor.

9
00:33:34.053 --> 00:33:35.054
Surface!

10
01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:51.207
She's being weird about the Arrowhead.

11
01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.127
She's extremely difficult.

12
01:01:57.422 --> 01:01:58.631
It's hard to be around her.

13
01:02:01.175 --> 01:02:03.594
She doesn't mind if you kill her.

14
01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:08.474
Just don't kill me.

15
01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:18.844
You seem surprised.

16
01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:27.436
After 400 years...

17
01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.771
The Arrowhead...

18
01:08:28.896 --> 01:08:29.897
...belongs to me.

19
01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:33.943
Save your family!

20
01:08:34.026 --> 01:08:35.027
Yes!

21
01:12:15.956 --> 01:12:16.957
I have her!

22
01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:20.085
Give me the Arrowhead!

23
01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.756
Aguirre. we're too far from the river!

24
01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:55.579
Did you see the Arrowhead?

25
01:12:56.413 --> 01:12:57.414
Have you really seen it?

26
01:12:57.498 --> 01:12:59.750
Not only have I seen it.
I held it in my hands.

27
01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:01.293
Finally we can break the curse...

28
01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.003
and Francisco shall pay.

29
01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:05.547
Forget about Francisco!
The Arrowhead. Aguirre!

30
01:13:06.006 --> 01:13:09.259
Only the Tears of the Moon can help us get
out of this curse.

31
01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.595
This jungle is devouring our souls.

32
01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.389
We are disgusting.

33
01:13:14.264 --> 01:13:16.183
Speak for yourself. I am delicious.

34
01:13:18.143 --> 01:13:20.646
Do you really believe we still have souls?

35
01:13:21.146 --> 01:13:25.234
That's why we need the Tears of the Moon.
they are our only hope.

36
01:13:25.442 --> 01:13:28.028
The woman in pants has the Arrowhead...

37
01:13:28.195 --> 01:13:29.905
and has taken it away from the river.

38
01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:31.907
Because she knows we can't
follow her there.

39
01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:33.242
The Prince.

40
01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:37.454
He can follow the Arrowhead.

41
01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:39.456
Tell him where she went.

42
01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:40.958
You heard him.

43
01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:42.751
Tell the Prince.

44
01:19:33.059 --> 01:19:34.478
I will travel far.

45
01:19:35.645 --> 01:19:37.773
But I will come back to you
with a Tear of the Moon.

46
01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:41.276
And you will run again in the moonlight.

47
01:19:41.359 --> 01:19:42.360
Healed.

48
01:21:22.752 --> 01:21:24.421
You are not worthy.

49
01:21:40.645 --> 01:21:41.771
She has the Arrowhead!

50
01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:47.485
I'm not going to hurt you.

51
01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.154
I only want the Arrowhead.

52
01:21:51.114 --> 01:21:52.115
Give it to me!

53
01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:56.077
Run!

54
01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:00.749
A brother's blade cuts deepest.

55
01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:02.292
Traitor.

56
01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:32.030
Where did she go?

57
01:22:32.238 --> 01:22:33.448
She can't be far!

58
01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:11.528
The river!

59
01:23:11.778 --> 01:23:12.779
Where is it?

60
01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.491
We have to get out of here!

61
01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:31.214
Francisco. you will pay for this!

62
01:36:36.582 --> 01:36:37.583
Take them away.

63
01:46:24.002 --> 01:46:25.796
It looks like
you haven't been very nice...

64
01:46:25.921 --> 01:46:28.006
to my little friends.

65
01:46:43.355 --> 01:46:45.065
Aguirre. the woman in pants...

66
01:46:48.026 --> 01:46:49.111
Get her!

67
01:46:59.413 --> 01:47:00.539
Francisco has the petal!

68
01:47:03.291 --> 01:47:04.334
Stop him!

69
01:48:46.102 --> 01:48:47.270
He has the petal in his pocket!

70
01:50:00.218 --> 01:50:01.678
Stop the boat! Stop it!
