3
00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:35.756
Mom?

4
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.467
You need to redirect.

5
00:44:42.179 --> 00:44:43.889
Mom. please redirect.

6
00:45:22.344 --> 00:45:23.262
Object to form.

7
00:50:40.537 --> 00:50:43.457
Could you tell me a little about
you and your wife's relationship?

8
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.375
You know. it's like any marriage.

9
00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:46.418
You've got your ups and downs.

10
00:50:46.501 --> 00:50:50.130
And sure. you're not gonna
agree on everything. you know?

11
00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:52.966
Do you guys ever disagree on Maya's care?

12
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:55.343
No. and I know my wife.

13
00:50:55.427 --> 00:50:59.639
She'll stay up till three in the morning.
you know. doing research or whatever.

14
00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:03.935
I kind of listen to what she says
with that and the doctors.

15
00:51:04.019 --> 00:51:06.354
Number one is the doctors.

16
00:51:06.438 --> 00:51:10.317
Is Maya looking for some attention
from her mom?

17
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.735
Trying to please her mom?

18
00:51:11.818 --> 00:51:12.778
Mom wants her to be sick.

19
00:51:12.861 --> 00:51:14.613
-so I'm going to be sick to please my mom.
-I hope not.

20
00:51:14.696 --> 00:51:16.073
God. I hope not.

21
00:51:19.326 --> 00:51:24.790
Let's not differentiate love and affection
and caring for abuse.

22
00:51:24.873 --> 00:51:26.083
Because they can happen in tandem.

23
00:51:26.166 --> 00:51:27.000
Yeah.

24
00:51:27.709 --> 00:51:31.046
I don't agree with her on a lot of things.
but I'll tell you what.

25
00:51:31.129 --> 00:51:33.757
intentionally. she would never
hurt her children.

26
00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:36.593
I'd swear on my life on that one.

27
00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:38.595
Do you love your wife?

28
00:51:38.678 --> 00:51:39.971
I love her. yeah.

29
00:51:40.555 --> 00:51:41.389
I just…

30
00:51:42.724 --> 00:51:44.935
She is a pushy person

31
00:51:45.018 --> 00:51:46.978
and it's getting worse right now.

32
00:51:47.062 --> 00:51:50.023
Just. you know.
she don't want to cooperate.

33
00:51:51.733 --> 00:51:53.151
This is a complicated case.

34
00:51:54.194 --> 00:51:57.823
And I think it could be very possible

35
00:51:57.906 --> 00:51:59.741
that someone could be looking
at criminal charges.

36
00:52:01.576 --> 00:52:04.663
Which is why I'm asking you.
are you protective or are you complicit?

37
00:52:05.455 --> 00:52:06.790
Protective of my children.

38
00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:10.293
Are your children
truly your first priority?

39
00:52:10.377 --> 00:52:13.380
I swear on my life.
on my children's lives.

40
00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:15.924
I don't care. I'll put you
and your wife in jail tomorrow

41
00:52:16.007 --> 00:52:17.509
-if it meant Maya stays better.
-If I did something wrong.

42
00:52:17.592 --> 00:52:18.510
you'd put me in jail.

43
00:52:18.593 --> 00:52:20.804
-Absolutely.
-Yes. I accept that.

44
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:24.891
Let me ask you.
If Maya was released tomorrow

45
00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:27.310
would you be compliant

46
00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:30.897
if that child was not to have
any contact with her mother?

47
00:52:31.523 --> 00:52:32.440
Yes.

48
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:35.193
In a heartbeat.

49
01:00:02.515 --> 01:00:03.766
Oh. my God!

50
01:00:05.059 --> 01:00:06.811
I'm so sorry.

51
01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:12.233
I'm so sorry…

52
01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:15.737
I feel so bad. the judge was so cold.

53
01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:40.197
Heartless bastards.

54
01:33:42.867 --> 01:33:45.119
They're just going
to continue to beat us up.

55
01:33:48.331 --> 01:33:49.665
They don't give a shit.

56
01:33:50.833 --> 01:33:53.753
Please stop talking?
I don't want to hear it anymore.
