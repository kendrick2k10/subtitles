3
00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:20.107
Please! Please. stop!

4
00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:27.549
No!

5
00:01:18.252 --> 00:01:20.167
Come on. Jordyn. come join me.

6
00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:23.518
You could've pulled up
further. Mom.

7
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.086
I know.

8
00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:27.913
I guess I find it
hard to believe

9
00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:29.611
it's really ours. you know?

10
00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:33.310
I bet there's dead bodies
in the basement.

11
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:34.572
Oh. Jordyn.

12
00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:36.313
Or the previous owner died

13
00:01:36.444 --> 00:01:38.271
under mysterious circumstances.

14
00:01:38.402 --> 00:01:41.013
No. he just fell behind
on payments

15
00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:42.537
and the bank foreclosed.

16
00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:49.152
I heard it was your big day.

17
00:01:49.283 --> 00:01:50.719
Yeah.

18
00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:51.894
Oh. Kendall Jones.

19
00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:53.025
We met briefly at the bank.

20
00:01:53.156 --> 00:01:54.636
I'm a local realtor.

21
00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:57.029
Oh. hi. yeah.
Uh. this is my daughter. Jordyn.

22
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.335
Oh. hi. Jordyn.

23
00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:00.642
I wanted to bring
something for you.

24
00:02:02.383 --> 00:02:03.558
Welcome to the neighborhood.

25
00:02:03.688 --> 00:02:04.950
Thank you.

26
00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:06.474
If you need help with anything.

27
00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:07.866
just let me know.

28
00:02:07.997 --> 00:02:08.866
We should have lunch sometime.

29
00:02:08.997 --> 00:02:10.130
Sure.

30
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.740
How about you get settled in

31
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.524
and then give me a call?

32
00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:14.656
Wonderful. thanks.

33
00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:16.005
All right. take care.

34
00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.311
See ya.

35
00:02:26.755 --> 00:02:30.019
Oh. looks even bigger
than I remember it.

36
00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:39.724
Uh. Mom.
why is there furniture here?

37
00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:43.293
Because the previous owner
sold it with the house.

38
00:02:43.424 --> 00:02:45.295
If the guy couldn't make
the mortgage payments.

39
00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.558
why didn't he sell some of it?

40
00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.605
I don't know.
But aren't we lucky?

41
00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:52.172
It's beautiful.

42
00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:55.175
Oh.

43
00:02:56.393 --> 00:02:59.048
That must be the movers.
Be right back.

44
00:04:00.283 --> 00:04:04.418
Huh. weird.

45
00:04:32.837 --> 00:04:34.317
What?

46
00:04:34.448 --> 00:04:35.231
Huh?

47
00:04:35.362 --> 00:04:36.580
I said. "What?"

48
00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:38.626
As in. what are you looking at?

49
00:04:38.756 --> 00:04:41.977
Oh. is this some
sort of movie reference?

50
00:04:42.107 --> 00:04:43.021
You want me to guess? Um--

51
00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:44.719
Oh. please go.

52
00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.764
Oh. wait. I...

53
00:04:46.895 --> 00:04:48.636
How about we start again?

54
00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:51.159
I'm Noah. Noah Ryan.

55
00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:54.250
Jordyn Wilson.

56
00:04:54.381 --> 00:04:55.773
Lovely to meet you.
Jordyn Wilson.

57
00:04:55.904 --> 00:04:56.818
Did you just move here?

58
00:04:56.948 --> 00:04:58.254
Yup.

59
00:04:58.385 --> 00:05:00.125
You going to Memorial High?

60
00:05:00.256 --> 00:05:02.302
How'd you ever guess?

61
00:05:02.432 --> 00:05:03.825
You don't seem
too happy about it.

62
00:05:03.955 --> 00:05:04.956
Why wouldn't I be happy?

63
00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:06.306
Isn't it every girl's dream

64
00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:08.873
to be dropped
into a new high school

65
00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:10.614
in the middle of her senior year

66
00:05:10.745 --> 00:05:11.876
knowing no one?

67
00:05:12.007 --> 00:05:13.530
That's not true.

68
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:15.053
What's not?

69
00:05:15.184 --> 00:05:16.838
You know me.

70
00:05:16.968 --> 00:05:18.970
Terrific.

71
00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:19.841
So I'll see you tomorrow.

72
00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:20.842
On the bus?

73
00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:22.060
Bus?

74
00:05:22.191 --> 00:05:24.149
Nobody takes the bus.

75
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.586
How do you get to school?

76
00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:27.196
I drive.

77
00:05:28.457 --> 00:05:30.591
I'll be by at 8:00
to pick you up.

78
00:05:40.992 --> 00:05:42.080
I know you like to give me
a hard time

79
00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:43.691
about rarely cooking.

80
00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:45.345
but even you have to admit
this is way better

81
00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:46.868
than anything I could make.

82
00:05:48.913 --> 00:05:50.872
Come on. Jordyn.
It's our first night here.

83
00:05:51.002 --> 00:05:53.091
So?

84
00:05:53.222 --> 00:05:54.919
New house. new start?

85
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.096
I just don't understand
why we had to leave.

86
00:05:58.227 --> 00:05:59.533
I didn't want to.

87
00:05:59.663 --> 00:06:02.231
No. I'd say
we both needed a change.

88
00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.755
Well. I didn't ask them
to suspend me.

89
00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:06.844
You didn't have to.
Vaping on school property.

90
00:06:06.975 --> 00:06:08.498
after they had already given you
a warning--

91
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:11.588
It was just one hit. barely one.

92
00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.416
Okay. A suspension isn't exactly

93
00:06:13.547 --> 00:06:16.114
a badge of honor
on a college transcript.

94
00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:18.595
Who says
I even wanna go to college?

95
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:21.119
Okay. Can we not have
this conversation?

96
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.425
Not tonight.

97
00:06:22.556 --> 00:06:24.558
I'm not the one
who brought it up.

98
00:06:25.733 --> 00:06:27.430
Look. your dad and I always said

99
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:28.736
that you could pick
any career you want

100
00:06:28.866 --> 00:06:30.955
as long as you go
to college first.

101
00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:33.567
Well. at least you guys agreed
on one thing.

102
00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:37.266
Have you talked to him recently?

103
00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.311
Who. Frank?

104
00:06:39.442 --> 00:06:41.662
Yes. your dad.

105
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.404
Nope.

106
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.973
So. are you excited
for tomorrow?

107
00:06:49.104 --> 00:06:50.409
First day of school.

108
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.063
Were you planning
on taking my picture

109
00:06:52.194 --> 00:06:53.630
and walking me to the bus stop?

110
00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:55.980
I was gonna offer you a ride.

111
00:06:56.111 --> 00:06:58.722
Actually. I already have one.

112
00:06:58.853 --> 00:06:59.767
What do you mean?

113
00:06:59.897 --> 00:07:02.596
A ride for tomorrow.

114
00:07:02.726 --> 00:07:04.162
I make friends quickly. Mom.

115
00:07:04.293 --> 00:07:06.904
That's what you wanted.
isn't it?

116
00:07:07.035 --> 00:07:08.297
Save the rest of my pizza

117
00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.430
so I can eat it
for breakfast. please?

118
00:07:11.735 --> 00:07:13.737
Uh-hmm.

119
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.428
Jordyn?

120
00:09:17.078 --> 00:09:18.949
What?

121
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.516
Couldn't you wear something
a little less black

122
00:09:20.647 --> 00:09:22.344
on your first day?

123
00:09:22.474 --> 00:09:24.868
It's not my first day.
It's the middle of my last year.

124
00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:27.697
Can I make you something to eat?
Toast you something?

125
00:09:27.828 --> 00:09:29.743
No. I'll have my pizza cold.

126
00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:34.486
Did you hear
anything last night?

127
00:09:34.617 --> 00:09:35.836
Mom. where's my pizza?

128
00:09:35.966 --> 00:09:37.098
It's in tin foil.

129
00:09:37.228 --> 00:09:38.534
A creaking
in the middle of the night.

130
00:09:38.665 --> 00:09:39.970
did you hear that?

131
00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:41.363
No idea
what you're talking about.

132
00:09:41.493 --> 00:09:43.104
And--and the pizza's not here.

133
00:09:43.234 --> 00:09:44.845
It's on the bottom shelf.

134
00:09:47.412 --> 00:09:49.153
Huh.

135
00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:51.765
I wonder who that is.

136
00:09:51.895 --> 00:09:53.810
I told you. I have a ride.

137
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:56.596
Oh. I thought you were joking.

138
00:09:59.381 --> 00:10:00.730
Can I meet whoever it is?

139
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:03.341
I don't wanna be late
on my first day. Mom.

140
00:10:03.472 --> 00:10:04.516
But. Jordyn. I--

141
00:10:04.647 --> 00:10:06.170
-Hey.
-Hi.

142
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:07.650
But. Jordyn. I just...

143
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.480
-Uh. shouldn't I say hello?
-No.

144
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.438
- Oh.
- Let's go.

145
00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:15.615
Have a great day.
you guys.

146
00:10:17.442 --> 00:10:19.053
Hmm.

147
00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:29.933
Hey. Let's see about that.

148
00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:32.588
Oh. I'm sorry. I...I'm slammed.

149
00:10:32.719 --> 00:10:34.024
I will get to the numbers
by the end of the day.

150
00:10:34.155 --> 00:10:35.460
Oh my gosh.
to hell with the numbers.

151
00:10:35.591 --> 00:10:37.245
tell me about the house.

152
00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:40.465
Well. there's not much to tell.
I mean. you saw it.

153
00:10:40.596 --> 00:10:43.251
Came with some furniture.
And now we're just unpacking.

154
00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:45.296
you know. trying to make it
feel like ours.

155
00:10:45.427 --> 00:10:47.037
But you like it. right?

156
00:10:47.168 --> 00:10:50.084
I love it. I mean. Lucy.
I have an indoor pool.

157
00:10:50.214 --> 00:10:53.827
I know. Which I can't wait
to swim in

158
00:10:53.957 --> 00:10:55.611
it's a big step up
from that hovel

159
00:10:55.742 --> 00:10:57.569
the two of you used to live in.

160
00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.441
Our house was quaint.

161
00:10:59.571 --> 00:11:02.226
It was a disaster.

162
00:11:02.357 --> 00:11:04.533
And Ms. Jordyn. what does
she have to say about it?

163
00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.056
You know Jordyn.

164
00:11:06.187 --> 00:11:07.884
I mean. we could moving
into the Taj Mahal

165
00:11:08.015 --> 00:11:09.320
and she would feel put out.

166
00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:10.844
Well. you deserve a medal.

167
00:11:10.974 --> 00:11:11.888
Why?

168
00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:13.411
You threw your hat into the ring

169
00:11:13.542 --> 00:11:14.804
and worked hard for a promotion.

170
00:11:14.935 --> 00:11:16.676
All while shopping for a house

171
00:11:16.806 --> 00:11:18.721
so you two could have
a new start.

172
00:11:18.852 --> 00:11:20.897
I'm just doing
what any mother would do.

173
00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:22.769
- Uh-hmm.
- Just trying to give us

174
00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:25.641
-a better life.
-Hmm. with no help from Frank.

175
00:11:25.772 --> 00:11:27.208
Not like he'd know how to.

176
00:11:27.338 --> 00:11:29.863
Oh. I am just happy
that I don't have

177
00:11:29.993 --> 00:11:32.126
to listen
to his abusive criticism.

178
00:11:32.256 --> 00:11:34.824
you know. or wonder
what his ulterior motives are.

179
00:11:34.955 --> 00:11:36.783
Oh. my gosh. he was exhausting.

180
00:11:36.913 --> 00:11:38.306
Have you heard from him?

181
00:11:38.436 --> 00:11:40.395
Not a word. surprisingly.

182
00:11:40.525 --> 00:11:44.442
Well. enjoy it. the job.
the house. all of it.

183
00:11:44.573 --> 00:11:46.140
- Uh-hmm.
- You deserve it.

184
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.142
Hey. Sara. here's those numbers
that you asked for.

185
00:11:48.272 --> 00:11:49.796
Thank you.

186
00:11:49.926 --> 00:11:52.059
Okay. I better get back
to this report.

187
00:11:52.189 --> 00:11:53.974
I took a half-day so I could
be home for Jordyn today.

188
00:11:54.104 --> 00:11:56.237
-Oh. that's sweet. Okay.
-Okay. Bye.

189
00:12:35.624 --> 00:12:37.104
No. Okay.

190
00:12:37.234 --> 00:12:39.106
Wow.

191
00:12:56.993 --> 00:12:58.038
Oh.

192
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.997
What'd you do with your key?

193
00:13:01.128 --> 00:13:04.305
I'm sorry.
You were expecting someone else.

194
00:13:04.435 --> 00:13:05.959
Yeah. my daughter.

195
00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:08.091
Oh. uh. well.
I won't keep you long.

196
00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:10.267
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

197
00:13:10.398 --> 00:13:12.443
I'm Colin Murray.

198
00:13:12.574 --> 00:13:15.142
Hey. Sara. Uh. Sara Wilson.

199
00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:19.494
Um. can I help you?

200
00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:22.497
Yeah. you live in my house.

201
00:13:22.627 --> 00:13:24.847
I mean.
I've lived in your house.

202
00:13:24.978 --> 00:13:28.285
I mean. you bought my old house.

203
00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:30.157
Oh. yeah. you're the guy?

204
00:13:30.287 --> 00:13:33.377
Yeah. yeah.
I was in between jobs

205
00:13:33.508 --> 00:13:36.032
and I put all my savings
into maintenance. so...

206
00:13:36.163 --> 00:13:38.556
Well. you kept the place
in great shape.

207
00:13:38.687 --> 00:13:40.863
I mean. I can't believe
it's a hundred years old.

208
00:13:40.994 --> 00:13:42.430
Those wood doors
off the living room.

209
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.911
they're gorgeous.

210
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.261
Wow. I'm so happy
you appreciate the place.

211
00:13:47.391 --> 00:13:50.046
Yeah. right.

212
00:13:50.177 --> 00:13:52.309
Well. uh. I just...
yeah. I just wanted

213
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.443
to introduce myself like I said
and I'm a contractor.

214
00:13:55.573 --> 00:13:57.575
so if you have any questions
or need anything.

215
00:13:57.706 --> 00:13:59.403
please. uh. feel free to call.

216
00:13:59.534 --> 00:14:01.188
That's my number.

217
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.063
Look. I'm sorry.

218
00:14:07.194 --> 00:14:08.630
I. uh...

219
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.631
I didn't just live in the house.

220
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:10.588
I grew up in it.

221
00:14:10.719 --> 00:14:13.156
My grandfather built it.

222
00:14:13.287 --> 00:14:14.592
Oh.

223
00:14:14.723 --> 00:14:15.593
Yeah. the. uh.
wooden doors

224
00:14:15.724 --> 00:14:17.639
are from Barcelona.

225
00:14:17.769 --> 00:14:19.336
He built the house
during Prohibition

226
00:14:19.467 --> 00:14:22.209
and there even used to be
a Speakeasy in the basement.

227
00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:24.472
It's not still down there.
is it?

228
00:14:24.602 --> 00:14:26.126
Um. no.

229
00:14:26.256 --> 00:14:28.215
No. the--the swimming pool area
consumed it.

230
00:14:28.345 --> 00:14:29.912
Oh.

231
00:14:30.043 --> 00:14:31.566
But when I was little.
there were cubbies

232
00:14:31.696 --> 00:14:33.611
and secret doors hiding
where they kept the alcohol.

233
00:14:33.742 --> 00:14:35.135
How interesting.

234
00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:38.007
I have a lot of good memories
in this place.

235
00:14:38.138 --> 00:14:41.619
I just wanna make sure
it's. uh. taken care of.

236
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.273
Yeah. of course.

237
00:14:43.404 --> 00:14:45.319
Oh! I--I did have one question
for you.

238
00:14:45.449 --> 00:14:48.757
Um. I just heard
something in the walls.

239
00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.325
You didn't have a pest problem.
did you?

240
00:14:51.455 --> 00:14:52.326
It sounded pretty big.

241
00:14:52.456 --> 00:14:56.199
Uh. no. I didn't.

242
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.855
Okay. Well. we sure do love
the place. my daughter and I.

243
00:14:59.986 --> 00:15:01.639
We'll do our best
to take good care of it.

244
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.554
Well. I won't keep you
any longer.

245
00:15:03.685 --> 00:15:06.427
You have my number.
Please feel free to use it.

246
00:15:06.557 --> 00:15:08.429
Thank you.

247
00:15:31.278 --> 00:15:32.496
Thanks.

248
00:15:32.627 --> 00:15:34.020
No problem.
You're right on my way home.

249
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.979
I mean for everything.

250
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.851
You made my first day
a lot easier.

251
00:15:39.982 --> 00:15:41.897
And also for the pizza.

252
00:15:42.028 --> 00:15:44.508
Oh. well. that was just me
doing my duty as a citizen.

253
00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:47.033
You can't move here
and not eat at Angelo's.

254
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:51.254
I better get going.
My mom is probably

255
00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:53.213
glued to the front door waiting.

256
00:15:53.343 --> 00:15:54.692
Yeah. Yeah. okay.

257
00:15:54.823 --> 00:15:56.129
Uh-hmm.

258
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.091
Listen. like I said.
I appreciate all this.

259
00:16:02.222 --> 00:16:04.615
but I don't want you to think

260
00:16:04.746 --> 00:16:05.834
the new girl is just some easy--

261
00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.227
Uh. Jordyn.

262
00:16:07.357 --> 00:16:09.533
no. I--I swear.
Not for one second.

263
00:16:12.841 --> 00:16:14.495
I'll see you tomorrow.

264
00:16:16.453 --> 00:16:18.412
What are you doing?

265
00:16:18.542 --> 00:16:21.502
There was this guy standing
by the side of your house.

266
00:16:21.632 --> 00:16:23.504
He took off around the back.

267
00:16:23.634 --> 00:16:25.723
What did he look like?

268
00:16:25.854 --> 00:16:27.421
I don't know.
It happened so fast.

269
00:16:27.551 --> 00:16:30.293
Maybe someone from
the electric company or gas.

270
00:16:30.424 --> 00:16:32.730
No. No uniform.

271
00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:34.602
And why would he run?

272
00:16:34.732 --> 00:16:36.952
I don't know.

273
00:16:37.083 --> 00:16:38.910
My mom. she's in the house.

274
00:16:51.662 --> 00:16:54.361
Hey! Why don't you
let me go first. okay?

275
00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:17.471
He had plenty of time
to get away.

276
00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:18.559
Get away where?

277
00:17:18.689 --> 00:17:20.343
I don't know.

278
00:17:20.473 --> 00:17:21.431
Into the woods over there.
or he could have gone back

279
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:23.346
around the house
on the other side.

280
00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:26.001
Either way. he's not here now.

281
00:17:26.132 --> 00:17:28.221
Let's just make sure. okay?

282
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:37.969
I mean. we looked everywhere.

283
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.015
But if I were you.
I'd still tell your mom.

284
00:17:40.146 --> 00:17:43.671
I will. but I don't know
what she's gonna do about it.

285
00:17:43.801 --> 00:17:45.151
You didn't get
a good look at him.

286
00:17:45.281 --> 00:17:46.717
He moved too quickly.

287
00:17:48.632 --> 00:17:49.938
God. Mom!

288
00:17:50.852 --> 00:17:53.072
I'm sorry.
I just heard you guys talking.

289
00:17:55.552 --> 00:17:56.858
Mom. this is Noah.

290
00:17:56.988 --> 00:17:58.381
Uh. hello. Mrs. Wilson.

291
00:17:58.512 --> 00:17:59.730
I just live down the road.

292
00:17:59.861 --> 00:18:01.210
Oh. it's nice to meet you. Noah.

293
00:18:01.341 --> 00:18:02.429
Why don't you guys come inside?

294
00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:04.735
Uh. he can't.
He has to get going.

295
00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:07.042
Yes. I--I--I have to get going.

296
00:18:07.173 --> 00:18:09.784
Hmm. Could I ask a favor
before you go?

297
00:18:09.914 --> 00:18:10.828
Yes. ma'am.

298
00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:12.439
Super!

299
00:18:15.398 --> 00:18:16.791
Little bit left.
and then take it

300
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:18.749
back just another inch.
and then down.

301
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.534
And just straight.

302
00:18:20.664 --> 00:18:22.405
Oh. thank you. you guys.

303
00:18:22.536 --> 00:18:24.886
Why are we moving it?
It looked fine before.

304
00:18:25.016 --> 00:18:27.367
Oh. I just wanna make
the space feel new.

305
00:18:27.497 --> 00:18:29.238
Yeah. it looks good.

306
00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:30.457
Thank you. Noah.

307
00:18:30.587 --> 00:18:32.502
So I'll pick you up
tomorrow morning?

308
00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:34.548
Sure.

309
00:18:35.984 --> 00:18:37.116
Okay.

310
00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:41.859
Nice to meet you. Ms. Wilson.

311
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.339
Oh. you as well.

312
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.646
- See you tomorrow. Jordyn.
- Bye.

313
00:18:48.039 --> 00:18:49.215
He seems nice.

314
00:18:49.345 --> 00:18:50.477
I guess.

315
00:18:50.607 --> 00:18:51.826
Oh. don't give me
that "I guess."

316
00:18:51.956 --> 00:18:53.306
I saw the way
you were looking at him.

317
00:18:53.436 --> 00:18:55.308
Mom. he's the only person
I know here.

318
00:18:55.438 --> 00:18:56.439
so I let him give me a ride.

319
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.225
-That's it.
-Uh-huh.

320
00:18:59.355 --> 00:19:00.878
So how was school?

321
00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:06.014
Um. Mom. how long
have you been here?

322
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.798
What do you mean?
Here at the house?

323
00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:10.279
Maybe an hour and a half. Why?

324
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.674
Did you...hear anything?

325
00:19:13.804 --> 00:19:15.023
Yeah. I heard your voices.

326
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:16.851
That's why I opened
the front door.

327
00:19:16.981 --> 00:19:20.028
No. no. no. Before that.
Did you hear anything else?

328
00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:24.075
I think I might've heard
some rodents in the walls.

329
00:19:24.206 --> 00:19:25.294
But don't worry.

330
00:19:25.425 --> 00:19:27.078
I'm calling the exterminator.

331
00:19:27.209 --> 00:19:28.341
Why?

332
00:19:28.471 --> 00:19:30.386
Well. when Noah pulled up.

333
00:19:30.517 --> 00:19:34.695
he saw some guy lurking
around the side of the house.

334
00:19:34.825 --> 00:19:37.828
Okay. Well. the previous owner
came by

335
00:19:37.959 --> 00:19:41.180
just to introduce himself.
but he was hardly lurking.

336
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.966
Well. Noah saw a guy run
around the side of the house.

337
00:19:45.096 --> 00:19:47.229
So we tried to catch him.

338
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.883
What? What happened?

339
00:19:49.013 --> 00:19:50.537
He got away.

340
00:19:51.277 --> 00:19:52.539
Okay.

341
00:19:53.801 --> 00:19:55.281
You don't believe me.

342
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:56.934
No. I didn't say that.

343
00:19:57.065 --> 00:19:59.198
I'm just wondering
if Noah saw something else

344
00:19:59.328 --> 00:20:00.851
and maybe thought
it was a person.

345
00:20:00.982 --> 00:20:02.375
He's on varsity tennis. Mom.

346
00:20:02.505 --> 00:20:04.246
I'd say his vision
is pretty good.

347
00:20:04.377 --> 00:20:07.902
It just seems odd that some guy
would be snooping around.

348
00:20:08.032 --> 00:20:09.295
Okay.

349
00:20:15.692 --> 00:20:17.651
Thanks so much
for coming back over.

350
00:20:17.781 --> 00:20:19.218
No problem.

351
00:20:22.264 --> 00:20:23.874
Now they can't get in.

352
00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:26.050
-So that's it?
-That's it.

353
00:20:26.181 --> 00:20:28.096
I. uh. laid the traps
and filled any holes

354
00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:29.706
they might use
to enter the house.

355
00:20:29.837 --> 00:20:31.099
So. you should be fine.

356
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.536
Oh. I was about to call
an exterminator.

357
00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:35.799
But then I thought. you know.
what if the noises I heard

358
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.888
wasn't animals
and it was just pipes clanking?

359
00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:39.412
Yeah. well. I'm glad you didn't.

360
00:20:39.542 --> 00:20:42.110
It doesn't look like
you have a pest problem to me.

361
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:44.591
But. uh. better safe
than sorry. right?

362
00:20:44.721 --> 00:20:46.723
Well. thank you
for dealing with it.

363
00:20:46.854 --> 00:20:47.898
You saved me some money. anyway.

364
00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:50.031
No. it was my pleasure. really.

365
00:20:50.161 --> 00:20:53.469
And Like I said.
I know this house.

366
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.558
Yeah. Great.

367
00:20:58.735 --> 00:21:01.347
Well. hey. looks like
you're really...

368
00:21:01.477 --> 00:21:02.609
getting settled in.

369
00:21:02.739 --> 00:21:04.785
Yeah. we're trying.

370
00:21:05.699 --> 00:21:06.656
Are you sure you don't want
some coffee?

371
00:21:06.787 --> 00:21:08.397
I was just about to make some.

372
00:21:08.528 --> 00:21:10.965
Oh. well. I wish I could.
but I really need to get going.

373
00:21:11.095 --> 00:21:13.359
Okay. Maybe some other time.

374
00:21:13.489 --> 00:21:15.709
Yeah. I'd like that.

375
00:21:15.839 --> 00:21:16.927
Okay.

376
00:23:17.091 --> 00:23:19.049
Thanks. So how'd you sleep?

377
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.661
- Fine. You?
- Good.

378
00:23:23.489 --> 00:23:25.926
Jordyn. I need to talk to you
about something.

379
00:23:26.056 --> 00:23:28.885
Mom. we had this talk
in middle school.

380
00:23:29.016 --> 00:23:31.540
Plus. they bring it up every
year in health class.

381
00:23:31.671 --> 00:23:36.458
No. not that. Um. did you move
the couch last night?

382
00:23:36.589 --> 00:23:39.940
-What?
-I want the truth.

383
00:23:41.071 --> 00:23:43.117
Mom. you asked Noah and I

384
00:23:43.247 --> 00:23:45.511
to move the couch
for you yesterday.

385
00:23:45.641 --> 00:23:47.077
Okay. but now it's back.

386
00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:49.079
So I thought maybe. you know.

387
00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:50.733
because you were irritated
with me

388
00:23:50.864 --> 00:23:52.039
for questioning whether or not

389
00:23:52.169 --> 00:23:54.171
you saw someone
outside the house.

390
00:23:54.302 --> 00:23:56.435
Um. I was irritated.

391
00:23:56.565 --> 00:23:58.088
So you moved the couch?

392
00:23:58.828 --> 00:24:00.221
Why would I do that?

393
00:24:00.351 --> 00:24:03.006
I don't know.
Maybe to make a statement?

394
00:24:03.877 --> 00:24:07.097
Here's a statement.
You're crazy.

395
00:24:14.322 --> 00:24:15.889
Give the kid a break.

396
00:24:16.019 --> 00:24:18.065
She's had to deal
with a lot in the last year.

397
00:24:18.195 --> 00:24:20.502
Count yourself lucky
she's still in school.

398
00:24:20.633 --> 00:24:23.984
I know. But I just don't
understand why she would do it.

399
00:24:24.114 --> 00:24:26.377
Maybe she's trying
to assert herself.

400
00:24:26.508 --> 00:24:28.597
make her presence felt
in the new house.

401
00:24:28.728 --> 00:24:30.164
Possibly.

402
00:24:30.294 --> 00:24:32.775
Just ignore it.
It'll stop eventually.

403
00:24:32.906 --> 00:24:34.342
Lucy. you should be a therapist.

404
00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:36.039
Hmm. Hardly.

405
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.128
Well. I don't know
what I would do without you.

406
00:24:40.957 --> 00:24:42.176
Oh.

407
00:24:46.093 --> 00:24:47.834
Hey. oh. sweetie. can you hand
me that one?

408
00:24:47.964 --> 00:24:49.444
-Uh. yeah.
-Just wanna make this place

409
00:24:49.575 --> 00:24:51.925
feel a little
bit more like ours. you know?

410
00:24:52.055 --> 00:24:53.927
- What is this?
- It's a shadow box.

411
00:24:54.057 --> 00:24:56.016
You know. with memorabilia
from the house.

412
00:24:56.146 --> 00:24:57.365
Huh.

413
00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:58.801
How do you feel
about Thai food tonight?

414
00:24:58.932 --> 00:25:01.064
Um. I'm going over to Noah's.

415
00:25:01.195 --> 00:25:03.197
Oh. Will his parents be there?

416
00:25:03.327 --> 00:25:04.372
Of course.

417
00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:06.417
Well. you do need
to eat. sweetie.

418
00:25:06.548 --> 00:25:07.897
They're gonna feed me.

419
00:25:08.028 --> 00:25:10.552
We just have
a big history test tomorrow.

420
00:25:10.683 --> 00:25:13.990
Oh. Are you guys...
you're dating now?

421
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:16.906
God. Mom. He's just a nice guy.

422
00:25:17.864 --> 00:25:19.605
All right. Just wake me up
when you get home.

423
00:25:19.735 --> 00:25:21.128
Okay.

424
00:25:41.191 --> 00:25:42.366
Oh.

425
00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:49.983
Oh.

426
00:25:53.769 --> 00:25:55.162
Hey. sweetie!

427
00:25:55.292 --> 00:25:56.206
Oh. God. Mom. You scared me.

428
00:25:56.337 --> 00:25:57.947
I thought you'd be asleep.

429
00:25:58.078 --> 00:26:00.820
No. I got a little preoccupied
unpacking boxes.

430
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.082
So how was studying?

431
00:26:02.212 --> 00:26:03.910
It's good.

432
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.042
Great. All right.
Well. goodnight.

433
00:26:06.782 --> 00:26:08.088
Love you. Sleep good.

434
00:26:08.218 --> 00:26:09.263
You. too.

435
00:26:54.874 --> 00:26:57.528
-Oh!
-Come on. you guys!

436
00:26:57.659 --> 00:26:59.182
You really scared me!

437
00:26:59.313 --> 00:27:01.402
Uh. I'm sorry. Mrs. Wilson.
I was just. um--

438
00:27:01.532 --> 00:27:04.927
Uh. I--I took his history book
by mistake.

439
00:27:05.841 --> 00:27:07.103
-Oh.
-Uh. here.

440
00:27:07.234 --> 00:27:09.802
Thank you! I should get going.

441
00:27:09.932 --> 00:27:12.935
Noah. Uh. let's just use
the front door. Always. please.

442
00:27:13.066 --> 00:27:14.197
- Of course.
- Please.

443
00:27:14.328 --> 00:27:15.503
Sorry.

444
00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:18.898
We didn't wanna wake you up.

445
00:27:19.028 --> 00:27:21.335
I'm sure you didn't.

446
00:27:22.902 --> 00:27:24.381
Don't give me that look. Mom.

447
00:27:24.512 --> 00:27:26.296
Jordyn. I'm not naive.

448
00:27:26.427 --> 00:27:28.037
Let's keep the windows closed

449
00:27:28.168 --> 00:27:30.649
and Noah out of the bedroom
from now on. okay?

450
00:27:31.301 --> 00:27:33.826
-Fine.
-Great.

451
00:27:37.481 --> 00:27:39.135
Goodnight.

452
00:28:27.836 --> 00:28:29.316
I don't want you to panic.

453
00:28:29.446 --> 00:28:31.274
but it sounds like
you have a poltergeist.

454
00:28:31.405 --> 00:28:33.146
Stop it.

455
00:28:33.276 --> 00:28:35.539
No. a ghost might be moving
things around in your house.

456
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:36.889
Okay. well. Lucy. you know that

457
00:28:37.019 --> 00:28:38.238
I don't believe
in that sort of thing.

458
00:28:38.368 --> 00:28:40.849
So there must be
some other explanation.

459
00:28:41.981 --> 00:28:44.331
Well. have you asked
Jordyn about it?

460
00:28:44.461 --> 00:28:47.160
I didn't want her to feel like
I was accusing her again.

461
00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.031
And I guess
I didn't wanna scare her.

462
00:28:49.162 --> 00:28:51.730
Yeah. Oh.

463
00:28:52.643 --> 00:28:53.906
I have a 10 o'clock meeting.

464
00:28:54.036 --> 00:28:56.212
-We'll talk later. okay?
-Yeah. Okay.

465
00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:06.135
Hey. Colin.

466
00:29:06.266 --> 00:29:07.702
Fine.

467
00:29:07.833 --> 00:29:09.878
Yeah. do you have
any free time today?

468
00:29:13.447 --> 00:29:15.275
So. do you think I'm crazy?

469
00:29:15.405 --> 00:29:16.537
Oh. yes.

470
00:29:16.667 --> 00:29:18.278
Certifiably so.

471
00:29:18.408 --> 00:29:19.714
I'm serious!

472
00:29:19.845 --> 00:29:21.847
No. I don't think you're crazy.

473
00:29:21.977 --> 00:29:24.284
And I'm--I'm really glad
you called.

474
00:29:25.111 --> 00:29:27.026
I just hoped. I don't know.

475
00:29:27.156 --> 00:29:29.593
maybe you might have
some sort of explanation

476
00:29:29.724 --> 00:29:31.334
for what's going on.

477
00:29:31.465 --> 00:29:32.858
I don't.

478
00:29:32.988 --> 00:29:34.729
And I'm finding it
a little hard to believe

479
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.035
what you're telling me.

480
00:29:36.165 --> 00:29:37.427
So nothing like that
ever happened

481
00:29:37.558 --> 00:29:39.778
-when you lived there?
-No.

482
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.128
Oh.

483
00:29:42.258 --> 00:29:45.435
Do you...
think it could be your daughter?

484
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.136
I did at first
when the couch was moved back.

485
00:29:50.266 --> 00:29:52.094
Hmm.

486
00:29:52.225 --> 00:29:53.792
She did have a history of lying
before we moved here.

487
00:29:53.922 --> 00:29:55.750
but she was with a friend
last night.

488
00:29:55.881 --> 00:29:57.839
Well. maybe she and her friend.

489
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:00.146
I have reason to believe
that they didn't.

490
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:04.324
Did you ask her what she thought
might've happened?

491
00:30:04.454 --> 00:30:07.457
I didn't wanna
scare her unnecessarily.

492
00:30:07.588 --> 00:30:09.764
Look. I would suggest
going to the police.

493
00:30:09.895 --> 00:30:13.550
But in this case. I'm not sure
how much they can really do.

494
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.337
I know what they'd do.
They'd think I was crazy.

495
00:30:19.643 --> 00:30:20.993
Why don't I take a look around?

496
00:30:21.123 --> 00:30:23.734
And see if anything strikes me
as suspicious.

497
00:30:23.865 --> 00:30:25.345
I'd appreciate that.

498
00:30:25.475 --> 00:30:27.608
Why don't you come over
for dinner tomorrow?

499
00:30:27.738 --> 00:30:28.870
Sure.

500
00:30:29.001 --> 00:30:30.176
Oh.

501
00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:31.699
-Ooh.
-Thank you.

502
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.048
Looks good.

503
00:30:33.179 --> 00:30:33.919
Can I get you guys
anything else?

504
00:30:34.049 --> 00:30:34.963
No. thank you.

505
00:30:35.094 --> 00:30:36.312
-Okay.
-All right. Yeah.

506
00:30:37.444 --> 00:30:38.575
Sorry. Every time I call.

507
00:30:38.706 --> 00:30:40.577
I'm either talking about me
or the house.

508
00:30:40.708 --> 00:30:43.798
Not at all. I gave you
my number for a reason.

509
00:30:43.929 --> 00:30:46.975
Okay. Colin Murray.
tell me more about.

510
00:30:47.106 --> 00:30:48.890
I don't know. the construction
that you do.

511
00:30:49.021 --> 00:30:52.024
Oh. it's mostly
residential renovations.

512
00:30:52.154 --> 00:30:54.113
Are you renovating
your place at all?

513
00:30:54.243 --> 00:30:56.376
A little. But I'm just
renting right now.

514
00:30:56.506 --> 00:30:58.769
You know. until I'm ready
to buy again.

515
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.380
Hmm. So are you married?

516
00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:02.730
No.

517
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:05.385
I haven't met
the right woman and...

518
00:31:06.429 --> 00:31:08.605
Oh. come on. tell me.

519
00:31:08.736 --> 00:31:10.216
Uh. I--I just...

520
00:31:10.346 --> 00:31:12.087
I always thought that
I'd get married

521
00:31:12.218 --> 00:31:14.785
and we'd live in the house.

522
00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:16.918
Raise a family there.

523
00:31:18.006 --> 00:31:18.964
Oh. Well. what about
your parents?

524
00:31:19.094 --> 00:31:21.183
They're both deceased.

525
00:31:21.923 --> 00:31:23.272
I'm so sorry.

526
00:31:23.403 --> 00:31:25.535
No. uh. they had me
when they were older

527
00:31:25.666 --> 00:31:27.842
and lived long and happy lives.

528
00:31:28.712 --> 00:31:31.498
Yeah. we had some good times
at that house.

529
00:31:31.628 --> 00:31:33.804
Well. I know Jordyn
and I will. too.

530
00:31:33.935 --> 00:31:35.545
It's a special place.

531
00:31:36.938 --> 00:31:40.550
Yeah. it really is.

532
00:31:42.639 --> 00:31:43.858
Lucy was right.

533
00:31:43.989 --> 00:31:45.642
-This place is pretty good.
-Uh-hmm.

534
00:31:48.297 --> 00:31:50.169
No phones
at the table. please.

535
00:31:50.299 --> 00:31:51.431
Sorry.

536
00:31:54.695 --> 00:31:56.218
It's your dad calling you.

537
00:31:56.349 --> 00:31:57.567
I know.

538
00:31:57.698 --> 00:31:59.308
Have you talked to him recently?

539
00:31:59.439 --> 00:32:00.570
No.

540
00:32:02.616 --> 00:32:04.226
Well. he's called you
three times tonight.

541
00:32:06.228 --> 00:32:07.229
I mean. if he's trying
to get in touch.

542
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.101
we should just talk about it.

543
00:32:09.231 --> 00:32:12.408
Mom. I haven't picked up.
Don't worry.

544
00:32:12.539 --> 00:32:14.062
Okay. Well. I'm--

545
00:32:14.193 --> 00:32:17.457
Um. I have an English paper
to finish. so...

546
00:32:17.587 --> 00:32:19.067
Okay. Sure.

547
00:32:43.831 --> 00:32:45.137
Ugh.

548
00:32:48.792 --> 00:32:50.142
Not again.

549
00:33:13.208 --> 00:33:14.470
Noah?

550
00:33:24.524 --> 00:33:25.873
Noah?

551
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:32.619
Frank?

552
00:33:33.489 --> 00:33:35.100
Hey. Sara.

553
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:36.971
What are you doing here?

554
00:33:37.102 --> 00:33:39.278
I was hoping to see
our daughter.

555
00:33:40.148 --> 00:33:41.541
In the middle of the night?

556
00:33:41.671 --> 00:33:44.109
I keep calling her. but...

557
00:33:44.239 --> 00:33:46.459
that girl. she. uh...

558
00:33:46.589 --> 00:33:48.330
she sure knows
how to hold a grudge.

559
00:33:48.461 --> 00:33:50.245
Wonder where she gets that from.

560
00:33:50.376 --> 00:33:51.638
If you wanna talk
to our daughter.

561
00:33:51.768 --> 00:33:53.814
you have to contact me
per our court order.

562
00:33:54.771 --> 00:33:58.123
And if I had.
you'd let me see her?

563
00:34:00.255 --> 00:34:02.301
If you do this again.
I'm gonna call the police.

564
00:34:02.431 --> 00:34:03.911
No need.

565
00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:05.391
I'm going.

566
00:34:11.223 --> 00:34:12.398
You're looking good. though.

567
00:34:12.527 --> 00:34:13.920
Oh.

568
00:34:14.922 --> 00:34:16.358
Who's Noah?

569
00:34:17.315 --> 00:34:19.360
Frank. get out of here.

570
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:22.234
Okay.

571
00:34:41.382 --> 00:34:42.949
When I asked
for something to drink.

572
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:45.170
I thought you'd bring me. like.
seltzer or something.

573
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.607
Oh! You deserve better
than bubbly water.

574
00:34:47.737 --> 00:34:49.043
- Uh-huh.
- Plus.

575
00:34:49.174 --> 00:34:50.871
your mom was.
like. "No alcohol."

576
00:34:51.001 --> 00:34:52.438
Except for this whiskey I found
in the back of a cupboard.

577
00:34:52.568 --> 00:34:55.179
Yeah.
she's not much of a drinker.

578
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.834
Anyways. let's toast?

579
00:34:57.965 --> 00:34:59.749
-To having an indoor pool.
-Yeah.

580
00:35:03.275 --> 00:35:05.581
-Oh!
-You don't like it?

581
00:35:05.712 --> 00:35:06.713
Um. not really.

582
00:35:06.843 --> 00:35:08.280
uh. but I need something

583
00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:10.630
-to help me get through tonight.
-What's tonight?

584
00:35:11.848 --> 00:35:13.111
My mom is having the guy

585
00:35:13.241 --> 00:35:15.243
who used to live here
over for dinner.

586
00:35:15.374 --> 00:35:17.593
Should be good and boring.

587
00:35:32.042 --> 00:35:33.522
I'm sorry I'm late. Lucy.

588
00:35:33.653 --> 00:35:34.610
Oh. my God.

589
00:35:34.741 --> 00:35:36.482
So. tell me everything.

590
00:35:36.612 --> 00:35:39.137
Did Frank really show up
last night?

591
00:35:39.267 --> 00:35:41.269
Tapping on Jordyn's window.

592
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.923
to wake her up
in the middle of the night.

593
00:35:43.053 --> 00:35:44.533
to talk to her.

594
00:35:45.708 --> 00:35:47.884
I mean. if he just wants
a relationship

595
00:35:48.015 --> 00:35:49.321
with Jordyn though.

596
00:35:49.451 --> 00:35:50.670
maybe that's a good thing.

597
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.889
Hmm. maybe.

598
00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.022
I just can't tell
if that's the only thing.

599
00:35:55.936 --> 00:35:58.112
Wait. do you think
he's been breaking in

600
00:35:58.243 --> 00:35:59.809
and doing those things?

601
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.071
It's entirely possible.

602
00:36:01.202 --> 00:36:03.422
Maybe he's desperate.

603
00:36:03.552 --> 00:36:04.901
Maybe.

604
00:36:05.032 --> 00:36:07.034
Oh. before I forget.

605
00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:10.472
I got an extra house key
made for you.

606
00:36:10.603 --> 00:36:13.127
Just in case I lock myself out.

607
00:36:13.258 --> 00:36:15.260
Or need me to swim in your pool.

608
00:36:16.913 --> 00:36:17.914
-Or that.
-Yeah.

609
00:36:18.045 --> 00:36:19.133
Anytime.

610
00:36:19.264 --> 00:36:20.482
I just need to make sure

611
00:36:20.613 --> 00:36:21.962
I'm back in time
for that dinner.

612
00:36:22.092 --> 00:36:23.224
Just a few more hours

613
00:36:23.355 --> 00:36:25.444
of studying at my place.
I promise.

614
00:36:25.574 --> 00:36:26.706
Yeah.

615
00:36:28.403 --> 00:36:29.709
Dad?

616
00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:31.624
Hey. kiddo.

617
00:36:31.754 --> 00:36:34.496
-Who's this?
-Uh. Noah Ryan. sir.

618
00:36:37.456 --> 00:36:39.284
You're not supposed to be here.

619
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:42.025
Look. you're my daughter.

620
00:36:42.156 --> 00:36:43.810
I have to see you.

621
00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.812
Well. you should have
thought of that before you left.

622
00:36:47.161 --> 00:36:47.901
Come on. sweetheart.

623
00:36:48.031 --> 00:36:49.729
I know you.

624
00:36:49.859 --> 00:36:52.993
Let's cut the angry
teenager routine.

625
00:36:53.123 --> 00:36:56.518
I have nothing to say to you.

626
00:36:56.649 --> 00:36:57.737
Let's go.

627
00:36:58.999 --> 00:37:00.479
Jordyn?

628
00:37:01.436 --> 00:37:02.655
Come on.

629
00:37:02.785 --> 00:37:03.960
Jordyn!

630
00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:23.893
I told you last night

631
00:37:24.024 --> 00:37:25.460
-to stay away.
-Yeah. I know.

632
00:37:25.591 --> 00:37:27.288
I just thought
I'd give it one last shot.

633
00:37:27.419 --> 00:37:29.551
-Are you stalking our house?
-What?

634
00:37:29.682 --> 00:37:33.251
No. I just--I just wanted an
opportunity to talk to Jordyn.

635
00:37:34.339 --> 00:37:36.123
Clearly. she doesn't want to.

636
00:37:37.733 --> 00:37:40.997
Okay. so you're not sneaking in
and moving things around on us?

637
00:37:41.128 --> 00:37:42.564
I'm trying to make contact.

638
00:37:42.695 --> 00:37:44.523
Not scare her.

639
00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:50.268
Why? Is something going on?
Is someone bothering you?

640
00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:53.575
No. no. we're fine. Never mind.

641
00:37:53.706 --> 00:37:55.229
Are you sure? You two are safe?

642
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.537
-We're fine.
-I could help.

643
00:37:58.667 --> 00:38:00.190
The best way you can help
right now. Frank.

644
00:38:00.321 --> 00:38:01.931
is by staying away.

645
00:38:06.936 --> 00:38:08.460
Fair enough.

646
00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:11.245
You know. it takes time
to earn trust back.

647
00:38:11.376 --> 00:38:12.681
So just give her some space.

648
00:38:12.812 --> 00:38:14.727
Fine.

649
00:38:14.857 --> 00:38:16.424
I'll keep my distance.

650
00:38:17.338 --> 00:38:18.948
Until she is ready.

651
00:38:36.401 --> 00:38:39.360
So. what. is this guy
like your boyfriend now?

652
00:38:39.491 --> 00:38:40.622
Boyfriend?

653
00:38:40.753 --> 00:38:42.320
Please. He's just a nice guy.

654
00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:43.582
You know. like Noah.

655
00:38:45.279 --> 00:38:46.324
Oh!

656
00:38:49.631 --> 00:38:50.850
- Hi.
- Hi.

657
00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.112
I hope I'm not late.

658
00:38:52.242 --> 00:38:54.332
Not at all. Come on in.

659
00:38:56.986 --> 00:38:58.814
I know you said
not to bring anything.

660
00:38:58.945 --> 00:39:00.729
but I couldn't come
empty-handed.

661
00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.905
God forbid.

662
00:39:03.036 --> 00:39:04.733
Thank you.

663
00:39:04.864 --> 00:39:06.518
Colin. this is my daughter.
Jordyn.

664
00:39:06.648 --> 00:39:08.520
Hi. Jordyn.
And pleased to meet you.

665
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:09.651
I've heard a lot about you.

666
00:39:09.782 --> 00:39:11.784
Oh. great.

667
00:39:11.914 --> 00:39:13.351
Come on. Have a seat.

668
00:39:14.613 --> 00:39:16.354
Well. she's looking good.

669
00:39:19.922 --> 00:39:21.359
Oh. yeah. the house.

670
00:39:21.489 --> 00:39:23.665
Oh. yes. the house.

671
00:39:25.145 --> 00:39:29.454
Anyway. so. uh. Jordyn.
how do you like your new school?

672
00:39:29.584 --> 00:39:31.586
Um. same as my last one.

673
00:39:31.717 --> 00:39:33.458
I don't.

674
00:39:33.588 --> 00:39:34.633
Can I get you some wine?

675
00:39:34.763 --> 00:39:36.069
Please.

676
00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:39.464
Jordyn. what do you make
of the latest

677
00:39:39.594 --> 00:39:40.987
occurrence in the house?

678
00:39:43.424 --> 00:39:44.817
What occurrence?

679
00:39:44.947 --> 00:39:47.036
I haven't had a chance
to talk to her about that yet.

680
00:39:47.167 --> 00:39:49.561
Oh. gosh. I'm so sorry.

681
00:39:50.736 --> 00:39:53.478
Oh. it's just that some things
we moved again.

682
00:39:54.653 --> 00:39:56.481
And you think I did it?

683
00:39:56.611 --> 00:39:59.179
Did you...do it?

684
00:40:00.136 --> 00:40:02.182
-Oh!
-Oh. I'm sorry. I overstepped.

685
00:40:02.312 --> 00:40:04.053
It's just that
your mother and I. we were--

686
00:40:04.184 --> 00:40:07.143
We were just looking
for a rational explanation.

687
00:40:07.274 --> 00:40:08.188
For what?

688
00:40:08.318 --> 00:40:09.668
Uh. the fact that the shadow box

689
00:40:09.798 --> 00:40:11.670
is hanging up again
after I took it down

690
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.106
a few nights ago.

691
00:40:13.236 --> 00:40:15.325
Oh. well. well. busted!
You got me!

692
00:40:15.456 --> 00:40:17.197
Yeah. yeah. yeah.
I really just don't like seeing

693
00:40:17.327 --> 00:40:20.113
shadow boxes mistreated.

694
00:40:22.115 --> 00:40:24.334
Ridiculous.

695
00:40:24.465 --> 00:40:26.032
Wow. I apologize.

696
00:40:26.162 --> 00:40:27.250
I didn't mean to--

697
00:40:27.381 --> 00:40:29.078
She's just an angry teenager

698
00:40:29.209 --> 00:40:30.428
who's been through a lot.

699
00:40:31.516 --> 00:40:34.562
You know. my husband...
my ex-husband.

700
00:40:34.693 --> 00:40:35.781
he was pretty rough.

701
00:40:35.911 --> 00:40:37.173
I mean. not. uh. physically.

702
00:40:37.304 --> 00:40:39.437
but just not the nicest of guys.

703
00:40:39.567 --> 00:40:42.396
He used to put us
both down a lot.

704
00:40:42.527 --> 00:40:46.400
And then. one day. he just left.

705
00:40:47.314 --> 00:40:49.272
That's terrible. I'm sorry.

706
00:40:49.403 --> 00:40:50.448
You know.
he came by this morning.

707
00:40:50.578 --> 00:40:53.668
so I know that's why
she's upset.

708
00:40:53.799 --> 00:40:55.365
Makes sense.

709
00:40:55.496 --> 00:40:57.324
You would think
that this whole situation

710
00:40:57.455 --> 00:40:59.848
would bring us closer together.
but...

711
00:40:59.979 --> 00:41:02.242
-Have you ever thought--
-A therapy?

712
00:41:02.372 --> 00:41:03.635
Uh. yeah. we've had therapy.

713
00:41:03.765 --> 00:41:06.246
No. No.
Have you ever thought that...

714
00:41:06.376 --> 00:41:10.032
well. you know.
maybe it's your ex-husband

715
00:41:10.163 --> 00:41:11.947
doing these things?

716
00:41:12.078 --> 00:41:16.648
Yeah. I did. but not anymore.

717
00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:19.302
Mom. where are the paper towels?

718
00:41:19.433 --> 00:41:21.348
What happened? Something spill?

719
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:24.264
Um. yeah.
just my entire plate of pasta.

720
00:41:24.394 --> 00:41:25.874
Okay. Let me grab a towel.

721
00:41:26.005 --> 00:41:27.441
Hang tight.

722
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:30.313
Hey. Jordyn. uh.

723
00:41:30.444 --> 00:41:32.185
why don't you sit for a sec?

724
00:41:33.708 --> 00:41:35.014
Why?

725
00:41:35.144 --> 00:41:36.145
Oh. just hoping
maybe we could have

726
00:41:36.276 --> 00:41:38.800
a moment together to connect.

727
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:41.411
Okay. Um. let me guess.

728
00:41:41.542 --> 00:41:44.197
you're gonna tell me
how much my mom means to you.

729
00:41:44.327 --> 00:41:46.678
and how you understand
that it's hard for me

730
00:41:46.808 --> 00:41:48.767
to see her with another man.

731
00:41:48.897 --> 00:41:50.377
Oh. wait! No. no. no. no.

732
00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:54.860
It's totally that you know
how much I mean to my mom.

733
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:58.080
and how I now mean a lot to you.

734
00:41:58.211 --> 00:42:00.126
Am I getting close?

735
00:42:00.256 --> 00:42:03.259
Actually. I was gonna tell you
to stop being so ungrateful

736
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.045
that you get to live
in this house.

737
00:42:09.918 --> 00:42:12.704
Okay. well. your. uh. comforter
is in the wash.

738
00:42:12.834 --> 00:42:15.750
Just make yourself
another plate. okay?

739
00:42:15.881 --> 00:42:17.404
I'm good.

740
00:42:19.754 --> 00:42:21.060
Uh-hmm.

741
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:22.452
Oh. sorry about that.

742
00:42:22.583 --> 00:42:23.845
Where were we?

743
00:42:23.976 --> 00:42:24.803
You want some salad?

744
00:42:24.933 --> 00:42:26.326
Sure.

745
00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.242
Looks good.

746
00:42:32.898 --> 00:42:35.553
Thank you for
such a lovely dinner tonight.

747
00:42:35.683 --> 00:42:38.425
Oh. thank you for checking out
the house for me.

748
00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:40.383
Yeah. the doors
and locks are secure.

749
00:42:40.514 --> 00:42:41.994
No one's getting in here.

750
00:42:42.124 --> 00:42:43.125
Thank you.

751
00:42:43.256 --> 00:42:45.258
Oh. hang on! Hey!

752
00:42:48.783 --> 00:42:52.091
-What's this?
-It's just a small thank you.

753
00:42:54.136 --> 00:42:55.877
This is the. uh.
Prohibition Amendment.

754
00:42:56.008 --> 00:42:57.313
written on the side there.

755
00:42:57.444 --> 00:42:58.576
I saw it at this little shop.

756
00:42:58.706 --> 00:43:00.142
and it just made me
think of you.

757
00:43:00.273 --> 00:43:02.449
because of the house's history.

758
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:04.930
Wow.

759
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.148
Thank you.

760
00:43:06.279 --> 00:43:07.889
It's my pleasure.

761
00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.675
And I'm so sorry
about Jordyn's behavior tonight.

762
00:43:10.805 --> 00:43:13.939
Oh. well. we were all
teenagers once. right?

763
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:15.767
Yes. That. we were.

764
00:43:18.465 --> 00:43:20.641
It's not just that
he's on her side. Noah.

765
00:43:20.772 --> 00:43:22.774
I am telling you
there is something

766
00:43:22.904 --> 00:43:25.385
really off about this guy.

767
00:43:25.515 --> 00:43:26.516
How so?

768
00:43:26.647 --> 00:43:28.170
I feel like he's using her

769
00:43:28.301 --> 00:43:30.825
to get his house back
or something.

770
00:43:30.956 --> 00:43:32.610
Or maybe he just likes her.

771
00:43:33.698 --> 00:43:35.177
Oh. my God. Ugh!

772
00:43:35.308 --> 00:43:37.266
I'm watching them
talk outside right now.

773
00:43:37.397 --> 00:43:38.964
I bet she wants him to kiss her.

774
00:43:40.226 --> 00:43:41.662
It's pathetic.

775
00:43:41.793 --> 00:43:43.316
-Ew.
-Oh.

776
00:43:44.491 --> 00:43:45.710
Uh. my mom's calling.

777
00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.885
I got to go. okay?

778
00:43:47.015 --> 00:43:48.190
Okay.

779
00:43:48.321 --> 00:43:49.496
See you tomorrow.

780
00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.631
We should do this again.

781
00:43:53.761 --> 00:43:55.545
Yeah. I mean. I would love to
have you over at my place.

782
00:43:55.676 --> 00:43:58.200
but. uh. not really nice enough
for entertaining.

783
00:43:58.331 --> 00:43:59.637
Oh. that's okay.

784
00:43:59.767 --> 00:44:00.986
I mean. really.
I just wanted to say

785
00:44:01.116 --> 00:44:02.683
thank you for the advice and...

786
00:44:02.814 --> 00:44:05.077
But I would love to take you out
to a restaurant sometime.

787
00:44:05.207 --> 00:44:07.427
I mean. if you'd like.

788
00:44:07.557 --> 00:44:10.691
Yeah. I'd like that very much.

789
00:44:10.822 --> 00:44:11.823
Okay.

790
00:44:13.041 --> 00:44:16.044
Well. good night.

791
00:44:16.175 --> 00:44:17.959
Good night.

792
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:19.657
-Bye.
-Bye.

793
00:46:40.536 --> 00:46:41.755
Good morning.

794
00:46:43.104 --> 00:46:44.497
I said good morning.

795
00:46:45.846 --> 00:46:48.327
Do you wanna at least talk
about last night?

796
00:46:49.545 --> 00:46:52.331
-No.
-Jordyn. please.

797
00:46:53.245 --> 00:46:54.899
Mom. your creepy new boyfriend

798
00:46:55.029 --> 00:46:56.944
called me ungrateful

799
00:46:57.075 --> 00:46:59.555
because I am not thrilled
about living in this house.

800
00:46:59.686 --> 00:47:02.123
Well. I...I'm sure
he didn't call you ungrateful.

801
00:47:02.254 --> 00:47:05.735
He was probably just urging you
to appreciate living here.

802
00:47:05.866 --> 00:47:08.738
No. Mom. he did.

803
00:47:08.869 --> 00:47:11.524
and he was weird
and mean about it.

804
00:47:13.091 --> 00:47:14.614
Can you not do this?

805
00:47:14.744 --> 00:47:17.008
I mean. I really want us
to have a new start.

806
00:47:17.138 --> 00:47:20.098
A new start would be you
starting to trust me.

807
00:47:20.228 --> 00:47:23.188
Okay. you lied to me
about drinking and vaping.

808
00:47:23.318 --> 00:47:25.103
Oh. my God.
that was just a phase.

809
00:47:25.233 --> 00:47:26.669
And I'm over it.

810
00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.411
Well. it takes a minute
to earn trust back. okay?

811
00:47:29.542 --> 00:47:31.849
Even the people
you love the most.

812
00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.853
Oh. and take Noah's camera
back to him.

813
00:47:35.983 --> 00:47:37.202
That's not Noah's.

814
00:47:38.246 --> 00:47:40.640
-Whose is it?
-I don't know. Colin's?

815
00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:42.033
Uh. that's not Colin's.

816
00:47:42.163 --> 00:47:43.643
He didn't bring that
over last night.

817
00:47:43.773 --> 00:47:46.733
God! I hate this house.

818
00:48:24.858 --> 00:48:26.904
So. it doesn't actually work?

819
00:48:27.034 --> 00:48:30.951
Uh. no. These cables.
they weren't even plugged in.

820
00:48:32.083 --> 00:48:35.216
so I don't think that camera
can record anything.

821
00:48:36.217 --> 00:48:37.566
You know.
I remember admiring this tree

822
00:48:37.697 --> 00:48:39.525
when I bought the house.

823
00:48:39.655 --> 00:48:41.353
I feel like I would've
noticed that.

824
00:48:41.483 --> 00:48:43.964
And you didn't install anything
when you lived here?

825
00:48:44.095 --> 00:48:45.705
Uh. no.

826
00:48:45.835 --> 00:48:47.489
I didn't install any
security cameras around here.

827
00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.448
I never felt like
I needed them. so.

828
00:48:49.578 --> 00:48:51.841
What do you think
it's doing up there?

829
00:48:51.972 --> 00:48:55.628
Well. maybe the bank thought
they should have one.

830
00:48:55.758 --> 00:48:57.108
when they were
showing the place.

831
00:48:57.238 --> 00:49:00.154
and then. you know.
just forgot to remove it.

832
00:49:00.285 --> 00:49:02.200
Okay. So no one's watching me?

833
00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:03.679
Watching you?

834
00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:04.898
Uh. no.

835
00:49:05.029 --> 00:49:07.074
That camera
looks pretty inactive.

836
00:49:07.205 --> 00:49:08.510
Oh. I...I'm sorry.

837
00:49:08.641 --> 00:49:10.164
You must think
I'm out of my mind.

838
00:49:10.295 --> 00:49:11.861
Not at all.

839
00:49:11.992 --> 00:49:13.037
I think you're just getting
used to a new house

840
00:49:13.167 --> 00:49:14.473
and all its quirks.

841
00:49:14.603 --> 00:49:16.170
I hope I didn't
mess up your morning

842
00:49:16.301 --> 00:49:18.694
by calling you here.
for basically nothing.

843
00:49:18.825 --> 00:49:22.089
It's no problem. Really.
I'm happy to help.

844
00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:24.874
And. I was close by. so...

845
00:49:25.005 --> 00:49:26.659
Okay.

846
00:49:28.661 --> 00:49:31.098
So are you becoming a thing?

847
00:49:31.229 --> 00:49:33.231
Yeah. I like him.

848
00:49:33.361 --> 00:49:35.276
Like him. like him?

849
00:49:35.407 --> 00:49:37.104
What are we. in junior high?

850
00:49:38.323 --> 00:49:40.934
To be honest.
it's just nice to have someone.

851
00:49:41.065 --> 00:49:42.283
Of course it is.

852
00:49:42.414 --> 00:49:44.155
And not just for companionship.

853
00:49:45.634 --> 00:49:47.158
because of the house.

854
00:49:47.288 --> 00:49:48.986
It's still freaking you out?

855
00:49:50.465 --> 00:49:52.554
I feel like someone
is inside the house watching me.

856
00:49:52.685 --> 00:49:54.078
I found a camera this morning

857
00:49:54.208 --> 00:49:56.123
that neither Jordyn nor I
have ever seen.

858
00:49:56.254 --> 00:49:58.560
It doesn't make any sense.

859
00:49:58.691 --> 00:50:01.041
I need to come over
and burn some sage.

860
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:05.828
-That's not necessary. Lucy.
-No. it wouldn't hurt.

861
00:50:05.959 --> 00:50:08.048
Jordyn told me this morning
that she hates the house.

862
00:50:08.179 --> 00:50:09.963
She wished
we'd never moved there.

863
00:50:10.094 --> 00:50:12.748
She's just angry.

864
00:50:12.879 --> 00:50:14.837
Maybe.

865
00:50:14.968 --> 00:50:16.187
Oh.

866
00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:24.195
-Oh!
-What you need is proof.

867
00:50:24.325 --> 00:50:27.894
Of what? That there's something
messed up about this house?

868
00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:29.069
Sure.

869
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.549
It's just.

870
00:50:30.679 --> 00:50:33.247
now that she's dating Colin.

871
00:50:33.378 --> 00:50:36.555
ugh. and he's. like.
in love with this place.

872
00:50:36.685 --> 00:50:39.645
so she feels
like she needs to be too.

873
00:50:39.775 --> 00:50:43.257
I just...I wanted to see
how twisted he is.

874
00:50:43.388 --> 00:50:44.867
Yeah.

875
00:50:46.173 --> 00:50:51.526
Hey. we should find out
where he lives and follow him.

876
00:50:51.657 --> 00:50:53.789
-Why?
-Because I bet he does

877
00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.141
something creepy and we can
use it against him.

878
00:50:57.271 --> 00:50:58.838
Come on.

879
00:50:58.968 --> 00:51:00.492
Isn't your mom
gonna be home soon?

880
00:51:00.622 --> 00:51:02.581
Nope. We have time.

881
00:51:04.974 --> 00:51:06.933
There's nothing on this guy.

882
00:51:08.195 --> 00:51:10.589
There's a racecar driver
with the same name.

883
00:51:11.633 --> 00:51:12.808
Hey. click on that site.

884
00:51:12.939 --> 00:51:14.332
No. you have to pay
for that one.

885
00:51:14.462 --> 00:51:16.334
I'll pay for it.

886
00:51:16.464 --> 00:51:17.770
Okay.

887
00:51:18.684 --> 00:51:19.989
Here's my card.

888
00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.252
And we don't have
a lot of homework.

889
00:51:21.382 --> 00:51:22.688
so we can go
check out his place later.

890
00:51:22.818 --> 00:51:24.516
Yeah. good idea.

891
00:51:24.646 --> 00:51:26.170
Great.

892
00:51:30.739 --> 00:51:32.480
Okay. Here we go.

893
00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:35.701
Just type in his name and...

894
00:51:37.181 --> 00:51:38.704
check this out.

895
00:51:38.834 --> 00:51:40.662
That's my address.

896
00:51:51.282 --> 00:51:53.588
Maybe it's just not
the right house for us.

897
00:51:53.719 --> 00:51:55.068
I mean. it's so lovely

898
00:51:55.199 --> 00:51:56.243
and it has everything
we could want but--

899
00:51:56.374 --> 00:51:58.550
Yeah. houses are like people.

900
00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.509
You click with some
and not with others.

901
00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.295
and sometimes for no
discernable reason.

902
00:52:05.165 --> 00:52:06.514
I gotta be honest.

903
00:52:06.645 --> 00:52:09.126
there's been some
strange things happening.

904
00:52:10.866 --> 00:52:12.303
What kind of strange things?

905
00:52:12.433 --> 00:52:15.871
Things being moved
like furniture

906
00:52:16.002 --> 00:52:18.178
and I've heard noises. I...

907
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:21.312
Like you think
the house is haunted?

908
00:52:23.357 --> 00:52:25.794
I usually don't believe
in things like that.

909
00:52:25.925 --> 00:52:27.666
But I don't know what to think.

910
00:52:27.796 --> 00:52:30.016
I mean.
there's no good explanation.

911
00:52:30.147 --> 00:52:33.585
Well. your house
should be a place

912
00:52:33.715 --> 00:52:35.848
where you can relax

913
00:52:35.978 --> 00:52:39.068
and--and you're able
to be yourself.

914
00:52:39.199 --> 00:52:40.418
Exactly.

915
00:52:40.548 --> 00:52:42.681
I feel like that's
what we're missing.

916
00:52:42.811 --> 00:52:45.249
Yeah. I know.

917
00:52:45.379 --> 00:52:47.120
I've sold enough houses
to enough people

918
00:52:47.251 --> 00:52:49.035
to know that a home

919
00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:51.690
is a place you need
to feel safe.

920
00:52:52.778 --> 00:52:54.823
You and Jordyn.
you deserve a place

921
00:52:54.954 --> 00:52:56.608
that you can feel comfortable.

922
00:52:56.738 --> 00:52:58.610
Yeah.

923
00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.699
You know.
if you're interested in selling.

924
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:03.397
I could find plenty of buyers.

925
00:53:03.528 --> 00:53:04.442
Really?

926
00:53:04.572 --> 00:53:05.921
Oh. for sure.

927
00:53:06.052 --> 00:53:08.663
It's a historic home
with an indoor pool.

928
00:53:08.794 --> 00:53:11.057
Now. you will lose equity

929
00:53:11.188 --> 00:53:13.451
but you should get
your money back.

930
00:53:13.581 --> 00:53:15.061
It could be worth it.

931
00:53:16.062 --> 00:53:19.239
Okay. Okay.

932
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:20.675
Great.

933
00:53:20.806 --> 00:53:22.677
Well. I'll go ahead
and send you some links

934
00:53:22.808 --> 00:53:25.550
to some properties in the area
you might be interested in.

935
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:29.815
Thank you. Kendall.
Gosh. I really appreciate that.

936
00:53:29.945 --> 00:53:31.643
It's my pleasure.

937
00:53:47.398 --> 00:53:49.661
Hey. Mom?

938
00:53:49.791 --> 00:53:51.315
Yeah.

939
00:53:53.012 --> 00:53:54.405
Uh. Noah is picking me up.

940
00:53:54.535 --> 00:53:56.363
We're going to the varsity
basketball game.

941
00:53:56.494 --> 00:53:58.191
Great. Is your homework done?

942
00:53:58.322 --> 00:54:00.324
Uh. I won't be late.

943
00:54:00.454 --> 00:54:01.716
Okay.

944
00:54:02.717 --> 00:54:08.332
Mom. um. how much do you know
about that Colin guy?

945
00:54:09.246 --> 00:54:10.508
I mean. plenty. you know.

946
00:54:10.638 --> 00:54:12.423
for getting to know someone
at this stage.

947
00:54:12.553 --> 00:54:16.165
But you've never been
to his place?

948
00:54:16.296 --> 00:54:18.429
Yeah. I--I think
he's embarrassed by it.

949
00:54:22.563 --> 00:54:26.524
Um. well. I looked him up
online today

950
00:54:26.654 --> 00:54:31.485
and this address was listed
for where he lives.

951
00:54:31.616 --> 00:54:33.748
You can't totally trust
an internet search.

952
00:54:33.879 --> 00:54:37.926
Yeah. but I went to. like.
a legit fancy site

953
00:54:38.057 --> 00:54:39.928
that you have to pay for.

954
00:54:40.059 --> 00:54:41.452
Well. he used to live here.

955
00:54:41.582 --> 00:54:42.670
so maybe they haven't updated
the records yet.

956
00:54:42.801 --> 00:54:45.194
No. because we were listed
as living here

957
00:54:45.325 --> 00:54:47.936
and we just moved in.

958
00:54:48.067 --> 00:54:50.765
Hmm. that's a little strange.

959
00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:55.596
What if he lives in his car?

960
00:54:55.727 --> 00:54:59.470
And the reason why
he's always here is because...

961
00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:02.081
he doesn't have a place to live?

962
00:55:02.211 --> 00:55:04.692
I don't get that impression

963
00:55:04.823 --> 00:55:07.739
but you're right.
I am still getting to know him.

964
00:55:07.869 --> 00:55:10.785
Just be careful.

965
00:55:10.916 --> 00:55:13.353
I know you're being protective
for me. sweetie.

966
00:55:13.484 --> 00:55:15.573
And I really appreciate it.

967
00:55:15.703 --> 00:55:17.444
Okay. but I also know

968
00:55:17.575 --> 00:55:19.968
that he's the first guy
that I've seen since your dad.

969
00:55:20.099 --> 00:55:22.580
-Probably--
-Never mind.

970
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:24.451
Listen. go have fun tonight.
okay?

971
00:55:24.582 --> 00:55:25.974
Enjoy the game.

972
00:55:26.105 --> 00:55:27.889
I'm gonna go to bed soon anyway.
Do you have your key?

973
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.630
Yeah.

974
00:55:29.761 --> 00:55:31.676
Okay. Have fun.

975
00:55:33.025 --> 00:55:34.243
Love you.

976
00:56:51.016 --> 00:56:53.845
There was a loose wire
to the breaker box.

977
00:56:53.975 --> 00:56:55.455
It happens.

978
00:56:55.586 --> 00:56:58.284
The whole thing
is really disconcerting.

979
00:56:58.415 --> 00:57:00.808
I think maybe I should
call the cops.

980
00:57:00.939 --> 00:57:04.072
I agree. the picture is weird
and disturbing

981
00:57:04.203 --> 00:57:07.511
but it's not really a crime.

982
00:57:08.903 --> 00:57:10.862
I'm still shaking.
Jordyn's gonna be home soon.

983
00:57:10.992 --> 00:57:12.603
I don't want her
to see me like this.

984
00:57:12.733 --> 00:57:14.692
Let me go see
if I can find something

985
00:57:14.822 --> 00:57:16.258
to calm your nerves.

986
00:57:28.314 --> 00:57:29.533
You're still up?

987
00:57:29.663 --> 00:57:31.535
Uh-huh. Yeah.

988
00:57:33.014 --> 00:57:37.062
Well. the pantry cabinet
definitely needs some WD40.

989
00:57:37.192 --> 00:57:39.499
Oh. Hi. Jordyn.

990
00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:41.675
Hi.

991
00:57:41.806 --> 00:57:43.068
Thank you.

992
00:57:43.198 --> 00:57:45.244
Mom. is everything okay?

993
00:57:45.374 --> 00:57:47.594
Yeah. I just had a little scare.

994
00:57:47.725 --> 00:57:49.466
Well. what was it?

995
00:57:50.815 --> 00:57:53.644
Um. there was a painting left
at the front door.

996
00:58:00.825 --> 00:58:02.827
Oh. my God!

997
00:58:02.957 --> 00:58:04.568
That is so messed up!

998
00:58:04.698 --> 00:58:06.831
Jordyn. I don't want us
to overreact.

999
00:58:06.961 --> 00:58:08.397
Overreact?

1000
00:58:08.528 --> 00:58:09.834
You're drinking whiskey
which you never do

1001
00:58:09.964 --> 00:58:12.053
because you know
something is wrong. Mom.

1002
00:58:12.184 --> 00:58:14.012
Jordyn. I think what your mother
is trying to say

1003
00:58:14.142 --> 00:58:16.754
is that there has to be
a rational explanation for this.

1004
00:58:16.884 --> 00:58:18.016
Why are you always here?

1005
00:58:18.146 --> 00:58:19.844
You know.
it's not your house anymore.

1006
00:58:19.974 --> 00:58:21.759
Jordyn.

1007
00:58:21.889 --> 00:58:23.151
Stop it.

1008
00:58:23.282 --> 00:58:26.372
Of course. Take his side.

1009
00:58:28.809 --> 00:58:31.856
I should let you two
work this out.

1010
00:58:31.986 --> 00:58:33.858
I'm so sorry
she spoke to you like that.

1011
00:58:33.988 --> 00:58:35.686
It's okay.

1012
00:58:35.816 --> 00:58:38.123
And thank you
for coming over tonight.

1013
00:58:38.253 --> 00:58:39.646
I'll check on you tomorrow.

1014
00:58:39.777 --> 00:58:41.300
Okay.

1015
00:58:52.572 --> 00:58:54.966
Hey. I couldn't sleep.

1016
00:58:55.096 --> 00:58:56.533
Mind if I join you?

1017
00:59:01.886 --> 00:59:06.543
I know that painting
is really disturbing

1018
00:59:06.673 --> 00:59:08.936
and I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it.

1019
00:59:09.067 --> 00:59:10.764
And sweetie.
I wasn't taking his side.

1020
00:59:10.895 --> 00:59:13.811
I just...
I don't want you to be rude.

1021
00:59:13.941 --> 00:59:16.291
Can we agree that
his obsession with the house

1022
00:59:16.422 --> 00:59:19.381
is a little strange?

1023
00:59:19.512 --> 00:59:21.862
Well. he really loves it.

1024
00:59:21.993 --> 00:59:24.691
And I think it's because
his parents have died

1025
00:59:24.822 --> 00:59:27.738
and doesn't have any family.

1026
00:59:27.868 --> 00:59:31.350
so in some ways.
this house is all he has left.

1027
00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.613
But it's like he has no life.

1028
00:59:33.744 --> 00:59:37.748
He's just always available
to stop by.

1029
00:59:37.878 --> 00:59:41.055
You know.
he's been very helpful.

1030
00:59:41.186 --> 00:59:43.014
I just don't trust him.

1031
00:59:44.058 --> 00:59:45.451
Okay.

1032
00:59:45.582 --> 00:59:47.018
Well. I do.

1033
00:59:47.148 --> 00:59:49.586
He's been a really
good friend to me.

1034
00:59:50.935 --> 00:59:52.719
I tell you
how I feel and it's...

1035
00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:54.895
you just...
it feels like you don't care.

1036
00:59:55.026 --> 00:59:56.767
Of course I care.

1037
00:59:56.897 --> 00:59:59.334
I'm just saying
that I don't feel the same.

1038
00:59:59.465 --> 01:00:02.773
You're just so quick
to dismiss my opinions. Mom.

1039
01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:05.340
It's like you've stopped
believing in anything I've said.

1040
01:00:05.471 --> 01:00:07.778
That is just not true.

1041
01:00:11.956 --> 01:00:13.305
We can't catch a break.

1042
01:00:13.435 --> 01:00:17.701
Wow. This is...disturbing.

1043
01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.094
Who would've done it?

1044
01:00:20.225 --> 01:00:22.053
I have no idea.

1045
01:00:22.183 --> 01:00:23.881
And Jordyn's right.

1046
01:00:24.011 --> 01:00:26.579
There's something wrong
about this house.

1047
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.450
I just had such high hopes.

1048
01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:30.235
Of course you did.

1049
01:00:30.365 --> 01:00:32.585
I mean. we have to be
comfortable in our own home.

1050
01:00:32.716 --> 01:00:34.543
Exactly.

1051
01:00:34.674 --> 01:00:35.849
I just wish there was a way

1052
01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.068
we could resolve
whatever it is going on

1053
01:00:37.198 --> 01:00:38.678
without having to leave.

1054
01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:41.986
You're dreading
what Colin would say

1055
01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:45.119
if you told him you're thinking
of selling. aren't you?

1056
01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:48.253
I'm just
afraid he'd be disappointed.

1057
01:00:48.383 --> 01:00:51.952
I mean. I know
that's crazy for me to say but--

1058
01:00:52.083 --> 01:00:54.259
No. no. you--you like the guy.

1059
01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:56.174
Yeah.

1060
01:00:56.304 --> 01:00:58.132
I guess I do.

1061
01:00:58.263 --> 01:01:01.570
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

1062
01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:03.442
You're the best. Lucy.
Thank you.

1063
01:01:03.572 --> 01:01:04.399
Goodnight.

1064
01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:05.923
Yeah. Goodnight.

1065
01:01:07.968 --> 01:01:09.143
Hmm.

1066
01:01:15.584 --> 01:01:18.326
I love the windows in this room.

1067
01:01:18.457 --> 01:01:20.241
Oh. it's a great room. isn't it?

1068
01:01:20.372 --> 01:01:22.591
Yeah. Oh. thanks.

1069
01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:24.376
Be careful. They're hot.

1070
01:01:24.506 --> 01:01:25.943
Oh.

1071
01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:33.777
So. an out-of-town buyer
has made an offer.

1072
01:01:33.907 --> 01:01:35.300
Huh.

1073
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:39.391
Twenty percent more than
what you paid for this place.

1074
01:01:39.521 --> 01:01:42.133
Wow.

1075
01:01:42.263 --> 01:01:44.178
Wow. Why so much?

1076
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:47.007
Um. I don't know.

1077
01:01:47.138 --> 01:01:49.009
I think he needs the indoor pool

1078
01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.011
for physical therapy
or something.

1079
01:01:51.142 --> 01:01:54.058
But who cares?

1080
01:01:54.188 --> 01:01:55.886
He made the offer.

1081
01:01:58.584 --> 01:02:03.632
Sara. this is a no-brainer.

1082
01:02:03.763 --> 01:02:05.504
Why aren't you jumping up
and down?

1083
01:02:05.634 --> 01:02:09.726
I just didn't expect something
to happen so fast I guess.

1084
01:02:11.336 --> 01:02:13.642
That's the way
the real estate market works.

1085
01:02:13.773 --> 01:02:16.036
It's feast or famine.

1086
01:02:16.167 --> 01:02:17.908
I think you need
to jump on this.

1087
01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:21.128
Yeah. I know.
It's a great offer.

1088
01:02:21.259 --> 01:02:24.828
Just give me a day or two
to think about it.

1089
01:02:24.958 --> 01:02:27.352
Of course. No problem.

1090
01:02:30.572 --> 01:02:31.660
Hmm.

1091
01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:46.850
Hi. You've reached
Sara Wilson's cell phone.

1092
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.286
Please leave a message

1093
01:02:48.416 --> 01:02:50.027
and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.

1094
01:02:50.157 --> 01:02:51.419
Hey. Sara.

1095
01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:52.594
Look. I just decided
to come into the office

1096
01:02:52.725 --> 01:02:54.205
to finish that report

1097
01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:56.555
and I started doing research
on your house

1098
01:02:56.685 --> 01:02:58.557
just to see if there was any way
to solve its mystery

1099
01:02:58.687 --> 01:03:03.431
and well I uncovered something
really interesting.

1100
01:03:03.562 --> 01:03:05.825
Look. I'm gonna come over
to tell you in person.

1101
01:03:05.956 --> 01:03:09.263
Um. I don't know if you're out
but if you are. I'll just wait.

1102
01:03:09.394 --> 01:03:10.917
I've got the key. Okay.

1103
01:03:33.461 --> 01:03:34.941
Sara?

1104
01:03:48.476 --> 01:03:49.913
Hello?

1105
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:52.872
Who are you?

1106
01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:56.615
I was just. uh.
fixing the cabinet door.

1107
01:03:56.745 --> 01:03:58.791
Oh. So you're Colin?

1108
01:03:58.922 --> 01:04:02.360
I'm Sara's friend Lucy.
I've heard so much about you.

1109
01:04:05.363 --> 01:04:06.973
Um. okay.

1110
01:04:07.104 --> 01:04:08.105
Well. I'll let you get back
to what you're doing.

1111
01:04:08.235 --> 01:04:09.802
Um. I've been dying
to look around

1112
01:04:09.933 --> 01:04:12.413
and I'm sure
Sara will be back soon.

1113
01:04:44.097 --> 01:04:47.231
Hey. Luce. I'm home.
Are you here?

1114
01:04:51.365 --> 01:04:52.758
Lucy?

1115
01:05:03.551 --> 01:05:04.988
Hi. You've reached Lucy.

1116
01:05:05.118 --> 01:05:07.773
I'm away from my phone.
so just leave me a...

1117
01:05:13.779 --> 01:05:15.346
There's no
evidence of forced entry.

1118
01:05:15.476 --> 01:05:16.956
She probably went out
for a walk.

1119
01:05:17.087 --> 01:05:18.436
No.

1120
01:05:18.566 --> 01:05:19.524
She wouldn't have
left me that message

1121
01:05:19.654 --> 01:05:21.613
and then turn off her phone.

1122
01:05:21.743 --> 01:05:23.963
And she wouldn't have asked me
to wait here.

1123
01:05:24.094 --> 01:05:26.226
And now her car is here
and she's not?

1124
01:05:26.357 --> 01:05:28.185
You're sure no one else
has the house key?

1125
01:05:28.315 --> 01:05:31.014
Besides Jordyn and I. no.
Just Lucy.

1126
01:05:31.144 --> 01:05:32.450
And you have no idea

1127
01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.842
what she had to tell you
about this house?

1128
01:05:33.973 --> 01:05:36.410
None at all.

1129
01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:38.282
She told me to wait here.

1130
01:05:38.412 --> 01:05:40.371
And now her car...

1131
01:05:40.501 --> 01:05:42.634
Why don't I go
get you a drink. huh?

1132
01:05:42.764 --> 01:05:45.158
Yeah. that's exactly
what she needs.

1133
01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:47.030
-Jordyn.
-Let's get you a water.

1134
01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.596
Okay. Thank you.

1135
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.648
Mom. are you gonna tell him?

1136
01:05:58.389 --> 01:05:59.651
About the strange things

1137
01:05:59.781 --> 01:06:01.958
that have been happening
in this house?

1138
01:06:03.655 --> 01:06:05.178
Come on.

1139
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:07.485
Weird things have been happening
ever since we moved in.

1140
01:06:18.496 --> 01:06:20.106
A couch got moved.

1141
01:06:20.237 --> 01:06:21.934
a shadow box
that was taken off of the wall.

1142
01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:23.283
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1143
01:06:23.414 --> 01:06:24.719
And put back
on the wall.

1144
01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:27.287
There was this
disturbing painting of us

1145
01:06:27.418 --> 01:06:29.246
that was at our front doorstep.

1146
01:06:29.376 --> 01:06:31.509
You think someone broke in
and did all that?

1147
01:06:31.639 --> 01:06:34.207
No. it all happened
at different times

1148
01:06:34.338 --> 01:06:36.601
over the last couple of weeks.

1149
01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:39.125
It's like someone else
is living in the house with us

1150
01:06:39.256 --> 01:06:41.127
and just doing messed up things.

1151
01:06:41.258 --> 01:06:43.956
Okay. Start from the beginning.

1152
01:06:51.094 --> 01:06:53.313
I'm gonna walk
the periphery of the house.

1153
01:06:53.444 --> 01:06:55.924
I mean. do you think that
she could've just wandered off?

1154
01:06:56.055 --> 01:06:57.535
No. I think someone

1155
01:06:57.665 --> 01:06:59.798
might be getting
inside the house.

1156
01:07:01.234 --> 01:07:02.801
I'm gonna see him out.

1157
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:07.893
Detective.

1158
01:07:09.199 --> 01:07:13.594
I was hoping we could have
a moment in private.

1159
01:07:13.725 --> 01:07:15.466
Okay.

1160
01:07:15.596 --> 01:07:17.294
I'm not sure
if you picked up on it

1161
01:07:17.424 --> 01:07:19.905
but. uh. Jordyn. well.

1162
01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:23.169
she really
doesn't care much for me.

1163
01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:26.520
Or I should say she doesn't
approve of me dating her mother.

1164
01:07:26.651 --> 01:07:28.653
And this is relevant because?

1165
01:07:28.783 --> 01:07:29.480
Sara.

1166
01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:31.395
She's just been under

1167
01:07:31.525 --> 01:07:33.658
a tremendous amount
of stress lately.

1168
01:07:33.788 --> 01:07:37.183
that combined with a daughter
who's. well. you know.

1169
01:07:37.314 --> 01:07:40.926
let's just say she might not
be remembering things correctly.

1170
01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:44.495
Mr. Murray. are you telling me
what I just heard was all lies?

1171
01:07:44.625 --> 01:07:48.064
No. No. no. not lies
but maybe. um. you know.

1172
01:07:48.194 --> 01:07:50.631
unintentional exaggerations.

1173
01:07:50.762 --> 01:07:53.025
It could be that Sara
moved those things back

1174
01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:55.462
and she just doesn't remember.

1175
01:07:55.593 --> 01:07:57.203
You think she's delusional?

1176
01:07:57.334 --> 01:07:59.858
No. but she has a new job

1177
01:07:59.988 --> 01:08:03.383
and. you know.
difficult teenager.

1178
01:08:03.514 --> 01:08:05.429
a challenging ex.

1179
01:08:05.559 --> 01:08:06.734
She's just been
under a lot of strain

1180
01:08:06.865 --> 01:08:11.087
and I just wanted you to know.

1181
01:08:11.217 --> 01:08:13.306
Hmm. Tell me. Mr. Murray.

1182
01:08:13.437 --> 01:08:15.917
how long have you been
seeing Ms. Wilson?

1183
01:08:16.048 --> 01:08:20.139
Oh. uh. a few weeks.

1184
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:21.401
A few weeks?

1185
01:08:21.532 --> 01:08:23.011
And you feel you gained

1186
01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:26.362
a good perspective
in that small amount of time?

1187
01:08:26.493 --> 01:08:31.063
Yes.
Well. we've gotten very close.

1188
01:08:31.193 --> 01:08:34.458
Okay. Thanks for filling me in.

1189
01:08:38.288 --> 01:08:41.682
Now. if you'll excuse me.
I'm going to check the grounds.

1190
01:08:41.813 --> 01:08:43.380
Sure.

1191
01:09:56.496 --> 01:09:58.629
Would you like me
to stick around?

1192
01:09:58.759 --> 01:10:00.500
I could order in food
for dinner.

1193
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:03.199
Yeah. I don't want Jordyn and I

1194
01:10:03.329 --> 01:10:05.636
to be alone here tonight.

1195
01:10:05.766 --> 01:10:07.725
I just hope Lucy's okay.

1196
01:10:07.855 --> 01:10:10.467
What if something
happened to her here?

1197
01:10:12.077 --> 01:10:13.818
This damn house.

1198
01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:17.952
It's not the house's fault.

1199
01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:19.824
My friend is missing.

1200
01:10:19.954 --> 01:10:22.305
I'm just wondering when
the bad things are gonna stop?

1201
01:10:22.434 --> 01:10:24.523
I'm sorry to interrupt.
But I found something.

1202
01:10:24.655 --> 01:10:26.787
- What is it?
- A small room next

1203
01:10:26.918 --> 01:10:29.355
to the pool area.
Someone's been living in there.

1204
01:10:29.486 --> 01:10:31.009
A small room?

1205
01:10:31.139 --> 01:10:33.751
A mattress. some clothes.

1206
01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.621
Oh. and a glass that has...

1207
01:10:35.753 --> 01:10:40.018
get this. the Prohibition
Amendment written on it.

1208
01:10:40.148 --> 01:10:41.889
What?

1209
01:10:51.986 --> 01:10:54.772
I'm gonna need back-up
at the Wilson residence.

1210
01:11:02.606 --> 01:11:04.782
Looks like the cops are leaving.

1211
01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:11.092
Oh. I don't wanna stay
in this house tonight.

1212
01:11:11.223 --> 01:11:13.660
I get it.

1213
01:11:13.791 --> 01:11:17.098
-Can I stay at your place?
-I wish. but my mom

1214
01:11:17.228 --> 01:11:20.450
will definitely say no to us
being together overnight.

1215
01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:24.628
Please?

1216
01:11:29.241 --> 01:11:31.896
My parents just won't allow it.

1217
01:11:32.026 --> 01:11:34.507
Even if you tell them everything
that happened here?

1218
01:11:34.638 --> 01:11:37.162
But you don't wanna leave
your mom here all alone.

1219
01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:41.732
I will call first thing
in the morning.

1220
01:11:41.862 --> 01:11:43.386
Don't be mad.

1221
01:11:44.778 --> 01:11:47.259
You and your mom
will be safe tonight.

1222
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:54.484
Don't worry.

1223
01:11:54.614 --> 01:11:56.790
I have patrol cars
driving around the area.

1224
01:11:56.921 --> 01:11:59.880
-We'll keep looking.
-You know. before today.

1225
01:12:00.011 --> 01:12:02.448
the two people I would've called
in this situation

1226
01:12:02.579 --> 01:12:04.320
would have been Lucy or Colin.

1227
01:12:08.193 --> 01:12:10.108
Here's my personal cell.

1228
01:12:10.237 --> 01:12:11.849
You hear anything.

1229
01:12:11.978 --> 01:12:15.548
see anything. you call me.

1230
01:12:15.679 --> 01:12:17.507
Thank you.

1231
01:12:17.637 --> 01:12:19.422
Thank you. Detective.

1232
01:12:43.532 --> 01:12:46.797
Come in.

1233
01:12:46.927 --> 01:12:48.799
Noah just left.

1234
01:12:48.929 --> 01:12:50.452
Are you okay?

1235
01:12:52.716 --> 01:12:54.978
No.

1236
01:12:55.109 --> 01:12:57.503
I mean. do we have
to stay here tonight. Mom?

1237
01:12:57.634 --> 01:12:59.984
Can't we go to a motel?

1238
01:13:00.114 --> 01:13:02.726
There's some sort of conference
happening in town.

1239
01:13:02.856 --> 01:13:06.251
I checked and everything's
booked up.

1240
01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:10.210
Detective Bryant says there's
officers patrolling the area.

1241
01:13:10.342 --> 01:13:13.389
I mean. he says there's no way
Colin would come back tonight.

1242
01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:16.827
But he's obsessed
with the house.

1243
01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:17.915
Yeah. I know.

1244
01:13:18.045 --> 01:13:20.744
But if he came back
he'd be caught.

1245
01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:23.660
Ugh.

1246
01:13:25.705 --> 01:13:27.490
Can I sleep in here
with you tonight?

1247
01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.753
Of course. sweetie.

1248
01:13:29.883 --> 01:13:32.799
Why don't you get changed?
And I'll make us some tea.

1249
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:35.280
Okay. Thanks.

1250
01:14:08.487 --> 01:14:10.054
What is that?

1251
01:14:20.543 --> 01:14:23.415
Oh. my God. Lucy?

1252
01:14:25.678 --> 01:14:27.071
Lucy!

1253
01:14:28.289 --> 01:14:29.900
Lucy!

1254
01:14:51.878 --> 01:14:53.837
Oh. my God. Lucy.

1255
01:14:53.967 --> 01:14:55.403
Lucy.

1256
01:14:55.534 --> 01:14:57.014
Oh. my God. Lucy.

1257
01:14:59.407 --> 01:15:00.800
Okay.

1258
01:15:01.975 --> 01:15:04.934
Hurry. before he comes back.
Hurry. Hurry.

1259
01:15:05.065 --> 01:15:06.458
That's him! He's back!

1260
01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:09.026
Okay. go. go. Go. go. go.

1261
01:15:09.156 --> 01:15:10.809
You run.

1262
01:15:14.771 --> 01:15:18.775
All I wanted was to share
this house with you. Sara.

1263
01:15:18.905 --> 01:15:21.429
That's why you need
to put that down.

1264
01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:23.606
so nobody gets hurt.

1265
01:15:23.736 --> 01:15:26.870
Okay. Colin. Colin. please.

1266
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.047
We don't wanna hurt
this house. do we?

1267
01:15:30.177 --> 01:15:32.397
I won't let them
take me out of here!

1268
01:15:55.115 --> 01:15:57.639
Please. Please. stop!

1269
01:16:02.993 --> 01:16:04.734
No! Don't go in there!

1270
01:16:07.214 --> 01:16:08.520
No! No! No!

1271
01:16:08.651 --> 01:16:11.088
-Please. please.
-Let go! Let go!

1272
01:16:11.218 --> 01:16:13.351
Stop! Hey!

1273
01:16:13.481 --> 01:16:14.918
I never meant to hurt you. Sara.

1274
01:16:15.048 --> 01:16:18.398
I didn't leave you
that painting.

1275
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:21.620
We could've been so happy here.

1276
01:16:21.751 --> 01:16:23.579
Get your disgusting hands
off of my mom.

1277
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:25.276
The police are on their way.
Get out!

1278
01:16:28.279 --> 01:16:29.976
-Mom!
-Jordyn!

1279
01:16:30.107 --> 01:16:31.848
Mommy.

1280
01:16:35.112 --> 01:16:37.809
It's normal for criminals
to deny things.

1281
01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:40.204
He wasn't in his right mind.

1282
01:16:41.205 --> 01:16:43.163
-Oh. thank you. sweetie.
-I think what you mean to say

1283
01:16:43.294 --> 01:16:45.644
is that my mom
was not in her right mind.

1284
01:16:45.775 --> 01:16:48.038
She could've gotten killed
going after him.

1285
01:16:48.168 --> 01:16:50.431
The important thing
is you're both safe.

1286
01:16:50.562 --> 01:16:54.348
Officers picked him up before he
even made it to your front gate.

1287
01:16:54.478 --> 01:16:57.395
And my boys did a sweep
of the whole house

1288
01:16:57.525 --> 01:17:01.181
and there's no cameras.
just a lot of clever peepholes.

1289
01:17:01.312 --> 01:17:04.010
-We'll be taking care of those.
-Yeah.

1290
01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:07.492
Well. you ladies stay put.
And I'll let myself out.

1291
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.672
Well. we're gonna play
hooky tomorrow.

1292
01:17:13.803 --> 01:17:16.196
-I'll make pancakes.
-Hmm.

1293
01:17:18.895 --> 01:17:20.460
Oh. good.

1294
01:17:20.592 --> 01:17:22.986
Lucy says the doctor doesn't
think she has a concussion.

1295
01:17:23.116 --> 01:17:24.814
-Oh.
-Well. then.

1296
01:17:24.943 --> 01:17:27.730
-we'll invite her to join us.
-Uh-hmm.

1297
01:17:37.478 --> 01:17:38.392
Hey.

1298
01:17:38.523 --> 01:17:40.830
- Hi.
- Hi.

1299
01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.615
I wanted to see
how you're doing.

1300
01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:45.791
Oh. we had a really rough night

1301
01:17:45.922 --> 01:17:48.925
actually last night.
kind of unbelievable.

1302
01:17:49.055 --> 01:17:52.318
Yeah. I know.
That's why I'm here.

1303
01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:54.234
Really? How did you hear?

1304
01:17:54.365 --> 01:17:56.933
I have a contact down
at the police department.

1305
01:17:57.063 --> 01:17:59.413
I need to know the goings
on around town.

1306
01:17:59.544 --> 01:18:02.242
-you know. so that I can--
-Oh. yeah. yeah.

1307
01:18:02.373 --> 01:18:04.157
Well. we were fine.

1308
01:18:04.288 --> 01:18:06.986
rattled but fine.

1309
01:18:07.117 --> 01:18:09.423
I'm so glad you guys are okay.

1310
01:18:09.554 --> 01:18:11.034
I was so worried.

1311
01:18:11.164 --> 01:18:14.037
Thank you.
Do you wanna come inside?

1312
01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:17.867
Have you had the chance

1313
01:18:17.996 --> 01:18:20.696
to consider the offer
on the house?

1314
01:18:22.959 --> 01:18:24.830
It's funny you should ask.

1315
01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:28.050
Jordyn and I talked
about it this morning.

1316
01:18:28.181 --> 01:18:30.967
Be careful.
Sorry. it is scalding hot.

1317
01:18:31.097 --> 01:18:33.534
Oh. it's okay.

1318
01:18:33.665 --> 01:18:35.058
After everything
that's happened.

1319
01:18:35.188 --> 01:18:38.888
I can imagine
that you'd wanna leave.

1320
01:18:39.018 --> 01:18:41.673
Yeah. You'd think. right?

1321
01:18:41.804 --> 01:18:44.675
That's why it's so unexpected.
you know. that Jordyn and I.

1322
01:18:44.807 --> 01:18:48.027
we decided we're gonna stay.

1323
01:18:48.157 --> 01:18:50.682
-What?
-Yeah.

1324
01:18:50.813 --> 01:18:53.206
I think this whole experience.

1325
01:18:53.337 --> 01:18:55.731
you know. has brought us
close together. and...

1326
01:18:55.861 --> 01:18:57.558
we're gonna make
our new start here.

1327
01:18:57.689 --> 01:19:01.258
You know. like we planned.
instead of running.

1328
01:19:01.388 --> 01:19:03.564
Plus. I think it'd be really
hard to find another house

1329
01:19:03.695 --> 01:19:06.219
with the indoor pool. right?

1330
01:19:07.438 --> 01:19:09.875
I don't know. Sara. I. uh...

1331
01:19:10.005 --> 01:19:12.094
I think you should reconsider.

1332
01:19:14.227 --> 01:19:16.708
My client. I mean.

1333
01:19:16.839 --> 01:19:19.058
he just really wants this house.

1334
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:21.713
Oh. well. I'm sorry. Kendall.

1335
01:19:21.844 --> 01:19:24.629
but we really wanna stay.

1336
01:19:31.679 --> 01:19:33.246
Um...

1337
01:19:48.653 --> 01:19:50.263
Are you okay?

1338
01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:04.451
No. Sara. I'm not okay.

1339
01:20:04.582 --> 01:20:07.759
I needed you to sell this house
to my buyer.

1340
01:20:07.889 --> 01:20:10.588
Don't you get it? I'm the buyer.

1341
01:20:10.718 --> 01:20:13.286
Okay. Just put the knife down.

1342
01:20:13.416 --> 01:20:15.201
-We can talk about this.
-It's too late for that.

1343
01:20:15.332 --> 01:20:17.813
-Hey. Mom. have you seen--
-No. no. no. Jordyn!

1344
01:20:22.034 --> 01:20:23.340
Oh!

1345
01:20:23.469 --> 01:20:25.385
Jordyn! Oh. my God.

1346
01:20:25.516 --> 01:20:27.126
Are you okay?

1347
01:20:29.302 --> 01:20:30.956
She made me do it!

1348
01:20:31.087 --> 01:20:34.177
Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

1349
01:20:34.307 --> 01:20:37.049
Look...

1350
01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:40.183
This is just a house. okay?

1351
01:20:43.055 --> 01:20:44.621
Why?

1352
01:20:44.752 --> 01:20:46.842
Why are you doing this?

1353
01:20:49.714 --> 01:20:51.759
Mary Weather Industries.

1354
01:20:51.889 --> 01:20:55.894
they're one of the largest
conglomerates in the world.

1355
01:20:56.025 --> 01:20:59.157
They're going to invest
two billion dollars

1356
01:20:59.289 --> 01:21:01.943
just to revitalize this area.

1357
01:21:02.074 --> 01:21:04.642
And at the heart
of their endeavor.

1358
01:21:04.772 --> 01:21:08.166
where they plan to put
their corporate campus...

1359
01:21:09.473 --> 01:21:10.909
you guessed it.

1360
01:21:12.084 --> 01:21:14.913
It's right here
in your lovely home.

1361
01:21:15.044 --> 01:21:17.873
So you're planning
on selling our land

1362
01:21:18.003 --> 01:21:20.571
to Mary Weather Industries?

1363
01:21:22.398 --> 01:21:24.270
Oh.

1364
01:21:24.401 --> 01:21:28.535
It's going to make me very rich.

1365
01:21:28.666 --> 01:21:32.626
When you told me about
all the real scary things

1366
01:21:32.757 --> 01:21:34.889
that were going on
in this house.

1367
01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:38.197
I figured it out way
before you did.

1368
01:21:39.068 --> 01:21:41.374
I knew it was the former owner.

1369
01:21:41.505 --> 01:21:44.160
I mean. clearly. this Colin guy

1370
01:21:44.290 --> 01:21:47.032
couldn't let go of his home.

1371
01:21:47.163 --> 01:21:50.427
And he even became obsessed
with you in it.

1372
01:21:50.557 --> 01:21:53.299
And. you know.
I was actually worried

1373
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:57.477
that you would get in
the way of my plan.

1374
01:21:57.608 --> 01:21:58.914
He helped me.

1375
01:21:59.044 --> 01:22:01.394
So the only thing
I had left to do

1376
01:22:01.525 --> 01:22:06.008
is find a way to scare you
to make you finally leave.

1377
01:22:06.138 --> 01:22:07.661
Why didn't you
just explain to me

1378
01:22:07.791 --> 01:22:10.360
that Mary Weather Industries
wanted our property?

1379
01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:13.580
I mean. the commission alone
would've made you rich.

1380
01:22:14.712 --> 01:22:17.715
The commission alone...

1381
01:22:17.844 --> 01:22:20.109
would have given me peanuts.

1382
01:22:21.893 --> 01:22:23.503
- Jordyn.
- Mom.

1383
01:22:42.782 --> 01:22:44.655
No!

1384
01:22:44.785 --> 01:22:46.483
No!

1385
01:23:08.548 --> 01:23:09.985
Mom!

1386
01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:14.119
Mom!

1387
01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:15.512
Jordyn.

1388
01:23:16.904 --> 01:23:17.993
Are you okay?

1389
01:23:18.123 --> 01:23:19.516
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. Mom.

1390
01:23:20.734 --> 01:23:22.300
I'm so sorry that I--

1391
01:23:22.432 --> 01:23:24.216
I stopped listening to you.
and trusting you and--

1392
01:23:24.347 --> 01:23:27.741
No. It's okay. I'm sorry
for being such a brat.

1393
01:23:27.871 --> 01:23:30.266
I love you. honey. so much.

1394
01:23:30.396 --> 01:23:31.528
I love you. too.

1395
01:23:32.485 --> 01:23:33.573
Are you okay?

1396
01:23:33.704 --> 01:23:35.010
Yeah.

1397
01:23:38.796 --> 01:23:40.537
Oh. my God. Oh. my God.

1398
01:23:46.412 --> 01:23:48.023
Okay.

1399
01:23:57.597 --> 01:23:59.077
Let me just find a couple more
of these

1400
01:23:59.208 --> 01:24:01.123
-and I can start a fire.
-Thank you. Noah.

1401
01:24:01.818 --> 01:24:03.299
This is beautiful.

1402
01:24:03.429 --> 01:24:05.518
I was thinking I'd collect
a bunch of these.

1403
01:24:05.648 --> 01:24:07.520
and put them in a vase
at the front entrance.

1404
01:24:07.651 --> 01:24:09.000
I love that idea.

1405
01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:10.480
What do you guys want
for dinner?

1406
01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:12.177
Um. souffle...

1407
01:24:12.308 --> 01:24:15.224
or coq au vin.

1408
01:24:15.353 --> 01:24:17.313
How about some pizza?

1409
01:24:17.443 --> 01:24:19.141
Come on. Mom.
