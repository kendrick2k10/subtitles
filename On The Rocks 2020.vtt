00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.534
And remember.
don't give your heart to any boys.

4
00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.619
You're mine.

5
00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.120
Until you get married.

6
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.665
Then you're still mine.

7
00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.251
Okay. Dad.

8
00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:16.618
Where are we going?

9
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.081
It's gonna be fun. Come on.

10
00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:13.175
Nobody tells you
that once you get married.

11
00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.927
you will never fuck again.

12
00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.138
If you like fucking.
marriage ain't for you.

13
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:21.725
Shit. I haven't fucked in seven years.

14
00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:23.685
I've had intercourse.

15
00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:44.498
Hi.

16
00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:48.627
Hi.

17
00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:55.425
Hi.

18
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.608
-Mom. can I have some juice?
-Yes.

19
00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:13.485
-How was London?
-London was great.

20
00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.404
-Yeah?
-English guys are in for 20%.

21
00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:16.446
-Really?
-Yeah.

22
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.698
-Well done.
-Thank you.

23
00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:21.660
We have to put a deposit down
on that house for July. That week in July.

24
00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.620
And I have to figure that out by tomorrow.

25
00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:27.124
Baby. I don't know what's happening then.
okay? Listen. But I'll check. okay?

26
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.709
-Come here. Kisses. Come on.
-We're so late.

27
00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:31.670
And Jimmy's new restaurant.
Thursday or Friday?

28
00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.714
I just have to let him know
'cause they're really busy.

29
00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:34.631
Okay. Thursday.

30
00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.341
-Put your shoes on. please. Please.
-Bye.

31
00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:37.759
-I love you. Bye.
-Bye. Bye.

32
00:03:38.302 --> 00:03:39.678
-Come on. Theo.
-Hey.

33
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.847
-Any more questions?
-Cute.

34
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.224
-Please put your shoes on.
-I want the princess shoes.

35
00:03:44.308 --> 00:03:47.227
You gotta put your real shoes on.
We're so late. okay?

36
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:48.437
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:51.857
Okay. Sorry. Gotta go. Gotta go.

38
00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:54.026
Okay.

39
00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:58.739
-Did you finish your reading?
-Yeah.

40
00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:01.158
-Yeah?
-I finished my reading too.

41
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.618
What? You did?

42
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.163
-Mom. we're really late.
-Okay. Okay.

43
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.540
-Hey. let's get coffee this weekend.
-Oh. yeah. For sure.

44
00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:11.543
Okay. okay.
Help Mommy. okay? Take your toy.

45
00:04:11.627 --> 00:04:12.878
Okay.

46
00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.047
I'll come fix it for you.

47
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.214
Wait up for me!

48
00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:19.384
-Okay. have a good day.
-Bye.

49
00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:20.594
-Love you.
-Goodbye.

50
00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:21.720
-Bye. Bye.
-Bye.

51
00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.180
-Okay. Okay.
-Hi.

52
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.973
-Hi.
-I know. I look awful.

53
00:04:25.057 --> 00:04:26.308
-No.
-I just had a peel.

54
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.310
My face will be red and flaky for a week.

55
00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.604
But then it'll be so smooth.
you won't believe it.

56
00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.231
Okay. Okay. Let's go.

57
00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:34.942
Laura. What a stroke of luck.
Hi. little boo-boo.

58
00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:37.778
We need to have coffee.
I'm sure you don't have time.

59
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:40.656
But we need to have coffee.
I'm seeing that guy again.

60
00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.324
-Are you?
-Yeah. it's happening.

61
00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:44.493
And I actually think it's fine.

62
00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.079
-Yeah.
-But for me. I cannot stop texting him.

63
00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.830
-Right.
-But then I text him. and I'm like.

64
00:04:48.914 --> 00:04:51.500
"I know that every time I text you.
I'm pushing you farther away."

65
00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.169
But then I do that. and I keep doing it.
I cannot stop myself.

66
00:04:54.253 --> 00:04:55.254
Right.

67
00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:59.174
And then I'm like. "Okay. you know what?
Be tender. Be tender with yourself."

68
00:04:59.258 --> 00:05:01.718
Because this is
a matter of the heart. you know?

69
00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:04.847
It's like.
we had an affair during Hurricane Sandy.

70
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.099
Like. the entire thing is something

71
00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:10.477
that I'm trying to look at
with introspection and empathy. And--

72
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:12.563
-I'm so sorry. but we actually have to go.
-Oh. no.

73
00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:15.023
-But I'll see you soon.
-I'm so sorry. I'll text you. Yeah.

74
00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:16.316
Okay. Bye.

75
00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:21.780
-Laura.
-Hi.

76
00:05:21.864 --> 00:05:22.906
Hi. I'm so late.

77
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.950
-Okay. Talk to you later. Bye.
-Have a good one. Bye.

78
00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.034
Get in.

79
00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.372
Can you please
put on your seat belt for me?

80
00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:34.168
Read me another story.

81
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:35.836
Go to sleep.

82
00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:42.384
-Can I ask you a weird question?
-Sure.

83
00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.303
Well. last night Dean got back.

84
00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:47.347
He was really out of it.
He takes Xanax on the plane.

85
00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.604
And he started kissing me.
and then he heard my voice.

86
00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:57.816
And it was like I woke him up.
He was surprised and stopped.

87
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.069
It was almost like
he thought I was someone else.

88
00:06:01.153 --> 00:06:02.154
What?

89
00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:06.325
That's weird. But he was just out of it.

90
00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:07.701
Yeah. I guess.

91
00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.621
He's such a good guy. And he adores you.

92
00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:14.374
You know. he's traveling
with clients all the time. and...

93
00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:18.629
I'm just the buzzkill
waiting to schedule things. I--

94
00:06:19.338 --> 00:06:20.756
I can't even write.

95
00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.926
I should've never
sold a book before writing it.

96
00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.346
That's okay.
Give yourself a break. You have a toddler.

97
00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:31.433
And you'll get back to work
when you're ready.

98
00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:38.876
-All right. hang on.
-Yeah.

99
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:42.004
I can hear you now.

100
00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.506
What do you think...
from a man's point of view?

101
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.301
Am I crazy?

102
00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:50.095
No. He thought you were someone else.

103
00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:51.722
What? You think so?

104
00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:52.806
Absolutely.

105
00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:57.811
You're just dark and don't know anything
about a committed relationship.

106
00:07:57.895 --> 00:07:58.979
Really?

107
00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:00.063
Yes. really.

108
00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:02.524
You need to start thinking like a man.

109
00:08:02.608 --> 00:08:03.650
Felix!

110
00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:05.485
Thanks. Dad. That's really helpful.

111
00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:07.821
Is that a birthmark?

112
00:08:07.905 --> 00:08:11.074
You know. I don't know why
I asked you of all people. Never mind.

113
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.493
If you need me. I'm here.

114
00:08:13.577 --> 00:08:14.578
Hang on. shorty.

115
00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:21.793
You there. shorty?

116
00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:25.380
Enjoy Paris. Have a French 76 for me.

117
00:08:25.464 --> 00:08:30.427
I can try. Call if you need anything.
I'll be back soon. I love you.

118
00:08:30.511 --> 00:08:31.512
Bye.

119
00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:39.852
Mommy! Mommy!

120
00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:43.148
Time for the llama's haircut?

121
00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:45.692
No. I have to wash her first.

122
00:08:47.653 --> 00:08:48.779
It's okay.

123
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.160
First. I'm gonna give you a bath.

124
00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:08.340
We're gonna clean you up.

125
00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:17.140
I'm gonna brush your hair.

126
00:09:23.272 --> 00:09:25.941
I'm brushing your hair. little llama.

127
00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:28.485
Brush. brush. brush.

128
00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:30.988
Will I see you and the girls this weekend?

129
00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.156
-Your mother and sister are coming.
-Theo.

130
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.286
You know what. Gran?
Can I-- Can I just call you back?

131
00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:39.413
I'm taking Theo to a class.

132
00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:40.497
See you then.

133
00:09:40.581 --> 00:09:43.375
Three. four. five. six.

134
00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.378
Got it. Good job.

135
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:55.762
Wheels on the bus go round and round
All over town

136
00:09:55.846 --> 00:09:58.765
The horn on the bus goes
Beep. beep. beep

137
00:09:58.849 --> 00:10:00.684
-Hi.
-Beep. beep. beep

138
00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:01.894

00:10:17.868 --> 00:10:20.746
Row. row. row your boat
Gently down the stream

143
00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:24.917
Merrily. merrily. merrily. merrily
Life is but a dream

-Fiona. So good to finally meet you.
-I'll be right back.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.136
I'm sorry. Dean must've told you. there's
just so much going on here right now.

158
00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.556
-Yeah.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:23.517
with the new offices opening
and everything. and--

160
00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:29.356
I heard that the guys from A24 were here.
I have to go speak with them.

161
00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:32.985
We just started working with the Ghosts.
Have you seen them?

162
00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:35.487
-No.
-Yeah. They're actually really good.

163

173
00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:06.810
Great.

174
00:12:12.024 --> 00:12:15.694
Congrats! Guys! 500K!

175
00:12:16.862 --> 00:12:18.989
-Well done. team!
-Congrats.

176
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:22.492
Five hundred K. It's all you. How sweet.

177
00:12:23.202 --> 00:12:24.286
All of us.

178
00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:26.413
-Thank you. guys. Thank you.
-Thank you.

179
00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:27.372
Yeah.

180
00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:29.041
-Well done.
-Thank you.

181
00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:31.919
-We made it this...
-Really did...

182
00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:33.045
I know.

183
00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:34.630
Great party.

184
00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:36.632
Told you
the party would go smoothly.

185
00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.550
-Why didn't you trust me?
-Okay.

186
00:12:38.634 --> 00:12:39.843
-All right!
-Bye!

187
00:12:41.512 --> 00:12:43.388
Babe. what a night.

188
00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:46.725
Five hundred thousand new followers.
We're killing it.

189
00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:50.187
The amount of engagement. the insight.
I mean. this is crazy.

190
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.522
I mean...

191
00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:55.943
between our briefs. our team. the amount
of. like. the ROIs. return on investments.

192
00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:57.444
we're crushing it.

193
00:12:57.528 --> 00:12:58.946
-So great.
-Yeah.

194
00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:03.283
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

195
00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:11.917
I found a woman's toiletry case
when I was unpacking your bag.

196
00:13:14.837 --> 00:13:15.963
That's Fiona's.

197
00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:21.093
She couldn't fit it in her carry-on.
so I put it in my luggage.

198
00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:22.761
I must've forgot about it. so...

199
00:13:24.096 --> 00:13:26.139
-Right.
-Yeah.

200
00:13:26.223 --> 00:13:29.142
I'll just bring it to her
tomorrow at the office. Thank you.

201
00:13:44.867 --> 00:13:48.370
Let me have it. Let me have it.

202
00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:50.581
Okay. okay. Ready.

203
00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:52.791
Did anyone see my brush?

204
00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.376
We're going to see Grandma.

205
00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:55.586
And Mommy's grandma.

206
00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:57.171
-Bye. babies.
-Bye.

207
00:13:57.254 --> 00:13:58.338
-Bye.
-Say bye.

208
00:13:58.422 --> 00:14:00.799
-Bye. Love you.
-Love you.

209
00:14:00.883 --> 00:14:03.552
-Have fun with your family.
-Yeah. right. Thanks.

210
00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:06.054
-Okay. Try to have fun with your family.
-Okay.

211
00:14:06.138 --> 00:14:08.140
Love you. If you need me.
I'll be at the office.

212
00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:09.224
-Okay.
-All right?

213
00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:10.934
Say bye.

214
00:14:11.018 --> 00:14:12.477
-Bye. girls.
-Bye.

215
00:14:12.561 --> 00:14:14.271
-I love you.
-Bye. Love you.

216
00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.355
Love you.

217
00:14:15.439 --> 00:14:16.440
-Bye.
-You too.

218
00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:17.649
Bye.

219
00:14:17.733 --> 00:14:21.320
-Hey. Gran. How are you?
-So glad you're here.

220
00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:26.491
I laid out on the terrace last night
looking at the stars. It was glorious.

221
00:14:26.575 --> 00:14:27.993
That's so nice.

222
00:14:29.578 --> 00:14:32.164
How's the apartment?
Did you finish the bedroom?

223
00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:35.334
They just finished. and it is so cheerful.

224
00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:40.214
I could be in there with five blizzards
and not get depressed.

225
00:14:40.297 --> 00:14:41.673
That's so nice.

226
00:14:41.757 --> 00:14:45.093
I just got a luscious cream rug
from Cogolin.

227
00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:48.055
You know. Laura...

228
00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:53.018
if you're going to dress that way.
you could make more of an effort.

229
00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:55.103
Please. Gran. I think she looks terrific.

230
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:57.731
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

231
00:14:57.814 --> 00:15:00.692
I talked to Dad the other day.
He's in Paris.

232
00:15:00.776 --> 00:15:02.528
How is Felix?

233
00:15:02.611 --> 00:15:05.364
You know. his usual chipper self.

234
00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:06.615
I wonder what he's up to.

235
00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:09.910
Well. he does keep himself amused.

236
00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:13.705
He was always a handful.
since he was a little boy.

237
00:15:13.789 --> 00:15:16.792
He could never stay put for very long.

238
00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:18.794
Never really knew what he was thinking.

239
00:15:19.628 --> 00:15:21.004
I don't know how you can deal with him.

240
00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:24.842
Your father owes me a visit.

241
00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:30.764
Is Dean still traveling a lot
with that new assistant?

242
00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:33.809
Account manager.

243
00:15:34.226 --> 00:15:35.727
Yeah. She's--

244
00:15:36.103 --> 00:15:37.437
Yeah. she seems nice.

245
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.439
She very attractive?

246
00:15:39.523 --> 00:15:42.526
I don't know.
I mean-- Yeah. she's attractive.

247
00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:47.322
New York is filled
with attractive women though.

248
00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:49.449
Well. okay.

249
00:15:50.576 --> 00:15:51.785
French fry?

250
00:15:51.869 --> 00:15:53.328
No. Thank you.

251
00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:54.997
They're so good.

252
00:15:58.208 --> 00:15:59.209
Come on.

253
00:16:01.545 --> 00:16:04.965
-Come on. Maya! Come on!
-You better not use my markers.

254
00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:07.426
-Mom says you have to share.
-Mom!

255
00:16:58.101 --> 00:16:59.895
Mom. she's pulling my hair!

256
00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:02.731
Don't do that! Stop!

257
00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:05.358
She's hurting me. Mom. Dad!

258
00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:06.734
Mommy!

259
00:17:07.528 --> 00:17:09.530
-Mommy!
-To be continued.

260
00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:13.200
Where's my toothbrush?

261
00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:15.743
Mom. did you remember
to check my homework?

262
00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.748
-Yes. It's on the bench in the hallway.
-Can you pick up my little guy?

263
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.333
He's trying to get you.

264
00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:23.710
Brush. please.

265
00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:25.628
-Please brush.
-Okay.

266
00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.172
-Go get your book bag.
-Okay.

267
00:17:27.256 --> 00:17:28.674
Rinse. rinse. rinse.

268
00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.135
-Thank you.
-Hurry up!

269
00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:34.555
Can I have a cookie? Can I have a cookie?

270
00:17:34.638 --> 00:17:37.766
No. you cannot have a cookie.
We just had breakfast.

271
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.769
And it's not just. like. a sexual thing.

272
00:17:40.853 --> 00:17:42.813
Because he's coming to me.

273
00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:44.773
I'm the one with the ideas
for our company.

274
00:17:44.857 --> 00:17:46.692
-Right.
-You know? And this whole thing started

275
00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:49.653
because I was like. "You know what?
Why are nails not more ornamental?"

276
00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:52.614
Obviously. they're functional. We need
them to hold our furniture together.

277
00:17:52.698 --> 00:17:54.700
But. you know. I was like.
"It's about these small details

278
00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:57.119
that actually aren't just details.
They can be treasures."

279
00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:59.621
And he was like. "That was really--
That's really inspiring."

280
00:17:59.705 --> 00:18:03.375
In fact. just having this conversation
is how we ended up being together.

281
00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:05.210
-Okay. see you later.
-Okay. bye. bye. bye.

282
00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:10.048
One. two. three.

283
00:18:10.132 --> 00:18:14.011
four. five. six. eight.

284
00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:19.266
...twinkle. little star
Like a diamond in the...

285
00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:42.789
Hey. kiddo.

286
00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:46.460
Feel like hopping in?

287
00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:47.794
Feel like scooting over?

288
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.966
Hi. Dad.

289
00:18:54.927 --> 00:18:56.470
You can still break my ribs.

290
00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:59.556
-Hi. Musto.
-Hi. Laura. Nice to see you.

291
00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:03.769
Mus. you know that this one
is named after the song...

292
00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:09.274
Laura is the face in the misty night

293
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.611
Footsteps that you hear down the hall

294
00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:13.862
You know this one. Musto?

295
00:19:13.946 --> 00:19:18.242
The laugh. Musto
That floats on a summer night

296
00:19:18.325 --> 00:19:23.705
That you can never quite recall

297
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:25.999
-It's one of my favorites.
-Lead part. please.

298
00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:32.214
-I can't whistle.
-Come on.

299
00:19:32.798 --> 00:19:33.882
No. seriously.

300
00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:41.139
No. I can't anymore.
It's so weird. Ever since I had kids.

301
00:19:41.223 --> 00:19:43.684
No kid of mine is gonna stop whistling.

302
00:19:44.893 --> 00:19:46.478
We're working on this. Come on.

303
00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:50.399
Nice bracelet.

304
00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:51.483
Thank you.

305
00:19:52.693 --> 00:19:56.822
The bangle is a reminder
that women were once men's property.

306
00:19:57.322 --> 00:20:00.033
I'm sure that's exactly
what Dean was going for.

307
00:20:04.413 --> 00:20:06.164
Do you think I'm underdressed?

308
00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:07.875
You just show 'em your cute mug.

309
00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:15.591
Oh. my gosh. do you look beautiful.

310
00:20:18.177 --> 00:20:19.678
You're about to see Cliff.

311
00:20:20.596 --> 00:20:23.432
-Hello. Mr. Keane.
-Cliff. How's your mom's hip?

312
00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:24.975
-Good. thanks.
-Good.

313
00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:28.729
You tell her to do her exercises or she
may as well have kept the old one.

314
00:20:29.855 --> 00:20:31.231
Good afternoon. Mr. Keane.

315
00:20:31.315 --> 00:20:32.900
He thinks you're my girlfriend.

316
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.908
Hey. I'll have a Cutty on the rocks
and a Bombay martini for the kid.

317
00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:43.410
Okay.

318
00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:47.956
You know what's interesting?

319
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.585
Back when humans walked on all fours.

320
00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:57.174
it was the sight of the female haunches
that excited them.

321
00:20:57.966 --> 00:21:01.261
So that when
we finally stood up on two legs.

322
00:21:01.345 --> 00:21:05.682
it was the women with the rounded breasts
that mirrored the haunches

323
00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:07.935
that were most exciting to the males.

324
00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:10.395
So. they made babies with them.

325
00:21:10.479 --> 00:21:14.399
and eventually. that shape
evolved into what is our modern female.

326
00:21:14.483 --> 00:21:15.859
Wow.

327
00:21:15.943 --> 00:21:19.780
And men were attracted
to adolescent females

328
00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:23.867
because they were easier to catch.
therefore ultimately easier to mate.

329
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.746
And slowly over time. these qualities...

330
00:21:28.622 --> 00:21:29.831
small size...

331
00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:32.709
smooth skin...

332
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:34.920
high voice...

333
00:21:35.379 --> 00:21:37.089
little or no beard...

334
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.134
evolved into the qualities
most desired today.

335
00:21:41.844 --> 00:21:44.847
So they prefer no beard? Good to know.

336
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.306
Like you.

337
00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:49.560
Thank you.

338
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:53.981
Ballet dancer.

339
00:21:56.108 --> 00:21:58.110
Yes. I studied at the Bolshoi.

340
00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.741
Dad. can we order? 'Cause I gotta get back
and pick up the kids.

341
00:22:04.825 --> 00:22:05.826
Sure.

342
00:22:06.535 --> 00:22:08.871
I'll have the rib eye.
well done. with spinach.

343
00:22:09.246 --> 00:22:11.582
I'll have the chopped salad. please.
Thank you.

344
00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:17.880
Can you ever just act normal
around any woman?

345
00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:21.133
She's a ballet dancer.
They love to be complimented.

346
00:22:24.136 --> 00:22:26.597
So. do you miss having the gallery?

347
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.725
No.
I still have the odd deal here and there.

348
00:22:30.142 --> 00:22:32.686
Did I tell you I got a new assistant?
Few days.

349
00:22:32.769 --> 00:22:33.979
That's good.

350
00:22:36.231 --> 00:22:37.900
You know what's great about her?

351
00:22:39.318 --> 00:22:42.446
She doesn't talk. She just listens.

352
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:44.823
That sounds perfect for you.

353
00:22:46.867 --> 00:22:49.703
So Dean's going away a lot?
On business trips?

354
00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:52.789
Dad. not everyone is like you.

355
00:22:52.873 --> 00:22:56.293
Where was he coming back from
when he was acting so strange?

356
00:22:56.376 --> 00:22:58.128
-London.
-London.

357
00:22:59.588 --> 00:23:00.589
Where was he staying?

358
00:23:01.173 --> 00:23:03.634
I think it was Blakes?

359
00:23:03.717 --> 00:23:07.095
-Blakes?
-Blakes. Yeah. Why?

360
00:23:08.013 --> 00:23:09.473
Blakes is a

361
00:23:09.932 --> 00:23:15.229
cozy. little off-the-beaten-track hotel

362
00:23:15.312 --> 00:23:18.732
that I wouldn't stay at
if I were on a business trip.

363
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:30.744
I know a concierge over at Claridge's.
He knows all the concierges.

364
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.704
When was he there?

365
00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:36.959
Last week.
but let's not get carried away. okay?

366
00:23:42.381 --> 00:23:43.799
There was something.

367
00:23:45.092 --> 00:23:46.093
What?

368
00:23:49.263 --> 00:23:50.264
Never mind.

369
00:23:52.516 --> 00:23:53.809
What?

370
00:23:58.021 --> 00:23:59.147
There were some...

371
00:24:00.774 --> 00:24:03.819
There were some of his
coworker's toiletries in his luggage.

372
00:24:04.403 --> 00:24:05.696
Sloppy move.

373
00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:10.117
But she couldn't put them
in her carry-on through security.

374
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.245
so he offered to put them in his luggage.
That's it.

375
00:24:13.787 --> 00:24:16.290
Raise your hand if that sounds fishy.

376
00:24:16.373 --> 00:24:19.251
You know what?
I shouldn't have said anything. Forget it.

377
00:24:19.334 --> 00:24:21.545
-Have you checked his phone?
-No.

378
00:24:21.628 --> 00:24:24.506
Well. do yourself a favor.
check his text messages.

379
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:29.511
If it's-- I mean. it may come to nothing.
but. you know. may as well make sure.

380
00:24:29.595 --> 00:24:31.889
Dean is not like you.

381
00:24:31.972 --> 00:24:34.600
Okay. he's a nerd.
He's a good guy. A great dad.

382
00:24:34.683 --> 00:24:36.810
He's a man. It's nature.

383
00:24:37.853 --> 00:24:43.734
Males are forced to fight to dominate
and to impregnate all females.

384
00:24:51.283 --> 00:24:52.326
Sorry.

385
00:24:53.493 --> 00:24:56.246
I remember the first time
I saw your mother.

386
00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:00.292
It was a beach party.
Back then. all the girls wore bikinis.

387
00:25:01.001 --> 00:25:06.465
Your mother walked out of the ocean
in a white one-piece swimming suit.

388
00:25:07.132 --> 00:25:09.009
and that was it for me. I was done.

389
00:25:10.385 --> 00:25:11.553
Staying on track...

390
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.140
what does Dean have planned
for your birthday?

391
00:25:16.016 --> 00:25:17.893
He's not gonna be here for my birthday.

392
00:25:17.976 --> 00:25:21.146
What kind of guy
forgets his wife's birthday?

393
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.523
He didn't forget.

394
00:25:22.606 --> 00:25:25.150
He has a work trip. but we're gonna
celebrate when he gets back.

395
00:25:25.234 --> 00:25:26.401
That's not the same.

396
00:25:28.237 --> 00:25:31.532
I traveled. I never missed a birthday.

397
00:25:31.615 --> 00:25:34.910
Right.
But you had some other shortcomings.

398
00:25:38.038 --> 00:25:39.081
Like what?

399
00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:44.962
Thank you.

400
00:25:51.844 --> 00:25:53.554
All right. I'm gonna take you to 21.

401
00:25:54.012 --> 00:25:56.348
Just do me a favor.
Check his texts. will you?

402
00:25:57.015 --> 00:25:59.852
And if there's anything else
you can think about London...

403
00:26:02.354 --> 00:26:05.232
At some point. we can make a decision
about whether to tap his phone.

404
00:26:05.315 --> 00:26:07.359
-No.
-Laura. come on.

405
00:26:07.442 --> 00:26:09.862
He should be worshipping
the ground you walk on.

406
00:26:09.945 --> 00:26:12.489
and if he's not. you need to know.

407
00:26:14.491 --> 00:26:16.201
Now. it's probably nothing. but...

408
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.002
check his phone.

409
00:26:27.254 --> 00:26:28.714
Do I swim?

410
00:26:28.797 --> 00:26:29.882
Yes.

411
00:26:29.965 --> 00:26:31.758
Am I green?

412
00:26:31.842 --> 00:26:33.051
-Yes.
-Yes.

413
00:26:33.135 --> 00:26:36.305
Do I make this noise? Gribbit.

414
00:26:37.139 --> 00:26:38.265
Yes.

415
00:26:39.975 --> 00:26:42.269
No? Yes?

416
00:26:42.352 --> 00:26:43.854
Hey. did you change your password?

417
00:26:43.937 --> 00:26:45.314
You're sometimes green.

418
00:26:45.397 --> 00:26:48.483
I was trying to send
that cute picture of the girls to my mom.

419
00:26:50.027 --> 00:26:53.780
Yeah. there's a new
security protocol at work.

420
00:26:53.864 --> 00:26:57.159
They just change it up
for some reason. so... Here.

421
00:26:58.327 --> 00:27:00.370
You sure you don't wanna use your phone?

422
00:27:00.454 --> 00:27:02.122
No. I don't have that picture.

423
00:27:02.497 --> 00:27:03.874
-Okay.
-Thanks.

424
00:27:05.792 --> 00:27:06.793
-You good?
-Yeah.

425
00:27:06.877 --> 00:27:07.711
Okay.

426
00:27:07.794 --> 00:27:09.129
All right. girls. Daddy gotta get to work.

427
00:27:09.213 --> 00:27:10.797
-Bye.
-Gimme a kiss.

428
00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:13.884
Hey. be nice. And be nice to Mommy.

429
00:27:13.967 --> 00:27:15.093
-Bye. Daddy.
-I love you.

430
00:27:15.177 --> 00:27:16.637
-Love you.
-Love you.

431
00:27:17.179 --> 00:27:19.640
Sorry I'm not gonna be here
for your birthday.

432
00:27:19.723 --> 00:27:21.642
-I'll make it up soon as I get back. okay?
-Yeah.

433
00:27:21.725 --> 00:27:22.726
-All right.
-Okay.

434
00:27:23.685 --> 00:27:24.561
-Bye.
-Bye.

435
00:27:24.645 --> 00:27:26.855
I need to have some for breakfast.

436
00:27:29.024 --> 00:27:31.944
No! Definitely no.

437
00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:51.380
Grandpa!

438
00:27:52.214 --> 00:27:53.632
You can still fly.

439
00:27:54.466 --> 00:27:56.176
Where can I toss you folks out?

440
00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.261
Ready?

441
00:27:58.178 --> 00:28:00.806
-My God.
-We're going to ballet. 51 Walker Street.

442
00:28:00.889 --> 00:28:03.183
I'd love to.
You been working on your whistling?

443
00:28:03.267 --> 00:28:04.518
Not really.

444
00:28:04.601 --> 00:28:05.602
Shove over. tiny.

445
00:28:05.686 --> 00:28:08.522
-Hi. Musto.
-Hi. guys. Nice to see you again.

446
00:28:08.605 --> 00:28:09.898
You too.

447
00:28:09.982 --> 00:28:11.441
Honey. put your seat belt on.

448
00:28:12.067 --> 00:28:14.361
-All right. let's take it from the top.
-Okay.

449
00:28:16.572 --> 00:28:18.365
Emerald City. As quick as lightning.

450
00:28:18.448 --> 00:28:19.449
Just. like. air.

451
00:28:19.533 --> 00:28:22.911
It helps to have a little bit more belly.
Try to get it from the belly.

452
00:28:26.164 --> 00:28:27.583
It's useless.

453
00:28:28.208 --> 00:28:29.334
I'm sorry. hey.

454
00:28:29.418 --> 00:28:31.587
Sorry. Wanna go say hi?

455
00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.173
You did a really great job today.
Great job.

456
00:28:34.673 --> 00:28:36.383
-Hey.
-Hi.

457
00:28:36.758 --> 00:28:37.968
Hi.

458
00:28:38.051 --> 00:28:39.052
Hi.

459
00:28:39.136 --> 00:28:41.555
Maya. my precious.

460
00:28:42.598 --> 00:28:45.809
It's been too long.
I can't live without you.

461
00:28:46.143 --> 00:28:48.187
Are you gonna come take my class? Hey.

462
00:28:48.645 --> 00:28:49.938
You're in fourth position.

463
00:28:51.231 --> 00:28:52.608
Yeah. Yeah.

464
00:28:52.691 --> 00:28:54.026
Dad. this is Miss Mindy.

465
00:28:54.109 --> 00:28:56.111
Hello. Miss Mindy.

466
00:28:56.862 --> 00:28:58.697
-Goodbye. Miss Mindy. Thank you.
-Okay.

467
00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.073
-See you next week.
-Bye. Miss Mindy.

468
00:29:00.157 --> 00:29:01.867
-Say bye. Maya. Okay.
-Bye.

469
00:29:05.078 --> 00:29:08.749
Right this way. ladies. Ladies and ladies.

470
00:29:10.709 --> 00:29:12.753
-Musto. pull over a second.
-You got it.

471
00:29:12.836 --> 00:29:15.839
I want a unicorn balloon.
Yeah. yeah. the unicorn.

472
00:29:16.089 --> 00:29:18.717
A. you're adorable

473
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.428
-B. you're so beautiful
-Come on. guys.

474
00:29:21.512 --> 00:29:25.307
-C. you're a cutie full of charm
-Okay.

475
00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.976
I'm gonna jump in the shower quick.
Can you just watch them?

476
00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:28.894
-Sure.
-Come on.

477
00:29:28.977 --> 00:29:30.854
-D. you're delightful
-You wanna watch something?

478
00:29:30.938 --> 00:29:33.357
-And E. you're exciting
-Let's go.

479
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.361
And F. you smell like you own a farm

480
00:29:45.577 --> 00:29:47.246
Does my foot smell funny?

481
00:29:48.497 --> 00:29:51.375
-'Cause I was wondering--
-We're watching Breaking Bad.

482
00:29:51.458 --> 00:29:53.168
-What?
-It's really good.

483
00:29:53.252 --> 00:29:54.962
It's a great show. Have you seen it?

484
00:29:55.045 --> 00:29:58.048
Yes. I have seen it.
It's great. It's not for kids.

485
00:29:58.131 --> 00:30:00.008
What? Was there something bad on?

486
00:30:00.092 --> 00:30:01.552
No.

487
00:30:01.635 --> 00:30:03.512
-Yeah.
-Hey. look. I can shuffle.

488
00:30:04.513 --> 00:30:06.098
Wow. That's great.

489
00:30:06.181 --> 00:30:10.811
We learned that all young girls
should know how to shuffle. And how to...

490
00:30:10.894 --> 00:30:12.104
Bluff.

491
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:14.189
Bluff. Right.

492
00:30:14.273 --> 00:30:15.357
And how do you bluff?

493
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.234
-Poker face.
-Poker face.

494
00:30:18.026 --> 00:30:19.027
Poker face.

495
00:30:19.903 --> 00:30:20.904
Poker face.

496
00:30:21.321 --> 00:30:22.781
Nice. nice.

497
00:30:24.241 --> 00:30:27.035
And that girls should wear their hair
long and pretty. how boys like it.

498
00:30:27.119 --> 00:30:31.123
Or you can wear it short.
or however you wanna wear it.

499
00:30:31.206 --> 00:30:33.208
-Long and pretty.
-Long and pretty.

500
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.335
Don't listen to him. okay?

501
00:30:35.419 --> 00:30:38.630
You're gonna grow up.
and you're gonna be strong women

502
00:30:38.714 --> 00:30:41.049
who get to wear their hair
however they like.

503
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.886
Now it's dinnertime.
What were you drinking?

504
00:30:43.969 --> 00:30:45.304
We made egg creams.

505
00:30:45.387 --> 00:30:49.141
You were all out of Fox's U-bet.
But we made do.

506
00:30:49.641 --> 00:30:51.560
This is not good before dinner.

507
00:30:52.144 --> 00:30:53.979
Well. nobody wants one after dinner.

508
00:30:54.062 --> 00:30:55.063
Yeah.

509
00:30:55.147 --> 00:30:58.192
Time to wash our hands.
Let's go. Dinnertime.

510
00:30:58.275 --> 00:31:00.152
Let's get going. Jump over. Jump.

511
00:31:00.861 --> 00:31:02.321
Wash your feet too.

512
00:31:02.404 --> 00:31:06.116
You two guys drop food on the floor
too much.

513
00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.534
And it's wasteful.

514
00:31:07.618 --> 00:31:09.995
Clean toes. pop that back into your mouth.

515
00:31:10.078 --> 00:31:12.581
Ten-second rule. Learn to respect it.

516
00:31:13.707 --> 00:31:14.917
Can we have burgers?

517
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.251
All right. I'm off.

518
00:31:16.335 --> 00:31:18.045
We're gonna talk
about your birthday tomorrow?

519
00:31:18.128 --> 00:31:19.796
Oh. yeah.

520
00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.258
Actually. I don't really feel like
celebrating my birthday this year.

521
00:31:23.342 --> 00:31:27.846
The celebration of the date of one's birth
was originally a pagan tradition.

522
00:31:28.347 --> 00:31:31.934
Historically. Christians didn't celebrate
for that very reason.

523
00:31:32.017 --> 00:31:33.727
Now. we're past that. aren't we?

524
00:31:34.728 --> 00:31:39.650
Kids. Do you want a mom who doesn't want
to get taken out for cake and ice cream?

525
00:31:39.733 --> 00:31:40.984
-Ice cream. Ice cream!
-Ice cream!

526
00:31:41.068 --> 00:31:43.362
-I just don't feel like it. okay?
-Please?

527
00:31:43.445 --> 00:31:44.988
We'll talk tomorrow. okay?

528
00:31:45.072 --> 00:31:46.823
-I love you all.
-Love you.

529
00:31:46.907 --> 00:31:50.452
The biggest one the most
and then in descending order.

530
00:31:50.994 --> 00:31:52.454
Keep up the good work.

531
00:31:52.955 --> 00:31:54.248
Bye. Grandpa!

532
00:31:54.331 --> 00:31:55.541
Bye. Grandpa.

533
00:31:58.585 --> 00:32:01.380
Hey. Felix. You're back in town.

534
00:32:01.463 --> 00:32:03.131
-I am.
-Yes. you are.

535
00:32:04.007 --> 00:32:05.092
Been busy?

536
00:32:05.175 --> 00:32:07.594
Yeah. Got a lot going on.

537
00:32:08.345 --> 00:32:09.346
Do you?

538
00:32:10.055 --> 00:32:11.056
Yeah.

539
00:32:12.015 --> 00:32:13.350
-Well.
-You good?

540
00:32:13.809 --> 00:32:15.352
-Yeah. I'm good.
-All right.

541
00:32:16.812 --> 00:32:18.605
-You?
-I'm great.

542
00:32:21.316 --> 00:32:23.068
-Good night.
-Good night.

543
00:32:29.867 --> 00:32:30.868
Where to?

544
00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.705
Let's go home.

545
00:33:26.965 --> 00:33:28.091
Here you go. Thank you.

546
00:33:29.885 --> 00:33:32.679
So. do you want anything
back from Los Angeles?

547
00:33:32.763 --> 00:33:34.598
Where do I start?

548
00:33:34.681 --> 00:33:36.350
Sounds expensive.

549
00:33:36.433 --> 00:33:37.726
-Love you.
-Love you.

550
00:33:37.809 --> 00:33:39.144
Hey. cheer up.

551
00:33:40.938 --> 00:33:41.939
-Bye.
-Bye. Dad.

552
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.483
Have fun.

553
00:33:44.942 --> 00:33:46.902
-Bye.
-Can't have fun without you guys.

554
00:33:47.945 --> 00:33:49.404
That's my reality right now.

555
00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:54.451
And actually. now that I think about it.
perhaps she did show me some strength.

556
00:33:54.535 --> 00:33:57.037
because here I am.
standing in my own power.

557
00:33:57.663 --> 00:34:00.582
Those flowers are pretty. Wow.

558
00:34:00.666 --> 00:34:04.628
Wow. So pretty. Look at these flowers.

559
00:34:04.711 --> 00:34:07.297
-You can pull them out if you want to.
-They're so nice.

560
00:34:07.381 --> 00:34:10.300
-Yeah. if you wanna pull them out--
-Do you think they're from Daddy?

561
00:34:10.384 --> 00:34:11.552
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

562
00:34:12.553 --> 00:34:13.971
They're from my daddy.

563
00:34:17.391 --> 00:34:20.726
"Behind the speaker's platform
hung an oil painting. richly framed.

564
00:34:20.811 --> 00:34:26.525
depicting the mouse in Aesop's fable in
its heroic act of freeing a captive lion.

565
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:28.819
Well. it's like this"--

566
00:34:30.152 --> 00:34:31.196
Look. it's Daddy.

567
00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.040
-Hi. Hi.
-Hi. Hi. birthday girl.

568
00:34:42.123 --> 00:34:43.125
Hi. babies.

569
00:34:43.208 --> 00:34:44.042
-Hi.
-Hi.

570
00:34:44.126 --> 00:34:45.543
Greetings from Hollywood.

571
00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:47.212
How's your birthday?

572
00:34:47.838 --> 00:34:50.174
Good. It's pretty mellow.
It's really nice.

573
00:34:50.257 --> 00:34:51.675
Nice. Good.

574
00:34:51.757 --> 00:34:55.179
Babies. go get the gift
that we wrapped for Mommy.

575
00:34:55.971 --> 00:34:57.054
I'm gonna get it.

576
00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:59.933
-Miss you guys so much.
-Miss you too.

577
00:35:00.392 --> 00:35:02.352
That's sneaky.

578
00:35:02.436 --> 00:35:04.396
-You guys planned this?
-Just a little.

579
00:35:04.479 --> 00:35:05.856
Do you think she's gonna like it?

580
00:35:05.939 --> 00:35:07.900
-You look good.
-Thanks.

581
00:35:07.983 --> 00:35:09.484
-How's it going?
-It's right there.

582
00:35:09.568 --> 00:35:10.819
Miss that little smile.

583
00:35:13.322 --> 00:35:17.117
Okay. now listen. the gift. I want you
to understand. it's a little different.

584
00:35:17.201 --> 00:35:20.078
What is this enormous box?

585
00:35:20.162 --> 00:35:21.955
It's nerdy. but it's actually really cool.

586
00:35:22.039 --> 00:35:23.498
Is this-- Do you wanna come help Mommy?

587
00:35:23.582 --> 00:35:25.626
-Here. you take that.
-The girls helped me wrap it.

588
00:35:25.709 --> 00:35:28.086
-Okay. Okay. Yeah.
-Got to take the tie off.

589
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.380
-Start with the ribbon.
-Gonna help her open it?

590
00:35:30.464 --> 00:35:32.466
Baby. back up so I can see Mommy.

591
00:35:32.549 --> 00:35:34.092
What is it?

592
00:35:35.928 --> 00:35:37.513
All right. so this is different.

593
00:35:39.014 --> 00:35:40.015
Thermomix.

594
00:35:40.098 --> 00:35:42.309
Twelve different appliances
all rolled in one.

595
00:35:43.101 --> 00:35:48.023
It does. like. mixing. weighing.
kneading. chopping. everything.

596
00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:50.901
But. you know what.
it's perfect for. like. making things.

597
00:35:50.984 --> 00:35:53.612
Hey. guys.
you gonna make Mommy a big birthday pizza?

598
00:35:53.695 --> 00:35:55.447
-Yes.
-Yes.

599
00:35:55.531 --> 00:35:56.657
Thank you.

600
00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.452
There's one more part to your present.
but it's not ready yet. Okay?

601
00:36:00.536 --> 00:36:02.788
Can I call you back? I'm sorry.

602
00:36:02.871 --> 00:36:04.998
You know what. I got meetings.
I'll call you later. I love you.

603
00:36:05.082 --> 00:36:06.250
Bye. Love you.

604
00:36:08.794 --> 00:36:09.795
Hello?

605
00:36:09.878 --> 00:36:11.088
I'm down here.

606
00:36:12.673 --> 00:36:14.675
What? I told you I wasn't coming.

607
00:36:15.259 --> 00:36:17.052
Buzz me in.

608
00:36:17.135 --> 00:36:18.887
Yeah? Mama!

609
00:36:18.971 --> 00:36:20.806
Stop being so annoying.

610
00:36:22.099 --> 00:36:23.517
Get back in bed.

611
00:36:28.564 --> 00:36:30.190
Mommy.

612
00:36:30.274 --> 00:36:32.484
-Good night. Love you.
-Good night. Mom. Happy birthday.

613
00:36:32.568 --> 00:36:33.569
Thank you. honey.

614
00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.781
What are you...

615
00:36:38.866 --> 00:36:43.245
I'm taking you out.
You can't not celebrate your birthday.

616
00:36:43.328 --> 00:36:44.997
I don't have a babysitter.

617
00:36:45.581 --> 00:36:48.959
Musto. He's got four kids.
They're all still alive.

618
00:36:49.334 --> 00:36:51.628
Yeah. I'm sure he's great and everything.

619
00:36:51.712 --> 00:36:55.799
but you can't just show up here
and expect me to...

620
00:36:57.676 --> 00:36:59.469
I'm not taking

621
00:36:59.553 --> 00:37:03.098
"you just can't show up here
and expect me to"

622
00:37:03.182 --> 00:37:04.308
for an answer.

623
00:37:06.476 --> 00:37:07.519
Get dressed.

624
00:37:09.188 --> 00:37:13.150
Okay. I'll call Lucy.
the girl from downstairs.

625
00:37:13.233 --> 00:37:17.487
and I'll see if she's available.
but it's really. really short notice.

626
00:37:17.571 --> 00:37:19.740
So don't get excited.

627
00:37:22.409 --> 00:37:24.369
-Lucy. hi.
-Hi. Lucy!

628
00:37:24.453 --> 00:37:28.415
Hi. That's my dad. My dad's here.

629
00:37:29.249 --> 00:37:30.292
Yeah.

630
00:37:31.335 --> 00:37:35.547
Are you free by any chance to come over?
I just have this last-minute thing.

631
00:37:35.631 --> 00:37:39.718
I won't be too late.
Yeah. That'd be great.

632
00:37:39.801 --> 00:37:42.846
Thank you so much. Okay.

633
00:37:52.439 --> 00:37:53.440
Thank you.

634
00:37:56.235 --> 00:37:57.277
Hi. Musto.

635
00:37:57.361 --> 00:37:58.362
Hi. Laura.

636
00:38:05.911 --> 00:38:08.288
You look very lovely.

637
00:38:08.372 --> 00:38:09.456
Thank you.

638
00:38:10.874 --> 00:38:12.626
Musto. take us to 21.

639
00:38:12.709 --> 00:38:14.753
-21 it is.
-Thanks.

640
00:38:20.717 --> 00:38:22.344
So. did Dean take his trip?

641
00:38:22.845 --> 00:38:23.846
Yeah.

642
00:38:24.805 --> 00:38:26.431
Did he get you a nice present?

643
00:38:27.266 --> 00:38:28.475
He did. actually.

644
00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.561
Jewelry?

645
00:38:31.645 --> 00:38:36.275
No. He got me a nice present.
When are you gonna drop it about Dean?

646
00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:39.027
No little red box?

647
00:38:40.237 --> 00:38:41.655
What are you implying?

648
00:38:45.075 --> 00:38:49.663
I had him followed. Do you know
where he came from the other night?

649
00:38:49.746 --> 00:38:51.957
What? No. where?

650
00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:54.668
52nd and 5th.

651
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.211
So?

652
00:38:57.337 --> 00:38:58.547
It's Cartier.

653
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.760
You didn't get any present from there?

654
00:39:03.844 --> 00:39:04.845
No.

655
00:39:04.928 --> 00:39:06.430
At least we know he has taste.

656
00:39:07.472 --> 00:39:10.184
Now. what was he doing there?
Did you ever check his phone?

657
00:39:10.267 --> 00:39:13.187
Yes. There weren't any texts.

658
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.439
Well. that's really suspicious.

659
00:39:15.522 --> 00:39:19.610
If you're working with someone.
you're in close contact. Unless...

660
00:39:21.528 --> 00:39:22.696
he erased 'em.

661
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.698
That bastard.

662
00:39:25.365 --> 00:39:27.784
When did this acting strange start?

663
00:39:29.578 --> 00:39:32.581
He's just been distracted

664
00:39:32.664 --> 00:39:36.543
since he... started this company

665
00:39:36.627 --> 00:39:40.130
and started working with Fiona.

666
00:39:40.839 --> 00:39:42.674
Is Fiona Miss Toiletries?

667
00:39:44.343 --> 00:39:46.762
The tall business associate. yeah.

668
00:39:48.013 --> 00:39:51.850
I mean. how he could do this to you...
I could strangle him.

669
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.646
Here's the Plaza.
This is the place to have an affair.

670
00:39:55.729 --> 00:39:57.022
It has the most exits.

671
00:39:57.105 --> 00:39:58.899
Exits on three streets.

672
00:39:58.982 --> 00:40:00.984
Can any man be monogamous?

673
00:40:01.693 --> 00:40:05.531
Monogamy and marriage
are based on the concept of property.

674
00:40:05.614 --> 00:40:08.283
I've been married for 20 years.

675
00:40:08.367 --> 00:40:09.409
See?

676
00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:14.248
Women. you can't live with 'em.
you can't live without 'em.

677
00:40:15.082 --> 00:40:17.209
That doesn't mean
you have to live with 'em.

678
00:40:19.628 --> 00:40:22.798
Bogart's table.
Where he proposed to Bacall.

679
00:40:23.257 --> 00:40:24.258
Really?

680
00:40:25.467 --> 00:40:27.678
Happy birthday. kiddo.

681
00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:29.680
Thank you.

682
00:40:37.521 --> 00:40:38.981
Your watch.

683
00:40:39.064 --> 00:40:40.524
I love this.

684
00:40:40.607 --> 00:40:44.278
You used to like to wear that. I think
it might fit you a little better now.

685
00:40:44.653 --> 00:40:46.488
I've always loved this watch.

686
00:40:47.489 --> 00:40:50.993
I bought that for myself
after my first big sale.

687
00:40:51.076 --> 00:40:52.327
A de Kooning woman.

688
00:40:52.953 --> 00:40:54.580
I love it. Thank you.

689
00:40:56.206 --> 00:41:00.210
I remember the first moment. the moment.

690
00:41:00.836 --> 00:41:04.256
when I first recognized you as a person.

691
00:41:05.007 --> 00:41:06.300
We were in the country.

692
00:41:06.383 --> 00:41:12.014
You were about nine months old.
and you were sitting on the ground.

693
00:41:12.097 --> 00:41:17.311
and I picked you up. and your diaper
was sopping wet with mud and water. and...

694
00:41:17.394 --> 00:41:21.273
we looked at each other
and just started laughing. And...

695
00:41:22.941 --> 00:41:25.277
there you were. I saw who you were.

696
00:41:28.071 --> 00:41:29.281
And here we are.

697
00:41:32.784 --> 00:41:35.704
What next? I think we should follow him.

698
00:41:35.787 --> 00:41:37.164
-What?
-Yeah.

699
00:41:37.247 --> 00:41:39.875
I think we should keep an eye on him.
See what he's up to.

700
00:41:39.958 --> 00:41:41.543
No. I can't do that.

701
00:41:41.627 --> 00:41:43.670
I think you better see him in action.

702
00:41:45.422 --> 00:41:49.218
Well. they have a work dinner on Friday.

703
00:41:49.301 --> 00:41:50.302
Great.

704
00:41:51.178 --> 00:41:53.805
I'll change car. We'll tail him.

705
00:41:54.223 --> 00:41:57.142
Can you just act
a little less excited about this?

706
00:41:57.226 --> 00:41:59.978
Because this is my life.
and it might be falling apart.

707
00:42:00.896 --> 00:42:04.775
We gotta get you out of this limbo.
We gotta ease your troubled mind.

708
00:42:06.193 --> 00:42:07.361
Hey. Greg.

709
00:42:08.403 --> 00:42:11.281
Could we bring the little girl
a belly buster. please?

710
00:42:12.449 --> 00:42:17.454
I'm not worried about you. kiddo.
You've got brains. beauty and character.

711
00:42:17.538 --> 00:42:20.165
which is the most important thing
a person can have.

712
00:42:20.999 --> 00:42:24.878
Do you know a woman is at her most
beautiful between the ages of 35 and 39?

713
00:42:25.712 --> 00:42:29.758
Great. so I have many months left.

714
00:42:29.842 --> 00:42:33.679
Women are like flowers.
They're all beautiful at any age.

715
00:42:34.304 --> 00:42:37.099
Even dried flowers. You know...

716
00:42:37.182 --> 00:42:39.434
I don't know why women
get plastic surgery.

717
00:42:39.518 --> 00:42:41.186
Because of men like you.

718
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.814
I prefer the factory original.

719
00:42:44.982 --> 00:42:47.693
Yeah. and every other make and model.

720
00:42:49.278 --> 00:42:51.530
Thank you.
I'm gonna take that as a compliment.

721
00:42:52.072 --> 00:42:53.323
Are there two?

722
00:42:54.533 --> 00:42:55.617
Scared me.

723
00:42:58.287 --> 00:43:01.915
You know. I think everyone has a right
to their own privacy.

724
00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:06.420
But if he's doing something dishonorable.
you need to know

725
00:43:06.503 --> 00:43:09.923
and find out on your own terms.
so you can be prepared for anything.

726
00:43:10.007 --> 00:43:12.050
I don't think there's anything at all.
It may not be anything.

727
00:43:12.134 --> 00:43:14.303
We'll find out on Friday.
I'll pick you up. and we'll have some fun.

728
00:43:14.386 --> 00:43:15.387
No.

729
00:43:19.016 --> 00:43:21.393
And that way I'm. like.
I'm gonna take the risk.

730
00:43:21.476 --> 00:43:23.061
I'm gonna introduce him to Milo.

731
00:43:23.729 --> 00:43:25.939
-Yeah.
-It's. like. people to people meeting.

732
00:43:26.023 --> 00:43:28.942
Like. why does it have to be. like.
this guy that I'm sleeping with...

733
00:43:29.026 --> 00:43:30.027
-meets my son.
-Daddy!

734
00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:31.987
-Hey! Come here.
-You know what I mean?

735
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:33.572
-Mom.
-I'm so sorry.

736
00:43:33.655 --> 00:43:34.698
-Is that crazy?
-I'm so sorry.

737
00:43:34.781 --> 00:43:35.782
-Mom!
-Hi!

738
00:43:35.866 --> 00:43:36.867
Hi. Dad!

739
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:38.160
-How's my big girl?
-Daddy!

740
00:43:38.243 --> 00:43:41.330
-Hey. muffin! How's my baby?
-Hey.

741
00:43:41.413 --> 00:43:43.582
Hi. baby. How you doing?

742
00:43:43.665 --> 00:43:45.792
-Good.
-How's the birthday girl? How was the day?

743
00:43:45.876 --> 00:43:47.044
-You know.
-Yeah?

744
00:43:47.127 --> 00:43:51.006
-My dad. Lots of theories and stories.
-Okay.

745
00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:56.553
So. what do you say we go around
the corner and we can celebrate properly?

746
00:43:56.637 --> 00:43:57.763
Yeah. that sounds nice.

747
00:43:57.846 --> 00:43:59.014
-Okay. good.
-I'll call a sitter.

748
00:43:59.097 --> 00:44:00.098
All right.

749
00:44:00.182 --> 00:44:01.475
How was your trip?

750
00:44:03.101 --> 00:44:04.520
-How was your trip?
-The trip?

751
00:44:04.603 --> 00:44:06.104
-Yeah.
-Great. Very productive.

752
00:44:06.188 --> 00:44:08.106
-Yeah?
-Yep. Found an office.

753
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:11.818
had some great meetings.
We found this really fun karaoke bar.

754
00:44:13.028 --> 00:44:14.446
We had so much fun.

755
00:44:17.783 --> 00:44:18.825
Yeah. it's really cool.

756
00:44:18.909 --> 00:44:20.744
They have these 3D-printed homes

757
00:44:20.827 --> 00:44:23.080
that they can put up for. like.
a few thousand dollars.

758
00:44:23.163 --> 00:44:24.831
and they can do it in. like. a day.

759
00:44:24.915 --> 00:44:27.459
It's really great.
Like. if there's a disaster or something.

760
00:44:27.543 --> 00:44:29.628
you can just rebuild an entire community.

761
00:44:29.711 --> 00:44:31.505
Wow. That's really cool.

762
00:44:31.588 --> 00:44:33.590
-Technology. man. It's crazy.
-Yeah.

763
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:37.511
How's the thing?

764
00:44:37.594 --> 00:44:38.679
Writing?

765
00:44:42.015 --> 00:44:45.227
Yeah. I don't know.
I'm so used to writing at night.

766
00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:50.691
So. sitting at my desk during the day.
it just feels. like. creatively stifling.

767
00:44:51.692 --> 00:44:52.860
You just have to start.

768
00:44:53.944 --> 00:44:54.945
Yeah.

769
00:44:58.156 --> 00:45:00.617
Sorry.
I just gotta handle this thing for work.

770
00:45:00.701 --> 00:45:02.703
Make sure this text went through.

771
00:45:02.786 --> 00:45:05.998
We just landed another account.
It's crazy.

772
00:45:09.126 --> 00:45:14.006
You know. I'm just wondering. should we
enroll Theo in preschool this year?

773
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:17.134
Because. you know. she's on the cusp.
and I don't wanna wait too long.

774
00:45:17.217 --> 00:45:18.635
and the deadline's soon.

775
00:45:18.719 --> 00:45:19.887
What do you think?

776
00:45:21.138 --> 00:45:22.973
Whatever. I mean. I trust you.

777
00:45:28.353 --> 00:45:29.688
Do you wanna go? It's loud.

778
00:45:29.771 --> 00:45:31.315
Yeah. Yeah.

779
00:45:32.482 --> 00:45:33.483
Excuse me.

780
00:45:33.984 --> 00:45:35.319
Yeah. let's get outta here.

781
00:45:39.198 --> 00:45:40.199
The wine was good.

782
00:45:40.282 --> 00:45:41.283
Yeah?

783
00:45:41.867 --> 00:45:43.076
Dinner was good.

784
00:45:57.257 --> 00:45:59.051
-I'm sorry. Did you want a cake?
-No.

785
00:45:59.134 --> 00:46:01.178
I thought you hate
when they do that in restaurants.

786
00:46:01.261 --> 00:46:03.055
-No. it's fine. It's fine.
-So I'm just--

787
00:46:03.138 --> 00:46:05.349
I didn't wanna embarrass you.
so I didn't get it.

788
00:46:05.432 --> 00:46:06.433
No. It's fine.

789
00:46:06.517 --> 00:46:08.101
-If you want cake. it's really simple.
-I don't.

790
00:46:08.185 --> 00:46:11.104
-I'm gonna get you a cake. Excuse me!
-No. Dean. I don't want one.

791
00:46:56.984 --> 00:47:00.070
Okay. you have to go to sleep.
Okay? Good night.

792
00:47:00.445 --> 00:47:02.114
-I love you.
-Good night. I love you.

793
00:47:02.197 --> 00:47:03.949
-Please go to sleep.
-Okay.

794
00:47:04.032 --> 00:47:08.328
Yes? Yes? You go to sleep. Go to sleep.

795
00:47:08.412 --> 00:47:09.621
-Okay.
-Love you.

796
00:47:12.749 --> 00:47:14.293
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

797
00:47:14.376 --> 00:47:15.794
I'll just be a few hours.

798
00:47:15.878 --> 00:47:18.630
-Okay. Okay. sounds good.
-It's just a dinner thing. Okay.

799
00:47:18.714 --> 00:47:20.215
Thank you so much. Thanks.

800
00:47:25.053 --> 00:47:27.472
This is your idea of incognito?

801
00:47:27.848 --> 00:47:29.474
They'll never see us coming.

802
00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:32.102
We have supplies too.

803
00:47:33.478 --> 00:47:34.563
Hop in. cutie.

804
00:47:36.648 --> 00:47:38.609
Let's make a night of it.

805
00:47:52.206 --> 00:47:54.166
-Where are we going?
-Soho House.

806
00:47:54.249 --> 00:47:57.085
-Why is he at Soho House?
-I don't know.

807
00:47:57.169 --> 00:48:00.464
So many great clubs in New York.
architecturally.

808
00:48:00.547 --> 00:48:05.302
Knickerbocker. The readings alone
at the Knickerbocker. please.

809
00:48:29.326 --> 00:48:30.619
Okay. we beat 'em.

810
00:49:06.154 --> 00:49:08.323
My guy at Claridge's got back to me.

811
00:49:09.616 --> 00:49:15.414
He said that Dean went to J.Sheekey's.
where he had reserved a four-top...

812
00:49:16.957 --> 00:49:18.375
which is a good cover.

813
00:49:19.585 --> 00:49:21.795
Or maybe they just went with clients.

814
00:49:23.005 --> 00:49:24.256
That's a possibility too.

815
00:49:24.339 --> 00:49:25.299
I think there's a reservation.

816
00:49:25.382 --> 00:49:26.800
There they are.

817
00:49:30.429 --> 00:49:32.055
Is it the one with all the legs?

818
00:49:33.515 --> 00:49:35.434
No. I can see them from here.

819
00:49:35.517 --> 00:49:36.435
There you go.

820
00:49:36.518 --> 00:49:39.813
-Thanks. Chivalry is not dead.
-Yeah. that's Fiona.

821
00:49:40.272 --> 00:49:42.774
Did I ever tell you about
the Rockette that I dated?

822
00:49:43.984 --> 00:49:45.110
Yeah.

823
00:49:58.665 --> 00:49:59.833
You know...

824
00:50:02.753 --> 00:50:06.757
the Russians fed the cosmonauts beluga.

825
00:50:07.925 --> 00:50:09.134
High protein.

826
00:50:10.385 --> 00:50:15.390
Their waste was nothing but a...
slight touch of ash.

827
00:50:16.308 --> 00:50:17.351
Really?

828
00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:22.981
We can call this caviar because...
there's no more beluga.

829
00:50:23.065 --> 00:50:25.984
But this is American-made.
and it's pretty good.

830
00:50:28.612 --> 00:50:31.323
Can a man ever be satisfied
with one woman?

831
00:50:31.406 --> 00:50:32.407
Come on.

832
00:50:32.908 --> 00:50:34.201
That's hardwiring.

833
00:50:34.284 --> 00:50:36.870
Keeping the species alive.

834
00:50:36.954 --> 00:50:40.165
I mean. the woman
passes through an emotional filter.

835
00:50:40.958 --> 00:50:43.210
Man doesn't pass through
the emotional part.

836
00:50:43.293 --> 00:50:47.381
It goes directly from the eyes to the ass.

837
00:50:49.633 --> 00:50:51.134
And it's just that simple?

838
00:50:53.762 --> 00:50:54.930
Okay. hardwire.

839
00:50:55.013 --> 00:50:59.852
so then how does a woman
keep her desirability to a man?

840
00:51:02.604 --> 00:51:04.439
A woman that knows that she is.

841
00:51:05.566 --> 00:51:11.655
A woman that is confident
in her effect on you. that's sexy.

842
00:51:14.575 --> 00:51:19.580
The Corsican...
wanted me to pull her hair... hard.

843
00:51:20.372 --> 00:51:23.041
And that just wasn't me.

844
00:51:23.834 --> 00:51:24.835
The Corsican?

845
00:51:26.086 --> 00:51:27.796
My God. It's Dean.

846
00:51:28.338 --> 00:51:30.257
-Okay. Just--
-What do I do? What do I do?

847
00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:33.552
Take it. but be cool. Breathe.

848
00:51:33.635 --> 00:51:34.761
Hey.

849
00:51:35.804 --> 00:51:36.638
Cool.

850
00:51:36.722 --> 00:51:40.934
No. everything's-- everything's fine.
I'm just about to go to sleep.

851
00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:46.648
Yeah. No. that's fine.

852
00:51:47.983 --> 00:51:49.943
After midnight? Yeah. no problem.

853
00:51:50.027 --> 00:51:51.028
Okay.

854
00:51:53.947 --> 00:51:55.949
That was pretty good for your first time.

855
00:51:57.534 --> 00:52:00.746
Code red.
He's cutting her out of the herd.

856
00:52:01.538 --> 00:52:02.998
"Oh. golly goodness.

857
00:52:03.081 --> 00:52:06.293
I don't think my long legs
will fit in that cab with all of them."

858
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:13.091
Taxi!

859
00:52:17.429 --> 00:52:18.972
-Good team.
-Are you coming?

860
00:52:19.056 --> 00:52:20.641
Okay. Scoot over.

861
00:52:21.099 --> 00:52:22.643
I can't believe this.

862
00:52:23.477 --> 00:52:25.812
All right. Let's get going.

863
00:52:25.896 --> 00:52:27.606
Hang on to those eggs. Here we go.

864
00:52:30.817 --> 00:52:32.361
Oh. my God. What are you doing?

865
00:52:32.444 --> 00:52:34.613
They're trying to lose us.
It's not gonna happen.

866
00:52:34.696 --> 00:52:36.198
We've got too much horsepower!

867
00:52:37.366 --> 00:52:38.867
You're driving crazy!

868
00:52:39.576 --> 00:52:40.953
Screw you. asshole!

869
00:52:41.036 --> 00:52:43.247
-Now. that wasn't nice. Thank you!
-Don't!

870
00:52:43.705 --> 00:52:44.706
Jerk!

871
00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:48.293
-Yeah. Jersey!
-Oh. God. Why are you driving like this?

872
00:52:48.377 --> 00:52:51.004
'Cause they're driving like this is why.
Hang on.

873
00:52:51.547 --> 00:52:52.840
Coming through!

874
00:52:54.842 --> 00:52:57.135
-You're--
-Come on. Not now. Not now.

875
00:52:57.928 --> 00:52:59.513
-Oh. my God.
-Hey. Come on. girl.

876
00:52:59.596 --> 00:53:03.725
Come on. Come on. Come on. darling.
There you go. Careful.

877
00:53:04.226 --> 00:53:06.520
-Brace yourself.
-Jesus. Dad.

878
00:53:06.603 --> 00:53:07.896
Nice. Nice.

879
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:08.939
Oh. my God.

880
00:53:09.022 --> 00:53:10.357
You are all in my way!

881
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.608
I'm gonna be sick.

882
00:53:11.692 --> 00:53:13.151
Lucky it's a convertible.

883
00:53:16.989 --> 00:53:19.366
Come on. There you go. There you go.

884
00:53:21.994 --> 00:53:23.662
They're turning! Hang on!

885
00:53:25.664 --> 00:53:26.915
Are you trying to kill us?

886
00:53:26.999 --> 00:53:29.168
He ran a red! And so did we!

887
00:53:33.005 --> 00:53:35.632
-Oops. We're gonna meet people.
-Oh. no.

888
00:53:35.716 --> 00:53:37.718
We're gonna make new friends. I'm afraid.

889
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:38.886
Sir. please pull over.

890
00:53:38.969 --> 00:53:40.179
Nothing to worry about.

891
00:53:47.186 --> 00:53:48.187
There you go.

892
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:01.116
Your license and registration. please.

893
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.035
And I'm gonna need you
to turn the engine off.

894
00:54:03.118 --> 00:54:04.661
I'm afraid I can't do that.

895
00:54:05.078 --> 00:54:06.413
Sir. turn the engine off.

896
00:54:06.496 --> 00:54:09.333
Listen. Here's the deal.
I'm stuck down here in second.

897
00:54:09.416 --> 00:54:10.584
The starter's overheating.

898
00:54:10.667 --> 00:54:12.377
If I turn it off.
I'm gonna lose it. and that'll be that.

899
00:54:12.461 --> 00:54:13.962
Sir. Turn it off.

900
00:54:14.963 --> 00:54:17.966
Okay. All right. Let's say goodbye to it.
'cause it's not gonna come back.

901
00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:19.051
That's fine.

902
00:54:20.177 --> 00:54:21.178
Hear that?

903
00:54:21.762 --> 00:54:22.971
Sir. is that alcohol?

904
00:54:23.055 --> 00:54:27.809
Hell-- That's '98 Krug in the car.
but it's not open. We've yet to pop it.

905
00:54:27.893 --> 00:54:29.937
Okay. Sir. I'm gonna have to ask you
to step out of the car.

906
00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.438
Your lady friend can stay seated.

907
00:54:31.522 --> 00:54:33.357
This is like three times this week.

908
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.068
You're very funny.
I'm charmed that you said that though.

909
00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:37.945
I mean. it's kinda flattering.

910
00:54:38.028 --> 00:54:40.405
But she's not exactly my lady friend.

911
00:54:40.489 --> 00:54:43.659
This is my daughter. Laura.
Who's your guy over here?

912
00:54:43.742 --> 00:54:44.743
That's Chris.

913
00:54:44.826 --> 00:54:47.037
Chris. my daughter Laura. How you doing?

914
00:54:47.621 --> 00:54:50.290
Laura. This is Officer...

915
00:54:52.084 --> 00:54:53.961
Are you Tommy O'Callaghan's kid?

916
00:54:55.546 --> 00:54:56.588
Sir?

917
00:54:56.672 --> 00:54:57.840
Is Tommy your pop?

918
00:54:58.549 --> 00:55:00.300
Tom. yes. that's my dad.

919
00:55:01.969 --> 00:55:04.930
Well. we go way back. I'm gonna call him.

920
00:55:05.013 --> 00:55:06.974
No. no. no.
Sir. please put the phone away.

921
00:55:07.516 --> 00:55:08.851
It's late. It's late.

922
00:55:08.934 --> 00:55:11.728
Yeah. it's late. I don't think my mom
would appreciate a phone call right now.

923
00:55:11.812 --> 00:55:14.398
That's right. She would brain him. not me.

924
00:55:14.481 --> 00:55:15.983
Yeah.

925
00:55:16.066 --> 00:55:18.485
Well. I know your pop. That was a guy.

926
00:55:19.027 --> 00:55:22.865
I went to Sergeant O'Callaghan. Timmy--

927
00:55:22.948 --> 00:55:25.075
I went to his beefsteak
for his retirement.

928
00:55:25.158 --> 00:55:27.786
and I don't know how we got home.
to be honest with you.

929
00:55:28.495 --> 00:55:29.580
That's my grandfather.

930
00:55:29.663 --> 00:55:30.998
That's right. That is correct.

931
00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:32.791
Gosh. I don't know why
I didn't make you right away.

932
00:55:32.875 --> 00:55:35.169
You are a ringer. Dead ringer.

933
00:55:35.252 --> 00:55:37.796
-Thank you.
-The eyes. Oh. my God.

934
00:55:39.339 --> 00:55:41.800
So. you still going upstate?
Going to the Adirondacks. what?

935
00:55:41.884 --> 00:55:43.510
We-- Well. when we can.

936
00:55:43.594 --> 00:55:44.636
Yeah?

937
00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.305
And you got kids of your own?

938
00:55:46.972 --> 00:55:49.266
-We're trying. Yeah.
-Attaboy. Attaboy.

939
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:50.976
It's the trying
that's so much fun. isn't it?

940
00:55:51.059 --> 00:55:52.060
Yeah. isn't it?

941
00:55:53.061 --> 00:55:54.938
Well. it's good to see ya. man.
Really good to see ya.

942
00:55:55.022 --> 00:55:56.523
Nice to meet you. sir.
Good to meet you.

943
00:55:56.607 --> 00:55:58.400
And actually.
we could get you on your way.

944
00:55:58.483 --> 00:56:00.444
if you could be a little more careful
from now on. please.

945
00:56:00.527 --> 00:56:02.613
No. I was being careful.
that's why I ran the light.

946
00:56:02.696 --> 00:56:04.823
'cause I didn't wanna get stuck
in the intersection.

947
00:56:04.907 --> 00:56:05.741
That's all right.

948
00:56:05.824 --> 00:56:07.284
Hey. I need a little manpower.

949
00:56:07.367 --> 00:56:09.745
We need some beef. You only gotta
get it going about ten miles an hour.

950
00:56:09.828 --> 00:56:10.829
Okay.

951
00:56:10.913 --> 00:56:13.081
-It'll pop pretty easily in second.
-We're just gonna give him a push.

952
00:56:13.165 --> 00:56:14.374
I'll just pop it.

953
00:56:14.917 --> 00:56:16.710
-Thanks. Let me get the keys in.
-You in?

954
00:56:16.793 --> 00:56:17.961
Yeah. I'm in. Thanks.

955
00:56:19.338 --> 00:56:21.965
It must be very nice to be you.

956
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:24.927
I wouldn't have it any other way.

957
00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:27.429
All right. On your mark. Get set. Go.

958
00:56:33.268 --> 00:56:36.146
New York's finest! Thanks. fellas.

959
00:57:00.546 --> 00:57:01.547
Felix?

960
00:57:03.423 --> 00:57:04.591
Hey.

961
00:57:07.427 --> 00:57:09.221
Wow. you look great.

962
00:57:09.304 --> 00:57:10.722
You look better.

963
00:57:11.932 --> 00:57:13.934
Yeah? Well. I'm with my daughter.

964
00:57:16.186 --> 00:57:17.479
Hi.

965
00:57:17.563 --> 00:57:18.564
Hey.

966
00:57:20.691 --> 00:57:23.026
I may be ready to sell the Hockney.

967
00:57:23.819 --> 00:57:25.445
You know how to get to me.

968
00:57:26.822 --> 00:57:28.198
You know where to call me.

969
00:57:28.282 --> 00:57:29.700
I keep funny hours.

970
00:57:31.243 --> 00:57:32.369
I remember.

971
00:57:42.296 --> 00:57:43.422
It's a client.

972
00:57:52.222 --> 00:57:53.807
I think I'm going deaf.

973
00:57:55.434 --> 00:57:56.435
Really?

974
00:57:57.561 --> 00:58:01.940
I can hear everything fine.
except women's voices.

975
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.819
You can't go deaf just to women.

976
00:58:07.738 --> 00:58:08.989
It's the pitch.

977
00:58:14.036 --> 00:58:15.829
We're making some good progress.

978
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.332
This is pathetic.

979
00:58:20.042 --> 00:58:22.169
We just need to get some more information.

980
00:58:24.254 --> 00:58:26.924
Maybe he's just not
interested in me anymore.

981
00:58:29.801 --> 00:58:30.844
Impossible.

982
00:58:32.846 --> 00:58:33.889
Thanks.

983
00:58:46.985 --> 00:58:48.820
You're gonna be all right. shorty.

984
00:59:28.861 --> 00:59:30.737
Turns out he was married.

985
00:59:31.196 --> 00:59:32.281
I'm so sorry.

986
00:59:33.407 --> 00:59:37.995
I know. It's such a strange bummer.

987
00:59:39.079 --> 00:59:43.876
And you know what?
Like. I have things to do.

988
00:59:44.585 --> 00:59:46.795
You know what I mean? I don't really
have time for other people's baggage.

989
00:59:46.879 --> 00:59:48.964
I'm sort of like. "Okay."

990
00:59:49.339 --> 00:59:53.218
Like. get on down the road if that's
sort of what you're gonna be like.

991
00:59:53.302 --> 00:59:55.137
-especially in our community.
-Sure. Sure.

992
00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:56.221
Which I think is like...

993
00:59:56.305 --> 00:59:58.765
Okay. I mean. he's basically
walking around with. like. a mask on.

994
00:59:58.849 --> 01:00:01.977
whereas I'm. like. so... open.

995
01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:06.690
-Yeah.
-I'm just. like. bare. Like. I'm naked.

996
01:00:07.733 --> 01:00:10.736
And I was--
You know. I was there with him naked.

997
01:00:10.819 --> 01:00:13.447
You would think two people naked together.
like. one of them might say.

998
01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:16.325
"By the way. like.
I have a wife and a family.

999
01:00:16.408 --> 01:00:19.119
and we own a home together. and we.
like. all sleep in the same house

1000
01:00:19.203 --> 01:00:20.954
and use the same bathrooms. and we...

1001
01:00:21.038 --> 01:00:24.458
have a family. and you're not in it
because you're not even my girlfriend.

1002
01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:25.918
Because I have a wife."

1003
01:00:27.544 --> 01:00:29.296
Okay. what's so important?

1004
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:33.383
Well. it's just a start.

1005
01:00:37.137 --> 01:00:38.889
Oh. my God.

1006
01:00:38.972 --> 01:00:40.140
What...

1007
01:00:40.224 --> 01:00:41.975
-This is nothing.
-Laura.

1008
01:00:42.059 --> 01:00:47.481
My God. What if what we find out is
that Dean's just busy. and I'm in a rut?

1009
01:00:47.564 --> 01:00:48.565
That's it.

1010
01:00:49.233 --> 01:00:51.276
God. I regret telling you anything.

1011
01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:54.071
I talked to my man at Bones.

1012
01:00:54.154 --> 01:00:58.367
Bones--
No. enough with the spy scenarios. okay?

1013
01:00:59.368 --> 01:01:04.540
Did you really call me in here to show me
pictures of my husband eating a sandwich?

1014
01:01:04.623 --> 01:01:07.960
There's more. We put a hotwatch on him.

1015
01:01:10.212 --> 01:01:11.296
What's a hotwatch?

1016
01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:15.133
They track his credit cards
and his whereabouts.

1017
01:01:15.634 --> 01:01:17.052
Okay. and?

1018
01:01:22.516 --> 01:01:24.935
May be nothing. but...

1019
01:01:26.311 --> 01:01:27.354
What?

1020
01:01:32.943 --> 01:01:34.736
He booked a trip to Manzanillo.

1021
01:01:36.238 --> 01:01:38.156
You are so full of it.

1022
01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.659
He would tell me
if he was going to Mexico.

1023
01:01:42.995 --> 01:01:45.414
We need to gather and evaluate.

1024
01:01:46.456 --> 01:01:47.666
I have to get going.

1025
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:50.752
Wait. I can drop you. Quick stop.

1026
01:01:51.378 --> 01:01:53.755
-No. I--
-Mrs. Morris at the Sherry. It's her 90th.

1027
01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:55.215
I have to get home.

1028
01:01:55.299 --> 01:01:57.509
Fast elevators. and she's got a Twombly.

1029
01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:05.601
She did the Venice Biennale.

1030
01:02:06.185 --> 01:02:09.396
With Storm King.
she's doing something so beautiful.

1031
01:02:10.022 --> 01:02:15.027
It's beyond description.
It's a crescent. It's called Fallen Sky.

1032
01:02:15.444 --> 01:02:19.031
Made of stainless steel.
and you have the reflection.

1033
01:02:19.114 --> 01:02:22.993
And at Storm King. you know.
all these grotesque big things...

1034
01:02:24.161 --> 01:02:25.829
Are you Felix's daughter?

1035
01:02:26.163 --> 01:02:27.581
Yes. I'm Laura.

1036
01:02:27.998 --> 01:02:29.416
You live in the city?

1037
01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:30.501
I do.

1038
01:02:30.959 --> 01:02:32.294
Are you married?

1039
01:02:33.128 --> 01:02:34.254
Yes. I am.

1040
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:35.797
How is it?

1041
01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:40.135
Honestly. I'm not sure right now.

1042
01:02:40.719 --> 01:02:43.138
And that was very entertaining.

1043
01:02:43.222 --> 01:02:49.228
She makes rocks. huge ones. small ones.
but they're as light as a feather.

1044
01:02:50.896 --> 01:02:54.566
You know what I think?
Marriage is like a bank account.

1045
01:02:55.359 --> 01:02:57.903
You make deposits
for the first 20 or 30 years.

1046
01:02:57.986 --> 01:03:02.366
and then. after that.
you have all this interest built up.

1047
01:03:02.449 --> 01:03:05.202
and you can start making withdrawals.

1048
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:10.249
And... I don't forget costumes.

1049
01:03:17.256 --> 01:03:18.340
So nice to meet you.

1050
01:03:19.299 --> 01:03:20.384
Same here.

1051
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:28.225
I'm dying for that Twombly.

1052
01:03:29.768 --> 01:03:32.521
She looks pretty healthy to me.
She might make it to 100.

1053
01:03:33.564 --> 01:03:35.899
All right.
Don't get my blood pressure up. shorty.

1054
01:03:35.983 --> 01:03:37.776
All right.
I wanna show you something special.

1055
01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:40.696
But you have to walk backwards
so no one knows we're leaving.

1056
01:03:52.749 --> 01:03:54.293
Where are we going?

1057
01:03:54.376 --> 01:03:55.669
Hey! Where are we--

1058
01:04:09.433 --> 01:04:10.976
That's something. isn't it?

1059
01:04:11.852 --> 01:04:12.978
Beautiful.

1060
01:04:16.315 --> 01:04:19.109
I remember the first time I saw them
at the Tuileries.

1061
01:04:21.111 --> 01:04:24.656
The next day. your mom and I
drove out to the gardens at Giverny.

1062
01:05:46.154 --> 01:05:47.239
-Hey.
-Hey.

1063
01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.742
How's writing going?

1064
01:05:52.202 --> 01:05:55.789
I wish I had something exciting to report.

1065
01:05:55.873 --> 01:05:58.834
I just-- I'm so stuck.

1066
01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:01.670
I keep telling you...

1067
01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.965
you have to make more time for yourself.

1068
01:06:05.757 --> 01:06:08.927
Yeah. right. Like... take a trip.

1069
01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:10.512
-Yeah.
-By myself.

1070
01:06:12.014 --> 01:06:13.557
I forgot to tell you.

1071
01:06:14.057 --> 01:06:16.226
I got invited to a conference
down in Mexico.

1072
01:06:17.186 --> 01:06:19.646
It's kinda last minute.
but it's a really big deal.

1073
01:06:22.191 --> 01:06:23.442
Who's going?

1074
01:06:24.234 --> 01:06:26.987
Just the team. you know.
Me. John. Fifi. Rog--

1075
01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:28.071
Fiona?

1076
01:06:28.989 --> 01:06:30.282
Yeah. Fifi.

1077
01:06:31.825 --> 01:06:32.826
Right.

1078
01:06:38.415 --> 01:06:41.627
All right. I'm going to bed.

1079
01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:44.171
Love you.

1080
01:06:48.383 --> 01:06:51.929
Your Bones man was right.
They're headed to Mexico.

1081
01:06:52.304 --> 01:06:53.305
I told you.

1082
01:06:53.388 --> 01:06:55.516
All right. pack your bags. Call a sitter.

1083
01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:57.017
I'll arrange everything else.

1084
01:06:57.768 --> 01:07:02.231
Are you crazy? I'm not gonna leave
my kids for a few days with a babysitter.

1085
01:07:02.648 --> 01:07:03.857
Call your mother.

1086
01:07:04.358 --> 01:07:05.984
We're not just gonna hop--

1087
01:07:06.443 --> 01:07:07.444
You know what?

1088
01:07:07.528 --> 01:07:09.780
I'm just gonna talk to him.
I'm just gonna talk to him.

1089
01:07:09.863 --> 01:07:11.323
I don't advise that.

1090
01:07:11.865 --> 01:07:14.409
Look. you need to get ahead of this thing.

1091
01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:16.995
It's only a few hours away.

1092
01:07:17.704 --> 01:07:21.834
My friend's condo.
at the resort next door. is available.

1093
01:07:21.917 --> 01:07:23.585
Got its own private entrance.

1094
01:07:23.669 --> 01:07:25.838
And you deserve a little vacation.

1095
01:07:25.921 --> 01:07:27.256
No way.

1096
01:07:27.339 --> 01:07:28.674
Pack light.

1097
01:07:37.057 --> 01:07:39.184
I got a map of the properties
from my travel agent.

1098
01:07:39.268 --> 01:07:41.103
Who has a travel agent anymore?

1099
01:07:41.186 --> 01:07:43.730
Their group is staying
at this place right over here.

1100
01:07:44.231 --> 01:07:47.150
What do you say
we meet at the bar in. say. 45?

1101
01:08:33.988 --> 01:08:37.117
Mexicali Rose

1102
01:08:37.492 --> 01:08:41.287
Stop crying

1103
01:08:42.163 --> 01:08:45.501
I'll come back to you

1104
01:08:45.584 --> 01:08:49.171
Some sunny day

1105
01:08:50.046 --> 01:08:53.800
You know every night

1106
01:08:53.884 --> 01:08:57.888
That I'll be pining

1107
01:08:58.971 --> 01:09:05.145
Every hour the year that I'm away

1108
01:09:07.397 --> 01:09:11.234
Dry those big brown eyes

1109
01:09:11.818 --> 01:09:15.113
And smile. dear

1110
01:09:16.406 --> 01:09:22.996
Banish all those tears
And please don't sigh

1111
01:09:24.247 --> 01:09:27.626
Kiss me once again

1112
01:09:28.335 --> 01:09:33.048
And hold me

1113
01:09:34.758 --> 01:09:41.723
Mexicali Rose

1114
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:51.524
Goodbye

1115
01:10:01.243 --> 01:10:03.996
-Gabi. Laura. Laura. Gabi.
-Hi.

1116
01:10:04.079 --> 01:10:05.664
-My yoga instructor.
-Hi.

1117
01:10:05.747 --> 01:10:07.124
-Charro.
-Hi.

1118
01:10:07.207 --> 01:10:09.293
-Alejandro. Juan.
-Hi.

1119
01:10:09.835 --> 01:10:10.961
This fella I didn't meet.

1120
01:10:11.044 --> 01:10:14.339
Do you really have to make such
a big entrance everywhere you go?

1121
01:10:14.423 --> 01:10:15.674
That was an exit.

1122
01:10:15.757 --> 01:10:17.634
But if I do go missing.
check the yoga studio.

1123
01:10:17.718 --> 01:10:18.927
Just don't break anything.

1124
01:10:19.011 --> 01:10:20.262
-Hi.
-Hey.

1125
01:10:20.345 --> 01:10:21.346
Carla.

1126
01:10:22.681 --> 01:10:24.391
-Carla. This is her place.
-Welcome.

1127
01:10:24.474 --> 01:10:25.851
It's so nice.

1128
01:10:25.934 --> 01:10:26.935
Enjoy it.

1129
01:10:27.603 --> 01:10:29.855
-And I'll think about the Hockney.
-Thank you.

1130
01:10:30.397 --> 01:10:33.108
Wait. Is that why we're here?
Because you're making a deal?

1131
01:10:33.192 --> 01:10:35.235
No. We're here 'cause we're here.

1132
01:10:35.319 --> 01:10:36.361
She just might be someone

1133
01:10:36.445 --> 01:10:38.989
who could be interested
in a very expensive piece of art.

1134
01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.411
I can't believe I'm here.

1135
01:10:45.537 --> 01:10:47.539
It's beautiful. Isn't it?

1136
01:10:48.665 --> 01:10:49.666
It is.

1137
01:10:54.796 --> 01:10:57.716
Do you know there's a cult up in Canada

1138
01:10:58.425 --> 01:11:00.928
where women kidnap innocent men.

1139
01:11:01.428 --> 01:11:04.431
and if they try to escape or resist
in any way.

1140
01:11:05.224 --> 01:11:07.768
the women placate them with sex.

1141
01:11:08.185 --> 01:11:09.728
It sounds like your fantasy.

1142
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:11.730
It's not unlike the bonobos.

1143
01:11:12.689 --> 01:11:14.816
-You know who they are.
-The monkeys?

1144
01:11:15.442 --> 01:11:19.112
Only mammals
where the females dominate the males.

1145
01:11:21.907 --> 01:11:25.160
Why is it that when a woman has an affair.

1146
01:11:25.244 --> 01:11:28.372
it's so wonderful that she found someone?

1147
01:11:28.455 --> 01:11:32.209
But if a man has an affair.
he's banging his secretary?

1148
01:11:34.336 --> 01:11:35.462
Why did you do it?

1149
01:11:44.471 --> 01:11:48.350
When your mom and I were first together.
she was so amazing.

1150
01:11:48.433 --> 01:11:51.436
I mean. she shone all her light on me.

1151
01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:56.233
But when you guys came along.
all that light went to you two.

1152
01:11:57.401 --> 01:12:00.279
And when someone
looked at me again like that...

1153
01:12:02.573 --> 01:12:04.491
you know. I wanted that glow again.

1154
01:12:05.868 --> 01:12:07.619
You're such a baby.

1155
01:12:10.455 --> 01:12:12.457
We all just want to be loved.

1156
01:12:12.958 --> 01:12:14.251
It's exhausting.

1157
01:12:16.628 --> 01:12:17.629
Why?

1158
01:12:19.006 --> 01:12:21.842
It's exhausting to try to love you enough.

1159
01:12:24.219 --> 01:12:28.432
Your mother had all these things
she wanted to do all of a sudden.

1160
01:12:28.515 --> 01:12:30.517
And all her friends.

1161
01:12:30.601 --> 01:12:31.685
And she had you kids.

1162
01:12:32.352 --> 01:12:35.522
You know. when Holly came along
and was so crazy about me.

1163
01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:37.858
I wasn't used to it.

1164
01:12:37.941 --> 01:12:40.068
So that's all it took?

1165
01:12:40.152 --> 01:12:44.489
That was the appeal? That she just
looked at you with such adoration?

1166
01:12:45.574 --> 01:12:49.536
Yeah. and your mom
didn't wanna travel with me anymore.

1167
01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.122
I needed to travel. She wouldn't go.

1168
01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:54.499
She suggested I take Holly.

1169
01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:56.293
Holly had just started at the gallery.

1170
01:12:59.129 --> 01:13:00.964
Did you know that she died this year?

1171
01:13:04.676 --> 01:13:06.428
-No.
-She died.

1172
01:13:08.889 --> 01:13:10.891
I never thought I'd outlive her.

1173
01:13:13.268 --> 01:13:14.478
She was only...

1174
01:13:15.437 --> 01:13:16.438
50.

1175
01:13:17.898 --> 01:13:19.858
I don't really remember her.

1176
01:13:21.652 --> 01:13:22.861
She was funny...

1177
01:13:25.322 --> 01:13:26.615
and very smart...

1178
01:13:29.576 --> 01:13:31.453
and a terrifically talented painter.

1179
01:13:39.294 --> 01:13:40.963
I never got to say goodbye to her.

1180
01:13:42.923 --> 01:13:46.051
After everything you put us through.
what it did to Mom.

1181
01:13:46.969 --> 01:13:49.054
and then you didn't even stay with Holly.

1182
01:13:50.097 --> 01:13:51.431
Was it worth it?

1183
01:13:56.603 --> 01:13:57.771
It was heartbreaking...

1184
01:13:59.815 --> 01:14:00.983
for everyone.

1185
01:14:21.003 --> 01:14:22.171
Do you know where we are?

1186
01:14:22.254 --> 01:14:24.423
All right.
We're gonna cut between these two.

1187
01:14:26.341 --> 01:14:28.468
Come here.
Move it. Move it. Move it.

1188
01:14:28.552 --> 01:14:29.636
Dig. dig.

1189
01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.930
-Get down. Get down. Get down.
-Okay. okay! All right!

1190
01:14:32.014 --> 01:14:34.892
No. Too late.
Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.

1191
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:36.768
-Put your arms around me.
-What?

1192
01:14:38.437 --> 01:14:39.438
Gross.

1193
01:14:40.981 --> 01:14:44.067
Yuck. That is truly a new low.

1194
01:14:44.943 --> 01:14:47.321
Hey. you're welcome. It was effective.

1195
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:49.072
This is wartime.

1196
01:14:49.406 --> 01:14:50.449
Where are we going?

1197
01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:54.286
Mr. Wonderful's room is right over there.

1198
01:14:54.369 --> 01:14:55.370
You sure?

1199
01:14:55.454 --> 01:14:58.165
If you can hold
some of this... here.

1200
01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:00.667
Can hold these.

1201
01:15:02.169 --> 01:15:03.420
Don't crush those.

1202
01:15:08.592 --> 01:15:10.093
-You okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

1203
01:15:10.177 --> 01:15:12.012
Can you hold these. please?

1204
01:15:12.095 --> 01:15:13.096
Yeah.

1205
01:15:18.477 --> 01:15:19.478
Where now?

1206
01:15:22.689 --> 01:15:23.815
Are you okay?

1207
01:15:23.899 --> 01:15:25.400
I'm doing great. I'm on fire.

1208
01:15:25.484 --> 01:15:26.485
Let's go.

1209
01:15:29.988 --> 01:15:33.367
I never got the point of infinity pools.

1210
01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:35.619
Where the hell is the edge?
You don't even know.

1211
01:15:35.702 --> 01:15:37.746
The damn thing makes me afraid

1212
01:15:37.829 --> 01:15:40.666
that I'm gonna fall off
into some canyon or something.

1213
01:15:41.124 --> 01:15:42.209
Just--

1214
01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:44.962
-Wait a second.
-What? What do you see?

1215
01:15:46.004 --> 01:15:47.381
There's a woman in the room.

1216
01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:50.759
What? You sure?

1217
01:15:52.469 --> 01:15:53.470
I'm sure.

1218
01:15:59.643 --> 01:16:02.020
-Hey. Where you going?
-I can't believe this.

1219
01:16:02.104 --> 01:16:03.355
Wait. Wait!

1220
01:16:03.438 --> 01:16:05.148
I'm ending this shit right now.

1221
01:16:05.232 --> 01:16:06.441
Wait. Don't do that.

1222
01:16:06.525 --> 01:16:07.818
-Where is he?
-Wait up.

1223
01:16:08.527 --> 01:16:09.570
Wait up. Wait up.

1224
01:16:11.822 --> 01:16:13.991
Just a second. This is a bad idea.

1225
01:16:14.074 --> 01:16:15.659
This is your bad idea.

1226
01:16:16.827 --> 01:16:18.412
And that's bad too. Silence that.

1227
01:16:18.495 --> 01:16:20.163
-You silence it. It's not mine.
-Shut it up.

1228
01:16:20.247 --> 01:16:22.165
-It's not mine. It's not my ring.
-It's not--

1229
01:16:22.249 --> 01:16:26.128
It's my ring. but you-- you have my phone.
Where's my phone? Where is it?

1230
01:16:26.211 --> 01:16:28.005
-Grabbing isn't helping.
-Where is it?

1231
01:16:29.298 --> 01:16:30.632
Where's my phone?

1232
01:16:35.095 --> 01:16:37.222
Give it to me. Come on! Give it--

1233
01:16:38.223 --> 01:16:39.725
-No. Dad.
-It's for you.

1234
01:16:39.808 --> 01:16:41.852
It's for you. I wanna talk to this guy.

1235
01:16:44.855 --> 01:16:45.856
Laura?

1236
01:16:46.982 --> 01:16:49.067
Oh. my God! What--

1237
01:16:50.068 --> 01:16:51.862
Fiona? What--

1238
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:56.241
Do you need to get that?

1239
01:16:58.327 --> 01:16:59.995
One... second.

1240
01:17:00.078 --> 01:17:01.788
-Hey.
-Hey. What's up?

1241
01:17:02.581 --> 01:17:04.750
How you doing. baby? Guess what?

1242
01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:07.711
I'm coming home.

1243
01:17:07.794 --> 01:17:09.880
I got done early.
so I caught a flight home.

1244
01:17:09.963 --> 01:17:11.882
-I'm on my way.
-What? When?

1245
01:17:12.299 --> 01:17:13.926
I should be there in a half hour.

1246
01:17:14.259 --> 01:17:16.762
So. you wanna order some Chinese?

1247
01:17:17.304 --> 01:17:19.056
Maybe crack a bottle of wine?

1248
01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.601
Well. I'm not home. My mom is with them.

1249
01:17:23.227 --> 01:17:24.353
So...

1250
01:17:24.436 --> 01:17:25.437
Where are you?

1251
01:17:26.355 --> 01:17:28.148
Well. I can't wait to see you.

1252
01:17:28.232 --> 01:17:30.192
-I love you. See you soon.
-I'll call you later.

1253
01:17:30.275 --> 01:17:32.069
Were you trying to surprise Dean?

1254
01:17:32.486 --> 01:17:33.487
Sort of. yeah.

1255
01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:35.572
That's so romantic.

1256
01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:40.035
-Hi.
-Hi.

1257
01:17:41.245 --> 01:17:42.246
Oh. gosh.

1258
01:17:44.039 --> 01:17:45.457
Is he with you?

1259
01:17:49.586 --> 01:17:51.672
Yes. That's my dad.

1260
01:17:52.256 --> 01:17:53.465
Come say hi. Dad.

1261
01:17:53.549 --> 01:17:54.591
Hi.

1262
01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:56.051
Felix Keane.

1263
01:17:56.134 --> 01:17:58.554
Fiona Saunders. Nice to meet you.

1264
01:17:58.971 --> 01:18:00.138
And this is my friend Mandy.

1265
01:18:00.889 --> 01:18:02.057
-Hi.
-Hi.

1266
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:04.852
So. Dean gave us his room.

1267
01:18:04.935 --> 01:18:07.187
It's so nice. the ocean view. and just...

1268
01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.398
Do you wanna come in and have a drink?

1269
01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:11.483
-One drink.
-That's very nice. but no. No.

1270
01:18:11.567 --> 01:18:13.068
We're-- Thank you.

1271
01:18:13.151 --> 01:18:14.695
Thank you. No. we're gonna go.

1272
01:18:14.778 --> 01:18:16.113
-Okay.
-Good to see you.

1273
01:18:16.905 --> 01:18:17.948
Bye.

1274
01:18:40.929 --> 01:18:42.806
You can slow down. There's a storm coming.

1275
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:45.267
I know. I just gotta get outta here.

1276
01:18:45.809 --> 01:18:47.227
How could you bring me here?

1277
01:18:48.395 --> 01:18:49.980
Hey. I'm on your side.

1278
01:18:50.063 --> 01:18:54.067
I was such an idiot to let you
convince me to come here.

1279
01:18:54.943 --> 01:18:58.238
You blew your own marriage.
and now you're gonna mess up mine?

1280
01:18:58.322 --> 01:19:00.032
Can you let anybody be happy?

1281
01:19:00.616 --> 01:19:02.743
You are so selfish.

1282
01:19:05.746 --> 01:19:07.497
You can say it to my face now.

1283
01:19:08.207 --> 01:19:09.333
I will.

1284
01:19:10.626 --> 01:19:15.214
I am sick of you taking over everything.

1285
01:19:15.881 --> 01:19:18.842
making it all about you
and what you want all the time.

1286
01:19:20.177 --> 01:19:21.929
What you dragged us all through.

1287
01:19:22.012 --> 01:19:23.597
You pushed Mom away.

1288
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:29.228
You can't go deaf to women's voices.
You know that. right?

1289
01:19:30.562 --> 01:19:32.439
You have daughters and granddaughters.

1290
01:19:32.523 --> 01:19:34.942
so you better start figuring out
how to hear them.

1291
01:19:36.109 --> 01:19:37.236
You pushed Mom away.

1292
01:19:38.362 --> 01:19:39.821
You wanna push us away too?

1293
01:19:40.948 --> 01:19:43.200
It's shocking that as your daughter.

1294
01:19:43.283 --> 01:19:47.120
I'm capable of having
any kind of relationship at all

1295
01:19:47.204 --> 01:19:49.456
with anybody. with anyone respectful.

1296
01:19:50.582 --> 01:19:52.084
You weren't even discreet.

1297
01:19:53.001 --> 01:19:56.880
You couldn't even just be discreet
out of respect for Mom?

1298
01:19:57.923 --> 01:19:58.924
And me?

1299
01:19:59.758 --> 01:20:04.221
Do you know what it's like
to have to keep all of your secrets?

1300
01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:08.141
Stupid theories.

1301
01:20:08.851 --> 01:20:11.728
You are not an animal
with no self-control.

1302
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:14.648
You can control your own behavior.

1303
01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.988
And can you be around a woman
without hitting on her?

1304
01:20:22.197 --> 01:20:24.074
Because it's starting to get pathetic.

1305
01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.579
What happened to you?

1306
01:20:30.122 --> 01:20:31.456
You used to be fun.

1307
01:20:43.802 --> 01:20:47.139
Maybe something changed.
Can you please check? Any flight.

1308
01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:49.141
Tomorrow morning?

1309
01:20:50.475 --> 01:20:51.476
Please.

1310
01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:54.021
I'm sorry. ma'am.
Those flights have been canceled.

1311
01:20:54.104 --> 01:20:55.731
You can try going on standby.

1312
01:22:02.256 --> 01:22:06.134
Ladies and gentlemen.
please check updated flight information

1313
01:22:06.218 --> 01:22:08.971
because there are
multiple delays and cancellations.

1314
01:22:09.054 --> 01:22:10.222
Thank you.

1315
01:22:24.778 --> 01:22:25.863
Hi.

1316
01:22:25.946 --> 01:22:27.072
-Mommy!
-Mama!

1317
01:22:27.573 --> 01:22:28.740
Hi!

1318
01:22:29.533 --> 01:22:30.826
-You made it.
-Thanks. Mom.

1319
01:22:34.079 --> 01:22:36.164
Come on. girls. No. no. Let's go to bed.

1320
01:22:36.248 --> 01:22:37.875
I don't wanna go to bed.

1321
01:22:47.301 --> 01:22:48.844
Can we talk outside?

1322
01:23:09.948 --> 01:23:10.949
All right.

1323
01:23:11.575 --> 01:23:13.994
What are you thinking? What was that?

1324
01:23:15.329 --> 01:23:16.330
My dad...

1325
01:23:17.539 --> 01:23:19.791
You know. one of his crazy ideas.

1326
01:23:21.001 --> 01:23:24.129
He thought it was a good idea
to follow you to Mexico...

1327
01:23:25.589 --> 01:23:29.843
and if something was going on.
I could get ahead of it.

1328
01:23:29.927 --> 01:23:32.679
-Why didn't you just ask me?
-I don't-- I don't know.

1329
01:23:32.763 --> 01:23:35.224
I know I should have. I should have.

1330
01:23:36.266 --> 01:23:37.476
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry.

1331
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:39.853
I just...

1332
01:23:42.731 --> 01:23:45.526
I'm just not myself right now. and...

1333
01:23:47.027 --> 01:23:48.529
I can't write.

1334
01:23:49.154 --> 01:23:52.491
and I just feel like
you're not that into me.

1335
01:23:52.574 --> 01:23:55.577
-Babe--
-And I... feel so boring.

1336
01:23:56.036 --> 01:23:58.372
Hey. You are not boring.

1337
01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:03.752
Okay. Maybe a little bit.

1338
01:24:07.297 --> 01:24:09.174
I don't wanna be with anybody else.

1339
01:24:09.258 --> 01:24:12.553
But it seems like you were
everywhere else except with me.

1340
01:24:12.636 --> 01:24:13.637
I was working.

1341
01:24:16.515 --> 01:24:18.892
All right. You know what? I'm sorry.

1342
01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:23.313
I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I did anything
to make you feel that way.

1343
01:24:23.397 --> 01:24:25.524
And I'm sorry I haven't been around more.

1344
01:24:26.733 --> 01:24:28.694
I'm just trying to
make this company successful.

1345
01:24:28.777 --> 01:24:30.028
I'm trying to impress you.

1346
01:24:30.112 --> 01:24:31.738
-Impress me?
-I just--

1347
01:24:31.822 --> 01:24:33.490
You don't have to impress me.

1348
01:24:34.825 --> 01:24:36.368
I just wanna be enough for you.

1349
01:24:38.245 --> 01:24:39.413
You do?

1350
01:24:39.496 --> 01:24:41.748
-Enough for them.
-You are.

1351
01:24:42.332 --> 01:24:43.250
I'm so--

1352
01:24:44.334 --> 01:24:45.878
I'm so sorry.

1353
01:24:47.504 --> 01:24:48.630
I'm sorry.

1354
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:54.511
I'm so stupid. It was stupid.

1355
01:24:54.595 --> 01:24:55.596
Stupid as hell.

1356
01:24:58.265 --> 01:24:59.850
-I love you.
-I love you.

1357
01:25:00.684 --> 01:25:01.685
So much.

1358
01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:05.731
Let's go home.

1359
01:25:09.359 --> 01:25:11.778
I can't believe you went
all the way to Mexico.

1360
01:25:11.862 --> 01:25:13.530
Trust me. it was not a vacation.

1361
01:25:13.614 --> 01:25:15.032
You're such a stalker.

1362
01:25:55.239 --> 01:25:57.157
Do you want some pancakes?

1363
01:25:57.241 --> 01:25:58.242
No.

1364
01:25:59.576 --> 01:26:00.577
Let me sleep.

1365
01:26:18.303 --> 01:26:19.304
You got it.

1366
01:26:21.056 --> 01:26:23.934
Very nice. You're great.

1367
01:26:25.561 --> 01:26:28.230
Well. we got to the bottom of things.

1368
01:26:30.774 --> 01:26:33.277
And I may have made a few mistakes.

1369
01:26:34.319 --> 01:26:39.283
Next time just ask me
if you wanna spend some time together.

1370
01:26:40.367 --> 01:26:42.369
Okay. I do. How about this?

1371
01:26:42.452 --> 01:26:47.249
The QE2 leaves at 5:00.
You could still make it.

1372
01:26:47.332 --> 01:26:49.084
I have the Princess Margaret suite.

1373
01:26:49.168 --> 01:26:52.296
A little bit floral. but very nice.

1374
01:26:52.379 --> 01:26:54.339
All-you-can-eat. all-you-can-drink.

1375
01:26:54.423 --> 01:26:58.552
and it's a known fact that you can drink
a lot more on a ship in the open ocean.

1376
01:26:58.635 --> 01:27:00.345
We could just get aboard.

1377
01:27:00.429 --> 01:27:03.098
see how much we could handle
without falling overboard.

1378
01:27:04.892 --> 01:27:07.811
Sounds fun. but I can't.

1379
01:27:10.439 --> 01:27:12.191
You have your own adventure.

1380
01:27:19.031 --> 01:27:20.282
I'll see you soon. kiddo.

1381
01:27:32.544 --> 01:27:33.629
Bye. Dad.

1382
01:27:37.049 --> 01:27:38.175
Bye.

1383
01:27:54.733 --> 01:27:58.862
So. how's the writing going?
How many pages you do today?

1384
01:27:58.946 --> 01:28:00.781
I am on page 64.

1385
01:28:01.198 --> 01:28:02.366
Nice.

1386
01:28:02.783 --> 01:28:04.868
I just don't really know where to go next.

1387
01:28:06.119 --> 01:28:07.538
You'll get through it.

1388
01:28:07.621 --> 01:28:10.499
At least we know you could write
a really good detective story.

1389
01:28:12.543 --> 01:28:13.794
Or not so good.

1390
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:17.089
I can't believe you.

1391
01:28:18.924 --> 01:28:19.925
Here.

1392
01:28:22.302 --> 01:28:23.762
I got you a little something.

1393
01:28:24.263 --> 01:28:26.181
It's the rest of your birthday present.

1394
01:28:30.936 --> 01:28:31.937
Hope you like it.

1395
01:29:05.429 --> 01:29:08.265
Sorry. I didn't realize
how long it takes to engrave.

1396
01:29:26.617 --> 01:29:27.743
It's beautiful.

1397
01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.411
Like you.

1398
01:29:40.005 --> 01:29:41.507
It looks really nice on your wrist.

1399
01:29:52.559 --> 01:29:53.810
Looks great.

1400
01:29:53.894 --> 01:29:54.853
Love it.

1401
01:29:55.938 --> 01:29:56.939
Thank you.

1402
01:29:58.190 --> 01:29:59.650
Happy birthday. my love.

1403
01:29:59.733 --> 01:30:01.026
Thank you.
