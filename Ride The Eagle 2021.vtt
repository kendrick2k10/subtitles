3
00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:41.575
Okay. fuck it.

4
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.610
Here we go.

5
00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:48.747
Shit.

6
00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:54.929
Okay. there you go.

7
00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:57.921
Fuck.

8
00:00:57.956 --> 00:00:59.395
Oh. well.

9
00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:13.904
Hi. Leif.

10
00:02:33.524 --> 00:02:36.261
You like those so much.
don't you?

11
00:02:36.296 --> 00:02:38.461
Don't growl at me.

12
00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:39.726
I'm giving you stuff.

13
00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:44.027
Want this?

14
00:02:44.062 --> 00:02:46.029
What kind of tricks
can you do?

15
00:02:46.064 --> 00:02:48.570
Can you go around?

16
00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:50.077
Ah.

17
00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:54.675
You're too teethy. honey.

18
00:02:56.712 --> 00:02:58.052
Here.

19
00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:04.487
Leif?

20
00:03:04.522 --> 00:03:05.983
Leif. are you there?

21
00:03:07.756 --> 00:03:09.129
Leif?

22
00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:12.990
Leif!

23
00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:16.895
- Hey.
- Hi. Remember me?

24
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.502
Not really. no.

25
00:03:19.537 --> 00:03:22.505
It's Missy.
Aunt Missy. remember?

26
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.870
I was in the spiritual community
with your mother and you

27
00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:26.476
when you were a little boy.

28
00:03:26.511 --> 00:03:30.513
- Okay.
- Wow. you got old.

29
00:03:30.548 --> 00:03:32.284
You know what?
Give me a second. Missy.

30
00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.551
- Let me put a shirt on.
- I like your overalls.

31
00:03:42.362 --> 00:03:45.594
So. uh.
what can I do for you?

32
00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.530
I wanted to let you know.

33
00:03:47.565 --> 00:03:49.532
I wanted to tell you
in person.

34
00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:53.096
and I just. uh. wanted to.

35
00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:56.539
more than anything. uh...

36
00:03:56.574 --> 00:03:58.145
your mom died.

37
00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.346
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:10.753 --> 00:04:12.489
All right. I'll come down.

39
00:04:14.427 --> 00:04:16.922
She had cancer.
Found it too late

40
00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:20.563
and didn't get any treatment.
No chemo. nothing.

41
00:04:20.598 --> 00:04:23.566
- Oh.
- You know your mom with doctors and stuff.

42
00:04:23.601 --> 00:04:24.831
It just wasn't her thing.

43
00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:28.934
I do have some good news
for you. though.

44
00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.738
She left you her cabin.

45
00:04:30.773 --> 00:04:31.937
She left the cabin for me?

46
00:04:31.972 --> 00:04:33.576
- She did. she did.
- No way.

47
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:35.776
Uh-huh.
But there is a catch.

48
00:04:35.811 --> 00:04:37.481
She felt like
there were some things

49
00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:39.142
she still needed
to teach you.

50
00:04:39.177 --> 00:04:40.484
but couldn't
get ahold of you.

51
00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:44.323
so she did this.

52
00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:46.952
A conditional inheritance.

53
00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:51.759
"I. Suzanne 'Honey' Reinhold
hereby leave my cabin to my son

54
00:04:51.794 --> 00:04:56.335
Leif Reinhold provided
he completes this list of tasks

55
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.667
left for him at the cabin.

56
00:04:58.702 --> 00:05:01.670
Should he not complete the list.
the cabin will be sold

57
00:05:01.705 --> 00:05:05.773
and proceeds donated to the Theodore Payne
Foundation for Wildflowers and Native..."

58
00:05:05.808 --> 00:05:07.346
So there's a list
at the cabin?

59
00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:10.481
Yes. yes.
And if you don't do those things...

60
00:05:10.516 --> 00:05:13.176
- Yeah.
- ...you will not get the cabin.

61
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:15.178
- And this is legal?
- Yeah. it is.

62
00:05:15.213 --> 00:05:17.015
- Unfortunately. you have...
- Okay.

63
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.116
Hey. uh. do you know
what's on the list?

64
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:21.789
No. I have no idea
what's on this list.

65
00:05:21.824 --> 00:05:23.989
But knowing Honey.
it's gonna be wild.

66
00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:25.298
I can guarantee that.

67
00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:27.795
Right. That makes sense.
That makes sense.

68
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.633
Do you own a gun?

69
00:05:30.668 --> 00:05:35.671
- No. Should I?
- No. You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

70
00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:40.841
So. Honey's dead.

71
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.174
Weird. right?

72
00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:48.486
Yeah. Don't feel bad.
You didn't know her.

73
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:54.426
I didn't really know her
either. to be honest.

74
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:57.220
So sad she's dead
though. right?

75
00:05:57.255 --> 00:05:58.496
Do you feel sad?

76
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.226
Sometimes I feel
like you understand

77
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:05.228
every single thing
I'm saying.

78
00:06:05.263 --> 00:06:08.704
and other times I just
think you have dog brains.

79
00:06:11.313 --> 00:06:13.478
All right. fuck it.
Let's do it.

80
00:06:15.207 --> 00:06:17.845
What do we have to lose. right?
A weird week?

81
00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:31.364
Gorka?

82
00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:36.501
Stop banging on my window!

83
00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:40.307
Gorka?

84
00:06:42.036 --> 00:06:43.310
Gork.

85
00:06:51.452 --> 00:06:54.178
- I need to talk to you.
- What do you need. Leif?

86
00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:56.554
It's about the band and
my schedule. It's important.

87
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:59.656
Ugh. Not now. I'm busy.

88
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:02.054
- You're not busy.
- How do you know?

89
00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:05.365
'Cause I can literally see you
with your shirt off laying in bed.

90
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.896
- That's how I know.
- That doesn't mean I'm not busy.

91
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:11.734
- I'm thinking.
- It kind of means you're not busy.

92
00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:14.572
This is important. Gorka. Can you
please just come out here for a second?

93
00:07:14.607 --> 00:07:17.300
God's sake. Listen.
you're ruining my day.

94
00:07:17.335 --> 00:07:20.479
- I was busy.
- My mother's dead.

95
00:07:23.946 --> 00:07:26.144
Oh. I'm sorry for your loss.

96
00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:28.047
She may be surrounded by angels.

97
00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:30.280
She might be. but I have
some questions about schedule

98
00:07:30.315 --> 00:07:31.523
that I'd like to do now.

99
00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:36.924
- Meet me by the vegetables.
- Why can't we just do it now?

100
00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:38.629
Hey. and don't bring
your asshole dog.

101
00:07:38.664 --> 00:07:41.764
Don't call my dog
an asshole. you asshole.

102
00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:45.801
God damn it!
What's your problem?

103
00:07:49.642 --> 00:07:53.545
- Are you okay?
- Honest to God. close your robe a little bit. man.

104
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.338
- I can see everything.
- Fuck. it's so hot.

105
00:07:55.373 --> 00:07:57.142
You know what?
Let's have some wine inside.

106
00:07:57.177 --> 00:07:59.111
Hey. Gorka. let me just ask
you a scheduling question.

107
00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:01.344
- Come inside. Let's have some wine.
- Am I free to leave next week?

108
00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:03.357
Let's have some wine.

109
00:08:04.987 --> 00:08:07.988
- Gorka. can we please?
- One second.

110
00:08:10.993 --> 00:08:13.026
Losing a mother
is a terrible thing.

111
00:08:13.061 --> 00:08:15.798
Something you'll never forget.

112
00:08:15.833 --> 00:08:18.196
It only happens once
in your lifetime.

113
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:22.706
Yeah. that makes sense.

114
00:08:22.741 --> 00:08:25.643
Hey. can I ask you
a scheduling question just...

115
00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:28.371
- Can I say something first?
- It's pretty important that I get this out of the way.

116
00:08:28.406 --> 00:08:32.419
Your mother abandoned you as a
12-year-old boy for a cult. didn't she?

117
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:36.379
She left you to fend
for yourself. didn't she?

118
00:08:36.414 --> 00:08:40.383
- Correct.
- And then. sure. since you grew up.

119
00:08:40.418 --> 00:08:43.386
she has tried occasionally to come
to see a concert and call you. right?

120
00:08:43.421 --> 00:08:46.158
- She has. yeah.
- To fix your failed relationship.

121
00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:49.128
I don't know that.
I never called her back.

122
00:08:49.163 --> 00:08:51.229
But now she's dead.

123
00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:53.638
But now she's dead.

124
00:08:53.673 --> 00:08:56.102
Well. I do not weep
for that woman.

125
00:08:56.137 --> 00:08:59.677
Fuck that woman.
Fuck this person. this asshole.

126
00:08:59.712 --> 00:09:03.340
I have zero love for that woman like
this. abandoning her child.

127
00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:06.618
- You finished?
- I'm finished.

128
00:09:06.653 --> 00:09:09.654
- Okay. so...
- Not even animals abandon their childs.

129
00:09:09.689 --> 00:09:10.853
Not even cockroaches.
Think about it.

130
00:09:10.888 --> 00:09:12.888
Your mother is worse
than a cockroach.

131
00:09:12.923 --> 00:09:15.726
I don't think cockroaches
raise their kids.

132
00:09:15.761 --> 00:09:18.993
Don't talk to me about cockroaches
because I am very familiar.

133
00:09:19.028 --> 00:09:22.161
They're like a herd. They take care
of each other. They're like elephants.

134
00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:24.867
- That is not accurate.
- By the way. you're cabin is full of cockroaches.

135
00:09:24.902 --> 00:09:27.430
- We have to take care of that.
- Can I please ask my question?

136
00:09:27.465 --> 00:09:31.434
- Yeah. go ahead.
- Can I leave for a little bit and miss a rehearsal or two?

137
00:09:31.469 --> 00:09:34.008
I gotta go run up to her
cabin up near Yosemite.

138
00:09:34.043 --> 00:09:37.583
- Of course you can.
- Great.

139
00:09:37.618 --> 00:09:39.585
'Cause I don't want to lose the band.
It's a big priority for me.

140
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.247
- No. no. you can go.
- You'll talk to them?

141
00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:45.283
Yeah. I will talk to them.
and if a gig comes up. I'll just call you.

142
00:09:46.726 --> 00:09:50.420
- That was it.
- You woke me up for that?

143
00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:52.059
Well. I woke you up
to tell you my mother died

144
00:09:52.094 --> 00:09:55.293
and ask if I could
leave for a week. yes.

145
00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:57.097
All right. Cheers.

146
00:09:57.132 --> 00:10:01.233
- Cheers.
- To your dead. shitty. asshole mother.

147
00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:03.741
- Cheers. bud.
- Cheers.

148
00:10:07.747 --> 00:10:11.078
- That's actually a really shitty wine. man.
- I know.

149
00:10:42.111 --> 00:10:43.979
All right. let's go.

150
00:10:48.249 --> 00:10:49.655
Good girl.

151
00:10:52.286 --> 00:10:53.659
Okay.

152
00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:56.761
([engine starting)

153
00:10:56.796 --> 00:10:58.994
Leif. hey!

154
00:10:59.029 --> 00:11:01.326
I was thinking
about it last night

155
00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:03.867
and you shouldn't be
resentful with your mother.

156
00:11:03.902 --> 00:11:07.233
- Twice she came to see you. but you never...
- I cannot hear you.

157
00:11:07.268 --> 00:11:09.675
- So maybe you...
- Gorka. I cannot hear you.

158
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.908
...her being a bad mother. you know what I mean?

159
00:11:11.943 --> 00:11:13.778
You said it yourself.

160
00:11:13.813 --> 00:11:16.506
She tried to apologize. but
you never gave her the chance.

161
00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:18.882
You can't live
with that anger inside.

162
00:11:18.917 --> 00:11:21.478
- You have to forgive.
- Okay. thank you.

163
00:11:21.513 --> 00:11:23.557
Will you do that?
Do you understand?

164
00:11:26.793 --> 00:11:29.156
Cheers. my friend.
All the best.

165
00:12:30.087 --> 00:12:33.055
If my mother's one thing. Nora.
it's unpredictable.

166
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.421
This list could be...
it could be anything.

167
00:12:36.456 --> 00:12:38.225
I mean. it could
take us anywhere.

168
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.426
Anything. I could be
taking you literally anywhere

169
00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:42.801
and you don't know.

170
00:12:42.836 --> 00:12:45.232
I wish I had dog brains
half the time.

171
00:12:45.267 --> 00:12:48.070
It would make life easier.

172
00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:22.302
All right. come on. kid.
Come on.

173
00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:29.782
Wow.

174
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.117
What do you think?

175
00:13:35.152 --> 00:13:36.514
Kind of nice.

176
00:13:41.928 --> 00:13:43.961
Looks like
she's still painting.

177
00:13:49.166 --> 00:13:51.331
This is where I got
my artistic side.

178
00:13:55.007 --> 00:13:56.336
Nice mustache.

179
00:14:14.554 --> 00:14:17.764
Yeah. nunchucks.

180
00:14:40.283 --> 00:14:42.745
Look at that little shit.

181
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.615
Little bongo man.

182
00:14:52.229 --> 00:14:53.800
Look at that.

183
00:15:01.403 --> 00:15:04.404
Okay. let's share
our last joint.

184
00:15:32.071 --> 00:15:33.268
I don't know.

185
00:15:36.075 --> 00:15:39.846
That was my dog growing up.
He didn't have a name.

186
00:15:39.881 --> 00:15:43.014
Honey believed that animals
shouldn't be named.

187
00:15:43.049 --> 00:15:46.083
but apparently she was okay
with them wearing wigs.

188
00:15:48.054 --> 00:15:51.286
Makes no sense to me.
that woman.

189
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.107
All right.

190
00:16:21.582 --> 00:16:24.385
Honey. what the fuck?

191
00:16:27.489 --> 00:16:29.324
Oh. shit.

192
00:16:45.342 --> 00:16:46.913
Ooh.

193
00:16:59.488 --> 00:17:02.786
Oh. why so many cabinets?

194
00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:05.723
Aah! Jesus.

195
00:17:20.542 --> 00:17:24.709
- Hello?
- Who the fuck is this?

196
00:17:24.744 --> 00:17:27.712
- Excuse me?
- Who the fuck is this?

197
00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:30.121
I'm sorry.
Are you looking for Honey?

198
00:17:30.156 --> 00:17:33.355
No. this is between
you and me now. sugar dick.

199
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.357
You're just a piece of ass.
do you understand that?

200
00:17:35.392 --> 00:17:36.919
Did you just call me
a sugar dick?

201
00:17:36.954 --> 00:17:38.525
Yeah. that's all you are.

202
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.923
You are just a piece
of candy ass.

203
00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.134
I'm a... I'm a candy ass?

204
00:17:43.169 --> 00:17:45.928
- Well. thank you for that. sir.
- Yeah. yeah.

205
00:17:45.963 --> 00:17:47.534
Thank you for calling me
a candy ass.

206
00:17:47.569 --> 00:17:50.207
You are nothing more
than a fuck boy!

207
00:17:50.242 --> 00:17:53.375
Fuck boy? Wow.
Okay. great.

208
00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.212
- You think this is funny?
- Kinda.

209
00:17:55.247 --> 00:17:57.379
All right. well. let's see
how long you're laughing.

210
00:17:57.414 --> 00:17:59.150
I didn't mean to laugh.

211
00:17:59.185 --> 00:18:02.219
It's just I haven't been called
a fuck boy in. well. ever.

212
00:18:02.254 --> 00:18:05.992
Ha-ha-ha. I promise you do not want
to go to war with me. young ass.

213
00:18:06.027 --> 00:18:09.226
- Okay. man. who is this?
- I'm coming for you. fuck boy!

214
00:18:30.007 --> 00:18:31.611
Of course.

215
00:18:50.027 --> 00:18:52.995
I'm too stoned for this.

216
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.272
Yeah. sugar dick needs
to sober up.

217
00:18:57.111 --> 00:19:00.046
Nora. let's go
check out upstairs.

218
00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:11.651
Nora. please.
It's too loud.

219
00:19:21.498 --> 00:19:24.829
You awake? Psst.

220
00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:28.833
Can't sleep 'cause
it's a weird new place?

221
00:19:33.873 --> 00:19:35.675
You awake?

222
00:19:38.075 --> 00:19:40.812
Should we just go to the van.
get you some sleep?

223
00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:43.045
Yeah. let's go
to the van for you.

224
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.355
I think you'll be
more comfortable there.

225
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.489
All right.

226
00:19:49.053 --> 00:19:50.393
This is better. huh?

227
00:19:54.025 --> 00:19:56.366
Good night. Nora.

228
00:19:56.401 --> 00:19:59.666
Tomorrow.
we do the list. okay?

229
00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:01.668
And we get a cabin.

230
00:20:32.272 --> 00:20:36.637
Hi. Leif. Hi. Hi.

231
00:20:36.672 --> 00:20:39.442
Wow. look at me talking to you
even though I'm dead.

232
00:20:39.477 --> 00:20:42.445
That's trippy. right?

233
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.711
You probably thought you were
finally rid of me. didn't you?

234
00:20:44.746 --> 00:20:46.977
Well. afraid not.

235
00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:49.012
See. energy
cannot be destroyed.

236
00:20:49.047 --> 00:20:53.357
so I'm still here
spiritually in this room

237
00:20:53.392 --> 00:20:56.393
watching you watch me.

238
00:20:56.428 --> 00:20:58.593
I'm right there.

239
00:20:58.628 --> 00:21:02.630
I'm right behind you. Boo!

240
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:08.438
Oh. that was a good one.
I got you.

241
00:21:08.473 --> 00:21:10.770
- Nope.
- I got you. I know. Yeah. I did.

242
00:21:10.805 --> 00:21:16.578
Oh. okay.
Well. this is the deal.

243
00:21:16.613 --> 00:21:18.943
Um. I made this video.

244
00:21:18.978 --> 00:21:21.418
Uh. I'm doing this...

245
00:21:21.453 --> 00:21:24.949
well. I know...

246
00:21:24.984 --> 00:21:30.592
I wasn't the mother
that you wished I'd been.

247
00:21:30.627 --> 00:21:33.760
And I... I didn't fulfill
my motherly responsibilities.

248
00:21:33.795 --> 00:21:37.962
I did not teach you enough
stuff. and now I'm dead.

249
00:21:37.997 --> 00:21:43.770
So. I'm going
to make this list

250
00:21:43.805 --> 00:21:48.412
of all the things that
are so important that I know.

251
00:21:48.447 --> 00:21:52.647
and I'm gonna pass it
on to you with this video.

252
00:21:55.289 --> 00:21:58.686
Yeah. so.

253
00:21:58.721 --> 00:22:03.988
face me and say.

254
00:22:04.023 --> 00:22:06.188
"Honey.

255
00:22:06.223 --> 00:22:10.566
I promise that I will
do my best to do this list."

256
00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:14.999
I will do the list. Honey.

257
00:22:15.034 --> 00:22:16.836
I'll try my hardest.

258
00:22:22.041 --> 00:22:24.074
Come on.
say it for your mom.

259
00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:27.044
- I'll wait.
- Just did it.

260
00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:29.717
Don't be shy. I can wait.

261
00:22:29.752 --> 00:22:32.324
I can wait all night. I'm dead.
I'm not going anywhere.

262
00:22:32.359 --> 00:22:35.327
Your gaps aren't working.
I did it the first time.

263
00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:38.660
Good boy. Okay.

264
00:22:38.695 --> 00:22:44.468
So. number one is called

265
00:22:44.503 --> 00:22:46.272
express yourself.

266
00:22:46.307 --> 00:22:49.836
Take the envelope
and go into the garage

267
00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:52.674
and get the green boat.
which is pretty heavy.

268
00:22:52.709 --> 00:22:55.842
But. you know. what's success
without a bit of struggle?

269
00:22:55.877 --> 00:22:59.043
And then you open
the envelope

270
00:22:59.078 --> 00:23:00.748
and there's more instructions.

271
00:23:00.783 --> 00:23:03.113
That's kind of fun. right?

272
00:23:03.148 --> 00:23:06.754
Good. That's it.
Stop the tape.

273
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:10.692
Are you lingering?
Don't... don't linger.

274
00:23:10.727 --> 00:23:12.221
You have to do these
one at a time.

275
00:23:12.256 --> 00:23:15.499
Please stop the tape.
Stop it. please.

276
00:23:15.534 --> 00:23:18.898
- I fucking tried so hard to get this all set up.
- Okay. okay. Shut up.

277
00:23:20.066 --> 00:23:21.505
Oh. my God.

278
00:23:37.985 --> 00:23:41.459
Oh. Oh. is that heavy.

279
00:23:41.494 --> 00:23:43.890
Oh. fuck me.

280
00:23:43.925 --> 00:23:46.189
I hate you. Honey.

281
00:23:46.224 --> 00:23:47.960
Okay.

282
00:23:51.328 --> 00:23:54.098
Okay. Okay.

283
00:23:55.134 --> 00:23:56.639
Let's see what I'm doing.

284
00:23:57.939 --> 00:24:01.039
All right. first.

285
00:24:01.074 --> 00:24:06.352
"Talk about your feelings
about me and my death."

286
00:24:07.344 --> 00:24:09.080
You gotta be kidding me.

287
00:24:09.115 --> 00:24:10.752
I didn't have to bring
a fucking boat

288
00:24:10.787 --> 00:24:12.787
down to the lake for that.

289
00:24:12.822 --> 00:24:17.121
"You hold too much inside.
It's like poison."

290
00:24:17.156 --> 00:24:20.531
Okay. Do you want to know how
I feel about your death?

291
00:24:20.566 --> 00:24:23.325
Nothing.

292
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.931
I know I should feel sad.
but I don't.

293
00:24:24.966 --> 00:24:26.933
I feel nothing.

294
00:24:26.968 --> 00:24:31.333
So. sorry. but. uh.

295
00:24:31.368 --> 00:24:33.302
we didn't know
each other enough.

296
00:24:33.337 --> 00:24:37.273
Watch me.

297
00:24:37.308 --> 00:24:41.310
Good. Then row to
the other side of the lake.

298
00:24:41.345 --> 00:24:43.312
and while you're rowing.

299
00:24:43.347 --> 00:24:45.589
enjoy the water.

300
00:24:45.624 --> 00:24:47.756
Feel its energy.

301
00:24:47.791 --> 00:24:49.560
I did this journey daily
for years.

302
00:24:49.595 --> 00:24:51.958
It was one of my escapes.

303
00:24:51.993 --> 00:24:56.358
In the middle of the lake.
I allowed myself to miss you

304
00:24:56.393 --> 00:24:58.569
and to think about regrets.

305
00:24:58.604 --> 00:25:00.362
You can do it. too.
if you want.

306
00:25:00.397 --> 00:25:02.166
I mean.
we all have regrets. Leif.

307
00:25:02.201 --> 00:25:04.366
It's normal.

308
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:07.578
Now. your next task.

309
00:25:07.613 --> 00:25:09.371
You're looking for a house

310
00:25:09.406 --> 00:25:12.847
that's brown
with a green roof.

311
00:25:12.882 --> 00:25:14.618
It's really easy to find.

312
00:25:14.653 --> 00:25:16.345
You can't miss it
unless you're super high.

313
00:25:20.021 --> 00:25:21.988
Okay.

314
00:25:22.023 --> 00:25:23.528
Use the key provided...

315
00:25:32.539 --> 00:25:36.200
...then drop the envelope
marked "C" on the pillow

316
00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:39.643
in the back bedroom.

317
00:25:39.678 --> 00:25:42.206
and then get your ass
out of there.

318
00:25:56.057 --> 00:25:57.056
Easy enough.

319
00:26:17.309 --> 00:26:20.981
"Hey. dipshit!
I owe you nothing. you rat fuck!"

320
00:26:23.216 --> 00:26:25.051
All right. what am I doing?

321
00:26:25.086 --> 00:26:27.691
This is insane. Okay.

322
00:26:27.726 --> 00:26:29.088
All right. let's go.

323
00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:48.332
Fuck!

324
00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:50.367
Congratulations.
You did it.

325
00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:52.270
Congrats?
I could have been killed.

326
00:27:52.305 --> 00:27:54.778
You went to the lake
and you expressed yourself

327
00:27:54.813 --> 00:27:57.781
and you took all that toxic
energy and you got rid of it.

328
00:27:57.816 --> 00:27:59.981
because if you don't.
that's gonna kill you.

329
00:28:00.016 --> 00:28:02.753
I am so happy for you.
I am so happy for you.

330
00:28:02.788 --> 00:28:05.349
I'm happy for me. too.
That's great.

331
00:28:05.384 --> 00:28:08.792
In terms of breaking into
the guy's house. okay.

332
00:28:08.827 --> 00:28:12.554
um. well.

333
00:28:12.589 --> 00:28:14.798
I can't say that
that was a lesson.

334
00:28:14.833 --> 00:28:18.362
Uh. honestly. he was just an
ass and it needed to be done.

335
00:28:18.397 --> 00:28:20.738
and you did your mom a solid.
so thank you.

336
00:28:20.773 --> 00:28:22.168
Oh. for fuck's sake.

337
00:28:22.203 --> 00:28:24.170
Okay. so now
I can go on to two.

338
00:28:24.205 --> 00:28:27.008
You're gonna like this one.

339
00:28:27.043 --> 00:28:30.077
Love is important.

340
00:28:30.112 --> 00:28:32.541
Now. I've Googled you
and I know that you don't

341
00:28:32.576 --> 00:28:35.181
have a girlfriend
or a boyfriend.

342
00:28:35.216 --> 00:28:39.020
so I want you to call
the one who got away

343
00:28:39.055 --> 00:28:41.792
and say you're sorry.

344
00:28:41.827 --> 00:28:45.554
Oh. you know who that is.
I don't have to tell you.

345
00:28:45.589 --> 00:28:47.831
You know. you hold
too many grudges. sweetheart.

346
00:28:47.866 --> 00:28:49.591
I mean. if somebody hurts
your feelings. you're just...

347
00:28:49.626 --> 00:28:51.593
you just write them off.
They're done. that's it.

348
00:28:51.628 --> 00:28:54.035
Gone.

349
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:58.534
So go ahead. do it now.
Make the call.

350
00:28:58.569 --> 00:29:02.406
All right. All right.
I'll call an ex-girlfriend.

351
00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:04.210
This one's easy.

352
00:29:07.446 --> 00:29:08.445
I'm definitely
not calling Marnie.

353
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.216
She's insane.

354
00:29:10.251 --> 00:29:12.086
I'm not calling Ayako.

355
00:29:12.121 --> 00:29:13.857
Stephanie's not the one
that got away.

356
00:29:13.892 --> 00:29:18.224
Stephanie's the one
I can't get rid of.

357
00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:22.063
Not Judy. that's for sure.

358
00:29:22.098 --> 00:29:26.232
Could it be Lindsey?
Did Lindsey get away? No.

359
00:29:26.267 --> 00:29:28.630
Lindsey's dad was cool.

360
00:29:28.665 --> 00:29:31.237
We used to go fishing.
He was fun.

361
00:29:31.272 --> 00:29:33.470
Maybe her dad's the one
that got away.

362
00:29:36.112 --> 00:29:39.278
But I guess
it could be Audrey.

363
00:29:39.313 --> 00:29:42.248
Yeah. maybe it's Audrey. Nora.

364
00:29:42.283 --> 00:29:44.789
Maybe Audrey got away.

365
00:29:44.824 --> 00:29:48.727
At least she'll be funny
about it. right?

366
00:29:48.762 --> 00:29:50.652
Sorry that. uh...

367
00:29:50.687 --> 00:29:52.654
and then. um. I hope if I...

368
00:29:52.689 --> 00:29:54.095
yeah. that you forgive me

369
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.460
and I don't want
any hard feelings.

370
00:29:56.495 --> 00:29:59.661
So. I just. you know...

371
00:29:59.696 --> 00:30:01.300
I think you're a cool person.

372
00:30:10.146 --> 00:30:13.917
- Hello?
- Hey. is that Audrey?

373
00:30:13.952 --> 00:30:17.723
- Yeah. Who's this?
- Hey. Audrey. It's Leif.

374
00:30:21.157 --> 00:30:22.959
Um. old on a sec.

375
00:30:27.724 --> 00:30:29.196
Hi. I'm sorry.
Who did you say this was?

376
00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:32.936
Oh. yeah. it's Leif.

377
00:30:32.971 --> 00:30:34.498
- Leif.
- Yeah. Leif.

378
00:30:34.533 --> 00:30:36.368
Sorry. is that
a name or a word?

379
00:30:36.403 --> 00:30:38.909
Do you not remem...

380
00:30:38.944 --> 00:30:40.504
Audrey. it's Leif Reinhold.

381
00:30:40.539 --> 00:30:44.706
We dated for about three years.

382
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:48.314
Right. of course.
And when was that?

383
00:30:48.349 --> 00:30:50.822
How many people have
you dated named Leif?

384
00:30:50.857 --> 00:30:52.824
Shoot. You know what?
Here's what we should do.

385
00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:55.321
Why don't you give me your phone
number. I'll write it down.

386
00:30:55.356 --> 00:30:58.159
and then if I can
remember who you are.

387
00:30:58.194 --> 00:31:00.425
I'll just give you
a call back.

388
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.935
Uh. yeah. fine.

389
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:10.534
- It's 323-44...
- Ooh!

390
00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:12.976
You started giving me
your number

391
00:31:13.011 --> 00:31:14.340
- because you thought I couldn't remember you.
- Nice. Well done.

392
00:31:14.375 --> 00:31:18.344
- You total asshole.
- You're so dumb. Leif.

393
00:31:18.379 --> 00:31:22.744
Oh. buddy. How are you. bud?
I haven't seen you forever.

394
00:31:22.779 --> 00:31:26.957
Good. You know. apart from the
heart attack you gave me. I'm good.

395
00:31:26.992 --> 00:31:32.963
- How are you?
- Let's see. How am I the last eight years?

396
00:31:32.998 --> 00:31:36.263
- I'm good.
- Let's go with good. Well. good.

397
00:31:36.298 --> 00:31:39.563
- How are you?
- I'm. uh... well. I mean. yeah. good.

398
00:31:39.598 --> 00:31:43.204
besides. um. my...

399
00:31:43.239 --> 00:31:45.811
um. my mother died.

400
00:31:47.804 --> 00:31:51.575
- Huh.
- Yeah. she had cancer. so...

401
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.380
Is that a...
is that a good thing?

402
00:31:54.415 --> 00:31:57.020
Is that a good thing
that my mom died?

403
00:31:57.055 --> 00:31:59.781
No. hold on. I mean. like.
because you didn't really like her.

404
00:31:59.816 --> 00:32:01.992
- You kind of hated her. right?
- No. I didn't kind of hate her.

405
00:32:02.027 --> 00:32:03.389
I just didn't know her.

406
00:32:03.424 --> 00:32:04.786
You guys didn't
really get along.

407
00:32:04.821 --> 00:32:06.590
No. I did not hate my mother.

408
00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:10.836
You kind of had. like.
weird mommy issues with her.

409
00:32:10.871 --> 00:32:14.235
I did not have mommy issues.

410
00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.908
I'm so glad I called you.
This has been wonderful.

411
00:32:16.943 --> 00:32:20.802
Okay. so why
are you calling me?

412
00:32:20.837 --> 00:32:23.244
Do you need money or something?
I don't have money.

413
00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:24.740
Call the next person
on your list.

414
00:32:24.775 --> 00:32:27.248
I don't need money.

415
00:32:27.283 --> 00:32:29.646
When my mom died.
she left me her cabin.

416
00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:33.353
but she did this thing
that's annoying

417
00:32:33.388 --> 00:32:35.025
but it's
a conditional inheritance.

418
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.818
I have to do this to-do list

419
00:32:36.853 --> 00:32:38.820
she put together
in order to get it.

420
00:32:38.855 --> 00:32:40.624
Wait. so she's like.
I love you.

421
00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:42.824
but my love is conditional
on whether or not

422
00:32:42.859 --> 00:32:44.364
you can complete these tasks?

423
00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:47.268
- Yeah. it's exactly that.
- Oof. Okay.

424
00:32:47.303 --> 00:32:48.830
So what are the tasks?

425
00:32:48.865 --> 00:32:52.438
Well. one of the tasks is to...

426
00:32:52.473 --> 00:32:56.079
is to the call the one
that got away and say...

427
00:32:56.114 --> 00:32:57.113
and say sorry.

428
00:32:57.148 --> 00:33:01.051
So why are you calling me?

429
00:33:01.086 --> 00:33:03.647
Oh! Wait a second.
Hold on.

430
00:33:03.682 --> 00:33:05.847
Am I the one
that got away. Leif?

431
00:33:05.882 --> 00:33:09.653
I mean. you might be.
The early 2000s are a total blur.

432
00:33:09.688 --> 00:33:12.293
Here's what I do know.
I still have your phone number.

433
00:33:12.328 --> 00:33:13.789
Wow. God.

434
00:33:13.824 --> 00:33:18.464
That is so romantic
and so weird. but...

435
00:33:18.499 --> 00:33:20.664
Good.
Well. I'm glad it's nice.

436
00:33:20.699 --> 00:33:22.864
I don't know.
I kind of like it.

437
00:33:22.899 --> 00:33:24.305
So how are you doing
with all this?

438
00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.802
With the death and everything?

439
00:33:26.837 --> 00:33:28.672
Oh. uh. you know.

440
00:33:28.707 --> 00:33:30.674
honestly. I'm not
feeling much of anything.

441
00:33:30.709 --> 00:33:35.316
I'm... I didn't call you to.
you know... how are you doing?

442
00:33:35.351 --> 00:33:37.879
With your mom's death?
I mean. I'm okay.

443
00:33:37.914 --> 00:33:39.188
I didn't know her
that well either.

444
00:33:39.223 --> 00:33:41.520
No. you asshole.
With your life.

445
00:33:41.555 --> 00:33:44.886
In my life. Hmm.

446
00:33:44.921 --> 00:33:46.855
I'm fine.

447
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:52.498
Fine. Fine.
Well. I don't know. are you married?

448
00:33:52.533 --> 00:33:53.532
Single?

449
00:33:53.567 --> 00:33:55.501
Working?

450
00:33:55.536 --> 00:33:57.899
Traveling with the circus?

451
00:33:57.934 --> 00:33:59.901
My boyfriend
and I just split up.

452
00:33:59.936 --> 00:34:01.903
so I'm dealing
with break-up stuff.

453
00:34:01.938 --> 00:34:03.740
and. you know.
break up stuff is not fun.

454
00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:06.908
Well. what happened?

455
00:34:06.943 --> 00:34:08.910
Let's just be girlfriends
and gab about it.

456
00:34:08.945 --> 00:34:11.913
It's complicated.
I don't want to talk about it. It's dumb.

457
00:34:11.948 --> 00:34:14.718
- It's nothing.
- I just told you my mother died.

458
00:34:14.753 --> 00:34:17.127
- You owe me something.
- Okay. That's a good point.

459
00:34:17.162 --> 00:34:21.527
It's just that it's boring and
you're going to judge me for it.

460
00:34:21.562 --> 00:34:26.532
I am alone in my dead
mother's cabin feeling nothing.

461
00:34:26.567 --> 00:34:29.931
- I would love to judge you.
- Okay. You know what?

462
00:34:29.966 --> 00:34:33.374
Let me. um... let me just call you back
in. like. ten minutes.

463
00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:36.146
- Are you around?
- Yeah. yeah. Of course. yeah.

464
00:34:36.181 --> 00:34:38.775
- Great. Okay. bye.
- Bye. Leif.

465
00:34:47.588 --> 00:34:49.291
She's great. right?
That's Audrey.

466
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:52.954
She's going to call back.
I'm going to take a quick shower.

467
00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:55.099
I don't want... yeah.
I'm going to take a shower.

468
00:35:04.803 --> 00:35:07.804
Coming! Coming!

469
00:35:11.612 --> 00:35:12.611
Hello.

470
00:35:12.646 --> 00:35:14.976
Why are you out of breath?

471
00:35:15.011 --> 00:35:16.582
Oh. I just got out
of the shower.

472
00:35:16.617 --> 00:35:18.188
I had to run downstairs.

473
00:35:18.223 --> 00:35:20.421
You took a shower? Why?

474
00:35:20.456 --> 00:35:21.983
I realized while
we were talking

475
00:35:22.018 --> 00:35:23.226
I hadn't showered
in a little bit.

476
00:35:23.261 --> 00:35:24.986
so I thought
I'd take a shower.

477
00:35:25.021 --> 00:35:27.593
You do know that I can't smell
you over the phone. right?

478
00:35:27.628 --> 00:35:29.859
Right. well. I wasn't
willing to take any chances.

479
00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:32.796
Why? Did you not take a shower
since the last time we talked?

480
00:35:32.831 --> 00:35:36.338
Since we hung up ten minutes ago?
No. I didn't take a shower.

481
00:35:36.373 --> 00:35:40.606
Gross. All right.
so tell me about this guy.

482
00:35:40.641 --> 00:35:42.443
I'm dying to judge you.

483
00:35:42.478 --> 00:35:44.511
I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

484
00:35:44.546 --> 00:35:47.613
Let's change the subject.
Tell me what you're up to.

485
00:35:47.648 --> 00:35:49.153
What's going on in your life?

486
00:35:49.188 --> 00:35:52.750
Uh. yeah. I mean.
I'm still making music.

487
00:35:52.785 --> 00:35:57.018
I'm in a band right now with some super
talented kid. It's called Restaurant.

488
00:35:57.053 --> 00:35:59.625
- We've actually just finished touring Asia.
- Hold on now.

489
00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:03.024
Did you just say you're in
a band called Restaurant. sir?

490
00:36:04.599 --> 00:36:06.467
Yeah. I'm in a band
called Restaurant.

491
00:36:06.502 --> 00:36:08.139
That's not good.

492
00:36:08.174 --> 00:36:10.031
Really. it's such
a talented group

493
00:36:10.066 --> 00:36:11.835
of smart musicians.
and I think...

494
00:36:14.675 --> 00:36:17.478
Audrey?
Audrey. are you drilling?

495
00:36:17.513 --> 00:36:19.711
There's all of a sudden
a really weird sound.

496
00:36:19.746 --> 00:36:22.846
No. Sorry. sorry.
I'm making soup.

497
00:36:22.881 --> 00:36:25.849
I'm just... I thought
it would be quieter. Sorry.

498
00:36:25.884 --> 00:36:28.049
Did you just start
when I started talking?

499
00:36:28.084 --> 00:36:29.655
No. you're right. I'm sorry.

500
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:31.657
Tell me more about your band.

501
00:36:31.692 --> 00:36:34.627
Uh. yeah.
These kids are so good.

502
00:36:34.662 --> 00:36:37.300
I feel like we could hit
a pop song or two.

503
00:36:37.335 --> 00:36:40.270
and I really... I feel like...

504
00:36:40.305 --> 00:36:43.669
- Hey! Audrey!
- Hee-hee.

505
00:36:43.704 --> 00:36:47.068
I'm not falling for it.
I'm not falling for it again.

506
00:36:47.103 --> 00:36:49.279
Okay. will you just wait
while I make this soup

507
00:36:49.314 --> 00:36:50.874
and then we can really talk?

508
00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:52.876
You want me to wait
while you make soup.

509
00:36:52.911 --> 00:36:55.516
Just wait.
What else are you doing?

510
00:36:55.551 --> 00:36:57.078
Fine. go make your soup.

511
00:36:57.113 --> 00:36:58.882
But I am telling you
about my band

512
00:36:58.917 --> 00:37:00.686
and my hopes
and my dreams later.

513
00:37:00.721 --> 00:37:02.127
and you are going to
pretend to care.

514
00:37:02.162 --> 00:37:05.526
- Okay. great.
- I'm hanging up.

515
00:37:05.561 --> 00:37:07.891
- I'm not going to wait.
- Leif?

516
00:37:07.926 --> 00:37:09.695
- Call me back.
- Leif. stop talking.

517
00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:11.301
Listen.
I'm going to just hang up

518
00:37:11.336 --> 00:37:12.335
and I'll call you back. okay?

519
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:13.336
That's what I just said.

520
00:37:13.371 --> 00:37:17.637
- Bye.
- Bye.

521
00:37:19.938 --> 00:37:22.873
Okay. the next task is called

522
00:37:22.908 --> 00:37:27.185
eat what you kill.

523
00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.716
Now. you have to know

524
00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:35.358
how to survive on your own
in the wild.

525
00:37:35.393 --> 00:37:38.559
You have to know how to fight
for what you care about.

526
00:37:38.594 --> 00:37:41.364
- how to be passionate about what you love...
- This is insane.

527
00:37:41.399 --> 00:37:44.730
...how to stand up
to get what you want.

528
00:37:44.765 --> 00:37:46.094
make it known.

529
00:37:46.129 --> 00:37:50.131
Be the predator.
not the prey.

530
00:37:50.166 --> 00:37:52.738
Go catch a fish
with your hands.

531
00:37:52.773 --> 00:37:54.575
You know. throw a rock
on its head.

532
00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:56.940
Be part of the natural world.

533
00:39:34.479 --> 00:39:36.281
She's insane.

534
00:39:36.316 --> 00:39:38.041
Your mother
is a crazy person.

535
00:39:38.076 --> 00:39:40.846
- Yep.
- Aren't you supposed to be. like.

536
00:39:40.881 --> 00:39:42.881
apologizing to me
or something?

537
00:39:42.916 --> 00:39:45.950
Right.
I actually kind of forgot.

538
00:39:45.985 --> 00:39:49.525
Right. So. when are
you going to do it?

539
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.056
Well. it can happen now.
Should I do it now?

540
00:39:53.091 --> 00:39:55.432
Yeah. Let's do it.
Get it over with.

541
00:39:55.467 --> 00:40:01.262
Okay. Audrey. I'm sorry.

542
00:40:01.297 --> 00:40:06.377
- For what?
- Um. I'm sorry for breaking your heart?

543
00:40:06.412 --> 00:40:09.875
- No. you didn't break my heart.
- I don't know.

544
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:13.274
My mommy's making me do it
and I have major mommy issues.

545
00:40:13.309 --> 00:40:15.243
Okay. you happy now?
Do I get her cabin?

546
00:40:15.278 --> 00:40:18.246
Aww. that's not
a good apology. Come on.

547
00:40:18.281 --> 00:40:21.084
All right. well.
here's the truth.

548
00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:27.090
Um. I'm sorry if I didn't.
you know. fight for us

549
00:40:27.125 --> 00:40:31.292
because honestly
you're the smartest

550
00:40:31.327 --> 00:40:34.097
and the funniest and the
sexiest person I've ever dated

551
00:40:34.132 --> 00:40:38.541
and I'm sorry
I fucked it up.

552
00:40:38.576 --> 00:40:39.773
You are?

553
00:40:41.942 --> 00:40:44.305
Yeah.
If I could do it again.

554
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:48.210
I would've done it differently.

555
00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:52.918
So. what?
You get your mom's cabin now?

556
00:40:52.953 --> 00:40:57.318
Well. no. I have to do
the rest of her list.

557
00:40:57.353 --> 00:40:58.924
but then I get her cabin. yeah.

558
00:40:58.959 --> 00:41:00.761
Wait. what do I get
out of this?

559
00:41:00.796 --> 00:41:03.324
- Do I get anything?
- No. you don't get anything.

560
00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:05.766
- Wait a sec...
- You get the apology.

561
00:41:05.801 --> 00:41:08.505
You got a raw deal. You got screwed.
I'm sorry for that.

562
00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:12.410
- That sucks.
- It's really not fair. It's a really raw deal.

563
00:41:12.445 --> 00:41:16.139
- I'm kind of drunk.
- Yeah. actually.

564
00:41:16.174 --> 00:41:19.549
Speaking of. me. too.

565
00:41:19.584 --> 00:41:21.782
I'm not going to have
phone sex with you.

566
00:41:21.817 --> 00:41:24.345
- Excuse me?
- I'm not going to have phone sex with you.

567
00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.655
That's a weird turn.
Who said anything about phone sex?

568
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:30.186
Well. I'm just saying if that's why
you called me. I'm not doing that.

569
00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:31.957
That is not why I called.

570
00:41:31.992 --> 00:41:34.322
You're the one who keeps
talking about phone sex.

571
00:41:34.357 --> 00:41:38.095
Okay. well. tell me that
you're not thinking about it.

572
00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:41.362
Well. I am thinking about it
now because you brought it up.

573
00:41:41.397 --> 00:41:44.508
but I promise I wasn't
thinking about it before.

574
00:41:44.543 --> 00:41:47.104
So. should we do it?

575
00:41:47.139 --> 00:41:48.809
Okay. fuck it.
Let's do it.

576
00:41:48.844 --> 00:41:51.174
But I want to say
right off the bat.

577
00:41:51.209 --> 00:41:53.374
I don't think we're
going to be good at it.

578
00:41:53.409 --> 00:41:55.178
I think it's going to be
a little bit embarrassing.

579
00:41:55.213 --> 00:41:57.180
This was never
really our vibe.

580
00:41:57.215 --> 00:42:01.217
Okay. well. since I've been with
you. I've been with many a man.

581
00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:03.384
- Weird brag.
- What I mean is.

582
00:42:03.419 --> 00:42:06.090
I have gotten
really good at phone sex.

583
00:42:06.125 --> 00:42:09.830
All right.
Um. who goes first?

584
00:42:09.865 --> 00:42:11.898
How do you start phone sex?

585
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:17.200
Um. okay.

586
00:42:17.235 --> 00:42:19.675
What am I wearing?

587
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:22.645
I don't know.
Probably a pair of underpants.

588
00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.405
Okay. let's not
call them underpants.

589
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.681
That's not sexy at all.

590
00:42:25.716 --> 00:42:29.718
Okay. what are you wearing?

591
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:35.317
- I'd rather not say.
- Just say it.

592
00:42:35.352 --> 00:42:37.627
I'm wearing my favorite
pair of overalls.

593
00:42:37.662 --> 00:42:39.420
No. No. no. no. no. No.

594
00:42:39.455 --> 00:42:40.663
Leif. come on.

595
00:42:40.698 --> 00:42:43.028
I still wear
the same overalls

596
00:42:43.063 --> 00:42:44.502
that I wore when
we were together.

597
00:42:44.537 --> 00:42:47.032
Okay. don't say overalls.
You're ruining it.

598
00:42:47.067 --> 00:42:49.232
Okay. okay.
I'm wearing pants.

599
00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:50.937
Oh. you're so bad at this.

600
00:42:50.972 --> 00:42:56.844
Okay. I'm lying down now.
Are you touching me?

601
00:42:56.879 --> 00:42:58.879
Yes. I am. Very softly.

602
00:42:58.914 --> 00:43:00.683
So soft.
you could barely feel me.

603
00:43:00.718 --> 00:43:03.246
- No. rough.
- Rough. that's exactly what I was saying.

604
00:43:03.281 --> 00:43:06.590
I started soft. but then I went so
rough. like an animal.

605
00:43:06.625 --> 00:43:11.221
Okay. um. why don't you
take your pants off?

606
00:43:11.256 --> 00:43:14.257
You mean my overalls? Because it
is a whole thing to take these off.

607
00:43:14.292 --> 00:43:16.061
Stop saying overalls.

608
00:43:16.096 --> 00:43:17.392
Unless they're like...

609
00:43:17.427 --> 00:43:19.262
are they like fireman
overalls or something?

610
00:43:19.297 --> 00:43:22.265
Yeah. they're...
they're exactly like firemen.

611
00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.805
Well. I can tell
you're lying.

612
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.708
so I want you to just
take your pants off.

613
00:43:25.743 --> 00:43:27.468
Now. Ready. go.

614
00:43:27.503 --> 00:43:30.713
You're the boss.

615
00:43:30.748 --> 00:43:32.275
Do I narrate it
or just do it

616
00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:33.914
and then come back
and talk to you?

617
00:43:33.949 --> 00:43:36.719
- Leif. come on.
- I'm just going to start.

618
00:43:36.754 --> 00:43:38.248
The shirt's coming off.

619
00:43:38.283 --> 00:43:42.285
Okay? Give me one second.

620
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.660
Well. are you taking
your pants off?

621
00:43:43.695 --> 00:43:45.596
I can hit it.
Fucking one-button. man.

622
00:43:45.631 --> 00:43:48.324
Wait.

623
00:43:49.327 --> 00:43:50.766
Wait.

624
00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:56.299
I'm totally naked.

625
00:43:56.334 --> 00:44:01.304
I am rubbing you down hard.

626
00:44:01.339 --> 00:44:04.109
You're covered in oil.

627
00:44:04.144 --> 00:44:08.311
I just got off a shift
and I'm a fucking fireman.

628
00:44:14.352 --> 00:44:17.859
- Audrey?
- Leif. did you just fucking hang up on me?

629
00:44:17.894 --> 00:44:21.764
Fully accidental if I did.
My phone dropped.

630
00:44:21.799 --> 00:44:23.832
Did you hear anything
about the fireman thing?

631
00:44:23.867 --> 00:44:27.165
I'm going to go
do this by myself.

632
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.530
- It's over?
- It's over.

633
00:44:29.565 --> 00:44:31.136
How could it be over?
It just started.

634
00:44:31.171 --> 00:44:34.337
- My overalls are half off.
- You blew it.

635
00:44:34.372 --> 00:44:38.143
Hey. will you come up here?

636
00:44:38.178 --> 00:44:40.442
To your dead mom's cabin?

637
00:44:40.477 --> 00:44:42.752
Well. I don't call it
my dead mom's cabin.

638
00:44:42.787 --> 00:44:45.953
but I'm dying to see you.

639
00:44:48.584 --> 00:44:50.551
Um. yeah.

640
00:44:50.586 --> 00:44:51.926
Yeah. I can come up on Friday.

641
00:44:51.961 --> 00:44:53.994
- This Friday?
- Yeah.

642
00:44:54.029 --> 00:44:56.227
Let me check my schedule.
I'm free.

643
00:44:57.835 --> 00:45:01.001
Okay. Okay. Great. yes.

644
00:45:01.036 --> 00:45:03.168
Medium sex
with my ex-boyfriend.

645
00:45:03.203 --> 00:45:04.565
Let's do this.

646
00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.369
Count on it.

647
00:45:06.404 --> 00:45:08.008
But don't count on it
being very long.

648
00:45:08.043 --> 00:45:10.010
I don't want the pressure.

649
00:45:10.045 --> 00:45:11.814
- See you Friday.
- Good night.

650
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:23.023
I'm not going to do what
you think I'm going to do.

651
00:45:23.058 --> 00:45:25.762
but only out of respect
for our relationship.

652
00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.425
In fact.
I need to take a shower.

653
00:45:53.451 --> 00:45:56.221
Hey. that's enough.

654
00:46:02.834 --> 00:46:04.229
Nora. stop it.

655
00:46:04.264 --> 00:46:06.396
What do you want?

656
00:46:09.467 --> 00:46:12.435
Hey! Can I help you?

657
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:14.338
Hey!

658
00:46:36.494 --> 00:46:40.771
Hey! What do you want?

659
00:46:54.952 --> 00:46:56.611
Right.

660
00:46:56.646 --> 00:46:58.987
Who the fuck is this?

661
00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.550
It is Gorka.

662
00:47:01.585 --> 00:47:02.925
Why are you yelling at me?

663
00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.157
Oh. I'm sorry. Gorka.

664
00:47:04.192 --> 00:47:06.929
It's... what's going on?
How are you?

665
00:47:06.964 --> 00:47:08.524
I'm good and I'm bad.
my friend. Listen.

666
00:47:08.559 --> 00:47:10.691
I won't dance around
this subject

667
00:47:10.726 --> 00:47:13.133
because I have
too much respect for you.

668
00:47:13.168 --> 00:47:14.695
I've known you
for too many years.

669
00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:16.840
too many roads.
too many bus tours.

670
00:47:16.875 --> 00:47:18.908
Too many girls. too many bands.
too many stories we share.

671
00:47:18.943 --> 00:47:21.944
You're dancing around the subject.
What's up. Gorka?

672
00:47:21.979 --> 00:47:25.244
The band wants you out
and I can't believe it.

673
00:47:25.279 --> 00:47:28.148
- What?
- It's not personal.

674
00:47:28.183 --> 00:47:30.348
It's just your style.
your energy.

675
00:47:30.383 --> 00:47:33.351
your vibe.
and your personality doesn't fit in.

676
00:47:33.386 --> 00:47:37.520
My personality. Gorka?
How is that not personal?

677
00:47:37.555 --> 00:47:40.160
- It's my personality.
- Also the fact that you're older

678
00:47:40.195 --> 00:47:43.900
than the rest of the band members by.
like. 20 years. and you play the bongos.

679
00:47:43.935 --> 00:47:45.836
I'm a percussionist.
I don't just play bongos.

680
00:47:45.871 --> 00:47:47.728
Well. you favor
the bongos too much.

681
00:47:47.763 --> 00:47:49.532
Fuck off. Gorka.

682
00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:51.974
I don't favor bongos too much.

683
00:47:52.009 --> 00:47:54.504
Maybe it's not cool to have
an older bongo player.

684
00:47:54.539 --> 00:47:58.343
I'm sorry. man.
First your mom and now this.

685
00:47:58.378 --> 00:48:00.642
You're on a shitty
roll of luck.

686
00:48:00.677 --> 00:48:04.679
Yeah. I'm on a pretty shitty
roll of luck. Gorka.

687
00:48:04.714 --> 00:48:07.253
Well. I have more bad news.

688
00:48:07.288 --> 00:48:09.750
Your cabin at
the back of my property

689
00:48:09.785 --> 00:48:12.863
is deemed an illegal
additional dwelling unit.

690
00:48:12.898 --> 00:48:15.129
What does that mean?

691
00:48:15.164 --> 00:48:17.692
Well. it means we have
to tear down your little hut.

692
00:48:17.727 --> 00:48:20.761
Oh. Don't do this right now.

693
00:48:20.796 --> 00:48:23.566
Hey. maybe we could pull it
apart and make a bonfire.

694
00:48:23.601 --> 00:48:25.909
like a farewell
to this time of ours.

695
00:48:25.944 --> 00:48:28.912
Maybe it's a good thing.
Maybe it's a sign that we have to move on.

696
00:48:28.947 --> 00:48:31.343
I mean. look.
you have a new cabin now.

697
00:48:31.378 --> 00:48:33.543
Why don't you just live there?
You will be fine.

698
00:48:33.578 --> 00:48:37.217
Hey. Gorka. is this. um...

699
00:48:37.252 --> 00:48:38.614
is this because Nora bit you?

700
00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:41.782
No. Not even a little.
No. no.

701
00:48:41.817 --> 00:48:44.224
Because I apologized about that
and it's not going to happen again.

702
00:48:44.259 --> 00:48:45.995
And it was my fault.
She shouldn't have been off-leash.

703
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:50.098
It's not. I've forgiven
your dog for mauling me.

704
00:48:51.827 --> 00:48:53.398
Uh. all good?

705
00:48:53.433 --> 00:48:55.400
Do you have
anything else to say?

706
00:48:55.435 --> 00:48:58.106
What else is there to say?

707
00:48:58.141 --> 00:49:02.242
Okay. I'm sorry. man.

708
00:49:02.277 --> 00:49:06.015
- Bye.
- Yeah.

709
00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:07.445
Talk soon.

710
00:49:14.652 --> 00:49:15.860
Hmm.

711
00:49:22.297 --> 00:49:25.067
Hey. Gorka.

712
00:49:25.102 --> 00:49:27.630
Dawn. he's out.
Got rid of grandpa.

713
00:49:27.665 --> 00:49:30.666
- Yes! You're the best.
- Okay. bye.

714
00:49:33.671 --> 00:49:36.078
That's on you. 100%.

715
00:49:36.113 --> 00:49:37.673
You bit him
and you fucked us.

716
00:49:39.479 --> 00:49:41.644
You know what people
call a dog that bites?

717
00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:44.614
A biting dog asshole.

718
00:49:44.649 --> 00:49:47.892
And that's how you're acting.

719
00:49:57.893 --> 00:49:59.497
Fuck!

720
00:50:28.924 --> 00:50:30.935
What the fuck?

721
00:50:42.146 --> 00:50:43.706
Sometimes life is messy.

722
00:50:43.741 --> 00:50:44.905
It doesn't go as you planned.

723
00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:47.908
but you can't wallow in that.

724
00:50:47.943 --> 00:50:49.349
There's no time.

725
00:50:49.384 --> 00:50:50.713
You need to suck it up

726
00:50:50.748 --> 00:50:52.484
and pick up the pieces
and rebuild.

727
00:50:55.555 --> 00:50:57.720
It's like your music. Leif.

728
00:50:57.755 --> 00:50:59.920
Your career hasn't gone
exactly as planned.

729
00:50:59.955 --> 00:51:01.966
but it's not over.

730
00:51:04.003 --> 00:51:08.731
Um. how do I say this?

731
00:51:08.766 --> 00:51:13.274
Leif. you just
think too much in your art.

732
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:15.045
You're so fucking scared
of what people

733
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:20.050
are going to say or think
and it's killing you.

734
00:51:20.085 --> 00:51:24.153
So this is my request.

735
00:51:24.188 --> 00:51:29.554
I want you to play a song
just for me.

736
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:31.820
Play it from your heart.

737
00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:34.394
Don't worry about if it's good or
bad or any of that kind of stuff.

738
00:51:34.429 --> 00:51:38.728
Just do it for me because you
fucking love to make music.

739
00:51:38.763 --> 00:51:42.435
I promise I'll be listening.

740
00:52:04.019 --> 00:52:06.426
You know.
I'm a shitty painter. Okay.

741
00:52:06.461 --> 00:52:09.429
But I'm also great
because I paint for myself.

742
00:52:09.464 --> 00:52:11.200
I paint because I love it.

743
00:52:14.172 --> 00:52:15.534
And that's what
you've forgotten.

744
00:52:15.569 --> 00:52:18.999
You forgot that
you love your music.

745
00:52:31.717 --> 00:52:33.453
Yeah. I was just jamming.

746
00:52:33.488 --> 00:52:35.455
It was really fucking awesome.

747
00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:36.819
And it made me think
that I don't need to be

748
00:52:36.854 --> 00:52:38.623
in a band called Restaurant.

749
00:52:38.658 --> 00:52:40.526
What I need to do
is make my own music.

750
00:52:40.561 --> 00:52:42.264
And so I feel really
thankful to Honey.

751
00:52:42.299 --> 00:52:43.628
You know. I never
would have got there. but...

752
00:52:43.663 --> 00:52:44.827
Leif. I'm not going to...

753
00:52:44.862 --> 00:52:46.268
I'm not going to come up.

754
00:52:46.303 --> 00:52:48.336
- What?
- To the cabin.

755
00:52:48.371 --> 00:52:51.306
I'm not going to come.

756
00:52:51.341 --> 00:52:53.473
Why not?
What are you talking about?

757
00:52:53.508 --> 00:52:55.475
I just... I can't do this.

758
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:58.038
I can't do this with you.
You're not just a hook-up to me.

759
00:52:58.073 --> 00:53:00.040
Oh. come on. Aud.
I could be a hook-up.

760
00:53:00.075 --> 00:53:02.482
I'll be a hook-up this trip.
Just come.

761
00:53:02.517 --> 00:53:06.849
- Shut up. Leif. please.
- Just come. Look. this is a celebration. remember?

762
00:53:06.884 --> 00:53:09.654
- My mother's dead.
- Listen. I like you is the thing.

763
00:53:09.689 --> 00:53:12.393
I like you so much.

764
00:53:12.428 --> 00:53:17.057
I'm going through a brutal
break-up and it's painful.

765
00:53:17.092 --> 00:53:18.762
I don't know.
I don't want to lead you on

766
00:53:18.797 --> 00:53:21.666
and then disappoint you.
which is what would happen.

767
00:53:21.701 --> 00:53:25.274
You know?
So. I'm not going to come up. Leif.

768
00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:26.506
I just... I can't.

769
00:53:26.541 --> 00:53:28.310
Okay.

770
00:53:28.345 --> 00:53:30.675
Okay.

771
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:32.545
Okay.

772
00:53:34.912 --> 00:53:36.714
Okay. great.

773
00:53:40.357 --> 00:53:41.917
I'm going to go.

774
00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.132
Unless you have
anything else to say.

775
00:53:50.059 --> 00:53:51.333
I don't know what else

776
00:53:51.368 --> 00:53:56.701
to. um... to say. Audrey.

777
00:53:56.736 --> 00:53:59.341
Okay.

778
00:53:59.376 --> 00:54:00.342
Yeah. I guess that's it.

779
00:54:00.377 --> 00:54:02.905
I hope that. um...

780
00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:04.907
look. it was really nice to...
I hope you...

781
00:54:04.942 --> 00:54:07.107
Um. I'm going to go. okay?

782
00:54:07.142 --> 00:54:08.350
Okay.

783
00:54:10.387 --> 00:54:11.716
Bye.

784
00:54:11.751 --> 00:54:14.818
Yeah. good. um...
have a great life.

785
00:54:18.153 --> 00:54:19.295
Okay.

786
00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:20.956
Bye.

787
00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.601
Mother... fuck.

788
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:37.412
Nora. come on.
We're going for a walk.

789
00:54:37.447 --> 00:54:40.184
Fine. I'll go alone.

790
00:55:39.036 --> 00:55:40.475
Hey. Nora?

791
00:55:42.677 --> 00:55:44.446
Nora?

792
00:55:45.548 --> 00:55:50.551
Nora? Nora?

793
00:55:50.586 --> 00:55:51.981
Nora!

794
00:55:54.557 --> 00:55:56.788
Come on. girl!
Where are you? Nora!

795
00:55:56.823 --> 00:55:59.087
Nora!

796
00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:01.529
Nora!

797
00:56:03.467 --> 00:56:07.403
Nora! Come here. girl. Nora!

798
00:56:07.438 --> 00:56:10.703
Nora? Nora!

799
00:56:10.738 --> 00:56:14.872
Nora! Come on. girl!

800
00:56:17.877 --> 00:56:18.876
Fuck!

801
00:56:29.724 --> 00:56:30.954
Bridgeport police.

802
00:56:30.989 --> 00:56:32.252
Yeah. I'd like to report
a missing dog.

803
00:56:32.287 --> 00:56:34.221
maybe a stolen dog.

804
00:56:34.256 --> 00:56:36.091
- Hold please.
- Can you please just...

805
00:56:38.535 --> 00:56:42.064
Whew. okay.

806
00:56:42.099 --> 00:56:46.068
- Bridgeport Police.
- Hi. I'd like to... is this the same person?

807
00:56:46.103 --> 00:56:47.707
No. sir.
this is someone else.

808
00:56:47.742 --> 00:56:51.205
I would like to report my...
my dog is missing.

809
00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.548
Or stolen. I don't know.
I think stolen.

810
00:56:53.583 --> 00:56:55.715
There's a man in a yellow jacket
who stole my dog. so...

811
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:58.817
- and I know his address.
- Okay. What's his name. sir?

812
00:56:58.852 --> 00:57:02.150
I do not know his name.
I have not seen his face.

813
00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:03.888
All I know is that he's been
in a yellow jacket.

814
00:57:03.923 --> 00:57:06.286
and I know it's him
because yesterday

815
00:57:06.321 --> 00:57:09.058
I accidentally
broke into his house

816
00:57:09.093 --> 00:57:10.092
and that really
pissed him off.

817
00:57:10.127 --> 00:57:11.533
You broke into his house?

818
00:57:11.568 --> 00:57:13.733
Well. I didn't
technically break in.

819
00:57:13.768 --> 00:57:16.736
My mother gave me the key.
Okay? My mom is dead.

820
00:57:16.771 --> 00:57:19.409
- Okay.
- And she made a list. and I had to do the list.

821
00:57:19.444 --> 00:57:23.303
And on the list I had to break into
this man with the yellow jacket's house

822
00:57:23.338 --> 00:57:25.074
and leave a note
on his bed. okay?

823
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:27.241
I would like you to send
a patrol car there.

824
00:57:27.276 --> 00:57:30.310
And if the dog is not there. I would
like you to ask him some questions.

825
00:57:30.345 --> 00:57:31.652
Okay. What did you say
his name was?

826
00:57:31.687 --> 00:57:33.918
I don't know
the fucking man's name!

827
00:57:33.953 --> 00:57:35.491
We're going in circles here.

828
00:57:35.526 --> 00:57:38.857
He put two dead rabbits
on my fucking hood!

829
00:57:38.892 --> 00:57:41.321
He stole your
rabbits as well.

830
00:57:41.356 --> 00:57:43.565
He did...
they're not my rabbits!

831
00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.995
Sir. I'm going to need you
to calm down.

832
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:46.502
You know what's
gonna happen. sir?

833
00:57:46.537 --> 00:57:48.966
Is I'm gonna go to
this fucking guy's house.

834
00:57:49.001 --> 00:57:51.133
- Uh. sir?
- And then you're gonna have two dead rabbits.

835
00:57:51.168 --> 00:57:53.135
- a fucking dead dog...
- Watch your language.

836
00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:55.302
...and a fucking dead man
on your hands.

837
00:57:57.581 --> 00:58:00.879
- Hold. please.
- Don't put me on ho... oh!

838
00:58:11.386 --> 00:58:14.156
Nora! Nora!

839
00:58:14.191 --> 00:58:18.028
Hey. if you're in here. man.
I want my dog back!

840
00:58:18.063 --> 00:58:20.030
I'm not fucking around!

841
00:58:20.065 --> 00:58:22.967
Nora!

842
00:58:23.002 --> 00:58:26.806
Nora. I am here. Make a sound
and I'll come get you.

843
00:58:26.841 --> 00:58:28.742
If he's near. I'll kill him.

844
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:38.246
Okay. "If you have my dog.

845
00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:40.952
no questions asked."

846
00:58:40.987 --> 00:58:44.318
Okay. "If you have my dog..."

847
00:58:44.353 --> 00:58:47.893
"I'm the predator.
not the prey."

848
00:58:51.866 --> 00:58:52.931
Okay.

849
00:59:13.525 --> 00:59:15.426
Nora?

850
00:59:22.424 --> 00:59:23.698
Nora?

851
01:00:42.977 --> 01:00:44.504
- Hey. fuck boy.
- Aah! Fuck!

852
01:00:44.539 --> 01:00:46.946
Back! Back! What the fuck
did I ever do to you?

853
01:00:46.981 --> 01:00:48.948
- What do you want from me?
- I want to slice you open

854
01:00:48.983 --> 01:00:51.313
and watch your fucking guts
spill out. sugar dick.

855
01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:53.183
Why are you fucking with me?

856
01:00:53.218 --> 01:00:54.514
I think you've
got that backwards.

857
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:56.516
You're the one
who stole my dog. man.

858
01:00:56.551 --> 01:00:58.485
If you did. just please give
her back and then this is over.

859
01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.729
I don't know anything
about a fucking dog.

860
01:01:00.764 --> 01:01:02.962
And you're the one that's
been messing with me. okay?

861
01:01:02.997 --> 01:01:04.700
You fucking broke into
my house first. remember?

862
01:01:04.735 --> 01:01:06.570
Well. yes. I do. There's
an explanation for that.

863
01:01:06.605 --> 01:01:09.529
- Oh. please.
- I was doing Honey's list. okay?

864
01:01:09.564 --> 01:01:12.466
She told me to go in and leave the
note on your pillow. That's it.

865
01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:15.744
That's how fucking pussy-whipped
you are there. sugar dick?

866
01:01:15.779 --> 01:01:18.142
You just prance your
sweet cheeks all over town

867
01:01:18.177 --> 01:01:20.507
doing whatever the hell
she tells you to. fuck boy?

868
01:01:20.542 --> 01:01:24.984
What the fuck is with your aggressive
compliments. you fucking weirdo. man?

869
01:01:25.019 --> 01:01:27.657
Just so you know.
that's all you're ever gonna be to her.

870
01:01:27.692 --> 01:01:29.549
You're just a little fuck toy
and she's gonna chew you up

871
01:01:29.584 --> 01:01:31.452
and spit you out
when she's done.

872
01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:33.157
Who is gonna do that to me?

873
01:01:33.192 --> 01:01:36.292
Don't fucking play dumb
with me. asshole. Honey!

874
01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:40.571
Honey's my mom.

875
01:01:41.838 --> 01:01:43.673
Like. your actual mother?

876
01:01:45.567 --> 01:01:48.403
She gave birth to you?
Oh. fuck. You're Leif.

877
01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.746
Oh. fu...

878
01:01:52.849 --> 01:01:55.014
Dude. that's hilarious.

879
01:01:55.049 --> 01:01:57.016
So. wait. did she tell you
about our fight. because I...

880
01:01:57.051 --> 01:01:59.821
because listen. there's
two sides to every story.

881
01:01:59.856 --> 01:02:01.658
I'm not the bad guy here.
okay?

882
01:02:01.693 --> 01:02:04.584
I mean. she fucking
stole from me.

883
01:02:04.619 --> 01:02:07.092
Do you not know about Honey?

884
01:02:07.127 --> 01:02:09.765
What about Honey?

885
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.296
Honey's dead. man.

886
01:02:14.332 --> 01:02:15.837
What?

887
01:02:15.872 --> 01:02:18.367
My mother's. uh...
she passed away.

888
01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.974
That's why I'm here.

889
01:02:23.946 --> 01:02:25.781
Honey is dead?

890
01:02:28.247 --> 01:02:29.246
Yes.

891
01:02:31.954 --> 01:02:33.085
How?

892
01:02:34.088 --> 01:02:36.055
Cancer. yes.

893
01:02:38.092 --> 01:02:40.389
Cancer?

894
01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:41.665
Jesus. Honey.

895
01:02:44.263 --> 01:02:45.669
I didn't know.

896
01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:50.674
Oh. fuck. She didn't say
anything about being sick.

897
01:02:53.943 --> 01:02:55.778
Who are you. man?

898
01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:59.474
I'm Carl.

899
01:03:01.918 --> 01:03:05.348
We were... your mom and I
were lovers.

900
01:03:07.726 --> 01:03:10.650
I mean. we were...

901
01:03:10.685 --> 01:03:15.094
on a break
and I thought she...

902
01:03:15.129 --> 01:03:18.933
hooked up with some
young dude to. you know.

903
01:03:18.968 --> 01:03:20.594
just get a little
on the side.

904
01:03:20.629 --> 01:03:23.872
She used to
do that sometimes.

905
01:03:23.907 --> 01:03:27.469
Your mom had quite
an appetite.

906
01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:30.307
Yeah. young guys. threesomes.

907
01:03:30.342 --> 01:03:32.276
I mean. group sex. whatever.

908
01:03:32.311 --> 01:03:35.114
Oral. anal.
I mean. she did it all.

909
01:03:35.149 --> 01:03:39.118
She was a very.
very sexual animal.

910
01:03:39.153 --> 01:03:41.582
and that's probably not what
her son wants to hear. I guess.

911
01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:44.519
- Sorry.
- No problem.

912
01:03:47.359 --> 01:03:51.130
Oh. fuck.

913
01:03:51.165 --> 01:03:56.905
God. I... I feel like I'm fucking
made out of clay or something here.

914
01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:00.942
Oh. God.
I might pass out.

915
01:04:00.977 --> 01:04:05.177
- Could I get a water?
- Yeah. of course. I'll grab you a water.

916
01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:35.570
You okay?

917
01:04:41.182 --> 01:04:42.379
Coming.

918
01:04:49.784 --> 01:04:51.586
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

919
01:05:04.007 --> 01:05:05.732
That's a lot of water. man.

920
01:05:05.767 --> 01:05:07.778
Thanks.

921
01:05:11.476 --> 01:05:15.016
We had a fight. me and Honey.

922
01:05:17.416 --> 01:05:19.614
I mean. she stole from me and...

923
01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:24.894
It seemed so important
at the time.

924
01:05:26.964 --> 01:05:28.392
God. I got so fucking mad.

925
01:05:28.427 --> 01:05:33.232
I... I said terrible
things to her.

926
01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:37.764
I called my dog
a biting asshole

927
01:05:37.799 --> 01:05:40.437
before she disappeared.

928
01:05:42.947 --> 01:05:44.441
Well. your mom was...

929
01:05:44.476 --> 01:05:46.608
I called her
some bad shit. too.

930
01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:50.051
Called her a fucking
thief and rat.

931
01:05:50.086 --> 01:05:52.713
Just...

932
01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:55.419
she really loved you. Leif.

933
01:05:55.454 --> 01:05:59.819
I mean. it tore her apart

934
01:05:59.854 --> 01:06:01.458
that she left you.

935
01:06:01.493 --> 01:06:05.836
That was her
big regret in life.

936
01:06:07.664 --> 01:06:10.137
And it broke her heart that...

937
01:06:10.172 --> 01:06:13.140
you didn't want anything to
do with her after you grew up.

938
01:06:13.175 --> 01:06:18.310
I mean. maybe
she deserved forgiveness.

939
01:06:20.842 --> 01:06:24.448
People who love each other
should be together.

940
01:06:24.483 --> 01:06:26.153
That's the bottom line.

941
01:06:26.188 --> 01:06:30.454
I mean. time together

942
01:06:30.489 --> 01:06:32.126
is what matters.

943
01:06:34.933 --> 01:06:36.999
And now it's too late.

944
01:06:38.893 --> 01:06:42.466
It's too late
for both of us.

945
01:06:42.501 --> 01:06:43.973
You know?
We fucking blew it.

946
01:06:44.008 --> 01:06:45.040
Shame on us.

947
01:06:49.343 --> 01:06:50.870
I can't be here anymore.

948
01:06:50.905 --> 01:06:53.873
It smells like her here.
you know?

949
01:06:53.908 --> 01:06:56.777
I can feel her.

950
01:06:59.914 --> 01:07:01.650
I love you. Honey.

951
01:07:02.917 --> 01:07:06.094
And I'm gonna miss you.

952
01:07:08.428 --> 01:07:12.331
Oh. God. I'm gonna miss
your smile and your...

953
01:07:12.366 --> 01:07:13.530
your eyes.

954
01:07:18.141 --> 01:07:19.767
Your mind.

955
01:07:21.276 --> 01:07:23.342
Your sense of humor.

956
01:07:23.377 --> 01:07:26.444
The taste of your vagina
in the morning.

957
01:07:28.943 --> 01:07:30.217
I'm gonna miss all of it.

958
01:07:32.947 --> 01:07:34.551
I'm gonna miss you.
sweet girl.

959
01:07:38.161 --> 01:07:40.920
I'll miss you every day...

960
01:07:40.955 --> 01:07:43.593
for the rest of my days.

961
01:07:49.568 --> 01:07:51.403
Well...

962
01:07:56.971 --> 01:07:58.575
I'll get out of your hair.

963
01:08:00.447 --> 01:08:02.546
If you decide to stick around.

964
01:08:02.581 --> 01:08:07.386
um. you know. you can come by
my place any time you want.

965
01:08:07.421 --> 01:08:10.752
We could. I don't know.

966
01:08:10.787 --> 01:08:13.953
go fishing or something.

967
01:08:13.988 --> 01:08:15.790
Tell you a lot of stories
about your mom.

968
01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:18.001
That'd be great.

969
01:08:19.664 --> 01:08:23.303
I'll keep an eye open
for your dog. too.

970
01:08:23.338 --> 01:08:27.010
That'd be amazing
if something happened with that.

971
01:08:27.045 --> 01:08:30.805
Dogs have a way of reappearing
on this mountain.

972
01:08:32.446 --> 01:08:33.808
I hope so.

973
01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:03.310
Nora?

974
01:09:06.546 --> 01:09:09.448
Nora?

975
01:09:09.483 --> 01:09:10.845
Come on. girl.

976
01:09:27.303 --> 01:09:28.863
Nora?

977
01:09:49.226 --> 01:09:50.918
This is the last one.

978
01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:55.791
and then we're done.

979
01:09:57.894 --> 01:10:00.400
It's called Green Lake.

980
01:10:00.435 --> 01:10:03.062
It is my favorite spot.

981
01:10:03.097 --> 01:10:05.900
It is so beautiful it hurts.

982
01:10:09.103 --> 01:10:10.872
I'm gonna miss it.

983
01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:13.072
Anyway.
you're gonna hike there.

984
01:10:13.107 --> 01:10:15.316
and it's not an easy hike.

985
01:10:15.351 --> 01:10:18.517
so make sure you have on
good shoes.

986
01:10:18.552 --> 01:10:20.321
There's a red backpack
in the garage

987
01:10:20.356 --> 01:10:22.455
labeled "Green Lake."

988
01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.953
Now there's
some supplies in there

989
01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:27.889
and there's a map
in the front compartment.

990
01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:31.530
You'll need that. definitely.
Don't open anything else.

991
01:10:31.565 --> 01:10:35.105
Just get the map
and follow the instructions.

992
01:10:55.325 --> 01:10:58.117
Enjoy the hike.
I took it many times.

993
01:10:58.152 --> 01:11:02.330
Countless times.
And I always thought of you.

994
01:11:02.365 --> 01:11:06.829
When I was missing you.
I went here.

995
01:11:22.616 --> 01:11:24.253
I always hoped
you'd call me back

996
01:11:24.288 --> 01:11:26.387
and we'd come to this lake
together one day.

997
01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:33.856
It's marked on the map.
You can't miss it.

998
01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:50.213
Yeah.

999
01:12:04.592 --> 01:12:06.020
I made it.

1000
01:12:08.596 --> 01:12:10.662
It's really not
that green though.

1001
01:12:10.697 --> 01:12:15.403
Now. under the big tree
you'll find a box.

1002
01:12:15.438 --> 01:12:17.537
It's my ashes.

1003
01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:49.404
Once you find it.
read the letter that's in the backpack.

1004
01:12:50.704 --> 01:12:54.167
All right.

1005
01:12:54.202 --> 01:12:59.238
"My name is Leif.
My mother loved me.

1006
01:12:59.273 --> 01:13:02.681
I wish she was different
than who she was.

1007
01:13:02.716 --> 01:13:05.145
I hated that she left me.

1008
01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.850
and I was never willing

1009
01:13:06.885 --> 01:13:09.358
to listen to anything
she had to say

1010
01:13:09.393 --> 01:13:11.855
because I thought
she was a kook.

1011
01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:14.858
and maybe she was.

1012
01:13:14.893 --> 01:13:17.256
But now my mother is dead.

1013
01:13:17.291 --> 01:13:20.468
and I am at a lake
with no mother.

1014
01:13:20.503 --> 01:13:25.066
and she wants me
to say these words.

1015
01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:28.069
'I love you. Mom.

1016
01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:30.511
I forgive you.

1017
01:13:30.546 --> 01:13:32.711
It's time for me to move on
with my life

1018
01:13:32.746 --> 01:13:35.076
and be successful.

1019
01:13:35.111 --> 01:13:38.915
I will be dead soon.
So will everyone.

1020
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:43.282
So will the planet if those
motherfuckers in government

1021
01:13:43.317 --> 01:13:46.120
don't start taking
global warming seriously.

1022
01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:49.123
Fucking pricks!
Money whores.'"

1023
01:13:54.768 --> 01:13:56.900
That's great.

1024
01:13:56.935 --> 01:13:59.738
"Now eulogize me
in your own words

1025
01:13:59.773 --> 01:14:02.444
and scatter my ashes.
Don't spill me."

1026
01:14:07.781 --> 01:14:10.518
I wish I had something
great to say. Honey.

1027
01:14:10.553 --> 01:14:14.115
and I had a lot of feelings.

1028
01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:19.087
But I think my biggest regret is that
we didn't spend any time together.

1029
01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:20.924
I just don't know you
and you don't...

1030
01:14:20.959 --> 01:14:21.958
Heya!

1031
01:14:24.501 --> 01:14:25.599
Hi.

1032
01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.371
Beautiful spot.

1033
01:14:29.803 --> 01:14:33.134
Yeah. it's...
it was my mother's favorite.

1034
01:14:34.973 --> 01:14:37.941
- Okay. Bye now.
- Okay.

1035
01:14:37.976 --> 01:14:39.173
Bye now.

1036
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:47.148
What the fuck?

1037
01:14:47.183 --> 01:14:48.820
Rest in peace. Honey.

1038
01:15:00.031 --> 01:15:01.030
Okay.

1039
01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.541
Whoa.

1040
01:15:06.576 --> 01:15:07.575
All right.

1041
01:16:31.595 --> 01:16:32.957
Aah!

1042
01:16:52.143 --> 01:16:54.044
Oh. shit.

1043
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:17.358
Okay. you learned
what I needed to teach you.

1044
01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:19.558
You let out your emotions.

1045
01:18:19.593 --> 01:18:22.165
you rekindled your love.

1046
01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.904
and you became the predator.

1047
01:18:24.939 --> 01:18:29.370
Those lessons are what I learned to
be most important on this planet.

1048
01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:33.473
So now.
you've learned it from me.

1049
01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:36.542
And. yeah. okay. they're
from the Habata trinity

1050
01:18:36.577 --> 01:18:38.082
and I know you hate
that shit.

1051
01:18:38.117 --> 01:18:39.578
but I did get some good
out of those years

1052
01:18:39.613 --> 01:18:41.184
before they fucked me over.

1053
01:18:41.219 --> 01:18:43.186
And anyway.
it's too expensive to sue.

1054
01:18:43.221 --> 01:18:45.056
so. yeah. that's that.

1055
01:18:47.291 --> 01:18:51.194
Now. obviously I have no way to
prove you did the list or not.

1056
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:54.329
There's no lie detector
or anything insane like that.

1057
01:18:54.364 --> 01:18:57.431
But I do hope you did it. Leif.
because it's meant to help.

1058
01:18:59.842 --> 01:19:02.601
I want for you to experience
the best of this life. Leif.

1059
01:19:02.636 --> 01:19:04.944
That's all I ever wanted.

1060
01:19:04.979 --> 01:19:07.683
And most importantly.

1061
01:19:07.718 --> 01:19:11.577
to feel everything
along the way.

1062
01:19:26.264 --> 01:19:27.626
Nora!

1063
01:19:27.661 --> 01:19:29.903
Oh!

1064
01:19:32.666 --> 01:19:36.239
Oh. Oh.

1065
01:19:43.677 --> 01:19:46.612
I'm sorry
I said that about you.

1066
01:20:08.504 --> 01:20:10.273
You did it. kid.

1067
01:20:10.308 --> 01:20:14.948
Whoa! You finished the list.
The cabin is all yours.

1068
01:20:14.983 --> 01:20:18.919
Or maybe you didn't and then I've
just been wasting my fucking time.

1069
01:20:18.954 --> 01:20:22.450
But if you did.
I'm so proud of you.

1070
01:20:22.485 --> 01:20:24.287
I hope you had a fun time.

1071
01:20:24.322 --> 01:20:26.454
It means a lot to me.

1072
01:20:26.489 --> 01:20:29.292
By the way. those were not
my real ashes. of course.

1073
01:20:29.327 --> 01:20:31.690
When you think about it.
it's not logical. right?

1074
01:20:31.725 --> 01:20:34.495
I mean. I hid the backpack.
I hid the box.

1075
01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:36.497
And also.
I do not weigh 50 pounds.

1076
01:20:36.532 --> 01:20:38.136
and there were not enough
ashes in that.

1077
01:20:38.171 --> 01:20:40.809
But then you probably
figured that out

1078
01:20:40.844 --> 01:20:42.305
because you're such
a little smarty pants.

1079
01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.307
Sadly. I didn't.

1080
01:20:44.342 --> 01:20:47.145
Now this last bit
is important.

1081
01:20:49.347 --> 01:20:51.545
You have to move on
with your life.

1082
01:20:52.746 --> 01:20:54.548
What happened to you

1083
01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:57.320
is not what's
happening to you.

1084
01:20:57.355 --> 01:21:00.059
Your past does not dictate
your future.

1085
01:21:01.557 --> 01:21:04.162
Life is so short.

1086
01:21:04.197 --> 01:21:06.967
Try having some more fun.

1087
01:21:07.002 --> 01:21:08.529
And be kind.

1088
01:21:11.204 --> 01:21:16.405
I love you
with all my heart.

1089
01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:19.573
I'm so sorry that I wasn't
better at showing that to you.

1090
01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:24.215
I fucked up.
I just fucked up and it was my fault.

1091
01:21:25.779 --> 01:21:28.054
I know it.

1092
01:21:28.089 --> 01:21:29.583
I'm sorry.

1093
01:21:32.687 --> 01:21:36.964
Now. I'm hoping
and I believe

1094
01:21:36.999 --> 01:21:41.463
that we will be reunited
again in some dimension.

1095
01:21:41.498 --> 01:21:44.202
- Oh. man.
- I know you don't believe that.

1096
01:21:44.237 --> 01:21:46.809
but you're gonna feel
so stupid when it happens.

1097
01:21:49.077 --> 01:21:51.671
And then.

1098
01:21:51.706 --> 01:21:53.013
maybe we can spend
the time together

1099
01:21:53.048 --> 01:21:57.050
that we didn't in this life.

1100
01:21:58.416 --> 01:22:00.053
I would like that.

1101
01:22:05.456 --> 01:22:09.227
So...

1102
01:22:09.262 --> 01:22:11.064
until then.

1103
01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:12.895
This is a terrible painting.

1104
01:23:16.230 --> 01:23:18.494
And an even worse title.

1105
01:23:25.503 --> 01:23:29.472
I'm gonna miss you. Mom.

1106
01:23:29.507 --> 01:23:31.342
That's for sure.
