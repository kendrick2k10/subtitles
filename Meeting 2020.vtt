00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Hello

4
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.980
Hi! I'm Elisabeth

5
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.276
For the meetup group right? YES!

6
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.276
Nice to meet you come on in.

7
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.480
Such a lovely house

8
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.276
Thank you. It's my mum's actually.

9
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.276
She is out of town.
Doesn't even know that I'm

10
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.276
Oh darling

11
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.276
don't be nervous

12
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.300
it will be fine

13
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.300
could you

14
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.276
do you mind if I just pop to the loo?

15
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.276
Of course sweetheart

16
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.276
No problem I will just

17
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.300
make myself comfortable

18
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.300
How could you do such a thing you idiot?

19
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.276
Oh. I didn't hear the door

20
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.276
Sorry. did you..

21
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.276
Darling this is John

22
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.076
He is a wonderful pianist

23
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.277
I met him at one of my
meetups. where we'd sing songs.

24
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.540
I met him at one of my
meetups. where we'd sing songs.

25
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.280
Right? You two know each other from before?

26
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.980
Hi. It's Can actually. it's a Turkish name

27
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.276
No no no you can call
me John I don't mind it

28
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.276
Oh! Hold on let me get that

29
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.276
This is exciting

30
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.300
people are coming!

31
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.180
Linda!

32
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.557
What was that song you
sang last time with John!

33
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:52.280
Oh. Light Me Up. It's my
boyfriend's composition

34
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.580
Your boyfriend's composition?

35
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.660
I have it!

36
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.740
No way

37
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.300
Way!

38
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.260
Baby

39
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.260
I see you walking past me

40
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.230
But I swear your soul kissed

41
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.330
my eternity

42
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
Hold me

43
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.236
closely

44
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.200
with every touch I'll make you

45
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.660
believe in me

46
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
You killed me

47
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.236
with purity

48
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.230
you separated all the blood in my soul

49
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
light me up

50
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.206
tone me down

51
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.400
moi your palette

52
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.960
vous my song

53
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.600
Your touch illustrates

54
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.900
colors into my skin

55
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.300
Oh. wonderful!

56
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.420
I want to propose a toast

57
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.560
to the lady who brought music to this party

58
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.300
Oh! Thank you

59
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.276
That's why I love organising music groups

60
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.760
you get to sing together

61
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.530
and you have so much fun

62
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.460
This is what young people need
to bear in mind and take away

63
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.920
Music is the way to stay

64
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.277
modest

65
00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:42.816
and humble in this world

66
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.880
I don't want to sound like
the annoying uncle but..

67
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.276
Well. I'm afraid you do

68
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.300
When you generalise
about "all young people"

69
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.630
and then you talk about
modesty and humility

70
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.660
sorry it's just a real bugbear of mine

71
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.276
Sorry

72
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.300
Who are you?

73
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.660
I'm Samantha

74
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.520
Why? Does that make a difference?

75
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.300
Guys. come on

76
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.276
Is that the booze talking?

77
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.300
No. just me being a bitch

78
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.700
Oh. I need to get this sorry

79
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.700
You know honey

80
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.500
I truly believe. that when
one believes enough

81
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.760
there's nothing one can't achieve

82
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.900
"The secret!"

83
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.740
Yes darling! We create our
own destiny with our energy

84
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.276
Look. I'm sorry to interrupt
but can I also state my opinion?

85
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.880
I think all this "energy and believe in it
and let your dreams come true is bullshit"

86
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.560
Of course! It's all about taking selfies
and posting on facebook and instagram.

87
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.780
Not worth chasing your goals

88
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.276
You know that's not my point at all

89
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.000
and I don't take pictures and
post what I eat on instagram

90
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.840
I think these so called "secret" and other cliched
sayings are just as commercial as your examples

91
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.980
What cliche? The girl sings wonderfully and a
living example of what we are all talking about here

92
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.960
The girl doesn't sing at Carnegie Hall.

93
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.660
She sings her boyfriend's
songs at meetup parties.

94
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.220
Oh it's not commercial enough for
you. Whatever happened to simplicity and

95
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.716
I'm not saying those are bad and I don't understand
why everyone's got hostile when I express my opinion

96
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.276
Not everyone

97
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.500
I think these days. just like
on facebook and instagram

98
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.860
people made plastic versions of deep
philosophies and psychological complexities

99
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.180
and then they sell them by
making them sound simple

100
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.820
You know that they are sweet
tricks to attract naive people.

101
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.060
Oh you're making such a big thing of it.

102
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.820
You have quite a big ego don't you?

103
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.800
Shouldn't you be at home reading
books and not wasting time at parties?

104
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.540
I think may be you are right

105
00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.940
Guys.. come on

106
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.180
Well seriously. first we have
"all young people" generalization

107
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.276
now we have this "psychology.
philosophy. I know all that"

108
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.276
I didn't say that

109
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.420
No. but it's obvious
that's what you're thinking

110
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.776
Ok and who are you to judge me like that?

111
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.376
Guys please. can we not spend the whole night
arguing and throwing sass at each other?

112
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.540
Let's show some respect for our host.

113
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.796
Now I'm disrespectful

114
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.276
Seriously I will not have
this anymore at my house

115
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.276
You're right honey don't be sad

116
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.520
why don't we lighten the mood a bit?

117
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.276
I'm not sad

118
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.300
John! Honey. play something for us

119
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.480
No. seriously if I play the
piece I've been practising lately

120
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.276
This party is going to be doomed

121
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.276
Mmm I like the sound of that

122
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.860
It's so difficult. I..

123
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.416
Oh come on honey
this is not a concert hall!

124
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.277
Okay

125
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:49.276
for the sake of changing the mood

126
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.300
I'll give it a go

127
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.456
is anyone gonna tell me what's going on?

128
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.136
Now people go missing?

129
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.980
It's all right darling. I got you!

130
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:29.436
It makes sense

131
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.680
She's fainted

132
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.720
No way?

133
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.100
Do you mind?

134
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.300
Oh fuck! Fuck

135
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:41.460
Jody?

136
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.276
Wait. Jody!

137
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.276
Jody!

138
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.300
JODY!

139
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.920
Jody!

140
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.900
Jody!

141
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.960
Jody wait! Jody stop!

142
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.440
Jody

143
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.300
I'm not going to hurt you

144
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.300
Listen to me

145
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:45.780
Jody

146
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.300
Jody wait!

147
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.300
Jody! wait!

148
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.960
Jody

149
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.900
I know what you're thinking

150
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.316
What?

151
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.780
You know what

152
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.840
What do you want me to say?

153
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.500
I mean You're bloody fainting or whatever

154
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.300
and you wake up on the floor and you are
telling me this is not one of your episodes?

155
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.240
Lara I told you. and I told mum

156
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.296
this wasn't one of those

157
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.776
if you just get in touch with these people

158
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.376
you have it all clear in your
mind. you'll know what happened

159
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.616
Yeah and face the humiliation

160
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.440
what humiliation?

161
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.616
Come on Lara. you know these
people played a prank on me!

162
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.616
Or what are you saying?

163
00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.460
I just passed out and had an
hour long hallucination is that it?

164
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.060
I'm not saying anything and I
told you. don't put this on me

165
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.640
This is not helping

166
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.640
Julie I want to help you

167
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.560
I'm just trying to understand Julie

168
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.640
Ok.

169
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.180
So the way I see it. there's two options

170
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.020
the first. you are right. They played
a huge prank on you. well done them

171
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.617
Second

172
00:13:52.641 --> 00:13:54.640
you know you've been on so much medication

173
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.640
Second! Right. second!

174
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.360
I'm crazy.

175
00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.480
Julie come on

176
00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.616
Don't Julie me. It's
so easy for you isn't it?

177
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.096
I'm trying to help you

178
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.540
I'm not just talking about you. it's
all of you. You. mum. everybody!

179
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.640
You have no idea what
I'm going through do you?

180
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.240
Let go

181
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.616
Give up

182
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.640
You know it's best

183
00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.640
There's a woman upstairs

184
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.776
I told you they are chasing
after me. No one believes me

185
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.000
I'm not making this up

186
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.640
She must have left

187
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.640
Oh...

188
00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.420
Mum. I know that tone.

189
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.640
We both know it don't we?

190
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.040
Can I just...

191
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.396
Mum please

192
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.156
Baby!

193
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.240
Please don't do that!

194
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.640
What have you done to yourself?

195
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.980
My baby!

196
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.180
Why?

197
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.616
I'm giving this to you

198
00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.300
But I'm not letting go of the meaning
and the experience that we shared

199
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.616
I'll keep that forever

200
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.616
and I know you will too

201
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.640
I will

202
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.640
I don't have any words any more

203
00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.280
guess that's the point right?

204
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.316
Shall we hug?

205
00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.640
Thank you

206
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.020
Hi Julianne

207
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.616
thanks for calling

208
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.616
I've got your e mail

209
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.776
I can fit you in at 4 o'clock tomorrow.

210
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.776
4 o'clock tomorrow is fine

211
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.800
Great. I'll see you at my private practise

212
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.680
Ok

213
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.800
Ok. Bye

214
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.720
Bye

215
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.800
Hey!

216
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.800
Hey

217
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.800
I organised this meetup
party for creative people

218
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.140
It just went awfully wrong

219
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.776
They are all after me now

220
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.800
They are trying to kill me

221
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.030
in my dreams

222
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:04.130
but

223
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.800
it just seems so real

224
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:11.380
I'm really scared I'm actually going to die

225
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.800
Did this start about the party?

226
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.600
Your dreams I mean

227
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.800
I've always had trouble with my sleep

228
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.920
sleepwalking.

229
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.800
when half awake. hallucinating

230
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.080
but nothing this extreme

231
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.920
there is something really wrong this time

232
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.200
This woman Elisabeth

233
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.800
and the piano guy John

234
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.780
he played this piece at the party and

235
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.460
everything just went wrong after that

236
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.776
What was it like before this happened?

237
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.800
What kind of people are they?

238
00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.700
They were actually the nicest
and the friendliest ones towards me

239
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.776
I don't understand

240
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.800
That's interesting

241
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:02.776
so they were nice

242
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.776
and now they're your monsters

243
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.800
Yes. They were really supportive

244
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.800
And how are you?

245
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.776
What. now?

246
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.800
Not just now

247
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400
In general

248
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.800
Do you support yourself?

249
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.800
I

250
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:24.800
I

251
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.800
My questions made you sad

252
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.100
I

253
00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.800
I hurt

254
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.776
I've got no choice

255
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.460
I look like this cheerful
and nice person but

256
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.800
I'm this..

257
00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.800
This!

258
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.800
You feel you have no choice.

259
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.800
It helps you to hurt yourself

260
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:06.800
I understand

261
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.480
You do?

262
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.460
Have you seen a therapist before Julianne?

263
00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.840
A psychiatrist..

264
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.220
My mum took me

265
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.540
He said I had bp something.

266
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.800
Borderline? Bipolar?

267
00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.800
Borderline

268
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.800
He was an asshole

269
00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.800
Didn't end well

270
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.776
Ended quite messy actually

271
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.800
Life isn't always beautiful

272
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.330
How do these people kill you?

273
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.800
They strangle me

274
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.580
Can just pushed me to the ground and

275
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.320
Elisabeth caught me off guard

276
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.420
If you see them in your dreams

277
00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.800
they aren't other people

278
00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.800
What do you mean?

279
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.200
You catch yourself off guard

280
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.160
You are strangling yourself

281
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.776
Ok. You are scaring me now.

282
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.800
I don't mean to scare you Julianne

283
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.200
but what you're saying already is scary

284
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.460
Where do these people come from?

285
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.800
Who brings them here?

286
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.220
Oh right. here you go

287
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.776
You know what? You can go to hell

288
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.776
All of you

289
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.560
I don't know why I even bothered

290
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.880
What's wrong Julianne?

291
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.240
What's wrong?

292
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.500
You are wrong

293
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.980
All these people are in my head

294
00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.360
right?

295
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.120
Well good for you. so clever. you nailed it

296
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.220
I don't understand

297
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.100
You won't need to

298
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.540
I don't think you should go like this

299
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.340
Yeah? watch me!

300
00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.880
No

301
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.780
What?

302
00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.060
Who do you think you
are? Get out of my way!

303
00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.740
I'm not getting out of your way
until you manage to stay with me

304
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.060
Don't you fucking shout
at me you crazy bi...

305
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.960
I am not shouting at you because I'm angry

306
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.920
I'm trying to reach you

307
00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.140
What is this?

308
00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.840
You think you can use force to stop me

309
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.800
Look into my eyes. Is that what you see?

310
00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.840
What are you doing?

311
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.100
I'm trying to stay with you Julianne

312
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.280
Why?

313
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.800
Because I think no one else does

314
00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.800
Is my hand all right there?

315
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.180
I don't want to do this

316
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.800
I know

317
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.820
I know it's painful

318
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.776
But I'm here

319
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.800
and I want to be here

320
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.800
In your pain

321
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.560
What happened there

322
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.160
I'm interested in your reaction

323
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.800
Has this happened before?

324
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.020
You have no idea what
I'm going through do you?

325
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.230
Fuck your care! Thanks for
your loving and caring chat

326
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.800
Almost always

327
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:47.920
Right

328
00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.800
You didn't have to be a bitch though

329
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.080
I know

330
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.776
I'm sorry

331
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.800
I had to improvise

332
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.800
I'm not feeling worse

333
00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.120
I won't stay for long

334
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.816
I just want to make
sure you are in one piece

335
00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.240
Mum I don't want to talk about this

336
00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.800
That's why people go to
therapy right? It's private

337
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.080
Oh do they now?

338
00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.520
And what's there to keep
from one's own mother?

339
00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:30.920
Who's worried as hell

340
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.456
and who's getting messages
from her daughter's best friend

341
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.800
that she's worried

342
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.900
All I wanted is for you..

343
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.240
Yeah that's not fair is
it? What do you want..

344
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.800
What do I want ha?

345
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.180
Oh

346
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.800
Did she give you that individualistic crap?

347
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.856
I should have found you a therapist

348
00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.120
Mum can you stop making this about her?

349
00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.500
I just told her what happened and

350
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.040
The party

351
00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.460
Yeah. Not just that

352
00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.800
What do you mean?

353
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.800
Oh

354
00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.240
Did someone leave you Julianne?

355
00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.300
Oh we are not going there

356
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.980
I think we are there

357
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.800
I think you are there all the time

358
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.800
What?

359
00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.800
Do that some more

360
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.500
What? Why?

361
00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.800
Looks like they're doing the talking

362
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.460
They are doing what you're not saying

363
00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.800
I don't want to talk about it

364
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.800
Then don't

365
00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.800
Let your hands do the talking

366
00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.000
Here

367
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.640
Try on this

368
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.800
Come on

369
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.060
Do it some more

370
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.730
How does it feel?

371
00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.940
Stupid

372
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.800
Yes

373
00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.380
What else?

374
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.100
More stupid?

375
00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.020
So say it

376
00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.800
Say it to the stupid cushion. Try

377
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.220
What? Stupid?

378
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:42.860
Yes

379
00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.800
Try it more

380
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.940
But..

381
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.680
Come on Julianne

382
00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.540
Say it

383
00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.800
Let go

384
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.060
Listen to your body

385
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.800
What do you notice?

386
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.580
My back

387
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.800
Stupid

388
00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.240
You're angry Julianne

389
00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.260
You seem angry

390
00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.800
I am angry! I'm fucking angry!

391
00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.060
Yes. Julianne

392
00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.800
I'm with you let go

393
00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:53.600
I can't

394
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.800
I can't

395
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.160
Who is it Julianne?

396
00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:10.800
What the cushion?

397
00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.800
Who left you?

398
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.120
My father

399
00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.360
When?

400
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.120
I never met him

401
00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.800
I'm trying to reach you

402
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.500
You are strangling yourself

403
00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.200
Am I supposed to feel guilty about it now?

404
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.800
How wonderful the way you emphasize the "I"

405
00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.280
No I should

406
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.800
Oh mum please don't
start with the I should haves

407
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.800
What?

408
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.776
You are looking for someone to blame

409
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.776
and you don't want to take it

410
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.776
fine. blame me

411
00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.776
blame me for not burning that bloody letter

412
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.776
Blame me for having you

413
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.800
I chose to understand him

414
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.560
forgive him

415
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.780
No listen. he's a ghost in my life

416
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.420
I mean. you don't talk about him

417
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.280
all I know is that he didn't want me

418
00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.776
and he didn't want you because of me

419
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.776
I think you should stop seeing that woman

420
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.800
I don't want your nose in all this OK?

421
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.800
My nose?

422
00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.040
I'm paying for it

423
00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.340
Yeah

424
00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:34.900
Well listen. I want you out of here

425
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.260
I want it more than you
do. you spoiled little brat

426
00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.800
Go snivel to that so sacred therapist

427
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.800
It's too early to play the jealous card!

428
00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.280
She never drank it did she?

429
00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.600
Leave it

430
00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.776
I was really worried about you

431
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.081
it was an absolute horrow show
you went through you know?

432
00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.800
Yeah

433
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.860
Are you still seeing that therapist?

434
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.800
Yeah I am

435
00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.940
And actually its after seeing
her that I've been feeling different

436
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.800
How long do you have to see her for?

437
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.300
Is there a time when she just
says "darling you're cured"?

438
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.776
It's gonna be a while

439
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.800
I mean we have an open ended contract

440
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.776
And..

441
00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.120
She says " We are at a very
important point in our journey"

442
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.800
Oh yes?

443
00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.140
What?

444
00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.320
Well I know I know it's
private and everything.

445
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.260
but I mean if you wanted to give me any
juicy details on what you guys talk about

446
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.120
Yeah of course

447
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.800
I wouldn't have a stroke telling you

448
00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.800
It just all comes down to mum

449
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.040
I know she'd freak out if she
knew how much she damaged me

450
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.400
but I know she didn't do it intentionally

451
00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:33.020
Yeah. Parents. Constantly
unintentionally fucking things up.

452
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.420
Yep!

453
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.060
So this serious work. tell me. You know.

454
00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.396
what is it she says to you
that actually makes a difference

455
00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.430
it's not so much about what she says

456
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.776
it's more about how she is

457
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.200
she has a way of entering
and touching the core of things

458
00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:55.920
So she touches and enters?

459
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.777
Yeah!

460
00:36:56.801 --> 00:37:00.180
She entered and touched my monsters!

461
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.500
And then.

462
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.420
and only then. can you
learn to love yourself

463
00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.800
Oh yes!

464
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.860
No I mean seriously.

465
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.800
I know we are joking and all.

466
00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:21.860
but

467
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.776
there's something really weird
and unique happening in that room

468
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.800
But you gotta admit it just sounds a bit

469
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:28.777
What?

470
00:37:28.801 --> 00:37:30.776
Well. all of this

471
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.776
going back to your childhood

472
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.960
talking about mother issues

473
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.800
it's not exactly going into your childhood

474
00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.680
I'm realising more and more it's

475
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.776
we're all still in our childhoods. you know

476
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.880
and somewhere along the way we desperately
try and adapt to this adult world

477
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:49.980
at least I am

478
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:54.700
the thing is you can't spend your entire life just
playing around. there has to be some limitation

479
00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.160
Why not?

480
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.880
I mean. if everyone followed their heart

481
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.860
at least we'd have real people

482
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.776
instead of institutionalized zombies

483
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.776
in that party.

484
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.960
Samantha was so bitchy

485
00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.800
I'm not

486
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.380
That piano guy. he was so creative. I'm not

487
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.680
Elisabeth was so kind. I don't deserve it

488
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.740
Jody was upfront. I can't
be seen to be that rude

489
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.776
Who am I in all this?

490
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.776
I need to be myself as well you know?

491
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.776
I see what you're saying but the thing is.

492
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.100
if we were all completely open and
honest with our friends all the time

493
00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.936
some of those friendships
would seize to exist

494
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.620
Exactly! So we need to find a
way to embrace that openness

495
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:44.320
not try and live at this
plastic prison of pretense

496
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.800
Plastic. I like that

497
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:48.937
All right girls?

498
00:38:48.961 --> 00:38:50.080
Hello darling

499
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.800
Don't mind me I'm just off to the gym

500
00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.320
Enjoy your play date

501
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.800
Bay baay

502
00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.060
So where were we?

503
00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.260
Something about plastic people?

504
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.180
Yeah I mean

505
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.440
I feel like I need to

506
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.800
I need to reset and start from scratch

507
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.800
But I feel so fragile

508
00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.776
when you let go of your
habitual ways it's like

509
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.280
you turn into a baby who
is acidentally a 25 year old

510
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.720
It's meeting your true self that's
so painful and sometimes awkward.

511
00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.800
That's when Carol nurtures me

512
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.600
that's when she stays compassionate
and firm at the same time

513
00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.000
man that's deep

514
00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.800
Yeah. It is

515
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.760
Hi Peter it's Carol

516
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.800
So.

517
00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:14.120
sitting here I..

518
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.780
Am very much left with our last meeting

519
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.800
and with

520
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.060
Julianne

521
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.776
Yes

522
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.620
I was a bit defensive last
time we spoke about her

523
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.800
I'm sure that you were concerned

524
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.800
So please.

525
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.700
tell me more about Julianne

526
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:47.740
well she started to self harm
when she found her father's letter

527
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.720
but I feel the root of her problems
stems way back to her mother's depression

528
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.800
when Julianne was a baby

529
00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.020
she grew up with guilt

530
00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.180
a sense that she owed
her existence to her mother.

531
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.800
Who chose Julianne after her father

532
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.116
a party mirrored her
projections of her real self

533
00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.140
A party?

534
00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.400
Yes

535
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.540
Her projections began to haunt her.

536
00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.776
As if they were going to
kill her. but in actual fact..

537
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.180
I see where you're going with this Carol

538
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.060
but it's just the way you talk about her

539
00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:32.120
there is something unsettling for me here

540
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:40.720
is there some particular pull or
confluence for you with Julliane

541
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.936
in terms of your own unfinished business?

542
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.400
My miscarriage

543
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:55.060
I'm concerned that your longing for your lost girl
is getting in the way of your ethical practise Carol

544
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.377
Yes

545
00:41:56.401 --> 00:41:58.800
I am longing for my lost girl

546
00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.800
but it doesn't affect my work

547
00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:05.140
I think it does Carol

548
00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:11.640
it's clear to me that you are unable to gauge
appropriate interventions with this client

549
00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:19.480
I think you are too sensitive to carry
on working with Julianne at this stage.

550
00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:23.140
Especially with her alarming situtation

551
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.840
I will have to consult with
the ethics comitee about this

552
00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.630
You must understand

553
00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.776
He's just being a jerk

554
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.776
I don't blame him totally

555
00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.776
It's a miysterious field

556
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.800
unlike medicine

557
00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.880
Yeah I hear what you are saying

558
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:52.340
I still can't understand why you guys can't
sit down and talk about it with more reason

559
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.560
You've been doing this for
more than 15 years and so is he.

560
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.800
It's all about the human soul and psyche

561
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.800
messy

562
00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.980
But you love that aspect of it

563
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:08.020
for the first time I'm worried
about your career though

564
00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.800
I'll be fine

565
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.160
There's no real danger in me
continuing my private practise anyway

566
00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.100
Are you sure about that?

567
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:21.440
Yeah. Just the ethics comitee
still have to make a decision

568
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.800
say something else before I go to sleep

569
00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.720
I don't want to dream about my supervisor

570
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.040
Something else

571
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:36.777
Ohhh

572
00:43:36.801 --> 00:43:38.800
very funny

573
00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:40.800
good night

574
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.800
You're so bad. you're so bad!

575
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.260
You're so naughty

576
00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:41.340
What?

577
00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.080
Untie me!

578
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:53.640
Untie you sweety but. I don't see any ropes

579
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:55.336
my legs!

580
00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.680
"My legs"

581
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.600
This is a nightmare

582
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.000
Ohh "this is a nightmare"

583
00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.620
I'll close my eyes

584
00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:10.800
and when I open them
again. it will all be gone

585
00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.060
Ohh we both know that isn't true don't we?

586
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:24.930
It's not a dream

587
00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.800
It's happening!

588
00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.800
"It's not a dream"

589
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.800
I've got something to tell you

590
00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.800
I have something to tell you

591
00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.800
I have something to say

592
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.776
It's not going to be easy

593
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.800
but I'll just say it

594
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.800
I don't want to come anymore

595
00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.800
it's quite sudden

596
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:24.776
I'm surprised and

597
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.800
well. curious

598
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.920
Well. I'm not sure what we're
doing here is actually helping me

599
00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.800
I do feel different

600
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.400
something did change from the
very first day I came to see you

601
00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:42.776
I don't cut myself that much

602
00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.800
almost never

603
00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:50.060
I feel more pain but also more energy

604
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.776
but then again

605
00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.800
this is what scares me

606
00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.776
this?

607
00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.776
This change

608
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.800
my dreams are move vivid and

609
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:04.800
strange

610
00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.840
I'm sleepwalking even more than I used to

611
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.800
Before we decide wether you
want to go on with me or not

612
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.540
shall we talk more about
your dreams and your fear?

613
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.800
Of course

614
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:26.800
I was raped last night

615
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.776
And it..

616
00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.800
It was so real

617
00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.840
I can't even begin to tell you how I felt

618
00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.840
Do you know who it was?

619
00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.776
Lara's boyfriend

620
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.800
so not anyone from the party then this time

621
00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.860
No but this was worse

622
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:56.800
it was disgusting and it was

623
00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:00.776
unacceptable

624
00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.776
you mean the rape of course

625
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.776
no I don't mean the rape

626
00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.000
Ok. I'm listening

627
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.860
Towards the end of my dream

628
00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:21.240
I went crazy and I started
laughing and enjoying myself

629
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.800
so it wasn't rape after all then

630
00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:28.020
well it was in the beginning

631
00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:28.777
but

632
00:49:28.801 --> 00:49:31.440
then I could move my arms and my legs

633
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.800
but I didn't resist

634
00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:36.940
I felt sort of

635
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.700
free and happy

636
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.776
and mad.

637
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.776
Mad

638
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.800
how does it make you feel now_?

639
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.476
Pregnant

640
00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.380
and horrible

641
00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.380
pregnant?

642
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.920
I'm scared. I can't go on with this

643
00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.776
I really hear your struggle Julianne.

644
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.336
I can only imagine how difficult it must be

645
00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.336
for you to trust in

646
00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.336
such a painful process

647
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.000
without knowing how or where it will end.

648
00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.960
I don't want to carry on with this

649
00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.800
The bad news is

650
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.960
Once you are aware there is no turning back

651
00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:28.540
but

652
00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:32.960
if you stay with it. with enough support

653
00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.040
you will be nourished

654
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.800
what awareness?

655
00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:38.800
Lara's boyfriend

656
00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:40.880
the rape

657
00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:44.080
I don't think this was just plainly sexual

658
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.540
Do you remember Samantha's visions?

659
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.800
You made piece with her
the more we worked on it

660
00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:55.000
she became you and you became her

661
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:58.620
and only then were you able
to critisize my hair and my office

662
00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:04.220
you were able to tell Lara that she
wasn't relating to you without losing it

663
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.240
you felt OK about complaining

664
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.620
Samantha. She was there in the dream

665
00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.780
She was making out with Frank

666
00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:20.440
I really think something is trying
to get your attention here Julianne

667
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.720
It's almost symbolic

668
00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:26.920
like something is being born

669
00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.776
Frank is your best friend's lover

670
00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.776
that's hard for you to get a handle on it

671
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.776
it takes courage

672
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.776
it's too new

673
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.796
too unfamiliar

674
00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.640
You're right. I can't handle it

675
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.800
nor do I want to

676
00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:49.700
It's hard to let you go
at this point Julianne

677
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:54.580
especially when you've come such a long way

678
00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.280
but

679
00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:59.140
I'm not gonna stop you this time

680
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.776
not like our first meeting

681
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.800
but I want you to know

682
00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:08.440
I genuinely support your struggle

683
00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.800
Ok

684
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.300
Thank you Carol

685
00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:25.920
What did Elisabeth look like?

686
00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.800
Did she have reddish
hair? Short in her 70s.

687
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.800
Evet ama

688
00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.660
Why? Did you meet her?

689
00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.320
It's difficult to explain

690
00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:42.800
She said she had something to tell me

691
00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.920
What?

692
00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.800
I don't know

693
00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:48.776
I woke up

694
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.800
What? She was in your dream?

695
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.800
Yes

696
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.776
I don't understand

697
00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.800
I don't understand either

698
00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.800
I had an image of us.

699
00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.580
when you walked in.
you were trying to leave

700
00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:08.800
We were wrestling

701
00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:10.776
Wrestling?

702
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.800
Yes

703
00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:14.920
Do you want to try it?

704
00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:18.800
As much as you can

705
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.040
I could do this all day

706
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.500
No. no. it's just that
she is not usually late

707
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.840
Not to worry

708
00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.240
the piccadilly line is slow anyway

709
00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.540
No. no she usually calls

710
00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:58.420
Mmm! This wine is amazing!

711
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.800
Hello darling! There she is

712
00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.460
How long since we last saw each other ha?

713
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:08.080
Don't let her hug you. she'll
probably break your bones

714
00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.800
Oh shut up. come on

715
00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.776
Hello

716
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.800
Yes. this is she

717
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:42.800
Sorry?

718
00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:48.800
Oh

719
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.800
Sorry I was just I'm just

720
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.800
What?

721
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:10.776
Here?

722
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.776
Now?

723
00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.800
How did you even..

724
00:55:41.130 --> 00:55:42.800
What do you want?

725
00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:47.200
Please Julianne. I just want to see you

726
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.800
Why?

727
00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:53.340
There is something I have to tell you

728
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.640
I have to say something to you

729
00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.776
Does mum know you're here?

730
00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.776
Nobody knows

731
00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:06.800
Please Julianne

732
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.776
So dear tell me

733
00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.776
How is the practise going?

734
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.776
Darling. you know you can't

735
00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.776
Thanks Richard

736
00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.776
I'm not really a fan of
talking about my work

737
00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.776
but it's fine

738
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.776
I'm sorry. I just want to
know how everything is

739
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.800
everything including

740
00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:31.860
but it's Ok if you don't
want to talk about it

741
00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:34.936
No no. it's fine. It's still the same as you
saw me 7 years ago when I first accredited

742
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:38.776
Oh what a time that was

743
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.776
Actually. I'm enjoying it even more

744
00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:44.120
Although sometimes the
practicalities are a bit you know..

745
00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.820
It's so good to see you
without hiding for once

746
00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.800
So this is my girl

747
00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:02.776
I know

748
00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.800
nothing I say is gonna
make things any better

749
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:08.160
Do you also know that what you're
doing is actually making things worse

750
00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.020
Just give me 5 minutes

751
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.800
Do you have a favorite client?

752
00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:20.640
Darling. that's like asking
if you have a favorite child

753
00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:24.540
It is a difficult question Richard I agree

754
00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:27.760
Although

755
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.720
I do have a favorite client

756
00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:34.776
I couldn't let go

757
00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.800
I missed your mother so much

758
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.776
But we were so very young

759
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.800
I know the story you
don't have to repeat it

760
00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.800
What do you want

761
00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:48.776
I wanted to tell you

762
00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:51.540
that none of this was your fault

763
00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.800
or your mother's

764
00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.776
it was love

765
00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.800
stupid love

766
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:02.460
we were imprisoned as teenagers

767
00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:05.500
but you

768
00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:09.700
you never had any say in any of this

769
00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.776
I guess I just

770
00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.800
wanted to apologise

771
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.620
and tell you I'll never forgive myself

772
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.800
Goodbye Julianne

773
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.130
I won't be following you anymore

774
00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.800
I just want to give you this

775
00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:41.380
I'm not taking this. I'm
not taking anything from..

776
00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:44.776
Please. just watch it and then decide

777
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.800
What is this?

778
00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:49.040
This is you

779
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.800
Right from your first years

780
00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.800
I've always been there

781
00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.580
like a shadow

782
00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:59.936
watching you

783
00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.060
I don't want to hear anything please

784
00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.800
Please. Please just take it

785
00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.800
Goodbye Julianne

786
00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.800
I've always loved you

787
00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.800
Dad

788
00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.800
What's that in your bag?

789
00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.776
Nothing. nothing baby

790
00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.000
I have to go

791
00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:31.380
I'm calling the police

792
00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:34.776
No Julianne no. I'm
not going to hurt anyone

793
00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.776
Yeah. As if I will trust you

794
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:38.776

795
00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:40.776

I'll shoot you in the arm

807
01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.800
it won't kill you. but it will hurt

837
01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:30.400
The way you talked about your client.

838
01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.776
You really put your heart and soul into it

839
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.776
Did you see Richard?

840
01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.776
I haven't seen him teary eyed in my life

841
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.776
and we've been friends since med school

842
01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.800

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.800
I gotta go to bed

850
01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:26.800

853
01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.800

854
01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:42.800
Little girl

855
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.360
What are you doing here all alone?

856
01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:48.940
What's your name?

857
01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.800

858
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.800
Sandy

859
01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.800
Where is your mummy Sandy?

860
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.580

861
01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.580
What's her name?

862
01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.800
Carol

863
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.180

Why am I here?

866
01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:28.636
To meet you

867
01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.800
No

868
01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.776
I'm sorry

869
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.776

870
01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.800
Why? Where?

871
01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.800
Over there

872
01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.800
No

873
01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:48.960
Just trust me

874
01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.860
This is mum!

875
01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.800
And that is your dad

876
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:46.100
This is how your body met isolation

877
01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.340
it looks so real

878
01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.800
it is real

879
01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:02.260
this is how you adapted to pain

880
01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:14.060
this is how you left your dreams

881
01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:46.180
Julianne!

882
01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:50.130
Blame me for not telling you the truth

883
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.330
for the feelings I had

884
01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.776
while you grew inside me

885
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.800
I never regret having you for a second

886
01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.360
I've always been there

887
01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.800

888
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.460

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.460

It's one of my clients

897
01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.240
I haven't got time to explain

898
01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.396

899
01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.656

Hello. This is Carol Ashley. I need an ambulance

909
01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:58.776
Honey wait. I mean. who called
you? I never even heard the phone go

910
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.100
It wasn't a phone

911
01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:01.596
I just know that she's in trouble

912
01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:04.160
Carol! I'm getting really worried now

913
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.580
I know you said you had
too much wine but I never

914
01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.796

915
01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.160

916
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.180

middle of the night with your pygamas.

917
01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:15.840
dragging me along and what for?

918
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.520
Because you know she's in trouble?

919
01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.800
Are you coming?

920
01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.800
Carol!

921
01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.776
Excuse me! Excuse me!

922
01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.840
Hey calm down

923
01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.880
Who the hell are you?

924
01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.776
I'm Julie's therapist

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.776
I think she. I think she might be..

926
01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.776
Did she call you? Why are you here?

927
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.800
She text me saying her dad was here and..

928
01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.500
Oh! We need to open this door!

929
01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:08.776
What are you doing?

930
01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.776
Wake up!

931
01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.620
What is happening?

932
01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:14.800
Wake up!

933
01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.800
Hello Julianne

934
01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:30.776
My name is Zachary

935
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.776
I'm a detective

936
01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.800
Where is he?

937
01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.800
Is he dead?

938
01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:40.800
He did it didn't he?

939
01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.800
Yes Julianne. He is dead

940
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:48.776
look

941
01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.000
I know this is not a good
time to come to you with this

942
01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.800
but we need to understand
what happened there Julianne

943
01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.720
Julianne

944
01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.400
Does mum know?

945
01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:08.500
Yes. She does

946
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:12.800
How is she? Can I see her?

947
01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.620
She's outside

948
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.480
She can see you as soon as I'm done here

949
01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.040
Julianne I need to understand
why you fought with your father

950
01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.120
I tried to stop him

951
01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.800
but I couldn't

952
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.800
you can blame me for that

953
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.800
but I won't

954
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.800
not anymore

955
01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:47.180
Do you have children?

956
01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:49.560
No I don't

957
01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.776
A father?

958
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.800
That I do

959
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.400
I had one too

960
01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:02.800
not the one who just
killed himself and shot me

961
01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:05.860
that one loved me

962
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.800
I could see it in his eyes

963
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.300
hear it in his voice

964
01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.800
but I didn't recognize that man

965
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.776
I'm more familiar with the one that

966
01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.800
left me and my mum

967
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.800
the one who didn't care

968
01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.920
I see

969
01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:31.600
Do you know what is most
dangerous in this life detective?

970
01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:34.000
Oh I hope to have an idea by now

971
01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.620
Probably not

972
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.800
It's not the guns detective

973
01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:44.800
It's love

974
01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:49.360
Look where love led my father

975
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.800
test people with it

976
01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:57.740
and guns will come out

977
01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.500
is that what happened here?

978
01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:00.960
Precisely.

979
01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.320
So you admit you killed your..

980
01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:03.380
I admit

981
01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:07.980
that the gun my father brought to my
house was a consequence of his love

982
01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.320
and me trying to stop him

983
01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.800
was also out of love

984
01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:16.776
Julianne I didn't come here to..

985
01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.800
I know you came here for answers detective

986
01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:24.380
but this is all I can offer you

987
01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.800
You can charge me

988
01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:28.800
lock me up

989
01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.940
I will be at peace

990
01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.800
How so?

991
01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:37.580
I finally met my true self

992
01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:40.800
Look at my eyes detective

993
01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.800
I did not kill my father

994
01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.800
Do your searching

995
01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.600
Do your investigation

996
01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.280
but don't forget to add to all that lot

997
01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:58.800
what you see in my eyes

998
01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.800
you are a good person detective

999
01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.800
I'm glad we met

1000
01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.660
I do have a favorite client

1001
01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.660
Therapy is all about connection

1002
01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:24.920
My connection with her feels
like it started before we even met

1003
01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:30.800
through her longing

1004
01:14:30.930 --> 01:14:37.180
she helped me to embrace
my own wound and my own grief

1005
01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:47.080
my lost child. whom I never talk about

1006
01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.530
every wound is an unfinished business

1007
01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:58.320
until they're processed deeply. truly

1008
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:07.330
You know how they say things
are connected in mysterious ways

1009
01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.000
ways we don't know of

1010
01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.930
we may never understand

1011
01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.930
One thing I know though

1012
01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.430
the more we can connect to this world

1013
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:23.460
with fullness with our whole being

1014
01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:26.700
the more we shine

1015
01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.176
Long.

1016
01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.500
long. long. long

1017
01:15:55.200 --> 01:16:00.630
think of a corridor

1018
01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:07.576
Step by step. step by step

1019
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:13.200
A strike that I went to

1020
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:19.360
from myself.

1021
01:16:19.730 --> 01:16:22.330
and from you

1022
01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:28.260
the most beautiful things
that happened to me

1023
01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.200
from my mind

1024
01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:35.900
from my thoughts

1025
01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:48.100
You have never existed anyway

1026
01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.176
Slowly.

1027
01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.176
slowly. slowly

1028
01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.176
slowly

1029
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:13.760
think I'm gone

1030
01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.200
Heavy.

1031
01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:21.460
heavy. heavy. heavy

1032
01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:27.030
while decreasing my load

1033
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.230
from your shoulder

1034
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.330
from your chest

1035
01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.176
Remaining behind

1036
01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.530
the most beautiful days

1037
01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.960
from my love.

1038
01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:52.630
from my life

1039
01:17:53.930 --> 01:18:01.930
you have never existed anyway

1040
01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:41.660
you have never existed anyway
