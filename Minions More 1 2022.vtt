Huh. I wonder what else is on.

90
00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:42.916
What kind of a moron
goes out in public in his underpants?

91
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Hello!

92
00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:48.666
Oh! Wacky neighbor. you're so crazy.

Pinch of nutmeg. hmm.

Harold. what are you doing?

108
00:14:40.583 --> 00:14:44.416
Nothing. So sorry.
I seem to have spilled the tea.

109
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.500
Clumsy of me.

110
00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:49.791
Poison?

111
00:14:49.875 --> 00:14:52.625
Harold. don't come any closer!

112
00:14:52.708 --> 00:14:55.041
Honey. this is just a misunderstanding.

113
00:14:55.125 --> 00:14:56.375
You just stay away from me!

114
00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:57.875
I don't think so.

115
00:15:02.041 --> 00:15:03.416
Leave me alone.

116
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.458
-Not the eyes!

117
00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:07.583
Yes!

Where are you?

119
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.208
Ha!

You shall not pass!

122
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.500
Mommy!

123
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.250
Behold my wrath!

124
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.750
Whoa!

125
00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:00.958
All right. pal. Move it along.

126
00:16:01.041 --> 00:16:04.708
You're lucky I don't smite you
with my powers. vile fiend.

127
00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:07.166
-So I guess that means you're single now?

128
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.833
-Yowzer!

129
00:16:09.916 --> 00:16:14.041
Oh. wacky neighbor.

130
00:16:15.583 --> 00:16:17.500
Where are your pants?

131
00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:31.625
Illumination.

00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:50.833
-I'm getting a double dip.
-I'm getting a chocolate cone.

134
00:16:51.791 --> 00:16:52.708
Come on. let's go.

135
00:16:53.208 --> 00:16:56.125
I'm getting two scoops of…

136
00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.250
Stupid bike.

137
00:17:20.083 --> 00:17:21.166

143
00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:14.041
Wow.

Come on. guys.

146
00:18:29.625 --> 00:18:32.250
I can almost taste it.

147
00:18:35.833 --> 00:18:37.458
-Get out. man.
-Hey.

148
00:18:37.541 --> 00:18:39.291
-Hey! That's my truck!

149

This is the best day ever!

161
00:19:46.583 --> 00:19:48.416
Sorry your bike blew up. Agnes.

162
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.083
Oh. that's okay.
I think I like this bike better anyways.

163
00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:05.333
Whoo-hoo!

164

Okay. We're all set now. Mm.

167

-Always mess that part up.

168
00:21:05.041 --> 00:21:06.833
Whoa! Are you all right?

169
00:21:06.916 --> 00:21:09.208
Oh. it's that song. Johnny.

Takes me back to dancing and romancing.

171

Oh. to be young again.

172

Oh! Come on. Miss Crawly.
it's never too late for romance.

173
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.625
Have you heard of online dating?

174
00:21:20.708 --> 00:21:23.041
Online… No. what's that?

175
00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:25.958
First.
we've got to make your profile.

176
00:21:26.041 --> 00:21:28.000
-What are your hobbies?
-Oh. let's see now.

177

"Moonbathing"?

182
00:21:37.375 --> 00:21:40.500
Oh. yes.
it's like sunbathing. but at night.

183
00:21:40.583 --> 00:21:43.083
Wonderful for the skin.

184
00:21:43.166 --> 00:21:44.833
-Mmm.
-Hmm…

185

Okay. We're gonna need a profile photo.

Okay.

187
00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:55.958
Don't worry if it takes. you know.
a little while for someone to respond.

188
00:21:56.041 --> 00:21:57.166
-What?

189
00:21:57.625 --> 00:21:59.875
-Wow! Look.
-Oh. my!

190
00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:03.583
-Looks like the old gal's still got it.

191
00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:24.208
-Mmm…

192
00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:31.416
-Oh!

193
00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:36.041
Wha…

194
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.166
I… I think this belongs to you.

195
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.875
Oh. yes. thank you.

196
00:23:55.958 --> 00:24:00.041
Beautiful night for moonbathing.
don't you think?

197
00:24:01.166 --> 00:24:03.125
Oh. Yes.

198
00:24:03.666 --> 00:24:05.291
It's wonderful.

199
00:24:40.916 --> 00:24:43.083
Illumination!

200
00:25:04.125 --> 00:25:05.833
Come on. We're late.

201
00:25:06.416 --> 00:25:07.458
Good boy.

202
00:25:07.541 --> 00:25:09.625
-I'm gonna miss you. fuzzy-face.

203
00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:10.833
Don't eat anybody.

204
00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:26.875
Hmm.

205
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:32.250
-Oh. hello. Miriam.

206
00:26:32.333 --> 00:26:33.791
Hello. Abner.

207
00:26:33.875 --> 00:26:36.333
-Urn. I've come to. you know…
-Ooh!

208
00:26:36.416 --> 00:26:38.166
I didn't know you had a dog.

209
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:40.833
-He's adorable.

210
00:26:40.916 --> 00:26:44.916
Yeah!
I love this crazy little guy.

211
00:26:47.875 --> 00:26:49.916
I have the perfect thing for him.

212
00:26:52.583 --> 00:26:55.125
So. are you doing anything on Friday?

213
00:26:57.416 --> 00:26:58.750
Yes! I mean…

214
00:26:58.833 --> 00:27:00.375
I mean. no. I'm available.

215
00:27:58.666 --> 00:28:00.708
Bella. dinner time.

216
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:37.541
Ow! Ooh.

217
00:28:41.875 --> 00:28:44.208
Ah. There you are.

218
00:28:47.458 --> 00:28:49.875
That's much better.

219
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.000
Whoo-hoo!

220
00:28:56.458 --> 00:28:57.500
Geronimo!

221
00:28:57.583 --> 00:28:58.708
Cannonball!

222
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.666
-Come on. Timmy.
-Hurry up!

223
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.250
I can't… I can't do it.

224
00:29:03.333 --> 00:29:05.541
Ah. Timmy. don't be such a weenie.

225
00:29:05.625 --> 00:29:07.041
Yeah. what a weenie.

226
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.500
I blew it.

227
00:29:13.958 --> 00:29:15.625
Oh. Hey there. Timmy.

228
00:29:15.708 --> 00:29:17.208
Why so sad?

229
00:29:17.291 --> 00:29:18.500
Hey. Mr. Mayor.

230
00:29:18.916 --> 00:29:21.250
They called me a weenie.

231
00:29:21.333 --> 00:29:24.500
Why. you're acting
like that's a bad thing.

232
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.250
Isn't it?

233
00:29:27.625 --> 00:29:28.833
Oh. Timmy.

234
00:29:59.791 --> 00:30:00.625
A weenie!

235
00:30:07.333 --> 00:30:08.166
Teeny!

236
00:30:11.041 --> 00:30:11.875
Oh. yeah!

237
00:30:26.875 --> 00:30:28.625
Wait a minute. so you mean…

238
00:30:31.166 --> 00:30:32.208
That's right!

239
00:30:38.875 --> 00:30:39.875
Ooh.

240
00:30:46.708 --> 00:30:47.541
Wow!

241
00:30:51.458 --> 00:30:53.041
Too long?

242
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:56.541
A weenie!

243
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:09.583
Hello!

244
00:31:18.541 --> 00:31:20.458
-Ciao!
-But where do we all come from?

245
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.333
A weenie!

246
00:31:51.625 --> 00:31:52.458
A weenie!

247
00:31:55.166 --> 00:31:56.000
Yeah!

248
00:32:06.583 --> 00:32:07.416
A weenie!

249
00:32:15.458 --> 00:32:16.458
Is that Timmy?

250
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:17.625
Whoo-hoo!

251
00:32:19.041 --> 00:32:19.916
I'm a weenie!

252
00:32:39.541 --> 00:32:40.416
Hmm.

253
00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:00.416
Hmm.

254
00:33:01.958 --> 00:33:03.750
-Hmm.

255
00:33:03.833 --> 00:33:04.916
-Shh!

256
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.208
-Shh!

257
00:33:07.708 --> 00:33:10.916
So. kid.
how'd you like to be an honorary Lorax?

258
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
-Come on. Follow me.

259
00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:24.500
Ah!

260
00:33:26.041 --> 00:33:27.791
Seriously!

261
00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:33.333
It's time to release the kraken!

262
00:33:47.958 --> 00:33:54.458
Once-ler! You are doomed.

263
00:33:57.541 --> 00:33:59.375
Oooh…

264
00:34:00.625 --> 00:34:01.625
Oh!

265
00:34:07.416 --> 00:34:10.333
Okay! Now he's really on my bad side.

266
00:34:11.291 --> 00:34:13.916
You know what? You're all right. kid.

267
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.416
I bet when you grow up.
you'll turn out just like me.

268
00:34:22.083 --> 00:34:25.000
You just lost your honorary Lorax status.

269
00:34:25.666 --> 00:34:27.458
There it goes. kiss it goodbye!

270
00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:29.500
Pip!

271
00:35:20.666 --> 00:35:21.500
Oh!

272
00:35:21.583 --> 00:35:23.458
Oh. no!

273
00:35:28.958 --> 00:35:29.958
Oh.

274
00:35:38.666 --> 00:35:39.791
-Phew!

275
00:35:55.083 --> 00:35:56.750
Hyah. hyah! Whoo!

276
00:35:56.833 --> 00:35:58.583
Okay. everybody. time to start.

277
00:36:06.708 --> 00:36:08.416
-Come a little closer.

278
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.666
-Wow.

279
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.833
Who's ready for Elf training?

280
00:36:11.916 --> 00:36:13.125
-Me!
-Me. me!

281
00:36:13.208 --> 00:36:14.458
Hit it. boys!

282
00:36:39.916 --> 00:36:41.541
That's not…

283
00:36:45.208 --> 00:36:47.666
All right. let's train you
for something else.

284
00:36:49.416 --> 00:36:50.291
Huh?

285
00:37:03.625 --> 00:37:06.291
I know the perfect job for you guys.

286
00:37:12.333 --> 00:37:14.458
Oh! Aw…

287
00:37:17.041 --> 00:37:18.666
-Oh.

288
00:37:23.333 --> 00:37:24.375
No. no. no. no!

289
00:37:26.541 --> 00:37:28.041
-Huh?

290
00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:43.208
Oh. no!

291
00:37:43.291 --> 00:37:44.583
No. no. no. no. no!

292
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.166
You've ruined everything!

293
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:50.791
-You'll never be elves!

294
00:37:50.875 --> 00:37:51.875
-Huh?
-Ow!

295
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:54.708
-Ho-ho-ho!

296
00:37:54.791 --> 00:37:57.041
Santa's coming!

297
00:38:08.458 --> 00:38:09.291
Huh.

298
00:38:12.791 --> 00:38:14.291
-Ho-ho-ho!

299
00:38:14.375 --> 00:38:16.708
Ahem. your sleigh is all ready. Santa!

300
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:21.625
Wait!

301
00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:26.541
Trainees. am I right?
