Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

Star Command. come in.
Do you read me?

ANGUS MACLANE: <i>When we were making</i>
Toy Story. <i>the first one.</i>

11
00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:27.902
<i>it was just director John Lasseter</i>
<i>and a very small group of us</i>

12
00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.822
<i>coming up with</i>
<i>the characters and situations.</i>

13
00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.908
<i>And. of course. the toy version of Buzz.</i>

14
00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.910
And now we're about to release a film

15
00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.830
about the origin story
of this Buzz Lightyear character.

16
00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.375
<i>We get to grapple with this question.</i>

17
00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.464
"Who is Buzz Lightyear?"

18
00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.893
I'm Buzz Lightyear. Space Ranger.
Universe Protection Unit.

19
00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:04.564
His job in the first films is to show up
and basically push Woody's buttons.

20
00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.402
He's the best of the best.
and he knows it.

21
00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.490
<i>He understands everything</i>
<i>in all the manuals.</i>

22
00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:14.908
<i>he's studied the hardest.</i>

23
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:16.076
Woody. are you all right?

24
00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.995
He's the strongest. he's the fastest.
he's the estest.

25
00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.122
(TOYS GASP)

26
00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:25.043
Buzz is the most upright citizen...

27
00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:27.837
We will not rest
until he's safe in Andy's room!

28
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:32.801
...and takes his policing job
very. very. very seriously.

29
00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.719
Watch yourself!
Halt! Who goes there?

30
00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:36.971
He's the straight guy.
he's the very literal guy.

31
00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:40.850
Everything that's on the box
is the sum total of his knowledge.

32
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.603
BUZZ: <i>I protect the galaxy</i>
<i>from the threat of invasion.</i>

33
00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:45.396
He doesn't understand that he's the toy

34
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.650
based off of this character
on the big screen.

35
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.569
He thinks he is that character.

36
00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:53.905
Very impressed
with Andy's new toy.

37
00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:56.449
-Toy?
-T-O-Y. Toy.

38
00:01:56.533 --> 00:02:00.537
Excuse me. I think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger."

39
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.082
And the comedy all comes from that
disagreement over the nature of reality.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:13.174
It was Woody's movie.
but you need one for the other to work.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:15.927
<i>It's a dance.</i>

44
00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.223
Good morning. I'm Pete.

45
00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.434
Today we'll learn how to animate
in less than two minutes.

46
00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.729
We type in the magic UNIX commands.

47
00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.732
In 1990. Pixar had done
a bunch of short films.

48
00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:34.988
I knew that the goal was
to eventually do a feature.

49
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:36.573
and the thought was.

50
00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.117
"Let's do an intermediate step.
we'll do a Christmas special."

51
00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:43.454
Using characters
from one of the short films. <i>Tin Toy.</i>

52
00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.295
That just seemed like
a very appealing. fun world.

53
00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:54.174
the world of toys. Seeing things from
the toys' point of view. way down low.

54
00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:59.804
The thrill was this must be
what it feels like to be this small

55
00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:03.183
<i>on the floor and encounter</i>
<i>a giant reckless baby.</i>

56
00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:09.189
At the same time. Disney said.
"Hey. you know what?

57
00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.025
"We'd be willing to spring for a feature.

58
00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:15.028
"What do you want to do?"
And we were like. "I have no idea."

59
00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:18.031
So we thought. what if
we just use the Christmas special

60
00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:20.158
that we are writing as the first act

61
00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:22.535
<i>and then we'll just go from there.</i>

62
00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.704
because we had no idea
what we were doing.

63
00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.456
<i>In animation at that time.</i>

64
00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.750
it was musical. musical... Only musicals.

65
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:32.462
So the idea that we could do
some other kind of storytelling

66
00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.005
<i>was really attractive.</i>

67
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.093
One of the first things that happened.
in our story. was that

68
00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:43.514
<i>Tinny met this other ventriloquist doll.</i>
<i>the old established toy.</i>

69
00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.350
And this new toy comes

70
00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:50.230
and is now threatening
this old toy's place in Andy's room.

71
00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:53.483
This new cool. amazing tin toy?

72
00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:56.486
So we're like.
"Okay. that doesn't quite work."

73
00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.529
What was the toy we all wanted as kids?

74
00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.573
We wanted action figures. you know.

75
00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:03.534
with. like karate chop action
or exploding briefcases.

76
00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.662
all kind of like. these moving parts.

77
00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.956
Tinny had to go up on the shelf.

78
00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.751
and his part was taken over by this
brand new character that we were creating.

79
00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:13.169
named Buzz Lightyear.

80
00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:19.634
Initially. Buzz was more of
a golden age space hero from the '30s.

81
00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:27.767
I did all these things that almost looked
like water heaters with fins on them.

82
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.937
<i>Things that were based</i>
<i>on Roman legionnaire helmets</i>

83
00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.772
<i>and all that older. classic stuff.</i>

84
00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.491
LAUREN GAYLORD: <i>We have</i>
<i>so many drawings of Buzz</i>

85
00:04:43.574 --> 00:04:45.618
<i>that sometimes it's hard to differentiate.</i>

86
00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:50.123
This is one that we have
nicknamed Big Hair Buzz.

87
00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:53.584
It's a distinguishing part of this
stage of character design.

88
00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:55.795
because in the end
Buzz has no hair.

89
00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:58.756
DOCTER: <i>Buzz Lightyear wasn't always</i>
<i>called Buzz Lightyear.</i>

90
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.258
He was even called Lunar Larry.

91
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:03.011
<i>One of the suits has. like. the LL on it.</i>

92
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.890
This is from an early animation test.

93
00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:12.270
Woody is Slim. and the character
that would become Buzz is Tecor.

94
00:05:12.353 --> 00:05:16.399
But it looks like they weren't
necessarily satisfied with that

95
00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:21.154
because on this particular script. they've
made all these other acronyms for him.

96
00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.699
He could have been TOLAR or MICROZ.

97
00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:27.952
JEFF PIDGEON: <i>And then one of them</i>
<i>was Tempus from Morph.</i>

98
00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:32.790
I don't know if we use that
for more than that one test.

99
00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.046
Hey. pal. whatcha doin'?

100
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.048
I'm Tempus from Morph...

101
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.799
Yeah. what's this button?

102
00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.260
Say. you weren't
thinkin' of flyin'. were ya'?

103
00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:47.138
-Well...
-You know. Andy loves toys that can fly.

104
00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:48.389
BUZZ: <i>Really?</i>

105
00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.183
When we look
at the final drawings.

106
00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:53.936
we think that was
the right Buzz to choose.

107
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.646
But how did we get there?

108
00:05:57.148 --> 00:06:00.276
So fun to just see all the iterations.

109
00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.533
Just warming up still. Yes.

110
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:13.664
When I came on. John Lasseter
wanted to have a contemporary new toy

111
00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:17.585
<i>and asked if we could do</i>
<i>something more like an astronaut.</i>

112
00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:23.257
<i>So we looked at NASA.</i>
<i>We looked at the astronauts.</i>

113
00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.468
Same time. we're going to the toy stores.

114
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.639
we're taking things apart. figuring out
how they work. how they articulate.

115
00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.559
<i>And the wings needed to function</i>
<i>like we're going to make this thing.</i>

116
00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:37.188
So I came up with the way that they would
swing out to the side.

117
00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:40.900
I thought you could make that.
I can see a toy being built with that.

118
00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:44.404
The minute we said
12 inches like G.I. Joe. "Yes".

119
00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:45.988
The minute we said new. "Yes".

120
00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:48.282
Let's give him karate chop action. "Yes".

121
00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:51.285
<i>The minute Bob Pauley said</i>
<i>"What if we make it white</i>

122
00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.287
<i>and give it</i>
<i>a little accent with color?"</i>

123
00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.372
we are all like. "Yes."

124
00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:58.126
And he should have some declarative thing
that he says.

125
00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:01.003
To infinity and beyond!

126
00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.425
That just made everybody laugh.

127
00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:08.177
We loved that it made no sense. (CHUCKLES)

128
00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:12.223
There is no beyond infinity.
Infinity is infinite.

129
00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:14.475
Henceforth there is
no beyond infinity.

130
00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:17.812
Felt like it really captured
the essence of who he was.

131
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:22.817
LEE UNKRICH: <i>They had a sense of who</i>
<i>Buzz was and who they wanted him to be.</i>

132
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.447
But once the decision was made
to cast Tim Allen as Buzz.

133
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.949
so much of his character
just clicked into place.

134
00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:34.579
It was actually Tim Allen's idea to play
Buzz like an average street cop.

135
00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:37.248
They've been watching Sid in the backyard.

136
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:39.917
the mean kid. blow up
the Combat Carl with the M-80.

137
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:41.794
-I coulda stopped him.
-Right.

138
00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:43.421
What's going on?

139
00:07:43.504 --> 00:07:47.258
So instead of being this unrealistic.
kind of.

140
00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:50.636
"I'll save you. eager young space cadet."
kind of guy.

141
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.388
he's playing it more like. "Yeah.

142
00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:55.099
"I'm going to be hanging out
around the corner."

143
00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.477
There's a kid over in that house
who needs us.

144
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.187
Now let's get you out of this thing.

145
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.688
DOCTER: <i>He's a bit more realistic.</i>

146
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:02.565
He's a little more earthbound.

147
00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:05.109
No. no. no. Go. go.
Just go. I'll catch up.

148
00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:08.321
And it really shaped the way
we wrote the character.

149
00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:11.282
<i>the way we thought of him.</i>
<i>in major ways.</i>

150
00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:12.408
Sheriff!

151
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:14.243
Sheriff?

152
00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:15.620
There you are.

153
00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:22.376
PAULEY: <i>When we were designing Buzz.</i>
<i>I thought we had something.</i>

154
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.045
<i>You know. it was cool.</i>

155
00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:28.799
But we didn't have a clue that this was
going to become some kind of phenomenon.

156
00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:32.595
<i>that Woody and Buzz</i>
<i>would be household names.</i>

157
00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:36.599
To infinity and beyond.

158
00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:54.200
(SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGES)

159
00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.162
Space Ranger.

160
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.545
WOODY: <i>Buzz. this is the Oscars.</i>

161
00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.421
It's supposed to be formal.

162
00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.840
Well. that would explain
all the penguins then

163
00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.385
The whole thing was shocking.

164
00:09:12.468 --> 00:09:16.472
I remember when the film came out
and driving down the freeway and be like.

165
00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.891
"There's a billboard for <i>Toy Story."</i>

166
00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:24.814
And it was really wild to see Buzz go up
on the International Space Station.

167
00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:29.402
That was wow.

168
00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:31.779
You created this character
who wants to be in space.

169
00:09:31.862 --> 00:09:35.366
and now he's literally gone further
than most of us ever will.

170
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:37.743
For us to think
we would get to do anything more

171
00:09:40.454 --> 00:09:42.832
would have been just crazy thinking.

172
00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.084
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

173
00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:48.629
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refueling station of some sort.

174
00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:52.883
Buzz was kind of a deluded sidekick.
and somehow he really spoke to kids.

175
00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:57.763
I'm not sure exactly what that means.

176
00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:03.603
We tried to design a toy
that would be really cool for Andy.

177
00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:06.647
that Andy would set aside Woody for.

178
00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:11.444
PAULEY: <i>Turns out that we created a toy</i>
<i>that in the movie was a good character.</i>

179
00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:14.614
but also actually a pretty darn good toy
in reality.

180
00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.575
JENNIFER TAN: <i>He is the toy</i>
<i>that all the kids want.</i>

181
00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:25.291
<i>There's always an interest in continuing</i>
<i>the exploration of Buzz as a toy.</i>

182
00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:32.715
<i>How else can we have fun with Buzz?</i>

183
00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:41.307
He's this superhero that every kid
either wants to be like

184
00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:43.476
or wants to be friends with.

185
00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:47.980
Buzz appeals to adults
and kids of all ages.

186
00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:49.732
<i>of all genders.</i>

187
00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.901
<i>And that's why you see Buzz everything.</i>

188
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:57.031
<i>There's Buzz costumes. Buzz sneakers.</i>

189
00:10:57.198 --> 00:11:02.078
<i>We work on action figures.</i>
<i>pencil toppers. apparel...</i>

190
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.454
TAN: <i>Buzz backpacks.</i>

191
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.042
<i>lunchboxes. juice boxes. paper towels.</i>

192
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.086
<i>anything you can think of.</i>

193
00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.464
Stickers on bananas. socks.

194
00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:15.758
I love my Buzz and Woody socks.

195
00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.844
<i>I love how Buzz is everywhere</i>

196
00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:22.223
<i>and people have</i>
<i>made their versions of him.</i>

197
00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:26.185
UNKRICH: <i>A lot of it's handcrafted.</i>

198
00:11:26.268 --> 00:11:28.312
a lot of it's not coming out of factories.

199
00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:33.192
It's just people making cool little
wooden pull toys or puppets.

200
00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:35.736
People just love the characters.

201
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.823
PAULEY: <i>I guess. in a way. the design</i>
<i>worked out. and it looks good</i>

202
00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:41.283
<i>because you can be still so far off</i>

203
00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:44.120
<i>and you know</i>
<i>there's a Buzz in there somewhere.</i>

204
00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.539
SUSMAN: <i>I have seen some bizarre ones.</i>

205
00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:50.668
They look like
Buzz was put in a microwave.

206
00:11:50.751 --> 00:11:54.422
It's not really the real Buzz.
but you can tell it's Buzz Lightyear.

207
00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.221
MACLANE: <i>When I started working at Pixar.</i>

208
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:06.684
<i>I was just blown away</i>
<i>by the Buzz Lightyear character.</i>

209
00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:10.271
<i>His square personality.</i>
<i>I always thought. was hilarious.</i>

210
00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.816
DOCTER: <i>Angus became</i>
<i>the go-to Buzz animator.</i>

211
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.902
If I'm having trouble.
I can go to Angus.

212
00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:20.197
not only with technical things.
but with artistic choices.

213
00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:22.199
<i>Like. what kind of expressions</i>
<i>he makes.</i>

214
00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.368
<i>-and hand gestures.</i>
-(GASPING)

215
00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:28.497
And I'd always wondered what was the show

216
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:31.208
<i>or the movie</i>
<i>that Buzz Lightyear came from.</i>

217
00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:35.504
And so that was something that was always
cooking in the back of my head.

218
00:12:36.213 --> 00:12:39.133
Terrain seems a bit unstable.

219
00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:42.428
SUSMAN: Lightyear <i>and</i> Toy Story
<i>are intrinsically connected.</i>

220
00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:49.059
Andy. the kid in <i>Toy Story.</i> is so excited
to get this Buzz Lightyear doll.

221
00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:51.020
Why is he so excited?

222
00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:55.274
Well. we all thought that he was excited
because he probably went to see a movie.

223
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.486
<i>And we're saying that</i>
<i>that movie is</i> Lightyear.

224
00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.199
MACLANE: <i>Then it was trying to figure out.</i>

225
00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:06.160
"Well. what kind of story
are we telling with Buzz?"

226
00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:11.957
And the character is more than just
the character in the <i>Toy Story</i> world.

227
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:13.834
It's a different character.

228
00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:19.173
There's a general way that Buzz moves
through the world. a confidence.

229
00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:20.341
This way!

230
00:13:20.424 --> 00:13:21.509
<i>...a belief in himself.</i>

231
00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:23.803
I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure.

232
00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.263
But we have to feel like
he has this inner life.

233
00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:32.144
SUSMAN: <i>Having an iconic character</i>
<i>to start from doesn't solve it for us.</i>

234
00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.146
<i>It makes it a little easier.</i>

235
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.274
<i>but there's a whole lot</i>
<i>of discovery we have to do.</i>

236
00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:40.069
And the stakes are even higher
when you're reimagining

237
00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:42.446
<i>such a beloved character</i>
<i>like Buzz Lightyear.</i>

238
00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:46.784
I think the texture is the next thing.
and then lighting. Which...

239
00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:48.869
STANTON: <i>The biggest thing</i>
<i>a director does...</i>

240
00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:51.872
This is nice and elegant.
but it has to be pushed up just a hair.

241
00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.124
You're a coach. you're a cheerleader...

242
00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:55.501
It feels pretty great.

243
00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:56.919
I love the gesture of the nose.

244
00:13:57.002 --> 00:14:00.589
<i>...you're a vision keeper</i>
<i>and you're a navigator.</i>

245
00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.970
<i>There's a lot of times</i>
<i>you're just at the bow of the ship</i>

246
00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:09.348
where there's just a ton of fog.
and you're saying. "There's land there.

247
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:11.392
"Believe me.
I promise you we'll get there."

248
00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:14.854
I think the action
is actually just the steam.

249
00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:21.777
A lot of great sci-fi hinges
on a real world parable or a deeper truth.

250
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.280
So I was trying to find
what's the deeper truth?

251
00:14:28.492 --> 00:14:31.161
<i>When you're making a movie.</i>
<i>it takes such a long time.</i>

252
00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:35.749
<i>You need to find something you can</i>
<i>latch onto that feels personal.</i>

253
00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:43.007
<i>This campus is</i>
<i>one of the inspirations for the movie.</i>

254
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.593
I have different memories
from different years

255
00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:48.387
that go back 20. almost 22 years now.

256
00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:51.181
<i>That's where I brought my daughter to work</i>

257
00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:54.393
<i>for the very first time</i>
<i>when she was six months old.</i>

258
00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:56.395
<i>We finished the movie there.</i>

259
00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:59.523
<i>That's the last time</i>
<i>I saw that person alive.</i>

260
00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:02.067
Having been at the studio for a long time.

261
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:05.487
<i>the sense of time passing</i>
<i>was first and foremost in my mind.</i>

262
00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:10.910
<i>When you work on films.</i>
<i>the perceived time passes differently.</i>

263
00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:16.916
<i>You do these four-year jumps.</i>
<i>these five-year jumps.</i>

264
00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:20.002
When you stick your head out of the hole.
you go. "What happened?"

265
00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:22.796
Everyone else is like.
"All kinds of things happened."

266
00:15:25.549 --> 00:15:27.426
<i>The pandemic certainly added to that.</i>

267
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.888
DEAN KELLY: <i>It's like</i> Groundhog Day.

268
00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:33.849
We have our deadlines
and then my kid's school year.

269
00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.268
<i>That's how you knew</i>
<i>that time was passing.</i>

270
00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:40.940
At Pixar. we've been lucky to be able
to work through this pandemic.

271
00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:44.568
SUSMAN: <i>Immersed back in our families</i>
<i>in ways that we hadn't been.</i>

272
00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:49.031
KELLY: <i>Looking at it now. it's evident</i>
<i>that the pandemic influenced Buzz's story.</i>

273
00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:53.369
Being able to overcome these odds.
but also know that you're not alone

274
00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.579
<i>and trying to do</i>
<i>what you need to get done.</i>

275
00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.001
It's amazing to see how connected we are
and how separated we are at the same time.

276
00:16:02.544 --> 00:16:04.964
"That would be
an interesting problem for Buzz.

277
00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:06.632
"Could he be in a situation where

278
00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:09.593
"he was traveling through time
at a different rate than others?"

279
00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:10.719
It's looking good.

280
00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:13.013

<i>and also chaos.</i>

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:27.277
The first few years of the film.
it's actually the story department

286
00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:30.239
<i>and editorial kind of building the film</i>
<i>from scratch.</i>

287

<i>in a very cinematic way.</i>

Zurg holding Buzz. right?

303
00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:18.787
So he turns...

304
00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:22.624
What if it's a reaction.
like Zurg's like... And he reacts?

305
00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:25.461
That way. Just so we know

<i>a planet that has some resources.</i>

325
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.658
Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.
Stardate 3-9-0-1.

326
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:41.161
Sensors have detected potential lifeforms
on an uncharted planet.

327
00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:44.456
There seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

328
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:48.836
EVANS: <i>The ship gets attacked.</i>
<i>then. as they're trying to take off.</i>

329
00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:52.089
Buzz is responsible for the ship crashing.

330
00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:56.510
MACLANE: <i>He spends an entire film</i>
<i>trying to get back home.</i>

331
00:18:57.886 --> 00:19:00.430
Not only is it his fault.
based on his actions.

332
00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:03.559
but he had the opportunity to be assisted.
He could've had help.

333
00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:05.686
I'm better off just doing the job myself.

334
00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:10.482
<i>In trying to return home.</i>

335
00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:16.697
<i>Buzz would have to be doing tests</i>
<i>that would cause him to time travel.</i>

336
00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:25.080
COMPUTER: <i>Approaching 50% hyperspeed.</i>

337
00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:28.458
It takes him about four or five minutes
to do one of these missions

338
00:19:28.542 --> 00:19:30.961
while everybody else on the planet
ages four years.

339
00:19:31.044 --> 00:19:35.340
He is aging at a different rate
than all of his friends.

340
00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:39.219
<i>and he sees them grow old</i>
<i>as he continually fails</i>

341
00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:41.263
<i>to make up for the big mistake.</i>

342
00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:45.392
That social dislocation
was the most captivating to all of us.

343
00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:46.935
Thought we'd lost you. Buzz.

344
00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:48.520
Alisha? What happened?

345
00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:50.480
Time dilation.

346
00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:51.648
What?

347
00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:53.150
Time dilation is quite simple.

348
00:19:53.233 --> 00:19:55.277
As you approached hyperspeed.

349
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.738
your time slowed relative to our own.

350
00:19:57.821 --> 00:20:00.908
I'm glad you asked me about time dilation.
because I am a physicist.

351
00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:03.744
Right? So the faster...

352
00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:05.495
Oh. boy.

353
00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:07.497
The faster you travel.

354
00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:11.001
relative to something
that is not traveling at that speed.

355
00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:16.131
your time slows down
because time is relative and...

356
00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:20.260
The faster you you go toward...
Approaching the speed of light.

357
00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:26.058
the less time passes for you
relativistically.

358
00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:29.186
Now. nobody actually can hit
the speed of light.

359
00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:31.355
You would become infinite mass.

360
00:20:31.438 --> 00:20:34.358
Would explode type of thing...
Like. you wouldn't be.

361
00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:36.735
That makes no sense.

362
00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:39.947
You really should get somebody
really smart in here for this.

363
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:46.912
Station. this is Angus MacLane and
Galyn Susman with Pixar Animation.

364
00:20:46.995 --> 00:20:48.080
Do you hear us?

365
00:20:48.163 --> 00:20:49.331
How do you hear us?

366
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.626
<i>The time dilations is real.</i>

367
00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:54.670
Because the speed of light is the same

368
00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:57.714
no matter who's looking.
who's observing it.

369
00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:00.425
that time progresses more slowly

370
00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:03.053
for people and objects
that are moving fast

371
00:21:03.136 --> 00:21:05.222
compared to the objects
that are not moving fast.

372
00:21:05.305 --> 00:21:07.975
MAN: <i>Station. this is Houston ACR.</i>
<i>That concludes the event. Thank you.</i>

373
00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:09.351
MACLANE: <i>Thank you.</i>
SUSMAN: <i>Thank you.</i>

374
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.355
That's what time dilation is.

375
00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:14.982
And I don't want any letters.

376
00:21:16.316 --> 00:21:19.278
MARGARET SPENCER:
<i>One of the biggest nuts to crack</i>

377
00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:21.363
<i>was why Buzz cares so much.</i>

378
00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:23.490
Something that really helped us out was

379
00:21:23.573 --> 00:21:26.994
the creation of this character. Alisha.
the partner.

380
00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:29.830
somebody who we could track aging
as he was staying the same.

381
00:21:30.872 --> 00:21:33.500
UZO ADUBA: <i>Alisha is a dynamic...</i>

382
00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:34.793
That's an order.

383
00:21:34.876 --> 00:21:36.420
...capable leader.

384
00:21:36.503 --> 00:21:38.672
I'm gonna grant you four minutes
to be off-planet.

385
00:21:38.755 --> 00:21:40.799
but then you come right back to us.

386
00:21:40.924 --> 00:21:43.760
Trying to advance and save the universe

387
00:21:43.844 --> 00:21:46.471
along with her friend. Buzz Lightyear.

388
00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:49.349
Okay. but maybe
we should think about this.

389
00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:52.185
The great tragedy of it is

390
00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:56.481
because he was so focused
and so consumed with the mission...

391
00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:59.651
-That's what Space Rangers do.
-At what cost. Buzz?

392
00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:02.237
Are you willing to lose
another four years?

393
00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:05.824
<i>...he missed all of her life.</i>

394
00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:12.247
SUSMAN: <i>What Alisha represents</i>
<i>is the life well-lived.</i>

395
00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:13.957
<i>that he never had.</i>

396
00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:17.169
<i>Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.</i>

397
00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:21.590
Buzz Lightyear. the character design
is extraordinarily iconic.

398
00:22:22.215 --> 00:22:25.635
<i>And I wanted to celebrate</i>
<i>and get away from that design.</i>

399
00:22:26.928 --> 00:22:30.307
SUSMAN: <i>Trying to get the right balance</i>

400
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:35.354
<i>of the Buzz people are expecting to see</i>
<i>when they walk into the theater</i>

401
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:40.025
<i>with enough new. different mystery...</i>

402
00:22:40.567 --> 00:22:42.486
<i>"I'm now the protagonist.</i>

403
00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:45.781
<i>"and have my own story and growth."</i>

404
00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:48.992
<i>That balance is really tricky.</i>

405
00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:51.453
<i>He will step out of the ship.</i>

406
00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:54.498
And if you remember
all the way back in <i>Toy Story.</i>

407
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:56.708
<i>when we first met Buzz.</i>

408
00:22:56.792 --> 00:23:00.587
<i>you pan up and you see his face.</i>
<i>well. we have a shot very similar to that.</i>

409
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.632
<i>to try to help get people into</i>
<i>the. "Okay. this is Buzz"...</i>

410
00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:05.926
I will explore further
the oddities of this strange planet.

411
00:23:06.009 --> 00:23:07.636
This is kind of the Buzz we know.

412
00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:10.972
but this is not the Buzz we know.
Because it's a different Buzz.

413
00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:15.102
And the stakes are even higher

414
00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:17.729
when you're taking
a beloved character like Buzz Lightyear

415
00:23:17.813 --> 00:23:19.648
and you're reimagining him.

416
00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:24.403
There's somebody out there
with a Buzz Lightyear tattoo on their arm.

417
00:23:24.486 --> 00:23:26.947
I don't want that person
coming up to me later and be like.

418
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.865
"Look. man.
you ruined my childhood.

419
00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:30.409
"You ruined my arm." You know.

420
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.663
SUSMAN: <i>Character design starts</i>
<i>from the</i> Toy Story <i>Buzz.</i>

421
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:39.709
but <i>Toy Story</i> Buzz
has this ginormous chin.

422
00:23:40.377 --> 00:23:42.712
<i>That's just not real.</i>
<i>That's not human.</i>

423
00:23:42.796 --> 00:23:44.506
Nobody has a chin that big.

424
00:23:44.589 --> 00:23:46.550
To get the Buzz Lightyear
from the toy

425
00:23:46.633 --> 00:23:50.303
to now this actual human action hero.

426
00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:52.055
<i>he becomes a Space Ranger.</i>

427
00:23:52.139 --> 00:23:54.266
<i>but we also see his heart grow.</i>

428
00:23:56.726 --> 00:24:00.981
<i>To tell that story.</i>
<i>there had to be stakes and issues</i>

429
00:24:01.064 --> 00:24:03.817
<i>that a man would deal with</i>
<i>and not a toy.</i>

430
00:24:05.902 --> 00:24:09.614
<i>When I design a character.</i>
<i>it's usually an emotional reason first.</i>

431
00:24:10.574 --> 00:24:14.953
<i>Then later we can start talking about</i>
<i>shape and why he did certain things.</i>

432
00:24:15.036 --> 00:24:19.249
<i>But as an artist. I can't say.</i>
<i>"Oh. this is how we made him vulnerable."</i>

433
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.252
<i>Somehow putting your heart</i>
<i>into something.</i>

434
00:24:22.335 --> 00:24:24.129
<i>as humans. we just know that.</i>

435
00:24:26.047 --> 00:24:27.716
That's very ethereal.

436
00:24:29.342 --> 00:24:31.595
DEAN HEEZEN: <i>The art of caricature</i>
<i>is all about pushing</i>

437
00:24:31.678 --> 00:24:34.389
<i>the shapes and certain features.</i>

438
00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:37.767
<i>Taking what's there in real life</i>
<i>and emphasizing it.</i>

439
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.231
We were laughing 'cause when we tried
the big chin. and the round eyes.

440
00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.275
<i>and the severe brows.</i>

441
00:24:45.358 --> 00:24:49.446
<i>those proportions. it was hard</i>
<i>not to make him look like a jerk.</i>

442
00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:54.075
The biggest thing is.
in our film Buzz has hair.

443
00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:57.621
NOLTE: <i>We never saw Buzz Lightyear</i>
<i>without his... They call it a snood.</i>

444
00:24:57.704 --> 00:24:59.539
<i>the purple thing he wears on his head.</i>

445
00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:00.790
Thank goodness for Google.

446
00:25:00.874 --> 00:25:02.501
Snoods. I'm like. "What is that?"

447
00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:04.669
I look it up.
"Okay. that's what that is."

448
00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:07.756
MACLANE: <i>So he's got hair.</i>
<i>We work with the hair.</i>

449
00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:10.217
<i>The hair was first.</i>
<i>What's the hair gonna look like?</i>

450
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.677
<i>His chin is pretty defining.</i>
<i>Got to have the chin.</i>

451
00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:15.430
<i>He's got the little curly cue.</i>
<i>which is like a dimple chin.</i>

452
00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:16.848
<i>He's got big. round eyes.</i>

453
00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:19.768
<i>How do you work them</i>
<i>into the stylization of the world?</i>

454
00:25:20.143 --> 00:25:22.479
<i>He's got a barrel chest and narrow waist.</i>

455
00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:25.732
NOLTE: <i>What did he look like</i>
<i>underneath the space suit?</i>

456
00:25:26.483 --> 00:25:28.401
<i>And that was an exploration too.</i>

457
00:25:28.985 --> 00:25:31.571
<i>Angus wanted him to feel</i>
<i>a little bit more vulnerable.</i>

458
00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:32.781
<i>a little more relatable.</i>

459
00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:34.115
I can't get out of this.

460
00:25:34.616 --> 00:25:38.411
So I can't get a sense of...
I can't get any emotion out of it.

461
00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:40.497
Story-wise.
it's about the birth of a hero.

462
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.374
not a hero that became a bigger hero.

463
00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:47.712
I would start him off as John Glenn
and turn him into Han Solo.

464
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.759
The most difficult aspect is the head.
and you're totally nailing that.

465
00:25:53.677 --> 00:25:55.512
NOLTE: <i>Once we got approved in art.</i>

466
00:25:55.595 --> 00:25:59.099
that goes on into
the character modeling rig department.

467
00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:02.811
<i>Very. very. very collaborative discovery.</i>

468
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.776
<i>We just pass it around like a football.</i>
<i>always after the same goal of</i>

469
00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:12.696
<i>maintaining the appeal</i>
<i>that was in the original art</i>

470
00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:14.656
<i>but discovering new problems.</i>

471
00:26:15.782 --> 00:26:18.577
Just feeling a little harsh.
right in there.

472
00:26:19.828 --> 00:26:22.747
We've got an established character
that everyone knows and loves.

473
00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:27.919
<i>It was up to us to go back</i>
<i>and flesh out this whole world</i>

474
00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:29.879
<i>that we've never encountered.</i>

475
00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:33.174
<i>We've just got little bits and pieces</i>
<i>of it through toy Buzz.</i>

476
00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:38.054
<i>So we had tried a lot of different</i>
<i>callbacks and homages like Lunar Larry.</i>

477
00:26:38.138 --> 00:26:40.807
<i>That's where we get this</i>
<i>sort of orangish red color.</i>

478
00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:44.853
<i>We made sure to call back</i>
<i>to the original Buzz Lightyear suit.</i>

479
00:26:44.936 --> 00:26:48.064
<i>so we still have buttons on it.</i>
<i>got the wing logo.</i>

480
00:26:48.148 --> 00:26:50.275
<i>the wrist communicator.</i>
<i>all that stuff.</i>

481
00:26:50.358 --> 00:26:52.736
The gear. you know. Angus loves the gear.

482
00:26:52.819 --> 00:26:54.154
<i>He loves all the stuff.</i>

483
00:26:54.237 --> 00:26:56.323
We gave him lots of cool accessories.

484
00:26:58.533 --> 00:27:02.078
That he promptly loses immediately.
'cause that's what would really happen.

485
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.247
ALEXANDER: <i>Angus cares about everything.</i>

486
00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:08.376
And when I say he cares about everything.
literally everything.

487
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.547
NOLTE: <i>"Does that lever have</i>
<i>some sort of ribbing on it</i>

488
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:15.467
<i>"so your thumb would be</i>
<i>able to slide it easy?"</i>

489
00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:19.471
Whether it's how deep a panel line is or

490
00:27:19.554 --> 00:27:22.057
<i>even belt buckles. lots of belt buckles.</i>

491
00:27:29.856 --> 00:27:32.942
MACLANE: <i>I arrive at a picture</i>
<i>of the whole</i>

492
00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:35.278
through a series of connected details.

493
00:27:36.821 --> 00:27:38.698
<i>I really wanted things to be tactile.</i>

494
00:27:38.782 --> 00:27:42.285
<i>You should be able to feel</i>
<i>like you can touch this thing.</i>

495
00:27:42.369 --> 00:27:45.246
<i>Buttons. switches.</i>

496
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.875
More just making a world
that feels believable and lived in.

497
00:27:48.958 --> 00:27:51.419
That will allow
the emotional story to come forward.

498
00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:55.006
You might also see that he's.
through years of being an animator.

499
00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:58.426
is kind of obsessed with
the performance of hands in the movie.

500
00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:01.137
I'd be curious if we could build the hands

501
00:28:01.221 --> 00:28:03.765
so that the index finger was
aligned like that.

502
00:28:05.141 --> 00:28:08.770
Angus wants that hand to say
exactly what a character is feeling.

503
00:28:15.485 --> 00:28:19.531
To him. a hand pose can signify
how much power

504
00:28:19.614 --> 00:28:22.283
and strength a person has.

505
00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:24.536
<i>Depending on how you pose the thumb.</i>

506
00:28:24.619 --> 00:28:27.747
<i>it can show whether that person</i>
<i>is a strong character or not.</i>

507
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.629
MACLANE: <i>I like toys a lot.</i>

508
00:28:35.964 --> 00:28:37.716
<i>I have strong opinions about them.</i>

509
00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:43.513
<i>And so for a lot of the big ships.</i>
<i>I just built them out of LEGO bricks.</i>

510
00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:45.849
<i>I want something like this.</i>

511
00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:50.395
GREGORY PELTZ:
<i>LEGO bricks are Angus' medium.</i>

512
00:28:50.478 --> 00:28:52.564
<i>He does all these awesome mockups.</i>

513
00:28:52.647 --> 00:28:54.691
<i>Here's how he sketched it</i>
<i>out in LEGO bricks.</i>

514
00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:56.776
<i>And then I did my pass on it.</i>

515
00:29:00.363 --> 00:29:05.869
This is the 15th ship Buzz uses
to test this light speed fuel.

516
00:29:07.036 --> 00:29:09.956
PELTZ: <i>It's a movie that's full of</i>
<i>cool stuff to make toys out of.</i>

517
00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:12.417
<i>that was made by people who love toys.</i>

518
00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:15.170
This is the best one.
This is the best thing.

519
00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:20.800
And Angus remembers details
on movies that are insane.

520
00:29:20.884 --> 00:29:23.303
He has an encyclopedic
knowledge of cinema.

521
00:29:23.386 --> 00:29:26.097
Chased through a trolley graveyard.

522
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:29.642
Little more <i>Me. Myself and Irene.</i>
than <i>Raising Arizona.</i>

523
00:29:30.226 --> 00:29:31.853
Gandalf. "Fly. you fools."

524
00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:33.146
<i>Indiana Jones. Scooby-Doo.</i>

525
00:29:33.229 --> 00:29:34.481
<i>Shawshank. Beautiful Mind-ing it.</i>

526
00:29:34.564 --> 00:29:36.608
You need to <i>Double Impact</i> it a little bit.

527
00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:37.942
Like. he remembers...

528
00:29:38.985 --> 00:29:39.986
not just lines.

529
00:29:40.069 --> 00:29:42.155
No. Kaa from <i>Jungle Book...</i>

530
00:29:42.238 --> 00:29:43.281
HEADLEY: Sorry. I'll use his name

531
00:29:43.364 --> 00:29:45.366
...that's a different animation cycle.
That's like...

532
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:49.037
HEADLEY: <i>He remembers the timing</i>
<i>of where roughly it happens in a movie.</i>

533
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.165
He's like. "I think it was at
two minutes into the second act.

534
00:29:52.248 --> 00:29:54.542
"you'll see this happen
and this musical cue."

535
00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:56.795
And you're like.
"Wow. that's so specific."

536
00:29:56.878 --> 00:29:59.047
A million small details
that you have to focus on.

537
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.424
<i>and you can make all</i>
<i>of the elements awesome.</i>

538
00:30:01.508 --> 00:30:04.260
And then when you watch the movie.
it may not be awesome.

539
00:30:04.344 --> 00:30:06.346
<i>There are a million things</i>
<i>that can go wrong.</i>

540
00:30:06.429 --> 00:30:07.722
<i>and you won't even know.</i>

541
00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:09.140
<i>It's a crazy. crazy thing.</i>

542
00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:11.267
It's wonderful and it's horrible.

543
00:30:11.601 --> 00:30:12.811
All directors go insane.

544
00:30:17.607 --> 00:30:21.277
<i>The first thing I directed was a play</i>
<i>when I was in kindergarten.</i>

545
00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:25.281
<i>And I have to say I may have obsessed</i>
<i>a little bit too much about the costumes.</i>

546
00:30:26.574 --> 00:30:30.245
Even though there weren't swords involved
in <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.</i>

547
00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:32.580
in my version. there were a lot of swords.

548
00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:39.587
Design and acting and performing
and movies was just my thing.

549
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.218
I was really obsessed with things.

550
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.972
When I finally came to Pixar.

551
00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:51.182
I wasn't the only one.

552
00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:55.228
<i>Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.</i>
<i>Come in. Star Command.</i>

553
00:31:10.577 --> 00:31:13.079
HEADLEY: <i>I have a working theory</i>
<i>on storytelling.</i>

554
00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:15.290
<i>and why we enjoy stories. is because</i>

555
00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:18.543
primarily we're dumb
and we can't remember things.

556
00:31:18.626 --> 00:31:23.256
And so we need to have the same lessons
taught to us over and over again.

557
00:31:23.756 --> 00:31:25.341
<i>so that we remember to be decent.</i>

558
00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:28.261
<i>and we remember that</i>
<i>we're a part of a community.</i>

559
00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:33.975
<i>And it's certainly a way that I learn</i>
<i>and carry things with me through life.</i>

560
00:31:35.018 --> 00:31:37.896
SUSMAN: <i>I was always driven</i>
<i>by making a picture.</i>

561
00:31:38.187 --> 00:31:41.900
But there was something about
the collaboration of different skills

562
00:31:41.983 --> 00:31:46.529
<i>that come together when you do a film</i>
<i>that was just so much more</i>

563
00:31:46.613 --> 00:31:49.657
rewarding and entertaining.

564
00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:53.536
<i>and I could see doing that</i>
<i>every day for the rest of my life.</i>

565
00:31:54.537 --> 00:31:56.623
When you've worked at Pixar for 10 years.

566
00:31:56.706 --> 00:32:01.294
you get a really cool bronze statue
of Buzz Lightyear.

567
00:32:03.838 --> 00:32:08.092
PETE: <i>Buzz represents</i>
<i>a certain amount of tradition.</i>

568
00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:09.928
<i>but he's also kind of the new guy.</i>

569
00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:13.806
There's something so aspirational
about Buzz.

570
00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:19.187
<i>If you want to acknowledge a decade spent</i>

571
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:23.107
and at the same time say.
"To infinity and beyond."

572
00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:25.234
you've got lots more to do together.

573
00:32:25.318 --> 00:32:27.570
what better character than Buzz?

574
00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:43.461
EVANS: <i>Gonna say it like the classic.</i>

575
00:32:43.544 --> 00:32:44.921
<i>-"To infinity..."</i>
-EVANS: <i>Sure.</i>

576
00:32:45.254 --> 00:32:47.465
To infinity and beyond!

577
00:32:52.512 --> 00:32:54.097
No one can touch Tim Allen. really.

578
00:33:00.436 --> 00:33:02.689
Question. Are we saying...
Because as a...

579
00:33:02.772 --> 00:33:05.483
Just so we're clear about it.
now is an admission section.

580
00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:06.776
As a <i>Toy Story</i> fan...

581
00:33:12.782 --> 00:33:16.661
Are we saying it like the way Buzz...

582
00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:17.954
Okay. Copy.

583
00:33:23.126 --> 00:33:24.293
"To infinity..."

584
00:33:26.754 --> 00:33:29.132
<i>Sorry. I'm so sorry.</i>

585
00:33:30.717 --> 00:33:32.802
I'm excited. That was just a good one.

586
00:33:32.927 --> 00:33:34.554
(LAUGHS)

587
00:33:34.637 --> 00:33:37.640
Sorry. I couldn't even continue.
I was like...

588
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.983
Oh. my gosh.

589
00:33:54.115 --> 00:33:55.324
<i>It's crazy.</i>

590
00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:05.793
I sort of come out wild. OMG.
