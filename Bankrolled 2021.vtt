00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:25.400
DON'T TALK. ACT.

5
00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.738
RISE AND SHINE!

6
00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.410
Today is your successful day.

7
00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.888
I'm leaving.
I'm working on some cool projects.

8
00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:38.848
-Really?
-I'll tell you more later. You?

9
00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.226
-I'm meeting some clients.
-Nice. Hang on.

10
00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:43.520
-What is it?
-An eyelash.

11
00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:44.896
-Thanks.
-Let's kill it!

12
00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.899
-Love you. bye!
-You too. man.

13
00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:49.109
-Bye!
-That's it!.

14
00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:03.123
What the fuck!

15
00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:07.293
Come on. man. You can't do that.

16
00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:10.004
-Didn't you have things to do?
-Let's just say that--

17
00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.423
-Weren't you going to--?
-That changed.

18
00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.884
My clients canceled at the last minute.

19
00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.971
Sit down. I'm watching a cool documentary.

20
00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:19.764
Really cool.

21
00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:22.350
We get rewarded
by likes. hearts. followers

22
00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:24.561
and we conflate that with value and truth.

23
00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:28.022
We were naive
about the consequences of social media.

24
00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:31.860
New generations are growing up
more anxious. more depressed.

25
00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:34.696
We created a monster
and we have to stop it.

26
00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.156
What are we doing?

27
00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:37.657
What?

28
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.077
I came to the big city with big hopes.

29
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:41.995
Now look at me.

30
00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.169
You seem fine. man.

31
00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:56.968
When I started my company.

32
00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:59.429
people laughed because I was just a kid.

33
00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:01.347
Still. I left school

34
00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.309
to pursue my dream
of making edible containers.

35
00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.312
Today. my business is valued at

36
00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.564
10 million pesos.

37
00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.901
And what have you done?

38
00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:17.947
Bummer.

39
00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.117
Damn.

40
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.411
At 12 he's achieved more than us at 28.

41
00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:24.787
-30.
-What?

42
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:25.914
We're 30. dude.

43
00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:28.708
Fuck. you're right.

44
00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:32.462
Childhood used to be about
learning how not to piss the bed.

45
00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:36.174
How to ride a pony.
how to escape from the priest.

46
00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:40.178
I just got an invitation from Cano
for the start-up mixer.

47
00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.847
-Invite your girlfriend.
-We need to network.

48
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.892
When are you going to realize
that I don't network?

49
00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.353
He's the Mark Cuban of Mexico.

50
00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:52.482
-He has an investment fund.
-You're going to pitch your idiotic ideas

51
00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:55.652
-like an app to tell if a melon is fresh?
-No. they beat us to it.

52
00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.947
Melon-meter. available on iPhone
and Android. 200.000 downloads.

53
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.823
-Wow.
-That sucks.

54
00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:04.619
Dude.

55
00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:05.703
What?

56
00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:08.248
The last time we did this. you got upset.

57
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.124
-What?
-You got upset.

58
00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:13.544
-We made a lot of contacts.
-It bothers you when others do well.

59
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.258
Fine. but at least I don't have

60
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:21.886
a superiority complex
disguised as not giving a fuck.

61
00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.514
Okay. man.

62
00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.474
I just want us to be a success.

63
00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:30.311
The only thing I want
is to live in Cadaqués. in Catalonia.

64
00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.647
read Gaudí's biography and drink espresso.

65
00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.817
What? I'm learning Catalan.

66
00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:37.902
No. dude.

67
00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:39.487
Right.

68
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.781
we're having dinner
with your parents tonight.

69
00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.950
Why are you texting my parents?

70
00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:45.285
-They're awesome.
-They suck.

71
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:49.539
A proper meal would do you well
instead of eating instant noodles.

72
00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:53.251
That shit causes cancer.
I'm surprised you do that.

73
00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:00.967
All right.

74
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.428
I haven't had noodles in a while.

75
00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.722
Please don't judge me.

76
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.515
Money is tight.

77
00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:11.436
Capitalism is killing us all.

78
00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:13.688
You need money to be vegetarian.

79
00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:18.484
Imagine you're in Tulum.

80
00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:20.445
You're ripped.

81
00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.697
You're gorgeous.

82
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.659
Rise above the haters. Let's give love.

83
00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:29.954
Let's shine.
because we are here to give love.

84
00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:32.373
Let the bike make love to you.

85
00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:34.459
Come on. fatty. Tulum.

86
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.799
You're getting to the beach.

87
00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.259
you're gorgeous.

88
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.178
I want to see your butts up.

89
00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.722
And one and two!

90
00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:52.310
Caress your butt.
I want to see your rectal selfie.

91
00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:53.311
Yes. breathe.

92
00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:55.480
I like it! That's it!

93
00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.565
What's wrong? A little more.

94
00:05:57.648 --> 00:05:59.192
Up. Down.

95
00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:02.779
That's it!
I weighed 130 fucking kilograms!

96
00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:06.032
Now look at me!

97
00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:07.617
What a great butt!

98
00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:10.578
I have your bill.

99
00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:13.873
It's 3.000 plus the personal trainer.

100
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:24.217
Declined. Do you have another one?

101
00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:30.765
I don't know.

102
00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.226
Can I pay with points?

103
00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.144
With what?

104
00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.355
How embarrassing. In front of everyone.

105
00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:40.024
The bills for the apartment added up.

106
00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:43.319
Keep supporting that mooch.
he doesn't share your goals.

107
00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:48.616
Babe.

108
00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:56.999
Hello.

109
00:06:57.708 --> 00:07:01.421
I was wondering
if you've looked at my job application.

110
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:02.797
What's your order?

111
00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:04.841
All right.

112
00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.926
The coffee of the day.

113
00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:07.885
That's 120.

114
00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.018
Are you on the waiting list?

115
00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.312
No but I left my resume.

116
00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:19.313
And I--

117
00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:21.149
Borealis.

118
00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:24.402
They said I needed a resume.

119
00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:25.820
they never said--

120
00:07:25.903 --> 00:07:29.657
Put your name here. This is
the waiting list for the waiting list.

121
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.951
Why not have one long waiting list?

122
00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:37.039
Thanks.

123
00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:42.420
Excuse me.
This is watery and over-extracted.

124
00:07:42.503 --> 00:07:45.882
I would have ground it much finer.
the roast is burnt.

125
00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:49.135
No. it's a Chiapas natural.
triple extracted.

126
00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:50.344
It tastes like wood.

127
00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.597
It's not fruity. considering it's natural.

128
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.141
Tell your supplier.
it's not all your fault.

129
00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:56.642
Next. please.

130
00:07:58.227 --> 00:07:59.061
Hello.

131
00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:02.023
Bitcoin was revolutionary
because it created digital scarcity.

132
00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:03.733
Like gold. it's finite.

133
00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:06.736
They were using it
to buy drugs or to traffic organs.

134
00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.571
No. it's all regulated now.

135
00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:10.323
-Carlos.
-Hello.

136
00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:11.949
-Sorry.
-Charlie.

137
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.160
Sorry. we were filming.

138
00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:17.079
-What are you filming?
-His son opening toys.

139
00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:19.499
Unboxing. Sweet gig.

140
00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:21.542
-Right?
-Yeah.

141
00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:25.004
Rocco must have a blast
with all those toys.

142
00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:27.924
The lady from ToyCity
only lends them to me for a bit.

143
00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:31.135
My dad will give me a Lego
at 100.000 subscribers.

144
00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.762
Yeah. Almost.

145
00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.306
We're growing our audience.

146
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:36.224
Sure.

147
00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.226
How's it going?

148
00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:42.480
Great. We're very happy.
we're working on various projects.

149
00:08:42.563 --> 00:08:44.774
Are you over the desire to make coffee?

150
00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:46.651
It's not making coffee.

151
00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:48.778
Being a barista is an art. dad.

152
00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:51.572
Why don't you get a normal job?

153
00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.032
-Okay.
-My friends post

154
00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:55.785
their kids accomplishments
on Facebook everyday.

155
00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:57.328
Manú Montoya

156
00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:58.913
is a lawyer at Pfizer.

157
00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:01.707
Pili Bracho is at Deutsche Bank.

158
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.086
And you. making hearts in cappuccinos.

159
00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:10.007
You work for a bakery that causes
most of the country's diabetes.

160
00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:11.425
You're part of the problem.

161
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:15.012
The world
isn't made of dreams and nonsense.

162
00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.764
A man needs to work--

163
00:09:16.847 --> 00:09:19.684
Who says that a man needs to work?

164
00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:22.353
That is a neoliberal way
to control the masses.

165
00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.981
Money is an imaginary concept.

166
00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:27.567
That's why Mom gives you money.

167
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.778
-How convenient.
-Well…

168
00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.325
The rice is delicious.

169
00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:37.910
Like always.

170
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.328
I'm glad you like it.

171
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:48.379
Your Dad is right.
You'll starve as a barista.

172
00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:50.506
At least I'll be happy.

173
00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:52.925
Polo Ríos.

174
00:09:53.884 --> 00:09:57.430
Forget about that nonsense.
we're going to start a business.

175
00:09:57.513 --> 00:09:58.347
Come in.

176
00:09:58.806 --> 00:09:59.640
Thanks.

177
00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.606
This is the type of place
we need to be at.

178
00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:09.317
I bought half of Isla Holbox.
So. what's the problem?

179
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.736
It's sinking and all.
but there are no animals.

180
00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:14.280
I'm thinking
of bringing animals to Holbox.

181
00:10:14.363 --> 00:10:15.865
Like Jurassic Park.

182
00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:17.408
But no dinosaurs.

183
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:19.744
Giraffes. tigers. crocodiles. hippos…

184
00:10:19.827 --> 00:10:20.661
Cano!

185
00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:23.497
-What's up?
-Polo!

186
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.584
How are you?

187
00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:28.753
Killing it. like always.

188
00:10:28.836 --> 00:10:32.214
And you? Did you lose weight?
What did you do?

189
00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:34.383
Keto and spinning class.

190
00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.552
And a little gastric bypass.

191
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:37.637
Blas.

192
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.930
As pale and sarcastic as always.

193
00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:41.932
Are you still being austere?

194
00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:42.892
A minimalist.

195
00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:44.560
Cool. What are you up to?

196
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.938
We're working on some projects
that are very disruptive.

197
00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:50.941
-That's not true.
-I always knew you'd get far.

198
00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:55.738
-We actually have some ideas.
-I love ideas.

199
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:57.990
I'm the type of guy that loves ideas.

200
00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:03.037
but right now I have to tell my secretary
and she'll tell me. okay?

201
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.122
Keep having a great time.

202
00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:06.832
You're so skinny dude!

203
00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:10.044
-Hello. I--
-Excuse me.

204
00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:13.798
Let's get some drinks.

205
00:11:15.716 --> 00:11:17.802
-Good evening.
-Hello.

206
00:11:17.885 --> 00:11:19.512
Carajillo. please.

207
00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:21.347
-A light beer. please.
-Sure.

208
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.265
With a little mineral water.

209
00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:26.519
Sandra thinks I've gained weight.

210
00:11:26.602 --> 00:11:30.106
You've lost 90 kilos.
You survived the war with gluten.

211
00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:33.275
You're an example for the fat community
that defends itself

212
00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:36.487
from the explosion of sugary products
made by multinationals.

213
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.781
which don't care about you
or public health.

214
00:11:39.323 --> 00:11:40.282
Accept yourself.

215
00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:44.537
What is this?

216
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.373
Mr. Cano's special edition of Esprezzo.

217
00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:48.999
-Shit in my mouth.
-What?

218
00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:51.585
He drank formula as a baby. Two mezcals.

219
00:11:53.003 --> 00:11:54.964
Sorry. it's clinical.

220
00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:56.757
Thanks.

221
00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:57.717
Cheers.

222
00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:04.515
-No way. there's a ping-pong room.
-Where?

223
00:12:04.598 --> 00:12:07.685
-I don't see a ping-pong table.
-No. ping-pong is just a saying.

224
00:12:07.768 --> 00:12:09.895
I bounce an idea back and forth.

225
00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.690
You're so embarrassing.

226
00:12:12.773 --> 00:12:14.775
-Why? It's a saying.
-Sure.

227
00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:16.902
Aderales?

228
00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.156
No way!

229
00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.660
It's so good to see you.

230
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.621
Blas. you're so small. How cute.

231
00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:29.832
Drug dealing is going well for you.

232
00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:32.960
Wow. They aren't drugs. man.

233
00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:35.296
They're nootropics.

234
00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:38.758
Armodafinil. dextro.
stimulants for productivity.

235
00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.718
None of this recreational shit.

236
00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:42.595
-Okay.
-Sure.

237
00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:45.139
You'd be amazed
at how focused it makes you.

238
00:12:45.222 --> 00:12:47.391
Imagine Bradley Cooper in "Limitless"

239
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:50.019
combined with Russell Crowe
in "A Beautiful Mind" and

240
00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:54.023
Matt Damon in "The Talented Mr. Ripley"
happening microscopically

241
00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:58.068
in Stephen Hawking's semen.
inside Carl Sagan's uterus.

242
00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:00.112
It's Ukrainian Ritalin.

243
00:13:00.988 --> 00:13:03.491
I've heard of this.
It's banned in a lot of places.

244
00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:07.620
-Elon Musk invented Tesla on this.
-And the cybertruck and flamethrower.

245
00:13:07.703 --> 00:13:10.206
I know because
Elon is my friend and client.

246
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.333
Do you have my app?

247
00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:14.835
Download my app. Here.

248
00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.962
I accept Bitcoin. Ethereum.

249
00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:19.131
Aders. Not the peso. that's tacky.

250
00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:20.716
What is Aders?

251
00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:22.802
My cryptocurrency.

252
00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:25.721
Aderales. Aders.
What is your cryptocurrency called?

253
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.813
Hey! These guys don't have
their own cryptocurrency.

254
00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:38.651
That's okay. Not everyone does.

255
00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:40.528
Just everyone here.

256
00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:41.529
Cheers.

257
00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:42.446
No way. man.

258
00:13:43.113 --> 00:13:44.615
Even Aderales has an app.

259
00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:48.536
He's an idiot.
he tattooed the bar code on his neck.

260
00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.788
-That's 100% brand confidence.
-No.

261
00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:53.374
-We could learn something from him.
-No.

262
00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:56.126
They're all ahead of us.

263
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.419
Don't start.

264
00:13:57.503 --> 00:14:00.297
Everybody is doing something.

265
00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:03.342
-All right.
-We haven't done anything. We're losers.

266
00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.052
Polo. no!

267
00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.013
-What are you doing?
-We're 30.

268
00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:11.725
I don't know what to do with my life.
I have a gray hair on my balls.

269
00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:14.478
-Calm down.
-I live with diarrhea.

270
00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:17.189
-We all have gray hair and diarrhea.
-What do I do?

271
00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.275
Everybody in this country has diarrhea.

272
00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:21.694
He's going to puke.

273
00:14:21.777 --> 00:14:23.904
Watch out! Sorry!

274
00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:26.782
What will my grandma say
if I go back broken?

275
00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.826
You're not going back. relax.

276
00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:31.412
We don't have any revenue.
I'm losing my hair.

277
00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:33.622
You're not losing your hair. relax.

278
00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:36.709
What will make you feel better?

279
00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:38.794
-Promise we'll be successful.
-I promise.

280
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.838
-Promise.
-I promise.

281
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:42.715
-You can do this.
-Okay.

282
00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:44.133
Come on!

283
00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:45.759
-You're the shit.
-Yeah.

284
00:14:47.511 --> 00:14:51.056
Let's come together. please.

285
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.476
Networking and all is good.
but we are a community.

286
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.186
How are we going to unite?

287
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.564
We're going to get shitfaced!

288
00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:02.693
Get your phones out quickly.

289
00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:06.030
We're going to google our names
or our artistic names.

290
00:15:06.113 --> 00:15:08.616
-Really?
-You said you'd do anything.

291
00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:11.160
Raise your hand
if there's less than 10 000 hits.

292
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.331
Drink!

293
00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:23.380
Raise your hand
if you're not verified on Instagram.

294
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:29.929
Who doesn't
have a picture with Bill Gates?

295
00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:31.931
Who would have that?

296
00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:33.307
I tried.

297
00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:43.525
Sell me the pen. You wanted to ping-pong.

298
00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.987
It's very elegant. It's a Mont Blanc.

299
00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:48.697
Take a shot.

300
00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:01.794
I'm an idiot. Kill me. please.
I fucked it up.

301
00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:04.880
I fucked it all up.

302
00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:06.423
Come on.

303
00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.968
You don't need that idiot to make it.

304
00:16:09.426 --> 00:16:11.428
-Why'd we study marketing?
-I don't know.

305
00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:13.597
-What a bullshit degree.
-That doesn't matter.

306
00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:15.349
How hard can it be to get money?

307
00:16:18.435 --> 00:16:20.729
-Are we ping-ponging?
-No. man.

308
00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:24.024
-We're ping-ponging.
-No. we're not.

309
00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:26.944
I love the initiative.
That's what we need.

310
00:16:27.027 --> 00:16:28.862
-Polo. please.
-Write this down.

311
00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:30.072
Do you have a pen?

312
00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:32.574
-What do people like?
-Vacations?

313
00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.618
Airbnb. Trip Advisor. Lonely Planet.

314
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:36.662
Hospitality is very saturated.

315
00:16:36.745 --> 00:16:37.871
Okay. then sex.

316
00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:41.291
Tinder. Bumble. Grindr. Match. Badoo--
Should I go on?

317
00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:43.585
Nature. pets.

318
00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:46.547
-Good causes.
-Okay. maybe.

319
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.549
-Slides.
-We're getting there.

320
00:16:48.632 --> 00:16:52.761
An app that finds the closest slide.
Genius!

321
00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:55.139
Look at your digital guru friends.

322
00:16:55.222 --> 00:16:59.893
They crave attention.
they like to think they're great people.

323
00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:03.647
Status. attention. relevance.
That's great.

324
00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:07.526
I wouldn't give up on the slides.
that sounds good.

325
00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:10.154
Good morning. fatty!

326
00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.037
Hi. babe.

327
00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:19.580
Seriously?

328
00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:24.960
You smell like vomit and tequila. Gross.

329
00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:27.838
-Cappuccino?
-You'd make my day.

330
00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:30.883
-Babe.
-I'll change.

331
00:17:30.966 --> 00:17:32.843
-You were drinking? Really?
-No.

332
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.221
You're disgusting. Have some self-love.

333
00:17:36.805 --> 00:17:38.474
-Do you do anything?
-No.

334
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.059
We won't make it.

335
00:17:42.102 --> 00:17:43.479
-Babe.
-What?

336
00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:45.522
Maybe put on something looser?

337
00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:47.357
That doesn't fit you yet.

338
00:17:48.275 --> 00:17:49.651
Right.

339
00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:52.571
It fits him.

340
00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:55.240
Not yet.

341
00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:56.784
-Yes it does.
-No.

342
00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:58.619
-It fits.
-No. it doesn't.

343
00:18:02.122 --> 00:18:03.123
Let's go.

344
00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:05.834
Thank you.

345
00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.461
What are we doing?

346
00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:10.589
Running this morning.
Then seaweed therapy.

347
00:18:10.672 --> 00:18:14.134
Then belly injections.
I know it hurts. but it's good for you.

348
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:22.810
Let's go. fatty.

349
00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:28.857
BANKROLLED

350
00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:30.526
-Come on.
-I'm coming.

351
00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:35.030
You won't believe what happened.
There's a video on Bankrolled.

352
00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:36.281
-What?
-I'll explain.

353
00:18:37.991 --> 00:18:40.369
SignNow is a platform for social impact

354
00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:42.788
that will revolutionize
how you sign petitions.

355
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:46.500
Save the gorillas. say bye to bullying.
fight poverty.

356
00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:48.043
all with one click.

357
00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.629
Signing petitions has never been so fun.

358
00:18:50.712 --> 00:18:53.132
Play. collect trophies
emojis and have fun.

359
00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:55.968
All of your friends
will know what you sign.

360
00:18:56.051 --> 00:18:57.886
By playing. you'll get points.

361
00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.264
Show everyone who signs the most.

362
00:19:00.347 --> 00:19:02.599
Support and fund SignNow.

363
00:19:02.724 --> 00:19:04.017
SIGNNOW

364
00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:05.936
What the fuck is this?

365
00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:08.355
Parallel universe.
that's the only explanation.

366
00:19:08.438 --> 00:19:10.065
Don't start.

367
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:13.235
Then tell me when did we make this?

368
00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.073
I wouldn't give up on the slides.

369
00:19:19.074 --> 00:19:20.701
It's not a bad idea.

370
00:19:20.784 --> 00:19:22.661
-Not bad.
-Not a bad idea.

371
00:19:22.744 --> 00:19:25.289
-We're going to kill it.
-That's right.

372
00:19:25.372 --> 00:19:27.332
-Fucking right.
-We're going to kill it.

373
00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:33.213
You'd be amazed
at how focused it makes you.

374
00:19:33.297 --> 00:19:36.008
I've heard about this.
It's banned in a lot of places.

375
00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:37.593
Elon Musk invented Tesla on this.

376
00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:38.886
It's Ukrainian Ritalin.

377
00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:49.438
If we can make the sneakers
from "Back to the Future".

378
00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:51.982
-That's idiotic.
-There are no idiotic ideas.

379
00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:55.027
-The idea is to--
-Okay.

380
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.112
-An anti-fart diaper.
-A diaper.

381
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.698
-A joint holder.
-Plant locators?

382
00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:01.200
No.

383
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.244
-Did it hit you?
-No.

384
00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:13.754
Fucking Aderales.

385
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.681
Stimulants for productivity.
Nothing recreational.

386
00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:11.687
What the hell are we--

387
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.481
This is the most idiotic thing
we've ever done.

388
00:21:14.564 --> 00:21:16.566
Hold on. it's not bad.

389
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.068
Yes. it's bad.

390
00:21:18.151 --> 00:21:18.986
No.

391
00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:21.530
We're obviously being sarcastic.

392
00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:24.199
-Why is it already 12% funded then?
-It's clicktivism.

393
00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:28.412
It's the stupidest form of social justice.

394
00:21:28.495 --> 00:21:30.706
-You lack imagination.
-No.

395
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:33.792
It's a starting point.
A lot of startups begin like this.

396
00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:36.336
-They pivot later.
-I don't want to start a startup.

397
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.338
The word startup makes me anxious.

398
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:41.633
Someone just gave 50 000 pesos.

399
00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:43.969
-Really?
-Yeah.

400
00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:50.225
There are people that wait
for an opportunity like this.

401
00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:52.185
-Don't you think it means something?
-Yes.

402
00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:54.521
That we were drunk. high and desperate.

403
00:21:54.604 --> 00:21:57.065
This is what we need
for our personal brands.

404
00:21:57.149 --> 00:22:00.193
I want to enjoy
what little time I have in this world.

405
00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:02.738
Which doesn't matter.
because this is all a simulation.

406
00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:05.490
You need to stay off of Reddit.

407
00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:08.368
We have no idea how to make an app.

408
00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:10.954
You and I. quickly. Jobs-Wozniak.

409
00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:12.998
I don't want to rush. Who is who?

410
00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:16.460
-I'm the face. you're the brains.
-I've never programmed anything.

411
00:22:16.543 --> 00:22:19.087
You're very creative.
You can pull this off.

412
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:21.548
Mixing friendship and work is not cool.

413
00:22:21.631 --> 00:22:24.009
We live together. we're basically married.

414
00:22:24.092 --> 00:22:25.260
-No. we're not.
-Basically.

415
00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:26.386
What could go wrong?

416
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.181
I don't feel comfortable
using other people's money.

417
00:22:29.723 --> 00:22:31.975
Want to get your dad off your back?

418
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.615
Tell them I won't travel
if it's not in first class.

419
00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:50.160
I want to try veganism.
switch out the fridge. Leave the M&Ms.

420
00:22:50.243 --> 00:22:51.411
Okay. guys.

421
00:22:51.995 --> 00:22:55.707
The landing page of Bankrolled is dead.

422
00:22:56.249 --> 00:22:58.418
What's going on?

423
00:22:58.502 --> 00:23:00.170
Give me ideas. Shoot.

424
00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:01.463
Paleo snacks.

425
00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:04.925
Sponsored by Bárbara de Regil.
that's all she eats.

426
00:23:05.008 --> 00:23:06.134
No.

427
00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:09.471
-Shoot.
-A dating app for people on Keto.

428
00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:11.431
-It's called "Ketinder".
-Next.

429
00:23:11.515 --> 00:23:12.516
Tell me.

430
00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:14.643
Crowdfunding is so 2015.

431
00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:16.686
Mayte. less negativity.

432
00:23:17.312 --> 00:23:20.148
Crowdfunding is the new economy.

433
00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:23.902
I don't know if you realized
but you work for a crowdfunding platform.

434
00:23:25.445 --> 00:23:26.780
-Go on.
-Don't start.

435
00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:28.615
-Tell him.
-Nat.

436
00:23:30.283 --> 00:23:31.493
You have something to say?

437
00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:33.787
No.

438
00:23:34.287 --> 00:23:35.664
Tell me everything.

439
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:40.252
-There are two guys starting a project.
-Yeah?

440
00:23:40.335 --> 00:23:42.838
It's a platform for petition signing.

441
00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:44.840
but also a social network.

442
00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:48.427
And it's a game.
where you connect dots and win points.

443
00:23:50.178 --> 00:23:52.514
You're saying
there is an app that combines

444
00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:56.101
Change.org.
with Facebook. with Candy Crush?

445
00:23:56.184 --> 00:23:59.187
Yes. that's basically SignNow.
Sorry. how stupid--

446
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:01.022
Revolutionary.

447
00:24:01.648 --> 00:24:02.899
I love it.

448
00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:04.943
That's what we needed.

449
00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:06.069
He loves it.

450
00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:09.322
Compassionate. commercial and fun.

451
00:24:09.823 --> 00:24:11.408
That's what people want.

452
00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:14.327
Can you do it or should they?

453
00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:16.830
-We can do it.
-Of course she can.

454
00:24:16.913 --> 00:24:18.498
100%. I can do it.

455
00:24:18.582 --> 00:24:22.002
That's it. cancel all other projects.

456
00:24:22.085 --> 00:24:24.588
We're giving all of our support to this.

457
00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:26.548
Not all of our support. maybe--

458
00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:28.091
-Nat.
-Yes.

459
00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:29.968
There is no margin for error.

460
00:24:30.677 --> 00:24:32.971
-Bankrolled is in your hands. Bye.
-No.

461
00:24:33.054 --> 00:24:34.764
Gus. this is very--

462
00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:37.142
If this doesn't give Bankrolled a boost

463
00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:39.853
there will be bankruptcy
and mass lay-offs.

464
00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:41.813
-No more juice guy.
-Not Sergio.

465
00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:44.524
No more juice guy.
And I promised him a Tesla.

466
00:24:47.444 --> 00:24:49.279
Susy. Karen. let's go!

467
00:24:50.864 --> 00:24:52.032
He loved it.

468
00:24:52.115 --> 00:24:55.118
-You're the shit!
-No.

469
00:24:55.202 --> 00:24:56.036
What?

470
00:24:56.578 --> 00:24:58.538
You don't understand.

471
00:24:58.622 --> 00:25:01.708
I can't breathe or think.
My vision is blurry.

472
00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:05.128
-I don't have time.
-It hasn't even been a minute.

473
00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:07.672
-It's your fault. Mayte.
-Calm down.

474
00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:09.382
I can't take on so much.

475
00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:12.344
It's like submerging
your head in something.

476
00:25:12.427 --> 00:25:14.513
I just can't.

477
00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:18.600
This is the opportunity
you wanted to move up. Get excited.

478
00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:20.727
I'm very excited. Mayte.

479
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.103
Clearly.

480
00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:26.775
Gus said the future of the company
depends on me. I can't fuck up.

481
00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:29.528
-Breathe.
-I'm breathing.

482
00:25:29.611 --> 00:25:31.154
-You're hysterical.
-No.

483
00:25:31.238 --> 00:25:35.242
I'm fine. I feel calm and in control.

484
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:37.577
I'm fine. Let's breathe?

485
00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:39.162
Come on.

486
00:25:39.246 --> 00:25:42.374
Breathe with your heart and leave behind

487
00:25:42.457 --> 00:25:45.168
all of the anxiety caused by uncertainty.

488
00:25:45.252 --> 00:25:46.670
That shit doesn't work.

489
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.346
Hello.
We have a meeting with Natalia Quintana.

490
00:25:56.429 --> 00:25:57.389
One moment.

491
00:25:57.472 --> 00:26:00.392
Hey. Motivation Nation.
We're streaming live from--

492
00:26:00.475 --> 00:26:02.894
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

493
00:26:02.978 --> 00:26:05.355
As an influencer.
I have to constantly create content.

494
00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:07.607
A story. then a post.

495
00:26:07.691 --> 00:26:09.651
-Or just buy followers.
-Wow.

496
00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.571
You don't buy followers.

497
00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:15.574
Do you know
how many followers die in India?

498
00:26:15.657 --> 00:26:16.533
What?

499
00:26:16.616 --> 00:26:19.661
They make thousands of kids
follow accounts like yours

500
00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:22.789
in an unventilated warehouse.
They faint three times a day.

501
00:26:22.872 --> 00:26:24.457
How would you know that?

502
00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:26.042
I read.

503
00:26:26.126 --> 00:26:29.087
Hello. how are you? I'm Natalia Quintana.

504
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:30.797
Thanks for coming.

505
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.925
Do you want coffee. tea. matcha?

506
00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:36.136
We can validate your parking.

507
00:26:36.219 --> 00:26:39.097
Maybe no one offered
to validate your parking yet.

508
00:26:39.639 --> 00:26:41.933
Never mind. Come in. please.

509
00:26:42.017 --> 00:26:43.476
-This way.
-Sure.

510
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.437
Look. they have pool.

511
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:50.150
I'm excited to work with
people that are so professional…

512
00:26:50.233 --> 00:26:52.777
-Thank you. Sit down.
-…and innovative.

513
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:53.903
Thanks for coming.

514
00:26:53.987 --> 00:26:57.240
Especially because of all the recent
fiascos and scams

515
00:26:57.324 --> 00:26:59.993
that have fucked the platform's image.

516
00:27:00.076 --> 00:27:01.286
Look at this.

517
00:27:01.369 --> 00:27:03.830
This ended up
being a campaign for a cartel.

518
00:27:03.913 --> 00:27:05.457
Thanks. Bankrolled.

519
00:27:08.335 --> 00:27:11.421
And these were VR headsets that exploded.

520
00:27:11.504 --> 00:27:13.214
-They didn't explode.
-They did.

521
00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:17.427
-Seaweed! I love how it--
-Crunches?

522
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.928
-I love it.
-Really?

523
00:27:19.012 --> 00:27:21.765
-It's fun and--
-Exactly.

524
00:27:21.848 --> 00:27:23.516
It's like--

525
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.809
Yes.

526
00:27:26.436 --> 00:27:29.230
Tell me. what step are you at?

527
00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:32.942
It's going very well.
We're happy to work with you.

528
00:27:33.026 --> 00:27:35.445
-It's moving forward super well.
-Great.

529
00:27:35.528 --> 00:27:38.490
I looked you up on LinkedIn

530
00:27:38.573 --> 00:27:41.159
and I couldn't find you.

531
00:27:41.743 --> 00:27:43.244
It's under construction.

532
00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:45.163
I hate social media.

533
00:27:45.246 --> 00:27:49.125
He hates it right now
because he's so immersed in the project.

534
00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:51.002
His commitment is admirable.

535
00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:54.589
Good. then you can have
a demo ready in three weeks?

536
00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:58.051
-There's no way--
-That we won't. You can count on it.

537
00:27:58.718 --> 00:27:59.761
Perfect.

538
00:28:00.428 --> 00:28:02.847
That's the level of commitment we need.

539
00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:05.058
because that's what we are like.

540
00:28:05.141 --> 00:28:07.602
We're going to get along great. right?

541
00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:10.063
-Obviously.
-No need to say more.

542
00:28:10.146 --> 00:28:11.856
Cheers.

543
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.942
-I just--
-love it.

544
00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:16.736
Bankrolled. your crowdfunding platform.

545
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.156

It's incredible.

557
00:28:49.102 --> 00:28:50.353
If only I had words.

558
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.647
They're here.

559
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:55.316
SignNow in the house!

560
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.901
Let's hug.

561
00:28:56.985 --> 00:28:58.361
Congratulations.

562
00:28:58.445 --> 00:29:00.613
My brother from another mother.

563
00:29:00.697 --> 00:29:02.532
Proud mama.

564
00:29:03.116 --> 00:29:06.828
Something to drink?
We have moon juice. straight from L.A.

565
00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:09.038
-That sounds great.
-Perfect.

566
00:29:09.122 --> 00:29:10.415
-Nat?
-Gus.

567
00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:13.793
-Right.
-Do the honors. thanks.

568
00:29:14.294 --> 00:29:18.298
Hello everyone.
we are very excited to finally share

569
00:29:18.381 --> 00:29:20.675
our baby with you all.

570
00:29:21.384 --> 00:29:25.764
Polo. Blas and SignNow. Applause. please.

571
00:29:30.393 --> 00:29:32.437
-Go up.
-I'm fine. Dad.

572
00:29:33.062 --> 00:29:34.856
I'm good.

573
00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:38.777
-I don't like it.
-Don't make problems.

574
00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:41.279
Think about this.

575
00:29:41.362 --> 00:29:45.658
Human beings are the only
charitable species on this planet.

576
00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:50.622
That's why we should
entertain ourselves while we're at it.

577
00:29:50.705 --> 00:29:51.790
Don't you think?

578
00:29:52.665 --> 00:29:54.042
Yes!

579
00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:56.878
Help me inspire the world with SignNow.

580
00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:59.631
Signing for a better future. Thanks.

581
00:29:59.714 --> 00:30:00.590
Wow!

582
00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:05.804
That's it!

583
00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.358
We did it. man.

584
00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:34.457
Two million.

585
00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:37.293
I don't know.
I just don't feel comfortable.

586
00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:38.670
The money isn't ours.

587
00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:41.589
We found a need in society.
we're pioneers.

588
00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:43.550
We're not pioneers. we got lucky.

589
00:30:43.633 --> 00:30:45.635
This is just the start.

590
00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:47.971
-As CEO--
-Whoa.

591
00:30:48.805 --> 00:30:50.640
You auto-named yourself CEO?

592
00:30:50.723 --> 00:30:51.808
Shoes.

593
00:30:52.475 --> 00:30:53.309
Wow.

594
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.770
The DNA of a CEO

595
00:30:56.437 --> 00:30:59.649
-is charisma. leadership and empathy.
-Yeah.

596
00:30:59.732 --> 00:31:01.734
You can't be friends with a Jehova.

597
00:31:01.818 --> 00:31:03.736
SignNow? We've been waiting.

598
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.446
-Welcome to YouthBank.
-Thanks.

599
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:06.364
Hi. how are you?

600
00:31:08.116 --> 00:31:09.409
What's up?

601
00:31:11.578 --> 00:31:14.831
As you can see.
we're a bank specializing in startups.

602
00:31:14.914 --> 00:31:17.375
We don't have lines or stress.
like regular banks.

603
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:18.835
I feel good.

604
00:31:18.918 --> 00:31:21.129
Can I offer you ginger tea?

605
00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:23.089
Sure. Is it free?

606
00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:25.592
-It's complementary.
-Okay.

607
00:31:26.426 --> 00:31:29.512
Our services
are based on donations or "donnies."

608
00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:32.140
-That sounds like commission.
-Blas.

609
00:31:32.223 --> 00:31:33.766
No. it's the contrary.

610
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:35.602
It's a donnie.

611
00:31:36.144 --> 00:31:37.145
It's voluntary.

612
00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:38.396
Not exactly.

613
00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:40.899
Then it's a commission.

614
00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:41.900
It's a donnie.

615
00:31:41.983 --> 00:31:43.067
Donnie.

616
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:43.985
It's a donnie.

617
00:31:44.777 --> 00:31:45.778
It's…

618
00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:55.204
Very well.

619
00:31:56.289 --> 00:31:59.208
Blas. please sing
to set up your account password.

620
00:31:59.292 --> 00:32:00.209
-What?
-Sing.

621
00:32:00.293 --> 00:32:02.420
No. I'm not going to sing.

622
00:32:02.503 --> 00:32:05.131
Then you'll have to use
a boring numeric code.

623
00:32:05.214 --> 00:32:06.883
-Okay.
-Polo.

624
00:32:23.066 --> 00:32:23.900
Marvelous.

625
00:32:23.983 --> 00:32:24.859
I hate you.

626
00:32:25.526 --> 00:32:29.030
Welcome to the YouthBank family.
Use your funds responsibly.

627
00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:30.823
Thanks.

628
00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:35.870
-Can I have a tea to go?
-No.

629
00:32:35.954 --> 00:32:37.330
It's just for here.

630
00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:45.254
SignNow

631
00:32:46.589 --> 00:32:48.675
This will be standard in five years.

632
00:32:48.758 --> 00:32:51.135
Like this. blood flows to the brain.

633
00:32:53.012 --> 00:32:54.347
What are you doing?

634
00:32:55.098 --> 00:32:56.516
Having a morning beer.

635
00:32:56.599 --> 00:32:59.894
This isn't a beer garden.
You're setting a bad example.

636
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:01.938
Let me show you.

637
00:33:03.022 --> 00:33:05.650
These are the best programmers in Mexico.

638
00:33:05.733 --> 00:33:07.026
They weren't cheap.

639
00:33:07.568 --> 00:33:09.737
WIFI programmed "Call of Duty".

640
00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:14.951
TRX hacked Kanye West's twitter account
and wrote: "Fuck whoever reads this".

641
00:33:15.952 --> 00:33:18.538
Molécula has an awesome programmer look.

642
00:33:20.123 --> 00:33:21.374
Okay.

643
00:33:21.457 --> 00:33:23.459
What's that? What did we agree on?

644
00:33:23.543 --> 00:33:27.463
No more hallucinogenic gnocchi
or peyote smoothies.

645
00:33:27.547 --> 00:33:29.298
Are we in a jail?

646
00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:30.591
I love this place!

647
00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:33.511
Polo Ríos. I love this place!

648
00:33:33.594 --> 00:33:35.221
Aderales is joining us.

649
00:33:35.304 --> 00:33:36.139
Why?

650
00:33:38.266 --> 00:33:39.225
Gratitude.

651
00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:44.605
Hey Blas! How are you?

652
00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:46.190
-Good.
-Nice to see you.

653
00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:48.860
-Thanks for coming so quickly.
-I'm not that busy.

654
00:33:48.943 --> 00:33:51.529
There's been a hold-up at customs.

655
00:33:51.612 --> 00:33:53.031
I love this place. man.

656
00:33:53.114 --> 00:33:55.283
-He's head of quality control.
-Okay.

657
00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:58.870
Speaking of quality.
remember the stuff I gave you?

658
00:33:58.953 --> 00:34:01.956
Don't give it to anyone. it was off.

659
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.583
Like really off.

660
00:34:03.666 --> 00:34:06.794
Some guy ate his boss's face.
who knows what it was.

661
00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:08.463
You're just telling us?

662
00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:10.882
That's my line of work.

663
00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:15.053
My products don't come in a van.
it's a Russian roulette.

664
00:34:15.136 --> 00:34:17.805
Okay. come on! Team back!

665
00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.354
Your boss is speaking!

666
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:27.607
Come on!

667
00:34:28.357 --> 00:34:29.400
Laura. come.

668
00:34:31.527 --> 00:34:34.155
Hello. I'm Polo. CEO.

669
00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:35.782
Blas. CTO.

670
00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:39.744
I'm Aderales. Chief Experience Hacker.

671
00:34:40.536 --> 00:34:44.248
Welcome! This will be a big adventure.

672
00:34:44.332 --> 00:34:46.209
There's kombucha in the fridge.

673
00:34:46.292 --> 00:34:49.962
If you have any dietary restrictions.
let us know.

674
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:52.048
Let's kill it!

675
00:35:01.307 --> 00:35:02.308
Blas.

676
00:35:02.809 --> 00:35:04.393
What should we start with?

677
00:35:04.977 --> 00:35:06.020
Programming.

678
00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:09.148
Should we start
with a hybrid. native or progressive app?

679
00:35:11.651 --> 00:35:13.236
-All three.
-At the same time?

680
00:35:13.319 --> 00:35:18.032
Obviously.

681
00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:23.621
Who is this?

682
00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:25.540
SignNow's life coach.

683
00:35:26.165 --> 00:35:28.668
He's available
for whatever you need. 24/7.

684
00:35:32.922 --> 00:35:34.382
You suck.

685
00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:36.342
Learn how to play pool.

686
00:35:36.425 --> 00:35:38.136
What are you doing? It's late.

687
00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:41.806
I'm putting together
a tour of SignNow's office

688
00:35:41.889 --> 00:35:45.143
for the funders. It's so cool.

689
00:35:45.226 --> 00:35:47.562
-What are you doing?
-Living my life.

690
00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:49.856
You should try it sometime.

691
00:35:49.939 --> 00:35:52.024
I think I'm going to break my record.

692
00:35:52.108 --> 00:35:53.818
I have five Tinder dates.

693
00:35:53.901 --> 00:35:56.320
Wow. it's Monday. We're not done.

694
00:35:56.404 --> 00:35:58.739
It's slutty Monday.

695
00:36:00.616 --> 00:36:02.910
I could fire you for saying that.

696
00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:06.831
Good luck finding someone
that puts up with your neurosis.

697
00:36:06.914 --> 00:36:09.208
Please help me finish the logbook.

698
00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:12.003
That's not your job.
It's up to those two guys.

699
00:36:12.086 --> 00:36:13.254
No.

700
00:36:13.337 --> 00:36:17.341
Okay. yes. They're busy with other things.
I prefer to do it.

701
00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:20.386
That's your problem.
You micromanage everything.

702
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.849
-Come on.
-I haven't saved anything.

703
00:36:24.932 --> 00:36:27.351
-Let's go out.
-No.

704
00:36:27.435 --> 00:36:29.854
Your pussy needs some boom-boom.

705
00:36:29.937 --> 00:36:31.647
I'm dancing. My pussy.

706
00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:33.733
Just like this. pure sex.

707
00:36:33.816 --> 00:36:35.568
Come on. Mayte.

708
00:36:35.651 --> 00:36:37.445
You're lame.

709
00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:40.072
Keep it up and your pussy will close.

710
00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:41.782
No guy will want to hit it.

711
00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:44.118
-Dry. Forever.
-Okay.

712
00:36:58.591 --> 00:36:59.592
Hello?

713
00:36:59.675 --> 00:37:03.221
You spent $2.352.50 on paper.

714
00:37:03.304 --> 00:37:04.722
is that correct?

715
00:37:04.805 --> 00:37:07.058
Do you know the time? Don't you sleep?

716
00:37:07.141 --> 00:37:10.811
Sure. I sleep a little.
Like an hour or two.

717
00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:12.563
Geez. I'm sorry.

718
00:37:12.647 --> 00:37:13.940
I just woke you up.

719
00:37:14.023 --> 00:37:16.817
I didn't realize how late it was.

720
00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:18.194
Don't worry.

721
00:37:18.277 --> 00:37:19.862
Do you want to meet?

722
00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:22.323
-Really?
-Are you hungry?

723
00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:25.201
Actually. yes.
I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

724
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:31.207
Hello.

725
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:33.125
-Everything okay?
-Yes. all good.

726
00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:36.545
Wow.

727
00:37:36.629 --> 00:37:38.297
I really love this place.

728
00:37:38.381 --> 00:37:39.590
-Really?
-Yeah.

729
00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:44.553
This is the most authentic
Szechuan food in the city.

730
00:37:44.637 --> 00:37:46.555
I'm craving something greasy.

731
00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:48.557
-Whatever is the greasiest.
-Noodles?

732
00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:49.642
Yes. here.

733
00:37:49.725 --> 00:37:52.520
How did you discover this place?

734
00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:55.022
One day I woke up at two in the morning

735
00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:57.692
craving a dumpling.
I hadn't eaten in 36 hours.

736
00:37:57.775 --> 00:37:58.901
Why?

737
00:37:58.985 --> 00:38:01.821
Because I was fasting for too long.

738
00:38:01.904 --> 00:38:02.738
Why?

739
00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:05.199
Because. Sandra--

740
00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:07.243
It doesn't matter.

741
00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:09.578
-Okay.
-It was a huge mistake.

742
00:38:10.162 --> 00:38:11.664
I almost fainted.

743
00:38:11.747 --> 00:38:13.082
I get the idea.

744
00:38:13.165 --> 00:38:15.626
The point is
don't go so long without eating.

745
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:16.669
I totally agree.

746
00:38:19.338 --> 00:38:21.007
There we go. Ready.

747
00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:24.343
-Really?
-What?

748
00:38:24.427 --> 00:38:26.804
-It's 4:00 a.m.
-You know what they say.

749
00:38:26.887 --> 00:38:30.308
-Do what you love--
-And you'll never work a day in your life.

750
00:38:30.391 --> 00:38:31.809
-Exactly.
-I get it but--

751
00:38:32.768 --> 00:38:35.104
-Who is going to call you right now?
-Give it.

752
00:38:35.187 --> 00:38:37.106
Seriously. I need it.

753
00:38:37.189 --> 00:38:38.816
Put it here.

754
00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:41.277
-I found your weak spot.
-No.

755
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.280
What if someone urgently needs me?

756
00:38:44.363 --> 00:38:46.240
Gus is going to write you:

757
00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:49.785
"I had a wet dream about a logbook.

758
00:38:49.869 --> 00:38:51.704
Send it to me now."

759
00:38:53.372 --> 00:38:54.206
What?

760
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:55.791
-Don't move.
-What is it?

761
00:38:55.875 --> 00:38:56.917
You have…

762
00:38:58.836 --> 00:38:59.712
Don't do it.

763
00:39:00.629 --> 00:39:02.048
-Gross.
-It's alive.

764
00:39:02.131 --> 00:39:03.924
-Drop it.
-It's attacking me.

765
00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:06.677
-That's disgusting.
-It's attacking me.

766
00:39:10.222 --> 00:39:11.766
You improved Szechuan food.

767
00:39:12.433 --> 00:39:14.560
Okay. I'm leaving. Thanks.

768
00:39:15.269 --> 00:39:17.521
-No. Why?
-Thanks for everything.

769
00:39:17.605 --> 00:39:20.024
You're very stressed. Give me your hands.

770
00:39:20.107 --> 00:39:22.318
Trust me. I took a mindfulness class.

771
00:39:22.401 --> 00:39:23.944
Mindfulness? Gross.

772
00:39:25.613 --> 00:39:26.906
Fine.

773
00:39:26.989 --> 00:39:27.823
But it helps.

774
00:39:28.407 --> 00:39:29.533
Close your eyes.

775
00:39:30.117 --> 00:39:30.951
Inhale.

776
00:39:31.952 --> 00:39:33.204
Don't play tricks.

777
00:39:34.413 --> 00:39:36.248
This piece of metal

778
00:39:36.957 --> 00:39:38.042
doesn't control you.

779
00:39:39.085 --> 00:39:41.128
It has no power over you.

780
00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:42.296
I free you.

781
00:39:43.172 --> 00:39:44.173
Inhale.

782
00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:47.343
When you open your eyes.

783
00:39:47.843 --> 00:39:50.429
you will be completely relaxed.

784
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.058
Wow.

785
00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:56.727
I feel relaxed. it's incredible.

786
00:39:56.811 --> 00:39:57.812
Incredible.

787
00:39:58.854 --> 00:39:59.897
I told you.

788
00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.148
Rejuvenated.

789
00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:02.983
So. let's keep working.

790
00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:05.111
-No!
-Why not?

791
00:40:05.194 --> 00:40:07.696
I'm joking.

792
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.953
Sandyfit. really?

793
00:40:16.664 --> 00:40:20.251
Have you seen this?
She's the typical basic girl in neon.

794
00:40:20.334 --> 00:40:21.544
Who would wear that?

795
00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:24.922
Look at how she poses.

796
00:40:25.005 --> 00:40:27.675
Why would you do that? How embarrassing.

797
00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:29.135
You're stupid!

798
00:40:32.721 --> 00:40:34.181
You want to fuck him.

799
00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:37.309
-No. I don't.
-You want to fuck him.

800
00:40:37.393 --> 00:40:39.895
No. I don't. You're absolutely crazy.

801
00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:41.480
It makes total sense.

802
00:40:41.564 --> 00:40:45.276
He's a nerd that wants to save the world.

803
00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:46.902
Totally your fucking type.

804
00:40:46.986 --> 00:40:50.114
It's a conflict of interest.
he has a girlfriend and I don't like him.

805
00:40:50.197 --> 00:40:54.326
You've been working a lot.
You could use some

806
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:55.828
action down there.

807
00:40:55.911 --> 00:40:56.745
Mayte.

808
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:58.622
You need to fuck someone.

809
00:41:00.749 --> 00:41:01.917
Don't say fuck.

810
00:41:03.752 --> 00:41:06.714
Why do I have to
see her ass in every picture?

811
00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:07.715
And #Pad?

812
00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:09.133
-You like him.
-No.

813
00:41:09.216 --> 00:41:11.260
-Her ass bugs me.
-You like him.

814
00:41:13.262 --> 00:41:16.223
By chance. did you eat my cookies?

815
00:41:16.724 --> 00:41:17.933
Now you don't share?

816
00:41:19.226 --> 00:41:21.312
Here we believe sharing is caring.

817
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:24.523
We have a startup. It's time to grow up.

818
00:41:25.024 --> 00:41:26.734
They were shroom cookies.

819
00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:29.862
And a little LSD.

820
00:41:33.365 --> 00:41:36.076
Yesterday. they gave me a great trip.

821
00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.203
I ate two.

822
00:41:37.953 --> 00:41:40.080
I was starving. I was fasting.

823
00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:43.083
It says: "Blas's Chunky Funkies"

824
00:41:45.294 --> 00:41:48.422
How am I supposed to know
that means shrooms and LSD?

825
00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:51.217
I'm more productive on shrooms and acid.

826
00:41:51.842 --> 00:41:53.177
It's too late for that.

827
00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.095
The premium funders are coming.

828
00:42:03.938 --> 00:42:04.939
What?

829
00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:07.441
Holy shit. you're so crazy.

830
00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:10.402
Just love me.

831
00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:11.904
Sure.

832
00:42:11.987 --> 00:42:14.281
I'm the Chief Experience Hacker.

833
00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:17.284
I'm at your service today

834
00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:21.580
to make your visit
to SignNow more enjoyable.

835
00:42:21.664 --> 00:42:24.250
You're the CEO. man.

836
00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:27.086
And I leave you with the Boss.

837
00:42:33.842 --> 00:42:38.013
Welcome. you're here
because you are premium funders.

838
00:42:38.764 --> 00:42:41.517
This is SignNow. thanks for being here.

839
00:42:42.977 --> 00:42:45.104
Can we see what you're working on?

840
00:42:45.187 --> 00:42:47.523
Since we're already here.

841
00:42:48.607 --> 00:42:49.650
Yes. of course.

842
00:42:49.733 --> 00:42:52.861
There's not a lot to see
because we're 40%--

843
00:42:52.945 --> 00:42:56.323
-Actually. we have a beta version.
-Beta.

844
00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:57.616
That's great.

845
00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.243
Surprise.

846
00:42:59.326 --> 00:43:00.411
You know me.

847
00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.499
As you can see.

848
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.586
we chose futuristic looking graphics.

849
00:43:08.669 --> 00:43:13.090
Actually.
we went for a '90s Pop-Tarts design.

850
00:43:13.173 --> 00:43:16.343
Will the app support public breastfeeding?

851
00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:18.971
Does our breastfeeding offend you?

852
00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:22.516
Do our breasts make you uncomfortable?

853
00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:26.186
No. In fact. I was breastfed

854
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.521
and I have nipples.

855
00:43:28.314 --> 00:43:29.440
So. go ahead.

856
00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:31.358
How often will I be mentioned?

857
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:34.028
I'm one of the largest funders.

858
00:43:35.321 --> 00:43:36.447
Under the sea.

859
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:39.617
-Pardon?
-Unlimited.

860
00:43:40.826 --> 00:43:43.037
Unlimited mentions for premium funders.

861
00:43:43.537 --> 00:43:45.247
Yes!

862
00:43:46.165 --> 00:43:50.085
I have three NGOs: one anti-GMOs.
one for public breastfeeding

863
00:43:50.169 --> 00:43:53.297
and one pro LGBTQIA-plus.
I really love to help.

864
00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:56.675
-That's great.
-Wow.

865
00:43:56.759 --> 00:43:59.094
-I also like helping.
-I like it more.

866
00:43:59.178 --> 00:44:00.137
I like it more.

867
00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:03.223
In fact. I donate blood everyday.

868
00:44:06.518 --> 00:44:07.936
What are we made of?

869
00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.653
Stardust.

870
00:44:17.529 --> 00:44:18.864
Are you high?

871
00:44:22.451 --> 00:44:23.744
What have you done?

872
00:44:32.127 --> 00:44:33.128
Are you okay?

873
00:44:33.921 --> 00:44:35.005
What?

874
00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:44.848
You're a ray of light.

875
00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.442
Okay!

876
00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:57.486
Thank you everybody.

877
00:44:57.569 --> 00:44:58.696
Thanks for coming.

878
00:44:58.779 --> 00:44:59.613
Already?

879
00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:02.991
All good things must come to an end.
Come with me.

880
00:45:03.075 --> 00:45:03.951
Bye. Nat.

881
00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:07.371
The phones are a gift from SignNow.

882
00:45:07.454 --> 00:45:09.498
Now we can monitor you 24/7.

883
00:45:09.581 --> 00:45:11.667
to improve the app. obviously.

884
00:45:16.714 --> 00:45:20.259
I had to take the long way around.

885
00:45:20.342 --> 00:45:22.010
See you. Your tamer is here.

886
00:45:22.094 --> 00:45:24.555
-What's wrong? Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

887
00:45:24.638 --> 00:45:29.184
I was thinking.
are you both going to run SignNow?

888
00:45:29.268 --> 00:45:30.769
Yes. why?

889
00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:33.188
Shouldn't you be the face of the project?

890
00:45:33.272 --> 00:45:35.232
Like. the leader.

891
00:45:38.193 --> 00:45:39.027
Well.

892
00:45:40.362 --> 00:45:42.322
Blas doesn't take anything seriously.

893
00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:45.826
And I always have to do everything.

894
00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.538
I'll put it on 40. You're transparent.

895
00:45:49.621 --> 00:45:51.874
No. last time I burnt.

896
00:46:04.136 --> 00:46:06.430
No more straws. Signature accepted.

897
00:46:06.513 --> 00:46:07.347
Laura.

898
00:46:08.807 --> 00:46:09.767
Lau.

899
00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.310
It's been four hours.

900
00:46:11.393 --> 00:46:13.479
-Is that normal?
-I have no idea.

901
00:46:13.562 --> 00:46:14.772
But it's cool.

902
00:46:14.855 --> 00:46:17.107
Good morning. SignNow crew.

903
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:18.901
Hey partner. I love you.

904
00:46:18.984 --> 00:46:21.361
-You too.
-I love you.

905
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.448
What are you doing?

906
00:46:24.531 --> 00:46:26.492
This shouldn't be happening.

907
00:46:26.575 --> 00:46:29.787
It was supposed to be
a mediocre app that no one would use.

908
00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:32.414
Enjoy. partner.

909
00:46:33.165 --> 00:46:34.291
We're on top.

910
00:46:35.209 --> 00:46:37.336
It's a great day to be alive.

911
00:46:38.253 --> 00:46:39.213
Just in time.

912
00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:40.172
Come here.

913
00:46:40.923 --> 00:46:43.008
-What did you buy now?
-Come.

914
00:46:43.091 --> 00:46:44.510
Gentlemen. over here.

915
00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:46.386
You're acting like a child.

916
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:49.181
The Marzoco GS-3. special edition.

917
00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:52.100
It has volumetric programming.

918
00:46:52.726 --> 00:46:53.769
Third generation.

919
00:46:54.561 --> 00:46:56.980
-You're bribing me.
-We need coffee.

920
00:46:57.064 --> 00:47:01.819
If you put it that way. then okay.

921
00:47:01.902 --> 00:47:06.573
I also bought this special bean
that you're always talking about.

922
00:47:08.283 --> 00:47:10.786
No. man. No.

923
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:12.204
What?

924
00:47:12.287 --> 00:47:13.789
This isn't cool.

925
00:47:13.872 --> 00:47:16.542
Enjoy it. It's yours. you deserve it.

926
00:47:17.876 --> 00:47:18.752
Enjoy it.

927
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.130
Are you serious? Thanks so much.

928
00:47:22.214 --> 00:47:24.508
You have no idea what this means to me.

929
00:47:24.591 --> 00:47:27.052
I owe you one.

930
00:47:27.135 --> 00:47:28.053
Thank you.

931
00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:30.848
You have no idea what just happened.

932
00:47:30.931 --> 00:47:33.559
Have you seen the article in Harvard Biz?

933
00:47:33.642 --> 00:47:36.895
-No.
-Bankrolled is on fire. baby girl.

934
00:47:39.648 --> 00:47:42.442
I just spoke to a friend

935
00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:44.903
that works at YayTalks and guess what.

936
00:47:44.987 --> 00:47:47.447
-What?
-He's giving a spot to SignNow.

937
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:48.907
-Yay.
-Talks.

938
00:47:52.494 --> 00:47:54.413
-Very good.
-Yes.

939
00:47:55.122 --> 00:47:56.373
-Nat.
-What?

940
00:47:56.456 --> 00:47:58.625
You're our most valuable asset.

941
00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:00.627
Thanks a lot.

942
00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:04.339
-Make sure they're well prepared.
-100%.

943
00:48:04.423 --> 00:48:07.759
Are you really
rolling all your dice on these guys?

944
00:48:07.843 --> 00:48:10.679
-Obviously not.
-Have they given you the logbook?

945
00:48:10.804 --> 00:48:12.055
Yeah. No.

946
00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:15.893
I'm doing it for them.
to take it off their plate.

947
00:48:16.518 --> 00:48:18.270
Don't worry.

948
00:48:18.353 --> 00:48:22.357
Did you hear
I'm the company's most valuable asset?

949
00:48:23.025 --> 00:48:24.776
What nice handwriting.

950
00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:28.780
Karen.
you're the company's most valuable asset.

951
00:48:36.038 --> 00:48:36.872
I'm coming.

952
00:48:36.955 --> 00:48:40.167
Not yet. 50 calories more. Come on!

953
00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:55.599
I don't know what's wrong with my diet.
I get constipated at night.

954
00:48:55.682 --> 00:48:58.226
Add a prune to every snack.

955
00:48:58.852 --> 00:48:59.978
A prune.

956
00:49:00.562 --> 00:49:03.732
We have to reschedule these sessions.

957
00:49:04.316 --> 00:49:06.109
SignNow needs my attention.

958
00:49:06.193 --> 00:49:08.278
Your fecal matter is irregular.

959
00:49:08.362 --> 00:49:09.529
-I told you.
-Yes.

960
00:49:10.072 --> 00:49:12.491
I'm going to give you probiotics.

961
00:49:12.574 --> 00:49:13.450
Breathe in.

962
00:49:14.368 --> 00:49:15.786
I need Vitamin M.

963
00:49:15.869 --> 00:49:16.954
That doesn't exist.

964
00:49:17.037 --> 00:49:19.873
Motivation.
What do great entrepreneurs have?

965
00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:22.000
They have a muse.
I invented the app of the year.

966
00:49:22.084 --> 00:49:26.380
As your muse. I'm making sure
you look good and are successful.

967
00:49:27.339 --> 00:49:29.007
Extraction.

968
00:49:32.427 --> 00:49:35.305
You're going to want to defecate.
try to hold it.

969
00:49:35.889 --> 00:49:37.015
Yes. please.

970
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:45.691
Please don't poop
on the floor like last time.

971
00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:47.859
Juanito. can you get a mop please?

972
00:49:47.943 --> 00:49:48.986
I'm sorry.

973
00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:51.321
YOU'RE GIVING A YAYTALK!

974
00:49:52.864 --> 00:49:54.449
I'm giving a YayTalk.

975
00:49:55.951 --> 00:49:57.244
A YayTalk.

976
00:49:59.746 --> 00:50:02.040
Natalia arranged it.

977
00:50:02.749 --> 00:50:05.127
-What is that?
-No idea.

978
00:50:09.923 --> 00:50:12.467
We're back with Shark Investors.

979
00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:18.140
-You weren't at the office this afternoon.
-Sorry.

980
00:50:18.223 --> 00:50:21.059
I met these guys that are developing AI.

981
00:50:21.143 --> 00:50:24.354
They want to collaborate.
I'll tell you more tomorrow.

982
00:50:25.147 --> 00:50:28.817
Did they also have a colon cleansing?

983
00:50:35.407 --> 00:50:36.658
Good job. partner.

984
00:50:37.492 --> 00:50:38.493
I love you. man.

985
00:50:39.286 --> 00:50:40.245
We're going

986
00:50:41.663 --> 00:50:43.331
to give a YayTalk.

987
00:50:50.964 --> 00:50:52.340
Can you stop?

988
00:50:52.424 --> 00:50:54.426
I'm doing my kegel exercises.

989
00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:56.094
They keep my pussy young.

990
00:50:56.178 --> 00:50:58.889
You need a maternal figure in your life.

991
00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:02.684
-Nat.
-Yes.

992
00:51:02.768 --> 00:51:04.770
-Can you come to my office?
-Sure.

993
00:51:05.645 --> 00:51:07.814
-You're screwed.
-Shut up.

994
00:51:10.442 --> 00:51:11.485
Hello. guys.

995
00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:13.487
-The ball. please.
-Yes.

996
00:51:20.994 --> 00:51:22.662
-Center yourself.
-I am.

997
00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:26.750
Serge and Lebra found some inconsistencies
in Polo and Blas's resume

998
00:51:26.833 --> 00:51:28.877
and their experience is strange.

999
00:51:29.544 --> 00:51:32.380
-Dream catcher?
-Vine trimmer.

1000
00:51:32.464 --> 00:51:35.175
-What is a tiktoker?
-A modern influencer.

1001
00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:36.802
They don't have LinkedIn.

1002
00:51:36.885 --> 00:51:39.638
Polo's is under construction
and Blas doesn't use social media.

1003
00:51:39.721 --> 00:51:42.891
because he is 100% focused on our project.
#Creative.

1004
00:51:42.974 --> 00:51:45.435
-That's what pros do.
-That makes no sense.

1005
00:51:45.977 --> 00:51:47.062
Yes. it does.

1006
00:51:48.396 --> 00:51:50.023
-No?
-Look me in the eyes.

1007
00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:52.067
-I am.
-What are they saying?

1008
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.820
We can't…

1009
00:51:54.903 --> 00:51:56.446
handle…

1010
00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:57.531
another f…

1011
00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.660
-Another fiasco.
-Fiasco.

1012
00:52:01.743 --> 00:52:03.411
-Another fiasco.
-Of course not.

1013
00:52:03.495 --> 00:52:05.413
You looked into them. right?

1014
00:52:05.497 --> 00:52:08.750
Obviously. that's my job.
SignNow are pros.

1015
00:52:08.834 --> 00:52:10.752
And. you're in the best hands.

1016
00:52:10.836 --> 00:52:15.549
Which are my hands. so just relax. okay?

1017
00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:17.467
I'd never let you down.

1018
00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:19.886
Can I go now?

1019
00:52:21.304 --> 00:52:22.430
Okay.

1020
00:52:27.602 --> 00:52:29.980
Three. two. one…

1021
00:52:32.899 --> 00:52:35.110
Hello. This is Motivation Nation.

1022
00:52:35.193 --> 00:52:38.488
SignNow's podcast
about entrepreneurship and innovation.

1023
00:52:38.572 --> 00:52:42.325
I'm here with Carlos Solano.
a guru in child marketing.

1024
00:52:42.409 --> 00:52:44.828
-Hello Carlos. How are you?
-Good.

1025
00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:49.207
The magic of unboxing creates a connection
between a parent and child.

1026
00:52:49.291 --> 00:52:51.960
Through something
as beautiful as marketing.

1027
00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:56.047
-We're live.
-Guru?

1028
00:52:56.715 --> 00:52:58.967
Him? Where did you get this from?

1029
00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:01.219
We bought it. For our podcast.

1030
00:53:01.303 --> 00:53:03.346
-What podcast?
-Kill It Networks

1031
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:05.348
We're growing our audience.

1032
00:53:05.432 --> 00:53:06.766
It's a macro thing.

1033
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:11.062
We have a shitload of things to do.
we can't screw it up.

1034
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.565
You're right.

1035
00:53:13.648 --> 00:53:16.443
-We'll do it when I'm back.
-You're fucking with me.

1036
00:53:17.652 --> 00:53:20.530
It's invitation only
and I'm Cano's plus one.

1037
00:53:20.614 --> 00:53:21.489
Sure.

1038
00:53:21.573 --> 00:53:23.241
You're doing the Polini.

1039
00:53:23.825 --> 00:53:24.951
The what?

1040
00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:27.954
-The Polini.
-That sounds fun. I'm in.

1041
00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:30.415
When we were in university.

1042
00:53:30.498 --> 00:53:35.253
he always found a way to get out of things
and I ended up doing everything.

1043
00:53:35.337 --> 00:53:37.464
He obviously took all the credit.

1044
00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:41.259
All the moves I'm making
are for the project.

1045
00:53:44.638 --> 00:53:46.223
He's so immature.

1046
00:53:54.689 --> 00:53:57.651
So. it's an app like Tinder

1047
00:53:58.652 --> 00:53:59.611
but for dogs.

1048
00:53:59.694 --> 00:54:02.739
You can be a female or a male or a--

1049
00:54:03.448 --> 00:54:04.741
-Polo!
-Cano!

1050
00:54:04.824 --> 00:54:07.994
What's up. bro?
You're so thin. I can hug you now.

1051
00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:10.580
Sit down. Let me introduce you.

1052
00:54:10.664 --> 00:54:12.040
This is Lito. my guru.

1053
00:54:12.123 --> 00:54:14.626
He built me up. but first he tore me down.

1054
00:54:14.709 --> 00:54:16.127
Nice to meet you.

1055
00:54:16.211 --> 00:54:17.420
Posternak.

1056
00:54:17.504 --> 00:54:21.007
A saint. Twice a year he cleans the ocean.
It's not all mud.

1057
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:23.885
-No.
-I don't clean the oceans. they clean me.

1058
00:54:25.053 --> 00:54:26.263
And Pérez Conchas.

1059
00:54:27.222 --> 00:54:29.683
-He photographs women in thongs.
-I follow you.

1060
00:54:29.766 --> 00:54:31.101
I have two million followers.

1061
00:54:31.685 --> 00:54:32.852
And this is Polo.

1062
00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:35.021
He's developing a promising app.

1063
00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:37.899
I'm just doing my part.

1064
00:54:37.983 --> 00:54:40.026
I'm glad because I'm giving a YayTalk.

1065
00:54:41.861 --> 00:54:43.446
-A YayTalk?
-Yes.

1066
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:45.448
-Cool.
-That's incredible.

1067
00:54:52.038 --> 00:54:53.999
Patty. get me a YayTalk.

1068
00:54:59.713 --> 00:55:01.172
Hey!

1069
00:55:01.256 --> 00:55:03.675
Get up! How is the back end API going?

1070
00:55:03.758 --> 00:55:05.343
Is the JSON fixed?

1071
00:55:05.427 --> 00:55:06.594
Is the CDN ready?

1072
00:55:08.096 --> 00:55:08.972
No.

1073
00:55:11.057 --> 00:55:12.225
Why not?

1074
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:17.647
-We're working on what Polo asked.
-On his social networks.

1075
00:55:18.773 --> 00:55:20.358
I'm making his Wikipedia page.

1076
00:55:21.484 --> 00:55:23.486
-Polo has a Wikipedia page?
-Yes.

1077
00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:24.988
How cool. mother…

1078
00:55:26.698 --> 00:55:28.658
Leave that and work on the app.

1079
00:55:28.742 --> 00:55:29.951
Aderales.

1080
00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:32.662
Let's go.

1081
00:55:38.543 --> 00:55:41.796
-Ady!
-There you go.

1082
00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:45.050
Hello. everyone.

1083
00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:47.927
He's a bullshiter. don't believe him.

1084
00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:51.181
-And that's how you close the triangle--
-Polo!

1085
00:55:51.931 --> 00:55:53.308
-Partner.
-Let's go.

1086
00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:58.271
I'm not joking. Let's go.

1087
00:56:00.065 --> 00:56:01.900
Give me a second. He's moody.

1088
00:56:04.486 --> 00:56:06.071
You photographed my sister.

1089
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:14.329
I've wanted
to join this community for years.

1090
00:56:14.412 --> 00:56:15.663
I don't give a fuck.

1091
00:56:15.747 --> 00:56:18.708
You made the programmers
work on your motivational bullshit.

1092
00:56:19.626 --> 00:56:22.504
You put money into my brother's nonsense.

1093
00:56:22.587 --> 00:56:25.048
and you left the office to drink mimosas

1094
00:56:25.131 --> 00:56:28.843
with your club of posh ladies.
while I'm working my ass off.

1095
00:56:30.303 --> 00:56:32.680
I'm creating financial alliances.

1096
00:56:32.764 --> 00:56:34.766
No. you're fucking this up.

1097
00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:36.226
I can't do this alone.

1098
00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:39.979
Panoramic vision. partner.

1099
00:56:40.772 --> 00:56:41.773
Okay?

1100
00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:44.943
Aderales!

1101
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:49.114
He always does this to me. I'm his bitch.

1102
00:56:49.197 --> 00:56:52.283
Calm down. homie.

1103
00:56:52.367 --> 00:56:55.620
If it makes you so upset.
why are you doing it?

1104
00:56:55.703 --> 00:56:59.457
It's the principle. I finish what I start.

1105
00:56:59.541 --> 00:57:02.502
I get it but what good are your principles

1106
00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:05.422
if you're stressed.
look like shit and stink?

1107
00:57:05.505 --> 00:57:08.466
Because what makes you happy
doesn't make money.

1108
00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:09.968
That's a lie. man.

1109
00:57:10.051 --> 00:57:11.052
-No.
-Look at me.

1110
00:57:11.136 --> 00:57:13.638
I'm happy. I do what I want. I look great.

1111
00:57:14.889 --> 00:57:17.058
-Look who it is.
-Hey!

1112
00:57:17.142 --> 00:57:18.476
What's up?

1113
00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.480
-Where have you been? You brought gifts.
-In the North Pole.

1114
00:57:22.564 --> 00:57:25.150
Here you go. delicious dextro.

1115
00:57:25.233 --> 00:57:27.068
Enjoy it.

1116
00:57:27.152 --> 00:57:28.403
Why are you there?

1117
00:57:28.486 --> 00:57:30.989
-I was just thinking.
-Come here.

1118
00:57:31.072 --> 00:57:33.116
Meet my friend Blas.

1119
00:57:33.199 --> 00:57:36.786
This guy
is one of the creators of SignNow.

1120
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:39.038
AKA: A fucking genius.

1121
00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:42.208
Do you know each other?

1122
00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:43.126
-No.
-Yes.

1123
00:57:43.209 --> 00:57:44.961
-No?
-Yeah. no.

1124
00:57:45.545 --> 00:57:46.754
Yes. Thanks.

1125
00:57:46.838 --> 00:57:49.174
I wanted to work here but

1126
00:57:49.674 --> 00:57:51.843
it's easier to get into Harvard.

1127
00:57:56.931 --> 00:57:57.765
Babe.

1128
00:57:58.308 --> 00:58:00.727
I'm signing a petition
to normalize the fit body

1129
00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.395
and I have a thousand points.

1130
00:58:02.479 --> 00:58:03.354
I told you.

1131
00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.356
It's amazing.

1132
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:08.109
I never thought you'd do it. but…

1133
00:58:09.569 --> 00:58:10.445
Thanks.

1134
00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:12.864
You're my--

1135
00:58:16.201 --> 00:58:19.120
Fish protein. for my fatty.

1136
00:58:20.455 --> 00:58:21.331
Delicious.

1137
00:58:24.542 --> 00:58:26.377
This is on fire.

1138
00:58:26.461 --> 00:58:31.257
All of my friends
are obsessed with SignNow.

1139
00:58:32.133 --> 00:58:34.219
We're going to be millionaires.

1140
00:58:34.302 --> 00:58:36.387
And we're going to Tulum.

1141
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.765
What are you looking at?

1142
00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:39.849
FINAL RESULT

1143
00:58:41.059 --> 00:58:43.853
Fatty. let me explain.

1144
00:58:43.937 --> 00:58:47.232
It's not what you think.
I was going to tell you.

1145
00:58:47.982 --> 00:58:49.484
Is that what I am to you?

1146
00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:55.031
Your guinea pig? A blog entry?

1147
00:58:55.114 --> 00:58:56.699
An experiment?

1148
00:58:56.783 --> 00:59:00.203
No. I did it to make you feel better.

1149
00:59:00.286 --> 00:59:02.497
That's a sick way
to make someone feel better.

1150
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.166
I just wanted to help.

1151
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:08.294
You know I'm a blogger.
What else should I write about?

1152
00:59:10.964 --> 00:59:13.424
I didn't mean it like that.

1153
00:59:14.008 --> 00:59:16.678
I think I should go. this is…

1154
00:59:23.101 --> 00:59:24.227
What do you think?

1155
00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:27.188
Babe.

1156
00:59:27.272 --> 00:59:28.147
Polo!

1157
00:59:38.199 --> 00:59:42.161
Have a lot of patience
and you will see changes. I swear.

1158
00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:44.664
I love taking him to Zara

1159
00:59:44.747 --> 00:59:47.917
and buying him smaller clothes
so he can visualize it.

1160
00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:50.962
And. obviously. when you go to the beach

1161
00:59:51.045 --> 00:59:54.215
you can put a little bit of concealer
on his stretch marks.

1162
00:59:56.301 --> 01:00:00.471
Since you always say. I choose wrong

1163
01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.099
here are the pictures from the tour.

1164
01:00:03.182 --> 01:00:04.976
Pick the ones for Facebook.

1165
01:00:05.059 --> 01:00:06.477
Okay? Lots of love.

1166
01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:20.116
NOOTROPICS

1167
01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.317
-Natalia.
-I hope I'm not bothering you.

1168
01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.486
I was in the area and decided to stop by.

1169
01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:58.029
Okay.

1170
01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:01.532
Are you okay?

1171
01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:03.242
Yes.

1172
01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.995
We had a meeting with the partners.

1173
01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:07.872
What the fuck is this?

1174
01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:14.087
Our assistant
has a vitamins and supplements business.

1175
01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:16.506
Right. because selling drugs and--

1176
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:20.301
No. the government
is processing his licenses.

1177
01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:23.388
-Don't bullshit me.
-What are you talking about?

1178
01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:26.849
Don't fuck with me.
my job is very important to me.

1179
01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:28.017
I know that.

1180
01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:31.354
Calm down. Everything is fine.

1181
01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:32.480
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1182
01:01:32.563 --> 01:01:34.357
What are you hiding. asshole?

1183
01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.235
-Nothing. What would I hide?
-Just tell me.

1184
01:01:37.318 --> 01:01:38.277
Nothing.

1185
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.905
It's very strange to work with someone

1186
01:01:40.988 --> 01:01:45.034
and not having
a fucking idea who they are.

1187
01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.744
-Calm down.
-I'm calm.

1188
01:01:46.828 --> 01:01:48.079
-Look at me.
-I am.

1189
01:01:48.162 --> 01:01:49.038
It's me.

1190
01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:50.456
The same as before.

1191
01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.960
Unwavering. I don't hide things.

1192
01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:56.963
-Sorry.
-You're dumb.

1193
01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:58.923
You'll have your app.

1194
01:01:59.006 --> 01:02:00.299
-Okay.
-Trust me.

1195
01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:01.718
Everything is fine.

1196
01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:13.146
Wow. what you just did

1197
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.314
-is very inappropriate.
-What?

1198
01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:16.274
This.

1199
01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:19.235
There is a conflict of interest.

1200
01:02:19.318 --> 01:02:20.778
We work together.

1201
01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.781
-Wow. you're sick.
-But. you're--

1202
01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:25.658
-I'm what?
-Nothing.

1203
01:02:27.618 --> 01:02:28.578
You have a girlfriend.

1204
01:02:28.661 --> 01:02:31.205
-No.
-Yes. that busty fitness chick.

1205
01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:32.874
We broke up.

1206
01:02:41.048 --> 01:02:42.675
I can keep it on if you want.

1207
01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.385
Why would I want that?

1208
01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:45.928
-It's just--
-What?

1209
01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:48.181
-I have--
-What?

1210
01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.767
Okay.

1211
01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.895
You have a stretch mark. so what?

1212
01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:58.483
I don't care. Who would care about that?

1213
01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:16.292
-Really?
-What?

1214
01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:18.252
I need it.

1215
01:03:33.851 --> 01:03:35.311
SIGNNOW HAS NEW MESSAGES

1216
01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:58.626
Bill Gates.

1217
01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:04.507
Fuck.

1218
01:04:18.437 --> 01:04:21.732
We need a big hit. no matter how we do it.

1219
01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.861
Something that's a game

1220
01:04:24.944 --> 01:04:27.029
but helps in some way.

1221
01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:29.031
I'm part of the change.

1222
01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:31.075
-Exactly.
-I'm part of the change!

1223
01:04:31.158 --> 01:04:32.702
-Do you want…
-SignNow.

1224
01:04:33.494 --> 01:04:36.080
-That would be hilarious.
-We'll be rich.

1225
01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:37.665
It's not very moral.

1226
01:04:37.748 --> 01:04:40.001
Forget about that. it doesn't matter.

1227
01:04:40.084 --> 01:04:41.127
What the fuck.

1228
01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:50.887
-No way.
-Mayte.

1229
01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:54.682
-What's wrong with you?
-Everything is wrong.

1230
01:04:54.765 --> 01:04:57.310
Hello. You're interns? Can you leave?

1231
01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:59.520
This room is for people that work here.

1232
01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:01.606
Thanks. can you close the door?

1233
01:05:01.689 --> 01:05:04.150
Look. pepperoni. What's going on?

1234
01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:05.860
-You won't believe what I did.
-What?

1235
01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.070
What?

1236
01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:09.739
-What?
-I slept with Polo.

1237
01:05:09.822 --> 01:05:12.783
-Do I need to scream it?
-No way!

1238
01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:13.784
Be quiet.

1239
01:05:13.868 --> 01:05:16.746
-Vaginal? Anal?
-Don't be a pig. please.

1240
01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:20.082
I did it because you put ideas in my head.

1241
01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:21.667
-I understand.
-What?

1242
01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.753
You're frustrated. Micro-penis.

1243
01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:26.255
A curved penis?

1244
01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:28.215
You didn't cum?

1245
01:05:28.966 --> 01:05:31.469
-You didn't cum.
-I didn't. Is that bad?

1246
01:05:31.552 --> 01:05:32.887
Typical. Tell me.

1247
01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:35.097
-Are you eating shit?
-It's so good.

1248
01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:39.435
-You're not even listening.
-Don't leave me hanging. Tell me.

1249
01:05:39.518 --> 01:05:40.645
I can't believe it.

1250
01:05:40.728 --> 01:05:43.022
-Calm down.
-I feel like--

1251
01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:45.858
I know you don't do it
but fucking is normal.

1252
01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.360
-I've fucked…
-Calm down.

1253
01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:49.946
-…just not as much as you.
-What's wrong?

1254
01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:52.281
SignNow is a fiasco.

1255
01:05:52.365 --> 01:05:55.117
-What?
-It's a fiasco. There's a guy Aderales.

1256
01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:57.203
He's a drug dealer.

1257
01:05:57.286 --> 01:05:58.621
That's too funny.

1258
01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:01.040
They have no idea what they're doing.

1259
01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:03.668
No one does in this generation.

1260
01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:05.419
I saw the unedited video.

1261
01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:08.756
I think this is stupid.

1262
01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.008
Getting funded is easy money.

1263
01:06:11.884 --> 01:06:14.637
-They're screwed.
-They're not who they said they were.

1264
01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.139
-I brought them here.
-Look at me.

1265
01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:18.265
Calm down.

1266
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:19.725
What are you doing?

1267
01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.227
-What?
-#MeToo.

1268
01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:23.187
This is a glass office.

1269
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:25.272
Sorry. That's the vibe here.

1270
01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:27.483
I thought it would help you. Whatever.

1271
01:06:28.192 --> 01:06:29.026
Curved penis.

1272
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:33.698
SIGNNOW SUBSCRIBERS

1273
01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:40.579
-What is it?
-Your coffee.

1274
01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:41.956
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

1275
01:06:42.456 --> 01:06:45.334
This is Instagram's average use.

1276
01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:48.087
This is SignNow's average use.

1277
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.631
It has all the signs of user addiction.

1278
01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:53.134
It's good for releasing endorphins.

1279
01:06:53.217 --> 01:06:55.302
So good. We added a secret level

1280
01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:58.556
where you choose a weapon
and kill CEOs that pollute.

1281
01:06:58.639 --> 01:06:59.890
It's so funny.

1282
01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:03.227
No. that's not good. It's not funny.

1283
01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:05.521
Don't forget to turn on your notifications

1284
01:07:05.604 --> 01:07:07.940
and to use #KillingIt. Thanks life coach.

1285
01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.150
Where were you?

1286
01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:11.861
In your tanning bed. of course.

1287
01:07:11.944 --> 01:07:12.820
Look at this.

1288
01:07:13.654 --> 01:07:14.572
These numbers.

1289
01:07:15.656 --> 01:07:16.490
Is this true?

1290
01:07:17.074 --> 01:07:18.868
-Exactly.
-Way to go!

1291
01:07:18.951 --> 01:07:20.453
No. we created a monster.

1292
01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:23.122
-No. people are using it.
-Addictively.

1293
01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:25.332
I know what Jobs felt like with Macintosh.

1294
01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:28.044
Hold on. We're making people more idiotic.

1295
01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:30.463
-We should tell Bankrolled.
-What?

1296
01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:34.175
That the app they funded
is amazing and will be a hit? Go ahead.

1297
01:07:34.258 --> 01:07:37.595
We should stop before more people
liquefy their brains.

1298
01:07:37.678 --> 01:07:41.015
Let's say they're stupid enough
to cancel everything.

1299
01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:43.934
You won't get paid and you can't retire.

1300
01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:46.062
Excellent work team.

1301
01:07:48.105 --> 01:07:52.818
Do you think we could postpone
SignNow's talk until next year?

1302
01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:56.489
You already called
the international press.

1303
01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:59.575
No. that's great. Thanks. bye.

1304
01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:03.788
-Nat.
-Gus.

1305
01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:06.248
-Are you okay?
-Perfect. why?

1306
01:08:06.332 --> 01:08:09.293
SignNow is amazing. I can't stop.

1307
01:08:09.376 --> 01:08:11.545
Look. they're eradicating Ebola.

1308
01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:13.881
Bye. Ebola. Bye. poverty.

1309
01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:16.717
-I know.
-What?

1310
01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:19.929
I want to advance our marketing campaign.

1311
01:08:20.012 --> 01:08:22.389
I want everyone to know SignNow is ours.

1312
01:08:22.473 --> 01:08:25.643
That's a cool idea.
Don't you want to do it after YayTalk?

1313
01:08:25.726 --> 01:08:28.270
So that we can hold a focus group.

1314
01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:32.191
Do we want to postpone the best thing
that has happened in years?

1315
01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:34.735
No.

1316
01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:36.237
-No.
-Obviously not.

1317
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:37.863
-Do it. Perfect.
-Yes.

1318
01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:44.703
It's time to support and sign. Good job!

1319
01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.665
-Is everyone using the app?
-Yes.

1320
01:08:47.748 --> 01:08:49.583
I legalized abortion in the Vatican.

1321
01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:51.377
Good.

1322
01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.711
Team!

1323
01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:55.005
Guess what!
We're launching the huge campaign.

1324
01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:58.968
Bankrolled wants to
hype us up before the YayTalk.

1325
01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:00.094
You know what?

1326
01:09:00.177 --> 01:09:01.720
-Bonuses!
-What?

1327
01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:04.181
Performance bonuses for everyone!

1328
01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:05.266
-Come on!
-No.

1329
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:07.268
Why are you giving out money?

1330
01:09:07.351 --> 01:09:09.645
-Bonuses!
-Why today?

1331
01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:10.896
That's what they said.

1332
01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:14.775
Kombucha is now part of the daily diet.
You're welcome.

1333
01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:21.198
We spoke with Polo Ríos.
The mastermind behind SignNow.

1334
01:09:21.907 --> 01:09:26.162
A genius who shattered the idea
that social networks don't help humanity.

1335
01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:29.165
He gave us a few minutes of his time

1336
01:09:29.248 --> 01:09:30.916
to talk about how he is following

1337
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.544
the footsteps of Gandhi.
Mandela and Goethe.

1338
01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:38.174
Ríos and SignNow accelerated
all of the social justice battles

1339
01:09:38.257 --> 01:09:40.134
and they have gained our like.

1340
01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.267
They stole your spotlight. son.

1341
01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.935
How is Polo the mastermind?

1342
01:09:50.436 --> 01:09:54.899
The CEO doesn't see SignNow
as the most downloaded app of the year.

1343
01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:57.860
he considers it a gift to humanity.

1344
01:09:57.943 --> 01:09:59.236
The Polo Ríos foundation

1345
01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:01.113
has achieved--

1346
01:10:02.239 --> 01:10:05.701
Shouldn't you go practice
for your talk tomorrow?

1347
01:10:05.784 --> 01:10:06.911
You don't mind?

1348
01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:07.953
Not at all.

1349
01:10:08.579 --> 01:10:10.331
Awesome. partner. I love you.

1350
01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:13.250
Thanks. partner.

1351
01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:15.586
I love you.

1352
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:16.503
You too.

1353
01:10:25.512 --> 01:10:27.223
-This is not good.
-What?

1354
01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.104
I need you to do this.

1355
01:10:39.109 --> 01:10:40.986
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

1356
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.071
This is a bomb.

1357
01:10:42.154 --> 01:10:44.490
It's not easy. it will take all night.

1358
01:10:45.324 --> 01:10:47.660
I hear a lot of complaining
and not a lot of programming.

1359
01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:50.412
Relax. we'll take care of it.

1360
01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:52.164
Here you go.

1361
01:11:10.891 --> 01:11:12.810
Hello. I'm Polo Ríos.

1362
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.240
Hello. I'm Polo Ríos.

1363
01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:36.709
Hello. I'm Polo Ríos.

1364
01:11:38.043 --> 01:11:39.003
The best.

1365
01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:40.212
SIGNOW

1366
01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:41.338
Here's your coffee.

1367
01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:43.048
Thanks. How's it going?

1368
01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:48.762
How's it going?

1369
01:11:51.598 --> 01:11:52.599
How's it going?

1370
01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:55.311
We're done.

1371
01:11:56.687 --> 01:11:58.814
I love you a lot.

1372
01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:00.858
Aderales.

1373
01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:02.985
Let's go!

1374
01:12:05.946 --> 01:12:07.114
What? Another round?

1375
01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:09.116
Let's do it.

1376
01:12:11.785 --> 01:12:13.746
Send it to Jeff Bezos.

1377
01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:15.289
Tell the Governor of Durango

1378
01:12:15.372 --> 01:12:18.542
to fix himself up
for the meeting next week.

1379
01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:20.544
-Freddy Robles?
-Who's asking?

1380
01:12:21.253 --> 01:12:23.505
Polo Ríos. I'm an entrepreneur too.

1381
01:12:25.382 --> 01:12:26.550
The CEO of SignNow.

1382
01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:34.141
Its a petition signing platform that
combines a social network with a game.

1383
01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:37.102
That sounds app stupid.

1384
01:12:38.062 --> 01:12:40.189
Gigi. start getting me other things.

1385
01:12:40.272 --> 01:12:42.441
Now. anyone can give a YayTalk.

1386
01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:46.528
Yes. Mr. Slim.
Excuse me. I was talking to a fan.

1387
01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:48.906
I'm glad you liked it.

1388
01:12:49.406 --> 01:12:51.658
When are we going golfing?

1389
01:12:52.242 --> 01:12:53.327
What do you think?

1390
01:12:53.994 --> 01:12:55.954
Breathe. Everything is fine.

1391
01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:57.289
That doesn't help.

1392
01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.666
You're paranoid. What can go wrong?

1393
01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:00.584
Nothing.

1394
01:13:00.667 --> 01:13:03.837
The party. their conference.
Next project. it's done.

1395
01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:06.298
-Next. I won't see them again.
-Exactly.

1396
01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:07.508
Right?

1397
01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:09.218
-Mayte. no.
-Come on. Nat.

1398
01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:12.888
What?
Because I don't want to kiss my friend?

1399
01:13:24.983 --> 01:13:26.026
I'm Polo Ríos.

1400
01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:28.821
Entrepreneur and CEO of SignNow.

1401
01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:30.197
It's Polo Ríos.

1402
01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.659
For I long time.
I thought about how to build a bridge…

1403
01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:36.870
-Go change.
-I sell nootropics. not marijuana.

1404
01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:37.788
There.

1405
01:13:37.871 --> 01:13:39.373
… and a social cause.

1406
01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:43.627
Those seats are for
the Chief Experience Hacker. That's me.

1407
01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:47.673
How to change the world
with the power of one click?

1408
01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:48.882
One click.

1409
01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:51.176
A new way to confront problems.

1410
01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.929
People want to help.

1411
01:13:54.012 --> 01:13:56.890
But oftentimes. we don't know how.

1412
01:13:57.683 --> 01:13:59.309
That's what SignNow is about.

1413
01:13:59.393 --> 01:14:01.103
It's time to support and sign.

1414
01:14:01.186 --> 01:14:03.355
Super like. Good job.

1415
01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:05.774
I see some of you are using the app

1416
01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:07.484
which makes me happy.

1417
01:14:08.068 --> 01:14:10.112
But we'll do a short demo

1418
01:14:10.195 --> 01:14:12.990
for the people who don't use social media.

1419
01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:22.166
Sorry. we have a small glitch.

1420
01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:23.083
No.

1421
01:14:23.667 --> 01:14:25.127
There is no glitch.

1422
01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.004
Hello. excuse me.

1423
01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:30.382
Hello. I'm Blas.

1424
01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:32.926
From SignNow. Hello.

1425
01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:34.219
What's up?

1426
01:14:38.223 --> 01:14:39.183
What are you doing?

1427
01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:42.478
As you can see. SignNow has a new feature.

1428
01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:44.605
A new feature? What are--

1429
01:14:45.397 --> 01:14:48.775
Starting today.
we eliminated the visibility of likes

1430
01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:50.611
and no more public ranking.

1431
01:14:50.694 --> 01:14:53.238
-What?
-Only you will know what you signed.

1432
01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:54.156
What?

1433
01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:58.785
No. Of course there will be
likes. shares. swipes and super likes.

1434
01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:01.872
We all know that signing petitions

1435
01:15:01.955 --> 01:15:04.500
won't end the world's problems.

1436
01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:06.043
-That's mansplaining.
-Cool.

1437
01:15:06.126 --> 01:15:08.128
It's cool to be conscious.

1438
01:15:08.712 --> 01:15:11.548
But numbing ourselves
with so-called philanthropy.

1439
01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:15.636
games and social networks.
takes us further away from reality.

1440
01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:17.346
-What's happening?
-I don't know.

1441
01:15:17.429 --> 01:15:19.473
I'm not blaming anyone.

1442
01:15:19.556 --> 01:15:21.141
there's no one to blame.

1443
01:15:21.225 --> 01:15:22.893
But these apps

1444
01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:25.145
are truly harming us.

1445
01:15:26.104 --> 01:15:27.439
-Fix it.
-I'll fix it.

1446
01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:30.901
-Because it's about us…
-Each of you.

1447
01:15:30.984 --> 01:15:33.362
…we are compensated by hearts and likes

1448
01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.114
which makes us vulnerable to manipulation.

1449
01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:39.868
What do you mean there won't be likes?
It won't work.

1450
01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:41.453
We didn't donate to this.

1451
01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:43.622
I give blood and no one will know?

1452
01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:45.165
I thought we were helping.

1453
01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:46.875
This is obviously a mistake.

1454
01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:48.544
We will not be provoked.

1455
01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:51.630
This thing is dead. Let's go.

1456
01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:54.299
We'll figure this out and we'll be back.

1457
01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:58.095
SignNow is with you.
signing for a better future.

1458
01:15:58.178 --> 01:16:01.265
We'll figure this out.

1459
01:16:01.348 --> 01:16:04.184
I understand and I'll fix it. calm down.

1460
01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:06.853
Just give me a second and I'll fix it.

1461
01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:08.897
Nat. what is happening?

1462
01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:10.357
I don't know.

1463
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.526
What did you do to the app?

1464
01:16:12.609 --> 01:16:15.862
Send your complaints to @SignNow.app.

1465
01:16:15.946 --> 01:16:18.699
-Thanks. bye.
-Breastfeeding is a maternal right.

1466
01:16:18.782 --> 01:16:21.243
Don't touch my car. it's my grandfather's.

1467
01:16:21.326 --> 01:16:22.703
Don't touch my car!

1468
01:16:22.786 --> 01:16:25.330
-I'm unsubscribing.
-I don't care.

1469
01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:27.749
Go to hell! I'm going to kill you!

1470
01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:30.836
-You fucked it up.
-I didn't.

1471
01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:32.504
You fucked it up.

1472
01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:35.257
We're taking advantage of people…

1473
01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:37.884
-It's Polo. answer?
-No.

1474
01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:39.970
-What--
-Sorry.

1475
01:16:40.679 --> 01:16:42.222
Nat. I swear. It wasn't--

1476
01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:44.725
You ruined my life and my job!

1477
01:16:44.808 --> 01:16:48.020
You're a fucking insecure asshole!

1478
01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:49.396
You're shit in bed!

1479
01:16:54.192 --> 01:16:56.612
Stress doesn't control me.

1480
01:16:58.322 --> 01:17:01.366
-Stress doesn't control me.
-Breathe. Nat.

1481
01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:04.369
The solution to anxiety lives in the…

1482
01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:07.414
Anxiety doesn't control me.

1483
01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:09.416
I am peace. I am calm.

1484
01:17:09.499 --> 01:17:13.754
Meditation won't help
with anything right now!

1485
01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:17.716
Any comments on
the allegations against your company?

1486
01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:20.260
We're looking into the situation.

1487
01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:22.304
You admitted doing it while drunk?

1488
01:17:22.387 --> 01:17:25.682
This is a deepfake. Haven't you seen
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"?

1489
01:17:25.766 --> 01:17:27.476
Brad Pitt was an old baby.

1490
01:17:27.559 --> 01:17:29.436
Who'd want to do a deepfake?

1491
01:17:29.519 --> 01:17:32.189
Lots of people.
By the way. I sell nootropics.

1492
01:17:32.272 --> 01:17:34.858
If anyone is interested. scan this. Bye.

1493
01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:38.612
These so called entrepreneurs
made fun of their investors.

1494
01:17:38.695 --> 01:17:41.156
Spent money on lavish offices.

1495
01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.283
on a 24 hour life coach.

1496
01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:45.327
On colon cleanses?

1497
01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:47.663
Why? That's so fucking gross.

1498
01:17:48.413 --> 01:17:52.084
-Another strike for bankrolled.com.
-What did you do?

1499
01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:53.251
The right thing.

1500
01:17:56.129 --> 01:17:59.132
You have this moral superiority.
but it's not true.

1501
01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:01.218
People knew what they were getting into.

1502
01:18:01.301 --> 01:18:02.344
This has exploded.

1503
01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:05.972
-People will consume what you give them.
-You didn't have the right to do this.

1504
01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:10.477
SignNow! They're coming to lynch us.
Barricade!

1505
01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.020
Barricade!

1506
01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:15.065
You lied to the press.
you made that stupid video.

1507
01:18:15.148 --> 01:18:18.110
And you took credit
for the work I did alone.

1508
01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:21.405
-They're going to lynch you too.
-Followers are dropping.

1509
01:18:21.488 --> 01:18:23.615
That's what you care about?

1510
01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.909
You ruined me
in front of the other entrepreneurs.

1511
01:18:25.992 --> 01:18:29.955
You didn't deserve
respect from the other entrepreneurs.

1512
01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:32.999
I helped you because
you almost had a nervous breakdown.

1513
01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:35.502
This is because of your fear of success.

1514
01:18:35.585 --> 01:18:37.587
You call this success?

1515
01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:39.589
At what and whose expense?

1516
01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:42.551
To lie to ourselves and a ton of people.

1517
01:18:42.634 --> 01:18:43.844
Long live success!

1518
01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:47.431
-Family.
-What?

1519
01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:51.184
This is cyanide. they won't take us alive.

1520
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:54.521
You're a dead weight.

1521
01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:58.567
You'll always be this big.
without dreams or goals.

1522
01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:01.695
I'm sick of pulling you along.

1523
01:19:01.778 --> 01:19:03.822
I wanted to inspire you
because you're my friend.

1524
01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:06.491
You were in a bad place.

1525
01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:10.162
You'll never go anywhere.
you just complain and make-up excuses.

1526
01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:12.497
It's capitalism. the white man.

1527
01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:15.250
I gave you a real option to move ahead.

1528
01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:17.252
And you turned into a joke.

1529
01:19:21.339 --> 01:19:23.133
I didn't want us to be worthless.

1530
01:19:23.216 --> 01:19:25.927
You didn't care
if I liked what we were doing.

1531
01:19:26.636 --> 01:19:28.346
You don't care about my happiness.

1532
01:19:29.347 --> 01:19:31.433
You're so fucking selfish.

1533
01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:36.313
What about you? Go to hell.
Not now. life coach!

1534
01:19:38.231 --> 01:19:39.065
Fuck off.

1535
01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:43.820
Attention everyone.

1536
01:19:45.238 --> 01:19:48.116
This box represents disappointment.

1537
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.159
Defeat.

1538
01:19:49.826 --> 01:19:51.870
Nobody wants to be in this box.

1539
01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:52.871
Right?

1540
01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:58.668
Natalia. put all of your dreams
promises. goals and hopes in this box.

1541
01:20:02.255 --> 01:20:04.007
-You're fired.
-I got it.

1542
01:20:04.549 --> 01:20:06.927
You don't have to be so cruel. jerk.

1543
01:20:07.010 --> 01:20:08.637
What an asshole.

1544
01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:13.016
There's no need to be hurtful.
I'm hurt too. Natalia was my rising star.

1545
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:18.188
But what hurts more
is that we are all going to need a box.

1546
01:20:18.271 --> 01:20:20.857
because Bankrolled is bankrupt.

1547
01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:23.568
I won't be able to
pay your salaries today.

1548
01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:24.611
What?

1549
01:20:24.694 --> 01:20:26.279
Thanks. Natalia.

1550
01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:28.949
I just got an iPhone 13.
How will I pay for it?

1551
01:20:29.032 --> 01:20:31.243
I'll use an Android. gross.

1552
01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:35.539
I adopted a dog.
How will I explain that we're homeless?

1553
01:20:37.582 --> 01:20:40.585
Fuck you. you fucking asshole.

1554
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.170
-Fuck you.
-Let's go.

1555
01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:43.505
Those belong to the--

1556
01:21:15.745 --> 01:21:18.039
A meme. a chapter.

1557
01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:20.333
-A chapter for each meme.
-Cano.

1558
01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:23.712
How are you? I have a lot of new ideas.
Want to ping-pong?

1559
01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:26.548
You're not my plus one anymore.
Memelas is.

1560
01:21:26.631 --> 01:21:28.550
Forgive me.

1561
01:21:28.633 --> 01:21:30.719
Sir. come with me. please.

1562
01:21:30.802 --> 01:21:33.430
Before you say anything. listen to me.

1563
01:21:33.513 --> 01:21:36.850
The rock stars of today are influencers.

1564
01:21:36.933 --> 01:21:39.311
-Yes.
-Who is the most important influencer?

1565
01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:42.814
Memelas. So. I was thinking
of making a reality show

1566
01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:45.609
about Memelas
searching for the next Memelas.

1567
01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:48.028
-The next Memelas? I doubt it.
-I mean--

1568
01:21:48.111 --> 01:21:49.112
Action!

1569
01:21:49.195 --> 01:21:51.323
Hello. friends. How are you?

1570
01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:53.491
Not like that. Rocco.

1571
01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:54.910
Can I go to sleep?

1572
01:21:54.993 --> 01:21:58.246
-Think about the kids that watch you.
-It's 2:00 a.m.

1573
01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.540
He's a kid.
You're going to traumatize him.

1574
01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:02.709
Do I pay you
to tell me how to educate my son?

1575
01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:07.589
Okay. dear.
Let's see if you can do it. Action!

1576
01:22:07.672 --> 01:22:11.259
Hello. friends. How are you?
We're here with a new video.

1577
01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:14.346
We're trying out this really cool truck.

1578
01:22:19.142 --> 01:22:20.435
Motivation Nation?

1579
01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.272
Yes. How are you?

1580
01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:27.150
Give me back my money.

1581
01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:28.860
I'm sorry.

1582
01:22:30.195 --> 01:22:31.404
We invested everything.

1583
01:22:32.572 --> 01:22:34.741
Hey! Do you know this guy?

1584
01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:38.536
He's a thief. He made SignNow fail.

1585
01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.997
I wanted to stop global warming.

1586
01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:43.500
I signed for the manatee.
now it's too late.

1587
01:22:43.583 --> 01:22:47.754
Do you want the bees to go extinct?
No. no one does.

1588
01:22:47.837 --> 01:22:49.547
Hey. I'm talking to you.

1589
01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:52.550
Look me in the eyes when I'm speaking.

1590

BARISTA COMPETITION

1591
01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:57.931
Do you know him?
Kick him out or else I will.

1592
01:23:01.267 --> 01:23:02.102
I'm sorry.

1593
01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:04.270
I'll fix it.

1594
01:23:04.854 --> 01:23:05.939
I'm sorry everyone.

1595
01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:07.816
I'll fix it.

1596
01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:10.568
I'll fix it!

1597
01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:12.195
I promise I'll fix it!

1598
01:23:36.761 --> 01:23:37.929
When did I stop being myself?

1599
01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:40.974
When did I lose sight of my purpose?

1600
01:23:41.057 --> 01:23:43.476
When did I stop caring about others?

1601
01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:47.105
I'm like you. a slave to my insecurities.

1602
01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:48.815
I've never been enough.

1603
01:23:48.898 --> 01:23:51.860
It's never been enough
success. money. love.

1604
01:23:54.154 --> 01:23:55.196
Not thin enough.

1605
01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.745
I want to have the strength to grow.

1606
01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:04.789
Believing I've arrived at my goal.
takes me further away.

1607
01:24:05.373 --> 01:24:06.583
Only by being naked

1608
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.419
I can accept that I'm not perfect.

1609
01:24:09.502 --> 01:24:12.297
Like this. I can be happy with myself.

1610
01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:19.387
Today I begin loving my scars and bruises.

1611
01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:22.432
The success of others is not my failure.

1612
01:24:22.515 --> 01:24:25.435
I understand
there is no shortcut to success.

1613
01:24:25.518 --> 01:24:27.604
Life's paths aren't what I thought.

1614
01:24:33.193 --> 01:24:34.444
I have to apologize

1615
01:24:34.986 --> 01:24:37.864
for taking out my frustration
on the ones I love.

1616
01:24:37.947 --> 01:24:40.533
For hurting those
that would never hurt me.

1617
01:24:41.826 --> 01:24:43.953
What is success if it isn't shared?

1618
01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:47.040
Humility isn't thinking less of yourself.

1619
01:24:47.123 --> 01:24:48.458
just less about yourself.

1620
01:24:49.626 --> 01:24:53.046

BARISTA COMPETITION.
10TH EDITION

1630
01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:13.376
I didn't know amateurs competed.

1631
01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:15.753
I didn't know
they invited the bean-burner.

1632
01:26:16.462 --> 01:26:18.131
The machine was calibrated wrong.

1633
01:26:18.214 --> 01:26:19.591
Your nose as well?

1634
01:26:30.101 --> 01:26:33.146
I call this drink. "Blow my mind".

1635
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:35.106
This is an Iberian bean.

1636
01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:37.817
it has four times more caffeine

1637
01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:39.777
than an Arabic bean.

1638
01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:43.031
One cup can keep you awake for two days.

1639
01:26:43.114 --> 01:26:47.952
It has hints of jasmine.
lemon and strawberry jam.

1640
01:26:49.579 --> 01:26:50.997
From Soconusco. Chiapas.

1641
01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.959
it has
a controlled fermentation of 28 hours

1642
01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:57.337
and you have to calibrate it

1643
01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:02.717
at 18 grams per 36 milliliters
at 91 degrees.

1644
01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.844
It's very delicate.

1645
01:27:06.346 --> 01:27:07.889
Not everyone can do it.

1646
01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:50.723
You!

1647
01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:57.021
Thanks for the push.

1648
01:27:58.147 --> 01:28:00.024
No. man. You're made for this.

1649
01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:05.655
I should have supported you
and not pushed you into something else.

1650
01:28:05.738 --> 01:28:07.991
I ruined something that was going well.

1651
01:28:08.074 --> 01:28:09.450
It wasn't cool.

1652
01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:12.036
-I was going a little crazy.
-A little.

1653
01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:18.835
I missed your noodle soup smell.

1654
01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:20.795
You're my soulmate.

1655
01:28:20.878 --> 01:28:22.588
Catalan?

1656
01:28:23.589 --> 01:28:25.049
Third place!

1657
01:28:25.925 --> 01:28:26.926
Not first.

1658
01:28:50.283 --> 01:28:51.826
I want to be a part of that.

1659
01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:54.787
-Can you…
-Yes.

1660
01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:58.416
This channel is going to be a hit.

1661
01:28:58.499 --> 01:29:00.043
-Can you hold it?
-Sure.

1662
01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.299
Polo Ríos.

1663
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:16.809
Do you want to ping-pong?

1664
01:29:26.819 --> 01:29:28.279
It's your turn.

1665
01:29:30.323 --> 01:29:31.199
Thanks.

1666
01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:34.869
Natalia.

1667
01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:38.456
You work here?

1668
01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:40.666
-Obviously.
-I work here.

1669
01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:41.584
Yeah.

1670
01:29:43.127 --> 01:29:44.087
Come in. please.

1671
01:29:45.088 --> 01:29:45.963
Over here.

1672
01:29:48.257 --> 01:29:49.133
You look good.

1673
01:29:50.176 --> 01:29:51.177
More relaxed.

1674
01:29:51.844 --> 01:29:53.638
What did you do with the other Natalia?

1675
01:29:54.514 --> 01:29:57.392
The philosophy here is pretty cool.

1676
01:29:57.475 --> 01:29:59.811
it helps me remember

1677
01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:02.355
that I don't have to control everything.

1678
01:30:02.939 --> 01:30:04.023
You found balance.

1679
01:30:06.109 --> 01:30:06.984
That's cool.

1680
01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:13.616
Over here. please.

1681
01:30:16.994 --> 01:30:18.496
How can we help you?

1682
01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:20.164
I'm here to make a deposit.

1683
01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:24.043
Clearing your name?

1684
01:30:24.127 --> 01:30:26.379
Something like that. It wasn't our money.

1685
01:30:27.505 --> 01:30:28.548
I saw your video.

1686
01:30:30.007 --> 01:30:31.384
How embarrassing.

1687
01:30:31.467 --> 01:30:34.011
No. I liked it.

1688
01:30:36.472 --> 01:30:38.224
What's next for Polo Ríos?

1689
01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:40.768
Try to figure out who I am.

1690
01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:43.020
What I want.

1691
01:30:43.646 --> 01:30:44.522
To apologize.

1692
01:30:45.898 --> 01:30:47.525
And. I don't know.

1693
01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:50.069
Lay low for awhile.

1694
01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:54.866
That will be easy
with a million hits on Google.

1695
01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:56.826
You Googled me?

1696
01:30:58.244 --> 01:30:59.454
I Googled you too.

1697
01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:03.916
I need your voice password. please.

1698
01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:06.461
Please.

1699
01:31:20.683 --> 01:31:21.559
Really?

1700
01:31:21.642 --> 01:31:22.477
Okay.

1701
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:23.686
We got it.

1702
01:31:38.034 --> 01:31:38.951
Wow.

1703
01:31:39.035 --> 01:31:41.954
The best barista in town.

1704
01:31:42.038 --> 01:31:44.832
People heard about "Blow my mind".

1705
01:31:44.957 --> 01:31:47.043
You found a need.

1706
01:31:47.668 --> 01:31:49.337
-What's that?
-What?

1707
01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:51.172
-That.
-It's nothing.

1708
01:31:51.255 --> 01:31:53.299
-You got a tattoo. man.
-Yeah.

1709
01:31:53.382 --> 01:31:54.926
It's my personal brand.

1710
01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:56.928
-So lame. I know.
-No!

1711
01:31:57.512 --> 01:31:58.471
I love it.

1712
01:31:58.554 --> 01:32:00.264
A drip from Ethiopia.

1713
01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:01.182
Thanks.

1714
01:32:02.642 --> 01:32:03.559
Polo?

1715
01:32:03.643 --> 01:32:05.186
No way. I'm Janono.

1716
01:32:05.269 --> 01:32:07.188
The CEO of Dogflix. I wrote you.

1717
01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:11.484
Remember Dogflix?
It's like Netflix but for dogs.

1718
01:32:11.567 --> 01:32:15.279
Audiovisual content just for dogs.
Everything.

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:17.240
Series. comedies. dramas.

1720
01:32:17.323 --> 01:32:20.618
Narcodramas. reality shows. talk shows.
Everything.

1721
01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:22.328
Your dog will never be bored.

1722
01:32:22.411 --> 01:32:24.455
We're going to be millionaires.

1723
01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:26.541
What's your number? I'll call you.

1724
01:32:26.624 --> 01:32:29.418
Send me a DM on Instagram.
I check it daily.

1725
01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:30.670
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1726
01:32:30.753 --> 01:32:32.129
-Let's do this.
-Yes.

1727
01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:34.799
That's it. Millionaires. man.

1728
01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:36.592
Thanks. Dogflix.

1729
01:32:37.593 --> 01:32:38.427
Good luck!

1730
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.930
I have distributors there.

1731
01:32:41.013 --> 01:32:42.723
All right. bye.

1732
01:32:42.807 --> 01:32:43.641
Love you.

1733
01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:45.935
Tell him about the universities.

1734
01:32:46.435 --> 01:32:47.937
Oh yeah.

1735
01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.940
They cleared the jam.
I'm getting a lot of product.

1736
01:32:51.023 --> 01:32:52.483
Adderall. Ritalin. everything.

1737
01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:56.237
The universities are giving it
to the kids for exams.

1738
01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:59.282
I converted all my money to Aders.

1739
01:32:59.365 --> 01:33:02.076
I'm about to invest
in a small homes Mexican startup.

1740
01:33:02.159 --> 01:33:03.578
What's going on?

1741
01:33:03.661 --> 01:33:06.163
Don't get scared but the Aders collapsed.

1742
01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:07.999
It's really hurting.

1743
01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:09.917
It's at 20 cents.

1744
01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:12.420
I bought it at 20.000 pesos.
You said it would go up.

1745
01:33:12.503 --> 01:33:14.880
I said it would fluctuate.
It's fluctuating.

1746
01:33:14.964 --> 01:33:17.925
-That's the world of cryptocurrency.
-What?

1747
01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:19.010
Calm down.

1748
01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:22.597
I swear that
if you weren't the world's sexiest man--

1749
01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.015
Hey!

1750
01:33:24.098 --> 01:33:26.517
-Control yourself.
-Thanks.

1751
01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:29.186
No. man. That's not cool.

1752
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:30.980
Blas. what's going on?

1753
01:33:31.063 --> 01:33:34.233
Genetimex. with a blood sample we'll tell
you if you're a descendant of Moctezuma.

1754
01:33:34.317 --> 01:33:35.443
No way.

1755
01:33:36.235 --> 01:33:38.654
-That's not bad.
-No.

1756
01:33:38.738 --> 01:33:43.618
Hold on. that's not bad.

1757
01:33:44.869 --> 01:33:46.495
Call Tony.
