about music.

I recorded four songs
with the guys.

And we started giving these
songs in a CD to friends

don't give it to anyone

"Obsesión."

536
00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.190
"¿Cuándo Volverás?"

537
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:17.230
It's not that I'm trying
to recreate that.

538
00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:22.039
But I want to feel that feeling
that I felt when I created that.

539
00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:25.019
And I get that
most of the time.

540
00:34:25.039 --> 00:34:26.230
This is a record.

541
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:27.019
Man: Oh. yeah.

542
00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:35.070
Sergio George: You see Romeo
bringing in a person like Usher

543
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:38.179
on a bachata track
and bilingual.

544
00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:41.059
And you got both sides who don't
even speak each other's language

545
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:43.010
understanding and
they're feeling it.

546
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.010
It has to be real.

547
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.170
So. that's what's happening now
with this new movement

548
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:53.000
of the Spanish-speaking
Bad Bunny. Ozuna. Romeo

549
00:34:53.019 --> 00:34:55.000
who are singing in Spanish.

550
00:34:55.019 --> 00:34:56.199
And maybe they have a few
words here and there in English.

551
00:34:56.219 --> 00:34:59.079
But that's where the market was
naturally going to go

552
00:34:59.099 --> 00:35:00.070
because the Hispanic culture
has exploded

553
00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:02.190
all over the world now.

Mero: Having traveled
across the country

557
00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.159
in search of the soul
of bachata...

558
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.119
...I finally got the chance
to see Romeo live.

559
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:39.139
The fact that it's called.
"La gira del pueblo"

560
00:35:39.159 --> 00:35:42.010
and it's free
is super fitting. bro.

561
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.170
because like. everybody's
just regular people. man.

So. personally. to me.

564
00:35:51.099 --> 00:35:54.079
this is literally
a dream come true. literally.

565
00:35:54.099 --> 00:35:55.059
because I grew up
listening to this guy.

566
00:35:55.079 --> 00:36:00.010
making that connection
from my youth.

567
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.050
So. you know. growing up

568
00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.199
and listening to it
in the background.

569
00:36:02.219 --> 00:36:05.090
singing along in my little
beat-up Honda Civic.

570
00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:09.190
This is incredible. man.

so much sense to do this

584
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:14.159
with this album.

[music]

...Utopia is a fire concept.

588
00:37:21.079 --> 00:37:25.179
How did you come up
with that idea of doing duets

589
00:37:25.199 --> 00:37:27.230
with like...

590
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.150
Romeo: This was a project
that I had in mind

591
00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:32.190
for maybe seven. eight years.

592
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:37.010
I wanted to do a concept album
where I do one song

593
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:40.159
with each and every one of these
pioneers of bachata.

594
00:37:42.139 --> 00:37:46.210
This is my gift to DR
for so much they've given me.

[music]

596
00:37:49.219 --> 00:37:54.199
The plan. to be honest with you.
was to only tour in DR.

597
00:37:54.219 --> 00:37:57.159
But that was it. that was all
I thought I was gonna do.

598
00:37:57.179 --> 00:38:00.019
[music]

599
00:38:00.039 --> 00:38:01.079
But the album came out

600
00:38:01.099 --> 00:38:05.000
and something interesting
happened.

601
00:38:05.019 --> 00:38:06.090
People were getting the concept.

602
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.079
Mero: Yeah.
It resonated with people.

603
00:38:07.099 --> 00:38:08.079
Romeo: Yeah.

604
00:38:08.099 --> 00:38:10.199
And I just had this crazy...

605
00:38:10.219 --> 00:38:12.110
I was perceiving like.
"This is special.

606
00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.019
This is going beyond DR."

607
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:16.179
I had a conversation.

608
00:38:16.199 --> 00:38:19.119
I'm like. "I need
to do something big.

609
00:38:19.139 --> 00:38:22.210
something that was
like a statement."

610
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:26.190
And. you know.
someone mentioned MetLife.

611
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:31.119
Marc Anthony: T woke up
one day and was like.

612
00:38:31.139 --> 00:38:35.210
"Yo. what's the
biggest venue like?

613
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:37.050
And let's do it."

614
00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.090
Romeo: At first. I was like.
"Okay. we could do that."

615
00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:41.210
And then I just asked.
"What's the capacity?"

616
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:46.030
When they said. "87.000."
I bitched out a little.

617
00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:47.170
I was like. "Wait. wait. wait."

618
00:38:51.219 --> 00:38:53.210
Marc Anthony: You know. I heard
about this MetLife thing.

619
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:57.019
In the beginning.
I was like. [gasping].

620
00:38:57.039 --> 00:38:57.190
It just took my breath away.

621
00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:59.199
I was like. "What you doing?"

622
00:38:59.219 --> 00:39:02.010
Like. I'm like.
"You've got balls. bro."

623
00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:06.219
But if anybody could
pull it off. it's T.

624
00:39:08.159 --> 00:39:10.210
There are a lot
of people talking shit.

625
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.219
He does it.

626
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:12.219
That's the difference.

627
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:17.050
Joaquín Díaz: No Latin artist
had filled the MetLife

628
00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.219
by him or herself.

629
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.099
Usually. artists will go
in a group

630
00:39:22.119 --> 00:39:24.099
of two or three or four artists.

631
00:39:24.119 --> 00:39:26.139
And then. you know.
they will sell tickets.

632
00:39:26.159 --> 00:39:29.019
But Romeo by himself.
all by himself.

633
00:39:30.019 --> 00:39:30.199
Marc Anthony:
Of course there's pressure

634
00:39:30.219 --> 00:39:32.139
in putting yourself
in that position

635
00:39:32.159 --> 00:39:34.030
because it can go wrong.

636
00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:35.039
Right?

637
00:39:35.059 --> 00:39:38.190
And it will hurt you
more than the good it does

638
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:41.000
when you put yourself
in those big situations.

639
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.119
Group: Amen.

640
00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:45.110
Marc Anthony: How many talks
do you think he had?

641
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:46.099
How many people
were like. "Naw. um. oh.

642
00:39:46.119 --> 00:39:49.070
"I don't know.
Eh. ah. oh. oh man.

643
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:49.190
"Oh. yeah. the budget.

644
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.110
Oh. I don't know."

645
00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:51.110
He had to plow through that.

646
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:55.130
do it. kick ass.
sell it out and he goes. "Next."

647
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:56.119
You have to be that guy.

648
00:39:56.139 --> 00:39:58.150
And that's who he is.

649
00:39:59.179 --> 00:40:00.119
Joaquín Díaz: He was able
to fill the place up.

650
00:40:00.139 --> 00:40:04.110
That's groundbreaking
for bachata.

651
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:05.230
It's come a long way.

652
00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.230
Romeo is taking it
to the next level.

653
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.110
He broke the boundaries
of bachata not being accepted

654
00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.170
to bachata being respected.

not Romeo.

00:56:45.119 --> 00:56:48.110
Romeo. he has that persona
and that's worked for him.

901
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:51.099
But Anthony Santos
the real person...

902
00:56:52.099 --> 00:56:54.199
this guy could be a comedian.

903

If he was not to be
a musician anymore.

904
00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:57.199

913
00:57:33.139 --> 00:57:36.070
But when it comes
to his business. it's all off.

914
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:40.039

Gerry Grimaud Jr.: I remember
one year. he's in Spain.

916
00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:43.119

Let me tell you
something.

967
01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.059
You see how he is?

968
01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:06.150
That come to show you.
he's on top of it.

and you're mixing it in--

972
01:00:14.219 --> 01:00:16.000
Mate Traxx: I haven't slept.

973
01:00:16.019 --> 01:00:18.170
I've been up since yesterday.
but you hear this. right?

974
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:19.179
That's what he is.

975
01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:22.130
Romeo: And the cop.
the Chichi. the reference.

976
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:23.119
I need that.

977
01:00:23.139 --> 01:00:25.139
Mate Traxx: I was about
to go home and sleep

978
01:00:25.159 --> 01:00:26.190
because I'm dead tired.

979
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:27.170
No. he wants
to keep on working.

980
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.130

with waterfalls.
with lights with you know...

It was amazing for anybody
that attended the concert.

1003
01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:18.179
But leading right up to it.

1004
01:02:18.199 --> 01:02:21.179
and this is something
nobody knows.

1005
01:02:21.199 --> 01:02:24.219
we get there
the night before for rehearsals.

1006
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.190
We still have 30% to complete.

1007
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:30.039
There's wires hanging.

1008
01:02:30.059 --> 01:02:31.159
And Romeo is going
to kill me for saying this.

1009
01:02:31.179 --> 01:02:32.179
You know. he's going crazy.

1010
01:02:32.199 --> 01:02:34.190
Nobody ever seen him
going crazy and upset that.

1011
01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:35.190
"What's going on?

1012
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:38.159
"Normally when I get to
a stage for rehearsal.

1013
01:02:38.179 --> 01:02:39.199
"it's 100% done.

1014

1018

Super perfectionist.

1019
01:02:53.099 --> 01:02:55.039
Artie Pabon: And it has
to be perfection.

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:02.070

01:03:03.099 --> 01:03:04.230

things that you'd be like.

this makes sense."

Everything.

1026

Artie Pabon: And he wants
to know a small detail.

1027
01:03:10.179 --> 01:03:12.159
"What color are the curtains?"

1028
01:03:12.179 --> 01:03:15.000
And. you tell him the color.

[music]

1030
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:19.130
Sergio George: Talent is only
a small part of it.

1031
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:20.110
You have to care.

1032
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:24.010
A lot of artists
who don't last don't care.

1033
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:24.219
They just care about putting
the money in their pocket

1034
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.079
and buying watches
and Rolex and a car.

1035
01:03:28.099 --> 01:03:29.199
And they don't care about
that person

1036
01:03:29.219 --> 01:03:31.099
who has to sweat every day

1037
01:03:31.119 --> 01:03:34.210
and has to go to a job
to work to have money

1038
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:36.159
to afford to go see you.

1039
01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:37.119
You got to care
about that person.

1040
01:03:37.139 --> 01:03:39.079
They don't have
to buy your concert.

1041
01:03:39.099 --> 01:03:40.110
They don't have to
do anything.

1042
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:42.010
They can just take their money
and go somewhere else.

1043
01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:44.000
So. show that person respect.

1044
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:47.079
They have jobs.
they have worries.

1045
01:03:47.099 --> 01:03:48.079
they have problems.

1046
01:03:48.099 --> 01:03:49.230
They don't have
to go to your show.

1047
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:53.130
I got to care about the public.

1048
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:56.130
I got to care by putting
my right show together.

settled downtown.

Here Uptown in the Bronx though.

1224

their own bodegas

01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:48.229
similar to the colmados
from back home

1226

where people not only shop
for necessities

1227
01:16:49.210 --> 01:16:52.170
but gather socially
as a community.

1228

1248

with the exception of Utopia.

1249
01:18:49.159 --> 01:18:53.229
And the reason why I feel that
Utopia is the perfect project

1250
01:18:54.010 --> 01:18:58.079
is because there's
more of them than myself.

1251
01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:04.079
I was able to go into
different styles within bachata.

1252
01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:05.100
And it was very organic.

1253

to each of their albums.

something that...

1256
01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:14.170

from back in the day

1259
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:20.109
because he shows them
a lot of respect

1260
01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:22.159

he doesn't have to do.

1261
01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:26.039
Or he can just go by himself and
people are going to go anyway.

1262
01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:30.010
It's paying homage to all
these legends from before.

1263
01:19:30.029 --> 01:19:32.170
it's a testament
to him as a person.

1264
01:19:32.189 --> 01:19:36.079
that his responsibility
is to leave that legacy

1265
01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:38.210
for future generations
for them to not only say.

1266
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:40.159
"Hey. look at me.
but look at the guys

1267
01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:41.159
that came before me.

1268

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:47.210
