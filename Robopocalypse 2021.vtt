00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.769
Punching in two grades right.

4
00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:28.236
Two grades right.

5
00:01:28.302 --> 00:01:32.040
Letting go in 10. 9. 8...

6
00:01:33.375 --> 00:01:34.977
Ready to make
history. gentlemen.

7
00:01:41.716 --> 00:01:43.885
Nfx is in position.

8
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.157
<i>Affirmative. Nfx is in position.</i>

9
00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:50.927
<i>Initiate excavation.</i>

10
00:01:50.992 --> 00:01:52.861
Initiating excavation.

11
00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.934
How we doing. Wilson?

12
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:00.903
Never better. Thanks for asking.

13
00:02:02.103 --> 00:02:05.073
<i>Careful. Careful. Dr. Marietta.</i>

14
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.144
Tenth time's
the charm. Dr. Lopez.

15
00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.382
The medusa ai is not
fully uploaded to the nfx.

16
00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.552
Still programming
field commands manually.

17
00:02:16.617 --> 00:02:17.954
It takes time. gentlemen.

18
00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:24.192
Really? Guys?

19
00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:26.394
Guys. what's going on?

20
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.002
Dr. Lopez?

21
00:02:34.502 --> 00:02:35.670
Wilson?

22
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:38.840
Damn it. guys.
What happened this time?

23
00:02:47.817 --> 00:02:48.584
Wilson!

24
00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:50.886
Can you hear me?

25
00:02:50.953 --> 00:02:53.354
<i>Loud and clear.
I had a total shutdown inside.</i>

26
00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:56.091
<i>I believe the shutdown was
triggered by Dr. Lopez.</i>

27
00:02:56.157 --> 00:02:58.426
<i>but I can't reach him
to confirm.</i>

28
00:02:58.493 --> 00:02:59.961
Well. I'm not gonna
stay in here!

29
00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:01.429
<i>Just hang tight.</i>

30
00:03:01.497 --> 00:03:02.932
<i>Let me get over
to the mainframe.</i>

31
00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:08.402
<i>Is medusa acting up again or...</i>

32
00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.840
Dr. Marietta? Dr. Marietta?

33
00:03:13.442 --> 00:03:14.644
Great.

34
00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.055
Agh!

35
00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.692
Abel. what happened?

36
00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:33.094
I don't know.

37
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:34.906
One minute. I'm initiating
the platform response.

38
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.467
And the next. medusa
starts seizing my computer

39
00:03:37.532 --> 00:03:39.234
and creating
a directive profile separate

40
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.002
from operating the robot.

41
00:03:41.068 --> 00:03:44.072
Medusa should be following me.
but instead... it's driving.

42
00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.308
<i>System update received.
Nfx is rebooting.</i>

43
00:03:47.376 --> 00:03:48.843
Guys. what's going on?

44
00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.913
All right. Did you take
the nfx robot offline

45
00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:52.881
to make sure it
doesn't malfunction?

46
00:03:52.948 --> 00:03:55.818
I just did. but medusa seems
to be one step ahead of me.

47
00:03:55.883 --> 00:03:58.619
- Are you reading this?<i>
- Copy Wilson. we read you.</i>

48
00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:00.223
Let's look at the code.

49
00:04:05.228 --> 00:04:07.028
<i>Switching to automatic systems.</i>

50
00:04:07.096 --> 00:04:08.664
I'm losing some
serious control here!

51
00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.066
<i>Wilson. are you doing that?</i>

52
00:04:10.132 --> 00:04:12.367
Wait... that's...
That's new code.

53
00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:13.935
I see that.

54
00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:16.439
<i>You need to implement
a stop-gap firewall now!</i>

55
00:04:16.504 --> 00:04:17.772
Yes! Implementing now!

56
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:20.408
Well. somebody
hacked our system.

57
00:04:20.475 --> 00:04:22.511
No. I checked.
Firewalls are tight.

58
00:04:22.577 --> 00:04:24.645
She's coming up
with her own code.

59
00:04:24.713 --> 00:04:26.582
That's impossible!

60
00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:27.850
This looks like a data dump.

61
00:04:27.915 --> 00:04:29.317
<i>No. that's not possible either.</i>

62
00:04:29.384 --> 00:04:31.887
No. we can't
be reading this correctly.

63
00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:33.865
Guys. there are a thousand
ways this could go sideways.

64
00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.591
<i>The variables are immense.</i>

65
00:04:35.656 --> 00:04:38.859
But when it's too complicated.
the best answer is the simplest.

66
00:04:38.927 --> 00:04:40.996
It's not writing its own code.

67
00:04:41.062 --> 00:04:44.500
It can't. at least
not at this level.

68
00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:46.400
The ai doesn't have the...

69
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:52.873
We need to shut medusa down now.

70
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.876
It's already ahead of me.

71
00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:57.313
I've calculated that
it's writing three million lines

72
00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:58.947
of code every eight seconds.

73
00:04:59.014 --> 00:05:02.451
That is exponentially increasing
by 42% every five minutes.

74
00:05:02.516 --> 00:05:04.452
At that rate...

75
00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:06.254
It's already run
the calculations

76
00:05:06.321 --> 00:05:08.424
you referenced into.

77
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.091
Doctors. I can see it from here.

78
00:05:10.158 --> 00:05:11.826
It's counting down
from three hours.

79
00:05:11.892 --> 00:05:13.728
It's setting its own
benchmark for firewalls!

80
00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:15.865
Those are all
smart-system firewalls.

81
00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:21.235
Now it's working on
the military drone system.

82
00:05:21.302 --> 00:05:24.572
Look. Its next
benchmark are the Ares robots

83
00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.074
they just launched.

84
00:05:29.845 --> 00:05:31.814
Ares robots
were never a good idea.

85
00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.483
And all smart missiles.
global military networks!

86
00:05:34.548 --> 00:05:37.351
It's outlining a strategy to
take control of them one by one!

87
00:05:37.418 --> 00:05:40.421
It's not programmed to take
over the world's military.

88
00:05:40.488 --> 00:05:41.656
Now it can!

89
00:05:41.723 --> 00:05:43.358
If medusa updated
its programming

90
00:05:43.425 --> 00:05:45.961
to take over global militaries
without human programming.

91
00:05:46.028 --> 00:05:50.099
without our programming.
that means...

92
00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:53.468
It's become sentient. hmm?

93
00:05:53.535 --> 00:05:55.237
That is impossible!

94
00:05:55.303 --> 00:05:58.372
If it was. it would
carry out its own directive

95
00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.475
to its logical conclusion.

96
00:06:00.543 --> 00:06:02.745
It would use the military to...

97
00:06:02.812 --> 00:06:04.213
It would wipe out
all life on earth!

98
00:06:05.348 --> 00:06:07.182
Everything goes offline now!

99
00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:11.153
Ow! Damn it!

100
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.989
- You okay?
- I'm fine. fine.

101
00:06:14.622 --> 00:06:15.790
Guys?

102
00:06:16.658 --> 00:06:18.527
Dr. Lopez?

103
00:06:18.593 --> 00:06:20.396
Marietta?

104
00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.164
Marietta!

105
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.432
It's got the local network!
We don't have much time!

106
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.235
Look... look!

107
00:06:30.305 --> 00:06:32.074
Medusa has identified
us as a target.

108
00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:33.776
- Why?
- We gotta go.

109
00:06:33.841 --> 00:06:35.481
It's already breached
the military drones!

110
00:06:36.944 --> 00:06:38.947
Get outta here! Go!

111
00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:41.783
- Guys?
- <i>Update complete.</i>

112
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.286
Guys. go for Wilson! Guys?

113
00:06:44.353 --> 00:06:47.223
<i>Returning to spaceport
in t-minus five minutes.</i>

114
00:06:47.288 --> 00:06:49.625
<i>All personnel must
vacate the premises.</i>

115
00:06:49.692 --> 00:06:50.793
<i>Lose all tech!</i>

116
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.494
<i>Anything it can use to ping us!</i>

117
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.430
<i>Phones. tablets. ear pods.
anything with a chip!</i>

118
00:06:59.401 --> 00:07:01.903
Dr. Lopez! Marietta!

119
00:07:04.072 --> 00:07:06.373
Okay. I'm abandoning zone 39.

120
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.442
I'm heading back to camp!

121
00:07:18.254 --> 00:07:19.254
Okay. I'm out.

122
00:07:19.321 --> 00:07:21.857
Doctors. can you hear me?

123
00:07:21.923 --> 00:07:23.892
Guys? Damn it!

124
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:29.764
Years ago I created a device
that could override

125
00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:31.132
the bunker's mag-locks.

126
00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:33.735
Hopefully. it's still
hidden here.

127
00:07:33.802 --> 00:07:35.069
Found it!

128
00:07:35.137 --> 00:07:36.805
I just need to enter
the right code.

129
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.550
It's not shutting it down.

130
00:07:39.574 --> 00:07:41.242
Let me try.

131
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.978
Once we get inside. we need to
contact NSA. dod. all of them!

132
00:07:44.045 --> 00:07:46.882
Abel. I'm trying to focus!

133
00:07:46.947 --> 00:07:49.483
Wait. Let me try this.

134
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.851
All right. listen.

135
00:07:50.918 --> 00:07:52.295
Once we get inside.
maybe we can use

136
00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:53.719
the bunker's computers
to hack in...

137
00:07:55.858 --> 00:07:57.026
I got it!

138
00:07:57.091 --> 00:07:58.894
- <i>Drones are inbound!</i>
- Crap!

139
00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:00.362
I'm on my way.

140
00:08:00.428 --> 00:08:01.996
Wait!

141
00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:09.069
Abel!

142
00:08:09.137 --> 00:08:10.506
No!

143
00:08:39.368 --> 00:08:41.003
One...

144
00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:53.149
Agh!

145
00:08:55.216 --> 00:08:57.785
You okay? I got the signal.

146
00:08:57.852 --> 00:09:00.221
I told you to stay underground.

147
00:09:00.288 --> 00:09:01.856
Let's go.

148
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.360
You're shaking.

149
00:09:08.697 --> 00:09:11.332
Did they malfunction

150
00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:13.668
and medusa targeted
Lopez and marietta?

151
00:09:13.735 --> 00:09:16.504
A robot that holds a grudge?

152
00:09:16.572 --> 00:09:17.940
What did they do to it?

153
00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:23.412
I don't know.
I'm probably a target.

154
00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:26.348
You're not a target

155
00:09:26.414 --> 00:09:30.351
unless someone
programmed you as a target.

156
00:09:30.418 --> 00:09:33.254
Maybe it thinks I know
how to work the nfx robot.

157
00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:35.191
- But you don't know.
- I know I don't know!

158
00:09:36.725 --> 00:09:38.293
You know who does?

159
00:09:42.364 --> 00:09:45.500
You broke up over a year ago.

160
00:09:45.567 --> 00:09:47.001
She can't still be upset.

161
00:09:47.969 --> 00:09:49.471
Her dad just died... I...

162
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.076
It's better if it comes
from someone she knows.

163
00:09:57.446 --> 00:09:58.514
Yeah.

164
00:09:58.581 --> 00:10:01.216
She's a bad-ass.
She can handle this.

165
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.884
Okay. you are in invisible mode
and inside the firewall.

166
00:10:36.951 --> 00:10:40.187

a wonderful holiday
meal instead.

182
00:11:29.804 --> 00:11:31.372
And remember. "at silicorp.

183
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.677
you're not just a
binary number. you're family."

184
00:11:36.043 --> 00:11:38.112
Wow. that was touching.
gray scout.

185
00:11:55.663 --> 00:11:58.567
<i>Okay. everyone log out of
there. and cover your ip trail</i>

186
00:11:58.634 --> 00:12:01.169
<i>before silicorp realizes
that it's been hacked.</i>

187
00:12:10.111 --> 00:12:12.246
That must be a new record. Tara.

188
00:12:12.312 --> 00:12:14.949
<i>Whatever. She had a head start.</i>

189
00:12:15.015 --> 00:12:16.317
<i>I got stuff to do.</i>

190
00:12:17.485 --> 00:12:19.520
Wow.

191
00:12:19.586 --> 00:12:24.058
Still a sore loser just
like he was in high school.

192
00:12:24.125 --> 00:12:26.193
You want me to send him
some malware?

193
00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:28.663
Malware? Jorge. no.

194
00:12:31.866 --> 00:12:33.735
Come on. no!

195
00:12:33.802 --> 00:12:35.870
Hey. remember what I told you.

196
00:12:35.937 --> 00:12:39.073
A good hacker doesn't go after
every dog that barks. okay?

197
00:12:41.043 --> 00:12:43.010
As much as I like
to see him squirm.

198
00:12:43.077 --> 00:12:44.379
he'll be back again tomorrow.

199
00:12:44.446 --> 00:12:46.382
He can't resist us.

200
00:12:47.514 --> 00:12:48.850
You.

201
00:12:48.917 --> 00:12:55.357
He can't resist you. you mean.

202
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.129
Couldn't keep off the board.
could you. cube?

203
00:13:01.196 --> 00:13:03.731
Tara? You there? Tara?

204
00:13:03.798 --> 00:13:05.134
<i>Is that Wilson?</i>

205
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.543
<i>He knows he should
be calling you by</i>

206
00:13:06.567 --> 00:13:08.302
<i>your hacker name. gray scout.</i>

207
00:13:08.369 --> 00:13:10.971
Do you have a private line
where I could talk to you?

208
00:13:11.038 --> 00:13:12.408
It's about your father.

209
00:13:15.576 --> 00:13:16.778
My dad?

210
00:13:16.845 --> 00:13:18.546
<i>Why don't you just call
me on the...</i>

211
00:13:18.613 --> 00:13:21.149
We were testing our
nfx rescue robotic unit today

212
00:13:21.216 --> 00:13:24.919
and. uh...
There was an accident.

213
00:13:24.985 --> 00:13:27.054
<i>He...</i>

214
00:13:27.121 --> 00:13:31.492
He... there was a drone.

215
00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:33.460
<i>A drone?</i>

216
00:13:33.528 --> 00:13:36.798
<i>It came from nowhere.
a military drone.</i>

217
00:13:36.864 --> 00:13:41.903
Dr. Marietta got into
the bunker. but your father...

218
00:13:41.969 --> 00:13:43.338
He didn't make it.

219
00:13:46.207 --> 00:13:47.775
<i>I don't understand.</i>

220
00:13:47.842 --> 00:13:50.110
<i>Wh... why would a drone...</i>

221
00:13:50.177 --> 00:13:51.712
I don't know.

222
00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:53.514
I don't know if
this was sabotage.

223
00:13:53.581 --> 00:13:55.493
I don't know if somebody
hacked into the mainframe.

224
00:13:55.517 --> 00:13:58.820
but he was definitely targeted.

225
00:13:58.886 --> 00:14:02.323
Probably marietta as well.
probably me.

226
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:04.259
<i>Wilson. I...</i>

227
00:14:06.193 --> 00:14:07.895
Tara? Tara!

228
00:14:07.962 --> 00:14:10.399
Hey. come in!

229
00:14:10.466 --> 00:14:11.533
Tara?

230
00:14:20.107 --> 00:14:21.442
Tara?

231
00:14:30.118 --> 00:14:32.421
Tara?

232
00:14:32.486 --> 00:14:33.788
Tara. what are you doing?

233
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:37.191
You can't do that!

234
00:14:37.258 --> 00:14:38.460
Don't touch me!

235
00:14:41.363 --> 00:14:43.432
What even is this?

236
00:14:48.568 --> 00:14:50.337
I've never seen this before.

237
00:14:50.404 --> 00:14:52.038
Is that a cryptomix?

238
00:14:52.105 --> 00:14:53.509
No.

239
00:14:53.575 --> 00:14:56.411
It's a qbit language
my dad taught me.

240
00:14:56.476 --> 00:14:58.121
He said if anything
suspicious ever happens.

241
00:14:58.145 --> 00:15:01.482
enter that language here on
this computer to protect myself.

242
00:15:01.548 --> 00:15:04.584
You think you're in trouble?

243
00:15:04.652 --> 00:15:07.322
Not as in trouble as the
assholes who killed my father.

244
00:15:08.756 --> 00:15:10.524
What are you doing?

245
00:15:10.591 --> 00:15:12.494
I just sent a bullet
to take out 3.6%

246
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:14.729
of the nation's drone
coding program.

247
00:15:14.796 --> 00:15:15.997
What?

248
00:15:16.063 --> 00:15:17.932
At least they can't
keep killing people.

249
00:15:17.999 --> 00:15:19.534
Tara. don't!

250
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:25.240
You happy now?

251
00:15:25.307 --> 00:15:27.875
You think that's gonna
solve everything?

252
00:15:27.942 --> 00:15:29.543
Get out!

253
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.713
You probably just signaled
4.000 NSA mainframe computers

254
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.481
to this location!

255
00:15:34.548 --> 00:15:37.384
So maybe you shouldn't be
here when the FBI arrives!

256
00:15:37.451 --> 00:15:40.621
My DNA is all over this shit!

257
00:15:40.688 --> 00:15:42.557
This is what they live for!

258
00:15:42.624 --> 00:15:46.195
There's probably some jacked up
computer targeting us right now!

259
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:02.778
Oh. no. no. no!
Tara. what did you do?

260
00:16:03.912 --> 00:16:06.514
Wilson. she hacked the Pentagon.

261
00:16:08.082 --> 00:16:09.317
She's screwed.

262
00:16:10.317 --> 00:16:11.752
I think we're all screwed.

263
00:16:13.922 --> 00:16:14.923
What's happening?

264
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.490
Bastards.

265
00:16:16.557 --> 00:16:20.561
I used qbit code and they
echoed it right back at me.

266
00:16:20.628 --> 00:16:22.497
Great. So what do you think?

267
00:16:22.563 --> 00:16:23.963
50 years in prison
for shutting down

268
00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:25.933
our nation's
military drone program?

269
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.803
100 years? 200?

270
00:16:31.706 --> 00:16:34.342
They just killed
half our system!

271
00:16:36.344 --> 00:16:37.679
What is this?

272
00:16:37.745 --> 00:16:41.883
Oh. my god.
photos from my smart phones.

273
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.455
Why?

274
00:16:48.056 --> 00:16:49.725
I'm gonna try
to reverse the ping.

275
00:16:50.926 --> 00:16:52.259
Get an ip on it!

276
00:16:52.326 --> 00:16:54.095
Sending over to you now.

277
00:16:54.162 --> 00:16:55.430
Check it out.

278
00:16:57.633 --> 00:16:58.767
Oh. shit.

279
00:16:58.833 --> 00:16:59.900
What?

280
00:16:59.967 --> 00:17:01.101
You're not gonna like it.

281
00:17:01.168 --> 00:17:02.403
What?

282
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.940
Spaceport. where your dad
works... worked.

283
00:17:06.007 --> 00:17:07.942
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:08.009 --> 00:17:10.578
That's where medusa is?

285
00:17:10.645 --> 00:17:12.445
Damn!

286
00:17:12.512 --> 00:17:14.281
What's medusa?

287
00:17:14.348 --> 00:17:18.919
Jorge. we have a lot bigger
problems than going to prison.

288
00:17:18.986 --> 00:17:20.988
It's the quantum ai
my dad was working on.

289
00:17:21.055 --> 00:17:23.625
It can find anyone.

290
00:17:23.692 --> 00:17:25.926
We need to hit
the kill switches now!

291
00:17:25.992 --> 00:17:27.561
And grab our go bags!

292
00:17:30.198 --> 00:17:31.132
What?

293
00:17:31.199 --> 00:17:32.834
The drones.

294
00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:33.969
- Here?
- No.

295
00:17:36.104 --> 00:17:37.838
Gray scout.

296
00:17:37.905 --> 00:17:39.840
Tara!

297
00:17:39.907 --> 00:17:41.442
Gray scout. come in!

298
00:17:41.509 --> 00:17:43.510
<i>We're a little busy right now.</i>

299
00:17:43.577 --> 00:17:45.779
There's no time!
You have to get outta there now!

300
00:17:45.846 --> 00:17:47.448
<i>What? Why?</i>

301
00:17:47.515 --> 00:17:49.217
We tracked three
tier three military drones

302
00:17:49.284 --> 00:17:50.552
- to your location!
- <i>What? How?</i>

303
00:17:50.617 --> 00:17:51.885
<i>How. what do we...</i>

304
00:17:51.952 --> 00:17:53.254
I don't know! I don't know!

305
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.722
It senses heat!

306
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:57.224
Are you near a power plant?
Go hide in there!

307
00:17:57.291 --> 00:17:58.925
Destroy everything.

308
00:17:58.992 --> 00:18:00.628
Hibachi style!

309
00:18:00.695 --> 00:18:02.973
Tara. Jorge. can you hear me?
You need to get outta there now!

310
00:18:02.997 --> 00:18:04.199
What about us?

311
00:18:04.265 --> 00:18:05.734
Get everything ready.

312
00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:07.536
If we have to leave.
we'll do it quickly.

313
00:18:09.269 --> 00:18:10.439
Run!

314
00:19:28.682 --> 00:19:30.852
Drones! Help us!

315
00:19:30.919 --> 00:19:31.986
Robot apocalypse!

316
00:19:32.053 --> 00:19:34.756
Active shooter!
Everybody out back!

317
00:19:36.089 --> 00:19:37.891
Jorge! Listen. it's dangerous!

318
00:19:37.959 --> 00:19:39.360
You don't have to do this!

319
00:19:39.426 --> 00:19:40.571
If you want. you can
just go out!

320
00:19:40.595 --> 00:19:41.997
Tara. we're in this together.

321
00:19:45.333 --> 00:19:46.535
Fine.

322
00:19:50.771 --> 00:19:52.173
We're trapped.

323
00:19:55.442 --> 00:19:57.112
I have an idea.

324
00:19:58.746 --> 00:20:00.715
- Hibachi.
- Hibachi.

325
00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:06.788
Hey! You gonna pay for all that?

326
00:20:21.502 --> 00:20:23.672
Hurry up. Tara! Light the fuse!

327
00:20:49.463 --> 00:20:50.598
Whoa.

328
00:20:52.098 --> 00:20:54.535
You ever seen one
of these before?

329
00:20:54.603 --> 00:20:56.738
Never been this close
to one before.

330
00:20:56.804 --> 00:21:00.675
It's an entire drone brain.
It's got a whole control panel.

331
00:21:03.211 --> 00:21:05.947
Hey. that thing
just tried to kill us.

332
00:21:06.013 --> 00:21:07.781
But I think it's dead.

333
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.985
We should take it.

334
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.755
Come on.

335
00:21:18.692 --> 00:21:20.060
It's okay.

336
00:21:21.962 --> 00:21:23.632
Oh...

337
00:21:25.733 --> 00:21:26.967
You know what to do with it?

338
00:21:32.273 --> 00:21:33.307
Yeah.

339
00:21:35.609 --> 00:21:36.744
Yeah. I do.

340
00:21:39.212 --> 00:21:40.615
Let's go.

341
00:21:40.681 --> 00:21:42.851
Hurry! I can hear more drones!

342
00:22:09.443 --> 00:22:11.579
Wait. They turned around?

343
00:22:20.221 --> 00:22:21.955
Wilson...

344
00:22:22.022 --> 00:22:23.625
<i>We didn't make it to
the power plant.</i>

345
00:22:23.691 --> 00:22:25.460
<i>The drones immediately found us.</i>

346
00:22:25.527 --> 00:22:27.126
Are the drones
still chasing you?

347
00:22:27.193 --> 00:22:29.663
<i>No. their targeting systems
must be overwhelmed.</i>

348
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.098
<i>I think we lost them.</i>

349
00:22:31.164 --> 00:22:33.166
Good. The grid is freaking
out over here.

350
00:22:33.233 --> 00:22:34.968
<i>Plus. I don't know
if you've seen the news.</i>

351
00:22:35.035 --> 00:22:36.713
<i>But there are rolling
blackouts in New York.</i>

352
00:22:36.737 --> 00:22:39.541
Chicago. San Francisco
and Alabama.

353
00:22:39.606 --> 00:22:42.143
They just had a blackout
in London.

354
00:22:42.209 --> 00:22:44.512
<i>Wilson. listen.</i>

355
00:22:44.578 --> 00:22:47.080
Just before Jorge and
I escaped from the drones.

356
00:22:47.147 --> 00:22:49.416
we received a d.M. From
the NSA server

357
00:22:49.483 --> 00:22:51.284
directed to me by name.

358
00:22:51.352 --> 00:22:53.988
putting me at the top
of the terror watch list.

359
00:22:54.055 --> 00:22:56.324
<i>It seized my computer.</i>

360
00:22:56.391 --> 00:22:59.026
then put out a pin for
the entire dod to track.

361
00:22:59.093 --> 00:23:02.129
Yeah. I saw that when I was
controlling the nfx robot.

362
00:23:02.195 --> 00:23:03.964
Look. virgin code
was being written

363
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.800
at an astronomical speed.

364
00:23:06.866 --> 00:23:07.934
We figured it was medusa.

365
00:23:08.001 --> 00:23:09.604
<i>I was afraid of that.</i>

366
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.105
<i>The ip was scattered but
I tracked it back to spaceport.</i>

367
00:23:12.173 --> 00:23:15.309
<i>But how could medusa be
responsible for all of this?</i>

368
00:23:15.376 --> 00:23:17.177
What if someone hacked into it?

369
00:23:17.244 --> 00:23:18.679
It's gotta be.

370
00:23:18.747 --> 00:23:20.514
No. The coding strings
were unlike anything

371
00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:21.915
that I've ever seen.

372
00:23:21.981 --> 00:23:23.783
They were shorthand.
like a stenographer.

373
00:23:23.851 --> 00:23:26.488
This...
This coding doesn't exist!

374
00:23:26.554 --> 00:23:29.523
But why would it
be targeting us?

375
00:23:29.589 --> 00:23:31.291
It's targeting me.

376
00:23:31.358 --> 00:23:35.062
Because it knows you're
Dr. Abel Lopez's daughter!

377
00:23:35.128 --> 00:23:36.830
<i>I think it came after me</i>

378
00:23:36.897 --> 00:23:38.641
<i>because I used the exact
same quantum language</i>

379
00:23:38.665 --> 00:23:41.403
<i>as my dad when I hacked the dod.</i>

380
00:23:41.469 --> 00:23:43.337
<i>Tara sent a bullet
into the heart</i>

381
00:23:43.403 --> 00:23:45.506
<i>of the us military cyber system.</i>

382
00:23:45.573 --> 00:23:47.108
We saw.

383
00:23:47.173 --> 00:23:49.109
<i>But this isn't the military.</i>

384
00:23:49.176 --> 00:23:50.888
<i>Medusa has gone rogue and it's
not just targeting you.</i>

385
00:23:50.912 --> 00:23:52.713
<i>It's targeting everyone.</i>

386
00:24:07.528 --> 00:24:08.895
Look. I don't have long.

387
00:24:08.962 --> 00:24:10.597
This place is
crawling with drones.

388
00:24:10.664 --> 00:24:12.365
<i>I'm the only one now
who's perfectly fluent</i>

389
00:24:12.432 --> 00:24:14.268
<i>at coding in my
dad's qbit language.</i>

390
00:24:14.335 --> 00:24:18.271
Medusa runs at a quantum system.
so its language is qbit based.

391
00:24:18.338 --> 00:24:21.142
<i>I might be able to hack it.
but I need hands-on access.</i>

392
00:24:21.209 --> 00:24:23.376
But. Tara. that's not an
impossible language to crack.

393
00:24:23.443 --> 00:24:25.488
The Pentagon has programmers
who work on those systems.

394
00:24:25.512 --> 00:24:27.280
<i>My dad added variants
to the code.</i>

395
00:24:27.347 --> 00:24:29.316
<i>variants that I know
from him teaching me.</i>

396
00:24:29.383 --> 00:24:32.586
<i>Not even marietta is as good
as I am at this kind of code.</i>

397
00:24:32.653 --> 00:24:34.231
<i>It will take other
programmers way too long</i>

398
00:24:34.255 --> 00:24:36.590
<i>to figure it out. including him.</i>

399
00:24:36.656 --> 00:24:39.125
<i>Listen. the ai wants to target
and kill every possible threat.</i>

400
00:24:39.192 --> 00:24:40.994
<i>We need to stop it. Now.</i>

401
00:24:41.061 --> 00:24:43.129
So who's gonna stop it?

402
00:24:43.196 --> 00:24:44.464
We are.

403
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.299
We gotta work quickly.

404
00:24:46.366 --> 00:24:48.836
<i>Wilson. we used to hang out at
the spaceport in the summer.</i>

405
00:24:48.903 --> 00:24:50.605
<i>Remember? We know this place.</i>

406
00:24:50.671 --> 00:24:52.151
<i>We used to look up
at the stars there.</i>

407
00:24:52.207 --> 00:24:55.109
I remember! But there's no way.

408
00:24:55.175 --> 00:24:56.352
Listen. I'm not asking you
to go back.

409
00:24:56.376 --> 00:24:57.811
I'm going.

410
00:24:57.878 --> 00:24:59.846
No! Gray scout. you don't know
what you're saying!

411
00:24:59.913 --> 00:25:01.481
Listen. if I don't
stop it before

412
00:25:01.548 --> 00:25:03.017
the upload sequence completes.

413
00:25:03.084 --> 00:25:05.219
<i>the possibility of medusa
overriding all</i>

414
00:25:05.286 --> 00:25:07.654
<i>computers and satellites.
basically everything.</i>

415
00:25:07.721 --> 00:25:09.623
<i>in a relatively short time is...</i>

416
00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.493
You're not a one-person army!
They have people for this!

417
00:25:12.558 --> 00:25:14.894
A system like that has
totally unique hardware. Tara.

418
00:25:14.961 --> 00:25:16.330
Z's right.

419
00:25:16.396 --> 00:25:18.732
Its circuitry
and subzero-Kelvin cooling

420
00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:20.300
are one-of-a-kind.

421
00:25:20.367 --> 00:25:23.236
Yes. that's why I have
to go spaceport directly.

422
00:25:23.304 --> 00:25:25.773
No. Tara. we need
tons of processing

423
00:25:25.839 --> 00:25:27.107
and an open-source platform.

424
00:25:27.174 --> 00:25:28.875
No. If I hack it over a network.

425
00:25:28.942 --> 00:25:30.187
that would allow it
to track me down

426
00:25:30.211 --> 00:25:31.878
as soon as I enter
a single line.

427
00:25:31.945 --> 00:25:34.682
<i>Its nationwide networking
defenses are too powerful</i>

428
00:25:34.749 --> 00:25:37.315
<i>and too advanced for
me to hack it remotely.</i>

429
00:25:37.317 --> 00:25:39.920
I need to be there in person
to patch it in directly

430
00:25:39.987 --> 00:25:41.288
and set a quantum-data bomb.

431
00:25:41.355 --> 00:25:42.923
Tara. you're gonna need help!

432
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.234
Any smart weapons
there will kill you

433
00:25:44.258 --> 00:25:46.026
as soon as you get close
to the ai!

434
00:25:46.093 --> 00:25:47.662
No. no. no. Don't try to help.

435
00:25:47.728 --> 00:25:49.830
Anybody who tries to help
is gonna get us traced.

436
00:25:49.896 --> 00:25:51.331
targeted and killed.

437
00:25:51.397 --> 00:25:54.534
Tara. I'm not just gonna
let you die out there!

438
00:25:54.602 --> 00:25:57.138
You're too important
to all of us!

439
00:25:57.204 --> 00:25:59.139
Plus. you're only
a couple hours away.

440
00:25:59.205 --> 00:26:00.774
<i>If you need a direct patch.</i>

441
00:26:00.842 --> 00:26:02.218
then you'll also need someone
to map out the mainframe

442
00:26:02.242 --> 00:26:03.811
to send out the data bomb.

443
00:26:03.877 --> 00:26:05.545
If everyone at the spaceport
gets killed.

444
00:26:05.612 --> 00:26:08.816
you'll still need someone
to help you get it.

445
00:26:08.883 --> 00:26:11.117
If you're going. I'm going.

446
00:26:11.184 --> 00:26:12.619
We're gonna stop it with you.

447
00:26:12.685 --> 00:26:15.155
When you reach huntsville.
we'll be there.

448
00:26:15.222 --> 00:26:18.725
You may be a genius hacker.
but you can't do this alone.

449
00:26:18.792 --> 00:26:20.460
<i>You're gonna be outnumbered.</i>

450
00:26:20.528 --> 00:26:21.871
<i>so you're gonna need people
that you can trust.</i>

451
00:26:21.895 --> 00:26:23.330
Let us help you.

452
00:26:23.396 --> 00:26:25.265
Hey. we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

453
00:26:27.468 --> 00:26:28.870
All right.

454
00:26:28.935 --> 00:26:30.737
Meet us at the spaceport.

455
00:26:30.804 --> 00:26:34.208
I'm going to need my dark web
contact to make this happen.

456
00:26:34.273 --> 00:26:36.276
<i>We're gonna need red dragon.</i>

457
00:26:37.345 --> 00:26:38.377
Red dragon?

458
00:26:38.444 --> 00:26:40.013
Really. gray?
Are you sure about that?

459
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.815
Do we have any other choice?

460
00:26:41.883 --> 00:26:43.851
<i>It's at least a six-hour drive
for us to get there</i>

461
00:26:43.916 --> 00:26:45.795
<i>and we'll need every second
to get ahead of the ai</i>

462
00:26:45.819 --> 00:26:47.621
<i>as it smashes firewalls.</i>

463
00:26:47.688 --> 00:26:50.024
<i>To do that. we'll need gear
to fight against the drones</i>

464
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:52.558
<i>and anything else medusa
throws at us.</i>

465
00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:55.162
Plus. she owes me a favor.

466
00:26:55.229 --> 00:26:56.730
I don't know. Tara.

467
00:26:56.798 --> 00:26:58.766
<i>No one messes with red dragon.</i>

468
00:26:58.833 --> 00:27:00.167
Not even the feds!

469
00:27:00.233 --> 00:27:04.804
Her and I have
an understanding. okay?

470
00:27:04.872 --> 00:27:08.175
Wilson. meet us.
but be careful. No tech!

471
00:27:08.241 --> 00:27:10.043
Okay. remember
they will find you.

472
00:27:10.109 --> 00:27:11.745
There's cameras everywhere.

473
00:27:11.813 --> 00:27:14.915
So don't bring any microphones.
Internet connections.

474
00:27:14.981 --> 00:27:17.550
anything with digital cameras.

475
00:27:17.617 --> 00:27:19.887
anything that
can trace you to me.

476
00:27:21.321 --> 00:27:23.756
Tara! Tara! They found you!

477
00:27:23.824 --> 00:27:25.226
You're on my screen!

478
00:27:28.362 --> 00:27:30.096
And if you're on my screen...

479
00:27:30.163 --> 00:27:31.900
That means they found us.

480
00:27:35.869 --> 00:27:37.604
Zee! Zee!

481
00:27:37.672 --> 00:27:38.771
Go! Go! Go!

482
00:27:38.838 --> 00:27:40.173
I'm on it.

483
00:27:42.308 --> 00:27:43.610
Come on. come on. come on!

484
00:27:50.384 --> 00:27:53.253
Okay. we gotta go! Come on!
Come on!

485
00:28:12.839 --> 00:28:14.241
Wait.

486
00:28:15.476 --> 00:28:16.544
Do you hear that?

487
00:28:20.614 --> 00:28:22.350
Drones.

488
00:28:22.416 --> 00:28:24.084
Now what?

489
00:28:25.952 --> 00:28:27.054
I can hear them.

490
00:28:27.121 --> 00:28:28.889
Come on. come on.

491
00:28:28.955 --> 00:28:31.275
It's not pretty. but I have
something that will protect us.

492
00:28:36.163 --> 00:28:37.397
What is it?

493
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:39.967
They're getting closer!

494
00:28:40.034 --> 00:28:41.302
Two seconds.

495
00:28:56.817 --> 00:28:58.085
What was that?

496
00:28:58.152 --> 00:29:00.453
Invisibility cloak.
Military grade.

497
00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.088
How did you get your
hands on that?

498
00:29:02.155 --> 00:29:03.423
They're not available.

499
00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:04.959
I wasn't waiting.
I created my own.

500
00:29:05.026 --> 00:29:06.693
Okay.

501
00:29:18.872 --> 00:29:22.442
Red dragon should be here!

502
00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:23.509
This way. hurry.

503
00:29:35.388 --> 00:29:36.690
This is gonna take all day.

504
00:29:40.928 --> 00:29:43.131
That's it! The antenna!

505
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:58.646
You're crazy. No one's here.

506
00:30:02.983 --> 00:30:04.217
There it is.

507
00:30:13.994 --> 00:30:16.530
Okay. but how do you know that?

508
00:30:20.567 --> 00:30:24.605
Gmc automotive put on an early
camper prototype in the 80s.

509
00:30:26.507 --> 00:30:28.209
They called it the dragon.

510
00:30:31.111 --> 00:30:32.413
Really?

511
00:30:33.881 --> 00:30:37.817
That... and I can see a
grounded hub of cat7 wires

512
00:30:37.884 --> 00:30:40.153
underneath the chassis.

513
00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.089
And about four. five.

514
00:30:43.156 --> 00:30:44.759
six routers attached
to the roof.

515
00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:51.230
not to mention three remotes
in the surrounding trees

516
00:30:51.298 --> 00:30:55.068
there. there. and there.

517
00:30:55.135 --> 00:30:56.737
You missed 10
satellite transmitters.

518
00:30:56.803 --> 00:30:59.439
and about three miles of
cabling and ground wires.

519
00:30:59.506 --> 00:31:02.176
and a whole lotta scramblers.

520
00:31:02.242 --> 00:31:03.477
Come on in.

521
00:31:16.222 --> 00:31:17.390
It's okay. You're safe here.

522
00:31:17.457 --> 00:31:19.794
Come on. gray scout. Let's go.

523
00:31:19.861 --> 00:31:21.395
I've been monitoring
you for a while.

524
00:31:23.864 --> 00:31:26.299
You're in an anti-emp
Van. fully-loaded.

525
00:31:26.365 --> 00:31:28.836
lead-lined. off the grid.

526
00:31:28.902 --> 00:31:31.305
Medusa can't see us.
at least not yet.

527
00:31:31.371 --> 00:31:36.677
Off the grid?
With that electronic footprint?

528
00:31:36.743 --> 00:31:38.211
Catch your breath.

529
00:31:38.278 --> 00:31:40.448
Thanks.

530
00:31:40.515 --> 00:31:41.682
Drink.

531
00:31:43.282 --> 00:31:44.684
I saw what happened.

532
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.520
Good job with those drones.
by the way.

533
00:31:47.586 --> 00:31:49.890
I must say. I really am
impressed you made it here.

534
00:31:49.957 --> 00:31:52.860
I didn't think
you'd still be here.

535
00:31:52.925 --> 00:31:54.261
Well. not after this.

536
00:31:54.327 --> 00:31:55.871
You two have more heat
on you than an lhc

537
00:31:55.895 --> 00:31:57.563
in a pressure vacuum.

538
00:31:57.631 --> 00:32:00.000
If medusa hasn't
figured out already. she will.

539
00:32:00.067 --> 00:32:02.044
She'll be in full control
within the next couple hours.

540
00:32:02.068 --> 00:32:03.937
maybe even sooner.

541
00:32:07.374 --> 00:32:09.477
I'm sorry about your dad.
but screw him.

542
00:32:10.711 --> 00:32:12.378
Excuse me?

543
00:32:12.445 --> 00:32:15.415
Hey. it's his machine that's
going to destroy the world.

544
00:32:15.481 --> 00:32:17.017
Look. I'm sure
he's a cool guy and all

545
00:32:17.084 --> 00:32:19.019
and took you to space camp
when you were younger.

546
00:32:19.085 --> 00:32:21.087
But he gets no passes.

547
00:32:21.154 --> 00:32:23.757
My dad was creating machines
to help save people.

548
00:32:23.824 --> 00:32:26.159
Yeah. it wasn't his fault.
Medusa's the one who...

549
00:32:26.226 --> 00:32:27.862
Really?

550
00:32:27.929 --> 00:32:29.906
Because if he didn't exist.
the medusa wouldn't exist.

551
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.734
But he did and it does.
so here we are.

552
00:32:35.535 --> 00:32:37.237
We're trying to stop it.

553
00:32:37.304 --> 00:32:38.572
You can't.

554
00:32:38.638 --> 00:32:40.674
- We're trying.
- It's self-aware.

555
00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.977
It's building an army. It's...

556
00:32:43.042 --> 00:32:44.744
A machine.

557
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:46.989
No. Then you go unplug it. but
you know it's not that easy.

558
00:32:47.013 --> 00:32:48.414
It's not just a machine.

559
00:32:48.481 --> 00:32:51.684
It's a cancer
that's metastasizing.

560
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:55.021
We can stop it before the
upload sequence completes.

561
00:32:55.087 --> 00:32:58.057
I know what it's capable of.
We've already seen it.

562
00:32:58.125 --> 00:33:00.661
It's gonna seize
the world's military.

563
00:33:02.829 --> 00:33:03.997
Of course it is.

564
00:33:04.065 --> 00:33:05.599
Okay.

565
00:33:05.664 --> 00:33:07.276
So that means it not only
needs to run a search function

566
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.801
to find weapons.

567
00:33:08.868 --> 00:33:10.847
But it also has to teach
itself to break the firewalls.

568
00:33:10.871 --> 00:33:12.973
then it has to hack
them around the world.

569
00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:17.845
Even on a quantum system. that
buys us. what. 15. 20 minutes?

570
00:33:17.912 --> 00:33:19.779
That gives you nothing.

571
00:33:19.846 --> 00:33:21.249
It's something.

572
00:33:23.148 --> 00:33:24.584
Even on your best day.

573
00:33:24.651 --> 00:33:28.087
it took you 10 minutes
to hack the world bank.

574
00:33:28.154 --> 00:33:30.156
It's gonna take us at
least that amount of time

575
00:33:30.222 --> 00:33:31.491
to hack a quantum ai.

576
00:33:31.558 --> 00:33:34.862
so we don't have
10 minutes to waste.

577
00:33:34.928 --> 00:33:36.864
We're gonna need
analog transportation

578
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.900
and as much analog tech
and weapons as we can carry.

579
00:33:39.967 --> 00:33:43.803
You can't hide
from surveillance.

580
00:33:43.869 --> 00:33:46.472
You've been telling me you
liked my qbit-level coding

581
00:33:46.539 --> 00:33:48.442
and reference-free algorithms.

582
00:33:48.508 --> 00:33:50.277
Oh. come on. That's not fair.

583
00:33:50.344 --> 00:33:52.446
I gave you every
closed-source q codes

584
00:33:52.512 --> 00:33:55.749
to get you an
unbreakable ghost ip.

585
00:33:55.816 --> 00:33:57.683
I knew this day would come.
It always does.

586
00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:00.488
Desperate and
morally compromised.

587
00:34:03.123 --> 00:34:05.424
You still owe me.

588
00:34:05.491 --> 00:34:07.360
That ip got my place swatted!

589
00:34:11.097 --> 00:34:12.565
I hope the heist was worth it.

590
00:34:13.934 --> 00:34:16.903
Hey. I ran a trace
of medusa's first few lines

591
00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:18.672
of code under your ip.

592
00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:20.673
It crashed my burner system.

593
00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.409
I need to be there in person.
no networks!

594
00:34:23.476 --> 00:34:25.077
It's the only way.

595
00:34:25.144 --> 00:34:28.148
It'll have to be a sysconfig
databomb sliding-base

596
00:34:28.215 --> 00:34:29.682
so I can mess with its power.

597
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.052
Only then can it be
destroyed. physically.

598
00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:33.729
Okay. but you'll need
someone to map the interface

599
00:34:33.753 --> 00:34:35.456
to make that bomb
deliverable. though.

600
00:34:35.521 --> 00:34:37.490
assuming the ai
doesn't kill them first.

601
00:34:37.557 --> 00:34:40.594
I'm not willing to
fall on that sword.

602
00:34:40.661 --> 00:34:41.996
We're not asking.

603
00:34:43.931 --> 00:34:47.134
I assume you destroyed all your
traceable software and info?

604
00:34:47.201 --> 00:34:48.735
Hibachi style.

605
00:34:48.802 --> 00:34:50.403
Yeah. it's all fried.

606
00:34:50.471 --> 00:34:52.139
What we didn't burn.
the drones did.

607
00:34:52.206 --> 00:34:53.673
Good. yeah.

608
00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:56.109
Well. if anything happens
to me. I have black fire.

609
00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:57.678
It's my kill-all virus.

610
00:34:57.744 --> 00:35:00.947
I have one.
my cousin Derek has the other.

611
00:35:01.014 --> 00:35:02.782
He's my fail-safe.

612
00:35:02.849 --> 00:35:05.050
Hey. here.
We got one of the drones.

613
00:35:05.117 --> 00:35:07.020
It was pretty banged up
from the fireworks.

614
00:35:07.088 --> 00:35:10.457
But Jorge managed
to rip out the brains.

615
00:35:10.523 --> 00:35:13.760
I figured it's configured for
military networking commands.

616
00:35:13.827 --> 00:35:16.963
so I can probably use it to hack
the system over at spaceport.

617
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.030
Let me see that.

618
00:35:24.538 --> 00:35:27.708
Yeah. this is nothing like what
we've seen on the black market.

619
00:35:27.775 --> 00:35:30.844
Besides having an obscene
amount of memory.

620
00:35:30.911 --> 00:35:35.215
it's got an unusual
audio receiver right here.

621
00:35:35.282 --> 00:35:39.820
Its sensitivity is measured
in 10.000ths of a hertz.

622
00:35:39.887 --> 00:35:42.222
I can't really figure out why.

623
00:35:42.289 --> 00:35:44.824
And a weird looking solenoid.

624
00:35:44.891 --> 00:35:46.827
Yeah. That hooks up
to a capacitor

625
00:35:46.893 --> 00:35:48.628
that takes
its electrical load way up.

626
00:35:48.695 --> 00:35:50.797
but I'm still not sure why.

627
00:35:50.864 --> 00:35:52.465
Almost like defibrillator.

628
00:35:52.532 --> 00:35:53.934
It closes in on a person.

629
00:35:54.001 --> 00:35:56.870
then electrocutes them
in the chest or the head.

630
00:35:56.936 --> 00:35:59.639
Quite an efficient killing
instead of blowing someone up.

631
00:36:01.442 --> 00:36:02.643
Here. look.

632
00:36:10.751 --> 00:36:12.153
It didn't shoot 'em.

633
00:36:12.219 --> 00:36:14.253
Right. but the targeting
system of the drones

634
00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.588
show a huge electrical spike.

635
00:36:16.655 --> 00:36:18.257
Heart attack maybe?

636
00:36:18.324 --> 00:36:19.859
Maybe.

637
00:36:19.925 --> 00:36:21.929
I've never seen that
on a military drone before.

638
00:36:21.996 --> 00:36:24.431
but it could be.

639
00:36:24.498 --> 00:36:29.869
Tara. this ai is
nothing to play with.

640
00:36:29.936 --> 00:36:32.206
Yeah. it's probably
how it killed my dad.

641
00:36:34.541 --> 00:36:35.909
I'm sorry I showed you that.

642
00:36:35.976 --> 00:36:38.679
but if it helps.
I don't think he suffered.

643
00:36:38.746 --> 00:36:40.180
It's like he shut down

644
00:36:40.246 --> 00:36:41.923
and you were right to
keep the drone brain.

645
00:36:41.947 --> 00:36:43.951
If you hard patch this to
a security network

646
00:36:44.016 --> 00:36:45.818
you can gain access
to a restricted area

647
00:36:45.885 --> 00:36:47.153
if it thinks you're a drone.

648
00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:50.757
So although the ai
has insane ability

649
00:36:50.824 --> 00:36:53.760
to make very accurate
probabilistic choices

650
00:36:53.827 --> 00:36:56.664
and track everything you do.

651
00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:00.300
it still sees people as
people and tech as tech.

652
00:37:00.367 --> 00:37:03.003
And don't forget. it can track
you almost everywhere you go.

653
00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:06.873
You mean. like
via orbital satellites?

654
00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.108
No. no.

655
00:37:08.175 --> 00:37:10.943
It's working its way
to that. but no.

656
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:15.215
Tara. it knows
everything about you.

657
00:37:15.282 --> 00:37:17.784
It knows everyone
you've ever known.

658
00:37:17.851 --> 00:37:19.720
It knows our history online.

659
00:37:22.722 --> 00:37:25.425
So that it probably knows
that I'm here.

660
00:37:25.492 --> 00:37:27.259
Yes. and when it's
looking for you.

661
00:37:27.327 --> 00:37:28.762
it uses things like that drone

662
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:30.364
that can hear a fly
in a beehive.

663
00:37:30.429 --> 00:37:33.199
It's not gonna let
some hacker stand in the way

664
00:37:33.266 --> 00:37:34.533
of it destroying the world.

665
00:37:34.601 --> 00:37:36.537
Do you get it?

666
00:37:41.474 --> 00:37:43.009
This is an emp pulse grenade.

667
00:37:43.076 --> 00:37:45.545
Once activated. you have
five seconds to hit your target

668
00:37:45.612 --> 00:37:47.113
before an emp blast.

669
00:37:47.179 --> 00:37:50.115
canceling out all electronics
within a 50-yard radius.

670
00:37:50.182 --> 00:37:52.052
So. you wanna stay way
clear of it.

671
00:37:55.789 --> 00:37:57.924
Do you have your
quantum tablet on you?

672
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.960
This is your
father's technology.

673
00:38:00.027 --> 00:38:03.963
I'm gonna download a nano cloak
shield to your quantum tablet.

674
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:05.899
Also. this not only
refracts light

675
00:38:05.965 --> 00:38:07.833
to make you invisible
to cameras.

676
00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.134
but is also a penrose polymer

677
00:38:09.202 --> 00:38:11.472
which cancels out
all heat signatures

678
00:38:11.538 --> 00:38:13.173
and that includes
radar or sonar.

679
00:38:13.239 --> 00:38:15.241
- You got all that?
- Invisibility. Copy.

680
00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:17.077
We need firepower.

681
00:38:17.143 --> 00:38:19.778
It thinks we're terrorists. it
keep on firing missiles at us.

682
00:38:19.846 --> 00:38:21.847
You have to stop
taking this personal.

683
00:38:21.914 --> 00:38:25.351
To medusa. you are only an
answer to a binary question.

684
00:38:25.418 --> 00:38:27.621
And what's the question?

685
00:38:27.686 --> 00:38:30.790
How do I stop
her from deprogramming me?

686
00:38:31.891 --> 00:38:33.993
Either way. you'll need this.

687
00:38:35.061 --> 00:38:37.597
This is an ak-47.
fully automatic.

688
00:38:37.664 --> 00:38:39.800
Safety's here. trigger's here.

689
00:38:39.865 --> 00:38:42.735
They're hard to come by.
so you're gonna need it.

690
00:38:42.802 --> 00:38:44.872
You know how to shoot?

691
00:38:44.938 --> 00:38:48.976
My dad was a gun guy. took me
to the range a few times.

692
00:38:51.244 --> 00:38:52.913
Good.

693
00:38:54.313 --> 00:38:55.848
Here. look at this.

694
00:38:57.918 --> 00:39:00.120
This is happening now.
all over the world?

695
00:39:08.827 --> 00:39:10.963
Damn. that's medusa?

696
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.532
Yes. and this is just a start.

697
00:39:12.599 --> 00:39:14.501
Medusa is throwing
Moore's law out the window.

698
00:39:14.567 --> 00:39:17.905
Once it seizes access to it.
it's gonna take advantage of it.

699
00:39:19.405 --> 00:39:21.041
This is nuts.

700
00:39:21.108 --> 00:39:23.544
Medusa was created to help
my dad's nfx rescue robot.

701
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.277
It was designed
to help save people.

702
00:39:25.344 --> 00:39:26.746
Maybe it is.

703
00:39:26.813 --> 00:39:28.213
Maybe it's saving us
from ourselves.

704
00:39:30.016 --> 00:39:31.652
No one deserves this.

705
00:39:32.684 --> 00:39:34.020
Maybe not.

706
00:39:34.086 --> 00:39:36.989
<i>Red dragon! Come in. red dragon!</i>

707
00:39:37.056 --> 00:39:37.823
Come in.

708
00:39:37.891 --> 00:39:39.226
This is red dragon.

709
00:39:39.291 --> 00:39:41.893
<i>It's me. Derek! Can you hear me?</i>

710
00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.029
It's my cousin Derek.

711
00:39:43.096 --> 00:39:44.398
<i>You were right. red dragon.</i>

712
00:39:44.463 --> 00:39:46.900
<i>Medusa isn't just using drones.</i>

713
00:39:46.965 --> 00:39:48.568
<i>I'm headed back to the compound.</i>

714
00:39:48.635 --> 00:39:50.004
<i>I'll call you when I get there.</i>

715
00:39:52.304 --> 00:39:53.706
<i>Look alive. boys!</i>

716
00:39:53.773 --> 00:39:55.208
<i>We're getting hit
from all sides!</i>

717
00:39:55.275 --> 00:39:56.910
<i>We're dealing with cyborgs here.</i>

718
00:39:56.976 --> 00:39:59.313
<i>I can hold them off for now.
but hurry!</i>

719
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.747
Derek!

720
00:40:00.813 --> 00:40:02.615
What is he talking about?

721
00:40:02.681 --> 00:40:04.350
What cyborg machines?

722
00:40:04.418 --> 00:40:06.854
It's the Ares project.
I don't know much about it.

723
00:40:08.855 --> 00:40:10.088
It's black ops.

724
00:40:10.155 --> 00:40:12.157
Used for military
high target asserts.

725
00:40:12.224 --> 00:40:14.893
I was afraid that if medusa
was able to control the system.

726
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.296
this would be the first thing
it would control.

727
00:40:17.364 --> 00:40:19.632
- What?
- Jorge. come on.

728
00:40:19.699 --> 00:40:23.069
What makes these ultra scary
is that they shoot microchips.

729
00:40:23.137 --> 00:40:24.471
What?

730
00:40:24.536 --> 00:40:27.306
Microchips that take over
your body and control you.

731
00:40:27.373 --> 00:40:29.108
Wait. Control you how?

732
00:40:29.175 --> 00:40:31.412
They're designed to attach
to the central nervous system

733
00:40:31.478 --> 00:40:33.746
of humans. controlling
and subduing them.

734
00:40:33.813 --> 00:40:36.949
If medusa is able to hack
into those chips.

735
00:40:37.016 --> 00:40:39.518
they can directly
control human behavior.

736
00:40:39.585 --> 00:40:43.056
Kill yourself.
your fellow soldier. anything.

737
00:40:44.958 --> 00:40:48.061
It just gets worse and worse.

738
00:40:48.126 --> 00:40:51.130
All right. so if medusa
has control of the Ares project.

739
00:40:51.197 --> 00:40:54.067
then that means she's gaining
control faster than we know it?

740
00:40:55.768 --> 00:40:58.137
Medusa is seizing
networks across

741
00:40:58.204 --> 00:41:00.239
the entire globe right now.

742
00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.282
Damn it!

743
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:11.617
The drones have entered
my five-mile perimeter.

744
00:41:11.684 --> 00:41:13.719
Medusa found us.

745
00:41:13.786 --> 00:41:15.688
Jorge. drive the Van!

746
00:41:15.755 --> 00:41:17.191
Go!

747
00:42:07.673 --> 00:42:09.041
Hey!

748
00:42:09.108 --> 00:42:11.144
Take this. take this.

749
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:14.080
Everything is fully supplied.
all right?

750
00:42:19.186 --> 00:42:21.164
Listen. this is a map to my
cousin Derek's compound.

751
00:42:21.188 --> 00:42:22.523
Wave this out of the window

752
00:42:22.588 --> 00:42:24.557
as you approach so
they know I sent you.

753
00:42:25.791 --> 00:42:27.460
Hey. thanks. Brenda.

754
00:42:27.527 --> 00:42:29.061
It's red dragon.

755
00:42:29.128 --> 00:42:31.564
But you can call me Brenda
if you make it back alive.

756
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.232
Come on.

757
00:42:38.672 --> 00:42:40.374
Keys are in the wheel well.

758
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.575
It's old school. No electronics.

759
00:42:42.641 --> 00:42:45.377
No power steering. no power
brakes. no satellite radio?

760
00:42:45.445 --> 00:42:46.646
Thanks. red dragon.

761
00:42:46.713 --> 00:42:49.316
Don't thank me.
Just go save the world.

762
00:42:52.251 --> 00:42:53.853
Shit. I think I hear the drones.

763
00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.188
- Go!
- What about you?

764
00:42:55.255 --> 00:42:56.590
Just go!

765
00:43:15.342 --> 00:43:18.244
Tara!
They're going to lock onto us!

766
00:43:18.311 --> 00:43:19.746
- Hold the wheel!
- What?

767
00:43:19.811 --> 00:43:21.315
Hold the wheel!

768
00:43:27.753 --> 00:43:28.989
Woo!

769
00:43:29.054 --> 00:43:32.291
Let's go! Woo!

770
00:43:33.525 --> 00:43:35.161
What was that thing?

771
00:43:35.228 --> 00:43:37.463
Just another pause
in the time clock.

772
00:43:38.965 --> 00:43:40.534
Woo!

773
00:43:48.141 --> 00:43:50.244
Oh. no. no. no.
What are you doing?

774
00:44:00.286 --> 00:44:01.655
No!

775
00:44:03.356 --> 00:44:06.159
This is gonna feel so good.

776
00:44:21.807 --> 00:44:23.277
Hey...

777
00:44:27.746 --> 00:44:29.248
We got a job to do.

778
00:44:54.273 --> 00:44:55.740
It's only a matter of time.

779
00:44:55.807 --> 00:44:57.210
Shh!

780
00:45:01.813 --> 00:45:03.951
There are phone lines
going into that tunnel.

781
00:45:05.451 --> 00:45:08.054
We hack them and lure
as many of those things

782
00:45:08.119 --> 00:45:09.888
down there as we can.

783
00:45:09.956 --> 00:45:11.557
Then we blow up the tunnel.

784
00:45:12.625 --> 00:45:14.559
You like to blow
things up. right?

785
00:45:14.626 --> 00:45:16.362
You know I do.

786
00:45:16.429 --> 00:45:17.597
Come on.

787
00:45:32.512 --> 00:45:35.148
Hey. a couple more exits.
I gotta pee.

788
00:45:38.751 --> 00:45:40.320
Tara?

789
00:45:41.855 --> 00:45:43.923
Hey. you good?

790
00:45:43.989 --> 00:45:45.125
Huh?

791
00:45:46.626 --> 00:45:48.027
You want a drink?

792
00:45:48.094 --> 00:45:49.596
No. I'm good.

793
00:46:09.849 --> 00:46:11.784
Was that a camera flash?

794
00:46:11.851 --> 00:46:13.353
Huh?

795
00:46:26.766 --> 00:46:28.434
Jesus!

796
00:46:31.003 --> 00:46:32.606
Tara. we got company!

797
00:46:42.481 --> 00:46:43.550
Medusa...

798
00:46:43.617 --> 00:46:46.486
Ah. this is not good!
This is not good!

799
00:46:48.688 --> 00:46:50.289
Jorge. listen to me.

800
00:46:50.356 --> 00:46:52.125
I need you to grab the ak-47
and use it.

801
00:46:52.192 --> 00:46:54.860
Yeah. I got it. I got it.

802
00:46:54.927 --> 00:46:56.528
You ever use an ak-47 before?

803
00:46:56.596 --> 00:46:58.130
What? No!

804
00:46:58.197 --> 00:47:01.366
Today's your lucky day. Take it!

805
00:47:01.434 --> 00:47:04.704
But I don't know...
I don't know how to use it!

806
00:47:04.771 --> 00:47:07.273
Jorge. take the wheel
or use the gun!

807
00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.076
We have very limited
options here!

808
00:47:35.601 --> 00:47:37.204
I'm running out of bullets!

809
00:47:38.505 --> 00:47:40.239
Shit!

810
00:47:40.306 --> 00:47:41.775
Next exit's ours!

811
00:47:52.784 --> 00:47:54.221
Woo!

812
00:47:55.922 --> 00:47:57.289
Shit.

813
00:48:03.862 --> 00:48:06.298
I can hear them.
they're almost here!

814
00:48:06.364 --> 00:48:08.633
Done. The bomb is armed.

815
00:48:08.701 --> 00:48:10.836
There's an exit above us. Hurry!

816
00:48:19.244 --> 00:48:21.280
Nice moves.

817
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:24.183
Whoa. yeah.

818
00:48:25.585 --> 00:48:26.952
We did it.

819
00:48:27.019 --> 00:48:28.721
How many do you think we got?

820
00:48:28.788 --> 00:48:30.222
Dozens.

821
00:48:31.958 --> 00:48:33.259
Come on.

822
00:48:33.326 --> 00:48:34.860
- Let's go to the spaceport.
- Okay.

823
00:48:38.764 --> 00:48:39.798
Whoa.

824
00:48:47.172 --> 00:48:48.540
Get the map from my bag.

825
00:48:48.608 --> 00:48:51.178
Red dragon's cousin
is here somewhere.

826
00:48:53.913 --> 00:48:55.248
Take a right here!

827
00:49:03.088 --> 00:49:05.291
You think we outran 'em?

828
00:49:05.358 --> 00:49:08.428
In this truck? No.

829
00:49:10.063 --> 00:49:11.564
Look out!

830
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:12.932
Ares!

831
00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:36.689
Take a right here.

832
00:49:52.505 --> 00:49:53.740
Welcome. gray scout.

833
00:50:11.657 --> 00:50:13.293
Here's some coffee.

834
00:50:13.358 --> 00:50:14.827
Cici makes it strong.

835
00:50:14.893 --> 00:50:16.895
Thank you.

836
00:50:16.961 --> 00:50:19.264
You guys got an update
on the drone situation?

837
00:50:19.331 --> 00:50:22.034
Yeah. They came in about
half an hour ago.

838
00:50:22.101 --> 00:50:24.569
My sources are saying that the
drones. they're not listening

839
00:50:24.637 --> 00:50:26.539
to any commands from the dod

840
00:50:26.606 --> 00:50:29.242
and they're starting to patrol
in all cities.

841
00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:30.744
Large and small.

842
00:50:33.112 --> 00:50:34.947
Pretty messed up. right?

843
00:50:43.655 --> 00:50:46.192
We got a distress call
coming from the east coast.

844
00:50:46.257 --> 00:50:48.760
They're all over Europe. going
from building to building.

845
00:50:48.827 --> 00:50:52.597
street to street.
wiping 'em all out.

846
00:50:52.664 --> 00:50:53.998
Wait. are these
the Ares sentinels

847
00:50:54.065 --> 00:50:55.000
that red dragon mentioned?

848
00:50:55.067 --> 00:50:56.635
Yep.

849
00:50:56.702 --> 00:50:58.038
We just can't stand down.

850
00:50:58.103 --> 00:51:01.373
not without armor-piercing
ammo at least.

851
00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.141
Just to know what you guys
are up against.

852
00:51:03.208 --> 00:51:06.611
they're taking out
oil refineries. gas stations.

853
00:51:06.679 --> 00:51:08.180
just blowing 'em up.

854
00:51:08.246 --> 00:51:12.150
Uh. listen...

855
00:51:12.217 --> 00:51:13.353
We know.

856
00:51:14.887 --> 00:51:17.057
We knew about red dragon
the second it happened.

857
00:51:19.425 --> 00:51:20.894
Years back. she sent me this.

858
00:51:22.295 --> 00:51:23.596
What is it?

859
00:51:25.465 --> 00:51:27.066
It's a fail-safe.

860
00:51:27.132 --> 00:51:28.766
One lights up blue to check in.

861
00:51:28.833 --> 00:51:31.636
Red for help.
green means she uploaded

862
00:51:31.704 --> 00:51:34.373
some kind of info into
our private server.

863
00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.208
If both are black...

864
00:51:36.275 --> 00:51:37.610
Means her heart stopped.

865
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.715
She talked a lot about you.

866
00:51:42.681 --> 00:51:44.483
She told me to give this to you.

867
00:51:50.356 --> 00:51:51.758
Thank you.

868
00:51:54.027 --> 00:51:56.262
There's an rifd chip
on the back.

869
00:51:56.329 --> 00:51:57.964
I know.

870
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:59.698
Do you know what for?

871
00:51:59.764 --> 00:52:00.665
No.

872
00:52:00.733 --> 00:52:02.168
You're safe here for a minute.

873
00:52:02.233 --> 00:52:04.703
Relax for a second and
take anything you need.

874
00:52:04.771 --> 00:52:06.506
These walls are lead-lined.

875
00:52:06.572 --> 00:52:09.175
And there's cameras up
all over the place.

876
00:52:09.242 --> 00:52:11.010
It used to be a mechanic's shop.

877
00:52:11.077 --> 00:52:15.882
We can put your truck on stilts.
check it out if you like.

878
00:52:15.949 --> 00:52:16.949
Shit!

879
00:52:20.786 --> 00:52:22.253
Yeah.

880
00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.557
Yeah. all right. as long as
there's no oil or gas leaks.

881
00:52:25.623 --> 00:52:27.725
We don't wanna
waste too much time.

882
00:52:27.793 --> 00:52:30.128
Maybe we could check if
there's a tracker on it?

883
00:52:30.195 --> 00:52:33.132
Hopefully. this is enough
to get us to the spaceport.

884
00:52:33.199 --> 00:52:34.567
Let's hope so.

885
00:52:34.634 --> 00:52:36.144
Especially with what
you're up against.

886
00:52:36.168 --> 00:52:37.912
And we'll stock the truck
with gas. food and water.

887
00:52:37.936 --> 00:52:40.271
Yo. look at this!

888
00:52:40.338 --> 00:52:41.974
Hey. hey. hey!

889
00:52:42.041 --> 00:52:43.443
It's loaded. man.

890
00:52:51.516 --> 00:52:52.851
Is that a good luck charm?

891
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.922
Sort of. yeah.

892
00:52:56.989 --> 00:52:58.424
It's kind of helps center me.

893
00:53:01.193 --> 00:53:02.762
It was my dad's.

894
00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:04.397
He was spinning it
the first time

895
00:53:04.463 --> 00:53:06.431
he taught me quantum computing.

896
00:53:06.498 --> 00:53:10.669
I thought I knew so much about
hacking and coding as a kid.

897
00:53:10.737 --> 00:53:12.405
Like I had all the
secrets to the universe

898
00:53:12.472 --> 00:53:14.674
figured out in zeroes and ones.

899
00:53:18.978 --> 00:53:21.114
- Then he showed me.
- Showed you what?

900
00:53:23.114 --> 00:53:26.985
If I asked you to call it
on a flip. heads or tails.

901
00:53:27.052 --> 00:53:28.221
could you do it?

902
00:53:30.255 --> 00:53:31.990
Sure. Heads.

903
00:53:33.092 --> 00:53:34.527
Tails?

904
00:53:37.262 --> 00:53:39.297
Derek's right. Heads.

905
00:53:39.364 --> 00:53:41.666
And that's basic code.

906
00:53:41.733 --> 00:53:43.569
Its either a one or a zero

907
00:53:43.635 --> 00:53:47.039
and it's a 50-50 shot that
either you or I get it right.

908
00:53:49.474 --> 00:53:53.278
But what if it was spinning?

909
00:53:53.346 --> 00:53:55.481
Could you call it?

910
00:53:55.547 --> 00:53:56.781
I don't know.

911
00:53:56.849 --> 00:53:59.184
- Heads?
- Tails.

912
00:53:59.251 --> 00:54:02.187
You're both right.

913
00:54:02.253 --> 00:54:05.924
See. when it's spinning.

914
00:54:05.992 --> 00:54:08.861
it's in a state
of super position.

915
00:54:08.927 --> 00:54:10.530
which means that it's both.

916
00:54:11.697 --> 00:54:13.666
See? Tails. I called it.

917
00:54:13.731 --> 00:54:16.402
In the quantum world.
qbits become entangled.

918
00:54:16.469 --> 00:54:18.070
so no matter how they land.

919
00:54:18.137 --> 00:54:20.606
they always influence and
affect each other.

920
00:54:22.641 --> 00:54:24.876
It's kind of like us.

921
00:54:24.943 --> 00:54:26.646
Whoever we become entangled with

922
00:54:26.713 --> 00:54:29.716
eventually becomes part
of our solution.

923
00:54:31.317 --> 00:54:33.552
I'm more of a heads
or tails guy.

924
00:54:33.619 --> 00:54:35.521
I like to know my odds.

925
00:54:35.588 --> 00:54:37.190
Quiet!

926
00:54:43.228 --> 00:54:44.630
I don't hear it anymore.

927
00:54:45.731 --> 00:54:47.267
Maybe it's gone.

928
00:54:53.505 --> 00:54:57.542
I think that's Dr. Marietta
trying to give us a signal.

929
00:54:57.610 --> 00:55:00.246
Tara? You there? Tara?

930
00:55:00.313 --> 00:55:02.280
<i>Wilson. get off the line.</i>

931
00:55:02.347 --> 00:55:03.916
We have a few minutes.

932
00:55:03.983 --> 00:55:07.119
I'm doing some ir bouncing.
back to my ghosting days.

933
00:55:07.186 --> 00:55:08.253
<i>Where are you?</i>

934
00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.722
Right outside spaceport.

935
00:55:09.789 --> 00:55:11.298
Zee's been working out
the qbit functions

936
00:55:11.322 --> 00:55:14.225
to determine medusa's
rate of expansion.

937
00:55:14.293 --> 00:55:17.697
We got a little less than
85 minutes before it's too late.

938
00:55:17.764 --> 00:55:19.097
Can you do that?

939
00:55:19.164 --> 00:55:20.608
I don't think I can do
much without you.

940
00:55:20.632 --> 00:55:22.366
<i>Yeah. I can do that.</i>

941
00:55:22.434 --> 00:55:26.506
Tara. you're the only one
truly fluent in its language.

942
00:55:26.572 --> 00:55:30.610
but you will need me to map
that interface for you.

943
00:55:30.675 --> 00:55:32.545
You might need
Dr. Marietta's help.

944
00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.446
So he is alive?

945
00:55:34.512 --> 00:55:36.114
Last I saw him.

946
00:55:36.181 --> 00:55:37.981
He was heading in the bunker
with your father.

947
00:55:39.184 --> 00:55:41.320
The bunker looks
like an ancient doorway.

948
00:55:41.387 --> 00:55:42.822
I don't know why.

949
00:55:42.887 --> 00:55:45.123
It has a smart lock system
that I powered down.

950
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:47.458
But it can't be opened
unless he powers it up.

951
00:55:47.525 --> 00:55:48.893
drawing the drones.

952
00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.361
<i>We'll get there asap.</i>

953
00:55:50.429 --> 00:55:52.164
<i>We're armed with
mechanical weapons</i>

954
00:55:52.231 --> 00:55:54.200
<i>and an old school car
they can't trace.</i>

955
00:55:54.266 --> 00:55:57.469
<i>As for Dr. Marietta. we'll
bring tools and manpower</i>

956
00:55:57.536 --> 00:55:58.936
<i>to pry open the lock manually.</i>

957
00:55:59.003 --> 00:56:02.607
No. no! He's sealed
until it powers up.

958
00:56:02.675 --> 00:56:04.052
If I engage the locks
and try to leave.

959
00:56:04.076 --> 00:56:06.378
it'll instantly attract
their attention.

960
00:56:06.445 --> 00:56:08.080
<i>We got inbound hostiles!</i>

961
00:56:08.146 --> 00:56:10.148
<i>We need to get you packed
and out of here now!</i>

962
00:56:10.215 --> 00:56:11.215
<i>Wilson. I...</i>

963
00:56:12.552 --> 00:56:13.684
What's happening?

964
00:56:13.751 --> 00:56:15.353
You lose connection?

965
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:16.722
No. this is on her end.

966
00:56:25.398 --> 00:56:27.798
And. remember.
they can't get in.

967
00:56:27.865 --> 00:56:29.302
Are you sure about that?

968
00:56:31.536 --> 00:56:33.005
Holy shit!

969
00:56:35.807 --> 00:56:37.876
I'm gonna activate the shield.

970
00:56:37.943 --> 00:56:39.311
It's go time!

971
00:56:41.414 --> 00:56:42.681
Guys. we gotta get out of here.

972
00:56:42.748 --> 00:56:43.950
Shh!

973
00:56:45.784 --> 00:56:47.953
They know we're here!
We gotta go now!

974
00:57:08.373 --> 00:57:09.741
Move!

975
00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:17.715
Ah!

976
00:57:17.782 --> 00:57:19.384
Cici! What are you doing?

977
00:57:23.521 --> 00:57:24.891
No!

978
00:57:32.998 --> 00:57:34.700
I seen the specs on Ares.

979
00:57:34.766 --> 00:57:36.534
We can't outrun 'em.
we can't outfight 'em.

980
00:57:36.601 --> 00:57:37.601
The red dragon software!

981
00:57:37.635 --> 00:57:38.936
Did you download it?

982
00:57:39.003 --> 00:57:40.443
The invisibility cloak?
Doing it now.

983
00:57:41.005 --> 00:57:42.406
What are you doing?

984
00:57:42.474 --> 00:57:43.751
This shield refracts
light and absorbs heat.

985
00:57:43.775 --> 00:57:44.710
making us invisible to them.

986
00:57:44.777 --> 00:57:46.913
I hope this works!

987
00:58:21.246 --> 00:58:22.981
Red dragon gave us this
old school car

988
00:58:23.047 --> 00:58:24.382
so we wouldn't be detected.

989
00:58:24.449 --> 00:58:25.929
That's why I drive
these type of cars.

990
00:58:25.983 --> 00:58:28.152
You guys have
everything you... ah!

991
00:58:28.219 --> 00:58:30.522
- Oh! Derek!
- Shit!

992
00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:31.789
- I got it. go!
- Damn it!

993
00:58:31.856 --> 00:58:33.092
Go!

994
00:58:55.614 --> 00:58:57.349
Ah!

995
00:59:20.606 --> 00:59:21.908
How are you doing?

996
00:59:23.541 --> 00:59:25.110
What the hell is that?

997
00:59:32.583 --> 00:59:33.951
You gotta be shitting me.

998
00:59:34.018 --> 00:59:35.387
What do we do?

999
00:59:37.889 --> 00:59:39.291
Let's see what Derek gave us.

1000
00:59:51.469 --> 00:59:53.504
Rpg grenade launcher!

1001
00:59:53.572 --> 00:59:55.173
You ready for this?

1002
01:00:04.916 --> 01:00:06.318
Keep it steady!

1003
01:00:07.918 --> 01:00:09.288
I'm trying!

1004
01:00:10.356 --> 01:00:11.424
Get closer!

1005
01:00:16.027 --> 01:00:19.097
- Closer!
- I'm driving!

1006
01:00:20.865 --> 01:00:22.068
Jorge!

1007
01:00:22.134 --> 01:00:23.969
I'm trying!

1008
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:27.105
Ah!

1009
01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:31.409
Yah!

1010
01:00:40.753 --> 01:00:42.487
This is bad. zee.

1011
01:00:42.554 --> 01:00:45.257
There's Ares and drones
patrolling this whole area.

1012
01:00:45.324 --> 01:00:47.159
I hope Tara has
more firepower than this.

1013
01:00:47.226 --> 01:00:49.461
Hey. my ieds got us
this far. didn't they?

1014
01:00:52.764 --> 01:00:55.468
She's tough. okay?

1015
01:00:55.534 --> 01:00:58.470
She kicked our butts in
the hacking competition.

1016
01:00:58.536 --> 01:00:59.672
She'll be here.

1017
01:01:04.409 --> 01:01:06.177
You know you can't use that.

1018
01:01:06.244 --> 01:01:08.079
not now.
not when we're so close.

1019
01:01:08.146 --> 01:01:09.248
I know. I...

1020
01:01:09.315 --> 01:01:11.150
I just wanna know if she's okay.

1021
01:01:11.215 --> 01:01:12.918
She's fine.

1022
01:01:14.353 --> 01:01:16.954
- Oh! Damn it!
- Whoa!

1023
01:01:17.021 --> 01:01:18.690
- Jorge!
- Jorge!

1024
01:01:18.757 --> 01:01:20.224
Jorge!

1025
01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:22.494
Oh. my god. you scared me. man.

1026
01:01:23.661 --> 01:01:24.864
Where's Tara?

1027
01:01:24.929 --> 01:01:26.764
She still at the bunker or...

1028
01:01:26.831 --> 01:01:28.166
No.

1029
01:01:29.635 --> 01:01:30.669
What?

1030
01:01:30.735 --> 01:01:32.438
She... she...

1031
01:01:32.505 --> 01:01:34.972
The Ares. they're
getting massive updates

1032
01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:36.675
every nanosecond.

1033
01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.876
They came out of nowhere.

1034
01:01:37.943 --> 01:01:39.345
I'm so sorry.

1035
01:01:41.246 --> 01:01:42.581
We need to find marietta.

1036
01:01:42.648 --> 01:01:44.615
He can put a stop to this.

1037
01:01:44.682 --> 01:01:46.284
Just grab what you need.

1038
01:01:46.351 --> 01:01:47.786
I don't know what I need.

1039
01:01:47.853 --> 01:01:49.253
Then don't grab anything. right?

1040
01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.222
Come on! Let's go!

1041
01:01:53.893 --> 01:01:56.262
Okay?

1042
01:01:58.664 --> 01:02:00.140
Are you sure that
using the drone brain

1043
01:02:00.164 --> 01:02:01.733
to trigger the lock
is going to work?

1044
01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.711
I mean. it still shares
the same formatting protocols

1045
01:02:03.735 --> 01:02:05.570
as the ai.

1046
01:02:05.637 --> 01:02:07.582
That's exactly why
it won't get the ai's attention.

1047
01:02:07.606 --> 01:02:10.342
The ai will read it
as a drone trigger

1048
01:02:10.409 --> 01:02:12.144
in the lock instead of a person

1049
01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:14.679
as part of its
safety protocol. right?

1050
01:02:14.746 --> 01:02:20.085
So if we do want to destroy
the Ares and the drones.

1051
01:02:20.152 --> 01:02:23.856
then Jorge and I already
worked it out. All right?

1052
01:02:23.922 --> 01:02:28.126
Even the smartest ai
doesn't think like us.

1053
01:02:28.193 --> 01:02:30.328
It does everything

1054
01:02:30.394 --> 01:02:34.365
in the most perfect
way possible.

1055
01:02:34.432 --> 01:02:37.668
It doesn't take into account
the quantity of people

1056
01:02:37.735 --> 01:02:41.005
or the amount of those
who are heavily armed.

1057
01:02:41.072 --> 01:02:46.411
So once we destroy that Ares
and we get the doctor out.

1058
01:02:48.246 --> 01:02:51.216
we send Jorge with the
majority of our weapons.

1059
01:02:51.282 --> 01:02:55.186
And then zee. you and I.
we go to the spaceport.

1060
01:02:55.253 --> 01:02:57.155
What do you mean.
the majority of our weapons?

1061
01:02:57.222 --> 01:02:59.291
Whoever has the most weapons
and is using them

1062
01:02:59.358 --> 01:03:01.438
on the robots will be perceived
as the bigger threat.

1063
01:03:02.661 --> 01:03:04.596
Yeah.

1064
01:03:04.663 --> 01:03:08.367
Medusa is constantly calibrating
its responses to our decisions.

1065
01:03:08.432 --> 01:03:11.170
It knows we're headed here.

1066
01:03:11.235 --> 01:03:12.871
It knows that
we can't hack into it

1067
01:03:12.936 --> 01:03:14.806
from the outside and
it knows that we're armed.

1068
01:03:14.873 --> 01:03:16.785
So it's going to assume
that we'll shoot our way in.

1069
01:03:16.809 --> 01:03:18.410
It'll break ranks.

1070
01:03:18.476 --> 01:03:20.445
And when it does that.
it'll send the most robots

1071
01:03:20.512 --> 01:03:22.313
after whoever
has the most weapons.

1072
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.082
Can't go after
every dog that barks.

1073
01:03:24.148 --> 01:03:26.484
But once it runs
facial recognition on you.

1074
01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:29.387
medusa's gonna ignore
every distraction

1075
01:03:29.454 --> 01:03:31.756
and just send all the drones
straight to you.

1076
01:03:31.822 --> 01:03:33.391
Doesn't matter.

1077
01:03:33.458 --> 01:03:35.260
It'll buy us some time.

1078
01:03:35.327 --> 01:03:37.029
I'll do it.

1079
01:03:37.094 --> 01:03:39.230
I'll be the bait. not Jorge.

1080
01:03:39.297 --> 01:03:40.765
No. no! It should be me!

1081
01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:43.501
The two of you need to get
to Dr. Marietta.

1082
01:03:43.568 --> 01:03:47.072
I got the weapons
to distract it.

1083
01:03:47.139 --> 01:03:48.407
Wow. I...

1084
01:03:48.474 --> 01:03:50.576
Thank me by destroying
these things.

1085
01:03:52.043 --> 01:03:53.878
Okay. we crossed
a bridge back there.

1086
01:03:53.945 --> 01:03:57.549
I'm gonna draw them to it
and use it as a trap.

1087
01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.623
See you guys soon. right?

1088
01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:06.291
Yeah.

1089
01:04:07.159 --> 01:04:08.527
Come on.

1090
01:04:08.592 --> 01:04:10.627
Dr. Marietta is
in a bunker over there.

1091
01:04:10.695 --> 01:04:11.764
Come on.

1092
01:04:18.469 --> 01:04:20.113
Kind of conspicuous for
a hidden underground bunker.

1093
01:04:20.137 --> 01:04:21.574
don't you think?

1094
01:04:21.639 --> 01:04:24.342
That's the logic.
Hide things in plain sight.

1095
01:04:24.409 --> 01:04:26.110
Plus. if people do
go up to it...

1096
01:04:26.177 --> 01:04:27.612
They get in trouble.

1097
01:04:27.679 --> 01:04:30.416
No. It triggers medusa.

1098
01:04:55.773 --> 01:04:58.676
That's zee.
She's still shooting.

1099
01:04:58.744 --> 01:05:00.245
Just focus.

1100
01:05:00.311 --> 01:05:02.313
Wilson!

1101
01:05:03.282 --> 01:05:05.117
Wilson?

1102
01:05:05.182 --> 01:05:07.585
I can't believe it. Wilson.

1103
01:05:07.652 --> 01:05:09.587
And I don't know who you are.

1104
01:05:09.653 --> 01:05:12.157
but you're my favorite
person in the whole world.

1105
01:05:13.858 --> 01:05:15.360
I'm Jorge.

1106
01:05:15.425 --> 01:05:18.230
I used to work with...

1107
01:05:18.297 --> 01:05:20.965
Tara's dead.

1108
01:05:21.032 --> 01:05:22.168
One of the Ares got her.

1109
01:05:23.402 --> 01:05:25.436
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

1110
01:05:25.503 --> 01:05:27.472
Doctor. what do we need to do?

1111
01:05:27.539 --> 01:05:30.275
What's that?

1112
01:05:30.342 --> 01:05:32.277
I think they're trying
to get in!

1113
01:05:32.344 --> 01:05:34.045
They're getting smarter.

1114
01:05:34.112 --> 01:05:35.814
Look. when I locked myself in.

1115
01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.982
I figured I could take
the communications tunnel

1116
01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:39.418
directly to base.

1117
01:05:39.485 --> 01:05:41.019
But there are probably
robots already

1118
01:05:41.085 --> 01:05:42.697
approaching through there.
we'd all be trapped.

1119
01:05:42.721 --> 01:05:44.822
What if we trigger
the emp grenade in here?

1120
01:05:44.889 --> 01:05:46.290
No. no. no.

1121
01:05:46.358 --> 01:05:47.501
The bunker is steel
reinforced. lead-lined.

1122
01:05:47.525 --> 01:05:49.027
It's three feet thick.

1123
01:05:49.094 --> 01:05:50.872
The pulse wouldn't even
kill a phone on the roof.

1124
01:05:50.896 --> 01:05:53.932
But it would surge
through the computer console.

1125
01:05:53.998 --> 01:05:56.467
blow up and likely kill us all.

1126
01:05:56.534 --> 01:05:57.769
Ah!

1127
01:05:59.804 --> 01:06:01.507
But you can
communicate wirelessly?

1128
01:06:01.574 --> 01:06:02.740
Yes. yes.

1129
01:06:02.807 --> 01:06:04.976
There's a central antenna
that runs

1130
01:06:05.043 --> 01:06:06.445
from the console to a patch.

1131
01:06:06.512 --> 01:06:08.580
- And it carries a current?
- Exactly.

1132
01:06:08.646 --> 01:06:10.325
Okay. well. if the pulse
is electromagnetic

1133
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:13.218
then we get a couple of copper
wires and create a solenoid.

1134
01:06:13.284 --> 01:06:14.353
Yes!

1135
01:06:14.418 --> 01:06:16.054
So the pulse we transferred from

1136
01:06:16.121 --> 01:06:18.023
electromagnetic into electric.

1137
01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:19.257
We fry them with electricity.

1138
01:06:19.324 --> 01:06:20.825
It's a Tesla coil!

1139
01:06:20.891 --> 01:06:24.261
But those grenades. they go
off in only a few seconds!

1140
01:06:24.329 --> 01:06:26.198
Not this time.

1141
01:06:26.264 --> 01:06:28.300
I've got a bomb
and I'm gonna recalibrate it

1142
01:06:28.367 --> 01:06:30.536
to its original base function.

1143
01:06:30.601 --> 01:06:32.237
give us enough time
to reach the tunnel.

1144
01:06:32.304 --> 01:06:35.807
But if you turn it on.
won't it trigger more robots?

1145
01:06:37.275 --> 01:06:38.644
The pulse will take them out.

1146
01:06:40.445 --> 01:06:41.956
Jorge. I'm going to need
you to go over there

1147
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:42.914
and grab the antenna wire.

1148
01:06:42.981 --> 01:06:44.416
Marietta?

1149
01:06:44.481 --> 01:06:45.384
Grab the cable and plug
it up to the computer.

1150
01:06:45.451 --> 01:06:47.184
Go. go. go!

1151
01:06:47.251 --> 01:06:48.487
Move quickly. gentleman.

1152
01:06:48.554 --> 01:06:50.856
Come on! Let's go. let's go!

1153
01:06:50.922 --> 01:06:53.200
Right. uh... how much longer
'til medusa fully takes over?

1154
01:06:53.224 --> 01:06:54.559
20 minutes. maybe less.

1155
01:06:54.626 --> 01:06:56.227
There's like a
thousand wires over here!

1156
01:06:56.293 --> 01:06:57.663
Which one do we use?

1157
01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:01.099
Uh. that one! That one!
That one! Come on!

1158
01:07:01.166 --> 01:07:03.001
Go. go. go. go. go!

1159
01:07:03.067 --> 01:07:05.103
Wrap it around!

1160
01:07:05.170 --> 01:07:07.740
Come on. guys!

1161
01:07:07.806 --> 01:07:09.106
- Go. go!
- Go!

1162
01:07:09.173 --> 01:07:11.476
When we get in the tunnel.
I'll open the door!

1163
01:07:23.755 --> 01:07:26.156
We bought some distance
from the robots.

1164
01:07:26.224 --> 01:07:28.059
Not much. but some.

1165
01:07:28.126 --> 01:07:29.928
Are there more on the way?

1166
01:07:29.994 --> 01:07:33.664
The ais already sizing up how
much emp firepower we have.

1167
01:07:33.731 --> 01:07:36.634
It has to keep a radius until
it can figure that out.

1168
01:07:36.701 --> 01:07:39.704
It's probably already
figured that out.

1169
01:07:39.771 --> 01:07:41.707
Our electrical engineers
have installed

1170
01:07:41.773 --> 01:07:43.875
a punch code lock
in the south doors

1171
01:07:43.942 --> 01:07:45.844
to the electrical
distribution room.

1172
01:07:45.909 --> 01:07:49.813
It's an analog lock. a fail-safe
in case of a major power outage.

1173
01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.850
It's also protected by
an electromagnetic shield.

1174
01:07:52.916 --> 01:07:57.255
Your heartbeat can't be
detected once you're in there.

1175
01:07:57.322 --> 01:07:59.458
Once we're inside the building.

1176
01:07:59.525 --> 01:08:01.860
we need to access
the main programming room

1177
01:08:01.927 --> 01:08:03.595
to access medusa.

1178
01:08:03.661 --> 01:08:04.995
I can enter the coding.

1179
01:08:05.063 --> 01:08:07.465
There's a lot
of ground to cover.

1180
01:08:07.532 --> 01:08:09.835
And what if we can't stop it?

1181
01:08:11.735 --> 01:08:14.672
What if we can't stop it?

1182
01:08:14.739 --> 01:08:17.375
The three of us may die trying.

1183
01:08:17.442 --> 01:08:19.644
But if we stop medusa.
the world lives.

1184
01:08:19.711 --> 01:08:23.115
If we don't.
if we do something wrong.

1185
01:08:23.181 --> 01:08:26.550
medusa lives and the world dies.

1186
01:08:26.618 --> 01:08:28.954
Either way.
there's no turning back.

1187
01:08:31.488 --> 01:08:32.924
Let's finish this.

1188
01:08:35.927 --> 01:08:38.729
We're gonna pass
three security cameras.

1189
01:08:38.796 --> 01:08:41.399
Once we pass the first one.
it's gonna trigger an alarm

1190
01:08:41.466 --> 01:08:43.835
and medusa will send
the robots to stop us.

1191
01:08:43.902 --> 01:08:46.136
If we can enter into
the program room fast enough.

1192
01:08:46.203 --> 01:08:49.807
then we could shut the
steel door and get to work.

1193
01:08:49.875 --> 01:08:51.385
And hope that Ares
doesn't break through

1194
01:08:51.409 --> 01:08:52.778
before you finish the hack?

1195
01:08:55.113 --> 01:08:58.150
I'll hit it with a powerful
kill-all switch and distract it.

1196
01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:02.121
What's that?

1197
01:09:03.255 --> 01:09:05.123
Um. dog tags.

1198
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:08.960
Red dragon and her
cousin Derek gave us.

1199
01:09:09.027 --> 01:09:13.832
Tara was wearing them
when we were attacked.

1200
01:09:16.467 --> 01:09:17.603
Wait.

1201
01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:22.474
I need some time
to enter the sysconfig

1202
01:09:22.541 --> 01:09:26.144
and turn off the analog motors

1203
01:09:26.211 --> 01:09:27.846
and switch the capacheats.

1204
01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:37.422
The programming
center's just ahead.

1205
01:09:37.488 --> 01:09:38.989
Look. if the Ares robots
start firing.

1206
01:09:39.056 --> 01:09:41.925
you shield Wilson.
but don't stop firing back!

1207
01:09:41.993 --> 01:09:43.762
Now wait here!

1208
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:46.330
<i>Access denied.</i>

1209
01:09:46.398 --> 01:09:47.766
It's denying my security access.

1210
01:09:47.832 --> 01:09:49.635
Shut it off manually!

1211
01:09:49.701 --> 01:09:51.978
We'll have to get into the wall.
but we don't have the tools!

1212
01:09:52.002 --> 01:09:53.171
Oh. I got this!

1213
01:09:57.842 --> 01:09:58.842
Hurry!

1214
01:09:58.877 --> 01:10:00.746
Which one trips the shut-off?

1215
01:10:00.811 --> 01:10:01.947
I'll cut them all!

1216
01:10:04.681 --> 01:10:06.117
<i>Access granted.</i>

1217
01:10:07.217 --> 01:10:08.653
Let's go.

1218
01:10:10.555 --> 01:10:12.824
<i>Closing shield doors.</i>

1219
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:14.701
All right. there's a large
port on the back of the console.

1220
01:10:14.725 --> 01:10:16.693
You can access medusa
directly from there.

1221
01:10:16.761 --> 01:10:17.896
Right. right. right!

1222
01:10:19.463 --> 01:10:21.166
What is that?

1223
01:10:23.234 --> 01:10:26.103
That's the nfx.
a rescue robot Dr. Lopez.

1224
01:10:26.171 --> 01:10:28.974
Dr. Marietta and I were working
on to help rescue people.

1225
01:10:29.039 --> 01:10:30.542
It was designed to pull people

1226
01:10:30.609 --> 01:10:32.186
from collapsed buildings
in disaster areas.

1227
01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:34.645
We pulled it offline once
medusa malfunctioned.

1228
01:10:37.681 --> 01:10:38.617
You hear that?

1229
01:10:38.682 --> 01:10:40.551
<i>Access granted.</i>

1230
01:10:40.618 --> 01:10:42.520
The door!

1231
01:10:47.091 --> 01:10:48.126
Ah!

1232
01:10:55.634 --> 01:11:00.872
Wilson. you cannot stop this.

1233
01:11:00.939 --> 01:11:02.774
Jorge!

1234
01:11:02.841 --> 01:11:04.676
Ah!

1235
01:11:04.743 --> 01:11:07.512
Jorge! Jorge! Jorge! No. no. no!

1236
01:11:07.578 --> 01:11:08.512
Jorge! Jorge!

1237
01:11:08.579 --> 01:11:09.514
Help him!

1238
01:11:09.581 --> 01:11:10.515
Jorge. come on. man!

1239
01:11:10.582 --> 01:11:11.817
Come on. wake up. Jorge!

1240
01:11:11.882 --> 01:11:13.093
- Jorge?
- Keep the pressure on it!

1241
01:11:13.117 --> 01:11:14.552
- Keep the pressure on!
- Jorge!

1242
01:11:14.618 --> 01:11:17.021
Jorge. come on. can you hear me?
Jorge!

1243
01:11:17.087 --> 01:11:20.291
Medusa is about to take over
the world's military weapons!

1244
01:11:20.358 --> 01:11:22.202
Doctor. doctor. hand me the
tablet! Hand me the tablet!

1245
01:11:22.226 --> 01:11:23.360
Here. here. here.

1246
01:11:23.427 --> 01:11:24.863
- All right.
- Come on!

1247
01:11:24.929 --> 01:11:27.632
That was Tara's dad's
quantum tablet.

1248
01:11:27.698 --> 01:11:29.634
But once you start
entering the code.

1249
01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:31.012
it's going to start
trying to hack

1250
01:11:31.036 --> 01:11:33.570
the quantum firewall
on that tablet.

1251
01:11:33.637 --> 01:11:35.405
- Oh...
- Hang in there. buddy.

1252
01:11:35.472 --> 01:11:38.309
The kill-all virus will take a
few seconds for it to stop it.

1253
01:11:38.376 --> 01:11:42.713
But that'll give me just enough
time to enter in the data bomb.

1254
01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:43.981
Medusa's system will shut down

1255
01:11:44.048 --> 01:11:45.649
and stop its systems
from frying.

1256
01:11:45.716 --> 01:11:48.351
But that'll give me
enough time to go at it.

1257
01:11:48.418 --> 01:11:50.188
Hurry...

1258
01:11:55.859 --> 01:11:58.596
<i>Medusa has entered standby mode.</i>

1259
01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.109
Is it...

1260
01:12:12.176 --> 01:12:14.313
No. not yet.

1261
01:12:14.378 --> 01:12:16.247
It wouldn't work that fast.

1262
01:12:18.082 --> 01:12:19.683
We were seconds away from medusa

1263
01:12:19.751 --> 01:12:22.119
taking over
the world's nuclear arsenal.

1264
01:12:23.188 --> 01:12:24.590
Hey...

1265
01:12:26.023 --> 01:12:28.293
- Hey.
- Oh. welcome back.

1266
01:12:30.795 --> 01:12:32.663
Oh. man. dude.

1267
01:12:32.729 --> 01:12:34.431
They shot this at you.

1268
01:12:34.498 --> 01:12:36.667
- Really?
- Yeah.

1269
01:12:38.536 --> 01:12:40.505
Why is it still blinking?

1270
01:12:40.572 --> 01:12:42.106
What?

1271
01:12:42.173 --> 01:12:43.207
Let me see that.

1272
01:12:45.109 --> 01:12:46.277
Doctor?

1273
01:12:48.646 --> 01:12:51.382
Medusa transferred
her ai into this...

1274
01:12:57.121 --> 01:12:58.288
Oh!

1275
01:12:58.355 --> 01:12:59.366
Come on. come on. come on!

1276
01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:00.792
Come on!

1277
01:13:49.974 --> 01:13:51.710
Why isn't it dead?

1278
01:13:51.775 --> 01:13:53.253
Medusa transferred
itself to another system!

1279
01:13:53.277 --> 01:13:55.980
- What system?
- It's just gone!

1280
01:13:56.046 --> 01:13:58.315
Look. the kill-all virus
should have slowed it down.

1281
01:13:58.381 --> 01:14:03.454
But medusa transmitted itself
to a different mainframe.

1282
01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:06.157
That shouldn't be
possible unless it...

1283
01:14:06.224 --> 01:14:08.059
Unless it...

1284
01:14:08.126 --> 01:14:09.860
It changed itself
once it deployed.

1285
01:14:09.927 --> 01:14:12.730
Oh. man. that means it wouldn't
have slowed it down at all.

1286
01:14:12.797 --> 01:14:15.899
So your virus didn't
kill it at all?

1287
01:14:15.966 --> 01:14:18.502
It turned into
a modular firewall.

1288
01:14:18.569 --> 01:14:20.470
It didn't slow it down.

1289
01:14:20.537 --> 01:14:21.706
I helped it escape.

1290
01:14:29.581 --> 01:14:31.315
I need help.

1291
01:14:31.381 --> 01:14:32.660
Come on. come on.
we're taking you outside.

1292
01:14:32.684 --> 01:14:34.085
No. no.

1293
01:14:34.152 --> 01:14:35.762
Just set me down in front
of the computer here.

1294
01:14:35.786 --> 01:14:37.389
- Be more use here.
- All right.

1295
01:14:42.761 --> 01:14:43.961
So what's the plan?

1296
01:14:44.028 --> 01:14:46.364
Medusa is not going anywhere.

1297
01:14:47.899 --> 01:14:49.467
And what makes you think that?

1298
01:14:49.533 --> 01:14:51.368
Because she still wants us dead.

1299
01:14:53.337 --> 01:14:56.674
There's only so much tech
with a sliding base

1300
01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:00.144
parallel to her qbit shell.

1301
01:15:00.211 --> 01:15:03.748
It has to be hiding
in the machine at spaceport.

1302
01:15:04.682 --> 01:15:05.615
I'll find it.

1303
01:15:05.682 --> 01:15:06.984
No.

1304
01:15:07.051 --> 01:15:07.986
You click one
button on that computer.

1305
01:15:08.051 --> 01:15:10.688
medusa will find you.

1306
01:15:10.755 --> 01:15:12.490
Stay here. I'll look.

1307
01:15:12.556 --> 01:15:14.101
Reinforce the door
and turn your radio on

1308
01:15:14.125 --> 01:15:15.993
just in case I need you
to go online.

1309
01:15:18.762 --> 01:15:19.965
I'm coming with you.

1310
01:15:49.261 --> 01:15:50.362
Found it.

1311
01:15:54.865 --> 01:15:56.868
Medusa's in that?

1312
01:15:56.935 --> 01:15:58.302
That?

1313
01:15:58.368 --> 01:15:59.368
Yep.

1314
01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:03.842
Run!

1315
01:16:13.885 --> 01:16:15.019
We need to split up!

1316
01:16:15.086 --> 01:16:16.421
No. we need a plan!

1317
01:16:18.855 --> 01:16:20.190
I have a plan!

1318
01:16:20.256 --> 01:16:22.460
All right. turn on your radio!

1319
01:16:22.525 --> 01:16:24.161
All right.

1320
01:16:24.228 --> 01:16:26.764
All right. listen for my orders
and get the Ares to follow you!

1321
01:16:26.831 --> 01:16:28.365
- Okay?
- Got it.

1322
01:16:46.684 --> 01:16:48.220
Ah!

1323
01:17:00.297 --> 01:17:02.434
Dr. Marietta! Dr. Marietta!

1324
01:17:04.702 --> 01:17:06.904
All right. I'm here.

1325
01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:08.738
Medusa is in
the nfx rescue robot!

1326
01:17:08.805 --> 01:17:12.476
You said you'd get here and map
a mainframe to help me.

1327
01:17:12.543 --> 01:17:14.412
Well. now's your chance!

1328
01:17:14.479 --> 01:17:16.614
Lead me to medusa's new brain.

1329
01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.215
All right. mapping now.

1330
01:17:20.518 --> 01:17:21.618
Have you found it yet?

1331
01:17:21.685 --> 01:17:23.420
Have you found it yet?
Do a heat scan.

1332
01:17:23.487 --> 01:17:26.024
see where most
of the heat is generating.

1333
01:17:27.524 --> 01:17:30.094
All right. the
mainframe is located

1334
01:17:30.161 --> 01:17:32.463
in the chest cavity
of the robot.

1335
01:17:35.065 --> 01:17:36.967
I knew it!

1336
01:17:37.034 --> 01:17:38.202
What?

1337
01:17:39.304 --> 01:17:42.407
Wilson! Wilson!

1338
01:17:43.475 --> 01:17:44.942
Jorge?

1339
01:17:45.009 --> 01:17:46.211
Jorge. can you hear me?

1340
01:17:50.047 --> 01:17:51.448
Oh...

1341
01:17:56.287 --> 01:17:57.689
Ah!

1342
01:18:02.393 --> 01:18:03.395
Wilson?

1343
01:18:05.496 --> 01:18:06.297
Wilson?

1344
01:18:06.363 --> 01:18:08.231
<i>Jorge. are you okay?</i>

1345
01:18:08.298 --> 01:18:10.134
<i>Yeah. I'll live.</i>

1346
01:18:10.201 --> 01:18:12.112
Are you in an area where you
can make a lot of noise?

1347
01:18:12.136 --> 01:18:14.339
<i>Uh. yeah. I think so.</i>

1348
01:18:14.404 --> 01:18:17.708
I need you to lure
the Ares robots away.

1349
01:18:17.775 --> 01:18:18.975
Can you do that?

1350
01:18:19.042 --> 01:18:21.211
<i>Yes. Yeah. I can do that.</i>

1351
01:18:21.279 --> 01:18:23.014
<i>Hey! Hey. robots. I'm down here!</i>

1352
01:18:23.079 --> 01:18:25.283
<i>Come and get me!</i>

1353
01:18:51.176 --> 01:18:52.576
I'm in!

1354
01:18:52.643 --> 01:18:54.779
<i>Good. Where's you friend. Jorge?</i>

1355
01:18:54.845 --> 01:18:56.314
Hopefully safe.

1356
01:18:58.882 --> 01:19:00.951
Robots! Hey!

1357
01:19:01.018 --> 01:19:02.153
Wilson!

1358
01:19:03.755 --> 01:19:05.422
Oh. no.

1359
01:19:09.761 --> 01:19:11.730
How far are you?

1360
01:19:12.796 --> 01:19:14.030
Close. I hope!

1361
01:19:14.097 --> 01:19:15.932
What are you trying to do?

1362
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.600
This thing's got a brain.

1363
01:19:17.667 --> 01:19:19.702
Well. I'm about to
give it a heart.

1364
01:19:19.770 --> 01:19:21.973
What. make it nicer?

1365
01:19:22.038 --> 01:19:23.774
No. Make it a target.

1366
01:19:26.210 --> 01:19:28.413
What's that?

1367
01:19:28.479 --> 01:19:30.781
We are running out of time here.

1368
01:19:38.588 --> 01:19:40.158
I'm here!

1369
01:19:46.264 --> 01:19:49.300
I'm in front of the motherboard
and I'm prying it open!

1370
01:19:49.367 --> 01:19:51.201
All right. once you pull
that processor.

1371
01:19:51.268 --> 01:19:52.604
we can hack it directly.

1372
01:19:56.306 --> 01:19:57.675
<i>All right. it's out!</i>

1373
01:19:57.742 --> 01:20:00.744
Wilson. it knows
you're inside the robot.

1374
01:20:00.811 --> 01:20:03.213
<i>Medusa is launching
nukes across the globe.</i>

1375
01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.048
<i>It's now or never.</i>

1376
01:20:05.115 --> 01:20:08.019
<i>Yeah. well. now it's going to
have my heartbeat inside of it!</i>

1377
01:20:08.085 --> 01:20:11.387
<i>And every robot within firing
distance is going to detect it</i>

1378
01:20:11.454 --> 01:20:13.091
<i>and shred this thing!</i>

1379
01:20:14.591 --> 01:20:16.960
<i>I've got it!
It's coming from the intercom!</i>

1380
01:20:17.028 --> 01:20:19.030
<i>It's feeding into the system
as an algorithm!</i>

1381
01:20:19.095 --> 01:20:21.465
All right. Climb inside
the steel reinforced casing

1382
01:20:21.532 --> 01:20:22.734
and hurry!

1383
01:20:48.493 --> 01:20:50.762
Medusa is transmitting
your heartbeat

1384
01:20:50.828 --> 01:20:52.630
to every robot in the world.

1385
01:20:52.697 --> 01:20:55.565
<i>The robots think it's
a living human being now!</i>

1386
01:20:55.631 --> 01:20:58.735
<i>It'll use every robot
to attack itself!</i>

1387
01:20:58.802 --> 01:21:02.873
<i>It's working. Wilson. but
you're still inside the target.</i>

1388
01:21:02.939 --> 01:21:04.141
<i>Brace yourself.</i>

1389
01:21:29.832 --> 01:21:30.934
<i>Come in. Wilson.</i>

1390
01:21:31.002 --> 01:21:32.403
<i>Wilson? Are you okay?</i>

1391
01:21:37.007 --> 01:21:38.809
I'm on my way.

1392
01:22:36.199 --> 01:22:37.668
A little help here. guys?

1393
01:22:39.603 --> 01:22:42.472
Zee! Oh. my god!
You're both alive!

1394
01:22:43.774 --> 01:22:44.976
Barely.

1395
01:22:48.378 --> 01:22:50.881
That was just...

1396
01:22:50.948 --> 01:22:53.618
Well...

1397
01:22:53.685 --> 01:22:54.953
Yeah.

1398
01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:58.656
Yeah. yeah.

1399
01:23:00.724 --> 01:23:03.595
I'm proud of you. You did it!

1400
01:23:03.661 --> 01:23:07.364
I always told you.
you're all heart.

1401
01:23:09.867 --> 01:23:11.703
So what do we do now?

1402
01:23:15.671 --> 01:23:17.674
There's a lot of work to do.

1403
01:23:20.344 --> 01:23:21.779
Where do we start?

1404
01:23:24.448 --> 01:23:25.649
Just log in.

1405
01:23:27.018 --> 01:23:28.353
Just log in.
