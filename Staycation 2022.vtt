3
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.582
- This can't be our
opening argument.

4
00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:02.975
They will throw us
out of the court.

5
00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.499
- I disagree.

6
00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:06.892
It's unorthodox. but
it is very strong.

7
00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:09.504
- Yeah. but there's no
evidence to support this.

8
00:01:09.547 --> 00:01:11.375
I mean if we go with this
type of accusation our client

9
00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:13.508
could lose millions.

10
00:01:24.345 --> 00:01:26.434
- Come on. Toya. they
owe at a minimum.

11
00:01:26.477 --> 00:01:29.524
$2 million in unpaid wages.

12
00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:32.004
- Well. you and I both know
it's not about what you know.

13
00:01:32.048 --> 00:01:34.616
but what you can prove.

14
00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:35.791
- Yeah. yeah.

15
00:01:46.628 --> 00:01:48.586
- I am just so tired.

16
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.156
I just want a hot bath and
I just wanna go to sleep.

17
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.507
- Mm. I really want
a bottle of red wine.

18
00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:59.206
- Oh. that
sounds so nice.

19
00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:02.470
- And then you can
take a bath after that.

20
00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:03.601
Then get into bed.

21
00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:05.037
- Yes.

22
00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:06.343
- It's been a long day.

23
00:02:06.387 --> 00:02:07.475
- A long week.

24
00:02:07.518 --> 00:02:08.650
- Yeah.

25
00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:27.712
- You know what?

26
00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:35.503
- Ah!

27
00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:37.548
Yo!

28
00:02:38.984 --> 00:02:40.638
- Yo!

29
00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:42.858
- What's the matter?

30
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:45.034
- She did it again. bro.

31
00:02:45.077 --> 00:02:46.601
- Who did what again?

32
00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:48.733
- Dawn did it again.

33
00:02:48.777 --> 00:02:50.213
- What'd she do?

34
00:02:50.257 --> 00:02:52.955
- Hey. she missed
our anniversary. bro.

35
00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:54.348
- Again?

36
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:55.610
- You remember?

37
00:02:55.653 --> 00:02:57.525
It's the seventh year in a row.

38
00:02:57.568 --> 00:02:59.788
- Oh. that's right.

39
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:01.485
When she was out celebrating
with some girlfriends

40
00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:02.269
or something like that.

41
00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:03.226
Right?

42
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.358
- She had just won some big case

43
00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:05.663
or something like that. man.

44
00:03:05.707 --> 00:03:07.448
So she went out with
her girls to celebrate.

45
00:03:07.491 --> 00:03:09.798
on our anniversary mind you.

46
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:11.713
She got pissy drunk. bro.

47
00:03:11.756 --> 00:03:13.715
- That's right. That's right.

48
00:03:13.758 --> 00:03:15.064
She didn't come home
til the next day

49
00:03:15.107 --> 00:03:18.589
'cause she was passed
out at Latoya's crib.

50
00:03:27.032 --> 00:03:30.775
- Oh. look. that's her
trying to call me right now.

51
00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:31.994
- Well aren't you gonna answer?

52
00:03:32.037 --> 00:03:33.691
- Hell no. for what?

53
00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:34.736
- That's your wife. man.

54
00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:35.824
It could be important.

55
00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:37.086
- Okay.

56
00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.306
So what's more important
than my anniversary?

57
00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.350
- Touche. bro.

58
00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:41.873
All right. you got a point.

59
00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:43.223
- Besides I'm gonna let her
worry for a little while.

60
00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:45.007
She be all right.

61
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.706
- Well I don't think
that's a good idea. bro.

62
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.447
Fine. All right. then.

63
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:52.275
So what you gonna do about it?

64
00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.711
- Man. I don't know.

65
00:03:53.755 --> 00:03:55.539
I aint thought about
it that far yet.

66
00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:57.237
- Well you better
figure something out.

67
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.848
You know that sorta thing
ain't gonna just fix itself.

68
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:01.371
- Yeah. all right.

69
00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:02.851
Hey. you busy?

70
00:04:02.894 --> 00:04:04.809
I'm gonna come to your
crib for a few minutes.

71
00:04:04.853 --> 00:04:06.898
- All right. come on. Pull up.

72
00:04:06.942 --> 00:04:07.899
- All right. bro.

73
00:04:07.943 --> 00:04:09.814
- All right.
- All right.

74
00:04:24.916 --> 00:04:27.136
- I forgot our anniversary.

75
00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:28.485
Kyle made us dinner.

76
00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:29.312
- Dawn!

77
00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:33.273
Listen. I got this.

78
00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:34.665
You go home.

79
00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:35.927
- Are you sure?

80
00:04:35.971 --> 00:04:38.713
- Yeah.
I'm sure. Go. girl.

81
00:04:42.194 --> 00:04:43.848
- Good luck.

82
00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.086
- I called you.

83
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.087
- Yeah. I saw.

84
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.873
- Why didn't you answer?

85
00:05:51.916 --> 00:05:53.396
- Why didn't you answer?

86
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.658
- Because I was working.

87
00:05:54.702 --> 00:05:56.007
- Hmm. figures.

88
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:58.967
Seems the only thing that
you care about around here.

89
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.883
- Yes. I do care about my job.

90
00:06:01.926 --> 00:06:04.451
I'm sorry that
bothers you so much.

91
00:06:04.494 --> 00:06:08.280
But us grownups. we like
things like stability.

92
00:06:08.324 --> 00:06:10.761
Can't just sit around
playing make-believe.

93
00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:12.850
writing comics all day.

94
00:06:12.894 --> 00:06:14.809
Real adults work. Kyle.

95
00:06:16.463 --> 00:06:20.075
- First of all. I get up
every morning just like you do

96
00:06:20.118 --> 00:06:22.599
and I go to a damn job
that I can't stand.

97
00:06:22.643 --> 00:06:23.905
- Hmm.

98
00:06:23.948 --> 00:06:25.297
- And speaking of
adults. real adults

99
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:27.865
don't forget their anniversary.

100
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.999
Real adults don't leave a. "I'm
sorry." message on the food

101
00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:33.915
that they husband
prepared for 'em.

102
00:06:38.876 --> 00:06:39.747
- Where were you?

103
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:40.661
- Does it even matter?

104
00:06:40.704 --> 00:06:43.228
- Just answer the damn question.

105
00:06:45.013 --> 00:06:47.363
- I was at Brandon's house.

106
00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:50.018
- Hmm.

107
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:51.323
- I was.

108
00:06:51.367 --> 00:06:53.238
Why don't you call him
and see for yourself?

109
00:06:53.282 --> 00:06:54.544
- Sure.

110
00:06:54.588 --> 00:06:56.154
- When you didn't show
up for our anniversary

111
00:06:56.198 --> 00:06:57.547
I went over there to cool off
so I wouldn't say something

112
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:00.724
that I didn't mean and
possibly regret later on.

113
00:07:01.812 --> 00:07:03.074
I was not with another woman.

114
00:07:03.118 --> 00:07:05.816
I know that's what you
think. but I was not.

115
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.515
- Oh. don't act like it
would be the first time.

116
00:07:10.038 --> 00:07:13.258
- That was two years ago. Dawn.

117
00:07:13.302 --> 00:07:15.783
When you gone let that shit go?

118
00:07:17.088 --> 00:07:21.179
How long are you gonna keep
throwing that in my face?

119
00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:25.140
Enjoy your wine.

120
00:07:26.141 --> 00:07:27.490
I'm going to bed.

121
00:07:27.534 --> 00:07:28.839
- Yeah. I will.

122
00:09:54.855 --> 00:09:56.378
- What's good. bro?

123
00:09:56.421 --> 00:09:57.640
I just came to check on you.

124
00:09:57.684 --> 00:09:58.902
I know last night
was a bit rough.

125
00:09:58.946 --> 00:09:59.990
- Boy.
- Straight?

126
00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:01.688
- Bro. she went off.

127
00:10:04.516 --> 00:10:06.214
"And where were you at?"

128
00:10:06.257 --> 00:10:07.302
- What'd you tell her?

129
00:10:07.345 --> 00:10:08.433
- That I was with you.

130
00:10:08.477 --> 00:10:09.260
- She believe you?

131
00:10:09.304 --> 00:10:10.392
- Probably not.

132
00:10:10.435 --> 00:10:11.741
- Ah. bro.

133
00:10:11.785 --> 00:10:13.134
That's not good.

134
00:10:13.177 --> 00:10:14.265
- Nah. it's not. man.

135
00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:20.794
Kyle Robinson's office.

136
00:10:25.842 --> 00:10:26.626
Yes. sir.

137
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.673
Yes. sir.

138
00:10:30.717 --> 00:10:33.676
Okay. be there in a minute.

139
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.025
- Who was that?

140
00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:37.506
- That was your boss. Mr. Eric.

141
00:10:37.549 --> 00:10:39.464
"Kyle. I need to see you
in my office right away

142
00:10:39.508 --> 00:10:41.292
about the Cartwright project."

143
00:10:41.336 --> 00:10:42.076
- All right. man.

144
00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:43.773
We still on for lunch?

145
00:10:43.817 --> 00:10:44.774
- No.

146
00:10:44.818 --> 00:10:46.341
So I've got a meeting with Dawn

147
00:10:46.384 --> 00:10:48.430
and Dr. Shelton today for lunch.

148
00:10:48.473 --> 00:10:51.694
- All right. well wanna
link up at the gym later?

149
00:10:51.738 --> 00:10:52.956
- Now that's a bet.

150
00:10:54.523 --> 00:10:55.524
- Holla at ya player.

151
00:10:55.567 --> 00:10:56.699
- Appreciate you. bro.

152
00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:13.673
- Oh. hey. what's up bro?

153
00:11:13.716 --> 00:11:14.586
- Nothing.

154
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.327
You said you needed to see me.

155
00:11:16.371 --> 00:11:17.633
- Oh. yeah. yeah.

156
00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:20.157
So I am going out of
town for two weeks

157
00:11:20.201 --> 00:11:22.812
and I am gonna need you
to take care of my part

158
00:11:22.856 --> 00:11:24.727
in the Cartwright
project while I'm gone.

159
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:26.033
You can take care of
that for me. right?

160
00:11:26.076 --> 00:11:28.165
- Erm. I'm confused.

161
00:11:28.209 --> 00:11:31.038
Why you can't do your own part?

162
00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:33.083
- Because. bro. there's
no way I'm gonna be able

163
00:11:33.127 --> 00:11:37.261
to do my work and enjoy
my trip at the same time.

164
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.742
Come on.

165
00:11:39.786 --> 00:11:40.656
Just be a team player. huh?

166
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.658
Pick up my slack.

167
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.704
- I ain't gonna
be able to do it.

168
00:11:44.747 --> 00:11:45.487
- You're joking. right?

169
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.097
- No. sir.

170
00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:50.753
If I do your part then I can't
do my best work on my part.

171
00:11:50.797 --> 00:11:52.668
And it's supposed to be
a team project. right?

172
00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.757
So you have to
find somebody else.

173
00:11:54.801 --> 00:11:57.412
- Yeah. but you see.
there is no one else.

174
00:11:57.455 --> 00:11:59.762
You're the best we got.

175
00:11:59.806 --> 00:12:01.764
You can take on a
little extra. right?

176
00:12:01.808 --> 00:12:02.809
- Yes. sir. I can.

177
00:12:02.852 --> 00:12:03.635
- Okay. cool.

178
00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:04.593
So it's settled.

179
00:12:04.636 --> 00:12:07.683
- Yeah. but I'm not gonna do it.

180
00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.077
- Look. Kyle. it's this simple.

181
00:12:11.426 --> 00:12:15.430
Either you do the work.
or you find another job.

182
00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:19.739
- You piece of shit.

183
00:12:21.349 --> 00:12:24.787
- So you're gonna do it. right?

184
00:12:24.831 --> 00:12:25.919
- Yes. of course.

185
00:12:25.962 --> 00:12:27.747
We will have that
all taken care of.

186
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.880
Yes. there is no possible
way for us to lose.

187
00:12:33.056 --> 00:12:36.712
Hey. Dr. Hawthorne. I
have actually an issue

188
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.758
that I need to take care of.

189
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:40.977
Is it possible for us
to discuss this further

190
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:42.370
later on today?

191
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:44.589
Okay.

192
00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:45.373
Yes. sir.

193
00:12:45.416 --> 00:12:46.853
I will talk to you then.

194
00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:47.941
Okay. bye.

195
00:12:54.861 --> 00:12:57.820
Hi. good morning.
this is Dawn Robinson.

196
00:12:57.864 --> 00:13:00.083
I am calling to
reschedule my appointment

197
00:13:00.127 --> 00:13:01.998
with Dr. Shelton today.

198
00:13:03.608 --> 00:13:06.002
Oh. he said I can't reschedule?

199
00:13:08.178 --> 00:13:11.268
How did he know that
I was gonna call?

200
00:13:13.053 --> 00:13:13.836
Okay.

201
00:13:15.882 --> 00:13:19.799
But I just. I really
can't come today.

202
00:13:19.842 --> 00:13:21.322
Okay.

203
00:13:21.365 --> 00:13:24.978
All right. well tell Dr.
Shelton I'll be there at two.

204
00:13:25.021 --> 00:13:26.066
Okay. Thanks.

205
00:13:26.109 --> 00:13:26.849
Bye.

206
00:13:26.893 --> 00:13:28.459
- You ready?

207
00:13:28.503 --> 00:13:29.765
- For what?

208
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:30.853
- Strategy meeting.
It's starting now.

209
00:13:30.897 --> 00:13:32.594
Come one.
- I guess.

210
00:13:35.902 --> 00:13:37.077
I just got caught
up with everything.

211
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.904
- Okay.

212
00:13:39.862 --> 00:13:41.995
So how did it go last night?

213
00:13:43.213 --> 00:13:44.867
- He came home around one.

214
00:13:44.911 --> 00:13:46.477
We had a fight.

215
00:13:46.521 --> 00:13:49.872
He slept in the guest room
and I drank a bottle of wine.

216
00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:51.874
- Well where was
he all that time?

217
00:13:51.918 --> 00:13:52.875
- He said he was at Brandon's.

218
00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:54.877
- Do you believe him?

219
00:13:54.921 --> 00:13:56.096
- I don't know.

220
00:13:56.139 --> 00:13:57.880
He seemed genuine.
but he's lied before.

221
00:13:57.924 --> 00:13:58.663
So...

222
00:13:58.707 --> 00:14:00.230
- So what are you gonna?

223
00:14:00.274 --> 00:14:01.449
- Nothing.

224
00:14:01.492 --> 00:14:03.059
I have too much going
on here to worry

225
00:14:03.103 --> 00:14:04.495
about what's going on at home.

226
00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:06.976
- D. this isn't
gonna fix itself.

227
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.108
- I know that.

228
00:14:08.151 --> 00:14:09.413
Just...

229
00:14:09.457 --> 00:14:12.155
I'm not ready to focus
on that right now.

230
00:14:12.199 --> 00:14:13.940
- All right. whatever
you wanna do.

231
00:14:13.983 --> 00:14:15.028
Come on.

232
00:14:24.646 --> 00:14:28.084
- Okay. now that everyone's
here let's get started.

233
00:14:28.128 --> 00:14:30.130
You guys know we like to
start our meetings off

234
00:14:30.173 --> 00:14:31.522
with positive energy.

235
00:14:31.566 --> 00:14:33.873
Let's see. who
wants to go first?

236
00:14:33.916 --> 00:14:35.396
- Well. I signed my first

237
00:14:35.439 --> 00:14:38.268
multimillion dollar
settlement yesterday.

238
00:14:38.312 --> 00:14:41.402
- I heard about that.
- Congratulations!

239
00:14:41.445 --> 00:14:44.535
- We are in a great place
with the Hawthorne case.

240
00:14:44.579 --> 00:14:47.103
Dawn and I have a
strong opening argument

241
00:14:47.147 --> 00:14:51.107
that we believe is going to
secure a decision in our favor.

242
00:14:51.151 --> 00:14:52.065
- Oh. really?

243
00:14:52.108 --> 00:14:53.109
- Yes!
- All right.

244
00:14:53.153 --> 00:14:54.371
- That's great news.

245
00:14:54.415 --> 00:14:57.418
Great news. I can't
wait to hear it.

246
00:14:57.461 --> 00:15:00.769
- Well yesterday my
husband and I celebrated

247
00:15:00.812 --> 00:15:02.510
our anniversary.

248
00:15:02.553 --> 00:15:04.773
- Yeah.
- That's wonderful.

249
00:15:04.816 --> 00:15:06.035
congratulations.
- Yeah.

250
00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:08.211
- I hope you guys didn't
spend too much time here

251
00:15:08.255 --> 00:15:09.821
last night prepping?

252
00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:12.215
I saw you and Latoya
burning the midnight oil.

253
00:15:12.259 --> 00:15:13.738
- Not at all. sir.

254
00:15:13.782 --> 00:15:15.175
She wouldn't have missed it
for anything in the world.

255
00:15:15.218 --> 00:15:19.266
- Finally. Lauren.
anything you have to share?

256
00:15:20.441 --> 00:15:23.574
- I just found out
that I'm pregnant.

257
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:26.012
- Oh. congratulations.
- Congratulations.

258
00:15:26.055 --> 00:15:29.102
- Congratulations.
- That's wonderful.

259
00:15:29.145 --> 00:15:30.799
- How far along are you?

260
00:15:30.842 --> 00:15:31.974
- Well
I'm only six weeks.

261
00:15:32.018 --> 00:15:34.324
but we're really excited.

262
00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:35.760
- Well. that's great.

263
00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:38.676
Okay. everybody. let's
get down to business.

264
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.039
- So how was your anniversary?

265
00:15:53.082 --> 00:15:54.997
- Well are you talking
about the day in general

266
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:57.086
or just the evening part?

267
00:15:59.306 --> 00:16:00.568
- How are you really
playing this game?

268
00:16:00.611 --> 00:16:02.700
You know exactly what I mean.

269
00:16:02.744 --> 00:16:06.313
Look. my office is not
your courtroom. Dawn.

270
00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:09.229
Kyle?

271
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.233
- She missed it again.

272
00:16:13.276 --> 00:16:14.277
- Dawn?

273
00:16:14.321 --> 00:16:15.496
- I had to work.

274
00:16:15.539 --> 00:16:16.845
- What
could be more important

275
00:16:16.888 --> 00:16:19.761
than celebrating the
single most important day

276
00:16:19.804 --> 00:16:21.154
between a husband and wife?

277
00:16:21.197 --> 00:16:22.851
- I'm work-
- A day that only comes

278
00:16:22.894 --> 00:16:24.461
around once a year.

279
00:16:24.505 --> 00:16:29.162
A day that. according to you.
you were looking forward to.

280
00:16:30.641 --> 00:16:33.731
- Well when you put it
like that I guess my reason

281
00:16:33.775 --> 00:16:37.474
wasn't as strong of an
argument as I thought.

282
00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:42.653
- So. Kyle. how does Dawn
missing your anniversary

283
00:16:43.611 --> 00:16:44.829
make you feel?

284
00:16:47.049 --> 00:16:49.399
- Like she don't even
care about me anymore.

285
00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:51.271
Like I'm not important
to her at all.

286
00:16:51.314 --> 00:16:52.185
- Here we go.

287
00:16:52.228 --> 00:16:53.838
- See what I'm saying?

288
00:16:53.882 --> 00:16:55.840
See. it's like you don't even
care about me anymore. Dawn.

289
00:16:55.884 --> 00:16:58.278
- Oh. let's not talk
about people caring.

290
00:16:58.321 --> 00:17:01.107
Did you care about me when
you slept with that thot?

291
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.456
- Are you serious right now?

292
00:17:02.499 --> 00:17:03.848
- Yes. I'm dead serious.

293
00:17:03.892 --> 00:17:05.502
- This is irrelevant to
what we're doing here

294
00:17:05.546 --> 00:17:06.460
right now. Dawn.

295
00:17:06.503 --> 00:17:08.331
- It's absolutely relevant.

296
00:17:08.375 --> 00:17:09.854
That's why we're here.

297
00:17:09.898 --> 00:17:11.247
- Why do you keep
throwing that in my face?

298
00:17:11.291 --> 00:17:13.989
Why you staying with me
if you gonna keep going

299
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:15.469
back and forth over
what I did in the past?

300
00:17:15.512 --> 00:17:16.774
- All right. stop.

301
00:17:16.818 --> 00:17:18.907
Can we just stop?

302
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.780
Okay. now we've moved
into an area where hurting

303
00:17:22.824 --> 00:17:26.828
each other's feelings
with words is commonplace.

304
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.745
I have an assignment for you.

305
00:17:30.788 --> 00:17:35.184
Now. unfortunately. this
will be the last assignment

306
00:17:35.228 --> 00:17:37.839
with you as my patients.

307
00:17:37.882 --> 00:17:42.539
It seems that you need
something that I can't assist

308
00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:45.107
you with here in this office.

309
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:50.156
- What's the assignment. doc?

310
00:17:51.548 --> 00:17:54.508
- I'm sending you
all on a staycation.

311
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.380
- A staycation?

312
00:17:57.424 --> 00:17:58.555
- A staycation.

313
00:17:58.599 --> 00:17:59.643
- I can't do that.

314
00:17:59.687 --> 00:18:00.992
I have to work.

315
00:18:01.036 --> 00:18:02.690
- You see
what I'm saying?

316
00:18:02.733 --> 00:18:04.561
- I'm in the middle of
one of the biggest cases

317
00:18:04.605 --> 00:18:05.867
in my career.

318
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.435
I can't just up and go
on a vacation with you.

319
00:18:08.478 --> 00:18:09.697
- A staycation.

320
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.221
- A staycation. whatever
it is. I can't do it.

321
00:18:12.265 --> 00:18:14.223
I have to work.

322
00:18:14.267 --> 00:18:16.921
- But. Dawn. you're going
to have to make a decision

323
00:18:16.965 --> 00:18:18.271
on what's best.

324
00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:25.234
Either you wanna save your
marriage or you don't.

325
00:18:25.278 --> 00:18:26.583
It's up to you.

326
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.730
- A staycation?

327
00:18:42.773 --> 00:18:43.948
What's that?

328
00:18:43.992 --> 00:18:44.514
Some type of new
vacation or something?

329
00:18:44.558 --> 00:18:46.081
- Nah. man.

330
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.430
It's when you go on a vacation
with whoever. wherever.

331
00:18:47.474 --> 00:18:49.084
you just gotta stay
in your own city.

332
00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.520
- So what it's like a vacation

333
00:18:50.564 --> 00:18:53.654
for people who can't
afford a real one?

334
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:02.184
- It's whatever you
want it to be. bro.

335
00:19:02.228 --> 00:19:03.620
- So why they choose y'all?

336
00:19:03.664 --> 00:19:04.839
- Because. he told
me he wanna find out

337
00:19:04.882 --> 00:19:07.363
if me and Dawn wanna
stay married or not.

338
00:19:07.407 --> 00:19:08.451
- Rules?

339
00:19:08.495 --> 00:19:09.974
What kind of rules?

340
00:19:10.018 --> 00:19:12.455
- We both can't leave the
house for any reason at all.

341
00:19:12.499 --> 00:19:13.717
- Not even
to go get food.

342
00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:15.023
- No.

343
00:19:15.066 --> 00:19:17.504
And we both get a day to
plan three activities.

344
00:19:17.547 --> 00:19:19.419
ones that the other likes to do.

345
00:19:19.462 --> 00:19:21.377
- Well. how many
days are y'all there?

346
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:22.378
- Three.

347
00:19:22.422 --> 00:19:23.205
- Three days?

348
00:19:23.249 --> 00:19:24.467
- Yeah.

349
00:19:24.511 --> 00:19:25.903
- What y'all gonna do
for three straight days?

350
00:19:25.947 --> 00:19:27.340
I know what I'd be doing
with three straight days.

351
00:19:27.383 --> 00:19:28.167
- Go. man.

352
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.255
- Come on. bro.

353
00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:30.212
My bad.

354
00:19:30.256 --> 00:19:32.606
I forgot you were in a drought.

355
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.264
- 19-13.

356
00:19:40.483 --> 00:19:42.746
Man. look. every night
when we finish we gotta put

357
00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.096
ourselves on tape send
it back to Dr. Shelton.

358
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.837
- What. so y'all some kind
of case study or something?

359
00:19:46.881 --> 00:19:50.537
You know. this kinda sound
like the Stanford Experiment.

360
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.842
- Man. you talking about the one

361
00:19:51.886 --> 00:19:53.757
when that professor
had that basement?

362
00:19:53.801 --> 00:19:55.019
- Yeah!
- That jail in the basement?

363
00:19:55.063 --> 00:19:58.066
- Yeah. them boys
went crazy down there.

364
00:20:00.373 --> 00:20:01.504
Come on. bro.

365
00:20:02.766 --> 00:20:04.812
- Well how do you
know if it works?

366
00:20:04.855 --> 00:20:06.857
- Well at the end
we get to decide

367
00:20:06.901 --> 00:20:09.077
if we wanna stay
together or not.

368
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:09.904
- Damn.

369
00:20:11.514 --> 00:20:12.776
- 19-14.

370
00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.995
- I don't care.

371
00:20:14.038 --> 00:20:15.779
I quit my job because
I hated it. bro.

372
00:20:15.823 --> 00:20:17.346
- Well at least you
got time to focus

373
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:18.782
on what you want now. huh?

374
00:20:18.826 --> 00:20:19.609
On your own stuff.

375
00:20:19.653 --> 00:20:20.393
- Yeah.

376
00:20:20.436 --> 00:20:21.220
Focus on me.

377
00:20:21.263 --> 00:20:22.003
- Uh-huh.

378
00:20:22.046 --> 00:20:22.830
- Yeah.

379
00:20:24.048 --> 00:20:26.399
- That's a lot to
decide in three days.

380
00:20:26.442 --> 00:20:27.269
- Yeah.

381
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.013
- So. you think it's gonna work?

382
00:20:32.056 --> 00:20:34.624
- I'm just trying not
to think about it.

383
00:20:34.668 --> 00:20:36.147
- Okay. listen.

384
00:20:36.191 --> 00:20:38.324
Let's start thinking
about what you wanna do.

385
00:20:38.367 --> 00:20:39.760
Okay. so what are
your activities?

386
00:20:39.803 --> 00:20:40.630
Let me help you with this.

387
00:20:40.674 --> 00:20:41.631
- Okay.

388
00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:42.850
Ax throwing.

389
00:20:42.893 --> 00:20:44.068
- Huh?

390
00:20:44.112 --> 00:20:45.722
- Knivery.

391
00:20:45.766 --> 00:20:46.506
Boxing.

392
00:20:47.724 --> 00:20:49.683
- You know from
where I'm standing.

393
00:20:49.726 --> 00:20:51.989
if you don't get a
steady paycheck coming in

394
00:20:52.033 --> 00:20:55.297
Dawn aint gonna be
fooled for too long.

395
00:21:05.873 --> 00:21:06.917
- Come on. bro.

396
00:21:09.398 --> 00:21:10.225
Oh. man.

397
00:21:11.922 --> 00:21:14.751
I aint walking to you to get it.

398
00:21:21.192 --> 00:21:23.412
- Can I ask you a question?

399
00:21:23.456 --> 00:21:24.283
- Sure.

400
00:21:27.024 --> 00:21:30.550
- Do you really think
this is gonna work?

401
00:21:32.726 --> 00:21:34.728
- I honestly don't know.

402
00:21:37.818 --> 00:21:41.952
- Well for what it's worth.
I'm glad you chose me

403
00:21:43.911 --> 00:21:45.129
over your job.

404
00:21:49.612 --> 00:21:53.050
- Well. I wasn't given
much of a choice.

405
00:22:00.101 --> 00:22:01.058
- Guess not.

406
00:22:04.018 --> 00:22:05.236
Shit.

407
00:22:45.102 --> 00:22:45.886
- Wow.

408
00:22:47.322 --> 00:22:49.150
- This is nice.

409
00:22:49.193 --> 00:22:50.020
- Yeah.

410
00:22:51.195 --> 00:22:52.936
- Might not be so bad after all.

411
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.981
Hm?

412
00:22:54.024 --> 00:22:54.808
- Hmm.

413
00:23:09.649 --> 00:23:11.564
- So who's going first?

414
00:23:11.607 --> 00:23:12.521
- For what?

415
00:23:14.088 --> 00:23:16.046
- We gotta do our videos.

416
00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.398
- Oh. I totally
forgot about that.

417
00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:22.444
I am not looking
forward to doing those.

418
00:23:22.488 --> 00:23:23.314
- Why not?

419
00:23:24.533 --> 00:23:27.144
- Because it's weird
talking to a camera.

420
00:23:27.188 --> 00:23:28.711
It's not natural.

421
00:23:30.278 --> 00:23:32.019
- Yeah. I get that.

422
00:23:34.108 --> 00:23:35.544
I'll go first.

423
00:23:35.588 --> 00:23:36.458
- Okay.

424
00:23:36.502 --> 00:23:38.068
I'll go after you.

425
00:23:38.112 --> 00:23:39.113
- Yeah.

426
00:23:39.156 --> 00:23:40.114
- Yeah.

427
00:23:54.215 --> 00:23:55.259
- Okay.

428
00:23:56.913 --> 00:23:59.133
Hey. Dr. Shelton. it's me.

429
00:23:59.176 --> 00:24:03.224
We're here. but I guess
you know that already.

430
00:24:06.227 --> 00:24:07.620
I really don't know
what I'm doing.

431
00:24:07.663 --> 00:24:08.838
This is weird.

432
00:24:10.144 --> 00:24:12.233
But the house is amazing.

433
00:24:14.365 --> 00:24:16.150
Beautiful view.

434
00:24:16.193 --> 00:24:17.238
It looks nice.

435
00:24:17.281 --> 00:24:19.849
Which is. that's
good I guess. huh?

436
00:24:21.285 --> 00:24:22.809
But I am concerned.

437
00:24:24.332 --> 00:24:28.336
Doc. I don't know if Dawn is
here because she wants to try

438
00:24:28.379 --> 00:24:31.644
to make it work with me or
if she's just here to say

439
00:24:31.687 --> 00:24:34.298
she tried it and it didn't work.

440
00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:41.654
Yeah. I guess we just gonna
have to find out. huh?

441
00:24:41.697 --> 00:24:43.699
So talk to you tomorrow.

442
00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:48.269
I'm out.

443
00:24:59.802 --> 00:25:01.195
I've finished.

444
00:25:01.238 --> 00:25:02.936
- Well. how was it?

445
00:25:04.328 --> 00:25:05.373
- Awkward.

446
00:25:07.244 --> 00:25:08.376
- Yeah?

447
00:25:08.419 --> 00:25:09.420
- I guess I'll get
a little bit better

448
00:25:09.464 --> 00:25:11.422
with it as I go along. you know?

449
00:25:11.466 --> 00:25:12.598
- I don't know.

450
00:25:12.641 --> 00:25:15.035
I guess I'll have to
try and let you know

451
00:25:15.078 --> 00:25:16.515
how it goes or something.

452
00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:17.341
- Yeah.

453
00:25:29.745 --> 00:25:33.575
- I'm gonna take the
guest bedroom tonight.

454
00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:35.577
You can have the master.

455
00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:37.623
- Okay.

456
00:25:38.624 --> 00:25:39.363
- Yeah?

457
00:25:39.407 --> 00:25:40.451
- Yeah.

458
00:25:42.889 --> 00:25:44.412
- Night.

459
00:25:44.455 --> 00:25:45.326
- Good night.

460
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.561
- Okay. well I'm not
really sure how to do this.

461
00:26:06.129 --> 00:26:10.612
I guess I don't really know
what to expect this weekend.

462
00:26:12.875 --> 00:26:16.009
Guess I'm gonna have
no expectations.

463
00:26:20.404 --> 00:26:25.061
I really don't know. I guess
we'll just see what happens.

464
00:27:36.872 --> 00:27:37.656
Mm.

465
00:27:40.136 --> 00:27:40.920
- Morning.

466
00:27:42.008 --> 00:27:42.878
- Morning.

467
00:27:42.922 --> 00:27:44.663
It smells good.

468
00:27:44.706 --> 00:27:46.577
- Well it should.
it's your favorite.

469
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:48.231
It's French toast.

470
00:27:49.058 --> 00:27:50.581
- It looks amazing.

471
00:27:51.844 --> 00:27:53.715
- How'd you sleep?

472
00:27:53.759 --> 00:27:55.282
- Mm. okay.

473
00:27:55.325 --> 00:27:56.196
You?

474
00:27:56.239 --> 00:27:57.632
- I didn't.

475
00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:59.025
- Really?

476
00:27:59.068 --> 00:28:02.028
I mean looks like you
have all kinds of energy.

477
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:04.421
Up early cooking breakfast.

478
00:28:07.773 --> 00:28:11.385
- That's because I had
a revelation last night.

479
00:28:11.428 --> 00:28:13.256
- A revelation?

480
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.083
- Yeah.

481
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.740
You and I. babe we got a
chance to course correct.

482
00:28:18.784 --> 00:28:20.394
You know?

483
00:28:20.437 --> 00:28:21.874
Make everything
right between us.

484
00:28:21.917 --> 00:28:23.745
So I'm gonna seize it.

485
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:26.182
I'm gonna make the most of it.

486
00:28:28.837 --> 00:28:30.143
What you think?

487
00:28:33.059 --> 00:28:35.670
- I just think I'm...

488
00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:37.672
Think I just wanna let it flow.

489
00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:38.673
You know. I don't
really wanna put

490
00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:41.284
too many expectations on it.

491
00:28:41.328 --> 00:28:42.285
I kind of feel like
we could be setting

492
00:28:42.329 --> 00:28:44.461
ourselves up for failure.

493
00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:47.116
- Okay. makes sense.

494
00:28:48.465 --> 00:28:49.466
Makes sense.

495
00:28:55.995 --> 00:28:57.779
I'm gonna go get that.

496
00:29:02.436 --> 00:29:03.742
- What's up. man?

497
00:29:03.785 --> 00:29:06.788
I'm John and this is
Jessie and we are...

498
00:29:12.968 --> 00:29:13.752
- That was good. babe.

499
00:29:13.795 --> 00:29:14.970
- Thank you. honey.

500
00:29:15.014 --> 00:29:17.668
- We're here for your
sexercise session.

501
00:29:17.712 --> 00:29:18.757
- Sexercise?

502
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.888
- Yes. sir.

503
00:29:19.932 --> 00:29:21.063
It's a name that I
have trademarked.

504
00:29:21.107 --> 00:29:23.979
We mix exercise
with sexual movement

505
00:29:26.329 --> 00:29:30.899
to help you to attain
extraordinary sexual levels.

506
00:29:30.943 --> 00:29:32.727
- That's right.

507
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:34.598
We're gonna give
y'all everything you
need to be healthy

508
00:29:34.642 --> 00:29:38.080
and happy while you work up a
good sweat between the sheets.

509
00:29:38.124 --> 00:29:40.039
- Mm-hmm.
- And in the shower.

510
00:29:40.082 --> 00:29:42.737
- Mm-hmm.
- On the kitchen table.

511
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:44.043
- Mm-hmm.
Or wherever-

512
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:51.354
- So are you ready for the
best and greatest experience

513
00:29:51.398 --> 00:29:53.356
you have ever had in your life?

514
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.970
So I can show you all. wherever
you decide to sexercise.

515
00:30:01.016 --> 00:30:02.844
- Why don't y'all come on in?

516
00:30:02.888 --> 00:30:03.627
- Okay.

517
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:04.933
Come on. let's go.

518
00:30:04.977 --> 00:30:06.065
Thank you. Thank you.

519
00:30:06.108 --> 00:30:06.892
Thanks.

520
00:30:12.201 --> 00:30:13.942
- Erm. bae.

521
00:30:13.986 --> 00:30:14.943
- Hm?

522
00:30:14.987 --> 00:30:16.031
- This...

523
00:30:17.946 --> 00:30:20.862
So I know how much you
love to work out. right?

524
00:30:20.906 --> 00:30:23.430
So this is John and Jessie.

525
00:30:23.473 --> 00:30:26.433
They are personal trainers.

526
00:30:26.476 --> 00:30:30.045
They're here to give
us a sexercise session.

527
00:30:31.917 --> 00:30:32.874
- Sexercise?

528
00:30:34.484 --> 00:30:35.877
What's that?

529
00:30:35.921 --> 00:30:37.400
- Good morning.

530
00:30:37.444 --> 00:30:40.708
Like he said. I'm John and
this is Jessie and we are...

531
00:30:57.943 --> 00:30:58.682
- That was beautiful. babe.

532
00:30:58.726 --> 00:30:59.901
- Oh. thanks. baby.

533
00:30:59.945 --> 00:31:00.728
You know I've been
working on it all week.

534
00:31:00.771 --> 00:31:02.295
- I can tell.

535
00:31:02.338 --> 00:31:03.078
- Oh. thank you.

536
00:31:03.122 --> 00:31:03.905
You know what?

537
00:31:03.949 --> 00:31:05.211
You are so supportive.

538
00:31:05.254 --> 00:31:06.908
This is why I love you.

539
00:31:06.952 --> 00:31:07.909
You know what?

540
00:31:07.953 --> 00:31:08.779

Don't play around with it.

00:32:24.725 --> 00:32:25.682
- And you straddle
it on it like this.

583
00:32:25.726 --> 00:32:26.466
- Oh. like this.

584
00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:27.249
- Like that.

585
00:32:27.293 --> 00:32:28.120
- Yes.

586
00:32:28.163 --> 00:32:29.469
- You see that?
- Uh-huh.

587
00:32:29.512 --> 00:32:30.992
- Now see what that does
is it clears the pathway

588
00:32:31.036 --> 00:32:34.213
for you to land your airplane
on this landing strip.

589
00:32:34.256 --> 00:32:35.257
You hear me?

590
00:32:35.301 --> 00:32:36.084
You ever been bowling?

591
00:32:36.128 --> 00:32:37.390
- Yeah.

592
00:32:37.433 --> 00:32:38.304
- Yeah. you know how
they got the lane?

593
00:32:38.347 --> 00:32:39.218
- Yeah.

594
00:32:39.261 --> 00:32:40.523
- You know how you hit a strike?

595
00:32:40.567 --> 00:32:41.872
Ball go down the lane.

596
00:32:41.916 --> 00:32:43.091
- Oh. yeah. yeah.

597
00:32:43.135 --> 00:32:44.266
So then you gotta stretch out.

598
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.180
you gotta stretch out good.

599
00:32:45.224 --> 00:32:46.225
Look. look like this.

600
00:32:47.052 --> 00:32:48.488
You lean forward in it.

601
00:32:48.531 --> 00:32:49.271
Make sure you get a good
stretch and then you come back.

602
00:32:49.315 --> 00:32:50.316
Did you stretch it?

603
00:32:50.359 --> 00:32:51.099
- Yes.

604
00:32:51.143 --> 00:32:51.926
- Mm-hmm. Do it again.

605
00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:52.796

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:57.932
You get that?
- Mm-hmm.

610
00:32:57.976 --> 00:32:58.977
- Yeah. good stretch.

611
00:32:59.020 --> 00:32:59.934

Yeah. lean in again.

00:33:01.675 --> 00:33:02.632
Yes. yes.

615
00:33:02.676 --> 00:33:04.025
Like that there.

616
00:33:04.069 --> 00:33:05.287
Talk to her baby.
tell her what to do.

617
00:33:05.331 --> 00:33:07.289
- Okay. Dawn. now you
wanna encourage him

618
00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:08.247
for the stretching.

619
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:10.292
So you just say what I say.

620
00:33:10.336 --> 00:33:13.252
Oh. baby. you
stretch me so good.

621
00:33:13.295 --> 00:33:14.601
- Oh. yeah. baby.

622
00:33:15.776 --> 00:33:18.518

00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:27.048
- I can't wait for
you to bend me over

628
00:33:27.092 --> 00:33:28.789
and stretch from behind.

629
00:33:28.832 --> 00:33:30.095
Oh.

630
00:33:30.138 --> 00:33:30.921
- Say that.

631
00:33:30.965 --> 00:33:31.705
Say that.

632
00:33:31.748 --> 00:33:33.402
- Oh. baby. I can't...

633
00:33:33.446 --> 00:33:34.751
You feel so good.

634
00:33:35.926 --> 00:33:37.972

00:33:38.016 --> 00:33:39.408
and stretch me from behind.

636
00:33:39.452 --> 00:33:41.149

00:33:41.193 --> 00:33:42.411
Now just rub his head.

638
00:33:42.455 --> 00:33:43.238

Ooh. yeah.

00:34:05.086 --> 00:34:06.522
I'm gonna stretch

655
00:34:06.566 --> 00:34:07.697
Yeah. I'm gonna stretch
it all the way out.

656
00:34:07.741 --> 00:34:08.698

662
00:34:16.358 --> 00:34:18.360
- Don't you stop. Don't stop.
- I'm not gonna.

663
00:34:18.404 --> 00:34:19.448
I'm coming. baby.
- Almost there. baby.

664
00:34:19.492 --> 00:34:20.362
- I aint stopping.
- Almost there.

665
00:34:20.406 --> 00:34:21.363
Oh. yeah.
- Yeah.

666
00:34:24.018 --> 00:34:24.888
- Oh. yeah!

667
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:27.413
Oh. yeah.

668
00:34:36.378 --> 00:34:39.338
- Ready to stretch
the other leg?

669
00:34:40.643 --> 00:34:42.297
- So we hope y'all enjoyed
your sexercise session.

670
00:34:42.341 --> 00:34:43.472
We've really enjoyed you all.

671
00:34:43.516 --> 00:34:45.126
We really enjoyed it. right?

672
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:46.040
- We really enjoyed it. yeah.

673
00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:47.520
- We take all forms of payment.

674
00:34:47.563 --> 00:34:49.565
Cash App. Venmo-

675
00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:50.479
- Yes.

676
00:35:06.713 --> 00:35:08.062
- Yeah. stupid.

677
00:35:12.197 --> 00:35:13.589
That was fast.

678
00:35:13.633 --> 00:35:16.766
- Yeah. well I didn't
really have much to say.

679
00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:19.029
- I know that was awkward.

680
00:35:20.683 --> 00:35:23.599
You know. can't really find
the words to explain it.

681
00:35:23.643 --> 00:35:25.906
- Yeah. I know what you mean.

682
00:35:27.429 --> 00:35:28.474
So what's next?

683
00:35:29.866 --> 00:35:32.565
And hopefully it's not X-rated.

684
00:35:34.567 --> 00:35:36.569
- No. it's not.

685
00:35:36.612 --> 00:35:39.572
It's actually something you
said you always wanted to do

686
00:35:39.615 --> 00:35:42.357
but never had time to do it.

687
00:35:42.401 --> 00:35:44.359
- What's that?

688
00:35:44.403 --> 00:35:47.623
- It's not time for
that yet though.

689
00:35:47.667 --> 00:35:48.711
- So you got something
else planned?

690
00:35:48.755 --> 00:35:49.538
- Mm.

691
00:35:53.412 --> 00:35:54.935
Not yet.

692
00:35:54.978 --> 00:35:56.197
Come with me.

693
00:36:08.078 --> 00:36:09.863
We've got a few hours
before our next activity

694
00:36:09.906 --> 00:36:12.866
so I think you
should enjoy this.

695
00:36:25.966 --> 00:36:27.489
- I think I will.

696
00:36:28.403 --> 00:36:29.970
- Good.

697
00:36:30.013 --> 00:36:31.711
I'll see you in a
couple of hours.

698
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.262
- Hey.

699
00:37:01.306 --> 00:37:02.045
- Hey.

700
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:03.264
- What are you doing?

701
00:37:03.308 --> 00:37:05.658
- Oh. I'm just putting
something away.

702
00:37:05.701 --> 00:37:07.312
How was your bath?

703
00:37:07.355 --> 00:37:09.009
- Oh. it was good.

704
00:37:09.052 --> 00:37:10.532
Yeah.

705
00:37:10.576 --> 00:37:12.230
I haven't felt this relaxed
in a really long time.

706
00:37:12.273 --> 00:37:13.448
- Good.

707
00:37:13.492 --> 00:37:14.928
You've been going really
hard at work lately

708
00:37:14.971 --> 00:37:17.800
so I figured you needed
something to help you relax.

709
00:37:17.844 --> 00:37:20.586
- You've always been
very thoughtful.

710
00:37:20.629 --> 00:37:23.284
I guess some things
don't change.

711
00:37:24.807 --> 00:37:25.765
- I guess not.

712
00:37:29.812 --> 00:37:31.553
Let me go get that.

713
00:37:35.905 --> 00:37:37.167
Hello.

714
00:37:37.211 --> 00:37:38.821
- Hi.

715
00:37:38.865 --> 00:37:40.214
Kyle. right?

716
00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:41.650
- You must be Lola?

717
00:37:41.694 --> 00:37:42.695
- Yes. I am.

718
00:37:43.957 --> 00:37:47.134
And maybe you should
be the fortune teller.

719
00:37:47.177 --> 00:37:47.961
- Dawn?

720
00:37:49.049 --> 00:37:50.746
Hey. this is Lola.

721
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.270
She's a palm reader.

722
00:37:52.313 --> 00:37:54.837
- Oh my God. I've always
wanted my palm read.

723
00:37:54.881 --> 00:37:56.970
I can't believe you remembered.

724
00:37:57.013 --> 00:37:58.363
- Come on. I always remember

725
00:37:58.406 --> 00:38:01.540
the things that are
important to me.

726
00:38:01.583 --> 00:38:03.324
- Hi. I'm Dawn.

727
00:38:03.368 --> 00:38:05.108
Very nice to meet you.

728
00:38:05.152 --> 00:38:07.981
- Oh. it's nice to meet you too.

729
00:38:08.982 --> 00:38:10.375
- Come on. let's go
to the dining room.

730
00:38:10.418 --> 00:38:11.550
- Oh. thank you.

731
00:38:11.593 --> 00:38:12.594
- After you.

732
00:38:29.872 --> 00:38:30.873
- Who'd like to go first?

733
00:38:30.917 --> 00:38:31.961
- Me.

734
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:38.141
- Let me have your
dominant hand please.

735
00:38:38.185 --> 00:38:40.796
Ooh. and the energy is strong.

736
00:38:50.197 --> 00:38:51.198
- What?

737
00:38:51.241 --> 00:38:52.373
What is it?

738
00:38:52.417 --> 00:38:53.766
What do you see?

739
00:38:53.809 --> 00:38:54.854
- Erm. pain.

740
00:38:57.987 --> 00:39:00.990
A great deal of
pain from your past.

741
00:39:03.036 --> 00:39:05.517
There is a crack in your heart.

742
00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.650
It's been broken.

743
00:39:10.217 --> 00:39:12.045
Look. right here.

744
00:39:12.088 --> 00:39:16.528
Your heart line is separated
and the only way to repair

745
00:39:17.964 --> 00:39:20.358
this is through forgiveness.

746
00:39:21.968 --> 00:39:23.099
Understand?

747
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:26.233
- Mm-hmm.

748
00:39:30.933 --> 00:39:33.022
- No. I don't think I
wanna give you mine now.

749
00:39:33.066 --> 00:39:34.110
- Come on.

750
00:39:34.154 --> 00:39:35.285
I won't hurt.

751
00:39:36.896 --> 00:39:40.116
Ooh. you guys have
such strong energy.

752
00:39:42.554 --> 00:39:43.903
Mm.

753
00:39:43.946 --> 00:39:45.165
- What?

754
00:39:46.862 --> 00:39:48.255
- I see confusion.

755
00:39:50.126 --> 00:39:51.258
- Me?

756
00:39:51.301 --> 00:39:52.781
About what?

757
00:39:52.825 --> 00:39:53.608
- Life.

758
00:39:55.915 --> 00:39:59.397
See you are torn between
something you love

759
00:40:03.792 --> 00:40:05.794
and something you value.

760
00:40:08.275 --> 00:40:11.017
The possibility of
change has been presented

761
00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.629
but you need to grab
it before it's too late

762
00:40:16.501 --> 00:40:18.981
and before it's gone forever.

763
00:40:21.244 --> 00:40:24.900
You also need to be more
honest with yourself

764
00:40:26.902 --> 00:40:29.383
and with the others around you.

765
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:35.084
They can handle it. if you
give them the opportunity.

766
00:40:38.218 --> 00:40:41.569
You've made a lot of
mistakes in your life

767
00:40:43.136 --> 00:40:47.053
but I'm here to tell you.
trust is a two way door.

768
00:40:47.096 --> 00:40:48.881
It swings both ways.

769
00:40:50.796 --> 00:40:51.666
Understand?

770
00:40:52.667 --> 00:40:54.016
- Yes. ma'am.

771
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:54.800
- Good.

772
00:40:57.585 --> 00:40:59.195
Give me your hand.

773
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:01.110
Ooh. gosh.

774
00:41:03.199 --> 00:41:07.029
Look. I want to tell
you both something.

775
00:41:07.073 --> 00:41:09.336
I saw something in both of you.

776
00:41:09.379 --> 00:41:11.469
Okay? So listen carefully.

777
00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:16.996
You both have these
fortified defenses up

778
00:41:19.215 --> 00:41:22.175
and they're just so strong

779
00:41:22.218 --> 00:41:24.220
that they're not only
keeping everybody else out

780
00:41:24.264 --> 00:41:27.397
but you two cannot
get to each other.

781
00:41:29.182 --> 00:41:34.187
I need you to let them down and
embrace who you have become.

782
00:41:35.928 --> 00:41:37.190
Okay?

783
00:41:37.233 --> 00:41:39.497
It's the only way
to move forward.

784
00:41:40.759 --> 00:41:41.673
Understand?

785
00:41:42.587 --> 00:41:43.675
- Yes. ma'am.

786
00:41:43.718 --> 00:41:44.502
- Good.

787
00:41:48.549 --> 00:41:50.725
- Let me get that for you.

788
00:41:52.292 --> 00:41:53.423
Question.

789
00:41:53.467 --> 00:41:54.990
- Yeah.

790
00:41:55.034 --> 00:41:58.994
- Did you really see all of
that that you said you saw?

791
00:41:59.038 --> 00:42:02.215
- If I didn't. would
you have paid me?

792
00:42:03.129 --> 00:42:03.869
- I guess not.

793
00:42:03.912 --> 00:42:04.652
- Well...

794
00:42:06.262 --> 00:42:10.876
Let me give you some free
advice. tell her the truth.

795
00:42:11.398 --> 00:42:12.181
How about that?

796
00:42:12.225 --> 00:42:13.356
It always works.

797
00:42:14.662 --> 00:42:16.490
- I'll see myself out.

798
00:42:18.057 --> 00:42:19.580
I'm only a call away.

799
00:42:19.624 --> 00:42:20.450
- Okay.

800
00:42:26.413 --> 00:42:30.548
- So I don't really know
how to feel right now.

801
00:42:33.202 --> 00:42:37.424
She knew things that I
haven't shared with anyone.

802
00:42:37.467 --> 00:42:39.469
Just thoughts. feelings.

803
00:42:41.907 --> 00:42:43.822
Do I have walls up?

804
00:42:43.865 --> 00:42:45.432
Yes. Sure.

805
00:42:45.475 --> 00:42:49.479
I mean a lot of stuff has
happened and I like my walls.

806
00:42:50.437 --> 00:42:52.570
they make me feel safe.

807
00:42:54.267 --> 00:42:58.184
So I don't know if I'm
ready to let those down.

808
00:43:03.537 --> 00:43:04.582
I don't know.

809
00:43:19.031 --> 00:43:23.383
- I know I need to tell
Dawn about quitting my job.

810
00:43:24.645 --> 00:43:27.605
I'm not oblivious of what
that's gonna do to our

811
00:43:27.648 --> 00:43:32.610
relationship but a part of me
is like why should I tell her?

812
00:43:33.915 --> 00:43:35.221
She don't even know if she
wanna stay with me right now

813
00:43:35.264 --> 00:43:38.093
so why open myself up to
an unnecessary argument?

814
00:43:38.137 --> 00:43:38.920
You know?

815
00:45:10.055 --> 00:45:11.665
- You are crazy.

816
00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:15.451
"Inception" is by far one
of the best films ever made.

817
00:45:15.495 --> 00:45:17.149
- So a dream within a dream?

818
00:45:17.192 --> 00:45:19.151
- No. it's not just a
dream within a dream

819
00:45:19.194 --> 00:45:22.763
but it's the idea that
you can create a dream

820
00:45:22.807 --> 00:45:25.810
within someone else's
head and make them believe

821
00:45:25.853 --> 00:45:28.029
that it's their own dream.

822
00:45:28.073 --> 00:45:29.204
That's crazy.

823
00:45:30.466 --> 00:45:31.816
- I'm out done.

824
00:45:31.859 --> 00:45:34.296
I cannot believe you
enjoyed the movie that much.

825
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:37.125
- Yeah. well I like some
of the stuff you taught

826
00:45:37.169 --> 00:45:38.605
me about sci-fi.

827
00:45:40.433 --> 00:45:41.173
Oh my God.

828
00:45:41.216 --> 00:45:42.827
- What?

829
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:45.481
- I just can't believe
how big of a nerd I am.

830
00:45:45.525 --> 00:45:46.787
- You are not a nerd.

831
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:49.224
- Yes I am. and I
blame you for it.

832
00:45:49.268 --> 00:45:50.530
- Okay.

833
00:45:50.573 --> 00:45:51.444
I'm not gonna take
the blame for that.

834
00:45:51.487 --> 00:45:53.359
- Well I blame you.

835
00:45:53.402 --> 00:45:58.059
- If you wanna blame me for
something. blame me for this.

836
00:46:02.847 --> 00:46:04.326
That still your favorite song?

837
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:05.719
- It is.

838
00:46:11.856 --> 00:46:16.730
- Babe. would it be too much
if I asked you for a dance?

839
00:46:20.908 --> 00:46:22.127
- Maybe.

840
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:22.954
- Yeah.

841
00:46:24.825 --> 00:46:26.653
- But ask me anyway.

842
00:46:30.178 --> 00:46:32.964
- Will you dance with me?

843
00:46:33.007 --> 00:46:33.791
- Yes.

844
00:47:00.992 --> 00:47:02.428
- Don't you need some more wine?

845
00:47:02.471 --> 00:47:03.690
I'm gonna-
- No. no. no. no.

846
00:47:03.733 --> 00:47:04.430
- I'm just gonna
get some more wine.

847
00:47:04.473 --> 00:47:05.213
I'll be right back.

848
00:47:05.257 --> 00:47:05.953
- No. no. no. Babe?

849
00:47:05.997 --> 00:47:08.521
Babe? Where you going?

850
00:47:08.564 --> 00:47:09.565
- Oh my God.

851
00:47:10.958 --> 00:47:13.091
Am I really doing
this right now?

852
00:47:13.134 --> 00:47:15.789
I mean he is my husband. so...

853
00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:16.877
But he cheated.

854
00:47:33.285 --> 00:47:34.982
- Wow. that took
you a long time.

855
00:47:35.026 --> 00:47:38.725
You crush them grapes with
them pretty feet of yours?

856
00:47:38.768 --> 00:47:40.770
- Did you hide my phone
in the kitchen drawer?

857
00:47:40.814 --> 00:47:41.902
- What are
you talking about?

858
00:47:41.946 --> 00:47:43.338
- Look. don't play with me.

859
00:47:43.382 --> 00:47:46.951
Did you hide my phone
in the kitchen drawer?

860
00:47:46.994 --> 00:47:47.952
- Yeah. I did.

861
00:47:49.475 --> 00:47:50.998
- Damn it.

862
00:47:51.042 --> 00:47:54.915
Kyle. just as I was about
to let my guard down.

863
00:47:54.959 --> 00:47:56.134
I can't believe you.

864
00:47:56.177 --> 00:47:59.441
I had four missed
calls from my boss.

865
00:47:59.485 --> 00:48:02.053
I could have got fired.

866
00:48:02.096 --> 00:48:03.576
You are so selfish.

867
00:48:05.186 --> 00:48:05.926
- Selfish?

868
00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:07.101
- Yes.

869
00:48:07.145 --> 00:48:07.797
- You're calling me selfish?

870
00:48:07.841 --> 00:48:08.668
- Yes. I am.

871
00:48:08.711 --> 00:48:09.930
- Okay.

872
00:48:09.974 --> 00:48:11.453
So yes. I did hide your
phone in the drawer

873
00:48:11.497 --> 00:48:13.978
because if I didn't we wouldn't
have had the conversation

874
00:48:14.021 --> 00:48:16.241
we had. or this time
that we had. Dawn.

875
00:48:16.284 --> 00:48:17.677
I mean you're so
caught up in your job.

876
00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.027
you're always texting.
you're always calling.

877
00:48:20.071 --> 00:48:21.072
You never focus on me.

878
00:48:21.115 --> 00:48:23.639
You only concentrate
on your job.

879
00:48:23.683 --> 00:48:25.685
- It's my job. Kyle.

880
00:48:25.728 --> 00:48:27.208
It's my career.

881
00:48:27.252 --> 00:48:28.993
Hey. just because
you hate your career

882
00:48:29.036 --> 00:48:30.951
doesn't mean I
have to hate mine.

883
00:48:30.995 --> 00:48:31.778
I have goals.

884
00:48:31.821 --> 00:48:33.040
I have ambitions.

885
00:48:33.084 --> 00:48:34.781
And the only way I'm
gonna get those things

886
00:48:34.824 --> 00:48:36.435
is if I work for them.

887
00:48:36.478 --> 00:48:37.784
Which you wouldn't understand

888
00:48:37.827 --> 00:48:39.960
because all you do
is dream all day.

889
00:48:40.004 --> 00:48:40.830
- Wow.

890
00:48:42.223 --> 00:48:43.572
Thanks for supporting me. bae.

891
00:48:43.616 --> 00:48:44.356
Appreciate it.

892
00:48:44.399 --> 00:48:45.139
- Oh. yeah. support.

893
00:48:45.183 --> 00:48:46.401
Support what?

894
00:48:46.445 --> 00:48:49.317
All you do is draw
all day in your room.

895
00:48:49.361 --> 00:48:53.104
Yeah. excuse me for wanting
a man with a real job.

896
00:48:53.147 --> 00:48:53.931
- Wow.

897
00:49:01.982 --> 00:49:06.552
Why don't you go find you
one. because I just quit mine.

898
00:49:13.646 --> 00:49:15.996
- What do you mean
you quit your job?

899
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:16.954
- You can't hear me?

900
00:49:16.997 --> 00:49:18.129
You didn't hear what I said?

901
00:49:18.172 --> 00:49:19.652
I quit!

902
00:49:19.695 --> 00:49:20.958
- Just like that.

903
00:49:21.001 --> 00:49:23.177
Just without even
talking to me first.

904
00:49:23.221 --> 00:49:25.919
- I didn't know I need my
wife permission to quit a job.

905
00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:27.965
- It's not about
permission. Kyle.

906
00:49:28.008 --> 00:49:31.490
It's about a decision that
affects the both of us.

907
00:49:31.533 --> 00:49:32.926
And we both know
that you're not good

908
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:34.449
at making decisions by yourself.

909
00:49:34.493 --> 00:49:35.450
- Oh. there it is.

910
00:49:35.494 --> 00:49:36.234
There it is.

911
00:49:36.277 --> 00:49:37.583
I knew it was coming.

912
00:49:37.626 --> 00:49:39.193
You're not gonna let
that rest. are you?

913
00:49:39.237 --> 00:49:40.151
How long you gonna keep
throwing that in my face?

914
00:49:40.194 --> 00:49:41.152
- Never.

915
00:49:41.195 --> 00:49:42.327
You did it.

916
00:49:45.721 --> 00:49:49.116
- Have you ever asked yourself
why I did what I did. Dawn?

917
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.335
- Oh. right.

918
00:49:50.378 --> 00:49:52.598
You wanna justify
cheating on your wife?

919
00:49:52.641 --> 00:49:54.208
Let's hear it.

920
00:49:54.252 --> 00:49:55.993
Enlighten me. Kyle.

921
00:49:57.342 --> 00:49:58.734
What's the reason?

922
00:50:00.171 --> 00:50:00.998
- You.

923
00:50:03.652 --> 00:50:05.263
You are my reason.

924
00:50:08.527 --> 00:50:11.008
Bae. you walked away from me.

925
00:50:14.098 --> 00:50:16.491
You stopped talking to me.

926
00:50:16.535 --> 00:50:17.927
You stopped touching me.

927
00:50:17.971 --> 00:50:21.366
You treated me like
I wasn't even there.

928
00:50:22.497 --> 00:50:25.196
Hell. like I didn't even exist.

929
00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:31.332
I thought you was
the one that cheated.

930
00:50:36.946 --> 00:50:37.947
- I did.

931
00:50:40.559 --> 00:50:43.910
- What the hell did
you just say to me?

932
00:50:45.433 --> 00:50:47.957
What the hell did you just say?

933
00:50:49.307 --> 00:50:54.051
- When I found out that you
did what you did I got petty

934
00:50:54.094 --> 00:50:58.620
and I slept with the person
who would hurt you the most.

935
00:51:04.278 --> 00:51:06.541
- You slept with my best friend?

936
00:51:06.585 --> 00:51:07.890
- No.

937
00:51:07.934 --> 00:51:10.415
I tried. but he's
loyal to you. so...

938
00:51:17.204 --> 00:51:18.292
- If you didn't
sleep with Brandon

939
00:51:18.336 --> 00:51:20.947
who the hell did you sleep with?

940
00:51:22.644 --> 00:51:24.255
- Your boss. Eric.

941
00:51:31.392 --> 00:51:33.481
- You slept with my boss?

942
00:51:37.398 --> 00:51:38.182
Oh. fuck.

943
00:51:41.576 --> 00:51:45.537
I look at that bastard
in his face every day.

944
00:51:47.408 --> 00:51:49.193
And you been holding
this over my head?

945
00:51:49.236 --> 00:51:50.498
All of this time?

946
00:51:52.065 --> 00:51:54.546
That makes you an
ever bigger hypocrite.

947
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:57.026
- I know what that makes me.

948
00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:58.680
Do you think I care?

949
00:51:58.724 --> 00:52:01.292
- Oh. you could've
slept with anybody else.

950
00:52:01.335 --> 00:52:02.641
- No.

951
00:52:02.684 --> 00:52:04.251
I wanted you to
hurt like I hurt.

952
00:52:04.295 --> 00:52:06.775
I wanted you to feel it.

953
00:52:06.819 --> 00:52:08.299
Feel what I felt.

954
00:52:14.566 --> 00:52:16.611
- I can't believe you.

955
00:52:18.526 --> 00:52:20.615
- Well I guess that
makes the two of us.

956
00:52:20.659 --> 00:52:23.052
I couldn't believe you either.

957
00:52:26.317 --> 00:52:29.798
And since I'm the only one
bringing money in around here.

958
00:52:29.842 --> 00:52:31.931
don't mess with my phone.

959
00:52:34.934 --> 00:52:37.545
I can't afford to lose my job.

960
00:52:41.114 --> 00:52:42.028
Good night.

961
00:52:46.511 --> 00:52:47.599
- What the...

962
00:52:58.175 --> 00:53:01.700
I can't believe she
cheated on me. doc.

963
00:53:01.743 --> 00:53:04.311
I mean. I know why she did it.

964
00:53:06.661 --> 00:53:07.575
But with Eric?

965
00:53:08.707 --> 00:53:10.099
I mean. I know why him.

966
00:53:10.143 --> 00:53:10.839
But Eric?

967
00:53:13.668 --> 00:53:16.932
I can honestly say I
never thought my wife

968
00:53:16.976 --> 00:53:17.716
would cheat on me.

969
00:53:17.759 --> 00:53:19.718
I know I deserved it.

970
00:53:21.241 --> 00:53:22.024
But Eric?

971
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:30.119
Doc. I don't think I can
move forward from this one.

972
00:54:10.899 --> 00:54:11.900
- Morning. sir.

973
00:54:11.944 --> 00:54:12.858
Your groceries.

974
00:54:12.901 --> 00:54:13.902
- Thank you. man.

975
00:54:13.946 --> 00:54:14.816
- All right. sir.

976
00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:16.470
- Hold on one sec.

977
00:54:18.124 --> 00:54:18.864
- Oh. thank you. sir.

978
00:54:18.907 --> 00:54:19.908
You have a good day.

979
00:54:19.952 --> 00:54:21.301
- You do the same.

980
00:54:31.398 --> 00:54:32.530
Morning.

981
00:54:32.573 --> 00:54:33.357
- Hey.

982
00:54:35.533 --> 00:54:36.925
- How'd you sleep?

983
00:54:37.883 --> 00:54:38.797
- I didn't.

984
00:54:42.627 --> 00:54:45.282
- I'm sorry about the
phone thing. okay?

985
00:54:45.325 --> 00:54:46.674
But Eric.

986
00:54:46.718 --> 00:54:47.893
Bae. that was foul.

987
00:54:47.936 --> 00:54:49.808
- Look. I don't
wanna talk about it.

988
00:54:49.851 --> 00:54:52.114
Let's just get this day
over with so we can be done

989
00:54:52.158 --> 00:54:53.115
with all of this.

990
00:54:53.159 --> 00:54:54.029
- Okay. fine.

991
00:54:54.073 --> 00:54:55.248
That's what you wanna do?

992
00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:57.903
- Yeah. that's
what I wanna do.

993
00:54:57.946 --> 00:55:01.080
- Then what's with
them groceries?

994
00:55:01.123 --> 00:55:03.430
- I'm gonna make breakfast.

995
00:55:04.344 --> 00:55:05.476
- You gonna make breakfast?

996
00:55:05.519 --> 00:55:06.912
- Yes.

997
00:55:06.955 --> 00:55:08.000
- For me?

998
00:55:09.001 --> 00:55:09.871
- Yes.

999
00:55:09.915 --> 00:55:11.133
Is there a problem with that?

1000
00:55:11.177 --> 00:55:12.700
- Oh. yeah. I'm
not gonna eat that.

1001
00:55:12.744 --> 00:55:15.790
You might be trying
to poison me.

1002
00:55:15.834 --> 00:55:18.271
- Get out the kitchen. Kyle.

1003
00:55:20.012 --> 00:55:21.274
- Okay.

1004
00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:23.581
I'm gonna go take a shower.

1005
00:55:25.147 --> 00:55:26.714
- Thank you.

1006
00:55:39.858 --> 00:55:41.773
- Erm. where's my food?

1007
00:55:42.991 --> 00:55:45.429
- Oh. I didn't make you any.

1008
00:55:45.472 --> 00:55:47.953
- So what am I supposed to eat?

1009
00:55:53.654 --> 00:55:54.438
- Enjoy.

1010
00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:00.052
- Are you serious?

1011
00:56:00.095 --> 00:56:01.227
- What's wrong. baby?

1012
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:02.881
You don't like it?

1013
00:56:05.405 --> 00:56:06.363
Oh. hold on.

1014
00:56:07.451 --> 00:56:08.756
You better eat up.

1015
00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:12.369
Gonna need your energy
for the next activity.

1016
00:56:15.154 --> 00:56:16.764
This...

1017
00:56:16.808 --> 00:56:19.071
All of this is Malik.

1018
00:56:19.114 --> 00:56:20.377
- How you doing?

1019
00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:23.292
Hope you're ready
for a great workout?

1020
00:56:23.336 --> 00:56:24.119
- Yes.

1021
00:56:25.469 --> 00:56:27.645
- Yeah. I'm good.

1022
00:56:27.688 --> 00:56:29.081
- He's a personal trainer

1023
00:56:29.124 --> 00:56:31.953
and he's gonna be
teaching us boxing today

1024
00:56:31.997 --> 00:56:33.477
for our activity.

1025
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:34.434
- I'm gonna go ahead
and grab my equipment.

1026
00:56:34.478 --> 00:56:36.610
I'll meet y'all out back.

1027
00:56:39.483 --> 00:56:41.789
- I'm gonna go get dressed.

1028
00:56:43.008 --> 00:56:45.053
- All right. you got
some on those punches.

1029
00:56:45.097 --> 00:56:47.055
Let's go ahead and switch.

1030
00:56:49.101 --> 00:56:51.103
Now has Kyle ever worked
the mitts with you before?

1031
00:56:51.146 --> 00:56:52.452
- No. not really.

1032
00:56:52.496 --> 00:56:53.497
- Okay. well let me
see what you got.

1033
00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:55.542
Show me your jab.

1034
00:56:55.586 --> 00:56:56.413
Jab. jab.

1035
00:56:57.414 --> 00:56:58.719
Jab. jab. hook.

1036
00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:01.287
Okay. this is nice.

1037
00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:02.723
A boxing couple.

1038
00:57:02.767 --> 00:57:04.203
You don't usually
see that nowadays.

1039
00:57:04.246 --> 00:57:05.813
- Oh. we used to do a whole
lot together as a couple

1040
00:57:05.857 --> 00:57:08.163
until things became more
important for somebody.

1041
00:57:08.207 --> 00:57:09.730
- Oh...

1042
00:57:09.774 --> 00:57:10.470
Yeah. we used to do a
lot of things as a couple

1043
00:57:10.514 --> 00:57:12.167
until two became three.

1044
00:57:14.082 --> 00:57:17.738
- Okay. I'm not sure
what I just walked into

1045
00:57:17.782 --> 00:57:20.088
but I'm almost afraid to
go on to our next station.

1046
00:57:20.132 --> 00:57:21.916
Sparring.

1047
00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.743
- Yes.

1048
00:57:25.572 --> 00:57:27.182
- Okay. so what we're gonna
do is we're gonna go three.

1049
00:57:27.226 --> 00:57:28.923
one minute rounds.

1050
00:57:28.967 --> 00:57:29.707
Okay?

1051
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:30.534
Of light sparring.

1052
00:57:30.577 --> 00:57:32.187
- I like this.

1053
00:57:32.231 --> 00:57:34.625
- Okay. watch your kidney
punches and your low blows.

1054
00:57:34.668 --> 00:57:38.237
Keep your hands up and
protect yourself at all times.

1055
00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.281
Are you ready?

1056
00:57:39.325 --> 00:57:40.935
- Oh. I'm ready.

1057
00:57:40.979 --> 00:57:42.850
- Are you ready?

1058
00:57:42.894 --> 00:57:44.461
- I'm good.

1059
00:57:44.504 --> 00:57:45.331
- Go.

1060
00:57:46.332 --> 00:57:48.943
- Wait. you swinging for real.

1061
00:57:51.555 --> 00:57:53.121
Come on. Come on.

1062
00:57:58.562 --> 00:57:59.867
What can I say?

1063
00:58:01.347 --> 00:58:04.393
I gave her a free
shot and she took it.

1064
00:58:06.352 --> 00:58:08.833
She'd probably been waiting
to do that for a long time.

1065
00:58:08.876 --> 00:58:12.271
- I have been waiting
so long to do that.

1066
00:58:12.314 --> 00:58:14.403
I know it's not right to
want to hit your husband.

1067
00:58:14.447 --> 00:58:16.797
but. man. I just feel so good.

1068
00:58:22.281 --> 00:58:25.893
I'm really looking forward
to the rest of the day today.

1069
00:58:25.937 --> 00:58:26.720
Cheers.

1070
00:58:29.767 --> 00:58:31.420
Mm. that was good.

1071
00:58:33.248 --> 00:58:34.728
That was good.

1072
00:58:40.821 --> 00:58:41.996
What's your name?

1073
00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.432
- It's Rain.

1074
00:58:43.476 --> 00:58:44.651
- Rain.

1075
00:58:44.695 --> 00:58:47.785
Rain. what do you
think of my painting?

1076
00:58:47.828 --> 00:58:50.875
It doesn't really
look like yours.

1077
00:58:50.918 --> 00:58:51.702
- It's...

1078
00:58:53.617 --> 00:58:55.270
It's quite lively.

1079
00:58:57.403 --> 00:58:58.447
- Lively?

1080
00:58:58.491 --> 00:58:59.884
Yeah. it looks lively.

1081
00:58:59.927 --> 00:59:00.928
I like that.

1082
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:06.760
- Bae. you don't you think
you had enough to drink?

1083
00:59:06.804 --> 00:59:08.675
- No. I don't actually.

1084
00:59:14.376 --> 00:59:15.160
Drizzle?

1085
00:59:16.901 --> 00:59:18.119
Precipitation?

1086
00:59:20.644 --> 00:59:22.123
- It's just Rain.

1087
00:59:23.081 --> 00:59:24.169
- Rain.

1088
00:59:24.212 --> 00:59:26.301
- Yeah.
- Yeah. just Rain.

1089
00:59:26.345 --> 00:59:27.999
Do you have any kids?

1090
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.655
- Actually. I don't.

1091
00:59:31.698 --> 00:59:33.352
- Do you want any?

1092
00:59:34.353 --> 00:59:37.269
- I do. when time permits.

1093
00:59:37.312 --> 00:59:38.705
Yeah.

1094
00:59:38.749 --> 00:59:41.012
- Yeah. well hopefully
you'll be able to have them.

1095
00:59:41.055 --> 00:59:43.362
I. on the other hand. I can't.

1096
00:59:43.405 --> 00:59:44.145
- Oh.

1097
00:59:44.189 --> 00:59:45.756
- Yeah.

1098
00:59:45.799 --> 00:59:49.368
After the DNC the doctor said
that I'd be highly unlikely

1099
00:59:49.411 --> 00:59:52.327
to be able to carry a child.

1100
00:59:52.371 --> 00:59:53.502
You know and a
woman isn't a woman

1101
00:59:53.546 --> 00:59:54.634
if you can't carry a child.

1102
00:59:54.678 --> 00:59:55.548
Right?

1103
00:59:55.592 --> 00:59:56.767
- Really?

1104
00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:57.942
Bae. I mean. I
think you're being

1105
00:59:57.985 --> 00:59:59.639
a little bit
ridiculous right now.

1106
00:59:59.683 --> 01:00:02.381
- Oh. I'm being ridiculous?

1107
01:00:02.424 --> 01:00:05.166
Oh. well at least I'm
ridiculous with a job.

1108
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:06.428
Okay?

1109
01:00:06.472 --> 01:00:07.647
I can't say the
same thing for you.

1110
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:08.953
You know what?

1111
01:00:08.996 --> 01:00:10.171
And because I'm
always in control

1112
01:00:10.215 --> 01:00:13.435
and I will always be in control.

1113
01:00:38.547 --> 01:00:40.724
Why are you staring at me?

1114
01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:46.643
- I didn't know I need a
reason to stare at my wife.

1115
01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:48.601
- No. it's just creepy.

1116
01:00:53.258 --> 01:00:55.782
How long have I been out for?

1117
01:00:55.826 --> 01:00:57.784
- Five. six hours maybe.

1118
01:00:59.133 --> 01:01:00.569
- That long?

1119
01:01:00.613 --> 01:01:01.353
- Mm-hmm.

1120
01:01:02.615 --> 01:01:03.572
- How bad was I?

1121
01:01:03.616 --> 01:01:05.749
- Oh. you were pretty bad.

1122
01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:09.013
I've...

1123
01:01:09.056 --> 01:01:12.538
That's the worst
I've ever seen you.

1124
01:01:12.581 --> 01:01:16.063
- I feel like an
elephant sat on my head.

1125
01:01:16.107 --> 01:01:19.371
- I've put you some
water and some ibuprofen.

1126
01:01:19.414 --> 01:01:23.201
I knew you was gonna
need it when you woke up.

1127
01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:40.000
- What happened to the dinner?

1128
01:01:40.044 --> 01:01:41.045
- They came.

1129
01:01:42.089 --> 01:01:44.396
I sent them away though.

1130
01:01:44.439 --> 01:01:45.527
- Why?

1131
01:01:50.794 --> 01:01:53.492
- 'Cause we need to talk.

1132
01:01:53.535 --> 01:01:56.843
And not just going
through the motions.

1133
01:01:58.584 --> 01:02:00.629
Bae. we need to talk.

1134
01:02:00.673 --> 01:02:02.762
- I don't need to do that.

1135
01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:03.545
- Really?

1136
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:04.808
- No.

1137
01:02:04.851 --> 01:02:07.724
- Then explain to me
why you felt it was okay

1138
01:02:07.767 --> 01:02:10.814
for you to share the worst
experience in your life

1139
01:02:10.857 --> 01:02:15.514
with a total stranger before
ever sharing that with me?

1140
01:02:15.557 --> 01:02:17.124
- I don't know.

1141
01:02:17.168 --> 01:02:18.517
I guess I just haven't
been able to talk

1142
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.040
to anyone about that before.

1143
01:02:20.084 --> 01:02:21.650
So...

1144
01:02:21.694 --> 01:02:25.306
- Mm. so talk to her
before you talk to me?

1145
01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:27.047
- I mean. it's kind
of hard to talk about.

1146
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:29.006
I buried those feelings
a long time ago.

1147
01:02:29.049 --> 01:02:30.921
- Yeah but you buried them.
bae. before even telling me

1148
01:02:30.964 --> 01:02:32.879
that they even existed.

1149
01:02:35.708 --> 01:02:39.407
How do I know how to
help you if I don't know

1150
01:02:39.451 --> 01:02:41.366
what you're going through?

1151
01:02:41.409 --> 01:02:44.108
- Because I didn't
think that you cared.

1152
01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:47.415
- And that's where I'm confused.

1153
01:02:47.459 --> 01:02:50.854
What did I do to make
you feel that way?

1154
01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:58.426
Say something.

1155
01:03:01.734 --> 01:03:02.996
- Where were you?

1156
01:03:04.824 --> 01:03:07.348
- What do you mean.
"Where was I?"

1157
01:03:07.392 --> 01:03:10.787
- When we lost the
baby. where were you?

1158
01:03:14.181 --> 01:03:15.879
- I was right here.

1159
01:03:16.967 --> 01:03:18.490
- Yeah. physically.

1160
01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:22.886
But I needed you
emotionally. mentally.

1161
01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:27.804
I had to go through
that all by myself.

1162
01:03:30.763 --> 01:03:33.853
I never looked at
you the same since.

1163
01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:40.599
- What did I do to make
you feel that way about me?

1164
01:03:42.862 --> 01:03:45.343
- You got over him too quickly.

1165
01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.128
I carried him.

1166
01:03:48.172 --> 01:03:50.739
I felt him growing inside me.

1167
01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:56.833
And then he was just...

1168
01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:03.187
I had to go through
that all by myself

1169
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:05.972
while you were in
that room writing

1170
01:04:06.016 --> 01:04:08.409
fucking comic book characters.

1171
01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:12.457
It's like you didn't even care.

1172
01:04:14.676 --> 01:04:18.245
You just left me here
alone to deal with it.

1173
01:04:20.595 --> 01:04:21.988
You shut me out.

1174
01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:29.822
So from then on I decided
that I was gonna be in control

1175
01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.911
of whatever happened
to me from now on.

1176
01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:34.435
And that's why I work so much.

1177
01:04:34.479 --> 01:04:36.089
Because that's the
only thing that I know

1178
01:04:36.133 --> 01:04:37.874
that I can control.

1179
01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:47.057
- Every night for several
months I cried myself to sleep.

1180
01:04:54.978 --> 01:04:58.459
And every piece of
artwork that I ever drew

1181
01:04:58.503 --> 01:05:02.028
in my comic room.
I had to destroy it

1182
01:05:02.072 --> 01:05:05.814
because every piece of
paper had tears on it.

1183
01:05:09.296 --> 01:05:13.213
I didn't realize that
when I lost my son.

1184
01:05:13.257 --> 01:05:14.780
I lost my wife too.

1185
01:05:15.868 --> 01:05:17.609
- Why didn't you say anything?

1186
01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:19.654
- Say what to you?

1187
01:05:19.698 --> 01:05:20.917
- Anything.

1188
01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.310
- I'm not supposed to be weak.

1189
01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:27.488
I had to be strong.

1190
01:05:31.797 --> 01:05:34.713
I gotta feed and
protect my family.

1191
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:38.108
That's what my daddy taught me.

1192
01:05:38.151 --> 01:05:40.849
I couldn't be weak
when you were weak.

1193
01:05:40.893 --> 01:05:42.025
One of us had to be strong.

1194
01:05:42.068 --> 01:05:44.288
That's why I kept going
to work every day.

1195
01:05:44.331 --> 01:05:49.119
to a job that I hated. to
protect you. to provide for you.

1196
01:05:53.775 --> 01:05:57.040
- I just never knew
you felt like that.

1197
01:05:59.564 --> 01:06:01.566
- And so now we're here.

1198
01:06:10.662 --> 01:06:13.012
So what do we do next?

1199
01:06:13.056 --> 01:06:14.405
What do we do now?

1200
01:06:18.757 --> 01:06:20.019
- I don't know.

1201
01:06:24.197 --> 01:06:25.633
We're both completely
different people

1202
01:06:25.677 --> 01:06:28.158
than when we first got married.

1203
01:06:32.249 --> 01:06:33.641
I don't even know
if we're what's best

1204
01:06:33.685 --> 01:06:35.600
for each other anymore.

1205
01:06:58.144 --> 01:07:00.233
- I guess erm...

1206
01:07:00.277 --> 01:07:04.237
I guess that's something we
gonna have to figure out.

1207
01:07:04.281 --> 01:07:05.282
By tomorrow.

1208
01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:08.589
- Yeah. I guess so.

1209
01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.470
- Can I ask you a question?

1210
01:07:20.514 --> 01:07:21.298
- Yeah.

1211
01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:32.526
- Do you still love me?

1212
01:07:38.184 --> 01:07:39.316
- Yeah. I do.

1213
01:07:42.754 --> 01:07:44.408
Do you still love me?

1214
01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:54.505
- Yeah. I do.

1215
01:07:56.594 --> 01:07:57.377
I do.

1216
01:08:10.738 --> 01:08:11.609
It's crazy.

1217
01:08:14.177 --> 01:08:18.006
You can live with
someone for so long

1218
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:21.662
and not really know
who they really are

1219
01:08:21.706 --> 01:08:23.142
or what they're
truly dealing with.

1220
01:08:23.186 --> 01:08:25.405
We both assumed that we knew.

1221
01:08:28.539 --> 01:08:30.323
It was something else.

1222
01:08:33.848 --> 01:08:36.851
- This is the first time
in a really long time

1223
01:08:36.895 --> 01:08:41.552
that we've actually been able
to express our true feelings

1224
01:08:41.595 --> 01:08:45.425
to one another without
having to defend ourselves.

1225
01:08:45.469 --> 01:08:47.906
I mean. I guess I
can say I see Kyle

1226
01:08:47.949 --> 01:08:50.038
completely different now.

1227
01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:54.434
I actually feel
closer to him now

1228
01:08:54.478 --> 01:08:57.220
than when we first got married.

1229
01:08:58.525 --> 01:09:01.702
- She told me she loved
me for the first time

1230
01:09:01.746 --> 01:09:03.051
in a long time.

1231
01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:06.925
Doc. that felt so good.

1232
01:09:08.622 --> 01:09:10.624
I couldn't believe it.

1233
01:09:10.668 --> 01:09:13.540
I actually thought
Dawn hated me.

1234
01:09:19.372 --> 01:09:21.287
Guess I was wrong. huh?

1235
01:09:23.115 --> 01:09:25.726
Tomorrow's decision day.

1236
01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:30.035
And to be honest I don't know
if we can continue on the way

1237
01:09:30.078 --> 01:09:33.560
that we were now that
we know what we know.

1238
01:09:43.744 --> 01:09:44.702
- So how
have things been going

1239
01:09:44.745 --> 01:09:46.182
these past few days?

1240
01:09:46.225 --> 01:09:49.010
- Erm. it's been interesting
to say the least.

1241
01:09:49.054 --> 01:09:51.535
- It seems you all are a lot
more pleasant around each other

1242
01:09:51.578 --> 01:09:53.232
and that's an accomplishment.

1243
01:09:53.276 --> 01:09:54.102
- We are.

1244
01:09:54.929 --> 01:09:56.670
- I'd say so.

1245
01:09:56.714 --> 01:10:00.979
- So have we made up our minds
on what we're going to do?

1246
01:10:01.022 --> 01:10:02.807
- Yeah. I think we have.

1247
01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:03.808
Kyle?

1248
01:10:03.851 --> 01:10:05.679
- Yeah. I think so.

1249
01:10:05.723 --> 01:10:07.159
- Yeah.

1250
01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:08.508
- Sounds great.

1251
01:10:09.335 --> 01:10:12.556
Well. Dawn. why don't you start

1252
01:10:12.599 --> 01:10:15.602
and tell Kyle what
your decision is?

1253
01:10:16.951 --> 01:10:21.434
- Well. Kyle. I know that we
haven't been the best couple

1254
01:10:21.478 --> 01:10:26.309
in the past few years and at
times it's been really hard

1255
01:10:26.352 --> 01:10:27.658
to talk to one another.

1256
01:10:27.701 --> 01:10:29.573
- Er. yeah.

1257
01:10:29.616 --> 01:10:33.838
- And we both have done
things to hurt each other.

1258
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:39.670
And we both drive each
other completely insane.

1259
01:10:39.713 --> 01:10:40.540
- Yeah.

1260
01:10:40.584 --> 01:10:42.150
- Yes.

1261
01:10:42.194 --> 01:10:46.067
But there's no one I'd rather
go crazy with in this world

1262
01:10:46.111 --> 01:10:47.373
other than you.

1263
01:10:48.635 --> 01:10:51.986
So I really hope that
we can make this work.

1264
01:10:53.553 --> 01:10:57.209
- And. Kyle. why don't you
tell Dawn your decision?

1265
01:10:58.471 --> 01:11:01.953
- Bae. I so wanted this
weekend to work for us.

1266
01:11:04.912 --> 01:11:05.870
Desperately.

1267
01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:10.657
I felt like we owed it
to each other to give.

1268
01:11:10.701 --> 01:11:11.615
to give us one last shot.

1269
01:11:11.658 --> 01:11:12.311
You know?

1270
01:11:13.617 --> 01:11:16.924
You opened up to me in a
way that you have never

1271
01:11:16.968 --> 01:11:20.885
done before since we've been
married on the last night.

1272
01:11:20.928 --> 01:11:23.409
I'm grateful to you for that.

1273
01:11:24.889 --> 01:11:27.065
But I can't go on like this.

1274
01:11:35.813 --> 01:11:37.205
- Are you serious?

1275
01:11:39.425 --> 01:11:42.733
What about the
conversation last night?

1276
01:11:44.996 --> 01:11:47.868
You're just not
gonna say anything?

1277
01:11:49.174 --> 01:11:50.958
I can't believe you.

1278
01:11:51.002 --> 01:11:52.003
- I'm sorry.

1279
01:11:52.046 --> 01:11:52.917
- Fine.

1280
01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.006
You just. you wanna be done?

1281
01:11:55.049 --> 01:11:56.050
Fine. There.

1282
01:11:57.748 --> 01:11:59.010
- Wait. wait. wait. wait.

1283
01:11:59.053 --> 01:11:59.837
- No. Kyle. what?

1284
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.881
- Wait.

1285
01:12:00.925 --> 01:12:02.187
- What?

1286
01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:03.580
- I don't want to be
married to the woman

1287
01:12:03.623 --> 01:12:05.843
that I was married to before.

1288
01:12:07.148 --> 01:12:09.760
Bae. she was mean.
ugly and nasty.

1289
01:12:11.109 --> 01:12:14.417
Who want to be married
to a woman like that?

1290
01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:19.291
Bae. I wanna be married to the
woman who I met last night.

1291
01:12:20.466 --> 01:12:23.600
I wanna be vulnerable with her.

1292
01:12:23.643 --> 01:12:28.344
I wanna be with her mentally.
physically and emotionally.

1293
01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:36.090
I wanna be with her. if
she wanna be with me.

1294
01:12:45.665 --> 01:12:47.537
You not gonna say anything?

1295
01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:50.278
- You didn't ask
me anything yet.

1296
01:12:52.977 --> 01:12:55.196
- Dawn. will you marry me?

1297
01:12:56.502 --> 01:12:59.331
- Well I have a few items
that I need to add first.

1298
01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.028
- Okay. are you
serious right now?

1299
01:13:01.072 --> 01:13:02.290
This what we doing. huh?

1300
01:13:02.334 --> 01:13:03.770
That's what we doing?

1301
01:13:03.814 --> 01:13:05.119
- Yes.

1302
01:13:05.163 --> 01:13:07.905
Yes. I will marry you.

1303
01:13:07.948 --> 01:13:08.688
Yes.

1304
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:11.430
Oh my gosh.

1305
01:13:14.477 --> 01:13:15.303
- Awesome.

1306
01:13:16.479 --> 01:13:18.568
I'll start getting
things together.

1307
01:13:18.611 --> 01:13:19.482
- For what?

1308
01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:21.571
- The wedding.

1309
01:13:22.702 --> 01:13:24.530
- Whose wedding?

1310
01:13:24.574 --> 01:13:25.357
- Yours.

1311
01:13:27.098 --> 01:13:28.012
- Who's that?

1312
01:13:28.055 --> 01:13:29.448
- I'll get that.

1313
01:13:30.318 --> 01:13:32.059
- What is going on?

1314
01:13:44.158 --> 01:13:46.204
- Well we couldn't miss
our best friend's wedding.

1315
01:13:46.247 --> 01:13:48.075
What kind of best
friends would we be?

1316
01:13:48.119 --> 01:13:49.990
- Oh. you know my dog
couldn't have a wedding

1317
01:13:50.034 --> 01:13:51.470
without his best man.

1318
01:13:51.514 --> 01:13:55.169
- And I got my girl's
back as a maid of honor.

1319
01:13:55.213 --> 01:13:56.780
- This is crazy.

1320
01:13:56.823 --> 01:13:58.303
How did you guys do this?

1321
01:13:58.346 --> 01:14:01.175
- Erm. I called my
best friend last night.

1322
01:14:01.219 --> 01:14:02.655
told him what I wanted to do.

1323
01:14:02.699 --> 01:14:05.745
He called Toya and Dr.
Shelton and now we're here.

1324
01:14:05.789 --> 01:14:06.659
- Yeah.

1325
01:14:06.703 --> 01:14:07.747
- I thought he was crazy.

1326
01:14:07.791 --> 01:14:08.531
- Why?

1327
01:14:08.574 --> 01:14:09.749
- She could've said no.

1328
01:14:09.793 --> 01:14:11.272
- Oh. yeah.

1329
01:14:11.316 --> 01:14:12.883
And then we're like. .

1330
01:14:12.926 --> 01:14:13.710
- Right.

1331
01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:17.453
- Yeah. no.

1332
01:14:17.496 --> 01:14:18.932
- Oh. chill out.

1333
01:14:18.976 --> 01:14:20.107
- Oh my gosh.

1334
01:14:23.371 --> 01:14:24.329
- I love you.

1335
01:14:24.372 --> 01:14:25.112
- I love you too.

1336
01:14:25.156 --> 01:14:26.200
- All right. all right.

1337
01:14:26.244 --> 01:14:27.941
There is plenty
of time for that.

1338
01:14:27.985 --> 01:14:30.335
Now I only have a couple
of hours to get you beat.

1339
01:14:30.378 --> 01:14:31.162
Let's go.

1340
01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:39.692
- Ooh. I am killing
this suit. bro.

1341
01:14:41.302 --> 01:14:42.956
Appreciate you for giving
me a reason to put it on.

1342
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:43.870
- Come on. man.

1343
01:14:43.914 --> 01:14:45.132
You know it don't take much

1344
01:14:45.176 --> 01:14:45.872
for you to get
suited and booted.

1345
01:14:45.916 --> 01:14:47.308
- Well. what can I say?

1346
01:14:47.352 --> 01:14:48.396
You know.

1347
01:14:52.139 --> 01:14:52.879
- B?

1348
01:14:52.923 --> 01:14:54.141
- Mm. what's up?

1349
01:14:54.185 --> 01:14:57.841
- I need to ask you
a question. man.

1350
01:14:57.884 --> 01:15:01.758
Why you never told me
that my wife came at you?

1351
01:15:03.716 --> 01:15:05.675
- Look. my bad. bro.

1352
01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:07.415
I wanted to tell you
but I didn't wanna make

1353
01:15:07.459 --> 01:15:09.809
things awkward between us.

1354
01:15:09.853 --> 01:15:12.159
- How would it be awkward. B?

1355
01:15:12.203 --> 01:15:14.858
- Okay. so let's say I tell you.

1356
01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:15.772
- Mm-hmm.

1357
01:15:15.815 --> 01:15:16.599
- All right. you confront her.

1358
01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:18.122
- Okay.
- She denies it.

1359
01:15:18.165 --> 01:15:20.211
What happens to me?

1360
01:15:20.254 --> 01:15:22.126
I lose my best
friend of 20 years.

1361
01:15:22.169 --> 01:15:24.345
Or I tell you. you confront
her and she admits it

1362
01:15:24.389 --> 01:15:25.956
and you stay with her.

1363
01:15:25.999 --> 01:15:27.566
Then what happens to us?

1364
01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:30.700
Awkward holiday
parties. birthdays.

1365
01:15:30.743 --> 01:15:32.440
Look. I was told never
to get in your friend's

1366
01:15:32.484 --> 01:15:34.486
relationships unless they
ask you your opinion.

1367
01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:37.271
and then you still gotta be
careful about what you say.

1368
01:15:37.315 --> 01:15:40.797
Honestly. I was just
looking out for y'all.

1369
01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.363
- Yeah. I get that.

1370
01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:47.455
But part of me still want
to know how it went down.

1371
01:15:47.499 --> 01:15:48.239
- Bro.

1372
01:15:48.282 --> 01:15:49.545
- Real talk. fam.

1373
01:15:51.155 --> 01:15:53.461
- All right. she came over one
night. drunk. talking crazy.

1374
01:15:53.505 --> 01:15:55.072
- Mm.

1375
01:15:55.115 --> 01:15:57.291
- I shut her down
and drove her home.

1376
01:15:57.335 --> 01:15:59.293
Case closed.

1377
01:15:59.337 --> 01:16:01.295
Why would I mess up a
friendship of 20 years

1378
01:16:01.339 --> 01:16:02.688
over a drunk night?

1379
01:16:02.732 --> 01:16:04.342
That'd never happen.

1380
01:16:05.778 --> 01:16:07.388
- All right. man.

1381
01:16:07.432 --> 01:16:09.565
I appreciate you. bro.

1382
01:16:09.608 --> 01:16:11.262
- No doubt.

1383
01:16:11.305 --> 01:16:13.569
Now. let's get you married.

1384
01:17:02.226 --> 01:17:04.010
- And now that Dawn and
Kyle have come together

1385
01:17:04.054 --> 01:17:06.665
and have sealed their
vows to one another

1386
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:09.668
by the exchanging of rings.
and pledged their commitment

1387
01:17:09.712 --> 01:17:12.802
to one another by the
exchanging of vows.

1388
01:17:12.845 --> 01:17:15.935
I now by the authority
of God pronounce them

1389
01:17:15.979 --> 01:17:17.545
husband and wife.

1390
01:17:18.503 --> 01:17:21.158
And whatsoever God
has joined together.

1391
01:17:21.201 --> 01:17:23.203
let not man put asunder.

1392
01:17:24.422 --> 01:17:27.120
Kyle. you may now
kiss your wife.

1393
01:17:30.994 --> 01:17:32.648
- Yeah. man.
- Yes!

1394
01:18:07.726 --> 01:18:09.293
- Hey. what's up bro?

1395
01:18:09.336 --> 01:18:11.599
You thought over our-

1396
01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:41.804
- Hey babe.

1397
01:18:41.847 --> 01:18:45.590
- Hey. so what color do
you think looks best?

1398
01:18:47.853 --> 01:18:50.943
- The one in your
right hand looks good.

1399
01:18:50.987 --> 01:18:52.075
- You didn't even look.

1400
01:18:52.118 --> 01:18:53.903
- Yes. I did.

1401
01:18:53.946 --> 01:18:57.123
- All right. what's
it look like?

1402
01:18:57.167 --> 01:18:57.950
- Erm...

1403
01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:01.954
Yellow.

1404
01:19:01.998 --> 01:19:03.086
- I can't stand you.

1405
01:19:03.129 --> 01:19:04.130
You didn't even look.

1406
01:19:04.174 --> 01:19:07.394
There's not even
any yellow here.

1407
01:19:07.438 --> 01:19:08.439
- I'm sorry.

1408
01:19:09.309 --> 01:19:10.746
This is ridiculous.

1409
01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:12.748
Who is this?

1410
01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:15.098
Oh. it's here.

1411
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.969
- What is it?

1412
01:19:17.013 --> 01:19:18.928
- Hold on one second.

1413
01:19:19.842 --> 01:19:20.843
- Oh.

1414
01:19:34.421 --> 01:19:35.553
- My book. bae.

1415
01:19:35.596 --> 01:19:37.468
- Ah. congratulations.

1416
01:19:37.511 --> 01:19:38.774
- This looks good.

1417
01:19:38.817 --> 01:19:39.818
- Yes. it does.

1418
01:19:42.821 --> 01:19:43.953
- You know. this
came just in time

1419
01:19:43.996 --> 01:19:45.606
for the publisher's
meeting next week.

1420
01:19:48.218 --> 01:19:49.001
- Hold on.

1421
01:19:51.482 --> 01:19:52.222
Hello?

1422
01:19:52.265 --> 01:19:53.005
- Dawn?

1423
01:19:53.049 --> 01:19:54.354
- Oh. hi. Mr. Sawyer.

1424
01:19:54.398 --> 01:19:55.399
- Are you and the
family doing well today?

1425
01:19:55.442 --> 01:19:56.792
- Yes. we're good.

1426
01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:57.923
Thanks for asking.

1427
01:19:57.967 --> 01:19:58.837
- That's wonderful.

1428
01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:00.360
Hey. can you come back in?

1429
01:20:00.404 --> 01:20:01.840
- Oh. you need me to come
back into the office today?

1430
01:20:01.884 --> 01:20:02.928
- Yeah. we're going
