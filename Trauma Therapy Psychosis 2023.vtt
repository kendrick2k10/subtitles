3
00:00:51.486 --> 00:00:53.401
Three. two. one.

4
00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:55.968
And...

5
00:00:55.968 --> 00:00:56.795
We're live.

6
00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:00.930
How you doin'. Victor?

7
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.757
I'm doing great.

8
00:01:01.757 --> 00:01:03.237
Thanks for askin'.

9
00:01:03.237 --> 00:01:05.108
Okay. so just for the
audience not familiar with you.

10
00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:06.544
briefly introduce yourself.

11
00:01:06.544 --> 00:01:10.679
and what you did for the
infamous Vance Institute.

12
00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:11.984
I was an ex-con

13
00:01:12.898 --> 00:01:14.509
who got a second chance at life

14
00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.426
when I came across one of
Tobin Vance's self-help books.

15
00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:20.167
And when I was done doing my time.

16
00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:22.560
I became a nurse and nutritionist.

17
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.649
and started working at the institute.

18
00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.042
Now. that's interesting.

19
00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:30.046
You still credit Tobin
Vance for saving your life.

20
00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:32.701
even after all the things
he's been accused of?

21
00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:37.097
You can't discount
his earlier accomplishments

22
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.534
just because things went south
later on.

23
00:01:43.364 --> 00:01:44.234
Results.

24
00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:46.758
That's what I'm talking about.

25
00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:48.412
In fact. that's all I preach.

26
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.372
If I told you I could
save your dying child.

27
00:01:51.372 --> 00:01:52.547
would you care how I did it?

28
00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:54.114
No!

29
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:58.205
You'd only be concerned with the results.

30
00:01:58.205 --> 00:02:02.122
If I told you I could erase
all your fears. insecurities.

31
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.993
and personal issues.

32
00:02:03.993 --> 00:02:06.256
would ya care how I did it?

33
00:02:06.256 --> 00:02:07.127
No.

34
00:02:08.084 --> 00:02:10.086
You'd only be concerned about
one thing.

35
00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:12.610
The results.

36
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.309
Him. what's his file say?

37
00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:16.832
That's Daniel White.

38
00:02:16.832 --> 00:02:19.704
His parents died in a
fire when he was a child.

39
00:02:19.704 --> 00:02:22.359
Has suicidal thoughts and tendencies.

40
00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:23.578
Alcoholic.

41
00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:26.407
Completed all of the Vance
online courses.

42
00:02:26.407 --> 00:02:27.538
Put him on the list.

43
00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:29.627
No.

44
00:02:29.627 --> 00:02:32.108
Suicidal tendencies are too unpredictable.

45
00:02:32.108 --> 00:02:34.415
Tobin says. "They make the
best members if they pass.

46
00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:36.243
and if they don't. they
got what they wanted".

47
00:02:36.243 --> 00:02:37.592
Win/win.

48
00:02:37.592 --> 00:02:39.202
Need I remind you

49
00:02:39.202 --> 00:02:41.944
that you're only supposed to
play your part and shadow me?

50
00:02:41.944 --> 00:02:43.293
They missed the big picture.

51
00:02:43.293 --> 00:02:44.120
It's almost like looking at

52
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.165
the cracks of the statue.

53
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.862
instead of the art itself.
- Hmm.

54
00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:48.864
Okay. put him on the list.

55
00:02:50.257 --> 00:02:51.693
But if anything happens.

56
00:02:53.347 --> 00:02:55.827
you have to repeat that
statement to Tobin.

57
00:02:55.827 --> 00:02:56.698
Copy that.

58
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:00.615
So you need to ask yourself.

59
00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:05.663
what would it mean to you
to get everything you want

60
00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:06.621
in this world?

61
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.712
And that answer.

62
00:03:10.712 --> 00:03:13.149
it better be amazing.

63
00:03:15.717 --> 00:03:17.545
Let's back it up. okay?

64
00:03:17.545 --> 00:03:20.678
Tobin Vance. for the past 20 years.

65
00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:25.466
has been one of the leading
self-help gurus in...

66
00:03:25.466 --> 00:03:26.902
The US?

67
00:03:26.902 --> 00:03:29.426
- In the world.
- The world.

68
00:03:29.426 --> 00:03:33.517
Over 20.000 people
signed up for his course.

69
00:03:33.517 --> 00:03:38.218
and he has ardent. dedicated
followers. like yourself?

70
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.044
That's right.

71
00:03:39.044 --> 00:03:40.959
It all came

72
00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.136
crashing down!

73
00:03:44.136 --> 00:03:48.532
Racketeering. sexual
abuse. money laundering.

74
00:03:48.532 --> 00:03:49.925
Many of the victims.

75
00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:53.145
or survivors. as they
prefer to be referred to.

76
00:03:53.145 --> 00:03:55.322
say that they were manipulated.

77
00:03:55.322 --> 00:03:59.021
that what started out as a
self-help

78
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:00.240
and leadership seminar

79
00:04:01.197 --> 00:04:02.981
became a cult.

80
00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:06.202
Hello.

81
00:04:06.202 --> 00:04:08.117
I am Dr. Elizabeth White.

82
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:11.468
and I'm here to say. congratulations.

83
00:04:12.774 --> 00:04:13.949
You've all been chosen.

84
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.126
For what?

85
00:04:17.996 --> 00:04:21.435
The Vance Institute Advanced
Treatment Program. John.

86
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:24.481
This is a five day retreat.

87
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:28.006
where you will be guaranteed results.

88
00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:30.226
You all have contracts.

89
00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:32.184
and I'd like you to review the details.

90
00:04:32.184 --> 00:04:33.925
So this is some kind of

91
00:04:35.536 --> 00:04:37.189
advanced training?

92
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:38.452
Mm-hmm.

93
00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:39.322
It's happening.

94
00:04:39.322 --> 00:04:40.671
It's actually happening!

95
00:04:40.671 --> 00:04:41.803
Yes. Frank.

96
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:45.241
And you are all followers of
Tobin Vance

97
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:47.765
and the Vance Institute Training Program.

98
00:04:47.765 --> 00:04:49.898
and we feel that you have the potential

99
00:04:49.898 --> 00:04:52.379
to be active contributing members.

100
00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:53.989
You filled
out a form

101
00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:55.033
when you came here today.

102
00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:57.297
and we feel we can help you.

103
00:04:58.472 --> 00:04:59.908
How?

104
00:04:59.908 --> 00:05:01.692
You are all invited

105
00:05:01.692 --> 00:05:06.306
to the Vance Institute Advanced
Treatment Retreat Center

106
00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:07.437
in Kirkcaldy. Scotland.

107
00:05:07.437 --> 00:05:08.699
Wow!

108
00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.701
It's definitely something to
say wow to.

109
00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:13.225
But we are also hoping
that you'll say yes to it.

110
00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:14.314
Please review the contracts.

111
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.750
We want to make sure that you are

112
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.100
freely entering into
this agreement with us.

113
00:05:20.668 --> 00:05:21.495
Yes. John?

114
00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:26.587
It says this is $75.000.

115
00:05:28.893 --> 00:05:33.637
Yes. but here's the good news.

116
00:05:33.637 --> 00:05:34.899
That fee is waived.

117
00:05:35.987 --> 00:05:39.121
You'll only be charged that
amount if you decide to quit.

118
00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:41.036
I don't know if I'm
ready for this program.

119
00:05:41.036 --> 00:05:42.516
You're not sure?

120
00:05:42.516 --> 00:05:45.301
A five day retreat in
the middle of the woods?

121
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:46.389
I mean. I just don't know

122
00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:47.303
if I'm ready.
- Are you not ready

123
00:05:47.303 --> 00:05:48.260
to get over your problems. John?

124
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.827
I mean. I'd love that.

125
00:05:49.827 --> 00:05:50.654
I'd love that.

126
00:05:50.654 --> 00:05:51.525
But-
- But...

127
00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.745
But is the killer word. John.

128
00:05:56.268 --> 00:05:58.706
I'm inclined to agree with you. John.

129
00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:02.449
You're not ready.

130
00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.104
That means Tobin does not
want you in the program.

131
00:06:07.454 --> 00:06:08.280
Wait.

132
00:06:09.151 --> 00:06:10.413
Would-
- Good luck. John.

133
00:06:10.413 --> 00:06:13.590
with your life. and your issues.

134
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.461
Fuck!

135
00:06:16.463 --> 00:06:17.594
Well...

136
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.731
The door is there.

137
00:06:30.085 --> 00:06:32.174
Anyone else?

138
00:06:32.174 --> 00:06:33.523
Great!

139
00:06:33.523 --> 00:06:36.396
Now we have a group ready for change.

140
00:07:00.637 --> 00:07:01.856
Welcome.

141
00:07:01.856 --> 00:07:03.814
Welcome. welcome.

142
00:07:03.814 --> 00:07:05.686
I hope you're all as excited to
be here

143
00:07:05.686 --> 00:07:06.991
as we are to have you?

144
00:07:08.123 --> 00:07:10.125
Please. please. form a
half-circle around the fire

145
00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:11.300
and we can get started.

146
00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:14.477
It's freezing.

147
00:07:14.477 --> 00:07:16.479
That's not an accident. Lily.

148
00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:21.179
It's freezing because life
is cold. harsh. unforgiving.

149
00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:22.529
Comfort!

150
00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:24.661
Comfort breeds weak mammals.

151
00:07:24.661 --> 00:07:26.489
and we're all mammals. are we
not?

152
00:07:27.664 --> 00:07:30.275
Struggles in life could make us stronger

153
00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:31.755
or they could crush us.

154
00:07:31.755 --> 00:07:32.756
but not us.

155
00:07:32.756 --> 00:07:35.672
because we are about to evolve.

156
00:07:35.672 --> 00:07:38.980
We're about to shed the husk of
the weak.

157
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.461
the impulsive. the
mournful. the deceitful.

158
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.027
Say yes to this!

159
00:07:43.027 --> 00:07:43.898
Yes.

160
00:07:44.768 --> 00:07:47.249
Now. before you were invited here.

161
00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:48.511
you were given a request

162
00:07:48.511 --> 00:07:50.557
to bring an item of extreme importance.

163
00:07:50.557 --> 00:07:53.429
Now. this personal object
should have significant meaning.

164
00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:55.779
It should be a representation

165
00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:59.043
of the life that you want to
leave behind.

166
00:07:59.043 --> 00:08:01.350
If you'll all pull out
these objects. please?

167
00:08:05.963 --> 00:08:08.444
When a lobster gets too big for
its shell.

168
00:08:08.444 --> 00:08:09.489
it breaks free.

169
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.403
and then it's weak.

170
00:08:11.403 --> 00:08:13.188
It's vulnerable. it's raw.

171
00:08:13.188 --> 00:08:16.539
and it needs to build a
thicker. stronger shell.

172
00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:18.280
We. here. now!

173
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.501
We are shedding our shells.

174
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.286
Now. we'll go around one by one.

175
00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:27.637
and you can explain your
object and its significance.

176
00:08:29.465 --> 00:08:30.292
Jesse.

177
00:08:32.903 --> 00:08:35.602
My parents sent me
off to boarding school.

178
00:08:35.602 --> 00:08:37.908
but I didn't quite fit in with
the others.

179
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:42.304
The headmaster noticed that
I had an eye for detail.

180
00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:45.176
and said I might enjoy reading about

181
00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:47.570
the greatest detective there
ever was.

182
00:08:49.093 --> 00:08:51.792
To this day. never been without
a copy.

183
00:08:52.793 --> 00:08:55.447
Sometimes people focus
too much on the details

184
00:08:55.447 --> 00:08:56.840
and they miss the big picture.

185
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.450
It's almost like looking
at the cracks in a statue.

186
00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.756
instead of the art itself.

187
00:09:01.323 --> 00:09:02.150
Nicole.

188
00:09:03.847 --> 00:09:07.677
My father gave me this
doll for my birthday

189
00:09:09.853 --> 00:09:11.594
the year before my mother shot him.

190
00:09:13.683 --> 00:09:16.338
It was all I had left of who he was

191
00:09:16.338 --> 00:09:17.644
- before he-
- Before

192
00:09:18.645 --> 00:09:19.863
your mother went to jail

193
00:09:19.863 --> 00:09:21.952
and you became ward of
the state at 13. right?

194
00:09:23.214 --> 00:09:24.868
Right.

195
00:09:24.868 --> 00:09:28.611
So that doll represents
someone who is never really there.

196
00:09:28.611 --> 00:09:30.613
These people were predators.

197
00:09:30.613 --> 00:09:32.876
and you defended the
sheep's cloak they wore.

198
00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:35.705
Lily.

199
00:09:40.405 --> 00:09:41.493
When I was little.

200
00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:45.149
our house was filled
with photos of my mother.

201
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.804
I look at this photo.

202
00:09:47.804 --> 00:09:49.763
think that my mom was a princess.

203
00:09:51.286 --> 00:09:53.244
She died of cancer when I was 14.

204
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.381
Your mother was Feria Lee?

205
00:09:59.381 --> 00:10:00.687
Yes.

206
00:10:00.687 --> 00:10:04.386
Okay. from 1980. she started modeling.

207
00:10:04.386 --> 00:10:07.041
and did her last runway in 1986.

208
00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:11.219
Then from '86 to '92. she
raised you. wrote two books.

209
00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:12.742
trained show dogs.

210
00:10:12.742 --> 00:10:14.831
and increased funding and
research for breast cancer.

211
00:10:14.831 --> 00:10:17.355
and yet. the image you hold onto

212
00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:19.444
is something that existed for
six years.

213
00:10:20.794 --> 00:10:23.361
If I asked your mother what her
greatest accomplishment was.

214
00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:25.320
do you think she'd say
her modeling career?

215
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.279
Frank.

216
00:10:30.281 --> 00:10:33.197
This is a game token
from Time Warp Arcade.

217
00:10:34.285 --> 00:10:35.112
Go on.

218
00:10:35.983 --> 00:10:37.506
Was.

219
00:10:37.506 --> 00:10:40.335
It's an arcade token I've kept
with me since I was a kid.

220
00:10:40.335 --> 00:10:42.424
You liked arcade games?

221
00:10:42.424 --> 00:10:43.686
I was obsessed. yeah.

222
00:10:45.688 --> 00:10:48.256
You told us you lost your
brother in a car accident

223
00:10:48.256 --> 00:10:49.692
when you were 11. right?

224
00:10:49.692 --> 00:10:51.302
Yeah.

225
00:10:51.302 --> 00:10:55.089
And where were you going when
the car got in the accident?

226
00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:58.048
Time Warp Arcade.

227
00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:01.356
Who was driving?

228
00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:05.055
My dad.

229
00:11:06.535 --> 00:11:08.102
You get along with your
father?

230
00:11:09.843 --> 00:11:10.670
He hates me.

231
00:11:11.845 --> 00:11:13.760
After that day. did he hit you
ever?

232
00:11:16.763 --> 00:11:17.589
All the time.

233
00:11:18.982 --> 00:11:20.027
Hmm.

234
00:11:20.027 --> 00:11:21.898
You think you deserved it?

235
00:11:21.898 --> 00:11:22.769
Well. I did. yeah.

236
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.425
I was the shit brother.

237
00:11:27.425 --> 00:11:29.166
Frank. look at me!

238
00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:31.429
Your father was driving.

239
00:11:31.429 --> 00:11:32.822
You blame yourself.

240
00:11:32.822 --> 00:11:35.172
You play that victim card.

241
00:11:35.172 --> 00:11:37.740
But your father was too weak of
a person

242
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.133
to admit that it was his fault.

243
00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:40.482
and he blamed you.

244
00:11:40.482 --> 00:11:42.049
so you carry the weight of that blame.

245
00:11:42.049 --> 00:11:43.877
You carry the weight of that token.

246
00:11:43.877 --> 00:11:45.443
and it's weighing you down.

247
00:11:45.443 --> 00:11:49.709
You haven't even begun to become
the man that you could be.

248
00:11:51.014 --> 00:11:51.841
Daniel.

249
00:11:56.933 --> 00:11:58.587
I see where this is going.

250
00:11:59.893 --> 00:12:00.720
Okay.

251
00:12:04.245 --> 00:12:05.725
This was my dad's...

252
00:12:09.119 --> 00:12:11.208
My dad's favorite bourbon.

253
00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:12.732
And what happened to your
father?

254
00:12:13.907 --> 00:12:15.560
You know all about us.

255
00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.040
That seems-
- What happened?

256
00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.088
He committed suicide.

257
00:12:23.612 --> 00:12:24.439
You miss him?

258
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.441
Every day.

259
00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:29.966
He blamed you for ruining
his life. didn't he?

260
00:12:32.142 --> 00:12:32.969
Yeah.

261
00:12:34.014 --> 00:12:37.495
Your father placed an
enormous burden on you to carry.

262
00:12:37.495 --> 00:12:39.149
You drink to feel numb.

263
00:12:40.455 --> 00:12:43.675
Folks. I want you all to
destroy these objects.

264
00:12:43.675 --> 00:12:45.416
Place them right in the fire.

265
00:12:45.416 --> 00:12:47.592
because these objects are
holding us back

266
00:12:47.592 --> 00:12:52.249
from becoming the people
that we were meant to be.

267
00:12:56.819 --> 00:12:58.429
Fuck it!

268
00:13:13.096 --> 00:13:13.967
Hand it to me. Daniel.

269
00:13:13.967 --> 00:13:14.837
I'll throw it in for you.

270
00:13:14.837 --> 00:13:16.534
Don't. Frank!

271
00:13:16.534 --> 00:13:18.188
That's Daniel's past to discard.

272
00:13:20.887 --> 00:13:22.540
He doesn't look so good.

273
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.282
Frank has
his own demons to face.

274
00:13:25.282 --> 00:13:26.893
You're all free to throw on a blanket.

275
00:13:26.893 --> 00:13:29.678
and Elizabeth will lead you
back to the retreat house.

276
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.908
What's wrong. Daniel?

277
00:13:43.997 --> 00:13:44.867
Don't like fire.

278
00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:46.826
Daniel. look at me.

279
00:13:49.219 --> 00:13:50.046
Look at me!

280
00:13:51.482 --> 00:13:53.397
You could stay where you are.

281
00:13:53.397 --> 00:13:54.746
You can live in the past.

282
00:13:54.746 --> 00:13:56.879
or you could face your fears.

283
00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:59.273
and become the person
that you were meant to be.

284
00:14:02.493 --> 00:14:04.104
I can't.

285
00:14:07.803 --> 00:14:10.110
The retreat is about a
quarter mile from here.

286
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.676
You can walk there yourself.

287
00:14:11.676 --> 00:14:13.765
and one of my associates will
get your

288
00:14:13.765 --> 00:14:16.377
fucking worthless ass off my property.

289
00:14:16.377 --> 00:14:18.248
you weak fuck!

290
00:14:18.248 --> 00:14:19.902
And then we'll send you the bill.

291
00:15:26.273 --> 00:15:27.491
Your phones.

292
00:15:28.405 --> 00:15:31.191
Having no contact with the
outside world

293
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:33.193
will be essential for your growth.

294
00:15:35.499 --> 00:15:38.241
You'll be returned your phones
by the end of the retreat.

295
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:41.375
Yes. Jesse?

296
00:15:42.202 --> 00:15:43.420
What's with the rooms?

297
00:15:45.031 --> 00:15:46.554
I'm not sure what that means?

298
00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:51.167
The walls in the rooms.
they're reinforced.

299
00:15:52.255 --> 00:15:54.301
You're planning to lock us in?

300
00:15:54.301 --> 00:15:56.651
God. no!

301
00:15:57.565 --> 00:15:58.958
You can try the locks yourselves.

302
00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.221
There's no way to lock
them from the outside.

303
00:16:02.135 --> 00:16:04.659
But they are soundproof.

304
00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:07.314
Why is that?

305
00:16:07.314 --> 00:16:08.619
In the past.

306
00:16:08.619 --> 00:16:10.752
different people have
reacted in varying ways

307
00:16:10.752 --> 00:16:11.622
to the treatment.

308
00:16:12.884 --> 00:16:15.191
Some yell and scream.

309
00:16:15.191 --> 00:16:17.715
some laugh. some talk to themselves.

310
00:16:17.715 --> 00:16:20.414
Either way. that is your own journey.

311
00:16:20.414 --> 00:16:22.329
and not one to be heard by the others.

312
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.290
So when does all this start?

313
00:16:28.248 --> 00:16:29.989
First thing in the morning.

314
00:16:31.599 --> 00:16:35.690
And now. I have good news.

315
00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.039
and then. even better news.

316
00:16:45.569 --> 00:16:46.962
Each day. you will be required

317
00:16:46.962 --> 00:16:50.922
to take these mental
enhancers and vitamins.

318
00:16:50.922 --> 00:16:54.274
They will help you to truly
feel the effects of the changes

319
00:16:54.274 --> 00:16:56.058
you're so ready to make.

320
00:16:59.105 --> 00:17:01.498
You need to trust us. if you
want results.

321
00:17:04.414 --> 00:17:05.720
What's the bad news?

322
00:17:07.548 --> 00:17:10.768
Yeah. you said there
was even more good news?

323
00:17:10.768 --> 00:17:12.901
Oh. [laughs] yes.

324
00:17:14.772 --> 00:17:17.949
Tonight. you get to have fun.

325
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:21.040
Introduce yourselves. share stories.

326
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.303
I want you to truly
get to know each other.

327
00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:27.437
Tomorrow. your new life begins.

328
00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:30.788
Hey. where's Daniel?

329
00:17:37.926 --> 00:17:39.232
He wanted to be with his family

330
00:17:39.232 --> 00:17:42.278
more than he wanted to
grow into a new human.

331
00:17:42.278 --> 00:17:43.149
But don't worry.

332
00:17:44.976 --> 00:17:46.587
Those who fail

333
00:17:46.587 --> 00:17:49.024
end up paying for those
whose fees we've waived.

334
00:18:04.126 --> 00:18:05.388
My name is Nicole.

335
00:18:05.388 --> 00:18:08.348
and I'm here to get over some insecurities

336
00:18:08.348 --> 00:18:11.612
and trust issues I've had
stemming from my younger years.

337
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:14.310
My name is Frank.

338
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.966
and I'm here because I
can't stand up for myself.

339
00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:21.404
I'm Lily. and I'd like to

340
00:18:21.404 --> 00:18:23.885
work on a eating disorder that
I've had.

341
00:18:24.799 --> 00:18:26.061
Jesus Christ!

342
00:18:26.757 --> 00:18:27.541
What?

343
00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:28.803
My name's Jesse.

344
00:18:28.803 --> 00:18:30.370
and unlike you three.

345
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.154
I'll actually have the balls
to tell you my real problem.

346
00:18:32.154 --> 00:18:33.503
Hey!

347
00:18:33.503 --> 00:18:34.417
None of you would've come here

348
00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:36.158
if you had these minor issues.

349
00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:42.164
Trust issues?

350
00:18:42.164 --> 00:18:43.557
Go see a shrink.

351
00:18:43.557 --> 00:18:45.820
And you. buy a book on personal power.

352
00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:48.344
Hang on.

353
00:18:48.344 --> 00:18:50.520
Don't assume you know anything
about us.

354
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.434
That's just it.

355
00:18:52.435 --> 00:18:54.176
We're supposed to get to know
each other.

356
00:18:54.176 --> 00:18:55.221
Truly get to know each other.

357
00:18:55.221 --> 00:18:56.831
That's what Elizabeth said.

358
00:18:58.224 --> 00:19:01.879
So Nicole. wanna tell us
why you're really here?

359
00:19:06.493 --> 00:19:08.495
I was raped by my father.

360
00:19:13.195 --> 00:19:14.065
I...

361
00:19:15.066 --> 00:19:15.850
I didn't...

362
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.373
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:17.373 --> 00:19:20.420
There was a time where I
couldn't even say that out loud.

364
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:24.032
But as much as you seem
like an asshole. Jesse.

365
00:19:24.032 --> 00:19:25.251
you're absolutely right.

366
00:19:26.382 --> 00:19:27.514
I'm here to change.

367
00:19:30.473 --> 00:19:32.258
And Elizabeth told us
to share our stories.

368
00:19:32.258 --> 00:19:33.172
So...

369
00:19:34.434 --> 00:19:35.348
What's your story?

370
00:19:42.833 --> 00:19:45.967
I'm here for anxiety and depression.

371
00:19:47.664 --> 00:19:49.013
It may not sound like much.

372
00:19:50.319 --> 00:19:52.930
but

373
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.194
sometimes I can't leave
the house because of it.

374
00:19:56.369 --> 00:19:58.458
I get in a funk. and I
can't get over of it.

375
00:19:59.676 --> 00:20:02.810
My eating disorder is bigger
than just a normal issue.

376
00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:06.683
I can't stop myself.

377
00:20:10.296 --> 00:20:12.515
Well. I've been bullied my
whole life.

378
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.952
When I was 12.

379
00:20:14.952 --> 00:20:17.172
a bully beat me up in
front of the entire school.

380
00:20:18.434 --> 00:20:20.262
and I peed my pants when it happened.

381
00:20:22.133 --> 00:20:24.527
After that. I was known
as Frank the Urinator

382
00:20:24.527 --> 00:20:26.268
for the rest of school.

383
00:20:30.925 --> 00:20:32.709
Go ahead and laugh. guys.

384
00:20:32.709 --> 00:20:33.884
I mean. we are meant to be

385
00:20:33.884 --> 00:20:35.669
gettin' to know each other.
after all.

386
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:37.497
And besides.

387
00:20:37.497 --> 00:20:39.629
I think this booze is startin'
to kick in.

388
00:21:16.405 --> 00:21:19.321
- Everybody okay?

389
00:21:20.453 --> 00:21:22.803
- What the hell is that?

390
00:21:22.803 --> 00:21:25.893
I'm assuming it's a sign to
tell us it's time to go to bed.

391
00:21:25.893 --> 00:21:28.025
No.

392
00:21:33.988 --> 00:21:36.512
Alcohol.

393
00:21:36.512 --> 00:21:39.036
Is this alcohol affecting you?

394
00:21:39.036 --> 00:21:41.735
Yeah.

395
00:21:42.736 --> 00:21:44.390
Am I dreaming this?

396
00:22:58.377 --> 00:23:00.596
Day one. the
followers were given

397
00:23:00.596 --> 00:23:03.425
some kind of drunk cocktail.

398
00:23:03.425 --> 00:23:05.296
which appeared to knock them out.

399
00:23:06.863 --> 00:23:09.431
It was potentially causing hallucinations.

400
00:26:11.352 --> 00:26:13.136
How did you know she'd kill him.

401
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.486
and not the other way around?

402
00:26:16.792 --> 00:26:17.663
We didn't.

403
00:26:18.751 --> 00:26:19.926
So where is Tobin?

404
00:26:19.926 --> 00:26:21.231
Where is he?

405
00:26:21.231 --> 00:26:22.276
Come on. man.

406
00:26:22.276 --> 00:26:24.147
I don't know where he's at.

407
00:26:24.147 --> 00:26:25.758
Oh. come on. man!

408
00:26:25.758 --> 00:26:27.324
Stop bullshitting me.

409
00:26:27.324 --> 00:26:28.499
You know where he is.

410
00:26:28.499 --> 00:26:29.718
Come on. admit it.

411
00:26:29.718 --> 00:26:31.502
He's still running the Vance Institutes.

412
00:26:31.502 --> 00:26:32.721
He's still running this shit.
but from...

413
00:26:32.721 --> 00:26:33.635
He's hiding.

414
00:26:33.635 --> 00:26:34.462
He's in hiding.

415
00:26:34.462 --> 00:26:35.289
But where?

416
00:26:36.203 --> 00:26:38.118
There's reports he's in the UK.

417
00:26:38.118 --> 00:26:39.728
Yeah. in the UK.

418
00:26:39.728 --> 00:26:42.165
And he's still selling this
bullshit as wellness retreats.

419
00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:44.646
That's the reports.

420
00:26:44.646 --> 00:26:46.430
I don't know shit. man.

421
00:27:29.386 --> 00:27:30.866
Good mornin'.

422
00:27:31.911 --> 00:27:32.999
Sleep well?

423
00:27:34.522 --> 00:27:35.828
Yeah.

424
00:27:35.828 --> 00:27:36.916
You?

425
00:27:36.916 --> 00:27:38.395
I passed out.

426
00:27:38.395 --> 00:27:39.396
I did. too.

427
00:27:39.396 --> 00:27:40.702
I know. Frank.

428
00:27:40.702 --> 00:27:42.486
I dragged you to your room.

429
00:27:42.486 --> 00:27:43.923
You seem fine. Jesse?

430
00:27:43.923 --> 00:27:46.012
Yeah. I was hiding it well.

431
00:27:46.969 --> 00:27:50.320
Well. if no one's gonna
come out and say it. I will.

432
00:27:51.757 --> 00:27:52.627
Did they drug us?

433
00:27:53.759 --> 00:27:56.675
We took those pills on their orders.

434
00:27:57.632 --> 00:27:59.678
Maybe mixing them with alcohol
did it?

435
00:28:10.732 --> 00:28:11.994
Good morning.

436
00:28:14.257 --> 00:28:15.998
First light was a little rough. eh?

437
00:28:17.086 --> 00:28:19.088
Maybe you needed to let off some
steam?

438
00:28:19.959 --> 00:28:21.264
That's what you call it?

439
00:28:22.831 --> 00:28:25.834
Did y'all get a
little crazy?

440
00:28:25.834 --> 00:28:28.837
Maybe it was the drugs. Tobin?

441
00:28:28.837 --> 00:28:30.883
Oh. yes. the vitamins we gave you.

442
00:28:31.884 --> 00:28:34.103
Don't worry. they still did
their job.

443
00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:37.106
What the hell does that mean?

444
00:28:37.933 --> 00:28:39.021
The vitamins.

445
00:28:40.196 --> 00:28:42.895
they sometimes have a reaction

446
00:28:42.895 --> 00:28:44.592
with extreme levels of alcohol.

447
00:28:45.506 --> 00:28:46.594
Maybe we should have warned you?

448
00:28:46.594 --> 00:28:48.639
But you are all adults.

449
00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:51.817
I mean. Jesse here. he looks fine.

450
00:28:51.817 --> 00:28:56.473
Well. I've been able to
handle alcohol my whole life.

451
00:28:56.473 --> 00:28:58.171
My family are all big drinkers.

452
00:28:59.215 --> 00:29:00.042
Got it.

453
00:29:02.262 --> 00:29:03.350
How 'bout you. Nicole?

454
00:29:06.179 --> 00:29:07.310
What?

455
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:12.228
I mean. did you have
hallucinations?

456
00:29:12.228 --> 00:29:13.055
No.

457
00:29:13.055 --> 00:29:14.970
No. just a head rush.

458
00:29:16.406 --> 00:29:19.105
You see?

459
00:29:19.105 --> 00:29:20.584
I mean. y'all look tired.

460
00:29:20.584 --> 00:29:23.674
but do any of you have the
classic hangover symptoms.

461
00:29:23.674 --> 00:29:25.067
headache. shaking hands?

462
00:29:25.938 --> 00:29:26.765
You see?

463
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:28.549
The vitamins do work!

464
00:29:29.811 --> 00:29:31.378
Folks. we know all about you.

465
00:29:31.378 --> 00:29:34.033
We know your fears. your
weaknesses. your issues.

466
00:29:34.033 --> 00:29:36.818
your hopes. your dreams.

467
00:29:36.818 --> 00:29:39.734
Elizabeth here has your applications.

468
00:29:39.734 --> 00:29:41.214
And from now on.

469
00:29:41.214 --> 00:29:45.609
the rest of this retreat
will be focused on results.

470
00:29:45.609 --> 00:29:48.525
That's a word I love to use lately.

471
00:29:48.525 --> 00:29:50.963
So last night. y'all needed
to let off some steam.

472
00:29:50.963 --> 00:29:52.312
It's fine!

473
00:29:52.312 --> 00:29:55.837
But now. we have to
start with a clean slate.

474
00:29:55.837 --> 00:29:57.230
The question becomes.

475
00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:01.147
how do we clean that slate
quickly?

476
00:30:03.758 --> 00:30:06.848
And what. are these gonna do
this?

477
00:30:06.848 --> 00:30:08.502
They'll help you focus.

478
00:30:08.502 --> 00:30:09.720
Take them.

479
00:30:12.462 --> 00:30:13.637
You do what I say!

480
00:30:16.858 --> 00:30:18.729
Who's ready to focus?

481
00:30:18.729 --> 00:30:20.340
Now. how did you all feel
when I yelled that way?

482
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.950
That was scary. right?

483
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.560
You reacted.

484
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.129
When you're upset. when you're
angry. depressed. any of it.

485
00:30:27.129 --> 00:30:28.435
that's all you can focus on.

486
00:30:28.435 --> 00:30:29.784
Wouldn't you agree?

487
00:30:29.784 --> 00:30:30.872
Let's say this.

488
00:30:30.872 --> 00:30:32.047
Say you're driving down the road.

489
00:30:32.047 --> 00:30:33.483
and you're living with those emotions.

490
00:30:33.483 --> 00:30:35.659
You're angry. depressed.
sad. something like that.

491
00:30:35.659 --> 00:30:37.487
and a deer runs out.

492
00:30:37.487 --> 00:30:39.881
and runs right into your car.

493
00:30:39.881 --> 00:30:41.143
What happens?

494
00:30:41.143 --> 00:30:42.666
You react.

495
00:30:42.666 --> 00:30:43.972
The adrenaline kicks in.

496
00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:45.931
Exactly.

497
00:30:45.931 --> 00:30:46.801
Good.

498
00:30:46.801 --> 00:30:47.846
Good job. both of you.

499
00:30:48.803 --> 00:30:50.500
Let me ask another question.

500
00:30:51.893 --> 00:30:54.504
When you're dealing with that situation.

501
00:30:54.504 --> 00:30:59.205
what happens to your
anger. your depression.

502
00:30:59.205 --> 00:31:00.859
and your sadness?

503
00:31:02.034 --> 00:31:03.296
They disappear.

504
00:31:03.296 --> 00:31:04.166
Bingo!

505
00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:05.254
Good.

506
00:31:05.254 --> 00:31:06.690
Nicole. good.

507
00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:10.390
All you can focus on in
that moment is the reaction.

508
00:31:15.395 --> 00:31:18.877
Have any of you heard of the
Schmidt's sting pain index?

509
00:31:20.356 --> 00:31:22.097
It's a measure of the amount of pain

510
00:31:22.097 --> 00:31:24.447
given off by an insect bite or sting.

511
00:31:25.492 --> 00:31:27.755
Level one is your basic bee sting.

512
00:31:27.755 --> 00:31:30.540
and it goes all the way up to
level five.

513
00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.848
Level five is shared by three creatures.

514
00:31:33.848 --> 00:31:36.807
the bullet ant. the tarantula hawk.

515
00:31:37.983 --> 00:31:40.376
and these little bad boys right here.

516
00:31:40.376 --> 00:31:42.639
the devil's tooth leech.

517
00:31:42.639 --> 00:31:46.556
This creature transmits
a venom into its victim.

518
00:31:46.556 --> 00:31:47.601
It's excruciating.

519
00:31:48.863 --> 00:31:50.604
It lasts for up to five hours.

520
00:31:50.604 --> 00:31:53.259
but then. it's over.

521
00:31:55.304 --> 00:31:57.872
We are growing.

522
00:32:04.009 --> 00:32:05.575
You were raped.

523
00:32:07.316 --> 00:32:10.537
You are a weak person who's
bullied at every turn.

524
00:32:11.712 --> 00:32:13.932
You suffer from crippling depression.

525
00:32:15.107 --> 00:32:17.761
And you can't say no to
anything. especially food.

526
00:32:18.849 --> 00:32:21.504
Folks. don't shy away from these
issues!

527
00:32:21.504 --> 00:32:22.853
Own them!

528
00:32:22.853 --> 00:32:24.377
Focus on them!

529
00:32:24.377 --> 00:32:25.944
Let them flood your mind.

530
00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:29.034
Close your eyes and do this.

531
00:32:29.034 --> 00:32:29.948
Now...

532
00:32:33.342 --> 00:32:34.953
Are you focusing on your issue?

533
00:32:37.129 --> 00:32:38.521
Yes.

534
00:32:38.521 --> 00:32:39.392
Good.

535
00:32:59.542 --> 00:33:01.805
Please. please. please?

536
00:33:01.805 --> 00:33:02.763
You do what I say!

537
00:33:02.763 --> 00:33:04.721
I will not ask you again!

538
00:33:19.084 --> 00:33:20.607
You think you scare me?

539
00:33:20.607 --> 00:33:21.912
You tell me.

540
00:33:21.912 --> 00:33:24.350
I took a bullet to the
shoulder once.

541
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:25.481
Oh. yeah?

542
00:33:25.481 --> 00:33:26.352
Where was that?

543
00:33:35.796 --> 00:33:37.450
I can't.

544
00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.321
I can't.

545
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:41.062
You say yes to everything else.

546
00:33:41.062 --> 00:33:42.803
and you're gonna say no to this?

547
00:33:42.803 --> 00:33:44.500
Are you crazy?

548
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.980
What the hell lesson is this
teaching us?

549
00:33:46.894 --> 00:33:49.505
You obviously weren't
listening.

550
00:33:49.505 --> 00:33:50.898
No!

551
00:33:50.898 --> 00:33:52.682
No. I won't do this!

552
00:33:52.682 --> 00:33:54.380
No-

553
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:10.091
Now. who's still thinking
about their problems?

554
00:34:22.712 --> 00:34:24.845
Pretty intense first day. huh?

555
00:34:24.845 --> 00:34:26.020
I'd say so.

556
00:34:27.413 --> 00:34:28.979
What the fuck was that?

557
00:34:28.979 --> 00:34:31.243
No way was I letting that
fuckin' thing sting me!

558
00:34:31.243 --> 00:34:34.376
Listen. they're just trying
it to get inside your head.

559
00:34:34.376 --> 00:34:36.074
Of course they're tryin'
to get inside our heads!

560
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:37.640
That's the reason we're here!

561
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.207
I'll be honest.

562
00:34:39.207 --> 00:34:40.339
I feel great!

563
00:34:41.905 --> 00:34:43.907
- What?

564
00:34:43.907 --> 00:34:45.909
I faced a challenge!

565
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:48.347
I didn't back down!

566
00:34:48.347 --> 00:34:50.610
You know how long it's been
since I tried something

567
00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.351
and I was successful?

568
00:34:53.526 --> 00:34:55.484
You call that success?

569
00:34:56.877 --> 00:34:59.271
Is there any other way to
perceive it?

570
00:34:59.271 --> 00:35:01.186
Well. what was it for?

571
00:35:01.186 --> 00:35:02.491
To fuck with us.

572
00:35:07.061 --> 00:35:08.149
No!

573
00:35:12.632 --> 00:35:13.850
To clear our minds.

574
00:35:15.809 --> 00:35:16.679
I don't know about you.

575
00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:18.899
but my mind is clear.

576
00:35:23.817 --> 00:35:25.123
Whatever you say. man.

577
00:35:28.909 --> 00:35:31.651
Let's just see how tomorrow goes.

578
00:35:39.528 --> 00:35:41.269
You should embrace this training.

579
00:35:42.662 --> 00:35:44.098
Training?

580
00:35:44.098 --> 00:35:47.449
I'm not gonna take a fuckin'
bite from a giant leech!

581
00:35:47.449 --> 00:35:50.670
I'm not crazy.

582
00:36:22.484 --> 00:36:24.356
No!

583
00:36:42.939 --> 00:36:44.202
Good morning.

584
00:36:45.507 --> 00:36:47.944
Let's get started on day two.

585
00:36:49.294 --> 00:36:50.643
Shouldn't we...

586
00:36:50.643 --> 00:36:52.253
Shouldn't we wait for Lily?

587
00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:56.388
Lily is on her own path for now.

588
00:37:15.363 --> 00:37:16.234
Hey.

589
00:37:18.148 --> 00:37:19.498
Oh. hi.

590
00:37:19.498 --> 00:37:21.804
You're-
- The guy from the speech.

591
00:37:22.718 --> 00:37:25.286
Elizabeth gave me a call and
said I was back in the program.

592
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.421
You gotta be kidding me?

593
00:37:29.421 --> 00:37:30.291
What?

594
00:37:32.946 --> 00:37:34.600
I guess I'm being kicked out.

595
00:37:35.731 --> 00:37:36.645
What do you mean?

596
00:37:37.603 --> 00:37:40.170
I failed to do the exercise yesterday.

597
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.911
and I was punished last night.

598
00:37:41.911 --> 00:37:43.957
and now I'm gone.

599
00:37:43.957 --> 00:37:48.004
Hey. nobody told me I was
replacing anybody. okay?

600
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:51.094
I mean. did somebody talk to
you?

601
00:37:52.574 --> 00:37:53.401
No.

602
00:37:56.404 --> 00:37:57.492
They just tortured me.

603
00:37:58.711 --> 00:38:00.800
Yesterday. Tobin challenged us
to get bit

604
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.715
by this devil's tooth leech thing.

605
00:38:05.065 --> 00:38:06.284
I refused.

606
00:38:07.502 --> 00:38:10.505
And last night. I woke up tied
to my bed.

607
00:38:10.505 --> 00:38:12.028
and there were a dozen on me.

608
00:38:12.942 --> 00:38:13.769
Holy shit!

609
00:38:15.075 --> 00:38:16.294
I mean. were you bitten?

610
00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:19.645
So many times that I blacked out.

611
00:38:19.645 --> 00:38:20.515
Wow!

612
00:38:23.213 --> 00:38:25.912
I bet it was hard to focus on anything

613
00:38:27.696 --> 00:38:28.958
while that was happening?

614
00:38:31.396 --> 00:38:33.136
You sound just like Tobin.

615
00:38:34.834 --> 00:38:35.835
I do.

616
00:38:35.835 --> 00:38:38.316
Well. hey. okay. I'm just

617
00:38:39.273 --> 00:38:42.145
trying to figure out what
the lesson is in there.

618
00:38:42.145 --> 00:38:43.364
Whatever.

619
00:38:43.364 --> 00:38:45.366
I guess that's why I'm being
kicked out?

620
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:47.847
Hey.

621
00:38:49.544 --> 00:38:50.415
You're still here.

622
00:38:52.025 --> 00:38:54.027
Hey. I don't see any bags packed.

623
00:38:56.421 --> 00:38:58.205
What's your name again?

624
00:38:58.205 --> 00:38:59.075
John.

625
00:39:00.076 --> 00:39:00.947
I'm Lily.

626
00:39:02.165 --> 00:39:05.038
It's nice to meet you again.

627
00:39:06.126 --> 00:39:07.214
You know. John.

628
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:10.696
I don't know.

629
00:39:13.046 --> 00:39:16.266
maybe in some sick way I
needed that last night?

630
00:39:17.311 --> 00:39:19.792
But honestly. when those
bugs were biting me.

631
00:39:20.967 --> 00:39:22.316
you were right.

632
00:39:24.492 --> 00:39:27.190
There was nothing else
on my mind except for...

633
00:39:29.541 --> 00:39:30.672
Surviving.

634
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.329
And maybe that was Tobin's
lesson?

635
00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:38.201
I guess.

636
00:39:39.768 --> 00:39:41.640
And nobody's asked you
to leave?

637
00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:45.121
Nobody.

638
00:39:45.121 --> 00:39:46.558
Then I'm sure you're still in.

639
00:39:48.473 --> 00:39:53.434
And you can beat this eating disorder.

640
00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.394
I never told you that's
what I was here for.

641
00:39:58.918 --> 00:39:59.832
I'm sorry.

642
00:39:59.832 --> 00:40:01.050
I was just...

643
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:01.964
I was makin' a guess.

644
00:40:01.964 --> 00:40:04.445
I'm so fucking insensitive!

645
00:40:04.445 --> 00:40:05.533
So fucking [mumbles]!

646
00:40:05.533 --> 00:40:06.621
What the fuck is wrong with
you?!

647
00:40:06.621 --> 00:40:07.622
You're just so fucking
insensitive!

648
00:40:07.622 --> 00:40:09.058
Just lose your fuckin' shit.

649
00:40:09.058 --> 00:40:10.582
and you just fuckin' say
something like that?!

650
00:40:10.582 --> 00:40:11.670
Fuck.

651
00:40:13.236 --> 00:40:14.673
When you want something in life.

652
00:40:14.673 --> 00:40:16.414
you can't wait for it to come to you.

653
00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:17.893
'cause it never will.

654
00:40:17.893 --> 00:40:20.287
Imagine if I had a rabbit right here.

655
00:40:20.287 --> 00:40:23.595
what would be the first
thought that came to your mind?

656
00:40:23.595 --> 00:40:25.510
Don't mind if that thing bites
us?

657
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:28.904
The essence
of a rabbit is to run.

658
00:40:28.904 --> 00:40:31.211
It runs to its next survival spot.

659
00:40:31.211 --> 00:40:34.475
You need to have this essence.

660
00:40:34.475 --> 00:40:35.433
Do you understand?

661
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:38.305
I don't.

662
00:40:38.305 --> 00:40:40.307
That's fine.

663
00:40:40.307 --> 00:40:42.962
Nicole. let me make it as
simple as possible for you.

664
00:40:42.962 --> 00:40:46.487
What if I told you there was a
rabbit here on these grounds.

665
00:40:46.487 --> 00:40:48.489
and if you could find the rabbit.

666
00:40:48.489 --> 00:40:51.710
the rabbit was your issue.
and you could catch it.

667
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.625
would you try to catch it?

668
00:40:53.625 --> 00:40:55.191
Yes.

669
00:40:55.191 --> 00:40:58.934
Then when you caught it.
what would you do with it?

670
00:40:58.934 --> 00:41:00.283
Let me guess.

671
00:41:00.283 --> 00:41:03.896
You're asking us to find
and kill this rabbit?

672
00:41:03.896 --> 00:41:05.288
Is that what you think?

673
00:41:06.725 --> 00:41:09.815
You think a simple rabbit
hunt will solve your problems?

674
00:41:10.859 --> 00:41:12.557
There's no stakes there.

675
00:41:12.557 --> 00:41:14.341
I don't think that'll do anything.

676
00:41:15.603 --> 00:41:17.518
Then what's the game?

677
00:41:17.518 --> 00:41:18.606
"The game?"

678
00:41:18.606 --> 00:41:19.520
There's no game.

679
00:41:20.782 --> 00:41:21.609
This is life.

680
00:41:22.828 --> 00:41:23.872
This is survival.

681
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:28.442
How are y'all feeling?

682
00:41:32.664 --> 00:41:35.057
Those pills you just
took weren't vitamins.

683
00:41:35.057 --> 00:41:37.016
They're a fast acting poison.

684
00:41:37.016 --> 00:41:39.061
You'll all be dead within 20 minutes.

685
00:41:39.061 --> 00:41:40.062
You're jokin' with us!

686
00:41:41.194 --> 00:41:42.543
What the fuck?!

687
00:41:42.543 --> 00:41:45.503
I assure you. your death is imminent.

688
00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:48.244
unless-
- What do we need to do?!

689
00:41:48.244 --> 00:41:50.769
You can use these trackers
and find the rabbit.

690
00:41:50.769 --> 00:41:53.249
The rabbit has the antidote in
its blood.

691
00:41:54.163 --> 00:41:54.990
Catch it.

692
00:41:55.948 --> 00:41:57.036
and you live.

693
00:43:24.993 --> 00:43:26.952
- Move!

694
00:44:14.782 --> 00:44:16.392
Instead of anger.

695
00:44:16.392 --> 00:44:18.394
let's focus on relief.

696
00:44:18.394 --> 00:44:21.136
The fear of death changes most.

697
00:44:22.355 --> 00:44:25.097
How will it change you?

698
00:44:36.195 --> 00:44:38.284
I wanna get the fuck out of here.

699
00:44:38.284 --> 00:44:40.112
Likewise.

700
00:44:40.112 --> 00:44:41.287
And why is that?

701
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:45.683
Tobin tried to kill us out there.

702
00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:46.814
What?

703
00:44:46.814 --> 00:44:47.772
How?

704
00:44:47.772 --> 00:44:49.599
He fucking poisoned us.

705
00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:50.513
Focus!

706
00:44:50.513 --> 00:44:52.690
I'll ask a simple question.

707
00:44:54.082 --> 00:44:55.083
Do you want to stay?

708
00:44:56.389 --> 00:44:57.564
Fuck no.

709
00:44:57.564 --> 00:44:59.914
I want to.

710
00:44:59.914 --> 00:45:02.525
Lily. do you want to stay?

711
00:45:03.788 --> 00:45:06.355
I'd like to keep going
and see where we're headed.

712
00:45:06.355 --> 00:45:07.400
Jesse?

713
00:45:08.575 --> 00:45:10.708
Not 100% sure.

714
00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:11.709
Yes or no!

715
00:45:13.493 --> 00:45:15.843
If you'd let me finish.

716
00:45:15.843 --> 00:45:19.760
I was going to say. I'm not 100%
sure...

717
00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.067
But. yes.

718
00:45:25.374 --> 00:45:28.464
After you got poisoned today?

719
00:45:28.464 --> 00:45:30.118
Yet. you are all still here.

720
00:45:31.206 --> 00:45:33.556
Because of the antidote.

721
00:45:33.556 --> 00:45:36.081
Yes. there was some danger.

722
00:45:36.081 --> 00:45:37.822
but that wasn't all that happened.

723
00:45:39.171 --> 00:45:40.520
What I saw was victory.

724
00:45:42.261 --> 00:45:43.088
Don't you see?

725
00:45:44.002 --> 00:45:46.569
You all came here with
such massive problems.

726
00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:49.834
and in just two short days.

727
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:52.967
where are your problems now?

728
00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:57.842
You're all free to leave anytime.

729
00:45:58.843 --> 00:45:59.931
but you know the deal.

730
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:05.240
You'll owe us the $75.000
for the treatment.

731
00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.503
So you're just gonna
keep us here to blackmail?

732
00:46:07.503 --> 00:46:10.028
No. Frank. we're only
honoring the agreement

733
00:46:10.028 --> 00:46:12.421
that you freely entered into.

734
00:46:13.422 --> 00:46:14.597
Where is this going?

735
00:46:16.556 --> 00:46:20.778
Each day has gotten worse.
and worse. and worse.

736
00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:22.910
But you've got so much better!

737
00:46:25.086 --> 00:46:26.696
I know this is hard to believe.

738
00:46:28.002 --> 00:46:30.309
but if you trust the process.

739
00:46:31.353 --> 00:46:32.964
you will see results.

740
00:46:34.704 --> 00:46:37.359
I'm not takin' another fuckin'
vitamin!

741
00:46:37.359 --> 00:46:38.230
Yeah.

742
00:46:39.057 --> 00:46:40.014
Me neither.

743
00:46:41.015 --> 00:46:43.496
Fine. I'll eliminate that.

744
00:46:47.979 --> 00:46:48.806
Are we good?

745
00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:51.983
I wanna give this my all.

746
00:46:54.681 --> 00:46:57.249
Yeah. I guess I'll stay here.

747
00:47:00.426 --> 00:47:03.385
I can't.

748
00:47:03.385 --> 00:47:05.866
We'll continue
the program tomorrow.

749
00:47:09.609 --> 00:47:13.439
Day three. Tobin made us
swallow a poisoned pill.

750
00:47:14.396 --> 00:47:17.704
I'll wait until the time is
right to make the arrest.

751
00:47:17.704 --> 00:47:19.793
Hoping to avoid any damage.

752
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.191
Hey.

753
00:47:27.627 --> 00:47:28.454
Jesse. right?

754
00:47:30.586 --> 00:47:31.413
And you are?

755
00:47:33.328 --> 00:47:34.155
John.

756
00:47:36.201 --> 00:47:37.767
We met at the speech.

757
00:47:41.293 --> 00:47:42.120
That's right.

758
00:47:43.338 --> 00:47:45.340
What are you doing here?

759
00:47:48.735 --> 00:47:49.562
Tobin called.

760
00:47:50.432 --> 00:47:51.433
said I was back in.

761
00:48:06.971 --> 00:48:07.797
Hey. man.

762
00:48:10.365 --> 00:48:11.192
I'm a friend.

763
00:48:13.673 --> 00:48:15.240
I don't know what your issue is.

764
00:48:19.766 --> 00:48:22.725
Clearly. mine is boundaries.

765
00:48:25.337 --> 00:48:26.338
Personal space.

766
00:50:18.406 --> 00:50:21.061
Whatever we all thought
this was. it's not.

767
00:50:21.061 --> 00:50:23.194
What are you talkin' about?

768
00:50:23.194 --> 00:50:25.370
What the fuck do you
think she's talkin' about?

769
00:50:26.458 --> 00:50:30.288
The drugs. the poison. the manipulation.

770
00:50:30.288 --> 00:50:31.550
It's a maze out there.

771
00:50:33.595 --> 00:50:34.814
Are you fuckin' blind?

772
00:50:36.337 --> 00:50:38.861
Oh. wait. you didn't have
to experience any of this.

773
00:50:38.861 --> 00:50:39.993
did you. Lily?

774
00:50:42.082 --> 00:50:43.562
I did.

775
00:50:43.562 --> 00:50:45.042
What are you talking about?

776
00:50:45.042 --> 00:50:45.999
The leeches.

777
00:50:47.566 --> 00:50:48.436
No.

778
00:50:48.436 --> 00:50:49.655
No. no. you bailed on that.

779
00:50:49.655 --> 00:50:51.048
You didn't have the guts.

780
00:50:51.048 --> 00:50:53.398
Maybe so. but that night after
I bailed.

781
00:50:55.139 --> 00:50:57.184
I woke up tied to the bed.

782
00:50:58.794 --> 00:50:59.795
and they were all over me.

783
00:50:59.795 --> 00:51:01.928
- You see?!
- What?

784
00:51:01.928 --> 00:51:04.322
You didn't sign up to be tied
down!

785
00:51:04.322 --> 00:51:07.629
I didn't sign up to have
my fucking life threatened.

786
00:51:07.629 --> 00:51:09.805
or have to eat a live fuckin'
bunny.

787
00:51:11.938 --> 00:51:13.287
Yes. Jesse.

788
00:51:13.287 --> 00:51:14.636
but I'd be lying if I didn't
admit

789
00:51:14.636 --> 00:51:16.856
that I understood the lesson.

790
00:51:16.856 --> 00:51:17.944
I mean...

791
00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:23.210
Oh!

792
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:24.690
I mean. I get it!

793
00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:28.911
Like. sure. I expected like hallucinogens.

794
00:51:28.911 --> 00:51:31.088
or mushrooms. or somethin'.

795
00:51:31.088 --> 00:51:33.090
Okay. guys. it's been pretty extreme.

796
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:36.354
but this is Tobin Vance!

797
00:51:36.354 --> 00:51:38.095
Tobin-fucking-Vance. indeed!

798
00:51:38.095 --> 00:51:40.053
Okay. even at the initial
conference where we all met.

799
00:51:40.053 --> 00:51:41.663
what did he say?

800
00:51:41.663 --> 00:51:42.969
"Results."

801
00:51:45.189 --> 00:51:47.365
He promised results!

802
00:51:47.365 --> 00:51:50.846
If your baby was dying.
and he had a solution.

803
00:51:50.846 --> 00:51:53.458
would you care what he
did if he got results?

804
00:51:53.458 --> 00:51:54.850
- Well-
- No!

805
00:51:54.850 --> 00:51:56.374
No. you fucking wouldn't!

806
00:51:57.592 --> 00:51:59.246
Well. guess what?

807
00:51:59.246 --> 00:52:01.770
It's not your babies that are dying.

808
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:03.250
It's you.

809
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:04.469
It's us!

810
00:52:05.383 --> 00:52:07.776
We're fucking dying out here.

811
00:52:07.776 --> 00:52:10.562
and he is offering us a
second chance at life!

812
00:52:12.999 --> 00:52:15.436
I know I haven't been here
for the intense stuff.

813
00:52:16.437 --> 00:52:17.743
but I'm fucking ready!

814
00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.183
And Elizabeth says that
you're all rock stars?

815
00:52:24.097 --> 00:52:27.448
I am honored to go on
this journey with you.

816
00:52:34.107 --> 00:52:35.195
He's good.

817
00:52:37.502 --> 00:52:38.459
We'll see.

818
00:52:41.723 --> 00:52:42.724
Mask.

819
00:52:51.907 --> 00:52:54.997
And then I started hearing
all these weird stories.

820
00:52:54.997 --> 00:52:57.043
I mean. really weird stories about

821
00:52:57.043 --> 00:53:01.308
these extreme wellness retreats.

822
00:53:01.308 --> 00:53:02.570
Extreme.

823
00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:07.053
So when did it all start
to unravel for you?

824
00:53:07.053 --> 00:53:09.403
For me. it was the
experimental retreats.

825
00:53:10.404 --> 00:53:12.754
They became too violent.

826
00:53:12.754 --> 00:53:14.321
and-
- Violent?

827
00:53:14.321 --> 00:53:15.540
Too militant.

828
00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:16.758
and-
- Militant.

829
00:53:16.758 --> 00:53:19.239
Everyone was trying to outdo
each other

830
00:53:19.239 --> 00:53:21.459
to get to the top of the organization.

831
00:53:21.459 --> 00:53:23.591
The top being Tobin.

832
00:53:23.591 --> 00:53:24.984
Tobin Vance!

833
00:53:26.028 --> 00:53:26.855
Right?

834
00:53:28.074 --> 00:53:30.337
Thank you all for making it
this far.

835
00:53:30.337 --> 00:53:31.947
Today's exercise is a variation of

836
00:53:31.947 --> 00:53:34.994
something called family constellations.

837
00:53:34.994 --> 00:53:37.475
John here has been
through a lot in his life.

838
00:53:37.475 --> 00:53:39.085
so we're gonna aid him

839
00:53:39.085 --> 00:53:41.653
by guiding him through
a moment in his history.

840
00:53:41.653 --> 00:53:43.568
taking on the traits of his family.

841
00:53:43.568 --> 00:53:44.786
John. do you understand?

842
00:53:47.006 --> 00:53:48.964
Yeah. I think.

843
00:53:49.878 --> 00:53:51.837
You simply go to each
member of the group

844
00:53:51.837 --> 00:53:54.405
and assign them a role in your family.

845
00:53:54.405 --> 00:53:57.625
and then we'll improvise a
moment from your childhood.

846
00:53:58.931 --> 00:54:00.759
John. assign each member

847
00:54:00.759 --> 00:54:03.022
of the group a role from your family.

848
00:54:03.022 --> 00:54:04.328
and then let's begin.

849
00:54:12.901 --> 00:54:14.990
The first memory I have of my family.

850
00:54:16.644 --> 00:54:19.038
I was in my room.

851
00:54:20.474 --> 00:54:21.780
and I heard a noise.

852
00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:26.524
yelling. screaming. pleading.

853
00:54:28.047 --> 00:54:30.310
And when I went to find
out what had happened.

854
00:54:32.573 --> 00:54:34.053
my sister was in the corner.

855
00:54:35.837 --> 00:54:37.317
She didn't have any pants on.

856
00:54:39.754 --> 00:54:42.061
My mother was hitting her.

857
00:54:43.105 --> 00:54:45.194
slapping her. cursing at her.

858
00:54:47.284 --> 00:54:50.025
Quiet. you pathetic. little
ingrate!

859
00:54:50.025 --> 00:54:52.027
Please. Mommy. please. no!

860
00:54:52.027 --> 00:54:55.509
Wait until I tell your father.

861
00:54:55.509 --> 00:54:59.208
My father was putting his
clothes on.

862
00:54:59.208 --> 00:55:03.256
The cunt. the filthy fucking rapist.

863
00:55:06.564 --> 00:55:10.089
Jesse. you play me.

864
00:55:12.613 --> 00:55:14.311
and walk in.

865
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:15.747
This is fucked!

866
00:55:18.358 --> 00:55:20.578
Let's do this...

867
00:55:20.578 --> 00:55:21.448
For John.

868
00:55:24.843 --> 00:55:26.323
I can't do this.

869
00:55:27.411 --> 00:55:29.064
I can't hurt anyone.

870
00:55:29.891 --> 00:55:31.850
But you did. you did.

871
00:55:34.766 --> 00:55:38.770
You raped my sister.

872
00:55:40.989 --> 00:55:44.993
You beat my mother.

873
00:55:47.822 --> 00:55:49.824
And you did stuff to me.

874
00:55:50.695 --> 00:55:51.696
You monster!

875
00:55:54.699 --> 00:55:56.440
You think. wee man?

876
00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:59.007
Just wait.

877
00:56:01.662 --> 00:56:04.665
I'll show ya a real fucking monster.

878
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:09.104
[sobs] Daddy.
please don't hurt him!

879
00:56:09.104 --> 00:56:12.020
Please. Daddy. don't hurt him!

880
00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.631
Come on. Dad.

881
00:56:13.631 --> 00:56:16.024
Show me what you got.

882
00:56:16.024 --> 00:56:18.810
I will fucking destroy you!

883
00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:22.248
- Good. Frank.

884
00:56:22.248 --> 00:56:23.075
How do you feel?

885
00:56:23.075 --> 00:56:23.945
Do you feel powerful?

886
00:56:25.469 --> 00:56:26.339
Yeah.

887
00:56:27.253 --> 00:56:28.907
Big man hittin' women.

888
00:56:29.777 --> 00:56:32.258
Jesse. walk in and ask what's
happening.

889
00:56:32.258 --> 00:56:33.564
What's happening?

890
00:56:33.564 --> 00:56:34.913
Nothing's happened dear.

891
00:56:35.783 --> 00:56:37.089
I just hurt myself again.

892
00:56:38.612 --> 00:56:39.918
I'm just clumsy.

893
00:56:40.919 --> 00:56:41.833
Go to bed now.

894
00:56:43.008 --> 00:56:45.140
I'll tuck your sister into bed.

895
00:56:47.404 --> 00:56:49.057
You monster!

896
00:56:49.057 --> 00:56:51.190
You fucking monster!

897
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:52.974
You are this.

898
00:56:52.974 --> 00:56:54.585
You are sick!

899
00:56:54.585 --> 00:56:56.195
You are deranged!

900
00:56:57.762 --> 00:57:01.069
I'll show you the biggest
man you've ever fucking seen!

901
00:57:02.244 --> 00:57:04.421
I will fucking devour you!

902
00:57:08.729 --> 00:57:10.557
Don't!

903
00:57:13.212 --> 00:57:15.170
Frank. stop!

904
00:57:20.524 --> 00:57:21.655
No!

905
00:57:25.311 --> 00:57:26.530
What?

906
00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:27.748
What did I do?

907
00:57:29.794 --> 00:57:32.318
Perspective. ladies and gentlemen.

908
00:57:32.318 --> 00:57:36.801
Good. bad. ugly. it's humanity.

909
00:57:36.801 --> 00:57:38.498
It's disgusting!

910
00:57:39.717 --> 00:57:41.153
It's painful.

911
00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:44.199
but it's manageable.

912
00:57:44.199 --> 00:57:49.248
if we can explore how it
unfolds. and how we perceive it.

913
00:57:49.596 --> 00:57:51.685
What is going through
your body right now?!

914
00:57:54.079 --> 00:57:56.168
I'm scared.

915
00:57:56.168 --> 00:57:57.474
Scared of who?

916
00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.389
Scared of you.

917
00:58:02.087 --> 00:58:03.610
Expand on that.

918
00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:04.829
Scared of who?

919
00:58:06.221 --> 00:58:07.919
You're scared of your father.

920
00:58:07.919 --> 00:58:09.660
Yeah.

921
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:11.618
You inhabited him very well. huh?

922
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.579
[sobs] I don't
know what the fuck.

923
00:58:18.451 --> 00:58:22.542
Frank. did you feel powerful

924
00:58:22.542 --> 00:58:25.327
when you were telling
everyone else what to do?

925
00:58:28.722 --> 00:58:30.985
- Maybe.
- No. no. no. maybe!

926
00:58:30.985 --> 00:58:31.812
Okay?

927
00:58:31.812 --> 00:58:34.598
Yes. strength and power!

928
00:58:35.947 --> 00:58:38.210
I want you to hold onto those things.

929
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:39.516
It wasn't for the right reasons.

930
00:58:39.516 --> 00:58:40.691
but you hold onto them.

931
00:58:40.691 --> 00:58:41.822
Frank. look at me!

932
00:58:41.822 --> 00:58:44.303
Look at me.

933
00:58:44.303 --> 00:58:45.478
Okay?

934
00:58:45.478 --> 00:58:48.176
Strength. power. courage. initiative.

935
00:58:48.176 --> 00:58:49.438
You are not your father.

936
00:58:50.352 --> 00:58:53.268
but you can take his best qualities

937
00:58:53.268 --> 00:58:55.619
and keep your moral compass.

938
00:59:03.801 --> 00:59:06.760
I felt like I was
turning into someone else.

939
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:09.546
You were experiencing the
emotions of John's sister.

940
00:59:11.504 --> 00:59:13.637
Telepathy is real. folks.

941
00:59:14.681 --> 00:59:17.945
It exists when we let others
inside our experiences.

942
00:59:17.945 --> 00:59:19.817
but we can't let everyone in.

943
00:59:21.819 --> 00:59:22.820
How'd they do. John?

944
00:59:24.256 --> 00:59:25.431
I hate them.

945
00:59:28.042 --> 00:59:29.653
I hate them.

946
00:59:29.653 --> 00:59:32.351
but I understand them now.

947
00:59:33.787 --> 00:59:36.050
I think we all learned
a lesson here today.

948
00:59:46.713 --> 00:59:47.932
Please exit the hall.

949
00:59:47.932 --> 00:59:49.150
We're finished for now.

950
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:54.155
I highly recommend a nap
before the next stage.

951
00:59:54.155 --> 00:59:57.071
Food and drinks will be brought
to your rooms momentarily.

952
00:59:58.203 --> 01:00:01.119
This exercise is so emotionally draining.

953
01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:02.990
you may feel a bit strange.

954
01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:06.994
so I would like you to
eat and drink everything.

955
01:00:06.994 --> 01:00:09.910
as you'll need all the calories
to replenish your energy.

956
01:00:14.828 --> 01:00:15.960
I can see the worry.

957
01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:18.440
the fear of anticipation.

958
01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.660
but today is simple.

959
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.140
Shooting.

960
01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:23.576
Riflery.

961
01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:25.186
When the world is holding you back.

962
01:00:25.186 --> 01:00:27.667
you need to focus your aim on
your goal.

963
01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:29.626
so that when life propels you forward.

964
01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.236
you can hit your target.

965
01:00:31.236 --> 01:00:34.021
There's something so simple
about picking up a rifle.

966
01:00:34.021 --> 01:00:36.284
pointing at your target.
setting your sights.

967
01:00:36.284 --> 01:00:38.025
and then. bam.

968
01:00:38.025 --> 01:00:39.026
hitting the target.

969
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:43.204
Today. I
need your energy up. folks.

970
01:00:44.162 --> 01:00:47.078
There'll be no more vitamins or pills.

971
01:00:47.078 --> 01:00:48.253
Or poison?

972
01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:51.822
Or poison.

973
01:00:51.822 --> 01:00:55.652
Just pure adrenaline for a
simple task.

974
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.566
Each of you will pick up a rifle.

975
01:00:57.566 --> 01:00:59.351
and point it at that target.

976
01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:00.961
and that target is your issue.

977
01:01:00.961 --> 01:01:03.660
and the bullet is your energy.

978
01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.139
I want you to flood your mind.

979
01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:06.097
Focus. truly!

980
01:01:06.097 --> 01:01:08.273
When that is filling your mind.

981
01:01:08.273 --> 01:01:09.883
your issue is in your mind.

982
01:01:09.883 --> 01:01:11.232
that's all you can focus on.

983
01:01:11.232 --> 01:01:12.233
then you pull the trigger.

984
01:01:12.233 --> 01:01:15.280
and you destroy that problem!

985
01:01:16.194 --> 01:01:17.021
Simple enough?

986
01:01:18.283 --> 01:01:19.676
Anyone shot a rifle before?

987
01:01:20.764 --> 01:01:21.634
I have.

988
01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.289
Good.

989
01:01:24.289 --> 01:01:26.813
John.

990
01:01:26.813 --> 01:01:27.814
Good.

991
01:01:27.814 --> 01:01:29.163
Now. breathe.

992
01:01:30.251 --> 01:01:31.862
Focus.

993
01:01:31.862 --> 01:01:32.732
Okay.

994
01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:34.734
That target is your problem.

995
01:01:34.734 --> 01:01:37.432
and that bullet is your energy.

996
01:01:37.432 --> 01:01:40.653
When you are ready. you let it go.

997
01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:48.574
Great!

998
01:01:48.574 --> 01:01:50.228
John. how do you feel?

999
01:01:50.228 --> 01:01:51.751
I feel freakin' amazing.

1000
01:01:53.666 --> 01:01:56.625
Frank. you're next.

1001
01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:00.412
Try again.

1002
01:02:06.766 --> 01:02:07.680
Great!

1003
01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.465
Lily. you're next.

1004
01:02:10.465 --> 01:02:11.336
Focus.

1005
01:02:14.469 --> 01:02:16.123
Try again.

1006
01:02:24.653 --> 01:02:25.742
Don't disappoint me.

1007
01:02:31.399 --> 01:02:32.313
Jesse. you're up.

1008
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:44.499
Amazing!

1009
01:02:44.499 --> 01:02:46.763
Jesse. where did you
learn to shoot like that?

1010
01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.242
Boy Scouts.

1011
01:02:48.242 --> 01:02:51.289
Wow. I didn't know they
had rifles in Boy Scouts?

1012
01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:52.159
I'm glad.

1013
01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:56.250
Piece of cake.

1014
01:02:57.382 --> 01:02:58.426
Well. hang on then.

1015
01:02:59.427 --> 01:03:01.168
Maybe this is all a little too
easy?

1016
01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:13.398
What the hell is this?

1017
01:03:14.486 --> 01:03:16.793
This?

1018
01:03:17.706 --> 01:03:20.666
This is a pig who raped three women.

1019
01:03:20.666 --> 01:03:23.016
Let's welcome Henry to our
little party.

1020
01:03:23.016 --> 01:03:23.974
Hang on.

1021
01:03:23.974 --> 01:03:26.063
No. no. you hang on!

1022
01:03:26.063 --> 01:03:27.934
You make a choice right now.

1023
01:03:29.283 --> 01:03:31.285
Don't think. react.

1024
01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:35.681
You can hit the target. or
you can hit the pig rapist!

1025
01:03:35.681 --> 01:03:36.813
No. we have to

1026
01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.466
call the police.
- Stand down. Jesse!

1027
01:03:38.466 --> 01:03:39.554
Fuck you!

1028
01:03:39.554 --> 01:03:40.512
If Nicole does that-

1029
01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:41.687
No one moves!

1030
01:03:45.212 --> 01:03:46.387
Your choice.

1031
01:03:47.432 --> 01:03:48.607
Killer.

1032
01:03:58.051 --> 01:03:59.748
Come on. don't do this!

1033
01:03:59.748 --> 01:04:02.273
- You're not a killer!

1034
01:04:02.273 --> 01:04:05.276
You don't fuckin' know me.

1035
01:04:09.149 --> 01:04:09.976
One more.

1036
01:04:09.976 --> 01:04:11.282
No. Nicole. stand down.

1037
01:04:12.761 --> 01:04:14.285
Let her do it.

1038
01:04:14.285 --> 01:04:15.590
What did you say?

1039
01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:17.331
I said. "Let her do it!"

1040
01:04:17.331 --> 01:04:18.985
You don't make the rules here. John.

1041
01:04:18.985 --> 01:04:21.074
I'd watch myself. if I were you.

1042
01:04:21.074 --> 01:04:22.946
Day four is over.

1043
01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:24.338
Let's go back to the cabin.

1044
01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.559
- Hey.

1045
01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:31.345
So you don't have the
balls to finish him off?

1046
01:04:31.345 --> 01:04:32.216
John...

1047
01:04:34.696 --> 01:04:37.743
Let me show you how it's done.

1048
01:04:37.743 --> 01:04:40.789
- John?

1049
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:43.401
- No. don't do it!
- No!

1050
01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:50.277
- Yeah!

1051
01:04:50.277 --> 01:04:52.236
- Out of my way.
- Jesse.

1052
01:05:03.073 --> 01:05:05.118
Bro. what are you doing?

1053
01:05:08.861 --> 01:05:10.515
Jesse. wait!

1054
01:05:10.515 --> 01:05:12.125
Everybody stay back!

1055
01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:13.953
- What are you doin'. Jesse?
- We've got a situation here.

1056
01:05:13.953 --> 01:05:15.868
A fuckin' murder!

1057
01:05:15.868 --> 01:05:17.174
It's you.

1058
01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:23.832
A man just got murdered.

1059
01:05:23.832 --> 01:05:25.965
and shit is about to go down.

1060
01:05:25.965 --> 01:05:27.314
I'm a police officer.

1061
01:05:27.314 --> 01:05:28.402
Do you understand me?

1062
01:05:38.195 --> 01:05:39.370
Okay. so these people
who sign up

1063
01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:40.893
a bit skeptical. wouldn't they.

1064
01:05:40.893 --> 01:05:42.329
in light of what's goin' on?

1065
01:05:44.288 --> 01:05:45.811
He's convincing.

1066
01:05:45.811 --> 01:05:46.986
He's what?

1067
01:05:46.986 --> 01:05:49.380
- He's very convincing.
- So was Hitler.

1068
01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:50.685
So was Hitler.

1069
01:05:50.685 --> 01:05:52.644
You give that man a
stage with a few people.

1070
01:05:53.601 --> 01:05:55.734
he'll have an army of
followers in no time.

1071
01:05:58.345 --> 01:06:00.086
Wake up. Nicole.

1072
01:06:14.709 --> 01:06:16.015
Who is that?

1073
01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:23.022
I'm proud of you. truly.

1074
01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:26.025
You showed real initiative on
the range.

1075
01:06:26.025 --> 01:06:27.548
You must have an anger inside.

1076
01:06:29.333 --> 01:06:30.812
The first night I was here.

1077
01:06:34.294 --> 01:06:35.121
did I kill him?

1078
01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.081
Yes.

1079
01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:40.300
You are strong.

1080
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.041
You are not a victim.

1081
01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:44.304
I know everything about you.

1082
01:06:44.304 --> 01:06:45.784
I know your thoughts.

1083
01:06:45.784 --> 01:06:48.439
I'm in your head.

1084
01:06:48.439 --> 01:06:49.570
You're not weak.

1085
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:51.050
You're a fighter!

1086
01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:54.227
And you will prove that.
finally. once and for all.

1087
01:06:55.098 --> 01:06:57.578
Is this your idea of a cure?

1088
01:06:57.578 --> 01:06:59.580
Turn me into a murderer?

1089
01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:03.323
No. I promised you I'd give
you results.

1090
01:07:03.323 --> 01:07:04.324
I'd cure you.

1091
01:07:05.195 --> 01:07:06.500
Your weakness was taken away

1092
01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.589
from something that
happened a long time ago.

1093
01:07:08.589 --> 01:07:09.938
Tell me what that was.

1094
01:07:09.938 --> 01:07:11.636
and don't dare give me that story

1095
01:07:11.636 --> 01:07:13.116
about your mother shooting your father

1096
01:07:13.116 --> 01:07:15.031
and you becoming ward of the state.

1097
01:07:18.469 --> 01:07:21.254
My father raped me when I was 12.

1098
01:07:22.473 --> 01:07:23.648
Yes.

1099
01:07:23.648 --> 01:07:24.779
Say it again. Nicole.

1100
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:29.088
My father raped me when I was 12.

1101
01:07:29.088 --> 01:07:30.263
What happened after?

1102
01:07:31.438 --> 01:07:32.961
After I reported him.

1103
01:07:34.615 --> 01:07:35.442
nothing happened.

1104
01:07:36.313 --> 01:07:38.358
Nobody believed me.

1105
01:07:38.358 --> 01:07:40.534
and then. he left.

1106
01:07:40.534 --> 01:07:43.494
He left my mother and me.

1107
01:07:43.494 --> 01:07:46.975
and we never saw that piece of
shit again.

1108
01:07:47.846 --> 01:07:50.762
That memory is holding you back.

1109
01:07:50.762 --> 01:07:53.547
You need to get your
father out of your head.

1110
01:07:54.418 --> 01:07:56.811
There's no way that's ever
gonna happen.

1111
01:07:56.811 --> 01:07:59.162
What if you can get
him out of your life?

1112
01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:14.307
Where did you find this pig?

1113
01:08:14.307 --> 01:08:15.743
You don't need to know that.

1114
01:08:15.743 --> 01:08:18.311
All you need to know is that he
is here.

1115
01:08:18.311 --> 01:08:21.184
and he is the source of your weakness.

1116
01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:24.709
and if you can rid the world
of one more piece of shit.

1117
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:25.927
then you will rid the world

1118
01:08:25.927 --> 01:08:29.322
of everything that is holding
you back!

1119
01:08:31.063 --> 01:08:33.631
No. leave it on.

1120
01:08:34.675 --> 01:08:36.112
I don't wanna hear his voice.

1121
01:08:36.982 --> 01:08:39.289
I hear it enough in my head.

1122
01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:23.741
You can make a choice. Frank.

1123
01:10:26.657 --> 01:10:30.748
You can prove that you
could stand up for yourself.

1124
01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:32.445
I'm not the person I was.

1125
01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:36.623
I could man up.

1126
01:10:38.408 --> 01:10:39.844
I could do things.

1127
01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.240
Good. Frank. good.

1128
01:10:45.632 --> 01:10:47.808
You just tell me what I need
to do.

1129
01:10:49.114 --> 01:10:52.030
Take that bat and crush it.

1130
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:54.250
Smash it to pieces.

1131
01:11:10.004 --> 01:11:12.398
What are you waiting for?

1132
01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:14.748
It's...

1133
01:11:14.748 --> 01:11:15.749
It's crying.

1134
01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:20.319
What are you doing?

1135
01:11:20.319 --> 01:11:21.189
It's...

1136
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:23.496
Is that...

1137
01:11:25.063 --> 01:11:26.282
Is that...

1138
01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:29.502
Pick up the bat and smash it.

1139
01:11:29.502 --> 01:11:33.506
I can't.

1140
01:11:33.506 --> 01:11:35.160
I can't.

1141
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.640
Yes. you can!

1142
01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.946
Pick up the bat and smash it!

1143
01:11:40.905 --> 01:11:41.688
Do it!

1144
01:11:41.688 --> 01:11:43.299
No!

1145
01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:45.301
Crush your fears!

1146
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:48.521
No!

1147
01:11:48.521 --> 01:11:50.480
Good. Frank.

1148
01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:53.134
Good.

1149
01:11:58.052 --> 01:11:59.184
What's he doin' here?

1150
01:12:01.055 --> 01:12:03.057
John here doesn't hesitate.

1151
01:12:03.057 --> 01:12:04.276
He takes what he wants.

1152
01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:08.280
That man is a pedophile
who needs to be punished.

1153
01:12:14.634 --> 01:12:15.722
So what now. Frank?

1154
01:12:16.941 --> 01:12:18.072
You made a choice.

1155
01:12:18.943 --> 01:12:20.074
You stood up to me.

1156
01:12:23.643 --> 01:12:28.692
I'm so sorry!

1157
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:31.521
I couldn't do it.

1158
01:12:34.262 --> 01:12:36.613
I just couldn't go through with
it!

1159
01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.360
Dammit. Frank!

1160
01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.491
You were there!

1161
01:12:45.491 --> 01:12:47.232
You were so close!

1162
01:12:47.232 --> 01:12:48.189
You stood up to me!

1163
01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:49.930
You challenged me. and then...

1164
01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.803
Blew it.

1165
01:12:52.803 --> 01:12:54.500
Get him the fuck off this earth!

1166
01:12:55.762 --> 01:12:57.503
Sorry. Frank.

1167
01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.119
Lost another one. huh. Tobin?

1168
01:13:16.348 --> 01:13:19.177
What the fuck is
going on?

1169
01:13:19.177 --> 01:13:20.918
Lily.

1170
01:13:20.918 --> 01:13:22.441
Oh. Lily.

1171
01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:25.052
I'm proud of the way you've
embraced these trainings.

1172
01:13:26.358 --> 01:13:27.272
What the hell?

1173
01:13:27.272 --> 01:13:29.056
What happened to Frank?

1174
01:13:29.056 --> 01:13:30.493
Focus. Lily.

1175
01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:33.626
I'll handle this. John.

1176
01:13:33.626 --> 01:13:35.454
Lily. my dear. you've done well.

1177
01:13:35.454 --> 01:13:36.412
You've changed!

1178
01:13:37.282 --> 01:13:40.111
But you really haven't
faced that many challenges.

1179
01:13:40.111 --> 01:13:41.678
Is Frank dead?

1180
01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.768
Are you gonna kill me?

1181
01:13:44.768 --> 01:13:45.899
Shut it!

1182
01:13:45.899 --> 01:13:47.118
You say Frank's name one more time.

1183
01:13:47.118 --> 01:13:48.336
and I swear to god.

1184
01:13:48.336 --> 01:13:49.337
I'll have John put a bullet in
your head.

1185
01:13:49.337 --> 01:13:50.730
just like he did to Frank!

1186
01:13:52.776 --> 01:13:54.125
Now. what do we have here?

1187
01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.433
We have a final meal.

1188
01:13:58.869 --> 01:14:01.785
A last supper. so to speak.

1189
01:14:01.785 --> 01:14:03.439
What does that mean?

1190
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:06.572
John?

1191
01:14:20.412 --> 01:14:23.241
What are you gonna make
me do?

1192
01:14:23.241 --> 01:14:25.156
You're going to eat that.

1193
01:14:25.156 --> 01:14:27.463
You're going to eat the weak.

1194
01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:31.336
Initially. we were just gonna
have to have

1195
01:14:31.336 --> 01:14:32.337
you eat some leeches.

1196
01:14:32.337 --> 01:14:33.773
but things happened.

1197
01:14:33.773 --> 01:14:36.297
and. well. Frank's weak.

1198
01:14:36.297 --> 01:14:40.563
and if you eat Frank. you'll
be eating your weakness.

1199
01:14:40.563 --> 01:14:42.173
I can't.

1200
01:14:42.173 --> 01:14:43.827
You can and you will!

1201
01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:46.482
No.

1202
01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.484
Say yes to this.

1203
01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.398
You say yes to everything else.

1204
01:14:50.398 --> 01:14:51.791
say yes to this!

1205
01:14:51.791 --> 01:14:54.620
No.

1206
01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:56.492
Put the fucking skin in your
mouth!

1207
01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:00.844
Don't any of you fucking move!

1208
01:15:03.368 --> 01:15:06.327
Lily. pull your chair back.

1209
01:15:09.722 --> 01:15:12.943
You're a fucking murderer. Tobin Vance.

1210
01:15:12.943 --> 01:15:14.597
And you. too. John.

1211
01:15:14.597 --> 01:15:16.424
Whatever the fuck your name is!

1212
01:15:17.991 --> 01:15:20.951
I take it you're working
for Vance. too. huh?

1213
01:15:20.951 --> 01:15:22.039
Well. guess what?

1214
01:15:22.039 --> 01:15:23.780
You're all going to jail.

1215
01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:26.260
I'm a police officer.

1216
01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:28.567
That's right. dickhead!

1217
01:15:28.567 --> 01:15:31.352
I've been documenting everything.

1218
01:15:32.397 --> 01:15:34.399
And I've seen you fucks kill people.

1219
01:15:35.661 --> 01:15:36.532
Twice now!

1220
01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.753
You're gonna pay.

1221
01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.322
Haven't we changed you. Jesse?

1222
01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:49.109
That is a fucking joke!

1223
01:15:50.328 --> 01:15:51.808
This whole retreat is a joke.

1224
01:15:54.811 --> 01:15:55.638
Then shoot me.

1225
01:15:57.857 --> 01:15:58.684
What?

1226
01:16:00.077 --> 01:16:00.947
Shoot me.

1227
01:16:00.947 --> 01:16:02.862
Let's see if you have the guts.

1228
01:16:02.862 --> 01:16:03.907
Oh.

1229
01:16:03.907 --> 01:16:05.038
Oh. I have the guts.

1230
01:16:05.996 --> 01:16:07.432
20 years on the force.

1231
01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:09.956
So what?

1232
01:16:09.956 --> 01:16:11.654
You're an undercover cop?

1233
01:16:11.654 --> 01:16:14.613
You stay the fuck out of this.
John!

1234
01:16:14.613 --> 01:16:16.441
Had you figured out all along!

1235
01:16:20.967 --> 01:16:23.274
Sit down!

1236
01:16:24.884 --> 01:16:28.235
No. you're gonna have
to shoot me to learn.

1237
01:16:28.235 --> 01:16:29.323
To learn what. huh?

1238
01:16:31.151 --> 01:16:33.284
That I can put down a piece of
shit?

1239
01:16:33.284 --> 01:16:35.852
I already learned that.

1240
01:16:35.852 --> 01:16:36.679
Do it now!

1241
01:16:36.679 --> 01:16:38.115
Shut the fuck up!

1242
01:16:38.115 --> 01:16:39.377
Both of you!

1243
01:16:39.377 --> 01:16:40.857
Pull the trigger!

1244
01:16:51.868 --> 01:16:53.130
You!

1245
01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:55.480
You fucking bastards!

1246
01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.048
You loaded my gun with blanks!

1247
01:16:59.702 --> 01:17:00.790
Did we. Jesse.

1248
01:17:02.443 --> 01:17:03.270
or did you?

1249
01:17:04.489 --> 01:17:05.969
What the fuck are you talkin'
about?

1250
01:17:07.492 --> 01:17:09.581
I'm a police officer.

1251
01:17:09.581 --> 01:17:13.063
I've been a police officer for
20 years!

1252
01:17:13.063 --> 01:17:14.717
You're not a cop.

1253
01:17:14.717 --> 01:17:16.544
You're simply insane.

1254
01:17:17.981 --> 01:17:20.113
Elizabeth.

1255
01:17:23.551 --> 01:17:24.814
Jesse Donovan.

1256
01:17:24.814 --> 01:17:26.598
in and out of psychiatric institutions

1257
01:17:26.598 --> 01:17:28.034
since he was 12-years-old.

1258
01:17:28.034 --> 01:17:31.081
Rejected by the Police Academy
six times.

1259
01:17:31.081 --> 01:17:34.040
Arrested twice for
impersonating an officer.

1260
01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.739
But my gun?

1261
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:40.090
Jesse. you're not a cop.

1262
01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:41.526
You're a nobody.

1263
01:17:41.526 --> 01:17:43.571
You're gun has blanks in it.

1264
01:17:43.571 --> 01:17:45.530
The same blanks you bought.

1265
01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:48.228
No.

1266
01:17:49.926 --> 01:17:53.016
Blanks.

1267
01:17:54.887 --> 01:17:56.889
Still do the job this way!

1268
01:17:58.021 --> 01:17:59.457
No. Jesse. wait!

1269
01:18:05.942 --> 01:18:08.684
That was the first time in a
long time.

1270
01:18:10.424 --> 01:18:13.036
That was not the result that I wanted.

1271
01:18:14.733 --> 01:18:15.778
And Jesse. too. huh?

1272
01:18:18.302 --> 01:18:19.129
What's that?

1273
01:18:20.608 --> 01:18:21.784
You just keep failing.

1274
01:18:48.332 --> 01:18:49.202
Clean this mess up.

1275
01:18:58.081 --> 01:19:00.910
Maybe he's lost the
ability to close candidates?

1276
01:19:02.955 --> 01:19:05.044
What are you getting at?

1277
01:19:05.044 --> 01:19:07.525
Tobin wanted Jesse as an acolyte.

1278
01:19:07.525 --> 01:19:08.787
Frank. too.

1279
01:19:08.787 --> 01:19:11.268
He wanted all of them.
and he only got two.

1280
01:19:14.010 --> 01:19:15.228
Not to mention.

1281
01:19:15.228 --> 01:19:16.708
when he went easy on
Henry at the gun range.

1282
01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:19.406
What are you saying. John?

1283
01:19:22.409 --> 01:19:24.760
Is Tobin the man he once was?

1284
01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:27.980
Victor?

1285
01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:29.982
So is that what he's doing now?

1286
01:19:31.679 --> 01:19:33.333
Creating an army?

1287
01:19:34.421 --> 01:19:37.947
You've got a problem.

1288
01:19:39.339 --> 01:19:41.951
You don't know how powerful you
are!

1289
01:19:43.691 --> 01:19:44.954
But it's not your fault!

1290
01:19:46.085 --> 01:19:47.478
And you have no one to blame.

1291
01:19:47.478 --> 01:19:49.306
so you blame yourself!

1292
01:19:50.176 --> 01:19:53.179
I'm sorry. Tobin doesn't
want you in the program.

1293
01:19:55.442 --> 01:19:57.183
I'm done talking about this.

1294
01:19:58.184 --> 01:20:00.143
I don't know shit about what
he's doing.

1295
01:20:01.884 --> 01:20:02.754
Starting...

1296
01:20:04.625 --> 01:20:05.931
An army.

1297
01:20:10.066 --> 01:20:14.853
Your number one goal should
be to find your purpose!

1298
01:20:17.551 --> 01:20:18.378
But you can't!

1299
01:20:19.466 --> 01:20:23.296
Because first. you need
to find your enemy.

1300
01:20:23.296 --> 01:20:25.298
identify them.

1301
01:20:25.298 --> 01:20:27.474
so that you can rise up.

1302
01:20:27.474 --> 01:20:28.606
and crush them!

1303
01:20:29.955 --> 01:20:31.043
When you do that.

1304
01:20:31.043 --> 01:20:34.525
the possibilities are endless!

1305
01:20:34.525 --> 01:20:36.832
And you can rule the world!

1306
01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.881
I said I was done talkin'
about this.

1307
01:20:45.492 --> 01:20:47.146
And when I say I'm done. I'm
done.

1308
01:20:48.017 --> 01:20:49.322
Got it?

1309
01:20:49.322 --> 01:20:50.149
Got it.

1310
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.976
You got it?

1311
01:20:50.976 --> 01:20:51.847
Got it out there?

1312
01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:52.804
Got it here?

1313
01:20:52.804 --> 01:20:53.631
Got it...

1314
01:20:53.631 --> 01:20:54.458
Got it everywhere again.

1315
01:20:57.635 --> 01:21:02.292
Now. let's talk about results.
