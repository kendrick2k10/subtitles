00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.577
Please let me get in.

4
00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.949
Finley sinclair?

5
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:27.576
Yes!

6
00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:19.094
Is that you?

7
00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:20.428
Yeah.

8
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:26.142
How'd it go?

9
00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:29.896
So much for prayers.

10
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.436
Oh. honey.

11
00:02:31.902 --> 00:02:35.110
You can still audition
one more time in the fall.

12
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:38.318
Come here. come here. come here.

13
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.531
I know.

14
00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:42.492
You might need to
think about a plan b.

15
00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.326
Maybe what you need
is a change of scenery.

16
00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:56.920
Maybe I can try that semester
abroad program that Alex did.

17
00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.924
I'd like to
welcome you on this flight

18
00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:07.221
to Dublin. Ireland.

19
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.847
It will take us approximately
six hours and ten minutes

20
00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.017
of flight time.

21
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.858
Hey. there's an extra seat
in first class

22
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:15.691
if you want it.

23
00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.857
It's a long flight to Ireland.

24
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.986
- Yes. please.
- Come on.

25
00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:32.163
Have fun.

26
00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:38.874
Magazine. magazine.

27
00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.466
Yeah. thank you.

28
00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:58.185
Sir. your friend needs to
put her seat belt on.

29
00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.812
Yeah. thanks.

30
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.774
As much as I'd love
a beautiful girl

31
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:08.028
drooling on my shoulder.
you better buckle up.

32
00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.823
I'm. I'm. I'm so sorry. uh.

33
00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.995
And don't worry.
your snoring is cute.

34
00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:14.542
I'm-I'm so sorry.

35
00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:16.662
I don't. I didn't even think
I would fall asleep.

36
00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.914
It's not something I.

37
00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.720
Beckett rush? - Shhh. Geez.

38
00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:28.181
I've gotten this far without
being bothered. all right.

39
00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:29.345
Look. if you keep quiet.
I'll give you

40
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.183
an autograph or something
when we land.

41
00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:32.052
Just. no body parts.

42
00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:34.145
I stopped doing that
a while ago.

43
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:34.683
Ewwl

44
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:35.646
flight attendant
probably thought

45
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.606
she was making your year
seating you next to me.

46
00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:38.726
We can do a selfie

47
00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:40.102
or something.
just when we land. All right.

48
00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.728
I don't want to attract
any attention right now.

49
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.652
I really don't want
anything from you.

50
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:46.699
Somebody's grumpy
when they wake up.

51
00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.365
No. but. Arrogance
makes me grumpy.

52
00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.488
Well. some people mistake
confidence for arrogance.

53
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.037
I'm pretty sure
it's just arrogance.

54
00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:55.750
I know your type.

55
00:04:58.173 --> 00:04:58.878
So. since you know my name.

56
00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:01.589
I think it's only fair
that I know yours.

57
00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.840
Finley sinclair.

58
00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.054
And what brings you to Ireland.
Finley sinclair?

59
00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:10.845
A semester abroad program
at my college.

60
00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:15.683
My brother did this a few
years ago. and he loved it.

61
00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:19.065
Changed his whole life.

62
00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:20.976
Maybe it'll work for me.

63
00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.069
Hmmm. So you have issues?

64
00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:27.191
Hmm. Life can be tough
outside of the celebrity bubble.

65
00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:29.659
You know. in the real world.

66
00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.244
A bit of advice for you.

67
00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:31.577
Hmmm.

68
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.071
You might wanna brush up
on your people skills

69
00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:36.246
if you're gonna make it
in a small Irish town.

70
00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:36.662
Oh!

71
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.583
And. um. are you an expert
on small towns in Ireland?

72
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.296
Yeah. I am. actually.

73
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.712
We've shot three
dawn of the dragon movies there.

74
00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.505
About to shoot number four.

75
00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:47.798
Hmm.

76
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.848
Touche. I sit corrected.

77
00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:54.388
You know.
you look really beautiful

78
00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.387
when you admit
that you're wrong.

79
00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.711
Yeah. I didn't like
that article either.

80
00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.309
Ba-bye!

81
00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:41.477
Bye!

82
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:45.018
Whoa!
You any good on that thing?

83
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.065
Uh. Not good enough.

84
00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:49.280
But. I'm going to be
practicing a lot while I'm here.

85
00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.320
and working
on a new audition piece.

86
00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:53.740
Sounds boring.
but suit yourself.

87
00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.387
Who knows. maybe we'll
run into each other

88
00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.155
in a pub somewhere. spindly?

89
00:06:57.167 --> 00:07:00.830
It's Finley.
and I seriously doubt that.

90
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.707
Well. I hope you find
what you're looking for.

91
00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:07.048
And maybe even a little bit
of fun. while you're at it.

92
00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:11.261
Welcome to Ireland.
Felicity sinclair.

93
00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.379
It's.

94
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.346
Peace out.

95
00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:15.511
Have a nice trip. Bye. bye.

96
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:16.849
Okay. never mind.

97
00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.153
Oh. my gosh. it's Beckett.

98
00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:35.409
Will you sign this for me?

99
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.696
All right. okay. one at a time.

100
00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.286
Finley!

101
00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:45.412
Oh!

102
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:46.204
Hey you. - Mwah!

103
00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.207
Oh! You look exactly
like your picture.

104
00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:50.630
Emma?
â€œWe're sisters for four months.

105
00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.377
Okay. it's nice to meet you.
too.

106
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:54.050
I heard Beckett rush
is at the airport.

107
00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:56.013
His new movie is like
the biggest thing

108
00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.554
that has ever happened
in carlingford.

109
00:07:58.561 --> 00:07:59.050
Do you like him?

110
00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:01.804
Ahem. you know.
a little too cocky for me.

111
00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.806
I love him. Fact!

112
00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:06.732
Hello. Finley!

113
00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:10.194
- Hi!
- It is so good to have you.

114
00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:12.063
We just loved your brother.

115
00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:13.906
He was one of the family.

116
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.025
And now you are. too.

117
00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:17.243
The good news
is that we inherited

118
00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:18.407
a bed and breakfast
three months ago.

119
00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:22.078
Sean has retired from the army.
and we're runnin' it together.

120
00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:24.246
We're still trying
to figure it all out.

121
00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:25.869
Come on. everyone.
let's get goin'

122
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.246
before we get into
the second hour in the car park.

123
00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:30.089
I'll get your luggage.

124
00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.584
Thank you.
I can get this at least.

125
00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:35.545
Take this.

126
00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:40.597
J well I taste the darkness as
it it scours through my soul &

127
00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:45.814
j and I try to escape it
but it swallowed me whole &

128
00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:51.483
j I try to invade it
by runnin' away on it j

129
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:55.740
j filling my mind
with furious things j

130
00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:57.780
this town might be
a wee bit small

131
00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.278
for a New York girl.
but we'll get you out

132
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.201
to show you
the rest of the country soon.

133
00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.414
I can't wait to see it all.

134
00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.124
The old castles.
the cliffs of moher.

135
00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.915
My brother used to talk about
that place all the time.

136
00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:08.752
We'll take you all over.

137
00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.713
That would be amazing.

138
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:15.302
J find home and save my soul

139
00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:30.441
J find home save my soul j

140
00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:31.480
here we are.

141
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:32.603
Emma. go show Finley
to her room.

142
00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.070
I'll give you
the full tour later.

143
00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:36.030
There's a trampoline
around the back.

144
00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:36.864
If you jump high enough.

145
00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:39.735
you can see into the next-door
neighbor's bathroom.

146
00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:40.735
Don't worry. all the guests

147
00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.328
are at the other side
of the house.

148
00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:45.039
You can play your violin
up here anytime.

149
00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:46.453
No one will hear ya.

150
00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.746
This is my room.

151
00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:50.040
Mom thought
that you'd like your own one.

152
00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:51.663
But yours has the best views.

153
00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:52.504
My nan used to live in it.

154
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:55.797
She actually died there.
I wouldn't be scared about that.

155
00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:58.011
Obviously. I'm around the corner

156
00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:02.223
if you ever wanna talk.
do nails. sister things.

157
00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.934
Leave her alone. Emma.
Finley needs some rest.

158
00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:07.350
She has her orientation
in the mornin'.

159
00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.352
Out!

160
00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:23.949
- Good morning. Finley.
- [Finley hey!

161
00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.868
- Did you sleep well?
- All right.

162
00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.331
So. we're just busy
serving the guests.

163
00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:30.293
Pour yourself some tea.
Sean'll cook you some eggs.

164
00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.706
Coming right up!

165
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:33.250
I need to get my hair to behave.

166
00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:34.919
Emma. you mustn't go out there!

167
00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:36.882
I don't want you
disturbing the guests.

168
00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.467
Last time. I found her
chatting on for half an hour

169
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.087
with one of the guests
about her earthworm collection.

170
00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.555
I have a passion for biology.

171
00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:44.891
They don't need to hear
about earthworm droppings

172
00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:45.383
at breakfast.

173
00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.761
Go around.
Why do you always have to...

174
00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.856
- Arrgh!
- Oh!

175
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.725
Always go clockwise!

176
00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:55.601
That's our new system!

177
00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:56.940
Never mind.
This is getting cold.

178
00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:59.530
And we can't afford
any bad reviews.

179
00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.409
We can't go out there
wearing cranberry juice.

180
00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:05.620
What would our guests
think of that?

181
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.750
Love. I hate to ask.

182
00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:14.120
But would you mind taking this
to the gentleman in the corner?

183
00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:16.748
All you have to do is
set the plate down on the table.

184
00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:19.000
smile. and walk away.

185
00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.798
Yeah. of course.

186
00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:31.596
You?

187
00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:32.939
Good morning to you as well.

188
00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.183
You didn't spit in my food.
did you?

189
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:36.059
What are you doing here?

190
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.856
What does it look like?
I'm a guest.

191
00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.604
In one of these rooms?

192
00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:42.198
Yeah. that's usually
how it works.

193
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.191
Are you stalkin' me?

194
00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:43.988
- No!
- I thought you might be.

195
00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:47.453
I didn't buy that whole
"I'm not interested" bit.

196
00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:48.367
I'm staying here. too.

197
00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.911
What. the callahans
are your host family?

198
00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.079
Yeah.

199
00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:54.543
Shouldn't you be at some
boujee hotel with your harem?

200
00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.538
What are you talking about?
This is boujee.

201
00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.505
It's posh. The cooking's great.

202
00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:00.295
And the service is even better.

203
00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:00.792
Usually.

204
00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:03.670
Hmm. Oh. I have to go
to orientation. so enjoy.

205
00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:05.967
Well. I'll be staying here
for the next few months

206
00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:06.464
while we film.

207
00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.593
So. no sneaking up
into my room. young lady.

208
00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:10.263
Oh. don't worry.

209
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.307
I'm not supposed to
bother the guests.

210
00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:14.351
Even if they bother me.

211
00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:15.690
What do you have against me?

212
00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:18.480
I am trying to stay focused.

213
00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:23.319
And I just don't think
you're gonna help with that.

214
00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:25.817
- And how would you know?
- I see the news.

215
00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:29.320
Well. maybe things aren't
always as they seem.

216
00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:31.163
I know your type.

217
00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:33.290
I'll see you later. frankey.

218
00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:36.286
Hmmm. It's Finley.
but good-good try.

219
00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:46.134
Um. Why is Beckett rush
in the dining room?

220
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.971
What? Nooo.

221
00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:51.389
No. that's definitely him.

222
00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:53.057
You can't tell anyone.

223
00:12:53.064 --> 00:12:56.431
Beckett rush is in my house.

224
00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:58.182
I'd never even heard of him
till yesterday.

225
00:12:58.194 --> 00:12:59.604
Of course. you didn't.
You're such a dad.

226
00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:02.228
He's only like. the biggest
movie star in the world.

227
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.730
She's got posters of him
in her room.

228
00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:06.357
Ah. that's why I recognized him.

229
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.370
Nora. dear.

230
00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.614
Do you have any jam
for the scones?

231
00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:14.115
Yes. sure. love.

232
00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.000
Just made it fresh yesterday.

233
00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:17.164
Ah! Brilliant.

234
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.171
Cheers.

235
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.125
Your daughter has lost her mind.

236
00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:27.049
This is exactly why
I didn't want to tell her.

237
00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:29.217
Now. Not a word.

238
00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:30.931
We have promised him
to keep it quiet.

239
00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:32.425
The whole town
is gonna find out.

240
00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:34.223
Well. it's not gonna be
because of us.

241
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.313
We are going to give him
a place away from the press.

242
00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.103
If they find out.
the b&b could be at risk.

243
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.068
We can't afford a bad review
from an international celebrity

244
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.403
right when we're starting out.

245
00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:49.776
Oh. shite!

246
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.206
I heard the heart slayer
is staying at your b&b?

247
00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:02.546
See. the whole town knows.
and I can't say a word.

248
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.790
Don't worry. Irish small towns

249
00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.299
are good at keepin' secrets.

250
00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:06.383
The people here
won't let it out.

251
00:14:06.387 --> 00:14:08.127
Yeah. and if they do.
my parents'll lose

252
00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:11.882
their entire life savings.
and I'll end up in an orphanage.

253
00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.929
Your mom is going to be
washing his sheets.

254
00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:14.641
How insane is that?

255
00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:17.478
Not the first thing
that came to my mind. but yes.

256
00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:20.807
Hey. maybe Beckett
will ask you to the dance.

257
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.021
Right. The hottest guy
in the whole world

258
00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:25.441
is gonna break up
with Taylor risdale.

259
00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:26.938
Look me in the eye and say.

260
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:30.112
hey. Emma.
will you go out with me?

261
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.111
No one has ever
even asked me to it.

262
00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:34.532
Bull. What's this dance?

263
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.826
It's the big town festival
that happens every Autumn.

264
00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.117
It's where all of our parents
fell in love.

265
00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:40.208
It's disgusting.

266
00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:40.827
It's amazing.

267
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.245
The whole town comes out for it.

268
00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:43.837
Outside. under the lights.

269
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:44.921
It's so romantic.

270
00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:45.631
Or depressing.

271
00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:47.842
Guys are already
startin' to ask.

272
00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:50.006
Well. maybe this is your year.

273
00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:55.425
Yeah. maybe.

274
00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:57.802
Any lads you fancy yet?

275
00:14:57.814 --> 00:14:59.395
It's just my first day.

276
00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.264
Maybe Beckett will ask you.

277
00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:05.985
I think he prefers his snooty
celebrity soirees.

278
00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:07.524
Not really my type.

279
00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:11.858
Dragons!

280
00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:13.484
To the bottom lines.

281
00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.705
Archers. at the ready!

282
00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:20.833
Oriana!

283
00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:22.043
My love!

284
00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:25.038
Come with me. I'll protect you.

285
00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.545
My bow!

286
00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:32.052
Stay close.

287
00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:43.139
Hurry up. keep going.

288
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:48.027
If you save me.

289
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.568
my father might
finally accept our love.

290
00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:54.033
my one true knight.

291
00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:55.276
Duck!

292
00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:01.293
More dragons.

293
00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:07.622
We have to go. now!

294
00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:27.900
I am Steele markov.
son of talagorn.

295
00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.269
May this arrow be true.

296
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.067
and find the heart
of this beast.

297
00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:33.484
Cut!

298
00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:36.238
Okay. guys. back to.

299
00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:42.786
How was that? Did you feel it?

300
00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:43.452
Yeah. Sure.

301
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:46.453
Beck. Beck. Beck. Beck. Beck.

302
00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:49.922
How are you. man?
Okay yeah. everything good?

303
00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.757
- Yeah.
- What the bloody hell

304
00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:52.796
was that? Huh?

305
00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:54.134
I just thought I'd try something

306
00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:55.093
a little more subtle. you know?

307
00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:56.928
Subtle? Can you amp it up. man?

308
00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:59.766
- I can amp it up.
- Great. Okay. good.

309
00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.806
Because. if not. my friend.
I am afraid.

310
00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:05.771
we're going to have to
kill off your character.

311
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.527
I am joking.

312
00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:12.441
I no serious.

313
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:14.404
I make a joke. used to feel.

314
00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:16.114
Okay. he can do it. guys.

315
00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:17.449
He's okay. Let's go.

316
00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:18.943
He can do it. I think.

317
00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.445
Back to one!

318
00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:22.242
Take 17.

319
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.114
You okay?

320
00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:24.410
- Yeah.
- All right. good.

321
00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:25.999
Hey. listen. I heard
the studio is considering

322
00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:28.710
a trilogy of Steele markov
spin-off movies

323
00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:29.499
for you and Taylor.

324
00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:32.374
So. you'll finally be getting
paid what you're worth.

325
00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.170
plus back end.

326
00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:36.590
So. you know.
just give him what he wants.

327
00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:37.803
Yeah. Yeah.

328
00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.513
Don't screw this up.

329
00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.178
Okay. uh.

330
00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:42.470
Just give me some space. Okay.

331
00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:43.342
Yes. whatever you need.

332
00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:46.141
I'm here for you. All right.

333
00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:47.183
Thanks.

334
00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:50.395
So one more like that.

335
00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:51.768
please. -

336
00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:07.033
- It's just me.
- Oh. come in. Nora.

337
00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:10.332
Finley. I'm sorry.
but we can't take you

338
00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:11.670
to the cliffs of moher
this weekend.

339
00:18:11.674 --> 00:18:14.541
Sean has to fix a heater
and re-tile a bathroom.

340
00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:17.510
so I have to do the hosting
while he's workin'.

341
00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:20.801
Oh. that's.
Yeah. that... that's okay.

342
00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:22.719
But I got you a bike
down at the shops today.

343
00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:25.719
So. you can use that
to get around town at least.

344
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.594
Thank you. Yeah. No.

345
00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:28.187
You know. we.
I have plenty of time

346
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.851
to see the rest of the country.
so.

347
00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:31.599
Aye. plenty.

348
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:35.269
Listen. I was. um.

349
00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.363
Cleanin' up in here
a few weeks ago.

350
00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:38.526
gettin' the place ready for you.

351
00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:41.367
And I found this
under the dresser.

352
00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:45.159
It's Alex's journal
from when he was here.

353
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.787
I didn't.
Pry or peek or anythin'.

354
00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.750
But. Maybe just a little.

355
00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:55.590
Enough to see it's. Got
all his drawings and writings.

356
00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:58.755
It's old fashioned like.

357
00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.344
Yeah. he was like that.

358
00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:01.303
I was gonna send it to your mom.

359
00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:04.765
But. Then I just thought
I'd give it to you.

360
00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:09.604
I. I wouldn't want it
to get lost in the post.

361
00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:16.733
Thank you. Nora.
This is. Amazing.

362
00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:19.105
He was always workin'
on those drawings.

363
00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:25.408
Now you can see all the things
he loved here.

364
00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:31.743
Yeah. um. he was so at peace.
you know. when he.

365
00:19:31.754 --> 00:19:32.459
When he came back.

366
00:19:32.463 --> 00:19:37.332
and. He was just
an amazing brother.

367
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:40.342
He was.

368
00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:49.385
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to bring up sad memories.

369
00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:50.397
It's okay.

370
00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:53.074
Are you done yet?

371
00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:55.201
I don't like dead bodies
near my feet.

372
00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.495
Yeah. uh. are there more crosses

373
00:20:57.506 --> 00:20:58.621
like this around here?

374
00:20:58.632 --> 00:21:01.294
Yeah. like everywhere.

375
00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:02.302
Oh.

376
00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:12.347
Oh. come on. Finley.

377
00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:13.514
I think something
just touched me.

378
00:21:13.522 --> 00:21:16.685
Uh. yeah. I...
I got to get practicing anyway.

379
00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:18.023
Good. Let's go.

380
00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.016
Run! It's no bother.

381
00:21:19.028 --> 00:21:20.518
Oh. sorry about that.

382
00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:21.644
Have a good day.

383
00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:22.770
Come on. Finley.

384
00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:28.742
Okay.

385
00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:44.925
Nora? You can just come in.

386
00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:49.054
Wha... what are you doing?

387
00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:51.390
You're pretty good
on that thing. you know.

388
00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:53.676
You... heard me?

389
00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:57.271
Yeah. Yeah. you play
like your personality.

390
00:21:57.274 --> 00:21:58.263
And how is that?

391
00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:00.015
Beautiful. but a bit stiff.

392
00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:03.895
Hmmm. What are you doing
up here anyway?

393
00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:05.066
I'm about to ask you a favor.

394
00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:05.904
I'm about to say no.

395
00:22:05.908 --> 00:22:08.194
And I'm about to ignore that.

396
00:22:08.202 --> 00:22:09.442
I need some help
running my lines.

397
00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:11.409
like somebody to work off with.

398
00:22:11.413 --> 00:22:11.742
No.

399
00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:13.738
How can you say no
to this face? Huh?

400
00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:16.240
Oh. I am up-to-date
on all of my shots

401
00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:18.038
and immune to everything.

402
00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:19.410
Oh. come on. Frankie.

403
00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:19.910
It's Finley.

404
00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:21.833
No wonder you don't
remember your lines.

405
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.131
Look. uh.

406
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:31.798
Things have been tough on set.
And my scenes aren't going well.

407
00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:35.722
I'm... I'm in my head.
and I need something new

408
00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:37.469
to break me out of it.

409
00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:43.271
Yeah. I. I know all about that.

410
00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:46.983
Oh. cool drawing.
Do you do this?

411
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:50.449
Uh. no. uh. hey.
I did not say you could come in.

412
00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:52.443
Why? Are all your deepest.
darkest secrets in there?

413
00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:57.039
No. this is my brother's
from when he spent time here.

414
00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:59.283
I just... I can't get
this cross out of my mind.

415
00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:02.537
I mean. why would he write
my name at the bottom of this?

416
00:23:02.548 --> 00:23:03.333
Have you seen this anywhere?

417
00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:05.623
Yeah. there's crosses like that
all over the place.

418
00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:07.295
No. I...
I need to find this one.

419
00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:10.295
So why don't you just text him
and ask him where it is?

420
00:23:12.474 --> 00:23:15.966
He's. Dead.

421
00:23:18.147 --> 00:23:20.263
Oh! Uh. wow.

422
00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:25.480
I'm sorry.
I didn't. I didn't know.

423
00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:26.852
Uh.

424
00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:29.988
What happened?

425
00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:32.904
Um. I don't really
talk about it.

426
00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:37.076
Especially not with
Steele markov. the heart slayer.

427
00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:37.992
Well.

428
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.537
I'd like to think I'm
a little bit more than that.

429
00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:47.206
If you ever wanna talk.
I'm here.

430
00:23:47.217 --> 00:23:48.753
Seriously.

431
00:23:49.178 --> 00:23:51.510
Well. not here
in this room. exactly.

432
00:23:51.513 --> 00:23:54.300
'Cause I'm not allowed in.

433
00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:57.515
We could talk downstairs

434
00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:59.976
or. Wherever you want.

435
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:05.767
Okay. let's go.

436
00:24:05.778 --> 00:24:07.643
Where?

437
00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:08.986
Run your lines.

438
00:24:08.989 --> 00:24:10.729
Really? 'Cause we don't have to.

439
00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:13.653
Oh. come on.
before I change my mind.

440
00:24:15.746 --> 00:24:19.034
Oriana. we must find a way.
Don't give up on us.

441
00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:19.905
My father is the king.

442
00:24:19.917 --> 00:24:23.535
He won't allow anything
to interfere with his conquest.

443
00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:26.036
He's going to marry me off
to the prince of moor.

444
00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:27.879
He'll kill you
if you get in the way.

445
00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:30.590
Well. I'd rather die loving you
than live without you.

446
00:24:30.594 --> 00:24:34.178
My heart can't handle
living a lie.

447
00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:37.089
Come on.

448
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:38.090
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

449
00:24:38.102 --> 00:24:40.593
- It's so bad.
- Okay! Okay. okay. okay.

450
00:24:40.604 --> 00:24:44.688
Just give me a minute here.
I got to find it.

451
00:24:44.692 --> 00:24:46.978
Right.

452
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.151
Okay. uh.

453
00:24:59.081 --> 00:25:03.916
Oriana. we must find a way.
Don't give up on us.

454
00:25:04.545 --> 00:25:07.287
Uh. I'm doing it to protect you.

455
00:25:07.297 --> 00:25:08.628
My father is the king.

456
00:25:08.632 --> 00:25:12.124
He won't let anyone
interfere with his conquest.

457
00:25:12.136 --> 00:25:13.216
I'll find a way.

458
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.257
He's going to marry me off
to the prince of moor.

459
00:25:16.265 --> 00:25:19.632
If you get in the way.
they'll kill you.

460
00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:25.517
I'd rather die loving you
than live without you.

461
00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:29.357
My heart can't handle
living a lie.

462
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:37.237
How was that?

463
00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:38.279
Um.

464
00:25:38.287 --> 00:25:40.778
That was... that was great.

465
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:43.155
Uh. Not stiff at all that time.

466
00:25:43.167 --> 00:25:47.627
Uh. I need to.
I need to go to bed.

467
00:25:47.629 --> 00:25:49.039
I have class tomorrow. so.

468
00:25:49.048 --> 00:25:50.788
Oh. that sounds amazing.

469
00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:52.790
Yeah. you should
try it sometime.

470
00:25:52.801 --> 00:25:53.415
I wish I could.

471
00:25:53.427 --> 00:25:55.133
I mean.
I'd love to go to college.

472
00:25:55.137 --> 00:25:57.594
Yeah. well. uh.

473
00:25:57.598 --> 00:26:01.341
Hey. um. thanks for this.

474
00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:04.434
Seriously. you were great.

475
00:26:04.438 --> 00:26:06.144
Yeah. any time.

476
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:08.605
Night. Francine.

477
00:26:17.743 --> 00:26:20.075
As part of
your Irish studies class.

478
00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:21.489
you must complete
a service project

479
00:26:21.497 --> 00:26:24.614
in order to see this country
from a different perspective.

480
00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:28.334
So. each one of you will be
adopting a senior citizen

481
00:26:28.337 --> 00:26:30.498
from one of the nearby
nursin' homes.

482
00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:32.667
You will spend at least 20 hours

483
00:26:32.674 --> 00:26:33.754
with your new friend.

484
00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:37.798
and you will do what you can
to serve them during this time.

485
00:26:37.805 --> 00:26:39.090
At the end of the semester.

486
00:26:39.098 --> 00:26:41.339
you will be expected
to turn in an essay

487
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.218
outlining what you have
learned from this experience.

488
00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:11.038
So. thank you
so much for coming down to help.

489
00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:12.832
You'll find her
right through here.

490
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.547
Okay. thanks so much.

491
00:27:21.557 --> 00:27:24.344
Hello. Mrs. sweeney. - Get out.

492
00:27:24.852 --> 00:27:26.137
Oh. I'm. I'm Finley sinclair.

493
00:27:26.145 --> 00:27:28.932
I don't care if you're
the blessed virgin Mary.

494
00:27:28.939 --> 00:27:29.678
Get out!

495
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.729
Uh. uh. I. I was actually.

496
00:27:33.735 --> 00:27:34.474
I'm. I'm here from the college.

497
00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:37.353
I was assigned to you. I'm just.
I don't need schoolgirls

498
00:27:37.364 --> 00:27:37.978
pestering me.

499
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.073
I'll give you three seconds
to remove yourself.

500
00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:43.613
One. two. three.

501
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.826
Nurse!

502
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:45.615
Um.

503
00:27:45.622 --> 00:27:46.702
Nurse!

504
00:27:46.707 --> 00:27:47.617
Nurse! - No. no. no. It's okay.

505
00:27:47.624 --> 00:27:49.535
Fil. Fil til.

506
00:27:49.543 --> 00:27:50.953
What's going on here?

507
00:27:50.961 --> 00:27:52.997
I have an intruder!

508
00:27:54.423 --> 00:27:57.085
Don"t you remember
our conversation. cathleen?

509
00:27:57.092 --> 00:27:57.922
What about?

510
00:27:57.926 --> 00:28:00.338
Me eating more prunes?

511
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:02.461
The one about you
being civil to people

512
00:28:02.472 --> 00:28:03.427
who come to visit you.

513
00:28:03.432 --> 00:28:04.797
I don't need any visitors.

514
00:28:04.808 --> 00:28:07.174
I didn't last year
or the year before.

515
00:28:07.186 --> 00:28:08.426
and I don't today.

516
00:28:08.437 --> 00:28:09.893
You know what? I. I'm sure
I can get reassigned.

517
00:28:09.897 --> 00:28:11.979
It was. I'm sorry.
It was really nice to meet you.

518
00:28:11.982 --> 00:28:14.769
But can't you just give me
some other old person?

519
00:28:14.776 --> 00:28:16.983
Please. I mean.
she's a crazy witch.

520
00:28:16.987 --> 00:28:18.318
If I reassign you.
then I'm gonna have to

521
00:28:18.322 --> 00:28:19.903
make allowances
for all the other students.

522
00:28:19.907 --> 00:28:20.896
And I'm not gonna
deal with that.

523
00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:23.991
But she doesn't want me
or anyone else there. please.

524
00:28:23.994 --> 00:28:26.280
The staff wouldn't have
assigned her a student

525
00:28:26.288 --> 00:28:27.778
if she didn't need it.

526
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:29.154
Is. Isn't there just a food bank

527
00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:31.782
or an orphanage or just.
Anything else?

528
00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:32.657
This is the assignment.

529
00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:33.496
If you choose not to do it.

530
00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:35.494
you won't pass
your Irish studies class.

531
00:28:35.505 --> 00:28:38.622
L. I need to get
a good grade on this.

532
00:28:38.634 --> 00:28:42.843
Then you'll have to go make
broomsticks with the witch.

533
00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:44.131
Cheers.

534
00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:03.651
Hello again. Mrs. sweeney.

535
00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:07.402
[. I think we got off
to a bad start the other day.

536
00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:11.701
Ho. how. How many times
do I have to tell you

537
00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:13.073
to leave this bloody room?

538
00:29:13.085 --> 00:29:15.827
Oh. I can't do that.
Mrs. sweeney.

539
00:29:15.837 --> 00:29:17.498
But we're gonna be friends.

540
00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:19.713
I did bring pride and prejudice.

541
00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:21.123
I don't like Jane Austen.

542
00:29:21.134 --> 00:29:22.089
Hmmm. It's too bad.

543
00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:26.463
And I don't want to spend
all that remains of my life

544
00:29:26.473 --> 00:29:28.509
with the likes of yourself.

545
00:29:28.517 --> 00:29:29.802
Hmm. okay. you know what?

546
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.675
I tried to get out of this.
but I can't.

547
00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:34.303
I was really hoping
for a sweet old granny.

548
00:29:34.314 --> 00:29:35.314
but I got stuck with you.

549
00:29:36.858 --> 00:29:39.099
So that I can be good enough
to get into this music school.

550
00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:41.693
I have one last chance
to audition in three months.

551
00:29:41.697 --> 00:29:45.064
So. we're gonna be friends.
whether you like it or not!

552
00:29:45.075 --> 00:29:46.531
Have you finished?

553
00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:47.991
Hmmm-mm.

554
00:29:48.537 --> 00:29:52.405
If this is what
young people have come to.

555
00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:56.159
then the whole world is doomed.

556
00:29:57.004 --> 00:29:58.084
I'm callin' the nurse.

557
00:29:58.088 --> 00:30:00.545
Nurse!
Okay. Well. I'm not leaving.

558
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:01.004
Nurse!

559
00:30:01.008 --> 00:30:02.714
"It is a truth
universally acknowledged

560
00:30:02.718 --> 00:30:03.673
that a single man in possession

561
00:30:03.677 --> 00:30:05.383
of good fortune..."
Nurse! Nurse!

562
00:30:05.387 --> 00:30:06.627
"Must be in want of a wife."

563
00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:07.593
Where's the nurse? "However."

564
00:30:07.597 --> 00:30:10.509
- Nurse!
- What's all this noise?

565
00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:13.384
She won't leave.
She's invading my privacy.

566
00:30:13.395 --> 00:30:15.932
I want to remove her at once!

567
00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:23.523
Did you enter
without her permission?

568
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.111
Yeah. Yes.

569
00:30:25.115 --> 00:30:25.979
And did you refuse to leave

570
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:29.404
when Mrs. sweeney
asked you to do so?

571
00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:31.197
Yeah.

572
00:30:31.913 --> 00:30:34.120
Good on you. young one.

573
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.746
Cathleen.
you can shout all you like.

574
00:30:38.754 --> 00:30:41.166
but Finley's welcome to stay.

575
00:30:41.798 --> 00:30:43.504
Bye. ladies.

576
00:30:44.801 --> 00:30:46.883
Um. if it's any consolation.

577
00:30:46.887 --> 00:30:49.629
this went much better
in my head.

578
00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:52.260
Humpf.

579
00:30:54.061 --> 00:30:55.926
"It is a truth
universally acknowledged

580
00:30:55.937 --> 00:31:00.101
that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must."

581
00:31:17.626 --> 00:31:18.911
She calm down?

582
00:31:18.919 --> 00:31:21.331
Yeah. she fell asleep.

583
00:31:21.338 --> 00:31:22.293
I have to check on a resident.

584
00:31:22.297 --> 00:31:24.788
Do me a favor and pop this
into her top drawer.

585
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.166
Cathleen always tells me
to throw her post away.

586
00:31:27.177 --> 00:31:28.792
but I know
she just digs these letters

587
00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:30.965
out of the bin and saves them.

588
00:31:30.972 --> 00:31:32.963
No idea what it's about.

589
00:31:57.666 --> 00:31:59.452
Hey. how was the nursin' home?

590
00:31:59.459 --> 00:32:04.169
Well. that bitter old lady.
Mrs. sweeney. really hates me.

591
00:32:04.172 --> 00:32:06.333
They've assigned you
cathleen sweeney?

592
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:07.501
Hmm-mm.

593
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:08.214
Who is this lady?

594
00:32:08.218 --> 00:32:10.675
I wanna meet her. I bet you.
I could make her smile.

595
00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:12.886
Not a chance.

596
00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:15.839
Gather round!

597
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:17.842
Fresh scones!

598
00:32:19.438 --> 00:32:21.099
Arrghh!

599
00:32:21.106 --> 00:32:22.437
Damn it!

600
00:32:22.441 --> 00:32:24.147
When are you going to learn?

601
00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:27.935
Try a scone. guys.

602
00:32:30.323 --> 00:32:31.813
Thanks. love.

603
00:32:31.825 --> 00:32:33.281
Brilliant. Mr. Callahan.

604
00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:34.900
Finally. something
we can agree on.

605
00:32:34.911 --> 00:32:36.902
How's the movie going?

606
00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:38.570
I know Emma wants to know.

607
00:32:38.582 --> 00:32:39.697
Dad!

608
00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:41.869
Well. it wasn't going well
until I started

609
00:32:41.877 --> 00:32:43.868
running lines with Finley.

610
00:32:43.879 --> 00:32:46.245
Now the director
can't stop complimenting me.

611
00:32:46.256 --> 00:32:49.293
He says Steele markov
has come alive.

612
00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:49.835
Ohh!

613
00:32:49.843 --> 00:32:52.175
Do you think we could run
my other lines. tonight. maybe?

614
00:32:52.179 --> 00:32:54.261
I. I really need to get to

615
00:32:54.264 --> 00:32:56.676
my violin composition
at some point.

616
00:32:56.683 --> 00:32:58.219
Well. I can work
around your schedule.

617
00:32:58.226 --> 00:33:01.468
I mean. if you want to come
to set after class or.

618
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.936
Or... or we could work here?

619
00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:05.097
Uh. there's nothing special
about what I did.

620
00:33:05.108 --> 00:33:07.224
Anyone could have done it.

621
00:33:07.569 --> 00:33:08.479
- Thank you. Nora.
- Hey. uh.

622
00:33:08.487 --> 00:33:10.273
Do you think we can go to the
cliffs of moher this weekend?

623
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.067
I am so sorry. honey.
I feel terrible.

624
00:33:13.074 --> 00:33:15.315
These scrapbookers
are here all weekend.

625
00:33:15.327 --> 00:33:15.941
We can't leave.

626
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:18.906
- It's okay.
- Well. I could take you.

627
00:33:19.748 --> 00:33:20.237
Uh. no.

628
00:33:20.248 --> 00:33:23.832
Fil. Fil. Ti just
go with them when they can.

629
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:25.496
All right.

630
00:33:25.504 --> 00:33:27.665
Let me know
if you change your mind.

631
00:33:34.804 --> 00:33:35.509
Tom.

632
00:33:35.514 --> 00:33:36.469
- Taken.
- Francis.

633
00:33:36.473 --> 00:33:37.929
- Taken.
- Shaun.

634
00:33:37.933 --> 00:33:39.264
- Taken.
- Why?

635
00:33:39.267 --> 00:33:40.552
He has a micro scooter.

636
00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.265
- Does he?
- Yes.

637
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:42.429
I can see the look in the eyes

638
00:33:42.437 --> 00:33:45.270
when young ladies
are thinkin' about the festival.

639
00:33:45.273 --> 00:33:47.764
I hear the fellas
are startin' to ask.

640
00:33:47.776 --> 00:33:49.107
Molly runs the pub.

641
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.769
Oh. hi! Finley.

642
00:33:49.778 --> 00:33:52.440
Hey. it's where
I met me husband.

643
00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:53.527
A magical night.

644
00:33:53.532 --> 00:33:54.772
See. it's like everyone.

645
00:33:54.783 --> 00:33:58.617
Hey. I've been asked
a couple of times.

646
00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.200
Of course you have.

647
00:33:59.204 --> 00:34:02.196
You'll be there. Emma?
I mean. I know it's been

648
00:34:02.207 --> 00:34:04.072
difficult for you in the past.

649
00:34:04.084 --> 00:34:06.996
I mean. it was so sad. seeing
you alone last year. but.

650
00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:09.707
I mean. I can help you out.
if you want.

651
00:34:10.257 --> 00:34:13.124
But. I just got cast
in the new Beckett rush film.

652
00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:13.998
so. I just have to run on set

653
00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:16.338
and shoot some things
with Beckett and Taylor.

654
00:34:16.346 --> 00:34:18.883
But I'll. See you guys around.

655
00:34:19.641 --> 00:34:22.474
Get away from my shop.
you old drunk.

656
00:34:22.477 --> 00:34:24.342
Come on. Relax. Aileen.

657
00:34:24.354 --> 00:34:26.345
- Run.
- I was. I was gonna buy a book.

658
00:34:26.356 --> 00:34:28.142
Have you got any of those
romantic novels for sale?

659
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:29.855
- Get out of here. Go.
- All right. I'll leave.

660
00:34:29.859 --> 00:34:30.814
I'll leave.
I'll leave. I'll leave.

661
00:34:30.819 --> 00:34:33.606
And but I won't come back here
buy me books here anymore.

662
00:34:33.613 --> 00:34:35.854
You're scaring my customers.

663
00:34:36.324 --> 00:34:41.193
Well. good afternoon.
young ladies.

664
00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:43.035
Any chance
of the price of a pint

665
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:44.946
for a local struggling musician.

666
00:34:44.958 --> 00:34:47.825
who places his art
above all else?

667
00:34:47.836 --> 00:34:48.575
Look. I would. Seamus.

668
00:34:48.587 --> 00:34:52.500
But I only have
1.47 and a lollipop.

669
00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:53.417
Uh. Well. it's a start.

670
00:34:53.425 --> 00:34:57.009
Seamus. go sleep it off
in the back of the pub.

671
00:34:57.012 --> 00:34:57.751
Ah!

672
00:34:57.762 --> 00:34:59.172
You're right. Molly.

673
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.717
Thanks. but no thanks.

674
00:35:01.725 --> 00:35:02.840
Ladies!

675
00:35:02.851 --> 00:35:04.716
Got to take care
of me best customer.

676
00:35:04.728 --> 00:35:07.390
and tonight's
musical entertainment.

677
00:35:07.397 --> 00:35:10.013
He's been nappin' here
in the streets for years.

678
00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:11.265
He's got a little cottage
up the road.

679
00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:13.983
but he rarely makes it
back there at night.

680
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.361
What can you do?

681
00:35:16.364 --> 00:35:17.069
It's his life.

682
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:19.982
He'd rather buy fiddles
than pay the bills.

683
00:35:19.993 --> 00:35:22.655
Oh. I better help him.
Good luck!

684
00:35:48.605 --> 00:35:51.017
A convertible in Ireland?

685
00:35:51.024 --> 00:35:51.934
Yeah. I want to be ready

686
00:35:51.941 --> 00:35:54.478
for the three days a year
it doesn't rain.

687
00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:55.566
What are you doing?

688
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.232
I was actually
looking for that cross.

689
00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:00.946
Oh. you're not gonna
find it here.

690
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:02.281
How do you know?

691
00:36:02.285 --> 00:36:04.401
'Cause I already checked.

692
00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.071
Oh. Okay.

693
00:36:07.082 --> 00:36:08.538
But listen. I'm a little
worried about you

694
00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:10.406
hangin' out in graveyards
like this.

695
00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:11.248
It's pretty creepy.

696
00:36:11.252 --> 00:36:13.709
So. I'm gonna offer you a deal.

697
00:36:13.713 --> 00:36:14.577
Not interested.

698
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:16.295
Just hear me out. okay.

699
00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:17.334
You help me with my lines.

700
00:36:17.342 --> 00:36:20.254
and I'll be your personal
tour guide.

701
00:36:20.261 --> 00:36:22.502
Show you
all the sights of Ireland.

702
00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:23.924
Huh? Come on.

703
00:36:23.932 --> 00:36:25.923
It'll help sweet Mrs. Callahan
feel less guilty

704
00:36:25.934 --> 00:36:27.549
that she can't take you around.

705
00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.390
Totally harmless.

706
00:36:28.395 --> 00:36:31.262
Trust me. - No. I don't.

707
00:36:31.272 --> 00:36:31.977
No. no. no. no. no.

708
00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:33.266
I. I'm merely
a humble tour guide.

709
00:36:33.274 --> 00:36:37.517
And for a limited time only.
I'm gonna offer you a free tour.

710
00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:38.143
Just to make sure you know

711
00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:39.732
you're getting
the better end of the deal.

712
00:36:39.739 --> 00:36:40.444
So. come on. Let's go.

713
00:36:40.448 --> 00:36:42.154
I'm taking you
to the cliffs of moher.

714
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.610
I can't. We can't go now.

715
00:36:43.618 --> 00:36:45.279
Don't you have
a photoshoot to do?

716
00:36:45.286 --> 00:36:47.572
No. I told them I had to
help my boring friend

717
00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.241
learn how to have some fun.

718
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:52.457
Come on. Finley.

719
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.041
Take a risk.

720
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.957
You never know if
you're gonna have tomorrow.

721
00:37:02.345 --> 00:37:03.710
Okay.

722
00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:17.356
Here we are.
at the cliffs of moher.

723
00:37:19.154 --> 00:37:20.189
And what's that?

724
00:37:20.238 --> 00:37:23.071
This is my disguise. young lady.

725
00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:25.156
Pretty inconspicuous.
don't you think?

726
00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:29.906
Breathtaking cliffs ahead.

727
00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:31.905
and you're taking pictures
of grass. come on.

728
00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:35.204
Well. there's not
that much of it in Brooklyn.

729
00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:42.048
Is that Beckett rush?

730
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:45.839
Ugh. I was hoping for
just one day without this.

731
00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:46.927
Can we please get a selfie?

732
00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:51.220
Oh Johnny. don't you worry
about that nasty rash you have.

733
00:37:51.227 --> 00:37:51.761
I still love you.

734
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.726
- What is she saying?
- Oh franny. my dear.

735
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:54.810
Don't you think
we ought to get married?

736
00:37:54.814 --> 00:37:57.146
I think it's only right
after you gave me those twins

737
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.732
at the ripe young age of 16.

738
00:37:59.736 --> 00:38:00.896
I'm an unwed mother?

739
00:38:00.904 --> 00:38:04.192
I'm a diseased baby daddy.
What do you want from me?

740
00:38:04.199 --> 00:38:05.689
I think we should leave it.

741
00:38:09.537 --> 00:38:10.947
Okay. they're gone.

742
00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:13.662
You can let go of my hand now.

743
00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:15.873
You were holding on to me. Okay?

744
00:38:15.877 --> 00:38:16.707
Hmmm.

745
00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:18.872
Whatever. That was close.

746
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.916
Thanks a lot for protecting me.

747
00:38:20.924 --> 00:38:21.709
No problem.

748
00:38:21.716 --> 00:38:25.550
So. what's the big deal
with these cliffs anyway?

749
00:38:25.553 --> 00:38:26.042
Just you wait.

750
00:38:26.054 --> 00:38:28.010
Come on. hurry up. hurry up.

751
00:38:28.014 --> 00:38:29.254
Come on. come on. come on.

752
00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:32.556
Ah! See.

753
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.018
Now this. This is Ireland. huh.

754
00:38:36.022 --> 00:38:38.729
It's wild. It's amazing. it's.

755
00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:40.098
- Beautiful.
- I know.

756
00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:42.145
& don't be scared j

757
00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:44.235
j yeah you'll see j

758
00:38:44.239 --> 00:38:45.479
j we can play &

759
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.856
all right. come on.
There's better views up ahead.

760
00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:48.481
Come on. Come on.

761
00:38:48.493 --> 00:38:50.074
come on. come on.
J;' Yeah. here we go j

762
00:39:11.558 --> 00:39:13.970
Can I ask you
a personal question?

763
00:39:17.647 --> 00:39:21.481
Do you even really like
being a movie star?

764
00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:26.235
I mean. who wouldn't. right?

765
00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:29.564
It's not what I asked.

766
00:39:31.452 --> 00:39:33.113
What was it like
going to high school?

767
00:39:33.121 --> 00:39:39.458
Eh. it's. It's grueling.
and fun and weird.

768
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.291
all at once.

769
00:39:42.255 --> 00:39:44.166
That sounds amazing.

770
00:39:44.173 --> 00:39:45.288
Oh. yeah.

771
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.916
No. I mean it. You're lucky.

772
00:39:48.636 --> 00:39:51.423
Well. didn't you
go to school on set?

773
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:55.177
Usually. it was just me.

774
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.972
Sometimes. a few other
child actors and a tutor.

775
00:39:57.979 --> 00:40:00.721
But. No prom.

776
00:40:01.983 --> 00:40:03.598
No graduation.

777
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.566
No embarrassing gym class.

778
00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:08.152
Do you regret missing out on
that?

779
00:40:09.782 --> 00:40:11.522
I regret a lot of things.

780
00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:19.535
I bet those birds
don't regret anything. though?

781
00:40:21.502 --> 00:40:24.494
They're just. Free.

782
00:40:25.506 --> 00:40:29.670
I don't know. I guess sometimes
I just miss blending in.

783
00:40:29.677 --> 00:40:31.383
being normal. you know.

784
00:40:41.147 --> 00:40:42.853
There's the real Beckett.

785
00:40:58.081 --> 00:41:02.324
Rolling. quiet.
no moving around. turn over.

786
00:41:02.335 --> 00:41:05.372
Three. two. one. Action!

787
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.211
â€œWow!

788
00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:15.712
I'll have someone tell him
you're here.

789
00:41:16.683 --> 00:41:22.428
Oriana. it is not yet wise
to reveal your magical powers.

790
00:41:22.438 --> 00:41:22.927
Indeed.

791
00:41:22.939 --> 00:41:25.726
I will keep the men
until the time is right.

792
00:41:25.733 --> 00:41:27.189
Just like our love.

793
00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:32.857
Cut!

794
00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:37.905
Oh! Taylor. Beckett.
really great.

795
00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:40.073
You are marvelous. my dear.

796
00:41:40.081 --> 00:41:44.324
Finley!
Hey. what are you doing here?

797
00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:45.040
Did you sneak onto set?

798
00:41:45.044 --> 00:41:47.581
I mean. I'm not
going to tell anybody.

799
00:41:47.588 --> 00:41:48.794
No. Beckett invited me.

800
00:41:48.798 --> 00:41:52.757
I wonder what my girl Taylor
will have to say about that.

801
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.125
Finley! Hey!

802
00:41:54.137 --> 00:41:55.252
- Hey!
- You made it!

803
00:41:55.263 --> 00:41:57.094
So. uh. what do you think. uh?

804
00:41:57.098 --> 00:41:58.087
It's amazing.

805
00:41:58.099 --> 00:42:01.933
- Yeah.
- Hey babe. who's this?

806
00:42:01.936 --> 00:42:03.847
Finley. this is Taylor.

807
00:42:03.855 --> 00:42:06.187
Uh. she's here to help me out.

808
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:08.932
Kind of like an acting coach.
So.

809
00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:11.776
How kind! Ahem.

810
00:42:11.779 --> 00:42:15.943
So. what other actors
have you worked with before?

811
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:18.032
I actually haven't worked
with any other actors before.

812
00:42:18.036 --> 00:42:22.279
This is my first time on set.
but it seems pretty cool.

813
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:26.283
She's a real natural though.

814
00:42:26.294 --> 00:42:27.750
Interesting.

815
00:42:28.963 --> 00:42:32.046
We should probably go run the
lines for the next scene.

816
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:32.835
Come on. Finley. this way.

817
00:42:32.842 --> 00:42:35.333
It's a real honor
to meet you. Taylor.

818
00:42:35.344 --> 00:42:38.336
The pleasure is all mine.

819
00:42:38.347 --> 00:42:39.928
Come on. this side.

820
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:41.805
Tired from working
on set all day?

821
00:42:41.809 --> 00:42:46.303
Me. no! I am perfectly fine
'cause I did nothing.

822
00:42:46.314 --> 00:42:49.898
Well. that's what usually
happens on a movie set.

823
00:42:49.901 --> 00:42:51.641
Nobody does anything. Oh!

824
00:42:51.652 --> 00:42:54.644
Uh. is this
one of your girlfriends?

825
00:42:54.655 --> 00:42:55.735
Yeah. No. it's. uh.

826
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.321
- Beckett!
- My manager.

827
00:42:57.325 --> 00:42:58.485
They got me staying here
tonight.

828
00:42:58.493 --> 00:43:02.156
My hotel suite won't be ready
until tomorrow.

829
00:43:02.163 --> 00:43:04.324
Oh. hello. and you are?

830
00:43:04.332 --> 00:43:06.118
Hey. uh. Finley sinclair.

831
00:43:06.125 --> 00:43:08.366
I'm Beckett's father.
Montgomery.

832
00:43:08.377 --> 00:43:11.915
Oh! It's. So nice to meet you.

833
00:43:11.923 --> 00:43:14.630
It is an absolute pleasure
to meet you.

834
00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:16.214
Did you get those scripts
that I over-nighted?

835
00:43:16.219 --> 00:43:19.552
Yeah. the. uh. first two
dawn of the dragon spin-offs?

836
00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:21.053
You read them?

837
00:43:21.057 --> 00:43:23.298
Not yet. I've been kind of busy.

838
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:26.392
Yeah. the. uh. studio
is really. really.

839
00:43:26.395 --> 00:43:27.680
in love with
what you're doing on set.

840
00:43:27.688 --> 00:43:30.851
So. they made an official offer.
It's strong.

841
00:43:30.858 --> 00:43:32.894
Five movies over seven years.

842
00:43:32.902 --> 00:43:34.688
Oh!

843
00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:37.228
I don't know though.
Don't you think

844
00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.526
it's time to maybe
branch out a little?

845
00:43:39.534 --> 00:43:42.321
To what?
We're building an empire here.

846
00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:44.193
To something that shows
what I can really do.

847
00:43:44.205 --> 00:43:46.696
I mean. I want to do something
more than just sword fighting

848
00:43:46.707 --> 00:43:48.572
and outrunning fireballs.

849
00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:52.460
Oh. but you're so good at it.
That's what the fans wanna see.

850
00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.169
Right? Isn't that right?

851
00:43:54.173 --> 00:43:56.789
You have a very small window
to capitalize on this.

852
00:43:56.801 --> 00:43:58.712
Yeah. uh. I'll think about it.
for sure.

853
00:43:58.719 --> 00:44:00.801
Right now. we gotta
cash in on these sequels.

854
00:44:00.805 --> 00:44:02.136
So. hurry up
and read those scripts.

855
00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:02.970
All right. Let's do it.

856
00:44:02.974 --> 00:44:05.761
- Yeah. I will. I will.
- Yeah.

857
00:44:05.768 --> 00:44:08.180
Do they come out
and get your bags here or.?

858
00:44:08.396 --> 00:44:11.854
No. Uh. don't worry.
I've got it. dad.

859
00:44:11.858 --> 00:44:13.098
Okay. great.

860
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:14.815
So sorry to bore you
with all of that.

861
00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:17.811
I want to hear all about you.

862
00:44:17.822 --> 00:44:18.561
Where are you from?

863
00:44:18.573 --> 00:44:20.985
- Uh. New York.
- New York?

864
00:44:20.992 --> 00:44:22.482
The big apple.

865
00:44:26.289 --> 00:44:27.950
Good morning. Mrs. sweeney.

866
00:44:27.957 --> 00:44:30.243
And how are we today?

867
00:44:30.251 --> 00:44:32.082
I brought a twilight book.

868
00:44:32.086 --> 00:44:32.791
Who are you?

869
00:44:32.795 --> 00:44:36.128
Belinda did warn me that
you might pretend to be senile.

870
00:44:36.132 --> 00:44:38.544
Ah! I don't want the sun.

871
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:39.290
Oh. that explains it.

872
00:44:39.302 --> 00:44:40.917
The vampires
have gotten to you. too.

873
00:44:40.928 --> 00:44:42.714
You'll really like this book.

874
00:44:42.722 --> 00:44:44.963
I decide what I like.

875
00:44:44.974 --> 00:44:46.839
"It was 75 degrees in Phoenix.

876
00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:49.638
"The sky a perfect
cloudless blue.

877
00:44:49.645 --> 00:44:52.102
I was wearing my favorite shirt.
sleeveless..."

878
00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:55.269
It's cold. I want to go inside.

879
00:44:55.276 --> 00:44:56.561
Ah.

880
00:44:57.945 --> 00:45:03.656
You know. Mrs. sweeney. uh.
Who is Fiona Doyle?

881
00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:06.317
What?
That's none of your business.

882
00:45:06.329 --> 00:45:07.284
Oh. yeah. I just. I thought

883
00:45:07.288 --> 00:45:09.995
that maybe I could help you
find the right address.

884
00:45:09.999 --> 00:45:12.365
I have the right address.

885
00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:15.584
- Then why?
- I don't want to discuss it.

886
00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:17.791
Okay.

887
00:45:17.798 --> 00:45:20.915
You've been snooping
in my drawers.

888
00:45:23.262 --> 00:45:23.842
Uh.

889
00:45:23.846 --> 00:45:25.552
What's up. ladies?

890
00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:28.047
Groovy day.
don't you think. man?

891
00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:29.640
Hmm. Convincing.

892
00:45:29.644 --> 00:45:31.225
Do you need directions
to Woodstock?

893
00:45:31.229 --> 00:45:35.222
Whoa. whoa. sister!
Give peace a chance.

894
00:45:35.233 --> 00:45:38.350
Mrs. sweeney.
this is Beckett rush.

895
00:45:38.361 --> 00:45:41.068
He's an actor in dragon movies.

896
00:45:41.072 --> 00:45:43.688
Mrs. sweeney.
it's very lovely to meet you.

897
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:45.231
I've heard a lot about you.

898
00:45:45.243 --> 00:45:48.827
Yes! I've seen you
on television.

899
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:50.569
You're in love
with the Princess.

900
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:53.493
Um. hey.
I brought you some treats

901
00:45:53.501 --> 00:45:55.867
because I know they're not
givin' you the good stuff here.

902
00:45:55.878 --> 00:45:57.664
Although I know it's
nothing like your cooking.

903
00:45:57.672 --> 00:46:00.163
You're probably a wiz
in the kitchen.

904
00:46:00.174 --> 00:46:02.381
Baking is my specialty.

905
00:46:02.385 --> 00:46:05.252
Sugar and spice. my kinda lady.

906
00:46:05.263 --> 00:46:05.718
Huh!

907
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:08.379
You really
can't turn it off. can you?

908
00:46:08.391 --> 00:46:11.554
There's nothing wrong with
spreading a little cheer.

909
00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.221
Come on. make love. not war.

910
00:46:13.229 --> 00:46:16.096
Tell me.
when did you start acting?

911
00:46:16.107 --> 00:46:20.692
Uh. I was seven years old.
My father got me into it.

912
00:46:20.695 --> 00:46:21.275
No!

913
00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:22.735
Do you ever do any acting?

914
00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.439
Oh. yes.

915
00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:24.857
What was your first role?

916
00:46:24.865 --> 00:46:27.447
At school. I played
the white rabbit.

917
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:28.566
The white rabbit.

918
00:46:28.577 --> 00:46:30.113
You look kinda like
the white rabbit.

919
00:46:30.913 --> 00:46:34.201
You're funny. You're a twit.

920
00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:39.828
Mwah. - Aww. Thank you so much.

921
00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:42.876
All right. thanks
for letting me stop by. guys.

922
00:46:42.883 --> 00:46:44.339
Okay. Peace out.

923
00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:47.551
Peace.

924
00:46:47.555 --> 00:46:49.091
He's a fine young man.

925
00:46:49.098 --> 00:46:49.712
He's a total player.

926
00:46:49.724 --> 00:46:54.718
Ah! Don't tell me I don't know
what I'm talking about.

927
00:46:54.729 --> 00:46:56.265
He's a good boy.

928
00:46:56.272 --> 00:46:59.059
I can spot a bad one
a mile away.

929
00:46:59.066 --> 00:47:01.933
Now. carry on reading your book.

930
00:47:06.073 --> 00:47:11.113
"In the olympic peninsula
of northwest Washington state."

931
00:47:14.081 --> 00:47:14.661
Let's go.

932
00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:17.873
Thank god we've kept Beckett
hidden from them so far.

933
00:47:20.004 --> 00:47:21.164
Hey.

934
00:47:21.172 --> 00:47:24.005
Do you know much
about Mrs. sweeney?

935
00:47:25.426 --> 00:47:29.339
I don't like to say things
if I've got nothing nice to say.

936
00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:35.095
Well. she's not that bad.

937
00:47:35.102 --> 00:47:36.933
No. she's not bad.

938
00:47:38.314 --> 00:47:39.770
She's terrible.

939
00:47:43.903 --> 00:47:46.440
So then. who's Fiona Doyle?

940
00:47:46.447 --> 00:47:47.903
Her sister.

941
00:47:47.907 --> 00:47:49.113
Oh.

942
00:47:49.116 --> 00:47:52.529
Mrs. sweeney really wants
to get in touch with her.

943
00:47:53.454 --> 00:47:54.443
What happened there?

944
00:47:54.455 --> 00:47:59.245
I heard cathleen sweeney
stole her own sister's fiancÃ©.

945
00:48:00.669 --> 00:48:04.127
I mean. who would do
such a thing?

946
00:48:04.131 --> 00:48:05.621
I'm saying no more.

947
00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:10.176
Then. she left him. a few years
after they get married.

948
00:48:10.179 --> 00:48:11.168
He was heartbroken.

949
00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.796
They say he drank himself
to death not long after.

950
00:48:13.808 --> 00:48:15.890
That's it. I'm saying no more.

951
00:48:16.268 --> 00:48:19.635
But if Mrs. sweeney
is the man stealer.

952
00:48:19.647 --> 00:48:23.139
then why is she the one
that's so bitter?

953
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:25.857
Just gettin' what she deserved.
I guess.

954
00:48:50.344 --> 00:48:52.426
It's your friendly
Irish tour guide.

955
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.964
Ah! Hey!

956
00:48:52.972 --> 00:48:53.882
Let's take this out of your
hands.

957
00:48:53.889 --> 00:48:56.596
Um. let's actually be
really careful with that.

958
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.305
Oh. we don't really need it

959
00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:58.912
because I have got
the rest of the week off.

960
00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:00.597
and it's time
for your next tour.

961
00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.720
We're about to have ourselves
some real Irish fun.

962
00:49:02.731 --> 00:49:04.642
It's not a good idea
for me to be going out

963
00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:06.515
to one of your
exclusive nightclubs

964
00:49:06.527 --> 00:49:08.563
or whatever it is you do.

965
00:49:08.571 --> 00:49:10.027
And who says that
I'm into nightclubs?

966
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.817
Uh. every tabloid in
the supermarket checkout line.

967
00:49:12.825 --> 00:49:15.111
Well. don't believe
everything you read.

968
00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:17.451
Beckett.
I-1 really have to practice.

969
00:49:17.455 --> 00:49:18.865
Hey. as your tour guide.
it's my job

970
00:49:18.873 --> 00:49:21.489
to make sure you don't spend
all of your time in Ireland

971
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.364
cooped up in this room.

972
00:49:22.376 --> 00:49:23.786
It's what you find
outside of this place

973
00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:27.912
that's gonna help you
write your try-out song.

974
00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:28.545
It's a composition.

975
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:34.510
Whatever. God. you are
so uptight.

976
00:49:34.513 --> 00:49:35.047
No I'm not.

977
00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:38.343
Oh yeah. you kind of are.

978
00:49:41.437 --> 00:49:43.803
Fine. Where are we going?

979
00:49:44.523 --> 00:49:46.684
You will see. milady.
Come on. let's go.

980
00:49:46.692 --> 00:49:48.057
Ahem. I'm not even dressed!

981
00:49:48.068 --> 00:49:50.605
No. no. you are perfect
just the way you are.

982
00:49:50.613 --> 00:49:53.150
Come on. let's go.
We're gonna be late.

983
00:49:53.157 --> 00:49:53.612
Wait.

984
00:49:53.616 --> 00:49:56.653
This is my favorite place
in all of Ireland.

985
00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.902
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

986
00:49:59.914 --> 00:50:00.914
Trust me.

987
00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:05.746
Oh! Good golly. Mrs. Molly!
I've missed you!

988
00:50:05.753 --> 00:50:07.664
If it isn't me favorite fella!

989
00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.582
Finley! - Hi. Molly.

990
00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:10.921
Give everybody a round on me!

991
00:50:10.925 --> 00:50:12.256
Drinks are on me.

992
00:50:14.178 --> 00:50:15.918
Cole. you stand guard
at the door.

993
00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:18.091
Make sure no reporters
get in here.

994
00:50:18.098 --> 00:50:21.261
Beckett rush rules! No pictures!

995
00:50:21.268 --> 00:50:23.099
These guys are great.

996
00:50:23.103 --> 00:50:23.762
Where's Seamus?

997
00:50:23.771 --> 00:50:26.353
Uh. he's already
had a few pints.

998
00:50:29.777 --> 00:50:31.563
Looks like it's time
to wake him up then.

999
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:34.858
Come on. You could learn
a thing or two from this guy.

1000
00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:36.071
What am I gonna learn from him?

1001
00:50:36.075 --> 00:50:39.943
He's like. Homeless. And drunk.

1002
00:50:39.954 --> 00:50:41.819
You'll see. Don't worry.

1003
00:50:46.293 --> 00:50:47.999
Seamus!

1004
00:50:48.003 --> 00:50:51.495
Oh Molly. let me just
crash here tonight. will you?

1005
00:50:51.507 --> 00:50:53.998
Oh. you can
crash with me any time.

1006
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.342
Oh. it's you. boy.

1007
00:50:57.346 --> 00:50:58.210
What do you want?

1008
00:50:58.222 --> 00:50:59.507
Well. what do you think I want?

1009
00:50:59.515 --> 00:51:01.130
I want you to get this party
started!

1010
00:51:01.141 --> 00:51:02.256
I brought this
American girl here

1011
00:51:02.268 --> 00:51:05.635
to show her some real Irish fun.

1012
00:51:05.646 --> 00:51:06.646
We can do that.

1013
00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:28.501
â€œWhoo!

1014
00:51:41.015 --> 00:51:42.425
He's great.

1015
00:51:54.236 --> 00:51:56.522
Oh. I'm told we've got
a fine young Fiddler player

1016
00:51:57.698 --> 00:52:00.440
can you go up
and give us a tune. please.

1017
00:52:00.743 --> 00:52:03.075
No. no. no.
I-1-1 don't play fiddle.

1018
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:03.700
I play the violin.

1019
00:52:03.704 --> 00:52:06.320
Oh. fiddle. faddle. fuddle.
whatever you call it.

1020
00:52:06.332 --> 00:52:06.991
it doesn't matter.

1021
00:52:06.999 --> 00:52:09.035
Come on up here
and join us. lass.

1022
00:52:09.043 --> 00:52:10.158
Oh. come on. go up there.

1023
00:52:10.169 --> 00:52:13.081
- Come on.
- Come on. girl!

1024
00:52:13.088 --> 00:52:14.544
We won't bite ya!

1025
00:52:15.257 --> 00:52:15.871
Come on.

1026
00:52:15.883 --> 00:52:17.669
Give her a round
of applause. everybody.

1027
00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.585
I'm going to kill you.

1028
00:52:21.597 --> 00:52:22.712
Yeah. That's fine.

1029
00:52:22.723 --> 00:52:25.089
Just. After you play.

1030
00:52:25.601 --> 00:52:28.468
Now. repeat after me.

1031
00:52:48.082 --> 00:52:51.825
Now. you're in a pub in Ireland.
not in an orchestra.

1032
00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:52.494
Enjoy yourself.

1033
00:52:52.503 --> 00:52:54.414
Doesn't matter what your fingers
or the notes are.

1034
00:52:54.421 --> 00:52:56.878
It's how you play them. right.

1035
00:52:56.882 --> 00:52:58.247
Play them with your heart.

1036
00:52:58.258 --> 00:52:59.338
Play it like you feel it.

1037
00:52:59.343 --> 00:53:00.799
If you feel it. they will.

1038
00:53:00.803 --> 00:53:02.293
Do you love that instrument?

1039
00:53:02.304 --> 00:53:03.965
- Yeah.
- Then show them you love it.

1040
00:53:03.972 --> 00:53:06.429
and then you'll have them
wrapped around your finger.

1041
00:53:06.433 --> 00:53:08.719
All right. Here we go. boys.

1042
00:53:20.989 --> 00:53:22.320
That's it.

1043
00:53:25.327 --> 00:53:29.240
All right.

1044
00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:58.649
Hey! Well done! Well done. dear!

1045
00:54:00.654 --> 00:54:03.111
Great stuff. great stuff.

1046
00:54:03.782 --> 00:54:04.487
Oh. you did great.

1047
00:54:04.491 --> 00:54:05.822
Now I hope you'll come
and join us again next week.

1048
00:54:05.826 --> 00:54:09.159
There's a Fiddler in there.
and we need to let her out.

1049
00:54:09.163 --> 00:54:12.121
You know the name.
show what's inside in you.

1050
00:54:12.124 --> 00:54:13.113
What's your name?

1051
00:54:13.125 --> 00:54:13.739
Finley sinclair.

1052
00:54:13.751 --> 00:54:16.208
Finley. Now that means
â€œfair warrior...

1053
00:54:16.211 --> 00:54:18.953
No wonder you were brave enough
to come on stage with us.

1054
00:54:18.964 --> 00:54:20.329
Well. that's pretty interesting.

1055
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:21.625
What's my name mean. Seamus?

1056
00:54:21.633 --> 00:54:27.048
Beckett. it means.
uh. bee cottage or bee hive.

1057
00:54:27.055 --> 00:54:28.135
Means you're probably descended

1058
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:30.176
from a long line
of irritating pests.

1059
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:41.437
And wow!

1060
00:54:41.779 --> 00:54:43.019
That was absolutely amazing.

1061
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:46.238
I've never heard
anything like it.

1062
00:54:46.283 --> 00:54:47.773
He plays with
everything he's got.

1063
00:54:47.785 --> 00:54:50.197
Not bad for a homeless
old drunk. huh?

1064
00:54:50.204 --> 00:54:51.159
I stand corrected.

1065
00:54:51.163 --> 00:54:55.406
Wow. you are really beautiful
when you admit that I'm right.

1066
00:54:56.251 --> 00:54:57.536
Did you plan this?

1067
00:54:57.544 --> 00:54:59.409
No. not at all.

1068
00:55:00.172 --> 00:55:00.911
Okay. Maybe a little.

1069
00:55:00.923 --> 00:55:03.539
Thank you. That was sweet.

1070
00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:05.711
Sneaky. but. Still sweet.

1071
00:55:05.719 --> 00:55:08.426
Finley sinclair.
you're actually not so bad

1072
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.261
when you decide
to have some fun.

1073
00:55:10.265 --> 00:55:11.425
You're not so bad yourself.

1074
00:55:11.433 --> 00:55:13.048
But we can't get involved.

1075
00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:13.890
No. definitely not.

1076
00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:15.134
I couldn't possibly
be a good guy.

1077
00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:16.726
And I'm trying
to be a good girl.

1078
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.516
And we don't even
like each other.

1079
00:55:18.524 --> 00:55:20.936
We're just too different.

1080
00:55:20.943 --> 00:55:22.479
It would never work.

1081
00:55:23.612 --> 00:55:25.193
It'd be impossible.

1082
00:55:44.424 --> 00:55:46.460
Wow! Thank you.

1083
00:55:46.468 --> 00:55:48.959
That was actually a lot of fun.

1084
00:55:50.597 --> 00:55:55.307
But. um. we should probably
keep tonight between you and me.

1085
00:55:55.352 --> 00:55:57.718
I don't want you to get
dragged into the public eye.

1086
00:55:57.729 --> 00:55:59.720
Of course. probably just another

1087
00:55:59.731 --> 00:56:01.642
meaningless kiss
for you anyway. so...

1088
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:05.313
No. it. It wasn't.

1089
00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.651
Trust me.

1090
00:56:08.115 --> 00:56:10.322
I don't.

1091
00:56:13.787 --> 00:56:15.493
Goodnight. fair warrior.

1092
00:56:15.497 --> 00:56:17.158
Goodnight. bee cottage.

1093
00:56:28.927 --> 00:56:30.292
Get in here. I saw that!

1094
00:56:30.304 --> 00:56:31.965
What is going on with you two?

1095
00:56:31.972 --> 00:56:35.305
You can't say
anything to anyone.

1096
00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:37.095
You kissed him?

1097
00:56:37.102 --> 00:56:38.308
You did? You kissed him.

1098
00:56:38.312 --> 00:56:40.223
I can't even barely
still talk to him.

1099
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:41.310
and you kissed him.

1100
00:56:41.315 --> 00:56:44.227
My sister kissed Beckett. Shhh.

1101
00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:47.271
Definitely keep this
from my parents.

1102
00:56:47.279 --> 00:56:48.485
It's rather obvious.

1103
00:56:48.488 --> 00:56:50.570
You two have been
all googly eyed for each other

1104
00:56:50.574 --> 00:56:52.235
the last few weeks.

1105
00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:53.698
But I'll keep it classified.

1106
00:56:53.702 --> 00:56:54.987
Especially from mom.

1107
00:56:54.995 --> 00:56:56.860
What planet
do you think I live on?

1108
00:56:56.872 --> 00:56:59.079
A blind man
could see that comin'.

1109
00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:01.665
Really. it's-it's
probably nothing.

1110
00:57:01.668 --> 00:57:05.456
I mean. I don't even think
he meant anything by it.

1111
00:57:05.464 --> 00:57:07.580
Either way. this can't get out.

1112
00:57:07.591 --> 00:57:11.175
If it does. there's no way
he's still staying with us.

1113
00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.177
And I don't want any
late-night shenanigans.

1114
00:57:14.181 --> 00:57:16.092
Your mother would have my hide.

1115
00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:17.384
Hmm.

1116
00:57:17.392 --> 00:57:19.178
Would you look at that?

1117
00:57:20.479 --> 00:57:22.060
They look good together.

1118
00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:31.354
J everybody holds the moment j

1119
00:57:33.075 --> 00:57:36.613
j everyone chases the day j

1120
00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:44.249
j you can see it
if you close your eyes j

1121
00:57:44.252 --> 00:57:47.039
j we already know the way j

1122
00:57:52.719 --> 00:57:55.381
J forever you and me j

1123
00:57:55.389 --> 00:57:56.595
- Finley. I'm warning you.
- I'll go to work

1124
00:57:56.598 --> 00:57:57.883
if you don't have the money.

1125
00:57:57.891 --> 00:58:03.727
& running wild and free
chasing down inside &

1126
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:06.312
; Oh we just begun &

1127
00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:10.025
j it's rhyme and roll
around the place I

1128
00:58:10.028 --> 00:58:12.235
j as we will go &

1129
00:58:12.239 --> 00:58:13.900
you really showed him
this time still

1130
00:58:13.907 --> 00:58:16.114
that dragon won't be back
in any hurt.

1131
00:58:16.118 --> 00:58:17.983
Oh. you can say that. Arthur.

1132
00:58:17.995 --> 00:58:19.656
Oh. Steele.
our dragon seems to have

1133
00:58:19.663 --> 00:58:22.621
struck the deal with them
whereby they are.

1134
00:58:22.624 --> 00:58:24.865
What? Arthur. what?

1135
00:58:24.876 --> 00:58:25.876
Spit it out!

1136
00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:41.757
This place is super cool.
one of my favorite spots.

1137
00:58:41.768 --> 00:58:43.850
You gotta go under
for good luck. Quick.

1138
00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:49.773
Okay. so this is called
the 'miracle pride'.

1139
00:58:53.113 --> 00:58:54.944
You had fun today? Yes.

1140
00:58:54.948 --> 00:58:56.063
So. what do you think about

1141
00:58:56.074 --> 00:58:57.939
letting your tour guide
take you on a date?

1142
00:58:57.951 --> 00:58:59.191
J we will go &

1143
00:58:59.202 --> 00:59:01.238
seems harmless enough.

1144
00:59:17.179 --> 00:59:21.297
Well. it was either this or
fish and chips at the pub. so.

1145
00:59:21.308 --> 00:59:23.720
Wow. this is so much better.

1146
00:59:24.519 --> 00:59:25.804
How did you do all of this?

1147
00:59:25.812 --> 00:59:28.519
Well. I had a little bit
of help from some friends.

1148
00:59:28.565 --> 00:59:30.146
My lady.

1149
00:59:30.859 --> 00:59:31.689
Hello.

1150
00:59:31.693 --> 00:59:33.399
- Hi!
- There you go.

1151
00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:34.609
Thank you so much. Ciara.

1152
00:59:34.613 --> 00:59:35.693
You are very welcome.

1153
00:59:35.697 --> 00:59:37.813
Have a good night.
Thank you. Ciara.

1154
00:59:37.824 --> 00:59:39.735
See you guys.

1155
00:59:41.578 --> 00:59:44.240
Well. bon appetit.

1156
00:59:50.378 --> 00:59:51.959
You have to try this. okay.

1157
00:59:51.963 --> 00:59:54.705
Just come here. come here.
Trust me.

1158
00:59:57.052 --> 00:59:59.384
All right.
Make sure you're in there.

1159
00:59:59.387 --> 01:00:00.046
- Um...
- Good?

1160
01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:02.888
Yeah. uh. are you sure
you know what you're doing?

1161
01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:03.755
Don't worry about it.

1162
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.177
I grew up on these things. okay.

1163
01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:08.677
Um. yeah. I-the problem is.
I'm just.

1164
01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:12.472
heights?

1165
01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:16.351
Here I come.

1166
01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:19.529
It's not so bad. is it?

1167
01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:23.196
- Yes. it is.
- We're flying. Finley. come on.

1168
01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.536
Oh. he's so good at this.

1169
01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.872
I wonder why. Legs up. leg's up.

1170
01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.581
Let it spin. let it spin.

1171
01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:33.243
There you go. you did it.

1172
01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:35.712
Just don't look down.

1173
01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:36.715
See.

1174
01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:49.517
Okay.

1175
01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:50.852
I got you. I got you.

1176
01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:55.190
See. that wasn't so bad now.
was it?

1177
01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:57.229
No. it was fun.

1178
01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:02.739
So. what do you want to do
if you ever stopped acting?

1179
01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:05.484
It's a waste of time
to even think about it.

1180
01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.406
It's not really an option.

1181
01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:11.038
Well. what if it were?

1182
01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:14.960
Maybe go to college.
Study history.

1183
01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:18.797
I just want to live
a normal life for once.

1184
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.212
Wouldn't you miss
all your dragons?

1185
01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:38.062
My love. you're injured.

1186
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:42.608
It's only a flesh wound
from a dragon's claw.

1187
01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:43.651
It will heal.

1188
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.237
I cannot say the same
for your father's castle.

1189
01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:48.781
You have defended it valiantly.

1190
01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:52.664
I believe in you.

1191
01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:54.077
I believe in us.

1192
01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:57.168
I will fight for your love
until the end of time.

1193
01:01:58.006 --> 01:01:59.462
Cut!

1194
01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.506
Print! Moving on!

1195
01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.796
Taylor. very special.

1196
01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:11.049
Thank you. my darling.
you my frame.

1197
01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:14.053
You are so money. Fantastic.

1198
01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:14.974
How did you do it?

1199
01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:20.942
You're 100% animal.
0% vegetable.

1200
01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:22.277
Gorgeous.

1201
01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:28.818
It's. Delicious.
You taste of victory.

1202
01:02:28.828 --> 01:02:31.661
I need a little
sparkling water. please.

1203
01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:34.077
I felt that. Beck.

1204
01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:35.449
Thanks. tay.

1205
01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.950
You did great too.

1206
01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.792
Very strong performance. son.

1207
01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:42.209
Thanks. dad.

1208
01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:45.133
They were crying at the monitor.

1209
01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:48.007
Seriously.

1210
01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:48.924
Does that feel good?

1211
01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:50.843
Yeah. yeah. it felt great.

1212
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.181
I1t should.

1213
01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:54.392
Yeah. everyone's very
impressed with your work.

1214
01:02:54.396 --> 01:02:55.636
You have a lot of leverage
right now.

1215
01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:59.014
You should really
sign those contracts.

1216
01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:00.356
I guess.

1217
01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:04.482
Hey. you're trending.
Have you seen the article?

1218
01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:05.478
No. I was busy.

1219
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:06.946
With your assistant?

1220
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.531
No. Just busy.

1221
01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:11.026
Hm-mm. Here it is.

1222
01:03:11.037 --> 01:03:12.698
"Beckett rush

1223
01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:14.196

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:23.539
R 'n ris officially
on the rocks."

1227
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:27.042
Yeah. and my name
is officially trashed again.

1228
01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:29.294
Your movie sales
spiked five percent.

1229
01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:31.342
You should be thanking me.

1230
01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:43.733
Um. so. you know.
things with the hippie guy

1231
01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:46.023
are going interesting.

1232
01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:51.242
Oh. and I'm still taking violin
lessons from Seamus. Of course.

1233
01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:52.279
he calls it the fiddle.

1234
01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:55.154
Oh. next time you come.
bring the fiddle.

1235
01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:59.204
I'd like to hear
if you're any good.

1236
01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:02.873
Yeah. I will.

1237
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:16.934
Um. Mrs. sweeney.
I-l heard about what happened

1238
01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:19.097
between you and your sister.

1239
01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:23.978
No. stay out of my business.

1240
01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:34.781
I mean. you are just
the grumpiest woman

1241
01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:36.574
I have ever met
in my entire life.

1242
01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:39.493
I know something. you know.
made you that way. right!

1243
01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:45.371
And what they said you did is.
Well. it's pretty shady but.

1244
01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:49.257
No. no. you know what.
n-none of this makes sense.

1245
01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.501
I know that you care
about Fiona.

1246
01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:53.799
so I'm gonna help you.
no matter what.

1247
01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.843
I don't want your help!

1248
01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:57.386
Leave me alone!

1249
01:04:58.186 --> 01:04:59.676
What?

1250
01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:01.097
I'm dying.

1251
01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:04.434
What?

1252
01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:08.192
Canceur.

1253
01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:10.778
I've only awhile to live.

1254
01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:14.027
Why didn't you say anything?

1255
01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:26.540
Hey! You're late.

1256
01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:28.664
I know. But I just.
I came from Mrs. sweeney and...

1257
01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:30.836
Let's just run the lines. okay.

1258
01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:32.175
Please.

1259
01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:34.924
Okay.

1260
01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:36.549
Umm.

1261
01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:40.142
Well. well. well. how is my
son's lovely assistant doing?

1262
01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:42.557
I'm more of an acting partner.

1263
01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:44.395
Oh. I used to be an actor.

1264
01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:47.516
I mean. things have changed
a lot since then.

1265
01:05:47.527 --> 01:05:51.520
I think it's so kind
how you sacrificed so much

1266
01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:53.067
for Beckett's career.

1267
01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:53.688
He was a natural.

1268
01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:58.034
I mean. he needed to be in la
to make his dream a reality.

1269
01:05:58.037 --> 01:06:01.325
I don't ever remember saying
I wanted to be an actor.

1270
01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:01.912
You did.

1271
01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:04.703
"Dad. I want to be in movies"
is exactly what you said.

1272
01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:06.542
I mean. I was six years old.

1273
01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:10.038
I also said I wanted to be
an astronaut and a giraffe.

1274
01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:14.209
Excuse me. Beckett.
they're ready for you on set.

1275
01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:20.389
I'll be right back. okay.

1276
01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:23.055
Actually. I need to leave too.

1277
01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:26.680
I could really use your help
on this scene after we shoot.

1278
01:06:27.358 --> 01:06:29.690
I need to do something
for Mrs. sweeney.

1279
01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:32.561
Beck. we need you on set.

1280
01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:34.278
Yeah.

1281
01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:35.863
Sorry.

1282
01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:49.711
Finley. Hey!

1283
01:06:50.882 --> 01:06:52.793
You seem like
a really nice girl.

1284
01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.758
And I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

1285
01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:59.380
This kind of thing happens
all the time.

1286
01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:02.382
Uh. What-what
do you mean by that?

1287
01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:06.261
I just suggest you keep things
very professional with Beckett.

1288
01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:07.933
He's with Taylor.

1289
01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:12.935
Is he that. I just. it doesn't
really seem like he is.

1290
01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:15.779
No. they'll be back together
again very soon.

1291
01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:17.989
Oh. okay.

1292
01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:23.077
So. you manipulate his career
and his love life?

1293
01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:27.616
His love life is his career.

1294
01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:30.118
So. if you really
care about him.

1295
01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:34.001
Don't get in the way.

1296
01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:57.482
- Seamus!
- Hey!

1297
01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:00.482
No broom; No broom. Huh!

1298
01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:01.824
Finley?

1299
01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:03.992
What are you doing here?

1300
01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:08.366
I-1-i need you to tell me
where Fiona Doyle lives.

1301
01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:08.831
Fiona?

1302
01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:11.497
What are you doing with
those bickering old ladies?

1303
01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.961
I-I need to help Mrs. sweeney.

1304
01:08:14.966 --> 01:08:17.332
Why? No one else ever has.

1305
01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:17.877
I know. I know.

1306
01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:19.125
And that's what
I don't understand.

1307
01:08:19.137 --> 01:08:21.844
Why does everyone
hate her so much?

1308
01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:27.309
Cathleen sweeney.

1309
01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:30.850
Cathleen
was an absolute stunner.

1310
01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:32.597
She was the best-looking girl
in the town.

1311
01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:37.444
And it was no surprise that she
was able to lure Charles sweeney

1312
01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.688
away from
her sweet little sister.

1313
01:08:39.699 --> 01:08:43.738
When he died shortly
after cathleen had left him.

1314
01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:48.580
the whole town blamed her
and she had not a friend left.

1315
01:08:48.583 --> 01:08:53.077
She was shunned by everybody.
even by her own family.

1316
01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:56.830
Now. no one wants the opinion
of an old fiddle player.

1317
01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:59.924
Between you and I.
I think there was more going on.

1318
01:08:59.927 --> 01:09:03.215
It just didn't add up.
you know what I mean.

1319
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:07.056
Here. show me your map.

1320
01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:09.842
Oh. I hate these things.

1321
01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:10.434
Sorry.

1322
01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:13.555
Look. she lives in a little farm

1323
01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:14.601
just outside of town.

1324
01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:17.567
Now it's a hell of
a bicycle ride up the hill.

1325
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:18.229
but you never know.

1326
01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:20.398
we might be able
to figure something out.

1327
01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:20.940
Hmmm.

1328
01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:22.939
What time does Connor come by
to pick up the empty kegs?

1329
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:25.282
He said he'd be here
half an hour ago.

1330
01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:26.992
He should be here any minute.

1331
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:54.474
Thanks.

1332
01:10:08.413 --> 01:10:09.653
Uh. have you come for the pig?

1333
01:10:09.664 --> 01:10:13.122
Uh. no. Hi. I'm Finley sinclair.

1334
01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:15.583
I'm a friend of your sister's.

1335
01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:17.292
I don't have a sister.

1336
01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:20.129
Uh. please wait.

1337
01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:23.500
Cathleen"s dying of bone cancer.

1338
01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:25.627
She doesn't have much time.

1339
01:10:25.638 --> 01:10:28.050
She got what was coming to her.

1340
01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:29.547
Did she make you come here?

1341
01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:32.266
No. She has no idea
that I'm here.

1342
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:34.306
Cathleen ceased to be my sister

1343
01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:37.305
the moment she went
after that man.

1344
01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:40.808
So now. good day to you.

1345
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.611
So0. what? She's got only
a few weeks left to live?

1346
01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:53.112
I just...
I don't know what to do.

1347
01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:57.117
Now. miss sweeney won't talk.
and Fiona won't listen.

1348
01:10:57.128 --> 01:11:00.211
So. I'm stuck.

1349
01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:03.627
Our latest post just reached
a million likes.

1350
01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:05.374
I forgave you.

1351
01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:09.470
You know. it reminds me
of that picture

1352
01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:12.307
we took in Paris
when we were 15.

1353
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:14.175
Yeah. Yeah.

1354
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:19.222
Hey Beckett. Taylor.
they're ready for you on set.

1355
01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.560
Thanks.

1356
01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:26.359
Look. Finley.
can we just talk later?

1357
01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:29.107
Yeah. of course. yeah.

1358
01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:32.030
Hey. look at all these
articles about us.

1359
01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:35.530
Beckett rushes back to risdale.
R 'n r returns.

1360
01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:39.750
Beckett begs for Taylor
to come back. and she does.

1361
01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.121
This is very good for us.

1362
01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:03.232
Finley!

1363
01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:06.568
Finley. I called you
like a hundred times.

1364
01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:08.938
I'm trying to talk to you.

1365
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:10.065
I'm busy. Running.

1366
01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:12.909
What? So. you just run away
when things get hard?

1367
01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:14.277
Not exactly a warrior.

1368
01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:16.244
I thought it wasn't safe
for you to be out here

1369
01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:17.409
without a disguise.

1370
01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:19.077
I'll be fine.

1371
01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:21.747
Hey! We need to talk.

1372
01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:22.743
Please.

1373
01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:23.244
About what?

1374
01:12:23.256 --> 01:12:25.918
You and Taylor hanging all over
each other on social media?

1375
01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:28.086
I told you it's not
what it looks like.

1376
01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:29.550
Okay. just trust me.

1377
01:12:29.554 --> 01:12:32.136
Are you and Taylor
together or not?

1378
01:12:40.815 --> 01:12:41.429
Hey!

1379
01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.850
Can we please have a picture?

1380
01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:44.224
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1381
01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:48.944
- Thank you.
- All right.

1382
01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:51.280
Did everybody get one?
Bye. thank you. bye.

1383
01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:53.400
Thank you. guys. see ya.

1384
01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:54.776
Finley!

1385
01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:56.994
Finley. Finley.

1386
01:12:56.998 --> 01:12:59.956
I'm trying to work through
all of this. okay.

1387
01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:01.824
But this is bigger than just me.

1388
01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:03.792
My life isn't always my own.

1389
01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:07.084
I mean. my father.
he has an entire team of people

1390
01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:08.251
organizing my public life.

1391
01:13:08.259 --> 01:13:12.753
You just don't understand. okay.
I have no control.

1392
01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:14.924
It doesn't answer my question.

1393
01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:18.553
Are you and Taylor
together or not?

1394
01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:27.017
Ouir first film together
didn't do so well.

1395
01:13:27.028 --> 01:13:28.734
The studio was about to lose
a lot of money.

1396
01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:32.572
And then. my dad came up
with this brilliant idea

1397
01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:35.817
of a stormy relationship
between Taylor and I.

1398
01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.031
It started with a lot of truth.

1399
01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:41.577
But then. my dad
just started making things up.

1400
01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:43.916
And before I knew it.
I had this whole other persona.

1401
01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:48.129
The worst part of it is.
it worked.

1402
01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:49.838
It saved the film.

1403
01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:54.427
So. it is all fake.

1404
01:13:57.308 --> 01:14:01.927
I can't be with a guy who has
this entire made-up life.

1405
01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:05.977
And I told you I can't do
anything about that right now.

1406
01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:14.610
I've always wanted to
ask a girl to a dance.

1407
01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:17.404
And this weekend. there's
the St. finian's festival.

1408
01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:20.778
And I would love it
if you would come with me.

1409
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.581
In public?

1410
01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:25.870
Yeah.

1411
01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:28.586
No disguises?

1412
01:14:28.589 --> 01:14:29.749
No disguises needed.

1413
01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:32.248
although I am pretty good
at them.

1414
01:14:33.761 --> 01:14:38.050
But this time.
it would just be me. And you.

1415
01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:45.219
Okay.

1416
01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:49.186
Here. let me get a picture.

1417
01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:55.608
I'm good. Okay.

1418
01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:59.655
And. Smile.

1419
01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:00.662
Emma!

1420
01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:15.800
J when I woke up
I was all alone &

1421
01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:17.919
j of a day-l-ay-l-ay

1422
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:21.422
j with a broken heart
and a ticket home &

1423
01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:22.924
look. Emma and orla.

1424
01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:28.637
Are you sure?

1425
01:15:28.649 --> 01:15:29.889
What are we doing standing here?

1426
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:31.481
Let's go dance. come on.

1427
01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:33.650
Come on. let's dance.

1428
01:16:02.516 --> 01:16:05.007
Now folks. we're very fortunate
here tonight

1429
01:16:05.019 --> 01:16:07.180
to have with us
a lovely American girl

1430
01:16:07.188 --> 01:16:09.270
who's a very fine violin player.

1431
01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:11.980
But I have seen her develop
over the last few months

1432
01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:14.646
into becoming a great Irish
Fiddler.

1433
01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:15.483
Finley. come up here

1434
01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:17.319
and give them something
to dance to.

1435
01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:19.154
Come on. Get up here.

1436
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.036
Let's go for it.

1437
01:16:29.043 --> 01:16:30.203
Two. three. four.

1438
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:40.550
Orla. come on.

1439
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:55.478
What a surprise to see you here
without Taylor.

1440
01:16:55.486 --> 01:16:57.693
Yeah. you know.
I couldn't believe my luck

1441
01:16:57.696 --> 01:16:59.311
when Finley said yes.

1442
01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:01.814
She's pretty talented.
wouldn't you agree?

1443
01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.074
Yeah. Indeed.

1444
01:17:04.078 --> 01:17:07.491
Yeah. you know what.
You'll have to excuse me;

1445
01:17:07.498 --> 01:17:10.205
I'm going to ask this young lady
for a dance.

1446
01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:15.165
May I have this dance?

1447
01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:17.371
Yes. she says yes.

1448
01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:35.856
Come on.

1449
01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:47.447
Thank you. Seamus.

1450
01:17:47.454 --> 01:17:49.866
They can hear your heart now.

1451
01:17:49.874 --> 01:17:52.991
Aww. you better go back
to your fella.

1452
01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:55.243
I can see he's gettin'
a bit lonely.

1453
01:17:56.797 --> 01:17:59.083
- You wanna dance?
- Do you wanna dance?

1454
01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:00.922
Ma'am. can I have this dance?

1455
01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:02.507
Can I have this dance?

1456
01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.637
Wow. now that was
a different girl up there.

1457
01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:17.731
Well. thanks to a certain
Irish tour guide.

1458
01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:20.101
No. no. no. thanks
to an old Irish busker

1459
01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:22.854
who was the best teacher
she could ever ask for.

1460
01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:25.231
So. how is your
Irish prom going?

1461
01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:28.951
Perfect. but there's
one thing I haven't done yet.

1462
01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:29.659
What's that?

1463
01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:32.492
Kiss a beautiful Fiddler
under a starry Irish night.

1464
01:18:32.499 --> 01:18:36.083
Well. too bad.
I played the violin.

1465
01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:37.417
Close enough.

1466
01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:09.779
Uh.

1467
01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:14.329
About four years ago.

1468
01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:18.075
After my brother got back

1469
01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:24.083
he was helping at this refugee
center in the middle east.

1470
01:19:25.844 --> 01:19:31.840
And uh. I guess he was just

1471
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:34.842
at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1472
01:19:41.193 --> 01:19:42.729
I'm so sorry.

1473
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:47.655
Alex had this peace
about him though.

1474
01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:51.150
He was so alive.

1475
01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:55.662
I know it's probably
a stupid idea. but. uh.

1476
01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:59.204
I don't know. I thought
if I could come here

1477
01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:03.295
and see what he saw.

1478
01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.589
I could find what he had.

1479
01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:10.172
Sorry.

1480
01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:14.139
I didn't mean to drop all
of this on the dragon slayer.

1481
01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:16.725
Hey. I'd like to think

1482
01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:19.766
I'm a little bit more
than that by now.

1483
01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.100
Hmmm.

1484
01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:24.016
Yeah. you are.

1485
01:20:42.796 --> 01:20:46.380
Hey. you guys want to know
where Beckett rush is staying?

1486
01:20:46.383 --> 01:20:48.123
Yeah. sure.

1487
01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:53.173
Oh no!

1488
01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:56.390
That's him.
That's him. He's coming.

1489
01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:01.099
Beckett. who is this girl?

1490
01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:11.606
Is that your new girl?

1491
01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:13.657
- What does Taylor think of this?
- Get out of here.

1492
01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:15.776
Are you sure
you wouldn't like some tea?

1493
01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:19.576
With BlackBerry scones.
Or biscuits?

1494
01:21:19.583 --> 01:21:23.292
Very kind of you. but I.
Think I lost my appetite.

1495
01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:25.707
Taylor risdale is in my house.

1496
01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:28.205
Do you think maybe we
should give them some privacy?

1497
01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:30.959
Never! I've got to see this.

1498
01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:38.181
It's ridiculous.

1499
01:21:38.185 --> 01:21:40.585
You'd think they'd have enough
pictures of me already. Right?

1500
01:21:41.605 --> 01:21:43.141
This is a mess!

1501
01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:44.263
What the hell were you thinking?

1502
01:21:44.274 --> 01:21:46.765
What do you mean?
We just went out for a night.

1503
01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:48.313
What is so wrong with that?

1504
01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.027
I'm trying to save his career
before he pisses it away!

1505
01:21:51.031 --> 01:21:53.067
I'm trying to have a life
before you piss that away!

1506
01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:56.533
All right. I think
it's time to go to bed.

1507
01:21:56.537 --> 01:21:57.492
Long day.

1508
01:21:57.496 --> 01:21:59.111
Emma. orla.

1509
01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:03.115
Tea is here. If you want it.

1510
01:22:03.127 --> 01:22:04.492
Good night.

1511
01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:12.124
All right. This is how
I'm going to spin it. okay.

1512
01:22:12.136 --> 01:22:15.048
Beckett rush crashes
a small Irish festival

1513
01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:16.010
or whatever the hell it is.

1514
01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:16.969
You have one too many drinks.

1515
01:22:16.974 --> 01:22:20.011
You make girls' dreams come true
by giving them kisses.

1516
01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:23.010
That'll keep you wild. kind.
and still with Taylor.

1517
01:22:23.021 --> 01:22:25.353
The fans will eat that up.

1518
01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:26.813
How can you do this to him?

1519
01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:27.897
That's not who he is!

1520
01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:29.812
And how long have you known him?

1521
01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:30.559
You need to be quiet.

1522
01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:33.313
and step away from things
you know nothing about.

1523
01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:36.778
Beckett. she doesn't know you
the way that I do.

1524
01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.777
- He's just.
- Finley. that's enough. okay.

1525
01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:42.200
Son. you're the envy
of the world.

1526
01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:43.322
Why wouldn't you want that?

1527
01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.699
He just does this to please you.

1528
01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:46.370
Can't you see that?

1529
01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:48.869
He just wants to have
a normal life.

1530
01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:49.870
Maybe go to college.

1531
01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:52.669
Finley. just. Just stop!

1532
01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:59.387
You know what. maybe
Taylor's right.

1533
01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:02.758
Maybe you're never
gonna understand!

1534
01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:11.316
You're just his puppet.

1535
01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:12.897
You don't even have the balls

1536
01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:16.022
to stand up
for who you really are.

1537
01:23:17.618 --> 01:23:20.781
Hey. don't worry. Okay.

1538
01:23:20.787 --> 01:23:24.200
She just.
Can't understand our life.

1539
01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:27.825
It's for the best.

1540
01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:30.915
Will you guys
just leave me alone right now?

1541
01:23:38.597 --> 01:23:40.258
I'm telling you;
I'm warning yous

1542
01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:42.256
right now. get out of here.

1543
01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:44.053
The lot of ya.

1544
01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:51.602
Thanks so much. Nora.

1545
01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:53.100
Well played. Nora.

1546
01:23:53.904 --> 01:23:56.270
I really wish I didn't
have to leave you guys.

1547
01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:57.566
But you're never
gonna have any peace

1548
01:23:57.574 --> 01:23:59.235
with me staying here. so.

1549
01:23:59.243 --> 01:23:59.902
We'll miss you.

1550
01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:02.276
But you know you can come back
and be my sous-chef anytime.

1551
01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:05.029
Oh. Sean. I got you something.

1552
01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:11.960
No more burnt hands. huh!

1553
01:24:11.964 --> 01:24:13.875
I love them.

1554
01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:16.715
Thanks. buddy.

1555
01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:18.921
- Nora!
- Oh. sweetheart!

1556
01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:21.803
I'm gonna miss you guys.

1557
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:45.952
Beckett. let's take a walk.

1558
01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:47.537
I'm sorry. I'm working.

1559
01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:50.999
I don't care. Come with me. Now.

1560
01:24:57.050 --> 01:25:00.542
Ciara. shenae. Logan.
everyone down there.

1561
01:25:00.554 --> 01:25:04.172
everyone in post
and marketing in la.

1562
01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:05.137
All these people
are your friends

1563
01:25:05.142 --> 01:25:08.009
who work on the movie.
they're here because of you.

1564
01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.476
They depend on you.

1565
01:25:09.479 --> 01:25:10.514
Your movies sell.

1566
01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:12.228
which provides
for their families.

1567
01:25:12.232 --> 01:25:15.190
If you're not gonna do this
for you or for me.

1568
01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:17.104
at least do it for them.

1569
01:25:19.823 --> 01:25:21.188
And Taylor.

1570
01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:24.028
You've grown up together.
You've been through a lot.

1571
01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:26.527
She's the only person
on this planet

1572
01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:29.905
who truly understands
what you've been through.

1573
01:25:32.753 --> 01:25:36.371
It's just not like you
to betray people.

1574
01:26:26.264 --> 01:26:27.879
I'm so sorry.

1575
01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:30.098
It's fine. It's fine.

1576
01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:30.966
It's fine.

1577
01:26:30.977 --> 01:26:32.808
It doesn't matter.

1578
01:26:32.813 --> 01:26:34.303
It's fine.

1579
01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:48.650
Hello!

1580
01:26:48.662 --> 01:26:50.778
Finley. it's me. Seamus.

1581
01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:51.448
Oh. hey. what's up?

1582
01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:53.287
Can you come down to the pub

1583
01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:54.747
as soon as you can. please?

1584
01:26:54.751 --> 01:26:58.039
Uh. Yeah. sure.

1585
01:27:01.174 --> 01:27:01.913
Hey guys.

1586
01:27:01.925 --> 01:27:03.961
Ah. there you are. Finley.

1587
01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:13.725
Give him a chance.

1588
01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:16.310
Thank you. Seamus.

1589
01:27:18.984 --> 01:27:20.224
Hey!

1590
01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:22.559
Sorry about all that.

1591
01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:25.483
I just didn't think
you'd come if I called.

1592
01:27:27.492 --> 01:27:29.153
I've been thinking about you.

1593
01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:32.570
Your audition's next week.

1594
01:27:34.207 --> 01:27:35.697
Yeah.

1595
01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:37.866
Look. uh.

1596
01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:41.579
I'm sorry about the other night.

1597
01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:43.584
I screwed up.

1598
01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:46.170
Please. just give me
a little bit more time.

1599
01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:48.214
and I'll figure all this out.

1600
01:27:51.391 --> 01:27:54.758
If you wanna live
this double life.

1601
01:27:56.521 --> 01:27:59.012
I can't be a part of either one.

1602
01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:02.687
Look. it's harder
than it looks. okay.

1603
01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:06.236
I'm just trying to protect you.

1604
01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:08.317
I don't want you to
expose yourself to the media.

1605
01:28:08.325 --> 01:28:10.441
have your name dragged
through the mud like that?

1606
01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:11.612
Do you want that?

1607
01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:12.655
Yes.

1608
01:28:12.662 --> 01:28:17.702
If that's what
it takes to be real.

1609
01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:22.711
It's not just about me. okay!

1610
01:28:23.048 --> 01:28:24.584
I have a lot of people
depending on me.

1611
01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:26.923
and I don't wanna let them down.

1612
01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:30.794
Yeah. um.

1613
01:28:31.932 --> 01:28:35.220
You know. Taylor was right.

1614
01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:36.387
No.

1615
01:28:36.394 --> 01:28:38.009
I don't know
what I was thinking.

1616
01:28:38.021 --> 01:28:40.933
That this could work.

1617
01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:45.184
But-but we can. okay.

1618
01:28:45.195 --> 01:28:46.605
We can.

1619
01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.236
You just gotta trust me.

1620
01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:52.448
I tried.

1621
01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:03.042
Ah!

1622
01:29:06.424 --> 01:29:07.960
I mean. you're
probably the first girl

1623
01:29:07.968 --> 01:29:10.755
to ever break up
with Beckett rush.

1624
01:29:13.473 --> 01:29:16.840
So why am I crying so much?

1625
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:37.535
You see. Finley.

1626
01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:39.996
life rarely works out
the way we plan it.

1627
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.538
You've got to learn to play
the sorrow as well as the joy.

1628
01:29:43.545 --> 01:29:46.628
They are linked.
like day and night.

1629
01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:49.873
You can't have one
without the other.

1630
01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:51.341
Give it a go.

1631
01:30:06.651 --> 01:30:08.937
Very good. Good.

1632
01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:15.031
Beautiful.

1633
01:30:45.815 --> 01:30:51.185
Beckett's told me
you broke it off.

1634
01:30:51.196 --> 01:30:53.187
Are you suffering?

1635
01:30:54.199 --> 01:30:56.485
- You saw him?
- Hm-mm.

1636
01:31:00.205 --> 01:31:02.036
Make love. not war.

1637
01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.247
Love. Beckett.

1638
01:31:06.836 --> 01:31:09.543
Yeah.

1639
01:31:10.382 --> 01:31:13.624
My little troubles seem petty
compared to yours.

1640
01:31:13.635 --> 01:31:16.547
I asked you. I want to know.

1641
01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:19.170
He's a good boy.

1642
01:31:19.182 --> 01:31:22.891
Yeah.

1643
01:31:22.894 --> 01:31:25.852
It's hard to change.

1644
01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.021
Mrs. sweeney.

1645
01:31:35.073 --> 01:31:36.062
What really happened

1646
01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:39.066
between you and your sister
all those years ago?

1647
01:31:39.077 --> 01:31:41.284
I took my sister's fella.

1648
01:31:41.287 --> 01:31:43.528
No. don't give me that.

1649
01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:45.246
There has to be more to it.

1650
01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:48.287
People would tell ya otherwise.

1651
01:31:49.629 --> 01:31:51.039
â€œWell.

1652
01:31:52.132 --> 01:31:56.466
Being here in Ireland
has taught me to look deeper.

1653
01:31:58.471 --> 01:32:01.178
Things aren't always
as they seem.

1654
01:32:11.276 --> 01:32:12.937
My father was a gambler.

1655
01:32:12.944 --> 01:32:20.862
He'd bet on anything.
Horses. politics. the weather.

1656
01:32:21.327 --> 01:32:25.946
Eventually. we were
about to lose our house.

1657
01:32:25.957 --> 01:32:28.369
It would've killed my mother.

1658
01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:33.791
She. It had been in her family
for generations.

1659
01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:38.963
So. my father made a deal
with Mr. sweeney.

1660
01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:42.007
Which had a very high price.

1661
01:32:44.017 --> 01:32:46.508
Our family name
meant something then.

1662
01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:51.138
Charles sweeney had money.
but he had no social standing.

1663
01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:55.188
My little sister
didn't have many suitors.

1664
01:32:55.195 --> 01:33:00.406
So. How did you end up
with Charles sweeney?

1665
01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:03.525
When Charles sweeney drank.

1666
01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:06.786
he got angry. He was violent.

1667
01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:11.325
I had an eye for these things.

1668
01:33:11.336 --> 01:33:13.827
He was clever.

1669
01:33:13.838 --> 01:33:14.748
Huh.

1670
01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:19.045
He left bruises
where you couldn't see.

1671
01:33:21.554 --> 01:33:24.546
So. You took her place?

1672
01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:27.181
You were protecting her.
and she never knew.

1673
01:33:27.185 --> 01:33:31.929
She thought
I took him for the money.

1674
01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:36.855
My sister was blinded
with young love.

1675
01:33:36.861 --> 01:33:39.648
How did Charles sweeney die?

1676
01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:44.407
People said I killed him.

1677
01:33:46.788 --> 01:33:48.324
Did you?

1678
01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:52.957
If wishes were bullets.

1679
01:34:04.055 --> 01:34:06.592
Why didn't you just start over?

1680
01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:09.132
When no one wants to hear.

1681
01:34:09.144 --> 01:34:11.510
it's better to hide.

1682
01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.937
Hide and be angry.

1683
01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:22.230
Well. didn't I wear my anger
like a grand fur coat!

1684
01:34:22.824 --> 01:34:25.110
It all was for nothing.

1685
01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:30.324
Wasted years!

1686
01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:32.322
In the end. it's a choice.

1687
01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:35.575
and I made the wrong one.

1688
01:35:24.594 --> 01:35:25.299
Hey.

1689
01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:27.635
Hey. I need a favor.

1690
01:35:28.056 --> 01:35:29.637
So. you called me first?

1691
01:35:29.641 --> 01:35:32.883
No. uh. I tried everyone else.

1692
01:35:32.894 --> 01:35:34.100
Last resort.

1693
01:35:34.103 --> 01:35:35.559
Okay. uh. what's up?

1694
01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:37.679
Mrs. sweeney
told me the whole story.

1695
01:35:37.732 --> 01:35:39.472
I have to get to Fiona's.

1696
01:35:39.484 --> 01:35:40.690
Where are.?

1697
01:35:40.693 --> 01:35:43.480
Did you try riding up there
in this rain?

1698
01:35:43.488 --> 01:35:46.400
Maybe. Perfect day
for a convertible.

1699
01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:49.820
All right. I'll be there.

1700
01:36:04.884 --> 01:36:08.718
Hey. uh.
we really need to talk to you.

1701
01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:09.881
It's important.

1702
01:36:09.889 --> 01:36:11.174
I have nothing to say to you.

1703
01:36:11.182 --> 01:36:13.343
She's just trying to help. okay.

1704
01:36:13.351 --> 01:36:15.763
Please. hear her out.

1705
01:36:25.029 --> 01:36:25.643
Thank you.

1706
01:36:25.655 --> 01:36:27.361
We just. Wanted to let you know

1707
01:36:27.365 --> 01:36:32.450
that cathleen isn't expected
to live much longer.

1708
01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:38.205
We've talked about
the past some. Her regrets.

1709
01:36:38.334 --> 01:36:42.293
How could you steal a man away
from your own sister?

1710
01:36:42.297 --> 01:36:46.586
She tried to explain herself.
In the letters.

1711
01:36:47.719 --> 01:36:49.755
Did you ever even read them?

1712
01:36:49.804 --> 01:36:50.338
Why would 17?

1713
01:36:50.346 --> 01:36:55.807
Miss Doyle. your sister
married Charles to protect you.

1714
01:36:58.479 --> 01:37:01.437
He was physically abusive.

1715
01:37:02.775 --> 01:37:05.187
How am I supposed
to believe all this?

1716
01:37:05.194 --> 01:37:08.652
Cathleen begged your father
to drop the arrangement.

1717
01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:09.520
But he was in too much debt.

1718
01:37:09.532 --> 01:37:14.492
and Charles was.
Too dangerous to cross.

1719
01:37:15.747 --> 01:37:17.954
It was so humiliating.

1720
01:37:17.957 --> 01:37:20.323
I'm really sorry about that.

1721
01:37:21.878 --> 01:37:25.712
But your sister
has been shunned for decades

1722
01:37:25.715 --> 01:37:27.330
for trying to help you.

1723
01:37:27.342 --> 01:37:29.253
and you won't even open

1724
01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:31.626
the letters that she... - Finley.

1725
01:37:35.767 --> 01:37:39.931
Look. miss Doyle.
Your sister's dying wish

1726
01:37:39.937 --> 01:37:42.895
is that she would
have your forgiveness.

1727
01:37:44.233 --> 01:37:45.894
Please. just.

1728
01:37:46.944 --> 01:37:50.732
Come and see her.

1729
01:37:54.786 --> 01:37:57.869
I think you two
should be on your way now.

1730
01:38:14.889 --> 01:38:16.595
- Hey!
- Hey.

1731
01:38:16.599 --> 01:38:18.055
Come in.

1732
01:38:18.976 --> 01:38:20.341
What's up? -

1733
01:38:20.353 --> 01:38:22.139
nothing. How are ya?

1734
01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:24.387
Pretty tired.

1735
01:38:24.399 --> 01:38:26.310
Yeah.

1736
01:38:26.317 --> 01:38:28.478
So. um.

1737
01:38:29.153 --> 01:38:32.941
Are you seriously thinking about
not signing that contract?

1738
01:38:34.617 --> 01:38:35.857
Uh.

1739
01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.826
I don't know yet.

1740
01:38:43.835 --> 01:38:45.291
Beck.

1741
01:38:47.672 --> 01:38:53.292
Look. we. uh.
We're in this together.

1742
01:38:54.804 --> 01:38:59.798
You and me. we're. We're linked.

1743
01:38:59.809 --> 01:39:01.640
Always have been.

1744
01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:09.478
What you do impacts me.

1745
01:39:11.904 --> 01:39:14.316
Please don't do this.

1746
01:39:15.158 --> 01:39:18.025
After everything
we've been through.

1747
01:39:22.290 --> 01:39:23.996
We need this. Yeah.

1748
01:39:31.299 --> 01:39:33.335
So. what are we supposed to do?

1749
01:39:34.093 --> 01:39:37.881
Just. Sacrifice our whole lives?

1750
01:39:39.015 --> 01:39:41.631
I don't know. It doesn't
make any sense to me.

1751
01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:50.641
So few. Understand this.
Life that we lead.

1752
01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:58.610
Does she really know you
the way I do?

1753
01:40:02.788 --> 01:40:04.449
Think about it.

1754
01:40:06.584 --> 01:40:11.954
I. Will be in my room.

1755
01:40:11.964 --> 01:40:14.671
If you wanna. Talk.

1756
01:40:18.763 --> 01:40:20.094
Hey. tay.

1757
01:40:20.890 --> 01:40:21.925
Yeah?

1758
01:40:21.933 --> 01:40:23.514
Um.

1759
01:40:24.101 --> 01:40:26.513
- Huh?
- Ah.

1760
01:40:26.521 --> 01:40:28.386
Would you ride your bike
in the pouring rain

1761
01:40:28.397 --> 01:40:30.388
just to help an old lady?

1762
01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:33.599
Of course.

1763
01:40:34.946 --> 01:40:36.982
But I wouldn't need to.

1764
01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:40.277
Just. Hire a driver.

1765
01:40:58.094 --> 01:41:00.927
I leave for New York tomorrow.

1766
01:41:00.930 --> 01:41:01.419
Hmmm.

1767
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:05.014
It's crazy to think
that this one audition

1768
01:41:05.059 --> 01:41:08.267
is gonna decide
the direction of my life.

1769
01:41:10.356 --> 01:41:11.641
Yeah.

1770
01:41:13.442 --> 01:41:16.058
If you'd got in the first time.

1771
01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:19.312
You wouldn't be bugging me now.

1772
01:41:19.323 --> 01:41:23.407
Yeah. I guess that's true.

1773
01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:25.743
I'm glad you botched it.

1774
01:41:34.672 --> 01:41:38.506
That I couldn't get
your sister to come.

1775
01:41:38.509 --> 01:41:41.546
I-I really trieq.
I did everything that I could.

1776
01:41:41.554 --> 01:41:44.341
but she just.
she wouldn't listen.

1777
01:41:44.348 --> 01:41:46.009
I trust you did.

1778
01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.886
With everything that you did

1779
01:41:51.897 --> 01:41:53.433
for your father and your sister.

1780
01:41:53.441 --> 01:41:55.853
you are the bravest person
I've ever met.

1781
01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.522
You obviously
haven't met many people.

1782
01:41:58.529 --> 01:41:59.689
Just shut up.

1783
01:42:03.701 --> 01:42:07.285
You wouldn't have said that
a few months ago.

1784
01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.496
Yeah. um.

1785
01:42:10.499 --> 01:42:14.242
I guess Ireland
is just full of surprises.

1786
01:42:14.253 --> 01:42:15.538
Fact.

1787
01:42:17.048 --> 01:42:18.629
Bye. sweetheart.

1788
01:42:18.633 --> 01:42:20.919
Wind in your sails.

1789
01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:43.236
Can I have a word?

1790
01:42:53.793 --> 01:42:56.205
I'm not signing that contract.

1791
01:43:00.758 --> 01:43:02.419
Here's the deal.

1792
01:43:03.803 --> 01:43:08.263
I'll do one more film.
In the next six months.

1793
01:43:08.474 --> 01:43:11.432
And I don't care
how much money I make.

1794
01:43:11.644 --> 01:43:15.102
I'm not doing this for me.
Or for you.

1795
01:43:15.106 --> 01:43:16.141
I'm doing this
for the cast and crew

1796
01:43:16.148 --> 01:43:19.891
so they can prepare for life
after Steele markov.

1797
01:43:20.653 --> 01:43:24.396
That's my offer.
Take it or leave it.

1798
01:43:27.827 --> 01:43:29.567
As your manager.

1799
01:43:30.287 --> 01:43:32.118
I have to warn you that this is.

1800
01:43:32.123 --> 01:43:35.456
The most asinine thing
you've ever done.

1801
01:43:39.588 --> 01:43:42.580
I don't need
a manager right now.

1802
01:43:42.591 --> 01:43:44.252
I need a father.

1803
01:44:22.006 --> 01:44:25.624
So. You think it's good enough?

1804
01:44:25.843 --> 01:44:29.256
You are ready for your audition.

1805
01:44:30.848 --> 01:44:34.056
Thank you. Seamus.
for everything.

1806
01:44:34.059 --> 01:44:37.677
Now go and make them
stuck up music professors

1807
01:44:37.688 --> 01:44:40.555
tap their feet.

1808
01:44:40.566 --> 01:44:41.851
I will.

1809
01:44:58.793 --> 01:44:59.873
That's okay. I'll get it.

1810
01:44:59.877 --> 01:45:01.458
Emma. you take that.

1811
01:45:01.754 --> 01:45:03.540
Here's some soda bread
to bring to your mom.

1812
01:45:03.547 --> 01:45:06.380
We would have made more.
but we've been so busy.

1813
01:45:06.383 --> 01:45:07.372
Nonstop calls from people

1814
01:45:07.384 --> 01:45:09.841
wantin' to stay
in Beckett's room.

1815
01:45:09.845 --> 01:45:11.255
Imagine that.

1816
01:45:21.732 --> 01:45:23.393
Hello!

1817
01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:24.936
Oh. hey. What's up?

1818
01:45:31.408 --> 01:45:33.490
Did her sister ever come?

1819
01:45:34.912 --> 01:45:36.197
So she's all alone?

1820
01:46:07.152 --> 01:46:08.938
I have to go back.

1821
01:46:09.613 --> 01:46:11.444
Did you forget something?

1822
01:46:12.074 --> 01:46:13.484
What's wrong?

1823
01:46:14.952 --> 01:46:17.113
I need to be somewhere else.

1824
01:46:20.291 --> 01:46:21.906
Are you sure. Finley?

1825
01:46:26.338 --> 01:46:28.124
Yeah.

1826
01:46:55.743 --> 01:46:57.358
Am I too late?

1827
01:46:57.786 --> 01:47:01.119
No. You're just in time.

1828
01:47:03.167 --> 01:47:07.627
Cathleen. your sister's here.

1829
01:47:14.178 --> 01:47:16.294
Cath.

1830
01:47:18.265 --> 01:47:19.721
Fi.-

1831
01:47:19.725 --> 01:47:23.434
oh my god. Fiona.

1832
01:47:29.068 --> 01:47:30.979
We're old.

1833
01:47:33.781 --> 01:47:35.112
Yeah.

1834
01:47:37.117 --> 01:47:39.324
Where's-?

1835
01:47:40.037 --> 01:47:44.827
Finley. Come and sit with us.

1836
01:47:58.138 --> 01:47:59.594
Fi.

1837
01:48:03.686 --> 01:48:05.267
We're okay now.

1838
01:49:07.332 --> 01:49:08.663
Oh. my!

1839
01:51:12.249 --> 01:51:15.412
So. you're back in town.

1840
01:51:16.044 --> 01:51:18.581
Still driving this
ridiculous convertible. I see.

1841
01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:21.046
Yeah. I'm all ready
for the next sunny day.

1842
01:51:21.049 --> 01:51:23.506
In two months.

1843
01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:29.513
1. uh. I went to that cemetery.

1844
01:51:31.101 --> 01:51:32.466
I told you I'd find it.

1845
01:51:32.477 --> 01:51:34.013
Thank you. Beckett.

1846
01:51:34.021 --> 01:51:34.851
Sorry it took me so long.

1847
01:51:34.855 --> 01:51:37.597
I had to search every one
within a hundred miles of here.

1848
01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:39.765
I guess I was wrong.

1849
01:51:39.776 --> 01:51:41.687
Maybe I can trust you.

1850
01:51:42.112 --> 01:51:42.976
Well. you still look gorgeous

1851
01:51:42.988 --> 01:51:44.944
when you admit
that you're wrong.

1852
01:51:47.784 --> 01:51:48.569
So. what did you find?

1853
01:51:48.577 --> 01:51:54.072
Well. four years ago.
my brother drew this picture

1854
01:51:54.082 --> 01:51:57.540
for this moment
when I needed it most.

1855
01:51:57.878 --> 01:52:02.793
I couldn't see it then. but.
I was never alone.

1856
01:52:04.551 --> 01:52:07.634
Well. sometimes things
aren't always as they seem.

1857
01:52:10.557 --> 01:52:16.268
So. I didn't sign the contract.

1858
01:52:16.271 --> 01:52:16.805
What?

1859
01:52:16.813 --> 01:52:18.849
I'm going to do one more movie
just to help everybody out.

1860
01:52:18.857 --> 01:52:22.395
but then. Next fall.
I'm going to college.

1861
01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:25.360
Well. girls' hearts
will be shattered

1862
01:52:25.364 --> 01:52:26.103
all over the world.

1863
01:52:26.114 --> 01:52:30.232
Well. there's only one girl's
heart that I care about.

1864
01:52:31.495 --> 01:52:33.235
No more double-life either.

1865
01:52:33.247 --> 01:52:35.829
Tomorrow. a story's
going to hit social media.

1866
01:52:35.832 --> 01:52:39.825
telling the world
that Taylor and I are done.

1867
01:52:39.836 --> 01:52:41.326
Finally!

1868
01:52:42.172 --> 01:52:43.912
I'm happy about it.

1869
01:52:44.675 --> 01:52:48.259
Because there's a fair warrior
I wanna try and win back.

1870
01:53:02.025 --> 01:53:03.356
Finished the last few weeks

1871
01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.523
of my exchange program
and went home.

1872
01:53:07.531 --> 01:53:09.146
I told the conservatory
about Mrs. sweeney.

1873
01:53:09.157 --> 01:53:13.150
and they allowed me to
audition after the deadline.

1874
01:53:13.161 --> 01:53:14.196
one final time.

1875
01:53:52.451 --> 01:53:53.657
I was accepted.

1876
01:53:57.748 --> 01:53:58.453
Beckett visited.

1877
01:53:58.457 --> 01:54:01.324
And of course. we crashed
my old high school's prom.

1878
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:11.257
That summer.
I went back to Ireland.

1879
01:54:12.804 --> 01:54:14.419
.And helped Beckett
with his lines

1880
01:54:14.431 --> 01:54:16.296
on his last dragon film.

1881
01:54:19.311 --> 01:54:21.142
Beckett began college
in New York.

1882
01:54:21.146 --> 01:54:22.431
He's trying to be a normal guy.

1883
01:54:22.439 --> 01:54:24.771
but he still needs
his disguises.

1884
01:54:27.652 --> 01:54:29.313
And. in Autumn.
at the conservatory.

1885
01:54:29.321 --> 01:54:34.486
I played the violin.
Or fiddle. as Seamus would say.
