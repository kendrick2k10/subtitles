[intense music]

10
00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:19.166
- [Charlie] I don't think
you seem to grasp the concept

11
00:01:19.296 --> 00:01:20.515
of what I am saying.

12
00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:23.518
I don't care what the
collateral damage is.

13
00:01:23.648 --> 00:01:25.781
This is a monumental
day for me so I want you

14
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:27.043
to stop complaining and get on

15
00:01:27.174 --> 00:01:29.176
with the fucking job
I'm paying you for!

[intense percussive music]

17
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:55.202
This is really inconvenient.

18
00:01:56.203 --> 00:01:57.595
I'm taking a product

19
00:01:57.726 --> 00:01:59.641
to market and have a press
conference in 20 minutes.

20
00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:01.773
- [Jordan] Well
let's get it done.

21
00:02:01.904 --> 00:02:05.037
[Charlie sighing]

22
00:02:05.168 --> 00:02:05.995

Charlie.

24
00:02:09.738 --> 00:02:10.826
Bit dramatic.

25
00:02:16.832 --> 00:02:18.834
Has he said anything useful?

26
00:02:18.964 --> 00:02:22.185
- The usual. begging
for his life and shit.

27
00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:27.016
- Please Mr Knight.
I swear to god.

28
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.105
I had no idea what
Tom was doing!

29
00:02:29.714 --> 00:02:31.107
I mean. how would I?

30
00:02:31.238 --> 00:02:32.935
I'm a scientist!

31
00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:35.503
I've been working on
this for six years!

32
00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:38.070
And I've never leaked
any information.

33
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:41.161
I'm loyal to you.
I always have been!

34
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:42.553
Shhhh. Robert.

35
00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:44.251
It's okay. I know.

36
00:02:45.252 --> 00:02:46.122
Sir.

37
00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:47.210
We good?

38
00:02:48.255 --> 00:02:49.256
It's started.

00:02:55.262 --> 00:02:58.743
[Robert breathing heavily]

40
00:03:00.658 --> 00:03:01.442
Robert.

41
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:07.274
your work on this drug
is groundbreaking.

42
00:03:08.797 --> 00:03:11.756
The last six years
haven't been in vain.

43
00:03:13.802 --> 00:03:18.154
You will make millions
of families happy.

44
00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:20.200
What about my family?

45
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.376
I've got two little kids.

46
00:03:23.377 --> 00:03:26.206
Please. I really want
to see them again.

47
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.688
Each great idea has a face.

48
00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:33.778
And this. isn't it.

49
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.218
- Don't do this.
please Charlie. please!

50
00:03:38.348 --> 00:03:40.394
I swear on my kids lives.

51
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:44.006
I didn't know what
Tom was doing.

52
00:03:44.136 --> 00:03:45.355
And I believe you.

53
00:03:49.403 --> 00:03:50.882
But just to be sure.

00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:55.583

Fuck sake!

58
00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:59.891
How many more times!

59
00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:01.066
Wait till I've left the room.

60
00:04:01.197 --> 00:04:03.852
you'll burst my
fucking ear drums!

61
00:04:03.982 --> 00:04:05.723
Christ. I've got a press
conference with ringing

62
00:04:05.854 --> 00:04:07.029
in my fucking ears.

63
00:04:08.422 --> 00:04:09.553
- [Reporter] This
is certainly a fifth

64
00:04:09.684 --> 00:04:11.207
of November to remember

65
00:04:11.338 --> 00:04:14.297
after today's shocking
attack in Battersea.

66
00:04:14.428 --> 00:04:17.082
Witnesses reported gun
shots and smoke coming

67
00:04:17.213 --> 00:04:18.606
from within the building.

68
00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:21.391
Police have confirmed this
was a targeted incident.

69
00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:23.480
however it is unknown
whether it is linked

70
00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:25.395
to the recent spate
of Arson attacks

71
00:04:25.526 --> 00:04:28.137
on medical research
facilities across the UK.

[gentle orchestral music]

74
00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.407
Hi.

75
00:04:37.538 --> 00:04:38.843
You must be Mr.
and Mrs. Thompson?

76
00:04:38.974 --> 00:04:40.410
So sorry we're late.

77
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:42.107
- Yeah. there was a
delay on the tubes.

78
00:04:42.238 --> 00:04:44.284
I'm not sure what was happening.

79
00:04:44.414 --> 00:04:45.415
No worries at all.

80
00:04:45.546 --> 00:04:46.721
I'm Matilda Watson.

81
00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:48.288
I'll be showing you round today.

82
00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:49.637
Uh. shall we?

83
00:04:50.725 --> 00:04:53.989
If I can ever find
the right key that is.

84
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.731
It's alright. no rush.

85
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:59.429
- Er. so have you
guys come far today?

86
00:05:01.431 --> 00:05:02.867
- I mean-
- Ha.

87
00:05:02.998 --> 00:05:03.999
Here we go.

88
00:05:07.437 --> 00:05:09.961
So. this is the main hallway.

89
00:05:10.092 --> 00:05:11.311
Ah. smells a bit.

90
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:12.921
It has been empty a while.

91
00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:15.489
As you can see though. it's
spacious and it gets plenty

92
00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:16.403
of natural light.

93
00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:18.187
Oh. that's a good thing.

94
00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.798
- [Matilda] Why don't we take
a look at the living room.

95
00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:24.411
- Oh. big fan of
the high ceilings.

96
00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:26.282
- Me too. it's one
of the great things

97
00:05:26.413 --> 00:05:27.936
about a period
property like this.

98
00:05:28.066 --> 00:05:30.286
You've also got the
lovely bay window here.

99
00:05:31.418 --> 00:05:32.549
Ah. nice.

100
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.464
- [Matilda] So. what
do we think so far?

101
00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:35.422
Yeah.

102
00:05:35.552 --> 00:05:37.815
So far. so good.

103
00:05:37.946 --> 00:05:40.340
- Next room?
- Sure. okay.

104
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.950
So this is the dining room.

105
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.344
again its a really
good sized space.

106
00:05:44.474 --> 00:05:46.302
You've got the back
doors there that open out

107
00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:47.347
on to the garden area.

108
00:05:47.477 --> 00:05:49.087
Is it side access?

109
00:05:49.218 --> 00:05:50.480
Yes.

110
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:52.352
Gated. this house offers
up a lot of privacy.

111
00:05:52.482 --> 00:05:53.396
Been looking long?

112
00:05:53.527 --> 00:05:55.355
- Ahh. about-
- 13 months.

113
00:05:56.312 --> 00:05:57.357
That is a long time.

114
00:05:57.487 --> 00:05:58.358
Yeah. it's too long.

115
00:05:58.488 --> 00:05:59.837
We're very particular.

116
00:05:59.968 --> 00:06:02.057
- I've got a good
feeling about this house.

117
00:06:02.187 --> 00:06:03.711
Mmm.

118
00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:04.364
- Well. hopefully this is
the end of your search then.

119
00:06:04.494 --> 00:06:05.800
Fingers crossed.

120
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.454
Ah. that being said. I'm
going to have to ask you

121
00:06:07.584 --> 00:06:09.673
to keep an open mind
with this next room.

122
00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.375
[gentle orchestral
music continues]

123
00:06:16.506 --> 00:06:17.333
Wow.

124
00:06:18.203 --> 00:06:20.858
- I take it this is
why it hasn't sold?

125
00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:25.515
[soft music]

126
00:06:36.091 --> 00:06:36.918
What happened?

127
00:06:38.485 --> 00:06:41.139
- I'm aware it doesn't
look like much right now.

128
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.750
- but. actually-
- What happened?

129
00:06:44.752 --> 00:06:47.276
- Clearly. there has been
an accident in this room.

130
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.409
and we've only been able
to get the decorators in.

131
00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:50.975
in the last couple weeks.

132
00:06:51.106 --> 00:06:52.586
They actually started
in the dining room.

133
00:06:52.716 --> 00:06:54.457
then they're going to be
making their way in here.

134
00:06:54.588 --> 00:06:57.199
But I can guarantee you. by
the time you guys move in.

135
00:06:57.329 --> 00:06:59.419
it's going to be as good as new.

136
00:06:59.549 --> 00:07:01.072
Please tell me no one died?

137
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.902
- Yeah. that's not really the
vibe that we're going for.

138
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.037
- Listen. you seem
like a lovely couple.

139
00:07:09.167 --> 00:07:10.865
so let me level with you.

140
00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:13.476
Full disclosure. I actually
don't know all the details.

141
00:07:13.607 --> 00:07:15.347
I've only started
working for the agency

142
00:07:15.478 --> 00:07:16.784
just over a week and a half ago.

143
00:07:16.914 --> 00:07:20.048
but from what I
understand unfortunately

144
00:07:20.178 --> 00:07:22.485
the owner did lose
his life in a fire.

145
00:07:22.616 --> 00:07:24.487
I know. I know. that's
going to be off-putting

146
00:07:24.618 --> 00:07:25.967
to some potential buyers.

147
00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:28.273
but that is reflected
in the price.

148
00:07:28.404 --> 00:07:29.884
Truth be told. a
substantial proportion

149
00:07:30.014 --> 00:07:33.583
of house sales happen every
year due to unexpected deaths.

150
00:07:35.585 --> 00:07:37.587
Go and have a little
look through there.

151
00:07:38.588 --> 00:07:41.286
[gentle orchestral music]

152
00:07:41.417 --> 00:07:44.202
So. in my opinion this is the
real treasure of this house.

153
00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:45.987
A 90-foot garden.

154
00:07:47.205 --> 00:07:48.468
This is 90 foot?

155
00:07:48.598 --> 00:07:50.470
- Yeah. your own
sprawling estate.

156
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.254
- Bet you're going
to get a great view

157
00:07:52.384 --> 00:07:53.995
of the fireworks tonight.

158
00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:55.213
Oh yeah.

159
00:07:55.344 --> 00:07:56.998
Totally forgot it
was Bonfire Night.

160
00:07:57.128 --> 00:07:59.479
It's all lit up by these
solar powered fairy lights.

161
00:07:59.609 --> 00:08:01.524
which it's a nice touch I think.

162
00:08:01.655 --> 00:08:03.526
- I have always wanted
solar powered fairy lights.

163
00:08:03.657 --> 00:08:04.484
Stop it.

164
00:08:04.614 --> 00:08:05.397
What?

165
00:08:05.528 --> 00:08:06.616
Are you keen gardeners?

166
00:08:07.617 --> 00:08:09.010
We can be.

167
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.621
- Personally. I would kill
for a garden this size.

168
00:08:11.752 --> 00:08:12.970
Can we see the upstairs?

169
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:14.232
Yeah. of course.

170
00:08:14.363 --> 00:08:15.669
I mean you're my
last tour of the day.

171
00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:17.497
so there's no rush if
you wanna have a little-

172
00:08:17.627 --> 00:08:19.237
- Sorry.
[phone buzzing]

173
00:08:19.368 --> 00:08:20.587
Oh. it's work.

174
00:08:20.717 --> 00:08:22.850
I've got to take this.
I'll see you up there.

175
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.199
[Both] Okay.

176
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.507
So. this is the main bedroom.

177
00:08:27.637 --> 00:08:28.769
It's a bit dark.

178
00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:29.726
Oh yeah. sorry about that.

179
00:08:29.857 --> 00:08:32.207
I forgot to draw the blinds.

180
00:08:32.337 --> 00:08:33.861
I don't know if
you're into flowers.

181
00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:35.558
but personally I quite
like the attention

182
00:08:35.689 --> 00:08:38.561
to detail with these
little wall paintings.

183
00:08:38.692 --> 00:08:40.520
As you can see though. I
mean there's just so much

184
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.130
you can play with in here.

185
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.175
The previous owner actually
had a little reading nook

186
00:08:44.306 --> 00:08:45.655
in the corner of the um...

187
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.964
[tense music]

188
00:08:52.662 --> 00:08:53.663
Mr. Thompson?

189
00:08:55.404 --> 00:08:56.361
Are you okay?

190
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.017
I'm fine.

191
00:09:02.237 --> 00:09:03.586
You're bleeding.

192
00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:08.286
It's nothing.

193
00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:11.246
- No. I'll get-

194
00:09:11.376 --> 00:09:13.553
[tense music]

195
00:09:15.163 --> 00:09:16.599
[fist thudding]

196
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.384
- You promised you wouldn't
be brash this time.

197
00:09:19.515 --> 00:09:21.212
- She looked like she
was going to scream.

198
00:09:21.343 --> 00:09:22.213
It was efficient.

199
00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:24.825
- Yeah. but not
very imaginative.

200
00:09:28.742 --> 00:09:32.963
- I'm going to need you
To put on your vest this time. just in case.

201
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:34.530
In case of what?

202
00:09:34.661 --> 00:09:35.531
Ha.

203
00:09:35.662 --> 00:09:37.533
Fat lot of good it did you.

204
00:09:37.664 --> 00:09:40.231
- Yeah. well. all my vital
organs are still in tact.

205
00:09:40.362 --> 00:09:41.189
So...

206
00:09:44.714 --> 00:09:46.020
Oh. shit.

207
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.239
I am going to need you
to help me patch this up.

208
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.459
- You know you were lucky
there's an exit wound.

209
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.896
- Oh yeah. I was.
I was just thinking

210
00:09:53.027 --> 00:09:54.332
about how lucky this was.

211
00:09:56.117 --> 00:09:57.074
It's almost dark.

212
00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:03.733
- That's when the
real fun begins.

213
00:10:04.734 --> 00:10:07.737
[fireworks popping]

214
00:10:18.748 --> 00:10:21.272
[tense music]

215
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.106
- A manhunt is currently
underway in the Battersea area

216
00:10:29.237 --> 00:10:33.371
as police search for two
unidentified armed assailants.

217
00:10:33.502 --> 00:10:34.721
who reportedly fled the scene

218
00:10:34.851 --> 00:10:37.549
after the building
went up in flames.

219
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.508
One man was pronounced
dead at the scene

220
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.380
and another remains
in critical condition.

221
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:44.905
As firefighters continue
to battle the blaze.

222
00:10:45.035 --> 00:10:46.646
police are advising people

223
00:10:46.776 --> 00:10:49.997
in the area to be both
cautious and vigilant.

224
00:10:50.127 --> 00:10:53.435
London is literally
burning on bonfire night.

225
00:10:54.784 --> 00:10:55.785
That was you?

226
00:10:57.526 --> 00:10:58.962
You killed someone?

227
00:10:59.093 --> 00:11:00.050
Allegedly.

228
00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:05.186
Oh. you looking for this?

229
00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:07.841
Why do you want to know?

230
00:11:07.971 --> 00:11:09.799
Worried I'm going
to kill you too?

231
00:11:10.887 --> 00:11:12.193
Because that really depends on

232
00:11:12.323 --> 00:11:14.717
whether you're as flammable
as you are curious.

233
00:11:14.848 --> 00:11:15.805
You find it?

234
00:11:16.806 --> 00:11:18.199
No. I didn't fucking find it.

235
00:11:18.329 --> 00:11:20.157
Why can't I get a fucking
light on in this house?

236
00:11:20.288 --> 00:11:21.245
I don't know.

237
00:11:21.376 --> 00:11:22.812
Will you calm down?

238
00:11:22.943 --> 00:11:24.684
- That's the wrong answer.
you think very carefully

239
00:11:24.814 --> 00:11:26.686
before you speak again.

240
00:11:26.816 --> 00:11:27.817
Maybe the power's down.

241
00:11:27.948 --> 00:11:28.862
There's a fusebox.

242
00:11:28.992 --> 00:11:30.385
Okay. there's a fusebox. good.

243
00:11:30.515 --> 00:11:31.691
Where's the fucking fusebox?

244
00:11:31.821 --> 00:11:34.258
It's Under the stairs.

245
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:35.912
- Come on-
- Wait!

246
00:11:36.043 --> 00:11:37.131
Enough. Jack.

247
00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:38.698
She's going to make
too much noise.

248
00:11:38.828 --> 00:11:40.090
- You going to make
too much noise?

249
00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:41.004
She's fine.

250
00:11:48.664 --> 00:11:49.709
Fix it!

251
00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:51.362
- What?
- Fix it!

252
00:11:51.493 --> 00:11:53.887
I don't know how to fix it.

253
00:11:54.017 --> 00:11:55.715
- Fix it!
- Alright fine. I'm sorry.

254
00:11:55.845 --> 00:11:57.629
its just I can't
actually see anything!

255
00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.587
Oh. fuck.

256
00:12:01.503 --> 00:12:03.723
Well. now you can.

257
00:12:03.853 --> 00:12:05.725
Will you keep your voice down?

258
00:12:05.855 --> 00:12:07.335
We have to be more careful.

259
00:12:07.465 --> 00:12:08.728
It's all over the news.

260
00:12:08.858 --> 00:12:10.120
They closed the roads.

261
00:12:10.251 --> 00:12:11.295
That doesn't change anything.

262
00:12:11.426 --> 00:12:12.688
We always knew
they might do that.

263
00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:13.689
- They're going to start
doing door to-doors.

264
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.125
if they haven't already!

265
00:12:15.256 --> 00:12:17.084
- Well. we will cross
that bridge if it comes.

266
00:12:17.214 --> 00:12:17.998
Anything?

267
00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:19.913
Try it now.

268
00:12:22.654 --> 00:12:24.744
[switch clicking]

269
00:12:24.874 --> 00:12:26.180
Right. that's it!

270
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.703
- No no. wait I. I vaguely
remember them saying

271
00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:29.270
something about this.

272
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.575
I think the fire did something
to the lighting circuit.

273
00:12:30.706 --> 00:12:32.621
It's why we don't do
evening viewings here.

274
00:12:33.448 --> 00:12:34.318
What good is that to me?

275
00:12:34.449 --> 00:12:35.798
I don't know. I'm sorry.

276
00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:38.801
- That's enough. we need
to be sensible right now.

277
00:12:38.932 --> 00:12:40.934
- How we supposed to
do this in the dark?

278
00:12:41.064 --> 00:12:42.326
I don't know!

279
00:12:44.676 --> 00:12:46.766
You could use the work lights.

280
00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:49.943
What?

281
00:12:50.073 --> 00:12:51.335
The workers.

282
00:12:51.466 --> 00:12:52.684
they leave their lights
in the dining room.

283
00:12:52.815 --> 00:12:55.600
They're portable. you
can just plug them in.

284
00:12:55.731 --> 00:12:56.819
And I'm guessing the table lamps

285
00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.386
will probably work as well.

286
00:13:02.564 --> 00:13:04.827
- Well. someone's
a clever captive.

287
00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.568
[hand knocking on door]

288
00:13:06.698 --> 00:13:07.874
[Ruth] Hello.

289
00:13:08.004 --> 00:13:09.223
Shit!

290
00:13:09.353 --> 00:13:11.486
- [Lena] Place is
empty. maybe they'll go.

00:13:12.704 --> 00:13:15.838
[hand knocking on door]

292
00:13:15.969 --> 00:13:17.100
[Ruth] Hello?

293
00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:19.450
We need to get rid of her.

294
00:13:22.453 --> 00:13:23.977
Is everything okay in there?

295
00:13:30.853 --> 00:13:32.289
We could use a bit more tact?

296
00:13:33.377 --> 00:13:34.465
What?

297
00:13:34.596 --> 00:13:35.292
No.

298
00:13:35.423 --> 00:13:36.772
Get to the door.

299
00:13:36.903 --> 00:13:38.295
don't try and be smart.

300
00:13:39.775 --> 00:13:40.863
What am I supposed to say?

301
00:13:40.994 --> 00:13:42.343
Whatever gets rid of her.

302
00:13:42.473 --> 00:13:45.259
- You try and run. I'm
gonna kill you both. clear?

303
00:13:47.043 --> 00:13:49.263
[tense music]

304
00:13:49.393 --> 00:13:50.177
Go.

305
00:14:03.364 --> 00:14:05.975
[tense music]

306
00:14:06.802 --> 00:14:07.542
Sorry to trouble you.

307
00:14:07.672 --> 00:14:09.196
I live next door.

308
00:14:09.326 --> 00:14:10.327
[Matilda] Oh. hi.

309
00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:12.416
I heard noises.

310
00:14:14.027 --> 00:14:15.942
Well the house had
been empty for so long.

311
00:14:16.072 --> 00:14:18.248
I thought I better check
I wasn't going mad.

312
00:14:20.076 --> 00:14:22.209
Is it not still classed
as a crime scene then?

313
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.255
- No. it's just gone
back up on the market.

314
00:14:25.386 --> 00:14:26.213
you know what it's like.

315
00:14:26.343 --> 00:14:27.562
Red tape.

316
00:14:27.692 --> 00:14:28.693
I'm actually the estate agent

317
00:14:28.824 --> 00:14:29.869
for the house.

318

[high pitch

319
00:14:30.739 --> 00:14:31.696
Sorry dear.

320
00:14:31.827 --> 00:14:33.394
I'm having a bit
of trouble with.

321
00:14:35.657 --> 00:14:37.311
[sighing] bloody thing.

322
00:14:37.441 --> 00:14:38.921
Can't hear anything
most of the time.

323
00:14:39.052 --> 00:14:40.444
What did you say dear?

324
00:14:40.575 --> 00:14:42.098
I'm the estate agent.

325
00:14:42.229 --> 00:14:43.056
Oh really?

326
00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.407
You work late. don't you?

327
00:14:46.537 --> 00:14:48.496
- Yeah. er. no. not
normally. it's just because

328
00:14:48.626 --> 00:14:51.542
there's work going on in the
kitchen I've had to oversee.

329
00:14:52.848 --> 00:14:55.459
Oh gosh. from the fire?

330
00:14:56.286 --> 00:14:58.462
- Well. I mean. I can't
really say too much about it.

331
00:14:58.593 --> 00:14:59.420
but yeah.

332
00:15:00.595 --> 00:15:03.467
Oh. terrible that was.

333
00:15:03.598 --> 00:15:05.948
Poor Tom.

334
00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:08.429
He was a lovely lad.

335
00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:10.997
He wasn't here very long.

336
00:15:11.127 --> 00:15:13.956
He always used to
cut my grass for me.

337
00:15:14.087 --> 00:15:15.088
I'm sorry.

338
00:15:18.569 --> 00:15:20.354
- My daughter lives
in Australia now

339
00:15:20.484 --> 00:15:24.227
with my grandson so I really
don't see many people anymore.

340
00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:27.187
Tickets are too expensive
for an old bird like me.

341
00:15:28.449 --> 00:15:29.841
Oh. its okay.

342
00:15:29.972 --> 00:15:33.019
I love my own
company. it's just.

343
00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:35.325
when you see things on
the news like today.

344
00:15:37.023 --> 00:15:40.330
you wonder what the
world is coming to.

345
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:43.899
There's some awful
bad people out there.

346
00:15:45.422 --> 00:15:47.990
What would possess
somebody to...

347
00:15:48.121 --> 00:15:49.339
Oh. my goodness.

348
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.080
What have you done there?

349
00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:51.994
What?

350
00:15:52.125 --> 00:15:53.300
Oh. right.

351
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.997
I caught my head when
I was showing off

352
00:15:55.128 --> 00:15:56.259
the house earlier.

353
00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:57.565
Kitchen cupboard got
the better of me.

354
00:15:57.695 --> 00:15:59.045
Least we know they're sturdy.

355
00:15:59.175 --> 00:16:01.003
- That's a really nasty
cut. let me take a look.

356
00:16:01.134 --> 00:16:03.745
- No. no. no.
honestly. it's fine.

357
00:16:03.875 --> 00:16:05.877
It's just me being clumsy.

358
00:16:06.008 --> 00:16:07.357
Oh. if you're sure.

359
00:16:07.488 --> 00:16:10.143
It's no bother. I've got
a first aid kit next door.

360
00:16:10.273 --> 00:16:13.146
- No. I'm all good. thank
you though. that's very kind.

361
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:15.539
Anyway I'd better
get back to it.

362
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.106
I just want to have a quick
tidy up of the kitchen

363
00:16:17.237 --> 00:16:18.499
before I head off.

364
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:22.024
- Well if you need a
hand with anything. or...

365
00:16:22.155 --> 00:16:24.461
You know where I am.

366
00:16:24.592 --> 00:16:26.072
I'm Ruth by the way.

367
00:16:26.202 --> 00:16:29.075
- I'm Matilda. you have
a good night. Ruth.

368
00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:31.512
Okay. dear. I won't keep you.

369
00:16:31.642 --> 00:16:32.817
You get home safe.

370
00:16:32.948 --> 00:16:34.167
You too. Ruth!

371
00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.171
[tense music]

372
00:16:41.174 --> 00:16:42.001
Ruth?

373
00:16:45.961 --> 00:16:47.223
Yes dear?

374
00:16:47.354 --> 00:16:52.185
[tense music continues]
[fireworks popping]

375
00:16:59.888 --> 00:17:04.893
I hope you get to see
your grandson soon.

376
00:17:06.416 --> 00:17:08.766
- [scoffing] Not unless
I win the lottery.

377
00:17:08.897 --> 00:17:09.941
Night. love.

378
00:17:16.209 --> 00:17:18.820
[tense music]

379
00:17:20.213 --> 00:17:21.344
Lena. just...

380
00:17:22.606 --> 00:17:25.087
Let's get these
lights set up. yeah?

381
00:17:25.218 --> 00:17:26.349
Well go on then.

382
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.307
Run along.

383
00:17:29.004 --> 00:17:31.398
[tense music]

384
00:17:34.662 --> 00:17:36.490
I know it's dark in here.

385
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.232
but I've literally
looked everywhere.

386
00:17:39.362 --> 00:17:41.582
Bastard must've buried it.

387
00:17:41.712 --> 00:17:44.454
I am going to have to dig
up the whole 90 foot garden.

388
00:17:44.585 --> 00:17:47.414
The connect said it's in the
house. not in the grounds.

389
00:17:47.544 --> 00:17:48.632
He was very specific.

390
00:17:49.894 --> 00:17:51.896
Here look. use this.

391
00:17:52.027 --> 00:17:53.246
Try the walls.

392
00:17:53.376 --> 00:17:57.076
I am going to get the
rest of the lights on.

393
00:18:01.254 --> 00:18:03.778
[tense music]

394
00:18:05.258 --> 00:18:06.172
- I don't know what
your looking for

395
00:18:06.302 --> 00:18:08.435
- but I might-
- I don't care.

396
00:18:08.565 --> 00:18:10.480
- I am just saying-
- Don't.

397
00:18:10.611 --> 00:18:11.916
Look. I know this house.

398
00:18:12.047 --> 00:18:13.396
I've been through
every inch of it.

399
00:18:13.527 --> 00:18:14.615
I've seen the paperwork.

400
00:18:14.745 --> 00:18:16.269
Maybe I could help.

401
00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:19.141
How you going to help?

402
00:18:19.272 --> 00:18:20.186
- Tell me what
you're looking for

403
00:18:20.316 --> 00:18:21.187
and I might be able to find it.

404
00:18:21.317 --> 00:18:22.449
You think we're friends now?

405
00:18:22.579 --> 00:18:24.842
Just because you got
rid of the old bird.

406
00:18:24.973 --> 00:18:26.192
- No. I just thought-

407
00:18:26.322 --> 00:18:28.324
- That if you played
nice. we'll let you go?

408
00:18:28.455 --> 00:18:31.675
This is not how this
is going to work.

409
00:18:33.329 --> 00:18:35.157
- Well. there must be
something I can do to-

410
00:18:35.288 --> 00:18:36.550
Get out alive?

411
00:18:38.856 --> 00:18:41.294
[tense music]

412
00:18:42.295 --> 00:18:44.601
Doesn't always go that way.

413
00:18:51.347 --> 00:18:53.915
You know he's going to
make us kill you otherwise.

414
00:18:54.045 --> 00:18:57.179
He's going to make
you kill me anyway.

415
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.746
You know how this goes.

416
00:18:58.876 --> 00:19:00.487
- Well maybe you shouldn't
have fucking snitched.

417
00:19:00.617 --> 00:19:02.053
Oh.

418
00:19:02.184 --> 00:19:04.230
- I mean. come on. an
informant. how stupid is that?

419
00:19:05.579 --> 00:19:08.103
- You don't know
anything about him.

420
00:19:13.195 --> 00:19:16.155
Stuff we are tangled up with.

421
00:19:19.723 --> 00:19:23.727
None of us are getting
out of this alive.

422
00:19:23.858 --> 00:19:25.033
- That's bullshit.
- Listen.

423
00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:26.600
I'm not going to tell anyone.

424
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.515
I haven't seen anything
anyway. I mean. alright fine.

425
00:19:28.645 --> 00:19:30.299
I've seen stuff but. I don't
know what's going on here

426
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:31.779
and I don't care.

427
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:32.780
- Look. if you do want to
stay alive I suggest you

428
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.348
just stop talking. okay?

429
00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:39.569
[tense music]

430
00:19:40.744 --> 00:19:43.399
[keypad beeping]

431
00:19:44.574 --> 00:19:46.228
Sneaky little fucker.

432
00:19:46.359 --> 00:19:47.273
Lena?

433
00:19:47.403 --> 00:19:49.579
Lena. get in here!

434
00:19:51.799 --> 00:19:52.800
Find it?

435
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.237
I think it's behind here.

436
00:19:56.717 --> 00:19:58.371
Get her out of here.

437
00:19:59.807 --> 00:20:00.895
Oh. shit.

438
00:20:01.025 --> 00:20:03.419
[tense music]

439
00:20:05.639 --> 00:20:08.381
[hammer banging]

440
00:20:13.864 --> 00:20:16.911
[fireworks popping]

441
00:20:21.959 --> 00:20:24.092
- Smart move. doing
this on Bonfire Night.

442
00:20:25.485 --> 00:20:26.268
Yeah?

443
00:20:26.399 --> 00:20:28.183
I couldn't even hear it.

444
00:20:28.314 --> 00:20:29.140
Good work.

445
00:20:30.141 --> 00:20:30.838
That a compliment?

446
00:20:30.968 --> 00:20:31.795
Don't worry.

447
00:20:31.926 --> 00:20:32.666
I'm not making it a habit.

448
00:20:34.189 --> 00:20:35.408
Right. lets get this box.

449
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:37.671
[tense music]

450
00:20:37.801 --> 00:20:39.368
- I hope that was worth
taking a bullet for.

451
00:20:45.026 --> 00:20:46.636
Got the code for the safe?

452
00:20:46.767 --> 00:20:47.985
We'll get it on the call.

453
00:20:48.116 --> 00:20:50.031
Did you even read
his instructions?

454
00:20:50.161 --> 00:20:52.033
No. figured you would.

455
00:20:52.163 --> 00:20:53.339
Clearly.

456
00:20:53.469 --> 00:20:56.429
Well. we need to get
the key from in there.

457
00:20:57.517 --> 00:20:58.692
Okay.

458
00:20:58.822 --> 00:20:59.606
Is there anything
in the instructions

459
00:20:59.736 --> 00:21:01.303
about how we get in there?

460
00:21:01.434 --> 00:21:02.826
Don't be a smart ass.

461
00:21:02.957 --> 00:21:06.134
- I'm not. its a
genuine question.

462
00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:08.310
[tense music]

463
00:21:08.441 --> 00:21:09.355
Shit.

464
00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:11.095
Brilliant.

465
00:21:26.415 --> 00:21:28.852
- I feel like you're
messing with me.

466
00:21:29.723 --> 00:21:30.593
I'm not.

467
00:21:30.724 --> 00:21:31.768
There's a knack to it.

468
00:21:31.899 --> 00:21:33.553
Yeah well. it doesn't work.

469
00:21:33.683 --> 00:21:35.294
Obviously not doing it right.

470
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:38.819
Hello?

471
00:21:40.995 --> 00:21:43.040
- I told her to
keep her mouth shut.

472
00:21:43.171 --> 00:21:45.216
Yep. so did I.

473
00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:46.174
Give me that.

474
00:21:52.485 --> 00:21:54.922
[tense music]

475
00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.403
What do you want?

476
00:21:57.533 --> 00:21:59.709
- I'm really sorry
but I need a wee.

477
00:22:00.884 --> 00:22:02.059
Congratulations.

478
00:22:05.541 --> 00:22:06.803
Now who's being brash?

479
00:22:06.934 --> 00:22:07.978
- Well she's doing
my fucking head in.

480
00:22:08.109 --> 00:22:09.458
She needs a wee.

481
00:22:09.589 --> 00:22:11.112
We're killing her anyway.

482
00:22:11.242 --> 00:22:13.070
This will save us
a bathroom break.

483
00:22:13.201 --> 00:22:14.550
Okay. what if the cops come?

484
00:22:14.681 --> 00:22:15.464
Or the neighbor comes back?

485
00:22:15.595 --> 00:22:17.510
She's still got use to us.

486
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.338
Fine. you take her.

487
00:22:19.468 --> 00:22:20.774
I'll get the box open.

488
00:22:21.644 --> 00:22:24.299
[tense music]

489
00:22:47.235 --> 00:22:48.454
Oh.

490
00:22:48.584 --> 00:22:50.456
- What. can't have you
weeing in the dark.

491
00:22:50.586 --> 00:22:51.587
It's fine.

492
00:22:54.721 --> 00:22:57.463
[Lena sighing]

493
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.556
Er. what are you doing?

494
00:23:03.686 --> 00:23:07.908
- Sorry I just. I mean. do you
want to watch me have a wee?

495
00:23:10.214 --> 00:23:12.782
Fine. don't try anything.

496
00:23:16.612 --> 00:23:19.223
[tense music]

497
00:23:45.902 --> 00:23:48.862
I don't hear any
weeing in there.

498
00:23:48.992 --> 00:23:52.561
- Sorry. I can't seem
to go when I'm nervous.

499
00:23:52.692 --> 00:23:55.434
Er. maybe it would help
if we talked a bit.

500
00:23:56.957 --> 00:23:58.524
- Yeah sure. lets. let's
get to know each other.

501
00:23:58.654 --> 00:24:00.526
you on Instagram?

502
00:24:00.656 --> 00:24:01.875
[Matilda] I am actually.

503
00:24:02.005 --> 00:24:04.312
So. I moved to
London when I was 16.

504
00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:07.924
- You're my hostage.
you're not my date.

505
00:24:08.621 --> 00:24:10.579
Why do I give a fuck about that?

506
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.668
So. do you travel much?

507
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:15.671
Are you for real?

508
00:24:16.672 --> 00:24:18.195
- Sorry. it's just
because I love traveling.

509
00:24:18.326 --> 00:24:20.197
I just have not had
the chance to go.

510
00:24:20.328 --> 00:24:22.417
because I haven't got the money.

511
00:24:22.548 --> 00:24:24.114
I've always fancied
living in Amsterdam.

512
00:24:24.245 --> 00:24:25.638
I like all the bikes.

513
00:24:26.639 --> 00:24:28.205
Ridden a few myself.

514
00:24:28.336 --> 00:24:30.120
Oh. have you been?

515
00:24:30.251 --> 00:24:32.383
Fun fact. the motto
under the sign

516
00:24:32.514 --> 00:24:35.778
of Amsterdam means heroic.
determined and merciful.

517
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:37.519
not a lot of people know that.

518
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.303
Not a lot of people care.

519
00:24:39.434 --> 00:24:40.522
That's a useless
bit of information

520
00:24:40.653 --> 00:24:42.698
that I am never
going to use. thanks.

521
00:24:44.395 --> 00:24:45.571
You know if this was a date.

522
00:24:45.701 --> 00:24:47.660
I would have
totally left by now!

523
00:24:51.707 --> 00:24:52.578
Matilda?

524
00:24:55.711 --> 00:24:57.670
[doorknob rattling]

525
00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.714
Matilda?

526
00:25:00.803 --> 00:25:02.326
Matilda. open this door!

527
00:25:04.285 --> 00:25:05.199
[tense music]

528
00:25:05.329 --> 00:25:07.810
[door banging]

529
00:25:11.988 --> 00:25:12.815
Shit!

530
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.426
Shit!

531
00:25:18.865 --> 00:25:21.520
[tense music]

532
00:25:23.478 --> 00:25:24.740
She's escaped.

533
00:25:24.871 --> 00:25:26.873
How could she escape?

534
00:25:27.003 --> 00:25:28.657
- I dunno. one minute she
was talking about Amsterdam.

535
00:25:28.788 --> 00:25:30.616
the next minute she was
out the fucking window.

536
00:25:30.746 --> 00:25:32.226
- Why would you be
talking about Amsterdam?

537
00:25:32.356 --> 00:25:33.401
- I don't. that's not
really the point Lena.

538
00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:34.620
You're an idiot.

539
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:35.882
- Can we just focus
on finding her?

540
00:25:36.012 --> 00:25:37.579
- I told you. we
should have killed her.

541
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:41.627
- Have you got the
keys for the back door?

542
00:25:41.757 --> 00:25:44.412
[tense music]

543
00:25:46.719 --> 00:25:47.371
Hurry up!

544
00:25:47.502 --> 00:25:48.895
The lock is stuck!

545
00:25:49.025 --> 00:25:50.636
Come here.

[Matilda grunting]

558
00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:02.245
- That wasn't a
smart move. was it?

559
00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:04.770
Do you think we're
fucking playing?

560
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.423
No.

561
00:28:06.554 --> 00:28:08.599
- You've no idea who we work
for. what they're capable off.

562
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.037
Do you think I won't
fucking kill you?

563
00:28:11.167 --> 00:28:11.864
Do you?

564
00:28:11.994 --> 00:28:13.213
No!

565
00:28:13.343 --> 00:28:14.780
- Then why would you
do something like that?

566
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.216
Tell me!

567
00:28:16.346 --> 00:28:17.783
- I don't know alright.
I was just scared. okay.

568
00:28:17.913 --> 00:28:18.740
Yeah?

569
00:28:18.871 --> 00:28:19.785
You should be.

[gun firing]

571
00:28:20.916 --> 00:28:21.743
Jesus.

572
00:28:21.874 --> 00:28:22.701
The noise. Jack!

573
00:28:22.831 --> 00:28:24.180
What the hell are you doing?

574
00:28:24.311 --> 00:28:25.399
Could you open the lock box?

575
00:28:25.529 --> 00:28:26.400
No.

576
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:27.575
Now you can.

577
00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:31.797
You are right about her.

578
00:28:31.927 --> 00:28:32.798
Can't be trusted.

579
00:28:32.928 --> 00:28:34.103
No. please.

580
00:28:34.234 --> 00:28:35.539
I'm sorry. I won't
do it again. I swear.

581
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:36.845
Too bloody right you won't.

582
00:28:36.976 --> 00:28:38.586
I should have done
this straight away.

583
00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:40.501
[Matilda] What?

584
00:28:40.631 --> 00:28:41.502
Hold her still.

585
00:28:42.938 --> 00:28:45.462
No. no please. I'm sorry. no!

586
00:28:47.421 --> 00:28:48.944
[Lena] Pull her hair up.

587
00:28:49.075 --> 00:28:51.251
No. please stop. stop.

588
00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:52.034
Please.

[gasping] What is this?

592
00:29:06.048 --> 00:29:09.573
- It's a leaving present.
you want to go so badly.

593
00:29:09.704 --> 00:29:10.705
be my guest.

594
00:29:11.532 --> 00:29:13.012
What does it do?

595
00:29:13.142 --> 00:29:15.318
- Let me make something
clear to you. okay.

596
00:29:17.233 --> 00:29:19.148
I'm not asking.

597
00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:21.890
[tense music]

[collar beeping]
[electricity crackling]

601
00:30:55.592 --> 00:30:58.726
- Can't believe they
put those on dogs.

602
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:01.642
- Not at this
strength they don't.

603
00:31:03.078 --> 00:31:05.733
[tense music]

604
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:32.107
Be my guest.

[tense music]

606
00:31:40.202 --> 00:31:41.551
Oh. hallelujah.

607
00:31:42.596 --> 00:31:43.423
Easy.

608
00:31:44.554 --> 00:31:47.253
- Right. I'm
calling the connect.

609
00:32:01.571 --> 00:32:03.269
I've got the key.

610
00:32:03.399 --> 00:32:04.096
Great.

611
00:32:04.226 --> 00:32:05.706
[line ringing]

612
00:32:05.836 --> 00:32:07.534
- [Charlie] Do
you have the safe?

613
00:32:07.664 --> 00:32:08.839
Yes sir.

614
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:13.670
[Charlie] And the key?

615
00:32:13.801 --> 00:32:15.020
Ready to go.

616
00:32:16.108 --> 00:32:22.027
- [Charlie] Input
the code 1979113.

617
00:32:22.331 --> 00:32:24.638
[keypad beeping]

618
00:32:24.768 --> 00:32:27.380
[safe whirring]

619
00:32:30.209 --> 00:32:31.950
What's happening?

620
00:32:33.516 --> 00:32:34.343
Hello?

621
00:32:36.215 --> 00:32:37.520
Can somebody talk to me?

622
00:32:37.651 --> 00:32:40.654
- Sir-
- What did you do?

623
00:32:40.784 --> 00:32:42.090
- [Lena] Jack must have
input the code wrong.

624
00:32:42.221 --> 00:32:43.309
Didn't input the code wrong.

625
00:32:43.439 --> 00:32:44.658
I turned the key

626
00:32:44.788 --> 00:32:46.660
and inputted the code
that he said. exactly-

627
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.314
- I don't know.
- Stop. stop.

628
00:32:48.444 --> 00:32:50.316
- You must have
done it wrong Jack!

629
00:32:50.446 --> 00:32:51.970
Jack. say that again!

630
00:32:55.147 --> 00:32:56.670
- I turned the key. and
then I inputed the code

631
00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.801
that you just said.

632
00:32:59.107 --> 00:33:00.804
You turned the key first?

633
00:33:02.893 --> 00:33:03.720
Did you?

634
00:33:05.287 --> 00:33:08.247
You fucking amateur!

635
00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:12.425
Did you not read the
instructions that I sent you?

636
00:33:12.555 --> 00:33:13.165
We did sir.

637
00:33:13.295 --> 00:33:14.122
Shut up Lena.

638
00:33:14.253 --> 00:33:15.254
Jack?

639
00:33:18.344 --> 00:33:23.349
Right. well I will
take that as a no.

640
00:33:26.221 --> 00:33:29.181
Right. well. you are just
going to have to sit there

641
00:33:29.311 --> 00:33:31.139
for the next 10 hours.

642
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:32.140
10 hours?

643
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:33.489
Er. yes.

644
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.362
It's an automatic
lockdown safety feature

645
00:33:36.492 --> 00:33:41.149
on most modern safes. if the
codes are entered incorrectly.

646
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.716
which of course you would know.

647
00:33:42.846 --> 00:33:45.588
if you'd read my
fucking instructions!

648
00:33:47.895 --> 00:33:49.375
There has to be a work around?

649
00:33:50.941 --> 00:33:52.291
Way round?

650
00:33:52.421 --> 00:33:55.207
Do you think I would have
orchestrated all of this

651
00:33:55.337 --> 00:33:58.036
if there was a way
round. you idiot!

652
00:33:59.689 --> 00:34:02.953
- With respect. we can't. we
can't hide here for 10 hours.

653
00:34:03.084 --> 00:34:05.130
The police are
doing door-to-doors.

654
00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.046
- Well then I suggest you sit
there very still and quiet.

655
00:34:10.831 --> 00:34:13.312
[tense music]

656
00:34:16.228 --> 00:34:19.579
I don't want to hear
from you until morning

657
00:34:19.709 --> 00:34:20.971
when we try again.

658
00:34:22.321 --> 00:34:26.238
And for your sake.
I hope it goes better.

659
00:34:28.327 --> 00:34:29.110
Understood?

660
00:34:30.546 --> 00:34:31.373
- Sir. I-

661
00:34:41.644 --> 00:34:43.472
Well this is a clusterfuck.

662
00:34:43.603 --> 00:34:44.821
You think?

663
00:34:44.952 --> 00:34:46.345
- What are we
supposed to do now?

664
00:34:47.128 --> 00:34:48.695
- Guess we need
to kill 10 hours.

665
00:34:49.913 --> 00:34:51.045
Any suggestions?

666
00:35:02.709 --> 00:35:03.536
Maybe one?

667
00:35:10.891 --> 00:35:13.372
[tense music]

668
00:35:24.557 --> 00:35:26.211
That was a bit excessive.

669
00:35:26.341 --> 00:35:27.255
Thanks.

670
00:35:27.386 --> 00:35:28.561
That wasn't a...

671
00:35:28.691 --> 00:35:30.389
What's your deal
with fire anyway?

672
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:32.391
It's unforgiving.

673
00:35:32.521 --> 00:35:33.392
Sit.

674
00:35:35.568 --> 00:35:38.832
Not there.

675
00:35:38.962 --> 00:35:42.401
[tense music continues]

676
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.898
Shouldn't one of us
keep a level head?

677
00:36:02.029 --> 00:36:03.509
Probably.

678
00:36:04.597 --> 00:36:05.772
Fuck it!

679
00:36:05.902 --> 00:36:08.296
[tense music continues]

680
00:36:08.427 --> 00:36:09.210
Mmm.

681
00:36:13.432 --> 00:36:14.433
Okay.

682
00:36:23.877 --> 00:36:24.791
[Matilda] I'll pass.

683
00:36:24.921 --> 00:36:26.184
You're fucking drinking it.

684
00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:30.884
Ugh. God. what is it?

685
00:36:31.014 --> 00:36:31.754
It's your medicine.

686
00:36:31.885 --> 00:36:32.668
It's your medicine.

687
00:36:32.799 --> 00:36:34.104
Alright. can we just...

688
00:36:35.454 --> 00:36:36.977
We've got a few hours to kill.

689
00:36:37.107 --> 00:36:38.457
No harm taking the edge off.

690
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.678
See. she loves it.

691
00:36:42.809 --> 00:36:44.419
It's disgusting.

692
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.769
- Oh. I know. I think she wants
me to get my gun out again.

693
00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.467
Fucking drink the drink.

694
00:36:53.472 --> 00:36:56.388
[coughing] That's strong.

695
00:36:56.518 --> 00:37:00.348
- Just relax. and
it will go easier.

696
00:37:00.479 --> 00:37:01.349
What will?

697
00:37:02.307 --> 00:37:04.178
Salvia drops in rum.

698
00:37:05.092 --> 00:37:05.919
Salvia?

699
00:37:07.442 --> 00:37:10.576
Think absinthe on steroids.

700
00:37:11.054 --> 00:37:12.752
[Jack] Hey. we shared.

701
00:37:12.882 --> 00:37:14.319
Say thank you.

702
00:37:15.494 --> 00:37:16.364
Thanks.

703
00:37:16.495 --> 00:37:19.106
[tense music]

704
00:37:28.724 --> 00:37:33.773
Oi.

705
00:37:36.515 --> 00:37:38.517
Think there's anything
else in the safe?

706
00:37:39.605 --> 00:37:40.519
Does it matter?

707
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.739
I'm more intrigued
about the recording.

708
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:45.480
Ha.

709
00:37:45.611 --> 00:37:48.614
I want to know why he wants to
get his hands on it so badly.

710
00:37:48.744 --> 00:37:52.270
- Well. whatever it is. I suspect
it could kick up a lot of dust.

711
00:37:54.184 --> 00:37:57.318
- We could listen to it.
before we hand if off.

712
00:37:58.145 --> 00:37:59.668
No. that's playing with fire.

713
00:37:59.799 --> 00:38:01.409
Isn't that what you do best?

714
00:38:02.845 --> 00:38:04.151
Don't get carried away.

715
00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:06.109
There's still work to do.

716
00:38:07.415 --> 00:38:10.853
Yeah. I know.

717
00:38:10.984 --> 00:38:13.421
[tense music]

718
00:38:13.552 --> 00:38:14.466
[Lena] What's up?

719
00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:16.598
[Jack] Those people.

720
00:38:16.729 --> 00:38:18.208
- [Lena] Oh. don't
get started with that.

721
00:38:18.339 --> 00:38:19.427
not when you're like this.

722
00:38:19.558 --> 00:38:20.428
- [Jack] What
happened to that kid.

723
00:38:20.559 --> 00:38:21.734
That wasn't part of the plan.

724
00:38:21.864 --> 00:38:23.388
- [Lena] That's never
part of the plan.

725
00:38:23.518 --> 00:38:25.215
You can't focus on that.

726
00:38:26.565 --> 00:38:27.870
We did the job.

727
00:38:28.001 --> 00:38:29.263
We got paid.

728
00:38:29.655 --> 00:38:31.700
Collateral damage.

729
00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:34.529
- [Jack] Fucking hell
Lena. collateral damage?

730
00:38:35.487 --> 00:38:36.923
Do you feel anything?

731
00:38:39.186 --> 00:38:40.579
[Lena] Not for a long time.

732
00:38:45.497 --> 00:38:47.281
- Okay. I'm feeling
pretty high now.

733
00:38:48.108 --> 00:38:50.502
She's going to be
out for a while.

734
00:38:50.632 --> 00:38:53.374
I am going to get a shower.
try level myself out.

735
00:38:53.505 --> 00:38:55.420
Don't kill her!

[dramatic orchestral

739
00:39:50.866 --> 00:39:52.825
[Charlie] Jack's a liability.

740
00:39:52.955 --> 00:39:55.523
but I expected more from Lena.

741
00:39:55.654 --> 00:39:56.872
- [Jordan] You
heard anything else?

742
00:39:57.003 --> 00:39:58.526
[Charlie] No.

743
00:39:58.657 --> 00:40:01.311
They'll just have to
sit tight till morning.

744
00:40:02.269 --> 00:40:03.313
[Jordan] So do we.

745
00:40:06.142 --> 00:40:07.405
We can wait.

746
00:40:09.102 --> 00:40:10.582
The important thing is
that we have to get back

747
00:40:10.712 --> 00:40:14.542
that recording device. it's
the only thing tying me

748
00:40:14.673 --> 00:40:15.674
to those fires.

749
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:18.416
Clean slate.

750
00:40:19.634 --> 00:40:20.418
Yes.

751
00:40:22.332 --> 00:40:23.725
Press conference went well.

752
00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:26.685
Better than expected.

753
00:40:32.212 --> 00:40:33.605
Happy Bonfire Night.

Where the fuck's Lena?

758
00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:28.311
Er. outside I think.

759
00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:31.619
[Jack] And you didn't run?

760
00:41:32.533 --> 00:41:33.665
Front door's locked.

761
00:41:37.712 --> 00:41:38.539
That looks pretty bad.

762
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:39.540
Eh?

763
00:41:39.671 --> 00:41:40.498
Your wound.

764
00:41:41.716 --> 00:41:42.935
It's nothing.

765
00:41:43.065 --> 00:41:45.633
- It's been bleeding
since this afternoon.

766
00:41:45.764 --> 00:41:46.808
So?

767
00:41:46.939 --> 00:41:48.114
So you're loosing
a lot of blood.

768
00:41:48.244 --> 00:41:49.811
What do you care?

769
00:41:51.378 --> 00:41:52.205

771
00:42:30.809 --> 00:42:32.985
- Right. I'm gonna need
you to help me cauterize

772
00:42:33.115 --> 00:42:34.726
the exit wound.

773
00:42:34.856 --> 00:42:36.510
What?

774
00:42:36.641 --> 00:42:37.642
Come here.

775
00:42:41.384 --> 00:42:42.690
- I have no idea how to-

776
00:42:42.821 --> 00:42:44.997
- You have just
seen me do this one.

777
00:42:45.127 --> 00:42:47.390
- Oh. so that makes
me an expert does it?

778
00:42:47.521 --> 00:42:48.566
Are you actually insane?

779
00:42:48.696 --> 00:42:49.741
I'm a fucking estate agent!

780
00:42:49.871 --> 00:42:50.959
Not a very good one.

781
00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:52.874
- Yep. well today's
not my best day.

782
00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:57.836
You gonna help me with this

783
00:42:57.966 --> 00:42:59.533
or are you still pissed off

784
00:42:59.664 --> 00:43:01.230
I held a gun at you?

785
00:43:01.361 --> 00:43:03.755
- You know you don't always
have to threaten people

786
00:43:03.885 --> 00:43:06.235
with violence to
get what you want.

787
00:43:06.366 --> 00:43:09.935
- I agree. but it does
speed up the process.

788
00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:16.898
I am not threatening you.
I'm asking you nicely.

789
00:43:23.078 --> 00:43:23.905
Fine.

790
00:43:26.908 --> 00:43:28.780
Hold the blade in the flame

791
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:30.433
till it gets really hot.

792
00:43:30.564 --> 00:43:32.087
Really hot. okay?

793
00:43:32.218 --> 00:43:34.307
You're going to press it
down on the exit wound.

794
00:43:34.437 --> 00:43:36.875
flat across. hard.

795
00:43:42.924 --> 00:43:45.753
- Okay. I'm just
heating the blade.

796
00:43:45.884 --> 00:43:47.929
- It's probably best
if you don't narrate.

797

[Jack gasping]

798
00:43:56.764 --> 00:43:58.636
- What?
- Your hands are cold.

799
00:43:58.766 --> 00:43:59.811
You're ridiculous.

800
00:44:00.681 --> 00:44:03.510
All right this might
sting a bit okay?

801
00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:04.772
- Mm-hmm.

802
00:44:04.903 --> 00:44:06.644
Okay. ready?

Fuck! [grunting]

806
00:44:12.432 --> 00:44:13.912
Okay. okay.

807
00:44:14.042 --> 00:44:15.827
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

808
00:44:15.957 --> 00:44:17.785
Okay. you are done.

809
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:30.842
Thank you.

810
00:44:30.972 --> 00:44:32.278
That smell.

811
00:44:32.408 --> 00:44:34.454
Yeah. I hate it.

812
00:44:38.371 --> 00:44:39.894
So. what did she do to him?

813
00:44:42.201 --> 00:44:44.333
- Well. you've seen the
state of the kitchen.

814
00:44:45.421 --> 00:44:47.249
- The neighbor said
his name was Tom?

815
00:44:53.995 --> 00:44:56.345
I think about it sometimes.

816
00:44:58.826 --> 00:45:00.654
When he started
screaming. it didn't.

817
00:45:01.786 --> 00:45:03.048
it didn't even sound human.

[footsteps thudding]

819
00:45:07.313 --> 00:45:10.751
- Think that's enough
chit-chat for now. don't you?

820
00:45:10.882 --> 00:45:12.492
Why don't we go on a nice walk

821
00:45:12.622 --> 00:45:14.189
and you can see all
the pretty fireworks?

Stunning. isn't it?

826
00:45:40.041 --> 00:45:42.043
Don't be scared. kitten.

827
00:45:43.175 --> 00:45:44.089
Take it in.

828
00:45:47.483 --> 00:45:49.050
I made us a fire.

829
00:45:50.225 --> 00:45:52.793
Thought it might make
things cozy. hmmm?

830
00:45:52.924 --> 00:45:53.794
What do you think.

831
00:45:55.404 --> 00:45:59.539
Yeah. um. thank you?

832
00:45:59.669 --> 00:46:02.890
- Aw. look who finally
found her manners.

833
00:46:03.021 --> 00:46:04.936
Go on then. I'm
right behind you.

834
00:46:05.066 --> 00:46:06.676
No. it's fine I'm not-

835
00:46:06.807 --> 00:46:09.027
Go on. go warm yourself.

836
00:46:10.071 --> 00:46:12.073
It's a beautiful view
of the fireworks.

837
00:46:14.249 --> 00:46:15.598
Do I have a choice?

00:46:16.512 --> 00:46:17.339

house next door.

00:47:07.737 --> 00:47:08.390
With me.

850
00:47:08.521 --> 00:47:09.565
Put that fire out!

851
00:47:09.696 --> 00:47:10.262
- How the fuck am
I gonna do that?

852
00:47:10.392 --> 00:47:11.002
I don't know.

853
00:47:11.132 --> 00:47:12.046

Get in there!

857
00:47:38.899 --> 00:47:40.553
Okay. stay away
from the windows.

858
00:47:40.683 --> 00:47:41.336
Where's the girl?

859
00:47:41.467 --> 00:47:42.250
Secured.

860
00:47:42.381 --> 00:47:43.034
You get the fire?

861
00:47:43.164 --> 00:47:44.035
Yeah.

862
00:47:44.165 --> 00:47:44.905
Okay. lets go.

00:47:47.647 --> 00:47:48.735
What're you knocking for?

865
00:47:48.866 --> 00:47:50.345
We know it's empty.

866
00:47:50.476 --> 00:47:51.781
Well. I don't know.

867
00:47:51.912 --> 00:47:53.174
Force of habit I suppose.

868
00:47:54.175 --> 00:47:55.785
Some kids might
have broke in or-

869
00:47:57.222 --> 00:47:59.615
- And you think they're
going to answer the door?

870
00:47:59.746 --> 00:48:01.356
Just make yourself useful
and go knock the blue lights

871
00:48:01.487 --> 00:48:03.054
off the car.

872
00:48:03.184 --> 00:48:05.708
I like the blue lights.

Foster. is anyone in there?

[tense music continues]

877
00:48:27.426 --> 00:48:28.253
Hello?

878
00:48:31.212 --> 00:48:32.039
Any joy?

879
00:48:34.737 --> 00:48:35.564
Can't see shit.

880
00:48:36.826 --> 00:48:37.653
Ah.

881
00:48:38.698 --> 00:48:40.395
Looks pretty quiet to me.

882
00:48:40.526 --> 00:48:41.614
What do you reckon?

883
00:48:41.744 --> 00:48:43.094
Have a look inside?

884
00:48:43.224 --> 00:48:45.226
- What have I told you
about reasonable grounds?

885
00:48:45.357 --> 00:48:46.967
Don't you recognize this house?

886
00:48:47.925 --> 00:48:48.926
No.

887
00:48:49.056 --> 00:48:50.101
Should I?

888
00:48:50.231 --> 00:48:51.798
The Tom Allans fire.

889
00:48:54.453 --> 00:48:56.411
Oh my god.

890
00:48:56.542 --> 00:48:58.109
What. that was in here?

891
00:48:58.239 --> 00:49:00.676
- Come on. lets move
onto the next house.

892
00:49:02.243 --> 00:49:04.767
[tense music]

893
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:08.510
[gun thudding]

894
00:49:11.252 --> 00:49:12.427
[Daniels] What was that?

895
00:49:12.558 --> 00:49:14.212
I don't know.

896
00:49:14.342 --> 00:49:17.258
Let's take a look
around the back.

897
00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:21.654
Turn the light off.

898
00:49:31.272 --> 00:49:32.578
Mind your step.

899
00:49:34.275 --> 00:49:35.842
The lights are on in the garden.

900
00:49:37.539 --> 00:49:39.324
- They're solar
powered fairy lights.

901
00:49:40.629 --> 00:49:42.936
Jackie's got some up
around the decking. so...

902
00:49:44.111 --> 00:49:47.332
[tense music continues]

903
00:49:49.334 --> 00:49:50.248
It might help if you tell me

904
00:49:50.378 --> 00:49:53.338
what we're looking for. exactly.

905
00:49:53.468 --> 00:49:55.035
Two assailants. armed.

906
00:49:55.166 --> 00:49:56.210
Could still be in the area.

907
00:49:56.341 --> 00:49:57.081
Sorry. what?

908
00:49:57.211 --> 00:49:58.604
Armed?

909
00:49:58.734 --> 00:50:01.259
- Don't worry. I heard one
of them's wounded anyway.

910
00:50:01.389 --> 00:50:02.390
Oh. right.

911
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:06.307
What happened?

912
00:50:06.438 --> 00:50:09.223
- Owner took a pop shot
with an unlicensed gun.

913
00:50:09.354 --> 00:50:11.617
Hopefully they find
him dead in a ditch.

914
00:50:11.747 --> 00:50:13.488
How do you know he's a he?

915
00:50:13.619 --> 00:50:14.446
Fair point.

916
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:18.102
Well. there's nothing in here.

917
00:50:18.232 --> 00:50:20.495
Just a load of decorating stuff.

918
00:50:20.626 --> 00:50:22.019
- Yeah. the neighbor
said they've been having

919
00:50:22.149 --> 00:50:23.237
some work done.

920
00:50:23.368 --> 00:50:25.152
Back on the market
now. apparently.

921
00:50:25.283 --> 00:50:27.067
[Daniels] Oh. right.

922
00:50:30.288 --> 00:50:32.203
[fireworks popping]

923
00:50:32.333 --> 00:50:34.248
[Foster] What is it?

924
00:50:34.379 --> 00:50:38.339
[suspenseful orchestral music]

925
00:51:01.971 --> 00:51:05.758
So is this where it went down?

926
00:51:06.411 --> 00:51:07.803
- Poor bastard was
found. tied up.

927
00:51:07.934 --> 00:51:09.283
charred to a crisp.

928
00:51:09.414 --> 00:51:10.371
Pathologists said
he was still alive

929
00:51:10.502 --> 00:51:12.417
when they lit him up.

930
00:51:13.418 --> 00:51:15.594
That's a nasty way to go.

931
00:51:15.724 --> 00:51:17.944
[suspenseful music]

932
00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:19.554
[fireworks popping]

933
00:51:19.685 --> 00:51:20.860
Fucking hell!

934
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:25.778
What?

935
00:51:27.214 --> 00:51:28.520
Made me jump.

936
00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:30.304
Obviously.

937
00:51:30.435 --> 00:51:31.653
Let's just do a
sweep of the garden

938
00:51:31.784 --> 00:51:33.438
and head out.

939
00:51:33.568 --> 00:51:35.744
- [Dispatch] Dispatch
controller to car.

940
00:51:35.875 --> 00:51:37.311
Mike Bravo 369 are
you receiving over?

941
00:51:37.442 --> 00:51:40.532
- Receiving you loud and
clear dispatch. go ahead.

942
00:51:40.662 --> 00:51:43.970
- [Dispatch] State zero needed
in Kenmore Crescent. over.

943
00:51:44.101 --> 00:51:45.450
Roger that. dispatch.

944
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.451
On our way.

945
00:51:47.408 --> 00:51:48.540
Oi.

946
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:50.629
Back in the car.

947
00:51:50.759 --> 00:51:53.414
[tense music]

948
00:52:01.466 --> 00:52:02.554
[engine starting]

949
00:52:02.684 --> 00:52:05.470
[siren wailing]

950
00:52:14.957 --> 00:52:16.655
That was too close.

951
00:52:18.483 --> 00:52:21.834
- We need to stay upstairs
until the time's up.

952
00:52:21.964 --> 00:52:23.270
It'll be safer.

953
00:52:25.664 --> 00:52:28.362
- Yeah.
- Where is she?

954
00:52:28.493 --> 00:52:29.363
Locked in the cupboard.

955
00:52:29.494 --> 00:52:33.062
Under the stairs.

956
00:52:33.193 --> 00:52:35.978
Good. she can stay there.

957
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:38.764
It'll keep her out of trouble.

958
00:52:38.894 --> 00:52:39.721
Come on.

959
00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:42.376
You go ahead.

960
00:52:42.507 --> 00:52:44.422
I'll just check on her.

961
00:52:45.379 --> 00:52:48.077
[dramatic music]

962
00:53:03.354 --> 00:53:05.834
How you bearing up in there?

963
00:53:05.965 --> 00:53:07.923
- I've rented smaller
places in London.

964
00:53:08.054 --> 00:53:10.491
- [sighing] Well.
get used to it.

965
00:53:10.622 --> 00:53:13.581
Try get some sleep. 'cause
you're not going anywhere. okay?

966
00:53:16.105 --> 00:53:16.932
Room service.

967
00:53:18.282 --> 00:53:19.413
Night. Matilda.

968
00:53:19.544 --> 00:53:22.199
[door slamming]

969
00:53:26.986 --> 00:53:30.555
[dramatic orchestral music]

970
00:53:34.863 --> 00:53:35.690
Romantic.

971
00:53:38.476 --> 00:53:41.000
[Jack sighing]

972
00:53:57.234 --> 00:53:58.583
I'm knackered.

973
00:53:59.453 --> 00:54:00.367
Yeah.

974
00:54:00.498 --> 00:54:01.281
Same.

975
00:54:02.935 --> 00:54:05.242
I'll take the first
watch though. yeah?

976
00:54:05.372 --> 00:54:06.025
You sure.

977
00:54:06.155 --> 00:54:06.982
- Mmm-hmm.

978
00:54:07.983 --> 00:54:08.810
Thanks.

979
00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:14.425
Wake me up if you hear anything.

980
00:54:14.555 --> 00:54:16.557
I'll shut her up myself.

981
00:54:27.481 --> 00:54:28.265
Lena?

982
00:54:29.178 --> 00:54:30.005
Hm?

983
00:54:32.007 --> 00:54:34.575
Don't you ever feel guilty?

984
00:54:34.706 --> 00:54:37.230
Guilt doesn't help anybody.

985
00:54:39.624 --> 00:54:42.322
Are you still going on
about that lab fire?

986
00:54:42.453 --> 00:54:43.541
- No one was
supposed to be there.

987
00:54:43.671 --> 00:54:47.153
You've got to let it go. Jack.

988
00:54:47.284 --> 00:54:49.764
We weren't told there'd be
anybody in the building.

989
00:54:49.895 --> 00:54:53.072
I can only go off the
details we're given.

990
00:54:53.202 --> 00:54:54.291
And to be quite honest with you.

991
00:54:54.421 --> 00:54:56.510
would that have
changed anything?

992
00:54:56.641 --> 00:55:01.646
- Yeah. I would. I'm
not a kid killer.

993
00:55:01.907 --> 00:55:03.082
We are now.

994
00:55:09.654 --> 00:55:12.570
We were just doing
our job. okay?

995
00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.442
If anyone should feel guilty.
it's the Connect. not us.

996
00:55:18.663 --> 00:55:20.578
Where's all this coming from?

997
00:55:22.057 --> 00:55:23.363
I don't know.

998
00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:26.671
This house. maybe.

999
00:55:28.107 --> 00:55:30.979
Being here is weird.
after what we did to Tom.

1000
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:32.154
Yeah. and if we didn't.

1001
00:55:32.285 --> 00:55:33.460
he would have turned
to the police.

1002
00:55:33.591 --> 00:55:35.070
And do you think if
the Connect goes down.

1003
00:55:35.201 --> 00:55:36.724
we're not gonna
go down with him?

1004
00:55:39.336 --> 00:55:40.641
No.

1005
00:55:40.772 --> 00:55:41.947
- And do you really want
to go back to prison?

1006
00:55:42.077 --> 00:55:42.730
God. no.

1007
00:55:42.861 --> 00:55:44.297
No. never.

1008
00:55:44.689 --> 00:55:45.690
Exactly.

1009
00:55:47.344 --> 00:55:49.041
Stop overthinking it.

1010
00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:52.958
It is what it is.

1011
00:56:01.314 --> 00:56:04.143
Yeah.

1012
00:56:04.273 --> 00:56:05.710
It is what it is.

1013
00:56:14.327 --> 00:56:16.721
[tense music]

1014
00:56:24.337 --> 00:56:27.079
[birds chirping]

1015
00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:36.915
[tense music]

1016
00:56:37.045 --> 00:56:38.612
There's this little
bakery. literally.

1017
00:56:38.743 --> 00:56:40.919
just around the corner.

1018
00:56:41.049 --> 00:56:42.703
How handy is that?

1019
00:56:43.617 --> 00:56:44.444
Oh. my god.

1020
00:56:44.575 --> 00:56:46.228
Okay. you have to try this.

1021
00:56:46.359 --> 00:56:47.186
Here.

1022
00:56:48.753 --> 00:56:51.059
Oh. yeah. they did coffee too.

1023
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:52.800
Two sugars. yeah?

1024
00:56:52.931 --> 00:56:54.062
[Jack] Yeah. thanks.

1025
00:56:56.282 --> 00:56:58.763
Well. this is cozy. isn't it?

1026
00:57:01.766 --> 00:57:03.245
You sleep okay. princess?

1027
00:57:03.376 --> 00:57:05.117
Oh yeah. it was lovely.

1028
00:57:05.247 --> 00:57:07.772
- You know. you should
really eat something.

1029
00:57:08.773 --> 00:57:09.643
You're wasting away.

1030
00:57:09.774 --> 00:57:11.428
Okay. stop.

1031
00:57:11.558 --> 00:57:13.038
What. what is this?

1032
00:57:14.822 --> 00:57:17.695
- Er. the most important
meal of the day. obviously.

1033
00:57:17.825 --> 00:57:19.784
- No. I mean like
what's with you?

1034
00:57:19.914 --> 00:57:21.742
What's going on here?

1035
00:57:21.873 --> 00:57:24.919
- Jack. how long have
we worked together?

1036
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:26.617
[Jack] Couple of years. why?

1037
00:57:26.747 --> 00:57:28.662
- Well then you should
know. I hate having to kill

1038
00:57:28.793 --> 00:57:29.794
on an empty stomach.

1039
00:57:31.709 --> 00:57:32.927
No. Lena. wait!

1040
00:57:33.058 --> 00:57:35.190
- The safe is going
tho be open in an hour.

1041
00:57:35.321 --> 00:57:36.714
we don't need her anymore.

1042
00:57:37.802 --> 00:57:38.933
We haven't discussed this.

1043
00:57:39.064 --> 00:57:40.500
She's seen our faces.

1044
00:57:40.631 --> 00:57:41.719
She knows our names. Jack.

1045
00:57:41.849 --> 00:57:43.503
It's too dangerous
to let her live.

1046
00:57:43.634 --> 00:57:45.505
even if I wanted to
which. honestly. I don't.

1047
00:57:45.636 --> 00:57:46.550
[gun cocking]

1048
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.812
Just think about this.

1049
00:57:48.813 --> 00:57:50.292
Oh. come on Jack.

1050
00:57:50.423 --> 00:57:51.772
I know you've grown fond of
little Polly Pocket here.

1051
00:57:51.903 --> 00:57:53.470
but you know I'm right.

1052
00:57:54.819 --> 00:57:56.342
And here we are. madam.

1053
00:57:56.473 --> 00:58:00.912
[door clicking]
[tense music]

1054
00:58:01.042 --> 00:58:03.784
- What do you think?
- Thank you.

1055
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:14.360
What would the neighbors say?

1056
00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:16.493
Not very professional. are we?

1057
00:58:17.668 --> 00:58:19.931
Am I going to have to have
a word with your manager?

1058
00:58:20.061 --> 00:58:21.759
[Ethan] No. miss.

1059
00:58:28.243 --> 00:58:31.377
- Oooh. this place
is nice. isn't it?

1060
00:58:34.467 --> 00:58:35.729
Airy. bright.

1061
00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:39.167
- and the bedroom is-
- Not on the ground floor.

1062
00:58:39.298 --> 00:58:40.734
Is this your first viewing?

1063
00:58:40.865 --> 00:58:43.215
Who the fuck are they?

1064
00:58:43.345 --> 00:58:44.869
- Sounds like Ethan.
- Who?

1065
00:58:44.999 --> 00:58:46.087
Girls!

1066
00:58:46.218 --> 00:58:47.654
- [Matilda] He
works in my office.

1067
00:58:47.785 --> 00:58:49.700
- You little shit. what
the hell is he doing here?

1068
00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:51.397
- Girls. seriously. shh.
they're gonna hear you.

1069
00:58:51.528 --> 00:58:52.703
- [Matilda] How the
fuck should I know!

1070
00:58:52.833 --> 00:58:54.966
- You better watch
your mouth or I'll-

1071
00:58:55.096 --> 00:58:56.489
Lena. stop.

1072
00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:57.708
Or you'll what?

1073
00:58:57.838 --> 00:58:58.622
I'm not fucking
scared of you. Lena.

1074
00:58:58.752 --> 00:58:59.884
Oh. that's your mistake.

1075
00:59:00.885 --> 00:59:01.929
[electricity crackling]

1076
00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:02.756
No!

1077
00:59:02.887 --> 00:59:04.062
Stop!

1078
00:59:04.192 --> 00:59:07.587
[electricity crackling]

1079
00:59:08.719 --> 00:59:10.808
[Jack grunting]

1080
00:59:10.938 --> 00:59:11.939
Fuck. fuck!

1081
00:59:13.941 --> 00:59:16.770
You're a fucking
bitch sometimes. Lena.

1082
00:59:16.901 --> 00:59:18.163
I know!

1083
00:59:18.293 --> 00:59:19.556
We should hide upstairs.

1084
00:59:19.686 --> 00:59:21.079
Yeah. take that.

1085
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:24.343
Wait for my cue.

1086
00:59:27.955 --> 00:59:29.348
Steph. come on.

1087
00:59:29.478 --> 00:59:31.045
We don't have a lot of time.

1088
00:59:31.176 --> 00:59:33.308
- Your first viewing
doesn't start until 11.

1089
00:59:33.439 --> 00:59:35.049
- Now show me.
- Show you?

1090
00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.834
Where that guy died.

1091
00:59:36.964 --> 00:59:38.357
Is it down here?

1092
00:59:39.967 --> 00:59:42.491
[tense music]

1093
00:59:48.454 --> 00:59:50.456
- [Ethan] You know we
really shouldn't be in here.

1094
00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:51.326
[Steph] Why?

1095
00:59:51.457 --> 00:59:52.414
You scared?

1096
00:59:52.545 --> 00:59:53.372
Of you?

1097
00:59:53.502 --> 00:59:55.722
- Maybe a little.
- Oh.

1098
01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:04.644
Quick. get her under the bed.

1099
01:00:04.775 --> 01:00:06.907
[tense music]

1100
01:00:07.038 --> 01:00:09.127
[Jack grunting]

1101
01:00:09.257 --> 01:00:11.085
[Steph giggling]

1102
01:00:11.216 --> 01:00:12.130
Shit!

1103
01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.872
My vest. it's on the landing.

1104
01:00:15.002 --> 01:00:18.440
[tense music continues]

1105
01:00:21.008 --> 01:00:24.011
- And if you follow
me up the stairs.

1106
01:00:28.886 --> 01:00:31.149
To the right is
the master bedroom.

1107
01:00:31.279 --> 01:00:33.630
And what about through here?

1108
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.631
Steph.

1109
01:00:36.371 --> 01:00:38.896
- [Steph] Oh. two
bathrooms is it?

1110
01:00:39.026 --> 01:00:40.898
- You really need to
work on dirty talk.

1111
01:00:41.028 --> 01:00:42.334
I've had no complaints yet.

1112
01:00:45.685 --> 01:00:48.688
Now go make yourself
pretty for me.

1113
01:00:48.819 --> 01:00:50.298
I just wanna have a nose around.

1114
01:00:51.299 --> 01:00:52.344
Yes ma'am.

1115
01:00:55.042 --> 01:00:58.306
[tense music continues]

1116
01:00:59.786 --> 01:01:02.920
- There's so many
rooms in this place.

1117
01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:05.183
Hard to imagine that
just one guy lived here.

1118
01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:14.932
It's a bit fancy for a
bachelor pad. don't you think?

1119
01:01:15.062 --> 01:01:15.976
What did he do?

1120
01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:21.068
[tense music continues]

1121
01:01:36.127 --> 01:01:38.433
Ethan. did you hear me?

1122
01:01:38.564 --> 01:01:39.957
Ethan!

1123
01:01:48.095 --> 01:01:50.097
Ethan. you didn't
leave. did you?

1124
01:01:52.056 --> 01:01:53.057
Ethan?

1125
01:01:57.322 --> 01:02:00.717
[tense music continues]

1126
01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:07.724
Ethan?

1127
01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:11.118
This isn't funny.

1128
01:02:13.077 --> 01:02:14.426
Ethan.

1129
01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:26.133
Well. you didn't waste any time.

1130
01:02:27.613 --> 01:02:28.875
Time's money. darling.

1131
01:02:37.449 --> 01:02:38.624
Well. in that case...

1132
01:02:40.104 --> 01:02:43.281
[tense music continues]

1133
01:02:55.467 --> 01:02:57.121
Oh. you like that.

1134
01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:07.305
Nothing turns me on
more than a scared

1135
01:03:07.435 --> 01:03:09.176
little estate agent.

1136
01:03:10.177 --> 01:03:12.049
- [Ethan] I'm not a scared
little estate agent.

1137
01:03:12.179 --> 01:03:13.180
It's okay.

1138
01:03:22.973 --> 01:03:25.584
[Steph moaning]

1139
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:35.899
[phone buzzing]

1140
01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:37.596
What? [gasping]

1141
01:03:37.726 --> 01:03:38.902
Leave it. Ethan.

1142
01:03:39.032 --> 01:03:39.772
I can't.

1143
01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:41.382
I'm technically working.

1144
01:03:41.513 --> 01:03:43.036
Hello?
[Steph scoffing]

1145
01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:44.037
Hello?

1146
01:03:44.168 --> 01:03:45.299
Shh.

1147
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:46.866
What. right now?

1148
01:03:47.736 --> 01:03:49.521
Why can't Matilda do it?

1149
01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:52.524
[tense music]

1150
01:03:52.654 --> 01:03:54.569
Just tell them I'm on my way.

1151
01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.093
You're gonna have
to get dressed.

1152
01:03:56.223 --> 01:03:57.442
Matilda didn't turn
up for work today

1153
01:03:57.572 --> 01:03:59.836
so I have to cover her viewing.

1154
01:03:59.966 --> 01:04:01.533
What. the new girl?

1155
01:04:01.663 --> 01:04:03.535
She's not gonna last long.

1156
01:04:03.665 --> 01:04:06.103
- [Ethan] Seriously.
we have to go.

1157
01:04:06.233 --> 01:04:07.365
- Bastard.
- Blame the boss man.

1158
01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:08.888
- [Steph] Well you
can tell the boss

1159
01:04:09.019 --> 01:04:10.585
I'm very sexually frustrated.

1160
01:04:12.326 --> 01:04:14.938
[tense music]

1161
01:04:21.248 --> 01:04:22.249
[Ethan] Stephanie. come on.

1162
01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.077
Hang on.

1163
01:04:24.208 --> 01:04:26.601
[tense music]

1164
01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:46.970
Coming.

1165
01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.584
[door slamming]

1166
01:04:52.714 --> 01:04:53.324
What the hell was that!

1167
01:04:53.454 --> 01:04:54.586
- I don't know-

1168
01:04:54.716 --> 01:04:55.282
- Did you know they
were coming here?

1169
01:04:55.413 --> 01:04:56.501
No. I swear!

1170
01:04:56.631 --> 01:04:57.763
- And how the fuck
did they get in?

1171
01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.286
- There's more than
one copy of the key.

1172
01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:01.158
- Oh. oh. oh. you didn't
think to mention that earlier?

1173
01:05:01.288 --> 01:05:02.028
Lena!

1174
01:05:02.159 --> 01:05:02.899
Enough.

1175
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:04.422
How was she supposed to-

1176
01:05:04.552 --> 01:05:05.249
- And you. why the fuck
didn't you secure the locks

1177
01:05:05.379 --> 01:05:06.424
from the inside. huuh?

1178
01:05:06.554 --> 01:05:07.251
- I could say the
same thing to you!

1179
01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:08.861
You son of a bitch!

1180
01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:10.558
- Look. there's no point in
the blame game right now.

1181
01:05:10.689 --> 01:05:12.169
The most important
thing is that we get out

1182
01:05:12.299 --> 01:05:13.387
of this house. okay?

1183
01:05:15.085 --> 01:05:17.348
It's time to make the call.

1184
01:05:17.478 --> 01:05:20.133
[tense music]

1185
01:05:31.971 --> 01:05:34.191
- We should take
care of her. Jack.

1186
01:05:34.321 --> 01:05:35.366
Deal with her after.

1187
01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:38.238
We can't keep the
Connect waiting.

1188
01:05:44.418 --> 01:05:45.332
It's time?

1189
01:05:47.813 --> 01:05:49.336
Yeah. it's time.

1190
01:05:55.081 --> 01:05:57.475
[tense music]

1191
01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.568
[safe whirring]

1192
01:06:05.613 --> 01:06:06.484
Make the call.

1193
01:06:09.095 --> 01:06:10.096
Right.

1194
01:06:10.227 --> 01:06:11.228
You stay put.

1195
01:06:11.358 --> 01:06:12.359
Don't move a muscle.

1196
01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.364
[tense music continues]

1197
01:06:28.854 --> 01:06:31.465
[phone buzzing]

1198
01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:38.429
Has the safe reset?

1199
01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:39.386
Yes sir.

1200
01:06:42.172 --> 01:06:42.999
Good.

1201
01:06:43.782 --> 01:06:46.132
Do you have the key?

1202
01:06:46.263 --> 01:06:48.265
Yeah. its in my hand.

1203
01:06:48.395 --> 01:06:50.093
- Right. well. let's
keep it there this time.

1204
01:06:50.223 --> 01:06:53.313
until the codes are put in.

1205
01:06:53.444 --> 01:06:54.662
Ready?

1206
01:06:54.793 --> 01:06:56.273
Ready.

1207
01:06:56.403 --> 01:06:57.404
Don't fuck it up.

1208
01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:01.408
Input the code.

1209
01:07:05.978 --> 01:07:07.153
And the code was?

1210
01:07:08.285 --> 01:07:14.378
1979113.

1211
01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:22.255
[tense music continues]

1212
01:07:22.386 --> 01:07:24.301
[safe whirring]

1213
01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:25.954
That sounds promising.

1214
01:07:27.652 --> 01:07:31.047
[tense music continues]

1215
01:07:35.442 --> 01:07:37.357
- That's one hell
of a pension fund.

1216
01:07:37.488 --> 01:07:39.229
Is the recording device there?

1217
01:07:44.495 --> 01:07:45.626
Yeah. it's here.

1218
01:07:48.455 --> 01:07:49.500
Thank fuck for that.

1219
01:07:50.457 --> 01:07:52.938
- Do you want the memory
card or the whole device?

1220
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.505
Er. er. both!

1221
01:07:57.638 --> 01:07:59.162
Is there anything else there?

1222
01:08:00.772 --> 01:08:02.078
No. just the recording.

1223
01:08:03.775 --> 01:08:05.298
And the girl?

1224
01:08:05.429 --> 01:08:06.212
Already dead.

1225
01:08:12.262 --> 01:08:14.481
- The car will collect
you in 20 minutes.

1226
01:08:18.224 --> 01:08:21.488
[tense music continues]

1227
01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.496
How much is there?

1228
01:08:30.889 --> 01:08:34.371
[tense music continues]

1229
01:08:38.549 --> 01:08:43.031
Right. I think we all
know what's coming next.

1230
01:08:43.162 --> 01:08:44.207
Lena!

1231
01:08:44.337 --> 01:08:45.773
We don't. we don't
have to do this.

1232
01:08:47.079 --> 01:08:47.906
Lena!

1233
01:08:51.518 --> 01:08:52.345
Lena!

1234
01:08:55.783 --> 01:08:56.828
[gun firing]

1235
01:08:56.958 --> 01:08:59.787
[Matilda gasping]

1236
01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:04.575
Why did you do that?

1237
01:09:07.969 --> 01:09:10.320
- He's been off his game
for a while and to be honest

1238
01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:12.452
all his guilt shit was
really starting to annoy me.

1239
01:09:12.583 --> 01:09:13.497
What. so you just killed him?

1240
01:09:13.627 --> 01:09:14.672
Yeah. he ran out of use.

1241
01:09:14.802 --> 01:09:17.065
You. on the other hand.

1242
01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:19.590
you still have a little
bit of value left in you.

1243
01:09:22.941 --> 01:09:24.464
Now put the money in the bag.

1244
01:09:26.118 --> 01:09:27.163
There's a good girl.

1245
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:32.603
[tense music continues]

1246
01:09:34.953 --> 01:09:35.780
Hurry up!

1247
01:09:45.224 --> 01:09:46.617
Is that all of it?

1248
01:09:47.574 --> 01:09:48.532
Yeah.

1249
01:09:49.794 --> 01:09:50.795
And the recording.

1250
01:10:01.936 --> 01:10:03.068
Excellent.

1251
01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:05.984
Now slide the bag behind you.

1252
01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.815
[tense music]

1253
01:10:10.945 --> 01:10:12.773
Slide the fucking bag.

1254
01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:18.866
Oh Christ. turn around.

1255
01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:22.261
I don't want to.

1256
01:10:25.612 --> 01:10:26.570
Do it!

1257
01:10:28.006 --> 01:10:31.139
[tense music continues]

1258
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:32.097
No.

1259
01:10:35.056 --> 01:10:36.362
Do it!

1260
01:10:36.493 --> 01:10:37.450
Fuck you. Lena!

1261
01:10:37.581 --> 01:10:38.625
[Lena grunting]

1262
01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:41.585
[high pitch
frequency resonating]

1263
01:10:41.715 --> 01:10:45.153
[electricity crackling]

1264
01:10:46.546 --> 01:10:47.330
Fuck!

1265
01:10:49.723 --> 01:10:52.683
[dramatic music]

1266
01:11:09.787 --> 01:11:16.010
Well. kitten. that was
extremely unnecessary.

1267
01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:21.059
You know. I really didn't
think you had it in you.

1268
01:11:21.929 --> 01:11:25.063
I was gonna make this
painless. but now.

1269
01:11:25.193 --> 01:11:27.718
let's just say this all
feels very familiar to me.

1270
01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:36.814
You know that's the exact spot

1271
01:11:36.944 --> 01:11:39.686
where your little buddy
Jack bured that guy alive.

1272
01:11:41.732 --> 01:11:42.733
I doubt that.

1273
01:11:44.822 --> 01:11:46.606
Seems more your style.

1274
01:11:46.737 --> 01:11:48.565
Well. true. but in
this particular case

1275
01:11:48.695 --> 01:11:50.871
I can't take all the credit.

1276
01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:53.874
You're saying Jack killed him?

1277
01:11:54.962 --> 01:11:55.789
Bravo.

1278
01:11:58.749 --> 01:12:01.665
If you must know. the
Connect lost patience.

1279
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:04.929
He wanted Tom to be an
example to anyone else

1280
01:12:05.059 --> 01:12:06.670
who tried to double cross him.

1281
01:12:18.943 --> 01:12:21.728
[Tom grunting]

1282
01:12:27.821 --> 01:12:31.869
- [Tom] I just told
you. I misplaced it.

1283
01:12:31.999 --> 01:12:33.523
It's unfortunate. but it's true.

1284
01:12:33.653 --> 01:12:35.612
- Always with the
smart comments. Tom.

1285
01:12:36.526 --> 01:12:37.527
Look where that's got you.

1286
01:12:37.657 --> 01:12:38.745
What. sat in my house?

1287
01:12:38.876 --> 01:12:40.704
Oh. fuck me. you're annoying.

1288
01:12:41.618 --> 01:12:42.401
Ahh.

1289
01:12:44.142 --> 01:12:44.969
Ahh.

1290
01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:49.147
She hits harder than
you. just saying.

1291
01:12:49.277 --> 01:12:50.670
Really?

1292
01:12:50.801 --> 01:12:53.499
Stop lying to us where the
safe is. you little shit.

1293
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:54.674
Oh.

1294
01:12:54.805 --> 01:12:55.806
That the best you got?

1295
01:12:57.068 --> 01:12:58.678
Do you know what. I never
thought I'd say this.

1296
01:12:58.809 --> 01:13:00.811
but you're getting
a little bit soft.

1297
01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:04.902
[Tom grunting]

1298
01:13:11.082 --> 01:13:12.692
Hey. [whistling]

1299
01:13:12.823 --> 01:13:13.737
Okay. listen to me.

1300
01:13:13.867 --> 01:13:14.781
Mm.

1301
01:13:14.912 --> 01:13:16.261
We've already got the code.

1302
01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:18.698
It's a matter of time
before we get the rest.

1303
01:13:19.786 --> 01:13:21.701
If you cooperate with us.

1304
01:13:22.528 --> 01:13:24.704
we will have a think about
letting you walk out of here.

1305
01:13:24.835 --> 01:13:27.620
[Tom laughing]

1306
01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:29.143
Now who's lying?

1307
01:13:30.014 --> 01:13:32.190
- I mean. walks
a bit optimistic.

1308
01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.670
You might manage a crawl.

1309
01:13:34.627 --> 01:13:36.281
Were you born broken Lena.

1310
01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.849
or were you just
dropped a lot as a kid?

1311
01:13:40.285 --> 01:13:42.679
[Tom screaming]

1312
01:13:42.809 --> 01:13:43.897
Fuck!

1313
01:13:44.898 --> 01:13:47.684
- Any more wise cracks before
I do the other knee cap?

1314
01:13:48.815 --> 01:13:50.208
Look.

1315
01:13:50.338 --> 01:13:52.297
This is not getting us anywhere.

1316
01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:53.907
- Well I told you he
wasn't gonna talk.

1317
01:13:54.038 --> 01:13:55.648
- He will talk. I just need a-

1318
01:13:55.779 --> 01:13:58.129
No. we haven't got time.

1319
01:13:58.259 --> 01:14:00.131
I'm gonna call the Connect.

1320
01:14:00.261 --> 01:14:02.873
[tense music]

1321
01:14:07.834 --> 01:14:08.705
Tom.

1322
01:14:12.752 --> 01:14:14.406
Tell us where the recording is.

1323
01:14:14.537 --> 01:14:15.581
It's in my safe.

1324
01:14:15.712 --> 01:14:16.626
- Yes. and where's
the fucking safe?

1325
01:14:16.756 --> 01:14:18.279
I fucking forgot.

1326
01:14:26.679 --> 01:14:29.769
- You know he's gonna make
us kill you otherwise.

1327
01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.771
- He's gonna make
you kill me anyway.

1328
01:14:32.816 --> 01:14:34.034
You know how this goes.

1329
01:14:34.165 --> 01:14:36.123
- Maybe you shouldn't
have fucking snitched.

1330
01:14:36.254 --> 01:14:37.647
Oh.

1331
01:14:37.777 --> 01:14:40.693
- I mean. come on an
informant. how stupid is that?

1332
01:14:40.824 --> 01:14:43.827
- You don't know
anything about him.

1333
01:14:48.919 --> 01:14:51.617
The stuff we're tangled up with.

1334
01:14:55.926 --> 01:14:58.798
None of us are getting
out of this alive.

1335
01:14:58.929 --> 01:15:00.321
That's bullshit.

1336
01:15:01.148 --> 01:15:04.238
We're just all loose
ends. all of us.

1337
01:15:05.936 --> 01:15:07.938
You and Lena included.

1338
01:15:09.592 --> 01:15:11.811
I'm gonna take my chances.

1339
01:15:11.942 --> 01:15:14.988
My odds can't be any worse
than yours right now.

1340
01:15:15.119 --> 01:15:20.124
- [chuckling] Well. I
can't argue with that.

1341
01:15:21.212 --> 01:15:22.561
I'm just tired.

1342
01:15:25.956 --> 01:15:28.959
tired of being
disgusted with myself.

1343
01:15:32.049 --> 01:15:35.748
The money aint worth
the fallout. you know?

1344
01:15:40.013 --> 01:15:43.234
I reckon you're
pretty tired too. pal.

1345
01:15:48.369 --> 01:15:52.373
- I'm not gonna take on
a fight that I can't win.

1346
01:15:52.504 --> 01:15:55.942
[footsteps thudding]

1347
01:15:56.073 --> 01:15:57.988
Lena. what did he say?

1348
01:15:58.989 --> 01:16:00.773
What the fuck are you doing?

1349
01:16:00.904 --> 01:16:01.861
What the fuck you doing!

1350
01:16:01.992 --> 01:16:03.820
[Jack] Lena?

1351
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:04.951
- Fuck.
- Lena?

1352
01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:08.476
What are you doing?

1353
01:16:08.607 --> 01:16:10.435
What I've been told.

1354
01:16:11.958 --> 01:16:14.178
[tense music]

1355
01:16:14.308 --> 01:16:16.136
Lena. we don't have to do this.

1356
01:16:16.267 --> 01:16:17.442
Lena.

1357
01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:20.880
[hammer thudding]

1358
01:16:21.011 --> 01:16:23.491
[tense music]

1359
01:16:26.016 --> 01:16:28.845
[Tom screaming]

1360
01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.588
I can't see. fucked up my eye.

1361
01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:38.550
- [Lena] Just to let you
know. I'm gonna enjoy this.

1362
01:16:38.681 --> 01:16:43.686
- [Tom] Fuck you.
Lena! [grunting]

1363
01:16:44.251 --> 01:16:46.253
You're fine. okay?

1364
01:16:46.384 --> 01:16:49.300
We have got to
finish this. okay?

1365
01:16:51.563 --> 01:16:54.044
The connect wants you to do it.

1366
01:16:56.002 --> 01:16:57.047
What?

1367
01:16:57.177 --> 01:16:58.570
Those were his instructions.

1368
01:16:58.701 --> 01:17:01.007
he said it's got to be you.

1369
01:17:02.052 --> 01:17:04.054
Why does it have to be me?

1370
01:17:04.184 --> 01:17:05.490
I don't know.

1371
01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.623
Test of loyalty I guess.

1372
01:17:08.798 --> 01:17:11.583
[tense music]

1373
01:17:11.714 --> 01:17:12.540
Fuck!

1374
01:17:13.411 --> 01:17:16.066
[Tom grunting]

1375
01:17:26.424 --> 01:17:29.340
[lighter flicking]

1376
01:17:36.173 --> 01:17:39.611
[tense music continues]

1377
01:17:44.616 --> 01:17:48.228
Jack. it's either him or us.

1378
01:17:49.142 --> 01:17:51.841
and it's not gonna
be fucking us!

1379
01:17:54.365 --> 01:17:57.760
[tense music continues]

1380
01:18:21.261 --> 01:18:22.741
[Tom] Jack!

1381
01:18:22.872 --> 01:18:25.309
Please. don't do this.

1382
01:18:26.179 --> 01:18:27.093
Come on. mate.

1383
01:18:27.224 --> 01:18:28.791
Please. no!

1384
01:18:29.182 --> 01:18:33.752
No! [screaming]

1385
01:18:34.927 --> 01:18:38.539
[dramatic orchestral music]

1386
01:18:56.514 --> 01:18:58.734
You enjoy it. don't you?

1387
01:19:00.474 --> 01:19:02.999
Killing innocent people.

1388
01:19:03.129 --> 01:19:05.523
- Oh. you think the guy
we killed was innocent?

1389
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:07.220
That's cute.

1390
01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:09.919
No.

1391
01:19:10.049 --> 01:19:13.096
No. he used to do
exactly the same as us.

1392
01:19:13.226 --> 01:19:15.228
But when our methods
got a little bit more.

1393
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:19.102
lets say for the sake
of argument. extreme.

1394
01:19:19.232 --> 01:19:20.016
he wanted out.

1395
01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.196
It's gonna be excruciating.

1396
01:19:28.285 --> 01:19:30.722
I've got to be honest.
Tom squealed like a pig.

1397
01:19:32.158 --> 01:19:32.942
Embarrassing.

1398
01:19:34.247 --> 01:19:36.467
[Matilda gasping]

1399
01:19:36.597 --> 01:19:37.294
Please stop.

1400
01:19:37.424 --> 01:19:38.774
No. don't.

1401
01:19:38.904 --> 01:19:41.733
- Funnily enough that
is exactly what he said.

1402
01:19:43.082 --> 01:19:44.257
You're a psychopath.

1403
01:19:45.084 --> 01:19:46.129
Thank you.

1404
01:19:46.259 --> 01:19:47.695
I take that as a compliment.

1405
01:19:52.396 --> 01:19:55.225
Oh. I would say. it's
been nice knowing you.

1406
01:19:55.355 --> 01:19:56.748
but that would be a lie.

1407
01:19:56.879 --> 01:19:58.619
Oh. it probably
goes without saying.

1408
01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:01.797
but I'm afraid it's gonna
be a no on the house.

1409
01:20:03.276 --> 01:20:05.539
[Matilda gasping]

1410
01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:06.453
- [lighter clicking]
- Shit.

1411
01:20:06.584 --> 01:20:07.411
Oh my God.

1412
01:20:09.892 --> 01:20:13.286
[tense music continues]

1413
01:20:16.899 --> 01:20:18.857
Oh my God. fuck!

1414
01:20:18.988 --> 01:20:22.295
[tense music continues]

1415
01:20:24.776 --> 01:20:27.474
[Lena screaming]

1416
01:20:28.693 --> 01:20:31.391
[dramatic music]

1417
01:20:50.236 --> 01:20:52.412
You fucking lied to me!

1418
01:20:52.543 --> 01:20:54.588
- That wasn't the
response I was expecting.

1419
01:20:54.719 --> 01:20:56.329
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1420
01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:59.332
A simple thank
you would suffice.

1421
01:21:02.553 --> 01:21:05.034
You're the one who killed him.

1422
01:21:05.164 --> 01:21:06.949
It was you. wasn't it?

1423
01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.778
[dramatic music]

1424
01:21:12.345 --> 01:21:14.217
It's complicated.

1425
01:21:14.347 --> 01:21:16.349
You wouldn't understand.

1426
01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:18.743
Try me.

1427
01:21:20.701 --> 01:21:23.356
[Jack coughing]

1428
01:21:24.618 --> 01:21:27.883
The guy we work
for. the connect.

1429
01:21:29.406 --> 01:21:30.973
he doesn't fuck about.

1430
01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:35.368
So we do the job. and
we take the money.

1431
01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:40.504
Sometimes people die.

1432
01:21:43.376 --> 01:21:47.815
It's unfortunate. but
it's part of the process.

1433
01:21:47.946 --> 01:21:52.429
- God. people don't just die.
alright you talk about it

1434
01:21:52.559 --> 01:21:53.430
like it's out of your control.

1435
01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.172
but you're the one who did it!

1436
01:21:57.738 --> 01:21:59.392
You chose to kill Tom.

1437
01:22:02.352 --> 01:22:05.398
- That was different.
he was different.

1438
01:22:11.404 --> 01:22:16.409
I'm not proud of
any of that shit.

1439
01:22:19.412 --> 01:22:20.848
Then why do it?

1440
01:22:22.676 --> 01:22:24.765
I didn't have a choice.

1441
01:22:26.593 --> 01:22:28.291
Never have.

1442
01:22:28.421 --> 01:22:30.293
That's not really true. is it?

1443
01:22:33.426 --> 01:22:34.471
You don't know me.

1444
01:22:36.429 --> 01:22:37.430
You saved me.

1445
01:22:38.866 --> 01:22:39.693
Why?

1446
01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:49.181
I had a code. once.

1447
01:22:50.443 --> 01:22:53.011
I didn't want to see
another innocent woman die.

1448
01:22:53.142 --> 01:22:55.709
- Oh. fucking hell.
that's noble of you.

1449
01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.624
Has it never crossed your mind
that for every man you kill.

1450
01:22:57.755 --> 01:22:59.713
there's a wife at home?

1451
01:22:59.844 --> 01:23:02.238
A mother. a sister. a kid
who's life you just destroy

1452
01:23:02.368 --> 01:23:03.891
at the same time?

1453
01:23:06.285 --> 01:23:07.939
What do you want from me?

1454
01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:11.987
Do you want to save me?

1455
01:23:13.597 --> 01:23:16.513
- No. I don't really think
there's any saving you.

1456
01:23:16.643 --> 01:23:17.470
Hmm.

1457
01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:23.346
- I don't even think
you're an evil guy. Jack.

1458
01:23:23.476 --> 01:23:26.131
I just don't get what
makes you do this.

1459
01:23:26.262 --> 01:23:27.611
Survival.

1460
01:23:29.047 --> 01:23:31.484
- There's ways to survive
without killing people.

1461
01:23:34.487 --> 01:23:38.230
[dramatic music continues]

1462
01:23:42.669 --> 01:23:45.237
Matilda. wh...

1463
01:23:45.368 --> 01:23:47.631
Where you going?

1464
01:23:47.761 --> 01:23:48.762
Time to go.

1465
01:23:48.893 --> 01:23:49.720
No.

1466
01:23:51.504 --> 01:23:53.550
No. you need to stay.

1467
01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:56.074
Matilda. patch me up.

1468
01:23:56.205 --> 01:23:58.903
- What do you think I'm
gonna be able to do. Jack?

1469
01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.470
You've lost a lot of blood.

1470
01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.385
I'll be fine.

1471
01:24:02.515 --> 01:24:03.516
You need a doctor.

1472
01:24:04.517 --> 01:24:05.736
I'll tell the police
to bring an ambulance.

1473
01:24:05.866 --> 01:24:06.824
No police!

1474
01:24:08.478 --> 01:24:09.348
No police.

1475
01:24:10.784 --> 01:24:12.134
I can't go back to prison.

1476
01:24:13.526 --> 01:24:15.572
You don't know what
it's like in there.

1477
01:24:15.702 --> 01:24:17.530
I can't do it.

1478
01:24:17.661 --> 01:24:19.054
Please Matilda.

1479
01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:21.317
Please.

1480
01:24:23.841 --> 01:24:27.540
[dramatic music continues]

1481
01:24:43.252 --> 01:24:47.212
- I'm sorry you were
never given a choice.

1482
01:24:47.343 --> 01:24:48.648
Now you have one.

1483
01:24:57.657 --> 01:24:58.571
Matilda.

1484
01:25:05.578 --> 01:25:07.276
For what it's worth.

1485
01:25:08.842 --> 01:25:11.584
I'm well aware of
what I've done.

1486
01:25:13.891 --> 01:25:16.023
all the people I've hurt.

1487
01:25:19.853 --> 01:25:21.290
No you're not.

1488
01:25:24.597 --> 01:25:28.253
[dramatic music continues]

1489
01:25:36.174 --> 01:25:38.611
[gun firing]

1490
01:25:46.619 --> 01:25:50.188
[dramatic orchestral music]

1491
01:25:55.411 --> 01:25:58.065
- [Charlie] I wasn't sure
you'd still be alive.

1492
01:26:00.111 --> 01:26:01.112
Is it done?

1493
01:26:01.243 --> 01:26:02.069
It's done.

1494
01:26:03.636 --> 01:26:04.637
[Charlie] Good.

1495
01:26:05.682 --> 01:26:08.032
Jordan is outside. he
will bring you to me.

1496
01:26:09.599 --> 01:26:13.168
[dramatic orchestral music]

1497
01:26:25.919 --> 01:26:27.921
Well. Isn't this cozy?

1498
01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:35.277
Where is he?

1499
01:26:36.887 --> 01:26:38.715
[hand knocking on window]

1500
01:26:38.845 --> 01:26:41.674
[engine revving]

1501
01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:52.685
[door clicking]
[tense music]

1502
01:27:11.530 --> 01:27:12.183
Charlie.

1503
01:27:12.314 --> 01:27:14.751
Matilda.

1504
01:27:16.013 --> 01:27:18.363
Do you have it?

1505
01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:24.761
Ahh.

1506
01:27:25.936 --> 01:27:27.590
Do you want to
know what's on it?

1507
01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.722
- I want to know you're keeping
your end of the bargain.

1508
01:27:29.853 --> 01:27:30.984
I gave you my word.

1509
01:27:31.115 --> 01:27:32.159
- Your word didn't
seem to count for much

1510
01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:33.422
when it all went
tits up in there.

1511
01:27:33.552 --> 01:27:34.814
I did what I could.

1512
01:27:35.772 --> 01:27:38.209
I never said I would
compromise my plan for you.

1513
01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:43.649
Things get complicated.
but you were smart.

1514
01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:45.564
You held your nerve.

1515
01:27:45.695 --> 01:27:47.131
- Yeah well. it was
pretty touch and go.

1516
01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:48.567
- Well. it doesn't really
matter now does it.

1517
01:27:48.698 --> 01:27:50.047
you got the job done.

1518
01:27:51.527 --> 01:27:54.312
I can't tell you how much
I respect you for that.

1519
01:27:55.879 --> 01:27:58.621
Oh. I never complete
handovers myself.

1520
01:27:59.665 --> 01:28:01.101
What does that tell you?

1521
01:28:01.232 --> 01:28:03.800
- That everyone else who
works for you is already dead?

1522
01:28:05.367 --> 01:28:07.717
- Matilda darling. this is
going to be very lucrative

1523
01:28:07.847 --> 01:28:09.022
for all of us.

1524
01:28:09.153 --> 01:28:12.417
My press conference
was a great success.

1525
01:28:12.548 --> 01:28:14.680
my competition is quite
literally up in smoke.

1526
01:28:14.811 --> 01:28:16.726
We are head of the table.

1527
01:28:17.814 --> 01:28:19.946
Once we go to market.
fertility problems

1528
01:28:20.077 --> 01:28:23.254
will be a thing of the
past. for some people.

1529
01:28:23.385 --> 01:28:25.691
- Oh. you mean the
ones who can afford it?

1530
01:28:25.822 --> 01:28:28.172
- Well. let's not
avoid the wider issue.

1531
01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:30.435
Birth rates have been
plummeting in decent countries

1532
01:28:30.566 --> 01:28:32.263
since the 1960s.

1533
01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:35.745
We are on the cusp
of an aging crisis.

1534
01:28:35.875 --> 01:28:39.401
The economic ramifications
of that are huge.

1535
01:28:39.531 --> 01:28:41.968
Now. there's been a
very competitive race

1536
01:28:42.099 --> 01:28:44.319
to finish the formula.

1537
01:28:44.449 --> 01:28:46.712
Some other companies
that don't have my. er.

1538
01:28:46.843 --> 01:28:49.062
shall we say. foresight.

1539
01:28:49.193 --> 01:28:51.717
They'd make these treatments
readily available.

1540
01:28:51.848 --> 01:28:53.371
And I can't have that.

1541
01:28:54.372 --> 01:28:55.765
Oh. of course.

1542
01:28:55.895 --> 01:28:57.854
I mean we can't let the
poor procreate. now can we?

1543
01:28:58.985 --> 01:29:00.030
[Charlie] Exactly.

1544
01:29:01.118 --> 01:29:02.032
I was being sarcastic.

1545
01:29:02.162 --> 01:29:03.599
Why not?

1546
01:29:03.729 --> 01:29:06.732
Imagine eradicating
infertility and poverty

1547
01:29:06.863 --> 01:29:08.778
at the same time.

1548
01:29:10.127 --> 01:29:11.215
- Yeah but I mean.
obviously you can't gamble

1549
01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:12.347
with that kind of profit?

1550
01:29:12.477 --> 01:29:14.610
But it's not about the money.

1551
01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:16.133
It's about creating a future

1552
01:29:16.263 --> 01:29:18.875
that won't collapse
in on itself.

1553
01:29:21.834 --> 01:29:22.835
I understand.

1554
01:29:22.966 --> 01:29:24.141
Good.

1555
01:29:24.271 --> 01:29:27.362
And if we have to
crack a few eggs...

1556
01:29:30.887 --> 01:29:31.888
The recording.

1557
01:29:37.894 --> 01:29:40.070
- You're gonna need a
micro card reader for that.

1558
01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:42.202
Yeah.

1559
01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.728
I know.

1560
01:29:45.858 --> 01:29:48.078
- Jack and Lena have
been dealt with.

1561
01:29:48.208 --> 01:29:50.950
Police will happily charge
them with the fires.

1562
01:29:52.561 --> 01:29:56.913
which means that you
are my only loose end.

1563
01:29:58.828 --> 01:30:00.656
I'm trusting you.

1564
01:30:00.786 --> 01:30:03.702
Do the right thing and you
will receive regular payments

1565
01:30:03.833 --> 01:30:04.921
when we go to market.

1566
01:30:06.879 --> 01:30:08.446
- And Matilda-
- I know.

1567
01:30:10.927 --> 01:30:12.711
Our relationship doesn't exist.

1568
01:30:14.844 --> 01:30:15.975
Oh you are great.

1569
01:30:16.889 --> 01:30:18.804
A real find.

1570
01:30:18.935 --> 01:30:20.327
You didn't fuck anything up.

1571
01:30:21.807 --> 01:30:25.115
But if you do. you'll
wish that you'd died

1572
01:30:25.245 --> 01:30:26.333
in that house too.

1573
01:30:28.684 --> 01:30:30.468
It's been a pleasure
not knowing you.

1574
01:30:31.643 --> 01:30:32.427
Likewise.

1575
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:42.262
So. what do I do now?

1576
01:30:42.393 --> 01:30:45.309
- [Charlie] From here you
pick up the original plan.

1577
01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.659
Call the police.
play the victim.

1578
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:48.878
recite the speech I gave you

1579
01:30:49.008 --> 01:30:50.967
about what you
overheard between them.

1580
01:30:51.968 --> 01:30:53.839
Case closed. police wise.

1581
01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:56.276
You. or should I say we.
will be home and dry.

1582
01:30:56.407 --> 01:30:57.190
Hello?

1583
01:30:57.321 --> 01:30:58.365
Yep. I need police please.

1584
01:31:01.325 --> 01:31:03.980
[tense music]

1585
01:31:25.392 --> 01:31:27.307
Matilda Watson is dead.

1586
01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:31.747
In fact she's been dead
for over eight years.

1587
01:31:33.052 --> 01:31:36.360
So. as someone who
doesn't believe in ghosts.

1588
01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:38.971
let's get the most obvious
question out the way.

1589
01:31:41.147 --> 01:31:42.192
Who exactly are you?

1590
01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:45.891
[tense music]

1591
01:31:46.022 --> 01:31:46.892
[hand knocking on door]

1592
01:31:47.023 --> 01:31:48.024
Emily.

1593
01:32:00.079 --> 01:32:01.516
Sorry. I got held up.

1594
01:32:01.646 --> 01:32:02.821
Oh. there's a surprise.

1595
01:32:03.779 --> 01:32:04.519
Ah.

1596
01:32:04.649 --> 01:32:06.477
[both laughing]

1597
01:32:06.608 --> 01:32:08.566
- So how's the
house coming along?

1598
01:32:09.828 --> 01:32:11.917
- Well. I've kind of
actually put it on ice.

1599
01:32:13.049 --> 01:32:14.790
What?

1600
01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.052
Thinking about moving out.

1601
01:32:16.182 --> 01:32:18.228
You've only just moved in.

1602
01:32:18.358 --> 01:32:19.751
Yeah. I know.

1603
01:32:19.882 --> 01:32:21.927
I'm just gonna. I don't
know. lay low for a while.

1604
01:32:22.058 --> 01:32:23.973
I'm thinking Amsterdam.

1605
01:32:26.018 --> 01:32:27.237
Why?

1606
01:32:27.367 --> 01:32:30.675
- Well. canals. er.
cycling. architecture.

1607
01:32:30.806 --> 01:32:31.937
This isn't funny. Tom.

1608
01:32:32.068 --> 01:32:33.591
What have you done now?

1609
01:32:36.725 --> 01:32:39.336
- I need you to get me some
information on these guys.

1610
01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:44.559
[dramatic music]

1611
01:32:48.258 --> 01:32:49.955
- Well you know there's a
thing called Google. right?

1612
01:32:50.086 --> 01:32:51.000
- What's the point of
having a tech wizard

1613
01:32:51.130 --> 01:32:52.436
for a sister if you can't-

1614
01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:54.873
- I can't access
personal files like this.

1615
01:32:55.004 --> 01:32:55.787
Yes you can.

1616
01:32:59.312 --> 01:33:00.139
Not legally.

1617
01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:02.664
What's it for anyway?

1618
01:33:07.277 --> 01:33:10.585
Oh god. you're not still
working for that guy?

1619
01:33:10.715 --> 01:33:12.935
No. yes.

1620
01:33:13.283 --> 01:33:14.197
I mean. it's complicated.

1621
01:33:14.327 --> 01:33:16.025
For God sake. Tom.

1622
01:33:16.155 --> 01:33:18.418
You promised me you were
done with all that shit.

1623
01:33:18.549 --> 01:33:22.074
- I am. I'm just I'm
working for the other side.

1624
01:33:22.205 --> 01:33:23.293
They have no idea.

1625
01:33:23.423 --> 01:33:25.600
No. you have no idea.

1626
01:33:25.730 --> 01:33:27.776
You don't even know
who these people are.

1627
01:33:28.907 --> 01:33:32.911
- I'm doing the right
thing. like we talked about.

1628
01:33:33.956 --> 01:33:36.219
- I meant. go and
get a normal job.

1629
01:33:36.349 --> 01:33:38.525
Not attempt to become
some kind of double agent.

1630
01:33:38.656 --> 01:33:40.049
- Em-

1631
01:33:40.179 --> 01:33:43.008
- I mean I love you Tom.
but you're a fucking idiot.

1632
01:33:43.139 --> 01:33:45.097
- He's dangerous.
okay. the fires.

1633
01:33:45.228 --> 01:33:49.014
the people that have died.
it all filters down from him.

1634
01:33:49.145 --> 01:33:51.060
I am sure of it.
and if I can get him

1635
01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:52.627
this bit of information.

1636
01:33:52.757 --> 01:33:55.847
then he will trust me. and
then it means I can get out!

1637
01:34:07.163 --> 01:34:09.121
Look I'll. I'll do what I can.

1638
01:34:11.210 --> 01:34:11.994
I know you will.

1639
01:34:12.124 --> 01:34:13.038
Come here.

1640
01:34:17.173 --> 01:34:19.784
Promise me you'll be careful.

1641
01:34:22.004 --> 01:34:24.397
[tense music]

1642
01:34:28.227 --> 01:34:33.232
- Listen. if anything were
to happen to me. it won't.

1643
01:34:33.363 --> 01:34:34.190
but if it did.

1644
01:34:38.194 --> 01:34:40.805
the name on the
back. he will help.

1645
01:34:41.719 --> 01:34:42.502
What?

1646
01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:48.944
[Tom] Emily?

1647
01:34:50.032 --> 01:34:50.815
Yeah?

1648
01:34:52.208 --> 01:34:53.209
I love you too.

1649
01:35:00.216 --> 01:35:04.089
- [Gray] Let me get this
straight. you're Emily Allans?

1650
01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:05.525
Tom Allans' sister?

1651
01:35:09.442 --> 01:35:10.269
Yes.

1652
01:35:12.054 --> 01:35:13.490
You know we recruited Tom

1653
01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:16.101
as an informant when we
suspected that Charlie Knight

1654
01:35:16.232 --> 01:35:18.234
was responsible for
the arson attacks.

1655
01:35:19.626 --> 01:35:21.106
Yes.

1656
01:35:21.237 --> 01:35:23.587
- And you used your position
to access confidential data

1657
01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:25.676
on Knight's
pharmaceutical rivals

1658
01:35:25.807 --> 01:35:27.852
which you leaked
to your brother.

1659
01:35:27.983 --> 01:35:31.116
- No. I never
shared it with Tom.

1660
01:35:31.247 --> 01:35:32.901
Why not?

1661
01:35:33.031 --> 01:35:35.251
- Because he was dead
before I got the chance.

1662
01:35:38.167 --> 01:35:39.559
Strange because
he seemed to think

1663
01:35:39.690 --> 01:35:41.126
he was under your protection.

1664
01:35:41.257 --> 01:35:44.608
- Why didn't you
just bring it to us?

1665
01:35:44.739 --> 01:35:46.828
Look. Tom was a lot of things.

1666
01:35:46.958 --> 01:35:50.309
made bad decisions. reckless.
got in with the wrong crowd.

1667
01:35:51.702 --> 01:35:53.182
but I think maybe for the
first time in his life.

1668
01:35:53.312 --> 01:35:56.141
he actually believed he
was doing the right thing.

1669
01:35:56.272 --> 01:35:57.795
Being your guy on the inside

1670
01:35:57.926 --> 01:36:00.058
and helping the
good guys type shit.

1671
01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:02.147
I couldn't let that
be for nothing.

1672
01:36:06.064 --> 01:36:09.285
- You just thought you'd
pick up where he left off?

1673
01:36:10.721 --> 01:36:14.943
Take the data to Knight. or
the connect as you call him.

1674
01:36:15.073 --> 01:36:16.335
'Cause of course that's
a really sensible

1675
01:36:16.466 --> 01:36:18.076
and safe thing to do.

1676
01:36:18.207 --> 01:36:19.295
Well I wouldn't of had to

1677
01:36:19.425 --> 01:36:20.818
if you lot had done
your job better.

1678
01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:24.953
Point taken.

1679
01:36:25.867 --> 01:36:27.216
Go on.

1680
01:36:27.346 --> 01:36:28.391
- I had to make him think
he was approaching me.

1681
01:36:28.521 --> 01:36:30.349
not the other way round.

1682
01:36:31.786 --> 01:36:32.961
And?

1683
01:36:33.091 --> 01:36:34.440
- I paid one of Tom's
dodgy work friends

1684
01:36:34.571 --> 01:36:36.312
to drop into conversation
about someone he knew

1685
01:36:36.442 --> 01:36:37.356
on the dark web.

1686
01:36:38.575 --> 01:36:40.882
Someone who could access
pretty much whatever info

1687
01:36:41.012 --> 01:36:42.492
was needed for the right price.

1688
01:36:44.189 --> 01:36:45.016
Nice.

1689
01:36:46.365 --> 01:36:48.846
- That data was
just the beginning.

1690
01:36:48.977 --> 01:36:51.327
I then worked with him
remotely for months.

1691
01:36:52.110 --> 01:36:54.199
tracing online footprints
of people of interest.

1692
01:36:54.330 --> 01:36:55.374
Other rivals?

1693
01:36:55.505 --> 01:36:56.811
Not just his rivals.

1694
01:36:58.377 --> 01:36:59.770
What happened with Tom
shook the connects faith

1695
01:36:59.901 --> 01:37:01.250
in his whole team.

1696
01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:02.947
His own people?

1697
01:37:03.078 --> 01:37:03.861
Exactly.

1698
01:37:05.123 --> 01:37:06.255
I know more about Jack and Lena

1699
01:37:06.385 --> 01:37:07.734
than they could have
possibly imagined.

1700
01:37:07.865 --> 01:37:09.780
- Yeah. what was the
plan with Jack and Lena?

1701
01:37:09.911 --> 01:37:12.261
I mean surely they
knew too much.

1702
01:37:12.391 --> 01:37:13.871
I've been tracking
Knight a while.

1703
01:37:14.002 --> 01:37:16.134
he doesn't seem the
most forgiving person.

1704
01:37:17.396 --> 01:37:19.746
Well he told them he was
giving them a second chance.

1705
01:37:19.877 --> 01:37:22.184
but they'd failed to
retrieve the recording

1706
01:37:22.314 --> 01:37:23.968
from Tom once already.

1707
01:37:24.099 --> 01:37:25.404
When they retrieved
it this time.

1708
01:37:25.535 --> 01:37:27.537
a clean up crew were
coming in to take them out.

1709
01:37:28.625 --> 01:37:32.281
My role was to oversee
the operation and deliver

1710
01:37:32.411 --> 01:37:33.891
the recording to him personally.

1711
01:37:35.588 --> 01:37:36.938
What's taking so long?

1712
01:37:37.068 --> 01:37:38.330
I want to get out of here.

1713
01:37:38.461 --> 01:37:40.550
- Sorry sir. it's taking
a while to download.

1714
01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:42.247
[device beeping]

1715
01:37:42.378 --> 01:37:43.205
Finally.

1716
01:37:44.336 --> 01:37:46.251
Do you want to hear it?

1717
01:37:48.384 --> 01:37:49.385
Play it.

1718
01:37:49.515 --> 01:37:50.734
It wasn't hard to get taken on

1719
01:37:50.865 --> 01:37:52.954
by the agency
handling Tom's house.

1720
01:37:53.084 --> 01:37:54.390
So I could go in with them

1721
01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:56.479
when it went back on the market.

1722
01:37:56.609 --> 01:37:59.090
But what I didn't plan
for was Jack entering

1723
01:37:59.221 --> 01:38:00.613
the safe's code incorrectly.

1724
01:38:00.744 --> 01:38:02.354
Then I had to improvise.

1725
01:38:02.485 --> 01:38:04.313
Must have been hard for you.

1726
01:38:04.443 --> 01:38:05.880
thinking Jack and Lena were
gonna get away with it.

1727
01:38:06.010 --> 01:38:08.447
- I guess I had my sights
set higher than them.

1728
01:38:10.145 --> 01:38:12.060
It was more about
what I had to do

1729
01:38:14.453 --> 01:38:15.454
to get this.

1730
01:38:16.455 --> 01:38:19.415
[dramatic music]

1731
01:38:22.592 --> 01:38:24.811
- Tell me that's
what I think it is.

1732
01:38:24.942 --> 01:38:28.337
- Everything that happened.
it's all recorded on there.

1733
01:38:28.467 --> 01:38:31.296
Also. a realtime GPS
signal has been sent

1734
01:38:31.427 --> 01:38:32.863
to your dispatch team
with the location

1735
01:38:32.994 --> 01:38:33.908
of Charlie Knight.

1736
01:38:39.783 --> 01:38:41.785
Just. give me a minute.

[dramatic music continues]

1738
01:38:51.490 --> 01:38:54.189
- [Charlie] It was insured.
everybody was covered.

1739
01:38:54.319 --> 01:38:56.365
- [Tom] With respect
sir. Lena said you knew

1740
01:38:56.495 --> 01:38:58.671
the cleaners were
still in the building.

1741
01:38:58.802 --> 01:38:59.934
[Charlie] Yes.

1742
01:39:00.064 --> 01:39:01.283
And?

1743
01:39:01.413 --> 01:39:02.284
- [Tom] And you told
them to torch it anyway.

1744
01:39:02.414 --> 01:39:03.633
[Charlie] Yes I did.

1745
01:39:03.763 --> 01:39:05.635
what's with all the
fucking questions. Tom?

1746
01:39:05.765 --> 01:39:06.984
Most people got out.

1747
01:39:07.811 --> 01:39:09.378
- [Tom] Not the one
with the little kid.

1748
01:39:09.508 --> 01:39:12.685
- [Charlie] Fuck sake. it was
a pharmaceutical laboratory.

1749
01:39:12.816 --> 01:39:14.383
Not a kindergarten.

1750
01:39:14.513 --> 01:39:16.385
Stupid bitch shouldn't have
brought her kid to work.

1751
01:39:16.515 --> 01:39:18.996
- Sir. I-
- Enough!

1752
01:39:19.127 --> 01:39:21.825
Let me make something
very clear. Tom.

1753
01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:23.522
If you question me again-

1754
01:39:24.436 --> 01:39:25.176
Now delete it.

1755
01:39:25.307 --> 01:39:26.525
You'll be joining them.

[dramatic orchestral music]

1757
01:39:35.621 --> 01:39:36.753
Just to let you know.

1758
01:39:36.883 --> 01:39:38.624
we are moving on
this straight away.

1759
01:39:41.279 --> 01:39:43.803
I take it you've got
Tom's recording too?

1760
01:39:43.934 --> 01:39:45.544
No. I gave that to Knight.

1761
01:39:47.024 --> 01:39:48.286
Why would you do that?

1762
01:39:49.548 --> 01:39:50.897
Because I gave him my word.

1763
01:39:51.986 --> 01:39:54.379
And often if people want
something from you badly enough.

1764
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:56.251
when you give it to them.

1765
01:39:56.381 --> 01:39:57.687
they can't see anything else.

1767
01:40:08.828 --> 01:40:09.655
Wait.

1768
01:40:13.311 --> 01:40:14.573
- I said delete it.
- I'm trying.

1769
01:40:14.704 --> 01:40:16.619
What the fuck it that?

- It's transferring
to multiple locations.

It won't. it won't delete.

but it's not responding.

this didn't get buried

of the top news
editors in the country.

this case a long time

and although your
methods were not-

1791
01:41:11.630 --> 01:41:12.631
You're welcome.

01:41:14.981 --> 01:41:16.548

what you have done.

with all he was involved
with. but actually.

1797
01:41:35.654 --> 01:41:36.655
Tom was always very-

1798
01:41:38.657 --> 01:41:39.658
He was your brother.

1799
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:46.796
- So now you know I
was involved with Jack

1800
01:41:46.926 --> 01:41:48.276
and Lena's deaths.

1801
01:41:49.668 --> 01:41:50.887
will I go to prison?

1802
01:41:55.413 --> 01:41:57.372
Jack killed Lena.

1803
01:41:57.502 --> 01:41:58.373
That was his call.

1804
01:42:03.682 --> 01:42:04.683
One question.

1805
01:42:06.598 --> 01:42:08.339
Was there anything
else in the safe?

1806
01:42:09.166 --> 01:42:10.733
Paperwork?

1807
01:42:10.863 --> 01:42:12.952
Valuables?

1808
01:42:13.083 --> 01:42:16.695
Money?

1809
01:42:20.482 --> 01:42:21.265
Nothing.

1810
01:42:26.705 --> 01:42:28.359
Good enough for me.

1811
01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:29.578
You?

1812
01:42:29.708 --> 01:42:31.362
Yep.

[dramatic orchestral music]

1814
01:42:35.714 --> 01:42:37.934
So. about Jack.

1815
01:42:40.241 --> 01:42:41.503
We never found his body.

1816
01:42:44.201 --> 01:42:45.028
What?

1817
01:42:47.335 --> 01:42:48.597
No. he killed himself.

1818
01:42:48.727 --> 01:42:50.599
- I-
- You heard the gun. I know.

1819
01:42:50.729 --> 01:42:52.992
but you never saw the body.

1820
01:42:56.387 --> 01:42:57.910
Look. don't worry.

1821
01:42:58.041 --> 01:42:59.608
We will look after you.

1822
01:42:59.738 --> 01:43:02.219
We will get you out the country
until all of those involved

1823
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:03.960
are in custody.

1824
01:43:04.090 --> 01:43:05.483
Witness protection.

1825
01:43:05.614 --> 01:43:07.746
like we should have
done for your brother

1826
01:43:09.748 --> 01:43:11.750
Any idea where you want to go?
