You're all right.

Open the door!

9
00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:47.324
Come on.

10
00:01:47.324 --> 00:01:48.891

Baby!
Baby slow down. slow down.

16
00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:08.911
What happened?

17
00:02:09.912 --> 00:02:11.348
Is he gonna be okay?

18
00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:12.654
Jimmy is he gonna be okay?

19
00:02:12.784 --> 00:02:14.656
Baby you've got
to slow down. okay?

20
00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:16.092
You've got to slow down.

21
00:02:16.223 --> 00:02:17.659
Everything is gonna be fine.
but you've got to calm down.

22
00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.530
We cannot get pulled
over by the cops.

23
00:02:20.575 --> 00:02:21.532
Okay.
where do I go?

24
00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.578
- What do I do?
- Baby. listen to me.

25
00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:26.363
Listen to me. just
breathe slowly.

26
00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:27.886
What do I do?

27
00:02:27.886 --> 00:02:29.018
What do I do here?

28
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.367
Just drive for now. okay?

29
00:02:30.454 --> 00:02:31.803
Nice and easy. okay?

30
00:02:31.803 --> 00:02:33.370
Just stay on the main road.

31
00:02:33.457 --> 00:02:34.371
I knew it.

32
00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:35.372
I knew it.

33
00:02:35.372 --> 00:02:37.026
What are we gonna do if he dies?

34
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:37.983
Why did you have to do this?

35
00:02:38.114 --> 00:02:39.681
I told you. Ash. I told you.

36
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:40.943
You don't get to just walk away!

37
00:02:41.117 --> 00:02:42.945
This was the only option!

38
00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:43.989
All right?

39
00:02:45.948 --> 00:02:47.123
What happened?

40
00:02:47.254 --> 00:02:49.821
Fuck. it all happened
so fast. you know?

41
00:02:49.952 --> 00:02:51.432
Fuck.

42
00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:53.608
We have to get
him to a hospital.

43
00:02:53.782 --> 00:02:54.913
Jimmy. do you hear me?

44
00:02:54.913 --> 00:02:55.958
We have to get
him to a hospital.

45
00:02:57.568 --> 00:02:58.352
Jimmy?

46
00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:00.267
Jimmy!

47
00:03:03.618 --> 00:03:04.401
He's dead.

48
00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:10.581
Okay.

49
00:03:10.581 --> 00:03:12.061
Ashley. Ashley. Ashley. baby.

50
00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.410
Baby. listen to me.

51
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.542
Listen to me.

52
00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:17.632
We gotta keep it together okay?

53
00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.200
I need you to be strong.

54
00:03:20.287 --> 00:03:21.940
Can you do that for me?

55
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.028
Yeah.

56
00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.856
Okay.

57
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.031
All right. drive.

58
00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:28.208
Drive to the boat
launch near the dump.

59
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.774
Mitch's boat is tied up there.

60
00:03:31.298 --> 00:03:32.168
Okay.

61
00:03:53.407 --> 00:03:54.669
Are you okay?

62
00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:56.888
Hey. baby.

63
00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.455
Are you okay?
Come on.

64
00:03:58.542 --> 00:03:59.630
Come on.

65
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.241
We need to hurry okay. sweetie?

66
00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:03.765
We don't have much time.

67
00:04:05.854 --> 00:04:07.377
I love you. baby.
You're gonna be okay.

68
00:04:09.074 --> 00:04:10.859
Yeah. I'm okay.

69
00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:11.773
I'm okay.

70
00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:13.078
Just head down
to the boat okay?

71
00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.689
I'll meet you there.

72
00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:15.603
Okay.

73
00:04:25.003 --> 00:04:26.483
It's me.

74
00:04:26.483 --> 00:04:27.919
Where have I been?

75
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.834
Mitch is fucking dead.

76
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:30.705
Did you hear me?

77
00:04:32.097 --> 00:04:34.491
I said Mitch is dead.

78
00:04:34.491 --> 00:04:36.363
Look. I did what you asked.

79
00:04:36.493 --> 00:04:37.625
Yes. I have it!

80
00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.541
I don't give a shit!

81
00:04:40.715 --> 00:04:42.107
When Donnie finds it
missing he probably

82
00:04:42.238 --> 00:04:43.500
already knows I'm a dead man!

83
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:46.721
You need to protect my
wife and my daughter!

84
00:04:46.938 --> 00:04:48.113
Don't tell me to calm down!

85
00:04:48.113 --> 00:04:48.853
Do you know Donnie?

86
00:04:50.725 --> 00:04:52.117
Listen. one hour.

87
00:04:52.248 --> 00:04:53.293
Same place as always.

88
00:04:54.555 --> 00:04:56.252
I give you the drive.

89
00:04:56.383 --> 00:04:58.298
You protect my family.

90
00:05:41.993 --> 00:05:43.734
How the fuck do
you let this happen?

91
00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:44.692
Fuck!

92
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.655
How the holy fucking Christ
can you let this happen?

93
00:05:51.655 --> 00:05:53.004
Huh?

94
00:05:53.004 --> 00:05:55.050
What's the fucking
point of two guys

95
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.878
at the fucking door to my club.

96
00:05:57.008 --> 00:05:59.576
two men at the door
to my fucking office?

97
00:05:59.576 --> 00:06:00.838
How'd this happen?

98
00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:02.927
Tell me how the fuck
it happened. huh?

99
00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:04.146
You fucking morons.

100
00:06:05.147 --> 00:06:06.366
Fucking hell.

101
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.846
I wanna fucking know
who stole from me

102
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.674
and I want his fucking
head on a fucking platter

103
00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:13.373
so I can serve him up
to my fucking friends!

104
00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:14.243
It was Jimmy.

105
00:06:15.157 --> 00:06:16.201
I'm sorry. say that again.

106
00:06:16.332 --> 00:06:17.768
It was Jimmy and
some other guy.

107
00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:19.030
What the fuck would
Jimmy want with the drive?

108
00:06:19.204 --> 00:06:20.380
He doesn't even know what it is.

109
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.381
I don't know. boss.

110
00:06:21.468 --> 00:06:22.991
Of course you don't know.

111
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:25.472
Okay.

112
00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:27.212
All right. let's just
calm down. all right?

113
00:06:27.212 --> 00:06:29.171
Get everyone. I mean
fucking everyone.

114
00:06:30.738 --> 00:06:32.566
I want Jimmy at the foot
of my desk within the hour.

115
00:06:36.265 --> 00:06:37.135
Now!

116
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.943
Find a safe
place to hide this.

117
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.813
What is this?

118
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.207
Do you trust me?

119
00:07:05.381 --> 00:07:06.817
Yes. I trust you.

120
00:07:06.817 --> 00:07:08.645
I trust you with my life.

121
00:07:08.645 --> 00:07:10.212
But this is crazy.

122
00:07:10.299 --> 00:07:11.431
I have a way out of here.

123
00:07:11.518 --> 00:07:13.868
To start fresh
with a clean slate.

124
00:07:13.955 --> 00:07:15.826
But I can't trust
anyone anymore.

125
00:07:15.826 --> 00:07:17.741
Donnie most likely
knows it was me by now.

126
00:07:17.828 --> 00:07:20.657
so you and Sarah aren't
safe in the city.

127
00:07:20.657 --> 00:07:22.442
You guys need to leave town now.

128
00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:23.834
Immediately.

129
00:07:23.834 --> 00:07:26.228
I will catch up once
I sort this all out.

130
00:07:26.315 --> 00:07:28.535
Leave town and go where?

131
00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:29.579
We don't have anywhere to go.

132
00:07:31.407 --> 00:07:32.669
There is one place.

133
00:07:36.412 --> 00:07:37.457
No.

134
00:07:37.544 --> 00:07:38.458
No way.

135
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.937
No one will find you there.

136
00:07:40.068 --> 00:07:42.070
I haven't talked to him
in over a decade. okay?

137
00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:43.898
I don't even know if
he's there anymore.

138
00:07:43.898 --> 00:07:45.726
I mean he could be
dead for all I know.

139
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.250
Ash. think about it.

140
00:07:48.337 --> 00:07:49.773
No one knows about your dad.

141
00:07:49.904 --> 00:07:50.992
And no one will think to look

142
00:07:51.122 --> 00:07:53.255
in the Cayman Islands
for you and Sarah.

143
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.909
You said you trust me. right?

144
00:07:57.128 --> 00:07:59.348
You guys gotta get on the
next flight out of here.

145
00:08:00.915 --> 00:08:02.003
It's best for Sarah.

146
00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:04.179
Best for Sarah?

147
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:05.397
Okay. that man shouldn't
be allowed within

148
00:08:05.528 --> 00:08:08.488
200 yards of our child.
much less any kid.

149
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.793
You gotta go.

150
00:08:09.924 --> 00:08:11.055
I love you.

151
00:08:27.724 --> 00:08:28.638
Hey sweetheart.

152
00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:30.640
Mom. what's going on?

153
00:08:32.468 --> 00:08:35.515
Um well your dad and
I planned a big surprise

154
00:08:35.602 --> 00:08:37.691
for your birthday
next week and we're

155
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:40.911
taking you to a beautiful
tropical island. okay?

156
00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:41.956
Surprise!

157
00:08:44.175 --> 00:08:45.133
Gotta hurry. okay?

158
00:08:45.263 --> 00:08:46.917
Come on. we gotta go.

159
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:48.919
Okay. up up up.

160
00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:50.704
But what about my test
on Othello next week?

161
00:08:50.791 --> 00:08:51.748
I'm not done reading it.

162
00:08:51.748 --> 00:08:52.619
Okay.

163
00:08:52.749 --> 00:08:53.707
It's gonna come with us.

164
00:08:53.707 --> 00:08:55.970
Come on. we gotta hurry. baby.

165
00:08:56.057 --> 00:08:57.841
Go go go go.
Come on.

166
00:09:33.964 --> 00:09:34.878
Hey Jimmy.

167
00:09:35.052 --> 00:09:36.314
Donnie wants to see you.

168
00:10:26.016 --> 00:10:26.843
Okay.

169
00:10:29.454 --> 00:10:30.630
First time to Cayman?

170
00:10:31.674 --> 00:10:33.110
First time to anywhere.

171
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:35.809
Oh. well you're
gonna love the island.

172
00:10:35.809 --> 00:10:37.419
Do you have family meeting you?

173
00:10:37.506 --> 00:10:38.812
My grandpa lives here.

174
00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:40.770
Is he going to pick you up?

175
00:10:40.944 --> 00:10:41.728
No.

176
00:10:43.077 --> 00:10:44.513
But I have his address.

177
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.125
Okay sweetie. so after we
land you stay on the plane

178
00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:50.258
and I'll make sure you
get where you need to go.

179
00:10:50.432 --> 00:10:51.433

Hello?

Ahh!

189

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. it's
okay. little girl.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

192

You scared the shit out of me.

193

Are you okay?

194
00:13:00.562 --> 00:13:01.563
Did I hurt you?

195

I'm looking for Jim Benton.

Why are you asking
about Jim and Matt?

204
00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.240
What the fuck are
you doing here?

205
00:13:26.327 --> 00:13:27.763
He's my grandfather!

What?

207
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:34.596
My mom said he lived here.

208
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:37.947
Do you know how I can find him?

209
00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:42.343
I'm Matt.

210

Matt Benton?

211
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:45.607
No. Benton's the
other guy's name.

212
00:13:45.694 --> 00:13:46.913
I'm Matt Robbins.

213
00:13:46.913 --> 00:13:48.436
But people on the island
just call me Matt.

214
00:13:48.436 --> 00:13:50.133
You're not from here?

215
00:13:50.264 --> 00:13:51.613
No sir. I'm from the city.

216
00:13:53.267 --> 00:13:54.442
What's your name?

217
00:13:54.572 --> 00:13:55.356
Sarah.

What have you got there?

220
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.192
Is this your daughter?

221
00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.195
Oh shit. oh shit.

222
00:14:09.152 --> 00:14:10.414
Wow.

223
00:14:10.588 --> 00:14:12.590
Yeah. that's Ashley.

224
00:14:13.722 --> 00:14:14.723
That's my daughter.

225
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.425
She looks all grown
up now. you know?

226
00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:24.428
How old are you?

227
00:14:24.428 --> 00:14:25.821
12.

228
00:14:25.952 --> 00:14:28.432
Well technically I'm 11.
but I'll be 12 in six days.

229
00:14:29.912 --> 00:14:31.522
How old are you?

230
00:14:31.696 --> 00:14:34.656
I don't know. I stopped
counting when I turned 30.

231
00:14:34.743 --> 00:14:37.093
60. late-60s I guess.

232
00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:38.616
Maybe 70.

233
00:14:40.662 --> 00:14:42.055
Are you hungry?

234
00:14:42.055 --> 00:14:43.404
You look hungry.

235
00:14:44.579 --> 00:14:46.494
I might have some
baloney sandwiches.

236
00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:48.800
You like baloney?

237
00:15:22.704 --> 00:15:23.705
I checked her. boss.

238
00:15:23.705 --> 00:15:25.185
No hard drive.

239
00:15:25.185 --> 00:15:27.143
Just a receipt for two
tickets to the Cayman Islands.

240
00:15:27.143 --> 00:15:29.102
Looks like the kid
left about an hour ago.

241
00:15:29.102 --> 00:15:30.277
Next one's for tomorrow.

242
00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:34.498
Where's Jimmy?

243
00:15:34.585 --> 00:15:36.587
"Where's Jimmy?"

244
00:15:36.718 --> 00:15:37.806
Where's fucking Jimmy?

245
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:42.115
Where's my fucking hard drive?

246
00:15:42.245 --> 00:15:43.072
Hmm?

247
00:15:45.161 --> 00:15:47.294
Where's my fucking hard drive?

248
00:15:50.471 --> 00:15:52.299
Here we go.
Bobo go get Jimmy.

249
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:56.738
Bobo what the fuck?

250
00:15:58.218 --> 00:15:58.958
Sorry boss.

251
00:15:59.915 --> 00:16:01.699
You kidding me?

252
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.927
Oh my God!

253
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.584
Look at you two.

254
00:16:16.714 --> 00:16:18.455
What a fucking mess.

255
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:20.718
Look. I'm gonna make
this real easy for you.

256
00:16:20.718 --> 00:16:21.589
All right?

257
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.592
Where.
Is.

258
00:16:24.722 --> 00:16:26.768
My fucking hard drive?

259
00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:28.291
No no no no no no please!

260
00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:30.250
Please don't. please!

261
00:16:31.077 --> 00:16:32.078
Please.

262
00:16:32.948 --> 00:16:34.950
You know what I think?

263
00:16:36.821 --> 00:16:39.302
I think Mr. Romance
here gave you the drive.

264
00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:41.478
And you sent it
ahead to the Caymans.

265
00:16:41.609 --> 00:16:43.002
With your daughter.

266
00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.177
Am I right?

267
00:16:44.177 --> 00:16:46.135
Look at me.

268
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.877
Huh?

269
00:16:51.097 --> 00:16:53.012
Does she know she
has the hard drive?

270
00:16:57.233 --> 00:16:58.669
Ah.

271
00:16:58.887 --> 00:17:00.323
All right. the girl's got it.

272
00:17:00.323 --> 00:17:02.673
Get on that flight with this
bitch. take Bobo with you.

273
00:17:02.847 --> 00:17:05.067
and do not come back without
my fucking hard drive.

274
00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:06.112
What the fuck. Donnie?

275
00:17:06.242 --> 00:17:07.461
It's a little girl.

276
00:17:07.765 --> 00:17:09.028
I can handle this.

277
00:17:09.115 --> 00:17:11.334
I don't need Bobo with me.

278
00:17:11.465 --> 00:17:13.119
I know you can
handle it. okay?

279
00:17:13.249 --> 00:17:14.685
I know this.

280
00:17:14.772 --> 00:17:16.209
Don't think because I'm
asking Bobo to go with you

281
00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:17.514
doesn't mean that I don't
trust you or have faith

282
00:17:17.688 --> 00:17:20.213
in your ability 'cause
I do. all right?

283
00:17:20.343 --> 00:17:23.433
The hard drive is important
not just to me. but to Hector.

284
00:17:23.564 --> 00:17:24.826
All right?

285
00:17:24.913 --> 00:17:26.306
Now take Bobo with you.

286
00:17:29.352 --> 00:17:30.484
Hey.

287
00:17:31.876 --> 00:17:34.705
My friends are gonna go back
with you to get my drive. okay?

288
00:17:34.836 --> 00:17:35.706
What about Jimmy?

289
00:17:35.837 --> 00:17:37.056
No no.

290
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.274
No. he needs a doctor

291
00:17:38.274 --> 00:17:40.146
No. you don't
worry about Jimmy.

292
00:17:40.146 --> 00:17:42.670
All right?
Jimmy's gonna stay here with me.

293
00:17:42.757 --> 00:17:44.715
You need to worry about
getting my hard drive.

294
00:17:44.802 --> 00:17:46.369
Now if you cause any
kind of commotion.

295
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.718
you draw attention
to the police.

296
00:17:47.805 --> 00:17:50.939
you do something stupid.
you do fucking anything

297
00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:53.855
to compromise my friends here.
I swear to fucking Christ

298
00:17:54.725 --> 00:17:57.380
Jimmy will suffer worse
than you can imagine.

299
00:17:57.902 --> 00:17:58.903
Am I fucking clear?

300
00:18:00.731 --> 00:18:01.863
Tell me we're clear.

301
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.517
- We're clear.
- Thank you.

302
00:18:03.517 --> 00:18:05.040
Get this bitch the
fuck out of my face.

303
00:18:16.138 --> 00:18:17.487
Hey Bobo.

304
00:18:17.661 --> 00:18:19.098
Come here.

305
00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:20.360
You get that drive back.

306
00:18:20.577 --> 00:18:22.492
you kill that bitch
and her daughter.

307
00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:24.755
Take them out to the
ocean. drop them deep.

308
00:18:24.842 --> 00:18:26.409
- Understood.
- Hey Bobo.

309
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.630
Don't make me come out there.

310
00:18:30.326 --> 00:18:31.414
You know I fucking
hate the heat.

311
00:18:31.719 --> 00:18:33.242
- Understood.
- All right.

312
00:18:39.857 --> 00:18:42.904
I'm all out of cold cuts.

313
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:44.862
But I do have some crunchy shit.

314
00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:49.998
No ice huh?

315
00:18:50.085 --> 00:18:52.000
I'm sorry there
princess. no ice.

316
00:18:52.087 --> 00:18:54.524
The freezer's broke.
fridge only does enough

317
00:18:54.655 --> 00:18:57.310
to keep the meat from
turning blue. but enough

318
00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.443
about my current
electrical current issues.

319
00:19:00.574 --> 00:19:02.663
What. pray tell.
are you doing here?

320
00:19:03.968 --> 00:19:05.231
Pray tell?

321
00:19:05.231 --> 00:19:07.842
Yeah. what are you
doing here. now. today?

322
00:19:07.972 --> 00:19:10.801
I haven't seen my daughter
since her mom died

323
00:19:10.975 --> 00:19:12.151
and now her daughter shows up

324
00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:14.327
at my front doorstep
with not a word.

325
00:19:14.327 --> 00:19:16.459
It makes a man
curious. you know?

326
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.939
What are you doing here?

327
00:19:18.026 --> 00:19:18.896
Pray tell.

328
00:19:20.028 --> 00:19:22.422
I think my parents are
in some kind of trouble.

329
00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:23.640
Oh Ashley's in trouble.

330
00:19:23.771 --> 00:19:25.425
Okay. well there's a shocker.

331
00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:27.383
What is it this time?

332
00:19:27.383 --> 00:19:28.297
She in jail?

333
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:32.040
Okay. that was mean.

334
00:19:32.127 --> 00:19:33.998
That wasn't. goddammit.
I didn't mean that.

335
00:19:34.129 --> 00:19:35.348
I'm sorry.

336
00:19:35.478 --> 00:19:37.176
I'm sorry. just tell
me what happened.

337
00:19:40.875 --> 00:19:44.966
Up until last night.
mom told me you were dead.

338
00:19:45.053 --> 00:19:46.359
It's easy to see why.

339
00:19:46.359 --> 00:19:47.621
Sorry I bothered you.

340
00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:49.840
No no no. Sarah.
Sarah. I'm sorry.

341
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.973
Sorry. I was a shitty dad.

342
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.714
I won't argue that.

343
00:19:53.888 --> 00:19:56.499
But right now I really need you

344
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.633
to tell me what
happened to your mom.

345
00:19:59.763 --> 00:20:00.764
Please?

346
00:20:03.027 --> 00:20:04.899
Yesterday I
came home early from school

347
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:07.293
and I could hear my mom and
dad arguing about something.

348
00:20:07.423 --> 00:20:08.598
Mom. dad. I'm home!

349
00:20:08.598 --> 00:20:10.078
Dad was
saying something about

350
00:20:10.165 --> 00:20:11.949
"no other way out" and
he needed mom's help.

351
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.604
Later that night mom woke me
up in the middle of the night.

352
00:20:14.604 --> 00:20:17.477
She packed my bag and went
straight to the airport.

353
00:20:20.044 --> 00:20:21.698
Mom tried to get a
ticket for her as well.

354
00:20:21.829 --> 00:20:23.613
but they only had one seat left.

355
00:20:23.613 --> 00:20:25.311
So she put me on the
plane and she handed me

356
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:27.051
some money and gave
me this address

357
00:20:27.182 --> 00:20:28.792
and said I'd find you here.

358
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.099
I know something's wrong.

359
00:20:32.013 --> 00:20:33.232
Hmm...

360
00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:35.321
Where's your mom now?

361
00:20:35.321 --> 00:20:37.366
Well she said she
would be here tomorrow.

362
00:20:40.195 --> 00:20:42.241
Why do you have two names?

363
00:20:43.851 --> 00:20:46.593
I'm gonna find out when the
flights are landing tomorrow.

364
00:20:48.072 --> 00:20:51.032
Oh. you want some
more soda water?

365
00:20:51.206 --> 00:20:52.251
No thanks.

366
00:21:03.523 --> 00:21:05.481
All right. all right.

367
00:21:07.657 --> 00:21:08.789
I got this.

368
00:21:15.404 --> 00:21:16.971
I was wondering
when you were gonna call

369
00:21:17.101 --> 00:21:18.973
and tell me what
happened tonight.

370
00:21:19.103 --> 00:21:20.583
How do you know what happened?

371
00:21:20.714 --> 00:21:22.368
Oh Donnie. please.

372
00:21:22.498 --> 00:21:23.760
I know everything.

373
00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:25.588
I've always told you
never underestimate

374
00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:27.764
the power of information.

375
00:21:27.764 --> 00:21:29.897
And the fact that you
don't know that I know

376
00:21:30.027 --> 00:21:32.378
already puts you in a weakened
position and we haven't

377
00:21:32.465 --> 00:21:35.163
even started talking
about the problem at hand.

378
00:21:36.164 --> 00:21:38.427
Which is my missing hard drive?

379
00:21:39.733 --> 00:21:41.300
You know. I had it before.

380
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.779
I'll get it again.

381
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.826
You have 24 hours before I
step in and solve this myself.

382
00:21:45.956 --> 00:21:47.480
Hey. I can deal with it.

383
00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.785
I hope so.

384
00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:50.134
Because if you can't
it begs the question

385
00:21:50.265 --> 00:21:51.875
what use are you at all?

386
00:22:04.845 --> 00:22:06.150
Fuck!

387
00:22:06.281 --> 00:22:07.108
Fuck!

388
00:22:07.195 --> 00:22:08.065
Fuck!

389
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.937
Fuck!

390
00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:25.126
All done?

391
00:22:25.213 --> 00:22:26.301
Yes. thank you.

392
00:22:26.301 --> 00:22:27.737
Mom never lets me eat in bed.

393
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:28.738
Really?

394
00:22:28.912 --> 00:22:30.349
That's weird.

395
00:22:30.436 --> 00:22:31.698
She used to love it.

396
00:22:33.569 --> 00:22:34.744
You're a football fan?

397
00:22:34.744 --> 00:22:36.267
I love football.

398
00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:37.747
I want to be a quarterback
when I grow up.

399
00:22:37.921 --> 00:22:38.879
Good.

400
00:22:39.749 --> 00:22:42.448
Are there a lot of
girl quarterbacks?

401
00:22:43.013 --> 00:22:45.364
Girls can do
anything guys can do.

402
00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:47.583
I'm the fastest
player on my team.

403
00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:49.368
Okay. well let's talk football

404
00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:51.370
tomorrow when your
mom gets here.

405
00:22:51.587 --> 00:22:53.110
Why do you have two names?

406
00:22:56.766 --> 00:22:59.160
I'll tell you
sometime over a beer.

407
00:22:59.160 --> 00:22:59.987
Goodnight.

408
00:23:34.456 --> 00:23:35.805
Hi. you've
reached Ashley.

409
00:23:35.805 --> 00:23:36.980
I can't get to my
phone right now.

410
00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.981
Leave a message.

411
00:23:55.651 --> 00:23:57.044
Purpose for your visit?

412
00:23:57.218 --> 00:23:58.698
Business or pleasure?

413
00:23:58.828 --> 00:23:59.742
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

414
00:24:23.026 --> 00:24:24.637
Is this the place?

415
00:24:26.508 --> 00:24:27.857
Hey.

416
00:24:27.857 --> 00:24:29.337
Is this the place?

417
00:24:29.337 --> 00:24:31.295
I don't know. I've
never been here.

418
00:24:34.298 --> 00:24:36.779
Listen. I am in no
mood for bullshit.

419
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.173
So you better fucking tell
me where that disc is.

420
00:24:39.303 --> 00:24:40.783
Or I'm gonna tear
your fucking arms off.

421
00:24:40.914 --> 00:24:42.481
- You understand me?
- Mmmhm.

422
00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:43.351
Hard drive.

423
00:24:45.832 --> 00:24:47.094
What?

424
00:24:47.311 --> 00:24:48.530
You said disc.

425
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.271
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

426
00:24:50.358 --> 00:24:51.968
Hey. I don't know. you know?

427
00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:53.709
Maybe she thinks you meant disc.

428
00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:55.232
That's not what Donnie needs.

429
00:24:55.363 --> 00:24:57.757
You think I don't know
what fucking Donnie needs?

430
00:24:57.887 --> 00:25:00.281
Shut the fuck up. get in
there. and check it out.

431
00:25:00.281 --> 00:25:01.500
Yes sir. boss.

432
00:25:03.545 --> 00:25:04.633
Jesus fucking Christ.

433
00:25:13.947 --> 00:25:15.296
Well she was here.

434
00:25:17.037 --> 00:25:18.299
But there's no hard drive.

435
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.784
I want that
fucking hard drive.

436
00:25:31.704 --> 00:25:32.835
Are you rich?

437
00:25:32.966 --> 00:25:35.272
Well that depends
upon your perspective.

438
00:25:35.403 --> 00:25:37.840
If you can't afford this
breakfast then I'm rich

439
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:40.060
because I can afford
to pay for it.

440
00:25:43.063 --> 00:25:43.890
Ah.

441
00:25:46.762 --> 00:25:48.242
So how'd you end up here?

442
00:25:48.372 --> 00:25:50.200
Well I don't like cold weather

443
00:25:50.374 --> 00:25:51.854
and I don't like too much rain.

444
00:25:51.985 --> 00:25:55.989
but I do like to fish. so
seemed like a good place.

445
00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:56.946
You retired?

446
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.469
Yeah.

447
00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.688
How long you been retired?

448
00:26:01.777 --> 00:26:03.562
About 20 years I guess.

449
00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:04.867
Why'd you retire?

450
00:26:04.998 --> 00:26:07.740
It wasn't my choice.
I was told to retire.

451
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.176
By who?

452
00:26:09.306 --> 00:26:10.394
You writing a book?

453
00:26:10.525 --> 00:26:11.831
Who'd you work for?

454
00:26:11.961 --> 00:26:13.833
I worked for Uncle Sam.

455
00:26:13.963 --> 00:26:15.051
The government.

456
00:26:15.182 --> 00:26:16.662
Yep. I worked for
the government.

457
00:26:16.662 --> 00:26:18.968
Did you know Uncle Sam is
actually based on a real person?

458
00:26:19.142 --> 00:26:20.056
No.

459
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.667
His name was Sam Wilson.

460
00:26:21.667 --> 00:26:24.017
He was a meat packer
during the War of 1812.

461
00:26:24.104 --> 00:26:26.106
The troops got to calling
the meat Uncle Sam's meat.

462
00:26:26.236 --> 00:26:27.716
And from that point
on it was used

463
00:26:27.847 --> 00:26:29.588
as a unifying cry
to the Americans.

464
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:30.763
Impressive.

465
00:26:30.763 --> 00:26:32.678
Remind me to avoid
trivia games with you.

466
00:26:33.853 --> 00:26:35.245
So what did you do
for the government?

467
00:26:35.463 --> 00:26:36.638
I was an arbitrator.

468
00:26:37.639 --> 00:26:39.989
I'm guessing you know the
origin story of arbitration too.

469
00:26:40.294 --> 00:26:41.861
No. I don't know what that is.

470
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:43.079
Is it like a lawyer?

471
00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.474
Yes. but in my case
I was more of a...

472
00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.824
Negotiator.

473
00:26:48.911 --> 00:26:51.653
So if two sides couldn't
come to an agreement

474
00:26:51.653 --> 00:26:55.483
they'd send me in to
sort out the argument.

475
00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.399
Were you good at your job?

476
00:26:59.226 --> 00:27:00.444
I got the job done.

477
00:27:00.575 --> 00:27:01.794
Then why'd you retire?

478
00:27:01.794 --> 00:27:03.883
Told you.
it wasn't my choice.

479
00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.798
Can I ask you a question?

480
00:27:05.798 --> 00:27:07.060
Oh now you're asking?

481
00:27:07.147 --> 00:27:08.801
You already asked me
a hundred questions.

482
00:27:08.801 --> 00:27:10.280
You won't get mad?

483
00:27:10.454 --> 00:27:13.893
Sarah. you
always knock me for a loop.

484
00:27:14.023 --> 00:27:15.721
What's the question?

485
00:27:15.938 --> 00:27:17.636
Why did mom tell
me you were dead?

486
00:27:18.462 --> 00:27:20.508
I always wanted a grandfather.

487
00:27:20.508 --> 00:27:23.946
I had a grandmother.
but it's different.

488
00:27:24.077 --> 00:27:25.121
She probably
wouldn't let you order

489
00:27:25.252 --> 00:27:27.123
a double stack with
extra chocolate chips.

490
00:27:27.297 --> 00:27:28.734
Here. have some more
syrup. sweetheart.

491
00:27:28.734 --> 00:27:31.432
- There you go.
- Or asked if I wanted a beer.

492
00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:32.912
Yeah.

493
00:27:39.266 --> 00:27:40.702
Now listen. kid.

494
00:27:40.963 --> 00:27:43.139
If you mother
wanted you to think

495
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.185
that I'm dead. it's
for your own good.

496
00:27:45.489 --> 00:27:47.100
You see. when she
was a little girl

497
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.059
I was home all of two
months out of the year.

498
00:27:50.407 --> 00:27:52.235
And when I was home I was...

499
00:27:54.107 --> 00:27:55.761
No fun.

500
00:27:55.848 --> 00:27:58.546
And then when June.
your other grandmother.

501
00:27:58.633 --> 00:28:03.769
got sick I just up and left
to some godforsaken country.

502
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:07.207
I left your mother all alone
to take care of her mother.

503
00:28:07.729 --> 00:28:11.690
So if she wants to
visualise me as "dead"

504
00:28:11.777 --> 00:28:14.040
then she has every right.

505
00:28:17.565 --> 00:28:19.349
All right. well let's go.

506
00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.481
We should go.

507
00:28:28.445 --> 00:28:30.970
I forgive you. grandpa.

508
00:28:43.939 --> 00:28:46.159
Jesus Christ it's fucking hot.

509
00:28:51.077 --> 00:28:52.818
Hey.

510
00:28:52.948 --> 00:28:53.732
Take it easy.

511
00:29:00.956 --> 00:29:02.523
You ever see someone
try to walk around

512
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:03.611
without one of these?

513
00:29:05.482 --> 00:29:06.614
It's really fucked up.

514
00:29:09.399 --> 00:29:10.879
You see. this little tendon here

515
00:29:11.967 --> 00:29:13.229
has a lot to do
with your ability

516
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.753
to walk around
and stand upright.

517
00:29:16.624 --> 00:29:21.760
So if you don't tell
me where that disc...

518
00:29:26.155 --> 00:29:30.377
If you don't tell where
that hard drive is.

519
00:29:30.638 --> 00:29:34.294
I'm going to snip
that fucking tendon.

520
00:29:34.468 --> 00:29:37.645
And watch you hop around
like a fucking invalid.

521
00:29:38.951 --> 00:29:40.648
Until you shit me
out a hard drive.

522
00:30:01.103 --> 00:30:02.583
Hey kid.

523
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:03.627
Why don't you slouch down.

524
00:30:03.758 --> 00:30:05.804
Just lay low for a few minutes.

525
00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:07.196
Why?

526
00:30:07.196 --> 00:30:09.155
Well you said your parents
were in trouble right?

527
00:30:10.286 --> 00:30:11.505
Yeah. I guess.

528
00:30:11.679 --> 00:30:13.681
Well then would you
mind slouching down?

529
00:30:14.987 --> 00:30:16.162
Yeah. yeah. okay.

530
00:30:16.336 --> 00:30:17.685
Good.

531
00:30:17.685 --> 00:30:19.992
Stay down until I
tell you it's okay.

532
00:30:19.992 --> 00:30:20.949
I'll be right back.

533
00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:26.607
Whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa.

534
00:30:26.694 --> 00:30:28.000
Take it easy. slow down.

535
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.610
Who the fuck is that?

536
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.438
That's my father.

537
00:30:31.438 --> 00:30:32.482
I think.

538
00:30:32.569 --> 00:30:33.701
He doesn't know
anything about this.

539
00:30:33.788 --> 00:30:35.007
Where
the fuck is your kid?

540
00:30:35.007 --> 00:30:35.964
I don't know. I swear.

541
00:30:38.358 --> 00:30:39.446
Dad.

542
00:30:39.707 --> 00:30:40.621
Where's Sarah?

543
00:30:40.708 --> 00:30:42.014
Don't worry.

544
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:43.319
Fellas!

545
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.278
Welcome to the island!

546
00:30:45.278 --> 00:30:46.583
You friends of Ashley?

547
00:30:46.583 --> 00:30:47.497
Ow!

548
00:30:47.628 --> 00:30:48.847
Dad what's wrong?

549
00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:49.848
It's just my back.

550
00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:51.110
I just gotta sit down.

551
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.415
Sorry guys. just...

552
00:30:54.287 --> 00:30:56.593
I've been dealing with
this crap for six years.

553
00:30:59.118 --> 00:31:00.597
Okay. that's better.

554
00:31:02.034 --> 00:31:05.298
I'll tell you. once you
hit 60 the warranty's off.

555
00:31:05.385 --> 00:31:07.300
You know what I mean?

556
00:31:07.387 --> 00:31:10.303
You guys gotta invest in
some better beachwear.

557
00:31:10.303 --> 00:31:12.522
Aren't you dying
in those jackets?

558
00:31:13.959 --> 00:31:17.571
Listen. we don't mean
to be rude. but we believe

559
00:31:17.701 --> 00:31:20.966
you have something we're
looking for and ideally

560
00:31:21.053 --> 00:31:24.186
I'd like to grab it and be on
the next flight out of here.

561
00:31:24.404 --> 00:31:26.536
I don't have anything!

562
00:31:26.754 --> 00:31:29.670
Ashley what's the Dapper
Danny talking about?

563
00:31:31.063 --> 00:31:33.195
I am really trying to be nice.

564
00:31:33.326 --> 00:31:34.544
Trying to be nice?

565
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:36.677
But I'm losing my
fucking patience.

566
00:31:36.677 --> 00:31:37.896
No no no. come on!

567
00:31:48.167 --> 00:31:50.909
This guy's fucking crazy.

568
00:32:24.377 --> 00:32:25.508
Dad!

569
00:32:31.297 --> 00:32:32.254
Dad.

570
00:32:33.516 --> 00:32:35.736
Did you shoot me?

571
00:32:35.954 --> 00:32:37.042
I am so sorry.

572
00:32:37.172 --> 00:32:38.391
- Are you okay?
- Wow!

573
00:32:38.391 --> 00:32:40.393
Did you shoot just me or
did you shoot him too?

574
00:32:40.523 --> 00:32:42.047
No. just you.

575
00:32:42.177 --> 00:32:43.831
Did he get away?

576
00:32:44.005 --> 00:32:45.876
- Yes. and he took your truck.
- Fuck!

577
00:32:46.007 --> 00:32:47.182
You know what?
It is just a truck.

578
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:48.618
This is pretty much you.

579
00:32:48.705 --> 00:32:50.142
You just go straight to
yelling at me for screwing up

580
00:32:50.142 --> 00:32:51.317
Sarah's in the truck!

581
00:32:52.492 --> 00:32:53.362
Fuck!

582
00:33:11.728 --> 00:33:13.774
My drive better be
in your fucking hands.

583
00:33:15.036 --> 00:33:16.603
Bobo.

584
00:33:16.733 --> 00:33:17.647
Bobo!

585
00:33:17.778 --> 00:33:19.258
Bad news. boss.

586
00:33:19.388 --> 00:33:20.128
General's dead.

587
00:33:23.523 --> 00:33:26.308
Ashley. she brought us to
her dad's house. right?

588
00:33:26.308 --> 00:33:28.702
There's nobody there. so I
went inside. I look around.

589
00:33:28.832 --> 00:33:30.269
The little girl had been there

590
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:31.487
but no hard drive.
so we wait around.

591
00:33:31.618 --> 00:33:33.011
Eventually dad comes back.

592
00:33:33.098 --> 00:33:34.534
- Whose dad?
- Whose dad?

593
00:33:34.664 --> 00:33:35.622
I just said Ashley.

594
00:33:35.622 --> 00:33:36.971
Ashley's dad. old guy.

595
00:33:36.971 --> 00:33:38.320
Very very old guy.

596
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:40.496
Anyway. that's when
everything goes south right?

597
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.672
General pulls a gun
and the old man.

598
00:33:42.846 --> 00:33:44.631
I don't know. he killed him.

599
00:33:44.761 --> 00:33:45.893
He killed him?

600
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.025
I thought you just
said General had a gun.

601
00:33:47.112 --> 00:33:48.896
Yeah. well that's
the thing. boss.

602
00:33:48.983 --> 00:33:52.378
The guy used a. what's
the word. a hand weight.

603
00:33:52.813 --> 00:33:54.119
What?

604
00:33:54.206 --> 00:33:55.511
Yeah. you know.
like a dumbbell?

605
00:33:55.642 --> 00:33:58.427
General looks away. old
man hits him over the head.

606
00:33:58.601 --> 00:33:59.733
Boom. kills him.

607
00:33:59.863 --> 00:34:01.691
I just got out of
there with my life.

608
00:34:01.691 --> 00:34:03.345
Ashley's shooting at
me and everything.

609
00:34:03.476 --> 00:34:05.434
Who the fuck kills
someone with weights?

610
00:34:05.565 --> 00:34:06.914
I know. boss.

611
00:34:07.001 --> 00:34:09.482
Personally I've never
seen anything like it.

612
00:34:09.656 --> 00:34:11.832
Sorry for your loss. Donnie.

613
00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:12.920
So to recap.

614
00:34:14.922 --> 00:34:17.011
You didn't get my drive.

615
00:34:17.011 --> 00:34:19.100
My little half brother's dead.

616
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.625
Beaten to death with
a fucking dumbbell.

617
00:34:25.106 --> 00:34:27.065
Anything else you've
forgotten. Bobo?

618
00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:29.328
Well yeah. there's
one other thing.

619
00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:32.592
I got Ashley's kid.

620
00:34:34.463 --> 00:34:35.899
Hold that fucking kid.

621
00:34:36.944 --> 00:34:39.251
Get somewhere low key.

622
00:34:39.251 --> 00:34:42.428
I don't care. just sit tight.

623
00:34:52.525 --> 00:34:55.963
Looks like we gotta
lay low for awhile.

624
00:34:57.312 --> 00:34:59.358
You're not gonna give
me any trouble are you?

625
00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:00.924
Good.

626
00:35:04.145 --> 00:35:05.842
You understand this is
nothing personal right?

627
00:35:06.016 --> 00:35:10.543
This is just what you call
an unfortunate circumstance.

628
00:35:10.717 --> 00:35:13.633
I don't feel one way or the
other about any of this.

629
00:35:13.807 --> 00:35:14.286
Understand?

630
00:35:15.635 --> 00:35:17.071
Good.

631
00:35:17.202 --> 00:35:19.160
So if you give me any
trouble. you don't listen

632
00:35:19.247 --> 00:35:20.596
to what I tell you. I'm gonna
shoot you in the head twice.

633
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:21.902
I'm gonna dump you in the ocean.

634
00:35:21.989 --> 00:35:23.121
and I'm gonna go get a pizza.

635
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:24.426
We clear?

636
00:35:35.176 --> 00:35:39.615
Well we're gonna have to
call the cops about this.

637
00:35:39.789 --> 00:35:41.400
No. dad. they have Sarah.

638
00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.576
They will kill her.

639
00:35:43.663 --> 00:35:45.012
I guarantee you there's
more men that are already

640
00:35:45.099 --> 00:35:47.536
coming for me and that
hard drive and now you

641
00:35:47.667 --> 00:35:49.669
and they will not stop
until we are all dead.

642
00:35:51.279 --> 00:35:54.152
But right now all I care about
is getting my daughter back.

643
00:35:55.675 --> 00:35:57.024
Where's the drive now?

644
00:36:02.377 --> 00:36:03.944
And you don't know
what's on here?

645
00:36:04.031 --> 00:36:05.685
No. I have no idea.

646
00:36:05.815 --> 00:36:07.904
I don't even think Jimmy
knows what's on that.

647
00:36:08.035 --> 00:36:09.645
All I know is that
Jimmy kept telling me

648
00:36:09.819 --> 00:36:10.994
that that drive was our way out.

649
00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:12.735
Out of what?

650
00:36:12.822 --> 00:36:14.041
Everything.

651
00:36:14.128 --> 00:36:16.348
Jimmy was working
full time for Donnie.

652
00:36:16.565 --> 00:36:17.958
As his driver.

653
00:36:18.045 --> 00:36:20.090
And once a guy like Donnie gets

654
00:36:20.221 --> 00:36:22.310
his claws in you it's
hard to get away.

655
00:36:23.616 --> 00:36:24.704
Like ever.

656
00:36:27.707 --> 00:36:30.536
Pretty risky to try and kill
two people in broad daylight.

657
00:36:32.146 --> 00:36:35.367
I'm guessing the Jerry Lewis
Telethon isn't on here.

658
00:36:35.367 --> 00:36:36.672
All right.

659
00:36:36.803 --> 00:36:38.065
Let's get rid of the body.

660
00:36:38.935 --> 00:36:40.198
How do we do that?

661
00:36:42.635 --> 00:36:43.853
I am so sorry that I shot you.

662
00:36:44.027 --> 00:36:44.854
- Are you sure you're okay?
- It's fine.

663
00:36:44.985 --> 00:36:46.508
It's just a graze.

664
00:36:46.595 --> 00:36:49.032
When we get back we should
find a place to lay low.

665
00:36:49.424 --> 00:36:51.078
An out of the way hotel.

666
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:53.080
- Grab an end.
- Oh no. I can't. I

667
00:36:53.167 --> 00:36:54.603
Do I have to do
everything myself?

668
00:36:54.603 --> 00:36:55.517
Okay. you know what?

669
00:36:55.648 --> 00:36:56.605
Fine. I will grab his feet.

670
00:36:56.736 --> 00:36:57.780
Fine.

671
00:36:59.739 --> 00:37:01.044
Okay?
On three.

672
00:37:01.871 --> 00:37:02.916
Two.
One.

673
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:04.526
- Hup!
- Wait wait wait wait wait!

674
00:37:04.526 --> 00:37:05.484
What?

675
00:37:05.614 --> 00:37:06.963
Well what if
someone finds him?

676
00:37:07.094 --> 00:37:10.880
Ashley. this is
the Cayman Trench.

677
00:37:11.098 --> 00:37:12.447
It's a five mile drop down.

678
00:37:12.969 --> 00:37:13.796
There's nobody there.

679
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:15.450
Okay.
Okay.

680
00:37:15.581 --> 00:37:17.060
And.

681
00:37:17.278 --> 00:37:18.453
Hup!

682
00:37:19.976 --> 00:37:21.369
Down she goes.

683
00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:30.726
So that's all for now.

684
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:34.774
I expect your reports
tomorrow morning by 8 AM.

685
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:51.138
So how did it go?

686
00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:52.052
It's a burn.

687
00:37:53.358 --> 00:37:55.360
Whole thing's a burn.

688
00:37:55.534 --> 00:37:58.058
We're talking eight
months of legwork here.

689
00:37:58.058 --> 00:37:59.668
Where's your man inside?

690
00:37:59.799 --> 00:38:00.887
Compromised.

691
00:38:02.497 --> 00:38:03.890
With drive.

692
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.195
So your man

693
00:38:05.326 --> 00:38:07.981
is probably hanging in a
meat locker somewhere

694
00:38:08.111 --> 00:38:10.200
and the drive is back in
the hands of the bad guys.

695
00:38:10.331 --> 00:38:12.072
Is that about the
sum of your report?

696
00:38:12.072 --> 00:38:13.595
Like I said.

697
00:38:13.726 --> 00:38:14.814
It's a burn.

698
00:38:14.944 --> 00:38:16.946
Do I need to tell you
what's on that drive?

699
00:38:17.077 --> 00:38:17.904
No ma'am.

700
00:38:18.034 --> 00:38:19.688
Are you sure?

701
00:38:19.862 --> 00:38:20.863
Quite sure.

702
00:38:51.198 --> 00:38:52.112
Drisdale.

703
00:38:52.547 --> 00:38:53.592
It's me.

704
00:38:55.376 --> 00:38:56.203
Hello?

705
00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:01.904
Do you know your current
file reads "Gone Elvis"?

706
00:39:02.122 --> 00:39:03.079
That's funny.

707
00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.995
I remember you telling me to.

708
00:39:06.518 --> 00:39:09.042
how'd you put it.
do some fishing?

709
00:39:09.172 --> 00:39:10.391
Early retirement?

710
00:39:10.565 --> 00:39:12.219
Oh you know that that
order came from above me.

711
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:13.786
Yeah yeah.

712
00:39:13.786 --> 00:39:16.658
Hand me a sack of shit and
tell me it's fish and chips.

713
00:39:16.789 --> 00:39:18.051
You know as well as I do

714
00:39:18.181 --> 00:39:19.835
that you frustrated
every superior.

715
00:39:20.009 --> 00:39:23.230
and subordinate for that
matter. that you ever had.

716
00:39:23.491 --> 00:39:26.233
You assaulted a two
star general. Matthew.

717
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.756
Do you know what that
guy had going on the side?

718
00:39:27.756 --> 00:39:29.671
I've heard this
all before remember?

719
00:39:29.802 --> 00:39:33.371
And I am very busy. so
if you'll excuse me.

720
00:39:33.458 --> 00:39:34.328
I need.

721
00:39:35.808 --> 00:39:36.896
Your help.

722
00:39:38.854 --> 00:39:42.684
As I recall. asking for help
was not your strong point.

723
00:39:42.902 --> 00:39:44.817
Fair enough.
It's my daughter Ashley.

724
00:39:44.904 --> 00:39:46.166
She's in deep with
some bad people

725
00:39:46.166 --> 00:39:47.689
and I need some information.

726
00:39:47.863 --> 00:39:50.039
Well how serious is
the trouble she's in?

727
00:39:50.126 --> 00:39:51.171
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

728
00:39:51.258 --> 00:39:52.781
I've got two names. Donnie Iger

729
00:39:52.781 --> 00:39:55.175
and some guy who calls
himself The General.

730
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:56.611
How do I reach you?

731
00:39:56.698 --> 00:39:58.091
I'll reach back out to you.

732
00:39:58.265 --> 00:40:01.399
All right. well let me try
to get you some information.

733
00:40:25.248 --> 00:40:26.728
"But I will wear my heart upon

734
00:40:26.859 --> 00:40:29.296
"my sleeve for daws to peck at."

735
00:40:30.471 --> 00:40:32.430
"I am not what I am."

736
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.648
Excuse me?

737
00:40:33.779 --> 00:40:35.433
Iago.

738
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:37.217
Othello's most trusted officer?

739
00:40:37.217 --> 00:40:38.914
- You know Othello?
- Sure.

740
00:40:39.088 --> 00:40:40.916
Why are you so surprised?
It's a famous play.

741
00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:42.309
It's almost like
you're looking at me

742
00:40:42.396 --> 00:40:44.006
like I'm a guy who would
never read Shakespeare.

743
00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.312
Jesus.

744
00:40:45.399 --> 00:40:46.531
I thought your
generation doesn't

745
00:40:46.661 --> 00:40:48.141
judge people by
their appearances.

746
00:40:48.315 --> 00:40:49.098
No. I didn't mean

747
00:40:49.185 --> 00:40:50.056
Take it easy. take it easy.

748
00:40:50.186 --> 00:40:51.449
I'm just kidding you.

749
00:40:55.061 --> 00:40:56.628
Did you have to
read it for school?

750
00:40:58.456 --> 00:41:00.327
Lady. I never
went to no school.

751
00:41:00.414 --> 00:41:03.635
How did you learn to read
if you never went to school?

752
00:41:03.896 --> 00:41:05.071
You ever hear of Oliver Twist?

753
00:41:05.463 --> 00:41:06.725
I think so.

754
00:41:06.725 --> 00:41:07.769
Is he the one who
asks for more soup?

755
00:41:07.943 --> 00:41:09.249
"Please. sir.

756
00:41:09.336 --> 00:41:11.556
"Can I have some more?"

757
00:41:11.643 --> 00:41:13.296
- Is that supposed to be Oliver?
- Are you kidding me?

758
00:41:13.427 --> 00:41:15.429
That was a great Oliver.

759
00:41:15.429 --> 00:41:16.778
Anyway. I was an orphan.

760
00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:19.302
And some guy. he picked me up.

761
00:41:19.433 --> 00:41:20.652
Took me into his house.

762
00:41:20.652 --> 00:41:22.567
He fed me and he taught
me over the years.

763
00:41:22.567 --> 00:41:25.395
Taught me how to read.
taught me how to write.

764
00:41:25.526 --> 00:41:27.963
Taught me how to gather
my thoughts coherently.

765
00:41:28.137 --> 00:41:30.096
Convey them concisely.

766
00:41:30.226 --> 00:41:31.358
Taught me how to shave.

767
00:41:33.578 --> 00:41:35.101
He was a great man.

768
00:41:35.231 --> 00:41:36.798
What happened?

769
00:41:36.798 --> 00:41:39.671
Well you're gonna have to
read Oliver Twist aren't you?

770
00:41:39.671 --> 00:41:41.063
Because his story and mine?

771
00:41:41.934 --> 00:41:43.283
One and the same.

772
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:44.502
That's not possible.

773
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:45.590
What are you talking about?

774
00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.505
"Never trust a coincidence."

775
00:41:47.592 --> 00:41:49.463
My science teacher once said.

776
00:41:49.463 --> 00:41:50.682
Ooh.

777
00:41:50.682 --> 00:41:52.901
Your science teacher huh?

778
00:41:52.901 --> 00:41:55.338
Maybe he thinks I'm
more like Iago huh?

779
00:41:55.469 --> 00:41:57.036
I'm not what I seem to be?

780
00:41:57.166 --> 00:41:59.517
Yeah. you seem shifty.

781
00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:01.301
- What page you on?
- 78.

782
00:42:01.388 --> 00:42:03.216
It's hard to understand.

783
00:42:03.346 --> 00:42:04.304
Yeah. I get that.

784
00:42:04.391 --> 00:42:05.697
All right look.

785
00:42:05.697 --> 00:42:07.699
You keep reading. I
gotta make a call.

786
00:42:07.699 --> 00:42:09.831
I'm gonna ask you a
few questions later.

787
00:42:09.962 --> 00:42:11.267
Pay attention.

788
00:42:14.575 --> 00:42:15.794
Purpose of your visit?

789
00:42:15.924 --> 00:42:17.099
Business or pleasure?

790
00:42:17.186 --> 00:42:18.100
Pleasure.

791
00:42:32.071 --> 00:42:33.507
Where's phone?

792
00:42:33.507 --> 00:42:34.813
Over there. sir.

793
00:42:42.385 --> 00:42:43.561
Bobo's room.

794
00:42:44.649 --> 00:42:45.693
No. just Bobo.

795
00:42:48.304 --> 00:42:50.872
- Yeah.
- Bobo it's us.

796
00:42:51.003 --> 00:42:52.178
What room you in?

797
00:42:52.352 --> 00:42:53.440
528. come on up.

798
00:42:54.789 --> 00:42:56.095
Gonna see your mom soon.

799
00:43:01.143 --> 00:43:02.231
Dad.

800
00:43:02.405 --> 00:43:04.451
I'm sorry Ash. I'm
just trying to...

801
00:43:04.538 --> 00:43:06.061
They're gonna hurt
Sarah aren't they?

802
00:43:06.192 --> 00:43:07.367
No no no. don't
think like that.

803
00:43:07.367 --> 00:43:08.890
You don't know these people.

804
00:43:08.977 --> 00:43:10.849
Killing her is nothing to them.

805
00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:14.592
They won't kill her as
long as we have the drive.

806
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:16.332
But here's what I
don't understand.

807
00:43:16.463 --> 00:43:18.857
How can Sarah be
anywhere near this?

808
00:43:18.857 --> 00:43:20.902
How can you have a life with
her anywhere near these

809
00:43:21.033 --> 00:43:22.991
You don't know
anything about my life.

810
00:43:23.383 --> 00:43:24.689
Or Sarah's.

811
00:43:25.341 --> 00:43:27.692
Jimmy was just a
driver. nothing more.

812
00:43:27.692 --> 00:43:30.608
He didn't hurt people.
he didn't sell drugs.

813
00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:32.000
We were just trying
to get a leg up.

814
00:43:32.087 --> 00:43:33.872
Is that how he ended
up with the hard drive?

815
00:43:34.002 --> 00:43:36.091
He overheard
Donnie talking about

816
00:43:36.222 --> 00:43:38.267
how he was gonna get
a leg up on Hector

817
00:43:38.354 --> 00:43:40.226
and the drive was
gonna make that happen.

818
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.183
Wow.

819
00:43:41.401 --> 00:43:42.445
Wow. okay.

820
00:43:52.151 --> 00:43:53.761
Okay.

821
00:43:56.285 --> 00:43:59.114
Ashley. you are
never responsible.

822
00:43:59.288 --> 00:44:01.290
And now you're a parent and
you're even less responsible.

823
00:44:01.464 --> 00:44:04.816
Oh wow. because you
were some great example

824
00:44:04.816 --> 00:44:06.078
of what a parent should be?

825
00:44:06.165 --> 00:44:07.079
Should I follow your example?

826
00:44:07.166 --> 00:44:08.689
I get it. I get it.

827
00:44:08.689 --> 00:44:11.910
You leave for months on
end with no contact or call

828
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:14.869
because you pretty much missed
every birthday I ever had.

829
00:44:14.869 --> 00:44:16.349
You made your point.

830
00:44:16.479 --> 00:44:17.916
Even when you were in town.
so don't fucking tell me

831
00:44:17.916 --> 00:44:20.483
how to be a parent because
you have no fucking idea!

832
00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.757
-  Where are you going?
- I am going to get some ice.

833
00:44:32.757 --> 00:44:34.541
Ashley those guys could
already be looking for you.

834
00:44:34.541 --> 00:44:36.848
I think I can
get some ice. dad!

835
00:44:37.022 --> 00:44:38.023
Okay.

836
00:44:50.035 --> 00:44:51.036
What?

837
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.037
It's them.

838
00:44:52.124 --> 00:44:53.473
Who?

839
00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:54.692
The bad guys.

840
00:44:54.779 --> 00:44:57.999
- Get away from the door.

841
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.001
Come on. Ashley.

842
00:45:00.132 --> 00:45:02.177
We've got your girl.

843
00:45:02.177 --> 00:45:03.439
I need you
to do something for me

844
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:05.572
and there's probably no way
you're gonna want to do it.

845
00:45:05.659 --> 00:45:06.921
I need you to open
the door really fast.

846
00:45:06.921 --> 00:45:08.140
then I'm gonna grab one of them.

847
00:45:08.227 --> 00:45:09.358
pull them in here.
and then you're gonna

848
00:45:09.445 --> 00:45:11.404
slam the door shut
once he's in here okay?

849
00:45:11.578 --> 00:45:12.884
Have you completely
lost your mind?

850
00:45:12.884 --> 00:45:14.363
I gotta separate these guys.

851
00:45:14.537 --> 00:45:15.713
I can deal with them one at
a time. but not all at once.

852
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.018
Deal with them?

853
00:45:17.149 --> 00:45:20.021
- You can do this.
- I'm gonna count you in. ready?

854
00:45:20.152 --> 00:45:22.502
He's gonna get it
eventually anyway!

855
00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:24.156
You know this is true!

856
00:45:24.243 --> 00:45:26.680
On three. two. one.

857
00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.551
- Go!
- Ashley. don't make me

858
00:45:43.175 --> 00:45:44.742
Is this one of the bad guys?

859
00:45:47.048 --> 00:45:48.746
Yeah. that's one
of Donnie's soldiers.

860
00:45:53.533 --> 00:45:54.752
What's going on?

861
00:45:56.144 --> 00:45:57.363
It's gonna be hard to explain.

862
00:45:57.493 --> 00:45:58.320
Where's Leon?

863
00:45:59.539 --> 00:46:00.453
He took him.

864
00:46:00.583 --> 00:46:02.411
- Who took him?
- Some guy.

865
00:46:02.585 --> 00:46:03.543
He grabbed him. pulled
him into the room.

866
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:05.763
Are you fucking kidding me?

867
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:08.069
Get in there and
fucking get him!

868
00:46:18.863 --> 00:46:19.777
I don't remember.

869
00:46:19.864 --> 00:46:21.082
Were you afraid of heights?

870
00:46:21.213 --> 00:46:22.780
Not really.
Why?

871
00:46:23.824 --> 00:46:25.130
I'm gonna lower you down.

872
00:46:26.174 --> 00:46:27.262
You've gotta be kidding me.

873
00:46:27.393 --> 00:46:28.568
No no. no time
to talk about it.

874
00:46:28.568 --> 00:46:29.438
Just gotta go.

875
00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:31.092
Now Ashley. gotta go now.

876
00:46:31.223 --> 00:46:33.268
All right now. come on.

877
00:46:33.399 --> 00:46:35.270
Here we go.
Come on.

878
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:37.185
There you go.
Off you go.

879
00:46:37.185 --> 00:46:38.099
Up and over.

880
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:39.666
Now Ashley. gotta go right now.

881
00:46:42.538 --> 00:46:43.888
Come on.

882
00:46:44.018 --> 00:46:46.107
That's it.
That's my girl.

883
00:46:47.065 --> 00:46:48.153
You got it.

884
00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:51.678
I can't let go.

885
00:46:51.678 --> 00:46:52.940
- I've got you. let go.
- I can't let go.

886
00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:55.813
Don't make me push you.

887
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:05.431
Come here!

888
00:47:09.565 --> 00:47:10.392
Fuck!

889
00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:00.051
If these guys are willing
to risk killing us in public.

890
00:48:00.355 --> 00:48:02.488
we're gonna need a better
defensive position.

891
00:48:02.618 --> 00:48:04.751
A defensive position?

892
00:48:04.838 --> 00:48:06.971
And how are you
doing these things?

893
00:48:07.101 --> 00:48:08.189
Who are you?

894
00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.757
Ash. I can appreciate
this is a bit weird.

895
00:48:10.757 --> 00:48:12.672
and I can explain a
bit more about my past.

896
00:48:12.759 --> 00:48:13.891
but right now we need to leave.

897
00:48:15.501 --> 00:48:16.589
Oh look at him. we're gonna
give him a heart attack.

898
00:48:16.719 --> 00:48:18.765
Okay. so all of those
times that you were

899
00:48:18.765 --> 00:48:20.549
leaving us for six
months at a time

900
00:48:20.636 --> 00:48:22.682
you were. what. killing people?

901
00:48:22.682 --> 00:48:23.988
No. God!

902
00:48:24.118 --> 00:48:25.163
I mean no.

903
00:48:26.555 --> 00:48:28.079
You were killing people?

904
00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.776
I mean besides the ones
that I've seen you kill?

905
00:48:29.776 --> 00:48:30.995
Hey. I killed
those guys trying

906
00:48:30.995 --> 00:48:33.780
to save your ass. so
give a guy a break.

907
00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.391
- Wait. so-
- Can this guy move any slower?

908
00:48:36.391 --> 00:48:37.523
What. you're some kind
of assassin or something?

909
00:48:38.654 --> 00:48:39.612
Can you open the door?

910
00:48:39.742 --> 00:48:41.483
I gotta get off the balcony!

911
00:48:46.227 --> 00:48:48.012
What the fuck?

912
00:48:48.142 --> 00:48:49.361
Thank you.

913
00:48:49.535 --> 00:48:50.797
You're a gentleman
and a scholar.

914
00:48:50.884 --> 00:48:52.451
- Thank you so much.
- Is it hot?

915
00:48:58.152 --> 00:48:59.675
Jesus Christ.

916
00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:10.512
Whoa whoa. taxi!

917
00:49:13.689 --> 00:49:14.821
That's Ashley.

918
00:49:16.997 --> 00:49:18.390
Who is this guy?

919
00:49:25.136 --> 00:49:27.573
Yes. hello. can you connect me

920
00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.401
to the Cayman Cab
Company please?

921
00:49:29.792 --> 00:49:31.098
Appreciate that. thank you.

922
00:49:31.751 --> 00:49:33.057
Yes. hello.

923
00:49:33.057 --> 00:49:35.842
Look. my father and my
sister just got into

924
00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:37.975
one of your cabs in
front of Seashell Hotel.

925
00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:39.846
And here's the
thing. my father left

926
00:49:39.933 --> 00:49:41.630
all of his heart
medication in the room.

927
00:49:41.804 --> 00:49:44.416
Is it possible for you to
tell me where they're headed?

928
00:49:44.807 --> 00:49:46.418
Well see. that's the weird part.

929
00:49:46.635 --> 00:49:49.899
The phone is with the heart
medication here in the room.

930
00:49:50.117 --> 00:49:50.988
Anyway. I'd really appreciate it

931
00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:52.990
if you could help me out here.

932
00:49:53.251 --> 00:49:55.079
Oh no no no. never again.

933
00:49:55.949 --> 00:49:57.429
They're heading to the
Marina in Capo Bay.

934
00:49:57.516 --> 00:49:58.604
The Capo Bay Marina.

935
00:49:58.821 --> 00:50:01.172
Thank you so much. goodbye.

936
00:50:01.172 --> 00:50:02.260
Asshole.

937
00:50:03.043 --> 00:50:05.176
Hey. that's pretty smart.

938
00:50:10.659 --> 00:50:11.704
The only thing I
want to hear you say

939
00:50:11.878 --> 00:50:13.532
is that you got my drive
and everyone's dead.

940
00:50:13.662 --> 00:50:15.229
Say it.
Say it.

941
00:50:15.664 --> 00:50:17.536
Not exactly. boss.

942
00:50:17.666 --> 00:50:18.798
You're not gonna be happy.

943
00:50:18.798 --> 00:50:20.278
Fuck!

944
00:50:20.278 --> 00:50:21.192
Why is no one answering
their phones. huh?

945
00:50:21.192 --> 00:50:22.541
What the fuck's
going on down there?

946
00:50:22.671 --> 00:50:24.195
Where's Gibson?
Where's Ronik?

947
00:50:24.195 --> 00:50:25.196
Put Ronik on.

948
00:50:25.196 --> 00:50:26.327
See that's the thing. boss.

949
00:50:26.458 --> 00:50:29.026
The old guy. he keeps
killing everybody.

950
00:50:29.243 --> 00:50:30.244
The dad.

951
00:50:30.244 --> 00:50:31.202
Everybody!

952
00:50:51.483 --> 00:50:53.528
I send three of my
best guys down there

953
00:50:53.702 --> 00:50:56.140
to fucking grab a hard
drive from a little girl

954
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:57.750
and her fucking mom
and you're telling me

955
00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.058
the grandfather just killed
three more of my men?

956
00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:02.711
Yeah. pretty much. yeah.

957
00:51:02.885 --> 00:51:04.278
"Pretty much" "pretty much."

958
00:51:04.409 --> 00:51:05.671
Fuck.

959
00:51:05.758 --> 00:51:07.151
Bobo. listen really
carefully all right?

960
00:51:07.238 --> 00:51:09.370
I gotta call Hector. tell her
what the fuck is going on.

961
00:51:09.501 --> 00:51:10.980
so I'm thinking in
the meantime maybe.

962
00:51:11.111 --> 00:51:14.158
I don't know. find out who
the fucking grandpa is?

963
00:51:14.288 --> 00:51:16.160
Can you give me a fucking name?

964
00:51:16.247 --> 00:51:20.077
That's funny boss because
actually. hang on a second.

965
00:51:20.251 --> 00:51:22.253
I got um...

966
00:51:22.253 --> 00:51:23.471
I got two names here.

967
00:51:23.602 --> 00:51:25.082
Okay.

968
00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:27.475
I got a Matt Robbins.

969
00:51:27.475 --> 00:51:29.086
And I got a Jim Benton.

970
00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:30.565
Great. which
one's the grandpa?

971
00:51:30.739 --> 00:51:32.393
Well that's the thing
boss. we're not really sure.

972
00:51:32.524 --> 00:51:35.222
but it's definitely
one of the two.

973
00:51:36.484 --> 00:51:37.659
Fuck!

974
00:51:41.663 --> 00:51:42.577
Sit tight. okay?

975
00:51:42.708 --> 00:51:45.058
Until I fucking get down there.

976
00:51:46.973 --> 00:51:48.366
You guys got passports?

977
00:52:13.913 --> 00:52:14.914
You hungry?

978
00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:19.092
All right.
What's your favourite food?

979
00:52:19.092 --> 00:52:20.441
Pizza.

980
00:52:20.572 --> 00:52:21.877
All right. me too.

981
00:52:25.881 --> 00:52:26.882
I'll make you a deal.

982
00:52:29.798 --> 00:52:30.886
You good on your word?

983
00:52:31.887 --> 00:52:33.237
Yeah.

984
00:52:33.237 --> 00:52:34.325
All right. now I get
that I'm the bad guy

985
00:52:34.325 --> 00:52:35.630
in this particular circumstance.

986
00:52:35.761 --> 00:52:38.067
but your work should
be solid no matter

987
00:52:38.198 --> 00:52:40.548
what side of the fence
you're on. am I right?

988
00:52:40.809 --> 00:52:42.507
Yeah. that makes sense.

989
00:52:42.594 --> 00:52:43.812
All right.

990
00:52:43.986 --> 00:52:45.336
So now we're gonna go.
we're gonna get pizza.

991
00:52:45.336 --> 00:52:46.641
and we're gonna see your mom.

992
00:52:46.772 --> 00:52:47.642
But when we get downstairs

993
00:52:47.773 --> 00:52:49.688
there's gonna
be cops everywhere.

994
00:52:49.818 --> 00:52:51.951
And you gotta be good. okay?

995
00:52:52.908 --> 00:52:55.346
Because if I get
busted. Donnie is gonna

996
00:52:55.346 --> 00:52:57.304
kill your mom sure
as I'm sitting here.

997
00:52:58.392 --> 00:52:59.611
Understand?

998
00:52:59.959 --> 00:53:01.787
Okay. I understand.

999
00:53:01.787 --> 00:53:02.744
All right.

1000
00:53:02.918 --> 00:53:03.702
Let's go.

1001
00:53:05.312 --> 00:53:08.576
Remember. we get caught
your mom dies. yeah?

1002
00:53:08.576 --> 00:53:09.969
I understand.

1003
00:53:10.056 --> 00:53:10.926
Let's go.

1004
00:53:16.932 --> 00:53:17.716
What?

1005
00:53:19.413 --> 00:53:21.198
Why did you want
to be the bad guy?

1006
00:53:24.157 --> 00:53:25.985
You know. I never
really thought about it.

1007
00:53:27.334 --> 00:53:29.380
I've just been the bad
guy from the beginning.

1008
00:53:30.468 --> 00:53:33.210
Just circumstances I guess.

1009
00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:36.517
How about you?

1010
00:53:36.648 --> 00:53:37.692
You the good guy?

1011
00:53:37.823 --> 00:53:39.564
I mean. you know. girl?

1012
00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:46.832
I think so. but it's
not over yet is it?

1013
00:53:48.877 --> 00:53:50.401
That's what I'm saying.

1014
00:53:50.401 --> 00:53:51.576
Circumstances.

1015
00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:53.969
You ready. madam?

1016
00:54:22.128 --> 00:54:22.911
Hang on.

1017
00:55:07.086 --> 00:55:08.566
Captain!

1018
00:55:08.696 --> 00:55:09.697
Captain Joseph!

1019
00:55:10.394 --> 00:55:11.743
Permission to come aboard!

1020
00:55:14.354 --> 00:55:17.096
If you're here for that
$25 you can turn around.

1021
00:55:17.096 --> 00:55:18.315
I didn't cheat.

1022
00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:19.577
Joey.

1023
00:55:19.707 --> 00:55:21.883
Joey. you remember
my daughter Ashley?

1024
00:55:22.057 --> 00:55:22.841
Ashley?

1025
00:55:24.059 --> 00:55:25.539
- Your Ashley?
- Yeh.

1026
00:55:26.279 --> 00:55:28.063
My. little Ashley.

1027
00:55:28.194 --> 00:55:30.327
Well you're not so
little anymore huh?

1028
00:55:33.417 --> 00:55:36.202
My Lord how time flies.

1029
00:55:36.289 --> 00:55:39.510
The last time I saw you you
were about eight years old.

1030
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:40.598
Of course you
wouldn't remember me.

1031
00:55:40.728 --> 00:55:42.774
You were just a wee thing.

1032
00:55:43.775 --> 00:55:45.777
What are you guys doing here?

1033
00:55:45.864 --> 00:55:48.780
Well in short. I'm a
worse parent than he is.

1034
00:55:48.867 --> 00:55:51.043
Ashley and her husband
seem to have gotten

1035
00:55:51.173 --> 00:55:52.653
mixed up with some bad people.

1036
00:55:52.784 --> 00:55:54.655
Ooh.
How bad?

1037
00:55:54.786 --> 00:55:56.309
They tried to kill us.

1038
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:57.310
Twice.

1039
00:55:57.310 --> 00:55:58.529
Hmm

1040
00:55:58.529 --> 00:56:01.270
Little Ash always
getting in trouble.

1041
00:56:01.401 --> 00:56:03.272
Okay. can we focus please?

1042
00:56:03.403 --> 00:56:06.101
Well whoever the players are
they all seem to want this.

1043
00:56:06.232 --> 00:56:08.974
Hey. can I use your computer
and see what's on this thing?

1044
00:56:09.104 --> 00:56:09.975
Yeah.

1045
00:56:10.105 --> 00:56:10.932
Come on.

1046
00:56:12.978 --> 00:56:15.633
Joey here was a
mine sweeper back when

1047
00:56:15.633 --> 00:56:17.112
we were stationed
overseas together.

1048
00:56:18.331 --> 00:56:20.159
For those diplomatic
missions we were on.

1049
00:56:21.334 --> 00:56:23.380
What is a mine sweeper
doing on diplomatic missions?

1050
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.469
Yeah. there.
Click on that.

1051
00:56:25.599 --> 00:56:27.645
Yeah. open that file please.

1052
00:56:29.168 --> 00:56:30.822
Whoa.

1053
00:56:31.213 --> 00:56:32.563
Is this what I think it is?

1054
00:56:32.563 --> 00:56:34.042
What does this have
to do with Jimmy?

1055
00:56:34.216 --> 00:56:36.784
If this is for real I'm
ready to call the agency.

1056
00:56:36.784 --> 00:56:38.569
This is bigger than
anything I've ever seen.

1057
00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:40.701
This some James Bond shit.

1058
00:56:40.919 --> 00:56:41.833
How'd you get this?

1059
00:56:41.833 --> 00:56:43.225
James Bond?

1060
00:56:43.356 --> 00:56:44.705
You know what?

1061
00:56:44.836 --> 00:56:46.577
You're gonna need
to get off my boat.

1062
00:56:50.015 --> 00:56:51.016
Drisdale.

1063
00:56:51.016 --> 00:56:53.279
These guys continue
to be a problem.

1064
00:56:53.366 --> 00:56:55.194
Three of them just
tried to kill me.

1065
00:56:55.281 --> 00:56:56.848
Are they dead?

1066
00:56:56.935 --> 00:56:58.719
Did you find out anything
on those two names?

1067
00:56:58.850 --> 00:56:59.720
Yes I did.

1068
00:56:59.851 --> 00:57:01.896
These are very bad people.

1069
00:57:02.027 --> 00:57:02.897
How bad?

1070
00:57:03.028 --> 00:57:06.118
Well Donnie Iger is
the guy who it seems

1071
00:57:06.248 --> 00:57:08.425
your little girl
stole the drive from.

1072
00:57:08.512 --> 00:57:09.687
She didn't steal anything.

1073
00:57:09.817 --> 00:57:11.689
This drive landed in
her lap from her husband

1074
00:57:11.689 --> 00:57:13.908
who didn't look both ways
before he crossed the street.

1075
00:57:14.039 --> 00:57:15.432
Well he looked both ways

1076
00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:16.911
when he decided to
work with Donnie.

1077
00:57:17.042 --> 00:57:19.653
I mean he is a
lifelong piece of shit.

1078
00:57:19.653 --> 00:57:21.699
He did seven years hard time.

1079
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:24.528
but when he came out
he spent the next

1080
00:57:24.658 --> 00:57:27.705
10 years working his
way up the membership.

1081
00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:29.924
Organised crime.

1082
00:57:30.098 --> 00:57:32.144
Yep. and Matt.
let me tell you.

1083
00:57:32.318 --> 00:57:34.929
These guys are into everything.

1084
00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:40.108
Drugs. human trafficking.
money laundering. firearms.

1085
00:57:40.805 --> 00:57:45.984
cyber crimes. and Donnie runs
a small arm of the membership.

1086
00:57:46.506 --> 00:57:51.468
His boss is one Hector Garcia.

1087
00:57:57.082 --> 00:58:00.564
♪ Well I walk that walk

1088
00:58:00.694 --> 00:58:04.350
♪ And talk that talk ♪

1089
00:58:04.524 --> 00:58:07.658
♪ Said you're so fine ♪

1090
00:58:07.658 --> 00:58:10.965
♪ Said you'll be mine

1091
00:58:11.139 --> 00:58:12.750
♪ And we'll talk that talk ♪

1092
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:14.621
I apologise if I
kept you waiting.

1093
00:58:18.233 --> 00:58:19.583
Have you not eaten?

1094
00:58:19.713 --> 00:58:21.367
Oh please. eat something.

1095
00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:24.979
No. no I'm fine.

1096
00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:26.807
Thank you. Mrs. Garcia.

1097
00:58:26.894 --> 00:58:31.508
Oh please. oh my
goodness. call me Hector.

1098
00:58:37.514 --> 00:58:40.125
You work for me. yes?

1099
00:58:40.255 --> 00:58:41.430
Yes.

1100
00:58:41.561 --> 00:58:42.867
And forgive me. you are...

1101
00:58:42.954 --> 00:58:44.172
Helen.

1102
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:46.305
No no. not your name.
what you do for me.

1103
00:58:46.392 --> 00:58:47.741
You are...

1104
00:58:47.828 --> 00:58:48.873
I'm sorry.

1105
00:58:50.744 --> 00:58:51.789
I'm an...

1106
00:58:52.616 --> 00:58:53.878
I'm an accountant.

1107
00:58:55.967 --> 00:58:57.316
Yes.

1108
00:58:57.403 --> 00:58:58.273
That's it.

1109
00:59:00.928 --> 00:59:02.495
Helen. come with me.

1110
00:59:12.592 --> 00:59:15.682
Helen. do you know of a
company called AJ Boat Carters?

1111
00:59:17.075 --> 00:59:19.338
AJ Boat Carters is not
actually a boat company.

1112
00:59:19.425 --> 00:59:21.340
it's just a front to move cash.

1113
00:59:21.427 --> 00:59:22.776
Do you know this?

1114
00:59:23.734 --> 00:59:27.520
Do you know about the $16.246.87

1115
00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:29.783
that has moved
into that company?

1116
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:30.784
I'm sorry.

1117
00:59:32.307 --> 00:59:34.222
Mrs. Garcia. please.

1118
00:59:34.396 --> 00:59:35.833
I'm so sorry. I was stupid.

1119
00:59:35.963 --> 00:59:36.703
Come with me.

1120
00:59:37.922 --> 00:59:38.749
Oh God.

1121
00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:50.151
Beer?

1122
00:59:50.238 --> 00:59:51.326
No thank you.

1123
00:59:53.981 --> 00:59:56.767
You know. this would be.

1124
00:59:56.767 --> 00:59:59.465
The part
in the movie where

1125
00:59:59.552 --> 01:00:03.121
I tell you not to be
so hard on your dad.

1126
01:00:04.688 --> 01:00:06.603
'Cause he's got some
good qualities too.

1127
01:00:07.778 --> 01:00:09.997
Yeah. the ol' pal comes to
his buddy's rescue routine.

1128
01:00:10.432 --> 01:00:11.912
Classic.

1129
01:00:11.912 --> 01:00:15.046
Not really. but I
know he was hurting

1130
01:00:15.307 --> 01:00:16.917
being apart from your guys.

1131
01:00:18.223 --> 01:00:20.355
So what. my dad's
like Rambo or something?

1132
01:00:22.053 --> 01:00:23.924
Not quite Rambo. but your dad

1133
01:00:24.055 --> 01:00:27.624
used to have a very
special talent.

1134
01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.323
He was what we called a sneak.

1135
01:00:31.453 --> 01:00:33.020
Whenever there was
someone we couldn't get to

1136
01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:37.155
for one reason or another
they'd send in your dad.

1137
01:00:37.285 --> 01:00:39.418
My dad's an assassin isn't he?

1138
01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:45.424
Never came from me. but yeah.

1139
01:00:45.511 --> 01:00:47.252
Your dad's totally an assassin.

1140
01:00:47.382 --> 01:00:48.645
Are you shitting me?

1141
01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.124
No. no. not really.

1142
01:00:50.298 --> 01:00:54.433
He had this unique ability
to get in unnoticed.

1143
01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.696
get the job done. and get out.

1144
01:00:57.958 --> 01:01:01.701
When he killed those
guys and watched them die.

1145
01:01:02.093 --> 01:01:04.704
and don't get me wrong.
they were bad guys.

1146
01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:08.186
but it was like it
didn't even affect him.

1147
01:01:08.316 --> 01:01:11.537
It was like he was just
taking the trash to the curb.

1148
01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.108
When I was a boy my
father had a heart attack.

1149
01:01:17.195 --> 01:01:19.676
And later that night
he was recovering

1150
01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:20.851
in the emergency ward.

1151
01:01:20.851 --> 01:01:23.157
I was sitting right by his side

1152
01:01:23.288 --> 01:01:26.378
when they two doctors rushed in.

1153
01:01:26.508 --> 01:01:28.423
Because the guy in
the bed next to my dad

1154
01:01:28.554 --> 01:01:30.556
was going into cardiac arrest.

1155
01:01:30.556 --> 01:01:33.864
Now they came in. but
they couldn't save him.

1156
01:01:33.864 --> 01:01:36.257
And he died right
there in front of us.

1157
01:01:37.215 --> 01:01:41.523
Now I certainly never
seen a man die before.

1158
01:01:41.523 --> 01:01:44.222
We just stood there.

1159
01:01:44.352 --> 01:01:46.572
Stunned.

1160
01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:50.097
Then. and I will
never forget this.

1161
01:01:50.097 --> 01:01:52.709
I heard one doctor
ask the other doctor

1162
01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:56.538
if he knew who won
the Dodgers game.

1163
01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:57.496
Baseball?

1164
01:01:58.584 --> 01:02:00.368
How can they be talking
baseball when a man

1165
01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:02.327
had just died right
in front of them?

1166
01:02:03.371 --> 01:02:04.895
That's when I knew.

1167
01:02:05.025 --> 01:02:08.986
The more death you've seen.
the less it affects you.

1168
01:02:08.986 --> 01:02:11.423
And I think your
dad has seen so much

1169
01:02:11.553 --> 01:02:15.383
that any effect it may
have had is long gone.

1170
01:02:16.558 --> 01:02:18.169
Please.

1171
01:02:34.011 --> 01:02:34.881
Oh God.

1172
01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.057
Please.

1173
01:02:37.188 --> 01:02:38.755
Please please don't do this.

1174
01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.626
Pull yourself together.

1175
01:02:41.627 --> 01:02:42.497
Look again.

1176
01:02:48.286 --> 01:02:49.983
Are you going to be loyal?

1177
01:02:50.157 --> 01:02:51.158
Yes.

1178
01:02:51.158 --> 01:02:52.769
Do you love your daughters?

1179
01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:54.422
Yes.

1180
01:02:54.553 --> 01:02:55.510
Of course you do.

1181
01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:59.210
Then they should be
fine without a father.

1182
01:03:02.387 --> 01:03:04.128
No!

1183
01:03:05.303 --> 01:03:07.087
Shh. shh-shh-shh-shh.

1184
01:03:08.523 --> 01:03:11.265
If you steal from me again.
you and your daughters

1185
01:03:11.396 --> 01:03:13.572
will be on that boat and
they will go in first.

1186
01:03:13.877 --> 01:03:15.313
Do you understand?

1187
01:03:18.098 --> 01:03:19.143
Yes.

1188
01:03:21.406 --> 01:03:24.670
Please feel free to take
some fruit home to your girls.

1189
01:03:24.757 --> 01:03:26.454
I'll have someone
prepare a basket.

1190
01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.240
It's no bother.

1191
01:03:29.327 --> 01:03:31.808
This woman is not to
be messed with. Matt.

1192
01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.332
She has very powerful friends.

1193
01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:40.686
Tell John to push
our lunch next week.

1194
01:03:40.773 --> 01:03:42.688
And I want specifics
on the mayor meeting.

1195
01:03:42.775 --> 01:03:44.342
I don't want another
incident with that woman.

1196
01:03:44.472 --> 01:03:45.256
I'm on it.

1197
01:03:50.652 --> 01:03:51.566
Everyone out.

1198
01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:55.919
What should I
tell the Sheffields?

1199
01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:57.616
Tell them I'll throw in
use of the private jet.

1200
01:03:57.703 --> 01:03:59.096
But that's it.

1201
01:03:59.226 --> 01:04:01.489
I need their support publicly.

1202
01:04:01.794 --> 01:04:02.839
Now go.

1203
01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.492
And close the door
on your way out.

1204
01:04:04.579 --> 01:04:06.103
Make sure I'm not disturbed.

1205
01:04:13.023 --> 01:04:14.024
I thought we had
an understanding

1206
01:04:14.024 --> 01:04:15.503
you would not contact me here.

1207
01:04:15.677 --> 01:04:17.375
The drive
has been stolen.

1208
01:04:19.812 --> 01:04:21.509
I'm gonna have to
ask you to repeat that.

1209
01:04:21.727 --> 01:04:23.294
The drive
has been stolen.

1210
01:04:23.424 --> 01:04:24.861
How?

1211
01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.514
I have
it under control.

1212
01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:27.951
Yeah. I think you and I have

1213
01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:29.822
two different definitions
of "under control".

1214
01:04:29.822 --> 01:04:31.650
I'll get the drive.

1215
01:04:31.737 --> 01:04:32.607
How?

1216
01:04:34.392 --> 01:04:36.350
What about your
man on the inside?

1217
01:04:36.524 --> 01:04:38.396
I think we can both
agree on one thing.

1218
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.051
It is in our mutual interest
to recover the drive

1219
01:04:41.051 --> 01:04:44.445
and I can assure you I
have my best men on it.

1220
01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:46.012
Well that's a relief.

1221
01:04:47.318 --> 01:04:49.537
Does anyone know
what's on that drive?

1222
01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:50.625
No.

1223
01:04:50.843 --> 01:04:51.888
Where are your men now?

1224
01:05:03.856 --> 01:05:06.250
You heading down for
the Blackbeard festival?

1225
01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:10.863
- Yarrgh!
-  Yarrgh!

1226
01:05:12.517 --> 01:05:13.518
Enjoy your flight.

1227
01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:20.917
I think we got a problem.

1228
01:05:21.134 --> 01:05:23.310
I'm calling you for a solution.

1229
01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.359
Purpose of your visit?

1230
01:05:28.576 --> 01:05:30.187
Business or pleasure?

1231
01:05:30.317 --> 01:05:31.492
Business.

1232
01:05:47.378 --> 01:05:48.422
So you remember
when you first rolled

1233
01:05:48.553 --> 01:05:50.120
you wanted a seven
but you didn't get it?

1234
01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:51.382
- Yeah.
- All right.

1235
01:05:51.382 --> 01:05:55.038
so now if you
roll a seven it's game over.

1236
01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:57.214
For everybody. whether
they bet on you or not.

1237
01:05:57.301 --> 01:05:59.433
So everybody's cheering
you on to not roll a seven.

1238
01:05:59.433 --> 01:06:03.960
You roll any other number.
everybody who bets on you wins.

1239
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.178
And you keep rolling.

1240
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:06.266
Okay.

1241
01:06:06.397 --> 01:06:07.441
Who are you gonna bet on?

1242
01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:08.790
Well I'm thinking
you're a shooter.

1243
01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:10.705
so I'm betting on you. kid.

1244
01:06:14.187 --> 01:06:15.623
Ooh!

1245
01:06:15.754 --> 01:06:16.624
You're a natural.

1246
01:06:16.755 --> 01:06:17.712
Roll again.

1247
01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:23.892
My God. she's en fuego.

1248
01:06:24.023 --> 01:06:25.764
We're going to Vegas
when this is over.

1249
01:06:25.851 --> 01:06:27.287
All right. numb nuts.

1250
01:06:40.213 --> 01:06:41.345
I didn't get a gun.

1251
01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:47.003
The fuck am I gonna
do with this thing?

1252
01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:49.092
Stick it up your ass.

1253
01:06:49.222 --> 01:06:50.441
Hey.

1254
01:06:50.615 --> 01:06:52.486
What's going on with
our pal Othello?

1255
01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.488
Why does Othello
trust Iago so much

1256
01:06:54.619 --> 01:06:56.490
when it's pretty
obvious to everyone

1257
01:06:56.621 --> 01:06:59.145
around him that Iago is lying?

1258
01:07:00.668 --> 01:07:02.322
How does he not see it?

1259
01:07:02.453 --> 01:07:03.541
I don't know.

1260
01:07:03.671 --> 01:07:04.846
It's always the
ones closest to you

1261
01:07:04.977 --> 01:07:07.240
get you in the end. you know?

1262
01:07:07.414 --> 01:07:08.459
Go ahead. roll.

1263
01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:13.420
Ah. you bust.

1264
01:07:16.467 --> 01:07:17.816
Be right back.

1265
01:07:18.991 --> 01:07:20.079
Hey boss.

1266
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:22.255
Yeah. she's with me.

1267
01:07:22.342 --> 01:07:25.128
All right. I'll send
you the address.

1268
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.436
All right. we got this fuck.

1269
01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:30.394
Head east.

1270
01:07:32.874 --> 01:07:35.007
East. don't make me
fucking say it again.

1271
01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:36.226
I don't know which way's east.

1272
01:07:36.226 --> 01:07:37.401
Left. do you know
which way's left?

1273
01:07:37.488 --> 01:07:38.358
Yeah.

1274
01:07:54.592 --> 01:07:56.594
I'm at work.

1275
01:07:56.594 --> 01:07:58.683
Maybe it's time you got
your priorities straight.

1276
01:07:58.813 --> 01:08:00.076
You made a promise to me

1277
01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:02.034
that you have yet
to materialise on.

1278
01:08:02.252 --> 01:08:04.080
Take the drive from
that neanderthal

1279
01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:06.604
Donnie and shut him down.

1280
01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:09.085
Every time we send our men
some old guy kills them.

1281
01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:11.783
This isn't just some old guy.

1282
01:08:11.913 --> 01:08:14.742
He's ex-Special Ops. he
used to work for my boss.

1283
01:08:14.916 --> 01:08:16.179
You're not gonna believe this.

1284
01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:19.138
but he's the father-in-law
of my snitch.

1285
01:08:19.138 --> 01:08:21.184
I'm lost. the old
guy that's killing my men?

1286
01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:24.883
Yes. he's a major badass
you want to avoid at all cost.

1287
01:08:36.547 --> 01:08:38.418
All right. where's
this motherfucker?

1288
01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:41.378
That blue one over there.

1289
01:08:41.378 --> 01:08:44.511
Ashley. the old man. and I
don't know. some other guy.

1290
01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:45.991
All right.

1291
01:08:46.078 --> 01:08:46.905
Here. get rid of her.

1292
01:08:50.474 --> 01:08:52.084
Boss.

1293
01:08:52.954 --> 01:08:54.130
Maybe we keep her
around. you know?

1294
01:08:54.217 --> 01:08:55.783
Just in case
circumstances change?

1295
01:08:55.957 --> 01:08:58.873
Why the fuck does everybody
make me say things twice?

1296
01:09:00.353 --> 01:09:03.226
Just get rid of her. all right?

1297
01:09:13.236 --> 01:09:13.801
Save me the suspense.

1298
01:09:13.932 --> 01:09:14.889
What are we dealing with?

1299
01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.456
All right.

1300
01:09:16.587 --> 01:09:17.588
You know Rambo?

1301
01:09:17.675 --> 01:09:18.632
So he's Rambo.

1302
01:09:18.763 --> 01:09:20.025
No. I'm pretty sure this guy

1303
01:09:20.025 --> 01:09:22.245
taught Rambo
everything he knows.

1304
01:09:22.245 --> 01:09:25.030
He won the Silver Star
for bravery twice.

1305
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:26.858
That hasn't been done
since World War II.

1306
01:09:26.988 --> 01:09:27.946
Well Donnie and
his men are about

1307
01:09:28.033 --> 01:09:29.339
to permanently retire him.

1308
01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:31.776
Listen to me very carefully.

1309
01:09:31.776 --> 01:09:33.952
This is not a man to
be messed with. okay?

1310
01:09:34.039 --> 01:09:35.519
He's a killing machine.

1311
01:09:37.042 --> 01:09:39.131
If he's got the drive
you're gonna need leverage.

1312
01:09:39.131 --> 01:09:40.350
Use the daughter.

1313
01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:41.960
Do not engage.

1314
01:09:42.047 --> 01:09:44.267
That might be too late.

1315
01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:48.358
Fuck.

1316
01:09:53.232 --> 01:09:56.453
For fuck's sake.
get back. get back.

1317
01:09:56.583 --> 01:09:58.846
Motherfucker.

1318
01:09:58.977 --> 01:10:00.457
All right. listen.

1319
01:10:00.457 --> 01:10:02.459
First thing is don't fucking
kill anybody all right?

1320
01:10:02.589 --> 01:10:04.200
I need them all alive.

1321
01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.289
Especially that fucking old man.

1322
01:10:06.419 --> 01:10:08.465
The most important thing is that

1323
01:10:08.595 --> 01:10:10.380
motherfucking hard
drive. all right?

1324
01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.382
I can't stress that enough.

1325
01:10:12.382 --> 01:10:14.993
We get that drive back.
we'll kill them all.

1326
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:15.994
All right?

1327
01:10:15.994 --> 01:10:17.300
We're gonna surround them.

1328
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:20.216
We're gonna trap them.
It's that easy.

1329
01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.565
Yeah. that's a good plan.

1330
01:10:24.437 --> 01:10:26.091
All right. you three.

1331
01:10:26.091 --> 01:10:28.528
Sneak to the far side.
come in from that side.

1332
01:10:28.659 --> 01:10:30.095
You three. go around.

1333
01:10:30.095 --> 01:10:32.837
Sneak in from the
other side. all right?

1334
01:10:32.837 --> 01:10:35.492
Guys. they got
nowhere fucking to go.

1335
01:10:35.622 --> 01:10:37.581
We got them.
Go go go go go.

1336
01:10:42.281 --> 01:10:43.587
Get back. get back.

1337
01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:49.680
They found us.

1338
01:10:49.767 --> 01:10:50.942
You got any weapons on board?

1339
01:10:51.072 --> 01:10:53.074
Oh my God.
How did they find us?

1340
01:10:53.074 --> 01:10:54.250
Weapons like guns?

1341
01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.512
That'd be good.

1342
01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:04.695
Would this even kill someone?

1343
01:11:04.782 --> 01:11:07.350
I doubt it.
Might set them on fire.

1344
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:08.742
I'll tell you what though.
if you shoot somebody

1345
01:11:08.873 --> 01:11:10.918
up close with that thing
it'll severely slow them down.

1346
01:11:11.702 --> 01:11:13.356
You need to hide
her somewhere.

1347
01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:15.227
I got the place.

1348
01:11:20.145 --> 01:11:21.059
I'm not going down there.

1349
01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:22.539
Ashley.

1350
01:11:26.369 --> 01:11:27.892
Don't come out until
I come back for you.

1351
01:11:40.687 --> 01:11:43.124
Are you gonna kill my
mommy and grand daddy?

1352
01:11:43.342 --> 01:11:45.126
Nah. I just want to talk.

1353
01:11:47.128 --> 01:11:49.566
You know. my daddy
always says if someone's

1354
01:11:49.696 --> 01:11:50.784
not looking you in
the eye when they

1355
01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:52.308
give you answers it
means they're lying.

1356
01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:54.527
I just want to talk all right?

1357
01:11:54.527 --> 01:11:55.833
Come on. let's go.

1358
01:12:01.099 --> 01:12:02.187
Yo Ashley!

1359
01:12:04.363 --> 01:12:05.190
You in there?

1360
01:12:06.539 --> 01:12:07.975
Hey grandpa. you in there?

1361
01:12:08.106 --> 01:12:09.629
Grandpa?

1362
01:12:09.716 --> 01:12:11.283
I believe you have something
that was stolen from me!

1363
01:12:11.675 --> 01:12:14.591
I understand you have
something that belongs to me!

1364
01:12:14.591 --> 01:12:16.636
Yeah. I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about!

1365
01:12:16.767 --> 01:12:18.203
My granddaughter!

1366
01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:21.728
Soon as I know she's safe
I'll give you what you need.

1367
01:12:22.773 --> 01:12:24.514
This look familiar?

1368
01:12:24.514 --> 01:12:26.472
Gotta get that fucking drive.

1369
01:12:28.082 --> 01:12:29.649
Hey yo!

1370
01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.347
Listen. let's just
calm down. all right?

1371
01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.349
We can work this out!

1372
01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:34.654
Tell you what!

1373
01:12:34.785 --> 01:12:36.221
I'm gonna send one
of my guys back

1374
01:12:36.308 --> 01:12:38.179
to get your
granddaughter. all right?

1375
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:39.355
Okay!

1376
01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:40.704
I can wait here.

1377
01:13:05.598 --> 01:13:06.730
Stay low.

1378
01:13:37.195 --> 01:13:38.762
Dad!

1379
01:13:44.898 --> 01:13:46.247
All right. stop here.

1380
01:13:49.642 --> 01:13:51.296
Turn around.

1381
01:13:53.254 --> 01:13:54.560
I said turn around.

1382
01:13:58.825 --> 01:14:01.219
- All right.
- Where is your code?

1383
01:14:01.306 --> 01:14:02.525
What?

1384
01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:03.874
Good guy or bad guy
you gave me your word.

1385
01:14:04.265 --> 01:14:05.658
And you promised.

1386
01:14:08.052 --> 01:14:10.707
I thought you had a code
of honour or something.

1387
01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:20.978
Jesus Christ.

1388
01:14:24.068 --> 01:14:25.330
Dad!

1389
01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:27.071
Please please please!

1390
01:14:32.424 --> 01:14:33.686
All right.

1391
01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:34.557
Let's go.

1392
01:14:38.822 --> 01:14:39.823
Hey!

1393
01:14:45.219 --> 01:14:46.264
Get back here!

1394
01:14:47.091 --> 01:14:48.266
Hey!

1395
01:14:48.353 --> 01:14:49.223
Goddammit!

1396
01:14:50.007 --> 01:14:51.835
Stay back.
stay back. stay back.

1397
01:14:55.447 --> 01:14:56.492
Don't move.

1398
01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.281
- Got you now mother-
- Grandpa!

1399
01:15:45.932 --> 01:15:47.064
Please!

1400
01:15:47.194 --> 01:15:48.413
Help me!

1401
01:15:48.413 --> 01:15:50.284
Dad!

1402
01:16:14.613 --> 01:16:15.440
Dad!

1403
01:16:16.789 --> 01:16:17.573
Mom?

1404
01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:19.357
Mom!

1405
01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:20.880
Sarah!

1406
01:16:21.011 --> 01:16:23.535
Save me!
Sarah I'm down here!

1407
01:16:23.535 --> 01:16:25.537
Mom?

1408
01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:27.234
Sarah open the hatch quick!

1409
01:16:27.365 --> 01:16:28.192
Baby!

1410
01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:42.206
Sarah please!

1411
01:16:42.336 --> 01:16:43.773
Open the hatch!

1412
01:16:43.773 --> 01:16:45.035
Baby!

1413
01:16:45.122 --> 01:16:46.906
He's coming!

1414
01:16:54.697 --> 01:16:58.135
You're almost there. just
keep trying for me okay?

1415
01:17:15.195 --> 01:17:16.588
Almost got it!

1416
01:17:18.068 --> 01:17:20.070
Come on baby. you can do it!

1417
01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.602
Mom he's here!

1418
01:17:31.864 --> 01:17:32.865
Mom!

1419
01:17:40.525 --> 01:17:42.222
Stay the fuck away
from my daughter!

1420
01:17:51.971 --> 01:17:54.757
Iago.

1421
01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:27.920
- Get in the boat.
- Fuck you.

1422
01:18:28.007 --> 01:18:29.879
Get in the fucking
boat or you die.

1423
01:18:36.537 --> 01:18:38.235
Get in the fucking boat!

1424
01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:41.368
Get in the boat.

1425
01:18:46.678 --> 01:18:47.897
Go!

1426
01:18:50.595 --> 01:18:51.727
Fucking get in the boat!

1427
01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.163
Please. no. please
please please

1428
01:18:53.337 --> 01:18:54.033
Get in the boat
or I'll kill her!

1429
01:18:54.164 --> 01:18:55.731
Please please please!

1430
01:19:26.326 --> 01:19:27.414
I've been shot.

1431
01:19:28.111 --> 01:19:29.068
Twice.

1432
01:19:29.199 --> 01:19:30.548
Let me get you to my truck.

1433
01:19:42.386 --> 01:19:43.691
Drisdale.

1434
01:19:43.822 --> 01:19:45.432
So who do these fuckers
known in the Caribbean?

1435
01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:47.043
-  What happened?
- Donnie and his crew happened.

1436
01:19:47.173 --> 01:19:49.001
10 of them.
They had a lot of firepower

1437
01:19:49.001 --> 01:19:51.177
and there's no way
they flew in with it.

1438
01:19:51.525 --> 01:19:53.266
- Are you okay?
- No.

1439
01:19:53.397 --> 01:19:55.529
He got away and he has my
daughter and my granddaughter.

1440
01:19:55.529 --> 01:19:56.792
I think he's gonna try and
get off the island with them.

1441
01:19:57.009 --> 01:19:58.794
-  How?
-  You tell me.

1442
01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:00.273
Look. there's no
way that he's gonna

1443
01:20:00.447 --> 01:20:02.058
get a woman and her
daughter off the island

1444
01:20:02.188 --> 01:20:04.756
as hostages with no
significant help.

1445
01:20:04.756 --> 01:20:06.149
Leave it with me.

1446
01:20:12.677 --> 01:20:13.896
Yeah.

1447
01:20:13.896 --> 01:20:15.593
It appears
Rambo's personal trainer

1448
01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.986
is just as good as you say.

1449
01:20:18.248 --> 01:20:19.815
Yeah. two no mustard please.

1450
01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.338
- Yep.
- I told you not to engage.

1451
01:20:21.338 --> 01:20:22.774
Did you engage?

1452
01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:25.690
Against council.
yes. and he was no letdown.

1453
01:20:25.995 --> 01:20:28.475
This guy didn't disappoint
after all your hype.

1454
01:20:28.693 --> 01:20:30.129
Damage?

1455
01:20:30.129 --> 01:20:31.348
He killed
10 of Donnie's men.

1456
01:20:31.478 --> 01:20:33.698
Jesus H.

1457
01:20:33.698 --> 01:20:35.091
Who's got the drive?

1458
01:20:35.091 --> 01:20:36.483
Your boy still
has it. but the good news

1459
01:20:36.657 --> 01:20:39.704
is Donnie made it out of
there with some insurance.

1460
01:20:39.791 --> 01:20:41.837
I need transport
off the island ASAP.

1461
01:20:43.055 --> 01:20:44.361
What?

1462
01:20:44.491 --> 01:20:47.277
If that drive
falls into the wrong hands

1463
01:20:47.364 --> 01:20:48.887
I can only imagine

1464
01:20:48.887 --> 01:20:51.368
the collateral damage
that will follow.

1465
01:20:51.498 --> 01:20:53.152
Are you threatening me?

1466
01:20:53.283 --> 01:20:54.284
Yes. of course.

1467
01:20:54.414 --> 01:20:56.373
I'm a criminal.

1468
01:20:56.503 --> 01:21:00.812
Get them off the island or
I will nail you to a cross

1469
01:21:00.812 --> 01:21:02.988
and you will learn
about sacrifice.

1470
01:21:08.124 --> 01:21:09.081
Okay.

1471
01:21:09.299 --> 01:21:10.213
No mustard right?

1472
01:21:12.345 --> 01:21:14.217
It's like you
don't even know me.

1473
01:21:14.304 --> 01:21:15.174
What?

1474
01:21:18.177 --> 01:21:19.178
"No mustard."

1475
01:21:19.309 --> 01:21:20.658
What is this. Russia?

1476
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:27.621
Sir.

1477
01:21:27.752 --> 01:21:30.711
No. I don't believe he's
aware of anything. sir.

1478
01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:35.412
Yes sir. I'm quite sure
he's feeding the intel.

1479
01:21:37.196 --> 01:21:38.110
I don't believe so.

1480
01:21:40.112 --> 01:21:42.898
You can count on me. sir.

1481
01:21:48.729 --> 01:21:49.730
Who was that?

1482
01:21:51.123 --> 01:21:52.385
My dad.

1483
01:21:52.559 --> 01:21:55.084
He's worried my mom's
gonna vote Republican.

1484
01:21:55.084 --> 01:21:56.694
Thank God my parents are dead.

1485
01:22:11.143 --> 01:22:12.101
I need help!

1486
01:22:12.231 --> 01:22:13.276
I need help!

1487
01:22:18.672 --> 01:22:20.979
- He has two gunshot wounds.
- Who are you?

1488
01:22:21.153 --> 01:22:22.154
I'm his friend.

1489
01:22:22.154 --> 01:22:23.155
You're gonna have to go inside

1490
01:22:23.155 --> 01:22:24.026
and report this to the police.

1491
01:22:24.113 --> 01:22:25.244
Of course.

1492
01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:27.159
I just gotta move my car
out of the emergency zone.

1493
01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:28.378
Quickly!

1494
01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:30.597
-  All right.
- Yeah. here we go.

1495
01:22:30.597 --> 01:22:32.730
-  That's it.
-  Yeah. I got your arm.

1496
01:22:33.165 --> 01:22:34.732
There you go. yeah.

1497
01:22:34.819 --> 01:22:35.689
Easy.

1498
01:22:39.171 --> 01:22:40.868
Well you were right.

1499
01:22:40.999 --> 01:22:43.393
Three flights just
left headed to Miami

1500
01:22:43.567 --> 01:22:46.135
and Donnie was spotted on
one of the cargo flights.

1501
01:22:46.135 --> 01:22:47.266
I think he must have gotten

1502
01:22:47.397 --> 01:22:49.051
your family on
that plane somehow

1503
01:22:49.138 --> 01:22:51.836
and he must have
some agency help.

1504
01:22:51.836 --> 01:22:53.316
Do you still have
the hard drive?

1505
01:22:53.316 --> 01:22:54.404
Yes.

1506
01:22:54.404 --> 01:22:56.058
There's a 6 PM flight.

1507
01:22:56.145 --> 01:22:59.931
I booked you on it. now I
cannot help you officially.

1508
01:22:59.931 --> 01:23:01.933
You understand that right?

1509
01:23:01.933 --> 01:23:03.152
Got it.

1510
01:23:03.152 --> 01:23:04.283
When you get to
Miami there'll be

1511
01:23:04.414 --> 01:23:06.590
a car there waiting for you.

1512
01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:07.634
Check the trunk.

1513
01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:08.853
Copy.

1514
01:23:12.465 --> 01:23:13.727
You think he bought it?

1515
01:23:15.425 --> 01:23:20.082
I think he is pissed off
and he wants his family back.

1516
01:23:20.082 --> 01:23:22.475
And you better have
your information right.

1517
01:23:22.649 --> 01:23:23.650
You saw the surveillance.

1518
01:23:23.824 --> 01:23:25.609
All three on their way to Miami.

1519
01:23:25.739 --> 01:23:28.873
I do not know how the hell
he got on that cargo flight.

1520
01:23:29.874 --> 01:23:31.180
I don't know.

1521
01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.443
This ends tonight.

1522
01:23:33.617 --> 01:23:34.661
I don't want any more surprises.

1523
01:23:34.835 --> 01:23:37.099
I'm sick of Hector
and her people

1524
01:23:37.186 --> 01:23:39.318
always being one
step ahead of us.

1525
01:23:39.449 --> 01:23:41.016
Well like you said. Chief.

1526
01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.801
I think she's got
someone on the inside.

1527
01:23:51.852 --> 01:23:53.767
May I offer you a
drink from the bar?

1528
01:23:55.073 --> 01:23:57.249
Double Absolut on the rocks.

1529
01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:58.163
Okay.

1530
01:24:02.254 --> 01:24:03.386
You're late!

1531
01:24:04.561 --> 01:24:06.998
This guy's file reads
like episodes of G.I. Joe.

1532
01:24:07.477 --> 01:24:09.044
Seen half of this stuff?

1533
01:24:09.131 --> 01:24:11.698
I wrote half of the reports.

1534
01:24:11.785 --> 01:24:13.874
He's a true blue
American hero.

1535
01:24:14.005 --> 01:24:16.268
Exactly what we need.

1536
01:24:16.268 --> 01:24:18.923
If he has the hard
drive. and Hector

1537
01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:22.144
has his granddaughter
and his daughter.

1538
01:24:22.274 --> 01:24:25.147
he's gonna do all the
heavy lifting for us

1539
01:24:25.147 --> 01:24:28.846
by removing Hector and her men.

1540
01:24:28.933 --> 01:24:30.587
Any update on the drop?

1541
01:24:30.717 --> 01:24:33.633
According to my source
it's at Hector's house.

1542
01:24:33.807 --> 01:24:35.070
After you.

1543
01:25:57.326 --> 01:25:59.763
Welcome to my home

1544
01:26:00.067 --> 01:26:02.157
I'm glad that you
both made it safely.

1545
01:26:03.810 --> 01:26:06.465
Although I will say that
the unforeseen circumstances

1546
01:26:06.596 --> 01:26:09.903
that brought you
here are unfortunate.

1547
01:26:12.210 --> 01:26:14.038
Oh don't be scared. Sarah.

1548
01:26:15.779 --> 01:26:18.042
I have absolutely no
intention of hurting you.

1549
01:26:19.696 --> 01:26:23.917
Your grandfather. however. I
cannot guarantee the safety of.

1550
01:26:26.398 --> 01:26:27.443
It's okay.

1551
01:26:30.402 --> 01:26:34.493
You do understand that
I cannot control Donnie.

1552
01:26:34.624 --> 01:26:36.930
I can only control
what side he's on.

1553
01:26:46.723 --> 01:26:50.248
Welcome
to Miami International Airport.

1554
01:26:50.248 --> 01:26:52.207
Please remember to
keep your belongings

1555
01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:54.470
with you at all times.

1556
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:58.952
All unattended baggage will
be confiscated immediately.

1557
01:27:12.444 --> 01:27:13.228
We all set?

1558
01:27:14.316 --> 01:27:16.405
Almost too easy.

1559
01:27:16.405 --> 01:27:17.493
Well good.

1560
01:27:18.668 --> 01:27:20.147
What's the ETA?

1561
01:27:20.278 --> 01:27:23.020
We touch down in
Miami in 13 minutes. ma'am.

1562
01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:07.847
Sarah.

1563
01:28:07.934 --> 01:28:10.459
Sarah get back here.

1564
01:28:10.459 --> 01:28:12.069
What are you doing?

1565
01:28:12.069 --> 01:28:14.071
Sarah come back over here.

1566
01:28:26.605 --> 01:28:27.432
Sarah!

1567
01:28:37.094 --> 01:28:38.400
I have an idea.

1568
01:28:58.202 --> 01:28:59.116
Whoa.

1569
01:28:59.377 --> 01:29:00.857
Is he gonna be okay?

1570
01:29:02.293 --> 01:29:03.816
It's too soon to tell.
Come on.

1571
01:29:03.947 --> 01:29:06.123
Come on come on come on.
Come on. quick.

1572
01:29:26.796 --> 01:29:27.753
Hey. what was that?

1573
01:29:27.884 --> 01:29:29.233
See anything?

1574
01:29:29.233 --> 01:29:31.104
All right. looks
like our boy's here.

1575
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:33.542
Go check on the girls.

1576
01:29:34.586 --> 01:29:35.935
You guys see anything?

1577
01:29:35.935 --> 01:29:36.806
No.

1578
01:29:38.895 --> 01:29:40.679
Hey. there!

1579
01:29:40.810 --> 01:29:42.159
It's coming!
Fire!

1580
01:29:48.644 --> 01:29:50.863
I thought you fucking
had this under control.

1581
01:29:51.037 --> 01:29:52.561
Get these lights back on.

1582
01:29:54.606 --> 01:29:56.173
- Get out of the car!

1583
01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:57.130
Hey!

1584
01:29:59.655 --> 01:30:01.178
Step out of the vehicle!

1585
01:30:01.265 --> 01:30:02.962
Get out of the car!

1586
01:30:03.963 --> 01:30:04.790
See anything?

1587
01:30:15.497 --> 01:30:18.587
Back
back back back back.

1588
01:30:18.717 --> 01:30:19.544
Shh.

1589
01:30:42.132 --> 01:30:45.178
When I call you answer.
you fucking prick.

1590
01:30:45.309 --> 01:30:47.311
Who do you think
you're fucking with?

1591
01:30:47.311 --> 01:30:51.576
I will cut your balls off and
feed them to my fucking dogs!

1592
01:30:52.838 --> 01:30:53.752
Fuck!

1593
01:31:10.987 --> 01:31:12.684
- Dad!
-  Grandpa!

1594
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:16.819
- Dad!
- Grandpa!

1595
01:31:31.964 --> 01:31:33.575
There's more men coming.

1596
01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.762
Just stop.

1597
01:31:49.852 --> 01:31:50.679
Come on.

1598
01:31:52.115 --> 01:31:52.594
Come on!

1599
01:32:55.961 --> 01:32:57.267
Shh. shh.

1600
01:32:57.484 --> 01:33:00.096
All right. sit on that
bench and do not move.

1601
01:33:07.886 --> 01:33:09.018
Fuck.

1602
01:33:09.105 --> 01:33:10.236
My grandpa's kicking
your butt out there.

1603
01:33:10.367 --> 01:33:11.760
- Sarah.
- Shut up.

1604
01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:12.978
Go kill that motherfucker.

1605
01:33:12.978 --> 01:33:14.153
What. are you
pissing your pants?

1606
01:33:14.327 --> 01:33:15.415
Huh Hector?

1607
01:33:15.502 --> 01:33:16.460
You want me to kill
that motherfucker?

1608
01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:18.418
- Shut the fuck up. Donnie.
- Fuck you.

1609
01:33:18.418 --> 01:33:19.594
All right. you want something
done you do it yourself.

1610
01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:20.464
Come here.

1611
01:33:24.033 --> 01:33:24.903
Watch them.

1612
01:33:41.267 --> 01:33:42.834
Drop the gun.

1613
01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.054
Drop the fucking gun!

1614
01:33:46.055 --> 01:33:47.404
Got you. motherfucker.

1615
01:33:47.491 --> 01:33:49.145
Hand me the hard drive.

1616
01:33:49.275 --> 01:33:50.799
Hand me the hard drive!

1617
01:33:50.799 --> 01:33:52.627
My finger's on the
fucking trigger.

1618
01:33:55.586 --> 01:33:56.413
All right.

1619
01:33:59.416 --> 01:34:00.243
Go.

1620
01:34:00.373 --> 01:34:01.200
Go.

1621
01:34:04.726 --> 01:34:07.511
You know. you killed
15 of my guys.

1622
01:34:07.685 --> 01:34:08.817
You know that right?
You motherfucker.

1623
01:34:08.817 --> 01:34:09.948
You killed my
little brother.

1624
01:34:10.079 --> 01:34:11.341
You know what I'm
gonna do first?

1625
01:34:11.471 --> 01:34:13.082
I'm gonna kill your
fucking family.

1626
01:34:13.256 --> 01:34:14.518
Right in front of your face.

1627
01:34:14.518 --> 01:34:16.128
That's right. do something. Move.

1628
01:34:16.259 --> 01:34:17.739
Go ahead. try to kick.

1629
01:34:17.739 --> 01:34:20.176
Try to do one of your fucking
fancy things. motherfucker.

1630
01:34:23.309 --> 01:34:24.397
Give me the drive.

1631
01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:29.620
Give me the goddamn

1632
01:34:36.322 --> 01:34:37.889
All right tough
guy. it's fucking

1633
01:34:39.761 --> 01:34:41.545
Don't move.

1634
01:34:50.902 --> 01:34:51.816
Give me the drive.

1635
01:34:57.648 --> 01:34:59.519
The real drive.

1636
01:35:05.743 --> 01:35:06.962
Well Chief.

1637
01:35:09.529 --> 01:35:10.356
You were right.

1638
01:35:22.238 --> 01:35:23.282
Thank you.

1639
01:35:25.589 --> 01:35:27.286
All of this for a little stick.

1640
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:31.856
May I borrow him for a moment?

1641
01:35:33.771 --> 01:35:35.077
Come. walk with me.

1642
01:35:36.382 --> 01:35:37.470
Trust him.

1643
01:35:42.171 --> 01:35:42.867
You badly hurt?

1644
01:35:44.303 --> 01:35:45.609
I'll heal.

1645
01:35:45.696 --> 01:35:47.089
Yeah
you do. don't you?

1646
01:35:48.481 --> 01:35:49.395
Are you hurt?

1647
01:35:49.613 --> 01:35:51.354
- No.
- I'm okay.

1648
01:35:51.484 --> 01:35:53.182
Is she hurt?

1649
01:35:53.356 --> 01:35:54.966
Just look at me. okay?

1650
01:35:54.966 --> 01:35:57.142
Okay. you're okay.

1651
01:35:57.142 --> 01:35:58.535
Very brave.

1652
01:35:58.622 --> 01:35:59.841
Brave little girl.

1653
01:35:59.971 --> 01:36:01.930
What the hell's
going on here. man?

1654
01:36:01.930 --> 01:36:04.193
Yes. I'm sure you
have lots of questions.

1655
01:36:04.846 --> 01:36:07.152
I saw some of what
was on that drive.

1656
01:36:07.152 --> 01:36:08.937
Goes pretty deep.

1657
01:36:09.024 --> 01:36:11.156
Where does it all lead?

1658
01:36:11.156 --> 01:36:13.768
Everywhere and nowhere.

1659
01:36:13.768 --> 01:36:14.769
Those are the kinds of answers

1660
01:36:14.856 --> 01:36:17.075
that make me despise authority.

1661
01:36:17.206 --> 01:36:18.468
We've been trying
to shut down Hector's

1662
01:36:18.598 --> 01:36:21.514
East Coast crime
organisation unit for years.

1663
01:36:21.645 --> 01:36:23.865
Jimmy. your son-in-law.
was informing for us.

1664
01:36:23.995 --> 01:36:25.649
About six months.

1665
01:36:25.736 --> 01:36:28.086
Well actually he was
informing Fitzsimmons.

1666
01:36:28.217 --> 01:36:30.523
And Fitzsimmons was
informing Hector.

1667
01:36:30.654 --> 01:36:32.221
So every time we got
close to busting Hector

1668
01:36:32.395 --> 01:36:35.311
and her operations Fitzsimmons
would feed her information.

1669
01:36:36.529 --> 01:36:38.053
When Fitzsimmons
found out that Donnie

1670
01:36:38.183 --> 01:36:41.012
had the drive. he used
Jimmy to steal it.

1671
01:36:42.187 --> 01:36:44.059
So he could get
it back to Hector.

1672
01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:46.061
His partner got
shot and the whole

1673
01:36:46.191 --> 01:36:47.584
operation went upside down.

1674
01:36:48.628 --> 01:36:50.108
Jimmy got caught.

1675
01:36:50.282 --> 01:36:51.893
The drive landed
on your doorstep.

1676
01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:57.463
When you reached out to
Drisdale that you had the drive

1677
01:36:57.550 --> 01:37:00.075
we figured you were the perfect
way to expose Fitzsimmons.

1678
01:37:00.205 --> 01:37:02.642
And wipe out Hector and her men.

1679
01:37:02.773 --> 01:37:04.340
So you used me.

1680
01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:05.907
Of course.

1681
01:37:06.037 --> 01:37:07.256
Why?

1682
01:37:07.386 --> 01:37:08.692
Politics.

1683
01:37:08.866 --> 01:37:11.216
I'm running for the Governor
of the state of Florida.

1684
01:37:11.695 --> 01:37:13.915
This drive gives me
the leverage I need.

1685
01:37:13.915 --> 01:37:16.700
Plus now that I've
taken down the entire

1686
01:37:16.787 --> 01:37:18.702
East Coast crime
organisation run by Hector

1687
01:37:18.789 --> 01:37:21.313
and her men. all I
have to do is hold

1688
01:37:21.487 --> 01:37:24.447
a press conference
and take credit.

1689
01:37:24.447 --> 01:37:26.362
Then I begin my run for office.

1690
01:37:27.885 --> 01:37:30.845
So you're gonna use that
drive for your own benefit.

1691
01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:32.324
Yes I am.

1692
01:37:32.498 --> 01:37:35.023
But isn't it reassuring to
know that we're the good guys?

1693
01:37:42.073 --> 01:37:43.292
What about them?

1694
01:37:43.466 --> 01:37:44.641
I just got my family back.

1695
01:37:44.728 --> 01:37:46.425
I'm not letting them go now.

1696
01:37:46.643 --> 01:37:48.297
They'll be taken care of.

1697
01:37:48.297 --> 01:37:49.951
You have my word.

1698
01:37:49.951 --> 01:37:52.649
When we're done here I'll
send them down to Cayman.

1699
01:37:52.736 --> 01:37:54.607
I can explain them. but not you.

1700
01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:56.696
Okay.

1701
01:37:58.307 --> 01:37:59.525
What about me?

1702
01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:02.267
Why don't you take this boat.

1703
01:38:03.225 --> 01:38:04.879
Hector won't be
needing it anymore.

1704
01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:08.186
Grand Cayman is about
380 nautical miles

1705
01:38:08.317 --> 01:38:09.274
in that direction.

1706
01:38:10.275 --> 01:38:12.321
What if I go to the press?

1707
01:38:12.495 --> 01:38:13.888
It's a pretty good story. no?

1708
01:38:18.109 --> 01:38:19.241
Fake news. my dear boy.

1709
01:38:20.285 --> 01:38:21.678
Fake news.

1710
01:38:42.873 --> 01:38:48.139
♪ Ooh the Milky Way has
gone a little sour ♪

1711
01:38:48.792 --> 01:38:53.928
♪ The leaves dried and
the flower fell away ♪
