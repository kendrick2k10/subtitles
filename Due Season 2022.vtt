Dad. you ain't
supposed to be back here.

11
00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:51.551
I couldn't let you go
on stage without this.

12
00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:54.241
Aw. Dad. I can't wear
that until I get in.

13
00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:56.758
It's bad luck.

14
00:00:56.793 --> 00:00:58.206
I hope you don't mind.

15
00:00:58.241 --> 00:00:59.310

What is this?

18
00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:04.517
No way.

19
00:01:11.517 --> 00:01:13.241
Shut the front door!

20
00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:14.275

Can we afford this?

25
00:01:20.137 --> 00:01:21.206
Can we afford this?

26
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:23.793
Don't you worry about that.

27
00:01:23.827 --> 00:01:26.689
Your future has always been
my mission and nothing else.

28
00:01:26.724 --> 00:01:29.896
Dad. I promise you. when I get
famous. I'm gonna pay you back.

29
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:34.206
Baby girl. this is not
about fame or fortune.

30
00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:35.482
It's about you.

31
00:01:35.517 --> 00:01:36.862
This is what that's about.

32
00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:42.137
Dad. Dad. you're
getting blood on it.

33
00:01:42.172 --> 00:01:43.206
You're getting blood on it.

34

You're getting blood on it.

35
00:01:44.482 --> 00:01:46.413
I'm not as coordinated
as I used to be.

36
00:01:46.448 --> 00:01:48.413

You know. that's one of
my my favorite songs.

Does your dad need
copies of these?

75
00:03:44.793 --> 00:03:49.827
My dad's-- oh.

76
00:03:53.517 --> 00:03:54.896
He's a hunk.

77
00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:55.827
A hunk of what?

78
00:03:58.482 --> 00:04:01.551
Just take these down the hall
to admissions. and you're done.

79
00:04:34.517 --> 00:04:35.448
Oh my gosh!

80
00:04:35.482 --> 00:04:36.551

00:04:42.413 --> 00:04:43.827
It's crazy.

87
00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:48.758
Come in.

88
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:53.655
Can I help you?

89
00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:55.896
So I see you got the memo.

90
00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:57.689
You got jokes?

91
00:04:57.724 --> 00:04:59.586
Yo. that was Sir the Baptist?

92
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.034
Better known as
the Bryan Moore.

93
00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:02.551
Yeah.

94
00:05:02.586 --> 00:05:04.551
He adjuncts here.

95
00:05:04.586 --> 00:05:06.482
Wow.

96
00:05:06.517 --> 00:05:08.655
So you mean I could actually
be in a class taught by him?

97
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.517
Mm. it depends on
how good you are.

98
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:13.517
The Bryan Moore?

99
00:05:13.551 --> 00:05:14.724
Yeah.

100
00:05:14.758 --> 00:05:15.965
He's teaching college kids?

101
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.793
Well. you know he
doesn't just teach.

102
00:05:17.827 --> 00:05:19.034
Mr. Moore completely
transformed our school

103
00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:20.965
into an international
music school where

104
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.793
everybody wants to
come. especially

105
00:05:22.827 --> 00:05:25.000
those of the female persuasion.

106
00:05:28.068 --> 00:05:28.689
You a student?

107
00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:30.620
Yeah. Cyrus.

108
00:05:30.655 --> 00:05:31.931
But everybody calls me Junior.

109
00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:33.103
OK. Vicky.

110
00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:34.448
I'm a sophomore.

111
00:05:34.482 --> 00:05:35.482
Yeah.

112
00:05:35.517 --> 00:05:38.103
I was sent down here by cougar.

113
00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:39.793
Everybody knows who
you're talking about too.

114
00:05:39.827 --> 00:05:41.517
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

115
00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:43.103
Like. is she the reason why
it's so old school in here.

116
00:05:43.137 --> 00:05:44.931
with the forms and
photos and everything?

117
00:05:44.965 --> 00:05:45.586
No. mm-mm.

118
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.896
Is there an app?

119
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:48.482
No.

120
00:05:48.517 --> 00:05:49.896
Chancellor Davis likes to
keep things old school.

121
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:51.413
Is part of the
allure of Prestige.

122
00:05:51.448 --> 00:05:52.655
I mean. looking around.
and you see everything

123
00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:54.000
here is state of the art.
- Yeah.

124
00:05:54.034 --> 00:05:56.724
Everything except
for us laborers.

125
00:05:56.758 --> 00:05:58.379
Is that Jocko over there?

126
00:05:58.413 --> 00:05:59.724
Mm-hmm.

127
00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:01.689
Whoa.

128
00:06:01.724 --> 00:06:03.103
Slow down. OK?

129
00:06:03.137 --> 00:06:04.896
Those celebrities just come
out to crown the winner.

130
00:06:04.931 --> 00:06:06.068
Is that the winner?

131
00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:06.931
Yeah.

132
00:06:06.965 --> 00:06:09.172
He's opening up
for Major Life now.

133
00:06:09.206 --> 00:06:11.931
One Music Fest. and
this is what happens.

134
00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:13.206
Hmm.

135
00:06:13.241 --> 00:06:15.551
ROBERT
This is not about fame.

136
00:06:15.586 --> 00:06:16.827
For sure.

137
00:06:16.862 --> 00:06:18.103
Gotta be in it to win it.

138
00:06:18.137 --> 00:06:19.103
Yeah.

139
00:06:19.137 --> 00:06:23.068
Um. you actually skipped
a part on section 3.

140
00:06:36.241 --> 00:06:37.448
Cool.

141
00:06:37.482 --> 00:06:40.172
Um. hang tight.

142
00:06:58.551 --> 00:06:59.793
Mitch. I know. man.

143
00:06:59.827 --> 00:07:01.586
MITCH Geo?

144
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.931
Huh?

145
00:07:02.965 --> 00:07:04.655
One of the celebrity
judges for the sing off.

146
00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:05.724
Geo?

147
00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:07.275
Get out of here. yo.

148
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.034
MITCH I'm looking
at the paperwork right now.

149
00:07:09.068 --> 00:07:11.689
It's a chance to take this back.

150
00:07:11.724 --> 00:07:12.827
Fore!

151
00:07:12.862 --> 00:07:14.758
Wait. he showed you?

152
00:07:14.793 --> 00:07:19.172
Well. he asked me to make
some copies. and I read them.

153
00:07:19.206 --> 00:07:21.034
All right. you shouldn't
be telling people.

154
00:07:21.068 --> 00:07:21.931
People?

155
00:07:21.965 --> 00:07:24.862
You're my only friend.
so don't worry.

156
00:07:24.896 --> 00:07:26.137
I think the secret is safe.

157
00:07:26.172 --> 00:07:27.310
Listen.

158
00:07:27.344 --> 00:07:29.517
For the last time. we were
orientation partners. OK?

159
00:07:29.551 --> 00:07:31.172
That was the extent
of our friendship.

160
00:07:31.206 --> 00:07:32.931
Now. stop yapping about Geo
before you get in trouble.

161
00:07:32.965 --> 00:07:34.862
I'm his student liaison.

162
00:07:34.896 --> 00:07:37.931
I can't get in trouble.

163
00:07:37.965 --> 00:07:39.137
Oh my god. he's coming.

164
00:07:39.172 --> 00:07:40.034
Bye.

165
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:50.172
Really?

166
00:07:56.931 --> 00:07:58.931
Bustling with activity.

167
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.896
What a special place.

168
00:08:03.931 --> 00:08:05.724
Listen. Mitch.

169
00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:09.655
Do you know why you were
selected for this position?

170
00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:10.724
Hard work?

171
00:08:10.758 --> 00:08:11.931
Determination?

172
00:08:11.965 --> 00:08:14.068
Because you follow the rules.

173
00:08:14.103 --> 00:08:17.655
So the next time I hear
of you leaking information

174
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:21.586
about the Music Fest. well.
you'll be singing wee.

175
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.827
wee. wee all the way home.

176
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.206
Yes. sir.

177
00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:29.758
Sorry.

178
00:08:29.793 --> 00:08:31.620
I just got excited.

179
00:08:31.655 --> 00:08:34.620
You see. Prestige was
built on a foundation

180
00:08:34.655 --> 00:08:37.689
of honor and character.

181
00:08:37.724 --> 00:08:39.103
Schools around the nation--

182
00:08:39.137 --> 00:08:41.068
well. they have
lowered their bars.

183
00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:43.724
sacrificing their standards.

184
00:08:43.758 --> 00:08:45.310
But not here.

185
00:08:45.344 --> 00:08:49.793
You see. for 200 years.
our musical elite

186
00:08:49.827 --> 00:08:52.034
has passed the torch.

187
00:08:52.068 --> 00:08:57.000
And now it's my job to
carry it. to protect it.

188
00:08:57.034 --> 00:09:00.724
and to pass it on to
the next chancellor.

189
00:09:00.758 --> 00:09:06.241
So you see. there's no room for
anything less than excellence.

190
00:09:16.172 --> 00:09:17.413
It was so
nice to meet you.

191
00:09:17.448 --> 00:09:18.827
Very nice meeting
you. and good luck.

192
00:09:18.862 --> 00:09:21.034
Thank you.

193
00:09:21.068 --> 00:09:21.689
Hey.

194
00:09:21.724 --> 00:09:22.724
Hey.

195
00:09:22.758 --> 00:09:23.655
You're back early.

196
00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:25.827
Yep.

197
00:09:25.862 --> 00:09:27.931
How was the tour
of the campus?

198
00:09:27.965 --> 00:09:29.000
It was incredible.

199
00:09:29.034 --> 00:09:30.000
Sir the Baptist adjuncts there.

200
00:09:30.034 --> 00:09:32.000
Can you believe it?

201
00:09:32.034 --> 00:09:34.689
After two years at the
JC. you were right.

202
00:09:34.724 --> 00:09:35.655
I'm ready.

203
00:09:35.689 --> 00:09:36.793
Uncle Blake's here.

204
00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:38.034
Oh my god.

205
00:09:38.068 --> 00:09:39.137
It's good to see you. Vicky.

206
00:09:39.172 --> 00:09:40.000
You too.

207
00:09:45.137 --> 00:09:48.000
What is going on here?

208
00:09:48.034 --> 00:09:50.896
We were just discussing
needs for the house.

209
00:09:50.931 --> 00:09:52.862
Nothing's definite yet.

210
00:09:52.896 --> 00:09:55.344
Your Uncle Blake
walked by the sign.

211
00:09:55.379 --> 00:09:57.827
said we could
discuss a possibility

212
00:09:57.862 --> 00:09:59.413
of selling the house.

213
00:09:59.448 --> 00:10:01.896
Baby. I can't afford this house
without your father being here.

214
00:10:01.931 --> 00:10:03.137
It's overwhelming.

215
00:10:03.172 --> 00:10:06.689
Vicky. baby. come on in here.

216
00:10:06.724 --> 00:10:08.068
Now. look.

217
00:10:08.103 --> 00:10:09.793
There's some things you
don't need to worry about.

218
00:10:09.827 --> 00:10:11.000
We've got this.

219
00:10:14.689 --> 00:10:20.034
Blake. I've known you
since you were Vicky's age.

220
00:10:20.068 --> 00:10:22.034
And the only time you
show up around here

221
00:10:22.068 --> 00:10:24.655
is if I'm cooking a chicken
or baking a bundt cake.

222
00:10:24.689 --> 00:10:26.137
Mm-hmm.

223
00:10:26.172 --> 00:10:29.103
And I ain't never seen you
leave a cookie untouched.

224
00:10:29.137 --> 00:10:31.137
not even after Robert's funeral.

225
00:10:34.724 --> 00:10:35.275
So what's itching you?

226
00:10:43.344 --> 00:10:45.310
There's an issue with
Robert's insurance.

227
00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:47.172
No. don't know
tell me that. Black.

228
00:10:47.206 --> 00:10:49.275
You advised us to dip
into the little bit

229
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.000
that we have for
Vicky's education

230
00:10:52.034 --> 00:10:54.034
until the insurance
claim was processed.

231
00:10:54.068 --> 00:10:55.827
Yes. I know what I advised.

232
00:10:55.862 --> 00:10:56.724
But there was a wrinkle.

233
00:10:56.758 --> 00:10:57.827
A wrinkle?

234
00:11:03.068 --> 00:11:04.034
The claim was denied.

235
00:11:04.068 --> 00:11:05.344
- What?
- What?

236
00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:06.103
Oh. lord.

237
00:11:06.137 --> 00:11:07.344
Blake.
- Wrinkle?

238
00:11:07.379 --> 00:11:07.931
Don't.

239
00:11:07.965 --> 00:11:10.379
That's an earthquake.

240
00:11:10.413 --> 00:11:13.068
Can they do that?

241
00:11:13.103 --> 00:11:15.241
Unfortunately. yes.

242
00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:19.241
It's a preventive death clause.

243
00:11:19.275 --> 00:11:22.034
Robert's clause was
contingent on him

244
00:11:22.068 --> 00:11:25.758
getting a yearly
physical. not a biannual.

245
00:11:25.793 --> 00:11:27.724
The adjuster. he checked
his medical records

246
00:11:27.758 --> 00:11:31.034
and saw that he'd seen the
doctor one day too late.

247
00:11:31.068 --> 00:11:32.827
Nah. nah. nah.

248
00:11:32.862 --> 00:11:34.758
You told me this was taken
care of at the funeral.

249
00:11:34.793 --> 00:11:36.896
You told me everything
was gonna be all right!

250
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:39.275
I was wrong.

251
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:40.793
Vicky.

252
00:11:40.827 --> 00:11:43.206
Look. the adjuster. he
went through the files.

253
00:11:43.241 --> 00:11:45.000
He started Robert had
went to the doctor.

254
00:11:45.034 --> 00:11:50.172
and his policy expired one day
before the biannual physical.

255
00:11:50.206 --> 00:11:51.965
I'm sorry.

256
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.448
I'm sorry.

257
00:11:53.482 --> 00:11:55.172
Blake. I never thought you
would come into this house

258
00:11:55.206 --> 00:11:57.448
with that kind of news.

259
00:11:57.482 --> 00:11:59.758
You think this is
easy for me. Ken?

260
00:11:59.793 --> 00:12:00.965
Look. Robert was my brother too.

261
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.862
OK. everybody.

262
00:12:01.896 --> 00:12:02.931
All right.

263
00:12:02.965 --> 00:12:05.448
We must appeal.

264
00:12:05.482 --> 00:12:07.896
Gwen can call and
request an appeal packet.

265
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:11.275
But you've got to be aware
that this process isn't fast.

266
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.068
OK. I get it.

267
00:12:16.103 --> 00:12:19.344
So that for sale sign--

268
00:12:19.379 --> 00:12:21.931
that was an idea in your
head all along. huh?

269
00:12:21.965 --> 00:12:23.862
No. no.

270
00:12:23.896 --> 00:12:26.137
It is my job to take care
of my brother's family.

271
00:12:26.172 --> 00:12:30.344
This is what you call
taking care of. Blake?

272
00:12:30.379 --> 00:12:32.448
Family?

273
00:12:32.482 --> 00:12:35.241
I'd hate to see you the
way you treat your enemies.

274
00:12:35.275 --> 00:12:38.172
This is so upsetting.

275
00:12:38.206 --> 00:12:39.827
Blake. I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

276
00:12:39.862 --> 00:12:41.793
We'll be in touch.

277
00:12:41.827 --> 00:12:42.793
Gwen.

278
00:12:42.827 --> 00:12:43.448
Blake.

279
00:12:47.931 --> 00:12:48.344
Out.

280
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.206
You have every right
to feel the way you do.

281
00:13:10.068 --> 00:13:13.206
I wanted to go there more
than anywhere else in the world.

282
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.068
I can't do that to Mom.

283
00:13:17.103 --> 00:13:19.034
My world is crashing down.

284
00:13:19.068 --> 00:13:20.965
And we might be moving.

285
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.241
It's not over. baby girl.

286
00:13:23.275 --> 00:13:26.034
And no one is moving.

287
00:13:26.068 --> 00:13:28.172
Prestige is all
that. Uncle Ken.

288
00:13:28.206 --> 00:13:29.862
Besides. you've seen the school.

289
00:13:29.896 --> 00:13:32.034
It wouldn't even put
a dent in the tuition.

290
00:13:32.068 --> 00:13:33.000
and school start soon.

291
00:13:33.034 --> 00:13:34.517
There's no time.

292
00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:36.206
OK. look.

293
00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:39.379
You've already done two years.

294
00:13:39.413 --> 00:13:42.517
Why don't we just go ahead
and finish what you started.

295
00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:43.034
Yeah. yeah.

296
00:13:43.068 --> 00:13:45.275
When's that. huh?

297
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.931
Uncle. I don't want to
be your age reminiscing

298
00:13:46.965 --> 00:13:48.379
on what could have been.

299
00:13:48.413 --> 00:13:50.137
And the only way for me
to create that network

300
00:13:50.172 --> 00:13:51.344
is at Prestige.

301
00:13:51.379 --> 00:13:53.379
You know it. and I know it.

302
00:13:53.413 --> 00:13:55.896
Well. MJ didn't
go to prestige.

303
00:13:55.931 --> 00:14:02.379
And despite what you said.
despite your words being

304
00:14:02.413 --> 00:14:04.344
hurtful. I think it's true.

305
00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:06.551
The industry is
different nowadays.

306
00:14:06.586 --> 00:14:08.137
Look at me. Unc.

307
00:14:08.172 --> 00:14:10.000
Women are changing the culture.

308
00:14:10.034 --> 00:14:12.275
And I must be where the
culture changes itself.

309
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.241
And that's Prestige.

310
00:14:13.275 --> 00:14:14.620
So it's about who you know?

311
00:14:14.655 --> 00:14:15.655
Exactly.

312
00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:17.586
This morning. I was on
the path to be a star.

313
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.965
But now. mm.

314
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.310
Vicky. your dad always
taught you that it's

315
00:14:23.344 --> 00:14:26.482
not about fame or any of that.

316
00:14:26.517 --> 00:14:28.068
It's about investing
in your future.

317
00:14:28.103 --> 00:14:30.586
It's about doing what you love.

318
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.068
Well. Unc.
one. he's not here.

319
00:14:33.103 --> 00:14:35.241
And two. he left nothing.

320
00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:36.931
I mean. you heard Mom.

321
00:14:36.965 --> 00:14:38.931
You heard Grandma.

322
00:14:38.965 --> 00:14:41.551
Look at our house. Uncle Ken.

323
00:14:41.586 --> 00:14:44.137
Trying to keep up
with the Joneses.

324
00:14:44.172 --> 00:14:47.310
Look. I understand
your being angry.

325
00:14:47.344 --> 00:14:50.655
But your dad did leave
us with something.

326
00:14:50.689 --> 00:14:52.068
Yeah.

327
00:14:52.103 --> 00:14:53.586
Nothing ever got him down.

328
00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.275
And he never let
anything get in his way.

329
00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:00.379
Vicky. please remember that.

330
00:15:00.413 --> 00:15:01.517
Well. spirit
don't pay no bills.

331
00:15:06.379 --> 00:15:13.137
And now you
only see me in my victory.

332
00:15:16.344 --> 00:15:18.344
But when you feel--

333
00:15:18.379 --> 00:15:19.241
Here you go. baby.

334
00:15:19.275 --> 00:15:20.413
I brought you some tea.

335
00:15:20.448 --> 00:15:21.724
Go on and drink that.

336
00:15:21.758 --> 00:15:22.551
Thank you.

337
00:15:22.586 --> 00:15:27.034
The lord
spoken for me.

338
00:15:27.068 --> 00:15:32.482
And I

339
00:15:32.517 --> 00:15:34.137
How are you doing. Gwen?

340
00:15:37.034 --> 00:15:38.689
Do you miss Robert?

341
00:15:38.724 --> 00:15:41.034
Well. of course I do.

342
00:15:41.068 --> 00:15:44.551
Then how come you never
seem sad about losing them?

343
00:15:44.586 --> 00:15:48.137
Well. he wouldn't
want us to be.

344
00:15:48.172 --> 00:15:51.655
Did you see the way Blake
was looking at those flowers?

345
00:15:51.689 --> 00:15:55.379
You know. he thinks
you're going crazy.

346
00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:59.034
At the moment. I don't
care what Blake thinks.

347
00:15:59.068 --> 00:16:01.551
My daughter is lost. and
so am I without Robert.

348
00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:06.241
I just can't--

349
00:16:11.172 --> 00:16:14.275
I just can't bring myself
to clean him up because--

350
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:15.379
Because of what?

351
00:16:18.517 --> 00:16:19.758
Because then he'd
be really gone.

352
00:16:22.413 --> 00:16:24.068
Well. Gwen. he is gone.

353
00:16:24.103 --> 00:16:29.172
His body's gone. but his spirit.
his spirit is still here.

354
00:16:29.206 --> 00:16:34.206
And if you clean up those
flowers. you can move forward.

355
00:16:34.241 --> 00:16:37.310
How can you just turn it off?

356
00:16:37.344 --> 00:16:40.448
It's not about
turning it off. Gwen.

357
00:16:40.482 --> 00:16:42.517
It's about turning it up.

358
00:16:42.551 --> 00:16:45.310
Turning it up to God. honey.

359
00:16:45.344 --> 00:16:49.586
Why when things go wrong do
people always say go to church?

360
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.206
Robert left us with a mess.

361
00:16:52.241 --> 00:16:54.655
I mean. look at all of
these bills and everything.

362
00:16:54.689 --> 00:16:57.068
I mean. you more than anybody
else should know that.

363
00:16:57.103 --> 00:17:02.310
Now. Gwen. Gwen. this
might look like a mess to us.

364
00:17:02.344 --> 00:17:07.793
But to him. no. it's going
in perfect order. exactly

365
00:17:07.827 --> 00:17:10.275
as planned.

366
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:11.620
How do we explain
this to Vicky?

367
00:17:14.862 --> 00:17:16.517
I know y'all
hadn't been to church

368
00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:18.482
with me since Vicky was little.

369
00:17:18.517 --> 00:17:19.827
Now. come on. listen to me.

370
00:17:19.862 --> 00:17:22.448
Maybe it's time to
dust off that Bible

371
00:17:22.482 --> 00:17:24.724
and let God reveal it to Vicky.

372
00:17:24.758 --> 00:17:26.793
Bring some balance
back in his home.

373
00:17:29.862 --> 00:17:31.551
When her first puppy
died she didn't come up

374
00:17:31.586 --> 00:17:35.172
from that basement for a week.

375
00:17:35.206 --> 00:17:39.241
Now that her plans for going
to Prestige have evaporated.

376
00:17:39.275 --> 00:17:42.172
you think she gonna come rushing
up them stairs to go to church?

377
00:17:42.206 --> 00:17:45.655
Oh. I'll get her up.

378
00:17:45.689 --> 00:17:47.517
How?

379
00:17:47.551 --> 00:17:50.448
Same way I used to
get Robert out of bed

380
00:17:50.482 --> 00:17:52.172
as a kid to go to service.

381
00:17:52.206 --> 00:17:54.517
Oh. honey. grandma got this.

382
00:17:58.482 --> 00:18:01.551
He's my
doctor in the sick room.

383
00:18:01.586 --> 00:18:05.310
he's my lawyer in the courtroom.

384
00:18:05.344 --> 00:18:13.689
He's the boss in the board room.
the last thing I'm gonna let

385
00:18:13.724 --> 00:18:16.896
you do is keep him in church.

386
00:18:16.931 --> 00:18:19.413
Grandma. is that
French toast I smell?

387
00:18:19.448 --> 00:18:20.655
Isn't this your
favorite breakfast?

388
00:18:20.689 --> 00:18:22.310
Of course it's French toast.

389
00:18:22.344 --> 00:18:25.172
Come on in here.

390
00:18:25.206 --> 00:18:26.620
Yes. thank you. Grandma.

391
00:18:26.655 --> 00:18:29.379
Oh. you're welcome. baby.

392
00:18:29.413 --> 00:18:34.724
Now. eat up and get cleaned up.
because we're going to church.

393
00:18:34.758 --> 00:18:36.620
Church?

394
00:18:36.655 --> 00:18:38.655
Grandma. I love
your French toast.

395
00:18:38.689 --> 00:18:40.241
but I'm not going to church.

396
00:18:40.275 --> 00:18:41.655
Why not?

397
00:18:41.689 --> 00:18:43.965
Because I'm not in the mood.

398
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.241
My life just got destroyed
for a second time.

399
00:18:46.275 --> 00:18:47.586
I'm upset.

400
00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.724
That's good. because
that's the perfect time

401
00:18:49.758 --> 00:18:51.517
to lean on God.

402
00:18:51.551 --> 00:18:54.862
Now. go on and eat up.

403
00:18:54.896 --> 00:18:59.758
I'll eat. but I'm
not going to church.

404
00:18:59.793 --> 00:19:02.551
Girl. I just spent a whole
hour pulling that breakfast

405
00:19:02.586 --> 00:19:04.344
together for you.

406
00:19:04.379 --> 00:19:06.931
I know you got an hour to
accompany me to church.

407
00:19:06.965 --> 00:19:08.931
or else I'm gonna us
this spoon to crack it

408
00:19:08.965 --> 00:19:11.793
over that little
lazy behind of yours.

409
00:19:11.827 --> 00:19:13.793
Yes. ma'am.

410
00:19:13.827 --> 00:19:17.793
But you'll never
get mom to come.

411
00:19:17.827 --> 00:19:19.310
Oh. really?

412
00:19:19.344 --> 00:19:22.862
It was your mama's idea.

413
00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:24.827
You better get your
Sunday best on real

414
00:19:24.862 --> 00:19:28.413
quick. because we're going to
church today and praise him.

415
00:19:35.344 --> 00:19:42.586
You so
amazing. my God.

416
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:50.310
You are so amazing. my God.

417
00:19:50.344 --> 00:19:53.931
You are so amazing.

418
00:19:53.965 --> 00:19:56.448
In order
for us to genuinely

419
00:19:56.482 --> 00:20:01.827
be blessed by God. like Jacob.
we've got to wrestle with God.

420
00:20:04.275 --> 00:20:07.000
Interesting. Jacob
wrestles with the Lord

421
00:20:07.034 --> 00:20:11.724
and he wrestles all night and
the day is about to break.

422
00:20:11.758 --> 00:20:13.517
OK.

423
00:20:13.551 --> 00:20:20.586
And as the day approaches. the
angel says to Jacob. let me go.

424
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.793
And Jacob says. I
want you to bless me.

425
00:20:23.827 --> 00:20:26.827
so I'm not going to let go.

426
00:20:26.862 --> 00:20:30.448
Come on here.
until you bless me.

427
00:20:32.896 --> 00:20:38.034
Now. the angel now does
something and flips the script.

428
00:20:38.068 --> 00:20:45.000
He says to Jacob. all right.
since you want a blessing.

429
00:20:45.034 --> 00:20:47.551
let me ask you a question.

430
00:20:47.586 --> 00:20:50.965
What is your name?

431
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.586
Now. you've got to
understand something.

432
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:59.689
the last time somebody
asked Jacob his name.

433
00:20:59.724 --> 00:21:07.655
he lied and he said
he was somebody else.

434
00:21:07.689 --> 00:21:11.034
And so all the things that have
happened to him from the point

435
00:21:11.068 --> 00:21:14.655
that he lied about
his name to this point

436
00:21:14.689 --> 00:21:19.896
has happened under
false pretenses.

437
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:24.896
He's been living under
somebody else's identity.

438
00:21:24.931 --> 00:21:27.000
But in order to get
the breakthrough

439
00:21:27.034 --> 00:21:31.379
that you really need. you got
to own who you really are.

440
00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:39.000
And so the angel said I can
bless you. I will bless you.

441
00:21:39.034 --> 00:21:43.413
But before I do. you
got to say your name.

442
00:21:43.448 --> 00:21:47.896
If we're going to get from
God what God wants us to have.

443
00:21:47.931 --> 00:21:52.689
we've got to own
who we really are.

444
00:21:52.724 --> 00:21:55.034
And so the angel says.
what is your name?

445
00:21:55.068 --> 00:21:59.068
And he says wow. he has
to go back to first base

446
00:21:59.103 --> 00:22:03.896
and he has to admit my
name is Jacob. which

447
00:22:03.931 --> 00:22:09.413
means trickster. schemer. liar.

448
00:22:09.448 --> 00:22:13.896
But what I like about God
is that once I acknowledge

449
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:17.068
who I am. he changes my name.

450
00:22:18.206 --> 00:22:21.896
I just wonder has God ever
changed anybody's name?

451
00:22:21.931 --> 00:22:26.103
I know you were a liar.
but now you are true.

452
00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:30.034
I know you were darkness.
but now you are light.

453
00:22:30.068 --> 00:22:32.793
You are not what
they say you are.

454
00:22:32.827 --> 00:22:35.896
Baby. you ain't even
what you say you are.

455
00:22:35.931 --> 00:22:38.965
You are what God says you are.

456
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.482
I wish the church
would say Amen.

457
00:22:41.517 --> 00:22:42.551
Amen.

458
00:22:42.586 --> 00:22:43.000
Amen!

459
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.793
Put your hands together now
and let's receive our youth

460
00:22:48.827 --> 00:22:52.034
pastor. Brother .

461
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.551
What a word from our pastor.

462
00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:01.137
Because
you give me joy.

463
00:23:01.172 --> 00:23:06.896
down deep in my soul.
down deep in my soul.

464
00:23:06.931 --> 00:23:09.655
down deep in my soul.

465
00:23:09.689 --> 00:23:15.965
Yes. you give me joy down
deep in my soul. down deep

466
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.482
in my soul. down
deep in my soul.

467
00:23:20.517 --> 00:23:26.103
My God. Nehemiah 8 and 6 "And
Ezra blessed the Lord. thy God.

468
00:23:26.137 --> 00:23:29.620
And the people of
God answered. Amen."

469
00:23:29.655 --> 00:23:36.000
Come on. make this your
response to whatever it is.

470
00:23:36.034 --> 00:23:41.724
From the healing of your body.
to the raising of the dead.

471
00:23:41.758 --> 00:23:46.965
No matter how you're feeling.
or how your world is reeling.

472
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.965
battle through the night.
because you're going to win.

473
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.517
you're going to win this fight.

474
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:58.620
Amen. Amen. Amen.

475
00:24:18.724 --> 00:24:19.896
Admissions?

476
00:24:19.931 --> 00:24:21.724
I'm here to see Junior.

477
00:24:21.758 --> 00:24:23.862
In all my years working
here. you're the first one's

478
00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:25.034
ever came this early.

479
00:24:25.068 --> 00:24:26.758
Look. I know
probably about00

480
00:24:26.793 --> 00:24:28.758
it's going to be hundreds
of students waiting out here

481
00:24:28.793 --> 00:24:29.965
for scheduling questions.

482
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.758
I just need to see
him for a minute.

483
00:24:31.793 --> 00:24:32.620
You're a student?

484
00:24:32.655 --> 00:24:34.896
I'm trying to be.

485
00:24:34.931 --> 00:24:36.034
Side door. building A.

486
00:24:36.068 --> 00:24:37.068
Thank you.

487
00:24:37.103 --> 00:24:38.586
If you get caught. wasn't me.

488
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.586
Thank you so much. thank you.

489
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.689
Hey. good luck.

490
00:24:43.724 --> 00:24:44.137
Yes. sir.

491
00:25:18.793 --> 00:25:19.931
You guys are flat.

492
00:25:19.965 --> 00:25:21.689
Hold it tight right there.

493
00:25:21.724 --> 00:25:25.655
Every head has to be tilted
at 100 degree angle in order

494
00:25:25.689 --> 00:25:26.965
to maximize key.

495
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.827
I believe you're at 95.

496
00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:32.275
Try it again.

497
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:34.068
Oh. love.

498
00:25:34.103 --> 00:25:35.793
That's better. much better.

499
00:25:39.275 --> 00:25:41.965
Your body has to
know this position.

500
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.620
It has to come natural.

501
00:25:43.655 --> 00:25:48.689
Touch your throat. and you
can feel it when you sing.

502
00:25:48.724 --> 00:25:50.586
I'm
not doing that.

503
00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.758
That was disgusting.

504
00:25:52.793 --> 00:25:55.931
Remember our creed.

505
00:25:55.965 --> 00:26:06.379
True musicians do
everything to support music.

506
00:26:06.413 --> 00:26:07.896
is that understood?

507
00:26:07.931 --> 00:26:09.000
I'm sorry.

508
00:26:13.172 --> 00:26:20.000
Now. touch your
throats and try it again.

509
00:26:20.034 --> 00:26:21.172
Ahhhh.

510
00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:50.965
Yo. freshman. what
are you doing in here?

511
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.413
Junior. you scared me.

512
00:26:52.448 --> 00:26:53.827
Well. you can't be
in here. all right.

513
00:26:53.862 --> 00:26:57.034
Neither can I. Come on.

514
00:26:57.068 --> 00:26:59.137
Listen. I need your help.

515
00:27:02.862 --> 00:27:05.793
With what?

516
00:27:05.827 --> 00:27:08.896
I need a scholarship.

517
00:27:08.931 --> 00:27:10.448
And I need a
million bucks. OK.

518
00:27:10.482 --> 00:27:12.206
I just process the
paperwork. Vicky.

519
00:27:12.241 --> 00:27:13.793
I don't actually
do scholarships.

520
00:27:13.827 --> 00:27:16.379
Those are the trustees
and Chancellor Davis.

521
00:27:16.413 --> 00:27:18.137
Four per year. they've
already been given

522
00:27:18.172 --> 00:27:21.896
out. except for Music Fest.

523
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:22.965
The Music Fest?

524
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.103
Yeah.

525
00:27:24.137 --> 00:27:24.931
It's my only
shot at getting in.

526
00:27:24.965 --> 00:27:26.068
What happened?

527
00:27:26.103 --> 00:27:27.862
I thought you were all in.

528
00:27:27.896 --> 00:27:29.379
Not anymore.

529
00:27:29.413 --> 00:27:32.000
Listen. you said it. the
path to my music career

530
00:27:32.034 --> 00:27:33.379
leads right through Prestige.

531
00:27:33.413 --> 00:27:39.034
But Music Fest is
only for fraternities.

532
00:27:39.068 --> 00:27:40.275
Well. you have to--

533
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:43.206
I know. Mr. Moore's
frats always win.

534
00:27:43.241 --> 00:27:44.448
But listen. I can beat them.

535
00:27:44.482 --> 00:27:46.793
I'm like Missy
Elliott. only better.

536
00:27:46.827 --> 00:27:49.758
All right. listen. Vicky.
you can't compete solo.

537
00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:51.379
All right. you have
to be in a fraternity.

538
00:27:51.413 --> 00:27:53.758
and you're a girl. so
it's not going to work.

539
00:27:53.793 --> 00:27:54.448
I'll start one.

540
00:27:54.482 --> 00:27:56.137
It can't be that hard.

541
00:27:56.172 --> 00:27:57.344
You're not even a
Prestige student yet.

542
00:27:57.379 --> 00:27:59.034
You wouldn't know
how to do that.

543
00:27:59.068 --> 00:28:01.275
Now come on. I've
got to get some work.

544
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:05.482
Wait. what if
I'm in transition?

545
00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:09.275
It will never work. and you'll
be trying to scam the system.

546
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:11.241
Junior. that's why
I need your help.

547
00:28:11.275 --> 00:28:13.034
I'm not going to
be part of this.

548
00:28:13.068 --> 00:28:13.965
Now. let's go.

549
00:28:19.344 --> 00:28:22.103
V. we already talked about this.

550
00:28:22.137 --> 00:28:23.310
That's why I need your help.

551
00:28:23.344 --> 00:28:25.103
Can you meet me
tonight after work?

552
00:28:25.137 --> 00:28:26.793
I have nothing to
lose but to just try.

553
00:28:26.827 --> 00:28:28.517
But I do.

554
00:28:28.551 --> 00:28:31.793
Look. man. when my pops
passed all of my options

555
00:28:31.827 --> 00:28:34.034
died with him. and I need this.

556
00:28:34.068 --> 00:28:35.965
You're not in my shoes.

557
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.137
You're not.

558
00:28:37.172 --> 00:28:38.896
I worked my butt
off to get here.

559
00:28:38.931 --> 00:28:41.103
and I won't put myself on
Chancellor Davis' hit list.

560
00:28:41.137 --> 00:28:43.103
Look. you have no idea
what you're up against.

561
00:28:43.137 --> 00:28:44.827
You can't beat the system.

562
00:28:44.862 --> 00:28:47.827
No frat. no entry. and I
can't take that chance.

563
00:28:47.862 --> 00:28:50.793
Yeah. I guess it's always
the system when you're

564
00:28:50.827 --> 00:28:51.448
on the outside looking in.

565
00:28:54.068 --> 00:28:57.000
But I need this. Junior.

566
00:28:57.034 --> 00:29:00.206
I'm sorry. V. I got to go.

567
00:29:23.413 --> 00:29:25.586
Admissions. this is Junior.

568
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.448
Thanks.

569
00:29:32.241 --> 00:29:35.068
Have the final
applications gone out?

570
00:29:35.103 --> 00:29:37.000
Yes. sir. this morning.

571
00:29:37.034 --> 00:29:38.482
Good.

572
00:29:38.517 --> 00:29:40.206
Good.

573
00:29:40.241 --> 00:29:43.275
Somewhere in that group
is the next big star.

574
00:29:47.413 --> 00:29:50.000
What if the next big
star is in this school?

575
00:29:54.068 --> 00:29:55.551
I beg your pardon?

576
00:29:55.586 --> 00:30:00.379
Like a person with natural
talent. but no tuition money.

577
00:30:00.413 --> 00:30:02.413
I don't need your
additional help.

578
00:30:02.448 --> 00:30:05.034
and we don't need any
more broke students here.

579
00:30:05.068 --> 00:30:06.137
That's not how I built this.

580
00:30:06.172 --> 00:30:07.517
No. no. no. what I--

581
00:30:07.551 --> 00:30:11.034
Na. na. na. the only
reason you are here

582
00:30:11.068 --> 00:30:14.620
is because you accepted the
job to pay off your debt.

583
00:30:14.655 --> 00:30:16.551
I just meant what if we
missed out on the chance

584
00:30:16.586 --> 00:30:17.896
to bring in a true star.

585
00:30:17.931 --> 00:30:20.344
We-- we-- we?

586
00:30:20.379 --> 00:30:26.103
This school is a system. it
has and will continue to be.

587
00:30:26.137 --> 00:30:29.034
Now. the alum. they
pay me good money

588
00:30:29.068 --> 00:30:33.034
to keep the system in place.

589
00:30:33.068 --> 00:30:41.172
Anything that goes against
the grain. I squash them.

590
00:30:53.068 --> 00:30:54.413
Nobody but Jesus.

591
00:30:54.448 --> 00:30:57.034
If your feet start slipping--

592
00:30:58.448 --> 00:30:59.482
Who is it this time of night?

593
00:31:02.344 --> 00:31:03.137
Hey.

594
00:31:03.172 --> 00:31:05.551
Hey. is Vicky here?

595
00:31:05.586 --> 00:31:07.965
Then you have to arrange
a meeting with GLO

596
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.413
to declare your intent
to start that chapter.

597
00:31:11.448 --> 00:31:14.103
Wait. hold on.
fraternities are for men

598
00:31:14.137 --> 00:31:15.931
and sororities are for women.

599
00:31:15.965 --> 00:31:17.103
Yeah.

600
00:31:17.137 --> 00:31:19.655
My plan. you're in
transition. right?

601
00:31:19.689 --> 00:31:22.310
Let's go along with that.

602
00:31:22.344 --> 00:31:23.655
Go along with what?

603
00:31:23.689 --> 00:31:25.034
I'm in transition.

604
00:31:25.068 --> 00:31:26.241
Yeah.

605
00:31:26.275 --> 00:31:28.103
My mama will kill me. Junior.

606
00:31:28.137 --> 00:31:30.413
Isn't there a process for
people that are in transition?

607
00:31:30.448 --> 00:31:32.068
No. thought about this. too.

608
00:31:32.103 --> 00:31:33.275
You're going to
go to your closet

609
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:37.413
and dress down. like
all the way down.

610
00:31:37.448 --> 00:31:39.137
And through this
process. you'll start

611
00:31:39.172 --> 00:31:43.965
to feel and act more like a
tomboy. just until Music Fest.

612
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.620
OK?

613
00:31:46.655 --> 00:31:48.482
GLO is Greek Life
Obviously. right?

614
00:31:48.517 --> 00:31:49.137
Correct.

615
00:31:49.172 --> 00:31:50.965
And there's one on campus.

616
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.379
Then you'll have to
draft up a Constitution

617
00:31:52.413 --> 00:31:54.241
and bylaws for your sor--

618
00:31:54.275 --> 00:31:55.586
fraternity. in this case.

619
00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:01.000
And well. just get
a vote to pass them.

620
00:32:01.034 --> 00:32:02.310
Can't we just move forward?

621
00:32:02.344 --> 00:32:04.034
I just want to perform and sing.

622
00:32:04.068 --> 00:32:06.482
If it was that easy then
everybody would be doing it.

623
00:32:06.517 --> 00:32:12.310
OK. look. I came here
with a plan. sort of.

624
00:32:12.344 --> 00:32:16.137
OK. all right.
I'm in transition.

625
00:32:16.172 --> 00:32:17.482
Great.

626
00:32:17.517 --> 00:32:18.448
Wait. hold on. let me
hear you sing something

627
00:32:18.482 --> 00:32:21.620
before we go any further.

628
00:32:21.655 --> 00:32:24.034
Hmm. OK.

629
00:32:24.068 --> 00:32:28.551
People dying.
people killing. people riding.

630
00:32:28.586 --> 00:32:30.551
people stealing.

631
00:32:30.586 --> 00:32:35.137
And I don't know what it is.
something's got to change.

632
00:32:35.172 --> 00:32:37.310
OK. OK.

633
00:32:37.344 --> 00:32:40.034
That just might work.

634
00:32:40.068 --> 00:32:45.034
Well. all right. if it's that
easy then. you know. I can.

635
00:32:45.068 --> 00:32:47.068
And if I'm the only one
in it I can win Music

636
00:32:47.103 --> 00:32:48.137
- Fest.
- Mm-hmm.

637
00:32:48.172 --> 00:32:49.000
Get a scholarship.

638
00:32:49.034 --> 00:32:49.551
Mm-hmm.

639
00:32:49.586 --> 00:32:53.551
Then become famous.

640
00:32:53.586 --> 00:32:56.655
It sounds like you've got
it all mapped out. freshman.

641
00:32:56.689 --> 00:32:57.965
You don't need my help.

642
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.206
Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.
come on. where are you going?

643
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:03.655
Chancellor Davis was right.

644
00:33:03.689 --> 00:33:06.344
People just trying
to turn the system.

645
00:33:06.379 --> 00:33:07.172
Don't do that.

646
00:33:07.206 --> 00:33:09.827
Come on. Junior.

647
00:33:09.862 --> 00:33:12.620
OK. first of all. I came
here not to make you famous.

648
00:33:12.655 --> 00:33:14.689
but to help you win
that scholarship.

649
00:33:14.724 --> 00:33:15.517
OK?

650
00:33:15.551 --> 00:33:16.793
OK.

651
00:33:16.827 --> 00:33:18.448
And I forgot the Music
Fest is male driven.

652
00:33:18.482 --> 00:33:23.724
but I mean. things in
motion just stay in motion.

653
00:33:23.758 --> 00:33:25.620
Who said women
can't win anyway?

654
00:33:25.655 --> 00:33:29.206
Who made those stupid rules up?

655
00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:30.310
Chancellor Davis.

656
00:33:31.827 --> 00:33:32.620
I've never been
on the front line of war.

657
00:33:32.655 --> 00:33:34.655
Look. I've got
to do this. Junior.

658
00:33:34.689 --> 00:33:38.068
So many women are counting
on the rules to be changed.

659
00:33:38.103 --> 00:33:40.551
So transitioning it is.

660
00:33:40.586 --> 00:33:43.068
I won't say a word to anyone.

661
00:33:43.103 --> 00:33:44.586
I never hung a
missile. high in the sky.

662
00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.517
I need to figure out what
I'm gonna write for my speech.

663
00:33:47.551 --> 00:33:48.689
What?

664
00:33:48.724 --> 00:33:50.206
I'm just playing.

665
00:33:50.241 --> 00:33:51.551
Better be.

666
00:33:51.586 --> 00:33:55.551
Running
for their lives.

667
00:33:55.586 --> 00:33:59.034
Why-- why did
you do this for me?

668
00:33:59.068 --> 00:34:00.655
What?

669
00:34:00.689 --> 00:34:02.517
I mean. I never would have
found any of this information

670
00:34:02.551 --> 00:34:03.551
and all.

671
00:34:03.586 --> 00:34:04.620
Like. why are you helping me?

672
00:34:04.655 --> 00:34:05.758
Davis.

673
00:34:05.793 --> 00:34:07.655
I mean. he's just
such a-- you know.

674
00:34:07.689 --> 00:34:10.793
I just want to see him squirm.

675
00:34:10.827 --> 00:34:11.689
What?

676
00:34:11.724 --> 00:34:13.241
You're helping me
because of Davis?

677
00:34:13.275 --> 00:34:14.655
Mm-hmm.

678
00:34:14.689 --> 00:34:16.793
See. you're no dear friend.

679
00:34:16.827 --> 00:34:20.379
These bylaws and rules.
they are for men.

680
00:34:20.413 --> 00:34:21.275
No. it's not.

681
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:22.206
Not women.

682
00:34:22.241 --> 00:34:23.793
It's more than that. OK.

683
00:34:23.827 --> 00:34:26.275
Chancellor Davis will never
allow anyone to do anything

684
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.793
unless it's under his terms.

685
00:34:27.827 --> 00:34:30.275
There's no wiggle room.

686
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:33.379
Besides. I saw your file.

687
00:34:33.413 --> 00:34:34.689
You don't have a
lot of time. and I

688
00:34:34.724 --> 00:34:36.310
want to see you stick
it to Chancellor

689
00:34:36.344 --> 00:34:38.275
Davis and his system. shoot.

690
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.103
Yeah?

691
00:34:39.137 --> 00:34:40.689
Yeah.

692
00:34:40.724 --> 00:34:42.413
Honestly. I thought you
were part of his system too.

693
00:34:42.448 --> 00:34:44.137
but I guess I was wrong.

694
00:34:44.172 --> 00:34:44.827
Yeah.

695
00:34:48.689 --> 00:34:50.137
- You like me. don't you?
- What?

696
00:34:50.172 --> 00:34:51.275
No. I like working in the--
- Yeah. right.

697
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:52.793
No. I work--

698
00:34:52.827 --> 00:34:53.896
OK. look. I work in
the admissions office

699
00:34:53.931 --> 00:34:56.103
in order to make. you
know. tuition and continue

700
00:34:56.137 --> 00:34:57.482
going to this school.

701
00:34:57.517 --> 00:34:59.379
Look. it's like you said.
OK. Prestige is a world

702
00:34:59.413 --> 00:35:02.379
renowned school. you know.

703
00:35:02.413 --> 00:35:05.862
I do wish I could stick it to
him the way you do. though.

704
00:35:05.896 --> 00:35:07.068
But look. there's not
a lot of time. OK.

705
00:35:07.103 --> 00:35:09.862
and you're going to need all
the help in short fashion

706
00:35:09.896 --> 00:35:11.068
that you can get.

707
00:35:11.103 --> 00:35:16.586
Now. go forth and start your
one man woman fraternity.

708
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:17.827
Get yourself into
Prestige. girl.

709
00:35:21.896 --> 00:35:23.827
A one man fraternity.

710
00:35:23.862 --> 00:35:24.931
Hey. hey.

711
00:35:24.965 --> 00:35:28.275
There is no such thing.

712
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:30.724
This is my Uncle Ken.

713
00:35:30.758 --> 00:35:31.620
Hello. sir.

714
00:35:31.655 --> 00:35:33.172
It's good to meet you.

715
00:35:33.206 --> 00:35:35.344
All right.

716
00:35:35.379 --> 00:35:37.620
How much did you hear?

717
00:35:37.655 --> 00:35:42.551
Every last word.
especially that one

718
00:35:42.586 --> 00:35:44.482
man fraternity business.

719
00:35:44.517 --> 00:35:46.379
Oh. here we go.

720
00:35:46.413 --> 00:35:48.689
Not another story.

721
00:35:48.724 --> 00:35:51.586
Now. according to
your documents there.

722
00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.965
a fraternity is
defined by a group

723
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.965
of individuals coming together
to share a common interest.

724
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.586
Well. a fraternity is
way more than that.

725
00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:03.758
A fraternity is a--
it's a brotherhood.

726
00:36:03.793 --> 00:36:07.241
It's a network of boys coming
together to become men.

727
00:36:07.275 --> 00:36:08.655
He's right.

728
00:36:08.689 --> 00:36:09.965
You need at least two people
to start a fraternity.

729
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.758
It says it right
here. and one of them

730
00:36:12.793 --> 00:36:14.793
have to be a current student.

731
00:36:14.827 --> 00:36:17.241
So can you and
I do it together?

732
00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:19.413
Vicky. you are not listening.

733
00:36:19.448 --> 00:36:20.586
Brotherhood.

734
00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.931
Women join sororities.

735
00:36:22.965 --> 00:36:24.896
Frats are for the bros.

736
00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:26.310
He's right.

737
00:36:26.344 --> 00:36:27.931
I can't join a fraternity.

738
00:36:27.965 --> 00:36:30.620
But Junior is the only
current student I know.

739
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:39.000
So OK. so you mean I have
to find a guy on campus

740
00:36:39.034 --> 00:36:42.655
with no friends of his
own and willing to start

741
00:36:42.689 --> 00:36:45.517
a frat with a total stranger?

742
00:36:45.551 --> 00:36:48.965
I mean. is there really anybody
at Prestige that pathetic?

743
00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.413
I might just have
somebody pathetic in mind.

744
00:36:58.448 --> 00:37:01.344
OK. so you're
actually going to go

745
00:37:01.379 --> 00:37:04.551
through with this wacked idea?

746
00:37:04.586 --> 00:37:06.034
Yeah. Unc.

747
00:37:06.068 --> 00:37:08.551
I mean. come on. you
cannot tell my mother about

748
00:37:08.586 --> 00:37:11.586
this unless you got
some money buried

749
00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:12.931
in the backyard somewhere.

750
00:37:12.965 --> 00:37:14.965
I don't know nothing.
I didn't hear nothing.

751
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.586
And when the ship
comes crashing in.

752
00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.034
you keep my name
out of your mouth.

753
00:37:20.068 --> 00:37:22.000
Hey. I got you. OK.

754
00:37:22.034 --> 00:37:23.724
You won't have to
worry about me. Unc.

755
00:37:26.586 --> 00:37:27.827
Crossing guard?

756
00:37:27.862 --> 00:37:30.413
He's a student
and a great singer.

757
00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:33.034
He's a student liaison. which
basically makes him Chancellor

758
00:37:33.068 --> 00:37:35.448
Davis' personal caddy.

759
00:37:35.482 --> 00:37:37.379
Then why is he
wearing a reflective vest?

760
00:37:37.413 --> 00:37:38.344
Well--

761
00:37:38.379 --> 00:37:38.965
And stopping cars.

762
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.068
Yeah.

763
00:37:40.103 --> 00:37:41.862
Because of his association
with Chancellor Davis.

764
00:37:41.896 --> 00:37:44.034
everybody calls him
Mitch the Snitch.

765
00:37:44.068 --> 00:37:45.758
Mitch the Snitch!
Mitch the Snitch!

766
00:37:45.793 --> 00:37:47.344
So he volunteers
for all this extra stuff

767
00:37:47.379 --> 00:37:48.689
to make friends.

768
00:37:48.724 --> 00:37:49.551
It's not working.

769
00:37:49.586 --> 00:37:50.517
It's crazy.

770
00:37:50.551 --> 00:37:51.827
Yeah.

771
00:37:51.862 --> 00:37:53.344
I posted messages
all over social media

772
00:37:53.379 --> 00:37:54.689
for Prestige students.
you know. letting them

773
00:37:54.724 --> 00:37:56.344
know I'm starting a new frat.

774
00:37:56.379 --> 00:37:57.413
Got no takers.

775
00:37:57.448 --> 00:37:58.344
Think he'll go for this?

776
00:37:58.379 --> 00:37:59.551
Without a doubt.

777
00:37:59.586 --> 00:38:00.551
He'd climb into a
tree if he thought

778
00:38:00.586 --> 00:38:01.724
the girls would like him.

779
00:38:01.758 --> 00:38:02.551
Whatever it takes.

780
00:38:06.965 --> 00:38:08.758
All right.
so just stick to the plan.

781
00:38:11.758 --> 00:38:15.586
So. Mitch. did you
get the message?

782
00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.448
What do you think?

783
00:38:17.482 --> 00:38:19.068
Yeah. sure. I'm in.

784
00:38:19.103 --> 00:38:20.379
Yeah?

785
00:38:20.413 --> 00:38:21.034
Yeah.

786
00:38:21.068 --> 00:38:22.827
Do I sign these or?

787
00:38:22.862 --> 00:38:23.931
Just the registration form.

788
00:38:23.965 --> 00:38:25.482
We'll turn it in
at the GLO office.

789
00:38:25.517 --> 00:38:27.034
Cool beans.

790
00:38:27.068 --> 00:38:28.896
I'm finally going
to be in a frat.

791
00:38:28.931 --> 00:38:30.620
When do we get matching tattoos?

792
00:38:30.655 --> 00:38:33.724
All right. do you have
any real questions. Mitch?

793
00:38:33.758 --> 00:38:35.103
I don't think so.

794
00:38:35.137 --> 00:38:37.068
This is going to look
good on my resume

795
00:38:37.103 --> 00:38:38.965
once it's time for Chancellor
Davis to pin somebody.

796
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.965
Oh my gosh. dude.
will you drop that?

797
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.620
That whole pin thing
is an urban legend. OK.

798
00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:46.413
Uh-uh. it's real.

799
00:38:46.448 --> 00:38:49.034
What pin?

800
00:38:49.068 --> 00:38:51.000
OK. rumor has it that
Chancellor Davis has

801
00:38:51.034 --> 00:38:52.793
this solid gold pin
that he uses to name

802
00:38:52.827 --> 00:38:54.413
the next student headmaster.

803
00:38:54.448 --> 00:38:56.000
This is like being named
student council president.

804
00:38:56.034 --> 00:38:58.448
It gives you authority over
the entire student body.

805
00:38:58.482 --> 00:39:01.620
It's real. and someday
it's going to be mine.

806
00:39:01.655 --> 00:39:03.896
Oh. I'd do anything
to get that pin.

807
00:39:03.931 --> 00:39:07.034
Sure. the only thing
is nobody's ever seen it.

808
00:39:07.068 --> 00:39:08.862
The last time he allegedly
named a student headmaster

809
00:39:08.896 --> 00:39:10.172
was. like. eight years ago.

810
00:39:10.206 --> 00:39:11.655
But the geeks believe
in it like it's the Loch

811
00:39:11.689 --> 00:39:13.034
Ness Monster or something.

812
00:39:13.068 --> 00:39:17.068
FYI the Loch Ness
Monster is real.

813
00:39:17.103 --> 00:39:18.206
Point proven.

814
00:39:18.241 --> 00:39:20.448
Look. Mitch. is there
anything else that you need

815
00:39:20.482 --> 00:39:22.655
to know about Old Vick here?

816
00:39:22.689 --> 00:39:24.482
I know the basics.

817
00:39:24.517 --> 00:39:28.137
Graduated of Glen Valley.
honor roll. lives on prospects.

818
00:39:28.172 --> 00:39:32.793
single family home. plays
piano and string instruments.

819
00:39:32.827 --> 00:39:34.551
but specializes in singing.

820
00:39:34.586 --> 00:39:37.620
Lost her dad. being raised
by your mother. uncle.

821
00:39:37.655 --> 00:39:39.068
and grandmother.

822
00:39:39.103 --> 00:39:41.758
The system has
Vicky as Victoria.

823
00:39:41.793 --> 00:39:44.000
I'm in transition.

824
00:39:44.034 --> 00:39:46.000
I know you're in transition.

825
00:39:48.896 --> 00:39:51.000
Wait. was it something I said?

826
00:39:51.034 --> 00:39:53.896
Bro. I'm trying to
figure out how are you--

827
00:39:53.931 --> 00:39:55.206
how did you know all that?

828
00:39:55.241 --> 00:39:58.068
Yeah. Mitch. how did
you know all of that?

829
00:39:58.103 --> 00:39:59.896
I read everything.

830
00:39:59.931 --> 00:40:03.137
And when Junior said
I'd be meeting you.

831
00:40:03.172 --> 00:40:06.206
I looked at your file
when I was making copies.

832
00:40:06.241 --> 00:40:09.482
He asked for your app and
transcript a few days ago.

833
00:40:09.517 --> 00:40:12.068
Oh gosh.

834
00:40:12.103 --> 00:40:13.172
Really?

835
00:40:13.206 --> 00:40:15.103
Did you just say what I
just think you just said?

836
00:40:15.137 --> 00:40:17.758
So the chancellor
is interested in me?

837
00:40:17.793 --> 00:40:19.068
Oh. I'm so in.

838
00:40:19.103 --> 00:40:20.551
Stop smiling.

839
00:40:20.586 --> 00:40:21.655
That's not a good thing.

840
00:40:21.689 --> 00:40:22.896
If he's seen your file. and he--

841
00:40:22.931 --> 00:40:24.655
Knows you're in
transition. he will

842
00:40:24.689 --> 00:40:26.068
deaden this before we start.

843
00:40:26.103 --> 00:40:26.931
Exactly.

844
00:40:26.965 --> 00:40:28.655
Being on Chancellor
Davis's radar

845
00:40:28.689 --> 00:40:30.172
is like having a
drone above your head.

846
00:40:30.206 --> 00:40:32.620
At any moment. a boom. a precise
missile strike can happen.

847
00:40:32.655 --> 00:40:35.896
Listen. Mitch. you need to make
those files disappear. man.

848
00:40:35.931 --> 00:40:38.172
Wait. what did I do
to get on his hit list?

849
00:40:38.206 --> 00:40:40.034
That's the thing.
nobody ever knows.

850
00:40:40.068 --> 00:40:42.103
But if Chancellor Davis feels
like you're not Prestige

851
00:40:42.137 --> 00:40:44.000
material then he starts
to coordinate his MO

852
00:40:44.034 --> 00:40:46.103
and for a full annihilation.

853
00:40:46.137 --> 00:40:48.793
It's not uncommon for
him to check for the files

854
00:40:48.827 --> 00:40:50.689
of incoming freshmen.

855
00:40:50.724 --> 00:40:53.137
He likes to keep his fingers on
the pulse of the student body.

856
00:40:53.172 --> 00:40:55.689
considers it shaping
the Prestige mold.

857
00:40:55.724 --> 00:40:57.103
Yeah. the same
way the Terminator

858
00:40:57.137 --> 00:40:58.793
has full knowledge of
the human body in order

859
00:40:58.827 --> 00:41:02.620
to make him a more
effective killing machine.

860
00:41:02.655 --> 00:41:04.896
Did you know that Junior's
major is musical theater?

861
00:41:04.931 --> 00:41:05.896
All right. man.

862
00:41:05.931 --> 00:41:06.896
He's an actual drama queen.

863
00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:08.034
OK. dude. calm down.

864
00:41:08.068 --> 00:41:09.551
Tried and
true in the flesh.

865
00:41:09.586 --> 00:41:10.896
Don't listen to him.
all right. he's crazy.

866
00:41:10.931 --> 00:41:12.862
Don't let him scare you.

867
00:41:12.896 --> 00:41:15.517
Listen. I don't
know who to believe.

868
00:41:15.551 --> 00:41:16.413
but I have nothing to lose.

869
00:41:16.448 --> 00:41:19.793
So Mitch. if you're
in. let's do it.

870
00:41:19.827 --> 00:41:22.586
Let's do it. brother.

871
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.034
You might want to get
these nails cleaned up.

872
00:41:25.068 --> 00:41:27.689
Mitch. just have that
file back to us. OK?

873
00:41:27.724 --> 00:41:29.517
I'm so worth it.

874
00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:45.793
I have been waiting for you.

875
00:41:53.586 --> 00:41:54.793
Name?

876
00:41:54.827 --> 00:41:56.620
Dang. you tall.

877
00:41:56.655 --> 00:41:58.655
Are you trying to be on a
basketball team or something.

878
00:41:58.689 --> 00:42:00.689
be my center?

879
00:42:00.724 --> 00:42:02.862
Name?

880
00:42:02.896 --> 00:42:04.793
Don't have one.

881
00:42:04.827 --> 00:42:06.137
Alpha Chiro.

882
00:42:06.172 --> 00:42:08.275
Yeah. they don't
exist on campus. right?

883
00:42:19.241 --> 00:42:20.586
That's correct.

884
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:46.241
Good. good. good. good.
Kevin. stand taller.

885
00:42:46.275 --> 00:42:49.689
Joe. project without
screaming. all right.

886
00:42:49.724 --> 00:42:53.620
From the diaphragm.
here. let's try it again.

887
00:42:53.655 --> 00:42:59.862
I'll make love to
you. like you want me to.

888
00:42:59.896 --> 00:43:01.862
Excellent. excellent.

889
00:43:01.896 --> 00:43:03.379
You guys sound great.

890
00:43:03.413 --> 00:43:05.034
Listen. I hope you're
ready. because you're

891
00:43:05.068 --> 00:43:06.862
going to be closing
out the Music Fest

892
00:43:06.896 --> 00:43:10.000
this season with a big finale.

893
00:43:10.034 --> 00:43:12.310
Be sure not to disappoint.

894
00:43:17.724 --> 00:43:19.758
OK. let's try it again.

895
00:43:19.793 --> 00:43:27.068
I'll make love to
you. like you want me to.

896
00:43:27.103 --> 00:43:28.206
These guys are ready.

897
00:43:28.241 --> 00:43:29.965
Let me talk to
you for a second.

898
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.862
Yeah. Brian?

899
00:43:31.896 --> 00:43:34.724
I want my students to
perform without interruptions.

900
00:43:34.758 --> 00:43:39.000
which means I need you to
give them time to perform.

901
00:43:39.034 --> 00:43:40.379
Is that understood?

902
00:43:40.413 --> 00:43:42.206
Yeah. understood.

903
00:43:42.241 --> 00:43:46.758
Music stops and
starts here with me.

904
00:43:46.793 --> 00:43:50.275
Give me time to work with them.

905
00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:53.310
Don't interrupt.

906
00:43:53.344 --> 00:43:54.206
Got you.

907
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.172
Let's take it again.

908
00:43:58.206 --> 00:44:00.862
I'll make love to you.

909
00:44:18.068 --> 00:44:20.862
You know. Mitch.
when they build

910
00:44:20.896 --> 00:44:25.413
a skyscraper the first thing
they do is pour the footing.

911
00:44:25.448 --> 00:44:28.413
That's just like a
mound of concrete

912
00:44:28.448 --> 00:44:30.344
that the whole
building rests upon.

913
00:44:32.965 --> 00:44:34.896
Where is my tee?

914
00:44:34.931 --> 00:44:39.103
Sir. sorry. but we ran out.

915
00:44:39.137 --> 00:44:41.172
Well. you know
what that means.

916
00:44:41.206 --> 00:44:42.034
Sir?

917
00:44:45.931 --> 00:44:47.068
Well. that'll
teach you once again

918
00:44:47.103 --> 00:44:49.241
to have my golf bag stocked.

919
00:44:51.482 --> 00:44:54.172
I found out some
interesting information

920
00:44:54.206 --> 00:44:56.413
from a Greek life office.

921
00:44:56.448 --> 00:44:59.241
Seems that there's
been a motion to create

922
00:44:59.275 --> 00:45:02.103
a new fraternity on our campus.

923
00:45:06.206 --> 00:45:11.241
I want the names of
everyone on that list.

924
00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:14.000
Why?

925
00:45:14.034 --> 00:45:20.310
Because there hasn't been
a new frat here since 1980s.

926
00:45:20.344 --> 00:45:22.965
There's turbulence in the water.

927
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
I can sense it.

928
00:45:25.034 --> 00:45:29.000
Here. I want you to look at
this security camera footage.

929
00:45:29.034 --> 00:45:30.206
Security camera?

930
00:45:30.241 --> 00:45:31.275
I didn't know we had
security cameras.

931
00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:33.517
Oh. there's
cameras everywhere.

932
00:45:33.551 --> 00:45:35.310
I just want people to
believe that we're more

933
00:45:35.344 --> 00:45:39.965
traditional than technological.

934
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.344
Meh. his name is Vick.

935
00:45:42.379 --> 00:45:45.482
He's responsible
for the new frat.

936
00:45:45.517 --> 00:45:47.793
How do you know?

937
00:45:47.827 --> 00:45:50.896
Because he tagged
Prestige in all the

938
00:45:50.931 --> 00:45:53.172
the social media the other day.

939
00:45:53.206 --> 00:45:56.310
He's trying to recruit
students for the fraternity.

940
00:45:56.344 --> 00:46:00.034
That kid is public enemy
number one in my eyes.

941
00:46:00.068 --> 00:46:03.241
Now. look. you are
my eyes and my ears.

942
00:46:03.275 --> 00:46:06.379
and you dropped the
ball on this one.

943
00:46:06.413 --> 00:46:08.896
Now. listen. Mitch.
now I know you

944
00:46:08.931 --> 00:46:11.379
had a tough time in
high school. and you're

945
00:46:11.413 --> 00:46:14.172
still having a tough time now.

946
00:46:14.206 --> 00:46:18.310
But let me-- let me tell
you a little secret.

947
00:46:18.344 --> 00:46:22.103
so did I when I was younger.

948
00:46:22.137 --> 00:46:28.620
I know it's hard to believe I
was a bit of a nerd. but I was.

949
00:46:28.655 --> 00:46:35.068
And it's kids like Vick
who made my life miserable.

950
00:46:35.103 --> 00:46:39.034
You mean. Black kids?

951
00:46:39.068 --> 00:46:41.344
No. you idiot.

952
00:46:41.379 --> 00:46:45.517
The cool kids will never get
over on me again. nor you.

953
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:55.241
I am here to protect the
system or it'll go to trash.

954
00:46:55.275 --> 00:47:01.034
Now listen. I need the
names of all those students.

955
00:47:01.068 --> 00:47:03.310
Take them to the
Greek life office

956
00:47:03.344 --> 00:47:05.965
first thing Monday morning.

957
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.551
There's going to be a
change in the GLO policy.

958
00:47:17.344 --> 00:47:19.655
And you know what I realized?

959
00:47:19.689 --> 00:47:22.551
Life is. it's all
about the balance.

960
00:47:22.586 --> 00:47:25.103
It's all about the
push and the pull.

961
00:47:25.137 --> 00:47:29.137
It's. like. like. light to a
bulb. like water to a faucet.

962
00:47:29.172 --> 00:47:31.310
like an itch to a scratch.

963
00:47:31.344 --> 00:47:33.034
Life is really like a pancake.

964
00:47:33.068 --> 00:47:36.655
Sometimes you just got to flip
it up and drop it on down.

965
00:47:36.689 --> 00:47:40.586
And that. that is life.

966
00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:47.551
Bow stage left. bow stage
right. center. good night.

967
00:47:49.379 --> 00:47:50.206
What are you doing here?

968
00:47:50.241 --> 00:47:51.034
What'd you think?

969
00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:52.034
Amazing.

970
00:47:52.068 --> 00:47:53.068
Yeah?

971
00:47:53.103 --> 00:47:56.172
Absolutely amazing.

972
00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:58.413
What could you
possibly need me for?

973
00:47:58.448 --> 00:48:00.655
Well. I can submit
it now for a grade.

974
00:48:00.689 --> 00:48:03.068
or I can wait until you're
here and then we can

975
00:48:03.103 --> 00:48:05.172
work on improving it together.

976
00:48:05.206 --> 00:48:07.000
Together?

977
00:48:07.034 --> 00:48:09.137
Together.

978
00:48:09.172 --> 00:48:13.344
You need three people
to start a fraternity now.

979
00:48:13.379 --> 00:48:15.068
How did it change?

980
00:48:15.103 --> 00:48:17.137
Chancellor Davis said it
was something that GLO office

981
00:48:17.172 --> 00:48:20.482
wanted to do because some
frat in the '80s was started

982
00:48:20.517 --> 00:48:22.000
and it didn't work out well.
- That's garbage.

983
00:48:22.034 --> 00:48:23.413
I never heard about
that in admissions.

984
00:48:23.448 --> 00:48:26.137
He just changed it himself.

985
00:48:26.172 --> 00:48:28.206
But why?

986
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:30.655
That's how he is. I knew this.

987
00:48:30.689 --> 00:48:33.068
We can't get another
guy to join us.

988
00:48:33.103 --> 00:48:36.379
Besides. finding someone
who isn't already in a frat

989
00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:38.655
is near impossible anyway.

990
00:48:38.689 --> 00:48:40.379
If Chancellor Davis
keep changing the rules

991
00:48:40.413 --> 00:48:44.068
we have no hope. none.

992
00:48:44.103 --> 00:48:46.241
Wait. it's just three people.

993
00:48:46.275 --> 00:48:48.655
It says it right here. in order
to get this out fast and quick

994
00:48:48.689 --> 00:48:50.000
he didn't change
any of the words.

995
00:48:50.034 --> 00:48:51.517
he just changed the number.

996
00:48:51.551 --> 00:48:53.206
So if we can just find one more
person in this whole world.

997
00:48:53.241 --> 00:48:55.000
then boom. we're back on track.

998
00:48:55.034 --> 00:48:56.551
But who?

999
00:48:56.586 --> 00:48:59.689
It's not a matter of fact of
just throwing bodies up there.

1000
00:48:59.724 --> 00:49:02.241
We are competing
against some of the best

1001
00:49:02.275 --> 00:49:04.793
musical talent in the world.

1002
00:49:04.827 --> 00:49:08.551
We need someone who can sing.
someone with a voice that pulls

1003
00:49:08.586 --> 00:49:10.551
the emotion from the listener.

1004
00:49:10.586 --> 00:49:12.034
Singers that are
going to make you

1005
00:49:12.068 --> 00:49:13.793
want to jump out of
your seat and throw

1006
00:49:13.827 --> 00:49:15.241
your hands in the air.

1007
00:49:15.275 --> 00:49:19.344
But. what are you looking at?

1008
00:49:19.379 --> 00:49:20.724
I know that look.

1009
00:49:20.758 --> 00:49:22.206
She's got a plan
brewing up in there.

1010
00:49:22.241 --> 00:49:24.689
Divine intervention.

1011
00:49:27.689 --> 00:49:33.620
I'll praise.
I'll praise our God.

1012
00:49:33.655 --> 00:49:44.689
Yeah. I'll praise. his honor.
and all will see our praise.

1013
00:49:44.724 --> 00:49:45.551
Praise.

1014
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:53.275
The more he
do it. I love it.

1015
00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:54.206
He did it today.

1016
00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:55.034
All the time.

1017
00:49:55.068 --> 00:49:56.068
Hey!

1018
00:49:56.103 --> 00:49:57.379
Wasn't that a wonderful service?

1019
00:49:57.413 --> 00:49:58.206
Of course it was.

1020
00:49:58.241 --> 00:49:59.586
Great time.

1021
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:00.137
Yeah. we'll see
you all next Sunday.

1022
00:50:00.172 --> 00:50:01.103
See you next Sunday.

1023
00:50:01.137 --> 00:50:02.206
All right.

1024
00:50:02.241 --> 00:50:03.206
God bless you.

1025
00:50:03.241 --> 00:50:04.482
Have a blessed week.

1026
00:50:04.517 --> 00:50:07.482
You know something.
I have never in my life

1027
00:50:07.517 --> 00:50:09.379
seen Vicky more
excited to go to church

1028
00:50:09.413 --> 00:50:11.275
than she was this morning.

1029
00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:14.724
Shoot. I didn't even have to
break out my waffle batter.

1030
00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:19.034
What's itching you?

1031
00:50:19.068 --> 00:50:22.137
Ever since she started
spending time with Junior

1032
00:50:22.172 --> 00:50:23.724
I've noticed a change.

1033
00:50:23.758 --> 00:50:26.068
You know. start
dressing differently.

1034
00:50:26.103 --> 00:50:29.655
It's like her whole attitude
has done an about face.

1035
00:50:29.689 --> 00:50:31.793
Something's definitely
up. but as long

1036
00:50:31.827 --> 00:50:34.379
as she's going to
church. she's happy.

1037
00:50:34.413 --> 00:50:36.034
what more could a mama want?

1038
00:50:36.068 --> 00:50:37.103
Well. ain't that the truth?

1039
00:50:37.137 --> 00:50:37.758
Mm-hmm. amen.

1040
00:50:37.793 --> 00:50:39.689
Amen.

1041
00:50:39.724 --> 00:50:44.172
It's
turning around for me.

1042
00:50:46.655 --> 00:50:50.241
Oh. I didn't know
I had an audience.

1043
00:50:50.275 --> 00:50:52.137
Hey. guys.

1044
00:50:52.172 --> 00:50:53.103
What's up.

1045
00:50:53.137 --> 00:50:56.793
So did you get a message?

1046
00:50:56.827 --> 00:50:59.724
Partying and drinking
aren't really my thing.

1047
00:50:59.758 --> 00:51:01.689
No. no. no. no.
it's a music group.

1048
00:51:01.724 --> 00:51:04.379
We'll be performing
and singing songs.

1049
00:51:04.413 --> 00:51:06.241
The only reason we were
called a fraternity

1050
00:51:06.275 --> 00:51:09.206
is so that we can be
eligible to enter Music Fest.

1051
00:51:09.241 --> 00:51:11.344
Sounds a little underhanded.

1052
00:51:11.379 --> 00:51:14.310
You're not a guy. and you
definitely don't look the part.

1053
00:51:14.344 --> 00:51:15.482
No. it's not.

1054
00:51:15.517 --> 00:51:17.206
It's totally on the level.

1055
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:20.862
Listen. Vick. I bring
people to Christ through song.

1056
00:51:20.896 --> 00:51:22.620
That's my focus.

1057
00:51:22.655 --> 00:51:24.172
I wish you all the
best. but we're

1058
00:51:24.206 --> 00:51:27.344
on two different journeys.

1059
00:51:27.379 --> 00:51:29.379
Truth be told.
I'm in transition.

1060
00:51:29.413 --> 00:51:32.103
OK. that's a good start.

1061
00:51:32.137 --> 00:51:33.862
Turning a new leaf for God.

1062
00:51:33.896 --> 00:51:35.793
Good luck.

1063
00:51:35.827 --> 00:51:39.448
What if I told you I could
introduce you to Brian Moore?

1064
00:51:42.172 --> 00:51:42.793
Brian Moore?

1065
00:51:42.827 --> 00:51:44.103
Yeah.

1066
00:51:44.137 --> 00:51:45.344
How?

1067
00:51:45.379 --> 00:51:48.172
Well. he teaches
at Prestige. and he's

1068
00:51:48.206 --> 00:51:49.482
the host of Music Fest.

1069
00:51:49.517 --> 00:51:51.517
I mean. who knows. maybe
he's looking to put

1070
00:51:51.551 --> 00:51:53.862
out some Faith based singles.

1071
00:51:53.896 --> 00:51:57.103
I mean. just imagine the
exposure for the church.

1072
00:51:57.137 --> 00:51:58.551
And the only way
into this competition

1073
00:51:58.586 --> 00:51:59.793
is by being in a fraternity?

1074
00:51:59.827 --> 00:52:00.655
Yes. sir.

1075
00:52:00.689 --> 00:52:02.689
Do I look like I
have time for school

1076
00:52:02.724 --> 00:52:04.413
with all my responsibilities
here at the church?

1077
00:52:04.448 --> 00:52:07.586
Just think of it more as a
band than a frat. you know.

1078
00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.310
Pastor. talk about the pastor.

1079
00:52:09.344 --> 00:52:10.655
I'm sure-- I'm sure your
pastor would love for his youth

1080
00:52:10.689 --> 00:52:11.896
pastor to have more education.

1081
00:52:11.931 --> 00:52:12.724
Education. yeah.

1082
00:52:12.758 --> 00:52:14.206
Should we win.

1083
00:52:14.241 --> 00:52:17.586
If I sense anything
underhanded. I'm out.

1084
00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:22.206
I'm only doing this to
make music to save souls.

1085
00:52:22.241 --> 00:52:23.172
Deal?

1086
00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:25.172
Deal.

1087
00:52:28.758 --> 00:52:30.551
You're not
going to regret it.

1088
00:52:38.862 --> 00:52:41.275
Hey. Vicky. where
are you going?

1089
00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:41.931
Huh?

1090
00:52:41.965 --> 00:52:43.172
Huh?

1091
00:52:43.206 --> 00:52:46.344
You got the youth pastor from
the church and other kids

1092
00:52:46.379 --> 00:52:47.724
from Prestige downstairs.

1093
00:52:47.758 --> 00:52:49.827
What are you trying
to rope them into?

1094
00:52:49.862 --> 00:52:51.620
Dad's insurance
money is gone.

1095
00:52:51.655 --> 00:52:53.241
so I'm gonna solve
the problem myself.

1096
00:52:53.275 --> 00:52:55.758
Well. do me a favor.
while you're trying to solve

1097
00:52:55.793 --> 00:52:57.275
your problems. make
sure you're not

1098
00:52:57.310 --> 00:52:59.827
creating problems for others.

1099
00:52:59.862 --> 00:53:01.896
Yeah. you too.

1100
00:53:01.931 --> 00:53:03.241
Ouch.

1101
00:53:03.275 --> 00:53:04.586
You know what.

1102
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:07.655
Gwen. look. she's just
trying to find her way.

1103
00:53:07.689 --> 00:53:11.689
Let her be. just let her be.

1104
00:53:11.724 --> 00:53:13.000
This is the hard part
about being a mother.

1105
00:53:13.034 --> 00:53:15.793
but I'm gonna fallback
as they say. right?

1106
00:53:15.827 --> 00:53:16.655
Fall back.

1107
00:53:24.965 --> 00:53:27.413
That's a cool
mustache you have.

1108
00:53:27.448 --> 00:53:30.275
It's a nice pair
of skinny jeans.

1109
00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:33.655
Thanks. but they're not
actually skinny jeans.

1110
00:53:33.689 --> 00:53:35.482
They're just too tight on me.

1111
00:53:35.517 --> 00:53:37.000
I gained the freshman
five last year.

1112
00:53:37.034 --> 00:53:39.931
and oddly enough. a lot
of it went to my legs.

1113
00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:48.586
OK. we're all set up.

1114
00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:50.344
What are you doing?

1115
00:53:50.379 --> 00:53:52.241
Mr. Moore says to tape all
rehearsals so you can not only

1116
00:53:52.275 --> 00:53:54.000
play it back to listen
with a fresh ear.

1117
00:53:54.034 --> 00:53:56.551
but to see your body
mechanics while singing.

1118
00:53:56.586 --> 00:53:58.241
He's right.

1119
00:53:58.275 --> 00:54:02.413
So what are we singing?

1120
00:54:02.448 --> 00:54:05.448
Got something for you.

1121
00:54:07.413 --> 00:54:11.344
Makes me high. one
for the money. two for the ride.

1122
00:54:11.379 --> 00:54:13.689
three for
put me into the sunshine.

1123
00:54:13.724 --> 00:54:17.034
Dope. old school.

1124
00:54:17.068 --> 00:54:19.586
Comes in my back.
so tuck that ass

1125
00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:21.551
take her from the back.

1126
00:54:21.586 --> 00:54:23.482
MLB from the cradle
to the grave.

1127
00:54:23.517 --> 00:54:24.551
What is this?

1128
00:54:24.586 --> 00:54:27.310
Music makes me high?

1129
00:54:27.344 --> 00:54:29.310
Yeah. what's the problem?

1130
00:54:29.344 --> 00:54:30.655
It's secular.

1131
00:54:30.689 --> 00:54:32.655
I thought this was
a Christian thing.

1132
00:54:32.689 --> 00:54:35.655
No. no. no. no. no.
we're singing pop music.

1133
00:54:35.689 --> 00:54:37.689
I'm talking about the
kind of stuff that sells

1134
00:54:37.724 --> 00:54:39.482
worldwide and gains attention.

1135
00:54:39.517 --> 00:54:41.344
I see.

1136
00:54:41.379 --> 00:54:42.344
I'm out of here.

1137
00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:44.379
Wait. where are you going?

1138
00:54:44.413 --> 00:54:45.448
Come on.

1139
00:54:45.482 --> 00:54:46.689
Come on. man.

1140
00:54:46.724 --> 00:54:47.827
Come on. bro. don't do this.

1141
00:54:47.862 --> 00:54:50.310
Yo. Ty. just give it a try. man.

1142
00:54:50.344 --> 00:54:52.517
What's the big deal?

1143
00:54:52.551 --> 00:54:55.896
Bro. come on.

1144
00:54:55.931 --> 00:54:58.758
I've been given a gift. and
I want to use it properly.

1145
00:54:58.793 --> 00:55:01.931
I'm sorry you guys
don't understand that.

1146
00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:03.137
but the only reason
I came down here

1147
00:55:03.172 --> 00:55:04.827
is because I thought
you were preparing

1148
00:55:04.862 --> 00:55:08.793
to sing songs of empowerment.
not evil thinking songs.

1149
00:55:08.827 --> 00:55:10.103
Understand something. Ty.

1150
00:55:10.137 --> 00:55:12.137
We can't take the
competition on the stage--

1151
00:55:12.172 --> 00:55:14.413
Listen. listen. no. no.
no just go with gospel. OK.

1152
00:55:14.448 --> 00:55:15.896
Just go with gospel.

1153
00:55:15.931 --> 00:55:19.034
OK. OK. all right.
Ty. gospel song it is.

1154
00:55:19.068 --> 00:55:19.896
What?

1155
00:55:19.931 --> 00:55:21.517
Chill.

1156
00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:22.758
Really?

1157
00:55:22.793 --> 00:55:24.827
Why the change of heart?

1158
00:55:24.862 --> 00:55:26.103
I mean. you're right.

1159
00:55:26.137 --> 00:55:27.896
What better opportunity
to get God's message

1160
00:55:27.931 --> 00:55:29.103
to a group of college kids?

1161
00:55:29.137 --> 00:55:30.034
So let's do it.

1162
00:55:30.068 --> 00:55:30.931
Yeah.

1163
00:55:36.068 --> 00:55:44.724
When I die. hallelujah
by and by. oh fly away.

1164
00:55:44.758 --> 00:55:46.379
Beautiful.
beautiful. guys.

1165
00:55:46.413 --> 00:55:47.620
That was great.

1166
00:55:47.655 --> 00:55:49.620
Vicky. just head up.
looking out here.

1167
00:55:49.655 --> 00:55:51.551
Mitch. just stay in
pitch with Ty. OK?

1168
00:55:51.586 --> 00:55:54.034
Do whatever he does. simple.

1169
00:55:54.068 --> 00:55:55.724
All right. guys.
look at the time.

1170
00:55:55.758 --> 00:55:56.551
I got to go.
Same time tomorrow?

1171
00:55:56.586 --> 00:55:57.586
Yes.

1172
00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:58.724
Me too.

1173
00:55:58.758 --> 00:56:01.137
Look. you did great. OK.

1174
00:56:01.172 --> 00:56:01.655
Thank you.

1175
00:56:01.689 --> 00:56:02.655
See you tomorrow.

1176
00:56:02.689 --> 00:56:04.689
OK. see you.

1177
00:56:04.724 --> 00:56:06.620
Not bad for our first
crack at it. huh?

1178
00:56:06.655 --> 00:56:07.965
Are you insane?

1179
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.034
We sounded like a Sunday
school choir up there.

1180
00:56:10.068 --> 00:56:12.482
We have no chance
of winning this.

1181
00:56:12.517 --> 00:56:15.172
This competition is
about the real world.

1182
00:56:15.206 --> 00:56:18.965
Nobody ever performs
Faith based music.

1183
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.551
Which is exactly why
we're going to do it.

1184
00:56:22.586 --> 00:56:26.034
Listen. to get noticed. we
have to do something different.

1185
00:56:26.068 --> 00:56:27.965
We have to stand
out from the crowd.

1186
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.517
Chancellor Davis is going
to flip his underwear inside

1187
00:56:30.551 --> 00:56:33.137
out when he gets wind of this.

1188
00:56:33.172 --> 00:56:34.931
Which is exactly why
we're not going to tell

1189
00:56:34.965 --> 00:56:36.551
him until we take the stage.

1190
00:56:36.586 --> 00:56:38.965
It's going to work. Mitch.

1191
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Gospel music. it's stupid.

1192
00:56:43.034 --> 00:56:47.000
Bro. between me and you.
I don't buy it neither.

1193
00:56:47.034 --> 00:56:48.137
God didn't stop
my dad from dying

1194
00:56:48.172 --> 00:56:50.793
and he ain't paying
for Prestige for me.

1195
00:56:50.827 --> 00:56:52.793
Look. Ty's a youth
pastor and Junior.

1196
00:56:52.827 --> 00:56:55.103
he seems to be buying it.

1197
00:56:55.137 --> 00:56:57.482
So I have to play up
the Christian angle

1198
00:56:57.517 --> 00:56:59.793
to keep them both on board.

1199
00:56:59.827 --> 00:57:02.241
In reality. it's all nonsense.

1200
00:57:02.275 --> 00:57:05.034
But for the people who
buy this Christian stuff.

1201
00:57:05.068 --> 00:57:08.724
this music gets
them so motivated.

1202
00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:11.275
Man. you got to think about
it. the controversy surrounding

1203
00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:14.551
a song selection like this
will guarantee the whole campus

1204
00:57:14.586 --> 00:57:17.034
will know who I am and
what I've come to do.

1205
00:57:17.068 --> 00:57:20.896
Listen. Mitch. when this is
over. we're going to be stars.

1206
00:57:20.931 --> 00:57:23.172
And if Davis tries
anything after this.

1207
00:57:23.206 --> 00:57:24.551
it's only going to
make us bigger stars.

1208
00:57:24.586 --> 00:57:25.586
OK?

1209
00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:26.620
OK.

1210
00:57:26.655 --> 00:57:27.137
Come on.

1211
00:57:33.758 --> 00:57:36.034
VICKY Between me
and you. I don't buy it either.

1212
00:57:36.068 --> 00:57:37.000
God didn't stop
my dad from dying

1213
00:57:37.034 --> 00:57:39.793
and he ain't paying
for Prestige for me.

1214
00:57:39.827 --> 00:57:41.965
Look. Ty's a youth
pastor. and Junior. he

1215
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.137
seems to be buying it.

1216
00:57:44.172 --> 00:57:46.517
So we have to put up
the Christian angle

1217
00:57:46.551 --> 00:57:48.068
to keep them both on board.

1218
00:57:48.103 --> 00:57:50.896
In reality. it's all nonsense.

1219
00:57:50.931 --> 00:57:53.206
But for the people who
buy this Christmas stuff.

1220
00:58:05.034 --> 00:58:06.827
Thank you very much. sir.

1221
00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:39.793
There is something
terrible in my golf cart.

1222
00:58:39.827 --> 00:58:42.758
I-- I was just I--

1223
00:58:42.793 --> 00:58:43.758
Take a look. Mitch.

1224
00:58:46.965 --> 00:58:50.275
Look. look closer.

1225
00:58:53.827 --> 00:58:56.206
What is it?

1226
00:58:56.241 --> 00:58:59.241
Mouse droppings.

1227
00:58:59.275 --> 00:59:03.310
So all of a sudden we have
rodent problems in our garage.

1228
00:59:09.275 --> 00:59:13.724
The thought of a rodent
sneaking around this place

1229
00:59:13.758 --> 00:59:17.241
when no one's looking
makes me want to cringe.

1230
00:59:20.172 --> 00:59:26.931
I want it killed as
fast as possible.

1231
00:59:26.965 --> 00:59:32.206
Then we can go back to normal.
like nothing ever happened.

1232
00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:37.034
Because if there's
one thing I hate.

1233
00:59:37.068 --> 00:59:39.344
it's a rodent in my presence.

1234
00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:58.172
Mmm-mm.

1235
00:59:58.206 --> 01:00:00.034
Is uncle
Ken working late?

1236
01:00:00.068 --> 01:00:01.379
No. he'll be here.

1237
01:00:01.413 --> 01:00:02.827
Pull up a chair for him.

1238
01:00:06.862 --> 01:00:08.896
Hello. mother.

1239
01:00:08.931 --> 01:00:11.103
It looks great.

1240
01:00:11.137 --> 01:00:15.310
So mom. if I sit
him right here.

1241
01:00:15.344 --> 01:00:18.206
Uncle Ken gonna
talk his head off.

1242
01:00:18.241 --> 01:00:21.689
But if I sit him over there.
then I'll be too far away.

1243
01:00:21.724 --> 01:00:26.689
So I thought about just
flipping or switching

1244
01:00:26.724 --> 01:00:30.241
grandma. or bumping her down.

1245
01:00:30.275 --> 01:00:33.931
But then if she has
to go to the kitchen

1246
01:00:33.965 --> 01:00:35.758
he'll have to squeeze by you.

1247
01:00:35.793 --> 01:00:38.655
So I thought about flipping
Uncle Ken and grandma.

1248
01:00:38.689 --> 01:00:40.034
Hmm.

1249
01:00:40.068 --> 01:00:44.000
But then if he needs
more sauce. it'll be close.

1250
01:00:44.034 --> 01:00:46.724
But then he can't
reach the knees.

1251
01:00:46.758 --> 01:00:47.206
See.

1252
01:00:50.172 --> 01:00:54.379
There's actually
an easy solution.

1253
01:00:54.413 --> 01:00:55.206
What is it?

1254
01:00:55.241 --> 01:00:58.172
Why don't you
sit in dad's seat?

1255
01:00:58.206 --> 01:00:58.620
Me?

1256
01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:01.896
Yes. you. Vicky.

1257
01:01:01.931 --> 01:01:03.000
I guess so.

1258
01:01:13.827 --> 01:01:14.896
Ta-da!

1259
01:01:14.931 --> 01:01:15.965
Come here.

1260
01:01:19.448 --> 01:01:21.344
Easy. mom. easy.

1261
01:01:21.379 --> 01:01:23.448
Are you OK?

1262
01:01:23.482 --> 01:01:25.000
Yeah. I'm OK.

1263
01:01:28.068 --> 01:01:30.965
Grandma Ro used to tell
me that your father.

1264
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.206
the first time I came over for
dinner. he was a nervous wreck.

1265
01:01:34.241 --> 01:01:37.275
He set and then reset the
table for like an hour.

1266
01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:39.103
He wanted everything
to be perfect.

1267
01:01:39.137 --> 01:01:41.896
He was nervous just like you.

1268
01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:42.931
I'm not nervous.

1269
01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:44.172
I just want everything to be--

1270
01:01:44.206 --> 01:01:46.103
Perfect.

1271
01:01:46.137 --> 01:01:47.793
Yeah.

1272
01:01:47.827 --> 01:01:49.068
Perfect.

1273
01:01:49.103 --> 01:01:52.413
Truth is. I didn't
even notice the table.

1274
01:01:52.448 --> 01:01:54.310
When the connection
is there. nothing

1275
01:01:54.344 --> 01:02:04.275
else matters but the way
they smile when they see you.

1276
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:06.344
the way their brows moves
when they let you know they

1277
01:02:06.379 --> 01:02:10.206
interesting. the way
they take in a breath

1278
01:02:10.241 --> 01:02:11.379
just before they laugh.

1279
01:02:15.448 --> 01:02:19.310
When you find that
person. Vicky.

1280
01:02:19.344 --> 01:02:22.068
that plate ain't
gonna even matter.

1281
01:02:22.103 --> 01:02:22.931
Ain't that right?

1282
01:02:22.965 --> 01:02:25.482
Amen. amen.

1283
01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:46.413
OK. here we go.
last but not least.

1284
01:02:46.448 --> 01:02:47.896
Oh. look at that.

1285
01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:49.793
Some ziti.

1286
01:02:49.827 --> 01:02:51.137
Oh. that looks good.

1287
01:02:51.172 --> 01:02:52.172
Hey. brother. let's dig in.

1288
01:02:52.206 --> 01:02:53.068
This is already so good.

1289
01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:54.344
Thank you so much.

1290
01:02:54.379 --> 01:02:55.827
Oh. you know. it
needs a little pepper.

1291
01:02:55.862 --> 01:02:57.103
Here. take some.
- Ken!

1292
01:02:57.137 --> 01:02:59.172
You better not throw
no pepper at nobody.

1293
01:02:59.206 --> 01:03:00.896
Come on. that's not
how we treat company.

1294
01:03:00.931 --> 01:03:04.379
All right. I'm not gonna
throw it. come on now.

1295
01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:06.172
I can look at
Junior and tell he's

1296
01:03:06.206 --> 01:03:10.068
a man that knows about things
being thrown around the table.

1297
01:03:10.103 --> 01:03:11.379
Am I right. Junior?

1298
01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:12.517
Yes. sir. I have four
sisters. so there's

1299
01:03:12.551 --> 01:03:14.965
not much I haven't seen
thrown around the room. sir.

1300
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.172
You know. I used
to date a girl

1301
01:03:16.206 --> 01:03:17.137
who had four older sisters.

1302
01:03:17.172 --> 01:03:18.379
Yeah?

1303
01:03:18.413 --> 01:03:21.034
Longest two days of my life.

1304
01:03:21.068 --> 01:03:24.241
Well. Uncle Ken. Junior's
not like your typical Prestige

1305
01:03:24.275 --> 01:03:25.172
crowd.

1306
01:03:25.206 --> 01:03:26.172
He's actually normal.

1307
01:03:26.206 --> 01:03:28.586
Oh. I beg to differ. Vicky.

1308
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.344
If he was normal he
wouldn't be sitting here

1309
01:03:30.379 --> 01:03:32.000
at this table with this family.

1310
01:03:32.034 --> 01:03:33.034
Oh. stop it.

1311
01:03:33.068 --> 01:03:34.551
Uncle Ken.

1312
01:03:34.586 --> 01:03:36.379
And look. Junior. don't you
let Ken scare you. you hear?

1313
01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:39.206
You know those old
inflatable guys that go up

1314
01:03:39.241 --> 01:03:40.586
and down in the used car lots?

1315
01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:41.586
Yes.

1316
01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:44.551
Well. he is our version
of that in our family.

1317
01:03:44.586 --> 01:03:45.413
I'm retired though.

1318
01:03:45.448 --> 01:03:48.896
Well.
that's good to know.

1319
01:03:48.931 --> 01:03:54.068
So. is Prestige as amazing
as what Vicky tells us?

1320
01:03:54.103 --> 01:03:56.241
Probably more so. which is
why I'm sure she has a chance

1321
01:03:56.275 --> 01:03:57.551
to win that scholarship.

1322
01:03:57.586 --> 01:03:59.034
And Sir The Baptist.
they brought him into--

1323
01:03:59.068 --> 01:03:59.896
Uh. baby?

1324
01:03:59.931 --> 01:04:01.068
Hmm?

1325
01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.310
Who's Sir the Baptist?

1326
01:04:02.344 --> 01:04:03.310
Oh. Chancellor
Davis brought him

1327
01:04:03.344 --> 01:04:05.103
in to revamp the music program.

1328
01:04:05.137 --> 01:04:07.310
Yeah. him and Chancellor Davis
butt heads from time to time.

1329
01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:10.172
but it's all good though.

1330
01:04:10.206 --> 01:04:11.413
Thank you for
everything you've done.

1331
01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:12.379
Of course. it's my pleasure.

1332
01:04:12.413 --> 01:04:14.034
I mean. she belongs there.

1333
01:04:14.068 --> 01:04:16.000
The teacher of one of my
performing elective classes.

1334
01:04:16.034 --> 01:04:20.344
they said pop stars are
built off of training. God

1335
01:04:20.379 --> 01:04:22.379
given talent. and it factor.

1336
01:04:22.413 --> 01:04:23.931
Oh.

1337
01:04:23.965 --> 01:04:26.655
I don't know about that.
but Vicky definitely has it.

1338
01:04:26.689 --> 01:04:29.448
I can tell from the
first moment I met her.

1339
01:04:29.482 --> 01:04:32.103
And all of you know that she's
got the god given talent. so

1340
01:04:32.137 --> 01:04:33.172
just with a little
more training.

1341
01:04:33.206 --> 01:04:34.413
there won't be no stopping her.

1342
01:04:34.448 --> 01:04:35.551
Your family lives in?

1343
01:04:35.586 --> 01:04:36.068
Pennsylvania.

1344
01:04:36.103 --> 01:04:37.068
Pennsylvania. oh.

1345
01:04:37.103 --> 01:04:38.310
Yeah.

1346
01:04:38.344 --> 01:04:40.034
Whoa. that's kind of far away.

1347
01:04:40.068 --> 01:04:41.241
So you know what. you think
of us as your second family?

1348
01:04:41.275 --> 01:04:42.172
That's right.

1349
01:04:42.206 --> 01:04:43.310
Thank you. Mrs. Waters.

1350
01:04:43.344 --> 01:04:45.448
You're welcome.
anything you need.

1351
01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:48.586
You know. there is one thing.

1352
01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:51.034
What's that?

1353
01:04:51.068 --> 01:04:52.137
You all going to
church tomorrow?

1354
01:04:52.172 --> 01:04:53.206
You bet we are.

1355
01:04:53.241 --> 01:04:55.034
You think I could come?

1356
01:04:55.068 --> 01:04:56.586
Of course. you don't even
have to ask. sweetheart.

1357
01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:59.586
That's right. nobody
needs to RSVP to the Lord.

1358
01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:00.482
Amen.

1359
01:05:00.517 --> 01:05:01.344
Amen.

1360
01:05:01.379 --> 01:05:04.103
Junior. you sure
you want to do that?

1361
01:05:04.137 --> 01:05:06.551
Yeah. I do.

1362
01:05:06.586 --> 01:05:08.482
I mean. unless that's a problem.

1363
01:05:08.517 --> 01:05:09.379
Mm-mm.

1364
01:05:09.413 --> 01:05:11.103
None. none whatsoever.

1365
01:05:11.137 --> 01:05:12.551
Nice.

1366
01:05:12.586 --> 01:05:13.793
Well. it's just the
songs that you. Ty.

1367
01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:15.000
and Mitch have been rehearsing
are really inspirational.

1368
01:05:15.034 --> 01:05:16.206
you know.

1369
01:05:16.241 --> 01:05:18.413
I figured I'd check
them out if I could.

1370
01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:20.482
But it's not just going
to be a song service.

1371
01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:22.103
It's going to be
another hour of sermon.

1372
01:05:22.137 --> 01:05:23.310
That's fine.

1373
01:05:23.344 --> 01:05:25.310
I want the full experience.

1374
01:05:25.344 --> 01:05:27.034
Well. good. because
our reverend preach.

1375
01:05:27.068 --> 01:05:28.034
Yeah?

1376
01:05:28.068 --> 01:05:29.241
Amen.

1377
01:05:29.275 --> 01:05:31.103
I'm gonna check him out then.

1378
01:05:31.137 --> 01:05:35.482
Folks don't usually
decide when to go to church.

1379
01:05:35.517 --> 01:05:38.172
life decides it for them.

1380
01:05:38.206 --> 01:05:39.344
What do you mean?

1381
01:05:39.379 --> 01:05:41.551
Well.
sometimes honey.

1382
01:05:41.586 --> 01:05:44.310
people have to hit bottom
before they realize

1383
01:05:44.344 --> 01:05:46.206
how important God is to them.

1384
01:05:46.241 --> 01:05:50.551
But I tell you this. when they
take God into their lives.

1385
01:05:50.586 --> 01:05:53.724
it's the best decision
they can ever make.

1386
01:05:55.344 --> 01:05:58.379
Can't nobody
do me like you. Jesus.

1387
01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:02.241
Can't nobody do me
like you. Jesus.

1388
01:06:02.275 --> 01:06:05.551
Can't nobody do
me like the Lord.

1389
01:06:05.586 --> 01:06:09.620
Can't nobody do me
like you. Jesus.

1390
01:06:09.655 --> 01:06:12.724
And I give you glory.
I give you glory. yeah.

1391
01:06:12.758 --> 01:06:15.793

01:06:21.586 --> 01:06:25.413
Can't nobody do me
like the Lord. yeah.

1396
01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:28.724
Can't nobody do me
like you. Jesus.

1397
01:06:28.758 --> 01:06:31.034
I give you glory. I
give you glory. yeah.

1398
01:06:31.068 --> 01:06:35.482
Hey hey. I give you
glory. I give you glory.

01:06:35.517 --> 01:06:36.758

I give you glory.

1405
01:06:45.413 --> 01:06:47.275
It's already mine.
it's already mine.

1406
01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:48.379
Hey. hey. hey.

1407
01:06:51.482 --> 01:06:53.034
Gwen. this is Mr. Richard.

1408
01:06:53.068 --> 01:06:56.241
Reynolds he's the head of
our appeals department.

1409
01:06:56.275 --> 01:06:58.172
Nice to meet you.

1410
01:06:58.206 --> 01:07:00.827
Mrs. Waters. well. I'd like
you to know that our appeals

1411
01:07:00.862 --> 01:07:05.379
department. we have done a
careful analysis of your case.

1412
01:07:05.413 --> 01:07:09.137
and I want you to
understand that we've

1413
01:07:09.172 --> 01:07:12.448
given significantly more time
to your claim than our others.

1414
01:07:12.482 --> 01:07:16.310
And our reps. they
put in over 60 hours

1415
01:07:16.344 --> 01:07:21.275
to ensure that we were in line
with your husband's insurance

1416
01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:23.482
agreement.

1417
01:07:23.517 --> 01:07:26.793
Thank you for the meeting.

1418
01:07:26.827 --> 01:07:29.344
Can I call you Richard?

1419
01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:31.344
Most definitely.

1420
01:07:31.379 --> 01:07:32.482
Are you married?

1421
01:07:32.517 --> 01:07:33.551
Happily married.

1422
01:07:36.517 --> 01:07:40.724
Excuse me for being
Frank. but Richard.

1423
01:07:40.758 --> 01:07:43.827
hours don't bring
my husband back.

1424
01:07:43.862 --> 01:07:48.275
My life has been turned
upside down since his death.

1425
01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:54.310
and your insurance denial
has handcuffed my family.

1426
01:07:54.344 --> 01:07:57.344
You have to understand that
my husband Robert was my--

1427
01:08:01.482 --> 01:08:08.413
he was my best friend. my lover.
and my provider. and he's gone.

1428
01:08:11.482 --> 01:08:17.379
And just like that. just like
that. I knew me coming here.

1429
01:08:17.413 --> 01:08:18.862
nothing would get done.

1430
01:08:18.896 --> 01:08:22.206
Nothing would get done.
because all you big insurance

1431
01:08:22.241 --> 01:08:26.241
company do is let the little
man know that he means nothing.

1432
01:08:26.275 --> 01:08:27.275
Do you understand?

1433
01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:30.758
Stop. Blake. sit down. Blake.

1434
01:08:30.793 --> 01:08:33.241
I'm trying to
figure this all out.

1435
01:08:33.275 --> 01:08:34.862
All right.

1436
01:08:34.896 --> 01:08:35.827
Richard is on our--

1437
01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:36.793
Richard is what?

1438
01:08:40.482 --> 01:08:45.379
Mrs. Waters. on
a personal note.

1439
01:08:45.413 --> 01:08:47.724
I have two small
children as well.

1440
01:08:47.758 --> 01:08:52.344
and our company only wants
the best for our clients.

1441
01:08:52.379 --> 01:08:56.310
And sometimes there's a
lapse. sometimes it happens.

1442
01:08:56.344 --> 01:08:59.827
But I just want you to
know. we're here to help.

1443
01:08:59.862 --> 01:09:05.827
No. my
prayers aren't yours.

1444
01:09:05.862 --> 01:09:08.655
We come from the blood.
where we dodge cars.

1445
01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:12.862
and pray through open doors.

1446
01:09:12.896 --> 01:09:16.241
Tell me if there's a room
for Jesus in the ghetto.

1447
01:09:16.275 --> 01:09:19.551
Tell me if there's room
for Jesus in the ghetto.

1448
01:09:19.586 --> 01:09:21.931
Tell me if there's room.

1449
01:09:21.965 --> 01:09:24.241
I need to know if
there's a place for me

1450
01:09:24.275 --> 01:09:25.586
somewhere in the ghetto.

1451
01:10:43.965 --> 01:10:46.310
Grandma. I don't think
she heard me. guys.

1452
01:10:46.344 --> 01:10:47.275
Oh no?

1453
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:49.413
Yeah. I'll be right back.

1454
01:10:49.448 --> 01:10:50.896
Got it?

1455
01:10:50.931 --> 01:10:52.689
All right.

1456
01:10:52.724 --> 01:10:54.586
Then we got through
it all. didn't we?

1457
01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:58.413
I tell you what. he
is so good to us.

1458
01:10:58.448 --> 01:10:59.344
All the time.

1459
01:10:59.379 --> 01:11:00.793
All the time.

1460
01:11:00.827 --> 01:11:01.965
Hey.

1461
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.724
What happened?

1462
01:11:03.758 --> 01:11:05.965
Nothing sweetheart. just
the same old. same old.

1463
01:11:09.344 --> 01:11:10.310
I'm so sorry.

1464
01:11:10.344 --> 01:11:13.034
Oh. don't be. sweetheart.

1465
01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:16.034
I was feeling like a truck
hit me. so I went out

1466
01:11:16.068 --> 01:11:18.310
and I got me some air.

1467
01:11:18.344 --> 01:11:23.034
And when I came back. I
was climbing those steps

1468
01:11:23.068 --> 01:11:29.310
and I could hear you and your
friends glorifying God's name.

1469
01:11:29.344 --> 01:11:32.551
And you know what
that made me realize?

1470
01:11:32.586 --> 01:11:33.931
We're going to be OK.

1471
01:11:33.965 --> 01:11:38.551
You got to understand.
this was all God's plan.

1472
01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:40.655
Yeah. we may have
lost your father.

1473
01:11:40.689 --> 01:11:42.827
We may have lost income.

1474
01:11:42.862 --> 01:11:44.586
We may have lost opportunities.

1475
01:11:48.034 --> 01:11:53.344
But look what we've gained.
look what you gained.

1476
01:11:53.379 --> 01:11:55.551
So I want you to keep
on singing. you hear me?

1477
01:11:55.586 --> 01:11:56.551
Amen.

1478
01:11:56.586 --> 01:11:59.310
You keep on singing.

1479
01:11:59.344 --> 01:12:00.551
Every day.

1480
01:12:00.586 --> 01:12:01.482
- Yes.
- When I wake up.

1481
01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:02.379
Come on. now.

1482
01:12:02.413 --> 01:12:02.931
OK.

1483
01:12:02.965 --> 01:12:04.413
Come on.

1484
01:12:04.448 --> 01:12:08.862
I can see
mercy's all around me.

1485
01:12:08.896 --> 01:12:11.896
And then the circles fade.

1486
01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:21.068
I'm changing the
rules to Music Fest.

1487
01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:21.965
Why?

1488
01:12:25.172 --> 01:12:28.965
Singing gospel music will
not happen on my watch.

1489
01:12:33.724 --> 01:12:37.551
Listen. I have a salary.

1490
01:12:37.586 --> 01:12:40.034
I have medical benefits.

1491
01:12:40.068 --> 01:12:43.379
I have all the free
golf I can handle.

1492
01:12:43.413 --> 01:12:45.862
This is big business.

1493
01:12:45.896 --> 01:12:47.965
I don't have any
room for church.

1494
01:12:51.965 --> 01:12:55.034
And all it would take
is one kid to complain

1495
01:12:55.068 --> 01:12:57.482
and this whole
thing could ignite

1496
01:12:57.517 --> 01:13:00.137
like a California wildfire.

1497
01:13:00.172 --> 01:13:04.758
Music Fest is supposed
to be for all music.

1498
01:13:04.793 --> 01:13:08.103
Yes. in a perfect world.

1499
01:13:08.137 --> 01:13:10.517
But in the real
world. Music Fest

1500
01:13:10.551 --> 01:13:14.103
is a cash cow. bringing
in mountains of funding

1501
01:13:14.137 --> 01:13:17.034
and keeping me on
top of the world.

1502
01:13:17.068 --> 01:13:20.517
And I am going to ride it
until the wheels fall off.

1503
01:13:20.551 --> 01:13:22.689
Well. what about Mitch?

1504
01:13:22.724 --> 01:13:27.172
When he's not cleaning the
golf cart or making the copies.

1505
01:13:27.206 --> 01:13:30.896
he is a good student.

1506
01:13:30.931 --> 01:13:33.448
Let me put it this way.
do you enjoy this course?

1507
01:13:33.482 --> 01:13:34.965
Yes.

1508
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.896
Yes. yes. well. if
there's controversy

1509
01:13:36.931 --> 01:13:40.000
the sponsors will
distance themselves.

1510
01:13:40.034 --> 01:13:42.172
And it is the sponsors
who helped fund

1511
01:13:42.206 --> 01:13:46.517
these big perks. such as
this place and the golf

1512
01:13:46.551 --> 01:13:48.931
course and new buildings.

1513
01:13:48.965 --> 01:13:53.689
Safe and steady is what we want.

1514
01:13:53.724 --> 01:13:58.724
And I am not going to allow
anyone to adjust my lifestyle.

1515
01:13:58.758 --> 01:14:01.931
including anyone
singing gospel music.

1516
01:14:01.965 --> 01:14:07.172
However. that is not
advancement for education.

1517
01:14:07.206 --> 01:14:09.896
Vick Waters is not
even a student here.

1518
01:14:09.931 --> 01:14:12.068
No scholarship. no entry.

1519
01:14:12.103 --> 01:14:16.517
Now. Mr. Moore. your job
here is to teach music.

1520
01:14:16.551 --> 01:14:18.172
Mine is to run this school.

1521
01:14:18.206 --> 01:14:21.793
And I tell you right now. I
am not allowing those students

1522
01:14:21.827 --> 01:14:24.827
to step on stage and
sing religious music.

1523
01:14:24.862 --> 01:14:26.758
that I guarantee.

1524
01:14:30.172 --> 01:14:33.137
Got it.

1525
01:14:40.551 --> 01:14:41.517
What's up. champ?

1526
01:14:41.551 --> 01:14:42.137
What's up?

1527
01:14:42.172 --> 01:14:45.103
You nervous?

1528
01:14:45.137 --> 01:14:48.068
My whole life
rides on Music Fest.

1529
01:14:48.103 --> 01:14:49.034
I have to win.

1530
01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:51.206
Don't put that much
weight on yourself.

1531
01:14:51.241 --> 01:14:52.068
But it's true.

1532
01:14:56.068 --> 01:15:01.620
This. my dad gave it
to little before dying.

1533
01:15:01.655 --> 01:15:04.931
This right here. it's
all I have left of him.

1534
01:15:04.965 --> 01:15:06.965
Vicky. you're wrong.

1535
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.931
You have a totally
complete family.

1536
01:15:11.965 --> 01:15:14.965
This speck of blood
is not your father.

1537
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.068
His values are around you
and your whole family.

1538
01:15:19.103 --> 01:15:22.068
As long as you're looking
at something that small.

1539
01:15:22.103 --> 01:15:25.931
you're never gonna see it.

1540
01:15:25.965 --> 01:15:30.655
Yeah. I'm willing to
sell my soul to win.

1541
01:15:30.689 --> 01:15:32.275
I don't think my dad
would be too proud of me.

1542
01:15:35.862 --> 01:15:39.862
Listen to me. my parents--

1543
01:15:42.103 --> 01:15:45.793
my parents divorced this summer.

1544
01:15:45.827 --> 01:15:47.689
They're atheists.

1545
01:15:47.724 --> 01:15:49.862
My sisters said that
they're never going to get

1546
01:15:49.896 --> 01:15:51.206
married and never have kids.

1547
01:15:55.275 --> 01:16:01.034
They're all so selfish. so
distant from each other.

1548
01:16:01.068 --> 01:16:06.379
A family like yours. that's
what I've always wanted.

1549
01:16:06.413 --> 01:16:08.827
Look. hold this up. OK?

1550
01:16:11.896 --> 01:16:17.965
This little dot. is eclipsing
the sunlight in your life.

1551
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.137
Don't let it. OK?

1552
01:16:21.172 --> 01:16:24.379
Your father wouldn't want
you to. I don't either.

1553
01:16:28.034 --> 01:16:31.827
OK. the wisdom
of an older man.

1554
01:16:31.862 --> 01:16:33.103
Oh. so. now you
got jokes. huh?

1555
01:16:33.137 --> 01:16:35.793
Little bit. little bit.

1556
01:16:35.827 --> 01:16:41.000
Listen. regardless of what
happens. you always got me.

1557
01:16:57.241 --> 01:16:58.068
Ow!

1558
01:17:04.413 --> 01:17:07.724
What is taking you so
long to set these traps?

1559
01:17:07.758 --> 01:17:09.931
How many have you set?

1560
01:17:09.965 --> 01:17:12.172
Including these?

1561
01:17:12.206 --> 01:17:14.724
Two.

1562
01:17:14.758 --> 01:17:18.931
Well. listen. Mitch. I
have some bad news for you.

1563
01:17:18.965 --> 01:17:21.827
Tomorrow you are
going to be expelled.

1564
01:17:21.862 --> 01:17:22.448
What?

1565
01:17:22.482 --> 01:17:23.482
Why?

1566
01:17:23.517 --> 01:17:26.793
I found out about your
little song selection.

1567
01:17:26.827 --> 01:17:30.034
And being that you are the
only Prestige student that

1568
01:17:30.068 --> 01:17:32.724
is a part of Alpha
Chiro. well. you're

1569
01:17:32.758 --> 01:17:35.068
the only one I have
authority to preside

1570
01:17:35.103 --> 01:17:37.724
disciplinary action over.

1571
01:17:37.758 --> 01:17:39.241
It's just a song. sir.

1572
01:17:39.275 --> 01:17:43.275
No. unfortunately it's not.

1573
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:46.896
You see. the trustees
are not going to like it.

1574
01:17:46.931 --> 01:17:48.758
and they're going
to want someone

1575
01:17:48.793 --> 01:17:51.137
to be made accountable for it.

1576
01:17:51.172 --> 01:17:55.241
And unfortunately.
that's going to be you.

1577
01:17:55.275 --> 01:17:59.724
But I might be able
to help. I don't know.

1578
01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:01.103
How?

1579
01:18:01.137 --> 01:18:04.137
Well. what if I told
you that I could prevent

1580
01:18:04.172 --> 01:18:05.896
you from being expelled?

1581
01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:06.896
Could you?

1582
01:18:06.931 --> 01:18:08.000
And get a full scholarship?

1583
01:18:08.034 --> 01:18:09.206
Could you?

1584
01:18:09.241 --> 01:18:12.344
Ah. a secret full scholarship.

1585
01:18:12.379 --> 01:18:12.931
Could you?

1586
01:18:12.965 --> 01:18:14.965
Of course I can. Mitch.

1587
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.827
You know. when they told me
what was going to happen to you

1588
01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:23.379
tomorrow I thought to
myself. oh my goodness.

1589
01:18:23.413 --> 01:18:27.172
I can't let my best
student liaison

1590
01:18:27.206 --> 01:18:31.241
get tossed out like garbage.

1591
01:18:31.275 --> 01:18:35.000
In fact. there's this.

1592
01:18:37.448 --> 01:18:39.206
Oh. is that?

1593
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:47.206
Yes. the student
headmaster pin.

1594
01:18:47.241 --> 01:18:50.793
You just about earned it.

1595
01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:51.448
It is real.

1596
01:18:51.482 --> 01:18:53.931
Thank you.

1597
01:18:53.965 --> 01:18:56.896
Oh. put me down.

1598
01:18:56.931 --> 01:19:04.482
I-- I just need you to
do one more thing for me.

1599
01:19:04.517 --> 01:19:06.482
Oh?

1600
01:19:06.517 --> 01:19:08.931
OK. anything.

1601
01:19:16.482 --> 01:19:19.931
Now. listen. I'm asking for
everyone's prayers tonight

1602
01:19:19.965 --> 01:19:26.206
for Vicky and Ty as they
perform God's music at the Music

1603
01:19:26.241 --> 01:19:29.379
Fest. the Prestige.

1604
01:19:35.275 --> 01:19:38.068
They're going to be singing
in front of their peers.

1605
01:19:38.103 --> 01:19:42.068
and tonight Lord. we pray that
you give them the strength

1606
01:19:42.103 --> 01:19:44.965
and the determination
they need. Lord.

1607
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.896
to sing to your expectations
and not to man's.

1608
01:19:48.931 --> 01:19:50.103
Amen. amen.

1609
01:19:50.137 --> 01:19:53.482
And the people said Amen.

1610
01:19:53.517 --> 01:19:56.068
Hallelujah.

1611
01:19:56.103 --> 01:19:58.310
Come on. Vicky.

1612
01:19:58.344 --> 01:20:00.620
I would like to
thank all of you

1613
01:20:00.655 --> 01:20:03.275
for the prayers and
the support as I go

1614
01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:06.241
Prestige to bear God's message.

1615
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:12.172
VICKY
Ty is a youth pastor

1616
01:20:12.206 --> 01:20:13.482
and Junior seems
to be buying it.

1617
01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:15.206
so I have to play up
the Christian angle

1618
01:20:15.241 --> 01:20:16.000
to keep them on board.

1619
01:20:17.586 --> 01:20:21.862
but people
that buy Christian stuff.

1620
01:20:21.896 --> 01:20:23.034
this music gets them--

1621
01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:24.034
Junior!

1622
01:20:24.068 --> 01:20:26.379
Junior?

1623
01:20:26.413 --> 01:20:27.034
Junior!

1624
01:20:27.068 --> 01:20:29.344
Junior!

1625
01:20:29.379 --> 01:20:31.000
Junior!

1626
01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:34.241
Vicky. Vicky.

1627
01:20:34.275 --> 01:20:36.551
Did you know about this?

1628
01:20:36.586 --> 01:20:38.379
I didn't know anything.

1629
01:20:38.413 --> 01:20:40.034
Let her go.

1630
01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:41.172
She's got my car.

1631
01:21:12.517 --> 01:21:13.310
Junior!

1632
01:21:13.344 --> 01:21:14.172
Junior!

1633
01:21:23.482 --> 01:21:26.931
Mitch. come here. come here.

1634
01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:30.344
Smile. Mitch. smile.

1635
01:21:30.379 --> 01:21:33.586
Listen. if everything
went as planned.

1636
01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:37.172
you my friend are going to
have a very bright future here.

1637
01:21:39.482 --> 01:21:42.137
He didn't even go
to school here.

1638
01:21:42.172 --> 01:21:44.379
Forget about him.

1639
01:21:44.413 --> 01:21:47.413
Oh. come on. it's time.

1640
01:21:52.413 --> 01:21:54.172
Junior. I really
didn't mean it.

1641
01:21:54.206 --> 01:21:56.034
Oh. so that was
your twin on the tape.

1642
01:21:56.068 --> 01:21:58.413
Look. don't stand here and
tell me you didn't mean it.

1643
01:21:58.448 --> 01:22:00.206
Don't be a manipulator
and a liar.

1644
01:22:00.241 --> 01:22:01.724
OK. I did mean it.

1645
01:22:01.758 --> 01:22:03.034
But remember. you
the one that came

1646
01:22:03.068 --> 01:22:04.517
up with the transition thing.

1647
01:22:04.551 --> 01:22:06.137
Oh. so now you want to
deflate your responsibilities

1648
01:22:06.172 --> 01:22:07.482
and cover up what you said.

1649
01:22:07.517 --> 01:22:09.068
Please. V.

1650
01:22:09.103 --> 01:22:10.689
You see. at first it
was all about standing out

1651
01:22:10.724 --> 01:22:12.206
at Music Fest.

1652
01:22:12.241 --> 01:22:14.068
But the more we rehearsed.
I saw the effect

1653
01:22:14.103 --> 01:22:18.379
the lyrics had on you. my
family. the congregation.

1654
01:22:18.413 --> 01:22:19.517
It started to make sense.

1655
01:22:19.551 --> 01:22:21.310
You were cute when
I first met you.

1656
01:22:21.344 --> 01:22:24.068
you were irresistible.
in awe. like even

1657
01:22:24.103 --> 01:22:26.137
when it seemed like you
believed in something bigger

1658
01:22:26.172 --> 01:22:28.413
than yourself.

1659
01:22:28.448 --> 01:22:31.034
Please. don't do this to me too.

1660
01:22:31.068 --> 01:22:33.379
You know what I learned
my first day at Prestige?

1661
01:22:37.275 --> 01:22:38.620
Believe in yourself.

1662
01:22:49.655 --> 01:22:51.034
I've lost her.

1663
01:22:51.068 --> 01:22:51.724
Oh. no.

1664
01:22:51.758 --> 01:22:53.379
She's empty inside.

1665
01:22:53.413 --> 01:22:56.310
No. Gwen. I think
it's just the opposite.

1666
01:22:56.344 --> 01:22:57.655
I think she's finding herself.

1667
01:22:57.689 --> 01:22:59.620
She's got so many
feelings inside she

1668
01:22:59.655 --> 01:23:02.413
doesn't know which
one to choose.

1669
01:23:02.448 --> 01:23:06.034
I just don't understand
what she was trying to do.

1670
01:23:06.068 --> 01:23:08.068
If Robert was here.
he'd know what to do.

1671
01:23:08.103 --> 01:23:09.448
I raised Robert.

1672
01:23:09.482 --> 01:23:11.586
I knew exactly what he would do.

1673
01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:15.482
He would say the only way
to get through this mess is

1674
01:23:15.517 --> 01:23:18.206
right through the heart of it.

1675
01:23:18.241 --> 01:23:21.206
Vicky needs to hear that.

1676
01:23:21.241 --> 01:23:24.206
Oh. baby. Vicky already knows.

1677
01:23:24.241 --> 01:23:27.034
Challenge.
try not to move.

1678
01:23:27.068 --> 01:23:28.551
I can't help myself.

1679
01:23:28.586 --> 01:23:30.206
This your song. but
try not to move.

1680
01:23:30.241 --> 01:23:31.724
I can't help myself.

1681
01:23:31.758 --> 01:23:36.758
Mitch. you got to
be here somewhere.

1682
01:23:40.241 --> 01:23:43.034
I can't believe this man
ratted me out like that. bro.

1683
01:23:43.068 --> 01:23:46.137
Damn.

1684
01:23:46.172 --> 01:23:49.206
You heard the rhythms.
I know that you feel this.

1685
01:23:49.241 --> 01:23:54.586
So get this. so hit your DJ
and tell him to spin this.

1686
01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:58.034
Got your jam try not to move.

1687
01:23:58.068 --> 01:24:02.827
It's your song. but
try not to groove.

1688
01:24:02.862 --> 01:24:06.862
Do your dance. but
there's no moves.

1689
01:24:06.896 --> 01:24:14.379
Help out the girl like oo.
hope to get the girl like ah.

1690
01:24:14.413 --> 01:24:17.758
I can't help myself.

1691
01:24:17.793 --> 01:24:21.103
God is good.

1692
01:24:21.137 --> 01:24:22.655
You know. Ty. you're
supposed to channel

1693
01:24:22.689 --> 01:24:26.206
that energy during the service.

1694
01:24:26.241 --> 01:24:28.103
That kid used me.

1695
01:24:28.137 --> 01:24:30.620
She used all of us.

1696
01:24:30.655 --> 01:24:32.241
Is that it?

1697
01:24:32.275 --> 01:24:34.793
That's it.

1698
01:24:34.827 --> 01:24:36.793
As a youth pastor.
you're supposed to learn

1699
01:24:36.827 --> 01:24:38.620
something new every day.

1700
01:24:38.655 --> 01:24:40.482
I wonder. what have
you learned today?

1701
01:24:42.827 --> 01:24:45.517
Because of the giving
nature of what we do.

1702
01:24:45.551 --> 01:24:46.758
people will always
take advantage.

1703
01:24:46.793 --> 01:24:50.827
Well. that's the
risk we take some time.

1704
01:24:50.862 --> 01:24:53.275
At least I know
how to spot a phony.

1705
01:24:56.931 --> 01:25:00.724
You know. Ty. it's easier
to lead people who are already

1706
01:25:00.758 --> 01:25:02.517
walking in the right direction.

1707
01:25:06.793 --> 01:25:07.896
Mitch!

1708
01:25:07.931 --> 01:25:13.172
Mitch. I know you
in here somewhere.

1709
01:25:13.206 --> 01:25:16.172
Mitch. where are you hiding?

1710
01:25:16.206 --> 01:25:17.724
I should have know when
Junior told me you was

1711
01:25:17.758 --> 01:25:19.448
a snitch you'd stoop this low.

1712
01:25:19.482 --> 01:25:22.344
OK. OK. don't hit me.

1713
01:25:22.379 --> 01:25:23.827
Mitch. are you serious?

1714
01:25:23.862 --> 01:25:24.655
Why did you do it?

1715
01:25:24.689 --> 01:25:25.827
For a pin?

1716
01:25:25.862 --> 01:25:30.517
It's all I wanted
since I got here.

1717
01:25:30.551 --> 01:25:31.862
Bro. we had
already accepted you.

1718
01:25:31.896 --> 01:25:33.551
That's the only reason
why you wanted it.

1719
01:25:33.586 --> 01:25:34.724
- You were using me.
- Mitch.

1720
01:25:34.758 --> 01:25:36.517
I was never too
stupid to know that.

1721
01:25:36.551 --> 01:25:38.517
At the beginning.
I kind of was.

1722
01:25:38.551 --> 01:25:40.206
But somewhere along the
way. I thought we became

1723
01:25:40.241 --> 01:25:42.827
friends. like real friends.

1724
01:25:42.862 --> 01:25:43.482
Real?

1725
01:25:43.517 --> 01:25:45.275
Yes. for real.

1726
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:45.931
You mean that?

1727
01:25:45.965 --> 01:25:48.862
I mean that.

1728
01:25:48.896 --> 01:25:53.275
I'm sorry Vicky. but
I'm a student at Prestige

1729
01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:55.448
and I don't want to lose that.

1730
01:25:55.482 --> 01:25:56.758
I'm all alone here.

1731
01:25:56.793 --> 01:25:59.793
No family. no friends. just me.

1732
01:26:06.862 --> 01:26:08.689
What's this?

1733
01:26:08.724 --> 01:26:11.379
You'll need it to perform.

1734
01:26:11.413 --> 01:26:12.448
Look.

1735
01:26:15.448 --> 01:26:18.655
What's this?

1736
01:26:18.689 --> 01:26:20.310
OK. so you made up for it?

1737
01:26:20.344 --> 01:26:21.413
Yeah.

1738
01:26:21.448 --> 01:26:22.379
That's dope. Mitch. OK.

1739
01:26:22.413 --> 01:26:23.413
Yeah.

1740
01:26:23.448 --> 01:26:25.000
Listen. where's Ty?

1741
01:26:25.034 --> 01:26:29.344
I left him a message.
but he never responded.

1742
01:26:29.379 --> 01:26:30.758
OK. OK. OK.

1743
01:26:30.793 --> 01:26:32.241
We're going to meet back here.

1744
01:26:32.275 --> 01:26:34.793
I'm gonna go put this on.

1745
01:26:34.827 --> 01:26:40.000
And now. for my pride and
joy. Alpha Beta Sigma. whoop!

1746
01:26:43.275 --> 01:26:46.241
I don't
quite like where I am.

1747
01:26:46.275 --> 01:26:49.620
There has to be a
place where I can go

1748
01:26:49.655 --> 01:26:52.413
and no one knows
my name. and I can

1749
01:26:52.448 --> 01:26:58.655
spend some time alone with you
and only you is what I need.

1750
01:26:58.689 --> 01:27:01.827
Because I feel free
enough to say these things

1751
01:27:01.862 --> 01:27:05.000
that while you are my sanity.

1752
01:27:05.034 --> 01:27:11.896
Up inside the towers of
my mind. you live sublime.

1753
01:27:11.931 --> 01:27:15.068
and no one but me
knows that you exist.

1754
01:27:15.103 --> 01:27:22.896
It's not really easy for me
to hide a light so bright.

1755
01:27:22.931 --> 01:27:24.000
and there's only one
way to describe you.

1756
01:27:24.034 --> 01:27:25.551
Hey. let me grab
my bag real quick

1757
01:27:25.586 --> 01:27:26.344
and we'll get out of here.

1758
01:27:26.379 --> 01:27:28.344
OK.

1759
01:27:28.379 --> 01:27:29.000
Mitch.

1760
01:27:29.034 --> 01:27:32.310
Wait. shh. shh.

1761
01:27:32.344 --> 01:27:34.413
Mitch.

1762
01:27:34.448 --> 01:27:35.000
Go. go.

1763
01:27:39.034 --> 01:27:44.896
Mitch. Mitch. I know that
Water's kid is hiding in here.

1764
01:27:44.931 --> 01:27:47.586
Chancellor Davis saw her go in.

1765
01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:48.965
I just need to remove
her. that's all.

1766
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.827
You. go behind me.
go. go. go. go. go.

1767
01:27:50.862 --> 01:27:53.000
This can be done
real easy. man.

1768
01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:55.517
There's only one way
in and one way out.

1769
01:27:55.551 --> 01:27:56.827
Go. Vicky. go. go.

1770
01:27:56.862 --> 01:27:59.482
Vicky. use that Music Fest go.

1771
01:27:59.517 --> 01:28:01.034
Get back here Waters.

1772
01:28:01.068 --> 01:28:04.379
And that concludes
our final music act.

1773
01:28:07.068 --> 01:28:09.379
Oh. good heavens.

1774
01:28:09.413 --> 01:28:10.379
Security.

1775
01:28:10.413 --> 01:28:11.793
Women should be able to sing.

1776
01:28:11.827 --> 01:28:14.586
Get this kid off the
stage. and off this campus

1777
01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:15.655
immediately.

1778
01:28:15.689 --> 01:28:17.034
Let me sing.

1779
01:28:17.068 --> 01:28:20.551
Women should be able to
sing in this competition.

1780
01:28:20.586 --> 01:28:21.758
Give me a chance.

1781
01:28:21.793 --> 01:28:23.413
I hope you had fun.

1782
01:28:23.448 --> 01:28:24.620
The judges will now tally the--

1783
01:28:24.655 --> 01:28:25.551
Let her sing!

1784
01:28:25.586 --> 01:28:26.689
Let her sing!

1785
01:28:26.724 --> 01:28:28.379
Let her sing!

1786
01:28:28.413 --> 01:28:29.517
Let her sing!

1787
01:28:29.551 --> 01:28:30.517
Let her sing!

1788
01:28:30.551 --> 01:28:31.586
Let her sing!

1789
01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.379
Let her sing!

1790
01:28:33.413 --> 01:28:34.517
Let her sing!

1791
01:28:34.551 --> 01:28:37.034
Let her sing!

1792
01:28:37.068 --> 01:28:38.758
Ladies and
gentlemen. the last act

1793
01:28:38.793 --> 01:28:41.862
of the evening. Alpha Chiro.

1794
01:28:47.758 --> 01:28:49.724
Your teaching days are over.

1795
01:28:59.413 --> 01:29:02.793
Mr. Moore. true musicians
support your music.

1796
01:29:08.103 --> 01:29:11.965
When I first chose
this song. I didn't

1797
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.103
give the message much thought.

1798
01:29:13.137 --> 01:29:17.965
But I get it now.

1799
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.620
There's something else
I would like to say.

1800
01:29:21.655 --> 01:29:23.482
When I learned that the
school was only allowing men

1801
01:29:23.517 --> 01:29:28.862
to compete. I decided
to cheat. say I was

1802
01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:31.965
in transition. one of the boys.

1803
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.103
It wasn't right.
nor was it fair.

1804
01:29:35.137 --> 01:29:38.689
But I strongly believe
every person. man or woman.

1805
01:29:38.724 --> 01:29:41.000
should be able to perform.

1806
01:29:41.034 --> 01:29:42.103
Laws are meant to be changed.

1807
01:29:45.586 --> 01:29:50.000
Wait. wait. wait. listen.
um. I did everything

1808
01:29:50.034 --> 01:29:52.724
in my power to stop
her from being on stage

1809
01:29:52.758 --> 01:29:54.965
and singing the song.

1810
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.172
And I was against this
from the beginning.

1811
01:29:58.206 --> 01:30:03.034
and consequences will
be had. I assure you.

1812
01:30:03.068 --> 01:30:08.000
I had nothing to do with
this. and I'm very sorry.

1813
01:30:08.034 --> 01:30:11.793
She or he changed the rules.

1814
01:30:11.827 --> 01:30:14.448
You were going to stop this?

1815
01:30:14.482 --> 01:30:15.517
Well. but--

1816
01:30:15.551 --> 01:30:17.000
Mandatory board
meeting tomorrow

1817
01:30:17.034 --> 01:30:20.724
morning. the bylaws
will be changed.

1818
01:30:20.758 --> 01:30:24.172
The board of trustees would like
to know more about the details

1819
01:30:24.206 --> 01:30:25.103
of your efforts.

1820
01:30:25.137 --> 01:30:26.000
Don't. don't--

1821
01:30:31.689 --> 01:30:33.689
VICKY After losing
someone that meant everything

1822
01:30:33.724 --> 01:30:37.517
to me. I was truly lost.

1823
01:30:37.551 --> 01:30:40.103
Thanks to some really
special people that helped

1824
01:30:40.137 --> 01:30:42.724
guide me back to
being my true self.

1825
01:30:42.758 --> 01:30:44.724
I believe
that it's my season.

1826
01:30:44.758 --> 01:30:46.206
JUNIOR
It didn't hurt

1827
01:30:46.241 --> 01:30:48.931
that I was able to stay on.
despite my hand in trying

1828
01:30:48.965 --> 01:30:51.137
to stick it to Chancellor Davis.

1829
01:30:51.172 --> 01:30:53.000
I've never been so
grateful for the people

1830
01:30:53.034 --> 01:30:56.620
that I've met that
challenged me. even

1831
01:30:56.655 --> 01:30:58.034
the possible future in-laws.

1832
01:30:58.068 --> 01:31:01.551
It's my time.
and I can feel it.

1833
01:31:01.586 --> 01:31:04.724
VICKY Mom
finally listened to grandma.

1834
01:31:04.758 --> 01:31:08.931
Fighting for the insurance money
gave her the spirit to move on.

1835
01:31:08.965 --> 01:31:13.068
but she'll always miss my dad.

1836
01:31:13.103 --> 01:31:15.241
Even though I wasn't
able to perform.

1837
01:31:15.275 --> 01:31:17.137
they did give me a
partial scholarship

1838
01:31:17.172 --> 01:31:19.000
for bringing awareness
of outdated rules

1839
01:31:19.034 --> 01:31:22.068
that needed to be changed.

1840
01:31:22.103 --> 01:31:24.068
The board even brought
us a new chancellor.

1841
01:31:27.586 --> 01:31:29.137
All of us women looking
to change the narrative

1842
01:31:29.172 --> 01:31:31.551
have to keep pushing
and not let up.

1843
01:31:31.586 --> 01:31:33.896
And it's gonna be big.

1844
01:31:33.931 --> 01:31:35.586
VICKY God
will always be the guiding

1845
01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:39.689
light through all of us.

1846
01:31:40.724 --> 01:31:43.862
And it s gonna be big.

1847
01:31:51.689 --> 01:31:56.793
God's gonna open the windows of
heaven. pour me out a blessing.

1848
01:31:56.827 --> 01:31:59.931
won't be wrong to
contain it. won't

1849
01:31:59.965 --> 01:32:00.931
even trying to explain it.

1850
01:32:00.965 --> 01:32:05.586
But it's gonna be big.

1851
01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:08.000
Riding shotgun when I'm
turbo. buddy

1852
01:32:08.034 --> 01:32:09.758
make whole world know.

1853
01:32:09.793 --> 01:32:12.793
Why are you trying to make
Stephen Erkle. you can't stay

1854
01:32:12.827 --> 01:32:14.241
still you got to work though.

1855
01:32:14.275 --> 01:32:16.931
All around the world like
Where's Waldo. in the club

1856
01:32:16.965 --> 01:32:19.068
but he ain't on the wall
though. he's in the hood

1857
01:32:19.103 --> 01:32:21.931
asking where the child goes.

1858
01:32:21.965 --> 01:32:32.172
I know you only see
me in my victory.

1859
01:32:32.206 --> 01:32:37.758
But when defeat took
the words from me.

1860
01:32:37.793 --> 01:32:41.965
the Lord spoke out for me.

1861
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:54.241
And I made it
through. yes. me too.

1862
01:32:54.275 --> 01:32:59.689
If it ever came down to
just me and God. it's OK.

1863
01:32:59.724 --> 01:33:00.206
OK.

1864
01:33:03.896 --> 01:33:04.965
Yo. you good?

1865
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.793
I'm all good.

1866
01:33:06.827 --> 01:33:08.827
You don't sound like it.
your mom told me to call you.

1867
01:33:08.862 --> 01:33:11.172
I'm just checking on you.

1868
01:33:11.206 --> 01:33:13.689
Oh. I know you're going
through some stuff.

1869
01:33:13.724 --> 01:33:15.931
but it's going to be all
right. shorty. you know.

1870
01:33:15.965 --> 01:33:19.827
Hey. keep your
head up. you know.

1871
01:33:19.862 --> 01:33:22.000
Ooh. I'm gonna be OK.

1872
01:33:24.413 --> 01:33:27.724
And no one but me
knows that you exist.

1873
01:33:27.758 --> 01:33:35.655
It's not very easy for me
to hide a light so bright.

1874
01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:39.931
and there's only one
word to describe you.

1875
01:33:39.965 --> 01:33:46.000
Special. special.
ooh. special you are.

1876
01:33:48.758 --> 01:33:54.241
No. my prayers aren't yours.

1877
01:33:54.275 --> 01:33:57.689
We come from the block
where we dodge cars

1878
01:33:57.724 --> 01:34:01.379
and pray through open doors.

1879
01:34:01.413 --> 01:34:04.758
Tell me if there's room
for Jesus in the ghetto.

1880
01:34:04.793 --> 01:34:08.241
Tell me if there's room
for Jesus in the ghetto.

1881
01:34:08.275 --> 01:34:11.448
Tell me if there's
room in the ghetto.

1882
01:34:11.482 --> 01:34:15.724
tell me if there's
room in the ghetto.

1883
01:34:15.758 --> 01:34:26.241
Run for their lives.
but the battle I fought.

1884
01:34:26.275 --> 01:34:30.931
I fought it well. I stood tall.

1885
01:34:33.344 --> 01:34:43.068
And one day. well. you're
going to have to fight well.

1886
01:34:43.103 --> 01:34:45.034
You ought to stand tall.

1887
01:34:45.068 --> 01:34:48.827
Sing it with me. y'all.

1888
01:34:48.862 --> 01:34:54.413
I'm a gangster. ain't no way
that you can take my energy.

1889
01:34:54.448 --> 01:34:58.241
Haters trying to trap
me but I'm flying free.

1890
01:34:58.275 --> 01:35:02.448
Now I'm flossing in
front of my enemy.
