- Thomas?
- Yes?

10
00:00:52.617 --> 00:00:54.141
This is Star.

11
00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:56.360
Star's gonna be staying
with us for a few days.

12
00:00:57.622 --> 00:00:59.624
Oh. no. don't worry.
I don't mind you.

13
00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:00.799
Come in.

14
00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:05.500
She says
she's an atheist.

15
00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:09.069
Only God's an atheist.

16
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:18.556
<i>And when sin and seduction
are set free...</i>

17
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.689
Get off!

18
00:01:20.863 --> 00:01:24.475
Get... away! Evil woman!

19
00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:25.781
I know this game.

20
00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:27.348
She's a nymphomaniac.

21
00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:30.177
That's just another way
she's unfortunate.

22
00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:39.882
It was the filthy. dirty.
criminal slut who stole my gun.

23
00:01:40.056 --> 00:01:43.451
- Oh. Thomas don't you--
- You believe me. don't you. Mom?

24
00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:45.235
You believe me Shut up!

25
00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.194

FLANNERY [Narrating]:
<i>The sky was underpinned</i>

30
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.723
<i>with long silver streaks
that looked like scaffolding.</i>

31
00:02:40.464 --> 00:02:43.075
<i>And behind it
were thousands of stars</i>

32
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.339
<i>still moving slowly.</i>

33
00:02:45.513 --> 00:02:48.037
<i>as if they were about
some vast construction work</i>

34
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:51.475
<i>that involved the whole order
of the universe</i>

35
00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:54.783
<i>and would take all of time
to complete.</i>

36
00:02:56.828 --> 00:02:59.527
<i>But no one was paying
any attention to the sky.</i>

37
00:03:38.392 --> 00:03:39.349
Damn.

38
00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:18.170
The world was made
for the dead.

39
00:04:33.577 --> 00:04:37.277
Think of all
the dead that are there.

40
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:40.149
so many more dead
than there are living.

41
00:04:40.323 --> 00:04:43.326
And the dead are dead
much longer than the living

42
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.110
are alive.

43
00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:49.680
And they don't seem to mind.

44
00:06:08.106 --> 00:06:09.543
<i>Dear God.</i>

45
00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:12.807
<i>I am so discouraged
about my work.</i>

46
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:15.026
<i>I want to write a novel.</i>

47
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:18.378
<i>A good novel.</i>

48
00:06:18.552 --> 00:06:20.510
<i>I want to do this
for a good feeling</i>

49
00:06:20.684 --> 00:06:22.599
<i>and for a bad one.</i>

50
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.386
<i>The bad one is uppermost.</i>

51
00:06:30.433 --> 00:06:32.957
<i>Please. help me get down
under things. where you are.</i>

WOMAN [Whispering]:
Obadiah Elihue.

53
00:06:41.966 --> 00:06:45.100
Obadiah. Obadiah.
Obadiah Elihue.

54
00:06:45.274 --> 00:06:47.145
Obadiah Elihue.

55
00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.452
What. Obadiah Elihue?

56
00:06:50.584 --> 00:06:51.715
Obadiah Elihue.

57
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.109
O-- Obadiah Elihue.

58
00:06:54.283 --> 00:06:56.198
What does that name mean?

59
00:06:56.372 --> 00:06:58.200
Servant of God.

60
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.336
Miss O'Connor. I...

61
00:07:04.511 --> 00:07:06.295
I respect you.
so I'm gonna be honest.

62
00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.776
Sometimes. I feel like

63
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.255
you're trying to stick pins
in your readers.

64
00:07:11.605 --> 00:07:13.302
I don't think you need to
make them suffer

65
00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:16.261
in order to introduce them to
the unusual way your mind works.

66
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.089
It feels a little like

67
00:07:18.263 --> 00:07:20.657
you're trying to pick a fight
with your reader.

68
00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:23.486
when all they ever did was open
the front cover of your book.

69
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:28.360
I'm also not sure

70
00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:31.538
if all the rewriting
that you're doing is helping.

71
00:07:33.104 --> 00:07:34.845
I mean. I only say that

72
00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:37.848
because the book. as it was
on the whole. is very strong.

73
00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:42.766
I'm wondering if you want to
get into some specifics.

74
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.507
I'm amenable to criticism.

75
00:07:46.988 --> 00:07:48.076
Okay.

76
00:07:49.817 --> 00:07:51.906
Well. these are just

77
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.777
some of our initial thoughts
and reservations

78
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:55.387
about your book so far.

79
00:07:55.562 --> 00:07:57.520
You can take it home
with you.

80
00:07:57.694 --> 00:08:01.785
I do think... an outline
would be useful at this point.

81
00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.744
just to give us a sense of

82
00:08:03.918 --> 00:08:06.050
what the final chapters
will look like.

83
00:08:09.793 --> 00:08:11.403
I'm amenable to criticism.

84
00:08:11.578 --> 00:08:13.797
but only within the sphere
of what I'm trying to do.

85
00:08:24.982 --> 00:08:26.462
All right.
the real question is.

86
00:08:26.636 --> 00:08:28.420
do you want me to be specific
and work with you

87
00:08:28.595 --> 00:08:30.814
the way that I work with
all the writers on the payroll.

88
00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:33.425
or do you prefer
to go it alone?

89
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.124
Think about it.

90
00:08:36.298 --> 00:08:39.301
Take some time. and
I'll follow up with Miss McKee.

91
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:43.174
Um...

92
00:08:43.348 --> 00:08:47.091
it was really. really nice
to meet you in person.

93
00:08:47.265 --> 00:08:48.702
Miss O'Connor.

94
00:08:48.876 --> 00:08:50.486
- Uh--
- Safe travels.

95
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.619
- Thank you.
- Take care.

96
00:09:07.808 --> 00:09:10.462
Oh. you're back.

97
00:09:10.637 --> 00:09:12.900
Before I go.

98
00:09:13.074 --> 00:09:15.511
I think my position
on the novel

99
00:09:15.685 --> 00:09:18.558
and on your criticism
should be made plain.

100
00:09:20.037 --> 00:09:22.300
I don't outline.

101
00:09:22.474 --> 00:09:24.912
I-- I have to write
to discover what I'm doing.

102
00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:28.089
and I don't know so well
what I think

103
00:09:28.263 --> 00:09:30.352
until I see what I say.

104
00:09:30.526 --> 00:09:33.137
Then I have to say it
over again.

105
00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:36.401
I feel that whatever virtues
the novel may have

106
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:40.362
are very much connected with
the limitations you mentioned.

107
00:09:40.536 --> 00:09:42.625
To develop at all
as a writer.

108
00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:45.585
I-- I think I have to develop
in my own way.

109
00:09:46.977 --> 00:09:48.675
I will not be persuaded
to do otherwise.

110
00:09:49.937 --> 00:09:51.678
The objections you raised
suggest that

111
00:09:51.852 --> 00:09:53.331
you would like to rescue
the book at this point.

112
00:09:53.505 --> 00:09:55.116
and train it into
a conventional novel.

113
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.248
But I'm not writing
a conventional novel.

114
00:09:57.422 --> 00:09:59.381
Wise Blood.
when finished.

115
00:09:59.555 --> 00:10:02.036
will be hopefully less angular.
but just as odd. if not odder.

116
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.255
than the nine chapters
you have now.

117
00:10:05.692 --> 00:10:08.564
So. the question is...

118
00:10:08.738 --> 00:10:11.306
Is Rinehart interested
in publishing

119
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.917
a new kind of novel?

120
00:10:16.572 --> 00:10:18.313
He says to me.

121
00:10:18.487 --> 00:10:20.141
"Miss O'Connor. you seem like
a straight shooter.

122
00:10:20.315 --> 00:10:22.056
"but I'm disturbed by
the hardening of the arteries

123
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.797
"of your cooperative sense.

124
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:26.626
"It is most unbecoming
in a woman writer so young."

125
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.279
- A straight shooter?
- Yes.

126
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.587
You know. I think I'd rather
throw myself

127
00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:33.067
in front of the Dixie Limited
than write an outline.

128
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:34.808
I know.

129
00:10:34.982 --> 00:10:36.548
If they don't think I'm worth
giving more money to

130
00:10:36.723 --> 00:10:38.507
and just leaving alone.
then they should let me go.

131
00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:40.117
He is an idiot.

132
00:10:41.423 --> 00:10:42.685
I don't know.

133
00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:45.470
He and I came up with
the expression

134
00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.125
that I was
"prematurely arrogant."

135
00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:49.953
I had to supply him with
the phrase.

136
00:10:50.127 --> 00:10:51.868
Of course.
That's good.

137
00:10:53.217 --> 00:10:55.002
It's edit-proof.

138
00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:57.265
If he has any sense.
he'll publish it.

139
00:10:57.439 --> 00:10:58.701
Thanks. Cal.

140
00:11:01.356 --> 00:11:04.446
I try to turn the other cheek.
but my tongue is always in it.

141
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.448
I do need
that advance. though.

142
00:11:06.622 --> 00:11:08.102
I need cigarettes.

143
00:11:08.276 --> 00:11:10.060
Oh. all right.

144
00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:14.543
Will you get me
a New York Times. please?

145
00:11:14.717 --> 00:11:16.240
Two of 'em.

146
00:11:16.414 --> 00:11:17.981
Two?
- Two.

147
00:11:32.735 --> 00:11:35.869
FLANNERY [Narrating]:
<i>The tramp swung both his whole</i>

148
00:11:36.043 --> 00:11:39.133
<i>and his short arm up slowly</i>

149
00:11:39.307 --> 00:11:42.005
<i>so that they indicated
an expanse of sky.</i>

150
00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:43.659
<i>and his figure formed
a crooked cross.</i>

151
00:11:52.755 --> 00:11:55.018
<i>Although the old woman
lived in this desolate spot</i>

152
00:11:55.192 --> 00:11:56.803
<i>with only her daughter. Lucynell.</i>

153
00:11:56.977 --> 00:11:58.718
<i>and had never seen
the one-armed man before.</i>

154
00:11:58.892 --> 00:12:00.589
<i>she could tell.
even from a distance.</i>

155
00:12:00.763 --> 00:12:04.419
<i>he was a tramp
and no one to be afraid of.</i>

156
00:12:04.593 --> 00:12:07.509
I'd pay a fortune

157
00:12:07.683 --> 00:12:10.512
to live in a spot
as pretty as this one.

158
00:12:10.686 --> 00:12:13.036
I'll bet that sunset...

159
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.603
is something to see.

160
00:12:15.909 --> 00:12:18.694
Happens every evening.

161
00:12:18.868 --> 00:12:19.826
Yeah.

162
00:12:21.088 --> 00:12:22.132
Well...

163
00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:25.266
You ladies drive?

164
00:12:27.964 --> 00:12:31.402
Oh. that car ain't run
in years.

165
00:12:32.447 --> 00:12:35.580
Well. nothing's like
it used to be.

166
00:12:38.148 --> 00:12:40.107
World is almost rotten.

167
00:12:42.413 --> 00:12:44.546
Where are you from. mister?

168
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.505
Well...

169
00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:49.072
Well. I could tell
you anything.

170
00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:51.292
I could tell you that
I'm Tom T. Shiftlet

171
00:12:51.466 --> 00:12:53.120
from Tarwater. Tennessee.

172
00:12:53.294 --> 00:12:54.991
but how would you know
I ain't lying. hmm?

173
00:12:55.165 --> 00:12:56.601
I could be Aaron Sparks

174
00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.952
from... Singleton. Georgia.

175
00:12:59.126 --> 00:13:00.562
You don't know.

176
00:13:01.911 --> 00:13:04.305
I don't know
nothing about you.

177
00:13:07.656 --> 00:13:10.093
Maybe... the best
I can tell you

178
00:13:10.267 --> 00:13:12.400
is that I'm a man.

179
00:13:12.574 --> 00:13:15.664
Well. not a whole man. but...

180
00:13:17.492 --> 00:13:19.842
...but what is a man.
you know?

181
00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:26.588
Well. you could hang
around here.

182
00:13:26.762 --> 00:13:28.372
work.

183
00:13:28.546 --> 00:13:29.939
I'll pay you in food.

184
00:13:30.113 --> 00:13:31.549
you don't mind sleeping
in the car yonder.

185
00:13:33.377 --> 00:13:35.989
The monks of old
slept in their coffins.

186
00:13:37.251 --> 00:13:39.557
They wasn't as advanced
as we are.

187
00:13:44.214 --> 00:13:45.520
Yeah.

188
00:13:51.091 --> 00:13:52.570
Oh. hey.
I-- I have something for you.

189
00:13:52.744 --> 00:13:54.268
- Oh?
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:13:54.442 --> 00:13:55.399
Here it is.

191
00:13:55.573 --> 00:13:57.010
What is this?

192
00:13:57.184 --> 00:13:59.708
This is courtesy of Bob Giroux
at Harcourt.

193
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.885
I showed him your story
in the Partisan Review.

194
00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:04.713
His exact quote was.

195
00:14:04.887 --> 00:14:07.411
"That young Catholic writer
is an astonishing talent."

196
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.067
He wants to meet you.

197
00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:15.811
- Thanks. Cal.
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:17.813
Hey. we can go together.

199
00:14:17.987 --> 00:14:19.380
You-- you're back next week?

200
00:14:19.554 --> 00:14:21.034
I'll be back.
if it wasn't for my mother.

201
00:14:21.208 --> 00:14:22.949
I'd never see Georgia
ever again.

202
00:14:23.123 --> 00:14:24.689
<i>Now boarding on Track 7.</i>

203
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.604
<i>Crescent Line to New Orleans.
now boarding.</i>

204
00:14:26.778 --> 00:14:28.737
Oh.

205
00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:30.782
I should come down
and visit it sometime.

206
00:14:30.957 --> 00:14:32.828
You would return
with the curled hair.

207
00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:47.495
- Cal.
- Oh.

208
00:14:48.539 --> 00:14:50.237
You are an angel.

209
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.109
I don't want to be an angel...

210
00:14:55.024 --> 00:14:57.461
...though my relations with them
have improved over time.

211
00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.290
You speak with them?

212
00:15:00.464 --> 00:15:02.336
When I was in Catholic school.

213
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.078
I had what the Freudians would
call anti-angel aggression.

214
00:15:05.252 --> 00:15:07.994
I would seclude myself
in a locked room every so often.

215
00:15:08.168 --> 00:15:10.910
and ball up my fist.
and whirl around in circles

216
00:15:11.084 --> 00:15:12.476
knocking out
my guardian angel.

217
00:15:13.869 --> 00:15:15.349
At least trying to dirty up
his feathers a little.

218
00:15:15.523 --> 00:15:16.872
Well. haven't they suffered
enough?

219
00:15:17.046 --> 00:15:19.657
I don't know
what angels are.

220
00:15:19.831 --> 00:15:21.833
but I know
what they are not.

221
00:15:22.008 --> 00:15:24.358
And what they are not
is a great comfort to me.

222
00:15:26.186 --> 00:15:27.883
I love you. Flannery.

223
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.673
Well. that's
not a proposal.

224
00:15:37.197 --> 00:15:40.548
You know me. I have--
I have a lot of eggs to fry.

225
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:48.730
You let me know when you're done
with breakfast. then.

226
00:16:16.758 --> 00:16:18.455
FLANNERY [Narrating]:
<i>Speaking with Lucynell</i>

227
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:20.631
<i>was like speaking with a dog
who has been trained</i>

228
00:16:20.805 --> 00:16:22.416
<i>to say a few words.</i>

229
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.331
<i>but once addressed.</i>

230
00:16:24.505 --> 00:16:27.247
<i>becomes overcome with
inadequacy and forgets them.</i>

231
00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:29.031
That's a bird.

232
00:16:35.907 --> 00:16:37.692
Bird.

233
00:16:37.866 --> 00:16:39.172
Yeah.

234
00:16:50.096 --> 00:16:52.098
<i>Now arriving. station stop.</i>

235
00:16:52.272 --> 00:16:54.970
<i>Wilmington. Delaware.
Wilmington. Delaware.</i>

236
00:17:04.588 --> 00:17:05.981
Bird.

237
00:17:07.678 --> 00:17:09.115
Bird!

238
00:17:11.769 --> 00:17:13.380
Teach her
to say something else.

239
00:17:13.554 --> 00:17:15.643
LUCYNELL [In distance]:
Bird.

240
00:17:15.817 --> 00:17:17.471
What you want her
to say next?

241
00:17:17.645 --> 00:17:18.602
Bird.

242
00:17:20.735 --> 00:17:22.302
Teach her to say...

243
00:17:23.912 --> 00:17:25.740
..."sugar pie."

244
00:17:25.914 --> 00:17:27.611
Bird.

245
00:17:29.396 --> 00:17:30.614
Bird.

246
00:17:30.788 --> 00:17:32.007
Sugar pie.

247
00:17:33.269 --> 00:17:35.054
LUCYNELL [Voice echoing]:
Bird.

248
00:17:36.098 --> 00:17:37.230
Bird.

249
00:17:39.667 --> 00:17:40.798
Bird.

250
00:17:44.106 --> 00:17:46.065
Bird.

251
00:17:50.982 --> 00:17:52.201
Bird.

252
00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:54.638
Bird.

253
00:17:55.726 --> 00:17:56.771
Bird.

254
00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:01.036
Bird.

255
00:18:19.272 --> 00:18:20.577
Bird. Bird.

256
00:18:21.839 --> 00:18:24.320
That'll be $3.50.

257
00:18:24.494 --> 00:18:25.974
Sugar pie.

258
00:18:28.324 --> 00:18:29.804
LUCYNELL [Voice echoing]:
Bird.

259
00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.069
Yeah okay.
We got three dollars...

260
00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:37.203
Well. that didn't satisfy me none.

261
00:18:37.377 --> 00:18:39.030
That was just something
a woman in an office did.

262
00:18:39.205 --> 00:18:40.815
paperwork and blood tests.

263
00:18:40.989 --> 00:18:42.512
Well. it satisfied the law.

264
00:18:42.686 --> 00:18:44.688
Well. you can cut
my heart out.

265
00:18:44.862 --> 00:18:46.125
You can look at my heart.

266
00:18:46.299 --> 00:18:47.648
and you wouldn't know
a thing about me.

267
00:18:47.822 --> 00:18:49.954
Well. just look how pretty
Lucynell looks.

268
00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:52.435
She looks
like a baby doll.

269
00:18:52.609 --> 00:18:53.828
Hey. listen.

270
00:18:55.264 --> 00:18:57.223
You got a prize.

271
00:18:58.485 --> 00:19:01.096
What do they know
about my blood. huh?

272
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.880
I mean. what--

273
00:19:03.054 --> 00:19:04.708
hey.

274
00:19:04.882 --> 00:19:06.493
Now. I ain't never been

275
00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:08.625
parted with her
for more than two days before.

276
00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:10.497
Mm-hmm.

277
00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:14.109
So. I wouldn't let
no man have her but you.

278
00:19:14.283 --> 00:19:16.372
'cause I've seen you.
You do right.

279
00:19:18.069 --> 00:19:21.421
All right. I'll see you
in a couple of days. okay?

280
00:19:21.595 --> 00:19:23.858
Okay.

281
00:19:24.032 --> 00:19:25.294
Bye-bye. sugar baby.

282
00:19:25.468 --> 00:19:27.035
- Bye-bye.
- All right. bye.

283
00:19:27.209 --> 00:19:29.907
Take care of her.

284
00:19:30.081 --> 00:19:32.301
Take care of my car!
You hear?

285
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.056
The life you save may be
your own.

286
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.102
<i>♪ Come softly. darling ♪</i>

287
00:19:51.277 --> 00:19:53.409
<i>♪ Come softly ♪</i>

288
00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:57.196
Your mama thinks $17.50
is enough for two days.

289
00:19:58.893 --> 00:20:00.721
It takes money.

290
00:20:00.895 --> 00:20:02.984
You got me. girl?

291
00:20:03.158 --> 00:20:04.464
I said--

292
00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:06.292
you know. some people--

293
00:20:06.466 --> 00:20:09.512
some people. they'll do anything
anyhow these days.

294
00:20:09.686 --> 00:20:11.732
The way I think.
I wouldn't marry me a woman

295
00:20:11.906 --> 00:20:13.560
if I couldn't take her on
a trip

296
00:20:13.734 --> 00:20:14.822
like she was somebody.

297
00:20:14.996 --> 00:20:15.953
You know?

298
00:20:17.303 --> 00:20:20.697
I mean. you know.
take her to a hotel.

299
00:20:20.871 --> 00:20:22.395
treat her.

300
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.747
<i>♪ I love. I love you so ♪</i>

301
00:20:26.921 --> 00:20:28.357
Hey. stop it. Hey!

302
00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:30.925
I wouldn't marry
the Duchess of Windsor

303
00:20:31.099 --> 00:20:32.883
if I couldn't take her
on a trip.

304
00:20:33.057 --> 00:20:35.277
and get her to. like. a hotel.

305
00:20:35.451 --> 00:20:37.410
and get her something nice
to eat.

306
00:20:39.107 --> 00:20:41.631
God damn it. Stop!
See. I almost crashed.

307
00:20:44.765 --> 00:20:45.766
God!

308
00:20:47.028 --> 00:20:49.378
I'm sorry. You hungry?

309
00:20:49.552 --> 00:20:52.120
You want to get something
to eat. huh?

310
00:20:52.294 --> 00:20:53.556
How about that?

311
00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.222
Can I help you?

312
00:21:07.396 --> 00:21:09.050
Can I get. uh. two plates
of ham and grits.

313
00:21:09.224 --> 00:21:11.139
please. sir?

314
00:21:11.313 --> 00:21:12.923
Coming right up.

315
00:21:32.073 --> 00:21:33.248
Hey.

316
00:21:41.387 --> 00:21:44.390
Hey. Yeah. Can I...
Just one.

317
00:21:44.564 --> 00:21:45.913
I'll pay for it now.

318
00:21:46.087 --> 00:21:48.307
Just give it to her
when she wakes up. okay?

319
00:21:48.481 --> 00:21:50.004
She looks like
an angel of God.

320
00:21:50.178 --> 00:21:51.962
No. She's a hitcher.

321
00:21:52.136 --> 00:21:54.269
No time.
gotta make Tuscaloosa.

322
00:21:55.705 --> 00:21:57.446
Thought leads to action. right?

323
00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.536
What if I could write a poem
about a skunk?

324
00:22:02.712 --> 00:22:04.671
A skunk named Frederick

325
00:22:04.845 --> 00:22:08.892
who smells like
a strawberry malted milkshake.

326
00:22:12.505 --> 00:22:14.898
But I wrote this poem

327
00:22:15.072 --> 00:22:17.597
so honestly.

328
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:20.513
and I imagine this possibility
of Frank.

329
00:22:20.687 --> 00:22:24.386
the sweet-scented skunk.
so thoroughly

330
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.519
that people saw each and every
black and white creature

331
00:22:26.693 --> 00:22:29.435
slinking around their farmyards
in some new. caring way.

332
00:22:32.438 --> 00:22:33.830
They weren't afraid.

333
00:22:34.004 --> 00:22:35.528
They wondered...

334
00:22:35.702 --> 00:22:37.486
"Is that Frank?"

335
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.450
And could their
newfound interest and curiosity

336
00:22:44.624 --> 00:22:47.278
positively impact all those
slinking. stinky skunks?

337
00:22:47.453 --> 00:22:49.193
I think so.

338
00:22:52.458 --> 00:22:53.981
Station stop. next stop

339
00:22:54.155 --> 00:22:56.200
is Milledgeville. Georgia.

340
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:59.247
And if imagination
impacts reality.

341
00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:02.250
then isn't faith where those
rivers meet?

342
00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.217
Ah!

343
00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:14.436
Mary Flannery!

344
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:22.575
Hey. sweetheart.

345
00:23:23.793 --> 00:23:25.665
Well. let me help you
with that.

346
00:23:25.839 --> 00:23:27.493
No. I'll take my typewriter.
thank you.

347
00:23:27.667 --> 00:23:29.364
- You can take my trunk.
- Well. let me take something.

348
00:23:29.538 --> 00:23:31.235
- Thank you.
- All right. Are you all right?

349
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.459
Think Milledgeville
has improved?

350
00:23:37.633 --> 00:23:38.939
It's still here.

351
00:23:40.331 --> 00:23:43.422
Well. two of the stores
have new fronts.

352
00:23:46.773 --> 00:23:48.470
Aunt Katie's sleeping
in the car.

353
00:23:48.644 --> 00:23:50.733
so let's keep our voices down
when we get up there. all right?

354
00:23:50.907 --> 00:23:52.779
What's Dutchess doing
sleeping in the car?

355
00:23:54.868 --> 00:23:57.653
Well. you know.

356
00:23:57.827 --> 00:23:59.829
I don't like to come all the way
out here by myself.

357
00:24:00.917 --> 00:24:02.789
No. there are...

358
00:24:02.963 --> 00:24:06.357
more of them now
than there are of us.

359
00:24:09.404 --> 00:24:11.101
I'm taking you to Dr. Block
on the way home.

360
00:24:11.275 --> 00:24:12.538
I'm not going to Dr. Block.

361
00:24:12.712 --> 00:24:15.932
He will take a personal
interest in you.

362
00:24:16.106 --> 00:24:17.281
None of those doctors
up there'll

363
00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:19.022
take a personal interest
in you.

364
00:24:19.196 --> 00:24:20.763
I don't want anyone taking
a personal interest in me.

365
00:24:20.937 --> 00:24:22.504
- I want to go home.
- What in the world?

366
00:24:22.678 --> 00:24:25.159
Mary Flannery. what are you a
hobo? What is this?

367
00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.468
We need to get you
a proper Yankee coat.

368
00:24:29.642 --> 00:24:30.947
I know what
the temperature is.

369
00:24:31.121 --> 00:24:32.775
and I'm old enough
to pick out my own coat--

370
00:24:32.949 --> 00:24:34.342
I know you don't feel well.

371
00:24:34.516 --> 00:24:36.953
but let's try and have
a nicer disposition.

372
00:24:37.127 --> 00:24:38.955
There's no need
to wake up Sissy.

373
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.350
<i>Many governors on both sides</i>

374
00:24:42.524 --> 00:24:46.049
<i>of the Mason and Dixon line
have talked</i>

375
00:24:46.223 --> 00:24:48.748
<i>of the need for unity on
the issue of civil rights.</i>

376
00:24:48.922 --> 00:24:51.359
<i>It's suggested that
the Stevens-Russell team</i>

377
00:24:51.533 --> 00:24:52.926
<i>might provide
the proper balance...</i>

378
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.103
Oh. Mary Flannery.
Hey. sweetheart.

379
00:24:56.277 --> 00:24:58.105
Look at you.

380
00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:00.020
<i>...governors here
are making large</i>

381
00:25:00.194 --> 00:25:01.804
<i>and enthusiastic noises
for General Eisenhower.</i>

382
00:25:01.978 --> 00:25:04.328
Oh. you don't look very well.

383
00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:06.113
Regina. she looks sick.

384
00:25:06.287 --> 00:25:08.028
I know.
I'm taking her to Dr. Block.

385
00:25:08.202 --> 00:25:09.769
I'm not going
to Dr. Block.

386
00:25:09.943 --> 00:25:11.901
She has chills and that rash.

387
00:25:12.075 --> 00:25:14.077
<i>...would switch to the
general on the second ballot.</i>

388
00:25:14.251 --> 00:25:15.557
She says her arms are too heavy

389
00:25:15.731 --> 00:25:17.385
to lift up to reach
the typewriter.

390
00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:18.908
<i>...the governors we
already talked to</i>

391
00:25:19.082 --> 00:25:20.606
<i>or where the switches
might come.</i>

392
00:25:22.216 --> 00:25:23.609
You. uh--

393
00:25:23.783 --> 00:25:26.481
You've been writing
any cute stories lately?

394
00:25:26.655 --> 00:25:28.135
No.

395
00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:30.920
Oh. you must be writing something.

396
00:25:31.094 --> 00:25:34.010
I read that last one
you sent your mama.

397
00:25:34.184 --> 00:25:36.317
And?

398
00:25:36.491 --> 00:25:39.668
I-- I must admit. you know.
it wasn't for me.

399
00:25:41.365 --> 00:25:43.629
Left kind of a-- a bad taste
in my mouth.

400
00:25:43.803 --> 00:25:45.239
Well. you weren't supposed to
eat it.

401
00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.329
Oh. don't be coy.
Oh. come on.

402
00:25:48.503 --> 00:25:49.852
Tell us what you're
working on.

403
00:25:50.026 --> 00:25:52.855
I'm writing a novel.

404
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:55.118
It's called Wise Blood.

405
00:25:55.292 --> 00:25:57.599
It's about an atheist who sleeps
with a prostitute.

406
00:25:57.773 --> 00:25:59.079
and then starts his own
religion called

407
00:25:59.253 --> 00:26:00.950
The Church of Christ
Without Christ.

408
00:26:02.996 --> 00:26:04.954
I'm thinking at the end. he
might scratch out his own eyes.

409
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.788
A church without Christ?

410
00:26:12.962 --> 00:26:14.964
Like most of the ones
I know.

411
00:26:15.138 --> 00:26:17.880
Well. you can write about
nice people this time.

412
00:26:18.054 --> 00:26:21.667
Maybe you'll be another
Margaret Mitchell.

413
00:26:21.841 --> 00:26:25.453
We need another good book
like Gone with the Wind.

414
00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:29.065
Put the war in it.
That always makes a long book.

415
00:26:29.239 --> 00:26:31.677
I love... that... movie.

416
00:26:33.243 --> 00:26:35.202
That colored gal
that played Mammy.

417
00:26:35.376 --> 00:26:38.335
oh. she just tickles me.

418
00:26:40.424 --> 00:26:43.210
It's so nice to see
a respectable Negress.

419
00:26:43.384 --> 00:26:45.560
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

420
00:26:45.734 --> 00:26:48.128
"Ashley. Ashley.
What ever will I do?"

421
00:26:50.478 --> 00:26:52.567
FLANNERY [Narrating]:
<i>Sometimes. Ruby Turpin</i>

422
00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:54.569
<i>occupied herself</i>

423
00:26:54.743 --> 00:26:56.702
<i>by naming the classes
of people.</i>

424
00:26:56.876 --> 00:26:59.139
<i>On the bottom of the heap
were most colored people.</i>

425
00:26:59.313 --> 00:27:00.749
<i>Not all. but most of them.</i>

426
00:27:02.446 --> 00:27:04.884
<i>Then. next to them. not above.
just away from.</i>

427
00:27:05.058 --> 00:27:06.712
<i>were the white trash.</i>

428
00:27:06.886 --> 00:27:09.105
<i>Then. above them were
the homeowners.</i>

429
00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:11.151
<i>and above them.
the home and landowners.</i>

430
00:27:11.325 --> 00:27:14.807
<i>to which she and her husband.
Claud. belonged.</i>

431
00:27:14.981 --> 00:27:17.070
<i>Above she and Claud were people
with a lot of money.</i>

432
00:27:17.244 --> 00:27:20.247
<i>and much bigger houses
and much more land.</i>

433
00:27:21.291 --> 00:27:22.684
<i>But here.
the complexity of it</i>

434
00:27:22.858 --> 00:27:25.165
<i>would begin to bear in
on Ruby.</i>

435
00:27:25.339 --> 00:27:27.123
<i>For some of the people
with a lot of money</i>

436
00:27:27.297 --> 00:27:29.822
<i>were common. and ought to be
below she and Claud.</i>

437
00:27:29.996 --> 00:27:31.737
<i>And some of the people
who had good blood</i>

438
00:27:31.911 --> 00:27:34.043
<i>had lost their money
and had to rent.</i>

439
00:27:34.217 --> 00:27:35.958
<i>And then. there were
some colored people</i>

440
00:27:36.132 --> 00:27:38.831
<i>who owned their homes
and land as well.</i>

441
00:27:39.005 --> 00:27:40.267
Sit down.

442
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:42.051
You know you can't stand on
that leg.

443
00:27:42.225 --> 00:27:43.923
He has an ulcer
on his leg.

444
00:27:46.534 --> 00:27:49.189
My! How did you do
that?

445
00:27:49.363 --> 00:27:50.625
A cow kicked him.

446
00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:53.367
Oh. goodness.

447
00:27:53.541 --> 00:27:55.935
The doctor will see you
now. Mr. Mulligan.

448
00:27:59.025 --> 00:28:00.679
FLANNERY [Narrating]:
<i>Usually. by the time</i>

449
00:28:00.853 --> 00:28:02.985
<i>she had fallen asleep.
all the classes of people</i>

450
00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:05.858
<i>were moiling and roiling
around in her head.</i>

451
00:28:06.032 --> 00:28:08.338
<i>And she would dream they were
all crammed in together</i>

452
00:28:08.512 --> 00:28:12.429
<i>in a boxcar. being ridden off
to be put in a gas oven.</i>

453
00:28:13.517 --> 00:28:15.041
Ooh. Lord.

454
00:28:17.783 --> 00:28:18.958
I wish I could reduce.

455
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.352
Oh. you aren't fat.

456
00:28:22.526 --> 00:28:24.572
Oooh. I am. too.

457
00:28:24.746 --> 00:28:27.140
Oh. Claud. he-- he can eat
all he wants to.

458
00:28:27.314 --> 00:28:29.446
He never weighs more than
175 pounds.

459
00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.144
But me? I just--

460
00:28:31.318 --> 00:28:34.147
I look at something good to eat.
and I gain weight.

461
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.195
You-- You can eat all you want
to. can't you. Claud. hmm?

462
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.983
Well. as long as you have
such a good disposition.

463
00:28:44.157 --> 00:28:45.680
I don't think it makes
a bit of difference

464
00:28:45.854 --> 00:28:47.073
what size you are.

465
00:28:47.247 --> 00:28:48.596
You just...

466
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:52.513
You just can't beat
a good disposition.

467
00:28:56.604 --> 00:28:58.345
You must be in college.

468
00:28:58.519 --> 00:29:01.261
reading a book there.

469
00:29:01.435 --> 00:29:03.654
Lady asked you a question.
Mary Grace.

470
00:29:03.829 --> 00:29:05.308
I have ears.

471
00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:10.313
<i>As we start to pray...</i>

472
00:29:10.487 --> 00:29:12.576
It's wonderful weather.
isn't it?

473
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:14.883
Oh. well. it's good weather
for cotton.

474
00:29:15.057 --> 00:29:17.059
if you can get the Negroes
to pick it.

475
00:29:17.233 --> 00:29:20.062
But they don't want to
pick cotton anymore.

476
00:29:20.236 --> 00:29:21.672
But you can't get the white
folks to pick it.

477
00:29:21.847 --> 00:29:23.065
and now you can't get
the Negroes.

478
00:29:23.239 --> 00:29:24.458
'cause they got to be
right up there

479
00:29:24.632 --> 00:29:26.155
with the white folk.

480
00:29:26.329 --> 00:29:27.940
They ought to send them
all back to Africa.

481
00:29:28.114 --> 00:29:30.377
That's where they come from
in the first place.

482
00:29:32.379 --> 00:29:34.381
Heap of things worse than
a Negro.

483
00:29:36.818 --> 00:29:39.386
It's all kinds of them.
Like all kinds of us.

484
00:29:41.301 --> 00:29:42.606
Hmm! Yes. indeed.

485
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:45.609
A heap of things worse.

486
00:29:50.092 --> 00:29:51.528
Hmm.

487
00:29:51.702 --> 00:29:52.791
Ruby.

488
00:29:52.965 --> 00:29:54.749
Hmm.

489
00:30:00.624 --> 00:30:02.191
Ruby.

490
00:30:04.628 --> 00:30:05.891
Ruby.

491
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:10.417
You will be reborn.

492
00:30:10.591 --> 00:30:13.072
But there are only
two spaces available

493
00:30:13.246 --> 00:30:14.638
for you on Earth.

494
00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:18.947
You can either be a nigger
or white trash.

495
00:30:21.515 --> 00:30:22.559
No.

496
00:30:23.604 --> 00:30:25.736
Please. Jesus--

497
00:30:25.911 --> 00:30:28.304
please. just let me
be myself.

498
00:30:30.089 --> 00:30:32.613
Or let me wait until there's
another place available.

499
00:30:32.787 --> 00:30:34.267
No.

500
00:30:34.441 --> 00:30:35.616
You have to go
right now.

501
00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.924
and I have only
those two spaces.

502
00:30:39.098 --> 00:30:40.142
so make up your mind.

503
00:30:41.535 --> 00:30:42.928
Oh...

504
00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:48.063
Well. make me
a Negro then.

505
00:30:48.237 --> 00:30:50.849
but-- but not
a trashy one.

506
00:30:51.023 --> 00:30:53.416
Make me a--

507
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:54.940
a neat. clean.

508
00:30:55.114 --> 00:30:58.465
respectable Negro woman.

509
00:30:58.639 --> 00:31:00.423
Myself...

510
00:31:00.597 --> 00:31:01.729
but Black.

511
00:31:16.004 --> 00:31:17.353
Did you hear that
the Mexicans

512
00:31:17.527 --> 00:31:20.574
want to translate the Bible
into Spanish?

513
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:27.146
I think the worst thing in the
world is an ungrateful person.

514
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.669
Hmm.

515
00:31:28.843 --> 00:31:31.715
To have everything
and not appreciate it.

516
00:31:33.108 --> 00:31:37.852
I know a girl whose parents
would give her anything.

517
00:31:38.026 --> 00:31:40.811
who's getting
a good education.

518
00:31:40.986 --> 00:31:43.597
who wears the best clothes.

519
00:31:43.771 --> 00:31:48.123
but who never has a kind word
to say to anyone.

520
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.955
It never hurt anyone
to smile.

521
00:31:54.129 --> 00:31:57.785
It just-- It just makes you
feel better.

522
00:31:57.959 --> 00:31:59.526
Just all over.

523
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.310
Of course.

524
00:32:01.484 --> 00:32:03.312
But there are some people
you can't tell anything to.

525
00:32:04.705 --> 00:32:07.751
Well. if it's one thing I am.
it's grateful.

526
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:10.493
When I think of...

527
00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:13.583
who all I could have
been beside myself.

528
00:32:13.757 --> 00:32:15.672
and what all I got.

529
00:32:15.846 --> 00:32:20.590
a little bit of everything
and a good disposition besides.

530
00:32:20.764 --> 00:32:22.810
I just...

531
00:32:22.984 --> 00:32:24.855
I just want to shout.
"Oh. thank you. Jesus."

532
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.075
Thank you.
Thank you. Jesus.

533
00:32:27.249 --> 00:32:30.600
for making everything
the way it is."

534
00:32:32.167 --> 00:32:34.691
Oh. thank you. Jesus.
thank you.

535
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:44.614
What you got
to say to me?

536
00:32:44.788 --> 00:32:48.836
Go back to hell where
you came from. you old warthog!

537
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.534
Nurse! Call the ambulance!

538
00:33:00.065 --> 00:33:01.588
FLANNERY [Narrating]:
<i>A visionary light settled</i>

539
00:33:01.762 --> 00:33:03.329
<i>in her eyes.</i>

540
00:33:03.503 --> 00:33:06.071
<i>She could see souls rumbling
into heaven.</i>

541
00:33:06.245 --> 00:33:08.595
<i>There were whole companies
of white trash</i>

542
00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:10.771
<i>and Black folks
in white robes.</i>

543
00:33:10.945 --> 00:33:12.512
<i>battalions of freaks
and lunatics</i>

544
00:33:12.686 --> 00:33:15.210
<i>shouting and leaping
like frogs.</i>

545
00:33:15.384 --> 00:33:18.126
<i>all clean
for the first time.</i>

546
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.000
<i>She could see by their shocked
and altered faces</i>

547
00:33:22.174 --> 00:33:25.264
<i>that even their virtues
were being burned away.</i>

548
00:33:28.441 --> 00:33:30.660
Sooey. Pig. pig.

549
00:33:44.283 --> 00:33:46.241
<i>Dear Cal.</i>

550
00:33:46.415 --> 00:33:48.417
<i>I left New York.
24 years old.</i>

551
00:33:48.591 --> 00:33:50.724
<i>and arrived back
in Georgia 107.</i>

552
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.553
<i>My bones feel made
of charcoal.</i>

553
00:33:53.727 --> 00:33:56.295
<i>and the fever continues to
cook 'em.</i>

554
00:33:56.469 --> 00:33:58.906
<i>I aim to get back
to New York soon.</i>

555
00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.734
<i>but my mama
is none too favorable</i>

556
00:34:00.908 --> 00:34:04.129
<i>towards any kind of travel
for me at the moment.</i>

557
00:34:04.303 --> 00:34:07.958
<i>But don't worry.
I won't be here long.</i>

558
00:34:08.133 --> 00:34:10.265
<i>Everybody around here thinks
the height of Bohemianism</i>

559
00:34:10.439 --> 00:34:12.572
<i>is wearing slacks
out of the house.</i>

560
00:34:16.315 --> 00:34:18.665
<i>When I get up there. maybe
you'll be ready for lunch.</i>

561
00:34:21.146 --> 00:34:22.756
Oh.

562
00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:24.975
y'all should see our new
preacher singing his sermons.

563
00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.456
He puts a chair out on
the platform

564
00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.545
and he'll call out
for some biblical character

565
00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:31.939
to come out and testify.

566
00:34:32.113 --> 00:34:35.247
He'll say. "Paul. will you
come out and testify?"

567
00:34:35.421 --> 00:34:37.162
And he'll wait for Paul
to sit down.

568
00:34:37.336 --> 00:34:38.815
and then he starts to sing:

569
00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:40.600
♪ Rock of Ages ♪

570
00:34:40.774 --> 00:34:42.819
You know. I think I may have
something in the kitchen

571
00:34:42.993 --> 00:34:44.908
that'll settle
Carramae's stomach.

572
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:47.259
and you know. I need to speak
with Mary Flannery

573
00:34:47.433 --> 00:34:49.304
alone for a minute.
so why don't you run on home?

574
00:34:49.478 --> 00:34:51.350
- I'll call you when I need you.
- Oh. okay.

575
00:34:51.524 --> 00:34:53.221
Okay?
Thank you so very much.

576
00:34:53.395 --> 00:34:54.570
Thank you.

577
00:34:56.224 --> 00:34:57.834
Ugh.

578
00:34:58.008 --> 00:34:59.836
You suppose they imagined
that the Apostle Paul

579
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.012
is really coming down
to sit in that chair?

580
00:35:03.927 --> 00:35:06.016
I have no idea
what they imagined.

581
00:35:06.191 --> 00:35:08.280
Look at this.

582
00:35:10.369 --> 00:35:12.675
Dr. Wells gave
an educational meeting

583
00:35:12.849 --> 00:35:14.634
at the college the other day.

584
00:35:14.808 --> 00:35:18.812
and two Negroes-- teachers or
superintendents or something.

585
00:35:18.986 --> 00:35:20.683
they attended.

586
00:35:20.857 --> 00:35:22.076
How'd that go?

587
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.209
Well. everybody's losing
their minds.

588
00:35:24.383 --> 00:35:26.776
They burned a cross
on Dr. Wells's side lawn.

589
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.778
You think that's funny?

590
00:35:28.952 --> 00:35:32.086
Well. it was too damp out
for a fiery cross.

591
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.610
so they set up
a portable one.

592
00:35:34.784 --> 00:35:38.571
It was lit up with red electric bulbs.

593
00:35:38.745 --> 00:35:41.791
All these people couldn't have
gone past the fourth grade.

594
00:35:41.965 --> 00:35:43.315
Nice to know
they're so interested

595
00:35:43.489 --> 00:35:45.708
in education all of a sudden.

596
00:35:45.882 --> 00:35:47.362
Mary Flannery. sit-- sit.

597
00:35:47.536 --> 00:35:49.364
Please stay for a minute. please.

598
00:35:49.538 --> 00:35:51.453
No. I--
I need to be working.

599
00:35:53.934 --> 00:35:55.501
You need to rest.

600
00:35:57.242 --> 00:35:59.548
And to get your strength.

601
00:35:59.722 --> 00:36:02.203
I think I'm strong enough
to type. Regina.

602
00:36:02.377 --> 00:36:03.770
Well. that is not...

603
00:36:05.337 --> 00:36:07.991
...what the doctor says.

604
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:12.866
And... Dr. Block is coming out
here this morning

605
00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.128
to speak with us.

606
00:36:14.302 --> 00:36:16.348
What's this?

607
00:36:16.522 --> 00:36:18.088
What's this for?

608
00:36:21.918 --> 00:36:23.355
Is this for me?

609
00:36:29.099 --> 00:36:31.232
Regina.

610
00:36:31.406 --> 00:36:33.060
Chancey says the cow

611
00:36:33.234 --> 00:36:35.323
that's got the bad quarter's
gonna have to see the vet.

612
00:36:35.497 --> 00:36:38.152
Oh. all right. okay. Well. then.
come on. now. Let's go.

613
00:36:38.326 --> 00:36:40.459
Oh. if there's one thing
I don't like. it's needles.

614
00:36:40.633 --> 00:36:42.678
We'll be right back.
I've always said it.

615
00:36:44.158 --> 00:36:45.812
This is enormous.

616
00:36:45.986 --> 00:36:47.944
It looks like it's for
a farm animal.

617
00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:51.252
I think I'd rather have arthritis.

618
00:36:59.478 --> 00:37:01.523
Mary Flannery.

619
00:37:01.697 --> 00:37:04.657
You don't have arthritis.

620
00:37:05.919 --> 00:37:07.964
You have lupus.

621
00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:11.229
Now. you're
an adult now.

622
00:37:12.534 --> 00:37:16.451
And you need to know...

623
00:37:16.625 --> 00:37:19.149
your mama. she didn't want
you to worry.

624
00:37:19.324 --> 00:37:21.978
You were already weak.

625
00:37:22.152 --> 00:37:23.937
and she just thought
it would...

626
00:37:25.982 --> 00:37:27.897
She doesn't want you
to think

627
00:37:28.071 --> 00:37:29.464
that there isn't any hope.

628
00:37:32.946 --> 00:37:35.122
Because it's not like
when your daddy had it.

629
00:37:36.384 --> 00:37:38.038
See. nowadays.

630
00:37:38.212 --> 00:37:41.955
nowadays. doctors
don't let young people die.

631
00:37:42.129 --> 00:37:44.436
They give 'em some of these
new medicines.

632
00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:47.308
People don't die...

633
00:37:49.136 --> 00:37:50.703
...like they used to.

634
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.144
Well. that's not
good news...

635
00:37:58.711 --> 00:38:01.453
...but I can't thank you enough
for telling me.

636
00:38:01.627 --> 00:38:05.326
I thought I had lupus.
and I thought I was going crazy.

637
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.676
I'd a lot rather be
sick than crazy.

638
00:38:09.243 --> 00:38:10.940
But don't tell Regina
that you told me.

639
00:38:11.114 --> 00:38:13.160
because if you do.

640
00:38:13.334 --> 00:38:14.944
she'll never tell you anything
ever again.

641
00:38:15.118 --> 00:38:16.685
And I might like to know
something else

642
00:38:16.859 --> 00:38:18.470
about myself sometime.

643
00:38:18.644 --> 00:38:19.601
Okay?

644
00:38:23.823 --> 00:38:24.867
Thank you.

645
00:39:01.164 --> 00:39:02.818
I'm working.

646
00:39:02.992 --> 00:39:05.821
I told you not to enter my room
when I'm working.

647
00:39:07.214 --> 00:39:09.259
I know that.

648
00:39:09.434 --> 00:39:12.959
but you need to come on down
now. when you're ready.

649
00:39:13.133 --> 00:39:14.700
Rinehart rejected my novel.

650
00:39:17.659 --> 00:39:18.965
I'm sure
that's very disappointing.

651
00:39:19.139 --> 00:39:20.880
but the doctor's
downstairs now.

652
00:39:21.054 --> 00:39:23.665
How long have you known?

653
00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:25.232
Known what?

654
00:39:27.103 --> 00:39:29.584
I look just like Daddy.

655
00:39:29.758 --> 00:39:31.281
No. you don't.

656
00:39:33.458 --> 00:39:35.285
You go talk to the doctor.

657
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.984
I don't need one.
I need a priest.

658
00:40:06.752 --> 00:40:08.406
<i>The reality of death</i>

659
00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:12.018
<i>has come upon me.</i>

660
00:40:12.192 --> 00:40:14.455
<i>And a consciousness
of the power of God</i>

661
00:40:14.629 --> 00:40:18.372
<i>has broken my complacency
like a bullet in the side.</i>

662
00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:26.728
<i>A sense of the dramatic.</i>

663
00:40:26.902 --> 00:40:28.600
<i>of the tragic.
of the infinite.</i>

664
00:40:28.774 --> 00:40:31.167
<i>has descended.

665
00:40:33.039 --> 00:40:34.519
<i>But even more
than grief...</i>

666
00:40:36.259 --> 00:40:37.696
<i>...wonder.</i>

667
00:40:58.978 --> 00:41:00.283

<i>They tell me I've won</i>

670
00:41:04.766 --> 00:41:06.420
<i>the Rinehart-Iowa
Fiction Award.</i>

671
00:41:06.594 --> 00:41:08.509
<i>It means $750 from a respected
New York publisher</i>

672
00:41:08.683 --> 00:41:11.207
<i>and gives them an option

673
00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:13.471
<i>if I can ever finish it.</i>

674
00:41:13.645 --> 00:41:15.298
<i>I hope you and Duchess

680
00:41:32.272 --> 00:41:35.971
All right. Flannery.
the room is yours.

681
00:41:49.332 --> 00:41:51.509
This story's called
Parker's Back.

682
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:03.129
Sarah Ruth
was plain plain.

683
00:42:03.303 --> 00:42:04.826
<i>The skin on her
face was thin</i>

684
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.611
<i>and drawn tight
as the skin on an onion.</i>

685
00:42:06.785 --> 00:42:08.787
<i>And her eyes were gray
and sharp</i>

686
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:10.789
<i>like the points
of two ice picks.</i>

687
00:42:10.963 --> 00:42:13.182
Come on. God...

688
00:42:13.356 --> 00:42:15.010
Damn it!
God damn it to hell.

689
00:42:15.184 --> 00:42:17.404
Hey.
Jesus Christ.

690
00:42:17.578 --> 00:42:19.406
We don't talk no filth here.
Huh?

691
00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.800
We don't talk
no filth here.

692
00:42:21.974 --> 00:42:23.628
Oh. okay.
Okay. okay. okay.

693
00:42:23.802 --> 00:42:25.194
Hey. hey.

694
00:42:25.368 --> 00:42:27.762
I just-- It's my hand.
I hurt my hand.

695
00:42:27.936 --> 00:42:29.198
I think it's broken.

696
00:42:30.243 --> 00:42:31.592
Let me see.

697
00:42:33.986 --> 00:42:34.900
Your hand's fine.

698
00:42:35.074 --> 00:42:35.988
Well. I'm cured.

699
00:42:36.162 --> 00:42:39.295
Oh!
Okay.

700
00:42:39.469 --> 00:42:41.776
All right. Be careful
with me now. all right?

701
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:44.083
I'm a Navy man.
I've been all around the world.

702
00:42:44.257 --> 00:42:46.520
I could teach you
a thing or two. all right?

703
00:42:46.694 --> 00:42:49.610
This right here.
got this in Cape Horn.

704
00:42:50.655 --> 00:42:52.047
Got this one in Burma.

705
00:42:52.221 --> 00:42:54.397
I got this one here
when I was 15 years old.

706
00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:56.835
Don't tell me. I don't like it.
I ain't got any use for it.

707
00:42:57.009 --> 00:42:59.489
- It's idolatry.
- Hold on a second.

708
00:42:59.664 --> 00:43:01.056
You ought to see the ones
you can't see.

709
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.536
All that there
is nothing better than

710
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:03.755
what a fool Indian
would do.

711
00:43:03.929 --> 00:43:05.495
Vanity.
Vanity of vanities.

712
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:07.193
Hold on a second.

713
00:43:07.367 --> 00:43:08.586
You must like one of these
a bit more than the rest.

714
00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.544
I mean. take a good look
at this here.

715
00:43:10.718 --> 00:43:12.981
Chicken ain't so bad.

716
00:43:13.155 --> 00:43:14.243
A chicken?

717
00:43:14.417 --> 00:43:16.376
Girly. this is an eagle.

718
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.291
What kind of fool a would put
a chicken on himself?

719
00:43:18.465 --> 00:43:20.249
Well. what kind of a fool
would have any of it?

720
00:43:25.559 --> 00:43:27.430
You saved?

721
00:43:27.605 --> 00:43:28.649
Saved?

722
00:43:31.217 --> 00:43:33.088
I don't really know
what I would need saving from.

723
00:43:34.437 --> 00:43:37.223
Would a kiss from you
take care of that. though?

724
00:43:37.397 --> 00:43:38.441
What's your name?

725
00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:40.269
Parker.

726
00:43:40.443 --> 00:43:42.489
O.E. Parker.

727
00:43:42.663 --> 00:43:44.752
What's the "O.E." stand for?

728
00:43:44.926 --> 00:43:47.494
Never mind that.
What's your name?

729
00:43:47.668 --> 00:43:48.887
I'll tell you if you tell me

730
00:43:49.061 --> 00:43:51.629
what them letters
are the short of.

731
00:43:51.803 --> 00:43:53.500
Nah. nah. I can't do that.

732
00:43:53.674 --> 00:43:56.416
You'll just go blabbing it
all around town.

733
00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:57.635
I won't.

734
00:43:58.853 --> 00:44:00.550
I swear.

735
00:44:00.725 --> 00:44:02.117
Swear to God.

736
00:44:03.684 --> 00:44:05.468
All right.

737
00:44:07.296 --> 00:44:09.429
All right. I will then.

738
00:44:09.603 --> 00:44:12.214
That's a secret now. You can't
tell anybody. all right?

739
00:44:12.388 --> 00:44:13.651
Come here close.

740
00:44:14.869 --> 00:44:16.523
My name...

741
00:44:16.697 --> 00:44:21.006
is Obadiah Elihue Parker.

742
00:44:22.094 --> 00:44:24.357
Means "servant of God."

743
00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.317
Hey!

744
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:31.146
You kids want some apples?

745
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.582
Yeah!
Come on.

746
00:44:34.019 --> 00:44:36.151
Now. I think I'll come by tomorrow.

747
00:44:37.196 --> 00:44:38.937
I'll bring you
some blackberries.

748
00:44:39.111 --> 00:44:40.373
How about that?

749
00:44:41.722 --> 00:44:43.550
Dive in. everybody. Come on.

750
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:47.032
Say "thank you."

751
00:44:47.206 --> 00:44:48.816
Thank you!

752
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.600
FLANNERY [Narrating]:
<i>It was as if a blind boy</i>

753
00:44:50.775 --> 00:44:52.777
<i>had been turned so gently
in a different direction</i>

754
00:44:52.951 --> 00:44:54.343
<i>that he did not know</i>

755
00:44:54.517 --> 00:44:56.302
<i>his destination
had been changed.</i>

756
00:45:05.877 --> 00:45:07.705
Parker. no.
Not till I'm married.

757
00:45:07.879 --> 00:45:10.098
- Oh. come on.
- Parker. no!

758
00:45:10.272 --> 00:45:12.405
What. are you.
one of them Suffragettes?

759
00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.930
A lesbian?

760
00:45:16.104 --> 00:45:17.845
I don't divide people up
into boys and girls.

761
00:45:18.019 --> 00:45:21.849
I divide them up by irritating
and less irritating.

762
00:45:23.633 --> 00:45:25.984
Oh.

763
00:45:26.158 --> 00:45:30.075
Well... which am I?

764
00:45:30.249 --> 00:45:33.208
Mm-hmm. There's my answer.
Less irritating.

765
00:45:37.082 --> 00:45:40.476
Parker. wait. no. No. really.
Not till I'm married. Parker.

766
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:42.609
- Parker. Parker. Parker!
- Ow. ow!

767
00:45:43.784 --> 00:45:45.177
- Not till we're married! No!
- Come on!

768
00:45:45.351 --> 00:45:46.744
Parker!

769
00:45:51.792 --> 00:45:52.750
Not till
we're married. okay?

770
00:45:55.404 --> 00:45:56.492
Ah.

771
00:45:59.887 --> 00:46:03.369
...Lo.
this is the man

772
00:46:03.543 --> 00:46:05.023
that made not God
his strength.

773
00:46:05.197 --> 00:46:06.981
but trusted in the abundance
of his richness...

774
00:46:07.155 --> 00:46:10.245
and the strength in himself.

775
00:46:10.419 --> 00:46:11.986
FLANNERY [Narrating]:
<i>Sometimes. Parker supposed</i>

776
00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.814
<i>she married him to save him.</i>

777
00:46:13.988 --> 00:46:15.294
<i>At other times.
he had the impression</i>

778
00:46:15.468 --> 00:46:16.861
<i>she actually liked
all the things</i>

779
00:46:17.035 --> 00:46:18.906
<i>she said she despised.</i>

780
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.387
<i>He could account for her
one way or another.</i>

781
00:46:21.561 --> 00:46:23.868
<i>It was himself
he didn't understand.</i>

782
00:46:24.042 --> 00:46:28.263
But I am like a green olive tree
in the house of God.

783
00:46:28.437 --> 00:46:31.571
I trust in the mercy of God
forever and ever.

784
00:46:33.965 --> 00:46:36.837
At the judgment of God.
Jesus is gonna ask you

785
00:46:37.011 --> 00:46:38.404
what you've been doing
all your life

786
00:46:38.578 --> 00:46:41.407
'sides drawing pictures
all over yourself.

787
00:46:41.581 --> 00:46:43.409
Girly.
you ain't fooling nobody.

788
00:46:43.583 --> 00:46:45.237
You're just worried
that big hefty blonde woman

789
00:46:45.411 --> 00:46:47.587
I've been working for is going
to come around one day

790
00:46:47.761 --> 00:46:50.068
and say. "Hey. Mr. Parker.

791
00:46:50.242 --> 00:46:52.331
why don't you and me
just go take off together?"

792
00:46:52.505 --> 00:46:54.463
Now. you are tempting sin.

793
00:46:56.683 --> 00:46:58.163
You should have seen her

794
00:46:58.337 --> 00:46:59.599
the first time she seen me
with my shirt off.

795
00:46:59.773 --> 00:47:01.166
She looked
at me and said.

796
00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:05.474
"Why. Mr. Parker. you are
a regular old panorama."

797
00:47:05.648 --> 00:47:07.215
Now. at the judgment of God.

798
00:47:07.389 --> 00:47:08.651
you'll have to answer
for that too.

799
00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:10.262
Vanity.

800
00:47:10.436 --> 00:47:11.829
See. I'm thinking I'm going to
put a Bible verse

801
00:47:12.003 --> 00:47:13.221
right here on my back

802
00:47:13.395 --> 00:47:14.875
so you have something better
to read.

803
00:47:17.051 --> 00:47:20.881
Now. ain't I...

804
00:47:21.055 --> 00:47:25.364
already got myself
a real fire.

805
00:47:26.452 --> 00:47:28.628
Yeah. but I want you
looking at me.

806
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:39.334
Oh!

807
00:47:39.508 --> 00:47:40.509
All right.

808
00:47:43.469 --> 00:47:45.340
Lift up.

809
00:47:52.086 --> 00:47:54.001
FLANNERY [Narrating]:
<i>Parker understood</i>

810
00:47:54.175 --> 00:47:55.568
<i>why he married her.</i>

811
00:47:55.742 --> 00:47:57.570
<i>He couldn't have her
any other way.</i>

812
00:47:57.744 --> 00:48:00.834
<i>But he couldn't understand
why he stayed with her now.</i>

813
00:48:01.008 --> 00:48:02.662
<i>She would be pregnant soon.</i>

814
00:48:02.836 --> 00:48:05.273
<i>and pregnant women
were not his favorite kind.</i>

815
00:48:07.145 --> 00:48:09.016
<i>He thought of his own head
as a switchbox</i>

816
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:10.931
<i>where he controlled from.</i>

817
00:48:11.105 --> 00:48:14.630
<i>But with her. he could only
imagine the outside in.</i>

818
00:48:14.804 --> 00:48:16.719
<i>The whole black world
in her head.</i>

819
00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:20.114
<i>big enough to include the sky
and the planets.</i>

820
00:48:20.288 --> 00:48:21.637
Shut your mouth.

821
00:48:21.811 --> 00:48:22.943
<i>Whatever had been or would be.</i>

822
00:48:23.117 --> 00:48:24.553
I wanna show
you something

823
00:48:24.727 --> 00:48:25.815
and then I don't want to hear
another word.

824
00:48:27.208 --> 00:48:29.254
<i>When he closed his eyes.</i>

825
00:48:29.428 --> 00:48:31.343
<i>he could see
some type of star.</i>

826
00:48:31.517 --> 00:48:34.215
<i>The kind of star
on a Christmas card.</i>

827
00:48:34.389 --> 00:48:36.783
<i>But he couldn't hold the star
steady in his mind.</i>

828
00:48:36.957 --> 00:48:39.568
<i>He felt as if he were blocked
at the entrance of something.</i>

829
00:48:39.742 --> 00:48:41.396
<i>or as if he was at
the beginning of something</i>

830
00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:43.746
<i>that didn't have a beginning.</i>

831
00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:45.531
<i>He saw the star moving
farther and farther away</i>

832
00:48:45.705 --> 00:48:48.838
<i>into darkness. until he realized</i>

833
00:48:49.013 --> 00:48:51.493
<i>Sarah Ruth
was the pinpoint of light.</i>

834
00:48:53.408 --> 00:48:55.976
<i>A ferocious thud
propelled him into the air.</i>

835
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:57.456
<i>He landed on his back</i>

836
00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:58.936
<i>while the tractor
crashed sideways</i>

837
00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:01.286
<i>and the tree burst
into flames.</i>

838
00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:04.637
<i>He could feel the hot breath of
the burning tree on his face.</i>

839
00:49:04.811 --> 00:49:07.074
<i>If he had known
how to cross himself.</i>

840
00:49:07.248 --> 00:49:08.510
<i>he would have done it.</i>

841
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:12.950
Hey!
Hey. open up!

842
00:49:14.125 --> 00:49:15.865
God.

843
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.042
<i>Parker longed
miserably for Sarah Ruth.</i>

844
00:49:18.216 --> 00:49:20.174
<i>Her sharp tongue
and ice pick eyes</i>

845
00:49:20.348 --> 00:49:22.481
<i>were the only comfort
he could bring to mind.</i>

846
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:26.180
She can't say she don't like
the looks of God.

847
00:49:33.883 --> 00:49:36.016
<i>Then. a calm descended on him.</i>

848
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:39.324
<i>as nerve-shattering as
if the long. barn-like room</i>

849
00:49:39.498 --> 00:49:42.675
<i>were a ship from which Jonah
had been cast into the sea.</i>

850
00:49:47.723 --> 00:49:51.336
<i>It was as if he were himself.
but a stranger to himself.</i>

851
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:53.816
<i>driving into a new country.</i>

852
00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:55.905
<i>though everything he saw
was familiar.</i>

853
00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.691
That blonde woman was here and
she ain't as hefty as you said.

854
00:49:58.865 --> 00:50:00.736
You're gonna have
to pay every penny

855
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:03.130
on that tractor you busted. She
don't keep the insurance on it.

856
00:50:03.304 --> 00:50:05.045
What you doing wasting
electricity in the daylight?

857
00:50:05.219 --> 00:50:07.656
- I ain't got to look at you.
- Shut your mouth!

858
00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.745
You ain't gonna have none of me
this morning.

859
00:50:09.919 --> 00:50:11.356
Look at me. all right?

860
00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:12.835
Look at me. I want to show you
something. okay?

861
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.402
I wanna show you something

862
00:50:14.576 --> 00:50:15.708
and then I don't want to hear
another word.

863
00:50:15.882 --> 00:50:17.536
- Not another word.
- Don't touch me.

864
00:50:19.364 --> 00:50:21.366
I should've known you was off
putting more trash--

865
00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.671
Well. just look at it.
all right?

866
00:50:22.845 --> 00:50:24.717
- Just look at it.
- I done looked.

867
00:50:24.891 --> 00:50:26.153
Don't you know
who that is?

868
00:50:26.327 --> 00:50:27.763
Look! Don't you know
who that is?

869
00:50:27.937 --> 00:50:29.113
Who is it?
Ain't nobody I know.

870
00:50:29.287 --> 00:50:31.028
It's Him. all right?
It's-- It's Him!

871
00:50:31.202 --> 00:50:33.943
- Him who?
- Him! It's-- It's God.

872
00:50:34.118 --> 00:50:36.033
Just look at it
for a second.

873
00:50:36.207 --> 00:50:37.773
Just look. Huh?

874
00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:40.428
FLANNERY [Narrating]:
<i>He felt as though</i>

875
00:50:40.602 --> 00:50:42.256
<i>under her gaze.</i>

876
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:44.998
<i>he was as transparent
as the wing of a fly.</i>

877
00:50:45.172 --> 00:50:46.695
God?

878
00:50:46.869 --> 00:50:49.481
God don't look like that.

879
00:50:51.396 --> 00:50:53.615
What you mean?

880
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:55.139
How do you know? You don't know
what God look.

881
00:50:55.313 --> 00:50:57.097
You ain't never
seen him before.

882
00:50:57.271 --> 00:50:59.056
He don't look.
He's a spirit.

883
00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:00.709
No man shall see his face.

884
00:51:00.883 --> 00:51:02.233
Come on.
This is just a picture of him.

885
00:51:02.407 --> 00:51:03.886
No! Parker. no!

886
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:05.366
This is just a picture of him.

887
00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.586
No! No! That's idolatry.
Parker. Parker!

888
00:51:14.419 --> 00:51:18.075
Stop! Stop! Ah!

889
00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:22.079
Idolatry! Parker!

890
00:51:22.253 --> 00:51:24.124
Idolatry!

891
00:51:24.298 --> 00:51:25.299
<i>'Idolatry!'</i>

892
00:51:26.474 --> 00:51:27.562
<i>Sarah Ruth screamed.</i>

893
00:51:30.478 --> 00:51:32.480
<i>Still gripping the broom.</i>

894
00:51:32.654 --> 00:51:34.047
<i>she looked toward
the pecan tree</i>

895
00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:36.441
<i>and her eyes hardened
still more.</i>

896
00:51:36.615 --> 00:51:41.054
<i>There he was. who called
himself Obadiah Elihue...</i>

897
00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:43.970
<i>...crying like a baby.</i>

898
00:51:59.028 --> 00:52:01.118
- The thing I struggle with is--
- Hey. Walter...

899
00:52:04.382 --> 00:52:07.211
There won't be any critical
dissecting this afternoon.

900
00:52:08.951 --> 00:52:10.344
Workshop's over for the day.

901
00:52:39.982 --> 00:52:42.159
<i>Creativity is nature</i>

902
00:52:42.333 --> 00:52:44.465
<i>manifest in us.</i>

903
00:52:47.642 --> 00:52:49.905
<i>It is you inside us rising.</i>

904
00:52:54.432 --> 00:52:56.173
<i>Writing is dead
without you.</i>

905
00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:00.786
<i>Oh. Lord.
please rise in me.</i>

906
00:53:02.744 --> 00:53:04.833
<i>Make this dead
desire living.</i>

907
00:53:06.879 --> 00:53:09.490
<i>You are the slim crescent moon
that I see.</i>

908
00:53:09.664 --> 00:53:12.232
<i>and myself
is the earth's shadow</i>

909
00:53:12.406 --> 00:53:14.756
<i>that keeps me from seeing
all the moon.</i>

910
00:53:18.282 --> 00:53:20.022
<i>Help me feel</i>

911
00:53:20.197 --> 00:53:21.850
<i>that I will give up
every earthly thing for this.</i>

912
00:53:22.024 --> 00:53:23.852
...every earthly thing
for this.

913
00:53:24.026 --> 00:53:25.550
- I do not mean becoming a nun--
- Hey. Who are you talking to?

914
00:53:25.724 --> 00:53:26.899
Oh. God.

915
00:53:27.073 --> 00:53:28.553
Oh!

916
00:53:28.727 --> 00:53:32.339
- It's Cal. It's you.
- I didn't-- I'm sorry.

917
00:53:32.513 --> 00:53:34.211
No. I'm--

918
00:53:34.385 --> 00:53:36.213
I'm scared to death.

919
00:53:36.387 --> 00:53:37.866
I should be working.

920
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.565
You know.
I don't even like parties.

921
00:53:40.739 --> 00:53:42.349
I think whoever invented
the cocktail party

922
00:53:42.523 --> 00:53:45.874
ought to be drawn
and quartered.

923
00:53:46.048 --> 00:53:48.442
And I think my ankles
are soaked in Beefeater.

924
00:53:48.616 --> 00:53:50.575
Well. uh. I can get you
some vermouth.

925
00:53:50.749 --> 00:53:52.316
and they'll be--
they'll be perfect.

926
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:54.622
No. really. I-- I came to pay
my respects to you.

927
00:53:54.796 --> 00:53:57.973
and in some way
I've done that.

928
00:53:58.147 --> 00:53:59.323
And I think
I should go home.

929
00:53:59.497 --> 00:54:01.455
No. No. no. no. no.
no. no. no.

930
00:54:01.629 --> 00:54:04.806
Please stay. Please. Please
stay. Yeah.

931
00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:06.591
I won't be any good in there.
I need--

932
00:54:06.765 --> 00:54:08.288
I need your help.

933
00:54:08.462 --> 00:54:13.075
Uh. I'm finding this party
to be so-- so trying.

934
00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:15.252
If you are here.
I could be assured of

935
00:54:15.426 --> 00:54:19.908
at least one conversation
that isn't sordid

936
00:54:20.082 --> 00:54:23.042
or gossipy.

937
00:54:23.216 --> 00:54:26.393
or about some abstract
aesthetic theory.

938
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.702
Well. that's
high praise. Cal.

939
00:54:30.876 --> 00:54:32.181
It's true.

940
00:54:36.273 --> 00:54:37.752
You got any food
in there?

941
00:54:37.926 --> 00:54:39.580
Yes.

942
00:54:39.754 --> 00:54:42.061
Chicken a la king.

943
00:54:42.235 --> 00:54:44.063
Well. then maybe
for a minute then.

944
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.327
It's just that I hadn't eaten
all day.

945
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:51.462
Thank you.

946
00:54:57.424 --> 00:55:00.079
Your story...

947
00:55:00.253 --> 00:55:01.689
Parker's Back.

948
00:55:05.127 --> 00:55:06.303
...it's good.

949
00:55:09.044 --> 00:55:10.307
Thank you.

950
00:55:16.138 --> 00:55:17.139
I...

951
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:24.712
...canonize... you...

952
00:55:29.151 --> 00:55:31.980
...Saint Flannery.

953
00:55:42.513 --> 00:55:44.253
- Take a swig.
- Oh.

954
00:55:44.428 --> 00:55:46.212
Ah. there you are.

955
00:55:46.386 --> 00:55:49.824
Of course. your party
filled with adoring students.

956
00:55:49.998 --> 00:55:51.652
and you vanish.

957
00:55:51.826 --> 00:55:54.351
I don't even know
half of those people. Cal.

958
00:55:57.005 --> 00:56:00.966
Elizabeth. Flannery.
Flannery. Elizabeth.

959
00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:04.404
Hi. I-- I've read your book.
I liked it right much.

960
00:56:04.578 --> 00:56:06.319
I was very impressed.

961
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:10.192
Oh. thank you.

962
00:56:13.544 --> 00:56:16.982
Welcome to Cal's party.

963
00:56:18.244 --> 00:56:19.898
He's very important.

964
00:56:20.072 --> 00:56:21.726
He's won a Pulitzer.

965
00:56:24.642 --> 00:56:25.773
Uh...

966
00:56:29.821 --> 00:56:31.910
Come on.

967
00:56:32.084 --> 00:56:34.869
♪ What a rare
mood I'm in ♪

968
00:56:36.741 --> 00:56:41.528
♪ Why. it's almost like being
in love ♪

969
00:56:41.702 --> 00:56:43.269
When I was seven years old.

970
00:56:43.443 --> 00:56:44.966
my daddy and I had a chicken
that walked backwards.

971
00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:47.447
♪ There's a smile
on my face... ♪

972
00:56:47.621 --> 00:56:49.231
Pathé News came all the way
to Georgia

973
00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:51.408
to make a newsreel of it.

974
00:56:51.582 --> 00:56:53.584
I was in it. too.

975
00:56:53.758 --> 00:56:55.934
I was only there
to assist the chicken.

976
00:56:56.108 --> 00:56:58.415
but it was the high point
of my life.

977
00:56:58.589 --> 00:57:00.591
Everything since
has been anticlimax.

978
00:57:00.765 --> 00:57:02.506
Oh.

979
00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.159
Is she good?

980
00:57:04.333 --> 00:57:06.945
She's the most promising writer
in the class.

981
00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:11.036
Ouch. Walter. he said that
right in front of you.

982
00:57:14.256 --> 00:57:15.606
Congrats on winning
the Rinehart.

983
00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.477
- Oh. you won that?
- Oh. sorry.

984
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:19.871
- Definitely beating you now.
- Here.

985
00:57:20.045 --> 00:57:21.263
Thanks.

986
00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:23.701
Can I give you some advice
though?

987
00:57:23.875 --> 00:57:25.180
You should use
the word "Negro."

988
00:57:25.354 --> 00:57:27.008
- Ready?
- Instead of that other word.

989
00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:31.796
The people I'm writing about

990
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:33.275
would never dream of
using any other word.

991
00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:35.582
Just a friendly warning.

992
00:57:35.756 --> 00:57:37.584
And I prefer not
to tidy up reality.

993
00:57:37.758 --> 00:57:39.020
I'm not tidying up reality.

994
00:57:39.194 --> 00:57:40.674
What you're talking about
is propaganda.

995
00:57:40.848 --> 00:57:41.980
and propaganda even on the side
of the angels

996
00:57:42.154 --> 00:57:43.024
only makes it worse.

997
00:57:43.198 --> 00:57:44.461
The truth doesn't change

998
00:57:44.635 --> 00:57:45.984
according to your ability
to stomach it.

999
00:57:46.158 --> 00:57:47.115
Guys?

1000
00:57:49.074 --> 00:57:52.033
Hey. I was just trying
to be nice to you.

1001
00:58:01.956 --> 00:58:03.871
Well. I guess you're up.

1002
00:58:04.045 --> 00:58:05.046
Ready?

1003
00:58:06.526 --> 00:58:08.876
So. my question is.

1004
00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:11.052
do Christians.
do Catholics.

1005
00:58:11.226 --> 00:58:13.881
do whoever.
pick-- pick one.

1006
00:58:14.055 --> 00:58:17.102
believe that they're actually
eating Jesus?

1007
00:58:17.276 --> 00:58:18.320
Like cannibals.

1008
00:58:18.495 --> 00:58:19.496
Walter!

1009
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:21.410
I'm just saying.

1010
00:58:21.585 --> 00:58:24.892
And if so. then how can you
stand on a moral high ground?

1011
00:58:25.066 --> 00:58:29.157
Well. Walter. the question seems
to be. to me.

1012
00:58:29.331 --> 00:58:33.118
whether a person believes that
we are created in God's image.

1013
00:58:33.292 --> 00:58:36.121
or whether he believes that
we create God in our own.

1014
00:58:36.295 --> 00:58:37.644
Hmm?

1015
00:58:37.818 --> 00:58:39.428
Now. I don't know
the answer.

1016
00:58:39.603 --> 00:58:41.387
but I do remember.
as a child.

1017
00:58:41.561 --> 00:58:44.608
when I would stand in line
to receive the Host.

1018
00:58:44.782 --> 00:58:47.524
I always thought of it
as the Holy Ghost.

1019
00:58:47.698 --> 00:58:49.264
That's beautiful.

1020
00:58:49.438 --> 00:58:52.180
He seemed like the most portable
person of the Trinity.

1021
00:58:52.354 --> 00:58:54.748
Now. I think of the Eucharist

1022
00:58:54.922 --> 00:58:59.536
as a lovely.
expressive symbol...

1023
00:59:00.711 --> 00:59:02.277
The synecdoche of God.

1024
00:59:02.451 --> 00:59:04.366
If it's a symbol.
then to hell with it.

1025
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:10.111
Uh. it's a lot harder to believe
than not to believe.

1026
00:59:14.202 --> 00:59:16.988
What people don't understand

1027
00:59:17.162 --> 00:59:19.599
is how much religion costs.

1028
00:59:19.773 --> 00:59:24.343
They think that faith is a...
big electric blanket.

1029
00:59:24.517 --> 00:59:26.432
when really. it's the cross.

that a dog has its day.

1038
00:59:55.983 --> 00:59:59.683
and a cat has
a number of lives.

1039
00:59:59.857 --> 01:00:03.295
There are others who think
that a lobster is pink

1040
01:00:03.469 --> 01:00:07.560
and that bees
never work in their hives.

1041

- I didn't lie.
- You lied.

1047
01:00:38.504 --> 01:00:40.375
You have your truth.
I have mine.

1048
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:41.725
There is only one truth.

1049
01:00:41.899 --> 01:00:44.205
In that there is no truth.

1050
01:00:49.863 --> 01:00:51.691
All my thoughts are
so far away from God.

1051
01:00:51.865 --> 01:00:53.606
He may as well
not have made me.

1070
01:02:58.426 --> 01:03:00.559

1071
01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:05.303

<i>Let me be
your typewriter.</i>

1074
01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:23.321
We only live once.

1075
01:03:23.495 --> 01:03:26.672
And by-- by paying
just a little bit more for it.

1076
01:03:26.846 --> 01:03:29.240
I. at least. I won't meet myself
coming and going.

1077
01:03:30.719 --> 01:03:31.982
I mean. this hat
looked much better on me

1078
01:03:32.156 --> 01:03:33.331
than any of the others.

1079
01:03:33.505 --> 01:03:35.072
And when I bought it. I said.

1080
01:03:35.246 --> 01:03:37.509
"Take this thing back.
I won't have it on my head."

1081
01:03:37.683 --> 01:03:40.773
And the lady person said.
"Now. wait till you try it on."

1082
01:03:40.947 --> 01:03:42.514
So I did.

1083
01:03:42.688 --> 01:03:46.605
and she said. "Now.
you do something for that hat.

1084
01:03:46.779 --> 01:03:49.608
and that hat.
it does something for you."

1085
01:03:49.782 --> 01:03:51.175
She said.
"With that hat.

1086
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:53.220
you won't miss yourself
coming and going."

1087
01:03:54.526 --> 01:03:56.180
I like it. Mother.

1088
01:03:58.399 --> 01:04:00.184
With the way the world is.

1089
01:04:00.358 --> 01:04:02.142
it's a wonder
we can enjoy anything.

1090
01:04:03.274 --> 01:04:04.753
I tell you.
the bottom rail is on top.

1091
01:04:04.928 --> 01:04:06.494
Let's skip it.

1092
01:04:06.668 --> 01:04:09.933
You know. I remember this
old darky who was my nurse.

1093
01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:12.196
Caroline. there was no better
person in the world.

1094
01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:14.589
For God's sakes. Mother.
please come off the subject.

1095
01:04:22.293 --> 01:04:24.861
Why must you always dress
like this when we go into town?

1096
01:04:25.035 --> 01:04:26.253
You look like a gangster.

1097
01:04:26.427 --> 01:04:27.864
Nobody cares
what I look like.

1098
01:04:28.038 --> 01:04:29.691
I care.

1099
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:35.219
I can be gracious to anybody.
I know who I am.

1100
01:04:35.393 --> 01:04:37.351
Nobody gives a damn about
your graciousness.

1101
01:04:37.525 --> 01:04:39.484
and you haven't the foggiest
idea of who you are.

1102
01:04:39.658 --> 01:04:41.878
I most certainly do know
who I am.

1103
01:04:42.052 --> 01:04:43.880
and if you don't.
I'm ashamed of you.

1104
01:04:44.054 --> 01:04:45.577
Oh. hell.

1105
01:04:50.538 --> 01:04:52.149
Your grandfather

1106
01:04:52.323 --> 01:04:54.107
was the former governor
of this state.

1107
01:04:54.281 --> 01:04:56.544
Your grandmother
was a Godhigh.

1108
01:04:56.718 --> 01:04:58.546
And your great-grandfather.

1109
01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.288
he owned a plantation
and 200 slaves.

1110
01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:07.686
Luckily. people are not allowed
to be bought and sold anymore.

1111
01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.557
Except when they dress it up
like a wedding.

1112
01:05:09.731 --> 01:05:13.126
Hmm. What would you know
about a wedding?

1113
01:05:17.435 --> 01:05:18.958
Colby. come on. baby.

1114
01:05:23.267 --> 01:05:25.138
Be still. be still.
Come on.

1115
01:06:10.705 --> 01:06:12.969
Ooh. isn't he cute?

1116
01:06:22.108 --> 01:06:24.023
Peek-a-boo.

1117
01:06:24.197 --> 01:06:27.722
Oh. I think he likes me.

1118
01:06:27.896 --> 01:06:29.594
Stop all this mess.

1119
01:06:29.768 --> 01:06:31.770
Quit this foolishness.
sit up straight.

1120
01:06:31.944 --> 01:06:33.815
Sit up straight. Sit up.

1121
01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:46.741
I want to give
that boy a nickel.

1122
01:06:46.915 --> 01:06:48.178
No.
- Uh-huh.

1123
01:06:48.352 --> 01:06:49.962
Mother. Mother.
he won't like it.

1124
01:06:50.136 --> 01:06:51.790
Oh. I can't find nothing
but a penny.

1125
01:06:51.964 --> 01:06:53.313
Don't do that.

1126
01:06:53.487 --> 01:06:55.011
Oh. but it looks like
shiny new.

1127
01:06:55.185 --> 01:06:56.447
Put your purse away--
Little boy?

1128
01:06:56.621 --> 01:06:57.883
Hey-hey. woo-hoo!

1129
01:06:58.057 --> 01:07:02.105
Little boy. look.
I got a bright new penny.

1130
01:07:02.279 --> 01:07:06.805
I got a nice shiny penny
just for you.

1131
01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:10.548
Uh-huh. Ooh. got it?
There you go.

1132
01:07:10.722 --> 01:07:12.941
He don't take...
nobody's pennies!

1133
01:07:13.116 --> 01:07:15.161
Nobody's.

1134
01:07:19.861 --> 01:07:20.906
This...

1135
01:07:45.452 --> 01:07:48.325
That's why I told you
not to do that.

1136
01:07:49.674 --> 01:07:51.415
In the future.
please spare me

1137
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:54.635
any more moral lectures
on the race problem.

1138
01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:58.857
I-- I will no longer allow you
to confine my friendships

1139
01:07:59.031 --> 01:08:00.032
based on matters of race.

1140
01:08:00.206 --> 01:08:01.903
I want to go home.

1141
01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:03.992
Oh. what? You think that was
just one uppity Negro woman?

1142
01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:05.516
It wasn't.

1143
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:08.040
That was all colored people
telling you that

1144
01:08:08.214 --> 01:08:10.260
they won't take your
condescending pennies anymore.

1145
01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:15.091
Don't act like it's the end
of the world. 'cause it ain't.

1146
01:08:15.265 --> 01:08:17.223
We are going to
your reducing class

1147
01:08:17.397 --> 01:08:18.659
'cause you are fat.

1148
01:08:18.833 --> 01:08:20.661
Fat. Mama!

1149
01:08:20.835 --> 01:08:22.446
I need to go.

1150
01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:25.449
- Mama. come on!
- I wanna go home.

1151
01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:31.194
Mother.
where are you going?

1152
01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:37.156
Mother.
I'm not walking any further.

1153
01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:39.637
Going home.

1154
01:08:39.811 --> 01:08:41.247
Mother!

1155
01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:46.252
Tell Grandpa
to come get me!

1156
01:08:50.213 --> 01:08:51.605
Tell--

1157
01:08:51.779 --> 01:08:53.999
Tell Caroline.

1158
01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:58.395
Tell Caroline
to come get me.

1159
01:09:06.838 --> 01:09:08.274
What?

1160
01:09:08.448 --> 01:09:11.582
Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama.

1161
01:09:11.756 --> 01:09:13.540
Mama. I'm sorry.

1162
01:09:13.714 --> 01:09:15.194
I'm sorry.
I'll take you home.

1163
01:09:15.368 --> 01:09:17.370
Mama. I'll take you.

1164
01:09:17.544 --> 01:09:21.113
Mama. Mama. I'm sorry.

1165
01:09:23.507 --> 01:09:24.638
Help me!

1166
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:34.953
Well?

1167
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:38.304
Uh. well...

1168
01:09:45.398 --> 01:09:46.573
I--

1169
01:09:46.747 --> 01:09:48.793
I don't understand...

1170
01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:52.840
...why you don't wanna write something

1171
01:09:53.014 --> 01:09:55.234
that people
would like to read.

1172
01:09:57.845 --> 01:10:01.153
I mean. it's not exactly
Harper's BAZAAR now. is it?

1173
01:10:02.459 --> 01:10:03.895
Harper's BAZAAR?

1174
01:10:04.069 --> 01:10:05.636
But do--

1175
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:10.118
Do you really think you're using
the talent God gave you.

1176
01:10:10.293 --> 01:10:13.339
if you don't write something
that a lot--

1177
01:10:13.513 --> 01:10:15.341
a lot of people like?

1178
01:10:17.125 --> 01:10:19.084
That is a literary magazine.

1179
01:10:21.347 --> 01:10:22.870
Do they pay?

1180
01:10:23.044 --> 01:10:24.916
Yes. they pay.

1181
01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:27.614
They don't pay a lot.

1182
01:10:27.788 --> 01:10:29.181
But those are
the kinds of magazines

1183
01:10:29.355 --> 01:10:31.836
that help establish
a writer's reputation.

1184
01:10:33.098 --> 01:10:35.796
Well. reputations
don't buy groceries.

1185
01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:40.540
I'm thinking of ordering me
a peacock.

1186
01:10:41.889 --> 01:10:44.283
- A peacock?
- Mm.

1187
01:10:45.371 --> 01:10:47.373
Don't those things
eat flowers?

1188
01:10:47.547 --> 01:10:49.506
No. they eat Startena.
like the rest of 'em.

1189
01:10:50.855 --> 01:10:52.160
I-- I don't know.

1190
01:10:53.161 --> 01:10:54.641
I'll need a new hobby

1191
01:10:54.815 --> 01:10:56.295
if I'm gonna be
a decoration around here.

1192
01:11:04.999 --> 01:11:07.263
You know.

1193
01:11:07.437 --> 01:11:10.570
you might want to consider being
a little more friendly.

1194
01:11:13.704 --> 01:11:15.575
I'm not gonna
let you die.

1195
01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:20.667
Hmm?

1196
01:11:47.825 --> 01:11:50.567
<i>Dear Cal. I'm making out fine.</i>

1197
01:11:50.741 --> 01:11:53.874
<i>in spite of
any conflicting stories.</i>

1198
01:11:54.048 --> 01:11:56.181
<i>Me and the novel are stuck in
the Georgia wilderness</i>

1199
01:11:56.355 --> 01:11:58.488
<i>at my bird sanctuary
for a few months.</i>

1200
01:11:58.662 --> 01:12:00.533
<i>waiting to see
how much of an invalid</i>

1201
01:12:00.707 --> 01:12:02.622
<i>I'm going to get to be.</i>

1202
01:12:04.276 --> 01:12:06.626
<i>In a sense. sickness is
a place more instructive</i>

1203
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.585
<i>than a long trip to Europe.</i>

1204
01:12:11.065 --> 01:12:12.458
<i>I'm writing and revising
the novel.</i>

1205
01:12:12.632 --> 01:12:14.025
<i>but it's so bad
at present</i>

1206
01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:15.592
<i>that I'm writing
a lot of short stories</i>

1207
01:12:15.766 --> 01:12:17.376
<i>as to not have
to look at it.</i>

1208
01:12:18.899 --> 01:12:21.075
<i>I'm getting up a collection
that I plan on calling</i>

1209
01:12:21.249 --> 01:12:23.817
A Good Man Is Hard to Find.

1210
01:12:26.124 --> 01:12:28.213
<i>If you make any trips.</i>

1211
01:12:28.387 --> 01:12:30.563
<i>I hope you will include Milledgeville.</i>

1212
01:12:49.147 --> 01:12:50.714
Learning to walk
on these crutches.

1213
01:12:50.888 --> 01:12:52.716
I feel like a large.
stiff. anthropoid ape

1214
01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:56.110
who has no cause to be thinking
about St. Thomas or Aristotle

1215
01:12:56.284 --> 01:12:57.938
and instead should be thinking
about bananas.

1216
01:12:58.112 --> 01:12:59.897
Oh. baby.

1217
01:13:00.071 --> 01:13:03.988
You'll be walking on 'em
just as good as new in no time.

1218
01:13:04.162 --> 01:13:05.685
You'll get used to 'em.

1219
01:13:05.859 --> 01:13:08.862
Hey. did I ever tell you
about that time

1220
01:13:09.036 --> 01:13:11.082
that my little pony. Patina.

1221
01:13:11.256 --> 01:13:12.779
reared up and hit me
in the head?

1222
01:13:12.953 --> 01:13:14.564
- Did I ever tell you that?
- Maybe once or twice.

1223
01:13:14.738 --> 01:13:16.479
Well. I was out lunging her--
oh. okay.

1224
01:13:16.653 --> 01:13:17.828
I was out lunging
her one day...

1225
01:13:18.002 --> 01:13:18.959
<i>Lord. I do not want</i>

1226
01:13:19.133 --> 01:13:20.874
<i>to be lonely all my life.</i>

1227
01:13:21.048 --> 01:13:22.615
...Well. she'd had enough of it.
Just had...

1228
01:13:22.789 --> 01:13:24.182
<i>People only make me lonelier</i>

1229
01:13:24.356 --> 01:13:25.879
<i>by reminding me of you.</i>

1230
01:13:26.053 --> 01:13:28.534
...reared up on me.
smacked me in the forehead.

1231
01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:32.886
left a hoof print on my forehead
for 37 days.

1232
01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.627
You should have seen
your grandmother.

1233
01:13:34.801 --> 01:13:36.455
She came flying out of
the kitchen door.

1234
01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:39.719
"That pony's gonna kill you.
That pony's gonna kill you."

1235
01:13:41.808 --> 01:13:44.115
<i>I'm reading Mr. Kafka.</i>

1236
01:13:44.289 --> 01:13:47.292
<i>and I'm understanding more
about his problem of grace.</i>

1237
01:13:50.338 --> 01:13:52.079
<i>God's love
is always available.</i>

1238
01:13:54.125 --> 01:13:57.258
<i>And the more we suffer.
the closer you come.</i>

1239
01:14:01.567 --> 01:14:05.441
<i>But it is still so difficult
to want to suffer.</i>

1240
01:14:11.098 --> 01:14:13.231
<i>Lord. please grant
me grace...</i>

1241
01:14:15.842 --> 01:14:16.930
<i>...and please.
if possible...</i>

1242
01:14:19.063 --> 01:14:21.848
<i>...don't make it as painful
as it was for Mr. Kafka.</i>

1243
01:14:34.644 --> 01:14:35.688
Oh. my God. Mary Flannery!

1244
01:14:35.862 --> 01:14:38.604
Oh. my God. No. Do not move.

1245
01:14:38.778 --> 01:14:40.867
Do not--
I'm calling the doctor.

1246
01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:43.174
I'm not climbing
those stairs anymore.

1247
01:14:58.406 --> 01:15:02.193
Mary Flannery?
Mary Flannery?

1248
01:15:02.367 --> 01:15:04.804
Ah. there she is.

1249
01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:08.242
Forgive me
for waking you up.

1250
01:15:09.766 --> 01:15:10.767
Father Flynn?

1251
01:15:12.812 --> 01:15:14.771
Are you... are you here
to give me Extreme Unction?

1252
01:15:14.945 --> 01:15:16.555
No. no. no.

1253
01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:19.036
Regina requested a visitation.

1254
01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:21.168
Oh.
Thank you.

1255
01:15:24.694 --> 01:15:27.087
Regina. I'd like to speak
to the father alone. please.

1256
01:15:46.324 --> 01:15:47.499
Thank you for coming.

1257
01:15:47.673 --> 01:15:49.849
Happy to do it.
Happy to do it.

1258
01:15:50.023 --> 01:15:51.111
How do you feel?

1259
01:15:51.285 --> 01:15:53.636
I feel awful.

1260
01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:56.943
The cortisone shots make me
think night and day. and then.

1261
01:15:57.117 --> 01:15:58.945
the blood transfusions
knock me out again.

1262
01:15:59.119 --> 01:16:01.121
- Cortisone?
- I feel awful.

1263
01:16:01.295 --> 01:16:02.949
I feel like I got no blood.

1264
01:16:04.472 --> 01:16:06.518
Ah. you've got enough
for a Southern girl.

1265
01:16:06.692 --> 01:16:09.347
Confession and communion
will sort you out.

1266
01:16:11.523 --> 01:16:14.874
Father. I'm afraid.

1267
01:16:17.181 --> 01:16:18.312
Afraid of what?

1268
01:16:20.488 --> 01:16:22.012
You'll be the pallbearer
at my funeral

1269
01:16:22.186 --> 01:16:23.970
like you were for my father.

1270
01:16:24.144 --> 01:16:26.320
or worse. I'll be stuck here
for the rest of my life.

1271
01:16:26.494 --> 01:16:30.063
I wasn't a pallbearer.
I conducted the mass.

1272
01:16:30.237 --> 01:16:32.283
I'm sorry. Father.
I thought...

1273
01:16:34.546 --> 01:16:39.420
Now. I want you to read these.
That'll sort you out.

1274
01:16:44.948 --> 01:16:46.776
"Preserve the Lily
of Innocence."

1275
01:16:48.734 --> 01:16:50.518
Have you read Joyce?

1276
01:16:50.693 --> 01:16:54.131
- Who?
- James Joyce.

1277
01:16:54.305 --> 01:16:56.133
Haven't met him.

1278
01:16:56.307 --> 01:16:57.264
No. he's a great writer.

1279
01:16:57.438 --> 01:16:59.049
It-- him.

1280
01:16:59.223 --> 01:17:02.400
Yes. he's banned in Ireland.
of course.

1281
01:17:06.534 --> 01:17:08.754
Are you a--
a writer. yourself?

1282
01:17:12.323 --> 01:17:13.933
I want to be.

1283
01:17:15.718 --> 01:17:19.896
Well. you'll never learn to be
good at anything without prayer.

1284
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:22.986
You can't love Jesus
if you don't talk to him.

1285
01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.465
I do talk to him.

1286
01:17:26.554 --> 01:17:27.860
I try every day.

1287
01:17:29.819 --> 01:17:31.037
I say. "Oh. God. please."

1288
01:17:31.211 --> 01:17:32.822
and "I must." and
"please. please."

1289
01:17:32.996 --> 01:17:35.912
But I don't know him.
because I'm in the way.

1290
01:17:37.522 --> 01:17:41.221
I long for grace.
I see it.

1291
01:17:41.395 --> 01:17:45.051
I know it's there.
but I can't touch it.

1292
01:17:45.225 --> 01:17:48.054
My faith rises
and falls in me

1293
01:17:48.228 --> 01:17:50.013
like the tide of
an invisible sea.

1294
01:17:50.187 --> 01:17:51.841
It's torment.

1295
01:17:52.015 --> 01:17:54.670
But then I think
that might be the process

1296
01:17:54.844 --> 01:17:57.281
by which faith
can be deepened.

1297
01:17:57.455 --> 01:17:59.413
Maybe God finds us
in the darkness

1298
01:17:59.587 --> 01:18:01.459
and not in the light.

1299
01:18:01.633 --> 01:18:03.287
Maybe faith is a little more
like marriage.

1300
01:18:03.461 --> 01:18:05.028
that when you get into it.
you find it is the beginning

1301
01:18:05.202 --> 01:18:06.551
and not the end
of how to make love work.

1302
01:18:06.725 --> 01:18:09.293
But I don't know anything
about marriage.

1303
01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:12.557
I spend my days
injecting myself

1304
01:18:12.731 --> 01:18:14.820
with the pituitary glands
of poor. slaughtered pigs.

1305
01:18:14.994 --> 01:18:18.650
And I do know

1306
01:18:18.824 --> 01:18:22.088
that mystery isn't
gradually evaporating.

1307
01:18:22.262 --> 01:18:24.221
It grows with more knowledge.

1308
01:18:25.483 --> 01:18:27.267
Right?

1309
01:18:27.441 --> 01:18:30.227
Today's Christians.
like my mother. for example.

1310
01:18:30.401 --> 01:18:32.838
operate by the slide rule.

1311
01:18:33.012 --> 01:18:35.319
And the church for them is
a poor man's insurance company.

1312
01:18:35.493 --> 01:18:36.581
the Elks Club.

1313
01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:40.672
But I don't want it
to be fear

1314
01:18:40.846 --> 01:18:42.282
which keeps me
in the church.

1315
01:18:42.456 --> 01:18:43.762
I don't want to be a coward.

1316
01:18:43.936 --> 01:18:45.503
staying with Him
because I fear hell.

1317
01:18:45.677 --> 01:18:46.983
Though hell seems
a great deal more feasible

1318
01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:48.811
than my weak mind in heaven.

1319
01:18:48.985 --> 01:18:53.293
No doubt because hell is a more
earthly-seeming thing.

1320
01:18:53.467 --> 01:18:54.642
If we could
accurately map heaven.

1321
01:18:54.817 --> 01:18:56.514
some of our
up-and-coming scientists

1322
01:18:56.688 --> 01:18:58.472
would begin drawing blueprints
for its improvement.

1323
01:18:58.646 --> 01:19:00.605
and the bourgeois would sell
guides ten cents a copy

1324
01:19:00.779 --> 01:19:02.259
to all over 65.

1325
01:19:04.696 --> 01:19:06.306
I don't mean to be clever.

1326
01:19:10.049 --> 01:19:13.313
Although I do mean
to be clever.

1327
01:19:13.487 --> 01:19:15.925
And I want you to think so.

1328
01:19:16.099 --> 01:19:18.579
What I pray for
is ridiculous.

1329
01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:20.277
My demands are absurd.

1330
01:19:20.451 --> 01:19:23.410
I want to be a mystic.
but I am cheese.

1331
01:19:23.584 --> 01:19:25.543
I am the moth
who would be king.

1332
01:19:25.717 --> 01:19:27.458
Shh. shh. shh.

1333
01:19:35.335 --> 01:19:36.902
Amen.

1334
01:19:39.035 --> 01:19:42.429
You don't need to see grace.
It's always here.

1335
01:19:44.214 --> 01:19:47.913
You resist it
because grace changes us.

1336
01:19:48.087 --> 01:19:50.437
and change is bloody painful.

1337
01:19:51.874 --> 01:19:55.486
This notion
that grace is healing

1338
01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.532
omits that. before it heals.

1339
01:19:58.706 --> 01:20:00.099
it cuts with a sword

1340
01:20:00.273 --> 01:20:02.493
that Christ said
He came to bring.

1341
01:20:06.366 --> 01:20:08.499
The way to gladness
begins with a hard blow.

1342
01:20:09.979 --> 01:20:13.199
Joy is sorrow overcome.

1343
01:20:18.639 --> 01:20:20.772
- Father?
- Yes?

1344
01:20:20.946 --> 01:20:22.643
How can I be a good Catholic?

1345
01:20:27.605 --> 01:20:31.478
Give alms. Mary Flannery.
Serve others.

1346
01:20:31.652 --> 01:20:35.439
A full heart.
enriched by honest service.

1347
01:20:35.613 --> 01:20:38.877
love. sacrifice.
and courage.

1348
01:20:42.141 --> 01:20:44.491
You mean like charity.

1349
01:20:44.665 --> 01:20:47.799
I fear the only thing I'll ever
be able to do is write.

1350
01:20:47.973 --> 01:20:51.368
- Then write.
- But my writing is scandalous.

1351
01:20:53.239 --> 01:20:55.241
Can it still serve God?

1352
01:20:55.415 --> 01:20:57.678
People are always
imagining themselves

1353
01:20:57.853 --> 01:20:59.855
to be scandalized
by one thing or another.

1354
01:21:01.595 --> 01:21:03.815
Banning choice
is your disease.

1355
01:21:06.078 --> 01:21:08.341
Is your writing honest?
Is your conscience clear?

1356
01:21:10.343 --> 01:21:12.171
Then the rest
is God's business.

1357
01:21:15.174 --> 01:21:17.785
In the end.
it's all straw.

1358
01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.443
I suppose I can
take being sick

1359
01:21:23.617 --> 01:21:26.316
if I have the strength
to write a little each day.

1360
01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:27.491
Hm.

1361
01:21:29.797 --> 01:21:34.759
With God's help. you can even
see it all as a blessing.

1362
01:21:37.718 --> 01:21:42.375
Now. should we try
at a proper confession?

1363
01:21:42.549 --> 01:21:43.550
Hmm?

1364
01:21:55.954 --> 01:21:57.086
Oh. y'all should see

1365
01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:00.176
our new preacher
singing his sermon.

1366
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:02.613
He puts a chair out
on the platform.

1367
01:22:02.787 --> 01:22:04.963
and he'll call out
for some biblical character

1368
01:22:05.137 --> 01:22:07.313
to come up and testify.

1369
01:22:07.487 --> 01:22:09.098
Mm-hm.

1370
01:22:09.272 --> 01:22:11.317
I'm gonna go
start on those bulbs

1371
01:22:11.491 --> 01:22:13.972
and check on Carramae.

1372
01:22:14.146 --> 01:22:17.062
She's thrown up
four times after supper.

1373
01:22:17.236 --> 01:22:18.324
<i>The Idiot?</i>

1374
01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:24.548
You would get something
called <i>Idiot.</i>

1375
01:22:24.722 --> 01:22:26.898
What's it about?

1376
01:22:27.072 --> 01:22:28.378
An idiot.

1377
01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:33.731
Mrs. Cedars?

1378
01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:38.649
Mrs. Cedars?

1379
01:22:41.478 --> 01:22:43.349
Good morning.
Mrs. Cedars.

1380
01:22:43.523 --> 01:22:45.699
I'm Mrs. Hopewell.

1381
01:22:45.873 --> 01:22:47.397
Oh!
I-- I--

1382
01:22:47.571 --> 01:22:49.442
Well. I saw it said
The Cedars on the mailbox.

1383
01:22:49.616 --> 01:22:51.357
so I thought you
was Mrs. Cedars.

1384
01:22:51.531 --> 01:22:52.968
- Hm.
- Mrs. Hopewell.

1385
01:22:53.142 --> 01:22:54.970
I hope you are well.

1386
01:22:55.144 --> 01:22:56.536
<i>I've come to speak to
you of serious things.</i>

1387
01:22:56.710 --> 01:22:58.495
Lady. I've come
to speak of serious things.

1388
01:23:05.197 --> 01:23:06.938
How may I help you?

1389
01:23:07.112 --> 01:23:08.940
Mrs. Hopewell. you believe
in the Christian service?

1390
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:12.639
Oh. yes.

1391
01:23:12.813 --> 01:23:14.554
And you're a good woman.

1392
01:23:14.728 --> 01:23:15.991
- Friends have told me.
- Mm.

1393
01:23:16.165 --> 01:23:17.122
<i>What are you selling?</i>

1394
01:23:17.296 --> 01:23:18.863
What are you selling?

1395
01:23:19.037 --> 01:23:20.082
Bibles.

1396
01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:24.477
And you have
a beautiful home.

1397
01:23:24.651 --> 01:23:28.090
But I see you have no family
bible in your parlor.

1398
01:23:28.264 --> 01:23:29.656
"Well. you might as well
put those bibles up.

1399
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:30.831
"I don't want any."

1400
01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:32.572
I don't want to buy a bible.

1401
01:23:32.746 --> 01:23:35.140
and-- and I smell
my dinner burning.

1402
01:23:35.314 --> 01:23:36.968
Well. lady.
I'll tell you the truth.

1403
01:23:37.142 --> 01:23:38.622
I'm just a country boy.

1404
01:23:38.796 --> 01:23:41.016
Oh. well.
I think good country people

1405
01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:43.235
are the salt of the earth.

1406
01:23:43.409 --> 01:23:45.194
Well. I think there
aren't enough

1407
01:23:45.368 --> 01:23:47.239
good country people
in the world.

1408
01:23:47.413 --> 01:23:50.068
It-- that's what I think's
wrong with it.

1409
01:23:53.245 --> 01:23:54.942
I didn't introduce myself.

1410
01:24:00.731 --> 01:24:04.822
I'm Manley Pointer. from out in
the country around Willohobie.

1411
01:24:04.996 --> 01:24:07.651
Not even from a place.
just from near a place.

1412
01:24:10.958 --> 01:24:12.395
I need to see to my dinner.

1413
01:24:12.569 --> 01:24:13.787
Of course.

1414
01:24:17.878 --> 01:24:20.142
Get rid of the salt of the earth
and let's eat.

1415
01:24:21.752 --> 01:24:24.276
I can't be rude to anybody.

1416
01:24:38.682 --> 01:24:43.426
I heard some farms are breeding
chickens without wings.

1417
01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.341
That way we get
more white meat.

1418
01:24:45.515 --> 01:24:46.907
Mm.

1419
01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:48.735
It's a whole society
of wingless chickens.

1420
01:24:48.909 --> 01:24:50.737
That's why Nietzsche says
God is dead.

1421
01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:55.873
- Joy. here. is a writer.
- Mm.

1422
01:24:56.047 --> 01:24:58.745
Yeah. She spends all day long
up in her room writing.

1423
01:24:58.919 --> 01:25:01.226
- Mm.
- Lord knows what.

1424
01:25:05.404 --> 01:25:09.539
She looks like a writer.
It must come easy for you.

1425
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:13.456
It's like giving birth
to a piano sideways.

1426
01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:21.812
FLANNERY [Narrating]:
<i>Bible salesman</i>

1427
01:25:21.986 --> 01:25:23.553
<i>with a bad heart.</i>

1428
01:25:23.727 --> 01:25:25.076
<i>Strange. I could seduce him
quite easily.</i>

1429
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:27.122
but then I'd have to reckon
with his remorse.

1430
01:25:45.314 --> 01:25:47.011
You ever ate a chicken
that was two days old?

1431
01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.146
Yes.

1432
01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:54.497
It must have been mighty small!

1433
01:26:00.416 --> 01:26:04.289
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

1434
01:26:12.254 --> 01:26:13.342
I see you got a wooden leg.

1435
01:26:17.433 --> 01:26:18.695
What's your name?

1436
01:26:18.869 --> 01:26:20.131
Hulga.

1437
01:26:20.305 --> 01:26:23.613
Hulga.
Hulga.

1438
01:26:23.787 --> 01:26:25.092
Hulga.

1439
01:26:27.878 --> 01:26:30.359
I ain't never heard of
anybody named Hulga before.

1440
01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:34.624
My mama named me Joy.

1441
01:26:34.798 --> 01:26:37.540
I changed it to Hulga
when I went away to school.

1442

was regarding him</i>

1444
01:26:43.894 --> 01:26:47.550
<i>from a great distance
with amusement. with pity.</i>

1445
01:26:51.162 --> 01:26:52.729
I like girls
that wear glasses.

1446
01:26:54.339 --> 01:26:55.601
I think a lot.

1447
01:26:57.299 --> 01:26:59.039
I'm not like one of these people
that serious thoughts

1448
01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:01.520
don't ever enter their heads.

1449
01:27:01.694 --> 01:27:03.043
Because I may die. Hulga.

1450
01:27:04.654 --> 01:27:06.743
You and I have
the same condition.

1451
01:27:07.787 --> 01:27:09.267
I may die too.

1452
01:27:12.792 --> 01:27:15.273
Listen. don't you think some
people are just meant to meet

1453
01:27:15.447 --> 01:27:17.754
on account of what they got
in common and all?

1454
01:27:19.495 --> 01:27:21.279
Like they both think
serious thoughts and all?

1455
01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:26.284
I don't work Saturday.

1456
01:27:26.458 --> 01:27:28.330
Couldn't we go on a picnic?

1457
01:27:28.504 --> 01:27:30.854
Say yes. Hulga.
Say yes.

1458
01:27:32.464 --> 01:27:33.683
Please?

1459
01:27:36.686 --> 01:27:37.991
<i>She decided</i>

1460
01:27:38.165 --> 01:27:39.689
<i>for the first time
in her life.</i>

1461
01:27:39.863 --> 01:27:41.908
<i>she was face to face
with real innocence.</i>

1462
01:27:45.695 --> 01:27:47.740
I guess God
takes care of you.

1463
01:27:47.914 --> 01:27:49.612
No. I don't believe in God.

1464
01:27:54.181 --> 01:27:55.270
No?

1465
01:27:57.315 --> 01:27:59.317
That's very unusual
for a girl.

1466
01:28:15.812 --> 01:28:17.204
<i>She had never
been kissed before</i>

1467
01:28:17.379 --> 01:28:18.858
<i>and she was pleased
to discover</i>

1468
01:28:19.032 --> 01:28:20.686
<i>that it was
an unexceptional experience.</i>

1469
01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:23.602
<i>and all a matter
of the mind's control.</i>

1470
01:28:23.776 --> 01:28:25.082
<i>Some people
might enjoy drain water</i>

1471
01:28:25.256 --> 01:28:27.650
<i>if they were told
it was vodka.</i>

1472
01:28:39.966 --> 01:28:41.533
Well. come on if you're coming!

1473
01:28:41.707 --> 01:28:44.057
Okay. I'm coming.

1474
01:28:44.231 --> 01:28:45.450
I love you.

1475
01:28:48.105 --> 01:28:50.455
I love you.

1476
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:52.327
I said it.
now. you gotta say it.

1477
01:28:53.632 --> 01:28:56.026
I don't have illusions.

1478
01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:59.812
I'm one of those people
who see through to nothing.

1479
01:29:01.161 --> 01:29:02.511
Okay. okay. okay.

1480
01:29:02.685 --> 01:29:04.208
Okay. but do you love me
or don't you?

1481
01:29:04.382 --> 01:29:06.776
You poor baby.
I mean...

1482
01:29:09.256 --> 01:29:11.737
...makes sense
you don't understand.

1483
01:29:11.911 --> 01:29:15.001
We are all damned.

1484
01:29:15.175 --> 01:29:19.571
But some of us
have taken off our blindfolds

1485
01:29:19.745 --> 01:29:24.359
and see that
there is nothing to see.

1486
01:29:26.099 --> 01:29:27.666
It's a kind of salvation.

1487
01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:32.454
Okay. okay. okay. but do you
love me or don't you?

1488
01:29:33.585 --> 01:29:35.892
I'm a great deal
older than you.

1489
01:29:36.066 --> 01:29:37.807
and I have
a number of degrees.

1490
01:29:41.332 --> 01:29:42.855
I don't care.

1491
01:29:43.029 --> 01:29:44.596
I don't care a thing
about all you've done.

1492
01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:47.077
I just want to know
if you love me or don't you.

1493
01:29:48.644 --> 01:29:51.124
Yes.

1494
01:29:58.523 --> 01:30:02.266
Okay. okay. okay.
then prove it.

1495
01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.441
Okay.

1496
01:30:04.747 --> 01:30:06.052
Show me where
your wooden leg joins on.

1497
01:30:06.226 --> 01:30:07.532
No.

1498
01:30:07.706 --> 01:30:09.142
Show me where
your wooden leg joins on.

1499
01:30:09.316 --> 01:30:10.840
No.

1500
01:30:11.014 --> 01:30:12.450
FLANNERY [Narrating]:
<i>She was as sensitive</i>

1501
01:30:12.624 --> 01:30:14.104
<i>about her leg as a peacock
about his tail.</i>

1502
01:30:14.278 --> 01:30:16.106
<i>No one ever
touched it but her.</i>

1503
01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:19.326
<i>She took care of it as someone
else would his soul.</i>

1504
01:30:30.294 --> 01:30:32.165
All right.

1505
01:30:48.921 --> 01:30:50.227
FLANNERY [Narrating]:
<i>She was thinking</i>

1506
01:30:50.401 --> 01:30:52.447
<i>that she would run away
with him.</i>

1507
01:30:52.621 --> 01:30:56.538
<i>And that every night.
he would take the leg off.</i>

1508
01:30:56.712 --> 01:30:58.409
<i>and every morning
put it back on again.</i>

1509
01:31:08.637 --> 01:31:10.639
Now. will you let me show you
how to put it back on?

1510
01:31:10.813 --> 01:31:12.597
Oh. come on. now.
You got me instead.

1511
01:31:14.338 --> 01:31:16.296
- Just give me my leg.
- Wait.

1512
01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:18.342
Wait. wait. wait. wait.

1513
01:31:33.836 --> 01:31:34.837
Take a swig.

1514
01:31:35.011 --> 01:31:37.274
Um. uh...

1515
01:31:39.102 --> 01:31:41.408
I thought you were
just good country people.

1516
01:31:41.583 --> 01:31:43.846
Yeah. but it
ain't held me back none.

1517
01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:45.325
Come on. now.

1518
01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.545
I'm as good as you
any day in the week.

1519
01:31:47.719 --> 01:31:49.329
I know.

1520
01:31:49.504 --> 01:31:50.722
So give me my leg.

1521
01:31:50.896 --> 01:31:52.202
Oh. come on. now.

1522
01:31:52.376 --> 01:31:53.725
FLANNERY [Narrating]:
Without her leg.

1523
01:31:53.899 --> 01:31:55.553
<i>she felt entirely dependent
on him.</i>

1524
01:31:55.727 --> 01:31:57.033
<i>Her brain seemed to have
stopped thinking altogether</i>

1525
01:31:57.207 --> 01:31:58.556
<i>and to be about
some other function</i>

1526
01:31:58.730 --> 01:31:59.905
<i>that it was not
entirely good at--</i>

1527
01:32:00.079 --> 01:32:01.733
<i>Not very good at.</i>

1528
01:32:01.907 --> 01:32:04.170
Without her leg. she seemed
entirely dependent on him.

1529
01:32:04.344 --> 01:32:05.911
What's the matter
with you all of a sudden?

1530
01:32:06.085 --> 01:32:07.522
And--
Yes.

1531
01:32:07.696 --> 01:32:09.915
And I thought
you were a Christian.

1532
01:32:10.089 --> 01:32:12.962
A fine Christian.

1533
01:32:13.136 --> 01:32:15.051
I hope you don't think
I believe in that crap.

1534
01:32:17.967 --> 01:32:19.838
Listen. I may sell bibles.
but I know which end is up.

1535
01:32:20.012 --> 01:32:22.406
and I wasn't born yesterday.

1536
01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:24.190
And I know
where I'm going.

1537
01:32:26.628 --> 01:32:28.412
Hey. Give me my leg!

1538
01:32:31.633 --> 01:32:32.764
Please.

1539
01:33:00.052 --> 01:33:01.924
I've gotten a lot of
interesting things.

1540
01:33:03.752 --> 01:33:05.841
One time I got
a woman's glass eye this way.

1541
01:33:08.844 --> 01:33:10.193
And you needn't to think
you'll catch me

1542
01:33:10.367 --> 01:33:11.760
'cause Pointer
ain't really my name.

1543
01:33:11.934 --> 01:33:13.588
I use a different name
at every house I call at

1544
01:33:13.762 --> 01:33:15.372
and don't stay nowhere long.

1545
01:33:19.637 --> 01:33:20.856
And I'll tell you
another thing. Hulga.

1546
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:22.640
you ain't so smart!

1547
01:33:26.078 --> 01:33:27.645
Come on.

1548
01:33:27.819 --> 01:33:30.909
I been believing in nothing
ever since I was born.

1576
01:35:50.396 --> 01:35:52.877
<i>making it down there

1577
01:35:53.051 --> 01:35:55.706

01:36:44.711 --> 01:36:47.062
<i>I sense you have
implanted in me.</i>

1581
01:36:47.236 --> 01:36:51.936
<i>in all of us. a desire

1582
01:36:52.110 --> 01:36:53.677

1583

<i>believer and unbeliever alike.
'Make us want.'</i>

1584
01:37:09.649 --> 01:37:10.825
Knock-knock.

1585
01:37:14.829 --> 01:37:16.178
You didn't come down
for breakfast.

1586
01:37:16.352 --> 01:37:18.180
'Cause it tastes like
a horse blanket.

1587
01:37:20.095 --> 01:37:21.226
Yeah.

1588
01:37:23.272 --> 01:37:26.231
Well...

1589
01:37:26.405 --> 01:37:29.931
Hopefully soon you'll
be able to have salt again.

1590
01:37:30.105 --> 01:37:33.586
Or milk. or eggs. or cheese.
or anything I like.

1591
01:37:35.197 --> 01:37:38.765
The treatment is worse
than the disease.

1592
01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:41.420
You gotta eat.

1593
01:37:41.594 --> 01:37:42.726
Have you tried it?

1594
01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:48.210
Have I tried--
Lord. no. I wouldn't eat that.

1595
01:37:48.384 --> 01:37:51.343
Nothing but plain oats.
Tastes like a horse blanket.

1596
01:37:56.783 --> 01:37:58.002
Oh. and I saw your peacock

1597
01:37:58.176 --> 01:37:59.482
having his breakfast
this morning.

1598
01:37:59.656 --> 01:38:02.267
You were right
about him eating Startena.

1599
01:38:02.441 --> 01:38:04.617
He also eats everything else.

1600
01:38:04.791 --> 01:38:08.708
No. he got every single one
of my Herbert Hoover roses.

1601
01:38:08.883 --> 01:38:11.407
And when he's not eating 'em.
he's sitting on top of 'em.

1602
01:38:12.974 --> 01:38:15.019
Well. what good is he?

1603
01:38:15.193 --> 01:38:17.674
He hasn't even put up
his tail feathers.

1604
01:38:17.848 --> 01:38:20.068
- Now. what ails him?
- Nothing ails him.

1605
01:38:20.242 --> 01:38:22.287
He'll put it up.
You just have to wait.

1606
01:38:22.461 --> 01:38:24.942
Mm.

1607
01:38:25.116 --> 01:38:28.554
I just have to get a wire fence
around my flowers.

1608
01:38:35.213 --> 01:38:36.911
Eat.

1609
01:38:43.613 --> 01:38:45.049
Oh.

1610
01:38:47.617 --> 01:38:50.185
It's nice you got this view
while you're writing.

1611
01:38:51.316 --> 01:38:52.535
Hmm.

1612
01:38:56.887 --> 01:38:58.323
I bet it helps.

1613
01:39:01.413 --> 01:39:03.241
Thank you. Mama.

1615
01:40:22.190 --> 01:40:24.061

01:40:24.235 --> 01:40:27.195
