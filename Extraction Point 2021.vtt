00:15:04.991 --> 00:15:06.122
This is crazy.

183
00:15:11.867 --> 00:15:13.216
This man. I need a drink please.

184
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.458

Okay. I'll be back on

186
00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:47.337
When I come back
we'll talk about all.

187
00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:48.382
Figure something out.

188
00:15:57.608 --> 00:16:01.482
I take a shower to take
them with me to be safe.

189
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.842

190
00:16:13.885 --> 00:16:15.670
- Now I have to take
him with me too?

191
00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:19.587
- You're gonna be safe.
he's gonna protect you.

192
00:16:25.462 --> 00:16:29.075
- Please I need
you. We need you.

193
00:16:29.118 --> 00:16:31.251
- All right give me the bag.

194
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.088

You're lucky I love you.

197
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:08.810

00:17:12.596 --> 00:17:14.990
Hormones is right enlightenment.

off due to stress.
different behaviors.

204
00:17:28.308 --> 00:17:30.049
Dr. Silva gave me these guests

205
00:17:32.138 --> 00:17:36.098
so I could be tagged
with these pheromones.

206
00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:42.148
You see. there's a reason
why he gave me these gifts

207
00:17:45.281 --> 00:17:49.329
and no gifts to you.
I'm his number one

208
00:17:51.461 --> 00:17:52.941
- And you're his number two.

209
00:18:01.732 --> 00:18:02.516
Let's go.

210
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.973

213
00:18:58.485 --> 00:18:59.747
I'm getting bad feelings.

214
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.704
What do you mean?

215
00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:02.097
You're getting a bad feeling.

216
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:04.143
Something is not right.

217
00:19:04.186 --> 00:19:06.014
I've started to
understand this more

218
00:19:06.057 --> 00:19:08.190
and more as I heal enough.

219
00:19:08.234 --> 00:19:08.973
- All right.

220
00:19:09.017 --> 00:19:09.931

225
00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:19.027
Alright. By the way. you never
told me how you got here.

226
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.203
- Oh. short down for years.

227
00:19:21.247 --> 00:19:24.075
We have to turn to make contacts

228
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:27.470
but everyone we've come across
to try to make us a study

229
00:19:27.514 --> 00:19:30.299

worse. wrong test.

232
00:19:32.693 --> 00:19:33.911
I mean. that's logical.

233
00:19:33.955 --> 00:19:36.000
I mean. I could
see that happening.

234
00:19:36.044 --> 00:19:38.046
Like I'm sorry to

367
00:29:02.958 --> 00:29:03.829

00:29:31.987 --> 00:29:32.858
[mumbles]

374
00:29:32.901 --> 00:29:33.902

375
00:29:33.946 --> 00:29:35.599
- Who the fuck would do this?

376
00:29:35.643 --> 00:29:37.079
- I don't know.

377
00:29:37.123 --> 00:29:40.387

in here. I didn't see nobody.

378
00:29:41.562 --> 00:29:44.043

Yo G I never see you

437
00:33:15.689 --> 00:33:18.648
Money talks and bullshit walks.

Bottom line.

440
00:33:21.086 --> 00:33:22.087
All of it.

00:33:24.089 --> 00:33:25.699
Good. Let's get a move on.

442
00:33:25.742 --> 00:33:27.614
I just got the text from

443
00:33:27.657 --> 00:33:28.789
It's not far from here.

444
00:33:30.051 --> 00:33:32.662
[tense music]

445
00:33:36.666 --> 00:33:38.059
- What'd you say you parked at?

446
00:33:38.103 --> 00:33:39.713
- Just at the end of the block.

447
00:33:39.756 --> 00:33:41.062
- This way?

448
00:33:41.106 --> 00:33:42.107

449
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.151
- Don't use the car.

450
00:33:43.195 --> 00:33:44.805
- Hold on. hold on one second.

451
00:33:44.848 --> 00:33:47.721
- The have a tracking
sensor on it.

452
00:33:53.118 --> 00:33:54.206
- I'm becoming very weak.

453
00:33:54.249 --> 00:33:56.686

the fluid from the jar.

456
00:34:01.082 --> 00:34:02.562
And add a little bit of water.

457
00:34:02.605 --> 00:34:04.433
I think I got a
bottle of water here.

458
00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:11.136
Can you grab one?

459
00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.051
Can you grab a bottle
of water over there?

460
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.793
Hold on brother.

461
00:34:16.837 --> 00:34:17.620

Alright brother. you said

park around here right here.

464

- Yeah there should
be a park around here.

465
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.839
I know exactly what a park is.

466
00:35:02.883 --> 00:35:05.059
That it's about 10 minutes.

467
00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:06.104
Deli. We almost there.

468
00:35:07.061 --> 00:35:07.931
Yes. it's close.

- C'mon we're almost there.

470
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.852

Jackson it is very close.

471
00:35:40.268 --> 00:35:41.269

474
00:35:43.228 --> 00:35:44.142
- Yeah sure.

475
00:35:44.185 --> 00:35:46.361
- How come you never smile

476
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:51.061
- I mean I smile. I just
don't smile all the time.

477
00:35:53.412 --> 00:35:55.805
- Hope I get to see it one day.

478
00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:56.980
- You never know.

479
00:35:57.024 --> 00:35:58.808
Maybe it could happen.

480
00:35:59.809 --> 00:36:00.593
- Yeah we'll see.

481
00:36:00.636 --> 00:36:02.377

506
00:37:40.823 --> 00:37:43.043
[mumbles]

00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:46.568
So you take care of them yet?

508
00:37:46.612 --> 00:37:50.442
We did. but not all is
passed on to another person.

509
00:37:50.485 --> 00:37:52.444
So there's one dead. and another

510
00:37:52.487 --> 00:37:55.011
that's attempting to get him
to the location. correct?

511
00:37:55.055 --> 00:37:56.361
Have you contacted Dr.

512
00:37:56.404 --> 00:38:00.365
Silva? He knows what
I need to know about.

513
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:07.285
- What don't I

514
00:38:07.328 --> 00:38:08.982
So I knew something was wrong.

00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:17.338
knowing something was wrong.

517
00:38:17.382 --> 00:38:19.297
I knew you'd call
for assistance.

518
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.038
- Sir we had everything
under control.

519
00:38:22.082 --> 00:38:23.475
- Was I speaking to you.

520
00:38:25.041 --> 00:38:28.654
then keep your mouth shut
until I do understood.

521
00:38:32.527 --> 00:38:33.920

00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:08.476
by allowing the alien
brain expanding is possibly

530
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.260
tightening his senses.

531
00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:17.355
Stay with me.
