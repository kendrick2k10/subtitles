Jonathan Maisel.

[ Cheers and applause ]

1065
00:50:44.667 --> 00:50:46.502
My name is Jonathan Maisel.

1066
00:50:46.502 --> 00:50:48.629
and I am a park duty manager
here at EPCOT.

1067
00:50:48.629 --> 00:50:49.838
I grew up in Florida.

1068
00:50:49.838 --> 00:50:50.965
I'm originally from
Fort Lauderdale. Florida.

1069
00:50:50.965 --> 00:50:52.341
and Walt Disney World

1070
00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:55.386
was my family's
vacation destination.

1071
00:50:55.386 --> 00:50:57.596
It was always
the cast members that made me

1072
00:50:57.596 --> 00:50:59.181
keep wanting to come back
to Walt Disney World.

1073
00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:01.267
because every time I met
a cast member.

1074
00:51:01.267 --> 00:51:02.726
it was just
a different interaction.

1075
00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.770
and the magic it created for me.

1076
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:07.565
I always knew as a kid.
this is where I wanted to be.

1077
00:51:09.858 --> 00:51:12.570
So I've been a cast member
at Disney here for eight years.

1078
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:14.863
Our role as
the park duty manager

1079
00:51:14.863 --> 00:51:17.116
is helping maintain the park.

1080
00:51:17.116 --> 00:51:18.534
So we're going around.
checking in

1081
00:51:18.534 --> 00:51:20.452
with all our lines of business

1082
00:51:20.452 --> 00:51:21.954
and just seeing
the flow of the park.

1083
00:51:21.954 --> 00:51:23.747
You look a little lost.
How may I assist you today?

1084
00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:25.457
Have fun tonight!

1085
00:51:25.457 --> 00:51:27.543
I think my favorite part
of interacting with our guests

1086
00:51:27.543 --> 00:51:29.086
is finding out more about them.

1087
00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:30.963
Where are they traveling from?
Why are they here?

1088
00:51:30.963 --> 00:51:33.090
You know.
what are we celebrating today?

1089
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:34.550
So to see the smile
on their face

1090
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:36.010
when they come
through the gates.

1091
00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:37.177
it's just unbelievable.

1092
00:51:38.846 --> 00:51:44.184
The Legacy Award is a
very. very prestigious honor

1093
00:51:44.184 --> 00:51:45.561
that only a very small
percentage

1094
00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:47.605
of our cast members
are nominated for

1095
00:51:47.605 --> 00:51:49.940
and then selected.

1096
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.483
Jonathan: It's through
a whole nomination process.

1097
00:51:51.483 --> 00:51:53.777
and it's all a surprise.
so you have no idea.

1098
00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:57.072
For me. I was actually
in a meeting. and I look.

1099
00:51:57.072 --> 00:52:00.034
and there was that
Walt Disney plaque

1100
00:52:00.034 --> 00:52:03.037
and my name.
and I was just stunned.

1101
00:52:03.037 --> 00:52:04.663
Karen: He is so deserving.

1102
00:52:04.663 --> 00:52:07.458
Jonathan has always had
a very strong cast focus.

1103
00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:09.335
Our cast are so important.

1104
00:52:09.335 --> 00:52:12.379
Having them know what
their value is really translate

1105
00:52:12.379 --> 00:52:14.214
into how they perform their role

1106
00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:16.717
and how they make
our guests feel.

1107
00:52:16.717 --> 00:52:18.636
I think the most important thing
about this award

1108
00:52:18.636 --> 00:52:21.513
and receiving it
is that it came from peers

1109
00:52:21.513 --> 00:52:25.309
who felt that I do dream.
create. and inspire.

1110
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:27.102
Every day.
putting on this name tag.

1111
00:52:27.102 --> 00:52:28.687
I still shake every day.

1112
00:52:28.687 --> 00:52:30.648
Karen: When people see someone
wearing a blue name tag.

1113
00:52:30.648 --> 00:52:32.399
they automatically

1114
00:52:32.399 --> 00:52:34.193
put you in almost like
a different category.

1115
00:52:34.193 --> 00:52:36.737
And for Jonathan.
I think when they see him.

1116
00:52:36.737 --> 00:52:38.113
they know that.

1117
00:52:38.113 --> 00:52:39.573
But then when they start
to talk to him.

1118
00:52:39.573 --> 00:52:41.825
because he smiles and
the way he makes people feel.

1119
00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:44.578
they're like.
I see why he's gotten it.

1120
00:52:44.578 --> 00:52:47.998
It was just such
an honor to receive this award

1121
00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:49.833
and to wear this blue name tag
every day

1122
00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:53.379
is just outstanding to me.

1123
00:52:53.379 --> 00:52:56.382
Jonathan is just one of
many cast members

1124
00:52:56.382 --> 00:52:59.677

magic for the past 50 years.
