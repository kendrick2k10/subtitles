00:54:25.736 --> 00:54:28.672
and he tried to get me down
all the way to the bottom.

376
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.476
He was a righteous man.

377
00:54:35.446 --> 00:54:37.549
He was a self-righteous man.

378
00:54:38.915 --> 00:54:40.951
There's no forgiveness
in that man.

379
00:54:42.453 --> 00:54:46.558
He did to me

411
00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:37.900
Your fate is always
in somebody else's hands!

And it's your family's fate
to suffer!

Your grandfather
didn't know that!

He didn't believe it.

415
00:56:44.674 --> 00:56:47.911
so he took fate in his own hands
and he crossed me!

The truth is...

431
00:58:07.957 --> 00:58:11.759
I cannot look in my son's face

Where are you?

560
01:12:23.645 --> 01:12:25.482
[Charlie panting]

561
01:12:38.661 --> 01:12:40.029
[Charlie panting]

562
01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:42.800
Got you. you little prick.

563
01:12:46.769 --> 01:12:47.771
Get over here!

564
01:12:53.142 --> 01:12:54.978
[wind whistling]

565
01:13:44.727 --> 01:13:45.962
[screams]

566
01:13:47.029 --> 01:13:47.965
Don't.

567
01:14:05.715 --> 01:14:07.918
Go and tend to the generator.

568
01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:12.589
Now!

569
01:14:22.631 --> 01:14:23.733
[door closes]

570
01:14:49.759 --> 01:14:53.660
You know.
I can't remember a time

571
01:14:53.662 --> 01:14:57.765
when I wasn't driven by rage.

572
01:14:57.767 --> 01:15:02.104
and my father saw it in me
when I was a little boy.

573
01:15:03.939 --> 01:15:06.173
He tried to beat it out of me.

574
01:15:06.175 --> 01:15:09.075
Imagine his surprise.

575
01:15:09.077 --> 01:15:11.878
how it all
came to a head for him

576
01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.182
when I came of age.

577
01:15:21.724 --> 01:15:25.662
You know. I kept Hobbs first
out of curiosity.

578
01:15:28.831 --> 01:15:31.932
I thought I saw in her
a little bit of me.

579
01:15:31.934 --> 01:15:34.935
and I was right.

580
01:15:34.937 --> 01:15:37.974
If I didn't kill her father.
she would have.

581
01:15:39.776 --> 01:15:42.075
But I only kept the others...

582
01:15:42.077 --> 01:15:44.046
for weeding. housekeeping.

583
01:15:45.814 --> 01:15:50.086
You were the first one
I ever met I felt no rage for.

584
01:15:53.156 --> 01:15:55.158
You were the son I never had.

585
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:03.700
But you can't change
a man's true nature.

586
01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:17.878
The day your mother ran off.

587
01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.917
I should have known
I couldn't trust you.

588
01:16:22.117 --> 01:16:23.719
But today. you proved it.

589
01:16:24.854 --> 01:16:25.985
You got her...

590
01:16:25.987 --> 01:16:29.255
her betrayal...

591
01:16:29.257 --> 01:16:31.357
in your nature.

592
01:16:31.359 --> 01:16:34.160
She betrayed her husband.

593
01:16:34.162 --> 01:16:36.297
She...
she tried to betray me.

594
01:16:36.299 --> 01:16:38.268
and she certainly
betrayed you...

595
01:16:39.402 --> 01:16:42.770
...when she ran off
and left you here alone.

596
01:16:42.772 --> 01:16:44.204
Huh?

597
01:16:44.206 --> 01:16:46.140
I should have killed you...

598
01:16:46.142 --> 01:16:48.211
the day I killed your mother.

599
01:16:54.884 --> 01:16:56.886
[screaming]

600
01:17:01.858 --> 01:17:03.994
[Father]: Don't die!
Don't die!

601
01:17:11.032 --> 01:17:12.301
[generator rumbling]

602
01:17:18.174 --> 01:17:19.309
[Seth screams]

603
01:17:21.810 --> 01:17:23.143
[screaming]

604
01:17:23.145 --> 01:17:24.410
Don't die!

605
01:17:24.412 --> 01:17:26.112
Don't die!

606
01:17:26.114 --> 01:17:27.213
Don't die!

607
01:17:27.215 --> 01:17:28.184
Don't die.

608
01:17:30.419 --> 01:17:31.852
I need you. Come on.

609
01:17:31.854 --> 01:17:32.986
Come on.

610
01:17:32.988 --> 01:17:35.291
I need you.
I need you.

611
01:17:39.327 --> 01:17:41.063
I'm not going to die.

612
01:17:43.431 --> 01:17:45.432
I'm not going to die...

613
01:17:45.434 --> 01:17:46.937
until you die.

614
01:18:04.153 --> 01:18:07.891
I always knew
you were my only weakness.

615
01:18:10.926 --> 01:18:12.194
A man has to kill...

616
01:18:13.295 --> 01:18:14.396
...what makes
him weak.

617
01:18:17.399 --> 01:18:18.367
Father!

618
01:18:21.269 --> 01:18:22.902
Where is...

619
01:18:22.904 --> 01:18:25.142
my son?

620
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:28.377
[screams]

621
01:18:44.059 --> 01:18:46.028
[Clair]: Where is he?
Where is he?

622
01:18:55.904 --> 01:18:56.907
Mom!

623
01:19:11.287 --> 01:19:13.020
I was always your fate.

624
01:19:13.022 --> 01:19:14.021
[Larsen]: Father...

625
01:19:14.023 --> 01:19:16.022
This is for my mother!

626
01:19:16.024 --> 01:19:17.223
[screams]

627
01:19:17.225 --> 01:19:18.929
[gunshots firing]

628
01:19:24.934 --> 01:19:26.002
No!

629
01:19:26.969 --> 01:19:28.205
[gunshots firing]

630
01:19:32.407 --> 01:19:34.176
Charlie.

631
01:19:38.113 --> 01:19:39.280
Are you okay?

632
01:19:39.282 --> 01:19:40.547
[Charlie]: I'm okay.

633
01:19:40.549 --> 01:19:42.385
- Okay.
- I'm okay.

634
01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:53.163
I got my boy back.
thanks to you.

635
01:19:55.197 --> 01:19:56.562
I'm...

636
01:19:56.564 --> 01:19:58.434
getting off this mountain.

637
01:20:00.435 --> 01:20:01.438
Yeah.

638
01:20:42.411 --> 01:20:44.114
[wind whistling]

639
01:21:01.162 --> 01:21:03.030
Come on. Charlie.

640
01:21:03.032 --> 01:21:04.034
Let's go.

641
01:21:19.281 --> 01:21:21.283
[snowmobile engine turns over]

642
01:21:46.509 --> 01:21:48.144
[growling]

643
01:21:55.317 --> 01:21:56.252
[growling]

644
01:22:00.422 --> 01:22:02.224
[screaming]

645
01:22:07.529 --> 01:22:09.398
[screaming. then silence]

646
01:22:29.617 --> 01:22:34.490
[♪♪♪]

647
01:22:52.741 --> 01:22:54.377
Guess you'll need
these back.

648
01:22:55.411 --> 01:22:58.114
Why don't you hang
onto them for me?

649
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:24.340
[♪♪♪]
