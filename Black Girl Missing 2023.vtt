00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:13.883
Mom!

4
00:00:30.117 --> 00:00:32.380
Lauren!

5
00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.859
Lauren!

6
00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:35.731
- Mom!
- Lauren!

7
00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:36.906
Lauren!

8
00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:01.800
Lauren?

9
00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:04.498
Honey. are you awake?

10
00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:37.140
Hey.

11
00:01:37.227 --> 00:01:39.621
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

12
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:42.319
I just...

13
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.583
I don't know how long
I can take it anymore.

14
00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:47.933
When can I finally see you?

15
00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:03.253
Are you kidding me?

16
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.560
Sweet Rose has
the best ice cream for sure.

17
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.562
Are you crazy. Lauren?

18
00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.738
You and dad only like
Sweet Rose

19
00:02:09.868 --> 00:02:11.435
because they had that
gross pickle-flavored ice cream.

20
00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:13.785
What was it called?

21
00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:17.485
-Number 23. The Big Dill.
-Ew.

22
00:02:17.615 --> 00:02:19.139
Okay.
don't be hating just because

23
00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:20.966
you have basic taste.
Miss Vanilla.

24
00:02:21.053 --> 00:02:23.882
Ah!

25
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.541
Ouch.

26
00:02:30.672 --> 00:02:32.674
Lauren. be careful.

27
00:02:32.804 --> 00:02:33.849
Okay. Sorry.

28
00:02:33.978 --> 00:02:36.329
It's not my fault
you're so tender-headed.

29
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.070
Okay. my scalp
was just out of practice.

30
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.550
I mean. Mom's too busy.

31
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.161
and there's not
a braiding shop for. like.

32
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:44.120
a hundred miles
of this lame town.

33
00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:45.382
You still not vibing
with Blue Valley?

34
00:02:45.513 --> 00:02:49.038
Um. I'm not in college
having fun like you are.

35
00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:52.084
I'm stuck here with Mom.
and all I do is school.

36
00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:55.305
homework. and sleep
like a little no-fun robot.

37
00:02:55.392 --> 00:02:57.525
You haven't made any friends?

38
00:02:57.655 --> 00:02:59.004
With who?

39
00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:04.967
The meatheads or Future Farmers
at Blue Valley High?

40
00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:07.578
You have to try. Marley.

41
00:03:07.665 --> 00:03:12.103
Trust me. it gets worse
if you isolate yourself.

42
00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:24.247
Who is spamming your phone?

43
00:03:24.334 --> 00:03:27.424
Is it a secret boyfriend?
Maybe a sworn mortal enemy?

44
00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:30.732
Girl. mind your business.
It is no one. okay?

45
00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:38.174
Lauren. you don't have to hide
anything from me. you know?

46
00:03:38.305 --> 00:03:40.611
I just want
to make sure you're okay.

47
00:03:40.698 --> 00:03:44.659
Hey. I'mthe big sister.

48
00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:47.749
Supposed to worry about
if you're okay. not vice versa.

49
00:03:47.836 --> 00:03:48.924
Okay. Peanut?

50
00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:52.144
Ooh. mm-mm.

51
00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:55.103
Fine. fine. but do not
call me Peanut. I'm 15.

52
00:03:55.191 --> 00:03:57.759
I don't care
if you're 15 or however old.

53
00:03:57.846 --> 00:04:01.545
You're still gonna always be
my little. little Peanut.

54
00:04:04.156 --> 00:04:08.509
When do you go back to school?
Soon? I hope so.

55
00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:11.686
All right.
let me snap a picture.

56
00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:14.384
I'm gonna post it tonight
for. uh. #styleitSaturdays.

57
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:16.212
Okay.

58
00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:18.432
Um...

59
00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.608
-Here. let's just take a selfie.
-Okay.

60
00:04:24.046 --> 00:04:25.961
Lauren. smile.

61
00:04:26.091 --> 00:04:28.224
- Aren't you happy?
- Yes.

62
00:04:30.748 --> 00:04:32.707
Breakfast!

63
00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:34.274
Okay. Wait. do you smell that?

64
00:04:34.404 --> 00:04:35.884
I do.
I'll race you to it.

65
00:04:35.971 --> 00:04:37.015
Okay.

66
00:04:37.102 --> 00:04:39.148
I'm right behind you.

67
00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:44.980
Girls! Hello? Breakfast!

68
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.374
I'm coming.

69
00:04:50.115 --> 00:04:52.466
Hey. hey. hey!
No running in my kitchen.

70
00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:55.207
I did not raise
a pack of animals.

71
00:04:55.295 --> 00:05:00.778
Oh! These braids are beautiful.
You did this. Lauren?

72
00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:02.954
-It's no biggie.
-Oh. it's no biggie.

73
00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:07.307
Well. I...appreciate it.

74
00:05:07.437 --> 00:05:09.004
Okay. Mom.

75
00:05:09.134 --> 00:05:12.050
Oh. my girls
are growing up too fast.

76
00:05:12.137 --> 00:05:13.487
You know. not long ago.

77
00:05:13.617 --> 00:05:16.707
I couldn't pay you to sit still
long enough for braids.

78
00:05:16.794 --> 00:05:18.970
I don't know how I raised
these tender-headed children.

79
00:05:19.057 --> 00:05:20.407
Huh.

80
00:05:20.537 --> 00:05:22.104
Pot...meet kettle.

81
00:05:22.191 --> 00:05:23.975
Shut it. Peanut.

82
00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:29.154
Look at all of us together.

83
00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:31.896
I love it.

84
00:05:32.027 --> 00:05:34.682
It's nice to have you home
for the weekend. Lauren.

85
00:05:34.812 --> 00:05:38.381
Yeah. I'm happy I'm here. too.

86
00:05:38.468 --> 00:05:41.341
Although I did think that
since you're just 20 minutes

87
00:05:41.428 --> 00:05:45.214
up the road. that we get
to see you a little more often.

88
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.739
Sorry.
I just have a lot going on.

89
00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:50.611
Like what? I want to know.

90
00:05:50.698 --> 00:05:53.091
I want to know everything
that's going on at school.

91
00:05:53.178 --> 00:05:55.224
Why don't you tell me
about your new job first?

92
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.922
How is it being VP?

93
00:05:58.053 --> 00:06:02.884
It's good.
I mean. it's a lot. but...good.

94
00:06:03.014 --> 00:06:06.191
Was it worth
moving across the country?

95
00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:08.280
I think we all needed
a fresh start

96
00:06:08.411 --> 00:06:11.545
after Dad passed away.

97
00:06:13.503 --> 00:06:17.377
Yeah. You know. I thought the VP
was supposed to be a step up.

98
00:06:17.507 --> 00:06:19.944
They have you doing your job
and. like. five others.

99
00:06:20.075 --> 00:06:22.686
I know. I am just
trying to do what I got to do.

100
00:06:22.773 --> 00:06:25.297
Enough about me.

101
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.691
Lauren.
I want to know everything

102
00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:29.867
that's going on in college.

103
00:06:29.998 --> 00:06:32.174
Can we talk about it later?

104
00:06:32.304 --> 00:06:34.742
Why can't we talk about it now?

105
00:06:34.872 --> 00:06:37.571
I just don't want
to talk about it now.

106
00:06:37.658 --> 00:06:39.659
Uh. you know. these potatoes
look really nice. Mom.

107
00:06:39.747 --> 00:06:42.880
The bacon looks good.
You even have eggs.

108
00:06:42.967 --> 00:06:45.709
Why are you avoiding
talking about school?

109
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.755
Is there a problem?

110
00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:50.235
I'm just...

111
00:06:50.322 --> 00:06:52.586
I'm really unhappy there.

112
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:58.940
That's news to me.
Are your grades dropping?

113
00:06:59.027 --> 00:07:02.509
-I knew you would act like that.
-Okay. guys. we cannot--

114
00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.553
Act like what?
I'm just trying to understand.

115
00:07:03.684 --> 00:07:05.642
Are you saying
that you want to switch schools?

116
00:07:05.773 --> 00:07:09.429
No. Mom. I'm saying
that I want to drop out.

117
00:07:12.127 --> 00:07:13.694
Uh-oh.

118
00:07:13.824 --> 00:07:15.565
Marley. go to your room.

119
00:07:15.696 --> 00:07:18.220
-Mom.
-Go to your room.

120
00:07:19.613 --> 00:07:21.136
Well...

121
00:07:24.356 --> 00:07:25.357
Absolutely not.

122
00:07:25.488 --> 00:07:27.272
You're not even listening to me.

123
00:07:27.359 --> 00:07:28.796
Oh. I hear you.

124
00:07:28.926 --> 00:07:31.407
You want to throw your life
away and drop out of school?

125
00:07:31.538 --> 00:07:33.148
Okay. that's not fair. Mom.

126
00:07:33.235 --> 00:07:37.195
You know what's not fair?
The time. the money.

127
00:07:37.326 --> 00:07:40.155
I mean. all the effort to
prepare you for the Ivy League.

128
00:07:40.284 --> 00:07:42.766
And no one asked you
to do any of that.

129
00:07:42.897 --> 00:07:47.205
Mom. I'm trying to tell you.

130
00:07:47.336 --> 00:07:48.903
I think I'm depressed.

131
00:07:50.731 --> 00:07:52.863
You don't look depressed to me.

132
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.171
Well. maybe you're seeing
whatever youwanna see.

133
00:07:56.301 --> 00:08:00.915
I can't focus in school.
I'm always tired.

134
00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:06.442
I just...feel empty.

135
00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:10.402
Okay. Lauren. baby. I know
this is a tough transition.

136
00:08:10.533 --> 00:08:12.274
but when I was your age.

137
00:08:12.404 --> 00:08:13.884
I was too busy supporting myself
through college

138
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:15.582
to feel depressed.

139
00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:17.714
Okay. so because
you had a rough childhood.

140
00:08:17.801 --> 00:08:19.063
I'm not supposed
to feel anything?

141
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.198
Oh. my God. Your generation
is obsessed with feelings.

142
00:08:23.328 --> 00:08:27.724
If you're overwhelmed.
just come home.

143
00:08:27.855 --> 00:08:30.466
If I was to stay here.
I'd go crazy.

144
00:08:31.946 --> 00:08:34.861
So what do you think.
I'm running a torture chamber?

145
00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:37.952
Do you know
how good you have it?

146
00:08:38.082 --> 00:08:40.476
You have a beautiful home
with a family that loves you.

147
00:08:40.563 --> 00:08:42.826
Mom. I can't keep up
with this fake orange juice

148
00:08:42.913 --> 00:08:45.220
Life commercial thing
that you're trying to live.

149
00:08:45.307 --> 00:08:47.048
It's bullshit.

150
00:08:50.355 --> 00:08:52.749
I am so glad your father
isn't here to see this.

151
00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:56.536
He would be so disappointed.

152
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:02.150
Lauren. I didn't mean that.

153
00:09:02.237 --> 00:09:04.152
I-I didn't mean that. babe.

154
00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:12.552
You're leaving early?

155
00:09:14.858 --> 00:09:16.904
I can't be around here
right now.

156
00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:22.910
M-Maybe we can talk about it.

157
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.266
I'll see you later. Peanut.
okay?

158
00:10:04.299 --> 00:10:06.388
You've reached Lauren.
I'm not here.

159
00:10:06.518 --> 00:10:07.781
Leave a message.

160
00:10:07.868 --> 00:10:12.133
Lauren. it's Mom.

161
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.789
This radio silence has gone
too long. Call me back.

162
00:10:15.876 --> 00:10:18.313
Please?

163
00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:23.884
Blue Valley. Texas.
is home for today's best music.

164
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:26.756
94.7. In national news.

165
00:10:26.843 --> 00:10:29.324
missing 18-year-old Oregon girl
Jessica Russo

166
00:10:29.411 --> 00:10:31.631
has not been seen
for several days.

167
00:10:31.718 --> 00:10:33.328
Reports say
she was last seen--

168
00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:35.504
Hey. I was listening to that.

169
00:10:35.591 --> 00:10:36.679
I have to focus.

170
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.465
I'm stressed
about this chem exam today.

171
00:10:40.596 --> 00:10:43.512
No reason to be stressed if you
had studied hard enough. right?

172
00:10:43.599 --> 00:10:46.036
And I've seen
you working your butt off.

173
00:10:46.123 --> 00:10:49.083
Yeah. but now that I hit
the social outcast jackpot.

174
00:10:49.213 --> 00:10:50.388
being both the new kid

175
00:10:50.475 --> 00:10:51.346
and the vice principal's
daughter.

176
00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:54.958
Mom. academic excellence
is all I have.

177
00:10:55.089 --> 00:10:56.917
You got an "A"-minus
on the last exam.

178
00:10:57.047 --> 00:10:59.267
"A"-plus is excellent.

179
00:11:02.923 --> 00:11:05.273
Good morning. Blue Valley High.

180
00:11:05.403 --> 00:11:07.492
It's Principal Shepherd here.
your biggest cheerleader.

181
00:11:07.623 --> 00:11:09.451
It's another beautiful day.

182
00:11:09.538 --> 00:11:12.933
another chance
to academically excel.

183
00:11:13.063 --> 00:11:14.804
And I want to
say good luck to all of you

184
00:11:14.891 --> 00:11:17.589
taking the state placement exam
this morning.

185
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.463
We believe in you. We know
you can do it. Go. Tigers!

186
00:11:43.398 --> 00:11:44.878
Stop.

187
00:11:44.965 --> 00:11:47.707
Bitch.

188
00:11:58.674 --> 00:12:01.242
Hey. Slow down!
Stop running.

189
00:12:03.113 --> 00:12:05.072
Mr. Guilford.

190
00:12:05.202 --> 00:12:06.726
No hoodies.

191
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.035
Enough. you two.

192
00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:14.734
Hands and tongues to ourselves.

193
00:12:18.694 --> 00:12:21.262
Hey. yo. hit me.

194
00:12:21.349 --> 00:12:24.265
Hey!

195
00:12:24.395 --> 00:12:27.094
-Whoops.
-What did I do to you. Josh?

196
00:12:27.224 --> 00:12:30.575
I'm not gonna let you cheat off
of me because you didn't study.

197
00:12:30.706 --> 00:12:34.188
I don't like people like you.

198
00:12:34.275 --> 00:12:35.798
What does that mean?

199
00:12:35.885 --> 00:12:37.800
You think you're better
than everyone

200
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:39.671
just 'cause you're
the vice principal's daughter?

201
00:12:39.802 --> 00:12:42.631
No. I don't. I literally just...

202
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:43.980
Oh. my God.

203
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:45.765
Mr. Whelan.

204
00:12:47.375 --> 00:12:49.507
What do you think you're doing?

205
00:12:49.594 --> 00:12:51.292
It was an accident.

206
00:12:51.422 --> 00:12:53.903
Are you planning to apologize?

207
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.426
Sorry. Marley. Can I go?

208
00:12:55.557 --> 00:12:59.039
Yes.
to the principal's office. Now.

209
00:13:03.913 --> 00:13:06.916
What is this that Josh
is trying to cheat off of you?

210
00:13:07.047 --> 00:13:10.354
Don't freak out. Mom. I got it.

211
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:12.879
My daughter hides the fact that
she's being bullied in school?

212
00:13:12.966 --> 00:13:15.272
I think I can freak out
a little.

213
00:13:15.359 --> 00:13:19.059
I'm just doing what
you taught us--grin and bear it.

214
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.204
Ahem.

215
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.467
Hey. Cheryl.

216
00:13:36.554 --> 00:13:37.642
Hi.

217
00:13:37.729 --> 00:13:39.122
I have the. uh. minutes

218
00:13:39.253 --> 00:13:40.732
from the PTA meeting
from last week.

219
00:13:40.863 --> 00:13:42.604
Ah. great. Thank you.

220
00:13:42.734 --> 00:13:44.693
We have three teachers
on maternity leave.

221
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.260
so I took the liberty
of rearranging

222
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.349
the detention monitor schedules.

223
00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:50.612
Great. Great. Thanks.

224
00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:52.788
No idea what we'd do without you
if you hadn't showed up here.

225
00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:56.096
Um. Principal Shepherd.

226
00:13:56.183 --> 00:13:58.489
have you had a chance
to speak with. uh. Josh Whelan?

227
00:13:58.576 --> 00:14:00.230
Uh. yeah. it looks like

228
00:14:00.361 --> 00:14:03.755
it was just some sort of
miscommunication. I guess.

229
00:14:03.886 --> 00:14:06.889
I saw him knock the books
out of my daughter's hand

230
00:14:06.976 --> 00:14:08.630
because she wouldn't
let him cheat off of her.

231
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.328
Well. you know. he assured me
that it was an accident.

232
00:14:11.415 --> 00:14:13.243
This is actually
the first thing I'm hearing

233
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.811
about anything
about cheating. Cheryl.

234
00:14:15.942 --> 00:14:19.554
Respectfully. sir.
he's lying to you.

235
00:14:19.641 --> 00:14:21.512
and you and I both know
that his behavior

236
00:14:21.643 --> 00:14:23.079
is against the code of conduct.

237
00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:25.125
Where the hell are the forms for
the district? I can't find 'em.

238
00:14:25.212 --> 00:14:27.170
Bottom right drawer.

239
00:14:27.257 --> 00:14:30.086
Oh. Okay. Here we go.

240
00:14:30.217 --> 00:14:31.827
Perfect. Thank you.

241
00:14:31.914 --> 00:14:33.176
Look. Cheryl.

242
00:14:33.307 --> 00:14:36.179
I have known this young man
and his family for years.

243
00:14:36.266 --> 00:14:37.441
These are good people.

244
00:14:37.572 --> 00:14:38.834
I don't doubt that. but I--

245
00:14:38.965 --> 00:14:40.705
And I don't need to tell you

246
00:14:40.836 --> 00:14:43.056
that the school is basically
running on fumes. you know?

247
00:14:43.186 --> 00:14:45.101
The school district is
looking down our throats.

248
00:14:45.232 --> 00:14:47.190
and I-I don't think
we need to provoke them now

249
00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:50.411
with accusations about cheating
and bullying and...

250
00:14:50.498 --> 00:14:52.239
Hang on one sec.

251
00:14:52.369 --> 00:14:54.458
Hello? Hey. uh.
Superintendent Richards.

252
00:14:54.589 --> 00:14:55.372
Thank you so much for calling.
Yeah. No. I have the forms.

253
00:14:55.503 --> 00:14:57.679
I'm just--Hold--
Can you hold up one sec?

254
00:14:57.766 --> 00:14:59.507
Could you--
Cheryl. do you mind?

255
00:14:59.637 --> 00:15:03.424
I just need a second.
Thank you. Yeah. So. I'm sorry.

256
00:15:03.511 --> 00:15:05.382
Yeah. I'm--
I'm working on it right now.

257
00:15:05.513 --> 00:15:06.993
...The boyfriend

258
00:15:07.123 --> 00:15:09.647
of missing Oregon teenager
Jessica Russo

259
00:15:09.778 --> 00:15:13.782
has become the target of
substantial online harassment.

260
00:15:13.869 --> 00:15:16.176
That behavior is
leading a lot of people

261
00:15:16.263 --> 00:15:17.003
on social media to...

262
00:15:17.133 --> 00:15:20.006
I heard about this on the radio.

263
00:15:20.093 --> 00:15:22.051
Turn up the volume.

264
00:15:22.182 --> 00:15:24.053
Family and friends of Jessica

265
00:15:24.184 --> 00:15:26.838
and also volunteers
all around the country

266
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:30.016
pursue leads and also try
to spread awareness.

267
00:15:30.146 --> 00:15:33.454
Rogers. the last person
to have seen her alive.

268
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.022
is refusing to do interviews.

269
00:15:36.152 --> 00:15:41.505
We believe someone
took our angel. Jessica.

270
00:15:41.592 --> 00:15:46.815
I-I just keep replaying what
she said to me before she left.

271
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.644
"I love you. Mom."

272
00:15:49.774 --> 00:15:51.298
Oh. God.

273
00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:53.996
That poor family.

274
00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:57.217
Can you imagine
if that was your child?

275
00:15:57.347 --> 00:15:59.871
Absolutely not.

276
00:16:00.002 --> 00:16:01.482
...around the clock
with this search.

277
00:16:01.612 --> 00:16:04.267
Hey. are you okay over there?

278
00:16:04.354 --> 00:16:06.487
Um...yeah. it's nothing.

279
00:16:06.574 --> 00:16:09.490
I had a little argument
with my eldest.

280
00:16:09.577 --> 00:16:10.970
Didn't end well?

281
00:16:11.057 --> 00:16:13.320
She hasn't returned my call
in two days or texts.

282
00:16:13.407 --> 00:16:17.802
which isn't like her.
even when she's pissed at Mom.

283
00:16:17.889 --> 00:16:21.589
Listen. when our son
went to college.

284
00:16:21.719 --> 00:16:25.332
well. we didn't hear from him
for months at a clip...

285
00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:28.770
unless he needed. um. pizza
or beer money. of course.

286
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.903
Of course.

287
00:16:32.034 --> 00:16:34.950
So. you know.
it's natural to worry. Cheryl.

288
00:16:35.037 --> 00:16:40.129
Just...don't make yourself sick
about it.

289
00:16:40.216 --> 00:16:44.394
You're right.
Thank you. Susan.

290
00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:47.528
We have been searching
since about 6:00.

291
00:16:47.615 --> 00:16:48.920
It's your girl. Lauren.

292
00:16:49.051 --> 00:16:52.315
and today I am naming
my top five favorite hairstyles.

293
00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:55.623
To start off. you know.
we have to do the pigtails.

294
00:16:55.753 --> 00:16:57.364
which is what I'm wearing
right now with my curly hair.

295
00:16:57.451 --> 00:16:58.974
Second up. we--

296
00:17:03.718 --> 00:17:07.374
I guess I didn't make it
to #Saturdaystyles.

297
00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:21.518
Hey. Why are you on your phone

298
00:17:21.605 --> 00:17:23.215
when you're supposed
to be doing your chores?

299
00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:27.220
This is why Lauren left.

300
00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:28.917
Excuse me?

301
00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.528
I said.
maybe if you weren't so aggro.

302
00:17:31.615 --> 00:17:33.704
Lauren wouldn't have left early.

303
00:17:33.835 --> 00:17:36.838
I didn't force Lauren to leave.

304
00:17:36.968 --> 00:17:38.666
No. but you chased her away.

305
00:17:38.753 --> 00:17:40.363
and now she won't
even talk to me.

306
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.758
You haven't heard from her
since she left?

307
00:17:43.888 --> 00:17:46.021
Negative.

308
00:17:46.152 --> 00:17:48.154
Has she posted anything online?

309
00:17:48.241 --> 00:17:49.590
No.

310
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.071
She even missed
#MondayMotivation.

311
00:17:54.682 --> 00:17:56.945
I think she's really upset.

312
00:17:59.774 --> 00:18:02.777
I'll be right back.
I got to make a phone call.

313
00:18:04.735 --> 00:18:08.348
I didn't realize you hadn't
spoken to her in months.

314
00:18:08.435 --> 00:18:09.740
Okay.

315
00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:12.787
Best of luck with school.
Destiny.

316
00:18:15.616 --> 00:18:18.009
Hi. It's Cheryl.

317
00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:22.231
Have you spoken to Lauren?
No. everything is good.

318
00:18:22.362 --> 00:18:25.626
Hi. It's Cheryl. Oh. you haven't
spoken to her in a few days.

319
00:18:25.756 --> 00:18:27.715
Yeah. we're--we're loving
the new town.

320
00:18:27.802 --> 00:18:30.065
Oh. you haven't spoken to her
in a day or two.

321
00:18:30.196 --> 00:18:31.980
Just having
a hard time reaching her.

322
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.657
Yeah?

323
00:18:56.787 --> 00:18:58.006
Who's this?

324
00:18:58.093 --> 00:18:59.486
Who's this?

325
00:18:59.573 --> 00:19:01.618
You called me.

326
00:19:01.705 --> 00:19:03.925
I'm Cheryl Baker.

327
00:19:04.055 --> 00:19:07.711
I-I found your number in
my daughter Lauren's call log.

328
00:19:07.798 --> 00:19:11.889
This is Eddie Brick. I manage
the coffee shop at Canning.

329
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.675
Where she works.

330
00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:15.676
Worked.

331
00:19:15.806 --> 00:19:17.678
What do you mean?

332
00:19:17.808 --> 00:19:19.854
She hasn't shown up
in a few days.

333
00:19:19.984 --> 00:19:22.770
In fact. if you talk to her.

334
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.208
let her know she doesn't
need to bother coming back.

335
00:19:26.339 --> 00:19:29.603
She's fired.

336
00:19:58.022 --> 00:20:00.895
Wait. why are we at Canning?

337
00:20:00.982 --> 00:20:03.463
I want to go check in on Lauren.
Stay in the car. okay?

338
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.204
Okay.

339
00:20:23.613 --> 00:20:25.093
Lauren. it's Mom!

340
00:20:29.706 --> 00:20:31.273
Lauren?

341
00:20:33.449 --> 00:20:35.843
Can I help you?

342
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:40.978
Hi. I'm Lauren's mom. I think
we met briefly at move-in day.

343
00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:42.153
Oh. right.

344
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:45.156
Um. I haven't been able
to reach her.

345
00:20:45.287 --> 00:20:47.028
Have you heard from her today?

346
00:20:47.158 --> 00:20:51.772
Uh...no. she hasn't been here
since I got back yesterday.

347
00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:53.817
I figured she was
still visiting home.

348
00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:00.128
Is everything okay?

349
00:21:04.306 --> 00:21:07.091
I think my daughter's missing.

350
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.927
Oh. we've been here all night.

351
00:21:17.058 --> 00:21:19.060
What are they looking for?

352
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.932
Any clue that will
tell us where Lauren went.

353
00:21:28.983 --> 00:21:30.463
Did you find anything?

354
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:31.899
Well. there's no signs
of forced entry.

355
00:21:31.986 --> 00:21:34.902
There's a bag missing
with some clothes.

356
00:21:34.989 --> 00:21:37.252
her computer. and her phone.

357
00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:39.776
Otherwise. it seems as if
your daughter left voluntarily.

358
00:21:39.863 --> 00:21:42.213
That doesn't make sense.

359
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:44.433
I mean. she would have
called us and let us know.

360
00:21:44.564 --> 00:21:47.175
and all of a sudden
her phone is off?

361
00:21:47.262 --> 00:21:50.352
Look. I've seen this before.
Students get overwhelmed.

362
00:21:50.439 --> 00:21:53.224
They skip out for a couple days.
and then they come back.

363
00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:54.574
Not my daughter.

364
00:21:54.704 --> 00:21:56.445
I mean. maybe other students.
but not my daughter.

365
00:21:56.576 --> 00:21:58.926
She wouldn't run away.
She wouldn't.

366
00:21:59.056 --> 00:22:00.710
Yeah. well. I spoke
with her roommate. Annie.

367
00:22:00.841 --> 00:22:02.146
who said
that your daughter has been

368
00:22:02.233 --> 00:22:06.020
exhibiting strange behavior
lately. been skipping school.

369
00:22:06.107 --> 00:22:08.327
Did you know that
about your daughter?

370
00:22:10.503 --> 00:22:11.939
No.

371
00:22:12.026 --> 00:22:14.289
-No.
-I wasn't aware.

372
00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:16.117
Look. I know this isn't easy
to hear.

373
00:22:16.204 --> 00:22:18.989
but there is no need to panic.

374
00:22:19.076 --> 00:22:20.339
Chances are
your daughter's going to show up

375
00:22:20.426 --> 00:22:21.949
in a couple days
in your doorstep

376
00:22:22.036 --> 00:22:23.472
with a bag of dirty laundry.

377
00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:25.431
So then what?

378
00:22:25.518 --> 00:22:27.433
Do we just wait to see if
my sister's actually missing?

379
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.043
I thought the first 48 hours

380
00:22:29.173 --> 00:22:31.306
are supposed to be
the most important.

381
00:22:31.437 --> 00:22:34.701
Marley. I'm sorry.
It's been a long night.

382
00:22:34.788 --> 00:22:37.268
Look. we put a BOLO
out on your sister. okay?

383
00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:39.662
If I hear anything.
I'll let you know.

384
00:22:39.749 --> 00:22:42.186
Thanks.

385
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.240
Hello?

386
00:23:39.374 --> 00:23:41.637
Okay. Well. you said previously
that Lauren

387
00:23:41.768 --> 00:23:43.683
was home for the weekend.
but she left early.

388
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.162
Why is that?

389
00:23:45.249 --> 00:23:48.688
We...had an argument.

390
00:23:48.818 --> 00:23:51.038
but she said she was heading
right back to school.

391
00:23:51.125 --> 00:23:53.823
Were you able to find out
if that's true?

392
00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.477
An argument.

393
00:23:55.564 --> 00:23:59.263
Um. yes. There is surveillance
footage of her leaving campus.

394
00:23:59.394 --> 00:24:03.746
Um. problem is. it goes cold
once she gets right off campus.

395
00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:07.184
Now. Lauren took both
her phone and her computer.

396
00:24:07.271 --> 00:24:11.537
Do you guys have passwords
or access to her social media?

397
00:24:11.624 --> 00:24:13.669
No.

398
00:24:13.756 --> 00:24:16.629
But you can subpoena
the social media companies

399
00:24:16.716 --> 00:24:17.934
to get her data. right?

400
00:24:18.021 --> 00:24:19.414
We can.

401
00:24:19.501 --> 00:24:21.938
It takes about two to four weeks
to ever hear back.

402
00:24:22.025 --> 00:24:23.723
and if there isn't
sufficient cause.

403
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.115
then we won't get it.

404
00:24:25.246 --> 00:24:26.421
And in this case.
there really isn't.

405
00:24:26.552 --> 00:24:31.731
Um...trying to do some
background on your daughter.

406
00:24:31.861 --> 00:24:35.865
Does she have any history
of prior disappearances...

407
00:24:35.996 --> 00:24:37.345
-No.
-...or drugs

408
00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:38.781
or any close cases?

409
00:24:38.912 --> 00:24:40.827
No! And--and--No.

410
00:24:40.914 --> 00:24:42.916
Detective.
are you trying to figure out

411
00:24:43.003 --> 00:24:46.833
if my daughter is a criminal
or if a crime occurred here?

412
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.835
I'm--I'm just trying to get
my facts straight. ma'am.

413
00:24:48.922 --> 00:24:49.836
That's it.

414
00:24:51.402 --> 00:24:53.535
Okay. well.
Ms. Baker. the truth is.

415
00:24:53.666 --> 00:24:55.276
we've got
no evidence of foul play.

416
00:24:55.406 --> 00:24:57.408
and Lauren is an adult.

417
00:24:58.845 --> 00:25:01.108
Detective. she's 18.

418
00:25:01.238 --> 00:25:04.111
And. um. she voluntarily
left her college campus.

419
00:25:04.241 --> 00:25:05.678
There's no crime there.

420
00:25:09.246 --> 00:25:11.466
What about. uh. a search party

421
00:25:11.553 --> 00:25:14.164
to check the woods
behind the college. or--

422
00:25:14.251 --> 00:25:18.342
That's a great idea. That's
been very effective in the past.

423
00:25:18.473 --> 00:25:20.867
Unfortunately. we don't
have the resources for that.

424
00:25:20.954 --> 00:25:22.869
But if you could get
some volunteers together.

425
00:25:22.999 --> 00:25:28.004
put up some flyers. get involved
in social media. be a huge help.

426
00:25:30.267 --> 00:25:31.921
Volunteers have spread out.

427
00:25:32.008 --> 00:25:33.096
- Jessica.
- Jessica Russo.

428
00:25:33.227 --> 00:25:35.664
As volunteers
from across the nation gather.

429
00:25:35.751 --> 00:25:38.362
the FBI now believes
that Jessica Russo

430
00:25:38.493 --> 00:25:42.453
may have been abducted
by a potential serial killer

431
00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:44.368
who is showing
a similar pattern of killings

432
00:25:44.455 --> 00:25:47.197
to the infamous serial killer
Ted Bundy.

433
00:25:47.284 --> 00:25:49.852
and that suspect is
believed to be responsible

434
00:25:49.939 --> 00:25:54.422
for three murders
across the Pacific Northwest.

435
00:26:18.315 --> 00:26:19.969
Lauren!

436
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.580
Lauren?!

437
00:26:25.496 --> 00:26:27.586
Lauren!

438
00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:32.416
Lauren!

439
00:26:33.983 --> 00:26:35.898
Lauren!

440
00:26:42.383 --> 00:26:44.298
It's Detective Dean.

441
00:26:44.385 --> 00:26:46.605
I'm unavailable right now.
Please leave a--

442
00:27:08.539 --> 00:27:11.673
I've been following this
Jessica Russo disappearance.

443
00:27:11.804 --> 00:27:13.806
but you just never think
it's actually going to be

444
00:27:13.936 --> 00:27:15.895
ever in your own backyard.

445
00:27:16.025 --> 00:27:20.856
I mean. I don't know.
They seem like nice family.

446
00:27:20.987 --> 00:27:25.687
Cheryl. we were
just saying how sorry we are

447
00:27:25.818 --> 00:27:28.211
that you have
to go through all of this.

448
00:27:28.342 --> 00:27:30.779
I made an announcement
at church.

449
00:27:30.866 --> 00:27:34.783
and everyone's praying
for Lauren.

450
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:36.698
Word's going to get out there.

451
00:27:36.785 --> 00:27:38.265
Excuse me.

452
00:27:38.352 --> 00:27:42.573
And when it does. I bet
that her face will be plastered

453
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:45.446
all over the TV screen
just like Jessica Russo's.

454
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:14.301
Cheryl?

455
00:28:14.388 --> 00:28:16.172
Are you okay?

456
00:28:27.009 --> 00:28:28.184
Next up.
I don't need to tell you.

457
00:28:28.315 --> 00:28:32.711
This Jessica Russo case
has been a ratings knockout.

458
00:28:32.798 --> 00:28:35.061
So as a result. no shocker.

459
00:28:35.148 --> 00:28:37.411
National wants every station
covering. running--

460
00:28:37.498 --> 00:28:38.804
Sorry. Sorry. Russ.

461
00:28:38.891 --> 00:28:43.678
Oh. excuse me.
Jessica. Jessica. Jessica 24/7.

462
00:28:43.809 --> 00:28:45.680
Too much is not enough.

463
00:28:45.767 --> 00:28:47.900
Elisa.
how kind of you to join us.

464
00:28:47.987 --> 00:28:49.815
Sorry.
A school drop-off is literally

465
00:28:49.945 --> 00:28:51.294
my ninth circle of hell.

466
00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:54.907
And it looks like you got
a little gift there as a bonus.

467
00:28:54.994 --> 00:28:57.170
Awesome.

468
00:28:57.257 --> 00:28:59.607
Next up.
the station has received

469
00:28:59.694 --> 00:29:01.870
approximately 35 calls

470
00:29:01.957 --> 00:29:04.307
from a local mom
whose daughter is MIA.

471
00:29:04.394 --> 00:29:06.005
How old is the kid?

472
00:29:06.092 --> 00:29:08.834
She's not a kid.
She's a student at Canning.

473
00:29:08.921 --> 00:29:10.836
Now. I've looked into this.
There's no story here.

474
00:29:10.923 --> 00:29:12.011
Plus. we've already
got our hands filled

475
00:29:12.141 --> 00:29:13.708
with one missing girl already.

476
00:29:13.795 --> 00:29:16.363
However.
some lucky winner here today

477
00:29:16.493 --> 00:29:20.584
is going to be the one to call
and let the mom down gently.

478
00:29:20.671 --> 00:29:24.588
Wow. So busy with your pad.

479
00:29:24.675 --> 00:29:26.677
Oh. these two.
solving world problems.

480
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:31.334
Nothing from them...
leaving Miss Punctual herself.

481
00:29:31.421 --> 00:29:34.555
Elisa.
will you do me the honor?

482
00:29:34.642 --> 00:29:36.470
-Sure.
-Thank you very much.

483
00:29:36.557 --> 00:29:38.341
All right. everybody.
get back to work. Come on.

484
00:29:38.428 --> 00:29:42.345
News waits for no one.

485
00:29:42.432 --> 00:29:45.871
So your daughter's been missing
just over a week?

486
00:29:45.958 --> 00:29:47.786
Yeah. and it's been a nightmare.

487
00:29:47.873 --> 00:29:49.700
I can't even get in touch
with the detective

488
00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:51.746
that's assigned to her case.

489
00:29:51.877 --> 00:29:53.226
I mean. the cops
called my sister a runaway.

490
00:29:53.313 --> 00:29:55.837
like that makes her
not worth their time.

491
00:29:55.924 --> 00:29:57.143
What can you tell me
about Lauren?

492
00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:00.146
Did she have any personal
problems leading up to this?

493
00:30:00.233 --> 00:30:03.062
My husband died last year.

494
00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:05.586
Coronary heart disease.

495
00:30:07.544 --> 00:30:10.069
His death has been tough
on the girls.

496
00:30:10.156 --> 00:30:13.333
Lauren has struggled in school.
She's acted out a bit.

497
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:17.903
but she has never
and would neverrun away.

498
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:21.689
I have to ask. considering what
your family has been through.

499
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.692
Did Lauren show any signs
of suicidal ideation?

500
00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:29.349
No. It could never
have gotten that bad. I...

501
00:30:29.436 --> 00:30:31.177
I would have seen something.

502
00:30:31.264 --> 00:30:33.353
Would you?

503
00:30:37.096 --> 00:30:38.706
You don't...

504
00:30:38.793 --> 00:30:40.969
You don't take a computer
if you're going to.

505
00:30:44.451 --> 00:30:48.977
My gut tells me
that my daughter is out there.

506
00:30:49.064 --> 00:30:51.197
I believe you.

507
00:30:51.284 --> 00:30:53.982
And we would be happy
to run Lauren's photo

508
00:30:54.069 --> 00:30:56.115
in the 5:00 local news roundup.

509
00:30:56.245 --> 00:30:58.508
That's it?
I thought you were taking notes

510
00:30:58.595 --> 00:31:00.423
to maybe do a story
or something.

511
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.730
No. it's to see if there is
a story.

512
00:31:02.817 --> 00:31:05.124
But look. if I'm being honest
with you. there--

513
00:31:05.211 --> 00:31:07.039
there's just not much here.

514
00:31:07.126 --> 00:31:09.171
The police--they found no signs
of forcible abduction.

515
00:31:09.258 --> 00:31:13.436
So until my daughter is
murdered. she's not newsworthy.

516
00:31:13.567 --> 00:31:17.701
Unless salient details emerge.
there is no story

517
00:31:17.832 --> 00:31:19.660
for me to report.

518
00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:22.402
Elisa. phone call.

519
00:31:22.489 --> 00:31:25.144
I am really sorry.

520
00:31:29.278 --> 00:31:32.151
Why does nobody care?

521
00:31:32.281 --> 00:31:34.153
We're going to find her.

522
00:31:44.119 --> 00:31:46.034
"Netsleuths.com.

523
00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:50.865
Netsleuths.
Amateur crime solvers"?

524
00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:02.050
"Please...help me

525
00:32:02.137 --> 00:32:05.358
find...my sister."

526
00:32:21.722 --> 00:32:23.811
Have you seen my daughter?

527
00:32:26.727 --> 00:32:28.555
Hey. guys.

528
00:32:28.642 --> 00:32:30.339
H-Have you seen...

529
00:32:30.426 --> 00:32:32.254
Have you seen my daughter?
Do you know Lauren?

530
00:32:32.385 --> 00:32:34.604
If you see her...

531
00:32:48.009 --> 00:32:50.272
Come on. Tina.

532
00:32:50.359 --> 00:32:52.274
Don't you want to
see a movie with me?

533
00:32:52.361 --> 00:32:54.624
Huh? Just one little
itty-bitty date?

534
00:32:54.755 --> 00:32:57.758
Just one casual date. huh?

535
00:32:59.412 --> 00:33:03.938
Welcome to Canning Café.
Hey. what can we get for you?

536
00:33:04.069 --> 00:33:07.942
I'm looking for information
about my daughter. Lauren Baker.

537
00:33:09.422 --> 00:33:11.337
Right. We--We spoke before.

538
00:33:11.424 --> 00:33:13.817
Look. I already told the cops
everything I know.

539
00:33:13.904 --> 00:33:15.080
Which is?

540
00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:17.038
Your daughter was
always showing up to work late.

541
00:33:17.125 --> 00:33:19.475
making up excuses.

542
00:33:19.562 --> 00:33:22.522
Then last week. she stopped
showing up altogether.

543
00:33:22.652 --> 00:33:24.132
Really screwed me
during rush hour.

544
00:33:27.048 --> 00:33:29.355
That eye looks pretty painful.

545
00:33:29.442 --> 00:33:31.705
Did you get in an accident?

546
00:33:31.792 --> 00:33:35.883
It's nothing. It fell.

547
00:33:38.538 --> 00:33:40.061
Hey there.

548
00:33:40.148 --> 00:33:42.498
Welcome to Canning Café.
Uh. look.

549
00:33:42.585 --> 00:33:45.980
I got to get back to work.
Hope Lauren turns up. okay?

550
00:33:58.036 --> 00:33:59.863
Um...

551
00:33:59.994 --> 00:34:01.604
Excuse me.

552
00:34:01.691 --> 00:34:05.173
Did you know Lauren?

553
00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.176
We were only work friends
or maybe...

554
00:34:08.306 --> 00:34:10.222
allies in the trenches.

555
00:34:10.309 --> 00:34:12.920
Hey. Tina. I need
a double caramel macchiato.

556
00:34:13.007 --> 00:34:15.226
like. today. please.

557
00:34:15.357 --> 00:34:17.141
He's off in 30 minutes

558
00:34:17.228 --> 00:34:18.839
if you want to meet outside.

559
00:34:18.926 --> 00:34:20.536
Yes.

560
00:34:20.623 --> 00:34:22.060
Thank you.

561
00:34:31.504 --> 00:34:34.898
-Mrs. Baker?
-Cheryl. Thanks for meeting me.

562
00:34:34.985 --> 00:34:37.292
Is it true no one's heard
from Lauren in over a week?

563
00:34:37.422 --> 00:34:40.904
Unfortunately. yes.

564
00:34:41.034 --> 00:34:42.601
You said you and Lauren
were allies in the trenches.

565
00:34:42.688 --> 00:34:44.603
What did you mean?

566
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:48.172
Uh...it means Eddie. our boss.
is a real jerk.

567
00:34:48.303 --> 00:34:51.132
especially if you have boobs.

568
00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:53.569
He harasses the girls?

569
00:34:53.656 --> 00:34:56.005
I guess technically.
it's harassment.

570
00:34:56.137 --> 00:34:57.834
I think of him more like

571
00:34:57.965 --> 00:35:00.185
a little fly buzzing
in your ear.

572
00:35:00.272 --> 00:35:03.101
It's annoying. but harmless.

573
00:35:04.754 --> 00:35:08.584
You think Eddie has something to
do with Lauren's disappearance?

574
00:35:08.671 --> 00:35:11.109
Maybe.
But turns out there's a lot

575
00:35:11.196 --> 00:35:14.677
about my daughter
that I didn't know.

576
00:35:14.764 --> 00:35:19.639
Truthfully. Eddie's a sleaze.
but he's all bark.

577
00:35:19.726 --> 00:35:23.121
I can't imagine
he would actually hurt someone.

578
00:35:23.208 --> 00:35:26.036
Thanks.

579
00:35:26.167 --> 00:35:28.430
There is one person you might
want to look into. though.

580
00:35:28.517 --> 00:35:31.912
Uh. a stuck-up roommate.
What's her name?

581
00:35:32.042 --> 00:35:34.044
-Annie?
-That's it.

582
00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:39.702
If I had to put money on
who might actually harm Lauren.

583
00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:42.879
It'd be Annie.

584
00:35:42.966 --> 00:35:44.577
Thanks.

585
00:35:54.891 --> 00:35:57.285
- Hi.
- I've left you a dozen messages.

586
00:35:57.372 --> 00:35:58.721
Yeah. I've been
meaning to call you.

587
00:35:58.808 --> 00:36:01.637
It's been
such a crazy news week.

588
00:36:01.768 --> 00:36:04.292
My daughter's news.
She's local news.

589
00:36:04.379 --> 00:36:06.903
Meanwhile. you have
round-the-clock coverage

590
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.905
of some girl lost in Oregon.

591
00:36:08.992 --> 00:36:12.474
National wants all affiliates
focused on Jessica Russo.

592
00:36:12.561 --> 00:36:14.563
Well.
while no one's making progress

593
00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:18.915
on my daughter's case.
I found two potential suspects.

594
00:36:19.046 --> 00:36:21.396
Did you bring this
to the police?

595
00:36:21.483 --> 00:36:25.052
Yeah. I tried. but they never
returned my calls.

596
00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:26.358
Eddie Brick.

597
00:36:26.445 --> 00:36:28.273
Lauren's coworker said
that he has a history

598
00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.971
of sexually harassing the girls
that work there.

599
00:36:31.101 --> 00:36:32.712
and when I spoke to him--

600
00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:35.280
Whoa. you spoke
to a possible suspect?

601
00:36:35.367 --> 00:36:36.890
That could be dangerous.

602
00:36:36.977 --> 00:36:38.674
My daughter is missing.
What should I do?

603
00:36:38.805 --> 00:36:40.807
Sit back and--and knit?

604
00:36:43.853 --> 00:36:49.511
Lauren's roommate. Annie Dolan.
According to the coworker.

605
00:36:49.598 --> 00:36:52.427
there's been
some bullying going on.

606
00:36:52.558 --> 00:36:55.169
Okay. Uh...

607
00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.345
Can you be more specific?

608
00:36:57.476 --> 00:37:00.696
Like. what kind of bullying
are we talking about?

609
00:37:00.827 --> 00:37:02.002
She didn't give me any details.

610
00:37:02.132 --> 00:37:05.048
but apparently the situation
has gotten really bad.

611
00:37:05.135 --> 00:37:07.137
Mrs. Baker.
I know that you think

612
00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:11.011
that I've been ignoring you.
but I-I did speak to the police.

613
00:37:12.752 --> 00:37:13.753
You did?

614
00:37:13.883 --> 00:37:15.798
Yes.

615
00:37:15.885 --> 00:37:18.714
And the statements that
Mr. Brick and Miss Dolan gave

616
00:37:18.801 --> 00:37:22.065
did not provoke any suspicion.

617
00:37:22.152 --> 00:37:23.458
Do you have proof
that your daughter

618
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:26.113
was being sexually harassed
and bullied?

619
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.462
No. but that shouldn't--

620
00:37:27.593 --> 00:37:31.510
I-I-I do want to help you.
I swear I do.

621
00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.600
But I cannot call people
suspects on live TV

622
00:37:34.687 --> 00:37:36.863
based on hearsay.

623
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.257
Does that make sense?

624
00:37:42.651 --> 00:37:44.392
Are you a mom?

625
00:37:45.741 --> 00:37:47.047
Yeah. Um...

626
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:52.574
This is....my son Gabriel.

627
00:37:52.661 --> 00:37:53.749
He's 6?

628
00:37:53.836 --> 00:37:56.361
Yeah. he just turned.
Good guess.

629
00:38:00.713 --> 00:38:05.108
For 20 years. I've watched
school drop-off and pick-up.

630
00:38:05.195 --> 00:38:08.895
from preschoolers
to high schoolers.

631
00:38:09.025 --> 00:38:11.767
You know the one thing
that never changes?

632
00:38:11.854 --> 00:38:13.856
The way a parent
looks at their child

633
00:38:13.943 --> 00:38:15.902
when they say goodbye.

634
00:38:19.384 --> 00:38:21.734
I haven't been able to eat.

635
00:38:21.864 --> 00:38:25.390
I haven't been able to sleep.

636
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:31.309
All I wonder is if I said
my last goodbye to my daughter.

637
00:38:33.746 --> 00:38:35.661
Cheryl. wait. Wait. um...

638
00:38:37.663 --> 00:38:41.841
As a journalist. there are
legal limits to what I can do.

639
00:38:41.928 --> 00:38:46.498
But speaking as...as a mom.

640
00:38:46.585 --> 00:38:49.239
I would...

641
00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:51.285
I would check out
her room again.

642
00:38:51.372 --> 00:38:53.200
You would be shocked
to see what good evidence

643
00:38:53.287 --> 00:38:54.984
just gets overlooked.

644
00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:47.863
Girl. I'm coming.

645
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:51.084
I just forgot something.

646
00:39:51.171 --> 00:39:54.827
What are you doing in here?
Is that my phone?

647
00:39:54.957 --> 00:39:56.872
What DMs don't you want
the police to know. Annie?

648
00:39:57.003 --> 00:40:00.267
I don't know what you're
talking about. Give me my phone!

649
00:40:02.965 --> 00:40:07.492
Whatever you did to my daughter.
I'm gonna find out.

650
00:40:20.243 --> 00:40:22.071
Annie is
clearly hiding something.

651
00:40:22.158 --> 00:40:24.334
We have to find those DMs

652
00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:25.858
that she doesn't want the cops
to see.

653
00:40:25.945 --> 00:40:29.252
I might have an idea.

654
00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:32.865
But...I don't think
you're going to like it.

655
00:40:35.084 --> 00:40:37.391
They're like amateur detectives
who gather online

656
00:40:37.478 --> 00:40:39.611
to solve crimes.

657
00:40:39.698 --> 00:40:40.960
Marley.
I don't think it's a good idea

658
00:40:41.047 --> 00:40:42.831
for you to be talking
to strangers.

659
00:40:42.918 --> 00:40:44.572
But this may be
our only chance of finding out

660
00:40:44.659 --> 00:40:46.618
what happened to Lauren.

661
00:40:46.748 --> 00:40:49.795
Look. they said this one girl.
um. Bella Holmes. 2008.

662
00:40:49.882 --> 00:40:52.014
is a tech whiz.

663
00:40:52.101 --> 00:40:55.975
Mom. she may be able
to help us find those DMs.

664
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:02.285
Let's ask them.

665
00:41:02.372 --> 00:41:04.331
Um. okay.

666
00:41:10.337 --> 00:41:12.078
I have to admit.

667
00:41:12.165 --> 00:41:15.951
I wasn't expecting
a 16-year-old tech quiz.

668
00:41:16.038 --> 00:41:17.518
I know what you're thinking.

669
00:41:17.649 --> 00:41:20.347
but I've helped solve seven
different cases on Netsleuths.

670
00:41:20.434 --> 00:41:22.349
You mentioned
that you might be able to hack

671
00:41:22.436 --> 00:41:24.699
into Lauren's
social media accounts?

672
00:41:24.786 --> 00:41:27.006
Hopefully. but you say you don't
have any physical access

673
00:41:27.136 --> 00:41:28.790
to her devices. right?

674
00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:30.096
-No.
-Mm-mm.

675
00:41:30.226 --> 00:41:33.273
Lauren took them with her.
and her phone's shut off.

676
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.058
I can't remotely access a device
that's been turned off.

677
00:41:36.145 --> 00:41:40.410
so we guess. Most passwords
follow a simple format--

678
00:41:40.498 --> 00:41:42.543
a word or phrase.
first letter capitalized.

679
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.806
a 2- or 3-digit number
at the end.

680
00:41:44.893 --> 00:41:48.506
First. you should make a list of
all of Lauren's favorite things.

681
00:41:48.593 --> 00:41:50.464
Hey. guys.
it's your girl. Lauren.

682
00:41:50.551 --> 00:41:53.249
And today. I'm naming
my top five favorite hairstyles.

683
00:41:53.336 --> 00:41:55.643
Her favorite movies.

684
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.079
Her favorite number was eight.

685
00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:59.517
Then you should check
if there are any likely pairs

686
00:41:59.604 --> 00:42:00.735
between the phrases
and numbers.

687
00:42:00.866 --> 00:42:04.565
This is where it sort of
becomes a gut instinct.

688
00:42:04.696 --> 00:42:07.263
What does Lauren
really care about?

689
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:09.178
I mean. there could be

690
00:42:09.265 --> 00:42:11.224
a thousand different
combinations for that.

691
00:42:11.311 --> 00:42:12.486
Yeah. I mean.
her favorite color is yellow.

692
00:42:12.617 --> 00:42:15.968
I mean. it could take weeks
to write everything down.

693
00:42:16.098 --> 00:42:17.752
It could be thousands of 'em.

694
00:42:17.883 --> 00:42:19.275
Except we only get
three guesses.

695
00:42:19.362 --> 00:42:21.495
Three?

696
00:42:21.582 --> 00:42:23.715
Marley's right.
Most social media sites

697
00:42:23.802 --> 00:42:26.848
lock you out for 24 hours
after three wrong guesses.

698
00:42:26.979 --> 00:42:29.155
and you could get permanently
locked out after that.

699
00:42:29.285 --> 00:42:31.244
-Okay.
-Okay.

700
00:42:41.297 --> 00:42:44.344
Damn. Try the next one.

701
00:42:44.431 --> 00:42:46.564
Should we do her favorite color?

702
00:42:46.651 --> 00:42:48.130
-O-Okay.
-Okay.

703
00:42:48.217 --> 00:42:49.654
I'll try it.

704
00:42:51.873 --> 00:42:53.048
Damn.

705
00:42:53.135 --> 00:42:55.964
-Hey.
-You said it first.

706
00:42:56.095 --> 00:42:58.358
One last left.

707
00:42:58.445 --> 00:43:00.665
Okay. go for it.

708
00:43:02.928 --> 00:43:04.407
What?

709
00:43:04.494 --> 00:43:06.540
Bella said we should
go with our instinct.

710
00:43:06.671 --> 00:43:09.499
and I just...
I feel like this one isn't it.

711
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:11.980
Hold on.

712
00:43:15.331 --> 00:43:17.029
Ooh. you and dad only liked
Sweet Rose

713
00:43:17.159 --> 00:43:19.248
because they had that gross
pickle-flavored ice cream.

714
00:43:19.335 --> 00:43:21.207
What was it called?

715
00:43:21.337 --> 00:43:24.384
Number 23. The Big Dill.

716
00:43:27.735 --> 00:43:30.390
Oh. my God. It worked!

717
00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.521
Worked.

718
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:36.091
Mom. these must have been
the DMs

719
00:43:36.178 --> 00:43:39.051
that Annie was trying to hide.

720
00:43:39.138 --> 00:43:41.619
"Nobody wants you here"?

721
00:43:41.706 --> 00:43:44.534
"I wish you were dead"?

722
00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:46.885
Mom.

723
00:43:46.972 --> 00:43:49.931
Will you print--print
this conversation. please?

724
00:43:54.196 --> 00:43:55.545
Well. it's not
in my jurisdiction.

725
00:43:55.633 --> 00:43:58.853
so. you know.
my hands are tied.

726
00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.115
Detective.

727
00:44:01.421 --> 00:44:02.596
Detective?

728
00:44:02.683 --> 00:44:04.424
Oh. Ms. Baker.

729
00:44:04.511 --> 00:44:06.034
You need to question
Annie Dolan.

730
00:44:06.121 --> 00:44:07.557
Who?

731
00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:10.212
Lauren?
My daughter's roommate.

732
00:44:10.299 --> 00:44:12.693
Oh. yeah. we did.
We took her statement.

733
00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.087
Like I said before.
no evidence of foul play.

734
00:44:15.174 --> 00:44:16.175
Well. Annie has been

735
00:44:16.262 --> 00:44:18.220
cyberbullying my daughter
for months.

736
00:44:18.307 --> 00:44:21.049
including messages
with direct physical threat.

737
00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.095
How'd you get these?

738
00:44:23.225 --> 00:44:25.532
We gained access to her account.

739
00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:29.231
I need someone to take
my daughter's case seriously.

740
00:44:29.362 --> 00:44:33.105
Detective.
I need you to do more.

741
00:44:43.637 --> 00:44:46.292
Those look familiar to you?

742
00:44:46.379 --> 00:44:48.120
The coincidence I'm finding

743
00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:51.514
is that you spent months
cyberbullying Lauren.

744
00:44:51.601 --> 00:44:54.039
and then she disappeared.

745
00:44:54.126 --> 00:44:55.649
I had nothing to do
with Lauren disappearing.

746
00:44:55.736 --> 00:45:00.262
I-I wasn't even here
that weekend.

747
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:03.831
Look. I swear on my life.
I swear on everything.

748
00:45:03.962 --> 00:45:06.486
I-I don't know
what happened to Lauren.

749
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:17.497
-Elisa. hi.
-Hey.

750
00:45:17.584 --> 00:45:21.414
Um. So I spoke with BVPD.
and I wanted to make sure

751
00:45:21.501 --> 00:45:23.155
that you heard
as soon as possible.

752
00:45:23.242 --> 00:45:24.983
Detective Dean--
he re-interviewed Annie.

753
00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:26.811
and her alibi checks out.

754
00:45:26.898 --> 00:45:28.638
She was at some
fancy ski resort.

755
00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:30.118
She wasn't even in the state

756
00:45:30.205 --> 00:45:31.424
at the time
of Lauren's disappearance.

757
00:45:37.299 --> 00:45:39.258
What about the manager--Eddie?

758
00:45:39.345 --> 00:45:40.607
Mr. Brick?

759
00:45:40.694 --> 00:45:43.828
He. uh. apparently spent
the night in a drunk tank.

760
00:45:43.915 --> 00:45:46.874
He got handsy at a strip club.
Bouncer roughed him up.

761
00:45:46.961 --> 00:45:49.224
So that explains the black eye.

762
00:45:49.355 --> 00:45:52.053
He is a sleazeball. and he
should definitely be fired.

763
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.142
But. you know.
it's highly unlikely

764
00:45:54.229 --> 00:45:56.666
that he or Annie were involved
in Lauren's disappearance.

765
00:45:56.754 --> 00:45:58.320
So I'm back to the beginning

766
00:45:58.407 --> 00:46:01.541
and nowhere closer
to finding where my daughter is.

767
00:46:01.628 --> 00:46:04.544
I really am sorry. Mrs. Baker.

768
00:46:04.674 --> 00:46:07.286
I wish I had better news.

769
00:46:10.376 --> 00:46:12.900
Thank you.

770
00:46:13.031 --> 00:46:16.164
-Lauren!
-Lauren!

771
00:46:16.295 --> 00:46:18.036
Lauren!

772
00:46:18.123 --> 00:46:20.603
Lauren?!

773
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:21.779
Lauren!

774
00:46:21.866 --> 00:46:22.780
Lauren!

775
00:46:22.867 --> 00:46:25.521
Cheryl...

776
00:46:25.608 --> 00:46:27.741
it is getting awfully late.

777
00:46:27.828 --> 00:46:30.091
I think we have to
call it for the night.

778
00:46:30.178 --> 00:46:34.661
Susan. thank you for coming.
Okay? You can go home.

779
00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:36.445
No. no. no. No way.

780
00:46:36.532 --> 00:46:40.101
Hey. you haven't slept
in almost two weeks.

781
00:46:40.188 --> 00:46:42.974
-Just call it for tonight.
-I can't.

782
00:46:43.104 --> 00:46:45.933
I can't. My daughter
told me she was depressed.

783
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.849
and I was too afraid to listen.

784
00:46:48.936 --> 00:46:50.895
-What if she came out here to--
-Hey.

785
00:46:50.982 --> 00:46:55.551
If you feel it in your gut.
Lauren is still out there.

786
00:46:55.638 --> 00:46:57.945
Just stop for the night.

787
00:46:58.032 --> 00:46:59.642
Susan...

788
00:46:59.729 --> 00:47:02.776
please go home.

789
00:47:02.907 --> 00:47:05.126
-Go home.
-Okay.

790
00:47:05.213 --> 00:47:08.477
Lauren!

791
00:47:10.523 --> 00:47:12.742
Lauren!

792
00:47:12.873 --> 00:47:15.658
Lauren?!

793
00:47:15.745 --> 00:47:18.618
-Lauren!
-Lauren?

794
00:47:18.748 --> 00:47:20.315
-Lauren!
-Lauren!

795
00:47:20.402 --> 00:47:22.448
Lauren!

796
00:47:57.222 --> 00:47:59.659
Annie?

797
00:47:59.746 --> 00:48:01.530
Annie? Annie!

798
00:48:01.617 --> 00:48:03.532
Leave me alone!

799
00:48:03.619 --> 00:48:06.318
Annie. I just
want to talk to you!

800
00:48:09.625 --> 00:48:12.541
Annie...
I just need a minute.

801
00:48:12.628 --> 00:48:14.892
Please.

802
00:48:14.979 --> 00:48:16.763
Annie--

803
00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:19.287
I'm not supposed to speak
to you. I'll call the cops.

804
00:48:19.374 --> 00:48:22.377
I believe you weren't involved
in Lauren's disappearance.

805
00:48:22.464 --> 00:48:24.292
Then why are you following me?

806
00:48:24.379 --> 00:48:27.774
I just want to understand what
was going on with my daughter.

807
00:48:29.123 --> 00:48:31.909
Can we just
take one minute to talk?

808
00:48:34.302 --> 00:48:36.435
After the first few months.

809
00:48:36.522 --> 00:48:38.741
Lauren got
really moody and quiet.

810
00:48:38.828 --> 00:48:42.397
She was always in our room.
buried in her phone or computer.

811
00:48:42.484 --> 00:48:45.270
And I take it
that was a problem for you?

812
00:48:45.357 --> 00:48:46.662
Yeah. It got so annoying
'cause I couldn't have

813
00:48:46.749 --> 00:48:48.969
any friends over or guys

814
00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.103
'cause she was just like this
gloomy cloud. constantly there.

815
00:48:56.672 --> 00:48:58.631
I mean. looking back.
it should have been obvious

816
00:48:58.761 --> 00:49:00.415
that she was just
super depressed.

817
00:49:03.375 --> 00:49:04.942
I missed it. too.

818
00:49:08.858 --> 00:49:12.079
I'm so sorry. Mrs. Baker.

819
00:49:12.166 --> 00:49:15.604
I know you probably
can't forgive me. but...

820
00:49:15.691 --> 00:49:18.085
I really do hope
that Lauren is okay.

821
00:49:19.826 --> 00:49:21.697
You're right.

822
00:49:21.784 --> 00:49:25.919
I can't forgive you for
the way you treated my daughter.

823
00:49:26.006 --> 00:49:28.313
but maybe now you can help us.

824
00:49:28.443 --> 00:49:30.228
How?

825
00:49:30.358 --> 00:49:31.794
Maybe there's
something you didn't think of

826
00:49:31.881 --> 00:49:33.927
that's actually useful.

827
00:49:34.058 --> 00:49:36.582
I mean. is there anyone

828
00:49:36.669 --> 00:49:39.933
that you think Lauren could have
gone out to meet that night?

829
00:49:40.064 --> 00:49:42.980
Well. she really
didn't have any friends.

830
00:49:45.112 --> 00:49:49.116
What about...
a professor or a crush?

831
00:49:51.205 --> 00:49:53.120
Well. there was this one guy.

832
00:49:53.207 --> 00:49:55.470
Who? Was he a student?

833
00:49:55.601 --> 00:49:58.343
No. no. I think Lauren met him
on a dating site or something.

834
00:49:58.473 --> 00:50:01.781
Crap.
What was his name? Brian?

835
00:50:04.566 --> 00:50:07.308
Ian. That was it.

836
00:50:12.183 --> 00:50:13.532
Ian.

837
00:50:18.928 --> 00:50:20.017
Marley!

838
00:50:20.104 --> 00:50:22.671
Mom. Finally. you're back.

839
00:50:22.802 --> 00:50:25.109
-We found an Ian.
-Already?

840
00:50:25.196 --> 00:50:26.458
The Sleuths found this guy
who'd been commenting

841
00:50:26.545 --> 00:50:29.330
on all of Lauren's picks on this
dating site called Yearning.

842
00:50:29.417 --> 00:50:31.941
until his account
mysteriously deactivated

843
00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:34.770
the day
after Lauren disappeared.

844
00:50:34.901 --> 00:50:35.902
Look.

845
00:50:39.079 --> 00:50:40.820
Have you and the Sleuths
found anything else

846
00:50:40.907 --> 00:50:43.562
on Ian Turner?
-Not yet.

847
00:50:43.692 --> 00:50:45.825
The main problem is that his
IP address is based in Latvia.

848
00:50:45.912 --> 00:50:48.828
Latvia?
That's thousands of miles away.

849
00:50:48.915 --> 00:50:50.177
That can't be the right person.

850
00:50:50.308 --> 00:50:52.745
He's probably using a VPN
to cover his real location.

851
00:50:52.875 --> 00:50:55.835
He could actually
just be down the street.

852
00:50:55.922 --> 00:50:57.967
Well. that's sus.

853
00:50:58.098 --> 00:51:01.275
Are there any private messages
on the site?

854
00:51:01.362 --> 00:51:04.278
Yes. but try logging in
with Lauren's IG password.

855
00:51:04.409 --> 00:51:05.584
You'd be surprised
how many people

856
00:51:05.671 --> 00:51:07.455
use the same one for everything.
Total hacker bait.

857
00:51:07.542 --> 00:51:10.067
Okay.

858
00:51:12.939 --> 00:51:13.983
Got it.

859
00:51:14.114 --> 00:51:15.507
Um...

860
00:51:15.637 --> 00:51:18.118
-No sign of Ian.
-No.

861
00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:20.120
But if he deactivated
his account.

862
00:51:20.251 --> 00:51:22.079
his messages
would have erased. right?

863
00:51:22.209 --> 00:51:23.950
Right. but there's a trick.

864
00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:25.691
Try downloading
Lauren's account data.

865
00:51:25.821 --> 00:51:28.520
Even deleted messages
should appear in the archive.

866
00:51:28.607 --> 00:51:32.089
There it is.

867
00:51:34.265 --> 00:51:36.658
"I feel so lonely here.

868
00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:40.445
You're the only one
who understands me"?

869
00:51:44.057 --> 00:51:45.406
Looks like Ian was supposed

870
00:51:45.493 --> 00:51:47.930
to pick up Lauren at Crowley.

871
00:51:48.017 --> 00:51:50.019
That's right behind
the woods in Canning.

872
00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:53.240
So that means
that she didleave on her own.

873
00:51:53.327 --> 00:51:55.764
Yeah. but it looks like she
wasn't supposed to be staying.

874
00:51:55.895 --> 00:51:57.288
-It says a few days.
-Right.

875
00:51:57.375 --> 00:52:00.247
But that still doesn't explain
why her phone is turned off.

876
00:52:00.378 --> 00:52:01.988
Or the fact that her debit card

877
00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:03.511
hasn't been used
in almost two weeks.

878
00:52:03.598 --> 00:52:04.599
Exactly.

879
00:52:04.686 --> 00:52:08.299
-We can find this guy. Mom.
-Yeah.

880
00:52:08.386 --> 00:52:11.737
It's just like you said.
If we find Ian...

881
00:52:11.824 --> 00:52:14.000
We find Lauren.

882
00:52:16.263 --> 00:52:18.309
Imagine being Jessica's mom.

883
00:52:18.439 --> 00:52:21.442
How frustrated would you be?
I mean. in my opinion.

884
00:52:21.529 --> 00:52:23.575
I feel like we're seeing this
way too often...

885
00:52:23.662 --> 00:52:25.490
I reverse-searched
the logo on his shirt.

886
00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:27.405
It's from Record Outlet.
a town over.

887
00:52:27.535 --> 00:52:28.580
Is that how you found out where
Ian worked?

888
00:52:28.667 --> 00:52:30.190
Obviously...

889
00:52:30.277 --> 00:52:32.714
Sort of. They don't sell
the shirt online.

890
00:52:32.845 --> 00:52:35.456
so I figured
he has to be an employee.

891
00:52:35.587 --> 00:52:36.675
But don't think
it's happening. It's been--

892
00:52:36.805 --> 00:52:38.503
Good job. Detective Marley.

893
00:52:38.633 --> 00:52:39.547
Okay.

894
00:52:45.074 --> 00:52:47.686
...Jessica.
but this is a cold case. and...

895
00:53:31.991 --> 00:53:34.036
Excuse me.

896
00:53:34.123 --> 00:53:37.953
I'm. uh. looking for an album
for my--my husband.

897
00:53:38.084 --> 00:53:40.782
Teddy Pendergrass.
The "TP" album?

898
00:53:40.869 --> 00:53:44.133
Well...
this is our R&B section.

899
00:53:44.264 --> 00:53:45.657
We also have
another R&B section in the back.

900
00:53:45.744 --> 00:53:48.964
Uh...

901
00:53:49.095 --> 00:53:50.792
You look familiar.
What's your name?

902
00:53:50.923 --> 00:53:54.318
Charlie.

903
00:53:55.928 --> 00:53:57.843
Are you a student
at Canning College?

904
00:53:57.930 --> 00:54:00.889
No. UT alum. actually.

905
00:54:00.976 --> 00:54:02.717
Do you work at Canning?

906
00:54:02.848 --> 00:54:06.721
My daughter is a student there.

907
00:54:06.852 --> 00:54:08.636
Her name's Lauren.

908
00:54:08.767 --> 00:54:11.160
Awesome.

909
00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:16.557
Anyways. if you need anything.
you let me know.

910
00:54:16.688 --> 00:54:19.821
Uh. Charlie. is it? Um...

911
00:54:19.952 --> 00:54:22.955
Do you recognize
the name Ian Turner?

912
00:54:23.042 --> 00:54:25.436
No. sorry.

913
00:54:35.968 --> 00:54:37.491
Where'd you get this?

914
00:54:37.622 --> 00:54:40.102
I think someone's using
your picture to. uh.

915
00:54:40.189 --> 00:54:42.844
catfish some young women
on the Internet.

916
00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:48.154
I had nothing to do with this.
I swear.

917
00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:50.504
Do you know anybody
who would do this?

918
00:54:50.635 --> 00:54:52.376
Do you remember anybody
taking your picture?

919
00:54:52.463 --> 00:54:55.117
Has anybody been in here
that's been suspicious?

920
00:54:55.248 --> 00:54:57.859
I don't know. I...I'm sorry.

921
00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:01.776
If I could help you more.
I-I would.

922
00:55:01.863 --> 00:55:03.474
But I will file a police report.

923
00:55:07.434 --> 00:55:09.044
Elisa. you got the lead-in
for the mayoral debate for me?

924
00:55:09.131 --> 00:55:10.176
Uh. yeah. almost.
Sorry. I'm just--

925
00:55:10.263 --> 00:55:12.483
I'm running a little bit behind.
-What is that?

926
00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.226
Missing Persons Database?

927
00:55:17.357 --> 00:55:19.141
Is this about
the Baker girl again?

928
00:55:19.228 --> 00:55:20.795
I think
there's a story here. Russ.

929
00:55:20.882 --> 00:55:24.146
No. One girl went missing
in a whole town of problems.

930
00:55:24.277 --> 00:55:25.452
and there are no viable leads.

931
00:55:25.539 --> 00:55:27.498
Elisa. move on.

932
00:55:27.628 --> 00:55:30.022
But it is not just one girl.

933
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:31.676
Russ. Russ. look at this.
Look at this.

934
00:55:31.806 --> 00:55:32.981
Half a dozen
Black and Brown women

935
00:55:33.112 --> 00:55:34.809
between the ages of 18 and 30--

936
00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:38.335
they've gone missing in
this area in the last two years.

937
00:55:39.858 --> 00:55:41.512
Half a dozen.

938
00:55:44.732 --> 00:55:48.867
So...what. do you think
we have a serial killer?

939
00:55:48.954 --> 00:55:52.610
Yes.
and/or multiple systemic issues

940
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.090
that are failing these women--
these women--

941
00:55:55.221 --> 00:55:56.962
these women of color.

942
00:55:57.092 --> 00:55:58.529
And with the cops.

943
00:55:58.659 --> 00:56:00.574
they--they obviously don't
take these cases seriously.

944
00:56:00.661 --> 00:56:02.141
Look. Elisa.

945
00:56:02.228 --> 00:56:04.622
I know how much you care about
this case. but I don't have to

946
00:56:04.709 --> 00:56:07.407
remind you how much national
is focused on Jessica Russo.

947
00:56:07.494 --> 00:56:09.278
But if we spoke to national
and we told them--

948
00:56:09.366 --> 00:56:11.193
You don't think I've tried?

949
00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:15.110
Dozens of newsworthy stories
cross my desk each week--

950
00:56:15.197 --> 00:56:19.201
stories like this one
that deserve attention.

951
00:56:19.288 --> 00:56:22.291
But you know news isn't news
anymore. It's ratings.

952
00:56:22.422 --> 00:56:23.771
And the public goes nuts

953
00:56:23.858 --> 00:56:27.993
for a pretty little blonde girl
like Jessica. I'm sorry.

954
00:56:28.123 --> 00:56:31.649
And no one cares
about a missing Black girl.

955
00:56:44.575 --> 00:56:46.272
Elisa.

956
00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:50.929
We were just coming to see you.

957
00:56:51.016 --> 00:56:53.105
-Now is not a good time. I'm--
-No. but we found out who Lauren

958
00:56:53.235 --> 00:56:54.759
went to see
the night she disappeared.

959
00:56:54.889 --> 00:56:56.804
Then you should go
to the police. Okay?

960
00:56:56.935 --> 00:56:58.197
We already called
Detective Dean.

961
00:56:58.327 --> 00:56:59.764
and we got his voicemail again.

962
00:56:59.851 --> 00:57:01.635
Elisa. we need your help.

963
00:57:01.722 --> 00:57:03.158
I thought
you understood as a mom.

964
00:57:03.245 --> 00:57:07.119
You are not the only people
in Blue Valley who need help.

965
00:57:07.206 --> 00:57:08.599
All right?

966
00:57:11.166 --> 00:57:13.952
Listen. I...I understand
that the authorities--

967
00:57:14.039 --> 00:57:17.782
they are not moving as quickly
as you would like. but please.

968
00:57:17.912 --> 00:57:19.566
Be patient.

969
00:57:19.653 --> 00:57:21.133
If you guys go rogue. you could

970
00:57:21.263 --> 00:57:23.352
jeopardize
the entire investigation.

971
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.529
What investigation?

972
00:57:31.143 --> 00:57:35.539
I'm really sorry
that I couldn't help more.

973
00:57:37.279 --> 00:57:38.846
We are not
going to listen to her.

974
00:57:38.933 --> 00:57:40.631
No.

975
00:57:53.774 --> 00:57:55.907
My uncle's on the force.

976
00:57:56.037 --> 00:57:58.170
Cops don't ever think
they'll find that Baker girl.

977
00:58:00.433 --> 00:58:02.479
Shut up. Josh.

978
00:58:04.959 --> 00:58:06.352
Make me.

979
00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:17.232
Oh! Aah!

980
00:58:17.319 --> 00:58:18.799
Yo. what the hell?!

981
00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:21.062
-Aah!
-Are you okay?

982
00:58:21.149 --> 00:58:23.630
No. I'm not okay!

983
00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:28.853
Oh. my eyes.

984
00:58:36.382 --> 00:58:37.949
You can't let
your emotions control you.

985
00:58:38.079 --> 00:58:40.125
God. you are
so obsessed with being polite

986
00:58:40.212 --> 00:58:41.518
and perfect all the time.

987
00:58:41.648 --> 00:58:43.520
That's why
you ignore glaring realities

988
00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:45.739
like Lauren was depressed
for months. Mom.

989
00:58:45.826 --> 00:58:47.915
-That's not fair--
-Excuse me.

990
00:58:48.046 --> 00:58:51.223
Sorry.
Am I interrupting family hour?

991
00:58:51.353 --> 00:58:54.008
Well. we have good news on Josh.

992
00:58:54.139 --> 00:58:57.229
Apparently. the liquid
that Marley threw in his face

993
00:58:57.359 --> 00:58:59.753
is nothing more
than sodium chloride.

994
00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.147
which is
another word for salt water.

995
00:59:02.234 --> 00:59:04.279
Nurse says Josh
is going to be just fine.

996
00:59:04.366 --> 00:59:07.631
I'm glad he's going to be okay.
Marley is truly sorry.

997
00:59:07.761 --> 00:59:09.894
and I can assure you
this will not happen again.

998
00:59:10.024 --> 00:59:12.331
Yes. well.
I guess a 2-week suspension

999
00:59:12.461 --> 00:59:14.376
will help that message sink in.

1000
00:59:14.463 --> 00:59:17.336
Two weeks? For spraying him
with salt water?

1001
00:59:17.466 --> 00:59:21.427
Marley. what you did technically
counts as an assault. Okay?

1002
00:59:21.514 --> 00:59:23.385
You're lucky the parents
aren't pressing charges.

1003
00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:26.563
Fine.

1004
00:59:30.915 --> 00:59:33.091
A 2-week suspension is going to
go on her record permanently.

1005
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:36.094
You don't think
that's a little harsh.

1006
00:59:36.224 --> 00:59:38.313
considering the--
the circumstances?

1007
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.925
Cheryl. I'm sorry.
but I can't make exceptions

1008
00:59:41.012 --> 00:59:42.579
for a kid just 'cause
they're having troubles at home.

1009
00:59:42.709 --> 00:59:44.319
Well. you didn't mind
making exceptions

1010
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:46.539
when I reported Josh's behavior.

1011
00:59:46.626 --> 00:59:47.758
That was
a different circumstance.

1012
00:59:47.888 --> 00:59:52.284
Why? Because he's white.
and my daughter is Black?

1013
00:59:52.371 --> 00:59:54.286
Cheryl. I can assure you. okay.

1014
00:59:54.416 --> 00:59:56.897
I make all of
my disciplinary decisions

1015
00:59:57.028 --> 00:59:59.770
on a strictly colorblind basis.

1016
00:59:59.857 --> 01:00:01.423
Okay. all right. all right.
all right. all right.

1017
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:04.078
What about--what about
if we--if we made it

1018
01:00:04.165 --> 01:00:06.864
a detention instead?
Then we give her a week.

1019
01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:07.995
That way.
Marley still learns her lesson.

1020
01:00:08.126 --> 01:00:10.171
and--and nothing goes
on her permanent record.

1021
01:00:10.302 --> 01:00:13.087
We could do that.

1022
01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:17.614
-Thank you.
-Okay.

1023
01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:24.055
I'm so glad your dad
let you come over.

1024
01:00:24.142 --> 01:00:26.884
I cannot find another profile
with Ian Turner.

1025
01:00:26.971 --> 01:00:28.494
I swear. I have carpal tunnel
from swiping.

1026
01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:30.975
Swipe no more.

1027
01:00:31.105 --> 01:00:33.194
I created a bot
that'll trawl your name.

1028
01:00:33.281 --> 01:00:36.067
If Ian's using a different
profile. this will find him.

1029
01:00:36.154 --> 01:00:38.156
Whoa. Girl. it is so cool

1030
01:00:38.286 --> 01:00:40.637
that you know
how to do all this stuff.

1031
01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:43.161
Yeah. well. I was a loser
in residence in my school.

1032
01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:44.728
It's not like I'm busy
getting invited

1033
01:00:44.858 --> 01:00:46.643
to football games or keggers.

1034
01:00:49.297 --> 01:00:51.256
Hey.
wanna see something funny?

1035
01:00:51.343 --> 01:00:52.910
The BVH football team?

1036
01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.825
Drumroll. please.

1037
01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:56.391
Oh. my God.

1038
01:00:56.478 --> 01:00:59.003
-You hacked our school website?
-"Hacked" is such a strong word.

1039
01:00:59.133 --> 01:01:00.961
I just took
a few lines of code.

1040
01:01:01.048 --> 01:01:04.922
Aw. I kind of like
baby body Josh.

1041
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.361
Wait. I think I found him.

1042
01:01:09.491 --> 01:01:11.232
Ian Turner?

1043
01:01:11.363 --> 01:01:13.495
Well. on this profile.
he goes by Robert Gregory.

1044
01:01:13.626 --> 01:01:15.889
but it's the same photo.
same location.

1045
01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:19.806
Holy shit. Bella.
that has to be the catfish.

1046
01:01:19.937 --> 01:01:21.242
But what do we do?
I can't make my own account.

1047
01:01:21.373 --> 01:01:22.896
He'll recognize my name.

1048
01:01:23.027 --> 01:01:26.030
No. you got
to create a fake profile.

1049
01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.423
Something this creep
will be into.

1050
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:29.686
Someone like Lauren.

1051
01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.425
"Black and Missing Foundation."

1052
01:02:19.997 --> 01:02:25.045
Yes.
I'd like to speak to...Loretta.

1053
01:02:33.053 --> 01:02:34.098
Oh. my God.

1054
01:03:21.145 --> 01:03:21.754
Cheryl.

1055
01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:23.277
Loretta.

1056
01:03:23.364 --> 01:03:26.150
Give me a hug. Oh. Mm.

1057
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.108
Thank you for coming so quickly.

1058
01:03:28.195 --> 01:03:29.980
Oh. I'm not far. and besides.

1059
01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:31.242
that's
Black and Missing's motto--

1060
01:03:31.372 --> 01:03:33.984
"Help Us Find Us."

1061
01:03:34.114 --> 01:03:36.813
I'm so sorry your family's
going through this.

1062
01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:40.425
How have you been holding up?

1063
01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:43.210
Just...barely.

1064
01:03:43.297 --> 01:03:45.125
If I didn't have Marley
to take care of.

1065
01:03:45.212 --> 01:03:46.605
I don't know
what else I would do.

1066
01:03:46.692 --> 01:03:48.607
Oh. that's why I'm here.

1067
01:03:48.737 --> 01:03:50.957
So. have you thought about
doing any community events.

1068
01:03:51.088 --> 01:03:54.700
like maybe a candlelight vigil?

1069
01:03:54.787 --> 01:03:56.920
I mean. we're new in town.

1070
01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:58.312
I mean. I don't know
how much of a community

1071
01:03:58.443 --> 01:04:00.010
there is that would show up.

1072
01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.839
I mean.
when Lauren went missing.

1073
01:04:02.926 --> 01:04:05.363
I just hoped that there'd be
detectives combing the streets

1074
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:09.889
and her picture would be
on every news channel.

1075
01:04:09.976 --> 01:04:12.849
But now I know what the world
thinks of my daughter.

1076
01:04:12.979 --> 01:04:15.199
She's just another statistic.

1077
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:19.943
That's a lot of heaviness
you're holding in.

1078
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:22.859
You got anybody you can
talk to about these feelings?

1079
01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:25.774
It used to be my husband.

1080
01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:28.908
but now I don't want to
burden people with my problems.

1081
01:04:28.995 --> 01:04:31.258
What about a professional?

1082
01:04:31.389 --> 01:04:34.566
You mean...a shrink?

1083
01:04:34.653 --> 01:04:38.309
Trauma like your family's
been through. it cuts deep.

1084
01:04:38.439 --> 01:04:41.312
If you broke your leg. you would
go see a doctor. right?

1085
01:04:41.442 --> 01:04:44.924
Yeah. but I respect that
therapy works for other people.

1086
01:04:45.011 --> 01:04:47.927
but that's not how
I handle my problems.

1087
01:04:48.014 --> 01:04:50.321
I hear you. You know.
my mother used to say.

1088
01:04:50.451 --> 01:04:54.238
"All you need is prayer
and some gumption."

1089
01:04:54.325 --> 01:04:58.416
Keep your head down low
and push through your pain.

1090
01:04:58.546 --> 01:05:00.679
But. you know.
times have changed.

1091
01:05:00.766 --> 01:05:04.161
It is not a sign of weakness
to admit that you need help.

1092
01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:08.817
That takes strength.
especially from folks like us.

1093
01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.297
I don't know.
Sitting in a chair

1094
01:05:10.384 --> 01:05:13.605
whining about my feelings is not
going to bring my daughter home.

1095
01:05:13.692 --> 01:05:17.130
Cheryl. this fight is
going to stretch and pull you

1096
01:05:17.217 --> 01:05:18.610
to your limit.

1097
01:05:18.697 --> 01:05:21.221
You got to take care
of yourself. too.

1098
01:05:21.308 --> 01:05:23.310
You won't do
your daughter any good

1099
01:05:23.397 --> 01:05:25.573
if you're
broken up into pieces.

1100
01:05:56.735 --> 01:05:59.477
"Where...do...you...live?"

1101
01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:03.829
Come on.
Say something.

1102
01:06:05.787 --> 01:06:07.311
Why isn't he answering?

1103
01:06:09.356 --> 01:06:11.315
Hey. honey.
I brought your favorite cookies.

1104
01:06:11.402 --> 01:06:13.795
-You're supposed to knock. Mom.
-What are you doing?

1105
01:06:13.882 --> 01:06:16.581
-Nothing. Just homework.
-Then just show me.

1106
01:06:16.668 --> 01:06:18.365
Mom. it's literally nothing.

1107
01:06:18.452 --> 01:06:20.454
Marley.
show me what you're doing.

1108
01:06:20.541 --> 01:06:23.414
-It's just homework.
-Well. I want to see it.

1109
01:06:23.501 --> 01:06:25.068
Show it to me.

1110
01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:34.729
That's...Ian.
I-I mean. Charlie.

1111
01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.036
How long have you been
messaging him?

1112
01:06:37.123 --> 01:06:39.256
It's only been a few days.

1113
01:06:39.343 --> 01:06:42.128
It was going well until...
I don't know.

1114
01:06:42.259 --> 01:06:44.043
I asked him where he lived.
and he stopped responding.

1115
01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:48.134
I told you to stand down.
Are you kidding?

1116
01:06:48.265 --> 01:06:51.442
This could hurt your sister.
Marley. why don't you listen?

1117
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:54.053
-Anything could happen now!
-I was just trying to help.

1118
01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.708
You're not helping.
That's not helping!

1119
01:07:27.956 --> 01:07:29.523
Mom?

1120
01:07:30.785 --> 01:07:32.309
Marley.

1121
01:07:33.571 --> 01:07:34.789
Hi.

1122
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.965
Mom...

1123
01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:40.534
I'll never forgive myself if--
if I got Lauren...

1124
01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:45.887
-You didn't.
-You said...

1125
01:07:45.974 --> 01:07:48.107
You said--You said I did.

1126
01:07:48.238 --> 01:07:49.543
I was angry.

1127
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:51.850
And I'm scared.

1128
01:07:51.937 --> 01:07:54.635
I'm so sorry I said those things
to Principal Shepherd about you.

1129
01:07:54.722 --> 01:07:55.854
I never meant any of them.

1130
01:07:55.984 --> 01:07:56.768
-Yeah. you did.
-No. I don't think that. though.

1131
01:07:56.855 --> 01:07:58.552
Yeah. you do.

1132
01:07:58.639 --> 01:08:00.772
I get it.

1133
01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:06.865
When I was your age.
I had to fight for everything.

1134
01:08:06.952 --> 01:08:08.519
And I thought
the only way I could do it

1135
01:08:08.649 --> 01:08:11.478
is by being...perfect.

1136
01:08:11.609 --> 01:08:14.742
And I know--I know I'm hard
on you and your sister. but...

1137
01:08:16.613 --> 01:08:20.226
It's just because
I see so much potential in you.

1138
01:08:20.313 --> 01:08:23.011
So I'm sorry.

1139
01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:25.405
You don't have to be sorry. Mom.

1140
01:08:53.825 --> 01:08:58.743
I so appreciate you guys
coming out and supporting.

1141
01:09:00.265 --> 01:09:02.398
I thought more people
would come.

1142
01:09:02.529 --> 01:09:04.227
It's still early.

1143
01:09:04.314 --> 01:09:08.100
So what's
with the police presence?

1144
01:09:08.187 --> 01:09:09.580
Oh. pay them no mind.

1145
01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:12.712
If they were doing their jobs.
we wouldn't have to be here.

1146
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.149
-Right?
-Right.

1147
01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:15.368
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1148
01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:18.458
And here we are.

1149
01:09:18.545 --> 01:09:20.112
When the road is long...

1150
01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:22.636
When the road is long...

1151
01:09:22.723 --> 01:09:24.943
- Look.
- ...standing strong.

1152
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:27.119
When we walk together...

1153
01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:28.685
When we walk together...

1154
01:09:28.816 --> 01:09:31.078
- ...we hold on together.
- ...we hold on together.

1155
01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:33.211
When we fight together...

1156
01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:34.431
When we fight together...

1157
01:09:34.518 --> 01:09:35.867
...we keep standing strong.

1158
01:09:35.996 --> 01:09:37.260
...we keep standing strong.

1159
01:09:37.389 --> 01:09:38.696
We keep standing strong.

1160
01:09:38.782 --> 01:09:39.871
We keep standing strong.

1161
01:09:40.001 --> 01:09:41.481
We keep standing strong!

1162
01:09:41.612 --> 01:09:42.916
We keep standing strong!

1163
01:09:43.004 --> 01:09:44.309
When the night is dark...

1164
01:09:44.397 --> 01:09:45.181
When the night is dark...

1165
01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:46.356
...we will shine our light!

1166
01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:47.966
...we will shine our light!

1167
01:09:48.053 --> 01:09:49.488
When the road is long...

1168
01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.012
When the road is long...

1169
01:09:51.143 --> 01:09:53.145
-...we will keep stepping on!
-...we will keep stepping on.

1170
01:09:53.232 --> 01:09:55.278
-We need you. Lord!
-We need you. Lord!

1171
01:09:55.365 --> 01:09:57.932
-We need you. Lord!
-We need you. Lord!

1172
01:09:58.063 --> 01:10:00.326
-When the road is long...
-When the road is long...

1173
01:10:00.413 --> 01:10:03.155
-...we will keep stepping on.
-...we will keep stepping on.

1174
01:10:03.286 --> 01:10:05.505
-When the night is dark...
-When the night is dark...

1175
01:10:05.592 --> 01:10:08.594
-...we will shine our light.
-...we will shine our light.

1176
01:10:08.682 --> 01:10:12.032
-We will keep standing strong!
-We will keep standing strong!

1177
01:10:16.864 --> 01:10:18.996
Mrs. Baker?
I'm Pastor Lewis Cartwell.

1178
01:10:19.084 --> 01:10:20.389
Hi.

1179
01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.306
We heard about this
from social media.

1180
01:10:23.436 --> 01:10:25.264
and this congregation
drove in from Oklahoma

1181
01:10:25.395 --> 01:10:26.874
just to support you.

1182
01:10:27.005 --> 01:10:31.749
You all came all the way from
there for us?

1183
01:10:31.879 --> 01:10:34.447
The youth group
even made posters.

1184
01:10:34.534 --> 01:10:37.014
Bless you. Pastor.

1185
01:10:37.145 --> 01:10:39.059
You're not alone.

1186
01:10:39.147 --> 01:10:41.585
Are you ready. Miss Marley?

1187
01:10:51.072 --> 01:10:52.987
Hi. everybody. Um...

1188
01:10:54.641 --> 01:10:56.513
Hi. everybody.

1189
01:10:56.643 --> 01:10:58.602
My name is Marley Baker.

1190
01:10:58.689 --> 01:11:01.518
Lauren Baker's my sister.

1191
01:11:01.648 --> 01:11:03.868
My big sister. actually.

1192
01:11:03.998 --> 01:11:07.871
She is two years. eight months
and 20 days older than me.

1193
01:11:08.002 --> 01:11:11.397
which she always reminded me.

1194
01:11:13.094 --> 01:11:15.793
Lauren is so sweet.

1195
01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.883
She cried at the end of every
Christmas movie...

1196
01:11:19.013 --> 01:11:20.841
even the funny ones.

1197
01:11:20.928 --> 01:11:23.975
She loved ranch.
but she hated mayonnaise.

1198
01:11:24.062 --> 01:11:27.630
And Lauryn Hill
was her one true queen.

1199
01:11:27.761 --> 01:11:31.416
My big sister is
the most caring. sweet.

1200
01:11:31.548 --> 01:11:33.505
creative.
beautiful girl that I know.

1201
01:11:33.593 --> 01:11:36.901
And. um...

1202
01:11:36.987 --> 01:11:38.598
I just thought
that I would let you all know

1203
01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:41.035
a little bit about her. too.

1204
01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:42.994
Thank you.

1205
01:11:52.003 --> 01:11:54.919
I'm Lauren's mom.

1206
01:11:58.401 --> 01:12:01.795
My daughter
has been missing for 16 days.

1207
01:12:03.884 --> 01:12:07.018
And ever since...

1208
01:12:07.148 --> 01:12:10.848
I've been living
every parent's nightmare.

1209
01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:16.419
We didn't feel heard.

1210
01:12:16.549 --> 01:12:18.377
We didn't feel seen...

1211
01:12:20.814 --> 01:12:22.076
...until now.

1212
01:12:22.163 --> 01:12:27.778
And I want to thank
every single one of you here.

1213
01:12:27.907 --> 01:12:32.173
And I just want to say that...

1214
01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:34.698
I miss my baby.

1215
01:12:37.178 --> 01:12:39.005
None of this
would have been possible

1216
01:12:39.093 --> 01:12:43.010
without the Black and Missing
Foundation.

1217
01:12:43.097 --> 01:12:47.188
I would like to introduce you
to Ms. Loretta Nix.

1218
01:13:00.941 --> 01:13:01.855
Hello. everyone.

1219
01:13:01.986 --> 01:13:04.815
My name is Loretta.

1220
01:13:04.945 --> 01:13:09.428
And we're going to do a little
call and response. okay?

1221
01:13:09.514 --> 01:13:11.735
And we gonna make sure
that this whole nation

1222
01:13:11.822 --> 01:13:13.954
hears our voices.

1223
01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:18.306
All I need y'all to say is.
"Do more."

1224
01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:19.395
We can...

1225
01:13:19.482 --> 01:13:20.874
Do more.

1226
01:13:21.005 --> 01:13:22.398
We will...

1227
01:13:22.485 --> 01:13:23.181
Do more.

1228
01:13:23.268 --> 01:13:25.662
- We must...
- Do more.

1229
01:13:25.749 --> 01:13:27.272
They can...

1230
01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.925
Do more.

1231
01:13:29.013 --> 01:13:30.754
- They will...
- Do more.

1232
01:13:30.884 --> 01:13:32.103
They must...

1233
01:13:32.233 --> 01:13:33.147
Do more.

1234
01:13:33.234 --> 01:13:34.452
-Do more.
-Do more.

1235
01:13:34.584 --> 01:13:36.193
-Do more.
-Do more.

1236
01:13:36.324 --> 01:13:37.804
-Do more.
-Do more.

1237
01:13:37.934 --> 01:13:39.153
-Do more!
-Do more!

1238
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.459
-Do more!
-Do more!

1239
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:42.635
-Do more!
-Do more!

1240
01:13:42.766 --> 01:13:44.463
-Do more!
-Do more!

1241
01:13:44.594 --> 01:13:45.550
-Do more!
-Do more!

1242
01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:48.075
-Do more!
-Do more!

1243
01:13:53.907 --> 01:13:55.996
Mom!

1244
01:13:56.083 --> 01:13:58.912
I'm coming.

1245
01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:03.308
The station finally agreed
to run our story.

1246
01:14:03.395 --> 01:14:05.353
Our coverage continues
with breaking news

1247
01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:06.442
about a missing girl.
-It's on.

1248
01:14:06.529 --> 01:14:07.878
-I can't believe it's happening.
-I know.

1249
01:14:07.965 --> 01:14:09.835
The search is over.

1250
01:14:09.967 --> 01:14:12.621
Jessica Russo
has been found alive.

1251
01:14:12.752 --> 01:14:15.929
Wait. what?
What about Lauren?

1252
01:14:16.059 --> 01:14:18.844
It is the outcome.
of course. everyone hoped for.

1253
01:14:18.932 --> 01:14:22.240
However. there is now
a shocking new twist.

1254
01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:27.157
Authorities now believe Jessica

1255
01:14:27.288 --> 01:14:29.246
may have been
a voluntary runaway.

1256
01:14:31.815 --> 01:14:33.294
She just ran away.

1257
01:14:36.428 --> 01:14:39.823
I promise you. Cheryl.
I-I fought my ass off

1258
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:44.305
to give Lauren the coverage
that she deserves. but...

1259
01:14:44.392 --> 01:14:47.700
you know. then the pretty little
blonde girl was found. so...

1260
01:14:47.831 --> 01:14:50.398
Oh. my God.
Can you believe that no one

1261
01:14:50.529 --> 01:14:53.924
thought to consider
that frickin' Jessica Russo

1262
01:14:54.054 --> 01:14:55.534
might be a runaway?

1263
01:14:55.621 --> 01:14:58.189
I'm not surprised.

1264
01:14:58.276 --> 01:15:02.628
Cheryl. I can only imagine
what you're feeling right now.

1265
01:15:02.715 --> 01:15:05.588
but I beg you.
don't do anything reckless.

1266
01:15:05.675 --> 01:15:08.373
Like. trying to find Ian Turner
can be really dangerous. okay?

1267
01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.505
Tell me somethin'.

1268
01:15:10.593 --> 01:15:13.465
What would you do
if that was yourchild?

1269
01:15:13.552 --> 01:15:16.860
I. um...

1270
01:16:02.035 --> 01:16:04.298
How should I respond to Ian?

1271
01:16:04.385 --> 01:16:06.996
Tell him you want
to set up a date.

1272
01:16:07.127 --> 01:16:08.737
-Really?
-Yes.

1273
01:16:08.825 --> 01:16:12.219
-For when?
-Today. in a public place.

1274
01:16:12.306 --> 01:16:14.178
And I'll stake out the location.

1275
01:16:14.308 --> 01:16:16.572
-I'll come as backup.
-No!

1276
01:16:16.659 --> 01:16:19.400
No. I already have
one daughter in jeopardy.

1277
01:16:19.531 --> 01:16:22.882
Promise me you will not
leave this house. Promise me.

1278
01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:26.538
I promise.

1279
01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:32.936
It's time we finally figure out
who this catfish really is.

1280
01:16:39.812 --> 01:16:41.597
Are you sure this is the place?

1281
01:16:41.684 --> 01:16:43.032
Yeah. He said he'd pick
"Kiyanah" up

1282
01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.687
for a date right here.

1283
01:16:44.773 --> 01:16:48.081
There's nothing out here.
He must have known that.

1284
01:16:48.212 --> 01:16:49.561
Easier to hide his trail?

1285
01:16:49.648 --> 01:16:52.216
Yep. that's what I'm thinkin'.

1286
01:16:52.346 --> 01:16:54.740
I mean. I do see a truck.

1287
01:16:54.871 --> 01:16:58.135
I mean. that's gotta be him.
It's a red truck.

1288
01:16:58.222 --> 01:17:00.093
Let me give you
the license plate.

1289
01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:05.403
DE7-C541.

1290
01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:13.846
NetSleuth94 says

1291
01:17:13.933 --> 01:17:15.674
that this plate was registered
as stolen.

1292
01:17:15.761 --> 01:17:17.545
and it belongs to a sedan.

1293
01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:20.026
Not a truck?

1294
01:17:20.157 --> 01:17:22.638
-No.
-Okay. but it must be him.

1295
01:17:22.768 --> 01:17:23.900
I'm going to try
and get a picture of him.

1296
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:25.597
Damn it! He just left.

1297
01:17:25.684 --> 01:17:27.468
Okay. I'm going.

1298
01:17:27.555 --> 01:17:28.600
No. Mom. Are you following him?

1299
01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:29.818
-Call the cops.
-That wasn't a part of the plan.

1300
01:17:29.906 --> 01:17:31.603
Call the cops.

1301
01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:35.737
Mom. Mom! Mom!

1302
01:18:13.732 --> 01:18:15.516
Blue Valley Police Department.

1303
01:18:15.647 --> 01:18:19.041
Detective Dean. please.
It's urgent.

1304
01:18:51.901 --> 01:18:53.816
Did the phishing link work?

1305
01:18:53.946 --> 01:18:55.731
Yes. he clicked it.

1306
01:18:55.861 --> 01:18:58.168
Now we should be able
to access his real IP address

1307
01:18:58.255 --> 01:18:59.517
and his location.

1308
01:20:12.155 --> 01:20:15.723
Lauren.

1309
01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:20.293
Lauren.
Lauren. baby. it's Mom.

1310
01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.992
Oh. Lauren.

1311
01:20:45.231 --> 01:20:46.710
Come on. baby.

1312
01:20:52.978 --> 01:20:55.154
I got you.

1313
01:21:07.601 --> 01:21:08.907
Lauren. run!

1314
01:21:09.038 --> 01:21:11.431
Aah! Get off of me!

1315
01:21:11.562 --> 01:21:13.303
Help!

1316
01:21:13.389 --> 01:21:15.044
Help!

1317
01:21:16.654 --> 01:21:19.612
Aah!

1318
01:21:23.008 --> 01:21:24.835
Hi. You've reached Cheryl.
I can't come to the--

1319
01:21:30.362 --> 01:21:31.495
Uhh!

1320
01:21:45.465 --> 01:21:47.684
Lauren.

1321
01:21:47.772 --> 01:21:49.817
Baby.

1322
01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:53.517
Lauren. Come on. baby.

1323
01:22:00.175 --> 01:22:01.612
Oh. gosh.

1324
01:22:07.357 --> 01:22:09.925
Put your hands up!

1325
01:22:10.012 --> 01:22:12.666
You're under arrest for
the abduction of Lauren Baker!

1326
01:22:12.753 --> 01:22:17.236
Get on your knees!
Put your hands behind your back.

1327
01:22:21.719 --> 01:22:24.156
It's okay.

1328
01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:29.161
Take him upstairs.

1329
01:22:31.598 --> 01:22:34.253
Lauren. you all right?

1330
01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:37.561
You okay? Let's get you guys
inside. okay?

1331
01:22:49.746 --> 01:22:51.662
Ow.

1332
01:22:51.749 --> 01:22:56.232
We are deeply relieved to have
Lauren back home.

1333
01:22:56.362 --> 01:22:57.885
Is that right?

1334
01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:03.500
Mom. you got this. okay?
You've been prepping all week.

1335
01:23:06.285 --> 01:23:10.637
Seriously. you've studied harder
than Peanut before a big exam.

1336
01:23:13.291 --> 01:23:15.468
Baby. if you don't want me
to do this interview

1337
01:23:15.555 --> 01:23:17.166
and you're not ready.
I don't have to.

1338
01:23:17.253 --> 01:23:22.998
It's okay.
Talked to my therapist about it.

1339
01:23:23.085 --> 01:23:25.434
I want people
to know what happened.

1340
01:23:27.219 --> 01:23:32.181
I am so proud
of the young woman you are.

1341
01:23:34.139 --> 01:23:36.054
And you. too.

1342
01:23:39.231 --> 01:23:40.493
I love my girls.

1343
01:23:40.624 --> 01:23:43.757
We love you. too.

1344
01:23:43.844 --> 01:23:45.977
Thank you for joining us today.
We have a special guest.

1345
01:23:46.108 --> 01:23:48.240
Her name is Cheryl Baker.

1346
01:23:48.327 --> 01:23:50.373
She is the mother
of Lauren Baker.

1347
01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:53.550
a young girl
who was recently abducted.

1348
01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.508
You've since learned
that your daughter

1349
01:23:55.594 --> 01:23:58.207
was not an isolated incident.

1350
01:23:58.294 --> 01:24:01.818
In fact. your efforts
thwarted a serial predator?

1351
01:24:01.949 --> 01:24:03.734
-That's correct. Mary.
-Mm-hmm.

1352
01:24:03.821 --> 01:24:06.911
The police now believe
that Lauren's abductor

1353
01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:08.695
may have been responsible
for the disappearance of

1354
01:24:08.782 --> 01:24:12.482
six other young women
in our area.

1355
01:24:12.568 --> 01:24:16.877
So why do you feel like Lauren
was the one that got out alive?

1356
01:24:16.964 --> 01:24:18.357
Lauren comes
from a family of means.

1357
01:24:18.443 --> 01:24:19.793
Mm-hmm.

1358
01:24:19.924 --> 01:24:22.100
The other victims
were poor Black

1359
01:24:22.187 --> 01:24:25.495
and Brown women
on the margin of society.

1360
01:24:25.582 --> 01:24:27.714
I mean. he didn't pick
those women by accident.

1361
01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.760
Hey. Russ.
Russ. check it out.

1362
01:24:29.847 --> 01:24:31.196
But he made a big mistake

1363
01:24:31.282 --> 01:24:32.893
underestimating
how far we would go

1364
01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:34.678
to get Lauren's back.

1365
01:24:34.764 --> 01:24:36.201
- Is that. uh...
- Yeah. he sure did.

1366
01:24:36.288 --> 01:24:37.681
-Yeah.
-Well. Cheryl. tell me this.

1367
01:24:37.768 --> 01:24:40.597
Now that Lauren's abductor
is facing a life in prison.

1368
01:24:40.684 --> 01:24:42.990
do you feel like
you and your family

1369
01:24:43.077 --> 01:24:46.255
are finally getting justice?

1370
01:24:46.342 --> 01:24:47.778
-Justice?
-Mm-hmm.

1371
01:24:50.041 --> 01:24:53.088
Mary. I assume

1372
01:24:53.218 --> 01:24:56.482
you're familiar
with JonBenét Ramsey.

1373
01:24:56.568 --> 01:24:58.267
Natalee Holloway.
Gabby Petito.

1374

Of course.

1375
01:24:59.659 --> 01:25:02.053
What about Relisha Rudd?

1376
01:25:02.139 --> 01:25:05.839
Uh...no.
Unfortunately. I don't know.

1377
01:25:05.925 --> 01:25:07.972
Relisha Rudd was
a little Black girl

1378
01:25:08.059 --> 01:25:12.889
who went missing in D.C.
March 1. 2014.

1379
01:25:12.977 --> 01:25:15.022
-She's still missing.
-Hmm.

1380
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:18.156
And there's so many more...

1381
01:25:18.287 --> 01:25:22.726
