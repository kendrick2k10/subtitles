00:00:29.447 --> 00:00:31.449
Hah. I'm still winning.

4
00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.959
I'd give up now because you are never
going to beat...

5
00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:43.502
- You sure?
- Hey!

6
00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:53.930
How's it feel to lose to your daughter?

7
00:00:54.472 --> 00:00:56.641
It's not over yet.

8
00:00:57.683 --> 00:01:00.228
Sorry.
I can't hear you from first place.

9
00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:01.895
Isaid...

10
00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:03.146
Wait. what's that?

11
00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:05.816
Cheating! That's cheating.

12
00:01:06.234 --> 00:01:07.944
Can't hear you from first place.

13
00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:25.711
Ha-ha!

14
00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:30.466
General alura zor ei.
high defender of Krypton. has lost!

15
00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.219
Park computer. activate bench.

16
00:01:34.637 --> 00:01:36.097
Yes!

17
00:01:36.222 --> 00:01:40.017
Kara zor ei. beloved daughter
and crowd favorite has won!

18
00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:41.894
Park computer. water.

19
00:01:41.978 --> 00:01:45.273
Didn't anyone teach you not to gloat?

20
00:01:45.815 --> 00:01:49.735
I mean. the woman in charge
of that lesson also cheats. so...

21
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.073
Your form has gotten better.

22
00:01:54.824 --> 00:01:56.158
You've been practicing.

23
00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:58.703
Every morning.
You're welcome to tag along.

24
00:01:58.786 --> 00:01:59.787
I'm a gracious winner.

25
00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.122
I could give you pointers.

26
00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:05.668
Believe me. if I could join you instead
of dealing with

27
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:08.129
the science council every morning.
I would.

28
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.089
And the guild and...

29
00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:13.426
I know. I know.
You've got all ofargo city to oversee

30
00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:14.844
and no time to do it in.

31
00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:16.344
It's just...

32
00:02:16.554 --> 00:02:19.181
It'd be nice to see you more.
you know?

33
00:02:25.813 --> 00:02:26.813
Hey.

34
00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:29.650
If it's important to you.
then I'll make time.

35
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.902
You come first.

36
00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:34.030
- Really?
- Always. my Kara.

37
00:02:34.447 --> 00:02:35.447
Always.

38
00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.162
Besides. I'm not the only one
about to be busy.

39
00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:42.955
Please tell me this isn't a ploy

40
00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.499
to get me to watch
uncle jor El's new baby again.

41
00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:48.586
I swear. that kid puts
everything in his mouth.

42
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:52.715
I... is this...

43
00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:55.926
Does this mean my application
to the guild's been...

44
00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:57.469
Accepted.

45
00:02:58.012 --> 00:03:01.974
Kara zor El. you have officially
been assigned to the military guild.

46
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.101
Welcome to the ranks. cadet.

47
00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:06.437
You've more than earned this.

48
00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:12.025
What is that?

49
00:03:17.073 --> 00:03:18.073
No!

50
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.201
Not now.

51
00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:32.128
Come on!

52
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.859
Computer. begin activation sequence.
code "in-ze."

53
00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:56.529
- What's going on?
- Jor El warned me this was coming.

54
00:03:56.612 --> 00:03:58.572
He told the science council
that they had to act.

55
00:03:58.656 --> 00:04:00.908
but they wouldn't listen.
They never listen!

56
00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:05.663
It's too late for Krypton.
but not for argo city.

57
00:04:05.955 --> 00:04:09.583
I've been building hyper-sleep escape
pods based off jor El's prototype.

58
00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:12.628
The council was against him.
so I've had to do this in secret.

59
00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.756
It's why I've been
gone so much. I just...

60
00:04:16.424 --> 00:04:18.467
I just thought we'd have
more time to finish.

61
00:04:19.135 --> 00:04:22.096
We can get everybody out?
Well. that's great. right?

62
00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.149
Activation failure.

63
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.856
Activation failure. Activation failure.

64
00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:35.359
- Activation failure.
- No!

65
00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.278
Work. damn you. work!

66
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.738
I tried. jory...

67
00:04:40.072 --> 00:04:41.699
I just needed more time to finish them.

68
00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:42.825
Mom.

69
00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:44.076
I tried.

70
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.662
Activation success.

71
00:05:09.143 --> 00:05:11.020
I am so proud of you.

72
00:05:15.024 --> 00:05:21.947
Every day. I am in awe of the strong.
kind. wonderful person you've become.

73
00:05:22.615 --> 00:05:26.452
And I am so lucky to be your mother.

74
00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:48.057
Find your cousin and know
that I will always love you. Kara.

75
00:05:48.724 --> 00:05:50.684
What are you doing?

76
00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:52.478
Mom! No. please!

77
00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:55.189
Mom. please don't do this!
What are you doing? Mom!

78
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.644
Okay. You can do this. Kara.

79
00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:40.854
Mall computer. map.

80
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:45.776
Mall computer. map.

81
00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.946
Map! Map!

82
00:08:55.494 --> 00:08:57.788
How do you locate uniforms
in the supply depot?

83
00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:05.504
Oh.

84
00:09:05.713 --> 00:09:08.132
Great. Yes. thanks.

85
00:09:12.136 --> 00:09:14.388
Mall. bring up...

86
00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:20.769
What a weirdo.

87
00:09:20.853 --> 00:09:22.104
Can you believe that?

88
00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:23.856
Talk about anger issues.

89
00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:30.155
What was that? Oh. no!

90
00:09:41.874 --> 00:09:45.836
Solomon grundy. born on a Monday!

91
00:09:52.176 --> 00:09:55.304
Destroyed Metropolis on a Tuesday!

92
00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:58.307
Killed Superman right now.

93
00:09:59.183 --> 00:10:02.561
Where are you. Superman?

94
00:10:03.479 --> 00:10:06.523
Grundy wants to play!

95
00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.985
You do know
grundy and Monday don't rhyme. right?

96
00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:12.988
Also. I'm going to take you down.

97
00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:16.867
You're not Superman.

98
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.410
I'm Supergirl.

99
00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:20.746
Remember the name.
'cause you're...

100
00:11:19.388 --> 00:11:21.640
You're no Superman.

101
00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:28.564
You're not anything. girlie!

102
00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:07.436
I'm fine. kal.

103
00:12:12.274 --> 00:12:13.317
We need to talk.

104
00:12:22.618 --> 00:12:23.618
Hey!

105
00:12:23.869 --> 00:12:26.038
No need to worry. citizen of Metropolis.

106
00:12:26.455 --> 00:12:29.166
- Solomon grundy has been...
- My apartment building!

107
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:30.500
It... you...

108
00:12:30.918 --> 00:12:32.127
Look what you've done!

109
00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.796
Uh. I saved it. You're welcome.

110
00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:37.049
You destroyed it!

111
00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:39.676
Just have your robot servants
build you a better place.

112
00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:42.179
Or government-issued robots.

113
00:12:43.472 --> 00:12:44.556
Construction robots?

114
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.141
Regular robots.

115
00:12:46.892 --> 00:12:47.893
Any robots?

116
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.438
What kind of weird hellscape
are you from?

117
00:12:51.772 --> 00:12:52.814
Krypton is...

118
00:12:53.357 --> 00:12:55.901
Was great.
Not like your backwards planet.

119
00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:57.277
Backwards?

120
00:12:57.361 --> 00:13:00.405
Uh. you live in homes made
out of aluminum and hot sand.

121
00:13:00.489 --> 00:13:01.799
Not anymore. thanks to you!

122
00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:03.635
- Your cousin is a problem.
- You should be thanking me!

123
00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:05.619
- I just saved you!
- You said we could trust her.

124
00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:07.203
We can.

125
00:13:07.496 --> 00:13:09.122
She's only been here a couple of months.

126
00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:10.791
She's doing her best.

127
00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:12.626
It's not good enough.

128
00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.461
What's that supposed to mean?

129
00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:17.923
You were so happy to meet someone
alive from Krypton.

130
00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:20.175
you didn't stop to think about
the consequences

131
00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:21.885
for the rest of us mere humans.

132
00:13:22.386 --> 00:13:24.656
In the short time she's been here.
she's destroyed buildings

133
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.515
and failed to control her powers.

134
00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:28.976
Worse. she doesn't care.

135
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.062
With her abilities.
that makes her a threat.

136
00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.190
I don't like what you're implying.

137
00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:44.281
Kara...

138
00:14:21.153 --> 00:14:22.654
Sorry. got held up in star city

139
00:14:22.738 --> 00:14:24.573
and didn't get the call
until a second ago.

140
00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.200
Hey. where's Superman?

141
00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:30.203
Taking care of a problem.

142
00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:31.788
I'm more worried about this.

143
00:14:32.998 --> 00:14:35.000
Grundy was using it in his rampage.

144
00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.502
Wait. Solomon grundy?

145
00:14:37.878 --> 00:14:40.338
The guy who thinks
grundy and Monday rhyme?

146
00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:44.259
There's no way he could build
something this complex.

147
00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:20.420
You know. this is where I used to go

148
00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:22.589
whenever I had a bad day.

149
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.556
I'd sit here as a kid
and look at the stars. and...

150
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.393
Little by little. my problems
would just seem less ovennhelming.

151
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.940
Were any of your problems.
"Batman is kicking me off the planet?"

152
00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:45.529
Not exactly. but I'm pretty sure that's
just because I didn't know him then.

153
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.700
Kara. I can't imagine
what you're going through.

154
00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:54.412
Having to adjust
to a new planet. new powers.

155
00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:55.789
getting knocked off course.

156
00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.208
and arriving decades
after you were supposed to.

157
00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.628
Finding out your baby cousin
isn't so little anymore.

158
00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:06.133
All I'm asking is that
you be more careful.

159
00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:08.260
and to give earth a chance.

160
00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:09.970
Kal. I'm trying.

161
00:16:10.053 --> 00:16:11.179
I swear.

162
00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:16.643
It's just all so primitive and weird
and wrong and different here.

163
00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:19.187
I know it's not Krypton.

164
00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:21.857
But it could be home. if you let it.

165
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.191
No. it can't!

166
00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:25.861
Krypton is my home.

167
00:16:26.278 --> 00:16:29.114
It doesn't matter that it's gone.
It will always be my home.

168
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.117
Kara. I know you're upset.

169
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.202
You can't possibly know how I feel!

170
00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:40.083
Batman's right.
I don't belong here.

171
00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:42.794
With Krypton gone. with mom gone...

172
00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:45.922
I don't belong anywhere.

173
00:16:47.883 --> 00:16:50.051
So. kick me out. I don't care.

174
00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:58.894
Or we could try something different.

175
00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:15.619
Trust me?

176
00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:42.686
Come on!

177
00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:45.398
Wait! Where are we going?

178
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:04.417
Whoa.

179
00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:52.340
Where are we?

180
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.218
Earth. in the 3ist century.

181
00:18:56.511 --> 00:19:00.390
Kara zor El.
welcome to the legion of super-heroes.

182
00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:40.138
Please. take the badge. Just...

183
00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.432
You can get in. Just don't kill me.

184
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.194
No guns.

185
00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:53.711
Why are you here?

186
00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:55.713
Who are you?

187
00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:07.350
The circle remains unbroken.

188
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.366
Batman to any justice league members.
there's been an attack at star labs.

189
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.617
Do you copy?

190
00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:28.830
No. I don't know what they were after.

191
00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.423
Okay. new question.

192
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.468
Uh. how are we in the 3ist century?

193
00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:42.844
Also. why?

194
00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:44.137
Also. what?

195
00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:45.847
We came here with the time bubble.

196
00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:48.933
It's extremely rare technology
that allows travel between

197
00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:52.270
two fixed points in time
and only those points in time.

198
00:21:52.896 --> 00:21:55.356
At least that's how saturn girl
explained it to me.

199
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.734
She's one of the founders
of the legion of super heroes.

200
00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:00.528
Think of them
as the future's justice league.

201
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:04.532
They're a group of heroes who banded
together to fight crime inspired by...

202
00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:07.451
Well. me.

203
00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:10.872
They contacted me through
the time bubble

204
00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:12.248
after we formed the league.

205
00:22:12.874 --> 00:22:15.168
We've been in sporadic
contact ever since.

206
00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:17.587
Which brings us to why we're here.

207
00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:24.802
They run a training program
for potential new legionnaires.

208
00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:29.140
The legion academy.

209
00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:33.102
I thought. if you wanted.
you could train here.

210
00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:34.395
It's not Krypton.

211
00:22:34.854 --> 00:22:37.357
but it's a little closer
than earth of the 2ist century.

212
00:22:42.195 --> 00:22:43.446
I don't know. kal.

213
00:22:44.447 --> 00:22:46.699
If you want to go back.
it's your decision.

214
00:22:47.408 --> 00:22:48.743
I'll support you either way.

215
00:22:49.452 --> 00:22:50.452
Superman.

216
00:22:51.329 --> 00:22:52.329
Kara?

217
00:22:53.498 --> 00:22:55.917
Oh. wow. It is so great to meet you.

218
00:22:58.753 --> 00:23:02.215
I'm mon El. one of the other trainees
at legion academy.

219
00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:03.341
Mon El?

220
00:23:03.675 --> 00:23:05.718
Wait. you're Kryptonian?

221
00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:08.596
Daxamite. actually. from planet daxam.

222
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.391
But I hope you don't mind
me saying this.

223
00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:12.976
I love Krypton.

224
00:23:13.643 --> 00:23:15.061
That's why I changed my name.

225
00:23:15.353 --> 00:23:17.313
I've been a fan ever since I was a kid.

226
00:23:17.855 --> 00:23:22.235
The scientific wonders.
the emphasis on conformity. order.

227
00:23:22.527 --> 00:23:23.611
The robots.

228
00:23:23.945 --> 00:23:24.945
The robots.

229
00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:29.242
Maybe not so much the kryptonite.
but in every other way.

230
00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:31.494
Krypton was incredible.

231
00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:35.123
I know we've just met.
but I really hope you decide

232
00:23:35.206 --> 00:23:37.083
to come train
with us here at the academy.

233
00:23:39.043 --> 00:23:40.211
- Really?
- Yep.

234
00:23:40.503 --> 00:23:42.880
- It seemed like you weren't sure.
- I am now.

235
00:23:42.964 --> 00:23:45.091
We could still go back and train
on the farm together.

236
00:23:45.174 --> 00:23:46.342
Nope. I'm good.

237
00:23:46.426 --> 00:23:47.427
Lift tractors?

238
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.304
Bye. kal. Sorry. you can't stay.

239
00:24:09.532 --> 00:24:10.658
Want the tour?

240
00:24:12.577 --> 00:24:14.037
This is the legion academy.

241
00:24:14.412 --> 00:24:16.581
It's where our training takes place.

242
00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:19.125
The cube is the fight simulation room.

243
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:21.836
It's also connected to the legion's
holographic library...

244
00:24:24.714 --> 00:24:26.716
I'm sure you'll be able to find
your way around.

245
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.885
And that's pretty much the tour.

246
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.887
Except the dorms...

247
00:24:31.304 --> 00:24:33.348
Girls are there. boys are there.

248
00:24:33.806 --> 00:24:37.143
And the window we use to sneak out
after curfew is there.

249
00:24:37.435 --> 00:24:38.436
Noted.

250
00:24:39.896 --> 00:24:40.897
What's that one?

251
00:24:49.697 --> 00:24:50.865
That's the vault.

252
00:24:50.948 --> 00:24:52.551
It's where the legion keeps
all the weapons

253
00:24:52.575 --> 00:24:54.035
they've taken from their enemies.

254
00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:03.294
It's protected by an insane
security system.

255
00:25:03.378 --> 00:25:06.464
and it's never been broken into
in the entire history of the legion.

256
00:25:07.548 --> 00:25:09.175
The system's on a hair trigger.

257
00:25:09.258 --> 00:25:11.552
and it's completely off-limits
to us academy members.

258
00:25:12.053 --> 00:25:14.889
So. in other words.
avoid the death lasers.

259
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.272
- This is dawnstar.
- Your roommate.

260
00:25:24.232 --> 00:25:25.232
Oh!

261
00:25:26.317 --> 00:25:28.820
I am so glad to meet
someone else who can fly.

262
00:25:28.903 --> 00:25:32.073
We can pair up in training
and practice cool power combos.

263
00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:34.701
Ooh. and team up for missions.

264
00:25:36.994 --> 00:25:39.872
Sorry. I'm all. "blah. hi. dawnstar."

265
00:25:40.456 --> 00:25:42.041
It's just nice to meet a new friend.

266
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.127
Well. that's everything.

267
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.671
except meeting the rest
of the academy trainees and...

268
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.510
Brainiac?

269
00:25:53.845 --> 00:25:55.346
He's got a weapon. Get back!

270
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:56.430
Wait!

271
00:25:57.515 --> 00:25:59.350
I don't know
how you survived the bullet.

272
00:25:59.434 --> 00:26:01.936
but I am not going
to let you hurt anyone else.

273
00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:03.688
I don't know what you're talking about.

274
00:26:04.105 --> 00:26:08.234
But given your unhinged actions.
I'm regarding you as a threat.

275
00:26:11.779 --> 00:26:12.947
Unhinged?

276
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.658
You tried to kill Superman. my cousin.

277
00:26:21.122 --> 00:26:23.833
Believe me.
if I had tried to kill Superman.

278
00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:25.668
I would have succeeded.

279
00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:29.464
I am the universe's
only 12th-level intellect.

280
00:26:29.547 --> 00:26:34.177
I invented this force field using
kinetic-reactive photonic energy.

281
00:26:38.806 --> 00:26:43.186
Which means. the more
you punch it. the more solid it gets.

282
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.661
Great. Thanks for the tip.

283
00:27:12.632 --> 00:27:14.467
Okay. That's it.

284
00:27:46.415 --> 00:27:48.376
Fight. fight...

285
00:27:48.459 --> 00:27:50.586
Fight. fight. fight.

286
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.713
fight. fight. fight. fight.

287
00:27:52.797 --> 00:27:55.341
fight. fight. fight. fight.

288
00:28:15.403 --> 00:28:16.487
Stop!

289
00:28:18.656 --> 00:28:20.908
What the ever-loving hell
is going on here?

290
00:28:24.662 --> 00:28:27.957
Reckless endangerment
and damage to a classroom.

291
00:28:28.749 --> 00:28:30.334
What do you have to say for yourselves?

292
00:28:36.048 --> 00:28:37.300
He's brainiac.

293
00:28:37.383 --> 00:28:38.968
Why are we all just sitting here?

294
00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:40.845
As I attempted to tell you.

295
00:28:41.512 --> 00:28:43.180
I am not brainiac.

296
00:28:43.764 --> 00:28:45.308
You pulled a weapon on us.

297
00:28:45.725 --> 00:28:47.325
I was going to make repairs on the laser

298
00:28:47.393 --> 00:28:49.854
for a project
and you jump to conclusions.

299
00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:51.856
Not surprising for a lesser mind.

300
00:28:51.939 --> 00:28:53.566
How is this not a villain?

301
00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:55.651
Kara. he's not brainiac.

302
00:28:55.735 --> 00:28:57.612
This is brainiac 5.

303
00:28:57.904 --> 00:29:00.740
Scientists on planet colu
got their hands on the organic parts

304
00:29:00.823 --> 00:29:02.783
of the original brainiac cyborg

305
00:29:02.867 --> 00:29:05.161
and then used that to make
him and his family.

306
00:29:05.244 --> 00:29:08.664
That is a gross oversimplification
of the cloning process.

307
00:29:08.748 --> 00:29:11.959
- Anyhow...
- Rna mutation alone has allowed me

308
00:29:12.043 --> 00:29:13.419
to surpass my clone siblings.

309
00:29:13.502 --> 00:29:14.754
Anyhow...

310
00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:17.340
He's a bright young man.

311
00:29:17.423 --> 00:29:20.301
and he's enrolled in legion academy.
just like you.

312
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:22.053
By "bright young man."

313
00:29:22.136 --> 00:29:24.680
she means I possess
a 12th-level intelligence

314
00:29:24.764 --> 00:29:27.016
as measured by the scientific
minds of col...

315
00:29:27.642 --> 00:29:30.853
Since we don't have time to sufficiently
describe me.

316
00:29:30.937 --> 00:29:32.605
that will have to do.

317
00:29:32.939 --> 00:29:35.942
I've got
some words to describe you.

318
00:29:36.025 --> 00:29:38.945
Unless those words are "genius."
they're probably incorrect.

319
00:29:39.028 --> 00:29:42.114
Hey. knuckleheads. you're in trouble.

320
00:29:42.198 --> 00:29:44.200
The rest of the legion
are off on a mission.

321
00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:46.035
leaving the three of us in charge.

322
00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:48.829
and you just made our jobs
that much more difficult.

323
00:29:48.913 --> 00:29:50.539
We are truly disappointed.

324
00:29:51.165 --> 00:29:54.293
Since this is your first offense.
we're letting you off with a warning.

325
00:29:54.794 --> 00:29:58.589
But in the future. try to act more like
the heroes you wish to become.

326
00:30:00.257 --> 00:30:01.258
Dismissed.

327
00:30:09.433 --> 00:30:12.311
What is president saturn girl thinking.
letting that kid in?

328
00:30:12.395 --> 00:30:13.771
Superman vouched for Supergirl.

329
00:30:13.854 --> 00:30:16.190
I'm talking about brainiac 5.

330
00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:17.273
Why is he here?

331
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:21.362
Every single brainiac clone
ever has gone evil.

332
00:30:21.445 --> 00:30:23.739
Brainiac 2
was an intergalactic assassin.

333
00:30:23.823 --> 00:30:27.326
Brainiac 3 tried to overthrow
the united planets with mind control.

334
00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.204
Brainiac 4
is just a straight up serial killer.

335
00:30:30.287 --> 00:30:31.664
This is what they do.

336
00:30:31.914 --> 00:30:35.251
The brainiacs show up.
attempt some evil plot. then disappear.

337
00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:38.421
It's only a matter of time
before this kid does the same.

338
00:30:39.296 --> 00:30:41.674
Look. timber wolf. we agree with you.

339
00:30:42.383 --> 00:30:43.384
but we were outvoted.

340
00:30:43.843 --> 00:30:44.843
Were we?

341
00:30:45.344 --> 00:30:48.681
I haven't spoken to a single other
legionnaire who voted to let him in.

342
00:30:49.807 --> 00:30:51.684
I think there's
something fishy going on here.

343
00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.646
We've got bigger problems
than your conspiracy theories right now.

344
00:31:01.444 --> 00:31:04.280
We still have no idea
where the rest of the legion is.

345
00:31:04.697 --> 00:31:07.450
Last check-in. saturn girl
and the others were on their way

346
00:31:07.533 --> 00:31:10.077
to deal with the terrorist attacks
on planet durla.

347
00:31:10.161 --> 00:31:13.330
Then. suddenly. boom. radio silence.

348
00:31:13.414 --> 00:31:15.666
Oh. They're still not answering comms?

349
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.710
They're not even showing up on the map.

350
00:31:17.793 --> 00:31:20.046
It's like they disappeared from the face
of the universe.

351
00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:23.090
We've been having computer troubles
over the past 24 hours.

352
00:31:23.674 --> 00:31:25.259
The issue could be on our end.

353
00:31:25.342 --> 00:31:27.094
We can't discount
anything at this point.

354
00:31:27.511 --> 00:31:30.181
Shadow lass. chemical king.
look into our system.

355
00:31:30.514 --> 00:31:31.807
It could just be bouncing boy

356
00:31:31.891 --> 00:31:33.642
pulling pranks
with the comm arrays again.

357
00:31:34.143 --> 00:31:36.187
But if not. we need to be prepared.

358
00:31:36.562 --> 00:31:39.690
And above all.
don't tell the academy kids.

359
00:31:40.024 --> 00:31:41.776
The less who know. the better.

360
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.322
It has to be tonight.

361
00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.877
That was epic!

362
00:32:00.211 --> 00:32:01.295
Did they kick you out?

363
00:32:01.378 --> 00:32:04.799
Uh. she
wouldn't be here if they did.

364
00:32:05.007 --> 00:32:06.383
Everyone. give her room.

365
00:32:06.926 --> 00:32:09.595
Kara.
this is the rest of the legion academy.

366
00:32:09.678 --> 00:32:11.764
Seriously. that fight was nuts.

367
00:32:11.847 --> 00:32:13.933
I'm bouncing boy. planet earth.

368
00:32:17.728 --> 00:32:18.854
Ta-da!

369
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:23.317
Now. if I said to you.
I've got a bunch of naltorian frogs.

370
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.820
would you be down to help me release
them in the science lab?

371
00:32:25.903 --> 00:32:27.905
-No -come on. It'd be great.

372
00:32:29.782 --> 00:32:30.782
Enchanté.

373
00:32:31.242 --> 00:32:33.244
Invisible kid. also from planet earth.

374
00:32:34.411 --> 00:32:35.663
Whoa!

375
00:32:35.746 --> 00:32:37.832
Can you turn other things
invisible too?

376
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.040
Yes.

377
00:32:39.166 --> 00:32:43.045
Well. actually. no.
but I'm really close to figuring it out.

378
00:32:44.797 --> 00:32:46.799
Okay. I love the hair.

379
00:32:47.216 --> 00:32:48.968
Oh. yeah. hate the cape.

380
00:32:49.468 --> 00:32:50.636
We can work with the boots.

381
00:32:50.719 --> 00:32:52.847
Triplicate girl. Planet cargg.

382
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:55.975
Okay. so. this is phantom girl.

383
00:32:59.145 --> 00:33:00.145
She's shy.

384
00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:05.943
Proty. our class pet.

385
00:33:09.071 --> 00:33:10.071
Hello.

386
00:33:10.281 --> 00:33:12.366
And arms fall off boy.

387
00:33:18.706 --> 00:33:21.625
And sometimes they even stay on.

388
00:33:21.709 --> 00:33:22.709
Wow.

389
00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:26.172
That's... really cool.

390
00:33:26.839 --> 00:33:28.340
No. We suck.

391
00:33:28.591 --> 00:33:30.301
Hey. that's not true.

392
00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:33.637
I'll have you know my psychic
pathfinding powers are unique.

393
00:33:33.971 --> 00:33:35.514
Yes. so are mine.

394
00:33:35.598 --> 00:33:37.016
That doesn't mean they're good.

395
00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:38.976
There's only one open legion spot.

396
00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:41.103
And everyone knows
mon e! Is gonna get it.

397
00:33:42.021 --> 00:33:43.781
We're never going to make
it into the legion.

398
00:33:44.023 --> 00:33:47.067
Faceit
we're waiting-list material at best.

399
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.571
Not even the legion of substitute heroes
would have us.

400
00:33:50.654 --> 00:33:53.282
Hey. you don't know
what's going to happen.

401
00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.701
I think everyone
has the potential to be heroes.

402
00:33:56.327 --> 00:33:58.078
even people like brainiac 5.

403
00:33:58.662 --> 00:34:01.582
But maybe. for the safety
of the rest of the buildings.

404
00:34:02.625 --> 00:34:03.834
you should just avoid him.

405
00:34:06.337 --> 00:34:08.497
The legion
does more than simply fight.

406
00:34:08.797 --> 00:34:10.817
- We are the once called in...
- Or maybe you can't.

407
00:34:10.841 --> 00:34:13.052
When there are disasters.
diplomatic incidents

408
00:34:13.135 --> 00:34:14.678
or when people are in need of rescue.

409
00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:16.972
To be considered for the legion.

410
00:34:17.056 --> 00:34:18.682
you need to train your mind.

411
00:34:19.266 --> 00:34:21.769
So. who can solve
this hyperdrive equation?

412
00:34:23.687 --> 00:34:24.687
Supergirl?

413
00:34:26.106 --> 00:34:27.191
Supergirl!

414
00:34:43.832 --> 00:34:45.709
That is clearly incorrect.

415
00:34:49.546 --> 00:34:52.883
The legion does
more than simply solve problems.

416
00:34:53.467 --> 00:34:56.470
We are the front lines.
stopping terrorists.

417
00:34:56.553 --> 00:34:59.056
administering justice.
and preventing war.

418
00:34:59.807 --> 00:35:01.475
To be considered for the legion.

419
00:35:01.976 --> 00:35:03.269
you need to train your body.

420
00:35:03.644 --> 00:35:05.729
Training room. fight simulation beta.

421
00:35:06.272 --> 00:35:07.189
Acknowledged.

422
00:35:07.273 --> 00:35:09.733
Flight simulation beta
will commence now.

423
00:35:14.113 --> 00:35:15.113
Got it!

424
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.289
Oh. no.

425
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:25.457
Too slow.

426
00:35:30.963 --> 00:35:32.047
No.

427
00:35:32.131 --> 00:35:35.968
You need a stabilizer
so the a! System doesn't malfunction.

428
00:35:36.051 --> 00:35:38.804
No. you don't. because it's already
in the programming.

429
00:35:38.887 --> 00:35:41.807
I am literally
the descendant of a cyborg.

430
00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:44.310
Logically. you should
be listening to me.

431
00:35:47.563 --> 00:35:50.482
I'm from Krypton. We invented robotics.

432
00:35:50.566 --> 00:35:53.569
And I'm from colu. we perfected them.

433
00:35:53.902 --> 00:35:54.902
I'm right!

434
00:36:15.257 --> 00:36:18.052
You are objectively in the wrong.

435
00:36:44.078 --> 00:36:46.622
Okay. Maybe it did need a stabilizer.

436
00:36:50.626 --> 00:36:51.919
We need to shut it down.

437
00:36:52.211 --> 00:36:54.755
- If you damage the psionic processor...
- Way ahead of you.

438
00:36:57.257 --> 00:36:59.676
Just give me some space to move.

439
00:37:10.479 --> 00:37:13.273
There.
Engage the motion targeting system.

440
00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:19.863
Understood.
Everyone stay perfectly still.

441
00:37:34.545 --> 00:37:35.545
Got it.

442
00:37:35.587 --> 00:37:36.964
Impressive thinking.

443
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.260
In truth.
I almost forgot this was all your fault.

444
00:37:41.343 --> 00:37:42.344
My fault?

445
00:37:42.761 --> 00:37:46.473
Listen. you green skinned. overgrown.
poor excuse for a cyborg.

446
00:37:46.557 --> 00:37:48.326
- Where do you get off telling me...
- Nope. I'm done.

447
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.060
You're done. Training over.

448
00:37:50.144 --> 00:37:52.187
- You two are out.
- But_

449
00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:54.940
Disappointment doesn't even
begin to cover your actions.

450
00:37:55.023 --> 00:37:56.817
We will deal with you in the morning.

451
00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.193
Until then...

452
00:38:07.286 --> 00:38:09.079
Hey. don't beat yourself up.

453
00:38:09.496 --> 00:38:12.749
Honestly. you are not the first person
to get into a fight with brainiac 5.

454
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.626
- Really?
- Are you serious?

455
00:38:15.085 --> 00:38:17.463
Mr. "I'm more logical than thou?"

456
00:38:17.838 --> 00:38:19.882
He's a jerk who thinks
he's better than everyone.

457
00:38:20.424 --> 00:38:21.884
No one wants him around.

458
00:38:22.342 --> 00:38:24.761
Not even timber wolf
and the other legionnaires.

459
00:38:24.845 --> 00:38:26.430
I mean. hejust doesn't belong here.

460
00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:52.079
What?

461
00:38:52.623 --> 00:38:54.958
Supergirl. You coming?

462
00:39:04.259 --> 00:39:06.887
Like I said. we've got to go before all
the good seats are taken.

463
00:39:12.351 --> 00:39:13.351
Proty.

464
00:39:13.685 --> 00:39:15.062
Where are you?

465
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:20.067
Please come back before I
have to tell dawnstar I lost you again.

466
00:39:20.317 --> 00:39:24.821
Here. proty. proty. proty.
You good little. uh. thing.

467
00:39:28.659 --> 00:39:29.743
Ugh.

468
00:39:30.035 --> 00:39:32.120
You know what? I'm cold and tired.

469
00:39:32.204 --> 00:39:33.556
Let's give ourselves one more minute.

470
00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.832
then figure out a way
to blame bouncing boy for this.

471
00:39:37.584 --> 00:39:39.336
There you are.

472
00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:51.681
What the heck?

473
00:40:17.666 --> 00:40:21.086
Hey. brainiac 5. Look. I'm...

474
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:25.132
I was kind of a jerk to you.
I mean. you were a biggerjerk to me.

475
00:40:27.884 --> 00:40:30.762
Brainiac 5.
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

476
00:40:31.096 --> 00:40:34.349
but I think we're more
alike than you know and...

477
00:40:34.641 --> 00:40:36.643
Why is this so hard?

478
00:40:39.521 --> 00:40:41.523
Brainiac 5. I'm sorry.

479
00:40:42.232 --> 00:40:43.317
Can we start over?

480
00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.080
What are you doing?

481
00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:02.127
Go away. This doesn't concern you.

482
00:41:03.253 --> 00:41:04.253
Uh-huh.

483
00:41:05.047 --> 00:41:06.647
Because it looks
like you're trying to...

484
00:41:06.673 --> 00:41:08.425
I don't...

485
00:41:08.508 --> 00:41:09.508
Proty?

486
00:41:09.718 --> 00:41:10.802
What are you doing out?

487
00:41:17.893 --> 00:41:18.893
Is she...

488
00:41:20.187 --> 00:41:21.187
She... she can't be.

489
00:41:22.439 --> 00:41:23.607
I'm too late.

490
00:41:39.039 --> 00:41:40.666
You won't be needing this.

491
00:41:41.041 --> 00:41:42.417
Stay back. Supergirl.

492
00:41:42.626 --> 00:41:45.170
Brainiac 5 is not who he pretends to be.

493
00:41:45.837 --> 00:41:48.215
He planted a virus
in our computer system.

494
00:41:48.298 --> 00:41:51.051
It's why we haven't been able to reach
the rest of the legion.

495
00:41:51.134 --> 00:41:53.679
And no one voted
to let him join the academy.

496
00:41:54.054 --> 00:41:55.639
He hacked in and changed the tally.

497
00:41:55.722 --> 00:41:56.723
All for this.

498
00:41:57.349 --> 00:42:00.852
To break into the vault and steal
the weapons inside for some sick plot.

499
00:42:01.645 --> 00:42:03.730
We moved as fast as we could
once we knew. but...

500
00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:07.526
Poor triplicate girl paid the price
for our stupidity

501
00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:08.985
in trusting a brainiac.

502
00:42:10.737 --> 00:42:14.533
Yes. I hacked your computers.
but I did not kill triplicate girl.

503
00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:16.618
This is the work of the dark circle.

504
00:42:16.743 --> 00:42:18.680
They've been planning
to infiltrate the legion...

505
00:42:18.704 --> 00:42:20.455
You expect us to believe that?

506
00:42:20.789 --> 00:42:22.708
You have to! I would never hurt...

507
00:42:24.835 --> 00:42:26.795
You're just another clone gone bad.

508
00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.805
We'll be at the holding cells.
Put hq on lockdown.

509
00:42:37.264 --> 00:42:39.725
We'll break the news in the morning.

510
00:42:41.852 --> 00:42:44.229
Wait. This doesn't make any sense.

511
00:42:44.312 --> 00:42:48.900
Why would brainiac 5 go to the vault.
kill triplicate girl and then walk away.

512
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:51.528
only to come back
just in time to get caught?

513
00:42:52.654 --> 00:42:54.531
She clearly surprised
him the first time.

514
00:42:54.906 --> 00:42:57.451
He stupidly panicked.
then came back to finish the job.

515
00:42:58.869 --> 00:43:02.998
Exactly. That's stupid.
and brainiac 5 isn't stupid.

516
00:43:03.498 --> 00:43:04.791
What if he wasn't lying?

517
00:43:05.125 --> 00:43:08.211
I feel like I've heard the name
dark circle before. It's...

518
00:43:09.045 --> 00:43:10.422
Familiar somehow.

519
00:43:11.423 --> 00:43:13.008
Brainiac 5 is evil.

520
00:43:13.842 --> 00:43:14.842
You were right.

521
00:43:15.469 --> 00:43:16.469
Go back to the dorms.

522
00:43:17.429 --> 00:43:18.429
It's over now.

523
00:43:47.542 --> 00:43:50.086
Training room. access library databanks.

524
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.839
Bring up any information
you have on the dark circle.

525
00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.990
Accessing files on the dark circle.

526
00:43:56.551 --> 00:43:58.553
Searching. Searching.

527
00:43:59.304 --> 00:44:00.304
Found.

528
00:44:03.308 --> 00:44:05.668
The dark circle. A terrorist cult.

529
00:44:05.727 --> 00:44:08.814
The dark circle has gone by many names
over the centuries.

530
00:44:09.231 --> 00:44:14.444
The black zero. The ouroboros.
The beginning. The end.

531
00:44:14.694 --> 00:44:17.447
But they are always identified
by the same symbol.

532
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.740
Who are they?

533
00:44:19.783 --> 00:44:22.452
Fanatics. pursuing an unknown goal.

534
00:44:22.786 --> 00:44:23.662
Over the centuries.

535
00:44:23.745 --> 00:44:26.915
they emerge to wreak havoc.
blowing up buildings.

536
00:44:26.998 --> 00:44:30.043
providing weapons of advanced origin
to other terrorist groups.

537
00:44:30.585 --> 00:44:33.588
There are even reports of them
appearing as observers.

538
00:44:34.714 --> 00:44:35.714
Watching.

539
00:44:35.966 --> 00:44:36.966
Waiting.

540
00:44:38.218 --> 00:44:40.804
Then they vanish. No trace to be found.

541
00:44:41.596 --> 00:44:44.766
Leader. unknown. Origins. unknown.

542
00:44:45.058 --> 00:44:46.142
End of file.

543
00:44:46.685 --> 00:44:47.769
Powering down.

544
00:45:09.082 --> 00:45:10.750
Huh?

545
00:45:18.884 --> 00:45:23.847
I've seen them. the dark circle.
in the past and also here. now.

546
00:45:24.264 --> 00:45:26.766
You said I'm too late.
Too late for what?

547
00:45:27.183 --> 00:45:28.183
What's going on?

548
00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.150
I'm not going anywhere. so talk.

549
00:45:38.653 --> 00:45:40.614
You're relentless. You know that. right?

550
00:45:44.034 --> 00:45:46.328
Created by the god-like
controllers of oa.

551
00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:50.290
the miracle machine allows
a user to bend reality to their will.

552
00:45:50.874 --> 00:45:53.668
Its original purpose disappeared
with the controllers.

553
00:45:54.085 --> 00:45:55.085
Since then.

554
00:45:55.462 --> 00:45:58.506
it has been used as a weapon
of mass destruction.

555
00:45:59.633 --> 00:46:01.718
The legion managed
to get their hands on it.

556
00:46:02.802 --> 00:46:04.137
and placed it in the vault.

557
00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:07.098
I overheard my family making plans
to break into the vault

558
00:46:07.182 --> 00:46:09.059
and steal the machine
for the circle's leader.

559
00:46:09.768 --> 00:46:11.102
I couldn't let that happen.

560
00:46:11.937 --> 00:46:15.690
So. logically.
there was only one thing to do.

561
00:46:16.775 --> 00:46:19.819
Enroll myself in the academy
and take the machine before they did.

562
00:46:19.903 --> 00:46:23.198
Wouldn't the logical thing have been
to just tell the legion?

563
00:46:23.281 --> 00:46:25.325
Ah. yes. let's try that.

564
00:46:25.742 --> 00:46:29.162
"Hi. I'm the grandson of one of earth's
greatest villains.

565
00:46:29.245 --> 00:46:30.330
My family is psychotic.

566
00:46:30.413 --> 00:46:32.958
and I need you to let me take a weapon
of mass destruction."

567
00:46:35.502 --> 00:46:36.586
Why would they believe me?

568
00:46:38.338 --> 00:46:39.338
No one ever does.

569
00:46:40.632 --> 00:46:42.634
I'm sure you assume I'm lying too. so...

570
00:46:43.635 --> 00:46:44.678
You know. just go.

571
00:46:57.399 --> 00:47:00.610
Come on. If the dark circle is here.
we don't have very much time.

572
00:47:00.694 --> 00:47:01.528
What are you doing?

573
00:47:01.611 --> 00:47:04.114
I'm helping you break into the vault
and get the machine.

574
00:47:04.197 --> 00:47:06.116
If they had it.
they'd have used it by now.

575
00:47:06.199 --> 00:47:07.450
I think we can still beat them.

576
00:47:10.912 --> 00:47:12.789
No. I mean. why?

577
00:47:13.915 --> 00:47:15.417
Because I believe you.

578
00:47:19.421 --> 00:47:21.297
Timber wolf
and the others will be patrolling.

579
00:47:21.715 --> 00:47:23.842
How are we going to get past them
without my belt?

580
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.695
And this is humiliating.

581
00:47:43.778 --> 00:47:44.778
This is fun!

582
00:47:44.988 --> 00:47:46.215
I had a nightmare like this once.

583
00:47:46.239 --> 00:47:49.325
If you don't stop complaining.
I'll start flying upside down.

584
00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.173
All right. the coast is clear.

585
00:48:03.423 --> 00:48:04.549
Wait...

586
00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:06.676
Supergirl. I...

587
00:48:07.719 --> 00:48:09.721
Logically. you have no reason
to help me.

588
00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:11.221
but you are.

589
00:48:11.931 --> 00:48:14.684
So. for my previous actions.

590
00:48:15.435 --> 00:48:16.686
- I'm sorry...
- Shh.

591
00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:18.146
Are you trying to get caught?

592
00:48:19.064 --> 00:48:20.064
Keep it down.

593
00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:21.232
Mon El?

594
00:48:21.316 --> 00:48:22.984
I heard timber wolf
and the others talking

595
00:48:23.068 --> 00:48:24.694
as I was heading back to the dorms.

596
00:48:24.944 --> 00:48:27.405
I know everything and I want to help.

597
00:48:28.656 --> 00:48:29.741
I trust Supergirl.

598
00:48:30.408 --> 00:48:32.243
If she thinks you're innocent.
then I do too.

599
00:48:32.327 --> 00:48:34.996
That's great!
We could definitely use help.

600
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.080
Right. brainy?

601
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:38.792
Yeah. Great.

602
00:48:39.167 --> 00:48:40.167
Of course!

603
00:48:40.543 --> 00:48:42.212
So. what are we doing?

604
00:48:43.755 --> 00:48:47.133
Breaking the universe's most unbreakable
security system.

605
00:49:26.214 --> 00:49:28.842
- What is this?
- This is the security code.

606
00:49:29.342 --> 00:49:30.844
The vault has a two-step process.

607
00:49:31.261 --> 00:49:33.179
First. the laser grid. then this.

608
00:49:33.847 --> 00:49:37.142
Break the code and a door will open
into the exact chamber we want.

609
00:49:37.684 --> 00:49:39.352
But we only have a short
window of time.

610
00:49:39.435 --> 00:49:40.435
How short?

611
00:49:47.527 --> 00:49:50.864
If I don't break this in the next
30 seconds. they kill us.

612
00:49:50.947 --> 00:49:51.990
Can you do it?

613
00:49:52.407 --> 00:49:53.741
I'm brainiac 5.

614
00:49:54.159 --> 00:49:56.953
The universe's
only 12th-level intelligence.

615
00:49:57.203 --> 00:49:59.330
I can do anything.

616
00:50:17.182 --> 00:50:18.182
Incredible.

617
00:50:18.892 --> 00:50:22.687
The code is a holographic neural overlay
designed to cook the user's brain.

618
00:50:23.479 --> 00:50:26.816
unless they can decrypt while keeping
a mental lock on their objective.

619
00:50:27.525 --> 00:50:31.112
This is...
Going to take longer than I thought.

620
00:50:31.196 --> 00:50:32.196
How much longer?

621
00:50:34.949 --> 00:50:35.992
More than 30 seconds.

622
00:50:36.075 --> 00:50:38.369
Keep working on the code.
I'll take out the robots.

623
00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:41.789
Whatever you do. don't destroy them.

624
00:50:42.373 --> 00:50:43.625
The instant one breaks.

625
00:50:43.708 --> 00:50:45.418
it'll trigger a purge
of the entire room.

626
00:50:45.501 --> 00:50:48.296
Brainy. I'm not great
at gently fighting things.

627
00:50:50.048 --> 00:50:51.674
Just try!

628
00:51:11.402 --> 00:51:13.655
Not to rush you. but hurry it up.

629
00:51:13.738 --> 00:51:14.781
I'm trying.

630
00:51:15.657 --> 00:51:18.701
The code keeps resetting.

631
00:51:37.845 --> 00:51:38.845
Got it!

632
00:52:08.042 --> 00:52:09.042
That's it.

633
00:52:09.168 --> 00:52:10.670
Whoo!

634
00:52:10.753 --> 00:52:11.753
We did it!

635
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.300
We did it.

636
00:52:18.845 --> 00:52:19.971
We certainly did.

637
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:23.683
Brainiac 5 broke the code...

638
00:52:28.187 --> 00:52:30.440
And the circle remains unbroken.

639
00:52:43.244 --> 00:52:44.370
Kara!

640
00:52:45.663 --> 00:52:48.374
What are you doing?

641
00:52:48.458 --> 00:52:50.835
For the universe's
only 12th-level intellect.

642
00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:52.920
you sure are dumb. aren't you?

643
00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:57.759
I'm in the dark circle.

644
00:54:16.129 --> 00:54:18.423
I'd stop moving so much if I were you.

645
00:54:18.881 --> 00:54:21.801
It spreads the kryptonite
from the dagger faster.

646
00:54:22.009 --> 00:54:23.845
Why?

647
00:54:23.928 --> 00:54:26.389
Of all people.
you should understand.

648
00:54:27.223 --> 00:54:30.726
Your culture was the greatest
the universe had ever seen.

649
00:54:31.269 --> 00:54:34.355
Orderly. Uniform. Pure.

650
00:54:35.356 --> 00:54:36.941
But this world we live in.

651
00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:39.402
this world is rotten.

652
00:54:39.694 --> 00:54:42.321
The legion is the heart of the rot.

653
00:54:42.405 --> 00:54:46.451
encouraging losers like triplicate girl
and bouncing boy.

654
00:54:47.118 --> 00:54:50.621
They delude misfits into thinking
they can be heroes.

655
00:54:50.705 --> 00:54:52.415
when they're just freaks.

656
00:54:54.792 --> 00:54:57.670
Now. the dark circle
will take over.

657
00:54:58.045 --> 00:54:59.982
We. who are superior.

658
00:55:00.006 --> 00:55:01.446
will lead the way...

659
00:55:02.717 --> 00:55:07.054
Elevating the world to heights
not seen since the Kryptonian empire.

660
00:55:10.266 --> 00:55:11.726
The legion has fallen.

661
00:55:12.477 --> 00:55:15.021
The time of freaks has ended.

662
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.483
As for you two.
our leader would like a word.

663
00:55:32.288 --> 00:55:33.288
Hold on. Kara.

664
00:55:33.873 --> 00:55:34.916
Just hold on.

665
00:55:35.208 --> 00:55:39.337
Be silent in the presence
of the beginning and the end.

666
00:55:44.884 --> 00:55:47.303
Hello. grandson.

667
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:50.430
Brainiac.

668
00:55:51.474 --> 00:55:52.892
No. impossible.

669
00:55:53.559 --> 00:55:54.559
You're dead.

670
00:55:55.144 --> 00:55:57.480
You died in the 2ist century!

671
00:55:58.731 --> 00:56:02.068
The kryptonite bullet
went through my brain. yes.

672
00:56:02.985 --> 00:56:06.656
but there was enough left
to rebuild around the damage.

673
00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:11.953
And a genius like myself never
goes without a backup plan.

674
00:56:12.453 --> 00:56:16.457
I created the dark circle
a 1.000 years past

675
00:56:16.541 --> 00:56:20.002
to carry out my vision for a new world.

676
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:24.674
It was the circle who stole my brain
out of my old body.

677
00:56:25.091 --> 00:56:30.805
It was they who regrew it.
tending to me over the centuries.

678
00:56:31.097 --> 00:56:36.018
But all would be for naught
if it weren't for you.

679
00:56:38.145 --> 00:56:39.146
What do you mean?

680
00:56:39.939 --> 00:56:43.234
Did you think you just
happened to overhear

681
00:56:43.317 --> 00:56:46.320
our plans to take the miracle machine?

682
00:56:47.989 --> 00:56:51.909
The other clones
were mere 10th-level intelligences.

683
00:56:51.993 --> 00:56:57.164
There was only one being in the universe
who could break the security code.

684
00:56:57.915 --> 00:56:58.916
You.

685
00:56:59.792 --> 00:57:03.671
We used you to get the machine.

686
00:57:04.088 --> 00:57:05.088
Were...

687
00:57:05.423 --> 00:57:08.217
You said my clone siblings
were 10th-level.

688
00:57:09.051 --> 00:57:10.094
Where are they?

689
00:57:11.846 --> 00:57:13.055
Hmm.

690
00:57:13.556 --> 00:57:15.057
Right here.

691
00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:20.855
By the time my brain finished regrowing.
my old body was useless.

692
00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.232
The circle cloned me.

693
00:57:23.316 --> 00:57:27.653
and I picked the best parts
from each to build a new one.

694
00:57:27.737 --> 00:57:31.657
They weren't pleased
when they found out.

695
00:57:32.325 --> 00:57:33.909
You lied to us.

696
00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:35.578
Stay away!

697
00:57:35.911 --> 00:57:37.121
Stay away from me!

698
00:57:37.246 --> 00:57:39.457
No! No! God. no!

699
00:57:40.249 --> 00:57:44.545
But. logically.
what other purpose could you serve?

700
00:57:44.629 --> 00:57:46.756
The fools thought
they were being groomed

701
00:57:46.839 --> 00:57:49.759
as the next leader of the dark circle.

702
00:57:49.842 --> 00:57:53.346
For hubris alone. they deserve death.

703
00:57:53.763 --> 00:57:58.559
I am the most advanced
mind that has ever existed.

704
00:57:58.893 --> 00:58:02.188
Thus. logically. I must be the one

705
00:58:02.271 --> 00:58:06.067
to purge the universe of chaos and rot.

706
00:58:06.442 --> 00:58:10.404
For those who are superior
will lead the way

707
00:58:10.488 --> 00:58:13.532
to a pure and orderly future.

708
00:58:14.617 --> 00:58:18.120
The only one strong enough
to stop me was Supergirl.

709
00:58:18.537 --> 00:58:23.125
So. we watched her
and found her weakness.

710
00:58:23.209 --> 00:58:26.003
Kryptonite.

711
00:58:26.587 --> 00:58:31.092
And your drive to help
those more pathetic than yourself.

712
00:58:32.343 --> 00:58:33.886
You're a monster.

713
00:58:36.472 --> 00:58:38.224
I am a hero.

714
00:58:38.599 --> 00:58:42.853
There are threats on the horizon
only I can counter.

715
00:58:43.145 --> 00:58:46.232
When I bend reality to my will.

716
00:58:46.315 --> 00:58:51.112
all will laud me as their savior.

717
00:58:53.114 --> 00:58:58.077
Once Supergirl is dead.
I will incorporate you into my body.

718
00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:01.080
The son will become the father.

719
00:59:01.622 --> 00:59:05.459
and the circle will remain unbroken.

720
00:59:16.971 --> 00:59:18.055
Find them.

721
00:59:18.597 --> 00:59:21.976
I will begin to attune
myself to the machine.

722
00:59:32.319 --> 00:59:33.529
Hurts.

723
00:59:33.612 --> 00:59:34.612
It's going to be okay.

724
00:59:35.614 --> 00:59:38.492
I just need to get the kryptonite
out of your wound. all right?

725
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:46.792
No! I'm working on something.
but you've got to stay awake.

726
00:59:48.419 --> 00:59:49.420
Kara.

727
00:59:50.421 --> 00:59:51.421
Kara?

728
00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:53.840
Trying to.

729
00:59:54.258 --> 00:59:56.427
Keep talking.

730
01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:05.728
Talking to people is not my strong suit.

731
01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:08.981
Could I list
chemical compositions instead?

732
01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:14.320
No. no. no. Kara!

733
01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:15.403
Stay with me.

734
01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:29.794
I'm sorry.

735
01:00:31.003 --> 01:00:32.505
I was wrong about everything.

736
01:00:32.755 --> 01:00:35.341
I'm supposed to be smart and logical.

737
01:00:35.424 --> 01:00:37.927
but my plan to stop the dark circle
wasn't logical.

738
01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:40.387
It was me trying
to prove to everyone that I...

739
01:00:40.471 --> 01:00:41.806
I'm not my family.

740
01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:45.100
I'm not just another evil clone.

741
01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:49.480
But I'm not. I messed it up.

742
01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:51.607
I'm not like you.

743
01:00:52.024 --> 01:00:53.150
You're so confident.

744
01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:54.777
and brilliant.

745
01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:56.862
and strong. and...

746
01:00:57.905 --> 01:00:58.905
And?

747
01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:05.621
And beautiful.

748
01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.080
And?

749
01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:09.458
And I can't think straight
when you smile at me.

750
01:01:38.571 --> 01:01:40.614
- Well. there you two are.
- Finally.

751
01:01:40.781 --> 01:01:41.949
Good work. pg.

752
01:01:42.283 --> 01:01:44.243
- Triplicate girl?
- You're alive.

753
01:01:44.869 --> 01:01:46.620
Yeah. no thanks to mon El!

754
01:01:46.704 --> 01:01:48.264
You know that son of a bitch killed me?

755
01:01:48.497 --> 01:01:50.916
You know. I saw him meeting up
with those people in masks.

756
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.711
I peeled off an extra me
right before I got to the vault

757
01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:55.546
and he killed my third self.

758
01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.381
So. I need you nerds
to come up with a plan

759
01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:59.300
to save the day
so I can kill him right back.

760
01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:02.219
Did I mention. I'm going to kill him?

761
01:02:02.303 --> 01:02:04.072
Yeah. only about.
like. a million times.

762
01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:05.096
Invisible kid?

763
01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:06.632
In the flesh.

764
01:02:06.682 --> 01:02:09.059
Phantom girl found triplicate girl
right before the attack.

765
01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:10.895
I managed to turn invisible and escape.

766
01:02:10.978 --> 01:02:13.147
And the three of us
have been hiding ever since.

767
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:16.025
And your clothes are...

768
01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:19.069
On! The clothes are on!

769
01:02:19.153 --> 01:02:21.155
I turned all of me invisible this time.

770
01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.198
See. I told you.
I told you I almost had it.

771
01:02:23.282 --> 01:02:25.034
So. the teachers are knocked out.

772
01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:26.761
the rest of the academy
members are trapped.

773
01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:29.580
and I am just itching
to give mon e! A little...

774
01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:30.748
Payback.

775
01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.167
What happened to.
"we're waiting-list material?"

776
01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:36.211
No. Screw that. I'm pissed.

777
01:02:36.295 --> 01:02:38.923
Now. we're kicking-ass material.

778
01:02:39.131 --> 01:02:40.491
The legion is gone.

779
01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:42.050
It's up to us.

780
01:02:42.635 --> 01:02:44.094
So. let's go be heroes.

781
01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:49.850
You've got an idea. don't you?

782
01:02:53.062 --> 01:02:56.523
I have the beginnings of a plan.
yes. but_

783
01:02:56.607 --> 01:02:59.234
We'll need all the academy
members to pull it off.

784
01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:00.921
Yeah. Uh. excuse me.

785
01:03:00.945 --> 01:03:02.279
Is the plan to flirt forever?

786
01:03:02.363 --> 01:03:04.424
Because we're kind
of in a time crunch here. lovebirds.

787
01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:06.700
Oh. that's not I... I mean...

788
01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:09.453
It's okay.

789
01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:10.996
What do you need us to do?

790
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:52.079
I can't find a trace
of the legion anywhere.

791
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:53.621
Then let me.

792
01:04:10.806 --> 01:04:11.974
Still nothing...

793
01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:24.570
Quadrant beta. orbiting the black star
by planet winath.

794
01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:29.283
Encrypting message.
compensating for cosmic interference

795
01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:32.661
from the black hole. and the sos is...

796
01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:34.537
Sent.

797
01:04:42.755 --> 01:04:44.089
- Yes!
- Yeah! All right!

798
01:04:48.844 --> 01:04:50.220
Now. the hard part.

799
01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:53.806
Keep searching.

800
01:04:54.058 --> 01:04:56.643
Brainiac has almost finished
syncing to the machine.

801
01:04:57.061 --> 01:04:58.687
We can't let them ruin this now.

802
01:04:58.771 --> 01:04:59.855
You mean us?

803
01:05:03.442 --> 01:05:04.442
Get them!

804
01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:49.905
Nice try.

805
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.012
Move away from the machine. brainiac.

806
01:06:14.555 --> 01:06:15.597
It's over.

807
01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:17.224
No.

808
01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:20.185
It is just beginning.

809
01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.232
I see it.

810
01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:27.860
The shape of all things.

811
01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:29.903
An endless circle.

812
01:06:29.987 --> 01:06:33.782
which I break and form anew.

813
01:06:40.372 --> 01:06:45.169
Those deluded enough
to think themselves my equal will fall.

814
01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:01.643
As will those
strong enough to ever pose a threat.

815
01:07:05.272 --> 01:07:10.569
And any world that could ever disrupt
the dominance of brainiac!

816
01:07:29.296 --> 01:07:35.177
I thought I was brilliant before.
but I was nothing.

817
01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:40.557
Now. I am the supreme being!

818
01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:42.601
Hardly.

819
01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:46.271
You just happen to be the one

820
01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:48.732
holding the machine.

821
01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:52.110
I always thought
us clones surpassed you.

822
01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:55.614
You were copies of greatness.

823
01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:58.533
I am the mastermind of reality.

824
01:07:58.617 --> 01:08:01.620
I am the leader of the dark circle.

825
01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:02.621
I am...

826
01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:05.332
The greatest mind
the universe has ever known!

827
01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:08.043
I am greater than what came before me.

828
01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:11.922
I am a 10th-level intellect
and you are nothing.

829
01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:15.217
No! You serve me.

830
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.262
Your wills are no match for mine!

831
01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:19.972
You are obsolete.

832
01:08:20.347 --> 01:08:23.308
As long as the miracle machine
is in this reality.

833
01:08:23.392 --> 01:08:25.936
it will obey the will
of its last user.

834
01:08:26.561 --> 01:08:28.981
And that will be me. not you.

835
01:08:29.064 --> 01:08:31.441
No. it will be me.

836
01:08:31.692 --> 01:08:34.278
I am the heir to the dark circle!

837
01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:37.406
I alone will rule this new reality.

838
01:08:37.489 --> 01:08:39.574
No. iwill.

839
01:08:58.343 --> 01:08:59.344
Stop!

840
01:09:02.097 --> 01:09:04.599
You will destroy us. you idiots!

841
01:09:06.268 --> 01:09:08.312
There can only be...

842
01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:10.772
Oneleader

843
01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:15.569
who's it going to be?

844
01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:56.068
It's not stopping.

845
01:09:56.485 --> 01:09:58.070
Brainiac 4 was right.

846
01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:01.073
The machine won't stop
until reality unravels.

847
01:10:16.505 --> 01:10:19.049
How is this the only thing
I'm not able to break?

848
01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:47.701
Mom?

849
01:10:54.334 --> 01:10:56.044
I... I could bring her back.

850
01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:01.299
I could bring Krypton back.

851
01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:11.309
But it won't stop reality from breaking.

852
01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:29.493
Imiss you...

853
01:11:31.079 --> 01:11:32.747
Every single day.

854
01:11:34.583 --> 01:11:36.168
I wish things were different.

855
01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:39.212
But Krypton is gone.

856
01:11:40.172 --> 01:11:41.423
And I'm needed here.

857
01:11:46.094 --> 01:11:47.471
I have to let you go now...

858
01:11:49.264 --> 01:11:50.557
And save the world.

859
01:11:51.475 --> 01:11:53.477
I just hope I've made you proud.

860
01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:02.194
Always. my Kara. always.

861
01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:22.589
The miracle machine
will continue to destroy everything

862
01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.925
as long as it's in this reality.

863
01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:27.928
- So...
- Let's will it into a different one.

864
01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:06.234
Thank you.

865
01:14:06.735 --> 01:14:07.735
For what?

866
01:14:33.887 --> 01:14:35.430
I got ya. triplicate girl!

867
01:14:35.722 --> 01:14:36.722
Thanks. bouncy.

868
01:14:39.476 --> 01:14:41.019
It's duplicate girl now.

869
01:14:45.357 --> 01:14:46.650
I like the new name.

870
01:14:50.028 --> 01:14:53.490
What about "duo damsel?"
Ya know. alliteration's kinda cool.

871
01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:00.162
Never mind.

872
01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:12.300
Wait. We're picking new names?

873
01:15:12.384 --> 01:15:15.720
Then from now on.
I am arms fall off man!

874
01:15:20.308 --> 01:15:23.019
Oh. All right. I love it!

875
01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:27.695
I thought you said
they were useless!

876
01:15:27.774 --> 01:15:29.109
They... they were.

877
01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:32.445
Retreat! Everyone. fall back!

878
01:15:37.367 --> 01:15:39.828
Oh. no. you don't. Pg. here!

879
01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:51.588
Hey. guys.

880
01:15:51.965 --> 01:15:53.425
Save any for us?

881
01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:33.298
There's still time to change your mind.

882
01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:35.216
There will always be a place

883
01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:38.344
in the dark circle
for those with true power.

884
01:16:39.137 --> 01:16:41.014
You and I could lead it.

885
01:16:41.306 --> 01:16:43.349
And bring back the pride of Krypton.

886
01:16:45.477 --> 01:16:48.521
Oh. mon El. you'rejust wrong.

887
01:17:14.464 --> 01:17:15.904
Hey there. mon El.

888
01:17:18.176 --> 01:17:19.552
Where are you going?

889
01:17:21.888 --> 01:17:22.888
Shit.

890
01:17:29.771 --> 01:17:31.851
That's the last of them
for the holding cells.

891
01:17:32.899 --> 01:17:34.484
All that's left to do is wait for...

892
01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:01.885
Damn.

893
01:18:02.136 --> 01:18:04.556
I vote they all
get in as full legionnaires.

894
01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:20.029
I'm sorry we couldn't bring
Krypton back.

895
01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:22.906
Or your mother.

896
01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:25.118
If you want.

897
01:18:25.702 --> 01:18:28.705
I could start researching
a way to replicate the machine.

898
01:18:31.666 --> 01:18:34.711
I mean. logically.
it would be a terrible idea but...

899
01:18:36.504 --> 01:18:37.504
It's okay.

900
01:18:37.839 --> 01:18:39.591
Earth's not so bad. It's...

901
01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:42.343
Definitely got a couple of good points.

902
01:18:45.305 --> 01:18:46.305
Interesting.

903
01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:50.101
In the name of research.
we better add to those points.

904
01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:52.145
Genius idea.

905
01:21:43.483 --> 01:21:45.777
And then duplicate girl shot him!

906
01:21:46.444 --> 01:21:47.570
And then she shot him again.

907
01:21:47.987 --> 01:21:50.990
In retrospect. I think it was a mistake
to let her keep that gun.

908
01:21:51.074 --> 01:21:53.242
But saturn girl was still thrilled!

909
01:21:53.326 --> 01:21:54.577
That's great. Kara.

910
01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.621
Seems like being
a legionnaire really suits you.

911
01:21:58.498 --> 01:22:02.502
Oh. and brainy's been making tons
of upgrades on legion hq.

912
01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:05.505
including rigging up the time bubbles
so we can talk more.

913
01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:06.631
Here. hold on.

914
01:22:07.632 --> 01:22:09.175
What are you... Kara.

915
01:22:09.634 --> 01:22:12.345
Kal. I'd like you to meet brainiac 5.

916
01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:16.557
the universe's only 12th-level intellect
and my boyfriend.

917
01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:20.436
It's... it's an honor to meet you.

918
01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.562
I mean. talk...

919
01:22:21.646 --> 01:22:23.231
Uh...

920
01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:24.606
Sir.

921
01:22:25.525 --> 01:22:28.069
I'm happy to meet you. brainiac 5.

922
01:22:29.028 --> 01:22:30.380
Uh. but if you two will excuse me.

923
01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:33.032
I've got to get back to being...
Superman.

924
01:22:35.201 --> 01:22:37.036
- Of course.
- Bye. kal.

925
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:38.370
Talk soon.

926
01:22:39.497 --> 01:22:40.665
You didn't tell her?

927
01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:45.086
How am I supposed to ask
her to come back to the 2ist century

928
01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:47.630
when we still don't know
what's happening?
