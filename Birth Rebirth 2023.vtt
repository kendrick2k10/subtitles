- Hmm?

58
00:05:29.812 --> 00:05:32.470
Why don't you just lie down
in the lounge?

59
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.437
'Cause the floor's softer here.

60
00:05:34.437 --> 00:05:38.096
It's unsanitary.
Come on. let's go.

61
00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:41.893
I'm here for you.
-  Oh. God.

66
00:05:50.177 --> 00:05:52.628
Okay. Alright. checking.

Hey. baby! Wa-pa!

69

So. how was your day?

72
00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.018
We played
"What Time Is It. Mr. Fox?"

73
00:06:04.018 --> 00:06:05.813
- You did?
- We made flowers.

74
00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:07.505
We sang "Open Shut Them."

75
00:06:07.505 --> 00:06:09.058
I made candy necklaces.

76
00:06:09.058 --> 00:06:11.750
I peed.
And I played L.O.L.s.

77
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.683
And I read a book.

78
00:06:13.683 --> 00:06:16.479
It was about spiders.
- Oh. yeah?

79
00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.137
- And Anansi was a spider.
- Oh. was she now?

80
00:06:19.137 --> 00:06:20.725
That's good.

81
00:06:20.725 --> 00:06:21.898
You miss this?

82
00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:23.693
I miss the little voices.

83
00:06:23.693 --> 00:06:25.799
This is gonna take a minute.

84
00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:27.145
Yeah? Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

85
00:06:27.145 --> 00:06:28.595
- All right.
- Bye. "Lee-lee."

86
00:06:28.595 --> 00:06:30.666
Bye!

87
00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:32.806
So. Anansi was a spider.

88
00:06:32.806 --> 00:06:35.084
How about this apple
that you did not eat. huh?

89
00:06:35.084 --> 00:06:37.569
- Can we get a spider?
- Aren't spiders scary?

90
00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:39.468
- No. they're crawly.
- Oh. yeah?

91
00:06:39.468 --> 00:06:40.883
What? How? Crawly how?
Like that?

92
00:06:40.883 --> 00:06:42.816
And like this? And like this?
And like this?

93
00:06:42.816 --> 00:06:45.508
And like-- Ohh! Ohh!

94
00:06:58.107 --> 00:07:00.143
Lee-Lee!

95
00:07:02.283 --> 00:07:05.632
Hands to yourself.
- I like her dress.

96
00:07:05.632 --> 00:07:08.186
I'm so sorry. ma'am.

97
00:07:08.186 --> 00:07:10.188
Come on.

98
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.849
- Mommy?
- Yes. baby?

99
00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:18.886
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Of course.

100
00:07:18.886 --> 00:07:21.544
I'm not getting
enough attention.

101
00:07:49.538 --> 00:07:54.715
I'll have the Cobb salad.
no bacon. no chicken.

102
00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:56.821
And no egg.

103
00:08:01.032 --> 00:08:03.206
I would have eaten your bacon.

104
00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:09.765
You shouldn't.

105
00:08:09.765 --> 00:08:12.181
Why not?

106
00:08:12.181 --> 00:08:13.941
I would guess you have
a buildup of plaque

107
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:15.943
in your systemic arteries.

108
00:08:17.945 --> 00:08:20.258
Right.

109
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:25.608
Hey.

110
00:08:25.608 --> 00:08:28.335
Come here.

111
00:08:35.825 --> 00:08:38.759
I'd like to masturbate you
in the bathroom.

112
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.087
I-I don't have any money.

113
00:08:56.087 --> 00:08:58.917
- I told you not to look.
- Oh. sorry.

114
00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.824
Ahh. Ahh.

115
00:09:12.862 --> 00:09:14.864
What is that?
- A sex toy.

116
00:09:14.864 --> 00:09:17.177
Don't look or I'll stop.
- Okay. O--

00:15:15.328 --> 00:15:17.571
for the next couple of hours
and I want to say good night.

182
00:15:20.747 --> 00:15:23.612
Pauline? Pauline?

183
00:15:23.612 --> 00:15:25.303
Pauline. you're cutting--

184
00:15:25.303 --> 00:15:27.271
Hey. Caroline's trying to feed.
She's asking for you.

185
00:15:27.271 --> 00:15:29.307
One minute.
Pauline. I'm sorry.

186
00:15:29.307 --> 00:15:31.344
I got to go.

187
00:15:31.344 --> 00:15:34.450
Thank you. You're a saint.

188
00:16:30.679 --> 00:16:34.372
Pauline? Lila?

189
00:16:36.443 --> 00:16:39.308
Pauline? Lila?

190
00:17:15.689 --> 00:17:17.553
Pathology.

191
00:17:47.618 --> 00:17:52.140
It's coded for the OCME.

192
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.521
- She's an organ donor?
- Yeah.

193
00:17:54.521 --> 00:17:57.145
The sheet's there on top.

194
00:17:57.145 --> 00:17:59.630
Maybe she can help
another kid out there.

195
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.151
She can't. She died
of bacterial meningitis.

196
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:06.637
That's why she's coded
for the OCME.

197
00:18:06.637 --> 00:18:11.366
I wonder if brain death
preceded organ failure.

198
00:18:11.366 --> 00:18:14.714
I really wouldn't know.

199
00:18:14.714 --> 00:18:16.750
You can leave now.

200
00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:39.463
You'll need to take this
twice a day

201
00:18:39.463 --> 00:18:40.947
for the next two days.

202
00:18:40.947 --> 00:18:43.363
- What is it?
- It's antibiotics.

203
00:18:43.363 --> 00:18:46.263
If you've contracted anything
from being with her today.

204
00:18:46.263 --> 00:18:48.851
this will take care of it 100%.

205
00:18:48.851 --> 00:18:51.268
It's important
you both take this.

206
00:18:51.268 --> 00:18:53.856
I know this is a lot.

207
00:18:53.856 --> 00:18:56.273
Can you make sure
she got everything I said?

208
00:19:02.555 --> 00:19:05.696
<i>- Mija--</i>
- I heard her.

209
00:19:05.696 --> 00:19:08.526
You want me to call someone?

210
00:19:08.526 --> 00:19:10.770
You can go home now.

211
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.289
I'm not leaving you.

212
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:14.774
Get the fuck out of my face. Pauline.

213
00:19:29.651 --> 00:19:32.585
That's perfectly appropriate.
That's what's hot this season.

214
00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:34.621
What do you have
to say about the workplace?

215
00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:37.900
Bikini tops in the workplace?
Absolutely.

216
00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:41.516
- Hey!

217
00:20:41.516 --> 00:20:44.001
You're not allowed in here.

218
00:20:44.001 --> 00:20:45.658
I'm sorry.

219
00:20:45.658 --> 00:20:47.004
If you have a records request.

220
00:20:47.004 --> 00:20:48.833
you need to file it
through admin.

221
00:20:48.833 --> 00:20:52.527
I need to see my daughter.

222
00:20:52.527 --> 00:20:54.356
Meningitis?

223
00:20:54.356 --> 00:20:57.980
Lila Morales. Is she there?

224
00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.432
She was sent to the medical
examiner an hour ago.

225
00:21:01.432 --> 00:21:03.814
Would you like their number?

226
00:21:03.814 --> 00:21:09.371
Hmm.

227
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:11.546
You can try them. but they're
usually closed on weekends.

228
00:21:14.687 --> 00:21:16.551
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

229
00:21:18.967 --> 00:21:21.383
No.

230
00:21:41.955 --> 00:21:46.719
Hey.

231
00:21:46.719 --> 00:21:48.893
Can I join you?

232
00:21:57.385 --> 00:21:59.697
Any other cases in the daycare?

233
00:21:59.697 --> 00:22:02.631
No. not that I heard.

234
00:22:04.392 --> 00:22:07.395
My phone died.

235
00:22:07.395 --> 00:22:11.709
I could have used the hospital
phone to check in. but...

236
00:22:11.709 --> 00:22:14.816
I don't know.
Maybe I liked it.

237
00:22:14.816 --> 00:22:16.749
Like a little vacation.

238
00:22:16.749 --> 00:22:19.130
This is not your fault.

239
00:22:21.201 --> 00:22:25.758
She was gone before I got here.

240
00:22:25.758 --> 00:22:27.829
I didn't get to see her.

241
00:22:31.798 --> 00:22:34.076
Let me take you home.

242
00:23:04.866 --> 00:23:07.558
Celie.

243
00:23:07.558 --> 00:23:10.561
We're here.

244
00:23:10.561 --> 00:23:11.976
<i>You've reached the office</i>

245
00:23:11.976 --> 00:23:14.462
<i>of the
Bronx County Medical Examiner.</i>

246
00:23:14.462 --> 00:23:16.878
<i>Our office is currently closed.</i>

247
00:23:16.878 --> 00:23:18.673
<i>If you'd like to leave
a message. please--</i>

248
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.241
<i>It's me. We're in the ICU.</i>

249
00:23:39.245 --> 00:23:42.179
<i>Sweetie. we're in a taxicab
heading to the hosp--</i>

250
00:23:44.457 --> 00:23:46.010
<i>Hey. I'm so sorry
to bother you.</i>

251
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.151
<i>but Lila's getting sicker.
I'm not sure--</i>

252
00:23:52.223 --> 00:23:56.780
<i>Hey. Mami. your baby's here.
and she wanted to talk to you.</i>

253
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.195
<i>Come here.</i>

254
00:23:58.195 --> 00:24:00.197
<i>Say hi to Mommy's machine.</i>

255
00:24:02.786 --> 00:24:05.202
<i>- Mommy.
- She's not there.</i>

256
00:24:05.202 --> 00:24:08.032
<i>Leave a message.
- I slept a lot.</i>

257
00:24:08.032 --> 00:24:10.138
<i>and I had a dream
about a swamp.</i>

258
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.799
<i>What else?</i>

259
00:24:28.915 --> 00:24:31.884
Your daughter's name?

260
00:24:31.884 --> 00:24:33.851
Lila Morales.

261
00:24:36.544 --> 00:24:39.754
Date of birth?

262
00:24:39.754 --> 00:24:42.757
August 9. 2015.

263
00:24:45.794 --> 00:24:48.038
Are you the sole
custodial parent?

264
00:24:50.696 --> 00:24:52.698
I'm sorry?

265
00:24:52.698 --> 00:24:54.872
Your daughter's father--
is he...?

266
00:24:54.872 --> 00:24:56.909
I had IVF. It's just us.

267
00:25:02.604 --> 00:25:04.848
Okay. that's it.

268
00:25:04.848 --> 00:25:06.815
Um. it'll take a minute.

269
00:25:06.815 --> 00:25:09.059
It's just loading.

270
00:25:22.935 --> 00:25:26.352
- What is it?

271
00:25:26.352 --> 00:25:30.011
This is saying...

272
00:25:30.011 --> 00:25:32.323
she's not here.

273
00:25:32.323 --> 00:25:34.567
- Excuse me?
- Hang on a minute.

274
00:25:42.092 --> 00:25:44.957
Do you remember a little girl
who passed away last Friday?

275
00:25:44.957 --> 00:25:46.199
You spoke with the mother.

276
00:25:46.199 --> 00:25:47.649
What's the issue?

277
00:25:47.649 --> 00:25:49.133
They say they don't have her.

278
00:25:49.133 --> 00:25:52.999
- Yeah. Not great.

279
00:25:52.999 --> 00:25:55.657
And I'm trying to figure out
what to tell the mother.

280
00:25:55.657 --> 00:25:57.210
She's in my office.

281
00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.179
Trying to come up with something
more comforting than.

282
00:26:00.179 --> 00:26:04.045
"The city of New York has
temporarily lost your daughter."

283
00:26:04.045 --> 00:26:08.118
Uh. well. you can tell her
their record keeping is a mess.

284
00:26:08.118 --> 00:26:10.810
Last year. they accidentally
cremated that Polish woman.

285
00:26:13.088 --> 00:26:15.781
Thanks. I got it.

286
00:26:20.958 --> 00:26:24.237
Ms. Morales. I promise you
we're doing everything we can.

287
00:26:24.237 --> 00:26:27.240
No. no. I am not leaving here
until I talk to somebody

288
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.898
who can tell me
where my fucking daughter is!

289
00:26:29.898 --> 00:26:32.211
I cannot imagine
how upsetting this must be.

290
00:26:32.211 --> 00:26:35.007
- I want to talk to that woman.
- I'm sorry? Which woman?

291
00:26:35.007 --> 00:26:36.664
The one who saw Lila.

292
00:26:36.664 --> 00:26:38.735
Dr. Casper.
Well. I'm happy--

293
00:26:38.735 --> 00:26:41.323
I want to talk to her now!

294
00:26:45.017 --> 00:26:47.985
I'm sorry.
She was just in here.

295
00:26:53.232 --> 00:26:56.856
Hey!

296
00:26:56.856 --> 00:26:58.789
Hey. hold on a minute!

297
00:26:58.789 --> 00:27:00.998
Hey!

298
00:27:00.998 --> 00:27:03.276
Hold on a minute.
I want to talk to you.

299
00:27:07.384 --> 00:27:09.179
Hold on.

300
00:27:09.179 --> 00:27:10.801
It'll only take a second.
Please?

301
00:28:19.042 --> 00:28:22.217
Dr. Casper?
- Who are you?

302
00:28:22.217 --> 00:28:25.324
You don't know?

303
00:28:25.324 --> 00:28:27.429
You ran away from me
the other day.

304
00:28:30.398 --> 00:28:33.366
There's a complete chain
of custody for the entire time

305
00:28:33.366 --> 00:28:35.023
your daughter was
in the hospital's care.

306
00:28:35.023 --> 00:28:37.992
Look. things got fucked up.
I'm not gonna sue.

307
00:28:37.992 --> 00:28:39.303
I don't want any trouble.

308
00:28:39.303 --> 00:28:43.100
I just need to know
what happened.

309
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.103
I ca-- I can't.

310
00:28:46.103 --> 00:28:48.830
- Can't what?
- I-- I can't help you.

311
00:28:52.834 --> 00:28:55.803
I need to get inside.
- I'd like to come in.

312
00:28:55.803 --> 00:28:57.218
I don't think
that's appropriate.

313
00:28:57.218 --> 00:28:58.564
Excuse me. please.
- What's in there?

314
00:28:58.564 --> 00:29:01.084
Will you let me into my house?!

315
00:29:01.084 --> 00:29:03.017
Okay. Okay.

316
00:29:08.194 --> 00:29:11.197
Ow!

317
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.319
I can explain.

318
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:33.012
And if you'll just--

319
00:29:33.012 --> 00:29:35.118
Don't you fucking touch her!

320
00:29:35.118 --> 00:29:37.292
I have to examine her.
or she'll die.

321
00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:42.953
She's alive.

322
00:29:53.584 --> 00:29:58.072
This cannula's been kinking
every time she shifts.

323
00:30:01.869 --> 00:30:04.147
She's alive?

324
00:30:04.147 --> 00:30:06.218
Yes. I told you that.

325
00:30:08.979 --> 00:30:13.087
But... how is this possible?

326
00:30:14.985 --> 00:30:17.125
Your daughter's genetic profile

327
00:30:17.125 --> 00:30:18.886
made her a perfect candidate

328
00:30:18.886 --> 00:30:21.612
for an experimental treatment
I've been working on.

329
00:30:21.612 --> 00:30:23.994
For meningitis?

330
00:30:23.994 --> 00:30:25.996
For death.

331
00:30:30.621 --> 00:30:32.209
What was that?

332
00:30:32.209 --> 00:30:35.074
That's Muriel.

333
00:30:35.074 --> 00:30:37.076
She died two months ago.

334
00:30:53.403 --> 00:30:56.406
Is that what you're feeding
Lila?

335
00:30:56.406 --> 00:30:58.995
This serum was derived
from fetal pigs.

336
00:30:58.995 --> 00:31:01.100
but the-- the principles
are the same.

337
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:05.173
It triggers cell regeneration.

338
00:31:05.173 --> 00:31:10.627
Well. what about brain
and personality?

339
00:31:10.627 --> 00:31:12.318
I didn't know her
before she died.

340
00:31:12.318 --> 00:31:15.390
And she's a pig.

341
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.151
I'm talking about Lila.

342
00:31:20.913 --> 00:31:24.572
Her primitive cranial nerve
reflexes are intact.

343
00:31:24.572 --> 00:31:28.127
So she could wake up.

344
00:31:28.127 --> 00:31:30.060
Theoretically. yes.

345
00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.476
But there are
ethical considerations.

346
00:31:32.476 --> 00:31:34.927
If Muriel had woken up
in pain or distress.

347
00:31:34.927 --> 00:31:36.998
I would have put her down.

348
00:31:36.998 --> 00:31:39.138
But she didn't.

349
00:31:39.138 --> 00:31:41.209
No.

350
00:31:44.143 --> 00:31:46.352
Ms. Morales.

351
00:31:46.352 --> 00:31:48.561
this experiment
is bigger than your daughter--

352
00:31:48.561 --> 00:31:51.047
or you or me.

353
00:31:51.047 --> 00:31:52.738
Y-You made her an organ donor.

354
00:31:52.738 --> 00:31:54.567
which I really admire.

355
00:31:54.567 --> 00:31:57.363
My daughter
is not an experiment.

356
00:32:09.306 --> 00:32:11.964
This line--
how long has it been kinking?

357
00:32:11.964 --> 00:32:13.483
Uh. every time she shifts.

358
00:32:13.483 --> 00:32:15.347
Well. it's too short.

359
00:32:15.347 --> 00:32:17.280
It needs an extension.

360
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.075
How often do you turn her?

361
00:32:19.075 --> 00:32:20.490
Every few hours when I'm here.

362
00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.250
I-I'm not able to be here
all the time.

363
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:25.391
She can't be left alone ever.

364
00:32:28.636 --> 00:32:31.121
Do you have a pull-out?

365
00:32:31.121 --> 00:32:33.537
I have a futon.

366
00:33:26.383 --> 00:33:29.386
Looking good for 10 weeks.

367
00:33:29.386 --> 00:33:31.147
Strong heartbeat.

368
00:33:31.147 --> 00:33:34.460
Everything's where it should be.

369
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.669
Mom's in great shape. too.
for her age.

370
00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:39.120
What's your secret?

371
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.673
Is that the placenta?

372
00:33:40.673 --> 00:33:42.744
That is. Good eye.

373
00:33:45.575 --> 00:33:47.611
Would you like a printout?

374
00:33:47.611 --> 00:33:50.373
No.

375
00:33:50.373 --> 00:33:52.271
How are you feeling?

376
00:33:52.271 --> 00:33:54.411
Are you experiencing
any discomfort?

377
00:33:54.411 --> 00:33:57.242
Nausea. some vomiting.
Nothing unusual.

378
00:33:57.242 --> 00:33:59.830
You've been pregnant before?

379
00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.349
Yes.

380
00:34:01.349 --> 00:34:04.525
Are we done?
- Uh. yeah. we're all set.

381
00:34:04.525 --> 00:34:05.871
You can get changed.

382
00:34:05.871 --> 00:34:09.081
and the doctor will be
right with you.

383
00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:11.256
Oh. I'll just give you
some privacy.

384
00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:29.550
I'm home!

385
00:34:36.108 --> 00:34:38.524
She was smiling today.

386
00:34:38.524 --> 00:34:40.492
It's a primitive reflex.

387
00:34:40.492 --> 00:34:42.597
I know. but it's a good sign.

388
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.502
How was work?

389
00:34:50.502 --> 00:34:53.608
I found an undigested spoon
inside a man's stomach.

390
00:34:57.854 --> 00:34:59.718
Come here.

391
00:34:59.718 --> 00:35:04.826
Come on. Sit.

392
00:35:04.826 --> 00:35:07.933
Oh. yes! Good.

393
00:35:07.933 --> 00:35:10.384
How long have you been
doing that?

394
00:35:10.384 --> 00:35:12.938
A few days.
She's a fast learner.

395
00:35:12.938 --> 00:35:14.629
I saw this video online.

396
00:35:14.629 --> 00:35:17.598
It said only the smartest
little piggies could do it.

397
00:35:18.944 --> 00:35:21.843
How many of those
have you given her total?

398
00:35:21.843 --> 00:35:24.398
Uhh... a few handfuls?

399
00:35:24.398 --> 00:35:27.228
A handful isn't a unit
of measurement.

400
00:35:27.228 --> 00:35:28.643
She's on a specific diet.

401
00:35:28.643 --> 00:35:31.543
If you alter it in any way.
I need to know.

402
00:35:31.543 --> 00:35:33.407
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

403
00:35:33.407 --> 00:35:35.478
Just... record it.

404
00:35:40.586 --> 00:35:42.726
Are you working out there?

405
00:35:42.726 --> 00:35:46.454
I was planning to.

406
00:35:46.454 --> 00:35:49.561
Well. she's been gassy.

407
00:35:49.561 --> 00:35:52.736
so you'll have to turn her
over a few times.

408
00:35:57.016 --> 00:35:59.433
I'll be back after 8:00
with everything on the list.

409
00:35:59.433 --> 00:36:01.676
There's salad in the fridge.

410
00:37:36.495 --> 00:37:38.670
Sit.

00:39:08.622 --> 00:39:10.796
- Get it on the schedule.
- Okay.

426
00:39:10.796 --> 00:39:13.454
Sounds good. Doctor.

427
00:39:13.454 --> 00:39:15.007
- Celie.
- Hey.

428
00:39:15.007 --> 00:39:17.631
I-I didn't know you were back.

429
00:39:17.631 --> 00:39:19.943
Yeah. I'm just heading out now.

430
00:39:19.943 --> 00:39:21.911
You working overnights?

431
00:39:21.911 --> 00:39:26.433
Bouncing around.
Mostly prenatal admin stuff.

432
00:39:26.433 --> 00:39:29.056
Did you get my calls?

433
00:39:29.056 --> 00:39:30.782
- I'm sorry.
- No.

434
00:39:30.782 --> 00:39:32.887
I-I just wanted to make
sure you have people around.

435
00:39:32.887 --> 00:39:35.994
I'm doing okay.

436
00:39:35.994 --> 00:39:38.893
I didn't hear anything
about a service.

437
00:39:38.893 --> 00:39:40.170
There wasn't a service.

438
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.034
But you'll have one.

439
00:39:42.034 --> 00:39:43.898
We're not religious.

440
00:39:43.898 --> 00:39:47.143
Oh. Okay.

441
00:39:47.143 --> 00:39:49.801
It's really nice to see you.
Take care.

442
00:39:54.737 --> 00:39:56.773
Hello?

443
00:39:56.773 --> 00:39:58.016
I'm home!

444
00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.918
Hello?!

445
00:40:03.918 --> 00:40:06.093
I'm home!

446
00:40:13.238 --> 00:40:15.447
Did you get everything?

447
00:40:15.447 --> 00:40:17.932
Yes.

448
00:40:17.932 --> 00:40:19.900
Are you okay?

449
00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.972
I'm fine.

450
00:40:45.477 --> 00:40:47.755
ECMO port capped.

451
00:40:51.103 --> 00:40:53.554
Turning off ventilator.

452
00:40:53.554 --> 00:40:55.970
Okay. here we go.

453
00:41:11.158 --> 00:41:12.711
She's not breathing.

454
00:41:12.711 --> 00:41:15.093
Just wait.

455
00:41:27.692 --> 00:41:31.558
Oh!

456
00:41:54.201 --> 00:41:56.893
- What is this?
- I made soup.

457
00:41:56.893 --> 00:41:59.758
It smells like meat.

458
00:41:59.758 --> 00:42:01.311
Mine is chicken and rice.

459
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:04.142
Yours is celery and nothing.

460
00:42:12.322 --> 00:42:13.772
This is a miracle.

461
00:42:13.772 --> 00:42:16.257
Please don't use that word.

462
00:42:16.257 --> 00:42:17.983
- Sorry?
- There's nothing supernatural

463
00:42:17.983 --> 00:42:19.329
or fantastical about it.

464
00:42:19.329 --> 00:42:21.642
This is good science
and hard work over time.

465
00:42:21.642 --> 00:42:22.850
I only meant that--

466
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:25.094
I understand
the colloquialism.

467
00:42:27.752 --> 00:42:30.064
How long have you
been working on this?

468
00:42:33.689 --> 00:42:34.897
It's hard to say.

469
00:42:34.897 --> 00:42:38.970
I-- I suppose
since I was quite young.

470
00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:42.249
About 6. maybe 7?

471
00:42:42.249 --> 00:42:43.802
Second grade?

472
00:42:43.802 --> 00:42:46.633
My mother.
She taught biology.

473
00:42:50.291 --> 00:42:53.294
She would take me
on nature trips.

474
00:42:53.294 --> 00:42:56.263
Discovery expeditions.

475
00:42:56.263 --> 00:42:58.990
When I was 6.
we went to Orchard Beach

476
00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.993
and we found a starfish.

477
00:43:01.993 --> 00:43:03.857
Apparently I was
very taken with it.

478
00:43:03.857 --> 00:43:05.928
so we brought it back home.

479
00:43:05.928 --> 00:43:08.827
She laid it out
on butcher paper.

480
00:43:08.827 --> 00:43:13.004
and she told me
to cut off its arm.

481
00:43:13.004 --> 00:43:15.696
I-I spent the whole year
measuring the arm every day.

482
00:43:15.696 --> 00:43:18.009
I'd think my eyes
were playing tricks on me.

483
00:43:18.009 --> 00:43:22.013
but the data showed
that this creature

484
00:43:22.013 --> 00:43:24.981
was fixing itself.

485
00:43:24.981 --> 00:43:28.053
Regenerating.

486
00:43:28.053 --> 00:43:30.711
Later at school.
I tried to amputate

487
00:43:30.711 --> 00:43:31.919
the leg of the class hamster.

488
00:43:31.919 --> 00:43:34.197
- It wasn't funny.

489
00:43:34.197 --> 00:43:35.751
No. no. I know.

490
00:43:35.751 --> 00:43:37.235
The animal squealed.
then bled out.

491
00:43:37.235 --> 00:43:39.651
It was awful.

492
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.415
Where is she now? Your mom?

493
00:43:48.315 --> 00:43:50.420
She died.

494
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.320
Of Parkinson's.

495
00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.116
I'm sorry.

496
00:43:57.462 --> 00:44:00.085
Thank you for the broth.

497
00:44:02.122 --> 00:44:04.055
Good night.

498
00:44:31.013 --> 00:44:33.981
Hey.

499
00:44:33.981 --> 00:44:36.708
Your mommy forget to feed you?

500
00:44:36.708 --> 00:44:38.848
Come on.

501
00:44:38.848 --> 00:44:41.299
Let's see what we got
for you here.

502
00:44:47.961 --> 00:44:49.341
Hello?

503
00:44:51.171 --> 00:44:55.382
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

504
00:44:55.382 --> 00:44:57.246
That was oncology.

505
00:44:57.246 --> 00:44:59.351
Did you call up the biopsy
results from yesterday?

506
00:44:59.351 --> 00:45:01.526
Yes.

507
00:45:01.526 --> 00:45:03.908
Wait. No.

508
00:45:03.908 --> 00:45:06.220
I-I didn't.

509
00:45:16.437 --> 00:45:18.129
Are you okay?

510
00:45:18.129 --> 00:45:21.511
Why?

511
00:45:21.511 --> 00:45:24.204
You're smiling.

512
00:45:27.379 --> 00:45:28.864
I'll get it done.

513
00:45:28.864 --> 00:45:31.107
I just have to finish
with this oth--

514
00:45:44.155 --> 00:45:47.261
Rose?

515
00:45:47.261 --> 00:45:49.332

Who am I talking to?

528
00:47:24.393 --> 00:47:27.430
My name is Scott Ward.
I work with Rose.

529
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.639
- Hello. Scott.
- Hi.

530
00:47:32.435 --> 00:47:34.299
Can I talk to Rose. please?

531
00:47:34.299 --> 00:47:35.922
Um. I don't know
how to say this.

532
00:47:35.922 --> 00:47:38.269
There was an incident.

533
00:47:38.269 --> 00:47:40.236
- What happened?
- I'm sorry.

534
00:47:40.236 --> 00:47:42.480
I just don't know
if I should divulge...

535
00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.102
We live together.

536
00:47:44.102 --> 00:47:45.483
Oh.

537
00:47:45.483 --> 00:47:48.003
Oh! Right.

538
00:47:48.003 --> 00:47:52.939
It seems like she's gonna be
fine. but Rose collapsed.

539
00:47:52.939 --> 00:47:54.423
She's upstairs in surgery.

540
00:47:54.423 --> 00:47:55.700

541
00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.391
I can stay and meet you
at the--

542
00:47:57.391 --> 00:47:59.290
Baby.

543
00:48:21.415 --> 00:48:22.623
Rose?

544
00:48:24.315 --> 00:48:25.454
Hold on a minute.

545
00:48:25.454 --> 00:48:28.043
I'll be right back.

546
00:48:31.046 --> 00:48:32.564
Ms. Casper?

547
00:48:32.564 --> 00:48:33.703
"Doctor."

548
00:48:33.703 --> 00:48:36.948
- Yes.
-"Dr. Casper."

549
00:48:36.948 --> 00:48:38.605
I'm sorry. Dr. Casper.

550
00:48:38.605 --> 00:48:41.573
I'm Dr. Chan.

551
00:48:41.573 --> 00:48:44.059
How long have I been here?

552
00:48:44.059 --> 00:48:45.957
Rose. relax.

553
00:48:45.957 --> 00:48:47.614
An infection developed
in your cervix.

554
00:48:47.614 --> 00:48:50.134
which spread throughout
your reproductive system.

555
00:48:50.134 --> 00:48:52.964
Will I be able to conceive?

556
00:48:56.657 --> 00:48:59.246
Can I still conceive?

557
00:49:02.249 --> 00:49:05.114
Show me my chart.

558
00:49:34.799 --> 00:49:36.663
Where were you?

559
00:49:36.663 --> 00:49:39.010
I was scared shitless.

560
00:49:41.254 --> 00:49:44.464
Rose.

561
00:49:44.464 --> 00:49:46.259
This batch is ruined.

562
00:49:46.259 --> 00:49:49.814
It needed to be centrifuged
12 hours ago.

563
00:49:49.814 --> 00:49:52.437
Where are your clothes?

564
00:49:56.752 --> 00:49:58.547
You woke her up?

565
00:49:58.547 --> 00:50:01.101
She woke up on her own.

566
00:50:10.386 --> 00:50:12.768
Mommy. Mommy.

567
00:50:16.461 --> 00:50:18.429
She shouldn't be awake.

568
00:50:21.052 --> 00:50:23.227
- Rose!

569
00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:32.443
Okay.

570
00:50:32.443 --> 00:50:34.410
Alright.

571
00:50:36.723 --> 00:50:39.864
You're lucky
you only popped three.

572
00:50:39.864 --> 00:50:42.246
You need to stay off your feet
for a few days.

573
00:50:42.246 --> 00:50:43.661
I'll be fine.

574
00:50:46.491 --> 00:50:48.873
Her behavior today.

575
00:50:48.873 --> 00:50:50.116
What did you observe?

576
00:50:50.116 --> 00:50:53.188
Uh. hand movement.

577
00:50:53.188 --> 00:50:54.879
Some eye movement.

578
00:50:54.879 --> 00:50:58.089
She was making sounds.
- Speech?

579
00:50:58.089 --> 00:51:02.576
Mm. not really. just... sounds.

580
00:51:02.576 --> 00:51:05.441
Did she seem to recognize you?

581
00:51:05.441 --> 00:51:07.478
I don't know.

582
00:51:07.478 --> 00:51:09.618
She's regenerating faster
than I expected.

583
00:51:09.618 --> 00:51:11.137
faster than Muriel.

584
00:51:11.137 --> 00:51:13.518
You make that sound
like a bad thing.

585
00:51:13.518 --> 00:51:16.625
We only have enough serum
for a few weeks.

586
00:51:16.625 --> 00:51:18.661
So we'll make more.

587
00:51:21.595 --> 00:51:27.325
You know the serum
comes from fetal tissue. yes?

588
00:51:27.325 --> 00:51:28.878
Yes.

589
00:51:28.878 --> 00:51:33.331
And you know where I get
that fetal tissue?

590
00:51:33.331 --> 00:51:37.508
I think so. yes.

591
00:51:37.508 --> 00:51:41.684
I can't make any more.

592
00:51:41.684 --> 00:51:44.929
Then what?

593
00:51:44.929 --> 00:51:47.483
I don't know yet.

594
00:51:47.483 --> 00:51:49.899
I'll figure something out.

595
00:52:06.985 --> 00:52:08.780
Did you sleep?

596
00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.506
Briefly.

597
00:52:12.888 --> 00:52:14.786
Is she due for a fresh bag?

598
00:52:14.786 --> 00:52:17.582
She doesn't need another
transfusion until Saturday.

599
00:52:17.582 --> 00:52:19.757
It <i>is</i> Saturday.

600
00:52:21.931 --> 00:52:23.692
Thank you. Would you...

601
00:52:33.322 --> 00:52:35.531
Can I get you some--
- No.

602
00:52:39.639 --> 00:52:41.882
Ah.

603
00:52:41.882 --> 00:52:46.439
You know. if you let me in.
I might be able to help.

604
00:52:46.439 --> 00:52:48.613
Any time I spend explaining
what I'm doing to you

605
00:52:48.613 --> 00:52:50.305
is time I spend not doing it.

606
00:52:50.305 --> 00:52:52.203
Well. if you'd explained things
to me before.

607
00:52:52.203 --> 00:52:55.344
we might not be
in this situation right now.

608
00:52:55.344 --> 00:52:57.726
What do you want to know?

609
00:52:57.726 --> 00:52:59.831
Well. you need
perinatal tissue. right?

610
00:52:59.831 --> 00:53:01.661
- Mm-hmm.
- Well. what about me?

611
00:53:01.661 --> 00:53:03.732
I mean. I'm her mother.
There's got to be something--

612
00:53:03.732 --> 00:53:05.251
You're not the right
blood type.

613
00:53:05.251 --> 00:53:08.012
Anything from your body
would kill her.

614
00:53:08.012 --> 00:53:09.945
Well. what about placenta
or cord blood?

615
00:53:09.945 --> 00:53:11.740
I can bring them home
from the hospital.

616
00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.742
And then what?
Hope for the best?

617
00:53:13.742 --> 00:53:15.778
Any donor would need
to match for blood type.

618
00:53:15.778 --> 00:53:17.573
as well as HLA markers.

619
00:53:17.573 --> 00:53:20.956
You don't understand how rare it
is that I matched with her.

620
00:53:20.956 --> 00:53:22.751
Well. what about
the organ donor registry?

621
00:53:22.751 --> 00:53:25.685
It's a box checked
on a driver's license.

622
00:53:25.685 --> 00:53:28.343
They don't run the full battery
of tests until postmortem.

623
00:53:28.343 --> 00:53:31.415
unless...

624
00:53:31.415 --> 00:53:35.246
What?

625
00:53:35.246 --> 00:53:37.766
Rose. what?!
- Uh...

626
00:53:37.766 --> 00:53:39.975
Watch her propofol drip
while I'm gone.

627
00:53:39.975 --> 00:53:41.425
Make sure she stays sedated.

628
00:53:41.425 --> 00:53:42.874
- Where are you going?
- Work!

629
00:53:42.874 --> 00:53:44.428

Sorry.

645
00:55:05.578 --> 00:55:07.649
We need to talk.

646
00:55:09.478 --> 00:55:11.135
I crossed the OB intake records

647
00:55:11.135 --> 00:55:15.691
with the national bone marrow
registry. and I found a match.

648
00:55:15.691 --> 00:55:18.384
Emily Parker. O negative.

649
00:55:18.384 --> 00:55:20.731
HLA markers aren't perfect.
but I can work with them.

650
00:55:20.731 --> 00:55:22.422
She's only in her
second trimester.

651
00:55:22.422 --> 00:55:24.010
but we can use
her amniotic fluid.

652
00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:25.460
She had a triple test last week.

653
00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:26.875
I botched the results.

654
00:55:26.875 --> 00:55:29.084
She'll have to come in
for an amnio.

655
00:55:29.084 --> 00:55:30.637
That's awful.

656
00:55:30.637 --> 00:55:32.467
Her actual results are fine.

657
00:55:32.467 --> 00:55:34.434
Yeah. but this woman's gonna be
pulling her hair out all week

658
00:55:34.434 --> 00:55:35.780
thinking something's wrong
with her baby.

659
00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:37.851
Amniocentesis
is a simple procedure.

660
00:55:37.851 --> 00:55:40.716
The risks to mother
and fetus are negligible.

661
00:55:40.716 --> 00:55:42.960
Emily.

662
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.168
What?

663
00:55:44.168 --> 00:55:47.620
The mother's name is Emily.

664
00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.449
Okay.

665
00:55:49.449 --> 00:55:51.934
If you have another plan.
I'd love to hear it.

666
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:19.686
Yes?
- I'm heading out.

667
00:56:19.686 --> 00:56:21.964
She's still down.
but her mash is in the fridge.

668
00:56:21.964 --> 00:56:23.103
Do you have a monitor?

669
00:56:23.103 --> 00:56:24.933
- Yes.
- Okay.

670
00:56:24.933 --> 00:56:26.866
Like I said.
her mash is in the fridge.

671
00:56:26.866 --> 00:56:29.696
If there's anything you need me
to pick up. just call or text.

672
00:56:29.696 --> 00:56:31.180
I'm in the bathroom!

673
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.872
Right. Sorry.

674
00:56:32.872 --> 00:56:35.046
I'll see you tonight.

675
00:56:55.066 --> 00:56:56.620
Good.

676
00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:57.793
And we're done.

677
00:56:57.793 --> 00:56:59.450
That's it. hon.
We're all done.

678
00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:00.831
Yeah. I know. Kev.

679
00:57:00.831 --> 00:57:02.211
So. uh. is there anything

680
00:57:02.211 --> 00:57:04.697
we need to do
or look out for short term?

681
00:57:04.697 --> 00:57:06.699
We'll know the results
in a few weeks.

682
00:57:06.699 --> 00:57:10.841
In the meantime. keep an eye out
for any cramping or spotting.

683
00:57:10.841 --> 00:57:13.982
And. uh. try not to worry
too much.

684
00:57:13.982 --> 00:57:16.260
There's no percentage
in worrying.

685
00:57:22.508 --> 00:57:23.888
Why isn't that coming off?
Is that normal?

686
00:57:23.888 --> 00:57:26.650
It's harmless.
It'll be gone in a few days.

687
00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:28.893
Yeah. It's the dye
from the disinfectant.

688
00:57:28.893 --> 00:57:30.170
It gets absorbed into the skin.

689
00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:33.277
- Where'd you read that?
- On Reddit.

690
00:57:33.277 --> 00:57:34.761
Hon. you know
there's a lot of stuff on there

691
00:57:34.761 --> 00:57:36.280
that's only gonna
make you upset.

692
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:38.213
- What. like political stuff?
- You know what I mean.

693
00:57:38.213 --> 00:57:39.973
Those forums are
all horror stories.

694
00:57:39.973 --> 00:57:41.043
They make you hysterical.

695
00:57:41.043 --> 00:57:43.080
Hysterical?

696
00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.082
I'm-- I'm gonna step out
and get a seltzer.

697
00:57:45.082 --> 00:57:46.980
You want a seltzer. hon?
- Tea.

698
00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.982
- Lemon and sugar?
- Yeah.

699
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.124
He means well.

700
00:57:53.124 --> 00:57:54.678
- Make a fist.

701
00:57:58.198 --> 00:57:59.786
Ready?
- Yeah.

702
00:57:59.786 --> 00:58:01.270
As long as you don't use
that big one.

703
00:58:03.894 --> 00:58:06.103
Is this your first?

704
00:58:06.103 --> 00:58:08.864
Um...

705
00:58:08.864 --> 00:58:12.109
We've been trying
for a really long time.

706
00:58:12.109 --> 00:58:15.077
But we've never gotten this far.

707
00:58:15.077 --> 00:58:17.045
How long you been trying?

708
00:58:17.045 --> 00:58:19.185
Three years.

709
00:58:19.185 --> 00:58:22.291
I know. We started late.

710
00:58:22.291 --> 00:58:25.536
I was older than you
when I had mine.

711
00:58:25.536 --> 00:58:27.296
- Oh. yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

712
00:58:27.296 --> 00:58:29.057
Got any pro tips.

713
00:58:29.057 --> 00:58:32.681
from one geriatric preggo
to another?

714
00:58:32.681 --> 00:58:34.338
Wherever you go.
whatever you do.

715
00:58:34.338 --> 00:58:37.134
have a direct route to the
nearest possible toilet.

716
00:58:37.134 --> 00:58:39.619
Construction site porta johns.

717
00:58:39.619 --> 00:58:42.553
diners and office buildings
with unlocked bathrooms.

718
00:58:42.553 --> 00:58:44.831
dumpsters that offer
some discretion.

719
00:58:44.831 --> 00:58:48.076

727
00:59:05.058 --> 00:59:07.682

00:59:07.682 --> 00:59:11.789

01:15:52.651 --> 01:15:54.791
- ♪ Let's go. Rangers

903
01:15:58.174 --> 01:16:01.626
Can't you give me a scrub sink?

904
01:16:04.836 --> 01:16:06.631
...and bring the futon
in here. position the...

905
01:16:06.631 --> 01:16:08.633
Rose?

906
01:16:08.633 --> 01:16:10.255
It's her spine.

907
01:16:10.255 --> 01:16:11.739
When Muriel missed her serum.

908
01:16:11.739 --> 01:16:13.396
her organs were
still regenerating.

909
01:16:13.396 --> 01:16:15.122
but her spinal nerves
were shredded.

910
01:16:15.122 --> 01:16:17.262
Her brain couldn't communicate
with the rest of her.

911
01:16:17.262 --> 01:16:19.195
That's what's happening
with Lila.

912
01:16:19.195 --> 01:16:20.817
If I could do it over.
I would double the amount

913
01:16:20.817 --> 01:16:22.198
of serum
perfusing her nervous system.

914
01:16:22.198 --> 01:16:24.890
But if we have enough
matching material.

915
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:28.273
it might compensate
for the lack of serum.

916
01:16:28.273 --> 01:16:31.414
What does that mean?

917
01:16:31.414 --> 01:16:34.106
Have you ever done
a bone marrow aspiration?

918
01:16:46.636 --> 01:16:49.018
Am I numb?

919
01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:52.435
- Did you feel that?
- No.

920
01:16:52.435 --> 01:16:54.437
You're numb.

921
01:16:57.682 --> 01:17:00.995
Ready?
- Mm.

922
01:17:00.995 --> 01:17:02.997
Here we go.

923
01:17:15.147 --> 01:17:16.804
Ugh!

924
01:17:21.257 --> 01:17:22.845
This is meat.

925
01:17:22.845 --> 01:17:24.156
You're anemic.

926
01:17:24.156 --> 01:17:27.401
I can't have you crashing
on me right now.

927
01:17:27.401 --> 01:17:30.059
I'm not gonna eat this.
I just need to sleep.

928
01:17:30.059 --> 01:17:31.785
You need iron.

929
01:17:31.785 --> 01:17:35.685
I'm gonna get in the shower
and then get to bed.

930
01:17:35.685 --> 01:17:36.962
Are you gonna be alright?

931
01:17:36.962 --> 01:17:39.240
Celie.

932
01:17:42.381 --> 01:17:45.350
I need you to know...

933
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:47.421
I tried everything.

934
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:54.877
Get some sleep.

935
01:19:14.991 --> 01:19:17.235
You want to go again?

936
01:19:17.235 --> 01:19:20.272
Let's do it again!

937
01:19:20.272 --> 01:19:23.897
Okay. Okay.

938
01:19:23.897 --> 01:19:25.519
Okay. Be careful.

939
01:19:30.351 --> 01:19:33.561
18 weeks. 5 days since revival.

940
01:19:46.816 --> 01:19:48.853
The subject is now on serum

941
01:19:48.853 --> 01:19:52.477
extracted and grown
from bone marrow.

942
01:19:52.477 --> 01:19:55.825
This substrate is not ideal.
but the change was made

943
01:19:55.825 --> 01:19:59.553
due to a deficit
of matching perinatal material.

944
01:20:10.529 --> 01:20:14.361
Attempts to isolate stem cells
from available tissue samples

945
01:20:14.361 --> 01:20:17.329
have proven unsuccessful.

946
01:20:42.113 --> 01:20:44.218
This has been a test
of motor coordination.

947
01:20:44.218 --> 01:20:47.359
ambulatory ability.
seventh attempt.

948
01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.641
It's not working.

949
01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:56.541
We would have seen
some improvement by now.

950
01:21:01.408 --> 01:21:03.237
Alright.
I can take more shifts.

951
01:21:03.237 --> 01:21:05.067
If it's a busy week.
I should be able

952
01:21:05.067 --> 01:21:06.654
to bring home more materials.
- Celie--

953
01:21:06.654 --> 01:21:08.553
You'll go back to looking
at the bone marrow registry

954
01:21:08.553 --> 01:21:11.038
and the intake records.
I can moonlight across town.

955
01:21:11.038 --> 01:21:15.387
- Celie.
- What?

956
01:21:15.387 --> 01:21:18.045
Don't take any more shifts.

957
01:21:18.045 --> 01:21:20.461
Call in.

958
01:21:20.461 --> 01:21:23.982
You're gonna want
to spend time with her now.

959
01:21:37.996 --> 01:21:40.102
Rose?

960
01:21:42.104 --> 01:21:44.382
Rose.

961
01:21:44.382 --> 01:21:48.558
Dr. Casper.

962
01:21:48.558 --> 01:21:50.491
Could I have a word?

963
01:21:58.741 --> 01:22:01.571
Did you sign this report?

964
01:22:05.748 --> 01:22:09.752
- Yes.
- Read it back to me.

965
01:22:09.752 --> 01:22:13.169
Pap tests shows
possible precancerous cells.

966
01:22:13.169 --> 01:22:15.068
I advised a biopsy.

967
01:22:15.068 --> 01:22:17.691
- Of the patient's cervix.
- Yes.

968
01:22:17.691 --> 01:22:21.626
<i>This</i> patient--
Francis Iamelli?

969
01:22:21.626 --> 01:22:23.317
Yes.

970
01:22:23.317 --> 01:22:26.769
Francis Iamelli has a penis.

971
01:22:26.769 --> 01:22:28.736
Yeah.

972
01:22:28.736 --> 01:22:30.738
He just had a weird morning.

973
01:22:30.738 --> 01:22:33.741
I must have attached
the wrong report.

974
01:22:33.741 --> 01:22:36.986
I have been...

975
01:22:36.986 --> 01:22:40.369
dealing with some...
personal issues.

976
01:22:42.233 --> 01:22:44.476
- Would you care to elaborate?
- No.

977
01:22:46.133 --> 01:22:48.170
Look. Rose.

978
01:22:48.170 --> 01:22:50.517
I know
what you're going through.

979
01:22:50.517 --> 01:22:54.141
When I was younger than you.
I lost three pregnancies.

980
01:22:54.141 --> 01:22:59.319
On the fourth one. the doctor
told me to stop trying.

981
01:22:59.319 --> 01:23:01.010
This thing that I always thought

982
01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:03.530
was gonna be
the cornerstone of my life--

983
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:06.567
I was told
it wasn't gonna happen.

984
01:23:06.567 --> 01:23:09.122
I felt like my body betrayed me.

985
01:23:09.122 --> 01:23:11.779
like I had done everything right
and it didn't matter.

986
01:23:14.299 --> 01:23:17.751
What did you do?

987
01:23:17.751 --> 01:23:21.755
It took time to process.
but I bounced back.

988
01:23:21.755 --> 01:23:23.619
I was young.

989
01:23:23.619 --> 01:23:25.621
You're young.

990
01:23:25.621 --> 01:23:28.555
As you get older.
you realize the point of life.

991
01:23:28.555 --> 01:23:31.834
It isn't just one thing.

992
01:23:31.834 --> 01:23:34.457
What is the point?

993
01:23:34.457 --> 01:23:36.218
Of life?

994
01:23:39.255 --> 01:23:43.156
I think purpose
is a moving target.

995
01:23:43.156 --> 01:23:45.848
But I find joy
in lots of things.

996
01:23:45.848 --> 01:23:49.645
In music. Montauk.

997
01:23:49.645 --> 01:23:52.648
My nieces and nephews.

998
01:23:52.648 --> 01:23:55.409
I read.

999
01:23:55.409 --> 01:23:57.791
And that's enough for you?

1000
01:24:01.174 --> 01:24:03.176
Get your shit together. Rose.

1001
01:24:03.176 --> 01:24:05.799
I'm not having
this conversation again.

1002
01:24:23.230 --> 01:24:26.440
It's okay.

1003
01:24:34.414 --> 01:24:36.726
It's okay. I'm here.

1004
01:24:40.592 --> 01:24:43.216
Mommy's here.

1005
01:25:03.201 --> 01:25:05.721
Everything's gonna be alright.

1006
01:25:05.721 --> 01:25:09.207
I promise.

1007
01:25:21.599 --> 01:25:23.739
Celie?

1008
01:26:09.992 --> 01:26:12.477
One second!

1009
01:26:17.931 --> 01:26:20.244
Hello?
- Hi.

1010
01:26:20.244 --> 01:26:22.763
It's Celie.
I was your OB nurse.

1011
01:26:22.763 --> 01:26:24.455
Yeah. Hi. Hello.

1012
01:26:24.455 --> 01:26:27.803
I'm so sorry to bother you.
Can I come in?

1013
01:26:27.803 --> 01:26:30.392
Yeah. of-- of course.
Come on in.

1014
01:26:30.392 --> 01:26:32.635
Thank you.

1015
01:26:35.776 --> 01:26:38.262
You have a beautiful home.

1016
01:26:38.262 --> 01:26:39.780
Oh. thanks so much.

1017
01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:43.439
Yeah. we have a lot
more room out here.

1018
01:26:43.439 --> 01:26:45.338
Is everything okay
with my pregnancy?

1019
01:26:45.338 --> 01:26:49.273
Oh. Yes. Yes.
Everything's perfectly fine.

1020
01:26:49.273 --> 01:26:51.275
- Jesus.
- Sorry.

1021
01:26:51.275 --> 01:26:53.725
I-- I probably should have
led with that.

1022
01:26:53.725 --> 01:26:56.970
No. um. we've had complaints
from patients

1023
01:26:56.970 --> 01:26:59.006
transferring
about not getting their records.

1024
01:26:59.006 --> 01:27:01.768
so I just wanted to make sure
you got a copy.

1025
01:27:01.768 --> 01:27:04.460
I know you haven't had
the easiest time with us. so...

1026
01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.048
Oh.

1027
01:27:06.048 --> 01:27:08.533
I really appreciate you
coming all the way out here.

1028
01:27:11.916 --> 01:27:15.506
You can get that.
- Oh... it's fine.

1029
01:27:18.509 --> 01:27:21.857
Can I offer you something?
Like water or...?

1030
01:27:24.825 --> 01:27:27.518
Tea would be nice.

1031
01:27:27.518 --> 01:27:30.831
It's weird. It's like
any drunk 12-year-old can do it.

1032
01:27:30.831 --> 01:27:33.627
but Kev and I are getting
our PhD in child rearing.

1033
01:27:35.353 --> 01:27:39.599
All we have is Irish Breakfast
tea. decaffeinated.

1034
01:27:39.599 --> 01:27:41.911
- I'm not choosy.
- Okay.

1035
01:27:45.018 --> 01:27:47.779
Ohh.

1036
01:27:47.779 --> 01:27:50.713
Are you alright?
- Yeah. Um...

1037
01:27:50.713 --> 01:27:53.371
It's gas.
- Ah.

1038
01:27:53.371 --> 01:27:54.476
No. no. no. no. It's awful.

1039
01:27:54.476 --> 01:27:55.684
Please.
- Let me take over.

1040
01:27:55.684 --> 01:27:56.961
You're gonna walk
right into it.

1041
01:27:56.961 --> 01:27:59.446
I've walked into worse.

1042
01:27:59.446 --> 01:28:01.517
So embarrassing.

1043
01:28:01.517 --> 01:28:04.071
Man.

1044
01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:06.557
Yeah. so. it hurts when I sit.

1045
01:28:06.557 --> 01:28:10.457
and then it hurts
when I [chuckling] stand up.

1046
01:28:10.457 --> 01:28:13.080
This little alien parasite

1047
01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.567
is giving me a run
for my money. I swear.

1048
01:28:16.567 --> 01:28:18.707
Lemon and sugar. yeah?

1049
01:28:18.707 --> 01:28:20.536
Yeah.

1050
01:28:20.536 --> 01:28:24.678
Right.

1051
01:28:24.678 --> 01:28:27.647
- Oh. my gosh.
- Hot.

1052
01:28:27.647 --> 01:28:31.616
It smells divine.

1053
01:28:31.616 --> 01:28:33.687
Thank you.

1054
01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:37.898
Alright. come on. come on.
come on.

1055
01:28:37.898 --> 01:28:39.452
Come on. I got you.

1056
01:28:39.452 --> 01:28:43.352
I got you. Stay with me.

1057
01:28:43.352 --> 01:28:46.942
- EMS!

1058
01:28:48.357 --> 01:28:51.774
She's right here.
37 years old.

1059
01:28:51.774 --> 01:28:54.536
Seven months pregnant.
- Get the board.

1060
01:28:54.536 --> 01:28:55.882
You make the call?
- Yeah.

1061
01:28:55.882 --> 01:28:58.091
She started seizing
10 minutes ago.

1062
01:28:58.091 --> 01:28:59.782
And she's going into labor.
- You're okay. You're okay.

1063
01:28:59.782 --> 01:29:01.405
I'm her nurse
at Bronx Memorial.

1064
01:29:01.405 --> 01:29:03.096
- What's her name?
- Emily.

1065
01:29:03.096 --> 01:29:06.410
Emily. we're gonna take
good care of you. okay?

1066
01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:07.928
You're lucky
your friend was here.

1067
01:29:09.378 --> 01:29:11.000
- Okay.

1068
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.520
Let's turn her on my count.
One. two. three.

1069
01:29:15.695 --> 01:29:19.146
Okay.

1070
01:29:19.146 --> 01:29:21.666
- You with us?

1071
01:29:21.666 --> 01:29:23.530
Nod if you're with me.

1072
01:29:23.530 --> 01:29:26.947
Okay. Okay.

1073
01:29:26.947 --> 01:29:30.054
This is gonna help you breathe.

1074
01:29:52.041 --> 01:29:55.804
Mama. eyes on me. Eyes on me.

1075
01:29:55.804 --> 01:29:57.806
Your baby's gonna be fine.
I promise you.

1076
01:29:57.806 --> 01:29:59.911
What about me?

1077
01:29:59.911 --> 01:30:01.775
What's that. Mama?

1078
01:30:01.775 --> 01:30:03.777
What about me?

1079
01:30:03.777 --> 01:30:06.159
Pressure. Come on. Let's go.

1080
01:30:06.159 --> 01:30:08.506
Suction. I've got it.

1081
01:30:21.864 --> 01:30:23.176
The baby's not breathing.

1082
01:30:25.765 --> 01:30:27.767
Let me see.

1083
01:30:29.182 --> 01:30:30.632
I need hands over here.

1084
01:30:30.632 --> 01:30:32.599
- What's wrong?
- Just belows the ribs.

1085
01:30:32.599 --> 01:30:34.912
We're dropping compression.
- Get that... suction.

1086
01:30:34.912 --> 01:30:36.810
I can't see.

1087
01:30:38.571 --> 01:30:40.504
She's seizing again.
Can I get some help here?

1088
01:30:43.127 --> 01:30:46.026
It is 100 over 65.

1089
01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:36.007
- Celie.
- Get to pathology.

1090
01:31:36.007 --> 01:31:37.284
Celie. where are you?

1091
01:31:37.284 --> 01:31:39.148
Get to pathology now.

1092
01:32:23.607 --> 01:32:25.816
Did you get everything?

1093
01:32:29.267 --> 01:32:31.304
Yes.

1094
01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:37.103
I didn't mean to kill her.

1095
01:32:37.103 --> 01:32:39.070
I just wanted to induce
so that we could--

1096
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:41.141
It doesn't matter.

1097
01:32:43.212 --> 01:32:45.905
There was nothing else
I could do.

1098
01:32:56.881 --> 01:33:00.195
Do you need to sleep?

1099
01:33:00.195 --> 01:33:02.266
I can't.

1100
01:33:04.751 --> 01:33:07.064
Then let's get to work.

1101
01:33:42.893 --> 01:33:44.273
Clear.

1102
01:33:48.450 --> 01:33:51.764
Three. two. one. Clear.

1103
01:33:55.457 --> 01:33:58.184
Okay. We're in V-fib.
Go again.

1104
01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.756
