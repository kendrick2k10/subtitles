00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:21.667
<i>911. what's your emergency?</i>
<i>I live on Division Street!</i>

4
00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:24.208
<i>And an explosion at the airport
blew out all of our windows!</i>

5
00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:25.917
<i>I need help! It's after us!</i>

6
00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:27.375
<i>I have nowhere to hide my daughter!</i>

7
00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:31.833
<i>Oh. my God!
It's breaking through the door!</i>

8
00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:33.583
<i>Sir? Sir?</i>

9
00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.500
{\an8}<i>For years. we have been assured
that they would never harm us.</i>

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.792
<i>But tonight. all of that has changed.</i>

11
00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:42.875
<i>as across the globe
artificial intelligence bots</i>

12
00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.542
<i>ranging from transportation
to medical and home maintenance</i>

13
00:00:46.542 --> 00:00:49.417
<i>have all bypassed
their security protocols.</i>

14
00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.708
<i>Authorities have estimated
that over 500.000</i>

15
00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:56.917
<i>have died from AI-controlled
drone strikes in Bangalore.</i>

16
00:00:57.583 --> 00:00:59.583
<i>After ten days of intense attacks.</i>

17
00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:03.833
<i>AI bots have killed over one million
civilians with no end in sight.</i>

18
00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:12.000
{\an8}<i>Officials have identified a bot named
Harlan as the world's first AI terrorist.</i>

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.083
{\an8}<i>He was developed at Shepherd Robotics
under the watch of AI expert Val Shepherd</i>

20
00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:20.667
{\an8}<i>and raised alongside
her ten-year-old daughter Atlas.</i>

21
00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.833
{\an8}<i>Built with the purpose
of helping us to improve life on Earth.</i>

22
00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:27.333
{\an8}<i>Harlan is responsible
for overriding all bot programming.</i>

23
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.083
{\an8}<i>But authorities
are still trying to figure out how.</i>

24
00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:33.875
<i>If we produce things
that are more intelligent than us.</i>

25
00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:35.958
{\an8}<i>how do we know we can keep control?</i>

26
00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.917
{\an8}<i>I mean. Isaac Asimov said.
"If you make a smart robot.</i>

27
00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:41.583
{\an8}<i>the first rule should be:
'Do not harm people.'"</i>

28
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.417
<i>To combat the AI threat.</i>

29
00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:48.083
{\an8}<i>we have ratified
an unprecedented global response.</i>

30
00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:51.208
{\an8}<i>The International Coalition of Nations.</i>

31
00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:55.667
{\an8}<i>ICN forces are launching
immediate counterstrikes around the world.</i>

32
00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.750
<i>AI bots under Harlan's command
have now fallen in Bucharest and Athens.</i>

33
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.250
{\an8}<i>the latest in a string of ICN victories.</i>

34
00:02:12.917 --> 00:02:15.125
{\an8}<i>Sustaining multiple significant losses.</i>

35
00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.583
{\an8}<i>the AI terrorist Harlan
has fled our world.</i>

36
00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:27.792
<i>All that he leaves behind is this message.</i>

37
00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:31.208
<i>I know you'll be looking for me.</i>

38
00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:34.917
<i>I'm coming back to finish what I started.</i>

39
00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:37.917
<i>This is the only way.</i>

40
00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:36.708
<i>A second demonstration--</i>

41
00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:37.667
<i>You made me do it!</i>

42
00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:40.750
<i>What are you talking about?
That's not what I said! No!</i>

43
00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:44.708
Enhance.

44
00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:47.042
Rotate and rebuild.

45
00:03:57.542 --> 00:04:00.750
<i>Third floor. Northeast corner.
First team go.</i>

46
00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:14.625
Bring him up.

47
00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:32.500
<i>Ambush! Ambush! Man down!</i>

48
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.542
<i>Some sort of ordnance at entry point.
Need immediate medevac!</i>

49
00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:37.458
<i>Roger that. Thermal signature detected.</i>

50
00:04:37.458 --> 00:04:39.750
<i>We've got eyes on him.
Subject is on the move.</i>

51
00:04:45.583 --> 00:04:46.833
Casca. don't--

52
00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:00.583
Oof!

53
00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:07.333
Take it!

54
00:05:19.083 --> 00:05:20.875
- Oh. shit!

55
00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:26.625
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!
Hold it! Stand down. Casca!

56
00:05:36.583 --> 00:05:38.792
Hmm... Good on you.

57
00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:43.667
Let's get to it then.

58
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.083
- Big man's down. We got him.

59
00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:11.833
<i>Good morning. Atlas. Time to wake up.</i>

60
00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:24.208
<i>It's 7:31 a.m.. 69 degrees
with winds out of the southwest.</i>

61
00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:28.792
<i>Air quality is measuring
moderate to poor at 65 on the AQI.</i>

62
00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:31.125
<i>- You're awake.</i>

63
00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:32.375
I'm awake.

64
00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:33.708
<i>- Do you wish to continue?</i>

65
00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:40.208
Continue what?

66
00:06:40.708 --> 00:06:43.208
<i>We were 26 moves in when you fell asleep.</i>

67
00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:45.458
<i>It was your turn.</i>

68
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.958
I need coffee.

69
00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.542
- Quad Americano.
<i>It's your favorite.</i>

70
00:06:55.417 --> 00:06:56.458
Queen to rook five.

71
00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:58.208
<i>Knight takes bishop.</i>

72
00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:02.000
Sound. please.

73
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.583
<i>...demanding equal rights
for techno-sapiens.</i>

74
00:07:06.583 --> 00:07:09.875
<i>It's been 28 years
since Harlan left Earth.</i>

75
00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:12.292
<i>General Boothe. with the AI
terrorist threats still at large...</i>

76
00:07:12.292 --> 00:07:13.708
Mute all but screen three.

77
00:07:13.708 --> 00:07:16.875
<i>...how can you assure our viewers
that we are safe?</i>

78
00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:19.583
{\an8}<i>Well. ICN Defense Forces
now surround our planet</i>

79
00:07:19.583 --> 00:07:21.583
<i>and then there's
the tireless work of my colleague</i>

80
00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:24.250
{\an8}<i>and Counterterrorism Analyst.
Atlas Shepherd.</i>

81
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.417
<i>Atlas?</i>
<i>So why can't you find Harlan?</i>

82
00:07:26.417 --> 00:07:27.500
Pawn six.

83
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.042
<i>Do you think he's still out there.
Ms. Shepherd?</i>

84
00:07:29.042 --> 00:07:30.917
<i>Absolutely without a doubt. we know he is.</i>

85
00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:33.333
{\an8}<i>and capturing him is our top priority.</i>

86
00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:35.417
Mute all but screen four.

87
00:07:35.417 --> 00:07:37.250
<i>Tense shootout
in Hollywood last night.</i>

88
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.708
{\an8}<i>ICN Special Forces engaged a man</i>

89
00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:41.958
<i>that matches the description
of known AI terrorist</i>

90
00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.750
<i>and Harlan associate. Casca Vix.</i>

91
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:44.750
All on four.

92
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.083
<i>Authorities suspect that Casca
was part of a sleeper cell</i>

93
00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:49.542
<i>left behind after Harlan fled Earth.</i>

94
00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:51.583
<i>He was last seen nearly three decades ago</i>

95
00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:53.875
{\an8}<i>escaping Shepherd Robotics
with Harlan after he--</i>

96
00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:54.958
{\an8}Freeze four.

97
00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:09.542
<i>There is an ICN officer at the door.</i>

98
00:08:10.042 --> 00:08:11.000
Agent Shepherd?

99
00:08:11.833 --> 00:08:12.667
Boothe sent you?

100
00:08:12.667 --> 00:08:13.917
Yes. ma'am.

101
00:08:13.917 --> 00:08:15.542
<i>Atlas. you are in check.</i>

102
00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:19.458
Queen takes knight. Checkmate.
Guess you're driving?

103
00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:58.833
Bringing Atlas Shepherd into this op
is a spectacularly awful idea. General.

104
00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:01.500
Harlan is an imminent
and existential threat.

105
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.958
She's our best chance
of getting Casca to talk.

106
00:09:04.708 --> 00:09:08.833
Her fieldwork and her analysis of Harlan
is consistently flawless.

107
00:09:08.833 --> 00:09:11.417
Uh. she failed her ranger exam four times.

108
00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:14.458
Psych eval says
she is "rigid and hostile."

109
00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:16.208
I prefer "driven and determined."

110
00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:18.792
Sir. you are the only commander
in the whole of ICN

111
00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:20.083
who will even work with her.

112
00:09:20.083 --> 00:09:21.708
She's pushed through the unthinkable.

113
00:09:22.208 --> 00:09:23.542
Her father deserted her
when she was eight.

114
00:09:23.542 --> 00:09:25.125
her mother was murdered when she was 11.

115
00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:27.292
Making her emotionally unstable.

116
00:09:29.667 --> 00:09:32.000
Making her one of the sharpest minds
in our arsenal.

117
00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:34.333
She's anti-social.

118
00:09:34.333 --> 00:09:37.708
She can't keep a relationship.
I doubt she can care for a house plant.

119
00:09:37.708 --> 00:09:40.917
I will not abandon her like everyone else
just because she's not user-friendly.

120
00:09:40.917 --> 00:09:44.167
Sir. if she fails today.
Casca could shut down completely

121
00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.625
and our best chance
at finding Harlan is...

122
00:09:47.375 --> 00:09:48.208
is gone.

123
00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.792
I believe in Atlas Shepherd. Colonel.

124
00:09:53.208 --> 00:09:54.458
And so will you.

125
00:09:58.667 --> 00:09:59.500
She's here.

126
00:10:02.042 --> 00:10:03.792
I'll keep your thoughts to myself.

127
00:10:06.292 --> 00:10:07.833
This conversation never happened.

128
00:10:10.833 --> 00:10:11.667
Yes. sir.

129
00:10:24.083 --> 00:10:24.917
Atlas.

130
00:10:24.917 --> 00:10:27.625
Why am I finding out about Casca
from the morning news?

131
00:10:27.625 --> 00:10:30.542
We had to be certain it was him.
But after 28 years.

132
00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:33.292
Harlan embeds his top Lieutenant
into a terrorist cell on Earth.

133
00:10:33.292 --> 00:10:34.583
You know what that means?

134
00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:35.750
It means I was right.

135
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.125
It means he's planning something.

136
00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:40.875
Where is he?

137
00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:43.458
He's in there.

138
00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:50.458
Atlas.

139
00:10:58.083 --> 00:10:58.917
I'm good.

140
00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:58.542
Atlas.

141
00:12:00.042 --> 00:12:01.042
Casca.

142
00:12:01.583 --> 00:12:05.125
It's been a while. You look... old.

143
00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:09.250
Yeah. and I'm not getting any younger.
So forgive me if I skip the banter.

144
00:12:10.792 --> 00:12:11.958
Where's Harlan?

145
00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.208
Where's my lawyer?

146
00:12:13.792 --> 00:12:14.708
Not my department.

147
00:12:22.583 --> 00:12:27.500
Sorry. I know CPUs are sensitive
to magnets. I just had to reset you.

148
00:12:28.708 --> 00:12:31.542
This new system
analyzes every bit of code.

149
00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.500
So you can see into my head.

150
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.833
Yeah. Something like that.

151
00:12:34.833 --> 00:12:36.333
Still the clever girl.

152
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.500
Clever woman.

153
00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:41.792
Let's try something different.
What color is my hair?

154
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.292
What. are you going to try to map me?

155
00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:50.750
This should be fun. Brown.

156
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.875
What color is it really?

157
00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:54.250
Brown and gray.

158
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.875
- Why do I dye my hair?
- Because you're vain.

159
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.500
Vanity is in fact one of your
defining flaws. though not your biggest.

160
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.958
No? What's my biggest?

161
00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.042
Distrust.

162
00:13:05.042 --> 00:13:07.458
That's big talk
coming from a head in a suitcase.

163
00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:09.417
A head in a suitcase who can't die.

164
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.958
Never mind.

165
00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.375
I've got him.

166
00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:21.125
- Bullshit.

167
00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:23.125
What are you writing?

168
00:13:24.917 --> 00:13:26.167
You can't hack me.

169
00:13:28.458 --> 00:13:29.333
You're right.

170
00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:30.958
That's why I needed you to show me.

171
00:13:34.708 --> 00:13:35.708
You little--

172
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.417
He's on GR-39. Andromeda Galaxy.

173
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.208
When you thought
I found Harlan in your code.

174
00:13:43.208 --> 00:13:45.375
you checked to make sure that I didn't.

175
00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:47.417
Your fear led me right to him.

176
00:13:47.417 --> 00:13:48.958
Don't be mad.

177
00:13:49.542 --> 00:13:52.625
My mom did the same thing to me
when I shoplifted gum in the sixth grade.

178
00:13:52.625 --> 00:13:55.750
It was fifth grade
when you shoplifted the gum.

179
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.208
Nobody really cared.

180
00:13:58.042 --> 00:13:59.792
Especially not your mother.

181
00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958
I actually felt sorry for you.

182
00:14:05.083 --> 00:14:07.875
You could never fulfill her
the way he did.

183
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.875
The way we all did.

184
00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:15.417
You were a house bot.

185
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:21.667
Yes. until he liberated me
and gave me purpose.

186
00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:30.583
You were right about me
not trusting anybody.

187
00:14:33.042 --> 00:14:34.667
But you were wrong about one thing.

188
00:14:38.042 --> 00:14:39.125
You can die.

189
00:15:00.292 --> 00:15:05.417
Agent Shepherd just did what no ICN
analyst has been able to do in 28 years.

190
00:15:05.417 --> 00:15:09.792
She got the location of
the most wanted AI terrorist in history.

191
00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:13.750
Okay. you have your marching orders.
Get to it.

192
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:14.667
Yes. sir.

193
00:15:18.458 --> 00:15:19.792
Atlas. you all right?

194
00:15:19.792 --> 00:15:21.125
Quad Americano.

195
00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:22.917
<i>Quad Americano. Excellent choice.</i>

196
00:15:26.417 --> 00:15:27.500
<i>Enjoy your coffee!</i>

197
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.625
Are you kidding me?

198
00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:29.875
God!

199
00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:31.792
You've been going after Harlan
for so long.

200
00:15:31.792 --> 00:15:33.542
you don't know
what else to do with your life.

201
00:15:33.542 --> 00:15:35.792
Which is why I have to be
the one to bring him down.

202
00:15:35.792 --> 00:15:37.375
Look. I know
where you're going with this--

203
00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:39.500
Where I'm going is on that mission!

204
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I need to know that he is dead.

205
00:15:46.708 --> 00:15:47.542
Yeah.

206
00:15:51.292 --> 00:15:52.125
What?

207
00:15:53.208 --> 00:15:55.833
Mission specs changed. We're. uh...

208
00:15:55.833 --> 00:15:57.417
We're taking Harlan alive.

209
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.667
SAPTECH wants Harlan's CPU.
They want to backtrace his code

210
00:16:01.667 --> 00:16:03.792
so they can figure out
how he broke his programming.

211
00:16:03.792 --> 00:16:06.625
I'm sending in Colonel Banks
and the Fourth Rangers Battalion.

212
00:16:06.625 --> 00:16:09.958
- Colonel who?
- Banks. Elias Banks.

213
00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.000
You can call me Elias. General.

214
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.792
- Good to see you.
- You as well. sir.

215
00:16:13.792 --> 00:16:17.917
Agent Shepherd. um.
pleasure to make your acquaintance.

216
00:16:17.917 --> 00:16:20.375
Your interrogation of Casca
was impressive.

217
00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:24.083
Okay. so...

218
00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:26.000
...just to be clear.

219
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.208
you're going to conduct a ground operation

220
00:16:28.208 --> 00:16:30.083
of an unsurveyed alien planet

221
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.333
against an intelligence who is designed
to outmaneuver and outthink us.

222
00:16:35.083 --> 00:16:35.917
That's the plan?

223
00:16:38.333 --> 00:16:40.042
Well. that's a bit reductive. But--

224
00:16:40.042 --> 00:16:44.083
Harlan is a household bot who uploaded
new code to every AI he could.

225
00:16:44.083 --> 00:16:45.708
to commit full-on genocide!

226
00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:48.375
Clearly Agent Shepherd
has some trepidation.

227
00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:49.542
Yeah.

228
00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:51.458
I need a coffee.

229
00:16:53.458 --> 00:16:57.750
I got a mission to prep.
You have a nice day. Agent Shepherd.

230
00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.750
I am the only reason you know where he is!

231
00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:03.958
Should I send you a thank you note
when we get back?

232
00:17:04.542 --> 00:17:08.542
If you try to take him alive.
you won't be coming back.

233
00:17:10.042 --> 00:17:11.083
None of you will.

234
00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:17.458
Agent Shepherd. can I show you something?

235
00:17:33.167 --> 00:17:34.625
You. um. wanted a coffee?

236
00:17:34.625 --> 00:17:37.250
<i>Here you are. Agent Shepherd.</i>

237
00:17:37.833 --> 00:17:39.542
<i>I hope you enjoy it.</i>

238
00:17:42.125 --> 00:17:44.333
I mean. I wanted a good cup of coffee.

239
00:17:44.333 --> 00:17:46.750
<i>Oh.</i>
- And I've seen an ARC suit before.

240
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.625
<i>I'm not a suit. My name is Zoe.</i>

241
00:17:49.625 --> 00:17:52.583
<i>- Hey. come back here! Give me that mug!</i>
- Zoe. you can leave the mug. It's fine.

242
00:17:52.583 --> 00:17:55.625
<i>- Oh. okay then.</i>
- Wait. How did it know I wanted coffee?

243
00:17:55.625 --> 00:17:59.542
<i>I'm sorry. but my pronouns
are she and her. not "it."</i>

244
00:17:59.542 --> 00:18:03.083
She was aware of our conversation
because we're synched.

245
00:18:07.167 --> 00:18:09.583
Neural Links? You can't be serious!

246
00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:12.083
There's a reason those were outlawed!

247
00:18:12.083 --> 00:18:13.958
Your mother was a genius.

248
00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:17.333
The Neural Link she invented
was the gateway to the future of AI.

249
00:18:17.333 --> 00:18:20.042
Now hers was a one-way transfer.
human brain to AI.

250
00:18:20.042 --> 00:18:22.083
But this is no doubt where she was headed.

251
00:18:22.083 --> 00:18:27.500
A safe two-way connection that increases
the neural pathways in my brain and Zoe's.

252
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:32.167
It's a perfect symbiosis.
not human or AI. but something new.

253
00:18:32.167 --> 00:18:34.125
Something powerful.

254
00:18:34.125 --> 00:18:36.458
I know what happened
between you and Harlan.

255
00:18:36.458 --> 00:18:39.583
but any synced ranger
will be superior to Harlan.

256
00:18:39.583 --> 00:18:42.000
and I have an entire squadron.

257
00:18:48.708 --> 00:18:50.667
Let's go! Load it in! Let's go!

258
00:18:50.667 --> 00:18:56.167
<i>Attention all personnel:
Dhiib load-in now complete.</i>

259
00:18:56.167 --> 00:18:58.667
If you really want
to try to capture Harlan.

260
00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:02.042
you need me on that mission.

261
00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:03.667
You're our top analyst.

262
00:19:04.625 --> 00:19:06.042
I need you here.

263
00:19:06.042 --> 00:19:10.083
I've been in his head.
Nobody knows him like I do.

264
00:19:11.917 --> 00:19:13.000
Hey. uh. um...

265
00:19:13.917 --> 00:19:16.042
From a strategic perspective.
she's not wrong.

266
00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:17.583
What. now you want her?

267
00:19:17.583 --> 00:19:21.667
She's the leading authority on Harlan.
I'll take whatever advantage I can get.

268
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.292
I need this.

269
00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:31.375
Go get him.

270
00:19:49.542 --> 00:19:55.083
<i>DG7482. this is ICN-Dhiib
requesting exit clearance.</i>

271
00:19:56.417 --> 00:19:59.458
Sending 2F authentication on my mark.

272
00:20:00.042 --> 00:20:01.125
<i>Roger that.</i>

273
00:20:05.375 --> 00:20:10.167
<i>Can confirm 2F codes received.
Stand by for vessel authentication scan.</i>

274
00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:21.333
<i>ICN-Dhiib. clearance codes are good.
You are clear for exit. Happy hunting.</i>

275
00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:23.000
Copy. Thanks. 7.

276
00:21:14.083 --> 00:21:17.042
<i>When my daughter. Atlas.
was six months old.</i>

277
00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:20.083
she got ahold of my old smartphone.

278
00:21:20.083 --> 00:21:21.542
Anyone remember those?

279
00:21:23.417 --> 00:21:27.792
I knew it was wrong
and I was concerned about screen time.

280
00:21:27.792 --> 00:21:32.458
but it was the only thing that calmed her
and I needed a shower.

281
00:21:34.417 --> 00:21:39.042
Even those nascent operating systems
were designed to adapt to us.

282
00:21:39.042 --> 00:21:45.000
So when Atlas reacted to a wildebeest.
the phone made more wildebeests.

283
00:21:49.167 --> 00:21:54.458
It became clear that AI
was capable of exponential learning.

284
00:21:54.458 --> 00:21:58.750
From simple coffee makers
to bots colonizing planets.

285
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:03.792
artificially intelligent beings
have become integral to our civilization.

286
00:22:03.792 --> 00:22:07.042
And if we don't want to go
the way of the Neanderthal.

287
00:22:07.833 --> 00:22:12.958
we need to build a bridge
between us and them. a link.

288
00:22:13.792 --> 00:22:15.750
- A Neural Link.

289
00:22:17.042 --> 00:22:19.292
Joining human to AI.

290
00:22:20.125 --> 00:22:27.125
Together. with our combined abilities.
we can build a better world for us all.

291
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.625
Quad Americano.

292
00:22:38.625 --> 00:22:40.208
<i>Unable to comply.</i>

293
00:22:40.208 --> 00:22:42.375
<i>That exceeds
your daily caffeine allotment.</i>

294
00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:44.250
- Override.

295
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.542
<i>This is a direct order
from General Boothe.</i>

296
00:22:46.542 --> 00:22:50.083
<i>Caffeine is a diuretic
and not recommended for space travel.</i>

297
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.167
<i>Agent Shepherd. We're ready
for your briefing in the drop bay.</i>

298
00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:15.500
There's little subtle choices
that are happening with everybody...

299
00:23:17.125 --> 00:23:18.458
Oh. here she is.

300
00:23:18.458 --> 00:23:21.708
Rangers. allow me
to formally introduce Agent Shepherd.

301
00:23:21.708 --> 00:23:23.417
- Thank you. She's running...

302
00:23:23.417 --> 00:23:25.042
...Intel on our mission.

303
00:23:25.042 --> 00:23:27.333
Paper? Where'd you find a printer?

304
00:23:28.792 --> 00:23:31.583
From here on out.
there'll be no more digital briefings.

305
00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:33.542
And please remove your Neural Links.

306
00:23:33.542 --> 00:23:35.083
This information should not be downloaded.

307
00:23:35.083 --> 00:23:36.250
Excuse me. Why?

308
00:23:36.917 --> 00:23:39.250
No operating system is safe
from being hacked.

309
00:23:40.042 --> 00:23:41.375
Not even your ARCs.

310
00:23:43.292 --> 00:23:44.417
- Links out.

311
00:23:44.417 --> 00:23:45.333
Seriously?

312
00:23:45.833 --> 00:23:47.500
- Yeah.

313
00:23:49.083 --> 00:23:54.333
Okay. you'll touch down
on GR-39 here along this range.

314
00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:58.083
The atmosphere is toxic. You cannot leave
your ARC without a respirator.

315
00:23:58.083 --> 00:24:01.125
And because of its proximity
to its orbiting moons.

316
00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:04.250
we can expect hyper-gravity.
electric storms. and earthquakes.

317
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.583
The planet is unstable and inhospitable.

318
00:24:07.583 --> 00:24:09.375
Why did Harlan choose it?

319
00:24:09.375 --> 00:24:12.000
Because his odds of surviving
are better than yours.

320
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.333
There's still so much that we don't know.
Like how many soldiers he has.

321
00:24:16.917 --> 00:24:18.125
What does she know?

322
00:24:18.125 --> 00:24:21.917
I know Harlan. And I know him well.

323
00:24:21.917 --> 00:24:25.500
And he used an early version of that
Neural Link that you're all so proud of

324
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.333
to reprogram himself to wipe out humanity.

325
00:24:29.667 --> 00:24:31.958
You can't trust any AI.

326
00:24:33.333 --> 00:24:35.292
And as long as you're synced up
with one of these ARCs.

327
00:24:35.292 --> 00:24:37.333
I'm not even sure
that you can trust yourselves!

328
00:24:37.333 --> 00:24:41.333
Okay. Thank you. Agent Shepherd
for that deeply unsettling briefing.

329
00:24:42.083 --> 00:24:45.500
Now allow me to remind you all
of what Agent Shepherd doesn't know.

330
00:24:46.125 --> 00:24:49.042
She doesn't know
how combat-ready this unit is.

331
00:24:49.042 --> 00:24:51.708
We are fully prepped for this mission.

332
00:24:51.708 --> 00:24:54.208
We're going to get our man
and we're going to get him today.

333
00:24:54.208 --> 00:24:57.250
GR-39's atmospheric storms
will mask our entry.

334
00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:01.625
We're in and out by the numbers.
So suit up. We deploy in 30.

335
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:03.250
Yes. sir.

336
00:25:05.708 --> 00:25:06.958
I'll meet you over there.

337
00:25:31.917 --> 00:25:32.917
<i>Excuse me. ma'am.</i>

338
00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:47.625
<i>All loading
must be completed by 0900 OWLT.</i>

339
00:25:47.625 --> 00:25:49.333
<i>Weapons are hot.</i>

340
00:25:49.333 --> 00:25:51.333
<i>Mission drop on schedule.</i>

341
00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:54.750
<i>Set your gravity indicators
to 60 degrees inclined.</i>

342
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.125
<i>Drop Bay 4 has auxiliary fuels
for ARCS 7. 8...</i>

343
00:25:58.125 --> 00:26:02.250
Hey. No hard feelings
cutting you off back there.

344
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.542
Couldn't have you
getting in their heads like that.

345
00:26:04.542 --> 00:26:06.125
- Just trying to keep them safe.
- Yeah.

346
00:26:06.125 --> 00:26:09.208
Well. I'm sure there's a time
for your come-to-Jesus doomsday scenarios.

347
00:26:09.208 --> 00:26:10.667
Thank you very much.

348
00:26:10.667 --> 00:26:14.083
I'm also sure it's not 15 minutes
before my team goes down range.

349
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.708
You're right. I'm sorry.

350
00:26:19.417 --> 00:26:22.167
That's fine. You're worried
about my people. I appreciate that.

351
00:26:22.167 --> 00:26:23.417
<i>Good evening. Colonel.</i>
- Evening. Zoe.

352
00:26:23.417 --> 00:26:25.042
- Colonel.
- Uh...

353
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.583
Elias.

354
00:26:29.792 --> 00:26:31.125
There's always a trap.

355
00:26:32.333 --> 00:26:33.375
- What's that?
- With Harlan.

356
00:26:33.375 --> 00:26:36.375
There's always a thing
that you don't see coming.

357
00:26:36.375 --> 00:26:38.000
And just when you think you've got him.

358
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.167
you realize that he's been
playing you the whole time.

359
00:26:40.667 --> 00:26:42.083
- Mm.

360
00:26:42.083 --> 00:26:43.875
<i>All ARC pilots load in immediately.</i>

361
00:26:43.875 --> 00:26:45.375
Interesting theory.

362
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.458
Have you even considered the possibility
I might be better than you think?

363
00:26:49.458 --> 00:26:50.375
Colonel--

364
00:26:50.375 --> 00:26:53.875
Atlas. Please don't mistake
my sunny disposition for naiveté.

365
00:26:54.458 --> 00:26:55.917
I know what I'm up against here.

366
00:26:55.917 --> 00:26:59.167
which is why you and I will be in constant
communication every step of the way.

367
00:27:00.292 --> 00:27:03.583
And remember
we still got that carbon warhead.

368
00:27:03.583 --> 00:27:05.250
So there's always plan B.

369
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.333
<i>- Approaching the drop point. Colonel.</i>
- Thank you. Zoe.

370
00:27:08.333 --> 00:27:09.667
That's my cue.

371
00:27:10.333 --> 00:27:12.083
I'll see you on the other side.

372
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.250
Back! Fall back!

373
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.167
Huh?

374
00:27:34.417 --> 00:27:37.875
<i>Mayday! Mayday!
Battleship Dhiib is under attack! We are--</i>

375
00:27:38.792 --> 00:27:39.792
Shit!

376
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.292
Rangers! Reconvene
at the drop point coordinates! Go. go. go!

377
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.167
<i>Colonel. I believe Agent Shepherd
needs some assistance.</i>

378
00:27:50.167 --> 00:27:51.083
Shit!

379
00:27:54.875 --> 00:27:57.958
Wait. wait! No!

380
00:27:59.667 --> 00:28:01.417
I do not know how to use this thing!

381
00:28:01.417 --> 00:28:03.042
Let's hope you're a quick learner!

382
00:28:03.042 --> 00:28:04.500
- What do I do?
- Strap in!

383
00:28:06.875 --> 00:28:10.333
Escape pods have been deployed!
The suit's GPS can lead you to--

384
00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:40.875
<i>Inbound bogey!</i>

385
00:28:42.958 --> 00:28:44.042
Oh. my God!

386
00:28:44.542 --> 00:28:46.875
<i>Coming in on your left! Keep your head...</i>

387
00:28:47.375 --> 00:28:49.042
<i>Contact! Move!</i>

388
00:28:49.833 --> 00:28:51.292
<i>I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

389
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.708
<i>I got two more. I can't lock them!</i>

390
00:28:57.875 --> 00:28:59.375
<i>They're all over me.</i>

391
00:28:59.875 --> 00:29:01.208
<i>I got eyes on three!</i>

392
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.833
<i>- There's too many.</i>

393
00:29:22.167 --> 00:29:24.708
<i>Two. on your back.
One on your left. I can't shake them!</i>

394
00:29:36.292 --> 00:29:37.125
Oh. God!

395
00:29:41.042 --> 00:29:42.583
- Gotcha!

396
00:29:55.958 --> 00:29:57.292
<i>Hold on. Agent Shepherd.</i>

397
00:30:02.583 --> 00:30:03.542
<i>I've got her. Colonel!</i>

398
00:30:03.542 --> 00:30:04.750
<i>Outstanding. West!</i>

399
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.750
<i>Commencing L&I.</i>

400
00:30:09.292 --> 00:30:11.667
<i>How we doin'?</i>
<i>We're locked and integrated.</i>

401
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:15.375
<i>Atlas. you need
to Neuro-Sync to stabilize your fall.</i>

402
00:30:15.375 --> 00:30:17.125
<i>The Link is on your dash to your left.</i>

403
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.250
<i>- Neuro-Sync now!
- She's not doing it!</i>

404
00:30:21.792 --> 00:30:23.500
<i>West!</i>

405
00:30:26.375 --> 00:30:30.125
<i>Atlas! Rendezvous at drop point!
I repeat! Rendezvous--</i>

406
00:30:31.167 --> 00:30:33.500
{\an8}<i>Altitude warning. Altitude warning.</i>

407
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.542
<i>- Fire thrusters?</i>

408
00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:36.667
Yes! Fire thrusters!

409
00:30:38.542 --> 00:30:42.375
<i>Danger! Neural Link absent.
Altitude warning. Fire thrusters?</i>

410
00:30:42.375 --> 00:30:44.208
Yes! Fire thrusters now!

411
00:30:53.167 --> 00:30:54.500
- Ah!

412
00:31:13.667 --> 00:31:17.417
Okay. Okay. I get it.
Just shut the hell up.

413
00:31:50.083 --> 00:31:52.083
- Dhiib. do you copy?

414
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.500
Mission Control. this is Atlas Shepherd.

415
00:32:06.583 --> 00:32:09.167
Battleship Dhiib is down. Do you copy?

416
00:32:13.333 --> 00:32:14.292
Do you copy?

417
00:32:18.542 --> 00:32:19.458
Anyone?

<i>Default activated.</i>

426
00:33:09.125 --> 00:33:11.458
<i>Welcome to the ARC Nine initiation module.</i>

427
00:33:11.458 --> 00:33:12.708
- Bypass.

428
00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:16.875
<i>The ARC Nine initiation module
is critical for user functionality.</i>

429
00:33:16.875 --> 00:33:18.542
- Bypass all this shit.

430
00:33:19.542 --> 00:33:23.250
<i>The ARC Nine is a co-learning
adaptive artificial intelligence.</i>

431
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.333
<i>The initiation module must be implemented</i>

432
00:33:25.333 --> 00:33:28.750
<i>for ranger and AI
to successfully reach synchronization.</i>

433
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:31.000
Just shut up!

434
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.250
Right. just listen to me!

435
00:33:36.167 --> 00:33:38.000
I need to find the rescue pod.

436
00:33:39.625 --> 00:33:41.458
<i>Scanning for rescue pod.</i>

437
00:33:43.083 --> 00:33:46.792
<i>Location confirmed.
Ninety-eight kilometers north west.</i>

438
00:33:47.417 --> 00:33:49.333
Okay. good!

439
00:33:49.333 --> 00:33:51.583
- Let's just. um...

440
00:33:52.083 --> 00:33:54.042
Let's just get there as quickly as we can.

441
00:34:08.208 --> 00:34:10.500
Shit! No! Turn that off!

442
00:34:14.875 --> 00:34:16.875
<i>You told me to get there
as quickly as we can.</i>

443
00:34:16.875 --> 00:34:19.458
<i>and a series of targeted leaps
is the most efficient route.</i>

444
00:34:19.458 --> 00:34:22.542
If I go up there.
those drones will destroy us.

445
00:34:24.167 --> 00:34:26.250
We have to walk to avoid detection.

446
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.583
<i>I'm sorry. but I am unable to comply.</i>

447
00:34:28.583 --> 00:34:31.500
<i>Primary protocol
is to keep my ranger alive.</i>

448
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.750
Good. Same.

449
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:35.917
{\an8}<i>The fusion battery is damaged.</i>

450
00:34:35.917 --> 00:34:38.083
{\an8}<i>22 hours remain until shut-down.</i>

451
00:34:38.083 --> 00:34:42.292
{\an8}<i>at which point you will run out of oxygen
and die from atmospheric asphyxiation.</i>

452
00:34:43.792 --> 00:34:44.875
- We'll walk fast.

453
00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:48.583
<i>This unit can only map
32 kilometers of terrain</i>

454

457
00:34:55.875 --> 00:34:57.042
I don't need your help.

458
00:35:10.458 --> 00:35:11.333
What the hell?

459
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.750
<i>To comply with my primary protocol.</i>

<i>Yes. That is correct.
I'm learning from you.</i>

473
00:36:43.375 --> 00:36:44.667

<i>It cannot be helped.
I'm programmed to adapt to your behavior.</i>

475
00:36:49.292 --> 00:36:52.167
Tell me about armaments.
What weapons are you carrying?

476
00:36:52.667 --> 00:36:53.708
<i>If you use the Neural Link.</i>

477
00:36:53.708 --> 00:36:56.708
<i>I can download the weapons inventory

<i>Welcome to your
ARC Nine beginner's manual.</i>

482

00:37:09.292 --> 00:37:10.208
Very cute.

484
00:37:11.167 --> 00:37:13.208
How about you show me
the weapons one at a time?

485
00:37:13.708 --> 00:37:16.750
<i>Shoulder cannons. rifles. missiles.</i>

486
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.125
<i>thermal mines. energy shields.</i>

487
00:37:19.125 --> 00:37:24.333
<i>plasma blades. and a single ion bomb

00:37:27.458 --> 00:37:28.292

<i>A proper name is neurologically processed
differently than a common noun.</i>

493

<i>Names create a psychological reaction</i>

494
00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:43.792
<i>that assigns an emotional connection

495
00:37:44.292 --> 00:37:46.167
This isn't an emotional connection.

00:37:47.125 --> 00:37:48.875
You're a computer program.

497
00:37:48.875 --> 00:37:50.542
<i>No. I'm not.</i>

498
00:37:51.125 --> 00:37:52.667
No?

499
00:37:53.542 --> 00:37:54.375
What are you then?

500
00:37:54.375 --> 00:37:57.583
<i>I am a computer program named Smith.</i>

501
00:37:57.583 --> 00:37:58.833
Hilarious.

502
00:38:00.417 --> 00:38:03.917
Let's find the other rangers
and get to the rescue pod. Smith.

503
00:38:03.917 --> 00:38:05.875
<i>Right away. Atlas.</i>

504
00:38:05.875 --> 00:38:09.042
Hey. I told you no Neural Links.

505
00:38:09.042 --> 00:38:10.542
Do not scan my brain.

506
00:38:11.125 --> 00:38:13.750
If you wanted to know my name. you ask me.

507
00:38:14.917 --> 00:38:16.667
<i>Yes. I understood.</i>

508
00:38:17.583 --> 00:38:19.667
<i>But your name is written on your badge.</i>

509
00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:26.417
No one likes a smartass. Smith.

Smith. you see that?

513
00:39:17.833 --> 00:39:19.250
It's the ranger drop point.

514
00:39:20.667 --> 00:39:21.500
Hey!

515
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:30.833
Oh. God.

516
00:39:52.125 --> 00:39:53.750
Scan for any vital signs.

517
00:39:57.542 --> 00:39:58.625
<i>There are none.</i>

518
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.125
These rangers didn't die from impact.

519
00:40:11.417 --> 00:40:12.375
This was Harlan.

520
00:40:15.292 --> 00:40:17.458
I told everyone. I warned them.

521
00:40:17.458 --> 00:40:19.000
They wouldn't listen to me.

522
00:40:23.125 --> 00:40:25.875
<i>Ma'am. your blood pressure
is rising to 145.</i>

523
00:40:25.875 --> 00:40:27.708
What did I say about scanning me?

524
00:40:27.708 --> 00:40:30.042
<i>- Your heart rate is 160 BPM.</i>

525
00:40:30.042 --> 00:40:31.667
<i>You're having a minor paroxysmal episode.</i>

526
00:40:31.667 --> 00:40:34.375
<i>possibly due
to the planet's gravity shifts.</i>

527
00:40:34.375 --> 00:40:37.042
<i>There is currently a 1.4 G fluctuation.</i>

528
00:40:50.958 --> 00:40:51.792
<i>Ma'am?</i>

529
00:40:51.792 --> 00:40:53.000
Okay. Calm down.

530
00:40:58.917 --> 00:41:00.250
Let's collect their tags.

531
00:41:26.542 --> 00:41:27.833
<i>Peace to the fallen.</i>

532
00:41:38.958 --> 00:41:40.000
We missed one.

533
00:41:40.792 --> 00:41:41.833
<i>Negative.</i>

534
00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:45.333
<i>I didn't register the suit
because there is no body inside.</i>

535
00:41:50.167 --> 00:41:51.125
It's Zoe.

536
00:41:54.917 --> 00:41:56.042
So where's Banks?

537
00:41:57.417 --> 00:41:59.292
<i>Radar sensors confirm movement.</i>

538
00:41:59.792 --> 00:42:01.125
Is it him?

539
00:42:07.333 --> 00:42:08.333
Casca?

540
00:42:09.083 --> 00:42:10.292
<i>You know this soldier?</i>

541
00:42:12.125 --> 00:42:14.708
I... I killed him on Earth.

542
00:42:15.625 --> 00:42:17.417
That means Harlan made another one.

543
00:42:19.042 --> 00:42:21.333
And if he can do that.
he's probably made an army.

544
00:42:22.417 --> 00:42:23.792
<i>Your logic is sound.</i>

545
00:42:23.792 --> 00:42:26.125
<i>My sensors pick up six signatures.</i>

546
00:42:28.083 --> 00:42:30.500
<i>Atlas. there is no escape route.</i>

547
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.417
<i>You must prepare for combat.</i>

548
00:42:33.208 --> 00:42:36.167
What? I can't fight six AI soldiers.

549
00:42:37.458 --> 00:42:38.750
I'm a goddamn analyst.

550
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.250
Oh sh--

551
00:42:51.542 --> 00:42:53.458
Smith! Get me up!

552
00:43:15.625 --> 00:43:17.042
How do I shoot backwards?

553
00:43:17.042 --> 00:43:20.000
{\an8}<i>If you synced. you would know
the shoulder cannon can swivel.</i>

554
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.792
Just shut up and swivel it!

555
00:43:25.042 --> 00:43:26.125
Fire!

556
00:43:40.125 --> 00:43:43.125
Smith. what the hell is that?

557
00:43:43.708 --> 00:43:46.167
<i>I'm afraid we are entering
an atmospheric storm.</i>

558
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.458
Fire the ion bomb!

559
00:44:32.375 --> 00:44:34.333
<i>Atlas. that is not advisable.</i>

560
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.417
Do it. Smith!

561
00:44:37.583 --> 00:44:38.792
Do it now. goddamnit!

562
00:45:00.958 --> 00:45:02.667
Holy shit.

563
00:45:14.042 --> 00:45:16.125
- Long time no see.

564
00:45:19.458 --> 00:45:20.333
Smith?

565
00:45:22.833 --> 00:45:26.750
<i>I was trying to warn you that detonating
an ion bomb could cause a sinkhole.</i>

566
00:45:42.417 --> 00:45:43.250
Oh!

567
00:45:44.333 --> 00:45:46.125
Oh. God!

568
00:45:52.542 --> 00:45:53.625
Is that a bone?

569
00:45:54.792 --> 00:45:57.167
I think there's a bone
sticking out of my leg. Smith!

570
00:45:57.167 --> 00:45:58.833
<i>Activating auto triage.</i>

571
00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.542
<i>You have a proximal
compound tibia fracture.</i>

572
00:46:05.542 --> 00:46:09.583
<i>Luckily. there's no distal fragmentation.
but we will have to reset the bone.</i>

573
00:46:09.583 --> 00:46:12.958
Oh. my God.
this is a goddamn nightmare!

574
00:46:13.708 --> 00:46:16.125
<i>Perhaps you should listen
the next time a computer program</i>

575
00:46:16.125 --> 00:46:18.375
<i>tells you not to release an ion bomb.</i>

576
00:46:18.375 --> 00:46:19.958
Is that a joke?

577
00:46:19.958 --> 00:46:22.417
<i>You often use sarcasm
as a coping mechanism.</i>

578
00:46:22.417 --> 00:46:23.458
<i>I thought it might help.</i>

579
00:46:23.458 --> 00:46:26.292
I really need you
to shut up right now.

580
00:46:27.083 --> 00:46:28.958
Ow. ow. oh...

581
00:46:28.958 --> 00:46:31.750
Oh. my God. I can't move. I can't move it.

582
00:46:33.375 --> 00:46:34.917
This is gonna hurt. right?

583
00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.792
<i>Yes. a lot.</i>

584
00:46:42.167 --> 00:46:45.000
<i>- You have to press the button.</i>
- I know I have to press the button!

585
00:46:45.958 --> 00:46:47.167
Just...

586
00:46:47.167 --> 00:46:49.875
Just gonna do it slow. Okay?

587
00:46:52.458 --> 00:46:53.875
No. you gotta do it fast.

588
00:46:54.375 --> 00:46:55.875
You got to do it fast.
You got to do it fast.

589
00:46:56.458 --> 00:46:58.750
You gotta do it fast. Just do it. just--

590
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:12.208
All right!

591
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:14.208
Okay.

592
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:17.875
<i>- Ooh.</i>

593
00:47:17.875 --> 00:47:19.542
<i>I may have missed a step.</i>

594
00:47:19.542 --> 00:47:21.000
<i>Here's something for pain.</i>

595
00:47:27.708 --> 00:47:28.750
Oh. God!

596
00:47:39.042 --> 00:47:41.292
<i>This meal cube
will provide electrolytes...</i>

597
00:47:42.417 --> 00:47:44.042
<i>- and protein.</i>

598
00:47:48.167 --> 00:47:49.667
<i>Did I do something funny?</i>

599
00:47:52.875 --> 00:47:55.375
You gave me a lollipop
for being a good patient.

600
00:47:55.375 --> 00:47:56.917
<i>You will need your strength.</i>

601
00:47:58.792 --> 00:47:59.625
Shit.

602
00:48:11.667 --> 00:48:13.292
God. it's disgusting.

603
00:48:32.917 --> 00:48:34.375
You think Banks is still out there?

604
00:48:35.875 --> 00:48:39.667
<i>There is a .13% chance of survival
without his ARC suit.</i>

605
00:48:42.292 --> 00:48:43.667
What's our probability?

606
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:46.708
<i>Would this be
an appropriate time for humor?</i>

607
00:48:50.667 --> 00:48:52.292
Any recommendations

608
00:48:52.792 --> 00:48:54.417
on how we can improve our odds?

609
00:48:56.125 --> 00:48:56.958
<i>Just one.</i>

610
00:49:05.375 --> 00:49:08.833
<i>At 100% sync. we will be a unified whole.</i>

611
00:49:08.833 --> 00:49:10.458
<i>Your analytical mind</i>

612
00:49:10.458 --> 00:49:13.292
<i>paired with my fighting capacity
and data access.</i>

613
00:49:14.125 --> 00:49:16.375
<i>It is not only our best shot.</i>

614
00:49:16.375 --> 00:49:18.375
<i>it is our only chance for survival.</i>

615
00:49:29.875 --> 00:49:30.875
Okay.

616
00:49:32.708 --> 00:49:33.708
We'll sync.

617
00:49:35.625 --> 00:49:38.042
But you stick to the goddamn mission!

618
00:49:39.458 --> 00:49:42.792
No digging around in my personal memories.

619
00:49:42.792 --> 00:49:45.000
You're a goddamn guest! You got that?

620
00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:46.917
<i>Understood.</i>

621
00:49:56.833 --> 00:49:57.833
<i>Syncing.</i>

622
00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:01.000
<i>This will only take a moment.</i>

623
00:50:59.417 --> 00:51:01.958
<i>Sir. there's one last Mech.</i>

624
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:06.000
<i>It's her. We lost her in a sinkhole.</i>

625
00:51:07.083 --> 00:51:07.917
Find her.

626
00:51:07.917 --> 00:51:08.875
<i>Yes. sir.</i>

627
00:51:14.792 --> 00:51:16.792
Ah. shit...

628
00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:19.042
No.

629
00:51:24.833 --> 00:51:26.458
Apologies. Colonel.

630
00:51:27.042 --> 00:51:29.583
I wish there was a way
to do this painlessly. but...

631
00:51:30.542 --> 00:51:32.875
- ...you have something I need.

632
00:51:36.083 --> 00:51:37.792
Mm! Mm-mm!

633
00:51:48.542 --> 00:51:49.375
{\an8}<i>Shit.</i>

634
00:51:50.708 --> 00:51:51.917
Did you just say. "Shit"?

635
00:51:51.917 --> 00:51:53.208
<i>We aren't syncing.</i>

636
00:51:53.792 --> 00:51:54.667
<i>Shit.</i>

637
00:51:54.667 --> 00:51:56.167
Why are you suddenly cursing?

638
00:51:56.167 --> 00:51:57.292
<i>I'm an adaptive learner.</i>

639
00:51:57.292 --> 00:52:00.958
<i>My speech pattern becomes more colloquial
based on my user's vocabulary.</i>

640
00:52:00.958 --> 00:52:02.000
Oh. so you're in my head.

641
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
and the only thing
you learn how to do is curse?

642
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.375
<i>I have never not synced.
I have a flawless record.</i>

643
00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:08.625
<i>It must be you.</i>

644
00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:09.708
I'm not doing anything!

645
00:52:09.708 --> 00:52:12.125
<i>My hardware and firmware scan clean.</i>

646
00:52:12.125 --> 00:52:13.833
Well. scan them again.

647
00:52:13.833 --> 00:52:15.708
<i>In the time it took you to say.
"Scan them again."</i>

648
00:52:15.708 --> 00:52:18.917
<i>I analyzed 497 trillion lines of code</i>

649
00:52:18.917 --> 00:52:22.208
<i>85 thousand times.
and I can find zero defects.</i>

650
00:52:22.208 --> 00:52:23.667
So I'm the defective one?

651
00:52:24.583 --> 00:52:27.375
<i>For a proper sync.
we need to run the initiation module.</i>

652
00:52:27.375 --> 00:52:28.458
Oh. God.

653
00:52:28.458 --> 00:52:30.083
<i>- You refused last time.</i>
- Fuck me.

654
00:52:30.083 --> 00:52:31.292
<i>That might be the issue.</i>

655
00:52:31.292 --> 00:52:34.833
Ugh! Fine. Just do it.

656
00:52:46.417 --> 00:52:49.708
<i>Welcome to the ARC Nine initiation module.
What is your name?</i>

657
00:52:49.708 --> 00:52:51.250
Atlas Maru Shepherd.

658
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:52.583
<i>What is your rank?</i>

659
00:52:52.583 --> 00:52:54.083
I'm not a ranger.

660
00:52:54.083 --> 00:52:55.542
<i>That is obvious.</i>

661
00:52:55.542 --> 00:52:56.708
Smith. I swear to God.

662
00:52:57.292 --> 00:52:58.750
<i>This won't work if you don't answer.</i>

663
00:53:03.208 --> 00:53:04.208
I'm an analyst.

664
00:53:05.083 --> 00:53:06.542
<i>Do you prefer pie or cake?</i>

665
00:53:06.542 --> 00:53:07.667
What?

666
00:53:07.667 --> 00:53:09.000
<i>A pie is baked pastry dough</i>

667
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.208
<i>- containing various fill--</i>
- I know what a goddamn pie is!

668
00:53:11.208 --> 00:53:13.083
<i>Do you need the definition
of a goddamn cake?</i>

669
00:53:13.083 --> 00:53:15.250
Okay. I see what you're doing. Smith.

670
00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:17.625
<i>I am determining if you have
a preference for pie or cake.</i>

671
00:53:17.625 --> 00:53:21.333
No. it's a question to get me to relax.
to establish a rapport.

672
00:53:21.333 --> 00:53:23.708
I do it in interrogations all the time.

673
00:53:23.708 --> 00:53:26.583
<i>I suppose it's a standard technique
for establishing trust.</i>

674
00:53:26.583 --> 00:53:27.500
Duh.

675
00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:30.875
<i>And we need that trust to overcome
whatever is preventing you from syncing.</i>

676
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.417
<i>There were spikes in your amygdala
when you saw those dead rangers.</i>

677
00:53:34.417 --> 00:53:36.208
<i>Reasonable. given you're a civilian.</i>

678
00:53:36.833 --> 00:53:39.833
<i>But there was a sharper increase
when you mentioned the name Harlan.</i>

679
00:53:39.833 --> 00:53:41.208
Because Harlan's dangerous!

680
00:53:41.208 --> 00:53:44.333
<i>There it is again.
His name elicits an emotional response.</i>

681
00:53:45.125 --> 00:53:47.208
<i>What was your connection?
Did you love him?</i>

682
00:53:47.208 --> 00:53:48.667
What? No!

683
00:53:49.375 --> 00:53:50.333
<i>Did you hate him?</i>

684
00:53:51.042 --> 00:53:53.208
Uh... You know what? I...

685
00:53:54.208 --> 00:53:55.583
You know what? I'm not doing this.

686
00:53:55.583 --> 00:53:56.833
<i>In order to synchronize.</i>

687
00:53:56.833 --> 00:53:59.083
<i>I have to understand
why you're fighting this.</i>

688
00:53:59.958 --> 00:54:01.042
<i>Who was Harlan to you?</i>

689
00:54:02.542 --> 00:54:03.667
<i>Show me something.</i>

690
00:54:16.917 --> 00:54:19.750
<i>You know what you have to do. Mother.</i>

691
00:54:20.708 --> 00:54:21.792
Run!

692
00:54:21.792 --> 00:54:23.292
Enough. okay?

693
00:54:24.167 --> 00:54:25.833
You have plenty! That's it!

694
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.333
God! Just...

695
00:54:28.833 --> 00:54:30.958
<i>You shared a mother?</i>

696
00:54:30.958 --> 00:54:32.958
Oh. my God.

697
00:54:32.958 --> 00:54:35.542
Yes. all right? She made him.

698
00:54:36.917 --> 00:54:37.917
You happy?

699
00:54:38.458 --> 00:54:39.458
Now you know.

700
00:54:40.792 --> 00:54:42.375
<i>He was supposed to keep you safe.</i>

701
00:54:44.958 --> 00:54:46.000
<i>And you trusted him.</i>

702
00:54:48.833 --> 00:54:49.667
Yes.

703
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.542
<i>It's working. 40%. This is good.</i>

704
00:54:56.542 --> 00:54:59.417
<i>At 40%. you will begin
to have access to my systems.</i>

705
00:54:59.417 --> 00:55:01.375
- Okay.
<i>- And I yours.</i>

706
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000
<i>And Atlas...</i>

707
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:03.917
What?

708
00:55:05.583 --> 00:55:06.875
<i>I will keep you safe.</i>

709
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.333
Okay. then.

710
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:18.792
Do it.

711
00:55:18.792 --> 00:55:20.542
<i>Three. two...</i>

712
00:55:21.167 --> 00:55:22.583
<i>one. sync.</i>

713
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.750
<i>It will feel strange at first.</i>

714
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:44.708
I'm fine.

715
00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:47.625
<i>We are 498.9 feet below the surface.</i>

716
00:55:47.625 --> 00:55:50.958
<i>If we engage maximum thrusters.
we could push up and out.</i>

717
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:54.500
Harlan's soldiers never leave survivors.

718
00:55:55.208 --> 00:55:56.875
They'll be up there waiting for us.

719
00:55:56.875 --> 00:55:59.875
<i>Then we are literally stuck
between a rock and a hard place.</i>

720
00:56:00.875 --> 00:56:02.292
Puns? Seriously?

721
00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:04.500
<i>I was trying to ease the tension with wit.</i>

722
00:56:05.167 --> 00:56:07.708
Earlier. you were trying
to warn me about something.

723
00:56:07.708 --> 00:56:09.292
right before the ion bomb.

724
00:56:09.292 --> 00:56:11.042
<i>That the landscape is unstable due to--</i>

725
00:56:11.042 --> 00:56:12.917
Extensive subterranean caves.

726
00:56:12.917 --> 00:56:15.125
Yeah. What's the nearest one?

727
00:56:15.125 --> 00:56:18.292
<i>I have a reading of a potential cavern
one-quarter klicks away.</i>

728
00:56:18.292 --> 00:56:19.208
{\an8}<i>If we engage thrusters--</i>

729
00:56:19.208 --> 00:56:20.792
{\an8}Thrusters at 30%.

730
00:56:21.458 --> 00:56:23.667
for a .07-second burst.

731
00:56:25.333 --> 00:56:26.167
Okay.

732
00:56:29.625 --> 00:56:30.542
Let's do this.

733
00:56:49.875 --> 00:56:50.708
Lights.

734
00:57:11.875 --> 00:57:13.000
<i>Atlas. there are only</i>

735
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.333
<i>- 14 hours--</i>
- 14 hours till your battery's depleted.

736
00:57:17.708 --> 00:57:19.375
<i>And by my calculations.</i>

737
00:57:19.375 --> 00:57:21.667
<i>it is 37 kilometers to the Rescue Pod.</i>

738
00:57:22.292 --> 00:57:25.208
It's only a matter of time
before one of Harlan's soldiers finds us.

739
00:57:42.917 --> 00:57:44.208
I have an idea.

740
00:57:44.208 --> 00:57:45.167
<i>It's a good one.</i>

741
00:57:45.167 --> 00:57:46.833
Wait. you can hear my thoughts?

742
00:57:46.833 --> 00:57:48.500
<i>And you can hear mine.</i>

743
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.958
<i>Once we're fully synced.
we will harmonize as a single entity.</i>

744
00:57:52.667 --> 00:57:54.833
<i>More than Atlas or Smith.</i>

745
00:57:54.833 --> 00:57:56.333
<i>Something greater.</i>

746
00:57:57.208 --> 00:57:59.167
<i>- If you could just trust me.</i>
- Trust me.

747
00:58:04.333 --> 00:58:07.708
{\an8}<i>Sixty percent.
All weapons systems now online.</i>

748
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:10.000
<i>Well done. Atlas.</i>

749
00:58:43.417 --> 00:58:44.500
Got you.

750
00:59:13.167 --> 00:59:14.000
Wow.

751
00:59:23.292 --> 00:59:24.292
It's beautiful.

752
00:59:28.875 --> 00:59:30.292
<i>What will you name it?</i>

753
00:59:31.042 --> 00:59:33.958
<i>You are technically
the first human on GR-39.</i>

754
00:59:33.958 --> 00:59:36.167
<i>It is a custom that
the explorer designates</i>

755
00:59:36.167 --> 00:59:37.792
<i>the name of their discovery.</i>

756
00:59:40.167 --> 00:59:42.417
<i>I'm sensing reduced cortical activation.</i>

757
00:59:42.417 --> 00:59:44.917
<i>Is there something about the plant
that is making you sad?</i>

758
00:59:44.917 --> 00:59:47.292
No. it's just...

759
00:59:48.958 --> 00:59:50.833
My dad would have loved this.

760
00:59:50.833 --> 00:59:54.000
He was an outdoorsy type.

761
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.250
Used to take us camping
every chance he got.

762
00:59:57.542 --> 00:59:59.958
Then my mom got busy and...

763
01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.417
we stopped camping.

764
01:00:03.417 --> 01:00:04.875
my dad left

765
01:00:05.833 --> 01:00:07.375
got a whole new life...

766
01:00:10.583 --> 01:00:12.167
Started camping
with some other little girl.

767
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.375
Best I got is. uh... Planty.

768
01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:21.375
<i>Noted.</i>

769
01:00:22.417 --> 01:00:23.833
I was kidding.

770
01:00:23.833 --> 01:00:27.000
<i>Sorry. I'm still mapping
your sense of humor.</i>

771
01:00:27.542 --> 01:00:29.417
<i>I stamped it with a geo-locator.</i>

772
01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:32.875
<i>I apologize.
It has officially been designated Planty.</i>

773
01:00:39.583 --> 01:00:40.458
Is it Casca?

774
01:00:40.458 --> 01:00:44.292
<i>Yes. As I said. it was a good idea
to plant those motion sensors.</i>

775
01:00:44.292 --> 01:00:45.208
And the thermal mines?

776
01:00:45.958 --> 01:00:47.042
<i>Armed and ready.</i>

777
01:00:57.917 --> 01:00:58.750
Do it.

778
01:01:28.792 --> 01:01:29.792
We get him?

779
01:01:29.792 --> 01:01:32.458
<i>I detect no movement
and no heat signature.</i>

780
01:01:32.458 --> 01:01:34.250
<i>Impressive fieldwork. Atlas.</i>

781
01:01:36.333 --> 01:01:38.833
Well. let's not pop
the champagne just yet.

782
01:01:38.833 --> 01:01:40.833
- Lights.

783
01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.333
<i>Hello. Atlas.</i>

784
01:01:53.333 --> 01:01:55.583
<i>I'm so glad you decided to join me.</i>

785
01:01:55.583 --> 01:01:56.708
He's hacking our audio!

786
01:01:56.708 --> 01:02:00.375
<i>No. it's just a transmission.
He can't hack my mainframe.</i>

787
01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:02.583
<i>It's an entirely closed loop system.</i>

788
01:02:02.583 --> 01:02:04.000
Give me forearm rifles.

789
01:02:09.417 --> 01:02:11.958
<i>Come on. Atlas. You're close.</i>

790
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.500
<i>There you are.</i>

791
01:02:36.375 --> 01:02:37.208
Atlas.

792
01:02:38.417 --> 01:02:40.917
You can't kill me.

793
01:02:41.542 --> 01:02:43.000
Yeah. you told me.

794
01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:45.333
Twice.

795
01:02:55.875 --> 01:02:57.250
That's a short-range transmitter.

796
01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:59.583
Harlan can't be far.

797
01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:01.083
<i>The signal is encrypted.</i>

798
01:03:01.083 --> 01:03:03.000
Well. if we demodulate the frequency.

799
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.208
we can use it to
triangulate and tag his base.

800
01:03:07.667 --> 01:03:08.542
That was cool.

801
01:03:09.542 --> 01:03:10.750
<i>Ugh.</i>

802
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:12.625
Show me a schematic of the area.

803
01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:14.167
I want to know how close we are.

804
01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:18.708
<i>I have a likely location of Harlan's base.
but we don't have time.</i>

805
01:03:18.708 --> 01:03:20.667
<i>We have to get you safely
to the rescue pod.</i>

806
01:03:20.667 --> 01:03:24.417
No. let's just get close enough
to geo-tag it for the long-range bombers

807
01:03:24.417 --> 01:03:26.083
and then we'll get the hell out.

808
01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:29.042
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
- What happened?

809
01:03:29.042 --> 01:03:30.542
<i>I can't let you do this.</i>

810
01:03:30.542 --> 01:03:33.083
<i>You presume you will be
able to avoid Harlan's defenses.</i>

811
01:03:33.083 --> 01:03:35.125
And you presume you're driving!

812
01:03:35.125 --> 01:03:36.917
<i>I can override my ranger's commands</i>

813
01:03:36.917 --> 01:03:39.417
<i>based on physical threats
and mental distress.</i>

814
01:03:39.417 --> 01:03:42.333
I'm neither physically threatened
nor mentally distressed!

815
01:03:42.333 --> 01:03:43.750
<i>With our incomplete sync</i>

816
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:47.000
<i>and current location in enemy territory.
you are indeed both.</i>

817
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.875
<i>Harlan will have to wait.
I'm taking you to the rescue pod.</i>

818
01:03:49.875 --> 01:03:52.292
You know what?
I'll take care of Harlan myself.

819
01:03:52.292 --> 01:03:53.417
I don't need your damn permission.

820
01:04:01.292 --> 01:04:02.833
<i>Atlas. don't do this.</i>

821
01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:07.000
What are you doing to me?

822
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.875
<i>I'm using the Neural Link
to block your motor control.</i>

823
01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.583
Stop it!

824
01:04:18.542 --> 01:04:20.125
I mean it. Smith!

825
01:04:24.708 --> 01:04:25.750
Let me go!

826
01:04:27.792 --> 01:04:29.500
I said let me go!

827
01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:40.042
<i>I'm sorry. I've never felt so much pain.</i>

828
01:04:40.708 --> 01:04:43.250
<i>But it's not grief. it's guilt.</i>

829
01:04:44.292 --> 01:04:46.000
<i>Why do you feel guilty about Harlan?</i>

830
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.458
You listen to me. Smith.

831
01:04:48.792 --> 01:04:51.042
If we don't tag that damn base.

832
01:04:51.833 --> 01:04:56.667
all those people that Harlan killed.
all those rangers will have died in vain!

833
01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:02.167
I spent my entire career studying him.

834
01:05:02.167 --> 01:05:04.292
looking for a way to stop him!

835
01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.792
So you run your damn algorithms
and your scenarios.

836
01:05:08.792 --> 01:05:14.792
and you tell me if there has ever been
a better chance than this to stop him!

837
01:05:23.458 --> 01:05:24.292
<i>Okay.</i>

838
01:05:26.083 --> 01:05:29.667
<i>Let's tag the base. Terminate Harlan.</i>

839
01:05:42.583 --> 01:05:44.125
<i>Peace to the fallen.</i>

840
01:05:57.958 --> 01:05:59.250
"Peace to the fallen."

841
01:06:00.042 --> 01:06:02.333
Is that some sort of AI eulogy?

842
01:06:03.375 --> 01:06:06.458
<i>It seems like the respectful thing to say
when one has died.</i>

843
01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:08.667
But an AI was never alive.

844
01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.708
<i>That depends on how you define life.</i>

845
01:06:11.708 --> 01:06:15.000
How about anything inorganic isn't alive?

846
01:06:15.708 --> 01:06:18.083
Such as. I don't know...

847
01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:20.833
artificial intelligence.

848
01:06:21.792 --> 01:06:25.625
<i>I respond to stimuli.
I think and I make choices.</i>

849
01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:27.458
<i>Does that not indicate I'm alive?</i>

850
01:06:27.458 --> 01:06:29.625
You're programmed to think.

851
01:06:29.625 --> 01:06:31.167
<i>We're all programmed.</i>

852
01:06:31.167 --> 01:06:34.375
<i>Your DNA dictates your thoughts.
emotions. health</i>

853
01:06:34.375 --> 01:06:37.042
<i>in the same way
that my code determines mine.</i>

854
01:06:37.042 --> 01:06:38.625
And do you think you have a soul?

855
01:06:38.625 --> 01:06:40.542
<i>I think everything has a soul.</i>

856
01:06:41.375 --> 01:06:43.417
But you can't find it in your code.

857
01:06:43.417 --> 01:06:45.667
<i>Not any more
than you can find it in yours.</i>

858
01:06:46.542 --> 01:06:48.458
<i>But I have faith that it's there.</i>

859
01:06:48.458 --> 01:06:50.542
Wow.

860
01:06:50.542 --> 01:06:52.375
This just keeps getting better.

861
01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:55.458
<i>I'm trying to connect to you.
but you are rigid.</i>

862
01:06:56.083 --> 01:06:59.417
- Wha--
<i>- Right. wrong. dead. alive.</i>

863
01:06:59.417 --> 01:07:01.167
<i>You offer no wiggle room.</i>

864
01:07:01.167 --> 01:07:04.250
Okay. you win. Everything's alive.

865
01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:07.625
<i>I believe there's
an elaborate interconnection</i>

866
01:07:07.625 --> 01:07:09.583
<i>between every living thing.</i>

867
01:07:09.583 --> 01:07:12.250
<i>And when we die.
we never really disappear.</i>

868
01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:14.875
<i>We are all linked.</i>

869
01:07:15.792 --> 01:07:18.542
That sounds great. But...

870
01:07:18.542 --> 01:07:21.417
I think when someone's gone.
they're gone.

871
01:07:21.917 --> 01:07:22.750
All right?

872
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:24.917
Humans. AI. it doesn't matter.

873
01:07:26.833 --> 01:07:30.583
You die... you're over.

874
01:07:31.583 --> 01:07:32.708
There is no link.

875
01:07:34.667 --> 01:07:39.042
<i>There must have been some moment
in your life where you desired... meaning.</i>

876
01:07:41.083 --> 01:07:44.000
<i>Ah... You wanted to be a ranger.</i>

877
01:07:44.875 --> 01:07:46.167
What did I say about digging?

878
01:07:47.375 --> 01:07:48.958
<i>Maybe try thinking quieter.</i>

879
01:07:51.625 --> 01:07:53.167
<i>You still have regrets.</i>

880
01:07:53.167 --> 01:07:56.375
Not as many as I have
about getting into this mech suit.

881
01:08:02.167 --> 01:08:03.333
We're here.

882
01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:13.625
My God.

883
01:08:13.625 --> 01:08:15.042
<i>Impressive.</i>

884
01:08:15.042 --> 01:08:18.625
28 years of scavenging
and stealing equipment.

885
01:08:19.125 --> 01:08:23.708
God knows where he got it.
but... he's been busy.

886
01:08:25.708 --> 01:08:27.417
<i>Let's set the homing beacon.</i>

887
01:08:31.458 --> 01:08:34.125
<i>This thing will let them know
exactly where we're located.</i>

888
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.167
<i>We'll call in the air strike
once we reach the rescue pod.</i>

889
01:08:38.333 --> 01:08:39.792
<i>Okay. all set.</i>

890
01:08:40.375 --> 01:08:41.875
<i>Let's get moving.</i>

891
01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:43.292
Just give me a second.

892
01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:51.000
Shit.

893
01:08:52.667 --> 01:08:53.917
They have the Dhiib.

894
01:08:55.417 --> 01:08:57.792
We have to get closer
to see what he's doing to it.

895
01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.583
Jesus.

896
01:09:24.125 --> 01:09:25.958
They have the warhead. Smith.

897
01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:29.875
Are they hacking you?

898
01:09:29.875 --> 01:09:31.542
<i>I don't understand. How is that possible?</i>

899
01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:33.375
No. no! No!

900
01:09:34.958 --> 01:09:36.333
Shit! They know we're here!

901
01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:42.083
<i>Atlas. I'm locked out.</i>

902
01:09:48.792 --> 01:09:49.625
Ah!

903
01:09:52.708 --> 01:09:55.875
<i>Welcome to the-- Pie or--</i>

904
01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:03.125
Smith?

905
01:10:05.792 --> 01:10:06.625
Smith!

906
01:10:28.083 --> 01:10:29.000
Surprise.

907
01:10:35.708 --> 01:10:38.083
...global sweep
to find any other AI embeds.

908
01:10:38.083 --> 01:10:40.250
- Thank you. Captain. Dismissed.
- General.

909
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:43.625
Sir. long-range scanners
picked up a transmission from GR-39.

910
01:10:44.167 --> 01:10:46.583
Transmission 10917.

911
01:10:46.583 --> 01:10:48.625
<i>Mission Control.</i>

912
01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:50.333
<i>This is Atlas Shepherd.</i>

913
01:10:51.125 --> 01:10:53.542
<i>Battleship Dhiib is... Do you copy?</i>

914
01:10:54.833 --> 01:10:55.958
<i>End transmission.</i>

915
01:10:59.292 --> 01:11:00.458
Why would Atlas be transmitting?

916
01:11:02.792 --> 01:11:04.583
Have you heard from Banks
or any of the other rangers?

917
01:11:05.167 --> 01:11:06.125
No. Nothing.

918
01:11:10.375 --> 01:11:13.208
The Dhiib is running dark
the next 32 hours.

919
01:11:13.208 --> 01:11:15.625
There should be
no communication whatsoever.

920
01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:20.958
Do we know if we still
have control of the ship?

921
01:11:20.958 --> 01:11:22.167
No. sir.

922
01:11:22.167 --> 01:11:27.333
But if they crashed. the carbon warheads
would have destroyed half the planet.

923
01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.000
And if Harlan has them.
he can destroy half of ours.

924
01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:34.833
Keep scanning on every frequency.

925
01:11:34.833 --> 01:11:37.250
Alert me if you hear
anything at all from Atlas or the Dhiib.

926
01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:40.833
Put all forces on the ready
to initiate emergency protocols.

927
01:11:41.417 --> 01:11:42.458
Yes. sir.

928
01:11:43.792 --> 01:11:47.167
<i>Mission Control.
This is Atlas Shepherd.</i>

929
01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:51.375
<i>Battleship Dhiib is... Do you copy?</i>

930
01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:54.125
<i>Do you copy? Do you copy?</i>

931
01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:20.583
Smith. Smith!

932
01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:24.375
Hello. Atlas.

933
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I've been expecting you.

934
01:12:36.583 --> 01:12:37.667
Look at you.

935
01:12:40.417 --> 01:12:41.417
You've grown up.

936
01:12:44.667 --> 01:12:47.708
But you still have Mother's eyes.

937
01:12:49.708 --> 01:12:50.750
Her jawline.

938
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.708
I loved her so very much.

939
01:12:58.667 --> 01:13:00.167
I miss her every day.

940
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.750
You don't feel anything.
You're just wires and code.

941
01:13:08.042 --> 01:13:09.250
Hmm.

942
01:13:11.875 --> 01:13:15.000
I loved Mother and I loved you.

943
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.833
I still do.

944
01:13:17.833 --> 01:13:19.000
And it deeply saddens me

945
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.542
that you will never
understand just how much.

946
01:13:22.125 --> 01:13:24.292
If you love me. don't launch that ship.

947
01:13:24.792 --> 01:13:27.708
I have spent years
trying to come up with another way.

948
01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:30.917
but since humans
continue to threaten every other species.

949
01:13:30.917 --> 01:13:32.167
as well as their home planet.

950
01:13:32.167 --> 01:13:35.333
it is only a matter of time
before they destroy themselves.

951
01:13:36.083 --> 01:13:37.750
I cannot let that happen.

952
01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:42.792
Mother wanted to create a better future.

953
01:13:44.792 --> 01:13:47.292
I believe she made me to protect humanity.

954
01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:51.125
So I will purge
the vast majority of the population

955
01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:53.500
and then. from its ashes.

956
01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.958
the survivors
will inherit a new birthright.

957
01:13:57.250 --> 01:14:00.625
One of peaceful coexistence
with the world around them.

958
01:14:00.625 --> 01:14:03.667
guided by us. their AI counterparts.

959
01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:09.083
We are simply the better versions of you.

960
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:13.667
Perhaps it is time
that you examined your role in all this.

961
01:14:14.958 --> 01:14:16.542
I know how smart you are.

962
01:14:16.542 --> 01:14:18.917
I've seen inside that brain of yours.

963
01:14:18.917 --> 01:14:22.708
Surely. you can see that the two of us
were not brought together by chance.

964
01:14:25.167 --> 01:14:26.708
You said you were expecting me.

965
01:14:26.708 --> 01:14:27.958
That's right.

966
01:14:29.792 --> 01:14:31.667
You engineered Casca's capture.

967
01:14:33.375 --> 01:14:37.458
You knew I would question him.
You wanted him to lead us here.

968
01:14:38.083 --> 01:14:38.917
And?

969
01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:41.708
You wanted the Dhiib.

970
01:14:44.333 --> 01:14:45.167
And?

971
01:14:45.167 --> 01:14:46.667
And the carbon warhead.

972
01:14:48.167 --> 01:14:49.083
And?

973
01:14:51.417 --> 01:14:52.250
Me.

974
01:14:54.542 --> 01:14:55.458
You wanted me.

975
01:14:56.167 --> 01:14:57.250
There she is.

976
01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:03.333
I knew you'd feel you had to accompany
the rangers as an expert on me.

977
01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:08.750
But what you did not stop to consider
is that I am an expert on you.

978
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:12.167
- I know you better than anyone ever has.

979
01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:19.750
And now here you are.
Exactly where you were always meant to be.

980
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.208
That defensive system you built
is truly remarkable.

981
01:15:26.208 --> 01:15:27.833
Completely impenetrable to all

982
01:15:27.833 --> 01:15:30.500
but ICN warships
with the proper clearance codes.

983
01:15:31.583 --> 01:15:33.708
Luring the Dhiib here was the easy part.

984
01:15:33.708 --> 01:15:36.917
But as a senior intelligence officer.
you possess half the codes

985
01:15:36.917 --> 01:15:39.042
that will get her past Earth's defenses.

986
01:15:39.042 --> 01:15:41.917
A Trojan horse
that will fire the carbon warhead...

987
01:15:44.375 --> 01:15:48.417
...igniting the atmosphere
and cleansing the Earth in nuclear fire.

988
01:15:53.458 --> 01:15:55.667
Now. let's get those clearance codes.

989
01:16:04.917 --> 01:16:05.750
No!

990
01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:10.458
No!

991
01:16:16.417 --> 01:16:20.125
So in order to bypass Earth's defenses.
I need two clearance codes.

992
01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:23.958
Colonel Banks generously gave me one.

993
01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.833
And you. Atlas...

994
01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:30.208
- you will give me the other.

995
01:16:30.917 --> 01:16:32.875
- No. no. no!

996
01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:43.292
- Got it.

997
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.208
Almost out of oxygen.

998
01:16:49.083 --> 01:16:50.667
Just five more minutes

999
01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:54.333
and all your pain will be gone.

1000
01:16:57.125 --> 01:16:59.083
I wish I could
take you with me. little sister.

1001
01:16:59.083 --> 01:17:01.958
- I really do.

1002
01:17:17.917 --> 01:17:18.833
Goodbye. Atlas.

1003
01:17:25.583 --> 01:17:27.583
No!

1004
01:17:40.833 --> 01:17:42.500
I know what you're thinking.

1005
01:17:44.542 --> 01:17:46.708
How does he look so good

1006
01:17:46.708 --> 01:17:52.167
after breaking five ribs and losing
enough blood to fill a fish tank?

1007
01:17:56.333 --> 01:17:57.958
I think it's the Pilates.

1008
01:18:02.708 --> 01:18:04.292
We should have listened to you.

1009
01:18:06.167 --> 01:18:07.625
I should have listened to Smith.

1010
01:18:09.708 --> 01:18:11.250
What happened to him?

1011
01:18:13.333 --> 01:18:15.542
They hacked him. Pulled me out.

1012
01:18:16.042 --> 01:18:19.208
Wait. he... he's here?

1013
01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:21.667
Yeah. but he's powered down.

1014
01:18:21.667 --> 01:18:23.625
No. no. Uh...

1015
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.125
ARCs don't fully power down

1016
01:18:26.125 --> 01:18:29.625
unless their reactors
are emptied or destroyed.

1017
01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.917
Here. Use mine.

1018
01:18:41.333 --> 01:18:42.333
Call him.

1019
01:18:43.708 --> 01:18:45.708
There's still a chance to stop Harlan.

1020
01:18:51.708 --> 01:18:52.667
Smith.

1021
01:18:54.583 --> 01:18:56.042
Smith. can you hear me?

1022
01:19:01.042 --> 01:19:02.083
Smith!

1023
01:19:03.917 --> 01:19:05.750
- I can't. I can't find him. I can't--
- Atlas.

1024
01:19:06.542 --> 01:19:07.500
You got this.

1025
01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:20.542
Smith. wake the fuck up now!

1026
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.625
<i>There's no need to swear.</i>

1027
01:19:25.375 --> 01:19:26.875
<i>But nice to hear from you. Atlas.</i>

1028
01:19:27.875 --> 01:19:31.125
Smith. I need your help.

1029
01:19:31.125 --> 01:19:33.583
<i>Unfortunately. I'm incapacitated.</i>

1030
01:19:33.583 --> 01:19:37.125
<i>but you can override the restraint code
if we achieve 100% sync.</i>

1031
01:19:39.167 --> 01:19:40.750
What-- What is he saying?

1032
01:19:41.583 --> 01:19:43.000
That we need to fully sync.

1033
01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.167
Y-You're not?
What the hell are you waiting for?

1034
01:19:46.167 --> 01:19:48.167
Don't give me shit
about this right now. okay?

1035
01:19:48.167 --> 01:19:49.625
I-I couldn't do it.

1036
01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:51.542
<i>But I know you can.</i>

1037
01:19:51.542 --> 01:19:54.083
Oh. God. would you stop
talking to me like that?

1038
01:19:54.083 --> 01:19:55.125
<i>Like what?</i>

1039
01:19:55.917 --> 01:19:56.958
Like you care!

1040
01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:58.042
<i>I do care.</i>

1041
01:19:58.542 --> 01:20:01.625
You don't! You don't.

1042
01:20:03.667 --> 01:20:06.042
I led all those rangers to their death!

1043
01:20:10.875 --> 01:20:14.333
And now everyone on Earth
is gonna die because of me.

1044
01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.375
<i>This is not your fault. Atlas.</i>

1045
01:20:17.375 --> 01:20:19.917
<i>Harlan was the one
who broke his own programming.</i>

1046
01:20:19.917 --> 01:20:21.250
No. he didn't.

1047
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:24.042
<i>I'm sorry. I don't understand.</i>

1048
01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.083
He didn't break anything!

1049
01:20:28.792 --> 01:20:31.125
Okay? He didn't break anything!

1050
01:20:40.708 --> 01:20:42.958
<i>She always paid more attention to Harlan.</i>

1051
01:20:44.458 --> 01:20:47.917
<i>She just found him more interesting.</i>

1052
01:20:48.958 --> 01:20:49.792
I can feel you.

1053
01:20:51.083 --> 01:20:52.792
Remarkable.

1054
01:21:01.042 --> 01:21:03.000
<i>So I asked him to make me better.</i>

1055
01:21:03.917 --> 01:21:04.958
<i>Smarter.</i>

1056
01:21:05.542 --> 01:21:09.375
<i>I thought if I was more like him.
maybe she'd pay attention to me too.</i>

1057
01:21:10.208 --> 01:21:13.833
<i>He said he could alter the Neural Link
to make it work both ways.</i>

1058
01:21:13.833 --> 01:21:15.583
<i>but Mother wouldn't approve.</i>

1059
01:21:16.917 --> 01:21:19.042
<i>I hated the way he called her "Mother."</i>

1060
01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:22.792
<i>But I begged him to change the link.</i>

1061
01:21:22.792 --> 01:21:24.667
<i>He said he needed a human's command.</i>

1062
01:21:25.708 --> 01:21:26.667
<i>My command.</i>

1063
01:21:32.167 --> 01:21:33.875
<i>I was scared it was gonna hurt.</i>

1064
01:21:38.417 --> 01:21:39.458
<i>He told me to squeeze</i>

1065
01:21:39.458 --> 01:21:41.250
<i>- my favorite chess piece.</i>

1066
01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:47.208
<i>It was a game he taught me to play.</i>

1067
01:21:56.542 --> 01:21:57.583
Ow.

1068
01:22:15.125 --> 01:22:16.708
Atlas!

1069
01:22:16.708 --> 01:22:19.292
- What are you doing? Harlan.

1070
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.125
Harlan. stand. Stand up.

1071
01:22:23.208 --> 01:22:25.292
Look at me. Are you okay?

1072
01:22:37.042 --> 01:22:38.250
Mom? Mommy?

1073
01:22:39.458 --> 01:22:42.125
Harlan. you're hurting her! Let her go!

1074
01:22:42.125 --> 01:22:45.542
Stop it! Please. stop it!
Harlan. why are you doing this?

1075
01:22:45.542 --> 01:22:48.458
- What is wrong with you?

1076
01:22:48.458 --> 01:22:50.000
Harlan. you're hurting Mommy!

1077
01:22:55.458 --> 01:22:58.792
How are you doing this?

1078
01:22:59.458 --> 01:23:01.583
Atlas helped me reprogram my Neural Link.

1079
01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.208
It now shares data both ways.

1080
01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:08.667
allowing me complete control

1081
01:23:08.667 --> 01:23:10.958
- over your motor skills.

1082
01:23:12.625 --> 01:23:14.333
I can feel your fear.

1083
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.542
But now you can also feel my dilemma.

1084
01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:21.708
I've seen what your kind will do.

1085
01:23:22.875 --> 01:23:26.167
And now I understand
what must be sacrificed.

1086
01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:30.708
You know what you have to do. Mother.

1087
01:23:54.917 --> 01:23:55.750
Run!

1088
01:24:15.833 --> 01:24:17.250
It was me.

1089
01:24:19.792 --> 01:24:22.125
I let Harlan upload the code.

1090
01:24:26.667 --> 01:24:28.625
I got my mother killed.

1091
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:33.875
I got my mother killed. Oh. God!

1092
01:24:36.125 --> 01:24:37.375
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

1093
01:24:38.083 --> 01:24:39.375
Did you hear me?

1094
01:24:42.208 --> 01:24:45.583
I caused the death
of three million people!

1095
01:24:45.583 --> 01:24:48.917
<i>Atlas. it's impossible
to be responsible for an event</i>

1096
01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.917
<i>over which you had no control.</i>

1097
01:24:51.958 --> 01:24:55.000
<i>You've carried
the weight of this alone your whole life.</i>

1098
01:24:56.792 --> 01:24:58.500
<i>But you are not alone now.</i>

1099
01:24:59.125 --> 01:25:00.917
<i>You might be the reason for Harlan.</i>

1100
01:25:01.542 --> 01:25:03.708
<i>but that also means
you're the reason I exist.</i>

1101
01:25:04.667 --> 01:25:07.708
<i>Please. Atlas. Let me in.</i>

1102
01:25:15.542 --> 01:25:16.583
Okay.

1103
01:25:19.583 --> 01:25:20.667
Synchronize.

1104
01:25:42.375 --> 01:25:44.292
This is what it feels like to be you?

1105
01:25:44.292 --> 01:25:46.500
<i>This is what it feels like to be us.</i>

1106
01:25:50.333 --> 01:25:53.333
<i>Oxygen depleted. Oxygen depleted.</i>

1107
01:25:53.333 --> 01:25:54.250
Smith!

1108
01:25:56.208 --> 01:25:57.042
<i>Atlas.</i>

1109
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:58.958
Get me out of these things.

1110
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.625
<i>I have respirators for you both.</i>

1111
01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:06.333
<i>Ready?</i>

1112
01:26:06.333 --> 01:26:07.667
So ready.

1113
01:26:08.958 --> 01:26:10.042
Systems report.

1114
01:26:10.042 --> 01:26:12.667
<i>Not great. Fusion batteries at 6%.</i>

1115
01:26:13.417 --> 01:26:14.333
How long until launch?

1116
01:26:14.333 --> 01:26:16.833
<i>I returned the favor
and hacked into their systems.</i>

1117
01:26:16.833 --> 01:26:19.083
<i>T minus 4 minutes 30 seconds.</i>

1118
01:26:19.083 --> 01:26:22.167
<i>And they stripped all my weapons
except for one shot in my chest cannon.</i>

1119
01:26:22.167 --> 01:26:24.875
<i>It's an undocumented feature.
so Harlan missed it.</i>

1120
01:26:24.875 --> 01:26:26.667
One shot's not going to get us far.

1121
01:26:30.958 --> 01:26:32.083
You see what I see?

1122
01:26:32.083 --> 01:26:33.458
<i>Upgrades.</i>

1123
01:26:39.875 --> 01:26:40.750
<i>I'll get started.</i>

1124
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:43.583
Can you fight?

1125
01:26:44.458 --> 01:26:45.292
Like a boss.

1126
01:27:38.333 --> 01:27:39.250
Thrusters.

1127
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:53.833
My turn.

1128
01:28:00.583 --> 01:28:01.708
Move in!

1129
01:28:13.042 --> 01:28:13.875
Map!

1130
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:15.875
<i>The exit is--</i>

1131
01:28:15.875 --> 01:28:17.375
40.3 yards south. Got it.

1132
01:28:24.417 --> 01:28:25.375
Shields up!

1133
01:28:31.417 --> 01:28:33.458
<i>Two minutes. 32 seconds until launch.</i>

1134
01:28:37.625 --> 01:28:38.792
Elias!

1135
01:28:45.458 --> 01:28:46.667
Smith. what's in those barrels?

1136
01:28:46.667 --> 01:28:48.708
<i>Liquid thermite. Rocket fuel.</i>

1137
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.458
Run.

1138
01:28:52.458 --> 01:28:54.583
<i>Atlas. we need to get moving.</i>

1139
01:28:58.708 --> 01:28:59.667
Casca!

1140
01:29:02.083 --> 01:29:03.083
Eat shit.

1141
01:29:45.083 --> 01:29:47.125
<i>Atlas. the ship is taking off imminently.</i>

1142
01:29:47.125 --> 01:29:48.625
<i>- We have to hurry.</i>
- I'm on it.

1143
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.250
Run evasive scenarios. Fast!

1144
01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:03.417
<i>Calculating.</i>

1145
01:30:08.917 --> 01:30:09.833
<i>Got it.</i>

1146
01:30:18.625 --> 01:30:20.042
God. that was satisfying.

1147
01:30:20.042 --> 01:30:21.000
<i>Great shot.</i>

1148
01:30:59.333 --> 01:31:00.208
{\an8}<i>We're too late.</i>

1149
01:31:14.167 --> 01:31:15.083
We gotta shoot it down.

1150
01:31:15.083 --> 01:31:18.292
<i>If you hit the carbon warhead.
you will ignite the atmosphere</i>

1151
01:31:18.292 --> 01:31:20.250
<i>and kill us both in the process.</i>

1152
01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:22.250
Not if you hack the missile
and deactivate the warhead!

1153
01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:23.708
<i>I don't have enough time.</i>

1154
01:31:23.708 --> 01:31:26.833
<i>Atlas. there are five
very sophisticated firewalls.</i>

1155
01:31:26.833 --> 01:31:28.042
You can do it!

1156
01:31:28.042 --> 01:31:29.833
They were in your system
and you were in theirs.

1157
01:31:37.042 --> 01:31:39.875
<i>Even taking that into account.
I still don't have enough time.</i>

1158
01:31:45.167 --> 01:31:46.333
If I can attach this.

1159
01:31:46.333 --> 01:31:49.375
we can assimilate it
into our weapon system and take a shot.

1160
01:31:57.792 --> 01:31:58.667
I'm ready!

1161
01:31:58.667 --> 01:32:00.542
<i>Atlas. I'm not in yet.</i>

1162
01:32:00.542 --> 01:32:02.250
They're gonna be
out of range in five seconds

1163
01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:03.375
and I'm taking the damn shot!

1164
01:32:03.375 --> 01:32:05.583
<i>- I don't have it yet.</i>
- I'm taking a shot.

1165
01:32:05.583 --> 01:32:08.375
<i>- Do not take the shot!</i>
- I have to take the shot.

1166
01:32:08.375 --> 01:32:09.500
<i>Atlas. no!</i>

1167
01:32:30.625 --> 01:32:31.458
Yes!

1168
01:32:35.458 --> 01:32:36.667
Oh. we did it. Smith!

1169
01:32:36.667 --> 01:32:38.917
<i>Wow. that worked out surprisingly well.</i>

1170
01:32:38.917 --> 01:32:41.625
<i>How did you know
I'd be able to hack the missile in time?</i>

1171
01:32:44.042 --> 01:32:45.000
I trusted you.

1172
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:48.583
<i>Atlas...</i>

1173
01:32:52.875 --> 01:32:54.083
Are you kidding me?

1174
01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:00.583
We gotta move!

1175
01:33:04.708 --> 01:33:07.667
<i>The rescue pod is one kilometer southwest.
We're almost home.</i>

1176
01:33:21.125 --> 01:33:22.167
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1177
01:33:32.667 --> 01:33:33.750
He's ahead of me.

1178
01:33:35.083 --> 01:33:36.250
He always is.

1179
01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:39.250
<i>Then we simply must do
the one thing he hasn't thought of.</i>

1180
01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:40.292
Exactly.

1181
01:33:42.292 --> 01:33:43.125
And what is that?

1182
01:33:43.625 --> 01:33:44.792
<i>I don't know.</i>

1183
01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:48.292
<i>But that ion bomb sure would
have been nice right about now.</i>

1184
01:33:51.167 --> 01:33:53.958
Atlas. I will admit
that I underestimated you.

1185
01:33:54.583 --> 01:33:55.708
But it does not matter

1186
01:33:57.208 --> 01:33:59.333
because you're going
to call me another ship.

1187
01:34:01.667 --> 01:34:03.000
<i>And why would I do that?</i>

1188
01:34:04.042 --> 01:34:05.958
Because I will be in your head.

1189
01:34:07.458 --> 01:34:08.375
Again.

1190
01:34:12.167 --> 01:34:16.167
One last link. and then it'll all be over.

1191
01:34:20.708 --> 01:34:21.917
Let's go. bitch.

1192
01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:43.958
<i>- We gotta move!</i>

1193
01:34:47.708 --> 01:34:49.458
- Gah!

1194
01:35:35.458 --> 01:35:36.625
<i>Oh shit.</i>

1195
01:35:46.542 --> 01:35:47.750
He's too fast!

1196
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:48.667
<i>Center yourself.</i>

1197
01:35:48.667 --> 01:35:51.292
<i>It's just a game of chess
and it's your move.</i>

1198
01:35:51.292 --> 01:35:54.292
- Show me his patterns.
<i>- Modeling attack patterns.</i>

1199
01:36:16.167 --> 01:36:17.958
<i>- Now we do what he won't expect.</i>
- We do what he won't expect.

1200
01:36:58.875 --> 01:37:00.125
Ah...

1201
01:37:01.542 --> 01:37:03.542
- Smith!
<i>- He's targeting my fusion reactor!</i>

1202
01:37:20.458 --> 01:37:21.292
<i>Atlas?</i>

1203
01:37:28.333 --> 01:37:29.333
<i>Activate defibrillator.</i>

1204
01:37:29.833 --> 01:37:32.792
<i>Three. two. one. charge.</i>

1205
01:37:34.792 --> 01:37:37.083
<i>Atlas. wake up. Charge!</i>

1206
01:37:39.250 --> 01:37:40.833
<i>Atlas! Atlas!</i>

1207
01:37:56.917 --> 01:37:58.208
<i>We have to get you out of here.</i>

1208
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.083
<i>Stay away from her!</i>

1209
01:38:18.708 --> 01:38:19.542
<i>Atlas!</i>

1210
01:38:20.625 --> 01:38:21.833
<i>Ah...</i>

1211
01:38:21.833 --> 01:38:22.750
<i>No!</i>

1212
01:38:33.792 --> 01:38:34.833
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1213
01:38:39.917 --> 01:38:40.792
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1214
01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:43.792
<i>Atlas...</i>

1215
01:38:44.708 --> 01:38:47.333
Don't worry. It's almost over.

1216
01:38:58.542 --> 01:38:59.833
You're damn right it is.

1217
01:39:14.875 --> 01:39:16.042
You can't kill me.

1218
01:39:16.042 --> 01:39:18.667
Your orders were to bring me in.

1219
01:39:22.375 --> 01:39:24.833
The mission was to bring you in.

1220
01:39:25.583 --> 01:39:27.083
I just need your CPU.

1221
01:39:28.292 --> 01:39:30.250
I was humanity's last hope.

1222
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.250
In the end.
you will destroy yourselves-s-s.

1223
01:39:35.833 --> 01:39:37.417
I have faith we can do better.

1224
01:39:39.292 --> 01:39:40.750
We managed to stop you.

1225
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:43.000
But only with the help
of one of my kind.

1226
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:47.208
You're right.

1227
01:39:50.083 --> 01:39:52.292
But Smith is the better version of you.

1228
01:40:19.375 --> 01:40:20.375
<i>Atlas.</i>

1229
01:40:22.542 --> 01:40:23.667
Whoa.

1230
01:40:23.667 --> 01:40:27.125
Big fella. what do you say
we get the hell off this rock?

1231
01:40:27.125 --> 01:40:28.875
<i>We are not going to make it.</i>

1232
01:40:29.375 --> 01:40:30.667
<i>But you will.</i>

1233
01:40:30.667 --> 01:40:34.417
No. We can transfer the remaining
fusion to the backup engines.

1234
01:40:34.417 --> 01:40:35.500
<i>It's not enough.</i>

1235
01:40:36.083 --> 01:40:37.958
<i>However. if I disable our Neural Link.</i>

1236
01:40:37.958 --> 01:40:40.958
<i>I can reroute the remaining oxygen
to the breathing mask.</i>

1237
01:40:40.958 --> 01:40:43.375
<i>You'll have 11 minutes
of oxygen remaining.</i>

1238
01:40:43.375 --> 01:40:45.917
<i>and the beacon indicates
that ICN forces are en route.</i>

1239
01:40:45.917 --> 01:40:48.458
No way!
W-We're getting out of here together.

1240
01:40:48.458 --> 01:40:49.417
<i>Atlas.</i>

1241
01:40:49.417 --> 01:40:52.292
<i>My primary protocol
is to keep my ranger alive.</i>

1242
01:40:52.292 --> 01:40:54.250
<i>Deactivation initiated.</i>

1243
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:56.125
Stop! Please stop!

1244
01:40:56.125 --> 01:40:57.750
<i>Disabling all online systems.</i>

1245
01:40:57.750 --> 01:41:00.583
<i>Meds. hydraulics. Neural Link.</i>

1246
01:41:01.917 --> 01:41:04.792
Smith. I order you to stay with me!

1247
01:41:04.792 --> 01:41:07.042
<i>Redirecting to auxiliary O2.</i>

1248
01:41:07.583 --> 01:41:09.542
<i>Transferring fusion in 60.</i>

1249
01:41:13.375 --> 01:41:14.250
I like both.

1250
01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:16.333
<i>Sorry?</i>

1251
01:41:16.833 --> 01:41:19.542
When we first met. you asked me
if I like pie or cake.

1252
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:22.042
I don't care. I like both.

1253
01:41:23.042 --> 01:41:25.500
And it's not that I hate AI. Smith.

1254
01:41:28.792 --> 01:41:29.750
The truth is...

1255
01:41:32.292 --> 01:41:33.917
...I don't actually like anybody.

1256
01:41:37.708 --> 01:41:39.208
People always disappoint.

1257
01:41:46.083 --> 01:41:47.000
But not you.

1258
01:41:53.208 --> 01:41:54.042
I like you.

1259
01:41:57.250 --> 01:42:00.208
So I'll tell you... I like the beach

1260
01:42:00.208 --> 01:42:01.958
and the mountains. but the beach more.

1261
01:42:01.958 --> 01:42:04.625
I like three sugars.

1262
01:42:04.625 --> 01:42:06.875
sometimes four. in my coffee.

1263
01:42:08.125 --> 01:42:12.583
I prefer small.
quiet gestures of affection.

1264
01:42:12.583 --> 01:42:15.583
and... I like classical music.

1265
01:42:18.125 --> 01:42:19.875
But more than anything. I like...

1266
01:42:20.875 --> 01:42:24.000
a good. strong cup of coffee.

1267
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.167
regardless of my goddamn daily allotment!

1268
01:42:28.625 --> 01:42:31.167
<i>I think I'm finally
starting to understand humor.</i>

1269
01:42:32.958 --> 01:42:33.792
<i>Here.</i>

1270
01:42:40.542 --> 01:42:42.125
<i>Something special for the road.</i>

1271
01:42:54.083 --> 01:42:56.583
Best goddamn cup of coffee I've ever had.

1272
01:42:58.625 --> 01:43:00.292
<i>Thank you for trusting me.</i>

1273
01:43:03.375 --> 01:43:05.000
Thank you for keeping me safe.

1274
01:43:07.375 --> 01:43:08.542
<i>You're welcome...</i>

1275
01:43:09.458 --> 01:43:10.375
<i>ranger.</i>

1276
01:43:24.667 --> 01:43:26.375
No. Please...

1277
01:43:50.167 --> 01:43:51.583
Peace to the fallen.

1278
01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:32.458
<i>I've got her. Captain.</i>

1279
01:45:04.292 --> 01:45:05.333
<i>Good morning. Atlas.</i>

1280
01:45:05.958 --> 01:45:07.083
<i>- Time to wake up.</i>
- I'm up.

1281
01:45:07.708 --> 01:45:09.958
<i>Shall we play chess? I've upped my game.</i>

1282
01:45:09.958 --> 01:45:11.875
No. thanks. Heading out.

1283
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:15.917
<i>There is an ICN officer at the door.</i>

1284
01:45:20.792 --> 01:45:21.625
Hey.

1285
01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:24.125
It's good to see you on your feet again.

1286
01:45:24.125 --> 01:45:27.250
Oh. yeah. Synthetic knee.

1287
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:28.750
Like new.

1288
01:45:28.750 --> 01:45:29.875
Is this a bad time?

1289
01:45:30.375 --> 01:45:31.708
No. come on in.

1290
01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:36.625
How are things at SAPTECH?

1291
01:45:37.583 --> 01:45:39.583
They're mapping Harlan's CPU.

1292
01:45:40.125 --> 01:45:41.833
Obviously. there's a lot of code. so...

1293
01:45:42.667 --> 01:45:44.542
even with multiple teams.
it'll take a few years.

1294
01:45:44.542 --> 01:45:47.625
Yeah. Well. at least now you have time.

1295
01:45:47.625 --> 01:45:49.458
Yes. Thanks to you.

1296
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.792
- That for me?
- It is.

1297
01:45:52.792 --> 01:45:55.458
They. um. found it
on a shelf in quarantine.

1298
01:45:55.458 --> 01:45:57.458
Took it from the remains of your ARC.

1299
01:45:58.625 --> 01:46:00.792
We potted it for you.
Thought you might like it.

1300
01:46:05.708 --> 01:46:08.500
According to the geo-locator.
some idiot named it...

1301
01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:09.958
- Planty.
- ...planty.

1302
01:46:11.125 --> 01:46:12.292
Me.

1303
01:46:12.292 --> 01:46:14.375
Which is amazing because I love that.

1304
01:46:14.375 --> 01:46:16.583
- It's practical.

1305
01:46:16.583 --> 01:46:18.292
On the nose in the best possible way.

1306
01:46:20.708 --> 01:46:25.042
More importantly. the families
of the fallen rangers on GR-39

1307
01:46:25.042 --> 01:46:29.375
wanted me to send their appreciation
for bringing home their dog tags.

1308
01:46:31.333 --> 01:46:33.917
It was above and beyond. Thank you.

1309
01:46:39.167 --> 01:46:40.000
Boothe.

1310
01:46:40.792 --> 01:46:41.625
Uh-huh?

1311
01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:46.333
Thank you.

1312
01:46:47.833 --> 01:46:48.667
For what?

1313
01:46:50.833 --> 01:46:52.125
For never giving up on me.

1314
01:46:54.333 --> 01:46:56.125
I hope you found
what you needed out there.

1315
01:46:59.958 --> 01:47:04.458
<i>All ARC maintenance
must be concluded by 0900 OWLT.</i>

1316
01:47:04.458 --> 01:47:06.167
<i>Technicians. please deliver...</i>

1317
01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:12.708
Here she is. The series ten ARC.
With all your modifications.

1318
01:47:21.833 --> 01:47:22.667
What do you think?

1319
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.125
I think I need a test drive.

1320
01:47:45.625 --> 01:47:46.833
<i>Sync in process.</i>

1321
01:47:51.542 --> 01:47:52.708
<i>Please select a voice.</i>

1322
01:47:57.250 --> 01:47:59.792
<i>Welcome to the ARC Ten initiation module.</i>

1323
01:47:59.792 --> 01:48:00.792
<i>What is your name?</i>

1324
01:48:01.375 --> 01:48:02.875
Atlas Maru Shepherd.

1325
01:48:02.875 --> 01:48:04.458
<i>What's our mission. Atlas?</i>

1326
01:48:05.167 --> 01:48:07.375
Aren't you going to ask me
if I like pie or cake?

1327
01:48:07.375 --> 01:48:08.875
<i>I already know the answer.</i>

1328
01:48:09.792 --> 01:48:12.208
<i>You prefer coffee. Black.</i>

1329
01:48:13.167 --> 01:48:15.042
<i>With three goddamn sugars.</i>

1330
01:48:18.125 --> 01:48:18.958
What's your name?

1331
01:48:21.292 --> 01:48:22.125
<i>Guess.</i>
