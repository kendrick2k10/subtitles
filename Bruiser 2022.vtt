529
00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:01.782
I put us through as kids.

530
00:29:01.782 --> 00:29:03.867
You know.
that was all my fault.

531
00:29:03.867 --> 00:29:06.453
I own up to that. you know.

532
00:29:06.453 --> 00:29:09.998
But. um. you know
we're here now.

533
00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:11.959
You know.
I'm a a grown man now.

534
00:29:11.959 --> 00:29:15.462
you know. and this is
all about Darious.

535
00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:17.464
So it's real good
to see you. Monica.

536
00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:21.969
You. too. bruh.

537
00:29:21.969 --> 00:29:25.138
MALCOLM:
Why'd you come back?

538
00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:28.725
I mean. why come back now?

539
00:29:28.725 --> 00:29:31.979
- Like. you know. man.
six years in the air force.

540
00:29:31.979 --> 00:29:34.648
little time out in Vegas.

541
00:29:34.648 --> 00:29:36.066
Just trying to find my way.

542
00:29:38.318 --> 00:29:40.737
Everything has just
led me back here. you know?

543
00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:45.409
Led me back home to you guys
and Darious. my family.

544
00:29:48.036 --> 00:29:49.454
HECTOR:
Can I get you anything. sir?

545
00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:50.956
PORTER:
I'll take a coffee. man.

546
00:29:50.956 --> 00:29:52.708
HECTOR:
Coffee.

547
00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:54.835
PORTER:
It's good to see you. Hector.

548
00:29:54.835 --> 00:29:56.169
- Do I know you?

549
00:29:56.169 --> 00:29:58.839
- It is Porter. man. you know.
Porter.

550
00:29:58.839 --> 00:30:00.090
I used to come in here
with Malcolm.

551
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.174
HECTOR:
Porter.

552
00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:03.051
Of course.
I didn't recognize you

553
00:30:03.051 --> 00:30:05.971
with your tattoos. your hair.

554
00:30:05.971 --> 00:30:08.682
You got big.
[both chuckle]

555
00:30:08.682 --> 00:30:10.183
How good to see you.

556
00:30:10.183 --> 00:30:12.060
PORTER: Good to see you. man.
HECTOR: Enjoy.

557
00:30:14.354 --> 00:30:16.565
- Surprised the old man
is still working here.

558
00:30:16.565 --> 00:30:19.901
- Well. he's a close friend
of ours.

559
00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:24.114
I teach his granddaughter
violin. actually.

560
00:30:24.114 --> 00:30:25.824
- I see you're still playing.

561
00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:27.242
Does Darious play?

562
00:30:27.242 --> 00:30:28.368
- I tried with him.

563
00:30:28.368 --> 00:30:29.828
He doesn't have the patience.

564
00:30:32.414 --> 00:30:36.251
- So. uh. you know.
what does he. uh.

565
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:38.420
what does he know about me?

566
00:30:42.132 --> 00:30:43.675
- Why don't we
keep the conversation

567
00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:46.553
on getting reacquainted
for now?

568
00:30:46.553 --> 00:30:48.180
All right. you say that
you're here for Darious.

569
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.474
What does that mean?
Can you explain that?

570
00:30:52.267 --> 00:30:54.811
- Meaning that I wanna be
in his life. you know?

571
00:30:54.811 --> 00:30:57.647
I mean. if you guys
let me. of course.

572
00:30:57.647 --> 00:31:03.070
- Oh. Porter.
we appreciate your apology.

573
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.613
That means a lot.

574
00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:09.618
But you walked out on us.

575
00:31:09.618 --> 00:31:12.287
and you can't come back
after 12 years

576
00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:14.164
and have it go back to normal.

577
00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:18.418
- Yeah. I understand that.

578
00:31:18.418 --> 00:31:20.462
You know. I know it'll
take time to get warm.

579
00:31:20.462 --> 00:31:23.381
but I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

580
00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:27.511
You know. everything is
on your terms completely.

581
00:31:27.511 --> 00:31:29.888
- All right. then.

582
00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:32.182
- You know. uh...

583
00:31:34.351 --> 00:31:36.603
I was thinking about this
the other day.

584
00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:41.191
Remember your nickname. Nini?

585
00:31:41.191 --> 00:31:42.859
Yeah.

586
00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:44.528
Yeah. I remember that shit
we used to get into.

587
00:31:46.613 --> 00:31:48.782
Remember that Charger
you used to have. man?

588
00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:52.494
I know you remember.
- Mm-hmm. I sold it.

589
00:31:52.494 --> 00:31:53.870
- Remember that time you was
in the front seat with him

590
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:55.413
and damn near broke your foot

591
00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:57.457
'cause you stepped on the damn
floor 'cause it was all rusty?

592
00:31:57.457 --> 00:31:58.834
- Ugh.

593
00:31:58.834 --> 00:32:00.085
PORTER:
I know you remember that.

594
00:32:00.085 --> 00:32:01.336
I know you remember it.
too. why you trying

595
00:32:01.336 --> 00:32:02.754
to hold that laugh. man?

596
00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.756
- That rusty piece of shit.

597
00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:06.508
- I loved that car.
PORTER: Uh-huh.

598
00:32:06.508 --> 00:32:07.968
- It was hard for me to part
with it. but I loved it.

599
00:32:07.968 --> 00:32:10.095
MONICA:
I told him there was no way

600
00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:11.471
Darious was riding around
in it.

601
00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:14.349
- Yeah. and I got rid of it.
thank you very much.

602
00:32:14.349 --> 00:32:16.685
- Actually. uh.
since we're being

603
00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:18.854
all open and honest
and everything.

604
00:32:18.854 --> 00:32:20.355
I want to. uh--

605
00:32:22.732 --> 00:32:24.526
I met Darious.

606
00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:26.111
You know. it was--
it was a complete accident.

607
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:28.780
He just--he just
came by where I stay.

608
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.282
- Excuse me?

609
00:32:30.282 --> 00:32:33.660
- Yeah. it was a couple of days
ago out by Jon's old place

610
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.328
and. like. he got
beat up by a kid

611
00:32:35.328 --> 00:32:36.413
or something. all blooded up.

612
00:32:36.413 --> 00:32:38.165
- Did you tell him
who you were?

613
00:32:38.165 --> 00:32:39.457
PORTER:
When I introduced myself.

614
00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:41.001
it didn't seem like
he knew who I was.

615
00:32:42.878 --> 00:32:44.379
I told him my name and he--

616
00:32:44.379 --> 00:32:46.173
- I don't know why the fuck
you think he'd know your name.

617
00:32:46.173 --> 00:32:48.383
You're irrelevant.
and I guess that's

618
00:32:48.383 --> 00:32:49.801
for Nini to decide. right?

619
00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:52.304
- It was my decision to make.

620
00:32:52.304 --> 00:32:53.889
He knows I didn't
have him with Malcolm.

621
00:32:53.889 --> 00:32:55.223
and I didn't tell him
about you.

622
00:32:55.223 --> 00:32:56.266
and I'm sorry about that.

623
00:32:56.266 --> 00:32:57.350
- You don't gotta
apologize to him.

624
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.476
He wasn't here.

625
00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:00.103
- Did you tell him
who you were?

626
00:33:00.103 --> 00:33:02.397
- No. I promise.

627
00:33:02.397 --> 00:33:03.523
MALCOLM: And I don't know
how the fuck you think

628
00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:05.066
he'd know who you are.

629
00:33:05.066 --> 00:33:06.902
- Don't know why the fuck you
let my kid get his ass beat--

630
00:33:06.902 --> 00:33:08.278
- It ain't got nothing to do
with you in the first place.

631
00:33:08.278 --> 00:33:09.529
And the fact that
you think it does--

632
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:10.864
- Of course. it does.
Bruh. that's my son.

633
00:33:10.864 --> 00:33:13.575
What you mean. man?
- He's your kid.

634
00:33:13.575 --> 00:33:16.077
PORTER: That's my son.
MALCOLM: You believe that?

635
00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:17.287
Is that what you think?

636
00:33:17.287 --> 00:33:19.831
- Okay. stop.
Please stop it.

637
00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:21.208
PORTER:
I'm sorry.

638
00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:23.210
I just wanna meet Darious.

639
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:25.462
You know.
I just wanna meet my son.

640
00:33:25.462 --> 00:33:26.630
- Well. unfortunately--

641
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.964
- We would need
to discuss it together

642
00:33:27.964 --> 00:33:30.258
between the two of us.

643
00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:32.385
PORTER: Look. I get
the hostility. man.

644
00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:33.887
I really do.

645
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.476
But I'm reformed. bro.

646
00:33:39.476 --> 00:33:41.728
I ain't that little boy
you used to know.

647
00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:44.105
I can promise you that.

648
00:33:44.105 --> 00:33:46.399
- I understand.
but you need to trust us

649
00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:49.277
that we listened to you
and we need to go

650
00:33:49.277 --> 00:33:51.404
and talk about it together.

651
00:33:51.404 --> 00:33:52.697
Okay?

652
00:33:55.242 --> 00:33:56.785
- Yeah. I appreciate that.

653
00:33:58.286 --> 00:33:59.287
- Okay.

654
00:34:02.916 --> 00:34:03.917
Okay.

655
00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:25.814
MALCOLM: I don't think
this is a good idea.

656
00:34:25.814 --> 00:34:27.649
I really don't think
we should let him in.

657
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:31.069
<i>[pensive music]</i>

658
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:33.029
MONICA: There's so much pain
in the world.

659
00:34:35.365 --> 00:34:37.033
Let's just be good to Porter.

660
00:34:37.033 --> 00:34:39.244
and the Lord
will be good to us.

661
00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:46.501
- So he's my real father.

662
00:34:46.501 --> 00:34:48.169
- He is not your real dad.

663
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:50.505
Malcolm raised you.
Malcolm's your father.

664
00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:52.924
Porter is the man I had
you with when I was young.

665
00:34:54.634 --> 00:34:56.428
- So why didn't you
stay with him?

666
00:34:56.428 --> 00:34:59.806
- We were too young and he
wasn't ready to raise you.

667
00:34:59.806 --> 00:35:01.433
- Why?

668
00:35:01.433 --> 00:35:03.310
Why wasn't he ready?

669
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.728
- Because--

670
00:35:04.728 --> 00:35:06.354
- Because some people.
they run from their problems.

671
00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:11.026
- I was a problem?
- No. honey. of course not.

672
00:35:11.026 --> 00:35:12.777
- No. no. no. of course not.
No.

673
00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:15.905
That's just how Porter
saw you. saw the situ--

674
00:35:18.241 --> 00:35:21.036
Do you even want to see him?

675
00:35:21.036 --> 00:35:24.497
- Yeah. he's cool.

676
00:35:24.497 --> 00:35:27.125
- Okay. Okay.

677
00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:30.211
Well. in that case. we all
need to be there as a family

678
00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:32.505
because your dad and I.
we're still

679
00:35:32.505 --> 00:35:33.840
getting reacquainted with him.

680
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.217
- And I don't think we're ready
for all that yet.

681
00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:38.803
And I know your mother and I
still gotta talk about

682
00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:39.929
if we want to let you
around Porter.

683
00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:41.681
- I thought we talked about it.

684
00:35:41.681 --> 00:35:44.809
- And I think that we are not
ready for that yet. Monica.

685
00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:47.020
- What is there
left to talk about?

686
00:35:49.356 --> 00:35:51.066
- We don't know yet.
but when we decide.

687
00:35:51.066 --> 00:35:52.817
we will let you know.

688
00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:55.403
Okay? Is that okay with you?

689
00:35:55.403 --> 00:35:56.404
- Sure.

690
00:35:58.656 --> 00:35:59.866
- Okay.

691
00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:03.662
Family hug. Come on.

692
00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.420
I love you.

693
00:36:22.055 --> 00:36:24.140
- Check this out.

694
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.183
Boom.

Yep. Okay.

Yeah. okay.
