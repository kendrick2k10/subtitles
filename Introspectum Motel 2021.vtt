3
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.283
- Babe. it's fine.

4
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.203
- Not quite.

5
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.923
Better?

6
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.720
- There's something missing.

7
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.870
- You know. we should do something.

8
00:01:39.857 --> 00:01:40.837
- Like what?

9
00:01:40.837 --> 00:01:43.070
- Do you fancy a meal?

10
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.170
- A meal?

11
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.583
Sure. what should I make?

12
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.850
It was a joke.

13
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.893
- Yeah. I bet.

14
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.940
How about that new restaurant tomorrow?

15
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.020
- Tomorrow I'm not sure I can.

16
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.660
I've got a meeting with
Tim at the new site.

17
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.190
It's quite a way.

18
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.860
- Oh. come on. babe.

19
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.920
Spend a bit of time with me.

20
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.220
It's Christmas. fuck work.

21
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.950
- It's important.

22
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.883
If it all goes to plan.
it's a hell of a pay rise.

23
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.892
- Well. I could come with you then.

24
00:02:13.892 --> 00:02:14.792
We could do lunch.

25
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.960
- Honey.

26
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.410
That's impossible. I'm sorry.

27
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.163
- Yeah. I know.

28
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.930
Stupid idea.

29
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.813
- Look. I'll try and
come home early. okay?

30
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.080
A date. huh?

31
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.913
Is that what you want?

32
00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:51.659
- Say I love you.

33
00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.491
- I love you.

34
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:55.321
- Keep saying it.
- I love you.

35
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:57.488
- Don't stop.
- I love you.

36
00:02:58.481 --> 00:03:01.320
I love you.
- Love you too.

37
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.684
- I love you.

38
00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:07.702
I love you.

39
00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:09.896
I love you.

40
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.307
I love you.

41
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.403
- Hey. let me do that.

42
00:03:48.403 --> 00:03:49.320
- All done.

43
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.993
- Ah. I really hope
Chloe is gonna be okay.

44
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.100
- She'll be fine. honey.

45
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.593
Mom and dad will spoil her.

46
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.550
There was a dead fly in my face cream.

47
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.473
- Okay.

48
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.140
- It's not breaking news. Susan. just odd.

49
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.792
Are there flies in winter?

50
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:19.603
- What?

51
00:04:20.803 --> 00:04:22.003
You'll be late for work.

52
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.320
- Welcome to Walk of Art.

53
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.110
If you need any help. please let me know.

54
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.943
- Thank you.

55
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.403
Excuse me.
- Sir?

56
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.533
- I want this.

57
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:16.810
- A wise choice for a lucky lady.

58
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.970
It's my favorite color.

59
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.803
- Mine too.

60
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.170
Reminds me of something my
grandmother used to say.

61
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.003
What was it?

62
00:05:26.487 --> 00:05:29.890
"Love is ever green and never jealous."

63
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.280
- Did you know green is the
color of both love and envy?

64
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.360
No.

65
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.410
- It's an amusing contradiction.

66
00:05:55.052 --> 00:05:55.885
Sir.

67
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.483
- Thank you.

68
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.543
- Merry Christmas.

69
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.123
- 20% more.

70
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.090
Forget it.

71
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.253
We cannot afford to lose him.

72
00:06:14.253 --> 00:06:15.593
He's a prime investor.

73
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.280
- Fuck him and his investment.

74
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.550
You tell him from me.

75
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.300
if he doesn't want to work with us.

76
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.343
step aside. others will.

77
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.772
It's his loss. Tim. not ours.

78
00:06:28.772 --> 00:06:30.660
Jesus. are you sure about this?

79
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.260
- Of course I'm sure.

80
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.520
Nobody plays me for a fool.

81
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.620
Okay. fine. but
he will not be happy.

82
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.860
- Yeah. yeah.

83
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.693
Fuck him.

84
00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:44.679
Whatever.

85
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.100
- Good afternoon. sir.

86
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.760
And welcome to the Orpheus Motel.

87
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.320
I'm Nina. how may I be of service?

88
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.470
- Very professional.

89
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.160
- New year. new management.

90
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.690
It's all changed.

91
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.030
Thought I'd get some practice in.

92
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.530
What do you think?

93
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.513
- Well. you look great.

94
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.360
Hey. where's Steve?

95
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.170
- Oh.
- I thought he was in today.

96
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.630
- He's sick. everyone is.

97
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.830
It's the flu.

98
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.600
Well. man flu.

99
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.958
- Well. I never get sick.

100
00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:34.791
Healthy living.

101
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.046
Here. Merry Christmas.

102
00:07:41.046 --> 00:07:42.453
- Oh. thanks.

103
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.860
It's quiet.

104
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.180
- Yeah. for now. we're fully booked.

105
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.690
Got a big conference.
but nobody's here yet.

106
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.020
- Well. it's party season.

107
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.840
so they're probably in town getting drunk.

108
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.360
- I may join them.

109
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.210
It's better than being stuck here.

110
00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.540
- Sounds like a plan.

111
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.540
Hey. if my client doesn't
show. why don't we do that?

112
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.100
- Do what?

113
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.500
Go for a drink?

114
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.770
- Oh. thanks for the offer. but-

115
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:15.863
- What?

116
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.780
- You're not my type.

117
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.613
Sorry.

118
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.643
- What type am I then?

119
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:28.903
- The older married type.

120
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.110
- I meant as a friend. Nina.

121
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.093
You misunderstood.

122
00:08:35.857 --> 00:08:37.457
Aren't you forgetting something?

123
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.573
- Key!
- It would help.

124
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:44.733
- Room seven.

125
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.100
Your key. sir.

126
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.320
And enjoy your stay.

127
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.270
- Cute.

128
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.600
Don't forget my wake-up call.

129
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.650
- The same as usual?

130
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.470
7:00 on the dot.

131
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.769
- Done.

132
00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.810
Room service.

133
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:03.060
- Yes. I'd like champagne
on ice with two glasses.

134
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.920
delivered to room seven
at nine o'clock sharp.

135
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.100
Of course. sir.

136
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:07.933
- Thanks.

137
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:35.770
You gotta be kidding me.

138
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.953
And fuck you. too.

139
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.513
Bitch.

140
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.340
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thanks.

141
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.170
- Nina?

142
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.023
Batteries.

143
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.970
- Don't worry. I'll fix it.

144
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.510
No rush.

145
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.343
- Hey. Philippe.

146
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.133
Healthy living.
- Yeah. yeah.

147
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.283
Sorry. have you got a light?

148
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.622
Thanks.
- No problem.

149
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.270
- I'm Paul.
- Philippe.

150
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.220
- Nice to meet you.

151
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.363
Amazing view.

152
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.623
- I guess.

153
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.773
- Really. I think it's beautiful.

154
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.490
You know they run
meditation workshops here.

155
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.960
Trying to convince work to
let me bring the students up.

156
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.313
Increasing concentration
by relieving stress.

157
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.000
- You're a teacher?

158
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.620
- Lecturer. but yeah.

159
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.290
Comparative religious studies.

160
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.730
Yeah. I know it sounds boring.

161
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.163
Maybe it is. but anyway.

162
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.163
Here for a conference.
but no one's turned up.

163
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.107
Missed connection or
delay. something like that.

164
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:44.973
What about you?

165
00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:45.930
What are you here for?

166
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.723
- As it turns out. I'm
in the same boat as you.

167
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.490
- Yeah. what do you mean?

168
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.040
- Was supposed to meet someone.

169
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.473
Doesn't matter.

170
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.330
- No. no. I'll listen if you want.

171
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.493
- It's a long story.

172
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:08.530
I'll go grab some food.

173
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.363
Catch you later.

174
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.043
- Hello?

175
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.733
- Thanks.
- No problem.

176
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.280
Look after your room key.

177
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.558
I can't find the spare.

178
00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:36.880
- Shame. I was hoping you'd
sneak in and fuck my brains out.

179
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.540
- I apologize. okay?

180
00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.197
Get that crap all the time.

181
00:13:40.197 --> 00:13:42.253
It's hard to know if
someone's being sincere.

182
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.153
- Forget it.

183
00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:57.963
- Good evening. sir.

184
00:13:57.963 --> 00:13:59.030
Ready to order?

185
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:04.030
- Yes. I'd like the soupe aux champignons.

186
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.110
followed by filet mignon. rare.

187
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.397
- And to drink?
- Merlot.

188
00:14:09.397 --> 00:14:11.340
- Large or small?
- The bottle.

189
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.190
- Very good. sir.

190
00:14:29.267 --> 00:14:30.510
- Hi. daddy.

191
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.145
I miss you. I'm really
excited for Christmas.

192
00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:37.075
- Thank you.

193
00:14:54.355 --> 00:14:55.188
- Evening.

194
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.220
Well. I was going to ask you
if you wanted a drink. but-

195
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.193
- Help yourself.

196
00:15:03.983 --> 00:15:04.983
- Thank you.

197
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.663
I was thinking of heading
into town in a bit.

198
00:15:14.605 --> 00:15:16.155
A few drinks. find some action.

199
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.040
Wanna come?

200
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.280
Come on.

201
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.563
While the cat's away.

202
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.610
While the cat's away. the mice will play.

203
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.670
You don't know that one?

204
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.433
- Mice don't play.

205
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.490
They get stupid and caught in traps.

206
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.323
Snap. snap.

207
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.203
- Oh. not all mice are stupid.

208
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.050
I once knew a mouse that was so clever

209
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:48.457
it could steal bait from a
trap without getting caught.

210
00:15:48.457 --> 00:15:49.957
Until it got caught of course.

211
00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.840
- You knew this mouse personally?

212
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.533
Was he a close friend?

213
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.873
- I knew of a mouse. it's better.

214
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.130
And he was a she.

215
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.610
- Hm. one of the crafty ones.

216
00:16:10.646 --> 00:16:12.140
To clever mice.

217
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.293
- Long may their tails twitch.

218
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.973
So. the girl at reception.

219
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.830
- Nina. she's okay.

220
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.183
Why. you interested?

221
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.755
- Oh. she's nice.

222
00:16:31.755 --> 00:16:33.723
- Nice means you wanna fuck her.

223
00:16:35.664 --> 00:16:37.464
- Wouldn't you. given half a chance?

224
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.980
Ah. you're bullshitting me.

225
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.813
- Nah.

226
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.310
I'm not her type.

227
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.563
Too old apparently.

228
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.143
The downside of hitting 30.

229
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.563
The feast slowly becomes a famine.

230
00:16:59.222 --> 00:17:00.840
Tell you something though.

231
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.810
chick before Nina. what was her name?

232
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.760
Shit. it doesn't matter.

233
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.880
She had the biggest pair
of tits I'd ever seen.

234
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.803
Just beautiful.
- Whoa!

235
00:17:13.382 --> 00:17:15.890
- I wanted to fuck her so much.

236
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.240
- Did ya?
- We hooked up on night.

237
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.173
but that's all.

238
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.350
- While the cat's away.

239
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.213
- Sorry.

240
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:27.610
I'm on the wine. I talk shit.

241
00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:29.270
- Do you want to get a coffee?

242
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.923
- Nah. I gotta piss.

243
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.663
Back in a minute.

244
00:17:50.455 --> 00:17:52.205
It's just one person.

245
00:17:55.895 --> 00:17:56.895
One opinion.

246
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.543
Fuck it.

247
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.443
- I know.

248
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.527
Oh. yeah. it's okay.

249
00:18:15.527 --> 00:18:17.960
He's here now. one sec.

250
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.793
It's your wife.

251
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.143
- Honey. it's me.

252
00:18:24.143 --> 00:18:25.043
Are you okay?

253
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.823
The meeting's over.

254
00:18:27.823 --> 00:18:29.400
We had a few drinks to celebrate.

255
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.853
No I had a drink. I won't drive home.

256
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.250
Better safe than sorry.

257
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.793
Honey. I've gotta go.

258
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.623
I'll see you tomorrow.

259
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.340
Yeah. I love you. too.

260
00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.173
Bye.

261
00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.003
Why answer my phone?

262
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.360
- I am so sorry.

263
00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.000
I. I thought it might be important.

264
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.323
- I don't need a fucking secretary.

265
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.546
Who is it?

266
00:19:24.546 --> 00:19:25.513
Good evening. sir.

267
00:19:25.513 --> 00:19:29.957
You ordered champagne.

268
00:19:29.957 --> 00:19:31.660
- You're early.

269
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.983
I said 9:00.

270
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:50.833
- Surprise.

271
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:28.223
Miss me?

272
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.633
- Every time you leave. I'm jealous.

273
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.613
- Don't be.

274
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.053
I don't fuck him anymore.

275
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.973
I'm all yours.

276
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.643
I think I'm falling for you.

277
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.573
- You can't.

278
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.400
I'm not leaving my husband.

279
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.550
You're not leaving your family.

280
00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.623
We agreed. right?

281
00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.763
You promised.

282
00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.873
- I don't always keep my promises.

283
00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:05.353
- You're a naughty man.

284
00:23:08.647 --> 00:23:10.833
But let's keep it light between us. okay?

285
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.313
Just enjoy ourselves.

286
00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.343
Have some fun.

287
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.553
- Why?

288
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.093
I know you feel the same.

289
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.650
Besides I need you.

290
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.823
- No. you just wanna fuck me.

291
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.270
- Can't you see that
it's more than just that?

292
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:32.103
It's perfect.

293
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.720
- Let's go out.

294
00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.440
Find a bar. get drunk.

295
00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.690
I think I need to catch up.

296
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.090
- Why not call room service?

297
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.900
- It's not the same.

298
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.430
I wanna dance.

299
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.980
I wanna have some fun with you.

300
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.743
You think too much.

301
00:23:53.266 --> 00:23:55.060
Let some chaos in.

302
00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.813
- I can't dance and I hate chaos.

303
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.363
- You'll be too drunk to care.

304
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:02.063
Trust me.

305
00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:08.920
- Hey. Nina.

306
00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.730
You driving to town?

307
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.050
- I have a taxi outside.

308
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:12.960
- Can we share it?

309
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.500
I'll pay.

310
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.597
- If you insist.

311
00:24:27.407 --> 00:24:29.847
What do
you like best about me?

312
00:24:29.847 --> 00:24:30.847
- About you?

313
00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.593
I like your smile. your sense of humor.

314
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:39.603
the way you make me feel.

315
00:24:41.196 --> 00:24:42.029
And...

316
00:24:44.215 --> 00:24:45.048
- What?

317
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:47.743
- I feel safe.

318
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.493
What about you?

319
00:24:53.715 --> 00:24:55.403
- It's the way you look at me.

320
00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.163
I look into those eyes and
everything else just fades away.

321
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.313
Feels like home.

322
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.613
Do you believe in fate?

323
00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.210
- I don't know.

324
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:15.043
Like what?

325
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:21.150
- Do you believe people meet
and things happen for a reason?

326
00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.510
- You mean like a plan?

327
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.410
Yeah.

328
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.283
I believe in luck. not fate.

329
00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.283
So. you don't think
we're fated to be together?

330
00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.420
- Maybe we were just lucky

331
00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.823
to have found one another.

332
00:25:41.156 --> 00:25:41.989
Dance with me.

333
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:49.993
See. you're not so bad.

334
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.373
- I love you.

335
00:26:13.126 --> 00:26:14.380
Room service.

336
00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.180
- Another bottle of
champagne for room seven.

337
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.210
Very good. sir.

338
00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:19.043
- Thanks.

339
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.163
For you. beautiful.

340
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.433
- That's sweet.
- Merry Christmas.

341
00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.330
- You know I can't.

342
00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.693
- Just once.

343
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:59.720
He'll never know.

344
00:27:09.735 --> 00:27:11.803
- It's beautiful.

345
00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.180
Who is it?

346
00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.013
- Room service.

347
00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:28.323
That was quick.

348
00:27:45.843 --> 00:27:47.343
- You can do this.

349
00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:03.913
Good morning. class.

350
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.210
First day of school.

351
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.093
First lesson.

352
00:28:09.783 --> 00:28:12.770
Oh. the tape stays on for now.

353
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:19.263
So. who knows anything
about the golden rule?

354
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.183
Anybody?

355
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:24.543
Philippe?

356
00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:27.800
No?

357
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.750
Okay. well. the golden rule
is a very old philosophy.

358
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.610
it dates back to Ancient Egypt.

359
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:39.610
From there. it spread through
the Middle East and to China.

360
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.633
and then to Europe.

361
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.840
Its roots are embedded
in every major religion

362
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:53.380
and it is the moral cornerstone
of civilized society.

363
00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:01.440
It is a very simple. but
profound master stroke

364
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.033
of reciprocal altruism.

365
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.147
Oh. yeah. I'm sorry.

366
00:29:08.147 --> 00:29:10.133
Are the big words going over your head?

367
00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:13.830
I'll put it like this.

368
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.193
What is hateful to you. do
not do onto your fellow man.

369
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.800
Well. I'm gonna take
an educated guess that

370
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.003
that young lady wasn't your wife.

371
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.573
I thought so.

372
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:43.763
You see that?

373
00:29:43.763 --> 00:29:47.889
That is an excellent example
of breaking the golden rule.

374
00:29:47.889 --> 00:29:50.735
Put yourself in my shoes.

375
00:29:50.735 --> 00:29:54.005
Imagine you're not married.

376
00:29:54.005 --> 00:29:56.994
It appears you wouldn't like it.

377
00:29:56.994 --> 00:29:58.685
It's very painful.

378
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.880
Guess what I found in there?

379
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.143
Your manners.

380
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.380
You were very rude to
me in the restaurant.

381
00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.760
I was trying to do you a
favor answering your phone.

382
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.130
Your wife. she was in a blind panic.

383
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.793
She'd called earlier. but no reply.

384
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:33.670
Why would you do that?

385
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.360
I mean. even if playing
away you could have at least

386
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.230
let her know you were safe.

387
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:40.910
And there I was trying to help.

388
00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.870
And all I get is abuse.

389
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.200
You know. I could've.

390
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.523
I could've told her
about the receptionist.

391
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:51.290
- Who the fuck are you?

392
00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.283
Where's Camille?

393
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.590
What are you doing?

394
00:31:06.315 --> 00:31:08.847
It's not here.

395
00:31:08.847 --> 00:31:11.370
- What the fuck are you talking about?

396
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:12.360
- Your manners.

397
00:31:14.614 --> 00:31:15.447
Hm.

398
00:31:17.797 --> 00:31:20.297
You know what else isn't here?

399
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.443
There's no wrappers.

400
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.944
Do you always fuck my
wife without a condom?

401
00:31:47.493 --> 00:31:49.493
No. no. no!

402
00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.680
- You see. I heard every word.

403
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.217
Connects to an app.

404
00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.423
Recorded it. too.

405
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.765
What do you think she'd say?

406
00:32:15.297 --> 00:32:18.983
All those messages. photos.

407
00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:29.173
Okay. so in a minute. I'm
gonna take off the tape.

408
00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.490
We need to have a chat.

409
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:36.620
If you make a noise...

410
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.760
Well. that's fine.

411
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.660
'Cause there's no one around. you see?

412
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.023
No conference.

413
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.640
All the rooms are booked for reasons

414
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.357
too numerous to enumerate.

415
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.503
That's Bacchus or
Dionysus if you're Greek.

416
00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.843
God of wine. sex. madness.

417
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:58.123
Torn apart by the wrath
of a jealous spouse.

418
00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.963
and later resurrected.

419
00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:07.570
A symbol of death and rebirth
and a pruning of the vines

420
00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:09.433
to encourage fresh growth.

421
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.513
Grapes for the harvest of new wine.

422
00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.830
You know. that's the exact
same look my students give me.

423
00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:30.613
All they care about is console games.

424
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.647
getting drunk. who fancies who.

425
00:34:39.424 --> 00:34:42.117
You know. to them. ethics are a meme.

426
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.233
It's a generation of
hashtag retweet morals.

427
00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:55.623
and celebrity is God.

428
00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.973
You know. I once knew a guy so vain.

429
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:12.980
he said he believed in the almighty 100%

430
00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.850
because he saw his face every morning

431
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:18.300
in the mirror when he shaved.

432
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.543
He died in a car crash.

433
00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:30.063
Hit a tree while taking a selfie.

434
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:43.483
- What do you want?

435
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.570
- That's a good question.

436
00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:53.020
- I don't want any trouble. okay?

437
00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:57.360
- When you fuck another man's wife.

438
00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.993
trouble's normally close behind.

439
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:02.630
- I'm sorry.

440
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.130
- Well. that's fine then. huh?

441
00:36:05.373 --> 00:36:07.020
Off you go. no harm done.

442
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.270
- I'll do anything you want.

443
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.930
Anything!

444
00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:15.420
Just don't tell my wife. please.

445
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.583
- Jesus Christ. well that
didn't take long. did it?

446
00:36:22.241 --> 00:36:23.760
Oh. don't worry. Philippe.

447
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.210
I'm not gonna tell your wife.

448
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.533
- Thank you.

449
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:34.430
- No. you will on this.

450
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:42.080
A full confession. then
it goes on your Facebook.

451
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.200
Instagram. Snapchat. all the
other shit you've got on here.

452
00:36:50.133 --> 00:36:51.430
You know. really. this could be the phone

453
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.220
of a 12 year old girl.

454
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.700
Just saying it could be.

455
00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.300
- That's not gonna happen. okay?

456
00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.023
I have money.

457
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:02.563
I can pay you whatever you want.

458
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.563
Let's make a deal. okay?

459
00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:07.690
- You mean like do business?

460
00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:08.523
- Yes.

461
00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.040
- I've got another idea.

462
00:37:16.094 --> 00:37:19.357
Either you confess or I make you confess-

463
00:37:21.503 --> 00:37:24.440
- 1.000 every month for life.

464
00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.820
- No. you're not listening to me.

465
00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.950
- 2.000 tax free. come on.

466
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:34.000
- I would not wipe my ass
with your money. okay?

467
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.113
I want a confession.

468
00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:37.533
- No.

469
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:40.103
- Philippe.

470
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:41.963
- Fuck you.

471
00:37:47.426 --> 00:37:50.300
Jesus. man. no. I'm sorry.

472
00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.740
I'm sorry. I won't touch her again.

473
00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:52.573
I promise.

474
00:37:52.573 --> 00:37:54.980
- You're just saying what
you think I wanna hear.

475
00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.433
It's a survival instinct.

476
00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:00.800
It's not sincere.

477
00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:08.263
You have to be sincere.

478
00:38:10.814 --> 00:38:12.414
And you have to make me believe.

479
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:24.313
- On my daughter's life. I'm sorry.

480
00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.600
You gotta believe me.

481
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:33.173
I know I've screwed up. but think of her.

482
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:37.023
You'll destroy everything she loves.

483
00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.333
Her family.
- And my family.

484
00:38:43.702 --> 00:38:45.452
Not a second thought?

485
00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:48.003
- Just let me go.

486
00:38:50.044 --> 00:38:51.470
And we'll say no more about it.

487
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:52.811
- Well. what is that. is that a threat?

488
00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:54.893
- No. no. no. no. it's not a threat.

489
00:38:57.312 --> 00:38:58.393
It's a assurance.

490
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.383
No police. no trouble.

491
00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.373
Just two guys coming to an arrangement.

492
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.093
Come on.

493
00:39:10.236 --> 00:39:11.069
What do you say?

494
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.330
It's Christmas.

495
00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:16.870
- Fuck Christmas.

496
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:17.780
Fuck Christmas.

497
00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:18.613
Fuck you. too.

498
00:39:18.613 --> 00:39:20.490
Is that all Chloe is to you?

499
00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.950
Just a shield against consequences.

500
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:27.130
- You said Chloe.

501
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.443
I never told you her name.

502
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:32.463
How do you know her name?

503
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.613
- That's a very good question.

504
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.700
That's two in five minutes.

505
00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.470
Fuck. you must be getting dizzy.

506
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:42.620
- How do you know my daughter's name?

507
00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:43.713
Tell me.
- No!

508
00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.970
Philippe. education has a structure.

509
00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:50.843
- If you've hurt my
daughter. I will kill you.

510
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:53.223
- Tell me what I want.

511
00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.483
Then. I'll answer question number two.

512
00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.873
- Revenge.

513
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.120
Not my style.

514
00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.770
- You want a confession.

515
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:07.603
Why?

516
00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:11.063
- You want me to suffer.

517
00:40:12.832 --> 00:40:13.932
- You must try harder.

518
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:18.863
- You want to post the confession online.

519
00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.153
and embarrass me.

520
00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.913
Humiliate me.

521
00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:30.913
- Please. don't think
of it as humiliation.

522
00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:35.263
Think of it as an education.

523
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.123
- My daughter. you promised.

524
00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.593
- I know Chloe.

525
00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.273
Hold that thought.
- Paul. Paul. Paul!

526
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.493
Is Chloe all right?

527
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.160
- Shut up.
- Just tell me.

528
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:39.960
- As if you'll confess
if I tell you she's fine.

529
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.400
- I will.

530
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.393
I promise.

531
00:41:43.713 --> 00:41:45.613
- And what do you know about promises?

532
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:58.023
Last chance.

533
00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:11.073
Confess or I send everything
on the phone to your wife.

534
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:19.143
- You get nothing until
I know Chloe's safe.

535
00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.100
- I've already got everything.

536
00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.683
I win either way.

537
00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:32.960
Just thought I'd give you a chance.

538
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.760
- A chance for what?

539
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.593
- Absolution.

540
00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:42.143
Confession's good for the soul.

541
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:45.133
If you have one.

542
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:55.583
Hm.

543
00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:03.363
- Paul. please. we can sort it out.

544
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:05.313
- Can we sort this?

545
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:10.123
- Don't do it.

546
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.883
She'll leave and take Chloe.

547
00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.433
- Sent.

548
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:25.013
Bye bye. Chloe.
- Jesus Christ.

549
00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:31.566
I'm sorry.

550
00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.353
- Don't feel ashamed.

551
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:39.343
This means you love.

552
00:43:41.694 --> 00:43:42.777
There's hope.

553
00:43:57.643 --> 00:44:02.143
"Give a strong drink unto
him that is ready to perish.

554
00:44:04.462 --> 00:44:06.967
and wine unto those that
be of heavy hearts."

555
00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.653
Proverbs.

556
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:27.950
So. let's talk about Camille.

557
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:37.130
Let's talk about what's been
snuffling between her legs.

558
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:47.090
A bloated bore with an
appetite for apples.

559
00:45:05.781 --> 00:45:08.031
I've been waiting for this.

560
00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:19.063
Funny thing is I was following
you expecting to see Camille.

561
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:25.170
Stupid mice get caught in traps.

562
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:26.453
Snap. snap. snap.

563
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:35.530
And now for the coup de grace.

564
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.963
She'd deny it to your face.

565
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:49.623
I thought I was losing her.

566
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:56.930
I could see the struggle.
until I showed her that.

567
00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:05.460
And now she knows the
truth that you are nothing

568
00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.953
but a filthy fucking pig.

569
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:19.593
Class dismissed.

570
00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:37.170
- Oh. I was about to forget.

571
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:39.430
I stopped by some friends.

572
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:40.480
I'm heading back now.

573
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:43.903
Doesn't matter who.

574
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.370
What are you. my mother?

575
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.643
Yeah. it was a joke. mom.

576
00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:56.910
All right. bye.

577
00:47:42.092 --> 00:47:43.009
- Philippe?

578
00:48:50.973 --> 00:48:51.806
- Hm?

579
00:48:53.732 --> 00:48:55.149
You want a drink?

580
00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:57.403
Wait your turn.

581
00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:13.670
- I want a cigarette.

582
00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:19.923
- Manners. remember?

583
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.173
- May I please have a cigarette?

584
00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:44.893
A light?

585
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:58.023
Sorry.

586
00:50:11.249 --> 00:50:13.120
Mother fucker!
- Oh!

587
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.503
- Is Chloe safe?

588
00:50:16.607 --> 00:50:19.440
Is she safe?
- Yes. yes. yes.

589
00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.340
- Where's Camille?

590
00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.159
Where's Camille?
- Room 12. room 12.

591
00:50:24.159 --> 00:50:26.143
Oh. fuck.

592
00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:30.576
Ah. ah!
- Come on!

593
00:50:43.016 --> 00:50:44.509
- Camille!

594
00:50:57.132 --> 00:50:58.542
- Susan. don't!

595
00:50:58.542 --> 00:51:00.959
That's enough. that's enough.

596
00:51:25.093 --> 00:51:26.503
- What do you think?

597
00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:32.440
I mean. it's not my usual
color. but then again.

598
00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:35.390
there's nothing really usual
about tonight at all is there?

599
00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:39.133
'Cause tonight I have a date.

600
00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.893
It's absurd. isn't it?

601
00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:49.700
I mean. why do we even bother really?

602
00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.340
The average man is not gonna
go to this much trouble.

603
00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:54.417
I can assure you.

604
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:59.290
But then again with a figure like yours.

605
00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.120
I guess you don't have
to try very hard. do you?

606
00:52:14.007 --> 00:52:16.757
You know. you and I have more
in common than you think.

607
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:22.673
I cheated on my ex-husband. too.

608
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:25.513
Had affairs.

609
00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:28.913
And then. I met Philippe.

610
00:52:35.045 --> 00:52:39.462
You know. we'd actually meet
here at this very motel.

611
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.253
It was our secret place.

612
00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:47.173
Our escape.

613
00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:50.760
Oh. I was such a bitch back then.

614
00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:54.030
Do you know what I mean?

615
00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:02.333
Anyway. I had no regrets.

616
00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:05.283
None.

617
00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.630
None whatsoever.

618
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:09.570
I know it's funny. isn't it?

619
00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:12.233
Because now you've
actually stolen him off me.

620
00:53:13.151 --> 00:53:17.403
but don't worry 'cause I
don't blame you entirely.

621
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.093
You glad you helped me
catch him now. Camille?

622
00:53:29.394 --> 00:53:30.311
Thought so.

623
00:54:14.208 --> 00:54:16.623
Jesus Christ.

624
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:21.050
Well. you know. if all else fails.

625
00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:23.433
you'll have a shining
career as a gynecologist.

626
00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:29.033
I would say they disgust me.

627
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:32.860
but in some ways when I think about it.

628
00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:35.613
I feel it's a bit of a turn on.

629
00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:39.380
I mean. what's wrong with me?

630
00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:42.820
I'm beautiful. aren't I?

631
00:54:46.234 --> 00:54:47.484
Of course I am.

632
00:54:50.333 --> 00:54:52.260
Oh. and just for the record.

633
00:54:53.131 --> 00:54:56.027
I heard everything by the way.

634
00:54:56.027 --> 00:54:59.870
All that talk of true
love and feeling safe.

635
00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:04.233
Philippe. you're God's gift to no one.

636
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.763
Dinner time.

637
00:55:20.865 --> 00:55:23.361
And don't you dare blame Paul.

638
00:55:23.361 --> 00:55:26.750
I've known about your
little affair now for weeks.

639
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:28.860
and there was no business convention.

640
00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:32.703
I charged every suite to your card.

641
00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:36.950
I wanted to make this date extra special.

642
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:38.920
Nobody here. but us.

643
00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:43.340
And as we both know. close
circuits here are a no-no.

644
00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.480
It's a hideaway for cheats.

645
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:49.937
And when it pays. well. why
put cameras in paradise. eh?

646
00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.870
Thank you. maitre d. can you
check on the food now. please?

647
00:55:59.080 --> 00:55:59.913
It's funny. isn't it?

648
00:55:59.913 --> 00:56:01.400
This morning when you left.

649
00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.663
I was still that innocent
little housewife.

650
00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:08.233
Mm. delicious.

651
00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:11.320
You know. you really should
try some of this. Philippe.

652
00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.720
It really. really is divine.

653
00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:14.873
Oh. yeah.

654
00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:21.213
Let me help you.

655
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.630
You're supposed to swallow. my darling.

656
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:35.730
I mean. that's what you've always told me.

657
00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:39.800
- Bitch. you won't get away with this.

658
00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:40.633
- Maybe not.

659
00:56:40.633 --> 00:56:44.700
After all. everything
we do has consequences.

660
00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:45.573
Even for you.

661
00:56:51.716 --> 00:56:53.860
- Consequences?

662
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:54.693
Like what?

663
00:56:54.693 --> 00:56:57.570
- For you. my love. a banquet.

664
00:56:57.570 --> 00:56:58.613
Oh. starters.

665
00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.190
And I've put something
a little extra special

666
00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:03.253
in there for you.

667
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:08.477
Oh. would you like mommy
to feed you instead?

668
00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:13.860
- You can shove that spoon

669
00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.620
and your date right up your ass.

670
00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:18.610
- Philippe. what do they
call a dish best served cold?

671
00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:19.453
- Revenge.

672
00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:22.520
Is that what this is all about?

673
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:27.210
You could have filed for divorce.

674
00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:30.083
Had the car. the house. everything.

675
00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:33.635
Instead you teamed up with this loser.

676
00:57:33.635 --> 00:57:37.573
- Oh. no. this is not
about a straight revenge.

677
00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.260
This is about making something perfect.

678
00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:46.060
I mean. that's what you always
like. isn't it. Philippe?

679
00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:48.567
You want everything to be perfect.

680
00:57:56.403 --> 00:57:58.217
Is this perfect enough for you?

681
00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:02.440
It's pretty good to me.

682
00:58:21.001 --> 00:58:22.430
Oh. you're clumsy.

683
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:23.263
Allow me.

684
00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:27.313
Oh. such a baby.

685
00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:31.610
Now. are we ready for our main course?

686
00:58:31.610 --> 00:58:32.443
Maitre d.

687
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:42.583
Perfection.

688
00:58:45.790 --> 00:58:49.160
I mean. tell me. is it the constant stream

689
00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.883
of altered images into your world?

690
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:59.010
You know. the body
beautiful. perfect breasts.

691
00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:00.333
unwrinkled brow.

692
00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:08.753
You have no idea what
it's like as a woman.

693
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:13.680
To be made to feel ashamed and fearful

694
00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.693
of growing old on a daily basis.

695
00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:21.817
Now. you look me in the eye

696
00:59:21.817 --> 00:59:23.737
and tell me it's the same for men.

697
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:28.633
- Maybe it is.
- Bullshit.

698
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:31.103
- Susan.

699
00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:36.943
Please listen.

700
00:59:38.134 --> 00:59:39.163
We can fix this.

701
00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:44.893
Let's go home. talk. whatever it takes.

702
00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:46.960
Let's save our family.

703
00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:55.130
- Hold that thought.

704
00:59:56.070 --> 00:59:57.243
Main course.

705
00:59:58.236 --> 00:59:59.069
Hm.

706
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:04.393
You know. in France. this
is known as a cassoulet.

707
01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:07.293
I made it myself.

708
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:12.730
Takes hours to prepare.
but like most things.

709
01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:16.202
when you put the time and
effort into it. it's perfect.

710
01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.746
- No.
- Open wide.

711
01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:29.142
- You don't like it?

712
01:00:29.142 --> 01:00:31.314
Well. I tried my very best.

713
01:00:31.314 --> 01:00:33.481
It's time for dessert now.

714
01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:41.543
Date's nearly over.

715
01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.143
You wanted to have your talk?

716
01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:51.150
So. what should we talk about then?

717
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:54.753
Weather. politics. TV?

718
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:59.683
- Chloe.

719
01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.353
- Oh. look.

720
01:01:08.396 --> 01:01:10.863
It's a tart. your favorite.

721
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:40.983
You know. they call this
the drink and forgetfulness.

722
01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.023
One sip and all this
becomes a distant memory.

723
01:01:49.957 --> 01:01:52.433
Are you ready to forgive
and forget now. Camille?

724
01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.763
We can make this whole thing all go away.

725
01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.530
Tell her what you told
me in the restaurant.

726
01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:08.363
Go on.

727
01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.673
Tell her how you want us to
start again and remain a family.

728
01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:19.400
Show her how you begged.

729
01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.253
Not so pretty now. is he?

730
01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:26.023
- You wanna continue with
this stupid charade. fine.

731
01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.830
Let her drink and then let her go.

732
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.163
- A toast then. to Absinthe friends.

733
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:02.103
- Do it.

734
01:03:10.694 --> 01:03:12.194
What is the point?

735
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.880
- Well. it was really
lovely to meet you. Camille.

736
01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:27.680
We should do it again sometime.

737
01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:40.933
- Camille. Camille.

738
01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.793
- Oh. and what's so funny?

739
01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:04.450
- That's it. it's over.

740
01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:06.560
- Oh God. baby.

741
01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:11.057
We are so far from over.

742
01:04:47.221 --> 01:04:52.221
Cheers.

743
01:05:08.394 --> 01:05:11.051
See what you made me do?

744
01:05:11.051 --> 01:05:14.218
Drove me into the arms of another man.

745
01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.723
- You're such a fucking hypocrite.

746
01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:24.700
How does your golden rule
theory sit with fucking my wife?

747
01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:25.903
- There's a difference.

748
01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.880
Bullshit.

749
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.583
- You broke a rule. not us.

750
01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.970
You wanna watch while I fuck your wife?

751
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:14.494
I could turn you to the wall if you want.

752
01:06:14.494 --> 01:06:18.970
- No. he can close his eyes if
he doesn't like what he sees.

753
01:07:25.821 --> 01:07:28.540
- You call that fucking?

754
01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:30.023
You fuck like an old man.

755
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:34.350
Go on then. Paul. fuck her hard.

756
01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.140
Cum on her and rub it all over.

757
01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:37.243
She loves that.

758
01:07:38.306 --> 01:07:41.550
You fucking old man.

759
01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:42.590
Is it even up?

760
01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:46.590
I'm surprised you're hard after the amount

761
01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:48.292
of booze you've knocked back.

762
01:07:48.292 --> 01:07:50.710
Think you can last all night?

763
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:55.710
No chance. you weak fuck!

764
01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.718
- Oh!

765
01:08:03.504 --> 01:08:05.423
- Oh God. he's really good. Philippe.

766
01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:09.638
But this could get a hell of a lot better.

767
01:08:09.638 --> 01:08:11.950
Yeah. keep talking dirty to me.

768
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:12.783
Go on.

769
01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.910
Make me really. really wet for him.

770
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:19.173
- Bitch. you disgust me.

771
01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:22.020
Your pussy stinks.

772
01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.663
I hated going down on you.

773
01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:26.933
I can't believe Chloe came from that.

774
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:31.373
How can someone so beautiful
come from that sick cunt?

775
01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:34.813
You whore!

776
01:08:35.656 --> 01:08:36.656
- You know. Philippe...

777
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:39.271
Your wife's a really good fuck.

778
01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.360
Men would die to fuck a woman like this.

779
01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:49.477
- Say I love you.

780
01:08:50.485 --> 01:08:51.568
- I love you.

781
01:08:52.410 --> 01:08:56.480
- Keep saying it.
- I love you. I love you.

782
01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.745
- Don't stop.
- I love you. I love you.

783
01:09:00.745 --> 01:09:04.194
I love you. oh!

784
01:09:36.422 --> 01:09:39.670
You know. I think he liked that.

785
01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:41.163
- He didn't close his eyes.

786
01:09:44.663 --> 01:09:47.280
Did that make you hard?

787
01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.243
Did Paul fucking me turn you on?

788
01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.887
- Or maybe you just like watching me.

789
01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:00.773
No. nothing?

790
01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:04.533
Did you peek at sick cunt?

791
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:09.113
Verses to rival Blake.

792
01:10:12.693 --> 01:10:14.743
- I don't think Philippe likes poetry.

793
01:10:20.017 --> 01:10:25.017
- "Cruelty has a human heart
and jealousy a human face.

794
01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:31.393
Terror. the human form divine.

795
01:10:33.807 --> 01:10:36.163
And Secrecy. the human dress.

796
01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.053
The human dress. is forged iron.

797
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:44.773
The human form. a fiery forge.

798
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:51.233
The human face. a furnace sealed.

799
01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.557
The human heart. its hungry gorge."

800
01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:14.105
- "For mercy has a human heart.

801
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:20.623
Pity. a human face.

802
01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:27.713
Love. the human form divine.

803
01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.837
And peace. the human dress."

804
01:11:39.087 --> 01:11:39.920
Chloe.

805
01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:14.580
- Share and share alike.

806
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:06.623
Still here?
- Yes.

807
01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:10.053
- Why?

808
01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:13.823
- Enjoy yourself?

809
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:21.353
- Yeah. well. now you
know what it feels like.

810
01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:29.350
- Do you feel the guilt?

811
01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:32.343
I always felt guilty.

812
01:13:37.221 --> 01:13:39.471
- I don't know what I feel.

813
01:13:42.807 --> 01:13:45.353
I just wanted to hurt him and you.

814
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:52.593
- Mission accomplished.

815
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:57.383
Feel better?

816
01:13:58.451 --> 01:14:01.583
- A little. yeah.

817
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.303
I hate myself.

818
01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.863
But I hate him a little less.

819
01:14:17.327 --> 01:14:19.833
It's like a stone's been
lifted off my heart.

820
01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:32.683
- Let's go home.

821
01:14:35.391 --> 01:14:36.724
- And then what?

822
01:14:39.507 --> 01:14:41.590
I don't know.

823
01:15:00.947 --> 01:15:02.773
- You're gonna have to let me go soon.

824
01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.400
The cleaners start doing
the rounds at 7:00.

825
01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:12.480
Come on.

826
01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.310
We're done playing games.

827
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:15.203
Untie me.

828
01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:17.956
- You never complained about it before.

829
01:15:17.956 --> 01:15:19.720
- God damn it. Susan.

830
01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:20.613
Let me go.

831
01:15:28.216 --> 01:15:30.320
- You know. babe. I doubt she'd

832
01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.390
had gone to all this trouble for you.

833
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:35.775
- What do you mean?

834
01:15:35.775 --> 01:15:36.608
- Camille.

835
01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:40.103
She was so quick to leave.

836
01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.353
Wasn't she?

837
01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:49.167
Not even a "goodbye. Philippe."

838
01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:55.673
Now. she's gone.

839
01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.053
Forgotten.

840
01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:06.643
Revenge is the best measure of love.

841
01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.113
Paul was such a pretentious bastard.

842
01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.587
Good fuck though.

843
01:16:42.525 --> 01:16:44.358
Almost as good as you.

844
01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:50.993
Why?
- Why what?

845
01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.940
Cheat on me.

846
01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.270
- The same reason we cheated.

847
01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:04.000
The passion. the excitement. the chase-

848
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:04.973
- And the romance?

849
01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:11.450
So. all of this was just-
- Was me.

850
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:14.323
It was all about my pride and my ego.

851
01:17:16.290 --> 01:17:17.393
I am the guilty one.

852
01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.130
I made the first move.

853
01:17:20.130 --> 01:17:22.350
I chased her into bed.

854
01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:23.870
That's what you wanna hear. right?

855
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:24.883
My confession.

856
01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:32.083
Help me make it right.

857
01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.143
- Well. Chloe needs her parents.

858
01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.403
- She needs both of us.

859
01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:46.790
- We all make mistakes from
time to time don't we. hm?

860
01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:51.850
- We're a family. we can get through this.

861
01:17:51.850 --> 01:17:52.683
- Maybe.

862
01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:55.720
People have come back
from much worse than this.

863
01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:56.553
I know that.

864
01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:07.743
Unfortunately. I don't see that happening.

865
01:18:10.196 --> 01:18:11.653
- What do you mean?

866
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.413
- Oh. Philippe.

867
01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:20.280
I am so happy for you that
you've had your little insight.

868
01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:25.833
But your family's not a bad
deal in need of a fix here.

869
01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:27.853
- Fine.

870
01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.353
Divorce me.

871
01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.033
Take it all.

872
01:18:33.150 --> 01:18:35.580
I don't care about that shit anymore.

873
01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.740
All I care about is Chloe.

874
01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:39.720
So. let's come to some arrangement.

875
01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:42.910
- Jesus Christ.
- It doesn't have to be toxic.

876
01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:44.843
- I think we're past toxic. dear.

877
01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:47.920
- Don't punish her for my sins.

878
01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:50.890
- Don't you dare believe
that you're a martyr.

879
01:18:50.890 --> 01:18:53.360
Not for one fucking second.

880
01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.883
Now. you listen to me.

881
01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:58.943
What happens here happens
and for good reason.

882
01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:10.477
You are pathetic.

883
01:19:16.997 --> 01:19:19.303
- Add weak and childish to the list.

884
01:19:20.190 --> 01:19:23.580
Vain. arrogant. self obsessed.

885
01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:24.620
A martyr?

886
01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:25.453
No.

887
01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:33.543
I see what's important and
it's not me. it's Chloe.

888
01:19:47.382 --> 01:19:51.637
- You're never gonna
see your daughter again.

889
01:19:51.637 --> 01:19:55.260
- No. no!

890
01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:57.864
For Christ's sake. why?

891
01:19:57.864 --> 01:20:00.031
You selfish fucking bitch.

892
01:20:01.023 --> 01:20:04.153
Is all this really more
important than Chloe?

893
01:20:09.993 --> 01:20:14.993
- When we first got hitched.
pretty much the first weekend.

894
01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:22.097
Remember how good the sex was?

895
01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:37.223
I was already six weeks late. Philippe.

896
01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:41.360
Already pregnant.

897
01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.967
So. you see. you can't have Chloe.

898
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:53.593
She's not even yours.

899
01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:57.100
- You're lying.

900
01:20:59.690 --> 01:21:01.793
- Why would I lie about my own daughter?

901
01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:08.903
She's everything to me.

902
01:21:12.262 --> 01:21:13.095
Not you.

903
01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:21.093
- You fucking bitch.

904
01:21:24.610 --> 01:21:26.610
You've been lying to me all these years?

905
01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:33.360
- Well. a girl has to
take care of herself.

906
01:21:48.685 --> 01:21:49.518
- Shit.

907
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.260
Philippe. it's Nina.

908
01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:10.243
Rise and shine.

909
01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:15.840
I'm sorry it's late.

910
01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.090
Here's your wake-up call.

911
01:22:23.451 --> 01:22:24.284
Hello?

912
01:23:09.455 --> 01:23:10.288
Philippe?

913
01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.980
- You'll both go to jail for this.

914
01:23:46.877 --> 01:23:47.710
- Here.

915
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:58.353
Might as well give it a go.

916
01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:22.283
- Fuck you. I'll never forget this.

917
01:24:32.412 --> 01:24:34.995
- So. there is no happy ending.

918
01:24:38.354 --> 01:24:40.790
No forgive and forget.

919
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:49.387
- The way I see it.
you've got two options.

920
01:24:53.695 --> 01:24:56.112
You kill me or you let me go.

921
01:24:59.723 --> 01:25:02.963
If you let me go. I press charges.

922
01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:09.193
If you kill me. you go on the run.

923
01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.660
Either way you lose Chloe.

924
01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.083
You're willing to risk that?

925
01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.240
Revenge is the best measure of love.

926
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:40.167
It's your choice.

927
01:25:47.329 --> 01:25:51.329
- Actually. I've just
thought of a third option.
