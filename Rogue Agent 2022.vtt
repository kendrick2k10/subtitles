it's… it's my job. you know?

359
00:23:01.208 --> 00:23:02.375
[Alice sighs]

360
00:23:02.458 --> 00:23:05.625
Well. thank you for dinner.
That was really… really lovely.

361
00:23:05.708 --> 00:23:07.208
Oh-- Yeah. yeah. well…

362
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.542
-Uh…
-And sorry again about last night.

363
00:23:10.625 --> 00:23:12.875
No. it's-- it's fine. honestly.

364
00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:14.542
Uh… uh…

365
00:23:14.625 --> 00:23:15.833
Oh. Um…

366
00:23:16.542 --> 00:23:18.583
Uh. I hope your dad recovers quickly.

367
00:23:19.625 --> 00:23:20.958
Yeah. Thank you.

368
00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:23.917
-[clock chiming]
-Um…

369
00:23:28.208 --> 00:23:30.375
Oh. yeah. [chuckles]

370
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.708
Take care. Alice.

371
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.125
What the fuck?

372
00:23:50.208 --> 00:23:51.417
[phone ringing]

373
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.417
[knocking at door]
[door opens]

374
00:23:54.208 --> 00:23:57.000
The file on the latest
Jeremy Ascott litigation.

375
00:23:57.083 --> 00:23:58.208
[mobile phone rings]

376
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.917
[mouths]

377
00:24:09.333 --> 00:24:10.250
Hello.

378
00:24:10.917 --> 00:24:12.542
[Robert] <i>What are you doing now?</i>

379
00:24:12.625 --> 00:24:13.750
What. <i>now</i> now?

380
00:24:14.417 --> 00:24:15.833
I'm working. [laughs]

381
00:24:15.917 --> 00:24:17.625
<i>I'd like to show you something.</i>

382
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.083
-What?
<i>-It's a surprise.</i>

383
00:24:22.375 --> 00:24:24.625
-[Alice] Where are we going?
-[Robert] Be patient.

384
00:24:24.708 --> 00:24:27.875
-[Alice] Is this it?
-[Robert] So full of questions. Trust me!

385
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.167
-Two. please.
-All right. Ten pounds.

386
00:24:32.583 --> 00:24:33.583
-Thank you.
-What is this?

387
00:24:33.667 --> 00:24:35.083
-Thank you.
-Come on.

388
00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:37.208
Come on.

389
00:24:39.042 --> 00:24:40.167
-Uh--
-Oh.

390
00:24:40.667 --> 00:24:42.417
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

391
00:24:45.583 --> 00:24:47.583
[resonant chiming]

392
00:24:52.417 --> 00:24:53.667
[Alice] What is it?

393
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.708
[Robert] It's called <i>Longplayer.</i>

394
00:24:58.083 --> 00:24:59.708
These are Tibetan music bowls.

395
00:25:00.333 --> 00:25:03.125
They're playing a composition
that lasts for 1.000 years

396
00:25:03.208 --> 00:25:05.000
without ever repeating itself.

397
00:25:06.583 --> 00:25:08.375
It's controlled by a computer.

398
00:25:09.208 --> 00:25:11.375
and it never. ever stops.

399
00:25:12.833 --> 00:25:14.083
The plan is…

400
00:25:15.625 --> 00:25:18.792
to just let it keep playing
without stopping.

401
00:25:20.417 --> 00:25:22.750
Maybe. hopefully. for a thousand years.

402
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.792
You are…

403
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.375
so fucking random. [laughs]

404
00:25:31.875 --> 00:25:33.042
Do you not like it?

405
00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:36.167
I do like it.

406
00:25:38.125 --> 00:25:40.083
I've never seen anything like it.

407
00:25:45.083 --> 00:25:46.167
[laughs]

408
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.208
[chuckles]

409
00:25:50.333 --> 00:25:51.500
Listen to that.

410
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.125
[Alice laughs]

411
00:25:54.208 --> 00:25:55.667
Hey. come with me.

412
00:25:56.792 --> 00:25:58.208
Okay. [laughs]

413
00:25:58.292 --> 00:25:59.792
-Seriously. come on.
-All right.

414
00:26:05.708 --> 00:26:07.167
I love lighthouses.

415
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.250
[gulls calling]

416
00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:09.583
[both chuckle]

417
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
[distant alarm bell ringing]

418
00:26:17.417 --> 00:26:19.208
[laughs] Wow.

419
00:26:22.083 --> 00:26:23.583
-[Robert] Yeah.
-[gasps]

420
00:26:23.667 --> 00:26:27.000
This lighthouse was here
way before any of those skyscrapers were.

421
00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:31.000
and it'll probably be here
long after they're gone.

422
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:33.708
You think so?

423
00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:38.000
Yeah. I hope so.

424
00:26:54.083 --> 00:26:55.167
[Alice giggles]

425
00:27:04.375 --> 00:27:05.542
[laughs]

426
00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:35.125
[shower running]

427
00:27:35.208 --> 00:27:36.583
[sighs]

428
00:27:40.708 --> 00:27:42.417
[phone vibrating]

429
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.750
Sophie?

430
00:27:51.583 --> 00:27:52.917
[door opens]

431
00:27:59.208 --> 00:28:00.208
[Robert] Okay.

432
00:28:01.875 --> 00:28:03.750
Right. I'm really sorry. I gotta go.

433
00:28:04.417 --> 00:28:06.458
-[sighs]
-[phone vibrating]

434
00:28:09.417 --> 00:28:10.333
Uh. it's my dad.

435
00:28:11.542 --> 00:28:12.792
I'll call you tomorrow. okay?

436
00:28:12.875 --> 00:28:14.250
-Great.
-Great.

437
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
[Robert] Oh!

438
00:28:18.958 --> 00:28:20.958
[running downstairs]

439
00:28:25.958 --> 00:28:27.292
[man] Just a standard check?

440
00:28:27.917 --> 00:28:29.708
Credit histories. mortgages.

441
00:28:29.792 --> 00:28:31.167
and spouses?

442
00:28:33.583 --> 00:28:35.792
-Thank you.
-I'll be in touch.

443
00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:46.792
[clattering]

444
00:29:51.333 --> 00:29:52.208
[gasps]

445
00:29:52.292 --> 00:29:54.042
-[sighs]
-Hello. Sophie.

446
00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:55.250
Rob.

447
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:56.875
Supply run.

448
00:29:58.958 --> 00:30:00.042
How's it going?

449
00:30:00.833 --> 00:30:02.417
Oh. well. um…

450
00:30:03.583 --> 00:30:06.292
I have the guest logs
for the last two weeks.

451
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.000
I can't find a pattern.

452
00:30:18.875 --> 00:30:20.667
Nothing's standing out to me.

453
00:30:23.917 --> 00:30:25.875
I'll get the analysts to take a look.

454
00:30:30.042 --> 00:30:30.875
Well done.

455
00:30:33.292 --> 00:30:36.750
Oh. I got you some. uh… some proper grub.

456
00:30:38.625 --> 00:30:39.833
Spaghetti

457
00:30:41.375 --> 00:30:42.333
and…

458
00:30:43.417 --> 00:30:44.417
bolognese.

459
00:30:47.292 --> 00:30:48.292
Thank you.

460
00:30:49.625 --> 00:30:51.500
No credit history at all?

461
00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:53.542
[man] <i>Nothing.</i>
<i>And no marriage certificate.</i>

462
00:30:55.167 --> 00:30:58.125
<i>In terms of public records.</i>
<i>Robert Hansen is a ghost.</i>

463
00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:00.958
And what does that tell you?

464
00:31:01.833 --> 00:31:02.833
<i>Nothing good.</i>

465
00:31:04.792 --> 00:31:06.875
Okay. Thank you.

466
00:31:06.958 --> 00:31:08.042
[bell rings]

467
00:31:10.167 --> 00:31:11.708
Ooh. I think this is us.

468
00:31:12.208 --> 00:31:13.167
Great.

469
00:31:13.667 --> 00:31:17.083
How was work? I didn't see you
when I passed this morning.

470
00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:18.167
Thank you.

471
00:31:20.625 --> 00:31:21.625
Thanks.

472
00:31:22.292 --> 00:31:23.625
Um…

473
00:31:23.708 --> 00:31:27.333
Work… Uh. yeah.
I guess I was on a-- on a test drive.

474
00:31:29.417 --> 00:31:31.375
-Sell many cars?
-Two.

475
00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:34.583
Not a bad day at the office.

476
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.500
How about you?

477
00:31:40.375 --> 00:31:41.375
The usual.

478
00:31:51.083 --> 00:31:52.292
How's your dad?

479
00:31:55.417 --> 00:31:57.083
He's better. thank you. Yeah.

480
00:31:57.583 --> 00:32:00.333
He. um… he came home. which is great.
Such a relief.

481
00:32:01.625 --> 00:32:02.625
Yeah.

482
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.125
[chuckles]

483
00:32:14.375 --> 00:32:15.458
Everything all right?

484
00:32:17.417 --> 00:32:18.625
Everything's great.

485
00:32:23.542 --> 00:32:24.542
Give me a chip.

486
00:32:25.625 --> 00:32:27.125
-One. No more.
-[laughs]

487
00:32:32.875 --> 00:32:34.542
[distant sirens wailing]

488
00:32:40.333 --> 00:32:41.833
You're not sure about me.

489
00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:43.583
What?

490
00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:46.250
You have reservations.

491
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.500
Questions.

492
00:32:51.042 --> 00:32:52.375
I had you checked out.

493
00:32:53.958 --> 00:32:54.958
You did what?

494
00:32:55.042 --> 00:32:57.083
You know I'm a litigation solicitor.

495
00:32:57.875 --> 00:33:00.375
We have people
who do client checks for us.

496
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.167
Credit history. That sort of thing.

497
00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.542
Sorry. you put
a private investigator onto me?

498
00:33:08.625 --> 00:33:10.042
Yes. I did.

499
00:33:10.625 --> 00:33:12.958
And as far as he can see. you don't exist.

500
00:33:15.208 --> 00:33:16.583
-Right.
-Yeah.

501
00:33:18.417 --> 00:33:20.500
-Impressive.
-Yeah. isn't it?

502
00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:24.667
Well…

503
00:33:25.708 --> 00:33:26.708
technically.

504
00:33:28.333 --> 00:33:29.417
that's right.

505
00:33:30.167 --> 00:33:31.083
I don't exist.

506
00:33:32.958 --> 00:33:36.583
Or rather. the name that
you have been searching for doesn't exist.

507
00:33:39.333 --> 00:33:43.042
Alice. Robert Hansen is an alias.

508
00:33:44.625 --> 00:33:46.750
My real name is Robert Freegard.

509
00:33:48.583 --> 00:33:50.542
-Alice. wait.
-Get the fuck off me.

510
00:33:50.625 --> 00:33:52.125
Wait. Jesus. give me a second.

511
00:33:52.208 --> 00:33:55.083
-You're married. aren't you?
-No. I'm not married.

512
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.500
-[sighs]
-Alice. please.

513
00:33:58.458 --> 00:33:59.667
[Alice sighs]

514
00:34:02.292 --> 00:34:03.333
[sighs]

515
00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:08.667
I am an officer
in the British security services.

516
00:34:10.083 --> 00:34:11.083
MI5.

517
00:34:17.917 --> 00:34:21.125
-You work in a car showroom.
-That's my cover right now.

518
00:34:21.208 --> 00:34:25.250
-I can't tell you any more than that.
-[laughs] What? Come on.

519
00:34:25.917 --> 00:34:27.667
No. I'm sorry. no. Bullshit.

520
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:30.250
-It's the truth.
-Well. then. who's Sophie?

521
00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:34.625
How do you know about her?

522
00:34:35.125 --> 00:34:37.625
She rang your phone
when you were in the shower.

523
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.250
She works with me.

524
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.833
I supervise her on a job.

525
00:34:45.542 --> 00:34:49.792
She's undercover as well. like me. okay?
We're on the same investigation.

526
00:34:51.042 --> 00:34:54.042
Alice. listen. I know this is a shock.
but it's the truth.

527
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.833
I-- [sighs] I just…

528
00:35:00.667 --> 00:35:01.500
A spy?

529
00:35:03.125 --> 00:35:04.458
[chuckles softly]

530
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.417
No. You-- you told me…
You said that you could never kill anyone.

531
00:35:11.458 --> 00:35:13.333
[chuckles] I don't think I could.

532
00:35:14.333 --> 00:35:16.458
I-- I never have. either.

533
00:35:20.542 --> 00:35:24.125
-Do you have a gun?
-No. it's not like the movies.

534
00:35:26.792 --> 00:35:28.083
[scoffs]

535
00:35:30.833 --> 00:35:35.417
Listen. now that I've told you all this.
I have to let my superiors know. okay?

536
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.917
Means you're gonna be vetted.

537
00:35:37.583 --> 00:35:38.458
Vetted?

538
00:35:38.542 --> 00:35:41.917
It just means they're gonna do

00:43:59.292 --> 00:44:02.500
-[gasps] Oh my God.
-Your days of being a freelancer are over.

710
00:44:02.583 --> 00:44:03.667
[laughs]

711
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.792
Now. listen.
It doesn't start for a little while.

712
00:44:07.875 --> 00:44:09.917
I'll find you
somewhere to stay until then.

713
00:44:11.208 --> 00:44:12.833
-[sighs] It is happening.
-[sobbing]

714
00:44:16.833 --> 00:44:18.417
Hey. Come on.

715
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.958
[sniffles] Sorry.

716
00:44:21.708 --> 00:44:23.208
Congratulations. Sophie.

717
00:44:23.917 --> 00:44:26.458
-Nobody deserves this more than you.
-[laughs]

718
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.125
[both laughing]

719
00:44:29.208 --> 00:44:30.792
[gasps] Oh my God.

720
00:44:31.875 --> 00:44:33.125
Come on. Let's go.

721
00:44:33.208 --> 00:44:34.917
-[kids yelling]
-[whistle blows]

722
00:44:36.958 --> 00:44:38.958
[distant siren wailing]

723
00:44:43.458 --> 00:44:46.417
-I didn't wanna talk over the phone.
-Okay.

724
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.875
This guy you asked me
to check out. the ghost.

725
00:44:50.542 --> 00:44:52.667
Oh. yeah. No. that's all been resolved.

726
00:44:53.542 --> 00:44:56.125
Oh. Well. I managed to do
a little bit more digging.

727
00:45:00.417 --> 00:45:01.458
Go on.

728
00:45:02.333 --> 00:45:05.792
So. we know Robert Hansen
doesn't exist. not officially.

729
00:45:05.875 --> 00:45:07.583
But I did find. in the court records.

730
00:45:07.667 --> 00:45:11.125
a couple of minor judgments
against a Robert Hansen-Freegard.

731
00:45:12.125 --> 00:45:14.458
Nothing serious. mind you. but. well.

732
00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:18.250
I like to do a thorough job.
so I ran all the iterations.

733
00:45:18.333 --> 00:45:19.250
Robert Hansen.

734
00:45:20.292 --> 00:45:23.958
Robert Hansen-Freegard.
and Robert Freegard.

735
00:45:25.208 --> 00:45:26.375
Court documents?

736
00:45:26.958 --> 00:45:28.542
Sealed court documents. no less.

737
00:45:29.042 --> 00:45:31.625
They're relating to someone
called Robert Freegard.

738
00:45:31.708 --> 00:45:34.125
Date of birth. May 21st. 1967.

739
00:45:35.333 --> 00:45:37.750
1991. he had a brush with the court.

740
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.833
Up in front of a judge. on the receiving
end of a non-molestation order.

741
00:45:42.208 --> 00:45:44.875
A few years later.
he successfully had that set aside.

742
00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:46.708
Or somebody did.

743
00:45:47.333 --> 00:45:48.833
Wh-- what was it about?

744
00:45:49.458 --> 00:45:52.833
The allegation was for stalking
and harassment of a young woman.

745
00:45:52.917 --> 00:45:56.542
Julie Harper. Wouldn't leave her alone.
Made her life hell. it seems.

746
00:45:56.625 --> 00:45:59.375
I couldn't find the girl.
but I managed to get a phone number

747
00:45:59.458 --> 00:46:02.375
for a Bridget Harper.
who I'm pretty sure is her mother.

748
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.167
Anything else?

749
00:46:06.875 --> 00:46:07.875
No.

750
00:46:08.958 --> 00:46:09.958
No. thank you.

751
00:46:20.708 --> 00:46:21.583
[sighs]

752
00:46:29.625 --> 00:46:31.208
[Robert sighs]

753
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:34.625
-How was work?
-Good. Good

754
00:46:38.833 --> 00:46:40.000
Is everything okay?

755
00:46:40.667 --> 00:46:41.667
Great.

756
00:46:43.542 --> 00:46:44.583
[Robert chuckles]

757
00:46:47.208 --> 00:46:49.417
Have you heard from my employers yet?

758
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.917
-Your employers?
-Yeah.

759
00:46:52.792 --> 00:46:55.292
They haven't tried
to shit-test you. have they?

760
00:46:55.792 --> 00:46:56.958
"Shit-test"?

761
00:46:57.042 --> 00:47:00.000
Throw some crap at you.
Something unexpected.

762
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:01.583
See if it sticks.

763
00:47:02.458 --> 00:47:04.750
It helps them draw up
a psych profile of you.

764
00:47:05.375 --> 00:47:06.708
What do you mean. throw some crap?

765
00:47:06.792 --> 00:47:08.625
Pfft. I don't know.
They can be pretty creative.

766
00:47:09.333 --> 00:47:13.125
They don't always do it.
so. uh… forget I said anything.

767
00:47:13.208 --> 00:47:16.375
No. um… I mean. what-- what kind of crap?

768
00:47:17.708 --> 00:47:19.083
Um… [sighs]

769
00:47:19.167 --> 00:47:20.750
I don't know. Some bullshit about me.

770
00:47:21.333 --> 00:47:24.583
Something to throw you off guard.
Test your loyalty to me.

771
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:28.958
[laughs] Honestly.
they probably won't do it.

772
00:47:29.042 --> 00:47:32.458
And even if they did.
I know that you would handle it perfectly.

773
00:47:32.542 --> 00:47:34.958
so forget I said it.

774
00:47:36.917 --> 00:47:38.667
Ready. Here we go.

775
00:47:40.292 --> 00:47:41.125
[chuckles]

776
00:47:41.208 --> 00:47:43.000
-Try this.
-Mmm!

777
00:47:45.958 --> 00:47:48.375
There was actually one more thing
I wanted to say to you.

778
00:47:48.875 --> 00:47:51.250
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Um…

779
00:47:52.333 --> 00:47:53.292
[tuts]

780
00:47:53.792 --> 00:47:54.792
[sighs]

781
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.500
I love you.

782
00:48:03.542 --> 00:48:04.667
Right. let's eat.

783
00:48:06.375 --> 00:48:10.000
[sighs]This is the best bolognese
that you have ever eaten.

784
00:48:10.083 --> 00:48:11.250
I promise you that.

785
00:48:14.917 --> 00:48:15.792
Mmm.

786
00:48:21.167 --> 00:48:22.458
[sighs]

787
00:48:27.917 --> 00:48:29.083
Uh

788
00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:40.208
[sighs]

789
00:48:41.083 --> 00:48:42.583
Okay. then. Shit-test me.

790
00:48:42.667 --> 00:48:44.500
-[dialing]
-[sighs]

791
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:51.292
[ringing tone]

792
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.542
-[woman] <i>Hello?</i>
-Hello. Mrs. Harper?

793
00:48:55.625 --> 00:48:57.417
<i>That's right. How can I help you?</i>

794
00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.542
Hi. uh. my name's Alice Archer.

795
00:49:00.125 --> 00:49:01.625
I'm sorry to bother you. Uh--

796
00:49:02.125 --> 00:49:05.208
I need to talk to you
about someone your daughter used to know.

797
00:49:06.417 --> 00:49:08.208
His name is Robert Freegard.

798
00:49:08.875 --> 00:49:10.333
[Bridget gasps]

799
00:49:13.625 --> 00:49:14.958
Mrs. Harper?

800
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.250
Hey. babe.

801
00:49:22.042 --> 00:49:24.542
Ooh. you look incredible. [groans]

802
00:49:26.333 --> 00:49:27.458
This is nice.

803
00:49:28.833 --> 00:49:31.333
I was speaking to someone
that used to know you today.

804
00:49:31.833 --> 00:49:34.333
She told me the most extraordinary story.

805
00:49:35.708 --> 00:49:36.583
Oh?

806
00:49:36.667 --> 00:49:37.792
Bridget Harper.

807
00:49:37.875 --> 00:49:39.583
Mother of Julie Harper?

808
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.125
She told me that. years ago.
you and Julie had a whirlwind romance.

809
00:49:45.875 --> 00:49:49.667
She borrowed 20 grand off her parents
to get married. but it never happened.

810
00:49:50.917 --> 00:49:51.917
[chuckles]

811
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.708
-I did tell you this was gonna happen.
-Oh. fuck off.

812
00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.292
There was a court case. You harassed her.

813
00:50:00.292 --> 00:50:03.375
-Are you telling me this is all made up?
-Not all of it. no.

814
00:50:04.083 --> 00:50:05.125
Ahem…

815
00:50:06.375 --> 00:50:08.375
[laughs]

816
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.458
Julie was my first girlfriend.

817
00:50:13.667 --> 00:50:15.958
Thought I loved her.
Maybe I did. I don't know.

818
00:50:17.333 --> 00:50:19.833
Uh… She drank. a lot.

819
00:50:20.333 --> 00:50:23.500
At first. I excused it.
thought it was normal. but it wasn't.

820
00:50:24.667 --> 00:50:27.625
She was. uh… she was an alcoholic. It was…

821
00:50:29.583 --> 00:50:32.708
It was horrible. She's actually
the reason I gave up drinking.

822
00:50:34.583 --> 00:50:36.792
Eventually. I persuaded her
to go into rehab.

823
00:50:36.875 --> 00:50:39.917
We found a place.
It was private. expensive.

824
00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:45.167
She borrowed the money off her parents.
but she never told them why she needed it.

825
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.833
Then the night before she was meant to go.
she just disappeared.

826
00:50:49.917 --> 00:50:52.667
I guess she really didn't want
to give up drinking.

827
00:50:53.958 --> 00:50:55.792
I tried to find her. of course I did.

828
00:50:56.583 --> 00:50:57.542
And yeah.

829
00:50:58.792 --> 00:51:01.208
Yeah. she complained to the police
to keep me away.

830
00:51:02.167 --> 00:51:03.542
I went to court.

831
00:51:03.625 --> 00:51:06.583
Judge threw it out
in about five minutes flat.

832
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.750
This came out in my clearance interviews
when I applied for the service.

833
00:51:12.833 --> 00:51:14.042
That's why it's coming up.

834
00:51:14.125 --> 00:51:16.292
They use this
when they do this kind of thing.

835
00:51:16.375 --> 00:51:19.208
-But the woman I spoke to--
-Is Bridget. and. yes. she's real.

836
00:51:19.292 --> 00:51:23.000
This is what she really thinks.
I can't change her mind. No one will.

837
00:51:23.583 --> 00:51:26.833
Oh. and by the way. the person
who gave you all this information?

838
00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:30.125
They're working for us.
I imagine. as a freelancer.

839
00:51:31.667 --> 00:51:32.667
But why?

840
00:51:33.708 --> 00:51:37.417
-I mean. why?
-To see if you'll trust me in a crisis.

841
00:51:42.458 --> 00:51:43.292
[sighs]
[chuckles]

842
00:51:47.625 --> 00:51:48.875
Where are you going?

843
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:54.125
Uh. I'm gonna work out
if I wanna spend the rest of my life

844
00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:58.958
with someone whose job has turned them
into a cynical. entitled bitch.

845
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.000
[phone rings]

846
00:52:20.125 --> 00:52:21.167
Hello?

847
00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:23.542
[man] <i>Hello. Is this Alice Archer?</i>

848
00:52:24.375 --> 00:52:25.375
Yes.

849
00:52:26.417 --> 00:52:29.500
<i>I'm sorry to bother you. but I was given</i>
<i>your number earlier today</i>

850
00:52:29.583 --> 00:52:30.708
<i>by Bridget Harper.</i>

851
00:52:32.208 --> 00:52:35.000
<i>I'm calling</i>
<i>in relation to Robert Freegard.</i>

852
00:52:35.667 --> 00:52:36.667
Who is this?

853
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:38.750
<i>My name is Paul Jones.</i>

854
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:41.208
<i>Robert Freegard has…</i>

855
00:52:41.833 --> 00:52:45.500
<i>well. he has kidnapped</i>
<i>my daughter. Sophie.</i>

856
00:52:45.583 --> 00:52:48.000
I'm sorry. but you need to stop this now.

857
00:52:48.583 --> 00:52:53.333
This is an infringement of my privacy
and that of my partner. This is obscene.

858
00:52:58.167 --> 00:52:59.167
[sighs]

859
00:53:00.833 --> 00:53:01.833
[phone rings]

860
00:53:27.458 --> 00:53:28.708
[horse neighs]

861
00:53:39.708 --> 00:53:41.750
[Paul] That's just before
she went to college.

862
00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:44.042
Before it all happened.

863
00:53:47.042 --> 00:53:49.958
And so she just disappeared?

864
00:53:52.208 --> 00:53:55.792
Her. another girl.
and a young man called Ian Preston.

865
00:53:55.875 --> 00:53:58.000
His people are from Burley Vale.

866
00:54:01.208 --> 00:54:03.292
He came home. eventually.

867
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:06.083
Sophie didn't.

868
00:54:09.083 --> 00:54:10.792
Obviously. we involved the police.

869
00:54:12.083 --> 00:54:14.208
After a few days. she called. [sighs]

870
00:54:14.292 --> 00:54:15.833
She said that she was safe.

871
00:54:15.917 --> 00:54:19.958
that they were doing something important.
and that they would be gone for some time.

872
00:54:21.708 --> 00:54:23.708
The police lost interest after that.

873
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:26.750
So why do you say she was kidnapped?

874
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:29.708
Do you think
she was making the call under duress?

875
00:54:30.375 --> 00:54:33.375
Not duress exactly. More like… [sighs]

876
00:54:34.208 --> 00:54:35.125
More like what?

877
00:54:37.125 --> 00:54:38.167
He brainwashed her.

878
00:54:45.042 --> 00:54:47.000
-Where are we?
-One last mission.

879
00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:48.792
-[gasps] But I thought--
-Hey.

880
00:54:49.667 --> 00:54:50.667
No questions.

881
00:54:57.375 --> 00:54:59.167
[Paul] Of course I tried to find them.

882
00:54:59.708 --> 00:55:03.083
I traced her credit card withdrawals
all over the country.

883
00:55:04.083 --> 00:55:06.083
But I was always two steps behind.

884
00:55:06.875 --> 00:55:09.042
I thought.
if only I could see her face-to-face.

885
00:55:09.125 --> 00:55:11.417
I could jolt her out of this madness.

886
00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:12.667
but I never could.

887
00:55:13.833 --> 00:55:16.250
It was a phone call here. a letter there.

888
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:21.167
Never asking how we were.
Never saying she missed us.

889
00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:23.792
-Just only ever asking for money.
-Money?

890
00:55:23.875 --> 00:55:25.333
That's all she ever wanted.

891
00:55:26.333 --> 00:55:30.083
In the end. she asked for her share
of the inheritance. She wanted it now.

892
00:55:31.208 --> 00:55:32.458
Before we died.

893
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.167
And did you give her the money?

894
00:55:39.333 --> 00:55:41.250
[Paul sighs] Yes.

895
00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:43.708
I realize now
it was the wrong thing to do.

896
00:55:45.917 --> 00:55:48.125
How much did you end up giving her?

897
00:55:51.083 --> 00:55:52.708
About £300.000.

898
00:56:38.875 --> 00:56:42.000
If there's any way
you could get him to lead you to her.

899
00:56:42.083 --> 00:56:43.417
any way at all…

900
00:56:44.292 --> 00:56:45.750
Ah… I mean. I…

901
00:56:46.417 --> 00:56:48.042
I don't really…

902
00:56:48.125 --> 00:56:50.583
-How?
-[Paul] You're still close to him.

903
00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:53.583
If you could keep it that way
a while longer.

904
00:56:53.667 --> 00:56:55.833
maybe he could tell you where she is.

905
00:56:55.917 --> 00:56:58.333
Find something out. anything.

906
00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.292
I. uh-- I can't promise anything.

907
00:57:00.958 --> 00:57:02.875
I've got so much to think about.

908
00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:07.208
Thank you.

909
00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:09.458
And…

910
00:57:10.333 --> 00:57:11.375
I'm sorry.

911
00:57:13.958 --> 00:57:17.167
Do you believe in God. Miss Archer?

912
00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:18.750
And the devil?

913
00:57:21.375 --> 00:57:23.542
I. uh… I don't really think about it.

914
00:57:23.625 --> 00:57:24.708
Well. I do.

915
00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:29.083
I believe that some people
have been put on this Earth

916
00:57:29.167 --> 00:57:31.000
to be the agents of one or the other.

917
00:57:31.667 --> 00:57:33.625
Robert Freegard is such an agent.

918
00:57:34.708 --> 00:57:36.125
and he's not the Lord's.

919
00:58:03.125 --> 00:58:04.542
Alice Archer.

920
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:08.583
Alice Archer.

Oh.

924
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:28.917
-Hey.
-Hi.

925
00:58:35.375 --> 00:58:37.917
I called you at work today.
They said you were out.

926
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000
I was.

927
00:58:40.042 --> 00:58:41.583
-Where were you?
-[cork pops]

928
00:58:42.083 --> 00:58:43.583
I was at a meeting.

929
00:58:49.375 --> 00:58:50.417
[sighs]

930
00:59:00.958 --> 00:59:02.125
We need to talk.

931
00:59:09.958 --> 00:59:11.083
I'm sorry.

932
00:59:12.792 --> 00:59:13.875
What for?

933
00:59:14.833 --> 00:59:16.250
Sorry I doubted you.

934
00:59:17.792 --> 00:59:18.917
I had a choice.

935
00:59:19.958 --> 00:59:23.667
To believe you. to put my faith in you.
or to let you down.

936
00:59:24.958 --> 00:59:26.417
And I let you down.

937
00:59:29.333 --> 00:59:30.667
It won't happen again.

938
00:59:32.042 --> 00:59:33.250
I love you.

939
00:59:34.583 --> 00:59:35.875
[chuckles]

940
00:59:44.292 --> 00:59:45.625
I'm here for you.

941
00:59:47.625 --> 00:59:48.625
Always.

942

946
01:00:15.917 --> 01:00:18.958
-Why are we doing this?
-It's need-to-know.

[Sophie sighs]

948
01:00:21.333 --> 01:00:22.792
Oh God. I don't think I can.

949
01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:25.500
You do not question me
in the middle of a mission.

950
01:00:30.708 --> 01:00:33.792
[man] Can't decide
whether to buy them or sue them.

951
01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:36.583
-[sighs]
-What do we think? A takeover?

952
01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:40.417
Or do we go to war with them?
Just crush them in litigation?

953
01:00:42.917 --> 01:00:45.542
-Alice? What course of action?
-[gasps]

954
01:00:48.917 --> 01:00:50.042
Um…

955
01:00:50.958 --> 01:00:51.958
Sorry.

956
01:00:54.208 --> 01:00:56.917
I pay a lot of money for your advice.

957
01:00:57.708 --> 01:00:59.917
The very least I expect is your attention.

958
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.042
Of course.

959
01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:03.625
[computer chi]

960
01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:11.542
Oh. you bastard.

961
01:01:12.417 --> 01:01:14.417
You fucking bastard.

962
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.708
[gasps]
-[Andrew] Alice!

963
01:01:23.042 --> 01:01:24.208

966
01:01:53.917 --> 01:01:56.708
Miss Archer. DC Sonny Chandra.
Greater London Police.

967
01:01:57.458 --> 01:01:58.542
Yeah. Come in.

968
01:02:02.292 --> 01:02:04.000
[Sonny sighs]

969
01:02:05.125 --> 01:02:09.208
We. uh checked with our colleagues
in security services.

970
01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:12.667
He's not one of theirs. Never has been.

971
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:14.917
No. of course not.

972
01:02:16.042 --> 01:02:18.500
-In terms of the money he's withdrawn--
-Stolen.

973
01:02:19.333 --> 01:02:23.042
Well. on that point. because he was
a joint signatory on the business account.

974
01:02:23.125 --> 01:02:24.583
it makes it a bit more complicated.

975
01:02:24.667 --> 01:02:25.708
What do you mean?

976
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:30.375
We need to hear his side of the story
to establish if a crime's been committed.

977
01:02:30.458 --> 01:02:31.917
You're not serious?

978
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.167
[sorry]

979
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:34.958
I'm sorry.

980
01:02:36.167 --> 01:02:37.417
[Sonny sighs]

981
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:41.167
Try not to feel too bad.
This kind of thing happens all the time.

982
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:42.583
More often than you think.

983
01:02:47.417 --> 01:02:50.375
He knew I knew. Then he moved first.

984
01:02:51.125 --> 01:02:52.583
I'm a fucking idiot.

985
01:02:54.958 --> 01:02:57.667
-You don't have to agree.
-Wh-- No.  no. I was…

986
01:02:58.542 --> 01:03:00.542
Sorry. I was just…

987
01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:02.292

-Yes.

991
01:03:27.375 --> 01:03:30.167
<i>This is DC Sonny Chandra</i>
<i>with the Greater London Police.</i>

992
01:03:31.042 --> 01:03:34.917
<i>I need to speak to you about alleged fraud</i>
<i>perpetrated against the bank accounts</i>

993
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.417
<i>of a Miss Alice Archer.</i>

994
01:03:38.292 --> 01:03:39.792
Is that what she told you?

995
01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:43.333
[chuckles] Look.

996
01:03:43.917 --> 01:03:48.167
we've had a couple of disagreements
about how to proceed with our business.

997
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:52.167
Uh. I've withdrawn a sum of money.
which I'm legally entitled to do.

998
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:54.542
in order to purchase a fleet of cars.

999
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:57.917
[laughing] But I can assure you.
there is no fraud.

1000
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.708
Would you be willing to attend
a police station to discuss it?

1001
01:04:00.792 --> 01:04:02.042
<i>Yeah. of course.</i>

1002
01:04:02.125 --> 01:04:05.000
<i>Uh… I'm back in London on Wednesday.</i>

1003
01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:07.458
<i>-Say. four p.m.?</i>
-Okay.

1004
01:04:07.542 --> 01:04:11.625
Yep. fine. It's the Notting Hill station.
Ask for me at the front desk. Chandra.

1005
01:04:11.708 --> 01:04:13.208
Great. I'll see you then.

1006
01:04:13.875 --> 01:04:16.125
I'm looking forward
to straightening this out.

1007
01:04:18.542 --> 01:04:19.417

1016
01:05:34.917 --> 01:05:37.458
[sighs] What have I been training you for
all these years?

1017
01:05:37.958 --> 01:05:40.917
-To be a field officer.
-And what is the role of a field officer?

1018
01:05:41.417 --> 01:05:44.458
To blend in and survive
over a long time in any environment.

1019
01:05:44.542 --> 01:05:47.208
Inconspicuous. self-reliant. tough.

1020
01:05:51.542 --> 01:05:52.792
Stay in this postcode.

1021
01:05:52.875 --> 01:05:54.917
Someone will find you
and take you to the program.

1022
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.625
-When?
-Will you ask that question in the field?

1023
01:06:00.417 --> 01:06:02.458
Well. consider yourself in the field.

1024
01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:08.458
This is in case I need to contact you.

1025
01:06:09.083 --> 01:06:11.083
There's no credit on it.
Incoming calls only.

1026
01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:13.750
If you put credit on
or try to make a call. you have failed.

1027
01:06:13.833 --> 01:06:14.875
Do you understand?

1028
01:06:16.208 --> 01:06:17.208
Yeah.

You'll probably never hear this message.

1034
01:06:53.542 --> 01:06:55.958
but I want you to know
that you haven't broken me.

1035

It's important that you know

-Good. Fine.

1039
01:07:21.083 --> 01:07:22.500
You look tired.

1040
01:07:23.167 --> 01:07:25.500
You know you should
never say that to a woman.

1042
01:07:27.458 --> 01:07:29.167

Okay. look.

1049
01:07:43.625 --> 01:07:46.833
We think you should take some time off.
Couple of weeks.

-We?
-The partners.

-Really.

Andrew. tell me straight.

1053
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.542
Should I look for another job?

1054
01:08:13.667 --> 01:08:16.042
If you think you'd be happier
somewhere else.

1055
01:08:17.042 --> 01:08:18.500

01:08:47.292 --> 01:08:48.542
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1060
01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:51.458
You're sorry?

1061
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.625
<i>Yeah. I'm truly sorry.</i>

1062
01:08:55.583 --> 01:08:56.833
<i>For everything.</i>

1063
01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:59.958
<i>For the lies. For taking the money.</i>

1064
01:09:01.583 --> 01:09:05.917
<i>Listen. I-- I know you think</i>
<i>it was all one big lie. but it wasn't.</i>

1065
01:09:07.208 --> 01:09:08.292
<i>I love you.</i>

1066
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:13.375
<i>I think you are the only person</i>
<i>I've ever really loved.</i>

1067
01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.625
<i>In my whole life.</i>

1068
01:09:17.333 --> 01:09:18.333
<i>Only you.</i>

1069
01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:21.792
<i>I just…</i>

1070
01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:23.958
<i>I just want you to know that.</i>

1071
01:09:25.375 --> 01:09:26.583
<i>Goodbye. Alice.</i>

1072
01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:28.125
-[hangs up]
-[gasps]

1073
01:09:29.083 --> 01:09:30.375
[dialing]

1074
01:09:33.042 --> 01:09:34.125
[unavailable tone]

1075
01:09:34.208 --> 01:09:36.917
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>has not been recognized--</i>

1076
01:09:45.875 --> 01:09:46.958
[sighs]

1077
01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:49.625
[sniffles]

1078
01:09:51.958 --> 01:09:53.958
[glass slides on bar]

1079
01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:57.875
[man] Can I buy you a drink?

1080
01:09:57.958 --> 01:10:00.083
-[sighs] Sorry. I'm not--
-Hear me out.

1081
01:10:00.167 --> 01:10:02.333
One minute of your time.
Not a second more.

1082
01:10:03.417 --> 01:10:05.667
So. I was just thinking--

1083
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:07.667
You were just thinking…

1084
01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:10.750
You were just thinking…

1085
01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:13.500
"She's hot.

1086
01:10:14.208 --> 01:10:15.917
-Yeah.
-"Definitely hot."

1087
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.083
[laughs]

1088
01:10:17.167 --> 01:10:19.292
"She looks to be at least 30. though.

1089
01:10:19.792 --> 01:10:22.250
which means she's probably
one of those working women

1090
01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:24.708
that's starting to get
just a teensy bit desperate."

1091
01:10:24.792 --> 01:10:25.708
No. I was--

1092
01:10:25.792 --> 01:10:28.792
"She's just been sittin' here.
drinkin' alone.

1093
01:10:28.875 --> 01:10:30.917
which means she's probably upset."

1094
01:10:31.958 --> 01:10:33.417
"Maybe about a man."

1095
01:10:34.458 --> 01:10:37.875
"Which means she might be in the market
for an anger fuck."

1096
01:10:38.375 --> 01:10:40.083
Or a revenge fuck."

1097
01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:44.125
-"Or maybe just a plain old sad fuck."
-Listen. I wasn't gonna--

1098
01:10:44.208 --> 01:10:46.958
"But if I do get lucky and fuck her.

1099
01:10:47.625 --> 01:10:50.625
oh. I'd better make sure
not to leave any contact details

1100
01:10:50.708 --> 01:10:55.542
'cause this is the last kind of girl
I want trackin' me down in the mornin'."

1101
01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:59.875
"That would be an absolute train wreck."

1102
01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:04.667
Is that what you were "just thinkin'"?

1103
01:11:48.333 --> 01:11:49.292
Fucking…

1104
01:11:50.917 --> 01:11:52.250
Fucking bastard.

1105
01:11:52.333 --> 01:11:54.542
[yells] Fucking bastard!

1106
01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:57.042
Fucking bastard.

1107
01:11:58.917 --> 01:11:59.875
[yelling]

1108
01:12:02.792 --> 01:12:04.625
I need you to help me find him.

1109
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.208
-Alice. I don't think that's a good idea.
-I need you to help me. Phil.

1110
01:12:09.292 --> 01:12:11.375
Going after this guy is not the answer.

1111
01:12:11.875 --> 01:12:14.625
-The money's long gone.
-It's not about the money anymore.

1112
01:12:14.708 --> 01:12:16.250
Well. then. what is it about?

1113
01:12:17.042 --> 01:12:19.417
Revenge? I mean.
that's not gonna happen. Alice.

1114
01:12:24.583 --> 01:12:25.917
He's still in here.

1115
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:27.750
In my head.

1116
01:12:28.542 --> 01:12:31.875
And he won't get out
until I look him in the eye one last time.

1117
01:12:31.958 --> 01:12:33.792
Okay. listen. [sighs]

1118
01:12:35.333 --> 01:12:36.625
I was a copper for 18 years.

1119
01:12:36.708 --> 01:12:39.708
When you're doing that job.
you deal with three types of people.

1120
01:12:39.792 --> 01:12:43.500
Mad. sad. and bad.

1121
01:12:43.583 --> 01:12:46.000
"Mad" are people
with everyday mental health problems.

1122
01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:47.792
They get in trouble without wan

1123
01:12:47.875 --> 01:12:51.458
"Sad" are people who've had shit lives.
It's obvious why they end up criminals.

1124
01:12:52.125 --> 01:12:54.833
Those two are your vast majority
of perpetrators. but…

1125
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:58.208
"bad" is a different story.

1126
01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:01.833
Sociopaths. psychopaths.
fantasists. manipulators.

1127
01:13:01.917 --> 01:13:05.042
They spend their entire lives
destroying other people.

1128
01:13:05.625 --> 01:13:08.125
They're smart.
they're always one step ahead.

1129
01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:10.083
and they all have one thing in common.

1130
01:13:10.167 --> 01:13:11.292
What's that?

1131
01:13:11.375 --> 01:13:13.208
[sighs] They can't change.

1132
01:13:13.292 --> 01:13:15.708
They do what they do again.
and again. and again.

1133
01:13:15.792 --> 01:13:18.167
and they never. ever stop.

1134
01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:23.667
The only thing you can do is try
to stay as far away from them as possible.

1135
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:26.542
The last thing you wanna do
is ever see him again.

1136
01:13:26.625 --> 01:13:29.250
Try to find a way
to put things back together.

1137
01:13:29.333 --> 01:13:33.583
-Loads of firms need people like you.
-No. that's all over now. I'm done.

1138
01:13:42.042 --> 01:13:42.875
Phil.

1139
01:13:44.042 --> 01:13:45.042
Alice.

1140
01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:52.000
Would it surprise you
if I don't take your advice?

1141
01:13:52.083 --> 01:13:54.125
[chuckles] Course it bloody wouldn't.

1142
01:13:54.208 --> 01:13:55.500
But for God's sake.

1143
01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.708
be careful.

1144
01:13:57.792 --> 01:13:59.958
You're not gonna get better
than nine grand.

1145
01:14:00.042 --> 01:14:01.667
You can-- Daniel will attest to it.

1146
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:04.875
-Right-oh.
-Mmm.

1147
01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:06.500
Right-oh. So…

1148
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.500
-Wanna take a test drive?
-Yeah.

1149
01:14:09.292 --> 01:14:11.417
-Hi.
-Hello.

1150
01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:14.833
Any idea what you're looking for?

1151
01:14:17.333 --> 01:14:18.583
[laughs]

1152
01:14:36.917 --> 01:14:38.833
-Ian Preston?
-Yes.

1153
01:14:38.917 --> 01:14:41.000
Hi. I'm Alice Archer.

1154
01:14:41.583 --> 01:14:43.917
I need to talk to you
about Robert Freegard.

1155
01:14:47.417 --> 01:14:49.875
For two years.
we lived on the run from the IRA.

1156
01:14:50.375 --> 01:14:53.500
We used fake names.
always moving from one place to the next.

1157
01:14:54.458 --> 01:14:57.417
He told us the IRA wanted to kill us
to make an example of us.

1158
01:14:57.917 --> 01:15:01.250
He said if we ever went home
to our families. we'd put them in danger.

1159
01:15:01.333 --> 01:15:04.625
As time went on. he told us
we were candidates for a special program.

1160
01:15:04.708 --> 01:15:05.833
A program?

1161
01:15:05.917 --> 01:15:07.917
A recruitment program to join MI5.

1162
01:15:08.625 --> 01:15:10.083
To make us officers like him.

1163
01:15:10.167 --> 01:15:12.417
But to qualify.
we'd have to pass these tests.

1164
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.792
What kind of tests?

1165
01:15:13.875 --> 01:15:15.125
Spy stuff.

1166
01:15:15.917 --> 01:15:19.167
Delivering an envelope somewhere.
Following someone in the street.

1167
01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:20.750
To prove you were good enough.

1168
01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.375
And how long did all this go on for?

1169
01:15:23.875 --> 01:15:24.917
For me. it was…

1170
01:15:25.583 --> 01:15:26.583
four years.

1171
01:15:28.333 --> 01:15:29.750
I know it sounds ridiculous.

1172
01:15:29.833 --> 01:15:33.000
but he just has this way
of making you believe…

1173
01:15:34.083 --> 01:15:35.167
you know. anything.

1174
01:15:35.833 --> 01:15:37.833
It doesn't sound ridiculous to me.

1175
01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.292
[birds squawking]

1176
01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:42.375
[sheep bleating]

1177
01:15:43.292 --> 01:15:44.458
[sighs]

1178
01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:46.208
He told me something once.

1179
01:15:47.417 --> 01:15:50.417
It was a… a throwaway thing.
but I never forgot it.

1180
01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:51.667
[rooster crows]

1181
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:54.625
He said everybody's got a story
that they wanna be told.

1182
01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.000
What was your story?

1183
01:15:59.708 --> 01:16:01.375
Well. look around you. [chuckles]

1184
01:16:02.083 --> 01:16:03.250
I'm a farm boy.

1185
01:16:03.917 --> 01:16:06.667
A simple life. Boring. mostly.

1186
01:16:07.375 --> 01:16:09.083
He gave me the opposite of boring.

1187
01:16:11.083 --> 01:16:12.875
What was the story you wanted to hear?

1188
01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:17.667
That I could be free.

1189
01:16:19.042 --> 01:16:20.083
[sighs]

1190
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.375
Ian. can I ask you.

1191
01:16:28.958 --> 01:16:30.458
how did you get away?

1192
01:16:31.542 --> 01:16:33.042
[scoffs] Um…

1193
01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.083
Well. I-- I didn't.

1194
01:16:38.583 --> 01:16:39.750
Mmm…

1195
01:16:39.833 --> 01:16:42.958
Yeah. one day. I woke up.
and-- and they were just gone.

1196
01:16:45.917 --> 01:16:47.875
Yeah. I-- I didn't leave Freegard. Um…

1197
01:16:48.958 --> 01:16:49.958
He left me.

1198
01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:53.958
Him and Sophie and Mae
were-- were just gone.

1199
01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.375
Mae?

1200
01:16:55.875 --> 01:16:58.958
Yeah. Mae Hansen.
Yeah. she was with us for years.

1201
01:16:59.917 --> 01:17:00.792
Hansen?

1202
01:17:05.042 --> 01:17:06.750
[distant siren wailing]

1203
01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.875
[Sonny] Kidnapping?
He hasn't kidnapped anyone!

1204
01:17:11.958 --> 01:17:15.875
In 1993. he takes three students
from Trent Hamilton University.

1205
01:17:15.958 --> 01:17:18.208
Two of them. young women.
haven't been seen since.

1206
01:17:18.292 --> 01:17:21.458
-They got in touch with their families.
-To ask for money.

1207
01:17:21.542 --> 01:17:23.042
Sonny. for fuck's sake.

1208
01:17:23.583 --> 01:17:24.625
Okay. look.

1209
01:17:27.875 --> 01:17:32.083
All right. This is the legal definition
of kidnapping. Read it. Come on. Read it.

1210
01:17:32.167 --> 01:17:34.833
I know what the legal definition is.
This is ridiculous.

1211
01:17:34.917 --> 01:17:39.458
"Kidnapping is the taking of one person
or another by force or fraud."

1212
01:17:39.542 --> 01:17:42.542
Fraud is what he's doing.
This is a common-law indictable offense.

1213
01:17:42.625 --> 01:17:45.250
-We can make this stick.
-We? Are you a CPS lawyer now?

1214
01:17:45.333 --> 01:17:47.042
No. but I'm more of a lawyer than you are.

1215
01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:48.292
[silence]

1216
01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:51.208
-I'm sorry.
-[Sonny sighs]

1217
01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:53.042
Sometimes I get a bit carried away.

1218
01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:55.250
Yeah. you don't say. yeah. [sighs]

1219
01:18:03.125 --> 01:18:05.250
You say he's been using
Mae Hansen's name?

1220
01:18:05.333 --> 01:18:07.625
Sometimes he uses Robert Hansen.

1221
01:18:07.708 --> 01:18:11.208
Sometimes Robert Hansen-Freegard.
Sometimes just Robert Freegard.

1222
01:18:15.417 --> 01:18:16.833
Well. why would he do that?

1223
01:18:19.292 --> 01:18:20.458
Use her name in particular?

1224
01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:27.250
Okay. I'm gonna run Mae Hansen
through the PNC.

1225
01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:31.292
If she ever contacted emergency services.
there'll be an address.

1226
01:18:31.375 --> 01:18:33.292
It's not much. but it's worth a try.

1227
01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:37.125
But I'm warning you. the chances
of this going anywhere are…well…

1228

[woman] Have you always lived here alone?

1230
01:18:47.292 --> 01:18:48.292
Mmm--

1231
01:18:48.792 --> 01:18:51.958

You?

1233
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.125
Yes. unfortunately.

1234
01:18:59.417 --> 01:19:00.250
Wasn't pretty.

1235
01:19:04.708 --> 01:19:05.833
[woman laughs]

1236
01:19:13.375 --> 01:19:15.167
[both chuckle]

1237
01:19:16.042 --> 01:19:17.042
Sorry.

1238
01:19:17.625 --> 01:19:18.708
[laughs]

1239
01:19:19.208 --> 01:19:21.208
What did you do in America?

1240
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.667
Um… I was an academic. in psychology.

1241
01:19:28.875 --> 01:19:30.708
-Psychology?
-Yeah.

1242
01:19:31.708 --> 01:19:33.583
So you better be careful.

1243
01:19:34.542 --> 01:19:36.333
I can read you from a mile off.

1244
01:19:36.417 --> 01:19:37.417
Oh. I will.

1245
01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.958
[both laughing]

1246
01:19:42.167 --> 01:19:43.917
So go on. then. Hmm?

1247
01:19:45.375 --> 01:19:46.375
What's your secret?

1248
01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.958
-My secret?
-Yeah.

1249
01:19:51.083 --> 01:19:54.167
A guy like you. Lives all alone.

1250
01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:56.167
Doesn't talk much about his past.

1251
01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:59.792
Makes a mean spaghetti bolognese.
[laughs]

1252
01:20:01.667 --> 01:20:03.208
What are you hiding?

1253
01:20:05.625 --> 01:20:06.833
[laughs]

1254
01:20:06.917 --> 01:20:09.417
-Wow. you are good.
-I am! [laughs]

1255
01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:12.667
Phew. Uh…

1256
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:15.000
Well. Jenny… [chuckles]

1257
01:20:15.625 --> 01:20:18.750
I had been meaning to--
to tell you something.

1258
01:20:20.208 --> 01:20:21.917
Uh… it's about my job.

1259
01:20:24.667 --> 01:20:26.292
I'm not really a car salesman.

1260
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:30.708
[thunder rumbling]

1261
01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:32.125
[heavy rainfall]

1262
01:20:45.333 --> 01:20:47.125
[dog barking]

1263
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:59.375
[gulls calling]

1264
01:21:00.208 --> 01:21:02.375
[Jenny] Mm. I love this place.

1265
01:21:03.417 --> 01:21:04.708
[Robert] Yeah. me too.

1266
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:12.833
Have you ever considered
doing something completely different?

1267
01:21:13.542 --> 01:21:14.542
What do you mean?

1268
01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:17.625
I mean. like a new career.

1269
01:21:18.125 --> 01:21:20.708
[laughs] Like what?

1270
01:21:20.792 --> 01:21:24.458
Well. this is gonna sound
completely crazy…

1271
01:21:24.542 --> 01:21:26.083
[chuckles] Go on.

1272
01:21:28.667 --> 01:21:29.833
Uh…

1273
01:21:32.292 --> 01:21:35.708
Well. there's a recruitment round
coming up.

1274
01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:37.625
At work.

1275
01:21:38.708 --> 01:21:40.208
For intelligence analysts.

1276
01:21:40.292 --> 01:21:42.000
[laughs] What?

1277
01:21:43.167 --> 01:21:44.792
Oh my God.

1278
01:21:44.875 --> 01:21:47.417
What? You think I should become a spy?

1279
01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:50.375
No. you wouldn't be a field officer.
you'd be an analyst.

1280
01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:52.625
[laughs]

1281
01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:54.833
You have a background in psychology.

1282
01:21:55.792 --> 01:21:57.958
You can read people.
work out their motivations.

1283
01:21:58.042 --> 01:22:01.042
I-- I think you'd be really.
really good at it.

1284
01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:04.792
-But I'm American.
-We recruit NATO allies all the time.

1285
01:22:06.667 --> 01:22:08.042
-[laughs]
-[sighs]

1286
01:22:09.375 --> 01:22:12.500
[sighs] Robert.
I gotta tell you something.

1287
01:22:13.958 --> 01:22:16.000
Oh. God. Um. okay. here goes.

1288
01:22:16.083 --> 01:22:18.500
Um… I am actually on a…

1289
01:22:19.542 --> 01:22:22.208
pretty intense cocktail
of antidepressants.

1290
01:22:22.958 --> 01:22:24.125
Since my divorce.

1291
01:22:25.625 --> 01:22:27.333
So… [sighs]

1292
01:22:29.167 --> 01:22:32.750
So? I don't see why
that would be a problem.

1293
01:22:37.083 --> 01:22:38.167
[chuckles]

1294
01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:44.833
-And a mushy pea?
-[laughs] Gross.

1295
01:22:44.917 --> 01:22:46.500
-Really?
-Yeah!

1296
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:50.625
Listen. Jenny. uh…

1297
01:22:50.708 --> 01:22:52.583
-If you are gonna take this job…
-Mmm?

1298
01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:55.500
There are a couple of things
we need to discuss.

1299
01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:01.750
You mentioned you had
a lot of student debt?

1300
01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:03.750
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1301
01:23:04.875 --> 01:23:07.000
It might turn out
to be a bit of a problem.

1302
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.000
-Really?
-Yeah.

1303
01:23:09.083 --> 01:23:12.208
Everyone who goes to college
in the States is in debt.

1304
01:23:13.125 --> 01:23:14.000
Yeah. I know.

1305
01:23:14.083 --> 01:23:18.833
In this country. uh. the security services
see large debts owed by members of staff

1306
01:23:18.917 --> 01:23:21.083
as a potential liability.

1307
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.750
-Yeah. like a blackmail risk.
-[laughs]

1308
01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:26.083
-Really? Are you kidding me?
-No.

1309
01:23:26.708 --> 01:23:28.417
-[laughs]
-I know. It's ridiculous.

1310
01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:31.167
They're just--
they're just so set in their ways.

1311
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:33.083
It's-- it's absurd. [tuts]

1312
01:23:34.917 --> 01:23:36.625
How much is it. your student debt?

1313
01:23:37.167 --> 01:23:40.375
[sighs] Shit. I mean.
last time I checked. about…

1314
01:23:41.125 --> 01:23:42.458
$80.000.

1315
01:23:43.875 --> 01:23:46.083
-Yeah. Wow.
-Yeah. that's America.

1316
01:23:46.875 --> 01:23:47.875
Um…

1317
01:23:49.083 --> 01:23:51.667
And you have. uh…
you have no way of paying it back?

1318
01:23:52.167 --> 01:23:54.292
[laughs] I mean. let me check my pockets.

1319
01:23:54.375 --> 01:23:55.708
No. [laughs]

1320
01:23:56.833 --> 01:23:58.792
[clears throat]

1321
01:23:58.875 --> 01:23:59.875
Shit.

1322
01:24:00.792 --> 01:24:01.958
Um…

1323
01:24:02.042 --> 01:24:04.375
Well. listen.
if it really is a problem. I…

1324
01:24:05.375 --> 01:24:07.208
I guess I could ask my folks.

1325
01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:08.250
I mean… [sighs]

1326
01:24:08.833 --> 01:24:10.208
maybe I could ask them.

1327
01:24:13.167 --> 01:24:15.167
[Alice] Do you really think
this could be her?

1328
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:17.292
[Sonny] Date of birth matches.

1329
01:24:19.458 --> 01:24:22.083
-[Alice] Thank you for bringing me along.
-[knocks]

1330
01:24:23.125 --> 01:24:25.292
[Sonny] You just let me
take the lead. okay?

1331
01:24:29.583 --> 01:24:30.708
Mae Hansen?

1332
01:24:33.167 --> 01:24:34.000
Yes.

1333
01:24:34.083 --> 01:24:39.000
Did you attend Trent Hamilton University
with Ian Preston and Sophie Jones?

1334
01:24:41.542 --> 01:24:43.500
-Yes.
-I'm Detective Constable Chandra.

1335
01:24:43.583 --> 01:24:45.125
We're here about Robert Freegard.

1336
01:24:45.208 --> 01:24:47.958
-Or Hansen-Freegard. as he's also known.
-He's not here at the moment.

1337
01:24:49.833 --> 01:24:50.833
May we come in?

1338
01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.417
[quacking on TV]

1339
01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.708
[girl] <i>Oh. Jim!</i>
<i>Oh. the chickens are coming in the boat!</i>

1340
01:24:57.792 --> 01:24:58.917
[Alice] Thank you.

1341
01:24:59.917 --> 01:25:01.917
[quacking]

1342
01:25:02.625 --> 01:25:04.875
[Jim] <i>Depends. I'm going to the forest.</i>

1343
01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:06.542
[girl] <i>Please. Jim!</i>

1344
01:25:06.625 --> 01:25:07.875
Who are these children?

1345
01:25:08.375 --> 01:25:09.583
They're our girls.

1346
01:25:10.458 --> 01:25:11.542
Mine and Rob's.

1347
01:25:18.542 --> 01:25:20.167
[Sonny] How often do you see him?

1348
01:25:22.792 --> 01:25:24.125
He comes and goes.

1349
01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:26.708
His work is very important.

1350
01:25:28.583 --> 01:25:30.292
But he looks after you?

1351
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:32.958
You and the children?

1352
01:25:39.375 --> 01:25:40.375
Look. Mae.

1353
01:25:41.417 --> 01:25:42.458
Are you okay?

1354
01:25:44.667 --> 01:25:45.750
Can we help you?

1355
01:25:47.708 --> 01:25:49.542
If you ask for help. I can help you.

1356
01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:57.458
He said this would happen.

1357
01:25:58.208 --> 01:25:59.250
[Alice] What?

1358
01:25:59.333 --> 01:26:03.542
He said you would come
and try to test me to see if I was loyal.

1359
01:26:05.125 --> 01:26:06.208
No. Mae.

1360
01:26:06.792 --> 01:26:08.042
This isn't a test.

1361
01:26:08.125 --> 01:26:10.958
-Unless you've something else to say. go.
-He's in danger.

1362
01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:13.250
What?

1363
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:17.375
Rob may be in danger
because of the important work he does.

1364
01:26:17.458 --> 01:26:20.458
and we need to find him
because we need to warn him.

1365
01:26:21.042 --> 01:26:22.333
That's all I can say.

1366
01:26:23.083 --> 01:26:25.667
You understand? It's national security.

1367
01:26:27.208 --> 01:26:31.167
Now. do you know of anything
that can help us find him?

1368
01:26:31.958 --> 01:26:34.333
-An address. a-- a phone number. anything.
-Listen.

1369
01:26:34.417 --> 01:26:36.625
-I think we should--
-Mae. we need to find him.

1370
01:26:36.708 --> 01:26:38.125
We need to warn him.

1371
01:26:38.625 --> 01:26:39.625
Please.

1372
01:26:46.708 --> 01:26:47.833
There's a notebook.

1373
01:26:49.042 --> 01:26:51.542
In his sock drawer.
It has phone numbers in it.

1374
01:26:54.333 --> 01:26:56.250
I can't believe it you did that.
I could be fired.

1375
01:26:56.333 --> 01:26:59.042
It's just mobile phone numbers.
Line after line of them.

1376
01:26:59.125 --> 01:27:00.917
-Must be hundreds.
-It doesn't prove anything.

1377
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.292
Doesn't prove anything? Are you serious?

1378
01:27:03.375 --> 01:27:05.250
-This could be how we track him down!
-Then what?

1379
01:27:05.333 --> 01:27:06.917
-Come on!
-I'm serious. Where's the crime?

1380
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.333
Go on. you're the lawyer. Where?

1381
01:27:08.417 --> 01:27:12.208
And even if we did get all this to court.
what will a jury make of Mae Hansen?

1382
01:27:12.292 --> 01:27:14.875
-She's the mother of his children!
-Don't you see?

1383
01:27:14.958 --> 01:27:16.833
He never ever stops.

1384
01:27:16.917 --> 01:27:19.875
He goes on and on.
destroying people's lives.

1385
01:27:19.958 --> 01:27:21.500
until somebody stops him.

1386
01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:26.667
[sighs]

1387
01:27:30.208 --> 01:27:33.708
Look. I'm sorry. all right?
That must have been…

1388
01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:37.333
[sighs] That must have been hard.
seeing the kids and that…

1389
01:27:39.667 --> 01:27:40.833
It's not enough.

1390
01:27:42.333 --> 01:27:43.708
None of this is enough.

1391
01:27:45.042 --> 01:27:46.333
[men laughing]

1392
01:27:47.208 --> 01:27:48.417
[Sonny sighs]

1393
01:27:50.375 --> 01:27:51.625
[Alice sighs]

1394
01:27:55.042 --> 01:27:57.750
[girl yells] Mum! You don't listen!

1395
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:03.250

<i>The number you have dialed</i>

1404
01:29:14.333 --> 01:29:16.333
[clock ticking]

1405

1406
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.458
[laughs]

1407
01:29:38.542 --> 01:29:40.792
It is a bit strange
they still haven't called.

1408
01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:42.958
It's a lot of money. Robert.

1409
01:29:43.542 --> 01:29:44.542
Takes time.

1410
01:29:48.083 --> 01:29:50.917
Look. I don't have to apply for this job
this time round.

1411
01:29:51.417 --> 01:29:52.417
I can wait.

1412
01:29:53.292 --> 01:29:54.750
I mean. to be honest… [sighs]

1413
01:29:55.667 --> 01:29:57.583
I'm not even really sure I should apply.

1414
01:29:57.667 --> 01:30:00.333
I don't think you realize
that there won't be a next time.

1415
01:30:02.042 --> 01:30:02.917
Oh…

1416
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:07.667
-Robert. what are you doing?
-[sighs]

1417
01:30:10.458 --> 01:30:11.583
What are you doing?

1418
01:30:13.417 --> 01:30:15.042
What the fuck are you doing?

1419
01:30:15.125 --> 01:30:18.042
-You don't need those things.
-Those are my meds! I need my meds!

1420
01:30:18.125 --> 01:30:20.625
No. we're gonna get you off them.
starting today.

1421
01:30:20.708 --> 01:30:22.875
Those aren't drugs
you can quit. cold turkey.

1422
01:30:22.958 --> 01:30:25.042
-I can't do that.
-Yes. you can. You can.

1423
01:30:25.125 --> 01:30:27.250
Yes. you can. I'm right here. okay?

1424
01:30:27.833 --> 01:30:30.500
I'm right here. I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.

1425
01:30:30.583 --> 01:30:32.208
I promise you. Jenny. [chuckles]

1426
01:30:33.083 --> 01:30:34.833
This is a good thing. okay?

1427
01:30:35.625 --> 01:30:37.542
It's a good thing. It's a good thing.

1428
01:30:38.917 --> 01:30:39.833
Hey.

1429
01:30:45.958 --> 01:30:47.292
[knocking]

1430
01:30:54.292 --> 01:30:55.500

[Alice groans]

1432
01:30:59.708 --> 01:31:01.083
[clears throat]

1433
01:31:01.167 --> 01:31:03.125
-Out all night again?
-Piss off.

1434
01:31:05.542 --> 01:31:07.708
-You were right.
-What?

1435
01:31:08.375 --> 01:31:09.583
He never stops.

1436
01:31:10.875 --> 01:31:11.875
Can you come with me?

1437
01:31:11.958 --> 01:31:13.250
Where are we going?

1438
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:15.125
To the American embassy.

1439
01:31:18.167 --> 01:31:19.292
Give me ten minutes.

1440
01:31:22.208 --> 01:31:23.042
Five.

1441
01:31:24.375 --> 01:31:27.792
[woman] Thank you for coming. Miss Archer.
Special Agent Harland.

1442
01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.000
Please. follow me.

1443
01:31:34.667 --> 01:31:35.917
Have a seat.

1444
01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:42.500
So.

1445
01:31:43.125 --> 01:31:46.667
I understand that you have
some experience of this guy.

1446
01:31:47.292 --> 01:31:48.667
What's all this about?

1447
01:31:50.375 --> 01:31:55.083
The FBI is concerned about the whereabouts
of an American citizen.

1448
01:31:56.292 --> 01:31:57.333
Jenny Jackson.

1449
01:31:57.833 --> 01:32:01.458
She's been here in the UK
for three months.

1450
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.167
Usually. she calls her parents
several times a week.

1451
01:32:05.250 --> 01:32:06.500
but about three weeks ago.

1452
01:32:06.583 --> 01:32:08.833
she darn near fell off
the face of the Earth.

1453
01:32:09.625 --> 01:32:11.292
Then a couple of days ago.

1454
01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:14.042
she called her parents in Connecticut

1455
01:32:14.542 --> 01:32:17.917
and asked them for $80.000.

1456
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.333
She said she needed to clear
her student debt in preparation for a job

1457
01:32:22.417 --> 01:32:25.042
that her boyfriend was providing for her.

1458
01:32:25.583 --> 01:32:29.167
The boyfriend goes by the name
of Robert Freegard.

1459
01:32:31.542 --> 01:32:33.250
[car horns beeping]

1460
01:32:34.125 --> 01:32:36.083
[Harland] Did you get
comms surveillance up on him?

1461
01:32:36.833 --> 01:32:38.292
We never got that far.

1462
01:32:41.417 --> 01:32:43.875
[sighs] I have a notebook.

1463
01:32:45.167 --> 01:32:48.542
It's just numbers.
All his-- his burner phones.

1464
01:32:48.625 --> 01:32:51.417
I've called about half of them.
but they're all disconnected.

1465
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.292
Can you show 'em to me?

1466
01:32:55.208 --> 01:32:57.250
-What?
-Agent Harland.

1467
01:32:58.250 --> 01:33:00.667
I don't want your people
calling those numbers.

1468
01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:02.792
Excuse me?

1469
01:33:02.875 --> 01:33:05.042
If we get through to Robert or Jenny

1470
01:33:05.125 --> 01:33:07.583
or any of his victims.
they could really screw this up.

1471
01:33:07.667 --> 01:33:11.042
We have just one shot at this. Just one.

1472
01:33:11.125 --> 01:33:16.042
My agents are trained investigators.
Negotiators.

1473
01:33:16.125 --> 01:33:18.417
But they don't know
Robert Freegard like I do.

1474
01:33:19.458 --> 01:33:22.375
-Let me make the calls.
-I can get a court order.

1475
01:33:25.083 --> 01:33:28.083
Actually. you'd need
an evidential retrieval order.

1476
01:33:28.167 --> 01:33:30.125
That's usually a High Court matter.

1477
01:33:32.208 --> 01:33:33.333
I see what you mean.

1478
01:33:35.333 --> 01:33:38.083
You make the calls. I listen in.

1479
01:33:38.792 --> 01:33:39.917
We work together.

1480
01:33:40.417 --> 01:33:41.417
Deal.

1481
01:34:05.958 --> 01:34:08.667

-Hey.
<i>-The number you have dialed…</i>

1487
01:34:22.125 --> 01:34:25.833
Yeah. get me purchase points
on every handset on this list.

1488
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.958
Put 'em all on a map. Plot 'em out.

1489
01:34:29.042 --> 01:34:30.500
Get 'em right to me. Thanks.

1491
01:34:31.667 --> 01:34:33.583
-They going through on your end?
-All good.

1492
01:34:33.667 --> 01:34:34.792
Perfect.

1496
01:34:43.292 --> 01:34:44.500
Let me call you back.

1497
01:34:46.125 --> 01:34:47.125
Who's this?

1498
01:34:47.625 --> 01:34:48.750
[Alice] <i>Sophie…</i>

1499
01:34:48.833 --> 01:34:51.167
Um… My name's Alice.

1500
01:34:51.250 --> 01:34:54.750
I'm a-- I'm a colleague of Rob's.
I work with him.

1501
01:34:54.833 --> 01:34:56.042
<i>Where is Rob?</i>

1502
01:34:56.792 --> 01:34:59.083
I can't discuss that on the phone. Sophie.

1503
01:35:00.042 --> 01:35:02.375
Listen. We're ready to bring you in.

1504
01:35:03.042 --> 01:35:04.417
Oh…

1505
01:35:05.625 --> 01:35:07.375
Have-- have I passed?

1506
01:35:09.417 --> 01:35:11.458
That-- that's right. Sophie. You have.

1507
01:35:12.292 --> 01:35:13.500
<i>You've passed.</i>

1508
01:35:16.625 --> 01:35:18.792
Rob said it would be him
that brought me in.

1509
01:35:19.292 --> 01:35:22.583
<i>He's on a mission.</i>
<i>You'll see him very soon.</i>

1510
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:26.292
Okay.

1511
01:35:26.792 --> 01:35:29.208
Sophie. where are you?

1512
01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:31.750
What's your location?

1513
01:35:33.875 --> 01:35:34.833
Um…

1514
01:35:36.917 --> 01:35:37.917
Mom.

1515
01:35:38.708 --> 01:35:40.667
if you could send the money.

1516
01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:43.083
it will really help
with this new opportunity.

1517
01:35:43.917 --> 01:35:45.125
This means a lot to me.

1518
01:35:45.208 --> 01:35:48.875
and everything will go smoothly
once the debt has been cleared.

1519
01:35:50.667 --> 01:35:51.667
Mom?

1520
01:35:52.583 --> 01:35:55.292
I really need you
to send this money. okay? Please.

1521
01:36:00.042 --> 01:36:02.042
[breathing shakily]

1522
01:36:04.292 --> 01:36:06.667
-I'm really not feeling very well. Robert.
-Sh.

1523
01:36:09.208 --> 01:36:10.583
Can you help me?

1524
01:36:16.542 --> 01:36:18.375
[gasping]

1525
01:36:19.792 --> 01:36:21.708
Okay. listen. This is important.

1526
01:36:22.208 --> 01:36:24.625
When we get to her.
we can't tell her the truth.

1527
01:36:24.708 --> 01:36:25.542
Wait. What?

1528
01:36:25.625 --> 01:36:29.958
If we want to find Jenny.
we can't tell Sophie Jones the truth.

1529
01:36:30.042 --> 01:36:31.458
-Not yet.
-[Sonny] Why not?

1530
01:36:32.792 --> 01:36:34.583
Because it would destroy her.

1531
01:36:37.708 --> 01:36:39.083
[rustling]

1532
01:36:42.875 --> 01:36:44.583
[Jenny whimpering]

1533
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.250

1535
01:37:08.625 --> 01:37:09.625
Robert.

1536
01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:13.125
I… [sobs]

1537
01:37:14.792 --> 01:37:16.125
I need my meds.

1538
01:37:19.208 --> 01:37:20.375
[sighs]

1539
01:37:21.125 --> 01:37:22.833
[retching]

1540
01:38:16.375 --> 01:38:17.750
Hello. Sophie.

1541
01:38:19.542 --> 01:38:20.542
I'm Alice.

1542
01:38:24.667 --> 01:38:25.833
Those are my colleagues.

1543
01:38:27.125 --> 01:38:28.375
Are you ready to go?

1544
01:38:29.167 --> 01:38:31.250
-[sobbing]
-Sophie…

1545
01:38:32.417 --> 01:38:33.625
You've done so well.

1546
01:38:37.875 --> 01:38:40.208
[Alice] Oh… It's okay.

1547
01:38:41.417 --> 01:38:42.417
It's okay.

1548
01:38:43.708 --> 01:38:44.750
[grunting]

1549
01:38:57.250 --> 01:38:58.625
Now. then… [grunts]

1550
01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:08.792
There you are.

1551
01:39:09.583 --> 01:39:11.083
You can puke there all you want.

1552
01:39:42.917 --> 01:39:44.250
[yells]

1553
01:39:47.667 --> 01:39:49.083
[sighs]

1554
01:39:53.583 --> 01:39:55.792
As part of your training with Rob.

1555
01:39:56.708 --> 01:39:59.167
you stayed in a lot of safe houses. yes?

1556
01:39:59.250 --> 01:40:00.708
Yeah. dozens.

1557
01:40:00.792 --> 01:40:03.542
And did any of them stand out to you?

1558
01:40:04.417 --> 01:40:05.542
What do you mean?

1559
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.083
Do any of them feel different?

1560
01:40:09.167 --> 01:40:12.000
Like. maybe somewhere
that felt more like home.

1561
01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:15.667
Um…

1562
01:40:18.583 --> 01:40:21.583
Well. there-- there was one place I…

1563
01:40:22.292 --> 01:40:25.792
-I had to wear a blindfold on the way.
-Yeah. yeah. Exactly like that.

1564
01:40:26.417 --> 01:40:29.208
And do you remember.
even roughly. where it was?

1565
01:40:31.333 --> 01:40:32.958
[Sophie] Well. um…

1566
01:40:33.542 --> 01:40:38.125
Rob taught me that if…
if you're deprived of one of your senses.

1567
01:40:38.208 --> 01:40:41.708
you can learn what you need
to know from the others. so. um…

1568
01:40:42.333 --> 01:40:44.542
we came sou-- south out of Cambridge.

1569
01:40:45.167 --> 01:40:48.833
um. and then when we came off the M11.
that's when I put the blindfold on.

1570
01:40:49.792 --> 01:40:50.958
Um…

1571
01:40:51.042 --> 01:40:53.958
So. we went straight
for about ten minutes.

1572
01:40:54.042 --> 01:40:56.042
I counted the seconds. And then…

1573
01:40:56.792 --> 01:41:00.250
we turned left. up into the hills.
for about 30 minutes.

1574
01:41:04.333 --> 01:41:05.333
