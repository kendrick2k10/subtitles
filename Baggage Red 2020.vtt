it without his lovely wife Olivia.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.173
- So please. will you
tell us how you two met?

188
00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:43.720
- Yes. it was about six months ago.

189
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.553
- Six months.

190
00:14:44.553 --> 00:14:47.670
- And it was at dinner.
cause we had mutual friends.

191
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.482
And psychiatrists and lawyers.

192
00:14:50.482 --> 00:14:51.315
- They're weird.

193
00:14:51.315 --> 00:14:53.601
- [Jack] Getting all together. yeah.

194
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:54.434
- [Waiter] Can I fill that for you?

195
00:14:54.434 --> 00:14:57.313
- Yeah. so Jack.

196
00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.457
What do you do?

197
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.360
- Well I graduated from law
school so now I'm thinking.

198
00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:14.040
I'm probably. hopefully.
start my own practice

199
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.266
I think actually. it's the plan.

200
00:15:16.266 --> 00:15:18.957
- He's being modest. he
graduated top of his class dad.

201
00:15:18.957 --> 00:15:20.874
He's brilliant. really.

202
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.946
- I know a few people
in the legal profession.

203
00:15:24.946 --> 00:15:25.779
- Do you?

204
00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.977
- Dad come on. stop trying to scare him.

205
00:15:31.386 --> 00:15:34.375
- [Jack] But yes. no.
that's the plan anyway.

206
00:15:34.375 --> 00:15:36.775
(tense music)

207
00:15:36.775 --> 00:15:40.707
- Olivia darling. what are your plans?

208
00:15:40.707 --> 00:15:41.540
- I'm thinking about it.

209
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.890
I'm still keeping all of the options open.

210
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.460
but I. I would like to
start my own practice.

211
00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.293
- [Jack] You should.
it's such a good idea.

212
00:15:49.293 --> 00:15:51.311
- [Mom] Yes. you must.

213
00:15:51.311 --> 00:15:52.443
It'd be wonderful.

214
00:15:52.443 --> 00:15:55.597
- I know. all that work paid off. perfect.

215
00:15:57.098 --> 00:15:59.791
- You'd make a beautiful therapist.

216
00:15:59.791 --> 00:16:02.541

217
00:16:09.376 --> 00:16:12.376

220
00:17:03.365 --> 00:17:05.198

224
00:17:17.649 --> 00:17:19.372
I need to tell you something now.

225
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.289
- Yes love?

226
00:17:22.993 --> 00:17:26.030
- I love you. but it's
time I started to show it.

227
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.613
- Yes. I understand it. I love you.

228
00:17:32.728 --> 00:17:37.007
- You understand that if someone loves you

229
00:17:37.007 --> 00:17:38.623
you show it. you get me?

230
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.393
- Yes. I get. I get you.

231
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.203
I'm all yours.

232
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:52.217
I breath for you. I need you to touch me.

Hello Luca. take a seat.

242
00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.580
Okay Luca. I want you to
just focus on your breath

243
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.930
cause I need you to relax. okay?

244
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.513
So just focus on breathing
in and breathing out.

245
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.867
Slow down. do not rush it.

246
00:19:14.867 --> 00:19:16.600
There's no need to rush it.

247
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.603
This time is for you. I'm here for you.

248
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.843
That's better Luca. well done.

249
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.200
So I want to try to do
a psychoanalysis session

250
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.770
with you by role play.

251
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.120
But do not be afraid. this is a technique

252
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.490
that I use with other patients.
and it is very effective.

253
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.160
It will help you not to think

254
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.970
about the trauma of abuse you have done.

255
00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.890
And this is your first
step to your healing.

256
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.573
So I need you to trust me.

257
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.970
I'm going to grab your
hands. but not be afraid.

258
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.537
I know what I'm doing.

00:26:16.631 --> 00:26:17.560
- It's a big case.

371
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.893
- [Olivia] It is. I agree. absolutely.

372
00:26:21.461 --> 00:26:23.874
I'm so proud of you working this case.

373
00:26:23.874 --> 00:26:28.874
(voices whispering)
- [Woman] Help. help. help.

374
00:26:29.839 --> 00:26:33.172
- [Olivia] Jack. she's not looking good.

375
00:26:34.931 --> 00:26:36.977
- Mother. what are you thinking about?

376
00:26:36.977 --> 00:26:39.644
(ominous music)

377
00:26:40.838 --> 00:26:41.671
- [Olivia] Is she on medication?

378
00:26:41.671 --> 00:26:42.504
- She's fine.

379
00:26:42.504 --> 00:26:43.590
- [Olivia] Jack. she doesn't look fine.

380
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.824
- She's fine.

381
00:26:44.824 --> 00:26:47.491
(ominous music)

382
00:26:54.076 --> 00:26:56.909
(voice screaming)

383
00:26:58.252 --> 00:26:59.085
- Grace?

384
00:27:00.881 --> 00:27:01.798
- I'm okay.

385
00:27:03.033 --> 00:27:03.866
I'm good.

386
00:27:06.928 --> 00:27:07.761
- Good.

387
00:27:08.736 --> 00:27:09.881
- Enjoy your meal.

388
00:27:09.881 --> 00:27:11.381
- Yeah. thank you.

389
00:27:14.249 --> 00:27:16.669
- She's working to
hard. aren't you mother?

390
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:17.919
Get some sleep?

391
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.918
- She doesn't need some sleep.

392
00:27:21.918 --> 00:27:24.501
(eerie music)

393
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.713
- Hey doc. did you see it?

394
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.500
The third one in a row.

395
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.053
Last week he was on the news.

396
00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.520
Aren't you proud?

397
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.563
I think I did a great job.

398
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.010
What. you're criticizing me now?

399
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.713
Like you're the greatest parents?

400
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.063
Come on. why can't you ever be happy?

401
00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:10.423
I'm talking about Jack here.

402
00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:13.743
Whatever.

403
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.066
I think it did a great job.

404
00:28:18.066 --> 00:28:20.816
(ominous music)

405
00:29:04.514 --> 00:29:05.510
- Olivia.

406
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.987
- Are we going to talk
about it at some point.

407
00:29:06.987 --> 00:29:09.987
or are you just going to pretend
nothing happened yesterday?

408
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.310
- What happened yesterday?

409
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.560
- Jack are you kidding me?

410
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.093
Didn't you notice what happened
last night with your mother?

411
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.300
- Last night we went to dinner.

412
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.800
- I'm sorry. can you please
close the book. and stop reading

413
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.250
and pay attention to me.
is that too much to ask?

414
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:30.063
Please?

415
00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.173
Oh thank you.

416
00:29:35.682 --> 00:29:36.515
- Right.

417
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:39.780
What's the matter?

418
00:29:41.705 --> 00:29:43.349
- Are you really. I
mean are you kidding me.

419
00:29:43.349 --> 00:29:45.380
or did you realize what
happened last night?

420
00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:46.482
There was something really
wrong about your mother.

421
00:29:46.482 --> 00:29:48.117
- What happened last night.
we had dinner with my mother

422
00:29:48.117 --> 00:29:49.710
and we came home. what. what's wrong?

423
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:53.390
- Yeah and I have found out

424
00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.270
that you've been keeping things from me.

425
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:56.470
alongside your mother.

426
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:57.425
- I've been keeping things from you?

427
00:29:57.425 --> 00:29:58.258
- Yes.

428
00:29:58.258 --> 00:29:59.403
- Olivia. what are you talking about?

429
00:29:59.403 --> 00:30:01.570
- I don't care that she lies to you.

430
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.590
or that she lies to me. but when it comes

431
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.800
to you lying to me. it's a
whole different matter Jack.

432
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.090
- Oh my goodness. so we went for supper.

433
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:08.680
we come back. we go to sleep. we wake up

434
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.553
and now my mother lies
to you. I lie to you?

435
00:30:10.553 --> 00:30:11.604
- I don't care about your mum.

436
00:30:11.604 --> 00:30:12.437
- What are you talking about?

437
00:30:12.437 --> 00:30:14.530
- I care about that lie
about her and you lie to me.

438
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:15.720
- No ones lying to anyone.

439
00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.370
- Of course. yes.

440
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:18.688
She's been keeping things from you.

441
00:30:18.688 --> 00:30:20.392
have you noticed at least?

442
00:30:20.392 --> 00:30:21.225
- No.

443
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.943
Okay fine. I mean last
night. well she was off.

444
00:30:26.828 --> 00:30:27.661
- Thank you.

445
00:30:27.661 --> 00:30:28.494
- She was off a little
bit. but everyone's off.

446
00:30:28.494 --> 00:30:29.327
- A little bit?

447
00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:30.160
- You and your mother are off sometimes.

448
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.720
- I'm sorry. I'm the psychologist here.

449
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.553
I can see right through her.

450
00:30:32.553 --> 00:30:34.653
- Well done. what do you see
then. what's there to see?

451
00:30:34.653 --> 00:30:36.520
- There's something serious

452
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.440
that she's keeping from you Jack.

453
00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.290
You have to make her tell
the truth. you know that?

454
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.457
And you cannot keep things from me.

455
00:30:42.457 --> 00:30:43.760
you know we're married here.

456
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.800
- Okay. I know we're married.

457
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.750
- Then let's start acting like you are.

458
00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:51.210
I can't accept this Jack. you know?

459
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.020
- Fine. fine.

460
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.420
I will go later today

461
00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.371
and I'll talk to her
and ask her what's up.

462
00:30:59.371 --> 00:31:01.760
- Thank you. you will
go. thank you so much

463
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.390
for considering me. you
know we're just a couple.

464
00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:06.487
- We will go.

465
00:31:06.487 --> 00:31:07.320
- Fuck off!

466
00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.323
- We will go. we will go. later.

467
00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:11.632
- Thank you. thank you.

468
00:31:11.632 --> 00:31:12.465
- Okay.

469
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:20.220
Olivia. look. we can
go together as a couple

470
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.370
and find out what's wrong with her.

471
00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:25.523
the truth and whatever you see.

472
00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:27.483
- Whatever I see?

473
00:31:27.483 --> 00:31:30.513
- We can go together as a
couple. we can go after lunch.

474
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.140
Please. you're right.

475
00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.340
I wouldn't want anything
to come between us.

476
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.950
Please?

477
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.050
We can go after lunch.

478
00:31:40.692 --> 00:31:41.525
My dear?

479
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.393
Monkey?

480
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.689
Yeah?

481
00:31:47.689 --> 00:31:48.716
A little smile?

482
00:31:48.716 --> 00:31:49.549
- No.

483
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:50.382
- No monkey smile?

484
00:31:50.382 --> 00:31:51.215
- No.

485
00:31:51.215 --> 00:31:52.048
- We go after lunch?

486
00:31:52.048 --> 00:31:52.881
- Yeah.

487
00:31:52.881 --> 00:31:53.714
- Yes.

488
00:31:53.714 --> 00:31:54.547
Okay. come on.

489
00:31:54.547 --> 00:31:56.604
It's fine. let's have
some breakfast. come on.

490
00:31:56.604 --> 00:31:59.271
(ominous music)

491
00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:38.307
- [Olivia] It's so cute. have you seen it?

492
00:32:38.307 --> 00:32:39.140
Hey. hey.

493
00:32:41.798 --> 00:32:42.631
- Yeah?

494
00:32:42.631 --> 00:32:44.381
- Look. come look at.

495
00:32:46.155 --> 00:32:46.988
Honey. I just want to go take

496
00:32:46.988 --> 00:32:49.360
a look at that shop we saw earlier.

497
00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.093
- Well don't buy everything.

498
00:32:51.093 --> 00:32:52.812
- [Olivia] I'll try.

499
00:32:52.812 --> 00:32:55.312
(tense music)

500
00:33:00.999 --> 00:33:02.916
- It's quite some view.

501
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.053
My name's Jack.

502
00:33:09.626 --> 00:33:11.759
- We know who you are.

503
00:33:11.759 --> 00:33:14.259
(eerie music)

504
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.900
- Jack don't forget. we are lawyers.

505
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.330
we're a different breed of intellect.

506
00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:41.343
It's our privilege to lie.

507
00:33:49.096 --> 00:33:52.513
- [Jack] The problem is that. she did it.

508
00:33:54.614 --> 00:33:57.114
(tense music)

509
00:34:02.716 --> 00:34:05.383
The problem is that. she did it.

510
00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.293
- [Man] It's our privilege to lie.

511
00:34:17.125 --> 00:34:19.326
It's our privilege to lie.

512
00:34:19.326 --> 00:34:22.743
- [Jack] The problem is that. she did it.

513
00:34:23.667 --> 00:34:24.750
- [Man] Jack.

514
00:34:26.932 --> 00:34:27.818
Jack.

515
00:34:27.818 --> 00:34:30.318
(tense music)

516
00:34:32.143 --> 00:34:34.310
It's our privilege to lie.

517
00:34:36.431 --> 00:34:39.461
(Jack snorting)

518
00:34:39.461 --> 00:34:41.158
It's our privilege to lie.

519
00:34:41.158 --> 00:34:43.658
(tense music)

520
00:34:44.514 --> 00:34:47.931
- [Jack] The problem is that. she did it.

521
00:34:49.903 --> 00:34:50.736
- [Man] Jack.

522
00:34:50.736 --> 00:34:53.236
(tense music)

523
00:35:05.238 --> 00:35:08.238
(people chattering)

524
00:35:11.853 --> 00:35:14.947
- [Jack] The problem is that.

525
00:35:14.947 --> 00:35:17.421
The problem. the problem
is that. she did it.

526
00:35:17.421 --> 00:35:19.921
(tense music)

527
00:35:23.333 --> 00:35:26.312
The problem is that. she did it.

528
00:35:26.312 --> 00:35:29.206
(people chattering)
(tense music)

529
00:35:29.206 --> 00:35:31.956
(dramatic music)

530
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.250
- Mr. Casey.

531
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:09.410
Do you have a moment please?

532
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:10.623
- Yes. sure.

533
00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.251
- Detective Michael Berelli.

534
00:36:14.251 --> 00:36:16.490
I'm searching for Olivia Bailey.

535
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:17.543
- Yes. that's me.

536
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.513
What's the problem detective?

537
00:36:20.513 --> 00:36:22.974
Is there a problem. what's going on?

538
00:36:22.974 --> 00:36:25.683
- My office has received a
complaint about your practice.

539
00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:27.200
I need to ask you a few questions.

540
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.850
- Detective I think there's
been some kind of mistake.

541
00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.563
My wife is a professional.

542
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.643
- Sir. calm down.

543
00:36:34.643 --> 00:36:36.920
This is just an investigation.

544
00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.570
No one has been accused of anything yet.

545
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:40.403
- It's okay.

546
00:36:41.881 --> 00:36:43.173
How can I help you detective.

547
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.380
We're sorry. this is just
out of the ordinary for us.

548
00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:49.500
- I understand.

549
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:53.550
I'm sure we can get to the bottom of this.

550
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:55.580
We have a couple complaints from a man

551
00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.930
who say you are their therapist.

552
00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:00.000
They say you met with some of them.

553
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.510
and they say you were
asking them to do things

554
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:05.230
that are uncomfortable. and unusual.

555
00:37:06.207 --> 00:37:07.040
- Unusual?

556
00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:11.690
I deal with people who are
psychologically unstable.

557
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:14.270
I have to analyze if
they can fit into society

558
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:19.270
so that they do not kill or
become a menace to this country.

559
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.258
- And?

560
00:37:20.258 --> 00:37:22.600
- That should help you from

561
00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.703
having to investigate a real crime.

562
00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.660
- Then you shouldn't
have problem with taking

563
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.610
a detection test at out
office if we need it.

564
00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:34.440
- Mr. Berelli. I think you
should check your sources.

565
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.773
My wife and I are late
for lunch. good day.

566
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.150
- I will be in contact.

567
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:41.805
Thank you for your time.

568
00:37:41.805 --> 00:37:44.555
(dramatic music)

569
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:03.517
- Are you guys all right?

570
00:38:03.517 --> 00:38:05.127
(Jack coughs)

571
00:38:05.127 --> 00:38:06.127
- Of course.

572
00:38:14.426 --> 00:38:19.426
Actually. Olivia and I came here

573
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.750
to talk to you about something.

574
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.010
We both feel that there's something

575
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:29.410
you're not telling us mother.

576
00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:32.480
and now is the time to get things

577
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.090
out in the open and be honest.

578
00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:37.300
- I don't know what you're talking about.

579
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.970
- Yesterday evening.
at dinner. Olivia felt.

580
00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:46.970
we felt. that you were
hiding something from us.

581
00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:48.180
- Was this your idea?

582
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.390
- Seriously?

583
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:53.223
- [Grace] Sorry?

584
00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.786
- Yesterday was so clear
that you were lying to us.

585
00:38:57.786 --> 00:38:58.619
And you know what?

586
00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:02.690
I don't care only this
is affecting out marriage

587
00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:04.930
because he started to lie. he lied to me

588
00:39:06.122 --> 00:39:07.295
and I'm not gonna let it.

589
00:39:07.295 --> 00:39:08.128
- [Jack] May it's just a misunderstanding.

590
00:39:08.128 --> 00:39:09.072
- I'm not gonna allow it.

591
00:39:09.072 --> 00:39:10.760
- [Jack] There's no
point shouting about it.

592
00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.024
- What are you talking about?

593
00:39:12.024 --> 00:39:13.857
- Guys. guys. guys.

594
00:39:13.857 --> 00:39:15.510
- You know what?

595
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:18.116
I don't care if you don't want to tell me.

596
00:39:18.116 --> 00:39:20.216
But to talk to him and tell him the truth.

597
00:39:24.164 --> 00:39:25.620
- Mother. what she's trying to say

598
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.819
is that I think it's time to be honest.

599
00:39:28.819 --> 00:39:29.652
- Or what?

600
00:39:29.652 --> 00:39:32.153
- Or you'll be seeing a lot less of me.

601
00:39:33.828 --> 00:39:35.013
And her. and us.

602
00:39:44.193 --> 00:39:47.280
- You know there are things that are

603
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.253
better not to be said or known.

604
00:39:55.545 --> 00:39:57.760
I don't think you'll like me anymore.

605
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.180
- Mother it's not about whether I like you

606
00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:05.867
any more or less. I'm your
son. I'll always love you.

607
00:40:07.113 --> 00:40:09.946
It's just about telling the truth.

608
00:40:11.097 --> 00:40:13.160
Look I understand if you
don't want to tell Olivia.

609
00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:18.160
it's your choice. it's your
choice. but you can tell me.

610
00:40:20.086 --> 00:40:22.073
Would it make it easier
if I came back later?

611
00:40:24.383 --> 00:40:25.216
Yeah?

612
00:40:26.547 --> 00:40:28.714
Okay. let's do that. okay?

613
00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:31.903
Okay.

614
00:40:49.045 --> 00:40:49.878
Cold.

615
00:40:50.734 --> 00:40:52.174
- Yeah.

616
00:40:52.174 --> 00:40:53.457
- See you soon again.

617
00:40:53.457 --> 00:40:54.290
- Bye. thank you.

618
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:55.123
- Bye.

619
00:40:55.123 --> 00:40:56.473
- [Jack] Bye mom. see well.

620
00:41:02.906 --> 00:41:05.573
(ominous music)

621
00:41:10.257 --> 00:41:12.253
(phone beeping)

622
00:41:12.253 --> 00:41:14.753
(phone rings)

623
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:23.370
- Yeah. listen I. Jack and
Olivia were here yesterday and.

624
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:32.650
I don't know. Olivia
doesn't seem too well.

625
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.360
You know. we've had our differences

626
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.140
and I'm probably not the easiest.

627
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.850
but I still want him to be happy.

628
00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:47.850
so I thought it would be good if you

629
00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:50.783
had a mother daughter talk with her.

630
00:41:52.112 --> 00:41:54.779
(ominous music)

631
00:41:57.330 --> 00:42:02.330
I don't know. distraught. and
I know somethings not right.

632
00:42:03.551 --> 00:42:06.218
(ominous music)

633
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:11.870
What does that mean?

634
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:14.537
(ominous music)

635
00:42:18.996 --> 00:42:19.829
Enough!

636
00:42:21.051 --> 00:42:22.901
Listen. we cannot tell them anything.

637
00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.827
We know that in this world you need

638
00:42:25.827 --> 00:42:28.403
to have assets and without
them. we are nothing.

639
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.070
Okay.

640
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:38.090
Just whatever you do. do
not tell them anything.

641
00:42:41.836 --> 00:42:43.086
Okay. okay bye.

642
00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.699
- Goodbye Grace.

643
00:42:45.699 --> 00:42:48.366
(ominous music)

644
00:42:54.002 --> 00:42:57.835
- Am I willing to sacrifice
my son for riches?

645
00:42:58.671 --> 00:43:03.565
(worms writhing)
(ominous music)

646
00:43:03.565 --> 00:43:06.232
(ominous music)

647
00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.353
- Dad?

648
00:43:32.387 --> 00:43:36.070
When I went in last night.
I felt something really bad.

649
00:43:40.416 --> 00:43:42.553
And I felt lost.

650
00:43:46.048 --> 00:43:48.103
I know.

651
00:43:48.103 --> 00:43:49.800
I know.

652
00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.213
Stop it. it pains me day and night.

653
00:43:53.213 --> 00:43:56.213
(voices whispering)

654
00:43:59.080 --> 00:43:59.913
Stop it!

655
00:44:02.695 --> 00:44:03.528
Stop it.

656
00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.816
I don't know what you're talking about.

657
00:44:07.816 --> 00:44:10.483
(ominous music)

658
00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.410
(sirens blaring)

659
00:44:26.305 --> 00:44:29.091
(radios chattering)

660
00:44:29.091 --> 00:44:31.731
- I'm checking on the case.

661
00:44:31.731 --> 00:44:33.731
No. I'll call you later.

662
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:02.567
So their parents.

663
00:45:09.062 --> 00:45:10.479
Very interesting.

664
00:45:12.382 --> 00:45:13.965
Berelli here. yeah?

665
00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.673
Have you heard about Madison Plures case?

666
00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:20.943
Oh.

667
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:24.263
Really?

668
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:30.133
Thanks. yeah.

669
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.590
- [Voice] Kill.

670
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:51.761
(ominous music)

671
00:45:51.761 --> 00:45:52.594
Kill.

672
00:45:52.594 --> 00:45:54.838
(ominous music)

673
00:45:54.838 --> 00:45:55.671
Kill.

674
00:45:55.671 --> 00:45:58.338
(ominous music)

675
00:46:10.161 --> 00:46:11.865
(ominous music)

676
00:46:11.865 --> 00:46:14.615
(doorbell rings)

677
00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.426
- How can I help you sir?

678
00:46:20.426 --> 00:46:22.008
- Detective Michael Berelli.

679
00:46:22.008 --> 00:46:22.841
Can I come in?

680
00:46:22.841 --> 00:46:23.947
- Yes of course. please.

681
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.340
- I'm investigating on a case
which involves your sons wife.

682
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.380
- Okay. what is it?

683
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.990
- My office ask me to investigate

684
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:38.903
on an unconventional practice.

685
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.490
- She is the best therapist in Europe.

686
00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:44.700
you don't know what you're talking about.

687
00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.500
She's a diamond in this horrible world.

688
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.570
- I understand. but I
still must do my job.

689
00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:52.817
so I have a question for you.

690
00:46:52.817 --> 00:46:54.593
Do you know anything about

691
00:46:54.593 --> 00:46:58.207
a 1978 death of Ms. Madison Plures?

692
00:46:59.123 --> 00:47:00.493
- I don't know what your talking about.

693
00:47:00.493 --> 00:47:02.690
Is this about my daughter in law?

694
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:04.930
- No. I have to follow up on all leads

695
00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:06.530
that can be related to our case.

696
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:10.713
- I understand but I really
have to go back to work.

697
00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:14.865
Would you mind to leave now detective?

698
00:47:14.865 --> 00:47:16.321
(door creaks)

699
00:47:16.321 --> 00:47:17.154
I'm sorry.

700
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:19.543
- Certainly.

701
00:47:20.945 --> 00:47:23.631
(ominous music)

702
00:47:23.631 --> 00:47:24.673
But I'm gonna be back if I find

703
00:47:24.673 --> 00:47:27.123
that you are lying very soon.

704
00:47:27.123 --> 00:47:29.790
(ominous music)

705
00:47:41.093 --> 00:47:43.843
(ominous music)

706
00:48:34.203 --> 00:48:35.450
- Are you okay?

707
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:37.150
- [Jack] Yeah. did you sleep well?

708
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:39.655
- Yeah.

709
00:48:39.655 --> 00:48:42.322
(ominous music)

710
00:48:51.731 --> 00:48:54.462
- There was no bread left.

711
00:48:54.462 --> 00:48:55.633
- [Olivia] It's all right.

712
00:48:55.633 --> 00:48:58.300
(ominous music)

713
00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:10.946
- Grace.

714
00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.010
- Excuse me?

715
00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:15.280
- I know what you did.

716
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.423
- Stop harassing me.

717
00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:19.853
- I've got your number Grace!

718
00:49:19.853 --> 00:49:23.903
- (speaking in foreign language)

719
00:49:36.511 --> 00:49:39.831
(ominous music)

720
00:49:39.831 --> 00:49:41.817
I don't know how long
I can go on like this.

721
00:49:41.817 --> 00:49:45.453
- If you don't say the truth
now you will lose everything.

722
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:47.610
- What about Jack?

723
00:49:49.601 --> 00:49:50.753
What about my son?

724
00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:54.713
You see what is happening.

725
00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.913
I feel he's suffering because of me.

726
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:02.990
because of what I did.

727
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:05.130
- You have to choose now.

728
00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:07.797
(ominous music)

729
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:16.623
(dramatic music)

730
00:50:24.869 --> 00:50:29.869
(people chattering)
(dramatic music)

731
00:50:45.513 --> 00:50:47.158

914
01:07:38.228 --> 01:07:39.451
I'm listening.

915
01:07:39.451 --> 01:07:42.201
(dramatic music)

916
01:07:46.753 --> 01:07:50.010
- You know we weren't always rich.

917
01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:52.543
We were poor common people.

918
01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.170
I befriended an old lady who was very rich

919
01:07:58.180 --> 01:07:59.760
and I took care of her estate

920
01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:03.183
because I was intelligent
and great with numbers.

921
01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:06.450
So I took care of her estate

922
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:13.023
and she trusted me with her life.

923
01:08:15.781 --> 01:08:18.407
Only I got greedy.

924
01:08:18.407 --> 01:08:21.173
And I wanted more power and more money.

925
01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.680
So I agreed with the family that

926
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.563
we would find a way to kill her.

927
01:08:34.104 --> 01:08:35.140
And they would set an agreement

928
01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.250
that I would get a percentage

929
01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:39.423
of the estate worth
millions if I participated.

930
01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:45.523
I couldn't follow through.
but her family did.

931
01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.680
I tried to back out of the agreement

932
01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.563
because I believe it's wrong

933
01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:57.798
but they didn't let me.

934
01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:01.085
Instead they killed her

935
01:09:04.365 --> 01:09:06.773
and placed her body into a red suitcase.

936
01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.073
This is really hard.

937
01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:15.913
but I had no idea they would blackmail me.

938
01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:21.670
They put the suitcase under
the house when I wasn't home.

939
01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.800
I couldn't report it to the police

940
01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.060
because they would have arrested

941
01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:29.173
me as an accomplice to the crime.

942
01:09:30.690 --> 01:09:32.610
And every time I approached the suitcase

943
01:09:32.610 --> 01:09:36.290
to dump it into the sea. a demon appeared

944
01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:41.290
that threatened to kill you
and everybody near to me.

945
01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:51.780
Anyways about a month
later I went to the bank

946
01:09:52.037 --> 01:09:57.037
and there were 75 million euros
deposited into my account.

947
01:10:01.355 --> 01:10:05.533
And I took it.

948
01:10:12.897 --> 01:10:13.980
I'm so sorry.

949
01:10:16.814 --> 01:10:19.564
(dramatic music)

950
01:10:24.539 --> 01:10:25.372
- Sorry?

951
01:10:30.136 --> 01:10:32.553
All of this and you're sorry?

952
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:39.740
(dramatic music)

953
01:10:46.171 --> 01:10:51.171
(Grace crying)
(dramatic music)

954
01:11:09.633 --> 01:11:13.120
Mother. get that suitcase
out of this house.

955
01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.877
Do you understand what it's doing to me!

956
01:11:15.877 --> 01:11:20.100
Tell the police. tell the
truth. it's ruining my life!

957
01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:22.720
If that suit case and you
are not out of this house

958
01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.961
tomorrow night. I will take
to to the station myself!

959
01:11:25.961 --> 01:11:27.805
Do you understand?

960
01:11:27.805 --> 01:11:29.201
Get rid of it!

961
01:11:29.201 --> 01:11:34.201
(demon whispering)
(tense music)

962
01:11:40.548 --> 01:11:42.691
(Grace screams)

963
01:11:42.691 --> 01:11:44.829
- Stop it. stop.

964
01:11:44.829 --> 01:11:46.246
God. God help me.

965
01:11:49.376 --> 01:11:51.043
God. please help me.

966
01:11:54.353 --> 01:11:56.427
I can't do this anymore. I can't do this.

967
01:11:56.427 --> 01:11:58.744
(demon whispering)

968
01:11:58.744 --> 01:12:01.994
- [Demon] She's running. she's running.

969
01:12:14.402 --> 01:12:15.934
- Oh Jack you made it. look at you know.

970
01:12:15.934 --> 01:12:17.831
look at you now. you've done it!

971
01:12:17.831 --> 01:12:21.347
Well done you. well done you.

972
01:12:21.347 --> 01:12:23.459
Mr. Vanderbilt. Mr.
Vanderbilt. Mr. Vanderbilt.

973
01:12:23.459 --> 01:12:26.551
Hello Mr. Vanderbilt. lovely
to see you Mr. Vanderbilt.

974
01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:28.870
you want. you want. I can have your money?

975
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:30.533
Look at you Jack. you've done it.

976
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:41.953
They've lied.

977
01:12:43.679 --> 01:12:44.762
They've lied.

978
01:12:50.865 --> 01:12:51.698
Olivia.

979
01:12:57.812 --> 01:12:59.145
They lied to us!

980
01:13:00.657 --> 01:13:03.157
(Jack crying)

981
01:13:11.381 --> 01:13:12.631
She lied to us!

982
01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:18.774
(engine rumbles)

983
01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:31.131
(lighter clicking)

984
01:13:31.131 --> 01:13:33.881
(engine rumbles)

985
01:13:39.694 --> 01:13:40.861
My own mother.

986
01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.861
My own mother!

987
01:13:45.861 --> 01:13:48.611
(dramatic music)

988
01:13:58.214 --> 01:14:03.214
(dramatic music)
(people chattering)

989
01:14:10.164 --> 01:14:11.703
- You were so close.

990
01:14:11.703 --> 01:14:15.018
Yeah. yeah. Chris was telling me.

991
01:14:15.018 --> 01:14:16.101
- Jack. Jack.

992
01:14:17.105 --> 01:14:18.063
Can I talk to you for a second?

993
01:14:18.063 --> 01:14:19.563
- Sure. what's up?

994
01:14:22.015 --> 01:14:23.177
- Be careful.

995
01:14:23.177 --> 01:14:25.844
(ominous music)

996
01:14:28.599 --> 01:14:32.349
- The world is yours.
take whatever you want.

997
01:14:35.929 --> 01:14:38.830
- Jack. a lie is not a lie.

998
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:43.830
(people chattering)
(dramatic music)

999
01:14:44.692 --> 01:14:47.192
- Jack. always tell the truth.

1000
01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.923
- We know what you want. so just take it.

1001
01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:02.043
- God is always watching. and listening.

1002
01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.050
- Jack can I talk to you for a second?

1003
01:15:05.050 --> 01:15:07.371
- Yeah. one sec. sorry.

1004
01:15:07.371 --> 01:15:08.300
What's up?

1005
01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.160
- Jack don't forget.

1006
01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:13.590
We as lawyers. we're a
different breed of intellect.

1007
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:15.463
It's our privilege to lie.

1008
01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:18.800
Now you have these people fooled.

1009
01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.730
but I know who you really are.

1010
01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:21.820
Do you want to go outside

1011
01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:24.735
and take some of this nervousness away?

1012
01:15:24.735 --> 01:15:27.485
(dramatic music)

1013
01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:31.000
- Sure. yeah. I'm in.

1014
01:15:31.941 --> 01:15:34.691
(dramatic music)

1015
01:16:04.983 --> 01:16:07.733
(engine rumbles)

1016
01:16:19.856 --> 01:16:22.689
(dramatic music)

1017
01:16:30.264 --> 01:16:32.031
(door knocks)

1018
01:16:32.031 --> 01:16:34.781
(dramatic music)

1019
01:16:45.644 --> 01:16:47.365
(door creaks)

1020
01:16:47.365 --> 01:16:48.198
- Olivia.

1021
01:16:48.198 --> 01:16:49.031
- Where is mom?

1022
01:16:49.031 --> 01:16:50.448
- She's in there.

1023
01:16:52.046 --> 01:16:52.879
- Darling?

1024
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:55.312
Are you okay?

1025
01:16:57.109 --> 01:16:58.410
- [Olivia] I need to talk to you.

1026
01:16:58.410 --> 01:16:59.243
- What's wrong. Olivia?

1027
01:16:59.243 --> 01:17:00.340
- [Olivia] Right now?

1028
01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:01.173
Can you please.

1029
01:17:01.173 --> 01:17:03.060
- I can't. not right this moment darling.

1030
01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:04.580
I can't talk right now.

1031
01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:06.422
- [Olivia] Actually you can.
this is what we're gonna do

1032
01:17:06.422 --> 01:17:08.810
and you're gonna tell me the truth so.

1033
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:09.809
- Darling even if I--

1034
01:17:09.809 --> 01:17:11.370
- This time we're doing my way.

1035
01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:13.469
- This is neither the time nor the place.

1036
01:17:13.469 --> 01:17:14.302
- Mum. you're not--

1037
01:17:14.302 --> 01:17:16.593
- I've heard enough. you know what?

1038
01:17:21.805 --> 01:17:24.090
Olivia please. please.

1039
01:17:24.090 --> 01:17:27.274
(dramatic music)

1040
01:17:27.274 --> 01:17:28.436
Please understand.

1041
01:17:28.436 --> 01:17:31.605
- I'm sorry. we came here for answers

1042
01:17:31.605 --> 01:17:32.663
and now you're telling me you don't

1043
01:17:32.663 --> 01:17:34.050
even wanna talk right now?

1044
01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:35.440
- [Caroline] I don't want to talk.

1045
01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.210
- I cannot go on like this.

1046
01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:38.690
we don't know what we're going through.

1047
01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:40.602
I can't go on like this.

1048
01:17:40.602 --> 01:17:42.730
- You have no idea. you have no idea.

1049
01:17:42.730 --> 01:17:46.363
Your father and I. we became
rich when we were young.

1050
01:17:47.219 --> 01:17:50.473
We were poor. we didn't
know how we would survive.

1051
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:53.519
- Mum. you are stalling!

1052
01:17:53.519 --> 01:17:54.421
- [Caroline] Please!

1053
01:17:54.421 --> 01:17:55.254
- I don't give a shit about this!

1054
01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:57.923
- [Caroline] Okay. okay. you want me

1055
01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:59.723
to tell you. you want me to tell you?

1056
01:17:59.723 --> 01:18:01.300
- Yes. yes. I know that something else

1057
01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.683
is causing this. I need to know it now.

1058
01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:08.233
- Okay. you want the truth. okay.

1059
01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:11.173
Okay.

1060
01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:17.490
During the 1990s your father

1061
01:18:17.490 --> 01:18:20.530
and I met a gentleman at a nightclub

1062
01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:23.943
we used to go to to
connect with rich people.

1063
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:26.940
We were seeking opportunities

1064
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:31.573
and these gentlemen.
they liked out company.

1065
01:18:33.388 --> 01:18:37.055
and they liked our
style. didn't they Kevin?

1066
01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:41.369
So he introduced us to prostitution

1067
01:18:41.369 --> 01:18:43.263
and how to run a brothel.

1068
01:18:43.263 --> 01:18:46.013
(dramatic music)

1069
01:18:50.277 --> 01:18:53.243
This man. he gave us.
he gave us a brothel.

1070
01:18:55.890 --> 01:18:59.373
And the house. this
house. it had many women.

1071
01:19:03.733 --> 01:19:08.133
And the man who gave us
the house. he started to.

1072
01:19:11.970 --> 01:19:14.060
He started to send underage girls

1073
01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:21.440
because men. men would pay
so much money for them.

1074
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:27.513
We didn't like it.

1075
01:19:29.142 --> 01:19:33.160
But he insisted. he
threatened to kick us out

1076
01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.733
if we didn't go along with it.

1077
01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.683
So we agreed.

1078
01:19:42.723 --> 01:19:45.380
And after years of this life style.

1079
01:19:47.237 --> 01:19:48.123
and many of these young women.

1080
01:19:48.123 --> 01:19:50.720
they ended up with psychological problems

1081
01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:53.672
which they took with them
into their adult life.

1082
01:19:53.672 --> 01:19:56.505
(Caroline crying)

1083
01:19:57.906 --> 01:20:00.656
- But in the end. I'd had enough.

1084
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:09.253
And I insisted that these
girls should go home.

1085
01:20:11.384 --> 01:20:13.993
And we shut the house down.

1086
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.523
We closed the brothel.

1087
01:20:22.090 --> 01:20:25.404
- I knew there was something
else. now I see why.

1088
01:20:25.404 --> 01:20:28.197
Now I see why I've been acting.

1089
01:20:28.197 --> 01:20:30.383
why I've been feeling so promiscuous.

1090
01:20:31.712 --> 01:20:34.462
(dramatic music)

1091
01:20:36.192 --> 01:20:38.467
- Darling can't you just understand?

1092
01:20:38.467 --> 01:20:39.940
Just please. understand.

1093
01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:43.467
The reason we have so much.
the reason we have everything.

1094
01:20:47.882 --> 01:20:49.536
We bought many properties

1095
01:20:49.536 --> 01:20:53.570
and we became successful
real estate owners.

1096
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:55.390
We stopped the prostitution.

1097
01:20:56.772 --> 01:21:00.189
- The house is. the house is still there.

1098
01:21:03.718 --> 01:21:08.072
- [Olivia] What do you
mean. it's still there?

1099
01:21:08.072 --> 01:21:09.489
- It's abandoned.

1100
01:21:11.275 --> 01:21:13.525
But it's. it's still alive.

1101
01:21:17.891 --> 01:21:19.619
- Oh my God.

1102
01:21:19.619 --> 01:21:21.817
That's why this is happening.

1103
01:21:21.817 --> 01:21:22.650
That's why this is happening.

1104
01:21:22.650 --> 01:21:24.920
we have to burn the house down.

1105
01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.820
That's why I'm going through all this.

1106
01:21:29.083 --> 01:21:32.750
And you didn't think
we had to burn it down?

1107
01:21:34.451 --> 01:21:36.738
We have to burn it down.
we have to burn it down.

1108
01:21:36.738 --> 01:21:39.264
(Olivia crying)
(dramatic music)

1109
01:21:39.264 --> 01:21:41.250
I'm gonna burn it down. don't touch me!

1110
01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:46.250
(women crying)
(dramatic music)

1111
01:21:53.366 --> 01:21:58.366
(fire crackling)
(dramatic music)

1112
01:22:44.288 --> 01:22:49.288
(bell ringing)
(dramatic music)

1113
01:23:11.554 --> 01:23:12.887
- Greetings all.

1114
01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:18.063
It is great to have you.
may peace be with you.

1115
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:23.370
You know in life you have the choices.

1116
01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:26.743
You can tell the truth or you can lie.

1117
01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:29.583
You can believe the curse.

1118
01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:33.243
or you cannot believe the curse.

1119
01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:38.310
But in end it will be your decision

1120
01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:42.313
in life to make the right choice.

1121
01:23:43.628 --> 01:23:47.303
Life is not promised with
anything you desire or want.

1122
01:23:49.206 --> 01:23:53.387
But the one thing you
do have is your choices.

1123
01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:59.613
May the Lord be with you. amen.

1124
01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:10.633
- Well Grace. you get to come with me.

1125
01:24:12.374 --> 01:24:14.841
We have more evidence on the case.

1126
01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:17.591
(dramatic music)

1127
01:24:23.331 --> 01:24:26.623
Okay Grace. are you ready
to tell the truth now?

1128
01:24:26.623 --> 01:24:29.373
(dramatic music)

1129
01:24:41.396 --> 01:24:44.146
(dramatic music)

1130
01:24:56.379 --> 01:24:59.129
(waves crashing)

1131
01:25:10.702 --> 01:25:13.960
- [Olivia] Jack. I'm
just gonna take a shower.

1132
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:14.793
- Okay.

1133
01:25:16.145 --> 01:25:18.895
(waves crashing)

1134
01:25:21.537 --> 01:25:26.537
(dramatic music)
(waves crashing)

1135
01:25:27.611 --> 01:25:32.611
(water splashing)
(dramatic music)

1136
01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:46.563
My darling Jack.

1137
01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:51.543
By the time you read this letter.
I will have left Sorrento.

1138
01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:55.150
I could not bring myself to say

1139
01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:56.763
these words in person to you.

1140
01:25:58.330 --> 01:26:01.663
These are the hardest words
that I have ever written.

1141
01:26:03.330 --> 01:26:06.090
Now that you have heard what I had done.

1142
01:26:06.090 --> 01:26:07.863
You know. everything that I am.

1143
01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:11.770
Jack you'll never knew how sorry I am

1144
01:26:12.893 --> 01:26:14.823
but I need you to be strong.

1145
01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.503
The suitcase is in the closet

1146
01:26:17.503 --> 01:26:19.703
and the key is underneath my bed.

1147
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:24.903
Now. you know where it is
and the lies it contains.

1148
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:30.390
What you do with this
information is up to you my love.

1149
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:33.623
No one else knows.

1150
01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:36.960
This is now you're choice.

1151
01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.690
(dramatic music)

1152
01:26:38.690 --> 01:26:40.173
I know I'm not perfect.

1153
01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:43.093
And I know I have failed you.

1154
01:26:44.830 --> 01:26:47.550
One day I pray that I will be forgiven

1155
01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:52.770
but for now. I have told you the truth

1156
01:26:54.273 --> 01:26:56.993
and that is all I can do.

1157
01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.430
All my love. mother.
