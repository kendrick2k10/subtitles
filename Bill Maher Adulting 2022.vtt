00:12:46.934 --> 00:12:48.634
I MEAN. DOCTORS.

376
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:49.634
DOCTORS USED TO DO CIGARETTE

377
00:12:49.701 --> 00:12:51.400
ADS.

378
00:12:51.467 --> 00:12:52.634
I'M NOT KIDDING.

00:12:52.701 --> 00:12:57.567
YOU CAN LOOK... LOOK UP AN OLD

I SWEAR YOU CAN FIND THAT.

384
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.801
THEY USED TO PUT HEROIN IN COUGH

385
00:13:07.868 --> 00:13:09.601
MEDICINE AND COCAINE IN SOFT

386
00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:11.701
DRINKS.

387
00:13:11.767 --> 00:13:16.267
THAT WAS NOT A BAD IDEA.

389
00:13:17.734 --> 00:13:20.868

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.534
JUST FUCKING THROW IT OUT THE

00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:29.801
WINDOW.

394
00:13:29.868 --> 00:13:31.109
[LAUGHTER]
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS WRONG.

395
00:13:31.133 --> 00:13:32.844
AND THEN THEY MADE THE
COMMERCIAL WITH THE CRYING

396
00:13:32.868 --> 00:13:34.334
INDIAN. AND WE WERE LIKE.

397
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.710
OH. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT MADE
INDIANS CRY.

398
00:13:35.734 --> 00:13:39.100
I'M SORRY.

399
00:13:39.167 --> 00:13:40.276
[LAUGHTER]
WE DON'T HAVE TO THROW SHIT OUT

400
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:40.667
THE WINDOW.

401
00:13:40.734 --> 00:13:42.634
AND WE STOPPED. YOU KNOW?

402
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:44.200
I MEAN. MY MOTHER DRANK DURING

403
00:13:44.267 --> 00:13:45.634
HER PREGNANCY. AND I CAME OUT

404
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:47.133
PERFECTLY NORMAL.

405
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.801

406
00:13:51.868 --> 00:13:52.877
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WAIT.

407
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:57.334
WHY IS THAT FUNNY?

408
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.133
AND I MUST SAY ON THAT SCORE. I

409
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.200
HAVE SEEN THIS A COUPLE OF TIMES

410
00:14:01.267 --> 00:14:02.701
IN A RESTAURANT.

411
00:14:02.767 --> 00:14:04.100
A PREGNANT WOMAN IS HAVING

412
00:14:04.167 --> 00:14:05.834
DINNER. DRINKING A GLASS OF

413
00:14:05.901 --> 00:14:08.500
WINE. AND SOME STRANGER WILL

414
00:14:08.567 --> 00:14:09.710
COME OVER AND SCOLD HER. OKAY.

415
00:14:09.734 --> 00:14:10.400
THIS BULLSHIT HAS TO STOP IN

416
00:14:10.467 --> 00:14:11.901
AMERICA.

417
00:14:11.968 --> 00:14:14.500
THE SNITCHES AND BITCHES COUNTRY

418
00:14:14.567 --> 00:14:19.100
WE LIVE IN.

419
00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:20.376
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MIND YOUR OWN FUCKING BUSINESS.

420
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.267

422
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.000
AND I BET YOU THE PERSON WHO'S

423
00:14:25.067 --> 00:14:26.601
DOING THE SCOLDING WAS

424
00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:27.801
PRO-CHOICE.

425
00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:29.434
AND I'M PRO-CHOICE.

426
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.601
BUT I GET THE OTHER ARGUMENT.

427
00:14:31.667 --> 00:14:33.834
YOU KNOW. I DON'T THINK A FETUS

428
00:14:33.901 --> 00:14:34.910
IS LIFE. BUT IT'S UNDENIABLY

429
00:14:34.934 --> 00:14:37.334
BECOMING A LIFE.

430
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.601
SO WHAT. YOU'RE OKAY WITH

431
00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:39.234
KILLING IT. BUT NOT GETTING IT A

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.667

438
00:14:54.267 --> 00:14:55.767
SO YES. LINCOLN SAID SOME RACIST

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.420
SO DID EVERY WHITE PERSON IN

442
00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:02.634
COLUMBUS HAD SLAVES.

443
00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:05.033
SO DID EVERYONE IN 1492 WHO

444
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.300
COULD AFFORD IT. INCLUDING

445
00:15:07.367 --> 00:15:08.934

00:15:22.234 --> 00:15:23.500
REPRESENTED. SIR.

455
00:15:23.567 --> 00:15:26.100
I AGREE WITH YOU.

456
00:15:26.167 --> 00:15:27.400
NOT AN APPLAUSE BREAK. MY

00:15:39.434 --> 00:15:40.734
EVERYONE IN THE BIBLE.

462
00:15:40.801 --> 00:15:42.701

[LAUGHTER]

469
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.300
BOTH TESTAMENTS HAVE LOTS OF

470
00:16:01.367 --> 00:16:03.133
RULES AND LAWS ABOUT SLAVERY.

471
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.376
AND NONE OF THEM ARE. DON'T DO

472
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.133
IT.

473
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.400
THAT NEVER CROSSED THEIR MIND.

474
00:16:07.434 --> 00:16:08.767
DON'T DO IT.

475
00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:10.400
THERE'S A LOT OF LAWS. LIKE IF A

476
00:16:10.467 --> 00:16:11.976
MAN KILLS YOUR SLAVE. YOU MAY
KILL HIS SLAVE.

477
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.868
OKAY.

478
00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:17.934
THIS IS NOT A DEFENSE OF

479
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.400
SLAVERY.

480
00:16:19.467 --> 00:16:21.000
IT'S JUST SAYING. YOU KNOW.

481
00:16:21.067 --> 00:16:22.076
WHATEVER AGE YOU LIVE IN. YOU

482
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.140

STOP FLATTERING YOURSELF THAT

00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:26.710
YOU'RE NOSTRADAMUS AND YOU WOULD

485
00:16:26.734 --> 00:16:27.810
HAVE KNOWN THINGS WERE WRONG AT

486
00:16:27.834 --> 00:16:28.767
A TIME WHEN NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT

487
00:16:28.834 --> 00:16:29.868
THAT.

488
00:16:29.934 --> 00:16:32.234

489
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.734
YEARS AGO. YOU'D BE LIKE. WELL.

490
00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:34.968
SLAVERY IS WRONG AND GAY AND

491
00:16:35.033 --> 00:16:36.100
TRANS PEOPLE SHOULD BE

492
00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:36.968

EVERYDAY LIFE.

IT'S IN ALL MUSIC. YOU KNOW.

535
00:18:09.234 --> 00:18:12.100
LIKE EARLY ROCK AND ROLL. '50s.

AND IT WAS JUST WHAT PEOPLE DID.

545
00:18:30.634 --> 00:18:32.434
EVEN WHEN I STARTED LISTENING TO

546
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.300

556
00:18:52.934 --> 00:18:58.801

OH. YES. THAT'S RIGHT. GOD.

699
00:23:48.367 --> 00:23:49.667

TO MAKE FUN OF RELIGION.

712
00:24:11.567 --> 00:24:16.500
I...

713
00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:18.200
[LAUGHTER]

714
00:24:18.267 --> 00:24:19.543

OH. I THINK YOU'RE CONFUSING ME

715
00:24:19.567 --> 00:24:21.067
WITH ANOTHER COMEDIAN.

716
00:24:21.133 --> 00:24:22.634
BUT NO. I HAVE MADE RELIGION A

717
00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:24.434
THEME OF MY CAREER. ALTHOUGH I

718
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.434
WOULD HARDLY SAY I'M NOT AN

719
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.033
EXPERT IN CHRISTIANITY.

720
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.500
I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN ISLAM.

721
00:24:30.567 --> 00:24:33.000
I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN JUDAISM.

722
00:24:33.067 --> 00:24:33.667
ALTHOUGH I TRY NEVER TO PAY

723
00:24:33.734 --> 00:24:35.500

724
00:24:35.567 --> 00:24:40.567
[LAUGHTER]

725
00:24:40.634 --> 00:24:42.334
BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU. ALL THESE

726
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.701
YEARS MAKING FUN OF RELIGION. I

727
00:24:44.767 --> 00:24:46.500
KIND OF HAD IT WRONG BECAUSE I

728
00:24:46.567 --> 00:24:48.167
ALWAYS WAS ASKING THE QUESTION.

729
00:24:48.234 --> 00:24:50.968
HOW CAN OTHERWISE INTELLIGENT

730
00:24:51.033 --> 00:24:53.634
PEOPLE LIKE WALL OFF A PART OF

731
00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:55.634
THEIR MIND AND BELIEVE STUFF

732
00:24:55.701 --> 00:25:00.234
THAT THEY MUST KNOW IN THE OTHER

733
00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.677
PART OF THEIR MIND IS NONSENSE?
AND I DIDN'T GET IT. FAITH.

734
00:25:01.701 --> 00:25:03.000
IT'S NOT A BUG. IT'S A FEATURE.

735
00:25:03.067 --> 00:25:04.868
THEY LIKE THAT.

736
00:25:04.934 --> 00:25:06.868
THE STUPIDER IT IS. THE BETTER.

737
00:25:06.934 --> 00:25:08.234
BECAUSE THAT PROVES THEIR FAITH

738
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:08.934
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM FEEL

739
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.968
GOOD.

740
00:25:11.033 --> 00:25:12.834
THAT'S WHY AMERICANS. YOU KNOW

741
00:25:12.901 --> 00:25:14.234

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.200
ALL THE BIBLE CHARACTERS THE

MOST. NOAH.

744
00:25:17.834 --> 00:25:21.133
AMERICANS LOVE THEM SOME NOAH

745
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:21.667
BECAUSE... BECAUSE HE'S A

746
00:25:21.734 --> 00:25:23.500
MAN OF FAITH.

747
00:25:23.567 --> 00:25:26.434
BECAUSE HE IS GIVEN AN ORDER BY

748
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.580
GOD. GOD SAYS. I'M GOING TO

749
00:25:27.634 --> 00:25:29.434
FUCKING KILL EVERYTHING IN THIS

750
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.701
PLANET.

751
00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:33.877
[LAUGHTER]
I'M GOING TO DROWN EVERY LAST

752
00:25:33.901 --> 00:25:36.100
ONE OF YOU MOTHERFUCKERS.

753
00:25:36.167 --> 00:25:37.701
AND NOAH DOES NOT SAY. THAT'S A

754
00:25:37.767 --> 00:25:41.300
TERRIBLE IDEA.

755
00:25:41.367 --> 00:25:41.567
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S... NO.

756
00:25:42.133 --> 00:25:43.733
NOAH'S LIKE. I'M ON IT. BOSS.
GREAT IDEA.

757
00:25:43.901 --> 00:25:45.101
LET'S BUILD A BOAT.
YOU GOT IT.

758
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.968
40 CUBITS.

759
00:25:47.033 --> 00:25:47.767
I AM ON MY WAY TO HOME DEPOT

760
00:25:47.834 --> 00:25:51.300
RIGHT NOW. SIR.

761
00:25:51.367 --> 00:25:51.567
[LAUGHTER]

762
00:25:51.634 --> 00:25:53.300
I'M... YOU KNOW... HE JUST...

763
00:25:53.367 --> 00:25:54.701
[LAUGHTER]

764
00:25:54.767 --> 00:25:55.901
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE MOST

765
00:25:55.968 --> 00:25:57.328
FUCKED UP PART OF THAT BIBLE
STORY.

766
00:25:57.801 --> 00:25:58.267
STORY.

767
00:25:58.334 --> 00:26:01.801
IT'S IN THE BIBLE.

768
00:26:01.868 --> 00:26:05.934
THE MOST FUCKED UP PART IS AFTER

769
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.367
THE FLOOD. GOD TALKS TO NOAH

770
00:26:07.434 --> 00:26:10.234
AGAIN. THIS TIME BECAUSE HE

771
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.620
FEELS BAD ABOUT KILLING
EVERYBODY.

772
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.601
[LAUGHTER]

773
00:26:15.667 --> 00:26:17.701
SO GOD IS THIS ORB OF PERFECT

774
00:26:17.767 --> 00:26:19.234
ENERGY. THE SUPER UBER RULER OF

775
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.734
THE UNIVERSE.

776
00:26:20.801 --> 00:26:21.534
BUT HE FEELS LIKE SHIT WHEN HE

777
00:26:21.601 --> 00:26:23.834
FUCKS UP.

778
00:26:23.901 --> 00:26:25.200
THIS IS SO INTERESTING. AND WE

779
00:26:25.267 --> 00:26:26.834
KNOW HE DOES FEEL THIS WAY

780
00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:28.934
BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS THIS WAS

781
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.210
THE MOMENT THAT GOD CREATED THE

782
00:26:30.234 --> 00:26:32.868
RAINBOW.

783
00:26:32.934 --> 00:26:35.434
BEFORE THIS. NO RAINBOWS.

784
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.634
GOD CREATED THE RAINBOW AS A

785
00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:39.701
GIFT TO NOAH. A SYMPATHY

786
00:26:39.767 --> 00:26:41.601
PRESENT. A KIND OF A... I'M NOT

787
00:26:41.667 --> 00:26:42.987
MAKING... LOOK. IT'S IN THE
BIBLE.

788
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.601
I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP.

789
00:26:44.667 --> 00:26:46.300
HE FELT BAD.

790
00:26:46.367 --> 00:26:47.476
HE WAS LIKE. NOAH. I FEEL LIKE

791
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.500
I'M SUCH A DICK.

792
00:26:48.534 --> 00:26:52.701
THAT WAS SUCH A DICK MOVE.

793
00:26:52.767 --> 00:26:52.968
[LAUGHTER]
I... I DROWNED BABIES.

794
00:26:53.534 --> 00:26:54.167
DIDN'T I?

795
00:26:54.234 --> 00:26:56.234
I DROWNED BABIES.

796
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.334
I... I SHOULDN'T DRINK.

797
00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.267
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

798
00:27:00.334 --> 00:27:00.534
[LAUGHTER]
I SHOULDN'T DRINK.

799
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.677
I'M A NICE GOD.
AND THEN I TURN INTO THIS

800
00:27:02.701 --> 00:27:04.868
ASSHOLE.

801
00:27:04.934 --> 00:27:06.234
ANYWAY. I FEEL TERRIBLE.

802
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.200
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

803
00:27:09.267 --> 00:27:09.801
BRING IT IN. FELLAS.

804
00:27:09.868 --> 00:27:11.734
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS.

805
00:27:11.801 --> 00:27:12.300
IT'S... I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS

806
00:27:12.367 --> 00:27:13.467
BEFORE.

807
00:27:13.534 --> 00:27:16.167
TILT IT.

808
00:27:16.234 --> 00:27:17.868
IT'S A... TILT IT... IS THAT

809
00:27:17.934 --> 00:27:19.033
GORGEOUS?

810
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.567
THAT'S A RAINBOW.

811
00:27:21.634 --> 00:27:22.743
[LAUGHTER]
THAT IS A RAINBOW.

812
00:27:22.767 --> 00:27:24.476
YOU'RE GOING TO... IT'S GOING TO
MAKE THIS PLACE POP.

813
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.267
YOU WERE GOING TO LOVE THIS

814
00:27:25.334 --> 00:27:26.734

817
00:27:28.667 --> 00:27:30.534
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

818
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:32.167
IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER. ENJOY.

819
00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:34.033
ENJOY. ENJOY. JUST DON'T DO

820
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:38.801
ANYTHING GAY WITH IT.

821
00:27:38.868 --> 00:27:39.567
[LAUGHTER]

822
00:27:39.634 --> 00:27:41.000
THAT'S...

823
00:27:41.067 --> 00:27:41.667

824
00:27:41.734 --> 00:27:43.968
OH. WE KID.

829
00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:50.801
ABOUT RELIGION THESE DAYS

830
00:27:50.868 --> 00:27:52.567
IS THAT IT'S SORT OF LIKE

831
00:27:52.634 --> 00:27:54.701
CROSS-POLLINATING WITH POLITICS.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

844
00:28:17.968 --> 00:28:19.410
WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A
CONSPIRACY THEORY PROBLEM IN

845
00:28:19.434 --> 00:28:20.467
THIS COUNTRY.

846
00:28:20.534 --> 00:28:22.968
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHO DID NOT

00:28:24.367 --> 00:28:26.701
JEFFREY EPSTEIN. I THINK. USED

849
00:28:26.767 --> 00:28:28.767
TO LIVE HERE IN THIS AREA.

850
00:28:28.834 --> 00:28:30.968
[LAUGHTER]

851
00:28:31.033 --> 00:28:32.467
YOU KNOW. BECAUSE BY RUNNING A

00:28:32.534 --> 00:28:34.033
PEDOPHILE RING FOR THE WORLD'S

853
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.767
ELITE. IT JUST YOU KNOW. IT JUST

854
00:28:37.834 --> 00:28:38.944
LOOKED BAD TO THE PEOPLE... TO

855
00:28:38.968 --> 00:28:43.167
THE PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THAT

856
00:28:43.234 --> 00:28:44.376
MAYBE THE WORLD'S ELITE.
YOU KNOW. WE'RE RUNNING A

857
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.400
PEDOPHILE RING.

858
00:28:48.467 --> 00:28:48.667
[LAUGHTER]
I'M JUST... I'M NOT SAYING

859
00:28:49.434 --> 00:28:50.643
THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON.
IT JUST LOOKED BAD.

860
00:28:50.667 --> 00:28:51.901
BUT CAN YOU... CAN YOU BLAME

861
00:28:51.968 --> 00:28:53.634
AMERICANS. YOU KNOW. FOR BEING

862
00:28:53.701 --> 00:28:56.133
TURNED OFF TO POLITICS?

863
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.267
I MEAN. HALF THE COUNTRY THINKS

864
00:28:58.334 --> 00:29:02.400
THAT THE OPPOSITION PARTY EATS

865
00:29:02.467 --> 00:29:03.710
BABIES. AND THE OTHER HALF WANTS

866
00:29:03.734 --> 00:29:09.467
TO CANCEL DR. SEUSS.

867
00:29:09.534 --> 00:29:09.734
[LAUGHTER]

868
00:29:09.801 --> 00:29:10.841
YOU KNOW. WHERE DO YOU GO?

869
00:29:10.868 --> 00:29:11.767
AND LOOK. I WORRY ABOUT THE

870
00:29:11.834 --> 00:29:13.133
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THE SHIT THAT

871
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.434
THEY DO THAT PISSES OFF VOTERS

872
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.067
STRIKES A LOT CLOSER TO HOME.

873
00:29:17.133 --> 00:29:18.934
YOU KNOW. YOU HEARD ME.

874
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.400
I HAPPEN TO THINK THE TWO

875
00:29:21.467 --> 00:29:22.834
BIGGEST ISSUES OF OUR TIME ARE

876
00:29:22.901 --> 00:29:24.400
THE ENVIRONMENT AND DEMOCRACY.

877
00:29:24.467 --> 00:29:26.067
BUT...

878
00:29:26.133 --> 00:29:29.400
[APPLAUSE]

879
00:29:29.467 --> 00:29:30.367
GOOD.

880
00:29:30.434 --> 00:29:32.567
I'M GLAD I'M NOT ALONE.

881
00:29:32.634 --> 00:29:33.434
BUT. YOU KNOW. I DON'T HAVE

882
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.868
KIDS.

883
00:29:34.934 --> 00:29:36.634
TO A LOT OF KIDS. TO A LOT OF

884
00:29:36.701 --> 00:29:38.667
PEOPLE. RATHER. IT'S KIDS AND

885
00:29:38.734 --> 00:29:40.400
SCHOOLS.

886
00:29:40.467 --> 00:29:42.167
I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY.

887
00:29:42.234 --> 00:29:43.667
BROUGHT IT HOME TO ME. I WAS

889
00:29:46.267 --> 00:29:47.200

890
00:29:47.267 --> 00:29:49.434
SEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER NOW.

891
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.834
AND FOR SOME REASON I WAS

892
00:29:50.901 --> 00:29:53.434
TELLING HER ABOUT THE TIME WHEN

893
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.400
I WAS SEVEN AND I WAS SITTING IN

894
00:29:54.467 --> 00:29:55.968
MY FIRST GRADE CLASS AND MY

895
00:29:56.033 --> 00:29:56.767
FATHER SUDDENLY APPEARED AT THE

896
00:29:56.834 --> 00:29:58.167

897
00:29:58.234 --> 00:29:59.100
I WAS LIKE. WHOA. WHAT THE FUCK

[LAUGHTER]
WHAT...

900
00:30:01.767 --> 00:30:03.167
BUT HE WAS THERE TO TAKE ME OUT

901
00:30:03.234 --> 00:30:04.167
OF SCHOOL TO GO TO MY FIRST

902
00:30:04.234 --> 00:30:05.367
BASEBALL GAME.

903
00:30:05.434 --> 00:30:06.033
YEAH. I KNOW.

904
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.267
IT WAS A GREAT MEMORY.

905
00:30:08.334 --> 00:30:09.443
AND SHE SAID TO ME. OH. COULDN'T

906
00:30:09.467 --> 00:30:10.467
DO THAT.

907
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.510
I WAS LIKE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

908
00:30:11.534 --> 00:30:12.610
SHE SAID. I CAN'T JUST WALK INTO

909
00:30:12.634 --> 00:30:13.434
MY SCHOOL.

910
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.567
WHAT?

911
00:30:14.634 --> 00:30:15.934
SHE SAID. NO. YOU HAVE TO CALL

913
00:30:17.267 --> 00:30:20.100
THE PERSON. PROVIDE A REASON FOR

914
00:30:20.167 --> 00:30:23.200
YOUR OWN KID. HOW ABOUT SHE

915
00:30:23.267 --> 00:30:25.234
CRAWLED OUT OF MY VAGINA AS A...

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.467
[LAUGHTER]

917
00:30:26.534 --> 00:30:30.067
HOW ABOUT THAT REASON?

918
00:30:30.133 --> 00:30:31.367
[APPLAUSE]

919
00:30:31.434 --> 00:30:32.534
I MEAN. THERE ARE PEOPLE IN

920
00:30:32.601 --> 00:30:33.467
CALIFORNIA WHO WANT TO REMOVE

921
00:30:33.534 --> 00:30:34.734
SEX COMPLETELY FROM THE BIRTH

922
00:30:34.801 --> 00:30:37.434
CERTIFICATE.

923
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.701
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BOY.

924
00:30:39.767 --> 00:30:41.367
YOU HAD A HUMAN WITH A PENIS.

925
00:30:41.434 --> 00:30:43.467
WHETHER THAT'S A BOY IS... AT

926
00:30:43.534 --> 00:30:47.968
BEST. A MAYBE.

927
00:30:48.033 --> 00:30:48.234
[LAUGHTER]
LET'S WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE THREE

NO. NO. NO. NO.

1111
00:36:37.167 --> 00:36:39.234
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY IT.

1112
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.834
I ALWAYS GO TOO FAR.

1113
00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:47.500
BUT REALLY. I MEAN. IF ONE SIDE

1114
00:36:47.567 --> 00:36:50.801
IN THIS COUNTRY HAS ALL THE GUNS

1115
00:36:50.868 --> 00:36:55.100
AND ONE SIDE HAS ALL THE POT.

1116
00:36:55.167 --> 00:36:56.534
YOU KNOW. LIBERALS. WHEN THE

1117
00:36:56.601 --> 00:36:58.000
CIVIL WAR COMES. YOU'RE GOING TO

1118
00:36:58.067 --> 00:37:00.000
GET YOUR ASS KICKED LIKE THE

1119
00:37:00.067 --> 00:37:05.200
WHITE KID AT A SPELLING BEE.

1120
00:37:05.267 --> 00:37:05.467
[LAUGHTER]

1121
00:37:05.534 --> 00:37:07.167
BUT THIS IS... THIS IS A BIG

1122
00:37:07.234 --> 00:37:09.634
COUNTRY. A VERY BIG COUNTRY WITH

1123
00:37:09.701 --> 00:37:10.877
LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T THINK

1124
00:37:10.901 --> 00:37:12.200
LIKE YOU. NO MATTER HOW YOU

1125
00:37:12.267 --> 00:37:14.100
THINK. AND YOU CAN'T OWN THEM

1126
00:37:14.167 --> 00:37:15.467
OR DESTROY THEM AND THEY'RE NOT

1127
00:37:15.534 --> 00:37:16.677
GOING TO SELF DEPORT NO MATTER

1128
00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:18.567
WHO WINS ELECTIONS.

1129
00:37:18.634 --> 00:37:20.033
WE HAVE TO FIND OUR WAY BACK

1130
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.801
FROM NOT LOATHING EACH OTHER.

1131
00:37:23.868 --> 00:37:25.801
I MEAN. WE HAVE THE PHENOMENON

1132
00:37:25.868 --> 00:37:28.000
NOW OF POLITICAL DIVORCES.

1133
00:37:28.067 --> 00:37:29.868
PEOPLE GETTING DIVORCES OVER

1134
00:37:29.934 --> 00:37:32.467
THEIR POLITICS ARE DIFFERENT.

1135
00:37:32.534 --> 00:37:34.167
SOMETIMES BROTHERS AND SISTERS

1136
00:37:34.234 --> 00:37:36.200
STOP TALKING TO EACH OTHER.

1137
00:37:36.267 --> 00:37:37.510
WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

1138
00:37:37.534 --> 00:37:39.300
GET LAID IN THE PANHANDLE.

1139
00:37:39.367 --> 00:37:42.300
[LAUGHTER]

1140
00:37:42.367 --> 00:37:50.367
OH. I ALMOST GOT THROUGH THAT.

00:37:50.734 --> 00:37:52.901
I KID.

1142
00:37:52.968 --> 00:37:55.634
I KID THE REDNECKS.

1143
00:37:55.701 --> 00:37:59.934
I... NO. SEE BAD ME.

1144
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.334
MEA CULPA. I KNOW I REALLY I

1145
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.033
HAVE BEEN LESS THAN RESPECTFUL

1146
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.868
IN MY CAREER.

1147
00:38:03.934 --> 00:38:05.743
I HAVE USED WORDS LIKE "REDNECK"
AND "SHIT KICKER" AND "SNAKE

1148
00:38:05.767 --> 00:38:09.133
HANDLER" AND "MOUTH BREATHER."

1149
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.634
"FLAT EARTHER." "BIBLE THUMPER."

1150
00:38:10.701 --> 00:38:13.868

1151
00:38:13.934 --> 00:38:14.934
"RUBCRETE." AND "INBRED."

1152
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.434
"SLINGBLADE." "PAINT CHIP

CORN."

1156
00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:27.200
I HAVE. AND I FEEL TERRIBLE.

1157
00:38:27.267 --> 00:38:29.167
BUT YOU KNOW. IN MY DEFENSE.

1158
00:38:29.234 --> 00:38:30.834
IT'S SOMETIMES THEY MAKE IT VERY

1159
00:38:30.901 --> 00:38:31.267
HARD NOT TO DO THAT.

1160
00:38:31.334 --> 00:38:33.234
[LAUGHTER]

1161
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.033
I WAS READING AN ARTICLE

1162
00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.834

00:38:36.901 --> 00:38:38.634

00:38:42.434 --> 00:38:43.667
SWEAR TO GOD.

YES.

1168
00:38:45.534 --> 00:38:46.133

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.067
[LAUGHTER]

1170
00:38:49.133 --> 00:38:50.567
AND THAT WASN'T EVEN THE

1171
00:38:50.634 --> 00:38:52.234
SCARIEST PART OF THAT ARTICLE.

1172
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.400
THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF

1173
00:38:55.467 --> 00:38:56.476
PARAGRAPH THREE. WHICH SAID

1174
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.267
OPPONENTS OF THE BILL.

1176
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.300
OPPONENTS OF THE BILL.

PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T ROCK AND

1178
00:39:07.334 --> 00:39:08.443
MEDDLE IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

1179
00:39:08.467 --> 00:39:10.000
GETTING IN BETWEEN ME AND THE

I SAID. MIGHT. I DIDN'T.

1182
00:39:15.367 --> 00:39:16.567
AND THAT'S THE THING.

1183
00:39:16.634 --> 00:39:18.000
I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT THE

1184
00:39:18.067 --> 00:39:19.210
PEOPLE OF KENTUCKY ARE CHICKEN

1185
00:39:19.234 --> 00:39:21.767
FUCKERS. BUT THEY WANT THE

AMERICA. THEY LOVE THEIR

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:32.467
FREEDOM.

1191
00:39:32.534 --> 00:39:33.577
THAT'S WHAT FLORIDA HAS GOT

1192
00:39:33.601 --> 00:39:35.234
GOING FOR IT. RIGHT?

1193
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.968

00:39:55.701 --> 00:39:57.667
SON.

1203
00:39:57.734 --> 00:39:59.400

I HAVEN'T LIVED EVERYWHERE ELSE.

1218
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:22.567
MAYBE IT IS.

1219
00:40:22.634 --> 00:40:23.801
MAYBE IT ISN'T.

00:40:25.934 --> 00:40:27.009
SHOULDN'T THAT BE ENOUGH?
IT'S SO CHILDISH.

00:40:29.667 --> 00:40:30.968
I WAS THINKING THAT. LIKE NOW.

1224
00:40:31.033 --> 00:40:32.534
LIKE WHEN I'M ON THE ROAD

1225
00:40:32.601 --> 00:40:33.834
BECAUSE I'M IN A HOTEL AND I

1226
00:40:33.901 --> 00:40:35.076
WANT FRESH AIR AND I CAN NEVER

GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

BUT IF WE DON'T SEAL THE WINDOW

1231
00:40:42.234 --> 00:40:46.801

00:42:23.667 --> 00:42:24.667
IT WAS A FUNDRAISER.

1291
00:42:24.734 --> 00:42:26.267
HE WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT.

1292
00:42:26.334 --> 00:42:28.267
HE SHOWED UP TO HELP SOMEBODY.

1293
00:42:28.334 --> 00:42:30.901
THE WOMAN WHO WAS INTRODUCING

1294
00:42:30.968 --> 00:42:31.667
HIM. HE WAS JUST TRYING TO SHOW

1295
00:42:31.734 --> 00:42:33.767
SOME SUPPORT.

1296
00:42:33.834 --> 00:42:38.300
SMELL THE BENGAY.

1297
00:42:38.367 --> 00:42:38.567
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S JUST... SHE WAS ABOUT TO...

1298
00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:39.834
SHE WAS WAITING IN THE WINGS.

1299
00:42:39.901 --> 00:42:42.167
AND HE CAME UP BEHIND HER.

1300
00:42:42.234 --> 00:42:44.667
"YOU'RE GOING TO DO GREAT.

1301
00:42:44.734 --> 00:42:45.734
HONEY."
[LAUGHTER]

1302
00:42:45.801 --> 00:42:47.901
THAT'S IT.

1303
00:42:47.968 --> 00:42:49.367
I MEAN... HERE. LET ME RECITE TO

1304
00:42:49.434 --> 00:42:51.067
YOU. THESE ARE HER EXACT WORDS

1305
00:42:51.133 --> 00:42:52.143
BECAUSE SHE WROTE A BLOG ABOUT

1306
00:42:52.167 --> 00:42:54.434
IT FIVE YEARS LATER.

1307
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.734
SHE SAID. "I FELT TWO HANDS ON

1308
00:42:55.801 --> 00:42:59.500
MY SHOULDERS AND FROZE."

1309
00:42:59.567 --> 00:43:00.234
OKAY. YOU'RE AUTISTIC THEN.

1310
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.400
THAT'S ALL LIKE...

1311
00:43:01.467 --> 00:43:02.901
[LAUGHTER]

1312
00:43:02.968 --> 00:43:06.634
THAT'S AN AUTISTIC PERSON.

1313
00:43:06.701 --> 00:43:07.334
WHY IS THE VICE PRESIDENT

1314
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.434
TOUCHING ME?

1315
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.634
I DON'T KNOW.

1316
00:43:10.701 --> 00:43:11.834
BECAUSE HE'S HUMAN.

1317
00:43:11.901 --> 00:43:13.834
SOMETIMES HUMANS DO THAT.

1318
00:43:13.901 --> 00:43:15.109
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO RUN AND

1319
00:43:15.133 --> 00:43:15.934
GET THE RAPE KIT JUST YET. YOU

1320
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.234
KNOW?

1321
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:23.934
[APPLAUSE]

1322
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.033
HE KISSED THE BACK OF MY HEAD.

1323
00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:27.334
MY BRAIN COULDN'T PROCESS WHAT

1324
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.734
WAS HAPPENING.

1325
00:43:28.801 --> 00:43:30.133
[LAUGHTER]

1326
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.367
REALLY?

1327
00:43:32.434 --> 00:43:33.000
YOU COULDN'T.

1328
00:43:33.067 --> 00:43:34.076
YOUR BRAIN COULDN'T PROCESS

1329
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:34.934
THAT. LIKE STRING THEORY OR

1330
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
WORMHOLES.

1331
00:43:38.067 --> 00:43:38.767
I WAS EMBARRASSED. SHOCKED.

1332
00:43:38.834 --> 00:43:40.767
CONFUSED.

1333
00:43:40.834 --> 00:43:42.367
OKAY. THEN THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS

1334
00:43:42.434 --> 00:43:47.133
NOT FOR YOU.

1335
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.443
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S... I'M NOT... I'M NOT
TRYING TO BE MEAN.

1336
00:43:48.467 --> 00:43:49.067
DON'T GET IT TWISTED.

1337
00:43:49.133 --> 00:43:50.176
THIS IS NOT A CRITIQUE OF WOMEN.

1338
00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.743
THIS IS A DEFENSE.
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK MOST WOMEN

1339
00:43:51.767 --> 00:43:53.033
ARE LIKE THIS.

1340
00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.777
I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE
REPUTATION THEY WANT OR DESERVE.

1341
00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:58.133
YOU KNOW.

1342
00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.100
[APPLAUSE]

1343
00:44:00.167 --> 00:44:02.667
I THINK THEY'RE MADE OF STERNER

1344
00:44:02.734 --> 00:44:02.868
STUFF.
BERNIE SANDERS HAD THE EXACT

1345
00:44:03.634 --> 00:44:04.968
SAME THING HAPPEN TO HIM.

1346
00:44:05.033 --> 00:44:06.334
AS SOON AS HE ANNOUNCED. HIS

1347
00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.167
CAMPAIGN WAS ALMOST DERAILED

1348
00:44:08.234 --> 00:44:10.500
BECAUSE A WOMAN CAME FORWARD TO

1349
00:44:10.567 --> 00:44:12.267
TALK ABOUT THE TIME ON THE

1350
00:44:12.334 --> 00:44:14.968
CAMPAIGN WHEN SHE WAS ASKED TO

1351
00:44:15.033 --> 00:44:17.200
SPEND A NIGHT ONCE WITH THREE

1352
00:44:17.267 --> 00:44:19.901
MALE MEMBERS OF THE CAMPAIGN.

1353
00:44:19.968 --> 00:44:21.534
OKAY. IT'S A CAMPAIGN.

1354
00:44:21.601 --> 00:44:22.701
IT'S A REVOLUTION.

1355
00:44:22.767 --> 00:44:24.133
IT'S A SHOESTRING BUDGET.

1356
00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.360
NOT EVERYBODY GETS A SUITE AT

1357
00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.434
THE RITZ.

1358
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.100
THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID. LITERALLY

1359
00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:30.601
WORD FOR WORD.

1360
00:44:30.667 --> 00:44:33.601
SHE SAID. I WAS SHAKING WITH

1361
00:44:33.667 --> 00:44:34.801
FEAR. LITERALLY.

1362
00:44:34.868 --> 00:44:36.009
I REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF.

1363
00:44:36.033 --> 00:44:39.000
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

1364
00:44:39.067 --> 00:44:40.634
GO TO SLEEP.

1365
00:44:40.701 --> 00:44:42.901
[LAUGHTER]

1366
00:44:42.968 --> 00:44:45.601
LITERALLY GO TO SLEEP.

1367
00:44:45.667 --> 00:44:49.601
I MEAN. THERE ARE THREE NERDS ON

1368
00:44:49.667 --> 00:44:50.300
THE BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN.

1369
00:44:50.367 --> 00:44:53.267
THEY'RE NOT ESCAPED CONVICTS.

1370
00:44:53.334 --> 00:44:54.543
IF YOU CAME OUT OF THE BATHROOM

1371
00:44:54.567 --> 00:44:56.043
WITH JUST A BRA AND PANTIES ON.
THEY'D PROBABLY SHIT THEIR

1372
00:44:56.067 --> 00:44:57.200
PANTS.

1373
00:44:57.267 --> 00:45:01.534
[LAUGHTER]

1374
00:45:01.601 --> 00:45:02.300
I MEAN. WHO RAISED THESE

1375
00:45:02.367 --> 00:45:04.167
JELLYFISH?

1376
00:45:04.234 --> 00:45:05.343
THIS CANNOT BE THE IMAGE WOMEN

1377
00:45:05.367 --> 00:45:07.934
WANT OR DESERVE.

1378
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:08.500
YOU KNOW. I MEAN. YES. IT'S

1379
00:45:08.567 --> 00:45:09.567
GREAT.

1380
00:45:09.601 --> 00:45:11.367
WE HAD A RECKONING. BUT SOME

1381
00:45:11.434 --> 00:45:13.167
STUFF WOMEN. I'M SURE. AND I

1382
00:45:13.234 --> 00:45:14.067
KNOW MOST WOMEN CAN'T JUST

1383
00:45:14.133 --> 00:45:15.434
HANDLE YOURSELF.

1384
00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.267
IF AN OLD MAN COMES UP BEHIND

1385
00:45:17.334 --> 00:45:18.133
YOU. INSTEAD OF WAITING FIVE

1386
00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.334
YEARS AND WRITING A BLOG.

1387
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.033
HOW ABOUT JUST TURNING AROUND?

1388
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.567
"EXCUSE ME. MR. VICE PRESIDENT.

1389
00:45:24.634 --> 00:45:25.467
I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO MAKE A

1390
00:45:25.534 --> 00:45:27.100
SPEECH.

1391
00:45:27.167 --> 00:45:27.968
I'M GETTING MY HEAD TOGETHER.

1392
00:45:28.033 --> 00:45:29.210
YOU CAN KISS THE BACK OF MY HEAD

1393
00:45:29.234 --> 00:45:30.234
LATER. YOU KNOW?"

1394
00:45:30.267 --> 00:45:34.634
[LAUGHTER]

1395
00:45:34.701 --> 00:45:35.100
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

1396
00:45:35.167 --> 00:45:38.133
RIGHT.

1397
00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.276
I MEAN. WHAT WAS HE GOING TO
INSIST?

1398
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.667
NO. BITCH.

1399
00:45:42.734 --> 00:45:43.910
THEY'RE GETTING BACK AT THE BACK

1400
00:45:43.934 --> 00:45:45.367
BACK OF THE HEAD KISS.

1401
00:45:45.434 --> 00:45:47.033
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

1402
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.700
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE IT.
TAKE ALL OF IT.

1403
00:45:48.734 --> 00:45:49.400
I KNOW YOU LOVE IT.

1404
00:45:49.467 --> 00:45:51.534
[LAUGHTER]

1405
00:45:51.601 --> 00:45:56.200
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

1406
00:45:56.267 --> 00:45:58.801
AND ALSO THE SALIENT POINT ABOUT

1407
00:45:58.868 --> 00:46:01.567
THIS SCANDAL IS THAT JOE BIDEN

1408
00:46:01.634 --> 00:46:03.267
WAS NOT TRYING TO GET LAID.

1409
00:46:03.334 --> 00:46:05.834
DOING THIS. RIGHT?

1410
00:46:05.901 --> 00:46:08.667
ANDREW CUOMO WAS TRYING TO GET

1411
00:46:08.734 --> 00:46:11.100
LAID. BADLY. BY THE WAY.

1412
00:46:11.167 --> 00:46:14.367
I MEAN. ONE OF HIS BIG PLOYS WAS

1413
00:46:14.434 --> 00:46:15.734
HE WOULD HAVE HIS PRETTY

1414
00:46:15.801 --> 00:46:16.968
ASSISTANTS COME UP TO THE

1415
00:46:17.033 --> 00:46:18.400
GOVERNOR'S MANSION AT NIGHT TO

1416
00:46:18.467 --> 00:46:19.767
SHOW HIM HOW TO DO SOMETHING ON

1417
00:46:19.834 --> 00:46:21.300
HIS PHONE.

1418
00:46:21.367 --> 00:46:22.567
YEAH. YEAH.

1419
00:46:22.634 --> 00:46:23.968
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING HOTTER

1420
00:46:24.033 --> 00:46:25.567
THAN AN OLD GUY WHO CAN'T WORK

1421
00:46:25.634 --> 00:46:26.567
HIS PHONE.

1422
00:46:26.634 --> 00:46:29.467
[LAUGHTER]

1423
00:46:29.534 --> 00:46:30.367
THAT IS KRYPTONITE FOR THE

1424
00:46:30.434 --> 00:46:35.334
PUSSY.

1425
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:35.601
[LAUGHTER]
LET ME TELL YOU. JUST THE

1426
00:46:36.234 --> 00:46:37.844
PANTIES ARE WET BEFORE THEY GET
OUT OF THE CAR JUST THINKING

1427
00:46:37.868 --> 00:46:38.467
ABOUT THAT.

1428
00:46:38.534 --> 00:46:42.434
[LAUGHTER]

1429
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:43.700
MAN. WE HAVE GOT TO TEACH GAME

1430
00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:48.200
IN AMERICA.

1431
00:46:48.267 --> 00:46:48.467
[LAUGHTER]

1432
00:46:48.534 --> 00:46:51.200
I MEAN. SERIOUSLY.

1433
00:46:51.267 --> 00:46:53.801
I MEAN. ASIDE FROM THE HORRORS

1434
00:46:53.868 --> 00:46:55.601
THAT WOMEN ARE PUT THROUGH. I'M

1435
00:46:55.667 --> 00:46:56.601
ALWAYS THINKING. WHAT MAN THINKS

1436
00:46:56.667 --> 00:47:03.767
THIS SHIT IS GOING TO WORK?

1437
00:47:03.834 --> 00:47:05.376
ONE OF THE FIRST #MeToo
CASUALTIES. WELL DESERVED. I

1438
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.033
MIGHT ADD. WAS THIS JOURNALIST.

1439
00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:08.801
MARK HALPERIN. REMEMBER HIM AND

1440
00:47:08.868 --> 00:47:09.988
YOU KNOW HIS M.O. AS ALWAYS.

1441
00:47:10.033 --> 00:47:11.313
WITH THESE CASES. YOU KNOW. LIKE

1442
00:47:11.367 --> 00:47:12.300
MANY WOMEN COME FORWARD. IT'S

1443
00:47:12.367 --> 00:47:13.487
ALWAYS THE SAME STORY IN THE

1444
00:47:13.534 --> 00:47:15.467
SAME THING.

1445
00:47:15.534 --> 00:47:17.567
A GUY HAS A THING. AND HIS WAS

1446
00:47:17.634 --> 00:47:19.767
TO LIKE. AT THE OFFICE. CORNER

1447
00:47:19.834 --> 00:47:20.767
YOU SOMEWHERE AND JUST RUB HIS

1448
00:47:20.834 --> 00:47:25.701
BONER AGAINST YOU.

1449
00:47:25.767 --> 00:47:25.968
[LAUGHTER]
WHEN HAS THIS EVER WORKED IS MY

1450
00:47:26.667 --> 00:47:29.634
QUESTION?

1451
00:47:29.701 --> 00:47:29.901
[LAUGHTER]

1452
00:47:29.968 --> 00:47:31.567
HAS THERE EVER BEEN A WOMAN WHO

1453
00:47:31.634 --> 00:47:33.200
WAS LIKE. YOU KNOW. I WASN'T

1454
00:47:33.267 --> 00:47:35.200
EVER REALLY THAT INTO BOB.

1455
00:47:35.267 --> 00:47:38.000
[LAUGHTER]

1456
00:47:38.067 --> 00:47:40.100
BUT THEN HE DID THAT THING THAT

1457
00:47:40.167 --> 00:47:42.667
DOGS DO TO THROW PILLOWS. AND I

1458
00:47:42.734 --> 00:47:44.167
JUST MELTED.

1459
00:47:44.234 --> 00:47:49.767
[APPLAUSE]

1460
00:47:49.834 --> 00:47:51.901
NO. WE HAVE GOT TO TEACH GAME IN

1461
00:47:51.968 --> 00:47:54.033
THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE ANY TIME...

1462
00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.934
ANY TIME MEN CAN'T GET WOMEN.

1463
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.434
PRIESTS. TALIBAN. INCELS IN THIS

1464
00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.267
COUNTRY. YOU KNOW WHAT INCELS

1465
00:48:02.334 --> 00:48:04.000
ARE?

1466
00:48:04.067 --> 00:48:05.701
YEAH. IT'S A WHOLE MOVEMENT.

1467
00:48:05.767 --> 00:48:06.567
IT STANDS FOR INVOLUNTARILY

1468
00:48:06.634 --> 00:48:10.701
CELIBATE.

1469
00:48:10.767 --> 00:48:12.276
YEAH. I USED TO BE AN INCEL.
WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE A NAME FOR

1470
00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:15.300
IT.

1471
00:48:15.367 --> 00:48:15.567
[LAUGHTER]
I DIDN'T WANT TO FUCKING TALK

1472
00:48:16.234 --> 00:48:16.667
ABOUT IT WITH THAT.

1473
00:48:16.734 --> 00:48:18.009
THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO IS

1474
00:48:18.033 --> 00:48:19.267
JOIN A GROUP OF OTHER FUCKING

1475
00:48:19.334 --> 00:48:22.100
LOSERS WHO COULDN'T GET LAID.

1476
00:48:22.167 --> 00:48:23.601
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE FRIENDS

1477
00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:25.100
WITH GUYS WHO COULD GET LAID.

1478
00:48:25.167 --> 00:48:26.167
MAYBE GET A LEFTOVER OR

1479
00:48:26.234 --> 00:48:26.868
SOMETHING. YOU KNOW?

1480
00:48:26.934 --> 00:48:34.801
[LAUGHTER]

1481
00:48:34.868 --> 00:48:36.210
THAT... THAT WAS NOT MY
STRATEGY WHEN I COULDN'T GET

1482
00:48:36.234 --> 00:48:36.567
LAID.
MY STRATEGY WAS TO MASTURBATE

1483
00:48:37.234 --> 00:48:41.267
AND PLOT.

1484
00:48:41.334 --> 00:48:41.534
[LAUGHTER]
THAT WAS MY STRATEGY.

1485
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.200
MASTURBATING AND PLOTTING.

1486
00:48:43.267 --> 00:48:44.601
AND I CAME UP WITH THIS.

1487
00:48:44.667 --> 00:48:47.801
NO.

1488
00:48:47.868 --> 00:48:49.467
[APPLAUSE]

1489
00:48:49.534 --> 00:48:50.844
NO. NO. NO. NO. I DO THIS FOR
THE LOVE OF COMEDY. LADIES AND

1490
00:48:50.868 --> 00:48:58.467
GENTLEMEN. COMEDY.

1491
00:48:58.534 --> 00:48:59.234
BUT YOU DO REALIZE THAT ALL THE

1492
00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.567
#MeToo STUFF IS WEAPONIZED

1493
00:49:00.634 --> 00:49:02.234
AGAINST ONE SIDE.

1494
00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.033
YOU KNOW. BECAUSE THE

1495
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.868
REPUBLICANS DON'T CARE.

1496
00:49:05.934 --> 00:49:07.214
LOOK AT ALL THE MANY. MANY. MANY

1497
00:49:07.267 --> 00:49:08.100
DOZENS OF WOMEN TRUMP ABUSED.

1498
00:49:08.167 --> 00:49:09.767
THEY NEVER CARED.

1499
00:49:09.834 --> 00:49:10.601
THE HOLLYWOOD ACCESS TAPE.

1500
00:49:10.667 --> 00:49:11.868
THEY DIDN'T CARE.

1501
00:49:11.934 --> 00:49:13.400
THEY RAN A FUCKING CHILD

1502
00:49:13.467 --> 00:49:14.567
MOLESTER IN ALABAMA.

1503
00:49:14.634 --> 00:49:16.300
THEY DON'T CARE.

1504
00:49:16.367 --> 00:49:17.447
DEMOCRATS. WE GOT RID OF AL

1505
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.500
FRANKEN. RIGHT?

1506
00:49:19.567 --> 00:49:20.734
BILL CLINTON. NOT ALLOWED TO

1507
00:49:20.801 --> 00:49:22.834
MAKE A SPEECH ANYMORE.

1508
00:49:22.901 --> 00:49:24.300
ELIOT SPITZER. I THOUGHT. WAS A

1509
00:49:24.367 --> 00:49:25.367
REALLY GOOD PROGRESSIVE

1510
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.701
GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK.

1511
00:49:26.767 --> 00:49:27.500
HE HAD TO GO AWAY BECAUSE HE HAD

1512
00:49:27.567 --> 00:49:29.400
A HOOKER SCANDAL.

1513
00:49:29.467 --> 00:49:30.968
AND. YOU KNOW. WHEN A POLITICIAN

1514
00:49:31.033 --> 00:49:32.834
GETS BLOWN BY A HOOKER. IT TAKES

1515
00:49:32.901 --> 00:49:34.181
A JOB AWAY FROM A LOBBYIST.
SO...

1516
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:40.300
[LAUGHTER]

1517
00:49:40.367 --> 00:49:42.534
THAT CANNOT HAPPEN.

1518
00:49:42.601 --> 00:49:43.968
BUT REALLY. YOU LOOK AT THE

1519
00:49:44.033 --> 00:49:46.167
#MeToo CASES. IT'S ALWAYS A LOT

1520
00:49:46.234 --> 00:49:47.634
OF LEFT STUFF.

1521
00:49:47.701 --> 00:49:51.934

I'M ALWAYS LIKE. REALLY?

1525
00:49:56.934 --> 00:49:58.534

00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:08.701

FRACKING IS FILLED WITH NOTHING

1529
00:50:09.767 --> 00:50:10.334
BUT PERFECT FEMINISTS.

1530
00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.868
I MEAN.

1531
00:50:11.934 --> 00:50:14.868
NPR FIRED EIGHT PEOPLE.

1532
00:50:14.934 --> 00:50:17.167
NPR IS THE SEED OF PREDATION IN

1533
00:50:17.234 --> 00:50:18.443
AMERICA?
ONE OF THEM WAS GARRISON

1534
00:50:18.467 --> 00:50:19.734
KEILLOR.

1535
00:50:19.801 --> 00:50:24.968
YOU KNOW GARRISON KEILLOR.

1536
00:50:25.033 --> 00:50:26.210
NO. I HAVE NO DOG IN THIS
FIGHT.

1537
00:50:26.234 --> 00:50:27.710
HE'D NEVER BEEN ON MY SHOW.
I'VE NEVER HEARD HIS SHOW

1538
00:50:27.734 --> 00:50:28.500
BECAUSE I DON'T OWN A CANDLE

1539
00:50:28.567 --> 00:50:32.868
SHOP IN VERMONT.

1540
00:50:32.934 --> 00:50:34.574

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.567

I'M READING THE STORY. AND IT'S

1550
00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.901
BULLYING AROUND THE OFFICE.

1551
00:50:52.968 --> 00:50:54.534
WELL. THAT'S VAGUE. YOU KNOW.

1552
00:50:54.601 --> 00:50:55.767

00:50:55.834 --> 00:50:56.910
OCCASION. I THOUGHT. OKAY. HERE

IT IS.

1555
00:50:59.767 --> 00:51:01.467
AND ON ONE OCCASION THAT THE

00:51:01.534 --> 00:51:02.734
DICK CAME OUT AT THE CHRISTMAS

1557
00:51:02.801 --> 00:51:03.667

[LAUGHTER]

1559
00:51:05.834 --> 00:51:07.300
NO.

1560
00:51:07.367 --> 00:51:09.367
AND ON ONE OCCASION. HE POSTED

1561
00:51:09.434 --> 00:51:11.300
AN OFF COLOR LIMERICK ON THE

1562
00:51:11.367 --> 00:51:13.901
DOORWAY OF HIS BOOKSHOP.

1563
00:51:13.968 --> 00:51:14.901
REALLY?

1564
00:51:14.968 --> 00:51:18.234
WE'RE GETTING PEOPLE FOR

1565
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:19.300
LIMERICKS NOW?
[LAUGHTER]

1566
00:51:19.367 --> 00:51:21.067
SEE. THIS IS THE PROBLEM WHEN

00:51:21.133 --> 00:51:22.601
YOU START LUMPING... NO LUMPING

1568
00:51:22.667 --> 00:51:24.400
THE REALLY BAD PEOPLE WITH LIKE

1569
00:51:24.467 --> 00:51:26.567
SOME PEOPLE JUST HAD A BAD DATE.

1570
00:51:26.634 --> 00:51:32.801
AZIZ ANSARI HAD TO GO TO JAIL

1571
00:51:32.868 --> 00:51:34.577
WOKE JAIL FOR TWO YEARS.
HE JUST HAD A BAD DATE.

1572
00:51:34.601 --> 00:51:35.133
IT'S A ONE SIDED STORY.

1573
00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:39.100
WE ONLY EVER HEARD HER SIDE.

1574
00:51:39.167 --> 00:51:40.210
EVEN BY HER SIDE. NOTHING
HAPPENED.

1575
00:51:40.234 --> 00:51:41.133
NOTHING BAD HAPPENED.

1576
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.500
I'M SORRY.

1577
00:51:42.567 --> 00:51:45.000
[APPLAUSE]

1578
00:51:45.067 --> 00:51:46.968
I'M SORRY YOU HAD A BAD TIME ON

1579
00:51:47.033 --> 00:51:48.243
A DATE WITH A GUY WHO WAS TRYING

1580
00:51:48.267 --> 00:51:49.567
TO GET INTO YOUR PANTS.

1581
00:51:49.634 --> 00:51:51.400
THAT'S LIFE.

1582
00:51:51.467 --> 00:51:52.476
YOU EVER HEAR THE PHRASE YOU

1583
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.634
HAVE TO KISS A LOT OF FROGS?

1584
00:51:53.701 --> 00:51:54.710
WELL. YOU CHOSE TO KISS THIS

1585
00:51:54.734 --> 00:51:55.901
ONE.

1586
00:51:55.968 --> 00:51:57.334
AND BY THE WAY. YOU CHOSE TO LET

1587
00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.440
HIM EAT YOUR PUSSY BY YOUR

1588
00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.500
ACCOUNT.

1589
00:51:59.567 --> 00:52:00.334
IT'S TRUE.

1590
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.601
IT'S IN THE ACCOUNT.

1591
00:52:01.667 --> 00:52:02.844
I MEAN. YOU DON'T LIKE A DATE.

1592
00:52:02.868 --> 00:52:04.400
LEAVE.

1593
00:52:04.467 --> 00:52:05.634
THAT'S WHY RESTAURANTS HAVE

1594
00:52:05.701 --> 00:52:07.300
BATHROOMS WITH WINDOWS.

1595
00:52:07.367 --> 00:52:13.601
[LAUGHTER]

1596
00:52:13.667 --> 00:52:15.000

00:52:15.067 --> 00:52:16.500
THE RESTAURANT. GOES BACK TO HIS

1598
00:52:16.567 --> 00:52:18.701
APARTMENT. I ASSUME VOLUNTARILY.

1599
00:52:18.767 --> 00:52:20.327
HE'S 5'4".
I DON'T THINK HE DRAGGED HER.

1600
00:52:20.601 --> 00:52:26.901
[LAUGHTER]

1601
00:52:26.968 --> 00:52:28.467
HAS HIM EAT HER PUSSY AND THEN

1602
00:52:28.534 --> 00:52:30.968
IS MIFFED BECAUSE HE EXPECTED

1603
00:52:31.033 --> 00:52:34.133
INTERCOURSE. WHICH I DON'T THINK

1604
00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.834
IS AN UNREASONABLE EXPECTATION.

1605
00:52:35.901 --> 00:52:37.467
[LAUGHTER]

1606
00:52:37.534 --> 00:52:38.133
I DON'T.

1607
00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.701
I DON'T.

1608
00:52:41.767 --> 00:52:42.901
IT'S LIKE IF YOU WERE AT A

1609
00:52:42.968 --> 00:52:44.167
DINNER PARTY AND THEY SERVE A

1610
00:52:44.234 --> 00:52:46.133
SALAD COURSE.

1611
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:50.434
[LAUGHTER]

1612
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.000
AM I CRAZY TO THINK SOME CHICKEN

00:52:53.067 --> 00:52:54.307
OR FISH IS GOING TO COME OUT OF

1614
00:52:54.367 --> 00:52:55.200
THAT KITCHEN AT SOME POINT?

1615
00:52:55.267 --> 00:52:56.868
I DON'T THINK SO.

1616
00:52:56.934 --> 00:53:03.200

YEAH.

1619
00:53:05.934 --> 00:53:07.634
SHE WAS PISSED OFF BECAUSE SHE

1620
00:53:07.701 --> 00:53:10.367
SAID HE MISSED THE SIGNALS.

1621
00:53:10.434 --> 00:53:11.968
OH. YES. HONEY. IT'S SO HARD TO

1622
00:53:12.033 --> 00:53:13.434

1623

I DON'T EVEN THINK THERE SHOULD

1629
00:53:28.934 --> 00:53:30.543
BE SUCH A WORD AS SLUT AT ALL.
THANK YOU. SLUT.

1630

[LAUGHTER]

1631
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.934
NICE TO SEE THAT.

1632
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:36.934
SLUTS ARE ALWAYS IN THE BACK AT

1633
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.801
COMEDY SHOWS.

1634
00:53:38.868 --> 00:53:40.068
MUSIC. THEY'RE RIGHT UP FRONT.

1635
00:53:40.133 --> 00:53:43.167
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

1636
00:53:43.234 --> 00:53:44.274
THAT. BUT... NO. A SLUT IS

1637
00:53:44.334 --> 00:53:44.868
SOMEONE WHO'S HAVING MORE SEX

1638
00:53:44.934 --> 00:53:46.234
THAN YOU ARE.

1639
00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.443
THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF A SLUT.

1640

BUT COME ON. HONEY.

1644
00:53:53.534 --> 00:53:54.934

THREE HOURS PUT HIS TONGUE IN

1646
00:53:55.767 --> 00:53:58.200

1647
00:53:58.267 --> 00:53:59.534
SO MAYBE STICKLER FOR THE RULES

1648
00:53:59.601 --> 00:54:01.467

I MEAN. I JUST WONDER WHO ARE

1651
00:54:07.834 --> 00:54:09.834
THESE THESE PERFECT PEOPLE THAT

1652
00:54:09.901 --> 00:54:10.976
WE HAVE IN AMERICA NOW. SO MANY

1653
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.500
PERFECT PEOPLE WHO NEVER MAKE A

1654
00:54:12.567 --> 00:54:13.968
MISTAKE. NEVER DO ANYTHING

1655
00:54:14.033 --> 00:54:15.968
WRONG. GET TO JUDGE YOUR DATE.

1656
00:54:16.033 --> 00:54:17.353
I DON'T LIKE THE DATE YOU WERE
ON.

1657
00:54:17.601 --> 00:54:20.234
WHO GIVES A SHIT WHAT YOU LIKE?

1658
00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.820
YOU KNOW. I MEAN. HE DID NOTHING
WRONG.

1659
00:54:22.167 --> 00:54:23.167
NOTHING COERCIVE. NOTHING

1660
00:54:23.234 --> 00:54:25.367
IMMORAL. NOTHING DIFFERENT THAN

1661
00:54:25.434 --> 00:54:27.567
THE WAY PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS

1662
00:54:27.634 --> 00:54:29.434
FUMBLED TOWARD GETTING LAID.

1663
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.300
IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE.

1664
00:54:32.367 --> 00:54:34.000
I AM ALWAYS JEALOUS OF GAY MEN.

1665
00:54:34.067 --> 00:54:37.000
YOU KNOW.

1666
00:54:37.067 --> 00:54:38.143
THEY DON'T HAVE TO TALK ANYBODY

1667
00:54:38.167 --> 00:54:39.367
INTO IT. YOU KNOW?
THEY JUST...

1668
00:54:39.467 --> 00:54:43.334
[LAUGHTER]

1669
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:43.834
I LIKE IT.

1670
00:54:43.901 --> 00:54:44.901
YOU LIKE IT?

1671
00:54:44.934 --> 00:54:49.601
LET'S DO IT.

1672
00:54:49.667 --> 00:54:49.868
[LAUGHTER]
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LEAVE THE

1673
00:54:50.567 --> 00:54:51.467
BAR.

1674
00:54:51.534 --> 00:54:58.200
[LAUGHTER]

1675
00:54:58.267 --> 00:54:59.400
NOW. ALL MY LIFE. I'VE HEARD

1676
00:54:59.467 --> 00:55:01.067
THIS TERM "A SURE THING."

1677
00:55:01.133 --> 00:55:02.634
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU. FOLKS.

1678
00:55:02.701 --> 00:55:04.334
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A

1679
00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.267
SURE THING. AND I CAN PROVE IT.

1680
00:55:07.334 --> 00:55:10.367
I WAS ONCE WITH A WOMAN SOME

1681
00:55:10.434 --> 00:55:11.968
YEARS AGO. AND I WAS FULLY

1682
00:55:12.033 --> 00:55:15.000
NAKED AND FULLY ERECT.

1683
00:55:15.067 --> 00:55:16.300
GOODNIGHT. LADIES.

1684
00:55:16.367 --> 00:55:18.667
[LAUGHTER]

1685
00:55:18.734 --> 00:55:21.067
I THOUGHT I'D LEAVE ON A HIGH

1686
00:55:21.133 --> 00:55:22.000
NOTE. BUT NO. I WAS FULLY NAKED.

1687
00:55:22.067 --> 00:55:23.901
FULLY ERECT.

1688
00:55:23.968 --> 00:55:24.500
SHE WAS FULLY NAKED AND FULLY

1689
00:55:24.567 --> 00:55:29.901
ERECT.

1690
00:55:29.968 --> 00:55:31.076
[LAUGHTER]
I'M TELLING YOU THIS.

1691
00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:32.610
THIS SHIT WAS HOT.

00:55:32.634 --> 00:55:33.534

1693
00:55:33.601 --> 00:55:35.634
[LAUGHTER]

1694
00:55:35.701 --> 00:55:37.100
IT WAS LIKE ONE OF THOSE SPACE

1695
00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:38.367
MOVIES. YOU KNOW. WHERE YOU...

1696
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.534
[LAUGHTER]

1697
00:55:41.601 --> 00:55:43.067
YOU KNOW. THEY'RE PLAYING THE

1698
00:55:43.133 --> 00:55:43.901
CLASSICAL MUSIC AND IT'S ABOUT

1699
00:55:43.968 --> 00:55:45.200
TO DOCK.

1700
00:55:45.267 --> 00:55:46.901
AND THEN AT THE LAST SECOND. SHE

1701
00:55:46.968 --> 00:55:47.767
CHANGED HER MIND. AND I HAD TO

1702
00:55:47.834 --> 00:55:50.734
TAKE MY BALLS AND GO HOME.

1703
00:55:50.801 --> 00:55:51.844
AND THAT'S WHEN I LEARNED DATING

1704
00:55:51.868 --> 00:55:53.701
IS LIKE THE MOVIE INDUSTRY.

1705
00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:54.334
I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN IT'S IN THE

1706
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:59.100
CAN.

1707
00:55:59.167 --> 00:55:59.367
[LAUGHTER]

1708
00:55:59.434 --> 00:56:02.868
BUT...

1709
00:56:02.934 --> 00:56:03.976
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT YOU KNOW. THAT'S... THAT'S

1710
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:04.801
LIFE.

1711
00:56:04.868 --> 00:56:06.043
YOU KNOW THAT PROBABLY THE MOST

1712
00:56:06.067 --> 00:56:07.834
AWKWARD. DIFFICULT TRANSITION

1713
00:56:07.901 --> 00:56:10.434
ANY TWO HUMANS CAN EVER MAKE IS.

1714
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.100
I LIKE YOU.

1715
00:56:11.167 --> 00:56:13.567
YOU LIKE ME.

1716
00:56:13.634 --> 00:56:14.643
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN ACTUALLY

1717
00:56:14.667 --> 00:56:16.701
INSIDE YOU.

1718
00:56:16.767 --> 00:56:17.777
I'M... I'M ASKING NOW IF I COULD

1719
00:56:17.801 --> 00:56:23.968
BE INSIDE YOU.

1720
00:56:24.033 --> 00:56:24.234
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU COME TO

1721
00:56:24.868 --> 00:56:25.367
SOMEBODY'S DOOR AND THEY'RE

1722
00:56:25.434 --> 00:56:26.934
LIKE. CAN I COME IN?

1723
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:27.834
AND THEY'RE LIKE. LET'S JUST

1724
00:56:27.901 --> 00:56:29.267
TALK RIGHT HERE.

1725
00:56:29.334 --> 00:56:31.167
[LAUGHTER]

1726
00:56:31.234 --> 00:56:32.310
IN FACT. I'M GOING TO COME OUT

1727
00:56:32.334 --> 00:56:33.234
ON THE PORCH. IF YOU DON'T MIND.

1728
00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:36.467
YOU KNOW.

1729
00:56:36.534 --> 00:56:38.467
I MEAN. IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'S

1730
00:56:38.534 --> 00:56:39.234
HARD TO CROSS AT LEAST THE

1731
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.500
HETEROSEXUAL DIVIDE.

1732
00:56:41.567 --> 00:56:42.400
LET ME TELL YOU THIS. I'VE

1733
00:56:42.467 --> 00:56:44.467
NEVER. NEVER MET A WOMAN WHO

1734
00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:46.200
I'VE KNOWN FOR ANY AMOUNT OF

1735
00:56:46.267 --> 00:56:50.067
TIME WHO DIDN'T HAVE SOME

1736
00:56:50.133 --> 00:56:51.567
VERSION OF A STORY WHERE THEY

1737
00:56:51.634 --> 00:56:54.200
WERE INTRODUCED TO A GUY. MET

1738
00:56:54.267 --> 00:56:54.868
THEM ONLINE. ACROSS THE ROOM. AT

1739
00:56:54.934 --> 00:56:56.300
A BAR. WHATEVER.

1740
00:56:56.367 --> 00:56:57.667
AND THEY WERE LIKE. OH. HE SHE'S

1741
00:56:57.734 --> 00:56:58.868
CUTE.

1742
00:56:58.934 --> 00:57:00.367
HE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A PSYCHO.

1743
00:57:00.434 --> 00:57:02.267
THEY THOUGHT SOMETHING GOOD

1744
00:57:02.334 --> 00:57:04.567
MIGHT HAPPEN AND THEN THEY ALL

1745
00:57:04.634 --> 00:57:07.767
HAVE SOME VERSION OF. AND THEN

1746
00:57:07.834 --> 00:57:08.400
HE OPENED HIS MOUTH. AND I LOST

1747
00:57:08.467 --> 00:57:09.901
INTEREST.

1748
00:57:09.968 --> 00:57:12.934
EVERY WOMAN HAS THAT STORY...

1749
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.834
[APPLAUSE]

1750
00:57:14.901 --> 00:57:16.133
AND NO MEN.

1751

[LAUGHTER]

1752
00:57:18.934 --> 00:57:21.534
NO MEN.

1753
00:57:21.601 --> 00:57:24.934
MEN DO NOT HAVE THAT STORY.

1754
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.040
I WAS THE WORST WHEN I WAS

1755
00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:27.834
YOUNGER.

1756
00:57:27.901 --> 00:57:29.567
A WOMAN COULD SAY ANYTHING.

1757
00:57:29.634 --> 00:57:30.901
SHE COULD SAY. "I'M A NAZI."

1758
00:57:30.968 --> 00:57:33.667
[LAUGHTER]

1759
00:57:33.734 --> 00:57:35.033
AND I'D BE LIKE. SO WERE YOU

1760
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:37.400
ALWAYS INTERESTED IN GERMANY. OR

1761
00:57:37.467 --> 00:57:40.434
WAS IT MORE OF A POLITICAL...

1762
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:43.067
[LAUGHTER]

1763
00:57:43.133 --> 00:57:45.400
SO. LOOK. WE'VE COME A LONG WAY.

1764
00:57:45.467 --> 00:57:49.167
NOT SO MUCH MEN. BUT. YOU KNOW.

1765
00:57:49.234 --> 00:57:51.467
WE'RE TRYING. YOU KNOW. I MEAN.

1766
00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:53.334
100 YEARS AGO. MEN DIDN'T EVEN

1767
00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:56.033
THINK WOMEN HAD SEXUAL FEELINGS.

1768
00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:56.634
NOW WE KNOW THEY ACTUALLY HAVE

1769
00:57:56.701 --> 00:57:58.434
BETTER ONES.

1770
00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.234
THE CLITORIS HAS OVER 8.000

1771
00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.267
NERVE ENDINGS.

1772
00:58:01.334 --> 00:58:01.834
IT'S ALMOST AS SENSITIVE AS

1773
00:58:01.901 --> 00:58:02.934
MILLENNIALS.

1774
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.701
[LAUGHTER]

1775
00:58:05.767 --> 00:58:06.801
I LOVE MINE.

1776
00:58:06.868 --> 00:58:07.934
WHERE ARE MY MILLENNIALS?

1777
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.334
I LOVE MY MILLENNIALS.

1778
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.767
THEY GOT ME THROUGH THE

1779
00:58:11.834 --> 00:58:12.901
PANDEMIC. AND THE KIDS MY

1780
00:58:12.968 --> 00:58:15.434
AGE WOULDN'T GO OUT TO PLAY.

1781
00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:16.734
I DIDN'T KNOW WHY BOOMERS AND

1782
00:58:16.801 --> 00:58:18.276
MILLENNIALS. WHY ARE WE ALWAYS
FEUDING?

1783
00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:19.443
THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE. YOU RUINED
THE WORLD.

1784
00:58:19.467 --> 00:58:20.867
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

1785
00:58:20.968 --> 00:58:22.067
RUINED THE WORLD.

1786
00:58:22.133 --> 00:58:24.868
TAKE IT.

1787
00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:26.300
YOU'RE OVER 40 NOW.

1788
00:58:26.367 --> 00:58:27.701
THE OLDEST OF YOU.

1789
00:58:27.767 --> 00:58:29.207
YOU'VE HAD FIVE ELECTIONS TO
VOTE IN.

1790
00:58:29.567 --> 00:58:30.667
TAKE THE WORLD.

1791
00:58:30.734 --> 00:58:31.910
NO ONE IS JUST GOING TO GIVE IT
TO YOU.

1792
00:58:31.934 --> 00:58:32.868
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

1793
00:58:32.934 --> 00:58:34.009
YOU GREW UP STEALING MUSIC AND

1794
00:58:34.033 --> 00:58:34.634
NOW YOU THINK EVERYTHING SHOULD

1795
00:58:34.701 --> 00:58:35.767
BE FREE.

1796
00:58:35.834 --> 00:58:37.000
[LAUGHTER]

1797
00:58:37.067 --> 00:58:42.033
TAKE IT.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

1799
00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.400
AND GEN Z ARE EVEN WORSE.

1800
00:58:45.467 --> 00:58:46.710
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SAY
ANYTHING.

1801
00:58:46.734 --> 00:58:47.934
I MAY NEED THEIR BLOOD.

1803
00:58:53.868 --> 00:58:54.868
NO.

BUT. YOU KNOW. THEY JUST... THEY

1806
00:58:59.767 --> 00:59:01.801
JUST SEEM TO BE LOCKED INTO

1807
00:59:01.868 --> 00:59:03.534
CHILDHOOD AS A WAY OF LIFE.

1808
00:59:03.601 --> 00:59:05.334
YOU KNOW. THEY EVEN HAVE A WORD

1809
00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.968
FOR WHEN THEY DO SOMETHING THAT

1810
00:59:07.033 --> 00:59:14.033
ISN'T CHILDISH. ADULTING.

1811
00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.610
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS. #Adulting.
I SCRAMBLED AN EGG TODAY.

1812
00:59:15.634 --> 00:59:21.734
ADULTING.

#Adulting.
[LAUGHTER]

1814
00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.680
I MADE A DENTAL APPOINTMENT.
ADULTING.

1815

I WIPE MY OWN ASS.
I GUESS I'M TURNING INTO MY DAD.

FRAGILITY NOW IN THIS FRAGILITY.

1819
00:59:34.868 --> 00:59:36.801
IT'S WITH THE YOUNG.

1820
00:59:36.868 --> 00:59:39.868
LAST TIME I WENT TO USE UBER.

1821
00:59:39.934 --> 00:59:41.667
THE SCREEN CAME UP AND SAID.

1822
00:59:41.734 --> 00:59:42.334
WOULD YOU LIKE CONVERSATION WITH

1823
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.868
THE DRIVER?

1824
00:59:45.934 --> 00:59:46.133

REALLY. WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR

1830
00:59:53.968 --> 00:59:56.200
THAT?

1831
00:59:56.267 --> 00:59:58.067
AND I HAVE TO BE RATED. I DON'T

1832
00:59:58.133 --> 01:00:00.400
WANT TO BE RATED BY A FUCKING

1833
01:00:00.467 --> 01:00:01.834
CAB DRIVER. AND I DON'T WANT TO

1834
01:00:01.901 --> 01:00:03.434
WASTE A NANOSECOND RATING HIM.

1835
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.467
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER

1836
01:00:05.534 --> 01:00:06.643
I GET OUT OF YOUR CAR. YOU CAN

1837
01:00:06.667 --> 01:00:08.801
KILL THE NEXT PASSENGER.

1838
01:00:08.868 --> 01:00:10.601
THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

1839
01:00:10.667 --> 01:00:12.300
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

1840
01:00:12.367 --> 01:00:17.601
[LAUGHTER]

1841
01:00:17.667 --> 01:00:19.634
BUT YOU KNOW. I MAY NEED UBER.

1842
01:00:19.701 --> 01:00:21.901
SO I DON'T WANT A BAD RATING.

1843
01:00:21.968 --> 01:00:23.367
SO I WIND UP TALKING TO THE GUY

1844
01:00:23.434 --> 01:00:24.367
AND HE DOESN'T WANT A BAD

1845
01:00:24.434 --> 01:00:25.567
RATING.

1846
01:00:25.634 --> 01:00:26.901
SO HE TALKS TO ME. PROBABLY

1847
01:00:26.968 --> 01:00:28.434
DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME EITHER.

1848
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.400
SO WE'RE BOTH PUTTING ON THIS

1849
01:00:29.467 --> 01:00:32.934
KABUKI DANCE FOR EACH OTHER.

1850
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:33.200
[LAUGHTER]
AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS SUCH AN

1851
01:00:33.901 --> 01:00:35.200
EPITOME OF WHAT MODERN LIFE IS.

1852
01:00:35.267 --> 01:00:39.868
PEOPLE FAKING THEIR LIFE. FAKING

1853
01:00:39.934 --> 01:00:41.009
WHAT IS INSTAGRAM. BUT FAKING

1854
01:00:41.033 --> 01:00:41.267
YOUR LIFE.

1855
01:00:41.334 --> 01:00:42.343
EVERYONE'S ALWAYS GETTING BLOWN

1856
01:00:42.367 --> 01:00:43.601
UNDER A PALM TREE OR DRINKING

1857
01:00:43.667 --> 01:00:46.667
MAI TAIS AT SUNSET.

1858
01:00:46.734 --> 01:00:48.701
NO ONE'S EVER DUCT TAPING THEIR

1859
01:00:48.767 --> 01:00:52.234
SIDE VIEW MIRROR BACK ONTO THEIR

1860
01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.267
'88 TERCEL. YOU KNOW. IT IS

1861
01:00:54.334 --> 01:00:55.601
YOLO.

1862

[LAUGHTER]

1863
01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:05.000
VIRTUAL IS WORSE.

1864
01:01:05.067 --> 01:01:06.100
OKAY.

1865
01:01:06.167 --> 01:01:09.033
CAN WE JUST PUT IT OUT THERE?

1866
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:09.801
VIRTUAL. WORSE THAN REAL.

1867
01:01:09.868 --> 01:01:12.667
REAL AND ACTUAL IS BETTER THAN

1868
01:01:12.734 --> 01:01:13.944
VIRTUAL AND FACE.
THAT'S WHY YOU KIDS HAVE SO MUCH

1869
01:01:13.968 --> 01:01:16.500
ANXIETY.

1870
01:01:16.567 --> 01:01:18.087
YOU KNOW. JESUS CHRIST. JUST LET
IT GO.

1871
01:01:18.367 --> 01:01:19.367
LIVE YOUR LIFE.
ENJOY IT.

1872
01:01:19.567 --> 01:01:21.234
IT GOES FAST.

01:01:31.133 --> 01:01:33.267
I'M FUCKING KIDDING WITH YOU.

01:01:40.434 --> 01:01:41.476
UNSPOKEN PART IS ALWAYS FOR YOUR

[LAUGHTER]

1888
01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.033
YOU LOOK GREAT FOR YOUR AGE.

1889
01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.143
BECAUSE REALLY. IF I WAS 30 AND

1890
01:01:48.167 --> 01:01:49.434

YOU'D BE LIKE. OH MY GOD. WERE
YOU IN A FIRE?

1892
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:59.000
[LAUGHTER]

1893
01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.200
REALLY?

1894
01:02:00.267 --> 01:02:01.507
WHEN YOU'RE 66. YOU'RE DYING IN

1895
01:02:01.567 --> 01:02:03.534
THE MIRROR EVERY DAY.

1896
01:02:03.601 --> 01:02:05.434
EVERY DAY.

1897
01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.367
I'M LIKE. FUCK CORONA. DO

1898
01:02:06.434 --> 01:02:11.067
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

1899
01:02:11.133 --> 01:02:14.834
BUT. YOU KNOW. I MEAN. I THINK

1900
01:02:14.901 --> 01:02:17.868
THE SECRET TO AGING. I HOPE. IS

1901
01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.467
YOU HAVE TO THROTTLE BACK ON

1902
01:02:19.534 --> 01:02:21.067
WHAT YOU USED TO BE ABLE

1903
01:02:21.133 --> 01:02:22.243
TO DO AND HOW MUCH YOU COULD

1904
01:02:22.267 --> 01:02:23.267
PUNISH YOUR BODY.

1905
01:02:23.334 --> 01:02:24.543
YOU JUST CAN'T KEEP DOING IT AT

1906
01:02:24.567 --> 01:02:26.767
THE RATE YOU USED TO DO IT.

1907
01:02:26.834 --> 01:02:28.200
I THINK I'VE DONE THAT PRETTY

1908
01:02:28.267 --> 01:02:29.200
WELL PLEASE. JESUS.

1909
01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:33.701

1910
01:02:33.767 --> 01:02:39.834

1911
01:02:39.901 --> 01:02:40.100
[LAUGHTER]
BUT... BUT I THINK I HAVE YOU

1912
01:02:40.767 --> 01:02:41.200

01:02:41.267 --> 01:02:42.267
CIGARETTES.

1914
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:45.000
THAT WAS STUPID. BUT I STOPPED.

1915
01:02:45.067 --> 01:02:46.267

[LAUGHTER]

1919
01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.467
SOMETHING. YOU KNOW. I MEAN.

1920
01:02:55.534 --> 01:02:56.968
BECAUSE I HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE.

1921
01:02:57.033 --> 01:02:59.000
I'VE ACTUALLY HAD... I HAD TWO

1922
01:02:59.067 --> 01:03:00.367
BAD. BAD EXPERIENCES.

1923
01:03:00.434 --> 01:03:00.968
AND LOOK. YOU KNOW ME.

1924
01:03:01.033 --> 01:03:02.534
I LOVE POT.

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:07.567
[LAUGHTER]
BUT I HAVE HAD TWO BAD

1927
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.534
EXPERIENCES.

01:03:09.601 --> 01:03:10.743
ONE. OH. THIS WAS ABOUT. I DON'T

1929
01:03:10.767 --> 01:03:11.334
KNOW. 12 YEARS AGO. SOMETHING

1930
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.767
LIKE THAT.

1931
01:03:13.834 --> 01:03:15.033
I WAS HERE. WELL. NOT EXACTLY

1932
01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.000
HERE. BUT ON STAGE DOING THIS.

1933
01:03:17.067 --> 01:03:18.467
AND I WAS TOO HIGH.

1934
01:03:18.534 --> 01:03:22.801
I MEAN. I SAVED MY HIGH FOR YOU.

1935
01:03:22.868 --> 01:03:23.067
[LAUGHTER]

1936
01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:27.300
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

1937
01:03:27.367 --> 01:03:28.643
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT I DO... BUT I DON'T KNOW.

1938
01:03:28.667 --> 01:03:29.910
SOMEONE SPIKED MY DOPE THAT
NIGHT.

1939
01:03:29.934 --> 01:03:31.067
SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW.

1940
01:03:31.133 --> 01:03:32.267
BUT I WAS TOO HIGH ON STAGE.

1941
01:03:32.334 --> 01:03:33.334
IT WAS A NIGHTMARE.

1942
01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.801
THAT FIRST HALF HOUR OF THAT

1943
01:03:34.868 --> 01:03:36.100
SHOW. I GOT THROUGH IT. BUT I

1944
01:03:36.167 --> 01:03:37.701
WAS JUST HANGING ON BY A THREAD.

1945
01:03:37.767 --> 01:03:40.100
I KNEW I WAS IN TROUBLE AT ONE

1946
01:03:40.167 --> 01:03:43.000
POINT WHEN I SAID OBAMA AND THEN

1947
01:03:43.067 --> 01:03:44.367
THOUGHT. IS THAT HIS NAME?

1948
01:03:44.434 --> 01:03:46.868
[LAUGHTER]

1949
01:03:46.934 --> 01:03:48.067
OBAMA.

1950
01:03:48.133 --> 01:03:50.133
OBAMA.

1951
01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.767
OBAMA.

1952
01:03:51.834 --> 01:03:57.467
DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT.

1953
01:03:57.534 --> 01:03:59.934
[LAUGHTER]

1954
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.334
THE OTHER TIME WAS EVEN WORSE

1955
01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.801
WAS ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO.

1956
01:04:03.868 --> 01:04:05.577
AND OH. MY GOD. THIS IS BEFORE
DISPENSARIES. YOU KNOW.

1957
01:04:05.601 --> 01:04:06.777
SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH POT

1958
01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:08.000
IF YOU WERE EATING IT BECAUSE

1959
01:04:08.067 --> 01:04:09.334
YOU ATE IT IN A BROWNIE OR A

1960
01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.844
COOKIE. YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
THEY PUT INTO IT.

1961
01:04:10.868 --> 01:04:12.200
HOW MUCH OF IT?

1962
01:04:12.267 --> 01:04:12.667
OH. MY GOD.
I WAS HOME.

1963
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.067
IT WAS A SATURDAY.

1964
01:04:14.133 --> 01:04:15.200
I HAD A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

1965
01:04:15.267 --> 01:04:17.234
I THOUGHT. OKAY. I'M GOING TO

1966
01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:18.033
GET A LOT OF WORK DONE TODAY.

1967
01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.634
I HAD THIS SHIT CALLED EPHEDRA.

1968
01:04:19.701 --> 01:04:21.101
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?
IT WAS LEGAL.

1969
01:04:21.467 --> 01:04:22.577
THEY SOLD IT IN THE HEALTH FOOD
STORE.

1970
01:04:22.601 --> 01:04:24.067
IT WAS SPEED.

1971
01:04:24.133 --> 01:04:27.000
IT WAS SOME NUT FROM BRAZIL. AND

1972
01:04:27.067 --> 01:04:28.210
THIS NUT FROM NEW JERSEY TOOK
IT.

1973
01:04:28.234 --> 01:04:30.500
[LAUGHTER]

1974
01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:32.267
AND I THOUGHT. OKAY. I'LL TAKE

1975
01:04:32.334 --> 01:04:33.968
THE EPHEDRA FOR ENERGY.

1976
01:04:34.033 --> 01:04:35.300
I'LL TAKE THE BROWNIE FOR

1977
01:04:35.367 --> 01:04:37.300
CREATIVITY.

1978
01:04:37.367 --> 01:04:39.000
OH. FUCK.

1979
01:04:39.067 --> 01:04:41.400
ABOUT A HALF HOUR INTO THIS. I

1980
01:04:41.467 --> 01:04:42.200
WAS LIKE. OH. MY GOD. THIS IS

1981
01:04:42.267 --> 01:04:43.334
GOING TO BE THE WORST.

1982
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.100
AND IT WAS THE WORST NIGHT OF MY

1983
01:04:44.167 --> 01:04:45.267
LIFE.

1984
01:04:45.334 --> 01:04:46.634
I MEAN. I WAS FROZEN SITTING AT

1985
01:04:46.701 --> 01:04:49.167
MY DESK.

1986
01:04:49.234 --> 01:04:50.167
MY HEART WAS BEATING A TRILLION

1987
01:04:50.234 --> 01:04:51.901
TIMES A MINUTE.

1988
01:04:51.968 --> 01:04:53.009
I THOUGHT IF I MOVED. I WOULD

1989
01:04:53.033 --> 01:04:53.667
DIE.

1990
01:04:53.734 --> 01:04:55.133
[LAUGHTER]

1991
01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.901
AT ONE POINT. I THOUGHT MAYBE I

1992
01:04:56.968 --> 01:04:57.567
DID DIE AND THIS IS WHAT HELL

1993
01:04:57.634 --> 01:05:01.033
WAS LIKE.

1994
01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:01.300
[LAUGHTER]

1995
01:05:01.367 --> 01:05:06.801
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT REALITY WAS.

1996
01:05:06.868 --> 01:05:07.801
SO FINALLY. OR AFTER TEN SECONDS

1997
01:05:07.868 --> 01:05:09.701
IT COULD HAVE BEEN TEN

1998
01:05:09.767 --> 01:05:12.868
SECONDS. HONESTLY.

1999
01:05:12.934 --> 01:05:13.667
BUT I FINALLY... THE PHONE WAS

2000
01:05:13.734 --> 01:05:15.000
RIGHT THERE.

2001
01:05:15.067 --> 01:05:17.100
I COULDN'T MOVE TO GET TO IT.

2002
01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:18.367
I FINALLY PICKED UP THE PHONE

2003
01:05:18.434 --> 01:05:19.901
AND CALLED SOMEONE TO HELP ME.

2004
01:05:19.968 --> 01:05:22.033
THE SECOND I PUT THE PHONE DOWN.

2005
01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.200
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I HAD

2006
01:05:23.267 --> 01:05:25.300
ACTUALLY DONE THAT OR JUST

2007
01:05:25.367 --> 01:05:27.734
THOUGHT I HAD DONE THAT.

2008
01:05:27.801 --> 01:05:29.367
SO I CALLED SOMEBODY ELSE.

2009
01:05:29.434 --> 01:05:34.133
