00:43:57.018 --> 00:43:58.476
I don't believe we've had
a proper introduction.

742
00:43:58.559 --> 00:44:00.101
I am Lord Rushworth.

743
00:44:00.184 --> 00:44:01.101
Pleasure.

744
00:44:02.601 --> 00:44:03.851
Please.

745
00:44:06.601 --> 00:44:08.768
[woman laughing in distance]

746
00:44:08.851 --> 00:44:10.184
We'll be as drunk as emperors

747
00:44:10.268 --> 00:44:12.184
after indulging in a few
of these little darlings.

748
00:44:12.268 --> 00:44:14.143
-A mere aspiration...
-Here.

749
00:44:14.226 --> 00:44:16.434
...for the more
imaginative peasant.

750
00:44:16.518 --> 00:44:20.143
No death sentence
more certain than poverty.

751
00:44:20.226 --> 00:44:23.393
I must say. your display today
was dazzling.

752
00:44:23.476 --> 00:44:25.684
And it cost me a pretty penny.

753
00:44:25.768 --> 00:44:28.476
You showed a novel precision
of the wrist and shoulder.

754
00:44:28.559 --> 00:44:31.101
How on earth did you manage
such a feat?

755
00:44:31.184 --> 00:44:33.309
Floating round
with the champion. Rushworth.

756
00:44:33.393 --> 00:44:34.934
Didn't take you long. did it?

757
00:44:35.018 --> 00:44:37.268
As you know. I have
a predilection for winners.

758
00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:39.184
Especially. when they appear
from nowhere.

759
00:44:39.268 --> 00:44:40.643
Bristol ain't nowhere.

760
00:44:40.726 --> 00:44:42.768
4.045 nautical miles

761
00:44:42.851 --> 00:44:44.893
from the sugarcanes
of Jamaica in fact.

762
00:44:44.976 --> 00:44:46.559
Rushworth regards fighters

763
00:44:46.643 --> 00:44:51.268
as a money-making apparatus
with no other value.

764
00:44:51.351 --> 00:44:53.059
I simply believe
that when one man wins.

765
00:44:53.143 --> 00:44:55.434
another loses.
The thrill. as it were.

766
00:44:55.518 --> 00:44:57.976
is being on the side
of the victor.

767
00:44:58.059 --> 00:44:59.684
Wouldn't you agree. Jem?

768
00:44:59.768 --> 00:45:01.184
[gulps] I do.

769
00:45:01.268 --> 00:45:02.518
Then who am I to disagree

770
00:45:02.601 --> 00:45:04.643
with the new champion
of England?

771
00:45:04.726 --> 00:45:06.309
Now. of course. pugilism
has been around

772
00:45:06.393 --> 00:45:08.101
since the ancient Greeks.

773
00:45:08.184 --> 00:45:11.476
when it was a sport
of natural beauty

774
00:45:11.559 --> 00:45:14.559
or an artform.
and could be again.

775
00:45:14.643 --> 00:45:15.893
All God's creatures
are furnished

776
00:45:15.976 --> 00:45:17.309
with appendages
for their protection.

777
00:45:17.393 --> 00:45:19.893
So. why not turn them
into instruments of profit?

778
00:45:19.976 --> 00:45:22.976
But every fighter
should be one step ahead...

779
00:45:23.059 --> 00:45:24.934
so he can turn this
into a proper sport.

780
00:45:25.018 --> 00:45:28.018
And you're quiet right.
Lord Ashford.

781
00:45:28.101 --> 00:45:30.143
It should be viewed
as an artform.

782
00:45:30.226 --> 00:45:32.059
I couldn't agree with you more.

783
00:45:32.143 --> 00:45:35.018
I will help arrange
your next fight. Jem.

784
00:45:35.101 --> 00:45:38.184
There isn't a door in this city
that's closed to a lord.

785
00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:41.018
Yeah. well. that's very kind
of you. my lord.

786
00:45:41.101 --> 00:45:42.309
But we're fine for now.

787
00:45:42.393 --> 00:45:45.518
When opportunity knocks.
one must answer.

788
00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:49.434
[indistinct chatter]

789
00:45:49.518 --> 00:45:51.143
Speaking of opportunity...

790
00:45:54.601 --> 00:45:55.434
Bill.

791
00:45:58.059 --> 00:45:59.184
Excuse me.

792
00:46:03.893 --> 00:46:06.434
He's like a dog
with two cocks.

793
00:46:06.518 --> 00:46:08.684
[chuckles]

794
00:46:08.768 --> 00:46:10.518
[indistinct chatter]

795
00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:12.768
Give my best wishes
to your lovely wife.

796
00:46:12.851 --> 00:46:14.393
And all the best to you.
Lady Abigail.

797
00:46:14.476 --> 00:46:15.809
Thank you.

798
00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:21.018
Mr. Belcher.

799
00:46:21.101 --> 00:46:22.559
-Come.
-Yeah.

800
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:26.726
[chuckles]

801
00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:28.434
So...

802
00:46:28.518 --> 00:46:31.476
is this your first exposure
to high society?

803
00:46:31.559 --> 00:46:33.018
It is.

804
00:46:33.101 --> 00:46:37.393
Well. the party was meant
to be for the Irishman.

805
00:46:37.476 --> 00:46:38.309
But...

806
00:46:39.351 --> 00:46:41.101
not sure he felt
like celebrating.

807
00:46:41.184 --> 00:46:42.768
[chuckles]

808
00:46:42.851 --> 00:46:44.393
You-- you saw the fight?

809
00:46:44.476 --> 00:46:45.893
Well and truly.

810
00:46:47.434 --> 00:46:48.976
Are women not permitted
at such events?

811
00:46:49.059 --> 00:46:51.851
[chuckles awkwardly]
Yes. of course. I mean...

812
00:46:51.934 --> 00:46:54.851
usually. I... I see
a different type of women

813
00:46:54.934 --> 00:46:57.059
at the... fight.

814
00:46:57.143 --> 00:46:58.851
[chuckles] I mean... well...

815
00:46:58.934 --> 00:47:00.518
Have I made you uncomfortable.
Jem?

816
00:47:02.226 --> 00:47:03.268
-No.
-[Lady Abigail chuckles]

817
00:47:03.351 --> 00:47:05.684
-Good.
-[chuckles]

818
00:47:05.768 --> 00:47:07.309
You'd be surprised
at how many women

819
00:47:07.393 --> 00:47:09.309
enjoy the spectacle.

820
00:47:09.393 --> 00:47:11.101
You'll find many women
in the crowds.

821
00:47:12.976 --> 00:47:14.684
You just have to take notice.

822
00:47:18.059 --> 00:47:20.059
-[chuckles]
-[indistinct chatter]

823
00:47:20.143 --> 00:47:21.184
The new champ toys have arrived.

824
00:47:21.268 --> 00:47:23.059
-Get me one.
-Make way.

825
00:47:23.143 --> 00:47:24.101
[grunts]

826
00:47:26.893 --> 00:47:29.309
Whoa! They look so real!

827
00:47:29.393 --> 00:47:34.393
[♪♪♪]

828
00:48:10.893 --> 00:48:12.643
In the meantime.
we'll have some fun.

829
00:48:12.726 --> 00:48:14.851
[smooches]

830
00:48:14.934 --> 00:48:16.309
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

831
00:48:18.684 --> 00:48:21.101
Classy dresser.

832
00:48:21.184 --> 00:48:22.101
Mm.

833
00:48:23.184 --> 00:48:24.101

[speaks Spanish]

839
00:48:33.934 --> 00:48:34.601
Huh?

840
00:48:34.684 --> 00:48:36.434
What are you drinking. Jem?

841
00:48:36.518 --> 00:48:37.434
Give me some.

842
00:48:39.601 --> 00:48:41.268
[chuckles]

843
00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:42.351
Champ.

844
00:48:47.268 --> 00:48:48.309
[smooches. chuckles]

845

00:48:54.268 --> 00:48:57.434
-Time!
-[grunts]

848
00:48:57.518 --> 00:48:59.351

[grunts]

854
00:49:15.518 --> 00:49:17.851
Loosen up.

855
00:49:17.934 --> 00:49:19.351
[grunts. groans]

856
00:49:19.434 --> 00:49:20.184
How daunting.

857
00:49:20.268 --> 00:49:21.268

858
00:49:21.351 --> 00:49:22.768

-[John groans]
-Yes!

860
00:49:23.726 --> 00:49:25.059
-[Jem grunts]
-Yes.

861
00:49:25.143 --> 00:49:26.268
-[crowd cheering]
-Hey!

862
00:49:26.351 --> 00:49:28.934
[laughs]

863
00:49:29.018 --> 00:49:30.809
Well done. well done!

864
00:49:30.893 --> 00:49:33.684
[chuckles]

865
00:49:35.934 --> 00:49:38.393
We need more of that.
Spectacle!

866
00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:40.643
[spits]

867
00:49:40.726 --> 00:49:42.143
[laughs]

868
00:49:42.226 --> 00:49:44.851
Well. that was a different
approach. wasn't it?

869
00:49:44.934 --> 00:49:46.143
Fantastic spectacle.

870
00:49:46.226 --> 00:49:47.309
Well done. well done.

871
00:49:49.518 --> 00:49:51.226
Mr. Warr.

872
00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:52.268
Hmm.

873
00:49:52.351 --> 00:49:55.351
[laughs]

874
00:49:56.851 --> 00:49:58.184
LORD RUSHWORTH:
So. Mr. Egan.

875
00:49:58.268 --> 00:50:00.768
will that demonstration
excite your readers?

876
00:50:00.851 --> 00:50:02.226
EGAN:
Indeed. my lord. it will.

877
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:04.893
[Rushworth laughs]

878
00:50:07.643 --> 00:50:08.934
DOCK SELLER:
Fresh bread!

879
00:50:09.018 --> 00:50:10.893
Come and get your fresh bread.

880
00:50:10.976 --> 00:50:13.268
Go on. step up. There you go.

881
00:50:13.351 --> 00:50:14.351
There’s two for you. darling.

882
00:50:14.434 --> 00:50:15.476
BOY:
There they are.
It's Jem's mum.

883
00:50:15.559 --> 00:50:16.559
DOCK SELLER:
Fresh bread. anyone?

884
00:50:16.643 --> 00:50:18.601
Come on. everyone. Fresh bread.

885
00:50:18.684 --> 00:50:21.309
Fresh bread. ladies?

886
00:50:21.393 --> 00:50:23.268
You must be proud of your boy.
Mary.

887
00:50:23.351 --> 00:50:26.351
Jem Belcher.
Champion of England.

888
00:50:26.434 --> 00:50:29.018
He beat Andrew Gamble
black and blue.

889
00:50:29.101 --> 00:50:30.726
GILLY:
Yeah. you're right.

890
00:50:33.726 --> 00:50:35.934
[inhales. exhales]

891
00:50:37.226 --> 00:50:39.018
Mm.

892
00:50:39.101 --> 00:50:41.018
Champion of England?

893
00:50:41.101 --> 00:50:42.101
Here. Ma.

894
00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:49.184
What's taking you so long?

895
00:50:49.268 --> 00:50:50.393
I'm just getting used to it.

896
00:50:50.476 --> 00:50:51.684
It's really very simple.

897
00:50:51.768 --> 00:50:54.143
You bet the checks
on your best five cards.

898
00:50:54.226 --> 00:50:57.143
What use is it to invent a game

899
00:50:57.226 --> 00:50:59.434
only to have it outlawed
a few years later?

900
00:50:59.518 --> 00:51:00.976
[chuckles] What do you expect?

901
00:51:01.059 --> 00:51:01.768
That's the French for you.

902
00:51:01.851 --> 00:51:03.726
Everything they do is backwards.

903
00:51:03.809 --> 00:51:06.268
Who do you suppose
will be your next opponent?

904
00:51:06.351 --> 00:51:08.184
That depends on who's left.

905
00:51:08.268 --> 00:51:10.809
The ring has invigorated
English life.

906
00:51:10.893 --> 00:51:13.143
A life you'll never find
in William Wordsworth.

907
00:51:13.226 --> 00:51:17.143
Fighting provides a stepladder
for a pauper to become a prince.

908
00:51:17.226 --> 00:51:19.976
I agree. But reading poetry should not be discounted

909
00:51:20.059 --> 00:51:21.893
as a worthy pursuit.

910
00:51:21.976 --> 00:51:24.768
I confess that I myself
have quite a penchant

911
00:51:24.851 --> 00:51:25.643
for Mr. Wordsworth.

912
00:51:25.726 --> 00:51:27.726
-So do Dandies.
-[laughs]

913
00:51:27.809 --> 00:51:31.268
Soon. there will be ranks
and weight classes.

914
00:51:31.351 --> 00:51:34.101
Men will need to reach
and earn a certain level

915
00:51:34.184 --> 00:51:35.851
before challenging anyone.

916
00:51:35.934 --> 00:51:36.893
Yes. a fight's a fight. Egan.

917
00:51:36.976 --> 00:51:39.684
Let's not get bogged down
in technicalities.

918
00:51:39.768 --> 00:51:41.143
[chuckles]

919
00:51:41.226 --> 00:51:42.643
On that note.

920
00:51:42.726 --> 00:51:43.601
[Ashford chuckles]

921
00:51:43.684 --> 00:51:46.393
I thought you were just
getting used to it.
