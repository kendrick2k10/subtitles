3
00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:40.351
I know you ain't done yet.

4
00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:43.396
You say you're all used up.

5
00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.816
but I know you still
got some gold left in ya.

6
00:02:58.763 --> 00:03:00.806
What in tarnation...

7
00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:05.621
Man: Howdy. sheriff.

8
00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.290
Uh-oh! You got me.

9
00:04:08.374 --> 00:04:09.583
Morning.

10
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.381
Charlotte: Daddy!

11
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:20.761
Look at you. sweetheart! All
bright and shiny. like a living doll.

12
00:04:20.845 --> 00:04:22.096
Give us a twirl.

13
00:04:22.388 --> 00:04:24.890
Whoo! Is this the wedding
dress? Can I have a sneak peek?

14
00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:28.144
Don't be a cheat. daddy. You'll
get a full preview on our big day.

15
00:04:28.227 --> 00:04:29.228
Angus: Very soon now.

16
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:31.147
Can you at least try
and make an effort?

17
00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:36.527
Angus. I see you made
the return trip as well.

18
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.156
A wedding generally is between a
woman and a man. sheriff pulsipher.

19
00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:43.534
Yes it is. and I can't wait
to meet that young man.

20
00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:45.828
Okay. daddy.

21
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:47.455
Listen to me.

22
00:04:47.538 --> 00:04:50.040
In five days. Angus will
be a part of this family

23
00:04:50.124 --> 00:04:51.500
whether you like it or not.

24
00:04:51.584 --> 00:04:53.335
What I'd like to see
is he's man enough

25
00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.212
to take over the reins
in protecting you.

26
00:04:55.296 --> 00:04:57.047
I mean. is he any good
with a barking iron?

27
00:04:57.131 --> 00:04:59.800
I want a husband. daddy.
Not a bodyguard.

28
00:04:59.884 --> 00:05:02.070
You've taught me how to take
good enough care of myself.

29
00:05:02.094 --> 00:05:04.847
He's taught me how to dissect
the words of dostoyevsky

30
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.682
and he's introduced me
to dickens and poe...

31
00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.810
You're not even married yet. and
you're already meeting with lawyers?

32
00:05:09.894 --> 00:05:11.187
Daddy. stop it.

33
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.441
Angus is a good soul who does
make me feel safe and secure.

34
00:05:15.524 --> 00:05:17.276
but most of all. happy.

35
00:05:17.693 --> 00:05:20.654
You're just afraid you won't be the
number one man in my life anymore.

36
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.580
You got him well-trained. Charlotte.
that's for sure.

37
00:05:25.326 --> 00:05:26.368
I'm right here.

38
00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:34.877
Inside.

39
00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.963
Zeke: Go get 'em. boys!
Round them up!

40
00:05:38.047 --> 00:05:39.381
Roy: It's the Samuels.

41
00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:45.846
Hurry it up. ladies.
I ain't got all day.

42
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.642
Anybody other than me comes
through those doors. you shoot 'em.

43
00:05:51.894 --> 00:05:52.937
Zeke: Move it. move it!

44
00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:54.563
Move it!

45
00:05:55.523 --> 00:05:57.608
Daddy? Angus.

46
00:05:57.733 --> 00:05:59.485
Homrhappydoes
hereahyrnakeyou? Daddy. go!

47
00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.450
You can come out now.

48
00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:09.870
Go. go!

49
00:06:16.961 --> 00:06:18.837
Move it! Man: Come on. let's go.

50
00:06:19.922 --> 00:06:21.173
Keep moving!

51
00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:24.718
Slim: First time
I made it on a poster.

52
00:06:24.802 --> 00:06:27.388
Hey! I'm handsome!

53
00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:29.473
Hands up!

54
00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.434
Come here.

55
00:06:33.811 --> 00:06:35.145
Stay down. Go!

56
00:07:39.043 --> 00:07:41.503
Don't mind. Happens to everyone.

57
00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:43.714
It's a crazy ride getting here.

58
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:46.592
See?

59
00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.677
I just saw the most...

60
00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:52.139
Hano: Beautiful. bright light you
ever did see? That'd be heaven.

61
00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.183
Heading towards it is a
good sign for your future.

62
00:07:54.266 --> 00:07:55.809
But you haven't
made it there yet.

63
00:07:55.893 --> 00:07:57.436
Hold on! Hold your damn horses.

64
00:07:58.771 --> 00:08:00.898
Did you say heaven?

65
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:02.441
I've read your file. Roy.

66
00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.151
I know everything about you

67
00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:05.914
and none of it says
you're hard of hearing.

68
00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.196
I'm dead?

69
00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:08.405
Mmm-hmm.

70
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.158
Charlotte? What about
my daughter. Charlotte?

71
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:14.036
Uh. hmm... negative.

72
00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:17.706
She's dead. She's dead.

73
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.625
No. no. Negative is positive.

74
00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.168
Negative means "not dead."

75
00:08:21.293 --> 00:08:23.545
Negative means "not dead"?

76
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:25.923
That is very confusing.
Change that.

77
00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:28.801
Butgood.

78
00:08:28.884 --> 00:08:31.178
She's got her wedding
at the end of the week.

79
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:32.638
It's in two days. actually.

80
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:33.806
Roy: Come again?

81
00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:35.683
You've been dead for three days.

82
00:08:35.766 --> 00:08:39.019
It takes a while for
upstairs to ratifyjudgement

83
00:08:39.103 --> 00:08:40.813
and send a soul
to where it belongs.

84
00:08:40.896 --> 00:08:42.147
You got sent to us.

85
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.442
Welcome to the ripd.

86
00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:47.695
The "rip..." What?

87
00:08:47.778 --> 00:08:49.571
"'D.' stands for "department."

88
00:08:49.655 --> 00:08:51.865
The "rip" is your standard
"rest in peace."

89
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:54.535
I'm the captain of the
west American division.

90
00:08:54.618 --> 00:08:55.911
Name's hano.

91
00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:59.581
See. we generally only get
soldiers. warriors and sheriffs

92
00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:01.583
who dearly depart
shuffled in here to us.

93
00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:03.544
At least the ones
deemed worthy enough

94
00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:07.172
to serve on god's own police force in
the ongoing fight against the deados.

95
00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:08.382
The what-os?

96
00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:09.675
The deados.

97
00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:12.845
Souls that escape theirjudgment
and hang around earth

98
00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:15.013
like the bad smell they are.

99
00:09:15.097 --> 00:09:17.766
Our job is to find them

100
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.270
and send them to where
their ticket got punched.

101
00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:24.898
Hell. Roy. We send them to hell.

102
00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:27.359
Heaven and hell?

103
00:09:27.443 --> 00:09:29.445
Whoo!

104
00:09:31.989 --> 00:09:34.092
Roy: So these souls that
escape their judgement in hell

105
00:09:34.116 --> 00:09:35.909
are what you call "deados."

106
00:09:35.993 --> 00:09:38.287
Not yet. A soul.
by its very definition.

107
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.747
is a spectral energy.

108
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.582
Disembodied. it's ineffectual.

109
00:09:41.665 --> 00:09:44.710
To sow the havoc a rogue soul
desires it needs a body.

110
00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.795
Wait. A human body?

111
00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:48.088
Exactly.

112
00:09:48.172 --> 00:09:51.175
And once it takes one over.
possesses it. if you will.

113
00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:52.926
then it becomes a problem.

114
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.430
Our problem. It becomes a deado.

115
00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:58.742
The more deados on earth. the
more unbalanced the natural order.

116
00:09:58.766 --> 00:09:59.846
threatening all human life.

117
00:10:00.726 --> 00:10:02.644
I think you're really
gonna like this.

118
00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:08.150
Whoo-wee.

119
00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:10.778
It's quite an impressive candy
store you got here.

120
00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:15.240
Roy: Oh. hello.

121
00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:17.075
Ain't you purdy.

122
00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.333
That's a very nice choice.

123
00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:27.836
Oh... no. no. no.
I can't be unfaithful.

124
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.507
When it comes to what I wear
on my hip. I'm a one-gun man.

125
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.092
Nothing comes between me
and my susie.

126
00:10:34.635 --> 00:10:35.969
That's my gun.

127
00:10:36.053 --> 00:10:37.596
I call her susie.

128
00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.681
I call her useless.

129
00:10:39.765 --> 00:10:41.892
Especially against deados.

130
00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:45.854
It'll stun them for a moment or
two. kind of like a nasty snake bite.

131
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.191
This. however.
more than does the job.

132
00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:52.361
With a head shot. these bullets
can exterminate a deado's soul.

133
00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:53.862
And your own.

134
00:10:53.946 --> 00:10:56.824
should the barrel end up
being pointed in your direction.

135
00:10:56.907 --> 00:10:58.992
Whoa. Good to know.

136
00:11:02.204 --> 00:11:04.206
What's with the.
uh. hungry snake?

137
00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:07.626
The uroboros signifies
life. death and rebirth.

138
00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:10.879
Deados may look like real
humans. but after possession.

139
00:11:10.963 --> 00:11:13.215
that symbol is branded
on their torso.

140
00:11:13.966 --> 00:11:15.843
This is a reminder
to all officers

141
00:11:15.926 --> 00:11:17.970
of the constant threat
we're up against.

142
00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:19.972
Right. Cut to the chase.
Why am I here?

143
00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:23.267
Roy. do you remember that
total eclipse about a month ago?

144
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.061
Well. there was an abnormal
rupture at a gateway near red creek.

145
00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.938
an old mining town in Utah.

146
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:31.024
"Abnormal." because it
registered with us as a kind of

147
00:11:31.817 --> 00:11:33.694
hellish discharge.

148
00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:35.195
I know an old quack back at home

149
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:38.657
who has a remedy for "hellish
discharges." if you know what I mean.

150
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.492
Duly noted. but not
what we're looking for.

151
00:11:40.576 --> 00:11:43.787
You. however. know that
terrain better than most.

152
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:46.748
You sign up. we'll get you
back to earth right away

153
00:11:46.832 --> 00:11:48.333
to check it all out.

154
00:11:48.417 --> 00:11:50.252
Now. that's a carrot
worth the dangle.

155
00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:54.089
If I get to go back to earth.
sign me up and count me in!

156
00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:56.592
I know what's going on
in that noggin of yours. Roy.

157
00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.303
Everyone in your position
thinks the same thing.

158
00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:01.763
But revenge for your murder
is not the mission.

159
00:12:01.847 --> 00:12:03.557
Getting to red creek is.

160
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.601
Let sleeping dogs lie.

161
00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:08.604
You're a dead man. Nothing
we can do can change that.

162
00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:09.938
Now. before you read and sign.

163
00:12:10.022 --> 00:12:11.773
you should know
the standard service term...

164
00:12:11.857 --> 00:12:14.192
I already said I'm in.
Let's seal the deal.

165
00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:15.903
Oh.

166
00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:17.112
Send me back.

167
00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:34.046
You branded me
like a damn steer.

168
00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:35.130
Moo.

169
00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:38.050
Now giddy up. cowboy.
It's time to move.

170
00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:40.052
Oh! Watch the bread box.

171
00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:41.970
Sorry. People got taller
over time.

172
00:12:42.054 --> 00:12:44.973
We'd like to replace it but. you
know. budgetary constraints.

173
00:12:46.058 --> 00:12:47.476
The clock's ticking. Roy.

174
00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:50.520
In two days. a blood moon
will rise.

175
00:12:50.604 --> 00:12:53.231
And in the Bible. when that
follows a blue moon eclipse.

176
00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:54.900
it can only mean one thing.

177
00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:57.152
A hoot of a time
for astronomers?

178
00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.738
The end of times.

179
00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:01.281
Hmm.

180
00:13:29.518 --> 00:13:30.769
What the...

181
00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:32.813
Oh. fancy.

182
00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:17.232
Jeanne: That's the good thing
about dying.

183
00:14:18.567 --> 00:14:20.152
It can only happen once.

184
00:14:20.944 --> 00:14:23.071
You must be sheriff pulsipher.

185
00:14:23.155 --> 00:14:24.448
In all my glory.

186
00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:27.367
I have seen glory
and I don't think you are it.

187
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:30.871
Just who might you be?

188
00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:31.997
Jeanne: Jeanne.

189
00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:33.123
The name is Jeanne.

190
00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:35.834
Roy: Listen. Jane.
I don't do partners.

191
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:39.379
Hano charged me with looking after
you. and I don't go against orders.

192
00:14:39.463 --> 00:14:40.672
I don't need no looking after.

193
00:14:40.756 --> 00:14:42.257
And I don't need
a fourth partner.

194
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.943
Four partners?
Where are your other three?

195
00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:48.263
Everywhere. The father.
son and the holy ghost.

196
00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:52.267
Yeah. those three gun slingers?

197
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.437
They don't come in real handy
when you need backup in fire fight.

198
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.774
I don't need backup with a gun
when I'm unbeatable with a sword.

199
00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.110
Let's make one thing clear.

200
00:15:02.194 --> 00:15:04.863
I got seniority
in this here arrangement.

201
00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.782
I got at least 20 years on ya.

202
00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:08.033
If we were alive.

203
00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:10.619
But you have been dead
for three days.

204
00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:14.873
162.425.

205
00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:17.584
Or 445 years.

206
00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.045
How senior do you feel now?

207
00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:22.172
Hell with this. Hee-ya!

208
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.430
Zeke: Iain't gonna
ask you again.

209
00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:34.226
I said. get in line.

210
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:35.894
Come on now. daddy.

211
00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:38.647
Bank manager: No
need to hurt me. I mean. us.

212
00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.982
I'll get you all
what I have in the safe.

213
00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:42.943
We ain't here for your money.

214
00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:45.654
This is a bank.
What else do you want?

215
00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:46.822
Them.

216
00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:50.784
Yeah. we want people. You
got any of them in your safe?

217
00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:52.536
'Cause. we'll take 'em all. Oh!

218
00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.414
Slim: I'm sorry about that.

219
00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:58.601
You're the sorriest son-of-a-bitch
we ever had the misfortune

220
00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.418
of getting stuck with.
The law is coming.

221
00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:04.089
God damn. they brought
the whole cavalry this time.

222
00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:06.383
You three stay here.
Hold them off.

223
00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.135
Catch back up with us later.
Got it.

224
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.014
Damn it!

225
00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:14.474
Hee-ya!

226
00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:22.852
Jeanne:
You don't need a partner.

227
00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:24.753
and I don't need
a stray dog. Roy.

228
00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:26.546
Now let's go.

229
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.550
You're not gonna stop me
from seeing my daughter.

230
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.591
Now. listen.

231
00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:34.095
That was unexpected.

232
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.390
You know.
I've never hit a woman.

233
00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:40.274
But you come between me and my
Charlotte. there's gonna be hell to pay.

234
00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:48.235
Faster than when
you were alive. huh?

235
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.897
I can't let you go see her.

236
00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:27.107
Why not?

237
00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.567
Because you...

238
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.655
Aren't you anymore.

239
00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:00.640
So this is me now?

240
00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.893
To everyone on earth. anyway.

241
00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.534
You always said I needed to be more
in touch with my feminine side. Millie.

242
00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:21.202
If you could only see me now.

243
00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:28.668
Breaks my heart. my daughter
will never know me again.

244
00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:32.922
The ripd gave you a second
chance to restore order to the world.

245
00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.716
Not your old life.

246
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:37.260
That's why we don't return
as ourselves.

247
00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:39.888
It would be too confusing
for anyone who knew us.

248
00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:42.015
This is 1876 america.

249
00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:43.909
If you haven't noticed.
folks around these parts

250
00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:45.393
ain't too broad-minded.

251
00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:48.355
Few people are gonna talk to
us. let alone even listen to us.

252
00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:49.981
looking the way we do.

253
00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:52.525
Why do that? Make
ourjob that much harder?

254
00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:56.071
Maybe the eternal one thought
you could learn a thing or two.

255
00:19:56.154 --> 00:19:58.365
Walking in shoes of those
deemed less advantaged.

256
00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:00.450
Come on. now.
I have learned plenty.

257
00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:01.993
My best friend is black.

258
00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:05.372
And my daughter is a woman.

259
00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:07.082
Just because you know them.

260
00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:10.043
does not mean you understand
what it's like to be them.

261
00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:13.838
We'll say we're sisters.

262
00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:15.131
Bounty hunters.

263
00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:17.592
That should get us some respect.

264
00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.262
I can't believe
that this here body

265
00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:25.392
is right there. buried.
under my feet.

266
00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:26.476
Well...

267
00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:28.895
Well what?

268
00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:32.148
It's true that part of you
was buried under there.

269
00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:33.233
Part of me?

270
00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:35.902
The parts they could find.
After you were shot.

271
00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:39.948
I think buried here
is a foot. a shoulder.

272
00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:42.742
your ear. maybe. and your...

273
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.412
My ass? Yes.

274
00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:47.288
They found your ass. too.

275
00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:48.456
Where is the rest of me?

276
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.707
In a cave. apparently.

277
00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:52.585
Some coyotes got to
you. Roy. Some coyotes?

278
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.963
They were hungry. and you
were dead. Hungry coyotes.

279
00:20:55.046 --> 00:20:56.631
I heard they had
some small babies.

280
00:20:56.714 --> 00:20:58.591
Small. hungry. baby coyotes.

281
00:20:58.675 --> 00:20:59.801
So. you helped them survive.

282
00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.177
It's a beautiful thing.

283
00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:03.012
to be a part of the
food chain. Shut up.

284
00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:04.536
Circle of life...
Stop. Stop talking.

285
00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:10.395
Where are you going. Roy?
My skin might have changed.

286
00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.078
but my heart and soul
are still the same.

287
00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:14.149
I know I can make
my daughter recognize me.

288
00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:16.943
You can't communicate with
loved ones anymore either.

289
00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:19.112
Anything you say to her

290
00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:22.782
will only come out
as an incoherent gibberish.

291
00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:27.537
So. not only will my daughter
not recognize me.

292
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.248
she won't understand a lick
of what I'm saying. either?

293
00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:33.084
This is some bullshit.

294
00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:39.632
I know exactly
how you feel. ma'am.

295
00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:41.926
I understand your pain.

296
00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:44.888
It's good to let it all out.

297
00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:48.850
You've come to pay your respects
to the late sheriff. too. then?

298
00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:52.937
I can't say I've seen you
ladies around these parts before.

299
00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:55.482
Do you know this man?
That is Henry.

300
00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:56.941
My friend I was talking about.

301
00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:58.865
We've known each other
since we were knee-high.

302
00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:03.698
Name's matilde. father.

303
00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:08.161
And this here is my
mute sister. Mabel.

304
00:22:10.038 --> 00:22:11.915
We only met the sheriff once.

305
00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:15.126
He. uh. helped us
with our broken down wagon.

306
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:19.672
I must admit. I didn't take
much of a shine to him.

307
00:22:19.756 --> 00:22:21.216
nor him to me.

308
00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:25.220
In fact. he seemed quite
self-absorbed. if you ask me.

309
00:22:26.012 --> 00:22:30.600
The kind of man that wanted to
control every situation he was in

310
00:22:30.683 --> 00:22:34.521
no matter how out of
his depth he truly was.

311
00:22:35.188 --> 00:22:37.732
But Mabel. well.

312
00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:41.277
she seemed to think he
was something really special.

313
00:22:41.361 --> 00:22:44.948
Well. we're all entitled to our
own points of view. I guess.

314
00:22:45.031 --> 00:22:49.160
But I may have to side with
miss Mabel over here on this one.

315
00:22:49.244 --> 00:22:51.663
That man was special.

316
00:22:51.746 --> 00:22:54.332
Far from perfect. of course.

317
00:22:54.415 --> 00:22:56.751
But. special nonetheless.

318
00:22:56.834 --> 00:22:59.754
I mean. was he a little
arrogant?

319
00:22:59.837 --> 00:23:01.089
No doubt.

320
00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:04.717
Did he think that
he had the answers

321
00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:06.886
before the questions
were even asked?

322
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.098
That was Roy. to a tee.

323
00:23:10.557 --> 00:23:12.517
Pigheaded? Ha!

324
00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:16.062
Stubborn as an ornery mule.
more like it.

325
00:23:17.063 --> 00:23:18.690
Boy. was Roy loyal.

326
00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:24.612
To his family. this town. to me.

327
00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:28.950
There is no one you wanted
more to have your back.

328
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:32.912
Makes me wonder how we're gonna
stand on our own two feet without him.

329
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.250
Especially against the evil likes
of them Samuels that did Roy in

330
00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:39.586
and took poor
Charlotte's fiance.

331
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.796
amongst others.

332
00:23:41.879 --> 00:23:44.215
Least they caught
three of them five reprobates

333
00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:45.842
holding up a bank today.

334
00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:49.095
Federal marshals will be
transferring them to laramie.

335
00:23:49.721 --> 00:23:52.140
It's the hangman's noose
for them boys now.

336
00:23:52.223 --> 00:23:54.851
Mmm-mmm. No. no. They
are moving them to laramie.

337
00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:57.614
They gotta pass through snake
gully and that's where we'll hit them.

338
00:23:58.896 --> 00:24:01.608
I have indulged
your little identity crisis.

339
00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:03.610
But we must get to red creek.

340
00:24:03.693 --> 00:24:05.194
Didn't you hear Henry?

341
00:24:05.278 --> 00:24:07.238
The Samuels took Angus.

342
00:24:07.322 --> 00:24:10.658
And that is an issue for the
earthly authorities to solve.

343
00:24:10.742 --> 00:24:11.951
not us.

344
00:24:12.035 --> 00:24:13.995
Gateways. portals. deados.

345
00:24:14.078 --> 00:24:16.539
That is yourjurisdiction now.
officer.

346
00:24:16.623 --> 00:24:17.790
Out of my way.

347
00:24:17.874 --> 00:24:22.045
The world could be at stake and
you care only about saving one man.

348
00:24:22.587 --> 00:24:24.339
Not just any man.

349
00:24:24.422 --> 00:24:27.967
The man that makes my daughter
the happiest in the world.

350
00:24:28.051 --> 00:24:29.802
And for me.
my daughter is my world.

351
00:24:29.886 --> 00:24:31.137
Was your world.

352
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.597
You are dead.

353
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.308
You'll get used to using
the past tense.

354
00:24:35.391 --> 00:24:37.894
Hey. Jenny. would you go
walk around on my grave?

355
00:24:37.977 --> 00:24:39.354
With pleasure.

356
00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.481
Wait. why?

357
00:24:41.564 --> 00:24:43.250
'Cause ifyou're gonna be
such a pain in my ass.

358
00:24:43.274 --> 00:24:44.901
you might as well
be standing on it!

359
00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:46.486
Goodbye. Mabel.

360
00:24:46.569 --> 00:24:48.237
Take good care now.

361
00:24:48.321 --> 00:24:50.323
Right. Mabel.

362
00:24:59.207 --> 00:25:00.917
Marshal: Settle down
back there. boys.

363
00:25:02.418 --> 00:25:03.503
Settle down.

364
00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:12.845
Stubborn as an ornery mule.

365
00:25:12.929 --> 00:25:15.223
Well. if that isn't
the understatement

366
00:25:15.306 --> 00:25:17.850
of my many years
of after-life service.

367
00:25:17.934 --> 00:25:19.977
How you feel about me is nothing

368
00:25:20.061 --> 00:25:23.147
compared to my disposition
for those Samuel brothers.

369
00:25:23.231 --> 00:25:26.234
The damndest thing.
not too long ago.

370
00:25:26.317 --> 00:25:28.820
those boys were good
and god-fearing.

371
00:25:28.903 --> 00:25:29.904
Then just like that...

372
00:25:29.987 --> 00:25:32.490
Bad. Turned. Rotten to the core.

373
00:25:32.573 --> 00:25:34.117
Old Doris Samuel said

374
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.869
her four boys
and adopted son. slim.

375
00:25:36.953 --> 00:25:39.956
went out to work an old well
one day on their farm.

376
00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:42.417
and came back that night
a crazy bunch of no-goods.

377
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.378
She always said it was like.
they weren't her boys no more.

378
00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:49.507
Also. Henry said three of
the five Samuels were caught.

379
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.342
There should have been
only four left.

380
00:25:51.426 --> 00:25:53.970
I pegged their leader. Zeke.
before I was killed.

381
00:25:55.346 --> 00:25:57.181
Nobody could have
survived that shot.

382
00:25:57.849 --> 00:26:01.769
Maybe you're not the sharp shot
you thought you were. Annie oakley.

383
00:26:01.853 --> 00:26:05.314
I can shoot the sting
off a hornet from 50 feet.

384
00:26:06.399 --> 00:26:09.193
Jeanne: Your humility
is a virtue to behold.

385
00:26:09.277 --> 00:26:10.486
Roy: Thank you.

386
00:26:11.738 --> 00:26:13.030
Marshal: Hoo!

387
00:26:13.114 --> 00:26:14.115
Here they come.

388
00:26:15.116 --> 00:26:17.034
Told you they'd pass this way.

389
00:26:17.118 --> 00:26:18.202
Marshal: Make it quick.

390
00:26:18.536 --> 00:26:19.662
Now's our chance.

391
00:26:25.835 --> 00:26:27.420
Don't you worry none. fellas.

392
00:26:27.503 --> 00:26:29.756
We'll be getting you to that
judge soon enough.

393
00:26:29.839 --> 00:26:34.510
Just your exploits in this region
alone will see you swinging by Sunday.

394
00:26:41.642 --> 00:26:42.894
Sure you don't wanna go?

395
00:26:43.478 --> 00:26:44.645
It's a great spot.

396
00:26:48.816 --> 00:26:50.568
I feel light as a feather.

397
00:26:51.194 --> 00:26:53.362
What are you doing? We
got the element of surprise!

398
00:26:53.446 --> 00:26:54.447
Look.

399
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.282
Holy shit!

400
00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:57.366
The uroboros!

401
00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:59.136
Jeanne: You may not be
such a bad shot after all. Roy.

402
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.496
But you couldn't have killed
that which was already dead.

403
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:05.958
Doris Samuels didn't think her sons
came home that night because they didn't.

404
00:27:06.042 --> 00:27:09.837
Rogue souls that escaped judgement
must have been hiding in that well.

405
00:27:09.921 --> 00:27:12.965
And possessed the brothers
and made them deados.

406
00:27:13.049 --> 00:27:16.761
And this just
became ourjurisdiction.

407
00:27:16.844 --> 00:27:20.139
Help! Help me. misters!

408
00:27:20.223 --> 00:27:21.557
Please.

409
00:27:22.308 --> 00:27:23.851
It's my sister!

410
00:27:23.935 --> 00:27:26.354
She's hurt real bad.

411
00:27:26.437 --> 00:27:28.481
She's a bit slow. you see.

412
00:27:28.564 --> 00:27:30.483
and doesn't have
a keen sense of direction.

413
00:27:30.566 --> 00:27:34.862
Fact. she don't much have a keen
sense of anything at all right now.

414
00:27:34.946 --> 00:27:35.947
truth be told.

415
00:27:36.531 --> 00:27:38.449
She slipped from the top
of the canyon.

416
00:27:38.533 --> 00:27:40.701
Banged herself up real good.

417
00:27:40.785 --> 00:27:42.095
Marshal: Now.
you hold it right there.

418
00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:44.372
We do not have the time
nor the disposition

419
00:27:44.455 --> 00:27:45.957
to help the likes of you.

420
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.418
Guess you don't have
the disposition

421
00:27:49.502 --> 00:27:52.421
for no Morgan silver
then neither.

422
00:27:53.464 --> 00:27:54.841
Hey. fellas.

423
00:27:54.924 --> 00:27:56.968
See if you can help
the little lady out.

424
00:28:02.723 --> 00:28:04.016
Jeanne: Okay. then.

425
00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:05.560
Thank you.

426
00:28:06.561 --> 00:28:07.562
You're real saints.

427
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:38.509
Marshal: Hey fellas.
we gotta go.

428
00:28:39.385 --> 00:28:41.429
Leave 'em to die if you have to.

429
00:28:42.471 --> 00:28:44.390
Just make sure
you grab the silver.

430
00:28:47.518 --> 00:28:48.519
Fehas?

431
00:28:55.526 --> 00:28:57.111
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

432
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:21.844
Whoa! I got her! I got her!

433
00:29:21.928 --> 00:29:23.179
You go check!

434
00:29:28.935 --> 00:29:30.269
Yeah. you got her.

435
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.271
That's for damn sure.

436
00:29:36.859 --> 00:29:38.486
But I can't see no bullet hole.

437
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:41.405
Boo!

438
00:29:41.822 --> 00:29:43.074
Jeanne: Hey. marshal.

439
00:29:43.157 --> 00:29:45.284
Still want that silver?

440
00:29:46.202 --> 00:29:49.246
Roy: That's the thing about
dying. it can only happen once.

441
00:29:50.039 --> 00:29:52.625
Ow. Just like a snake bite.

442
00:29:58.172 --> 00:30:00.007
Damn strong lock.

443
00:30:04.345 --> 00:30:07.223
Search him again!

444
00:30:07.306 --> 00:30:09.433
I'm telling you.
the key must have got lost

445
00:30:09.517 --> 00:30:12.895
while you were busy assaulting
us us federal marshals.

446
00:30:15.439 --> 00:30:18.275
No! These ain't mine! Oh. god!

447
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.194
So what now?

448
00:30:23.948 --> 00:30:25.491
We're gonna have
to pop one of them.

449
00:30:26.409 --> 00:30:27.410
Pop what now?

450
00:30:30.413 --> 00:30:33.290
Roy: You gonna partake in a
little moonshine with our captives?

451
00:30:33.374 --> 00:30:34.875
This isn't moonshine.

452
00:30:35.376 --> 00:30:38.504
But for deados.
something far more torturous.

453
00:31:16.709 --> 00:31:19.086
Once popped.
he's got to be stopped.

454
00:31:28.888 --> 00:31:30.014
What the...

455
00:31:37.146 --> 00:31:38.981
Holy shit.

456
00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.192
No. water.

457
00:31:41.275 --> 00:31:42.902
Blessed by the almighty.

458
00:31:42.985 --> 00:31:46.822
Once they've possessed a human.
deados hate revealing their true selves.

459
00:31:46.906 --> 00:31:48.824
The pain is unbearable.

460
00:31:48.908 --> 00:31:51.368
Holy water speeds up
the process.

461
00:31:51.452 --> 00:31:53.871
Uh. where are the other two?

462
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:55.998
Oh. there's one.

463
00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:00.544
Jeanne: Like I said.

464
00:32:00.628 --> 00:32:03.130
in a gunfight.
all I need is my sword.

465
00:32:03.631 --> 00:32:05.299
Let's go. deado filth.

466
00:32:19.313 --> 00:32:20.481
Son of a...

467
00:32:20.564 --> 00:32:21.899
What?

468
00:32:21.982 --> 00:32:24.860
What? Don't you
"what. what" me. boy.

469
00:32:24.944 --> 00:32:27.279
You was the one that sent me
to the bone orchard

470
00:32:27.363 --> 00:32:30.157
with a slug to the back
of the skull. ya damn coward!

471
00:32:30.241 --> 00:32:32.535
Ma'am! I've no idea who you are!

472
00:32:32.618 --> 00:32:34.578
He doesn't recognize you.
roycephus.

473
00:32:35.538 --> 00:32:37.224
Roycephus?
Her name is roycephus?

474
00:32:37.248 --> 00:32:38.374
Oh!

475
00:32:38.457 --> 00:32:39.959
I saw it on your tombstone.

476
00:32:40.042 --> 00:32:41.919
It is a pretty funny name.
Is it Roman?

477
00:32:42.002 --> 00:32:44.797
It means noble and kind!

478
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.924
Neither of which
I'm feeling at the moment.

479
00:32:47.007 --> 00:32:49.176
as I stare into the eyes
of my murderer.

480
00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.469
No! Whoa. whoa. Slow down!

481
00:32:50.553 --> 00:32:53.347
Now I know sheriff pulsipher
was shot near the train that day.

482
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:54.723
but I've no idea who did it.

483
00:32:54.807 --> 00:32:55.850
You did it!

484
00:32:55.933 --> 00:32:58.519
It was you! You shot
me from inside the train!

485
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:00.688
Nah. that bill
is a load of bosh.

486
00:33:00.771 --> 00:33:01.931
Someone's trying to frame me!

487
00:33:02.356 --> 00:33:03.357
Okay.

488
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.360
Cool. cool. so clearly.
you can't see our true selves.

489
00:33:06.443 --> 00:33:08.028
But can you see these weapons?

490
00:33:08.112 --> 00:33:09.196
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. I see them.

491
00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.325
Good. 'cause this pistol is the
last thing you're ever gonna see!

492
00:33:13.409 --> 00:33:14.702
Adios. deados!

493
00:33:14.785 --> 00:33:17.121
No. What about
getting him to talk?

494
00:33:17.204 --> 00:33:19.748
Think about your daughter.
About Angus.

495
00:33:19.832 --> 00:33:21.500
They're the reason
we're here. right?

496
00:33:22.459 --> 00:33:23.711
God damn it!

497
00:33:27.464 --> 00:33:29.304
What did you do with
the people from the train?

498
00:33:29.383 --> 00:33:30.384
Eat a horn toad!

499
00:33:34.388 --> 00:33:35.931
Mmm-hmm. Oh. boy.

500
00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:56.577
Come on out!

501
00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.995
Any more. and he'll pop.

502
00:33:58.078 --> 00:34:00.122
I'll talk. Please!

503
00:34:11.133 --> 00:34:12.509
Roy: Go on. then. Talk.

504
00:34:13.302 --> 00:34:15.471
Slim: Okay. Okay. okay.
There's this deado.

505
00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:18.182
The worst I've ever seen.
Goes by the name Otis.

506
00:34:18.265 --> 00:34:21.977
Otis claiborne.
And he ain't like most deados.

507
00:34:22.061 --> 00:34:23.479
He's more powerful.

508
00:34:23.562 --> 00:34:26.690
He forced me and the souls
that took over the other Samuels

509
00:34:26.774 --> 00:34:29.777
to kidnap people
and deliver them to red creek.

510
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.488
Red creek? As in
red creek. Utah?

511
00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:33.822
Slim: Yeah.

512
00:34:34.406 --> 00:34:37.952
Maybe this little diversion
wasn't a waste of time. after all.

513
00:34:38.577 --> 00:34:41.413
And how long you been
rounding up folks for this Otis'?

514
00:34:41.497 --> 00:34:43.958
About a month.
Since he showed up.

515
00:34:44.041 --> 00:34:46.794
That's around the same time
as the gateway rupture.

516
00:34:46.877 --> 00:34:51.006
You reckon this Otis could be the
"hellish discharge" hano was on about?

517
00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.259
Souls can escape
on their way into hell

518
00:34:53.342 --> 00:34:55.344
but none have ever
gotten back out.

519
00:34:55.427 --> 00:34:58.264
What business does this Otis
have with the kidnapped folk?

520
00:34:58.347 --> 00:35:00.349
He's locking them up.
Keeping them healthy.

521
00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:02.726
He's got something
big planned. That's for sure.

522
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.312
And it's goin' down soon.
That's all I know!

523
00:35:05.396 --> 00:35:07.273
Means Angus
might still be alive.

524
00:35:07.898 --> 00:35:11.527
Look. we was just trying
to lay low from you ripd.

525
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:15.406
But Otis has a real
scary way about him.

526
00:35:15.489 --> 00:35:17.408
I ain't proud of what I done.

527
00:35:17.491 --> 00:35:20.953
but he threatened to wipe
us all out if we didn't help.

528
00:35:21.036 --> 00:35:23.580
And how exactly
was he going to do that?

529
00:35:23.664 --> 00:35:25.958
Deados can't wipe out
other deados.

530
00:35:28.252 --> 00:35:29.586
With one of those. they can.

531
00:35:30.504 --> 00:35:35.050
Now why would this Otis fella
have himself an ripd equalizer?

532
00:35:35.134 --> 00:35:38.262
I don't know. But it's not good.

533
00:35:39.305 --> 00:35:40.723
We need to get to red creek.

534
00:36:15.758 --> 00:36:18.260
That deado crew has returned.

535
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:21.055
But they only brought back
eight more.

536
00:36:23.015 --> 00:36:26.685
I'll get them to do one
last run before midnight.

537
00:36:26.769 --> 00:36:30.481
Their leader said they're
done. For good this time.

538
00:36:30.564 --> 00:36:34.151
Seems they want out before
any ripd start moving in.

539
00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.111
Isthatso?

540
00:36:37.696 --> 00:36:39.239
What else did he say?

541
00:36:39.323 --> 00:36:42.743
He doesn't think we should all
be following you with such...

542
00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:44.620
Blind faith.

543
00:36:45.621 --> 00:36:47.498
They are questioning
your origins.

544
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.958
Who you say you really are.

545
00:36:51.043 --> 00:36:52.252
And you?

546
00:36:52.336 --> 00:36:55.089
Do you doubt who I say I am?

547
00:36:57.216 --> 00:36:58.384
It's just...

548
00:37:00.135 --> 00:37:02.096
They're questioning
how you got out.

549
00:37:21.323 --> 00:37:23.575
As one of the three.
I had the freedom

550
00:37:23.659 --> 00:37:25.744
to roam all circles
of the underworld.

551
00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:29.998
I escaped through limbo
during that full moon eclipse

552
00:37:30.082 --> 00:37:32.334
when a fragment of
the gateway grew weak.

553
00:37:34.044 --> 00:37:38.132
Now. tonight's blood moon
completes a tetradic lunar cycle.

554
00:37:38.215 --> 00:37:42.177
making the entire gateway
weak and vulnerable at midnight.

555
00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.433
That's when we put
the humans to work.

556
00:37:48.684 --> 00:37:50.686
It gives them six hours to toil

557
00:37:50.769 --> 00:37:53.272
until the gateway strengthens
again at dawn.

558
00:37:53.355 --> 00:37:56.567
making it impossible
to penetrate once more.

559
00:37:57.943 --> 00:38:01.113
This is why we need
as many hands as we can get.

560
00:38:02.614 --> 00:38:04.074
Because if they fail...

561
00:38:05.033 --> 00:38:06.869
It will be another
quarter of a century

562
00:38:06.952 --> 00:38:10.164
before the gateway
is at its weakest once again.

563
00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:16.962
I was tired of fighting
for control down below.

564
00:38:18.213 --> 00:38:21.341
I escaped to rule over my
own dominion here on earth.

565
00:38:21.425 --> 00:38:24.803
I can barely wait a few hours.
let alone a quarter of a century.

566
00:38:27.556 --> 00:38:28.765
Now you tell me.

567
00:38:31.768 --> 00:38:34.813
Do I also have to fight for
your belief in me as well?

568
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.191
No. I'm with you.

569
00:38:38.525 --> 00:38:39.526
I am.

570
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.362
I believe you can deliver us
hell on earth.

571
00:38:43.071 --> 00:38:44.072
But...

572
00:38:44.156 --> 00:38:45.324
But what?

573
00:38:46.033 --> 00:38:48.118
I can no longer speak
for the others.

574
00:38:49.703 --> 00:38:52.623
Well. let's go open
everyone's eyes. then.

575
00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:55.584
If you're gonna put faith in me.

576
00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:57.753
inolonger want it to be blind.

577
00:38:59.379 --> 00:39:01.006
Hmm.

578
00:39:08.639 --> 00:39:12.518
Roy: Are you sure we can't just pop
this dead weight? He's holding us back.

579
00:39:12.601 --> 00:39:15.145
Jeanne:
Execution is not ripd policy.

580
00:39:15.229 --> 00:39:17.773
Once we're done. hano will
have him redirected back to hell.

581
00:39:17.856 --> 00:39:19.566
His fate has already
been sealed.

582
00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:22.528
Just put me on the back
of the horse. miss horciphus.

583
00:39:22.611 --> 00:39:24.112
We'll get there much quicker.

584
00:39:24.196 --> 00:39:26.490
I'll hold on to you
real tight. I promise.

585
00:39:26.573 --> 00:39:31.119
We'll keep each other nice and toasty.
huh? What do you say?

586
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:34.164
Roy: I'll give him a fighting
chance. Ten seconds start.

587
00:39:34.248 --> 00:39:35.874
He did kill me. after all.

588
00:39:35.958 --> 00:39:39.336
Jeanne: "The best revenge is to
be unlike him who caused the injury."

589
00:39:39.795 --> 00:39:41.672
Roy: You quoting
the Bible on me now?

590
00:39:41.755 --> 00:39:44.049
Jeanne: No.
Marcus aurelius said that.

591
00:39:44.132 --> 00:39:46.468
Like you. he was a Roman. too.

592
00:39:46.552 --> 00:39:49.763
Roycephus ain't Roman.
It's a family name.

593
00:39:49.846 --> 00:39:52.599
Jeanne: Okay. I got it.
Message received.

594
00:39:52.683 --> 00:39:55.769
Don't you mean "Roy-ceiphed"?
Message "Roy-ceiphed."

595
00:39:55.852 --> 00:39:58.939
Get it? 'Cause
your name is royceph...

596
00:40:01.066 --> 00:40:02.901
Oh! Here come the snake bites.
Snake what?

597
00:40:02.985 --> 00:40:05.070
Ow! Ow!

598
00:40:06.446 --> 00:40:08.282
I'm sorry. okay? Damn!

599
00:40:11.702 --> 00:40:14.496
I'm gonna file a complaint
when you take me in.

600
00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:18.417
Speaking of fate.
I gotta thank you.

601
00:40:19.209 --> 00:40:23.213
For. uh. saving my life
back at the canyon.

602
00:40:24.256 --> 00:40:25.674
He had me dead to rights.

603
00:40:26.425 --> 00:40:28.635
That wasn't easy for you.
was it?

604
00:40:29.219 --> 00:40:31.972
Admitting you can't do it alone.

605
00:40:32.055 --> 00:40:34.450
I'm not admitting anything. I'm just
saying thanks for having my back.

606
00:40:34.474 --> 00:40:35.475
Don't make this awkward.

607
00:40:35.559 --> 00:40:36.560
You're welcome.

608
00:40:36.643 --> 00:40:38.645
But it wasn't your life
that I saved back there.

609
00:40:39.771 --> 00:40:41.565
But something
far more important.

610
00:40:42.858 --> 00:40:43.859
Your soul.

611
00:40:46.194 --> 00:40:48.822
So tell me.
your dearly departed Millie.

612
00:40:48.905 --> 00:40:50.991
do you think she ended
"up" or "down"?

613
00:40:51.533 --> 00:40:54.161
Well seeing how I was
heading to the pearly gates.

614
00:40:54.244 --> 00:40:57.831
that damn fine woman probably
has a seat in the front row.

615
00:40:57.914 --> 00:40:58.957
Hmm.

616
00:40:59.082 --> 00:41:00.667
Looking forward to joining her.

617
00:41:02.085 --> 00:41:04.087
Hopefully.
she is waiting for you.

618
00:41:05.672 --> 00:41:07.257
Oh. hey!

619
00:41:08.592 --> 00:41:11.178
What's that now? Oh. nothing.

620
00:41:12.179 --> 00:41:13.764
It's just... it's just what?

621
00:41:13.847 --> 00:41:17.726
It's just there are
a lot of good men in heaven.

622
00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:18.935
Very good men.

623
00:41:19.645 --> 00:41:21.688
Good looking. so I hear.

624
00:41:22.397 --> 00:41:24.399
Maybe she moved on.

625
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:26.109
They can do that?

626
00:41:26.193 --> 00:41:27.235
Yeah.

627
00:41:28.362 --> 00:41:29.905
Roy and slim: Damn!

628
00:41:33.575 --> 00:41:35.118
I thought when I died.

629
00:41:35.202 --> 00:41:38.288
Millie and I would be
together for eternity.

630
00:41:38.538 --> 00:41:41.041
Eternity?
Together with you. Roy?

631
00:41:41.124 --> 00:41:42.834
No. no. no. no.

632
00:41:42.918 --> 00:41:46.380
That would be more like hell
for poor Millie. Don't you think?

633
00:41:46.463 --> 00:41:47.881
Yeah. it would. It would.

634
00:41:48.006 --> 00:41:50.759
What are you laughing at? What?

635
00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:52.969
I'm just breaking your noix.

636
00:41:53.053 --> 00:41:54.054
Breaking my what?

637
00:41:54.137 --> 00:41:55.972
Your. uh. this. only for boys.

638
00:41:56.598 --> 00:41:57.933
Breaking my nuts? Yes.

639
00:41:58.058 --> 00:42:00.102
You were breaking my
nuts? Uh-huh.

640
00:42:01.228 --> 00:42:02.688
Yes! That was a good one.

641
00:42:02.771 --> 00:42:03.897
Oh. you got me.

642
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.023
I got you. Yeah.

643
00:42:05.107 --> 00:42:07.067
You got me. too.
Man. she's funny.

644
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:09.152
Weird. but funny.

645
00:42:09.528 --> 00:42:11.446
I'll shut up now.
Message Roy-ceiphed.

646
00:42:12.698 --> 00:42:14.533
I mean received. Aw. shit.

647
00:42:15.534 --> 00:42:17.202
Ow!

648
00:42:47.858 --> 00:42:50.277
I heard this was all
you could muster.

649
00:42:51.153 --> 00:42:53.447
Zeke: Word's getting around
about our kidnappings.

650
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:55.949
so it's rare to find anybody
gathering around here at all.

651
00:42:57.409 --> 00:43:00.036
Our last two scores
had to be over the border.

652
00:43:00.746 --> 00:43:03.915
Like I said.
we're done here now.

653
00:43:11.047 --> 00:43:14.176
You really don't wanna stay
and be a part of the foundation

654
00:43:14.259 --> 00:43:16.136
that creates a new world order?

655
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:21.183
You don't wanna witness
something truly biblical?

656
00:43:32.277 --> 00:43:35.113
What a shame
you have no faith in me.

657
00:43:35.864 --> 00:43:38.992
Because when I lead our kind
in earth's great takeover.

658
00:43:39.075 --> 00:43:43.038
you could have had
a seat at the main table.

659
00:43:59.054 --> 00:44:00.388
Look at me!

660
00:44:00.472 --> 00:44:02.015
Open your eyes.

661
00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:05.477
I said. open your eyes!

662
00:44:10.232 --> 00:44:11.817
And believe!

663
00:44:25.121 --> 00:44:27.332
How do you feel about staying?

664
00:44:30.627 --> 00:44:31.837
Go help the others.

665
00:44:33.713 --> 00:44:37.175
I want these new ones
masked up. watered and fed.

666
00:44:37.634 --> 00:44:39.803
I need them all fit
for the work ahead.

667
00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.491
You think anyone
doubts who I am now?

668
00:45:08.164 --> 00:45:11.418
Let's play a game called
"when we were alive."

669
00:45:12.252 --> 00:45:15.630
So. when you were alive.
what'd you prefer?

670
00:45:15.714 --> 00:45:18.383
Whiskey or gin?

671
00:45:18.466 --> 00:45:20.385
Dresses or tights?

672
00:45:20.468 --> 00:45:22.137
Chicken or steak?

673
00:45:23.346 --> 00:45:24.347
You know what to do.

674
00:45:25.056 --> 00:45:26.057
Come again?

675
00:45:33.273 --> 00:45:35.567
It's actually starting
to tickle.

676
00:45:35.692 --> 00:45:36.693
Damn it!

677
00:45:37.652 --> 00:45:39.905
The waltz or tango?

678
00:45:41.531 --> 00:45:43.533
Coffee or tea?

679
00:45:43.617 --> 00:45:45.577
Saloons or brothels?

680
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:48.997
Sunrise or sunset?

681
00:45:50.081 --> 00:45:52.417
Long hair. short hair?

682
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.544
Missionary or doggy-style?

683
00:45:54.628 --> 00:45:56.421
Oh! Ah!

684
00:45:56.588 --> 00:45:58.173
I'm starting to like that.

685
00:45:59.174 --> 00:46:00.342
Are we there yet?

686
00:46:03.887 --> 00:46:05.972
Jeanne: "The sun
will turn into darkness.

687
00:46:06.056 --> 00:46:07.265
"and the moon into blood.

688
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:09.351
"before the great
and terrible day comes."

689
00:46:09.434 --> 00:46:11.478
Roy: Guessing that's not
Marcus aurelius?

690
00:46:11.561 --> 00:46:12.771
Jeanne: The book ofjoel.

691
00:46:12.854 --> 00:46:15.565
The sentiment is echoed in
acts and revelations. signifying...

692
00:46:15.649 --> 00:46:16.959
The beginning
of the end of times?

693
00:46:16.983 --> 00:46:19.903
Yeah. hano sent me back to
earth with that same cheery note.

694
00:46:19.986 --> 00:46:21.947
Just over that Ridge
is red creek.

695
00:46:22.822 --> 00:46:24.658
I'd turn back if I were you.

696
00:46:26.451 --> 00:46:27.869
Here are the rules.

697
00:46:27.953 --> 00:46:31.831
You open that rancid piehole of yours
and you tell anyone who we really are.

698
00:46:31.915 --> 00:46:33.959
mmm-hmm. You eat
one of these bullets.

699
00:46:34.042 --> 00:46:37.253
You even imply
that we're ripd...

700
00:46:37.337 --> 00:46:38.838
You eat one of these
here bullets.

701
00:46:38.964 --> 00:46:45.095
In fact you speak without me
allowing you to speak...

702
00:46:45.178 --> 00:46:46.805
I eat one of them there bullets?

703
00:46:46.888 --> 00:46:49.015
You're not as dumb as you look.

704
00:46:56.356 --> 00:46:58.817
You so damn ugly.

705
00:47:00.276 --> 00:47:01.277
Good idea.

706
00:47:01.361 --> 00:47:03.488
We don't want anyone
recognizing we have him.

707
00:47:03.571 --> 00:47:05.991
Yeah. That's why I did it.

708
00:47:07.951 --> 00:47:09.619
Slim: What's that smell?

709
00:47:25.844 --> 00:47:28.763
Two black women are pulling
a hooded man through town

710
00:47:28.847 --> 00:47:30.724
with a rope and no one
bats an eyelid?

711
00:47:33.935 --> 00:47:36.855
They seem too ill
to notice anything.

712
00:47:36.938 --> 00:47:38.606
Yeah. I wonder
what's ailing them.

713
00:47:39.441 --> 00:47:41.651
Cholera hit Blackpool
a few months back.

714
00:47:49.784 --> 00:47:50.869
You hear that?

715
00:47:51.911 --> 00:47:54.164
Jeanne: I hear nothing. Exactly.

716
00:47:54.789 --> 00:47:58.168
Just when you think things
couldn't get any stranger...

717
00:48:00.378 --> 00:48:03.798
An empty saloon. Whatever
happened here. happened in a hurry.

718
00:48:06.718 --> 00:48:08.845
Boys. where is everyone?

719
00:48:12.766 --> 00:48:14.726
That's right! Pile it all up.

720
00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:17.228
Come on. keep it moving now.
Come on. There you go.

721
00:48:17.312 --> 00:48:20.148
All your donations are
going to a damn fine cause.

722
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.399
I assure you. so...

723
00:48:21.483 --> 00:48:23.818
Keep those heads up and
have another blessed Eve...

724
00:48:23.943 --> 00:48:26.823
Who's the snake oil salesman? Julius:
In the good lord's favorite town!

725
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.200
Slim: Ah. Julius butterfield.
He owns the saloon.

726
00:48:30.283 --> 00:48:33.828
livery stables. general store. the
local printing press and the hotel.

727
00:48:34.079 --> 00:48:35.914
Oh. yeah. He's also the mayor.

728
00:48:35.997 --> 00:48:37.248
Seems like a fair election.

729
00:48:42.879 --> 00:48:45.507
- Julius: Okay. I got you.
- I got you.

730
00:48:46.424 --> 00:48:48.051
Forgive my tardiness.

731
00:48:48.134 --> 00:48:51.221
There are days I need at least
five of me to get all I need...

732
00:48:52.388 --> 00:48:53.389
._done.

733
00:48:56.142 --> 00:48:57.393
Oh. no. no. no.

734
00:48:57.477 --> 00:48:58.520
You...

735
00:48:58.728 --> 00:49:00.897
You're gonna have to leave.
You should not be in here.

736
00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.482
Sure. we should!

737
00:49:03.525 --> 00:49:05.110
We're bounty hunters.

738
00:49:05.235 --> 00:49:08.696
Sisters. All the way
from bandera. Texas.

739
00:49:09.364 --> 00:49:12.617
We require lodgings.
And this is a hotel.

740
00:49:13.785 --> 00:49:14.786
He your bounty then?

741
00:49:16.329 --> 00:49:17.872
You're not as dumb as you look.

742
00:49:19.165 --> 00:49:20.458
Well. maybe you both are...

743
00:49:21.209 --> 00:49:23.044
Because it appears
that you can't read.

744
00:49:26.756 --> 00:49:27.924
Now leave.

745
00:49:28.591 --> 00:49:29.926
You're breaking the law.

746
00:49:30.635 --> 00:49:32.846
Just 'cause it's a law.
don't make it right.

747
00:49:33.429 --> 00:49:35.014
I'm gonna ask you
to take that down.

748
00:49:36.891 --> 00:49:38.643
Just as soon
as I get that chance.

749
00:49:48.653 --> 00:49:49.654
Burn it.

750
00:49:50.697 --> 00:49:52.490
You don't tell me what to do.

751
00:49:55.952 --> 00:49:56.953
Now.

752
00:49:59.164 --> 00:50:00.165
Right.

753
00:50:01.708 --> 00:50:02.709
You're right.

754
00:50:03.668 --> 00:50:05.712
Capitalism is colorblind.

755
00:50:05.795 --> 00:50:08.298
And being more open means
making more money. after all.

756
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:10.550
Thank you.

757
00:50:12.468 --> 00:50:13.469
All right.

758
00:50:32.739 --> 00:50:33.823
You all right?

759
00:50:45.251 --> 00:50:46.252
Bevedy!

760
00:50:50.215 --> 00:50:51.216
Yes. sir!

761
00:50:52.967 --> 00:50:55.011
What's all that "sir" nonsense?

762
00:50:55.345 --> 00:50:58.973
I told you it's just plain old
"Julius" to you and everyone else.

763
00:50:59.057 --> 00:51:01.184
We're all one and the same
around here.

764
00:51:02.894 --> 00:51:05.563
Now. Beverly would you
please be so kind

765
00:51:05.647 --> 00:51:09.400
as to show our guests here
to room 5?

766
00:51:12.862 --> 00:51:13.988
Thank you.

767
00:51:15.323 --> 00:51:16.574
Enjoy your stay.

768
00:51:19.452 --> 00:51:20.787
Follow me. ladies.

769
00:51:26.209 --> 00:51:30.672
Pardon my asking. but I recognize
the birthmark on the arm of your bounty.

770
00:51:30.755 --> 00:51:33.841
He and his posse have been in
and out of town a few times of late.

771
00:51:33.925 --> 00:51:35.718
Mind if I enquire
what you got him for?

772
00:51:35.802 --> 00:51:37.345
Killing a us marshal.

773
00:51:37.428 --> 00:51:40.181
Slim: I told you. I
ain't kill no...

774
00:51:40.265 --> 00:51:41.933
But don't you worry none.
miss Beverly.

775
00:51:42.016 --> 00:51:43.851
We're gonna keep a
real close eye on him.

776
00:51:43.935 --> 00:51:45.561
I ain't afraid of him.

777
00:51:45.645 --> 00:51:49.983
His partners were plain nasty.
But he was. uh. nice.

778
00:51:50.066 --> 00:51:51.234
Slim: Yes. thank you.

779
00:51:51.317 --> 00:51:52.485
Come on in.

780
00:51:57.407 --> 00:51:59.617
I hope it has everything
you need.

781
00:52:02.161 --> 00:52:05.707
Jeanne: Excuse my own
inquisitiveness.

782
00:52:06.708 --> 00:52:08.251
miss Beverly.

783
00:52:08.334 --> 00:52:12.088
but what ails the town?

784
00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:17.885
No one knows for sure.

785
00:52:18.678 --> 00:52:20.096
Started about a month ago.

786
00:52:20.722 --> 00:52:23.766
Mr. Butterfield says it has
to do with the water supply.

787
00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:26.519
But between you and me
and the bedpost.

788
00:52:26.602 --> 00:52:29.897
I think that's just a ploy
for him to sell more whiskey.

789
00:52:30.315 --> 00:52:31.607
To who?

790
00:52:31.691 --> 00:52:33.318
There ain't barely
anyone around.

791
00:52:33.526 --> 00:52:36.612
Oh. Town emptied out
dead of last night.

792
00:52:37.488 --> 00:52:40.658
Mr. Butterfield says gold
was struck not far away.

793
00:52:41.284 --> 00:52:44.996
Seems everyone must want a
piece before there's nothing left.

794
00:52:46.331 --> 00:52:49.143
If that was the case. I reckon old
butterfield would have been the first

795
00:52:49.167 --> 00:52:50.418
to break ground.

796
00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:52.879
Do you really believe him?

797
00:52:54.797 --> 00:52:56.174
I don't have much of a choice.

798
00:52:57.175 --> 00:52:58.176
Pardon me.

799
00:53:02.138 --> 00:53:03.538
I suggest you keep
your door locked.

800
00:53:07.268 --> 00:53:09.395
Slim: You heard her.
She said I'm nice.

801
00:53:09.479 --> 00:53:10.938
She ain't well.

802
00:53:11.022 --> 00:53:12.774
Confusing you with someone else.

803
00:53:12.857 --> 00:53:15.151
I mean. can a deado be nice?

804
00:53:15.234 --> 00:53:17.195
Not in my extended expenence.

805
00:53:17.278 --> 00:53:19.739
Slim: Well. look who's
discriminating now.

806
00:53:19.822 --> 00:53:22.992
There must be something in
the air making everybody sick.

807
00:53:23.076 --> 00:53:26.371
That's why it's not affecting any
of us. In other words. the dead.

808
00:53:26.454 --> 00:53:28.081
And I think...

809
00:53:30.583 --> 00:53:32.043
It's coming from up there.

810
00:53:32.126 --> 00:53:33.294
Slim: Hmm? Up where?

811
00:53:42.804 --> 00:53:44.555
Girl: Daddy! Daddy!

812
00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:51.229
Stay with me! Stay with me!

813
00:53:53.481 --> 00:53:55.233
Don't. don't! Don't. don't!

814
00:53:55.316 --> 00:53:57.527
Please! I've got
to revive my daddy.

815
00:53:57.610 --> 00:53:59.529
Please... no. no. no.

816
00:54:00.655 --> 00:54:03.866
Look. he's still with us.
Just let him rest.

817
00:54:04.909 --> 00:54:08.287
Listen. lady. Up here. if you
take off that mask. you will die.

818
00:54:08.371 --> 00:54:09.539
And fast.

819
00:54:09.622 --> 00:54:11.040
How do you know?

820
00:54:12.792 --> 00:54:13.918
I've seen it happen.

821
00:54:31.477 --> 00:54:34.897
Girl: Okay! Stop it!
You've made your point.

822
00:54:36.399 --> 00:54:37.525
Okay!

823
00:54:49.745 --> 00:54:51.330
What do they want with us all?

824
00:54:51.831 --> 00:54:52.832
I don't know.

825
00:54:53.583 --> 00:54:56.002
I have a feeling that we'll
come to understand real soon.

826
00:54:56.586 --> 00:54:58.296
Man: What are you looking at?

827
00:55:36.751 --> 00:55:37.877
God damn it!

828
00:55:42.757 --> 00:55:45.301
Otis: You gotta get all the
equipment up to the mine.

829
00:55:46.177 --> 00:55:47.720
There's no time to waste.

830
00:55:47.803 --> 00:55:50.723
We start opening the gateway
in less than an hour.

831
00:55:57.647 --> 00:55:59.148
What do you want. butterfield?

832
00:55:59.232 --> 00:56:01.234
Listen. Otis.

833
00:56:01.317 --> 00:56:03.736
I've done everything
asked of me so far. haventl?

834
00:56:04.403 --> 00:56:07.657
You did try and run away from
me a few days ago. remember?

835
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.451
Okay. okay. but since then.

836
00:56:10.535 --> 00:56:13.037
I couldn't have been more
accommodating to your needs.

837
00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.249
no matter how felonious
or demanding.

838
00:56:18.042 --> 00:56:19.043
But. please.

839
00:56:19.377 --> 00:56:20.795
I'm begging you.

840
00:56:21.128 --> 00:56:24.173
All I want in return
is one of these.

841
00:56:28.344 --> 00:56:30.221
I told you they're
for workers only.

842
00:56:31.639 --> 00:56:33.474
Are you gonna be one?

843
00:56:33.558 --> 00:56:35.726
I told you. I got a town to run.

844
00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:37.395
You don't have much of one left.

845
00:56:37.478 --> 00:56:38.980
Because you've taken everyone!

846
00:56:39.063 --> 00:56:40.439
No! Please!

847
00:56:44.944 --> 00:56:46.362
No. no. no. Please.

848
00:56:48.155 --> 00:56:50.425
Please! A couple of healthy
ones just checked into the hotel.

849
00:56:50.449 --> 00:56:51.951
Take them. too.

850
00:56:52.034 --> 00:56:54.245
Just give me a mask.

851
00:56:55.329 --> 00:56:56.831
I don't wanna die.

852
00:56:56.914 --> 00:56:59.417
Death is not so bad.

853
00:57:01.294 --> 00:57:06.007
In fact. sometimes it's the
beginning of a whole new kind of life.

854
00:57:06.716 --> 00:57:08.092
I mean. look at us.

855
00:57:08.175 --> 00:57:13.347
we can breathe all kinds of toxic
air that you can't in your current form.

856
00:57:20.521 --> 00:57:23.983
And didn't I promise your body
the same sort of rebirth

857
00:57:24.066 --> 00:57:28.404
if you just showed us a little
cooperation and hospitality?

858
00:57:28.487 --> 00:57:29.655
And I have.

859
00:57:30.573 --> 00:57:31.907
I've done everything.

860
00:57:31.991 --> 00:57:34.910
I just... I just want
my town back.

861
00:57:36.662 --> 00:57:39.540
Tomorrow is the dawn
of a new day for you.

862
00:57:42.126 --> 00:57:44.462
And all mankind.

863
00:57:45.921 --> 00:57:47.006
Go on.

864
00:57:47.298 --> 00:57:48.299
Take it.

865
00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:51.260
It's yours.

866
00:58:05.775 --> 00:58:08.152
What are you all even doing
up that mountain anyways?

867
00:58:08.736 --> 00:58:12.782
Well now that you have that
mask on. you're gonna find out.

868
00:58:16.243 --> 00:58:17.828
Julius: Otis. please!

869
00:58:18.788 --> 00:58:19.872
Otis!

870
00:58:20.581 --> 00:58:21.916
Otis! Man: Get back.

871
00:58:24.627 --> 00:58:27.922
Ugh. Damn! Smelt like a
horse's ding-dong under there

872
00:58:28.005 --> 00:58:29.085
you would know. Where is...

873
00:58:29.131 --> 00:58:31.425
Otis keeping the kidnappees?

874
00:58:31.509 --> 00:58:33.928
We delivered them to the
church. That's all I know. Promise.

875
00:58:35.888 --> 00:58:38.015
Ow. What are you doing?
I can help!

876
00:58:38.099 --> 00:58:40.226
Nice try hoss.
You're staying put.

877
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:42.395
You got looser lips
than a jawless mule.

878
00:58:42.478 --> 00:58:44.188
You're gonna stay right here.

879
00:58:44.271 --> 00:58:45.356
Come on!

880
00:58:45.439 --> 00:58:48.651
That is tight as a bull's ass
in fly season.

881
00:58:48.734 --> 00:58:51.570
Look. give me a chance
to prove myself!

882
00:58:51.654 --> 00:58:53.739
Please. I don't wanna
go to hell.

883
00:58:53.823 --> 00:58:55.825
Nothing we can do
about that now.

884
00:58:56.575 --> 00:58:58.869
I didn't do nothing that bad
when I was alive.

885
00:58:58.953 --> 00:59:00.413
Clearly. you did enough.

886
00:59:00.496 --> 00:59:03.416
I mean. I stole some stuff.

887
00:59:03.499 --> 00:59:04.583
Just some?

888
00:59:04.667 --> 00:59:06.544
Okay. a little more than some.

889
00:59:08.337 --> 00:59:10.172
A lot. I stole a lot of stuff.

890
00:59:10.256 --> 00:59:11.716
In fact. I was called "bumble."

891
00:59:11.799 --> 00:59:14.510
on account of my hands were
stickier than a beehive. See?

892
00:59:15.761 --> 00:59:17.805
Hey! That's my new susie!

893
00:59:20.224 --> 00:59:22.101
You call your gun "susie"?

894
00:59:22.810 --> 00:59:25.062
Yeah. named it after
my dear old meemaw.

895
00:59:25.146 --> 00:59:28.190
You named a soul killer after your
grandma and I'm the twisted one?

896
00:59:28.274 --> 00:59:31.110
You should be going to hell.
not... my point is.

897
00:59:31.193 --> 00:59:33.904
I could have blown both
your souls to dustjust now.

898
00:59:33.988 --> 00:59:35.156
But I didn't.

899
00:59:36.198 --> 00:59:38.951
'Cause I want you to know
you can trust me.

900
00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:42.371
Stealing ain't right.
I know that.

901
00:59:42.913 --> 00:59:44.623
But it ain't nothing
compared to them souls

902
00:59:44.707 --> 00:59:46.584
that took over
the other Samuel boys.

903
00:59:46.667 --> 00:59:50.296
You heard Beverly. them deados
are meaner than out snakes.

904
00:59:50.379 --> 00:59:51.797
And I ain't like them.

905
00:59:52.256 --> 00:59:56.844
You think it's fair that we all getjudged
to end up in the same awful place?

906
01:00:03.851 --> 01:00:05.478
Psst. psst.

907
01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:07.605
What is it?

908
01:00:07.688 --> 01:00:10.274
Is there a chance that
old slim. the real slim.

909
01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:12.485
a little part of him
is still in there?

910
01:00:12.568 --> 01:00:15.070
No. Slim is long gone.

911
01:00:15.154 --> 01:00:17.698
This "bumble" soul
is in complete control now.

912
01:00:17.782 --> 01:00:19.575
And he's playing you. Roy.

913
01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.953
Deados will do anything
to avoid going to hell.

914
01:00:23.746 --> 01:00:24.997
Don't be fooled.

915
01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:26.957
Now let's go.

916
01:00:30.586 --> 01:00:33.047
Slim: I don't wanna go
to hell. I don't belong there!

917
01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.217
Please! Let me prove it to
you. I can prove it to you. please.

918
01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.761
I said. let's go. Roy.
Slim: Please!

919
01:00:40.095 --> 01:00:43.307
Please! Please come back!

920
01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.893
I don't wanna go to hell!

921
01:00:47.353 --> 01:00:49.980
Please! I don't belong there!

922
01:00:59.824 --> 01:01:02.660
Jeanne:
God have mercy on their souls.

923
01:01:05.246 --> 01:01:06.247
Sorry.

924
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:09.917
The desecration of a house
of god is the ultimate sin.

925
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.168
Ultimate?

926
01:01:11.252 --> 01:01:15.756
Kidnapping. hurting children. murder.
tad bit higher. but to each their own.

927
01:01:17.716 --> 01:01:19.969
At least we know
slim was telling the truth.

928
01:01:20.052 --> 01:01:22.930
Angus was here. He was wearing
this the day he was taken.

929
01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:25.558
Man: Help me somebody!

930
01:01:25.933 --> 01:01:28.811
Help me. please! Anybody!

931
01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:32.273
Is anybody there? Please!
Anybody. help...

932
01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:34.358
Butterfield?

933
01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:39.530
What the hell
are you doing in there?

934
01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:41.574
This guy Otis
and his bunch of madmen!

935
01:01:41.657 --> 01:01:43.117
They've seized my entire town.

936
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.470
just rode right in here. threw
me in the back of this Van...

937
01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:47.413
Slow down! Where'd
they take everyone?

938
01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.039
Up the mountain.

939
01:01:49.874 --> 01:01:51.792
But the only thing up
there is an old mine.

940
01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:53.887
Ain't no one struck it lucky
up there for...

941
01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:55.087
Yeah. The gateway!

942
01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.632
I did hear Otis say something
about "opening a gateway."

943
01:01:58.716 --> 01:02:01.927
The poisonous gas in the air
is seeping through the gateway

944
01:02:02.011 --> 01:02:03.762
from the depths of hell.

945
01:02:03.846 --> 01:02:06.557
That rupture
was Otis's soul escaping.

946
01:02:08.517 --> 01:02:10.603
Oh. lord. Why are you praying?

947
01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:15.608
Otis is going to use the humans
to crack the whole thing wide open.

948
01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:17.735
Why. so he can
get back inside? No.

949
01:02:17.818 --> 01:02:20.321
So he can let the souls
of the damned back out.

950
01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:22.448
Roy. Roy?

951
01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:25.993
Jeanne: Otis is going to use those
digging humans and turn them into deados.

952
01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.829
After that.
they'll keep pouring out.

953
01:02:28.913 --> 01:02:31.123
eventually taking over and...

954
01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:33.334
Possessing the rest
of the world.

955
01:02:33.876 --> 01:02:35.920
I get it. End of times.

956
01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:37.838
Mmm-hmm.

957
01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:41.383
But why doesn't Otis and his deado
troop just do the digging themselves?

958
01:02:41.467 --> 01:02:44.595
Like us. they're unaffected by the gas
and stronger than the humans. right?

959
01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:50.184
God created a defense. a kind
of buffer between earth and hell

960
01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.353
to stop the souls beneath
from returning.

961
01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:55.439
That buffer was all of humanity.

962
01:02:55.940 --> 01:03:00.402
Only when they invite the souls
back in are they able to rise again.

963
01:03:00.486 --> 01:03:01.766
Roy: But that
would never happen.

964
01:03:01.862 --> 01:03:05.282
'Cause mankind would never
welcome pure evil back into their world.

965
01:03:05.366 --> 01:03:07.493
But by digging
through the gateway.

966
01:03:08.661 --> 01:03:10.287
that's exactly
what they're doing.

967
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:22.841
Okay. you just lost me with all
that talk of hell and "souls escaping."

968
01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:26.512
You women can be
so overly dramatic.

969
01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:29.974
Really? Well. clearly
you don't want "us women"...

970
01:03:30.057 --> 01:03:31.725
To save your ass?

971
01:03:32.601 --> 01:03:34.311
No!

972
01:03:34.395 --> 01:03:35.437
Fine. just do it yourself!

973
01:03:46.532 --> 01:03:47.533
A little help!

974
01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:56.875
Roy: A little help!

975
01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:00.713
A little more help! I'm trying.

976
01:04:03.799 --> 01:04:04.925
Here! Take it.

977
01:04:35.706 --> 01:04:37.207
Mr. Butterfield!

978
01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:40.502
I have your tea
and nightcap for you.

979
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:44.882
Mr. Butterfield. sir?

980
01:05:37.017 --> 01:05:39.311
"Butterfield printing press"?

981
01:05:39.812 --> 01:05:41.063
"500 copies"?

982
01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:08.215
You didn't kill no lawman.

983
01:06:09.216 --> 01:06:11.468
You're a victim
of a gross injustice.

984
01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:16.640
No way.

985
01:06:17.766 --> 01:06:18.767
Now go.

986
01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.727
Before they come back.

987
01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:44.626
I think I'm dying.

988
01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.006
I know something that may help.

989
01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.726
Get these to the folks
who are still around.

990
01:07:00.809 --> 01:07:02.186
Can you help me?

991
01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:04.688
I've got some place else
I need to be.

992
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.187
Nell: You guys ready?
Cooper: Yeah. All set. ma'am.

993
01:07:27.211 --> 01:07:28.337
It's almost midnight.

994
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.425
Not much longer now.

995
01:07:35.302 --> 01:07:36.511
Hey. hey!

996
01:07:36.595 --> 01:07:37.846
Back from the door!

997
01:07:41.475 --> 01:07:42.476
Hey.

998
01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:45.103
I know that sword.

999
01:07:46.063 --> 01:07:49.149
Yeah. We bagged
ourselves some ripd.

1000
01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:07.376
Don't take your eyes off them.

1001
01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:12.506
It looked like she recognized
you and could see me.

1002
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:17.177
Yup. Now we know where those
deados got their ripd weapons.

1003
01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.012
That's Nell boyce.

1004
01:08:19.096 --> 01:08:21.473
Recruitment got
that one all wrong.

1005
01:08:21.556 --> 01:08:23.850
She robbed our armory
before going into hiding.

1006
01:08:23.934 --> 01:08:25.774
Guess she found something
worth coming out for.

1007
01:09:03.849 --> 01:09:06.018
Roy: You got some stones
on you. boy.

1008
01:09:06.101 --> 01:09:09.396
But sometimes. saving
the day requires you to admit

1009
01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.023
you can't do it alone.

1010
01:09:11.732 --> 01:09:12.733
Angus: Whoa.

1011
01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:16.028
You should better
get some masks.

1012
01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:18.739
You're gonna croak real
fast up in here if you don't.

1013
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.283
Angus?

1014
01:09:22.159 --> 01:09:24.202
I'm sorry. do I know you. ma'am?

1015
01:09:24.286 --> 01:09:25.704
Of course you do. son.
It's me...

1016
01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:27.414
Ro...

1017
01:09:28.457 --> 01:09:29.458
Right.

1018
01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:32.669
No. uh...

1019
01:09:33.879 --> 01:09:35.881
No. you. uh. don't know me.

1020
01:09:35.964 --> 01:09:37.257
No. um...

1021
01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:39.885
I. uh. just heard...

1022
01:09:39.968 --> 01:09:42.387
Your name called out by somebody

1023
01:09:42.471 --> 01:09:45.265
when you were storming
out of the cage

1024
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:47.351
like a wild mustang.

1025
01:09:47.434 --> 01:09:49.102
"Careful. Angus!

1026
01:09:49.186 --> 01:09:51.813
"Don't do anything foolish.
Angus. And so on."

1027
01:09:51.897 --> 01:09:53.940
That doesn't matter right
now. What matters is...

1028
01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.610
I see you now.

1029
01:09:56.693 --> 01:10:00.155
And you got much more moxie
than I ever gave you credit for.

1030
01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:06.161
I've been wrong to judge you
unkindly since we met.

1031
01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:10.332
Which was. what.
maybe a minute ago?

1032
01:10:10.832 --> 01:10:11.833
Miss...

1033
01:10:12.292 --> 01:10:13.460
Mabel.

1034
01:10:14.169 --> 01:10:15.504
The name's Mabel.

1035
01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.173
Are you married. Angus?

1036
01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.217
Angus: No. ma'am.

1037
01:10:21.468 --> 01:10:22.469
But I'm engaged.

1038
01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:25.972
To the most wondrous human
that I've ever met.

1039
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:27.516
And her father?

1040
01:10:27.599 --> 01:10:29.267
Handsome son of a bitch.
ain't he?

1041
01:10:29.351 --> 01:10:31.686
What? I mean... I guess?

1042
01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:33.397
Not a guessing game.
I'm sure he is.

1043
01:10:35.399 --> 01:10:39.152
You know. I just never understood
why he never took a shine to me.

1044
01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:45.283
Maybe he stupidly thought that
you marrying my... his daughter...

1045
01:10:45.367 --> 01:10:47.285
You were trying to replace him.

1046
01:10:47.953 --> 01:10:48.954
And you know...

1047
01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:54.418
What. with his poor wife taken
ill by the pox a few years earlier...

1048
01:10:55.961 --> 01:11:00.715
Maybe he was scared
he'd be left all alone.

1049
01:11:01.049 --> 01:11:02.050
Wow.

1050
01:11:03.635 --> 01:11:06.680
How could you possibly
know all that?

1051
01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:09.307
It's a gift.

1052
01:11:10.976 --> 01:11:13.478
Some call it women's intuition.

1053
01:11:13.562 --> 01:11:15.230
Let me ask you something.

1054
01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:19.484
If he was standing right here. right
now. what would you say to him?

1055
01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:23.447
Well. I would say. "Roy..."

1056
01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:24.781
"You handsome son-of-a-bitch."

1057
01:11:24.865 --> 01:11:27.075
start with flattery.
helps with future in-laws.

1058
01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:29.744
Angus: Um... so I'd say. "Roy...

1059
01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:35.208
"Not only do I think
that you are...

1060
01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:39.504
A handsome son-of-a-bitch." Angus:
A handsome son-of-a-bitch. but...

1061
01:11:39.588 --> 01:11:43.508
"I just want you to know that I
could never compete with you.

1062
01:11:43.592 --> 01:11:46.887
"And I just hope you know
how much I respect you.

1063
01:11:48.847 --> 01:11:51.475
"If I can ever be half the
husband for my Charlotte

1064
01:11:51.558 --> 01:11:53.643
"that you've been
a father. then I...

1065
01:11:53.727 --> 01:11:56.146
"I'll die knowing
that I got it right."

1066
01:11:59.608 --> 01:12:02.402
You're gonna get that chance.
I promise you.

1067
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:07.991
For inspiration.

1068
01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:13.330
I told you. I got a gift.

1069
01:12:13.413 --> 01:12:15.624
Otherworldly. you might say.

1070
01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:27.969
Here we go.

1071
01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:42.651
It's time.

1072
01:12:43.652 --> 01:12:45.987
Gateway is weaker
than I thought.

1073
01:12:47.906 --> 01:12:50.325
They'll break through
sooner than expected.

1074
01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:52.035
Bring 'em all in.

1075
01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:55.455
What do you want to do
about the ripd?

1076
01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.126
Otis: I got plans for them.

1077
01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:14.808
Mabel! Mabel!

1078
01:13:15.475 --> 01:13:16.560
Help!

1079
01:13:17.769 --> 01:13:20.939
You stay down. You stay
calm. Think of Charlotte!

1080
01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:24.818
Let me go with him.

1081
01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:25.902
Let me go with him!

1082
01:13:25.986 --> 01:13:27.487
We wanna go in! We wanna help!

1083
01:13:27.571 --> 01:13:28.572
Nell: I bet you do.

1084
01:13:30.198 --> 01:13:31.783
Ripd scum.

1085
01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:34.536
Hey. Joan. been a long time.

1086
01:13:35.537 --> 01:13:37.664
Still got this famous
blade of yours.

1087
01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:43.044
As ex-ripd. I can tell you
what these two really look like.

1088
01:13:45.422 --> 01:13:47.215
I can see them.

1089
01:13:50.427 --> 01:13:52.887
I can see everything.

1090
01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:56.016
And I can tell you
it's too late for you

1091
01:13:56.099 --> 01:13:58.101
and your department. I'm afraid.

1092
01:13:58.977 --> 01:14:03.064
Tomorrow your ripd will be
useless against our numbers.

1093
01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:08.320
When the gateway opens wide.
deados will take over.

1094
01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:11.823
And I'm gonna rule over
them all as I turn earth

1095
01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:15.910
into the tenth circle of hell.

1096
01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:19.247
Ah!

1097
01:14:19.748 --> 01:14:21.708
Just before dawn.
bring them in so that

1098
01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:23.376
I can throw them into the abyss

1099
01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.129
before the gateway
closes once again.

1100
01:14:34.596 --> 01:14:37.682
And for someone who
hates fire as much as you.

1101
01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:39.768
Jeanne d'Arc.

1102
01:14:40.435 --> 01:14:42.812
you'll be bathing in it
for all eternity.

1103
01:14:45.357 --> 01:14:46.858
Nell: Whoa-ho.

1104
01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:52.697
The irony
is so gloriously delicious.

1105
01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.911
Do not let them
out of your sight.

1106
01:15:07.796 --> 01:15:10.382
Jeanne d'Arc? Joan?

1107
01:15:10.465 --> 01:15:12.676
445 years dead?

1108
01:15:12.759 --> 01:15:15.095
I think pretty quick on
my feet. I figured it out.

1109
01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.097
You're... Joan ofarc.

1110
01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.348
Wow.

1111
01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:20.016
Joan.

1112
01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:23.561
If it's all right with you. I'm just
gonna keep calling you Jean.

1113
01:15:23.645 --> 01:15:26.106
Jeanne. Jean. Jeanne. samethmg.

1114
01:15:27.065 --> 01:15:30.860
Joan ofarc. first partner this
lone wolf has ever really needed.

1115
01:15:32.112 --> 01:15:35.156
And I've enjoyed having you
as my fourth partner.

1116
01:15:36.658 --> 01:15:37.659
Roycephus.

1117
01:15:37.742 --> 01:15:40.954
Well. let's hope those
other three are really with us.

1118
01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:42.997
'cause we're gonna need
all the help we can muster

1119
01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:44.165
to get the hell out of here.

1120
01:15:51.506 --> 01:15:53.174
Nell: Harder. Dig harder.

1121
01:15:57.804 --> 01:15:58.847
Get him up.

1122
01:15:58.972 --> 01:16:01.725
Deado: Get up. Angus:
No. no. no. Please. I can help.

1123
01:16:01.808 --> 01:16:03.810
Come on. Deado: Back to work!

1124
01:16:24.998 --> 01:16:27.292
I can feel it now.

1125
01:16:30.628 --> 01:16:32.422
In three...

1126
01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:34.132
Two...

1127
01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:36.968
One.

1128
01:17:38.071 --> 01:17:41.115
Roy: So if they can get
this gateway open.

1129
01:17:41.199 --> 01:17:43.493
is there anything
that can close it?

1130
01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:47.539
Yes. Butwe'll need
to extinguish the hellfire.

1131
01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:50.250
Only one thing can do that.

1132
01:17:50.917 --> 01:17:53.711
During the siege of Orleans.
when I was alive.

1133
01:17:54.712 --> 01:17:58.049
I broke ranks to assess the
damage done to our houses of god...

1134
01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.885
God. have mercy on their souls.

1135
01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:06.599
I discovered something
truly magnificent.

1136
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:12.230
The tears of Christ.

1137
01:18:13.106 --> 01:18:16.025
Slim: Hey. y'all. Room
for one more at this party?

1138
01:18:16.109 --> 01:18:19.028
Well. well. well. Look
what the cat dragged in.

1139
01:18:19.112 --> 01:18:20.530
Didn't think we'd see you again.

1140
01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:22.657
Shut up. Cooper.
You talk too much.

1141
01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:27.662
Mm. How does it feel being
on the "royceiphing" end?

1142
01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.665
Oh. that's hers. ain't it?

1143
01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:32.876
Yeah.

1144
01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.086
It's big.

1145
01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:39.257
Cooper: Whoa. Take it easy.

1146
01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.175
Not after the way
she's treated me.

1147
01:18:41.259 --> 01:18:42.886
This is not
what's planned for her.

1148
01:18:42.969 --> 01:18:44.679
You don't wanna
go against orders.

1149
01:18:46.931 --> 01:18:48.308
Well. how about her. then?

1150
01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:50.476
Ireahyfeelhke shooting somebody.

1151
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:52.020
I get that.

1152
01:18:52.812 --> 01:18:54.147
Oh. you do?

1153
01:18:54.564 --> 01:18:55.815
Well. that's great!

1154
01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.844
Well. do you trust me now?

1155
01:19:27.013 --> 01:19:28.264
So before I let you out.

1156
01:19:28.348 --> 01:19:31.267
I want you to promise me.
my soul gets a retrial.

1157
01:19:31.351 --> 01:19:33.478
I want my current
judgement revoked.

1158
01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:37.023
That's rare. but not impossible.

1159
01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:39.776
You let us out.
and I'll see to it.

1160
01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:43.821
And you.

1161
01:19:45.615 --> 01:19:47.617
Before I let you out.
you need to see this.

1162
01:19:49.619 --> 01:19:51.704
Remember. butterfield
owns a printing press.

1163
01:19:51.788 --> 01:19:53.289
and like I said. I was framed.

1164
01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:55.458
I told you the bills
weren't official.

1165
01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:57.251
Butterfield had
them fake ones made.

1166
01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:00.421
Your beef is with him.
not me. roycephus.

1167
01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:03.591
Call me Roy.

1168
01:20:23.194 --> 01:20:25.475
All right. listen to me. We
gotta try and get out of here.

1169
01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:28.282
We gotta get out right now! No!

1170
01:20:28.366 --> 01:20:30.451
Daddy! No!

1171
01:20:32.203 --> 01:20:33.204
Please...

1172
01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.838
He's gone! He's been
taken! Look at me!

1173
01:20:41.921 --> 01:20:43.840
Your daddy's gone.
We have to go!

1174
01:20:49.262 --> 01:20:51.806
These tears need to be dropped
into the eye of the hellfire.

1175
01:20:51.889 --> 01:20:53.141
dead center in the gateway.

1176
01:20:53.224 --> 01:20:55.435
Only then will it seal.
sucking everything in with it.

1177
01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:57.158
Means we gotta get
those humans out first.

1178
01:20:57.603 --> 01:20:58.604
Exactly.

1179
01:20:59.564 --> 01:21:00.565
Now go.

1180
01:21:01.149 --> 01:21:02.483
Uh. you're coming with.

1181
01:21:02.567 --> 01:21:05.111
Ican't. Roy. I... I just can't.

1182
01:21:06.154 --> 01:21:07.321
Go! Go!

1183
01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:13.995
Just stay with me. You'll
get out. Just stay with me.

1184
01:21:25.006 --> 01:21:26.591
Come on! I think I get it!

1185
01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:30.595
Don't look at them!

1186
01:21:30.678 --> 01:21:32.680
Avert your eyes!

1187
01:21:32.764 --> 01:21:34.223
Avert your eyes!

1188
01:21:35.475 --> 01:21:38.495
You've got fire in you that's greater
than anything that ever came out of hell.

1189
01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:40.104
You got this. Come on. now!

1190
01:21:40.188 --> 01:21:42.356
Not a moment has passed
since I was burned at the stake

1191
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.567
that I have not heard
my own dying screams.

1192
01:21:46.652 --> 01:21:47.862
I can't do fire. Roy.

1193
01:21:48.738 --> 01:21:49.739
I'm sorry.

1194
01:21:50.156 --> 01:21:51.199
Bring me in.

1195
01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:55.578
Hey. partner.

1196
01:21:56.329 --> 01:22:00.083
You've been safeguarding
these for 445 years.

1197
01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:02.168
This is your moment.

1198
01:22:10.093 --> 01:22:12.720
Make them open their eyes!

1199
01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.643
Make them look!

1200
01:22:28.528 --> 01:22:29.904
I didn't call forthem.

1201
01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:31.614
No choice.
the other one rebelled.

1202
01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:33.699
Took out Cooper and Brooks
before I got her.

1203
01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:34.968
What should I do with this one?

1204
01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:36.119
Just throw him in!

1205
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:44.627
Ready? Mmnpmnm.

1206
01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:45.711
Set. Mmm-hmm.

1207
01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:03.437
Angus: This way. Come on.

1208
01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:04.897
Come on.

1209
01:23:09.944 --> 01:23:12.613
Go help Angus and the others.
I'm gonna find me this Otis.

1210
01:23:12.697 --> 01:23:13.698
Okay.

1211
01:23:14.282 --> 01:23:15.867
Close your eyes!
Close your eyes!

1212
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:16.990
Come on. come on. come on!

1213
01:23:17.034 --> 01:23:18.411
Keep your eyes closed! Go! Move!

1214
01:23:19.036 --> 01:23:20.037
Go! Go!

1215
01:23:20.538 --> 01:23:21.539
Watch out! No!

1216
01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:28.671
Let's go! Come on!

1217
01:23:41.809 --> 01:23:43.144
Whoa!

1218
01:24:06.834 --> 01:24:08.544
Roy: I get it. It's hot.

1219
01:24:08.836 --> 01:24:10.379
It's gonna get
a whole lot hotter.

1220
01:24:12.757 --> 01:24:13.966
Julius: Please. Please.

1221
01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.343
No. no. no. no_.

1222
01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.185
Get out of here. Go!

1223
01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:38.741
Slim: Keep your eyes closed!

1224
01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:39.825
Keep your eyes closed!

1225
01:24:39.951 --> 01:24:41.369
Come on! Go!

1226
01:24:41.494 --> 01:24:42.828
Go! Feeh

1227
01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.090
We need to hold on.

1228
01:26:02.408 --> 01:26:04.076
Hold on!

1229
01:26:25.097 --> 01:26:26.515
Angus: Hey. it's over.

1230
01:26:26.599 --> 01:26:27.641
It's over.

1231
01:26:31.604 --> 01:26:33.939
That's some powerful tears
you got there.

1232
01:26:34.899 --> 01:26:37.943
And the wretched
are where they belong.

1233
01:26:39.278 --> 01:26:41.072
Roy: And Otis. too.
from the looks of it.

1234
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:48.120
Thanks for showing up
when you did.

1235
01:26:48.204 --> 01:26:49.914
You didn't give me much choice.

1236
01:26:51.248 --> 01:26:53.709
Little help. please.

1237
01:26:56.462 --> 01:26:57.463
Come on.

1238
01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:03.636
Oh. it's really in there.

1239
01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:05.919
Jeanne: Yes. it's like the
earth is tightened around it.

1240
01:27:06.263 --> 01:27:10.393
Otis: Your interference
is really testing my Patience.

1241
01:27:28.786 --> 01:27:32.581
Appears I'll have to wait
another 25 years

1242
01:27:32.665 --> 01:27:34.083
for this opportunity.

1243
01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:35.501
Astaroth!

1244
01:27:35.876 --> 01:27:38.587
As... what? What's an astaroth?

1245
01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:41.924
Jeanne: One-third
of the evil Trinity.

1246
01:27:42.883 --> 01:27:44.969
The right hand
to the devil himself.

1247
01:27:45.261 --> 01:27:48.931
Until I Rose to establish
my own throne here on earth.

1248
01:27:49.014 --> 01:27:51.434
And you're not gonna
stop me this time!

1249
01:28:06.449 --> 01:28:07.950
Jeanne:
I've lost the tears. Roy.

1250
01:28:13.539 --> 01:28:14.999
I've got to get to my sword.

1251
01:28:18.127 --> 01:28:19.128
Roy: Hold on. now.

1252
01:28:20.171 --> 01:28:21.714
Look what got left behind.

1253
01:28:26.677 --> 01:28:28.220
Relax. I got this.

1254
01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:30.639
Hey. asshole-roth!

1255
01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:42.294
Nothing more humiliating
than having your soul taken

1256
01:29:42.378 --> 01:29:44.964
by your own weapon. huh?

1257
01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:51.011
Roy: The tears.

1258
01:29:51.095 --> 01:29:53.222
Let there be something left.

1259
01:30:34.722 --> 01:30:36.307
Eat your heart out.
Annie oakley.

1260
01:31:08.088 --> 01:31:11.842
Jeanne: I'm quite sure butterfield
does not expect us to settle our tab.

1261
01:31:12.885 --> 01:31:15.387
No. but we got
some unfinished business.

1262
01:31:17.473 --> 01:31:19.141
I never meant
to kill that sheriff!

1263
01:31:19.224 --> 01:31:20.225
Slim: Let's go. Please.

1264
01:31:20.309 --> 01:31:21.435
You got to believe me.

1265
01:31:21.518 --> 01:31:23.354
Slim: I found him cowering
under the bed.

1266
01:31:23.437 --> 01:31:25.064
Go on. tell him the truth!

1267
01:31:27.066 --> 01:31:29.276
When Otis took over my town.

1268
01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:31.528
I tried to escape.

1269
01:31:31.612 --> 01:31:33.822
Caught me a train
across the border.

1270
01:31:33.906 --> 01:31:35.783
Just so it happened.
them Samuel bandits

1271
01:31:35.866 --> 01:31:37.951
were working over horseshoe
at the same time.

1272
01:31:38.035 --> 01:31:40.954
stealing more folks for Otis
as the train passed through.

1273
01:31:41.038 --> 01:31:43.374
I didn't want them Samuels
bringing me back.

1274
01:31:45.334 --> 01:31:47.086
So. when I fired that gun...

1275
01:31:47.169 --> 01:31:49.421
I thought I was shooting
one of them.

1276
01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:50.881
Butterfield!

1277
01:31:50.964 --> 01:31:53.467
No. No. come here.

1278
01:31:54.093 --> 01:31:55.177
Go on!

1279
01:31:55.928 --> 01:31:57.429
I knew he was there.

1280
01:31:57.513 --> 01:31:59.973
I knew he was the weakest.

1281
01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:03.977
I had them fake bills printed
in order to save my own hide.

1282
01:32:04.061 --> 01:32:07.481
Why do you women even care
so much about that damn sheriff?

1283
01:32:07.564 --> 01:32:11.068
I know what Marcus aurelius
thinks about revenge.

1284
01:32:11.151 --> 01:32:13.445
But what does the Bible say.
and make it quick?

1285
01:32:13.529 --> 01:32:17.991
Roy. if I start quoting the Bible.
butterfield will die of old age.

1286
01:32:18.492 --> 01:32:21.161
You know what to do.

1287
01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:29.169
I heard that you lost your
lawman up there last night.

1288
01:32:29.253 --> 01:32:32.923
Is there anyone that you or the
town wanna elect as new sheriff?

1289
01:32:33.549 --> 01:32:34.883
Yes. there is.

1290
01:32:36.343 --> 01:32:37.344
Him.

1291
01:32:37.928 --> 01:32:38.929
Him? Me?

1292
01:32:39.722 --> 01:32:41.432
And I'm going to be his deputy.

1293
01:32:43.183 --> 01:32:44.309
All right. then.

1294
01:32:45.811 --> 01:32:48.313
You saw firsthand
where you're gonna end up.

1295
01:32:48.397 --> 01:32:51.108
There ain't nothing worse
that I can to you than that.

1296
01:32:51.191 --> 01:32:53.527
Take him away. Lock him up.

1297
01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:54.903
Deputy.

1298
01:32:57.322 --> 01:32:58.615
Let's go!

1299
01:32:58.699 --> 01:33:00.492
Julius. Ah!

1300
01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:03.245
Release me! Deado outlaw...

1301
01:33:03.328 --> 01:33:06.290
To deado lawman. You've
come a long way. son.

1302
01:33:07.791 --> 01:33:10.586
I guess you've earned the right
for us to know who you really are.

1303
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:12.129
Should we call you bumble?

1304
01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:16.008
No. Keep calling me slim.

1305
01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.510
I intend on bringing
only honor to the name.

1306
01:33:18.594 --> 01:33:21.722
We'll come get you when
your soul's retrial has been set.

1307
01:33:21.805 --> 01:33:23.348
But you step out of line here.

1308
01:33:23.432 --> 01:33:25.552
and we'll be coming back
for a whole different reason.

1309
01:33:26.268 --> 01:33:27.728
Message Roy-ceiphed.

1310
01:33:34.234 --> 01:33:35.903
Well...

1311
01:33:36.278 --> 01:33:40.908
I guess us ladies need to go
shopping for a couple of dresses.

1312
01:33:40.991 --> 01:33:41.992
Because_.

1313
01:33:44.953 --> 01:33:48.081
We cannot go to my daughter's
wedding looking like this!

1314
01:33:51.752 --> 01:33:53.003
Yeah. whatever that means!

1315
01:33:53.086 --> 01:33:55.798
It means. "oh. my god!"

1316
01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:04.515
Ladies and gentlemen. I present
to you Mr. and Mrs. Parker!

1317
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:08.101
Thank you so much.

1318
01:34:08.185 --> 01:34:09.311
Thank you.

1319
01:34:09.394 --> 01:34:10.729
Thank you.

1320
01:34:10.813 --> 01:34:12.356
There they are. Come on.

1321
01:34:12.439 --> 01:34:14.066
One second. one second.
Come on. come on.

1322
01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:16.151
Well. now.

1323
01:34:16.235 --> 01:34:18.779
Don't you two look
simply magnificent?

1324
01:34:19.321 --> 01:34:23.408
Good luck. Angus. After today you'll
face a far greater challenge than hell.

1325
01:34:23.492 --> 01:34:24.701
Marriage.

1326
01:34:24.785 --> 01:34:26.620
And you're gonna love
every second of it.

1327
01:34:26.787 --> 01:34:28.288
Uh...

1328
01:34:28.372 --> 01:34:29.665
Are you okay. Mabel?

1329
01:34:29.748 --> 01:34:31.828
'Cause I didn't understand
a word that you just said.

1330
01:34:35.879 --> 01:34:40.509
I think my sister must have
burned her tongue up there.

1331
01:34:40.592 --> 01:34:43.887
She said she couldn't be happier

1332
01:34:43.971 --> 01:34:47.391
for you and your beautiful wife.

1333
01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.179
Charlotte:
I know I just met her.

1334
01:35:26.263 --> 01:35:29.057
but it feels like I've known
Mabel my whole life.

1335
01:35:29.141 --> 01:35:30.434
Angus: I know.

1336
01:35:31.393 --> 01:35:32.936
She is very...

1337
01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:34.479
Otherworldly.

1338
01:35:40.277 --> 01:35:43.238
Roy: So tell me why Angus
can't understand me now.

1339
01:35:43.322 --> 01:35:46.617
Because now that you've
approved of your daughter's marriage.

1340
01:35:48.368 --> 01:35:51.955
your soul considers
Angus a loved one.

1341
01:35:52.039 --> 01:35:53.206
Hmm.

1342
01:35:54.625 --> 01:35:58.629
So. uh. what are we gonna do
with these here horses?

1343
01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:00.589
Let them go.

1344
01:36:00.672 --> 01:36:02.966
They'll be here for us
whenever we need them.

1345
01:36:10.265 --> 01:36:13.018
You know. I've
been thinking. I get it.

1346
01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:15.979
You're ripd for the
rest of your afterlife.

1347
01:36:16.063 --> 01:36:18.690
Duty. honor. servitude
and all that.

1348
01:36:19.191 --> 01:36:23.654
But between you and me and
the fencepost. I reckon' I'm done.

1349
01:36:24.321 --> 01:36:27.574
As soon as we're done
with this shitty ride here.

1350
01:36:27.658 --> 01:36:30.994
I'm gonna tell hano
to open up that portal

1351
01:36:31.078 --> 01:36:34.539
point me towards the sweet
warmth of eternal glory.

1352
01:36:35.207 --> 01:36:36.792
and send me on my way.

1353
01:36:39.252 --> 01:36:41.004
I want you to know.

1354
01:36:41.088 --> 01:36:44.591
I'm real glad to have served
with you and the ripd.

1355
01:36:46.176 --> 01:36:47.344
paflner

1356
01:36:55.727 --> 01:36:59.481
What... what's funny?

1357
01:36:59.564 --> 01:37:02.025
You didn't read
your contract. did you?

1358
01:37:02.109 --> 01:37:04.236
Hell. no. That thing
was thickerthan slim.

1359
01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:07.614
Well. eternal glory
does await you. Roy.

1360
01:37:08.824 --> 01:37:13.412
but only after you served your
minimum 100-year contract term.

1361
01:37:14.246 --> 01:37:16.665
One hundred years? Mmm-hmm.

1362
01:37:16.748 --> 01:37:20.544
Looks like you and me aren't
done with each other yet. partner.

1363
01:37:23.714 --> 01:37:24.715
Come on!

1364
01:37:34.516 --> 01:37:35.726
God damn it.

1365
01:37:36.643 --> 01:37:37.644
Sorry. boss.

1366
01:37:37.769 --> 01:37:40.355
What I meant to say was...
Damn it!
