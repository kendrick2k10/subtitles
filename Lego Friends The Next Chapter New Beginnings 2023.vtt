<i>Sorry for the cold open.</i>

27
00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:11.208

<i>That's me. Aliya.</i>

29
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.625
<i>Baking isn't really my thing. And...</i>

30
00:01:16.708 --> 00:01:19.208
Ouch! That really hurt!

31
00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:21.000
<i>That's Leo.</i>

32
00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:22.625
<i>He's soccer obsessed.</i>

33
00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:25.333
<i>He's actually got
mad cooking and baking skills.</i>

34
00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:27.875
<i>but he doesn't want us
to know that just yet.</i>

35
00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:30.916
- Huh?
- <i>That's Autumn.</i>

36
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.625
<i>She's obsessed with all animals.</i>

37
00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:36.708
<i>Wait. does she even know
what's happening right now?</i>

38
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:38.791
<i>Of course.
there are a pig and a puppy.</i>

39
00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:41.333
<i>That's Milo and Popsy. More on them later.</i>

40
00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:43.458
<i>Anyhow. we're in trouble.</i>

41
00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:46.166
Oh. hey. do you know where the--

42
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.583
<i>Like really big trouble.</i>

43
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:51.000
<i>Only three days
into my first year of high school.</i>

44
00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:53.166
<i>and my life is pretty much ruined.</i>

45
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.166
Whoa! I thought I was in a pickle.

46
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.083
As you can see. Principal Hale.

47
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.250
everything is under control.

48
00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:06.583
Fix this!

49
00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.500
Uh-oh.

50
00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:19.958
Not helpful.

51
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.583
Wait.

52
00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:26.958
Did anyone see a pig?

53
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.208
I know what you're thinking.

54
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:35.375
How can such a smart. talented girl

55
00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:37.875
have so thoroughly ruined
her entire academic career

56
00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.708
in less than a week?

57
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:42.791
Well. like my favorite
astrophysicist once said.

58
00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:45.041
"If you wanna know
how the big bang started.

59
00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:46.833
you gotta wind back the clock."

60
00:02:58.083 --> 00:02:59.250
<i>Me again.</i>

61
00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:01.583
<i>Well. past me.</i>

62
00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:03.916
<i>Hopeful. optimistic.</i>

63
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.708
<i>Gotta admit. my naivete is kinda adorable.</i>

64
00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.250
<i>The world was my oyster</i>

65
00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:13.250
<i>and I was gonna... open it?</i>

66
00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:15.750
<i>Hmm... Oysters aren't really
my thing either.</i>

67
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:17.500
<i>Anyway.</i>

68
00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:21.500
<i>All of my favorite role models
were head girls at their high schools.</i>

69
00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.625
<i>I wanted to be head girl so badly!</i>

70
00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:31.500
<i>Oh! My word of the day!</i>

71
00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:33.458
Hmm... "Sonder"!

72
00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:35.375
"The realization that everyone around you

73
00:03:35.458 --> 00:03:38.125
is living a life as difficult
and complex as your own."

74
00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:41.416
Well. if that isn't foreshadowing.

75
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.666
I don't know what is.

76
00:03:44.416 --> 00:03:47.416
<i>Leo! Again. we're not friends yet.</i>

77
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.833
<i>But he's a total unit in the kitchen.</i>

78
00:03:49.916 --> 00:03:51.583
<i>I mean. look at this kid!</i>

79
00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:53.166
<i>What a machine!</i>

80
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.208
<i>He also has a heart of gold.</i>

81
00:03:55.291 --> 00:03:57.500
<i>but I don't know that yet. either.</i>

82
00:03:57.583 --> 00:04:00.708
<i>You know what.
I'm gonna let Leo speak for himself.</i>

83
00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:04.416
This is the most important
week of the year.

84
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.083
New city. new school. new friends.

85
00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.750
Well. hopefully. new friends.

86
00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:16.208
I know how to make new friends. right?

87
00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:19.833
Don't get me wrong.

88
00:04:19.916 --> 00:04:22.208
it's cool to know your way
around the kitchen.

89
00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:26.666
<i>Desayuno. todos!</i>

90
00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.208
But the best way to make friends?

91
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:31.083
Is being an amazing athlete!

92
00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:33.541
<i>Fantastico!</i>

93
00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:36.000
Mmm!

94
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:37.583
You got this!

95
00:04:37.666 --> 00:04:38.583
Let's go!

96
00:04:40.375 --> 00:04:41.583
Ha!

97
00:04:41.666 --> 00:04:43.291
<i>Which brings us to Autumn.</i>

98
00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:45.208
<i>Again. not my friend... yet.</i>

99
00:04:45.291 --> 00:04:47.666
<i>But we've got to figure out
a way to work together.</i>

100
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.416
<i>Otherwise. none of us will succeed.</i>

101
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.916
<i>Which is so frustrating!</i>

102
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.375
<i>She's just as strong-willed as I am.
but our goals are totally opposite.</i>

103
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.666
<i>But I have a feeling
we're going to be great friends...</i>

104
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.666
<i>- ...eventually.</i>

105
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.166
<i>She'll tell you what's going on.</i>

106
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.250
Oh! Too many animals!

107
00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:07.125
We definitely don't have
enough room here at the stables.

108
00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:09.583
How am I going to find homes
for so many cuties?

109
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:14.166
Milo!

110
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.291
How's my piggie pig?

111
00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:18.458
I have yummy. yummy treats.

112
00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:22.916
Hey now! Those aren't for you!

113
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.166
Okay. How can I resist?

114
00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:30.375
Aw. I love you too!

115
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.041
For the tenth time. we've got to go!

116
00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.583
You don't want to be late
for your first day of school!

117
00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:46.625
Coming. Mom!

118
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:52.083
Today's your lucky day. Popsy!

119
00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:54.833
I'm gonna find a new home for you first!

120
00:06:02.916 --> 00:06:04.375
Excuse me. coming through!

121
00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.375
Hey! Over here. I'm open!

122
00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:20.750
You trying out for the team?

123
00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:23.541
<i>Por Supuesto!</i>

124
00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:25.208
You?

125
00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:26.750
Eh. maybe.

126
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.500
Wow! You're good.

127
00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:30.625
Let's go!

128
00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:39.583
Have a great first day!

129
00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:40.666
Thanks. Mom!

130
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.291
Milo!

131
00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:44.750
I'm gonna guess you didn't know
he was in the car.

132
00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:48.166
Actually. um...

133
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.833
Milo. great job listening to me!

134
00:06:50.916 --> 00:06:52.750
I told him to hop in the car.

135
00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:55.416
You know. to keep you company
on your way home!

136
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.250
Is he not the best pig?

137
00:06:57.333 --> 00:07:00.041
- Enjoy!
- They need homes. Autumn.

138
00:07:00.125 --> 00:07:01.625
They all need homes.

139
00:07:01.708 --> 00:07:02.875
Bye!

140
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.125
Hello. <i>willkommen. bienvenue.</i>

142
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:17.666

This one's for you.
Here's yours.

145

For you.

Here you go.

147
00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:28.541
She was at my last school.

148
00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:30.125
and now. she's the Principal here!

149
00:07:30.666 --> 00:07:31.958
Isn't she amazing?

150
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:34.333
Yep. Amazing.

151
00:07:34.416 --> 00:07:36.083
This week. we will be preparing

152
00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:37.666
for the Welcome to School Festival.

153
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.750
which will happen at the end of this week.

154
00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:43.333
Games. food. entertainment...

155
00:07:43.416 --> 00:07:44.958
Open your assignments!

156
00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.166
Social Media?

157
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.458
Okay.

158
00:07:49.541 --> 00:07:50.458
That's cool.

159
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:52.708
Lights. tech. and video?

160
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:54.666
Wait. does that mean costumes too?

161
00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:56.541
Promo?

162
00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:59.125
I guess I can do that?

163
00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:02.083
Ooh! Promo art! Score!

164
00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:03.583
Baking?

165
00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:06.333
Gee. that's not exactly my thing...

166
00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:09.416
Unless it's treats for you!

167
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.500
Baking? <i>Sí. por favor!</i>

168
00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:14.541
Baking?

169
00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:16.166
Maybe I can switch?

170
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.291
Aliya! I was excited to see
you were enrolled at Heartlake High!

171
00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:23.083
And I was excited to see
you're the Principal!

172
00:08:23.166 --> 00:08:24.416
Oh! Um...

173
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.250
I'm trying out for head girl!

174
00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:29.333
You would make an excellent head girl!

175
00:08:29.416 --> 00:08:32.416
We'll be evaluating the candidates
based on how well you do your assignments

176
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.416
for the Welcome to School Festival.

177
00:08:34.916 --> 00:08:36.250
Oh. uh... great!

178
00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:38.750
No problem. Baking... Easy-peasy!

179
00:08:38.833 --> 00:08:40.750
I could take care
of this whole list in my sleep.

180
00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:42.958
with my eyes closed. all by myself.

181
00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:48.083
I have no doubt.
but this is about teamwork.

182
00:08:48.166 --> 00:08:50.458
The best leaders value their teammates.

183
00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:52.250
Uh...

184
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.416
I got this!

185
00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:58.166
Whoa!

186
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.791
I'm open!

187
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.416
I'm good. thanks!
No prob... Whoa!

188
00:09:04.375 --> 00:09:05.291
Oh!

189
00:09:06.625 --> 00:09:08.208
Right! That's what I meant!

190
00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:09.916
Teamwork is my life!

191
00:09:12.791 --> 00:09:14.291
Seriously?

192
00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:15.708
"Teamwork is my life?"

193
00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:18.083
Focus on becoming head girl!

194
00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:19.375
You can do this!

195
00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:24.750
I just got crushed by lollipops.

196
00:09:24.833 --> 00:09:25.833
Me too.

197
00:09:25.916 --> 00:09:28.708
I don't know how she does it.
but she's always number one.

198
00:09:30.041 --> 00:09:31.791
Look. there she is!

199
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.291
Are you Nova?

200
00:09:38.375 --> 00:09:39.916
How are you always number one?

201
00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:43.333
Oh! Actually. I'm always number one.

202
00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:46.666
Uh. no. I'm always number one.

203
00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:51.291
Nova's so cool!

204
00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:53.833
There's no way she'd ever beat Nova.

205
00:09:54.416 --> 00:09:56.083
Hmm. we'll see about that.

206
00:10:05.708 --> 00:10:06.666
Yo. Leo!

207
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.875
Did you get your group assignment?
Mine's awesome.

208
00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.708
Stage building for the festival!

209
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:12.666
Oh. cool! I wonder who's singing?

210
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.791
Beats me. but I'll have front row seats!

211
00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:15.750
Nice!

212
00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:16.875
What were you assigned to?

213
00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.166
- I got bak--
- I'm on seat duty!

214
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.333
Not the best but way better than baking!

215
00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:24.916
Baking?

216
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.125
Can you imagine?

217
00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:27.625
Oh. that's the worst.

218
00:10:27.708 --> 00:10:29.041
I think I'd rather die!

219
00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:30.666
I know... right?

220
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.166
Who'd ever wanna bake?

221
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.625
I'm happy I'm on. uh...

222
00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:37.291
Oh!

223
00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:39.833
Uh. uh... Air Quality.

224
00:10:39.916 --> 00:10:42.833
I don't even know what that is.
but it sounds awesome!

225
00:10:42.916 --> 00:10:44.583
See you at tryouts!

226
00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:48.041
"Air quality"? Wow.

227
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.916
Nobody needs to know.
Soccer is what matters.

228
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.375
Soccer means friends.

229
00:10:55.833 --> 00:10:59.208
Hm. yeah. Soccer means friends.

230
00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:00.791
Soccer means friends.

231
00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:02.333
Soccer means friends.

232
00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:11.791
Oh. Popsy. He looks nice.

233
00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:13.666
What about him?

234
00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:15.083
Wait.

235
00:11:15.166 --> 00:11:16.625
Is that bacon?

236
00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:19.333
Oh! What if Milo saw that?

237
00:11:19.416 --> 00:11:20.333
Pass!

238
00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:22.875
Popsy. look at her!

239
00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.000
Right.

240
00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:26.166
Sorry about that.

241
00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:28.000
Ah.

242
00:11:30.083 --> 00:11:33.625
Oh! Too much perfume!

243
00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:37.041
Oh. we have to get to class.

244
00:11:37.125 --> 00:11:39.583
But don't worry. we'll try again later.

245
00:11:40.708 --> 00:11:41.666
{\an8}

246
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.458
That's her. She's the one!

247
00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:46.000
Nice find. Popsy!

248
00:11:46.083 --> 00:11:47.916
{\an8}-
Yeah!

249
00:11:54.625 --> 00:11:57.666
As it's the first days.
everything is still not in its place.

250
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.125
but I'm sure you will manage.

251
00:11:59.208 --> 00:12:00.708
Ah! Here they are!

252
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:03.041
- Oh!
- We were just filling Aliya in.

253
00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:06.250
Baking is the biggest job
for the Welcome to School Festival.

254
00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:09.000
which is why I've entrusted it
to the three of you.

255
00:12:09.083 --> 00:12:10.458
- Huh?
- Uh...

256
00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:13.416
Aliya was an amazing mentor
at our old school.

257
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.833
I know she can lead you all
to great success.

258
00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:18.250
You each have great talents to offer.

259
00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:20.625
We won't let you down.

260
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.000
Excellent! Well. I'll leave you
in Brad's capable hands!

261
00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.625
Okay. so. yeah.
You got this.

262
00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:30.875
And if you have any questions...

263
00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958
...figure it out for yourselves.

264
00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.750
So. hey!
We're on the same team!

265
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.333
Yay!

266
00:12:46.416 --> 00:12:48.625
Okay... So. yeah...

267
00:12:48.708 --> 00:12:51.625
I'm Aliya and you're... Leo?

268
00:12:51.708 --> 00:12:52.666
Leo!

269
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.000
Uh. yeah.

270
00:12:54.083 --> 00:12:55.750
And... Autumn?

271
00:12:58.666 --> 00:13:01.833
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Who knew she was allergic?

272
00:13:02.416 --> 00:13:06.125
We can't get stuck in this kitchen.
We have to find you a new home.

273
00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:09.416
This is no big deal.
I can do this whole job in my sleep.

274
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.583
<i>This is about team work</i>.

275
00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:13.916
<i>The best leaders value their teammates.</i>

276
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.000
Right. teamwork!

277
00:13:17.083 --> 00:13:18.458
Value your teammates.

278
00:13:18.541 --> 00:13:20.875
Okay. Autumn and Leo. here's the list.

279
00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.041
What would you like to do?

280
00:13:22.666 --> 00:13:25.416
- Uh. what's this one?
- Supplies!

281
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.500
Figure out what we need. make a big list.

282
00:13:27.583 --> 00:13:29.458
and cart it all here before the festival.

283
00:13:29.541 --> 00:13:31.083
Uh. wait.

284
00:13:31.166 --> 00:13:33.375
The kitchen supplies
aren't in... the kitchen?

285
00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:35.916
New school.
Everything's still in boxes.

286
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.166
New. used. donated.
there's a lot to sort through.

287
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.375
It's all in the cellar.

288
00:13:40.458 --> 00:13:41.375
Where's the cellar?

289
00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.541
Oh. it's that way.
Super easy to find.

290
00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:47.791
First. you take a left.
turn at the gym. count about 50 steps...

291
00:13:47.875 --> 00:13:49.416
<i>They need homes. Autumn.</i>

292
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.458
<i>- They all need homes.</i>
- Easy-peasy.

293
00:13:52.041 --> 00:13:53.000
Autumn?

294
00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:54.375
Are you with us?

295
00:13:54.458 --> 00:13:56.958
Yeah. totally! I'll take that!

296
00:13:57.666 --> 00:14:02.250
Okay... I thought I was going to do that.
but now I'm not. so...

297
00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:05.666
Here. take my brand new-notebook.

298
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.291
- Notebook?
- Yep. You'll love it!

299
00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:10.583
Look. you can write down
all the supplies we need.

300
00:14:10.666 --> 00:14:12.958
Then you can check them off
once you've put them on the cart.

301
00:14:13.041 --> 00:14:15.083
You can even make it color coded!

302
00:14:15.166 --> 00:14:16.916
Thanks! That's really nice of you.

303
00:14:17.708 --> 00:14:19.708
Okay. Leo.
what would you like to do?

304
00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:21.625
Baking or shopping?

305
00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:24.458
Uh... Uh...

306
00:14:24.541 --> 00:14:26.500
Anything but baking!

307
00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:28.000
If you say so.

308
00:14:28.083 --> 00:14:29.625
Then you can pick up the fruit.

309
00:14:29.708 --> 00:14:31.541
The order's been placed at Isaac's.

310
00:14:31.625 --> 00:14:35.291
According to what I've heard.
the vendor keeps really weird hours.

311
00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.333
Yeah. I got it.

312
00:14:37.916 --> 00:14:39.208
Um. okay!

313
00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:41.875
I guess that leaves me with...

314
00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.708
Baking... Ugh.

315
00:14:44.833 --> 00:14:48.416
Even though I'm. like.
the worst baker in the world!

316
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:57.583
Brad!

317
00:14:57.666 --> 00:14:59.166
Ah! Uh!

318
00:15:00.458 --> 00:15:01.916
Uh... Brad!

319
00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:10.958
Brad!

320
00:15:11.875 --> 00:15:13.291
Brad!

321
00:15:13.875 --> 00:15:15.125
Brad!

322
00:15:15.208 --> 00:15:17.291
Brad!

323
00:15:20.583 --> 00:15:21.458
Huh?

324
00:15:30.791 --> 00:15:31.708
Brad!

325
00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:34.333
Brad!

326
00:15:44.125 --> 00:15:45.083
Brad!

327
00:15:46.291 --> 00:15:47.583
Brad!

328
00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:53.875
Brad! Brad!

329
00:15:58.375 --> 00:15:59.833
- Brad!
- Ah!

330
00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:06.333
Uh?

331
00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:09.333
Oh! Watch it!

332
00:16:10.583 --> 00:16:13.125
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

333
00:16:14.916 --> 00:16:15.833
Phew.

334
00:16:17.666 --> 00:16:18.625
Brad!

335
00:16:21.916 --> 00:16:22.833
Brad?

336
00:16:24.708 --> 00:16:25.583
Brad!

337
00:16:26.166 --> 00:16:27.041
Uh-uh.

338
00:16:29.375 --> 00:16:30.416
- Brad?
- What?

339
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.708
- I found you!
- How did you?

340
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:34.208
Phew! You're a tough one to track down!

341
00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:35.291
Well...

342
00:16:35.375 --> 00:16:38.125
The truth is I. um...

343
00:16:38.208 --> 00:16:39.791
I don't know how to bake!

344
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:41.916
I was hoping you might have some pointers?

345
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.583
Anything to help me?

346
00:16:43.666 --> 00:16:45.458
That's why we have a library.

347
00:16:45.541 --> 00:16:47.958
Better yet. the internet.
Ever hear of that?

348
00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:50.541
Oh. thanks. Brad!
That's a great idea!

349
00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:54.000
A library!
The internet. books. videos!

350
00:16:54.083 --> 00:16:56.500
Of course!
Thanks again. Brad.

351
00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:58.958
- I knew I could count on you!
- Yeah. whatever.

352
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Huh?

353
00:17:03.541 --> 00:17:05.375
What are you staring at? Huh?

354
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.083
Uh... That's my doughnut.

355
00:17:33.708 --> 00:17:37.291
Wow. Niko. that was amazing!
You were like lightning!

356
00:17:37.916 --> 00:17:40.708
Leo. you're up!
Trying out for right wing.

357
00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:43.500
Uh... Yeah. Niko. great work!

358
00:17:45.458 --> 00:17:46.541
Hey. Coach?

359
00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:49.208
Mind if I try out for left wing
instead of right wing?

360
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:50.500
For real?

361
00:17:50.583 --> 00:17:51.958
Aren't you a righty?

362
00:17:52.041 --> 00:17:53.416
Sometimes.

363
00:17:54.041 --> 00:17:55.750
Well. let's see what you can do!

364
00:17:59.041 --> 00:17:59.916
Hm!

365
00:18:02.208 --> 00:18:04.666
<i>♪ I could try to be everybody's favorite ♪</i>

366
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.208
<i>♪ Or I could just be myself ♪</i>

367
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:09.875
<i>♪ Maybe I want to fake it till I make it ♪</i>

368
00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.750
<i>♪ But everybody needs a little help ♪</i>

369
00:18:11.833 --> 00:18:15.166
<i>- ♪ To go ♪
- ♪ Oh. oh. oh. oh. oh. oh ♪</i>

370
00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.958
<i>♪ And just be myself and let it show ♪</i>

371
00:18:22.166 --> 00:18:24.458
Haha! Well done!

372
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:26.416
Oh. man. we are stacked!

373
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.833
With Niko on right wing and Leo on left--

374
00:18:28.916 --> 00:18:31.208
Whoa. whoa. whoa. slow down there!

375
00:18:31.291 --> 00:18:33.166
I've got a lot to think about.

376
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.250
A lot.

377
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.250
I'll announce the team Friday
before the festival.

378
00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:40.208
Meet me here first thing
and don't be late!

379
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:42.583
Alright. that's all I can do for now.

380
00:18:42.666 --> 00:18:45.250
Now. I need to pull my weight
for the festival.

381
00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:47.916
Hey. Leo!
That was some playing out there.

382
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.291
I can't believe we have to wait two days!

383
00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:51.458
Brutal!

384
00:18:51.541 --> 00:18:52.708
Tell me about it!

385
00:18:52.791 --> 00:18:53.833
Yeah.

386
00:18:53.916 --> 00:18:55.916
Anyhow. we're headed to the diner.

387
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.250
- Joining us?
- Oh! Uh...

388
00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:01.416
Sounds awesome!

389
00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:02.833
Let's go!

390
00:19:21.916 --> 00:19:23.916
Huh?

391
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.208
I need more names. Popsy!

392
00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:29.500
We have a lot of furry friends
to find homes for.

393
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.041
Ooh! Muffin!

394
00:19:32.125 --> 00:19:33.541
That would make a good kitten's name!

395
00:19:33.625 --> 00:19:35.916
Aw. why not?

396
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.708
Ah! Muffins! Baking!

397
00:19:40.791 --> 00:19:42.166
The festival!

398
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:43.416
Shh!

399
00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:49.916
Psst! Hey. kid!

400
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.125
Do you know where the cellar is?

401
00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:53.166
- Olly.
- What?

402
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.541
My name is Olly.

403
00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:58.000
To the right. It's just down the hallway
at the bottom of the stairs.

404
00:19:58.083 --> 00:19:59.708
Thanks. Olly!

405
00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:01.458
Hey! What gives?

406
00:20:03.458 --> 00:20:04.666
Milo!

407
00:20:05.708 --> 00:20:06.875
Ah!

408
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.333
That's not
how you get to the cellar.

409
00:20:17.708 --> 00:20:20.333
All right.
recipes from three different countries.

410
00:20:20.416 --> 00:20:22.958
An international school
needs international baked goods.

411
00:20:23.041 --> 00:20:24.166
am I right?

412
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.041
No. no. no! Too complicated!

413
00:20:34.625 --> 00:20:35.500
Hmm...

414
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.500
Uh...

415
00:20:37.583 --> 00:20:39.375
Huh?

416
00:20:40.625 --> 00:20:42.083
- Hmm.
- Hi!

417
00:20:48.166 --> 00:20:50.250
Hmm...
Hmm! This one!

418
00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.208
Simple and delicious!

419
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:09.125
Pick me! Pick me!

420
00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:12.291
How could she miss it?

421
00:21:24.375 --> 00:21:25.666
Uh?

422
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.791
Hi!

423
00:21:26.875 --> 00:21:28.291
Huh?

424
00:21:35.666 --> 00:21:36.541
Ah.

425
00:21:38.833 --> 00:21:40.208
Huh! Yes!

426
00:21:40.291 --> 00:21:41.791
This is the one you need.

427
00:21:41.875 --> 00:21:43.666
Pick me. Pick me.

428
00:21:47.833 --> 00:21:49.750
No!

429
00:21:50.916 --> 00:21:53.625
Milo? Milo!

430
00:21:53.708 --> 00:21:55.333
Huh? Aw.

431
00:22:19.583 --> 00:22:23.041
<i>Coloque. coloquar...</i> "place"!

432
00:22:23.791 --> 00:22:25.875
Ooh. what if we added.
like. a dragon over here

433
00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:27.833
and made the school look like a castle?

434
00:22:27.916 --> 00:22:31.375
But maybe not have a princess in distress?

435
00:22:31.458 --> 00:22:35.000
Yeah! Good idea!
Let's put the dress on the dragon.

436
00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:42.583
Okay. the bus leaves right after school.

437
00:22:42.666 --> 00:22:45.125
I'll get there in plenty of time
before they close.

438
00:22:45.208 --> 00:22:46.583
<i>Sí!</i>
This is gonna work!

439
00:22:46.666 --> 00:22:48.458
Hey. Leo. Whatcha doin'?

440
00:22:48.541 --> 00:22:51.166
Wait. is that a playbook map?

441
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.458
This guy's dedicated!

442
00:22:54.666 --> 00:22:58.208
Dedicated. that's me.

443
00:23:01.625 --> 00:23:03.375
Look. Aditi and Matilde.

444
00:23:03.458 --> 00:23:06.625
They're desperate to adopt twin kittens.
but haven't been able to find any.

445
00:23:06.708 --> 00:23:08.416
They're helpful. loving. and. huh.

446
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.666
training to be the world's fastest
rollerblading pizza delivery team.

447
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.750
Wow. That's oddly specific.

448
00:23:13.833 --> 00:23:16.333
Hey. are you thinking what I'm thinking?

449
00:23:17.916 --> 00:23:19.458
Cookies and Cream!

450
00:23:20.583 --> 00:23:22.541
"Dear Aditi and Matilde.

451
00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:25.250
I have the perfect kittens for you."

452
00:23:33.583 --> 00:23:35.291
Ah. Well done.

453
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.500
That was quick!

454
00:23:39.583 --> 00:23:41.208
"Autumn. thank you so much!

455
00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:42.666
We are in love!"

456
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.583
Yay!

457
00:23:44.666 --> 00:23:46.500
Shh!

458
00:23:54.083 --> 00:23:56.000
Leo! You beat us here!

459
00:23:56.666 --> 00:23:57.833
Oh! Uh...

460
00:23:57.916 --> 00:23:59.916
I wanted to get here early
to grab us a table.

461
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.666
Now. that's what I call a team player!

462
00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.708
I was aiming for the right.
but the goalkeeper saw me.

463
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:10.625
but at the last minute.
I shot on the left side...

464
00:24:10.708 --> 00:24:11.833
<i>According to what I've heard.</i>

465
00:24:11.916 --> 00:24:13.583
<i>the vendor keeps really weird hours.</i>

466
00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:15.458
That would be a cool play for us.

467
00:24:15.541 --> 00:24:18.125
All of us!
Yeah. that would be great.

468
00:24:18.208 --> 00:24:19.208
Right. Leo?

469
00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.333
Be right back. guys.

470
00:24:20.416 --> 00:24:22.166
Uh... Bio brake.

471
00:24:23.708 --> 00:24:25.125
Uh... Uh...

472
00:24:25.708 --> 00:24:26.583
Uh...

473
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.125
You're not such a bad
team player. after all.

474
00:24:37.208 --> 00:24:39.500
Who said you can't be everything
to everyone?

475
00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:48.041
Uh...

476
00:24:48.125 --> 00:24:51.125
No!

477
00:24:57.375 --> 00:24:59.041
Huh? Shh!

478
00:24:59.125 --> 00:25:01.208
Shh!

479
00:25:03.333 --> 00:25:04.500
- Oh!
- Hi!

480
00:25:05.041 --> 00:25:06.416
Ah... Oh!

481
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.625
Hi!

482
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.875
- Hey. Autumn!
- Oh!

483
00:25:11.958 --> 00:25:13.958
Um... Hey. Aliya!

484
00:25:14.583 --> 00:25:18.083
I. um... just wanted to see
how the planning was going?

485
00:25:18.708 --> 00:25:20.750
Um. okay.

486
00:25:20.833 --> 00:25:22.583
Has the notebook been helpful?

487
00:25:22.666 --> 00:25:25.875
Yeah! I found homes for two of--
Uh... I found the homes

488
00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:28.208
of two of the most difficult
kitchen items to meow--

489
00:25:28.291 --> 00:25:29.208
Uh. I mean move!

490
00:25:29.291 --> 00:25:31.041
Are you... okay?

491
00:25:31.125 --> 00:25:32.666
No! I mean. yes!

492
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.000
I'm so okay!

493
00:25:35.083 --> 00:25:36.541
Yeah. super okay!

494
00:25:36.625 --> 00:25:38.333
I'm. like. super-duper fine!

495
00:25:38.416 --> 00:25:39.416
- So cute!
- Aw!

496
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.458
- Everything is peachy.
- Bye!

497
00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:43.166
Can I sneak a peek
at what you've found?

498
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.666
Did you use color codes?
Need any help?

499
00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.041
- Uh...
- Sorry!

500
00:25:49.125 --> 00:25:52.541
Not trying to tell you how to do things.
I'm sure you already know.

501
00:25:52.625 --> 00:25:55.291
Uh. anyhow... see you later!

502
00:25:55.958 --> 00:25:58.625
Good leaders let others make choices!

503
00:25:58.708 --> 00:26:01.708
Just hoping
it's not a complete disaster.

504
00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:03.958
Come on. Aliya. Autumn's got it.

505
00:26:05.333 --> 00:26:06.291
Phew!

506
00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:08.958
Uh... Popsy? Where are you?

507
00:26:11.125 --> 00:26:12.333
Popsy!

508
00:26:13.541 --> 00:26:14.416
Popsy?

509
00:26:14.916 --> 00:26:16.000
Popsy!

510
00:26:16.916 --> 00:26:17.875
Huh?

511
00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:26.208
I think we need
to speak to Principal Hale.

512
00:26:37.333 --> 00:26:38.291
Leo!

513
00:26:38.916 --> 00:26:41.291
How's it going?
Did you get everything you need for--

514
00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:43.166
For air quality?

515
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.708
Yep. totally!

516
00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:47.250
Air quality?
What even is that?

517
00:26:47.333 --> 00:26:49.125
Hey. Niko. can you give us a sec?

518
00:26:51.875 --> 00:26:54.833
What is going on?
Have you done anything for the festival?

519
00:26:54.916 --> 00:26:56.625
Of course. I have! Lots of things!

520
00:26:56.708 --> 00:26:58.625
Um... like what. exactly?

521
00:26:58.708 --> 00:26:59.875
Uh...

522
00:27:01.583 --> 00:27:03.541
I've been trying
to get to the vendors <i>cada día!</i>

523
00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:05.250
Everyday! <i>Y tú?</i>

524
00:27:05.333 --> 00:27:07.208
What have you been so busy doing?

525
00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:08.583
Uh...

526
00:27:11.166 --> 00:27:13.125
Looking for the perfect recipe.

527
00:27:13.208 --> 00:27:15.208
With the cookbooks you chose?

528
00:27:15.291 --> 00:27:16.291
Ay.

529
00:27:16.375 --> 00:27:18.000
If you thought I chose bad cookbooks.

530
00:27:18.083 --> 00:27:19.125
why didn't you tell me?

531
00:27:19.666 --> 00:27:21.208
Leo! Team's waiting!

532
00:27:21.291 --> 00:27:24.083
Uh... I gotta go.
Thanks. Aliya. Bye!

533
00:27:24.166 --> 00:27:25.416
That's it?

534
00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:27.250
Aw...

535
00:27:27.333 --> 00:27:29.000
I thought she was on baking?

536
00:27:29.083 --> 00:27:30.291
She's just nice.

537
00:27:30.375 --> 00:27:31.750
Tries to help everyone.

538
00:27:35.708 --> 00:27:37.375
- Uh-huh?
- Mmh...

539
00:27:37.458 --> 00:27:39.541
Mmh... Mm-hmm.

540
00:27:39.625 --> 00:27:44.250
Sorry about your pants!
Maybe I could... wash them for you?

541
00:27:45.125 --> 00:27:48.083
I'd like to give you the opportunity
to explain what's going on.

542
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.916
Why exactly have you been
bringing animals into school?

543
00:27:52.875 --> 00:27:56.166
Um. how many do you know about...?

544
00:27:58.208 --> 00:27:59.083
Right.

545
00:28:00.791 --> 00:28:03.541
So. the thing is. I love animals.
As much as they love me.

546
00:28:03.625 --> 00:28:05.333
And they just find me somehow.
when they need me!

547
00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:07.750
I have to help them.
Lately. a lot of animals have needed me.

548
00:28:07.833 --> 00:28:09.500
and now I have way too many
to find homes for.

549
00:28:09.583 --> 00:28:10.541
and it's really stressful.

550
00:28:10.625 --> 00:28:12.625
and I don't know
how to do school. and baking.

551
00:28:12.708 --> 00:28:14.333
and animal rescue all at the same time!

552
00:28:14.416 --> 00:28:16.000
And I made so many new friends.

553
00:28:16.083 --> 00:28:17.541
and I see how stressed they are.

554
00:28:17.625 --> 00:28:20.083
and I think. "Wouldn't they just be
so much happier with a new pet?"

555
00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:22.000
Pets can be great therapy. you know?

556
00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:23.708
I see.

557
00:28:24.708 --> 00:28:27.583
I could probably
use a little right now.

558
00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:31.375
Mm-hmm.

559
00:28:38.625 --> 00:28:40.625
Hey! Open up!

560
00:28:42.083 --> 00:28:43.208
Huh?

561
00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:44.166
Aw...

562
00:28:44.875 --> 00:28:47.875
Tomorrow's my last chance.

563
00:29:05.083 --> 00:29:05.958
Oh!

564
00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:15.958
Huh?

565
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.250
Uh?

566
00:29:42.333 --> 00:29:43.500
Ah!

567
00:29:46.291 --> 00:29:47.333
Ah!

568
00:30:09.291 --> 00:30:10.458
Oh!

569
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.166
They're burned!

570
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.625
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

571
00:30:18.708 --> 00:30:19.958
Uh.

572
00:30:20.041 --> 00:30:21.083
Ouch!

573
00:30:21.166 --> 00:30:23.000
No one can eat these!

574
00:30:23.083 --> 00:30:25.750
I'll never make head girl
if I'm this bad at baking!

575
00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:28.500
<i>This is about teamwork.</i>

576
00:30:29.416 --> 00:30:31.166
Right! My team!

577
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:32.708
Maybe there's still time!

578
00:30:38.041 --> 00:30:39.541
Thank you!

579
00:30:39.625 --> 00:30:41.500
Whoa! Ah! Huh!

580
00:30:41.583 --> 00:30:43.000
No time to lose. Ah!

581
00:30:48.916 --> 00:30:51.166
How are you all today?

582
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.416
You're more rested than I am!

583
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.833
Toughest first week of school ever!

584
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.000
I'm just happy it's over.

585
00:31:01.625 --> 00:31:03.708
Autumn!
Do you have everything you need

586
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:05.541
for the Welcome to School Festival?

587
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.250
Mom! It's Saturday!

588
00:31:09.333 --> 00:31:10.750
It's Friday!

589
00:31:10.833 --> 00:31:11.916
Oh. no!

590
00:31:12.583 --> 00:31:13.708
Oh. no. no. no!

591
00:31:13.791 --> 00:31:15.416
Today's Friday. isn't it?

592
00:31:16.416 --> 00:31:19.208
Ah! Popsy! Milo! Let's go!

593
00:31:19.291 --> 00:31:21.416
I'm gonna need all the help I can get!

594
00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:24.958
Coming. Mom!

595
00:31:31.583 --> 00:31:33.166
Uh! Sorry! Sorry!

596
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.541
Uh. little late. here!

597
00:31:44.333 --> 00:31:46.208
It's been a long first week.

598
00:31:46.291 --> 00:31:47.208
It was difficult.

599
00:31:47.291 --> 00:31:49.500
but I'm ready to announce
the starting lineup.

600
00:31:49.583 --> 00:31:51.958
Whether you made the cut or not.
you all did great.

601
00:31:53.958 --> 00:31:56.250
Has anyone seen Leo?

602
00:31:56.333 --> 00:31:57.750
He's not usually late.

603
00:32:01.125 --> 00:32:02.916
Psst. Hey. you!

604
00:32:03.583 --> 00:32:04.666
Are you going to the kitchen?

605
00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:06.625
Yeah. Why?

606
00:32:06.708 --> 00:32:09.083
Can you please take these
and put them away in the kitchen?

607
00:32:09.166 --> 00:32:10.666
Please. please. please.

608
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:12.416
Ha...

609
00:32:13.625 --> 00:32:14.625
Hmm. yeah.

610
00:32:14.708 --> 00:32:16.333
Thank you!

611
00:32:16.416 --> 00:32:19.083
I owe you one. Big time!

612
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.875
Ooh! Banana!

613
00:32:23.666 --> 00:32:24.958
Mmm...

614
00:32:32.541 --> 00:32:33.416
- Oh!
- Sorry!

615
00:32:36.166 --> 00:32:37.875
- Coach. I--
- Leo!

616
00:32:37.958 --> 00:32:40.291
One of the most important things
about being on a team

617
00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:42.583
is being there for the team.

618
00:32:42.666 --> 00:32:43.958
Where were you?

619
00:32:45.916 --> 00:32:48.166
Huh? Aww.

620
00:33:04.583 --> 00:33:05.708
Hmm.

621
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.291
Ooh. ice cream.

622
00:33:13.375 --> 00:33:14.583
Mmm!

623
00:33:18.375 --> 00:33:20.708
Mmm. It's good.

624
00:33:27.041 --> 00:33:29.291
Oh. running out of time here!

625
00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:33.250
Oh. no. no. no. no. no!

626
00:33:34.541 --> 00:33:36.333
Where is everything?

627
00:33:37.208 --> 00:33:38.166
Oh!

628
00:33:40.875 --> 00:33:41.875
Mm!

629
00:33:51.708 --> 00:33:54.875
Autumn! I'm so happy to see you!

630
00:33:54.958 --> 00:33:58.125
I need the mixing bowls. the mixer.
and measuring cups. and butter.

631
00:33:58.208 --> 00:34:00.041
food coloring. and sugar for icing.

632
00:34:00.458 --> 00:34:01.541
Where's the cart?

633
00:34:02.166 --> 00:34:03.916
I don't know. What cart?

634
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.875
<i>The</i> cart.

635
00:34:05.958 --> 00:34:07.458
The one with all the supplies

636
00:34:07.541 --> 00:34:09.875
that you've been tracking
in the notebook I gave you!

637
00:34:09.958 --> 00:34:11.416
Ha!

638
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.708
- Oh!
- Huh?

639
00:34:16.666 --> 00:34:17.958
Ah!

640
00:34:19.083 --> 00:34:20.583
Oh. not this too!

641
00:34:20.666 --> 00:34:23.000
How could brand-new boxes
of fruit just disappear?

642
00:34:23.083 --> 00:34:23.958
What?

643
00:34:24.041 --> 00:34:26.500
Did either of you do anything?

644
00:34:26.583 --> 00:34:27.875
This is going to make me look terrible

645
00:34:27.958 --> 00:34:29.541
in front of the principal!

646
00:34:29.625 --> 00:34:30.750
Oh!

647
00:34:30.833 --> 00:34:32.166
You did this on purpose!

648
00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:34.166
Ugh! How could you say that?

649
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.250
Why would I do any of this on purpose?

650
00:34:36.333 --> 00:34:37.625
Maybe this is your fault!

651
00:34:38.166 --> 00:34:39.791
Yeah! This isn't just about you!

652
00:34:39.875 --> 00:34:42.166
I can't believe it.
Nothing is going my way!

653
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:44.708
It's not just about you. either!

654
00:34:44.791 --> 00:34:46.458
You didn't tell me what to do!

655
00:34:46.541 --> 00:34:49.041
You signed up to get all the supplies!

656
00:34:49.125 --> 00:34:51.208
I told you where to go and what to get!

657
00:34:51.291 --> 00:34:53.500
I did everything right!
It's not my fault!

658
00:34:53.583 --> 00:34:55.583
Got up early. got to the store.
raced to school!

659
00:34:55.666 --> 00:34:57.875
But I still missed the team.
and someone lost my boxes!

660
00:34:57.958 --> 00:34:59.125
Whoa!

661
00:34:59.208 --> 00:35:01.416
<i>And you pretty much know
what happens next.</i>

662
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.416
<i>We don't have to relive everything.</i>

663
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:04.375
Whoa!

664
00:35:07.291 --> 00:35:08.958
Fix this!

665
00:35:10.583 --> 00:35:12.375
Huh?

666
00:35:12.458 --> 00:35:14.208
Oh!

667
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:16.958
Aw...

668
00:35:27.041 --> 00:35:28.375
What a disaster!

669
00:35:34.791 --> 00:35:37.625
At least my muffins
aren't as hard as rocks anymore.

670
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.458
Oh. my Aliya! These are truly...

671
00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:44.666
Awful?

672
00:35:47.333 --> 00:35:49.291
Now. this is what I call a disaster.

673
00:35:49.375 --> 00:35:51.458
You can say that again.

674
00:35:51.541 --> 00:35:54.083
We're doomed.
I'm doomed!

675
00:35:54.166 --> 00:35:57.458
This never would've happened
if I wasn't smuggling animals into school.

676
00:35:57.541 --> 00:35:58.666
What?

677
00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:00.625
You were smuggling animals into school?

678
00:36:01.416 --> 00:36:02.375
Huh?

679
00:36:02.458 --> 00:36:03.416
You brought a pig?

680
00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:06.000
- Yeah.
- But why?

681
00:36:06.083 --> 00:36:08.541
To help them find homes.

682
00:36:16.458 --> 00:36:18.583
Autumn! This book is fantastic!

683
00:36:18.666 --> 00:36:22.166
I can't believe how many people
you observed. interviewed.

684
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.083
They're matched up perfectly!

685
00:36:24.166 --> 00:36:25.458
Except for Coco.

686
00:36:25.541 --> 00:36:27.375
You're setting her up
with a kid in my science class

687
00:36:27.458 --> 00:36:28.375
who farts a lot.

688
00:36:36.875 --> 00:36:38.791
I'm sorry I kept getting distracted.

689
00:36:38.875 --> 00:36:40.375
I didn't know how to tell you.

690
00:36:40.458 --> 00:36:42.125
I messed everything up.

691
00:36:43.583 --> 00:36:44.916
Not more than I did!

692
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.791
I was just thinking about myself.

693
00:36:46.875 --> 00:36:49.750
But you. you were thinking
about helping others!

694
00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:52.625
We all made mistakes.

695
00:36:52.708 --> 00:36:55.708
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you
that I've never baked before.

696
00:36:55.791 --> 00:36:58.333
And I should have told you
how much I love baking.

697
00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:00.875
So. you do like baking!

698
00:37:00.958 --> 00:37:02.541
I knew it!

699
00:37:02.625 --> 00:37:04.416
Cooking and baking are my life.

700
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.708
Right next to soccer.

701
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.791
Autumn. are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

702
00:37:09.625 --> 00:37:11.625
I think it's time to fix this.

703
00:37:11.708 --> 00:37:12.833
On the count of three.

704
00:37:12.916 --> 00:37:14.916
One. two. three!

705
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.083
Go team!

706
00:37:17.166 --> 00:37:19.000
Thanks for coming. guys! You're the best.

707
00:37:19.083 --> 00:37:20.916
We can use all the help we can get.

708
00:37:21.458 --> 00:37:23.875
That's what friends do!
They help each other out.

709
00:37:23.958 --> 00:37:25.833
And what could be cooler than baking?

710
00:37:25.916 --> 00:37:27.166
Oh. my bad!

711
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:28.458
I know that's not what you call it.

712
00:37:28.958 --> 00:37:30.583
Guys?

713
00:37:35.333 --> 00:37:37.833
Air quality!

714
00:37:42.583 --> 00:37:45.333
Let's get this party started!

715
00:37:45.416 --> 00:37:48.125
Right. Tyler. I know you like dancing.

716
00:37:48.208 --> 00:37:50.750
Take this mop. That's your dance partner.

717
00:37:50.833 --> 00:37:52.250
Mathias. you're a great goalie.

718
00:37:52.333 --> 00:37:54.791
Grab your mitts
and make the countertops shine.

719
00:37:54.875 --> 00:37:57.416
Niko. I know you like
using those feet of yours!

720
00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.875
I'll tee up the trash bags.

721
00:37:58.958 --> 00:38:00.958
Just try not to kick them too hard!

722
00:38:01.041 --> 00:38:04.041
And. Leo. <i>Señor</i>.
Baker Extraordinaire.

723
00:38:04.125 --> 00:38:06.500
It's time for you
to show us what you're made of.

724
00:38:06.583 --> 00:38:07.958

Hey. Coach! Care for a hotcake?

774
00:40:34.708 --> 00:40:37.041
I care more about you being on time.

775
00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:41.041
But... now I understand a little more
about how busy you've been.

776
00:40:41.708 --> 00:40:43.083
Should I go long?

777
00:40:49.166 --> 00:40:50.500
Oh. impressive!

778
00:40:50.583 --> 00:40:53.875
For the record. you made the team
before I knew you could cook.

779
00:40:55.208 --> 00:40:57.541
Wait! I made the team? I made the team!

780
00:40:57.625 --> 00:41:01.000
Yeah!

781
00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:07.666
This is fantastic!

782
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.583
What did I tell you?

783
00:41:12.666 --> 00:41:14.000
Amazing. right?

784
00:41:14.083 --> 00:41:15.541
Who wants a hotcake?

785
00:41:15.625 --> 00:41:17.041
Me. me. me!

786
00:41:18.916 --> 00:41:20.041
Milo?

787
00:41:20.125 --> 00:41:21.666
Did anyone see a pig?

788
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.375
Milo. where are you?

789
00:41:24.125 --> 00:41:25.250
Milo!

790
00:41:25.333 --> 00:41:26.208
Autumn?

791
00:41:26.833 --> 00:41:28.125
This is Dr. Marlon.

792
00:41:28.208 --> 00:41:29.166
Hi.

793
00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:31.833
Oh. I know all about you. Autumn.

794
00:41:31.916 --> 00:41:34.208
You've been helping
a lot of animals this week.

795
00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:37.291
I've been thinking about
creating a dog adoption center.

796
00:41:37.375 --> 00:41:40.500
And I think you'd be perfect
at helping build it.

797
00:41:40.583 --> 00:41:42.750
Oh! I'd love to help!

798
00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:44.458
Ooh. this is amazing!

799
00:41:44.541 --> 00:41:46.000
Thank you so much!

800
00:41:46.083 --> 00:41:48.791
Popsy thanks you too.

801
00:41:48.875 --> 00:41:50.750
- Aw!
- Happy to help.

802
00:41:50.833 --> 00:41:53.666
And if you can't find a new home
for this little one.

803
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.416
I might just have to keep her for myself.

804
00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.250
{\an8}- Did you hear that. Popsy?

805
00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:01.083
So. how was the first week of school?

806
00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:03.708
Well. it turned out amazing.

807
00:42:03.791 --> 00:42:06.041
but it was pretty rocky there for a while.

808
00:42:06.125 --> 00:42:08.041
We made a lot of mistakes.

809
00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:10.791
It was pretty stressful. that's for sure.

810
00:42:10.875 --> 00:42:12.875
which brings me to my next surprise.

811
00:42:12.958 --> 00:42:15.083
Puppy love for everyone!

812
00:42:15.166 --> 00:42:16.375
{\an8}-

813
00:42:16.458 --> 00:42:21.000
Congratulations on making it
through the first week of school!

814
00:42:25.083 --> 00:42:26.291
I made this for the puppy.

815
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.083
I hope you like it.

816
00:42:28.166 --> 00:42:29.708
Oh. thank you.

817
00:42:29.791 --> 00:42:32.166
So. I guess you saw Popsy.

818
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.041
I was trying to keep her secret.

819
00:42:34.125 --> 00:42:35.625
Well. that didn't work.

820
00:42:35.708 --> 00:42:36.625
Come here. girl.

821
00:42:36.708 --> 00:42:39.250
Aw! It's so cute.

822
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.083
I think you did
a great job this week. Aliya.

823
00:42:43.166 --> 00:42:45.166
Mistakes are opportunities to learn.

824
00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:46.875
That made the difference today.

825
00:42:46.958 --> 00:42:49.208
That's what Heartlake High is all about.

826
00:42:49.291 --> 00:42:52.041
And that's why I'm making you head girl.

827
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.500
Ah!

828
00:42:55.583 --> 00:42:57.375
Thank you. thank you. thank you!

829
00:42:57.458 --> 00:43:00.291
You won't be disappointed.
I promise you that.

830
00:43:00.375 --> 00:43:03.375
Congrats on head girl.
You'll never beat me on the leaderboards.

831
00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:06.458
but I think we can both share
number one in the metaverse.

832
00:43:06.541 --> 00:43:07.875
Meta-what?

833
00:43:08.583 --> 00:43:10.416
Aliya. I'm ready
for your first baking lesson

834
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:11.583
whenever you are.

835
00:43:11.666 --> 00:43:13.833
I'm all ears.

836
00:43:13.916 --> 00:43:15.833
It's just a costume!

837
00:43:15.916 --> 00:43:18.375
I didn't even know pigs liked pickles!

838
00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:25.541
