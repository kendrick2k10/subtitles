3
00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:27.667
The good comes with the
bad. the happy with the sad.

4
00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:31.834
Heartache with a love.
diamond with the dust.

5
00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:36.083
Joy comes with the pain.
night comes with the day.

6
00:00:36.083 --> 00:00:40.208
Different but the same. wrong
turns but the right way.

7
00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:44.792
Hurt makes me much stronger.

8
00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:53.375
Bruise signs I am stronger.

9
00:00:56.583 --> 00:01:04.125
Raise your hand if
you're stronger.

10
00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:38.125
Salt in the sea.

11
00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:43.083
Bruise signs I am stronger.

12
00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:54.834
Raise your hand if
you're stronger.

13
00:01:54.834 --> 00:02:00.000
Raise your hand if you are--

14
00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:05.709
Who is it?

15
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:06.417
Police officer.

16
00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:11.083
How can I help you?

17
00:02:11.083 --> 00:02:12.667
Is Linda Blake there?

18
00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:13.208
Why?

19
00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:15.333
Linda allegedly
killed a few people.

20
00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.166
And if you're
protecting her. you'll

21
00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:18.834
be arrested for
harboring a fugitive.

22
00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:19.667
Now. open the door.

23
00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:46.875
When is enough. enough?

24
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.125
That kick in the face when
you're down. so rough.

25
00:02:56.125 --> 00:03:01.750
The system is rigged
and we know it. yeah.

26
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.667
The pain is written
out on the wall.

27
00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:05.625
but they keep it a secret.

28
00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:07.834
Nobody knows.

29
00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:09.792
Nobody knows.

30
00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:13.250
The troubles I've seen.
the places I've been.

31
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.834
The fires I've walked
through. neither do you.

32
00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:19.625
Nobody knows.

33
00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:20.667
Morning. class.

34
00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:26.041
Today is one of the most
important days of your life.

35
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:29.375
I'm going to be assigning
everybody a case study.

36
00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:33.250
It will be 75% of the grade.

37
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.625
Professor. when we
visit the patients.

38
00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:37.000
is there a protocol
in place just

39
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.750
in case the crisis breaks out?

40
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.917
You will be going to the
rehabilitation center.

41
00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:44.917
and you'll have security.

42
00:03:44.917 --> 00:03:46.750
Is the facility safe?

43
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.375
If you take in everything
that you learned in class.

44
00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:51.542
everything will be fine.

45
00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:53.583
Where do these people come from?

46
00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:55.750
All over the world.

47
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.291
What's the worst that ever
happened to a patient?

48
00:03:58.291 --> 00:03:59.583
Became a serial killer.

49
00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:06.250
OK. this class is dismissed.

50
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.375
Tasha. can you stay?

51
00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:10.417
I want to discuss
your case with you.

52
00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:10.917
OK.

53
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.125
Hey. nurse Denise.

54
00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:19.750
Yes.

55
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.917
Listen. we'll be having another
group of interns coming in.

56
00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:25.917
to do a study on the
residents that we have here.

57
00:04:25.917 --> 00:04:30.458
Please. please. assist them
in any way possible. OK?

58
00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:30.959
OK.

59
00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:35.041
They'll be here
Wednesday about 09:00 AM.

60
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:36.291
Doctor Jackson.

61
00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:38.500
Are you sure?

62
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.083
Yeah.

63
00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:43.166
They're being a rude
awakening with these patients.

64
00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:44.500
Tell me about it.

65
00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:49.667
Sorry.

66
00:04:57.375 --> 00:05:00.125
Have you told your family yet?

67
00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:01.667
No. I haven't said anything yet.

68
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.333
Please. sit.

69
00:05:14.667 --> 00:05:16.458
Thanks for picking me up. Dad.

70
00:05:16.458 --> 00:05:18.208
No problem. baby.

71
00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:20.792
Any time.

72
00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:22.667
Can you give mom a
call. real quick.

73
00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:23.166
OK.

74
00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:25.709
Let her know we'll be there
in about 20 minutes or so.

75
00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:27.125
Uh-huh.

76
00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:27.625
Thanks.

77
00:05:31.041 --> 00:05:34.959
I want you to talk with
the counselor on Thursday.

78
00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.667
I'll think about it.

79
00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:37.875
How am I doing?

80
00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:39.458
How is my health?

81
00:05:39.458 --> 00:05:41.917
I was just about to ask
you the same question.

82
00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:45.709
Well. like I said before. I'm
in a lot of pain. it like hurts.

83
00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:48.000
It's red and swollen.

84
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.583
I feel like something's pulling.

85
00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:53.375
There's scabs. I mean--

86
00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:55.417
It's very painful.

87
00:05:55.417 --> 00:05:56.375
Yes.

88
00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:58.834
Those are symptoms
to your cancer.

89
00:05:58.834 --> 00:06:01.375
As I mentioned before.
you have a rare cancer

90
00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:06.041
that one out of 100
get. Paget cancer.

91
00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:10.000
which is a cancer
in or on the nipple.

92
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.583
Misses Cleaver. I
know it's not easy.

93
00:06:13.583 --> 00:06:15.917
That's an understatement.

94
00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.458
But I'm a survivor.

95
00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:21.125
Let's do what we have to do.

96
00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:23.709
Yes. that's what
we intend to do.

97
00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:25.792
After you're
radiation therapy. I

98
00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:28.333
want you to take
anti estrogen pills.

99
00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:30.875
Then we will remove your breast.

100
00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:32.500
Remove my breast.

101
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.709
Can't you just cut
the cancer out?

102
00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:37.375
Um.

103
00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:41.792
We can just remove the cancer
but according to the scans.

104
00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:43.583
the cancer has spread.

105
00:06:43.583 --> 00:06:48.041
And the only way I can
give you 99% survival.

106
00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:49.709
is by removing your left breast.

107
00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:59.709
So. how was your
day today at school?

108
00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:02.792
It was great.

109
00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:04.583
I'm really excited
about my new assignment.

110
00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:08.750
But I will tell you
and mom at dinner.

111
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.959
OK.

112
00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:11.417
Just make sure to
give her a call--

113
00:07:11.417 --> 00:07:12.250
OK.

114
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.166
All right. all right--

115
00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:14.542
Just sending a text real quick.

116
00:07:20.583 --> 00:07:22.375
Dr. Ortiz' office.
how may I help you?

117
00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:27.208
Sure.

118
00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:28.291
Have you been here before?

119
00:07:32.166 --> 00:07:33.000
OK.

120
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.083
Can you come in Friday
the 4th at 10:00 AM?

121
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:42.959
OK.

122
00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:46.208
Please bring your insurance
card and a photo ID.

123
00:07:46.208 --> 00:07:48.125
And please come 15
minutes earlier so that we

124
00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:51.458
can complete your paperwork.

125
00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:52.375
OK. Mrs. Cleaver.

126
00:07:52.375 --> 00:07:53.583
Thank you. see you on Friday.

127
00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:03.875
Hi mom. dad. and I should
be home in about 20 minutes.

128
00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:05.291
It was really good.

129
00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:08.875
I have some exciting
news for you.

130
00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:10.041
OK.

131
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:11.542
We'll see you soon.

132
00:08:11.542 --> 00:08:13.750
Love you. bye.

133
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.542
What'd she say?

134
00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:18.250
We have to pick
up some red wine.

135
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.208
I should've known.

136
00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:25.542
No problem.

137
00:08:25.542 --> 00:08:27.959
Hey. honey.

138
00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:29.542
How was work?

139
00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:33.375
Today I gave my students their
case study for the semester.

140
00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:34.583
How did it go?

141
00:08:34.583 --> 00:08:36.000
It went well. babe.

142
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.458
But I have to keep my
eyes on my students

143
00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:40.792
because the case studies
are getting harder.

144
00:08:40.792 --> 00:08:43.792
And they might get discouraged.

145
00:08:43.792 --> 00:08:46.208
Honey. everything's
going to be fine.

146
00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:47.500
You did great last year.

147
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.667
This year should
be no different.

148
00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:51.250
Now go take your shower. stinky.

149
00:08:58.041 --> 00:09:00.208
So honey. how was your day?

150
00:09:00.208 --> 00:09:04.667
Babe. Lenny came in
with this crazy theory.

151
00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:07.000
I tell you. this guy is always
coming up with something.

152
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.500
So we were talking
about the phrase.

153
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.166
the truth will set
you free. right.

154
00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:12.291
And he says. no
one ever tells you

155
00:09:12.291 --> 00:09:14.000
everything you
have to go through

156
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.542
in order to be set free.

157
00:09:15.542 --> 00:09:18.542
So I was like. OK. I
get you. I get you.

158
00:09:18.542 --> 00:09:21.166
Nobody tells you about the pain
and the hurt you go through.

159
00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:24.000
The reality of the truth
staring you in the face.

160
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
The shock of the truth. whether
it's bad or good et cetera.

161
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.041
So it's like. the truth will
set you free is a very. very

162
00:09:31.041 --> 00:09:33.000
strong statement.

163
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.500
Do you have the
list of the patients

164
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.417
that the students will
be working on tomorrow?

165
00:09:36.417 --> 00:09:37.041
Yes.

166
00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:40.417
And they're scheduled to
take their bath at 7:00 AM.

167
00:09:40.417 --> 00:09:41.875
Here's the list.

168
00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:45.667
And if we stick to the
plan. that would be great.

169
00:09:45.667 --> 00:09:46.166
OK.

170
00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:47.875
Thank you. Nora. I'll
check with you later.

171
00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:48.375
OK.

172
00:09:52.875 --> 00:09:54.834
So. how was your day. Tasha?

173
00:09:54.834 --> 00:09:57.792
Well. mom. dad.

174
00:09:57.792 --> 00:10:01.500
I got my case assignment
for the semester today.

175
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.417
Oh wow.

176
00:10:02.417 --> 00:10:03.041
Awesome.

177
00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:03.959
That's great.

178
00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:06.291
So why don't you tell me
a little bit about it?

179
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:10.250
My case study's
name is Linda Blake.

180
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.250
She's in for murder.

181
00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:32.000

Does it matter?

197
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.917
Yes. it does.

198
00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:27.625
Maybe you should think so too.

199
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.500

Little girl. first lesson.

206
00:12:00.542 --> 00:12:03.000
If you want to know
anything about anyone.

207
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.375
you have to give a
little of yourself.

208
00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:08.917
So I will ask you again.
can you tell me about you?

209
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.375
I'm 23 years old.

210
00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:19.208
I'm studying psychology and
you're my first patient.

211
00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:22.000
More.

212
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.792
I'm the only child
that my parents have.

Are you OK?

228
00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:35.959

229
00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:39.417

from the doctor's office.

230
00:13:39.417 --> 00:13:41.375

00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:04.709
Hi. Linda.

238
00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:06.959
How are you today?

239
00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:08.041
Better than you.

240
00:14:08.041 --> 00:14:10.583
You got to put all
of us up together.

241
00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.542
Good luck.

242
00:14:12.542 --> 00:14:14.458
OK.

243
00:14:14.458 --> 00:14:18.834
Well. see it's
time for your meds.

244
00:14:18.834 --> 00:14:19.500
You ready?

245
00:14:56.166 --> 00:14:57.166
Are you OK?

246
00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:23.792
So you're back.

247
00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:26.625
What do you want?

248
00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:27.667
I want to know about you.

249
00:15:39.792 --> 00:15:42.417
I was seven years old.

250
00:15:42.417 --> 00:15:48.250
My first foster parents.
Mabel and Charlie Anderson.

251
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.750
I love Mabel.

252
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.291
But Charlie always
kept his distance.

253
00:15:54.834 --> 00:16:00.083
He will go to work all day.
and then go to the study room.

254
00:16:00.083 --> 00:16:01.834
He won't come out
until dinner was done.

255
00:16:04.792 --> 00:16:08.750
One day. Charlie picked
me up from school.

256
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.291
He said. it was time for us
to get to know each other.

257
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:15.667
He let me sit in the front seat.

258
00:16:15.667 --> 00:16:18.583
He gave me a bag of candy.

259
00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:21.417
I love candy.

260
00:16:21.417 --> 00:16:23.875
Do you have a payday?

261
00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:24.959
No. I don't.

262
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.417
When we got in. he said that
I can go to the study room

263
00:16:31.417 --> 00:16:31.959
with him.

264
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.875
I've never been
to the study room.

265
00:16:38.875 --> 00:16:41.458
Young lady. can
you ----

266
00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:44.583
Thank you.

267
00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:54.625
We went upstairs.

268
00:16:57.166 --> 00:17:00.250
And he said. you can have
all this when you grow up.

269
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.959
Young lady.

270
00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:17.417
Exodus 20:12. "Thou shall
obey your father and mother

271
00:17:17.417 --> 00:17:19.709
in the land of the Lord."

272
00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:22.709
What do you think
about that. young lady?

273
00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.125
I'll honor my father
and my mother.

274
00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:27.041
Very good.

275
00:17:27.041 --> 00:17:29.083
Linda. go to your room.

276
00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:53.250
He went to another scripture.

277
00:17:53.250 --> 00:18:00.000
Ephesians 6:3. "Obey
your father and mother".

278
00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:12.125
He unbuttoned his pants
and laid on top of me.

279
00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:16.750
He whispered in my ear
I love you. my child.

280
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.792
I couldn't breathe.

281
00:18:18.792 --> 00:18:20.875
He was hurting me.

282
00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:23.959
I was in pain.

283
00:18:23.959 --> 00:18:29.542
A few moments later. he
got up and left my room.

284
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.125
I lay there crying.

285
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.250
mama Mabel got home.

286
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.333
She came to my room.

287
00:18:41.333 --> 00:18:43.041
Linda?

288
00:18:43.041 --> 00:18:44.458
Honey?

289
00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:45.375
Sweetheart.

290
00:18:48.083 --> 00:18:49.291
How was school today?

291
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:53.750
Oh my god.

292
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.458

293
00:18:54.458 --> 00:18:55.000

294
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.375
What happened to Linda?

295
00:18:57.375 --> 00:18:58.625
I don't know.

296
00:18:58.625 --> 00:19:01.208
Oh my god.

297
00:19:01.208 --> 00:19:01.959

I told her everything.

304
00:19:16.125 --> 00:19:17.959
I never returned
back to the house.

305
00:19:20.542 --> 00:19:23.625
Later on. I found out that
mama Mabel hung herself.

306
00:19:32.583 --> 00:19:35.250

00:23:35.041 --> 00:23:37.291
right so we can get
you back into society.

368
00:23:37.291 --> 00:23:37.792
All right?

369
00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:38.959
That's our goal for today.

370
00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:40.208
That's what we're going to do.

371
00:23:40.208 --> 00:23:40.875
OK. here we go.

372
00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:42.458
Let's start exercising.

373
00:23:42.458 --> 00:23:43.500
Let's start exercising.

374
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.250
Start moving the machine.

375
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.834
Work it.

376
00:23:46.834 --> 00:23:49.125
Remember what I
told you. breathing.

377
00:23:49.125 --> 00:23:51.208
Breathing is very important.

378
00:23:51.208 --> 00:23:53.458
Two out the mouth.
one in the nose.

379
00:23:53.458 --> 00:23:54.458
Focus.

380
00:23:54.458 --> 00:23:55.583
Tighten up on this grip.

381
00:23:55.583 --> 00:23:56.625
Wrap your hands around.

382
00:23:56.625 --> 00:23:57.125
It's OK.

383
00:23:57.125 --> 00:23:58.125
It's all right.

384
00:23:58.125 --> 00:24:01.000
All right.

385
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.458
Lock your hands on.

386
00:24:02.458 --> 00:24:03.667
What are you looking at?

387
00:24:03.667 --> 00:24:05.125
Look at the wall.
don't look at me.

388
00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:05.834
Stay focused.

389
00:24:05.834 --> 00:24:06.750
nice work.

390
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.250
Shut up!

391
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.750
Two out the mouth.
one in the nose.

392
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.083
Let's control the heart rate.

393
00:24:10.083 --> 00:24:11.333
Let's control the heart rate.

394
00:24:11.333 --> 00:24:12.458
Don't look at me.
look at the wall.

395
00:24:12.458 --> 00:24:13.500
What are you looking at?

396
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.333
Hands here.

397
00:24:14.333 --> 00:24:15.250
This is your security.

398
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.625
Are you crying?

399
00:24:16.625 --> 00:24:17.250
Take your time.

400
00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:18.792
Take your time. all right.

401
00:24:18.792 --> 00:24:19.625
Focus on you.

402
00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:20.917
Block out everything else.

403
00:24:20.917 --> 00:24:22.208
This is about you today.

404
00:24:22.208 --> 00:24:23.125
All right.

405
00:24:23.125 --> 00:24:25.834
We're in a competition
with no one but ourselves.

406
00:24:25.834 --> 00:24:26.750
So let's work.

407
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.250
OK?

408
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:27.750
Mister!

409
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.542
You all right?

410
00:24:28.542 --> 00:24:29.041
Mister!

411
00:24:29.041 --> 00:24:30.250
Give it a little bit more.

412
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:30.750
Mister!

413
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.083
Just give a little bit more.

414
00:24:32.083 --> 00:24:32.625
There you go.

415
00:24:32.625 --> 00:24:33.125
Thank you.

416
00:24:33.125 --> 00:24:33.709
Thank you.

417
00:24:33.709 --> 00:24:34.667
Thank you for focusing.

418
00:24:34.667 --> 00:24:37.917
Hey. look!

00:24:48.458 --> 00:24:52.250
If you could please
reschedule the ones for today

425
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.583
and put them in
tomorrow's time slot.

426
00:24:54.583 --> 00:24:56.250
And you can keep Sharon Basely.

427
00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.041
OK.

428
00:24:57.041 --> 00:24:58.542
Thank you so much. Enda.

429
00:24:58.542 --> 00:25:00.166
I don't want to be interrupted.

430
00:25:00.166 --> 00:25:02.750
So unless it's
extremely important.

431
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.250
OK. miss Cleaver. no problem.

432
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.166
Thank you.

433
00:25:19.834 --> 00:25:20.875
Come on. come on.

434
00:25:24.583 --> 00:25:25.583
I'm sorry. Miss Cleaver.

435
00:25:25.583 --> 00:25:29.417
But your husband is on line one.
he said it's very important.

436
00:25:29.417 --> 00:25:30.083
All right.

437
00:25:30.083 --> 00:25:31.250
Thank you. Jenny. thank you.

438
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.000
OK.

439
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Close the door please.

440
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.500
Sure.

441
00:25:36.959 --> 00:25:37.750
Hello?

442
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.542
Babe. hey. how are you doing?

443
00:25:41.542 --> 00:25:42.625
Everything OK?

444
00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:43.333
Yeah.

445
00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:45.583
I'm taking it easy. you know.

446
00:25:45.583 --> 00:25:47.542
I'm just at work.

447
00:25:47.542 --> 00:25:48.125
All right.

448
00:25:48.125 --> 00:25:51.834
Regarding the research.
I need you to just relax.

449
00:25:51.834 --> 00:25:54.291
Sit back. enjoy your day. I'm
going to take care of it. OK.

450
00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:56.125
I don't want you to
stress yourself out.

451
00:25:56.125 --> 00:25:57.542
I love you so much.

452
00:25:57.542 --> 00:25:58.625
Yeah I got it.

453
00:25:58.625 --> 00:25:59.959
Don't worry about it.

454
00:25:59.959 --> 00:26:02.208
I'll take care of it.

455
00:26:02.208 --> 00:26:04.083
Yes. relax OK.

456
00:26:04.083 --> 00:26:05.000
I'll see you soon.

457
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.625
I love you too.

458
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.000
It ain't easy.

459
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.875
To go against the grain.

460
00:26:32.625 --> 00:26:37.291
And it ain't easy
to ignore the pain.

461
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:41.959
You're back.

462
00:26:41.959 --> 00:26:44.125
You ready for more?

463
00:26:44.125 --> 00:26:46.542
Yes.

464
00:26:46.542 --> 00:26:49.333
How'd you sleep?

465
00:26:49.333 --> 00:26:52.083
I don't sleep well at night.

466
00:26:52.083 --> 00:26:54.792
I can't let him in my room.

467
00:26:54.792 --> 00:26:56.917
Him?

468
00:26:56.917 --> 00:26:57.875
Who. Linda?

469
00:27:11.333 --> 00:27:14.583
Mama Lucille took
me to the park.

470
00:27:14.583 --> 00:27:17.083
We played on the swings.

471
00:27:17.083 --> 00:27:19.792
I was nine years old.

472
00:27:19.792 --> 00:27:25.875
Mama Lucille and James Lander
where my foster parents.

473
00:27:25.875 --> 00:27:27.000
I love mama Lucille.

474
00:27:29.542 --> 00:27:31.500
James was always
at home drinking.

475
00:27:35.875 --> 00:27:39.083
One day we got in
and mama Lucille

476
00:27:39.083 --> 00:27:44.041
got a phone call that her
mom was in the hospital.

477
00:27:44.041 --> 00:27:45.792
She says she had to go.

478
00:27:45.792 --> 00:27:47.166
I begged to go with her.

479
00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:53.041
She said they didn't
allow kids in the ICU.

480
00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.583
I started crying and
I peed on myself.

481
00:28:03.542 --> 00:28:06.834
Mama Lucille asked
me what's wrong.

482
00:28:06.834 --> 00:28:08.083
But I didn't answer.

483
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.125
She said. you're
going to be fine.

484
00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:15.583
James gonna take care of you.

485
00:28:34.166 --> 00:28:35.125
Nasty little girl.

486
00:28:35.125 --> 00:28:36.458
Go upstairs and take a shower.

487
00:28:36.458 --> 00:28:37.625
Let's go!

488
00:28:37.625 --> 00:28:38.125
Come on.

489
00:28:45.458 --> 00:28:46.333
Get in that bathroom.

490
00:28:46.333 --> 00:28:47.709
Come one. you're
wasting my time!

491
00:28:52.166 --> 00:28:57.917
And threw me in the hot
water with salt. It burned.

492
00:29:02.834 --> 00:29:04.041
He said. get on your knees.

493
00:29:07.458 --> 00:29:08.667
He unbutton his pants.

494
00:29:14.417 --> 00:29:15.375
I gagged.

495
00:29:18.458 --> 00:29:21.083
He said. if I threw up. he was
going to punch me in my face.

496
00:29:23.875 --> 00:29:25.417
So I swallowed my throw up.

497
00:29:28.041 --> 00:29:33.875
The next day. I saw
my social worker.

498
00:29:33.875 --> 00:29:35.166
And I told her to move me.

499
00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.583
I didn't tell her why.

500
00:29:41.583 --> 00:29:44.750
I don't want mama Lucille
to end up like mama Mabel.

501
00:29:50.083 --> 00:29:53.625
Can I have some water?

502
00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:54.125
Yeah.

503
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:13.125
Hon. I heard you on
the phone earlier.

504
00:30:13.125 --> 00:30:15.375
Is everything OK?

505
00:30:15.375 --> 00:30:16.583
Yes. babe.

506
00:30:16.583 --> 00:30:18.875
I mean. I hope so.

507
00:30:18.875 --> 00:30:23.834
My student. Tasha Cleaver. is
dealing with an unusual case.

508
00:30:23.834 --> 00:30:31.542
Allegedly. her patient was
abused and she went back

509
00:30:31.542 --> 00:30:36.500
and she killed everyone
who had hurt her.

510
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.083
Wow.

511
00:30:38.083 --> 00:30:41.375
That is an unusual case.

512
00:30:41.375 --> 00:30:42.917
But you gave your
students everything

513
00:30:42.917 --> 00:30:43.792
they need to succeed.

514
00:30:46.166 --> 00:30:46.667
Come here.

515
00:30:46.667 --> 00:30:47.291
Give me a kiss.

516
00:30:56.250 --> 00:31:00.000
He's four years old. I've been
feeding him for four years!

517
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
I want my goldfish please!

518
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.417
I want my goldfish.

519
00:31:12.417 --> 00:31:13.834
Did you see my goldfish?

520
00:31:18.375 --> 00:31:19.709
You leave me alone!

521
00:31:19.709 --> 00:31:21.458
Don't touch me!

522
00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:22.667
Mine.

523
00:31:22.667 --> 00:31:23.166
Mine.

524
00:31:25.709 --> 00:31:29.125
Hon. I understand your worry.

525
00:31:29.125 --> 00:31:31.000
It's normal.

526
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.208
But you prepared
your students well.

527
00:31:34.208 --> 00:31:35.750
Trust in God and in yourself.

528
00:31:53.041 --> 00:31:56.208
God bless me.

529
00:31:56.208 --> 00:31:58.208
God bless me.

530
00:31:58.208 --> 00:32:02.041
If God is for me. who
could be against me?

531
00:32:02.041 --> 00:32:05.083
if God is for me. who
could be against me?

532
00:32:11.041 --> 00:32:14.500
I was 16 years old.

533
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.667
My third foster parents.
Sean and Shana Harris.

534
00:32:18.667 --> 00:32:22.166
had a two-year-old.

535
00:32:22.166 --> 00:32:25.542
Sean was a real doctor.

536
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.917
Linda.

537
00:32:27.917 --> 00:32:28.792
What's up?

538
00:32:33.083 --> 00:32:34.458
Hey. baby.

539
00:32:34.458 --> 00:32:35.375
I'm on call this week.

540
00:32:35.375 --> 00:32:37.125
so I got to be.

541
00:32:37.125 --> 00:32:37.875
That's OK.

542
00:32:37.875 --> 00:32:38.375
All right.

543
00:32:38.375 --> 00:32:40.625
Oh. this is so good.

544
00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:41.208
See you later.

545
00:32:41.208 --> 00:32:42.375
See you later.

546
00:32:42.375 --> 00:32:43.208
Bye. sweety.

547
00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:52.375
So what are you
doing later. Linda?

548
00:32:52.375 --> 00:32:53.542
I'm going to a party.

549
00:32:53.542 --> 00:32:54.750
A party?

550
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:55.542
Yeah.

551
00:32:55.542 --> 00:32:56.959
That sounds like fun.

552
00:32:56.959 --> 00:32:58.750
What kind of party?

553
00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:59.917
Oh.

554
00:32:59.917 --> 00:33:01.959
Well my high school
friends would be there.

555
00:33:01.959 --> 00:33:02.875
Nice.

556
00:33:02.875 --> 00:33:04.458
Oh that sounds like a good time.

557
00:33:04.458 --> 00:33:07.458
How about. getting
your nails done later?

558
00:33:07.458 --> 00:33:08.667
Go down to Mimi's?

559
00:33:08.667 --> 00:33:09.542
Mimi's.

560
00:33:09.542 --> 00:33:10.834
I like Mimi's.

561
00:33:10.834 --> 00:33:11.333
Yeah.

562
00:33:11.333 --> 00:33:13.417
Yeah and treat us to
a massage while we're

563
00:33:13.417 --> 00:33:14.542
getting our nails done.

564
00:33:14.542 --> 00:33:15.041
Yeah.

565
00:33:15.041 --> 00:33:15.834
Wanna do that?

566
00:33:15.834 --> 00:33:16.333
Yeah.

567
00:33:16.333 --> 00:33:17.417
After dinner?

568
00:33:17.417 --> 00:33:18.959
OK.

569
00:33:18.959 --> 00:33:20.709
We'll go to Mimi's afterwards.

570
00:33:23.583 --> 00:33:26.000
I was starting to feel at home.

571
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.375
Like I belong somewhere.

572
00:33:30.542 --> 00:33:34.291
I went to a party with
my high school friends

573
00:33:34.291 --> 00:33:36.125
and we had a lot of fun.

574
00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:36.792
We were dancing.

575
00:33:39.458 --> 00:33:44.375
And this hot guy named Phil
told me to go upstairs with him.

576
00:33:44.375 --> 00:33:46.333
My friend said. I should go.

577
00:33:46.333 --> 00:33:47.583
All the girls want him.

578
00:33:51.166 --> 00:33:53.125
I went upstairs.

579
00:33:53.125 --> 00:33:58.500
I thought we were going to
talk and make out. and we did.

580
00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:03.792
We talked and then he kissed me.

581
00:34:03.792 --> 00:34:07.458
I felt like I was in heaven.

582
00:34:07.458 --> 00:34:11.625
I looked around his room
and two of his friends

583
00:34:11.625 --> 00:34:13.375
came out of the closet.

584
00:34:13.375 --> 00:34:16.250
I started screaming
and Phil smack me.

585
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:19.166
He told me to shut up.

586
00:34:19.166 --> 00:34:22.000
He looked at me
with watery eyes.

587
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.792
His friends held me down.

588
00:34:24.792 --> 00:34:26.000
They moved him out the way.

589
00:34:28.959 --> 00:34:31.208
They said. bitch you're going
to get what you deserve.

590
00:34:34.834 --> 00:34:42.041
One of them unbuttoned his
pants and jumped on me.

591
00:34:42.041 --> 00:34:43.458
I had no fight left in me.

592
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:49.750
The other one was drinking
a bottle of liquor.

593
00:34:52.792 --> 00:35:01.250
He poured it on top of me and
then he put the bottle in me.

594
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.959
I screamed.

595
00:35:05.583 --> 00:35:06.750
He punched me in my face.

596
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.458
Next thing you know. I
woke up in the hospital.

597
00:35:25.667 --> 00:35:29.333
My social worker was there
and my foster parents.

598
00:35:35.667 --> 00:35:38.750
I was raped time and time again.

599
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:39.834
They treated me like shit.

600
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:44.667
They made me suffer.
I should have

601
00:35:44.667 --> 00:35:47.041
made them suffer the
way they made me suffer.

602
00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:50.333
They took my soul.

603
00:35:50.333 --> 00:35:51.792
It was a matter of the heart.

604
00:35:56.667 --> 00:36:00.500
Linda. what did you do to
the people that hurt you?

605
00:36:03.375 --> 00:36:06.041
I killed them. but I
should have ate them alive.

606
00:36:20.542 --> 00:36:21.250
Hey babe.

607
00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.000
How's it going?

608
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.375
Yeah just checking up on you.

609
00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:26.417
How's your day?

610
00:36:26.417 --> 00:36:28.583
OK.

611
00:36:28.583 --> 00:36:29.542
Need anything?

612
00:36:32.875 --> 00:36:33.417
OK.

613
00:36:33.417 --> 00:36:34.083
Right away.

614
00:36:34.083 --> 00:36:34.917
I'm on it.

615
00:36:34.917 --> 00:36:37.208
I'll take care of it and
I'll give you a call back.

616
00:36:37.208 --> 00:36:38.125
Talk to you later.

617
00:36:53.333 --> 00:36:54.500
I'm hungry.

618
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.208
Where's my food?

619
00:36:56.208 --> 00:36:57.417
It should be here any minute.

620
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:02.250
Here's your food. Linda.

621
00:37:05.041 --> 00:37:06.333
I don't want that.

622
00:37:06.333 --> 00:37:09.500
Take it away.

623
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.208
Excuse me. Linda.

624
00:37:10.208 --> 00:37:11.917
Didn't you just say
that you were hungry?

625
00:37:14.417 --> 00:37:15.208
I don't want that.

626
00:37:15.208 --> 00:37:16.208
Take it away now.

627
00:37:19.458 --> 00:37:21.458
Thank you. John.

628
00:37:21.458 --> 00:37:23.125
We appreciate it.

629
00:37:23.125 --> 00:37:23.750
You're welcome.

630
00:37:37.959 --> 00:37:39.750
Where's Tasha?

631
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:41.917
Where's Tasha?

632
00:37:41.917 --> 00:37:43.333
She's right here.

633
00:37:43.333 --> 00:37:43.834
Tasha.

634
00:37:43.834 --> 00:37:45.709
I'm gonna get you some
water. be right back.

635
00:37:45.709 --> 00:37:46.709
Mom.

636
00:37:46.709 --> 00:37:48.709
What's wrong?

637
00:37:48.709 --> 00:37:51.709
Come here baby. sit down.

638
00:37:51.709 --> 00:37:55.166
Mom. what's wrong?

639
00:37:55.166 --> 00:37:56.458
Tasha.

640
00:37:56.458 --> 00:37:57.792
Mom. tell me what's wrong.

641
00:37:57.792 --> 00:37:59.875
I went to the doctors.

642
00:37:59.875 --> 00:38:03.625
He told me I have breast cancer.

643
00:38:03.625 --> 00:38:07.500
I have to go for
chemotherapy and surgery.

644
00:38:10.542 --> 00:38:12.542
I'm sorry. baby.

645
00:38:12.542 --> 00:38:13.291
Don't be sorry.

646
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:14.250
I'm sorry.

647
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.041
Don't be sorry.

648
00:38:16.041 --> 00:38:17.250
It's going to be OK--

649
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:17.875
I love you too.

650
00:38:17.875 --> 00:38:19.500
I'm sorry.

651
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.041
I'm sorry.

652
00:38:21.041 --> 00:38:23.500
I'm sorry.

653
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:27.166
Look at-- Look at me.

654
00:38:34.417 --> 00:38:35.458
Be strong baby.

655
00:38:35.458 --> 00:38:37.041
You're the strongest
lady I know.

656
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.750
Look at you.

657
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:23.417
What is this?

658
00:39:26.083 --> 00:39:27.583
What is this?

659
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.792
I need my blanket.

660
00:39:31.792 --> 00:39:33.500
Your sneakers are on backwards.

661
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.500
I need my diaper.

662
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.000
Your diaper.

663
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.500
Yes. you need your diaper.

664
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.208
Look at you.

665
00:39:40.583 --> 00:39:42.291
Look at this one.

666
00:39:42.291 --> 00:39:43.125
Fix your glasses.

667
00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:45.750
What is this?

668
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:48.875
Have a seat. have a seat.

669
00:39:48.875 --> 00:39:51.583
I want my goldfish back.

670
00:39:51.583 --> 00:39:53.625
Oh. is that you son.

671
00:39:53.625 --> 00:39:54.125
Mine.

672
00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:55.291
Is that your son?

673
00:39:55.291 --> 00:39:56.375
Is it yours?

674
00:39:56.375 --> 00:39:57.333
Mine.

675
00:39:57.333 --> 00:40:00.250
Sit back there.

676
00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.834
My mommy didn't see my goldfish.

677
00:40:02.834 --> 00:40:05.125
Did you see my
goldfish. anybody?

678
00:40:05.125 --> 00:40:05.792
Daddy?

679
00:40:05.792 --> 00:40:06.500
I'm not dad--

680
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.375
I thought I killed you.

681
00:40:08.375 --> 00:40:09.834
What are you doing here?

682
00:40:09.834 --> 00:40:11.041
I live here now.

683
00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:11.542
OK.

684
00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:12.041
I'll do it!

685
00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:12.959
I'll do it!

686
00:40:17.875 --> 00:40:18.792
Code red!

687
00:40:18.792 --> 00:40:19.792
Code red!

688
00:40:19.792 --> 00:40:20.291
Code red!

689
00:40:20.291 --> 00:40:22.500
All right. everybody stand back.

690
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.959
Oh my god. what's going on here?

691
00:40:47.166 --> 00:40:48.542
All right everyone.
just back up.

692
00:40:51.417 --> 00:40:52.709
They got her.

693
00:40:52.709 --> 00:40:54.125
They take her away.

694
00:40:56.709 --> 00:40:59.208
They take away.

695
00:40:59.208 --> 00:40:59.709
Go.

696
00:40:59.709 --> 00:41:00.500
Get out of here.

697
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.625
Stay where you at.

698
00:41:16.542 --> 00:41:17.667
Oh my God.

699
00:41:17.667 --> 00:41:19.834
Another one of her
crazy episodes?

700
00:41:19.834 --> 00:41:22.166
Well it hasn't happened
about a month and a half.

701
00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:23.083
That's very good.

702
00:41:23.083 --> 00:41:23.625
Yeah. I know.

703
00:41:23.625 --> 00:41:25.542
But this is like every week.

704
00:41:25.542 --> 00:41:27.875
I can't work no more. I'm
tired of these crazy people.

705
00:41:27.875 --> 00:41:30.041
Only reason why I work
here. I got to pay my bills.

706
00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:30.750
Stop that.

707
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:31.250
Bills?

708
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:33.667
Yeah. I gotta pay my cable bill.

709
00:41:33.667 --> 00:41:36.583
I live with my mama.

710
00:41:36.583 --> 00:41:38.458
--and lollipops.

711
00:41:38.458 --> 00:41:39.041
Cut it out.

712
00:41:39.417 --> 00:41:40.667
Tears to shed.

713
00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:44.375
It has too much anger in veins.

714
00:41:44.375 --> 00:41:48.083
It will have to
face to many ordeals

715
00:41:48.083 --> 00:41:51.458
and there are so many
good things to change.

716
00:41:51.458 --> 00:41:58.917
But in this world why does
it rain such selfishness.

717
00:41:58.917 --> 00:42:03.417
Said I'm wondering every day.

718
00:42:03.417 --> 00:42:06.542
Every day.

719
00:42:06.542 --> 00:42:12.667
Said I'm wondering
every day. every day.

720
00:42:12.667 --> 00:42:15.625
What's going on?

721
00:42:15.625 --> 00:42:19.458
I'm looking outside my window.

722
00:42:19.458 --> 00:42:23.125
The rain can't stop falling.

723
00:42:23.125 --> 00:42:30.000
Reaching our veins. destroying
our praise. giving us pain.

724
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Hate driblets us
through the darkness.

725
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.458
All we know is
sadness and madness.

726
00:42:37.458 --> 00:42:42.125
Father. help us to find a
way. 'cause  it's

727
00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:44.667
.

728
00:42:44.667 --> 00:42:52.041
Said I'm wondering every
day. every day. every day.

729
00:42:52.041 --> 00:42:58.333
I said I'm wondering every
day. every day. every day.

730
00:42:58.333 --> 00:43:00.208
What's going on?

731
00:43:00.208 --> 00:43:03.667
What's going on?

732
00:43:03.667 --> 00:43:05.667
Hi. Linda.

733
00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:08.875
Can you scratch my nose?

734
00:43:08.875 --> 00:43:11.125
Should I call your nurse?

735
00:43:11.125 --> 00:43:11.750
Come on.

736
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.041
By the time she called
you made me suffer.

737
00:43:14.041 --> 00:43:15.375
Can you scratch my nose. please?

738
00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:25.542
Better?

739
00:43:25.542 --> 00:43:28.291
Yes.

740
00:43:28.291 --> 00:43:30.709
Are you ready?

741
00:43:30.709 --> 00:43:31.208
Yes.

742
00:43:35.417 --> 00:43:37.083
Can you tell me how
the killing started?

743
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.917
Got out of the hospital.

744
00:43:46.917 --> 00:43:50.250
I went to the halfway house.

745
00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.417
I lived there for two weeks.

746
00:43:53.417 --> 00:43:58.667
I just got out to use the
bathroom and to eat a little.

747
00:43:58.667 --> 00:44:02.250
On Monday morning I got up
and went to the library.

748
00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:04.417
The rules were.
if you go to work.

749
00:44:04.417 --> 00:44:07.709
school. or family
visits you can leave.

750
00:44:07.709 --> 00:44:09.875
But we had a curfew.

751
00:44:09.875 --> 00:44:11.583
I had to be back by 7:00 PM.

752
00:44:15.875 --> 00:44:20.041
So I sat in front
of the computer.

753
00:44:20.041 --> 00:44:22.417
and I put in the name of
my first foster parents.

754
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.542
Mabel when Charlie
Anderson from New Jersey.

755
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:32.834
I called them up.

756
00:44:35.667 --> 00:44:37.792
He picked up the phone.

757
00:44:37.792 --> 00:44:40.792
And I say Hi. I'm Mary Grant.

758
00:44:40.792 --> 00:44:44.000
Mabel's long lost cousin.

759
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.875
He was shock.

760
00:44:46.875 --> 00:44:48.625
Nevertheless. happy
to hear from me.

761
00:44:51.208 --> 00:44:52.959
He said. that when
Mabel passed away.

762
00:44:52.959 --> 00:44:55.000
it happened so sudden.
that he didn't have time

763
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.208
to contact all her family.

764
00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.125
We talked a little.

765
00:45:03.125 --> 00:45:04.792
And I asked him if
I could come over.

766
00:45:07.667 --> 00:45:10.250
He asked me a few questions
and then gave me the address.

767
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:20.667
Hi. my name's Marie.

768
00:45:20.667 --> 00:45:22.333
Marie. my wife's cousin.

769
00:45:22.333 --> 00:45:23.417
Please. come in.

770
00:45:28.583 --> 00:45:31.417
Would you like some coffee. tea?

771
00:45:31.417 --> 00:45:32.250
Water would be fine.

772
00:45:48.375 --> 00:45:50.125
What would you like
to know about my wife?

773
00:45:55.291 --> 00:45:59.834
She was a beautiful
and loving woman.

774
00:45:59.834 --> 00:46:02.959
And really didn't deserve.

775
00:46:02.959 --> 00:46:04.166
What happened to her?

776
00:46:07.166 --> 00:46:09.625
We had a foster child.

777
00:46:09.625 --> 00:46:15.625
And something happened one
day and she was taken away.

778
00:46:15.625 --> 00:46:17.917
I opened my bag and I took
the knife out and wrapped it

779
00:46:17.917 --> 00:46:18.834
around his throat.

780
00:46:22.458 --> 00:46:25.291
I said. open up to
Exodus 20:12. read it.

781
00:46:28.125 --> 00:46:30.917
I'm that foster child mother--

782
00:46:30.917 --> 00:46:34.250
He fell right on
top of his Bible.

783
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:36.667
I looked at him.

784
00:46:36.667 --> 00:46:37.875
He bled to death.

785
00:46:46.583 --> 00:46:50.875
I went to the kitchen and
I-- and I washed my knife.

786
00:46:50.875 --> 00:46:53.375
I came back and I prayed.

787
00:46:55.917 --> 00:47:02.166
I put my knife from my
bag and I went back.

788
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:06.125
That night. I slept like a baby.

789
00:47:08.917 --> 00:47:10.792
The next morning. I went
back to the library.

790
00:47:15.875 --> 00:47:19.166
I sat in front of the
computer and I took out

791
00:47:19.166 --> 00:47:21.417
a piece of paper.

792
00:47:21.417 --> 00:47:24.208
I crossed out the name of
my first foster parents.

793
00:47:27.458 --> 00:47:29.625
And I put in the name of
my second foster parents.

794
00:47:33.583 --> 00:47:39.375
Lucille and James Lander
from North New Jersey.

795
00:47:39.375 --> 00:47:42.250
Couple of seals and
James Lander came up.

796
00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:47.250
Montclair New Jersey. Nutley
New Jersey. Forrest Hill.

797
00:47:50.166 --> 00:47:51.792
But only one in
North New Jersey.

798
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:55.709
I called them up.

799
00:47:58.458 --> 00:48:02.125
She was a school teacher now.

800
00:48:02.125 --> 00:48:06.542
She picked up the phone
in the second ring.

801
00:48:06.542 --> 00:48:10.166
I say Hi. I'm Mary Grant
and I work for the city.

802
00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:12.208
And I want to go over this
so you can do a survey

803
00:48:12.208 --> 00:48:13.250
to make the city better.

804
00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:18.834
She said. when can you come.

805
00:48:18.834 --> 00:48:22.250
I said. tomorrow at 12:00 noon.

806
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:24.709
She said. I won't be
home. but my husband James

807
00:48:24.709 --> 00:48:25.750
can fill it out for you.

808
00:48:28.875 --> 00:48:30.834
I said. OK.

809
00:48:30.834 --> 00:48:31.834
She gave me the address.

810
00:48:34.333 --> 00:48:36.041
And the next day I
woke up in the morning

811
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:37.083
and I went over there.

812
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:42.375
Just a minute.

813
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.834
Yeah.

814
00:48:48.834 --> 00:48:50.792
Hi. my name is Mary and
I'm here to do a survey

815
00:48:50.792 --> 00:48:51.834
to make the city better.

816
00:48:51.834 --> 00:48:53.250
Yeah. my wife's not here.

817
00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:54.583
OK--

818
00:48:54.583 --> 00:48:55.208
Hey!

819
00:48:55.208 --> 00:48:57.250
Your wife said that you
will fill it out for me.

820
00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:58.375
Oh Jesus.

821
00:48:58.375 --> 00:49:00.583
Come on.

822
00:49:00.583 --> 00:49:02.166
It's not going to
take all day. is it?

823
00:49:02.166 --> 00:49:05.583
She always makes me
freaking do this.

824
00:49:05.583 --> 00:49:06.291
Have a seat over.

825
00:49:12.083 --> 00:49:14.083
What is this survey
about exactly?

826
00:49:14.083 --> 00:49:16.792
Well. it's to make
the city better.

827
00:49:16.792 --> 00:49:18.250
City is shit anyway.

828
00:49:23.417 --> 00:49:25.083
I'm not giving my date of birth.

829
00:49:25.083 --> 00:49:26.041
You don't need to know.

830
00:49:28.834 --> 00:49:31.917
I'm not giving my social. are
you're freaking kidding me?

831
00:49:31.917 --> 00:49:35.000
Are you kidding me?

832
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.458
It's just to make
the city better.

833
00:49:36.458 --> 00:49:38.291
How long-- how
many pages is this?

834
00:49:38.291 --> 00:49:38.917
It's a couple.

835
00:49:38.917 --> 00:49:40.041
A couple thousand.

836
00:49:42.583 --> 00:49:44.041
This is already filled out.

837
00:49:44.041 --> 00:49:48.792
What are you one of
these 999 in ??

838
00:49:48.792 --> 00:49:49.291
Sorry.

839
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.959
Hey. sweet cheeks. it's
already filled out.

840
00:49:58.959 --> 00:49:59.959
There you go.

841
00:49:59.959 --> 00:50:01.667
And this says please
do not retain.

842
00:50:04.792 --> 00:50:07.709
Do they give you
commission or what?

843
00:50:07.709 --> 00:50:08.500
You good?

844
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:09.750
You want coffee or something?

845
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:11.250
Thank you.

846
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:13.417
Coffee would be nice.

847
00:50:13.417 --> 00:50:15.709
Oh. you know what they
do need to do over there.

848
00:50:15.709 --> 00:50:17.542
And I noticed that
they didn't put it in.

849
00:50:17.542 --> 00:50:20.000
and they probably didn't
put it in on purpose--

850
00:50:22.792 --> 00:50:24.667
--You know how I know?

851
00:50:24.667 --> 00:50:27.250
Because I started one day--

852
00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:29.250
.

853
00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:32.750
I don't know if that's
the right way you say it.

854
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:35.333
And the water was kind of funny
so I went and bought a burrito

855
00:50:35.333 --> 00:50:37.959
but I was like why should
I be the one to have to--

856
00:50:44.417 --> 00:50:46.250
I looked at him.

857
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:47.792
He choked on throw up.

858
00:50:51.792 --> 00:50:54.625
I cleaned my knife out.

859
00:50:54.625 --> 00:50:58.583
I put it in my bag and I left.

860
00:51:03.583 --> 00:51:05.500
Linda. how did you
feel afterwards?

861
00:51:09.542 --> 00:51:13.125
I was happy I made him suffer.

862
00:51:13.125 --> 00:51:14.500
But then I didn't feel anything.

863
00:51:18.792 --> 00:51:21.458
Boy. I'm hungry.

864
00:51:21.458 --> 00:51:23.291
Dinner should be here soon.

865
00:51:23.291 --> 00:51:24.417
Good.

866
00:51:24.417 --> 00:51:25.875
All this talk has
made me hungry.

867
00:51:30.792 --> 00:51:32.000
Here's your food. Linda.

868
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.375
Nurse.

869
00:51:38.375 --> 00:51:40.125
Nurse.

870
00:51:40.125 --> 00:51:41.750
Yes?

871
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:44.250
Can we take these off?

872
00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:45.500
I'm hungry. I want to eat.

873
00:52:02.417 --> 00:52:04.375
Linda. slow down.

874
00:52:04.375 --> 00:52:05.458
I don't want you to choke.

875
00:52:07.875 --> 00:52:08.375
Choke.

876
00:52:13.792 --> 00:52:15.333
Fine.

877
00:52:15.333 --> 00:52:16.875
Get some rest. I'll
see you tomorrow.

878
00:52:33.041 --> 00:52:34.375
You try to lock me up?

879
00:52:43.125 --> 00:52:44.166
What are you doing?

880
00:52:44.166 --> 00:52:45.125
Stop. no.

881
00:52:45.125 --> 00:52:48.500
Stop-- Stop.

882
00:52:56.041 --> 00:52:57.959
Good morning. Linda.

883
00:52:57.959 --> 00:53:00.583
What's so good about it?

884
00:53:00.583 --> 00:53:03.417
Well. you woke up this morning.

885
00:53:03.417 --> 00:53:04.291
I must be special.

886
00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:08.208
Let's get started.

887
00:53:11.208 --> 00:53:13.250
Miss Cleaver?

888
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:16.208
Please call me Tasha.

889
00:53:16.208 --> 00:53:22.583
When we finish this session. can
I talk to you about something?

890
00:53:22.583 --> 00:53:23.834
Sure. anything.

891
00:53:30.542 --> 00:53:34.125
I woke up that
morning and I already

892
00:53:34.125 --> 00:53:36.625
had a number to my
third foster family.

893
00:53:36.625 --> 00:53:40.166
because we kept in contact.

894
00:53:40.166 --> 00:53:44.125
This morning. however. I
went back to the school

895
00:53:44.125 --> 00:53:47.625
where the boys went
to who rape me.

896
00:53:47.625 --> 00:53:51.041
It was two years later.

897
00:53:51.041 --> 00:53:54.959
So I disguised myself
the best way I could.

898
00:53:54.959 --> 00:53:55.667
I waited.

899
00:53:58.709 --> 00:54:02.417
I was in the side of the
school and school let out.

900
00:54:02.417 --> 00:54:03.458
And I didn't see them.

901
00:54:06.458 --> 00:54:07.333
So I waited.

902
00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:14.166
I walked to the
back of the school.

903
00:54:14.166 --> 00:54:17.959
and I heard a girl screaming.
so I started running.

904
00:54:17.959 --> 00:54:23.875
I ran over there and two boys
were practically harassing her.

905
00:54:23.875 --> 00:54:29.333
I looked at them.
and there they were.

906
00:54:29.333 --> 00:54:33.417
One of them said to me. what
the fuck are you going to do.

907
00:54:33.417 --> 00:54:34.542
I told the girl to run.

908
00:54:38.542 --> 00:54:41.583
I went in my bag
and took out a gun.

909
00:54:41.583 --> 00:54:42.417
I shot them.

910
00:54:45.083 --> 00:54:47.417
The other one was
shaking his head no.

911
00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:51.083
And I shot him three times.

912
00:54:51.083 --> 00:54:53.333
Third guy was running
up and when he--

913
00:54:53.333 --> 00:54:56.750
he saw me. he froze.

914
00:54:56.750 --> 00:55:00.000
I pointed the gun to his face.

915
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.542
I walked up to him.

916
00:55:03.542 --> 00:55:05.875
I said. take off your pants.

917
00:55:05.875 --> 00:55:07.000
I shot them in the stomach.

918
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:13.000
Started taking off his pants.

919
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.208
Shot him in the knees.

920
00:55:17.291 --> 00:55:21.750
Then I went in my bag.
and I took out a bottle.

921
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:24.125
and I stuck it inside of him.

922
00:55:24.125 --> 00:55:25.375
He was screaming.

923
00:55:30.375 --> 00:55:34.417
I let him scream a little.
then I shot him in the head.

924
00:55:38.166 --> 00:55:40.583
Then I went to my third
foster family's house.

925
00:55:43.291 --> 00:55:44.792
I was there for a little while.

926
00:55:50.792 --> 00:55:52.208
Who is it?

927
00:55:52.208 --> 00:55:52.709
Linda.

928
00:55:57.291 --> 00:55:57.792
Linda.

929
00:56:03.959 --> 00:56:05.417
Can I go to the bathroom?

930
00:56:05.417 --> 00:56:09.333
Of course. you know about that.

931
00:56:09.333 --> 00:56:11.083
Would you like some tea?

932
00:57:04.709 --> 00:57:05.875
So how are you doing. Linda?

933
00:57:10.333 --> 00:57:15.709
Mama Harris. I took care of
everyone who ever hurt me.

934
00:57:15.709 --> 00:57:19.250
Baby. what do you mean
you took care of them?

935
00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:22.834
I killed them.

936
00:57:26.834 --> 00:57:27.792
Who is it?

937
00:57:27.792 --> 00:57:29.000
Police officers.

938
00:57:31.792 --> 00:57:33.208
How can I help you?

939
00:57:33.208 --> 00:57:34.667
Is Linda Blake there?

940
00:57:34.667 --> 00:57:35.208
Why?

941
00:57:35.208 --> 00:57:37.375
Linda allegedly
killed a few people.

942
00:57:37.375 --> 00:57:39.166
And if you're
protecting her. you'll

943
00:57:39.166 --> 00:57:40.834
be arrested for
harboring a fugitive.

944
00:57:40.834 --> 00:57:42.041
Now open the door.

945
00:57:55.834 --> 00:57:56.834
Linda Blake. stand.

946
00:58:00.333 --> 00:58:03.000
You're under arrest.

947
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.583
You have the right
to remain silent.

948
00:58:05.583 --> 00:58:08.667
Anything you say will
be held against you.

949
00:58:08.667 --> 00:58:10.834
You have the right to
speak to an attorney.

950
00:58:10.834 --> 00:58:15.000
If you can't afford one. one
will be appointed ..

951
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.208
You understand your rights?

952
00:58:37.458 --> 00:58:39.166
You took matters
into your own hands.

953
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:44.667
I protected myself
better than you.

954
00:58:44.667 --> 00:58:47.291
the law. or the foster
system could protect me.

955
00:58:54.375 --> 00:58:56.458
Linda. what else did you
want to talk to me about?

956
00:59:00.291 --> 00:59:01.375
I had a little girl.

957
00:59:04.625 --> 00:59:12.834
At the age of 16. after my
third rape. I was left for dead.

958
00:59:12.834 --> 00:59:16.917
so they took her away
from me - the system.

959
00:59:16.917 --> 00:59:17.959
I wanted to see my baby.

960
00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:24.875
Linda. how old are you now?

961
00:59:24.875 --> 00:59:28.250
I don't know. you have my chart.

962
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:31.375
Linda. if you want my help.
you have to cooperate with me.

963
00:59:37.125 --> 00:59:43.667
When they took my baby from
me. I felt empty inside.

964
00:59:43.667 --> 00:59:48.083
I fought to live
because I believe

965
00:59:48.083 --> 00:59:49.500
one day I will see her again.

966
00:59:53.542 --> 00:59:55.458
I want to see my baby.

967
00:59:55.458 --> 00:59:56.709
I want to see my little girl.

968
01:00:00.709 --> 01:00:01.583
I'll try to help.

969
01:00:07.542 --> 01:00:10.667
Anne. go check the
patient in room four.

970
01:00:10.667 --> 01:00:12.667
OK.

971
01:00:12.667 --> 01:00:16.667
Norman. check the file on
page number five. Mr Avery.

972
01:00:16.667 --> 01:00:19.083
I want to know the last
time he took his medication.

973
01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:19.583
OK.

974
01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:20.333
I'll give that to.

975
01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:33.417
Tasha. there's
something that what

976
01:00:33.417 --> 01:00:34.625
we have to talk to you about.

977
01:00:34.625 --> 01:00:35.792
It's really important.

978
01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:42.125
I wasn't able to have children.
so we seeked adoption.

979
01:00:45.458 --> 01:00:51.291
And the reason why Linda Blake
sounded so very familiar.

980
01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:52.792
she's your biological mother.

981
01:01:00.917 --> 01:01:01.417
What?

982
01:01:08.125 --> 01:01:10.834
Wow.

983
01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:13.417
What took you so
long to tell me?

984
01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:16.500
I don't know why.
baby. I'm sorry.

985
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.041
I thought it was
all right. baby.

986
01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:37.458
OK.

987
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:54.792
Good morning.

988
01:01:54.792 --> 01:01:56.500
Good morning.

994
01:02:23.291 --> 01:02:25.500

It's a lot.

999
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.250

didn't tell you sooner.

1000
01:03:40.834 --> 01:03:44.291

1007
01:04:13.375 --> 01:04:15.083
How can I help you?

1008
01:04:15.083 --> 01:04:16.333

1019
01:05:00.041 --> 01:05:01.375
Excuse me.

The hardest one. for sure.

1043
01:06:25.083 --> 01:06:27.917
But what are you
going to do from here?

1044

I'm mad hungry. I could a horse.

1047
01:06:32.208 --> 01:06:33.875
Can you really
eat a whole horse?

1048
01:06:33.875 --> 01:06:34.959
Yes.

1049
01:06:34.959 --> 01:06:37.417

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.959
It's good to see you again.

1099
01:10:24.959 --> 01:10:26.000
Yes.

1100
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.709
Look what she made for us.

1101
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:29.625
I got this for you
and my daughter.

1102
01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:30.917
Oh. thank you.

1103
01:10:30.917 --> 01:10:31.792
This is beautiful.

1104
01:10:31.792 --> 01:10:34.083
You're welcome.

1105
01:10:34.083 --> 01:10:35.750
Hey babe. you want
to it to the kitchen?

1106
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:37.500
Yeah.

1107
01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.500
Tristan. show grandma
to her room. OK.

1108
01:11:21.041 --> 01:11:22.417
So?

1109
01:11:22.417 --> 01:11:23.125
So.

1110
01:11:23.125 --> 01:11:23.792
How you feeling?

1111
01:11:26.625 --> 01:11:28.208
I can't believe she's here.

1112
01:11:28.208 --> 01:11:29.000
I know.

1113
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.458
10 years later.

1114
01:11:30.458 --> 01:11:33.208
10 years.

1115
01:11:33.208 --> 01:11:36.542
I've dreamed of
living with my mom.

1116
01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:37.917
But you deserve it. babe.

1117
01:11:37.917 --> 01:11:39.583
We deserve it.

1118
01:11:39.583 --> 01:11:40.542
You're right. we do.

1119
01:11:55.083 --> 01:11:58.709
Hey. did you grab anything
to eat on your way in?

1120
01:11:58.709 --> 01:12:00.291
Guess what I made.

1121
01:12:00.291 --> 01:12:01.166
What'd you make?

1122
01:12:01.166 --> 01:12:03.000
Pancakes.

1123
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.208
My favorite!

1124
01:12:04.208 --> 01:12:06.625
I know.

1125
01:12:06.625 --> 01:12:08.417
You know. we're going
to have to watch over

1126
01:12:08.417 --> 01:12:10.166
this crazy kid of ours.

1127
01:12:10.166 --> 01:12:11.208
I know.

1128
01:12:11.208 --> 01:12:11.875
Where's he at?

1129
01:12:29.875 --> 01:12:31.500
Tristan.

1130
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.333
I don't hear him.

1131
01:12:34.333 --> 01:12:35.750
Tristan.

1132
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:36.917
It's OK. babe.

1133
01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:39.166
He's with his grandma.

1134
01:12:39.166 --> 01:12:42.083
I know. but I want to
see what they're up to.

1135
01:12:42.083 --> 01:12:42.583
All right.

1136
01:13:21.375 --> 01:13:23.917
Dear mommy. I was only a kid.

1137
01:13:23.917 --> 01:13:27.000
Even to this day. I
don't know what I did.

1138
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.750
For you to not hug me no more.

1139
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:33.000
For you to not love me no more.

1140
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.834
So I went to the
arms of strangers.

1141
01:13:34.834 --> 01:13:38.583
Never thought for once you will
put me at home ..

1142
01:13:38.583 --> 01:13:40.583
So you left me alone.

1143
01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:44.083
What made you think I
can do this on my own?

1144
01:13:44.083 --> 01:13:46.166
It's this the results
that you needed?

1145
01:13:46.166 --> 01:13:49.709
I got the message. but I
was too young to read it.

1146
01:13:49.709 --> 01:13:52.792
I hate that book that was
written. if there's a God.

1147
01:13:52.792 --> 01:13:55.500
why wasn't I forgiven?

1148
01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.458
Mommy. why'd you
let them hurt me?

1149
01:13:58.458 --> 01:14:00.875
And why did you desert me?

1150
01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:03.041
Maybe it's a test I
had to live through.

1151
01:14:03.041 --> 01:14:04.834
but it's right to come home.

1152
01:14:04.834 --> 01:14:07.250
It's all right. it's OK.

1153
01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:10.083
Everything you did I forgave.

1154
01:14:10.083 --> 01:14:13.208
You know I always loved
you from the side.

1155
01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:14.166
Just be strong.

1156
01:14:14.166 --> 01:14:16.083
Just the matters of the heart.

1157
01:14:16.083 --> 01:14:18.792
It's all right. it's OK.

1158
01:14:18.792 --> 01:14:21.291
Everything you did. I forgave.

1159
01:14:21.291 --> 01:14:24.291
When we've been apart.
lives has taught me.

1160
01:14:24.291 --> 01:14:28.000
that one thing remains.

1161
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.583
Dear Daddy. it's all my
fault. It's the way I dress.

1162
01:14:31.583 --> 01:14:33.625
no. it's the way I walk. no.

1163
01:14:33.625 --> 01:14:36.250
The way I talk. I
was leading them on.

1164
01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:39.166
Maybe I deserved this
and Eden is wrong.

1165
01:14:39.166 --> 01:14:41.792
I'll do whatever if you
just come and get me.

1166
01:14:41.792 --> 01:14:45.500
Lord knows I prayed but my
angels just aren't with me.

1167
01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:50.959
--let this happen to me. so
why is this happening to me.

1168
01:14:50.959 --> 01:14:56.625
I wasn't old enough to send.
but I was told when I was 10.

1169
01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:58.542
if I'm lucky to
see you tomorrow.

1170
01:14:58.542 --> 01:15:00.917
I could take this sorrow
start all over again.

1171
01:15:00.917 --> 01:15:03.834
So they ain't deserve
it. but I guess I did.

1172
01:15:03.834 --> 01:15:07.834
Like. really ain't fair. so was
it fair that I left my family.

1173
01:15:07.834 --> 01:15:11.625
Was just shattered apart
into pieces spelled out.

1174
01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:12.959
It's all right.

1175
01:15:12.959 --> 01:15:14.208
It's OK.

1176
01:15:14.208 --> 01:15:16.917
Everything you did. I forgave.

1177
01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:21.041
You know I always loved you
from the start. just be strong.

1178
01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:23.375
Just the matters of the heart.

1179
01:15:23.375 --> 01:15:25.667
It's all right. it's OK.

1180
01:15:25.667 --> 01:15:28.166
Everything you did. I forgave.

1181
01:15:28.166 --> 01:15:31.333
Though we fell apart.
life has taught me.

1182
01:15:31.333 --> 01:15:32.542
that one thing remains.

1183
01:15:32.542 --> 01:15:34.500
Just the matters of the heart.

1184
01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:40.291
Sometimes it's
hard to

1185
01:15:40.291 --> 01:15:45.500
from the things of your past.

1186
01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:51.083
But I've learned to let go.

1187
01:15:51.083 --> 01:15:56.291
Cause that's what the
heart needs to learn.

1188
01:15:56.291 --> 01:15:59.166
It's all right. it's OK.

1189
01:15:59.166 --> 01:16:01.625
Everything you did. I forgave.

1190
01:16:01.625 --> 01:16:04.500
You know I always loved
you from the start.

1191
01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:05.959
Just be strong.

1192
01:16:05.959 --> 01:16:07.417
Just the matters of the heart.

1193
01:16:07.417 --> 01:16:12.917
It's all right. it's OK.
everything you did. I forgave.

1194
01:16:12.917 --> 01:16:15.667
Though we fell apart.
life has taught me

1195
01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:17.166
that one thing remains.

1196
01:16:17.166 --> 01:16:19.166
Just the matters of the heart.

1197
01:16:29.125 --> 01:16:30.083
Yeah. yeah.

1198
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.417
Wait a minute now. I
shouldn't be afraid.

1199
01:16:41.417 --> 01:16:47.208
With this parachute of love.
I shouldn't be scared to fly.

1200
01:16:47.208 --> 01:16:50.750
The funny thing is. that
this hurricane in my tummy.

1201
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:53.959
ain't that a sign.

1202
01:16:53.959 --> 01:16:56.041
Won't you fade them away.

1203
01:16:56.041 --> 01:16:59.709
---- moment
for the cloud that's filled

1204
01:16:59.709 --> 01:17:02.625
with symbols of grace.

1205
01:17:02.625 --> 01:17:07.583
Every drop of grey is on the
line with silver pieces love

1206
01:17:07.583 --> 01:17:09.125
you trade.

1207
01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:13.667
Every time I spill upon
yourself a shield of lining

1208
01:17:13.667 --> 01:17:16.000
start to break.

1209
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:22.250
Through it all. when I fall and
when I fall. I fall like rain.

1210
01:17:26.083 --> 01:17:28.041
When I fall. I fall like rain.

1211
01:17:44.875 --> 01:17:50.667
If the day would come.
when you would be mine.

1212
01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:56.000
That's the day the cloud of grey
would turn into a cloud nine.

1213
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:02.917
Nine lives of your love
would pour a vase of time

1214
01:18:02.917 --> 01:18:04.000
.

1215
01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:18.000
Every drop of grey is underlined
with silver pieces of a tray.

1216
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.542
Every time I spill up on
yourself a shield of lining

1217
01:18:22.542 --> 01:18:25.458
starts to break.

1218
01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:28.291
Through it all. is
went I fall. and when

1219
01:18:28.291 --> 01:18:30.750
I fall. I fall like rain.

1220
01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:35.166
Your love trickles through--

1221
01:18:35.166 --> 01:18:40.000
your love trickles
through my veins.

1222
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.709
Your loves trickles through--

1223
01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:46.083
your love trickles
through my veins.

1224
01:18:46.083 --> 01:18:48.000
Your love trickles through.

1225
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.500
Your love trickles through.

1226
01:18:53.875 --> 01:18:57.291
Every little moment
forms a cloud that's

1227
01:18:57.291 --> 01:19:00.792
filled with syllables of grace.

1228
01:19:00.792 --> 01:19:04.959
Every drop of grey is
underlined with silver pieces

1229
01:19:04.959 --> 01:19:07.000
of your tray.

1230
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.083
Every time I spill upon
yourself. a shield of lining

1231
01:19:12.083 --> 01:19:13.834
turns to rain.

1232
01:19:17.458 --> 01:19:20.250
And when I fall.
I fall like rain.

1233
01:19:24.208 --> 01:19:26.166
When I fall. I fall like rain.

1234
01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:32.625
When I fall. I fall like rain.

1235
01:19:37.083 --> 01:19:39.041
When I fall. I fall like rain.

1236
01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:17.166
Mommy. i don't know what I did.

1237
01:20:17.166 --> 01:20:19.792
Hug me no more.

1238
01:20:19.792 --> 01:20:21.375
Love me no more.

1239
01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:31.000
Left me a alone.

1240
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.083
Was all on my own.

1241
01:20:36.834 --> 01:20:40.500
Too young to read.

1242
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.583
Oh.

1243
01:20:42.583 --> 01:20:45.291
I'm forgiven.

1244
01:20:45.291 --> 01:20:47.792
Hurt me.

1245
01:20:47.792 --> 01:20:49.041
Why did you desert me?

1246
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.834
It's all right. It's OK.

1247
01:20:56.834 --> 01:20:58.917
Everything you did. I forgave.

1248
01:20:58.917 --> 01:21:02.375
You know I always loved
you from the start.

1249
01:21:02.375 --> 01:21:03.375
Just be strong.

1250
01:21:03.375 --> 01:21:05.667
Just the matters of the heart.

1251
01:21:05.667 --> 01:21:06.291
It's all right.

1252
01:21:06.291 --> 01:21:08.000
It's OK.

1253
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.583
Everything you did. I forgave.

1254
01:21:10.583 --> 01:21:14.875
Though we fell apart. life has
taught me. one thing remains.

1255
01:21:14.875 --> 01:21:17.250
Just the matters of the heart.

1256
01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:22.667
Dear Daddy. it's
all my fault. No.

1257
01:21:34.417 --> 01:21:35.583
Are you with me?

1258
01:21:35.583 --> 01:21:36.500
Are you with me?

1259
01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:45.583
I was told this.

1260
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.667
So.

1261
01:21:51.667 --> 01:21:52.625
But I guess I didn't.

1262
01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:03.458
It's all right. it's OK.

1263
01:22:03.458 --> 01:22:06.375
Everything you did. I forgave.

1264
01:22:06.375 --> 01:22:09.291
You know I always loved
you. from the start.

1265
01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:10.542
Just be strong.

1266
01:22:10.542 --> 01:22:12.458
Just the matters of the heart.

1267
01:22:12.458 --> 01:22:14.458
It's all right. it's OK.

1268
01:22:14.458 --> 01:22:17.458
Everything you did. I forgave.

1269
01:22:17.458 --> 01:22:20.875
Though we fell apart.
life has taught me.

1270
01:22:20.875 --> 01:22:22.083
that one thing remains.

1271
01:22:22.083 --> 01:22:24.542
Just the matters of the heart.

1272
01:22:24.542 --> 01:22:35.000
Sometimes it's hard to will
from the things of your past.

1273
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.208
But I've learned to let go.

1274
01:22:40.208 --> 01:22:45.500
Cause that's what the
heart needs to learn.

1275
01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:48.375
It's all right. It's OK.

1276
01:22:48.375 --> 01:22:50.959
Everything you did. I forgave.

1277
01:22:50.959 --> 01:22:53.875
You know I always loved
you from the start.

1278
01:22:53.875 --> 01:22:55.125
Just be strong.

1279
01:22:55.125 --> 01:22:57.333
Just the matters of the heart.

1280
01:22:57.333 --> 01:22:59.166
It's all right. it's OK.

1281
01:22:59.166 --> 01:23:02.083
Everything you did. I forgave.

1282
01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:05.041
Though we fell apart
life has taught me.

1283
01:23:05.041 --> 01:23:09.792
that one thing remains. just
the matters of the heart.
