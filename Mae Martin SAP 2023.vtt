00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:14.764
[fire crackling]

4
00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.810
[pensive instrumental music playing]

5
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:33.616
[gasps] Oh!

6
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.286
-Jesus! Mamma mia. Mae! Jeez!
-Hey. Sorry.

7
00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:37.829
[sighs]

8
00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.622
-Marshmallow?
-Uh… No. I'm good.

9
00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.292
-Rubber band?
-Sure. I'll take one.

10
00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.793
-All right.
-Thanks.

11
00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:50.008
[laughing] Oh!

12
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.010
Story time.

13
00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:54.012
-Nice. Well. I'll settle in.
-Okay.

14
00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:55.513
Um…

15
00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:03.271
[sighs]

16
00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.440
Mae. I just got mine replaced.

17
00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.236
[kisses]

18
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.279
[kisses]

19
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:15.658
Hope you backed up the pictures
from your wedding.

20
00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.327
[sighs]

21
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.454
-Um. can you introduce me?
-Okay. [clears throat]

22
00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.332
-Can you do the "And now" one?
-The "And now"? Okay. got it.

23
00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:23.541
Thank you.

24
00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:29.214
And now. please put your hands together.

25
00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:32.342
and welcome to the stage.

26
00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:35.178
the one. the only.

27
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.890
Mae Martin!

28
00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.976
[crowd cheering]

29
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:49.526
Hi!

30
00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.361
[crowd continues cheering]

31
00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:54.614
How we doing?

32
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:00.912
[chuckling] Hey.

33
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:03.748
Hi.

34
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.876
Nice to see you.

35
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.214
Oh my God. This is the best.

36
00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.716
Thank you so much for being here.

37
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.177
What's… Uh… Okay. [laughs]

38
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.347
I have so much to tell you. genuinely. Um…

39
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.350
What is everybody's name?
Should we just start…

40
00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:25.186
On the count of three.
everybody say your name.

41
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.437
Ready? One. two. three.

42
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.231
[crowd yelling names indistinctly]

43
00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.276
Hello. uh. I'm Mae.

44
00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.653
I'm so pumped to be in Canada right now.

45
00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.864
-Just. I really…
-[crowd cheering]

46
00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.868
Um. I… I am Canadian.

47
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.578
-I'm very Canadian.
-[scattered whoops]

48
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:45.290
But. please. I've been living
in England for the past 12 years.

49
00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:49.294
I've been living in London.
So I do sound a bit like an asshole.

50
00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.296
I do have a slight.

51
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:53.214
like. Madonna lilt.

52
00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:57.093
And I'm trying so hard to fight it.
I'm really sorry. But it's…

53
00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:00.471
My dad's British. Like very…
He's very. very British.

54
00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:04.767
He's like… My dad's like
a mystical British gentleman.

55
00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.228
He's very… He's a magical man.

56
00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.480
He's very into. like.
the phases of the moon.

57
00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:12.275
He's… He's a moon man.
He's into. like. um…

58
00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.944
He knows all the birds
that ever visit his garden

59
00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:18.740
and he has
a specific relationship with each bird.

60
00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:23.286
And my childhood. like my whole childhood.
was pretty mystical.

61
00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.663
Like. the best example I can think of…

62
00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:27.916
Okay. when I was about eight years old.

63
00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.127
my dad was driving
my brother and I to karate class.

64
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.004
And it was a very Canadian scene.

65
00:03:33.087 --> 00:03:36.591
It's like 5:00 p.m..
the sun's already going down.

66
00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:40.011
It's snowing. we're on the highway.
We're going to the karate dojo.

67
00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:43.348
Me and my brother in the backseat.
I'm eight. my brother's 12.

68
00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:46.684
I was a green belt in karate.
my brother was a yellow belt.

69
00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:50.188
So he was four years older.
two belts lower.

70
00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:51.147
Um…

71
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.735
Which is not important.
but I thought I would flag it.

72
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.656
And. uh. we're driving along the highway

73
00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.243
and suddenly my dad. like.
swerves to the side of the highway

74
00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.869
in. like. a panicked move.

75
00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:08.164
And tires are screeching.
people are honking. Really dangerous.

76
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.458
He pulls over.
and he's really shaken up. and he goes.

77
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:14.045
[British accent] "I'm so sorry. children.
but we have to get out of the car."

78
00:04:14.128 --> 00:04:16.923
[regular accent] We're like. "What?"
And so we get out of the car.

79
00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:19.467
We're standing by the side
of the highway. in the snow.

80
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.429
My brother. 12 years old. so embarrassed.
he's like. in his karate uniform.

81
00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:26.891
And people are driving by. they're like.
"Is he a yellow belt? 'Cause…"

82
00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.728
"Hang on a second. He looks older…"

83
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.732
"We're gonna turn the car around.
Check this out."

84
00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:37.318
And so we're like. "What is going on?"
And my dad goes.

85
00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:40.363
"I've just seen
the new moon through glass."

86
00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:45.910
So. he had seen the sliver of the new moon
through the windshield

87
00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.037
and we had to pull over.
get out of the car.

88
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.581
and he made us bow
to the moon three times.

89
00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:53.126
We had to do this whole ritual.

90
00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.920
We had to say.
"Good evening. Lady Moon." It was…

91
00:04:57.088 --> 00:05:00.425
It was mystical. He's a moon man.
He's deep into the moon.

92
00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:05.096
And. um. I was just visiting recently.
uh. visiting home.

93
00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:07.598
This is my childhood home
that I grew up in.

94
00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:10.685
and they've had it
since long before I was born.

95
00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:12.395
And I'm in the kitchen
with my mom and dad.

96
00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:16.399
and my dad comes up to me
and goes. "Meet me in the study at dusk."

97
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.276
I'm like. "But I…"

98
00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:20.486
I go to my mom.
I'm like. "What time is dusk?"

99
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.406
She's like. "I don't know." [laughs]

100
00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.908
And I go up to the study. which is like…

101
00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:29.245
It's been many things over the years.
it's been like a spare room or whatever.

102
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.998
My dad's there with a glass of wine.
looking out the window.

103
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:35.251
He wanted to show me
there's a family of raccoons

104
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:38.421
that lives in a tree
in the neighbor's yard.

105
00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.465
And. like. every night
at dusk. they emerge.

106
00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:43.593
and he's got. yeah.
a relationship with them all. Um…

107
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.637
So. we're standing.
waiting for the raccoons.

108
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.183
and he just really dreamily goes. um…

109
00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:53.019
"Do you know
you were conceived in this room?"

110
00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:54.896
Which…

111
00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.149
So I was like. "Oh…"

112
00:05:58.232 --> 00:06:02.403
And I don't like to shut him down
when he's being vulnerable. so…

113
00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:08.242
I was like. "Wait. You remember
the specific night that I was conceived?"

114
00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:11.204
And he said this phrase.
which truly has haunted me

115
00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:13.873
ever since. He said.

116
00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:16.292
he goes. "Yes. of course I remember it."

117
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.585
"I remember it well."

118
00:06:19.253 --> 00:06:20.463
This is what he said.

119
00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:23.383
"The moonlight shone in
over your mother's bottom."

120
00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:24.884
[crowd gasps. laughs]

121
00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.436
Over your…

122
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.688
I feel like
you're not fully getting. like…

123
00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:42.777
I now know the position
I was conceived in.

124
00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.363
I'm horrified.

125
00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:50.701
Nobody wants to be conceived doggy style.

126
00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.995
It's so bleak.

127
00:06:54.288 --> 00:06:57.125
You don't want…
You want to be conceived face to face.

128
00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.252
Eye contact.

129
00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:02.088
At the moment of ejaculation.
just like we…

130
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.090
"We're making a choice

131
00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:05.925
to make a life."

132
00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:09.720
Not like. "Ah! Bite the pillow!"
It's horrible.

133
00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.724
It's… It's bleak. It's like…

134
00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:16.352
It's changed how I see myself.

135
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.395
Like. how I…

136
00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:20.565
I'm like. "I'm a doggy-style baby."

137
00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.150
[crowd laughing]

138
00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:23.901
Makes a lot of sense. actually.

139
00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:25.736
Explains a lot.

140
00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:29.031
It's. like. affected my posture.
I'm just a little more… I'm like…

141
00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:30.867
Just a little hunched.

142
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.826
[laughs]

143
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:36.622
I feel like I can spot
other doggy-style babies

144
00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:40.168
when I'm out in the world. 100%. there's…

145
00:07:40.668 --> 00:07:42.712
I'll be getting on the subway.
and there's someone…

146
00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.672
[grunting]

147
00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:46.757
Smoking on the subway.
I'm like. "Oh. yeah."

148
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.678
Or I'll be in a bar.
and the bartender's like.

149
00:07:50.761 --> 00:07:54.056
"Sorry. someone's just sent you a drink."
I look down the bar. and… [grunting]

150
00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.267
Another doggy-style baby.

151
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.395
There's some in here tonight.
I can see us. Several.

152
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.314
[Mae laughs]

153
00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:04.192
They…

154
00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:07.111
Every time I go home to visit.
something like this happens.

155
00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:10.531
Something that derails my…
my grasp on reality.

156
00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:14.118
Like. um. okay.
my parents have this anecdote.

157
00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:16.412
and it's a story
they've been telling my whole life.

158
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.664
Like. once a year.
they'll have a few drinks

159
00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:21.000
and tell this story
at a dinner party or whatever.

160
00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:24.045
Um… And it makes me feel crazy.

161
00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:26.714
because I'm like. "It cannot be true."

162
00:08:26.797 --> 00:08:29.717
So. why are you
doing this to me? What is this?

163
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.011
Um. and my brother and I get really upset.

164
00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:34.514
I'll tell you the story
and then you can be the judge.

165
00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.224
if you think it's true or not. Okay?

166
00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:38.059
-[audience whoops]
-Okay.

167
00:08:38.142 --> 00:08:40.853
So. my parents swear

168
00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:43.356
that when they were
in their late twenties.

169
00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:45.650
they were driving
through Northern Ontario.

170
00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:48.110
down a winding road through a forest.

171
00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:51.697
and they drove under a moose.

172
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.492
[crowd laughing]

173
00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:56.953
[scoffs]

174
00:08:57.745 --> 00:08:58.955
They swear.

175
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.040
They swear.

176
00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:05.878
My mom says they were driving
down this winding road.

177
00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:07.880
the moose was horizontal on the road.

178
00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.049
and they drove under its belly.

179
00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:12.760
It makes me feel insane.

180
00:09:12.843 --> 00:09:14.929
I'm like. "What are you talking about?"

181
00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:18.140
It's… And so it's… [laughs]

182
00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.725
She does a sound effect

183
00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.645
of the sound of the belly fur of the moose

184
00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:24.647
gently grazing the roof of the car.

185
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.649
Just like… [whooshes softly]

186
00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:28.025
Can you imagine?

187
00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:32.071
It makes me feel insane.
It makes me feel crazy.

188
00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:36.033
And. uh. it makes
my brother irate. as well. Because…

189
00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:37.577
So. the last time I was visiting.

190
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.246
me and my brother were like.
"We need to get to the bottom of this."

191
00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:42.707
We need to find out
if this is even possible.

192
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.250
So we did research

193
00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:47.169
and we found out
the height of a Toyota Tercel.

194
00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.130
That's the car they were driving.

195
00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:51.173
So. the height of the roof of the car.

196
00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:54.010
We Googled the largest
ever recorded moose.

197
00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:58.723
And the infuriating thing is

198
00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:02.643
it could <i>just</i> have happened.

199
00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:10.484
It could <i>just</i> have happened.

200
00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:15.031
If they happened to stumble upon
the biggest-ever recorded moose.

201
00:10:15.656 --> 00:10:17.408
I guess it's possible.

202
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:18.826
It makes me feel insane.

203
00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:23.331
[sighs] You think it's true?
Give a cheer if you think it's true.

204
00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:25.666
[crowd cheering]

205
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.751
Really?

206
00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.170
Give a cheer if you think it's bullshit.

207
00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:31.213
-[loud cheering]
-See?

208
00:10:31.922 --> 00:10:32.965
I don't know.

209
00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:35.509
I think it says a lot
about your worldview.

210
00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:40.348
Like. if you believe in the moose.
you're young at heart. You…

211
00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:45.353
You've retained a sliver of.
like. childlike enthusiasm

212
00:10:45.853 --> 00:10:46.729
about life.

213
00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.981
And if you don't believe
in the moose. you're…

214
00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:50.900
Look. it's been a tough couple years.

215
00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:54.945
It's been tough. hasn't it? Oh my God.

216
00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:58.407
It really has. We got to do
whatever it takes to get by.

217
00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.534
You know? Whatever makes you feel good.

218
00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:04.830
Like… So my father
sent me a news article recently.

219
00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:08.042
Uh. he sent me this news article.
and was like. "I thought you'd like this."

220
00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:10.878
"I thought you'd relate to it."
Those are the words he used.

221
00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:12.630
"I thought you'd really relate to this."

222
00:11:12.713 --> 00:11:15.508
This was the story.
and I haven't stopped thinking about it.

223
00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:19.053
I'm going to tell it to you.
So this. it happened in the Netherlands.

224
00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:21.263
in a small town in the Netherlands.

225
00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:25.935
where basically this family noticed
that they weren't getting any mail.

226
00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:28.896
They were like. "We haven't received
any mail in a long time."

227
00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:30.648
Weeks start going by.

228
00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:33.067
They're like.
"Wait. We're not even getting our bills

229
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.653
or pamphlets in the mail.
This is really weird."

230
00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:38.739
So they go to their neighbors.
"Are you guys getting your mail?"

231
00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:41.826
They're like. "No.
This is so weird. Not for so long."

232
00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:45.996
So they go to the post office
and speak to. like. the boss.

233
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.748
The mail boss. you know. [chuckling]

234
00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.709
You know. the mail boss…

235
00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.253
that you have to defeat

236
00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.048
to pass Level 10. [laughs]

237
00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.300
He's like… [growls] And. um…

238
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.470
They're like.
"We're not getting any of our mail."

239
00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.222
He's like. "I'll look into it."

240
00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:06.517
He goes to speak to the mailman
who's responsible for that block.

241
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.229
And I can't remember the mailman's name.
so we'll call him like… Gary.

242
00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:11.647
We'll call him Gary.

243
00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:15.651
He's like. "Gary. these people are saying
that they're not getting their mail."

244
00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:16.902
"What's going on?"

245
00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:19.488
And Gary's like
weirdly defensive right away.

246
00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:22.533
He's like. "I don't know what to tell you.
I deliver the mail."

247
00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:25.536
"If they're not getting mail.
it means no one's writing to them."

248
00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:27.079
They're like. "Okay."

249
00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:29.623
So the mail boss is like. "Okay. Gary."

250
00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:33.335
But privately. to his coworkers.
he's like. "What's up with Gary?"

251
00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:34.920
Gary is being really weird.

252
00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:37.298
So they decide
they're going to keep an eye on Gary

253
00:12:37.381 --> 00:12:38.924
and investigate the sitch.

254
00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:40.468
And so. the next day.

255
00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:43.429
Gary comes to work and first red flag.

256
00:12:43.512 --> 00:12:46.056
he picks up the mail
and gets in his personal vehicle.

257
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.892
Not the mail truck or whatever.

258
00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:50.311
Gets in his… And he drives out of town.

259
00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:54.190
So they're like. "Fuck."
And they followed him.

260
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.025
They follow him.

261
00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:58.652
and he drives into the forest
in the Netherlands.

262
00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:00.863
And they follow him at a distance.

263
00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:03.908
They watch him park. They park.
They're keeping an eye on him.

264
00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:05.576
They see him get out of the car.

265
00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:09.288
He takes the bag of mail. he goes
into the woods. he's gone 45 minutes.

266
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:11.290
He comes back out with no bag.

267
00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:13.918
Gets in his car. drives away.

268
00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:17.254
So they go in after him.
Into the forest. And…

269
00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:20.716
Imagine this. This is the sight
they're confronted with. okay?

270
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.761
Beautiful. dappled sunlight. you know.

271
00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:25.554
Mist rising from the moss.

272
00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:29.558
There's a lone moose.
A huge moose in the background.

273
00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.727
Just towering over the trees. truly.

274
00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:33.521
Um… [laughs]

275
00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:36.232
And they see. as far as the eye can see.

276
00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:39.443
there are hundreds of piles
of freshly turned earth.

277
00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:42.530
Little-- In neat rows
stretching through the forest.

278
00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:44.907
And they dust. they brush the dirt up.

279
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.076
Gary's been burying the mail.

280
00:13:48.702 --> 00:13:50.246
He's been burying the mail for ages.

281
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:54.083
This has obviously been going on
a long time and it's now amped up.

282
00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.668
They're like. "Fuck." And. uh…

283
00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:58.587
They approach him the next day at work.

284
00:13:58.671 --> 00:13:59.672
Gently.

285
00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:02.091
They approach him gently.
They're like. "Hey. Gar. Um…"

286
00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:03.676
[clicks tongue] "I…"

287
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:07.137
"We noticed you've been burying the mail."

288
00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:12.184
"And we were just wondering.
why are you doing that?"

289
00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:16.105
And in the news article. this was
the direct quote from the mailman.

290
00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:18.983
in answer to the question.
"Why are you burying the mail?"

291
00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:21.485
This is what he said. He said.

292
00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:24.321
"I did it once. it felt good."

293
00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:30.578
"And now it's just kind of what I do."

294
00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.665
I love him.

295
00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.334
He's my hero. I…

296
00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:39.461
Guys. Gary went to jail.

297
00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:42.172
He went to jail for eight months. Yeah.

298
00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:45.259
You can't fuck with the mail.
that's a federal offense. Um…

299
00:14:45.342 --> 00:14:48.512
He went to jail. And I wanted
to write him fan mail in jail.

300
00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.222
but I don't want to stress him out.

301
00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:53.183
'Cause he'd be like.
"I want to bury it. Argh!"

302
00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:56.520
[laughs]

303
00:14:57.104 --> 00:14:58.772
But. no. I really was. like…

304
00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:01.442
I've never felt so seen by my father. Um…

305
00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:03.777
That's… [chuckles]

306
00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:07.823
It has been tough.
Like. I'm trying to get back into life

307
00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:11.035
and sort of feel that enthusiasm again
of pre-pandemic life.

308
00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:15.831
Especially. I'm struggling to feel
that enthusiasm in my romantic life.

309
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.791
I don't know
if anyone is in the same boat.

310
00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:21.211
-[scattered cheers]
-But post-pandemic dating. like. I'm…

311
00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:23.964
'Cause I'm 35. like…

312
00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:26.550
In my early 20s. so romantic.

313
00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:28.594
Obsessed with finding "the one."

314
00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:31.972
My parents are very in love
and that was my model. So I just…

315
00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:35.476
Somebody would be. "Do you have the time?"
And I'd be. "I love you as well."

316
00:15:36.477 --> 00:15:37.645
Is that…

317
00:15:38.228 --> 00:15:39.313
"And I…"

318
00:15:39.396 --> 00:15:41.982
"And I want to go with you."
[awkward laugh]

319
00:15:42.816 --> 00:15:43.943
"Where are we going?"

320
00:15:44.693 --> 00:15:48.322
Um. and now
I'm just a bit like… I don't know.

321
00:15:48.405 --> 00:15:49.907
Last summer. I dated someone.

322
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.534
A man. actually.
a lovely man. if you can believe.

323
00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.662
Not if you-- Wait. not if you…

324
00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:58.749
Not "if you can believe
that men can be lovely."

325
00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:00.334
Of course they can.

326
00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:01.961
But if you can believe that <i>I…</i>

327
00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:02.920
Um…

328
00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:07.424
Yeah. so we dated for like six months.
me and this guy and. uh…

329
00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:10.719
You know it was really nice.
but I'm 35. he's 36.

330
00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:13.931
Like. at this point.
we both have big exes in our past.

331
00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:17.643
You know what I mean? We're never
going to be that big ex for each other.

332
00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:20.354
Like. we're never
gonna properly traumatize each other.

333
00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:21.855
so it's kind of like…

334
00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:24.066
What's the point? Um…

335
00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:25.401
[audience laughter]

336
00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:26.443
And… [laughs]

337
00:16:26.944 --> 00:16:30.197
So. we were in bed one night.
and we were just chatting.

338
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.701
we were having a nice light-hearted chat.
He wasn't trying to be heavy.

339
00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:37.121
He just goes. "If we had kids one day.
what would we name our kids?"

340
00:16:37.204 --> 00:16:38.664
I was. like. "I don't…"

341
00:16:38.747 --> 00:16:40.708
I was like. "I don't know."

342
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:44.420
At this point. I've had
that conversation with so many people.

343
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.046
I was like… [sighs]

344
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.381
"I don't know."

345
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:52.553
"Let me just wade through this graveyard
of dead hypothetical children

346
00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:56.432
to try to get to
the new hypothetical kids."

347
00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:58.851
I'm passing the ghosts of 'em.
I'm like. "Oh. look!"

348
00:16:58.934 --> 00:17:01.353
"There's Olive and Basil. the twins."

349
00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:02.771
[laughs]

350
00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:06.525
They're there. They're like.
"You forgot about us."

351
00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:09.319
I'm like. "Oh. fuck off."

352
00:17:09.903 --> 00:17:14.074
There's little Clementine.
I sent her to a private school. You know?

353
00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:17.161
She's got a clarinet through her head.

354
00:17:17.244 --> 00:17:19.413
[in child's voice]
"Come and play with me."

355
00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:20.956
[regular voice] I'm like. "No."

356
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.085
[chuckling] And I finally find
the new hypothetical children.

357
00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:28.005
I'm like. "I have no creative energy left

358
00:17:28.088 --> 00:17:29.381
to name these children."

359
00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:32.009
Like. "Can we just call them both Ian?"
I don't know.

360
00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:37.639
Did you guys know that…? This is true.

361
00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:41.560
In 2018. there were no new Ian's born.
There were no…

362
00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:43.270
It's a true story.

363
00:17:43.353 --> 00:17:48.025
In 2018. not a single new Ian registered
on this planet Earth. That is true.

364
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:51.236
And if you're watching this.

365
00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:54.448
and you hate the show.
at least take that with you. You know?

366
00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:59.369
Wait. so do you guys know
what I mean when I say big ex?

367
00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:02.206
-Like. you have your exes.
-[scattered cheering]

368
00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:04.041
Okay. Really?

369
00:18:04.124 --> 00:18:05.959
You're like. "Yes. we know."

370
00:18:08.128 --> 00:18:12.674
Like you have your normal exes
and then you have. like. your big exes.

371
00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:17.012
Where you reach a certain page
in the novel of your life… No.

372
00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:21.433
Uh. I do feel you reach a certain age
and you just have to accept

373
00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:24.103
that for the rest of your life
there's certain names.

374
00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:27.856
where every time you hear them.
all of your organs are gonna dissolve.

375
00:18:29.024 --> 00:18:32.444
And just fall out of your vagina.

376
00:18:33.737 --> 00:18:35.572
Or your bum hole. if you don't…

377
00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:41.286
And you have to carry around a plastic bag
just in case you have to collect your…

378
00:18:42.162 --> 00:18:43.413
[laughs]

379
00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:44.748
It's disgusting.

380
00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:45.666
Um…

381
00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:48.669
So. I have a couple
of significant big exes.

382
00:18:48.752 --> 00:18:50.129
but I have this one who…

383
00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:52.047
I want to tell you this story.

384
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:56.135
So basically. this ex.
it was a really intense relationship.

385
00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:57.427
it was like four years.

386
00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.346
And it was a secret relationship

387
00:18:59.429 --> 00:19:02.391
because it was her first
non-heterosexual relationship.

388
00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:05.394
She was like. "We can't tell anyone."
And we lived together.

389
00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.688
It was so stressful.
And she broke up with me.

390
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:09.731
which is not allowed. Um…

391
00:19:10.774 --> 00:19:13.610
Which… I thought I had made that clear.

392
00:19:15.195 --> 00:19:16.822
[chuckles] Um…

393
00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:19.241
It was a long. drawn-out break-up.

394
00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:21.952
Anyway. so at the point
where this story takes place.

395
00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:24.663
I hadn't seen her in a year and a half
or had any contact.

396
00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:29.668
I was in London and I was doing a show.
and I was feeling good that night.

397
00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:32.004
You know what I mean?
Like. I had a fresh haircut.

398
00:19:32.087 --> 00:19:34.131
I was freshly shorn. You know the feeling?

399
00:19:35.132 --> 00:19:38.343
I was wearing a crisp black T-shirt and…

400
00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:39.386
[laughs]

401
00:19:40.053 --> 00:19:42.556
Crisper than this. I'm sorry about this.

402
00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:45.475
This is… crumpled.

403
00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.144
Crumplestiltskin over here.

404
00:19:47.227 --> 00:19:48.645
[laughing]

405
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.025
Do you remember Rumpelstiltskin?

406
00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:54.902
[crowd cheering]

407
00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:57.696
What happened to him?
He used to be everywhere.

408
00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:01.241
We used to always talk about him.

409
00:20:01.325 --> 00:20:04.286
When you're a kid.
Rumpelstiltskin this. Rumpelstiltskin…

410
00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:07.039
Now you never hear about him.

411
00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:09.708
I get it.

412
00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:13.170
It's hard to stay relevant. You know?

413
00:20:13.253 --> 00:20:16.256
He's. like. faded into obscurity.

414
00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:20.636
Anyway. so I'm feeling good
on this particular night. feeling crisp.

415
00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:22.346
Feeling shorn. and. uh…

416
00:20:23.263 --> 00:20:25.933
And also my best friend Joe
was with me that night.

417
00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.976
He was in the audience of my show.

418
00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.771
I love having Joe in the audience.
he's a generous laugher.

419
00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:33.065
He's a real angel.
like. my best. best friend.

420
00:20:33.148 --> 00:20:35.442
And. um. I do the show. it goes well.

421
00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:39.613
And I go to the green room afterwards.
Out the green room door to meet Joe.

422
00:20:39.696 --> 00:20:42.491
And I'm… It was a good show.
I'm like. "Hey. man. Fun show."

423
00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:44.117
But he's like green.

424
00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:46.995
Just all the color has left his face.
and he just goes.

425
00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.080
"She's here."

426
00:20:48.872 --> 00:20:50.332
And I'm like. "Fuck."

427
00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:53.335
I know exactly who he means right away.
so I'm like. "Okay."

428
00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:55.128
And he goes. "Look. she's upstairs."

429
00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:58.465
"She doesn't know you're in the building.
She came to the bar to have a drink

430
00:20:58.548 --> 00:21:00.217
with some of our mutual friends."

431
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.219
He goes. "Let's just sneak out the back."

432
00:21:02.302 --> 00:21:05.681
"Let's have a fun night.
We'll go to a different bar."

433
00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:07.557
And I thought about it.

434
00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:12.312
And then I thought. "No."

435
00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:16.817
"I don't want to have a fun night."

436
00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:23.782
So. I'm like. "No. we'll go upstairs."

437
00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:25.575
We go up. I'm feeling confident.

438
00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:28.412
I see. there she is
with our mutual friends and. um…

439
00:21:28.495 --> 00:21:32.457
You guys would have been very proud of me.
I walk over very cool. [laughs]

440
00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:33.917
What does that mean?

441
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:35.043
I walk over…

442
00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:37.045
Uh…

443
00:21:37.587 --> 00:21:40.465
Um… No. I walk over
feeling confident. And…

444
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:44.469
I'm also… I have the element of surprise.
She doesn't know I'm in the building.

445
00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:47.556
I think this is gonna work in my favor.
So I walk over. go. "Hey."

446
00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:51.101
Our mutual friends. they all know
how bad the breakup was by this point.

447
00:21:51.184 --> 00:21:52.394
so they see me coming.

448
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.815
I go. "Hey. how's it going?"

449
00:21:56.898 --> 00:21:59.860
She's like. "Oh my God. hi."
She stands up. We hug.

450
00:21:59.943 --> 00:22:02.821
It's really nice.
I go. "Great to see you."

451
00:22:02.904 --> 00:22:05.449
"Hey. I heard you got that part.
that's so great."

452
00:22:05.532 --> 00:22:08.577
She's like. "Yeah. Congrats on stuff."
And I'm like. "Yeah. great."

453
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.038
It's going well. and I suddenly think.
"You know what.

454
00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:13.623
I need to be the one
to end this interaction." Right?

455
00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:16.710
I need to retain control of the situation.
Like. I need to…

456
00:22:16.793 --> 00:22:20.172
We talked for a while. and I go.
"Listen. so good to see you…"

457
00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:22.007
She goes. "You want to sit down?"

458
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.551
I'm. "No. no. I'm gonna hang
with my friends at the bar.

459
00:22:24.634 --> 00:22:27.429
but it's really nice to see you."
We hug again. she sits down.

460
00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:31.141
I'm walking to the bar
and she's still kinda casting glances

461
00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:33.393
over her shoulder as I walk to the bar.

462
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:37.189
And. as I'm walking to the bar.
I suddenly realize.

463
00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:39.566
"What friends at the bar?"

464
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.279
There are no friends at the bar.

465
00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:47.657
Joe has sat down at her table.

466
00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:50.535
He's a snake.

467
00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:52.829
He's dead to me.

468
00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:56.666
I'm panicking 'cause
she's still kinda looking.

469
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.627
And I'm walking to the bar.

470
00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:02.756
Thank God. at the last second.
I see three girls who were in my show.

471
00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:04.841
They were in the front row of my show.

472
00:23:04.925 --> 00:23:06.593
So I'm approaching the bar.

473
00:23:06.676 --> 00:23:09.262
thank God. one of them goes.
"Hey. great show tonight."

474
00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:10.347
So I think…

475
00:23:12.933 --> 00:23:16.103
I think probably what
she wanted out of that interaction.

476
00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:19.147
like. what she expected
from that interaction. was kind of like.

477
00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:22.150
"Hey. Great show tonight."
"Oh. cheers. thanks for coming."

478
00:23:26.863 --> 00:23:31.076
What she got was so intense.

479
00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:35.997
I was like. "Hi. how are you?
What are all of your names and jobs?"

480
00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:39.251
So tactile as well. Weirdly tactile.

481
00:23:39.334 --> 00:23:43.088
Like my arm around all their shoulders.
like my head on their shoulder. I'm like…

482
00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:45.090
Mm! [laughs]

483
00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:48.844
They're like. "Whoa. okay. Uh…"
We're chatting.

484
00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:52.389
Then. thank God. we start chatting.
it's going well. we're getting along.

485
00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:53.849
So I'm like. "Crisis averted."

486
00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:57.102
They're like. "You want a drink?"
I'm like. "Yeah." We're having a drink

487
00:23:57.185 --> 00:24:01.731
and I suddenly feel a tap on my shoulder.
and I look around and it's my big ex.

488
00:24:01.815 --> 00:24:05.527
This time she has the element of surprise.
because I wasn't expecting it.

489
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:09.906
She goes. "Hey. sorry to interrupt.
I want to say bye. I'm leaving now."

490
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.868
I'm like. "Yeah. yeah." And we hug.

491
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.495
And she said something awful. like…

492
00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:16.788
Like…

493
00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:20.041
"I'm sure our paths will cross one day."
You know what I mean?

494
00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:23.587
Something like that.
where all my organs dissolve.

495
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:25.338
Get the plastic bag out. Oh God.

496
00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:27.299
Um… [laughs]

497
00:24:27.883 --> 00:24:30.093
And so we hug.
and she's leaving. she turns.

498
00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:32.804
She's still kind of
saying goodbye to some people here.

499
00:24:32.888 --> 00:24:34.890
and I turn back to my "friends."

500
00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:39.478
and suddenly. like.
I guess I just got overwhelmed.

501
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:41.605
And the floodgates just open

502
00:24:41.688 --> 00:24:43.273
and I just start sobbing.

503
00:24:43.356 --> 00:24:46.735
So… No. my face
like crumbles. my shoulders…

504
00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:48.612
I'm literally just like… [sobs]

505
00:24:48.695 --> 00:24:51.656
They're like. "Oh my God. are you okay?"
And I just go.

506
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.950
"Laugh. laugh!" [sobs]

507
00:24:55.243 --> 00:24:56.286
"Laugh!"

508
00:24:57.537 --> 00:25:01.625
It was psychotic behavior.

509
00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:04.377
I'm literally like. "Fucking laugh. Ah!"

510
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:05.504
[sobs]

511
00:25:06.129 --> 00:25:07.130
And they're all like…

512
00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:08.507
"Ha-ha-ha-ha."

513
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.468
[laughs]

514
00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:14.596
[sighs]

515
00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:17.224
There's no real punchline
to that story. it's just…

516
00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:20.310
a vignette. if you will.

517
00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:24.981
To illustrate the level of emotion
I'm operating on. I mean…

518
00:25:25.565 --> 00:25:28.485
I have a lot of feelings.
Do you guys have a lot of feelings?

519
00:25:28.568 --> 00:25:31.238
[crowd whooping. clapping]

520
00:25:31.321 --> 00:25:32.948
It's exhausting. you know.

521
00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:36.660
I'm full to the absolute brim
with feelings.

522
00:25:36.743 --> 00:25:38.828
I always visualize. um…

523
00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:41.623
like Campbell's tomato soup.

524
00:25:41.706 --> 00:25:43.291
That it's… You know what I mean?

525
00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:46.086
Campbell's cream of tomato soup.
And then I'm full to brim.

526
00:25:46.169 --> 00:25:49.214
Right to the top of my skull.
just trying to keep it contained.

527
00:25:49.297 --> 00:25:52.008
Just trying to keep it
from sloshing out of my orifices

528
00:25:52.092 --> 00:25:56.263
as I make my way through life.
That's how I feel about my feelings.

529
00:25:56.346 --> 00:25:58.390
All it takes is
one person goes. "How are you?"

530
00:25:58.473 --> 00:25:59.641
And it's like… fling!

531
00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:01.351
Like. it shoots out my ear.

532
00:26:01.434 --> 00:26:04.104
They're like. "Oh God."
I'm like. "I'm sorry." [sobbing]

533
00:26:05.313 --> 00:26:07.274
[sadly] "That's not about you."

534
00:26:08.525 --> 00:26:09.442
[chuckles]

535
00:26:09.985 --> 00:26:12.487
No. I'm all right.
I got a therapist recently.

536
00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:14.698
-Yeah. yeah. yeah.
-[crowd cheering]

537
00:26:15.824 --> 00:26:18.952
Yeah. you have to. guys. You do. Like…

538
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.623
Well. if you're gonna complain
as much as I complain.

539
00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:26.001
unfortunately. you do have to get one. Um…

540
00:26:26.626 --> 00:26:27.502
Yeah.

541
00:26:28.878 --> 00:26:31.131
I feel like my friends were
starting to be like.

542
00:26:31.214 --> 00:26:34.384
"You should pay someone
to do what you expect of us."

543
00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:37.053
I was like. "Oh. okay."

544
00:26:37.554 --> 00:26:41.558
I found this therapist
and he's really smart and we Zoom.

545
00:26:41.641 --> 00:26:43.643
And he said something interesting
where he said.

546
00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:45.729
"Remember. you are not the feeling."

547
00:26:45.812 --> 00:26:49.858
"Sure you feel consumed by the feeling.
but you are not the feeling."

548
00:26:49.941 --> 00:26:52.402
He said. "Within you. and within everyone.

549
00:26:52.485 --> 00:26:56.239
there's a very still.
neutral. eternal self."

550
00:26:56.323 --> 00:27:00.327
"And you experience the feelings.
but you're not consumed by them."

551
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.747
He said. "Rather than identifying
so much with the feeling.

552
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:08.126
like. 'I'm anxious. I'm this.'" He said.
"Don't be consumed by the feeling."

553
00:27:08.209 --> 00:27:12.255
"Just observe the feelings
as they come. with curiosity."

554
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:17.344
Have you heard that before?
Apparently that's the…

555
00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:19.763
So I think you're
just supposed to be like. "Huh."

556
00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:26.102
"I'm experiencing

557
00:27:27.354 --> 00:27:28.229
rage."

558
00:27:31.524 --> 00:27:33.026
"How curious."

559
00:27:34.778 --> 00:27:36.404
"How curious."

560
00:27:38.573 --> 00:27:39.658
[laughs]

561
00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:45.664
I had a really. um. weird thing

562
00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:48.750
where. during the pandemic…
I spent the whole pandemic in London.

563
00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:53.088
I was just in my apartment.
in the rain. in London for… years.

564
00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:54.255
[laughs]

565
00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:58.635
And. uh. I noticed
an unexpected feeling bubbling up

566
00:27:58.718 --> 00:28:00.845
where I was. "Why do I feel embarrassed?"

567
00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:02.972
Like. I would wake up feeling embarrassed.

568
00:28:03.056 --> 00:28:06.768
And I was spending a lot of time.
obviously. in my apartment.

569
00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:09.896
in my living room.
and in my bedroom. specifically.

570
00:28:09.979 --> 00:28:12.691
And I was like.
"Wait. okay. maybe it's this."

571
00:28:13.274 --> 00:28:14.359
Okay. stay with me.

572
00:28:14.442 --> 00:28:17.612
Don't you think it's kind of embarrassing
that we're adults

573
00:28:17.696 --> 00:28:19.280
and we still have rooms?

574
00:28:20.657 --> 00:28:22.534
Okay. stay. wait.

575
00:28:22.617 --> 00:28:25.537
That we're like. "This is my room. Hm."

576
00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:29.666
"This is my room."

577
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.377
"Don't go in my room."

578
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.795
[laughs]

579
00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:37.173
It's embarrassing.
"I have to clean my room."

580
00:28:37.924 --> 00:28:42.887
And. like. please. I. of course. accept
and understand that we need rooms.

581
00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:47.851
You need four walls within which
to lay your weary head each night.

582
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.187
But I think what I find
so embarrassing about it

583
00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:55.984
is. like. the way we decorate our rooms
to reflect our individuality.

584
00:28:56.651 --> 00:28:58.737
And we're like. "I'm me." Right?

585
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:02.449
"I'm myself in my room."

586
00:29:02.532 --> 00:29:04.826
It's so embarrassing.

587
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:07.078
"I have one Himalayan salt lamp."

588
00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:09.748
"Yes I do. and I'm me."

589
00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:13.126
"I have my picture on the wall and I…"

590
00:29:13.209 --> 00:29:15.920
When you finish reading a book.
you never get rid of it.

591
00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:17.881
You're like.
"I put it on the shelf in my…"

592
00:29:17.964 --> 00:29:21.134
"That is my personality
on display for all to see."

593
00:29:21.217 --> 00:29:22.469
[chuckles]

594
00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:26.306
"No one else is me."

595
00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:30.977
And then I was thinking…
Okay. this is a little abstract.

596
00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.272
but don't you think. in a way.
our brains and our minds

597
00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:35.690
are like our rooms.

598
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:39.861
and we furnish our minds
with experiences that we collect

599
00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:42.739
to then build what we think of
as our identity and selves?

600
00:29:42.822 --> 00:29:44.240
And that's all we're doing.

601
00:29:44.324 --> 00:29:46.493
We're little experience hunters.
collecting these

602
00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:49.871
to put them on our brain shelves
and be like. "I'm me."

603
00:29:49.954 --> 00:29:53.166
And I always visualize
every experience that we collect

604
00:29:53.249 --> 00:29:55.293
is like a little novelty snow globe.

605
00:29:55.376 --> 00:29:57.378
We're just going around. being like.

606
00:29:57.462 --> 00:30:00.840
"One time I saw Antonio Banderas
at the airport. Yes. I did."

607
00:30:01.424 --> 00:30:03.676
"I'm myself. And no one else is me."

608
00:30:04.177 --> 00:30:05.553
[laughs]

609
00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:06.513
And then

610
00:30:07.263 --> 00:30:10.517
all human interaction is. really…

611
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.021
I really noticed this coming out
of the pandemic. All interaction is just

612
00:30:15.104 --> 00:30:17.649
basically taking turns
showing each other our snow globes.

613
00:30:17.732 --> 00:30:19.275
And being like. "I…"

614
00:30:19.943 --> 00:30:22.987
And just pathetically taking turns.

615
00:30:23.071 --> 00:30:26.741
And. like. someone will be
showing you their snow globe. you know.

616
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.701
and you're trying to be a good listener.

617
00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:31.246
It's a story about a party
they went to five years ago.

618
00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:33.873
And you're like. "Yes.
and you are you as well."

619
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.044
Like. "Yes. exactly. yes."

620
00:30:38.127 --> 00:30:40.505
"How wonderful to be yourself as well."

621
00:30:41.214 --> 00:30:45.009
But the whole time.
your eyes are darting to your own shelf.

622
00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:49.097
A hundred percent. the whole time…
You're like. "Mmm. yes. Well. no. Yes."

623
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.723
Waiting for your moment

624
00:30:51.724 --> 00:30:54.018
to be like. "And me as well. I have one…"

625
00:30:56.312 --> 00:30:57.522
-[laughs]
-[crowd cheering]

626
00:30:57.605 --> 00:30:58.523
Thank you.

627
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:11.411
This is so exciting. You know what?

628
00:31:12.453 --> 00:31:13.454
I was thinking…

629
00:31:14.247 --> 00:31:16.374
Well. I watch a lot of stand-up specials.

630
00:31:16.457 --> 00:31:18.501
Then my friend's special
came out recently.

631
00:31:18.585 --> 00:31:20.211
and they put out the trailer.

632
00:31:20.295 --> 00:31:24.716
I was like. "Fuck. it's so dynamic."
Like. she's so physical onstage and doing…

633
00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:26.968
I was like. "I don't really move much."

634
00:31:27.051 --> 00:31:29.053
Like I'm very--
Then I was like. "What if?"

635
00:31:29.137 --> 00:31:31.598
'Cause I really want
my trailer to be dynamic.

636
00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:33.141
So. I was like. "What if I just…"

637
00:31:33.683 --> 00:31:36.477
I know in my head
the things I want to see in my trailer.

638
00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:39.772
I just haven't written the jokes
that go with the movements.

639
00:31:39.856 --> 00:31:42.275
So I was like.
"Maybe I just do the movements."

640
00:31:42.358 --> 00:31:45.278
And then I put it in the trailer
and it's just. like…

641
00:31:45.361 --> 00:31:46.446
Just like this.

642
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.073
That's in the trailer.
how good would that be?

643
00:31:49.157 --> 00:31:50.575
You'd be like. "I gotta watch that."

644
00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:54.078
[crowd cheering]

645
00:31:55.872 --> 00:31:59.417
I should just have. like.
a hundred trained dogs.

646
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.669
They all come out on the stage like this.

647
00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:03.504
And they're all on their hind legs jumping

648
00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:07.717
and then we just have it in the trailer
and never in the show.

649
00:32:08.551 --> 00:32:09.427
[laughs]

650
00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:11.179
Um…

651
00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:14.515
Yeah. feelings. I got a lot of feelings.

652
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:21.314
So… rage. embarrassment.
These are some of the feelings. Um…

653
00:32:21.814 --> 00:32:24.984
Another feeling that I…
It's very dominant in my life.

654
00:32:25.068 --> 00:32:27.862
and I think a lot of people
relate to this. it's. like. nostalgia.

655
00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:29.155
I'm very nostalgic.

656
00:32:29.238 --> 00:32:31.407
You know?
And I know that's kind of a useless

657
00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:32.992
emotion. like I'm…

658
00:32:33.076 --> 00:32:36.746
I'm nostalgic for pre-pandemic times
and we didn't know how good we had it.

659
00:32:36.829 --> 00:32:40.708
I'm very nostalgic. really.
for pre-puberty. if I'm being honest.

660
00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:43.753
That's where it all went wrong.

661
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.338
Like…

662
00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:49.133
Yeah. and my friends are like.
"Oh. yeah. You missed the '90s."

663
00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:51.344
That's so original.

664
00:32:51.427 --> 00:32:55.014
"Do you miss how all of our parents
used to have a lot of rubber bands?"

665
00:32:57.767 --> 00:32:59.727
Do you remember how
everyone had rubber bands?

666
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:01.854
You'd find them
around drawer handles and shit.

667
00:33:01.938 --> 00:33:04.482
There'd be a whole ball of them.
What were they for?

668
00:33:04.565 --> 00:33:06.234
I have no rubber bands now.

669
00:33:09.904 --> 00:33:13.574
"Do you miss how all parents
had one big conch shell in the bathroom?"

670
00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:15.451
I'm like. "Yes. Yes. I do miss that."

671
00:33:15.952 --> 00:33:16.828
Yeah.

672
00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:20.206
And I miss the easier access
to abortion and less populism.

673
00:33:20.289 --> 00:33:22.709
-Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah.
-[crowd cheering]

674
00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:25.712
I do feel. I think I'm someone who

675
00:33:25.795 --> 00:33:28.506
I never really got over puberty.

676
00:33:28.589 --> 00:33:30.133
Well. for a couple of reasons.

677
00:33:30.216 --> 00:33:32.593
I think puberty hit me
like a ton of bricks. really.

678
00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:37.181
First of all. I'm exactly
the demographic where. um.

679
00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:39.642
for me. puberty coincided almost exactly

680
00:33:39.726 --> 00:33:43.062
with the arrival of the Internet
and the popularization of the Internet.

681
00:33:43.146 --> 00:33:46.190
I'm so lucky. I had. like. one to 13.
kind of-- It wasn't around.

682
00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:50.319
And I remember the one computer
in our classroom got the Internet.

683
00:33:50.403 --> 00:33:54.407
And overnight. the world just exploded.
everything changed. it was like…

684
00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.993
We all got our first e-mail addresses.

685
00:33:57.076 --> 00:34:00.079
Mine was hot-mae-el@hotmail.com.

686
00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:02.165
[audience laughter]

687
00:34:02.248 --> 00:34:03.082
Thank you.

688
00:34:03.583 --> 00:34:06.586
Those were the days
you could get the good email addresses.

689
00:34:07.587 --> 00:34:11.299
But it was like overnight the world
went from being very manageable…

690
00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:13.301
Everything I needed to know

691
00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:15.762
was in just in one set
of Encyclopedia Britannica's

692
00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:17.138
in my parents' basement.

693
00:34:17.221 --> 00:34:20.641
It was so relaxing.
It was like a finite amount of facts.

694
00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:21.642
That was it.

695
00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:24.437
The nice. thin paper.
You know what I mean?

696
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.023
It was manageable. It wasn't…

697
00:34:27.106 --> 00:34:29.150
Also. it was like objective truth.

698
00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:33.780
Like. no one was putting out
the devil's advocate set of encyclopedias.

699
00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:36.657
You know what I mean? Like. "Well…"

700
00:34:37.784 --> 00:34:40.161
"Are you sure Lima
is the capital of Peru?"

701
00:34:40.244 --> 00:34:42.246
Um… [chuckles]

702
00:34:43.164 --> 00:34:45.208
And then overnight it was like…

703
00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:48.377
I was obsessed with it.
I remember my friends at lunch being like.

704
00:34:48.461 --> 00:34:51.005
"We're gonna go out
and play at recess. Wanna come?"

705
00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:54.675
I'd be like. "No. there's so much work
to be done on the Internet."

706
00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:57.386
"There's so much going on."
I was like. "I have to

707
00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:00.973
copy and paste images
of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>

708
00:35:02.809 --> 00:35:04.477
into a Word document."

709
00:35:06.562 --> 00:35:09.107
I then have to print that Word document.

710
00:35:09.899 --> 00:35:12.443
The paper will be sodden with ink.

711
00:35:13.694 --> 00:35:16.280
Just heavy with ink. Like…

712
00:35:17.865 --> 00:35:19.408
I have to cut those pictures out.

713
00:35:19.492 --> 00:35:21.911
and it's going to be like
cutting wet toilet paper.

714
00:35:21.994 --> 00:35:24.789
I then have to stick those pictures
onto my homework diary.

715
00:35:24.872 --> 00:35:26.541
Like. I'm busy. I--

716
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.503
I truly feel like
I've been busy ever since.

717
00:35:30.586 --> 00:35:31.712
I'm exhausted.

718
00:35:32.713 --> 00:35:36.759
And another reason that
I think puberty really hit me was. like--

719
00:35:36.843 --> 00:35:39.095
Okay. so. yeah. Regular puberty stuff.

720
00:35:39.178 --> 00:35:42.557
then the Internet arrives
and the stuff that brings with it.

721
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.228
And then for me. also. puberty
triggered kind of a wild gender dysphoria

722
00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:48.187
and a gender thing.

723
00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:50.189
-You know what I mean?
-[crowd] Yeah!

724
00:35:50.273 --> 00:35:51.440
[laughs]

725
00:35:51.524 --> 00:35:52.441
Uh-huh?

726
00:35:53.025 --> 00:35:54.527
Dead silence. Um…

727
00:35:56.571 --> 00:35:58.614
No. but really. like. before puberty.

728
00:35:58.698 --> 00:36:01.200
I felt like I was
this bounding. androgynous child.

729
00:36:01.284 --> 00:36:04.912
very confident.
did a lot of Ace Ventura impersonations.

730
00:36:05.621 --> 00:36:08.416
And then suddenly puberty hit
and my body's changing.

731
00:36:08.499 --> 00:36:10.835
I felt very like…
And this was the '90s too.

732
00:36:10.918 --> 00:36:13.671
This was the era of girl bands
and boy bands. right?

733
00:36:13.754 --> 00:36:16.883
This was the very pop-fueled binary.

734
00:36:16.966 --> 00:36:20.595
And I went to an all-girls school.
which I just. like…

735
00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:22.013
The ubiquitous question.

736
00:36:22.096 --> 00:36:25.141
the question you needed
to know an answer to at my school

737
00:36:25.224 --> 00:36:26.601
was which Spice Girl are you?

738
00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:30.104
And it was like.
there's only five possible answers.

739
00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:33.065
You needed to know. You'd be in the hall.

740
00:36:33.149 --> 00:36:35.818
and a group of girls would corner you.
"Which one are you?"

741
00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:38.404
'Cause they're organizing
lip-syncs and stuff.

742
00:36:38.487 --> 00:36:41.782
They need to know. no judgment.
They did need to know

743
00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:44.410
where you fit into the constellation.

744
00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:47.538
It was like. "Which one are you?"
And I was like.

745
00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:49.332
"Justin Timberlake. I don't know."

746
00:36:50.917 --> 00:36:51.959
"Nick Carter?"

747
00:36:53.127 --> 00:36:54.128
Um…

748
00:36:54.212 --> 00:36:58.174
I think. regardless.
if you experience gender stuff.

749
00:36:58.257 --> 00:37:00.468
puberty anyway is a fucking nightmare.

750
00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:02.094
Like. you feel like an alien.

751
00:37:02.178 --> 00:37:05.932
and everything that was cool about you
just becomes worthless overnight.

752
00:37:06.015 --> 00:37:09.060
Like. okay. I had this trick.

753
00:37:09.143 --> 00:37:12.438
Okay. well. it's a noise
that I can make with my hand.

754
00:37:12.521 --> 00:37:15.399
And I swear. it was really popular.

755
00:37:15.483 --> 00:37:18.152
People loved when I did it.
it killed at parties.

756
00:37:18.945 --> 00:37:20.780
I'm going to do it for you now. Uh…

757
00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:23.157
Okay. maybe some of you remember this.

758
00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:25.034
Um. okay. this is the noise.

759
00:37:26.494 --> 00:37:31.165
[high-pitched vibrating vocalizing
of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight"]

760
00:37:32.333 --> 00:37:33.459
Do you remember that?

761
00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:38.172
Guys. I swear. it used to kill at parties.

762
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:40.508
People would request it.
they'd be like. "Do the noise."

763
00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:41.926
I'd be like. "Okay."

764
00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:44.095
I did it in a school assembly once.

765
00:37:44.178 --> 00:37:47.223
That was… That was too far. but. um…

766
00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:51.018
It was really cool. and then.
all of a sudden puberty hit.

767
00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:53.521
suddenly I'm at a house party.
I'm in a cupboard

768
00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:56.565
with a pimply 13-year-old boy
who's got a semi. and I'm like…

769
00:37:56.649 --> 00:37:58.317
[vocalizing "The Lion Sleeps Tonight"]

770
00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:00.861
And he's like. "What the fuck?"

771
00:38:04.365 --> 00:38:07.702
He's like. "I thought you were
gonna give me a hand job." I'm like. "No."

772
00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:10.371
"I said...

773
00:38:11.414 --> 00:38:14.834
that I could do something cool
with my hand."

774
00:38:14.917 --> 00:38:16.919
[cheering]

775
00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:21.549
He leaves me alone in the cupboard.
I'm there in the dark by myself. like…

776
00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:27.471
[vocalizing "Mad World"]

777
00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:33.394
Really mournful.

778
00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:35.479
[cheering]

779
00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:39.233
It's hard to live at that age.
It's really… I mean…

780
00:38:40.526 --> 00:38:43.237
Don't you think
that the only way to flirt when you're 13.

781
00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:46.449
the only acceptable way. is to go.
"How big are your hands?"

782
00:38:46.532 --> 00:38:49.076
That's… Don't you think?
Do you remember that?

783
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.955
"How big are your hands?"
I still kinda think that's a great move

784
00:38:53.456 --> 00:38:56.042
to make physical contact
with someone that you like.

785
00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:58.002
Except I was at my all-girls school.

786
00:38:58.085 --> 00:39:01.839
just sort of slightly getting it wrong.
"Yeah. my hands are pretty massive."

787
00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:05.176
"Yeah. yours are tiny. of course."

788
00:39:06.886 --> 00:39:10.139
Going around the playground. being like.
"Well. you know what they say."

789
00:39:17.563 --> 00:39:19.899
"Big hands. massive labia."

790
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:24.987
[laughs]

791
00:39:26.113 --> 00:39:26.989
[exhales]

792
00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:28.449
But…

793
00:39:29.116 --> 00:39:31.494
So all that was going on. you know?

794
00:39:31.577 --> 00:39:35.373
And I think for everyone.
at puberty. you do kind of…

795
00:39:35.873 --> 00:39:38.626
You develop critical thinking
and suddenly. sort of.

796
00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:41.462
the hard facts of life are hitting you.

797
00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:44.090
I think if you're. like.
different in any way.

798
00:39:44.173 --> 00:39:48.052
like. if the dominant narrative
that's being told to you by everyone

799
00:39:48.135 --> 00:39:50.971
doesn't match what you're experiencing.
know what I mean?

800
00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:55.142
Like. with gender. people being like.
"There's two. And you're a woman

801
00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:57.478
and this is what it's like."
And you're like. "Okay."

802
00:39:57.561 --> 00:40:00.523
But you're experiencing
something completely different.

803
00:40:00.606 --> 00:40:02.358
Then you kind of have two options.

804
00:40:02.441 --> 00:40:05.694
You can either question the validity
of yourself and your experience

805
00:40:05.778 --> 00:40:10.616
or you can question the validity
of everything else and the whole system.

806
00:40:10.699 --> 00:40:13.411
Once you start pulling that thread.
you're fucked. It's like…

807
00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:15.287
Monogamy. you're like…

808
00:40:15.371 --> 00:40:18.833
Can I bring two people to prom?
Why not? I don't get why not.

809
00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:21.961
And I really felt-- And also. like…

810
00:40:22.044 --> 00:40:28.217
For me. I. um. I started doing comedy
when I was 13 and I discovered…

811
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.511
I got really into drugs.
like psychedelic drugs.

812
00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:34.390
So that just exacerbated
the general existential wave.

813
00:40:34.473 --> 00:40:38.185
Like I felt like I was peeling
back the wallpaper on reality

814
00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:42.106
and I was seeing this very flimsy
scaffolding holding everything up.

815
00:40:42.189 --> 00:40:43.732
I was just like. "What is going on?"

816
00:40:43.816 --> 00:40:46.694
You suddenly realize
your parents are flawed.

817
00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:49.363
your teachers are.
like. lonely or something.

818
00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:52.825
I remember being.
"Mm. I think Ms. Buchanan's lonely."

819
00:40:52.908 --> 00:40:56.412
"I feel a huge amount of pressure
to laugh at her jokes. And I don't know."

820
00:40:56.495 --> 00:40:57.496
Um…

821
00:40:59.206 --> 00:41:02.751
And yeah. I remember
being really stressed by

822
00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:06.589
why don't we. as a society.
talk more about the fact that

823
00:41:06.672 --> 00:41:09.133
the movie <i>Antz </i>and the movie <i>A Bug's Life</i>

824
00:41:10.593 --> 00:41:12.720
came out in the same year.

825
00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:18.559
Surely. powerful forces are at play here

826
00:41:19.185 --> 00:41:22.354
and we're just not going to address it?
Like what the…

827
00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:28.277
Um… Yeah.

828
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.532
So. yeah. I was stressed and…

829
00:41:34.867 --> 00:41:38.204
And also. I think with drugs.
it was a way to get out of my body.

830
00:41:38.287 --> 00:41:41.790
I was feeling very uncomfortable
in my body and it was this trap door.

831
00:41:41.874 --> 00:41:44.793
And so I got heavily into drugs.
and the bullet points are.

832
00:41:44.877 --> 00:41:47.588
I went from psychedelics
into. like. the really bad ones.

833
00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:50.424
I got kicked out of my house.
I dropped out of school.

834
00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:53.093
Fast-forward. I ended up in rehab.

835
00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:56.180
When I was 19.
I went to a rehab day program

836
00:41:56.263 --> 00:41:57.598
for nine months. Uh…

837
00:41:58.098 --> 00:42:00.976
A rehab day program for teens.

838
00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.645
objectively. a bad idea.

839
00:42:02.728 --> 00:42:03.812
Well. in a way. right?

840
00:42:03.896 --> 00:42:05.856
Like. you get a group
of teenagers together.

841
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.192
all they have in common
is they love doing drugs.

842
00:42:08.275 --> 00:42:11.237
Every day. at 3:00 p.m.. the bell goes

843
00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.989
and they're like.
"Off you go with your new friends."

844
00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:17.910
"Run along. Bond in the alleyways."

845
00:42:18.536 --> 00:42:20.538
"The only way you know how." [laughs]

846
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.832
Um. but it was very eye-opening for me.

847
00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:26.585
It was a big turning point
because I got into this program

848
00:42:26.669 --> 00:42:28.754
and there were 12 other kids in there.

849
00:42:28.837 --> 00:42:30.589
I was suddenly like. "Oh. fuck."

850
00:42:30.673 --> 00:42:33.342
These kids have come
from actually difficult lives.

851
00:42:33.425 --> 00:42:36.011
and difficult family situations.
Like who am I? You know?

852
00:42:36.095 --> 00:42:39.890
I'm this privileged. middle-class kid.
What am I rebelling against. really?

853
00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:44.436
But I needed to be there. and it was good.
I wanted to fit in with all these kids.

854
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.730
They'd been there a while.
they were all really bonded.

855
00:42:46.814 --> 00:42:48.816
And they had nicknames for each other.

856
00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:52.194
I've never had a nickname
and I wanted to be in on it.

857
00:42:52.278 --> 00:42:55.656
I was very excited because
after like two months in the program.

858
00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:58.033
I came in one morning
and one of the guys goes.

859
00:42:58.117 --> 00:42:59.702
"Yo. Bath Water. what's up?"

860
00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:02.997
I was like. "Bath Water?"

861
00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:06.584
And they all start calling me Bath Water.

862
00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:09.837
Then the teacher starts calling me…
It catches on.

863
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.880
The teachers are.
"Good morning. Bath Water."

864
00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:13.716
I'm like. "What is happening?"

865
00:43:13.799 --> 00:43:15.593
But I get into it. I don't want to admit

866
00:43:15.676 --> 00:43:17.886
that I don't know why
they're calling me Bath Water.

867
00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:19.805
I'm like. "Yup. Not much. All good."

868
00:43:19.888 --> 00:43:24.101
Yeah. And then finally.
I get comfortable enough with them

869
00:43:24.184 --> 00:43:25.519
and we all get close.

870
00:43:25.603 --> 00:43:28.355
I'm like. "Guys. I've been meaning
to ask you for months."

871
00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.399
"Why do you call me. Bath Water?"

872
00:43:30.482 --> 00:43:33.402
And they said.
"Oh. it's because when you arrived.

873
00:43:33.485 --> 00:43:35.029
we all had a conversation

874
00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:39.825
and decided you look like the type of kid
who would drink their own bath water."

875
00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:42.286
It's…

876
00:43:43.912 --> 00:43:45.456
so specific.

877
00:43:47.207 --> 00:43:48.667
So insulting.

878
00:43:49.501 --> 00:43:51.128
And creative. yes.

879
00:43:52.379 --> 00:43:53.380
Drink their own…

880
00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:56.258
I mean. look.
I've drunk some bath water in my time.

881
00:43:56.342 --> 00:43:57.259
Sure.

882
00:43:57.885 --> 00:43:59.303
Haven't we all?

883
00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:03.599
I mean. not like with… [glugs]

884
00:44:03.682 --> 00:44:04.725
[laughs]

885
00:44:05.225 --> 00:44:06.685
With a straw. Just…

886
00:44:09.063 --> 00:44:10.356
No. but. like. we all…

887
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:13.067
We've all drunk some. haven't we?

888
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:15.235
Okay. wait. Do you remember bath time?

889
00:44:15.736 --> 00:44:16.820
Remember bath time?

890
00:44:16.904 --> 00:44:20.532
Did you ever. um. in bath time.
take your wet flannel…

891
00:44:20.616 --> 00:44:22.660
Do you call it a flannel or a facecloth?

892
00:44:22.743 --> 00:44:24.703
Flannel? Yeah. Canada. yeah.

893
00:44:24.787 --> 00:44:25.663
[laughs]

894
00:44:25.746 --> 00:44:27.539
Did you ever take your wet flannel

895
00:44:27.623 --> 00:44:30.334
and lie it on your face.
and breathe through it?

896
00:44:30.417 --> 00:44:33.337
And then you suddenly feel like
you're waterboarding yourself?

897
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.838
You're like. "Oh no. God!"

898
00:44:35.923 --> 00:44:38.592
Or did you ever suck
the water out of your flannel?

899
00:44:39.093 --> 00:44:39.927
Right?

900
00:44:40.427 --> 00:44:43.597
It feels so squeaky on your…
What a feeling.

901
00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:46.767
Bath time.

902
00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:48.686
You know what I mean?

903
00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:51.063
Know what I miss most?

904
00:44:51.146 --> 00:44:54.900
I'll move on from bath time.
but I will just quickly say

905
00:44:54.983 --> 00:44:57.111
what I miss most about bath time is just

906
00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:59.446
once a day. somebody going.
"Uh. it's bath time."

907
00:45:00.614 --> 00:45:01.907
How good is that?

908
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.992
I feel like we don't appreciate it
when we're young.

909
00:45:04.076 --> 00:45:06.620
but imagine you're on
a shitty Tinder date.

910
00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:08.706
and the waiter comes over. they're like.

911
00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:12.543
"I'm so sorry to interrupt.
Um. it is bath time for you."

912
00:45:12.626 --> 00:45:14.586
You're like… You'd be out of there.

913
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:17.423
[crowd cheering]

914
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.342
Youth is wasted on the young. You know?

915
00:45:21.677 --> 00:45:23.262
Youth is wasted on the young.

916
00:45:23.887 --> 00:45:24.763
Um…

917
00:45:25.347 --> 00:45:27.015
Yeah. so that's… Yeah.

918
00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:30.352
I think the reason
that I obsess over my teens.

919
00:45:30.436 --> 00:45:33.105
and I'm constantly processing it.

920
00:45:33.188 --> 00:45:35.899
is that I feel like
a completely different person now.

921
00:45:35.983 --> 00:45:38.861
And I did have this kind
of chaotic adolescence.

922
00:45:38.944 --> 00:45:41.155
and it was really dark. like it was crazy.

923
00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:43.907
Now I feel truly
like a completely different person.

924
00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:45.701
Like. I'm very risk averse now.

925
00:45:45.784 --> 00:45:47.077
You… Yeah.

926
00:45:48.328 --> 00:45:51.039
You should see me
on an escalator. it's insane.

927
00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:53.083
I hold so tight to the railing.

928
00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:54.793
I'm very like… [chuckles]

929
00:45:54.877 --> 00:45:56.795
As the thing's approaching. "Oh my God."

930
00:45:56.879 --> 00:45:59.006
I'm like. "One. two. three. go."

931
00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:00.215
Waiting for my moment.

932
00:46:00.299 --> 00:46:01.842
[nervous laugh]

933
00:46:02.384 --> 00:46:05.012
If I'm not ready and it's coming.
I'm walking backwards.

934
00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:06.221
I'm going. "Okay…"

935
00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:07.848
"One. two…"

936
00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:09.933
[chuckling] Yeah. Yeah.

937
00:46:11.643 --> 00:46:13.645
But I do still… I feel different.

938
00:46:13.729 --> 00:46:17.399
I do. I guess. still get
that self-destructive feeling.

939
00:46:17.483 --> 00:46:19.234
Like. that pressure building up.

940
00:46:19.318 --> 00:46:21.820
I feel like we all
kind of sometimes have those impulses

941
00:46:21.904 --> 00:46:25.073
and you have to find the healthy way
to deal with those feelings.

942
00:46:25.574 --> 00:46:27.659
Um. I do a lot of escape rooms.

943
00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:30.537
I'm always escaping a room.

944
00:46:31.413 --> 00:46:32.956
Constantly. Um…

945
00:46:33.499 --> 00:46:37.753
Like. I was on tour recently
and touring is intense.

946
00:46:37.836 --> 00:46:39.171
Also. I tour by myself.

947
00:46:39.254 --> 00:46:42.800
I don't usually have an opening act.
or a tour manager. or whatever.

948
00:46:42.883 --> 00:46:44.259
I just travel by myself.

949
00:46:44.343 --> 00:46:47.471
I have these long days
in these random cities in the UK.

950
00:46:47.554 --> 00:46:49.556
And I was doing a show in Edinburgh.

951
00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.017
I was Scotland.
in Edinburgh. by myself for the day.

952
00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:55.521
and I was having the feeling
of pressure building up.

953
00:46:55.604 --> 00:46:56.688
You know what I mean?

954
00:46:56.772 --> 00:46:59.650
And. like. I had just seen
<i>Trainspotting. </i>so I was like.

955
00:46:59.733 --> 00:47:01.151
"We're in the danger zone."

956
00:47:01.235 --> 00:47:03.278
And. uh. I said. "What should I do?"

957
00:47:03.362 --> 00:47:06.573
So I go online and I found
the Edinburgh dungeons were open.

958
00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:10.285
That's kind of like the London dungeons.
where it's like this horror.

959
00:47:10.369 --> 00:47:12.079
immersive horror experience.

960
00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:14.998
where actors dress up
like Victorians and scare you.

961
00:47:15.082 --> 00:47:17.209
And you walk through a maze of hell.

962
00:47:17.292 --> 00:47:19.294
So I was like. "Great." Um…

963
00:47:19.378 --> 00:47:21.713
And I got the VIP package as well.

964
00:47:21.797 --> 00:47:23.632
which is just you pay 20 extra bucks

965
00:47:23.715 --> 00:47:26.885
and all it meant was. when I arrived.
they take a picture of you

966
00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:28.303
in front of a green screen.

967
00:47:28.387 --> 00:47:31.056
And then they give you a key
and they project a graveyard

968
00:47:31.139 --> 00:47:32.558
and give you the keychain of the…

969
00:47:32.641 --> 00:47:36.436
That was when I was like. "Oh. This is
something you should do with friends."

970
00:47:36.937 --> 00:47:37.980
[laughs]

971
00:47:38.564 --> 00:47:40.190
Friends or loved ones.

972
00:47:40.274 --> 00:47:43.193
I do now have a keychain that's just…

973
00:47:47.614 --> 00:47:48.490
So.

974
00:47:49.491 --> 00:47:52.661
I go down and it's me
and this group of strangers

975
00:47:52.744 --> 00:47:56.373
and we're going to go together
as a group through this horror maze.

976
00:47:56.456 --> 00:47:59.459
It's tourists and families.
there's like ten of us.

977
00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:02.254
We're about to go through it.
and this guy comes out.

978
00:48:02.337 --> 00:48:04.965
and he's dressed
like a kind of Victorian butcher.

979
00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:07.759
He's covered in blood
and he's got a big butcher's knife.

980
00:48:07.843 --> 00:48:10.971
big beard. Scottish guy.
and he goes. "I'm the butcher!"

981
00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:12.848
I can't do the accent very well.

982
00:48:13.348 --> 00:48:15.475
He's like. "Welcome to
the Edinburgh dungeons.

983
00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:18.729
we're gonna fucking kill you."
And I'm like. "Yes!"

984
00:48:19.313 --> 00:48:21.815
"Yes. I've been praying for death!" Um…

985
00:48:22.858 --> 00:48:27.237
Then he goes. "But first.
I do have a few safety announcements. Um…"

986
00:48:27.321 --> 00:48:32.117
"If you are pregnant or you do
have epilepsy. don't go in the dungeon."

987
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.160
Uh…

988
00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:35.162
I'm like. "Okay." Then he said.

989
00:48:35.662 --> 00:48:39.708
"At no point will any of the actors
in the dungeon touch you or grab you."

990
00:48:39.791 --> 00:48:41.668
So I was like. "That's good." Right?

991
00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.962
Nobody wants to be grabbed in the dunge.

992
00:48:44.046 --> 00:48:44.963
So I was like.

993
00:48:45.464 --> 00:48:46.506
"Sweet." Um…

994
00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:51.053
So we start going through
and guys. it's so scary.

995
00:48:51.136 --> 00:48:55.140
Like it's just… I'm quaking with fear.

996
00:48:55.223 --> 00:48:57.059
I'm with these strangers going through.

997
00:48:57.142 --> 00:49:00.687
They do this thing where they love
to turn off all the lights. pitch-black.

998
00:49:00.771 --> 00:49:04.441
And then when they come back on. there's
a woman standing an inch from your face

999
00:49:04.524 --> 00:49:05.776
and being like… [growls]

1000
00:49:06.401 --> 00:49:09.029
It's so scary.
but I'm loving it. I'm like. "Ah."

1001
00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:12.407
There's sort of a narrative arc
where. at the very beginning.

1002
00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:16.912
the butcher was like. "You're gonna meet
the legendary cannibal Sawney Bean."

1003
00:49:16.995 --> 00:49:20.999
Does anybody know Sawney Bean?
Legendary cannibal. apparently. and…

1004
00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:25.921
We're like. "We don't want to meet him.
We're frightened."

1005
00:49:26.004 --> 00:49:28.173
He's like. "Oh no.
He's going to love you guys."

1006
00:49:28.256 --> 00:49:29.967
We know it's building to something.

1007
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:34.972
And we get to this part where
there's a sort of boat underground.

1008
00:49:35.055 --> 00:49:36.974
we're in the bowels of Edinburgh. right?

1009
00:49:37.057 --> 00:49:40.143
And there's a boat
on a track and we all get in it.

1010
00:49:40.227 --> 00:49:42.354
And we can hear
Sawney Bean in the darkness.

1011
00:49:42.437 --> 00:49:43.981
toward where we're headed.

1012
00:49:44.064 --> 00:49:46.566
going. "I'm Sawney Bean."
We're like. "No!"

1013
00:49:47.067 --> 00:49:50.737
The butcher goes. "Okay. guys.
you're on your own now. I'm leaving you."

1014
00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:53.824
We're like "No. wait.
We've learned to love you. we need you."

1015
00:49:54.324 --> 00:49:56.576
He's like "Fuck you. guys" and he leaves.

1016
00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.246
Now it's me and my group
and we're in the little boat.

1017
00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:01.915
The lights go off and it's pitch-black.

1018
00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:04.668
You can't see your hand
in front of your face. it's so dark.

1019
00:50:04.751 --> 00:50:06.336
and it's damp and it's cold.

1020
00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.214
We can hear. "I'm Sawney Bean."
And I'm freaking out.

1021
00:50:09.297 --> 00:50:13.885
Then I feel these hands on my back.

1022
00:50:13.969 --> 00:50:16.179
Going up my back.

1023
00:50:16.263 --> 00:50:18.223
and kind of coming around my neck.

1024
00:50:18.306 --> 00:50:20.892
And I'm freaking out
because I'm remembering

1025
00:50:20.976 --> 00:50:23.729
they're not allowed
to touch you in the dunge. Right?

1026
00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:27.691
I'm like. "What's happening?"
The lights come back. I spin round.

1027
00:50:27.774 --> 00:50:32.112
and there's just this middle-aged woman
who's part of our group.

1028
00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:36.575
And she just goes…

1029
00:50:36.658 --> 00:50:38.118
[spookily] "Ooh!"

1030
00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:39.953
It was…

1031
00:50:41.246 --> 00:50:42.289
insane.

1032
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:44.916
"Ooh-hoo-ooh."

1033
00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:49.087
And she was
with her two teenaged daughters

1034
00:50:49.171 --> 00:50:51.590
who are sitting
on either side of her. They're like.

1035
00:50:51.673 --> 00:50:53.842
"Mom. what the fuck are you doing?"

1036
00:50:54.843 --> 00:50:56.094
She's like. "Ooh."

1037
00:50:58.138 --> 00:51:00.599
I think about her all the time.

1038
00:51:02.684 --> 00:51:05.479
She's like the mailman.
She's a hero. you know.

1039
00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:06.980
A hero to us all.

1040
00:51:07.064 --> 00:51:08.190
[laughs]

1041
00:51:13.111 --> 00:51:17.616
But. yeah. I do things like that
to. you know. to feel alive and. um…

1042
00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:23.872
Yeah. I try to be
very vigilant about my brain

1043
00:51:23.955 --> 00:51:26.833
because I have a lot of shame
about my teens.

1044
00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:31.296
I behaved very badly. You know?
I was very self-destructive and I…

1045
00:51:32.214 --> 00:51:36.134
The weird thing is I was so angry.
I was really angry. And. uh…

1046
00:51:36.635 --> 00:51:39.596
The weird thing is since. like. 2016…

1047
00:51:39.679 --> 00:51:44.309
I remember when Trump got elected.
I was like. "So we can't deny anymore

1048
00:51:44.392 --> 00:51:48.146
that the world is slightly off its axis."
It's a little fucked. right?

1049
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:51.149
We have so much information
available to us now.

1050
00:51:51.233 --> 00:51:54.152
it's hard to deny the system
doesn't work for everyone.

1051
00:51:54.694 --> 00:51:57.656
Like. billionaires don't pay taxes
and all the stuff we know.

1052
00:51:57.739 --> 00:52:00.867
So I'm like. "Okay.
in a way. my anger was valid."

1053
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:04.663
I think a lot of teenagers feel
this righteous indignation and stuff.

1054
00:52:04.746 --> 00:52:08.083
But the method of my rebellion
was garbage.

1055
00:52:08.166 --> 00:52:12.546
Like. it was so self-destructive
and self-involved.

1056
00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:16.174
You know. it was impotent. ultimately.
I got this tattoo

1057
00:52:16.258 --> 00:52:18.593
when I was 16. It says. "Oatmeal."

1058
00:52:18.677 --> 00:52:19.553
Um…

1059
00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:21.972
It says. "Oatmeal." twice.

1060
00:52:23.306 --> 00:52:26.309
I remember being like.
"Fuck the man. you know."

1061
00:52:26.393 --> 00:52:28.019
Like. what?

1062
00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:30.814
[chuckles]

1063
00:52:36.862 --> 00:52:38.488
So that's there for good. Uh…

1064
00:52:39.447 --> 00:52:41.449
[scattered cheers]

1065
00:52:43.535 --> 00:52:44.536
I…

1066
00:52:45.453 --> 00:52:47.164
I remember feeling like…

1067
00:52:47.873 --> 00:52:51.334
I felt like the world was a house
that had been sold to me

1068
00:52:51.418 --> 00:52:54.880
at a very young age when I was
too young to be signing mortgages.

1069
00:52:54.963 --> 00:52:57.549
A house that was sold to me
by a really shady realtor.

1070
00:52:57.632 --> 00:52:59.551
Like. a kind of greasy. with a…

1071
00:52:59.634 --> 00:53:01.303
A doggy-style baby realtor.

1072
00:53:02.137 --> 00:53:05.599
[grumbling] "Sign here. kid."
And I'm like. "Okay."

1073
00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:09.227
"All your dreams will come true."
I sign it. suddenly I'm in this house.

1074
00:53:09.311 --> 00:53:12.647
You develop critical thinking.
You wake up in the house in your teens.

1075
00:53:12.731 --> 00:53:13.899
You're like. "Wait."

1076
00:53:14.399 --> 00:53:16.860
Hang on. the foundations
of the house are rotten.

1077
00:53:16.943 --> 00:53:19.613
the backyard's on fire
'cause the previous owners

1078
00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:22.282
kept heating it
with fossil fuels exclusively.

1079
00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:24.993
So my reaction was. I thought.

1080
00:53:25.076 --> 00:53:27.829
"All right. I'll just bulldoze
the house with myself in it."

1081
00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:32.083
And of course. now I realize
what I should have done

1082
00:53:32.584 --> 00:53:35.212
is put any amount of energy
into fixing the house. right?

1083
00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:36.630
That's what we need to do is…

1084
00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:39.674
That's hopefully what
we're trying to do. We have to. right?

1085
00:53:39.758 --> 00:53:42.677
Put some energy into making
the house a nicer place to live.

1086
00:53:42.761 --> 00:53:44.971
-'Cause it won't do it… Yeah.
-[crowd cheering]

1087
00:53:47.307 --> 00:53:49.434
I do feel we have to consciously do it.

1088
00:53:49.517 --> 00:53:51.561
Or else it won't happen. You know? Um…

1089
00:53:51.645 --> 00:53:53.688
And that's why I am really… I love…

1090
00:53:54.189 --> 00:53:56.608
I feel like Gen Z is incredible.

1091
00:53:56.691 --> 00:53:59.402
I don't believe that they're
just on TikTok. I think they're wicked.

1092
00:53:59.486 --> 00:54:01.571
They're out there. They're doing stuff.

1093
00:54:02.197 --> 00:54:06.076
You know. protesting climate change
and dismantling rigid gender binaries.

1094
00:54:06.159 --> 00:54:07.202
What was I doing?

1095
00:54:07.285 --> 00:54:10.455
I was slithering around being like.
"Does anyone have any acid?"

1096
00:54:10.538 --> 00:54:11.623
[laughs awkwardly]

1097
00:54:11.706 --> 00:54:14.000
Just like useless behavior.

1098
00:54:16.795 --> 00:54:18.296
And they're wicked.

1099
00:54:19.214 --> 00:54:20.757
I want to talk about…

1100
00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:24.386
I want to talk about. like.
the gender thing for a sec.

1101
00:54:25.387 --> 00:54:26.221
So…

1102
00:54:26.304 --> 00:54:27.931
[crowd cheering]

1103
00:54:28.014 --> 00:54:31.643
Just because I've been in the UK.
and now I'm in the States.

1104
00:54:31.726 --> 00:54:35.981
and in both places there's
a real hysteria right now around gender

1105
00:54:36.064 --> 00:54:37.065
and gender identity.

1106
00:54:37.148 --> 00:54:40.527
And I think part of it comes
from this misconception

1107
00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:43.905
that it's a recent Gen Z fad.
Or a millennial fad. right?

1108
00:54:43.989 --> 00:54:47.075
To have this fluidity
around gender. it's like…

1109
00:54:47.158 --> 00:54:50.328
Of course-- As long as
there's been human civilization.

1110
00:54:50.412 --> 00:54:52.664
we know. right.
there's been variances in gender.

1111
00:54:52.747 --> 00:54:56.793
There's been different cultures
that recognize third and fourth genders.

1112
00:54:56.876 --> 00:54:58.878
Not just recognize. revere.

1113
00:54:59.546 --> 00:55:01.089
Like I could have been revered.

1114
00:55:02.048 --> 00:55:03.675
I could have been revered.

1115
00:55:04.217 --> 00:55:05.135
It sucks.

1116
00:55:05.218 --> 00:55:08.388
And instead I'm like. "Which bathroom
am I allowed to use. please?"

1117
00:55:09.055 --> 00:55:09.931
Um…

1118
00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:16.021
And really it is a recent colonial fad
to have this very rigid gender binary.

1119
00:55:16.104 --> 00:55:20.358
It's really like we just went around
the world bulldozing over the nuances of

1120
00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.569
all these beautiful things. Um…

1121
00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:24.821
In the UK. where I've been living.

1122
00:55:24.904 --> 00:55:28.908
I remember in 2018.
India decriminalized homosexuality.

1123
00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:29.951
and it was great.

1124
00:55:30.035 --> 00:55:33.621
Like. big celebration. really exciting.
but it was really frustrating

1125
00:55:33.705 --> 00:55:36.624
'cause the coverage of it
on the news in the UK was so smug.

1126
00:55:36.708 --> 00:55:39.502
It was like. "It's about time. India."

1127
00:55:39.586 --> 00:55:43.840
And it's like. England went into India
and criminalized homosexuality

1128
00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:46.217
in 1896. Like. it's…

1129
00:55:46.718 --> 00:55:49.179
It's the ultimate gaslighting.

1130
00:55:49.721 --> 00:55:52.557
It's like lighting someone's house
on fire and being like.

1131
00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.935
"It's really awkward how long
it's taking out to put that out."

1132
00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:57.812
"It's so embarrassing."

1133
00:55:58.646 --> 00:56:00.857
-[crowd cheering]
-Yeah. Thanks.

1134
00:56:05.904 --> 00:56:06.988
Um… Yeah.

1135
00:56:07.489 --> 00:56:09.574
And the annoying thing is

1136
00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:13.328
I don't really want to talk about gender

1137
00:56:13.411 --> 00:56:15.038
because it's kind of lose-lose. right?

1138
00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:17.999
Especially if it's something that
personally affects you and you care about

1139
00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:19.959
then it's hard to debate.

1140
00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:21.628
You get emotional. you've already lost.

1141
00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:23.505
'Cause you're like…
[frustrated whimpering]

1142
00:56:23.588 --> 00:56:26.800
Like. it's hard.
but I feel like I should talk about it

1143
00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:30.053
because everyone else is. Like. comedians.

1144
00:56:30.136 --> 00:56:34.557
Big multimillionaire comedians.
in their stand-up specials are. like.

1145
00:56:34.641 --> 00:56:36.684
taking shots and punching down

1146
00:56:36.768 --> 00:56:39.771
at a time when
trans rights are so tenuous.

1147
00:56:39.854 --> 00:56:42.023
and slipping backwards. it's just not…

1148
00:56:42.107 --> 00:56:43.483
-Yeah. And. uh…
-[applause]

1149
00:56:43.566 --> 00:56:45.610
No. no. no. But I feel…

1150
00:56:46.611 --> 00:56:48.863
You're like.
"Yeah. they're slipping backwards. yeah."

1151
00:56:48.947 --> 00:56:50.073
No. just kidding.

1152
00:56:50.156 --> 00:56:51.825
I'm suddenly like. "Oh. fuck."

1153
00:56:51.908 --> 00:56:53.243
[Mae laughs]

1154
00:56:54.035 --> 00:56:57.497
The thing… And I watch
those specials so I can be informed

1155
00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:01.459
when I'm asked in every interview
to talk about those guys' specials.

1156
00:57:01.543 --> 00:57:05.922
But. like. the thing that
kept coming up was. "Gender's a fact."

1157
00:57:06.005 --> 00:57:08.174
That was the refrain of one.
"Gender's a fact."

1158
00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:12.303
Then they cut to the audience. "Aw. yeah."
They're loving it. And it's like. um…

1159
00:57:12.387 --> 00:57:15.557
I feel like I'm kind of preaching
to the choir a little here. but

1160
00:57:16.057 --> 00:57:21.563
just to quickly say… Of course.
biological sex is real. It's a thing.

1161
00:57:21.646 --> 00:57:25.024
Within that. there's tons of variation.
it's very much like…

1162
00:57:25.108 --> 00:57:28.945
Scientifically. it's not as binary
as we think. There's intersex people.

1163
00:57:29.028 --> 00:57:31.406
there's hormonal variation.
all kinds of stuff.

1164
00:57:31.489 --> 00:57:34.451
But. yeah. for sure. biological sex.
no one denies is real.

1165
00:57:34.534 --> 00:57:38.246
but gender is so much more ephemeral
and much more what to do with

1166
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:39.706
what's in here and in here.

1167
00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:42.584
Very much like.
you know. a social construct.

1168
00:57:42.667 --> 00:57:43.585
And more fluid.

1169
00:57:43.668 --> 00:57:46.212
And the way I explain it to people
who are trying to understand

1170
00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:49.549
the difference between
biological sex and gender is

1171
00:57:49.632 --> 00:57:51.718
I picture the gender spectrum.

1172
00:57:52.385 --> 00:57:54.262
You know the movie<i> Beauty and the Beast?</i>

1173
00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:55.972
Okay.

1174
00:57:56.055 --> 00:58:00.018
So imagine if at one end of
the gender spectrum. you have Gaston.

1175
00:58:00.101 --> 00:58:02.520
You remember him?
He's like. "No one fights like…"

1176
00:58:02.604 --> 00:58:03.813
Hot. He's hot.

1177
00:58:03.897 --> 00:58:06.483
He's like extreme masculinity.

1178
00:58:06.566 --> 00:58:08.818
On the other end of the spectrum
you have Belle.

1179
00:58:08.902 --> 00:58:11.029
who has Stockholm Syndrome.

1180
00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:13.573
So dark. but. um…

1181
00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:17.035
But. guys. she's still
an excellent role model

1182
00:58:17.118 --> 00:58:18.745
because she can read.

1183
00:58:20.371 --> 00:58:21.623
She loves a book.

1184
00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:24.042
You got to hand it to her. Um…

1185
00:58:25.043 --> 00:58:28.880
And then in the middle of the spectrum.
you have the candlestick. right?

1186
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:31.049
You have Lumière.

1187
00:58:31.674 --> 00:58:34.385
And I really relate to Lumière.

1188
00:58:34.469 --> 00:58:36.054
I connect with Lumière.

1189
00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:39.516
And obviously the more we empower Lumière.

1190
00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:41.601
the more fun
Gaston and Belle are gonna have.

1191
00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:44.729
Lumière's throwing parties.
They're like. "Be my guest!"

1192
00:58:45.605 --> 00:58:46.439
Yeah.

1193
00:58:47.273 --> 00:58:48.691
I have this fantasy.

1194
00:58:49.234 --> 00:58:51.152
I have this fantasy that like…

1195
00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:54.030
It's a really clear image in my head of…

1196
00:58:54.113 --> 00:58:57.492
You got Dave Chappelle.
Ricky Gervais. Louis C.K.

1197
00:58:57.575 --> 00:59:01.371
Throw Joe Rogan in there.
And they're eating a hog roast.

1198
00:59:01.454 --> 00:59:04.290
In this fantasy. it's a huge hog.
and they're ripping the flesh off it.

1199
00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:05.333
[chomping sounds]

1200
00:59:05.416 --> 00:59:08.169
They're drinking goblets of mead.

1201
00:59:08.253 --> 00:59:10.588
That medieval drink.
They're throwing their money.

1202
00:59:10.672 --> 00:59:12.840
And then they turn the TV on

1203
00:59:12.924 --> 00:59:16.010
and they see me doing my
little <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> gender…

1204
00:59:16.094 --> 00:59:17.637
Just like… "And the candlestick."

1205
00:59:18.972 --> 00:59:22.684
And they're watching it. and are like.
"Oh my God. we… Guys."

1206
00:59:23.184 --> 00:59:24.185
"We were wrong."

1207
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:26.187
"Oh."

1208
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:27.814
-And then they just…
-[crowd cheering]

1209
00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:29.023
That's my fantasy.

1210
00:59:29.107 --> 00:59:32.068
Then they just like…
You know what I want? I want them to…

1211
00:59:32.819 --> 00:59:34.362
I want them to cradle each other.

1212
00:59:34.445 --> 00:59:37.740
I want them to hold each other gently.
and just gently rock.

1213
00:59:38.283 --> 00:59:40.994
I want them
to re-parent themselves. basically.

1214
00:59:41.536 --> 00:59:42.870
Just give a little… That.

1215
00:59:43.454 --> 00:59:45.915
'Cause I do understand too. I get it.

1216
00:59:45.999 --> 00:59:48.459
It's hard to learn new language. You know?

1217
00:59:48.543 --> 00:59:50.545
Although. is it? Like…

1218
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:53.339
Omicron. you know?

1219
00:59:54.299 --> 00:59:56.759
We picked that up pretty fast. Um…

1220
00:59:58.052 --> 00:59:59.387
But the…

1221
01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:02.473
The joke I always hear.
and this has been a joke…

1222
01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:04.767
This was hack in the '90s. this joke.

1223
01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:07.437
It's come back with a vengeance
on the stand-up circuit.

1224
01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.606
It's like. "Well. like.
I identify as a cactus."

1225
01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:14.152
Or. "I identify as a lamp post."
or this inanimate object.

1226
01:00:14.235 --> 01:00:15.111
And it's like…

1227
01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:17.822
Um. yeah. I'm non-binary.

1228
01:00:17.905 --> 01:00:20.199
which is under
the banner of trans identity.

1229
01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:22.452
In that like the sex
I was assigned at birth

1230
01:00:22.535 --> 01:00:24.662
doesn't feel like it fit.

1231
01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:25.955
[giggles awkwardly] Um…

1232
01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:26.998
And. uh…

1233
01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:31.878
But it's like. I don't want to necessarily
identify as non-binary or trans.

1234
01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:35.340
I just am that. I just am.
And to say otherwise would be bizarre.

1235
01:00:35.423 --> 01:00:37.342
It would be like doing
a violence to myself.

1236
01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:38.801
That's what it would feel like.

1237
01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:41.095
It would be like
the hot tomato soup thing.

1238
01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:43.556
times a hundred. just full of tomato soup.

1239
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.475
It's tricky because it's like…

1240
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.895
You just have to take my word for it
that I know who I am.

1241
01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:51.397
It's so hard saying that to people.
It's like. I just…

1242
01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.358
You just have to take my word for it.

1243
01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:55.401
I am certain of it. And it's like…

1244
01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:59.822
I may not be certain
if a Toyota Tercel can fit under a moose.

1245
01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:02.325
Very unsure.

1246
01:01:03.701 --> 01:01:05.203
But I do know this.

1247
01:01:05.286 --> 01:01:08.915
Also. you don't have
to understand it even.

1248
01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:12.126
You know what I mean?
Like. I do not understand Wi-Fi.

1249
01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:13.544
How does it work? What is it?

1250
01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:16.756
But I know that it's real.
I know it exists among us.

1251
01:01:17.256 --> 01:01:20.301
-I just accept that it's there. whatever.
-[crowd cheering]

1252
01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:22.470
I don't let it keep me up at night.

1253
01:01:23.971 --> 01:01:24.972
I'm not like…

1254
01:01:25.556 --> 01:01:26.557
Yeah. Um…

1255
01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:30.687
Yeah. so I had top surgery last December

1256
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:35.400
and I'm on a low dose
of testosterone for this past year.

1257
01:01:35.483 --> 01:01:38.861
And it's been
the best year of my life. Genuinely.

1258
01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:41.614
And I'm 35 years old.
This has been the best year of my life.

1259
01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:42.782
-Yeah.
-[crowd cheering]

1260
01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:43.783
Thanks. Um…

1261
01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:46.202
And it's like…

1262
01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:50.915
What's weird is. like. I'm not that happy.

1263
01:01:50.998 --> 01:01:55.044
I'm not skipping around.
It's truly just the absence of agony.

1264
01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:56.254
That's all it is.

1265
01:01:56.337 --> 01:02:00.258
And that's a low bar.
and who are we to deny anybody that?

1266
01:02:00.341 --> 01:02:01.801
The absence of agony. yeah.

1267
01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:05.179
That's going to be my… [laughs]
That's going to be my album title.

1268
01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.432
Um…

1269
01:02:08.307 --> 01:02:09.434
Yeah. okay.

1270
01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:16.190
And also. I'm really just so grateful
to have the language now. Right?

1271
01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:18.818
Growing up I didn't have that language.

1272
01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:21.404
But I always felt this way
and I remember being…

1273
01:02:21.487 --> 01:02:24.907
You know when you're four or five and
your parents tell the story of your birth?

1274
01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:25.950
You know? And…

1275
01:02:26.033 --> 01:02:27.618
I feel like my parents…

1276
01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:31.414
It sounds like they were always
talking about my conception and my birth.

1277
01:02:31.497 --> 01:02:33.958
I swear we had
normal conversations as well.

1278
01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:36.377
But I remember my dad telling me.

1279
01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:39.464
"Your mother went into labor.
we went to the hospital."

1280
01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:42.049
He was saying.
"Maybe you'll have your own kids one day."

1281
01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:43.843
And I'm imagining having my own kids.

1282
01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:48.598
In my fantasy of having children.
I was never the one having the kids.

1283
01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:54.312
It was a really specific fantasy where
I was this 1950s businessman father.

1284
01:02:54.395 --> 01:02:57.231
just like pacing
the halls of the hospital.

1285
01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:58.524
Smoking. Just…

1286
01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:01.486
Really like a very <i>101 Dalmatians </i>vibe.

1287
01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:03.863
Then some nurse
would be like. "It's a boy."

1288
01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:05.740
And I'd be like. "Cheers. gentlemen."

1289
01:03:07.408 --> 01:03:08.951
"I'll name it Buster."

1290
01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:11.829
"Send it down the mines."

1291
01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:15.333
Um. yeah. Okay. we're almost at the end.

1292
01:03:15.416 --> 01:03:18.419
I have one more thing to tell you.
I'm gonna get my mic stand.

1293
01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:21.005
If I… Yeah. imagine if I lost it?

1294
01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:26.677
So. I feel like… And by the way.
thank you so much. This has been really…

1295
01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:28.513
You've been amazing.

1296
01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:30.473
[crowd cheering]

1297
01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.102
I feel like we've been through. like…

1298
01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:38.940
In terms of our worldview.
we've been through pessimism and optimism.

1299
01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:40.983
And I really want
to end on a positive note.

1300
01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:44.487
So I want to tell you
this Buddhist parable that I love.

1301
01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:46.781
Um. this is… Stay with me. So…

1302
01:03:47.573 --> 01:03:49.700
I love this story. Um…

1303
01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:51.118
And then I'm gonna go.

1304
01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:54.330
It takes place in the forest. actually.
We're back in the forest.

1305
01:03:54.413 --> 01:03:58.334
And. basically. in this parable.
this man is being chased.

1306
01:03:58.417 --> 01:04:00.586
pursued through the forest by

1307
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:03.506
what I can only describe
as a beast from hell.

1308
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:06.092
Like. a really terrifying creature

1309
01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:09.929
with a lion's jaws
and this monstrous body.

1310
01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:12.890
Its nature is pure hunger.
It wants to devour this man.

1311
01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:16.018
and it's been chasing him for days.
and he's been running.

1312
01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:18.062
And he's starting to get exhausted.

1313
01:04:18.145 --> 01:04:20.565
At some point. he's going
to succumb to the beast.

1314
01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:24.318
Just when he thinks he's gonna pass out
and the beast is gonna get him.

1315
01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:27.780
he sees this little stone well
in the middle of the forest.

1316
01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:28.906
little circular well.

1317
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:31.325
He's like. "I'll hide
in the well from the beast."

1318
01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:34.036
He jumps in.
Sure enough. the beast doesn't follow him

1319
01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.080
It stops at the top and is like… [growls]

1320
01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:39.709
He's like. "Great." He's falling
down the well. and as he's falling.

1321
01:04:39.792 --> 01:04:43.212
he feels water splashing up onto his feet.

1322
01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:45.590
He's like. "That's weird."
And he looks down.

1323
01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:48.301
And below him. where he's headed.

1324
01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:51.387
the water is churning wildly.
and he realizes…

1325
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:53.014
What's at the bottom of the well?

1326
01:04:53.598 --> 01:04:54.515
Another beast.

1327
01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:56.893
Yeah. It's a double beast situash.

1328
01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.562
Bad. Bad news.

1329
01:04:59.645 --> 01:05:01.230
Beast at the top. beast below.

1330
01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:03.816
[growls] Like that.

1331
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.944
And. at the last second.
he sees this branch

1332
01:05:07.028 --> 01:05:09.530
growing out of the side of the well.
like a gnarly branch.

1333
01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:13.409
So he grabs onto it
and he uses his last remaining strength

1334
01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:16.287
to maneuver himself up onto this branch.

1335
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:18.581
And his muscles are quivering.

1336
01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:21.250
But he's like. "I made it."
The beast is there. the beast below.

1337
01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:24.295
And the branch is creaking
under his weight.

1338
01:05:24.378 --> 01:05:27.006
like. this is not
a permanent solution. Right?

1339
01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:29.800
At some point.
the branch is going to give out.

1340
01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:31.385
And he's sweating…

1341
01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:33.638
he's sweating
in that crease here. You know?

1342
01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:38.684
If you're sweating in that crease.
you are in trouble.

1343
01:05:39.977 --> 01:05:43.439
And suddenly he looks to the end
of the branch and he sees

1344
01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:45.650
something glistening on the end.

1345
01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:48.110
He's like. "What is that?"
And so he balances

1346
01:05:48.194 --> 01:05:51.364
and he reaches out with one finger
to the end of the branch.

1347
01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:52.740
and he gets it on his finger.

1348
01:05:52.823 --> 01:05:55.368
It's golden. glistening tree sap.

1349
01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:56.369
It's tree sap.

1350
01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:58.996
And he puts it in his mouth and he's like.

1351
01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.582
"Is that? That's delicious."

1352
01:06:04.251 --> 01:06:06.754
Guys. it's positive. Wait.

1353
01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:09.298
That's… That's it. No.

1354
01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:12.385
Hello? [laughs]

1355
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:14.804
Okay.

1356
01:06:18.182 --> 01:06:19.225
Okay. Uh…

1357
01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:23.312
Trust me. I find it very positive.

1358
01:06:24.021 --> 01:06:26.816
You got to get on board. Please.
I've called the show <i>SAP.</i>

1359
01:06:26.899 --> 01:06:29.193
You truly must get on board.

1360
01:06:29.276 --> 01:06:32.655
Like. this was not cheap.

1361
01:06:32.738 --> 01:06:34.865
[crowd cheering]

1362
01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:39.245
No. but I really do find it positive
because it's. like. look.

1363
01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:42.540
Life might be a double beast situash.

1364
01:06:42.623 --> 01:06:46.335
That might be just what life--
In a way. is it not? Know what I mean?

1365
01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:48.212
But luckily there's so much sap.

1366
01:06:48.295 --> 01:06:52.258
and we have to just to take the time.
it's worth it to enjoy the sap.

1367
01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:54.176
and cultivate it where we can.

1368
01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.096
And luckily there's
an abundance of sap. I think.

1369
01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:59.890
Like everywhere you look.
if you look hard.

1370
01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:01.434
You got dogs.

1371
01:07:03.644 --> 01:07:06.397
Every dog on this Earth.

1372
01:07:06.897 --> 01:07:09.859
Like a good pair of jeans.
That's sap. That can be sap.

1373
01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:12.194
The Beatles. for me. are sap. Um…

1374
01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:16.824
Your friends. The TV show <i>Friends.</i>
No. like having friends.

1375
01:07:16.907 --> 01:07:18.242
Um. sex is good.

1376
01:07:18.325 --> 01:07:20.661
Sex with your friends is pretty good. Um…

1377
01:07:21.495 --> 01:07:23.789
Scaring people. "Ooh." Yeah. if that's…

1378
01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:28.794
I like campfires. roasting marshmallows.

1379
01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:31.255
the song "Bennie and the Jets"
by Elton John.

1380
01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:33.382
Um…

1381
01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:37.595
Yeah. hugs and sparklers.
Christmas lights.

1382
01:07:37.678 --> 01:07:39.847
all those things are fully sap.

1383
01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:41.807
All those things can be sap.

1384
01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.976
And genuinely. this may be corny.

1385
01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.395
but truly. this is sap for me.

1386
01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:50.357
Doing this makes me so happy
and it's sap for me.

1387
01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:52.526
And I'm so grateful to you all for coming.

1388
01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:53.903
[crowd cheering]

1389
01:07:53.986 --> 01:07:55.112
Thank you so much.

1390
01:07:56.822 --> 01:07:59.450
[continue cheering]

1391
01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:12.088
[continue cheering]

1392
01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.258
[man clapping]

1393
01:08:16.342 --> 01:08:19.261
Thank you so much. Thank you very much.

1394
01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:22.556
Oh. fuck.

1395
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:24.475
[sniffles]

1396
01:08:24.558 --> 01:08:27.311
[sobbing] Oh my God. Oh my God.

1397
01:08:27.394 --> 01:08:29.605
Are-- Wait. Are you crying?

1398
01:08:30.564 --> 01:08:32.858
Yeah. I mean. it was all just so sad.

1399
01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.485
[sobbing]

1400
01:08:34.568 --> 01:08:36.112
It was supposed to be funny.

1401
01:08:36.195 --> 01:08:39.990
-No. it wasn't.
<i>-</i>Yeah. it was. The whole thing.

1402
01:08:40.741 --> 01:08:41.951
Really?

1403
01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:44.328
[sighs]

1404
01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.540
Guess you and I just have
different senses of humor.

1405
01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:50.501
Well. thank you
for listening anyway. [sniffs]

1406
01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:53.212
It's good to get that stuff off my chest.

1407
01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:57.925
No. it's…

1408
01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.262
It's me. I'm me.

1409
01:09:04.348 --> 01:09:05.349
You are you.

1410
01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:07.268
It's wonderful.

1411
01:09:10.521 --> 01:09:13.274
-Well. should we get started?
-Yeah.

1412
01:09:13.357 --> 01:09:15.234
-[grunts]
-[Mae sighs]

1413
01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:18.154
-Are you excited?
-Yeah. I'm a little nervous. I'm excited.

1414
01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:19.738
Nervous is normal. This is a bit heavy.

1415
01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:21.699
The Buchanan's got
a lot of mail this season.

1416
01:09:21.782 --> 01:09:23.868
-Oh. really? Popular?
-You're gonna love this.

1417
01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:25.327
-Okay.
-All right. Shovels.

1418
01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:26.829
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Ooh.

1419
01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:28.581
-[both laugh]
-[pensive music playing]

1420
01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:31.125
-I'm so happy you came.
-[Mae] Yeah. thanks for having me.

1421
01:09:31.208 --> 01:09:33.210
I can't believe
it was supposed to be funny.

1422
01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:34.503
-Yeah. well…
-That's crazy.

1423
01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:36.589
Parts were poignant. I guess. But…

1424
01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:38.632
-Yeah. All right. so here we go.
-Okay.

1425
01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:42.261
Let's get a little hole going here.
There you go. Get in there.

1426
01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:43.554
You're gonna love this. Mae.

1427
01:09:43.637 --> 01:09:45.097
-Over-the-shoulder?
-Oh. yeah.

1428
01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:48.058
-Yeah. ready.
-One. two. three. Yeah!

1429
01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:50.436
-Feels good. huh?
-[Mae laughs] Sick. Should we…?

1430
01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:52.354
-[man] Yeah. grab some mail.
-What do you…

1431
01:09:53.105 --> 01:09:55.149
What do you usually? Is this one fine?

1432
01:09:55.232 --> 01:09:57.234
[both continue indistinctly]
