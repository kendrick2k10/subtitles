Yes.

13
00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.481
I double-parked the car

14
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:15.396

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.965
It's that big blue one
right over there.

18
00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:21.445
- In the middle of the road.

19
00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:22.968

00:02:25.841 --> 00:02:27.756
- Ah!

23
00:02:27.756 --> 00:02:30.367

Me. too!

24
00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:31.934

00:02:33.283 --> 00:02:34.415
Welcome home gift.

27
00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:36.025
- Oh. you made this?
- From scratch.

28
00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:37.287
- Aw!
- It's cashmere.

29
00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:38.375
I did everything

30
00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:39.898

31
00:02:39.898 --> 00:02:41.335

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.517

00:02:49.517 --> 00:02:50.866
Watch out for the...

- Oh. God.

38
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.000
Here we go.

39
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.220
Whoa. whoa. whoa. hey.
I would've done it.

40
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.439
Oh. hi!

41
00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.354
I would've done it.
Please. please.

42
00:03:00.354 --> 00:03:02.573
- Oh. my God. Amazing.
- We got it.

43
00:03:02.573 --> 00:03:05.010
- Dad!
- Hello! Oh. my goodness!

44
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.448
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Me. too!

45
00:03:07.448 --> 00:03:08.884
Look at that! What happened?

46
00:03:08.884 --> 00:03:10.625
- So. how was camp?
- It was amazing.

47
00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:11.713
- So. you were in a play?
- Yep!

48
00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:13.715
Oh. my God. That's incredible.

49
00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:15.151
- What are those boxes for?
- Don't worry about that.

50
00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:16.239
I want to hear
more about camp.

51
00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.414
What else did you learn?

52
00:03:17.414 --> 00:03:18.502
- What else did you do?
- You're moving.

53
00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:21.940
- What?
- Really. Mom?

54
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.594
- Sylvia. You promised.
- Oh. wow.

55
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.205
We're moving?

56
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.554
Look. it's...
Look. we we're...

57
00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:28.077
She saw the boxes.

58
00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:29.470
- She was putting it together.
- I don't think she was.

59
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.862
- We're moving?
- Okay.

60
00:03:30.862 --> 00:03:32.386
Just...

61
00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:34.431
Look. we wanted you
to settle in

62
00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:36.085
before we sprung the news.

63
00:03:36.085 --> 00:03:38.261
But. um. your dad
got his promotion.

64
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:40.568
Yeah. Isn't that great?
And we found

65
00:03:40.568 --> 00:03:41.656
- this great house.
Oh. the best house.

66
00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:43.135
- The best house.
- Where?

67
00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:45.747
Well. that's the thing.
We got really lucky. And...

68
00:03:45.747 --> 00:03:47.792
- New Jersey.
Ah...

69
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.579
- New Jersey?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

70
00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.537
- I said I'd stay out of it.

71
00:03:53.537 --> 00:03:55.191
We're leaving New York?

72
00:03:55.191 --> 00:03:57.237
Barely leaving New York.

73
00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.064
It's just on the other side
of the river.

74
00:03:59.064 --> 00:04:00.283
But...

75
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:03.547
But we're happy here.
We don't need to move.

76
00:04:03.547 --> 00:04:05.854
No. we don't need to move
but we want to move. Right?

77
00:04:05.854 --> 00:04:07.247
I don't.

78
00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.250
I'll have to leave
all of my friends

79
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.077
and change schools

80
00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:14.254
and I'll never
see Grandma anymore.

81
00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.907
That is not true.

82
00:04:15.907 --> 00:04:17.605
Look. you're going to keep
all your friends here

83
00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:21.043
and you're going to make more
friends. And listen to this.

84
00:04:21.043 --> 00:04:22.436
I'm not going to work anymore.

85
00:04:23.524 --> 00:04:25.700
Do you know what that means?

86
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.268
That means that I'm not going
to be gone all the time.

87
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.879
Running from class to class.

88
00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.925
God. Do you know how
bad I felt about that?

89
00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.277
But you love teaching art.

90
00:04:38.495 --> 00:04:42.847
Oh. yeah.
Yeah. I do. I do. but...

91
00:04:42.847 --> 00:04:45.589
But this is.
this is our opportunity.

92
00:04:46.677 --> 00:04:48.244
I'll be home now.

93
00:04:48.244 --> 00:04:51.987
I can be home with you
every single day.

94
00:04:51.987 --> 00:04:53.597
I'll get involved
at your school.

95
00:04:53.597 --> 00:04:55.643
just like
all your friends' moms.

96
00:04:55.643 --> 00:04:58.907
And we'll have family dinners
and I'll learn to cook.

97
00:05:00.952 --> 00:05:02.171
I know it's a lot.

98
00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:05.130
Can you just
try to believe us?

99
00:05:08.177 --> 00:05:09.265
Yeah.

100
00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:12.224
Mmm.

101
00:05:13.922 --> 00:05:16.054
I love you so much. Come here.

102
00:05:16.054 --> 00:05:20.276
Come here. You. too.
And you. Sylvia.

103
00:05:20.276 --> 00:05:22.670
- Sylvia. Come on.
Come on. Mom. Come on.

104
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.237
Come on.
You know you want to.

105
00:05:25.237 --> 00:05:26.456
Faster.

106
00:05:26.456 --> 00:05:28.937
Okay. okay.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

107
00:05:28.937 --> 00:05:31.069
There we go.
Oh. my darling.

108
00:05:32.288 --> 00:05:34.203
I'm never
going to see you again.

109
00:05:34.203 --> 00:05:35.770
Oh. Jesus.

110
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.903
- Wow.
- So dramatic all the time.

111
00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:40.252
What are you
taking her over there

112
00:05:40.252 --> 00:05:41.645
with the schmucks
and the condos

113
00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:42.994
on the other side
of the Hudson?

114
00:05:42.994 --> 00:05:44.082
But we're not going to be
in a condo.

115
00:05:44.082 --> 00:05:45.475
And those
mafia diners.

116
00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:46.694
where they shoot each other...

117
00:06:08.106 --> 00:06:09.978
God...

118
00:06:22.556 --> 00:06:23.731
God?

119
00:06:28.736 --> 00:06:30.172
Are you there. God?

120
00:06:31.434 --> 00:06:35.786
It's me... Margaret Simon.

121
00:06:38.746 --> 00:06:39.921
Um...

122
00:06:42.532 --> 00:06:44.404
I just wanted... Well...

123
00:06:46.275 --> 00:06:48.712
First. I've. I've heard a lot
of great things about you.

124
00:06:52.934 --> 00:06:55.327
I don't want to move.

125
00:06:55.327 --> 00:06:58.026
I've never lived anywhere
but the city. and...

126
00:06:59.157 --> 00:07:01.464
I... I don't want to do this.

127
00:07:01.464 --> 00:07:03.640
Please. I'm begging you.

128
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.251
Just please. just stop
this move from happening.

129
00:07:10.952 --> 00:07:14.434
Um. if...
if you can't do that...

130
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.614
Just please don't let
New Jersey be too horrible.

131
00:07:52.602 --> 00:07:55.300
- You're gonna have
to hurry up. all right?
- Okay. Dad!

132
00:08:17.627 --> 00:08:20.108
Okay. you.
You need some light.

133
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:24.504
Oh. God.

134
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.115
They smell bad?

135
00:08:27.115 --> 00:08:29.030
Oh. they don't
smell good. honey.

136
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.642
- You're going to be there
very soon. Believe me.

137
00:08:32.642 --> 00:08:33.817
I'll get it.

138
00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.821
I already know
your name's Margaret

139
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:39.083
and you're in sixth grade.

140
00:08:39.083 --> 00:08:40.650
The real estate agent
sent out.

141
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.478
like. a tiny flyer about you
to the whole neighborhood.

142
00:08:42.478 --> 00:08:44.349
It was. like. this big
and it had your picture.

143
00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:46.743
Oh. okay.

144
00:08:46.743 --> 00:08:48.963
I'm Nancy.
I'm in sixth grade. too.

145
00:08:48.963 --> 00:08:50.138
Do you want to
come over to my house

146
00:08:50.138 --> 00:08:51.748
and run under
the sprinklers with me?

147
00:08:51.748 --> 00:08:54.185
Oh. I don't know.

148
00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:55.883
You don't know?

149
00:08:55.883 --> 00:08:59.713
Oh. no. no. no.
I just mean I'll have to ask.

150
00:08:59.713 --> 00:09:01.497
Um. just a second.

151
00:09:03.064 --> 00:09:04.369
- Mom?
- Yeah?

152
00:09:04.369 --> 00:09:05.893
There's a girl
from the neighborhood

153
00:09:05.893 --> 00:09:07.721
who asked if I could go
under the sprinklers with her.

154
00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:10.114
Oh. that's great. Yeah.

155
00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:11.638
I need my bathing suit.

156
00:09:11.638 --> 00:09:13.030
Good luck finding it in here.

157
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.206
That's all right.
She can borrow one of mine.

158
00:09:16.643 --> 00:09:18.688
Oh. hello.

159
00:09:18.688 --> 00:09:21.386
Nancy Wheeler.
I live in the bigger house
up the street.

160
00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:22.431
Come on. let's go.

161
00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:30.961
Whose class are you in
at Delano?

162
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:32.223
Um...

163
00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:35.313
The letter said "Room 18."

164
00:09:35.313 --> 00:09:37.577
I'm in room 18. too!

165
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.969
We were supposed to have
Miss Phipps.

166
00:09:38.969 --> 00:09:41.015
but she ran off
with some guy to California.

167
00:09:41.015 --> 00:09:42.364
so we're going to get
a new teacher now.

168
00:09:42.364 --> 00:09:44.584
Come on. Room's upstairs.

169
00:09:49.806 --> 00:09:50.764
Voila.

170
00:09:52.374 --> 00:09:53.593
My bathing suit's over here.

171
00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:57.640
Um...

172
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.164
- Here. It's clean.
- Thanks.

173
00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:02.602
- Where should I change?
- What's wrong with here?

174
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.563
Nothing. I don't mind
if you don't mind.

175
00:10:07.563 --> 00:10:09.043
Why would I mind?

176
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.146
You're still flat.

177
00:10:25.842 --> 00:10:26.887
Um...

178
00:10:26.887 --> 00:10:29.324
Well. I'm already growing.
See?

179
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.066
I'm going to have
a pretty big chest.

180
00:10:35.243 --> 00:10:36.636
You know.
coming from New York.

181
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.638
I thought you'd be
a lot more grown up.

182
00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:39.769
Have you ever kissed a boy?

183
00:10:41.118 --> 00:10:43.817
You mean. like. really kiss?
Like. on the lips?

184
00:10:43.817 --> 00:10:45.645
Yeah. Have you?

185
00:10:46.428 --> 00:10:48.430
Not exactly.

186
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.172
Neither have I.
but I practice a lot.

187
00:10:51.172 --> 00:10:52.652
You want to see?

188
00:11:13.977 --> 00:11:15.370
What?

189
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.545
- Sorry.
- You have to practice

190
00:11:16.545 --> 00:11:18.286
or else you won't
be a good kisser.

191
00:11:19.896 --> 00:11:21.158
Ready to go?

192
00:11:22.072 --> 00:11:23.160
Sure.

193
00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:26.207
Follow the leader.

194
00:11:27.904 --> 00:11:29.079
Yeah. watch me.

195
00:11:42.397 --> 00:11:44.051
- I'm a supermodel.
- Okay.

196
00:11:49.273 --> 00:11:51.885
- Evan. you stupid idiot!
- I'm sorry.

197
00:11:51.885 --> 00:11:53.408
You're such a great model.
by the way.

198
00:11:53.408 --> 00:11:54.496
Who are they?

199
00:11:54.496 --> 00:11:55.671
It's my dumb brother

200
00:11:55.671 --> 00:11:56.716
- and his stupid friend.
- Hey.

201
00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.630
- Mom!
- That was uncalled for.

202
00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.675
Who are you?

203
00:12:00.894 --> 00:12:03.331
Margaret. Um. we moved in
down the street.

204
00:12:03.331 --> 00:12:04.854
Oh. so you're the new people?

205
00:12:04.854 --> 00:12:06.421
Ask your dad if he wants me
to cut the lawn.

206
00:12:06.421 --> 00:12:07.857
Five bucks. and I trim. too.

207
00:12:07.857 --> 00:12:10.207
Evan!
Get over here right now!

208
00:12:11.165 --> 00:12:12.470
-  I got to go.
- Dude...

209
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.090
Got to get us more birdseed.

210
00:12:23.873 --> 00:12:25.701
Yeah.

211
00:12:25.701 --> 00:12:28.748
My name's Moose. Moose Freed.
I live down the street. too.

212
00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:29.792
Um...

213
00:12:31.141 --> 00:12:32.316
Yeah. but don't forget
to ask your dad

214
00:12:32.316 --> 00:12:33.840
about the lawn thingy.

215
00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:36.233
Yeah.  I won't.

216
00:12:37.626 --> 00:12:39.280
Oh.
now I got to go see Evan.

217
00:12:43.719 --> 00:12:45.329
Sorry you got stuck
with Moose.

218
00:12:45.329 --> 00:12:47.201
Oh. that's okay.

219
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:50.595
Anyways. listen. Margaret.

220
00:12:50.595 --> 00:12:53.120
I've decided I want you
to join my secret club.

221
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.600
There's three of us
and I'm letting in one more.

222
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.819
But you can't wear socks

223
00:12:56.819 --> 00:12:58.168
or else the others
might not want you.

224
00:12:58.908 --> 00:12:59.909
Oh.

225
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.042
See you later.

226
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.917
<i>Are you there. God?
It's me. Margaret. again.</i>

227
00:13:13.705 --> 00:13:15.316
It's the first day
of school tomorrow.

228
00:13:15.316 --> 00:13:16.883
I met this girl. Nancy.

229
00:13:16.883 --> 00:13:19.276
I don't really know
if she liked me.

230
00:13:19.276 --> 00:13:24.760
I think she just expected me
to be different or something.

231
00:13:26.588 --> 00:13:30.287
Anyway. well.
it did get me thinking.

232
00:13:30.287 --> 00:13:33.725
Maybe it is time for...

233
00:13:33.725 --> 00:13:37.468
things to be happening
around here?

234
00:13:39.166 --> 00:13:40.210
Come in.

235
00:13:41.385 --> 00:13:43.779
Look.

236
00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:45.172
<i>Anyway. just think
about what I mentioned.</i>

237
00:13:45.172 --> 00:13:46.347
It was in
with the bathroom stuff.

238
00:13:46.347 --> 00:13:47.827
I found this. too.
if you need it.

239
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:48.915
<i>Thanks. God.</i>

240
00:13:48.915 --> 00:13:50.699
- Thanks. Mom.
- Mmm-hmm.

241
00:13:53.006 --> 00:13:55.051
Oh. wow. look at you.

242
00:13:55.051 --> 00:13:57.706
Are you ready
for your first day?
How you feeling?

243
00:13:57.706 --> 00:13:59.534
It's going to be great. right?

244
00:13:59.534 --> 00:14:03.059
And if it's not great. first
days don't count anyways.

245
00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:04.365
- Right?
Exactly.

246
00:14:04.365 --> 00:14:05.714
All right.
See you later.
- Bye!

247
00:14:05.714 --> 00:14:08.412
Bye!
- Did I not
unpack your socks?

248
00:14:08.412 --> 00:14:11.285
Oh. um. uh...

249
00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:12.373
I don't want socks.

250
00:14:12.373 --> 00:14:14.331
Why? You'll get blisters.

251
00:14:14.331 --> 00:14:15.767
I just don't.

252
00:14:16.638 --> 00:14:18.596
Okay.

253
00:14:19.989 --> 00:14:21.382
Oh. Oh. wait. Dad!

254
00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:25.386
- Hey. hey. Dad!
- Yeah!

255
00:14:25.386 --> 00:14:26.778
- Hey. Um...
- Hey.

256
00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:29.477
I forgot to ask you.

257
00:14:29.477 --> 00:14:31.044
Um. a boy named Moose asked

258
00:14:31.044 --> 00:14:33.263
if he can cut our lawn
for five bucks.

259
00:14:33.263 --> 00:14:35.918
Moose? Well. tell him thanks.
but no. thanks.

260
00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:37.311
I just got a new power mower

261
00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:39.313
and I'm really excited
for the grass to grow.

262
00:14:41.097 --> 00:14:43.012
- All right. Knock 'em dead
today. all right. sweetie?
- Okay.

263
00:14:43.012 --> 00:14:44.666
- Okay.
- Bye.

264
00:14:46.624 --> 00:14:48.626
I just need to warn you
one more time about the socks.

265
00:15:13.695 --> 00:15:14.870
Oh. Margaret's here.

266
00:15:20.397 --> 00:15:23.835
Hello. Good.
I thought you'd forget.

267
00:15:23.835 --> 00:15:24.967
Guys. this is Margaret.

268
00:15:24.967 --> 00:15:26.403
the one
I was telling you about.

269
00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:28.623
- Margaret. this is Janie.
- Hi. nice to meet you.

270
00:15:28.623 --> 00:15:30.668
- Yeah. you. too.
- And this is Gretchen.

271
00:15:30.668 --> 00:15:33.497
- So. you're the fourth.
- Yeah.

272
00:15:33.497 --> 00:15:35.586
Well. you're lucky
we saved you a seat.

273
00:15:35.586 --> 00:15:38.111
Or else you'd be sitting
next to Norman Fisher.

274
00:15:40.852 --> 00:15:42.506
Ugh.

275
00:15:42.506 --> 00:15:44.944
Oh. my God.
Oh. my God. don't look.

276
00:15:46.032 --> 00:15:48.686
Philip Leroy just walked in.

277
00:15:48.686 --> 00:15:51.472
I was praying so hard
he'd be in our class.

278
00:15:51.472 --> 00:15:52.734
Who's Philip Leroy?

279
00:15:53.561 --> 00:15:54.823
Take a guess.

280
00:16:03.353 --> 00:16:04.441
Is that our teacher?

281
00:16:05.529 --> 00:16:08.358
Her?  No.

282
00:16:08.358 --> 00:16:11.013
That's Laura Danker.
Stay away from her. okay?

283
00:16:11.883 --> 00:16:13.189
My brother says that

284
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:15.409
she goes behind the A
with him and Moose

285
00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:17.715
- and lets them feel her up.

286
00:16:24.722 --> 00:16:26.637
Good morning. class.

287
00:16:26.637 --> 00:16:28.117
First. let me
introduce myself.

288
00:16:28.117 --> 00:16:30.641
I am Mr. Benedict.

289
00:16:30.641 --> 00:16:32.992
And I'm your new
sixth grade teacher.

290
00:16:34.558 --> 00:16:36.082
Please complete
the following sentences

291
00:16:36.082 --> 00:16:39.389
so we can get to know each
other a little better. yeah?

292
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:42.958
Now. I'll begin. just to
start things off for you guys.

293
00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:45.439
I love that I'm finally

294
00:16:45.439 --> 00:16:47.615
getting to be a teacher
for the first time.

295
00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:50.444
I hate...

296
00:16:51.271 --> 00:16:52.620
feeling self-conscious

297
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.013
trying not to feel
self-conscious because

298
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:56.580
then you only feel
more self-conscious

299
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.755
and then you're blabbing
in front of

300
00:16:57.755 --> 00:16:59.105
a whole bunch of kids. Um...

301
00:16:59.105 --> 00:17:01.890
I'm looking forward to
the year with you all.

302
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.371
Okay. uh. your turn.

303
00:17:14.642 --> 00:17:15.773
Pass it on.

304
00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:30.614
Yes. Okay.

305
00:17:37.752 --> 00:17:39.841
Can any of you go in here?

306
00:17:42.931 --> 00:17:44.193
Ugh. no.

307
00:17:45.412 --> 00:17:47.022
Back in the box.

308
00:18:01.167 --> 00:18:04.779
Okay. All right. Enough.

309
00:18:04.779 --> 00:18:06.563
Enough. enough. enough.

310
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:21.709
- Hello?
- Guess who?

311
00:18:21.709 --> 00:18:23.972
Oh. Sylvia. hi. Um...

312
00:18:25.191 --> 00:18:27.715
- Margaret's not home yet.
<i>- It's 3:32.</i>

313
00:18:28.194 --> 00:18:29.717
<i>Yeah?</i>

314
00:18:29.717 --> 00:18:32.850
You said she's out at 3:15
and the walk is ten minutes.

315
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.635
Yes. I did say that.
But. well...

316
00:18:34.635 --> 00:18:35.940
I'm sure she'll be

317
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.246
walking through that door
any minute now.

318
00:18:37.986 --> 00:18:39.292
Well...

319
00:18:39.292 --> 00:18:42.033
Okay. I guess I'll just wait.

320
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:44.035
Okay.

321
00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:48.910
So. how are you?

322
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.392
I am fine. I'm good. Yes.

323
00:18:52.392 --> 00:18:54.611
- And how are you?
<i>- Oh. fine.</i>

324
00:18:54.611 --> 00:18:57.048
I read that when you don't
have any loved ones around

325
00:18:57.048 --> 00:18:59.529
your life expectancy
drops drastically.

326
00:18:59.529 --> 00:19:01.096
but. you know.
I've had a good run.

327
00:19:02.793 --> 00:19:06.057
You have.
You really have. Um...

328
00:19:06.057 --> 00:19:08.190
Margaret is here.
Just a second.

329
00:19:09.452 --> 00:19:11.411
- It's Grandma.
- Oh. Where's the Band-Aids?

330
00:19:12.194 --> 00:19:13.761
Mmm.

331
00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:15.502
- Grandma!
<i>- Honey!</i>

332
00:19:15.502 --> 00:19:17.852
How's New Jersey?
Are you okay?

333
00:19:17.852 --> 00:19:19.767
You can tell me the truth.

334
00:19:19.767 --> 00:19:21.160
You know.
it's actually not that bad.

335
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.208
Well. that's great news!
Wonderful news.

336
00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:27.818
Anyway. I was thinking

337
00:19:27.818 --> 00:19:30.778
that you could come visit
the weekend after next.

338
00:19:30.778 --> 00:19:32.301
<i>I'll get tickets to a show.</i>

339
00:19:32.301 --> 00:19:33.781
You can stay overnight.

340
00:19:33.781 --> 00:19:35.565
we'll have
a little slumber party.

341
00:19:35.565 --> 00:19:36.827
That could be fun. right?

342
00:19:36.827 --> 00:19:38.351
Oh. I'd love that.

343
00:19:38.351 --> 00:19:40.788
Oh. I knew you would. Great.

344
00:19:40.788 --> 00:19:42.659
And I'll tell your mother
it was your idea.

345
00:19:42.659 --> 00:19:44.400
- Okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

346
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.360
- Bye. Bye.
<i>- Bye. sweetheart.</i>

347
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.752
- Bye.
<i>- Love you.</i>

348
00:19:52.974 --> 00:19:55.106
Hey. Mom. can I go Nancy's?

349
00:19:55.106 --> 00:19:57.108
Right now?
But you just got home.

350
00:19:57.108 --> 00:19:58.501
I haven't even heard
about your day yet.

351
00:19:58.501 --> 00:20:01.374
- I know. but can I go?
- Can I have one word?

352
00:20:01.374 --> 00:20:03.376
Ugh... Uh?

353
00:20:03.376 --> 00:20:04.507
Is that a word?

354
00:20:04.507 --> 00:20:07.336
- Can I go? Bye.
- Yes. yes. okay. go.

355
00:20:07.336 --> 00:20:09.512
- I love you. Bye!
- Bye!

356
00:20:09.512 --> 00:20:12.472
Freddy was like.
"Boom. boom. look at me!"

357
00:20:12.472 --> 00:20:14.082
He's like.
"Make up your mind!"

358
00:20:14.082 --> 00:20:15.692
- She wants attention.
- Obviously.

359
00:20:15.692 --> 00:20:17.651
I know.
With her "boobala joobeelee."

360
00:20:17.651 --> 00:20:19.653
- Hi!

361
00:20:19.653 --> 00:20:21.611
We were talking about
Laura Danker again.

362
00:20:21.611 --> 00:20:24.788
Yeah. And how she got
even bigger over the summer.

363
00:20:24.788 --> 00:20:27.269
Yeah. she looked so grown up.

364
00:20:27.269 --> 00:20:29.184
You know she's worn
a bra since fourth grade?

365
00:20:29.184 --> 00:20:31.055
And I bet you a dollar
she gets her period. too.

366
00:20:31.055 --> 00:20:32.927
Well.
I know for sure
someone in the school does.

367
00:20:32.927 --> 00:20:35.277
- How?
- I always check the bins.

368
00:20:35.277 --> 00:20:37.148
- You know those little bins
in the stall?
- Mmm.

369
00:20:37.148 --> 00:20:39.542
All right. Let's get down
to business. huh?

370
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:41.849
- First of all...
- Thanks.

371
00:20:41.849 --> 00:20:43.981
...this secret club
is a secret.

372
00:20:43.981 --> 00:20:46.810
Nobody tells anybody
what happens here.

373
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.203
- all right?
- Duh.

374
00:20:48.203 --> 00:20:50.205
Second. if you want
to be in the club.

375
00:20:50.205 --> 00:20:52.076
then you have to
follow the rules.

376
00:20:52.076 --> 00:20:53.556
What kind of rules?

377
00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:56.255
Well. I don't know.
I'm thinking of them.

378
00:20:57.473 --> 00:20:59.649
Don't rush me. Hmm.

379
00:21:00.737 --> 00:21:02.391
Oh. I have one.

380
00:21:02.391 --> 00:21:06.395
If you want to be in the club.
then you have to wear a bra.

381
00:21:08.092 --> 00:21:09.746
I have one.

382
00:21:09.746 --> 00:21:13.054
If you guys get your period.
you have to tell us about it.

383
00:21:13.054 --> 00:21:14.447
- Yes.
Immediately.

384
00:21:14.447 --> 00:21:16.100
Every detail.
Especially how it feels.

385
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.189
Mmm-hmm.
Ooh. mine is.

386
00:21:18.189 --> 00:21:19.626
we can make a Boy Book

387
00:21:19.626 --> 00:21:21.236
and write down the names
of the boys that we like.

388
00:21:21.236 --> 00:21:23.760
Mmm-hmm!
What about you. Margaret?

389
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.109
What's your rule?

390
00:21:30.245 --> 00:21:31.594
Um...

391
00:21:31.594 --> 00:21:36.077
Yeah. with the Boy Books.
we have to show them

392
00:21:36.077 --> 00:21:40.124
to each other at every meeting
and we can't ever lie.

393
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:43.824
- All right.

394
00:21:43.824 --> 00:21:46.174
Let's get
this party rolling.

395
00:21:47.262 --> 00:21:48.481
Whoo!

396
00:22:25.996 --> 00:22:27.389
Okay. honey.

397
00:22:31.045 --> 00:22:32.873
All right. Mmm.

398
00:22:32.873 --> 00:22:33.961
See you tomorrow.

399
00:22:36.093 --> 00:22:37.356
I want to get a bra.

400
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.751
Oh.

401
00:22:43.536 --> 00:22:45.146
You... You think you need one?

402
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.844
Oh. no. Oh. honey.

403
00:22:47.844 --> 00:22:51.718
I'm so sorry.
No. I just mean that. uh...

404
00:22:51.718 --> 00:22:53.154
Bras are kind of a pain.

405
00:22:53.154 --> 00:22:55.548
so you know. why start sooner

406
00:22:55.548 --> 00:22:56.897
than you need to?

407
00:22:58.681 --> 00:23:01.467
But if you want one.
we... we can get you one.

408
00:23:01.467 --> 00:23:02.468
Well. yeah.

409
00:23:03.294 --> 00:23:04.383
So you want one?

410
00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:05.514
Yes. I already said that.

411
00:23:05.514 --> 00:23:08.387
Right. Okay.

412
00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:12.391
Great. Well. all right.
Well. then. we will do that.

413
00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:15.394
- This week?
- Yes. Good night.

414
00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:20.050
Good night. Good night.
my sweet. Okay.

415
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.791
<i>So glad
that's over with. God.</i>

416
00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:32.672
I'm sorry.
Hold on. just a moment.

417
00:23:34.282 --> 00:23:35.805
Are you here
for the PTA meeting?

418
00:23:35.805 --> 00:23:39.287
Oh. yes. Hi. hi.
I'm Barbara Simon.

419
00:23:39.287 --> 00:23:42.943
Oh. Barbara! I'm Jan Wheeler.
Nancy's mother.

420
00:23:42.943 --> 00:23:45.380
- I met Margaret.
- Oh. oh.

421
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.121
We're just about to get
started. so please come in.

422
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:48.949
- Have a seat.
- Okay. thank you.

423
00:23:48.949 --> 00:23:50.298
- All right.
- Just anywhere is fine?

424
00:23:50.298 --> 00:23:51.734
- Here. Just right here.
- Okay. okay.

425
00:23:51.734 --> 00:23:53.736
Here we go.

426
00:23:55.346 --> 00:23:58.001
Thank you all for coming.

427
00:23:58.001 --> 00:24:00.656
Delano is nothing without
its dedicated parents.

428
00:24:00.656 --> 00:24:02.136
Let's dive right in
and get started

429
00:24:02.136 --> 00:24:03.746
the way we do every year.

430
00:24:03.746 --> 00:24:05.748
by forming our committees.

431
00:24:05.748 --> 00:24:08.664
First up.
we have the Campus
Improvement Committee.

432
00:24:08.664 --> 00:24:09.752
Any volunteers?

433
00:24:09.752 --> 00:24:11.450
Ooh. Okay.

434
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.756
Oh. Wonderful.

435
00:24:13.756 --> 00:24:17.325
Uh-huh. Barbara.
I got you. Okay.

436
00:24:17.325 --> 00:24:20.502
Next. the Delano
Social Committee.

437
00:24:21.155 --> 00:24:22.243
Sure. yeah. Okay.

438
00:24:22.243 --> 00:24:25.638
- Okay.
-  Great.

439
00:24:25.638 --> 00:24:27.770
All right.
The Fundraising Committee.

440
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:31.557
Good for you. Barbara.

441
00:24:31.557 --> 00:24:33.036
This is going to be great.

442
00:24:33.036 --> 00:24:35.212
All right. pencils down.

443
00:24:35.212 --> 00:24:37.737
Kindly pass
your worksheets forward.

444
00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:39.652
How'd you do. Margaret?

445
00:24:39.652 --> 00:24:40.740
I think
I did pretty good.

446
00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.002
All right. uh...

447
00:24:42.002 --> 00:24:44.526
Before the bell.
I want to share some news

448
00:24:44.526 --> 00:24:47.094
that I think will make you all
very happy.

449
00:24:47.094 --> 00:24:50.140
Now that you all
are in the sixth grade.

450
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.275
you'll get to do a full.
year-long research project.

451
00:24:54.275 --> 00:24:56.016
- Yes!

452
00:24:56.016 --> 00:24:57.496
The worst.

453
00:24:59.802 --> 00:25:00.977
Margaret. I would like
to talk to you

454
00:25:00.977 --> 00:25:02.979
for a moment after class.

455
00:25:02.979 --> 00:25:05.460
Uh-oh.
What'd you do. Margaret?

456
00:25:11.379 --> 00:25:13.381
- Hi.
- Please have a seat.

457
00:25:15.818 --> 00:25:17.907
So basically.
I'm just having little chats

458
00:25:17.907 --> 00:25:20.170
with each student in advance
of your research projects

459
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.607
to answer any questions

460
00:25:21.607 --> 00:25:23.739
or perhaps guide you
toward a topic of choice.

461
00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:25.828
Oh.

462
00:25:25.828 --> 00:25:28.396
And I read your
getting-to-know-you paper.

463
00:25:28.396 --> 00:25:30.441
And I noticed
under the "I hate" section.

464
00:25:30.441 --> 00:25:33.270
you wrote
"religious holidays."

465
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.056
Which I... I found curious.

466
00:25:39.363 --> 00:25:42.105
If you don't want to share.
you don't...

467
00:25:42.105 --> 00:25:43.280
You don't have to. Margaret.

468
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.631
Oh. no. It's just. um...

469
00:25:45.631 --> 00:25:47.546
I guess I just
don't like those holidays

470
00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:49.548
because I don't
celebrate any of them.

471
00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:51.811
My dad is Jewish
and my mom's Christian.

472
00:25:51.811 --> 00:25:54.727
so instead of picking
which religion I am. uh.

473
00:25:54.727 --> 00:25:56.642
they just decided
that I wouldn't have one

474
00:25:56.642 --> 00:25:58.818
and I can choose
when I grow up.

475
00:25:58.818 --> 00:26:02.038
And have you
given that much thought?

476
00:26:02.038 --> 00:26:04.214
Not really. My grandma
wants me to be Jewish.

477
00:26:04.214 --> 00:26:05.389
And your other grandparents

478
00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:07.653
want you to be Christian.
I imagine.

479
00:26:07.653 --> 00:26:09.263
I don't know.
I've never met them before.

480
00:26:09.263 --> 00:26:10.960
They live in Ohio.

481
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.483
So you've never met them
at all?

482
00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:15.791
- No.
- Oh.

483
00:26:16.879 --> 00:26:20.143
Well. if I may suggest it.

484
00:26:21.231 --> 00:26:23.233
I feel like
"religion" could be

485
00:26:23.233 --> 00:26:25.366
a very compelling
research topic for you.

486
00:26:29.152 --> 00:26:30.414
<i>Tickets are tenth row.</i>

487
00:26:30.414 --> 00:26:33.026
<i>dead center. very hard to get.</i>

488
00:26:33.026 --> 00:26:34.984
- Tell her that.
<i>I will.</i>

489
00:26:34.984 --> 00:26:37.204
- Is she excited?
- She's excited.

490
00:26:37.204 --> 00:26:40.207
Well. I mean. is she excited
or is she just excited?

491
00:26:40.773 --> 00:26:42.383
She's excited.

492
00:26:42.383 --> 00:26:44.951
Okay. okay. okay. okay. I'll
let you go. Well. I'm excited!

493
00:26:44.951 --> 00:26:46.735
- Okay. bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

494
00:26:48.084 --> 00:26:49.172
Hey.

495
00:26:49.172 --> 00:26:50.783
- Hey.
- What happened to the couch?

496
00:26:50.783 --> 00:26:53.829
Uh. it's time to turn over
a new leaf.

497
00:26:53.829 --> 00:26:56.353
I was thinking
maybe something modern?

498
00:26:56.353 --> 00:26:58.791
I don't know. I have to think
about it. How was school?

499
00:26:58.791 --> 00:27:01.184
You're home a little later
than usual. huh?

500
00:27:01.184 --> 00:27:03.056
Yeah.

501
00:27:03.056 --> 00:27:06.059
Hey. How come I've never met
your mom or dad?

502
00:27:07.016 --> 00:27:08.931
Um...

503
00:27:08.931 --> 00:27:10.759
Well. what made you
think about that?

504
00:27:10.759 --> 00:27:12.500
Just wondering.

505
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.111
I mean. I know
that we don't see them

506
00:27:15.111 --> 00:27:16.939
because they're
so far away.

507
00:27:16.939 --> 00:27:18.637
but why don't we
even talk to them?

508
00:27:21.074 --> 00:27:23.250
We just. we just don't.

509
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:25.339
It's. uh... It's. um...

510
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.081
It's such a long story.

511
00:27:28.081 --> 00:27:29.517
What do you mean?

512
00:27:29.517 --> 00:27:32.172
I mean.
I'll tell you another time.

513
00:27:32.172 --> 00:27:33.826
Why can't you just
tell me now?

514
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:38.352
Um...

515
00:27:43.879 --> 00:27:45.707
I just...

516
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:51.931
Look. I just...

517
00:27:53.846 --> 00:27:54.847
Uh...

518
00:27:56.196 --> 00:27:58.589
So. um...

519
00:27:58.589 --> 00:28:01.462
We don't see
my parents because. um...

520
00:28:03.594 --> 00:28:05.248
They don't want to.

521
00:28:06.554 --> 00:28:08.034
What?

522
00:28:08.034 --> 00:28:10.819
My mom and dad are very.
very devout Christians. and...

523
00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:13.300
before you were born.

524
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:17.043
when your dad
and I first fell in love.

525
00:28:17.043 --> 00:28:21.656
um. they told me that
it would be very hard for them

526
00:28:21.656 --> 00:28:23.266
to. uh. have a...

527
00:28:24.311 --> 00:28:25.312
Sorry.

528
00:28:26.139 --> 00:28:28.141
Jewish son-in-law.

529
00:28:28.141 --> 00:28:29.533
They told me it would be
very hard for them

530
00:28:29.533 --> 00:28:32.275
to have a Jewish son-in-law.

531
00:28:32.275 --> 00:28:34.800
And that
if I wanted to marry him.

532
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.976
that was my business. but

533
00:28:36.976 --> 00:28:39.543
I wouldn't be
their daughter anymore.

534
00:28:41.067 --> 00:28:42.633
But you are their daughter.

535
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:51.338
Mmm-hmm.  I guess.
um. what I mean is that. um...

536
00:28:53.949 --> 00:28:56.299
They just didn't want me
in their life anymore.

537
00:28:58.562 --> 00:28:59.694
So. I'm not.

538
00:29:04.699 --> 00:29:07.920
-  Mom.
- It's okay. Oh. honey.

539
00:29:10.009 --> 00:29:11.880
It was a long time ago.

540
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.144
I have you guys.

541
00:29:15.144 --> 00:29:17.756
Okay. you know what?
I took Dad to the station

542
00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:19.192
so we could have the car

543
00:29:19.192 --> 00:29:20.802
because we're supposed to
go shopping. remember?

544
00:29:21.847 --> 00:29:23.413
Remember? Bras?

545
00:29:23.413 --> 00:29:24.763
Whoo-hoo.

546
00:29:27.113 --> 00:29:28.897
<i>Are you there. God?
It's me. Margaret.</i>

547
00:29:30.551 --> 00:29:32.466
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

548
00:29:32.466 --> 00:29:34.685
<i>What kind of parents
would do that?</i>

549
00:29:34.685 --> 00:29:36.426
<i>And blame it on religion?</i>

550
00:29:37.993 --> 00:29:40.691
<i>God. please
take care of my mom.</i>

551
00:29:40.691 --> 00:29:41.910
<i>She's a good person.</i>

552
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.217
<i>- She's nice to everyone.</i>
- You're welcome.

553
00:29:44.217 --> 00:29:45.958
<i>Even when
she doesn't need to be.</i>

554
00:29:45.958 --> 00:29:47.089
- Thank you.
- Can't forget about you.

555
00:29:48.743 --> 00:29:50.745
<i>I don't know
why this happened.</i>

556
00:29:50.745 --> 00:29:53.792
<i>But please. somehow.
make it all okay.</i>

557
00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:56.011
And here are the bras.

558
00:29:56.011 --> 00:29:58.100
<i>Oh. also.
I'm getting a bra today.</i>

559
00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.798
<i>I'd like something
to put in it. please.</i>

560
00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.061
Excuse me.

561
00:30:02.061 --> 00:30:05.064
Uh. we're looking for a bra
for my daughter.

562
00:30:05.064 --> 00:30:08.328
Hmm. Well. we don't have
many that small.

563
00:30:08.328 --> 00:30:10.025
But come with me. dear.
I'll measure you.

564
00:30:14.508 --> 00:30:15.639
Arms up. dear.

565
00:30:21.254 --> 00:30:22.603
Hmm.

566
00:30:22.603 --> 00:30:26.128
Barely a 28.
Not even a double-A.

567
00:30:26.128 --> 00:30:27.608
Your best bet
is going to be to go with

568
00:30:27.608 --> 00:30:29.349
- one of these Gro-Bras here.
- It's okay.

569
00:30:29.349 --> 00:30:32.265
So. one day. when you do grow.
it'll grow with you.

570
00:30:32.265 --> 00:30:34.006
Okay. Thank you very much.

571
00:30:34.006 --> 00:30:36.051
Sure.
- Thanks. we'll just
go try it on.

572
00:30:40.142 --> 00:30:42.710
- Um...
- Hmm? Oh.

573
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.973
Yeah. Can I just...
I'll just... Yep.

574
00:30:44.973 --> 00:30:47.106
Here we go.

575
00:30:47.106 --> 00:30:49.499
This is
always the tough bit.

576
00:30:49.499 --> 00:30:52.067
I can't even do this
to this day.

577
00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:55.636
Okay. All right. Can I see?

578
00:30:58.944 --> 00:31:01.729
- How's that feel?
- I cannot wait to take it off.

579
00:31:01.729 --> 00:31:04.253
Yeah. Welcome to womanhood.

580
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:35.850
Oh. hello.

581
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:36.938
Hello.

582
00:31:36.938 --> 00:31:39.941
Look at you. Working the land.

583
00:31:40.942 --> 00:31:42.509
Heavy machinery. ouch.

584
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:44.598
Be better if I take
my shirt off or it's too much?

585
00:31:44.598 --> 00:31:45.860
Not for me.

586
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.688
- Ooh.

587
00:31:47.688 --> 00:31:49.124
There it is. yeah.

588
00:31:51.431 --> 00:31:53.346
You ever been kissed
in the suburbs?

589
00:31:53.346 --> 00:31:54.347
- No. sir.

590
00:32:12.365 --> 00:32:15.759
I'm Laura Danker.
What's your name?

591
00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.342
God damn it!

592
00:32:33.342 --> 00:32:36.258
Oh. my God. Oh.
my God. Did you lose a finger?

593
00:32:36.258 --> 00:32:40.175
It does say.
"Stop the engine motor

594
00:32:40.175 --> 00:32:42.090
"before cleaning the mower.
unclogging the chute."

595
00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.439
Whose side are you on?

596
00:32:43.439 --> 00:32:44.963
Well. no. you turn off
the motor before you...

597
00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:46.094
I'm fine.

598
00:32:46.094 --> 00:32:47.791
You have to
turn the motor off. Dad.

599
00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.889
<i>Well. time for
Boy Books. everyone.</i>

600
00:32:59.629 --> 00:33:00.717
Who wants to go first?

601
00:33:00.717 --> 00:33:02.067
Like it matters.

602
00:33:02.067 --> 00:33:04.286
We all already know
who everyone put down.

603
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.072
Philip Leroy!

604
00:33:07.072 --> 00:33:08.508
He's so cute.

605
00:33:08.508 --> 00:33:09.900
It's been the same
since second grade.

606
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.250
Well. he looks
better this year.

607
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:12.860
Really?
- Yes. He must have gone

608
00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.253
- to the beach or something.
- He doesn't look

609
00:33:14.253 --> 00:33:16.255
- any different.
- Who'd you put down. Margaret?

610
00:33:16.255 --> 00:33:19.040
- Yeah. I put him. too.

611
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.476
All right. well.
that was quick.

612
00:33:20.476 --> 00:33:24.176
Now it's time to check
for the bras.

613
00:33:24.176 --> 00:33:25.873
- Gretchen has a bra.

614
00:33:25.873 --> 00:33:27.353
Janie has a bra.

615
00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.138
Margaret has a bra. Huh.

616
00:33:30.138 --> 00:33:31.835
Now. let's go around
and tell our sizes.

617
00:33:31.835 --> 00:33:35.491
Well. mine didn't say
it had a size.

618
00:33:35.491 --> 00:33:37.450
It just said it was a Gro-Bra.

619
00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.147
Yeah. I got that one. too.

620
00:33:39.147 --> 00:33:40.540
Oh. same here.

621
00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.932
Well. not me.

622
00:33:41.932 --> 00:33:43.412
I'm a 32. double-A.

623
00:33:45.327 --> 00:33:47.416
If you want to get out
of those small bras.

624
00:33:47.416 --> 00:33:48.548
you're going to have to do

625
00:33:48.548 --> 00:33:50.202
the same exercising
technique I do.

626
00:33:50.202 --> 00:33:52.682
- There's an exercise?
Of course there is.

627
00:33:52.682 --> 00:33:54.293
You hold your arms
out like this

628
00:33:54.293 --> 00:33:58.036
and you say. "I must. I must.
I must increase my bust.

629
00:33:58.036 --> 00:34:01.169
"I must. I must.
I must increase my bust."

630
00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:03.693
- Does that really work?
- I'm living proof.

631
00:34:03.693 --> 00:34:06.609
Now come on. get up.
Get up! Get up! Get up!

632
00:34:06.609 --> 00:34:08.829
You'll see. Get up.

633
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:12.006
I must. I must.
I must increase my bust.

634
00:34:12.006 --> 00:34:14.269
I must.
I must increase my bust.

635
00:34:14.269 --> 00:34:15.705
Chin up!

636
00:34:15.705 --> 00:34:19.231
We must. we must.
we must increase our bust.

637
00:34:19.231 --> 00:34:23.191
We must. we must.
we must increase our bust.

638
00:34:23.191 --> 00:34:24.758
"We must. we must.

639
00:34:24.758 --> 00:34:27.065
-"we must increase our bust."

640
00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:29.371
Shut up! You're so stupid!

641
00:34:29.371 --> 00:34:30.503
- Shut up!
I can feel it working!

642
00:34:30.503 --> 00:34:32.374
Mom!

643
00:34:33.984 --> 00:34:35.203
Grandma said
she'll pick you up

644
00:34:35.203 --> 00:34:36.335
right where you pull in.

645
00:34:36.335 --> 00:34:37.684
- Yes.
- I don't want you to talk to

646
00:34:37.684 --> 00:34:38.772
anybody on the bus.

647
00:34:38.772 --> 00:34:39.990
- Especially men.
- Right.

648
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:41.209
And you find a nice seat
by yourself...

649
00:34:41.209 --> 00:34:43.081
- Okay. Okay. Dad.
- ...by the bus driver.

650
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:44.604
Um. excuse me. sir.
this young lady.

651
00:34:44.604 --> 00:34:46.258
she's traveling
by herself today

652
00:34:46.258 --> 00:34:47.476
and I was just wondering if
you could keep an eye on her?

653
00:34:47.476 --> 00:34:48.608
Sure. lady.
- Mom. come on.

654
00:34:48.608 --> 00:34:49.739
Okay. good bye. Good bye.

655
00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:51.001
- It's going to be fun. Bye.
- Bye!

656
00:34:51.741 --> 00:34:52.829
- Okay. Have fun.
- See ya.

657
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:54.353
Right there. right there!

658
00:34:56.398 --> 00:34:57.704
Good.
There you go.

659
00:34:57.704 --> 00:35:00.141

660
00:35:01.708 --> 00:35:03.797
<i>Are you there. God?
It's me. Margaret.</i>

661
00:35:03.797 --> 00:35:07.105
<i>I'm a little nervous.
actually. about being alone.</i>

662
00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:08.628
<i>so can you just</i>

663
00:35:08.628 --> 00:35:10.456
<i>not let anything
really horrible happen?</i>

664
00:35:12.197 --> 00:35:14.851
<i>Oh. good. That makes me feel
a little better.</i>

665
00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.988
<i>You know. maybe I will do
my school project on religion.</i>

666
00:35:22.729 --> 00:35:26.428
<i>I think it's finally time
for me to decide
what to be. God.</i>

667

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:39.545
And then. some ladies

696
00:36:39.545 --> 00:36:41.286
put gloves on
over that to sleep in.

697
00:36:41.286 --> 00:36:43.288
- You know why?
-  No.

698
00:36:43.288 --> 00:36:45.681
Okay. You have to promise
not to tell anybody this.

699
00:36:45.681 --> 00:36:46.813
what I'm going to
tell you now.

700
00:36:46.813 --> 00:36:49.294
- Okay? Okay. swear?
- Okay. I swear.

701
00:36:49.294 --> 00:36:50.686
So. I actually did this.

702
00:36:50.686 --> 00:36:52.166
I got a really
fabulous hand cream

703
00:36:52.166 --> 00:36:53.602
and I bought these
white gloves

704
00:36:53.602 --> 00:36:55.038
- and I put them on. All right.
- Oh!

705
00:36:55.038 --> 00:36:57.040
No. I did. I did. And so.
I'm lying there. like.

706
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.346
I must've been asleep.

707
00:36:58.346 --> 00:36:59.608
and you know.
and I must've gone like this

708
00:36:59.608 --> 00:37:01.958
and I was. like.
"Ah! Who's in here?"

709
00:37:01.958 --> 00:37:04.918
Because I couldn't
feel my own hands.

710
00:37:06.485 --> 00:37:08.226
- I was frightened.

711
00:37:10.402 --> 00:37:15.015
Oh. God. You are a fab...
I had the best time tonight.

712
00:37:15.015 --> 00:37:17.670
- It was amazing.
- You are a great date. toots.

713
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.454
Oh. my gosh. You are.

714
00:37:19.454 --> 00:37:22.675
Lordy. Lordy.

715
00:37:22.675 --> 00:37:25.199
Before I forget.
if you hear. like. a

716
00:37:25.199 --> 00:37:26.809
or a
it's not me.

717
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.203
Okay? You're just dreaming

718
00:37:29.203 --> 00:37:31.074
and you're dreaming.
All right?

719
00:37:31.074 --> 00:37:33.163
Okay. Sweet dreams.

720
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.435
Hey. Grandma.

721
00:37:44.044 --> 00:37:45.306
Yeah. sugar.

722
00:37:46.916 --> 00:37:49.179
Do you think maybe I could go

723
00:37:49.179 --> 00:37:50.790
to the temple
with you sometime?

724
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:53.358
You bet you can.

725
00:37:54.315 --> 00:37:56.012
Really? Really?

726
00:37:56.622 --> 00:37:58.188
Yeah.

727
00:37:58.188 --> 00:38:01.235
We'll go in the morning.
I got to find what to wear.

728
00:38:02.584 --> 00:38:04.673
Welcome.

729
00:38:04.673 --> 00:38:07.720
- Welcome.

My granddaughter.
My granddaughter.

732
00:38:16.511 --> 00:38:19.122
There's the rabbi.
He's the best in the city.

733
00:38:19.122 --> 00:38:21.211
Two hours. in and out.
bing. bang. boom.

734
00:38:22.212 --> 00:38:23.823
Welcome. dear friends.

735
00:38:23.823 --> 00:38:25.215

"peace and harmony."
and other stuff.

740
00:38:32.179 --> 00:38:33.746
...in thanks to God
this morning.

741
00:38:33.746 --> 00:38:38.098
We open our prayer books
and we turn to page 26.

742
00:39:09.434 --> 00:39:10.739
Agree to the terms

743
00:39:10.739 --> 00:39:12.698

Oh!

747
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.663

A feeling. maybe?</i>

753
00:39:39.551 --> 00:39:41.857
I can't believe
that she took you to temple

754
00:39:41.857 --> 00:39:43.163
without even asking us.

755
00:39:43.163 --> 00:39:44.512
I'm honestly surprised
it took her so long.

756
00:39:44.512 --> 00:39:46.732
I told you guys
that it was my idea.

757
00:39:46.732 --> 00:39:48.734
I just wanted to try it out.

758
00:39:48.734 --> 00:39:50.997
I'm going to try church. too.
Mom. so don't freak out.

759
00:39:50.997 --> 00:39:52.085
I don't care about church.

760
00:39:52.085 --> 00:39:53.652
I don't want you
to go to church.

761
00:39:53.652 --> 00:39:55.697
I don't think you should be
bothering yourself

762
00:39:55.697 --> 00:39:57.351
with any of this stuff
right now.

763
00:39:57.351 --> 00:39:59.266
You said that I can choose my
own religion when I grow up.

764
00:39:59.266 --> 00:40:01.529
Yeah. when you grow up.
When you're an adult.

765
00:40:01.529 --> 00:40:03.009
I'm almost 12.

766
00:40:03.009 --> 00:40:05.403
- That's almost an adult.
-  Honey. no.

767
00:40:06.969 --> 00:40:09.494
- Margaret.  Honey.

768
00:40:10.233 --> 00:40:11.670
I shouldn't have laughed.

769
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:14.020
- It was funny.
- I just...

770
00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.717
I don't want her to go through
any of it.

771
00:40:15.717 --> 00:40:18.416
I don't either. But it might
not be the worst thing.

772
00:40:19.765 --> 00:40:20.896
Think about it.

773
00:40:20.896 --> 00:40:22.420
What does that mean?

774
00:40:22.898 --> 00:40:23.943
Well...

775
00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:27.381
she'll go to a couple of
endless services

776
00:40:27.381 --> 00:40:28.817
and then. she'll realize
how lucky she was

777
00:40:28.817 --> 00:40:29.992
we never made her go.

778
00:40:31.124 --> 00:40:32.995
Know what got me off
going to temple?

779
00:40:32.995 --> 00:40:35.128
- What?
- Going to temple.

780
00:40:35.128 --> 00:40:36.477
You don't understand
a word they're saying.

781
00:40:36.477 --> 00:40:37.783
And you sit there
for a long time.

782
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:41.264
Oh. honey. Oh.

783
00:40:41.264 --> 00:40:43.092
- What?
- I am so sorry. I am...

784
00:40:43.092 --> 00:40:44.790
- What?
- I swear I'm going to

785
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.531
buy the furniture.

786
00:40:46.531 --> 00:40:48.010
This is all I need.

787
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:49.229
Look at it. And look...

788
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.059
Oh. God!

789
00:40:54.103 --> 00:40:56.279
Find me a couch
that does this.

790
00:40:56.279 --> 00:40:58.107
- Okay?

791
00:41:00.675 --> 00:41:03.243
You know how ugly the ceiling
in our gymnasium is?

792
00:41:03.243 --> 00:41:04.810
- It is.
- Yes. it is.

793
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:08.596
We'll have it refinished.
paint it completely black

794
00:41:08.596 --> 00:41:12.034
and then we'll cut out
little stars

795
00:41:13.209 --> 00:41:15.647
and recreate the night sky.

796
00:41:16.952 --> 00:41:18.345
- Oh. that's sweet.
- How lovely.

797
00:41:18.345 --> 00:41:20.521
So how many stars
would we need?

798
00:41:21.653 --> 00:41:24.220
Oh. I was thinking five
or 10.000.

799
00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:27.789
It shouldn't take us long.

800
00:41:27.789 --> 00:41:29.574
I've got some
scissors right here.

801
00:41:29.574 --> 00:41:32.011
Okay.

802
00:41:33.055 --> 00:41:34.448
Promenade right.

803
00:41:37.059 --> 00:41:39.235
Now. single file.

804
00:41:42.543 --> 00:41:44.980
And that's it. Yeah!

805
00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.416
- All right. great.

806
00:41:46.416 --> 00:41:48.462
It's the effort that counts.
Have a good evening.

807
00:41:48.462 --> 00:41:50.856
- I'm so glad this is done.
- Yeah. that sucked.

808
00:41:50.856 --> 00:41:52.205
- It took forever.
- Norman's horrible.

809
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.993
Guys.
Gretchen got the book.

810
00:41:57.993 --> 00:42:00.300
-  What book?
You know...

811
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.998
My dad's anatomy book
that I told you about?

812
00:42:09.875 --> 00:42:12.617
It looks like a thumb.

813
00:42:12.617 --> 00:42:14.749
- What?

814
00:42:18.144 --> 00:42:20.363
- Oh.
- It's so saggy.

815
00:42:21.669 --> 00:42:23.715
It's a wobbly blob.

816
00:42:23.715 --> 00:42:25.804
My brother's looks like that.

817
00:42:26.979 --> 00:42:28.328
- Ew.
- How do you know?

818
00:42:28.328 --> 00:42:29.677
He walks around naked.
I see it.

819
00:42:29.677 --> 00:42:31.113
It's not a pleasant sight.

820
00:42:31.113 --> 00:42:32.375
I never want to see
anyone naked.

821
00:42:32.375 --> 00:42:33.463
or have anyone see me naked.

822
00:42:33.463 --> 00:42:34.769
It's just gross.

823
00:42:34.769 --> 00:42:36.423
Come on. What about
when you get married?

824
00:42:36.423 --> 00:42:37.990
Especially then.

825
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:40.470
Janie. once you grow a little.

826
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:42.385
you'll want the whole world
to see you.

827
00:42:42.385 --> 00:42:44.257
Just like the girls
in <i>Playboy.</i>

828

- Where would I see it?

831

00:42:54.789 --> 00:42:58.097
Wait. So you have a copy here.

833
00:42:58.097 --> 00:42:59.751
Well. I don't know
where it is.

834
00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:01.100
Of course you know
where it is.

835

00:46:01.497 --> 00:46:02.760
Norman Fisher?

869
00:46:04.065 --> 00:46:05.501
<i>So.
who's Norman Fisher?</i>

870
00:46:05.501 --> 00:46:07.939
This weird kid in my class.

871
00:46:07.939 --> 00:46:09.418
I don't even know
why he invited me.

872
00:46:09.418 --> 00:46:10.724
I barely know him.

873
00:46:15.555 --> 00:46:17.339
- Hello?
- Did you get invited

874
00:46:17.339 --> 00:46:19.211
to stupid Norman Fisher's
birthday party?

875
00:46:19.211 --> 00:46:20.429
Yeah. You did. too?

876
00:46:20.429 --> 00:46:21.953
Everyone did. The whole class.

877
00:46:21.953 --> 00:46:24.129
Janie. Gretchen. everyone.
Even Philip Leroy.

878
00:46:24.129 --> 00:46:26.958
- Even Laura Danker?
<i>- I said everybody.</i>

879
00:46:26.958 --> 00:46:29.264
<i>Anyways. my mom
talked to Norman's mom</i>

880
00:46:29.264 --> 00:46:30.788
and I guess it's
a big deal dinner party.

881
00:46:30.788 --> 00:46:32.790
We have to look
extremely nice.

882
00:46:40.623 --> 00:46:41.668
Ow!

883
00:46:41.668 --> 00:46:43.191
Ready? Lean on back.

884
00:46:45.628 --> 00:46:46.760
No. No. no. no.

885
00:46:47.935 --> 00:46:49.676
Where are my shoes?

886
00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.721
Oh. my God!

887
00:46:55.377 --> 00:46:56.378
Mom!

888
00:47:00.034 --> 00:47:01.340
JANIE'S MOTHER: There we go.

889
00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:04.038
Oh. this is gonna look
so pre... Stop moving!

890
00:47:08.086 --> 00:47:11.437
- We are done.
- Yes!

891
00:47:11.437 --> 00:47:12.960
Okay. we're done.
Come on. Mom.

892
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.179
Perfect. One more
for your body. One more.

893
00:47:14.179 --> 00:47:16.137
Okay. let's go. Mom. no!

894
00:47:16.137 --> 00:47:18.618
Okay. Wait.
One more time. Please.

895
00:47:18.618 --> 00:47:20.185
I'm going
to get these printed.

896
00:47:20.185 --> 00:47:21.839
- It's weird.
- Okay. here. Just push them...

897
00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:23.449
Lick them with your fingers
and stick it back.

898
00:47:23.449 --> 00:47:24.580
You got to go. you got to go.

899
00:47:27.322 --> 00:47:29.150
Bye! Thank you. Jan.

900
00:47:31.674 --> 00:47:32.937
My God.

901
00:47:32.937 --> 00:47:34.242
I am so excited
for all of us to do this.

902
00:47:39.813 --> 00:47:40.988
All right. I'll just. um...

903
00:47:40.988 --> 00:47:42.947
- Just. just...
- NORMAN'S MOTHER: Okay.

904
00:47:42.947 --> 00:47:45.819
I'll just... Yeah. okay.
Have fun.

905
00:48:02.923 --> 00:48:04.098
He's hilarious.

906
00:48:10.539 --> 00:48:11.758
How come she never
talks to anybody?

907
00:48:11.758 --> 00:48:13.281
I don't know.

908
00:48:13.281 --> 00:48:15.631
Because she's too busy
doing other stuff. that's why.

909
00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:20.288
Now. if everybody's
had enough to eat.

910
00:48:20.288 --> 00:48:23.552
we can start the games.

911
00:48:23.552 --> 00:48:24.902
The games?

912
00:48:29.819 --> 00:48:31.038
I'll spin first.

913
00:48:44.878 --> 00:48:46.924
Ooh!

914
00:48:56.672 --> 00:48:59.240
Okay. Now.
it's Janie's turn to spin.

915
00:49:08.162 --> 00:49:10.599
- This is a great party.
- Do we have to play this game?

916
00:49:10.599 --> 00:49:13.341
Well then. let's play
a different game. huh?

917
00:49:13.341 --> 00:49:16.083
I have one. It's called
Two Minutes in the Closet.

918
00:49:16.605 --> 00:49:17.737
What's that?

919
00:49:17.737 --> 00:49:19.217
Well. we all get a number.

920
00:49:19.217 --> 00:49:22.046
and then somebody will
call out. like. number six

921
00:49:22.046 --> 00:49:23.221
and then those two

922
00:49:23.221 --> 00:49:25.310
will go into the closet
and. you know...

923
00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:27.225
Ooh!

924
00:49:31.838 --> 00:49:33.448
Number three.

925
00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:38.758
Who's number three?

926
00:49:38.758 --> 00:49:40.978
Somebody's got to be
number three.

927
00:49:49.725 --> 00:49:51.423
Go ahead. Into the bathroom.

928
00:49:51.423 --> 00:49:53.773
Somebody get Freddy
a step stool.

929
00:50:04.566 --> 00:50:05.828
What do you think
they're doing?

930
00:50:05.828 --> 00:50:07.961
- I'm sorry.

931
00:50:11.182 --> 00:50:14.620
Ooh!

932
00:50:16.187 --> 00:50:17.275
You're next.

933
00:50:20.147 --> 00:50:24.630
I pick number... 12.

934
00:50:31.811 --> 00:50:32.812
What?

935
00:50:33.639 --> 00:50:34.640
You're 12?

936
00:50:37.164 --> 00:50:39.427
Ooh!

937
00:50:50.308 --> 00:50:51.526
Nice.

938
00:50:52.266 --> 00:50:53.267
Sorry.

939
00:51:19.728 --> 00:51:21.904
Margaret. turn around.

940
00:51:31.871 --> 00:51:32.915
Um...

941
00:51:33.655 --> 00:51:34.700
So...

942
00:51:36.571 --> 00:51:37.659
Hi.

943
00:51:38.356 --> 00:51:39.357
Hey.

944
00:51:41.185 --> 00:51:42.142
So...

945
00:52:13.391 --> 00:52:15.132
So. the kiss
was really good?

946
00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:18.570
They were
pretty good kisses. Yeah.

947
00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:21.747
Kisses? He kissed you
more than once?

948
00:52:23.009 --> 00:52:24.750
Like. how many times?

949
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:26.273
About five. I think.

950
00:52:27.448 --> 00:52:29.581
I don't know.
I think I lost count.

951
00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:33.933
<i>I know I shouldn't be
enjoying this. God.</i>

952
00:52:33.933 --> 00:52:36.675
<i>but it's just too good.</i>

953
00:52:36.675 --> 00:52:38.851
<i>Sorry. sorry.
I'm going to focus.</i>

954
00:52:43.421 --> 00:52:45.771
The Book of Isaiah.
chapter nine.

955
00:52:45.771 --> 00:52:47.512
verses six and seven says.

956
00:52:47.512 --> 00:52:52.908
"For unto us a child is born.
Unto us. a son is given

957
00:52:52.908 --> 00:52:55.520
"and he will be called
Wonderful Counselor.

958
00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.045
"Mighty God.
Everlasting Father"

959
00:52:59.045 --> 00:53:01.352
<i>If only you could
give me a hint. God.</i>

960
00:53:03.005 --> 00:53:04.964
<i>I'm more confused than ever.</i>

961
00:53:06.357 --> 00:53:08.054
<i>Which religion should I be?</i>

962
00:53:09.969 --> 00:53:11.449
<i>Sometimes I just wish
I'd been born</i>

963
00:53:11.449 --> 00:53:12.711
<i>one way or the other.</i>

964
00:53:40.304 --> 00:53:42.001
Hi. there.
This is Barbara calling.

965
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:44.046
from Delano Elementary School.

966
00:53:44.046 --> 00:53:47.180
And we're just
looking for. uh... donations.

967
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:49.356
Sorry.

968
00:53:49.356 --> 00:53:52.272
Oh. God. I didn't realize
it was dinner.

969
00:53:53.099 --> 00:53:55.101
Okay. Bye-bye.

970
00:54:17.297 --> 00:54:18.255
Hi.

971
00:54:26.654 --> 00:54:27.655
Don't go. don't go. don't go.

972
00:54:29.701 --> 00:54:32.530
I can't believe
you're still there. Okay.

973
00:54:37.709 --> 00:54:38.710
Okay.

974
00:54:50.287 --> 00:54:51.418
No.

975
00:54:56.728 --> 00:54:57.903
Jan.

976
00:54:57.903 --> 00:55:00.340
I just popped by
to pick up your stars.

977
00:55:00.949 --> 00:55:03.778
Yes. Um...

978
00:55:03.778 --> 00:55:06.607
Uh. I've been cleaning.
Come on in.

979
00:55:06.607 --> 00:55:10.916
Um. I'll just.
uh. get the stars.

980
00:55:10.916 --> 00:55:14.615
Um. they're.
they're almost. uh. ready.

981
00:55:16.269 --> 00:55:19.446
You know.
I ordered furniture and. um.

982
00:55:19.446 --> 00:55:21.709
- they still haven't sent it.
- Oh. my gosh.

983
00:55:21.709 --> 00:55:23.494
So crazy. Okay. stars. Um...

984
00:55:23.494 --> 00:55:25.800
Stars. Stars. Stars.

985
00:55:28.063 --> 00:55:29.456
Thank you.

986
00:55:29.456 --> 00:55:31.415
Oh. and don't say anything.

987
00:55:31.415 --> 00:55:34.461
but Deb's stars
are a little lopsided.

988
00:55:34.461 --> 00:55:35.723
Oh.

989
00:55:35.723 --> 00:55:37.595
You know. yours are so good.

990
00:55:37.595 --> 00:55:38.900
Thank you.

991
00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:41.207
You think you could do
her allotment. too?

992
00:55:41.207 --> 00:55:43.078
Just between the two of us?

993
00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:46.430
Sure... Yes.

994
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:49.694
Ah. Thank you.
You are such a doll.

995
00:55:49.694 --> 00:55:53.785
Well. I better get going.
There's lots to do still.

996
00:55:53.785 --> 00:55:55.439
- I'll get the door there.
- Thank you.

997
00:55:55.439 --> 00:55:57.092
Okay.

998
00:55:57.092 --> 00:55:58.659
Okay. bye.
Thank you for these.

999
00:55:58.659 --> 00:56:00.357
Bye. Jan. Sure. anytime.

1000
00:56:12.673 --> 00:56:13.631
Hello. girls.

1001
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.676
I'm Mrs. Webster.

1002
00:56:15.676 --> 00:56:17.461
And I am here
to speak to you today

1003
00:56:17.461 --> 00:56:18.940
about your changing bodies.

1004
00:56:21.465 --> 00:56:24.555
Told you this was
the big sex movie.

1005
00:56:24.555 --> 00:56:25.860
Some of you may have

1006
00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:28.994
already begun
to experience these changes.

1007
00:56:28.994 --> 00:56:31.388
While others of you still
haven't experienced

1008
00:56:31.388 --> 00:56:33.346
a single change at all.

1009
00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:36.393
We're going to watch
a short film

1010
00:56:36.393 --> 00:56:38.177
to learn a little bit more.

1011
00:56:53.018 --> 00:56:54.585
<i>All girls are unique.</i>

1012
00:56:54.585 --> 00:56:57.892
<i>But sometime. between the ages
of nine and 16</i>

1013
00:56:57.892 --> 00:57:00.939
<i>one very special thing
happens to every girl.</i>

1014
00:57:00.939 --> 00:57:02.506
<i>menstruation.</i>

1015
00:57:04.203 --> 00:57:07.641
<i>Once a month. a velvety lining
of blood and tissue</i>

1016
00:57:07.641 --> 00:57:09.861
<i>forms in her uterus
to make a warm.</i>

1017
00:57:09.861 --> 00:57:13.430
<i>nutritious place
for a baby to grow.</i>

1018
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:17.825
<i>If a baby is not conceived.
the lining is not needed.</i>

1019
00:57:17.825 --> 00:57:21.612
<i>And so. the blood is released
through the vagina.</i>

1020
00:57:21.612 --> 00:57:24.528
<i>That's menstruation.</i>

1021
00:57:24.528 --> 00:57:26.399
Who do you think
will get it first?

1022
00:57:26.399 --> 00:57:28.183
Who do you think
will get it last?

1023
00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:32.492
I honestly don't know
what's taking me so long

1024
00:57:32.492 --> 00:57:34.407
to get this dumb furniture.

1025
00:57:34.407 --> 00:57:36.235
I guess I just want our house
to look like one of those

1026
00:57:36.235 --> 00:57:38.498
nice little houses
nice little families have.

1027
00:57:40.413 --> 00:57:41.762
Do you like these egg chairs?

1028
00:57:41.762 --> 00:57:43.590
When did you get your period?

1029
00:57:45.679 --> 00:57:46.724
Um...

1030
00:57:46.724 --> 00:57:48.334
Just tell me how old you were.

1031
00:57:48.334 --> 00:57:51.903
I... I think I was 14?

1032
00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:54.601
That late?

1033
00:57:54.601 --> 00:57:55.950
That's not late. actually.

1034
00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:57.996
I mean. I had a cousin
who was 16.

1035
00:57:57.996 --> 00:58:00.389
Sixteen? Oh. my God.

1036
00:58:00.389 --> 00:58:03.088
I'd...
I'd die if I didn't get it

1037
00:58:03.088 --> 00:58:04.568
before I was 16.

1038
00:58:04.568 --> 00:58:06.352
Honey. you will get it

1039
00:58:06.352 --> 00:58:08.789
exactly when
you're supposed to get it.

1040
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:09.877
Don't worry about it.

1041
00:58:12.576 --> 00:58:14.055
My mom got me
Radio City tickets

1042
00:58:14.055 --> 00:58:15.970
since I got all straight A's.

1043
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:18.103
Um. does anybody want to come?

1044
00:58:18.103 --> 00:58:20.148
Only bad thing is. is my
brother and Moose are coming.

1045
00:58:20.148 --> 00:58:21.976
- Oh. I'll go.
- Okay.

1046
00:58:24.326 --> 00:58:25.327
I got it.

1047
00:58:26.285 --> 00:58:27.329
Got what?

1048
00:58:28.243 --> 00:58:29.680
My period.

1049
00:58:32.378 --> 00:58:34.467
I just don't really understand
how you got it first

1050
00:58:34.467 --> 00:58:35.860
when I have way more than you.

1051
00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:37.426
Well. that doesn't
mean anything.

1052
00:58:37.426 --> 00:58:38.950
- Yes. it does. Gretchen.
- Okay. just tell us

1053
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:41.256
- how it happened.
- Start from
the very beginning.

1054
00:58:42.954 --> 00:58:46.784
Well. I was sitting there
at dinner

1055
00:58:46.784 --> 00:58:48.394
eating my meatloaf

1056
00:58:48.394 --> 00:58:50.657
and I felt something
coming out of me.

1057
00:58:51.484 --> 00:58:53.268
So I went to the bathroom.

1058
00:58:53.268 --> 00:58:56.968
pulled down my pants and
that's when I saw the blood.

1059
00:58:58.926 --> 00:59:00.362
So I called my mom

1060
00:59:00.362 --> 00:59:01.712
and I showed her.

1061
00:59:01.712 --> 00:59:03.757
And  she got some

1062
00:59:03.757 --> 00:59:06.586
"sanitary napkins."
as she calls them.

1063
00:59:06.586 --> 00:59:08.370
I put one on and...

1064
00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:11.852
Well. that's the whole thing.

1065
00:59:14.289 --> 00:59:16.901
That's the whole thing?
Just that?

1066
00:59:16.901 --> 00:59:18.511
- I told you everything.
No.

1067
00:59:18.511 --> 00:59:20.687
There has to be
something more.

1068
00:59:20.687 --> 00:59:23.081
My sister said
that it kinda has a smell.

1069
00:59:23.081 --> 00:59:24.952
But I haven't
noticed that yet.

1070
00:59:24.952 --> 00:59:26.867
A smell? Like what?

1071
00:59:26.867 --> 00:59:29.435
She said it kinda smells
like the monkey bars.

1072
00:59:29.435 --> 00:59:32.090
- The monkey bars? Ugh.
Yeah.

1073
00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:34.309
I used to love
the monkey bars.

1074
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:38.400
But do you feel older now?
Like more mature?

1075
00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.880
Oh. yeah.

1076
00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.839
I don't know how to explain it

1077
00:59:41.839 --> 00:59:43.797
and you won't understand it
till you get it.

1078
00:59:43.797 --> 00:59:46.931
but I feel like
everything's changed.

1079
00:59:46.931 --> 00:59:48.193
Are you there. God?
It's me. Margaret.

1080
00:59:48.193 --> 00:59:49.716
I've never been
so jealous my entire life

1081
00:59:49.716 --> 00:59:50.935
and I hate myself
for being jealous.

1082
00:59:50.935 --> 00:59:53.241
Just please.
please just let me grow

1083
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:54.765
and let me get my period.

1084
00:59:54.765 --> 00:59:56.549
Let me just be normal
and regular like everybody else.

1085
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:57.724
Just please. please.

1086
00:59:57.724 --> 00:59:59.160
please. please. please.
please. please!

1087
01:00:02.337 --> 01:00:03.948
Amen.

1088
01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:07.734
I don't know
if I want to do this.

1089
01:00:07.734 --> 01:00:10.084
It's fine.
It's just so that we're ready.

1090
01:00:10.868 --> 01:00:12.130
Just in case.

1091
01:00:19.485 --> 01:00:20.486
Come on.

1092
01:00:21.574 --> 01:00:22.749
Okay.

1093
01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:28.929
Next in line. please.

1094
01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.149
Please. God. let it be a lady.

1095
01:00:32.585 --> 01:00:33.673
Please.

1096
01:00:34.413 --> 01:00:36.154
Thank you.

1097
01:00:39.461 --> 01:00:41.463
- Hey. there.
Hey.

1098
01:00:41.463 --> 01:00:43.030
- No...
- Let's just put them back.

1099
01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:45.467
No. come on. Come on.

1100
01:01:17.804 --> 01:01:18.936
- Oh. my God!
- Oh!

1101
01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:26.378
- The Tic Tacs!

1102
01:01:27.945 --> 01:01:29.947
- Why the Tic Tacs?
- I don't know.

1103
01:01:29.947 --> 01:01:32.340
- Everything worked out.
- Oh. man.

1104
01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:20.084
- Uh. come in.

1105
01:02:23.348 --> 01:02:24.436

Uh. you've got a postcard.

1107
01:02:26.438 --> 01:02:29.571
- Oh. Thanks.
- Who's in D.C.?

1108
01:02:29.571 --> 01:02:33.532
Uh. Nancy. Uh. they went
for President's Day.

1109
01:02:34.315 --> 01:02:35.664
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1110
01:02:35.664 --> 01:02:37.623
Okay.

1111
01:02:37.623 --> 01:02:39.930
- You want the door closed?
- Yeah. Sure.

1112
01:02:45.892 --> 01:02:47.024
"I got it"?

1113
01:02:50.897 --> 01:02:52.638
Oh. come on!

1114
01:03:04.302 --> 01:03:08.262
Hello? Simon residence.

[ON PHONE] <i>Grandma?</i>

1116
01:03:10.134 --> 01:03:12.789
Margaret? What's wrong?

1117
01:03:13.702 --> 01:03:15.095
I just really miss you.

1118
01:03:15.574 --> 01:03:16.575
<i>Oh. honey.</i>

1119
01:03:16.967 --> 01:03:18.490
Me. too.

1120
01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:20.884
<i>I'll be back next week
to see the Rockettes and...</i>

1121
01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:22.929
maybe could I come down

1122
01:03:22.929 --> 01:03:24.931
and stay the night
like we did last time?

1123
01:03:24.931 --> 01:03:26.628
<i>Oh. sweetheart.</i>

1124
01:03:26.628 --> 01:03:29.066

01:03:29.675 --> 01:03:30.676
<i>Well...</i>

1126
01:03:33.766 --> 01:03:35.855
I'm going to be
in Florida then.

1127
01:03:35.855 --> 01:03:38.684
<i>I. uh. I heard about
this hotel</i>

1128
01:03:38.684 --> 01:03:42.122

Um. okay.

1130
01:03:44.516 --> 01:03:46.779
Wait a minute. Wait. Um...

1131
01:03:47.954 --> 01:03:50.261
What if you
fly down to Florida

1132
01:03:50.261 --> 01:03:52.045
and spend a few days with me?

1133
01:03:52.045 --> 01:03:55.179
<i>- Isn't your spring break soon?</i>
- Yeah. The end of April.

1134
01:03:55.179 --> 01:03:57.268
Perfect! I'll still be there.

1135
01:03:57.268 --> 01:03:58.617
I'll ask Mom and Dad.

1136
01:03:58.617 --> 01:04:00.488
Oh. great!

1137
01:04:00.488 --> 01:04:02.926
<i>That's my girl. Bye. darling.</i>

Hi.

1142
01:04:20.726 --> 01:04:21.858

Sorry. Lefty.

1146
01:05:05.336 --> 01:05:06.728
Oh. no. it's okay.

1147
01:05:10.036 --> 01:05:11.559
Do you know if
the waiter's anywhere?

1148
01:05:11.559 --> 01:05:14.475
Oh. You can have mine.
I didn't drink any out of it.

1149
01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:15.999
Thanks.

1150
01:05:17.565 --> 01:05:18.566
Hey.

1151
01:05:21.047 --> 01:05:22.222
Do you know something

1152
01:05:22.222 --> 01:05:23.876
I've always liked
about you. Margaret?

1153
01:05:23.876 --> 01:05:25.312
- No?
- Come with me.

1154
01:05:25.312 --> 01:05:26.792
I got to go to the bathroom.

1155
01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:28.620
We'll be right back.
Don't touch my food.

1156
01:05:31.623 --> 01:05:33.320
You know. I've had to go
since we got here...

1157
01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.541
...and then I drank. like.
three 7Ups or something.

1158
01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:38.151
Uh-huh.

1159
01:05:41.894 --> 01:05:42.939
Oh. no.

She needs you.

1175
01:06:24.241 --> 01:06:25.764
I can't get in.
You have to unlock it.

1176
01:06:25.764 --> 01:06:28.419
- I can't open it. I can't.
- Yes. you can. Nancy.

Hmm? Hey. look at me.
Calm down.

1183
01:06:49.135 --> 01:06:51.877
I can't help you if you don't
stop crying and talk to me.

1184
01:06:55.533 --> 01:06:57.709
Hey. What is it?

1185
01:07:05.934 --> 01:07:09.547
Oh. Well. all right. Um...

01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:12.724
Here. We'll just. uh...

1187
01:07:14.595 --> 01:07:15.988
Margaret?

1188
01:07:15.988 --> 01:07:17.468
Margaret.

1189
01:07:17.468 --> 01:07:21.298
Would you get Nancy
a pad. please

1190
01:07:21.298 --> 01:07:23.604
from the dispenser
on the wall?

1191
01:07:25.432 --> 01:07:27.739
She got her period. sweetie.

1192
01:07:27.739 --> 01:07:30.089
Does she always act like that?

1193
01:07:30.089 --> 01:07:33.179
Well. it's her first time.
She's just a little scared.

1194
01:07:47.019 --> 01:07:48.064
Thank you. sweetie.

1195
01:07:49.543 --> 01:07:50.805
All right. Yeah?

1196
01:07:52.938 --> 01:07:54.026
All right.

1197
01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:57.769
Well. you girls wash up.

1198
01:07:57.769 --> 01:08:00.076
I'm going to go tell
the others not to worry.

1199
01:08:03.601 --> 01:08:06.256
Not too long now. Okay?

1200
01:08:37.504 --> 01:08:40.594
<i>Are you there. God?
It's me. Margaret.</i>

1201
01:08:42.379 --> 01:08:44.120
<i>I don't even know what to say.</i>

1202
01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:06.794
I'm going to Florida?

1203
01:09:07.926 --> 01:09:10.102
- Happy birthday.
- Mom. Thank you so much.

1204
01:09:15.499 --> 01:09:16.500
Hey!

1205
01:09:17.936 --> 01:09:20.025
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

1206
01:09:20.025 --> 01:09:21.679
Why do we have
different seats?

1207
01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:23.811
He said we're in groups
to study different countries.

1208
01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:51.622
Oh. Hey.

1209
01:09:51.622 --> 01:09:54.102
Hey. Happy birthday.

1210
01:09:54.102 --> 01:09:55.191
- Thanks.
- Oh. and. uh.

1211
01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:58.455
- I got you something.
- Ow!

1212
01:09:58.455 --> 01:10:00.283
It's a pinch to grow an inch.

1213
01:10:00.283 --> 01:10:03.503
And you know where
you need that inch. Hey.

1214
01:10:06.724 --> 01:10:09.205
<i>Are you there. God?
It's me. Margaret.</i>

1215
01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:12.469
<i>I hate Philip Leroy.
I hate him.</i>

1216
01:10:12.469 --> 01:10:15.602
<i>I hate Laura Danker. too!
With her big boobs.</i>

1217
01:10:15.602 --> 01:10:18.214
<i>"Ooh. look at me. everybody.
I'm wearing a sweater."</i>

1218
01:10:19.258 --> 01:10:21.956
<i>I hate Nancy. That liar!</i>

1219
01:10:21.956 --> 01:10:23.610
<i>And Norman Fisher.
the way that he reads</i>

1220
01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:26.439
<i>with his stupid lips
flapping everywhere!</i>

1221
01:10:26.439 --> 01:10:30.313
<i>Please. Please. just hurry up
and get me to Florida!</i>

1222
01:10:39.104 --> 01:10:40.453
Philip and Norman
should be here.

1223
01:10:40.453 --> 01:10:42.934
They make us do all the work.

1224
01:10:42.934 --> 01:10:44.805
What time is your mom
picking you up?

1225
01:10:45.719 --> 01:10:47.155
Not till later.

1226
01:10:47.155 --> 01:10:49.027
I have to go to St. Thomas
for Confession first.

1227
01:10:49.027 --> 01:10:51.899
Confession?

1228
01:10:51.899 --> 01:10:53.597
It's just something you have
to do when you're Catholic.

1229
01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:56.034
What do you confess?

1230
01:10:57.775 --> 01:10:58.776
Things.

1231
01:11:00.343 --> 01:11:02.432
What kinds of things?

1232
01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:07.741
Never mind.

1233
01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:18.186
You're just copying straight
out of the <i>World Book.</i>

1234
01:11:18.839 --> 01:11:20.667
It's four words.

1235
01:11:20.667 --> 01:11:23.061
"Germany invaded
Belgium when..."

1236
01:11:23.061 --> 01:11:24.584
So. you're still cheating.

1237
01:11:24.584 --> 01:11:26.456
Mr. Benedict will know
if you're cheating.

1238
01:11:26.456 --> 01:11:28.980
I'm not cheating! Jeez!

1239
01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:34.115
Quit acting like
you know everything

1240
01:11:34.115 --> 01:11:35.378
and you're so great.

1241
01:11:35.378 --> 01:11:37.031
This has nothing to do
with being great.

1242
01:11:37.031 --> 01:11:38.859
I know all about the stuff
that you do.

1243
01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:42.036
What's that supposed to mean?

1244
01:11:42.036 --> 01:11:43.603
I heard about you
and Moose Freed.

1245
01:11:44.648 --> 01:11:46.519
What about me and Moose Freed?

1246
01:11:46.519 --> 01:11:49.217
Oh. how you and Evan and Moose
go behind the A

1247
01:11:49.217 --> 01:11:50.784
And why would I do that?

1248
01:11:50.784 --> 01:11:54.658
I don't know why you do it.
But I know why they do it.

1249
01:11:54.658 --> 01:11:56.660
So they can feel you up
or something and you let them.

1250
01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:57.878
You're a liar. You're lying!

1251
01:11:57.878 --> 01:11:58.966
I'm not lying.

1252
01:11:58.966 --> 01:12:00.446
You're just like Nancy.

1253
01:12:00.446 --> 01:12:03.275
All you do is pick on people
and make up stories.

1254
01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:04.972
You think I don't know
about you and your friends?

1255
01:12:17.637 --> 01:12:19.030
Laura!

1256
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:21.815
Wait. Please! Laura!

1257
01:12:21.815 --> 01:12:24.340
- Wait up. Please!
- You think I don't know

1258
01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.429
that all of you make fun of me
like it's some kind of game?

1259
01:12:26.429 --> 01:12:27.734
- It's not me.
- Do you think I want to be

1260
01:12:27.734 --> 01:12:29.475
the biggest kid in the class?

1261
01:12:29.475 --> 01:12:32.522
How would you feel if you were
to wear a bra in fourth grade

1262
01:12:32.522 --> 01:12:33.610
and everybody called you names

1263
01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:35.220
just because of
how you looked?

1264
01:12:36.308 --> 01:12:37.353
I don't know.

1265
01:12:42.009 --> 01:12:44.360
Hey. wait. I really am sorry.

1266
01:13:02.987 --> 01:13:04.205
Laura?

1267
01:13:06.164 --> 01:13:07.208
Laura.

1268
01:13:24.269 --> 01:13:26.967
<i>I'm the worst person
who ever lived. God.</i>

1269
01:13:26.967 --> 01:13:29.579
<i>I picked on Laura Danker
just because I felt mean.</i>

1270
01:13:31.102 --> 01:13:33.931
<i>I don't want to be like Nancy.</i>

1271
01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:36.760
<i>I don't even know if I want to
be friends with her anymore.</i>

1272
01:13:39.589 --> 01:13:41.155
<i>I've been
looking for you. God.</i>

1273
01:13:43.157 --> 01:13:45.333
<i>I looked for you in Temple.</i>

1274
01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:46.770
<i>I looked for you in Church...</i>

1275
01:13:48.467 --> 01:13:50.034
<i>I didn't feel you at all.</i>

1276
01:13:52.906 --> 01:13:54.430
<i>Why? Why. God?</i>

1277
01:13:56.257 --> 01:13:59.043
<i>Why do I only feel you
when I'm alone?</i>

1278
01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:05.832
Yes. my child.

1279
01:14:05.832 --> 01:14:08.269
Do you have something
you'd like to confess?

1280
01:14:10.228 --> 01:14:11.403
Um...

1281
01:14:17.627 --> 01:14:19.106
I...

1282
01:14:19.106 --> 01:14:21.152
I did something really awful.

1283
01:14:23.328 --> 01:14:24.460
And...

1284
01:14:27.027 --> 01:14:28.333
I'm really sorry.

1285
01:15:00.234 --> 01:15:02.019
<i>"Dear Barbara.</i>

1286
01:15:02.019 --> 01:15:04.325
"your letter felt like
an answer to prayer.

1287
01:15:04.325 --> 01:15:06.676
"Your father and I have been
thinking about you a lot.

1288
01:15:06.676 --> 01:15:09.243
"We're getting older and
suddenly. more than anything.

1289
01:15:09.243 --> 01:15:13.204
"we'd like to see
our only daughter

1290
01:15:13.204 --> 01:15:15.511
"and finally get to know our
granddaughter. Margaret Ann."

1291
01:15:17.556 --> 01:15:18.949
"We're flying east next week.

1292
01:15:18.949 --> 01:15:20.777
"and we sincerely hope
you'll let us visit.

1293
01:15:20.777 --> 01:15:22.779
"Love. your mother.
Mary Hutchins."

1294
01:15:29.742 --> 01:15:31.004
So you sent them a card?

1295
01:15:33.572 --> 01:15:35.008
I don't know why.

1296
01:15:44.757 --> 01:15:45.976
Do you remember
what it was like

1297
01:15:45.976 --> 01:15:47.543
when they just cast you out?

1298
01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.328
Yes.

1299
01:15:50.328 --> 01:15:51.372
Do you?

1300
01:15:52.373 --> 01:15:53.940
Because I remember.

1301
01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:55.115
I know. I know.

1302
01:15:56.203 --> 01:15:58.162
How they treated you
was just...

1303
01:15:59.337 --> 01:16:00.686
- I know.
- How they treated me?

1304
01:16:01.818 --> 01:16:03.863
They think
you're going to hell

1305
01:16:03.863 --> 01:16:05.256
because you married a Jew.

1306
01:16:06.344 --> 01:16:07.563
Think about that.

1307
01:16:08.128 --> 01:16:09.129
I...

1308
01:16:10.217 --> 01:16:11.654
I know.

1309
01:16:11.654 --> 01:16:14.700
Do you really. really want to
open up that door?

1310
01:16:15.527 --> 01:16:16.920
We have a good life.

1311
01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.182
Yes. Yes.

1312
01:16:19.705 --> 01:16:20.663
I...

1313
01:16:22.099 --> 01:16:26.320
But what if this means...
they've changed?

1314
01:16:29.715 --> 01:16:30.716
And if they haven't?

1315
01:16:34.764 --> 01:16:36.330
They're my parents.

1316
01:16:39.029 --> 01:16:40.378
Mmm.

1317
01:16:40.378 --> 01:16:42.206
- The only ones I got.
- They are your parents.

1318
01:16:43.337 --> 01:16:45.470
Oh. God.

1319
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:48.342
Oh. my goodness.

1320
01:16:48.342 --> 01:16:49.387
I'm sorry.

1321
01:16:53.043 --> 01:16:54.087
What's going on?

1322
01:16:54.087 --> 01:16:55.611
Um...

1323
01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:58.048
- Oh.
- Oh. honey. um...

1324
01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:00.485
Uh...

1325
01:17:02.356 --> 01:17:03.836
We got a letter

1326
01:17:03.836 --> 01:17:06.622
from. um. from my parents.
from your grandparents.

1327
01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.493
And they're coming
to visit next week.

1328
01:17:08.493 --> 01:17:10.800
- Next... next week?
Mmm-hmm.

1329
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.584
They're really
excited to meet you.

1330
01:17:12.584 --> 01:17:14.281
I won't be here.
I'll be in Florida.

1331
01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:19.373
I'm still going to Florida.
aren't I?

1332
01:17:19.373 --> 01:17:22.202
- Margaret. look...
- No. What?

1333
01:17:22.202 --> 01:17:24.378
I can't even
go to Florida now?

1334
01:17:24.378 --> 01:17:26.293
Come on. I don't even
want to see them.

1335
01:17:26.293 --> 01:17:27.860
I want to see Grandma.

1336
01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.167
I know. I know and we will
make this up to you.

1337
01:17:30.167 --> 01:17:32.169
I promise. you will go
to Florida.

1338
01:17:32.169 --> 01:17:34.432
- just another time.
- No. I don't want

1339
01:17:34.432 --> 01:17:36.042
to go to Florida another time.

1340
01:17:37.217 --> 01:17:38.784
Does Grandma know about this?

1341
01:17:38.784 --> 01:17:40.481
No. not yet.
We have to call her.

1342
01:17:40.481 --> 01:17:42.658
Well. I'm not doing it.
You can do it yourself.

1343
01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.529
- No. of course. Of course.
Let me handle that.

1344
01:17:44.529 --> 01:17:46.531
- No. I will...
- Please let me call. Please.

1345
01:17:52.624 --> 01:17:55.018
To this beautiful day.

1346
01:17:57.847 --> 01:17:59.109
Just one moment.

1347
01:18:00.153 --> 01:18:01.764
Don't eat all the cheese
without me.

1348
01:18:03.156 --> 01:18:05.593
I'm just kidding.
You eat as much as you want.

1349
01:18:05.593 --> 01:18:07.465
Depending on your cholesterol.

1350
01:18:07.465 --> 01:18:09.554
- I'm sure it's low.

1351
01:18:15.081 --> 01:18:16.300
Simon residence.

1352
01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:17.910
<i>Hi. Mom. Yes. Uh...</i>

1353
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:19.390
Herb?

1354
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:21.044
Uh. Margaret's. uh. plan
to come to Florida next week

1355
01:18:21.044 --> 01:18:22.132
isn't going to work out.

1356
01:18:22.132 --> 01:18:23.133
I'm really sorry.

1357
01:18:24.438 --> 01:18:25.701
<i>Just
give me the phone.</i>

1358
01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:28.181
<i>Hey. Grandma.</i>

1359
01:18:28.181 --> 01:18:30.227
Margaret. what happened?
What's going on?

1360
01:18:30.227 --> 01:18:32.446
We...

1361
01:18:32.446 --> 01:18:35.101
We got a letter that my
other grandparents are coming.

1362
01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.193
<i>And I just
really wanted to see you.</i>

1363
01:18:40.193 --> 01:18:42.108
Put your mother
on the phone right now.

1364
01:18:43.762 --> 01:18:45.459
- Oh. no...
It's okay.

1365
01:18:48.027 --> 01:18:49.202
Sylvia.

1366
01:18:49.202 --> 01:18:50.856
What the hell
is going on. Barbara?

1367
01:18:50.856 --> 01:18:53.903
Sylvia. I'm so very sorry
about this

1368
01:18:53.903 --> 01:18:57.167
and I will try and explain it
another time.

1369
01:18:57.167 --> 01:18:59.125
No. You're going to
explain right now.

1370
01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:00.648
I'm sorry. I have to...
I have to go.

1371
01:19:05.436 --> 01:19:07.873
<i>Are you there. God?
It's me. Margaret.</i>

1372
01:19:07.873 --> 01:19:10.354
<i>- I'm absolutely miserable.</i>
- I am so sorry.

1373
01:19:10.354 --> 01:19:12.660
<i>Everything
is going wrong. Everything.</i>

1374
01:19:13.357 --> 01:19:15.011
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

1375
01:19:15.011 --> 01:19:18.101
<i>Make something happen
so that they don't come</i>

1376
01:19:18.101 --> 01:19:19.929
<i>and I can still go to Florida.</i>

1377
01:19:28.851 --> 01:19:30.417
Please. Margaret.
Even if it's fake.

1378
01:19:30.417 --> 01:19:32.593
can you just look happy?

1379
01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.119
Or at least not so unhappy?

1380
01:19:37.511 --> 01:19:39.600
Why do you
even want to see them?

1381
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.385
After everything
that they did to you?

1382
01:19:43.604 --> 01:19:48.696
Because I want them to see
how great we've done.

1383
01:19:48.696 --> 01:19:51.787
I... And how proud
I am of our family.

1384
01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:58.358
- Hey! Hello.

1385
01:19:59.403 --> 01:20:00.447
That's them.

1386
01:20:01.144 --> 01:20:02.145
Okay.

1387
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.801
Hi!

1388
01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.805
They might hug you.
I don't know.

1389
01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.067
Just be prepared.

1390
01:20:15.245 --> 01:20:16.507
- Hi!
- Hello!

1391
01:20:16.507 --> 01:20:18.596
Hello. It's so nice
to see you.

1392
01:20:18.596 --> 01:20:20.816
Oh. you too. Barbara.

1393
01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:23.993
- Oh.

1394
01:20:29.433 --> 01:20:31.000
- Hi. honey.
- Oh.

1395
01:20:34.917 --> 01:20:37.006
- This must be Margaret Ann.
Mmm-hmm.

1396
01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.141
We're very glad to meet you.

1397
01:20:42.141 --> 01:20:44.578
- Yes. we are. Yes. we are.
- Me. too.

1398
01:20:45.362 --> 01:20:46.450
Um...

1399
01:20:47.668 --> 01:20:49.932
Bags! We'll get the bags.

1400
01:20:49.932 --> 01:20:53.370
Um. Herb is just out. uh.
with the car.

1401
01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:55.546
- Yeah. so... Okay.
Okay.

1402
01:20:55.546 --> 01:20:57.678
Just out here to the right.

1403
01:20:57.678 --> 01:20:59.419
The blue car there. Yep.

1404
01:21:01.421 --> 01:21:03.075
Hey.

1405
01:21:03.075 --> 01:21:04.816
- Youse okay? Yeah?
- Yeah.

1406
01:21:04.816 --> 01:21:06.470
Mom. Dad. you remember Herb?

1407
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:07.732
- Yeah. Hello. Herb.
- Hi.

1408
01:21:07.732 --> 01:21:08.994
- How are you?
- Okay.

1409
01:21:08.994 --> 01:21:10.648
- Hi. Nice to see you.
- Hello.

1410
01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:13.216
Um. should I...
I'll take this for you.

1411
01:21:13.216 --> 01:21:14.304
Oh.

1412
01:21:17.829 --> 01:21:18.874
All right.

1413
01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.136
Okay.

1414
01:21:21.267 --> 01:21:22.355
All right.
Should I put these up?

1415
01:21:22.355 --> 01:21:23.661
Oh. yes. Thank you.

1416
01:21:25.184 --> 01:21:28.884
Here we are.
Make yourselves comfortable.

1417
01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:30.798
- Lovely home.
- Yeah!

1418
01:21:30.798 --> 01:21:33.236
Thank you. Yes. Uh...

1419
01:21:34.237 --> 01:21:35.934
Okay. So. uh. Margaret. uh.

1420
01:21:35.934 --> 01:21:37.153
can you show them
to their room?

1421
01:21:37.153 --> 01:21:39.851
And. um. I'll just
get dinner started.

1422
01:21:39.851 --> 01:21:42.680
Sure. Um. up this way.

1423
01:21:46.727 --> 01:21:49.078
Gosh. you look
just like your mom

1424
01:21:49.078 --> 01:21:50.688
when she was your age.

1425
01:21:50.688 --> 01:21:52.995
Um. yeah. This way.

1426
01:22:00.611 --> 01:22:02.961
-  Hi.
- Hey.

1427
01:22:02.961 --> 01:22:04.223
How are you doing?

1428
01:22:04.223 --> 01:22:06.486
Uh... How are you doing?

1429
01:22:06.486 --> 01:22:08.532
Um. I used up
all my small talk

1430
01:22:08.532 --> 01:22:09.750
- in the car.
- Oh. God.

1431
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:11.927
Do they like sports? TV shows?

1432
01:22:13.841 --> 01:22:15.931
Game shows.
They used to watch game shows.

1433
01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:19.021
- Okay. Game shows. game shows.

1434
01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:20.326
Hmm.

1435
01:22:20.326 --> 01:22:21.849
Um. coming!

1436
01:22:24.635 --> 01:22:25.679
Herb!

1437
01:22:26.506 --> 01:22:27.638
Mom!

1438
01:22:27.638 --> 01:22:29.814
Baby! Come give
your mom a big hug.

1439
01:22:29.814 --> 01:22:31.120
Oh.

1440
01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.904
- Oh. Look at your little face.
- Sylvia?

1441
01:22:32.904 --> 01:22:34.340
Yeah. My mom is here.

1442
01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:35.863
Uh. yes. she is.
What's happening?

1443
01:22:35.863 --> 01:22:37.865
Well. Margaret said
she needed to see me.

1444
01:22:37.865 --> 01:22:39.258
so we flew out from Florida.

1445
01:22:39.258 --> 01:22:40.477
Are your parents here yet?

1446
01:22:40.477 --> 01:22:43.262
Oh. This is Morris Binamin.

1447
01:22:43.262 --> 01:22:45.351
- Rhymes with cinnamon.

1448
01:22:45.351 --> 01:22:47.614
- Hi.
Grandma!

1449
01:22:47.614 --> 01:22:50.530
There's my Margaret!
Oh!

1450
01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:52.532
Did you know?
- I had no... I know.

1451
01:22:52.532 --> 01:22:53.838
I missed you so much!

1452
01:22:53.838 --> 01:22:55.187
I thought
you were in Florida.

1453
01:22:55.187 --> 01:22:57.015
I know. Well.
Florida came to you.

1454
01:22:57.015 --> 01:22:58.451
- Uh...

1455
01:22:58.451 --> 01:23:01.977
Mom. Dad. this is Sylvia.
Herb's mom.

1456
01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:05.893
Sylvia. this... These are
my parents. Paul and Mary.

1457
01:23:05.893 --> 01:23:07.591
Hello.

1458
01:23:07.591 --> 01:23:09.158
- Hello.

1459
01:23:11.943 --> 01:23:13.031
We have pot roast.

1460
01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:14.554
Sure.

1461
01:23:17.427 --> 01:23:18.645
Mmm.

1462
01:23:19.951 --> 01:23:21.344
Mmm.
- Oh. yeah.

1463
01:23:21.344 --> 01:23:23.607
- Dinner is delicious. Barbara.
- Oh. my God. yes.

1464
01:23:23.607 --> 01:23:26.392
- Oh.
- You have definitely improved.

1465
01:23:26.392 --> 01:23:28.481
- It is very nice.
-  Thank you.

1466
01:23:30.657 --> 01:23:35.575
Well. I have to admit
it was a bit of a jolt. um.

1467
01:23:35.575 --> 01:23:39.579
but it's nice to have
everyone here together.

1468
01:23:39.579 --> 01:23:41.103
The whole family.

1469
01:23:43.714 --> 01:23:46.064
- And Mr. Binamin.

1470
01:23:46.064 --> 01:23:47.587
Nice to have you. too.

1471
01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:52.157
<i>- L'chaim.
- L'chaim.</i>

1472
01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:57.554
<i>L'chaim. L'chaim.</i>

1473
01:23:57.554 --> 01:24:00.557
<i>L'chaim. L'chaim. L'chaim.
L'chaim. L'chaim.</i>

1474
01:24:00.557 --> 01:24:02.472
-  To life!

1475
01:24:09.348 --> 01:24:10.784
So. um.
do you watch <i>Jeopardy!?</i>

1476
01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:18.227
I used to braid
your mama's hair

1477
01:24:18.227 --> 01:24:19.402
when she was a little girl.

1478
01:24:19.402 --> 01:24:21.317
Did your mom
ever braid your hair?

1479
01:24:21.317 --> 01:24:24.015
Um. yeah. she used to do it
all the time.

1480
01:24:24.015 --> 01:24:26.800
I can see she taught you how
to braid with your bracelet.

1481
01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:27.932
Yeah.

1482
01:24:27.932 --> 01:24:29.325
Oh. there's just so much

1483
01:24:29.325 --> 01:24:30.935
we want to get to know
about you. Margaret.

1484
01:24:30.935 --> 01:24:32.676
Twelve years is a lot
to catch up on.

1485
01:24:32.676 --> 01:24:33.938
Yeah. A long time.

1486
01:24:34.852 --> 01:24:37.072
So. uh. we were wondering...

1487
01:24:38.856 --> 01:24:40.510
Do you go to Sunday school?

1488
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:42.773
Or. uh. have you ever
thought about it?

1489
01:24:43.948 --> 01:24:47.256
- Uh...
- Nope. Never. Not once.

1490
01:24:47.256 --> 01:24:49.780
We asked Margaret
the question. Sylvia.

1491
01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:50.868
Margaret?

1492
01:24:50.868 --> 01:24:52.391
Well. you're wasting your time

1493
01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:55.307
because Margaret went
to Temple and she's Jewish.

1494
01:24:55.307 --> 01:24:57.048
- What did you say?

1495
01:24:57.048 --> 01:24:58.136
Excuse me.

1496
01:24:58.136 --> 01:24:59.616
Margaret went to Temple.

1497
01:24:59.616 --> 01:25:01.270
- Okay. Mom. you're done.
- What are you talking about?

1498
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:03.054
Okay. that's it.
Well.
you left the room

1499
01:25:03.054 --> 01:25:04.882
and they're
trying to convert her.

1500
01:25:04.882 --> 01:25:06.188
Well. Margaret has the right
to be baptized

1501
01:25:06.188 --> 01:25:07.363
if she wants to be.

1502
01:25:07.363 --> 01:25:09.321
- Baptized?
If she wants to be.

1503
01:25:09.321 --> 01:25:10.322
I can't believe this.

1504
01:25:11.845 --> 01:25:13.238
I can't believe
you're doing this.

1505
01:25:13.238 --> 01:25:15.066
All right. Everyone.
this discussion is over.

1506
01:25:15.066 --> 01:25:17.068
We're her parents
and this discussion is over.

1507
01:25:17.068 --> 01:25:19.157
Yeah. you're right. it's over.
because she's already Jewish.

1508
01:25:19.157 --> 01:25:20.854
- Sylvia!
- Well. in our eyes.

1509
01:25:20.854 --> 01:25:24.380
- she's Christian.
- No. no! Margaret is nothing!

1510
01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:27.470
Margaret is
not Jewish or Christian.

1511
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:30.386
She is no religion
until she decides.

1512
01:25:30.386 --> 01:25:31.561
Well. how can she be Jewish

1513
01:25:31.561 --> 01:25:33.258
- if her mother is Christian?
- Stop.

1514
01:25:33.258 --> 01:25:34.825
You were never there for her.
You abandoned her.

1515
01:25:34.825 --> 01:25:35.956
What does it matter?

1516
01:25:35.956 --> 01:25:37.436
Do you think
that we wanted this?

1517
01:25:40.483 --> 01:25:41.571
Stop it!

1518
01:25:42.963 --> 01:25:44.661
All of you. just stop it.

1519
01:25:44.661 --> 01:25:47.490
I don't care.
I don't care anymore.

1520
01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:49.796
It's all just
so stupid. religion!

1521
01:25:49.796 --> 01:25:51.146
Just stop fighting!

1522
01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:53.452
I... I don't want a religion.

1523
01:25:53.452 --> 01:25:55.715
- I don't care. I don't care!
Margaret...

1524
01:25:56.934 --> 01:25:58.892
I don't even believe in God!

1525
01:26:07.205 --> 01:26:08.989
- Are you happy? Hmm?

1526
01:26:11.122 --> 01:26:13.168
- I'm so sorry. I did this.
- No. no. no. This is not...

1527
01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:14.647
- I am so sorry.
- No. this is not your fault.

1528
01:26:14.647 --> 01:26:17.520
This is not your fault.
Okay. this is not your fault.

1529
01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:20.262
No. that was everybody else.
That was not...

1530
01:26:20.262 --> 01:26:22.133
- Me.
- No. no. no.

1531
01:26:25.049 --> 01:26:26.616
<i>"Dear Mr. Benedict.</i>

1532

Hey.
- Hey.

1548
01:29:14.653 --> 01:29:16.351
Wait. Come here.

1549
01:29:18.048 --> 01:29:19.963
I don't really
feel like talking.

1550
01:29:21.312 --> 01:29:22.748
Yeah. I don't either.

1551
01:29:24.707 --> 01:29:29.712
But. um. I do want to say
sorry for how things went.

1552
01:29:32.323 --> 01:29:36.283
And I know that this past year
has not been easy.

1553
01:29:41.593 --> 01:29:43.290
Want to just sit for a minute?

1554
01:29:58.001 --> 01:30:01.265
Mmm. yeah. Good idea.

1555
01:30:13.930 --> 01:30:17.368
It gets tiring trying so hard
all the time. doesn't it?

1556
01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:20.458
Yeah.

1557
01:30:55.972 --> 01:30:59.541
- One. two. three. Cheese!
Cheese!

1558
01:30:59.541 --> 01:31:03.240

1559
01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.851
Come on. everybody.
Margaret. come on!

1560
01:31:10.726 --> 01:31:11.683
Hey.

1561
01:31:14.294 --> 01:31:15.426
Thanks. Mr. Benedict.

1562
01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:18.690
You're a really good teacher.

1563
01:31:18.690 --> 01:31:20.736
Well. I wouldn't say all that.
You know.

1564
01:31:20.736 --> 01:31:23.173
still trying to iron out
some of the kinks.

1565
01:31:23.173 --> 01:31:24.870
No. you were really good.

1566
01:31:26.785 --> 01:31:28.004
I'm glad you felt that way.

1567
01:31:45.761 --> 01:31:46.718
Hey.

1568
01:31:49.852 --> 01:31:51.157
Do you want to come dance?

1569
01:31:53.508 --> 01:31:54.639
Really?

1570
01:31:55.597 --> 01:31:56.554
Yeah.

1571
01:32:09.872 --> 01:32:11.308
Yes! I knew it!

1572
01:32:11.308 --> 01:32:12.744
You basically already won.

1573
01:32:12.744 --> 01:32:14.659
You've been going
for ages.

1574
01:32:14.659 --> 01:32:17.009
- Ages. Gretchen?
Can I please go?

1575
01:32:17.009 --> 01:32:19.011
Gretchen. quit
complaining all the time.

1576
01:32:19.969 --> 01:32:21.144
I'm not complaining.

1577
01:32:26.366 --> 01:32:27.542
Nancy.

1578
01:32:28.717 --> 01:32:29.892
Come on. please?

1579
01:32:35.941 --> 01:32:36.942
I got it!

1580
01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:54.917
Really nice work
on the shading. Daniel.

1581
01:32:54.917 --> 01:32:56.135
Thank you.

1582
01:32:56.135 --> 01:32:58.181
I think maybe you could
put a wash here

1583
01:32:58.181 --> 01:33:01.880
just to blend that. but I...
It's beautiful.

1584
01:33:07.712 --> 01:33:10.410
- Oh. Hey. Barbara!
- Jan!

1585
01:33:10.410 --> 01:33:12.674
It's so funny to see you.
I was just gonna call you.

1586
01:33:12.674 --> 01:33:14.414
- Oh.
- Can you believe it.

1587
01:33:14.414 --> 01:33:15.807
about the stars?

1588
01:33:15.807 --> 01:33:17.635
- Oh. I know.
- Jeez.

1589
01:33:17.635 --> 01:33:20.203
Well. I guess everything
is a fire hazard these days.

1590
01:33:21.683 --> 01:33:23.206
Anyway. um.

1591
01:33:23.206 --> 01:33:24.381
we're getting
committees together

1592
01:33:24.381 --> 01:33:25.730
over at the Junior High

1593
01:33:25.730 --> 01:33:27.253
and I can think of
at least three

1594
01:33:27.253 --> 01:33:28.994
that you'd be perfect for.

1595
01:33:28.994 --> 01:33:34.826
Oh. Jan. that sounds great
and I'd love to. but. um...

1596
01:33:36.915 --> 01:33:38.221
I don't want to.

1597
01:33:40.658 --> 01:33:42.791
But thank you for asking me.

1598
01:33:42.791 --> 01:33:45.271
- Yeah.
- And. uh...

1599
01:33:46.403 --> 01:33:48.057
- Have a good day!
- Okay.

1600
01:33:52.931 --> 01:33:54.498
<i>I'm going to write you
so many letters.</i>

1601
01:33:54.498 --> 01:33:56.979
So many letters.
the mailman's going to say.

1602
01:33:56.979 --> 01:33:59.024
"That's it! No more!"

1603
01:33:59.024 --> 01:34:00.809
Okay.

1604
01:34:00.809 --> 01:34:02.985
<i>Oh. Have the best time. honey.</i>

1605
01:34:02.985 --> 01:34:04.203
<i>We'll see you
when you get back.</i>

1606
01:34:04.203 --> 01:34:05.291
See you soon. sweetie.

1607
01:34:05.291 --> 01:34:06.684
- Have fun.
- Bye.

1608
01:34:06.684 --> 01:34:07.990
Love you. Bye!

1609
01:34:10.862 --> 01:34:13.212
- Okay. I think this is it.
- Got it?

1610
01:34:13.212 --> 01:34:14.953
- Then we just have to...
Wait. wait. wait.

1611
01:34:14.953 --> 01:34:16.259
- ...close it.
- Yeah.

1612
01:34:16.259 --> 01:34:18.087
- Camera. camera. camera.
Oh. wait.

1613
01:34:18.087 --> 01:34:19.566
- Yes.
All right.

1614
01:34:19.566 --> 01:34:21.699
Okay. Now. we just
have to close it.

1615
01:34:21.699 --> 01:34:23.179
Sides. Check the sides.
- Okay. got it?

1616
01:34:23.179 --> 01:34:24.571
Yeah. yeah. Step on it.
- Ready. Go.

1617
01:34:24.571 --> 01:34:26.965
- Oh. my God! Are you okay?

1618
01:34:26.965 --> 01:34:28.271
Whoo. Ah.

1619
01:34:28.271 --> 01:34:30.273
- Just kidding.
- Every time.

1620
01:34:30.273 --> 01:34:31.578
If it's there. I'll take it.

1621
01:34:31.578 --> 01:34:33.102
- Okay.
Good stuff.
There it is.

1622
01:34:33.102 --> 01:34:34.973
Almost like
we've done it before.

1623
01:34:34.973 --> 01:34:37.323
- Yeah.

1624
01:34:40.239 --> 01:34:41.458
Is it lawn day?

1625
01:34:43.329 --> 01:34:44.330
It is.

1626
01:34:46.985 --> 01:34:48.813
- We haven't paid him yet.
We haven't.

1627
01:34:48.813 --> 01:34:50.641
No. And if you wanted to go
into the kitchen

1628
01:34:50.641 --> 01:34:51.729
and grab it...

1629
01:34:53.252 --> 01:34:56.168
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

1630
01:35:05.438 --> 01:35:06.788
Hey. Hey. Moose.

Oh. thank you. Yeah.

Uh. well. have a good summer.

1634
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:16.319
I won't be seeing you
for a while.

1635
01:35:16.319 --> 01:35:18.060
Oh. where you going?

1636
01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:20.540

Maybe we can hang out
when you get back?

1642
01:35:32.422 --> 01:35:34.032
Re... Really?

1643
01:35:35.077 --> 01:35:36.078
Yeah.

1644

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Oh. my God.

1647
01:36:22.733 --> 01:36:24.387
Mom... Mom?

1648
01:36:25.562 --> 01:36:27.607
Mom! Mom!

1649
01:36:27.607 --> 01:36:29.653
What is it? What's wrong?

1650
01:36:29.653 --> 01:36:32.917
I got it.
I got my period.

1651
01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:34.876
What?

1652
01:36:38.227 --> 01:36:40.055
- I got it. right?
- Yeah!

1653
01:36:41.099 --> 01:36:43.580
- Yeah. Yes.

1654
01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:46.844
Oh. my God.

1655
01:36:51.501 --> 01:36:53.720
- I don't know why I'm crying.

1656
01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.984
Oh. my goodness. Wow.

1657
01:36:55.984 --> 01:36:58.203
- Are you okay? Yeah?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

1658
01:36:58.203 --> 01:37:00.423
- You feel...
- Yep. I'm fine.

1659
01:37:00.423 --> 01:37:02.251
Do you have any cramping or...

1660
01:37:02.251 --> 01:37:04.209
- No. No. no. no. No. I'm fine.
- No?

1661
01:37:04.209 --> 01:37:05.732
I can't believe
this is happening to you.

1662
01:37:05.732 --> 01:37:06.908
I don't believe it either.

1663
01:37:06.908 --> 01:37:08.431
You're a woman!

1664
01:37:08.431 --> 01:37:09.693
I'm a woman!

1665
01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:15.612
Okay. um...
Get down to business.

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:17.919
- Yeah. yeah.
- Yeah.

1668
01:37:17.919 --> 01:37:19.224
I actually bought you some.

1669
01:37:19.224 --> 01:37:20.573
- Really?
- I was going to sneak them

1670
01:37:20.573 --> 01:37:22.619
into your trunk at camp.
you know. just in case.

1671
01:37:22.619 --> 01:37:24.403
But. okay. One sec.

1672
01:37:25.622 --> 01:37:26.753
Be right there.

Okay. So...

1674

Um. this is how they work.

1675
01:37:33.151 --> 01:37:34.892
- So you just put...
- I know how to do it.

1676
01:37:34.892 --> 01:37:36.763
I've been practicing
in my room for two months.

1677
01:37:36.763 --> 01:37:40.332
-  What?

1678

Well. then. you're. um...
You don't need me.

01:37:52.649 --> 01:37:54.520
I'll be right out here. Okay.

1683
01:38:31.514 --> 01:38:33.124
<i>Are you
still there. God?</i>
