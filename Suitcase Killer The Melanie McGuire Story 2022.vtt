Driving down to Atlantic City
to see some friends.

-You're dating someone.
-Jessica?

No. it's. it's not really

my outer nursing grad

to me.

Didn't treat me like some

He's got an ex-wife.
but she's not in the picture.

the girlfriend?

She's in California
for a few weeks.

Not yet with you.

Ah. where's my medium-rare
surf 'n' turf?

78
00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:55.958
-What is that supposed to mean?
-It's supposed to mean...

79
00:04:55.992 --> 00:04:57.696
That I've known you since
fifth grade. and we both

80
00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.066
know you don't know
how to pick 'em.

81
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.841
Look. just go slow. okay?

82
00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:05.945

Don't be nervous.

there's a way.

00:07:22.953 --> 00:07:24.957
Someday.

121
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.029
Till then I just get down here
as much as I can.

122
00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:32.471
Too bad it's a seven-hour drive.

123
00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:34.943

[music continues]

129
00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:27.549
So. I decided.

130
00:08:27.582 --> 00:08:29.585
I'm movin' out
of my parents' place.

131
00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:32.726
-Really? Finally! This is huge.
-I know. right?

132
00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:36.198
And I may have found
a roommate already.

133
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:37.535
[Selene] Yeah?

134
00:08:37.568 --> 00:08:40.073
-Bill McGuire.
-Ugh. seriously?

135
00:08:40.106 --> 00:08:42.077
-I know it's fast--
-Oh. yeah. no kidding.

136
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.682
But we spent the whole drive
back from Virginia talking

137
00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:47.688
about it and we're both
really ready to explore this.

138
00:08:47.722 --> 00:08:49.024
Okay. but living together?

139
00:08:49.058 --> 00:08:50.662
I mean. how well
do you even know him?

140
00:08:50.695 --> 00:08:52.497
-I'm a big girl.
-Oh.

141
00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.538
And. yeah. maybe he's got
some rough edges.

142
00:08:55.571 --> 00:08:57.675
but nothing that I can't fix.

143
00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:00.681
Okay. and when has that
ever worked out?

144
00:09:00.715 --> 00:09:02.384
You know.
I should probably warn him.

145
00:09:02.418 --> 00:09:03.854
Remember what happened
with Tony Parisi

146
00:09:03.888 --> 00:09:05.858
and that girl
from Staten Island? Ah-ah-ah!

147
00:09:05.891 --> 00:09:07.795
You shoved him
outside the door butt-naked

148
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:09.197
and you locked the door
behind him.

149
00:09:09.231 --> 00:09:11.737
-He deserved it.
-You sent him to the hospital.

150
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.976
The temperature
sent him to the hospital.

151
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.113
How was I supposed to know
it was five below zero?

152
00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:18.817
Oh. honey. you knew.

153
00:09:20.555 --> 00:09:21.823
You're not gonna tell
these stories when

154
00:09:21.857 --> 00:09:23.660
you're my maid of honor.
are you?

155
00:09:23.693 --> 00:09:25.965
Shut up. You're joking. right?

156
00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:27.635
Are you engaged
and you didn't tell me?

157
00:09:27.668 --> 00:09:29.906
-Are you serious. Mel?
-Well... No. I'm joking!

158
00:09:29.939 --> 00:09:32.712
Well. why would you do that
to me. Mel? Come on!

159
00:09:32.745 --> 00:09:34.849
But I'm telling you right now...

160
00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:37.588
it's gonna be him.

161
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:39.625
You really like him. don't you?

162
00:09:41.563 --> 00:09:43.165
I do.

163
00:09:45.337 --> 00:09:47.107

165
00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:58.496
How much was that?

166
00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:00.166
Twenty-five hundred.

167
00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:04.474
-Which I'm about to win back.
-Can't you win it back tomorrow?

Twenty more minutes. baby.

Hey. go on up to the room.
I'll be there soon.

I came here is

of. and I couldn't live

-Where are you from. Daniela?
-Oh. I'm from Brazil.

384
00:22:37.681 --> 00:22:40.019

-Oh. right on.
-Yeah.

388
00:22:48.903 --> 00:22:52.276
All right. Daniela. so have you
ever donated eggs before?

389
00:22:52.309 --> 00:22:55.583
No. but a friend of mine did and
she said it was a perfect way

390
00:22:55.616 --> 00:22:57.386
to make some extra cash.
you know?

391
00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.658
-Hey. I-I-I wanted to ask you.
-Mm-hmm.

392
00:22:59.691 --> 00:23:01.529
This guy I'm seeing is worried

393
00:23:01.562 --> 00:23:05.202
that the hormones will interfere
with our sex life.

394
00:23:05.235 --> 00:23:07.039
Is that true?

395
00:23:07.072 --> 00:23:08.610
It can happen for some donors.

396
00:23:08.643 --> 00:23:10.279
but most of the time
the biggest complaint

397
00:23:10.312 --> 00:23:11.882
is just the mood swings.

398
00:23:11.916 --> 00:23:15.255
Well. nothing he can't fix
with some fine jewelry. right?

399
00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:17.694
I like the way you think.
Daniela.

00:32:36.645 --> 00:32:39.918
His gambling is a wrecking ball.

519
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:42.991
for our future
and the boys' future.

520
00:32:43.024 --> 00:32:46.532
[sighs] And to top it all off.

521
00:32:46.565 --> 00:32:51.107
an offer we made on a house
was accepted. which is crazy.

522
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.946
But at least it's money

523
00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.152
that he can't gamble away.

524
00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:02.229
Well. maybe this could be
a fresh start.

525
00:33:02.262 --> 00:33:06.170
You guys can start over.

526
00:33:07.907 --> 00:33:10.078
He'll never change.

527
00:33:17.092 --> 00:33:19.296
I want a do-over.

What are you doing up?

532
00:33:38.201 --> 00:33:41.608
Oh. I'm... I couldn't sleep.

533
00:33:41.642 --> 00:33:45.215
So I'm just. uh. gettin'
some work done.

534
00:33:45.249 --> 00:33:48.454
3:00 in the morning?
Come back to bed.

535
00:33:49.189 --> 00:33:51.327
I'll be there in a minute.

536

Hi. Mm-hmm.

542
00:35:16.965 --> 00:35:19.571
101. Yeah. no. Yes.

543
00:35:19.604 --> 00:35:21.908
You can go ahead and give him
some Tylenol. Thanks.

544
00:35:21.942 --> 00:35:26.852
N-not the... No. Not the grape.
He likes the cherry.

545
00:35:26.885 --> 00:35:30.859
Yeah. the cherry one. please.
Look. I gotta go.

550
00:35:55.509 --> 00:35:58.649
Bill. they are not paying you
enough for these hours.

551
00:35:58.682 --> 00:36:01.421
Or did the parking trolls
get you again?

552
00:36:01.454 --> 00:36:03.893
Someone moved my car.

553
00:36:03.926 --> 00:36:06.030
Left it back at the office.

554
00:36:06.064 --> 00:36:08.969
I don't understand.
Who would do that?

555
00:36:10.973 --> 00:36:12.810
[keys jingling]

556
00:36:12.844 --> 00:36:14.747
Someone with a spare key.

557
00:36:16.317 --> 00:36:18.154
You made me miss
a drinks meeting with Marty.

558
00:36:18.187 --> 00:36:20.726
my boss.
the guy who decides tenure!

559
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.764
I don't know what you're talking
about. but you know.

560
00:36:22.797 --> 00:36:24.133
the boys are sleeping.

561
00:36:24.166 --> 00:36:27.439
So if you could just
keep your voice down...

562
00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:30.646
Did you move it?

563
00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.852
You know it really took me
a long time to get JC--

564
00:36:33.886 --> 00:36:35.756
Did you move my car?

565
00:36:37.092 --> 00:36:38.995
What. move your car?

566
00:36:41.033 --> 00:36:43.238
-Of course not.
-There.

567
00:36:43.271 --> 00:36:44.774
There it is.

568
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.749

-Did you move my car?
-What did I just say?

572
00:36:55.495 --> 00:36:57.934
Except. you were smiling
when you said it. bitch.

573
00:36:57.967 --> 00:37:00.439
We both know what that means!

574
00:37:00.472 --> 00:37:04.446
Did you move my goddamn car?

575
00:37:07.553 --> 00:37:09.991
And why would I do
something like that?

576
00:37:12.496 --> 00:37:15.936
Can you think of any reason? Hm?

Congratulations. Mr. McGuire.

588
00:39:42.128 --> 00:39:45.468
You are officially a co-owner

of a four-bedroom.
three-bath residence

590

Hope we're not in
over our heads.

595
00:40:18.702 --> 00:40:21.407
Well. there's no going back now.

596
00:40:21.441 --> 00:40:23.912

We found a head
and upper torso. chief.

602

Yeah. they-they have to belong
to the legs

603

that washed up last week.

604
00:40:57.479 --> 00:41:00.553
Same brand of suitcase.
Kenneth Cole.

605
00:41:00.586 --> 00:41:02.690
Probably one of those
luggage sets.

Yeah. he working on it.

607
00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:08.702

I'm Detective Stanyan with the
Woodbridge Police Department.

614

Is your step-daughter
Melanie here?

615
00:41:45.542 --> 00:41:48.682
Yeah. she is. Can I tell her
what this is about?

616
00:41:48.715 --> 00:41:50.852
We should talk inside. sir.

617
00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:54.828
-All right. Come on.
-I went to her house.

618

she was here.

619

Uh. please. This is my wife
Linda. my daughter Melanie.

-Hi.

-Do you mind if I sit?
-Yeah.

622
00:42:17.706 --> 00:42:21.147
I think it would be better
if the children weren't here.

623
00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.050
Okay. well. now you're getting
me worried. detective.

Mom. can you take them?

There's no easy way
to say this. ma'am.

Your husband. Bill McGuire.
was found dead in Virginia.

631

Oh. my God.

632
00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.000
I know he'd been
reported missing.

633
00:42:48.033 --> 00:42:51.574
His friends. Jon and Susan Rice.
identified the body for us.

634
00:42:51.608 --> 00:42:54.379
From the water?
W-w-what? What. did he drown?

635
00:42:54.413 --> 00:42:56.083
-How did he die?
-Wish I could elaborate.

636
00:42:56.116 --> 00:42:57.787
But we're not leading
this investigation.

637
00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:00.024
This is Virginia Beach's case.

638
00:43:00.058 --> 00:43:01.828
They'll be reaching out to you
shortly.

639
00:43:01.861 --> 00:43:03.464
-Honey.
-Oh. oh...

640
00:43:03.498 --> 00:43:07.238
[sobbing] Wait.
this isn't happening.

641
00:43:07.272 --> 00:43:09.476
-I'm so sorry. ma'am.
-My God!

642
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:11.815
Are the boys in the other room?

643
00:43:11.848 --> 00:43:15.087
I know. I'm so sorry.

644
00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.160
[intense music]

645
00:43:22.235 --> 00:43:25.342
[sighs] You need to take
compassionate leave.

646
00:43:25.375 --> 00:43:26.410
-A month or two.
-No.

647
00:43:26.443 --> 00:43:27.547
I'll have HR clear it.

648
00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:30.652
I-I want to work.

649
00:43:30.685 --> 00:43:34.193
It'll keep me sane. You're here.

650
00:43:34.226 --> 00:43:38.668
[sighs] God.
I-I can't believe he's dead.

651
00:43:38.702 --> 00:43:40.639
All this time I thought
he was just off

652
00:43:40.673 --> 00:43:43.377
binging with his girlfriend
in Atlantic City.

653
00:43:43.411 --> 00:43:47.018
We were supposed to move in
to our new house next week.

654
00:43:47.987 --> 00:43:49.122
Uh. I...

655
00:43:50.626 --> 00:43:52.797
I don't even wanna go there.

656
00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:55.067
-You just bought it.
-With Bill.

657
00:43:56.203 --> 00:43:57.640
I'm just gonna stay
with my parents

658
00:43:57.673 --> 00:44:00.411
until I figure out
what I'm gonna do.

659
00:44:00.444 --> 00:44:02.248
Oh. my God!

660
00:44:05.689 --> 00:44:08.661
I can only imagine
what you're going through.

661
00:44:09.864 --> 00:44:11.333
I mean. even if things
weren't good at the end.

662
00:44:11.366 --> 00:44:13.605
you guys have history together.
you have memories.

663
00:44:13.639 --> 00:44:15.809
You need to grieve.

664
00:44:15.842 --> 00:44:19.784
So if you wanna take a break
from us.

665
00:44:19.817 --> 00:44:21.486
I mean. I completely understand.

666
00:44:21.521 --> 00:44:22.890
No.

667
00:44:24.259 --> 00:44:26.931
No. You-you don't get it.

668
00:44:31.139 --> 00:44:32.543
I was divorcing him.

669
00:44:32.576 --> 00:44:35.782
[dramatic music]

670
00:44:43.565 --> 00:44:47.807
A lawyer isn't needed. by the
way. This is not adversarial.

671
00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.211
Oh. Judy's just
my divorce attorney.

672
00:44:50.244 --> 00:44:53.351
I only asked her to be here
as an extra set of ears.

673
00:44:53.384 --> 00:44:54.820
All right. Ms. McGuire.

674
00:44:54.854 --> 00:44:58.695
if I could start
with the last time you saw Bill.

675
00:44:58.729 --> 00:45:03.304
Yeah. um. April 28th.
in the early morning.

676
00:45:03.337 --> 00:45:08.481
around 4:00 or 5:00
is when he walked out on us.

677
00:45:08.515 --> 00:45:10.619
-On you and your children?
-Yes.

678
00:45:10.653 --> 00:45:14.125
And this was at the house
at 2902 Plaza Drive?

679
00:45:15.628 --> 00:45:17.866
Right. yes.
We'd just had a fight.

680
00:45:17.899 --> 00:45:20.037
The fight noted in
the temporary restraining order

681
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:21.941
that you filed two days later?

682
00:45:21.974 --> 00:45:25.281
He got physical.
it wasn't the first time.

683
00:45:25.314 --> 00:45:28.789
but I was worried about what
might happen when he came back.

684
00:45:28.822 --> 00:45:32.796
-Physical meaning violent?
-Yes.

685
00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:35.835
You did the right thing. ma'am.
Too many women wait.

686
00:45:35.869 --> 00:45:37.774
So had he not died.
Bill would be coming back

687
00:45:37.807 --> 00:45:40.512
to divorce papers?
That was your intention?

688
00:45:40.546 --> 00:45:44.854
I retained duty right after
the restraining order.

689
00:45:44.887 --> 00:45:47.927
Okay. so just so I'm clear.

690
00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.664
the fight that led you
to end the marriage

691
00:45:49.697 --> 00:45:51.901
took place the day after
you and your husband

692
00:45:51.935 --> 00:45:53.638
closed on
the Warren County property.

693
00:45:53.671 --> 00:45:56.611
Yeah. Ridiculous timing. I know.

694
00:45:56.644 --> 00:45:59.082
[whistles]
Huh. that's a beautiful house.

695
00:45:59.116 --> 00:46:02.756
I mean. it's like a dream home.
really.

696
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:05.161
-Not Bill's.
-You talked him into it?

697
00:46:05.194 --> 00:46:08.100
Oh. that's what
the fight was about.

698
00:46:08.133 --> 00:46:10.371
Bill had a gambling problem.

699
00:46:10.404 --> 00:46:12.208
I loved this house.
but mostly I thought

700
00:46:12.241 --> 00:46:14.112
real estate was a good way
to lock up our money.

701
00:46:14.145 --> 00:46:17.452
-So that Bill couldn't touch it.
-Okay. Right.

702
00:46:17.485 --> 00:46:21.460
[Pickell] The next step for us.
we need to search your home.

703
00:46:21.493 --> 00:46:23.330
Great.

704
00:46:23.364 --> 00:46:26.369
[instrumental music]

705
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:32.181
You own a Kenneth Cole
luggage set. Ms. McGuire?

706
00:46:32.214 --> 00:46:34.319
Uh. I do. I did.

707
00:46:34.353 --> 00:46:37.091
Uh. I don't know. I think Bill
took it with him when he left.

708
00:46:37.125 --> 00:46:38.628
I don't know
if it's Kenneth Cole.

709
00:46:38.662 --> 00:46:40.832
but it's maybe something
name brand.

710
00:46:40.866 --> 00:46:43.772
Ms. McGuire. this. this laptop.
yours or Bill's?

711
00:46:43.805 --> 00:46:45.274
It's both of ours. we shared it.

712
00:46:45.307 --> 00:46:48.146
-May we take it for a few days?
-Yeah. of course.

713
00:46:57.666 --> 00:47:01.473
[sighs] I mean. I don't know
what else they want from me.

714
00:47:01.507 --> 00:47:03.210
I have answered their questions.

715
00:47:03.243 --> 00:47:05.380
I've bent over backwards
trying to help them.

716
00:47:05.414 --> 00:47:08.086
And now they're just buzzing
around the house like bees.

717
00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.959
Okay. don't take it personal.
they're just doing their job.

718
00:47:10.993 --> 00:47:13.130
[Michael] Selene's right.
they're checking their boxes.

719
00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:14.633
They have to look at the spouse.

720
00:47:14.667 --> 00:47:17.038
That is an awful feeling.

721
00:47:17.072 --> 00:47:19.108
It'll pass.
Just tell them everything.

722
00:47:19.142 --> 00:47:21.748
-What's everything?
-[Michael] Anything relevant.

723
00:47:21.781 --> 00:47:25.154
-Full cooperation.
-Oh...

724
00:47:25.187 --> 00:47:29.128
Well. what if it's not relevant.
but they might think it is?

725
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.201
Mn-mn. This doesn't sound good.

726
00:47:34.239 --> 00:47:36.677
Remember how Bill had a felony
for perjury?

727
00:47:36.711 --> 00:47:38.882
Yeah. the whole
speeding-ticket thing?

728
00:47:38.915 --> 00:47:41.153
He wouldn't have passed
a background check.

729
00:47:41.186 --> 00:47:42.689
so he asked me
to get it for him.

730
00:47:42.723 --> 00:47:44.960
Just pestered me about it
for months.

731
00:47:44.994 --> 00:47:47.098
so finally I just gave in.

732
00:47:47.131 --> 00:47:49.202
Get what. sweetheart?

733
00:47:50.839 --> 00:47:53.176
A gun.

734
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:56.016
Uh. he wouldn't leave it alone.
you know. especially once

735
00:47:56.049 --> 00:47:57.587
he knew we were moving.
he thought we needed

736
00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:59.122
protection out there.

737
00:47:59.155 --> 00:48:00.825
-What kind of gun?
-Well. I don't. I don't know.

738
00:48:00.859 --> 00:48:02.763
I don't know a gun
from a can of paint. pop.

739
00:48:02.796 --> 00:48:05.167
Whatever he told me to get.
A-a pistol.

740
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.807
-Okay. where is it now?
-The hell if I know.

741
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.943
I gave it to him.
I never saw it again.

742
00:48:09.977 --> 00:48:11.982
Okay. okay. that's fine.
That's fine.

743
00:48:12.015 --> 00:48:14.452
We tell them now.
Get out in front of it.

744
00:48:14.485 --> 00:48:19.028
But the bigger problem
is gonna be when I bought it.

745
00:48:19.864 --> 00:48:22.434
[intense music]

746
00:48:25.876 --> 00:48:28.347
[Patti] Okay.
show me what you got.

747
00:48:28.381 --> 00:48:31.286
[Stanyan] This is April 26th.
at a retailer in Pennsylvania.

748
00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:35.862
A nickel-finish Taurus .38.
one box of wadcutter rounds.

749
00:48:35.895 --> 00:48:38.200
April 26th?
Where is this on our timeline?

750
00:48:38.234 --> 00:48:41.172
Two days before she claims
she last saw the victim.

751
00:48:41.541 --> 00:48:43.043
Ah...

752
00:48:50.558 --> 00:48:52.228
Download me. Where are we?

753
00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:54.967
There's zero evidence
she had plans to leave him.

754
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.904
All her legal moves.
the abuse claim.

755
00:48:56.938 --> 00:48:58.641
the TRO.
hiring a divorce lawyer.

756
00:48:58.675 --> 00:49:01.346
occurred immediately
<i>after</i> Bill vanished.

757
00:49:01.379 --> 00:49:04.386
Mm. an attempt to back-fill
her narrative.

758
00:49:04.419 --> 00:49:06.389
-Exactly.
-You've got the gun purchase.

759
00:49:06.423 --> 00:49:07.960
Y-you don't have the gun.
though.

760
00:49:07.994 --> 00:49:09.462
She claims
that Bill took it with him.

761
00:49:09.496 --> 00:49:11.901
You've one bullet retrieved from
the torso's ribcage.

762
00:49:11.934 --> 00:49:14.005
a wadcutter.
just like the one she purchased.

763
00:49:14.038 --> 00:49:15.274
Unfortunately. it's the most

764
00:49:15.307 --> 00:49:16.710
popular target round
in the country.

765
00:49:16.744 --> 00:49:18.748
And the black garbage bags
found in the suitcases.

766
00:49:18.781 --> 00:49:21.487
they exactly match the bags
from the McGuire kitchen.

767
00:49:21.521 --> 00:49:23.758
Same grade of plastic.
the same factory.

768
00:49:23.791 --> 00:49:26.830
But also the same commonality
problem as the bullets.

769
00:49:26.864 --> 00:49:28.066
They're sold
all over the East Coast.

770
00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.636
I'm not worried about it.

771
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.073
Now. where are we on DNA?

772
00:49:31.106 --> 00:49:33.177
Nothing at the townhouse.
some very heavy

773
00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:35.414
bleach residue. though.
Somebody cleaned well.

774
00:49:35.448 --> 00:49:37.953
-[Pickell] Not in Bill's car.
-You found it?

775
00:49:37.987 --> 00:49:40.324
Thursday. An impound yard
in Atlantic City.

776
00:49:40.357 --> 00:49:42.996
His DNA all over the floor mats.

777
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:44.900
-Blood?
-Skin fragments.

778
00:49:44.933 --> 00:49:47.640
Most likely tracked in
on someone's shoes.

779
00:49:47.673 --> 00:49:48.808
Good.

780
00:49:48.841 --> 00:49:50.144
I think you should know that.

781
00:49:50.177 --> 00:49:52.883
in person.
I find her convincing.

782
00:49:52.916 --> 00:49:54.887
Steady as she goes
in our interviews.

783
00:49:54.921 --> 00:49:56.791
Well. I find Meryl Streep
convincing.

784
00:49:56.825 --> 00:49:59.061
Sh-she's still an actress.

785
00:50:04.707 --> 00:50:06.711
Gentleman.
our person of interest

786
00:50:06.744 --> 00:50:08.781
just got a lot more interesting.

787
00:50:08.814 --> 00:50:11.787
[intense music]

788
00:50:16.697 --> 00:50:18.534
[indistinct chatter]

789
00:50:18.568 --> 00:50:21.372
[instrumental music]

790
00:50:22.876 --> 00:50:26.149
[sobbing]

791
00:50:38.575 --> 00:50:41.279
I know we're grieving.
but I've lost my brother.

792
00:50:41.313 --> 00:50:44.151
so I'm just gonna come out
and say it.

793
00:50:44.185 --> 00:50:48.059
He deserved better.
That service was totally rushed.

794
00:50:48.093 --> 00:50:49.664
[Cindy] The priest didn't even
know his name.

795
00:50:49.697 --> 00:50:52.602
That was the only time slot
that they had left.

796
00:50:52.636 --> 00:50:54.706
Where were the boys?

797
00:50:59.115 --> 00:51:01.621
They've been through enough.

798
00:51:01.654 --> 00:51:04.527
Bill is their father.

799
00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:07.599
Mom. give us a minute?
Hey. the boys are two and four.

800
00:51:07.633 --> 00:51:09.570
They cry for their daddy every
single night. and I hold them

801
00:51:09.604 --> 00:51:11.908
until it stops.
I was just trying to spare them.

802
00:51:11.941 --> 00:51:14.312
-Bill would've wanted them here.
-I couldn't really ask him.

803
00:51:14.346 --> 00:51:17.519
Now. could I? And since when are
you so concerned about the boys?

804
00:51:17.553 --> 00:51:19.790
You're the aunt
they barely know.

805
00:51:21.627 --> 00:51:23.129
I'm sorry.

806
00:51:24.298 --> 00:51:26.670
God. I'm sorry.
That was not okay.

807
00:51:26.704 --> 00:51:30.912
I'm a single mother
in the middle of a nightmare.

808
00:51:30.946 --> 00:51:33.518
and I'm just trying
to get through it.

809
00:51:33.551 --> 00:51:35.254
It's not over
until they found his killer.

810
00:51:35.288 --> 00:51:37.424
You haven't forgotten
about that. have you?

811
00:51:37.458 --> 00:51:41.466
Because you seem
remarkably uninterested.

812
00:51:41.499 --> 00:51:46.510
The boys and I
need to keep living. Cindy.

813
00:51:48.514 --> 00:51:50.652
I take it back.

814
00:51:50.685 --> 00:51:53.658
Not all of us are grieving.
are we?

815
00:51:53.691 --> 00:51:55.862
[intense music]

816
00:51:55.896 --> 00:51:59.135
Well. I'm sorry the service
wasn't to your liking.

817
00:52:00.037 --> 00:52:03.309
[music continues]

818
00:52:11.961 --> 00:52:13.898
-[knocking on door]
-[camera clicks]

819
00:52:22.983 --> 00:52:25.087
[Melanie] It's been quiet.

820
00:52:25.121 --> 00:52:27.692
No police contact
for two months.

821
00:52:28.995 --> 00:52:30.798
Maybe they've moved on.

822
00:52:31.934 --> 00:52:34.372
-You think?
-They should.

823
00:52:34.406 --> 00:52:37.244
[sighs]
They need to.

824
00:52:37.278 --> 00:52:39.983
because I don't how much more
of this I can take.

825
00:52:40.017 --> 00:52:41.920
The waiting is hell.

826
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:46.095
Some days I just wish
they'd just

827
00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:48.868
get it over with
and arrest me already.

828
00:52:48.902 --> 00:52:50.939
Hey.

829
00:52:50.972 --> 00:52:55.147
It won't come to that.
I promise.

830
00:52:55.181 --> 00:52:57.919
You're innocent.
that's where they'll end up.

831
00:53:06.036 --> 00:53:08.908
Good morning. Thank you.

832
00:53:13.784 --> 00:53:17.492
Dr. Miller. Detective Stanyan.
Woodbridge Police Department.

833
00:53:17.526 --> 00:53:19.763
-You have a minute?
-What's this about?

834
00:53:19.797 --> 00:53:23.337
I just have a few questions
about Melanie McGuire.

835
00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:26.711
Melanie? That's Dr. Scott's
nurse. mostly.

836
00:53:26.744 --> 00:53:29.916
He may be better qualified
to assist you.

837
00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:31.820
I don't think so. doctor.

838
00:53:33.958 --> 00:53:36.930
[intense music]

839
00:53:38.902 --> 00:53:41.272
That is a beautiful family.

840
00:53:41.305 --> 00:53:43.009
We need to talk.

841
00:53:47.719 --> 00:53:50.758
[music continues]

842
00:53:58.608 --> 00:54:02.248
Where are we with motive?
Anything more. Terry?

843
00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:05.420
Uh. we don't need more.
We've got a lover.

844
00:54:05.454 --> 00:54:08.260
The oldest story
in the murder-your-spouse book.

845
00:54:08.293 --> 00:54:10.031
Except there's no evidence
Dr. Miller

846
00:54:10.064 --> 00:54:12.401
planned to divorce his wife.

847
00:54:12.435 --> 00:54:14.172
Maybe she hoped he would.

848
00:54:14.205 --> 00:54:16.643
Or maybe it's something bigger.

849
00:54:16.677 --> 00:54:18.581
-Bigger?
-Deeper.

850
00:54:18.614 --> 00:54:20.551
When Melanie was four.
her dad ditched the fam

851
00:54:20.585 --> 00:54:22.487
for a brand-new life
in California.

852
00:54:22.522 --> 00:54:24.425
then promptly died
of liver cancer.

853
00:54:24.458 --> 00:54:26.463
What?
That made her a sociopath?

854
00:54:26.496 --> 00:54:28.166
Uh. maybe not sociopath.

855
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.437
but everyone has triggers.

856
00:54:31.641 --> 00:54:35.915
[Bill] Did you move
my goddamn car?

857
00:54:35.948 --> 00:54:37.452
[Anne] <i>Add domestic violence
to the mix.</i>

858
00:54:37.485 --> 00:54:38.955
Okay. wait. wait. wait. No.

859
00:54:38.988 --> 00:54:41.192
We are not maligning the victim.

860
00:54:41.225 --> 00:54:43.463
You know. she says he got rough
with her. but we don't know

861
00:54:43.496 --> 00:54:45.602
that. there's no report of that.

862
00:54:45.635 --> 00:54:47.171
I thought
we're discussing motive.

863
00:54:47.205 --> 00:54:50.177
We are.
A motive that gets a win for us.

864
00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:52.715
[Patti] Now. a victim who had it
coming isn't gonna do that.

865
00:54:52.749 --> 00:54:56.256
Neither is a-a sad.
weepy childhood story. No.

866
00:54:56.289 --> 00:55:00.130
But what will
is a secret lover.

867
00:55:00.164 --> 00:55:01.867
Obsession.

868
00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:06.510
Now. now. the fantasy of
starting a new life with someone

869
00:55:06.544 --> 00:55:09.583
without any of the trappings
of her old one...

870
00:55:09.617 --> 00:55:11.888
I mean.
people can relate to that.

871
00:55:11.921 --> 00:55:13.691
And who of us hasn't dreamt

872
00:55:13.724 --> 00:55:16.496
of doing that
at least at one point?

873
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.501
-Of killing our spouses?
-No. of being free.

874
00:55:19.536 --> 00:55:23.476
Free. totally free.
of-of a mess that we've made.

875
00:55:24.412 --> 00:55:28.120
Okay. Terry. Tell me our story.

876
00:55:28.153 --> 00:55:31.092
-From?
-The night of.

877
00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:36.102
Early morning. actually.
4:30 a.m..

878
00:55:36.136 --> 00:55:37.739
the suspect claims that--

879
00:55:37.773 --> 00:55:39.375
Defendant.

880
00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:41.580
Uh. we haven't charged her yet.

881
00:55:41.613 --> 00:55:43.918
Well. let's just try it on
for size.

882
00:55:43.951 --> 00:55:46.657
[chuckling]

883
00:55:46.690 --> 00:55:47.759
Right.

884
00:55:47.793 --> 00:55:50.230
The morning
the defendant claims.

885
00:55:50.264 --> 00:55:52.836
in court filings
and police interviews.

886
00:55:52.869 --> 00:55:55.708
she had a fight with the victim
and feared for her life.

887
00:55:55.742 --> 00:55:58.480
Well. ladies and gentleman
of the jury.

888
00:55:58.514 --> 00:56:01.787
I regret to inform you.
there was no fight.

889
00:56:01.821 --> 00:56:04.491
The night he and Melanie
closed on their dream home

890
00:56:04.526 --> 00:56:09.068
and celebrated with wine.
she killed him in cold blood.

891
00:56:09.101 --> 00:56:11.339
And Bill never saw it coming.

892
00:56:11.372 --> 00:56:14.913
How could he know
that two weeks earlier.

893
00:56:14.947 --> 00:56:16.950
<i>the defendant
was on her home computer</i>

894
00:56:16.983 --> 00:56:21.627
<i>conducting Internet searches
on how to sedate someone?</i>

895
00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:24.265
[Terry] <i>That just two days
before that night</i>

896
00:56:24.298 --> 00:56:27.204
<i>she drove to a Pennsylvania gun
store where she would purchase</i>

897
00:56:27.238 --> 00:56:30.945
<i>a .38 caliber Taurus revolver
she would use to kill him?</i>

898
00:56:30.979 --> 00:56:35.555
How could he know
that just one day before.

899
00:56:35.588 --> 00:56:37.992
<i>she forged her lover's
signature and handed over</i>

900
00:56:38.026 --> 00:56:40.665
<i>a fraudulent prescription
of 500 milliliters</i>

901
00:56:40.698 --> 00:56:44.873
<i>of chloral hydrate syrup
to a pharmacist?</i>

902
00:56:51.319 --> 00:56:53.389
<i>How could he know</i>

903
00:56:53.423 --> 00:56:55.895
<i>that when he closed his eyes
that night.</i>

904
00:56:55.928 --> 00:56:59.769
<i>drugged from the altered wine
she had given him...</i>

905
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:04.546
<i>that he'd sleep
just long enough for her</i>

906
00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:07.217
<i>to drop the kids off
at preschool...</i>

907
00:57:10.057 --> 00:57:12.862
<i>and return to end his life?</i>

908
00:57:12.895 --> 00:57:15.935
[intense music]

909
00:57:23.016 --> 00:57:25.087
How could he know

910
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:26.389
that he would never...

911
00:57:26.423 --> 00:57:27.893
[gunshot]

912
00:57:27.926 --> 00:57:30.230
wake up?

913
00:57:30.264 --> 00:57:31.600
[gunshot]

914
00:57:35.006 --> 00:57:36.844
Can I say something?

915
00:57:36.877 --> 00:57:40.618
-Yes. Anne?
-So far the townhouse is clean.

916
00:57:40.652 --> 00:57:42.655
They did a luminol search
and they didn't find anything.

917
00:57:42.689 --> 00:57:45.995
No blood in the bathroom.
no blood on the. on the couch.

918
00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:48.166
I'm having a team
from the outside

919
00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.435
come and do a deeper dig.

920
00:57:49.468 --> 00:57:51.105
Yeah. but what if

921
00:57:51.139 --> 00:57:52.709
the crime scene
proves to be somewhere else?

922
00:57:52.742 --> 00:57:55.314
It won't.
And we don't want it to.

923
00:57:55.347 --> 00:57:57.986
No. no. the townhouse
is a better story.

924
00:57:58.019 --> 00:57:59.355
Okay. keep going. Terry.

925
00:57:59.388 --> 00:58:03.096
Uh. from the shooting.
He's dead on the couch.

926
00:58:03.129 --> 00:58:05.568
So now Melanie
has a body to dispose of.

927
00:58:05.602 --> 00:58:07.038
[Terry] <i>It's early
in the morning. the kids are</i>

928
00:58:07.071 --> 00:58:09.041
<i>in school. her folks have
agreed to pick</i>

929
00:58:09.074 --> 00:58:11.814
<i>them up from school
and keep them that night.</i>

930
00:58:11.847 --> 00:58:13.951
<i>So now Melanie has two days</i>

931
00:58:13.984 --> 00:58:17.726
<i>to get Bill into the suitcases
and clean up her mess.</i>

932
00:58:17.759 --> 00:58:20.898
[garbage bags rustling]

933
00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:23.971
[intense music]

934
00:58:33.089 --> 00:58:36.095
[machine whirring]

935
00:58:43.143 --> 00:58:47.786
She did a good job on the house.
Perfect. in fact.

936
00:58:47.819 --> 00:58:51.192
But she forgot about her shoes.

937
00:58:51.225 --> 00:58:53.897
<i>When she dumped Bill's car
in Atlantic City</i>

938
00:58:53.931 --> 00:58:56.335
<i>to throw investigators
off her scent.</i>

939
00:58:56.368 --> 00:59:00.277
<i>she tracked tiny skin fragments
from her butchering</i>

940
00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:02.214
all over the floor mats.

941
00:59:02.247 --> 00:59:05.988
I-I don't like "skin fragments."
It's too-too clinical.

942
00:59:07.091 --> 00:59:09.563
I know. let's say

943
00:59:09.596 --> 00:59:11.900
human sawdust.

944
00:59:12.769 --> 00:59:15.440
I like that. I like that.

945
00:59:15.473 --> 00:59:17.812
Human sawdust.

946
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:21.620
I think we're ready.

947
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:25.628
[school bell ringing]

948
00:59:26.697 --> 00:59:29.669
Now. remember.
use your listening ears

949
00:59:29.703 --> 00:59:31.472
for Ms. Gail today. okay?

950
00:59:31.506 --> 00:59:34.412
-Okay.
-All right. I love you. baby.

951
00:59:34.445 --> 00:59:37.619
And. uh. Ahma and PopPop are
gonna pick you up after school.

952
00:59:37.652 --> 00:59:40.423
-Okay? Have a good day.
-You. too.

953
00:59:40.457 --> 00:59:42.360
-Bye.
-Bye.

[indistinct radio chatter]

956
01:00:01.767 --> 01:00:03.470
Melanie McGuire.
put your hands on your head.

957
01:00:03.503 --> 01:00:04.606
interlace your fingers.

958
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.644
-Do you have any weapons on you?
-No.

959
01:00:06.677 --> 01:00:08.146
You have the right
to remain silent.

960
01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:09.849
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

961
01:00:09.882 --> 01:00:12.487
in a court of law. You have
the right to an attorney.

962
01:00:12.522 --> 01:00:15.628
You cannot afford one. the court
will provide one for you.

963
01:00:15.661 --> 01:00:17.464
Do you understand these rights
you've just heard?

964
01:00:17.497 --> 01:00:20.069
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

965
01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.832
[judge] Mrs. McGuire.
how are you pleading?

966
01:00:36.737 --> 01:00:38.306
Not guilty. You Honor.

967
01:00:38.339 --> 01:00:40.545
Let the record show
that the defendant has pled

968
01:00:40.578 --> 01:00:42.549
not guilty
to the arresting charge of

969
01:00:42.582 --> 01:00:44.720
first-degree murder
of William McGuire.

970
01:00:44.753 --> 01:00:48.360
Counsel's request for
a preliminary hearing is denied.

971
01:00:48.393 --> 01:00:51.399
Bail is set at $750.000.

[intense music]

973
01:01:01.553 --> 01:01:05.695
Yes. this is Michael Cappararo.
I do all my banking with you.

974
01:01:05.729 --> 01:01:07.765
Can I speak to a loan officer.
please?

975

I wanna take out
a second mortgage on my house.

976
01:01:10.638 --> 01:01:14.178
No. no. no. I'll hold. I need
to speak with him right away.

<i>Now. forget the prurient

<i>We haven't decided if we will
seek the death penalty.</i>

of this crime</i>

985

-It's just money.

We gotta get to the custody

01:03:34.693 --> 01:03:39.068
-Yes. but. Your Honor. I-I--
-I'm speaking. Ms. McGuire.

1031
01:03:39.101 --> 01:03:41.940
Now. given
the extraordinary gravity

1032
01:03:41.974 --> 01:03:44.111
of the criminal action
against you

1033
01:03:44.144 --> 01:03:47.151
and given the allegations
of child neglect

1034
01:03:47.184 --> 01:03:49.188
by family members
through their counsel.

1035
01:03:49.221 --> 01:03:53.730
the court has no other choice
but to revoke custody.

1036
01:03:53.764 --> 01:03:56.068
So at this time
the court hereby assigns

1037
01:03:56.101 --> 01:04:00.611
emergency sole guardianship
to Jack and Jason's aunt.

1038
01:04:00.644 --> 01:04:02.180
Ms. Cindy Ligosh.

1039
01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:04.852
[intense music]

1040
01:04:05.721 --> 01:04:07.090
Next case.

1041
01:04:09.629 --> 01:04:12.902
[indistinct chatter]

1042
01:04:16.108 --> 01:04:17.545
[Melanie] Bill's sisters
are lying

1043
01:04:17.578 --> 01:04:18.747
to Family Services about me.

1044
01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:20.818
I can petition
for supervised visits.

1045
01:04:20.851 --> 01:04:22.988
but a social worker
has to be there.

1046
01:04:24.392 --> 01:04:25.527
Brad.

1047
01:04:27.732 --> 01:04:29.201
I'm here.

1048
01:04:30.738 --> 01:04:34.377
[Brad] <i>Have you been watching
TV? They know about us.</i>

1049
01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:40.791
It's all over the news.
Charla's not talking to me.

1050
01:04:40.824 --> 01:04:42.528
No surprise there.

1051
01:04:43.698 --> 01:04:46.235
The RMA fired me today.

1052
01:04:46.268 --> 01:04:49.509
Oh. Brad. uh. I'm so sorry.

1053
01:04:50.511 --> 01:04:52.381
The detectives called me.

1054
01:04:52.414 --> 01:04:55.554
-They wanna meet with me again.
-About what?

1055
01:04:55.588 --> 01:04:57.123
<i>They think I'm your accomplice.</i>

1056
01:04:57.157 --> 01:04:59.261
For something
that didn't happen?

1057
01:04:59.294 --> 01:05:01.198
I know. uh...

1058
01:05:01.232 --> 01:05:03.570
Yeah. they're just trying
to scare me.

1059
01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.979
They said on the day
you bought the gun.

1060
01:05:08.012 --> 01:05:11.118
we were on the phone
for a hundred minutes.

1061
01:05:11.151 --> 01:05:13.023
You know what that looks like?

1062
01:05:13.056 --> 01:05:15.059
Well. we did nothing wrong.

1063
01:05:17.164 --> 01:05:19.334
So you'd tell me. right?

1064
01:05:20.838 --> 01:05:22.107
I mean.
if you had anything to do with

1065
01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.277
what happened to Bill.
you'd tell me?

1066
01:05:25.446 --> 01:05:27.652
I already have.

1067
01:05:27.685 --> 01:05:29.054
Just say it again.

1068
01:05:29.087 --> 01:05:31.660
On my children's lives.
a thousand times over.

1069
01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:34.131
absolutely nothing.

1070
01:05:34.165 --> 01:05:38.472
I know. I know. Thank you.

1071
01:05:40.511 --> 01:05:42.849
What's going on?

1072
01:05:42.882 --> 01:05:45.387
Nothing. No. nothing.

1073
01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.625
[Brad] Sweetie. I just wanted
to hear it again.

1074
01:05:47.658 --> 01:05:50.597
I gotta go. okay? I'll-I'll
check in with you later.

1075
01:05:51.867 --> 01:05:55.106
-[Melanie] <i>I love you.</i>
-I love you. too.

1076
01:05:59.883 --> 01:06:01.251
[clears throat]

1077
01:06:04.257 --> 01:06:08.098
[Stanyan] Ah. I know what
you're thinking. Why me?

1078
01:06:08.132 --> 01:06:11.907
The easy answer is you're
the lover of a murder suspect.

1079
01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:13.409
who we believe had help.

1080
01:06:13.443 --> 01:06:16.382
But another way
to think of it is

1081
01:06:16.415 --> 01:06:18.352
you're in a position
to help her.

1082
01:06:18.385 --> 01:06:22.393
Could be we're way off.
What you get from her proves it.

1083
01:06:23.797 --> 01:06:25.266
You're way off.

1084
01:06:26.202 --> 01:06:28.473
I hope so. Dr. Miller.

1085
01:06:28.507 --> 01:06:30.009
I really do.

1086
01:06:36.656 --> 01:06:38.560
[instrumental music]

1087
01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:40.664
Number two.

1088
01:06:42.535 --> 01:06:44.137
Ten dollars.

1089
01:06:49.014 --> 01:06:50.584
Thank you.

1090
01:06:55.561 --> 01:06:58.165
[cell phone ringing]

1091
01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:05.246
Hello? Hi. yeah.

1092
01:07:06.148 --> 01:07:08.352
Yes. Thank you.

1093
01:07:15.099 --> 01:07:18.239
[dramatic music]

1094
01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:25.687
Come in. Come in.

1095
01:07:27.257 --> 01:07:29.763
Joe Tacopina.
Can I call you Melanie?

1096
01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:32.066
-Please do.
-Please have a seat.

1097
01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:33.770
Thank you.

1098
01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:38.547
Can we get you anything?
Water? Coffee?

1099
01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:39.916
No. thank you.

1100
01:07:39.949 --> 01:07:42.020
I must say. you've got
quite the advocate

1101
01:07:42.054 --> 01:07:43.890
in Selene Trevizas.

1102
01:07:43.924 --> 01:07:45.293
She was relentless.

1103
01:07:45.326 --> 01:07:48.132
Yeah. that's Selene.
uh. even when I told her

1104
01:07:48.165 --> 01:07:49.769
I couldn't possibly afford you.

1105
01:07:49.803 --> 01:07:53.276
Ah. let's not worry about that
now. We'll figure it out.

1106
01:07:53.309 --> 01:07:56.048
This is Stephen Turano.
he's licensed in New Jersey.

1107
01:07:56.082 --> 01:07:57.785
so he'll be my co-counsel.

1108
01:07:57.819 --> 01:08:00.357
-Good to meet you.
-Hi.

1109
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:04.165
What they're doing to you.
Melanie. is appalling.

1110
01:08:04.198 --> 01:08:06.201
Prosecutors are bullies.

1111
01:08:06.235 --> 01:08:10.878
but Prezioso
is her own sadistic breed.

1112
01:08:10.911 --> 01:08:13.817
Well. it's time she met me.

1113
01:08:13.851 --> 01:08:16.155
I tear bullies to shreds.

1114
01:08:16.188 --> 01:08:19.127
So let's get to work. shall we?

1115
01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:22.100
-Yeah.
-Good.

1116
01:08:22.133 --> 01:08:24.839
Take me to the last time
you saw Bill McGuire.

1117
01:08:24.872 --> 01:08:28.345
Um. well. we had just closed

1118
01:08:28.379 --> 01:08:32.855
on the Warren County house.
I was ecstatic.

1119
01:08:32.888 --> 01:08:35.694
[Melanie] <i>Bill. not so much. but
I was determined to celebrate.</i>

1120
01:08:35.728 --> 01:08:39.802
<i>so I opened up
a nice bottle of wine.</i>

1121
01:08:39.836 --> 01:08:42.140
<i>We finished it.</i>

1122
01:08:42.173 --> 01:08:43.577
<i>But it didn't relax Bill
at all.</i>

1123
01:08:43.611 --> 01:08:45.881
[Bill] Goddamn it!
She's unbelievable!

1124
01:08:45.914 --> 01:08:47.751
[clattering]

1125
01:08:50.156 --> 01:08:52.427
Bill. Bill.

1126
01:08:54.064 --> 01:08:55.499
Hey. calm...

1127
01:08:56.803 --> 01:08:58.138
[grunts]

1128
01:08:58.172 --> 01:08:59.809
It's 4:00 in the morning.

1129
01:08:59.843 --> 01:09:02.715
How many times have I said
I don't wanna see

1130
01:09:02.748 --> 01:09:04.886
dryer sheets in this house?

1131
01:09:04.919 --> 01:09:08.693
They're for lazy people! You
ever hear of fabric softener?

1132
01:09:09.596 --> 01:09:10.463
Oh. God.

1133
01:09:10.497 --> 01:09:12.668
Your problem is
you don't listen!

1134
01:09:12.702 --> 01:09:15.273
How many times did I say
I don't want this house?

1135
01:09:15.306 --> 01:09:17.978
Five-hundred-thousand dollars
is gonna wreck us!

1136
01:09:18.012 --> 01:09:19.949
-What are you doing?
-I'm cleaning up.

1137
01:09:19.983 --> 01:09:22.487
Leave it!

1138
01:09:22.521 --> 01:09:24.491
Goddammit! I said leave it!

1139
01:09:24.525 --> 01:09:27.297
-[indistinct yelling]
-Don't touch me! Don't...

1140
01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:29.200
Oh. you wanna clean it?
You wanna. you wanna clean it?

1141
01:09:29.234 --> 01:09:31.773
I got just the place for it.
How about this?

1142
01:09:31.806 --> 01:09:34.178
-No.
-Open your mouth. Mm?

1143
01:09:34.211 --> 01:09:37.150
Yeah. just swallow. Exactly.

1144
01:09:37.183 --> 01:09:39.889
Good. right? Yeah. swallow.

1145
01:09:39.923 --> 01:09:41.926
-No!
-Swallow.

1146
01:09:41.959 --> 01:09:43.963
-[groans]
-Swallow it all the way.

1147
01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:46.603
[groans]

1148
01:09:46.636 --> 01:09:48.874
[coughs]

1149
01:09:48.907 --> 01:09:50.577
[Jason] Mommy?

1150
01:09:54.184 --> 01:09:55.654
Oh. Baby.

1151
01:09:55.688 --> 01:09:58.626
[indistinct chatter]

1152
01:09:58.660 --> 01:09:59.929
Come here.

1153
01:10:00.931 --> 01:10:02.467
No. it's okay.

1154
01:10:06.976 --> 01:10:08.479
Open the door.

1155
01:10:08.514 --> 01:10:11.687
-[bangs]
-Open the goddamn door!

1156
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.057
[Bill] Open the door!

1157
01:10:14.091 --> 01:10:16.194
-[banging on door]
-[shushing]

1158
01:10:16.228 --> 01:10:19.267
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

1159
01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:22.340
[Bill] Fine. I'm done with this.

1160
01:10:22.374 --> 01:10:25.614
-Ah!
-I know. it's okay. It's okay.

1161
01:10:25.647 --> 01:10:28.753
That must've been very scary.

1162
01:10:28.787 --> 01:10:30.524
What happened next?

1163
01:10:32.427 --> 01:10:35.200
[Melanie] <i>We stayed
in the bathroom.</i>

1164
01:10:35.233 --> 01:10:37.003
<i>I could hear him packing.</i>

1165
01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:47.692
[door opens]

1166
01:10:47.725 --> 01:10:49.829
<i>Then I heard
the garage door open.</i>

1167
01:10:49.862 --> 01:10:52.634
Right here. Shh. shh. shh...

1168
01:10:57.177 --> 01:10:58.880
[engine starts]

1169
01:11:00.851 --> 01:11:03.890
[engine revving]

1170
01:11:06.128 --> 01:11:08.332
<i>He sped away.</i>

1171
01:11:08.365 --> 01:11:11.338
<i>And that's the last time
I ever saw him.</i>

1172
01:11:14.344 --> 01:11:17.250
[Tacopina] <i>Who do you think
killed your husband?</i>

1173
01:11:17.283 --> 01:11:20.456
[sighs] I don't know.

1174
01:11:20.489 --> 01:11:23.396
I don't know. I'm sure
Bill had a long list of people

1175
01:11:23.429 --> 01:11:25.032
who he pissed off. I...

1176
01:11:25.066 --> 01:11:27.237
[Melanie] <i>Maybe he owed
some bad guys money.</i>

1177
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:29.942
<i>I don't know who did this
to my husband.</i>

1178
01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:35.486
Let's turn to the days
immediately after he left.

1179
01:11:35.521 --> 01:11:38.159
Prezioso has
your E-ZPass records.

1180
01:11:38.192 --> 01:11:41.064
Uh. you drove to Atlantic City.

1181
01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:44.203
<i>they say. to dump Bill's car.</i>

1182
01:11:44.237 --> 01:11:47.176
It's okay. this is where we tell
her what she doesn't know

1183
01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:50.651
about that trip.
We can do that now. or--

1184
01:11:50.684 --> 01:11:53.623
No. no. I don't need any time.
it's just...

1185
01:11:54.525 --> 01:11:56.663
It's just embarrassing is all.

1186
01:11:56.696 --> 01:12:00.804
Not one of my finest moments.
Just dumb.

1187
01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:04.545
<i>I went to Atlantic City
to look for Bill's car.</i>

1188
01:12:04.579 --> 01:12:08.018
<i>Once I found it.
I moved it with my spare key.</i>

1189
01:12:11.025 --> 01:12:13.797
I drove it to another casino
few miles down the road.

1190
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:17.905
You know. "Good luck
finding your car. you jerk."

1191
01:12:17.939 --> 01:12:20.877
But at the time. I. um...

1192
01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:24.384
<i>I'd been taking Xanax.</i>

1193
01:12:24.417 --> 01:12:26.354
<i>I had taken a few that night.</i>

1194
01:12:26.388 --> 01:12:29.428
<i>I was in no condition
to be driving home.</i>

1195
01:12:29.461 --> 01:12:31.398
So I took a cab home.

1196
01:12:32.701 --> 01:12:35.674
And then you took. uh.
another cab right back?

1197
01:12:35.708 --> 01:12:37.879
Yeah. well. by the time
I got back to Woodbridge.

1198
01:12:37.912 --> 01:12:39.381
I was feelin' better.

1199
01:12:39.414 --> 01:12:43.055
And I needed my car.
so I went back for it.

1200
01:12:43.089 --> 01:12:46.696
Just so we're clear. that's
another two hours in a cab.

1201
01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:48.232
for a total of four hours.

1202
01:12:48.265 --> 01:12:51.506
the combined fares
close to. what. $500?

1203
01:12:51.539 --> 01:12:54.444
-Yeah.
-For a prank?

1204
01:12:54.477 --> 01:12:56.682
For my hide-a-car revenge. yes.

1205
01:12:58.219 --> 01:13:01.158
I mean. I'd done it before.

1206
01:13:01.191 --> 01:13:05.066
I could tell you a better story.
but it wouldn't be true.

1207
01:13:05.099 --> 01:13:06.603
You also called E-ZPass billing

1208
01:13:06.636 --> 01:13:08.640
to try to get the charges erased
on this trip.

1209
01:13:08.674 --> 01:13:11.679
Right. After they started
investigating me.

1210
01:13:11.712 --> 01:13:13.984
Pfft. I was worried
how it'd make me look.

1211
01:13:14.017 --> 01:13:16.454
Oh. No kidding.

1212
01:13:17.592 --> 01:13:20.664
Stephen. let's remember.

1213
01:13:20.698 --> 01:13:23.704
they have the burden of proof.
not us.

1214
01:13:23.737 --> 01:13:27.144
Their story has to be perfect.
not hers.

1215
01:13:27.177 --> 01:13:29.348
Know what our client is?

1216
01:13:29.381 --> 01:13:30.951
Consistent.

1217
01:13:30.984 --> 01:13:34.091
A year's worth of police
transcripts and recordings.

1218
01:13:34.124 --> 01:13:36.362
and she never wavers.

1219
01:13:36.395 --> 01:13:40.103
-That tells a jury she's honest.
-[scoffs]

1220
01:13:40.136 --> 01:13:44.143
Hell. uh. even her boyfriend
couldn't shake her.

1221
01:13:44.712 --> 01:13:45.947
Janice.

1222
01:13:51.124 --> 01:13:53.897
[Melanie on recording]
<i>Well. we did nothing wrong.</i>

1223
01:13:53.931 --> 01:13:55.934
[Brad on recording] <i>So you'd
tell me. right? I mean...</i>

1224
01:13:55.968 --> 01:13:57.671
<i>If you had anything to do
with what happened to Bill...</i>

1225
01:13:57.705 --> 01:14:00.543
<i>-You'd tell me.</i>
-[Melanie] <i>I already have.</i>

1226
01:14:01.646 --> 01:14:03.249
[Brad] <i>Say it again.</i>

1227
01:14:03.282 --> 01:14:05.687
[Melanie] <i>On my children's
lives. a thousand times over.</i>

1228
01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.025
<i>absolutely nothing.</i>

1229
01:14:11.498 --> 01:14:15.373
Are you okay. Melanie?
Can we get you a-a water?

1230
01:14:15.406 --> 01:14:18.646
[intense music]

1231
01:14:23.088 --> 01:14:25.059
[dramatic music]

1232
01:14:40.624 --> 01:14:43.563
A wiretap. ladies and gentlemen.

1233
01:14:43.597 --> 01:14:48.305
is a weapon of choice
for lazy prosecutors.

1234
01:14:48.339 --> 01:14:52.814
[Tacopina] In my client's case.
detectives used Dr. Miller

1235
01:14:52.848 --> 01:14:55.554
to question her by proxy.

1236
01:14:55.587 --> 01:14:58.993
<i>forcing the man
she trusted most</i>

1237
01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:02.601
to catch her
at her most vulnerable.

1238
01:15:02.634 --> 01:15:05.974
without the benefit of counsel.

1239
01:15:06.008 --> 01:15:11.151
Remember. Ms. Prezioso
maintains. without evidence.

1240
01:15:11.184 --> 01:15:13.188
<i>that Dr. Miller was Melanie's</i>

1241
01:15:13.222 --> 01:15:16.328
<i>entire motive
for killing her husband.</i>

1242
01:15:16.361 --> 01:15:19.200
And yet I ask you.

1243
01:15:19.234 --> 01:15:21.840
where on those many tapes

1244
01:15:21.873 --> 01:15:25.179
<i>recorded during
raw and intimate moments</i>

1245
01:15:25.212 --> 01:15:29.087
<i>does my client admit
or even imply.</i>

1246
01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.458
she had anything to do

1247
01:15:31.492 --> 01:15:34.230
with Bill McGuire's death?

1248
01:15:35.801 --> 01:15:37.738
Nowhere.

1249
01:15:37.771 --> 01:15:39.675
Even as Dr. Miller

1250
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:43.749
pressed her over and over
for the confession

1251
01:15:43.783 --> 01:15:47.624
Ms. Prezioso
so desperately wanted...

1252
01:15:47.658 --> 01:15:51.566
While Dr. Miller was making
those recordings.

1253
01:15:51.599 --> 01:15:54.738
he was still seeing my client.

1254
01:15:54.772 --> 01:15:58.647
<i>He was still trusting her.
he was still loving her.</i>

1255
01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.888
<i>despite everything these
detectives were telling him.</i>

1256
01:16:04.057 --> 01:16:08.265
Those recordings
only exonerate my client.

1257
01:16:08.299 --> 01:16:13.308
They show the true.
the unguarded Melanie McGuire.

1258
01:16:13.341 --> 01:16:15.814
Imperfect? Yes.

1259
01:16:15.848 --> 01:16:20.758
Seeking refuge from a cruel
and violent husband...

1260
01:16:20.791 --> 01:16:23.697
-[indistinct yelling]
-Don't touch me! Don't...

1261
01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:26.201
But a depraved killer?

1262
01:16:26.234 --> 01:16:27.704
No way.

1263
01:16:28.372 --> 01:16:29.675
Never.

1264
01:16:30.476 --> 01:16:32.180
So let's be done with all this.

1265
01:16:32.213 --> 01:16:36.723
We can grieve the victim.
and we absolutely should.

1266
01:16:36.756 --> 01:16:39.729
But. members of the jury.
I ask you.

1267
01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:43.970
end this persecution
of an innocent woman.

1268
01:16:45.306 --> 01:16:48.646
Melanie McGuire is not guilty

1269
01:16:48.679 --> 01:16:50.683
of this crime.

1270
01:16:50.717 --> 01:16:53.957
Allow her to get on
with her life.

1271
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:59.167
Allow her to go home
to her children.

1272
01:17:01.504 --> 01:17:03.041
Thank you.

1273
01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.381
I gotta be honest.

1274
01:17:23.415 --> 01:17:28.091
keeping up with the defendant's
fantastical account

1275
01:17:28.125 --> 01:17:32.400
over the past two years
has been a full-time job.

1276
01:17:32.433 --> 01:17:33.869
But. thankfully.

1277
01:17:33.903 --> 01:17:37.109
she can't lie her way
out of DNA.

1278
01:17:37.143 --> 01:17:41.586
Can't spin the human sawdust
she tracked into Bill's car

1279
01:17:41.619 --> 01:17:44.591
after cutting him to pieces.

1280
01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:46.495
You need nothing more
to convict her.

1281
01:17:46.529 --> 01:17:49.969
but there's even more.

1282
01:17:50.002 --> 01:17:51.338
and you have it in abundance.

1283
01:17:51.371 --> 01:17:55.880
starting with the fact
that there was no fight.

1284
01:17:59.521 --> 01:18:03.195
In the early hours
of April 28th. 2004.

1285
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:05.132
there was no fight.

1286
01:18:05.166 --> 01:18:07.737
No. Bill never sped off
in his car.

1287
01:18:07.771 --> 01:18:11.444
No. instead.
he lay in a stupor...

1288
01:18:13.315 --> 01:18:15.118
<i>from the chloral hydrate</i>

1289
01:18:15.152 --> 01:18:18.191
<i>that the autopsy found
in his bloodstream.</i>

1290
01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:21.397
Incapacitated...

1291
01:18:23.102 --> 01:18:27.176
by the date-rape drug
that Melanie used to poison him.

1292
01:18:27.209 --> 01:18:30.182
[intense music]

1293
01:18:31.619 --> 01:18:34.792
What happened next took two days

1294
01:18:34.825 --> 01:18:39.233
and it. it is not
for the faint of heart.

1295
01:18:40.603 --> 01:18:42.874
[gunshots]

1296
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:46.516
[intense music]

1297
01:18:46.549 --> 01:18:48.620
[machine whirring]

1298
01:18:48.653 --> 01:18:51.592
[music continues]

1299
01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:54.798
[machine whirring]

1300
01:18:57.538 --> 01:18:59.274
A seven-hour drive. now just

1301
01:18:59.307 --> 01:19:01.011
think about that.
ladies and gentlemen.

1302
01:19:01.044 --> 01:19:03.315
[Patti] <i>Seven hours in a car</i>

1303
01:19:03.349 --> 01:19:06.623
with her husband
stuffed into suitcases

1304
01:19:06.656 --> 01:19:09.160
in the back of her SUV.

1305
01:19:14.404 --> 01:19:16.776
Did she reflect in horror
on what she had done?

1306
01:19:16.810 --> 01:19:20.049
<i>Uh. show any remorse
whatsoever?</i>

1307
01:19:20.082 --> 01:19:22.888
No. her actions tell us
that she did not.

1308
01:19:22.921 --> 01:19:26.695
because Melanie's last act
that night

1309
01:19:26.729 --> 01:19:30.002
was to throw out
the father of her children...

1310
01:19:31.104 --> 01:19:33.408
like she was throwing out
the trash.

1311
01:19:34.845 --> 01:19:36.982
[water splashes]

1312
01:19:39.855 --> 01:19:43.128
[Devesa] Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury.

1313
01:19:43.161 --> 01:19:46.602
the defense and the prosecution
have rested.

1314
01:19:46.635 --> 01:19:48.305
You've heard my instructions.

1315
01:19:48.339 --> 01:19:51.879
You're hereby dismissed
to begin deliberations.

1316
01:19:51.913 --> 01:19:53.516
Please follow the bailiff.

1317
01:19:53.549 --> 01:19:54.985
[gavel bangs]

1318
01:19:55.987 --> 01:19:57.825
So?

1319
01:19:57.858 --> 01:19:59.896
They're drowning
in reasonable doubt.

1320
01:19:59.929 --> 01:20:02.433
Acquittal. no question.

1321
01:20:02.466 --> 01:20:05.405
[intense music]

1322
01:20:13.488 --> 01:20:14.925
[instrumental music]

1323
01:20:20.202 --> 01:20:22.339
Hi. Melanie.

1324
01:20:22.373 --> 01:20:24.177
Alice Davis.
Thank you for having us.

1325
01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:25.613
Yeah. Of course.

1326
01:20:28.185 --> 01:20:31.592
<i>I just hope the jury does
the right thing for Billy.</i>

1327
01:20:31.625 --> 01:20:35.867
[Cindy] <i>Patti has fought
so hard for him.</i>

1328
01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:39.107
<i>for us. for justice.</i>

1329
01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:40.810
[man] And we're rolling.

1330
01:20:40.844 --> 01:20:44.116
It's day two
of jury deliberations.

1331
01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:47.658
You're out on bail.
a free woman.

1332
01:20:47.691 --> 01:20:52.066
staring at the very real
prospect of life in prison.

1333
01:20:53.736 --> 01:20:55.841
-The waiting must be--
-Agony.

1334
01:20:55.874 --> 01:20:59.014
-Yeah.
-What's going through your mind?

1335
01:20:59.047 --> 01:21:01.084
Patti told a good story.

1336
01:21:01.117 --> 01:21:03.054
Hell. if it were a movie.
I'd watch it.

1337
01:21:03.087 --> 01:21:06.529
<i>Melanie has been lying about
my brother for two years.</i>

1338
01:21:06.562 --> 01:21:08.933
<i>and now this trial
has been seven weeks</i>

1339
01:21:08.967 --> 01:21:11.337
<i>of nothing
but lies. lies. lies.</i>

1340
01:21:11.371 --> 01:21:14.878
<i>And it's time for a verdict of
guilty to finally shut her up.</i>

1341
01:21:15.814 --> 01:21:17.551
Joe Tacopina told a story--

1342
01:21:17.584 --> 01:21:18.953
He told the truth.

1343
01:21:18.986 --> 01:21:21.157
A version that. quite frankly.
many people

1344
01:21:21.190 --> 01:21:23.996
are having trouble believing.

1345
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:26.703
Well. let's hope the 12 people
who matter the most

1346
01:21:26.736 --> 01:21:28.438
are smarter than that.

1347
01:21:28.471 --> 01:21:32.146
<i>I feel most for her parents.
Linda and Michael.</i>

1348
01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:33.448
<i>who I've always adored.</i>

1349
01:21:33.482 --> 01:21:36.287
<i>She's put them
in an impossible position.</i>

1350
01:21:36.321 --> 01:21:38.993
<i>What kind of a person
doesn't search</i>

1351
01:21:39.026 --> 01:21:41.197
<i>for the missing father
of her children?</i>

1352
01:21:41.231 --> 01:21:45.139
Even with all of our problems.
I desperately wanted Bill

1353
01:21:45.172 --> 01:21:49.882
to be found safe and alive.

1354
01:21:49.915 --> 01:21:52.353
<i>For weeks after Billy vanished.
I begged.</i>

1355
01:21:52.386 --> 01:21:56.027
<i>begged her to go with me
to Atlantic City.</i>

1356
01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:58.767
<i>to pressure the police there.
to make phone calls</i>

1357
01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.674
<i>to anyone who knew him
to help us.</i>

1358
01:22:04.343 --> 01:22:05.781
<i>She refused.</i>

1359
01:22:05.814 --> 01:22:08.051
<i>And that told me everything.</i>

1360
01:22:08.085 --> 01:22:11.325
<i>It should tell you everything.
too. Thank you.</i>

1361
01:22:11.358 --> 01:22:14.832
Finally. let me ask you
about Dr. Miller.

1362
01:22:14.865 --> 01:22:17.838
He assisted
in the effort to convict you.

1363
01:22:17.871 --> 01:22:21.579
-Do you hold it against him?
-No. No. they threatened him.

1364
01:22:21.612 --> 01:22:24.416
And he knew
I couldn't incriminate myself.

1365
01:22:24.450 --> 01:22:27.123
If you could do it
all over again.

1366
01:22:27.156 --> 01:22:30.395
would you still have the affair?

1367
01:22:30.428 --> 01:22:31.933
I don't know.

1368
01:22:31.966 --> 01:22:33.969
Do you still love him?

1369
01:22:34.337 --> 01:22:35.606
I did.

1370
01:22:37.209 --> 01:22:39.480
What do you think
happened to Bill?

1371
01:22:39.514 --> 01:22:41.985
Do you really think
he ran afoul of the mob?

1372
01:22:42.019 --> 01:22:44.257
I mean. it certainly fits.

1373
01:22:44.290 --> 01:22:45.560
Got money on the street in AC.

1374
01:22:45.593 --> 01:22:49.233
that's how you get bullets
here and here.

1375
01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:54.109
[Alice] Now. regardless
of the verdict.

1376
01:22:54.143 --> 01:22:57.984
when this program airs.
viewers are going to hear

1377
01:22:58.018 --> 01:23:01.926
claims from you that
are impossible to corroborate.

1378
01:23:01.959 --> 01:23:04.496
Why should our audience
trust you?

1379
01:23:06.969 --> 01:23:09.473
I have no control over that.

1380
01:23:10.677 --> 01:23:13.047
But I know that I'm innocent.

1381
01:23:17.991 --> 01:23:19.293
Thank you.

1382
01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:22.366
Thank you. everyone. We're done.

1383
01:23:24.003 --> 01:23:25.472
Yeah.

1384
01:23:27.176 --> 01:23:29.214
You know. I'm sure
that you get this a lot.

1385
01:23:29.247 --> 01:23:32.252
but you have
an incredible smile.

1386
01:23:33.321 --> 01:23:35.059
Uh. Bill used to say that to me.

1387
01:23:35.092 --> 01:23:39.466
"A thousand watts
of blinding light." he'd say.

1388
01:23:44.912 --> 01:23:48.117
[intense music]

1389
01:24:06.054 --> 01:24:09.326

[intense music]

1391
01:24:19.848 --> 01:24:23.756
Ladies and gentlemen.
the jury has reached a verdict.

1392
01:24:26.729 --> 01:24:30.536
I know there will be strong
feelings of both agreement...

1393
01:24:32.239 --> 01:24:33.843
and disagreement.

1394
01:24:33.876 --> 01:24:37.082
But outbursts
will not be tolerated.

1395
01:24:37.115 --> 01:24:40.422
Clerk Hacker. you may proceed.

1396
01:24:40.455 --> 01:24:43.662
