00:07:14.622 --> 00:07:16.919
Yo. bro. I know you
from somewhere.

174
00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:18.624
Where I know you from. bro?

175
00:07:18.624 --> 00:07:22.089
Oh. yeah. you were on
that Tom Ryder movie I was on.

176
00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:24.289
- You're the stunt guy!
- Not anymore.

177
00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:27.028
Did you. like. break your back
or some shit? -I did. yeah.

178
00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:31.197
I know things haven't been easy
for you since... the incident.

179
00:07:31.197 --> 00:07:32.836
And I just hope

180
00:07:32.836 --> 00:07:35.839
that you don't hold it
against me or Tom.

181
00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:38.303
You know. we were
absolutely devastated.

182
00:07:38.303 --> 00:07:39.711
He sent you a message. right?

183
00:07:42.144 --> 00:07:43.440
The prayer hands emoji?

184
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.014
Right. yeah.
He's still an asshole.

185
00:07:46.014 --> 00:07:47.851
How are you even still alive?
Yo. babe.

186
00:07:47.851 --> 00:07:49.556
- Babe. hey. come here.
- I don't know.

187
00:07:49.556 --> 00:07:50.854
- I wish I wasn't right now.
- You got to meet this guy.

188
00:07:50.854 --> 00:07:52.350
Come here.
You got to hear this.

189
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.220
You don't have to hear this.
It's fine. Hi.

190
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.793
This dude was on a movie
I was on.

191
00:07:55.793 --> 00:07:59.896
- Most epic fail I've ever seen.
-Mm.

192
00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.568
<i>I don't blame
either one of you. Gail.</i>

193
00:08:01.568 --> 00:08:03.064
That was my fault.

194
00:08:03.064 --> 00:08:04.868
And when you start
making mistakes like that.

195
00:08:04.868 --> 00:08:06.298
it's time to hang up the pads.

196
00:08:06.298 --> 00:08:08.003
Oh. it was an accident. Colt.

197
00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:10.137
Everybody knows that.

198
00:08:10.137 --> 00:08:14.504
Tom has put me
in a real situation here. Colt.

199
00:08:14.504 --> 00:08:17.408
I just need a little bit
of help from an old friend.

200
00:08:17.408 --> 00:08:20.015
who just happens to be.
you know. the best stuntman

201
00:08:20.015 --> 00:08:21.819
I've ever worked with
in my life.

202
00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:24.217
Which is why you are getting
on a plane for me tomorrow

203
00:08:24.217 --> 00:08:25.823
and coming to Sydney.

204
00:08:25.823 --> 00:08:27.561
I'm not getting
on a plane. Gail.

205
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:29.563
I can't bear that you would
throw away all that talent.

206
00:08:29.563 --> 00:08:31.994
You shouldn't be
parking cars. Colt.

207
00:08:31.994 --> 00:08:34.667
You need to be smashing
burning Kawasakis

208
00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:35.899
through panes of glass.

209
00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:38.264
Yo. fall guy? Yo.

210
00:08:38.264 --> 00:08:41.399
Bring my car back
without a scratch.

211
00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:43.577
I got a crispy fiver
here for you. bro.

212
00:09:05.964 --> 00:09:08.063
Come on.
It's gonna be like old times.

213
00:09:08.063 --> 00:09:09.735
I know you've missed it.

214
00:09:09.735 --> 00:09:11.066
Goodbye. Gail.

215
00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:13.068
Wait. wait. wait!
Wait. Hold on.

216
00:09:13.068 --> 00:09:15.202
Did I. did I tell you-- I--
Did I tell you

217
00:09:15.202 --> 00:09:16.907
that the director's
asked for you specifically?

218
00:09:16.907 --> 00:09:18.535
Sorry to disappoint him.

219
00:09:18.535 --> 00:09:20.438

Eh. it's new technology.

255
00:11:25.904 --> 00:11:28.071
Basically. we use
the geometry of your face

256
00:11:28.071 --> 00:11:29.666
to retarget Ryder's face.

257
00:11:29.666 --> 00:11:32.174

back on top of your face.

into Tom Cruise. would you?

260
00:11:38.787 --> 00:11:41.282
Hey. welcome to Sydney.
Are you Colt Seavers?

261
00:11:41.282 --> 00:11:43.757
Yeah. Hey. Do you know
where I can get some coffee?

262
00:11:43.757 --> 00:11:45.517
This jet lag
is really kicking in.

263
00:11:45.517 --> 00:11:46.892
Yeah. no stress. I got you.

264
00:11:46.892 --> 00:11:48.762
And does the director know
I'm here?

265
00:11:48.762 --> 00:11:50.060
- She asked for me.
- Uh...

266
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.259
Does-does she want
to say hi or...?

267
00:11:51.259 --> 00:11:53.228
I haven't heard.
No. sorry. bro.

268
00:11:53.228 --> 00:11:54.966
Uh. but the stunt coordinator
wants to see you.

269
00:11:54.966 --> 00:11:57.463
- He's just in the jacket there.
- Okay. great.

270
00:11:57.463 --> 00:11:59.300
Will you just tell her
I'm here and...

271
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.873
you know. that coffee
if you get a chance?

272
00:12:00.873 --> 00:12:02.138
Oh.

273
00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:03.634
- Dan Tucker.

274
00:12:03.634 --> 00:12:06.406
Big-time Hollywood
stunt coordinator.

275
00:12:07.607 --> 00:12:08.947
It's about time.

276
00:12:08.947 --> 00:12:10.608
- Congratulations.

277
00:12:10.608 --> 00:12:12.247
Thank you. Look at you.

278
00:12:12.247 --> 00:12:14.447
So do I call you "sir" now.
or how does that work?

279
00:12:14.447 --> 00:12:16.383
Oh. feel free
to call me "boss." you know.

280
00:12:16.383 --> 00:12:17.923
- Okay. boss.

281
00:12:17.923 --> 00:12:19.749
I don't think I should be
in this Nomex. right?

282
00:12:19.749 --> 00:12:21.619
I mean. it's like. we're not
doing anything crazy. are we?

283
00:12:21.619 --> 00:12:23.060
I was just about
to explain that.

284
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.897
A cannon roll?!

285
00:12:24.897 --> 00:12:26.723
It's time for you to start
rolling cars again

286
00:12:26.723 --> 00:12:28.098
instead of parking them.

287
00:12:28.098 --> 00:12:30.166
You had an accident.

288
00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:33.433
It was a massive
miscalculation of the rig.

289
00:12:33.433 --> 00:12:35.237
I-I almost killed myself
in front of the whole crew.

290
00:12:35.237 --> 00:12:37.404
You know. I'd rather just not
have my first stunt back

291
00:12:37.404 --> 00:12:39.571
be another epic failure.
especially in front of Jody.

292
00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:41.078
I mean. you understand.

293
00:12:41.078 --> 00:12:43.674
"It's not about how hard
of a hit you can give."

294
00:12:43.674 --> 00:12:45.676
- Oh.
-"It's about how many times

295
00:12:45.676 --> 00:12:49.581
you can get hit and keep
moving forward." -Come on.

296
00:12:49.581 --> 00:12:52.826
That's messed up. You can't
quote Rocky on me like that.

297
00:12:52.826 --> 00:12:55.620
So it's a laser gun
with a dagger?

298
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.358
Yes.
like a bayonet. -Right.

299
00:12:57.358 --> 00:12:59.030
Do we need the bayonet?
Wouldn't the laser achieve...

300
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.658
On the battlefield. yes.
Hundred percent.

301
00:13:00.658 --> 00:13:02.528
It just gives it
a quite a strange shape.

302
00:13:02.528 --> 00:13:04.101
- Oh. this guitar bit at the end?
- Yeah.

303
00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:05.762
Yeah. well. you said
you wanted metal.

304
00:13:05.762 --> 00:13:07.269
so it's. like. heavy metal.

305
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:09.106
Okay. how-how... how many
have you done like this?

306
00:13:09.106 --> 00:13:10.437
- Uh. two.
- Okay. Good.

307
00:13:10.437 --> 00:13:12.505
- Hundred.
- Ooh. Okay. Yeah. fantastic.

308
00:13:12.505 --> 00:13:14.705
- Thanks. boss.
- Okay. It looks like a guitar.

309
00:13:14.705 --> 00:13:16.641
Yes. -Nigel. how we doing
on the pyrotechnics?

310
00:13:16.641 --> 00:13:18.280
What's going on? -I think we
only have enough for one take.

311
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.886
- Boss! Boss. listen.
- No. Come on. -Yes.

312
00:13:19.886 --> 00:13:21.613
Yes? -We could create
something that looks

313
00:13:21.613 --> 00:13:23.186
- way more realistic with VFX.
- No. no. no.

314
00:13:23.186 --> 00:13:24.550
- Come on. Give it to me.
- Venti. Venti. Venti.

315
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.123
I don't want real.
I don't want real.

316
00:13:26.123 --> 00:13:28.125
This is a sci-fi epic.
cosmic love story. -Why?

317
00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:29.687
Okay? Of cosmic proportions.

318
00:13:29.687 --> 00:13:31.656
It's got to mirror
that otherworldly thing

319
00:13:31.656 --> 00:13:33.229
when you fall in love.

320
00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:34.692
You know. it's-it's imperfect.
It's beautiful.

321
00:13:34.692 --> 00:13:36.199
I want it that way. okay?

322
00:13:36.199 --> 00:13:38.135
Let's go big with
our one take. okay? -Okay.

323
00:13:38.135 --> 00:13:39.466
- Holy shit.

324
00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:40.665
Was that it?
Was that my one take?

325
00:13:40.665 --> 00:13:41.831
Uh. I'm sure we have--

326
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:43.635
- Oh. my God!

327
00:13:43.635 --> 00:13:45.142
Well. I got to say. though.
looks absolutely fantastic.

328
00:13:45.142 --> 00:13:46.407
-Boss. Listen. listen.
- Look at that.

329
00:13:46.407 --> 00:13:48.079
You sure you want
to use real pyros?

330
00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:49.377
Yeah. -VENTI: But we
definitely don't need this.

331
00:13:49.377 --> 00:13:50.884
- No. no. no. no. Yeah.
- We don't.

332
00:13:50.884 --> 00:13:52.182
Well. we're just gonna
have to loop the actors.

333
00:13:52.182 --> 00:13:53.678
- That's all.
- That's okay. Ray.

334
00:13:53.678 --> 00:13:55.317
It's a stuntman in a car
with a helmet on. okay?

335
00:13:55.317 --> 00:13:56.714
- Oh. Uh. all right.
- No looping. No monologuing.

336
00:13:56.714 --> 00:13:57.649
What the hell is going on
over there. Rush?

337
00:13:57.649 --> 00:13:58.925
We did not call for pyro.

338
00:13:58.925 --> 00:14:00.223
I will seriously
track down your family

339
00:14:00.223 --> 00:14:01.521
and kill every last one of them!

340
00:14:01.521 --> 00:14:03.193
This is why they're doing it.

341
00:14:03.193 --> 00:14:04.997
'Cause they feel you don't
respect them. Nigel. okay?

342
00:14:04.997 --> 00:14:06.592
It's my tone. -Your tone.
your words. all of it. just...

343
00:14:06.592 --> 00:14:08.935
- I see. okay. -Jody? Jody?
- Darla. yes? Okay. Yeah.

344
00:14:08.935 --> 00:14:10.695
Jody. um. sorry. I...
I couldn't get my printer

345
00:14:10.695 --> 00:14:12.169
- working last night...
- Okay. yep.

346
00:14:12.169 --> 00:14:13.665
...but I sort of synthesized
our conversation

347
00:14:13.665 --> 00:14:15.502
that we had on the third act.
and what if

348
00:14:15.502 --> 00:14:18.505
one of the characters in the
film acknowledges in the film

349
00:14:18.505 --> 00:14:20.771
that we're having a problem
with the third act?

350
00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:22.542
- Yeah?
- No. No.

351
00:14:22.542 --> 00:14:23.873
But I appreciate you thinking
outside the box. Darla.

352
00:14:23.873 --> 00:14:25.050
- I really. really do.

353
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.843
Nigel. you've got to stop them.

354
00:14:26.843 --> 00:14:28.185
I will gut you like the pigs
that you are! -Oh. my God.

355
00:14:28.185 --> 00:14:29.681
- Stop testing!
- Whoo!

356
00:14:29.681 --> 00:14:31.056
-Boss!
- Yep?

357
00:14:31.056 --> 00:14:33.091
- Test went well.
- Fantastic.

358
00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:35.885
Okay. so. guys. simmer down.
Eyes on me.

359
00:14:35.885 --> 00:14:37.425
Here's what's gonna happen.

360
00:14:37.425 --> 00:14:39.229
No VFX. Venti.
It looks absolutely fabulous.

361
00:14:39.229 --> 00:14:41.099
Nigel. we need to shoot now.
The tide's coming in.

362
00:14:41.099 --> 00:14:42.463
Let's go.
The shot's gonna be epic.

363
00:14:42.463 --> 00:14:44.795
Shot's up in five. people.
Thank you.

364
00:14:55.984 --> 00:14:57.610
-Colt? Brother?

365
00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.480
What's happening. man?

366
00:15:00.945 --> 00:15:02.780
- Bad sand.
- Bad sand.

367
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.320
Yeah.

368
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.157
I think we got to postpone.
Hate to say it.

369
00:15:06.157 --> 00:15:08.126
NIGEL
Dan. what's the delay. please?

370
00:15:08.126 --> 00:15:10.095
Uh. we're just doing
a little safety check.

371
00:15:10.095 --> 00:15:11.393
It's the density.
It's bad density.

372
00:15:11.393 --> 00:15:13.263
We're looking at
the density of the sand.

373
00:15:13.263 --> 00:15:14.495
There's a new driver.

374
00:15:14.495 --> 00:15:16.068
- Who is it? Where's Henry?
- No idea.

375
00:15:16.068 --> 00:15:18.268
Nigel. this is
the biggest shot of the film.

376
00:15:18.268 --> 00:15:19.764
and I have a newbie.

377
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.602
- Dan says we can do it.
- Okay.

378
00:15:22.602 --> 00:15:25.407
Seriously. we're gonna drift
all over the place.

379
00:15:25.407 --> 00:15:27.079
What is that. a king tide?

380
00:15:27.079 --> 00:15:28.806
Here's what you do.
You wait till it comes in.

381
00:15:28.806 --> 00:15:31.446
It compacts the sand.
then we shoot sunset for sunup.

382
00:15:31.446 --> 00:15:32.612
You're stalling.

383
00:15:32.612 --> 00:15:34.350
- Maybe.
- You're stalling.

384
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.254
Two things can be true.
-Brother. I've got

385
00:15:37.254 --> 00:15:39.751
a tent full of
rookie Australians out here.

386
00:15:39.751 --> 00:15:40.950
I'm gonna be sick.

387
00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:42.622
You got this. You're the one.

388
00:15:42.622 --> 00:15:43.623
- Why you got to say that?
- Okay?

389
00:15:43.623 --> 00:15:44.789
Why you got to say that?

390
00:15:44.789 --> 00:15:46.263
You've done this
a million times.

391
00:15:46.263 --> 00:15:48.298
And so have you.
You know. you just jinxed it.

392
00:15:49.367 --> 00:15:51.037
You just jinxed it!

393
00:15:51.037 --> 00:15:52.500
Hey. Dan. I need the driver
in the car now. please.

394
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.831
- Okay. the tide's coming up.
-Okay.

395
00:15:53.831 --> 00:15:55.008
Thank you so much.
Appreciate you.

396
00:15:55.008 --> 00:15:56.042
- Is that Jody?
- Yes. it's Jody.

397
00:15:57.967 --> 00:15:59.540
She say something about me?

398
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.807
Stop with-- your-your face.
Stop it. Stop it.

399
00:16:02.807 --> 00:16:05.117
She didn't say
anything about you.

400
00:16:05.117 --> 00:16:06.844
Get in the car!

401
00:16:09.651 --> 00:16:11.321
This is really important to her.

402
00:16:11.321 --> 00:16:12.949
Yes. it's important to her.

403
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:15.391
- Is this Comic-Con or something?
- Hall H.

404
00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:18.229
"This is one of those times.

405
00:16:18.229 --> 00:16:21.430
whether it's an inch or a mile.
a win is a win."

406
00:16:23.764 --> 00:16:25.467
That's easy.
<i>Fast and the Furious.</i>

407
00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:26.897
Ah!

408
00:16:26.897 --> 00:16:29.042
- Let's go. You got this.

409
00:16:29.042 --> 00:16:30.373
Did you see the coffee lady?

410
00:16:30.373 --> 00:16:31.572
She was wearing. like. a hat.

411
00:16:31.572 --> 00:16:33.079
- I see you in the car.
- Okay.

412
00:16:34.247 --> 00:16:35.741
Let's get
the medics in place. please.

413
00:16:35.741 --> 00:16:37.809
This is the hero set.
I've got five more after that.

414
00:16:37.809 --> 00:16:39.217
Are you ready. Dan? Yeah.

415
00:16:39.217 --> 00:16:41.384
-Rock and roll.
-Lock it up!

416
00:16:41.384 --> 00:16:43.419
-Thank you.
-Three minute away--

417
00:16:44.455 --> 00:16:45.586
NIGEL
Okay. folks.

418
00:16:45.586 --> 00:16:47.093
he's buckled in.
Stunts are ready.

419
00:16:47.093 --> 00:16:48.655
MAN
Godspeed. Colt.

420
00:16:48.655 --> 00:16:50.426
Everybody knows their spots.

421
00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:52.428
Everybody knows
their responsibilities.

422
00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:53.660
NIGEL
FX. please go hot on the cannon.

423
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.167
Do this right.

424
00:16:55.167 --> 00:16:56.597
MAN
Okay. engaging the cannon now.

425
00:16:56.597 --> 00:16:58.071
We do this safe
and everybody goes home.

426
00:16:58.071 --> 00:16:59.666
MAN 2
Charging the cannon.

427
00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:02.207
MAN
2.000 PSI in the cannon.

428
00:17:02.207 --> 00:17:03.868
Stunts is good.

429
00:17:03.868 --> 00:17:05.903
MAN 2
Cannon is hot.

430
00:17:05.903 --> 00:17:07.509
NIGEL
Cameras. where are we at?

431
00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:09.005
Are you rolling? Camera one?

432
00:17:09.005 --> 00:17:10.413
-Speed on one.
-Camera two?

433
00:17:10.413 --> 00:17:11.876
-Speed.
-Camera three?

434
00:17:11.876 --> 00:17:13.251
-Speed on three.

435
00:17:17.717 --> 00:17:21.358
Background.
And three. two. one.

436
00:17:21.358 --> 00:17:22.953
Action. action. action!

437
00:17:28.598 --> 00:17:30.026
All right. guys. stay frosty.

438
00:17:30.026 --> 00:17:32.072
NIGEL
Three. two. one!

439
00:17:38.971 --> 00:17:41.477
Dan. I need him close to the
camera now. -DAN: Copy that!

440
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:44.315
Look.
I don't want to be that guy.

441
00:17:44.315 --> 00:17:45.778
but the sand's a little loose.

442
00:17:45.778 --> 00:17:47.549
I can't get any traction.

443
00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:49.287
When I do. it jumps.

444
00:17:49.287 --> 00:17:51.916
so if you get any closer.
you're gonna lose the camera.

445
00:17:51.916 --> 00:17:53.621
I know. I know.
but get in there.

446
00:17:53.621 --> 00:17:55.689
- You got this. baby!
- Move up. move up.

447
00:17:57.759 --> 00:17:59.660
No. no. not that close.
Oh. What the--

448
00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.091
NIGEL
Keep rolling.

449
00:18:02.091 --> 00:18:03.631
We have seven more cameras.
Keep rolling!

450
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:05.633
Okay!

451
00:18:05.633 --> 00:18:08.537
Ready in three. two. one!

452
00:18:33.366 --> 00:18:34.761
NIGEL
Nobody goes in

453
00:18:34.761 --> 00:18:36.334
until stunts gives
the all clear.

454
00:18:43.871 --> 00:18:45.310
- Is he all right?
- Colt. you all right?

455
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.279
Quickly. get him.
Come on. get him.

456
00:18:47.279 --> 00:18:48.709
- Just get in there.
-Oh. my God.

457
00:18:48.709 --> 00:18:51.613
- Easy. easy.
-Colt. you did it!

458
00:18:51.613 --> 00:18:53.351
Eight and a half rolls!

459
00:18:53.351 --> 00:18:55.551
Come on. you okay? You good?

460
00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:58.356
You good? Hey. hey.
hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.

461
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.360
Jody's coming. Hold on. Okay.

462
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.790
So good. Dan. Is he good?

463
00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.121
- Yeah. of course.
- So good. so good.

464
00:19:05.121 --> 00:19:06.958
Loved it. loved it.

465
00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.498
- Incredible.
- Okay.

466
00:19:18.543 --> 00:19:19.676
Whose idea was this?

467
00:19:21.172 --> 00:19:23.249
- I think it was Gail's idea.
- I thought it was your idea.

468
00:19:23.249 --> 00:19:25.350
I-I just found out
about this yesterday.

469
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.077
Dan. come on.

470
00:19:27.077 --> 00:19:29.684
I didn't approve him.
I didn't approve him.

471
00:19:29.684 --> 00:19:31.147
I would never have approved him.

472
00:19:31.147 --> 00:19:32.258
- She didn't approve me.

473
00:19:32.258 --> 00:19:33.358
Can I talk to you for a second?

474
00:19:33.358 --> 00:19:34.524
I'm not approved.

475
00:19:34.524 --> 00:19:36.394
Interesting move. Really.

476
00:19:36.394 --> 00:19:39.397
Really interesting.
Just very casual.

477
00:19:39.397 --> 00:19:43.093
Here you are. you show up.
and. "I'm your new stuntman."

478
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.284
Don't do that.
You can't do that. -What?

479
00:19:58.284 --> 00:19:59.978
- Directing a movie.
- Your hat's coming off.

480
00:20:01.718 --> 00:20:03.355
Why are you here?

481
00:20:03.355 --> 00:20:05.588
I think there's been
a misunderstanding. -Clearly.

482
00:20:05.588 --> 00:20:08.426
Because I was under
the impression that...

483
00:20:09.726 --> 00:20:11.429
...you did want me here.

484
00:20:11.429 --> 00:20:13.189
That's a delusional thought.
We haven't spoken in a year.

485
00:20:13.189 --> 00:20:14.531
- Let's not get into it.
- Gail. Gail-- But Gail told me

486
00:20:14.531 --> 00:20:16.368
- that you wanted me here.
- Okay. Whatever.

487
00:20:16.368 --> 00:20:17.864
I don't even care about it.
but you clipped the camera.

488
00:20:17.864 --> 00:20:20.229
I-I-I'm a little rusty.

489
00:20:20.229 --> 00:20:21.967
- Comic-Con shot ruined.
- I'm sor-- I know.

490
00:20:21.967 --> 00:20:24.134
- Hall H. It's a big deal.
- Yeah. Yeah.

491
00:20:24.134 --> 00:20:26.136
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

492
00:20:26.136 --> 00:20:28.138
I'm happy for you.

493
00:20:31.176 --> 00:20:33.583
This whole director thing
looks good on you.

494
00:20:33.583 --> 00:20:36.080
Even the gardening hat. somehow.

495
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.655
Everyone wears them.
It's like a set thing.

496
00:20:39.655 --> 00:20:41.723
- Okay?
- Yeah. I see it. It's--

497
00:20:41.723 --> 00:20:43.890
They're not making it look
as good as you are. that's all.

498
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.596
And I'm not trying to be fla--
I'm just saying the facts.

499
00:20:46.596 --> 00:20:48.400
But you look good in everything.

500
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.831
You look good in nothing.
Whatever.

501
00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:52.569
- No. I don't mean it like that.
- Really? This isn't...

502
00:20:52.569 --> 00:20:53.966
But you do look good
in nothing. -This isn't work--

503
00:20:53.966 --> 00:20:55.341
- This isn't gonna work.
- I mean. you do.

504
00:20:55.341 --> 00:20:57.310
But it's not what I...

505
00:20:59.677 --> 00:21:01.347
- I'll take anyone. Anyone else.
- Yeah.

506
00:21:01.347 --> 00:21:03.107
- Anyone but him.
-Can I be honest with you?

507
00:21:03.107 --> 00:21:05.384
- Who have you got? Yep.
- We literally have no one else.

508
00:21:06.948 --> 00:21:09.355
- What's next?
-The fire burn.

509
00:21:11.183 --> 00:21:12.919
It's your call.

510
00:21:12.919 --> 00:21:14.690
Okay. -NIGEL: Can we get
a nurse on standby. please?

511
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.461
We're gonna set
this man on fire.

512
00:21:34.512 --> 00:21:36.206
JODY
Cut. cut. cut. -That's a cut.

513
00:21:36.206 --> 00:21:38.483
-Cutting there. please.
-That's a cut!

514
00:21:41.719 --> 00:21:43.356
How you feeling. Colt Seavers?

515
00:21:43.356 --> 00:21:44.687
-He's good.
-He's all good.

516
00:21:44.687 --> 00:21:46.854
We're gonna go again.
Thumbs-up. okay?

517
00:21:46.854 --> 00:21:48.317
Technical issue.
Little bump on the dolly.

518
00:21:48.317 --> 00:21:50.726
- Huh?
- Can you fix that. Jimmy?

519
00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:52.321
- Back to ones. please.
- Thank you.

520
00:21:52.321 --> 00:21:54.191
-Going again.
-Please. back to one.

521
00:21:54.191 --> 00:21:56.127
Colt. do you feel a bit
flung into the deep end here?

522
00:21:56.127 --> 00:21:58.294
I'm just wondering. 'cause
you haven't read the script.

523
00:21:58.294 --> 00:21:59.636
if you'd like some backstory.
some context?

524
00:21:59.636 --> 00:22:01.572
- Would that be good?
- Just go with it.

525
00:22:01.572 --> 00:22:03.233
Yeah. helpful?
Okay. Here we go.

526
00:22:03.233 --> 00:22:06.071
So. sci-fi love story.
two characters.

527
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:08.304
one of them's an alien--
Aliena--

528
00:22:08.304 --> 00:22:10.042
and you're Space Cowboy.

529
00:22:10.042 --> 00:22:11.978
They shared what's called
a moon season.

530
00:22:11.978 --> 00:22:14.310
In real life.
you might call it a fling.

531
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.148
Um. brief but very intense.

532
00:22:17.148 --> 00:22:19.689
And... hopeful.

533
00:22:20.956 --> 00:22:23.429
Now. neither of them
had ever been in a relationship

534
00:22:23.429 --> 00:22:25.398
that deep before.

535
00:22:25.398 --> 00:22:28.258
And they told each other that
over and over and over again.

536
00:22:28.258 --> 00:22:30.260
Him more than her.
you know. to the point where

537
00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.064
sometimes she was like.
"Chill out." you know.

538
00:22:32.064 --> 00:22:34.770
But anyway.
in a tragic turn of events.

539
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:39.907
Space Cowboy is wounded.
and he just disappears.

540
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.580
Without a trace.

541
00:22:48.115 --> 00:22:49.455
I can keep going.

542
00:22:49.455 --> 00:22:51.787
I can hit the rock
better now. thanks.

543
00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:52.953
We're going again!

544
00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.595
Sound speed.

545
00:22:57.595 --> 00:22:59.388
And action!

546
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.898
-That's a cut!

547
00:23:03.898 --> 00:23:05.537
Cutting there. please.

548
00:23:08.133 --> 00:23:09.640
-Everything okay?
-You good?

549
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.873
For a little more
context. Colt.

550
00:23:11.873 --> 00:23:13.644
Aliena's sort of devastated.

551
00:23:13.644 --> 00:23:15.745
And she starts sort of
replaying everything

552
00:23:15.745 --> 00:23:17.109
in her head over and over again.

553
00:23:17.109 --> 00:23:19.210
Did she misread the vibe?

554
00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.651
Was it just a fling?

555
00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:23.588
Did she let her imagination
run wild again?

556
00:23:23.588 --> 00:23:25.557
Or did he lie to her?

557
00:23:25.557 --> 00:23:27.625
Was he full of shit?

558
00:23:29.596 --> 00:23:30.958
But let me be clear:

559
00:23:30.958 --> 00:23:32.993
eventually. Aliena did move on.

560
00:23:32.993 --> 00:23:34.929
All right?

561
00:23:34.929 --> 00:23:37.228
And she started doing Pilates.

562
00:23:37.228 --> 00:23:40.803
Got herself
a banging revenge body.

563
00:23:40.803 --> 00:23:43.003
and then she started dating
other humans.

564
00:23:43.003 --> 00:23:45.104
One after another.

565
00:23:45.104 --> 00:23:47.238
And she had
so many mind-blowing.

566
00:23:47.238 --> 00:23:50.439
far superior experiences.
you wouldn't even believe it.

567
00:23:50.439 --> 00:23:51.781
- Right. girls?
- Yeah.

568
00:23:51.781 --> 00:23:53.442
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:23:53.442 --> 00:23:54.751
Yeah. it was like a sushi train.

570
00:23:54.751 --> 00:23:57.413
I'm gonna be sick.

571
00:23:57.413 --> 00:23:59.151
And do you know what?
We're gonna go again. Colt.

572
00:23:59.151 --> 00:24:00.988
'cause there was
a little buzz on that one.

573
00:24:00.988 --> 00:24:02.462
Okay. light him up.

574
00:24:03.487 --> 00:24:05.597
Last one. everybody. Action!

575
00:24:08.831 --> 00:24:11.262
It-It's just feeling
so withheld.

576
00:24:11.262 --> 00:24:13.198
so how 'bout some dialogue?

577
00:24:13.198 --> 00:24:14.606
Yeah. that's all right. Darla.

578
00:24:14.606 --> 00:24:16.300
I'm gonna go
straight to the source.

579
00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.644
Hey. Colt. if Space Cowboy
had to say something.

580
00:24:19.644 --> 00:24:22.779
if he was forced to say
something. what would he say?

581
00:24:22.779 --> 00:24:24.308
How would he justify

582
00:24:24.308 --> 00:24:26.013
this year she's spent
spinning out over this?

583
00:24:26.013 --> 00:24:27.850
What could he say?
It's a puzzler. isn't it?

584
00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:30.116
- But have you got any thoughts?
- Uh. maybe he could talk...

585
00:24:30.116 --> 00:24:31.557
Nigel. can you. can you
get him a bullhorn?

586
00:24:31.557 --> 00:24:33.449
I can't hear him.

587
00:24:33.449 --> 00:24:34.659
Traveling.

588
00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:45.329
Come again. Colt.
What was that?

589
00:24:45.329 --> 00:24:47.573
- It's already on.
-  In this movie.

590
00:24:47.573 --> 00:24:51.302
do the aliens and the humans
ever talk...

591
00:24:51.302 --> 00:24:52.743
in private?

592
00:24:53.845 --> 00:24:55.746
- No. not really.
- No private conversations?

593
00:24:55.746 --> 00:24:57.308
No. they don't like
doing private.

594
00:24:57.308 --> 00:24:58.650
Like. they like
to keep it very public.

595
00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.344
- Very open.
- Oh.

596
00:25:02.348 --> 00:25:06.757
Well. maybe I'll just. uh.
open it up to the group here.

597
00:25:06.757 --> 00:25:10.420
Have you ever been in one of
those situations where...

598
00:25:11.698 --> 00:25:13.665
...you want to say something
and it's so important

599
00:25:13.665 --> 00:25:15.392
that you can't mess it up?

600
00:25:15.392 --> 00:25:20.397
So. you think
long and hard about it.

601
00:25:20.397 --> 00:25:22.839
and then you realize...

602
00:25:22.839 --> 00:25:24.676
you've already messed it up?

603
00:25:24.676 --> 00:25:29.373
'Cause you've thought
too long and too hard about it?

604
00:25:30.783 --> 00:25:32.442
You're...

605
00:25:32.442 --> 00:25:33.949
What's that?

606
00:25:35.117 --> 00:25:37.216
- You want...

607
00:25:41.627 --> 00:25:43.222
I had a similar situation

608
00:25:43.222 --> 00:25:45.455
when I fell in love
with my wife's sister.

609
00:25:45.455 --> 00:25:46.929
- Okay. All right. What...
- No.

610
00:25:46.929 --> 00:25:49.261
- No. Okay.

611
00:25:49.261 --> 00:25:51.263
Uh...

612
00:25:51.263 --> 00:25:53.771
And again.
this is hard because...

613
00:25:53.771 --> 00:25:55.641
you know. I haven't
read the script.

614
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:57.137
But...

615
00:25:59.205 --> 00:26:01.273
...he'd probably say...

616
00:26:02.914 --> 00:26:04.980
...that he's been living...

617
00:26:07.281 --> 00:26:09.655
...in total regret since then.

618
00:26:11.087 --> 00:26:12.790
You know. afraid...

619
00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.726
that he'll never get
an opportunity

620
00:26:14.726 --> 00:26:16.453
to make it up to her...

621
00:26:18.028 --> 00:26:19.555
...because he waited too long.

622
00:26:19.555 --> 00:26:21.161
And...

623
00:26:23.935 --> 00:26:25.803
...she's probably moved on.

624
00:26:25.803 --> 00:26:27.299
Uh. sorry. Jody.

625
00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:29.939
speaking of moving on.
we. uh...

626
00:26:31.844 --> 00:26:33.811
One more?

627
00:26:38.609 --> 00:26:40.653
I'd love another chance.

628
00:26:44.219 --> 00:26:46.186
- Roll it. Nigel.
- Let's turn over. please!

629
00:26:46.186 --> 00:26:48.023
- All cameras are rolling.
- Shot's up. sound speeding.

630
00:26:48.023 --> 00:26:49.222
Okay. light him up!

631
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:53.292
Action! Thank you!

632
00:27:00.741 --> 00:27:02.301
Gail?

633
00:27:04.041 --> 00:27:05.942
Gail?

634
00:27:05.942 --> 00:27:08.109
Oh. Coffee.

635
00:27:16.581 --> 00:27:18.515
Mm! You're here.

636
00:27:18.515 --> 00:27:19.857
Oh. no. don't use that.
It's broken.

637
00:27:19.857 --> 00:27:22.453
Eight and a half rolls?

638
00:27:22.453 --> 00:27:25.456
That is a world record!

639
00:27:25.456 --> 00:27:28.393
Thank you so much.

640
00:27:28.393 --> 00:27:31.066
It's better than parking cars.
isn't it?

641
00:27:32.628 --> 00:27:34.564
- Would you cut the shit. Gail?

642
00:27:34.564 --> 00:27:36.709
What? It was amazing.
What are you talking about?

643
00:27:36.709 --> 00:27:39.008
She doesn't want me here. Gail.

644
00:27:39.008 --> 00:27:40.372
Yes. she does.

645
00:27:40.372 --> 00:27:41.978
Oh. of course she does.

646
00:27:41.978 --> 00:27:44.816
- You lied. You lied.
- Oh.

647
00:27:44.816 --> 00:27:46.752
- Colt.
- Do you know how that feels?

648
00:27:46.752 --> 00:27:48.721
I think you deserve
a second chance.

649
00:27:48.721 --> 00:27:52.549
It's. like. the message
in all my movies.

650
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:54.188
What's the message
in all my movies?

651
00:27:54.188 --> 00:27:56.520
Uh...

652
00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.797
Nihilism's a viable worldview?

653
00:28:00.427 --> 00:28:03.065
No. that's just
the entertainment.

654
00:28:03.065 --> 00:28:05.067
That's like the...

655
00:28:05.067 --> 00:28:06.937
like the sexy bacon.

656
00:28:06.937 --> 00:28:08.840
- What is this?
- You know? It's like dogs.

657
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.700
You got to wrap the message...

658
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.636
in some sexy bacon.

659
00:28:14.881 --> 00:28:17.343
I mean. all those movies.
people fall down.

660
00:28:17.343 --> 00:28:19.279
They're rolling
in their own shit.

661
00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:21.512
They don't think they can cope.
but they can. They get back up.

662
00:28:21.512 --> 00:28:23.349
Do you mind if I lay down?

663
00:28:23.349 --> 00:28:26.187
With the multiple fire burns
and the cannon rolls

664
00:28:26.187 --> 00:28:28.794
- and the jet lag. I just...
- Yep. yep. yep.

665
00:28:28.794 --> 00:28:30.290
...could use a little shut-eye.

666
00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.423
Yep.

667
00:28:31.423 --> 00:28:33.062
Okay. let me get this straight.

668
00:28:34.263 --> 00:28:37.231
- Nihilism is the sexy bacon?
- Yeah.

669
00:28:37.231 --> 00:28:39.035
The audience are dogs?

670
00:28:39.035 --> 00:28:40.432
There we go.

671
00:28:40.432 --> 00:28:43.600
And when you fall down.
you get back up.

672
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.470
- Thank you.
- I'm glad we did this.

673
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.605
Now. what am I
really doing here. Gail?

674
00:28:50.642 --> 00:28:52.477
Um...

675
00:28:52.477 --> 00:28:53.577
Ryder's missing.

676
00:28:53.577 --> 00:28:55.117
He has fallen in

677
00:28:55.117 --> 00:28:58.318
with some shady.
shitty. shitty people.

678
00:28:58.318 --> 00:29:00.518
Well. Gail...

679
00:29:01.752 --> 00:29:03.125
...call the cops.

680
00:29:03.125 --> 00:29:04.489
I can't call the cops.

681
00:29:04.489 --> 00:29:06.062
Well. why not?

682
00:29:06.062 --> 00:29:08.757
The studio will know
that I am way over budget.

683
00:29:08.757 --> 00:29:10.429
They will pull the plug on this.

684
00:29:10.429 --> 00:29:12.937
You know that.

685
00:29:12.937 --> 00:29:14.235
Please go and find him.

686
00:29:14.235 --> 00:29:15.566
Why me?

687
00:29:15.566 --> 00:29:17.601
You're a stuntman.
for God's sake.

688
00:29:17.601 --> 00:29:19.768
No one's gonna notice
whether you're here or not.

689
00:29:19.768 --> 00:29:21.638
- No offense.
- I mean. some taken.

690
00:29:21.638 --> 00:29:24.410
You know him intimately.

691
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.115
It can be so simple.

692
00:29:26.115 --> 00:29:28.953
You pick him up.
you dust him off.

693
00:29:28.953 --> 00:29:30.251
you bring him back here.

694
00:29:30.251 --> 00:29:31.857
I know I can trust you.

695
00:29:31.857 --> 00:29:33.518
And you know who can
trust you more than anyone.

696
00:29:33.518 --> 00:29:36.422
she just doesn't
realize it yet. is Jody.

697
00:29:36.422 --> 00:29:39.359
This is her big chance.

698
00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:42.164
Do you want her first movie
to be her last?

699
00:29:42.164 --> 00:29:44.496
You've got to help me out. man.

700
00:29:45.906 --> 00:29:48.500
It's been a long couple days.

701
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.470
I'm gonna go to the hotel.
I'm gonna--

702
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.209
What is it? It's my yesterday.
it's your tomor--

703
00:29:54.209 --> 00:29:55.639
I'm gonna call you
your tomorrow.

704
00:29:55.639 --> 00:29:57.377
- Right. no. Today.
- My today.

705
00:29:57.377 --> 00:29:59.016
That is the door code
of Ryder's loft.

706
00:29:59.016 --> 00:30:00.952
The patio door.
Took it from his trailer.

707
00:30:00.952 --> 00:30:02.954
He's still doing
this Post-it note thing?

708
00:30:02.954 --> 00:30:05.022
Oh.
Let's not even get into that.

709
00:30:05.022 --> 00:30:07.783
At this point.
it's like <i>Memento</i> level.

710
00:30:07.783 --> 00:30:10.324
I can only keep this
from Jody and the studio

711
00:30:10.324 --> 00:30:12.557
48 hours max.

712
00:30:12.557 --> 00:30:14.130
Save Jody's movie.

713
00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.660
and maybe you get
the love of your life back.

714
00:30:18.268 --> 00:30:20.829
Did you just turn Jody
into the sexy bacon?

715
00:30:20.829 --> 00:30:23.975
She's been
the sexy bacon all along.

716
00:30:23.975 --> 00:30:25.372
You're good.

717
00:30:25.372 --> 00:30:27.605
It's the only left-hand drive
I have.

718
00:30:29.378 --> 00:30:31.543
Please don't wreck it.
It's product placement.

719
00:30:31.543 --> 00:30:34.051
There's only two of them.

720
00:30:34.051 --> 00:30:36.284
I know how you stunties drive.

721
00:30:39.388 --> 00:30:42.092

Uh. just. uh. chilling down.

00:32:17.649 --> 00:32:19.519
Were you "chilling down"
to Taylor Swift?

741
00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:21.488
- Yep.
- Mm.

742
00:32:21.488 --> 00:32:23.325
It's just something
Australians say.

743
00:32:23.325 --> 00:32:24.755
Really? I've been here for six
months. I've never heard it.

744
00:32:24.755 --> 00:32:26.196
Yeah. "chilling down under."
you know.

745
00:32:26.196 --> 00:32:27.527
but it's shorter to say
"chilling down."

746
00:32:27.527 --> 00:32:29.694
- Have you been crying?
- Not at all.

747
00:32:29.694 --> 00:32:31.234
You look like
you've been crying.

748
00:32:32.831 --> 00:32:34.699
Jet lag.

749
00:32:34.699 --> 00:32:37.636
That was so dangerous.
and I'm very sorry.

750
00:32:37.636 --> 00:32:39.704
Lighting you up like that.

751
00:32:39.704 --> 00:32:42.113
It was very cathartic.

752
00:32:42.113 --> 00:32:44.247
- I feel better.
- I deserved it.

753
00:32:46.647 --> 00:32:49.813
I'm gonna make the camera
up to you. by the way.

754
00:32:49.813 --> 00:32:52.057
Can I get in the car with you?

755
00:32:54.259 --> 00:32:56.490
Clean your face. You're a mess.

756
00:32:59.825 --> 00:33:01.231
So how have you been?

757
00:33:01.231 --> 00:33:03.662
Oh. you know.

758
00:33:05.336 --> 00:33:06.830
Yeah? Thumbs-up?

759
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.701
God. I hate that bullshit.
that stunt guy bullshit.

760
00:33:11.111 --> 00:33:12.308
- And that's fine.

761
00:33:12.308 --> 00:33:13.672
You don't have to
explain anything.

762
00:33:13.672 --> 00:33:15.476
It's all good. It was a fling.

763
00:33:15.476 --> 00:33:17.577
Less than a fling. It was
a flingette. and that's fine.

764
00:33:17.577 --> 00:33:19.381
I don't even want to know.

765
00:33:19.381 --> 00:33:21.845
And the problem with forcing
something is you get nowhere.

766
00:33:21.845 --> 00:33:23.682
You know. one time my mom
forced my dad to exercise.

767
00:33:23.682 --> 00:33:25.486
Do you know what happened?

768
00:33:25.486 --> 00:33:27.389
Snapped his ankle first time
he stepped on the treadmill.

769
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:29.985
She forced it. now he has
a piece of metal in his foot.

770
00:33:29.985 --> 00:33:32.196
Moral of the story is
you should just be you.

771
00:33:34.959 --> 00:33:36.926
Well. look. I've thought
a lot about this. actually.

772
00:33:36.926 --> 00:33:38.400
and I. uh...

773
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.698
It's not like
I didn't want to apologize

774
00:33:39.698 --> 00:33:41.700
a million times.

775
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.866
Yeah.

776
00:33:42.866 --> 00:33:45.407
Uh. it's just. every time I...

777
00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:51.710
You know. when I think of
something to say...

778
00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:56.616
...doesn't seem like enough.

779
00:34:01.887 --> 00:34:03.524
Okay.

780
00:34:03.524 --> 00:34:05.361
No problem.

781
00:34:05.361 --> 00:34:08.298
Boundaries. Boundaries.

782
00:34:08.298 --> 00:34:09.629
That's important.

783
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:11.433
Because I have
a lot of pressure on me.

784
00:34:11.433 --> 00:34:15.305
You have no idea how hard it was
for me to make this movie. okay?

785
00:34:15.305 --> 00:34:17.406
I just need to focus.
so if you're gonna stay here.

786
00:34:17.406 --> 00:34:19.705
we need to keep it...

787
00:34:19.705 --> 00:34:21.179
like. super profesh.

788
00:34:22.248 --> 00:34:23.577
"Professional"
is my middle name.

789
00:34:23.577 --> 00:34:25.513
Mm-hmm.

790
00:34:27.484 --> 00:34:29.044
I thought your middle name
was "Danger."

791
00:34:29.044 --> 00:34:31.750

00:38:43.837 --> 00:38:45.234
- I'm Ryder's girlfriend.
- Oh.

858
00:38:45.234 --> 00:38:46.741
- You're in <i>Metalstorm.</i>
- Yeah.

859
00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:48.204
Hey. were you
in that movie <i>Carjacked</i>

860
00:38:48.204 --> 00:38:49.678
where that guy named Jack
steals your car

861
00:38:49.678 --> 00:38:51.009
and then you shoot him
in the hand and you say.

862
00:38:51.009 --> 00:38:52.384
"I hope you know
how to drive stick"?

863
00:38:52.384 --> 00:38:54.078
And it doesn't make sense
'cause it's like.

864
00:38:54.078 --> 00:38:55.849
should be "automatic."
but the way you say it...

865
00:38:55.849 --> 00:38:57.356
That's Naomi Watts!

866
00:39:03.021 --> 00:39:04.220
I'm just a stunt guy.

867
00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.222
I'm working on <i>Metalstorm.</i> too.

868
00:39:06.222 --> 00:39:09.225
You lie!
We're only on <i>Metalstorm 1.</i>

869
00:39:09.225 --> 00:39:11.062
- I meant also!

870
00:39:29.212 --> 00:39:30.752
Is this a prop sword?

871
00:39:30.752 --> 00:39:33.458
Mm-hmm. I'm a good actress.

872
00:39:33.458 --> 00:39:36.626
Hey. if you are
really working on <i>Metalstorm.</i>

873
00:39:36.626 --> 00:39:38.122
why are you
sneaking around here?

874
00:39:38.122 --> 00:39:40.058
Just trying to find Ryder.

875
00:39:40.058 --> 00:39:42.533
He's. like. really drugged up
and paranoid right now.

876
00:39:42.533 --> 00:39:44.359
He thinks someone's
trying to kill him.

877
00:39:44.359 --> 00:39:47.263
And I'm like. "If you don't
finish <i>Metalstorm.</i>

878
00:39:47.263 --> 00:39:49.771
I'm gonna kill you myself."

879
00:39:49.771 --> 00:39:51.971
Now. there is
some dark shit going on.

880
00:39:51.971 --> 00:39:54.303
And the sooner I can get
out of here. the better.

881
00:39:55.845 --> 00:39:57.779
Wow.

882
00:39:57.779 --> 00:39:59.649
Any idea where I could find him?

883
00:39:59.649 --> 00:40:02.487
Uh. you could try this club
he hangs out at.

884
00:40:02.487 --> 00:40:05.281
But you're never gonna get in
looking like a povo.

885
00:40:05.281 --> 00:40:07.954
- What's a povo?
- A poor person like you.

886
00:40:07.954 --> 00:40:09.989
Oh. Cool.

887
00:40:09.989 --> 00:40:13.157
What's with your
<i>Miami Vice</i> Stunt Team jacket?

888
00:40:13.157 --> 00:40:14.796
Oh. it was
the first show I ever did.

889
00:40:14.796 --> 00:40:18.228
I had to jump a boat
through a ring of fire.

890
00:40:18.228 --> 00:40:19.636
I got so good I could do it

891
00:40:19.636 --> 00:40:20.934
with my hands
tied behind my back.

892
00:40:22.432 --> 00:40:23.607
Wow.

893
00:40:23.607 --> 00:40:25.433
You're really into yourself.

894
00:40:27.105 --> 00:40:29.074
I mean. you know. you did ask.

895
00:40:29.074 --> 00:40:30.746
It's neon night at the club.

896
00:40:30.746 --> 00:40:32.143
<i>He's always there
with this guy called Doone</i>

897
00:40:32.143 --> 00:40:33.749
<i>who's his drug dealer.</i>

898
00:40:33.749 --> 00:40:35.344
<i>He's got. like.
leopard print tats on his head.</i>

899
00:40:35.344 --> 00:40:37.852
<i>They won't let a nobody
like you into the club.</i>

900
00:40:37.852 --> 00:40:39.788
<i>so just act like Tom.
You're his stunt double.</i>

901
00:40:39.788 --> 00:40:41.416
You know how to do that.
don't you?

902
00:40:41.416 --> 00:40:43.253
Yeah. I'll just act like
I own everything and everyone

903
00:40:43.253 --> 00:40:45.530
and there's no repercussions
for my actions.

904
00:40:47.455 --> 00:40:49.633
♪ I do it like that... ♪

905
00:40:50.997 --> 00:40:53.934
Oh. my God. Is that Tom Ryder?

906
00:40:53.934 --> 00:40:55.199
Hey. Tom!

907
00:40:57.267 --> 00:40:59.335
Stuntman! Yeah. yeah. Iggy said
you were gonna come see me.

908
00:40:59.335 --> 00:41:00.842
Yeah. sit down. get a drink.

909
00:41:00.842 --> 00:41:01.975
Hey. hey. get him a drink.
What do you want?

910
00:41:01.975 --> 00:41:03.438
Oh. no. no. I'm good. I'm good.

911
00:41:03.438 --> 00:41:05.484
I'm just looking for Ryder.
You seen him?

912
00:41:06.916 --> 00:41:09.114
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Sit down. brother. sit down.

913
00:41:09.114 --> 00:41:11.446
Uh. honestly. no offense.
Mr. Doone.

914
00:41:11.446 --> 00:41:13.316
I just want to find Ryder.

915
00:41:13.316 --> 00:41:16.253
How come no one ever wants
to chat with the drug dealer?

916
00:41:19.423 --> 00:41:21.962
Sorry. I. uh...

917
00:41:21.962 --> 00:41:24.492
I mean no... no disrespect.

918
00:41:24.492 --> 00:41:26.494
Just had a long day.
Ryder hasn't shown up to work.

919
00:41:26.494 --> 00:41:28.166
That was fast.

920
00:41:28.166 --> 00:41:29.640
You do a stunt today?

921
00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.235
Uh. just a. yeah. car roll.

922
00:41:31.235 --> 00:41:32.742
- Just a car roll?

923
00:41:32.742 --> 00:41:35.008
Hear how he said that?
"Just a car roll!"

924
00:41:35.008 --> 00:41:36.911
What a stuntman! My man!

925
00:41:36.911 --> 00:41:38.682
It's what I do.

926
00:41:38.682 --> 00:41:39.848
Hey. that's why I like you.

927
00:41:39.848 --> 00:41:41.410
'Cause you do all the hard shit.

928
00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:44.017
They give Oscars for that?

929
00:41:44.017 --> 00:41:45.920
For stunts?

930
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.724
No.

931
00:41:47.724 --> 00:41:49.154
Nope.

932
00:41:49.154 --> 00:41:51.321
Hey. to the unsung heroes.

933
00:41:51.321 --> 00:41:53.125
- I'll drink to that.
-  Yeah.

934
00:41:55.228 --> 00:41:56.997
Mm!

935
00:41:58.361 --> 00:42:00.033
No offense.
but I prefer cartoons.

936
00:42:00.033 --> 00:42:02.871
See. movies are always trying
to make things real.

937
00:42:02.871 --> 00:42:04.675
But it's not real.
It's a movie.

938
00:42:04.675 --> 00:42:06.534
It's not meant to be real.

939
00:42:06.534 --> 00:42:08.272
- That's why I like cartoons.

940
00:42:08.272 --> 00:42:09.537
See. 'cause cartoons

941
00:42:09.537 --> 00:42:10.780
don't pretend to be real.

942
00:42:12.441 --> 00:42:14.410
That's what I like about them.
You seen <i>Dumbo?</i>

943
00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:15.950
<i>- Dumbo?</i>
- Yeah. <i>Dumbo.</i>

944
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.853
<i>Dumbo</i> changed my life.

945
00:42:17.853 --> 00:42:20.086
You know that scene when Dumbo
gets into the bad champagne.

946
00:42:20.086 --> 00:42:21.417
then he starts seeing
the pink elephants

947
00:42:21.417 --> 00:42:22.418
on parade and shit?

948
00:42:22.418 --> 00:42:23.628
I was like. "Yes. please.

949
00:42:23.628 --> 00:42:25.091
"I'll have what he's having!

950
00:42:25.091 --> 00:42:26.521
Make it a double!"

951
00:42:27.731 --> 00:42:29.601
Hey. stuntman?

952
00:42:29.601 --> 00:42:31.295
- Why don't you come with us?

953
00:42:31.295 --> 00:42:33.737
We'll get you nice and
comfortable at the hotel. huh?

954
00:43:19.213 --> 00:43:22.214
Move. move! Get out of the way!
Get-- Move! Come on!

955
00:43:23.547 --> 00:43:26.251
Get out the way!
Move! Get off me!

956
00:43:26.251 --> 00:43:27.516
Hey!

957
00:43:31.962 --> 00:43:33.423
Let's go. let's go. let's go!
Taxi! Come on. come on.

958
00:43:33.423 --> 00:43:34.831
Come on. brother. let's go.

959
00:43:34.831 --> 00:43:37.163
- Go! -See you. mate.
- Be well. mate.

960
00:43:47.307 --> 00:43:48.977
What are you doing. Colt?

961
00:43:48.977 --> 00:43:51.474
You know what I'm doing.
I'm gonna stop this car.

962
00:43:51.474 --> 00:43:54.279
You're clearly high. Colt.
And you're clearly chickenshit!

963
00:43:54.279 --> 00:43:56.347
Okay. we don't have time for
this. Talk about this later.

964
00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:06.995
Yeah. okay. -DOONE:
Driver. what are you doing?

965
00:44:06.995 --> 00:44:09.294
Drive! Drive. bro!

966
00:44:09.294 --> 00:44:11.164
Listen. Hey. you need to chill.
Just relax. Just re--

967
00:44:11.164 --> 00:44:12.968
Hey. just relax! I'm a lover.
not a fighter. okay? Just...

968
00:44:12.968 --> 00:44:14.200
- Where's Ryder?!
- I just drugged you

969
00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.333
'cause they paid me to.

970
00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:16.807
- Who's "they"?

971
00:44:16.807 --> 00:44:18.468
The guy that runs
Ryder's security.

972
00:44:18.468 --> 00:44:19.744
I deliver drugs to him

973
00:44:19.744 --> 00:44:21.240
at the Pendleton Hotel
sometimes. okay?

974
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.175
- What room?
- Bro. I don't know what room.

975
00:44:22.175 --> 00:44:23.715
You know. it changes.

976
00:44:23.715 --> 00:44:24.914
Just ask Kevin
for the. for the fruit plate.

977
00:44:24.914 --> 00:44:26.476
- He'll give you the key.
- Kevin?

978
00:44:26.476 --> 00:44:27.917
- Kevin! K-E-V-I-N. For the...
- I know Kevin!

979
00:44:27.917 --> 00:44:28.984
You know Kevin?

980
00:44:28.984 --> 00:44:30.480
I don't know Kevin.

981
00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.086
Well. then you're gonna
get to know Kevin.

982
00:44:32.086 --> 00:44:35.188
Ask him for a fruit plate.
and he'll give you keys.

983
00:44:35.188 --> 00:44:36.651
How long does this last?

984
00:44:36.651 --> 00:44:38.191
- What?
- How long is this gonna last?

985
00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:39.324
Bro. what are you even saying?

986
00:44:39.324 --> 00:44:42.261
How... long does this last?

987
00:44:42.261 --> 00:44:45.099
Oh. When you stop
seeing unicorns.

988
00:44:49.565 --> 00:44:52.238
I'd like to speak to Kevin.

989
00:44:52.238 --> 00:44:54.504
Kevin's. uh. on a break.

990
00:44:54.504 --> 00:44:57.914
Okay. maybe you can help me.
Can I order the "fruit plate"?

991
00:44:57.914 --> 00:45:01.786
Okay. Do you want me
to call "room service"?

992
00:45:01.786 --> 00:45:03.678
I don't know.
Is that what happens?

993
00:45:03.678 --> 00:45:04.888
D-Do you have a room?

994
00:45:04.888 --> 00:45:06.384
- Should I just...
- Do I need one?

995
00:45:06.384 --> 00:45:07.682
To order the fr...

996
00:45:07.682 --> 00:45:08.793
- I...
- The fruit plate.

997
00:45:08.793 --> 00:45:09.827
- Hey. Colt.
- Fruit plate.

998
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:11.895
Woof. wow.

999
00:45:11.895 --> 00:45:13.963
- That's a look.
- Hi. Hey.

1000
00:45:13.963 --> 00:45:15.294
- What happened to your face?
- Hi.

1001
00:45:15.294 --> 00:45:16.867
- Hi. Okay.

1002
00:45:16.867 --> 00:45:18.363
- Sorry about that.
- Are you good?

1003
00:45:18.363 --> 00:45:19.870
- It's just good...
- What's wrong with you?

1004
00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:20.772
- It's good to see you.
- Wow. you look terrible.

1005
00:45:20.772 --> 00:45:22.103
You look amazing.

1006
00:45:22.103 --> 00:45:23.566
Did you fall?
What happened to you?

1007
00:45:23.566 --> 00:45:25.271
Wow. You're so pretty.

1008
00:45:25.271 --> 00:45:26.635
-  It's crazy.
- Okay. Your face is bleeding.

1009
00:45:26.635 --> 00:45:28.604
- What?
- What happened to you?

1010
00:45:28.604 --> 00:45:30.639
Oh. No. I was running.
Just-- I was running.

1011
00:45:30.639 --> 00:45:32.949
Very unusual athleisure wear
for a run.

1012
00:45:32.949 --> 00:45:34.577
-  This?
- Yeah.

1013
00:45:34.577 --> 00:45:37.118
Yeah. they gave me
the wrong bags at the airport.

1014
00:45:37.118 --> 00:45:38.449
but. you know. it's-- it works.

1015
00:45:38.449 --> 00:45:39.956
I can sweat.

1016
00:45:39.956 --> 00:45:41.452
If I'm gonna play Ryder.
I thought I should just.

1017
00:45:41.452 --> 00:45:42.794
like. cut weight a little.
you know...

1018
00:45:42.794 --> 00:45:43.960
You seem kind of tweaky.

1019
00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.556
I'm a little... spotty.

1020
00:45:46.556 --> 00:45:49.229
Like. when I--
my glucose levels get low.

1021
00:45:49.229 --> 00:45:50.901
I get a little...

1022
00:45:50.901 --> 00:45:53.761
- Okay. is that a new thing?

1023
00:45:53.761 --> 00:45:55.301
Is that a new thing?

1024
00:45:55.301 --> 00:45:56.599
- What's that?
- Is that a new thing?

1025
00:45:56.599 --> 00:45:58.271
- Is your hair new?
- Yes. I cut it.

1026
00:45:58.271 --> 00:45:59.635
- I changed my hair.
- It's beautiful.

1027
00:45:59.635 --> 00:46:01.142
You changed your number.
We're even.

1028
00:46:01.142 --> 00:46:03.507
I thought we'd sort of
even the score.

1029
00:46:03.507 --> 00:46:05.410
Yeah. I have a lot of new s--

1030
00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:06.950
You know. I've learned
a lot about myself

1031
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:09.117
since-since we last
seen each other.

1032
00:46:09.117 --> 00:46:10.855
Why'd you disappear like that?

1033
00:46:10.855 --> 00:46:13.055
God. I wanted
to be there for you.

1034
00:46:14.553 --> 00:46:16.652
Yeah. but how's
she supposed to do quality work

1035
00:46:16.652 --> 00:46:18.093
if you keep harassing her
all the time?

1036
00:46:20.425 --> 00:46:22.493
Okay. Can you go
and grab your things?

1037
00:46:22.493 --> 00:46:24.836
- We have really got to zip.
- Okay. Yep.

1038
00:46:24.836 --> 00:46:26.200
- What's going on?
- Seriously.

1039
00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:29.005
- Colt. you're...

1040
00:46:29.005 --> 00:46:30.369
You look like you've been busy.

1041
00:46:30.369 --> 00:46:32.635
- Yeah. real busy. Gail.
- Yeah. good.

1042
00:46:32.635 --> 00:46:33.845
Lot of running around. Gail.

1043
00:46:33.845 --> 00:46:35.770
We'll get a drink
and discuss that.

1044
00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:37.310
But right now. the studio...

1045
00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:39.543
so far up my ass.
I can taste them.

1046
00:46:39.543 --> 00:46:41.116
- We need your third act.
- Okay. Yep.

1047
00:46:41.116 --> 00:46:42.711
You having problems
with the third act?

1048
00:46:42.711 --> 00:46:44.449
We're gonna. we're gonna go
and do things right now.

1049
00:46:44.449 --> 00:46:45.857
I need to write it.
I'm gonna go write it. I just--

1050
00:46:45.857 --> 00:46:47.551
It's like
the studio are wanting me

1051
00:46:47.551 --> 00:46:49.960
to contort the love story
so that it all ends happily

1052
00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.357
and everything's rosy and...

1053
00:46:51.357 --> 00:46:52.897
- Jody. Jody. Jody.
- But I feel like if I...

1054
00:46:52.897 --> 00:46:56.296
lean into reality.
then maybe that's the way to go.

1055
00:46:56.296 --> 00:46:59.068
And most love stories
don't end well. Usually.

1056
00:47:00.401 --> 00:47:02.731
- Know what I mean?
- I strongly disagree with that.

1057
00:47:02.731 --> 00:47:05.503
so we should keep
chopping it up.

1058
00:47:05.503 --> 00:47:06.735
Yeah? Should we?

1059
00:47:06.735 --> 00:47:08.913
It's important.
It's the ending.

1060
00:47:08.913 --> 00:47:10.574
- Okay.

1061
00:47:12.378 --> 00:47:14.083
Sir?

1062
00:47:14.083 --> 00:47:15.414
- Huh?
- Hi.

1063
00:47:15.414 --> 00:47:16.679
- Yeah.
- Hi.

1064
00:47:16.679 --> 00:47:18.681
Um. I hear that
you're interested

1065
00:47:18.681 --> 00:47:20.518
in a-a fruit platter.

1066
00:47:20.518 --> 00:47:21.992
-  Kevin?
-  Yes.

1067
00:47:21.992 --> 00:47:23.389
Yes. Okay. so...

1068
00:47:24.489 --> 00:47:26.898
It's-it's on... it's on ice.

1069
00:47:47.413 --> 00:47:49.745
Yep. There we go. Sorry.

1070
00:48:35.166 --> 00:48:36.825
Hello?

1071
00:48:36.825 --> 00:48:38.332
What do you
think about split screen?

1072
00:48:38.332 --> 00:48:40.400
- Jody?
- Yeah.

1073
00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.765
Is this okay I'm calling?
You said to call and...

1074
00:48:42.765 --> 00:48:45.174
- Yes. Yeah. it's fine.
- Yeah? We could chop it up?

1075
00:48:45.174 --> 00:48:47.242
It's. uh... Let's chop it up.

1076
00:48:47.242 --> 00:48:48.639
It's a good time.
I'm not doing anything.

1077
00:48:48.639 --> 00:48:51.774
Okay. Great.
Uh. so. split screen. right?

1078
00:48:51.774 --> 00:48:53.908
Do you think that it's.
like. nostalgic super cool

1079
00:48:53.908 --> 00:48:56.482
or do you think
it's a gimmick? -

1080
00:48:56.482 --> 00:48:59.287
Um. I think
it could be super cool.

1081
00:48:59.287 --> 00:49:02.092
Mm-hmm? -Yeah. how do you.
uh. want to use it?

1082
00:49:02.092 --> 00:49:04.490
I mean. you know. tell me.
Tell me everything.

1083
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:06.756
Tell me. you know.
about your vision.

1084
00:49:06.756 --> 00:49:08.692
So. I like that
they're on-screen together.

1085
00:49:08.692 --> 00:49:10.430
But they are in
separate worlds... -Right.

1086
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.531
...you know.
visually and emotionally.

1087
00:49:12.531 --> 00:49:14.764
So you've got
this very prominent divide

1088
00:49:14.764 --> 00:49:16.205
between the lovers.

1089
00:49:16.205 --> 00:49:17.668
And I want that.

1090
00:49:20.805 --> 00:49:23.410
- You want the divide?
- I want the divide. yes.

1091
00:49:26.085 --> 00:49:27.711
Hmm.

1092
00:49:27.711 --> 00:49:29.350
It's funny 'cause I-I didn't
get the impression

1093
00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:31.385
that there was that much
keeping them apart.

1094
00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:33.486
Well. you haven't
read the script.

1095
00:49:34.984 --> 00:49:37.193
All I know so far is that
the alien lady and the cowboy

1096
00:49:37.193 --> 00:49:41.494
are having what seem to be
pretty manageable problems.

1097
00:49:41.494 --> 00:49:44.299
Jody? Jod-- How's this?

1098
00:49:44.299 --> 00:49:45.894
Manageable problems?

1099
00:49:45.894 --> 00:49:47.995
The aliens invaded Earth.
and they left it in tatters.

1100
00:49:47.995 --> 00:49:49.667
So this whole thing
the studio are pushing for.

1101
00:49:49.667 --> 00:49:51.075
the "love conquers all"
thing...

1102
00:49:51.075 --> 00:49:53.704
I'm not buying it.

1103
00:49:53.704 --> 00:49:56.971
Well. I have to admit that I'm
surprised to hear you say that.

1104
00:49:56.971 --> 00:49:58.808
Why?

1105
00:49:58.808 --> 00:50:01.250
Well. I'm just
a boy in a neon suit

1106
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:03.219
standing in front of a girl.
reminding her

1107
00:50:03.219 --> 00:50:05.584
that <i>Notting Hill</i>
is her favorite movie

1108
00:50:05.584 --> 00:50:08.818
and she watches <i>Love Actually</i>
every year at Christmas.

1109
00:50:08.818 --> 00:50:10.556
Well. you know.
I watched it again this year.

1110
00:50:10.556 --> 00:50:13.262
and I didn't love it. actually.

1111
00:50:13.262 --> 00:50:15.099
- Wow. it's worse than I thought.
- Yeah. I'm ruined.

1112
00:50:15.099 --> 00:50:17.266
Yeah. it's a really sad day
for <i>Notting Hill</i> as well.

1113
00:50:17.266 --> 00:50:19.433
That "happily ever after"
stuff. unsubscribe me.

1114
00:50:19.433 --> 00:50:21.105
I didn't get "happily ever
after" from <i>Notting Hill.</i>

1115
00:50:21.105 --> 00:50:22.568
What are you talking about?
Of course you did.

1116
00:50:22.568 --> 00:50:24.405
- Did you?
- Yes. of course. They're ly--

1117
00:50:24.405 --> 00:50:26.209
They're on the park bench.
She's got her head in his knee.

1118
00:50:26.209 --> 00:50:27.408
She's a "regular girl."

1119
00:50:27.408 --> 00:50:28.937
Maybe. but we don't know
for sure

1120
00:50:28.937 --> 00:50:31.412
she's not gonna go back
to working the street.

1121
00:50:31.412 --> 00:50:32.941
All we know is that
in the beginning.

1122
00:50:32.941 --> 00:50:34.778
she's pretty much up for
anything but kissing.

1123
00:50:34.778 --> 00:50:36.417
and in the end.
she's open to kissing him.

1124
00:50:36.417 --> 00:50:38.518
-  No. No.
- And it gives us hope.

1125
00:50:38.518 --> 00:50:40.014
You have got your Julia Roberts
movies so twisted.

1126
00:50:40.014 --> 00:50:41.257
And that's all we want.
A little hope.

1127
00:50:41.257 --> 00:50:42.588
No. that is <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

1128
00:50:42.588 --> 00:50:43.853
where she is
a lady of the night.

1129
00:50:43.853 --> 00:50:45.195
and this is <i>Notting Hill.</i>

1130
00:50:45.195 --> 00:50:46.262
where she's
a very famous actress.

1131
00:50:46.262 --> 00:50:47.758
Oh. Well. don't listen to me.

1132
00:50:47.758 --> 00:50:49.892
What do I know?
Look. you're the director.

1133
00:50:49.892 --> 00:50:51.234
You're gonna make
the right choice.

1134
00:50:51.234 --> 00:50:53.137
I'm just saying.
for people like me.

1135
00:50:53.137 --> 00:50:54.963
who may not necessarily get the
metaphor of the split screen.

1136
00:50:54.963 --> 00:50:56.734
You may not get
the deeper metaphor.

1137
00:50:56.734 --> 00:50:58.241
but you're gonna see it.

1138
00:50:58.241 --> 00:50:59.935
You're gonna see
this bright line between them

1139
00:50:59.935 --> 00:51:02.905
that we're gonna ache
to see blur.

1140
00:51:02.905 --> 00:51:04.709
You know. but maybe it can't.

1141
00:51:04.709 --> 00:51:07.041
- Mm.
- Maybe it doesn't.

1142
00:51:07.041 --> 00:51:09.780
Right. Right. Yeah.

1143
00:51:11.551 --> 00:51:13.619
But what do we know. right?

1144
00:51:13.619 --> 00:51:15.258
'Cause all we know at this point

1145
00:51:15.258 --> 00:51:17.953
is that the cowboy
likes the alien.

1146
00:51:17.953 --> 00:51:19.394
Does the alien like the cowboy?

1147
00:51:19.394 --> 00:51:21.297
She's on the fence.

1148
00:51:21.297 --> 00:51:22.562
Right.

1149
00:51:22.562 --> 00:51:24.597
Because they got problems.

1150
00:51:24.597 --> 00:51:29.140
Because she's an alien and he's
a cowboy. and that's a problem.

1151
00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:30.768
But is it a problem
they can't overcome?

1152
00:51:30.768 --> 00:51:32.407
Here's a question.

1153
00:51:32.407 --> 00:51:35.245
Are they even gonna try?

1154
00:51:35.245 --> 00:51:36.774
What do you think?

1155
00:51:38.008 --> 00:51:40.041
Do you think they're gonna try?

1156
00:51:41.451 --> 00:51:43.814
I think...

1157
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:47.356
I think this was
a great brainstorm.

1158
00:51:50.823 --> 00:51:53.263
So...

1159
00:51:53.263 --> 00:51:55.793
what'd you decide
about the split screen?

1160
00:51:55.793 --> 00:51:57.630
I have a better idea.

1161
00:51:59.093 --> 00:52:00.930
I don't think you need it.

1162
00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:03.471
I think the connection between
these characters is so strong

1163
00:52:03.471 --> 00:52:05.572
that nothing can
come between them.

1164
00:52:06.971 --> 00:52:08.509
Jod?

1165
00:52:09.875 --> 00:52:11.039
Jody?

1166
00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:36.900
-Hello?
- Dead guy on ice.

1167
00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.539
What?

1168
00:52:38.539 --> 00:52:42.213
There's a dead guy on ice
at the hotel. Gail.

1169
00:52:42.213 --> 00:52:44.039
Wait. Sorry.
What are you talking about?

1170
00:52:44.039 --> 00:52:45.381
Well. if you think
that doesn't make sense.

1171
00:52:45.381 --> 00:52:47.317
- don't order the fruit plate.
- Hold on.

1172
00:52:47.317 --> 00:52:49.143
You're seriously telling me
you've just seen a dead body?

1173
00:52:49.143 --> 00:52:50.848
Yes. Gail.

1174
00:52:50.848 --> 00:52:53.422
On the rocks. In the hotel.

1175
00:52:53.422 --> 00:52:54.687
What hotel?

1176
00:52:54.687 --> 00:52:56.656
The one
I just saw you in. Gail!

1177
00:52:56.656 --> 00:52:58.229
He was so dead. Gail.

1178
00:52:58.229 --> 00:53:00.330
He was very dead. Super dead.

1179
00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:01.760
Hold on.
How did you even get there?

1180
00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.158
Gail. you asked me
to do this! Okay?

1181
00:53:04.158 --> 00:53:06.699
- So please try and keep up.
- I know. I'm sticking.

1182
00:53:06.699 --> 00:53:09.339
I went to Ryder's apartment
just like you told me.

1183
00:53:09.339 --> 00:53:11.737
That's where Iggy with
the sword gave me the neon suit

1184
00:53:11.737 --> 00:53:14.377
and they sent me to the man
with the leopard print head.

1185
00:53:14.377 --> 00:53:16.280
He goes by the name of Doone.

1186
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.172
It was Doone's goons
who dirtied my Shirley.

1187
00:53:18.172 --> 00:53:19.943
and not in a fun way. Gail.

1188
00:53:19.943 --> 00:53:22.209
I think they were
trying to kill me. Gail!

1189
00:53:22.209 --> 00:53:24.387
Step away and calm down.

1190
00:53:24.387 --> 00:53:26.048
I am gonna handle everything.

1191
00:53:26.048 --> 00:53:27.522
- No more handling!

1192
00:53:27.522 --> 00:53:29.392
- I want the police!
- You're very aggressive.

1193
00:53:29.392 --> 00:53:31.757
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to yell.
I want the police.

1194
00:53:31.757 --> 00:53:33.462
You are not gonna talk
to the police.

1195
00:53:33.462 --> 00:53:34.925
You don't talk to anyone
about this. okay? -

1196
00:53:34.925 --> 00:53:36.223
- You listen to me.
- I'm calling the police.

1197
00:53:36.223 --> 00:53:37.598
You are not
talking to the police.

1198
00:53:37.598 --> 00:53:39.094
- Excuse me. sir.
-Wait. who's there?

1199
00:53:39.094 --> 00:53:40.436
Who's there? Who's there?

1200
00:53:40.436 --> 00:53:41.767
It's the police.
I'm gonna talk to them.

1201
00:53:41.767 --> 00:53:42.999
No. no. no. no. no!
Don't talk...

1202
00:53:45.135 --> 00:53:47.971
No parking at any time.

1203
00:53:51.944 --> 00:53:54.109
Sorry.

1204
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:55.484
Just making sure
we're both here.

1205
00:53:56.454 --> 00:53:57.552
I'm-I'm here. mate.

1206
00:53:57.552 --> 00:53:59.455
I want to report a crime.

1207
00:53:59.455 --> 00:54:01.083
- Okay.
- An ice crime.

1208
00:54:07.221 --> 00:54:09.894
Yeah. You're still
getting a ticket. mate.

1209
00:54:09.894 --> 00:54:11.269
All right.

1210
00:54:14.835 --> 00:54:16.230
<i>I got to tell Jody.</i>

1211
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:17.572
About the dead guy.

1212
00:54:17.572 --> 00:54:18.837
How do you know he was dead?

1213
00:54:18.837 --> 00:54:20.267
He could've just been
knocked out.

1214
00:54:20.267 --> 00:54:21.675
- On ice?
- Yeah.

1215
00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:24.777
Ice baths are very good
for inflammation.

1216
00:54:24.777 --> 00:54:27.109
And are you forgetting
that you were high?

1217
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:28.781
How can I if you keep fixating

1218
00:54:28.781 --> 00:54:30.112
- on that one point?
- Okay. you know what.

1219
00:54:30.112 --> 00:54:31.685
let me just stop you
right there.

1220
00:54:31.685 --> 00:54:33.489
Whatever you told Jody
last night

1221
00:54:33.489 --> 00:54:34.952
- has got her all fired up.
- I don't know what I said.

1222
00:54:34.952 --> 00:54:36.360
About what?

1223
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.625
And now I have to build a truck

1224
00:54:37.625 --> 00:54:39.990
- for a 250-foot jump.
- Huh?

1225
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:41.926
- In a day and a half!
- Sounds pretty cool. actually.

1226
00:54:41.926 --> 00:54:44.159
And on top of that.
the fight scene today.

1227
00:54:44.159 --> 00:54:46.865
Jody has decided that she wants
to do it all in one take.

1228
00:54:46.865 --> 00:54:49.131
A oner. -JODY: Dan. did you
tell him about the oner?

1229
00:54:49.131 --> 00:54:50.440
- Yes.
- So cool.

1230
00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:51.639
- Right?
- Yeah.

1231
00:54:51.639 --> 00:54:53.300
- So good. He's into it.
- Hi.

1232
00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.972
Hey. Yeah. can I talk to you
for a second? -Okay.

1233
00:54:54.972 --> 00:54:57.612
about this sequence today.
Ryder's a no-show. -Yeah.

1234
00:54:57.612 --> 00:54:59.009
Again. he's probably on
a bender or something.

1235
00:54:59.009 --> 00:55:00.109
Well. it's interesting
you say that.

1236
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:01.847
- because that's...
- Yeah.

1237
00:55:01.847 --> 00:55:03.783
...that's what I want to talk
to you about. -Me. too.

1238
00:55:03.783 --> 00:55:05.620
Me. too. Because we don't even
need him. -He...

1239
00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:07.149
Well... -We don't need him.
I had an epiphany last night.

1240
00:55:07.149 --> 00:55:08.392
Let me just tell you.

1241
00:55:08.392 --> 00:55:09.987
- Last night?
- I was so excited.

1242
00:55:09.987 --> 00:55:12.396
Yeah. -After we spoke.
it all came to me.

1243
00:55:12.396 --> 00:55:14.222
Really? -Yeah.
the third act. this sequence.

1244
00:55:14.222 --> 00:55:16.158
- all of it. I've been s...
- After talking to me?

1245
00:55:16.158 --> 00:55:17.566
Yeah. You know. I was shocked

1246
00:55:17.566 --> 00:55:19.062
- when you showed up. Right?
- Yeah.

1247
00:55:19.062 --> 00:55:21.570
- But...
- Well. it was... shocking.

1248
00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:23.506
But I just started to wonder
if maybe

1249
00:55:23.506 --> 00:55:25.409
you showed up
just at the right time. and...

1250
00:55:25.409 --> 00:55:27.576
I've been going for this thing
in the action.

1251
00:55:27.576 --> 00:55:29.072
and I've never been able
to get it.

1252
00:55:29.072 --> 00:55:31.844
Like. this feeling
of the pursuit of love.

1253
00:55:31.844 --> 00:55:34.880
And how far would you go for
the one that you love and...

1254
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.685
-You know?
And then...

1255
00:55:37.685 --> 00:55:39.753
Yeah. -You know. I realize
it's not very far with Ryder.

1256
00:55:39.753 --> 00:55:41.183
- 'cause he's a drip.
- Right.

1257
00:55:41.183 --> 00:55:42.822
- And he runs weird.
- Right.

1258
00:55:42.822 --> 00:55:44.527
- And he can't do action. But...
- Well. it's...

1259
00:55:44.527 --> 00:55:45.924
...you can.

1260
00:55:45.924 --> 00:55:47.222
- You can.

1261
00:55:47.222 --> 00:55:48.762
I'm unlimited with you.

1262
00:55:48.762 --> 00:55:50.533
I can do everything
and everything with you.

1263
00:55:50.533 --> 00:55:52.095
and it just made my brain
just...

1264
00:55:53.228 --> 00:55:54.900
So cool.

1265
00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:56.231
I don't need cuts.
I don't need gimmicks. -Really?

1266
00:55:56.231 --> 00:55:58.233
I don't need anything.
I just need you.

1267
00:55:58.233 --> 00:55:59.938
- To finish this movie.

1268
00:55:59.938 --> 00:56:02.237
You know. maybe even make it
a great movie. -Wow.

1269
00:56:02.237 --> 00:56:03.579
You know?

1270
00:56:03.579 --> 00:56:05.779
- Wow. Okay.
- What do you think?

1271
00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:07.550
Do you want to work together?

1272
00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:10.047
Shoot the shit out of Sydney
Opera House in four hours?

1273
00:56:10.047 --> 00:56:11.752
- Three hours and 52 minutes.
- Three hours and 52 minutes?

1274
00:56:11.752 --> 00:56:13.083
Yeah.

1275
00:56:13.083 --> 00:56:14.524
What are we waiting for?

1276
00:56:14.524 --> 00:56:16.757
Okay. good.
Good! Okay!

1277
00:56:16.757 --> 00:56:18.561
Venti. Venti. come on.

1278
00:56:18.561 --> 00:56:20.464
I'm gonna get some dots
on your face. 'cause I need you

1279
00:56:20.464 --> 00:56:22.389
but not your face. -Oh. God.
Get-- Yeah. just get rid of it.

1280
00:56:22.389 --> 00:56:23.797
Yeah. I'm gonna stick Ryder's
head on you. -All of it. Just--

1281
00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:25.931
- Okay. Cool. Okay. okay.
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1282
00:56:25.931 --> 00:56:28.571
Ready for a take?
Make it rain. please!

1283

I don't know what that was.

1325
00:58:35.665 --> 00:58:37.062
That was just so awful and...

1326
00:58:37.062 --> 00:58:38.998

It's done. Forget.
You-you never saw it.

1330
00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:49.547
Jody. do you like
Christina or Britney?

1331
00:58:52.046 --> 00:58:53.716
I saw that.

1332
00:58:53.716 --> 00:58:56.620
- You saw the finger guns?
- Oh. I saw the finger guns.

1333
00:58:57.852 --> 00:58:59.282
She started it.

1334
00:58:59.282 --> 00:59:01.284
Hi.

1335
00:59:01.284 --> 00:59:03.088
I didn't ha--
I didn't have breakfast.

1336
00:59:03.088 --> 00:59:04.727
Yeah. you did.

1337
00:59:04.727 --> 00:59:06.421
I disagree. -I gave you
a brekky wrap this morning.

1338
00:59:06.421 --> 00:59:08.258
Technically.
this is all meal penalty.

1339
00:59:08.258 --> 00:59:10.194
- if you want the... -GAIL: Oh.
- It's fine. Just-just sign.

1340
00:59:10.194 --> 00:59:11.866
Thanks. -I'm just saying.
not everyone's gonna be as cool

1341
00:59:11.866 --> 00:59:13.461
- about it as I am. You know?
- No. I get it.

1342
00:59:13.461 --> 00:59:15.232
What is this?

1343
00:59:15.232 --> 00:59:19.467
I've got you on a 5:55 flight
out of here. Okay?

1344
00:59:19.467 --> 00:59:20.974
- I have a car waiting for you.
- Now?

1345
00:59:20.974 --> 00:59:23.779
Engine's on. Yeah. Colt...

1346
00:59:23.779 --> 00:59:26.540
there is some serious shit
going down. okay?

1347
00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:29.312
I just told Jody I was gonna
meet her for karaoke.

1348
00:59:29.312 --> 00:59:31.083
And I'm actually embarrassed
that I got you here

1349
00:59:31.083 --> 00:59:33.085
- and got you all tangled up.

1350
00:59:33.085 --> 00:59:35.120
I just want to get you out
of here before it escalates.

1351
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.627
Get your stuff together.
We're going.

1352
00:59:36.627 --> 00:59:38.552
You're gonna miss the flight.
Thank you.

1353
00:59:38.552 --> 00:59:40.059
- Sorry.
-Okay. but I'm late.

1354
00:59:40.059 --> 00:59:41.665
and I got to get Ryder's dogs
to daycare.

1355
00:59:41.665 --> 00:59:43.590
Fluffy needs her oatmeal bath.
She gets hives.

1356
00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:45.900
Hey. should I be

I didn't think you liked
coming to these things.

1398
01:01:35.603 --> 01:01:37.946

01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:10.814
What am I supposed to do
about it?

1419
01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:12.442
You're a stunt guy
who used to date the director

1420
01:02:12.442 --> 01:02:14.444
and seems to be getting close
to rekindling

1421
01:02:14.444 --> 01:02:17.381

legendary torrid love affair.

1422
01:02:17.381 --> 01:02:18.822
Do you think
we're close to rekindling?

01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:19.955
I mean. it feels like it
to me...

1424
01:02:19.955 --> 01:02:22.287
Is it a deal or not?

1425
01:02:22.287 --> 01:02:24.927
It can help you find Ryder.

1426
01:02:24.927 --> 01:02:26.225
- I'll do what I can.

1427
01:02:26.225 --> 01:02:27.655

1430
01:02:30.658 --> 01:02:32.132
I'm gonna need you
to sign an NDA.

1431
01:02:32.132 --> 01:02:33.628
As you know.

1432
01:02:33.628 --> 01:02:35.300

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:07.937
- Colt.
- No. he didn't.

1439
01:03:07.937 --> 01:03:10.038

by to sing some karaoke.

talk to me about it?

01:03:49.871 --> 01:03:51.277
Give me that.

1447
01:03:52.951 --> 01:03:54.313
- Fine.

1449
01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:56.810

- All I know is

1557
01:10:15.122 --> 01:10:16.893
some really bad guys
are trying to get it.

1558
01:10:16.893 --> 01:10:18.532
Are you serious? What?

1559
01:10:18.532 --> 01:10:20.567
I just got to figure out
what's on there.

1560
01:10:21.768 --> 01:10:23.933
Then find Ryder and get him
to finish Jody's movie.

1561
01:10:23.933 --> 01:10:26.067
Okay. Well. shit. yeah.

1562
01:10:26.067 --> 01:10:27.805
Venti. she's like a tech genius
at this stuff.

1563
01:10:27.805 --> 01:10:29.543
- Thank you!

1564
01:10:29.543 --> 01:10:30.742
Hey. Venti!

1565
01:10:30.742 --> 01:10:32.546
- Ventilicious.
- Hey.

1566
01:10:32.546 --> 01:10:34.449
What's poppin' on. boys?

1567
01:10:34.449 --> 01:10:37.749
- Yeah. Ventinator.

1568
01:10:37.749 --> 01:10:39.850
You know how
to get into this thing?

1569
01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:43.623
Oh. I've seen
some of these guys.

1570
01:10:43.623 --> 01:10:45.724
This thing is a vault.

1571
01:10:45.724 --> 01:10:47.627
It'll take me like two or
three days to crack this thing.

1572
01:10:47.627 --> 01:10:49.431
Yeah. but you're like
a tech genius. you know?

1573
01:10:49.431 --> 01:10:51.125
What if you don't have
three days?

1574
01:10:51.125 --> 01:10:52.500
You need the password.
I'm telling you that.

1575
01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.667
- You're next.

1576
01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:56.372
Nigel. Nigel!

1577
01:10:58.101 --> 01:11:00.508
Knowing Ryder. it's...

1578
01:11:00.508 --> 01:11:03.005
written on a Post-it note
in his apartment somewhere.

1579
01:11:03.005 --> 01:11:04.842
Okay.

1580
01:11:04.842 --> 01:11:07.108
Okay. next up. we've got Dan.

1581
01:11:07.108 --> 01:11:09.077
Come on. buddy. Come on. Dan.

1582
01:11:09.077 --> 01:11:10.650
Don't be shy. mate.

1583
01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:12.751
Come on. buddy. Let's go.

1584
01:11:12.751 --> 01:11:14.049
You owe me!

1585
01:11:19.122 --> 01:11:21.122
It's got
to be around here somewhere.

1586
01:11:21.122 --> 01:11:22.893
Mm-hmm. -Let's just split up.
Jean-Claude...

1587
01:11:41.144 --> 01:11:42.748
Hello.

1588
01:11:53.497 --> 01:11:54.925
Oh.

1589
01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:59.226
You know what? I deserve this.

1590
01:12:01.604 --> 01:12:02.867
Idiot.

1591
01:12:05.366 --> 01:12:06.871
Colt?

1592
01:12:06.871 --> 01:12:09.511
Colt! I got it! Colt!

1593
01:12:09.511 --> 01:12:10.842
To finishing the movie.

1594
01:12:10.842 --> 01:12:12.547
I think I got it.

1595
01:12:13.715 --> 01:12:15.143
All right.

1596
01:12:15.143 --> 01:12:16.980
That guy mentioned a video.

1597
01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:19.818
Oh. baby. I'm here at work.

1598
01:12:19.818 --> 01:12:22.249
but I got a little something
for you. a little surprise.

1599
01:12:22.249 --> 01:12:24.086
It's just above my ass. Eh?

1600
01:12:24.086 --> 01:12:25.989
Oh. my God. Cover your eyes.

1601
01:12:25.989 --> 01:12:28.255
I think I've seen Tom's ass
more than my own. -

1602
01:12:28.255 --> 01:12:29.531
Okay.

1603
01:12:29.531 --> 01:12:32.160
Now is the winter
of our discontent

1604
01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.668
Made glorious summer
by this sun of York...

1605
01:12:34.668 --> 01:12:35.999
He's such a dick.

1606
01:12:35.999 --> 01:12:37.902
But. God. he's good.

1607
01:12:37.902 --> 01:12:39.442
Yeah.

1608
01:12:40.401 --> 01:12:41.741
What about this?

1609
01:12:44.205 --> 01:12:46.746
Oh. here's that party his
assistant was talking about.

1610
01:12:47.815 --> 01:12:49.551
Iggy.

1611
01:12:49.551 --> 01:12:51.619
That's Henry.
That's Ryder's stunt double.

1612
01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.986
He looks a lot like the guy
I saw at the hotel.

1613
01:12:58.056 --> 01:13:01.255
When you were high?
And you were seeing unicorns?

1614
01:13:01.255 --> 01:13:03.631
And a dead guy on ice.

1615
01:13:08.735 --> 01:13:11.067
Hell yeah! Come on!

1616
01:13:11.067 --> 01:13:13.036
What?! What?!

1617
01:13:13.036 --> 01:13:15.071
Do I do my own stunts?

1618
01:13:15.071 --> 01:13:16.402
I think I do.

1619
01:13:16.402 --> 01:13:18.547
I think I freakin' do.

1620
01:13:18.547 --> 01:13:19.977
Yeah. baby.

1621
01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.460
Uh. gimme. gimme.
gimme. gimme...

1622
01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:31.527
Gimme the phone.
Gimme the phone.

1623
01:13:34.697 --> 01:13:36.961
- Oh. shit.
- Did they just kill Henry?

1624
01:13:46.676 --> 01:13:48.940
They just killed Henry.

1625
01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.942
- Oh. it's Venti.

1626
01:13:51.978 --> 01:13:53.406
- Hey. uh... Hello?
-Dan.

1627
01:13:53.406 --> 01:13:55.518
Turn on the news right now.

1628
01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:58.917
I can't believe this!

1629
01:13:58.917 --> 01:14:01.821
The dead body discovered this
morning at the Pendleton Hotel

1630
01:14:01.821 --> 01:14:04.450
has been identified
as Henry Herrera.

1631
01:14:04.450 --> 01:14:07.761
an American stuntman known for
doubling superstar Tom Ryder.

1632
01:14:07.761 --> 01:14:10.665
Authorities are investigating
his death as a murder.

1633
01:14:10.665 --> 01:14:12.766
Their prime suspect
is another stuntman.

1634
01:14:12.766 --> 01:14:14.999
Colt Seavers. who was
last seen in the hotel room

1635
01:14:14.999 --> 01:14:17.837
where Herrera's body
was discovered.

1636
01:14:17.837 --> 01:14:20.543
Police have released
this security footage

1637
01:14:20.543 --> 01:14:23.370
showing Seavers leaving
the scene of the crime.

1638
01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:25.845
If you have any information.
please do us a favor.

1639
01:14:25.845 --> 01:14:28.716
reach out to Crime Stoppers
by the number on your screen.

1640
01:14:28.716 --> 01:14:31.488
And we'll have more on that
later. In the meantime...

1641
01:14:35.318 --> 01:14:37.120
I got to call Jody.

1642
01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.320
RYDER
It's high noon

1643
01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.828
at the edge of
the universe. folks.

1644
01:14:42.994 --> 01:14:44.160
Which one was that?

1645
01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.535
That was take four.

1646
01:14:45.535 --> 01:14:47.064
RYDER
Goddamn it. Jody.

1647
01:14:47.064 --> 01:14:48.736
I mean. it looks like
frickin' Burning Man.

1648
01:14:48.736 --> 01:14:51.541
My balls are drenched.
I need a towel.

1649
01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:57.338
This dude always forgets
that he's mic'd.

1650
01:14:57.338 --> 01:14:59.406
- I know.
- He says the craziest shit.

1651
01:14:59.406 --> 01:15:01.716
Craziest shit. I know. I know.

1652
01:15:01.716 --> 01:15:03.751
What. is it on airplane mode?

1653
01:15:03.751 --> 01:15:05.852
If this was <i>The Fugitive</i>

1654
01:15:05.852 --> 01:15:09.350
and you were Harrison Ford...

1655
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:11.924
the bad guys would be
closing in.

1656
01:15:13.827 --> 01:15:15.158
I call tomahawk.

1657
01:15:15.158 --> 01:15:16.698
- Damn it.
- You stay alive.

1658
01:15:16.698 --> 01:15:18.194
Stay alive.

1659
01:15:18.194 --> 01:15:20.064
No matter how long it takes.

1660
01:15:20.064 --> 01:15:22.704
No matter how far. I will

1661
01:15:22.704 --> 01:15:25.036
find you!

1662
01:15:25.036 --> 01:15:27.170
<i>- Last of the Mohicans.</i>
- Ah.

1663
01:15:27.170 --> 01:15:28.743

1664
01:15:28.743 --> 01:15:31.438
Damn it.

1665
01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:45.485
Shit. is this rubber? Oh. God.

1666
01:16:00.434 --> 01:16:02.645
- Daniel Day-Lewis!

1667
01:16:17.759 --> 01:16:19.728
Jason Bourne!

1668
01:16:35.337 --> 01:16:37.009
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson!

1669
01:16:38.342 --> 01:16:40.375
- Give me the phone!

1670
01:16:45.613 --> 01:16:47.118
Where's the phone. stuntman?

1671
01:16:47.118 --> 01:16:48.988
We got to get this phone
to the cops.

1672
01:16:48.988 --> 01:16:50.693
-Okay.
-It's the only thing--

1673
01:17:18.481 --> 01:17:19.854
Hey. man bun!

1674
01:17:19.854 --> 01:17:21.955
Where's the phone. stuntman?

1675
01:17:21.955 --> 01:17:25.321

Be careful of that. big fella.

1678
01:17:38.367 --> 01:17:40.006
Shut up!

1679
01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.976
I'm gonna go out the front
and make sure no one's there.

1680
01:17:42.976 --> 01:17:44.241
- Okay.

1681
01:17:44.241 --> 01:17:45.308

Colt's down.

1686
01:18:07.165 --> 01:18:10.333
Big fella got away. though.

1687

Uh-huh.

You can make it. You can

No! It's too dangerous!

Yeah.

1696
01:19:02.156 --> 01:19:04.761
Ooh. Gail. So tense.

1697
01:19:05.929 --> 01:19:07.962
You remember old Dressy. right?

1698
01:19:10.096 --> 01:19:11.460
Stuntman.

1699
01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.935
I never forget a fist.

1700
01:19:15.169 --> 01:19:17.499
Listen. I'm gonna need
the phone. Where is it?

1701
01:19:17.499 --> 01:19:19.776
It's a matter of urgency.
I need to know.

1702
01:19:21.505 --> 01:19:24.913
Right. The one that proves
that you killed Henry. not me.

1703
01:19:24.913 --> 01:19:26.178
- Eh...
- That phone.

1704
01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:27.410
- Well...
- Yeah.

1705
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:29.247
I'm gonna hold on to that.

1706
01:19:29.247 --> 01:19:31.282
Seems like it's the only thing
keeping me alive right now.

1707
01:19:31.282 --> 01:19:33.317
What?

1708
01:19:33.317 --> 01:19:35.990
He's the prime suspect. Jody.

1709
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:39.026
Gail. come on.
Are you kidding me?

1710
01:19:39.026 --> 01:19:40.423
- I know.
- Colt?

1711
01:19:40.423 --> 01:19:41.655
- Yeah.
- There's no way.

1712
01:19:41.655 --> 01:19:42.689
- That's what I said.
- There's no way!

1713
01:19:42.689 --> 01:19:44.097
What went wrong?

1714
01:19:44.097 --> 01:19:46.033
- What went wrong?
- Mmm.

1715
01:19:46.033 --> 01:19:48.035
What went wrong?
Well. as I look at it.

1716
01:19:48.035 --> 01:19:49.872
you know. you're--
you're torturing me

1717
01:19:49.872 --> 01:19:51.940
right outside your superyacht
like a Bond villain.

1718
01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:52.974
Dipshit!

1719
01:19:52.974 --> 01:19:54.734
What went wrong?

1720
01:19:55.704 --> 01:19:57.847
What went right?!

1721
01:19:59.015 --> 01:20:02.610
You changed.

1722
01:20:02.610 --> 01:20:05.283
You changed.

1723
01:20:05.283 --> 01:20:09.958
Yeah. We used to be
like brothers. you and I.

1724
01:20:09.958 --> 01:20:13.126
Entered into the sacred bond
of actor and stuntman. man.

1725
01:20:13.126 --> 01:20:14.897
- Oh. God.
- Yeah.

1726
01:20:14.897 --> 01:20:16.624
You think Colt could murder
a human being?

1727
01:20:16.624 --> 01:20:18.230
-No. I don't.
- Did you tell them that?

1728
01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.561
- I said that.
- This is a man--

1729
01:20:19.561 --> 01:20:21.035
This is a man
who spent 23 minutes

1730
01:20:21.035 --> 01:20:22.663
ushering a cockroach
out of my room once.

1731
01:20:22.663 --> 01:20:24.038
and I was like. "Just stomp
on it." and he was like.

1732
01:20:24.038 --> 01:20:25.831
"No. let it live."
I mean. it's Colt.

1733
01:20:25.831 --> 01:20:27.470
I told them all of that.

1734
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:30.143
I told him who he is--
who I thought he was.

1735
01:20:30.143 --> 01:20:31.507
Did you. emphatically?

1736
01:20:31.507 --> 01:20:33.047
- Yes. I did.
- Yeah. because he

1737
01:20:33.047 --> 01:20:35.016
was at the airport
where you sent him.

1738
01:20:35.016 --> 01:20:36.842
He never got on the plane. Jody.

1739
01:20:36.842 --> 01:20:38.415
- How many movies have we done?
- Oh. I don't know.

1740
01:20:38.415 --> 01:20:40.153
How many? Yeah. too many
to count. that's right.

1741
01:20:40.153 --> 01:20:42.188
Yeah. -'Cause I put you
in the contract. didn't I?

1742
01:20:42.188 --> 01:20:43.684
I put you there. right there.

1743
01:20:43.684 --> 01:20:45.356
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah? That's right.

1744
01:20:45.356 --> 01:20:46.720
I had the assistant.
the makeup and hair... -Right.

1745
01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.326
...uh. trainer. and then boom.

1746
01:20:48.326 --> 01:20:50.559
Ryder's number one stuntman.
Colt Seavers.

1747
01:20:50.559 --> 01:20:52.825
That was me. I did that.
I did that for you.

1748
01:20:52.825 --> 01:20:55.267
What are you gonna
do for me? Huh?

1749
01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:57.599
Die. I guess?

1750
01:20:57.599 --> 01:20:59.205
Right? Die?

1751
01:20:59.205 --> 01:21:00.734
- Is that the plan?
-It's nothing personal.

1752
01:21:00.734 --> 01:21:02.241
Oh. my God.
Well. I'm taking it personal.

1753
01:21:02.241 --> 01:21:03.605
- Yeah. I can see that.
- The torture.

1754
01:21:03.605 --> 01:21:05.343
You know what?
It's just business.

1755
01:21:05.343 --> 01:21:06.740
- The drugging. the Taser.
- You know. it's just business.

1756
01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:08.280
I mean. Tom Ryder's
a global brand.

1757
01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.051
- I'm taking it personal.
- I literally move markets.

1758
01:21:10.051 --> 01:21:13.186
If I go down...
the freakin' Dow goes down.

1759
01:21:13.186 --> 01:21:17.289
If you break your back.
I replace you like this. Boom.

1760
01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:19.258
You know. if you'd just
stuck to your job

1761
01:21:19.258 --> 01:21:21.392
instead of trying to
hog the spotlight.

1762
01:21:21.392 --> 01:21:23.229
this wouldn't have happened.
I mean. Henry wouldn't be

1763
01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:25.363
on the scene. his accident
wouldn't have happened.

1764
01:21:25.363 --> 01:21:27.937
your accident...
freaky little fall.

1765
01:21:27.937 --> 01:21:29.730
'Cause you just
push my buttons. man.

1766
01:21:29.730 --> 01:21:30.896
Wait a second. What?

1767
01:21:32.436 --> 01:21:34.867
What?

1768
01:21:34.867 --> 01:21:37.210
What did you say
about my accident?

1769
01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:39.080
Well. you know.
you pushed me over the edge.

1770
01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.082
You literally pushed a button.
I mean. you didn't--

1771
01:21:41.082 --> 01:21:43.579
<i>I mean. I pushed the button.</i>

1772
01:21:46.991 --> 01:21:49.750
<i>I had to crank it up a notch.</i>

1773
01:21:56.528 --> 01:21:57.967
That was you?

1774
01:21:57.967 --> 01:21:59.595
Yeah.

1775
01:22:03.007 --> 01:22:05.238
Had to teach you
a little lesson. didn't I?

1776
01:22:05.238 --> 01:22:07.240
Got a little
too big for your boots.

1777
01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.736
didn't you?

1778
01:22:08.736 --> 01:22:10.177
Henry's no different. you know.

1779
01:22:11.574 --> 01:22:14.742
Hey. You do your own stunts?

1780
01:22:14.742 --> 01:22:16.348
Do I do my own stunts?

1781
01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:18.988
In front of all those people.
that's humiliating.

1782
01:22:18.988 --> 01:22:21.056
And yeah. I'm gonna
kick you into next week.

1783
01:22:23.324 --> 01:22:26.259
But then Gail. you know...

1784
01:22:26.259 --> 01:22:28.657
- Remember Gail. right?
- I've known her for 15 years.

1785
01:22:28.657 --> 01:22:30.362
Oh. yeah. I forget. 'cause
you've been out of the game

1786
01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:31.957
- so long. you know?
- I introduced the two of you.

1787
01:22:31.957 --> 01:22:33.464
Calls me up and says.
"It doesn't look good."

1788
01:22:33.464 --> 01:22:36.038
Bad for marketing and renting.

1789
01:22:36.038 --> 01:22:38.271
and blah. blah. blah.
and murder and...

1790
01:22:38.271 --> 01:22:40.438
I know. I-I-I d--

1791
01:22:40.438 --> 01:22:44.211
I real-- I really
don't need this right now.

1792
01:22:44.211 --> 01:22:46.180
Fucking Henry!

1793
01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:48.281
Don't worry about it.

1794
01:22:48.281 --> 01:22:50.514
You lay low...

1795
01:22:50.514 --> 01:22:52.153
and I will handle everything.

1796
01:22:53.519 --> 01:22:56.619
Maybe we don't know people
as well as we think we do.

1797
01:22:56.619 --> 01:22:59.061
- Oh. my God.
- You know?

1798
01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:01.129
Oh. my God. it's Colt.

1799
01:23:01.129 --> 01:23:02.559
- Give me the phone.
- No.

1800
01:23:02.559 --> 01:23:04.231
- What are you doing?
- Gail. get off the pho--

1801
01:23:04.231 --> 01:23:05.694
- Oh! What are you doing?
- Oh. my-- Jesus Christ. Gail!

1802
01:23:05.694 --> 01:23:08.169
- Oh. my-- Oh. I'm so sorry.
- Oh. my God.

1803
01:23:08.169 --> 01:23:09.632
- Let me help you.
- No. stop it.

1804
01:23:09.632 --> 01:23:10.864
- Let me take it up to--
- Do you know what?

1805
01:23:10.864 --> 01:23:11.997
- Just give me a minute.
- Yep.

1806
01:23:11.997 --> 01:23:13.141
Just give me a minute.

1807
01:23:13.141 --> 01:23:15.374
- Yep.
- Come on.

1808
01:23:16.344 --> 01:23:18.575
This plan was so simple.

1809
01:23:18.575 --> 01:23:21.006
Yeah. we were gonna put
Henry's body on ice

1810
01:23:21.006 --> 01:23:22.744
so it doesn't decompose.

1811
01:23:22.744 --> 01:23:25.417
We could pull you out from
that rock you crawled under.

1812
01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:27.452
- My life. yep.
- You know. scan your face.

1813
01:23:29.291 --> 01:23:31.390
Dressy here is gonna stick you
on the murder video.

1814
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:33.095
Drug you. drive you
and Henry's body

1815
01:23:33.095 --> 01:23:36.021
off the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
in your car-- boom.

1816
01:23:36.021 --> 01:23:38.364
You got murder. suicide.

1817
01:23:38.364 --> 01:23:39.827
Cut. Check the gate.

1818
01:23:39.827 --> 01:23:41.499
Move on. Beautiful.

1819
01:23:41.499 --> 01:23:43.435
I think we have different ideas
of what simple is.

1820
01:23:43.435 --> 01:23:45.030
Y-You just didn't
stay down. did you?

1821
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:46.900
You had to. like. uh.
create a big scene.

1822
01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:48.605
like Colt Seavers does.

1823
01:23:48.605 --> 01:23:50.838
You could-- But you know what?
This can still work

1824
01:23:50.838 --> 01:23:54.512
because we got the murder.
now we just need the suicide.

1825
01:23:57.515 --> 01:23:59.451
- Sad.
- It's plot heavy.

1826
01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:01.453
We're getting tangled
in exposition.

1827
01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:03.257
Lose the last part--
the suicide.

1828
01:24:03.257 --> 01:24:05.226
You lose the audience
if there's too much.

1829
01:24:05.226 --> 01:24:06.623
Colt.

1830
01:24:06.623 --> 01:24:07.855
Where's the phone?

1831
01:24:07.855 --> 01:24:11.199
Tom. you need carbs!

1832
01:24:11.199 --> 01:24:14.433
Your brain runs on glucose!

1833
01:24:14.433 --> 01:24:17.205
For simple cognitive functions.

1834
01:24:17.205 --> 01:24:19.636
- You need them.
- Colt. you're the fall guy.

1835
01:24:19.636 --> 01:24:21.803
You're the fall guy. you know.

1836
01:24:21.803 --> 01:24:24.443
Where's the phone?

1837
01:24:24.443 --> 01:24:26.742
I mean. I-- You can keep
taking hits all night.

1838
01:24:26.742 --> 01:24:28.282
but you know what?

1839
01:24:28.282 --> 01:24:30.317
I can think of a few
other people who can't.

1840
01:24:30.317 --> 01:24:33.881
We could bring Dan up here.
maybe Jody. perhaps.

1841
01:24:33.881 --> 01:24:35.916
I mean. I like Jody.
but you know.

1842
01:24:35.916 --> 01:24:38.226
There's no phone.

1843
01:24:38.226 --> 01:24:39.788
Okay? That's the twist.

1844
01:24:39.788 --> 01:24:41.229
No phone.

1845
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:44.056
He shot it out of my hand.

1846
01:24:44.056 --> 01:24:45.629
Up there. go check.

1847
01:24:45.629 --> 01:24:48.170
You. too. all of you.
I'll wait.

1848
01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:50.799
-  He shot it.
- You didn't know you did that?

1849
01:24:50.799 --> 01:24:53.439
It's crazy. I've been wanting
to tell you this whole time.

1850
01:24:53.439 --> 01:24:54.770
No. he didn't.

1851
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:56.805
- I was by the door frame.
- No.

1852
01:24:56.805 --> 01:24:58.972
And he shoots it
out of my hands!

1853
01:24:58.972 --> 01:25:00.512
- No.
- Take the ties off.

1854
01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:02.415
- Oh. my God. what a relief.
- That's crazy.

1855
01:25:02.415 --> 01:25:04.615
You were right about one thing.
that was the only thing

1856
01:25:04.615 --> 01:25:07.915
keeping you alive.

1857
01:25:07.915 --> 01:25:09.653
I really wish you could see

1858
01:25:09.653 --> 01:25:11.083
what Jody's gonna do
with <i>Metalstorm.</i>

1859
01:25:11.083 --> 01:25:12.590
It's gonna be awesome.

1860
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:16.297
And honestly...
it's gonna be a banger.

1861
01:25:17.564 --> 01:25:19.531
Not so cocky now.
are you. mate?

1862
01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:21.962
Jesus. Mike Mike.
put a lid on it.

1863
01:25:26.408 --> 01:25:28.474
Wish you didn't
break that bond. bro.

1864
01:25:28.474 --> 01:25:30.036
Wish you didn't break that bond.

1865
01:25:30.036 --> 01:25:32.445
All right. stuntman.
time for a drink. mate. Eh?

1866
01:25:32.445 --> 01:25:35.481
- There we go. Eh?

1867
01:25:35.481 --> 01:25:37.142
Help!

1868
01:25:37.142 --> 01:25:38.979
- Help!

1869
01:25:38.979 --> 01:25:40.717
- Shut up. Shut up.
- Help!

1870
01:25:40.717 --> 01:25:42.719
Shut up. mate.

1871
01:25:51.235 --> 01:25:52.696
There.

1872
01:25:52.696 --> 01:25:54.236
This fire gag's real.

1873
01:26:08.945 --> 01:26:10.483
Come on. guys. start the boat.

1874
01:26:10.483 --> 01:26:11.849
He's gone the wrong way.

1875
01:26:24.301 --> 01:26:25.729
Shit!

1876
01:27:37.130 --> 01:27:38.967
Oh. Colt.

1877
01:27:38.967 --> 01:27:40.067
Colt?

1878
01:27:40.067 --> 01:27:41.442
- Hey.
- What's going on?

1879
01:27:41.442 --> 01:27:42.476
What'd you sing?

1880
01:27:42.476 --> 01:27:44.346
- What?
- At karaoke.

1881
01:27:44.346 --> 01:27:45.743
- I'm sorry I didn't make it.
- It doesn't matter.

1882
01:27:45.743 --> 01:27:47.316
Listen. Everyone's saying
you killed Henry.

1883
01:27:47.316 --> 01:27:48.977
- What's happening?
- Oh. that's not true.

1884
01:27:48.977 --> 01:27:50.517
You're gonna hear a lot
of things that aren't true.

1885
01:27:50.517 --> 01:27:53.322
I just wanted to say that
when I first got here.

1886
01:27:53.322 --> 01:27:55.423
when you asked how I was doing
and I gave you the thumbs-up.

1887
01:27:55.423 --> 01:27:56.985
when you were like.
"That's stunt guy bullshit."

1888
01:27:56.985 --> 01:27:59.251
and you're right.
it's total cliché.

1889
01:27:59.251 --> 01:28:01.022
but. you know.
there's a reason you don't see

1890
01:28:01.022 --> 01:28:02.793
the thumbs-down stunt guy.

1891
01:28:04.698 --> 01:28:07.435
You know. it's kind of part
of our training.

1892
01:28:07.435 --> 01:28:09.965
Right? You know.
you get hit by a car.

1893
01:28:09.965 --> 01:28:11.472
you get thrown out of a window.

1894
01:28:11.472 --> 01:28:13.375
you get set on fire.
you give the thumbs-up.

1895
01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:15.839
But. uh. after my accident--

1896
01:28:15.839 --> 01:28:19.843
turns out was not an accident.
by the way--

1897
01:28:19.843 --> 01:28:22.714
I. uh...

1898
01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:24.518
I wasn't okay.

1899
01:28:25.521 --> 01:28:27.884
And not because I broke my back.

1900
01:28:27.884 --> 01:28:31.492
because I just felt
like a huge...

1901
01:28:31.492 --> 01:28:33.257
failure.

1902
01:28:36.323 --> 01:28:38.323
And I realized that. uh...

1903
01:28:38.323 --> 01:28:40.831
you know. I'm not invincible.

1904
01:28:40.831 --> 01:28:42.536
Huge shocker.

1905
01:28:43.737 --> 01:28:46.540
And I thought maybe
I wasn't so special

1906
01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.333
or something. so I. uh...

1907
01:28:48.333 --> 01:28:50.907
just figured that
the thumbs-down version of me

1908
01:28:50.907 --> 01:28:53.745
wasn't what you got
into it for. so I disappeared.

1909
01:28:53.745 --> 01:28:56.242
But. you know. I didn't
just disappear on you.

1910
01:28:56.242 --> 01:28:59.553
Uh... just disappeared on.

1911
01:28:59.553 --> 01:29:04.052
on. uh. myself... too.

1912
01:29:05.792 --> 01:29:07.594
Anyway. I'm sorry.

1913
01:29:07.594 --> 01:29:09.596
You deserved more than that.
I'm sorry.

1914
01:29:09.596 --> 01:29:11.862
I just wanted you to be honest.

1915
01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:16.295
You know. honestly.
it. uh. all hurts.

1916
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:24.072
Getting hit by a car hurts.

1917
01:29:24.072 --> 01:29:26.074
Getting thrown out
of a window hurts.

1918
01:29:26.074 --> 01:29:30.210
Getting set on fire
really hurts.

1919
01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:33.422
But. uh...

1920
01:29:36.658 --> 01:29:38.988
...none of it ever hurt as much
as not being with you.

1921
01:29:41.564 --> 01:29:43.256
Where are you?

1922
01:29:44.732 --> 01:29:47.865
Is that from a movie
or did I just make that up?

1923
01:29:47.865 --> 01:29:49.570
It's pretty good.

1924
01:29:49.570 --> 01:29:51.066
-There he is!
- You can use it if you want.

1925
01:29:54.610 --> 01:29:56.137
No. please...

1926
01:29:56.137 --> 01:29:58.172
For what it's worth.
I'm still in love with you.

1927
01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.978
And I don't think you should
give up on that happy ending.

1928
01:30:01.978 --> 01:30:03.177
Colt.

1929
01:30:04.081 --> 01:30:05.784

I knew it.

1991
01:34:57.504 --> 01:34:58.604
- I knew it.

1992
01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.915
I knew you were alive.

1993
01:35:01.915 --> 01:35:03.048
Three shows a day.

1994
01:35:03.048 --> 01:35:04.115

01:35:07.417 --> 01:35:08.790
You remembered.

1997
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:11.584
Yes.
I'm happy you're alive. Colt.

1998
01:35:11.584 --> 01:35:13.520
Colt. I'm so happy you're alive.

1999
01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.060
- I knew it.
- Oh. my God.

2000
01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:16.897
- What were you doing...
- Nice work with the pen.

2001
01:35:16.897 --> 01:35:18.261
So sorry. -No. it was great.
You got it out just in time.

2002
01:35:18.261 --> 01:35:19.933
I think the ink poisoning
didn't set in.

2003
01:35:19.933 --> 01:35:22.397
-  Chef's kiss.
- What's going on?

2004
01:35:22.397 --> 01:35:24.267
Huh? -Everyone's saying
that you killed Henry.

2005
01:35:24.267 --> 01:35:26.434
Ryder killed Henry.
He framed me.

2006
01:35:26.434 --> 01:35:27.732
There's footage of you.

2007
01:35:27.732 --> 01:35:29.635
- Well. he deepfaked me.
- What?

2008
01:35:29.635 --> 01:35:31.703
They do it all the time
on the Internet.

2009
01:35:31.703 --> 01:35:34.310
They take Tom Cruise's face.
and they put it on yours.

2010
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:35.740
And you can't tell
the difference.

2011
01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:37.148
No. Okay. so where's
the real footage

2012
01:35:37.148 --> 01:35:39.117
of Ryder killing Henry?
How do we get it?

2013
01:35:39.117 --> 01:35:41.053
It was on Ryder's phone. and
then it got destroyed because

2014
01:35:41.053 --> 01:35:43.220
Dan's <i>Last of the Mohicans</i>
plan didn't work out. -What?

2015
01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:46.091
It's not his fault. you know?
He called tomahawk first. okay.

2016
01:35:46.091 --> 01:35:47.455
I got "blanks only."

2017
01:35:47.455 --> 01:35:48.720
And it was going
pretty well. actually.

2018
01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.557
and then Dressler showed up.

2019
01:35:50.557 --> 01:35:53.395
So he. you know. he does this.
like. Jason Bourne shit.

2020
01:35:53.395 --> 01:35:55.969
Okay. I have so many questions.

2021
01:35:55.969 --> 01:35:57.465
Okay.

2022
01:35:57.465 --> 01:35:59.467
Who else knows you're alive?

2023
01:35:59.467 --> 01:36:01.238
- No one.
- Great.

2024
01:36:01.238 --> 01:36:02.910
No. that's the point.
I mean. I figure

2025
01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:04.109
we can't finish the movie
unless they think I'm dead.

2026
01:36:04.109 --> 01:36:05.770
What movie?

2027
01:36:05.770 --> 01:36:06.815
<i>Metalstorm.</i>

2028
01:36:06.815 --> 01:36:08.575
What about <i>Metalstorm?</i>

2029
01:36:08.575 --> 01:36:09.983
If they think I'm dead.
they'll come back and finish.

2030
01:36:09.983 --> 01:36:11.149
- Who?
- Ryder.

2031
01:36:11.149 --> 01:36:12.854
- Finish what?
- The movie.

2032
01:36:12.854 --> 01:36:14.185
<i>- Metalstorm?</i>
- Exactly.

2033
01:36:14.185 --> 01:36:16.022
- Are you insane? You are insane.
- What?

2034
01:36:16.022 --> 01:36:17.485
You need to be
burning your fingerprints off.

2035
01:36:17.485 --> 01:36:18.651
and you need to be
getting across the border

2036
01:36:18.651 --> 01:36:20.356
as fast as possible.

2037
01:36:20.356 --> 01:36:22.688
We're gonna hide you
until we can clear your name.

2038
01:36:22.688 --> 01:36:24.624
None of it matters anymore.
It's just a stupid movie.

2039
01:36:24.624 --> 01:36:25.691
- What?
- It's a stupid movie.

2040
01:36:25.691 --> 01:36:27.165
Don't say that.

2041
01:36:27.165 --> 01:36:29.761
That's <i>Metalstorm</i>
you're talking about.

2042
01:36:29.761 --> 01:36:32.038
That's the movie you spent
your whole life trying to make.

2043
01:36:32.038 --> 01:36:33.699
Who knows?

2044
01:36:33.699 --> 01:36:35.701
You might inspire a whole
generation of little Jodys

2045
01:36:35.701 --> 01:36:39.012
to pick up cameras
and make their own movies.

2046
01:36:41.016 --> 01:36:43.016
You're just-- you're special.

2047
01:36:44.184 --> 01:36:46.382
And all of us get to be
a part of something special

2048
01:36:46.382 --> 01:36:48.648
because it comes from you.

2049
01:36:48.648 --> 01:36:52.025
I obviously failed
at getting us our happy ending.

2050
01:36:52.025 --> 01:36:53.785
but I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let

2051
01:36:53.785 --> 01:36:55.864
Space Cowboy and Aliena
not have theirs.

2052
01:37:02.167 --> 01:37:03.531
Jody. my love!

2053
01:37:03.531 --> 01:37:04.796
- One sec!
-  I'm coming...

2054
01:37:04.796 --> 01:37:06.204
-  Stop it.

2055
01:37:06.204 --> 01:37:07.733
Gail. She's in on it.

2056
01:37:07.733 --> 01:37:09.405
- What?
- Yes.

2057
01:37:09.405 --> 01:37:11.209
Okay. come on. -Let's just
kiss a little bit first.

2058
01:37:11.209 --> 01:37:13.013
No. come on. we g-- got to get
you in the bathroom. please.

2059
01:37:14.544 --> 01:37:15.774
Come on.

2060
01:37:17.382 --> 01:37:19.151
Come on.

2061
01:37:19.151 --> 01:37:21.648
- Christ!

2062
01:37:21.648 --> 01:37:22.990
Got to work.

2063
01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:24.926
You all right in there.
my darling?

2064
01:37:24.926 --> 01:37:27.390
Here. this-- Take this soap
and rub it on my belly.

2065
01:37:29.262 --> 01:37:30.899
Get in the bedroom.

2066
01:37:30.899 --> 01:37:33.396
- Okay. Colt. Are you good? Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

2067
01:37:33.396 --> 01:37:35.728
- Be quiet. Don't make a sound.
-Jod?

2068
01:37:35.728 --> 01:37:37.037
- My head. The head.
- What?

2069
01:37:39.534 --> 01:37:41.272
- Hi!
-Hey. Hello. you.

2070
01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:43.505
- Hey. Hey.
- Aw. come here.

2071
01:37:43.505 --> 01:37:44.913
Thank you.

2072
01:37:44.913 --> 01:37:46.343
Aw. how's my favorite director?

2073
01:37:46.343 --> 01:37:47.740
Uh. a bit emotional. you know.

2074
01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:49.247
Oh. no-- Jesus.

2075
01:37:49.247 --> 01:37:50.875
Like Johnny and Amber
have just been here.

2076
01:37:50.875 --> 01:37:52.844
I just need to vent.
'cause it's been...

2077
01:37:52.844 --> 01:37:55.517
- it's just been so much.
- I know. I know.

2078
01:37:55.517 --> 01:37:57.123
- I'm so sorry about Colt.
- Thank you.

2079
01:37:57.123 --> 01:37:59.587
You know. it's such a shame.
but what a mess.

2080
01:37:59.587 --> 01:38:00.962
- Right.
- Who knew?

2081
01:38:00.962 --> 01:38:02.854
- Yeah.
- I mean. I tried to help him.

2082
01:38:02.854 --> 01:38:05.296
I hope you know that. but
sometimes you can't help people

2083
01:38:05.296 --> 01:38:06.759
- who don't want to be saved.
- Right.

2084
01:38:06.759 --> 01:38:09.201
But silver lining

2085
01:38:09.201 --> 01:38:12.237
to this very dark
cloud.

2086
01:38:12.237 --> 01:38:14.074
I've got Ryder to come back.

2087
01:38:14.074 --> 01:38:15.702
- And I have a plan.
- Really?

2088
01:38:15.702 --> 01:38:17.704
But we're not
gonna be able to do

2089
01:38:17.704 --> 01:38:20.575
your big third act set piece.
the car jump.

2090
01:38:20.575 --> 01:38:23.710
It is an impossible jump.
especially now with Colt gone.

2091
01:38:23.710 --> 01:38:25.778
- Dead.
- He's gone.

2092
01:38:25.778 --> 01:38:27.989
- He's so dead.
- Stay with me.

2093
01:38:27.989 --> 01:38:29.485
I spoke to Venti.

2094
01:38:29.485 --> 01:38:31.421
She says that she can do it
in VFX.

2095
01:38:31.421 --> 01:38:32.818
The car jump.

2096
01:38:32.818 --> 01:38:35.095
All we need to focus on
is Ryder's new.

2097
01:38:35.095 --> 01:38:38.593
final. bombastic monologue.

2098
01:38:38.593 --> 01:38:39.968
I've read the pages.

2099
01:38:39.968 --> 01:38:41.464
God. you smashed it.
I knew you would.

2100
01:38:41.464 --> 01:38:43.004
- We're gonna get him covered.
- Yeah.

2101
01:38:43.004 --> 01:38:45.666
You. meanwhile...

2102
01:38:45.666 --> 01:38:48.273
please go and rest up in Fiji.
on me.

2103
01:38:48.273 --> 01:38:51.507
You know?
Plop yourself on a beach.

2104
01:38:51.507 --> 01:38:53.938
And I'm gonna take care
of all of it for you.

2105
01:38:53.938 --> 01:38:54.983
Gail.

2106
01:38:54.983 --> 01:38:56.512
You've got so much to process.

2107
01:38:56.512 --> 01:38:58.250
- No.
- I can take care of all of it.

2108
01:38:58.250 --> 01:39:00.780
No. This is my movie.

2109
01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:02.452
- Now. listen to me.

2110
01:39:02.452 --> 01:39:03.948
I've learned so much from you.

2111
01:39:03.948 --> 01:39:06.621
- I know. Thank you.
- And I'm very grateful.

2112
01:39:06.621 --> 01:39:08.755
But the lesson I stand by now.

2113
01:39:08.755 --> 01:39:10.328
- that you've taught me...
- Yeah. Yeah.

2114
01:39:10.328 --> 01:39:13.958
You fall down.
you get right back up.

2115
01:39:16.961 --> 01:39:18.963
I am directing this movie. yeah.

2116
01:39:18.963 --> 01:39:20.470
Oh. my God. that's my girl.

2117
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:22.373
It went in. I'm so proud
of you. -Good. Okay.

2118
01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:23.935
Thank you. All right.
let's get you out of here.

2119
01:39:23.935 --> 01:39:25.772
- One last thing.
- Yeah?

2120
01:39:25.772 --> 01:39:27.444
Have you seen Dan? -Nope.
I think he's by the taco truck.

2121
01:39:27.444 --> 01:39:28.874
- You haven't heard from him?
- He's probably-probably

2122
01:39:28.874 --> 01:39:30.150
over there somewhere.
Thank you so much.

2123
01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:31.712
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

2124
01:39:31.712 --> 01:39:33.186
Thanks for the pep talk.
Okay. buh-bye. -

2125
01:39:33.186 --> 01:39:34.286
- Love you. darling.
- Love you. too. Bye!

2126
01:39:34.286 --> 01:39:36.189
Oof.

2127
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:37.718
You're gonna finish the movie.

2128
01:39:37.718 --> 01:39:40.358
No. I'm gonna clear your name.
Okay. now listen.

2129
01:39:40.358 --> 01:39:41.557
Why can't we do both?

2130
01:39:41.557 --> 01:39:42.657
I think we can.

2131
01:39:42.657 --> 01:39:44.461
We're gonna bring him to set.

2132
01:39:44.461 --> 01:39:47.497
in a controlled environment.
and then we surround him...

2133
01:39:47.497 --> 01:39:49.961
And we beat the shit out of him.

2134
01:39:49.961 --> 01:39:51.468
No.

2135
01:39:51.468 --> 01:39:53.305
We're gonna force
a confession out of him

2136
01:39:53.305 --> 01:39:55.307
by putting him in a scene.

2137
01:39:55.307 --> 01:39:56.902
Right. -You know.
he always forgets he's mic'd.

2138
01:39:56.902 --> 01:39:58.376
That's better.

2139
01:39:58.376 --> 01:39:59.839
I just don't know
how to do it yet.

2140
01:40:03.581 --> 01:40:05.086
I know how to do that.

2141
01:40:07.288 --> 01:40:09.486
Make him do his own stunt.

2142
01:40:09.486 --> 01:40:11.092
The impossible jump.

2143
01:40:11.092 --> 01:40:13.523
Then we beat the shit
out of him.

2144
01:40:13.523 --> 01:40:16.798
One seventy-four.
alpha. take two.

2145
01:40:19.861 --> 01:40:21.168
JODY
And action!

2146
01:40:21.168 --> 01:40:23.269
O-One second. one second.
one second.

2147
01:40:26.032 --> 01:40:27.702
- Action!

2148
01:40:29.671 --> 01:40:31.002
It's high noon

2149
01:40:31.002 --> 01:40:32.905
at the edge of
the universe. folks.

2150
01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:51.891
Now. we're facing
a powerful enemy.

2151
01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:58.062
An alien species born of
the worst of humanity's traits.

2152
01:40:58.062 --> 01:41:01.373
Well. what our enemy doesn't see

2153
01:41:01.373 --> 01:41:04.904
is that their demise
is imminent.

2154
01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:10.846
And the most powerful weapon
in all galaxy?

2155
01:41:13.915 --> 01:41:15.849
Love.

2156
01:41:17.358 --> 01:41:23.956
Inside each and every
one of you is a spark. baby.

2157
01:41:23.956 --> 01:41:25.727
An ember.

2158
01:41:25.727 --> 01:41:28.092
A goddamn fire!

2159
01:41:31.966 --> 01:41:35.066
Love is how we will win.

2160
01:41:35.066 --> 01:41:37.475
And even if we lose.

2161
01:41:37.475 --> 01:41:41.281
we're gonna die
fighting for a happy ending!

2162
01:41:41.281 --> 01:41:44.515
- Hell yeah!

2163
01:41:44.515 --> 01:41:46.110
Whoo!

2164
01:41:46.110 --> 01:41:48.112
Well. let's go and get it. then!

2165
01:41:48.112 --> 01:41:51.082
Get on out there and go!

2166
01:41:51.082 --> 01:41:53.986
Who's with me?!
Who is with me?! Let's go!

2167
01:41:53.986 --> 01:41:55.955
Cut! Yes!

2168
01:41:55.955 --> 01:41:57.990
So good. so good.

2169
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:59.332
- Thank you.
-  Was that it?

2170
01:41:59.332 --> 01:42:00.465
- God. yeah.
- Did we get it?

2171
01:42:00.465 --> 01:42:02.126
- It was so good.
- We got it?

2172
01:42:02.126 --> 01:42:03.534
- Magic. Yeah. yeah.
-Yeah. it was hot. babe.

2173
01:42:03.534 --> 01:42:05.206
Oh. my God. Gail was in floods.

2174
01:42:05.206 --> 01:42:06.867
I really felt that one.
I really felt that one.

2175
01:42:06.867 --> 01:42:08.473
- She was-- Of course you did.
- 'Cause I had tears.

2176
01:42:08.473 --> 01:42:10.035
Of course you did.
Yeah. I know. I can see them.

2177
01:42:10.035 --> 01:42:11.773
-  -
- Yeah. it was fantastic.

2178
01:42:11.773 --> 01:42:14.006
So. listen. all we have left
is the alien truck coverage.

2179
01:42:14.006 --> 01:42:15.447
- All right? That's it.
- No.

2180
01:42:15.447 --> 01:42:17.141
Yep. We're gonna do
the car jump. -No.

2181
01:42:17.141 --> 01:42:18.879
No one told me about
another setup. -We said-- No.

2182
01:42:18.879 --> 01:42:20.650
- There's another setup?
- Venti's gonna do that in VFX.

2183
01:42:20.650 --> 01:42:22.487
so we're out of here. -I know.
but we need his close-up.

2184
01:42:22.487 --> 01:42:24.049
All right? I need his close-up
right here for the coverage.

2185
01:42:24.049 --> 01:42:25.193
All right? 15 minutes tops.
That's all I need.

2186
01:42:25.193 --> 01:42:26.788
This is the bit.
do you remember.

2187
01:42:26.788 --> 01:42:28.460
where Space Cowboy steals
the alien vehicle? -Hmm.

2188
01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:29.857
- Come on. This is his moment.
- Wait. wait. wait. wait.

2189
01:42:29.857 --> 01:42:31.199
I'm not gonna do
any driving. right?

2190
01:42:31.199 --> 01:42:32.794
Because I'm gonna feel
really nauseous.

2191
01:42:32.794 --> 01:42:34.059
It's a blue screen setup.

2192
01:42:34.059 --> 01:42:36.204
I need this. I need this. okay?

2193
01:42:37.196 --> 01:42:38.635
Zero notice here.

2194
01:42:38.635 --> 01:42:40.670
We're moving as fast
as we can. all right?

2195
01:42:40.670 --> 01:42:43.574
Everyone. double the pace. yes?!

2196
01:42:43.574 --> 01:42:45.873
Use those muscles!
Yes. good! Thank you!

2197
01:42:50.583 --> 01:42:53.177
Everyone in position!

2198
01:42:53.177 --> 01:42:55.047
Light the pyro!

2199
01:42:56.292 --> 01:43:00.657
We need enough charges to blow
this canyon sky-high. people.

2200
01:43:00.657 --> 01:43:02.362
NIGEL
McCabe. where are we?

2201
01:43:02.362 --> 01:43:03.693
Going as fast as I can. Nige.

2202
01:43:03.693 --> 01:43:05.024
We're as ready as we can be.

2203
01:43:05.024 --> 01:43:06.564
Okay. Hey. get Ray to come in

2204
01:43:06.564 --> 01:43:08.500
and check the mic
before we go. okay? -Copy.

2205
01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:11.272
Sound. can you come down here
and check Ryder's mic. please?

2206
01:43:16.378 --> 01:43:17.938
All right. Tom. You ready?

2207
01:43:17.938 --> 01:43:19.610
- Yeah.
- Okay. Remember this bit?

2208
01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:20.842
You're gonna be in
the alien vehicle. -Mm-hmm.

2209
01:43:20.842 --> 01:43:21.909
- Okay? Okay.
- Yep.

2210
01:43:21.909 --> 01:43:23.251
And with nowhere to go.

2211
01:43:23.251 --> 01:43:24.582
you're gonna jump the car
over the ravine.

2212
01:43:24.582 --> 01:43:26.419
So I just need
a quick pop on you...

2213
01:43:26.419 --> 01:43:28.047
Space Cowboy
ain't scared of no ravine.

2214
01:43:28.047 --> 01:43:29.917
- Of course he's not.
- So I'm thinking maybe just

2215
01:43:29.917 --> 01:43:31.215
a couple of reaction shots
of me gritting my teeth. -Yeah.

2216
01:43:31.215 --> 01:43:32.084
Like. "Goddamn."
Something like that.

2217
01:43:32.084 --> 01:43:33.459
Yeah. yeah. yeah. Stoic.

2218
01:43:33.459 --> 01:43:34.790
- Yeah. yeah. I like it.
- All right?

2219
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:36.462
- What do you think?
- I like it. Okay.

2220
01:43:36.462 --> 01:43:37.562
I think it's gonna be great.
Yeah. I love the choice.

2221
01:43:37.562 --> 01:43:38.860
All right. let's pop these on.

2222
01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:40.466
- Okay. What's this?
- There you go.

2223
01:43:40.466 --> 01:43:41.863
No. this is because
you've escaped the aliens.

2224
01:43:41.863 --> 01:43:43.194
Is this necessary?
It's a bit much. no?

2225
01:43:43.194 --> 01:43:44.030
Yeah. It looks cool.
Raise the stakes.

2226
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:45.768
It's kind of cool.

2227
01:43:45.768 --> 01:43:47.374
- Yeah. It's cool. Okay.
- Raise the stakes.

2228
01:43:47.374 --> 01:43:48.573
- Let's do it.
- 'Cause you know. Space Cowboy.

2229
01:43:48.573 --> 01:43:50.377
Nobody can get at
the Space Cowboy.

2230
01:43:50.377 --> 01:43:52.071
- No way. Even when he's cuffed.
- Excuse me. Tom. sorry.

2231
01:43:52.071 --> 01:43:53.710
Jesus. Ray. I told you
to do it before I got on set.

2232
01:43:53.710 --> 01:43:55.415
- Appreciate you. Tom.

2233
01:43:55.415 --> 01:43:56.416
Thank you. Sound good.

2234
01:43:56.416 --> 01:43:57.648
- Okay.
- Okay. great.

2235
01:43:57.648 --> 01:43:59.111
- So...
- So...

2236
01:43:59.111 --> 01:44:00.420
You got this guy
coming on your left. -Yep.

2237
01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:01.982
- Hey. bro.
- All right. take him out.

2238
01:44:01.982 --> 01:44:02.983
Someone else is gonna
crash down on the bonnet.

2239
01:44:02.983 --> 01:44:04.655
You're gonna take him out.

2240
01:44:04.655 --> 01:44:06.393
No. no. no. See. what I'm
thinking is maybe I come down.

2241
01:44:06.393 --> 01:44:08.989
I take him out first.
and I'm like "pow. pow. pow."

2242
01:44:08.989 --> 01:44:11.057
- I slide over and go "pow."
- Yeah. Yeah.

2243
01:44:11.057 --> 01:44:12.894
And then maybe I say
a little line like.

2244
01:44:12.894 --> 01:44:15.996
"I was shooting aliens
way before I was paid to."

2245
01:44:15.996 --> 01:44:18.064
Fantastic.
All right. let's lock it up.

2246
01:44:18.064 --> 01:44:20.066
- Let's shoot. Nigel.
-Standing by. please.

2247
01:44:20.066 --> 01:44:21.166
All right.

2248
01:44:21.166 --> 01:44:22.574
Take one. Marker.

2249
01:44:22.574 --> 01:44:25.973
In three. two. one. action.

2250
01:44:27.271 --> 01:44:28.844
Not your lucky day. alien.

2251
01:44:28.844 --> 01:44:30.615
You got to go.

2252
01:44:31.684 --> 01:44:32.782
You can't outrun me.

2253
01:44:32.782 --> 01:44:35.323
I'm Space Cowboy!

2254
01:44:35.323 --> 01:44:36.456
Yahoo!

2255
01:44:36.456 --> 01:44:38.249
You are approaching the ravine.

2256
01:44:38.249 --> 01:44:39.459
There's nowhere else to go.

2257
01:44:39.459 --> 01:44:41.252
- Turn right. Go on.

2258
01:44:41.252 --> 01:44:42.594
You have no choice.

2259
01:44:42.594 --> 01:44:43.595
You're gonna
have to make the jump.

2260
01:44:43.595 --> 01:44:46.598
In three. two. one.

2261
01:44:46.598 --> 01:44:49.931
Yeehaw!

2262
01:44:49.931 --> 01:44:51.471
Whoa. whoa.
whoa. hey. hey. hey.

2263
01:44:51.471 --> 01:44:53.099
Who is that in the car with him?

2264
01:44:53.099 --> 01:44:55.772
We're-we're in the middle
of a take right now. asshole.

2265
01:44:55.772 --> 01:44:57.609
What are you doing? Ah!

2266
01:44:57.609 --> 01:44:59.677
He's just buckling you in.
Safety first. That's it. -Ow!

2267
01:44:59.677 --> 01:45:01.976
It's really tight.
Is this necessary?

2268
01:45:01.976 --> 01:45:04.011
Hey. we are filming right now.

2269
01:45:04.011 --> 01:45:06.178
Keep rolling. keep rolling.

2270
01:45:06.178 --> 01:45:07.619
Sell it. Tom. It looks amazing.
Take a deep breath.

2271
01:45:07.619 --> 01:45:09.819
It does not look--
Get out of the car.

2272
01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:12.217
Howdy.

2273
01:45:12.217 --> 01:45:14.186
- No. no. wait. Stop. No.

2274
01:45:15.156 --> 01:45:16.221
Wait. what's happening?

2275
01:45:16.221 --> 01:45:18.124
Yeehaw!

2276
01:45:18.124 --> 01:45:20.324
Oh. my God! Whoa!

2277
01:45:20.324 --> 01:45:22.568
Get to the cars!

2278
01:45:25.538 --> 01:45:27.232
Jody. what the hell
are you doing?!

2279
01:45:27.232 --> 01:45:28.233
I'm trying to get something
real out of him. Gail.

2280
01:45:28.233 --> 01:45:29.542
There's no cameras on him!

2281
01:45:31.777 --> 01:45:34.811
Hey. Dan? They're approaching
Ambush Alley right now.

2282
01:45:34.811 --> 01:45:36.076
We're ready.

2283
01:45:37.682 --> 01:45:40.586
Let me out right now!

2284
01:45:40.586 --> 01:45:43.655
What are you gonna do. huh?
You gonna kill me? Again?!

2285
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:50.794
- Can you untie me?
- No.

2286
01:45:57.264 --> 01:45:58.868
McCabe!

2287
01:45:58.868 --> 01:46:02.443
Smoke screen in three. two. one!

2288
01:46:02.443 --> 01:46:04.368
Whoa!

2289
01:46:04.368 --> 01:46:06.304
This does not seem safe. man!

2290
01:46:11.784 --> 01:46:14.521
Dan. where are they?
Do you have eyes on them?

2291
01:46:14.521 --> 01:46:16.820
I see 'em.
Everything's going to plan.

2292
01:46:19.561 --> 01:46:21.429
I'll block the road.

2293
01:46:21.429 --> 01:46:23.288
They shall not pass!

2294
01:46:23.288 --> 01:46:26.093
I see them.
They're entering Ambush Alley.

2295
01:46:30.737 --> 01:46:32.440
I can't see shit!

2296
01:46:34.235 --> 01:46:36.235
McCabe. one!

2297
01:46:37.172 --> 01:46:39.513
McCabe. two!

2298
01:46:42.978 --> 01:46:44.749
McCabe! Now!

2299
01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:56.431
I love my job.

2300
01:47:00.767 --> 01:47:04.571
Whoa. mama!

2301
01:47:04.571 --> 01:47:06.903
Oh. goddamn!

2302
01:47:06.903 --> 01:47:09.433
I can't think straight when
you drive like this. -

2303
01:47:09.433 --> 01:47:10.940
You're supposed to be dead.

2304
01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:14.009
You blew up
in-in a thousand pieces.

2305
01:47:14.009 --> 01:47:15.340
You went kaboom.

2306
01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:17.980
Why would I have blown up.
Tom Ryder?

2307
01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:20.279
Why are you saying my name
like that?

2308
01:47:20.279 --> 01:47:21.984
That is your name.
isn't it. Tom Ryder? -Yes. yes.

2309
01:47:21.984 --> 01:47:23.491
A blind man could see
that you're

2310
01:47:23.491 --> 01:47:25.020
- Tom Ryder.
- You're saying that like...

2311
01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:26.593
-  "Ryder. Tom Ryder."
- Okay. That's me.

2312
01:47:26.593 --> 01:47:27.858
You're saying it like
some obsessed fangirl.

2313
01:47:27.858 --> 01:47:29.354
That's me. Colt Seavers.
saying that.

2314
01:47:29.354 --> 01:47:30.927
Roll the cameras.
We're heading for the jump.

2315
01:47:30.927 --> 01:47:32.159
Tom Ryder's
doing his own stunts!

2316
01:47:32.159 --> 01:47:33.996
Everyone. roll. Arm car?

2317
01:47:33.996 --> 01:47:35.261
Check.

2318
01:47:35.261 --> 01:47:36.636
- Heli.
-Check.

2319
01:47:36.636 --> 01:47:38.165
I'm done taking the falls
for you.

2320
01:47:38.165 --> 01:47:39.804
You're gonna do your own stunts
from now on.

2321
01:47:39.804 --> 01:47:41.366
I don't want to do
my own stunts. Colt! -Relax.

2322
01:47:41.366 --> 01:47:43.434
It's just a 250-foot jump
that'll probably kill us.

2323
01:47:43.434 --> 01:47:45.975
It's never been done before.
It's for Comic-Con.

2324
01:47:45.975 --> 01:47:48.945
- It's Hall H. It's a big deal.
- What are you doing. man?

2325
01:47:48.945 --> 01:47:50.342
I thought it'd be fitting.

2326
01:47:50.342 --> 01:47:52.685
Me and you. Tom Ryder.
one last stunt.

2327
01:47:52.685 --> 01:47:54.885
You know.
like Thelma and Louise.

2328
01:47:54.885 --> 01:47:56.821
- Thelma and Louise?
- Yeah.

2329
01:47:56.821 --> 01:47:59.054
- They die at the end.
- Exactly!

2330
01:47:59.054 --> 01:48:00.957
Murder-suicide.

2331
01:48:00.957 --> 01:48:02.926
Can you just pull over
and let me out right now?

2332
01:48:04.226 --> 01:48:06.699
You're not getting
out of this car until you.

2333
01:48:06.699 --> 01:48:09.130
Tom Ryder. tell me.
Colt Seavers. the truth!

2334
01:48:09.130 --> 01:48:10.230
All right. all right.
all right. all right!

2335
01:48:10.230 --> 01:48:11.803
It was all Gail.

2336
01:48:11.803 --> 01:48:13.805
When I killed Henry.
she wanted to cover it up

2337
01:48:13.805 --> 01:48:15.334
because. to be honest.

2338
01:48:15.334 --> 01:48:17.842
Space Cowboy's one of
my best roles yet. Colt.

2339
01:48:17.842 --> 01:48:19.503
and I don't want
this movie to fail.

2340
01:48:19.503 --> 01:48:21.175
So you're saying that Gail Meyer

2341
01:48:21.175 --> 01:48:24.244
was responsible for framing me
for your murder of Henry?

2342
01:48:24.244 --> 01:48:26.147
Yes! Yes!

2343
01:48:26.147 --> 01:48:27.918
But what's your real name?

2344
01:48:27.918 --> 01:48:29.524
Tom Ryder.

2345
01:48:30.593 --> 01:48:32.021
Did you get that. Jody?

2346
01:48:32.021 --> 01:48:34.419
We got it! He confessed.

2347
01:48:34.419 --> 01:48:36.058
You wearing a wire?
Bro. you recording this?

2348
01:48:36.058 --> 01:48:37.763
This is entrapment.
You can't do that.

2349
01:48:37.763 --> 01:48:39.391
- What are you doing?
- No. it's not entrapment.

2350
01:48:39.391 --> 01:48:41.965
because you're wearing
the wire. dipshit!

2351
01:48:46.068 --> 01:48:47.399
He's going for it. Go. Go now.

2352
01:48:47.399 --> 01:48:48.906
I'm just an actor!

2353
01:48:48.906 --> 01:48:50.204
Wait.

2354
01:48:50.204 --> 01:48:52.041
He has a mouth guard.

2355
01:48:52.041 --> 01:48:54.615
I don't have a mouth guard.

2356
01:49:42.456 --> 01:49:44.423
- Oh. good.
-Colt!

2357
01:49:44.423 --> 01:49:46.898
- You're alive.
- Are you okay?

2358
01:49:48.262 --> 01:49:49.736
Are you okay?

2359
01:49:49.736 --> 01:49:51.463
I told you
I'd make the camera up to you.

2360
01:49:51.463 --> 01:49:53.267
Oh. it was fantastic.

2361
01:49:53.267 --> 01:49:54.939
GAIL
Dressler. come in! -Ah!

2362
01:49:54.939 --> 01:49:57.568
Oy. can you hear me?
We've got to get out of here!

2363
01:49:57.568 --> 01:49:58.910
RYDER
This is all Gail's fault. man.

2364
01:49:58.910 --> 01:50:00.505
This is all Gail's idea.

2365
01:50:00.505 --> 01:50:01.913
-Give me that confession!
-  No.

2366
01:50:01.913 --> 01:50:03.783
Give me all the media!
Are you deaf?!

2367
01:50:03.783 --> 01:50:06.753
Dressler. bring
the helicopter to the trench.

2368
01:50:06.753 --> 01:50:07.952
- What about Ryder?

Just come with me.

2378
01:50:28.335 --> 01:50:30.843
We don't need
all this toxic masculinity.

2379
01:50:30.843 --> 01:50:32.273

you and me.

2380

2381
01:50:34.110 --> 01:50:35.848
No. no. no. no.
I'm nothing like you.

2382
01:50:35.848 --> 01:50:38.312
I don't want to be
presumptuous. I mean.

2383
01:50:38.312 --> 01:50:41.018
but let's call a spade a spade.

2384
01:50:41.018 --> 01:50:42.855
That's why I gave you the job.

2385
01:50:42.855 --> 01:50:44.351
