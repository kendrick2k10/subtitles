It'll cost you $1.50
to get $20.

19

after the frickin' A.T.M.
takes its cut.

to my phone. P.D.A.

740

the codes?

No. I guess I never really

Exactly. Who's gonna monitor

Did you just say Duran Duran?

772

Yep.

Zeppelin are spooks
and Duran Duran

are '80s pretty boy
bad-ass crime syndicate?

780

That is just not right.

781
00:32:20.766 --> 00:32:22.285
No. it's absolutely true.

782
00:32:22.354 --> 00:32:26.703
If someone posts looking for
"a view to a kill."

783
00:32:26.772 --> 00:32:29.050
that means "assassin wanted."

784
00:32:29.119 --> 00:32:35.712
If someone posts "are you hungry
like the wolf?". that means
hired hands for a bank job.

787
00:32:39.888 --> 00:32:42.719
So you're saying Duran Duran
is at the center of an

788
00:32:42.788 --> 00:32:44.824
international crime syndicate.

789
00:32:44.893 --> 00:32:49.346
Well. I seriously doubt
Nick Rhodes or Simon Lebon
are actually involved.

But... It's not a bad place
to hide. now. is it?

00:32:57.527 --> 00:32:59.425

-This is weird.
-Not really.

I mean. forget
about porn sites and dot-coms.

796
00:33:05.949 --> 00:33:08.572

797
00:33:08.641 --> 00:33:10.436

is booming.

you have to steal it.

but why... Why Duran Duran?

Why?

801
00:33:18.858 --> 00:33:20.929
Why not?

802
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:24.519
Anyway. Simon gets the codes.

803
00:33:24.588 --> 00:33:25.624

810

813
00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:40.259
It's just a surcharge

00:43:18.837 --> 00:43:19.873
Thank you.

1081
00:43:19.942 --> 00:43:22.323
I truly appreciate your candor.

1082
00:43:22.392 --> 00:43:28.502
And a tactical analysis.
what would that currently be?

1083
00:43:28.571 --> 00:43:30.711
-Fucked.
-Great.

1084
00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:37.028
Okay. let me get back to you
with a backup plan that
should solve a few problems.

1085
00:43:37.097 --> 00:43:38.374
Really?

1086
00:43:38.443 --> 00:43:40.031
Oh. that'd be great...

1088
00:43:48.729 --> 00:43:50.386

-[Jinx] Hello?
-I want to make a deal.

1096
00:45:09.051 --> 00:45:11.156
A deal.

1097
00:45:11.225 --> 00:45:12.640
I do.

1098
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:15.229
...As I figure it.
50% of something

1099
00:45:15.298 --> 00:45:17.611
is a lot better than
100% of nothing.

1100
00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:19.613
-Yeah. and?
-And. frankly.

1101
00:45:19.682 --> 00:45:21.339
nothing is all I've got
right now.

1102
00:45:21.408 --> 00:45:23.755

What's it gonna take?

Hello?

1107
00:45:30.658 --> 00:45:35.111
-[Nick] I want to make a deal.
-Come again?

1108
00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:38.321
I think we may have
gotten off on the wrong foot.

1109
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:41.117
I'd like to start over
and introduce myself.

1110
00:45:41.186 --> 00:45:42.567
I'm Nick.

1111
00:45:42.636 --> 00:45:45.673
I'm calling to cut you in
on this thing.

1112
00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:47.641
Uh. okay.

1113
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:50.333
So. uh. a deal.

1114
00:45:50.402 --> 00:45:53.267
Okay. so. so what's the deal
with the. with the...

1115
00:45:53.336 --> 00:45:54.717
A deal. Nick?

1116
00:45:54.786 --> 00:45:56.167
It is Nick. isn't it?

1117
00:45:56.236 --> 00:45:58.548
You know. I apologize
for the pseudonym.

1118
00:45:58.617 --> 00:46:00.067
It's not that I don't trust you.

1119
00:46:00.136 --> 00:46:01.828
really. it's just sort of

1120
00:46:01.897 --> 00:46:04.071
an occupational hazard.

1121
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.970
Oh. yeah. no. I...

1122
00:46:06.039 --> 00:46:07.799
I understand. I get it.

1123
00:46:07.868 --> 00:46:10.940
It's not like my name's
really Jinx either.

1124
00:46:11.009 --> 00:46:12.977
It isn't?

1125
00:46:13.046 --> 00:46:14.841
No. it Is.
That is my name.

1126
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:17.429
Hey. that's okay.
Perfectly valid.

1127
00:46:17.498 --> 00:46:19.431
Anyway. what can I do
for you. Nick?

1128
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.607
Jinx. we have a bit
of a situation here.

1129
00:46:22.676 --> 00:46:25.541
a quagmire as it were.

1130
00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:30.132
and I think it's down to you
and me to figure this thing out.

1131
00:46:30.201 --> 00:46:33.169
You and me?
Okay.

1132
00:46:33.238 --> 00:46:35.551
I'm gonna put the cards
on the table.

1133
00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:36.690
You have something I need--

1134
00:46:36.759 --> 00:46:38.243
information-- information

1135
00:46:38.312 --> 00:46:40.418
my associates are no longer

1136
00:46:40.487 --> 00:46:42.558
in a position to offer.

1137
00:46:42.627 --> 00:46:45.112
I propose we adapt. evolve.

1138
00:46:45.181 --> 00:46:46.838
grow some balls. and walk

1139
00:46:46.907 --> 00:46:48.978
ourselves out of this quagmire.

1140
00:46:49.047 --> 00:46:51.222
I'll cut to the chase.
What do you want?

1141
00:46:51.291 --> 00:46:52.844
My 20 bucks.

1142
00:46:52.913 --> 00:46:54.432
I'm sorry...

1143
00:46:54.501 --> 00:46:57.435
Did you say 20 bucks?

1144
00:46:57.504 --> 00:46:58.505
Yup.

1145
00:46:58.574 --> 00:47:00.507
I don't want to be rude.

1146
00:47:00.576 --> 00:47:01.611
but I think you might want

1147
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.717
to revise that number.

1148
00:47:03.786 --> 00:47:05.615
You think?

1149
00:47:05.684 --> 00:47:07.859
Like... What?

1150
00:47:07.928 --> 00:47:10.517
Like. look around you.

1151
00:47:10.586 --> 00:47:12.588
I'd add a few zeroes to that

1152
00:47:12.657 --> 00:47:15.039
$20 figure of yours.

1153
00:47:15.108 --> 00:47:17.420
And I just walk out
with everything.

1154
00:47:17.489 --> 00:47:19.560
You don't want any piece
of this money?

1155
00:47:19.629 --> 00:47:23.150
All I need is for you
to walk over
to the computer terminal

1156
00:47:23.219 --> 00:47:25.739
and generate
a pin number for me.

1157
00:47:25.808 --> 00:47:27.051
Easy as pie.

1158
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.019
Same arrangement I had
with them.

1159
00:47:30.088 --> 00:47:34.610
If it ain't broke.
don't fix it. right?

1160
00:47:34.679 --> 00:47:38.269
If it ain't broke...

1161
00:47:38.717 --> 00:47:41.099
Right.

1162
00:47:41.168 --> 00:47:44.171
Yeah. so. I. I walk.

1163
00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:49.452
And you have no problem selling
out Simon and Jessica and...

1164
00:47:49.521 --> 00:47:52.593
Whoever else. just for
a little info?

1165
00:47:52.662 --> 00:47:55.562
This must be a pretty
valuable pin number.

1166
00:47:55.631 --> 00:47:56.977
Things change.

1167
00:47:57.046 --> 00:47:58.979
We adapt. right?

1168
00:47:59.048 --> 00:48:01.775
-Bullshit.
-What?

1169
00:48:01.844 --> 00:48:04.812
I said... "Bullshit."

1170
00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:09.265
You had no intention of
letting these guys out of here.
did you. Nick?

1171
00:48:09.334 --> 00:48:10.957
What are you talking about?

1172
00:48:11.026 --> 00:48:13.028
"If it ain't broke.
don't fix it." right?

1173
00:48:13.097 --> 00:48:16.479
In fact. that reminds me of
something a friend once said.

1174
00:48:16.548 --> 00:48:19.068
"breaking into a bank is what
screws you. because breaking

1175
00:48:19.137 --> 00:48:22.485
in takes time and time is
what gets you caught."

1176
00:48:22.554 --> 00:48:26.489
So how do you rob a bank
without breaking in?

1177
00:48:26.558 --> 00:48:29.285
Unlock everything at once.
fast and efficient?

1178
00:48:29.354 --> 00:48:32.150
Use this computer. a few codes.
then grab and go?

1179
00:48:32.219 --> 00:48:33.876
No. I don't think so.

1180
00:48:33.945 --> 00:48:36.361
If you knew enough to get these
codes and what to do with them.

1181
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:40.676
then you knew that this vault
door would seal up as soon
as the alarm was tripped.

1182
00:48:40.745 --> 00:48:42.505
Boom... You're trapped.

1183
00:48:42.574 --> 00:48:45.784
So while the codes seem like
a good idea. they're nothing

1184
00:48:45.853 --> 00:48:50.582
more than bait... Just means
to some other end for you.

1185
00:48:50.651 --> 00:48:54.241
In other words.
the codes are bullshit.

1186
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:57.520
It's really all about that
innocent little pin.

1187
00:48:57.589 --> 00:49:00.523
which I'm betting
is worth a hell of a lot
more than anything else

1188
00:49:00.592 --> 00:49:05.528
in here but the only way to get
that pin is in this vault.

1189
00:49:05.597 --> 00:49:08.600
I don't know.
just a working theory. Nick.

1190
00:49:08.669 --> 00:49:10.740
All righty there. Colombo.

1191
00:49:10.809 --> 00:49:14.537
You seem to be answering
a lot of unasked questions
for an innocent bystander.

1192
00:49:14.606 --> 00:49:16.608
What the hell are you
getting at?

1193
00:49:16.677 --> 00:49:20.992
Hey. it's not for nothing.
but I didn't ask to be locked

1194
00:49:21.061 --> 00:49:23.546
in this frickin' vault.

1195
00:49:23.615 --> 00:49:28.103
All I ever wanted was
my 20 bucks. but no.

1196
00:49:28.172 --> 00:49:30.933
Some greedy bastard decided it
was a great idea to increase

1197
00:49:31.002 --> 00:49:32.728
his bank's profit margin.

1198
00:49:32.797 --> 00:49:34.005
fire tellers to lower corporate

1199
00:49:34.074 --> 00:49:35.731
costs. close branches.

1200
00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.560
install endless A.T.M. Machines.

1201
00:49:37.629 --> 00:49:39.390
surcharging my ass
to kingdom come.

1202
00:49:39.459 --> 00:49:42.220
until I can't afford
my own 20 bucks.

1203
00:49:42.289 --> 00:49:44.740
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

1204
00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:46.293
[Jinx] I'm glad you asked.

1205
00:49:46.362 --> 00:49:48.054
"Insufficient funds" means
I had to walk my ass

1206
00:49:48.123 --> 00:49:50.953
into the only grant liberty I
could find to withdraw my money.

1207
00:49:51.022 --> 00:49:53.300
but it was already having
a large withdrawal made--

1208
00:49:53.369 --> 00:49:55.682
i.e.. being robbed--
which was perfectly fine

1209
00:49:55.751 --> 00:49:57.787
by me until some jackass
pointed a gun at me.

1210
00:49:57.856 --> 00:50:00.342
So this guy gets all jumpy.
tries to blow my head off.

1211
00:50:00.411 --> 00:50:02.861
His gun jams and I run for cover
in this vault. which proceeds

1212
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:05.657
to lock behind me. locking me in
this vault where I literally run

1213
00:50:05.726 --> 00:50:09.178
into some super hot chick who
I'm trapped with. which sounds

1214
00:50:09.247 --> 00:50:11.353
great except she proceeded
to punch me in the face.

1215
00:50:11.422 --> 00:50:13.941
ruining my otherwise wonderfully
boring day and wasting

1216
00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:15.978
my pedantically precious time.

1217
00:50:16.047 --> 00:50:17.773
[Thump]

1218
00:50:17.842 --> 00:50:19.499
Bummer.

1219
00:50:19.568 --> 00:50:20.638
So screw it.

1220
00:50:20.707 --> 00:50:22.950
Screw service fees
and screw you.

1221
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.229
You and all the corporate
convenience criminals

1222
00:50:25.298 --> 00:50:27.369
are equally fucked
in your high-tech heists.

1223
00:50:27.438 --> 00:50:32.098
You cannot keep screwing guys
like me and then add
a surcharge for it.

1224
00:50:32.167 --> 00:50:36.343
I am taking charge
of the surcharge.

1225
00:50:36.412 --> 00:50:39.346
In short. blow me.
I want answers.

1226
00:50:39.415 --> 00:50:42.108
Wow. you are having
a bad day.

1227
00:50:42.177 --> 00:50:43.833
Please. go on.

1228
00:50:43.902 --> 00:50:45.801
The real question is. how do

1229
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:47.147
you get in this vault

1230
00:50:47.216 --> 00:50:48.942
without getting trapped
in this vault?

1231
00:50:49.011 --> 00:50:50.668
-My guess?
You don't do it at all.

1232
00:50:50.737 --> 00:50:52.670
You don't care if your
anonymously hired guns

1233
00:50:52.739 --> 00:50:54.948
get trapped as long
as they're in the vault.

1234
00:50:55.017 --> 00:50:57.813
because as long as you
had someone in the vault.

1235
00:50:57.882 --> 00:50:59.228
you had what you wanted...

1236
00:50:59.297 --> 00:51:01.265
-Almost.
-I'm hanging up.

1237
00:51:01.334 --> 00:51:03.405
No. no. you know...
Fuck you. you're not hanging up!

1238
00:51:03.474 --> 00:51:06.063
You know why?
Because you don't have your
four precious little numbers.

1239
00:51:06.132 --> 00:51:07.167
What the... ?

1240
00:51:07.236 --> 00:51:08.513
Jessica.
Name's Jessica.

1241
00:51:08.582 --> 00:51:10.274
I'm one of the ones you
set up to screw.

1242
00:51:10.343 --> 00:51:12.379
Yeah. it almost hurts.
doesn't it?

1243
00:51:12.448 --> 00:51:14.381
-What?
-I'm glad you asked.

1244
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:17.557
-It's called "exploding noema."
-Huh?

1245
00:51:17.626 --> 00:51:19.455
It's the theory about
the moment you can't reconcile

1246
00:51:19.524 --> 00:51:21.457
the difference between your
perception of what should be

1247
00:51:21.526 --> 00:51:23.252
versus the reality of what is.

talking me through this crisis.

It's. it's been very stressful
for me. you know?

anything. really.

we reach an agreement.

00:58:18.736 --> 00:58:20.220
[Jinx] I believe we're good.

1422
00:58:20.289 --> 00:58:22.395
Enter that number
in the "personal identification

1423
00:58:22.464 --> 00:58:24.259
number" sub menu.

1424
00:58:24.328 --> 00:58:25.571
In that page. you'll see

1425
00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.434
four digits corresponding

1426
00:58:27.504 --> 00:58:28.850
to an A.T.M. Card.

1427
00:58:28.919 --> 00:58:30.265
You're gonna click that option

1428
00:58:30.334 --> 00:58:31.438
and read me the four digits

1429
00:58:31.508 --> 00:58:33.406
that appear in the box.

1430
00:58:33.475 --> 00:58:35.719
It is that easy.

1431
00:58:35.788 --> 00:58:38.618
-No. it's not.
-I'm sorry?

1432
00:58:38.687 --> 00:58:39.964
Last time I checked. there's

1433
00:58:40.033 --> 00:58:41.863
no "I" in "team" or felony grand

1434
00:58:41.932 --> 00:58:44.451
theft of a federal reserve bank.

1435
00:58:44.521 --> 00:58:46.557
You get that number

1436
00:58:46.626 --> 00:58:48.973
and you're gone.

1437
00:58:49.042 --> 00:58:52.114
That pin number belongs to
an A.T.M. Card I don't have

1438
00:58:52.183 --> 00:58:54.703
which belongs to an account
I don't have.

1439
00:58:54.772 --> 00:58:56.705
So unless you can find a way
to share

1440
00:58:56.774 --> 00:58:58.776
your little high-tech heist.
you're stuck.

1441
00:58:58.845 --> 00:58:59.984
I suggest you begin by telling

1442
00:59:00.053 --> 00:59:01.296
me what it is we're stealing

1443
00:59:01.365 --> 00:59:03.332
and. uh. the clock's ticking.

1444
00:59:03.401 --> 00:59:05.783
Okay. fine.

1445
00:59:05.852 --> 00:59:08.372
Nickels and dimes...
Lots of 'em.

1446
00:59:08.441 --> 00:59:10.201
[Coins jingle]

1447
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:12.618
What. why?
Why are we stealing change?

1448
00:59:12.687 --> 00:59:14.620
Why?
Because I could.

1449
00:59:14.689 --> 00:59:18.865
Getting greedy with what
you want to steal will only
get you caught.

1450
00:59:18.934 --> 00:59:23.007
You have to ask yourself why you
think you can get away with it.

1451
00:59:23.076 --> 00:59:27.874
Know why and the what.
where and how will follow.

1452
00:59:27.943 --> 00:59:31.706
Okay. so... How are
we gonna rob a bank

1453
00:59:31.775 --> 00:59:34.053
and. and actually
get away with it?

1454
00:59:34.122 --> 00:59:37.504
Ever notice how everything
has some piddly-ass
surcharge added?

1455
00:59:37.574 --> 00:59:39.610
Yeah. now you're speaking
to the choir. my friend.

1456
00:59:39.679 --> 00:59:44.339
Now I need you
to listen closely and be
really honest here.

1457
00:59:44.408 --> 00:59:45.685
Shoot.

1458
00:59:45.754 --> 00:59:47.342
Do you always balance
your checkbook?

1459
00:59:47.411 --> 00:59:49.171
Oh... I mean. I...

1460
00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.966
-I've done it.
-Yeah. right.

1461
00:59:51.035 --> 00:59:53.762
And even if you do that.
do you ever. ever. ever check

1462
00:59:53.831 --> 00:59:57.352
to see if the bank didn't
charge you a surcharge

1463
00:59:57.421 --> 00:59:59.147
for an A.T.M. transaction?

1464
00:59:59.216 --> 01:00:00.286
You had me at checkbook.

1465
01:00:00.355 --> 01:00:02.357
Which brings us back to why.

1466
01:00:02.426 --> 01:00:03.910
It's simple.

1467
01:00:03.979 --> 01:00:06.292
The world is too complicated
to keep track of.

1468
01:00:06.361 --> 01:00:12.194
Life is made of a million
moments. transactions. passwords
and pin numbers to memorize.

1469
01:00:12.263 --> 01:00:14.472
It's not that we don't want
to keep track. it's just

1470
01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:18.373
that it's not worth our time
until you add it up.

1471
01:00:18.442 --> 01:00:21.859
How do we rob a bank and why
will we get away with it?

1472
01:00:21.928 --> 01:00:23.378
Add up the chump change.

1473
01:00:23.447 --> 01:00:25.311
We're stealing surcharges

1474
01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:26.519
and it's missing money

1475
01:00:26.588 --> 01:00:29.108
no one is missing.

1476
01:00:29.177 --> 01:00:31.386
Yeah. but what about
the bank missing it?

1477
01:00:31.455 --> 01:00:32.767
We have a problem.

1478
01:00:32.836 --> 01:00:34.251
Yeah. that's what
I'm asking about.

1479
01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.735
No. no. no. it's uh...

1480
01:00:35.804 --> 01:00:38.324
Another kind of problem.

1481
01:00:38.393 --> 01:00:39.774
Oh...

1482
01:00:39.843 --> 01:00:41.568
I wasn't planning on
getting locked in here.

1483
01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:42.915
We've been in here for hours.

1484
01:00:42.984 --> 01:00:43.985
I couldn't hold it forever.

1485
01:00:44.054 --> 01:00:45.400
Yeah. yeah. yeah. okay.

1486
01:00:45.469 --> 01:00:46.401
of course.

1487
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:50.336
Um... Well...

1488
01:00:50.405 --> 01:00:52.407

All right. um...

1492
01:00:57.895 --> 01:01:01.140
Oh wait. I've got an idea.

1493
01:01:01.209 --> 01:01:02.417
Nick. hold on.

1494
01:01:02.486 --> 01:01:04.281
What's going on?

1495
01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:06.386
Don't ask.

[Jessica types...]

01:01:08.561 --> 01:01:10.839
[Jinx] What are you doing?

1498
01:01:10.908 --> 01:01:12.358

1501
01:01:24.025 --> 01:01:25.992
No way!

1502
01:01:26.061 --> 01:01:28.270
Beggars can't be
choosers. man.

1503
01:01:28.339 --> 01:01:31.032
So. what about
the bank noticing?

1504
01:01:31.101 --> 01:01:35.277
[Nick] Well. like I said.
you never rob the bank.

1505
01:01:35.346 --> 01:01:38.280
-At least. not noticeably.
-Stop it!

1506
01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:40.973
[Nick] So what if. for every
dozen A.T.M. transactions.

1507
01:01:41.042 --> 01:01:46.150
you simply divert one surcharge
into an account already set up
within the bank.

1508
01:01:46.219 --> 01:01:48.946
Nothing more than missing
nickels and no way to track it.

1509
01:01:49.015 --> 01:01:50.776
Yeah. I'm all for
the economics lesson but.

1510
01:01:50.845 --> 01:01:54.607
-uh. what are we really talking
about here?
-Honestly?

1511
01:01:54.676 --> 01:01:57.852
Honestly is the only choice
you have if you ever want to see
any of that money.

1512
01:01:57.921 --> 01:02:02.995
Okay... $8.266.500.

Can you hear me now?

01:02:09.553 --> 01:02:11.486
That's a lot of transactions.

1516
01:02:11.555 --> 01:02:13.488

add up.

And no one's on to you?

Why? The stolen money
never left the bank.

1520
01:02:19.563 --> 01:02:25.051
The irony is. it is all just
sitting in legitimate
grant liberty accounts.

Waiting to be withdrawn.

1522
01:02:26.604 --> 01:02:28.330
That's right.

1523
01:02:28.399 --> 01:02:30.988
As long as you have a valid
pin number to those accounts.

1524
01:02:31.057 --> 01:02:33.542
you can just slowly withdraw it.
using nothing more

1525
01:02:33.611 --> 01:02:35.061
than an A.T.M. card.

1526
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:36.718
No one would ever notice.

1527
01:02:36.787 --> 01:02:38.789
How to rob a bank.

1528
01:02:38.858 --> 01:02:42.068
And actually get away
with it.

1529
01:02:42.137 --> 01:02:44.070
If I'm not mistaken.
we'd better work out a deal

1530
01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:46.486
before there's nothing worth
working out. so you give us

1531
01:02:46.555 --> 01:02:48.765
your account numbers
and we'll assign the pin

1532
01:02:48.834 --> 01:02:50.836
to a new A.T.M. card.
-No deal.

1533
01:02:50.905 --> 01:02:52.389
If I just give you the accounts.

1534
01:02:52.458 --> 01:02:54.494
giving you the accounts
is like giving me the pin.

1535
01:02:54.563 --> 01:02:55.944
No guarantee the other

1536

trust somebody.

would be sufficient.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.567
No. my pin.
We assign my pin number

1548

to Nick's accounts.

1549
01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:34.914
That way. only I know my pin

1550
01:03:34.983 --> 01:03:36.467
and only Nick has the card

1551
01:03:36.536 --> 01:03:38.021
and the accounts.

1552
01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:39.816
[Nick] And?

1553
01:03:39.885 --> 01:03:43.958
See. you can't use the A.T.M.
card without my pin number

1554
01:03:44.027 --> 01:03:47.202
and without the card and the
accounts. the pin is useless.

1555
01:03:47.271 --> 01:03:48.790
We don't have
to trust each other.

1556
01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:50.481
We can meet and use
the two together

1557
01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:52.725
and then go
our separate ways.

1558
01:03:52.794 --> 01:03:55.901

1593
01:05:26.025 --> 01:05:28.234
Is your life
about buck fifty surcharges?

1594
01:05:28.303 --> 01:05:32.514
Playing bitch boy to every Simon
and Grant Liberty?

1595
01:05:32.583 --> 01:05:36.035
When are we gonna make
some choices of our own?

1596
01:05:41.075 --> 01:05:44.906
Today has been...

1597
01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:47.771
Different.

1598
01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:51.050
I think this is it.

1599
01:05:51.119 --> 01:05:53.846
You know. I think this is...

1600
01:05:53.915 --> 01:05:55.710
Life.

1601
01:05:55.779 --> 01:05:58.678
Choices like this.

1602
01:05:58.747 --> 01:06:05.547
You know. our lives aren't
made up of some big
monumental moment.

1603
01:06:05.616 --> 01:06:10.276
It's a choice here and a choice
there and life is made up

1604
01:06:10.345 --> 01:06:15.557
like that. of these
tiny moments.

1605
01:06:15.626 --> 01:06:21.287
I just... I think I'm sick
of this life.

1606
01:06:21.356 --> 01:06:28.777
So. how big can we make
this moment. Jinx?

1607
01:06:28.846 --> 01:06:33.196
And get a life?

1608
01:06:33.265 --> 01:06:34.542
Are you insane?

1609
01:06:34.611 --> 01:06:37.752
This. this is a tiny moment
to you?

1610
01:06:37.821 --> 01:06:40.306
[Chuckles]

1611
01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:41.756
Yeah. okay. yeah.

1612
01:06:41.825 --> 01:06:44.828
It's... It's a big moment.

1613
01:06:44.897 --> 01:06:48.073
It's a... Yeah.

1614
01:06:48.142 --> 01:06:49.764
But the principle's the same.

1615
01:06:49.833 --> 01:06:50.765
You know. make a choice.

1616
01:06:50.834 --> 01:06:52.767
What are we gonna do?

1617
01:06:52.836 --> 01:06:55.080
What are you gonna do?

1618
01:06:55.149 --> 01:07:00.188
I'm gonna get my 20 bucks.
and then some.

1619
01:07:00.257 --> 01:07:05.124
Right. yeah. let's do this.

1620
01:07:05.193 --> 01:07:07.402
Enter your pin.
[music plays]

1621
01:07:07.471 --> 01:07:10.957
So this little box is the key
to our fortune. huh?

1622
01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.442
[Jessica chuckles]

1623
01:07:12.511 --> 01:07:13.788
[computer beeps]

1624
01:07:13.857 --> 01:07:15.514
There. that's it.

1625
01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:17.067
We're done.

1626
01:07:17.136 --> 01:07:18.793
Now what?

1627
01:07:18.862 --> 01:07:21.796
[Jessica types]

1628
01:07:21.865 --> 01:07:22.969
Now...

1629
01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.074
We go.

1630
01:07:24.143 --> 01:07:26.939
[music plays]

1631
01:07:27.008 --> 01:07:28.630
[Nick] Excuse me. guys?

1632
01:07:28.699 --> 01:07:31.426
It just occurred to me
we have a problem.

1633
01:07:31.495 --> 01:07:32.738
What's up?

1634
01:07:32.807 --> 01:07:35.844
Well. you have no way out.

1635
01:07:35.913 --> 01:07:37.536
What?

1636
01:07:37.605 --> 01:07:38.951
Well...

1637
01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:41.540
She doesn't have a way out.

1638
01:07:42.886 --> 01:07:44.163
What do you mean?

1639
01:07:44.232 --> 01:07:45.475
She's got the scam
with the cops.

1640
01:07:45.544 --> 01:07:47.684
They think she's one
of the hostages.

1641
01:07:47.753 --> 01:07:51.653
Okay. well. that doesn't
solve the "Simon" problem.

1642
01:07:51.722 --> 01:07:54.173
Even if you wait until the cops
storm the place.

1643
01:07:54.242 --> 01:07:56.210
he's not going quietly.

1644
01:07:56.279 --> 01:08:00.835
He can easily turn her in
when he finds out she's
not busted with him.

1645
01:08:00.904 --> 01:08:04.494
No. no. not after all this.

1646
01:08:10.948 --> 01:08:13.158
Hold on.

1647
01:08:13.227 --> 01:08:17.058
[Phone ringing...]

1648
01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:18.680
Officer Degepse here.

1649
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:21.614
Sorry my signal died
but I'm back in a good zone.

1650
01:08:21.683 --> 01:08:23.720
Yay--any news?

1651
01:08:23.789 --> 01:08:25.998
Simon says he appreciates
your show of good faith

1652
01:08:26.067 --> 01:08:29.760
and in return. he's willing
to release two hostages.

1653
01:08:31.969 --> 01:08:33.039
...Me and Jessica.

1654
01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.559
No shit?
Really?

1655
01:08:35.628 --> 01:08:37.182
Okay. we got you covered.

1656
01:08:37.251 --> 01:08:39.874
...We've got you covered. look.

1657
01:08:39.943 --> 01:08:43.567
All right. look... Listen...

1658
01:08:43.636 --> 01:08:45.293
Make your way out slowly.

1659
01:08:45.362 --> 01:08:47.192
We'll take care of the rest.

1660
01:08:47.261 --> 01:08:49.021
This will all be over soon.

1661
01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:51.817
So I'll tell Simon
you're ready for the release.

1662
01:08:53.646 --> 01:08:56.373
Now we're cooking
with gasoline.

1663
01:08:57.443 --> 01:08:59.169
Do you have any way
of reaching Simon?

1664
01:08:59.238 --> 01:09:01.654
Yeah. I can call Roger.

1665
01:09:01.723 --> 01:09:04.174
-Who?
-His...muscle. [Laughs]

1666
01:09:04.243 --> 01:09:05.762
The other guy on the team. here.

1667
01:09:05.831 --> 01:09:07.936
he gave me his number in case
of complications.

1668
01:09:08.005 --> 01:09:09.731
I think this qualifies
as a complication.

1669
01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:14.011
Yeah... Nick. we're gonna
call you back.

1670
01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.875
[Phone ringing...]

1671
01:09:15.944 --> 01:09:17.601
-[Man] Hello?
-I gotta talk to Simon.

1672
01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:19.845
He's kind of busy
at the moment... Who's this?

1673
01:09:19.914 --> 01:09:21.881
Roger. put him on the phone.

1674
01:09:23.469 --> 01:09:27.542
[Metal gently clinking]

1675
01:09:32.064 --> 01:09:34.480
-Hello?
-Hey. it's me. Jinx.

1676
01:09:34.549 --> 01:09:36.482
Hey. Jinx. what's up?

1677

[Inserts clip into pistol]

1678
01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:41.763
I have to admit. you've really
got me worried now.

1679
01:09:41.832 --> 01:09:43.524
[Click]
[Jinx] Sorry for the wait.

1680
01:09:43.593 --> 01:09:44.870
but we better make a deal fast.

1681
01:09:44.939 --> 01:09:46.458
I just got off the phone
with Degepse.

1682
01:09:46.527 --> 01:09:48.253
-What'd he say?
-He says if they don't see

1683
01:09:48.322 --> 01:09:50.255
cooperation from you
in five minutes.

1684
01:09:50.324 --> 01:09:51.946
they're storming
the place with swat.

1685
01:09:52.015 --> 01:09:53.948
Shit... Shit.

1686
01:09:54.017 --> 01:09:55.743
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

1687
01:09:55.812 --> 01:09:57.952

1691
01:10:04.786 --> 01:10:07.962
Okay. [Exhales twice quickly]

1692
01:10:08.031 --> 01:10:09.032
What do they want?

1693
01:10:09.101 --> 01:10:10.275
You're not gonna like it.

1694
01:10:10.344 --> 01:10:12.449
What-- what is it?

1695
01:10:12.518 --> 01:10:15.866
They want at least one
hostage released and...

1696
01:10:15.935 --> 01:10:18.835
And? And what?

1697
01:10:18.904 --> 01:10:21.907
One of you has
to turn yourself in.

1698
01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:31.848
Fine.

1699
01:10:31.917 --> 01:10:33.298
They can have Jessica.

1700
01:10:33.367 --> 01:10:34.816
Really?

1701
01:10:34.885 --> 01:10:36.370
You'll turn her in
just like that?

1702
01:10:36.439 --> 01:10:37.543
What do I care?

1703
01:10:37.612 --> 01:10:39.131
You want out and I want in.

1704
01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.926
Take Jessica as your insurance.

1705
01:10:40.995 --> 01:10:42.168
And the cops get their precious

1706
01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:44.999
negotiation pawn. yeah?

1707
01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:49.555

What's wrong?

1711
01:10:58.081 --> 01:11:00.083
This is our way out.

1712
01:11:00.152 --> 01:11:02.430
Yeah...

1713
01:11:03.397 --> 01:11:06.296
Yeah... [Laughs ruefully]

1714

[emotionally] You know. um...

anyone has ever done for me.

Yeah.

1719
01:11:36.671 --> 01:11:38.949
Right. let's get the hell
out of here.

rendezvous...

Oh. yeah?

1724
01:11:57.761 --> 01:11:59.798
Is that a second date?

1725
01:12:01.455 --> 01:12:03.077
You better tie me up.

1726
01:12:05.113 --> 01:12:07.909
So Simon still thinks
I'm your hostage.

1727
01:12:07.978 --> 01:12:09.359

1728
01:12:09.428 --> 01:12:11.465
