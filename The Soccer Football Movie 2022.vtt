3
00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:15.750
Tonight. if there were
a moon. it'd be full to the brim

4
00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:20.041
with pure anticipation for this
historic moment in football.

5
00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:21.000
Or soccer.

6
00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:23.583
But in most places. it's football.

7
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:27.916
But no matter what you call the game.
it all starts with a ball.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.208
And a person.

9
00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:30.458
And their foot.

10
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:35.916
This nail-biter comes down to Zlatan.
in the final game before the All-Star Cup.

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.625
I'm Rob Stone.

12
00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:40.250
Will Zlatan make it happen?

13
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.875
Zlatan always makes it happen.

14
00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.333
Was he… Was he pointing at me?

15
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:51.333
Yes. I'm pointing at you. Rob Stone.

16
00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:54.125
How are you even hearing me and--

17
00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:56.666
Dude. concentrate on the penalty shot.

18
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.791
What? This shot?

19
00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:03.750
Zlatan shoots. And Zlatan…

20
00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:09.125
…scores!

21
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:13.833
Now that is good football. Or soccer.

22
00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:16.666
-But mostly football. I'm Rob Stone.

23
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.916
In a mere 24 hours.

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.166
someone will go home with
that prestigious. shiny All-Star Cup.

25
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.708
Until then. fans will be asking themselves

26
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:32.791
who will be named
the All-Star Cup All-Star

27
00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:36.541
of all All-Stars of all time?

28
00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:37.750
-That's easy.
-Huh?

29
00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:40.583
It will be… Ah! Zlatan!

30
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.666
Spoiler alert! Aha!

31
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.000
As I was trying to say--

32
00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:46.833
Zlatan!

33
00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:49.250
Okay!

34
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:50.833
Zlatan!

35
00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.750
Let's find out what soccer fans think.

36
00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:00.250
Weird Al Yankovic! What's your take?

37
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:09.000
I think the All-Star Cup All-Star
of all All-Stars of all time will be

38
00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:10.083
me!

39
00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:16.041
Oh. that's rich.
And by rich. I mean hilarious and dumb.

40
00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:17.375
Hey. hear me out.

41
00:02:17.458 --> 00:02:22.541
Wouldn't I be the All-Star Cup All-Star
of all All-Stars of all time if I were to.

42
00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:24.708
oh. I don't know.

43
00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:30.250
borrow a teensy bit of soccer skills
from each player using advanced genetics?

44
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.000
Weird Al knows advanced genetics?

45
00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:35.500
Know it? It's one of my doctorates!

46
00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:39.583
How else could I have come up
with "I Think I'm a Clone Now"?

47
00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:41.875
How. Rob? How could I have?

48
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:44.625
Weird Al?

49
00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:46.083
Yes. Rob Stone?

50
00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.833
Are you a mad scientist?

51
00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:51.083
I mean…

52
00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:53.333
Who would say yes to that. Rob?

53
00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:56.541
Would a mad scientist
actually say yes to that?

54
00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:59.083
Well. you're not saying
you aren't a mad scientist.

55
00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:04.041
What I'm saying is. Weird Al can do
anything he sets his mind to.

56
00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:05.208
Observe.

57
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:07.958
This free kick. into that net.

58
00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:15.458
Ow! Ow. man!

59
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:19.708
There we go!

60
00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:22.416
And now time for some fan commentary.

61
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.875
Hey. you. tall person in a trench coat.

62
00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958
-We're spotted.
-He's coming!

63
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:31.500
Who do you think will be named
the All-Star of all All-Stars?

64
00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:32.541
Megan! Megan!

65
00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:34.125
-It's Ronaldo.
-Megan!

66
00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:36.291
-Quit punching.
-Hey!

67
00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:38.666
And we're done here!

68
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.625
We'll see you at the All-Star game.

69
00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:43.208
For now. my name is--

70
00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:44.750
Rob Stone. think fast!

71
00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:48.791
-We lost the coat!
-Also losing balance.

72
00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:53.041
We are not losing my chance
to get a selfie with Megan Rapinoe!

73
00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:55.250
Nautai. not the time!

74
00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.125
- Whoa!

75
00:03:57.208 --> 00:03:58.958
-We're going down!

76
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.750
We're gonna get caught.

77
00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:03.958
Quiet. Palio.

78
00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:05.625
Rapinoe. where you at?

79
00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:07.708
Nautai. not the time!

80
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.083
I think not!

81
00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:14.416
-Hmm.
-What was that for. Zana?

82
00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:16.791
Goalie's instinct.

83
00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:20.750
We should make this fast.
Security's gonna come soon.

84
00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:24.041
Mama needs a Megan selfie.
let's not waste a second.

85
00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:26.083
Is that who I think it is?

86
00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.583
-Amazing! This can't be real!
-What?

87
00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:34.416
I think not!

88
00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:37.208
Ooh. Whoops.

89
00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:39.125
You blocked Zlatan.

90
00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:40.833
-Zana. I'll miss you.
-We're dead!

91
00:04:41.416 --> 00:04:42.958
Goalie's instinct?

92
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:47.958
You got talent.
Not Zlatan's talent. but still talent.

93
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:51.500
Don't feel bad though.
no one has Zlatan's talent.

94
00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:52.458
That is true.

95
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:54.041
-Nautai does.
-What?

96
00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:56.833
At least when it comes to juggling. which.

97
00:04:56.916 --> 00:05:00.291
from this display.
appears to be Zlatan's kryptonite.

98
00:05:00.375 --> 00:05:01.875
Oh. snap!

99
00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.791
I propose a juggle-off.

100
00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:06.416
Double snap.

101
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.708
The confidence I admire.

102
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:12.708
But Zlatan is a pro.
A pro does not juggle against a kid.

103
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:15.833
Oh. you mean against a kid
you're afraid will beat you?

104
00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:20.833
Then again.
I'm currently off the clock. which means

105
00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:23.000
Zlatan is happy to trounce anyone.

106
00:05:23.083 --> 00:05:26.875
And he will trounce you.
Come on. Tai. be reasonable.

107
00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.375
Reasonable?

108
00:05:28.458 --> 00:05:29.375
Not my thing.

109
00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:32.291
All right. Make space. people.
Juggle-off on.

110
00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:37.125
Allow Zlatan to show you
how to juggle like Zlatan.

111
00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:09.041
-Zlatan rules!
-Yeah!

112
00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:11.375
Uh. wow. tough act to follow.

113
00:06:11.458 --> 00:06:13.416
Nautai can always back out.

114
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.041
Ah. but Nautai never will.

115
00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:18.375
Can I get a "juggle-off on"?

116
00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:20.458
Technically it was never off.

117
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:22.500
Just say. "Juggle-off on."

118
00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:25.750
I can turn it off. then turn it on.
Would that work?

119
00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:27.458
Juggle-off on!

120
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.500
-Nautai!
-Nice!

121
00:06:43.583 --> 00:06:48.125
Zlatan is impressed. but also curious
how you four got in here.

122
00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:49.625
We snuck in to meet you.

123
00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:52.916
We're a street football team.
We've been saving for tickets.

124
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.291
It's not easy though.
we live in the trailers by the old dump.

125
00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:58.791
Down the Dead River from the new dump.

126
00:06:58.875 --> 00:07:02.125
The point is. we started a business
so we could buy tickets.

127
00:07:02.208 --> 00:07:05.125
And it took off.
thanks to being inspired by you.

128
00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:08.166
And Megan!
By the by. do you guys hang out?

129
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.708
Trying to get a selfie.

130
00:07:09.791 --> 00:07:11.750
Nautai. not the time.

131
00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:14.708
Call us the Creature Catchers.

132
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:16.291
"Pest control"?

133
00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:20.916
Highest-rated pest control on Yelp.
Five stars. Whoop-whoop!

134
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.500
We run toward the stuff
everyone else runs away from.

135
00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:26.333
That's our slogan. Woot.

136
00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:28.000
And this is our commercial.

137
00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:30.708
Oh. what? Gah!

138
00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:33.666
That is a rabbit's tongue. Ugh.

139
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.166
And what are those zappy things?

140
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.958
Homemade electro-<i>bolas.</i>

141
00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:43.833
And those? What is that?
Let me guess. homemade electro-balls?

142
00:07:43.916 --> 00:07:45.875
Homemade stun balls.

143
00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:50.625
Your every Yelp star has been earned.
my friends.

144
00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:55.250
Zlatan's never seen anyone fight off
a rabid raccoon using a back-heel.

145
00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:57.791
-Zlatan likes it!
-All you. O'Dang.

146
00:07:57.875 --> 00:08:02.500
I got inspired by your back-heel goal
against Bastia in 2013.

147
00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:06.958
Seems like soccer's
more than just a game for you.

148
00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:09.958
We bring soccer
into every aspect of our lives.

149
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:12.291
Makes it hard to go to libraries.

150
00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:13.708
I can imagine.

151
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:16.666
Only a great team could have caught
a rabid skunk.

152
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.875
Teamwork is how you avoid
getting sprayed by stink.

153
00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:24.083
Like playing against Ronaldo.
Anyway. you're good at what you do.

154
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.750
Yes. yes. yes!

155
00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:31.041
Or maybe you're incredibly stupid
and very lucky.

156
00:08:31.125 --> 00:08:34.125
But either way.
you've earned those tickets.

157
00:08:34.208 --> 00:08:36.791
Tickets sold out fast.
so we're out of luck.

158
00:08:36.875 --> 00:08:38.750
Good thing I got four extra.

159
00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:40.791
They are all yours.

160
00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:45.083
if you promise you got my back
with any creatures that need catching.

161
00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:53.875
Hello?

162
00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:56.416
-Deal!
-Deal!

163
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.625
Yes. yes!

164
00:08:57.708 --> 00:08:59.583
Thank you so much.

165
00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:04.291
I mean. all we wanted to do is say thanks
and give you a coupon. And now this?

166
00:09:04.375 --> 00:09:05.375
Ooh.

167
00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:09.958
Zlatan didn't get to the top
by turning down coupons.

168
00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:13.458
I'll get the tickets.
Back in two minutes. Don't move.

169
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:16.333
-I can't even!
-An itch on my arm!

170
00:09:16.416 --> 00:09:17.708
Don't move!

171
00:09:20.208 --> 00:09:22.916
Nothing Zlatan likes more
than coming through

172
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.541
on a promise to his fans.

173
00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:27.791
And not getting distracted at all.

174
00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:28.916
What's that?

175
00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.791
A present! To Zlatan?

176
00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:37.250
"Open me." I sure will. mystery gift.

177
00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:40.291
Oh! I hope it's a jetpack.

178
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.791
Eh. already got one.

179
00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:49.000
Now. a jetpack. there's a mystery gift.

180
00:09:49.083 --> 00:09:50.416
Ah…

181
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.000
They all want selfies.

182
00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:54.500
Gotta make my ponytail pretty for selfies.

183
00:09:54.583 --> 00:09:56.208
-What the…

184
00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:04.541
Ew!

185
00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:09.708
-Was that Zlatan?
-That sounded bad.

186
00:10:09.791 --> 00:10:12.750
-I'll just itch real quick. yeah?
-Don't move!

187
00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:26.125
Oh.

188
00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:28.625
A cutie little slug baby.

189
00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:31.375
What's your name. sluggy baby?

190
00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:36.291
Lovely! Is that a family name?

191
00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:38.666
Slug baby?

192
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.041
-O'Dang. wait!
-He said don't move! Stay frozen!

193
00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:48.541
Can't hear you. running away!

194
00:10:48.625 --> 00:10:50.250
That's better.

195
00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:52.000
Zlatan! You all right?

196
00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:55.500
Sluggy? You there? Sluggy?

197
00:11:01.583 --> 00:11:04.916
Phew! Slug baby. come on out.

198
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.666
Zlatan's taking you
to the slug baby orphanage.

199
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.208
Or I can squash you.

200
00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:12.250
Your choice. tough guy.

201
00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:29.291
Zlatan. you okay?

202
00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:32.458
Stay in there.
I'm hunting a green glowy thing.

203
00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:37.333
Slug!

204
00:11:37.416 --> 00:11:40.041
Yeah. exactly. a slug!

205
00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:41.208
No. behind you!

206
00:11:46.916 --> 00:11:47.916
Zlatan!

207
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.166
Hey. Get off my ponytail!

208
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.375
It's my best feature.
after my talent and face!

209
00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:58.291
Get off!

210
00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:03.666
No! Do not. worm!

211
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.291
What's happening?

212
00:12:11.375 --> 00:12:14.583
No. this was a new uniform!

213
00:12:14.666 --> 00:12:16.833
No. My lucky socks!

214
00:12:21.625 --> 00:12:23.000
No…

215
00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:31.041
What happened?

216
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:34.166
Uh. there was an incident.

217
00:12:35.875 --> 00:12:38.791
What kind of incident causes that?

218
00:12:38.875 --> 00:12:44.250
What kind?
The mutant Zlatan kind!

219
00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:53.083
Now. before he became a mutant. did he…

220
00:12:53.166 --> 00:12:54.833
Did he give you the tickets?

221
00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:56.500
No.

222
00:12:56.583 --> 00:13:00.375
No!

223
00:13:33.166 --> 00:13:35.708
-Get the goo dripping.
-I'm getting it.

224
00:13:35.791 --> 00:13:36.833
-Say cheese!
-Yes.

225
00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:39.125
A neon slug hatched out of a soccer ball.

226
00:13:39.208 --> 00:13:41.541
then turned Zlatan
into a rampaging mutant.

227
00:13:42.541 --> 00:13:43.875
-Hello?
-Cheese!

228
00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:47.250
So 911 hung up. We're on our own.

229
00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:50.625
Well. guess we're heading home.

230
00:13:50.708 --> 00:13:55.625
We promised Zlatan we'd have his back
with creatures that needed catching.

231
00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:59.000
Turns out. he's the creature.

232
00:13:59.083 --> 00:14:01.500
Oh. I'm all for keeping promises.

233
00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:05.500
But I'm also all for
not getting killed by Mutant Zlatan.

234
00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:09.708
I hear that. Palio. Alone.
each of us would definitely get killed.

235
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:12.250
But remember what Zlatan said?

236
00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:15.083
We catch creatures. We play football.

237
00:14:15.166 --> 00:14:18.208
If there was ever anyone
to do this. it's us.

238
00:14:19.916 --> 00:14:23.750
-I know you're scared. I'm scared.
-I'm scared too.

239
00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:24.791
I'm fine.

240
00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:28.291
We might be scared.
but at least we're scared together.

241
00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:32.250
as a team.
and we're gonna find Zlatan as a team.

242
00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:36.500
We might get brutally slaughtered.
but it'll be a team slaughter.

243
00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:37.708
Good speech.

244
00:14:38.666 --> 00:14:41.458
-How are we gonna find him?

245
00:14:41.541 --> 00:14:46.583
How hard can it be to find a rampaging.
mutated. neon-green football legend?

246
00:14:57.333 --> 00:15:01.750
Mutant Zlatan smash you all!

247
00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:03.791
Let's suit up and get out there.

248
00:15:03.875 --> 00:15:07.208
Before we risk our lives.
can we get a five-second soccer break?

249
00:15:07.291 --> 00:15:08.708
Please?

250
00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:11.708
You know I want to.
but there's no time. We've gotta suit up.

251
00:15:11.791 --> 00:15:15.208
Come on. five seconds.
I need a recharge. Please?

252
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:17.666
Hey. keep it down out there!

253
00:15:18.791 --> 00:15:21.750
Just a quiet five-second soccer break?

254
00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:25.541
Nautai. Mutant Zlatan is on the loose.
This is no time to--

255
00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:27.708
-Hey!
-Watch this!

256
00:15:27.791 --> 00:15:30.125
-Bam! GOAT.

257
00:15:30.791 --> 00:15:33.083
I'll give you a GOAT.

258
00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.291
Hey. keep it down out there!

259
00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:51.375
He's big.

260
00:15:51.458 --> 00:15:52.958
He's terrifying.

261
00:15:53.041 --> 00:15:53.916
He stinks!

262
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.250
Let's go get him!

263
00:15:55.333 --> 00:15:58.083
-Cue the suit-up music.
-We're suiting up?

264
00:15:58.166 --> 00:15:59.250
Yeah! Suit up!

265
00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:01.375
-Sweet suit-up music.

266
00:16:01.458 --> 00:16:03.750
Ooh. these color cards are new.

267
00:16:03.833 --> 00:16:06.041
Bright and cheerful. I like!

268
00:16:08.458 --> 00:16:09.875
O'Dang. why all the racket?

269
00:16:11.875 --> 00:16:14.416
-Palio. see you next fall!

270
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.750
-Ooh. love the new sneeze guard. Zana.

271
00:16:16.833 --> 00:16:18.833
I buttoned my sleeves together!

272
00:16:18.916 --> 00:16:20.125
Vintage Palio.

273
00:16:20.208 --> 00:16:21.125
Let's go!

274
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.833
Creature Catchers!

275
00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:26.625
-Did I mess up?
-You said it before you jumped.

276
00:16:26.708 --> 00:16:28.833
-It's as you jump.
-You say it and then jump.

277
00:16:34.708 --> 00:16:37.750
Stupid clothes. Stupid rope!

278
00:16:37.833 --> 00:16:41.416
-How about you keep it down!

279
00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:44.083
-He's close.

280
00:16:44.166 --> 00:16:45.541
I can smell him.

281
00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:47.291
-Oh. no.
-Bingo!

282
00:16:47.375 --> 00:16:49.208
Oh. please. After you.

283
00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:52.625
<i>There have been sightings</i>
<i>of a rampaging Zlatan.</i>

284
00:16:52.708 --> 00:16:56.041
<i>far more glowy and green than usual.</i>

285
00:16:56.125 --> 00:16:58.416
<i>We can only speculate as to why.</i>

286
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.541
<i>My money is on superpowers</i>
<i>from outer space.</i>

287
00:17:03.166 --> 00:17:06.541
<i>Let's go to the phones.</i>
<i>Caller X. what's your take?</i>

288
00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:09.666
My take is the bad guy is a genius.

289
00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:12.125
<i>You've talked to the bad guy?</i>

290
00:17:12.208 --> 00:17:13.750
<i>Who is it. Caller X?</i>

291
00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:17.208
It's me. Rob. Obviously. I'm the bad guy.

292
00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:21.416
I'm calling with a voice modulator
and boasting in a coy manner.

293
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.083
Who else could it possibly be
other than a bad guy?

294
00:17:25.166 --> 00:17:27.125
Who. Rob. who?

295
00:17:27.208 --> 00:17:30.708
<i>Hey. no need</i>
<i>to get snippy. Caller X.</i>

296
00:17:30.791 --> 00:17:33.583
If the bad guy wants to snip. he'll snip!

297
00:17:33.666 --> 00:17:35.000
Snip. snip. snip!

298
00:17:35.083 --> 00:17:37.250
<i>Caller X mutated Zlatan?</i>

299
00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:41.375
That's right.
Zlatan won't be the last All-Star either.

300
00:17:41.458 --> 00:17:44.708
Soon. I'll have talent
from every All-Star.

301
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:55.416
My voice modulator!

302
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.916
As I was saying…

303
00:18:00.708 --> 00:18:05.666
<i>Say what you will about Caller X.</i>
<i>but that is a mighty fine evil laugh.</i>

304
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:06.750
<i>I'm Rob Stone.</i>

305
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:11.250
Rapinoe moves in on the goal.
victory in sight.

306
00:18:18.041 --> 00:18:21.250
McCready isn't making a move
as Rapinoe shoots.

307
00:18:23.541 --> 00:18:27.166
Oh! Last-minute steal by McCready!

308
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.250
Rapinoe has been defeated by her own pet!

309
00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:32.000
Unbelievable!

310
00:18:32.666 --> 00:18:34.541
-You're so cute.

311
00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:37.041
Uh. rematch comin' right at ya.

312
00:18:40.333 --> 00:18:41.625
Huh? Huh?

313
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:43.625
Oh.

314
00:18:43.708 --> 00:18:46.791
It's a mystery gift! Maybe it's a jetpack!

315
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.625
Soccer ball? Ugh. I already got one.

316
00:18:56.833 --> 00:18:58.291
Give me that. Stop--

317
00:19:06.416 --> 00:19:07.250
Nice try.

318
00:19:07.333 --> 00:19:10.166
You wanna distract me
so you can win tug-o-war.

319
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.083
It ain't happening. buster.

320
00:19:12.166 --> 00:19:16.875
Bark all you want. won't convince me
to turn around. Not gonna happen.

321
00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.291
-McCready?

322
00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:27.791
Uh. McCready? McCready!

323
00:19:37.833 --> 00:19:40.833
-What even is that?

324
00:19:42.791 --> 00:19:44.750
Some guard dog you are.

325
00:19:49.375 --> 00:19:52.250
Where'd you go. little green guy?

326
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.250
Ugh. this job should be easy.
It's. like. made for us!

327
00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:11.166
I can't believe we lost him.

328
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.916
It's Zlatan!
And you're surprised he's beating us?

329
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.166
-No sign of him.
-Us either.

330
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.416
This makes no sense.
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

331
00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:31.375
Huh?

332
00:20:35.291 --> 00:20:37.166
Hm. Suspicious billboard.

333
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.416
We've got to keep looking.

334
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.375
I vote for a 30-second sit break.

335
00:20:46.916 --> 00:20:48.833
-Come on. Tai.
-Horrible.

336
00:20:53.916 --> 00:20:55.708
Oops. It was an accident.

337
00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:58.666
Also. it wasn't real.

338
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.666
Nautai. why keep
that inflated all the time?

339
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.333
First rule of whoopee cushion.
keep it inflated all the time.

340
00:21:05.416 --> 00:21:08.958
Huh. I thought it's
never talk about whoopee cushion.

341
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:11.333
-That's the third.
-What's the second?

342
00:21:11.416 --> 00:21:12.791
I've already said too much.

343
00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:16.708
Creature Catchers are
currently out on an emergency.

344
00:21:18.166 --> 00:21:21.666
Did you just say a glowing green slug?

345
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.291
From a football? Inside a present?

346
00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:27.083
-We're on our way!
-Do we have to?

347
00:21:28.708 --> 00:21:33.750
Whatever that was. got to make sure
it happens zero more times.

348
00:21:33.833 --> 00:21:35.166
Must call stadium.

349
00:21:35.708 --> 00:21:38.125
Find out who sent sluggy present.

350
00:21:41.791 --> 00:21:43.500
Hey. Welcome to my joke shop.

351
00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:44.958
Smell this flower.

352
00:21:45.041 --> 00:21:47.541
-Ah! Got you. It's a snake.

353
00:21:47.625 --> 00:21:50.250
This is no time for jokes.
I need to use your phone.

354
00:21:50.333 --> 00:21:52.166
Ooh. a joke phone?

355
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:53.625
A real phone.

356
00:21:53.708 --> 00:21:54.583
Nope.

357
00:21:54.666 --> 00:21:57.708
-But how about a whoopee cushion. eh?

358
00:21:57.791 --> 00:22:00.583
No! Not again!

359
00:22:00.666 --> 00:22:02.708
Hey. no need to mutate. buddy.

360
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.500
Hey. watch it!
That Fabergé vomit is vintage!

361
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:14.458
Must keep control.

362
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:20.000
Cannot fully mutate!

363
00:22:20.083 --> 00:22:20.916
Pinky!

364
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.750
At least some part of me is still normal.

365
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:30.291
Got to find out who sent me that present
and then punch them in the face!

366
00:22:34.458 --> 00:22:40.416
-Bouncy. Bouncy. Bouncy. Bouncy.

367
00:22:42.208 --> 00:22:46.708
Okay. Nautai. No bigs.
Just your all-time hero.

368
00:22:46.791 --> 00:22:47.791
You good. Tai?

369
00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:49.708
Nope. I have to scream.

370
00:22:49.791 --> 00:22:50.958
Please don't.

371
00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:58.250
Megan needs us.

372
00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:00.083
And Nautai needs a selfie!

373
00:23:03.541 --> 00:23:04.708
Hey. I'm over here.

374
00:23:09.041 --> 00:23:12.583
Is it a talking statue?
Are you a talking statue?

375
00:23:12.666 --> 00:23:14.625
No. Over here!

376
00:23:19.916 --> 00:23:22.666
Can I get a selfie?

377
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.458
Nautai. not the time.

378
00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:27.833
Yeah. what she said.
I'm hiding from a mutant slug.

379
00:23:27.916 --> 00:23:30.458
Get out of here. it's too dangerous.

380
00:23:30.541 --> 00:23:32.083
This thing's out for blood.

381
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.416
I'm waiting for
highly capable creature catchers.

382
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.708
We are them.

383
00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:40.250
You're highly capable?

384
00:23:40.333 --> 00:23:43.333
Don't worry.
We got this all taken care…

385
00:23:43.416 --> 00:23:44.375
Slug!

386
00:23:56.708 --> 00:23:58.708
Ah. so annoying.

387
00:24:00.458 --> 00:24:03.750
Careful. it might look like
a regular. slow slug.

388
00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:07.083
but I assure you it moves very--

389
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.958
Get that slug off of there. stat.

390
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:11.458
Do not let it latch on.

391
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:13.458
Is it latching on? Did it latch on?

392
00:24:13.541 --> 00:24:14.791
It latched on.

393
00:24:16.333 --> 00:24:20.208
Don't worry.
I'll rip that slug off and stomp it good.

394
00:24:26.875 --> 00:24:28.333
Can I get a selfie?

395
00:24:28.416 --> 00:24:30.291
Not the time!

396
00:24:30.375 --> 00:24:32.125
-She's really upset.

397
00:24:32.208 --> 00:24:33.583
-I think so!

398
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.291
Ew.

399
00:24:42.375 --> 00:24:43.666
Still a fan though.

400
00:24:51.708 --> 00:24:52.750
Come on!

401
00:24:59.791 --> 00:25:00.625
Yah!

402
00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:03.000
Yah!

403
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.666
She almost killed us.

404
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.291
-You okay. Tai?
-Let's go!

405
00:25:08.375 --> 00:25:09.625
Okay. guess she's fine.

406
00:25:19.291 --> 00:25:22.250
Not only is he among
the great artists of our time.

407
00:25:22.333 --> 00:25:27.208
he's also a highly respected brain surgeon
and a die-hard fan of soccer-football.

408
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:31.291
I'm proud to dedicate
this new hospital to the esteemed

409
00:25:31.375 --> 00:25:33.041
Dr. Weird Al Yankovic.

410
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.333
Mwah. Hey. y'all.
I'd love to give a speech.

411
00:25:38.416 --> 00:25:42.791
but we have a trauma patient
who needs immediate attention.

412
00:25:46.791 --> 00:25:48.708
Pinky!

413
00:25:52.041 --> 00:25:54.125
Don't worry. pinky. I save you.

414
00:25:57.791 --> 00:25:59.291
-Ah…

415
00:25:59.375 --> 00:26:03.541
Nothing like performing a nice.
delicate seven-hour surgery.

416
00:26:07.041 --> 00:26:09.291
You're the best!

417
00:26:09.375 --> 00:26:10.500
Thank you. Thank you.

418
00:26:10.583 --> 00:26:12.958
I am happy to accept this research grant

419
00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:16.458
on behalf of my wonderful.
talented and humble self.

420
00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:20.166
I'm in the middle of some
mind-blowing genetic advancements

421
00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:24.666
that will simply blow your minds!

422
00:26:26.583 --> 00:26:29.666
Which I'm too busy with
to waste time talking to you people.

423
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.333
-Ow!

424
00:26:31.416 --> 00:26:33.375
Give me that oversized check!

425
00:26:36.583 --> 00:26:39.833
And now the Mayor.
Dr. Weird Al Yankovic!

426
00:26:39.916 --> 00:26:41.375
Trusty shears. please.

427
00:26:41.458 --> 00:26:45.500
I declare this Spatula Emporium
open for business!

428
00:26:45.583 --> 00:26:48.500
Spatulas! I love spatulas!

429
00:26:48.583 --> 00:26:49.583
I love spatulas!

430
00:26:49.666 --> 00:26:50.791
Hmm.

431
00:26:50.875 --> 00:26:55.875
Mayor Weird Al is a lot nicer
than scientist Weird Al.

432
00:27:04.458 --> 00:27:06.875
Huh?

433
00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:08.208
Mm.

434
00:27:09.791 --> 00:27:12.666
-Hey. Zlatan! Stop!

435
00:27:15.416 --> 00:27:17.666
A talking fire hydrant?

436
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.791
No!

437
00:27:18.875 --> 00:27:21.666
A talking hat on a fire hydrant?

438
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.250
No. it's me.

439
00:27:24.541 --> 00:27:26.708
Up here. on your head.

440
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:28.625
Ponytail?!

441
00:27:28.708 --> 00:27:31.583
That's my name. don't wear it out.

442
00:27:31.666 --> 00:27:33.416
Since when do you talk?

443
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.625
Since that mutant slug bit me.

444
00:27:35.708 --> 00:27:39.333
He was supposed to latch onto your head
but he latched onto me.

445
00:27:39.416 --> 00:27:43.125
Now I can talk and feel and sing!

446
00:27:44.125 --> 00:27:46.916
I got bad vibes
about you going to Weird Al.

447
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Allow me to explain through song!

448
00:27:49.083 --> 00:27:52.375
Nah. nah. we don't have budget
for musical number.

449
00:27:52.458 --> 00:27:56.875
Look! Ponytail. I know you're tied tight.
but loosen up a little!

450
00:27:56.958 --> 00:28:01.333
Do what you do best.
Hang around. look pretty.

451
00:28:01.416 --> 00:28:05.458
That is what I do best.
Still. you gotta trust me. Zlatan.

452
00:28:05.541 --> 00:28:08.666
Ah. I need to find out
what's going on with this guy.

453
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.375
Now pipe down.
or I'll make you into a bun.

454
00:28:12.458 --> 00:28:15.541
Ah! A man bun! Anything but that!

455
00:28:18.291 --> 00:28:22.250
Yeesh. tall building.
I ain't so good with heights myself.

456
00:28:22.875 --> 00:28:24.875
-Uh?

457
00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:29.750
-Oh. Whoa.

458
00:28:56.875 --> 00:28:58.958
Ah!

459
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:09.250
Hey! Get your green. glowy paws
off my snickerdoodles!

460
00:29:11.125 --> 00:29:14.208
-Huh. She caught herself.
-Mission accomplished.

461
00:29:20.583 --> 00:29:22.458
Mission unaccomplished.

462
00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:28.958
Can we ever run away?

463
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:33.500
Can I get a selfie?

464
00:29:33.583 --> 00:29:36.625
Nautai. not the time!

465
00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:38.166
She's not even here.

466
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.416
Sorry. I just… I love her so much.

467
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.750
Even as a rampaging slug mutant.

468
00:29:43.833 --> 00:29:46.916
Everybody. keep your eyes peeled
for two glowing green giants.

469
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.333
Huh?

470
00:29:54.958 --> 00:29:56.458
Don't worry. we got this.

471
00:29:56.541 --> 00:29:58.750
We've been in way scarier situations.

472
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:00.083
Like what?

473
00:30:00.666 --> 00:30:04.875
Remember when we landed a plane?
It was scary. but we did it!

474
00:30:04.958 --> 00:30:07.875
O'Dang. that was a dream you had.

475
00:30:07.958 --> 00:30:09.875
But still. we did it!

476
00:30:13.875 --> 00:30:15.416
Ew!

477
00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.250
-Come on!
-Ew!

478
00:30:24.666 --> 00:30:27.625
-Can I get a selfie?
-Still not the time!

479
00:30:28.208 --> 00:30:30.875
Zana. Palio. Ready stun sticks.

480
00:30:33.583 --> 00:30:38.125
What? You can't stun-stick Megan.
She's unstunnable!

481
00:30:38.208 --> 00:30:39.583
We'll find out.

482
00:30:39.666 --> 00:30:43.416
Ready. aim. fire!

483
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:55.083
Tai!

484
00:30:56.791 --> 00:30:58.166
You got this. Tai!

485
00:31:00.375 --> 00:31:02.375
Come on! Throw it!

486
00:31:02.916 --> 00:31:04.458
I…

487
00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:07.750
I can't…

488
00:31:08.375 --> 00:31:10.875
I can't stun-bomb my hero!

489
00:31:15.958 --> 00:31:17.208
Nautai. run!

490
00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:19.583
-Get out of there!
-What?

491
00:31:23.166 --> 00:31:24.041
Oops.

492
00:31:50.625 --> 00:31:52.666
Uh. don't think I'll bend that way!

493
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.083
-Eeh.
-Oh.

494
00:32:00.333 --> 00:32:01.875
Uh. uh…

495
00:32:06.166 --> 00:32:07.500
Hey! Whoa!

496
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.541
Boy. am I glad the first rule
of whoopee cushion

497
00:32:15.625 --> 00:32:17.791
is keep it inflated at all times.

498
00:32:17.875 --> 00:32:20.708
-Can I know the second rule yet?
-Yes. my child.

499
00:32:21.541 --> 00:32:23.291
Always keep a spare.

500
00:32:29.291 --> 00:32:30.333
Deploy it again!

501
00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:44.541
Stop hitting the whoopee!

502
00:32:46.458 --> 00:32:51.166
It appears the sonic quality
of the deployment triggers the mutation.

503
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:52.666
-Oh.
-English. please.

504
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.916
Squeeze the whoopee. save the All-Stars.

505
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.375
Got it. The whoopee cushion is go.

506
00:33:07.083 --> 00:33:08.083
Oops.

507
00:33:13.375 --> 00:33:15.666
Present came from here.

508
00:33:16.666 --> 00:33:21.625
If Mayor Weird Al did this.
then he can reverse it!

509
00:33:21.708 --> 00:33:23.333
-But I won't.
-Huh?

510
00:33:23.416 --> 00:33:27.916
Hello. Zlatan.
my favorite mutant slug baby of all!

511
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Zlatan is nobody's slug. baby!

512
00:33:31.083 --> 00:33:34.416
Now spill the beans.
Doctor-Mayor-Doctor Weird Al.

513
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:39.750
Why am I a mutant?!

514
00:33:39.833 --> 00:33:44.750
I found an enzyme
that makes talent tangible and extractable

515
00:33:44.833 --> 00:33:47.250
with only a single side effect.

516
00:33:47.333 --> 00:33:49.541
A hideous mutation?

517
00:33:49.625 --> 00:33:51.708
-Let me finish!

518
00:33:51.791 --> 00:33:55.500
A hideous mutation.
The slug brings talent to the surface.

519
00:33:55.583 --> 00:33:58.666
I extract it from you
and inject it into me.

520
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:59.833
Then boom!

521
00:33:59.916 --> 00:34:02.208
Weird Al is the All-Star Cup All-Star

522
00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:05.916
of all All-Stars of all time star
of all all-time star.

523
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.375
You're doing that
by stealing Zlatan's soccer skills!

524
00:34:10.958 --> 00:34:14.791
When you put it that way.
it sounds positively brilliant.

525
00:34:14.875 --> 00:34:16.250
If I do say so.

526
00:34:16.333 --> 00:34:17.541
Yeah?

527
00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:21.416
Sounds to me like
it's not going to work out for you.

528
00:34:30.291 --> 00:34:33.791
How did Weird Al do that? To Zlatan?

529
00:34:33.875 --> 00:34:39.791
I have some of your fellow All-Stars
to thank for these new soccer skills.

530
00:34:39.875 --> 00:34:43.500
You stole All-Star talent already!

531
00:34:43.583 --> 00:34:44.958
You monster!

532
00:34:48.583 --> 00:34:49.458
Huh?

533
00:34:49.541 --> 00:34:51.416
Huh?

534
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:58.166
And I'll be even stronger
once I steal yours!

535
00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:01.333
Evil maniacal laughter!

536
00:35:01.416 --> 00:35:04.708
I think you're supposed
to actually do the laugh.

537
00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:07.000
I'm not your monkey. Zlatan!

538
00:35:10.375 --> 00:35:13.083
Ow.

539
00:35:19.541 --> 00:35:23.625
Good to go. Ms. Rapinoe. Thank you
for choosing the Creature Catchers.

540
00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:32.625
Hallelujah. happy holidays.

541
00:35:32.708 --> 00:35:37.250
Felt kind of good destroying stuff.
Eating cookies always feels good.

542
00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:41.166
But I do not wanna mutate again.

543
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.625
Slugs shouldn't bother you anymore.
Also…

544
00:35:44.708 --> 00:35:45.583
…can I get a self--

545
00:35:45.666 --> 00:35:47.291
Yes. already. jeez!

546
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.916
Selfie. selfie. selfie!

547
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.458
-You whoopee cushion kids saved my life.
-We're not called that. We're actually--

548
00:36:04.541 --> 00:36:06.833
-Hang on. whoopee cushion kids. Talk.

549
00:36:07.541 --> 00:36:08.625
Oh. no.

550
00:36:09.291 --> 00:36:13.791
Oh. no! There's a group
of paranoid All-Stars down at the stadium.

551
00:36:13.875 --> 00:36:16.750
They won't play till they know
none of them is a mutant.

552
00:36:16.833 --> 00:36:19.958
Don't worry.
count on the whoopee cushion kids.

553
00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:23.416
I mean. Creature Catchers.
You and me will find Zlatan.

554
00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.625
You go with Megan.
make sure no All-Stars got slugged.

555
00:36:26.708 --> 00:36:29.416
Once we do that. the game can go on.

556
00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.833
I got a selfie. Mm.

557
00:36:30.916 --> 00:36:33.541
Make it fast. All-Star Cup is in an hour.

558
00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.291
Selfie. selfie. selfie!

559
00:36:38.666 --> 00:36:42.625
I know I might sound insane.
but I assure you…

560
00:36:46.583 --> 00:36:49.291
Just kidding.

561
00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:55.166
Look. I didn't set out to take
all your talent. Just a drop. really.

562
00:36:55.250 --> 00:37:00.166
I thought if I could have
a drop of talent from each All-Star.

563
00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:05.291
then I'd inject it into myself and
become the greatest All-Star of all time.

564
00:37:05.375 --> 00:37:07.750
The GASOAT. as it were.

565
00:37:07.833 --> 00:37:13.791
You won't stop
until you do this to every All-Star?

566
00:37:13.875 --> 00:37:18.666
Only way to become the GASOAT
is to mutate a few All-Stars.

567
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:22.500
Now if I could remove the slug
that sucked up your talent.

568
00:37:22.583 --> 00:37:25.916
I'll just take a drop
and then be on my way…

569
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.416
Hey! Where's your slug?

570
00:37:28.916 --> 00:37:32.750
Oh. it looks like it merged
with your ponytail.

571
00:37:33.375 --> 00:37:34.458
Fascinating.

572
00:37:34.541 --> 00:37:36.833
Boo!

573
00:37:37.333 --> 00:37:39.416
-Ya!

574
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.208
Run. Zlatan!

575
00:37:41.291 --> 00:37:42.291
It talks?

576
00:37:42.875 --> 00:37:45.041
Weird Al. meet Ponytail.

577
00:37:45.125 --> 00:37:47.875
Ya-ta-ta-ta! Come on! We gotta go!

578
00:37:48.458 --> 00:37:52.916
Ponytail. prepare to meet
my trusty giant shears!

579
00:37:55.958 --> 00:37:57.791
Goodbye. trusty shears!

580
00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:59.250
Take that. Weird Al.

581
00:37:59.333 --> 00:38:01.750
And take that. trusty shears.

582
00:38:02.333 --> 00:38:05.291
Too bad I don't also have
a trusty bone saw.

583
00:38:05.375 --> 00:38:06.750
Oh. wait!

584
00:38:06.833 --> 00:38:08.541
Toodle-oo. Ponytail.

585
00:38:08.625 --> 00:38:11.375
Zlatan. don't let him cut me!

586
00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:25.583
No!

587
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.541
-Got you!

588
00:38:49.416 --> 00:38:53.375
Zlatan moves like a newborn. Why is this?

589
00:38:53.458 --> 00:38:56.500
All your talent got sucked into here.

590
00:38:56.583 --> 00:39:00.625
just waiting to be injected
into yours truly.

591
00:39:00.708 --> 00:39:04.083
What happened to taking just a drop?
You promised.

592
00:39:04.166 --> 00:39:05.500
I don't recall that.

593
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:08.875
Ta-da!

594
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.375
Ya!

595
00:39:13.458 --> 00:39:15.916
Ya! Ya! Ya!

596
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.875
Oh!

597
00:39:17.791 --> 00:39:19.750
Okay. Ponytail. give it up!

598
00:39:19.833 --> 00:39:22.541
I stole that talent fair and square.

599
00:39:22.625 --> 00:39:24.666
Stay back. Weird Al.

600
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.208
I'm a wild card.

601
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:28.583
A wild card. huh?

602
00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:31.791
If I had a nickel for every time I heard
a ponytail say that…

603
00:39:31.875 --> 00:39:35.625
Oh. yeah? Well. now you're dealing
with Zlatan's ponytail.

604
00:39:40.625 --> 00:39:43.416
Wow. I kick exactly like you. Zlatan.

605
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.333
Sweet. Hey. if you can do Kung Fu.
does that mean--

606
00:39:47.416 --> 00:39:49.916
I can already tell you that-- Ow!

607
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.125
You have definitely inherited-- Ow!

608
00:39:52.208 --> 00:39:53.791
Zlatan's Kung…

609
00:39:53.875 --> 00:39:55.208
…Fu skills…

610
00:39:55.291 --> 00:39:56.791
…in addition to his…

611
00:39:56.875 --> 00:39:58.791
…magnetic gaze.

612
00:40:01.375 --> 00:40:04.708
Wow. Zlatan.
I never knew it'd feel this incredible

613
00:40:04.791 --> 00:40:08.458
to be surging
with so much concentrated talent.

614
00:40:08.541 --> 00:40:12.666
And I never knew it would feel so awful
having it taken away.

615
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:15.791
Huh. Hey. what are you doing?

616
00:40:15.875 --> 00:40:18.958
Reattaching you. I want my talent back.

617
00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:20.708
Let's not be too hasty here.

618
00:40:20.791 --> 00:40:23.958
Oh. hey. look. Smoke bombs!

619
00:40:24.708 --> 00:40:26.625
Quick. Zlatan. kick it away!

620
00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:33.791
How did I miss that?

621
00:40:33.875 --> 00:40:36.125
Because I have all your talent.

622
00:40:36.208 --> 00:40:38.041
Don't be silly. Observe.

623
00:40:39.541 --> 00:40:44.250
Told ya. You got no more talent.

624
00:40:44.333 --> 00:40:48.375
You see?
It's all inside me now!

625
00:40:48.458 --> 00:40:51.125
Not for long. Ponytail. Yoink!

626
00:40:51.208 --> 00:40:54.833
All that talent
is about to go to its new home.

627
00:40:54.916 --> 00:40:56.875
inside Weird Al!

628
00:40:57.458 --> 00:41:01.125
-Zlatan…

629
00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:02.791
Whoo!

630
00:41:02.875 --> 00:41:04.416
I feel so

631
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.666
Zlatan-y!

632
00:41:12.208 --> 00:41:17.291
Feels good to be the All-Star game
All-Star of all All-Stars of all time!

633
00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:19.416
You didn't earn that talent!

634
00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:25.000
I'll earn bragging rights for stealing it.
And a Nobel Prize. if there's any justice.

635
00:41:25.083 --> 00:41:27.250
Anyway. victory awaits.

636
00:41:27.333 --> 00:41:31.125
-Grappling accordion. away!

637
00:41:32.291 --> 00:41:34.958
Zlatan!

638
00:41:35.041 --> 00:41:37.125
Ponytail!

639
00:41:45.833 --> 00:41:49.166
No. No. Ponytail!

640
00:41:50.291 --> 00:41:53.875
Okay. y'all. Listen up.
These weirdos may not look like much.

641
00:41:53.958 --> 00:41:57.958
but the whoopee cushion kids are no joke.
despite their joke-like name.

642
00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:01.208
These two are going to tell you
if you're a slug or not.

643
00:42:02.458 --> 00:42:06.500
Okay. everybody. What we're about to do
is serious business.

644
00:42:08.208 --> 00:42:09.750
Is that a whoopee cushion?

645
00:42:09.833 --> 00:42:12.708
-Indeed it is. soccer player number one.
-What?

646
00:42:12.791 --> 00:42:17.166
Now. before I explain. there's one thing
I must get out of the way.

647
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:20.083
Can I get a selfie?

648
00:42:20.166 --> 00:42:22.750
Hello? Already gave you one.

649
00:42:22.833 --> 00:42:24.166
Right. sorry.

650
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:26.708
As soon as I deploy this whoopee cushion.

651
00:42:26.791 --> 00:42:30.416
we'll discover if any of you
is a hideous slug mutant.

652
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.500
Do you expect us to believe

653
00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:37.500
that a fart bag will prove
which of us is a "hideous slug mutant"?

654
00:42:37.583 --> 00:42:42.000
Hey. These two were part of the team
that saved me when I got slugged.

655
00:42:42.083 --> 00:42:44.000
Give the whoopee cushion a chance.

656
00:42:44.708 --> 00:42:47.833
Sounds like something
a slug mutant would say.

657
00:42:47.916 --> 00:42:52.208
Gee. you seem to know a lot
about what slug mutants say. don't you?

658
00:42:52.708 --> 00:42:54.375
-Maybe you're a slug mutant.
-Mm.

659
00:42:54.458 --> 00:42:56.625
-It's getting real!
-I ain't a mutant!

660
00:42:56.708 --> 00:42:59.041
-I always knew you were.
-Stop fighting!

661
00:42:59.958 --> 00:43:02.500
Look at you. turning on one another.

662
00:43:02.583 --> 00:43:07.708
Soccer is a team sport. and whether
you like it or not. you're still a team.

663
00:43:07.791 --> 00:43:13.083
We'll conduct the test one at a time.
in case you all got slugged.

664
00:43:15.333 --> 00:43:17.750
I'm no mutant.
You're wasting everyone's time!

665
00:43:17.833 --> 00:43:20.875
Yeah. That's what all the mutants say.

666
00:43:28.666 --> 00:43:32.625
Don't worry. Nautai. I got your back.
Me and this broom.

667
00:43:32.708 --> 00:43:35.250
Hello. I am not a mutant.

668
00:43:35.333 --> 00:43:37.041
Squeeze the fart bag!

669
00:43:41.083 --> 00:43:43.541
Is he mutating? Are you mutating? Hmm?

670
00:43:44.541 --> 00:43:46.875
Oh. not a mutant! All good.

671
00:43:46.958 --> 00:43:48.125
Phew!

672
00:43:48.208 --> 00:43:51.125
Told ya! I knew the whole time.

673
00:43:58.458 --> 00:43:59.833
All right. I'm up.

674
00:43:59.916 --> 00:44:02.875
Don't worry.
this will be quick and painless.

675
00:44:05.791 --> 00:44:07.458
See. I told you I was…

676
00:44:07.541 --> 00:44:08.958
…right!

677
00:44:49.125 --> 00:44:50.875
Come on. Zlatan.

678
00:44:50.958 --> 00:44:53.916
Kick it. You know you can kick it.

679
00:44:56.666 --> 00:44:58.791
No!

680
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:14.791
Game starts in ten minutes.
Keep your eyes peeled for Zlatan.

681
00:45:14.875 --> 00:45:17.666
That crying hobo looks like Zlatan.

682
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:20.083
That crying hobo is Zlatan!

683
00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.416
Zlatan?

684
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:31.666
No. just a pile of talentless skin.
talentless bones. and no ponytail.

685
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.250
How does it look?

686
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.041
Uh… So how'd all this go down?

687
00:45:44.125 --> 00:45:46.416
It's a tale as old as time.

688
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.041
Weird Al stole my talent to become

689
00:45:49.125 --> 00:45:53.541
the All-Star Cup All-Star
of all All-Stars of all-time.

690
00:45:54.625 --> 00:45:57.666
And there's nothing I can do.

691
00:45:58.166 --> 00:46:00.125
You can't just give up!

692
00:46:00.208 --> 00:46:03.791
You're still Zlatan.
with or without your talent.

693
00:46:04.875 --> 00:46:08.416
Good point. but we've got to get
to the stadium before Weird Al.

694
00:46:10.833 --> 00:46:13.083
And I just learned to walk again.

695
00:46:13.166 --> 00:46:16.375
You'll have to learn to do
a lot of stuff again.

696
00:46:22.666 --> 00:46:24.458
Now try to kick the ball.

697
00:46:24.541 --> 00:46:27.125
Zlatan will not try to kick.

698
00:46:27.208 --> 00:46:28.666
Zlatan will kick.

699
00:46:34.375 --> 00:46:35.666
What's your problem?

700
00:46:36.875 --> 00:46:37.750
It's cool.

701
00:46:38.333 --> 00:46:40.041
We'll just take it slow.

702
00:46:40.125 --> 00:46:42.125
Zlatan. we need you to juggle.

703
00:46:42.208 --> 00:46:45.083
I can't. my talent has been stolen.

704
00:46:45.166 --> 00:46:47.375
All I have now is my beauty.

705
00:46:47.458 --> 00:46:50.875
Then you're gonna
have to grow some new talent.

706
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.333
Again. please.

707
00:47:08.958 --> 00:47:10.250
Again.

708
00:47:14.541 --> 00:47:17.291
Hey! Keep it down out there!

709
00:47:18.375 --> 00:47:19.500
Again.

710
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.750
Nice! You're doing it!

711
00:47:26.291 --> 00:47:27.708
Get the ball from us.

712
00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:30.916
But that seems so hard.

713
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.666
-'Tis a sad day.
-Why's that. O'Dang?

714
00:47:34.208 --> 00:47:37.125
Zlatan can't get a ball from two kids.

715
00:47:37.625 --> 00:47:40.875
Hey. watch it!
That's no way to speak to Zlatan.

716
00:47:46.041 --> 00:47:46.916
Again.

717
00:47:48.125 --> 00:47:50.208
Come on. Zlatan. you're the best.

718
00:47:58.791 --> 00:48:00.083
Again. Please.

719
00:48:14.708 --> 00:48:15.541
Again.

720
00:48:52.875 --> 00:48:54.125
That's better.

721
00:48:54.208 --> 00:48:57.500
Now I feel like Zlatan!

722
00:48:57.583 --> 00:49:02.625
I would describe the feeling.
but the world would die of envy.

723
00:49:05.041 --> 00:49:06.875
Someone's back to normal.

724
00:49:06.958 --> 00:49:10.500
Zlatan! Zlatan! Zlatan!

725
00:49:13.458 --> 00:49:18.041
<i>Attention. soccer-football fans.</i>
<i>the game will begin in two minutes.</i>

726
00:49:18.125 --> 00:49:20.791
<i>Also. has anyone seen Zlatan?</i>

727
00:49:20.875 --> 00:49:23.000
<i>Zlatan! Zlatan!</i>

728
00:49:25.666 --> 00:49:27.208
I'm a mutant.

729
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.291
You totally fell for it.

730
00:49:32.375 --> 00:49:36.125
Hey. Zlatan. what if we bring
our buddies up to the field?

731
00:49:36.208 --> 00:49:38.916
Time for the All-Stars to hit the field.

732
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.750
And we are short four players.

733
00:49:41.833 --> 00:49:44.291
So you're gonna have to join us.

734
00:49:45.708 --> 00:49:47.375
You've got the talent.

735
00:49:47.916 --> 00:49:50.125
-You just need better uniforms.

736
00:49:50.625 --> 00:49:55.166
<i>It is time</i>
<i>for an exterior establishing shot.</i>

737
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:58.041
<i>Now the interior. as the crowd goes wild.</i>

738
00:49:58.125 --> 00:50:02.833
<i>and here come the All-Stars.</i>
<i>inexplicably joined by four local youths.</i>

739
00:50:02.916 --> 00:50:04.916
<i>I. for one. am here for it.</i>

740
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:12.125
-Shouldn't we look for Weird Al?
-And Ponytail?

741
00:50:12.208 --> 00:50:14.041
You want to delay the game?

742
00:50:14.125 --> 00:50:17.083
Point taken. Let's play some soccer!

743
00:50:18.375 --> 00:50:20.000
Oh yes. let's.

744
00:50:25.541 --> 00:50:28.708
<i>Mutant Weird Al.</i>
<i>showing off his talent. or rather.</i>

745
00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:30.666
<i>every All-Star's talent.</i>

746
00:50:32.625 --> 00:50:35.458
Wow. impressive. You got skills. Weird Al.

747
00:50:35.541 --> 00:50:37.708
Don't applaud. he's the villain!

748
00:50:37.791 --> 00:50:40.583
Okay. everyone. listen up.

749
00:50:48.958 --> 00:50:51.125
Okay. everyone listening?

750
00:50:51.208 --> 00:50:53.541
-Speak up!
-Can't hear you!

751
00:50:54.125 --> 00:50:55.208
What?

752
00:50:59.791 --> 00:51:00.833
I'm Rob Stone.

753
00:51:01.416 --> 00:51:04.041
As you know. I've got more talent

754
00:51:04.125 --> 00:51:06.541
than any of you could ever dream
of having.

755
00:51:06.625 --> 00:51:10.083
And I got to admit. it feels good.

756
00:51:10.166 --> 00:51:12.083
-Poor form!
-What she said!

757
00:51:12.166 --> 00:51:13.875
Boo! You stink!

758
00:51:13.958 --> 00:51:17.041
-Now. now. no need to get upset.

759
00:51:17.125 --> 00:51:21.541
I'm going to give you a chance
to win all your talent back.

760
00:51:21.625 --> 00:51:23.083
A game.

761
00:51:23.166 --> 00:51:25.375
On one team. all of you.

762
00:51:25.458 --> 00:51:28.541
On the other team.
me and a couple of slugs.

763
00:51:28.625 --> 00:51:31.583
-You lose. I get all your talent.

764
00:51:32.083 --> 00:51:33.625
And if we win?

765
00:51:34.208 --> 00:51:38.000
Ha! Oh. you definitely will not win.

766
00:51:38.083 --> 00:51:42.208
If we do. you give back
every drop of talent you stole.

767
00:51:42.291 --> 00:51:45.291
Deal! Or. I take all your talent anyway.

768
00:51:45.375 --> 00:51:47.083
-What was that?
-Nothing!

769
00:51:47.666 --> 00:51:49.000
Game time!

770
00:51:49.083 --> 00:51:51.583
Team mutant. assemble!

771
00:52:04.166 --> 00:52:06.541
Gotta get Ponytail off Weird Al.

772
00:52:06.625 --> 00:52:08.375
What about the game?

773
00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:11.458
Yeah. we gotta do that too.
at the same time.

774
00:52:12.208 --> 00:52:15.666
Oh. right.
Good thing it's not something difficult.

775
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:18.291
Let the game begin!

776
00:52:25.791 --> 00:52:27.000
<i>So here we are.</i>

777
00:52:27.083 --> 00:52:30.833
<i>If this was a movie.</i>
<i>this would be the climax at the end.</i>

778
00:52:30.916 --> 00:52:34.333
<i>The crowd is electrified</i>
<i>in anticipation of a battle</i>

779
00:52:34.416 --> 00:52:36.708
<i>that can only be described as.</i>

780
00:52:36.791 --> 00:52:37.958
<i>"What?"</i>

781
00:52:39.666 --> 00:52:41.958
<i>On one side. Zlatan. Megan.</i>

782
00:52:42.041 --> 00:52:44.416
<i>and those scrappy youths</i>
<i>with hearts of gold.</i>

783
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:48.583
<i>On the other. Weird Al</i>
<i>and his army of gelatinous mutants.</i>

784
00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:52.291
<i>Who is going home with the All-Star Cup?</i>
<i>I'm Rob Stone.</i>

785
00:53:19.041 --> 00:53:21.125
<i>These mutant slugs are on the move.</i>

786
00:53:21.208 --> 00:53:22.458
<i>much like </i>Mannequin 2.

787
00:53:22.541 --> 00:53:26.083
-<i>Whoa! Zlatan limbos in for a steal!</i>
-Yeah!

788
00:53:26.166 --> 00:53:28.458
<i>Can the slugs limbo lower now?</i>

789
00:53:28.541 --> 00:53:33.000
<i>Here comes Mutant Weird Al</i>
<i>to show them how it's done mutant-style.</i>

790
00:53:33.875 --> 00:53:35.125
<i>He's going for the goal.</i>

791
00:53:36.666 --> 00:53:37.708
<i>Score!</i>

792
00:53:37.791 --> 00:53:42.291
<i>First goal of the game goes to Weird Al.</i>
<i>Look at that victory dance.</i>

793
00:53:42.375 --> 00:53:46.666
<i>Say what you will about his evil agenda.</i>
<i>the guy can butt bump.</i>

794
00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:54.500
-<i>Score! Another goal!</i>

795
00:53:54.583 --> 00:53:59.458
<i>The lord of the accordion and his</i>
<i>gooey minions are just racking them up.</i>

796
00:53:59.541 --> 00:54:02.166
<i>There's a lot of happy slugs out there.</i>

797
00:54:12.583 --> 00:54:13.916
<i>Goal! Finally.</i>

798
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.416
<i>Zlatan scores and</i>
<i>gets the All-Stars on the board.</i>

799
00:54:18.375 --> 00:54:19.250
Ya!

800
00:54:20.625 --> 00:54:21.458
To me!

801
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:35.041
<i>Weird Al is racking up the points.</i>

802
00:54:35.125 --> 00:54:40.000
<i>Could this be the end of the line for our</i>
<i>scrappy youths and their hearts of gold?</i>

803
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.958
<i>The chips are down. I dropped my bag</i>
<i>of chips. and the All-Stars are losing.</i>

804
00:54:46.041 --> 00:54:47.250
<i>I'm Rob Stone.</i>

805
00:54:47.333 --> 00:54:48.583
<i>-Goal!</i>

806
00:54:50.125 --> 00:54:53.291
<i>Rapinoe is adept</i>
<i>at dodging these monstrosities…</i>

807
00:54:53.375 --> 00:54:55.833
<i>Oh! And the monstrosity steals!</i>

808
00:54:55.916 --> 00:54:59.000
-<i>Rapinoe is not going to stand for that.</i>
-Ew.

809
00:54:59.083 --> 00:55:02.833
<i>Oh. wow.</i>
<i>that's… some grade-A funk right there.</i>

810
00:55:08.166 --> 00:55:11.583
<i>Nautai dancing circles</i>
<i>around these creepy slug things.</i>

811
00:55:11.666 --> 00:55:13.583
<i>-She kicks. she scores!</i>

812
00:55:13.666 --> 00:55:15.416
-Yes! Yes!

813
00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:16.833
<i>We're at 7 to 3.</i>

814
00:55:16.916 --> 00:55:19.541
<i>All-Stars creeping up on the creeps.</i>

815
00:55:19.625 --> 00:55:23.541
<i>Rapinoe to Palio.</i>
<i>Some deft footwork here by All-Star Palio.</i>

816
00:55:23.625 --> 00:55:25.833
<i>He shoots. Palio scores!</i>

817
00:55:25.916 --> 00:55:27.083
<i>-7 to 4.</i>

818
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:32.041
<i>Power block by Zana. Epic save.</i>

819
00:55:32.125 --> 00:55:33.250
<i>Zlatan passes.</i>

820
00:55:33.333 --> 00:55:35.833
<i>O'Dang is off and running. and goal!</i>

821
00:55:35.916 --> 00:55:39.166
<i>-O'Dang kicks it up! We're at 7 to 5.</i>

822
00:55:40.083 --> 00:55:43.458
<i>Fun fact. last week.</i>
<i>these Creature Catchers wrangled</i>

823
00:55:43.541 --> 00:55:46.666
<i>a baker's dozen of possums</i>
<i>from my crawl space.</i>

824
00:55:47.333 --> 00:55:49.416
<i>-Seven to six!</i>

825
00:56:02.666 --> 00:56:03.791
<i>Seven to seven!</i>

826
00:56:03.875 --> 00:56:05.000
Yeah. yeah.

827
00:56:05.083 --> 00:56:06.541
<i>Rapinoe ties it up.</i>

828
00:56:07.666 --> 00:56:10.875
<i>Now. let's see</i>
<i>if the All-Stars can deliver it.</i>

829
00:56:10.958 --> 00:56:14.458
<i>Zlatan's got that look in his eyes.</i>
<i>he's got something to prove.</i>

830
00:56:15.125 --> 00:56:17.000
GASOAT!

831
00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.375
GASOAT.

832
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.333
GASOAT?

833
00:56:21.916 --> 00:56:25.666
<i>It all starts with a ball.</i>
<i>and a person. and their foot.</i>

834
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:29.166
<i>Zlatan gets ready.</i>
<i>gets set. and he shoots…</i>

835
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.500
-Keep it--

836
00:56:52.583 --> 00:56:53.541
Thank you.

837
00:56:54.541 --> 00:56:59.541
<i>And Zlatan scores</i>
<i>just in the nick of time!</i>

838
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:03.375
-<i>The All-Stars win it!</i>

839
00:57:03.458 --> 00:57:04.708
<i>We're done here!</i>

840
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:21.291
-Yes!
-Yay! We won!

841
00:57:21.375 --> 00:57:23.333
-Yes! Yes! Yes!
-Yeah!

842
00:57:23.416 --> 00:57:25.791
No. no. no. no. no!

843
00:57:25.875 --> 00:57:30.291
I wanted to be the All-Star Cup All-Star
of all All-Stars of all-time.

844
00:57:30.375 --> 00:57:34.458
Now I'm just a doctor-mayor-doctor-mutant.

845
00:57:34.541 --> 00:57:38.083
-Oh. that's it!

846
00:57:38.166 --> 00:57:40.625
Hey. watch it. Ponytail. that hurts!

847
00:57:40.708 --> 00:57:43.041
Doesn't hurt as much as losing!

848
00:57:43.125 --> 00:57:47.875
You don't deserve all this talent.
The real thing is always better.

849
00:57:47.958 --> 00:57:49.958
Well. that was fun.

850
00:57:50.041 --> 00:57:52.500
Glad I tried it. but it sure is…

851
00:57:55.208 --> 00:57:57.541
great being back to normal. I--

852
00:57:59.416 --> 00:58:01.875
Hey! Stop deflating me!

853
00:58:03.458 --> 00:58:06.458
Ew. hair in my mouth.

854
00:58:06.541 --> 00:58:09.541
Take that. Weird Al! Still a fan though.

855
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:15.208
You know. I thought I'd never want to
leave the back of Zlatan's head.

856
00:58:15.291 --> 00:58:18.875
Until I got all this talent.

857
00:58:23.916 --> 00:58:24.750
Uh…

858
00:58:41.541 --> 00:58:44.208
I was in the bathroom.
What did--

859
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:48.666
What? Was it something I said?

860
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:51.750
So I look like this now.

861
00:58:57.916 --> 00:59:00.708
-My appetizers!

862
00:59:00.791 --> 00:59:04.125
-Get back here! You too. you two.

863
00:59:04.208 --> 00:59:06.583
Where do you think you're going?

864
00:59:10.875 --> 00:59:13.833
Runaway slugs! Don't mind if I do!

865
00:59:17.375 --> 00:59:18.708
Good slugs!

866
00:59:18.791 --> 00:59:21.583
Now for an All-Star main course!

867
00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:24.458
Whoop!

868
00:59:28.458 --> 00:59:30.291
Stop right there!

869
00:59:31.875 --> 00:59:34.541
It appears as though I've had a change of…

870
00:59:34.625 --> 00:59:35.625
-…fart.

871
00:59:35.708 --> 00:59:37.166
Phew!

872
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:40.625
Yes. I stole people's talent
using advanced genetics.

873
00:59:40.708 --> 00:59:44.625
but I've seen the error
of my brilliantly evil ways.

874
00:59:44.708 --> 00:59:45.583
And now

875
00:59:46.458 --> 00:59:49.583
it's time for a little redemption.
Weird Al-style.

876
00:59:49.666 --> 00:59:51.541
Hello. Ponytail.

877
00:59:51.625 --> 00:59:54.250
-It's me. Doctor-Mayor-Doctor Weird Al.

878
00:59:54.333 --> 00:59:56.833
Or as you might know me. Mama.

879
00:59:56.916 --> 01:00:00.208
-I believe we can both be reasonable here.
-Mama.

880
01:00:02.583 --> 01:00:06.625
So that's what I raised?
A ponytail who eats his own mother?

881
01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:09.333
Fine. I hope I taste terrible.

882
01:00:09.416 --> 01:00:11.875
Nope. Just weird.

883
01:00:11.958 --> 01:00:13.041
See what I did there?

884
01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:17.541
Talking with your mouth full?
Who raised you?

885
01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:19.750
Oh. guess it was me.

886
01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:24.291
More nuanced and complex
than I initially realized.

887
01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:27.708
Anyway. who wants to get eaten next?

888
01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.000
You want to eat them?

889
01:00:30.083 --> 01:00:34.166
You start right here with Zlatan.

890
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:35.375
Zlatan!

891
01:00:35.458 --> 01:00:37.500
I'll give you one last chance.

892
01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:38.875
Take me back.

893
01:00:38.958 --> 01:00:40.958
Well. I'm kind of seeing someone.

894
01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:44.375
No. I meant reattach me to your head.

895
01:00:44.458 --> 01:00:48.333
I came to life
from just one drop of your talent.

896
01:00:48.416 --> 01:00:52.958
Imagine what we could do with
every drop of every All-Star's talent.

897
01:00:53.041 --> 01:00:56.583
And now also Weird Al's talent.

898
01:01:03.291 --> 01:01:07.708
Come on. Zlatan. Together.
we can be the greatest of all time.

899
01:01:07.791 --> 01:01:10.500
G-O-A-T. GOAT!

900
01:01:11.416 --> 01:01:13.791
No goats. just Zlatan.

901
01:01:13.875 --> 01:01:15.416
Be both!

902
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.750
Just reattach me.

903
01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:20.000
Talent is in here
waiting for you to soak it up.

904
01:01:20.083 --> 01:01:21.125
Come on.

905
01:01:21.208 --> 01:01:26.000
Just think.
we'll be the ultimate All-Star.

906
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:30.083
Zlatan already is the ultimate All-Star!

907
01:01:30.166 --> 01:01:32.250
Oh. maybe out here.

908
01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:34.708
But let's see how ultimate you are

909
01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:37.625
inside my guts!

910
01:01:47.291 --> 01:01:49.333
Puke him up. Ponytail!

911
01:01:49.416 --> 01:01:51.583
Oh. I don't think so!

912
01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:54.958
In fact. I still have room for more!

913
01:01:55.041 --> 01:01:59.125
I'm so hungry I could eat
David Beckham's talent.

914
01:02:00.166 --> 01:02:02.791
Hey! Hey. what are you weirdos doing?

915
01:02:09.083 --> 01:02:10.666
Curse you. Rapinoe!

916
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:11.791
Let's go!

917
01:02:34.833 --> 01:02:35.833
Ow!

918
01:02:41.583 --> 01:02:43.500
Zlatan!

919
01:03:07.166 --> 01:03:08.791
Yes!

920
01:03:08.875 --> 01:03:11.791
-Zlatan! Zlatan! Zlatan!
-Yes. yes. yes!

921
01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:13.791
-Zlatan. yes!
-Woo-hoo!

922
01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:16.666
Wait! What about Weird Al?

923
01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:18.750
Guess he didn't make it.

924
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:28.458
Take that. green glowing slug of death.
I escaped!

925
01:03:29.916 --> 01:03:32.583
Through a hole Zlatan kicked in his belly?

926
01:03:32.666 --> 01:03:34.916
Hole? In its belly?

927
01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:36.791
Wonderful!

928
01:03:36.875 --> 01:03:39.583
No.
I didn't know about the belly hole.

929
01:03:39.666 --> 01:03:43.208
This. uh. is the first time
I'm hearing about that. Hmm.

930
01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:45.666
-Does anyone have a mint?

931
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:48.833
Here you go.
Doctor-Mayor-Doctor-Mister Al.

932
01:03:48.916 --> 01:03:51.166
Please. we're friends now.

933
01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:53.750
Just call me Doctor-Mayor-Doctor Weird.

934
01:03:54.708 --> 01:03:56.208
Okay. see… Hmm.

935
01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:58.333
Oh. Yeah.

936
01:03:58.416 --> 01:04:00.791
-Ah.
-You know what? Here. They're yours.

937
01:04:00.875 --> 01:04:02.291
Oh no. I couldn't.

938
01:04:02.375 --> 01:04:05.291
Please. save me the trouble
of throwing them in the trash.

939
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:08.958
Wow. that was impressive.

940
01:04:09.041 --> 01:04:11.291
You played one monster of a game.

941
01:04:11.375 --> 01:04:13.458
The All-Stars win it.

942
01:04:13.541 --> 01:04:16.541
I'm Rob Stone. and that is game.

943
01:04:16.625 --> 01:04:19.666
For all creature-catching needs.
be sure to call…

944
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:21.375
Creature Catchers!

945
01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:24.250
Creature Catchers rule! Woo-hoo!

946
01:04:32.166 --> 01:04:33.291
Pass it to me!

947
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Over here!

948
01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:41.500
Yes!

949
01:04:42.291 --> 01:04:44.500
-Selfie. selfie. selfie!

950
01:04:45.958 --> 01:04:47.000
I got this.

951
01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:49.791
All right!

952
01:04:57.958 --> 01:04:58.916
Whoa.

953
01:05:14.291 --> 01:05:16.000
Keep it down--

954
01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:20.958
Sequel time.

955
01:05:30.583 --> 01:05:34.000
Hello. I am Zlatan. as if you didn't know.

956
01:05:35.041 --> 01:05:38.541
Uh. Netflix asked me
to reassure younger viewers

957
01:05:38.625 --> 01:05:41.166
who are concerned for Zlatan's safety.

958
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:43.125
This is just a silly story.

959
01:05:43.208 --> 01:05:44.916
Zlatan is perfectly safe.

960
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.375
-See. no slug on my ponytail.

961
01:05:48.458 --> 01:05:50.958
Slug on my ponytail! Get it off!

962
01:05:53.375 --> 01:05:55.375
It's real! So real!
