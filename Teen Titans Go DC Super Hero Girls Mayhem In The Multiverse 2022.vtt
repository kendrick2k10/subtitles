3
00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:23.164
Oh. mans. It's glorious!

4
00:01:23.248 --> 00:01:25.792
Watching TV will never be the same.

5
00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:29.254
Can you believe someone was just
throwing this beauty away?

6
00:01:29.337 --> 00:01:31.798
I mean this baby's got it all!

7
00:01:32.215 --> 00:01:34.634
That pristine wood foam laminate.

8
00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:37.804
Brackets for CDs. DVDs. cassettes.

9
00:01:37.888 --> 00:01:40.015
all kinds of obsolete physical media.

10
00:01:41.057 --> 00:01:43.226
A family of marmots
living in a stereo drawer.

11
00:01:44.227 --> 00:01:47.689
And do not forget the shelving
for all of our many books.

12
00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:55.071
Ain't no thang.

13
00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:57.157
We just got to find something
to wedge under its.

14
00:01:58.575 --> 00:02:00.827
Hmm. Hmm.

15
00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:08.919
Think harder. genius.

16
00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.301
Yo. this little squidgy will do.

17
00:02:18.678 --> 00:02:20.889
Nice work! Now to see what's on.

18
00:02:20.972 --> 00:02:23.558
Hello. Titans!

19
00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:24.893
Control Freak?

20
00:02:24.976 --> 00:02:27.270
What madness
do you have in store this time?

21
00:02:27.354 --> 00:02:29.147
You gonna turn us into claymation?

22
00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:30.524
Make us hawk food processors

23
00:02:30.607 --> 00:02:32.859
in some tacky three-camera infomercial?

24
00:02:32.943 --> 00:02:34.819
Twist us into
a gritty live-action series

25
00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:36.613
targeted at adult audiences?

26
00:02:36.696 --> 00:02:39.741
That's been done. So gritty.

27
00:02:39.824 --> 00:02:43.370
Oh. weren't you clods paying attention
to the opening credits?

28
00:02:43.453 --> 00:02:45.693
In our defense. we were getting
this thing up the stairs.

29
00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:47.791
This is your...

30
00:02:47.874 --> 00:02:50.919
Super Hero Team Crossover Event!

31
00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.839
You mean like another movie?

32
00:02:54.923 --> 00:02:56.424
Uh. did I say. movie?

33
00:02:56.508 --> 00:02:59.844
Not a crossover.
That's when a lame show

34
00:02:59.928 --> 00:03:03.348
tries to glom onto a cooler one in order
to boost their popularity.

35
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.562
- Oh. no! Are we's being canceled?
- One can only hope.

36
00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:10.147
Everyone knows a good crossover
has to have

37
00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.859
some epic threat that brings the heroes
from two worlds together.

38
00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:15.611
And epic threats just aren't our thing.

39
00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:19.824
Who said this was
a good crossover. huh?

40
00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.244
He means business. Titans.

41
00:03:23.327 --> 00:03:24.912
We'd better play along.

42
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.167
Robin. please. what are you doing?

43
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.752
In superhero crossovers.

44
00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:34.088
each team is introduced
in an action set piece.

45
00:03:34.171 --> 00:03:36.632
you know. to remind the audience
how awesome the heroes are

46
00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.593
even before they meet
their counterparts.

47
00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:41.796
Quick. everybody. do something action-y.
before they cut away to the other h...

48
00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:46.809
The superhero girls?

49
00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.645
But our plan for this heist
was purr-fect.

50
00:03:57.695 --> 00:03:59.697
Oh. oh. sorry. Mittens.

51
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.533
No matter how "purr-fect" your plan is.

52
00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:05.494
our captain is always
gonna have a perfecter one.

53
00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.830
I'm flattered. But it is a team effort.

54
00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:13.044
Peek-a-boo!

55
00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:15.004
I whomp you!

56
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.506
- Zatanna!
- I got her!

57
00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:23.304
That's my friend. Harleen.

58
00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:26.682
Oh. you care about
your friends now. Babs?

59
00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.809
I do. when they're not supervillains.

60
00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.811
Oh. don't be so dramatic.

61
00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.104
Zee. are you okay?

62
00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:37.652
Wha... Oh. yeah. Totally.

63
00:04:37.818 --> 00:04:38.818
How are you?

64
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.409
One of these days. we're going to crush
you jerks! And...

65
00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:46.702
Wait. What's this?

66
00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:50.122
Ah. who cares what it is.
It's bustin' us free!

67
00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:52.166
So long. clowns!

68
00:04:57.171 --> 00:05:00.049
Let me guess.
Creepy purple cloud got 'em?

69
00:05:00.132 --> 00:05:01.884
Exactly. How did you know?

70
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.388
Same thing happened to me last week
when I took Solomon Grundy down.

71
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.139
And when I was pounding on the Riddler.

72
00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.810
Yesterday. I stopped
both Toyman and Cheetah.

73
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.437
- Each time...
- gone.

74
00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:19.528
Uh... Oh. nothing happened
to the bad guys I caught this week.

75
00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.614
Of course. I didn't catch any bad guys.

76
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.826
but I did help my neighbor
find his lost cat.

77
00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:29.079
Sounds like we have a mystery to solve.

78
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:33.333
Babs. I think what you meant to say
is. "we" have a mystery to solve.

79
00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:35.252
Boys. there's no need to compete.

80
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.838
Now! Go!

81
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.506
We'll let you know

82
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.508
where the bad guys went
after we find 'em!

83
00:05:44.303 --> 00:05:45.929
I know what
you're asking yourselves.

84
00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:47.848
What would a multi-billionaire like me

85
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.267
want with such an eclectic group of...

86
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.810
you?

87
00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:55.188
This Hall of Doom
must've cost you a mint.

88
00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:58.358
You think you could afford a decent
hand-dryer in the ladies room?

89
00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:02.446
Ew. real fur?

90
00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.615
What are you. like. an actual cat?

91
00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.910
Hey. Selina. eat your heart out.

92
00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:12.706
What if I told you I hold the power
to get rid of every superhero?

93
00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.920
While searching through
the remains of Krypton.

94
00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:21.840
my space probe came across
The Amulet of Cythonna.

95
00:06:21.924 --> 00:06:26.053
This device uses an ancient science
even I have yet to understand.

96
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:29.431
But its power is undeniable.

97
00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:32.768
Power? Luthor no find trinket in space.

98
00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:35.729
Luthor find trinket in cereal box.

99
00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:43.570
If it weren't for this. Chuckles.
you'd be in jail now.

100
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.989
But if you are still not convinced...

101
00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:54.206
- Uh. where'd he go?
- They call it the Phantom Zone.

102
00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.834
But you can think of it as our own
personal superhero dumping ground.

103
00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:05.300
If you have that.
why do you need us?

104
00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:09.596
Someone's gotta lure all those heroes
into our little trap.

105
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.516
These are the spots
the mist was seen.

106
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.102
Hmm. I don't see a pattern.

107
00:07:14.185 --> 00:07:16.372
But if you squint just right.
it kind of looks like a puppy.

108
00:07:16.396 --> 00:07:18.356
Come on. Babs. We have to ke...

109
00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:20.733
- Aw...
- Guys. check this out.

110
00:07:21.317 --> 00:07:23.069
See something in your armor-cam video?

111
00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:25.029
Not see. hear.

112
00:07:25.738 --> 00:07:29.158
- Just listen.
<i>- Cythonna.</i>

113
00:07:29.242 --> 00:07:31.911
Uh. is it saying. cellphones?

114
00:07:31.995 --> 00:07:36.958
- Sounds more like "syphon oats."
- She's saying Cythonna.

115
00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:39.460
But that's impossible.

116
00:07:39.544 --> 00:07:40.962
What is Cythonna?

117
00:07:41.254 --> 00:07:43.131
Well. not what. Who.

118
00:07:43.506 --> 00:07:47.260
I mean. even a planet of science dorks
like Krypton had its mythology.

119
00:07:47.343 --> 00:07:51.514
and Cythonna was the goddess
of darkness. blight. and suffering.

120
00:07:51.598 --> 00:07:53.933
Yeesh. Bet she was a blast at parties.

121
00:07:54.017 --> 00:07:57.061
Story goes. she ran the show
on Krypton for centuries.

122
00:07:57.145 --> 00:08:00.690
<i>which was pretty much a hot heap
of stink for all concerned.</i>

123
00:08:00.773 --> 00:08:04.694
<i>until. one day. her kid brother. Rao.
god of sun and other stuff.</i>

124
00:08:04.777 --> 00:08:08.406
<i>trapped her in an amulet
and chucked her into space.</i>

125
00:08:08.907 --> 00:08:11.743
So while kids here are told to wish upon
a shooting star.

126
00:08:11.826 --> 00:08:17.248
we were told to behave. it could be
Cythonna coming to get you.

127
00:08:17.332 --> 00:08:19.292
And did you believe that?

128
00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:21.628
What? No! No. I'm from Krypton.

129
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:26.382
No one believed in ancient
yet terrifying myths like that.

130
00:08:26.466 --> 00:08:29.052
So. yeah. let's just talk about
something else. all right?

131
00:08:29.135 --> 00:08:31.262
Did I hear there's a map
that looks like a puppy?

132
00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:37.977
'Sup nerds? Mind if we play?

133
00:08:46.194 --> 00:08:49.364
Hey. Giganta! You're not gonna
disappear this time.

134
00:08:49.447 --> 00:08:52.367
Oh. we ain't disappearing. You are!

135
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.786
Huh?

136
00:08:56.079 --> 00:08:58.248
That's what happens to any superhero

137
00:08:58.331 --> 00:09:01.709
dumb enough to face the Legion of Doom!

138
00:09:12.762 --> 00:09:13.763
Ooh.

139
00:09:27.528 --> 00:09:28.529
Hmph!

140
00:09:38.414 --> 00:09:41.792
Oh. no!

141
00:09:42.376 --> 00:09:45.629
Oh. this is terrible!

142
00:09:45.713 --> 00:09:48.632
- Chin up. Garth. We're not done yet.
- No!

143
00:09:48.716 --> 00:09:51.719
Mr. Goodberry's cat got out again!

144
00:09:56.932 --> 00:10:01.353
Hey. half-pint. you calling to say you
guys give up looking for the bad guys?

145
00:10:01.437 --> 00:10:04.148
<i>No. we found them.
and it's not great.</i>

146
00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:07.776
Wait. Garth. are you okay? Talk to me.

147
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.739
They've teamed up. and we think they got
Ollie. Hal. and Barry too.

148
00:10:11.822 --> 00:10:15.534
They call themselves the Legacy of Doom!

149
00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:17.578
<i>It's the Legion of Doom. Garth.</i>

150
00:10:17.786 --> 00:10:18.913
<i>Really?</i>

151
00:10:18.996 --> 00:10:20.831
<i>I could swear Livewire said...</i>

152
00:10:20.915 --> 00:10:23.626
Guys. prioritize details. Where are you?

153
00:10:23.709 --> 00:10:25.252
The park! Hurry!

154
00:10:25.336 --> 00:10:28.172
I can't... hold...

155
00:10:30.341 --> 00:10:33.219
Team. to the park.

156
00:10:55.032 --> 00:10:57.660
Any sign of them? Oh. no.

157
00:10:59.328 --> 00:11:00.871
Hawkman's mace.

158
00:11:01.247 --> 00:11:03.749
- You don't think...
- Hey. what's that?

159
00:11:10.339 --> 00:11:13.342
It looks Kryptonian.
or maybe ancient Kryptonian.

160
00:11:13.425 --> 00:11:14.885
because I can only make out

161
00:11:14.969 --> 00:11:16.679
a few of the... the words.

162
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:19.391
Oh. Oh. that's not good.

163
00:11:19.474 --> 00:11:20.850
What? What does it say?

164
00:11:20.934 --> 00:11:23.687
I think this thing sent our friends
to the Phantom Zone.

165
00:11:24.104 --> 00:11:25.939
You mean that creepy limbo dimension?

166
00:11:26.314 --> 00:11:28.608
But we saw what it took
to open a portal.

167
00:11:28.692 --> 00:11:29.818
How can one little ball...

168
00:11:29.901 --> 00:11:32.445
Cythonna. I'm not sure
what the rest of this says.

169
00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:35.490
but I know this says Cythonna.

170
00:11:37.117 --> 00:11:38.535
Clearly. whatever we're up against

171
00:11:38.618 --> 00:11:41.496
is far more formidable
than we anticipated.

172
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.747
We will need a plan.

173
00:11:42.831 --> 00:11:44.291
How's this for a plan?

174
00:11:44.374 --> 00:11:47.210
Find the jerks who are using stuff
from my dead homeworld

175
00:11:47.294 --> 00:11:51.214
to hurt our friends and.
formidable or not. take 'em down.

176
00:11:51.298 --> 00:11:53.633
But how do we find this Legion of Doom?

177
00:11:53.717 --> 00:11:56.970
BT dubs. very cool name.
Makes you wish

178
00:11:57.053 --> 00:11:59.306
we put a little more effort
into Super Hero Girls.

179
00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:02.434
I got a hunch this little guy
might be our biggest clue.

180
00:12:03.977 --> 00:12:06.021
Kara. where are you going?

181
00:12:06.104 --> 00:12:07.856
To see a translator.

182
00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:11.943
Legion of Doom? That's rich.

183
00:12:12.027 --> 00:12:14.321
Quit it. I think they used
Kryptonian magic

184
00:12:14.404 --> 00:12:16.364
to send my friends to the Phantom Zone.

185
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.825
See. this says Cythonna.

186
00:12:19.701 --> 00:12:22.245
Your Kryptonian is awful.

187
00:12:22.329 --> 00:12:23.788
This doesn't say Cythonna.

188
00:12:23.872 --> 00:12:28.168
And even if it did. hello. there's no
such thing as Kryptonian magic.

189
00:12:28.251 --> 00:12:32.297
- Cythonna is a fairy tale.
- You think this is a joke?

190
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:36.343
I'm sure your buddies are probably
just off goofing around somewhere.

191
00:12:36.426 --> 00:12:38.094
"Goofing around"?

192
00:12:38.178 --> 00:12:40.364
Remember when you couldn't
find that one kid for two days

193
00:12:40.388 --> 00:12:42.224
because he locked himself
in a port-a-pooper?

194
00:12:42.307 --> 00:12:44.351
Garth was only locked inside one day.

195
00:12:44.434 --> 00:12:46.394
He spent the second day in the shower.

196
00:12:46.478 --> 00:12:49.689
Look. Kara. This has been fun.
But if I thought for a second

197
00:12:49.773 --> 00:12:52.108
your pals were in danger
or someone got a hold

198
00:12:52.192 --> 00:12:55.695
of a Kryptonian weapon.
believe me. I'd be all over it.

199
00:12:57.197 --> 00:12:58.198
Hmph!

200
00:12:59.616 --> 00:13:01.409
She knows about the Phantom Zone.

201
00:13:08.208 --> 00:13:09.501
Still no guesses?

202
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.960
I'll give you a hint.

203
00:13:11.336 --> 00:13:13.755
It's not bigger than a breadbox.

204
00:13:15.549 --> 00:13:16.591
Anyone?

205
00:13:17.717 --> 00:13:19.636
Okay. One more hint.

206
00:13:19.928 --> 00:13:23.432
It's not smaller than a breadbox either.

207
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:26.561
Hal. I ran an hour out
in all directions.

208
00:13:26.644 --> 00:13:27.645
Nothing?

209
00:13:27.937 --> 00:13:31.232
Argh! And my ring still can't seem
to penetrate this darkness.

210
00:13:31.315 --> 00:13:32.315
I hate to say this.

211
00:13:32.817 --> 00:13:35.945
- We're stuck here.
- Give up?

212
00:13:36.612 --> 00:13:39.907
It is a breadbox! Gotcha!

213
00:13:49.083 --> 00:13:50.918
I failed.

214
00:13:51.002 --> 00:13:54.005
- I am sorry. Mother.
- Sorry?

215
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.341
"Sorry" will not shield you
from a vengeful enemy.

216
00:13:57.425 --> 00:14:00.303
Nor will it shield those who follow you.

217
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.460
Worried about the Legion of Doom?

218
00:14:06.434 --> 00:14:09.228
Why? Are you concerned
a miscalculation in my leadership

219
00:14:09.312 --> 00:14:11.439
against this unknown evil
may bring you harm?

220
00:14:11.522 --> 00:14:15.234
Do you not realize I love you all
too much to allow that to happen?

221
00:14:15.318 --> 00:14:17.069
Zeus as my witness.
Barbara Gordon.

222
00:14:17.153 --> 00:14:18.821
that will not happen!

223
00:14:18.905 --> 00:14:20.990
Uh. thanks. D. I love you too.

224
00:14:21.657 --> 00:14:25.870
No. I was actually thinking about
the Legion because of Harleen.

225
00:14:26.245 --> 00:14:29.040
I thought. since we found out
each other's secret. she'd.

226
00:14:29.123 --> 00:14:31.125
- you know...
- Change her ways.

227
00:14:31.417 --> 00:14:33.961
I know Harleen. Diana. She's not evil.

228
00:14:34.337 --> 00:14:37.340
It is heartbreaking. but you do realize
that. for months.

229
00:14:37.423 --> 00:14:40.218
Harley Quinn has held a supervillain's
deadliest weapon.

230
00:14:40.301 --> 00:14:42.345
A heat-seeking poison-tipped scimitar?

231
00:14:42.428 --> 00:14:44.388
Your secret identity.

232
00:14:44.472 --> 00:14:47.683
She knows who you are. and yet.
has done nothing about it.

233
00:14:48.684 --> 00:14:51.854
You're right. So. I guess there is hope.

234
00:14:55.107 --> 00:14:57.401
Well. Super-jerk blew me off.

235
00:14:57.944 --> 00:14:59.237
They still don't know.

236
00:14:59.987 --> 00:15:02.073
He would not help translate that sphere?

237
00:15:02.156 --> 00:15:04.992
Hmm. If only we had an ancient
Kryptonian-to-English dictionary

238
00:15:05.076 --> 00:15:06.452
lying around. huh?

239
00:15:06.911 --> 00:15:11.082
Actually. I know where we could find
something way better than a dictionary.

240
00:15:13.626 --> 00:15:16.170
My heat spell
maybe keeping me warm.

241
00:15:16.254 --> 00:15:19.257
but this drastic climate change
is going to be murder on my hair.

242
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.759
Okay. Zee.
Don't worry. Not much farther.

243
00:15:21.842 --> 00:15:24.512
- Not much farther to what?
- That!

244
00:15:40.863 --> 00:15:43.991
- Are you sure it's okay we're here?
- Totally not. No.

245
00:15:44.074 --> 00:15:46.410
That's why he calls it
his Fortress of Solitude.

246
00:15:46.493 --> 00:15:48.036
and not. I don't know. a...

247
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.788
The Buddy Bunker?
Friendship Depot?

248
00:15:49.872 --> 00:15:51.707
Ooh. Kal-El's House of ha-has.

249
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.250
Stop right there.

250
00:15:56.503 --> 00:15:58.839
Oh. we're in so much trouble.

251
00:15:58.922 --> 00:16:00.382
Stop right there.

252
00:16:02.593 --> 00:16:04.469
Stop right there.

253
00:16:04.553 --> 00:16:06.305
Stop right there.

254
00:16:07.681 --> 00:16:11.768
Kara. how many last sons
did Krypton actually have?

255
00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:14.438
Relax. these are
just his dumb robot guards.

256
00:16:14.521 --> 00:16:16.231
Hey. they're tall. tan. and gruesome.

257
00:16:16.315 --> 00:16:18.942
It's cousin Kara. I... Ow!

258
00:16:19.234 --> 00:16:21.987
Huh? This one must have
a loose circuit or something.

259
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.822
Just gonna take a quick look-see.

260
00:16:27.159 --> 00:16:30.954
Okay. Which one of you
glorified coffee makers is next?

261
00:17:00.817 --> 00:17:02.736
Ha-ha.

262
00:17:07.699 --> 00:17:09.910
Hmph! Gotta say. not impressed.

263
00:17:09.993 --> 00:17:12.746
- Where is Supergirl?
- She's over here. gang.

264
00:17:13.497 --> 00:17:15.666
Good news. she got what we came for.

265
00:17:15.749 --> 00:17:18.168
Ta-daa! Told you we'd be in and out.

266
00:17:18.252 --> 00:17:20.587
You sure did. In fact. you can say

267
00:17:20.671 --> 00:17:23.507
you were a-head of the game.

268
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:26.593
Oh. you're so funny.
Oh. you're so funny.

269
00:17:26.718 --> 00:17:28.387
Guys. guys. I'm doing a...

270
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:29.471
talking as both of us...

271
00:17:36.896 --> 00:17:38.898
So. Kara. what's in that case. anyway?

272
00:17:39.315 --> 00:17:42.527
This is Krypton's
entire wealth of knowledge.

273
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.071
It'll give us the true poop
on Cythonna and her amulet.

274
00:17:45.655 --> 00:17:46.573
Wow.

275
00:17:46.656 --> 00:17:50.243
A complete culture stored
in just a handful of crystals.

276
00:17:50.326 --> 00:17:53.830
Oh. yeah.
Kryptonians loved their crystals.

277
00:17:53.955 --> 00:17:56.040
These babies hold all kinds of things.

278
00:17:58.751 --> 00:17:59.751
Funny.

279
00:18:00.253 --> 00:18:01.796
I don't recall inviting guests.

280
00:18:02.547 --> 00:18:05.466
Another robot? I got this one.

281
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:06.550
Batgirl. wait!

282
00:18:07.635 --> 00:18:09.012
Ow!

283
00:18:09.095 --> 00:18:10.263
Ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow!

284
00:18:10.346 --> 00:18:12.026
He's real. he's real.
he's real. he's real!

285
00:18:13.016 --> 00:18:14.851
Put the crystals back. Kara.

286
00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.813
No way. Listen. Clark. I know
you don't believe me.

287
00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:20.899
but there is a huge threat.

288
00:18:21.524 --> 00:18:24.152
- I do believe you.
- Don't interrupt me!

289
00:18:24.235 --> 00:18:26.446
- Wait. Wha...
- You're right.

290
00:18:26.529 --> 00:18:29.657
In fact. I already knew Lex Luthor
is behind the Legion of Doom.

291
00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:31.719
and that they're sending heroes
to the Phantom Zone

292
00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:34.913
- using a Kryptonian device.
- The Amulet of Cythonna.

293
00:18:34.996 --> 00:18:38.833
Wait. so. if you knew all of this.
why did you blow me off at your place?

294
00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:41.669
Because I also knew
you're out of your league.

295
00:18:41.753 --> 00:18:43.963
Luthor is not to be trifled with.

296
00:18:44.047 --> 00:18:45.840
We've taken him down before.

297
00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:48.384
Not with a deadly weapon
like this. you haven't.

298
00:18:48.468 --> 00:18:51.346
I know Luthor. This time.
he's playing for keeps.

299
00:18:51.429 --> 00:18:52.722
What are you saying?

300
00:18:52.805 --> 00:18:54.182
What kind of hero would I be

301
00:18:54.265 --> 00:18:56.145
if I let a bunch of kids
walk off to their doom?

302
00:18:57.852 --> 00:18:59.395
Thanks. Dad.

303
00:18:59.479 --> 00:19:01.689
You think you could stop us on your own?

304
00:19:02.482 --> 00:19:05.318
Yeah. I do. But even if I couldn't...

305
00:19:21.417 --> 00:19:22.961
the Justice League could.

306
00:19:23.628 --> 00:19:26.923
The Justice League?
Another cool name!

307
00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.634
Yeah. I wanted to call ourselves
the Super Friends. man.

308
00:19:29.717 --> 00:19:31.094
But I got out-voted.

309
00:19:31.177 --> 00:19:32.805
So unfair.

310
00:19:33.264 --> 00:19:36.809
I mean. we appreciate
the concern. gentlemen.

311
00:19:36.892 --> 00:19:39.311
but we are more than capable
of handling ourselves.

312
00:19:40.229 --> 00:19:42.189
Yeah. Jon. you helped train me on Oa.

313
00:19:42.273 --> 00:19:43.857
I was the top of my class.

314
00:19:43.941 --> 00:19:46.151
Sorry. rookie.
Pacifism won't cut it this time.

315
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:47.810
Punches have got to be thrown.

316
00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:50.197
This is just dumb.

317
00:19:50.781 --> 00:19:51.949
Batman. buddy.

318
00:19:52.032 --> 00:19:54.118
Tell these guys how we saved Gotham.

319
00:19:54.827 --> 00:19:55.911
Not this time.

320
00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.830
What do you mean. not this time.

321
00:19:58.706 --> 00:20:00.291
The league already has a plan.

322
00:20:00.416 --> 00:20:02.167
Frankly. you'd only be
getting in the way.

323
00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:04.378
Our friends are the ones in trouble.

324
00:20:04.712 --> 00:20:09.008
So. if we're in your way.
go ahead and move us.

325
00:20:22.646 --> 00:20:24.940
Diamagnetic repulsor. So cool.

326
00:20:29.236 --> 00:20:30.571
I may not be swinging fists.

327
00:20:30.654 --> 00:20:32.948
but I have no problem
restraining you in one.

328
00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:34.532
I'm gonna disagree.

329
00:20:34.617 --> 00:20:36.493
and say you have a pretty big problem.

330
00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:41.290
So. uh.

331
00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:42.583
shouldn't we be fighting?

332
00:20:42.666 --> 00:20:44.266
Feel like we're just kinda
standing here.

333
00:20:44.627 --> 00:20:46.253
Oh. I don't care.

334
00:20:46.503 --> 00:20:47.504
I'm up for whatever.

335
00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:48.713
What do you feel like?

336
00:20:51.884 --> 00:20:53.052
Kara. stay down.

337
00:20:53.469 --> 00:20:55.221
Can't you see
I'm trying to protect you?

338
00:20:56.847 --> 00:20:59.099
Do we look like we need protecting?

339
00:21:06.482 --> 00:21:07.483
Enough!

340
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:13.030
Woohoo. you guys are in trouble now.

341
00:21:13.614 --> 00:21:14.448
Superman.

342
00:21:14.532 --> 00:21:15.616
you say you have a plan

343
00:21:15.699 --> 00:21:17.868
stop the Legion of Doom
and free our friends?

344
00:21:18.035 --> 00:21:19.036
Yes.

345
00:21:19.119 --> 00:21:20.371
What about Cythonna?

346
00:21:20.704 --> 00:21:22.498
There is no Cythonna. Kara.

347
00:21:22.873 --> 00:21:25.042
The ancient science
that amulet uses may be deadly.

348
00:21:25.292 --> 00:21:26.460
But it's just another weapon.

349
00:21:26.794 --> 00:21:29.088
Once it's out of the wrong
hands. it's harmless.

350
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:30.923
And you are confident in your plan?

351
00:21:31.006 --> 00:21:32.006
What do you think?

352
00:21:39.432 --> 00:21:41.226
We shall defer to the Justice League.

353
00:21:48.984 --> 00:21:50.443
Are you kidding me?

354
00:21:56.032 --> 00:21:57.659
Ooh! I can't wait till those.

355
00:21:57.742 --> 00:21:59.452
Super Hero Girls show their faces.

356
00:21:59.661 --> 00:22:02.998
And we send them to limbo for eternity.

357
00:22:06.418 --> 00:22:08.545
Yeah. but since it's eternity.

358
00:22:08.628 --> 00:22:09.628
we got time.

359
00:22:09.671 --> 00:22:11.464
I mean. it's not like
we have to send them

360
00:22:11.548 --> 00:22:12.841
to limbo today.

361
00:22:20.849 --> 00:22:22.726
You must be so proud.

362
00:22:23.101 --> 00:22:24.603
As their confidence grows.

363
00:22:24.686 --> 00:22:26.229
so does their malevolence.

364
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.982
Have you forgotten. Cythonna?

365
00:22:29.441 --> 00:22:31.443
You are a silent partner.

366
00:22:32.444 --> 00:22:35.947
Of course not. I appear to only you.
in this astral form.

367
00:22:37.282 --> 00:22:38.450
Albeit. weakly.

368
00:22:38.742 --> 00:22:40.660
for. as you know.

369
00:22:40.744 --> 00:22:42.287
my powers are limited

370
00:22:42.495 --> 00:22:43.747
while I remain trapped

371
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:47.042
within this cursed prison forever.

372
00:22:47.542 --> 00:22:48.542
It's not all bad.

373
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:49.586
Possessing your prison

374
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:51.755
grants me access to that limited power.

375
00:22:51.838 --> 00:22:52.923
In return.

376
00:22:53.173 --> 00:22:54.216
I only ask...

377
00:22:54.299 --> 00:22:55.467
Oh. I know what you want.

378
00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.385
And perhaps once I.
Lex Luther. am victorious.

379
00:22:57.469 --> 00:22:58.595
I will indulge you.

380
00:22:59.596 --> 00:23:00.597
If I'm in a good mood.

381
00:23:01.181 --> 00:23:04.309
You haven't begun to know what I want.

382
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.606
<i>We're gonna defer to the league?</i>

383
00:23:09.689 --> 00:23:10.774
Okay. I'll admit.

384
00:23:10.857 --> 00:23:12.275
I don't know what defer means.

385
00:23:12.484 --> 00:23:13.794
but I'm pretty sure you told him.

386
00:23:13.818 --> 00:23:15.028
we just roll over.

387
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.490
Since when do we back down from a fight?

388
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.867
- Are you afraid...
- I am an Amazon!

389
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:22.494
I fear no fight.

390
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:24.955
Kara.

391
00:23:25.038 --> 00:23:27.832
your will is the strongest
of any warrior I have known.

392
00:23:27.999 --> 00:23:30.168
And while that is part
of what makes you so mighty.

393
00:23:30.252 --> 00:23:32.003
it can also make you vulnerable

394
00:23:32.087 --> 00:23:33.797
when you allow it to become
bullheadedness.

395
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.715
This brings me no pleasure either.

396
00:23:36.174 --> 00:23:37.759
But you chose me as your leader.

397
00:23:37.842 --> 00:23:39.386
not to make popular decisions.

398
00:23:39.469 --> 00:23:40.513
But the tough ones.

399
00:23:40.596 --> 00:23:42.765
And what if the League
blows it? Then what. huh?

400
00:23:42.848 --> 00:23:45.851
We left our only clue to stopping
anything at the North Pole.

401
00:23:54.402 --> 00:23:55.402
Ugh.

402
00:23:57.238 --> 00:23:58.072
Say. Kara.

403
00:23:58.155 --> 00:24:00.992
what was that about leaving
our only clue at the North Pole?

404
00:24:01.075 --> 00:24:04.078
You swiped my cousin's data crystals.

405
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.169
Bet your friends
are mad at you. huh?

406
00:24:13.212 --> 00:24:14.338
Superman?

407
00:24:14.422 --> 00:24:15.715
This was from you?

408
00:24:15.798 --> 00:24:16.966
From him. actually.

409
00:24:19.218 --> 00:24:20.386
Join you!

410
00:24:20.469 --> 00:24:22.805
I am sorry. but I already belong
to a team.

411
00:24:23.097 --> 00:24:24.390
A team you dismissed!

412
00:24:24.473 --> 00:24:25.975
Look. I don't know you well.

413
00:24:26.225 --> 00:24:27.452
but I do know you'd never back down

414
00:24:27.476 --> 00:24:29.061
from a fight against evil.

415
00:24:29.145 --> 00:24:30.646
The only reason you stepped aside

416
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:31.772
was to protect them.

417
00:24:32.064 --> 00:24:33.608
Because. at the end of the day.

418
00:24:34.025 --> 00:24:35.067
they are just kids.

419
00:24:36.611 --> 00:24:39.030
And how exactly am I different. Batman?

420
00:24:43.534 --> 00:24:44.702
You're no kid.

421
00:24:44.785 --> 00:24:46.913
You got more combat expertise
than any of us.

422
00:24:47.413 --> 00:24:49.373
I have sworn to protect this world.

423
00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.417
And to stand up to any threat.

424
00:24:51.751 --> 00:24:52.793
But...

425
00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:55.463
But you're worried about
dissing your friends?

426
00:24:55.546 --> 00:24:56.964
This is bigger than that. Diana.

427
00:24:57.131 --> 00:24:58.007
If Luthor wins.

428
00:24:58.090 --> 00:24:59.967
a lot more than feelings
are gonna get hurt.

429
00:25:04.096 --> 00:25:05.640
<i>My precious son.</i>

430
00:25:05.848 --> 00:25:07.016
<i>Kal-El.</i>

431
00:25:07.099 --> 00:25:09.060
<i>There is much you must know</i>

432
00:25:09.143 --> 00:25:10.770
<i>about ancient Krypton.</i>

433
00:25:11.604 --> 00:25:12.521
Uh. Kara.

434
00:25:12.605 --> 00:25:14.774
I know this is like a piece
from your lost planet.

435
00:25:14.899 --> 00:25:17.735
So. please don't take this
the wrong way. but. snore.

436
00:25:18.444 --> 00:25:19.695
Zee. don't be rude!

437
00:25:21.155 --> 00:25:23.115
But can we just skip
to the part about the amulet?

438
00:25:24.367 --> 00:25:27.370
And for such
a technologically-advanced society.

439
00:25:27.453 --> 00:25:31.290
our home media playback systems
were surprisingly awful.

440
00:25:31.374 --> 00:25:35.628
<i>Then deglaze the pan
before adding the mushrooms.</i>

441
00:25:35.711 --> 00:25:38.172
<i>Cremini mushrooms
of planet Earth should be good.</i>

442
00:25:39.048 --> 00:25:41.300
You mean we gotta sit through
all of these?

443
00:25:41.425 --> 00:25:42.552
That'll take days.

444
00:25:42.928 --> 00:25:43.928
Not if I can get my data

445
00:25:43.971 --> 00:25:45.251
interface device up and running.

446
00:25:45.305 --> 00:25:47.224
I'll be able to download
everything in seconds.

447
00:25:47.516 --> 00:25:48.809
But if not. then. yes.

448
00:25:48.934 --> 00:25:50.143
It will take days.

449
00:25:50.978 --> 00:25:53.438
Uh. Isn't there at least a fast forward?

450
00:25:54.731 --> 00:25:57.693
Ugh. we weren't cave people. Barbara.

451
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.157
<i>My sweet. beloved. cherished Kal-El.</i>

452
00:26:04.616 --> 00:26:06.869
Uh. And I thought my dad was mushy.

453
00:26:07.494 --> 00:26:10.956
<i>My role as Krypton's
lead ancient historian</i>

454
00:26:11.206 --> 00:26:14.459
<i>is just as important
as my role as lead scientist.</i>

455
00:26:15.085 --> 00:26:18.380
<i>My role as lead economic advisor...</i>

456
00:26:19.506 --> 00:26:21.466
<i>Lead municipality specialist...</i>

457
00:26:22.467 --> 00:26:24.011
Lead flash fryer and tomato slicer

458
00:26:24.094 --> 00:26:25.888
at Krypton's number one
fast food chain...

459
00:26:25.971 --> 00:26:26.971
Here it is.

460
00:26:27.848 --> 00:26:30.017
<i>Long believed to be merely a relic</i>

461
00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.476
<i>from a lost science.</i>

462
00:26:31.852 --> 00:26:34.104
<i>the Amulet of Cythonna is. in fact.</i>

463
00:26:34.479 --> 00:26:36.023
<i>something far more sinister.</i>

464
00:26:36.732 --> 00:26:38.942
<i>For as impossible as it may seem.</i>

465
00:26:39.026 --> 00:26:40.485
<i>the crystal within</i>

466
00:26:40.819 --> 00:26:42.237
<i>does. in fact. contain</i>

467
00:26:42.571 --> 00:26:45.949
<i>the essence of the Goddess of Darkness.</i>

468
00:26:46.491 --> 00:26:47.492
Wait...

469
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:49.286
The actual goddess?

470
00:26:49.369 --> 00:26:50.369
<i>For eons.</i>

471
00:26:50.537 --> 00:26:51.830
<i>the imprisoned Cythonna</i>

472
00:26:51.914 --> 00:26:53.498
<i>has floated through the cosmos.</i>

473
00:26:53.582 --> 00:26:55.334
<i>in search of the one thing</i>

474
00:26:55.626 --> 00:26:57.044
<i>that may free her.</i>

475
00:26:57.127 --> 00:26:58.128
<i>Evil!</i>

476
00:26:58.712 --> 00:27:00.505
<i>She feeds on the souls</i>

477
00:27:00.589 --> 00:27:01.673
<i>of the wicked.</i>

478
00:27:01.757 --> 00:27:03.508
Like Luthor and the Legion of Doom.

479
00:27:03.675 --> 00:27:06.386
<i>The souls will become her servants</i>

480
00:27:06.595 --> 00:27:07.638
<i>and. in turn.</i>

481
00:27:08.096 --> 00:27:10.724
<i>create more evil for her to devour.</i>

482
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:12.850
Ooh. I get it.

483
00:27:12.893 --> 00:27:14.269
Luthor isn't using Cythonna.

484
00:27:14.353 --> 00:27:15.812
She's using him.

485
00:27:16.355 --> 00:27:17.522
That's actually way worse.

486
00:27:17.606 --> 00:27:19.566
<i>Once she has become strong enough.</i>

487
00:27:19.983 --> 00:27:22.319
<i>she will free herself from her prison.</i>

488
00:27:22.402 --> 00:27:23.487
<i>She will assume</i>

489
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:25.864
<i>a new Kryptonian vessel</i>

490
00:27:25.948 --> 00:27:27.908
<i>and reclaim the universe</i>

491
00:27:28.116 --> 00:27:29.368
<i>as her dominion.</i>

492
00:27:31.537 --> 00:27:34.540
The League has totally underestimated
what they're up against.

493
00:27:35.624 --> 00:27:37.626
We have to warn Aquaman.

494
00:27:37.709 --> 00:27:38.961
I mean. the League.

495
00:27:39.086 --> 00:27:40.166
We have to warn the League.

496
00:27:40.546 --> 00:27:41.546
I'll call Diana.

497
00:27:42.214 --> 00:27:43.090
Kara. what do you think

498
00:27:43.173 --> 00:27:45.634
your uncle meant by
"a new Kryptonian vessel"?

499
00:27:46.218 --> 00:27:47.387
I don't know.

500
00:27:47.637 --> 00:27:49.698
Well. I guess we could listen
to some more of my uncle...

501
00:27:49.722 --> 00:27:51.182
- I was just curious.
- No way.

502
00:27:51.349 --> 00:27:52.559
Guys.

503
00:27:52.642 --> 00:27:53.851
Diana's not answering.

504
00:27:56.771 --> 00:27:57.939
Hey. what's going on?

505
00:27:58.022 --> 00:28:00.024
I thought this was
supposed to be a crossover.

506
00:28:00.108 --> 00:28:01.442
Not that I'm complaining.

507
00:28:01.526 --> 00:28:03.570
but we haven't done anything here.

508
00:28:03.653 --> 00:28:05.405
While I am enjoying the escapades

509
00:28:05.488 --> 00:28:07.991
of the heroes
that are both girls and super.

510
00:28:08.074 --> 00:28:11.786
I do not see any evidence
of the crossing or the over.

511
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:14.414
Yeah. and what's the big deal
about this crossover anyway?

512
00:28:14.497 --> 00:28:17.000
We already met the Super Hero Girls
a bunch of times.

513
00:28:17.083 --> 00:28:19.085
Youse were even there
one time. you remembers?

514
00:28:19.168 --> 00:28:21.087
That was on your show. you clowns.

515
00:28:21.337 --> 00:28:24.173
And while your show plays fast
and loose with internal logic.

516
00:28:24.257 --> 00:28:25.925
throws continuity out its window.

517
00:28:26.009 --> 00:28:29.095
and chooses poop jokes
over actual story.

518
00:28:29.387 --> 00:28:32.348
their show maintains
a coherent. cohesive narrative.

519
00:28:32.724 --> 00:28:34.976
Yeah. but how are their ratings?

520
00:28:35.685 --> 00:28:38.146
- Meh.
- Wait a minute.

521
00:28:38.396 --> 00:28:39.230
That's it.

522
00:28:39.314 --> 00:28:41.441
We're not glomming onto
their popularity.

523
00:28:41.524 --> 00:28:42.984
They're glomming on to ours.

524
00:28:44.068 --> 00:28:46.112
I's. I's don't knows what to says.

525
00:28:46.362 --> 00:28:47.447
I feel so.

526
00:28:47.697 --> 00:28:49.365
so used right now.

527
00:28:50.033 --> 00:28:50.867
Indeed.

528
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:52.827
Much like the bauble
that Beast Boy for used

529
00:28:52.911 --> 00:28:54.329
for the propping up of the TV.

530
00:28:54.412 --> 00:28:56.581
I too am feeling wedged into something.

531
00:28:56.664 --> 00:28:58.249
to which I do not belong.

532
00:28:58.333 --> 00:29:01.336
With the assigned. expressed
purpose of holding it up.

533
00:29:02.337 --> 00:29:04.214
This stinks. Control Freak.

534
00:29:04.297 --> 00:29:05.924
Oh. come now. Robin.

535
00:29:06.007 --> 00:29:07.109
I thought you'd be flattered

536
00:29:07.133 --> 00:29:08.718
by how much they think of your funny.

537
00:29:08.801 --> 00:29:10.970
action-packed. popular show.

538
00:29:11.054 --> 00:29:13.264
Oh. Well. you flatter us.

539
00:29:13.348 --> 00:29:15.099
It is pretty... Hey!

540
00:29:15.266 --> 00:29:16.935
You can't blow me off with compliments.

541
00:29:17.018 --> 00:29:19.145
Yeah. I mean. if you don't
give us this event.

542
00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.581
at least you can give us something.

543
00:29:20.605 --> 00:29:21.940
Like a song. yo.

544
00:29:22.148 --> 00:29:23.274
Break it down. Cy.

545
00:29:24.108 --> 00:29:27.028
<i>You say you got us
In this crossover thang.</i>

546
00:29:28.821 --> 00:29:30.615
<i>But this ain't how it's supposed to go.</i>

547
00:29:30.782 --> 00:29:32.867
<i>It ain't supposed to be like this. y'all.</i>

548
00:29:33.868 --> 00:29:36.079
<i>Where's the part where we
Meet the other team.</i>

549
00:29:36.162 --> 00:29:37.997
<i>And then laughing.</i>

550
00:29:38.665 --> 00:29:40.416
<i>And the dumb misunderstandings.</i>

551
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.336
<i>- That bring us to blows.
- Oh. oh. oh. oh.</i>

552
00:29:43.419 --> 00:29:45.797
<i>- Don't crossover my heart.
- Don't do it.</i>

553
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.091
<i>Don't crossover my heart.</i>

554
00:29:48.174 --> 00:29:49.969
<i>We must find the compare and contrast.</i>

555
00:29:50.052 --> 00:29:52.721
<i>-To our counterparts -Yeah.</i>

556
00:29:52.805 --> 00:29:55.266
<i>Don't forget the obligatory romance.</i>

557
00:29:55.349 --> 00:29:57.476
<i>- Between two crossed hearts.
- Don't push it. Rob.</i>

558
00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:00.145
<i>Don't crossover my heart.</i>

559
00:30:00.229 --> 00:30:02.022
<i>Don't crossover.</i>

560
00:30:02.106 --> 00:30:03.106
Stop!

561
00:30:03.691 --> 00:30:05.972
And you wonder why you're not
featured in this event more.

562
00:30:12.825 --> 00:30:13.993
My trap has been set.

563
00:30:14.618 --> 00:30:16.618
Any remaining heroes
who oppose me will be crushed.

564
00:30:17.121 --> 00:30:18.664
But what of the Kryptonian?

565
00:30:19.582 --> 00:30:21.917
Look. I haven't forgotten your request.

566
00:30:23.294 --> 00:30:25.671
Perhaps I'll honor it. If it suits me.

567
00:30:28.757 --> 00:30:30.301
And it does suit me.

568
00:30:30.718 --> 00:30:32.636
The Kryptonian you require
will arrive shortly.

569
00:30:39.643 --> 00:30:43.898
The Legion's evil is making me stronger
by the second.

570
00:30:43.981 --> 00:30:45.900
Soon. I shall be free.

571
00:30:49.737 --> 00:30:51.780
I don't see any sign of Diana up here.

572
00:30:52.656 --> 00:30:54.408
I'm coming up empty too.

573
00:30:54.742 --> 00:30:56.202
Ugh. we better regroup.

574
00:30:56.785 --> 00:30:58.579
So the last any of us heard from her was

575
00:30:58.662 --> 00:31:00.080
that group text from an hour ago.

576
00:31:01.081 --> 00:31:01.916
Right!

577
00:31:01.999 --> 00:31:03.459
The one that just said. "I'm in"?

578
00:31:03.626 --> 00:31:05.169
Yeah. but in what?

579
00:31:05.628 --> 00:31:06.908
Actually. looking at this again.

580
00:31:06.962 --> 00:31:08.631
I think the real question might be.

581
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.426
who are all these other numbers
she included on that text?

582
00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:15.095
I just assumed it was another one
of Diana's tech goofs.

583
00:31:15.179 --> 00:31:17.389
because I don't
recognize any of the numbers.

584
00:31:17.473 --> 00:31:18.473
I do.

585
00:31:18.515 --> 00:31:19.683
This is Clark's.

586
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:22.019
And this one comes up as Jon Stewart.

587
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.106
Batman's emergency line is here too.

588
00:31:27.524 --> 00:31:29.777
So. maybe including these other numbers

589
00:31:30.152 --> 00:31:31.320
wasn't a mistake.

590
00:31:31.612 --> 00:31:34.073
But including ours was.

591
00:31:35.199 --> 00:31:37.117
And when Diana said "I'm in".

592
00:31:37.535 --> 00:31:38.369
she meant...

593
00:31:38.452 --> 00:31:39.995
In the Justice League.

594
00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:43.123
Just curious.

595
00:31:43.207 --> 00:31:44.583
That would make this last number.

596
00:31:44.667 --> 00:31:45.876
Aquaman's. right?

597
00:31:50.756 --> 00:31:53.718
Batman's traced the amulet's radiation
signature to this swamp.

598
00:31:53.802 --> 00:31:55.488
<i>We should be closing in
on the Legion's headquarters</i>

599
00:31:55.512 --> 00:31:56.512
<i>any second now.</i>

600
00:31:56.763 --> 00:31:58.682
Ah. about time. man.

601
00:31:58.765 --> 00:32:00.201
That dude can build anything
with that ring.

602
00:32:00.225 --> 00:32:02.477
Try a little lumbar support
next time. Am I right?

603
00:32:04.479 --> 00:32:06.273
Oh. okay. Another serious one. huh?

604
00:32:06.439 --> 00:32:07.315
I am sorry?

605
00:32:07.399 --> 00:32:08.608
No. no. it's cool.

606
00:32:08.692 --> 00:32:11.278
Just between Sergeant Green-never-grin.

607
00:32:11.361 --> 00:32:13.446
Dracula man and the Ego Scout.

608
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.991
this team's got
the personality of a sea sponge.

609
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.494
I do not know this
Sergeant Green-never grin.

610
00:32:20.579 --> 00:32:22.455
All right.

611
00:32:22.581 --> 00:32:24.916
Well. none of these guys
has a sense of humor.

612
00:32:25.125 --> 00:32:27.043
<i>All right. team.
Let's go over the plan.</i>

613
00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:28.879
Superman will lead the direct strike.

614
00:32:29.004 --> 00:32:30.714
While Batman uses the distraction

615
00:32:30.797 --> 00:32:32.340
to sneak in and steal the amulet.

616
00:32:37.387 --> 00:32:38.221
I'm gonna be honest here.

617
00:32:38.305 --> 00:32:40.223
I am not completely sure
what he just said.

618
00:32:40.307 --> 00:32:41.933
but I think it had something to do with

619
00:32:42.017 --> 00:32:44.269
using the amulet
to free the other dudes?

620
00:32:45.729 --> 00:32:47.289
All right. and then destroy the amulet.

621
00:32:47.314 --> 00:32:48.481
Right.

622
00:32:48.565 --> 00:32:49.845
Is it just me. or is anyone else

623
00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.419
having trouble understanding
the bat guy?

624
00:32:51.443 --> 00:32:53.043
'Cause I'd be surprised
if it was just me

625
00:32:53.111 --> 00:32:54.779
'cause I can understand jellyfish.

626
00:32:55.363 --> 00:32:56.489
<i>Got a visual.</i>

627
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:02.245
<i>And it looks like everyone's home.</i>

628
00:33:05.373 --> 00:33:06.666
Game's over. Luthor.

629
00:33:20.805 --> 00:33:22.182
Yep. it's a phony.

630
00:33:22.307 --> 00:33:24.267
Just something I whipped up
to get your attention.

631
00:33:24.476 --> 00:33:26.519
I call it a trans-thermal transmitter.

632
00:33:26.603 --> 00:33:28.396
but you can call it a trap.

633
00:33:35.195 --> 00:33:38.073
And you were
supposed to be the smart one.

634
00:33:38.156 --> 00:33:39.156
All right. team.

635
00:33:42.202 --> 00:33:43.203
This shouldn't take long.

636
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.210
Huh?

637
00:33:56.425 --> 00:33:57.426
Uh.

638
00:34:04.141 --> 00:34:05.141
Huh?

639
00:34:06.227 --> 00:34:07.227
Holograms?

640
00:34:07.562 --> 00:34:09.146
- What have you...
- Okay. be cool.

641
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.232
We may have walked into...

642
00:34:15.736 --> 00:34:16.737
Whatever that thing is.

643
00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:18.197
- it's made of...
- Kryptonite.

644
00:34:27.874 --> 00:34:29.750
I have what I need. Dispose of the rest.

645
00:34:32.211 --> 00:34:33.546
Stand strong. League!

646
00:34:50.479 --> 00:34:51.479
Hey!

647
00:34:51.522 --> 00:34:52.648
That's not cool. man.

648
00:34:57.737 --> 00:35:00.072
So not cool. man.

649
00:35:05.202 --> 00:35:07.997
Where are your little friends?

650
00:35:08.289 --> 00:35:10.249
This won't be the same without them.

651
00:35:10.333 --> 00:35:12.043
They're no threat to us now.

652
00:35:12.126 --> 00:35:15.379
Especially without their
precious captain.

653
00:35:16.005 --> 00:35:18.883
Hold up! This one's mine.

654
00:35:20.801 --> 00:35:22.845
Harley Quinn?

655
00:35:23.012 --> 00:35:25.431
- I will not spare...
- Ah. zip it would ya?

656
00:35:25.598 --> 00:35:27.183
What is this?

657
00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:30.519
These guys are out of control.

658
00:35:30.603 --> 00:35:32.355
and they're getting eviler
by the second.

659
00:35:32.438 --> 00:35:34.082
You need to get Babs
and your pals together

660
00:35:34.106 --> 00:35:35.107
and save the day.

661
00:35:35.191 --> 00:35:37.068
like you jerks always do.

662
00:35:38.319 --> 00:35:41.072
Harleen. I am afraid that is unlikely.

663
00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:42.406
For you see. I have...

664
00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:45.576
Ain't that something. I don't care. go.

665
00:35:46.118 --> 00:35:47.620
But...

666
00:35:47.995 --> 00:35:50.665
Uh... Ra-koom!

667
00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:57.171
Uh. welp. add another one
to the old Phantom Zone.

668
00:36:07.724 --> 00:36:11.520
So. I take it things aren't
going well on the other side.

669
00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:14.290
I can't believe the Legion of Doom

670
00:36:14.314 --> 00:36:16.149
took out a team
of heavy hitters like you.

671
00:36:16.275 --> 00:36:17.752
I can't believe you formed your own team

672
00:36:17.776 --> 00:36:19.903
and didn't call it. "Super Friends."

673
00:36:19.987 --> 00:36:21.363
Told you.

674
00:36:21.446 --> 00:36:24.491
And I can't believe
you didn't ask Hal Jordan

675
00:36:24.575 --> 00:36:26.994
to be your Green Lantern. I mean. Jon.

676
00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:28.704
you're cool and all. but...

677
00:36:30.289 --> 00:36:31.832
Come on!

678
00:36:32.875 --> 00:36:34.793
Hal Jordan!

679
00:36:35.502 --> 00:36:37.004
Unbelievable.

680
00:36:37.087 --> 00:36:38.463
She sold us out.

681
00:36:38.547 --> 00:36:40.340
Look. we're all mad at Diana.

682
00:36:40.424 --> 00:36:42.426
but we have to trust her decision.

683
00:36:42.551 --> 00:36:43.719
Tell 'em. Jess.

684
00:36:43.802 --> 00:36:47.139
Honestly. right now. I don't know.

685
00:36:47.222 --> 00:36:49.808
All my life. people have been
selling me short.

686
00:36:49.975 --> 00:36:51.935
But. Diana?

687
00:36:52.019 --> 00:36:54.730
I'm sure she's got
the team's best interests at heart.

688
00:36:54.813 --> 00:36:56.273
Face it. Babs.

689
00:36:56.356 --> 00:36:57.608
She dumped us.

690
00:36:59.067 --> 00:37:01.528
No. she loves us more than anything.

691
00:37:01.612 --> 00:37:02.922
I mean. after what she went through.

692
00:37:02.946 --> 00:37:04.266
with me and Harley Quinn alone...

693
00:37:06.366 --> 00:37:08.368
What about you and Harley?

694
00:37:08.869 --> 00:37:10.787
Oh. did I not mention

695
00:37:10.871 --> 00:37:12.581
Harley Quinn and Harleen Quinzel

696
00:37:12.664 --> 00:37:14.208
are actually one in the same?

697
00:37:14.416 --> 00:37:16.001
I mean. saying the names together.

698
00:37:16.084 --> 00:37:17.878
it's kind of obvious.
so you probably already

699
00:37:17.961 --> 00:37:19.463
figured it out. Right?

700
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.590
You and Diana knew

701
00:37:21.673 --> 00:37:24.301
your bestie was a super villain
and you didn't tell us?

702
00:37:24.384 --> 00:37:26.803
Technically. ex-bestie.

703
00:37:27.054 --> 00:37:29.598
She threw me off a train. Barbara!

704
00:37:30.724 --> 00:37:33.018
Zee?

705
00:37:33.852 --> 00:37:36.230
Babs. I...

706
00:37:36.313 --> 00:37:37.314
Forget it.

707
00:37:37.522 --> 00:37:38.732
I quit.

708
00:37:39.441 --> 00:37:40.943
Yup. me too.

709
00:37:41.985 --> 00:37:43.153
What do we do?

710
00:37:43.237 --> 00:37:44.613
What is there to do?

711
00:37:44.696 --> 00:37:46.698
The League is handling the bad guys.

712
00:37:47.449 --> 00:37:49.409
so. I guess...

713
00:37:50.494 --> 00:37:51.703
We go home.

714
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.127
<i>Good evening. Lex Luthor here.</i>

715
00:37:59.211 --> 00:38:01.046
<i>You know me
as the entrepreneurial genius</i>

716
00:38:01.129 --> 00:38:02.464
<i>who built a billion-dollar empire</i>

717
00:38:02.548 --> 00:38:03.383
<i>with nothing more than his</i>

718
00:38:03.466 --> 00:38:05.885
<i>preternatural savvy
and indomitable drive.</i>

719
00:38:05.969 --> 00:38:08.263
Today. I am allowing
these gifts to serve

720
00:38:08.346 --> 00:38:09.806
a much higher purpose.

721
00:38:09.889 --> 00:38:12.600
But first. I'd like to introduce
you to some friends of mine.

722
00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:15.562
The Legion of Doom.

723
00:38:18.106 --> 00:38:19.023
<i>I know. I know.</i>

724
00:38:19.107 --> 00:38:20.525
<i>Pretty cool name. Am I right?</i>

725
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:22.902
Anyway. about my new higher purpose.

726
00:38:23.361 --> 00:38:24.487
I. Lex Luthor

727
00:38:24.571 --> 00:38:25.989
<i>and my Legion of Doom.</i>

728
00:38:26.197 --> 00:38:28.866
<i>are going to take over the world.</i>

729
00:38:30.201 --> 00:38:32.036
<i>"You're saying." Come on. Lex.</i>

730
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.830
<i>How are you going
to take over the world?"</i>

731
00:38:34.289 --> 00:38:35.289
<i>Simple.</i>

732
00:38:37.292 --> 00:38:38.793
<i>You're gonna give it to us.</i>

733
00:38:39.085 --> 00:38:41.129
<i>Cast your eyes skyward. folks.</i>

734
00:38:47.302 --> 00:38:50.138
All right. Cythonna.
show us what you can really do.

735
00:39:05.653 --> 00:39:07.906
<i>So. this is when I say.</i>

736
00:39:07.989 --> 00:39:10.366
<i>you have 24 hours to meet our demands.</i>

737
00:39:12.035 --> 00:39:13.953
Oh. my gosh. I forgot the best part.

738
00:39:14.203 --> 00:39:16.206
Don't look for any clowns in tights
to save you.

739
00:39:16.372 --> 00:39:17.582
We've gotten rid of them all.

740
00:39:18.082 --> 00:39:19.834
Well. the important ones. anyway.

741
00:39:21.878 --> 00:39:24.547
You now have 23 hours and 59 minutes.

742
00:39:30.303 --> 00:39:32.972
Since when you become
the brooding type of bat?

743
00:39:33.056 --> 00:39:35.266
You picked the wrong time
to mess with...

744
00:39:35.516 --> 00:39:36.516
Harleen?

745
00:39:36.643 --> 00:39:38.436
- Where is the...
- Jester get-up?

746
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:40.021
Ah. taking a break.

747
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.942
Turns out I'm a big fan
of causing chaos.

748
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:45.818
but destroying the world?

749
00:39:45.902 --> 00:39:47.403
Eh. not so much.

750
00:39:47.654 --> 00:39:48.905
You quit the Legion?

751
00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.574
Does this mean
you're not a bad guy anymore?

752
00:39:51.699 --> 00:39:54.202
Let's just say. I'm taking a sabbatical.

753
00:39:54.452 --> 00:39:55.452
Really?

754
00:39:56.037 --> 00:39:58.081
Well. you couldn't have
quit at a better time.

755
00:39:58.289 --> 00:40:00.969
A group of A-list heroes like
Wonder Woman is about to kick their...

756
00:40:01.209 --> 00:40:02.126
What?

757
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:03.753
You don't know. do you?

758
00:40:03.836 --> 00:40:04.712
Know what?

759
00:40:04.796 --> 00:40:07.550
Eesh. Babs! Current events much?

760
00:40:10.386 --> 00:40:12.930
<i>Babs. emergency
at the junkyard. Hurry!</i>

761
00:40:17.893 --> 00:40:19.353
Bumblebee. I'm here.

762
00:40:19.478 --> 00:40:20.521
Where are you?

763
00:40:20.604 --> 00:40:22.022
Bumblebee. are you okay?

764
00:40:25.067 --> 00:40:26.235
Hmph!

765
00:40:27.194 --> 00:40:28.821
You got Bumblebee's distress call too?

766
00:40:28.946 --> 00:40:30.197
Harley Quinn.

767
00:40:30.781 --> 00:40:32.199
What did you do with her?

768
00:40:32.283 --> 00:40:34.076
Hold up. Zee. She's with me.

769
00:40:34.201 --> 00:40:36.537
And that changes what exactly. Babs?

770
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.872
Whoa. easy! For once.

771
00:40:39.039 --> 00:40:41.250
this girl's not with anybody.

772
00:40:41.333 --> 00:40:43.085
Even less reason to trust you.

773
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:44.545
Quit arguing!

774
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:46.171
We've got to find Bumblebee.

775
00:40:46.255 --> 00:40:47.381
I'm right here.

776
00:40:47.464 --> 00:40:49.091
I faked an emergency call.

777
00:40:49.174 --> 00:40:50.926
- Wait. What?
- So not cool.

778
00:40:51.218 --> 00:40:53.470
Because we got to talk.

779
00:40:53.804 --> 00:40:54.722
Look.

780
00:40:54.805 --> 00:40:57.683
I know we have different ideas of what
being a superhero means.

781
00:40:57.766 --> 00:41:00.019
and honestly. that's what makes us...

782
00:41:00.477 --> 00:41:02.438
made us. such a good team.

783
00:41:03.772 --> 00:41:05.566
But what made us a great team

784
00:41:05.816 --> 00:41:06.859
is that we always agreed

785
00:41:06.942 --> 00:41:08.861
on the one thing a superhero isn't.

786
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:10.570
Selfish.

787
00:41:14.033 --> 00:41:16.535
We've been putting our own issues
ahead of the greater good.

788
00:41:16.994 --> 00:41:19.496
Whether it's a big shadow
only you can see.

789
00:41:19.747 --> 00:41:22.208
or questioning the virtue
of someone you love.

790
00:41:22.416 --> 00:41:24.710
or questioning the virtue in yourself.

791
00:41:25.336 --> 00:41:26.921
Or maybe you're just afraid

792
00:41:27.004 --> 00:41:28.881
to tell your friends
to be quiet and listen

793
00:41:29.006 --> 00:41:30.633
when they're making a huge mistake.

794
00:41:31.175 --> 00:41:33.510
Well. it's time to get over ourselves.

795
00:41:33.761 --> 00:41:35.721
So. be quiet and listen!

796
00:41:36.722 --> 00:41:38.349
The League may have made a big mistake

797
00:41:38.474 --> 00:41:40.142
by underestimating the Legion of Doom.

798
00:41:40.434 --> 00:41:42.728
But by claiming victory
without even considering us.

799
00:41:42.937 --> 00:41:44.813
the bad guys made
an even bigger mistake.

800
00:41:45.397 --> 00:41:48.317
They underestimated
the Super Hero Girls.

801
00:41:48.484 --> 00:41:50.152
Time to kick some Legion butt.

802
00:41:50.236 --> 00:41:51.278
Yeah.

803
00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:53.239
A word of advice.

804
00:41:53.322 --> 00:41:55.366
If you're planning to storm
the Hall of Doom.

805
00:41:55.532 --> 00:41:56.784
bring hand towels.

806
00:41:57.034 --> 00:41:58.869
The restroom dryers are the pits!

807
00:41:59.411 --> 00:42:00.829
Wait. Harleen.

808
00:42:00.913 --> 00:42:02.081
You're not going to help?

809
00:42:02.248 --> 00:42:04.708
I said I didn't want
to destroy the world.

810
00:42:04.792 --> 00:42:07.086
Never said nothing about saving it.

811
00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:09.588
Forget her.

812
00:42:09.713 --> 00:42:10.799
We got work to do.

813
00:42:11.007 --> 00:42:12.801
First. we got to get our leader back.

814
00:42:12.926 --> 00:42:14.344
Now. just a minute.

815
00:42:14.511 --> 00:42:16.012
She made a mistake. Kara.

816
00:42:16.096 --> 00:42:17.096
One mistake.

817
00:42:17.264 --> 00:42:19.558
How many of yours has she let slide?

818
00:42:21.142 --> 00:42:22.310
Let's go get her.

819
00:42:22.644 --> 00:42:24.980
But how? Isn't she in the Phantom Zone?

820
00:42:25.397 --> 00:42:26.273
Seriously?

821
00:42:26.356 --> 00:42:28.251
Have any of you been checking
your phones. at all?

822
00:42:28.275 --> 00:42:29.794
- We've had a lot going on.
- Lost my charger.

823
00:42:29.818 --> 00:42:31.570
Only to check the fashion month feed.

824
00:42:35.907 --> 00:42:37.075
<i>My beloved sisters.</i>

825
00:42:37.617 --> 00:42:38.743
<i>I have wronged you.</i>

826
00:42:38.827 --> 00:42:41.162
I mean. it's cool she figured out
how to send a video.

827
00:42:41.246 --> 00:42:43.641
but you think she'd have realized
her thumb was covering the scree...

828
00:42:43.665 --> 00:42:45.041
Babs. listen.

829
00:42:45.667 --> 00:42:47.294
<i>I know now.</i>

830
00:42:47.502 --> 00:42:49.004
<i>that in trying to protect you.</i>

831
00:42:49.421 --> 00:42:51.256
<i>I only hurt you. deeply.</i>

832
00:42:55.343 --> 00:42:56.720
And because of this failure.

833
00:42:56.887 --> 00:42:59.598
I have humbly returned
to Themyscira. Mother.

834
00:42:59.681 --> 00:43:01.892
There is a first for everything.

835
00:43:01.975 --> 00:43:04.644
You of all people know
this is not my first failure.

836
00:43:05.061 --> 00:43:07.439
but it is my greatest.

837
00:43:07.522 --> 00:43:09.900
I was referring to your tears.

838
00:43:09.983 --> 00:43:13.028
I cannot recall
ever seeing you cry. my child.

839
00:43:14.446 --> 00:43:17.365
As your mother.
I did everything in my power

840
00:43:17.449 --> 00:43:20.035
to ensure failure never befall you.

841
00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.870
I know. Mother. Thank you.

842
00:43:21.953 --> 00:43:25.332
However. the one lesson I never taught

843
00:43:25.415 --> 00:43:27.417
was what to do when it does.

844
00:43:28.126 --> 00:43:29.794
We all fail. Diana.

845
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:31.838
And that was my failure.

846
00:43:32.088 --> 00:43:34.758
One we will now rectify.

847
00:43:35.008 --> 00:43:35.884
We?

848
00:43:36.009 --> 00:43:39.262
Lucky for you. we're all really familiar
with screwing up.

849
00:43:39.512 --> 00:43:41.973
Yeah. we can give you the crash course.

850
00:43:45.518 --> 00:43:47.354
We'll take it from here. Poly.

851
00:43:49.272 --> 00:43:50.190
Sisters.

852
00:43:50.273 --> 00:43:52.067
You are here. I thought you...

853
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:53.068
Broke up?

854
00:43:53.151 --> 00:43:54.151
We did.

855
00:43:54.194 --> 00:43:56.321
But Karen had a really inspiring speech.

856
00:43:56.446 --> 00:43:58.156
Ooh. do the speech thing again. Karen.

857
00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.450
It was more of an in-the-moment thing.

858
00:44:00.575 --> 00:44:02.661
But we did watch your thumb apology.

859
00:44:02.911 --> 00:44:04.204
And thanks to Jess' ring.

860
00:44:04.329 --> 00:44:06.164
we got here a lot faster
than your row-boat.

861
00:44:06.414 --> 00:44:08.875
Now. come on.
There's no more time for hugs.

862
00:44:09.793 --> 00:44:11.962
Well. maybe one more.

863
00:44:13.756 --> 00:44:15.091
All right. Diana.

864
00:44:15.258 --> 00:44:16.509
let's save the world.

865
00:44:16.676 --> 00:44:18.219
You still trust me to lead you?

866
00:44:18.803 --> 00:44:19.971
More than ever. D.

867
00:44:30.064 --> 00:44:31.482
With no other option.

868
00:44:31.774 --> 00:44:34.986
the United Council of Nations
cedes its power

869
00:44:35.194 --> 00:44:36.696
to the Legion of Doom.

870
00:44:40.241 --> 00:44:41.576
We make a good team.

871
00:44:41.659 --> 00:44:43.869
Not bad for a Kryptonian.

872
00:44:44.745 --> 00:44:45.830
What?

873
00:44:45.913 --> 00:44:48.457
I think we're past any delusions

874
00:44:48.583 --> 00:44:52.461
of this being an actual partnership.
aren't we. Alexander?

875
00:44:52.837 --> 00:44:54.130
What on earth are you...

876
00:44:54.213 --> 00:44:55.381
Stop talking.

877
00:44:58.593 --> 00:45:01.679
With my power near its peak.
it's time you assume the role

878
00:45:01.762 --> 00:45:04.015
I'd always intended for you
and your Legion.

879
00:45:04.515 --> 00:45:05.725
Servitude.

880
00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:08.144
I await your command. Cythonna.

881
00:45:08.728 --> 00:45:10.062
Funny thing is.

882
00:45:10.229 --> 00:45:14.066
you've been serving me since the moment
you touched my amulet.

883
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:18.279
You were just too blinded by your own
greed and ambition to realize it.

884
00:45:18.863 --> 00:45:19.863
So blind.

885
00:45:20.197 --> 00:45:21.574
What will you have me do?

886
00:45:21.866 --> 00:45:23.951
Ugh! I shall soon be free.

887
00:45:24.243 --> 00:45:26.454
I want to see my new Kryptonian body.

888
00:45:36.756 --> 00:45:38.132
What was that?

889
00:45:38.216 --> 00:45:39.216
The Kryptonian.

890
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.218
Just like...

891
00:45:40.301 --> 00:45:41.301
I told you.

892
00:45:41.344 --> 00:45:44.263
I needed the world's
strongest Kryptonian.

893
00:45:44.347 --> 00:45:45.389
That was.

894
00:45:45.848 --> 00:45:47.767
Wait. You mean...

895
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:51.020
Unlike that one.
Kara's strength is yet to peak.

896
00:45:51.145 --> 00:45:53.522
Her strong will alone
makes her far more suitable

897
00:45:53.606 --> 00:45:56.150
for divinity than this useless thing.

898
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:59.069
Wait!

899
00:45:59.528 --> 00:46:01.197
He may not be completely useless.

900
00:46:05.076 --> 00:46:08.746
Our only chance is to catch the Legion
off guard with a surprise offensive.

901
00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:10.873
Like going by these schematics
Batman gave you.

902
00:46:11.165 --> 00:46:12.750
I don't see any way to sneak in.

903
00:46:12.875 --> 00:46:14.752
But maybe we could sneak out.

904
00:46:19.758 --> 00:46:21.134
Hey. what gives? It's empty.

905
00:46:21.218 --> 00:46:22.261
Sorry.

906
00:46:22.344 --> 00:46:23.905
I downloaded the data
to figure out a way

907
00:46:23.929 --> 00:46:25.973
to get to the Phantom Zone
and rescue our friends.

908
00:46:26.139 --> 00:46:29.268
You mean. you think you can create
our own dimensional portal?

909
00:46:29.351 --> 00:46:30.351
Exactly.

910
00:46:30.435 --> 00:46:32.729
But now I'm thinking we can create
something even better.

911
00:46:32.813 --> 00:46:34.773
Whoa! A dimensional waterslide?

912
00:46:34.982 --> 00:46:38.527
So. we know Cythonna's magic has
unlimited access to the Phantom Zone.

913
00:46:38.694 --> 00:46:40.404
which makes the amulet like a hub.

914
00:46:40.529 --> 00:46:41.530
Theoretically speaking.

915
00:46:41.613 --> 00:46:43.299
it correlates with what
quantum physicists call

916
00:46:43.323 --> 00:46:44.825
a Hamiltonian density matrix.

917
00:46:45.075 --> 00:46:45.909
Here. look.

918
00:46:46.076 --> 00:46:48.912
Bottom line. a way in is a way out.

919
00:46:49.121 --> 00:46:50.998
Wait. I see what Karen's thinking.

920
00:46:51.248 --> 00:46:53.458
You figure out a way to travel
to the Phantom Zone.

921
00:46:53.542 --> 00:46:54.542
grab our friends.

922
00:46:54.626 --> 00:46:56.336
but then come back through the amulet.

923
00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:58.672
Which would put us smack-dab
in the middle of

924
00:46:58.755 --> 00:47:00.173
the Hall of Doom.

925
00:47:00.257 --> 00:47:02.718
With all of the heroes in full force.

926
00:47:02.885 --> 00:47:04.720
Talk about a sneak attack.

927
00:47:04.803 --> 00:47:06.346
Do you really think you could do it?

928
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:08.557
No. but you can.

929
00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.683
Uh. come again?

930
00:47:09.766 --> 00:47:11.852
I can figure out how to navigate
through dimensions

931
00:47:11.977 --> 00:47:13.057
but without the right tech.

932
00:47:13.103 --> 00:47:15.397
we have to travel the same way
Cythonna does.

933
00:47:15.606 --> 00:47:16.773
With magic.

934
00:47:17.482 --> 00:47:19.818
Well. why didn't you say so?
I'm your girl.

935
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:22.237
Dark magic.

936
00:47:22.487 --> 00:47:25.073
Oh. dark...

937
00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.784
Yeah. I mean. I guess.

938
00:47:28.285 --> 00:47:29.536
<i>Kara.</i>

939
00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.497
<i>Kara Zor-El.</i>

940
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.125
Kara Zor-El of Krypton.

941
00:47:42.799 --> 00:47:44.176
Cythonna.

942
00:47:44.468 --> 00:47:47.554
I apologize if I interrupted you
and your friends

943
00:47:47.679 --> 00:47:50.807
planning what promises to be
an adorable yet futile attack.

944
00:47:51.141 --> 00:47:52.184
What do you want?

945
00:47:52.809 --> 00:47:55.270
Simple. I want you to come get...

946
00:47:55.812 --> 00:47:56.730
Him.

947
00:47:56.813 --> 00:47:57.898
Kal. No!

948
00:47:57.981 --> 00:47:58.982
Want him?

949
00:47:59.566 --> 00:48:01.026
Come get him.

950
00:48:01.944 --> 00:48:04.488
Goddess or not. I swear I will beat you.

951
00:48:05.155 --> 00:48:06.657
Kara.

952
00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.450
Kara. are you okay?

953
00:48:08.533 --> 00:48:10.619
Listen. Diana.
you go rescue our friends.

954
00:48:11.036 --> 00:48:12.496
I need to face Cythonna.

955
00:48:12.579 --> 00:48:14.831
What? Kara. I must insist...

956
00:48:14.915 --> 00:48:17.292
I know. I know. You think
I'm being my bullheaded self.

957
00:48:17.376 --> 00:48:19.253
and I am.

958
00:48:19.336 --> 00:48:21.297
But they have Clark.

959
00:48:21.381 --> 00:48:22.465
- Then we should...
- Diana.

960
00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:25.885
I am asking you to trust me now.

961
00:48:32.016 --> 00:48:33.851
Okay. I think we're ready to go.

962
00:48:35.186 --> 00:48:37.313
- Where's Kara?
- Supergirl will meet us there.

963
00:48:37.855 --> 00:48:39.941
Trust she knows
what she's doing. sisters.

964
00:48:40.066 --> 00:48:41.066
I do.

965
00:48:41.234 --> 00:48:42.569
Now. let us away.

966
00:48:42.735 --> 00:48:45.780
All aboard The Phantom Zone Express.

967
00:48:45.905 --> 00:48:46.905
Bubble us up. Jess.

968
00:48:51.661 --> 00:48:53.454
Okay. Zee. Go time.

969
00:48:53.538 --> 00:48:57.166
All right. Dark. creepy and often
uncontrollable magic coming up.

970
00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:58.251
It's okay. Zee.

971
00:48:58.334 --> 00:48:59.377
You got this.

972
00:49:11.764 --> 00:49:13.391
I never thought I would say this. but.

973
00:49:13.558 --> 00:49:16.644
burritos for lunch was a horrible idea.

974
00:49:16.728 --> 00:49:20.523
Zee. each off-shoot tunnel is a gateway
to a different dimension.

975
00:49:20.648 --> 00:49:22.609
The Phantom Zone is coming up.

976
00:49:22.692 --> 00:49:24.319
Now. make sure you...

977
00:49:24.444 --> 00:49:25.695
<i>You're gonna blow it.</i>

978
00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.655
Stop it. Stop.

979
00:49:27.989 --> 00:49:30.408
I can do this. I can.

980
00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:32.160
You don't seem so sure of yourself.

981
00:49:32.243 --> 00:49:33.661
How can you be sure of anything

982
00:49:33.745 --> 00:49:35.139
when you're not even sure
of who you are?

983
00:49:35.163 --> 00:49:36.748
You're nothing. A nobody.

984
00:49:36.831 --> 00:49:37.707
No one loves you.

985
00:49:37.832 --> 00:49:39.167
- You are a freak.
- A phoney.

986
00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.293
A monster.

987
00:49:40.376 --> 00:49:42.045
No wonder your mom left.

988
00:49:42.295 --> 00:49:43.504
Stop it.

989
00:49:49.844 --> 00:49:51.554
Did I do it?

990
00:49:51.721 --> 00:49:54.641
I'm not sure. but I think so.

991
00:49:55.433 --> 00:49:57.101
Sisters. at the ready.

992
00:49:57.894 --> 00:50:00.647
Weird. Awfully bright
for a Phantom Zone.

993
00:50:02.565 --> 00:50:05.735
Are we sure
we're in the right dimension?

994
00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:08.738
No. I'm not sure.

995
00:50:09.113 --> 00:50:10.531
The dark magic...

996
00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:11.908
It's okay. Zee.

997
00:50:12.158 --> 00:50:15.203
I mean. we don't know
that this isn't the Phantom Zone.

998
00:50:15.578 --> 00:50:16.955
Yeah. of course it is.

999
00:50:17.205 --> 00:50:19.290
Now. let's find the other heroes.

1000
00:50:19.624 --> 00:50:21.084
Uh. I see heroes.

1001
00:50:21.417 --> 00:50:23.963
but I don't think they're the ones
we're looking for.

1002
00:50:25.673 --> 00:50:27.424
BB. you seeing what I'm seeing?

1003
00:50:28.884 --> 00:50:31.011
It's the Super Hero Girls. yo.

1004
00:50:34.139 --> 00:50:37.768
Oh. yes. the team
I wish to be the member of.

1005
00:50:37.851 --> 00:50:42.273
but refuse to say as such so as to spare
the feelings of my current team.

1006
00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:49.738
We actually have a door. but whatever.

1007
00:50:51.782 --> 00:50:54.785
Oh. come on.
This literally happened yesterday.

1008
00:50:54.868 --> 00:50:58.747
You mean. we've already been
crossed over and no one told us?

1009
00:50:59.206 --> 00:51:01.709
Well. the hits just keep on coming.

1010
00:51:02.376 --> 00:51:03.419
Just watch.

1011
00:51:03.794 --> 00:51:05.337
You'll play a very important role

1012
00:51:05.504 --> 00:51:06.672
in this story before its end.

1013
00:51:06.755 --> 00:51:08.549
Trust me!

1014
00:51:09.758 --> 00:51:10.758
Hmm.

1015
00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:13.137
We apologize. but do we know you?

1016
00:51:14.847 --> 00:51:16.181
Good one. Wonder lady.

1017
00:51:16.265 --> 00:51:18.100
I didn't realize you were the funny one.

1018
00:51:18.183 --> 00:51:20.060
It's like you're the 'me' of your team.

1019
00:51:20.144 --> 00:51:22.104
Come on. guys. It's us.

1020
00:51:22.187 --> 00:51:23.731
The Teen Titans.

1021
00:51:23.856 --> 00:51:25.482
You mean. the tween titans.

1022
00:51:25.858 --> 00:51:27.234
Didn't we babysit you once?

1023
00:51:27.443 --> 00:51:28.443
"Babysit"?

1024
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:31.530
Do I in any way look like a baby to you?

1025
00:51:33.115 --> 00:51:34.199
Oh. I gets it.

1026
00:51:34.408 --> 00:51:35.910
They are good enough for our show.

1027
00:51:35.993 --> 00:51:37.703
but the moments we shows up
in their thing.

1028
00:51:37.786 --> 00:51:39.538
it's all like. "What's going on?

1029
00:51:39.663 --> 00:51:40.664
Who's are you?"

1030
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:41.789
Hey. that's right!

1031
00:51:41.832 --> 00:51:43.375
Continuity snobs.

1032
00:51:43.542 --> 00:51:45.836
Guys. I think I know what's going on.

1033
00:51:46.212 --> 00:51:49.173
We've ended up in some kind
of parallel universe.

1034
00:51:49.757 --> 00:51:51.592
One that's similar to ours.

1035
00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:54.178
But with way larger heads.

1036
00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:55.721
And hands.

1037
00:51:55.804 --> 00:51:57.181
Our hands are very large too.

1038
00:51:58.724 --> 00:52:00.226
So I guess I did mess up.

1039
00:52:01.435 --> 00:52:04.939
As fellow heroes. you can appreciate
the gravity of our mission.

1040
00:52:05.022 --> 00:52:08.234
for we face a crisis
of catastrophic proportions.

1041
00:52:10.277 --> 00:52:12.404
Forgive us if we seem underwhelmed

1042
00:52:12.571 --> 00:52:15.199
but we eat crises of
catastrophic proportions

1043
00:52:15.366 --> 00:52:16.492
for breakfast.

1044
00:52:16.575 --> 00:52:19.286
They're called jalapeño waffle bombs.
yo. Ha-ha!

1045
00:52:19.536 --> 00:52:22.039
Okay. Super Hero Girls. we'll help you.

1046
00:52:22.373 --> 00:52:24.583
Really. we just need a couple
of spare computer parts.

1047
00:52:24.667 --> 00:52:26.335
But I'm only saying this once.

1048
00:52:26.418 --> 00:52:28.213
My world. My rules.

1049
00:52:28.421 --> 00:52:29.673
I call the shots.

1050
00:52:29.756 --> 00:52:31.633
I say jump. you say. "I already did

1051
00:52:31.758 --> 00:52:34.135
because I'm so in tune
with your amazing leadership skills.

1052
00:52:34.219 --> 00:52:36.572
I knew what you were going to ask me
before you could even ask it."

1053
00:52:36.596 --> 00:52:38.640
Are we clear?

1054
00:52:39.057 --> 00:52:39.933
Oh. wow.

1055
00:52:40.016 --> 00:52:41.810
Is it possible that
you're even more annoying

1056
00:52:41.977 --> 00:52:43.270
than the Robin in my universe?

1057
00:52:50.652 --> 00:52:51.796
I'm pretty sure I can fix it.

1058
00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:52.696
True. True.

1059
00:52:52.779 --> 00:52:54.030
But let me hit you with this.

1060
00:52:54.114 --> 00:52:56.575
Why fix when you can upgrade?

1061
00:52:56.658 --> 00:52:58.326
Because I only need to...

1062
00:52:58.410 --> 00:52:59.661
Picture it. other BB.

1063
00:52:59.744 --> 00:53:03.290
This baby. with its own ultra TK
mega library of video games.

1064
00:53:03.456 --> 00:53:05.041
A taquito warming drawer.

1065
00:53:05.166 --> 00:53:06.166
Racing stripes.

1066
00:53:06.376 --> 00:53:08.587
Why would a computer
need racing stripes?

1067
00:53:09.337 --> 00:53:11.673
A computer would not need
racing stripes.

1068
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.593
But a remote control
funnel cake deep-fryer would.

1069
00:53:14.759 --> 00:53:15.759
No way.

1070
00:53:18.096 --> 00:53:19.222
Any animal?

1071
00:53:19.389 --> 00:53:20.389
Mmm-hmm.

1072
00:53:20.432 --> 00:53:22.100
How about a fairy armadillo?

1073
00:53:23.518 --> 00:53:24.644
Oh. an aye-aye.

1074
00:53:24.728 --> 00:53:26.104
Aye. Aye.

1075
00:53:26.313 --> 00:53:27.147
Ooh!

1076
00:53:27.272 --> 00:53:28.272
A Chengdu yak.

1077
00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:30.942
Ooh! Does this mean
you have four stomachs?

1078
00:53:31.067 --> 00:53:32.067
I don't knows.

1079
00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:33.110
Let's find out.

1080
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:45.457
That's not sitting right.

1081
00:53:45.624 --> 00:53:47.459
Ah. better.

1082
00:53:47.542 --> 00:53:48.542
Hold up!

1083
00:53:52.255 --> 00:53:53.965
Uh-oh. Here comes number three.

1084
00:53:55.383 --> 00:53:57.093
How is it getting worse each time?

1085
00:54:00.388 --> 00:54:01.388
Last one.

1086
00:54:04.976 --> 00:54:06.394
Four stomachs in the house.

1087
00:54:07.687 --> 00:54:09.856
I got to go to the little yak's room.

1088
00:54:16.071 --> 00:54:17.405
Oh. hey. Starfire.

1089
00:54:18.031 --> 00:54:21.034
You guys sure do
things differently here.

1090
00:54:21.117 --> 00:54:23.787
I. too. was a comer
to the newness of this world

1091
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:26.373
on a day that was
not long from this one.

1092
00:54:26.456 --> 00:54:28.041
Bet that took getting used to.

1093
00:54:28.124 --> 00:54:30.294
Permit me to give the piece of advice?

1094
00:54:30.461 --> 00:54:31.671
Sure. let's hear it.

1095
00:54:32.088 --> 00:54:35.007
Despite the deliciousness
of their appearance.

1096
00:54:35.299 --> 00:54:38.261
cats may not be ingested.

1097
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:44.684
Oh. Uh. thank you. Starfire.

1098
00:54:44.934 --> 00:54:46.185
Good to know.

1099
00:54:47.603 --> 00:54:49.230
Yeah. my team would
pretty much follow me

1100
00:54:49.313 --> 00:54:50.356
to the end of the Earth.

1101
00:54:50.439 --> 00:54:51.482
I mean. it's not like

1102
00:54:51.607 --> 00:54:53.526
being a better team leader
is a competition.

1103
00:54:53.609 --> 00:54:56.028
It's just. well. if it were.
I'd probably win.

1104
00:54:56.153 --> 00:54:57.655
And. if this mug is to be believed.

1105
00:54:57.738 --> 00:54:59.073
I already have.

1106
00:54:59.907 --> 00:55:01.701
You bought that yourself. didn't you?

1107
00:55:01.867 --> 00:55:03.536
What? No!

1108
00:55:03.953 --> 00:55:07.832
Sheesh! Sounds like someone's got
a little mug envy.

1109
00:55:07.915 --> 00:55:09.417
Well. I have no mug.

1110
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.627
nor any such boastful
beverage conveyance.

1111
00:55:11.711 --> 00:55:15.256
I do have a lasso that can compel anyone
to tell the truth.

1112
00:55:15.339 --> 00:55:16.465
Would you like to try it?

1113
00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:19.093
I bought the mug.

1114
00:55:23.639 --> 00:55:25.391
You find them instantly
annoying too. huh?

1115
00:55:27.977 --> 00:55:29.145
They're not so bad.

1116
00:55:31.147 --> 00:55:33.482
We only have one bonehead on our team.

1117
00:55:33.858 --> 00:55:34.858
Me.

1118
00:55:34.901 --> 00:55:36.652
It's my fault we're stuck here.

1119
00:55:37.695 --> 00:55:38.696
Messed up a spell?

1120
00:55:38.779 --> 00:55:39.864
It happens.

1121
00:55:41.949 --> 00:55:42.992
It's more than a spell.

1122
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:45.453
There's a part of me.

1123
00:55:45.661 --> 00:55:46.746
A dark part.

1124
00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:49.040
I've always been frightened of it.

1125
00:55:49.457 --> 00:55:50.750
But. lately...

1126
00:55:52.126 --> 00:55:54.086
Never mind. it's complicated.

1127
00:55:55.713 --> 00:55:56.713
Yeah.

1128
00:55:56.756 --> 00:55:58.356
I wish there was some way
I could relate.

1129
00:55:58.758 --> 00:56:00.218
Oh. wait. I just remembered.

1130
00:56:00.468 --> 00:56:02.762
I am Raven. daughter of Trigon.

1131
00:56:02.929 --> 00:56:05.932
demonic overlord of all he surveys.

1132
00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.653
Not bad. other BB.

1133
00:56:18.819 --> 00:56:21.072
- We did it.
- You were right.

1134
00:56:21.322 --> 00:56:23.241
The racing stripes are a nice touch.

1135
00:56:23.407 --> 00:56:24.727
You two got the computer working?

1136
00:56:25.117 --> 00:56:26.869
I just need to power
the external V-drive.

1137
00:56:27.078 --> 00:56:30.206
So we'll need a AAA battery.
like the one in a TV remote.

1138
00:56:36.213 --> 00:56:38.006
Our universe doesn't have remotes.

1139
00:56:38.173 --> 00:56:39.675
Yeah. yeah.

1140
00:56:39.758 --> 00:56:41.843
We's control TVs with our minds.

1141
00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:47.766
Fear not. We will find a battery...

1142
00:56:47.849 --> 00:56:49.726
Oh. yeah. <i>Battleship Bake Off!</i>

1143
00:56:49.893 --> 00:56:52.646
So. did you have a battery. or no?

1144
00:56:53.647 --> 00:56:55.566
Huh? Battery? Oh. yeah.

1145
00:56:55.649 --> 00:56:56.483
Help yourself.

1146
00:56:56.567 --> 00:56:57.943
I think I saw one in the garage.

1147
00:56:58.110 --> 00:56:59.945
Or did I see one in the foyer?

1148
00:57:00.195 --> 00:57:01.822
Ooh la-la. Fo-yay.

1149
00:57:01.989 --> 00:57:04.074
He means fo-yur. yo.

1150
00:57:04.241 --> 00:57:06.076
Fo-yur? Where's your flair?

1151
00:57:06.159 --> 00:57:07.035
Your passion?

1152
00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:08.495
Get some culture. fool.

1153
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.706
- It's pronounced fo-yur. bro.
- Nah-uh.

1154
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:12.291
Fo-yay. all the way.

1155
00:57:12.374 --> 00:57:13.959
Of course. this building comes equipped

1156
00:57:14.042 --> 00:57:16.837
with neither the fo-yur. nor the fo-yay.

1157
00:57:17.129 --> 00:57:19.381
That's really not the point now.
is it. Starfire?

1158
00:57:19.464 --> 00:57:20.883
We do so have a foyer.

1159
00:57:20.966 --> 00:57:22.676
Wait. That's really more of a portico.

1160
00:57:22.759 --> 00:57:24.303
Do you have a battery or not?

1161
00:57:25.137 --> 00:57:26.471
Yes. You remind me of me.

1162
00:57:26.555 --> 00:57:28.223
Let's go find one.

1163
00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.185
Oh. oh. no. he did not.

1164
00:57:32.978 --> 00:57:34.438
Right. let's go.

1165
00:57:36.148 --> 00:57:39.401
So. Luthor.
what's the first order of business

1166
00:57:39.484 --> 00:57:41.987
as rulers of the world?

1167
00:57:42.738 --> 00:57:43.822
Luthor?

1168
00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:47.117
Uh. hello?

1169
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.200
What's with him?

1170
00:57:52.915 --> 00:57:53.999
Where is Superman?

1171
00:57:57.794 --> 00:57:59.546
Where is Superman?

1172
00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:00.756
Get her!

1173
00:58:02.799 --> 00:58:03.799
That's enough. children.

1174
00:58:07.596 --> 00:58:09.223
Come. let's talk.

1175
00:58:12.726 --> 00:58:15.354
You've always believed in me. yes?

1176
00:58:15.437 --> 00:58:17.648
Let's just say I heard stories.

1177
00:58:17.731 --> 00:58:20.567
Then you know my essence
will soon be free.

1178
00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:24.529
and I shall require a strong.
new Kryptonian body.

1179
00:58:24.613 --> 00:58:27.741
Ain't happening.
Kal-El's coming with me.

1180
00:58:27.824 --> 00:58:32.579
Oh. And you wonder why others presume
Kal-El is superior to you.

1181
00:58:32.746 --> 00:58:35.540
when you yourself
make the same presumption.

1182
00:58:35.624 --> 00:58:38.795
Wait. you mean. you... you want me?

1183
00:58:39.295 --> 00:58:43.299
Well. I mean. I can't blame you.
I am pretty awesome.

1184
00:58:44.509 --> 00:58:50.223
Join me. and together. we will show
the universe the true meaning of power.

1185
00:58:51.057 --> 00:58:53.601
Yeah. that's going to be a hard pass.

1186
00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:55.603
Oh. well. in that case...

1187
00:58:59.482 --> 00:59:01.442
- Kal!
- Submit...

1188
00:59:02.026 --> 00:59:03.278
or he dies.

1189
00:59:04.571 --> 00:59:06.239
I'll give you
some time to think about it.

1190
00:59:09.409 --> 00:59:11.452
No! You can't do this.

1191
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.002
It's not about
not having dark thoughts. Zee.

1192
00:59:19.085 --> 00:59:21.963
It's about embracing those thoughts
as part of who you are.

1193
00:59:22.255 --> 00:59:25.133
But what if I do embrace them.
and I lose control?

1194
00:59:25.592 --> 00:59:27.302
What if I hurt someone?

1195
00:59:27.385 --> 00:59:29.137
Hmm. You might be surprised

1196
00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:31.020
what darkness can do.
if you give it a chance.

1197
00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:32.807
Out of all the infinite universes.

1198
00:59:32.891 --> 00:59:35.059
your magic just happened
to bring you here.

1199
00:59:35.143 --> 00:59:37.604
where you got a brief and
narratively convenient pep-talk

1200
00:59:37.729 --> 00:59:40.189
from someone who deals
with the exact same thing.

1201
00:59:47.196 --> 00:59:49.198
Yeesh! Who would've thunk
getting a little battery

1202
00:59:49.282 --> 00:59:50.700
would become such an epic hassle?

1203
00:59:50.909 --> 00:59:53.036
Dude. we face way epic-er hassles

1204
00:59:53.119 --> 00:59:55.371
for much smaller stakes all the time.

1205
00:59:55.455 --> 00:59:56.455
It's kind of our thing.

1206
01:00:00.168 --> 01:00:03.630
Back online and ready to go.
I just hope Zee's up to it.

1207
01:00:05.381 --> 01:00:07.926
Next up. Phantom Zone.

1208
01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.805
You know. you might want to bring
the big guns with you on this mission.

1209
01:00:14.015 --> 01:00:15.808
Are they fighting over a remote?

1210
01:00:15.892 --> 01:00:19.270
Come on. BB. I've seen this episode.

1211
01:00:21.397 --> 01:00:24.067
Er. we appreciate the offer. Boy Wonder.

1212
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:25.443
But this is our fight.

1213
01:00:25.526 --> 01:00:26.569
No. I get it.

1214
01:00:26.736 --> 01:00:28.571
It's your big adventure.

1215
01:00:28.905 --> 01:00:30.740
Bringing us along would
only upstage you.

1216
01:00:31.324 --> 01:00:34.786
I guess this is goodbye.
Thank you. Raven.

1217
01:00:41.669 --> 01:00:43.003
Bye Cy.

1218
01:00:43.128 --> 01:00:44.755
Let me know how
<i>Battleship Bake Off</i> ends.

1219
01:00:44.922 --> 01:00:46.090
Peace. love and animals. yo!

1220
01:00:46.173 --> 01:00:47.550
Keep them racing stripes shiny.

1221
01:00:47.716 --> 01:00:48.968
Take me with you!

1222
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:53.264
So long! By the way.
our adventure was in theaters.

1223
01:00:56.767 --> 01:00:57.768
You okay. Zee?

1224
01:00:58.519 --> 01:00:59.979
Oh. I'm better than okay.

1225
01:01:00.396 --> 01:01:01.438
Whee!

1226
01:01:05.901 --> 01:01:08.487
Kara. I told you to...

1227
01:01:08.696 --> 01:01:10.531
I know what you told me. Kal.

1228
01:01:10.656 --> 01:01:12.700
Just because you think
you're so much better than me

1229
01:01:12.783 --> 01:01:13.927
doesn't mean you can tell me...

1230
01:01:13.951 --> 01:01:16.912
I'm not better than you. Kara.
Not by a long shot.

1231
01:01:19.873 --> 01:01:22.835
Then why are you
always such a jerk to me?

1232
01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.795
I never told you this. but

1233
01:01:24.878 --> 01:01:27.548
when you first got here.
I was so excited.

1234
01:01:27.631 --> 01:01:30.843
I thought. finally someone else
who will understand

1235
01:01:30.926 --> 01:01:32.887
just how lonely it is to be...

1236
01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:35.848
Super. You know.
saying it out loud just now...

1237
01:01:36.223 --> 01:01:39.143
Mm. it is kind of pretentious
to call ourselves that.

1238
01:01:39.226 --> 01:01:40.811
You're not lonely. Kara.

1239
01:01:40.895 --> 01:01:43.230
Look at your friends. They're family.

1240
01:01:43.314 --> 01:01:46.358
Then look at mine. Ugh. Batman? Really?

1241
01:01:46.442 --> 01:01:48.485
- Dude's got serious issues.
- Wait.

1242
01:01:48.819 --> 01:01:51.030
Are you jealous of my friends?

1243
01:01:51.113 --> 01:01:53.782
I'm jealous of your strength.

1244
01:01:53.866 --> 01:01:57.077
Okay. I'm only going to say this because
you said something kind of nice. but.

1245
01:01:57.703 --> 01:02:00.998
Kal. you are way stronger than me.

1246
01:02:01.165 --> 01:02:02.917
Well. I am Superman.

1247
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.920
But that's not what I mean.

1248
01:02:07.087 --> 01:02:08.923
I was born with super strength.

1249
01:02:09.089 --> 01:02:12.092
It was handed to me. But. you.

1250
01:02:12.176 --> 01:02:15.012
your strength. your true strength

1251
01:02:15.095 --> 01:02:18.724
of character. of conviction.
you earned that on your own.

1252
01:02:19.433 --> 01:02:21.644
Way before you got anywhere
near a yellow sun.

1253
01:02:23.229 --> 01:02:25.314
Now we know there's gotta be an answer.

1254
01:02:25.606 --> 01:02:28.108
You just gotta use those noggins
right there. man.

1255
01:02:28.192 --> 01:02:30.110
You gotta use them to grab that answer.

1256
01:02:31.028 --> 01:02:32.905
Seriously. man. nothing?

1257
01:02:33.113 --> 01:02:37.701
- Is it a bread box?
- Ding-ding-ding. you got it.

1258
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:40.788
Man. you're good. kid.
You are good. Whoo!

1259
01:02:49.256 --> 01:02:50.799
Anyone need a lift?

1260
01:02:51.466 --> 01:02:54.678
Any second. your master
shall be set free.

1261
01:03:04.145 --> 01:03:06.481
Heroes! Take them down!

1262
01:03:11.903 --> 01:03:13.363
If I had my mace...

1263
01:03:18.451 --> 01:03:19.452
Huh?

1264
01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.163
I shrunk it down to bring to you.

1265
01:03:22.247 --> 01:03:25.625
but totally forgot about it until
you said something. Sorry.

1266
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:28.128
Oh. I missed you too.

1267
01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:29.629
Hey. Batman!

1268
01:03:30.964 --> 01:03:34.593
So. I know you know about the Joker.
but did you hear about me and Bane?

1269
01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:43.226
Oh. you did? Yeah? I beat him
pretty good. First try. too. Heh.

1270
01:03:43.310 --> 01:03:44.910
How'd you do against him
your first time?

1271
01:03:51.067 --> 01:03:54.362
I wish I had a clever remark
about you both being feline villains.

1272
01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:05.540
Looks as if you two
are ready for a cat nap.

1273
01:04:06.124 --> 01:04:07.404
Stick with what you know. Diana.

1274
01:04:12.172 --> 01:04:15.383
Oh. that the hardest Lantern can hit?

1275
01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:16.550
No.

1276
01:04:18.929 --> 01:04:21.014
That is the hardest Lantern can hit.

1277
01:04:21.348 --> 01:04:23.516
Oh. now I get why they went with you.

1278
01:04:24.643 --> 01:04:28.188
Grundy angry.

1279
01:04:30.815 --> 01:04:33.944
How many Lanterns are there?

1280
01:04:34.027 --> 01:04:36.279
Three. It's a big number. I know.

1281
01:04:36.363 --> 01:04:37.948
Keep trying. you'll get there.

1282
01:04:41.993 --> 01:04:44.537
These no hold Grundy.

1283
01:04:44.621 --> 01:04:46.414
Yeah. that's kind of the point.

1284
01:04:48.709 --> 01:04:51.420
Oh. and all without
even throwing a punch.

1285
01:04:51.504 --> 01:04:53.130
Ah. look at that!

1286
01:04:53.214 --> 01:04:56.133
Got you again. Totally feeling
deja vu right now.

1287
01:04:56.217 --> 01:04:57.843
So am I.

1288
01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:01.264
- Back off. slick!
- Huh?

1289
01:05:01.347 --> 01:05:04.600
Throwing cheap shots
at this one's my job.

1290
01:05:05.518 --> 01:05:08.437
Oh. my gosh. you changed your mind.

1291
01:05:08.688 --> 01:05:11.941
Come on! You knew I was always
gonna come around.

1292
01:05:12.024 --> 01:05:14.860
I just wanted to make
one of those perfectly-timed

1293
01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:17.572
bad-guy-turns-good dramatic entrances.

1294
01:05:17.655 --> 01:05:18.823
How'd I do?

1295
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:21.200
Oh. pretty good. Thanks.

1296
01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:24.245
Can you see what's happening?

1297
01:05:24.912 --> 01:05:27.373
Kryptonite's messing
with my X-ray vision.

1298
01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.083
- Oh. no.
- What is it?

1299
01:05:30.543 --> 01:05:32.712
- She's free.
- Quick. Kara.

1300
01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:36.757
You gotta run.

1301
01:05:37.049 --> 01:05:38.217
She'll come for you.

1302
01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:40.678
I'm not leaving you
like this. Kal.

1303
01:05:40.845 --> 01:05:42.805
Why do you have to be so bullheaded?

1304
01:05:42.889 --> 01:05:45.558
Yeah. yeah. I am bullheaded. aren't I?

1305
01:05:46.017 --> 01:05:47.810
Cythonna. I give up.

1306
01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:49.729
Do you hear me?

1307
01:05:49.812 --> 01:05:51.856
Kara... What are you doing?

1308
01:05:51.939 --> 01:05:52.939
Sorry. Kal.

1309
01:05:53.232 --> 01:05:54.275
I have no choice.

1310
01:05:54.692 --> 01:05:56.152
It's your lucky day.

1311
01:05:56.402 --> 01:05:58.863
I give up to you. Cythonna.

1312
01:05:59.071 --> 01:06:00.615
I'm all yours.

1313
01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:03.242
Kara! No!

1314
01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:10.290
Okay.

1315
01:06:10.458 --> 01:06:11.792
What exactly happened here?

1316
01:06:12.376 --> 01:06:16.172
Felt like evil overdrive.

1317
01:06:16.547 --> 01:06:18.049
Totally grody.

1318
01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:19.341
Ugh!

1319
01:06:22.011 --> 01:06:23.488
That's the last of 'em. Wonder Woman.

1320
01:06:23.512 --> 01:06:25.890
Good work. Hal.
Any sign of Supergirl yet?

1321
01:06:25.973 --> 01:06:28.184
Nope. Not of her or Superman.

1322
01:06:28.601 --> 01:06:29.601
Come on. Kara.

1323
01:06:34.106 --> 01:06:35.107
Kara?

1324
01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:39.612
Kara is gone.

1325
01:06:40.112 --> 01:06:42.657
I am Cythonna.

1326
01:06:44.283 --> 01:06:45.493
What do we do. Wonder Woman?

1327
01:06:55.879 --> 01:06:58.298
Hal. you and the others
get the Legion to safety.

1328
01:06:58.382 --> 01:06:59.383
We got Cythonna.

1329
01:06:59.466 --> 01:07:01.093
No way. She's too powerful.

1330
01:07:01.301 --> 01:07:03.345
Carter. they can handle it.

1331
01:07:03.762 --> 01:07:05.973
This is a job for the Super Hero Girls.

1332
01:07:06.098 --> 01:07:07.098
Mmm-hmm.

1333
01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:13.480
Okay. Dee. what's the plan?

1334
01:07:17.192 --> 01:07:18.652
We fight.

1335
01:07:19.903 --> 01:07:22.906
I was so hoping you would say that.

1336
01:07:24.408 --> 01:07:26.285
Diana!

1337
01:07:36.545 --> 01:07:38.046
Kara. stop!

1338
01:07:38.422 --> 01:07:39.715
Kara!

1339
01:07:40.465 --> 01:07:41.967
<i>Kara!</i>

1340
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:54.104
A rather strange representation
of your inner mind. Kara Zor-El.

1341
01:07:54.646 --> 01:07:56.315
It's my happy place.

1342
01:07:56.398 --> 01:07:59.401
Means I still run things in here.

1343
01:07:59.484 --> 01:08:02.070
I knew I wouldn't stand a chance
against you in the real world.

1344
01:08:02.237 --> 01:08:03.488
but I figure now.

1345
01:08:03.572 --> 01:08:05.866
at least I have some
home-field advantage.

1346
01:08:09.912 --> 01:08:12.789
Wait. are you challenging me?

1347
01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:15.250
Yeah. something like that.

1348
01:08:27.846 --> 01:08:28.847
Kara?

1349
01:08:29.514 --> 01:08:31.683
Guys. she's fighting it.

1350
01:08:35.604 --> 01:08:36.604
What is that?

1351
01:08:38.232 --> 01:08:40.609
What do you mean.
in case I ever got out of line?

1352
01:08:40.984 --> 01:08:42.861
Serious issues.

1353
01:08:47.366 --> 01:08:49.201
You caught me off guard.

1354
01:08:49.534 --> 01:08:51.662
Seems even I underestimated you.

1355
01:08:51.745 --> 01:08:54.040
Yeah. a lot of that going around.

1356
01:09:12.767 --> 01:09:14.769
But you are no match for me.

1357
01:09:19.107 --> 01:09:21.109
Kara. are you still in there?

1358
01:09:21.693 --> 01:09:24.028
Oh. she's still here. suffering.

1359
01:09:35.290 --> 01:09:36.666
Batman. wait!

1360
01:09:38.334 --> 01:09:40.545
I said. stand down!

1361
01:09:43.214 --> 01:09:45.675
Uh. I. I'd do what she says. Bruce.

1362
01:09:46.384 --> 01:09:48.386
Sisters. Kara is in there.

1363
01:09:48.553 --> 01:09:49.929
She needs us.

1364
01:09:51.264 --> 01:09:54.517
Kara. it is Diana. Fight this.

1365
01:09:56.644 --> 01:09:58.813
- Come on. Kara.
- Kick her butt.

1366
01:09:58.897 --> 01:10:00.064
We believe in you.

1367
01:10:00.273 --> 01:10:01.900
Show her who's boss in there.

1368
01:10:08.114 --> 01:10:10.533
<i>We are with you. sister. always.</i>

1369
01:10:11.659 --> 01:10:13.745
- You got this. Kara.
- You got this. Kara.

1370
01:10:13.828 --> 01:10:15.788
- You can do this.
- Do this.

1371
01:10:26.758 --> 01:10:27.842
Kara!

1372
01:10:31.888 --> 01:10:33.348
I believe in you.

1373
01:10:33.431 --> 01:10:34.724
I always have.

1374
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:36.643
Now kick her butt.

1375
01:10:36.726 --> 01:10:40.813
I can't wait to turn
your despicable world to ash.

1376
01:10:41.147 --> 01:10:44.817
This place only makes me
all of the more homesick for Krypton.

1377
01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.445
You know what I miss most about Krypton?

1378
01:10:47.946 --> 01:10:49.197
The crystals.

1379
01:11:00.793 --> 01:11:04.505
No. not again. Not again!

1380
01:11:05.172 --> 01:11:07.258
Zee. anywhere but here.

1381
01:11:20.271 --> 01:11:21.480
You did it. Kara.

1382
01:11:21.564 --> 01:11:23.190
Thanks for trusting me. D.

1383
01:11:23.732 --> 01:11:24.732
Hmm?

1384
01:11:29.029 --> 01:11:30.465
It's not like we're besties
or anything now.

1385
01:11:30.489 --> 01:11:32.491
but he is clearing out a room for me

1386
01:11:32.575 --> 01:11:33.951
in the Fortress of Solitude.

1387
01:11:34.034 --> 01:11:35.578
You mean the Buddy Bunker?

1388
01:11:35.703 --> 01:11:37.496
Batman.

1389
01:11:37.871 --> 01:11:38.872
He can wait.

1390
01:11:38.956 --> 01:11:41.959
You know. ever since Robin
got all swept up in his Nightwing phase.

1391
01:11:42.042 --> 01:11:43.627
he's been bugging me.

1392
01:11:43.711 --> 01:11:47.339
Wow. I remember when you would have
killed to be his sidekick.

1393
01:11:47.423 --> 01:11:49.967
Well. I've got my own sidekick now.

1394
01:11:51.635 --> 01:11:54.138
Oh. no. you're the sidekick.

1395
01:11:54.221 --> 01:11:57.558
This girl's a headliner
through and through.

1396
01:11:59.184 --> 01:12:01.312
Besides. if Batman really needed help.

1397
01:12:01.395 --> 01:12:03.522
he's got his League buddies. right. Dee?

1398
01:12:03.731 --> 01:12:06.567
Yes. while I agreed to be
a reserve member.

1399
01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:08.235
my true place is here.

1400
01:12:12.281 --> 01:12:13.282
Wait a minute.

1401
01:12:13.449 --> 01:12:16.201
They're talking about feelings
and what they learned?

1402
01:12:16.285 --> 01:12:18.245
That only happens at the end of the...

1403
01:12:18.329 --> 01:12:21.040
This is the denouement.

1404
01:12:21.373 --> 01:12:22.958
The de-new-ment!

1405
01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:26.170
It's de-now-ement. Lord Fauntleroy.

1406
01:12:26.879 --> 01:12:27.963
Not today. BB.

1407
01:12:28.047 --> 01:12:29.298
This show's over.

1408
01:12:29.381 --> 01:12:31.133
And we weren't even in it.

1409
01:12:31.216 --> 01:12:32.801
I am not understanding.

1410
01:12:32.885 --> 01:12:35.763
You said we had the role
that is big to play.

1411
01:12:35.846 --> 01:12:37.348
Keep watching.

1412
01:12:38.891 --> 01:12:40.809
You know. Zee. I've been meaning to ask.

1413
01:12:40.893 --> 01:12:43.229
Where did you send
that Cythonna crystal anyway?

1414
01:12:43.395 --> 01:12:45.115
You know. since I've come
to terms with this

1415
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:49.276
whole dark magic part of me.
I figured let it decide.

1416
01:13:04.334 --> 01:13:06.336
Now I know what you're up to.
Control Freak.

1417
01:13:06.586 --> 01:13:09.005
Or should I say. Cythonna!

1418
01:13:16.596 --> 01:13:19.182
Man. it's like a farago of B.O..
barbecue corn chips

1419
01:13:19.266 --> 01:13:20.684
and rancid strawberry milk.

1420
01:13:21.768 --> 01:13:24.437
Cayenne and onion chips. thank you.

1421
01:13:24.521 --> 01:13:26.982
I knew something was up
when you complimented Robin.

1422
01:13:27.065 --> 01:13:28.358
Who does that?

1423
01:13:28.483 --> 01:13:30.443
But now you've shown your hand.

1424
01:13:30.527 --> 01:13:33.863
And for the record.
I was always on to you. Cythonna.

1425
01:13:33.989 --> 01:13:35.365
Even before Raven was. I'm sure.

1426
01:13:35.448 --> 01:13:38.952
But. I too was waiting for you
to show your hand.

1427
01:13:39.035 --> 01:13:40.035
Really?

1428
01:13:40.078 --> 01:13:42.038
What is my hand. Boy Wonder?

1429
01:13:42.831 --> 01:13:44.499
Well. I could tell you.

1430
01:13:44.583 --> 01:13:46.585
but I don't want to step
on Raven's toes.

1431
01:13:46.668 --> 01:13:48.003
She wants her crystal back.

1432
01:13:52.966 --> 01:13:54.551
That's right. It is mine.

1433
01:13:54.676 --> 01:13:55.760
Now. give it to me!

1434
01:13:56.177 --> 01:13:57.429
Starfire. catch.

1435
01:13:58.346 --> 01:14:00.140
- Give what to you?
- Ah!

1436
01:14:00.223 --> 01:14:01.308
The crystal!

1437
01:14:03.268 --> 01:14:05.896
Oh. you mean the crystal
that was in the hand.

1438
01:14:05.979 --> 01:14:07.939
but is now no longer in the hand

1439
01:14:08.023 --> 01:14:09.357
because of the keeping of away.

1440
01:14:09.441 --> 01:14:11.234
Give it! Give it.

1441
01:14:11.693 --> 01:14:14.070
Horrible. horrible children.
Give it to me.

1442
01:14:14.195 --> 01:14:15.864
I demand it. My crystal.

1443
01:14:15.947 --> 01:14:18.533
Give it to me. you horrible.
horrible children.

1444
01:14:18.617 --> 01:14:19.617
I will destroy you.

1445
01:14:19.659 --> 01:14:21.620
I will destroy this whole universe.

1446
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:24.664
We told you. C-train.
we don't do epic threats.

1447
01:14:24.831 --> 01:14:26.751
Raven. send this fool somewhere
they give a snot.

1448
01:14:27.584 --> 01:14:29.210
At once! I demand you.

1449
01:14:29.294 --> 01:14:30.879
Please! I need it.

1450
01:14:30.962 --> 01:14:32.589
No!

1451
01:14:35.425 --> 01:14:36.468
Now what's we gonna dos?

1452
01:14:36.551 --> 01:14:38.803
I means. the TV's crooked. yo.

1453
01:14:38.887 --> 01:14:40.805
Nuh-uh. I can't watch a crooked TV.

1454
01:14:40.889 --> 01:14:43.183
You know the strain
that's gonna put on my neck servos?

1455
01:14:43.975 --> 01:14:47.520
So. Raven. where did you send
our friend and her little crystal?

1456
01:14:47.771 --> 01:14:49.564
I don't know. Somewhere.

1457
01:14:52.817 --> 01:14:56.112
<i>Meanwhile. at the Hall of Justice...</i>

1458
01:14:58.114 --> 01:15:00.659
Great Scott. what is this?

1459
01:15:03.495 --> 01:15:05.748
According to the Justice League
computer.

1460
01:15:05.873 --> 01:15:07.833
it's from this crossover dimension.

1461
01:15:07.917 --> 01:15:09.460
Holy crossovers!

1462
01:15:09.543 --> 01:15:11.003
Does this mean the Super Friends

1463
01:15:11.087 --> 01:15:13.923
have to travel to this strange
dimension and return it?

1464
01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.818
That is going to be a hard pass
from the Super Friends.
