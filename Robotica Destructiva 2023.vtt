3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.808
Beyond space and time.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.738
lies a dimension where life
has evolved into machines.

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.558
and the most dangerous
weapon in the universe

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.342
is a force called love.

7
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.928
We've detected an unidentified spacecraft

8
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.398
approaching the citadel.

9
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.231
They are not responding
to our transmissions.

10
00:02:13.198 --> 00:02:14.845
They're going
to smash into the energy field

11
00:02:14.887 --> 00:02:16.447
if they don't slow down.

12
00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.608
Something's wrong. The
energy shields are dropping.

13
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.120
Impossible.

14
00:02:35.095 --> 00:02:36.454
Red alert.

15
00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:39.428
Energy shield has been deactivated.

16
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.557
All units stand by.

17
00:03:01.653 --> 00:03:03.444
Situation critical.

18
00:03:03.486 --> 00:03:05.077
Situation critical.

19
00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:09.002
All units proceed to the citadel.

20
00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.368
Ah. what you got
there. a karaoke machine?

21
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.593
I don't know what it is.

22
00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:47.126
but it's gonna bury us
in gold-coated plastic

23
00:03:47.168 --> 00:03:48.678
for years to come.

24
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.118
Better find a good place to hide it.

25
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.658
in case we get boarded by
the interplanetary goon squad.

26
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.169
Yeah. I'll just tuck it away

27
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:57.258
in one of these junkers over here.

28
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.728
Gonna have to talk to Krogarr

29
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.698
about using our ship as a storage unit.

30
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.713
You think if we sold this
for scrap. he would notice?

31
00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:08.328
Ah. if you know Krogarr.
he's got inventory on everything.

32
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.263
Yeah. I hear ya.

33
00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:29.538
For thousands of years.
the Arculon Destroyer

34
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.408
has protected our planet
from the intergalactic hoards

35
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.198
that would seek to strip of its resources.

36
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.868
We must activate the Destructivas.

37
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.718
Only their primitive
warlike ways can save us.

38
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.194
The Destructivas are too unpredictable.

39
00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:46.248
They may elect to destroys us themselves.

40
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.688
We have no choice.

41
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.688
Once word gets out
that the Arculon is gone.

42
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.892
our world will be picked
apart from all sides.

43
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.778
Are you sure you want to do this?

44
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.280
Once they're out. there's no turning back.

45
00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:10.470
Do it.

46
00:05:39.866 --> 00:05:43.388
You have reached the
doors of enlightenment.

47
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.818
To open the gates and
advance to the next level.

48
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.068
you must choose.

49
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.063
The all-seeing heart of love.

50
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.143
or the chainsaw of destruction.

51
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.838
One will take you into a
world of joy and happiness.

52
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.908
Hmm. Ugh.

53
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.338
The other
will take you to a place

54
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.978
of death and destruction.

55
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.519
Ah. yes!

56
00:06:18.376 --> 00:06:21.215
Hey. Take it easy. I'm just an employee!

57
00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:29.186
Who dares
awaken us from our slumber?

58
00:06:29.228 --> 00:06:31.410
Please. We mean you no harm.

59
00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:36.511
What year is this?

60
00:06:36.553 --> 00:06:39.362
The year is 8675309.

61
00:06:39.404 --> 00:06:41.810
Our world is in desperate
need of your capabilities.

62
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.733
I was having the strangest dream.

63
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.218
Everything was green
and I was made of water.

64
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.203
For thousands of years while you slept.

65
00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.965
our world has evolved into a utopia.

66
00:06:55.007 --> 00:06:57.332
free from war and strife.

67
00:06:57.374 --> 00:06:59.897
Our utopia's come to
rely on a super weapon

68
00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:01.338
called the Arculon Destroyer.

69
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.228
It has been stolen from us.

70
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.648
We are now defenseless
against the thousands of worlds

71
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.658
that hunger for our resources.

72
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.328
This weapon is so important to you.

73
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.428
yet you lose it so easily.

74
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.199
Why do you call on us?

75
00:07:15.241 --> 00:07:17.268
We need your help to
hunt down the Arculon

76
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.728
and return it to us so
we may defend our world.

77
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.318
Clean up your own messes.

78
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.017
I was one step away from
enlightenment. you droogs.

79
00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:27.108
Retrieve the Arculon
Destroyer and you will be returned

80
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.958
to the dream existence with
which you were extracted.

81
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.938
Never to be bothered again.

82
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.618
You have our word.

83
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.948
They have proven to
be honorable custodians

84
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.995
of our hyper sleep.

85
00:07:38.037 --> 00:07:40.038
Mytra?

86
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.588
I'm on board with
whatever you want to do.

87
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.421
I dunno.

88
00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.653
Ugh. All right then.

89
00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:48.103
We accept your terms.

90
00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:55.588
We've located the
Arculon heading 38 degrees

91
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.678
towards the outer rim of the galaxy.

92
00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.928
Most likely to be delivered
to one of the many pirates

93
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.638
that reside in that sector.

94
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.948
We have your coordinates locked in.

95
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.588
We will bring back your weapon.

96
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.417
May the eternal drums
of the night guide your way.

97
00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:11.315
Okay. get on with it.

98
00:08:28.283 --> 00:08:31.008
This is cargo
transport vessel Egulon Nepsis.

99
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.568
reporting heavy damage.

100
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.009
Reactor core has ruptured.
Engines are inoperative.

101
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:36.618
Our weapons have been disabled.

102
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.208
Please send repair crew

103
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.058
at the earliest possible convenience.

104
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.458
This is cargo transport
vessel Egulon Nepsis.

105
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.623
reporting heavy damage.

106
00:08:45.498 --> 00:08:46.715
Reactor has ruptured. Engine-

107
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.598
So what are you gonna
do with all the tokens

108
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.012
you're about to make?

109
00:08:52.054 --> 00:08:55.260
Trog not think so much about future.

110
00:08:55.302 --> 00:08:57.976
Trog always in present.

111
00:08:58.018 --> 00:09:02.317
Trog enjoy journey.
Not so much destination.

112
00:09:04.516 --> 00:09:06.948
Hey. it's a Kro mission!

113
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.308
Hello my friends. How was your mission?

114
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.768
Let me tell you. it's
been quite the adventure.

115
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.628
And a successful one I might add.

116
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.335
That's what I like to hear.

117
00:09:16.377 --> 00:09:19.368
Uh. you will all be rewarded mightily.

118
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.147
May the solar winds
guide you to your salvation.

119
00:09:23.189 --> 00:09:24.656
Or whatever.

120
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.858
What'd I tell you guys?

121
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.308
Crime pays and pay is good. Ha!

122
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.198
Yeah. but just think what we can do

123
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.058
if we had the right tools.

124
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.548
What are you getting at. Strobo?

125
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.166
Time travel.

126
00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:40.518
Balderdash!

127
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.488
No! It's the opposite of balderdash!

128
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.978
Look. we find some time crystals.

129
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.958
recalibrate a hyperspace
drive to fold space time.

130
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.108
go back before the
beginning of all of this.

131
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.668
and I don't know.

132
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.658
go on "Wheel of Non-Fungibility".

133
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.664
We'd be a big hit.

134
00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:03.010
Balderdash!

135
00:10:05.512 --> 00:10:08.598
We are representatives
sent by the Planet Radia

136
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.298
to retrieve the Arculon Destroyer.

137
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.877
Stand down now and prepare to be boarded.

138
00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:16.574
Balderdash!

139
00:10:24.331 --> 00:10:25.788
I think our ship just exploded.

140
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.894
It matters not. We will take theirs.

141
00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:40.350
Come on. they just
landed the boarding craft.

142
00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:50.712
Haunted.

143
00:10:50.754 --> 00:10:52.013
Ghosts.

144
00:10:52.055 --> 00:10:55.314
Come on. we'll squeeze
through the service tube!

145
00:10:59.882 --> 00:11:02.315
All right. everybody
just settle down now.

146
00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:06.378
Where is the Arculon?

147
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.642
Gone. We delivered it yesterday.

148
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.897
Wrong! We traced the signal.

149
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.518
You'll never find it on this ship.

150
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.348
I hid it good. Ha!

151
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.038
Found it.

152
00:11:31.843 --> 00:11:33.426
Everybody freeze!

153
00:11:34.737 --> 00:11:35.528
Like I said. free-

154
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.223
Ah!

155
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.687
Don't make another
move or I'll push the button.

156
00:11:50.633 --> 00:11:53.445
Young lady. you have no
idea what you're messing with.

157
00:11:53.487 --> 00:11:56.328
I don't suppose it's too
late to work out a deal?

158
00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.128
All right. into the escape pod.

159
00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.770
Don't make me push this button.

160
00:11:59.812 --> 00:12:00.969
Get in there.

161
00:12:01.011 --> 00:12:03.738
We have 600 tokens coming our way.

162
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.808
We don't mind splitting it with you.

163
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.568
Move it.

164
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.708
You know what. you can take it all.

165
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.828
Just take me with you. I'm good in a fight.

166
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.797
These guys are cramping my style anyway.

167
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.298
Well you are.

168
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.398
We leave you with your lives.

169
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.188
Others have not been so lucky.

170
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.286
Pull that lever on your right.

171
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.622
This is cargo
transport vessel Egulon Nepsis

172
00:12:39.664 --> 00:12:41.212
reporting heavy damage.

173
00:12:41.254 --> 00:12:43.883
Reactor core has ruptured.
Engines are inoperative.

174
00:12:43.925 --> 00:12:44.998
Our weapons have been disabled.

175
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.469
Please send a repair crew

176
00:12:46.511 --> 00:12:48.729
at the earliest possible convenience.

177
00:12:52.018 --> 00:12:55.207
Egulon Nepsis reporting heavy
damage. Reactor core has-

178
00:12:55.249 --> 00:12:56.940
This transmission makes no sense.

179
00:12:56.982 --> 00:12:57.773
Our weapons...

180
00:12:57.815 --> 00:12:59.839
Why reveal you have no weapons?

181
00:12:59.881 --> 00:13:01.835
Foolish mechanoids.

182
00:13:01.877 --> 00:13:03.868
Or it's a trap.

183
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.515
But if it's not...

184
00:13:05.557 --> 00:13:07.688
I feel we must know for sure.

185
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.353
You know how good
deeds go.

186
00:13:10.395 --> 00:13:11.771
Weapons have been disabled.

187
00:13:11.813 --> 00:13:14.615
Please send repair crew at
earliest possible convenience.

188
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.335
This is cargo transport
vessel Egulon Nepsis.

189
00:13:17.377 --> 00:13:20.083
It could be us in another life.

190
00:13:20.125 --> 00:13:21.260
We'll see.

191
00:13:21.302 --> 00:13:22.093
Our weapons...

192
00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.902
Mytra. Prepare a boarding craft.

193
00:13:24.944 --> 00:13:27.063
Roger. Prepping the boarding craft.

194
00:13:27.105 --> 00:13:29.335
If it's a trap. we'll make them pay.

195
00:13:29.377 --> 00:13:32.230
That we will. sister. That we will.

196
00:13:32.272 --> 00:13:34.538
"Mytra do this. Mytra do that."

197
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.372
I wanna be in charge!

198
00:13:36.414 --> 00:13:39.647
Mytra. Your radio's still on.

199
00:13:39.689 --> 00:13:40.522
Oh.

200
00:13:42.823 --> 00:13:45.021
This is cargo
transport vessel Egulon Nepsis

201
00:13:45.063 --> 00:13:45.854
reporting heavy damage...

202
00:13:45.896 --> 00:13:48.138
We've got a heavy
cruiser closing in. sir.

203
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.981
Sensors indicate the pirate ship Corsair.

204
00:13:51.023 --> 00:13:53.780
Excellent. Our plan
is coming to fruition.

205
00:13:53.822 --> 00:13:55.696
Prepare to activate the troopers.

206
00:13:55.738 --> 00:13:56.529
Yes sir.

207
00:14:25.119 --> 00:14:28.307
Ready yourselves. vermin.
Prepared to be rescued.

208
00:14:32.465 --> 00:14:34.424
Well. have we seen enough?

209
00:14:38.573 --> 00:14:41.764
It seems your instincts
are not without merit.

210
00:14:47.382 --> 00:14:50.586
Come on
out. we're here to help.

211
00:15:02.343 --> 00:15:04.496
See that? What'd I tell you.

212
00:15:04.538 --> 00:15:07.707
My faith in your
skepticism has been restored.

213
00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:09.329
We better find an exit.

214
00:15:16.437 --> 00:15:17.375
Mytra!

215
00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:36.969
They have defeated our troopers.

216
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:38.753
Activate the weapon!

217
00:15:38.795 --> 00:15:41.532
Weapon activated.

218
00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:45.109
So cold.

219
00:15:46.656 --> 00:15:48.781
Tell my holo-cats I love them.

220
00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.664
Oh. stop it. you got a tiny scratch.

221
00:15:50.706 --> 00:15:52.130
Now get up so we can get outta here.

222
00:16:04.918 --> 00:16:08.738
I am peacekeeper. Prototype Exoria One.

223
00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.967
I have been tasked with your apprehension.

224
00:16:11.009 --> 00:16:13.505
Yeah sister. that's just
not gonna work out for you.

225
00:16:13.547 --> 00:16:16.245
Deactivate yourselves immediately

226
00:16:16.287 --> 00:16:19.094
and you will not be harmed.

227
00:16:40.844 --> 00:16:43.633
No. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no. no. no!

228
00:16:43.675 --> 00:16:47.570
Whoa!

229
00:16:55.445 --> 00:16:57.573
Is that all you've
got? You wait till I get my-

230
00:17:03.573 --> 00:17:07.767
I have a red cat. a
blue cat. a purple one.

231
00:17:09.083 --> 00:17:12.605
I've got a silver one too. and a gray one.

232
00:17:23.195 --> 00:17:25.931
Will the defendants please step forward.

233
00:17:25.973 --> 00:17:28.725
Blow it out
your gasket. lead head.

234
00:17:28.767 --> 00:17:30.686
We are not who you think we are.

235
00:17:30.728 --> 00:17:33.656
This has all been a
case of mistaken identity.

236
00:17:33.698 --> 00:17:35.653
Where are we?

237
00:17:35.695 --> 00:17:37.050
We. the representatives

238
00:17:37.092 --> 00:17:39.771
of the Third Robot
Empire's justice division.

239
00:17:39.813 --> 00:17:43.066
hereby find you guilty of deep space piracy

240
00:17:43.108 --> 00:17:44.867
and resistance of apprehension.

241
00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:47.016
Wait. don't we get a lawyer?

242
00:17:47.058 --> 00:17:49.614
I am certain their
decision has been made.

243
00:17:49.656 --> 00:17:52.862
We hereby sentence you
to a minimum of 1.000 years

244
00:17:52.904 --> 00:17:57.189
of hard labor in the mining
colonies of Arborus Seven.

245
00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.795
You can hereby kiss my shiny metal-

246
00:18:00.837 --> 00:18:03.545
Aah...

247
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.161
We've got a transmission
coming in from the lead ship.

248
00:18:16.203 --> 00:18:18.444
Put it through.

249
00:18:18.486 --> 00:18:21.053
Lower your defenses. people of Radia.

250
00:18:21.095 --> 00:18:23.842
You no longer possess the Arculon Destroyer

251
00:18:23.884 --> 00:18:25.800
and cannot withstand our attack.

252
00:18:25.842 --> 00:18:27.311
We don't fear you. vultures.

253
00:18:27.353 --> 00:18:30.520
Turn back now before we pulverize you.

254
00:18:34.949 --> 00:18:36.897
I guess you scared them off.

255
00:18:40.634 --> 00:18:43.150
Where are you. Destructivas?

256
00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:57.553
Step off the pad and proceed

257
00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:00.614
toward the assimulation
facility for orientation.

258
00:19:00.656 --> 00:19:01.823
I've got a better idea.

259
00:19:01.865 --> 00:19:02.959
Why don't you give me that staff.

260
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:03.972
so I can shove it up your...

261
00:19:04.014 --> 00:19:05.882
Aah!

262
00:19:05.924 --> 00:19:07.755
We are not here to make trouble.

263
00:19:26.902 --> 00:19:29.039
Krogarr. we've got a
coded transmission coming in

264
00:19:29.081 --> 00:19:31.854
from one of our spies on Arborus Seven.

265
00:19:31.896 --> 00:19:33.285
Put it through.

266
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.966
Captain Krogarr. this is Agent Worlow.

267
00:19:37.008 --> 00:19:39.851
Three inmates just
arrived at Arborus Seven.

268
00:19:39.893 --> 00:19:42.233
They fit the description
of the three warriors

269
00:19:42.275 --> 00:19:45.929
who hijacked the Corsair
several days ago. Over.

270
00:19:45.971 --> 00:19:48.627
Good work Worlow.

271
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:51.494
Prepare to receive extraction details.

272
00:19:54.172 --> 00:19:57.014
You will each be issued plasma blasters

273
00:19:57.056 --> 00:20:02.056
to break down metal ore
infused within the asteroid walls.

274
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.302
A truck and crane unit
will be by periodically

275
00:20:05.344 --> 00:20:08.342
to pick up the products of your labor.

276
00:20:08.384 --> 00:20:11.669
You must meet a daily quota of four tons

277
00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.531
or you will be taken to the furnace.

278
00:20:13.573 --> 00:20:18.043
melted down. and
recycled into patio furniture.

279
00:20:18.085 --> 00:20:21.158
This is our last chance.
No one expects us to attack.

280
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.243
Agreed. We act now.

281
00:20:23.285 --> 00:20:24.661
Wait. what?

282
00:20:24.703 --> 00:20:27.370
Trust me. now is not the time.

283
00:20:28.608 --> 00:20:29.603
What's it to you?

284
00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:33.235
I've got a line on something.
You might be interested.

285
00:20:33.277 --> 00:20:34.578
Better turn around.

286
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.421
What?

287
00:20:41.086 --> 00:20:42.596
Not now.

288
00:20:42.638 --> 00:20:45.077
Remember.

289
00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:48.369
You break the rules. you pay the price.

290
00:21:12.184 --> 00:21:14.723
The Centuries are shielded
against the plasma blasters.

291
00:21:14.765 --> 00:21:16.106
if you're wondering.

292
00:21:16.148 --> 00:21:17.947
You like being a prisoner.
that's your business.

293
00:21:17.989 --> 00:21:20.657
I'm gonna escape or kill myself trying.

294
00:21:20.699 --> 00:21:22.150
In about 30 seconds.

295
00:21:22.192 --> 00:21:24.897
my time as a prisoner will come to an end.

296
00:21:24.939 --> 00:21:28.758
Keep your head down and so will yours.

297
00:21:47.124 --> 00:21:48.041
Here we go.

298
00:22:00.368 --> 00:22:01.486
Let's move.

299
00:22:01.528 --> 00:22:02.742
Where's Azalla?

300
00:22:08.957 --> 00:22:12.393
Return to your work stations immediately!

301
00:22:12.435 --> 00:22:14.559
Or be destroyed!

302
00:22:21.084 --> 00:22:22.617
I've got you. boss.

303
00:22:38.446 --> 00:22:41.086
Initiate self destruct sequence.

304
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:51.303
Mission accomplished. Reel us back in.

305
00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:17.389
We're all on board. Hit the gas.

306
00:23:28.915 --> 00:23:30.926
Get off of me you dolt!

307
00:23:40.034 --> 00:23:41.750
Wilhelm scream!

308
00:23:44.503 --> 00:23:48.553
Oh! What a world. what
a world. what a world.

309
00:24:17.002 --> 00:24:20.657
Ah. these must
be the great warriors

310
00:24:20.699 --> 00:24:22.275
I've heard so much about.

311
00:24:22.317 --> 00:24:25.384
We've seen better days.
What do you want with us?

312
00:24:25.426 --> 00:24:28.509
Straight to the point. I like that.

313
00:24:29.685 --> 00:24:33.671
Several days ago I sent a
group of my best warriors.

314
00:24:33.713 --> 00:24:35.575
or so I thought.

315
00:24:35.617 --> 00:24:39.490
to obtain the device called
the Arculon Destroyer.

316
00:24:39.532 --> 00:24:41.989
We lost all contact with our comrades

317
00:24:42.031 --> 00:24:43.928
and we can only assume

318
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.227
they've either been lost or destroyed.

319
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:51.693
What is this. how do
you say. Arculon Destroyer?

320
00:24:51.735 --> 00:24:53.851
Yeah. what's an Arculon Destroyer?

321
00:24:53.893 --> 00:24:57.200
That's not important right now.

322
00:24:57.242 --> 00:24:59.669
We've tracked its
location to an impound unit

323
00:24:59.711 --> 00:25:00.971
on Taurus Five.

324
00:25:01.013 --> 00:25:03.691
An interplanetary justice location.

325
00:25:03.733 --> 00:25:06.293
We need a skilled band of raiders.

326
00:25:06.335 --> 00:25:08.053
such as yourselves.

327
00:25:08.095 --> 00:25:09.487
to break into it.

328
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:13.189
You want us to raid an
outpost? We raid an outpost.

329
00:25:13.231 --> 00:25:14.840
I can't believe our luck.

330
00:25:14.882 --> 00:25:16.285
What are the chances?

331
00:25:16.327 --> 00:25:18.680
He's delivering the Arculon Destroyer

332
00:25:18.722 --> 00:25:20.168
right into our hands.

333
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.318
Better play it cool.

334
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.293
Yeah. this is all very interesting.

335
00:25:23.335 --> 00:25:24.891
What's in it for us?

336
00:25:24.933 --> 00:25:27.606
I can't believe they're falling for this.

337
00:25:27.648 --> 00:25:30.971
I really am
a criminal mastermind.

338
00:25:31.013 --> 00:25:32.754
Better play it cool.

339
00:25:32.796 --> 00:25:35.614
You get an autographed picture of me

340
00:25:35.656 --> 00:25:38.147
and I let you live.

341
00:25:40.934 --> 00:25:43.776
And I'll pay you 600 credits.

342
00:25:44.879 --> 00:25:46.725
If you want us to do heavy lifting.

343
00:25:46.767 --> 00:25:49.948
we will need weapons.

344
00:26:12.628 --> 00:26:13.944
Hey!

345
00:26:35.406 --> 00:26:36.691
An unidentified ship

346
00:26:36.733 --> 00:26:39.184
has just entered the outpost perimeter.

347
00:26:39.226 --> 00:26:41.265
Activate sentries.

348
00:26:50.013 --> 00:26:53.012
We're approaching the drop
zone. Are you ready for launch?

349
00:26:53.054 --> 00:26:54.544
Just get on with it.

350
00:27:15.115 --> 00:27:16.469
Hello. Worlow.

351
00:27:16.511 --> 00:27:21.100
Have we provided the
distraction you've been looking for?

352
00:27:21.142 --> 00:27:22.284
I'm all clear.

353
00:27:22.326 --> 00:27:25.171
Moving towards the impound as we speak.

354
00:27:39.092 --> 00:27:41.127
This isn't the impound.

355
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.844
Sorry to do this to you.

356
00:27:48.886 --> 00:27:51.399
but the impound was too heavily guarded

357
00:27:51.441 --> 00:27:55.288
and I needed someone
to distract the patrols.

358
00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:59.016
You have performed your roles
with the greatest enthusiasm.

359
00:27:59.058 --> 00:28:01.405
Please feel free to keep the docking ship

360
00:28:01.447 --> 00:28:04.859
and as many tokens as you can carry.

361
00:28:04.901 --> 00:28:06.609
Krogarr out.

362
00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:07.844
Is trap?

363
00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:10.355
We were decoys the whole time.

364
00:28:19.174 --> 00:28:22.113
Please
enter the correct ignition code.

365
00:28:22.155 --> 00:28:23.761
I did enter the correct code.

366
00:28:23.803 --> 00:28:25.922
Mothership has departed.

367
00:28:25.964 --> 00:28:27.634
Ugh. we've been had!

368
00:29:10.685 --> 00:29:14.115
I am peacekeeper prototype Exoria Two.

369
00:29:14.157 --> 00:29:16.950
I have been tasked with your apprehension.

370
00:29:16.992 --> 00:29:19.294
Deactivate yourselves immediately

371
00:29:19.336 --> 00:29:20.849
and you will not be harmed.

372
00:29:20.891 --> 00:29:22.891
Ugh. Here we go again!

373
00:29:41.938 --> 00:29:45.103
We need some sort
of magnetic vacuum cleaner.

374
00:30:00.868 --> 00:30:04.698
This is peacekeeper prototype Exoria Two

375
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.323
requesting back uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh...

376
00:30:11.262 --> 00:30:13.429
Help me! Help me! Help me!

377
00:30:21.738 --> 00:30:23.000
Let's get out of here.

378
00:30:29.659 --> 00:30:32.624
Engine requires maintenance.

379
00:30:32.666 --> 00:30:35.083
Come on. Don't cut out now.

380
00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:03.435
The Corsair has been
located and retrieved. Krogarr.

381
00:31:03.477 --> 00:31:05.998
En route to docking as we speak.

382
00:31:35.299 --> 00:31:37.187
It's a teleportation platform.

383
00:31:37.229 --> 00:31:38.896
Yes. But to where?

384
00:31:43.262 --> 00:31:44.679
Let's find out.

385
00:31:54.314 --> 00:31:55.672
Oh. no.

386
00:31:55.714 --> 00:31:58.926
Will the defendants please step forward?

387
00:31:58.968 --> 00:32:00.547
How about I step
forward. remove your head.

388
00:32:00.589 --> 00:32:01.380
and shove it up your-

389
00:32:01.422 --> 00:32:06.146
You have been accused of
prison escape. illegal recycling.

390
00:32:06.188 --> 00:32:08.912
breaking and entering. piracy.

391
00:32:08.954 --> 00:32:11.929
and destruction of private property.

392
00:32:11.971 --> 00:32:14.542
You forgot the murder
of three public officials.

393
00:32:14.584 --> 00:32:15.583
Good one.

394
00:32:15.625 --> 00:32:16.873
Don't help them.

395
00:32:16.915 --> 00:32:19.676
You have been sentenced
to serve out the remainder

396
00:32:19.718 --> 00:32:22.753
of your existence on the
inter-dimensional prison

397
00:32:22.795 --> 00:32:25.508
planetoid of Interprison.

398
00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:30.268
May the great programmer
have mercy on your circuits.

399
00:32:31.614 --> 00:32:33.228
Someone should have mercy on your ugly-

400
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.361
Aah...

401
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:04.006
Surrender now. people of Radia.

402
00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:06.470
And we promise to only torture three-thirds

403
00:33:06.512 --> 00:33:08.661
of the left sides of your bodies

404
00:33:08.703 --> 00:33:12.422
and four-quarters of your right side.

405
00:33:12.464 --> 00:33:13.489
The force field generators

406
00:33:13.531 --> 00:33:17.908
can't withstand this
bombardment for much longer.

407
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:21.033
We may need to contemplate surrender.

408
00:33:23.403 --> 00:33:25.881
Where are you. Destructivas?

409
00:33:35.961 --> 00:33:37.715
What is this place?

410
00:33:37.757 --> 00:33:40.681
We appear to be inside
an artificial planetoid

411
00:33:40.723 --> 00:33:42.593
in a pocket dimension.

412
00:33:42.635 --> 00:33:45.713
If so. the skies would be impenetrable.

413
00:33:49.436 --> 00:33:52.142
It appears we are not alone.

414
00:34:25.797 --> 00:34:26.640
Get in quick!

415
00:34:26.682 --> 00:34:28.953
This place is gonna be
swarming with berzerkers

416
00:34:28.995 --> 00:34:30.245
any second now!

417
00:34:51.339 --> 00:34:52.422
All aboard!

418
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.560
They made it back. Lower the drawbridge.

419
00:35:58.799 --> 00:35:59.632
Uh oh.

420
00:36:02.102 --> 00:36:05.922
Ah. You answered that
distress signal. didn't ya?

421
00:36:06.965 --> 00:36:08.557
Any way off this rock?

422
00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:10.670
Unfortunately this planet has been placed

423
00:36:10.712 --> 00:36:12.181
in a pocket dimension.

424
00:36:12.223 --> 00:36:14.644
There's no conventional way of escape.

425
00:36:14.686 --> 00:36:15.552
Lucky for us.

426
00:36:15.594 --> 00:36:18.568
Strobo built that time machine over there.

427
00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.032
Thank you. Max.

428
00:36:20.074 --> 00:36:21.269
While you're at it.

429
00:36:21.311 --> 00:36:23.302
why don't you just give
'em the launch codes

430
00:36:23.344 --> 00:36:27.286
so they can steal it and
leave us here stranded.

431
00:36:29.489 --> 00:36:30.280
Look.

432
00:36:30.322 --> 00:36:31.533
We'd take you with us.

433
00:36:31.575 --> 00:36:35.333
but we only have enough
time crystals for the four of us.

434
00:36:35.375 --> 00:36:39.899
We'll leave you the karaoke
machine in case you get bored.

435
00:36:39.941 --> 00:36:44.941
♪ Ahoo hey-eh-eh-eh ♪

436
00:36:47.402 --> 00:36:50.256
This. this is unfortunate.

437
00:36:50.298 --> 00:36:52.441
The fate of the universe is at stake

438
00:36:52.483 --> 00:36:54.147
and we are trapped here.

439
00:36:54.189 --> 00:36:55.681
The poor Radians.

440
00:36:57.098 --> 00:37:00.468
Left defenseless against
the scourges of the galaxy.

441
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:03.089
While that mad man
Krogarr roams the galaxy

442
00:37:03.131 --> 00:37:04.816
with a doomsday weapon.

443
00:37:04.858 --> 00:37:08.338
Yeah. Strobo! Have some compassion. man.

444
00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.714
Strobo mean.

445
00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.944
Yeah. Strobo. You're just mean.

446
00:37:12.986 --> 00:37:15.210
Mean. man. Selfish.

447
00:37:15.252 --> 00:37:18.272
All right. already! I'll do what I can.

448
00:37:18.314 --> 00:37:19.653
Who wants to go out there with me

449
00:37:19.695 --> 00:37:22.080
and find some more time crystals?

450
00:37:24.163 --> 00:37:26.976
All right. you guys hold down the fort

451
00:37:27.018 --> 00:37:30.691
and you all don't even think
about using your feminine wiles

452
00:37:30.733 --> 00:37:33.272
to extract the codes from these bumpkins.

453
00:37:33.314 --> 00:37:35.231
They've got years of...

454
00:37:37.376 --> 00:37:38.668
No they don't.

455
00:38:22.046 --> 00:38:23.379
Trog ticklish.

456
00:38:28.189 --> 00:38:29.856
Now Trog tickle you.

457
00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:40.139
Try not to be distracted by
my sensuous movements. Auto.

458
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:41.937
I know what you're trying to do. Luna.

459
00:38:41.979 --> 00:38:45.065
I am like the Alturian devil snake. no?

460
00:38:45.107 --> 00:38:46.151
It's not gonna work.

461
00:38:46.193 --> 00:38:48.281
My mind's like a box of concrete.

462
00:38:48.323 --> 00:38:50.964
Nothing's getting in or out.

463
00:38:57.135 --> 00:39:00.229
Oh yeah. a little to the right.

464
00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:03.983
No offense. but Trog
better at this than you.

465
00:39:04.025 --> 00:39:06.675
Yeah. less talk more drumming. pal.

466
00:39:06.717 --> 00:39:09.800
"Whoa. whoa. what are we gonna do?"

467
00:39:14.396 --> 00:39:19.396
It's me. Max.
here to save your butts again.

468
00:39:20.569 --> 00:39:22.735
The protector of the universe.

469
00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:26.031
"Oh. Max. you saved us again!"

470
00:39:26.073 --> 00:39:30.085
I know. It's what I do.

471
00:39:30.127 --> 00:39:32.254
"Oh. how are you so awesome?"

472
00:39:32.296 --> 00:39:37.296
I don't know. I just am.

473
00:39:38.132 --> 00:39:39.130
"I love you. Max!"

474
00:39:39.172 --> 00:39:42.902
I know.

475
00:39:45.014 --> 00:39:46.931
"Wait. don't leave us!"

476
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:50.483
I'm back! I'm back again.

477
00:39:50.525 --> 00:39:52.022
To protect the universe.

478
00:39:52.064 --> 00:39:53.871
"Oh. we love you. Max."

479
00:39:53.913 --> 00:39:58.543
I know.
but I can't stay here for long.

480
00:39:58.585 --> 00:40:01.835
Sorry. I gotta save the universe again!

481
00:40:02.904 --> 00:40:05.972
"We love you Max!"

482
00:40:06.014 --> 00:40:11.014
"I wish you could stay!"

483
00:40:11.711 --> 00:40:14.884
Hello. Max. What are you doing?

484
00:40:14.926 --> 00:40:16.751
Playing with my toys.

485
00:40:16.793 --> 00:40:18.626
Ooh. Can I play too?

486
00:40:20.286 --> 00:40:21.119
Sure.

487
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:23.639
Hey. look at me.

488
00:40:23.681 --> 00:40:25.738
I'm an innocent little robot girl.

489
00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:28.787
trapped on a planet with no way to escape.

490
00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:31.987
If we only had the launch
codes to the time machine!

491
00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:34.915
Mmm. Tell me the launch codes. Max.

492
00:40:34.957 --> 00:40:37.930
What's that? You ate all of the donuts?

493
00:40:37.972 --> 00:40:40.218
This relationship is over.

494
00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.858
Save your tears for someone else.

495
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.492
Oh. I can't stay mad at you.

496
00:40:45.534 --> 00:40:48.990
Mmm.

497
00:41:10.189 --> 00:41:12.943
Hmm. That looks familiar.

498
00:41:19.307 --> 00:41:21.457
Bunch of bull slag.

499
00:41:58.195 --> 00:42:03.195
1 8 9 7 3 2 4 8.

500
00:42:03.529 --> 00:42:06.070
Well that wasn't too
hard. Everybody buckled up?

501
00:42:06.112 --> 00:42:08.294
They are a curious lot.

502
00:42:08.336 --> 00:42:11.695
I detect a small pang. Is this guilt?

503
00:42:11.737 --> 00:42:13.265
Sure. a little bit.

504
00:42:13.307 --> 00:42:15.828
Maybe we wait till Strobo returns.

505
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:19.022
We all leave together
like big happy family.

506
00:42:19.064 --> 00:42:20.923
Nah. let's just go.

507
00:42:20.965 --> 00:42:22.582
Yeah. let's go.

508
00:42:22.624 --> 00:42:24.377
Yes. they will understand.

509
00:43:25.949 --> 00:43:26.939
Alright.

510
00:43:26.981 --> 00:43:28.573
It was a harrowing adventure.

511
00:43:28.615 --> 00:43:32.444
but I managed to find
some more time crystal...

512
00:43:32.486 --> 00:43:33.563
All right.

513
00:43:33.605 --> 00:43:35.495
Who gave away the launch codes?

514
00:43:35.537 --> 00:43:36.865
Ha ha!

515
00:43:36.907 --> 00:43:39.356
Hey. where'd they go?

516
00:43:39.398 --> 00:43:42.023
Max! I should have known.

517
00:43:48.634 --> 00:43:50.443
Et tu. Auto.

518
00:43:50.485 --> 00:43:52.520
Seems like Trog and I are the only ones

519
00:43:52.562 --> 00:43:56.934
pulling our weight in
this glorious operation.

520
00:43:56.976 --> 00:43:59.740
Trog ready to leave dopey friends behind

521
00:43:59.782 --> 00:44:01.615
with great enthusiasm.

522
00:44:02.733 --> 00:44:04.316
Where the girls at?

523
00:44:06.412 --> 00:44:09.782
Well at least we got the karaoke machine.

524
00:44:09.824 --> 00:44:13.196
Well. nevermind. That's gone too.

525
00:44:13.238 --> 00:44:15.613
Hmm.

526
00:44:48.402 --> 00:44:49.985
Uh. Where are we?

527
00:45:01.475 --> 00:45:03.814
We've gone back to
the time of the initial raid.

528
00:45:03.856 --> 00:45:06.181
They've just stolen the Arculon Destroyer.

529
00:45:06.223 --> 00:45:07.776
We can strike now and return the Arculon

530
00:45:07.818 --> 00:45:09.513
before any of this happens.

531
00:45:09.555 --> 00:45:12.539
It won't work. How
would we exist right now?

532
00:45:12.581 --> 00:45:14.608
They would have no reason to wake us up.

533
00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:16.098
You're thinking about this too much.

534
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.274
In gold-coated
plastic for years to come.

535
00:45:19.316 --> 00:45:20.839
Better find a good place to hide it.

536
00:45:20.881 --> 00:45:24.196
in case we get boarded by
the interplanetary goon squad.

537
00:45:24.238 --> 00:45:25.561
Yeah. I'll just tuck it away

538
00:45:25.603 --> 00:45:27.903
in one of these junkers over here.

539
00:45:27.945 --> 00:45:29.236
Gonna have to talk to Krogarr

540
00:45:29.278 --> 00:45:32.315
about using our ship... Hide!

541
00:45:32.357 --> 00:45:35.737
You think if we sold this
for scrap. he would notice?

542
00:45:35.779 --> 00:45:37.118
If you know Krogarr.

543
00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.353
he's got inventory on everything.

544
00:45:57.730 --> 00:45:59.974
Yeah. I hear ya.

545
00:46:22.291 --> 00:46:25.870
Trog. I'm starting to
believe this ship is haunted.

546
00:46:25.912 --> 00:46:27.831
That or we're gonna have
to start overhauling the wiring

547
00:46:27.873 --> 00:46:31.607
on this jalopy.

548
00:46:59.704 --> 00:47:03.454
Hmm. Must have picked
up some space ghosts.

549
00:47:22.227 --> 00:47:26.594
Whoa! Yeah! Finally making some gains!

550
00:47:29.137 --> 00:47:31.106
Whoa!

551
00:47:31.148 --> 00:47:32.880
Ah! I think there's something wrong

552
00:47:32.922 --> 00:47:35.048
with the artificial gravity.

553
00:47:38.287 --> 00:47:41.704
Oh. I'm think I'm gonna be sore tomorrow.

554
00:48:08.183 --> 00:48:09.891
Haunted.

555
00:48:09.933 --> 00:48:11.127
Ghosts.

556
00:48:11.169 --> 00:48:15.030
Come on. we'll squeeze
through the service tube!

557
00:48:19.358 --> 00:48:21.891
All right. everybody
just settle down now.

558
00:48:24.503 --> 00:48:26.076
Where is the Arculon?

559
00:48:26.118 --> 00:48:28.326
Gone. We delivered it yesterday.

560
00:48:29.294 --> 00:48:32.484
Wrong! We traced the signal.

561
00:49:05.728 --> 00:49:07.453
You'll never find it on this ship.

562
00:49:07.495 --> 00:49:09.272
I hid it good. Ha!

563
00:49:09.314 --> 00:49:10.916
Found it.

564
00:49:32.259 --> 00:49:34.716
This is cargo
transport vessel Egulon Nepsis

565
00:49:34.758 --> 00:49:36.085
reporting heavy damage.

566
00:49:36.127 --> 00:49:38.565
Reactor core has ruptured.
Engines are inoperative.

567
00:49:38.607 --> 00:49:40.184
Our weapons have been disabled.

568
00:49:40.226 --> 00:49:41.746
Please send repair crew

569
00:49:41.788 --> 00:49:44.484
at the earliest possible convenience.

570
00:49:44.526 --> 00:49:46.759
Ah. How young we were.

571
00:49:46.801 --> 00:49:48.258
And naive.

572
00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:51.853
Many lessons we have learned.

573
00:50:06.068 --> 00:50:07.938
The
ship appears to empty.

574
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:10.323
Make sure you check the cargo bay.

575
00:50:14.479 --> 00:50:17.508
Whoa. easy. The gravity is all wonky.

576
00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:18.940
Place is haunted.

577
00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:00.798
Looks like we've got some time to kill.

578
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:01.968
Any suggestions?

579
00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:03.738
We might as well help our past selves

580
00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:05.207
in their futile escape.

581
00:52:08.211 --> 00:52:11.272
Engine requires maintenance.

582
00:52:11.314 --> 00:52:13.731
Come on. don't cut out now.

583
00:52:22.492 --> 00:52:26.279
This is peacekeeper prototype Exoria Two

584
00:52:26.321 --> 00:52:29.821
requesting back uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh...

585
00:52:33.041 --> 00:52:35.208
Help me! Help me! Help me!

586
00:52:43.329 --> 00:52:45.003
Let's get outta here.

587
00:52:56.715 --> 00:52:57.548
Help me!

588
00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:54.108
We've safely entered hyperspace. Krogarr.

589
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:55.458
There are no ships in pursuit.

590
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.598
Excellent.

591
00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.718
I'll be down in the
docking bay. Hold my calls.

592
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.213
We've got a transmission
coming in from Mohana.

593
00:54:02.255 --> 00:54:03.255
Should we ignore it?

594
00:54:04.453 --> 00:54:06.573
Put him through.

595
00:54:10.375 --> 00:54:11.166
Krogarr!

596
00:54:11.208 --> 00:54:13.668
It's been a long time. my old friend.

597
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:15.468
I've heard chatter amongst the stars

598
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:18.708
that you've raided a
certain little outpost?

599
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:20.028
Well. yes.

600
00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:21.288
And would you believe it?

601
00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:24.558
We've managed to carry
away all 6 billion tokens

602
00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.587
that we owe you.

603
00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:26.568
Krogarr.

604
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:30.498
I never doubted you for
more than a few millennia.

605
00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.688
I'll have my minions
transmit the coordinates

606
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:34.338
for our rendezvous.

607
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:38.568
May the solar winds guide
your way. et cetera. et cetera.

608
00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:40.214
Whatever. Just bring me my stuff.

609
00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:58.515
Well there it is.

610
00:54:58.557 --> 00:55:01.233
The infamous Arculon Destroyer.

611
00:55:02.259 --> 00:55:04.308
You know how to work this thing?

612
00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:07.218
If it's galactic domination you desire.

613
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:10.780
then by pushing the big
red button. you will acquire.

614
00:55:39.601 --> 00:55:41.238
I'm not picking up
anything on the sensors.

615
00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.318
Are you sure they're coming?

616
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.518
They'll be here.

617
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.764
I owe that goon a lot of money.

618
00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:14.253
I knew they wouldn't disappoint.

619
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.883
Prepare the Arculon Destroyer.

620
00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:41.996
Open up a channel.

621
00:56:42.038 --> 00:56:43.518
Krogarr.

622
00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:47.343
For once in my many
lives. I'm happy to see you!

623
00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:49.968
Now. Mohana.

624
00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:54.048
I confess. I may have
exaggerated a little bit

625
00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:56.418
on the 6 billion tokens.

626
00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:01.053
You dare to hoodwink the
great and powerful Mohana!

627
00:57:02.182 --> 00:57:04.458
Give me one reason not to blast you

628
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.888
into radioactive space dust.

629
00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:09.048
You deceitful charlatan!

630
00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:12.888
Now Mohana. I know
we've had our differences.

631
00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:16.308
I've defaulted on a few loans. yes.

632
00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:21.078
I may or may not have destroyed
some of your space stations.

633
00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:22.998
and I assure you.

634
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.479
had I known they were
your space stations...

635
00:57:26.521 --> 00:57:28.784
Captain Krogarr.

636
00:57:28.826 --> 00:57:31.565
the Arculon Destroyer is ready.

637
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:35.268
You know what Mohana.
I've had it up to here

638
00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:39.078
with your ranting and
raving and complaining.

639
00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:42.348
You knuckle dragging moron.

640
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:46.128
You primitive sub-humanoid being

641
00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:51.170
with your paid escorts and
your sycophantic followers.

642
00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.198
I think it's about time you learned

643
00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.817
who's really the boss around here.

644
00:57:56.859 --> 00:57:58.398
Krogarr!

645
00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.713
There will be no forgiveness.

646
00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:05.891
Activate the Arculon Destroyer.

647
00:58:05.933 --> 00:58:08.367
The Arculon Destroyer?!

648
00:58:08.409 --> 00:58:10.366
How can this be?

649
00:58:34.885 --> 00:58:37.443
♪ Ahoo hey-eh-eh-eh ♪

650
00:58:52.338 --> 00:58:53.171
Oh boy.

651
00:58:55.677 --> 00:58:57.916
Destroy that ship!

652
00:58:57.958 --> 00:59:00.312
Have a nice life. Krogarr.

653
00:59:07.982 --> 00:59:09.623
Whoa. what happened back there?

654
00:59:09.665 --> 00:59:10.456
Ah. who cares?

655
00:59:10.498 --> 00:59:12.498
We've got nothing but
the future ahead of us.

656
00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:16.836
Yes. The boundless freedoms
of our dreams awaits us.

657
00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:27.768
I'll get you. Destructivas.

658
00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:30.900
Somehow. someway. I'll get you.

659
00:59:47.310 --> 00:59:49.908
It appears we may be too late.

660
00:59:49.950 --> 00:59:52.737
Better late than never.
let's get this thing hooked up.

661
01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:12.310
It's time for distraction. no?

662
01:00:15.271 --> 01:00:16.104
Help me!

663
01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:30.288
I am peacekeeper prototype Exoria Two.

664
01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:33.318
I have not been tasked
with your apprehension.

665
01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.718
Deactivate yourselves immediately

666
01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.644
and you will not be harmed.

667
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:44.388
Do yourself a favor and run. little girl.

668
01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:47.018
Events are about to get apocalyptic.

669
01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:58.503
Distraction achieved. Let's go!

670
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:07.818
Mercy.

671
01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.188
There will be no mercy this day.

672
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:12.918
Without your precious Arculon Destroyer.

673
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.088
you're nothing but fodder

674
01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:16.722
for my hoards of barbarous warriors.

675
01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:24.790
Who dares interrupt
my poetic pontifications.

676
01:01:28.881 --> 01:01:31.072
Um. I give up. I was just leaving.

677
01:01:31.114 --> 01:01:35.049
Thank you.

678
01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:36.708
Uh. I have an announcement to make!

679
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:38.739
They have the Arculon Destroyer.

680
01:01:38.781 --> 01:01:40.371
Run for your lives!

681
01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.595
You have done well. Destructivas.

682
01:02:02.637 --> 01:02:05.208
But your story is not over yet.

683
01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:06.584
You got your weapon back.

684
01:02:06.626 --> 01:02:08.451
now return us to our dream world.

685
01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.643
All right. what's going on?

686
01:02:15.714 --> 01:02:18.783
I'm
gonna go look for a broom.

687
01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:23.268
You're not the only
ones with a time machine.

688
01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:26.088
We traveled back in time 10.000 years.

689
01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:27.948
introduced the Arculon Destroyer.

690
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:30.918
and brought peace in
this once war-torn world.

691
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.318
Just to see the looks on your faces.

692
01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.328
And to be honest. I'm
a little disappointed.

693
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:39.693
10.000 years! Poker faces.

694
01:02:39.735 --> 01:02:41.101
Now. if you don't mind.

695
01:02:41.143 --> 01:02:43.068
We can get 600 coupons

696
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:46.338
for delivering this bad boy to Krogarr.

697
01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:48.296
So step aside.

698
01:02:48.338 --> 01:02:50.568
Well.
you better go back in time

699
01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:52.908
to about 10 hours ago.

700
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:55.600
'Cause Krogarr is now a dead-garr.

701
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:01.308
Surprise!

702
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:04.698
I'm back. baby.

703
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.218
Thought you could pull
one over on me. did ya?

704
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.318
Back away from that Arculon Destroyer

705
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.277
or I'll fry your circuits.

706
01:03:11.319 --> 01:03:13.092
Bite me. Krogarr.

707
01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:26.073
To enter the gates of
enlightenment. you must choose.

708
01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:31.340
The all-seeing heart of love.

709
01:03:31.382 --> 01:03:35.423
or the chainsaw of destruction.

710
01:03:37.744 --> 01:03:39.366
What are you doing in my dream?

711
01:03:39.408 --> 01:03:42.033
We're here to help you choose.

712
01:03:42.075 --> 01:03:44.945
This is an important decision.

713
01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:45.820
Hmm.

714
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:49.278
I built my whole life around this moment.

715
01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.038
Now that I have the Arculon Destroyer.

716
01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.988
I can destroy my enemies

717
01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:59.030
and anyone else who gets
in my way.

718
01:04:00.312 --> 01:04:02.358
Wait. Are we still getting paid?

719
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.708
Are you kidding me?

720
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:06.108
You idiots are the worst bunch of criminals

721
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:09.498
I've ever had the
displeasure of working with.

722
01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:12.526
I'll buy you a slice of
pizza. but nothing more.

723
01:04:12.568 --> 01:04:13.359
That's fair.

724
01:04:13.401 --> 01:04:14.337
I like pizza. - That's fair.

725
01:04:14.379 --> 01:04:16.200
- I like pizza.
- I love pizza!

726
01:04:25.345 --> 01:04:26.808
Foolish mortals.

727
01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:29.808
You cannot stop the
architects of annihilation.

728
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:33.288
The executors of extinction.

729
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:36.048
Bow down before your destroyers.

730
01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:37.523
Or be

731
01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.188
destroyed.

732
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:42.108
Not so fast. Mohana.

733
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:44.808
Take one more step and I push this button.

734
01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:48.198
Your threats mean nothing to me. Krogarr.

735
01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.998
Now put down that toy.

736
01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.798
And eliminate yourself.

737
01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.404
so I may refrain from lifting my arms.

738
01:04:55.446 --> 01:04:57.195
Easy. Krogarr.

739
01:04:57.237 --> 01:05:00.258
you have no idea the power
you're about to unleash.

740
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.808
Yeah. man. That thing's
hotter than a supernova.

741
01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:04.354
Don't push it.

742
01:05:04.396 --> 01:05:05.391
Push it!

743
01:05:05.433 --> 01:05:08.808
No. don't push it. Push it! Yeah!

744
01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:11.388
Trust has led to much chaos.

745
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:13.188
Maybe chainsaw would be best.

746
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:16.668
Trust isn't such a
bad thing. I trust you.

747
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:18.063
Sometimes it works out.

748
01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.534
You guys aren't helping much.

749
01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:40.193
I can't believe I'm saying this.

750
01:05:40.235 --> 01:05:42.258
but can everyone just relax for a second?

751
01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.823
She's right. Everyone relax.

752
01:05:44.865 --> 01:05:45.698
Nah!

753
01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:47.928
Look. a few minutes ago.

754
01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:49.998
I'd be the first person
to split a head open

755
01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:50.868
or chop an arm off.

756
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:53.260
But I think right now
we need to use our heads.

757
01:05:54.330 --> 01:05:56.388
I can't help but think we've
been drawn here together

758
01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:57.588
for a reason.

759
01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:59.838
That we're meant for something bigger.

760
01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.578
We have to figure this out.

761
01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:04.901
And not with our fists.
but with our brains.

762
01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.783
Our computers.

763
01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:08.943
our hearts.

764
01:06:10.830 --> 01:06:14.533
Our hearts.

765
01:06:17.031 --> 01:06:18.724

force in the universe.

And what is music?

777
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.417

I can't even
believe that. What the hell?

785
01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:40.784
I'm sorry. But "bosh" is not a word.

786
01:09:40.826 --> 01:09:42.438
Oh wait. wait. They're telling me...

787
01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.628
