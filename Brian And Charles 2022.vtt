That's what I always say.

183
00:13:03.452 --> 00:13:06.222
And then that door closes
and another door opens.

184

And then that door closes
and another door opens.

185

And that-that door will
probably close at some point.

186

another one will hopefully open.

187
00:13:17.532 --> 00:13:21.875

at some point along the line.

188
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.339
then that door will close.

189
00:13:24.374 --> 00:13:27.738

fingers crossed. another...

356
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.625
-My name is Charles Petrescu.
-Yeah.

357
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.187
Already said that.

358
00:24:15.222 --> 00:24:16.760
Yeah.

359
00:24:16.795 --> 00:24:19.290
-And you built my body.
-And I built your body.

It's not all lovely.

369

sometimes.

370

- able or likely
to cause harm or injury.

371
00:24:51.159 --> 00:24:52.356

at the tree?

382
00:25:17.922 --> 00:25:21.088
Oh. no. no. no. no. no. no. no.
it goes way beyond the tree.

383

It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

390
00:25:32.167 --> 00:25:33.936
-Perilous. So very perilous.
-Just birds. Just birds.

391
00:25:33.971 --> 00:25:35.168
Just crows.

392
00:25:35.203 --> 00:25:36.609

393

Don't know. Probably getting
some worms or something.

what would happen.

710
00:40:05.545 --> 00:40:06.907
What?

711
00:40:06.942 --> 00:40:09.305
- I read about it
in a sports magazine.

712
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.483
What sports magazine?

713
00:40:13.685 --> 00:40:15.685
Grub's up. There you go.

714
00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.918
-Grub's... Grub's up.
-Grub's up.

715
00:40:17.953 --> 00:40:19.051
There you go.

716
00:40:19.086 --> 00:40:21.526
Nice. big cabbage.

717
00:40:23.387 --> 00:40:25.497
You watching telly?

718
00:40:25.532 --> 00:40:26.993
Telly.

719
00:40:27.028 --> 00:40:29.666
Plural noun: tellies.

720
00:40:29.701 --> 00:40:32.163
Another term for television.

721
00:40:32.198 --> 00:40:35.573
- There has been
a cowboy film on telly.

722
00:40:35.608 --> 00:40:37.872

I've got to say.
I'm enjoying this magic moment.

724
00:40:42.208 --> 00:40:44.912
Good. I'm glad you are.

725
00:40:44.947 --> 00:40:47.277
I've done you some
sponge fingers for afterwards.

726
00:40:47.312 --> 00:40:48.784
Yumsville.

727
00:40:48.819 --> 00:40:50.786
But first. a destination
that for years

728
00:40:50.821 --> 00:40:53.382
has been synonymous
with exotic travel.

729
00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:55.758
Honolulu in Hawaii.

730
00:40:55.793 --> 00:40:59.157
Now. there is so much to do
in Honolulu.

731
00:40:59.192 --> 00:41:00.598
Everything from snorkeling to...

732
00:41:00.633 --> 00:41:02.292
Where is that. please?

733
00:41:02.327 --> 00:41:04.327
...horseback riding
to helicopter tours.

734
00:41:04.362 --> 00:41:06.131
it really is the perfect place

735
00:41:06.166 --> 00:41:08.639

736
00:41:08.674 --> 00:41:10.201
-Where. Brian?
-- Honolulu.

737
00:41:10.236 --> 00:41:12.808
Put your head down
while you have your dinner.

738
00:41:12.843 --> 00:41:14.579
In tropical Honolulu...

739
00:41:14.614 --> 00:41:16.845
What is it called again. please?

740
00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.979
Honolulu.

741
00:41:19.014 --> 00:41:21.212
-Hunna-loy-loy.
-No.

742
00:41:21.247 --> 00:41:22.510
Honolulu.

-Honey-lay-lay.

744
00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:25.821
It's Honolulu.

Hono-loop-loop.

746
00:41:31.763 --> 00:41:33.158
What are you doing?

747
00:41:33.193 --> 00:41:34.665
Let's go there. Brian.

748
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.701
It's hotter than here.
and it looks wonderful.

749
00:41:37.736 --> 00:41:40.803
Will you sit down. please?

750
00:41:41.674 --> 00:41:43.938
I want to go to Hono-la-la.

751
00:41:43.973 --> 00:41:46.644
Not now. you don't.
You're having your dinner.

752
00:41:46.679 --> 00:41:48.371
Horses and helicopters. please.

753
00:41:48.406 --> 00:41:50.582
You sit down
and have your dinner.

754
00:41:50.617 --> 00:41:52.584
-No.
-I beg your pardon?

755
00:41:52.619 --> 00:41:54.718
-I don't want to sit down.
-Charles.

756
00:41:54.753 --> 00:41:56.984
I want to go to Honol.

757
00:41:57.019 --> 00:41:59.481
Can we park
this Honolulu chatter. please.

758
00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:02.319
and sit down and eat our dinner?

759
00:42:03.927 --> 00:42:05.421
So come along and experience...

760
00:42:05.456 --> 00:42:07.159
Okay.

761
00:42:07.194 --> 00:42:08.600
Bossy boots.

762
00:42:08.635 --> 00:42:10.602
Let's see what's on
the other side.

763
00:42:10.637 --> 00:42:12.032
-Best wishes...

764
00:42:12.067 --> 00:42:13.770
HOST
...one and only Gary Barlow!

765
00:42:13.805 --> 00:42:16.608
-Oh. I like him.

766
00:42:33.451 --> 00:42:35.825
- Packet of Ringwald's

00:42:38.665 --> 00:42:41.028
And a cherry and almond
nougat bar.

769
00:42:42.064 --> 00:42:44.394
I see the bonfire's
coming along.

770
00:42:44.429 --> 00:42:46.671
It's a big one this year.

771
00:42:48.334 --> 00:42:50.235
The...?

772
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:52.204
Sorry?

773
00:42:52.239 --> 00:42:54.206
The bonfire?

774
00:42:54.241 --> 00:42:55.570
My bonfire. June.

775
00:42:55.605 --> 00:42:57.781
- Well. I didn't mean
anything by that.

776
00:42:57.816 --> 00:43:00.377
I'm in charge of
the bonfires round here.

777
00:43:00.412 --> 00:43:02.148
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

778
00:43:02.183 --> 00:43:05.921
That's nine pound. uh. 60.
I think. Eddie.

779
00:43:08.024 --> 00:43:12.631
Or. uh. shall I just
put it on your slate?

780
00:43:14.657 --> 00:43:16.294
Yeah.

781
00:43:17.132 --> 00:43:18.835
Yeah. I reckon
you should do that.

782
00:43:25.008 --> 00:43:27.404
What you doing over there?

783
00:43:28.572 --> 00:43:31.749
Browsing around. Browsing.

784
00:43:33.984 --> 00:43:36.820
-Browsing. is it?
-Yeah.

785
00:43:36.855 --> 00:43:38.822
Is there much to browse
in here. is there?

786
00:43:38.857 --> 00:43:41.187
Yeah. This shelf isn't bad.

787
00:43:41.222 --> 00:43:44.388
Sneaking around. uh. with
his little table tennis bat.

788
00:43:44.423 --> 00:43:47.127
Were you playing table tennis
on your own again?

789
00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:50.768
No.

790
00:43:50.803 --> 00:43:52.297
Browsing Away Brian.

791
00:43:52.332 --> 00:43:53.903
Brian the Browser.

792
00:43:53.938 --> 00:43:55.872
That's what they call him.
Well. they used to call him

793
00:43:55.907 --> 00:43:57.533
other things. didn't they?

794
00:43:57.568 --> 00:43:59.843
There you are.

795
00:43:59.878 --> 00:44:01.746
-Whoops.

796
00:44:01.781 --> 00:44:03.781
You should probably pick
those up for June. I reckon.

797
00:44:03.816 --> 00:44:05.409
Yeah. I will do.

798
00:44:07.853 --> 00:44:09.512
- You don't
have to do that. Brian.

799
00:44:09.547 --> 00:44:11.217

Honestly. what are you wearing?

813
00:45:04.976 --> 00:45:06.844
It's my Hawaiian hula skirt.

814
00:45:06.879 --> 00:45:08.978
Oh. you're being daft.
You're being daft.

No. no. you're not going
to Hono-loop-loop.

818

-But I want to go.
-Honestly.

823
00:45:26.756 --> 00:45:28.690
Why won't you let me go. Brian?

824
00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:30.560
I want to dance on the beach.

825
00:45:30.595 --> 00:45:32.100
It's miles away.

826
00:45:32.135 --> 00:45:34.531
I know. That's why I want to go.

827
00:45:34.566 --> 00:45:36.335

He said to me last night

Don't talk to me like that.

Yeah. well. I've changed
my mind just this once.

848

-Whatever.
-Don't say "whatever."

853

Why are you wearing that?

I feel pretty cool.

Not in my old curtains.

Okay.

862
00:48:24.373 --> 00:48:25.867
Come on. then.

863
00:48:25.902 --> 00:48:27.737
Are we going to the shops.
Brian?

864
00:48:27.772 --> 00:48:29.211
Yes. we are going to the shops.

865
00:48:29.246 --> 00:48:30.872
Now. do as you're told. okay?

866
00:48:30.907 --> 00:48:32.940
There are some things
that I need.

I'd like a map of the world
for my wall.

869
00:48:36.946 --> 00:48:38.517
Right. okay.
Well. maybe not today.

870
00:48:38.552 --> 00:48:40.453
'cause I've got stuff to do.
but...

871
00:48:40.488 --> 00:48:42.224
And some soap.

872
00:48:42.259 --> 00:48:44.688
-Soap?
-And some cotton socks.

Cotton socks?

874
00:48:46.164 --> 00:48:47.460
And I want to sit
in the front. Brian.

875
00:48:47.495 --> 00:48:49.231
No. you're not sitting
in the front.

876
00:48:49.266 --> 00:48:50.463
You're sitting in the back.
You're not old enough.

877
00:48:50.498 --> 00:48:52.432
I want to go
in the front. Brian.

878
00:48:52.467 --> 00:48:55.204
You're not old enough
to go in the front.

879
00:48:55.239 --> 00:48:57.866
I want you in the back.

880
00:48:57.901 --> 00:49:00.209
-Front.
-Not front.

881
00:49:00.244 --> 00:49:02.211
I will sit in the front. Brian.

882
00:49:02.246 --> 00:49:04.576
You will not sit in the front.
You'll sit in the back.

883
00:49:04.611 --> 00:49:06.974
Maybe I could drive
and you could walk. Brian.

884
00:49:07.009 --> 00:49:10.648
You have got a very.
very cheeky brain.

885
00:49:10.683 --> 00:49:12.782
and I don't like it.

886
00:49:12.817 --> 00:49:14.586
I don't know
what's got into you.

887
00:49:14.621 --> 00:49:18.029
It's the same blue eye
but a different attitude.

888
00:49:18.064 --> 00:49:20.955
A very. very cheeky robot.

889
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:22.396
Cheeky?

890
00:49:22.431 --> 00:49:23.793
Cheeky. yes.

891
00:49:23.828 --> 00:49:26.598
-Cheeky bot.
-Cheeky bot?

892
00:49:27.832 --> 00:49:29.502
Cheeky bot sit
in the front. Brian.

893
00:49:29.537 --> 00:49:31.240
Stop saying "front."

894
00:49:31.275 --> 00:49:33.473
Front. front. front.

895
00:49:33.508 --> 00:49:36.080

-Are we there yet?
-No.

897
00:49:42.187 --> 00:49:44.682
If you're good.
I'll take you to the lake.

898
00:49:44.717 --> 00:49:46.321
-- Lake?
-Yes.

899
00:49:46.356 --> 00:49:48.191
I need to quickly stop
at the shop. okay?

900
00:49:48.226 --> 00:49:50.490
-I'll come as well
and say hello. -No. you won't.

901
00:49:50.525 --> 00:49:53.922
You've got to stay in the truck
and keep your head down.

902
00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:56.826
Can we go to
the swimming pool. Brian?

903
00:49:56.861 --> 00:49:59.433
- Swimming pool?
There is no swimming pool.

904
00:49:59.468 --> 00:50:01.237
Can we go to the airport?

905
00:50:01.272 --> 00:50:03.140
There is no airport.

906
00:50:03.175 --> 00:50:04.933
Can we go to the zoo. Brian?

907
00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:06.473
There is no zoo.

908
00:50:06.508 --> 00:50:09.509
There's a kennels.
That's just dogs.

909
00:50:10.314 --> 00:50:12.809
-- Dogs?
-Yes. dogs.

910
00:50:13.779 --> 00:50:15.350
Right.

911
00:50:15.385 --> 00:50:17.220
I won't be long. okay?

912
00:50:17.255 --> 00:50:20.091
Don't do anything. Right?

913
00:50:53.951 --> 00:50:55.555
Hello.

914
00:50:58.021 --> 00:50:59.988
I am Charles Petrescu.

915
00:51:00.023 --> 00:51:02.100
Who are you. please?

916
00:51:02.894 --> 00:51:04.663
H-Hazel.

917
00:51:04.698 --> 00:51:07.666
Well. it's very nice
to meet you. Hazel.

918
00:51:08.933 --> 00:51:10.834
What. uh...

919
00:51:10.869 --> 00:51:12.209

920
00:51:12.244 --> 00:51:14.904
I am Charles Petrescu.

921
00:51:15.775 --> 00:51:18.413
Do you live in the fields
with the sheep?

922
00:51:18.448 --> 00:51:21.713
No. I live in the village
with my mum and a parrot.

923
00:51:21.748 --> 00:51:26.421
- an exotic jungle bird
known for its flamboyant colors.

924
00:51:26.456 --> 00:51:29.655
Characteristic features include
a strong. curved bill.

925
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:31.591
- Yes. he's green.
and he's got red shoul...

926
00:51:31.626 --> 00:51:35.199
- Did you know
the most important components

927
00:51:35.234 --> 00:51:37.762
of most parrots' diets
are seeds?

928
00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.139
Please don't tell anyone.

929
00:51:42.274 --> 00:51:45.539
-Please.
-I-I won't. I won't.

930
00:51:45.574 --> 00:51:47.101
What is he?

931
00:51:47.136 --> 00:51:48.476
A robot.

932
00:51:48.511 --> 00:51:50.247
I am Charles Petrescu.

933
00:51:50.282 --> 00:51:52.106
Did you build him. Brian?

934
00:51:52.141 --> 00:51:53.844
Yeah.

935
00:51:53.879 --> 00:51:56.451
- We're going
to the lake for a walk.

936
00:51:56.486 --> 00:51:57.881
Oh. I-I'm... I'm sorry.

937
00:51:57.916 --> 00:51:59.454
-I didn't mean to...
-- No. no. no. no.

938
00:51:59.489 --> 00:52:01.148
I'm sorry.
No. we're-we're just going...

939
00:52:01.183 --> 00:52:02.688
we were just going for
a mooch about. Charles.

940
00:52:02.723 --> 00:52:04.525
Is Hazel coming?

941
00:52:07.156 --> 00:52:08.595
No.

942
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:11.092
- You should ask her
to come to the lake.

943
00:52:11.127 --> 00:52:12.698
Very busy.

944
00:52:13.569 --> 00:52:16.163
- She doesn't look
like she is busy.

945
00:52:16.198 --> 00:52:18.605
She'll want to come to the lake.

946
00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.244
Uh...

947
00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:24.809
Do you want to?

948
00:52:24.844 --> 00:52:26.250
Do you want to come?

949
00:52:26.285 --> 00:52:29.550
Well. is that all right?

950
00:52:34.326 --> 00:52:36.392
- How did you know
how to build him?

951
00:52:36.427 --> 00:52:39.153
I wouldn't know where to start.

952
00:52:39.188 --> 00:52:41.529
Don't know.
Just start at the beginning

953
00:52:41.564 --> 00:52:43.696
and use your imagination.
I suppose.

954
00:52:45.194 --> 00:52:47.370
- Would you like a game
of "kick the stone." Brian?

955
00:52:47.405 --> 00:52:49.867
- No. no. no.
I'm talking to Hazel now. okay?

956
00:52:49.902 --> 00:52:51.803
All right?

957
00:52:51.838 --> 00:52:53.508
Oh.

958
00:52:53.543 --> 00:52:55.345
-Sorry.

959
00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:58.447
It's so nice to be out.

960
00:52:58.482 --> 00:53:00.746
I hardly ever see you
around town.

961
00:53:00.781 --> 00:53:02.649
I'm-I'm quite busy.

962
00:53:02.684 --> 00:53:04.255
Yeah. Busy bee.

963
00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:05.586
Busy bee. Busy beaver.

964
00:53:05.621 --> 00:53:08.292
-Busy beaver.

965
00:53:12.694 --> 00:53:14.232

Charles. don't put your...
Sorry.

967
00:53:17.501 --> 00:53:19.402
Charles. don't put your feet
in the water.

968
00:53:19.437 --> 00:53:21.437
I want to swim across the lake

969
00:53:21.472 --> 00:53:23.032
and check out the other side.

-You'd sink.
-I would not.

00:53:26.741 --> 00:53:28.477
You can't go for a swim.

973
00:53:28.512 --> 00:53:30.380
We're going for walkie-walkies.

974
00:53:30.415 --> 00:53:32.349
You and Hazel can do your thing.

975
00:53:32.384 --> 00:53:34.318
-and I'll do my thing.
-No. Come on.

976
00:53:34.353 --> 00:53:35.847
It's not fair.
