3
00:02:09.042 --> 00:02:10.875
Art is supposed to be subjective.

4
00:02:11.292 --> 00:02:14.000
but KingPun's art is subjectively good.

5
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.042
While mine is

6
00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:17.000
objectively struggling.

7
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.208
and at the worst time possible.

8
00:02:19.208 --> 00:02:21.458
Right now. I need to be
on my A-game

9
00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:23.875
to get into
the CalArt Summer Program.

10
00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:25.958
AKA my dream school.

11
00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.667
"Through your medium of choice.
show us your happiest moment."

12
00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:30.917
Are you fucking kidding me?

13
00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.208
What a vague bullshit prompt.

14
00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:34.458
A vague bullshit prompt

15
00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:36.500
that will determine if I have
a shot in hell at getting

16
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.167
into one of the most
competitive schools in the country.

17
00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:42.208
Which will determine if I have
a future in art at all.

18
00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:43.375
No pressure though.

19
00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:46.292
So how do I answer
this impossible question?

20
00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.417
Huh? What if my happiest moment was
when I came out to my mom.

21
00:02:50.417 --> 00:02:51.833
Okay.

22
00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:53.792
Now turn it to the right.

23
00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:56.958
Also I think I'm gay.

24
00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.458
Actually. I know I am.

25
00:02:58.458 --> 00:03:00.792
- Ow! Barbara from next door is gay.

26
00:03:00.792 --> 00:03:01.875
- Okay?

27
00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:04.583
- Sorry my first instinct was
to name other gay people we know.

28
00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:06.667
Honey. I'm so happy for you!

29
00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:08.208
She's always been supportive.

30
00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:10.750
Paige. Paige! Come on.

31
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.417
No edibles before school.
we've talked about this.

32
00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:14.208
Dillon's almost here.
You're gonna be late.

33
00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:16.417
- What if I just skipped
the rest of junior year

34
00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:17.750
and went right to CalArts?

35
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.250
- Well. you could.
but then you wouldn't get

36
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.750
a lot of cool free swag
from me.

37
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.833
- I'm already scared.

38
00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:26.042
- I can't wait. Look.

39
00:03:26.042 --> 00:03:28.667
Glow in the dark dental dams.

40
00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.167
They make your puss kind
of glow. It's so pretty.

41
00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:32.917
It's just a soft glow.
- Mom--

42
00:03:32.917 --> 00:03:34.083
- When I was a teenager.

43
00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:35.750
we used to use
glow in the dark condoms.

44
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.042
It really added a touch of whimsy
to an otherwise fraught situation.

45
00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:40.667
- We don't use those.

46
00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:43.458
- We! Finally.

47
00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:45.542
Oh my gosh. Paige.

48
00:03:45.542 --> 00:03:47.042
Is it Colleen from next door?

49
00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:50.125
Because she's so tall.
I like that. Statuesque.

50
00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:53.958
- It's not anybody because we.
the queer community.

51
00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.125
we don't use those.

52
00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:58.625
- So just vibrators?
Isn't that a little limiting?

53
00:03:59.042 --> 00:04:00.292
- Probably.
- Okay.

54
00:04:00.292 --> 00:04:01.625
I'm gonna put them here

55
00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:03.250
because I feel like
you're gonna change your mind.

56
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.042
but if not. let me know
because I have the receipt.

57
00:04:05.042 --> 00:04:07.167
Okay. maybe she's
a little too supportive.

58
00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:08.458
Hey!

59
00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:11.042
And that would be
my best friend. Dillon.

60
00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.375
He's kind of like
my platonic soul mate.

61
00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:17.500
I've always been able
to share anything with him.

62
00:04:20.042 --> 00:04:22.042
Actually. maybe that was
my happiest moment.

63
00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:24.833
So... I like girls.

64
00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:26.000
- Me too.

65
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.875
I still share everything
with him. Even a Spotify account.

66
00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:31.583
- Hey. yo.
Spotify informed me

67
00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:34.667
you listened to Phoebe Bridgers
for eight hours straight last night.

68
00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:37.292
which is concerning
'cause she only has two albums.

69
00:04:37.292 --> 00:04:38.292
Are you okay?

70
00:04:38.917 --> 00:04:42.167
- Sad lesbian music is
an integral part of my identity.

71
00:04:42.167 --> 00:04:45.875
- So I'm assuming that
the application is not going well.

72
00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:47.875
- Just can't figure out
what to send in.

73
00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:50.708
I know that colleges love
a good coming out story.

74
00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:53.042
- Please don't do that.
You'd be like the billionth gay person to.

75
00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:55.208
How about you draw
my presidential portrait?

76
00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:56.167
- Hmm.

77
00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:58.542
It's a cute idea. Dillon.
- It's good. isn't it?

78
00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:02.000
- But your political ambitions.
they aren't my happiest moment.

79
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.750
You know what I mean?

80
00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:06.792
- You think that your crush on
Gabriela Campos is CalArt worthy?

81
00:05:06.792 --> 00:05:07.875
- What?

82
00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:11.333
Unrequited love is the source
of a lot of great art.

83
00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:12.958
And there's nothing more unrequited

84
00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.083
than my crush
on Gabriela Campos.

85
00:05:17.458 --> 00:05:18.708
That's not Gabby.

86
00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:20.708
That's her sister. AJ.

87
00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.167
- Alright. kids. time for
this week's take home project.

88
00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:27.958
Find a partner.

89
00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:29.667
- Wanna be my partner?

90
00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:30.792
That is Gabby.

91
00:05:30.792 --> 00:05:31.542
Sure.

92
00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:34.917
Now I wanna see you
share responsibilities

93
00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:36.500
like real parents would.

94
00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:37.917
- What should we name it?

95
00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:40.667
- How about Lentil?

96
00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:42.250
- Lentil the egg.

97
00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:43.833
So dumb.

98
00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:45.875
I love it.

99
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.917
- Hi. Lentil.

100
00:05:48.792 --> 00:05:50.333
- Your moms love you very much.

101
00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:54.750
She's kind of the first girl
who made me feel

102
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.708
like life could be as good as art.

103
00:05:56.708 --> 00:05:57.833
You know?

104
00:06:02.083 --> 00:06:02.792
No.

105
00:06:02.792 --> 00:06:05.250
I'm not gonna let you spend
all of high school pining over some girl

106
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.083
who doesn't give you
the time of day.

107
00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:09.292
You know I don't like to assert
my power as class president.

108
00:06:09.292 --> 00:06:10.708
but I'm going to have to
if this keeps up.

109
00:06:10.708 --> 00:06:12.417
- Stacey is going to win.

110
00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:15.292
Also. you do know that
as class president.

111
00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:16.917
you don't have
any actual power. right?

112
00:06:16.917 --> 00:06:18.833
- That is a sad way
to look at democracy.

113
00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:32.875
Alright.

114
00:06:34.375 --> 00:06:35.625
- Holy shit.

115
00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:36.292
- You like?

116
00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:38.583
- "Save water. shower together."

117
00:06:38.583 --> 00:06:40.375
Hmm. That looks so hot.

118
00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:42.583
And Stacey's also really hot.

119
00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:44.208
Great job with these. by the way.

120
00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:45.042
- Thank you.

121
00:06:45.042 --> 00:06:47.250
- Though I do feel like you spent
a little bit more time on Stacey's.

122
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.042
- Nope. Mm-mm.
I told you guys I'm Switzerland.

123
00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:53.500
Oh. Shit. they are also
a little bit wet.

124
00:06:54.417 --> 00:06:56.458
- Thanks for telling me that
after I pick it up.

125
00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:58.167
And yeah. I just close the -

126
00:06:58.167 --> 00:06:58.917
Okay.
- No.

127
00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:00.500
CoÃ±o. Ay.

128
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.500
Anyway. as I was saying.
as your future class president.

129
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.500
I think it's time for you
to move on from Gabriela.

130
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.417
It's too predictable to go
for the most popular girl in school.

131
00:07:09.208 --> 00:07:10.458
Great. Right on cue.

132
00:07:18.292 --> 00:07:19.667
- Is she in slow motion again?
- Yeah.

133
00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:21.333
- Music playing in the background?
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:22.833
- Funny feeling down there?
- Naturally.

135
00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:23.958
- You are a lost cause.

136
00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:28.625
Heads up!

137
00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:30.208
My bad.
- Yeah.

138
00:07:31.167 --> 00:07:32.917
- Let's go. Vamos.

139
00:07:32.917 --> 00:07:34.542
Yeah. ah ah.
Ah ah ah ah.

140
00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:37.917
Shut the hell up.

141
00:07:37.917 --> 00:07:40.083
Starting the week strong
with a new KingPun mural.

142
00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:42.083
You know everyone still thinks
it's you. right?

143
00:07:42.083 --> 00:07:43.167
- Well. little do they know.

144
00:07:43.167 --> 00:07:46.500
my raging anxiety would never
let me deface school property.

145
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.833
- Whoa. could you please
not waste water

146
00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:50.208
and undermine my political platform?

147
00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:51.083
Thank you.

148
00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:53.083
Oh. KingPun did it again!
Check it out!

149
00:07:53.083 --> 00:07:54.792
Kind of think
that this one's good.

150
00:07:54.792 --> 00:07:56.333
- I think it's kind of corny.

151
00:07:56.333 --> 00:07:58.208
- Well. I think that
you can't draw for shit.

152
00:07:58.708 --> 00:08:00.792
And I think that they're
actually talented.

153
00:08:00.792 --> 00:08:03.208
- Oh. you're so funny.

154
00:08:03.208 --> 00:08:05.958
- Okay. everyone.
away from the vandalization.

155
00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.250
- Oh god. Here we go.

156
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.250
- If any of you have any information

157
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.167
as my mother used to say.

158
00:08:11.167 --> 00:08:12.750
"Snitches get riches."

159
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.917
Have you ever seen him smile?

160
00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:16.458
- Once. At a fire drill.

161
00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:18.458
He loved the chaos of it.

162
00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:19.875
- Hey. nice mural. Paige.

163
00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:21.125
Tim. Ugh.

164
00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:23.417
I love this little bit
that we've got going.

165
00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:25.125
but it's not me.

166
00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:26.250
- Oh. Sure. Paige.

167
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.625
- Sure. Tim.

168
00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:29.958
- No. it's. it's definitely her.

169
00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:30.833
Doy.

170
00:08:31.292 --> 00:08:33.208
Hey. KingPun thinks
she's not KingPun.

171
00:08:42.708 --> 00:08:44.250
KingPun is who you should date.

172
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.000
Unless it's a dude
or unless it's you.

173
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.292
'Cause then you'd just be dating yourself.
and that would be weird.

174
00:08:48.292 --> 00:08:49.625
- Hmm.

175
00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:51.750
You have no idea
how hard it is out here

176
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.542
for your everyday gay. Dillon.

177
00:08:53.542 --> 00:08:55.042
- Stop making excuses.

178
00:08:55.042 --> 00:08:57.583
- You've been in a relationship
since the first day of middle school.

179
00:08:57.583 --> 00:09:00.083
Also. this semester.
I'm gonna make my move.

180
00:09:00.083 --> 00:09:01.292
- Oh yeah? Name one time
that you've made a move.

181
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.833
- Oh. there was that server
at Cheesecake Factory

182
00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:04.917
that gave me extra brown bread.

183
00:09:04.917 --> 00:09:05.583
- It was her job.

184
00:09:05.583 --> 00:09:07.417
- It was sexual.
Hey. Stacey.

185
00:09:07.417 --> 00:09:08.583
- Hey.

186
00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:12.000
Did you turn your
class president app in yet?

187
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.333
You know I love some competition.

188
00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:15.875
- Oh. you know I haven't missed
a deadline since the fifth grade.

189
00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:19.292
And that was only because
I had severe chicken pox.

190
00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:20.750
It was the worst case I'd ever seen.

191
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.500
- How is this allowed in school?

192
00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:27.875
- God. I love when you're
the best at things.

193
00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:29.000
- Oh yeah?

194
00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:33.417
- You guys are so straight.
it's almost gay.

195
00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:36.208
Do you guys wanna come over
after school

196
00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:38.333
and take edibles
and watch Shrek?

197
00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:41.208
- So you could convince yourself
that a CBD dog treat made you high again?

198
00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:42.375
Yeah. No. thank you.

199
00:09:42.375 --> 00:09:44.792
- Plus. after school we can't.
we have track tryouts.

200
00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:47.333
- Ugh. Why would you sweat
when you don't have to?

201
00:09:47.333 --> 00:09:49.708
- Well. you know. Paige. some people
actually enjoy physical activity.

202
00:09:49.708 --> 00:09:51.042
Shocking. I know.

203
00:09:51.042 --> 00:09:52.917
Will you help me make more of these?
Sure.

204
00:09:52.917 --> 00:09:54.000
- And me some of these.

205
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.125
The impending water wars
depend on my win.

206
00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:58.542
Note that I took the high road
while taking down the establishment.

207
00:09:58.542 --> 00:10:00.000
That is so...

208
00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.833
No-- Oh no.
Okay. no. no.

209
00:10:03.833 --> 00:10:05.792
No. no. no. no.
Okay. no.

210
00:10:05.792 --> 00:10:07.292
There are plenty
of other queer options

211
00:10:07.292 --> 00:10:08.292
for you to date at this school.

212
00:10:08.292 --> 00:10:09.875
Please.
- Like who?

213
00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:12.167
- Yeah. Paige. what about Chantal?

214
00:10:12.167 --> 00:10:15.292
I mean. she's like
a cool Wiccan lesbian.

215
00:10:15.292 --> 00:10:18.167
- Hell no. She's tried to put a love spell
on me at least six times.

216
00:10:18.167 --> 00:10:20.625
If I'm gonna date a witch.
she has to be a talented one.

217
00:10:20.625 --> 00:10:22.875
- Okay. True. True. True.

218
00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:27.042
How about. oh. how about Erin Billings?

219
00:10:27.042 --> 00:10:28.708
- No. she's a horse gay.

220
00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:30.542
- Alright? That's a little reductive.

221
00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:31.750
- Stacey's just mad

222
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.625
because she spent the summer
at an equestrian camp.

223
00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:36.083
- What about Aya?

224
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.083
No way. dude.

225
00:10:38.083 --> 00:10:40.667
I definitely don't have
enough followers to date them.

226
00:10:40.667 --> 00:10:43.417
Plus they're on and off with Gabby
every other week.

227
00:10:43.417 --> 00:10:44.625
- Yeah.
- True.

228
00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:45.667
- Hey. what about Amy?

229
00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:48.417
Amy? Yeah. right. Gateway gay.

230
00:10:48.417 --> 00:10:50.333
She's fingered
every girl in the school.

231
00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:51.542
So what?

232
00:10:51.542 --> 00:10:53.250
I'm sure she's washed her hands.
- Yeah.

233
00:10:53.708 --> 00:10:55.125
- Wait. no.
What about AJ?

234
00:10:55.125 --> 00:10:57.667
Why would I ever do that?
That's literally Gabby's sister.

235
00:10:57.667 --> 00:10:59.375
Also. is she even queer?

236
00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:00.875
Yeah. She's bi.

237
00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:02.208
And she's mysterious as hell.

238
00:11:02.208 --> 00:11:04.417
- Yeah. AJ actually came out
way before Gabs.

239
00:11:04.417 --> 00:11:06.000
but Gabs just dates more.

240
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.042
so everybody forgets
that AJ's queer too.

241
00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.250
Talk about bi erasure.

242
00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.042
Gabby!
- Hey. miss president.

243
00:11:12.042 --> 00:11:13.625
- Hey!
- Excuse you.

244
00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:14.625
- Anyway. question.

245
00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:16.333
Do you have the sign-up sheets
for track tryouts today?

246
00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:18.833
- I sure do.
Let me get that for you.

247
00:11:19.917 --> 00:11:20.958
- Hey.

248
00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:23.208
- Here you are.

249
00:11:23.208 --> 00:11:24.250
- Thank you.

250
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.042
- Oh. Gabby. you know Paige. right?

251
00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:27.542
- Um. yeah.

252
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.083
- Your locker is a site for sore eyes.

253
00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:33.917
- Um. thanks.

254
00:11:33.917 --> 00:11:35.333
Are you coming out today?

255
00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:38.042
- I've actually. I've been out
for a really long time.

256
00:11:38.042 --> 00:11:39.125
I'm extremely gay.

257
00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:42.625
- Oh. I was actually talking
about track tryouts. but--

258
00:11:44.208 --> 00:11:45.125
- Right.

259
00:11:45.125 --> 00:11:48.583
Yeah. I'm gonna see you there.
I'm gonna. I'm gonna go on track.

260
00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:52.125
- Yeah. right. The last time Paige ran.
she was fleeing from a bee.

261
00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:52.958
It was hilarious.

262
00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:53.750
It's on YouTube.

263
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.167
I watch it whenever I'm depressed.

264
00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:56.500
No. it's not.

265
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.333
- Well. I should run.
but maybe I'll see you later.

266
00:11:59.333 --> 00:12:00.250
- Bye. Gabby.

267
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.667
- Bye. Gabby.
- So long.

268
00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:03.042
- Vote for Dillon. babe!

269
00:12:03.042 --> 00:12:05.417
- No. She's not gonna vote for you. honey.

270
00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:07.167
- Stop staring
without consent please.

271
00:12:07.167 --> 00:12:08.625
It's horrifying.

272
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.292
Really? You? Track tryouts?

273
00:12:11.292 --> 00:12:14.417
- Yeah. Yeah. that's. that's it.

274
00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:15.625
That's how we're gonna fall in love.

275
00:12:15.625 --> 00:12:18.667
- I think you and Gabriela
would be disgustingly cute together.

276
00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:20.750
- And I think that
if it were going to happen.

277
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.042
it would've happened already.

278
00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:23.625
You can't force these things.

279
00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:25.333
Babe. I love you.
but you're so wrong.

280
00:12:26.583 --> 00:12:28.083
How many copies do you guys need?

281
00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:29.208
- One thousand.
- Two thousand.

282
00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:30.458
- Three thousand.
- Four thousand.

283
00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:31.500
- Five thousand.
- Six--

284
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.792
Gotcha!
- Ahh!

285
00:12:32.792 --> 00:12:35.792
Evans. I knew it was you.
Principal's office now.

286
00:12:35.792 --> 00:12:36.958
Go.

287
00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.208
- Oh. crap. I forgot my cleats.

288
00:12:38.208 --> 00:12:39.250
Uh. can you help me?

289
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.292
- Turn off the light.

290
00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:42.542
Shut the door.

291
00:12:43.667 --> 00:12:45.417
Yeah. Okay. actually leave it open.

292
00:12:46.917 --> 00:12:48.500
- I assume you know why you're here?

293
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.875
- Am I in trouble or something?

294
00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:53.083
- We are so done
with your games now. Evans.

295
00:12:53.083 --> 00:12:54.833
- Okay. Take it down.
Dexter Morgan.

296
00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:56.583
You're not a detective.
and this is not a cop show.

297
00:12:56.583 --> 00:12:57.542
Paige.

298
00:12:58.542 --> 00:13:00.292
we know that you are KingPun.

299
00:13:00.292 --> 00:13:02.500
Okay. And it's not that
the artwork isn't great.

300
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.542
it's really good.

301
00:13:03.542 --> 00:13:07.375
but all the pictures and then painting
all over the school last semester.

302
00:13:07.375 --> 00:13:10.500
And not to mention
a new mural every week.

303
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.125
- That's not true.

304
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.583
Oh. you know it's true.
- Sorry.

305
00:13:13.583 --> 00:13:15.000
- Come on.

306
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.917
- The school board is not happy.
- Mm-hmm.

307
00:13:16.917 --> 00:13:19.167
- And plus all the kids are
tagging you every week

308
00:13:19.167 --> 00:13:20.292
in some KingPun art.

309
00:13:20.292 --> 00:13:22.042
- Goddammit. Tim.

310
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.667
- You guys. I swear
on my life. it's not me.

311
00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:30.458
- Bet you wish you would've invested
in that lie detector now. right?

312
00:13:30.458 --> 00:13:32.208
- No. No. I actually don't.

313
00:13:32.208 --> 00:13:33.500
- Why?
And I'm really tired of you

314
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.750
bringing it up all the time.

315
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.667
'Cause we had to take care
of something called asbestos. alright?

316
00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:38.792
Listen.

317
00:13:38.792 --> 00:13:42.042
I'm sorry. kiddo. but I have
to lead by example.

318
00:13:42.042 --> 00:13:44.375
So I'm gonna have to suspend you.
- Call the police.

319
00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:46.583
- No. we are not calling
the police.

320
00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:49.542
What are you. Wyclef Jean?
Ready to call 911?

321
00:13:49.542 --> 00:13:51.208
Do you get that reference?
You don't.

322
00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:54.167
God. my references are like
older than Taylor swift at this point.

323
00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.750
Listen. you're suspended.

324
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.708
I called your mom.
and she's on her way to pick you up.

325
00:13:57.708 --> 00:14:00.167
- You can't suspend me
for something

326
00:14:00.167 --> 00:14:02.042
that I. I literally did not do.

327
00:14:02.042 --> 00:14:02.875
- Yeah. we can.

328
00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:04.125
- No. we cannot.

329
00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:07.917
But you're the only student
with the keys to the art room.

330
00:14:07.917 --> 00:14:11.583
- Well. I was gonna give these back today.

331
00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:13.208
- Oh. Well. you got blood
on your hands.

332
00:14:13.208 --> 00:14:14.250
- It's paint.

333
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.917
- O-obviously. I know that.
It's a metaphor.

334
00:14:16.917 --> 00:14:18.167
- Well. I'm not metaphoric.

335
00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:21.250
- It's acrylic paint.
and those things are spray paint.

336
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.208
- Let's jot down that
Ms. Evans seems to have

337
00:14:23.208 --> 00:14:25.583
an intimate understanding
of the weapon of her choice.

338
00:14:25.583 --> 00:14:28.000
- No one's jotting down anything.
- Just jot it down. Just--

339
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.167
- No. don't tell me what to--

340
00:14:29.167 --> 00:14:31.458
This is my--
- You guys. please hear me out.

341
00:14:31.458 --> 00:14:33.542
I'm applying to
a summer program at CalArts.

342
00:14:33.542 --> 00:14:35.958
and this is gonna ruin
my chances of getting in.

343
00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:36.875
- I'm sorry. Paige.

344
00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:38.917
But I looked at your records.
and you were absent

345
00:14:38.917 --> 00:14:40.167
eight times last semester.

346
00:14:40.583 --> 00:14:43.875
Not to mention you're not even part
of one extracurricular activity.

347
00:14:43.875 --> 00:14:45.917
You're not the model student
I can fight for.

348
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.583
- I play. I play. I play track.

349
00:14:50.583 --> 00:14:53.458
- Hmm... not on my team.
you don't.

350
00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:55.292
- Well. I just joined today.

351
00:14:56.042 --> 00:14:57.958
I'm extremely cooperative
with this type of stuff.

352
00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.417
So can't this count
as a plea deal or something.

353
00:15:00.417 --> 00:15:02.500
- Oh. impressive use
of legal jargon.

354
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.958
But you don't play track.
you run track.

355
00:15:05.458 --> 00:15:06.208
- Hear me out.

356
00:15:06.208 --> 00:15:08.250
How about I join track.

357
00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.833
Coach Murray keeps
his eye on me.

358
00:15:10.833 --> 00:15:15.208
and I figure out in the meantime
who KingPun actually is.

359
00:15:15.667 --> 00:15:17.875
- Paige. I really like you.
I do.

360
00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:19.333
Actually. that's a lie.
I don't even know you.

361
00:15:19.333 --> 00:15:22.292
I hate myself that I have to say that.
but the evidence is stacked against you.

362
00:15:22.292 --> 00:15:24.208
And I don't understand how playing track
is supposed to help

363
00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:25.333
your case right now.

364
00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:28.583
- Actually. I do need
another couple people on the track team.

365
00:15:28.583 --> 00:15:30.333
- You need people on the track team?
- I need some more people.

366
00:15:30.333 --> 00:15:32.125
- Are you saying you wanna take her?

367
00:15:32.125 --> 00:15:35.167
She just said. "Play track."
Like she's a DJ or something.

368
00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:36.250
She doesn't even know how to run track.

369
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.917
How are you supposed
to make that Usain Bolt?

370
00:15:37.917 --> 00:15:38.750
You can't.

371
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.292
- I could use
a couple more bodies on the team.

372
00:15:40.292 --> 00:15:41.583
- I am exhausted.

373
00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:43.708
Okay. Paige.
you are no longer suspended.

374
00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:45.458
You are just on probation. Okay?

375
00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:48.500
If you can come up with a name
who you think KingPun really is.

376
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.667
because apparently
it's not you.

377
00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:51.458
by the end of the semester.

378
00:15:51.458 --> 00:15:53.125
then I'll take it
to the board meeting.

379
00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:55.458
- Well. I will deliver.
Thank you.

380
00:15:55.458 --> 00:15:56.750
I can't wait.

381
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:57.750
- Great. get out!

382
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.625
I have a Renaissance club meeting
that I'm not about to miss.

383
00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:02.917
You too! Take your little
swimming board with you.

384
00:16:02.917 --> 00:16:03.708
God.

385
00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.625
- Oh. It's like no moment to myself.

386
00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:10.875
I wish there was more money
for federal funding

387
00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:13.417
'cause I'll tell you what.
this ain't it.

388
00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:16.333
- Thank you so much.

389
00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:18.625
- Don't thank me yet.
I'm watching you.

390
00:16:18.625 --> 00:16:19.958
- Oh. Hey. clipboard.

391
00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.792
I left a patient
with a full bed pan for this.

392
00:16:22.792 --> 00:16:24.375
You are not suspending
my daughter.

393
00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:25.875
She did nothing wrong.
- We're not suspending her.

394
00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:27.292
A-- Hmm?

395
00:16:27.292 --> 00:16:28.833
- I made a deal.

396
00:16:28.833 --> 00:16:31.750
- You have
a very savvy daughter. Mrs.--

397
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.917
- Mrs. Mm-hmm.

398
00:16:32.917 --> 00:16:34.625
That's very revealing.

399
00:16:35.208 --> 00:16:36.542
It's miss.

400
00:16:36.542 --> 00:16:41.083
But you can call me Angie
or Ang or "Hey. girl."

401
00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:44.875
You know. I am a single mother
by choice.

402
00:16:44.875 --> 00:16:46.208
Not by circumstance.

403
00:16:46.208 --> 00:16:50.333
I like to have sex with men.
I don't even have to have a relationship.

404
00:16:50.333 --> 00:16:51.875
Hmm. What do you think of that?

405
00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:55.417
- Well. hey. girl.
if you don't mind me saying.

406
00:16:55.417 --> 00:16:57.417
you have an incredible figure.

407
00:16:57.417 --> 00:16:58.500
- Oh my god.

408
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.500
- We are in a school. sir.

409
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.500
That is so wildly inappropriate.

410
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.500
- I'm sorry. Uh--

411
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.125
- And 100 percent spot on.

412
00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:09.167
This is gold.

413
00:17:09.167 --> 00:17:10.333
You should see me naked.

414
00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:12.917
- Well. I'd say I'm sorry that you had
to drive out here for nothing.

415
00:17:12.917 --> 00:17:16.042
but I'd be lying if I said
it wasn't nice to meet you.

416
00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:18.042
- I can't believe this guy.

417
00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:22.667
- And. uh... if you do come
to Paige's track meet.

418
00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.667
don't be afraid to say. hello.

419
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.333
- I'm not afraid of anything.

420
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.667
It's you who should be afraid.

421
00:17:31.667 --> 00:17:32.917
Wow.

422
00:17:33.542 --> 00:17:35.542
Track. That's fucked up.
- Yeah.

423
00:17:35.542 --> 00:17:38.000
The deal just didn't work out
that great for me.

424
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.125
but it did for you.

425
00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:40.750
So--
- Yeah. It really did.

426
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.167
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

427
00:17:42.167 --> 00:17:44.917
Is he in the school directory?

428
00:17:49.667 --> 00:17:53.667
Basically. if I don't find KingPun.
then my life is over.

429
00:17:53.667 --> 00:17:55.792
- On the plus side.
you totally fit in here.

430
00:17:56.792 --> 00:17:59.917
- I feel like I look like
a very specific type of gay right now.

431
00:18:00.833 --> 00:18:01.750
Do I at least look like a top?

432
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.125
- Total bottom.

433
00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:04.417
Maybe a power bottom?

434
00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:07.125
- Like you call her daddy
and she calls you her sweet little prince.

435
00:18:07.125 --> 00:18:08.125
- Mm-hmm.

436
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.583
- Okay! Listen up!

437
00:18:12.583 --> 00:18:14.333
Come on. come on in here!

438
00:18:14.333 --> 00:18:15.875
Let's go! Gather round!

439
00:18:15.875 --> 00:18:16.625
Listen up!

440
00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:19.083
Returning athletes!

441
00:18:19.083 --> 00:18:21.750
I'm gonna be looking to make sure
that you kept your training up

442
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.042
during the off season.

443
00:18:24.042 --> 00:18:25.500
Alright?

444
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.417
Now you newcomers.

445
00:18:27.417 --> 00:18:31.375
our co-captains.
AJ and Gabby here.

446
00:18:31.375 --> 00:18:34.250
will be helping place you
in an event.

447
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.542
- Woo.
- Okay. Got this.

448
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.500
- For Evans over there.

449
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.333
just try to find the thing
that she sucks at the least.

450
00:18:41.333 --> 00:18:42.042
Alright?

451
00:18:42.042 --> 00:18:44.125
- Don't you wanna
at least see me try out

452
00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:45.625
before you think that I suck?

453
00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.000
- No. Okay!

454
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.792
Back to it! Let's go!

455
00:18:48.792 --> 00:18:49.917
Let's go!
Can you get my water?

456
00:18:49.917 --> 00:18:51.417
- She's coming.
She's coming. She's coming.

457
00:18:51.417 --> 00:18:52.875
- Hi. you made it.

458
00:18:52.875 --> 00:18:55.167
I'll be sure to let you know
if I see any angry bees around.

459
00:18:56.167 --> 00:18:58.042
- Did you know that
male bees lose their penises

460
00:18:58.042 --> 00:18:59.375
when they have sex
with the queen bee?

461
00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:03.792
- Uh. no. we didn't.

462
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.292
but now we sure do. right?

463
00:19:06.292 --> 00:19:08.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah. we should get started.

464
00:19:09.417 --> 00:19:10.917
Don't worry. You're gonna be great.

465
00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:01.667
- Holy shit!

466
00:20:03.417 --> 00:20:04.625
- Are you fucking kidding me?

467
00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:14.708
- Thanks.
- Yep.

468
00:20:26.917 --> 00:20:27.417
- No.

469
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.292
I have an idea.

470
00:20:30.292 --> 00:20:32.125
How do you feel about running
in a straight line?

471
00:20:32.708 --> 00:20:35.125
- That's the only straight thing I can do.

472
00:20:36.917 --> 00:20:37.667
Okay.

473
00:20:38.375 --> 00:20:40.625
- I regretted it the second
that it left my mouth.

474
00:20:42.667 --> 00:20:44.083
- You mean adding her to the four by one?

475
00:20:44.417 --> 00:20:45.458
- Do you have a better idea?

476
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.917
Alright. Here we go.

477
00:20:49.167 --> 00:20:51.458
On your mark.
Get set.

478
00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:53.333
No. No. down.

479
00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:54.792
KingPun. let's get it.

480
00:20:54.792 --> 00:20:56.625
- Go! Come on!
Come on. Paige!

481
00:20:56.625 --> 00:20:57.875
Come on!

482
00:21:26.333 --> 00:21:28.208
- I am the fastest woman alive.

483
00:21:28.208 --> 00:21:30.792
- That was mediocre at best.

484
00:21:30.792 --> 00:21:32.583
- Yeah. I took an Instagram story.
and it went over the time limit.

485
00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:34.250
- Damn.
- But you did it.

486
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.292
- With a little work.
maybe you could be fine.

487
00:21:36.292 --> 00:21:38.250
- She's four seconds behind
where she needs to be.

488
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:42.167
- Well. maybe I need someone great
to teach me after school.

489
00:21:42.875 --> 00:21:44.667
- Alright. That's not a terrible idea.

490
00:21:45.208 --> 00:21:46.000
Uh. AJ.

491
00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:47.875
You're gonna train Paige.

492
00:21:48.375 --> 00:21:49.167
Okay?

493
00:21:49.667 --> 00:21:51.333
- Isn't that literally your job as coach?

494
00:21:51.333 --> 00:21:54.625
- No. my job as coach is
to motivate through fear.

495
00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:57.583
Besides. I don't get paid enough
to stay after school.

496
00:21:57.917 --> 00:21:59.583
Come on.
I'm watching you. Evans.

497
00:21:59.583 --> 00:22:00.542
- Welcome to the team.

498
00:22:00.542 --> 00:22:01.917
- Alright. KingPun.

499
00:22:01.917 --> 00:22:03.000
I'm not KingPun.

500
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.417
- Your shorts are on backwards.

501
00:22:04.833 --> 00:22:05.583
What?

502
00:22:10.583 --> 00:22:12.792
Can you hurry up. Angie?
I'm starving.

503
00:22:12.792 --> 00:22:14.042
You're not the boss of me.

504
00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:16.292
You knew we were gonna be home.
Why wasn't the food ready?

505
00:22:16.958 --> 00:22:19.667
- Today was great.
I almost killed somebody with a javelin.

506
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:20.958
- It's true.

507
00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:22.917
- And then it was nearly death
by hurdle.

508
00:22:22.917 --> 00:22:24.208
- Also very true.

509
00:22:24.208 --> 00:22:26.667
- And I embarrassed myself
in front of Gabriela.

510
00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:29.250
- Just because
Paige's sex life is in a drought

511
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.750
doesn't mean the rest
of the world has to be.

512
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.333
Come on. Angie.
we've talked about this.

513
00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:33.583
- So strict.

514
00:22:33.583 --> 00:22:35.542
- Sometimes I think fondly back
on to this morning

515
00:22:35.542 --> 00:22:37.167
when my life was completely normal.

516
00:22:37.167 --> 00:22:39.250
Now I have
to solve a mystery.

517
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.250
make Gabby fall
in love with me.

518
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.542
figure out how to make
the perfect thing for CalArts.

519
00:22:43.542 --> 00:22:46.000
and figure out
how to put a tampon in

520
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.875
without the end
always sticking out a little bit.

521
00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:49.792
- Yeah. you know.
I never mastered that either.

522
00:22:50.458 --> 00:22:52.167
Oh. but you know what?
On the bright side.

523
00:22:52.167 --> 00:22:55.750
true artists are never afraid
to step out of their comfort zones. so--

524
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.708
- Speaking of stepping
out of your comfort zones.

525
00:22:58.708 --> 00:23:00.708
are you going
to Stacey's party on Friday?

526
00:23:00.708 --> 00:23:01.625
- What party?

527
00:23:01.625 --> 00:23:02.875
- Are you kidding me?

528
00:23:02.875 --> 00:23:05.167
Paige. I've told you this
a billion times.

529
00:23:05.167 --> 00:23:06.292
It'd be. like.
a good opportunity for you

530
00:23:06.292 --> 00:23:07.792
to act like a normal teenager for once.

531
00:23:07.792 --> 00:23:10.292
- She doesn't wanna be normal.
Nobody wants to be normal.

532
00:23:10.292 --> 00:23:11.625
- That's why I'm cool.

533
00:23:11.625 --> 00:23:13.292
- Alright. Let me tell you
a little story.

534
00:23:14.292 --> 00:23:15.875
When I was a teenager.

535
00:23:15.875 --> 00:23:18.667
I went to this rager. and I ended up
in the back of a van

536
00:23:18.667 --> 00:23:21.000
with the lead singer
of an Aerosmith cover band.

537
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
And in retrospect.

538
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.792
I definitely should have
held out for the real thing.

539
00:23:25.792 --> 00:23:27.125
I mean. think about it.

540
00:23:27.125 --> 00:23:29.833
Steven Tyler. I would've never had
to buy another scarf.

541
00:23:30.667 --> 00:23:32.250
- Dillon. I totally wasn't thinking.

542
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.000
This party is the perfect place
to investigate.

543
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
KingPun will
definitely be going

544
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.792
and. well. let's just say that
they will rue the day

545
00:23:39.792 --> 00:23:41.583
that they let me take
the fall for them.

546
00:23:41.583 --> 00:23:42.667
I know that's right.

547
00:23:44.833 --> 00:23:45.667
- Okay.

548
00:23:46.167 --> 00:23:47.625
I'm gonna need you to relax.

549
00:23:47.625 --> 00:23:48.750
You're starting to scare me.

550
00:23:49.417 --> 00:23:51.250
Oh my god. I totally forgot.

551
00:23:51.917 --> 00:23:52.917
Pardon me.

552
00:23:53.875 --> 00:23:56.583
Paige. I took the liberty
of washing your sex toy.

553
00:23:57.125 --> 00:23:59.375
By the way.
this is very small.

554
00:23:59.375 --> 00:24:01.083
I could totally get lost
up there.

555
00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:03.583
So you might wanna think about.
you know. my moving on up.

556
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.667
I can help.

557
00:24:04.667 --> 00:24:07.750
- Well. that's an eraser.
so that's not gonna go up there.

558
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.042
- Anything's possible.

559
00:24:10.167 --> 00:24:12.042
Think about me
and my electric toothbrush.

560
00:24:12.042 --> 00:24:15.083
And it's not the end
you would think either.

561
00:24:15.083 --> 00:24:17.667
- Okay. Well. we don't have
everything in common.

562
00:24:17.958 --> 00:24:20.292
And I'm gonna go in my room.
Yeah.

563
00:24:20.708 --> 00:24:23.000
I'm gonna throw up.
That's really disgusting.

564
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.250
- No. you're disgusting.

565
00:24:24.583 --> 00:24:27.292
This is a sex positive house. Paige.

566
00:24:27.792 --> 00:24:29.583
Shame does not live here.

567
00:24:33.667 --> 00:24:34.792
- Hey.

568
00:24:35.125 --> 00:24:36.000
Thanks for having us.

569
00:24:37.833 --> 00:24:39.250
- Thought I smelled ambition.

570
00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:40.833
- You look so beautiful.

571
00:24:41.958 --> 00:24:45.250
- Paige. I cannot believe we finally
got you to a high school party.

572
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:46.625
- Now let's see if you survive it.

573
00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:55.708
Bombs away.

574
00:24:57.292 --> 00:24:59.208
Chug! Chug! Chug!

575
00:24:59.208 --> 00:25:01.292
Welcome to the high school experience.

576
00:25:01.292 --> 00:25:03.375
- It smells better than I expected.

577
00:25:03.375 --> 00:25:04.375
- I lit candles.

578
00:25:04.667 --> 00:25:07.833
- First order of business.
time to get you drunk.

579
00:25:07.833 --> 00:25:09.500
Like. if you don't throw up
by the end of the night.

580
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.792
then I didn't do my job.

581
00:25:11.167 --> 00:25:14.042
- I still can't believe this is the first
of my parties you've been to. Paige.

582
00:25:14.042 --> 00:25:16.917
- That's because Paige Evans is
too cool for high school parties.

583
00:25:16.917 --> 00:25:18.333
- Cool is one word for it.

584
00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:20.833
I just have a general distaste
for sticky floors.

585
00:25:20.833 --> 00:25:23.708
communal chip bowls.
and whatever that is.

586
00:25:24.125 --> 00:25:26.750
- That. my friend. is the type
of sociological research

587
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.292
you can't find in any textbook.

588
00:25:28.292 --> 00:25:29.125
- He's right.

589
00:25:29.125 --> 00:25:31.292
My future constituents
may act slightly moronic.

590
00:25:31.292 --> 00:25:32.917
but they know how to have fun.

591
00:25:34.042 --> 00:25:36.583
- Your future constituents. huh?
- Oh please.

592
00:25:36.583 --> 00:25:38.042
You know I'm gonna kick your ass.

593
00:25:38.042 --> 00:25:40.250
There's no way they won't vote
for my anti-authority platform.

594
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.208
It's like taking candy
from a politically informed baby.

595
00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:45.833
- You wanna go upstairs and practice
your campaign speech on me?

596
00:25:45.833 --> 00:25:48.292
- Work on our inflection?
- Show me those pointed hand movements.

597
00:25:48.292 --> 00:25:52.042
- Why do you guys even bother
with innuendo.

598
00:25:53.625 --> 00:25:54.542
- Later. Paige.

599
00:25:54.542 --> 00:25:56.833
- Oh yeah. guys. just leave me alone

600
00:25:56.833 --> 00:25:59.167
while I try and figure out who framed me?

601
00:25:59.583 --> 00:26:00.375
- Oh.
- Paige.

602
00:26:00.375 --> 00:26:01.792
- Oh my god.
- Hi.

603
00:26:01.792 --> 00:26:02.667
- I didn't see you there.

604
00:26:02.667 --> 00:26:04.333
- Must be the masking spell.
- What?

605
00:26:04.333 --> 00:26:06.375
- How have you been?
Feeling any different lately?

606
00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:08.708
Any lustful urges?
Deep magnetic pulls?

607
00:26:08.708 --> 00:26:10.583
- Mm-mm.
- To anything? Anyone?

608
00:26:10.583 --> 00:26:11.583
- Excuse me.
- AJ.

609
00:26:11.583 --> 00:26:12.583
There you are.

610
00:26:12.583 --> 00:26:13.792
- Hi.

611
00:26:13.792 --> 00:26:15.833
- We should go talk about track.

612
00:26:15.833 --> 00:26:18.458
- I don't think so.
Did the virgin blood expire?

613
00:26:18.458 --> 00:26:19.500
That can't be. that was fresh.

614
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.125
- Okay. yeah.
we can talk about track.

615
00:26:21.125 --> 00:26:22.458
- It's supposed
to get stronger with age.

616
00:26:22.458 --> 00:26:23.625
Like. it's like fine wine.

617
00:26:23.625 --> 00:26:24.708
- Hi.
- Hi.

618
00:26:30.458 --> 00:26:32.542
- Okay. I wasn't gonna get
all Salem witch trials

619
00:26:32.542 --> 00:26:34.833
and point fingers here.
but I know that she put a curse on me.

620
00:26:35.417 --> 00:26:38.083
- I mean. she did steal some
of my hair back in freshman year.

621
00:26:38.083 --> 00:26:39.458
so I believe it.

622
00:26:45.167 --> 00:26:47.458
So track. why?

623
00:26:47.458 --> 00:26:49.167
I thought you were
more interested in art.

624
00:26:49.167 --> 00:26:50.583
- Oh. trust me. I am.

625
00:26:50.583 --> 00:26:52.208
But lucky for me.

626
00:26:52.208 --> 00:26:54.750
Principal Collins decided
that I'm KingPun.

627
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.708
So I have to figure out who KingPun is.

628
00:26:56.708 --> 00:26:58.792
Otherwise. I'm going
to get suspended.

629
00:26:59.083 --> 00:27:00.417
- That's so dumb.

630
00:27:01.083 --> 00:27:01.750
- Yeah.

631
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:02.833
- That art is harmless.

632
00:27:02.833 --> 00:27:05.167
- I know.
It's also pretty good.

633
00:27:05.167 --> 00:27:06.250
- Do you have any leads?

634
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.083
- I know that they're here.
That's about it.

635
00:27:09.458 --> 00:27:12.292
I'm just gonna poke around
until somebody cracks.

636
00:27:13.792 --> 00:27:16.500
- So you're gonna interrogate
a bunch of drunk teens.

637
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.625
Seems pretty easy.

638
00:27:20.167 --> 00:27:22.292
- Well. you say that.
but it could be anybody.

639
00:27:22.625 --> 00:27:23.583
It could be you.

640
00:27:24.083 --> 00:27:26.375
- Do I look whimsical enough
for puns?

641
00:27:27.333 --> 00:27:30.542
- Okay. Well. you do have
an intimidating.

642
00:27:31.375 --> 00:27:32.792
no bullshit.

643
00:27:32.792 --> 00:27:34.750
striped shirt vibe going.

644
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.042
So I guess not.

645
00:27:36.458 --> 00:27:37.208
- Thank you.

646
00:27:38.125 --> 00:27:42.083
- Which would make you
the perfect bad cop

647
00:27:42.083 --> 00:27:43.708
to my good cop.

648
00:27:43.708 --> 00:27:44.875
- Excuse me?

649
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.292
- Follow me.
- Oh.

650
00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:53.625
- Hi. Erin.
- Hi.

651
00:27:53.625 --> 00:27:56.500
- Where were you at00 a. m.
on the morning of the 14th.

652
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.792
- We get Tybalt groomed
on Sundays.

653
00:27:58.792 --> 00:28:01.208
Tybalt. My horse.
Do you wanna see a photo?

654
00:28:03.417 --> 00:28:04.583
Oh. my phone is dead.

655
00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:06.333
- Yeah. No. never. never mind.
Thank you.

656
00:28:09.042 --> 00:28:11.417
How close is the nearest
Michael's art supply from your house?

657
00:28:11.417 --> 00:28:12.875
Who's Michael?

658
00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:14.625
- Can I have a hit?
- Me too?

659
00:28:15.667 --> 00:28:17.542
- You have a secret Instagram. right?

660
00:28:17.542 --> 00:28:18.917
- Yeah. but you can't afford
to follow it.

661
00:28:18.917 --> 00:28:20.458
- Sorry.

662
00:28:20.458 --> 00:28:22.000
- Can you guys shine
your lights on me?

663
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.917
Alright. man. you ready?

664
00:28:22.917 --> 00:28:23.792
Thank you.

665
00:28:28.833 --> 00:28:30.125
Tim.

666
00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:31.333
What do you think of KingPun?

667
00:28:31.333 --> 00:28:32.125
- Oh. Paige here?

668
00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:33.875
- Aren't your parents both artists. Tim?

669
00:28:33.875 --> 00:28:35.250
- Isn't your mom a nurse.

670
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.250
- Your point?

671
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:37.792
- I haven't seen you save anyone's life.

672
00:28:37.792 --> 00:28:38.875
- He's got a good point.

673
00:28:38.875 --> 00:28:40.208
- You're supposed to be on my side.

674
00:28:40.208 --> 00:28:41.083
- Right.

675
00:28:41.583 --> 00:28:44.500
- Chantal. would you
consider yourself an artist?

676
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.125
- I mean. every witch is
an artist in their own way.

677
00:28:48.125 --> 00:28:50.625
But. I mean. yeah.
I post to Tumblr all the time.

678
00:28:50.625 --> 00:28:52.167
That's mostly just like
Buffy. Faith.

679
00:28:52.167 --> 00:28:53.833
the brothers from Supernatural
sixty-nining.

680
00:28:53.833 --> 00:28:55.042
So. normal.

681
00:28:55.583 --> 00:28:57.458
- Well. what art tools do you use?

682
00:28:57.458 --> 00:28:58.917
- I mean. I kind of dabble
in everything.

683
00:28:58.917 --> 00:29:01.417
Illustrator. oil paints.
menstrual blood.

684
00:29:02.125 --> 00:29:03.583
- Oh. Oh no.

685
00:29:03.583 --> 00:29:04.875
- Yeah. Okay. Bye.

686
00:29:06.292 --> 00:29:07.292
...get political.

687
00:29:07.292 --> 00:29:09.042
Mm-hmm.
You wanna get political?

688
00:29:09.042 --> 00:29:10.583
Oh yeah? You wanna--

689
00:29:10.583 --> 00:29:11.875
- Oh my fucking god.

690
00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:12.958
- Oh fuck.

691
00:29:12.958 --> 00:29:13.875
Oh. hi. Paige.
- Hey.

692
00:29:13.875 --> 00:29:16.625
- ...much bad things as possible...

693
00:29:16.625 --> 00:29:18.833
- Cover AOC's eyes.
she doesn't deserve to see this.

694
00:29:18.833 --> 00:29:20.625
- Okay.
- Come on!

695
00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:21.625
- That was easy.
- Bye.

696
00:29:23.208 --> 00:29:25.333
- So. her house is huge.

697
00:29:26.042 --> 00:29:27.458
- It just keeps going. I know.

698
00:29:27.458 --> 00:29:28.958
- They probably fuck in every room.

699
00:29:29.417 --> 00:29:32.000
Those two are--
- Are disturbingly cute

700
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.833
in a kind of kinky way?

701
00:29:33.833 --> 00:29:35.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

702
00:29:37.042 --> 00:29:39.042
Can't believe Chantal is
our best lead right now.

703
00:29:39.042 --> 00:29:40.583
- I mean. it kind of makes sense.

704
00:29:40.583 --> 00:29:42.542
I-I've seen her drawing
in class a few times.

705
00:29:42.542 --> 00:29:43.875
- What? Really?
- Mm.

706
00:29:43.875 --> 00:29:45.208
- Paige. AJ.

707
00:29:54.417 --> 00:29:56.333
- Oh my god. we need
to take shots. like. right now.

708
00:29:56.333 --> 00:29:57.833
For Paige joining
the track team.

709
00:29:58.375 --> 00:30:00.000
- Yeah. go ahead.
I'm gonna pee.

710
00:30:00.667 --> 00:30:02.167
- Okay. Let's go.

711
00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:03.042
- Okay.

712
00:30:13.625 --> 00:30:15.417
- Oh. Oh. Okay.

713
00:30:16.625 --> 00:30:18.250
To joining track!

714
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.375
- To... sports!

715
00:30:22.083 --> 00:30:23.625
- Bet our mouth stinks
the same right now.

716
00:30:23.625 --> 00:30:24.375
- What?

717
00:30:24.375 --> 00:30:25.833
- I just got something stuck
in my throat.

718
00:30:25.833 --> 00:30:27.417
- Another shot will fix that.
- Yeah.

719
00:30:27.417 --> 00:30:29.000
it always does.

720
00:30:43.833 --> 00:30:45.000
Yeah.

721
00:31:22.458 --> 00:31:24.000
- I'm so wasted.

722
00:31:24.417 --> 00:31:26.708
- Oh my god. I'm so glad
that you joined track.

723
00:31:26.708 --> 00:31:28.875
I feel like I never see you
outside of class.

724
00:31:28.875 --> 00:31:29.833
- I know.

725
00:31:30.833 --> 00:31:32.333
You're a Gemini. right?

726
00:31:32.708 --> 00:31:33.792
- I'm a Pisces.

727
00:31:33.792 --> 00:31:35.917
- Who says that complicated can't work.

728
00:31:35.917 --> 00:31:38.250
- What?
- I said I love track.

729
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.167
Gabby. come dance with us.

730
00:31:40.167 --> 00:31:41.250
Bye!

731
00:31:50.292 --> 00:31:53.667
- Are we at the sad drunk phase
in the night. huh?

732
00:31:54.167 --> 00:31:57.625
- Dillon. Dillon. Dill Pickle.

733
00:31:58.083 --> 00:32:00.083
- You wanna go home?
You'll be better. Yes.

734
00:32:00.083 --> 00:32:01.917
Your drunk ass has a training
with AJ tomorrow.

735
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.375
- Oh shit.
- Right. Yeah.

736
00:32:04.375 --> 00:32:06.750
Mr. President--

737
00:32:08.208 --> 00:32:10.417
- Wow. Thank you so much
for calling me Mr. President.

738
00:32:10.417 --> 00:32:12.083
- You're welcome.
- Okay. let's go.

739
00:32:14.083 --> 00:32:15.375
- Bye. bad cop.

740
00:32:16.083 --> 00:32:18.083
- Bye. I'll see you tomorrow.
Drink some Gatorade.

741
00:32:18.833 --> 00:32:20.417
Sports juice.

742
00:32:22.458 --> 00:32:24.083
- I like boobs.
you know what I'm saying?

743
00:32:24.708 --> 00:32:26.458
Tim. I see what you're doing.

744
00:32:26.458 --> 00:32:27.542
Evidence.

745
00:32:28.667 --> 00:32:30.167
Evidence.

746
00:32:32.333 --> 00:32:33.667
- Who doesn't like boobs?

747
00:32:33.667 --> 00:32:34.583
- Cheers.

748
00:32:38.042 --> 00:32:40.375
Woo! Who's ready to party?

749
00:32:42.292 --> 00:32:43.667
- You're so strong.

750
00:32:43.667 --> 00:32:44.833
- I am strong.

751
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.750
- Oh. Whoa.
- Whoa.

752
00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.500
- Come on. our ride is here.

753
00:32:57.333 --> 00:32:58.208
You made it?

754
00:32:58.208 --> 00:32:59.417
- Yep.

755
00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:02.875
Okay. Let's make me
an Olympian.

756
00:33:04.542 --> 00:33:06.208
- How are you not
massively hungover right now?

757
00:33:06.208 --> 00:33:09.208
- Well. I drank that Gatorade
that you suggested.

758
00:33:09.208 --> 00:33:12.375
and then I had a hot pocket
and then I had some pizza

759
00:33:12.375 --> 00:33:13.708
and then I had
some ice cream.

760
00:33:13.708 --> 00:33:15.500
Also. I might still be drunk.

761
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.542
- Is that coffee?
Did you bring any water?

762
00:33:21.917 --> 00:33:26.083
- Hmm. Okay. If this mentor-protÃ©gÃ© thing
is going to work out.

763
00:33:26.083 --> 00:33:28.875
then you have to respect
my caffeinated process.

764
00:33:28.875 --> 00:33:30.500
- Who said anything
about being a mentor?

765
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.458
I'm only doing this
so you don't tank our ranking.

766
00:33:32.458 --> 00:33:34.000
- Oh. I'm sorry.

767
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.833
Am I cutting into your

768
00:33:35.833 --> 00:33:38.500
brooding-in-corners
wearing-a-leather-jacket time?

769
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.042
- I don't own a leather jacket

770
00:33:40.042 --> 00:33:42.125
- Well. you look like you could.
- Okay.

771
00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:45.542
- So what are we doing first?
Picking out my pump-up song?

772
00:33:45.542 --> 00:33:48.292
- No. but you can stretch.
and then we can start on three miles.

773
00:33:48.292 --> 00:33:49.542
- Three miles?

774
00:33:50.458 --> 00:33:54.125
That is 2.9 more miles
than they said I have to run.

775
00:33:54.125 --> 00:33:55.500
- 2.94 miles.

776
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.375
You're confusing miles
and meters.

777
00:33:57.375 --> 00:33:59.708
- I think you're confusing me
with the metric system.

778
00:34:01.042 --> 00:34:01.875
- Let's go. Evans.

779
00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:05.542
Put down your stuff.

780
00:34:22.708 --> 00:34:23.667
- Oh my god.

781
00:34:27.167 --> 00:34:28.167
Oh my god.

782
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.167
I can't feel anything.

783
00:34:30.958 --> 00:34:32.000
I can't feel my legs.

784
00:34:32.583 --> 00:34:34.250
I can't feel my face.

785
00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:36.792
- You're being a little dramatic.

786
00:34:36.792 --> 00:34:38.792
- It's the artist in me.

787
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.250
- Speaking of.

788
00:34:42.833 --> 00:34:44.125
you wanna go to art school?

789
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.458
- Yeah.

790
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.375
Now that's like my biggest dream.

791
00:34:49.958 --> 00:34:50.708
- Hmm.

792
00:34:50.708 --> 00:34:53.500
- But now that the pressure's on
and I have to send in my summer app.

793
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.125
I have no idea
what to send in.

794
00:34:55.625 --> 00:34:56.542
- You started it yet?

795
00:35:00.083 --> 00:35:01.792
- Since you asked.

796
00:35:04.917 --> 00:35:06.792
I've been working
on a few different things.

797
00:35:08.417 --> 00:35:10.375
But none of it feels right to me.

798
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.583
- Shit. you're really good.

799
00:35:15.125 --> 00:35:16.667
- Thank you.

800
00:35:17.667 --> 00:35:19.792
Now I just have
to make CalArt see that.

801
00:35:20.833 --> 00:35:22.917
Pretend you're CalArts.
Tell me what's missing.

802
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.042
- Uh... nothing.

803
00:35:26.667 --> 00:35:27.667
I. I think it's really great.

804
00:35:30.042 --> 00:35:31.375
- You're a really bad liar.

805
00:35:31.375 --> 00:35:33.292
- No. I just--
- Come on.

806
00:35:34.042 --> 00:35:35.083
Tell me the truth.

807
00:35:36.042 --> 00:35:38.958
- I don't know. I'm. I mean.
I'm not an expert by any means.

808
00:35:38.958 --> 00:35:40.708
but maybe it's just.

809
00:35:41.667 --> 00:35:45.500
it is lacking some emotion.

810
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.917
- Okay.

811
00:35:46.917 --> 00:35:50.250
I wasn't expecting
constructive criticism. but alright.

812
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.750
- I knew that was a draft.
Look. your art is amazing.

813
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:53.708
Seriously.

814
00:35:53.708 --> 00:35:54.625
What was the prompt again?

815
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.375
- Show us your happiest moment.

816
00:35:57.375 --> 00:35:59.792
- Right. okay. So do you think
that that. that shows that?

817
00:35:59.792 --> 00:36:03.958
Or is there anything
that is maybe happier?

818
00:36:04.708 --> 00:36:08.333
- I had a really yummy donut
the other day.

819
00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:10.792
- Uh. what about a.

820
00:36:11.708 --> 00:36:15.500
a first love
or a first kiss or something?

821
00:36:16.125 --> 00:36:18.208
- Uh. well. I haven't had
those things.

822
00:36:18.208 --> 00:36:20.625
so you're really pouring salt
on the wound here. AJ.

823
00:36:21.042 --> 00:36:23.792
- All I'm saying is that
you'll get there.

824
00:36:24.625 --> 00:36:26.833
Just don't be afraid
to draw something

825
00:36:26.833 --> 00:36:28.250
a little more vulnerable.

826
00:36:32.375 --> 00:36:35.083
- Look. they just posted something.

827
00:36:35.875 --> 00:36:37.375
Guess that would rule you out.

828
00:36:37.375 --> 00:36:39.083
- At least it's not
on school property this time.

829
00:36:39.083 --> 00:36:41.750
- Well. it's a little late
for that KingPun.

830
00:36:43.208 --> 00:36:44.708
- Let's go. Frida Kahlo.

831
00:36:44.708 --> 00:36:46.000
We've gotta get you to a point
where you can run

832
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.917
without wanting to puke.

833
00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.542
- Might give me an edge.

834
00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:50.958
- Doubt it.

835
00:36:52.125 --> 00:36:54.500
- Did you know that
Frida Kahlo was bi?

836
00:36:55.792 --> 00:36:58.500
She was the OG bi-con.

837
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.000
- Oh. nice. Uh--

838
00:37:01.375 --> 00:37:03.625
- Got joke for days. AJ.

839
00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:17.958
- Come on--

840
00:37:18.833 --> 00:37:20.500
Come on.
Come on. you got it.

841
00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.000
Go. Go. Push.

842
00:37:22.958 --> 00:37:25.083
Come on. KingPun. get it. Get that tire.

843
00:37:25.667 --> 00:37:26.667
Yeah!

844
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:54.583
- Hey. Look.

845
00:38:09.708 --> 00:38:10.500
- Hey!

846
00:38:11.375 --> 00:38:12.125
- Hi.

847
00:38:25.208 --> 00:38:27.292
Come on.
Come on. Stacey. Oh no!

848
00:38:28.167 --> 00:38:29.667
Come on. Gabby. you got it.
- I'm sorry.

849
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.042
Come on. AJ.
you got this.

850
00:38:40.167 --> 00:38:42.208
AJ! You got this!

851
00:38:42.208 --> 00:38:44.167
You got it! You got it!

852
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.417
Yeah! Yeah!
- Come on!

853
00:38:46.417 --> 00:38:48.542
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

854
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:53.333
- Yes!

855
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.625
- Oh my god!

856
00:39:01.708 --> 00:39:03.125
Oh. Coach. Coach. Coach.

857
00:39:03.125 --> 00:39:05.125
- Okay. Alright!

858
00:39:05.125 --> 00:39:06.500
Alright.

859
00:39:07.542 --> 00:39:09.667
- It goes against my entire
coaching approach to say this.

860
00:39:09.667 --> 00:39:12.167
but you're actually getting
pretty good.

861
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.833
- I knew you were using
a tough love approach with me.

862
00:39:15.833 --> 00:39:18.292
- I know. who do I think I am.
my dad?

863
00:39:20.667 --> 00:39:22.333
That. that was a lot funnier
in my head.

864
00:39:23.583 --> 00:39:24.583
- It's okay. dude.

865
00:39:24.958 --> 00:39:27.333
I'm no stranger
to dark dad humor.

866
00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:29.833
Is he tough on you?

867
00:39:31.333 --> 00:39:32.625
- He just sees
so much potential in me.

868
00:39:32.625 --> 00:39:34.000
I guess I don't wanna
let him down.

869
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.958
He wants me to get
a scholarship to a D1 school.

870
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:39.667
I think that's why I'm so stressed
about doing well.

871
00:39:41.708 --> 00:39:42.792
But I don't wanna talk
about my dad.

872
00:39:43.208 --> 00:39:45.417
I'll save that one
for a future therapy session.

873
00:39:45.917 --> 00:39:47.500
- Speaking of psychoanalyzing.

874
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.125
I think that you were right
about my art.

875
00:39:49.625 --> 00:39:51.625
I. I think I do play it safe.

876
00:39:52.292 --> 00:39:53.208
- I get it.

877
00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:56.333
- But I'm not gonna let you forget
that you said I was good.

878
00:39:56.333 --> 00:39:59.708
A compliment from
the mysterious AJ Campos.

879
00:39:59.708 --> 00:40:01.500
- Don't make me
regret it. Evans.

880
00:40:04.667 --> 00:40:05.542
You wanna try?

881
00:40:05.542 --> 00:40:08.917
- Mm. Can you play track
with a broken leg?

882
00:40:08.917 --> 00:40:09.917
- Don't worry. I'll spot you.

883
00:40:14.417 --> 00:40:15.750
- Oh shit.

884
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:16.708
- Okay. Bend your knees.

885
00:40:35.917 --> 00:40:36.833
- Hold up.

886
00:40:38.292 --> 00:40:39.000
- What?

887
00:40:40.708 --> 00:40:42.375
- I think that
this is KingPun's notebook.

888
00:40:42.375 --> 00:40:44.000
- What. h-how do you know?

889
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.667
- Look. dude.

890
00:40:45.667 --> 00:40:48.458
it's totally in their style.
and it has KP written all over it.

891
00:40:48.458 --> 00:40:49.833
- Oh yeah. that would do it.

892
00:40:49.833 --> 00:40:51.208
- Maybe it's somebody in track.

893
00:40:51.875 --> 00:40:53.542
- Well. that would rule out Chantal.

894
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.875
- It was never her.

895
00:40:54.875 --> 00:40:57.958
Cute puns are not her vibe.
now that I think of it.

896
00:40:59.042 --> 00:41:01.417
This is exactly how
I'm gonna nail KingPun.

897
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.875
- How?

898
00:41:03.417 --> 00:41:06.458
- I'm gonna DM them and tell them
that I have their notebook.

899
00:41:06.458 --> 00:41:08.167
There's tons
of half-baked ideas in here.

900
00:41:08.167 --> 00:41:10.417
It's not like they're gonna
wanna leave it behind.

901
00:41:11.625 --> 00:41:12.500
So what?

902
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.042
You're just gonna
give it back to them

903
00:41:14.042 --> 00:41:15.542
without figuring out who it is?

904
00:41:15.542 --> 00:41:17.083
- AJ. You kidding me?

905
00:41:19.417 --> 00:41:21.958
We're gonna have
a motherfucking stakeout.

906
00:41:23.167 --> 00:41:24.375
- Oh. No.

907
00:41:28.792 --> 00:41:30.000
Hold on.

908
00:41:30.375 --> 00:41:33.458
- It's almost- 00 p. m..
and KingPun left me on read.

909
00:41:33.458 --> 00:41:34.917
So I know that they saw it.

910
00:41:35.417 --> 00:41:37.708
- Wow. Your detection skills are on point.

911
00:41:38.708 --> 00:41:40.500
- We should split up.
Cover more ground.

912
00:41:40.917 --> 00:41:43.083
- Oh god.
your efficiency is hot.

913
00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:43.708
- You're hot.

914
00:41:43.708 --> 00:41:44.750
- Help. Help. Help. Help.

915
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:46.042
- You know
the gate's open. right?

916
00:41:47.042 --> 00:41:47.958
Oh!
- Oh my god!

917
00:41:47.958 --> 00:41:49.542
Paige. Are you okay?

918
00:41:49.542 --> 00:41:51.042
- Ay. dios mio.
- Do you need help? Are you good?

919
00:41:51.042 --> 00:41:52.042
- Ow.

920
00:41:52.417 --> 00:41:53.792
This girl's gonna be the death of me.

921
00:42:02.792 --> 00:42:04.000
- Hey.
- Hey.

922
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.375
Wanna take the north side?

923
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:06.917
- Yeah. sure.

924
00:42:08.292 --> 00:42:09.125
- Ugh.

925
00:42:09.125 --> 00:42:11.625
- They do know that's
the south east side. right?

926
00:42:12.458 --> 00:42:14.500
- No. but it is so hot
that you do.

927
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:15.333
- You're so hot.

928
00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:16.875
- You are so hot.
- You are.

929
00:42:16.875 --> 00:42:17.958
- We are.
- We are.

930
00:42:17.958 --> 00:42:18.625
- We are.

931
00:42:18.625 --> 00:42:19.458
We are.

932
00:42:19.458 --> 00:42:20.625
We are. We are.

933
00:42:20.625 --> 00:42:22.875
Oh. I'm glad
you have each other.

934
00:42:26.208 --> 00:42:27.000
- Hello?

935
00:42:28.375 --> 00:42:29.708
- Oh shit.
- Sorry.

936
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.292
Ooh.

937
00:42:34.292 --> 00:42:35.958
You know I like it
when you grab my ass.

938
00:42:37.708 --> 00:42:40.625
- Well. on the upside.
if you can't find KingPun.

939
00:42:40.625 --> 00:42:43.042
it's kind of like a cool badge
of honor to get suspended.

940
00:42:45.208 --> 00:42:47.667
- So you usually go for people
who get suspended?

941
00:42:48.708 --> 00:42:52.333
- Um. I don't really have a type.
It's more of just a vibe.

942
00:42:52.875 --> 00:42:55.542
- So your vibe is Aya then. huh?

943
00:42:55.917 --> 00:42:57.750
- Well. actually.
we just broke up.

944
00:42:58.542 --> 00:42:59.333
- Oh really?

945
00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.333
That sucks. Sorry.

946
00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:04.167
Are you over them?

947
00:43:04.708 --> 00:43:07.083
- Depends. Paige. Who's asking?

948
00:43:07.083 --> 00:43:08.875
- Not me. I don't care.

949
00:43:08.875 --> 00:43:10.167
- Ouch.

950
00:43:12.708 --> 00:43:13.542
- I care.

951
00:43:14.292 --> 00:43:15.125
I care.

952
00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:19.375
I just was trying to be nice
and ask you questions. So--

953
00:43:20.208 --> 00:43:21.750
Not that good at that though.

954
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:23.458
- Well. your questions are cute. So--

955
00:43:25.708 --> 00:43:28.583
- Do you remember in fifth grade
when we were partnered up

956
00:43:28.583 --> 00:43:31.833
to take care of that egg together
in Ms. Higgins' class?

957
00:43:32.542 --> 00:43:33.625
- Oh yeah.

958
00:43:33.625 --> 00:43:35.208
I'm pretty sure I dropped mine
on the first day

959
00:43:35.208 --> 00:43:36.958
and begged my mom
to replace it for me.

960
00:43:37.458 --> 00:43:39.250
Geez. I totally forgot
you were my partner for that.

961
00:43:39.875 --> 00:43:41.333
Damn. I was a shitty mom.

962
00:43:41.667 --> 00:43:43.375
- Well. if it's any consolation.

963
00:43:43.375 --> 00:43:47.292
I gave our egg a bath.
and I boiled it to death.

964
00:43:47.292 --> 00:43:50.583
So guess I wasn't
a perfect mom either.

965
00:43:51.417 --> 00:43:52.583
Oh. hide.

966
00:43:52.583 --> 00:43:53.875
- It's gotta KingPun.

967
00:43:53.875 --> 00:43:55.417
- Aren't we supposed
to be confronting them?

968
00:43:55.417 --> 00:43:57.292
- Yes. I'm just not good at confrontation.

969
00:43:57.292 --> 00:43:58.167
- Clearly.

970
00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:04.667
Kind of weird
that we've co-parented

971
00:44:04.667 --> 00:44:06.458
and never kissed before. huh?

972
00:44:07.042 --> 00:44:09.208
- Yeah. It's a little bit strange.

973
00:44:09.917 --> 00:44:11.625
- Well. maybe we should try it.

974
00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:13.250
- We could try it.

975
00:44:16.833 --> 00:44:18.542
- You can lean in now.

976
00:44:18.542 --> 00:44:19.667
- Yeah. Right.

977
00:44:23.542 --> 00:44:24.500
- Sorry.

978
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.792
- That was awkward.

979
00:44:33.583 --> 00:44:34.708
Oh shit. they're leaving.

980
00:44:36.667 --> 00:44:38.333
Hey! Wait! Stop!

981
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:42.417
- Yo. I cannot believe
that your stupid stakeout idea

982
00:44:42.417 --> 00:44:44.333
might have actually worked.
but that was definitely Tim's car.

983
00:44:44.333 --> 00:44:45.042
- How do you know?

984
00:44:45.042 --> 00:44:47.083
- Who else drives
a bright green Challenger

985
00:44:47.083 --> 00:44:49.417
with a bumper sticker that reads
"Your mom calls me daddy"?

986
00:44:49.417 --> 00:44:50.667
- Fucking Tim.

987
00:44:50.667 --> 00:44:51.500
Mm-hmm.

988
00:44:52.958 --> 00:44:55.250
- Uh. hold on.
I have to take this.

989
00:44:57.167 --> 00:44:58.667
- So do you think
you cracked the case?

990
00:45:00.208 --> 00:45:02.250
- Yeah. I guess so.

991
00:45:08.167 --> 00:45:10.250
Paige. let's go.
We're gonna be late.

992
00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:13.000
Are you seriously not packed
for our away meet yet?

993
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.167
- I started.

994
00:45:16.208 --> 00:45:17.750
Dillon. I need
to tell you something.

995
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:18.625
- What. what happened?

996
00:45:18.625 --> 00:45:20.458
- Don't make it a big deal. Okay.

997
00:45:20.458 --> 00:45:21.833
- What happened?

998
00:45:22.125 --> 00:45:24.083
Did you find another one
of your mom's special movies?

999
00:45:25.458 --> 00:45:27.417
- Gabby and I kissed.

1000
00:45:27.417 --> 00:45:29.083
- I'm sorry. what?

1001
00:45:29.083 --> 00:45:30.125
- I know.

1002
00:45:30.542 --> 00:45:33.042
- Wait. Gabriela Campos kissed you.

1003
00:45:34.458 --> 00:45:36.083
Okay. Screw packing.
Tell me exactly what happened.

1004
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.125
- I don't know. It kind of
just happened at the stakeout.

1005
00:45:39.125 --> 00:45:42.083
It was really weird. actually.

1006
00:45:42.083 --> 00:45:43.083
- What do you mean weird?

1007
00:45:43.083 --> 00:45:45.292
You've been waiting for this. like.
literally your entire life.

1008
00:45:45.292 --> 00:45:46.125
You're obsessed with her.

1009
00:45:46.125 --> 00:45:48.000
- Well. it was very anti-climactic.

1010
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.458
- Was it a bad kiss?

1011
00:45:49.917 --> 00:45:51.958
Is that her fatal flaw?
Does she have an Achilles tongue?

1012
00:45:51.958 --> 00:45:54.875
- Maybe it wasn't her.
It was probably me.

1013
00:45:54.875 --> 00:45:57.583
- That makes more sense.
She's kissed a lot of people. Yeah.

1014
00:45:57.583 --> 00:45:59.875
- Shit! I haven't kissed anyone.
I don't know how to kiss.

1015
00:45:59.875 --> 00:46:00.917
- Yeah. You're probably
a terrible kisser.

1016
00:46:00.917 --> 00:46:02.333
- You need to teach me.
- No.

1017
00:46:02.333 --> 00:46:03.542
- Teach me.
- What. ew!

1018
00:46:03.542 --> 00:46:05.125
God. are you seriously trying
to kiss me right now?

1019
00:46:05.125 --> 00:46:06.708
- Just kiss me please. Come on.

1020
00:46:06.708 --> 00:46:08.583
- No means no. Paige.
Come on.

1021
00:46:08.583 --> 00:46:09.917
You're not a man.
Thank you.

1022
00:46:09.917 --> 00:46:12.000
- Why are you so dressed up?

1023
00:46:12.458 --> 00:46:15.542
- It's a structured blazer.
Everybody quit tripping.

1024
00:46:15.542 --> 00:46:16.458
Come on. Let's go.

1025
00:46:17.458 --> 00:46:18.458
Did you pack us the food?

1026
00:46:20.833 --> 00:46:23.875
Ugh. I can't believe
I'm such a bad kisser.

1027
00:46:23.875 --> 00:46:25.000
- Oh no. no. no. no.

1028
00:46:25.375 --> 00:46:28.750
Bad kisser. that is impossible.
Not possible.

1029
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:32.125
The Evans women
are legendary kissers.

1030
00:46:32.125 --> 00:46:34.958
Your grandmother won the Frenching contest
three years running.

1031
00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:36.292
- Oh my god.
- I placed second.

1032
00:46:36.292 --> 00:46:38.167
- What?
- I've told you about this?

1033
00:46:38.167 --> 00:46:39.750
I tied with
your great aunt Janine.

1034
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:42.000
Oh my god.
she is a maniac.

1035
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.250
- Wow. I guess the promiscuous gene
skips a generation.

1036
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:45.458
- That's what they say.

1037
00:46:45.458 --> 00:46:48.833
- Do you think maybe
it's not the kiss. it's the person?

1038
00:46:48.833 --> 00:46:49.875
- Oh.
- What does that mean?

1039
00:46:50.292 --> 00:46:53.167
- Maybe you were let down by the kiss
because your crush has run its course.

1040
00:46:53.458 --> 00:46:55.250
- But I've liked Gabby forever.

1041
00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:57.250
- Might think that maybe
there are other people out there.

1042
00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:58.458
- Yeah.
- Like who?

1043
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.875
- Hi. Mrs. Evans. Miss. Sorry.

1044
00:47:01.875 --> 00:47:03.750
- Hey. AJ.
- AJ.

1045
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:08.542
Wow. Finally. we meet after hearing
about you 24/7 from this one.

1046
00:47:08.542 --> 00:47:09.833
- She's being sarcastic.

1047
00:47:09.833 --> 00:47:12.125
- I mean. the word constantly
springs to mind.

1048
00:47:12.125 --> 00:47:14.667
- Um. what are you gonna do now that
the antisocial artist is out of the house?

1049
00:47:14.667 --> 00:47:17.417
- Oh man.
So many possibilities.

1050
00:47:17.417 --> 00:47:18.833
I mean. the sky's the limit. right?

1051
00:47:18.833 --> 00:47:21.375
I'm not gonna crumble.
That's the one thing I'm not gonna do.

1052
00:47:21.375 --> 00:47:22.250
- We're gone for a night.

1053
00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:23.500
- I know. Well. it doesn't matter.

1054
00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.083
I'm not gonna crumble. So--

1055
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:27.542
Hey. AJ. um.
do me a favor

1056
00:47:27.542 --> 00:47:30.250
and try to get old Paige here
to loosen up a little bit.

1057
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:31.292
Okay.

1058
00:47:31.292 --> 00:47:32.500
You know. like.

1059
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:36.000
fire up a bong and knock back
a couple of wine coolers.

1060
00:47:36.375 --> 00:47:38.958
Oh my god. I have poppers in the car.
Should I run? Grab?

1061
00:47:38.958 --> 00:47:41.333
- No. That's the wrong type of gay.

1062
00:47:41.333 --> 00:47:44.708
- Well. hello there.
Long time. no see.

1063
00:47:44.708 --> 00:47:47.667
- A little delayed gratification
never hurt anyone.

1064
00:47:47.667 --> 00:47:48.333
- Okay.

1065
00:47:48.333 --> 00:47:50.208
So you making me wait.

1066
00:47:50.208 --> 00:47:52.375
- They call it edging these days.

1067
00:47:52.375 --> 00:47:53.917
I looked it up on Wikipedia.

1068
00:47:53.917 --> 00:47:57.125
and the definition is quite rank.

1069
00:47:57.125 --> 00:47:59.917
- I don't know the meaning
of rank. but I believe you.

1070
00:47:59.917 --> 00:48:02.042
- It means filthy dirty.

1071
00:48:02.042 --> 00:48:05.500
- Well. I'm gonna just get your number
off the emergency contact list.

1072
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.875
- Okay. I've had
your number for. like.

1073
00:48:07.875 --> 00:48:09.167
I don't know how many days.

1074
00:48:09.167 --> 00:48:10.167
Go with the program. Okay.

1075
00:48:10.667 --> 00:48:12.958
I mean. text me.
Like. I'm not getting any younger.

1076
00:48:12.958 --> 00:48:13.917
Come on.

1077
00:48:15.917 --> 00:48:16.583
- Let's go!

1078
00:48:17.042 --> 00:48:18.292
Here are you room keys. sir.

1079
00:48:19.292 --> 00:48:20.875
Quiet hours start at00.

1080
00:48:30.958 --> 00:48:34.042
- Okay. Listen up. hormonal teens.

1081
00:48:34.625 --> 00:48:37.333
Now on this list is the name
of your roommate.

1082
00:48:37.333 --> 00:48:39.750
I know that 60 percent
of you are queer.

1083
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.958
but. guys. don't go
in the girls' room.

1084
00:48:42.958 --> 00:48:45.375
And. girls. please don't go
in the guys' room.

1085
00:48:45.375 --> 00:48:47.292
We don't want anybody getting pregnant.

1086
00:48:47.292 --> 00:48:49.875
And I'm talking specifically
to you. Stacey and Dillon.

1087
00:48:49.875 --> 00:48:51.417
- What? We would never.

1088
00:48:51.417 --> 00:48:53.583
- One. as I made it clear
on my campaign trail.

1089
00:48:53.583 --> 00:48:55.458
I will not be allowing
the administration to control

1090
00:48:55.458 --> 00:48:56.500
what I do with my body.

1091
00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.542
Two. Obviously. I'm on birth control.

1092
00:48:58.542 --> 00:48:59.833
- Well. I'm on team control.

1093
00:48:59.833 --> 00:49:02.958
and I want lights out
by00 p. m.

1094
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:07.833
I have a FaceTime date
with a very lovely lady.

1095
00:49:08.125 --> 00:49:09.833
I don't want to be interrupted.

1096
00:49:09.833 --> 00:49:11.250
And Paige. no graffiti.

1097
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:12.417
- Your new stepdad.
- Ugh.

1098
00:49:14.042 --> 00:49:14.917
- Hey.

1099
00:49:14.917 --> 00:49:15.667
- Hi.

1100
00:49:15.667 --> 00:49:16.792
- We should talk.

1101
00:49:17.583 --> 00:49:19.208
- Hey. guess we're rooming together.

1102
00:49:19.208 --> 00:49:20.125
Can't get rid of you.

1103
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.667
- Um. I'm gonna go find out
who my roommate is.

1104
00:49:22.667 --> 00:49:23.750
but I'll see you later.

1105
00:49:26.083 --> 00:49:28.458
- Did you know
that squirrels remember

1106
00:49:28.458 --> 00:49:30.125
every single person
they've ever seen?

1107
00:49:30.625 --> 00:49:33.083
- What?
- They have photographic memories.

1108
00:49:33.083 --> 00:49:34.333
- Mm-hmm.

1109
00:49:34.333 --> 00:49:36.875
Uh. I look forward to hearing
more animal facts tonight.

1110
00:49:36.875 --> 00:49:38.750
Oh good. 'Cause there are so plenty.

1111
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.042
- Guys. team party.
My room.30. Be there.

1112
00:49:42.042 --> 00:49:43.750
- No. you guys heard coach.
We. we can't do that.

1113
00:49:44.208 --> 00:49:45.292
- Oh no.

1114
00:49:45.667 --> 00:49:46.750
Yeah. we definitely can't do that.

1115
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.167
Especially since our track meet starts
at00 p. m.. right?

1116
00:49:49.625 --> 00:49:51.250
Looks like we're getting
fucked up tonight.

1117
00:49:51.958 --> 00:49:53.792
- Oh Paige. You're so innocent.

1118
00:49:57.833 --> 00:50:02.000
- Okay. This one is either whiskey or rum.

1119
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.875
Then we've got peach vodka.
We've got lemon vodka.

1120
00:50:05.875 --> 00:50:06.875
- Wiper fluid?

1121
00:50:06.875 --> 00:50:08.042
- More vodka.

1122
00:50:08.042 --> 00:50:09.542
And we got mouthwash.

1123
00:50:09.542 --> 00:50:11.500
but you just gotta drink
a lot of it to get fucked up.

1124
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.583
- Mm. that looks the least risky.

1125
00:50:13.583 --> 00:50:15.458
- Is that all you could get
from your parents?

1126
00:50:15.458 --> 00:50:17.667
- Yeah. Well. look.
my beard is coming in

1127
00:50:17.667 --> 00:50:19.667
so it's only a matter of time
before I stop getting carded.

1128
00:50:19.667 --> 00:50:21.083
- Oh yeah. for sure.

1129
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.750
-Yo. Tim!
- Hey.

1130
00:50:23.625 --> 00:50:24.583
- There he is.

1131
00:50:25.667 --> 00:50:27.125
- You know. you actually have
to confront Tim

1132
00:50:27.125 --> 00:50:28.917
about being KingPun
to accuse him. right?

1133
00:50:28.917 --> 00:50:30.375
- I've been working up to it.

1134
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.875
- She really scares me sometimes.

1135
00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:34.000
- Tim.

1136
00:50:34.417 --> 00:50:36.333
I know you're KingPun.
I have your notebook.

1137
00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:37.167
- What?

1138
00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:39.875
- I saw you after school
the other night. Okay.

1139
00:50:39.875 --> 00:50:42.583
What were you doing there
if not to get your notebook?

1140
00:50:42.583 --> 00:50:43.583
Okay. okay. okay.

1141
00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:45.417
I'll tell you.

1142
00:50:46.167 --> 00:50:47.542
I'm in Renaissance club.

1143
00:50:47.875 --> 00:50:49.000
- Come again?

1144
00:50:49.583 --> 00:50:52.375
- I'm in Renaissance club.
I'm a Rennie. if you will.

1145
00:50:52.375 --> 00:50:53.875
- Oh my god.

1146
00:50:53.875 --> 00:50:55.917
- We were having
our monthly feast.

1147
00:50:55.917 --> 00:50:57.333
And when I got to school.

1148
00:50:58.500 --> 00:50:59.542
well. it was canceled.

1149
00:50:59.542 --> 00:51:01.250
- I don't believe you.

1150
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:02.250
- Are you serious?

1151
00:51:03.458 --> 00:51:04.167
Look.

1152
00:51:07.625 --> 00:51:08.458
- Wow.

1153
00:51:08.458 --> 00:51:13.083
- Okay. Everyone gather around.
it is game time.

1154
00:51:13.083 --> 00:51:14.250
- We have to play some games.

1155
00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:18.167
- Still got a... lot
of questions for you.

1156
00:51:18.167 --> 00:51:19.750
- I got a lot of answers.

1157
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:20.625
- A lot of questions.

1158
00:51:24.292 --> 00:51:25.917
- Hey.
- Hey.

1159
00:51:25.917 --> 00:51:28.000
- Perfect timing. We're about
to play seven minutes.

1160
00:51:29.417 --> 00:51:32.208
- What? Like seven minutes in heaven?

1161
00:51:32.208 --> 00:51:34.458
- No. That perpetuates
a Christian narrative.

1162
00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:36.292
We're playing seven minutes
in the hotel bathroom.

1163
00:51:36.292 --> 00:51:37.083
and it's a track tradition.

1164
00:51:38.125 --> 00:51:41.083
Okay. everyone. phones in.
pride at the door.

1165
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:44.250
- For any new additions.
the rules are simple.

1166
00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:46.500
You put your phone in the bag
and if your phone gets picked.

1167
00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.292
you have to go into the bathroom
with another person.

1168
00:51:48.625 --> 00:51:50.042
And since this is 2022.

1169
00:51:50.042 --> 00:51:52.458
we will not force anyone
to make out if you don't want to.

1170
00:51:52.458 --> 00:51:54.458
But I will say seven minutes is
such a long time

1171
00:51:54.458 --> 00:51:56.208
to be in the bathroom
with someone and not make out.

1172
00:51:56.208 --> 00:51:57.875
Just saying. Paige.
- Okay? Alright.

1173
00:51:58.292 --> 00:52:01.292
Everyone's phones are in.
Alright.

1174
00:52:01.292 --> 00:52:03.167
First phone is--

1175
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:35.083
Oh!

1176
00:52:35.083 --> 00:52:35.958
- Paige!

1177
00:52:35.958 --> 00:52:38.833
I believe this questionable
phone case belongs to you.

1178
00:52:39.375 --> 00:52:40.625
- No.
Yes.

1179
00:52:40.625 --> 00:52:41.833
Now let's see.

1180
00:52:45.917 --> 00:52:47.000
Whose case is this?

1181
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.125
That'd be mine.

1182
00:52:50.792 --> 00:52:51.833
- What's your background?

1183
00:52:51.833 --> 00:52:53.500
- Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie.

1184
00:52:55.542 --> 00:52:56.750
- AJ. It's you.

1185
00:52:57.458 --> 00:52:58.958
Come on. Get in there.

1186
00:52:59.333 --> 00:53:00.833
Come on. Let's go.

1187
00:53:01.458 --> 00:53:03.417
Rules are rules.
We don't make the rules.

1188
00:53:03.417 --> 00:53:04.667
They're just the rules.

1189
00:53:04.667 --> 00:53:06.625
Have fun.

1190
00:53:06.625 --> 00:53:09.042
- Use the dental dams.

1191
00:53:14.792 --> 00:53:15.667
Oh. I got one.

1192
00:53:17.375 --> 00:53:20.000
Did you know that pandas

1193
00:53:20.458 --> 00:53:23.625
fake their pregnancies
to get extra food?

1194
00:53:24.083 --> 00:53:27.542
- Oh wow. Another random animal fact.

1195
00:53:27.542 --> 00:53:28.958
So soon?

1196
00:53:29.375 --> 00:53:31.708
- I know. I'm just nervous.

1197
00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:33.292
Don't you kind of know me by now.

1198
00:53:34.458 --> 00:53:36.125
- Yeah. I kind of do.

1199
00:53:36.958 --> 00:53:39.083
Okay. Let me think of.

1200
00:53:39.542 --> 00:53:43.958
of random animal fact
while you get yourself together.

1201
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:45.708
- Psst.

1202
00:53:47.292 --> 00:53:50.458
You could also just
tell me something real.

1203
00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:54.125
- Yeah.

1204
00:53:54.708 --> 00:53:55.792
Okay. Yeah.

1205
00:53:58.458 --> 00:53:59.875
Um--

1206
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:04.125
I'm terrified of flying.

1207
00:54:05.458 --> 00:54:06.833
- Is that all you're giving me?

1208
00:54:06.833 --> 00:54:08.917
- Yes. Well. I don't. I just.

1209
00:54:08.917 --> 00:54:13.042
I don't think that humans
are meant to sit in chairs

1210
00:54:13.042 --> 00:54:14.292
in the sky. you know.

1211
00:54:14.292 --> 00:54:16.958
Like. like. that's messed up.
if you think about it.

1212
00:54:16.958 --> 00:54:18.792
- Damn.

1213
00:54:18.792 --> 00:54:21.458
We are bad at
the small talk thing.

1214
00:54:22.667 --> 00:54:23.583
- I tried.

1215
00:54:24.042 --> 00:54:26.833
- But at least it's better
than us awkwardly making out.

1216
00:54:26.833 --> 00:54:27.667
- Yeah.

1217
00:54:27.667 --> 00:54:29.500
I mean. what. can.
can you imagine.

1218
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.625
what. suddenly
we're hardcore making out?

1219
00:54:31.625 --> 00:54:34.500
- Mm. That just sounds
- Come on.

1220
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:35.417
- really crazy.

1221
00:54:35.417 --> 00:54:36.667
- It. it would be hilarious.

1222
00:54:36.667 --> 00:54:40.375
- It would be just super funny.

1223
00:54:40.375 --> 00:54:41.250
- Yeah.

1224
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:43.833
Funny. like this being
my first kiss.

1225
00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:46.167
- Very funny.

1226
00:54:50.083 --> 00:54:52.083
- I know everyone makes
assumptions about me.

1227
00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:55.292
The mysterious AJ Campos.

1228
00:54:56.083 --> 00:54:58.292
Brooding. leather jacket type.

1229
00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:02.125
but. um. no.
never kissed anyone.

1230
00:55:02.833 --> 00:55:03.875
Ever.

1231
00:55:05.583 --> 00:55:07.667
I guess we have that lack
of experience in common.

1232
00:55:08.667 --> 00:55:09.458
- Yeah.

1233
00:55:12.333 --> 00:55:13.833
But why haven't you?

1234
00:55:13.833 --> 00:55:15.333
I mean. I'm sure that.

1235
00:55:15.333 --> 00:55:17.792
you know.
people probably want to.

1236
00:55:17.792 --> 00:55:19.167
- I'm not opposed to it.

1237
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.625
- I'm not opposed to it either.

1238
00:55:22.833 --> 00:55:23.750
- Kissing someone?

1239
00:55:24.875 --> 00:55:26.000
- Kissing you.

1240
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:27.458
- Oh.

1241
00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.750
- Do you think that
this is gonna be awkward later?

1242
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:58.042
- No. I really don't think so.

1243
00:56:00.333 --> 00:56:01.625
- Do you have enough blanket?
- Do you have enough room?

1244
00:56:03.917 --> 00:56:05.250
We're being weird about this.

1245
00:56:05.708 --> 00:56:06.833
Yeah.

1246
00:56:07.375 --> 00:56:09.083
And this really does not have
to be weird.

1247
00:56:09.458 --> 00:56:10.292
- No.

1248
00:56:11.292 --> 00:56:12.125
It doesn't.

1249
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.792
I honestly don't think
I'm gonna be able to fall asleep.

1250
00:56:22.792 --> 00:56:25.625
Like. my mind is racing
from this whole CalArts thing.

1251
00:56:26.333 --> 00:56:28.583
- You're really lucky your mom is
so supportive of you being--

1252
00:56:28.583 --> 00:56:29.292
- Gay.

1253
00:56:29.833 --> 00:56:31.542
- No. I'm gonna say an artist.

1254
00:56:31.958 --> 00:56:33.917
- Oh.
- I do. Yeah.

1255
00:56:35.042 --> 00:56:37.583
I feel like I would never pursue
something like that.

1256
00:56:38.083 --> 00:56:39.458
- Because of your parents?

1257
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.750
- Like... to them.

1258
00:56:43.458 --> 00:56:45.292
everything artistic is a risk.

1259
00:56:46.583 --> 00:56:49.583
Which I. I guess I get.

1260
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:52.458
- What did they say
when you came out?

1261
00:56:53.375 --> 00:56:55.333
- When I told my mom I was bi.

1262
00:56:55.333 --> 00:56:57.083
she didn't really say anything.

1263
00:56:57.750 --> 00:57:00.167
But when Gabby came out.

1264
00:57:00.167 --> 00:57:02.125
she made it pretty impossible
to ignore.

1265
00:57:03.625 --> 00:57:07.458
She did it at her 14th birthday party.
Like. at the party.

1266
00:57:07.458 --> 00:57:08.750
- Oh wow.
- Yeah.

1267
00:57:09.542 --> 00:57:11.875
I think my abuela was gonna puke.

1268
00:57:14.083 --> 00:57:15.667
- Is it hard having a twin?

1269
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:19.083
- I mean. I love her.

1270
00:57:19.833 --> 00:57:22.917
and we have this
really special. cool bond.

1271
00:57:23.542 --> 00:57:25.833
But Gabby's also
painfully charming.

1272
00:57:25.833 --> 00:57:28.458
and everyone's obsessed
with her.

1273
00:57:31.917 --> 00:57:34.583
It's just an impossible comparison
to live up to. you know.

1274
00:57:38.792 --> 00:57:41.292
That was a lot. I don't know
why I told you all that.

1275
00:57:41.292 --> 00:57:42.292
- It wasn't a lot.

1276
00:57:43.208 --> 00:57:44.208
I'm glad you told me.

1277
00:57:45.708 --> 00:57:46.875
- But what about you?

1278
00:57:48.042 --> 00:57:49.958
Is it hard growing up with just your mom?

1279
00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:54.333
- Mm. sometimes. but not really.

1280
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:58.042
I just love her so much.

1281
00:57:59.625 --> 00:58:01.583
Mm. she's like my best friend.

1282
00:58:01.583 --> 00:58:03.583
- Aw.
- Don't tell her that though.

1283
00:58:03.583 --> 00:58:05.167
She wants it too much.

1284
00:58:07.542 --> 00:58:09.667
One day. she just decided
she wanted a kid.

1285
00:58:09.667 --> 00:58:13.625
so she got some sperm
and she did it herself.

1286
00:58:14.917 --> 00:58:17.292
- That's pretty badass.

1287
00:58:19.458 --> 00:58:21.792
Now I know where you get
your confidence from.

1288
00:58:21.792 --> 00:58:23.500
- What are you talking about?

1289
00:58:25.125 --> 00:58:28.500
You're the one who has the whole
quiet confident thing going on.

1290
00:58:30.167 --> 00:58:31.958
Nobody ever knows
what you're thinking.

1291
00:58:33.833 --> 00:58:34.875
including me.

1292
00:58:35.208 --> 00:58:36.167
- Hey.

1293
00:58:38.083 --> 00:58:39.083
I'm working on it.

1294
00:59:06.958 --> 00:59:07.625
- We should--

1295
00:59:07.958 --> 00:59:10.250
- Yeah. you're right. we should
probably get some sleep.

1296
00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:11.917
- Yeah. Yeah.

1297
00:59:18.458 --> 00:59:19.292
- Okay.

1298
00:59:33.125 --> 00:59:34.333
Good night. Paige.

1299
00:59:36.292 --> 00:59:37.500
- Night. AJ.

1300
01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:35.458
I've asked you nicely.

1301
01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:37.875
All I wanted was
some Cheetos.

1302
01:00:38.958 --> 01:00:42.458
Hey. give me my food!

1303
01:00:45.083 --> 01:00:46.417
- Hey.

1304
01:00:46.417 --> 01:00:47.792
- Hey!

1305
01:00:47.792 --> 01:00:49.708
Oh my god. thank god you're here.

1306
01:00:50.625 --> 01:00:52.875
- Gabby. drunk Gabby.

1307
01:00:53.792 --> 01:00:55.708
- The stupid vending machine
won't give me my food.

1308
01:00:58.333 --> 01:00:59.333
- I got you.

1309
01:00:59.333 --> 01:01:00.458
- Wow.

1310
01:01:01.583 --> 01:01:03.458
I'm telling you. listen.

1311
01:01:03.458 --> 01:01:05.458
I've tried this
so many times tonight.

1312
01:01:05.458 --> 01:01:06.917
and it has not happened.

1313
01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:08.292
I mean. I don't know--

1314
01:01:08.292 --> 01:01:09.000
Oh.

1315
01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:11.875
Food!

1316
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.708
Thank you.

1317
01:01:14.708 --> 01:01:16.458
It's so crazy.

1318
01:01:16.458 --> 01:01:18.208
- I'm gonna walk you
to your room. okay.

1319
01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:20.042
- If you wanna walk me back
to my room. Paige.

1320
01:01:20.042 --> 01:01:21.083
then that's what we're gonna do.

1321
01:01:21.792 --> 01:01:23.292
- I'm gonna do that.
- Alright.

1322
01:01:24.042 --> 01:01:25.583
Remember.

1323
01:01:25.583 --> 01:01:28.000
remember when I told you
that me and Aya broke up?

1324
01:01:28.708 --> 01:01:29.333
- Yeah.

1325
01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:33.333
- Well. it actually turns out
that they broke up with me.

1326
01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:37.000
No one knows that though.

1327
01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:39.292
Gabby Campos got dumped.

1328
01:01:39.292 --> 01:01:40.625
Shh.

1329
01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:44.917
- Are you okay?

1330
01:01:46.125 --> 01:01:49.042
- Um. yeah. I am--

1331
01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:51.958
I'm not.

1332
01:01:53.542 --> 01:01:55.667
You're good at making me
feel better though.

1333
01:01:56.792 --> 01:01:59.917
- I can't. I can't.
I can't. I'm sorry.

1334
01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:01.458
- Why don't you want to kiss me?

1335
01:02:03.958 --> 01:02:05.250
Why does no one want
to kiss me?

1336
01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:08.000
- I'm sorry. I just have
a crush on somebody else.

1337
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:13.208
- Story of my life.
am I right?

1338
01:02:17.042 --> 01:02:17.833
- Gabby?

1339
01:02:21.167 --> 01:02:23.875
It's a froyo loyalty card.

1340
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:26.583
- Yeah.

1341
01:02:28.833 --> 01:02:30.458
that it is.

1342
01:02:32.458 --> 01:02:34.250
See ya later. alligator.

1343
01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:36.333
- Good night.

1344
01:02:56.042 --> 01:02:57.458
AJ. are you awake?

1345
01:03:03.333 --> 01:03:05.917
Well. friends.
it doesn't get any bigger than this.

1346
01:03:05.917 --> 01:03:09.417
We're here at the historic
Central Square Track and Field.

1347
01:03:09.417 --> 01:03:11.500
and we've got a big one today.

1348
01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.583
And this is the stuff
dreams are made of.

1349
01:03:13.583 --> 01:03:16.250
but also nightmares
if you're not in the top three.

1350
01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:18.917
- It goes by so fast.
like childhood.

1351
01:03:18.917 --> 01:03:20.958
I just hope that everybody takes
every moment in

1352
01:03:21.458 --> 01:03:23.042
and makes it special.

1353
01:03:23.042 --> 01:03:25.375
- Now some would say
there are no losers here today.

1354
01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:26.333
Is that true?
- No.

1355
01:03:26.333 --> 01:03:27.792
- Fantastic.

1356
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:30.458
- The polls say
you're two points behind.

1357
01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:31.583
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1358
01:03:31.583 --> 01:03:32.375
-I wouldn't trust the polls.

1359
01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.875
especially when they're run
by two freshmen

1360
01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:34.750
who have crushes on you.

1361
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:36.542
- Okay. Todd and Harry did
the best they can

1362
01:03:36.542 --> 01:03:37.500
with the resources they have.

1363
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.833
- Mm-hmm. yeah?
"The best they can?"

1364
01:03:38.833 --> 01:03:40.208
Are they?
Are they really?

1365
01:03:40.208 --> 01:03:41.333
- Guys. emergency.

1366
01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:42.875
Have you guys seen AJ?

1367
01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:44.542
I tried to sit next to her on the bus.
but then Coach cornered me

1368
01:03:44.542 --> 01:03:45.792
to talk about my mom's food preferences.

1369
01:03:45.792 --> 01:03:46.542
- No. why?

1370
01:03:46.542 --> 01:03:47.917
You have that anxious-sweating

1371
01:03:47.917 --> 01:03:49.333
through-your-clinical-strength
deodorant look in your eye.

1372
01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:50.500
- AJ and I kissed last night.

1373
01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.667
- Shut up!
- What?

1374
01:03:51.667 --> 01:03:53.542
- And then Gabby tried
to kiss me. again.

1375
01:03:53.542 --> 01:03:54.583
- Oh my god.
- Oh no.

1376
01:03:54.583 --> 01:03:56.458
- And I'm freaking out because AJ thinks

1377
01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:58.250
it was both of our first kisses.
but it wasn't.

1378
01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:00.625
My first kiss was with Gabby.
and I don't know what to do

1379
01:04:00.625 --> 01:04:02.958
because I actually like AJ.

1380
01:04:02.958 --> 01:04:03.833
- No shit.

1381
01:04:03.833 --> 01:04:04.542
- Dillon.

1382
01:04:06.125 --> 01:04:08.250
our kiss was really real.

1383
01:04:08.792 --> 01:04:10.958
You know what I'm saying?
It was really good.

1384
01:04:10.958 --> 01:04:13.042
- Okay. uh. Paige.
take. take a deep breath

1385
01:04:13.042 --> 01:04:14.958
'cause you can't have
an orgasm on the field.

1386
01:04:14.958 --> 01:04:16.417
- I just don't know what to do.

1387
01:04:16.417 --> 01:04:18.000
I don't want her to think
that it didn't matter.

1388
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.625
And I don't want her think
that I like her sister. I don't.

1389
01:04:20.625 --> 01:04:21.917
I don't want her to hate me.

1390
01:04:21.917 --> 01:04:24.792
We were talking all night.
and I really don't want her to hate me.

1391
01:04:26.042 --> 01:04:28.167
Four by 100 relay teams.

1392
01:04:28.167 --> 01:04:29.667
please report to the starting line!

1393
01:04:29.667 --> 01:04:30.750
- What am I gonna do?

1394
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:33.375
- Um. okay. well. first of all.

1395
01:04:33.375 --> 01:04:35.167
you're gonna run the race

1396
01:04:35.167 --> 01:04:37.042
and hopefully
you won't trip and fall.

1397
01:04:37.042 --> 01:04:38.917
and then we can figure out
what to say to AJ.

1398
01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:41.542
- I feel like I'm gonna shit my pants
like that marathon runner did.

1399
01:04:41.542 --> 01:04:42.458
- Shit your pants?

1400
01:04:42.458 --> 01:04:43.750
Please shit your pants.
that would be hilarious.

1401
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:46.125
- No. please don't shit your pants.
It's gonna slow us down.

1402
01:04:46.125 --> 01:04:47.792
- True. maybe don't shit your pants.

1403
01:04:47.792 --> 01:04:49.292
- And that's it for the javelin.

1404
01:04:49.292 --> 01:04:51.208
We're getting that young athlete
carted off the field.

1405
01:04:51.208 --> 01:04:52.208
I'm sure they'll be okay.

1406
01:04:52.208 --> 01:04:55.167
They're doing amazing things now
with blood platelet therapy.

1407
01:04:55.167 --> 01:04:57.708
And now we're on to the big one.

1408
01:04:57.708 --> 01:04:59.375
the granddaddy of them all.

1409
01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:01.375
the fastest 50 seconds
in sport.

1410
01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:03.583
the four by 100 meter relay.

1411
01:05:03.583 --> 01:05:06.500
Trigger warning.
there will be a gunshot to start.

1412
01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.250
but it's fake.

1413
01:05:09.708 --> 01:05:11.167
Runners. take your mark.

1414
01:05:29.667 --> 01:05:31.875
- How would you approach
a baton handoff?

1415
01:05:31.875 --> 01:05:32.833
- I'd go like this.

1416
01:05:33.667 --> 01:05:35.167
Okay. ready? Grab.

1417
01:05:35.667 --> 01:05:36.542
So I don't look.

1418
01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:38.417
I'll do it again.
- Ah. incredible.

1419
01:05:39.125 --> 01:05:40.833
Incredible.
And our hands did not touch.

1420
01:05:40.833 --> 01:05:42.042
- Oh. but you have to do it backwards.

1421
01:05:42.042 --> 01:05:43.750
Just picture this. but backwards.
- Okay.

1422
01:05:48.417 --> 01:05:49.375
On your mark!

1423
01:05:51.375 --> 01:05:52.375
Get set.

1424
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:03.583
Go. Gabby!

1425
01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:06.083
Go. go. go!

1426
01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:11.500
- Here we are with
the second leg of the race

1427
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.917
and for Miller High.
this is Gabriela Campos.

1428
01:06:13.917 --> 01:06:15.375
She's one of the captains.

1429
01:06:15.708 --> 01:06:17.250
- Look at 'em go. wow.

1430
01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:20.542
She's really. she's just.
she's just doing a lot of this.

1431
01:06:20.542 --> 01:06:21.333
- She's doing tons of this.

1432
01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:24.708
This is gonna be a crucial handoff here
to newcomer Paige Evans.

1433
01:06:24.708 --> 01:06:26.833
And they get it done!
And now Paige Evans is off.

1434
01:06:53.833 --> 01:06:56.500
Now look at Miller High.
they are neck and neck.

1435
01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:00.708
An absolute surprise.
Oh. the humanity of it all.

1436
01:07:00.708 --> 01:07:02.875
Incredible.
Linklater close behind.

1437
01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:04.167
Now ahead. going in the lead.

1438
01:07:04.167 --> 01:07:05.708
Miller High--

1439
01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:09.625
Miller High second place!

1440
01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:25.542
- Second place!

1441
01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:28.375
- Hey. can I talk to you
about last night?

1442
01:07:29.667 --> 01:07:30.708
- What about last night?

1443
01:07:31.417 --> 01:07:32.292
What happened last night?

1444
01:07:32.292 --> 01:07:34.417
- My drunk ass tried
to kiss Paige.

1445
01:07:34.792 --> 01:07:36.875
I'm sorry.
I should have asked

1446
01:07:36.875 --> 01:07:38.833
and not just assumed
because we kissed before.

1447
01:07:38.833 --> 01:07:41.667
but honestly I should probably apologize
for that kiss too.

1448
01:07:41.667 --> 01:07:43.208
I clearly don't deal
with breakups well.

1449
01:07:46.083 --> 01:07:47.250
- You all know about this?

1450
01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:48.292
- It's really not what--

1451
01:07:48.292 --> 01:07:49.042
- No. it's fine.

1452
01:07:49.042 --> 01:07:50.042
You don't have
to explain yourself.

1453
01:07:50.042 --> 01:07:51.542
- AJ. can we please talk?

1454
01:07:51.542 --> 01:07:53.125
- No. it's fine.

1455
01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:54.875
It was just a kiss. right?

1456
01:07:56.667 --> 01:07:58.292
And actually. I should be
apologizing to you.

1457
01:08:00.292 --> 01:08:02.208
I'm KingPun. so we're even.

1458
01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:03.458
- What?
- Oh shit.

1459
01:08:04.417 --> 01:08:05.458
- You guys like each other?

1460
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.000
- Gab. really. keep up please.

1461
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.708
- Shit.

1462
01:08:09.708 --> 01:08:11.083
AJ. wait!

1463
01:08:12.042 --> 01:08:13.958
- No. Paige. Paige.
Paige. Paige. Paige.

1464
01:08:14.417 --> 01:08:15.708
Give them a moment. okay.

1465
01:08:16.333 --> 01:08:17.167
It's okay.

1466
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:18.750
It's okay. It's okay.

1467
01:08:23.625 --> 01:08:24.625
- AJ. wait.

1468
01:08:24.625 --> 01:08:25.917
- Leave me alone. Gabby.

1469
01:08:25.917 --> 01:08:26.958
- Wait.

1470
01:08:26.958 --> 01:08:28.792
I didn't know you liked her. okay.

1471
01:08:28.792 --> 01:08:30.167
I never would've kissed her if I did.

1472
01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.542
- Yeah. I know.
but this always happens.

1473
01:08:32.542 --> 01:08:34.625
Every time I try
to make new friends

1474
01:08:34.625 --> 01:08:35.875
or just do my own thing.

1475
01:08:36.292 --> 01:08:37.792
people always think
of you first.

1476
01:08:37.792 --> 01:08:38.875
- I'm sorry.

1477
01:08:38.875 --> 01:08:41.583
- God. I was so stupid for thinking
this time was different.

1478
01:08:41.583 --> 01:08:42.917
- AJ. you're not stupid.

1479
01:08:43.333 --> 01:08:45.042
Paige isn't even into me.

1480
01:08:45.042 --> 01:08:46.750
She said she likes someone else.
I'm guessing you.

1481
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:49.125
- She never told me that.

1482
01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.583
- Just like you didn't tell me
you were KingPun.

1483
01:08:51.083 --> 01:08:53.417
I mean. what is going on with you?
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

1484
01:08:53.417 --> 01:08:55.917
- Because Mom and Dad would kill me
if they found out I was spending time

1485
01:08:55.917 --> 01:08:58.000
on literally anything
other than school or track.

1486
01:08:58.417 --> 01:09:00.000
let alone defacing the school.

1487
01:09:00.458 --> 01:09:02.542
- But it's me. AJ.

1488
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:04.208
- I know.

1489
01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:10.292
But everything I do is always
overshadowed by you. Gabs.

1490
01:09:11.875 --> 01:09:13.250
I needed something that was mine.

1491
01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:15.708
- How am I supposed to help you
if you don't tell me anything?

1492
01:09:15.708 --> 01:09:18.417
- Help me with what.
Mom and Dad?

1493
01:09:18.417 --> 01:09:20.417
- They're hard on me too.
you know.

1494
01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:21.917
- Oh. now this is about you. great.

1495
01:09:21.917 --> 01:09:22.833
- I'm sorry.

1496
01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:25.042
I didn't mean it.

1497
01:09:25.458 --> 01:09:26.917
- Listen. I will be fine.

1498
01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:30.125
Just let second place
feel like last today. okay.

1499
01:09:34.167 --> 01:09:35.000
Wow.

1500
01:09:35.625 --> 01:09:37.708
AJ is KingPun.

1501
01:09:38.083 --> 01:09:39.208
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

1502
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.542
I did not see that coming.

1503
01:09:42.333 --> 01:09:43.208
- Neither did I.

1504
01:09:45.333 --> 01:09:47.292
Thank you for getting me
my favorite. by the way.

1505
01:09:47.292 --> 01:09:48.458
- You're welcome.

1506
01:09:48.458 --> 01:09:51.292
I mean. I got it for both
of us. so I-- well. okay.

1507
01:09:52.917 --> 01:09:54.542
Um.

1508
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:57.917
so. I hate to bring this up.

1509
01:09:57.917 --> 01:10:00.708
but it's almost the end of the semester

1510
01:10:00.708 --> 01:10:02.917
and I was kind of a-wonderin'

1511
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:08.000
what you were planning to do
about the whole suspension thing.

1512
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.667
- Mm. I have no clue.

1513
01:10:09.667 --> 01:10:10.750
- Mm-hmm.

1514
01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:14.708
- I don't want to give AJ away
because her dad would be really upset.

1515
01:10:14.708 --> 01:10:17.750
but I also don't want to ruin
this whole CalArts thing.

1516
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:19.292
- Yeah. I get it.

1517
01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:21.875
- Everything is falling apart.

1518
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:24.917
She won't speak to me.

1519
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.792
She ignored me
the whole time on the bus.

1520
01:10:27.792 --> 01:10:29.750
and she doesn't answer
any of my texts.

1521
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:33.417
So... how am I supposed
to draw my happiest moment

1522
01:10:33.417 --> 01:10:35.292
when I'm the most depressed
I've ever been?

1523
01:10:36.292 --> 01:10:38.167
- Well. stop wondering

1524
01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:40.458
how you could have done
things differently. you know.

1525
01:10:40.458 --> 01:10:43.708
I mean. sometimes you just have
to let your feelings guide you.

1526
01:10:43.708 --> 01:10:45.083
That's all you can really do.

1527
01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:48.250
And then sometimes
your head and your heart

1528
01:10:49.167 --> 01:10:51.167
end up duking it out.

1529
01:10:51.167 --> 01:10:54.792
- Well. those two things
aren't really working right now. are they?

1530
01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:57.458
- She's gonna come around.
You've just got to give her some time.

1531
01:10:57.458 --> 01:10:59.042
That's the way this works.

1532
01:11:00.333 --> 01:11:02.125
- You didn't see
the look on her face. Mom.

1533
01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:04.583
- I know. I didn't. but

1534
01:11:06.083 --> 01:11:07.458
I've been AJ.

1535
01:11:07.458 --> 01:11:08.167
Okay.

1536
01:11:09.458 --> 01:11:12.042
I've been you. I've been Gabby.

1537
01:11:12.042 --> 01:11:13.042
You break hearts.

1538
01:11:13.042 --> 01:11:16.167
you get your heart broken.
and everything in between.

1539
01:11:16.167 --> 01:11:17.208
That's just how it works.

1540
01:11:17.208 --> 01:11:22.333
Be cool. And I think eventually
AJ will hear what you're saying.

1541
01:11:23.292 --> 01:11:24.875
- Having feelings is evil.

1542
01:11:25.167 --> 01:11:26.583
- It's the worst.

1543
01:11:27.708 --> 01:11:29.375
No feelings would be better.

1544
01:11:29.375 --> 01:11:31.417
but that's just not the way it is.

1545
01:11:32.125 --> 01:11:34.833
I do have one more
really important question though.

1546
01:11:34.833 --> 01:11:36.000
- What's up?

1547
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.083
- How does Coach Murray look?

1548
01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:40.417
- Oh.
- Like. seriously. level with me.

1549
01:11:40.417 --> 01:11:43.625
Tell me everything.
I want all the details.

1550
01:11:44.375 --> 01:11:46.458
What do you mean you think
only five people are gonna vote?

1551
01:11:47.417 --> 01:11:49.000
Hi. Gabby.

1552
01:11:50.417 --> 01:11:52.000
Huh. I'm telling you--

1553
01:12:29.167 --> 01:12:30.000
- Jesus.

1554
01:14:34.833 --> 01:14:36.250
Just drop it in your class box.

1555
01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:37.792
- Thank you.
Yep. you got it.

1556
01:14:48.542 --> 01:14:50.917
- I'm sorry. I just.
I really need to--

1557
01:14:50.917 --> 01:14:52.000
I know this is rude.

1558
01:14:52.625 --> 01:14:53.750
Um.

1559
01:14:56.542 --> 01:14:59.083
Sorry. I. I dropped something
up there.

1560
01:14:59.083 --> 01:15:00.500
so I have to go ahead of you.

1561
01:15:02.292 --> 01:15:03.583
Sorry. I'm gonna...

1562
01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:05.958
Hi.
- What are you doing?

1563
01:15:05.958 --> 01:15:08.042
- Are you just going
to ignore me forever?

1564
01:15:08.042 --> 01:15:09.292
- It's been three days.

1565
01:15:09.292 --> 01:15:12.167
- Well. each one of them
has felt like daylight savings.

1566
01:15:12.833 --> 01:15:14.500
- That would make them
an hour shorter.

1567
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:17.333
- Well. I told you. I don't know
the metric system.

1568
01:15:17.333 --> 01:15:19.292
- I know you were forced
to hang out with me on track.

1569
01:15:19.292 --> 01:15:20.875
but then you used me
to get to my sister.

1570
01:15:20.875 --> 01:15:23.542
to hide from Chantal.
and to figure out who KingPun was.

1571
01:15:23.542 --> 01:15:24.917
- Which you could have
told me about by the way.

1572
01:15:24.917 --> 01:15:26.167
- Oh. because you were
so honest?

1573
01:15:27.625 --> 01:15:28.792
- Okay. I deserved that.

1574
01:15:29.708 --> 01:15:31.292
It's not like you told
the truth though. either.

1575
01:15:31.292 --> 01:15:32.458
- Well. I wanted to tell you.

1576
01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:35.208
- You know. there are other places
you can go to make out. right?

1577
01:15:35.208 --> 01:15:36.792
- That's really not
what we're doing.

1578
01:15:37.625 --> 01:15:40.167
I wanted to tell you about KingPun.
that I was KingPun.

1579
01:15:40.958 --> 01:15:42.333
I wanted to tell you
how I felt.

1580
01:15:43.292 --> 01:15:44.750
how I think about you
all the time.

1581
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.667
How when you look at me.

1582
01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:49.083
I feel like my heart is
literally beating in my ears.

1583
01:15:49.083 --> 01:15:50.250
And when you get flustered.
I get flustered

1584
01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:52.458
'cause I think it's the stupidest.
cutest thing I've ever seen.

1585
01:15:52.458 --> 01:15:55.833
But maybe this is why
I didn't tell you.

1586
01:15:56.417 --> 01:15:58.167
because I knew it was
too good to be true.

1587
01:15:59.333 --> 01:16:01.708
You don't get to choose who you fall for.
Believe me. I get it.

1588
01:16:01.708 --> 01:16:04.250
- AJ. look at me.

1589
01:16:05.792 --> 01:16:06.667
I like you.

1590
01:16:07.792 --> 01:16:08.875
- I don't want to be runner-up.

1591
01:16:15.917 --> 01:16:17.500
Why does
the vote for Dillon hashtag

1592
01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.167
only have two posts.
and they're both from me?

1593
01:16:19.167 --> 01:16:21.167
- She hasn't posted
in 12 hours. is that weird?

1594
01:16:21.167 --> 01:16:22.208
That feels really weird.

1595
01:16:22.208 --> 01:16:23.875
- Uh. do you care
because it's KingPun.

1596
01:16:23.875 --> 01:16:25.750
or do you care because it's AJ
and it's driving you nuts

1597
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:26.875
not knowing what she's thinking?

1598
01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:28.917
- I'm not answering that.

1599
01:16:29.542 --> 01:16:32.208
Listen. I just know how much trouble
AJ will be in if I tell on her.

1600
01:16:32.208 --> 01:16:33.458
I don't know what to do.

1601
01:16:34.083 --> 01:16:35.375
- Fleeing is always an option.

1602
01:16:35.833 --> 01:16:37.667
- You're gonna be
a great president. Stacey.

1603
01:16:38.208 --> 01:16:39.250
- Thank you.

1604
01:16:40.083 --> 01:16:41.708
- Wait. you didn't vote for me?

1605
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:44.083
Here are me and AJ's uniforms.

1606
01:16:44.083 --> 01:16:45.875
- Thank you. Gabby.
Just put it in there.

1607
01:16:47.292 --> 01:16:49.875
- Hey. this had hot Cheetos dust
on it when I got it.

1608
01:16:49.875 --> 01:16:50.667
Really weird.

1609
01:16:53.708 --> 01:16:54.750
- Oh. Paige.

1610
01:16:55.292 --> 01:16:58.000
Principal Collins would like
to see you in her office.

1611
01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.083
- I know.

1612
01:16:59.083 --> 01:17:00.500
- And. um.

1613
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:05.417
tell your mom I said... hi.

1614
01:17:05.417 --> 01:17:06.417
- I will not.

1615
01:17:10.583 --> 01:17:12.958
Okay. let's just get this over with.

1616
01:17:14.333 --> 01:17:16.292
I'm KingPun.
There. I said it. okay.

1617
01:17:16.292 --> 01:17:18.667
I accept whatever consequences
you determine for me.

1618
01:17:18.667 --> 01:17:19.875
and I'll face them.

1619
01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:21.708
- Wait. let me get this straight.

1620
01:17:21.708 --> 01:17:23.250
You are also KingPun?

1621
01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:24.083
- Yes.

1622
01:17:24.083 --> 01:17:26.458
- Okay. I'm KingPun.
we're all KingPun.

1623
01:17:26.458 --> 01:17:27.750
In fact. I'm QueenPun.

1624
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:29.542
- Huh?
- Is it root vegetable season?

1625
01:17:29.542 --> 01:17:31.375
Because it's turn up time. see?

1626
01:17:31.375 --> 01:17:33.625
- No. I-I'm KingPun.

1627
01:17:33.625 --> 01:17:35.083
- We know you're not KingPun. okay.

1628
01:17:35.083 --> 01:17:36.583
AJ Campos came in
about an hour ago.

1629
01:17:36.583 --> 01:17:38.167
and she confessed to everything.
- Wait. what?

1630
01:17:38.167 --> 01:17:39.708
- Do you want to get suspended too?

1631
01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:42.625
I'm just curious. 'cause it feels like
you wanna get suspended.

1632
01:17:42.625 --> 01:17:44.708
And I don't know about you. but I'm
not trying to do double the paperwork.

1633
01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:45.792
I got things to do.

1634
01:17:45.792 --> 01:17:47.167
- Wait. suspension?

1635
01:17:47.167 --> 01:17:48.708
You. you suspended her?

1636
01:17:48.708 --> 01:17:50.375
- Yes. I suspended her.

1637
01:17:50.375 --> 01:17:52.333
She came in and gave me
all the evidence I needed.

1638
01:17:52.333 --> 01:17:54.375
and she's allowed back
into school next semester.

1639
01:17:54.375 --> 01:17:55.917
- Next semester?

1640
01:17:55.917 --> 01:17:57.958
- Do you understand
how space and time works?

1641
01:17:57.958 --> 01:18:00.208
Oh god.
this semester ends this week.

1642
01:18:00.583 --> 01:18:01.542
Why are you still here?

1643
01:18:01.542 --> 01:18:03.042
I have things to do.

1644
01:18:03.042 --> 01:18:04.917
wenches to boss

1645
01:18:04.917 --> 01:18:06.458
and turkey legs to motorboat

1646
01:18:06.792 --> 01:18:07.875
and history to write.

1647
01:18:07.875 --> 01:18:09.375
- Okay. I'll leave.

1648
01:18:09.375 --> 01:18:11.417
- Well. do you wanna help me
with the corset?

1649
01:18:11.417 --> 01:18:12.250
'Cause it's.

1650
01:18:13.208 --> 01:18:16.833
it is like a whole
panic room on my back.

1651
01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:32.208
- Like. I want to win. but I just.
like. I don't want to see you lose.

1652
01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.000
- I'm gonna win. babe.
- I don't know if you are.

1653
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:34.875
- I think I will.

1654
01:18:34.875 --> 01:18:35.625
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1655
01:18:35.625 --> 01:18:36.958
- You think you will win?
- I know I'm gonna win.

1656
01:18:36.958 --> 01:18:37.792
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1657
01:18:37.792 --> 01:18:39.375
- Tell me again.
- I'm gonna win.

1658
01:18:39.375 --> 01:18:40.458
- I'm gonna fucking win.

1659
01:18:41.458 --> 01:18:42.458
- I need your help.

1660
01:18:42.458 --> 01:18:43.542
Stacey. I need you
to call Gabby.

1661
01:18:43.917 --> 01:18:44.833
- Ugh.

1662
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:46.625
- Are you serious?

1663
01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:48.083
She's relapsing.

1664
01:18:48.083 --> 01:18:49.167
- It's the opposite actually.

1665
01:18:49.167 --> 01:18:50.375
I'll fill you guys in
while we work.

1666
01:18:50.375 --> 01:18:51.125
We should go.

1667
01:18:52.167 --> 01:18:53.333
Work on what?

1668
01:18:53.875 --> 01:18:55.125
Paige!
- Paige.

1669
01:19:11.458 --> 01:19:12.458
What are we doing?

1670
01:19:12.458 --> 01:19:13.583
You know I can't be here
right now.

1671
01:19:13.583 --> 01:19:14.708
This won't take long.

1672
01:19:16.417 --> 01:19:18.500
Jesus Christ!

1673
01:19:18.792 --> 01:19:19.792
What the hell are you doing?

1674
01:19:19.792 --> 01:19:20.792
Put that away!

1675
01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:24.667
Gabs. stop!

1676
01:19:26.542 --> 01:19:28.208
Are you just trying
to get me expelled at this point?

1677
01:19:28.917 --> 01:19:30.500
- Listen. I know you're still upset.

1678
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.875
- Yeah. more so now.

1679
01:19:31.875 --> 01:19:33.458
- But I will always have
your back. okay.

1680
01:19:33.458 --> 01:19:34.875
If you're going down.
I'm going down with you.

1681
01:19:34.875 --> 01:19:36.917
- Okay. yeah.
I appreciate the gesture.

1682
01:19:36.917 --> 01:19:38.333
but this is not gonna help me at all.

1683
01:19:38.333 --> 01:19:40.958
In fact. I think it's gonna get me
in more trouble.

1684
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.167
Also. what the hell is it?

1685
01:19:45.167 --> 01:19:46.333
- Isn't it obvious?

1686
01:19:46.333 --> 01:19:49.250
- No. I feel like I'm playing Pictionary
with an infant.

1687
01:19:49.917 --> 01:19:51.167
- It's supposed to be an arrow.

1688
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:52.875
You were supposed to follow it.

1689
01:19:53.417 --> 01:19:54.208
- What?

1690
01:19:54.667 --> 01:19:57.750
- Listen. I love you. okay.
even when we fight.

1691
01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:01.792
And you're a fucking incredible artist
and an amazing person.

1692
01:20:01.792 --> 01:20:03.333
You deserve to win. AJ.

1693
01:20:04.083 --> 01:20:05.708
- Alright. I do appreciate that.

1694
01:20:05.708 --> 01:20:07.875
- So please.
follow my shitty arrow.

1695
01:20:56.292 --> 01:20:58.000
Good afternoon. everybody.

1696
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.083
Uh. just a quick reminder.
there's about 50 spots open

1697
01:21:01.083 --> 01:21:02.833
for the Annual Renaissance Fair.

1698
01:21:02.833 --> 01:21:04.333
So if you'd like to sign up.

1699
01:21:04.333 --> 01:21:06.958
you could still do that in my office.

1700
01:21:06.958 --> 01:21:09.625
Moving on to the real reason
we're here today.

1701
01:21:09.625 --> 01:21:10.750
the election results.

1702
01:21:11.208 --> 01:21:14.375
And a quick thank you
to your peers here on stage

1703
01:21:14.375 --> 01:21:17.250
who have worked so hard
to earn your vote

1704
01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:20.250
to become the next
student body president.

1705
01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:22.917
And out of the two.
I have no idea who it could be.

1706
01:21:22.917 --> 01:21:24.875
It's such a close race

1707
01:21:25.958 --> 01:21:27.417
between the both of them.

1708
01:21:28.167 --> 01:21:29.458
Without further ado.

1709
01:21:29.792 --> 01:21:31.542
your next president is

1710
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.125
Stacey Clark!

1711
01:21:36.417 --> 01:21:37.833
- Madam President.

1712
01:21:37.833 --> 01:21:38.667
- First Gentleman.

1713
01:21:41.708 --> 01:21:43.042
- Go. Stacey!

1714
01:21:47.625 --> 01:21:51.750
- I am so honored to be
your new student body president.

1715
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:52.958
As many of you may know.

1716
01:21:52.958 --> 01:21:55.250
I've worked tirelessly
to make this dream happen.

1717
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:57.083
And I wanna give
a huge shout-out

1718
01:21:57.083 --> 01:21:58.542
to everybody who's helped me
along the way.

1719
01:21:59.292 --> 01:22:00.833
I'm looking at you. Todd and Henry.

1720
01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:02.875
Yeah!

1721
01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:04.458
- As promised on my campaign trail.

1722
01:22:04.458 --> 01:22:07.583
I will be completely transparent
about all my policies.

1723
01:22:07.958 --> 01:22:10.125
I also will be challenging
the administration

1724
01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:11.958
on any issues
I believe merit push back.

1725
01:22:12.375 --> 01:22:13.375
- Here we go.

1726
01:22:13.375 --> 01:22:16.042
- In fact. I'd like
to serve right now

1727
01:22:16.042 --> 01:22:19.500
by introducing you guys
to my very first project.

1728
01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.375
the beautification initiative.

1729
01:22:21.708 --> 01:22:24.208
It's about time we took a page
out of KingPun's book

1730
01:22:24.208 --> 01:22:27.708
and filled these school walls
with color and life.

1731
01:22:28.417 --> 01:22:31.708
It's time we reinvested in art.
no matter what the administration says.

1732
01:22:32.083 --> 01:22:33.417
- I voted for you. bitch.

1733
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.208
- Therefore.
to launch this initiative.

1734
01:22:36.208 --> 01:22:38.792
I'd like to welcome
a beautiful artist to the stage.

1735
01:22:39.458 --> 01:22:40.417
Paige Evans!

1736
01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:45.667
- Woo!

1737
01:22:45.667 --> 01:22:47.750
You look like a serial killer.
change your eyes.

1738
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:49.083
- What is she doing?

1739
01:22:49.083 --> 01:22:50.333
- Just wait.

1740
01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:53.208
- I can't believe I've become
an accomplice to this.

1741
01:22:54.083 --> 01:22:56.000
- You're gonna be surprised
by a lot of the things

1742
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.083
you do with me.

1743
01:22:57.958 --> 01:23:01.083
I'm mostly talking about sex stuff.
just so you know.

1744
01:23:03.667 --> 01:23:04.708
- Hello.

1745
01:23:06.375 --> 01:23:08.958
My name is Paige Evans.

1746
01:23:08.958 --> 01:23:10.625
- Yeah. yeah. Paige!

1747
01:23:14.083 --> 01:23:18.292
- Some of you guys may recognize me
from that party I attended once.

1748
01:23:19.792 --> 01:23:20.875
Jesus!

1749
01:23:20.875 --> 01:23:23.208
- This is terrible.

1750
01:23:24.375 --> 01:23:25.458
Good job.

1751
01:23:27.792 --> 01:23:29.542
- Like KingPun.

1752
01:23:29.542 --> 01:23:32.250
um. I too am also
an artist.

1753
01:23:33.958 --> 01:23:37.667
And I believe that art is supposed
to make you feel something.

1754
01:23:38.875 --> 01:23:41.542
KingPun isn't vandalizing
school property.

1755
01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:45.708
Actually breathing life
into this place.

1756
01:23:46.458 --> 01:23:50.667
Have you ever walked into school
and had a bad night

1757
01:23:50.667 --> 01:23:54.500
or had a breakup and saw a mural

1758
01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.708
and laughed or smiled?

1759
01:23:58.417 --> 01:24:01.708
Yes. So exactly.

1760
01:24:03.417 --> 01:24:07.375
I don't. I don't think that KingPun has
to be punished for that.

1761
01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:08.958
Yeah.

1762
01:24:08.958 --> 01:24:12.333
- And as your new
class president. I agree.

1763
01:24:12.333 --> 01:24:14.542
Yeah!

1764
01:24:14.542 --> 01:24:17.042
- Great. it's a coup.

1765
01:24:17.667 --> 01:24:18.875
- Go.
- What?

1766
01:24:18.875 --> 01:24:20.250
Please. please. please.

1767
01:24:22.417 --> 01:24:23.708
- Hi.

1768
01:24:24.083 --> 01:24:24.958
- Hi.

1769
01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:26.958
- So AJ is KingPun?

1770
01:24:28.208 --> 01:24:29.917
- I just need you to know
that when I'm with you.

1771
01:24:29.917 --> 01:24:31.375
it's not about Gabby.

1772
01:24:31.375 --> 01:24:32.708
it's. it's not about track.

1773
01:24:32.708 --> 01:24:34.083
- Paige. I don't really want--

1774
01:24:34.083 --> 01:24:37.083
- Just let me finish. okay.

1775
01:24:37.083 --> 01:24:38.208
Please.

1776
01:24:40.958 --> 01:24:41.875
- Yeah.

1777
01:24:42.292 --> 01:24:45.583
- I've been really struggling
with this stupid prompt.

1778
01:24:45.958 --> 01:24:48.833
trying to figure out what
my happiest moment feels like.

1779
01:24:48.833 --> 01:24:49.917
- Yo. I can't hear anything.

1780
01:24:49.917 --> 01:24:51.708
Hey. you guys know
what's happening?

1781
01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:55.208
- And I've realized that
it's not just one moment.

1782
01:24:55.667 --> 01:24:57.708
It's every moment
that I've had with you.

1783
01:24:57.708 --> 01:25:01.542
Falling for you has been
the happiest moment of my life.

1784
01:25:02.458 --> 01:25:05.875
And making this has been the easiest thing
I've made all semester.

1785
01:25:11.333 --> 01:25:12.708
- Oh my god.

1786
01:25:16.375 --> 01:25:17.292
- Wow.

1787
01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:19.083
- I mean.

1788
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:22.667
it really hasn't been the easiest thing.

1789
01:25:22.667 --> 01:25:25.333
I haven't slept in 24 hours.

1790
01:25:25.333 --> 01:25:27.333
but you get the idea.

1791
01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:31.958
- Can I talk now?

1792
01:25:31.958 --> 01:25:33.833
- Only if it's good.

1793
01:25:36.708 --> 01:25:39.208
- I'm really sorry
I threw you under the bus

1794
01:25:39.208 --> 01:25:40.333
and then let you take the fall for me.

1795
01:25:40.333 --> 01:25:42.458
It was wrong
and really messed up.

1796
01:25:42.875 --> 01:25:45.292
I just wanted to spend
every second I could with you.

1797
01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:50.833
And every stupid pun
and mural and drawing

1798
01:25:51.625 --> 01:25:52.958
brought us together.

1799
01:25:52.958 --> 01:25:55.125
So I couldn't stop

1800
01:25:55.958 --> 01:25:57.625
'cause I was falling for you too.

1801
01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:03.417
- Okay. that was good.

1802
01:26:04.042 --> 01:26:05.792
- Yo. can y'all speak up?
Man. we can't hear you.

1803
01:26:05.792 --> 01:26:06.417
- Speak up!

1804
01:26:06.417 --> 01:26:07.708
- Shut up. Tim!

1805
01:26:09.417 --> 01:26:10.500
Ahem. Sorry.

1806
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.208
- What do we do?

1807
01:26:12.583 --> 01:26:14.292
- I think if we kiss.
they'll get the idea.

1808
01:26:14.292 --> 01:26:15.000
- Okay.

1809
01:26:20.042 --> 01:26:21.000
- Oh. thank god.

1810
01:26:21.542 --> 01:26:22.917
- Yeah. sister!

1811
01:26:25.083 --> 01:26:26.458
- How are we gonna get that
to CalArts?

1812
01:26:26.458 --> 01:26:28.417
- Uh. my mom's got it covered.

1813
01:26:30.417 --> 01:26:32.458
- There's only
15 percent battery left.

1814
01:26:32.458 --> 01:26:33.833
- Oh yeah. I know.

1815
01:26:33.833 --> 01:26:35.583
I brought the charger
so that we can have a little fun

1816
01:26:35.583 --> 01:26:37.333
with this bad boy
in your office later on.

1817
01:26:37.333 --> 01:26:40.500
And by later on.
I mean in. like. 90 seconds.

1818
01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:41.583
We should go.

1819
01:26:44.667 --> 01:26:45.792
- Thank god this went well.

1820
01:26:46.625 --> 01:26:49.083
Could you imagine if she got you
turning me down on tape?

1821
01:26:50.125 --> 01:26:52.250
- Hello?
- Oh yep. there you are.

1822
01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:53.667
- I was sitting here
the whole time.

1823
01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:54.542
Did you not notice?
- No.

1824
01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:56.542
Why are you smiling?

1825
01:26:56.542 --> 01:26:57.542
- What are you talking about?

1826
01:26:57.542 --> 01:26:59.333
- I know you took some of my hair.

1827
01:26:59.333 --> 01:27:01.000
- I know that you're in love with me.

1828
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.792
- Whoa. okay. don't flatter yourself.
You're not my type.

1829
01:27:03.792 --> 01:27:05.292
Two. of course I took your hair.

1830
01:27:05.292 --> 01:27:07.000
How else is a love spell
supposed to work?

1831
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.625
I'm exhausted.

1832
01:27:09.375 --> 01:27:10.167
You're welcome.

1833
01:27:11.917 --> 01:27:13.375
- She really just called us out.

1834
01:27:13.375 --> 01:27:14.375
Paige!

1835
01:27:16.208 --> 01:27:19.792
- Okay. I know. I know.
Double the paperwork and I'm sorry.

1836
01:27:19.792 --> 01:27:22.625
And you're gonna have
to suspend us both. so--

1837
01:27:22.625 --> 01:27:24.375
- I'm not suspending
either one of you guys.

1838
01:27:24.375 --> 01:27:25.708
- Really?
- What?

1839
01:27:25.708 --> 01:27:28.000
- Did I stutter?
You guys need to clean your ears.

1840
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.208
No. not suspending anyone.

1841
01:27:30.208 --> 01:27:31.917
And the beautification initiative.

1842
01:27:31.917 --> 01:27:34.042
when the board hears about it.
it was me.

1843
01:27:34.042 --> 01:27:36.125
- Okay. that's fine.
- Damn.

1844
01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:37.167
- Oh. I'm not done yet.

1845
01:27:37.583 --> 01:27:39.500
You guys are also gonna run
the face painting booth

1846
01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:41.083
at the RenFaire this year.

1847
01:27:41.083 --> 01:27:42.167
- Anything but that.

1848
01:27:42.167 --> 01:27:43.833
- That's the face I was looking for!

1849
01:27:43.833 --> 01:27:45.625
Looking like a bunch of wenches.

1850
01:27:46.583 --> 01:27:47.833
- She just called us wenches.

1851
01:27:47.833 --> 01:27:49.042
- Does this mean I have to paint Tim?

1852
01:27:49.042 --> 01:27:50.792
- I think honestly.
we should be thanking her.

1853
01:27:51.208 --> 01:27:52.875
- It's the first day on the job.

1854
01:27:52.875 --> 01:27:54.542
and you already started
a revolution.

1855
01:27:54.542 --> 01:27:55.958
- Would you expect anything less?

1856
01:27:55.958 --> 01:27:57.417
- Time to use those dental dams.

1857
01:27:57.417 --> 01:27:58.833
There's some in your locker.

1858
01:28:00.167 --> 01:28:01.042
- Thank you.

1859
01:28:03.292 --> 01:28:06.250
By the way.
that wasn't just a kiss.

1860
01:28:07.625 --> 01:28:08.792
- Yeah. no shit.

1861
01:28:10.833 --> 01:28:13.167
The thing about art
is that you can't force it.

1862
01:28:13.583 --> 01:28:14.792
It's a lot like love.

1863
01:28:15.292 --> 01:28:16.667
You should just let it
come to you

1864
01:28:16.667 --> 01:28:18.667
and not be afraid
to be vulnerable.

1865
01:28:19.542 --> 01:28:22.417
I spent so long
comparing myself to other artists.

1866
01:28:22.417 --> 01:28:24.250
to my peers. to KingPun.

1867
01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:27.583
When I finally stopped
and I started living my life.

1868
01:28:27.583 --> 01:28:28.792
my art caught up with me.

1869
01:28:29.417 --> 01:28:30.792
And you know what?

1870
01:28:30.792 --> 01:28:32.875
It looks pretty damn good from here.
