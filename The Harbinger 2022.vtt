without the light.

of the same circle.

and influences people
to commit suicide.

511
00:32:12.237 --> 00:32:14.699
The Harbinger's job
is to drop the relic

512
00:32:14.734 --> 00:32:16.833

of the victims.

513
00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:19.770

kill the people?

-He can. but just because
he kills them

515
00:32:22.082 --> 00:32:23.807
doesn't mean he gets them.

516
00:32:23.842 --> 00:32:28.317
Your only way to true damnation
is through suicide.

517
00:32:28.352 --> 00:32:31.815

to get you there.

518

the relic himself?

519

-To cover more ground.

520
00:32:38.659 --> 00:32:40.890

to each town.

521

522
00:32:42.432 --> 00:32:44.366

going to jail.

on one condition --

1070

01:10:31.963 --> 01:10:33.402
I couldn't bring myself
to do it.

1079
01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:36.097
even if it meant
avoiding poverty and prison.

1080
01:10:36.132 --> 01:10:38.264
When he realized this.

1081
01:10:38.299 --> 01:10:42.103
he took my daughter's spirit
until the job is done.

1082
01:10:44.008 --> 01:10:46.514
-Your daughter's spirit?

1083
01:10:46.549 --> 01:10:49.451
-What if I were to tell you
Santa Claus is real?

1084
01:10:53.985 --> 01:10:58.086
You -- Wh-- You're telling me
there's a Harbinger?

1085
01:10:58.121 --> 01:11:00.660
-I'll tell you everything if
you are willing to hear me out.

1086
01:11:00.695 --> 01:11:03.190
-Answer first. You're saying
there<i> is</i> a Harbinger.

1087
01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:04.763
-I need to know
you're gonna hear me out.

1088
01:11:04.798 --> 01:11:06.996
-You first. or I'm walking
through that door.

1089
01:11:07.031 --> 01:11:08.701
You're saying
there's a Harbinger.

1090
01:11:08.736 --> 01:11:11.671
-No. John. I'm telling you
<i>I'm</i> The Harbinger.

1091
01:11:11.706 --> 01:11:13.167
But I want out.

1092
01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.872
<i>-My mother would never</i>
<i>commit suicide.</i>

1093
01:11:14.907 --> 01:11:17.303
<i>She's Catholic.</i>
<i>-Can you think of any enemies</i>

1094
01:11:17.338 --> 01:11:18.975
<i>you may have made?</i>
<i>-Found that in Betty's car.</i>

1095
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:20.878
<i>-Stabbed in the eyes</i>
<i>with a letter opener.</i>

1096
01:11:20.913 --> 01:11:22.946
-I came here to do these things.

1097
01:11:22.981 --> 01:11:24.684
I couldn't bring myself
to do them.

1098
01:11:24.719 --> 01:11:28.017

someone<i> else</i> is doing it.

1099
01:11:28.052 --> 01:11:29.689

and not your wife?

01:11:33.926 --> 01:11:35.530

about all this?

1102
01:11:35.565 --> 01:11:37.466
-She's part of it.
My family needs your help. John.

1103
01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:39.798
I figured<i> you</i> of all people
would believe me.

1104
01:11:39.833 --> 01:11:42.867
You know the story.
You have the relics!

1105
01:11:42.902 --> 01:11:44.506
-But they're replicas.

1106
01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:46.673
They came with little --
uh. little booklets.

1107
01:11:46.708 --> 01:11:49.203
I got 'em for a dollar each
at a yard sale.

1108
01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:51.909
I-If you told me this when
you weren't in trouble.

you were batshit crazy.

And here we go.

1153
01:14:50.353 --> 01:14:56.027
In 1647. the first white
fur traders arrived here.

1154
01:14:56.062 --> 01:14:58.667
The settlers were not
far behind.

1155
01:14:58.702 --> 01:15:00.834
They did not understand
our ways.

1156
01:15:00.869 --> 01:15:04.497
and we certainly
did not understand theirs.

1157
01:15:04.532 --> 01:15:07.940
Along with them came
their illnesses. mythology.

1158
01:15:07.975 --> 01:15:11.108
their deity. and. of course.

1159
01:15:11.143 --> 01:15:13.209
their anti-deity.

1160
01:15:15.653 --> 01:15:18.687
But Luc. or Lucifer
as he was called then.

1161
01:15:18.722 --> 01:15:20.788
was new to this world as well.

1162
01:15:23.628 --> 01:15:25.793
He didn't understand
that some land

1163
01:15:25.828 --> 01:15:29.456
was our sacred burial ground.

1164
01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:32.030
He had to learn the hard way.

1165
01:15:32.065 --> 01:15:35.132
Because he knew he had no power
on our domain...

1166
01:15:35.167 --> 01:15:38.102
-...over time he made a promise

1167
01:15:38.137 --> 01:15:41.875
to leave our people alone.

1168
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:45.373
and he guaranteed it
with an official treaty ceremony

1169
01:15:45.408 --> 01:15:48.079
taking place with him
on his land.

1170
01:15:48.114 --> 01:15:50.950
and our people on ours.

1171
01:15:50.985 --> 01:15:53.821
But naturally.
he broke his promise.

1172
01:15:53.856 --> 01:15:56.252
Whenever one of us
ventured off our land.

1173
01:15:56.287 --> 01:15:59.794
he took advantage.

1174
01:15:59.829 --> 01:16:04.997
Through the years. Luc learned
where he had power.

1175
01:16:05.032 --> 01:16:07.395
where he did not.

1176
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:11.168
Our people cursed him.
along with his followers

1177
01:16:11.203 --> 01:16:13.742
and those who disturbed
our grounds.

1178
01:16:13.777 --> 01:16:18.109
From then on. Luc dared not
cross the boundary.

1179
01:16:18.144 --> 01:16:21.178
Although<i> he</i> learned
the lay of the land.

1180
01:16:21.213 --> 01:16:23.917
the settlers did not.

1181
01:16:23.952 --> 01:16:28.119
Time and time again.
and across generations.

1182
01:16:28.154 --> 01:16:31.287
they buried their dead
on sacred ground.

1183
01:16:31.322 --> 01:16:35.522
These souls could not be claimed
by Luc<i> or</i> God.

1184
01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:37.964
Your people are right.

1185
01:16:37.999 --> 01:16:40.197
They<i> are</i> cursed.

1186
01:16:40.232 --> 01:16:42.771
Luc had quite
the silver tongue.

1187
01:16:42.806 --> 01:16:45.807
He promised that
if they collected enough souls.

1188
01:16:45.842 --> 01:16:48.139
he would lift the curse.

1189
01:16:48.174 --> 01:16:51.604
But no matter how many souls
The Harbingers collect.

1190
01:16:51.639 --> 01:16:55.311
it is never enough.

1191
01:16:55.346 --> 01:16:57.016
He tricked 'em.

1192
01:16:57.051 --> 01:16:59.612
And that does not bode well
for you.

1193
01:16:59.647 --> 01:17:02.054
my poor. poor. dear boy.

1194
01:17:05.257 --> 01:17:07.059
Give it to me.

1195
01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:13.461
This is the dagger
made by your God.

1196
01:17:13.496 --> 01:17:16.706
To resurrect her.
you must plunge the dagger

1197
01:17:16.741 --> 01:17:18.741
deep into her chest.

1198
01:17:18.776 --> 01:17:22.976
The evil will pour from her.
expelling the dagger.

1199
01:17:23.011 --> 01:17:25.407
Once her body and soul
are restored.

1200
01:17:25.442 --> 01:17:28.982
your contract with Luc
is null and void.

1201
01:17:29.017 --> 01:17:31.083
Rosalie will never go willingly.

1202
01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:36.154
Spike her drink with this.

1203
01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:39.421
It will put her in a trance long
enough for you to get her in.

1204
01:17:39.456 --> 01:17:41.555
-I have something for you.

1205
01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:47.330
-Where did you get this?

1206
01:17:47.365 --> 01:17:51.103
This has been missing
from our people for generations.

1207
01:17:51.138 --> 01:17:52.368
centuries.

1208
01:17:52.403 --> 01:17:54.436
-Valuable enough to lift
the curse?

1209
01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:56.944
-Daniel.
That is not for me to say.

1210
01:17:56.979 --> 01:17:59.441
It is beyond my realm
of knowledge.

1211
01:17:59.476 --> 01:18:01.377
Those curses come from
the spirits.

1212
01:18:01.412 --> 01:18:05.711
but dare I say it couldn't hurt.

1213
01:18:05.746 --> 01:18:09.187
I must give you something
in return of no less value.

1214
01:18:09.222 --> 01:18:10.793
But I have nothing.

1215
01:18:10.828 --> 01:18:12.322
-Yes. you do.

1216
01:18:14.832 --> 01:18:16.766

Native American land.

1217
01:18:16.801 --> 01:18:18.394
the left half non-Native.

1218
01:18:18.429 --> 01:18:19.725
Crypt is dead center.

1219
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.199

they built that

1220
01:18:21.234 --> 01:18:23.267

was on sacred ground. too.

1222

1228
01:18:38.614 --> 01:18:41.549

an above-ground entrance.

1233
01:18:50.428 --> 01:18:51.900
We're not going

1234

01:18:58.469 --> 01:19:00.469
But if you must. go in daylight.

1238
01:19:00.504 --> 01:19:04.110

Otherwise. head for the tunnels.

1240

This pipe-shaped one --
it's called a Helix.

1241
01:19:10.382 --> 01:19:12.283
and it will keep the spirits
at bay for a bit.

1242
01:19:12.318 --> 01:19:13.856
but you don't have long.

1243
01:19:13.891 --> 01:19:15.748

1244
01:19:15.783 --> 01:19:18.520

1247
01:19:22.493 --> 01:19:25.428
If one of his cronies
gets a hold of...

1248
01:19:25.463 --> 01:19:28.497
the globe -- this one --
