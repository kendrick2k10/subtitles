00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:07.466
‐ That way he's standing.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:09.134
I mean. it looks like
it's higher. right?

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:12.221
Because you do that
from the second rope.

7
00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:13.514
Boom!

8
00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.769
<i>This job to me is the greatest
life that I could ever live.</i>

9
00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:22.314
For years people told me
I was too small.

10
00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.274
that I couldn't do this
and I couldn't do that

11
00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:26.151
and I wasn't going to make it.

12
00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.487
And I've shoved it
in everybody's face.

13
00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:29.821
No time‐outs in this. man.

14
00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:34.576
<i>I realize I can't be popular
with everybody all the time.</i>

15
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:38.163
So in the meantime. I'm going
to be popular with me.

16
00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:39.706
and I'm going to be the best.

17
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:43.460
<i>‐ There are definitely
two lives of Shawn Michaels.</i>

18
00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:46.171
You know.
there's who he was before...

19
00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.715
<i>‐ You will not ever
in your lives</i>

20
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.385
<i>see a man more charismatic.</i>

21
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.513
<i>more flamboyant.
or more talented</i>

22
00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:57.224
<i>than the Heartbreak Kid
Shawn Michaels.</i>

23
00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:03.397
‐ The greatest in‐ring
performer of all time.

24
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.816
<i>Being a prick
comes natural to Shawn.</i>

25
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.568
It did.
He was a dick.

26
00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:11.321
‐ <i>The showstopper.
the headliner. the main event.</i>

27
00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.323
<i>‐ There was so much
bad blood between us.</i>

28
00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:17.369
and I was always like.
"If I see him. I'll kill him."

29
00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:20.163
<i>I had so much anger about it.</i>

30
00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:24.418
‐ Nobody steals my spotlight.
I want it all.

31
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.378
‐ Shawn Michaels
could do absolutely anything.

32
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.131
any style to perfection
with anyone.

33
00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:32.134
<i>When the bell rings.
no one is as good as Shawn.</i>

34
00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.094
‐ <i>I will give you a show</i>

35
00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:36.847
<i>like you have never ever
seen before.</i>

36
00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:40.142
Why?
Because I can.

37
00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:43.520
‐ <i>The only man
to win every major title.</i>

38
00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:46.898
‐ You can't say anybody
was better. but also tormented.

39
00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:48.525
<i>He was. like.
on self‐destruct mode.</i>

40
00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:51.153
‐ <i>I just knew
that he didn't love himself.</i>

41
00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.946
There was something
in him that he despised.

42
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.991
<i>‐ If you're taking pain pills

<i>everything that
you have in your life is this.</i>

45
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.874
<i>And it's all going away.</i>

46
00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.251
<i>‐ On more than one occasion.</i>

47
00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.128
I really wanted to beat
the hell out of Shawn.

48
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.297
<i>but I knew there was
a good man</i>

49
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.341
<i>behind all this other crap.</i>

50
00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:14.384
<i>‐ The biggest thing
that he ever did</i>

51
00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:15.719
is turning
his life around

52
00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:18.180
to where he is now.

53
00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:21.266
‐ <i>And so. yep.
there are two lives there.</i>

54
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.685
But there's one Shawn Michaels.

55
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.815
‐ <i>The very best sports
entertainer in the world.</i>

<i>[rock music plays]</i>

57
00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:35.572

‐ I love it. I say this.
I say we‐‐again‐‐

59
00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:39.951
Vince used to always tell me
"You go all the way out there.

60
00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:41.161
I'll reel you back in
if I want to."

61
00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:42.788
you know what I mean?

62
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.416
<i>‐ NXT started out
as a developmental brand</i>

63
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.460
<i>that grooms WWE superstars.</i>

64
00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:51.755
‐ Any kind of count up. DQ.
or whatever ends the match.

65
00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:56.093
‐ There's Shawn's fingerprints
in almost every talent in NXT.

66
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.302
Shawn is very hands on.

67
00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:59.805
‐ Then he sits up behind him
and then whack!

68
00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.557
‐ <i>He sold out arenas
all around the world</i>

69
00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.434
<i>when he was
the Heartbreak Kid.</i>

70
00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:05.769
He's in a different place
in his life now.

71
00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.772
He's humble. he wants
to be behind the scenes.

72
00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.315
<i>It isn't about him.</i>

73
00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.651
<i>He wants to help others
achieve their dreams.</i>

74
00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:15.153
You've got to say it
with passion and anger.

75
00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:18.365
‐ <i>Here we go. guys.
three. two. one.</i>

76
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.741
‐ <i>Seeing Shawn today.</i>

77
00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.829
it's sometimes hard
for people to believe

78
00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:25.831
that's Shawn Michaels.

79
00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:27.374
<i>Certain levels of talent</i>

80
00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:28.959
<i>command certain levels
of respect.</i>

81
00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.670
<i>‐ Just attack

82
00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.130
‐ Oh. jeez.

83
00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.631
‐ I added the plexiglass.

84
00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:38.343
‐ <i>His knowledge
and his wisdom of the business</i>

85
00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.304
and all that stuff.
it's so valuable.

86
00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.056
So excellent job.
Yeah. go. you got this.

87
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.642
‐ <i>Shawn Michaels' life
is a story</i>

88
00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:47.686
<i>that a lot of people
could relate to.</i>

89
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.980
<i>He always wanted more.</i>

90
00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.274
It was a life of never enough.

91
00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:55.569
And then.
his life totally changes.

92
00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:58.488
<i>A lot of us have that.
if we're lucky.</i>

93
00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:01.158
I think the Shawn Michaels
story is one that's really cool

94
00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:04.327
and one that all of us
can stand to learn from.

95
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:08.248
<i>[twangy guitar]</i>

96
00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:11.126
‐ <i>I was born
into a military family.</i>

97
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:14.087
<i>My father was
in the Air Force.</i>

98
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:15.422
It was
Michael Shawn Hickenbottom.

99
00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.508
but everybody in my family
called me Shawn.

100
00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:23.346
<i>My father was a pilot.
so early on we moved a lot.</i>

101
00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.265
<i>He was going to Vietnam.</i>

102
00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.476
<i>We went to England.
then Maryland</i>

103
00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.853
and then we moved to Texas.

104
00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.646
<i>I was about eight‐ish.</i>

105
00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:35.942
<i>From that point on.
I was in the state of Texas.</i>

106
00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:39.863
<i>You don't have long‐lasting
friendships in the Air Force.</i>

107
00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.240
<i>The hardest part
for making friends</i>

108
00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:43.533
was having the last name.

109
00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.536
The roll call. Hickenbottom.
Michael Hickenbottom.

110
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.163
You could hear the snickers
all over the room.

111
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.540
Hickenbottom. And. of course...

112
00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:51.625
It's like. "Son of a biscuit.

113
00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:53.794
I wish I had
a different last name."

114
00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:56.630
‐ <i>Shawn was well‐loved.</i>

115
00:04:56.713 --> 00:05:01.468
He was always very quiet
and very shy growing up.

116
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.428
He wasn't an extrovert.

117
00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:09.059
t a good. friendly.
nice little boy.

118
00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:10.602
<i>And people liked him.</i>

119
00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.313
<i>He was involved in sports
all of his life.</i>

120
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:17.442
<i>He just enjoyed
doing everything.</i>

121
00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:20.195
‐ <i>I was a big fan
of playing football.</i>

122
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.696
<i>because of the contact.</i>

123
00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:26.618
You know. contact and athletics
were appealing to me.

124
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.745
<i>And then I'm 12 years old.</i>

125
00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:32.165
getting to stay up late
on a Saturday night.

126
00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.709
<i>and this wrestling show
starts.</i>

127
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.170
<i>Southwest
Championship Wrestling.</i>

128
00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.755
<i>The beginning montage.</i>

129
00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:42.008
<i>the guy is slow motion
jumping off the top rope.</i>

130
00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.844
I was enthralled in it.
It was just‐‐[laughs]

131
00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:45.971
I don't know.
the neatest thing I ever saw.

132
00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:48.056
‐ The best in professional
wrestling and I'm‐‐

133
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.391
<i>‐ After the show.
I walked out</i>

134
00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:50.725
<i>and my mom was in the kitchen.</i>

135
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:52.978
I said. "I know what I'm
going to do when I grow up."

136
00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:54.479
And she said. "What's that?"

137
00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:55.939
I said. "I'm going to be
a professional wrestler."

138
00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.191
She was like.
"Oh. that's nice. honey."

139
00:05:58.275 --> 00:06:02.487
‐ <i>He began to talk about
that's what he wanted to do.</i>

140
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:06.449
<i>and I was sure that ultimately
he would grow out of that.</i>

141
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.368
but he never did.

142
00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.328
‐ <i>Down at the Freeman Coliseum.</i>

143
00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:12.414
Shawn would periodically
get to go.

144
00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.000
and. oh.
he saw Tully Blanchard.

145
00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:18.795
‐ <i>Wahoo McDaniel.
Eddie Mansfield. Scott Casey.</i>

146
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.425
‐ <i>Of course. then later.
Ric Flair was a wrestling god.</i>

147
00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.594
<i>and he would buy
wrestling magazines.</i>

148
00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:27.554
<i>and he would look
at Ric Flair.</i>

149
00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:28.805
<i>and then he would
stand in the mirror.</i>

150
00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:32.309
and try to talk like him
and look like him.

151
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.768
‐ <i>Being a wrestling fan.</i>

152
00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:37.188
<i>it was really a black sheep
source of mockery.</i>

153
00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:41.276
It's not something you say
with a great deal of pride.

154
00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:42.777
<i>It was just a relationship</i>

155
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.363
between me and wrestling
for a while

156
00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.157
and my dad
was an amateur wrestler

157
00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:51.161
at the University of Iowa.
so he was a real wrestler.

158
00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:54.456
And. of course. he just gave
some gruff like. "That's fake."

159
00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.000
The kindest thing
I could say about it was

160
00:06:57.125 --> 00:07:01.421
I considered it to be
an athletic soap opera.

161
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.590
which has always been
my description

162
00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.383
of professional wrestling.

163
00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.302
‐ <i>Then a new kid
gets transferred.</i>

164
00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.304
<i>His name is Kenny Kent.</i>

165
00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:12.599
I met Shawn the summer of 1980.

166
00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:14.684
We were sophomores
in high school. Both 15.

167
00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:17.520
<i>He would want to wrestle
and throw around his friends.</i>

168
00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:18.855
<i>and they didn't like it.</i>

169
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.359
And so I instantly became

462
00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:25.915
but the wrestling business

463
00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.208
is one giant
fish story. all right?

464
00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:29.293
So something happened once

to ten times.

threw a beer bottle.</i>

468
00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:41.222

<i>tearing up the bar. throwing

‐ <i>The next day.
Shawn and Marty were fired.</i>

474
00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.906
and it was over for them
after one day.

475
00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:03.828
from just the story
and the hearsay and innuendo.

476

<i>‐ I normally
give reasons as to. you know.</i>

478
00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:12.461
but that was one and done. out.

In my mind.
I'm 23 and it's over.

482
00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:26.142
That was my one big shot.

483
00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:29.311

a little longer?

This was a tremendous bout.

503
00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:13.814
‐ <i>I mean. someone
like Shawn Michaels</i>

504
00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:16.484
gives that to you. that's all
the motivation that you need.

505
00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:20.780
[laughter]

506
00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:25.159
[crowd cheering]

507
00:21:25.242 --> 00:21:27.495
‐ <i>The unfortunate byproduct</i>

508
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:33.542
<i>of Shawn and Marty being fired
after their first day in WWE</i>

509
00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:37.171
is Marty and Shawn had burned
their bridge in the AWA.

510
00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.422
Where do you go?

511
00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:39.840
<i>And welcome once again</i>

512
00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.467
<i>to Continental Championship
Wrestling and we have‐‐</i>

513
00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:44.762
‐ We ended up
in Birmingham. Alabama.

514
00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:46.555
Continental Wrestling.

515
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.766
<i>I was wrestling
in front of 25 people</i>

516
00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:50.351
<i>at 300 bucks a week.</i>

517
00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:52.812
If you wanted to get $50
in cash.

518
00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:55.439
you get your other $50 in blow.
you could do that.

519
00:21:55.523 --> 00:22:00.194
Which is probably what I did
nine times out of ten.

520
00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:03.614
‐ <i>I heard him talk about
how depressed he was.</i>

521
00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:06.492
<i>At that time. we was
doing a lot of cocaine.</i>

522
00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:07.868
<i>And we would talk
about wrestling</i>

523
00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:11.163
<i>and we would watch wrestling
videos and we would study.</i>

524
00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:12.665
<i>I had to go home
to my girlfriend</i>

525
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.583
<i>like at two or three
or four in the morning.</i>

526
00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:17.211
<i>Sometimes the next
morning sun was out.</i>

527
00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:19.672
<i>And evidently.
the way he says it.</i>

528
00:22:19.797 --> 00:22:22.258
I let him down 'cause
I didn't stay with him more

529
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:23.801
and he was by himself.

530
00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:25.761
When you're doing cocaine.
you don't want to be alone.

531
00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:28.639
[laughs]

532
00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:30.850
‐ When you're up
at 4:00 in the morning

533
00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:36.438
<i>coming down from the yayo.
that's like. it's very dreary.</i>

534
00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:39.650
<i>Because the low
is just so really low.</i>

535
00:22:39.775 --> 00:22:41.527
<i>I was like.
"Man. if I had a gun.</i>

536
00:22:41.652 --> 00:22:42.820
<i>"this is one
of those times</i>

537
00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:45.823
that I was reckless enough
to have the balls to do it."

538
00:22:45.906 --> 00:22:48.075
<i>At that time. it would
have wrecked my parents.</i>

539
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:53.497
<i>You know. their suffering is
what pulled me back from that.</i>

540
00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:56.083
But the thing is
I never told them the truth.

541
00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:58.252
So I'm not telling like.
"Jeez. Mama. I'm just partying.

542
00:22:58.335 --> 00:23:00.963
getting hammered
and doing blow."

543
00:23:01.005 --> 00:23:04.925
‐ <i>Shawn and Marty.
they wanted to come back.</i>

544
00:23:05.009 --> 00:23:08.012
I remember Pat Patterson giving
them the advice

545
00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:09.555
to continue to work

546
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:15.019
<i>and continue to reverse
the reputation that you have.</i>

547
00:23:15.144 --> 00:23:17.313
and prove to us
that you belong.

548
00:23:17.438 --> 00:23:19.481
And that's what
Marty and Shawn did.

549
00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:21.191
‐ Pat was instrumental
in saying.

550
00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:22.985
"Vince. he's a great talent."

551
00:23:23.027 --> 00:23:25.279
<i>and it is difficult for me
to make that decision.</i>

552
00:23:25.362 --> 00:23:26.697
<i>because he was a jerk.</i>

553
00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:28.324
<i>I mean. doing
some stupid things.</i>

554
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:30.326
But Pat was right.

555
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:32.995
‐ <i>I was there in '88
when they came back.</i>

556
00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:34.246
<i>It had been a year</i>

557
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.583
since the Rockers had kinda
screwed up on their first day.

558
00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:40.294
‐ <i>We're gonna bring you back.
but you're on probation.</i>

559
00:23:40.377 --> 00:23:42.004
You know.
keep your [bleep] together.

560
00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:45.007
Yes. sir.

561
00:23:45.132 --> 00:23:46.467
‐ <i>Two newcomers. the Rockers.</i>

562
00:23:46.592 --> 00:23:48.427
<i>These guys are excitement
personified.</i>

563
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.554
<i>They'll be high flying.</i>

564
00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:52.806
<i>‐ I met Shawn in 1990.</i>

565
00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.768
<i>They were pretty much.
you know. fun loving guys.</i>

566
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:57.311
They even tested me
a little bit with their.

567
00:23:57.394 --> 00:23:59.229
you know. their antics.

568
00:23:59.355 --> 00:24:02.483
Actually. you know. they were
both pretty much peckerheads.

569
00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:04.902
I mean. I've got to call
a spade a spade.

570
00:24:05.027 --> 00:24:06.487
‐ <i>The Rockers
have got a bag full of tricks</i>

571
00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:07.821
<i>and you ain't
seen nothing yet.</i>

572
00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:09.615
so get ready.
because here we come.

573
00:24:09.698 --> 00:24:11.200
Wow!

574
00:24:11.325 --> 00:24:13.744
<i>‐ They were definitely
innovators</i>

575
00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:16.246
<i>doing tandem moves together.</i>

576
00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.999
You know. such a cohesive unit.

577
00:24:19.083 --> 00:24:22.544
The fans went nuts for them.
especially the women.

578
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:26.215
<i>You know.
the long hair and all that.</i>

579
00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:27.216
‐ <i>There was a transitional
moment</i>

580
00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:29.468
<i>happening in the business</i>

581
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.012
<i>where the athleticism
was picking up.</i>

582
00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:36.350
The ability to do things that
Shawn and Marty could do.

583
00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:38.060
‐ <i>Oh. what a backdrop!</i>

584
00:24:38.185 --> 00:24:40.145
‐ <i>Tag team wrestling now</i>

585
00:24:40.229 --> 00:24:43.273
has been impacted a great deal
by what Marty and I did.

586
00:24:43.357 --> 00:24:44.817
[camera shutter clicking]

587
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.695
‐ <i>The first time you ever
make a magazine is huge.</i>

588
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.239
and we would always go
to the stores.

589
00:24:50.364 --> 00:24:51.699
stop and look
at the magazine racks.

590
00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:54.827
I remember one time
I heard Shawn "Oh. my God!"

591
00:24:54.868 --> 00:24:55.995
<i>And there was a picture of us.</i>

592
00:24:56.078 --> 00:24:59.540
<i>It said
"From Imitators To Innovators"</i>

593
00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:01.542
<i>and he's holding it up
and he was so proud</i>

594
00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:05.129
and I was. like. "Oh. man!
Yeah. we did it!

595
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.213
‐ <i>Shawn Michaels.</i>

596
00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:09.258
<i>Marty Jannetty. the Rockers.</i>

597
00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:11.218
‐ <i>That's a real
notch in the belt.</i>

598
00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:13.470
to be on Saturday night's
main event.

599
00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:14.722
‐ <i>Saturday night's
main event</i>

600
00:25:14.847 --> 00:25:16.932
<i>was finally going
to be the Rockers</i>

601
00:25:17.016 --> 00:25:19.476
winning
the Tag Team Championship

602
00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:22.688
against Bret Hart
and Jim the Anvil Neidhart.

603
00:25:22.813 --> 00:25:24.982
‐ It was gonna be five stars.

604
00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:27.234
It was gonna be as good
a match as we ever had.

605
00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.986
[crowd cheering]

606
00:25:29.028 --> 00:25:31.822
‐ <i>We're in the process
of having that match.</i>

607
00:25:31.905 --> 00:25:35.617
and all of a sudden.
the rope breaks.

608
00:25:35.701 --> 00:25:37.494
<i>Bret. the consummate pro.</i>

609
00:25:37.578 --> 00:25:40.039
<i>he understands it's not live.
it's taped.</i>

610
00:25:40.122 --> 00:25:41.540
<i>We can fix all this.</i>

611
00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:42.916
‐ It's taped.
All you've got to do

612
00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:45.002
<i>is grab a hold
and then they'll fix it</i>

613
00:25:45.127 --> 00:25:46.670
<i>and then you're still
in that hold.</i>

614
00:25:46.754 --> 00:25:48.047
<i>then the match can carry on.</i>

615
00:25:48.172 --> 00:25:50.841
And I told them.
I said. "Just fix the rope."

616
00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:52.926
"Fix the rope. fix the rope.
We'll take care of this."

617
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.764
<i>And then we get word.
just to continue without it.</i>

618
00:25:56.847 --> 00:25:59.141
so that's what we do.

619
00:25:59.266 --> 00:26:03.729
‐ It was a disaster.
and I was so sick about it.

620
00:26:03.812 --> 00:26:05.439
‐ <i>We get our
championship victory.</i>

621
00:26:05.522 --> 00:26:08.192
<i>We are doing our best
to look excited</i>

622
00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:14.656
<i>in what is this huge steaming
pile of crap in the ring.</i>

623
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.241
‐ <i>It just looked horrible.</i>

624
00:26:16.366 --> 00:26:18.285
So the match never aired.

625
00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:19.828
‐ <i>Vince calls me and said.</i>

626
00:26:19.912 --> 00:26:22.539
<i>"We're not going to
acknowledge that you've won.</i>

627
00:26:22.664 --> 00:26:24.333
You're going to give
the belts back.

628
00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:25.542
[scoffs]

629
00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:26.960
<i>‐ Like. okay.</i>

630
00:26:27.044 --> 00:26:28.754
<i>Are we gonna have
another opportunity?</i>

631
00:26:28.837 --> 00:26:33.342
No. probably just gonna
go in other directions.

632
00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:34.760
<i>Unbelievably disappointed.</i>

633
00:26:34.843 --> 00:26:38.138
<i>because that's not what you
imagine that moment being.</i>

634
00:26:38.222 --> 00:26:40.099
<i>Done. it's over.</i>

635
00:26:44.353 --> 00:26:47.397
[crowd cheering]

636
00:26:47.523 --> 00:26:52.778
‐ <i>We were on the road
300 days a year for years.</i>

637
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:55.823
The same hotels.
same rental car.

638
00:26:55.906 --> 00:26:58.617
some of the same girls.

639
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.828
[crowd cheering]

640
00:27:00.911 --> 00:27:02.663
‐ <i>He kicked his own partner</i>

641
00:27:02.746 --> 00:27:04.498
<i>right in the face.</i>

642
00:27:04.581 --> 00:27:06.834
‐ <i>I remember we were
in Denver.</i>

643
00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:10.629
<i>Roddy Piper came in our room
and we had a few girls there.</i>

644
00:27:10.754 --> 00:27:13.715
and Roddy kept
bragging on Shawn.

645
00:27:13.841 --> 00:27:16.927
‐ <i>He was stirring up the pot
as far as saying.</i>

646
00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.554
you know. I could be a singles
and. you know.

647
00:27:18.679 --> 00:27:21.306
have great success
and things like that.

648
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:23.642
And he'd look at me and go
"We've got to work on you.

649
00:27:23.767 --> 00:27:25.894
You're still rough
around the edges."

650
00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:27.855
<i>I was like.
"Roddy. shouldn't we talk</i>

651
00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.773
<i>about that some other time?"</i>

652
00:27:29.857 --> 00:27:32.776
And Shawn shoved me
at that point.

653
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.820
[overlapping chatter]

654
00:27:34.903 --> 00:27:36.488
‐ <i>Everybody got in a fight</i>

655
00:27:36.572 --> 00:27:40.325
because everybody was not
in their best frame of mind.

656
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:41.702
like all the time.

657
00:27:41.785 --> 00:27:43.203
‐ <i>And he attacked me
in the hallway</i>

658
00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:45.914
<i>and then I didn't want to hit
him once. let alone.</i>

659
00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:47.833
you know. over and over.
Had blood.

660
00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:50.085
Like. it looked like you'd.
you know. gutted a deer

661
00:27:50.169 --> 00:27:51.295
or something.

662
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.172
‐ <i>There was speculation
that Marty Jannetty</i>

663
00:27:53.297 --> 00:27:55.090
<i>and Shawn Michaels
are not getting along.</i>

664
00:27:55.174 --> 00:27:56.967
<i>There was speculation
that Shawn Michaels</i>

665
00:27:57.009 --> 00:27:59.553
<i>is kinda wanting to go
on his own.</i>

666
00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:01.180
‐ <i>All of my success
at that point</i>

667
00:28:01.305 --> 00:28:05.017
was Tag Team. but there
was never a time in my career

668
00:28:05.142 --> 00:28:07.019
<i>where someone didn't
say to me.</i>

00:35:17.073 --> 00:35:18.366
<i>‐ Oh!</i>

839
00:35:18.491 --> 00:35:20.994
‐ <i>I was able
to have a presence</i>

840
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:23.747
<i>that I don't
think they knew that I had.</i>

841
00:35:23.872 --> 00:35:26.625
It isn't about size.
it is about presence.

842
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:28.877
[cheers and applause]

843
00:35:29.002 --> 00:35:30.462
<i>‐ Oh! Oh!</i>

844
00:35:30.587 --> 00:35:33.048
‐ <i>Shawn actually
lost the match.</i>

845
00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:35.634
but it put Shawn
at a different level

846
00:35:35.717 --> 00:35:38.011
that people believed

847
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:40.263
this little bastard
could do anything.

848
00:35:40.347 --> 00:35:43.600
[cheers and applause]

849
00:35:43.683 --> 00:35:49.022
<i>If you didn't before.
or you didn't want to believe.</i>

850
00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:56.696
Shawn made you believe.

851
00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.074
[thuds]

852
00:35:59.199 --> 00:36:00.700
‐ Should close it
and just drop it to the side.

853
00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:03.161
Boom and then you say.
"Okay. mister. here we go."

854
00:36:03.244 --> 00:36:04.412
You know. whatever.

855
00:36:04.537 --> 00:36:06.164
I don't know.
just throwing it out there.

856
00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:09.334
<i>This weekend. we have
one of our bigger events.</i>

857
00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:10.835
Five‐man ladder match.

858
00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.045
Is that gonna...

859
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.463
Someone will be holding
that right there.

860
00:36:13.546 --> 00:36:16.800
Many. many years ago.
it was just two of us

861
00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:18.301
and one ladder.

862
00:36:18.426 --> 00:36:19.678
<i>And now.
these young men and women</i>

863
00:36:19.803 --> 00:36:21.638
<i>have taken it to a whole
nother level.</i>

864
00:36:21.721 --> 00:36:23.348
Got a lot of moving parts
around here.

865
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:26.393
‐ I always dreamed
of being in a ladder match

866
00:36:26.476 --> 00:36:28.144
obviously because
of Shawn and Razor.

867
00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:30.146
[thuds]

868
00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:34.901
Ladder matches are about
crazy stunts. big falls.

869
00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:36.111
<i>it's a car crash come to life.</i>

870
00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:38.154
<i>He is the face
of the ladder match</i>

871
00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:39.572
<i>and to have him kind of
help us out.</i>

872
00:36:39.698 --> 00:36:42.158
have him kinda watch over us.
you can't dream it up.

873
00:36:42.242 --> 00:36:43.827
It's perfect.

874
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.579
There you go.

875
00:36:48.832 --> 00:36:51.376
[cheers and applause]

876
00:36:51.501 --> 00:36:54.713
<i>‐I met him
in the locker room. 1993.</i>

877
00:36:54.838 --> 00:36:56.131
<i>and wanted to know</i>

878
00:36:56.256 --> 00:36:59.134
if I'd be interested
in becoming his bodyguard.

879
00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:01.678
And the first thing out
of Shawn's mouth is.

880
00:37:01.761 --> 00:37:05.432
"Just so you know.
everybody hates us."

881
00:37:05.515 --> 00:37:08.268
<i>The bodyguard position
was 24/7.</i>

882
00:37:08.351 --> 00:37:11.438
<i>It wasn't just
on television persona.</i>

883
00:37:11.521 --> 00:37:13.648
a lot of people
didn't like him.

884
00:37:13.732 --> 00:37:16.484
‐ <i>Shawn Michaels
was misunderstood</i>

885
00:37:16.526 --> 00:37:17.986
<i>all throughout his career.</i>

886
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:19.571
There was a certain perception

887
00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:21.448
that he was
an ass[bleep]. frankly.

888
00:37:21.531 --> 00:37:23.241
<i>Shawn was selfish.</i>

889
00:37:23.366 --> 00:37:25.452
<i>Shawn did have
an out of control ego.</i>

890
00:37:25.535 --> 00:37:26.995
<i>and Shawn did
feel that he</i>

891
00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:28.413
<i>was better
than everybody else.</i>

892
00:37:28.538 --> 00:37:32.751
To be successful and to take
it to the next level.

893
00:37:32.834 --> 00:37:35.253
<i>you have to start looking out
for yourself.</i>

894
00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:37.464
<i>It's not a team sport.</i>

895
00:37:37.547 --> 00:37:39.549
‐ The one thing that was
the saving grace for Shawn

896
00:37:39.674 --> 00:37:44.137
was he was so good
in the ring.

897
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.680
<i>As a performer.
if you work with a guy</i>

898
00:37:45.764 --> 00:37:47.599
<i>that makes you look
that good.</i>

899
00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:49.142
<i>I don't care
what you think of him.</i>

900
00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:50.852
you want to work with him.

901
00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:54.481
‐ <i>Shawn Michaels.
Kevin Nash. Scott Hall.</i>

902
00:37:54.564 --> 00:37:57.650
<i>1‐2‐3 Kid. and then
Paul LeVesque. Triple H.</i>

903
00:37:57.734 --> 00:38:00.153
<i>these were guys that loved
hanging out together</i>

904
00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:05.867
and hence the Kliq
began to form.

905
00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:08.411
‐ We all just hit it off.
and then it was‐‐you know. we‐‐

906
00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:10.288
All we did was talk non‐stop
about the business and.

907
00:38:10.371 --> 00:38:13.750
you know. we were all just
so passionate about it.

908
00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:15.043
‐ <i>The perception was
that the Kliq</i>

909
00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:17.086
<i>was all‐knowing
and all‐powerful.</i>

910
00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.339
<i>and that if you crossed
the Kliq.</i>

911
00:38:19.422 --> 00:38:20.924
they'll just go Vince
and you'll be blackballed.

912
00:38:21.007 --> 00:38:22.884
‐ <i>They couldn't call
any of the shots.</i>

913
00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:26.429
but I listened. and they had
some really good ideas.

914
00:38:26.513 --> 00:38:28.348
Really smart. individually.

915
00:38:28.473 --> 00:38:31.309
And Shawn's very smart
when he's sober.

916
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.354
<i>Shawn had an attitude.</i>

917
00:38:34.437 --> 00:38:37.398
<i>when he drank even more so
on top of pills</i>

918
00:38:37.524 --> 00:38:38.775
<i>and Shawn would say.</i>

919
00:38:38.858 --> 00:38:41.820
you know. the wrong thing
at the wrong time.

920
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:44.656
<i>And he was protected
in a WB environment.</i>

921
00:38:44.781 --> 00:38:49.369
You know.
but outside that environment‐‐

922
00:38:49.494 --> 00:38:50.995
‐ Shawn Michaels.
British Bulldog.

923
00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.831
<i>1‐2‐3 Kid walk into a bar.</i>

924
00:38:52.914 --> 00:38:56.042
Me. Scott. and Kev
were in Europe.

925
00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:58.419
It was where we find out
that this all happened.

926
00:38:58.503 --> 00:39:00.463
<i>Bunch of Marines
in a tough bar.</i>

927
00:39:00.547 --> 00:39:04.008
<i>Every eye in that place turns
to the three wrestlers</i>

928
00:39:04.092 --> 00:39:05.385
<i>that just walked
in the door.</i>

929
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.762
<i>of which Shawn
is the megastar.</i>

930
00:39:07.846 --> 00:39:10.473
Every girl in that place
starts to look at Shawn.

931
00:39:10.598 --> 00:39:12.517
Shawn is very enamored
with that.

932
00:39:12.642 --> 00:39:14.060
and Shawn is at
this point in his life.

933
00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:18.273
like. "[bleep] you lookin' at?
Is there a problem. jarhead?"

934
00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:20.275
They go to walk out.
six Marines walk out.

935
00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:21.526
beat the [bleep] out of Shawn

936
00:39:21.651 --> 00:39:24.654
and leave him in the side
of the car.

937
00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:26.489
‐ <i>And the last
thing I can remember is.</i>

938
00:39:26.614 --> 00:39:28.241
<i>you know.
there being the coat check.</i>

939
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:31.578
The next thing is waking up
in the hospital.

940
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:36.040
<i>And everything
else is a complete blank.</i>

941
00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:37.709
<i>That was four days</i>

942
00:39:37.834 --> 00:39:41.337
<i>out of a seven day week.
situations like that.</i>

943
00:39:41.462 --> 00:39:43.715
<i>Getting beat up by nine guys
in Syracuse.</i>

944
00:39:43.798 --> 00:39:45.133
to me. there's not
a whole lot of shame in.

945
00:39:45.258 --> 00:39:48.428
You know. that kind of stuff
just sort of happens to me.

946
00:39:48.511 --> 00:39:49.721
I've got two choices‐‐

947
00:39:49.804 --> 00:39:52.432
sit home and cry.
or to come out and be a pain.

948
00:39:52.515 --> 00:39:55.643
And I got news for you.
folks. I'm all cried out.

949
00:39:55.768 --> 00:39:56.853
‐ This moment of existence

950
00:39:56.978 --> 00:39:59.272
was the 20 minutes
in the ring every night.

951
00:39:59.355 --> 00:40:01.024
<i>He wouldn't be messed up.</i>

952
00:40:01.107 --> 00:40:02.692
<i>He'd go in there
and he'd kill it every night.</i>

953
00:40:02.775 --> 00:40:05.069
and then the second
he was done‐‐

954
00:40:05.194 --> 00:40:06.863
[clicks tongue]

955
00:40:06.946 --> 00:40:09.490
"I'm in pain.
and I took some stuff.

956
00:40:09.574 --> 00:40:11.451
<i>"so I wouldn't be
in pain this morning.</i>

957
00:40:11.534 --> 00:40:12.744
<i>but I'm messed up."</i>

958
00:40:12.827 --> 00:40:14.662
Why would you hang out
with this misery 24/7?

959
00:40:14.704 --> 00:40:16.748
No. it's not.
It's again like your brother.

960
00:40:16.873 --> 00:40:18.750
It's like a family member.

961
00:40:18.875 --> 00:40:20.793
Shawn owes his life
to Triple H.

962
00:40:20.877 --> 00:40:24.047
Paul Leveque.
owes his life to him.

963
00:40:24.172 --> 00:40:25.465
<i>‐ Shawn Michaels knows</i>

964
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.426
<i>that the greatest match
of his life</i>

965
00:40:28.509 --> 00:40:31.304
<i>must come this Sunday night.</i>

966
00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:33.806
By the time
you get to the mid‐90s.

967
00:40:33.932 --> 00:40:36.184
<i>Bret Hart
has become a crowd favorite.</i>

968
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:40.813
<i>Bret is a very soft‐spoken.
quiet. Canadian gentleman.</i>

969
00:40:40.939 --> 00:40:44.776
<i>Shawn is an outspoken.
loud. brash American.</i>

970
00:40:44.859 --> 00:40:48.947
Only one person can
be the absolute alpha dog.

971
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:52.617
<i>The Iron Man match.
the boyhood dream realized.</i>

972
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:57.372
<i>it added another layer to the
Shawn Michaels character.</i>

973
00:40:57.497 --> 00:40:58.498
‐ <i>The Iron Man match.</i>

974
00:40:58.623 --> 00:41:00.333
it's the opportunity
where I get to.

975
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:02.919
you know. get
my first world championship.

976
00:41:03.002 --> 00:41:05.797
‐ <i>There's only one
Heartbreak Kid!</i>

977
00:41:05.838 --> 00:41:10.218
<i>Unbelievable. what a ride!</i>

978
00:41:10.343 --> 00:41:12.011
‐ <i>An hour‐long match.</i>

979
00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:14.806
it's gonna be a long night at
the office. in wrestling terms.

980
00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:19.394
‐ <i>For the WWE Championship!</i>

981
00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:21.479
‐ We start to have our issues.

982
00:41:21.604 --> 00:41:24.649
You know. I was never
big on the Kliq idea.

983
00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:27.110
<i>It was a testy match
in a lot of ways.</i>

984
00:41:27.193 --> 00:41:29.278
‐ <i>Hart's in big trouble.</i>

985
00:41:29.362 --> 00:41:31.406
[cheers and applause]

986
00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:33.199
‐ <i>There was a famous part</i>

987
00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:34.659
where I jump off
the second rope.

988
00:41:34.784 --> 00:41:36.285
[groans]

989
00:41:36.369 --> 00:41:38.663
<i>He comes up and kicks me
in the face</i>

990
00:41:38.705 --> 00:41:39.872
<i>as hard as he could.</i>

991
00:41:39.998 --> 00:41:41.165
I mean. he almost
knocked me out.

992
00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:42.500
<i>‐ Oh. my goodness!</i>

993
00:41:42.583 --> 00:41:44.293
We stiff each other a lot
of times in that match.

994
00:41:44.419 --> 00:41:47.213
[cheering and chatter]

995
00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:50.299
‐ One. two. out!

996
00:41:50.425 --> 00:41:52.969
[bell dings]

997
00:41:53.094 --> 00:41:57.432
‐ <i>The boyhood dream
has come true!</i>

998
00:41:57.515 --> 00:41:59.058
‐ <i>The boyhood dream has
come true.</i>

999
00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:02.645
because that was Shawn's
boyhood dream. it was.

1000
00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:04.856
And that's exactly
what happened.

1001
00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:07.608
‐ <i>It was a very
big moment for my career.</i>

1002
00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:09.736
It's like. oh. it's the first
World Championship

1003
00:42:09.819 --> 00:42:11.988
and you go like. "Hmm.
I pictured it being different."

1004
00:42:12.071 --> 00:42:14.824
<i>I wasn't at a good place
and all that kinda stuff.</i>

1005
00:42:14.949 --> 00:42:18.077
<i>Just a lot of responsibility
that goes with that.</i>

1006
00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:20.246
Now every guy in that locker
room. their well‐being.

1007
00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:24.333
their life. you know.
their livelihood and all that

1008
00:42:24.417 --> 00:42:26.502
depends on the job
that you do.

1009
00:42:26.627 --> 00:42:29.672
<i>You know. it all
falls on your shoulders.</i>

1010
00:42:29.756 --> 00:42:31.299
The whole thing
was uncomfortable.

1011
00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:37.889
‐ <i>As we got into 1996.
Ted Turner. who owned WCW.</i>

00:42:37.972 --> 00:42:41.642
<i>our competitors.
was being very aggressive</i>

1013
00:42:41.684 --> 00:42:45.480
in his quest for new talent.

1014
00:42:45.605 --> 00:42:47.732
<i>Scott Hall and Kevin Nash.</i>

1015
00:42:47.857 --> 00:42:52.612
they were going to leave
and go to Ted Turner's WCW.

1016
00:42:52.695 --> 00:42:54.822
<i>The last matches being</i>

1017
00:42:54.947 --> 00:42:58.618
<i>in New York
in Madison Square Garden.</i>

1018
00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:01.370
‐ <i>On my 19th. 1996.</i>

1019
00:43:01.454 --> 00:43:04.123
one of the greatest days
of wrestling.

1020
00:43:04.207 --> 00:43:05.833
and my life as well.

1021
00:43:05.958 --> 00:43:08.544
<i>Me and my friend went
to a house show</i>

1022
00:43:08.669 --> 00:43:09.962
<i>which was not televised.</i>

1023
00:43:10.088 --> 00:43:11.881
<i>we would sneak in
a camera past security</i>

1024
00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:14.509
<i>and we would film the shows.</i>

1025
00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:18.387
Shawn was my hero
and was my idol growing up.

1026
00:43:18.471 --> 00:43:19.931
[audience cheering]

1027
00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:21.557
<i>The ending shows
Shawn Michaels</i>

1028
00:43:21.682 --> 00:43:23.267
<i>giving Diesel a super kick.</i>

1029
00:43:23.351 --> 00:43:25.645
Match is over.

1030
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:28.231
<i>And then all of a sudden
Razor Ramon comes out.</i>

1031
00:43:28.356 --> 00:43:29.816
<i>I'm like. "Oh. cool."</i>

1032
00:43:29.899 --> 00:43:32.485
They start hugging and I'm
screaming like a little girl.

1033
00:43:32.568 --> 00:43:34.070
<i>Oh. my God!</i>

1034
00:43:34.195 --> 00:43:35.363
<i>Who's this?</i>

1035
00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:37.073
<i>And it turns out to be
Hunter Hurst Helmsley.</i>

1036
00:43:37.156 --> 00:43:40.243
They all start hugging and. you
know. obviously saying goodbye.

1037
00:43:40.368 --> 00:43:43.329
<i>It was insane.
That night was magical.</i>

1038
00:43:43.371 --> 00:43:45.665
<i>Yeah!</i>

1039
00:43:45.748 --> 00:43:47.166
<i>The business was
well protected</i>

1040
00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:50.670
<i>up until then. and our cameras
still kept going.</i>

1041
00:43:50.753 --> 00:43:52.672
<i>The only camera
that was there.</i>

1042
00:43:52.755 --> 00:43:55.633
If we were not involved
in taping the curtain call.

1043
00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:59.387
it would not be talked
about as much today.

1044
00:43:59.512 --> 00:44:01.139
‐ <i>Place is going insane.</i>

1045
00:44:01.222 --> 00:44:03.558
Everybody knows everything
on the inside of the business.

1046
00:44:03.683 --> 00:44:05.017
There's no secrets.

1047
00:44:05.143 --> 00:44:06.644
<i>‐ People in the business
didn't like it.</i>

1048
00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:09.230
They thought it was
the worst thing that happened.

1049
00:44:09.355 --> 00:44:11.566
Here's this bad guy.
who we have no idea

1050
00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:13.985
is friends with all
these other guys.

1051
00:44:14.026 --> 00:44:16.362
‐ <i>It's breaking
the fourth wall</i>

1052
00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:17.864
<i>and just telling people.</i>

1053
00:44:17.947 --> 00:44:19.323
<i>"Everything we just did
is bull [bleep]. "</i>

1054
00:44:19.407 --> 00:44:22.827
Shawn Michaels is now hugging
and kissing the guy

1055
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:25.997
that he's just spent 20 minutes
beating the hell out of.

1056
00:44:26.038 --> 00:44:27.540
We entertained you.
but now it's all over.

1057
00:44:27.623 --> 00:44:31.210
we're really good buddies.
Taboo in the wrestling business.

1058
00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:34.714
‐ <i>The tape
was leaked out to a writer.</i>

1059
00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:36.924
The tape blows up on its own.

1060
00:44:37.008 --> 00:44:38.843
‐ <i>I had no idea
that was gonna happen.</i>

1061
00:44:38.926 --> 00:44:41.846
It was something
that's never been done before.

1062
00:44:41.929 --> 00:44:46.601
I'm watching this and going.
"What the hell is going on?"

1063
00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:49.103
The Kliq was an insult
to our business.

1064
00:44:49.187 --> 00:44:51.272
If they had done that
in the '70s. early '80s.

1065
00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:53.608
they'd all four of them get
the [bleep] beat out of 'em.

1066
00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:57.862
They wrestle each other and
they all kiss and say goodbye.

1067
00:44:57.945 --> 00:44:59.780
‐ Somebody's gotta
go down for it.

1068
00:44:59.864 --> 00:45:02.992
<i>Kev's gone. Scott's gone.
Shawn's the champ.</i>

1069
00:45:03.075 --> 00:45:08.497
Stuff rolls downhill and.
yeah. it all rolled on me.

1070
00:45:08.581 --> 00:45:10.166
‐ <i>Triple H is the one</i>

1071
00:45:10.249 --> 00:45:13.336
<i>that probably paid
the heaviest price</i>

1072
00:45:13.461 --> 00:45:15.296
<i>as far as his career</i>

1073
00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:18.424
<i>kind of hitting
a roadblock at that point.</i>

1074
00:45:18.507 --> 00:45:20.134
Shawn didn't really
pay a price.

1075
00:45:20.218 --> 00:45:22.637
‐ <i>I was inherently
selfish regardless.</i>

1076
00:45:22.762 --> 00:45:27.475
so I'm sure I didn't feel
the compassion for him.

1077
00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:32.188
as maybe I should have.

1078
00:45:32.313 --> 00:45:34.690
‐ <i>There was a bit
of a shutdown on Shawn.</i>

1079
00:45:34.815 --> 00:45:37.652
<i>Business is‐‐it's okay.
but it's not great.</i>

1080
00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:38.945
<i>You know.
there's a lot of banter</i>

1081
00:45:39.028 --> 00:45:41.447
about Shawn's not
working as champion.

1082
00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:43.324
He's not drawing.

1083
00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:45.534
<i>He's collapsing
under the pressure.</i>

1084
00:45:45.618 --> 00:45:47.495
<i>I can see him
falling apart.</i>

1085
00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:51.165
Kevin and Scott are gone.
and I'm all he's got now.

1086
00:45:51.249 --> 00:45:52.416
<i>He's a mess.</i>

1087
00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:55.753
‐ <i>I felt a lot of pressure
and I didn't handle it well.</i>

1088
00:45:55.836 --> 00:45:57.672
For me. it was all about

1089
00:45:57.755 --> 00:45:59.590
running and escaping.
and honestly.

1090
00:45:59.674 --> 00:46:01.092
you know. there was running

1091
00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:03.135
and escaping from the dude
I'd become.

1092
00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:05.054
Better than having
to face that.

1093
00:46:05.137 --> 00:46:08.349
I might just take a few
of these and knock myself out.

1094
00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:10.810
Won't have to pay attention
to it till tomorrow.

1095
00:46:10.893 --> 00:46:12.520
‐ <i>He'd be pilled up.
passed out.</i>

1096
00:46:12.645 --> 00:46:16.232
put Shawn on a luggage cart
and roll him up to his room.

1097
00:46:16.315 --> 00:46:18.859
<i>and get him undressed.
take the dip out of his mouth.</i>

1098
00:46:18.985 --> 00:46:20.361
<i>and put him on his side.
put a pillow behind him</i>

1099
00:46:20.486 --> 00:46:22.446
<i>so he wouldn't roll over and
choke to death in his sleep.</i>

1100
00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:25.324
And set an alarm and get up
every two. three hours

1101
00:46:25.408 --> 00:46:26.575
to go check on him.

1102
00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:28.202
<i>And that was every night.</i>

1103
00:46:28.286 --> 00:46:32.206
Well. you know. every night?
Sad existence.

1104
00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:38.671
<i>[cheers and applause]</i>

1105
00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:40.965
‐ <i>What everybody
has to understand</i>

1106
00:46:41.007 --> 00:46:43.301
<i>about Shawn Michaels
is this‐‐</i>

1107
00:46:43.342 --> 00:46:44.635
If I wanna come out here

1108
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.639
and look like a blithering
idiot on live TV.

1109
00:46:48.681 --> 00:46:50.850
believe me. I'm gonna do it.

1110
00:46:50.933 --> 00:46:54.228
Why?
Because I can.

1111
00:46:54.353 --> 00:46:56.772
‐ <i>He had a drug problem
for a while.</i>

1112
00:46:56.856 --> 00:46:58.316
<i>a serious one.</i>

1113
00:46:58.357 --> 00:47:02.611
<i>and he kind of fell
in the hole even deeper.</i>

1114
00:47:02.695 --> 00:47:06.157
But it wasn't until
he became champion

1115
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.659
that I felt that Shawn. uh.

1116
00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:12.747
started to question himself.

1117
00:47:12.872 --> 00:47:14.999
‐ <i>I called his dad.
the colonel.</i>

1118
00:47:15.082 --> 00:47:16.917
<i>and said.
"I'd like to visit."</i>

1119
00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:18.794
So I flew down to meet him

1120
00:47:18.919 --> 00:47:21.297
and I'm saying. "You're probably
not aware of this.

1121
00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:24.592
Shawn really
has a drug problem."

1122
00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:26.052
The colonel got angry.

1123
00:47:26.177 --> 00:47:29.472
He just didn't want to hear it.

1124
00:47:29.597 --> 00:47:31.932
‐ I don't know that anybody
knew how to address it.

1125
00:47:32.016 --> 00:47:34.101
<i>Even things like rehab.
my parents.</i>

1126
00:47:34.185 --> 00:47:35.311
you know. God love 'em.

1127
00:47:35.394 --> 00:47:37.897
I don't that they knew
what it was that you did.

1128
00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.231
<i>except just to be worried.</i>

1129
00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:42.443
<i>Not long after that
I tweaked my knee.</i>

1130
00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:44.653
[cheers and applause]

1131
00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:46.322
<i>I went to this dude
in San Antonio</i>

1132
00:47:46.405 --> 00:47:48.824
<i>who doesn't know anything
about wrestling.</i>

1133
00:47:48.866 --> 00:47:50.326
and obviously sees
I've torn my ACL

1134
00:47:50.368 --> 00:47:52.244
and he's like.
"Dude. you're done."

1135
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:56.499
You know. he said. "You're not
wrestling with a torn ACL."

1136
00:47:56.582 --> 00:48:00.044
<i>I know that over
the last several months.</i>

1137
00:48:00.169 --> 00:48:01.962
I've lost a lot of things.

1138
00:48:02.046 --> 00:48:03.464
and one of them
has been my smile.

1139
00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:06.634
‐ <i>He went in the ring
to announce he was retiring</i>

1140
00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:08.469
'cause he had a bad knee.

1141
00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:10.679
<i>I didn't believe his knee
was the issue.</i>

1142
00:48:10.805 --> 00:48:12.598
<i>I always thought
the issue was</i>

1143
00:48:12.681 --> 00:48:15.851
he didn't want to wrestle me
at WrestleMania 13

1144
00:48:15.976 --> 00:48:17.436
<i>and drop the belt to me.</i>

1145
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.524
I doubted Shawn's integrity
as far as his injury went.

1146
00:48:21.649 --> 00:48:22.650
You phony little faker.

1147
00:48:22.775 --> 00:48:24.318
why don't you take your little
pussyfoot injury‐‐

1148
00:48:24.402 --> 00:48:25.528
‐ All right.
all right. knock it off.

1149
00:48:25.611 --> 00:48:28.072
No. no. no.
‐ It's all right.

1150
00:48:28.197 --> 00:48:29.323
I'm not going anywhere.

1151
00:48:29.407 --> 00:48:30.991
‐ And go back
and find your smile.

1152
00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:32.410
‐ <i>I got accused
of faking it.</i>

1153
00:48:32.535 --> 00:48:33.953
<i>Bret told everybody
I was faking it.</i>

1154
00:48:34.036 --> 00:48:37.832
My excuse is drug addicts
lie all the time.

1155
00:48:37.873 --> 00:48:39.166
Well. there's no doubt

1156
00:48:39.208 --> 00:48:41.043
that you found your smile
again as you stated...

1157
00:48:41.168 --> 00:48:42.795
‐ <i>A year off
of the wrestling business</i>

1158
00:48:42.878 --> 00:48:43.963
<i>was a year of no pay.</i>

1159
00:48:44.088 --> 00:48:47.133
That's just not‐‐
That isn't feasible.

1160
00:48:47.174 --> 00:48:49.343
And they said. "Well. look.
you can put a brace on it

1161
00:48:49.468 --> 00:48:51.011
and wrap it up."

1162
00:48:51.137 --> 00:48:52.805
They went and they got me
a brace and everything else.

1163
00:48:52.888 --> 00:48:55.015
I was like. "Okay.
I can do this."

1164
00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:58.144
And it is time
for the Heartbreak Kid.

1165
00:48:58.185 --> 00:49:00.980
Shawn Michaels
to return to action!

1166
00:49:01.021 --> 00:49:02.398
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

1167
00:49:02.523 --> 00:49:05.860
<i>‐This was a moment where
things needed to change.</i>

1168
00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:07.820
Business was bad.

1169
00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:09.321

would go too far.

If something bothered Bret.
I made sure that I did it.

He stabbed the WWE in the back.

1234
00:51:49.231 --> 00:51:52.484
Why? For his financial gain.

1235

00:52:03.245 --> 00:52:07.333
And we finally had a fisticuff
in the dressing room.

1240
00:52:07.416 --> 00:52:09.251

just got into a fight</i>

1241
00:52:09.335 --> 00:52:11.545
and pulled each other hair
in the locker room. What?

1242
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:13.130
I run over there
and find Shawn.

1243
00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:14.673
he's got a big chunk
of hair missing

1244
00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:16.008

"What are you doing?"

<i>but Bret's on his way to WCW.</i>

1255
00:52:45.371 --> 00:52:49.458

the title to Shawn.

1256

<i>But they couldn't let Bret
leave with the title.</i>

00:56:19.418 --> 00:56:20.627
And I'll never forget.

1336
00:56:20.752 --> 00:56:23.589
he put his arms out like this.
and he just looked up

1337
00:56:23.672 --> 00:56:26.967
and he goes.
"You could have had all this."

1338
00:56:27.092 --> 00:56:29.678
But I realize. you know.
somewhere along the way.

1339
00:56:29.761 --> 00:56:31.889
that I saw him lose so much.

1340
00:56:32.014 --> 00:56:33.181
<i>He got into drugs</i>

1341
00:56:33.307 --> 00:56:35.893
<i>and there were some really bad
side effects to his fame.</i>

1342
00:56:36.018 --> 00:56:38.437
‐ <i>I looked at Kenny
a lot of times.</i>

1343
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.480
<i>and having a wife
and a family.</i>

1344
00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:43.567
<i>and just being as happy
as can be.</i>

1345
00:56:43.692 --> 00:56:45.360
And I've always looked
at and admired.

1346
00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:49.615
and thought it was pretty
enviable to have.

1347
00:56:49.698 --> 00:56:52.451
<i>But in my line of work.
it was always wondering</i>

1348
00:56:52.534 --> 00:56:56.997
<i>can you have both.
or is that not possible?</i>

1349
00:56:57.122 --> 00:56:59.291
<i>They don't mix.</i>

1350
00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:02.711
<i>[cheers and applause]</i>

1351
00:57:02.794 --> 00:57:07.007
‐ <i>The following
contest is a casket match</i>

1352
00:57:07.132 --> 00:57:11.553
<i>for the WWE Championship!</i>

1353
00:57:11.678 --> 00:57:13.639
<i>[cheers and applause]</i>

1354
00:57:13.764 --> 00:57:15.182
‐ <i>This casket match</i>

1355
00:57:15.307 --> 00:57:19.227
<i>is the Undertaker's specialty.</i>

1356
00:57:19.311 --> 00:57:21.063
<i>‐ The object of a casket match</i>

1357
00:57:21.146 --> 00:57:22.898
is to beat your opponent down
far enough

1358
00:57:22.981 --> 00:57:25.901
that you can throw them
into the casket or coffin

1359
00:57:26.026 --> 00:57:26.860
and shut the lid.

1360
00:57:26.985 --> 00:57:30.656
And if you do that.
you win the match.

1361
00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:33.659
<i>Somewhere through the course
of that match.</i>

1362
00:57:33.742 --> 00:57:37.996
I threw him over
this giant coffin...

1363
00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:40.123
[grunts]

1364
00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:41.500
‐ <i>Michaels' back dropped</i>

1365
00:57:41.583 --> 00:57:43.460
on that big old wooden casket.

1366
00:57:43.543 --> 00:57:46.380
I wanted to clear it
and go to the floor.

1367
00:57:46.505 --> 00:57:48.799
<i>and I just didn't quite
get far enough.</i>

1368
00:57:48.924 --> 00:57:50.550
<i>and bam.
I just hit the corner.</i>

1369
00:57:50.676 --> 00:57:52.636
But I didn't really
think much about it.

1370
00:57:52.719 --> 00:57:53.971
You know.
you still finish the match.

1371
00:57:54.054 --> 00:57:56.264
<i>‐ Look at the look
on his face!</i>

1372
00:57:56.348 --> 00:57:57.975
<i>The Undertaker
dragging Michaels</i>

1373
00:57:58.058 --> 00:58:00.602
<i>right down into
the depths of Hell!</i>

1374
00:58:00.686 --> 00:58:03.063
The next day. I just
remember getting up like.

1375
00:58:03.188 --> 00:58:07.818
ah. you know. waking up
and not being able to move.

1376
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:10.654
<i>First time I recall
being in that much pain.</i>

1377
00:58:10.696 --> 00:58:13.156
We do all the X‐rays.

1378
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.282
<i>Apparently. I blew a disc.</i>

1379
00:58:14.366 --> 00:58:17.869
and that's the kind of stuff
that needs to be fused.

1380
00:58:17.995 --> 00:58:20.831
Doctor says. "Oh.
you can't wrestle after that."

1381
00:58:20.956 --> 00:58:23.834
[explosion]
[cheers and applause]

1382
00:58:23.917 --> 00:58:27.045
He said I'm never gonna wrestle
again. yadda. yadda. yadda.

1383
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:28.714
And I said.
"Nobody tells me what to do.

1384
00:58:28.839 --> 00:58:31.717
so we're going
to WrestleMania with Steve."

1385
00:58:31.842 --> 00:58:34.761
You have never.
ever had one of these!

1386
00:58:34.845 --> 00:58:36.430
So you give me enough drugs.
all right.

1387
00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:41.143
so let's do whatever we can
to get me to WrestleMania.

1388
00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:45.439
‐ <i>Getting Shawn
to WrestleMania was a battle.</i>

1389
00:58:45.522 --> 00:58:50.360
He had a bad back.
he was heavily medicated.

1390
00:58:50.485 --> 00:58:52.487
He is the WWE Champion

1391
00:58:52.612 --> 00:58:53.822
and the man who will
defend his title

1392
00:58:53.905 --> 00:58:54.823
against Stone Cold.

1393
00:58:54.906 --> 00:58:56.950
with Mike Tyson
as the Enforcer.

1394
00:58:57.034 --> 00:58:59.411
Here. ladies and gentlemen.
Shawn Michaels.

1395
00:58:59.536 --> 00:59:01.204
‐ <i>I choose to make an ass</i>

1396
00:59:01.329 --> 00:59:04.207
out of a toughest SOB.

1397
00:59:04.332 --> 00:59:06.084
I can do that anytime I want.

1398
00:59:07.878 --> 00:59:11.923
[overlapping chatter]

1399
00:59:12.007 --> 00:59:13.925
‐ <i>I was gonna
have to dope myself up</i>

1400
00:59:14.009 --> 00:59:15.761
and drop the belt to Steve.

1401
00:59:15.844 --> 00:59:18.764
and then I guess
I'll let my career be over.

1402
00:59:18.847 --> 00:59:20.599
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

1403
00:59:20.682 --> 00:59:22.100
‐ <i>He was bitter.</i>

1404
00:59:22.184 --> 00:59:24.436
<i>It had nothing to do
with him losing.</i>

1405
00:59:24.519 --> 00:59:25.979
it had to do with being
replaced.

1406
00:59:26.104 --> 00:59:29.107
He never had his moment.
He never had his run.

1407
00:59:29.191 --> 00:59:30.650
I'm still the greatest.
And then this‐‐

1408
00:59:30.776 --> 00:59:31.985
Now it's his run.

1409
00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:35.405
What do I do?
Now I'm the backup guy?

1410
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:36.531
One of the most
messed‐up things

1411
00:59:36.656 --> 00:59:37.991
I ever heard Shawn say
in his life is.

1412
00:59:38.075 --> 00:59:39.409
"I should've taken
so many pills.

1413
00:59:39.493 --> 00:59:40.869
"I died after WrestleMania 10.

1414
00:59:40.994 --> 00:59:42.704
"I'd have been
the biggest star of all time.

1415
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:45.665
I'd have been Elvis."

1416
00:59:45.791 --> 00:59:47.084
‐ <i>It's hopelessness.</i>

1417
00:59:47.167 --> 00:59:49.044
<i>and certainly.
that's where I was.</i>

1418
00:59:49.169 --> 00:59:52.798
I am not just. uh. you know.
a drug addict.

1419
00:59:52.881 --> 00:59:53.799
I'm an angry one.

1420
00:59:53.924 --> 00:59:56.259
<i>and I mean angrier than ever.</i>

1421
00:59:56.343 --> 00:59:59.096
<i>At that time in my life.
that's all I had.</i>

1422
00:59:59.179 --> 01:00:02.974
I identified who I was with
what I was doing in that ring.

1423
01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.728
And without it. I wouldn't have
known what to do with my life.

1424
01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:08.563
[cheers and applause]

1425
01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:10.732
<i>‐ On the day
of WrestleMania 14.</i>

1426
01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:12.651
<i>we barely talked.</i>

1427
01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:14.945
He didn't feel like doing
business with me.

1428
01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:18.824
Triple H was a conduit
between most of it.

1429
01:00:18.907 --> 01:00:20.450
‐ <i>He was pissed.</i>

1430
01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:22.410
<i>He wasn't about to talk
to Steve about this match.</i>

1431
01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:25.330
I helped him put it together
by going from room to room.

1432
01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:27.874
and it was just‐‐it was
so difficult to do.

1433
01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:30.794
‐ <i>It was difficult.
I remember that day.</i>

1434
01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:34.798
I'm thinking. I don't know
what Shawn's going to do.

1435
01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:36.133
‐ <i>He's retiring.</i>

1436
01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:39.177
you know. this could be
his final screw you.

1437
01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:42.639
‐ <i>Nobody has ever.
ever outperformed</i>

1438
01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:46.268
<i>Shawn Michaels
in a big match situation.</i>

1439
01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:47.769
‐ <i>I'm not in great shape.</i>

1440
01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:51.815
<i>My back. pretty bad
being in that much pain.</i>

1441
01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:54.151
Get the cortisone shots
and stuff like that.

1442
01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:56.319
‐ <i>Oh. my God!</i>

1443
01:00:56.444 --> 01:00:59.614
I feel like I'm putting him
over. that's good enough.

1444
01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:03.326
‐ Awesome. he got it!
The Stunner!

1445
01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:05.871
<i>Mike Tyson in!</i>

1446
01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.081
<i>[cheers and applause]</i>

1447
01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.541
‐ <i>Shawn's always
been a troublemaker.</i>

1448
01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:12.002
he always wants to get in your
face. talk [bleep].

1449
01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:13.962
Even when he's
on your team. he was talking.

1450
01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:16.923
<i>He's an irritant.
that's what he is.</i>

1451
01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:22.804
Shawn. um. has sour grapes.

1452
01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.472
[cheers and applause]

1453
01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:26.474
<i>‐ Tyson! Tyson!</i>

1454
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.893
‐ It was kind of a close blow.

1455
01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:33.690
'cause Shawn was pretty much
out for a little while.

1456
01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:35.692
<i>‐ Tyson takes
the Austin 3:16 shirt</i>

1457
01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:37.777
<i>and lays it
across Shawn's chest.</i>

1458
01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.654
<i>This was adding
insult to injury.</i>

1459
01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:41.823
and this was rubbing salt
in the wound.

1460
01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.909
I would have been pissed too.

1461
01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.994
‐ <i>Not exactly the screw job.</i>

1462
01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:48.747
<i>but it was them
getting the last laugh</i>

1463
01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:51.666
as far as. you know.
"Good. little prick.

1464
01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.210
"you put us through hell
this week.

1465
01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:55.420
but we're at least gonna
get you going out the door."

1466
01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:57.797
‐ The new WWE Champion.

1467
01:01:57.839 --> 01:02:00.133
Stone Cold Steve Austin.

1468
01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:01.509
[applause]

1469
01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:03.803
He was going
to that press conference

1470
01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:06.389
<i>to just let everybody
know I'm pissed off.</i>

1471
01:02:06.514 --> 01:02:10.435
<i>He walked in the door
and he yelled some stuff.</i>

1472
01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:11.811
<i>‐ Oh. yeah. It's [bleep] up.</i>

1473
01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:13.855
It was just‐‐it's selfish
and it's stupid.

1474
01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.859
but. you know. that's
where he was at that time.

1475
01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:20.820
‐ Shawn is suffering
from ruptured disc

1476
01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.573
as we speak.
and will not participate

1477
01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:25.158
at this press conference.

1478
01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:28.536
Nonetheless. he participated.
uh. in the arena

1479
01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.163
in an extraordinary way.

1480
01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:31.581
and there is
no athlete in the world

1481
01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:35.418
that can say they can do
what Shawn Michaels does.

1482
01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:36.211
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

1483
01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:43.301
<i>[soft music]</i>

1484
01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.637
‐ <i>I got on the plane
the next morning</i>

1485
01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:49.808
and went home and began to.
I don't know.

1486
01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:52.018
let it all sort of sink in.

1487
01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:53.520
<i>It takes some time</i>

1488
01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:57.357
<i>before it goes from being
time off to the reality</i>

1489
01:02:57.482 --> 01:03:00.944
of how exactly is the rest
of your life gonna go

1490
01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:04.364
when you're done at 33?

1491
01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:07.450
Okay. see if I can
get one done here.

1492
01:03:07.534 --> 01:03:09.202
<i>All they knew at the time</i>

1493
01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:12.330
<i>was stuff like that.
you don't recover from.</i>

1494
01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.624
people don't get back
in the ring and wrestle again.

1495
01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:15.959
The thing is.

1496
01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:19.796
I can't keep coming out here
week after week after week

1497
01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.298
going back and forth
with all this.

1498
01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:23.967
I get to get busy with my
rehab‐‐

1499
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.635
My physical therapy.

1500
01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:28.513
My physical therapy
for my back.

1501
01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:29.597
[sighs]

1502
01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:33.059
Now I've got a legitimate
reason to have pain pills

1503
01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:37.731
<i>and I've got a prescription
and everything else.</i>

1504
01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:39.190
I just wanna be a pro wrestler.

1505
01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:41.484
That's what I was trying
to go back to.

1506
01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:45.530
<i>So I began to start the Shawn
Michaels Wrestling Academy.</i>

1507
01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.824
<i>We had a couple of rings.
I had a little workout room.</i>

1508
01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:50.952
<i>There were a couple of guys
that came through my school</i>

1509
01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:53.830
<i>that went on to have
WWE success.</i>

1510
01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.582
<i>It was a great experience.
it really was.</i>

1511
01:03:55.707 --> 01:03:59.336
<i>I did it for about
two and a half. three years.</i>

1512
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:03.506
<i>So I'm at home.
and I'm watching TV.</i>

1513
01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:04.799
<i>and then all of a sudden</i>

1514
01:04:04.883 --> 01:04:06.343
<i>the introduction
of this new Nitro Girl.</i>

1515
01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:10.055
‐ <i>Tampa Bay
girl herself. Whisper.</i>

1516
01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:15.018
And she's out there
with this chair.

1517
01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:20.106
just doing this dance.
and it's captivating.

1518
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.526
And she's absolutely the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

1519
01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:25.779
<i>[soft music]</i>

1520
01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:27.405
‐ <i>We were at a rehearsal</i>

1521
01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:29.157
<i>and one
of the Nitro Girls. Spice.</i>

1522
01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.368
<i>had mentioned to me that
a man named Shawn Michaels.</i>

1523
01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:33.953
a former wrestler.
wanted to meet me

1524
01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:35.830
and that was the first time
I'd ever heard of him.

1525
01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:36.998
I called her up.

1526
01:04:37.082 --> 01:04:38.875
We probably
talked for three hours

1527
01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:40.668
on the phone each night
for two weeks.

1528
01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:42.670
‐ Two weeks of talking
and emailing.

1529
01:04:42.754 --> 01:04:46.716
and then I flew out
to San Antonio to see him.

1530
01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:49.010
and we dated
for about two weeks.

1531
01:04:49.094 --> 01:04:50.637
<i>After that he told me
he loved me.</i>

1532
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.888
<i>and I told him I loved him.</i>

1533
01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:53.973
Two weeks after that.
we got married.

1534
01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:57.769
‐ It was the Graceland
Wedding Chapel. yeah. Yeah.

1535
01:04:57.852 --> 01:04:59.729
<i>You know.
an Elvis impersonator</i>

1536
01:04:59.854 --> 01:05:00.772
<i>walking down the aisle.</i>

1537
01:05:00.855 --> 01:05:02.732
[humming]

1538
01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:04.234
It was fantastic.

1539
01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:08.154
It was just the greatest‐‐
the greatest thing ever.

1540
01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:12.492
<i>There was one evening
where my pills have kicked in.</i>

1541
01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:15.328
<i>and I'm out of it.</i>

1542
01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:17.455
‐ <i>Shawn was in
tremendous pain.</i>

1543
01:05:17.539 --> 01:05:19.958
<i>When he would take
the muscle relaxers.</i>

1544
01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:24.546
he would usually pass
out over his food.

1545
01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:27.006
<i>The very first time
that Shawn ever did that</i>

1546
01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:28.299
<i>was when we were
first married.</i>

1547
01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:30.009
<i>so it was a bit of a shock
to me.</i>

1548
01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:31.511
<i>So I got him in the shower.</i>

1549
01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:33.430
<i>'cause he had spilled food
all over his chest.</i>

1550
01:05:33.513 --> 01:05:38.017
and I would say it probably
happened a couple times a week.

1551
01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:40.937
‐ The worst time. again.

1552
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.815
was when she was
eight months pregnant

1553
01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:45.233
and she's doing
everything she can.

1554
01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:46.860
at eight months pregnant
with her belly.

1555
01:05:46.985 --> 01:05:49.779
trying to hold me up.

1556
01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:51.239
‐ <i>I took pity on him.</i>

1557
01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:53.491
<i>and I just prayed for him.
is all I could do.</i>

1558
01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.326
<i>But it didn't make me think.
you know.</i>

1559
01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:57.203
<i>"What in the world
have I gotten into?"</i>

1560
01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:00.206
If I was fearful. I was fearful
for our unborn child.

1561
01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:03.835
And I hoped that it would end
whenever the baby was born.

1562
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.254
and it didn't.

1563
01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:11.426
‐ <i>Here in Cleveland.
Ohio. we will make history.</i>

1564
01:06:11.509 --> 01:06:13.803
‐ <i>I don't remember
why Shawn was there.</i>

1565
01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:17.056
<i>He must have been some doing
something in the show.</i>

1566
01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:21.936
We all go. me. Taker.
Rock. Vince is in the ring.

1567
01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.688
<i>"Now I own WCW."</i>

1568
01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:28.318
Shawn is messed up. pilled up.

1569
01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:31.654
So this is
a celebratory moment.

1570
01:06:31.779 --> 01:06:36.367
He's belligerent. loud.
falling down. staggering.

1571
01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:42.040
Vince calls him in. tells him.
"Go home. I'm done with you."

1572
01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:44.501
Shawn goes ballistic.

1573
01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:47.962
Walks by me in the hallway.
just goes off.

1574
01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:51.007
‐ You know. I went

1575
01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:54.010
and browbeat Hunter
unfairly. obviously.

1576
01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:56.513
‐ And I just went off back.

1577
01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:59.849
you know. in his face.
screaming match back and forth.

1578
01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:01.267
and he storms out.

1579
01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:02.560
‐ Now that's another one
that makes me cry.

1580
01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:04.646
I went and said some
mean stuff to him

1581
01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:06.439
and walked out.

1582
01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:10.026
And. you know.

1583
01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:12.487
that sucks as well.

1584
01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:18.826
‐ And I don't talk to him
for a long time.

1585
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:22.080
‐ We didn't speak.
I don't know.

1586
01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:25.166
I mean I would think at least
a year. two years.

1587
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:28.586
It was. what do they call it.
the rock bottom.

1588
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:31.881
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

1589
01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:36.302
[indistinct chatter]

1590
01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:39.055
‐ <i>Our son was at the age
to where he was.</i>

1591
01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.641
<i>you know. walking around.
more aware of things.</i>

1592
01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:43.184
<i>and it was the night</i>

1593
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:45.019
<i>when Shawn had fallen asleep
on the couch‐‐</i>

1594
01:07:45.144 --> 01:07:46.145
<i>a drug‐induced sleep‐‐</i>

1595
01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:48.064
with our son
climbing all over him

1596
01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:49.566
and saying. "Daddy's asleep."

1597
01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.484
‐ To me.
the biggest thing again

1598
01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:54.153
was Cameron saying.
"Daddy's tired."

1599
01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:56.281
<i>And it sort of dawning on me</i>

1600
01:07:56.364 --> 01:07:59.075
<i>that he was now being able
to recognize</i>

1601
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.745
clearly my state of mind.

1602
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:05.373
<i>I went into the bathroom
and closed the door.</i>

1603
01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:07.166
<i>Looking at yourself
in the mirror</i>

1604
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:09.168
and. you know.

1605
01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:12.046
I sat there and cried
like a baby and wept.

1606
01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:15.008
you know.
realizing that you are failing.

1607
01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:17.260
you know.
a two‐year‐old little boy.

1608
01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:19.220
And all of those things

1609
01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:22.515
sort of came crashing down
that night.

1610
01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.060
and I just‐‐it's the first
time I ever feel

1611
01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:28.479
like such a frickin' failure.

1612
01:08:28.605 --> 01:08:30.106
And I think that that was
the last straw for him.

1613
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.817
and when he woke up
the next morning.

1614
01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:35.945
he told me he was never
taking pills or drinking again.

1615
01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:37.989
and from that point.
he didn't.

1616
01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:39.991
<i>It was an instantaneous
letting go</i>

1617
01:08:40.074 --> 01:08:41.534
<i>of the drugs and alcohol.</i>

1618
01:08:41.659 --> 01:08:43.369
‐ <i>I just called him
up out of the clear blue.</i>

1619
01:08:43.494 --> 01:08:46.539
I just asked him when the last
time he talked to Paul.

1620
01:08:46.664 --> 01:08:51.711
and. um. he just avoided
that situation.

1621
01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:56.924
I just said. "Man. you're wrong.
you got to call him."

1622
01:08:57.008 --> 01:08:58.593
I called Hunter
and let him know.

1623
01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:02.680
you know. how sorry I was
and how out of line I was.

1624
01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.807
And I said.
"I hope you can forgive me."

1625
01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:07.143
I needed that from Hunter.

1626
01:09:07.226 --> 01:09:09.479
For me. it was easy.
like. I didn't‐‐

1627
01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.981
as long as it
wasn't drugs talking to me.

1628
01:09:12.065 --> 01:09:13.650
‐ It's good to see you.

1629
01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:14.651
[patting]

1630
01:09:14.776 --> 01:09:15.652
‐ Group hug.

1631
01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:18.279
‐ <i>Of course.
I do regret the pain</i>

1632
01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:20.281
<i>that it caused people
in my life.</i>

1633
01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:23.076
but there is a part of that
that I don't think

1634
01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:27.288
that Michael Shawn Hickenbottom
can get

1635
01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:29.582
to where he got creatively

1636
01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:34.671
without a little bit of that
reckless. risky mindset.

1637
01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:38.758
I wouldn't have
had the guts to do it.

1638
01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:41.219
‐ <i>It was our
first Christmas together.</i>

1639
01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:43.429
and I gave Shawn a Bible
and some other books.

1640
01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:45.348
and he began reading them.

1641
01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:48.976
‐ <i>I had never had anything
that I could grasp</i>

1642
01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.312
<i>that was bigger
than the wrestling business.</i>

1643
01:09:51.396 --> 01:09:55.566
That's just not enough to base.
I don't know. a life on.

1644
01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:59.153
‐ <i>I worked at Cornerstone
Church in San Antonio. Texas.</i>

1645
01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:02.031
All of a sudden
I heard a deep voice said.

1646
01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:04.450
"I want to come
to a Bible study."

1647
01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:06.577
And then I got up from my desk

1648
01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:08.830
and stuck my head out the door.

1649
01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:10.748
and I said.
"Well. you can come to mine."

1650
01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:12.917
<i>When he left.
everybody came out and said.</i>

1651
01:10:12.959 --> 01:10:14.585
<i>"Do you know who that was?"</i>

1652
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:16.212
<i>I said. "No. I don't know
who that was. who was it?"</i>

1653
01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:17.630
And they said.
"Shawn Michaels."

1654
01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:19.674
and I said.
"Well. who's Shawn Michaels?"

1655
01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:23.553
<i>He said. "Well. first. Keith.</i>

1656
01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:26.305
<i>I want you to pray
for my back."</i>

1657
01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:28.057
He says.
"I've been out of wrestling

1658
01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:29.308
<i>and I want to go back."</i>

1659
01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:31.060
<i>I said. "Well.
there's a simple prayer</i>

1660
01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:32.478
<i>that we can pray together."</i>

1661
01:10:32.603 --> 01:10:34.981
<i>And while he was saying
that prayer.</i>

1662
01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:38.359
tears just come
out of his eyes.

1663
01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:40.486
‐ <i>I got nobody
to blame but me.</i>

1664
01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:43.489
<i>and I don't have anything
in common with the other dude.</i>

1665
01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:45.408
<i>and I don't know
how I got that way.</i>

1666
01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:48.244
It wasn't from family.
It wasn't from upbringing.

1667
01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:50.079
‐ He was so desperate

1668
01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:54.208
to get back in that close
relationship with Rebecca

1669
01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:55.918
<i>and his son.</i>

1670
01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:57.795
‐ <i>I was now a dad.
I was a husband.</i>

1671
01:10:57.837 --> 01:11:03.134
and I was really devoted
and thrilled about that.

1672
01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.469
‐ You're like a child.

1673
01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:07.346
you just want to tell
everybody. "I've been saved."

1674
01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:15.980
<i>‐ Once Shawn got
his life together</i>

1675
01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:18.232
<i>and found Christ.
it was night and day.</i>

1676
01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:19.692
<i>When he looks back
at his life.</i>

1677
01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:22.153
that's the biggest thing
that he ever did.

1678
01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:23.529
‐ <i>You were
dealing with the grownup</i>

1679
01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:24.906
<i>when Shawn came back.</i>

1680
01:11:25.031 --> 01:11:27.825
<i>someone who was there
to do business.</i>

1681
01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:31.162
Shawn was a lot calmer
and much easier to deal with.

1682
01:11:31.245 --> 01:11:32.830
‐ <i>Shawn Michaels of old</i>

1683
01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.582
<i>is very different from Shawn
Hickenbottom.</i>

1684
01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:35.917
<i>the man I married.</i>

1685
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.960
<i>The sexy boy
and all that kinda stuff.</i>

1686
01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:39.253
and his cocky attitude

1687
01:11:39.337 --> 01:11:41.130
and the cocky little smile
that he does.

1688
01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:45.301
That's so far
from who he really is.

1689
01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:47.011
‐ <i>I remember
somebody asking me.</i>

1690
01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:50.556
<i>they said. you know. "Hey.
I heard Shawn found religion."</i>

1691
01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.058
<i>Yeah. They laughed.</i>

1692
01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:56.979
and I said. "I don't anybody
that died OD'ing on religion."

1693
01:11:57.104 --> 01:11:58.648
‐ <i>He had called Triple H.</i>

1694
01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:01.818
<i>He thanked Hunter
for the time on the road</i>

1695
01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:04.695
because before his marriage
to me.

1696
01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:08.449
the one who took
care of him was Hunter.

1697
01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:10.993
That night. after Shawn
had gone to bed.

1698
01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:14.747
he woke up in the morning and
the pain was gone in his back.

1699
01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:16.749
<i>It was definitely a miracle.</i>

1700
01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.710
<i>So. he was physically ready
to go back in the ring.</i>

1701
01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:24.048
and I knew that the Lord
would take care of him.

1702
01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.716
‐ <i>We were kind of
having conversations</i>

1703
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.718
<i>at the time. and then he said.</i>

1704
01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:29.262
"I want my son to see me
do this one time."

1705
01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:30.805
he said. "But I don't know
that I can do it.

1706
01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.723
I don't know physically
if I can or not."

1707
01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:34.308
and he said. "If I'm going to.

1708
01:12:34.392 --> 01:12:37.436
I only trust one person.
that's you.

1709
01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.481
If you consider it.
I would love to do it.

1710
01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:44.402
What do you think?"

1711
01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:48.030
‐ <i>Moments away
from the non‐sanctioned fight</i>

1712
01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:51.659
between two men who were.
at one time. best friends.

1713
01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:53.786
Shawn Michaels and Triple H.

1714

<i>Shawn Michaels last wrestled
1.609 days ago.</i>

1716
01:13:02.169 --> 01:13:03.337
‐ <i>His whole family was there.</i>

1717
01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:06.048
<i>You know.
they were all scared to death.</i>

1718
01:13:06.173 --> 01:13:07.842
Got in the ring.

1720
01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.722
<i>Never missed a beat.
not a moment. not an anything.</i>

1721
01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:14.724
‐ I was on my chair
like a redneck.

1722
01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:16.517
just screaming
and yelling for him.

1723
01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:17.894
<i>Of course. I cried at the end.</i>

1724
01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:19.478
‐ <i>Like.
how is this possible.</i>

1725
01:13:19.604 --> 01:13:24.525
<i>that he is this good still.
after all that time</i>

1726
01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:28.821
and injury and everything else?
Unbelievable.

1727
01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:32.783
‐ <i>It was just as easy
as the day is long.</i>

1728
01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.660
it was poetic.
it was phenomenal.

1729
01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:38.205
it was everything that is right
and good about the world

1730
01:13:38.289 --> 01:13:41.334
in this line of work. and.

‐ <i>After the Summerslam.</i>

1734
01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:54.221
<i>that's when there was

<i>in the midst of doing

1736
01:13:56.933 --> 01:14:01.270
combining these two worlds
that I've never had together.

1737
01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:02.939
and I'm not even
the same person.

1738
01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:06.525
And now.
and it all feels so right.

1739
01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:07.735
That's as good as it gets.
you know.

1740
01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:10.488
it's heaven on Earth here
in this room.

1741
01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:12.990
‐ Shawn Michaels
changed completely

1742
01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.367
as a human being.

1743
01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:16.243
<i>And somehow. as a character.</i>

1744
01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:21.874
<i>he managed to keep a lot
of the aura that he always had.</i>

1745
01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:26.587
I could argue that Shawn was
at his best after he came back.

1746
01:14:26.671 --> 01:14:29.757
[cheers and applause]

1747
01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.634
‐ <i>To me.</i>

1748
01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:36.222
the greatest in‐ring performer

1749
01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:38.307
of all time.

1750
01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:41.560
<i>[soft music]</i>

1751
01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:43.729
‐ It gets more difficult

1752
01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:46.023
to find a new mountain.
a new challenge.

1753
01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.651
Sometimes that mountain
or that new challenge

1754
01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:49.860
just isn't there.

1755
01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:51.404
And so later on in my career.
I learned that

1756
01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:54.281
when I disconnect from it.
something will usually happen.

1757
01:14:54.365 --> 01:14:56.158
and. you know.
the one with Flair

1758
01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.328
is the one I honestly
always speak of.

1759
01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:01.914
Remember the story
of Old Yeller?

1760
01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:05.126
The Showstopper's gonna
take you. Old Yeller.

1762

It's like. oh my goodness.
he said. "Can you believe it?"

1766
01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:23.811
‐ It was overwhelming to think
that the guy that we idolized

1767
01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:27.606
that we would watch a little TV
box in San Antonio. Texas.

1768
01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:30.276
somehow their lives were going
to interconnect.

1769
01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:33.195
Ric was his guy.
He absolutely loved Ric Flair.

from New York to Orlando.</i>

1772

He gave everything
that anybody could ever give

1782
01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:10.232
to a match that night.

1783
01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:13.194

just doesn't have enough.

tear up talking about it.</i>

he thinks he still has it.

1791
01:16:30.211 --> 01:16:34.131
And that's when Shawn sort
of has to have that moment

1792
01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:36.634
where he says.
"I'm sorry. I love you."

1793

‐ <i>And just turns
the lights out.</i>

1795
01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:46.477
It was as beautiful and perfect
an ending to a wrestling match

1796

want to go.</i>
