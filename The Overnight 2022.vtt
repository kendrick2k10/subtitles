- What?

7
00:01:11.573 --> 00:01:14.747
You want me to wear my
communion dress?

8
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.580
I'm 18. You don't own me!

-I hate you!
-- Watch your mouth.
young lady!

00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:21.683
Just shut up!

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.819
- Well.
if you're not changing.
you're not going!

Oh David. look!
An antique store!

21
00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:02.845
-It looks cute!
Come on. let's go. please?
-No. no.

22
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.450
What about the reservations?
We're running late already.

23
00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:08.515
-The weather's getting bad.
-Are you serious?

24
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.322
-Come on.
-Okay.

25
00:04:11.357 --> 00:04:13.323
You're right.
Let's go antiquing.

26
00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:15.362
-Yay! I love you!

27
00:04:19.394 --> 00:04:20.933
You know what?

28
00:04:20.968 --> 00:04:22.903
This place is awesome.

29
00:04:22.938 --> 00:04:24.536
I knew it would be worth it.

30
00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.639
Oh wow.
This place is unbelievable.

31
00:04:31.674 --> 00:04:33.908
I've never seen
anything like this.

32
00:04:37.015 --> 00:04:38.346
Oh. hello.

33
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:39.817
You know where I'll be.

34
00:04:39.852 --> 00:04:40.680
Okay.

35
00:04:40.716 --> 00:04:42.619
-Have fun.

36
00:04:42.654 --> 00:04:44.957
I need to take some shots
for my blog anyways.

37
00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:46.855
-I'm behind.
-Sure.

38
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.758
-I'll be here when you're done.

39
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:25.184
-Oh God!
-Hey-- Hey Jessie.

40
00:06:27.127 --> 00:06:28.693
It is you. isn't it?

41
00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:30.724
I'm sorry. who are you?

42
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.560
Oh. I'm...
just one of your fans.

43
00:06:35.396 --> 00:06:36.668
Wow.

44
00:06:37.134 --> 00:06:39.236
Your...

45
00:06:39.272 --> 00:06:41.640
Your skin is so beautiful.

46
00:06:44.245 --> 00:06:46.546
You're even prettier in person.

47
00:06:50.416 --> 00:06:51.915
-You're--
-Oh. please.

48
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:54.180
-Don't touch me.
-It's cool. it's cool.
Sorry. sorry. sorry.

49
00:06:58.691 --> 00:07:03.057
I just... wanted to get a
picture with you?

50
00:07:04.063 --> 00:07:05.158
For my blog?

51
00:07:06.001 --> 00:07:08.133
-Oh. um...

52
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.702
Please?

53
00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:14.868
Yeah. sure.

54
00:07:14.903 --> 00:07:17.236
Cool. cool.
cool. cool. Come here.

55
00:07:37.098 --> 00:07:38.497
Hey. How's it going?

56
00:07:38.532 --> 00:07:40.497
Good. good. There's some
cool stuff in here.

57
00:07:40.532 --> 00:07:42.096
-Glad we stopped.

58
00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:44.032
Look at this.

59
00:07:46.674 --> 00:07:49.106
-It's sort of cute.

60
00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:50.277
What is it?

61
00:07:50.312 --> 00:07:53.012
I don't know.
Some 1920's creature.

62
00:07:53.047 --> 00:07:56.542
Can you believe someone thought
this was like a great gift
for a baby?

63
00:07:56.578 --> 00:08:00.920
Well. it sure
explains why my parents
are so dysfunctional.

64
00:08:00.956 --> 00:08:02.483
-Hmm.
-Oh!

65
00:08:02.518 --> 00:08:05.553
I think I'll take a pic
with this and send it out
to all my crazy fans.

66
00:08:07.593 --> 00:08:09.624
-You know what?

67
00:08:09.659 --> 00:08:11.126
I hate it when you do that.

68
00:08:11.161 --> 00:08:14.398
I don't like having my face
plastered all over the internet.

69
00:08:14.434 --> 00:08:16.002
Especially not with that thing.

70
00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:18.001
It's a toy. David.

71
00:08:18.037 --> 00:08:21.739
I mean. I'm posting it
as a part of my vacation
for my fans.

72
00:08:21.775 --> 00:08:24.575
Come on. after all.
you are the love of my life.

73
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.575
Yeah. well.
I love you too. baby.

74
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.549
But that thing is horrible!

75
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.244
-Let's hit the road. huh?
-Okay.

76
00:09:12.554 --> 00:09:13.825
You okay?

77
00:09:14.996 --> 00:09:16.288
I'm sorry.

78
00:09:16.323 --> 00:09:19.127
Hm? I didn't mean to
explode at you. I just...

79
00:09:19.902 --> 00:09:21.027
I just...

80
00:09:21.063 --> 00:09:23.604
I detest the whole
social media thing.

81
00:09:24.436 --> 00:09:25.837
And I hate selfies.

82
00:09:26.404 --> 00:09:27.740
That's not it.

83
00:09:28.275 --> 00:09:29.742
It's something else.

84
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:32.745
Well. what?

85
00:09:33.713 --> 00:09:36.647
There was this guy
at the antique mall.

86
00:09:36.682 --> 00:09:38.850
He came up behind me
and scared me.

87
00:09:40.418 --> 00:09:42.150
What the fuck?

88
00:09:44.052 --> 00:09:47.353
Said he recognized me.
was a fan.

89
00:09:47.388 --> 00:09:51.125
Just wanted a photo with me.
but he... touched me.

90
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.700
God. you know I hate when
strangers touch me.

91
00:09:55.003 --> 00:09:56.637
So. go on.

92
00:09:57.902 --> 00:10:01.373
Well. he took the photo
and just vanished.

93
00:10:01.408 --> 00:10:03.204
I mean. he just disappeared.

94
00:10:04.641 --> 00:10:06.273
Really creeped me out.

95
00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:11.146
You see. Jessie?

96
00:10:12.287 --> 00:10:14.017
That's what I'm talking about.

97
00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:19.057
If you post your
entire life on social media.

98
00:10:19.092 --> 00:10:21.921
I mean.
you have to expect
that you're gonna get

99
00:10:21.957 --> 00:10:24.356
some creepy guys following you.

100
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:28.135
Literally. doing
God know what
with your photo.

101
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.029
Oh. Jessie! Oh. my God!

102
00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:32.233
-God. you're such a jerk!
-Ow!

103
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.169
I'm sorry.

104
00:10:35.706 --> 00:10:38.107
You'll be okay.

105
00:11:09.805 --> 00:11:13.340
Where's the entrance to this
highway? It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

106
00:11:14.008 --> 00:11:15.980
I can see. it's right there!

107
00:11:20.382 --> 00:11:23.185
-Goddamnit!
This is not the highway!

108
00:11:26.223 --> 00:11:28.289
What? We're going
to be late for our reservation.

109
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:32.130
You know how funny
these B&B people can get.

110
00:11:32.166 --> 00:11:36.268
And you know what?
I don't wanna get stuck
in some cramped room.

111
00:11:36.303 --> 00:11:37.195
Can you call them?

112
00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:39.900
God! You know.
you need to chill.

113
00:11:39.936 --> 00:11:41.402
-Yeah.
-So what if we're late?

114
00:11:41.437 --> 00:11:44.908
-They charged my credit card
in advance anyways.
-Yeah.

115
00:11:44.943 --> 00:11:47.944
-You're right.
-I know! David. my favorite!

116
00:11:50.383 --> 00:11:51.879
Yeah. uh-huh.

117
00:11:51.914 --> 00:11:55.121
♪ Your hands on the wheel

118
00:11:55.157 --> 00:11:58.050

-- Oh. hell yeah!

122
00:12:22.917 --> 00:12:26.182
Oh! Got it! It's the tractor
on the yellow road sign!

123
00:12:26.817 --> 00:12:28.816
How are you so good at this?

124
00:12:28.851 --> 00:12:31.052
Okay. my turn. Hmm...

125
00:12:31.087 --> 00:12:34.052
-I'm gonna make this tough.
-Great.

126
00:12:34.088 --> 00:12:37.925
Okay. I spy something red.

127
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.935
Well. it better not be a cop
pulling us over. I'm driving
way over the speed limit.

128
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.367
-Oh. it's that barn over there?
-Oh. you are so cold.

129
00:12:47.408 --> 00:12:49.805
Um... Is it your car?

130
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.546
No. but you're getting warmer.

131
00:12:52.581 --> 00:12:55.915
-Here. I'll give you a hint.
-Okay.

132
00:12:57.383 --> 00:12:58.544
Take a peek.

133
00:13:01.882 --> 00:13:03.955
Oh. my God.

134
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.053
-Babe. stop doing that.

135
00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:08.428
Don't be such a grouch.

136
00:13:08.463 --> 00:13:10.095
-Jessie.

137
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.300
-What are you doing?
Would you stop doing that?
-What?

138
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.632
Oh. fuck! Shit!

139
00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:18.034
- My phone!

140
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:20.566
-Uh. we're gonna
have to pull over.
-Great.

141
00:13:30.012 --> 00:13:31.511
I don't fucking believe this.

142
00:13:33.148 --> 00:13:35.955
How the hell did this get here?

143
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:41.694
Jessie! What are you doing?

144
00:13:41.729 --> 00:13:45.057
My phone! It's ruined!
God. now what?

145
00:13:45.092 --> 00:13:46.761
Thank God.

146
00:13:46.797 --> 00:13:48.165
Wait. what is that?

147
00:13:52.237 --> 00:13:54.402
-Is that the thing from
the antique mall?
-Yeah.

148
00:13:55.736 --> 00:13:58.572
-Well. get it out of my tire!
-I don't want to touch it!

149
00:13:58.607 --> 00:14:01.178
I'll just leave it
stuck in there.
I'll put on the spare.

150
00:14:03.315 --> 00:14:06.579
Oh. David? I got a flat a while
back and I used the spare.

151
00:14:06.614 --> 00:14:10.286
-I guess I forgot about
getting a new one.
-Okay.

152
00:14:10.321 --> 00:14:12.792
Do you have roadside coverage?
You can use my phone?

153
00:14:12.828 --> 00:14:14.925
No. But if you get
this thing out of my tire.

154
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.424
we can drive
to a service station.

155
00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.266
Well. I don't know how far
we can get with a flat tire.

156
00:14:19.301 --> 00:14:23.398
It's fine. Just get it out of
my tire. all right?
I hate this area.

157
00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:45.321
Oh. I'm taking it.

158
00:14:46.289 --> 00:14:48.654
What?
I want to know
how it got there!

159
00:15:27.098 --> 00:15:29.200
This place is a ghost town.

160
00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:37.109
- Jess. I'm afraid
the axle is gonna break.

161
00:15:47.448 --> 00:15:50.551
Let's just park and find
a place to stay.

162
00:16:08.774 --> 00:16:10.907
Look at this building.

163
00:16:10.942 --> 00:16:12.738
It could be right out of France.

164
00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:14.908
You mean hotel.

165
00:16:14.943 --> 00:16:16.577
- Huh?

166
00:16:16.613 --> 00:16:19.652
This building that you're
drooling over instead of me?

167
00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.520
-Yeah?
-Yeah. it's a hotel.

168
00:16:21.556 --> 00:16:23.122
There's a sign. See?

169
00:16:23.956 --> 00:16:26.785
Well. let's get our overnights.

170
00:16:44.107 --> 00:16:45.945
It says use the back entrance.

171
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.581
I guess this place
is called Monroe Manor.

172
00:16:48.616 --> 00:16:51.117
Oh! Pretty and smart.

173
00:16:51.153 --> 00:16:53.282
Well. someone has to be the
brains behind this outfit.

174
00:16:53.317 --> 00:16:56.848
Well then. Einstein.
let's follow the arrows.

175
00:16:56.884 --> 00:16:59.519
I know you're pissed off but
this could be fun. right?

176
00:16:59.554 --> 00:17:02.788
A little adventure.
spontaneous. excitement.

177
00:17:03.995 --> 00:17:05.725
I'd rather be in Saratoga.

178
00:17:17.744 --> 00:17:19.242
-Norman!

179
00:17:19.278 --> 00:17:21.678
-Norman are you home?
-Okay. that's not funny.

180
00:17:24.584 --> 00:17:25.646
- Huh.

181
00:17:29.418 --> 00:17:32.518
-Jeez! Don't do that.

182
00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:34.521
God. this place gives
me the creeps.

183
00:17:34.556 --> 00:17:39.194
Yeah. but I like
the architecture in here.

184
00:17:39.229 --> 00:17:43.862
I'll have to ask about it and
take some photos before the
partners meeting next week.

185
00:17:44.637 --> 00:17:46.601
Yes. yes!

186
00:17:47.268 --> 00:17:49.668
This building is a gem.

187
00:17:49.704 --> 00:17:52.743
It was constructed
in 1898 as the City Hall.

188
00:17:52.778 --> 00:17:57.714
But then the owner's family
purchased it in 1982
and did renovations.

189
00:17:57.749 --> 00:17:59.012
But then...

190
00:17:59.048 --> 00:18:00.783
Plans changed.

191
00:18:00.819 --> 00:18:02.521
Things happened.

192
00:18:02.557 --> 00:18:03.549
But no worries!

193
00:18:03.584 --> 00:18:07.227
I am Salim.
Welcome to Monroe Manor.

194
00:18:07.262 --> 00:18:11.725
Well. hi. Salim.
I'm David Bradley.
and this is Jessie.

195
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.494
Now we're broken down
out the front with a flat tire.

196
00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:18.098
no spare. so we need
a place to stay.

197
00:18:18.133 --> 00:18:20.167
Flat and no spare.

198
00:18:20.202 --> 00:18:22.640
Hmm.

199
00:18:22.675 --> 00:18:27.378
Well. bad storm's
blowing in tonight.
Town is shutting up early.

200
00:18:27.414 --> 00:18:29.446
You're gonna have to deal
with that tomorrow morning.

201
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.284
Lucky for you.
I do have a vacancy
in one of our best suites.

202
00:18:34.319 --> 00:18:37.256
And our chef is serving
dinner until 9 P.M.

203
00:18:39.089 --> 00:18:42.026
Place seems pretty dead.

204
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:44.128
Oh. no. no. no. no.

205
00:18:44.163 --> 00:18:46.830
There are other
guests here. Jessie.

206
00:18:46.865 --> 00:18:50.036
It's just there have been
so many cancellations
due to the bad weather.

207
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:51.499
And as you can see.
we are short-staffed.

208
00:18:51.535 --> 00:18:55.274
But don't worry about
any of that. all right?

209
00:18:55.309 --> 00:18:58.540
Tonight. you and David will
have me at your service.

210
00:18:58.576 --> 00:19:03.475
So. all I need from you is.
if you could just...

211
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.414
...sign the guest register.

212
00:19:05.449 --> 00:19:07.717
Don't you just
swipe a card or something?

213
00:19:07.752 --> 00:19:08.714
Oh. no.

214
00:19:08.749 --> 00:19:10.883
We do things
the old fashioned way here.

215
00:19:10.918 --> 00:19:13.652
I just need your name.
an address and a phone number.

216
00:19:13.688 --> 00:19:15.756
and just a hundred dollars.
cash only.

217
00:19:15.791 --> 00:19:18.156
-Just to cover
the meal and drinks.

218
00:19:18.192 --> 00:19:21.059
Jeez. I don't even
know if I have 200 cash.
Baby. do you have any?

219
00:19:21.094 --> 00:19:23.468
-I know you were gonna
do some shopping.
-I guess so.

220
00:19:23.503 --> 00:19:27.539
No. I'm so sorry.
I mean a hundred dollars
for both of you.

221
00:19:27.575 --> 00:19:28.837
- Oh!

222
00:19:28.872 --> 00:19:29.902
Okay.

223
00:19:32.613 --> 00:19:33.609
- Ah.

224
00:19:40.282 --> 00:19:41.518
- Here you go.

225
00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:49.691
That seals the deal.

226
00:19:50.763 --> 00:19:51.963
Follow me.

227
00:19:51.998 --> 00:19:54.294
Let me show you to your room.

228
00:19:54.329 --> 00:19:59.269
Now. you best stick close to me
because Monroe Manor
has many twists and turns.

229
00:19:59.304 --> 00:20:02.569
It's easy to get lost
around here.

230
00:20:02.604 --> 00:20:04.272
It does seem
a little odd in here.

231
00:20:04.308 --> 00:20:07.046
but hey.
I love the architecture!

232
00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:09.345
It's his job.
He just made partner.

233
00:20:09.381 --> 00:20:12.450
Oh. congratulations!
That's great news.

234
00:20:13.251 --> 00:20:15.519
And how about you. Miss Jessie?

235
00:20:16.485 --> 00:20:18.720
Let me guess.
You're a model?

236
00:20:20.088 --> 00:20:21.225
Yeah.

237
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.493
Hey. so that's a relic.
Is it original?

238
00:20:23.528 --> 00:20:24.857
I see all the kids
are wearing them these days?

239
00:20:24.893 --> 00:20:28.196
Oh yes. this was a present
from Mr. Monroe himself.

240
00:20:28.231 --> 00:20:30.532
It keeps excellent time.

241
00:20:33.002 --> 00:20:34.267
Well...

242
00:20:34.303 --> 00:20:35.968
Our chariot awaits.

243
00:21:02.032 --> 00:21:03.303
Here we are.

244
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.207
I believe that you'll find
your stay here most rewarding.

245
00:21:12.242 --> 00:21:14.039
-Oh really?
-Mm-hmm.

246
00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:16.349
Aha! Here it is.

247
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.379
Room 409.

248
00:21:19.414 --> 00:21:21.886
Our most romantic suite.

249
00:21:24.625 --> 00:21:25.787
Wow.

250
00:21:25.822 --> 00:21:28.692
Oh yes. It has the most lovely
view of the courthouse.

251
00:21:28.728 --> 00:21:30.292
Oh!

252
00:21:30.327 --> 00:21:32.563
Babe. look at this building.

253
00:21:33.395 --> 00:21:35.566
Jessie. it's a classic.

254
00:21:35.602 --> 00:21:39.898
- Oh. yes. yes. yes.
everything here is vintage.

255
00:21:39.933 --> 00:21:42.936
Oh come on. babe.
Look at the bright side.

256
00:21:43.404 --> 00:21:45.105
You love antiques.

257
00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.308
I hope this place
doesn't have black mold.

258
00:21:50.343 --> 00:21:52.316
Mm-hmm.

259
00:21:52.351 --> 00:21:54.348
- Oh.
let me have your phone.

260
00:21:54.383 --> 00:21:58.119
I better call Saratoga and
let them know we'll be there by.
what? 11 tomorrow?

261
00:21:58.155 --> 00:21:59.755
Yeah. good idea.

262
00:22:04.291 --> 00:22:07.263
<i>We're sorry.</i>
<i>all circuits are busy now.</i>

263
00:22:07.298 --> 00:22:10.367
All circuits are busy? What?

264
00:22:10.402 --> 00:22:13.303
I don't know.
maybe the weather's bad?

265
00:22:13.339 --> 00:22:15.101
Looks like there's
a storm brewing.

266
00:22:15.136 --> 00:22:19.103
Do feel free to stop by
the lobby before
you go to dinner.

267
00:22:19.139 --> 00:22:22.877
The restaurant can be
rather difficult to find.

268
00:22:24.784 --> 00:22:25.949
Okay.

269
00:22:25.985 --> 00:22:27.585
Thanks. Salim.

270
00:23:03.484 --> 00:23:04.886
- Babe?

271
00:23:04.922 --> 00:23:08.461
Can you bring me my shampoo?
I forgot it on the table.

272
00:23:17.398 --> 00:23:18.603
Found it!

273
00:23:28.144 --> 00:23:29.375
Um...

274
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:30.846
It's locked.

275
00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:34.113
No. I left the door unlocked.

276
00:23:34.856 --> 00:23:36.350
What's going on?

277
00:23:36.385 --> 00:23:40.085
-Well. I don't know
what to tell you. it's locked.
-What's going on?

278
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:42.858
David. what's going on?
Seriously. Open the door!

279
00:23:42.893 --> 00:23:46.230
Babe. just hold on for a second.
It might be jammed.

280
00:23:46.265 --> 00:23:48.127
David. open the fucking door!

281
00:23:52.971 --> 00:23:53.899
Ow!

282
00:23:53.935 --> 00:23:55.439
This better not be
one of your tricks.

283
00:23:55.474 --> 00:23:57.376
-David Bradley.
-No no! It wasn't me!

284
00:23:57.411 --> 00:23:59.078
You know I hate
being locked in anywhere.

285
00:23:59.113 --> 00:24:01.140
The door was jammed. I told you.

286
00:24:04.986 --> 00:24:06.211
I got your shampoo.

287
00:24:07.019 --> 00:24:08.081
- Hmm?

288
00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:10.248
Oh.

289
00:24:13.893 --> 00:24:14.926
Oh.

290
00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.327
- Oh.

291
00:24:18.362 --> 00:24:20.462
Hey. I've got an idea.

292
00:24:20.497 --> 00:24:23.602
How about I shampoo your hair?

293
00:25:26.694 --> 00:25:28.860
-- David?
-Hm?

294
00:25:28.895 --> 00:25:31.230
-Could you zip me up?
-Oh.

295
00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:33.001
With pleasure.

296
00:25:39.777 --> 00:25:42.311
-Come on. It's a mistake.

297
00:25:42.346 --> 00:25:44.012
You smell so good.

298
00:25:49.818 --> 00:25:52.350
Hmm. you look stunning tonight.

299
00:26:01.234 --> 00:26:02.866
Just wait till tonight.

300
00:26:54.388 --> 00:26:56.519
-Oh! Cheeky thing.

301
00:26:56.555 --> 00:26:59.257
-Oh. He's cute.

302
00:26:59.292 --> 00:27:01.259
This guy? Leroy Barnes?

303
00:27:03.291 --> 00:27:05.657
-- He's a lucky guy.

304
00:27:05.692 --> 00:27:07.599
One with me.

305
00:27:10.166 --> 00:27:12.335
-You don't even have service.
-Your camera works.

306
00:27:12.371 --> 00:27:13.439
I'll post it later.

307
00:27:13.474 --> 00:27:14.470
-I bet you will.

308
00:27:28.349 --> 00:27:31.423
Gotta get this chapter done.

309
00:27:31.459 --> 00:27:34.353
Oh. I need coffee.

310
00:27:39.431 --> 00:27:41.325
Fresh coffee.

311
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.967
Oh. I gotta get this
chapter done tonight.

312
00:27:46.372 --> 00:27:47.404
-Oh!

313
00:27:49.573 --> 00:27:51.474
I've been expecting you.

314
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.746
Come. We should get going.

315
00:27:53.781 --> 00:27:56.644
Chef Linda closes the kitchen
promptly at 9 O'clock.

316
00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.113
Yeah. You mentioned that.

317
00:28:01.823 --> 00:28:05.418
I imagine this was
once quite a uh.
a grand City Hall.

318
00:28:05.454 --> 00:28:08.660
and I guess the Monroe family
was very fortunate to obtain it.

319
00:28:08.696 --> 00:28:11.189
Oh. yes. yes.
They're a very wealthy family.

320
00:28:11.224 --> 00:28:13.665
They did their
best renovations here.

321
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.295
Interesting. Oh. actually.
that reminds me.

322
00:28:16.331 --> 00:28:19.070
today we had a bit
of an incident in the bathroom.

323
00:28:19.106 --> 00:28:23.574
See. the door got jammed.
and uh. well.
Jessie got locked in.

324
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.804
Oh. Oh. I'm--
I'm sorry. I'm...

325
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.374
I'm so sorry.

326
00:28:28.942 --> 00:28:31.215
I will tell Mr. Monroe.

327
00:28:31.251 --> 00:28:32.845
Well. thank you.

328
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.783
Yeah. Jessie normally never
locks the door. so it was
a little upsetting.

329
00:28:36.818 --> 00:28:38.153
If you know what I mean.

330
00:28:39.423 --> 00:28:40.952
No worries.

331
00:28:40.987 --> 00:28:44.123
Old doorways and locks.

332
00:28:44.159 --> 00:28:48.460
they tend to act out
when it gets damp.

333
00:28:50.165 --> 00:28:53.165
Oh. it's okay. Salim.
We worked it out.

334
00:28:53.201 --> 00:28:54.836
-- Hey Salim. wait up.
-- One.

335
00:28:54.872 --> 00:28:56.704
-- I have a question.
-Two.

336
00:28:56.739 --> 00:28:59.504
Three. four. five. six.

337
00:29:06.715 --> 00:29:08.216
Hot date. Salim?

338
00:29:08.651 --> 00:29:10.923
No. Not exactly.

339
00:29:10.958 --> 00:29:13.859
I just have to tend
to another visitor.
But please.

340
00:29:14.227 --> 00:29:15.322
Take a seat.

341
00:29:17.961 --> 00:29:20.294
-- Thank you.

342
00:29:22.597 --> 00:29:23.836
Well...

343
00:29:24.738 --> 00:29:26.872
Chef Linda will be
down in just a moment.

344
00:29:27.306 --> 00:29:28.302
Thank you.

345
00:29:33.613 --> 00:29:36.309
-I think he...

346
00:29:36.345 --> 00:29:39.879
What's with the plastic watch?
It's so annoying!

347
00:29:39.914 --> 00:29:41.920
I know. He's an odd one.

348
00:29:43.824 --> 00:29:46.122
Did I mention how beautiful
you look tonight?

349
00:29:59.834 --> 00:30:01.038
- Good time.

350
00:30:28.466 --> 00:30:31.232
So. this guy continues
to tell me for. like.
an hour about how

351
00:30:31.267 --> 00:30:33.873
Frank Lloyd Wright
is the greatest of all time.

352
00:30:36.071 --> 00:30:40.077
I said. " How could you say
that if you've never been
to Barcelona to see Galvany?"

353
00:30:41.273 --> 00:30:43.507
Good evening. I'm Chef Linda.

354
00:30:43.543 --> 00:30:46.114
Tonight's menu is prime rib and
baked potato.

355
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:49.114
and pineapple upside down cake
for dessert.

356
00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:51.924
Oh. um. No. I'm a vegetarian.

357
00:30:55.892 --> 00:30:58.126
David! She just ignored me.

358
00:30:58.161 --> 00:31:00.460
I mean. I have barely eaten
anything today.

359
00:31:01.195 --> 00:31:03.199
I mean. I'm sure she heard you.

360
00:31:03.933 --> 00:31:06.301
It's okay. You won't starve.

361
00:31:07.474 --> 00:31:09.269
Are you saying I'm fat?

362
00:31:09.304 --> 00:31:11.202
You know I have to look good
for my blog.

363
00:31:11.237 --> 00:31:15.879
No. I'm just saying that
I'm sure she heard you and that
she'll bring you some food.

364
00:31:15.915 --> 00:31:19.714
So relax.
and enjoy this lovely room.

365
00:31:24.984 --> 00:31:26.926
Mmm. baby.

366
00:31:28.796 --> 00:31:32.129
It looks like you
have another admirer.

367
00:31:35.635 --> 00:31:37.928
God. David. don't be gross.

368
00:31:37.964 --> 00:31:42.136
Well. that's what you get
when you put yourself
on social media.

369
00:31:42.171 --> 00:31:44.339
Well.
you have a better suggestions?

370
00:31:45.372 --> 00:31:48.211
Yeah.
I could think of a few things.

371
00:31:52.849 --> 00:31:55.251
Yeah. I'd share wine--

372
00:31:57.484 --> 00:32:00.955
-Compliments of the house.
-Ahh! Thank you!

373
00:32:31.819 --> 00:32:33.025
Enjoy.

374
00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:40.492
With my deepest apologies
for being understaffed
this evening.

375
00:32:40.527 --> 00:32:43.332
and for that mishap
with the bathroom door.

376
00:32:44.933 --> 00:32:46.835
Eugene Monroe.

377
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:48.403
Welcome to Monroe Manor.

Yeah. thanks.

379

We love this place.

380
00:33:00.815 --> 00:33:02.021
Well.

381
00:33:02.456 --> 00:33:04.182

382
00:33:17.229 --> 00:33:18.970
Father Betancourt.

383
00:33:19.005 --> 00:33:21.434
Thanks for taking care
of our little lady.

♪ Whispering in my ear ♪

385
00:33:43.297 --> 00:33:44.294
Not bad.

386
00:34:15.528 --> 00:34:16.788
Ow! Damn!

387
00:34:30.941 --> 00:34:32.540
God. this place sucks.

388
00:34:34.142 --> 00:34:35.477
It's just one night.

389
00:34:36.548 --> 00:34:37.881
Hey.

390
00:34:37.916 --> 00:34:39.415
I can share my steak with you.

391
00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:41.918
-Oh. God. No. no. no.
-- Just a little steak-ie?

392
00:34:41.953 --> 00:34:44.123
-- No?
-- Stop.

393
00:34:51.764 --> 00:34:53.094
- One. two. three.

394
00:35:02.706 --> 00:35:04.036
Three.

395
00:35:04.072 --> 00:35:06.343
One. two. three.

396
00:35:08.011 --> 00:35:12.148
Two. three. four. five.

397
00:35:12.184 --> 00:35:14.918
-Hey. you cheated!
-No. you're a liar!

398
00:35:14.953 --> 00:35:16.848
I saw you cheat! I hate you!

399
00:35:37.975 --> 00:35:39.673
God damn it. Linda!

400
00:35:45.148 --> 00:35:47.483
You forgot to serve dessert.

401
00:35:59.532 --> 00:36:01.063
Wait.

402
00:36:01.098 --> 00:36:02.828
Something's terribly off here.

403
00:36:04.001 --> 00:36:05.534
All the loops are off.

404
00:36:21.885 --> 00:36:23.315
Yummy time.

405
00:36:23.351 --> 00:36:25.785
I am sorry for the delay.

406
00:36:27.054 --> 00:36:31.389
Chef Linda. she always closes
the kitchen promptly at 9 p.m.

407
00:36:31.424 --> 00:36:33.164
Oh. where is the chef?

408
00:36:33.199 --> 00:36:35.226
I want to thank her
for my baked potato.

409
00:36:35.261 --> 00:36:36.466
- Jess!

410
00:36:38.869 --> 00:36:39.964
I'm sorry.

411
00:36:43.574 --> 00:36:46.708
-It has been such great service.
-- I know. right?

412
00:36:46.743 --> 00:36:49.908
You know what? Fuck it.
I'm not counting
calories tonight.

413
00:36:50.843 --> 00:36:53.282
Perhaps I can interest you
in some port.

414
00:36:53.317 --> 00:36:54.846
Would you be interested
in some port?

415
00:36:54.881 --> 00:36:58.851
We have some 1980s
vintage port from Portugal.

416
00:37:00.727 --> 00:37:02.888
Oh! More vintage.

417
00:37:04.429 --> 00:37:06.896
Thank-- thank-- thank you.
Salim. This is...

418
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:08.025
This is delicious.

419
00:37:08.998 --> 00:37:09.994
Thank you.

420
00:37:11.463 --> 00:37:12.804
Have a good night.

421
00:37:14.871 --> 00:37:15.868
Cheers.

422
00:37:20.373 --> 00:37:22.047
Jess. come on.

423
00:37:22.082 --> 00:37:24.248
We'll have more fun tomorrow.
hmm?

424
00:37:24.283 --> 00:37:27.586
How about we. uh.
take some photos. eh?

425
00:37:27.621 --> 00:37:30.850
-Show you fans
how much fun you're having?

426
00:37:33.822 --> 00:37:37.329
The only good thing
about this place is the booze.

427
00:37:38.897 --> 00:37:40.299
You know what?

428
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.467
This tastes pretty good.

429
00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:45.766
Try some.

430
00:37:48.036 --> 00:37:49.033
Come on.

431
00:37:51.206 --> 00:37:52.806
-Hmm.
-Mmm.

432
00:37:53.306 --> 00:37:54.472
Delicious.

433
00:37:56.817 --> 00:38:00.348
Oh. Vintage lights too?

434
00:38:00.383 --> 00:38:02.719
-- How charming.
-Now what?

435
00:38:02.755 --> 00:38:04.089
No power?

436
00:38:04.124 --> 00:38:07.488
Oh. come one. David.
It's romantic.

437
00:38:07.523 --> 00:38:10.323
Did you plan this all
for a reason?

438
00:38:10.358 --> 00:38:12.793
Huh? No. No. This sucks.

439
00:38:18.732 --> 00:38:20.966
He must not have stayed
for dessert.

440
00:38:21.939 --> 00:38:23.941
What? Who?

441
00:38:23.976 --> 00:38:25.575
The cowboy and his pony.

442
00:38:27.145 --> 00:38:29.711
God. you're so disgusting.

443
00:38:29.979 --> 00:38:30.976
Hey.

444
00:38:31.878 --> 00:38:34.650
I'm sorry I dragged you here.
I mean...

445
00:38:35.615 --> 00:38:37.389
you deserve better than this.

446
00:38:39.392 --> 00:38:41.888
David. I know I'm being a bitch.
but I just...

447
00:38:42.754 --> 00:38:45.661
you know what look. I'm sorry.

448
00:38:45.697 --> 00:38:48.733
I know you're trying to make
the best of the situation.

449
00:38:48.769 --> 00:38:49.896
That's my girl.

450
00:38:55.635 --> 00:38:59.376
I am sorry to break the mood.

451
00:38:59.411 --> 00:39:01.677
but we have the elevator running
right now.

452
00:39:01.712 --> 00:39:04.248
But I don't know how long
the generator will last.

453
00:39:04.283 --> 00:39:05.945
so I'll have to ask you
to follow me.

454
00:39:07.786 --> 00:39:08.612
Now.

455
00:39:33.209 --> 00:39:35.579
Oh. my God. David!

456
00:39:36.111 --> 00:39:37.645
Hurry.

457
00:39:37.681 --> 00:39:40.848
-- The kids! They're dead!
-Hey. hey. What?

458
00:39:43.319 --> 00:39:44.787
- What's wrong?

459
00:39:44.822 --> 00:39:46.150
- Miss. Jessie. please.
calm down. There's nobody here.

460
00:39:46.185 --> 00:39:48.153
My children went to bed
when you were having dinner.

461
00:39:48.188 --> 00:39:50.924
Yeah. Salim's right.
There's no one in there.
It's okay.

462
00:39:51.991 --> 00:39:54.725
- Your kids are here?
Isn't it late?

463
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.529
Yes. well. we've lived here...

464
00:39:57.565 --> 00:39:59.564
since my wife passed away.

465
00:40:01.534 --> 00:40:02.903
I'm so sorry.

466
00:40:04.671 --> 00:40:06.506
- Too much port. huh?

467
00:40:06.542 --> 00:40:09.041
No. no. I saw them. I saw them.

468
00:40:10.449 --> 00:40:11.878
- I think she just needs
some sleep.

469
00:40:11.913 --> 00:40:15.520
Yes. we must hurry.
We must hurry. Come. come.

470
00:40:18.853 --> 00:40:20.888
-- Grab her bag.
-- Yes. yes.

471
00:40:30.298 --> 00:40:31.503
Go to sleep.

472
00:41:41.039 --> 00:41:44.237
-- I'm not going to the prom
dressed like a--

473
00:41:44.272 --> 00:41:46.772
-- <i> I hate you!</i>
-- <i> Watch you mouth.</i>
<i>young lady.</i>

474
00:41:46.807 --> 00:41:49.276
-- No! No!

475
00:41:52.046 --> 00:41:56.383
Oh. um.
I'm sorry to disturb you. sir.
but...

476
00:41:56.418 --> 00:41:58.049
We have a problem.

477
00:41:58.084 --> 00:42:00.856
-All the loops are off.
-That's your fault.

478
00:42:01.491 --> 00:42:03.694
I told you just the girl.

479
00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:07.729
But...
I thought you said you wanted
both of them.

480
00:42:07.765 --> 00:42:10.729
-Eugene. what about my children?
-It's too late.

481
00:42:10.764 --> 00:42:13.331
You have empowered the demon.

482
00:42:13.366 --> 00:42:16.668
Now. we've got to work fast
before all hell breaks loose.

483
00:42:26.283 --> 00:42:27.751
What have I done?

484
00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:48.937
Jessie?

485
00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.631
Gotta get this done.
Gotta get this done.

486
00:43:16.995 --> 00:43:19.302
Gotta get this chapter done.

487
00:43:23.373 --> 00:43:25.006
I need coffee.

488
00:45:10.679 --> 00:45:12.278
I'll see you in hell.

489
00:45:41.711 --> 00:45:44.046
What the fuck? Ahhh. God!

490
00:45:45.616 --> 00:45:48.449
What the fuck? What is this?

491
00:45:48.485 --> 00:45:49.747
Get the fuck--

492
00:45:49.783 --> 00:45:51.350
Get the fuck--

493
00:45:53.158 --> 00:45:54.287
Jessie!

494
00:45:55.061 --> 00:45:56.058
Jessie.

495
00:45:56.326 --> 00:45:57.424
Fuck.

496
00:45:57.459 --> 00:45:58.489
Jessie!

497
00:46:00.463 --> 00:46:02.229
Oh. my God!

498
00:46:02.563 --> 00:46:03.726
Fuck!

499
00:46:03.762 --> 00:46:04.968
Oh!

500
00:46:05.999 --> 00:46:07.498
Baby. we gotta get outta here.

501
00:46:08.804 --> 00:46:10.974
I'm serious. We have to leave.

502
00:46:11.506 --> 00:46:12.503
Now.

503
00:46:14.608 --> 00:46:15.643
Jessie?

504
00:46:20.479 --> 00:46:23.855
Jessie?
I'm serious. we have to go.
Baby?

505
00:46:25.256 --> 00:46:26.291
Fuck.

506
00:46:37.763 --> 00:46:38.969
Baby?

507
00:46:39.633 --> 00:46:40.839
Wake up!

508
00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.137
Jess!

509
00:46:44.073 --> 00:46:46.075
All right.
I'll be back in a minute. okay?

510
00:46:48.206 --> 00:46:50.013
-Oh. fuck!

511
00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.213
God! Jess!

512
00:46:55.814 --> 00:46:57.113
Okay.

513
00:46:57.149 --> 00:46:58.785
What the hell is going on?

514
00:47:02.722 --> 00:47:03.928
Salim?

515
00:47:09.795 --> 00:47:11.034
Salim!

516
00:47:12.732 --> 00:47:13.971
Salim!

517
00:47:15.805 --> 00:47:18.442
Salim. We got a problem here!

518
00:47:23.411 --> 00:47:27.083
Hey! Your showers are spitting
out black shit. man!

519
00:47:28.682 --> 00:47:29.888
Salim?

520
00:47:31.885 --> 00:47:33.452
What the fuck?

521
00:47:38.296 --> 00:47:39.156
Salim?

522
00:47:47.569 --> 00:47:49.474
Oh. God!

523
00:47:55.447 --> 00:47:57.047
You... you okay?

524
00:47:59.152 --> 00:48:00.149
Fuck.

525
00:48:02.749 --> 00:48:03.955
Salim!

526
00:48:05.554 --> 00:48:06.854
Fuck!

527
00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:28.507
Oh. God. Oh. God.

528
00:48:29.779 --> 00:48:31.879
Hey. Hey old man. um.

529
00:48:31.914 --> 00:48:33.950
have you seen Salim around?

530
00:48:33.986 --> 00:48:38.388
Because uh. uh. Linda.
Linda the Chef. um...

531
00:48:38.424 --> 00:48:42.558
I was just in the kitchen
and she was lying
on the ground. and...

532
00:48:42.593 --> 00:48:44.424
she-- she's dead!

533
00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.230
You hear what I'm saying?
She's fucking dead!

534
00:48:55.408 --> 00:48:56.403
All right. well...

535
00:48:57.405 --> 00:49:00.242
I don't normally drink
this stuff. but I'm...

536
00:49:00.777 --> 00:49:02.272
I'll be honest with you.

537
00:49:02.307 --> 00:49:04.312
I'm having a bit of a bad night.

538
00:49:09.351 --> 00:49:13.324
I mean. my fiance.
she's all pissed off at me.

539
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.328
There's this... this black goo
that keeps shooting out
of the shower.

540
00:49:17.364 --> 00:49:20.725
I mean what the fuck
is the deal with all
the black goo around here?

541
00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.694
Were you listening
when I told you
that the chef is dead?

542
00:49:25.505 --> 00:49:26.499
- I'm listenin'.

543
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.437
Take care of your little lady.

544
00:49:37.877 --> 00:49:39.083
Jesus.

545
00:49:40.445 --> 00:49:42.350
No thanks for your help. buddy.

546
00:49:44.653 --> 00:49:48.587
I guess you stay here
long enough.
you become an alcoholic.

547
00:49:49.958 --> 00:49:51.656
-Salim?

548
00:49:52.928 --> 00:49:54.428
Salim. is that you?

549
00:49:56.197 --> 00:49:59.169
Fuck you. Salim. Just fuck you!

550
00:50:09.277 --> 00:50:12.083
Damn!
Nothing in this place works!

551
00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:49.549
David! Salim!

552
00:50:50.183 --> 00:50:52.090
Open the damn door!

553
00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:03.497
Shit.

554
00:51:14.814 --> 00:51:16.873
Thank you. Thank you very much.

555
00:51:18.078 --> 00:51:19.315
Soon as I saw it.

556
00:51:20.149 --> 00:51:22.153
I knew she was something
special.

557
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:47.442
I didn't expect to see you here.

558
00:51:50.012 --> 00:51:51.178
How can I help you?

559
00:51:51.214 --> 00:51:54.080
Who was that?
He gave you money?

560
00:51:54.115 --> 00:51:58.289
It was a-- a tow truck driver
that I-- I-- I hired to get rid
of the evidence.

561
00:51:58.324 --> 00:52:01.324
-He called me earlier.
-Really?
Why did you sell the car?

562
00:52:02.392 --> 00:52:05.394
Well. I thought that if we were
using the owners

563
00:52:05.429 --> 00:52:09.193
to help get my children's souls
back. then we could--

564
00:52:09.228 --> 00:52:10.861
Give me the cash.

565
00:52:13.905 --> 00:52:15.899
We've got bigger problems. Look.

566
00:52:17.235 --> 00:52:18.842
- What?

567
00:52:18.877 --> 00:52:20.205
How is this possible? Wait.

568
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.312
Wait. Let me rewind it.

569
00:52:24.882 --> 00:52:28.411
- I locked David
and Jessie in their room.
We'll deal with them later.

570
00:52:37.289 --> 00:52:39.261
- <i> Salim?</i>

571
00:52:39.296 --> 00:52:41.665
-He's out.
-- <i> Salim. is that you?</i>

572
00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.731
That's impossible.

573
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:45.566
Humming?

574
00:52:47.639 --> 00:52:48.635
Find him.

575
00:52:49.434 --> 00:52:50.673
I'm getting Jessie.

576
00:53:05.658 --> 00:53:06.653
- Salim?

577
00:53:08.792 --> 00:53:09.887
Is that you?

578
00:53:19.266 --> 00:53:20.469
- Who are you?

579
00:53:32.146 --> 00:53:33.245
Are you okay?

580
00:53:43.192 --> 00:53:45.824
Come play with us. David.

581
00:53:56.667 --> 00:54:00.043
-Who's that?
-Just me. Rohan.

582
00:54:00.079 --> 00:54:02.443
-Salim's dead son.
-- And me.

583
00:54:02.479 --> 00:54:05.849
Dev. Don't you wanna come
and play with us?

584
00:54:05.884 --> 00:54:07.945
Emma likes to play too.

585
00:54:11.249 --> 00:54:12.521
David.

586
00:54:18.996 --> 00:54:20.993
Thank God you're here!

587
00:54:21.028 --> 00:54:23.294
David's missing
and there's black shit
all over the bathroom.

588
00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:27.503
Now. now. Miss Jessie.
This is an old hotel.
we don't get many guests.

589
00:54:28.501 --> 00:54:30.569
That's just rust from old pipes.

590
00:54:30.605 --> 00:54:33.038
Yeah. no.
rust is not black and gross!

591
00:54:33.073 --> 00:54:37.514
Don't be worried. all right?
Why don't you and I look
for David.

592
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:40.217
I have a flashlight.
The halls are dim
from the storm.

593
00:54:40.252 --> 00:54:42.416
-- <i> Help!</i>
-Wait. did you hear that?

594
00:54:42.451 --> 00:54:44.520
That's David!
Come on we have to go!

595
00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.590
- Help me.

596
00:54:49.056 --> 00:54:51.087
Help me.

597
00:54:52.158 --> 00:54:53.191
Help.

598
00:54:53.227 --> 00:54:55.399
She killed us.

599
00:54:55.966 --> 00:54:56.961
- Jessie!

600
00:54:58.329 --> 00:54:59.364
Jess.

601
00:55:02.038 --> 00:55:05.673
Help! Help! Help!

602
00:55:06.975 --> 00:55:08.071
Help!

603
00:55:14.246 --> 00:55:15.279
Jessie!

604
00:55:18.989 --> 00:55:19.984
- Jessie!

605
00:55:20.586 --> 00:55:22.624
Jessie. I really need you!

606
00:55:33.936 --> 00:55:34.972
Help me.

607
00:56:31.758 --> 00:56:33.629
Shit.
I don't have the time for this.

608
00:56:43.271 --> 00:56:45.173
Come on. Salim.

609
00:56:45.209 --> 00:56:47.071
Answer the God damn phone!

610
00:56:53.645 --> 00:56:54.848
Where the fuck are you?

611
00:56:57.954 --> 00:56:59.287
Uh...

612
00:57:06.831 --> 00:57:07.828
Come on.

613
00:57:11.501 --> 00:57:15.432
No. No. no! No. Thomas.
don't do that!

614
00:57:30.285 --> 00:57:32.054
I need coffee.

615
00:57:32.089 --> 00:57:33.249
What is going on?

616
00:58:01.315 --> 00:58:02.520
- Hmm.

617
00:58:08.322 --> 00:58:09.527
- Hmm.

618
00:58:11.497 --> 00:58:13.426
-- Hmm.
All right. take it easy.

619
00:58:29.377 --> 00:58:30.746
- Ah. okay.

620
00:58:31.817 --> 00:58:32.814
Okay.

621
00:58:33.578 --> 00:58:34.783
All right.

622
01:00:33.969 --> 01:00:38.676
You must smell it.
It's magical. It's pachouli.

623
01:00:40.046 --> 01:00:41.041
It's magical.

624
01:00:52.091 --> 01:00:53.152
Oh. hey Salim!

625
01:01:00.763 --> 01:01:03.066
What the fuck is going on here.
man?

626
01:01:03.102 --> 01:01:06.863
You see me covered
in this black goo
from your lousy showers? Huh?

627
01:01:06.899 --> 01:01:09.002
Or what about Chef Linda?

628
01:01:09.038 --> 01:01:11.538
She's dead! Up in the kitchen!
Did you know that?

629
01:01:11.573 --> 01:01:13.008
Or what about Thomas?

630
01:01:13.043 --> 01:01:15.476
Thomas. the guy that likes
to hang himself in front of me!

631
01:01:15.511 --> 01:01:17.280
-Hands up. chap.
-Whoa.

632
01:01:17.316 --> 01:01:18.614
I owe you no explanation.

633
01:01:18.649 --> 01:01:20.718
-Okay.
-You signed the guest register.

634
01:01:21.318 --> 01:01:22.313
What the fuck?

635
01:01:24.287 --> 01:01:25.617
Here ya go.

636
01:01:25.653 --> 01:01:26.988
That seals the deal.

637
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.057
No.

638
01:01:32.296 --> 01:01:33.561
You're crazy.

639
01:01:33.596 --> 01:01:35.364
Aren't we all a little insane?

640
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:10.463
I wanna fix your hair.

641
01:02:10.499 --> 01:02:12.165
Don't touch me!

642
01:02:12.765 --> 01:02:13.969
Where's David?

643
01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:16.503
David! Help!

644
01:02:16.538 --> 01:02:19.502
Help me! Help me!

645
01:02:20.408 --> 01:02:21.440
David?

646
01:02:21.475 --> 01:02:22.841
David?

647
01:02:22.876 --> 01:02:25.310
David?
Oh. he's not here!

648
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.918
You won't be seeing
David anymore.

649
01:02:53.278 --> 01:02:55.813
What now? Salim!

650
01:03:15.529 --> 01:03:16.526
Jessie?

651
01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:24.171
Baby. Baby. we...

652
01:03:26.711 --> 01:03:29.506
We gotta get outta here.
Baby. Wake up!

653
01:03:30.815 --> 01:03:33.345
We have to get out of here.
You hear me?

654
01:03:39.258 --> 01:03:42.825
Hey. I love you.

655
01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:45.060
And I know this trip
hasn't gone to plan.

656
01:03:46.062 --> 01:03:48.327
But I promise I'll make it up
to you. okay?

657
01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.397
Baby?

658
01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.237
Jessie?

659
01:04:02.281 --> 01:04:04.046
What the fuck?

660
01:04:07.814 --> 01:04:10.613
What the fuck?

661
01:04:12.887 --> 01:04:14.617
Jessie. weren't you just--

662
01:04:17.427 --> 01:04:19.723
Jess! Fuck!

663
01:04:30.034 --> 01:04:31.403
I'm sorry. Thomas.

664
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:33.570
You're on your own now.

665
01:04:53.928 --> 01:04:56.397
What the hell are you wearing?

666
01:04:56.432 --> 01:04:57.429
What?

667
01:04:59.004 --> 01:05:01.168
You're not going to the prom
dressed like a tramp?

668
01:05:01.204 --> 01:05:05.434
What? Do you want me
to wear my communion dress?

669
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:09.378
I'm 18. You don't own me!
I hate you!

670
01:05:09.414 --> 01:05:12.977
Watch your mouth. young lady!
That's not the dress I bought
for you!

671
01:05:13.012 --> 01:05:15.083
Take a chill pill. Mom!

672
01:05:15.119 --> 01:05:18.251
Everyone will laugh at me
if I wear that thing!

673
01:05:18.287 --> 01:05:21.852
Well. if you're not changing.
you're not going!

674
01:05:21.888 --> 01:05:24.061
No! No! No! No!

675
01:05:24.096 --> 01:05:27.426
I'm not going to the prom
dressed like an old spinster!

676
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:45.477
No! Emma! No!

677
01:06:05.265 --> 01:06:07.499
What the fuck is going on here.
Eugene?

678
01:06:08.473 --> 01:06:09.600
Where's Jessie?

679
01:06:10.601 --> 01:06:13.543
And who is this crazy girl
following me?

680
01:06:13.579 --> 01:06:15.276
It's my twin sister. Emma.

681
01:06:21.918 --> 01:06:26.617
Bring him to the Lobby. Please.

682
01:06:39.766 --> 01:06:40.763
Eugene?

683
01:06:42.203 --> 01:06:44.503
I have him here. Eugene?
Where are you?

684
01:06:48.577 --> 01:06:50.075
Eugene?

685
01:06:50.111 --> 01:06:53.182
-Eugene? Eugene?

686
01:06:56.987 --> 01:06:59.419
What the fuck did you do with
Jessie?

687
01:07:08.328 --> 01:07:10.529
I hope that idiot
didn't kill him.

688
01:07:16.939 --> 01:07:19.538
Fuck! You fucking shot me!

689
01:07:26.046 --> 01:07:29.119
What the fuck?

690
01:07:29.619 --> 01:07:31.253
God damn!

691
01:07:33.221 --> 01:07:36.357
Fuck! What the fuck
is your problem?

692
01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.757
Eugene?

693
01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:48.204
Good. He's not dead yet.

694
01:07:49.239 --> 01:07:51.501
David. if you ever want to see
Jessie again.

695
01:07:51.537 --> 01:07:54.573
I suggest you drag yourself
over here.

696
01:07:55.781 --> 01:07:57.840
What is this?
What's going on?

697
01:07:59.311 --> 01:08:01.250
This is my private space.

698
01:08:02.552 --> 01:08:06.222
You think Betancourt could keep
Emma controlled with just drugs?

699
01:08:07.559 --> 01:08:08.719
He had help...

700
01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.157
From me.

701
01:08:11.193 --> 01:08:13.356
Where's Jessie?
I need to see her.

702
01:08:13.391 --> 01:08:15.264
Keep the gun on him. Salim.

703
01:08:16.568 --> 01:08:18.135
He's a strong one.

704
01:08:19.732 --> 01:08:23.140
-Jessie...
-Shut up! This will be over soon
enough.

705
01:08:31.076 --> 01:08:32.712
Move! Move!

706
01:08:32.748 --> 01:08:33.843
All right!

707
01:08:57.402 --> 01:08:59.141
What are you doing down here?

708
01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:02.270
-It smells like death.
-None of your business.

709
01:09:02.306 --> 01:09:04.012
Now. tie him up.

710
01:09:04.048 --> 01:09:07.342
No! No!
He's bleeding!

711
01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:08.845
Will you shut up?

712
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:15.622
Don't you understand
you're making things
worse for yourself?

713
01:09:15.657 --> 01:09:19.427
That the demon inside of Emma
gets stronger with anger.

714
01:09:19.462 --> 01:09:22.397
It will kill you in a heartbeat
and suck out your soul.

715
01:09:31.675 --> 01:09:32.902
Ah. fuck!

716
01:09:34.744 --> 01:09:36.609
Hey. Jessie!

717
01:09:38.075 --> 01:09:43.244
Fuck man. It's gonna be okay.
I-- I got it under control.

718
01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.749
Ow! Okay.

719
01:10:14.247 --> 01:10:16.283
Oh poor Betancourt.

720
01:10:16.318 --> 01:10:18.717
I'm gonna miss
these excellent powders.

721
01:10:28.934 --> 01:10:31.730
What is your problem. princess?

722
01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:34.733
Don't you want eternal life?

723
01:10:35.134 --> 01:10:36.565
It's simple.

724
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.768
See. I give you to the beast.

725
01:10:38.803 --> 01:10:42.104
And he gives me back
my precious sister.

726
01:10:42.139 --> 01:10:47.981
Now we get out of this hotel
and you get to stay... Forever!

727
01:10:58.356 --> 01:11:00.363
It's not that bad!

728
01:11:01.826 --> 01:11:04.763
It's really not.
It's really not that bad!

729
01:11:45.206 --> 01:11:46.409
What about my children?

730
01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:49.342
What about Rohan and Dev?

731
01:11:49.378 --> 01:11:51.214
I only brought these two
down here

732
01:11:51.249 --> 01:11:54.016
so you could sacrifice them
for my children.

733
01:11:54.051 --> 01:11:56.452
Your children are dead. Salim.

734
01:11:57.152 --> 01:11:58.515
You're a fool. Salim.

735
01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:00.984
This has always been about Emma.

736
01:12:01.958 --> 01:12:04.260
You promised me!

737
01:12:04.296 --> 01:12:07.659
I stayed here
and managed these dead souls!

738
01:12:07.694 --> 01:12:10.467
Relived their lives
over and over again!

739
01:12:10.502 --> 01:12:14.331
I've had to watch
my own children die.
day after day!

740
01:12:14.366 --> 01:12:17.902
And now you're telling me
there is no demon.
there's just your sister?

741
01:12:18.941 --> 01:12:19.976
You owe me!

742
01:13:36.488 --> 01:13:39.086
-Stop. Eugene!
You can't do this!

743
01:13:42.090 --> 01:13:43.526
Come. Daddy!

744
01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:49.125
We're happy here!

745
01:13:53.269 --> 01:13:55.838
Come play with us forever!

746
01:13:58.076 --> 01:14:00.972
No! You've wasted 30 years!

747
01:14:26.331 --> 01:14:27.603
Emma!

748
01:14:29.567 --> 01:14:31.101
Sweet little Emma.

749
01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.040
Forever a child.

750
01:14:38.213 --> 01:14:39.846
Please forgive me.

751
01:14:41.446 --> 01:14:42.849
I love you!

752
01:15:07.812 --> 01:15:08.809
Die!

753
01:15:49.048 --> 01:15:54.821
Jessie. Jessie!
You gotta get outta here. baby!

754
01:15:54.857 --> 01:15:56.989
I'm gonna find help. okay?
It's going to be okay.

755
01:15:57.994 --> 01:15:59.759
Baby--

756
01:15:59.795 --> 01:16:01.827
I don't think
I'm gonna make it outta here.

757
01:16:01.862 --> 01:16:04.562
No. it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

758
01:16:04.597 --> 01:16:06.897
I love you.

759
01:16:06.932 --> 01:16:09.265
I love you too!
Look. I love you too.

760
01:16:12.738 --> 01:16:17.310
Take my phone. so maybe...

761
01:16:17.345 --> 01:16:20.249
-maybe it will work
and you can get help.
-I'm gonna get some help.

762
01:16:20.284 --> 01:16:21.916
You's gonna be okay. right?

763
01:16:21.951 --> 01:16:24.253
I'm gonna get help. okay?
I'll be back as soon as I can.

764
01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:25.688
You're gonna be okay. yeah?

765
01:16:27.454 --> 01:16:28.889
Goodbye. baby.

766
01:17:01.654 --> 01:17:04.925
<i>The number you've reached-</i>
-Oh. you're freakin' useless!

767
01:17:08.526 --> 01:17:09.759
Help!

768
01:17:09.794 --> 01:17:11.734
Where's my car? Shit!

769
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:33.116
It's going to be okay?

770
01:17:33.151 --> 01:17:36.418
I'll be back soon. okay?
I gotta find help.

771
01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:48.100
Wait! Stop! Please help! Stop!

772
01:17:53.971 --> 01:17:55.843
Thank you. I need your help.

773
01:17:55.878 --> 01:17:57.841
Do you have a phone?
I need to call the police.

774
01:17:57.877 --> 01:18:02.077
I hope you're not one of those
drunk college students that
throws up in my back seat.

775
01:18:02.113 --> 01:18:05.012
You puke.
it's a $100 cash fee.

776
01:18:05.048 --> 01:18:07.151
No. no. no! I'm not drunk.

777
01:18:07.187 --> 01:18:10.086
I need the police!
My boyfriend has just been shot!

778
01:18:10.121 --> 01:18:11.957
Well. I don't have my phone
with me.

779
01:18:11.992 --> 01:18:13.895
but I can take you
to the police station.

780
01:18:15.792 --> 01:18:17.833
You okay?

781
01:18:19.769 --> 01:18:23.299
You look like
someone tried to hurt you.

782
01:18:23.334 --> 01:18:26.908
Please. just take me
to the police station. Go!

783
01:18:27.874 --> 01:18:30.142
Jeez. Just trying to be polite.

784
01:18:41.021 --> 01:18:43.519
Wait. wait.
Do you have to go down there?

785
01:18:43.555 --> 01:18:44.761
Yes.

786
01:18:47.364 --> 01:18:48.424
Where did you get that?

787
01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:52.032
That was in my car!
Hey!

788
01:18:53.698 --> 01:18:55.035
Your car?

789
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:58.236
-What the hell is going on?
-Why?

790
01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:02.537
Wanna take a selfie. Jessie?

791
01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:04.242
Oh. my...

792
01:19:05.710 --> 01:19:07.113
Oh. my God!

793
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:15.858
Oh! So now you wanna play hard
to get?

794
01:19:17.592 --> 01:19:19.455
This is gonna be fun.

795
01:19:24.731 --> 01:19:26.198
Look at that girl run!

796
01:19:27.264 --> 01:19:29.806
Good thing I got
my runnin' boots on!

797
01:19:31.409 --> 01:19:33.139
I'm coming for you. Jessie!

798
01:19:49.423 --> 01:19:50.893
Asshole!

799
01:19:52.395 --> 01:19:53.390
- David?

800
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:56.563
David! Where are you?

801
01:19:58.633 --> 01:20:00.133
Where you going. Jessie?

802
01:20:02.167 --> 01:20:04.401
Wanna play hide and seek.
do you?

803
01:20:06.741 --> 01:20:09.106
- David. where are you?

804
01:20:09.142 --> 01:20:11.980
Come out. come out.
wherever you are!

805
01:20:19.719 --> 01:20:21.187
Damnit. Jessie!

806
01:20:22.053 --> 01:20:23.992
Why are you such a bitch?

807
01:21:01.764 --> 01:21:03.966
Go to hell. you son of a bitch.

808
01:21:15.839 --> 01:21:17.045
David!

809
01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:28.254
David?

810
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:32.159
What are you doing here?

811
01:21:33.791 --> 01:21:35.030
Wait.

812
01:22:03.092 --> 01:22:06.490
-David? David!
-- I'm up here at the bar!

813
01:22:07.562 --> 01:22:08.690
Oh. my God.

814
01:22:10.999 --> 01:22:13.233
David. I can't believe
I found you!

815
01:22:16.505 --> 01:22:17.567
I love you.

816
01:22:19.808 --> 01:22:21.208
Okay come on. we have to go.

817
01:22:24.949 --> 01:22:28.017
You don't look so good.
Come on. let's sit down.

818
01:22:35.086 --> 01:22:37.290
Let's make a toast. hmm?

819
01:22:37.857 --> 01:22:39.020
To our victory.

820
01:22:42.893 --> 01:22:44.099
Cheers.

821
01:22:45.762 --> 01:22:47.868
What's the matter?
Aren't you going to drink up?

822
01:22:47.904 --> 01:22:49.068
Come on.
Up. up. up. drink. drink!

823
01:22:49.103 --> 01:22:52.439
No! No! I'm not
in the mood for whiskey!

824
01:22:52.475 --> 01:22:55.770
I mean you have no idea
what I've been through
since I left for help!

825
01:22:55.805 --> 01:22:58.507
That stalker guy from the
antique store stole my car

826
01:22:58.542 --> 01:23:01.846
and took that creepy furry thing
with him.

827
01:23:01.881 --> 01:23:05.182
I mean. he picked me up
in a fake taxi and is in here
trying to hurt me.

828
01:23:05.218 --> 01:23:08.089
Didn't you hear him?
He's crazy!

829
01:23:08.125 --> 01:23:11.118
No. I'm sorry. I can't say
that I heard anything.

830
01:23:11.154 --> 01:23:14.856
I've been a little busy myself.
dealing with dead kids
tormenting me.

831
01:23:14.891 --> 01:23:18.529
and that dead guy Thomas.
he hangs himself
in front of me.

832
01:23:18.564 --> 01:23:23.369
and then I crawl to the elevator
and back to our room.

833
01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:29.111
I'm sorry but I...
oh no no no...

834
01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:33.643
There you are.

835
01:23:40.458 --> 01:23:42.224
And who's this?

836
01:23:42.259 --> 01:23:45.721
I thought you said that your
boyfriend was shot and dying?

837
01:23:47.258 --> 01:23:49.230
Did you lie to me. Jessie?

838
01:23:52.201 --> 01:23:54.866
Or is he one of the dead bodies
in the basement?

839
01:23:54.901 --> 01:23:57.799
Now. now. Be nice.

840
01:23:59.405 --> 01:24:02.640
I was shot.
but I'm feeling much better now.

841
01:24:02.675 --> 01:24:07.116
I think Jessie just over-reacted
when she saw so much blood.

842
01:24:07.151 --> 01:24:09.952
Jessie. Jessie. how many times
do I have to tell you

843
01:24:09.987 --> 01:24:13.718
the dangers of
too much online exposure?

844
01:24:13.753 --> 01:24:14.750
David!

845
01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.492
No more exposure
when I'm through with you.

846
01:24:21.092 --> 01:24:22.626
Apologize to her!

847
01:24:26.834 --> 01:24:27.933
Now.

848
01:24:36.573 --> 01:24:39.344
I'm really sorry.
I love Jessie.

849
01:24:39.379 --> 01:24:42.348
I think she's so pretty.
And smart and funny.

850
01:24:42.384 --> 01:24:44.350
And she was nice to me
when I was a total creep.

851
01:24:44.386 --> 01:24:46.317
I'm really sorry.
it was a huge misunderstanding.

852
01:24:46.352 --> 01:24:48.289
-I won't do it again.
-Shh. It's okay.

853
01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:53.294
I'm sorry. Jessie.

854
01:25:06.809 --> 01:25:08.474
What's wrong. Jessie?

855
01:25:10.143 --> 01:25:13.177
I thought that you loved me.

856
01:25:13.212 --> 01:25:15.349
I was gonna propose to you.

857
01:25:17.887 --> 01:25:19.749
But when I got back to our room.

858
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:22.752
the ring was gone.

859
01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:27.889
Any idea where it went?

860
01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:31.667
No. David. I have no clue.

861
01:25:31.702 --> 01:25:33.330
What's wrong with you?

862
01:25:33.366 --> 01:25:34.896
"What's wrong with you?"

863
01:25:36.837 --> 01:25:38.001
Stop. David!

864
01:25:41.308 --> 01:25:44.345
Come here. Jessie.
Come here. Jessie.

865
01:25:45.244 --> 01:25:46.578
Come here. Jessie.

866
01:25:48.883 --> 01:25:49.878
Stay with me.

867
01:25:51.447 --> 01:25:55.389
And we can live.
Here!

868
01:25:57.692 --> 01:25:58.788
Forever.

869
01:26:00.057 --> 01:26:01.263
Hmm?

870
01:26:02.158 --> 01:26:03.397
Hmm?

871
01:26:22.346 --> 01:26:25.617
David. I'm so sorry.

872
01:26:28.723 --> 01:26:29.755
David.

873
01:26:43.103 --> 01:26:46.242
David. I'm so sorry...
