I'll let you walk the deck a few times

Part of the deal?

593
00:39:50.625 --> 00:39:52.416
It's the reason he came to America.

594

You're not part of any deal.

Do you think people around here
care if you win or lose?

We can't win.

00:48:08.083 --> 00:48:09.500
[speaking German]

703
00:48:09.583 --> 00:48:12.750
[Sullivan] I've fought against
female athletics most of my life.

704
00:48:12.833 --> 00:48:15.125
I voted against women
competing in the Olympics.

705
00:48:15.208 --> 00:48:17.750
Yes. Mr. Sullivan. I'm aware
of the fact that you're a Temper Kop.

706
00:48:17.833 --> 00:48:18.833
[secretaries giggling]

707
00:48:18.916 --> 00:48:19.916
[giggling stops]

708
00:48:21.875 --> 00:48:22.875
What is that?

709
00:48:22.958 --> 00:48:24.708
Yiddish for "imbecile."

710
00:48:25.875 --> 00:48:29.083
And yet you come here and ask me to pay
for Trudy to swim the Channel.

711
00:48:29.166 --> 00:48:30.750
after she embarrassed us in Paris.

712
00:48:30.833 --> 00:48:34.583
She didn't train for three weeks
because of you. You failed her.

713
00:48:35.333 --> 00:48:38.166
You need Trudy. Mr. Sullivan.
Think of the publicity.

714
00:48:39.208 --> 00:48:42.416
The Channel is 21 miles across.

715
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.791
Currents changing every few hours.

716
00:48:44.875 --> 00:48:48.375
To fight those currents.
she'd have to swim close to 50 miles.

717
00:48:50.083 --> 00:48:51.666
The water is freezing.

718
00:48:52.208 --> 00:48:56.625
Storms blow in without warning
and bring waves 20 feet high.

719
00:48:56.708 --> 00:48:58.750
There's jellyfish and sharks.

720
00:48:58.833 --> 00:49:02.541
even the occasional unexploded mine
left over from the war.

721
00:49:02.625 --> 00:49:03.625
[sighs]

722
00:49:03.708 --> 00:49:06.166
I honestly believe she'll die
in that water.

723
00:49:06.666 --> 00:49:08.666
I don't need that publicity.

724
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:09.916
Now. if you'll excuse me.

725
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.500
I have to meet my mother for dinner
in the Jersey Highlands.

726
00:49:13.833 --> 00:49:15.541
It's her 88th birthday.

727
00:49:15.625 --> 00:49:20.208
She's requested Penner's for lobster.
a table on the water.

728
00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:22.625
What if I meet you there. Mr. Sullivan?

729
00:49:24.083 --> 00:49:25.208
[chuckling] I don't understand.

730
00:49:25.291 --> 00:49:29.333
You drive your car.
and I'll swim from New York to New Jersey.

731
00:49:29.416 --> 00:49:32.166
[scoffs] You wanna swim to Jersey?

732
00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:35.166
It's about seven miles across
the lower bay from Rockaway Point.

733
00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:39.500
We'll make a deal. If I make it.
the AOU pays my way to the Channel.

734
00:49:39.583 --> 00:49:43.000

736
00:49:45.875 --> 00:49:48.416
Seven miles. In how many hours?

737
00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.000
-Five.
-I'll do it in four.

738
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:52.875
Three.

739
00:49:53.375 --> 00:49:54.541
[chuckles]

740
00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:57.750
Do it in three. and we'll sponsor you.

741
00:49:59.583 --> 00:50:01.708
And dinner will be on me.

742
00:50:10.375 --> 00:50:14.083
[Eppy] Right now. it's 6:30.
Ride the evening tide. Don't fight it.

743
00:50:14.166 --> 00:50:15.958
Keep the sunset on your right shoulder.

744
00:50:16.541 --> 00:50:18.833
We don't have a guide boat.
You need to watch for barges.

745
00:50:18.916 --> 00:50:21.208
Use the Highlands lighthouse
as your guide.

746
00:50:21.291 --> 00:50:22.958
If you get lost. follow the buoys.

747
00:50:23.041 --> 00:50:25.291
There's moorings all the way to Jersey.

748
00:50:25.375 --> 00:50:27.916
-What's the name of the restaurant?
-Penner's.

749
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.416
That way. Go!

750

Sorry. Mrs. Epstein. A deal's a deal.

It's 9:30. Her time is up.

765
00:52:04.541 --> 00:52:05.875
How was dinner. Mr. Sullivan?

766
00:52:08.416 --> 00:52:12.750
Two hours and 56 minutes.
Your men will verify the time.

Where were you?

773
00:52:31.875 --> 00:52:33.541
If your father finds out
you're home this late--

774
00:52:33.625 --> 00:52:34.916
I was swimming.

775
00:52:35.916 --> 00:52:38.541
Swimming? At night?

776
00:52:39.125 --> 00:52:40.500
To New Jersey.

777
00:52:40.583 --> 00:52:42.666
I swam from New York to Jersey.

778
00:52:44.125 --> 00:52:45.750
Did you say New Jersey?

779
00:52:48.333 --> 00:52:50.083
I leave for the Channel next week.

780
00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:51.250
[speaking German]

781
00:52:53.333 --> 00:52:57.833
You are my child.
And the thing you love most. it…

782
00:52:59.625 --> 00:53:01.083
it terrifies me.

783
00:53:06.791 --> 00:53:09.625
I-- I-- I can't stay here.

784
00:53:10.291 --> 00:53:12.333
I look at Meg. the other girls…

785
00:53:13.333 --> 00:53:15.208
I don't know how to be like them.

786
00:53:26.333 --> 00:53:27.791
[Gertrude] I had a twin sister.

787
00:53:30.583 --> 00:53:32.208
She drowned when we were seven.

788
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.250
What was her name?

790
00:53:47.333 --> 00:53:49.458
I won't be there
if something happens to you.

791
00:53:52.333 --> 00:53:54.500
I can't imagine where you get the courage.

792
00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:01.250
From you.

793
00:54:12.375 --> 00:54:15.250
Tell me what it's like
out there in the dark.

794
00:54:17.791 --> 00:54:20.708
Well. tonight. while I was swimming.
a harbor seal followed me. [chuckles]

795
00:54:21.541 --> 00:54:22.541
A seal followed you?

796
00:54:24.916 --> 00:54:26.291
I'm pretty sure.

797
00:54:26.375 --> 00:54:29.833
Not followed. Trudy. Chased.

Trudy. I'd like you to meet the man
I've selected to train you.

802

Charlotte Epstein is going to train me.

803
00:54:55.541 --> 00:54:58.625
A woman training a woman? Ha.

804
00:54:58.708 --> 00:55:01.625
Like a lion taming a lion. Bad idea.
[laughs]

805
00:55:01.708 --> 00:55:02.708
She's my coach.

806

Mr. Wolffe is your coach. Trudy.

807

[Wolffe laughs]

808
00:55:07.541 --> 00:55:08.958
Or we don't sponsor.

809
00:55:10.208 --> 00:55:13.666
[Wolffe] Don't worry. darling.
I'll take care of you in that big ocean.

[patron clears throat]

815

[inhales deeply] We're drinking
to our friend Rudolph Vittali.

816
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:59.750
He died this week trying to cross.

817
00:55:59.833 --> 00:56:02.875
He got lost in the darkness
of the shallows.

818
00:56:03.833 --> 00:56:08.750
See. this is a place
where men come to risk everything.

819
00:56:08.833 --> 00:56:09.958
So…

828
00:56:53.125 --> 00:56:54.791
It's not a race.

00:57:07.125 --> 00:57:09.041

[Horlick] News coming from Europe.

where Trudy Ederle
trains to swim the English Channel.

836
00:57:29.791 --> 00:57:33.791
The odds of her making it have been
set by Lloyd's of London at 100-to-1.

837
00:57:33.875 --> 00:57:38.000
Babe Ruth predicted today that this is
one long shot that will not come in.

838

He can suck an egg.

…whether this type of swim should be
considered sport for women.

841
00:57:54.583 --> 00:57:55.791
How many times have you tried?

842
00:57:58.208 --> 00:57:59.916
Twelve. [chuckles]

843
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.166
Once I came within a few miles.

844
00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:05.541
but the tide from the Atlantic
came in sideways. oof.

845
00:58:06.458 --> 00:58:08.125
Pushed me toward the shallows.

The last obstacle before England.

847
00:58:11.416 --> 00:58:13.083
They saved me. you know.

hell on earth. where the current. it just…

850
00:58:20.666 --> 00:58:22.833
It's impossible to break.

They're rooting against us. Trudy.

852
00:58:27.541 --> 00:58:29.375
They want the water to win.

You've got to look good for the papers.
Eat like a lady.

Benji. take a look outside.

Looks like you might have some company
for your swim tomorrow.

it's a straight line to England.

[Burgess speaking. indistinct]

1394
01:40:34.833 --> 01:40:39.958
[distantly] She'll come through the mouth
of Dover onto the Kingsdown Beach.

1395
01:40:40.041 --> 01:40:43.208
She'll have to swim across the
shallows for the last five miles alone.

1396
01:40:43.958 --> 01:40:47.708
What if she gets lost in the dark?
What if she gets sucked out to the sea?

1397
01:40:47.791 --> 01:40:48.791
She can do it.

1398
01:40:49.541 --> 01:40:53.208
Take her out of the water now.
Mr. Burgess. Get my daughter out!

1399
01:40:54.375 --> 01:40:55.875
Get my daughter out!

1400
01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:00.500
I will not take her out.

1401
01:41:00.583 --> 01:41:01.916
Take my daughter out!

1402
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.666
As long as she wants to swim. she swims!

1403
01:41:06.791 --> 01:41:08.750
-She'll make it.
-[Henry] No. we are losing light.

1404
01:41:09.333 --> 01:41:11.500
She's frozen stiff. She's slowing down.

1405
01:41:11.583 --> 01:41:14.083
She will be alone in the dark
without a ship to guide her!

1406
01:41:14.166 --> 01:41:17.375
-Hey! Hey!
-[Henry] I want her out of the water!

1407
01:41:18.708 --> 01:41:19.708
Trudy!

1408
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.333
Trudy. we can't follow you
through the shallows.

1409
01:41:25.416 --> 01:41:27.166
Without us. you will be lost.

1410
01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:30.708
Get out now. The swim is over.

1411
01:41:38.083 --> 01:41:39.083
It's not over.

1412
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:46.875
I love you.

1413
01:42:00.458 --> 01:42:01.750
We'll meet her on the beach.

1414
01:42:09.041 --> 01:42:11.708
[engine rumbling]

1415
01:43:05.208 --> 01:43:07.791
[news anchor 1] Having achieved
more than so many men before her.

1416
01:43:07.875 --> 01:43:11.375
Trudy Ederle now attempts
the final stretch of the swim.

1417
01:43:11.875 --> 01:43:14.958
[Horlick] Trudy Ederle has entered
the shallows alone.

1418
01:43:15.041 --> 01:43:18.208
A sandbank
that guards the shores of England.

1419
01:43:18.291 --> 01:43:21.458
[new anchor 2] Mademoiselle Trudy Ederle
has spent almost 13 hours in the water

1420
01:43:21.541 --> 01:43:24.708
in freezing temperatures
in the most perilous part of the swim.

1421
01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:02.041
[breathing shakily]

1422
01:44:08.583 --> 01:44:11.291
[thunder rumbling]

1423
01:44:16.916 --> 01:44:18.500
[whimpers]

1424
01:44:23.333 --> 01:44:25.291
[coughing. panting]

1425
01:44:31.416 --> 01:44:32.416
No.

1426
01:44:51.208 --> 01:44:52.500
[whimpers]

1427
01:44:56.625 --> 01:44:58.333
No. no. no!

1428
01:44:59.333 --> 01:45:01.958
No. no! [coughs]

1429
01:45:02.583 --> 01:45:05.083
No! [crying]

1430
01:45:20.291 --> 01:45:22.166
[Horlick] She's lost in the shallows.

1431
01:45:23.291 --> 01:45:24.375
They can't find her.

1432
01:45:24.458 --> 01:45:26.875
[sniffles. sobs]

1433
01:45:33.291 --> 01:45:37.583
[Horlick] We have reports that
Trudy Ederle is lost in the Goodwin Sands.

1434
01:45:37.666 --> 01:45:39.750
only five miles from England.

1435
01:45:42.708 --> 01:45:47.125
We pray she finds her way to Dover
and the beach at Kingsdown.

1436
01:46:00.583 --> 01:46:03.166
[gasps. coughs]

1437
01:46:05.208 --> 01:46:06.958
[sobs. coughs]

1438
01:46:15.875 --> 01:46:17.875
[breathing shakily]

1439
01:46:21.416 --> 01:46:23.583
[gasps. shivering]

1440
01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:48.416
[Henry] We have to go back on that boat
and find her.

1441
01:46:49.041 --> 01:46:51.666
[Burgess] There's no going back.
This is where it ends.

1442
01:46:52.458 --> 01:46:53.708
[Henry] It's been hours!

1443
01:46:55.041 --> 01:46:57.208
How is she supposed to find her way?

1444
01:46:57.291 --> 01:46:59.416
[horns honking]

1445
01:47:04.125 --> 01:47:05.125
Look.

1446
01:47:19.541 --> 01:47:21.625

1447
01:47:30.916 --> 01:47:32.125
[sighs] Please.

1448
01:47:32.625 --> 01:47:34.500
[shivering]

1449
01:47:55.541 --> 01:47:58.208
[Horlick] There's fires burning
on the cliffs of Dover

1450
01:47:58.291 --> 01:48:01.041
as the world stops now and waits.

1451
01:48:02.958 --> 01:48:05.291
We are all with her
in that freezing water.

1452
01:48:05.375 --> 01:48:08.000
Tonight. we're all with Trudy.

1453
01:48:18.625 --> 01:48:21.416

01:49:33.083 --> 01:49:34.958
[chattering]

1455
01:49:38.666 --> 01:49:39.666
There!

1456
01:49:40.375 --> 01:49:41.416
-Where?
-There!

1457
01:49:46.125 --> 01:49:47.208
[gasps]

1458
01:49:49.458 --> 01:49:50.500
-[Burgess] It's--
-Trudy!

1459

[spectators clamoring]

1464
01:50:09.125 --> 01:50:10.333
Nobody touches her!

Come on. Let's go. It's time for school.

1496
01:53:17.708 --> 01:53:18.833
School?

1497
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:21.291
Trudy just swam the Channel.

1498
01:53:21.375 --> 01:53:23.583
Yes. she did. but you did not.

1499

[laughter]

1500
01:53:34.166 --> 01:53:39.083
Ladies and gentlemen. today I can report
that the greatest athlete in the world

1501
01:53:39.166 --> 01:53:41.791
is not Babe Ruth or Jack Dempsey.

1502
01:53:42.958 --> 01:53:49.000
The greatest athlete in the world is
a young woman from New York City.

1503
01:53:50.583 --> 01:53:51.791
Trudy Ederle.

1504
01:53:54.958 --> 01:53:59.208

Uh. I'm sorry. I-I can't let you
into the country without a passport.

1509
01:54:19.833 --> 01:54:21.958
[laughing]

1510
01:54:22.041 --> 01:54:24.083
You-- You're gonna have to call someone.

[Eppy] You did it.

1517
01:55:23.916 --> 01:55:25.041
Yes!

1518
01:55:25.125 --> 01:55:27.000
[laughs] Benji!

1519
01:55:27.083 --> 01:55:30.166
It's your time. Trudy. This is your time.

1520
01:55:30.708 --> 01:55:32.250
-[mayor] Trudy. we have to go.
-Go on. Trudy!

1521
01:55:34.166 --> 01:55:35.541
My coach rides with me.

1522
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:42.083
[spectators cheering]

1523
01:55:58.291 --> 01:56:00.000
Yeah. Trudy!

1524
01:56:13.208 --> 01:56:14.666
The Yankees!

1525
01:56:15.208 --> 01:56:17.125
Yeah! [laughs]

1526
