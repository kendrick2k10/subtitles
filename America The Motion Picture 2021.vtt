Sorry. Tom. "We the People" it is.

You can use "Us rich white guys"
on your Christmas card.

16
00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:41.791
Mmm. at Dartmouth.
we play with actual paddles.

-Ooh! We should take a picture!

24
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:02.083

Abraham Lincoln.

34
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.416
[Abe] Four score and seven years ago.

35
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.875
I swore an oath to never tell a lie.

36
00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:02.125
To be true to my family. my friends.
and the Republic for which they stand.

37
00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:07.708
which is why I am compelled.
by divine duty. to tell you

38
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:10.583
your prices are fucking insane!

39
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:13.125
Wow. easy. Take it up with the King.

40
00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:15.625
-Something about taxation!
-[colonists] Yeah. that's right!

41
00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:17.750
Dude. I just work here.

42
00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:20.208
But… Uh…
Something about representation!

43
00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:21.958
-Yeah!
-You tell 'em. Abe!

44
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.833
-[George] Abe!
-This isn't over. pal!

45
00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:25.791
[colonists] Yeah!

46
00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:28.541
[sighs] You don't gotta be
such a damn tyrant about it.

47
00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:31.250
[George] Abe! Look at me! [laughs]

48
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:33.916
-This guy dared me to climb up here.
-[man] No. I didn't.

49
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.208
Well. you should've! Whoo!

50
00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:37.958
-[colonists cheering]
-Yeah!

51
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:40.875
George. you are a wild man.

52
00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.500
[sighs] What can I say?

53
00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:45.250
Somebody's gotta
balance out all your boring politics.

54
00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:48.666
[chuckles] George. I guess
that's what makes us such a good team.

55
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.250
A team that will last until we both die
of natural causes and old age.

56
00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:54.333
in our forties.

57
00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:57.541
But I do wish ya cared
about more than just partying.

58
00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:00.625
[gasps] Abe! I care
about more than that. all right?

59
00:03:00.708 --> 00:03:04.000
I also care about… how good we look!

60
00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:07.958
Oh. George.
You paid 35 bucks for a T-blouse?

61
00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:12.416
No. I paid 70 bucks for two T-blouses.

62
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.333
Twinsies!

63
00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:17.083
George. I wish I had
a million friends like you.

64
00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:19.916
-Should I put it on my body?
-Yeah. put it on your body.

65
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.208
Oh. it feels so soft on my body.

66
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:25.958
-It's like a blend. Is it a blend?
-It's a tri-blend.

67
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:28.791
Oh. it's so soft.
I'd swear it's a quad blend.

68
00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.125
-I know. [sighs]
-Oh. shit. oh!

69
00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:32.166
Oh. here comes Ben.

70
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.000
-Ooh! Uh. hey. Ben.
-Benedict.

71
00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:38.333
Oh. sorry. Last two.

72
00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:40.583
[drums beating]

73
00:03:45.416 --> 00:03:47.000
[crowd cheering]

74
00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:53.333
I'm so glad you came.

75
00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:56.833
Mmm. I was worried
that you might have caught wind

76
00:03:56.916 --> 00:03:58.250
of my little surprise.

77
00:03:58.333 --> 00:03:59.416
No. not at all. man.

78
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.500
These are boffo seats!
We didn't even see this coming at all.

79
00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:03.958
What are you up to?

80
00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:06.541
You hate surprises and general whimsy.

81
00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.583
I've always told you. Abraham.

82
00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:10.958
that your revolution
would be the end of you.

83
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:14.500
And I've always told you. Ben.
that I was willing to take that chance.

84
00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:17.333
That we should all
be willing to take that chance.

85
00:04:17.416 --> 00:04:19.625
[laughs]

86
00:04:19.708 --> 00:04:21.708
Yes. you have.

87
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:24.541
The only problem is
you assumed. all this time.

88
00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:27.958
that I'm part of your "we." when. in fact.

89
00:04:28.041 --> 00:04:31.416
I'm with a different "we." now.

90
00:04:32.916 --> 00:04:35.125
Uh. I didn't… I don't get it.

91
00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:38.041
I changed teams. assholes.

92
00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:40.208
Oh. Ben. good for you!

93
00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:43.125
I'm so glad
that you're embracing your true self.

94
00:04:43.208 --> 00:04:45.666
No! I'm gonna be fuckin' rich.

95
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.541
Oh. Rich sounds like a great guy.
would love to meet him.

96
00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:52.125
-We could do a double date?
-You're misunderstanding.

97
00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.125
-I'll be doing the Redcoat Shuffle.
-Hey.

98
00:04:54.208 --> 00:04:57.000
Whatever you guys do
in private is your business.

99
00:04:57.083 --> 00:04:58.916
That's one of the things
we're fighting for!

100
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.125
Stop being so damn accepting for a minute!

101
00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:04.541
I have aligned myself with the Brits.

102
00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:06.291
Oh. Ohh!

103
00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:08.083
[hesitating] George. are you hearing this?

104
00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:09.583
Are you seeing this?

105
00:05:09.666 --> 00:05:12.916
Abe. they're using things as instruments
that you're not supposed to use.

106
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.208
-It's crazy!
-George. fuck!

107
00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:17.791
[hesitates] You've sided
with the fun police?

108
00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:20.833
Something about taxation.
Don't you remember?

109
00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:24.458
Hot take. Abe. Fun sucks.

110
00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:27.333
The Declaration was signed tonight. Ben.

111
00:05:27.416 --> 00:05:30.416
You're too late
to stop the revolution. Ha-ha!

112
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.416
-Oh. am I?
-[Abe gasps]

113
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.791
-Your friends in revolution are all dead.
-[Abe] What?

114
00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:38.791
And as for your precious
Declaration of Independence…

115
00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:41.833
-Oh. it's beautiful!
-A-Kelly Ripa!

116
00:05:41.916 --> 00:05:43.333
[Abe] No!

117
00:05:43.416 --> 00:05:45.500
But you're Benedict "Cosby" Arnold!

118
00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:47.916
-You're better than this!
-You're right.

119
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.541
I am.

120
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:51.708
[growls]

121
00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:54.875
[screams]

122
00:05:55.916 --> 00:05:56.791
[groans]

123
00:05:56.875 --> 00:06:00.041
Abe. what the… Oh. my God.
Your neck's… Oh. my God!

124
00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:02.916
Your neck is bleeding!
Is this part of the show?

125
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.125
Look. I don't do well
with interactive theater. okay?

126
00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:06.500
It kinda freaks me out.

127
00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:08.750
I know. That's great.
We're number one. I get that.

128
00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:10.875
But I don't see what that has to do with…

129
00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.583
Arnold. behind you.

130
00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:14.500
No. Abe. I'm George.

131
00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:16.125
It's George!

132
00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:18.291
George. turn around.

133
00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:20.083
Ben! Ben. what the fuck. man?

134
00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:21.875
[slurps]

135
00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:25.000
Someday. Georgie.
you'll have to draft a document

136
00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:28.708
that specifically outlines
the punishment for what I just did.

137
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:32.000
But for now. I bid you adieu.

138
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:33.750
Nyah!

139
00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:36.250
[grunts]

140
00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:39.333
Sic semper my dick. bitches!

141
00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:41.083
[crowd cheers]

142
00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:42.625
This is the weirdest show.

143
00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:44.000
Abe. [spits]

144
00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:45.375
Abe. are you okay?

145
00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:48.875
-No. my throat has been roadhoused.
-[spitting] Ah. it's in my mouth.

146
00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.583
I'm dying. George.

147
00:06:50.666 --> 00:06:53.458
No. you will not die!
You shut your mouth!

148
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:56.166
-I will shut my mouth.
-[spitting]

149
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.416
-Forever.
-Stop it! [spits]

150
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.416
-Abe. you're gonna make it.
-Yes. to the other side.

151
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.125
No! Back to this side! Where you belong!

152
00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:08.958
George. you must free the colonies.

153
00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:13.041
No! That's your thing. Abe.
It's not mine.

154
00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:16.666
It's yours now. George.
I believe in you.

155
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.208
-[spits]
-Free the colonies.

156
00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:21.375
Found a new country.

157
00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:22.958
Name her…

158
00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:26.541
Name her what. babe?
You tell me what you want me to name her.

159
00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:28.875
God damn it! You son of a bitch!

160
00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:33.625
Whatever you tell me to name her.
that's what I'm gonna name her. Abie!

161
00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:37.541
Name her America.

162
00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:38.958
[eagle screeches]

163
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.666
Is that your top choice?

164
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.875
We can spitball some options.
see if we can beat it.

165
00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.875
There is no time. George.

166
00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.000
My death-shit is imminent.

167
00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:50.541
America. okay? Just remember…

168
00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:54.166

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.416
Isn't that why you've come to me?

521
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.333
Because you need help
toppling the British?

522
00:24:42.416 --> 00:24:45.583
Yes! [chuckles] Exactly! That is…
Wait. how did you know that?

523
00:24:45.666 --> 00:24:48.458
Word travels fast in these parts.
George Washington with an "O."

524
00:24:48.541 --> 00:24:50.833
I… I don't know.
Now that I'm thinking about it.

525
00:24:50.916 --> 00:24:54.125
sorcerers are so 1775. am I right?

526
00:24:54.208 --> 00:24:56.291
Cool. because I'm not a sorcerer.

527
00:24:56.375 --> 00:24:57.791
I'm a scientist.

528
00:24:57.875 --> 00:24:59.208
[laughing]

529
00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:02.583
There's no such thing as science.

530
00:25:02.666 --> 00:25:05.875
Oh. my God. did you guys hear that?

531
00:25:05.958 --> 00:25:08.333
-Really? No such thing as science. huh?
-[Samuel] Yeah.

532
00:25:08.416 --> 00:25:09.791
Then what do you call this?

533
00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:12.000
Science!

534
00:25:12.666 --> 00:25:14.041
-[exploding]
-[all] Oh! Wow!

535
00:25:14.125 --> 00:25:16.958
-Yay!
-Yeah. I call them conduction gloves.

536
00:25:17.041 --> 00:25:20.208
The science is simple. really.
They harness the subatomic--

537
00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:23.250
Oh. wait. no. don't tell us. dude.
That's gonna ruin the trick.

538
00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:25.041
Yeah. it's more fun not to know!

539
00:25:25.125 --> 00:25:27.750
Okay. guys. let's put our heads
together here on this one.

540
00:25:27.833 --> 00:25:30.208
There's gotta be
another Thomas Edison. right?

541
00:25:30.291 --> 00:25:31.708
Like a man Thomas Edison.

542
00:25:31.791 --> 00:25:34.375
Oh. yeah. there is.
There's Thomas Edisen with an "E."

543
00:25:34.458 --> 00:25:36.000
the professional wrestler.

544
00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:37.666
Ah. that's him. Let's go get him.

545
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.125
He's cool. Big dude.
Wears spandex. if you're into that.

546
00:25:40.208 --> 00:25:43.625
But he can't help you
defeat an entire army. I can.

547
00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:45.625
You would stand with us
against the British?

548
00:25:45.708 --> 00:25:48.833
[inhales] Bet your ass. Those guys suck.

549
00:25:48.916 --> 00:25:50.416
I'm just doing science.

550
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.125
And because they don't understand it.
they want to kill me?

551
00:25:53.208 --> 00:25:54.708
Man. fuck those dicks.

552
00:25:54.791 --> 00:25:57.000
Science is supposed to be fun
and they're ruining it.

553
00:25:57.083 --> 00:25:59.458
Yeah. right?
We even call 'em the fun police.

554
00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:02.041
[chuckling] Oh. man. that's good.
Can I use that?

555
00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:03.291
Uh. no.

556
00:26:03.375 --> 00:26:05.166
Problem. No problem.

557
00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.625
So. Edison.
you're obviously a great thinker.

558
00:26:07.708 --> 00:26:08.875
What would you have us do now?

559
00:26:08.958 --> 00:26:11.125
[scoffs] James has got eyes
and ears everywhere.

560
00:26:11.208 --> 00:26:12.875
If we're gonna blow up his spot.

561
00:26:12.958 --> 00:26:15.250
we need someone
who knows this land better than James.

562
00:26:15.333 --> 00:26:16.416
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

563
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.375
You can't possibly be suggesting--

564
00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:22.541
[narrator] He was a tracker.
best in the world.

565
00:26:22.625 --> 00:26:26.500
until he was sent to a British prison
for a crime he didn't commit.

566
00:26:26.583 --> 00:26:28.541
Now. he prowls the badlands.

567
00:26:28.625 --> 00:26:31.250
tracking for those
who can't track for themselves.

568
00:26:31.333 --> 00:26:33.708
If you have a problem
and you can find him.

569
00:26:33.791 --> 00:26:36.416
-maybe you can hire Geronimo.
-[eagle screeches]

570
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.333
[engine revving]

571
00:26:41.125 --> 00:26:42.250
[sniffs]

572
00:26:54.166 --> 00:26:55.083
[growls]

573
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.375
All right. what do you chuds want?

574
00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:08.125
Hey. you play lax. bro?

575
00:27:08.208 --> 00:27:09.500
Seth-chee.

576
00:27:09.583 --> 00:27:12.208
My people invented lacrosse.
all right. bro?

577
00:27:12.291 --> 00:27:14.500
[chuckles] Sure. man. Sure.

578
00:27:14.583 --> 00:27:17.750
We come as friends. mighty Geronimo…

579
00:27:17.833 --> 00:27:19.458
Nay. nay. we come as brothers.

580
00:27:19.541 --> 00:27:22.958
Mmm. Just doesn't feel right.
Feels like you're gonna try to fuck me.

581
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:24.583
What? We wouldn't. never!

582
00:27:24.666 --> 00:27:27.625
Yeah. no. I think you might.

583
00:27:27.708 --> 00:27:31.000
Like. epically.
all the way down to my descendants.

584
00:27:31.083 --> 00:27:33.083
I got a sixth sense for this shit.

585
00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:34.833
No. our word is strong.

586
00:27:34.916 --> 00:27:38.291
like your mighty Indian tribe.
the. um… the…

587
00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:40.000
Ch…

588
00:27:40.083 --> 00:27:41.083
No.

589
00:27:41.166 --> 00:27:43.125
The Chicory?

590
00:27:43.208 --> 00:27:44.625
Kay yay.

591
00:27:44.708 --> 00:27:45.666
Squa…

592
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:48.541
Sha… Sass… Sasquatch! Sasquatch.

593
00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:50.333
-Gotta be Sasquatch. There we go.
-Yes.

594
00:27:50.416 --> 00:27:53.750
Our word is strong.
like your mighty tribe. the Sasquatch.

595
00:27:53.833 --> 00:27:56.458
[groans] Fine. What do you want?

596
00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:59.000
-We seek to topple the British.
-I'm in.

597
00:27:59.083 --> 00:28:00.958
-Now. hear us out--
-Again. I'm in.

598
00:28:01.041 --> 00:28:03.666
-Not sure how much you know about them.
-Uh. quite a bit.

599
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.416
They are really. really shitty buzzkills.

600
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.958
-Really?
-Yeah. we call them. get this. here…

601
00:28:09.041 --> 00:28:11.416
-Ready? The fun police.
-"The fun police"?

602
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.750
Yeah. They all have all these rules.

603
00:28:13.833 --> 00:28:16.416
No one's allowed to have
a single independent thought.

604
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.541
and they're always taxing
the shit out of everybody!

605
00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:20.208
Yeah. that sounds rough.

606
00:28:20.291 --> 00:28:22.583
[sniffs] My issue
is just that they took my land.

607
00:28:22.666 --> 00:28:24.500
poisoned my people
to the brink of extinction.

608
00:28:24.583 --> 00:28:26.583
and murdered everyone I've ever cared for.

609
00:28:26.666 --> 00:28:28.750
So… real buzzkill.

610
00:28:28.833 --> 00:28:31.833
That is classic fun police.
Those guys have no chill.

611
00:28:31.916 --> 00:28:33.083
-Right?
-Chief Geronimo--

612
00:28:33.166 --> 00:28:34.875
-Just Geronimo is fine.
-Just Geronimo--

613
00:28:34.958 --> 00:28:35.791
Oh. God.

614
00:28:35.875 --> 00:28:38.083
We can't give you back your family.

615
00:28:38.166 --> 00:28:42.916
But join us and I promise you
justice will finally be served.

616
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.291
So. you're telling me that if I help you.

617
00:28:45.375 --> 00:28:47.375
when you win this land
back from King James.

618
00:28:47.458 --> 00:28:49.125
you'll give it back to me and my family?

619
00:28:49.208 --> 00:28:51.333
-Absolutely.
-[chuckles] Totally.

620
00:28:51.416 --> 00:28:52.416
[clears throat]

621
00:28:53.208 --> 00:28:55.750
-All of it? The whole enchilada?
-Well. I mean--

622
00:28:55.833 --> 00:28:57.166
[chuckles] Yeah. you bet we will.

623
00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.583
Sam. man. can I get
a quick sidebar with you?

624
00:28:59.666 --> 00:29:02.166
You know what?
I'm probably just being paranoid.

625
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:05.500
So. what's the plan now.
and does it involve Doritos?

626
00:29:05.583 --> 00:29:06.875
Nope. better.

627
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.583
A handkerchief.

628
00:29:08.666 --> 00:29:11.791
[foghorn blaring]

629
00:29:18.666 --> 00:29:20.541
[ominous music playing]

630
00:29:34.125 --> 00:29:35.625
[Benedict] Greetings. Your Highness.

631
00:29:35.708 --> 00:29:38.541
May I be the first to welcome you
to your New World?

632
00:29:38.625 --> 00:29:42.500
You may dispense
with the pleasantries. Arnold.

633
00:29:42.583 --> 00:29:44.291
Such as they are.

634
00:29:44.375 --> 00:29:47.541
Yes. and this is.
like. the nice part of town.

635
00:29:47.625 --> 00:29:51.125
Well. it smells like shit.
which reminds me.

636
00:29:51.208 --> 00:29:53.541
I need to make room for second breakfast.

637
00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:56.833
I've had my fill
of mushy peas and blood sausage.

638
00:29:56.916 --> 00:29:59.458
[Benedict] Yes. accommodations
at the top of your obelisk

639
00:29:59.541 --> 00:30:01.000
are more well-suited. my king.

640
00:30:01.083 --> 00:30:05.833
Then. I can assume everything
is proceeding as I have foreseen.

641
00:30:05.916 --> 00:30:07.875
Yes. your plan is proceeding.

642
00:30:07.958 --> 00:30:09.333
But we have had trouble

643
00:30:09.416 --> 00:30:12.166
with a certain colonist
not falling in line.

644
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.416
Well. has he read the rules?

645
00:30:15.125 --> 00:30:19.416
The rules should always
be posted clearly in a public place

646
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.875
where everyone can read them.

647
00:30:21.958 --> 00:30:24.500
Oh. can he… can he not read?

648
00:30:24.583 --> 00:30:27.583
Well. no. he has read them. Your Highness.

649
00:30:27.666 --> 00:30:30.666
However. he has chosen not to follow them.

650
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:34.041
-[sputtering] But they are the rules!
-I know!

651
00:30:34.125 --> 00:30:38.875
What is the point of being a ruler
if people are not following your rules?

652
00:30:38.958 --> 00:30:41.083
This is. like. King Shit 101!

653
00:30:41.166 --> 00:30:43.041
I understand. my king.

654
00:30:43.125 --> 00:30:44.291
Not following the…

655
00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:47.625
[voice trembling] Arnold.
why. do you know what this is?

656
00:30:47.708 --> 00:30:50.666
-I do.
-It's rebellion!

657
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:51.708
By definition.

658
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:55.500
We cannot allow anything
to stop my plan. Arnold!

659
00:30:55.583 --> 00:30:58.250
Crush this illiterate rebel scum!

660
00:30:58.333 --> 00:31:00.416
It will be my pleasure.

661
00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:02.625
Excellent.

662
00:31:04.583 --> 00:31:07.416
[Samuel] Dudes. are we close yet?
I'm getting hangry.

663
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.583
I could definitely eat.

664
00:31:08.666 --> 00:31:11.375
Oh. I saw a Boston Wild Wings
about a mile back.

665
00:31:11.458 --> 00:31:12.583
What's a mile?

666
00:31:12.666 --> 00:31:15.083
And I could totally
crush some B-dubs right now.

667
00:31:15.166 --> 00:31:17.416
Hey. hey! Knock it off. guys.

668
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.583
First. we start a revolution.

669
00:31:19.666 --> 00:31:21.750
Then we can have
all the Boston Wild Wings

670
00:31:21.833 --> 00:31:23.041
that we've ever dreamed of.

671
00:31:23.125 --> 00:31:25.750
just like our forefathers
prophesized. okay?

672
00:31:25.833 --> 00:31:27.791
Now. Geronimo. what do you got?

673
00:31:27.875 --> 00:31:30.708
Uh. tracking isn't an exact science.

674
00:31:30.791 --> 00:31:33.458
This is a handkerchief.
What do you think I am? A dog?

675
00:31:33.541 --> 00:31:36.750
[chuckles] Okay.
I know this is a trick question.

676
00:31:36.833 --> 00:31:40.083
so I'm gonna go
with my immediate impulse. Yes.

677
00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:41.583
Fuck you. dude. [sniffs]

678
00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:43.750
-Yeah. he's in there.
-[redcoat 1] Ello. guv'ner.

679
00:31:43.833 --> 00:31:46.208
-[redcoat 2] Ello. guv'ner.
-Ello. guv!

680
00:31:46.291 --> 00:31:48.166
[all] Ello. guv'ner.

681
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.833
All right. that's a lot of men.

682
00:31:49.916 --> 00:31:52.166
And it's a sure bet
that there's even more inside.

683
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.916
Wait. are we seriously
thinkin' about goin' in there?

684
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.125
-Look at this place! It's a quagmire!
-[all] Guv'ner!

685
00:31:58.208 --> 00:32:00.958
Guys. we could be here for years
and accomplish nothing.

686
00:32:01.041 --> 00:32:04.125
You're right.
But we'd be accomplishing nothing…

687
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:05.916
for America.

688
00:32:06.541 --> 00:32:08.458
Guys. I can't ask you
to go in there with me.

689
00:32:08.541 --> 00:32:09.375
Phew!

690
00:32:09.458 --> 00:32:11.666
-Yeah. good. because no.
-Great. Good luck.

691
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:13.250
Whoa. whoa. wait. hold on.

692
00:32:13.333 --> 00:32:16.250
I thought I'd be all like.
"No. don't. I can do it."

693
00:32:16.333 --> 00:32:19.708
And then you guys would be like.
"No. I'll come. don't worry."

694
00:32:19.791 --> 00:32:23.291
I never know the right thing to say
when I'm tryin' to lead. This sucks!

695
00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:27.708
So. yeah. I guess I am.
I'm asking you to go in there with me.

696
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.041
Will you please go in there with me?

697
00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:34.333
Huh. well. with a pep talk like that.
how could I say no?

698
00:32:34.416 --> 00:32:37.875
Pfft. whatever.
Let's just go kick some Redcoat ass!

699
00:32:37.958 --> 00:32:41.125
Wait. wait. wait! At least…
Just let me do an entrance thing.

700
00:32:41.208 --> 00:32:43.250
[redcoat] Guv'ner? [grunts]

701
00:32:43.333 --> 00:32:46.291
Ding dong! It's America. motherfucker!

702
00:32:46.375 --> 00:32:48.875
Oh. Georgie! Well. color me surprised.

703
00:32:48.958 --> 00:32:51.000
Oh. I'll color you fuckin' dead. Ben!

704
00:32:51.083 --> 00:32:52.875
[laughs] Bravo!

705
00:32:52.958 --> 00:32:55.833
Did you practice that line
in the car on your way here?

706
00:32:55.916 --> 00:32:57.250
What the fuck is a car?

707
00:32:57.333 --> 00:33:00.333
And. no. it was a rebuttal
to something that you just said!

708
00:33:00.416 --> 00:33:02.041
How could I have thought of it in advance

709
00:33:02.125 --> 00:33:04.750
if you said it just now
and I came up with the perfect rebuttal?

710
00:33:04.833 --> 00:33:06.416
Oh. pardon me.

711
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.458
I forgot you aren't versed
in the gentlemanly art of debate.

712
00:33:09.541 --> 00:33:11.250
like your best friend. Abe Lincoln.

713
00:33:11.333 --> 00:33:15.916
Oh. or should I say ex-best friend?

714
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.125
[laughs]

715
00:33:17.208 --> 00:33:18.875
-Because he's dead.
-Damn. he's good.

716
00:33:18.958 --> 00:33:20.583
-All right. fuck this.
-[glass shatters]

717
00:33:22.875 --> 00:33:26.416

-[Samuel] Yippie-kay-yay. motherfu-- Whoa!
-[electrical buzzing]

720
00:33:30.916 --> 00:33:33.166
-[Samuel] Watch it. witch!
-[Edison] You watch it. dick!

721
00:33:36.291 --> 00:33:38.333
[George] Yeah.
Well. that could've gone better.

722
00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:41.291
Ya think?
Edison almost got everybody killed!

723
00:33:41.375 --> 00:33:44.333
-Everybody almost got everybody killed!
-Where's Arnold?

724
00:33:44.416 --> 00:33:47.500
And where's Geronimo?
He smells like campfire.

725
00:33:52.541 --> 00:33:54.583
You carry an unusual scent for a man.

726
00:33:55.125 --> 00:33:57.083
Almost like you're
not a man at all. but a--

727
00:33:57.166 --> 00:33:58.208
[growls]

728
00:33:58.291 --> 00:33:59.375
[grunts]

729
00:33:59.458 --> 00:34:01.166
Stay and fight. you dick!

730
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:03.166
Damn it! Oh. my God! Geronimo!

731
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:04.541
That bastard bit me!

732
00:34:04.625 --> 00:34:06.916
It can't be.
I thought they were just a myth.

733
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.333
The Navajo have
a name for their kind. Skinwalker.

734
00:34:10.416 --> 00:34:12.125
I won't live with this curse.

735
00:34:12.208 --> 00:34:14.041
-Hand me my ax.
-Are you sure?

736
00:34:14.125 --> 00:34:15.666
Does my grandfather shit in the woods?

737
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.375
Um. I… Does he? I didn't know him.

738
00:34:18.458 --> 00:34:20.125
It's what we call bears.

739
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
We call bears "grandfather."

740
00:34:23.083 --> 00:34:25.125
Fuck it. just give me my ax!

741
00:34:25.208 --> 00:34:26.500

743
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.916
Whoa. whoa. Geronimo!
What happened? Are you okay?

744
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.333
Go! I'll take care of him.

745
00:34:35.416 --> 00:34:38.208
She's right. he's not important.
Arnold's getting away!

[horse neighs]

747
00:34:39.625 --> 00:34:42.625
No! No. We never leave a man behind.

748
00:34:42.708 --> 00:34:45.500
Edison. dress that wound.
Paul. call your horse.

749
00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.666
Hey. Clyde!

I'm still working on it.
I don't love it. but I don't hate it.

761
00:36:09.833 --> 00:36:13.541
-[Edison] Paul. you were amazing.
-[Paul] Aw. thank you. human lady friend.

762
00:36:13.625 --> 00:36:16.875
And. Sam. your propensity
for murder is extraordinary.

763
00:36:16.958 --> 00:36:20.375
Thank you.
I took murder lessons from John Wick.

-[gasps] The candle maker?
-Yeah!

765

That dude is a fuckin' psycho! [laughs]

766
00:36:25.958 --> 00:36:27.583
Yo. check it. The carriage stopped.

767
00:36:27.666 --> 00:36:29.416
[George] But why would he stop here?

768
00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.833
The road to Delaware!

00:36:36.625 --> 00:36:39.416

He shorted it. Paul.
Hey. Paul. he shorted it.

can support us all!

Did you know that your horse
could swim that fast?

00:37:06.125 --> 00:37:08.500
Oh. yeah. Clyde's a great swimmer.

782
00:37:08.583 --> 00:37:12.166

So proud!

Thank you. Geronimo.
Your hair looks even better wet.

Y'all a bunch of idiots.

786
00:37:21.708 --> 00:37:24.166
[sighs] This feels like the end…

787
00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:26.750
of the first act… of my life.

788
00:37:27.416 --> 00:37:28.791
All hope is lost.

789
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.791
What do we even do now?
Where do we go from here?

790
00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:35.041
[gasps] Where we go isn't the question.

791
00:37:35.125 --> 00:37:37.208
The question is.

792
00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:40.500
do we bring an entree
or a fucking dessert?

793
00:37:43.125 --> 00:37:47.000
[Edison] Oh. guys.
Gettysburg is impossibly vast.

794
00:37:47.083 --> 00:37:50.541
Finding this address
is like finding a needle in a haystack.

795
00:37:50.625 --> 00:37:52.375
Yeah. Edison's right. Let's just give up.

796
00:37:52.458 --> 00:37:55.666
-That is not what I said.
-What? Dudes. look. we tried.

797
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:58.916
One thing. We literally tried one thing.

798
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.958
Yeah. and it didn't work.

799
00:38:01.041 --> 00:38:03.041
-[horn sounds]
-We all got wet. Edison. God!

800
00:38:03.125 --> 00:38:04.666
Look. this isn't fun anymore.

801
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.958
Uh. I can fix that.

802
00:38:07.041 --> 00:38:09.083
Let's get hammered!

803
00:38:09.166 --> 00:38:13.500
Then. fuck it.
we hit the streets mob-rules style.

804
00:38:13.583 --> 00:38:16.458
Anyone we see who doesn't look like us.

805
00:38:16.541 --> 00:38:19.583
they see the bottom of our boots!

806
00:38:19.666 --> 00:38:20.916
Oh. my God.

807
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.041
Okay. fine. no Indians this time.
Ooh. geez.

808
00:38:24.125 --> 00:38:27.333
Oh. my God. I don't know
how many times I have to tell you. Sam.

809
00:38:27.416 --> 00:38:30.500
-This is not India.
-Also. you're a fucking racist.

810
00:38:30.583 --> 00:38:33.166
Uh. no. Paul's the racist.

811
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:35.416
He's the best horse racist
in the colonies.

812
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.333
Yeah. I'm a great racist.

813
00:38:37.416 --> 00:38:38.791
Holy shit.

-Oh. wow. Chief Geronimo!
-Just Geronimo is fine.

818
00:38:51.083 --> 00:38:53.500
-You're the famous renegade tracker.
-Sure.

819
00:38:53.583 --> 00:38:57.166
And [gasps] you're Thomas Edison.
the world-renowned scientist!

820
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:58.541
[scoffs] The same.

821
00:38:58.625 --> 00:39:01.250
Wow. George. the team
is really shaping up nicely.

822
00:39:01.333 --> 00:39:04.208
Oh. no. No. we're not
a team anymore. Martha. We quit.

823
00:39:04.291 --> 00:39:06.458
-What?
-Besides. the revolution was Abe's thing.

824
00:39:06.541 --> 00:39:08.666
I tried to avenge him. but we blew it.

825
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:11.208
Now. we're just gonna jam a bit
and slam some beers.

826
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:12.875
This is a basic blues riff. guys.

827
00:39:12.958 --> 00:39:16.208
Just watch me for the changes.
All right. losers. let's party.

828
00:39:16.291 --> 00:39:20.333
No! George Bon Jovi Washington.
you do not get to party.

829
00:39:20.416 --> 00:39:22.833
-What?
-Would Abe want to party right now?

830
00:39:22.916 --> 00:39:24.375
Abe never wanted to party.

831
00:39:24.458 --> 00:39:28.583
Because he had goals. unrealized dreams.

832
00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:31.791
But you bet your ass
once those dreams were realized.

833
00:39:31.875 --> 00:39:34.791
he would've snorted a line
as long as the Magna Carta.

834
00:39:34.875 --> 00:39:37.375
Really? No. Abe? My Abe?

835
00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:39.208
Are you kidding? With that head?

836
00:39:39.291 --> 00:39:44.208
[laughs] Dude was all sinus.
He was made for the marching powder.

837
00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:45.500
Not how cocaine works.

838
00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:48.708
Now. those goals are your goals.

839
00:39:48.791 --> 00:39:52.666
Those unrealized dreams
are your unrealized dreams.

840
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:55.125
That's the promise that you made. right?

841
00:39:55.208 --> 00:39:57.541
So. achieve those goals.

842
00:39:57.625 --> 00:39:59.458
Realize those dreams.

843
00:39:59.541 --> 00:40:03.333
And then. you can party
like a rich white man

844
00:40:03.416 --> 00:40:08.291
who will never face adversity
for the rest of his glorious life!

845
00:40:08.958 --> 00:40:11.416
You're right. I have to earn it.

846
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.625
That is what Abe would want.

847
00:40:13.708 --> 00:40:16.291
that insane coke-hound! [chuckles]

848
00:40:16.375 --> 00:40:18.041
Guys. I've thought about it.

849
00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:20.166
I'm willing to give it another shot
if you are.

850
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:21.541
-What do you say?
-Sure. man.

851
00:40:21.625 --> 00:40:22.750
Um. you're the one who quit.

852
00:40:22.833 --> 00:40:26.458
If we can find Arnold. we can force
the Gettysburg Address out of him.

853
00:40:26.541 --> 00:40:29.750
Oh. I'm sorry.
did none of you notice my fucking arm?

854
00:40:29.833 --> 00:40:32.000
Benedict Arnold is a werewolf!

855
00:40:32.625 --> 00:40:34.416
In some cultures. known as a skinwalker.

856
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.833
He ain't givin' up shit unless
he thinks we're an actual threat to him.

857
00:40:37.916 --> 00:40:39.666
The only way to be
an actual threat to him--

858
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:42.041
Is if we have a silver bullet.

859
00:40:42.125 --> 00:40:44.333
-Exactly.
-Wait. what are we doing again?

860
00:40:44.416 --> 00:40:47.125
A silver bullet?
Who could ever even make such a thing?

861
00:40:47.208 --> 00:40:48.458
I know a blacksmith.

862
00:40:48.541 --> 00:40:51.458
He made this armor
and I've never taken it off.

863
00:40:51.541 --> 00:40:54.291
Okay. Okay! We'll visit this blacksmith

864
00:40:54.375 --> 00:40:58.208
and he will discover the secret
of the impossible weapon we require.

865
00:40:58.291 --> 00:41:00.083
Because our cause is just!

866
00:41:00.166 --> 00:41:01.416
It is righteous!

867
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.916
It is His will! His and Abe's!

868
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.583
-And the Earth Mother's.
-Nope.

869
00:41:05.666 --> 00:41:07.625
-And Isaac Newton's.
-Nope. Just God's.

870
00:41:07.708 --> 00:41:10.041
I hold these truths to be self-evident.

871
00:41:10.125 --> 00:41:12.208
All for one and one for all!

872
00:41:12.291 --> 00:41:14.500
We will find the Gettysburg Address.

873
00:41:14.583 --> 00:41:15.708
[all] Huzzah!

874
00:41:15.791 --> 00:41:17.708
[Paul] Huzzah! Nope. too late.

875
00:41:19.833 --> 00:41:21.166
[clanking]

876
00:41:21.875 --> 00:41:22.708
[grunts]

877
00:41:22.791 --> 00:41:24.166
[hisses]

878
00:41:32.083 --> 00:41:35.041
-Smittay!
-[bell chimes]

879
00:41:37.083 --> 00:41:39.166
Damn! Fuck my life.

880
00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:40.708
We're friends.

881
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:42.833
[birds chirping]

882
00:41:43.875 --> 00:41:46.166
Do I even wanna know
why you need a silver bullet?

883
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.041
Best that you not know. Mr. Smith.

884
00:41:48.125 --> 00:41:49.666
Why do you keep calling me Mr. Smith?

885
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.041
Well. Revere called you Black Smith.

886
00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:55.125
-Right. because I'm a blacksmith.
-Right. A Black Smith.

887
00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:56.750
-A blacksmith.
-Black Smith.

888
00:41:56.833 --> 00:41:58.750
I'm a smith who works with metal.

889
00:41:58.833 --> 00:42:02.833
which oxidizes during
the heating process and turns black.

890
00:42:02.916 --> 00:42:05.500
-So. you're a Smith.
-Exactly.

891
00:42:05.583 --> 00:42:07.083
-Of the Baltimore Smiths?
-[sighs]

892
00:42:07.166 --> 00:42:08.750
Just tell me what you need it for.

893
00:42:08.833 --> 00:42:11.500
It'll be used to free the colonies.
Let's just leave it at that.

894
00:42:11.583 --> 00:42:14.250
Oh. you're talking about the Brits.

895
00:42:14.333 --> 00:42:17.416
Shit. why didn't you say so?
I'm definitely down for that.

896
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.208
-You are?
-Fuck. yeah!

897
00:42:19.291 --> 00:42:20.833
I mean. don't get it twisted.

898
00:42:20.916 --> 00:42:23.291
I definitely do not trust
you motherfuckers.

899
00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:25.125
You three. especially.

900
00:42:25.208 --> 00:42:27.375
But fuck. man. I hate the British.

901
00:42:27.458 --> 00:42:29.250
Why. what have the fun police done to you?

902
00:42:29.333 --> 00:42:31.416
Look around. I'm a small business owner.

903
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.208
What's a small business owner's
greatest enemy?

904
00:42:34.291 --> 00:42:36.041
-Large businesses?
-Thin profit margins?

905
00:42:36.125 --> 00:42:38.708
-Rising lube costs?
-White people stealing everything you own.

906
00:42:38.958 --> 00:42:40.666
-Having a squirrel for a friend?
-No.

907
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.458
-Staff turnover?
-Tesla being a bitch?

908
00:42:42.541 --> 00:42:46.125
-Not getting drunk at lunch?
-White people stealing everything you own.

909
00:42:46.208 --> 00:42:47.708
Constant instinct to second-guess

910
00:42:47.791 --> 00:42:50.250
having risked your savings
on unproven business acumen?

911
00:42:50.333 --> 00:42:53.041
-No. it's taxes.
-Taxes. Correct.

912
00:42:53.125 --> 00:42:56.791
Small business taxes. And what's
the big knock against the British?

913
00:42:56.875 --> 00:42:59.125
-Something about taxation!
-Exactly.

914
00:42:59.208 --> 00:43:01.875
You'll help us? You'll craft
the silver bullet free of charge?

915
00:43:01.958 --> 00:43:04.250
What? Are you white motherfuckers crazy?

916
00:43:04.333 --> 00:43:07.000
I just told you
I'm a small business owner.

917
00:43:07.083 --> 00:43:09.625
You think I'm gonna
give you silver for free?

918
00:43:09.708 --> 00:43:11.291
Well. we don't have silver.

919
00:43:11.375 --> 00:43:13.333
The British seized it all
when they got here--

920
00:43:13.416 --> 00:43:16.625
Spoons. Teaspoons. I remember.

921
00:43:16.708 --> 00:43:18.750
Why do you think that shit's so expensive?

922
00:43:18.833 --> 00:43:21.875
Okay. Well. how much
do we need for. like. one bullet?

923
00:43:21.958 --> 00:43:24.333
-A metric shit-ton.
-For one bullet?

924
00:43:24.416 --> 00:43:28.000
Oh. I'm sorry.
Are you a fucking metallurgist like me?

925
00:43:28.083 --> 00:43:30.458
-That's. like. a thousand spoons!
-Three thousand.

926
00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:32.500
It's a metric shit-ton.

927
00:43:32.583 --> 00:43:35.541
Where are we gonna get
3.000 spoons overnight. bro?

928
00:43:35.625 --> 00:43:36.458
Well…

929
00:43:36.541 --> 00:43:39.166
[ship horn sounds]

930
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.083
[blacksmith] May I present.
the year's biggest tea party.

931
00:43:42.166 --> 00:43:45.041
You need silver spoons.
you need to get aboard that ship.

932
00:43:45.125 --> 00:43:47.458
Wait a minute.
How did you know about this?

933
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.916
[Samuel] What's up with
these assholes and flyers?

934
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.458
Well. it's a great way to communicate
with a widespread audience.

935
00:43:54.541 --> 00:43:58.208
much like direct mail or the Pony Express.
where my brother does not work.

936
00:43:58.291 --> 00:44:01.625
-[grunts] All right. Shall we?
-Wait. wait. wait. Wait!

937
00:44:04.166 --> 00:44:05.625
-We need a plan.
-Why?

938
00:44:05.708 --> 00:44:08.583
Well. last time we didn't have one
and things got shitty.

939
00:44:08.666 --> 00:44:10.333
-Huh?
-Yeah. Geronimo lost his arm.

940
00:44:10.416 --> 00:44:13.916
-No. he lost like three-fifths of an arm.
-[scoffs] Seriously?

941
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.958
Oh. thoughts and prayers.

942
00:44:16.041 --> 00:44:19.250
Look. good leaders like Abe
have a plan for everything.

943
00:44:19.333 --> 00:44:21.875
-All right. His Leadership. let's hear it.
-Okay.

944
00:44:21.958 --> 00:44:24.583
So. Mr. Smith. you'll be the lookout.

945
00:44:24.666 --> 00:44:26.791
-[blacksmith laughs] Nope.
-What?

946
00:44:26.875 --> 00:44:31.083
You want me. a Black dude.
to sit here in the dark. alone.

947
00:44:31.166 --> 00:44:33.458
to play lookout for you
while you break the law?

948
00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:37.500
Oh. hell no! I hate the British
but I ain't lookin' to get killed.

949
00:44:37.583 --> 00:44:40.458
So. y'all are on your own
to get that silver.

950
00:44:40.541 --> 00:44:42.875
But if you do get it.
I'll make your little bullet.

951
00:44:42.958 --> 00:44:45.041
All right. Then…

952
00:44:45.125 --> 00:44:46.375
here's the plan.

953
00:44:46.458 --> 00:44:50.416
Geronimo. you'll be the lookout.
Are you cool with being the lookout?

954
00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.958
I mean. if my choice is to be the lookout

955
00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:56.666
or have one of you looking out for me.
yeah. I'll be the lookout.

956
00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.708
Great. Okay. Edison. you'll pose as
the wife of an officer already on board.

957
00:45:00.791 --> 00:45:04.833
[groans] This is taking too long.
Let's just dress as those guys.

958
00:45:04.916 --> 00:45:07.375
[all] Ello. guv.

959
00:45:07.458 --> 00:45:09.833
Well. technically. that is a plan.

960
00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:14.000
Just technically. a very bad plan.

961
00:45:14.083 --> 00:45:18.916
Ha! I told you a jail would be
a better use of space than lifeboats.

962
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.208
Hey. at least we got on board.
right. guys?

963
00:45:21.291 --> 00:45:24.250
I consider this mission accomplished.
Ooh. we should get a banner.

964
00:45:24.333 --> 00:45:28.375
Ugh. shockingly. Sam's not wrong.
We can still make this work.

965
00:45:28.458 --> 00:45:30.666
I've taken note
of how often the guards go on rounds.

966
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.666
-If we lay low for a few hours--
-No!

967
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:34.875
Enough with all of the planning!

968
00:45:34.958 --> 00:45:38.125
Did Magellan have a plan
when he circumnavigated the globe?

969
00:45:38.208 --> 00:45:39.333
-[all] No!
-[Edison] Yes.

970
00:45:39.416 --> 00:45:40.750
That took a lot of preparation.

971
00:45:40.833 --> 00:45:46.000
We'll set our course for freedom
using only our wits as our guide.

972
00:45:46.083 --> 00:45:48.916
Mr. Revere. tear down that wall.

973
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.458
[Paul] Whee!

974
00:45:53.958 --> 00:45:55.333
What is this place?

975
00:45:55.416 --> 00:45:57.666
I don't know. but don't touch any--

976
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:58.958
Ooh. oops.

977
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:14.416
They're steeping the colonists in tea!

978
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:18.041
Turning them British.
James. you sick bastard!

979
00:46:18.125 --> 00:46:20.541
Look. as far as I can tell.
this is a test run.

980
00:46:20.625 --> 00:46:23.375
James is up to something bigger
than crushing the revolution.

981
00:46:23.458 --> 00:46:25.916
Maybe even…
Oh. fuck! I don't even want to say it!

982
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.750
-Just say it.
-Something global.

983
00:46:27.833 --> 00:46:28.708
[all gasp]

984
00:46:28.791 --> 00:46:31.750
-That means…
-There are global stakes now.

985
00:46:31.833 --> 00:46:34.416
Good God!
Can you figure out what he's planning?

986
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.291
Yeah. I think I can.
If I can just hack the mainframe.

987
00:46:37.375 --> 00:46:40.125
Great. Guys. gather as many
silver spoons as you can.

988
00:46:40.208 --> 00:46:44.291
In the meantime. I'll get these
hardworking Americans out of these tubes!

989
00:46:44.375 --> 00:46:45.625
[Edison] George! No!

990
00:46:46.541 --> 00:46:50.708
No! I had almost downloaded the plan.

991
00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:53.333
-Uh. guys. we gotta go.
-Yep.

992
00:46:53.416 --> 00:46:56.000
Totally right.
Grab spoons. guys. Quick. let's go.

993
00:46:57.166 --> 00:46:58.833
[exploding]

994
00:47:01.666 --> 00:47:03.000
[indistinct shouting]

995
00:47:05.416 --> 00:47:06.750
[screams]

996
00:47:09.958 --> 00:47:12.708
-[Paul] Oh. no.
-Oh. my God. the humanity.

997
00:47:12.791 --> 00:47:15.083
This is bad. This is so bad.

998
00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:16.916
Those poor boat people.

999
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.708
Look. if anybody asks.
the Titanic hit an iceberg.

1000
00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:23.250
We were never here. baby.

1001
00:47:27.333 --> 00:47:28.666
[sighs]

1002
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:31.791
It's hopeless. Martha.
At this rate. I'll never avenge Abe.

1003
00:47:31.875 --> 00:47:33.708
And see his dream through. don't forget.

1004
00:47:33.791 --> 00:47:36.458
-That's the whole second part.
-I tried.

1005
00:47:36.541 --> 00:47:40.375
I tried to be a leader like him. Martha.
It's just not working.

1006
00:47:40.458 --> 00:47:43.666
Oh. George. Abe was a great leader.
but you can't copy him.

1007
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:46.458
You must find
your own style of leadership.

1008
00:47:46.541 --> 00:47:50.583
Maybe something with less planning.
Something more free-spirited. like you.

1009
00:47:50.666 --> 00:47:53.333
I know. I just wish
I realized that before we…

1010
00:47:53.416 --> 00:47:56.458
Before the Titanic hit that iceberg.

1011
00:47:56.541 --> 00:47:58.333
Yes. What a tragedy.

1012
00:47:58.416 --> 00:48:00.416
Right? Such a tragedy!

1013
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:05.333
It feels like. for every step forward.
we just take two steps back. John 3:16.

1014
00:48:05.416 --> 00:48:09.041
Then. let's focus on the positive. huh?
What was tonight's step forward?

1015
00:48:09.125 --> 00:48:10.875
-I got these spoons.
-[spoons jingling]

1016
00:48:10.958 --> 00:48:14.291
Oh. that's great. George.
And are they. like. for something?

1017
00:48:14.375 --> 00:48:17.875
Yeah. but they're still useless
without the Gettysburg Address.

1018
00:48:17.958 --> 00:48:21.041
[sighs] The tirelessness
with which you've pursued your quest

1019
00:48:21.125 --> 00:48:23.000
has betrayed your confidence in it.

1020
00:48:23.083 --> 00:48:25.333
Perhaps a quick HJ to help you sleep.

1021
00:48:25.416 --> 00:48:27.583
Generous. but I need to earn it.

1022
00:48:27.666 --> 00:48:29.250
Then. for now. rest. my love.

1023
00:48:29.333 --> 00:48:32.083
Clear your head.
It's always darkest before the dawn.

1024
00:48:32.166 --> 00:48:35.083
-John 3:16?
-I don't think so. champ.

1025
00:48:35.958 --> 00:48:38.250
For now. rest. my love. Clear your head.

1026
00:48:38.333 --> 00:48:40.250
It's always darkest before the dawn.

1027
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:42.208
[gasps]

1028
00:48:42.291 --> 00:48:43.750
Where am I?

1029
00:48:43.833 --> 00:48:45.875
[Abe] Don't worry. George. You're safe.

1030
00:48:45.958 --> 00:48:49.708
Abe? Abe. is that you?
I can't see. Everything's so bright.

1031
00:48:49.791 --> 00:48:53.333
Oh. that's me. Sorry. I was trying
to make this seem more impressive.

1032
00:48:53.833 --> 00:48:56.708
It's great to see you. Abe.
But what is this place?

1033
00:48:56.791 --> 00:48:59.833
[echoing] It's your dream world. George.

1034
00:48:59.916 --> 00:49:00.958
Is it?

1035
00:49:01.041 --> 00:49:04.583
Can I ask a question. real quick?
Why is my dream world so shitty?

1036
00:49:04.666 --> 00:49:07.041
[chuckles] Well. we ran out of money.

1037
00:49:07.125 --> 00:49:08.666
-My dream ran out of money?
-Sure.

1038
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:12.500
Yeah. Look. I've been told by the.
you know. "dream producers."

1039
00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:15.291
that we could use this money
more effectively elsewhere.

1040
00:49:15.375 --> 00:49:19.875
Like in an epic ending battle happening
sometime in the next 30 minutes or so.

1041
00:49:19.958 --> 00:49:21.583
Okay. well. what were you gonna do?

1042
00:49:21.666 --> 00:49:23.708
Oh. I had this whole idea worked out.

1043
00:49:23.791 --> 00:49:26.500
-You were gonna fight a dream-hydra.
-Whoa. that's cool.

1044
00:49:26.583 --> 00:49:29.875
I know. And it was made up
of all of King James' rules.

1045
00:49:29.958 --> 00:49:32.375
And for every rule you cut down.
another appeared.

1046
00:49:32.458 --> 00:49:33.708
-Rah!
-[George] Ooh!

1047
00:49:33.791 --> 00:49:35.958
-That's a nice metaphor. dude!
-Thanks. bro.

1048
00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:37.958
And it was all about how the revolution

1049
00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:40.958
is about more
than just breaking the king's rules.

1050
00:49:41.041 --> 00:49:43.000
It's also about your son.

1051
00:49:43.083 --> 00:49:46.083
-What? I'm havin' a boy?
-[laughs] Yeah!

1052
00:49:46.166 --> 00:49:49.208
Boom! Sex. bitch! Oh. shit! Yeah!

1053
00:49:49.291 --> 00:49:51.083
Either way would be cool. Girls are cool.

1054
00:49:51.166 --> 00:49:54.500
Yeah. Yeah. it's a son. though.
He's the future.

1055
00:49:54.583 --> 00:49:57.875
Him and all the sons
and daughters of this great nation.

1056
00:49:57.958 --> 00:50:01.041
no matter what they look like
or where they come from.

1057
00:50:01.125 --> 00:50:03.250
Be a leader for them. George.

1058
00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:05.291
A leader for all people!

1059
00:50:05.375 --> 00:50:07.666
I get it. I get it. Abe.

1060
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:09.416
But I would've got it a lot better

1061
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.666
if I was kicking an ass
of a giant dream-hydra.

1062
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:13.666
but I'm just saying. I get it. I got it.

1063
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:15.458
Agreed. But don't worry. George.

1064
00:50:15.541 --> 00:50:17.333
There's plenty of fighting left to do.

1065
00:50:17.416 --> 00:50:18.750
Oh. and one more thing.

1066
00:50:18.833 --> 00:50:21.125
What is it. old chum?
You can tell me anything.

1067
00:50:21.208 --> 00:50:24.166
When your wife
offers you a hand job. you take it.

1068
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:25.750
-[Martha] George!
-Martha!

1069
00:50:25.833 --> 00:50:28.333
-[groans] George!
-Martha!

1070
00:50:28.416 --> 00:50:31.000
Oh. don't worry about her. Georgie.

1071
00:50:31.083 --> 00:50:35.583
She'll be quite not well taken care of.
if you catch my drift.

1072
00:50:35.666 --> 00:50:39.291
I don't. But you were on the Titanic.
You should be dead.

1073
00:50:39.375 --> 00:50:41.916
I mean. I heard you were on the Titanic.

1074
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.416
That's what I heard
from someone who was there.

1075
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:47.666
while I was here… reading… this book.

1076
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:48.875
The Graps of Wreath.

1077
00:50:48.958 --> 00:50:51.250
Yes. well.
I'm an excellent swimmer. dickhead.

1078
00:50:51.333 --> 00:50:53.000
You should've done your research.

1079
00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.166
Thanks for the tip.

1080
00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:56.333
When Edison invents
the Internet next year.

1081
00:50:56.416 --> 00:50:59.708
I'll make sure
to edit your Wikipedia page myself.

1082
00:50:59.791 --> 00:51:05.500
"Benedict Arnold. great swimmer
and a total fucking asswipe."

1083
00:51:05.583 --> 00:51:07.458
Well. I'll just change it back.

1084
00:51:07.541 --> 00:51:10.083
No. you won't. because you'll be dead!

1085
00:51:10.166 --> 00:51:12.000
-[motor sputters]
-Huh?

1086
00:51:12.125 --> 00:51:13.041
What?

1087
00:51:13.125 --> 00:51:15.458
Well. maybe
after she invents the Internet.

1088
00:51:15.541 --> 00:51:20.125
your friend Edison can invent chainsaws
that don't require gasoline. [laughs]

1089
00:51:20.208 --> 00:51:25.458
You sucked the gas out
of my arm chainsaws while I was sleeping?

1090
00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:28.958
Jesus Christ.
what kind of psychopath are you?

1091
00:51:29.041 --> 00:51:31.375
The worst kind.

1092
00:51:31.875 --> 00:51:33.208
Whatever you take that to mean.

1093
00:51:33.291 --> 00:51:35.208
Take her to the Gettysburg Address.

1094
00:51:35.291 --> 00:51:36.958
-[Martha] George. no!
-Martha!

1095
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:40.583
Oh. my. Georgie.
I just realized we woke you up.

1096
00:51:41.166 --> 00:51:44.458
-Please allow us to recompense.
-[grunts]

1097
00:51:46.416 --> 00:51:49.458
[Paul] Last night was bad news.
human friends.

1098
00:51:49.541 --> 00:51:53.750
Yeah. bad news for the fun police.
Eat a dick. Titanic!

1099
00:51:53.833 --> 00:51:56.875
-[laughs]
-Right! Yes! Cool. cool. cool.

1100
00:51:56.958 --> 00:52:01.125
And I guess the entire harbor ecosystem
can just eat a dick. too. right?

1101
00:52:01.208 --> 00:52:04.583
I mean… Yes. 100%.

1102
00:52:04.666 --> 00:52:08.958
Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm!

1103
00:52:09.041 --> 00:52:10.500
-Are you okay?
-George! What is it?

1104
00:52:10.583 --> 00:52:12.000
Arnold kidnapped Martha!

1105
00:52:12.083 --> 00:52:14.083
-Oh. no!
-It sucks when they steal your wife!

1106
00:52:14.166 --> 00:52:15.250
And she's pregnant!

1107
00:52:15.333 --> 00:52:17.333
-What?
-Congratulations. that's a beautiful gift!

1108
00:52:17.416 --> 00:52:19.791
Thanks! I'm sorry
this is how I'm telling you.

1109
00:52:19.875 --> 00:52:21.458
but we appreciate your support!

1110
00:52:21.541 --> 00:52:23.458
We're already
on waiting lists for preschool.

1111
00:52:23.541 --> 00:52:26.875
Hey. man. Maybe you need
to take some time for yourself.

1112
00:52:26.958 --> 00:52:28.916
It's a lot. emotionally. I would know.

1113
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.583
No. that's exactly what I don't need.

1114
00:52:31.666 --> 00:52:34.375
The old George
would just party these woes away.

1115
00:52:34.458 --> 00:52:37.833
But not me.
This just adds fuel to my fuckin' fire.

1116
00:52:37.916 --> 00:52:39.291
Hell yeah. man!

1117
00:52:39.375 --> 00:52:41.541
Ben said he's keeping her
at the Gettysburg Address.

1118
00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:44.791
Which we still don't have.
George. I'm sorry to say.

1119
00:52:44.875 --> 00:52:46.958
but we've tried
everything to crack this code.

1120
00:52:47.041 --> 00:52:49.208
-Code…
-I don't know what else we can do.

1121
00:52:50.208 --> 00:52:52.958
-Code… Oh! Holy shit!
-What?

1122
00:52:53.041 --> 00:52:54.416
[George] Not many people know this.

1123
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.666
but Abe wasn't
just America's premier celebrity chef.

1124
00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:00.250
He was also
its most capable cryptographer.

1125
00:53:00.333 --> 00:53:01.458
Plip-plopipher?

1126
00:53:01.541 --> 00:53:05.250
Cryptographer. You know. someone
who crafts and solves codes and ciphers.

1127
00:53:05.333 --> 00:53:06.875
[chuckling] Yeah. a plip-plopipher.

1128
00:53:06.958 --> 00:53:09.958
That's what I said.
We're saying the same thing.

1129
00:53:10.041 --> 00:53:13.125
Exactly. Which means
that Abe's final edict.

1130
00:53:13.208 --> 00:53:18.291
that I name our freed country America.
was itself likely a cipher.

1131
00:53:18.375 --> 00:53:21.791
Hidden within the words
of America. my friends.

1132
00:53:21.875 --> 00:53:24.500
is the Gettysburg Address.

1133
00:53:24.583 --> 00:53:26.625
I don't know. seems like kind of a leap.

1134
00:53:26.708 --> 00:53:28.875
But I'll need some time to crack the code.

1135
00:53:28.958 --> 00:53:31.583
In the meantime. someone must
run the spoons to Black Smith.

1136
00:53:31.666 --> 00:53:33.375
[all at once] Not it!

1137
00:53:33.458 --> 00:53:36.500
-All right. Chief. that's you.
-What the fuck just happened?

1138
00:53:36.583 --> 00:53:39.833
Did I just lose a game that
white people didn't explain the rules to?

1139
00:53:39.916 --> 00:53:41.666
I can't carry all the silver.

1140
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:44.958
-I only got the one arm.
-[laughing] And whose fault is that?

1141
00:53:45.041 --> 00:53:47.625
That would be yours.
For screwing up Vietnam.

1142
00:53:47.708 --> 00:53:51.250
What are you talking about?
We won Vietnam.

1143
00:53:51.333 --> 00:53:55.958
[sighs] Actually. if it gives me some time
away from you. yeah. I'll do it.

1144
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:59.666
-You are a good man. Chief Geronimo.
-[Geronimo] Just Geronimo.

1145
00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:01.125
The rest of you. come with me.

1146
00:54:01.208 --> 00:54:03.916
I know the perfect place
to work on Abe's cipher.

1147
00:54:08.583 --> 00:54:10.333
Ugh. come on.

1148
00:54:15.166 --> 00:54:17.083
[King James] You left Washington alive.

1149
00:54:17.166 --> 00:54:20.458
[Benedict] Uh. yes.
a calculated risk. my liege.

1150
00:54:20.541 --> 00:54:22.291
Instead of trimming one thorn.

1151
00:54:22.375 --> 00:54:25.916
we may soon be in position
to wipe out the whole damn bush.

1152
00:54:27.666 --> 00:54:29.666
[King James] And kidnapping his wife?

1153
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:32.250
You're not worried that will motivate him?

1154
00:54:32.333 --> 00:54:34.375
Oh. I'm counting on it.

1155
00:54:34.458 --> 00:54:38.250
Still. we should expedite my… Your plan.

1156
00:54:38.333 --> 00:54:41.500
Very well. Send me the head engineer.

1157
00:54:43.708 --> 00:54:45.458
You wanted to see me. Your Majesty?

1158
00:54:45.541 --> 00:54:48.250
There's been a slight change of plan.

1159
00:54:48.333 --> 00:54:51.791
We'll need my weapon operational
sooner than anticipated.

1160
00:54:51.875 --> 00:54:53.500
How much sooner. Your Majesty?

1161
00:54:53.583 --> 00:54:55.166
You tell me.

1162
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:56.916
If we work around the clock.

1163
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.041
we could probably
have it ready in three weeks?

1164
00:55:02.625 --> 00:55:05.416
-[gulps]
-[whistle blows]

1165
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:08.958
Please. Your Majesty. Your Highness.
I can do it faster.

1166
00:55:12.166 --> 00:55:14.291
Ah. thank God.

1167
00:55:16.166 --> 00:55:18.625
-[gasps]
-[shrieks]

1168
00:55:19.958 --> 00:55:21.125
My foot!

1169
00:55:21.208 --> 00:55:22.625
Most impressive.

1170
00:55:22.708 --> 00:55:24.916
[screams]

1171
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.666
Manchester. come to Daddy.

1172
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:29.541
Oh. look at the good boy.

1173
00:55:29.666 --> 00:55:32.416
Oh. look. you have
a little engineer on your face.

1174
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.250
Well. I guess I do. too. now.

1175
00:55:34.333 --> 00:55:37.291
Don't I? Don't I? Yes!

1176
00:55:37.375 --> 00:55:39.208
-[kisses]
-Uh. okay.

1177
00:55:39.291 --> 00:55:42.083
I'll have Engineering
redouble their efforts.

1178
00:55:42.166 --> 00:55:44.125
See that you do. Arnold.

1179
00:55:44.208 --> 00:55:46.541
Whether or not you succeed with your plan.

1180
00:55:46.625 --> 00:55:48.875
and in case it wasn't clear.
I'm not holding my breath.

1181
00:55:48.958 --> 00:55:51.041
Washington is now marching inexorably

1182
00:55:51.125 --> 00:55:54.083
into the gnashing maw
of the most diabolical war machine

1183
00:55:54.166 --> 00:55:55.666
the world has ever known.

1184
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:58.458
And he doesn't even see it coming.

1185
00:55:58.541 --> 00:56:02.125
-[laughs maniacally]
-Yes. They never do.

1186
00:56:04.166 --> 00:56:08.208
Uh. George? I thought you said
you had a safe place to work.

1187
00:56:08.291 --> 00:56:10.833
-What? This looks good to me.
-Thank you. Paul.

1188
00:56:10.916 --> 00:56:14.291
But this isn't the place I had in mind.
That is.

1189
00:56:14.375 --> 00:56:16.541
-[all exclaim]
-[Paul] It got even better!

1190
00:56:18.583 --> 00:56:20.625
[George] Abe. I'm home.

1191
00:56:21.416 --> 00:56:24.291
-[hisses]
-[exclaims] Pardon me. ma'am.

1192
00:56:27.958 --> 00:56:31.375
Oh. my gord. horse toys! Whee!

1193
00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:42.541
George?

1194
00:56:42.625 --> 00:56:44.416
-George. are you okay. buddy?
-[sniffles]

1195
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:45.833
Yes. I am.

1196
00:56:45.916 --> 00:56:48.666
But I need to be one with Abe now.

1197
00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:52.541
I have to get inside of his head
if I hope to crack this code.

1198
00:56:53.833 --> 00:56:55.000
Okay.

1199
00:56:56.958 --> 00:56:57.875
Come on. come on!

1200
00:56:59.625 --> 00:57:01.166
Confirm! Please confirm!

1201
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:03.000
We are cruisin'!

1202
00:57:03.833 --> 00:57:05.625
Oh. yeah! [chuckles]

1203
00:57:08.125 --> 00:57:10.750
Next and next. Next. Too easy.

1204
00:57:10.833 --> 00:57:14.333
No. no. don't. No. no. Yes!
Reset 30%. please!

1205
00:57:14.416 --> 00:57:16.000
Fuck no! I'm fucked.

1206
00:57:16.333 --> 00:57:17.208
No. fuck!

1207
00:57:19.083 --> 00:57:21.375
I am rusty. rusty.

1208
00:57:21.458 --> 00:57:24.333
Okay. at the hands of this guy is you.

1209
00:57:25.125 --> 00:57:26.250
Eternal destruction.

1210
00:57:27.541 --> 00:57:29.041
Quick. quick. quick! Thank you.

1211
00:57:29.125 --> 00:57:30.958
Return. Return. Yes!

1212
00:57:31.041 --> 00:57:33.208
Three. two. one. Go!

1213
00:57:33.291 --> 00:57:34.500
Come on. Yeah!

1214
00:57:35.291 --> 00:57:37.000
Whoo! Yeah!

1215
00:57:37.083 --> 00:57:38.458
You've been hacked. bro!

1216
00:57:42.083 --> 00:57:45.000
So. what are you going to do
when this is all over. huh?

1217
00:57:45.083 --> 00:57:46.458
You got family somewhere?

1218
00:57:46.541 --> 00:57:47.750
Clyde is my family.

1219
00:57:47.833 --> 00:57:51.416
No. I know. but like.
you know. people family. friends?

1220
00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.000
That's why I'm doing this.

1221
00:57:53.083 --> 00:57:57.541
You started a war against the most
powerful country on Earth to make friends?

1222
00:57:57.625 --> 00:58:00.541
Yes. Yes. I did.
I never had people friends.

1223
00:58:00.625 --> 00:58:02.541
Oh. Paul. You have one now.

1224
00:58:02.625 --> 00:58:04.666
Thank you. Why do you wanna make war?

1225
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:07.916
They're mean to you
and they disrespect you. like a mule.

1226
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.916
Well. George means well.

1227
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.083
Sam disrespects me. but he's an idiot.

1228
00:58:12.166 --> 00:58:15.666
Listen. lions don't concern themselves
with the opinions of sheep.

1229
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:20.000
Well. I'm friends with a lot of sheep
and. boy. are they opinionated.

1230
00:58:20.083 --> 00:58:22.500
-Oh. I just meant--
-[mimics sheep bleating]

1231
00:58:22.583 --> 00:58:23.625
That's how sheep talk.

1232
00:58:23.708 --> 00:58:27.125
Look. I'm doing this
because I want science for everyone.

1233
00:58:27.208 --> 00:58:30.791
Without fear of punishment
or persecution or even judgment.

1234
00:58:30.875 --> 00:58:33.375
Problem is.
the rich white assholes that run the joint

1235
00:58:33.458 --> 00:58:36.000
keep telling everyone
that science isn't real.

1236
00:58:36.083 --> 00:58:38.375
So. I'm gonna show 'em.

1237
00:58:38.458 --> 00:58:41.708
I'm gonna show the whole
damn world that science is real.

1238
00:58:41.791 --> 00:58:43.208
How are you gonna do that?

1239
00:58:43.291 --> 00:58:45.666
By using it to do something
that no one can ignore.

1240
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:50.083
-I'm going to use science to win a war.
-Oh!

1241
00:58:50.166 --> 00:58:51.750
I don't know how I'm gonna do it yet.

1242
00:58:51.833 --> 00:58:56.125
But all it takes is one great invention
deployed at the perfect time.

1243
00:58:56.208 --> 00:58:59.083
and then.
the whole world will yell at once--

1244
00:58:59.166 --> 00:59:01.958
-[door slams open]
-Eur-goddamn-reka!

1245
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:05.916
…at which point. I was reminded
of one of Abe's favorite exploits.

1246
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.958
After a reverse hash.
I backdoored the root password.

1247
00:59:09.041 --> 00:59:11.250
A base checksum
against the main data store

1248
00:59:11.333 --> 00:59:13.208
allowed me to retrieve the salted hash.

1249
00:59:13.291 --> 00:59:16.291
and then. from there.
I was gleaming the cube.

1250
00:59:16.375 --> 00:59:18.125
George. this is amazing!

1251
00:59:18.208 --> 00:59:19.666
You haven't even heard the kicker.

1252
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:22.458
When I extrapolated through
a dual node minimum spanning tree.

1253
00:59:22.541 --> 00:59:25.125
the cipher's definition revealed itself.

1254
00:59:25.208 --> 00:59:27.791
"A" is the first letter of the alphabet.

1255
00:59:27.875 --> 00:59:31.541
which means it is letter number one.

1256
00:59:31.625 --> 00:59:33.791
Therefore. "A" equals one.

1257
00:59:33.875 --> 00:59:36.125
-Yeah. I understand all of this.
-Oh!

1258
00:59:36.208 --> 00:59:38.958
And if "A" equals one. then--

1259
00:59:39.041 --> 00:59:41.375
-You've got to be kidding me!
-Both of us.

1260
00:59:41.458 --> 00:59:45.083
I am not. America equals "1 Merica."

1261
00:59:45.166 --> 00:59:48.125
Now. does that word "Merica"
ring a bell to any of you?

1262
00:59:48.208 --> 00:59:50.500
Oh! Oh! I know! Fuck. I lost it.

1263
00:59:50.583 --> 00:59:52.208
Ooh. no. Does it start with a one?

1264
00:59:52.291 --> 00:59:54.000
Maybe this will jog your memory.

1265
00:59:54.083 --> 00:59:57.083
This is ten times magnification.

1266
00:59:57.166 --> 00:59:59.083
Oh. my God.

1267
00:59:59.166 --> 01:00:04.208
[George] Gentlemen. lady.
I give you the Gettysburg Address.

1268
01:00:04.791 --> 01:00:05.666
[Samuel] Oof!

1269
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:10.333
Oh. I guess we… I guess we
should've scouted the area. right. guys?

1270
01:00:10.416 --> 01:00:14.041
But then we wouldn't have had George's
awesome code-cracking scene. right?

1271
01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:16.083
Really? You thought that was awesome?

1272
01:00:16.166 --> 01:00:18.250
It wasn't. you know. too indulgent?

1273
01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:21.083
No way. dude. Totally realistic.

1274
01:00:21.166 --> 01:00:22.541
And entirely too short.

1275
01:00:22.625 --> 01:00:25.375
Guys. you have got to see this. Look.

1276
01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:26.750
Whoa!

1277
01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:27.875
[Samuel] What do you see?

1278
01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:30.208
[George] Redcoats standing around a table.

1279
01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:33.583
And there's only one reason
grown men would stand around a table.

1280
01:00:33.666 --> 01:00:35.208
-To jerk off.
-To plot-- What?

1281
01:00:35.291 --> 01:00:39.041
-To plot.
-Exactly. The meeting's already underway.

1282
01:00:39.125 --> 01:00:40.833
Then we haven't a moment to lose.

1283
01:00:40.916 --> 01:00:43.958
George. wait.
We don't have the silver bullet yet.

1284
01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:46.458
-We need it to kill Arnold.
-Damn it! That's right.

1285
01:00:46.541 --> 01:00:48.708
Where the hell are those guys
with our silver bullet?

1286
01:00:50.625 --> 01:00:52.958
[hip-hop music playing]

1287
01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:56.958
...and then the big dumb one says.
"We won Vietnam."

1288
01:00:57.041 --> 01:00:58.625
[laughs]

1289
01:00:58.708 --> 01:01:04.916
Can you imagine being so used to winning
at everything for your whole life.

1290
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.166
that even when you lose.
your brain's just like.

1291
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:10.541
"Yo. we must've won that shit. right?"

1292
01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:13.083
That's the definition of privilege.
right there.

1293
01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:16.666
Oh. I've tried to
tell them that so many times.

1294
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.583
but they don't even hear me.

1295
01:01:18.666 --> 01:01:20.250
You wanna get through to them.

1296
01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:23.166
you'd have to put
your message in like. I don't know.

1297
01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:26.583
the dumbest thing possible.
like a cartoon or something.

1298
01:01:27.833 --> 01:01:30.708
Hey. so how much longer
on this silver bullet?

1299
01:01:30.791 --> 01:01:33.041
-Man. that shit been done for hours.
-What?

1300
01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:34.583
[both laugh]

1301
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:37.375
Oh. yeah.

1302
01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:39.750
I can't wait any longer.

1303
01:01:39.833 --> 01:01:42.000
I have to rescue my wife and unborn child.

1304
01:01:42.083 --> 01:01:44.041
If that baby-eating bastard is in there--

1305
01:01:44.125 --> 01:01:47.041
Oh. my God! He threatened
to eat your unborn baby?

1306
01:01:47.125 --> 01:01:50.666
No. no. no. I mean. not literally.
But. look. he's very evil. Edison.

1307
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:52.958
I mean. come on.
Are we splittin' hairs here?

1308
01:01:53.041 --> 01:01:55.458
George. without that silver bullet.
we'll all be dinner.

1309
01:01:55.541 --> 01:01:59.416
I know. okay? Look. guys.
I don't expect you to go in there.

1310
01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.583
It's suicide. but I have to.

1311
01:02:01.666 --> 01:02:03.625
George. we're a team.

1312
01:02:03.708 --> 01:02:06.125
If there's even a chance
we can save your family.

1313
01:02:06.208 --> 01:02:07.833
we have to take it. Right. guys?

1314
01:02:07.916 --> 01:02:11.333
-Plus. I just heard he eats babies!
-Oh. no!

1315
01:02:11.416 --> 01:02:13.166
-Sam. no!
-I knew it!

1316
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:16.333
There's no time to lose.
Come on. Let's get our sneak on.

1317
01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:31.291
[softly] Science.

1318
01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:36.125
Uh-huh. The door's not locked.

1319
01:02:36.208 --> 01:02:39.250
It didn't need to be. Laser beams.

1320
01:02:39.333 --> 01:02:41.541
Hope you boys are limbered up.

1321
01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:46.833
Easy. Easy. does it. Easy. Daddy.
Oh. easy.

1322
01:02:46.916 --> 01:02:48.750
[grunts]

1323
01:02:48.833 --> 01:02:51.916
Uh. guys. this is just yarn.

1324
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.708
I'm creeping very quietly.

1325
01:02:59.625 --> 01:03:01.125
Don't you move. bad guy!

1326
01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:04.333
[laughs]

1327
01:03:04.416 --> 01:03:07.041
Look at him go! That's great!

1328
01:03:11.958 --> 01:03:14.250
Ha-ha! What the shit?

1329
01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:17.750
Who fucking drew this?
This is completely unrealistic.

1330
01:03:17.833 --> 01:03:20.458
-[man 1 over speaker] Pip-Pip. cheerio.
-[man 2] Bob's your uncle.

1331
01:03:20.541 --> 01:03:22.375
-[man 1] Ello. guv!
-[man 3] Bangers and mash.

1332
01:03:24.958 --> 01:03:26.958
[man 3] Enslave the Irish! [laughs]

1333
01:03:27.666 --> 01:03:29.250
That bastard set us up.

1334
01:03:29.916 --> 01:03:31.250
Martha!

1335
01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:35.083
-Martha!
-George. wait! It's a… trap.

1336
01:03:35.166 --> 01:03:36.458
Yep. shit.

1337
01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:40.166
-What did they do to your wife?
-Paul. that's not Martha.

1338
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:42.125
It's a hyper-thermobaric bomb.

1339
01:03:42.208 --> 01:03:45.625
My hand blasters should interrupt
the current to the triggering mechanism.

1340
01:03:45.708 --> 01:03:46.958
[whispers] Science.

1341
01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:49.000
-[beeping]
-Oh. what?

1342
01:03:49.083 --> 01:03:51.125
Witch. that was your one chance

1343
01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:53.958
and your beloved science
totally fucked us!

1344
01:03:54.041 --> 01:03:56.375
I don't understand. I used science.

1345
01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:59.541
We're outta time. I have to
get this as far away as possible.

1346
01:03:59.625 --> 01:04:01.000
It's up to you guys now.

1347
01:04:01.083 --> 01:04:03.666
Save Martha! Save America!

1348
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:06.041
No. you save her yourself. George.

1349
01:04:06.125 --> 01:04:08.208
This is a job for a racist.

1350
01:04:08.291 --> 01:04:10.958
The fastest racist in the colonies.

1351
01:04:11.583 --> 01:04:12.958
Goodbye. people friends!

1352
01:04:14.791 --> 01:04:15.875
-[neighs]
-Yah!

1353
01:04:15.958 --> 01:04:18.375
Go. Clyde! Fast as the wind!

1354
01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.541
Hey. compadre. vamanos!

1355
01:04:24.625 --> 01:04:26.166
Clyde. what are you talking about?

1356
01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:29.458
Clyde can get a lot further away
without Pablo's added weight.

1357
01:04:29.541 --> 01:04:31.458
No! But Clyde is Paul's only friend!

1358
01:04:31.541 --> 01:04:35.333
-No. Pablo has human friends now.
-But. Clyde--

1359
01:04:35.416 --> 01:04:37.833
Go! Git! [neighs]

1360
01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:39.750
Don't you see?

1361
01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:43.375
-Clyde doesn't want Pablo around anymore.
-What?

1362
01:04:43.458 --> 01:04:46.083
-Git! Damn it. Pablo. git!
-Clyde. no!

1363
01:04:46.166 --> 01:04:49.333
-Get away!
-Clyde. why would you say that? No!

1364
01:04:49.416 --> 01:04:51.291
[crying] Clyde. please!

1365
01:04:51.875 --> 01:04:54.708
Clyde!

1366
01:04:57.583 --> 01:05:00.708
Oh. I guess that big idiot
really cared about us.

1367
01:05:00.791 --> 01:05:02.416
Yeah. he really did.

1368
01:05:04.375 --> 01:05:05.541
[laughing maniacally]

1369
01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:08.250
[George] King James. we meet at last.

1370
01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:11.500
Yes. yes. Kudos. Washington.

1371
01:05:11.583 --> 01:05:16.166
I see that you managed to evade the trap
your old friend Benedict laid for you.

1372
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:17.541
Evade this. butter teeth!

1373
01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:19.333
Sam. you're not gonna…

1374
01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.166
-[laughing]
-[Thomas] It's a hologram.

1375
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.916
Where's my wife. you bastard?

1376
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.166
I believe you mean…
Where is your future queen?

1377
01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:28.250
Never!

1378
01:05:28.333 --> 01:05:29.875
Oh. you'll come round.

1379
01:05:29.958 --> 01:05:30.791
Martha!

1380
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:35.000
If you lay even one
of your sausage fingers on her.

1381
01:05:35.083 --> 01:05:36.750
I'll rip your fucking dick off!

1382
01:05:36.833 --> 01:05:38.750
You better make it quick. George.

1383
01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:42.041
because we're about
to become very well acquainted.

1384
01:05:42.125 --> 01:05:44.416
No more repartee. James.

1385
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.750
No more games!

1386
01:05:45.833 --> 01:05:48.541
I want you face-to-face.

1387
01:05:48.625 --> 01:05:51.250
Hmm. What did you have in mind?

1388
01:05:51.333 --> 01:05:52.458
Tomorrow.

1389
01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:54.708
For all the fucking marbles.

1390
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:56.708
My squad. Your squad!

1391
01:05:56.791 --> 01:06:01.166
You mean. your squad
and my giant fuck-off army!

1392
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:04.166
Bring me every Redcoat alive
for all I care.

1393
01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:06.458
I'll bring extra gas for my chainsaws.

1394
01:06:06.541 --> 01:06:09.583
I accept.
Tomorrow morning. Attrition Field.

1395
01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:11.916
Eight o'clock. sharp. Don't be late.

1396
01:06:12.666 --> 01:06:14.875
[Paul yelling] Clyde!

1397
01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:16.416
[sobbing]

1398
01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:19.541
Hmm. He gonna be okay?

1399
01:06:19.625 --> 01:06:23.083
You sacrificed Clyde… to save us?

1400
01:06:23.166 --> 01:06:25.000
Clyde sacrificed himself.

1401
01:06:25.083 --> 01:06:27.208
I love my new people friends.

1402
01:06:27.291 --> 01:06:29.500
but I loved Clyde. too!

1403
01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:32.791
He was my brother!

1404
01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:36.583
There's gotta be something we can do.

1405
01:06:36.666 --> 01:06:39.125
Well. I'm in a book club
with Clara Barton.

1406
01:06:40.458 --> 01:06:43.333
[scoffs] The groundbreaking
medical practitioner?

1407
01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:46.625
His name's Clara?

1408
01:06:47.208 --> 01:06:48.958
[Clara] I think I can save him.

1409
01:06:49.041 --> 01:06:52.791
But it will require the full breadth
of my cybernetic research to do so.

1410
01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:54.666
-Meaning?
-Meaning when I'm done…

1411
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:57.000
He'll be more machine than animal.

1412
01:06:57.083 --> 01:06:58.333
And there's also a chance

1413
01:06:58.416 --> 01:07:01.958
that at some point in the distant future.
he'll rise up against us and--

1414
01:07:02.041 --> 01:07:04.708
The horse owes me three bucks.
so do what you gotta do. Doc.

1415
01:07:04.791 --> 01:07:08.083
It's a long shot.
My nanotechnology is advanced.

1416
01:07:08.166 --> 01:07:10.916
but there's really just
no substitute for living tissue.

1417
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.750
Go. I need to be alone with Clyde.

1418
01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:15.375
Okay. Paul. Okay.

1419
01:07:15.458 --> 01:07:17.125
[Paul sobs]

1420
01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:23.541
[munching loudly]

1421
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.416
Say what you will about these colonists.

1422
01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.333
but frying a chicken
and putting it in a bucket.

1423
01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:35.041
that's a solid idea.

1424
01:07:36.833 --> 01:07:38.500
Aren't you thirsty. my queen?

1425
01:07:38.583 --> 01:07:41.333
I'll never drink
your over-taxed tea. James.

1426
01:07:41.416 --> 01:07:44.875
You'll feel much more agreeable
after a relaxing soak.

1427
01:07:44.958 --> 01:07:47.708
Arnold. has milady's bath been drawn?

1428
01:07:47.791 --> 01:07:50.625
Yes. my liege. Earl Grey. hot.

1429
01:07:50.708 --> 01:07:52.083
Excellent!

1430
01:07:52.166 --> 01:07:55.916
Oh! [laughing] Look at this.
it's a double-stuffed pizza crust.

1431
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.208
Just… I mean.
do the maths. Arnold. It's impossible.

1432
01:08:03.958 --> 01:08:04.833
[gags]

1433
01:08:04.916 --> 01:08:05.833
Did you want some?

1434
01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:07.666
Enjoy it while you can. James.

1435
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:10.333
Before my husband
rips your fucking dick off!

1436
01:08:10.416 --> 01:08:14.916
My dear. now that my
Ultimate Doomsday Machine is complete.

1437
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.958
your husband and his
band of traitorous ne'er-do-wells

1438
01:08:19.041 --> 01:08:21.500
will soon be ripping their own dicks off.

1439
01:08:21.583 --> 01:08:23.333
[laughs maniacally]

1440
01:08:23.416 --> 01:08:26.666
-[scoffs] Why would they do that?
-Do what?

1441
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:28.416
Rip their own dicks off?

1442
01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:31.375
Because! That's why! [laughs maniacally]

1443
01:08:32.083 --> 01:08:33.958
Is he a cookie or is he a puss?

1444
01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:37.625
You know what? I don't care.
He's my new best friend. that's who he is.

1445
01:08:37.708 --> 01:08:38.708
[hesitates]

1446
01:08:38.791 --> 01:08:43.125
Yes. my king. there is so much
this bountiful new land has to offer.

1447
01:08:43.208 --> 01:08:46.791
Yes. And which corner
of my new kingdom

1448
01:08:46.875 --> 01:08:48.833
will you choose to rule. I wonder?

1449
01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:49.750
[gasps] Oh!

1450
01:08:49.833 --> 01:08:53.666
Why don't you take a Dakota?
Hell. take both.

1451
01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:58.041
Why don't I take the whole thing?
[laughs]

1452
01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:00.416
But why?

1453
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:04.083
Because. you double-stuffed buffoon.
why would I want to eat a slice…

1454
01:09:04.166 --> 01:09:05.375
Oh. my God!

1455
01:09:05.458 --> 01:09:08.666
…when I can eat the whole a-pizza pie?

1456
01:09:11.208 --> 01:09:12.333
[munching loudly]

1457
01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:17.708
Finally. freedom has a birthday. Tomorrow.

1458
01:09:19.083 --> 01:09:20.500
So. go home.

1459
01:09:20.583 --> 01:09:22.208
Go home to your friends.

1460
01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:25.500
to your families. to your loved ones.

1461
01:09:26.416 --> 01:09:28.833
And then. ready your arsenals.

1462
01:09:28.916 --> 01:09:31.250
Bring not the weapons
you would use to topple men.

1463
01:09:31.958 --> 01:09:36.041
but the weapons
that you would use to topple armies.

1464
01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:39.458
The weapons
you would use to topple nations.

1465
01:09:40.041 --> 01:09:43.458
For tomorrow. our revolution dies

1466
01:09:43.541 --> 01:09:46.125
and America is born.

1467
01:09:48.666 --> 01:09:50.250
Guide me. old friend.

1468
01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.166
Show me the way.

1469
01:09:53.833 --> 01:09:57.250
[Abe] George. I wish I had
a million friends like you!

1470
01:09:57.333 --> 01:09:58.791
…a million friends…

1471
01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:01.625
Abe. you forward-thinking son of bitch!

1472
01:10:01.708 --> 01:10:05.083
But we're still
gonna need a lot of firepower.

1473
01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:12.291
[man] Well. hey. welcome to Y'all Mart.
How can I help you?

1474
01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.041
Oh. hey. how's it goin'? I need guns.

1475
01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:15.875
Well. bless your heart.

1476
01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:18.875
And did you have
any particular type in mind?

1477
01:10:18.958 --> 01:10:22.791
Um. whatever the firearm equivalent
of a massive overreaction would be.

1478
01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:24.666
Like. for every bullet fired at me.

1479
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:26.958
I'd want to be able
to fire several hundred in return.

1480
01:10:27.041 --> 01:10:31.166
Oh. I see.
And what do you plan on using them for?

1481
01:10:32.875 --> 01:10:34.208
-Hunting?
-Perfect!

1482
01:10:34.291 --> 01:10:36.208
I can definitely help you with that.

1483
01:10:36.291 --> 01:10:38.250
Now. we do have a waiting period.

1484
01:10:38.958 --> 01:10:42.041
And it's over.
Let's get you heavily armed. big fella.

1485
01:10:42.125 --> 01:10:45.416
Fantastic!
Say. aren't you Mr. Kinko's boy?

1486
01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.583
Yes. sir. Frederick Xavier Kinko.
Nice to meet ya.

1487
01:10:49.666 --> 01:10:52.333
Well. Fred X. Kinko. that's convenient.

1488
01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:54.166
I'm also looking for a photocopier.

1489
01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.041
The best in the colonies.

1490
01:11:04.458 --> 01:11:05.541
Were you able to sleep?

1491
01:11:05.625 --> 01:11:06.791
-Yeah.
-Slept like a log.

1492
01:11:06.875 --> 01:11:10.500
Neither was I. No matter.
we'll all sleep soon enough…

1493
01:11:10.583 --> 01:11:12.916
in the beds of vanquished kings.

1494
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.375
Wow. that was beautiful phrasing.
You're gettin' pretty good at this.

1495
01:11:16.458 --> 01:11:18.375
You like that? Really? Check this out.

1496
01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:21.166
Teamwork. it makes the dream work.

1497
01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:23.625
Whoa! He's right. It does.

1498
01:11:23.708 --> 01:11:26.375
Okay. that. right there.
that's leadership.

1499
01:11:26.458 --> 01:11:30.416
Thanks. guys. Look. man.
I gotta say. I'm feeling pretty confident.

1500
01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.916
Maybe things
are going to work out after all.

1501
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.875
-Holy shit.
-Fuck me.

1502
01:11:52.583 --> 01:11:55.000
[trumpets]

1503
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.125
[clock chimes]

1504
01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:08.250
[mechanisms whirring]

1505
01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:11.375
[growls]

1506
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.958
All right. I'm not gonna sugarcoat this.

1507
01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:20.833
Three against ten thousand?
That's pretty bad odds.

1508
01:12:21.416 --> 01:12:23.791
-For us.
-Well. we have the high ground.

1509
01:12:23.875 --> 01:12:25.916
You have more than the high ground.

1510
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.625
Geronimo! Blacksmith!
We thought you deserted.

1511
01:12:28.708 --> 01:12:33.000
Thought about it. like. really hard.
then started going in the other direction.

1512
01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:35.958
Even booked an Air T&P
on the opposite side of town.

1513
01:12:36.041 --> 01:12:38.375
But despite my better judgment.

1514
01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:40.791
I ate the deposit and decided to come.

1515

01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:43.333
Well. I'm not sure. Sammy.
but I have a hypothesis.

1682
01:23:43.916 --> 01:23:48.083
So. let's go test that hypothesis
and draw some fucking conclusions!

1683
01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:53.583
This is for science!

1684
01:23:53.666 --> 01:23:55.208
[echoing]

1685
01:24:04.208 --> 01:24:05.875
[screams]

1686
01:24:11.083 --> 01:24:12.666
[screaming]

1687
01:24:15.708 --> 01:24:16.791
[grunts]

1688
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.500
No! No! Not like this!
Not like this. Martha!

1689
01:24:24.583 --> 01:24:28.375
-Drink it. George! Drink it in.
-No! I won't do it! Ah!

1690
01:24:28.458 --> 01:24:34.250
Fine. resist. And I'll gain full custody
of our son the moment he is born.

1691
01:24:34.333 --> 01:24:36.750
And you'll be helpless to stop it.

1692
01:24:36.833 --> 01:24:42.375
You'll have failed as a leader.
as a husband and as a father.

1693
01:24:42.458 --> 01:24:46.833
just like your father before you.

1694
01:24:46.916 --> 01:24:48.833
[laughs maniacally]

1695
01:24:48.916 --> 01:24:51.208
Hey. hey. it's okay.

1696
01:24:51.291 --> 01:24:53.541
Even though you totally blew it

1697
01:24:53.625 --> 01:24:58.291
and let everyone on the team down.
you tried your best. witch.

1698
01:24:58.375 --> 01:25:01.750
I'm not a witch. Sam. I am a scientist.

1699
01:25:01.833 --> 01:25:03.625
And no. I did not.

1700
01:25:03.708 --> 01:25:07.791
The beam. It wasn't meant to blow
the Teabagger out of the sky.

1701
01:25:07.875 --> 01:25:09.333
-Nope.
-Horse sound.

1702
01:25:09.416 --> 01:25:11.250
What did you do. human lady friend?

1703
01:25:11.333 --> 01:25:13.791
I reversed the polarity of the tea.

1704
01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:24.833
So. if it ain't tea no more.
what the fuck is it?

1705
01:25:24.916 --> 01:25:26.750
The exact opposite of tea.

1706
01:25:28.458 --> 01:25:31.916
[gasps] It's beer! Beer won the war!

1707
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.500
What? No. beer didn't win… No. science!

1708
01:25:34.583 --> 01:25:36.375
[all] Bro!

1709
01:25:38.125 --> 01:25:42.166
I'd just like to say something.
you know. as the leader of the group.

1710
01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:45.500
Thirty minutes ago.
I dreamed of a bigger fraternity.

1711
01:25:45.583 --> 01:25:49.375
And now. I look around and I have it.

1712
01:25:50.166 --> 01:25:52.625
That's the power
of positive thinking. guys.

1713
01:25:52.708 --> 01:25:55.583
-Believe in yourselves!
-Are you kidding me?

1714
01:25:55.666 --> 01:25:57.916
Mmm. delicious. isn't it?

1715
01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.708
[coughs]

1716
01:26:10.416 --> 01:26:11.416
[eagle screeches]

1717
01:26:17.791 --> 01:26:19.041
Ah!

1718
01:26:21.708 --> 01:26:24.500
Oh! George? What happened?

1719
01:26:24.583 --> 01:26:27.333
Science. Martha. Science happened.

1720
01:26:27.416 --> 01:26:29.708
Oh. my God! I could have… I almost…

1721
01:26:29.791 --> 01:26:32.666
[shushes] No. don't you worry about that.

1722
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:36.833
You're back now
and we've just got one thing left to do.

1723
01:26:36.916 --> 01:26:38.750
-Have awesome sex!
-Final boss battle. What?

1724
01:26:38.833 --> 01:26:41.250
Uh. yep. Yep. Final boss battle.

1725
01:26:41.333 --> 01:26:42.750
-Bro!
-No!

1726
01:26:42.833 --> 01:26:45.666
Bros. Bros everywhere!

1727
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:48.750
It reeks of Ye Olde Axe body spray!

1728
01:26:48.833 --> 01:26:50.083
[George] Excuse me. sir.

1729
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:56.083
Do you have a moment
to talk about freedom?

1730
01:26:56.166 --> 01:27:00.750
Aren't you surprised to see me
leading the British and not King James?

1731
01:27:00.833 --> 01:27:03.583
What? No. You obviously
pulled a Benedict Arnold.

1732
01:27:03.666 --> 01:27:04.666
A what?

1733
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:07.041
A Benedict Arnold.
You're a thing now. bro.

1734
01:27:07.125 --> 01:27:09.666
Whenever you get fucked over
by a trusted friend.

1735
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:12.333
it's called getting Benedict Arnolded.
Right. everybody?

1736
01:27:12.416 --> 01:27:14.458
-[all] Yeah.
-It's totally a thing.

1737
01:27:14.541 --> 01:27:16.791
No. You… You can't just do that.

1738
01:27:16.875 --> 01:27:19.875
Oh. yeah. we can.
Because we all voted on it.

1739
01:27:19.958 --> 01:27:21.333
And that's called…

1740
01:27:21.416 --> 01:27:23.125
[all] Fucking Democracy!

1741
01:27:23.208 --> 01:27:24.416
We're doin' it!

1742
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.833
[laughing] Oh. Georgie.

1743
01:27:26.916 --> 01:27:29.000
You think you've won.

1744
01:27:30.416 --> 01:27:31.833
[growls]

1745
01:27:32.416 --> 01:27:35.041
Mega Wolf!

1746
01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:36.000
Geronimo. now!

1747
01:27:37.458 --> 01:27:38.500
Launch winch-chain.

1748
01:27:39.208 --> 01:27:41.125
-[grunts]
-[neighs]

1749
01:27:41.208 --> 01:27:42.541
[growls]

1750
01:27:43.208 --> 01:27:44.583
Sammy. take the shot!

1751
01:27:45.541 --> 01:27:47.500
Here comes the boom. bitch.

1752
01:27:48.791 --> 01:27:50.333
[grunting]

1753
01:27:52.791 --> 01:27:55.416
[growling]

1754
01:27:58.416 --> 01:27:59.541
[grunts]

1755
01:28:03.166 --> 01:28:05.333
Guys. I don't know
how much more he can take!

1756
01:28:05.416 --> 01:28:07.458
-Where's the stupid bullet?
-We're looking!

1757
01:28:07.541 --> 01:28:10.458
Any last regrets. old chum?

1758
01:28:10.541 --> 01:28:15.208
Yeah. I only regret that I have
but one life to give for my country.

1759
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:20.208
Yes. Well. I suppose
the one will have to do.

1760
01:28:20.291 --> 01:28:23.416
Oh. shit! It's right here.
Guys! I found it!

1761
01:28:24.541 --> 01:28:27.625
What are you smiling about. you idiot?
You can't possibly kill me.

1762
01:28:27.708 --> 01:28:29.791
I'm not trying to kill you. Ben.

1763
01:28:29.875 --> 01:28:34.083
They are. With America's favorite pastime.

1764
01:28:34.166 --> 01:28:35.083
No!

1765
01:28:39.791 --> 01:28:41.166
Tax this. motherfucker!

1766
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.583
[commentator]
It's going way back to right field.

1767
01:28:48.666 --> 01:28:50.916
The bullet is still going!
High up in there!

1768
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.041
-Bugger!
-He did it!

1769
01:28:53.833 --> 01:28:56.166
John Henry Smith did it!

1770
01:28:56.250 --> 01:28:57.458
[all cheer]

1771
01:29:01.583 --> 01:29:05.875
Welcome to America!

1772
01:29:11.041 --> 01:29:12.875
[cheering]

1773
01:29:16.833 --> 01:29:18.625
[whooping]

1774
01:29:36.208 --> 01:29:38.125
[George] I wanna make a monument
for Abe. too.

1775
01:29:38.208 --> 01:29:40.583
But of course. Mr. President.
Same as yours?

1776
01:29:40.666 --> 01:29:41.750
No. I.M. Pei.

1777
01:29:41.833 --> 01:29:47.500
His should be a statue of him
sitting there. staring at my monument.

1778
01:29:47.583 --> 01:29:49.500
[Abe chuckling] Who are you. Demi Moore?

1779
01:29:49.583 --> 01:29:51.625
Why you gotta screw
a ghost like that. George?

1780
01:29:51.708 --> 01:29:54.916
Abe! Ah. bro!
God. it's good to see you again. man.

1781
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.958
Well. you're gonna feel like a real turd
after you see what I brought you. Hah!

1782
01:29:59.041 --> 01:30:00.916
The Declaration! You saved it!

1783
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:01.916
I did.

1784
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.041
A little of Mr. Scotch's invisible tape
and it's as good as new.

1785
01:30:05.125 --> 01:30:06.166
It's beautiful. Abe.

1786
01:30:06.250 --> 01:30:09.916
It is. but you're the real
national treasure here. George.

1787
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.458
I'm proud of you. bud.

1788
01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:16.708
And no. there's no treasure map
drawn on the back of it.

1789
01:30:16.791 --> 01:30:18.833
-Oh. man.
-George. what are you doin'. bro?

1790
01:30:18.916 --> 01:30:20.708
-They're lookin' for you out there.
-Oh. Sam!

1791
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:23.125
I'm glad you're here.
I have something for you.

1792
01:30:23.208 --> 01:30:26.375
-What is it?
-A gift for my son's godfather.

1793
01:30:26.458 --> 01:30:27.708
-Who. me?
-Yep.

1794
01:30:27.791 --> 01:30:31.083
I need someone
I can trust with my son's life.

1795
01:30:31.166 --> 01:30:33.250
And I always thought it would be Abe.

1796
01:30:33.333 --> 01:30:37.041
But with him as a gho… a goner.
I need to find someone else.

1797
01:30:37.125 --> 01:30:39.166
George. I'm honored!

1798
01:30:39.250 --> 01:30:40.666
Hey. is that my hat? Oh. it is.

1799
01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:43.916
But… Ugh. I don't know
how to be a caretaker.

1800
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.458
I don't have those instincts.

1801
01:30:45.541 --> 01:30:47.916
No. don't think of it
as being the caretaker.

1802
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.333
Think of it as being family.

1803
01:30:49.416 --> 01:30:50.750
Like the fun. drunk.

1804
01:30:50.833 --> 01:30:55.833
now definitely no-longer-racist uncle
that America has always needed.

1805
01:30:55.916 --> 01:30:58.875
Uncle Sam. I like It.

1806
01:30:58.958 --> 01:31:00.875
Uncle fucking Sam!

1807
01:31:00.958 --> 01:31:04.250
Come on. Uncle Sam. our countrymen await.

1808
01:31:05.916 --> 01:31:08.666
[crowd cheering and applauding]

1809
01:31:14.625 --> 01:31:15.708
Hey. Denzel.

1810
01:31:15.791 --> 01:31:16.708
[giggles]

1811
01:31:18.083 --> 01:31:19.583
[crowd cheers]

1812
01:31:26.458 --> 01:31:28.000
My fellow Americans.

1813
01:31:28.083 --> 01:31:32.750
on this day. July 4th. 1776.

1814
01:31:32.833 --> 01:31:36.916
we are all finally free!

1815
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.958
[all cheer]

1816
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.666
[man 1] What about your slaves?

1817
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:52.416
Oh! Um…

1818
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:56.916
-I said. what about your slaves?
-[George] Well. see--

1819
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.375
And what about women?

1820
01:31:58.458 --> 01:32:01.291
Will we be granted equality
in your America?

1821
01:32:01.375 --> 01:32:04.250
-Yes. but--
-Sure. right after the Indians.

1822
01:32:04.333 --> 01:32:07.750
Wait a second. I was under the impression
we were getting our land back.

1823
01:32:07.833 --> 01:32:08.833
Good point. Um…

1824
01:32:08.916 --> 01:32:10.791
Oh. hey. can I keep this here machine gun?

1825
01:32:10.875 --> 01:32:13.541
Like. if a Mexican
tries to take my property or something?

1826
01:32:13.625 --> 01:32:15.833
What? You just took this land
from the Indians--

1827
01:32:15.916 --> 01:32:17.583
He was coming for you. I saw it!

1828
01:32:17.666 --> 01:32:20.958
-He just shot him! In the back!
-He was making a move. man. I swear it!

1829
01:32:21.041 --> 01:32:24.583
We're gonna have a fair
and unbiased judicial process. right?

1830
01:32:24.666 --> 01:32:27.041
-Everyone. just calm down!
-Fuck you!

1831
01:32:27.125 --> 01:32:28.541
No. fuck you!

1832
01:32:28.625 --> 01:32:30.791
Hey. I just wanna marry my boyfriend.

1833
01:32:31.458 --> 01:32:32.500
Sinner!

1834
01:32:32.583 --> 01:32:34.875
There's gonna be
comprehensive health care. right?

1835
01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:38.958
[man 1] Seriously. dude.
What about your slaves?

1836
01:32:39.041 --> 01:32:42.541
Oh. God.
We're gonna fuck this up. aren't we?

1837
01:33:35.541 --> 01:33:38.291
Dagnabbit! I think we missed it. E's.

1838
01:33:38.375 --> 01:33:40.083
[growls weakly]
