I just thought--

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:17.667
Editors make
the creative decisions.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.266

written permission.

some heavyweights.

Lisa Benton broke her leg?

to do that waterfall piece.

I'm hungry.

"Miles." plural.

Well. find me somebody.

Oh. yeah. Thanks.

98
00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:04.233
I was wondering

99
00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:05.433
if you might consider me
for the waterfall piece.

100
00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:07.800
Consider you how?

101
00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:10.333

I'm just a software geek.

00:04:25.633 --> 00:04:28.767
I need someone
who knows what they're doing.

[sighing] Ah.

112
00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:32.900
You were saying?

Oh.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.233
These are yours?

I know I can do this.

116
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.967
You know. capturing
someone's personality

117
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.266
is a very different skill set

118
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.834
than capturing natural objects
like waterfalls.

119
00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:51.767
Well. waterfalls
have personalities too.

120
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.633
It just needs
someone who can see it.

121
00:04:57.633 --> 00:05:01.900
Okay. you know what?

122
00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:03.433
Someone was once crazy enough
to give me my first shot

123
00:05:03.567 --> 00:05:05.433
and I never looked back.

124
00:05:05.567 --> 00:05:06.633
So.

then you can stay on.

And of course.
our famous waterfalls.

Well. the waterfalls
are actually why I'm here.

Yes! Little Miss Suzie.

188
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.166
That's an easy one.

189
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.667
Simple. marked. easy to hike.

190
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.633
Uh...

191
00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:52.066
you're gonna go north
from the lodge.

192
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.834
So. north would be this way.

193
00:07:53.967 --> 00:07:55.200
and you want to take
trail number three.

194
00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:56.700
Follow the signs.

195
00:07:56.834 --> 00:07:58.100
and it'll be impossible
for you to get lost.

196
00:07:58.233 --> 00:07:59.734
Oh. by the way.
my name is Leo.

197
00:07:59.867 --> 00:08:00.900
so if you need anything.
I'm here to help.

198
00:08:01.033 --> 00:08:02.767
Thanks. Leo.

199
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.767
You're the best!

200
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.900
[laughs] See you soon.

201
00:08:08.033 --> 00:08:09.567
Take care.

202
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.734
[♪♪]

203
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.667
Huh. Not bad.

204
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.900
They've even got
a fireplace and everything.

205
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.767
"Look the part. be the part."

206
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.900
That's what they say.

[birds chirping]

208
00:09:04.867 --> 00:09:08.900
Excuse me?

209
00:09:09.033 --> 00:09:10.033
Yeah?
Do you know

210
00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:11.300
how to get to Suzie Falls?

211
00:09:11.433 --> 00:09:12.767
Back that way.
about a half a mile.

212
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.734
-Can't miss it.
-Of course.

213
00:09:14.867 --> 00:09:16.033
Thanks.

216
00:09:25.867 --> 00:09:28.967
Yes!

217
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.333
[girl] It's been one of
my favorites for a long time.

218
00:09:30.467 --> 00:09:33.767
[man] Yeah. me too.

[shutter snapping]

220
00:09:39.934 --> 00:09:44.133
I'll be right back.

221
00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:45.333
Okay.

222
00:09:45.467 --> 00:09:47.600
[snapping]

223
00:09:47.734 --> 00:09:52.066
Never been one
to trust a sale.

224
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.100
When something's on sale.

225
00:09:55.233 --> 00:09:56.834
I can't help but wonder

226
00:09:56.967 --> 00:09:57.900
if it's because
it's out of season.

227
00:09:58.033 --> 00:09:59.600
or they had too much inventory.

228
00:09:59.734 --> 00:10:01.700
or maybe it's because
it's poorly made.

229
00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:03.000
and they wanted
to get rid of it.

230
00:10:03.133 --> 00:10:04.333
Interesting things to ponder.

231
00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:06.567
Which I'm sure I will...

232
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.500
the next time I'm shopping.

233
00:10:12.934 --> 00:10:17.166
Hey! What are you do--

234
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.066
[♪♪]

235
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.934
For the record.

236
00:10:24.066 --> 00:10:25.133
that was
an "end of the season" sale.

237
00:10:25.266 --> 00:10:28.000
What are you doing. Dad?

238
00:10:28.133 --> 00:10:30.300
I'm helping this poor hiker

239
00:10:30.433 --> 00:10:32.100
out of
a potentially perilous situation

240
00:10:32.233 --> 00:10:33.934
involving sale tags.

241
00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:36.100
How embarrassing.

242
00:10:36.233 --> 00:10:37.800
Not as embarrassing

243
00:10:37.934 --> 00:10:39.233
if he starts saying
some of his bad "dad jokes."

244
00:10:39.367 --> 00:10:41.900
which he never seems
to understand aren't funny.

245
00:10:42.033 --> 00:10:44.934
He actually started
with the "bad dad jokes"

246
00:10:45.066 --> 00:10:47.867
before the reveal.

247
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.700
I knew it.

248
00:10:49.834 --> 00:10:50.734
In my defense.

249
00:10:51.066 --> 00:10:52.133
I'm actually considered quite
funny in some circles.

250
00:10:52.266 --> 00:10:54.300
Okay?

251
00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:56.900
Looks like
this is your first time here?

252
00:10:57.033 --> 00:10:59.900
Caught me on that one.

253
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.867
I'm Mark North.

254
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.133
This is Kyra.

255
00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:04.266
my sidekick
and also my daughter.

256
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.767
Hi.

257
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.166
Amy Atwater.
Nice to meet you.

258
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.834
So what do you think?

259
00:11:11.967 --> 00:11:14.166
It's awesome.

260
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.066
I read up on it a little bit
before I got here.

261
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.233
but. uh. the photos
don't do it justice.

262
00:11:18.367 --> 00:11:21.867
Not yet. anyway.

263
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.400
Suzie Falls...

264
00:11:23.533 --> 00:11:24.834
one of our most popular spots.

265
00:11:24.967 --> 00:11:27.233
She is a bit temperamental.

266
00:11:27.367 --> 00:11:29.033
Temperamental?

267
00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:30.166
Oh. yeah.

268
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.367
Waterfalls have
distinct personalities

269
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.667
once you get to know them.

270
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.800
Just like people.

271
00:11:34.934 --> 00:11:36.333
Huh. I'm guessing
you're a park ranger?

272
00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:39.967
Tour guide.
At the lodge.

273
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.266
Oh. that's where I'm staying.

274
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.700
Oh. cool.

275
00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:44.867
I need to get back
to send an email.

276
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.100
Can you tell me
the fastest way?

277
00:11:47.233 --> 00:11:49.166
I somehow took the long cut
to get here.

278
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.133
Yeah. sure.

279
00:11:52.266 --> 00:11:53.300
So. you just follow
the main trail there.

280
00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:56.066
Keep going until
you get to number three.

281
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.700
Go left.

282
00:11:58.834 --> 00:11:59.734
and stay left.

283
00:11:59.867 --> 00:12:00.934
follow the signs
back to the lodge.

284
00:12:01.066 --> 00:12:02.967
It's a bit up-and-down.
but it's pretty easy.

285
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.233
I think I can handle that.

286
00:12:05.367 --> 00:12:08.233
Well... thank you.

287
00:12:08.367 --> 00:12:10.467
No problem.

288
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.433
So. uh.
maybe I'll see you around?

289
00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:15.967
Well. if you're staying
at the lodge.

290
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.400
then for sure.

291
00:12:17.533 --> 00:12:18.300
Bye.

292
00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:19.900
Bye!

293
00:12:20.033 --> 00:12:23.767
Well. she's really nice.

294
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.066
Yeah. she is.

295
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.967
And pretty.

296
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.100
Is she?

297
00:12:28.233 --> 00:12:30.133
Didn't notice.

298
00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:31.233
[Kyra snickers]

299
00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:32.567
[♪♪]

300
00:12:36.834 --> 00:12:41.000
Yes that way.

301
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.533
Yeah.

302
00:12:50.967 --> 00:12:55.767
Wow! I make
some really good sandwiches.

303
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.533
You really do.

304
00:13:00.467 --> 00:13:04.400
Hey!

305
00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:05.834
Hey.

306
00:13:05.967 --> 00:13:09.433
"Long cut"?

307
00:13:09.567 --> 00:13:10.533
What? No. No. no. no.
I. uh...

308
00:13:13.533 --> 00:13:15.066
with different lighting.
you know.

309
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.000
and I wanna make sure
I didn't miss anything.

310
00:13:17.133 --> 00:13:18.400
but I'm all done now.

311
00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:20.233
Oh. so you walked a mile
out of your way

312
00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:21.800
to get that perfect shot?

313
00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:23.500
Yeah! Yeah. I was. uh...

314
00:13:23.633 --> 00:13:26.266
exploring
and stuff like that.

315
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.834
Would you like us to show you
the way back to the lodge?

316
00:13:30.967 --> 00:13:33.100
Well... if you guys
are on your way there.

317
00:13:33.233 --> 00:13:36.800
might as well walk together.

318
00:13:36.934 --> 00:13:38.400
Sure.

319
00:13:38.533 --> 00:13:39.633
Uh. I do have

320
00:13:39.767 --> 00:13:41.033
I do have a flat rate of $500
for guided tours though.

321
00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:43.867
-Oh!
-Yeah.

322
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.300
Um. uh...

323
00:13:45.433 --> 00:13:46.300
well--

324
00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:47.266
It's one of his bad dad jokes.

325
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.000
[laughs]

326
00:13:49.133 --> 00:13:51.033
She's laughing.

327
00:13:51.166 --> 00:13:52.133
It was kinda funny.

328
00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:54.133
Okay. come on.

329
00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:55.100
I'll show you the way.

330
00:13:55.233 --> 00:13:56.500
Oh. great.

331
00:13:56.633 --> 00:13:58.033
[Mark] All right. everyone.
pack up your sandwiches.

332
00:13:58.166 --> 00:13:59.467
We got a new person
joining the group.

333
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.934
[Amy] I-- I mean. I already
know how to get there.

334
00:14:03.066 --> 00:14:05.333
[Kyra and Mark. overlapping]"
Yeah. of course.

335
00:14:05.467 --> 00:14:06.367
[Mark] So. uh. up we go.

336
00:14:08.233 --> 00:14:09.967
That's the thing.

337
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.900
[Mark] Oh. absolutely.

338
00:14:12.033 --> 00:14:16.433
I know
this is none of my business.

339
00:14:16.567 --> 00:14:18.467
but if you're serious
about hiking this area.

340
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.133
you're gonna need
better shoes than those.

341
00:14:20.266 --> 00:14:22.300
These are really comfortable!

342
00:14:22.433 --> 00:14:23.467
And dangerous.

343
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.934
A lot of these trails
to the other waterfalls

344
00:14:25.066 --> 00:14:26.467
are pretty steep.

345
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.266
Well. I'll keep that in mind.

346
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.533
especially if I'm going to find
my way to Redwood Falls.

347
00:14:30.667 --> 00:14:33.400
Redwood Falls?

348
00:14:33.533 --> 00:14:34.900
Have you heard of it?

349
00:14:35.033 --> 00:14:36.033
Of course. I've heard of it.

350
00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:37.467
One of the great myths
of our time.

351
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.567
Doesn't exist. though.

352
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.200
I'm told that's what

353
00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:42.600
the locals tell people
so they don't go looking for it.

354
00:14:42.734 --> 00:14:45.266
-Mm.
-Have you seen it?

355
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.000
No one has.

356
00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:49.500
Is that the SP-1?

357
00:14:49.633 --> 00:14:50.967
It is.

358
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.166
Wow. You know your cameras.

359
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.233
I love photography.

360
00:14:54.367 --> 00:14:56.100
I saw that one on
an Instagram account I follow.

361
00:14:56.233 --> 00:14:58.333
It looks awesome.

362
00:14:58.467 --> 00:15:00.400
My dad says
it's too expensive.

363
00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:01.333
Because it is.

364
00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:04.467
Do want to try it?

365
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.166
-Really?
-Yeah.

366
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.900
Okay.

367
00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:09.667
Neck strap--
always keep it around your neck.

368
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.166
That's kind of a rule of thumb

369
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.667
when you shoot
outside the studio.

370
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.433
'Kay. you got
the shutter button right there.

371
00:15:16.567 --> 00:15:18.400
and if you want
to zoom in or out.

372
00:15:18.533 --> 00:15:20.066
just gently...

373
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.333
twist the lens.

374
00:15:21.467 --> 00:15:23.400
'Kay.

375
00:15:23.533 --> 00:15:25.433
[shutter snapping]

376
00:15:25.567 --> 00:15:29.533
Oh. wow.

377
00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:30.433
Oh!

378
00:15:30.567 --> 00:15:31.400
A hummingbird!

379
00:15:31.533 --> 00:15:33.300
Wow.

380
00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.166
Oh. that's a really good shot.

381
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.000
Really?

382
00:15:38.133 --> 00:15:39.000
She is good.

383
00:15:39.133 --> 00:15:41.000
Seriously... Kyra.

384
00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:43.333
The way you framed that.

385
00:15:43.467 --> 00:15:45.133
those are
some great instincts.

386
00:15:45.266 --> 00:15:46.266
Thanks.

387
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.533
I wish I had
a better camera. though.

388
00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:50.100
Your phone will do for now.

389
00:15:50.233 --> 00:15:52.000
He's right.

390
00:15:52.133 --> 00:15:53.066
It's the singer.
not the song.

391
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.233
It's an old saying.
The point is--

392
00:15:55.367 --> 00:15:57.633
if you have an eye
for capturing a moment.

393
00:15:57.767 --> 00:15:59.300
it doesn't matter if you have
$1 camera or a $1.000 camera.

394
00:15:59.433 --> 00:16:03.467
Then why do you have
a $1.000 camera?

395
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.000
It's a little bit more
than that.

396
00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:08.200
But it's got
some really cool stuff.

397
00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:09.600
like dynamic range

398
00:16:09.734 --> 00:16:11.200
and geotagging.
which helps you remember

399
00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:12.967
where you were
when you took the picture.

400
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.333
See?

401
00:16:14.467 --> 00:16:15.467
Keep walking.

402
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.667
[Kyra sighs dramatically]

403
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.066
[Amy chuckles]

404
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.467
You can get
some proper shoes in there.

405
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.100
I got a tour group
leaving in a few minutes.

406
00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:25.367
or I'd help you out.

407
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.500
I think I can manage.

408
00:16:26.633 --> 00:16:27.567
Sure you can find your way?

409
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.433
Might be a challenge.
but I hope so.

410
00:16:29.567 --> 00:16:32.000
However. I might need
some suggestions

411
00:16:32.133 --> 00:16:33.333
on how to find a few
of the other waterfalls?

412
00:16:33.467 --> 00:16:35.967
What's this for anyway?

413
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.000
You're on
some kind of assignment?

414
00:16:37.133 --> 00:16:38.400
Yeah.
Explorer Global Magazine.

415
00:16:38.533 --> 00:16:41.133
We're doing a piece
on waterfalls.

416
00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:43.433
Well. you've come
to the right place.

417
00:16:43.567 --> 00:16:45.166
Well. thanks
for walking me out.

418
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.133
Next time.
stick with a tour group.

419
00:16:48.266 --> 00:16:50.100
I will.

420
00:16:50.233 --> 00:16:51.200
Thanks for letting me
use your camera.

421
00:16:51.333 --> 00:16:53.066
-You're welcome.
-Good luck.

422
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.033
[Mark] That's a really good
photo you took.

423
00:16:57.166 --> 00:17:02.333
[♪♪]

424
00:17:24.867 --> 00:17:29.600
So I was singing
since I was. like. five.

425
00:17:29.734 --> 00:17:31.533
so make sure you come
to the open mic this week.

426
00:17:31.667 --> 00:17:33.567
It's gonna be lovely.

427
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.800
I could put your name
on the list. if you want.

428
00:17:34.934 --> 00:17:35.834
Room 112. Okay?

429
00:17:35.967 --> 00:17:38.934
Good Morning. Leo.

430
00:17:39.066 --> 00:17:40.667
Morning. Amy.

431
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.734
Hey. Leo. quick question.

432
00:17:41.867 --> 00:17:43.900
Yeah.

433
00:17:44.033 --> 00:17:44.867
If I was looking
for waterfalls

434
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.867
that have never been found.
or rare.

435
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.567
who would be my go-to person?

436
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.734
Rare. never-seen waterfalls?

437
00:17:52.867 --> 00:17:54.700
Yeah.

438
00:17:54.834 --> 00:17:57.700
You didn't hear it from me...

439
00:17:57.834 --> 00:17:59.400
but that would be
Mark North.

440
00:17:59.533 --> 00:18:01.533
Mark North?

441
00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:03.333
Yeah. but "never to be found"

442
00:18:03.467 --> 00:18:04.467
is the way that Mark
likes to keep it.

443
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.500
if you know what I'm saying.

444
00:18:06.633 --> 00:18:07.834
I think?

445
00:18:07.967 --> 00:18:08.967
Let's just say.

446
00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.600
don't say your after never
to be found waterfalls.

447
00:18:11.734 --> 00:18:13.367
Got it.

448
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.734
You pickin' up
what I'm puttin' down?

449
00:18:14.867 --> 00:18:15.934
-Oh. yeah.
-All right.

450
00:18:16.066 --> 00:18:17.500
-Thank you. Leo!
-No problem.

451
00:18:17.633 --> 00:18:21.800
[♪♪]

452
00:18:25.033 --> 00:18:28.967
Hmm.

453
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.734
Even more obvious?

454
00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:32.433
It screams

455
00:18:32.567 --> 00:18:33.734
"help."

456
00:18:33.867 --> 00:18:35.433
Maybe that's a good thing.

457
00:18:35.567 --> 00:18:36.967
Let me turn in this paperwork.

458
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.400
then I'll give you
some of my recommendations.

459
00:18:38.533 --> 00:18:40.066
I would love that.
Thanks.

460
00:18:44.033 --> 00:18:48.433
Hey! There you are.

461
00:18:48.567 --> 00:18:49.667
I never heard back from you.

462
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.533
Sorry. It feels like
it's been dawn-till-dusk lately.

463
00:18:52.667 --> 00:18:54.967
Oh. tell me about it.

464
00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.300
I'm booked up
through next week.

465
00:18:56.433 --> 00:18:57.767
Did you cut your hair?

466
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.233
My hair?

467
00:18:59.367 --> 00:19:00.333
Looks different.
It's nice.

468
00:19:00.467 --> 00:19:01.867
Nope. not recently.

469
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.367
Your beard?
Something different there?

470
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.667
Mm...

471
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.533
feels the same.

472
00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:07.767
LIttle. little more colour?

473
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.533
I mean. I do work outside.
so it's possible.

474
00:19:09.667 --> 00:19:11.066
Right.

475
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.667
Hey. I'm just
helping someone out.

476
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.333
so I'll catch up with you
later. okay?

477
00:19:14.467 --> 00:19:16.600
All right.
I can't wait.

478
00:19:16.734 --> 00:19:17.867
I'll just check my schedule.

479
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.867
All right.

480
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.433
Let's see whatcha got there.

481
00:19:22.567 --> 00:19:26.867
So. these boots look nice.

482
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.734
They're expensive
and worthless.

483
00:19:29.867 --> 00:19:31.900
[astonished chuckle]

484
00:19:32.033 --> 00:19:32.900
Then why are
they so expensive?

485
00:19:33.233 --> 00:19:34.433
Cause a lot of people just
care about how they look.

486
00:19:34.567 --> 00:19:36.533
What size are you?

487
00:19:36.667 --> 00:19:37.800
Uh. eight and a half.

488
00:19:37.934 --> 00:19:39.800
Bobby.

489
00:19:39.934 --> 00:19:41.033
can I get an eight-and-a-half
in the Farrell?

490
00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:42.433
Mark. yeah. absolutely.

491
00:19:42.567 --> 00:19:44.066
So. uh...

492
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.800
...how do the hiking tours
work. exactly?

493
00:19:46.934 --> 00:19:49.967
Pretty complicated.

494
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.333
You sign up over there.

495
00:19:51.467 --> 00:19:52.934
This is
the most important part--

496
00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:55.367
you pick a tour you want...

497
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.367
then you follow the tour
on the tour

498
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.900
on the selected day and time
of the tour.

499
00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:01.700
Ha. ha.

500
00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:02.967
I mean...

501
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.367
is there one specific
for the waterfalls?

502
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.533
Several.

503
00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:10.000
Redwood Falls?

504
00:20:10.133 --> 00:20:12.400
Right after the unicorn tour.

505
00:20:12.533 --> 00:20:14.066
Sounds fun.

506
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.934
So. uh. how much
for private tours?

507
00:20:16.066 --> 00:20:19.066
We actually don't do
private tours.

508
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.633
And unfortunately.
there's a wait list

509
00:20:21.767 --> 00:20:22.567
for most of our group tours.

510
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.233
well my company will pay
you handsomely.

511
00:20:25.367 --> 00:20:27.500
maybe even your flat rate
to help lost people

512
00:20:27.633 --> 00:20:30.467
find their way
back to the lodge.

513
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.000
[chuckles]
I'm booked every day.

514
00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:33.900
You don't have one day off?

515
00:20:34.033 --> 00:20:35.367
Well. tomorrow is my day off.

516
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.667
Except that
when it is my day off.

517
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.367
I always spend it
with my daughter.

518
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.934
No exceptions.

519
00:20:41.066 --> 00:20:42.300
That's a pretty great answer.

520
00:20:42.433 --> 00:20:44.867
But begs the question...

521
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.333
what do you two do together

522
00:20:48.467 --> 00:20:50.300
on these days off?

523
00:20:50.433 --> 00:20:51.834
Believe it or not.

524
00:20:51.967 --> 00:20:53.000
sometimes...

525
00:20:53.133 --> 00:20:54.734
we go hiking.

526
00:20:54.867 --> 00:20:56.600
Ah. I had a hunch.

527
00:20:56.734 --> 00:20:59.900
Um. I will take these boots
and a pair of socks. please.

528
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.066
Right. Socks. yeah.

529
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.066
Okay. here's the deal.

530
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.400
I have to photograph
at least four of the waterfalls

531
00:21:09.533 --> 00:21:12.800
by the end of the week.

532
00:21:12.934 --> 00:21:14.100
And not the simple ones--

533
00:21:14.233 --> 00:21:15.800
I need to capture the ones
that people don't see.

534
00:21:15.934 --> 00:21:18.400
Like. uh. Little Bessie.

535
00:21:18.533 --> 00:21:21.066
"Betsy." Little Betsy.

536
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.433
See? That's the point.

537
00:21:23.567 --> 00:21:25.433
I'm going to get it wrong
in the article.

538
00:21:25.567 --> 00:21:26.867
And. to top it off.

539
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.900
there's a high probability
that I'll get lost

540
00:21:29.033 --> 00:21:30.767
or eaten by a grizzly bear.

541
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.667
never seen again.

542
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.367
Ooh. in this neck of the woods.

543
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.500
grizzlies are no joking matter.

544
00:21:36.633 --> 00:21:38.500
Seriously?

545
00:21:38.633 --> 00:21:39.834
Bob. you better put
some bear spray in there.

546
00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:41.533
Good idea.

547
00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:43.567
Even more reason
why I need help.

548
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.767
[snorts] You're not very good
with rejection. are you?

549
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.367
Mm.

550
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.367
Uh. how much?

551

00:29:07.033 --> 00:29:09.600
Who is she?

733
00:29:09.734 --> 00:29:10.633
Damsel in distress.

734
00:29:10.767 --> 00:29:11.767
Helped her out.
lost on a trail.

735
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.867
All right. all right.
pipe down.

736
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.900
Hi.

737
00:29:18.033 --> 00:29:18.900
Hey there.

738
00:29:19.033 --> 00:29:20.200
You look. uh...

739
00:29:20.333 --> 00:29:22.200
really nice.

740
00:29:22.333 --> 00:29:23.300
Oh. thank you.

741
00:29:23.433 --> 00:29:26.266
Hi. I'm Peter.

742
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.433
-Hi!
-My apologies.

743
00:29:27.567 --> 00:29:29.200
This is my friend. Peter.

744
00:29:29.333 --> 00:29:30.567
Peter. Amy Atwater.

745
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.800
Charmed.

746
00:29:31.934 --> 00:29:33.667
[smooch]

747
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.767
Kiss of the hand--
old-school.

748
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.533
walk on the outside
of the sidewalk.

749
00:29:39.667 --> 00:29:41.367
and like to offer to pick up
the check on the first date.

750
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.700
Well. as female-forward
as I consider myself to be.

751
00:29:43.834 --> 00:29:47.500
I quite enjoy
all three gestures.

752
00:29:47.633 --> 00:29:49.533
I hope you are taking
notes. Mark.

753
00:29:49.667 --> 00:29:50.667
[chuckles awkwardly]

754
00:29:52.567 --> 00:29:54.500
Our resident charming
Mr. Debonair.

755
00:29:54.633 --> 00:29:57.333
[laughing]

756
00:29:57.467 --> 00:29:58.333
Beer delivery!

757
00:29:58.467 --> 00:29:59.767
Get 'em
while they are cold.

758
00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.233
You didn't have to do that.

759
00:30:01.367 --> 00:30:02.500
Except that I wanted to.

760
00:30:02.633 --> 00:30:06.166
Oh. Amy. this is Tara.

761
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.834
Tara. Amy.

762
00:30:07.967 --> 00:30:09.300
Hi.

763
00:30:09.433 --> 00:30:10.300
Tara's also a tour guide here.

764
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.834
You were fully booked.

765
00:30:13.967 --> 00:30:14.900
What can I say?
I'm in high demand.

766
00:30:15.033 --> 00:30:17.367
So. uh. is Kyra here?

767
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.834
Yeah. she's over there.

768
00:30:19.967 --> 00:30:21.900
doing her best impression
of a wall mural.

769
00:30:22.033 --> 00:30:24.633
Well. I'm. uh. gonna go say hi.

770
00:30:24.767 --> 00:30:26.934
but it was nice
to meet you. Tara.

771
00:30:27.066 --> 00:30:29.166
And so nice to meet you. too.

772
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.500
I'll come find you
in a bit.

773
00:30:30.633 --> 00:30:32.600
Uh. sounds good. Yeah.

774
00:30:33.834 --> 00:30:37.934
[♪♪]

775
00:30:38.066 --> 00:30:39.767
Hey. Kyra.

776
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.433
Amy.

777
00:30:41.567 --> 00:30:42.700
Hi.

778
00:30:42.834 --> 00:30:44.300
So... is he here?

779
00:30:44.433 --> 00:30:46.333
Who?

780
00:30:46.467 --> 00:30:47.667
I was once an 11-year-old girl.

781
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.734
and it seems to me

782
00:30:49.867 --> 00:30:51.266
like you're looking
for someone in particular.

783
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.700
Just this boy
I've met here.

784
00:30:53.834 --> 00:30:57.433
Hey. Kyra.

785
00:30:57.567 --> 00:30:58.867
Hi. Hunter.

786
00:30:59.667 --> 00:31:03.900
Taking that's him?

787
00:31:04.033 --> 00:31:05.734
Yeah.

788
00:31:05.867 --> 00:31:07.000
That was pretty nice of him
to say hi.

789
00:31:07.133 --> 00:31:09.467
But he didn't come over
and talk.

790
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.367
True.

791
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.767
Took a lot of courage for him
to say hello to you.

792
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.533
don't you think?

793
00:31:14.667 --> 00:31:15.500
I guess.

794
00:31:15.633 --> 00:31:17.533
Why don't you go
talk to him?

795
00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:19.934
[Kyra] Uh. no way.

796
00:31:20.066 --> 00:31:21.600
Ask him if he wants. like.
a soda or a lemonade.

797
00:31:21.734 --> 00:31:24.867
I can't.

798
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.400
Do you like him?

799
00:31:26.533 --> 00:31:28.500
Sort of.

800
00:31:28.633 --> 00:31:30.967
Okay. yes.

801
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.333
Then you need to go over there

802
00:31:32.467 --> 00:31:34.600
and tell him you wanna
be friends with him.

803
00:31:34.734 --> 00:31:36.433
Hang out.

804
00:31:36.567 --> 00:31:37.767
And the only way to do that
is to go on over there.

805
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.000
It might not seem like it
at your age.

806
00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:44.667
but life is too short

807
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.734
to let these moments
pass you by.

808
00:31:45.867 --> 00:31:48.333
Will you come with me?

809
00:31:48.467 --> 00:31:50.266
Sure. I will.

810
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.834
[nervously] Okay.

811
00:31:52.967 --> 00:31:57.266
[♪♪]

812
00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.467
[Kyra] Hey. um... Hunter?

813
00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.800
Yes?

814
00:32:02.934 --> 00:32:03.867
Well. um. I was wondering

815
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.500
if you wanted to go. um. maybe--

816
00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:08.834
Hey. Hunter! Are you coming?

817
00:32:08.967 --> 00:32:10.367
We're gonna go check out
the new dock.

818
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.734
Want to come?

819
00:32:12.867 --> 00:32:14.000
[girl] Hunter. come on!

820
00:32:14.133 --> 00:32:15.533
Um. no thanks.

821
00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.934
Okay. Well. bye.

822
00:32:18.066 --> 00:32:21.200
[softly] Bye.

823
00:32:23.066 --> 00:32:26.934
He asked you to go with him
to see the dock.

824
00:32:27.066 --> 00:32:29.533
Means nothing.

825
00:32:29.667 --> 00:32:30.667
[Amy] Hey...

826
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.734
I know a few things about boys.

827
00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:34.667
and he seems
to be pretty interested.

828
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.700
I'm gonna go get some lemonade.
Do you want any?

829
00:32:39.834 --> 00:32:42.533
Sure. Thanks.

830
00:32:42.667 --> 00:32:43.867
-Hi. Dad.
-Hey.

831
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.700
-She okay?
-I think so.

832
00:32:47.834 --> 00:32:49.000
I rarely trust
my own instincts.

833
00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:51.467
and I'm asking her
to take my advice.

834
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.300
At this stage.

835
00:32:53.433 --> 00:32:54.734
I'm guessing
it's better than mine.

836
00:32:54.867 --> 00:32:57.800
I'm sure
you get told this a lot.

837
00:32:57.934 --> 00:32:59.867
but she's a pretty awesome kid.

838
00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:02.467
Looks like
the feeling's mutual.

839
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.600
I can tell
she likes you a lot. too.

840
00:33:04.734 --> 00:33:06.133
You can?

841
00:33:06.266 --> 00:33:07.567
Yeah. I mean.
what's not to like?

842
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.367
Hey. uh...

843
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.834
I have a group hitting up
one of the more difficult

844
00:33:13.967 --> 00:33:15.767
to get to waterfalls tomorrow
Interested?

845
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.767
Of course.

846
00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.400
Do you like heights?

847
00:33:18.533 --> 00:33:19.867
Only if I'm attached
to something.

848
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.834
[♪♪]

849
00:33:25.834 --> 00:33:30.367
I don't think I can do this.

850
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.834
Yes. you can.

851
00:33:31.967 --> 00:33:33.066
-It's easy.
-You're 11!

852
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.967
life's too short to let
these moments pass you by."

853
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.567
Whoo-hoo!

854
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.467
Holy cow...

855
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.033
See? It's easy!

856
00:33:43.166 --> 00:33:44.567
[Mark] You don't have to jump
like supergirl there.

857
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.633
Just take it slow
One little bounce at a time.

858
00:33:47.767 --> 00:33:49.367
You'll be totally secure.

859
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.533
What if I accidentally
let go of the rope?

860
00:33:50.667 --> 00:33:53.600
-Definitely don't do that.
-Okay.

861
00:33:53.734 --> 00:33:54.867
[exhales deeply]

862
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.800
Hi. Rest of my group
get down safe?

863
00:33:56.934 --> 00:33:58.834
Yep. All safe.

864
00:33:58.967 --> 00:34:00.900
How's it going?

865
00:34:01.033 --> 00:34:01.900
Great.

866
00:34:02.033 --> 00:34:03.133
You nervous?

867
00:34:03.266 --> 00:34:04.166
Yeah!

868
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.133
See you at the bottom.

869
00:34:07.266 --> 00:34:09.433
Oh!

870
00:34:09.567 --> 00:34:10.667
Ohh... [panicking]

871
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.900
Okay. just ignore them.

872
00:34:15.033 --> 00:34:16.133
Go at your own pace.

873
00:34:16.266 --> 00:34:18.400
Push out. Legs out.

874
00:34:18.533 --> 00:34:22.600
I-I can't do this.

875
00:34:22.734 --> 00:34:24.066
Hey! You said as long as
you were attached to something.

876
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.867
I meant like a building.

877
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.800
Come on. conquer your fears.

878
00:34:28.934 --> 00:34:31.433
That's what I watch
horror movies for.

879
00:34:31.567 --> 00:34:32.767
Do you want to see
Falcon Falls or not?

880
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.867
[exhales darkly]

881
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Right.

882
00:34:37.133 --> 00:34:38.767
Okay.

883
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:42.133
Yeah.

884
00:34:42.266 --> 00:34:46.633
[carabiner rattling]

885
00:34:46.767 --> 00:34:48.367
You'll be fine.

886
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.533
-[chuckles dubiously]
-Okay?

887
00:34:49.667 --> 00:34:51.433
All right.

888
00:34:51.567 --> 00:34:53.000
[Kyra] You got this. Amy!

889
00:34:55.033 --> 00:34:59.066
[Amy exhales with resolve]

890
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.567
On the count of three.

891
00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.900
One...

892
00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:03.066
two...

893
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.800
...Three!

894
00:35:04.934 --> 00:35:06.567
[♪♪]

895
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.600
[yelling] I'm doing it!

896
00:35:08.734 --> 00:35:12.433
Whoo! Yeah!

897
00:35:12.567 --> 00:35:17.200
Whoo! Go. Amy!
You got this! Come on. Amy!

898
00:35:17.333 --> 00:35:20.166
Whoo!

899
00:35:21.266 --> 00:35:25.433
Whoo!

900
00:35:25.567 --> 00:35:28.767
Great job!

901
00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:29.900
Are you sure you've never
done that before?

902
00:35:30.033 --> 00:35:30.800
I swear!

903
00:35:30.934 --> 00:35:32.033
[Amy pants]

904
00:35:32.166 --> 00:35:33.066
That was incredible!

905
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.133
I couldn't have
done it on my own.

906
00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:36.667
There are a lot a people
who never go through with it.

907
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.867
-I'm proud of you.
-Yeah?

908
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.133
Thanks.
I'm proud of me. too.

909
00:35:40.266 --> 00:35:43.834
Uh. so we should probably
keep moving.

910
00:35:43.967 --> 00:35:45.533
We've still a big hike
ahead of us.

911
00:35:45.667 --> 00:35:47.133
[Amy. quietly]
That was so exhilarating.

912
00:35:47.266 --> 00:35:49.934
That feeling doesn't go away.

913
00:35:50.066 --> 00:35:51.500
no matter how many times
I do it.

914
00:35:51.633 --> 00:35:52.900
I feel like I just conquered
the Grim Reaper.

915
00:35:53.033 --> 00:35:55.100
You conquered
the climb to Falcon Falls.

916
00:35:55.233 --> 00:35:58.133
Welcome
to the rest of your life.

917
00:35:58.266 --> 00:36:02.066
Yes!

918
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.233
[♪♪]

919
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:13.166
[Amy] Every one
seems to make me awestruck.

920
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.900
It's like the harder
they are to get to.

921
00:36:16.033 --> 00:36:17.734
the more they preen.

922
00:36:17.867 --> 00:36:19.133
Yeah.

923
00:36:19.266 --> 00:36:22.600
So what's your take
on Mr. Falcon here?

924
00:36:22.734 --> 00:36:24.800
[Amy] The water cascades
differently than the other ones.

925
00:36:24.934 --> 00:36:28.934
And the rocks
are a lot smoother.

926
00:36:29.066 --> 00:36:32.033
and it feels like a cave
among an enchanted forest

927
00:36:32.166 --> 00:36:36.500
with a waterfall.

928
00:36:36.633 --> 00:36:38.667
[chuckles]

929
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.800
He's smooth talker. this one.

930
00:36:39.934 --> 00:36:41.533
Maybe even a little bit cocky.

931
00:36:41.667 --> 00:36:44.567
All that from a photograph?

932
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.033
Oh. well.

933
00:36:46.166 --> 00:36:47.567
the right photograph
can reveal a lot about someone.

934
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.600
Remind me never to let you
take photos of me.

935
00:36:50.734 --> 00:36:54.133
[snap]

936
00:36:54.266 --> 00:36:58.000
What?

937
00:36:58.133 --> 00:36:59.500
Oh. nothing.

938
00:36:59.633 --> 00:37:00.900
Hey. come on.
Let me see it.

939
00:37:01.033 --> 00:37:02.233
That's not fair.

940
00:37:02.367 --> 00:37:03.900
Okay. fine. Here you go.

941
00:37:04.033 --> 00:37:07.600
Do you think
I need to shave?

942
00:37:07.734 --> 00:37:09.467
[laughs]
No. I like the scruff.

943
00:37:12.233 --> 00:37:16.900
We better
catch up with the others.

944
00:37:17.033 --> 00:37:18.567
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

945
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.233
Mm-hmm.

946
00:37:19.367 --> 00:37:22.266
Okay.

947
00:37:23.767 --> 00:37:27.934
[♪♪]

948
00:37:32.433 --> 00:37:37.233
[Camilla]
It's excellent work. Amy.

949
00:37:37.367 --> 00:37:38.834
I told you
I'm not easily pleased.

950
00:37:38.967 --> 00:37:40.066
but you're doing
a fantastic job.

951
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.066
Thank you.

952
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.834
However. these waterfalls
have been published before.

953
00:37:43.967 --> 00:37:45.900
You know
what I'm looking for.

954
00:37:46.033 --> 00:37:47.567
I'm working on it.

955
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.266
Good. because we are expanding
this into a much bigger story.

956
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.567
"Mythical waterfalls revealed."

957
00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.800
Well. I have good source
that says they don't exist.

958
00:37:54.934 --> 00:37:58.200
That's because
they think they own them.

959
00:37:58.333 --> 00:38:00.166
But they don't.

960
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.734
Once you prove
that they do exist.

961
00:38:01.867 --> 00:38:03.800
you'll share in the rewards.

962
00:38:03.934 --> 00:38:05.200
I like the sounds of that.

963
00:38:05.333 --> 00:38:07.934
I'm also setting up
a new assignment for you.

964
00:38:08.066 --> 00:38:09.800
Santa Fe.

965
00:38:09.934 --> 00:38:10.734
Seriously?

966
00:38:10.867 --> 00:38:13.033
You've got three days to
get this one done.

967
00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:14.800
Count on it.

968
00:38:14.934 --> 00:38:18.100
Camilla. one of the photographs
I sent you--

969
00:38:18.233 --> 00:38:21.166
the one of the hummingbird--

970
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.633
Yes. Love it.

971
00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:23.867
I always like
a few complementary photographs

972
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.300
to go with the main subject.

973
00:38:25.433 --> 00:38:27.200
I didn't actually take that one

974
00:38:27.333 --> 00:38:28.633
and I want to make sure

975
00:38:28.767 --> 00:38:30.066
that the person who did
gets the right credit.

976
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.333
Perfect.
Just send the info to Ben

977
00:38:32.467 --> 00:38:33.700
and keep up the great work.

978
00:38:33.834 --> 00:38:35.033
I will. Thanks.

979
00:38:35.166 --> 00:38:37.233
-I gotta run.
-Bye.

980
00:38:38.433 --> 00:38:42.834
[text alert chimes]

981
00:38:42.967 --> 00:38:45.166
[chuckles]

982
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:54.033
[♪♪]

983
00:38:54.166 --> 00:38:56.767
Whoa...

984
00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.166
don't you look lovely
this evening?

985
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.200
Thanks. Leo.

986
00:39:00.333 --> 00:39:01.834
So. Angel and Redwood Falls.

987
00:39:01.967 --> 00:39:04.400
I've been trying
to get the scoop.

988
00:39:04.533 --> 00:39:07.000
but it's been tough.

989
00:39:07.133 --> 00:39:08.400
Okay. so here's the deal--

990
00:39:08.533 --> 00:39:10.400
Redwood Falls is. like.
top-notch secret up here.

991
00:39:10.533 --> 00:39:13.166
It's like no one talks about it.

992
00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.867
so it's a little difficult
to gauge

993
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.233
who has actually seen it.

994
00:39:16.367 --> 00:39:17.834
Really?

995
00:39:17.967 --> 00:39:19.000
Yeah. but if I was
a betting man.

996
00:39:19.133 --> 00:39:20.467
which I'm not.

997
00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.867
but if I was.

998
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.467
I'd say there's only one person
who works here

999
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.400
who has ever seen it.

1000
00:39:25.533 --> 00:39:28.000
One person...

1001
00:39:28.133 --> 00:39:30.000
Who shall remain nameless.

1002
00:39:30.133 --> 00:39:31.300
Right.

1003
00:39:31.433 --> 00:39:33.033
You have a good time. Amy.

1004
00:39:33.166 --> 00:39:34.900
Thanks. Leo.

1005
00:39:35.033 --> 00:39:37.433
[♪♪]

1006
00:39:41.166 --> 00:39:46.133
A local photographer
with a passion for waterfalls.

1007
00:39:46.266 --> 00:39:48.834
Small world.

1008
00:39:48.967 --> 00:39:50.967
You don't seem very impressed.

1009
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.333
I am. In fact...

1010
00:39:53.467 --> 00:39:55.400
it's inspiring.

1011
00:39:55.533 --> 00:39:57.834
You think she's that good?

1012
00:39:57.967 --> 00:39:59.867
Actually... not really.

1013
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.500
Oh.

1014
00:40:03.633 --> 00:40:05.133
I'm just being honest. sorry.

1015
00:40:05.266 --> 00:40:06.567
No. no. I-I like honest.

1016
00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.867
How is that "inspiring"?

1017
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.100
Well. this one.

1018
00:40:12.233 --> 00:40:14.266
I haven't seen
this waterfall before.

1019
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.233
Few have.

1020
00:40:17.367 --> 00:40:18.834
It's difficult to get to.

1021
00:40:18.967 --> 00:40:20.266
Protecting
our treasures around here

1022
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.433
is not something
we joke about.

1023
00:40:21.567 --> 00:40:24.000
I'll be sure to remember that w
you take me there.

1024
00:40:24.133 --> 00:40:27.066
We were talking
about the photographs.

1025
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.967
What don't you like about 'em?

1026
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.233
Uh. okay.

1027
00:40:31.367 --> 00:40:35.834
She hasn't captured them.

1028
00:40:35.967 --> 00:40:38.934
Like. there's no personalities
in these portraits.

1029
00:40:39.066 --> 00:40:41.533
Hmm.

1030
00:40:41.667 --> 00:40:42.533
Yeah. I kind of agree.

1031
00:40:42.667 --> 00:40:45.333
Angel Falls is unlike any of
the others.

1032
00:40:45.467 --> 00:40:47.967
This is Angel Falls?

1033
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.166
You've heard of it?

1034
00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.333
I've heard it's as elusive
as Redwood Falls.

1035
00:40:51.467 --> 00:40:54.900
Not quite.

1036
00:40:55.033 --> 00:40:56.200
As you can see. it does exist.

1037
00:40:56.333 --> 00:40:59.333
It is rare.

1038
00:40:59.467 --> 00:41:01.300
And spectacular.

1039
00:41:01.433 --> 00:41:03.367
And very hard to get to.

1040
00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:11.567
Can you take me there?

1041
00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.567
Please.

1042
00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.033
Well...

1043
00:41:15.166 --> 00:41:17.433
I do think she deserves
a better portrait than that.

1044
00:41:17.567 --> 00:41:21.000
And you are
a much better photographer.

1045
00:41:21.133 --> 00:41:23.200
no offense
to our local artist.

1046
00:41:23.333 --> 00:41:24.667
Thank you.

1047
00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.133
All right.

1048
00:41:26.266 --> 00:41:27.934
Under one condition.

1049
00:41:28.066 --> 00:41:29.033
That I don't tell anyone
how I found it?

1050
00:41:29.166 --> 00:41:31.133
That too.

1051
00:41:31.266 --> 00:41:32.567
There's a crescent moon
this evening.

1052
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.100
visible just before sunset.

1053
00:41:35.233 --> 00:41:37.367
Shines an awesome hue of orange.
like you've never seen before.

1054
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.266
Another tradition around here--

1055
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.066
you have to swear
the oath of honor.

1056
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.667
[scoffing chuckle]

1057
00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.033
There sure are
a lot of rules around here.

1058
00:41:45.166 --> 00:41:47.266
Take it or leave it.

1059
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.266
I'll take it.

1060
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.567
How about now?

1061
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.266
What are we waiting for?

1062
00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.667
[♪♪]

1063
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.266
I could get used to this.

1064
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.100
I know.

1065
00:42:07.233 --> 00:42:11.600
You'll be gone
in a few days. won't you?

1066
00:42:11.734 --> 00:42:14.200
[exhaling deeply]

1067
00:42:14.333 --> 00:42:15.734
I feel like I'm a million miles
away from home.

1068
00:42:15.867 --> 00:42:18.533
This place has
that effect on people.

1069
00:42:18.667 --> 00:42:22.567
Maybe you should stay
a little longer.

1070
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.500
I just got a promotion.

1071
00:42:24.633 --> 00:42:26.967
And my boss likes my photos.

1072
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.600
and she's sending me
on another assignment.

1073
00:42:29.734 --> 00:42:32.633
You don't seem very excited.

1074
00:42:32.767 --> 00:42:34.500
I am.

1075
00:42:34.633 --> 00:42:37.066
I think I am.

1076
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.200
Actually. I don't know
how I feel about it.

1077
00:42:40.333 --> 00:42:43.200
Why?

1078
00:42:43.333 --> 00:42:45.133
I'm getting paid
to take photos.

1079
00:42:45.266 --> 00:42:47.467
and that's my passion.

1080
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.133
and I'm grateful for that.

1081
00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:52.533
But?

1082
00:42:52.667 --> 00:42:54.467
Being at that gallery.
if I'm gonna be honest.

1083
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.133
that is what I would love to do.

1084
00:42:58.266 --> 00:43:00.300
I know I wouldn't
make a lot of money.

1085
00:43:00.433 --> 00:43:02.600
but I could be my own artist.

1086
00:43:02.734 --> 00:43:04.600
and that's what inspired me.

1087
00:43:04.734 --> 00:43:06.533
Then you should do it.

1088
00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:08.266
And I'm not kidding--
you are way better.

1089
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.033
I wouldn't even know
where to start.

1090
00:43:11.166 --> 00:43:13.133
Start by taking
a leap of faith.

1091
00:43:13.266 --> 00:43:14.800
Just like going down
the face of that rock.

1092
00:43:14.934 --> 00:43:18.166
Well. that's because
you were my safety net.

1093
00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.266
Safety net. huh?

1094
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.734
Mm. Or pep talker.

1095
00:43:21.867 --> 00:43:23.467
Whichever one suits you best.

1096
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.567
Hmm. I think I'll take both.

1097
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.467
[chuckles]

1098
00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.100
Come on.

1099
00:43:29.233 --> 00:43:30.300
Let's continue this conversation
over some water.

1100
00:43:30.433 --> 00:43:33.600
Some water?

1101
00:43:33.734 --> 00:43:35.600
[♪♪]

1102
00:43:38.834 --> 00:43:43.166
Look. I did it.

1103
00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.433
I had a corporate job
behind a desk.

1104
00:43:45.567 --> 00:43:49.033
making more money
than I could spend.

1105
00:43:49.166 --> 00:43:51.066
Came up here to get away.
clear my mind after my divorce.

1106
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.433
And it became so obvious to me
what I was missing in my life.

1107
00:43:55.567 --> 00:43:59.300
And what were you missing?

1108
00:43:59.433 --> 00:44:00.567
Myself.

1109
00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.367
There isn't a second turn on
the merry-go-round Amy.

1110
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.900
You gotta know what you want.

1111
00:44:07.734 --> 00:44:12.467
I really need
to ask you this. Mark.

1112
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.800
Have you seen it?

1113
00:44:14.934 --> 00:44:17.467
Redwood Falls?

1114
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.633
You can trust me.

1115
00:44:19.767 --> 00:44:21.333
Okay? I mean.

1116
00:44:21.467 --> 00:44:22.567
I won't tell anyone
if you have.

1117
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.800
I just...
I've gotta know.

1118
00:44:25.934 --> 00:44:29.000
Does it exist?

1119
00:44:30.533 --> 00:44:34.500
It does.

1120
00:44:34.633 --> 00:44:35.667
Redwood Falls exists?

1121
00:44:37.033 --> 00:44:39.100
I'm one of the few people
to have ever found it.

1122
00:44:39.233 --> 00:44:41.767
It was by accident.

1123
00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.433
I was just out
exploring south of Angel Falls.

1124
00:44:43.567 --> 00:44:46.600
actually thought I was lost
for a little while.

1125
00:44:46.734 --> 00:44:49.166
And then I saw
this strange rock--

1126
00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.367
well...

1127
00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.233
it was more like two of them.
twisted together.

1128
00:44:53.367 --> 00:44:56.367
One of the old-timers
calls it "Twisted Sister".

1129
00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.600
[laughs]

1130
00:44:58.734 --> 00:45:00.600
So. I had heard from a friend.

1131
00:45:00.734 --> 00:45:03.333
who had heard
from his grandfather.

1132
00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:05.400
who had heard
from his grandmother.

1133
00:45:05.533 --> 00:45:07.867
that if you follow your compass
at 212 degrees from that rock.

1134
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.700
Redwood Falls
isn't far from there.

1135
00:45:12.834 --> 00:45:16.333
That number always
stuck in my mind

1136
00:45:16.467 --> 00:45:18.266
because
it's the exact temperature--

1137
00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.767
...That water boils.

1138
00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.266
Exactly.

1139
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.934
I've found that nature
has a funny sense of humor.

1140
00:45:25.066 --> 00:45:26.934
Anyway.
I followed that direction.

1141
00:45:27.066 --> 00:45:28.834
and there it was.

1142
00:45:28.967 --> 00:45:30.467
Along with the unicorns.

1143
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.934
That's right.

1144
00:45:32.066 --> 00:45:33.734
I didn't mean to pretend
I hadn't been there. but...

1145
00:45:33.867 --> 00:45:38.533
a place like that
is just legendary.

1146
00:45:38.667 --> 00:45:41.667
Legendary?

1147
00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.233
Yeah. it's hard to explain.

1148
00:45:43.367 --> 00:45:44.900
Both Angel and Redwood are.

1149
00:45:45.033 --> 00:45:47.233
Words don't do justice

1150
00:45:47.367 --> 00:45:49.333
to describe
either of those falls.

1151
00:45:49.467 --> 00:45:50.467
Are you gonna take me there?

1152
00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.367
To Angel Falls. as agreed.

1153
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.367
Redwood
is a whole other exploration.

1154
00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.867
and truth be told.

1155
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.600
I don't even know
if I'd be able to find it again.

1156
00:45:58.734 --> 00:46:02.400
I don't know whether
you're telling me the truth.

1157
00:46:02.533 --> 00:46:05.500
but I'm gonna go with it.

1158
00:46:05.633 --> 00:46:08.533
so. Angel Falls.

1159
00:46:08.667 --> 00:46:10.700
And only after
you've sworn an oath.

1160
00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:13.367
[oars clank
as he rests them]

1161
00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:14.567
Right. The swearing-in.

1162
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.734
Raise your right hand.

1163
00:46:16.867 --> 00:46:18.333
[sighs]

1164
00:46:18.467 --> 00:46:19.734
Amy Atwater...

1165
00:46:19.867 --> 00:46:21.400
do you solemnly swear

1166
00:46:21.533 --> 00:46:23.300
that if I take you
to Angel Falls.

1167
00:46:23.433 --> 00:46:24.867
you will not reveal
its location to anyone.

1168
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.734
I swear.

1169
00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:28.000
Cross your heart?

1170
00:46:28.133 --> 00:46:29.433
Hope to die.

1171
00:46:29.567 --> 00:46:30.500
Well. don't die too soon.

1172
00:46:30.633 --> 00:46:32.400
I only just met you.

1173
00:46:32.533 --> 00:46:33.834
[multiple text alerts chime]

1174
00:46:33.967 --> 00:46:37.734
Ah. It's Tara.

1175
00:46:37.867 --> 00:46:39.700
Just texting hello.

1176
00:46:39.834 --> 00:46:41.000
Oh. Right.

1177
00:46:41.133 --> 00:46:42.867
Tara.

1178
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.467
So. I've been meaning to ask.

1179
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.266
is she a...?

1180
00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.233
A "was".

1181
00:46:50.367 --> 00:46:51.633
Sort of. Used to be.

1182
00:46:51.767 --> 00:46:54.367
Girlfriend?

1183
00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.700
A few dates.
but it didn't work.

1184
00:46:55.834 --> 00:46:58.400
She's a great gal.

1185
00:46:58.533 --> 00:47:00.433
but we're better suited
as friends.

1186
00:47:00.567 --> 00:47:02.834
which I told her.

1187
00:47:02.967 --> 00:47:05.000
But if I'm being honest.

1188
00:47:05.133 --> 00:47:07.333
I'm not so sure
she sees it that way.

1189
00:47:07.467 --> 00:47:09.934
I understand.

1190
00:47:10.066 --> 00:47:13.900
Thank you for bringing me.

1191
00:47:14.033 --> 00:47:16.367
This is...

1192
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.800
awesome.

1193
00:47:17.934 --> 00:47:19.500
Your boss'll be happy.

1194
00:47:19.633 --> 00:47:22.133
Or maybe I'll just save it
for my gallery.

1195
00:47:29.333 --> 00:47:33.200
[Penny]
You went rock-climbing?

1196
00:47:33.333 --> 00:47:34.934
I know. right?

1197
00:47:35.066 --> 00:47:36.066
I'm serious. Penny.

1198
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.834
I think I'm hooked.

1199
00:47:37.967 --> 00:47:39.200
[laughs]
Well. whatever you're doing.

1200
00:47:39.333 --> 00:47:40.567
keep at it.

1201
00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:41.567
The boss is happy.

1202
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:42.800
I know.
"Careful what you wish for."

1203
00:47:42.934 --> 00:47:45.500
What do you mean by that?

1204
00:47:45.633 --> 00:47:47.066
Nothing.

1205
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.500
I thought you had
another three days.

1206
00:47:48.633 --> 00:47:49.934
Why are you packing?

1207
00:47:50.066 --> 00:47:51.000
Oh. uh...

1208
00:47:51.133 --> 00:47:52.000
well. it's an overnight.

1209
00:47:52.133 --> 00:47:53.900
to get to one of
the mystic falls.

1210
00:47:54.033 --> 00:47:56.133
It has been rarely photographed.

1211
00:47:56.266 --> 00:47:58.066
so Camilla is going to love it.

1212
00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.266
Wait. you're going camping
now. too?

1213
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.600
Yeah!

1214
00:48:02.734 --> 00:48:03.533
By yourself?

1215
00:48:03.667 --> 00:48:05.233
No.

1216
00:48:05.367 --> 00:48:06.967
Okay. clearly. you're not
telling me everything.

1217
00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.100
I have a guide.
It's no big deal.

1218
00:48:09.233 --> 00:48:12.000
I've dated
a lot of no-big-deals.

1219
00:48:12.133 --> 00:48:13.867
What's his name.

1220
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:14.934
and what does he look like?

1221
00:48:15.066 --> 00:48:16.133
Penny...

1222
00:48:16.266 --> 00:48:17.133
Spill it!

1223
00:48:17.266 --> 00:48:18.500
His name is Mark.

1224
00:48:18.633 --> 00:48:19.867
and he is
ridiculously attractive.

1225
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.800
and his daughter
is ridiculously sweet.

1226
00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:27.567
And...

1227
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.166
ridiculously enough.

1228
00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.967
he has a an ex-girlfriend
who doesn't want to be an ex.

1229
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.000
Ex-girlfriend?

1230
00:48:34.133 --> 00:48:35.600
Sounds complicated.

1231
00:48:35.734 --> 00:48:36.800
Yeah. I didn't ask
for details.

1232
00:48:36.934 --> 00:48:39.200
Sounds to me like you're--

1233
00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:41.166
I'm hopelessly head over heels
in love with him?

1234
00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.500
I know.

1235
00:48:44.633 --> 00:48:45.800
It's awesome.

1236
00:48:45.934 --> 00:48:46.934
No! It's not!

1237
00:48:47.066 --> 00:48:48.767
Penny.

1238
00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:49.934
Why now? Why here?

1239
00:48:50.066 --> 00:48:51.667
I'm here
for just three more days.

1240
00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.767
It's all just a fantasy.

1241
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.800
Enjoy the fantasy.

1242
00:48:55.934 --> 00:48:57.767
Because. trust me.

1243
00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:59.100
it's usually better
than the real thing.

1244
00:48:59.233 --> 00:49:00.900
I might sound crazy.

1245
00:49:01.033 --> 00:49:02.900
but the idea
of meeting the right guy

1246
00:49:03.033 --> 00:49:06.934
seems more elusive
than finding Redwood Falls.

1247
00:49:07.066 --> 00:49:10.800
Redwood Falls?

1248
00:49:10.934 --> 00:49:12.800
Never mind.

1249
00:49:12.934 --> 00:49:14.233
I gotta go.

1250
00:49:14.367 --> 00:49:15.700
Good luck. Ames.

1251
00:49:15.834 --> 00:49:17.300

1255

for this conservation
program. Dad.

1256
00:49:34.934 --> 00:49:36.734
"Excited" is an understatement.

1257

a friend in the program.

00:50:15.133 --> 00:50:16.600
[chuckling]

1275
00:50:16.734 --> 00:50:17.700
You need a break?

1276
00:50:17.834 --> 00:50:18.800
I can keep going.

1277
00:50:18.934 --> 00:50:20.200
You sure?

1278
00:50:20.333 --> 00:50:21.567
Maybe you need a break...

1279
00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.633
maybe that's why
you're bringing it up.

1280
00:50:23.767 --> 00:50:25.633
You know what?
Let's stop for a spell.

1281
00:50:25.767 --> 00:50:28.667
"For a spell"?

1282
00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.800
Oh. shall we indulge

1283
00:50:30.934 --> 00:50:32.834
in a mint julep on the veranda
betwixt the two columns?

1284
00:50:32.967 --> 00:50:36.667
Very funny.

1285
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.367
I guess ther
[laughs]

1286
00:50:39.166 --> 00:50:41.266
Mm. It befits you.

1287
00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.033
"Befits"?

1288
00:50:43.166 --> 00:50:44.900
Did you know
my grandfather. too?

1289
00:50:45.033 --> 00:50:46.900
Sounds distinguished.

1290
00:50:47.033 --> 00:50:49.166
He was a distinguished man.

1291
00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.767
Loved the outdoors.

1292
00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.300
We did a lot of camping
when I was a kid.

1293
00:50:54.433 --> 00:50:56.200
Funny how you can be influenced

1294
00:50:56.333 --> 00:50:58.033
in ways
you don't even know at the time.

1295
00:50:58.166 --> 00:51:00.066
That's sweet.

1296
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.867
Yeah. I miss him.

1297
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.834
I'm very close with my dad.

1298
00:51:03.967 --> 00:51:05.700
but there's something
about a grandparent

1299
00:51:05.834 --> 00:51:07.800
that's hard to replace.

1300
00:51:07.934 --> 00:51:09.000
I feel the same way
about my grandparents.

1301
00:51:09.133 --> 00:51:11.734
Is that where
you got the photo bug?

1302
00:51:11.867 --> 00:51:13.633
In a roundabout way.

1303
00:51:13.767 --> 00:51:15.300
I was about Kyra's age

1304
00:51:15.433 --> 00:51:18.166
when I helped them
go through the attic.

1305
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:22.000
and I came across

1306
00:51:22.133 --> 00:51:24.367
this big box
full of photographs--

1307
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:27.667
people from. like.
a hundred years ago.

1308
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.266
black-and-white--

1309
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.800
and I was mesmerized.

1310
00:51:30.934 --> 00:51:34.133
The entire history
of these people's lives

1311
00:51:34.266 --> 00:51:36.767
and personalities

1312
00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.000
just captured
in this one image.

1313
00:51:38.133 --> 00:51:41.700
I've been hooked ever since.

1314
00:51:41.834 --> 00:51:44.266
Well. a hundred years from now.

1315
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.066
your grandkids are gonna
look back on your photos.

1316
00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.200
thinking the same thing.

1317
00:51:49.333 --> 00:51:50.367
[laughs]

1318
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.333
I couldn't have done this
without you. Mark.

1319
00:51:53.467 --> 00:51:55.734
I'd probably still be. uh.
doing circles

1320
00:51:55.867 --> 00:51:57.967
around the first waterfall.

1321
00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:59.934
[both laughing]

1322
00:52:00.133 --> 00:52:01.700
There's a saying up here--

1323
00:52:01.834 --> 00:52:03.367
"It's easy to get lost.

1324
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.233
but if you let yourself go...

1325
00:52:05.367 --> 00:52:08.166
it's easier to be found."

1326
00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.967
I like that.

1327
00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:13.433
Ready?

1328
00:52:13.567 --> 00:52:14.800
You're the one
who wanted a break. not me.

1329
00:52:14.934 --> 00:52:17.300
Yeah.

1330
00:52:17.433 --> 00:52:18.367
Right.

1331
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.300
But first...

1332
00:52:21.433 --> 00:52:22.467
What?

1333
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.467
Again?

1334
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.200
[chuckles] Told ya.

1335
00:52:25.333 --> 00:52:26.367
Can't have you
remembering the way in.

1336
00:52:28.533 --> 00:52:33.066
You do this to everybody?

1337
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.133
What about bears?

1338
00:52:38.266 --> 00:52:40.066
Clap.

1339
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.200
I'm serious.

1340
00:52:41.333 --> 00:52:42.800
This is nature.

1341
00:52:42.934 --> 00:52:44.300
If this planet's gonna survive.

1342
00:52:44.433 --> 00:52:45.433
we need to co-exist
with our bears.

1343
00:52:45.567 --> 00:52:47.800
With all animals.
for that matter.

1344
00:52:47.934 --> 00:52:49.467
Put away our food.

1345
00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.200
and when we go to the bathroom.

1346
00:52:51.333 --> 00:52:53.300
we clap

1347
00:52:53.433 --> 00:52:54.433
like we have been
on the trail.

1348
00:52:54.567 --> 00:52:56.300
Well. what if there's a bear?

1349
00:52:56.433 --> 00:52:58.834
Run. Faster than me.
if you want to live.

1350
00:52:58.967 --> 00:53:01.000
Another bad dad joke.

1351
00:53:01.133 --> 00:53:04.200
I thought it was pretty funny.

1352
00:53:07.467 --> 00:53:12.066
Oh. and another word of advice?

1353
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.066
I'm all ears.

1354
00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.800
As tempting as it may be
to enjoy

1355
00:53:16.934 --> 00:53:19.867
the rest of
this beautiful sunset.

1356
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
you'll be eaten alive.

1357
00:53:22.133 --> 00:53:23.300
And not by bears.

1358
00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:25.133
Mosquitoes out here
are merciless.

1359
00:53:25.266 --> 00:53:27.000
Isn't that
what bug spray is for?

1360
00:53:27.133 --> 00:53:29.066
You need a hazmat.
trust me.

1361
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.900
They will carry you away.

1362
00:53:31.033 --> 00:53:32.367
and I am too tired
to rescue you.

1363
00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.133
Well. lucky for you.

1364
00:53:34.266 --> 00:53:36.500
I am so tired.
I don't even think

1365
00:53:36.633 --> 00:53:38.100
I'll make it
to my sleeping bag.

1366
00:53:38.233 --> 00:53:41.467
Oh... and. uh.
one more thing.

1367
00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:44.533
Snakes?

1368
00:53:44.667 --> 00:53:48.233
I'm flattered.
but we just met.

1369
00:53:48.367 --> 00:53:50.266
Just open it.

1370
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.133
[paper rustles]

1371
00:53:58.533 --> 00:54:02.533
Wow.

1372
00:54:02.667 --> 00:54:04.200
This is...

1373
00:54:04.333 --> 00:54:06.000
A compass.

1374
00:54:06.133 --> 00:54:07.600
I know.

1375
00:54:07.734 --> 00:54:09.533
'Cause you never know

1376
00:54:09.667 --> 00:54:10.834
when you're gonna need
some direction.

1377
00:54:10.967 --> 00:54:12.467
And funny enough.

1378
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.033
it always points toward me--

1379
00:54:14.166 --> 00:54:16.066
North.

1380
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.100
Well. Mr. Mark North.

1381
00:54:18.233 --> 00:54:21.300
I'll always know
where to find you.

1382
00:54:21.433 --> 00:54:25.433
Thanks.

1383
00:54:25.567 --> 00:54:26.500
You're welcome.

1384
00:54:26.633 --> 00:54:29.834
Another long hike tomorrow.

1385
00:54:29.967 --> 00:54:32.233
Well. I'm up for the challenge.

1386
00:54:32.367 --> 00:54:35.066
And now
that we're exchanging gifts...

1387
00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.400
how do you feel...

1388
00:54:38.533 --> 00:54:40.967
...about...

1389
00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.200
two-bite brownies?

1390
00:54:42.333 --> 00:54:44.166
Ohh. Don't mind if I do.

1391
00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.433
Mm-hmm.

1392
00:54:46.567 --> 00:54:47.834
Cheers.

1393
00:54:47.967 --> 00:54:50.734

1394
00:54:52.967 --> 00:54:56.600
Goodnight!

1395
00:54:56.734 --> 00:54:59.200
Goodnight!

1396
00:54:59.333 --> 00:55:00.500
[chuckles softly]

[yawning]

1404
00:55:39.834 --> 00:55:41.700
Morning.

1405
00:55:41.834 --> 00:55:43.133
Oh. good morning.

1406
00:55:43.266 --> 00:55:45.367
Coffee?

1407
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:46.734
Yes! Thank you.

1408
00:55:47.967 --> 00:55:52.266
How'd you sleep?

1409
00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.600
Oh. like a baby.

1410
00:55:53.734 --> 00:55:56.700
Once my head hit the pillow.

1411
00:55:56.834 --> 00:55:58.533
I didn't open up my eyes
until about five minutes ago.

1412
00:55:59.367 --> 00:56:03.400
Right.

1413
00:56:03.533 --> 00:56:05.266
Sorry.

1414
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:07.333
How do you like your eggs?

1415
00:56:07.467 --> 00:56:10.600
Scrambled.

1416
00:56:10.734 --> 00:56:11.934
Good choice.

1417
00:56:12.066 --> 00:56:16.834
You really know
your way around here.

1418
00:56:16.967 --> 00:56:19.633
I was born
with an internal compass.

1419
00:56:19.767 --> 00:56:23.233
Real one comes in handy.
too. though.

1420
00:56:23.367 --> 00:56:24.667
If it wasn't for my GPS.

1421
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.367
I wouldn't make it
out of my driveway.

1422
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:28.533
Ha! Well. there's
no cell reception up here.

1423
00:56:28.667 --> 00:56:30.934
So what if something happens?

1424
00:56:31.066 --> 00:56:33.333
Walkie-talkie.

1425
00:56:33.467 --> 00:56:35.266
Strong enough
to reach the lodge.

1426
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:36.800
if I needed to.

1427
00:56:36.934 --> 00:56:38.333
You ever had to use it?

1428
00:56:38.467 --> 00:56:39.667
I don't even know
if it works.

1429
00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.500
Great.

1430
00:56:41.633 --> 00:56:42.800
So we're not far.

1431
00:56:42.934 --> 00:56:44.767
There's a pretty nice view
up there.

1432
00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:47.600
Or there's another one
that way.

1433
00:56:47.734 --> 00:56:50.500
takes a little longer to get to.
but it's worth it.

1434
00:56:50.633 --> 00:56:53.533
I trust you.

1435
00:56:53.667 --> 00:56:55.467
All right.
Well. first...

1436
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.633
You do know
you gave me a compass. right?

1437
00:56:58.767 --> 00:57:01.367
I do.

1438
00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:02.600
But this...

1439
00:57:05.133 --> 00:57:07.400
Oh. come on.

1440
00:57:07.533 --> 00:57:09.567
Isn't this dangerous?

1441
00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:11.233
Don't worry.

1442
00:57:11.367 --> 00:57:12.900
Just take my hand.

1443
00:57:13.033 --> 00:57:14.500
I gotcha.

1444
00:57:14.633 --> 00:57:18.867
[Amy] You do know.
if I break my leg.

1445
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.400
you're gonna
have to carry me out?

1446
00:57:20.533 --> 00:57:22.000
[Mark] All right.

1447
00:57:24.834 --> 00:57:29.000
[♪♪]

1448
00:57:31.967 --> 00:57:36.333
What do you think?

1449
00:57:36.467 --> 00:57:37.767
I can't believe

1450
00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.734
something this beautiful
exists.

1451
00:57:39.867 --> 00:57:42.700
I feel like the luckiest girl
in the world right now.

1452
00:57:42.834 --> 00:57:47.266
Where we're standing.

1453
00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.500
it's my second-most
favorite place on Earth.

1454
00:57:49.633 --> 00:57:52.033
What could possibly outdo this?

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.667
I did the final layout.

1813
01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.367
Meant to take things out.

1814
01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:55.900
It really was a mistake.

1815
01:13:56.033 --> 01:13:57.166
So. see.
just tell them that.

1816
01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.300
Please.
blame it on your stupid boss.

1817
01:13:59.433 --> 01:14:01.867
You have no idea
what you did.

1818
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Calm down. Amy.

1819
01:14:05.133 --> 01:14:06.333
No. I am not
going to calm down.

1820
01:14:06.467 --> 01:14:08.967
Amy. your never going to see
any of these people again anyway

1821
01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.900
You are leaving today.

1822
01:14:11.033 --> 01:14:12.133
A new assignment.

1823
01:14:12.266 --> 01:14:13.800
So. looking at this
as a cup half-full.

1824
01:14:13.934 --> 01:14:15.800
I'd say you got
everything you wanted.

1825
01:14:15.934 --> 01:14:17.467
A congratulations
is in order.

1826
01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.200
Amy?

1827
01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:22.467
Are you still there?

1828
01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.367
We're very eager to see

1829
01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:25.734
what you're gonna come up with
in Santa Fe.

1830
01:14:25.867 --> 01:14:27.200
Ben's gonna email
your itinerary right now.

1831
01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:32.400
Amy? Are you there?

1832
01:14:32.533 --> 01:14:34.066
[shakily] I gotta go.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.867
Do you have
a three of diamonds?

1836
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.767
Go fish.

1837
01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.000
[grumbles] Are you cheating?

1838
01:14:50.133 --> 01:14:53.934
[door opens]

1839
01:14:54.066 --> 01:14:56.066
Hey. Leo. Hey. Kyra.

1840
01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.867
Hi.

[door shuts]

1842
01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.166
Can I have a minute?

1843
01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:02.467
Yeah.
I should get back to work.

1844
01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:05.867
Thanks.

1845
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.233
I guess
you're pretty mad at me.

1846
01:15:07.367 --> 01:15:10.333
No. I'm not mad at you.

1847
01:15:10.467 --> 01:15:12.533
I know you didn't do it
on purpose.

1848
01:15:12.667 --> 01:15:15.333
I came to see you earlier.

1849
01:15:15.467 --> 01:15:17.967
I heard you on the phone.

1850
01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:21.233
I didn't want to interrupt.

1851
01:15:21.367 --> 01:15:24.533
It's still my fault.

1852
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.867
Where's your dad?

1853
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.367
He's out on a tour.

1854
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.133
I wanted to explain to him
what happened.

1855
01:15:35.266 --> 01:15:38.900
He'll be back this afternoon?

1856
01:15:39.033 --> 01:15:40.333
[inhales sharply]

1857
01:15:40.467 --> 01:15:41.767
I gotta catch a flight.

1858
01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.066
Do you really have to go?

1859
01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.767
I mean. maybe you can stay
for a little bit?

1860
01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:49.100
I wish I could stay.

1861
01:15:49.233 --> 01:15:51.300
Me too.

1862
01:15:51.433 --> 01:15:54.233
Well. my dad's not far.

1863
01:15:54.367 --> 01:15:56.367
He took the group
to Falcon Falls.

1864
01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.300
That's the second waterfall
you went to.

1865
01:15:58.433 --> 01:16:01.233
I could take you there.

1866
01:16:01.367 --> 01:16:02.500
We'll probably catch them
on the way back.

1867
01:16:02.633 --> 01:16:05.433
I'd love to say yes.

1868
01:16:05.567 --> 01:16:07.033
but I think
it's best if I didn't.

1869
01:16:07.166 --> 01:16:09.000
And please.

1870
01:16:09.133 --> 01:16:11.000
tell him I'm sorry.

1871
01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:12.467
And goodbye for me.

1872
01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.533
Okay.

1873
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.300
Oh. um...
I almost forgot.

1874

Congratulations.

1875
01:16:24.333 --> 01:16:26.467
For what?

1876
01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.333
Your photo made it
into the article

1877
01:16:28.467 --> 01:16:30.533
with your name under it.

1878
01:16:30.667 --> 01:16:33.867
You should be very proud
of yourself.

1879
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.066
Bye.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.567

Hey...

Hey.

You okay?

1888
01:18:16.433 --> 01:18:17.367
-Yeah. I'm fine.
-Did you hear?

1889
01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.300
A van pulled up
a little bit ago--

1890
01:18:19.433 --> 01:18:21.533
an entire group already
setting out to find Angel Falls.

1891
01:18:21.667 --> 01:18:23.967
Yeah. I did hear that.

1892
01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.300
Well. let's just
hope I'm wrong

1893
01:18:26.433 --> 01:18:27.667
and they respect it
as much as we do.

1894
01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.300
Yeah.

1895
01:18:29.433 --> 01:18:32.066
You seen Amy?

1896
01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.300
Uh. pretty sure she left.

1897
01:18:33.433 --> 01:18:35.367
She didn't say goodbye?

1898
01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.500
Her car's still
in the parking lot.

1899
01:18:36.633 --> 01:18:39.800
Haven't seen her.

1900
01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.567
Do you know that new dance
that goes like this?

1901
01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:48.033
Oh. yeah.
Yeah. I've seen it.

1902

Yeah. like that. right?

1903
01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.133

Hey. Kyra.
Hey. Hunter.

1905
01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.000
Dad. you really
shouldn't be mad at Amy.

1906
01:18:54.133 --> 01:18:57.000
Yeah. it's a funny thing.

1907
01:18:57.133 --> 01:18:59.633
'cause I'm having a hard time
staying mad at her.

1908
01:18:59.767 --> 01:19:01.433
Well. she feels really bad
about what happened.

1909
01:19:01.567 --> 01:19:04.433
I know.

1910
01:19:04.567 --> 01:19:06.133
And it wasn't her fault.

1911
01:19:06.266 --> 01:19:08.200
I overheard her
talking on the phone.

1912
01:19:08.333 --> 01:19:10.500
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

1913
01:19:10.633 --> 01:19:12.467
but she was talking to her boss.

1914
01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.700
They tricked her.

1915
01:19:14.834 --> 01:19:16.233
and she didn't know
that they were gonna

1916
01:19:16.367 --> 01:19:18.734
put the location of Angel Falls
in the article.

1917
01:19:18.867 --> 01:19:21.300
She told them not to.

1918
01:19:21.433 --> 01:19:23.333
Have you seen Amy?

1919
01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:25.300
She left this morning.

1920
01:19:25.433 --> 01:19:27.100

still in the parking lot.

01:19:28.834 --> 01:19:30.100
