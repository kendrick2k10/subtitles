MARK: Everyone

16
00:02:50.648 --> 00:02:51.997
wants you to believe

17
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:54.348
that the key to a good life
is a nicer job.

or a selfie at the beach.

20
00:02:58.961 --> 00:03:02.921
The message is that a better
life is about more. more. more.

21
00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:04.836
Buy more. own more.

22
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.839

Give a fuck about low-fat milk.

25
00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:17.545
Give a fuck
about 5G and the G8.

This is me... Mark Manson.

It had "fuck" on the cover.

37
00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.506
of my not particularly
exceptional life.

38
00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.596
Shitty teenage years.
getting dumped. friends dying.

39
00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.772
a culture that sucked me
into a drain hole

40
00:04:10.815 --> 00:04:13.122
of my own pain and entitlement.

41
00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:15.690
and ultimately.
the "fuck you" spiritual advice

42
00:04:15.733 --> 00:04:18.127
I used to drag myself out.

43
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.696
And by some weird twist of
fate. people actually read it.

44
00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.742
And now a studio is paying
I don't know how much money

45
00:04:24.786 --> 00:04:26.483
to put me in a freezing pool

46
00:04:26.527 --> 00:04:29.356
while girls
kick water in my face.

47
00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:31.749
It'd be a hell of a lot easier
if I could just hit you

six easy steps to life success.

Yada. yada. yada.

50
00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:40.541
But to really get into this
stuff. you've got to feel it.

51
00:04:40.584 --> 00:04:42.282
And to feel it.

52
00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:45.981
well. I guess I'm gonna have to
dig up some old painful shit.

53
00:04:46.024 --> 00:04:49.463
So. fuck it. Here it goes.

Oh. God.

59
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.006
So. I grew up
just outside of Austin. Texas.

60
00:05:14.183 --> 00:05:16.751
And I had
a very happy childhood.

61
00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:22.670
Up until I was probably. like.
ten or 11 years old.

62
00:05:22.713 --> 00:05:24.193
And around that time.

63
00:05:24.236 --> 00:05:27.414
my family life
kind of started coming apart

64
00:05:27.457 --> 00:05:30.417
and I got very rebellious.

65
00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:34.551
It was Texas.

66
00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:38.250
It was horses and Bibles
and football.

67
00:05:38.294 --> 00:05:43.386
And I wasn't
really into any of those things.

68
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.214
So. I wore
Marilyn Manson T-shirts

69
00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:49.697
and listened to heavy metal
and smoked pot and...

70
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.438
mouthed off to adults.

71
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:55.267
And that was me. you know.
That was...

72
00:05:55.311 --> 00:05:57.922
That was
the little shithead Mark.

73
00:06:00.534 --> 00:06:02.710
So. it's February 1998.

74
00:06:02.753 --> 00:06:05.974
I'm in eighth grade. and there's
a knock on the classroom door.

75
00:06:06.017 --> 00:06:07.279
And I look over

76
00:06:07.323 --> 00:06:10.108
and it's Mr. Price.
the vice principal.

77
00:06:10.152 --> 00:06:12.633
I remember he poked his head in
and he was like. "Excuse me.

78
00:06:12.676 --> 00:06:13.634
Sorry for interruption.

79
00:06:13.808 --> 00:06:15.375
Mr. Manson.
please come with me."

80
00:06:17.464 --> 00:06:19.161
So. I stepped out of class
with him.

81
00:06:19.204 --> 00:06:20.945
and I thought.
"This is weird. Like...

82
00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:23.774
Like. usually I go to him.
He doesn't come to me."

83
00:06:25.254 --> 00:06:27.299
And so I get out in the hall
with him

84
00:06:27.343 --> 00:06:30.651
and he's like.
"Take me to your locker."

85
00:06:30.694 --> 00:06:33.175
And I'm starting to freak out.
I'm like.

86
00:06:33.218 --> 00:06:36.526
"This is not normal. This is
not how things usually go."

87
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.528
Which one are we talking about?
What locker?

88
00:06:38.572 --> 00:06:40.400
S-27.

89
00:06:42.576 --> 00:06:43.838
MARK: We opened my locker.

90
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:45.927
and he just clears
the whole thing out.

91
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.537
See now.
I was a middle-school kid.

92
00:06:47.581 --> 00:06:50.453
So I had. like. all sorts of.
like. pencils and drawings

93
00:06:50.497 --> 00:06:53.195
and notes from girls in class
and stuff. you know.

94
00:06:53.238 --> 00:06:56.111
He just. like. dumps all my shit
on the floor.

95
00:06:56.154 --> 00:06:58.243
it just. like.
sprays everywhere.

96
00:06:58.287 --> 00:07:00.420
and starts
rummaging through it.

97
00:07:00.463 --> 00:07:03.031
And I'm like.
"Damn! This is serious."

98
00:07:04.772 --> 00:07:07.035
And as he's digging through
all my crap.

99
00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:09.907
there's. like.
a very awkward silence.

100
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:11.169
He looks at me and he's like.

101
00:07:11.213 --> 00:07:13.128
"Do you know
what I'm looking for today?"

102
00:07:13.171 --> 00:07:15.391
And so I just play stupid.
I'm like. "What?"

103
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:19.439
And he's like. "Drugs.
Do you have any drugs today?"

104
00:07:19.482 --> 00:07:22.354
And in my little.
like. pipsqueak voice.

105
00:07:22.398 --> 00:07:24.487
I'm like. "No. no. No. No drugs.

106
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:27.577
I-I don't know
what you're talking about."

107
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:31.102
And. uh. I can tell
he's about to let me go.

108
00:07:31.146 --> 00:07:34.366
but he's kind of looking down
on the ground at all this stuff.

109
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.414
and I don't remember if he...
if it was an accident

110
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:41.199
or if he was. like. stepping on
the backpack on purpose.

111
00:07:41.243 --> 00:07:43.680
but he steps on my backpack.

112
00:07:43.724 --> 00:07:46.988
and he feels
something's still in it.

113
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:52.341
And he's like. "What is that?"
And I was like. "What is what?"

114
00:07:52.384 --> 00:07:56.606
And the truth was that I had
cut a hole in the backpack.

115
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.042
between the pockets.

116
00:07:58.086 --> 00:07:59.522
and stuck the drugs in there

117
00:07:59.566 --> 00:08:01.785
and then kind of sewn
the bottom shut.

118
00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:02.786
but it was kind of...

119
00:08:03.178 --> 00:08:05.572
it was so you could kind
of easily get it open.

120
00:08:07.356 --> 00:08:10.272
And he found that hole
and he found the drugs.

121
00:08:10.315 --> 00:08:13.754
and he ripped it out.
and he threw 'em on the desk.

122
00:08:13.797 --> 00:08:16.583
I don't remember what he said.
but I remember the look.

123
00:08:16.626 --> 00:08:19.499
and it had the look of.
"You're fucked."

124
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:30.814
The next thing I remember.
basically. is being handcuffed.

125
00:08:30.858 --> 00:08:33.730
handcuffed
and escorted out of the school.

126
00:08:38.387 --> 00:08:41.782
And I remember the cop.
he's like. "How old are you?"

127
00:08:41.825 --> 00:08:44.436
And I said. "Thirteen."
And he was like.

128
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.570
"What on earth
made you do this?"

129
00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:59.495

I used to flirt with.

and she's like. "Oh. hey. Mark."

133
00:09:05.414 --> 00:09:07.677
And. like. smiles.
And I'm like. "Hi."

134
00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:09.810
And then she goes.
"Hi. Mr. Price."

135
00:09:09.853 --> 00:09:11.246
And then she looks over
at the cop.

136
00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:13.161
then she looks back at me.
and she's like...

like I had an exit.

"Oh. if shit gets too serious.

00:11:36.652 --> 00:11:39.394

yada. yada. yada.

173
00:11:39.437 --> 00:11:43.659
I find this attitude to be
very dangerous and damaging.

174
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.400
because the fact
of the matter is

175
00:11:45.443 --> 00:11:48.708
is that life is always going
to suck a little bit.

176
00:11:51.101 --> 00:11:53.713
And it turns out. the more
we learn and understand

177
00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:56.150
about our psychology.
the more it turns out

178
00:11:56.193 --> 00:11:59.936
that our brain is kind
of playing this game with us.

179
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.678
Generally speaking.
things in the material world

180
00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:04.288

181

You know. it's like
if you want X result.

182
00:12:07.944 --> 00:12:09.729
you need to do A. B and C
to get there.

183
00:12:09.772 --> 00:12:12.470
It's like a Lego set.
like. you find the steps.

184
00:12:12.514 --> 00:12:15.430
and then you follow the steps.
and the thing happens.

185
00:12:15.473 --> 00:12:17.519
Where that breaks down
and stops working

186
00:12:17.562 --> 00:12:20.783
is in the experiences
of our own mind.

187
00:12:22.089 --> 00:12:24.221
So. take happiness. for example.

188
00:12:24.265 --> 00:12:28.660
There's no formula for
happiness. There's no X. Y. Z.

189
00:12:28.704 --> 00:12:31.315
"Do these things every day
for three weeks

190

that way.

It's not a solvable equation.

But our mind plays
this game with us.

that as soon as you get X.

everything is gonna be great.

197
00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:53.947
Or as soon as you get rid of Y.
everything is gonna be fine.

198
00:12:54.817 --> 00:12:56.732
And we believe it.

199
00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:57.951
And it's not true.

always this little carrot

201

just get a raise at work

203

then. like. things are
gonna be fine. you know.

at work

responsibilities happen.

00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:32.289
well. damn. there are a lot
of places to go on vacation.

212

pretty much any place you pick.

turns out the weather is bad.

there's shit wherever you go.

There's always dissatisfaction.

playing this game with us.

It keeps dangling the reward
in front of us.

221
00:13:57.053 --> 00:14:00.056
convincing us that if we
can just take that next step.

222
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.971

happily ever after.

[GROWLS]

Psychologists call this
the hedonic treadmill.

225
00:14:10.675 --> 00:14:13.156
It's this idea
that we keep running

226
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.246
to accomplish something that's
gonna make us feel better.

227
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.205
But the fact of the matter is

228
00:14:18.248 --> 00:14:21.730
we're spending all this energy
yet getting nowhere.

somehow find some
magical solution

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.911
to dissolve our suffering.

00:14:28.955 --> 00:14:34.438
to dissolve our dissatisfaction
permanently. it's just bullshit.

233

Happiness is great.
but it's kind of blah.

234
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:54.241
because when you're happy.

235
00:14:54.284 --> 00:14:56.286
it means
nothing needs to change.

236
00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.509
And so I think
it's important to learn

237
00:15:01.552 --> 00:15:03.815
how to sit
with your negative emotions.

238
00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:08.995
because it's like
cross-training for your mind.

239
00:15:09.038 --> 00:15:11.606
You're always... everything
you try to do in your life.

240
00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:14.914
you're gonna bump up
against challenges. setbacks.

accidents are gonna happen.

243
00:15:18.656 --> 00:15:21.572
and so the more you're willing
to sit with those feelings.

244
00:15:21.616 --> 00:15:23.792
the more prepared
you're gonna be in the moment.

245
00:15:23.835 --> 00:15:25.925
when something goes wrong.

246
00:15:26.969 --> 00:15:29.580
And this is why I always say

247
00:15:29.624 --> 00:15:31.278
that happiness does not come

248
00:15:31.321 --> 00:15:33.497
from getting rid
of your problems.

249
00:15:33.541 --> 00:15:36.196
Happiness comes
from solving your problems.

250
00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:39.068
If at any point you believe
you don't have any problems.

251
00:15:39.112 --> 00:15:40.417
if you're ignoring your problems

252
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:43.246
or avoiding them
or escaping them in some way.

253
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.728
you're likely harming yourself
over the long run.

254
00:15:49.687 --> 00:15:51.776
And this is why
negative emotions

255
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.650
are more interesting and useful
than positive emotions.

256
00:15:58.261 --> 00:16:01.482
Because you can't always trust
your positive emotions.

257
00:16:11.622 --> 00:16:15.322

they got me out of the jail

258

and sat in that McDonald's

514
00:30:28.783 --> 00:30:30.916
that doesn't help
the bottom line.

515
00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:34.702
And I don't think the problem
is necessarily with. you know.

516
00:30:34.745 --> 00:30:36.922
capitalism or the system
or whatever.

517
00:30:36.965 --> 00:30:38.445
the problem is with us.

518
00:30:38.488 --> 00:30:42.014
Like. we just don't understand
how our own minds work.

519
00:30:42.057 --> 00:30:44.581
And so we've got to get straight
with ourselves.

520
00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:48.150
I think there's an
undue psychological pressure

521
00:30:48.194 --> 00:30:50.370
to feel as though
we're extraordinary in some way.

522
00:30:50.413 --> 00:30:52.851
that we're doing
something extraordinary.

523
00:30:52.894 --> 00:30:55.723
And I think this pushes
a sense of entitlement.

524
00:30:55.766 --> 00:30:59.379
it pushes a sense of. "Well.
I deserve to have these things.

525
00:30:59.422 --> 00:31:00.815
I deserve to be happy.

526
00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:06.865
I'm great at something.
People should know that."

527
00:31:10.303 --> 00:31:11.347
I think if there was just

528
00:31:11.391 --> 00:31:13.001
a simple cultural
acknowledgement

529
00:31:13.045 --> 00:31:16.831
of. like. "Yeah. Most of us suck
at most of the things we do.

530
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:21.314
and that's fine."
we could escape these things.

531
00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:33.761
But in my case. I covered up
my baggage and my insecurities

532
00:31:33.804 --> 00:31:36.155
with a sense of entitlement.

533
00:31:42.639 --> 00:31:45.077
And. you know.
because so much of my pain

534
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.777
revolved around intimacy
and relationships and trust.

535
00:31:51.735 --> 00:31:57.437
I just became
kind of an entitled... asshole

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.267
with a lot of relationships
in my life.

537
00:32:07.229 --> 00:32:09.144
From that pain.
and from that place

538
00:32:09.188 --> 00:32:13.018
of just not knowing
what the hell to believe.

539
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:14.933
not being able to trust anybody.
I was. like.

I remember one time. in college.
I kind of stole my buddy's girl.

553
00:34:16.228 --> 00:34:18.839
I was at
a mutual friend's place.

554
00:34:18.882 --> 00:34:21.320
and I was sitting on the couch
with her. holding hands.

555
00:34:21.363 --> 00:34:25.150

he took one look at me and her.

556
00:34:25.193 --> 00:34:27.761
and immediately turned around
and walked out of the house.

557
00:34:27.804 --> 00:34:29.589

558
00:34:32.374 --> 00:34:34.637

like. wow.

Like. this dude just. like.
he's just jealous. you know.

can't get her back or whatever.

So. I'm a huge metal fan.

573
00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.388
One of the interesting things
about heavy metal is that

574
00:35:29.431 --> 00:35:36.177
arguably the two greatest bands
were originally one band.

575
00:35:36.221 --> 00:35:38.005
...you want to say
to everybody out there?

576
00:35:38.048 --> 00:35:39.659
Metal up your ass!

577
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:42.270
MARK: Dave Mustaine

578
00:35:42.314 --> 00:35:45.099
was the original lead guitarist
of Metallica.

579
00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:46.753
And he wrote a lot of the songs

580
00:35:46.796 --> 00:35:50.539
on Metallica's first
and second records.

581
00:35:50.583 --> 00:35:54.543
The problem was that both Dave
Mustaine and James Hetfield.

582
00:35:54.587 --> 00:35:57.198
who was the lead singer
and songwriter of Metallica.

583
00:35:57.242 --> 00:35:59.592
they're both rebellious kids.

584
00:35:59.635 --> 00:36:01.246
And so they would both get drunk

585
00:36:01.289 --> 00:36:03.596
and just beat the shit
out of each other.

586
00:36:03.639 --> 00:36:07.730
And so in the midst of recording
Metallica's first album.

587
00:36:07.774 --> 00:36:09.819
Metallica just decided.
"You know what?

588
00:36:09.863 --> 00:36:11.604
Let's get rid of Dave Mustaine."

589
00:36:16.348 --> 00:36:19.699
So. they woke him up one day by
just handing him a bus ticket.

590
00:36:19.742 --> 00:36:21.701
And so mid-album.
like. the day before

591
00:36:21.744 --> 00:36:23.355
they're gonna start recording.

592
00:36:23.398 --> 00:36:25.008
Dave wakes up with a hangover.

593
00:36:25.052 --> 00:36:26.445
and they just hand
him a bus ticket

594
00:36:26.488 --> 00:36:28.011
and say. like.
"Get the fuck out."

595
00:36:28.055 --> 00:36:30.623
That's how he found out
he was out of the band.

596
00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:37.543
And so he rode this. like.
three-day bus back to L.A.

597
00:36:37.586 --> 00:36:39.022
And on the bus. you know.

598
00:36:39.066 --> 00:36:42.112
this fire started to build up
inside him.

599
00:36:42.156 --> 00:36:45.115
And by the time he got back
to California. he had decided.

600
00:36:45.159 --> 00:36:47.596
"You know what? I'm gonna
start a new metal band.

601
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.642
It's gonna be
a better metal band.

602
00:36:49.685 --> 00:36:52.427
and it's gonna fucking kick
Metallica's ass."

603
00:36:53.907 --> 00:36:55.474
And so sure enough. he got back.

604
00:36:55.517 --> 00:36:58.825
he found better musicians.
he started writing better songs.

605
00:36:58.868 --> 00:37:01.088
found better producers
to record with.

606
00:37:01.131 --> 00:37:05.092
and he produced
what became known as Megadeth.

was Metallica.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.429
an even bigger rock band
that sold even more albums.

617

"How do you know?"

he's in front of her house
with the phone.

00:40:22.245 --> 00:40:23.769

673
00:40:23.812 --> 00:40:27.294
and he's holding the phone
by his side with me on it.

674
00:40:27.337 --> 00:40:28.730
He knocks on the door.

675

and he confronts her.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.429
stumbled across a snowman
made of cocaine.

851
00:52:08.473 --> 00:52:11.998
you'd just. like. bury
your fucking head in it.

852
00:52:19.397 --> 00:52:21.877
I think socially
and emotionally.

853
00:52:21.921 --> 00:52:24.532
I felt very lost and. um...

854
00:52:24.576 --> 00:52:26.926
and I was too young
to really understand why.

855
00:52:35.369 --> 00:52:39.852
In the course of writing
all these years. I always...

856
00:52:39.895 --> 00:52:44.813
I was jealous of people who had
rules and laws named after them.

857
00:52:44.857 --> 00:52:46.772
And I was like.
"Well. I want to be a cool kid.

858
00:52:46.815 --> 00:52:48.730
so I'm gonna name a law
after myself."

859
00:52:48.774 --> 00:52:50.254
And so I created something

860
00:52:50.297 --> 00:52:52.560
called Manson's Law
of Avoidance.

861
00:52:52.604 --> 00:52:54.780
which is essentially this.

862
00:52:54.823 --> 00:52:59.306
People will avoid
an action or an experience

863
00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:00.786
in proportion to how much

864
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:03.484
it threatens their identity
and their world view.

865
00:53:03.528 --> 00:53:06.444
And the interesting thing
about Manson's Law of Avoidance

866
00:53:06.487 --> 00:53:10.970
is that it's true for both
positive and negative actions.

867
00:53:11.013 --> 00:53:14.408
And so on the positive side.
you get people self-sabotaging.

868
00:53:14.452 --> 00:53:16.323
like. "No. I don't want
to be too successful.

869
00:53:16.367 --> 00:53:18.978
I don't want to buy something
that's too nice.

870
00:53:19.021 --> 00:53:21.459
I don't want to live
somewhere too fancy.

871
00:53:21.502 --> 00:53:24.462
Like. that will... That's too
threatening for my life.

872
00:53:24.505 --> 00:53:28.335
for the security
of my life right now."

873
00:53:28.379 --> 00:53:32.513
And similarly. they avoid things
that involve a lot of risk.

874
00:53:32.557 --> 00:53:35.299
It's like. "I don't want to take
a chance in another city.

875
00:53:35.342 --> 00:53:37.910
I don't want
to break up with this person.

876
00:53:37.953 --> 00:53:42.349
It might hurt too much. it might
make things too difficult."

877
00:53:42.393 --> 00:53:46.571
Essentially what Manson's Law
says is that the...

878
00:53:46.614 --> 00:53:49.095
the resistance to change
is proportional

879
00:53:49.138 --> 00:53:52.707
to how fundamental something is
to how we see ourselves.

880
00:53:52.751 --> 00:53:54.579
and how we see the world.

881
00:53:54.622 --> 00:53:56.233
You know. in my own case.

882
00:53:56.276 --> 00:53:59.279
my relationships
were all dysfunctional.

883
00:53:59.323 --> 00:54:01.542
every single one of them.

884
00:54:01.586 --> 00:54:04.153
And part of that is just
because I thought

885
00:54:04.197 --> 00:54:06.504
dysfunctional relationships
were normal.

886
00:54:06.547 --> 00:54:09.071
that that's how
all human relationships were.

887
00:54:09.115 --> 00:54:13.293
And so I couldn't even correctly
identify the problem

888
00:54:13.337 --> 00:54:16.035
because I had constructed
a world view

889
00:54:16.078 --> 00:54:18.080
that prevented me
from seeing the problem.

890
00:54:18.124 --> 00:54:21.127
It was too fundamental
for my identity.

891
00:54:49.329 --> 00:54:53.551
In 1972. a young man
named Norio Suzuki

892
00:54:53.594 --> 00:54:56.554
first heard of the legendary
Lieutenant Onoda.

893
00:55:00.732 --> 00:55:02.647
Suzuki was an adventurer.

894
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:05.302
an explorer
and a bit of a hippy.

895
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.959
Many Japanese thought

896
00:55:11.003 --> 00:55:15.224
Lieutenant Onoda sounded
too insane to actually exist.

897
00:55:15.268 --> 00:55:17.792
Others thought
he was the stuff of fairy tales.

898
00:55:17.836 --> 00:55:20.229
invented by those
who yearned for a Japan

899
00:55:20.273 --> 00:55:22.580
that had long since disappeared.

900
00:55:24.408 --> 00:55:25.974
But for Suzuki.

901
00:55:26.018 --> 00:55:32.111
the idea of finding Onoda
was a new and worthy adventure.

902
00:55:32.154 --> 00:55:35.419
Sure. local forces
had been scavenging the jungle

903
00:55:35.462 --> 00:55:37.986
for almost 30 years
with no luck.

904
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:41.207
Thousands of leaflets
had been met with no response.

905
00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:45.298
But fuck it. this deadbeat
college dropout hippy.

906
00:55:45.342 --> 00:55:47.605
he was gonna be
the one to find him.

907
00:55:51.739 --> 00:55:53.175
Unarmed and untrained

908
00:55:53.219 --> 00:55:56.744
for any sort of reconnaissance
or tactical warfare.

909
00:55:56.788 --> 00:55:58.180
Suzuki traveled to Lubang.

910
00:55:58.224 --> 00:56:01.358
and began wandering around
the jungle by himself.

911
00:56:01.401 --> 00:56:04.186
His strategy?
Shout out Onoda's name.

912
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:07.364
and tell him that the Emperor
was worried about him.

913
00:56:14.849 --> 00:56:16.068
[GUN CLICKS]

914
00:56:17.243 --> 00:56:20.246
He found Onoda in four days.

915
00:56:25.643 --> 00:56:28.341
Now. why Onoda. after 30 years

916
00:56:28.385 --> 00:56:31.083
and millions of dollars
of rescue operations.

917
00:56:31.126 --> 00:56:35.870
decided to reveal himself to a
lowly backpacker is hard to say.

918
00:56:37.611 --> 00:56:40.222
Perhaps it was the loneliness.

919
00:56:40.266 --> 00:56:44.531
or perhaps he saw in Suzuki his
own adventurous younger self.

920
00:56:44.575 --> 00:56:47.273
a self
that was still worth saving.

921
00:56:56.674 --> 00:56:59.894
On the 9th of March. 1974.

922
00:56:59.938 --> 00:57:04.551
Hiroo Onoda was finally ordered
to terminate hostilities

923
00:57:04.595 --> 00:57:06.771
by this long-retired commander.

924
00:57:08.729 --> 00:57:11.471
He crumpled
under the weight of his pack

925
00:57:11.515 --> 00:57:15.301
and began to weep
uncontrollably.

926
00:57:22.917 --> 00:57:24.876
"Am I the chosen one?"

927
00:57:30.142 --> 00:57:32.231
We all love to believe
that we're the chosen one.

928
00:57:32.274 --> 00:57:35.277
Because we're all kind of
living out our own little story.

929
00:57:35.321 --> 00:57:37.192
our own little hero's journey.

930
00:57:37.236 --> 00:57:39.847
And so. in our own minds.
we are the chosen one.

931
00:57:41.936 --> 00:57:45.070
And it feels good.

932
00:57:45.113 --> 00:57:48.421
But this is the cheeseburger and
fries for your brain. you know.

933
00:57:48.465 --> 00:57:51.468
Like. that's... That's the junk
food for your mind.

934
00:57:51.511 --> 00:57:54.949
It tastes. like.
really good going down.

935
00:57:54.993 --> 00:57:58.431
but it makes you unhealthy
and lethargic.

936
00:58:00.346 --> 00:58:06.265
And. at some point.
this world view will fall apart.

937
00:58:06.308 --> 00:58:08.963
Like. that falling apart
has to happen.

938
00:58:35.424 --> 00:58:39.124
Something funny starts happening
as you get away from heartbreak.

939
00:58:41.648 --> 00:58:44.129
For one. you start dating
other people.

940
00:58:46.044 --> 00:58:48.089
and you start noticing patterns.

941
00:58:56.837 --> 00:58:59.361
And for me.
it was I started noticing

942
00:58:59.405 --> 00:59:03.757
that a lot of the shit that
I blamed my first girlfriend for

943
00:59:03.801 --> 00:59:07.848
was popping up with
other women I started seeing.

944
00:59:09.328 --> 00:59:11.852
And it made me
start asking myself. huh!

945
00:59:12.897 --> 00:59:15.552
Maybe it's not their fault.

946
00:59:17.379 --> 00:59:19.425
Maybe it's something I'm doing.

947
00:59:21.906 --> 00:59:25.126
And so it caused me to start
reflecting on my behavior.

948
00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:27.259
and my intentions.

949
00:59:29.435 --> 00:59:31.829
It took a number of years
for me to look back

950
00:59:31.872 --> 00:59:37.008
and realize. like.
"Wow. I was such an asshole."

951
00:59:41.839 --> 00:59:46.365
And. um. there was a lot of.
like. guilt and shame of like.

952
00:59:46.408 --> 00:59:49.455
"Wow. I can't believe
I did that.

953
00:59:49.498 --> 00:59:51.718
Like. who does that?"

954
00:59:51.762 --> 00:59:55.940
And as awful as that shame
and guilt felt. it was useful.

955
00:59:55.983 --> 00:59:58.029
Like. I needed that.

956
01:00:01.989 --> 01:00:04.513
A 58-year-old woman
has filed a civil suit

957
01:00:04.557 --> 01:00:06.994
against a local
Mexican restaurant

958
01:00:07.038 --> 01:00:08.996
after she fell off the eatery's

959
01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.259
famous plastic donkey statue.

01:00:11.303 --> 01:00:13.174
WOMAN: Two men who rushed in

961
01:00:13.218 --> 01:00:16.351
to help a woman trapped
in her SUV as it burned

962
01:00:16.395 --> 01:00:18.527
are now suing that woman.

963
01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:41.159
[CRIES]

964
01:00:41.202 --> 01:00:43.901
A lot of people
recoil from this idea

965
01:00:43.944 --> 01:00:45.554
that we're responsible
for everything

966
01:00:45.598 --> 01:00:46.817
that happens in our lives.

967
01:00:47.861 --> 01:00:50.559
But it's true. We just are.

968
01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:07.011
You hear stories
of people like this.

969
01:01:07.054 --> 01:01:09.883
All these terrible things that
have been inflicted upon them.

970

MARK: They don't want to accept

971
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:18.936
that. like. life is always going
to suck a little bit.

01:01:25.856 --> 01:01:27.379
And everybody has their shit.

973
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:30.556
But it's up to us as individuals

974
01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:32.384
not to blame others
for this stuff.

975
01:01:33.037 --> 01:01:35.430

PEGGY: Adios!

979
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:48.705
People do get offended or upset

980
01:01:48.748 --> 01:01:50.837
when you imply
that they're somehow responsible

981
01:01:50.881 --> 01:01:52.839
for a tragedy in their life.

982
01:01:52.883 --> 01:01:55.233
I mean. again.
it's not their fault.

983
01:01:55.276 --> 01:01:58.149
but it's their
responsibility.

984

You know.
you get a horrible disease.

somebody gets cancer.
a family member dies.

986
01:02:04.677 --> 01:02:07.332
Awful things do happen
in this world.

987
01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:10.422
The problem is. is that people
who fall into this mentality.

988
01:02:10.465 --> 01:02:11.989
they disempower themselves

989
01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:14.948
from actually doing anything
about their problems.

990
01:02:14.992 --> 01:02:18.517
Their goal is to simply
find new outlets to blame.

991
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.997
like new people

992
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.001
to push their responsibility
for themselves onto.

993
01:02:24.044 --> 01:02:25.176
Why is it OK for women to say.

"Oh. you're five feet?"
on dating sites.

That's OK?

-Who said that to you here?
-Nobody.

997
01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:32.749
You think
I'm making that shit up?

998
01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:35.229
Everywhere I go.
I get the same smirk.

999
01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:36.970
With the biting lip.

1000
01:02:37.014 --> 01:02:38.755
They're doing it
because they're in pain.

1001
01:02:38.798 --> 01:02:40.757
because something
really hurt them

1002
01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.280
at some point in their life.

1003
01:02:42.323 --> 01:02:43.803
And even though

1004
01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:48.808
we kind of detest their
behavior and their attitude.

1005
01:02:48.852 --> 01:02:52.203
they're still deserving
of empathy and understanding.

1006
01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:57.774
Due to our legal system.
we're accustomed

1007
01:02:57.817 --> 01:03:00.298
to equating fault
and responsibility

1008
01:03:00.341 --> 01:03:01.821
as being the same thing.

1009
01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:03.040
but they're not.

WOMAN:
Jennifer Connell sued the boy

1011
01:03:04.606 --> 01:03:05.912
over an injury she received

during his eighth
birthday party.

1013
01:03:07.914 --> 01:03:10.917
when he leaped
into her arms to hug her.

1014
01:03:10.961 --> 01:03:13.093
We're not always at fault
for our pain.

1015
01:03:13.137 --> 01:03:15.443
but we are always responsible
for our pain.

1016
01:03:15.487 --> 01:03:17.837
We are always interpreting
our pain.

1017
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:20.448
We are always reacting
to our pain.

1018
01:03:23.712 --> 01:03:28.761
While it's not my fault when
my first girlfriend dumped me.

1019
01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:33.287
I shared responsibility in
the failure of the relationship.

1047
01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:30.187

is essentially admitting

he was confronted

The Japan he had been
fighting for no longer existed.

Thirty years of life wasted.

1063
01:06:44.565 --> 01:06:50.528
Hiroo Onoda's is a precautionary

ended. the Empire collapsed.

1067

and the modern world completely
changed. he never left the past.

1068
01:07:04.411 --> 01:07:08.720
Every event that occurred.
he simply reinterpreted it

1069
01:07:08.763 --> 01:07:10.809
to fit his prior world view.

1070
01:07:17.076 --> 01:07:18.773
I think most people tend
to see the world

1071
01:07:18.817 --> 01:07:22.255
in terms of right and wrong.
Who's right. who's wrong.

1072
01:07:22.299 --> 01:07:24.736
and there's kind of
no middle ground.

1073
01:07:24.779 --> 01:07:26.346
I prefer to think of it

1074
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:29.828
in terms of everybody
is wrong all the time.

1075
01:07:29.871 --> 01:07:33.527
And it's just a question
of who's slightly less wrong.

1076
01:07:33.571 --> 01:07:35.051
And I don't think

1077
01:07:35.094 --> 01:07:37.531
we ask that critical question
of ourselves very often.

1078
01:07:37.575 --> 01:07:39.446
because it's not just true
of society.

1079
01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:41.274
it's also true of us
as individuals.

1080
01:07:41.318 --> 01:07:45.409
Things that I was certain
were true ten. 20 years ago.

1081
01:07:45.452 --> 01:07:47.324
now I look back at
and I laugh at.

1082
01:07:52.198 --> 01:07:54.026
I was certain
that my relationship

1083
01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:56.159
with my first girlfriend
was perfect.

1084
01:07:56.202 --> 01:07:59.031
and we were in love. and
everything was gonna be great.

1085
01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:02.426
I was completely wrong
about that.

1086
01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:05.733
So instead of constantly
looking for certainty.

1087
01:08:05.777 --> 01:08:08.214
it's more effective
to look for doubt.

1088
01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:14.655

be wrong about?

could be improved upon?

the more effective questions.

One of my favorite psychologists
and researchers

1106
01:09:10.058 --> 01:09:12.583
is a guy
named Kazimierz Dabrowski.

1107
01:09:14.454 --> 01:09:16.543
He was from Poland
during the Cold War.

1108
01:09:16.587 --> 01:09:18.589
so he was
behind the Iron Curtain.

And it's really interesting

1110
01:09:21.505 --> 01:09:23.289
because if you look
at the psychological research

1111
01:09:23.333 --> 01:09:25.639
that was happening
during the 20th century...

1112
01:09:28.338 --> 01:09:32.168
in the West. it was
very much focused on positivity.

1113
01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:34.431
How do we
make people feel better?

1114
01:09:35.997 --> 01:09:38.435
How do we improve
people's self-esteem?

1115
01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:42.439
How do we make people happier?

1116
01:09:44.528 --> 01:09:49.359
Whereas in the East. it was much
more about negative experience.

1117
01:09:49.402 --> 01:09:52.797
It was about how does pain
and suffering affect people?

1118
01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:57.976
How does trauma shape them
or change them in various ways?

1119
01:10:02.241 --> 01:10:05.418
And Dabrowski. by being
a researcher in Warsaw.

1120
01:10:05.462 --> 01:10:08.421
he had access
to World War Two survivors

1121
01:10:08.465 --> 01:10:12.512
and Holocaust survivors
to study.

1122
01:10:12.556 --> 01:10:15.428
And so he ended up
interviewing hundreds of them.

1123
01:10:15.472 --> 01:10:17.604
And he found something
incredibly startling.

1124
01:10:22.783 --> 01:10:24.742
The majority of people

1125
01:10:24.785 --> 01:10:28.136
who survived the war
and survived the Holocaust

1126
01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:32.924
eventually attributed those
experiences as benefitting them.

1127
01:10:36.754 --> 01:10:40.497
They basically said that
those experiences.

1128
01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:42.325
as awful as they were.

1129
01:10:42.368 --> 01:10:44.283
made them better people.

1130
01:10:48.113 --> 01:10:51.682
It made them more grateful.
it made the more compassionate.

1131
01:10:53.988 --> 01:10:56.817
It improved
their sense of self-respect.

1132
01:11:00.778 --> 01:11:04.303

a very uncomfortable thought.

it's always gonna have struggle.

1191
01:14:26.331 --> 01:14:27.593
But if you can train yourself

1192
01:14:27.637 --> 01:14:29.508
to not give a fuck
about the pain...

1193
01:14:31.728 --> 01:14:33.730
you become unstoppable.

1194
01:14:35.732 --> 01:14:38.125
The emotional difficulty
of change

1195
01:14:38.169 --> 01:14:41.564
is always directly proportional
to the scale of change.

1196
01:14:41.607 --> 01:14:45.176
or to how core it is
to your identity.

1197
01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:49.528
It's not fun.
It's not fun at all.

1199
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.501
MARK: So. if I could create
a superhero.

1200
01:15:05.544 --> 01:15:07.807
I would create
Disappointment Panda.

1201
01:15:09.548 --> 01:15:12.856
Have you ever seen those viral
Egyptian cheese commercials?

1202
01:15:12.899 --> 01:15:15.032
Disappointment Panda
is kind of like that.

1203
01:15:15.075 --> 01:15:19.340
[IN ARABIC]

1204
01:15:19.384 --> 01:15:21.429
MARK: But instead
of making people eat cheese.

1205
01:15:21.473 --> 01:15:23.823
you'd be making them eat
harsh truths about themselves.

1206
01:15:23.867 --> 01:15:25.521
that nobody wanted to hear.

1207
01:15:28.872 --> 01:15:30.264
You know. he'd say.

1208
01:15:30.308 --> 01:15:32.223
"Making a lot of money
might make you feel good.

1209
01:15:32.266 --> 01:15:34.965
but it won't make your kids
love you."

1210
01:15:35.008 --> 01:15:37.358
Or he'd say.
"You're not really sick.

1211
01:15:37.402 --> 01:15:40.797
you're just avoiding the pain
of having driven your wife away

1212
01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.407
by your constant complaining."

1213
01:15:43.364 --> 01:15:45.323
And then if you didn't listen...

1214
01:15:45.366 --> 01:15:46.890
[CRASH]

1215
01:15:46.933 --> 01:15:49.980
Well. he'd have ways
of making you listen.

1216
01:15:52.852 --> 01:15:56.813
The fact is that we need
to eat our problem cheese.

1217
01:15:56.856 --> 01:15:59.337
If we're not willing to face
and admit our problems.

1218
01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:02.558
then we can't change
and we can't grow.

1219
01:16:10.261 --> 01:16:11.654
Disappointment Panda is the hero

1220
01:16:11.697 --> 01:16:15.005
that none of us want.
but we all actually need.

1221
01:16:15.048 --> 01:16:18.095
Because we all have truths in
our lives that we avoid hearing.

1222
01:16:18.138 --> 01:16:19.662
that we don't want to confront

1223
01:16:19.705 --> 01:16:21.707
or don't want to admit
to ourselves.

1224
01:16:21.751 --> 01:16:24.057
Yet. it's by confronting
or admitting them

1225
01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:27.583
that we can actually
open the way to become better.

1226
01:16:34.024 --> 01:16:35.939
A lot of people
don't like hearing this.

1227
01:16:35.982 --> 01:16:39.290
Like. we like to hear that our
problems can be solved forever.

1228
01:16:39.333 --> 01:16:44.382
we like to hear that there's
some formula to be happy.

1229
01:16:44.425 --> 01:16:46.427
live happily ever after.

1230
01:16:46.471 --> 01:16:50.388
But I'm sorry.
but Disappointment Panda says.

1231
01:16:50.431 --> 01:16:54.305
"No. there's not.
This is simply how life is."

1232
01:16:54.348 --> 01:16:57.090
And so if we're forced
to have problems.

1233
01:16:57.134 --> 01:16:59.353
then we might as well
find the problems

1234
01:16:59.397 --> 01:17:00.964
that we enjoy having in life.

1235
01:17:01.007 --> 01:17:03.183
You know. when everybody
hears this idea

1236
01:17:03.227 --> 01:17:04.881
of. like. not giving a fuck.

1237
01:17:04.924 --> 01:17:08.406
you kind of imagine this. like.
cool dude kicking back. like.

1238
01:17:08.449 --> 01:17:10.277
"Yeah. Fuck it. man.
Like. whatever."

1239
01:17:10.321 --> 01:17:13.716
Like a beach bum or something.
and it's...

1240
01:17:13.759 --> 01:17:16.153
That's not what it is.

1241
01:17:16.196 --> 01:17:18.285
You know. you have to give
a fuck about something.

1242
01:17:18.329 --> 01:17:20.505
You have to care about something
in your life.

1243
01:17:20.548 --> 01:17:23.290
The question is. what are you
choosing to care about?

1244
01:17:23.334 --> 01:17:25.553
Because when you choose
your problems in your life.

1245
01:17:25.597 --> 01:17:29.427
when you find problems
that you like having.

1246
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:33.605
that's when you suddenly
find yourself not giving a fuck.

1247
01:17:40.133 --> 01:17:41.265
When you don't give a fuck

1248
01:17:41.613 --> 01:17:44.442
that you're making these
sacrifices for your family.

1249
01:17:49.316 --> 01:17:50.753
When you don't give a fuck

1250
01:17:50.796 --> 01:17:53.059
that it's hard to practice
for another hour.

1251
01:17:54.017 --> 01:17:55.409
When you don't give a fuck

1252
01:17:55.453 --> 01:17:58.021
that you have to get up
early in the morning

1253
01:17:58.064 --> 01:18:00.327
and put in more time at work.

1254
01:18:01.067 --> 01:18:05.289
When you've found the struggle
that enlivens and enriches you.

1255
01:18:05.332 --> 01:18:10.120
that's when you've achieved
non-fuck-giving mastery.

1256
01:18:13.079 --> 01:18:14.994
There's one thing
I started to realize

1257
01:18:15.038 --> 01:18:17.780
after traveling quite a bit
is that at some point.

1258
01:18:17.823 --> 01:18:21.261
there's diminishing returns
to new experiences.

1259
01:18:25.048 --> 01:18:27.964
In that moment. like.
that's a terrifying thought.

1260
01:18:28.007 --> 01:18:30.314
It's a really terrifying
thought.

1261
01:18:32.142 --> 01:18:34.361
But what you discover
is that there's actually

1262
01:18:34.405 --> 01:18:37.625
a newer. more subtle kind
of freedom in that commitment.

1263
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:41.281
I eventually was forced
to face my commitment issues.

1264
01:18:41.325 --> 01:18:43.849
for the simple fact that there
was nowhere else left to run.

1265
01:18:43.893 --> 01:18:47.026
I had literally
run around the world...

1266
01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:50.813
escaping any sense of commitment
to a person or a place.

1267
01:18:52.162 --> 01:18:54.773
So. when you run out
of places to run.

1268
01:18:54.817 --> 01:18:57.341
it's like. "Well. shit.
I've got to pick something."

1269
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:06.480
When I was 19 years old.

1270
01:19:06.524 --> 01:19:11.747
I went through probably the most
transformational experience

1271
01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:12.748
of my life.

1272
01:19:17.448 --> 01:19:19.711
Josh. I met him at music school.

1273
01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:21.365
He was actually
kind of the first friend

1274
01:19:21.408 --> 01:19:22.366
I made at music school.

1275
01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:25.108
He lived across the hall
in the dorm from me.

1276
01:19:27.588 --> 01:19:30.896
He was kind of like
an older-brother figure for me.

1277
01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:32.376
Very extroverted.

1278
01:19:33.072 --> 01:19:35.858
bigger-than-life energy.
you know.

1279
01:19:35.901 --> 01:19:37.816
He was a natural performer.

1280
01:19:44.736 --> 01:19:47.521
Like. at music school.
it's a very strange dynamic

1281
01:19:47.565 --> 01:19:50.437
because there are a lot of
status games that are going...

1282
01:19:50.481 --> 01:19:51.961
People are very competitive.

1283
01:19:52.004 --> 01:19:55.878
"Oh. this band
is more obscure and technical

1284
01:19:55.921 --> 01:19:57.488
than the band you're into."

1285
01:19:57.531 --> 01:20:01.884
"I prefer late-period Brahms
versus early-period Brahms."

1286
01:20:01.927 --> 01:20:05.713
And. you know. all this kind of
pretentious stuff that happens.

1287
01:20:05.757 --> 01:20:07.715
And I'm hanging out
in my dorm room.

1288
01:20:07.759 --> 01:20:09.195
and all of a sudden.

1289
01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:11.241
the guy across the hall.
like. blasts "Billie Jean".

1290
01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:13.721
Like. full blast.

1291
01:20:14.244 --> 01:20:16.289
It kind of makes a statement.

1292
01:20:16.333 --> 01:20:18.726
It kind of says.
"I don't give a fuck."

1293
01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:22.252
Like.
"Fuck your pretentious music."

1294
01:20:22.295 --> 01:20:26.778
He was just this big.
boisterous. fun-loving guy

1295
01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:29.128
who just wanted to sing
and play drums

1296
01:20:29.172 --> 01:20:30.260
and. like. have a good time

1297
01:20:30.913 --> 01:20:35.134
and just didn't buy into
all the bullshit.

1298
01:20:35.178 --> 01:20:38.529
To me. it was just magnetic
to hang around him.

1299
01:20:42.011 --> 01:20:46.276
He was much more confident
than I was.

1300
01:20:47.103 --> 01:20:49.061
Kind of a role model.

1301
01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:58.288
There was a place. maybe
45 minutes outside of Dallas.

1302
01:20:58.331 --> 01:20:59.942
out kind of near this lake.

1303
01:20:59.985 --> 01:21:02.640
And. um. Josh. like. he told me.

1304
01:21:02.683 --> 01:21:06.470
"Dude. they just have these
crazy parties every weekend."

1305
01:21:06.513 --> 01:21:08.037
And there was this...

1306
01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.604
there was a cliff kind
of like overlooking this lake.

1307
01:21:10.648 --> 01:21:14.173
and people would jump off
that cliff into the water.

1308
01:21:14.695 --> 01:21:16.219
So. we go to this party.

1309
01:21:16.959 --> 01:21:19.004
And then I asked him
if he did it.

1310
01:21:19.048 --> 01:21:21.485
And he was like. "Oh. yeah.
yeah. I've done it before."

1311
01:21:21.528 --> 01:21:22.703
I was like. "Oh. cool."

1312
01:21:23.313 --> 01:21:24.923
Then he asked me
if I wanted to do it.

1313
01:21:24.967 --> 01:21:28.187
and I was like.
"Uh... I might watch you first."

1314
01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:30.668
You know. like.
that sort of thing.

1315
01:21:31.843 --> 01:21:34.193
And at some point
during the party.

1316
01:21:34.237 --> 01:21:35.978
I met a girl
and kind of got into her

1317
01:21:36.021 --> 01:21:38.328
and we got separated.

1318
01:21:39.024 --> 01:21:40.852
And the last time
I ever saw Josh.

1319
01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:44.421
I was walking up towards
the house with the girl

1320
01:21:44.464 --> 01:21:46.118
and he was coming down.

1321
01:21:46.162 --> 01:21:48.773
And I said. "Hey. I'm gonna go
get some food. Do you want some?

1322
01:21:48.816 --> 01:21:50.993
He was like. "No. man. I'm good.
I'll catch you later."

1323
01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:54.779
And so. when I said.
"Hey. where can I find you?".

1324
01:21:54.822 --> 01:21:57.695
he was like.
"Seek the truth for yourself.

1325
01:21:57.738 --> 01:21:59.349
and I'll meet you there."

1326
01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.440
I just. like. laughed and. like.
"All right. dude. whatever.

1327
01:22:03.483 --> 01:22:05.007
I'll see you at the truth."

1328
01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:07.923
You know. as if we all know
where the truth is.

1329
01:22:07.966 --> 01:22:11.883
And so then.
I went up to the house.

1330
01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:15.408
and then when we came out.
everybody was gone.

1331
01:22:19.717 --> 01:22:22.459
And so it's. like.
this weird. surreal.

1332
01:22:22.502 --> 01:22:25.549
like. "What the fuck?"
type moment.

1333
01:22:25.592 --> 01:22:27.812
And so we walked down
to the water.

1334
01:22:27.855 --> 01:22:30.728
and I started looking for Josh
and I can't find him.

1335
01:22:31.816 --> 01:22:35.863
There's. like. ambulances
and police cars and stuff

1336
01:22:35.907 --> 01:22:37.561
with the lights going.

1337
01:22:37.604 --> 01:22:41.957
and there were a couple of guys
in the water. swimming around.

1338
01:22:43.393 --> 01:22:45.395
And then I remember I walked up

1339
01:22:46.178 --> 01:22:49.486
to. uh. this guy and this girl.
and I asked them.

1340
01:22:49.529 --> 01:22:52.358
I'd seen them talking to
Josh earlier. and I asked them.

1341
01:22:53.794 --> 01:22:56.710
And the girl just starts crying.
like. just bawl...

1342
01:22:56.754 --> 01:22:58.930
As soon as I asked her.
she just starts bawling.

1343
01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:01.977
And then at that point.
I'm like. "Oh. my God.

1344
01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:05.154
It's him. Like. he's the one
who went down."

1345
01:23:06.459 --> 01:23:08.287
And I must have walked
around the water

1346
01:23:08.331 --> 01:23:11.464
for like an hour. I guess.

1347
01:23:11.943 --> 01:23:17.514
And... it just starts dawning
on me. like. he's not here.

1348
01:23:30.744 --> 01:23:34.270
I remember a police officer
came up to me

1349
01:23:35.706 --> 01:23:39.014
and asked me if I knew him
and I said. "Yeah."

1350
01:23:41.799 --> 01:23:44.236
I don't remember what she asked.
I don't remember...

1351
01:23:44.976 --> 01:23:46.412
I think she gave up.

1352
01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:52.592
I got in my car and I started
driving back to Austin.

1353
01:23:52.636 --> 01:23:53.941
And so I called my dad.

1354
01:23:53.985 --> 01:23:56.292
I was working for my dad
that summer.

1355
01:23:56.335 --> 01:23:58.990

"Hey. I'm not gonna make it

01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:18.749

1361
01:24:19.793 --> 01:24:22.318
crying to his father.

1362
01:24:22.361 --> 01:24:24.363
You know when
you're a little. little kid.

1363
01:24:24.407 --> 01:24:25.582
and you just grab your parent.

1364
01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:29.020
and just cry everything out
into them.

1365
01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.413
Like. it was like that.

1366
01:24:39.248 --> 01:24:43.208

in my life. but that was...

just a pure... nothingness.

01:24:56.221 --> 01:24:58.180
I used to have dreams of him.

1370
01:24:59.529 --> 01:25:01.270
I remember I had this one dream

1371
01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:04.708
where he and I were sitting
in a Jacuzzi together.

1372
01:25:06.579 --> 01:25:08.581
And I remember telling him.

1373

"Hey. man.
I'm really sorry you died."

1374
01:25:14.892 --> 01:25:18.374
He was like... he's like.
"Why do you care that I'm dead.

when you're still so afraid
to live?"

1376
01:25:26.947 --> 01:25:28.471

01:25:28.514 --> 01:25:32.301
just. like. a fucking mess.
total mess.

1378
01:25:33.302 --> 01:25:35.913
But I had this very powerful
realization that.

01:25:36.696 --> 01:25:38.437
if there's no reason
to do anything.

1380
01:25:38.481 --> 01:25:41.571
there's also no reason
to not do anything.

1381
01:25:42.746 --> 01:25:44.443
Like. there's no reason
to be ashamed.

1382
01:25:44.487 --> 01:25:46.706
there's no reason to be afraid.

1383
01:25:47.968 --> 01:25:51.015
And so that fall. I really...

1384
01:25:51.668 --> 01:25:53.452
it really changed me a lot.

I thought I didn't give a fuck.

01:26:10.513 --> 01:26:13.559
but it's like I actually gave
way too many fucks.

1391
01:26:13.603 --> 01:26:15.692
And that's why I was scared
to really do anything.

1392
01:26:15.735 --> 01:26:20.740

it was a wake-up call of like.

01:27:06.046 --> 01:27:09.963
I think he kind of saw
that I needed to be pushed.

01:27:11.878 --> 01:27:14.359
And he was that friend
who pushed me.

removes all that.
