00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:52.880
- Quickly. Mike!

4
00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:16.069
- Quick. come on!

5
00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:19.773
- Fuck!

6
00:02:19.807 --> 00:02:21.008
Oh. we need to find a way out!

7
00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:21.842
- Where?

8
00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:28.115
- Quick. quick. quick!

9
00:03:15.763 --> 00:03:16.564
- Run!

10
00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:29.710
- I can't.

11
00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:33.847
I can't. I can't keep running.

12
00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:40.153
Do we even know
where we're going?

13
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.024
- We're so close. we just.

14
00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:47.361
we just. we've just
got to keep moving.

15
00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:48.896
- How can you be sure?

16
00:03:50.598 --> 00:03:53.200
It's been days since
we've seen daylight.

17
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.167
How can you know?

18
00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:56.136
- I just do. Keeley. okay?

19
00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:02.410
We've got to get out of here
before it realizes we've gone.

20
00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:05.112
- They're all gone.

21
00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:07.214
What do we do?

22
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.521
- Okay.

23
00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:15.756
We get out of here
and we survive.

24
00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:16.757
For them.

25
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.292
Do you understand?

26
00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.195
- Whatever that thing was.

27
00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:23.531
it wasn't human.

28
00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:26.600
- We've got to keep going.

29
00:04:26.634 --> 00:04:27.668
Please.

30
00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:28.869
Okay?

31
00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:33.907
Come on!

32
00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:48.456
He's here!

33
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:49.289
Come on!

34
00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:56.764
Wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait.

35
00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:59.132
He's here. he's close.

36
00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:02.436
- Mike.
- Wait. no!

37
00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:03.804
Listen to me. okay?

38
00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:04.838
Listen to me.

39
00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:08.709
We need to go into the church.

40
00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:09.843
and we need to hide out
until someone comes.

41
00:05:09.843 --> 00:05:10.911
- No. we need to get out.

42
00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:12.546
No. we need to get out of here!

43
00:05:12.613 --> 00:05:13.814
- Shh. shh!

44
00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:16.450
Quiet. you're going
to get us killed!

45
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.250
- No. no.

46
00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:25.158
Come on. come on!

47
00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.096
- Just go!

48
00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:30.130
Go. just run!

49
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:32.232
Go!

50
00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:33.200
Run!

51
00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:43.276
No.

52
00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.628
- What are you doing?

53
00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:01.695
No!

54
00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:02.563
Let me in!

55
00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:03.363
Please!

56
00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:04.197
No!

57
00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:08.736
- Told you not to
go into those woods!

58
00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:09.770
I told you!

59
00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:12.440
- Please!

60
00:06:12.473 --> 00:06:13.273
No!

61
00:06:17.277 --> 00:06:18.278
Let me in!

62
00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:19.079
No!

63
00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:31.925
No!

64
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.033
- Forgive me. Lord. for
I must protect myself.

65
00:06:55.683 --> 00:06:58.085
- Casey. are you
sure it's in here?

66
00:06:58.085 --> 00:06:59.920
- I swear that's where
I put the suncream.

67
00:06:59.953 --> 00:07:02.756
- Well. if not you can
always borrow some of mine.

68
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:03.991
- I'm just thinking though.

69
00:07:04.024 --> 00:07:05.425
surely between us
it's only going

70
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.894
to last a day or two.

71
00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:09.630
and I don't want to look like
a lobster for my wedding!

72
00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:11.364
- True.

73
00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:14.935
well. I definitely can't see it.

74
00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:16.570
- Don't worry about
it. I'll figure it out.

75
00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:19.439
Do you think I need to
pack any more shorts?

76
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.041
- How many have you got?

77
00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:21.875
- Three pairs?

78
00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:25.445
- We're only going
for a few days!

79
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.847
You could probably get away

80
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.916
with the ones you're
wearing and pack a spare.

81
00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.118
- Aw. I always over-pack!

82
00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:34.555
- Well. don't worry.
'cause I always under-pack

83
00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:36.356
and I get to pinch
your stuff. so.

84
00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:37.725
feel free to pack whatever.

85
00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:41.361
- Hey.

86
00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:44.865
I wanna ask you something.

87
00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:47.935
* I just wanna get you married

88
00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:52.906
* Wanna get you married

89
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:56.009
* - Why does this feel weird?

90
00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:57.811
- It's not weird.

91
00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.313
I wanted to ask you and.

92
00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:03.851
I know I said I was going
to keep it low-key. but.

93
00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:05.452
I was just wondering if.

94
00:08:07.921 --> 00:08:08.922
potentially.

95
00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:12.726
you would be my bridesmaid?

96
00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:15.696
- Oh my God!

97
00:08:16.964 --> 00:08:19.733
Wow. I was starting to
think you'd never ask!

98
00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:22.135
- I just need to run a
few things past Tim. so...

99
00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:27.407
- Run past. who you asked
to be your bridesmaid?

100
00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:29.209
Wow. that's not controlling.

101
00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:33.146
- What's your issue
with him. Ava?

102
00:08:34.548 --> 00:08:36.416
- It's fine. no. it's.

103
00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:41.488
you know. if. if
he loves you and.

104
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.958
he's 100% the person
you want to be with.

105
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:45.759
then amazing!

106
00:08:45.793 --> 00:08:46.594
Go for it.

107
00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:51.965
Only you know what you want
for you and your future.

108
00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:53.867
- It's just.

109
00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:57.805
when you put it like that.
it just sounds so. like...

110
00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:03.043
- Well. this should
be exciting. okay?

111
00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.878
And your best friend
shouldn't be making you feel

112
00:09:04.912 --> 00:09:06.313
any other way.

113
00:09:06.313 --> 00:09:09.016
So fuck me and my opinion!

114
00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:09.883
And you do you.

115
00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:13.486
I just want you to be happy.

116
00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:19.326
I love you.

117
00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:20.227
- I love you too.

118
00:09:21.428 --> 00:09:23.764
- Sorry for being such a bitch.

119
00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:43.083
- Girls. I think
she's gonna love this.

120
00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.918
It's just so thoughtful.

121
00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:46.887
- Aw. thank you Mrs. Drake.

122
00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:48.321
- It's so nice you
girls have kept

123
00:09:48.355 --> 00:09:50.891
such a tight group since school.

124
00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.927
- Yeah. but some
things never change.

125
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:54.762
Late.

126
00:09:54.762 --> 00:09:55.729
As usual.

127
00:09:55.763 --> 00:09:57.197
- Yara. you know my daughter.

128
00:09:57.197 --> 00:09:59.667
She'll be late to her
own wedding. most likely.

129
00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:02.636
- Speaking of the devil.

130
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:05.673
Right. okay. ladies!

131
00:10:05.673 --> 00:10:06.874
We need to hit the road.

132
00:10:06.907 --> 00:10:08.709
Got a three-hour
drive ahead of us.

133
00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:10.377
- Don't look at me. I
tried to get her moving.

134
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.611
- I'm sorry!

135
00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:13.013
I don't go camping. I
don't know what to pack!

136
00:10:13.013 --> 00:10:14.214
- What do you mean?

137
00:10:14.247 --> 00:10:16.249
All you need is a
T-shirt and shorts!

138
00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:17.484
- Maybe that's all you need.

139
00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:18.886
but some of us need
a change of clothes.

140
00:10:19.753 --> 00:10:21.121
Hey!

141
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.555
Mom!
- Surprise!

142
00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:26.093
- What a great surprise!

143
00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:28.195
- She had to come.

144
00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:29.396
Plus. she said
she'd cook for us.

145
00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:30.998
So why the hell not?

146
00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:32.232
- I can double up. you see?

147
00:10:32.265 --> 00:10:33.266
- Sounds great. mum.

148
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:37.204
- Oh. you gotta put this on.

149
00:10:37.237 --> 00:10:39.406
- Oh God. really?

150
00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:40.674
- Yes. and this.

151
00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:45.012
- Ooh. a veil!

152
00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:46.413
Thank you!

153
00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:48.849
- Does that feel all right?
- Yeah. I'm in!

154
00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:51.184
- Right. girls. Tour Guide Yara

155
00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:53.386
says it's time for the
first obligatory selfie.

156
00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:55.789
- Yes. selfie!
- Right. everyone get in.

157
00:10:55.789 --> 00:10:56.589
- We ready?

158
00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:57.424
Everyone get in.

159
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.291
- Yeah. I'm ready!

160
00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:01.328
- Ready. three. two. one.

161
00:11:56.884 --> 00:11:58.651
- Oh. isn't this lovely?

162
00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:01.654
- Yeah. of course it is. mum.

163
00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:07.427
- Do you mind if I
stretch for a bit?

164
00:12:07.494 --> 00:12:08.361
- Oh. sure.

165
00:12:10.864 --> 00:12:12.833
Why don't we all
grab some water?

166
00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:14.234
I think we're gonna need it.

167
00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:15.035
- Sure.

168
00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:18.671
Are you
excited for the big day?

169
00:12:20.007 --> 00:12:21.241
- A mix of feelings.

170
00:12:21.274 --> 00:12:23.043
Yeah. of course I am. just.

171
00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:29.049
I'm in my mid-20s and I'm
making a huge commitment.

172
00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:30.884
- Everyone has those worries.

173
00:12:30.884 --> 00:12:32.285
I mean. a marriage
isn't something you can

174
00:12:32.285 --> 00:12:33.486
just wake up someday and say.

175
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.988
I don't want to
do this any more.

176
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.231
- Hey.

177
00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:45.365
How's baby doing?

178
00:12:46.934 --> 00:12:48.135
- Yeah.

179
00:12:48.168 --> 00:12:49.136
Bit of an adventure
for both of us.

180
00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:00.280
Have you told her ye?

181
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.815
- Lizzie. not now.

182
00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:03.683
- She's getting married to him.

183
00:13:03.683 --> 00:13:07.254
If you don't tell her
now. when will you?

184
00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.389
You do
love him. don't you?

185
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:10.790
Tim?

186
00:13:10.824 --> 00:13:12.225
- Of course I do.

187
00:13:12.225 --> 00:13:13.827
- Well. that's all
that matters. then.

188
00:13:13.827 --> 00:13:15.562
It's be fine.

189
00:13:15.562 --> 00:13:17.030
All right. ladies!

190
00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:17.931
Can we get going?

191
00:13:19.332 --> 00:13:20.567
- Yes. Tour Guide Yara.

192
00:13:22.402 --> 00:13:23.536
- I'll take that.

193
00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:24.304
- Mm?

194
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.112
- That's not on the map.

195
00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.950
- I would say that's not south.

196
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.319
No. I think
it is south. because
if you look there-

197
00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.753
This is not south.

198
00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:42.956
No. it is
south. 'cause look.

199
00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:45.158
- Wait. let me have a look.

200
00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:03.210
- No one's in there.

201
00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:05.445
- You know. I'd have
loved to get married

202
00:14:05.445 --> 00:14:06.446
somewhere like this.

203
00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:11.518
- I know. you always talked
about that fairytale wedding.

204
00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.353
- I know. it'd be
perfect. right?

205
00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:21.628
- Someone there?

206
00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:29.769
- Can't see anything.

207
00:14:35.242 --> 00:14:36.209
'Scuse me.

208
00:14:37.844 --> 00:14:40.313
- Oh. um. sorry. we. um.

209
00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:42.515
we didn't know this
was a working church.

210
00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:43.516
- It's not.

211
00:14:43.516 --> 00:14:44.952
Not anymore.

212
00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:47.454
I just stick around here.
look after the place.

213
00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:51.491
- Cool. We'll be going. then.

214
00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:53.760
- What are you doing
around this area?

215
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.362
- Sorry?

216
00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:58.398
- The path to the north. it's
out of bounds to the public.

217
00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:01.168
- Oh. um. is it?

218
00:15:02.335 --> 00:15:03.436
No. I used to come
here as a kid.

219
00:15:03.436 --> 00:15:04.837
I think it's fine.

220
00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:06.806
- Not to the north.

221
00:15:06.806 --> 00:15:07.707
It's out of bounds.

222
00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:09.409
Has been for a long time.

223
00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:11.311
You must be thinking
of further south.

224
00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.282
- Well. we won't trespass
anywhere that's private.

225
00:15:15.282 --> 00:15:18.251
- It's not about it
being private land. girl.

226
00:15:18.285 --> 00:15:19.953
It's about what you'll
find in those woods.

227
00:15:19.953 --> 00:15:23.356
Those woods are a maze.
and if you get lost.

228
00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:24.724
Hell knows what lurks.

229
00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:27.427
- Sure thing.

230
00:15:28.695 --> 00:15:30.730
- Okay. have a nice day.

231
00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:35.235
- I'm warning you now.
don't go any further north.

232
00:15:38.171 --> 00:15:41.374
If you do come across it.
the organ will hold it off.

233
00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:57.590
- Lovely.
- Ooh. can I see?

234
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.991
Yeah. yeah.

235
00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:01.228
- Oh. that's so good.

236
00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.030
- Oh. I look like an elephant!

237
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.632
No. you'll
really treasure it.

238
00:16:05.665 --> 00:16:06.866
What's with that face?

239
00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:08.001
- Oh. this priest
wasn't too happy

240
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:09.602
about us hiking in this area.

241
00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.638
- Uh. more like we need to
get the hell out of here

242
00:16:11.671 --> 00:16:13.706
before Leatherface
comes and hacks us up.

243
00:16:14.607 --> 00:16:16.443
- Okay. let's get going.

244
00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:19.746
- Yep. which way?
- That way.

245
00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.214
- Great. come on.
- Come on.

246
00:16:31.224 --> 00:16:32.892
- They never listen.

247
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.596
- You girls forgotten how
to put a tent up or what?

248
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.832
- It's been a while. okay?

249
00:17:45.832 --> 00:17:47.634
- I'm excused. I'm pregnant.

250
00:17:49.035 --> 00:17:51.037
- You know. I think I
agree with what that guy.

251
00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:52.272
the priest. said.

252
00:17:52.305 --> 00:17:54.174
I don't think this is
where we used to camp.

253
00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:56.109
- Okay. we might've got
a little bit lost. but.

254
00:17:56.109 --> 00:17:57.610
I still think it's really
beautiful around here.

255
00:17:57.644 --> 00:18:00.046
- Yeah. yeah. no. I'm not
saying that. it's just.

256
00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:02.215
definitely could've gone
in a different direction.

257
00:18:03.616 --> 00:18:06.386
- Do you think there's anything
else we have to be wary of?

258
00:18:06.386 --> 00:18:08.188
- Like what?

259
00:18:08.188 --> 00:18:11.791
- I don't know. like. bears
or snakes. or something.

260
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:13.693
- Somehow. I think
we'll be all right.

261
00:18:15.528 --> 00:18:16.763
You know. I think
these tents are going

262
00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:18.531
to be a bit smaller
than what I thought.

263
00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:20.833
I still think they'll
fit three of us. though.

264
00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:24.204
- Can someone help me get
some logs for the fire?

265
00:18:24.204 --> 00:18:25.805
Gonna need to get it
going pretty quick

266
00:18:25.805 --> 00:18:28.107
if we're going to whip
up some food before dark.

267
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.010
- I'll help.

268
00:18:39.552 --> 00:18:42.789
- Did you want me to take
over the tent situation?

269
00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:43.656
- Please.

270
00:18:49.596 --> 00:18:51.664
- I can already feel the burns.

271
00:18:52.665 --> 00:18:54.167
- Come here. I'll do you back.

272
00:18:55.402 --> 00:18:56.469
- Please!

273
00:18:57.604 --> 00:18:59.272
It's the only place
I can't reach.

274
00:19:02.175 --> 00:19:05.345
- Oh my God. remember our first
holiday away with the girls?

275
00:19:06.446 --> 00:19:08.648
- Oh my God. our 18th!

276
00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:11.651
We went to Spain and
got totally wasted.

277
00:19:12.752 --> 00:19:13.553
- God.

278
00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.556
mental in a lot of ways.

279
00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:20.293
- Um. all done?

280
00:19:20.327 --> 00:19:23.330
- Ah. well. I hadn't
done the other side. but-

281
00:19:23.363 --> 00:19:25.732
- It's fine. the sun's
setting soon anyway. so.

282
00:19:29.035 --> 00:19:31.204
- You know. you don't
have to be like this.

283
00:19:34.774 --> 00:19:36.509
Every time anyone
brings up that trip.

284
00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.044
you just get all awkward
and you won't speak

285
00:19:38.044 --> 00:19:40.079
to me for the rest of the night.

286
00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:40.913
- No I don't.

287
00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:43.283
- Okay.

288
00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:45.084
- Stop making it weird.

289
00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:46.286
- I don't think I am.

290
00:19:49.556 --> 00:19:50.490
It was just a kiss.

291
00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:55.127
- Could someone give us a
hand with the logs. please?

292
00:19:55.161 --> 00:19:56.496
- Wow. mum. let me help.

293
00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:02.369
Thanks. thanks. thanks.

294
00:20:02.402 --> 00:20:03.202
Phew.

295
00:20:09.642 --> 00:20:11.611
Thought you'd have
them up by now.

296
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.562
- Who's best man for
the wedding. then?

297
00:21:35.595 --> 00:21:37.597
- Um. he works with Tim.

298
00:21:37.597 --> 00:21:38.998
He's worked with Tim for a
couple of years at his job-

299
00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:40.132
Oh. so
he's born into it?

300
00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:42.669
- Oh. come on!

301
00:21:42.735 --> 00:21:46.105
- Tim is so-
- He's not that bad!

302
00:21:46.105 --> 00:21:47.907
- Slightly!
- He's not bad at all!

303
00:21:47.907 --> 00:21:49.442
- Yeah mum. thanks mum!

304
00:21:49.442 --> 00:21:50.242
He's just
got one of these rubbish.

305
00:21:50.276 --> 00:21:51.511
stuffy-looking jobs.

306
00:21:51.544 --> 00:21:54.113
That website looks
terribly important.

307
00:21:54.113 --> 00:21:55.915
- Ha. he does.
- He's a very nice man.

308
00:21:55.948 --> 00:21:57.083
- He is!

309
00:21:57.083 --> 00:21:58.585
I'm marrying him. so-
- Of course!

310
00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.387
- I mean. who wants to
be described as nice?

311
00:22:00.387 --> 00:22:01.187
Come on!

312
00:22:02.355 --> 00:22:04.591
It's like being
described as vanilla.

313
00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:05.825
- I seem to recall
that I was the one

314
00:22:05.892 --> 00:22:08.160
who introduced you to
Tim in the first place.

315
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.629
- Sort of!

316
00:22:09.696 --> 00:22:10.930
- Oh come on. I introduced
you to him because

317
00:22:10.963 --> 00:22:13.766
of that douchebag guy I
was dating at the time.

318
00:22:13.766 --> 00:22:16.869
- Oh yeah. well.
something Tim always likes

319
00:22:16.936 --> 00:22:19.472
to remind me is that we
actually dated online

320
00:22:19.472 --> 00:22:21.273
a few years prior.

321
00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:22.475
- Oh my God. how
did I not know that?

322
00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:25.277
- I dunno. but yeah. we
chatted online first.

323
00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:27.146
But you are right in
that you did sort of

324
00:22:27.213 --> 00:22:28.615
set the actual date up.

325
00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:31.150
- What can I say?

326
00:22:31.217 --> 00:22:32.519
Dating agency over here.

327
00:22:33.786 --> 00:22:35.187
Dating
agency and tour guide.

328
00:22:36.389 --> 00:22:37.590
- Well. can you hurry
up and find me a man

329
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.926
because I think I'm
gonna be single forever.

330
00:22:41.761 --> 00:22:45.231
- Don't worry. Lizzie. I'll
marry you if no one else will.

331
00:22:45.231 --> 00:22:47.400
- Oh no. can you
imagine my dad's face?

332
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.335
- What. you don't think
he'd approve of me?

333
00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:51.504
- No. he's a
homophobic little shit!

334
00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:54.607
- You know. it's a
shame that generation

335
00:22:54.607 --> 00:22:56.242
haven't changed their mindset.

336
00:22:56.275 --> 00:22:59.412
- If his generation. I'm
guessing. is the same as mine.

337
00:22:59.446 --> 00:23:00.847
you need to understand
we were brought up

338
00:23:00.847 --> 00:23:02.949
in a totally different time.

339
00:23:02.949 --> 00:23:06.385
It was assumed you'd be a
carbon copy of your parents.

340
00:23:06.453 --> 00:23:08.254
Anyone who went in a
different direction

341
00:23:08.287 --> 00:23:10.289
was regarded as
being a bit weird.

342
00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:14.393
- Yeah. but I mean we know
so much different now.

343
00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:16.429
How would you feel if
Casey or her sister

344
00:23:16.496 --> 00:23:17.997
turned out to be a lesbian?

345
00:23:17.997 --> 00:23:20.767
- Well. you always want
grandchildren. don't you?

346
00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:22.769
So that's where it
gets a bit hard.

347
00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:37.484
- You can still have
grandchildren. though.

348
00:23:37.484 --> 00:23:38.685
Just because you're gay

349
00:23:38.685 --> 00:23:40.052
doesn't mean you can't
have grandchildren.

350
00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:41.588
- Yes. yes. of course.

351
00:23:41.588 --> 00:23:43.089
Of course you could. yes.

352
00:23:51.798 --> 00:23:54.066
- Well. I think we all need
another bottle of wine.

353
00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:56.202
and then we'll go to bed.

354
00:23:56.202 --> 00:23:57.436
Great plan.

355
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.038
We all need to be up
super early tomorrow.

356
00:23:59.038 --> 00:24:00.006
Cheers. everyone!

357
00:24:00.006 --> 00:24:02.074
Thank you for a lovely hen do!

358
00:24:02.108 --> 00:24:03.042
Cheers.

359
00:24:08.147 --> 00:24:09.749
- If we carry on like
this. someone's going

360
00:24:09.749 --> 00:24:10.750
to ask us what's up.

361
00:24:16.055 --> 00:24:19.425
It was a one time
thing. what we did.

362
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.795
It isn't something
to hold on to.

363
00:24:24.731 --> 00:24:26.799
- It wasn't just one
time. though. was it?

364
00:24:28.334 --> 00:24:30.369
- what do you
expect from me. Ava?

365
00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:31.203
Look. I'm not.

366
00:24:32.672 --> 00:24:35.575
I'm not trying to make you
feel like shit. I'm just.

367
00:24:37.276 --> 00:24:38.945
just thought we
got past all this.

368
00:24:46.285 --> 00:24:48.187
- I just feel like it wouldn't

369
00:24:48.187 --> 00:24:49.722
have happened the
number of times

370
00:24:49.722 --> 00:24:51.190
that it did if it was nothing.

371
00:24:54.727 --> 00:24:56.195
And I'm just finding
it hard. is all.

372
00:24:56.195 --> 00:24:57.496
to see you marry someone.

373
00:24:59.766 --> 00:25:02.368
when you don't even
know who you are yet.

374
00:25:02.368 --> 00:25:04.571
like you haven't given
yourself the chance

375
00:25:04.604 --> 00:25:08.007
to find out who
you actually are.

376
00:25:09.776 --> 00:25:12.111
- And who am I. Ava?

377
00:25:14.647 --> 00:25:16.048
- You're someone
in their mid-20s

378
00:25:16.082 --> 00:25:18.585
who hasn't lived life
enough to know yet.

379
00:25:37.136 --> 00:25:38.404
- If you want to
go home tomorrow.

380
00:25:38.404 --> 00:25:39.806
I won't hold it against you.

381
00:25:44.476 --> 00:25:45.745
- I'll see in the morning.

382
00:26:06.465 --> 00:26:09.769
- Good. girls?
- Mm. yeah. cracking actually.

383
00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:11.037
- It's great. thanks mum.

384
00:26:12.038 --> 00:26:12.839
- Ugh.

385
00:26:26.786 --> 00:26:27.586
You're up late. Ava.

386
00:26:27.654 --> 00:26:29.956
- Ah. I couldn't sleep.

387
00:26:29.956 --> 00:26:31.958
- Do you know. I had
that problem myself?

388
00:26:31.991 --> 00:26:33.225
Anyhow. don't worry.

389
00:26:33.292 --> 00:26:35.361
In a day or two you'll
have settled right in.

390
00:26:35.361 --> 00:26:36.763
- Thanks.

391
00:26:36.763 --> 00:26:38.564
- All right. so I'm
thinking we head south-bound

392
00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:39.999
for the rest of the afternoon.

393
00:26:39.999 --> 00:26:41.533
and if this map's right.

394
00:26:41.567 --> 00:26:42.769
it should take us to this
lovely little cliff spot.

395
00:26:42.802 --> 00:26:44.203
and we can watch the sunset!

396
00:26:54.681 --> 00:26:57.416
- Yara. how much hiking
is that going to involve?

397
00:26:57.449 --> 00:26:58.651
- Oh. not so much.

398
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:00.119
- Do you think it's
wise for Lizzie

399
00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:02.789
to do this much exercise
so late in her pregnancy?

400
00:27:02.855 --> 00:27:04.791
I had thought all of
this would be more

401
00:27:04.791 --> 00:27:06.558
on the relaxing side.

402
00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:08.761
- Oh. um.

403
00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:11.764
I mean. if she's in
any kind of discomfort

404
00:27:11.764 --> 00:27:13.399
we can just head back?

405
00:27:13.432 --> 00:27:15.334
- Just bear in mind. okay?

406
00:27:19.772 --> 00:27:24.777
- I'll tell you about it later.

407
00:28:02.281 --> 00:28:03.215
- You okay?

408
00:28:03.215 --> 00:28:04.016
You need a minute?

409
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:05.551
- Hang on. wait.

410
00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:09.722
- Hey guys. you carry on
going. we'll catch up.

411
00:28:09.722 --> 00:28:10.957
- You sure?

412
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.424
- Yeah. sure. we'll
meet you at the top.

413
00:28:12.491 --> 00:28:13.392
- Okay!

414
00:28:13.392 --> 00:28:14.326
Yeah. we'll just wait up here.

415
00:28:14.326 --> 00:28:15.094
Yeah. sure thing.

416
00:28:18.564 --> 00:28:20.366
- I hope they're okay.

417
00:28:30.176 --> 00:28:32.644
I'm just getting the weirdest
cravings at the moment.

418
00:28:33.746 --> 00:28:36.749
Waffles. but drenched in lemon.

419
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.920
I don't even know why. but
God if someone gave them

420
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.088
to me just now. I'd-

421
00:28:43.589 --> 00:28:45.091
- Have some water.

422
00:28:52.398 --> 00:28:53.933
You know. if this
hike's getting too much.

423
00:28:53.966 --> 00:28:56.936
we can just head back to the
camp and have a chill day.

424
00:28:56.936 --> 00:28:57.736
It's cool.

425
00:28:58.604 --> 00:28:59.972
- I think Yara would flip.

426
00:29:00.006 --> 00:29:02.041
- Oh. who cares
what Yara thinks.

427
00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:06.212
I'm just saying. if it's
too much we can head back.

428
00:29:06.245 --> 00:29:07.046
- Thanks.

429
00:29:14.386 --> 00:29:15.187
So?

430
00:29:16.722 --> 00:29:17.523
- So?

431
00:29:17.556 --> 00:29:18.724
- So. did you tell her?

432
00:29:21.227 --> 00:29:22.962
- Lizzie. why does
every conversation

433
00:29:22.962 --> 00:29:25.131
with you recently head
back to a discussion point?

434
00:29:25.164 --> 00:29:27.533
- 'Cause I think it's
important and you'll regret it

435
00:29:27.533 --> 00:29:28.334
if you don't.

436
00:29:31.403 --> 00:29:33.705
- Well. I did say something.

437
00:29:33.772 --> 00:29:34.573
Happy?

438
00:29:38.677 --> 00:29:39.478
- And?

439
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.681
- Christ!

440
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.119
- I just said I didn't feel like

441
00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:50.289
she knew herself
properly. which is true.

442
00:29:50.322 --> 00:29:51.523
She doesn't.

443
00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:52.691
She hasn't given
herself the chance.

444
00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:56.228
She just brushes it under
a rug and doesn't face it.

445
00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.332
- Yeah. but did you
tell her how you feel?

446
00:30:02.201 --> 00:30:04.036
Because you know
that's what matters.

447
00:30:09.842 --> 00:30:10.642
- Ready?

448
00:30:15.481 --> 00:30:16.482
Come on. you.

449
00:31:12.304 --> 00:31:14.073
- We definitely need
a photo of this.

450
00:31:14.073 --> 00:31:16.275
- Oh. let me. let me take one.

451
00:31:16.275 --> 00:31:18.277
You four girls. you'll
want the memory.

452
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:19.111
- Are you sure?

453
00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:23.815
- Line up. line up!

454
00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:26.585
Cheese!

455
00:31:26.652 --> 00:31:27.453
Another one?

456
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.322
Wow.

457
00:31:30.356 --> 00:31:31.357
Oh. that's lovely.

458
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:32.324
- Let me take a look. mum!

459
00:31:32.324 --> 00:31:35.127
- Of course. of course. look.

460
00:31:35.127 --> 00:31:36.428
- Ah. it's cute!

461
00:31:37.596 --> 00:31:39.631
- I cannot wait to
get those printed off.

462
00:31:39.665 --> 00:31:42.168
they're just gorgeous. oh wow.

463
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.171
My baby.

464
00:31:46.605 --> 00:31:48.975
- Oh. guys. can we have one
with me and the bump up here?

465
00:31:49.008 --> 00:31:50.977
She's being-
- Could I be in one as well?

466
00:31:50.977 --> 00:31:54.046
- Yeah. yeah.

467
00:31:54.046 --> 00:31:54.846
Yeah.

468
00:31:57.216 --> 00:31:58.017
Yeah.

469
00:32:33.319 --> 00:32:34.120
- Case?

470
00:32:36.322 --> 00:32:38.090
I think we're gonna stay here
for a bit before we head off.

471
00:32:38.124 --> 00:32:41.093
For some reason. my map's not
matching up with the signs.

472
00:32:54.206 --> 00:32:55.007
- Guys.

473
00:32:56.575 --> 00:32:59.645
I. um. I hate to be the
one to say this. but. um.

474
00:32:59.645 --> 00:33:01.447
I think I'm gonna
have to head back.

475
00:33:01.447 --> 00:33:02.848
- Of course. Lizzie.

476
00:33:02.881 --> 00:33:04.450
To tell you the truth. I'm
surprised you've come this far.

477
00:33:04.483 --> 00:33:06.085
- Oh. no. I love days like this.

478
00:33:06.085 --> 00:33:07.553
It's just.

479
00:33:07.553 --> 00:33:09.855
when you've got a bun in the
oven. you're ready to pop.

480
00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:15.361
- I'll go with
Lizzie. you guys stay.

481
00:33:15.361 --> 00:33:17.563
- No. no. you go with the girls.

482
00:33:17.563 --> 00:33:19.431
- I'm not leaving you.

483
00:33:19.465 --> 00:33:20.966
- No. go and take photos.

484
00:33:20.966 --> 00:33:22.434
I'll just chill. it's fine.

485
00:33:23.602 --> 00:33:26.405
- See you later.

486
00:33:26.438 --> 00:33:27.239
- Bye.

487
00:33:28.207 --> 00:33:29.608
- Bye.
- Yeah. see you later.

488
00:33:29.641 --> 00:33:30.476
have a nice time.

489
00:33:54.466 --> 00:33:57.336
- These creatures are not
known for their polite manners.

490
00:34:07.713 --> 00:34:10.082
I need to put a stop to
this. once and for all.

491
00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:29.161
- Bless you. Carly. making
mummy need a wee all the time.

492
00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:12.404
- I know.

493
00:36:12.404 --> 00:36:14.606
- I told you that
you'd like that.

494
00:36:17.443 --> 00:36:19.245
- That's odd.

495
00:36:19.278 --> 00:36:21.613
- In the middle of the woods?

496
00:36:21.647 --> 00:36:22.481
- Mum!

497
00:36:22.481 --> 00:36:23.282
Yara!

498
00:36:25.451 --> 00:36:26.885
- Come on. they'll take ages.

499
00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:19.305
Anybody there?

500
00:37:20.472 --> 00:37:22.040
- I don't think
there's anyone in.

501
00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:27.846
- Hey guys.

502
00:37:27.846 --> 00:37:29.315
Can we check it out?

503
00:37:29.315 --> 00:37:31.617
- Girls. I really don't
think that's a good idea.

504
00:37:41.793 --> 00:37:42.594
- It's open.

505
00:37:45.764 --> 00:37:47.466
Oh. Jesus!

506
00:37:47.533 --> 00:37:48.567
What is that smell?

507
00:37:49.535 --> 00:37:50.469
- That's gross.

508
00:38:10.389 --> 00:38:11.189
- Hello?

509
00:38:22.434 --> 00:38:23.234
Ava?

510
00:38:42.588 --> 00:38:43.389
Hello?

511
00:38:53.198 --> 00:38:56.368
I'm gonna call the
police in a minute.

512
00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:17.322
- Where are your friends?

513
00:39:18.557 --> 00:39:20.559
I told you not to
come into these woods.

514
00:42:42.761 --> 00:42:46.064
- Guys. I don't think
we should be here.

515
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:14.693
- Something isn't right here.

516
00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:21.066
We need to go.

517
00:43:22.868 --> 00:43:23.869
- Oh my God.

518
00:43:26.805 --> 00:43:27.605
- Mum!

519
00:43:30.008 --> 00:43:31.476
- I got out.

520
00:43:36.081 --> 00:43:40.551
These woods. it
knows them so well.

521
00:43:41.486 --> 00:43:43.855
You. you gotta help me.

522
00:43:43.889 --> 00:43:45.891
Help me get out of here.

523
00:43:45.924 --> 00:43:48.694
I've been running for ages.

524
00:43:48.694 --> 00:43:50.696
- Who are you running from?

525
00:43:50.729 --> 00:43:52.030
- The beast.

526
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:53.732
It captured us.

527
00:43:53.765 --> 00:43:54.565
- Who's us?

528
00:43:55.934 --> 00:43:57.769
- Me and my boyfriend.

529
00:43:57.803 --> 00:44:00.171
It captured us while
we were in the woods.

530
00:44:00.171 --> 00:44:01.639
Now. really. we've
got to go. please.

531
00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:03.441
- You're upset.
- No. we really need to go.

532
00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:04.275
No. please!

533
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:05.110
We really need to go!

534
00:44:05.176 --> 00:44:06.845
No. no. we need to go!

535
00:44:06.845 --> 00:44:07.645
No!

536
00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.361
- Get down!

537
00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:24.162
Get down!

538
00:44:28.199 --> 00:44:29.000
- Yara!

539
00:44:36.107 --> 00:44:36.908
Yara!

540
00:44:37.809 --> 00:44:38.609
- Ava!

541
00:44:38.643 --> 00:44:39.711
Ava. help me!

542
00:44:40.912 --> 00:44:41.713
Get her up!

543
00:45:01.767 --> 00:45:03.835
- No. no. no. no. no. no.

544
00:45:06.237 --> 00:45:07.806
Please. no. no. no!

545
00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:13.011
Please. no. please.
no please. no!

546
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.352
No. no. no. no.

547
00:45:27.826 --> 00:45:29.027
- Keep going!

548
00:45:29.094 --> 00:45:29.895
Run!

549
00:45:32.931 --> 00:45:33.731
Quick!

550
00:46:10.468 --> 00:46:11.402
- It's okay.

551
00:46:11.402 --> 00:46:14.272
Okay. deep breathes. okay?

552
00:46:14.305 --> 00:46:15.473
Bear the pain.

553
00:46:16.707 --> 00:46:18.309
Okay?

554
00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:21.679
Shh. breathe. you're fine!

555
00:46:21.679 --> 00:46:22.480
It's okay.

556
00:46:24.049 --> 00:46:25.216
Look at me. look
at me. you're fine.

557
00:46:25.216 --> 00:46:26.017
All right?

558
00:46:30.755 --> 00:46:34.492
- These woods. you need to
know them well to get out.

559
00:46:36.928 --> 00:46:37.728
- Yara.

560
00:46:38.763 --> 00:46:39.664
she had the map.

561
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.204
- It's okay. I think we
just keep heading this way.

562
00:46:46.204 --> 00:46:47.272
I think I remember it.

563
00:46:48.773 --> 00:46:50.208
- And what if you don't?

564
00:46:50.241 --> 00:46:53.811
What if she's right
and. and we get lost

565
00:46:53.811 --> 00:46:56.081
and we end up back
at that cabin?

566
00:46:56.081 --> 00:46:59.851
- I know. it's this
way. just trust me.

567
00:47:03.121 --> 00:47:04.655
- Oh my God.

568
00:47:04.689 --> 00:47:05.756
- What is it?

569
00:47:07.325 --> 00:47:08.626
- Fuck!
- Lizzie.

570
00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:12.130
- Yara had the car keys!

571
00:47:12.163 --> 00:47:13.431
- We keep running.
- Mum!

572
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.602
You can't run any further
than that campsite

573
00:47:17.635 --> 00:47:19.437
and it's still a mile off. shit!

574
00:47:21.006 --> 00:47:22.240
We need those keys.

575
00:47:23.308 --> 00:47:24.775
- I'll go.

576
00:47:24.809 --> 00:47:28.013
I'll get the keys and I'll
meet you back at the campsite.

577
00:47:28.947 --> 00:47:29.747
- No.

578
00:47:31.216 --> 00:47:34.085
Ava. you seem to be the only
one who even knows the way back

579
00:47:34.085 --> 00:47:35.353
to the campsite.

580
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:38.523
It doesn't make any
sense if you go.

581
00:47:38.523 --> 00:47:39.891
- Well. I don't know
what to suggest.

582
00:47:39.925 --> 00:47:40.992
We need those keys.

583
00:47:43.628 --> 00:47:44.562
- I'll go.

584
00:47:44.562 --> 00:47:47.032
- Casey. no. no honey. no. no-

585
00:47:48.233 --> 00:47:50.868
- Mum. mum. shh-
- Please. no. no!

586
00:47:50.936 --> 00:47:51.736
- Think about it. look-

587
00:47:51.769 --> 00:47:53.238
- Oh. God!

588
00:47:53.238 --> 00:47:56.007
- I can get back there. I
can find the keys. the map.

589
00:47:57.108 --> 00:47:58.109
and then I'll get myself back.

590
00:47:58.176 --> 00:47:59.644
Look. look.

591
00:47:59.644 --> 00:48:00.545
Ava will take you back to
the campsite. all right?

592
00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:02.013
I'm not gonna be far behind you.

593
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:05.316
Lizzie. she's on her own.

594
00:48:05.316 --> 00:48:06.151
She's not safe!

595
00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:07.385
- Well. neither are you!

596
00:48:08.853 --> 00:48:12.057
- If we want to get out of
here. we've got to do this.

597
00:48:13.591 --> 00:48:17.162
- That thing. its face.

598
00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:20.631
that thing was a troll.

599
00:48:22.067 --> 00:48:23.001
- A troll?

600
00:48:23.001 --> 00:48:25.436
What. like the urban legend?

601
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:28.673
- They are reputed
to live near caves.

602
00:48:28.706 --> 00:48:30.841
they hunt in the
woodland for prey

603
00:48:30.841 --> 00:48:32.843
to bring back to their families.

604
00:48:49.694 --> 00:48:50.495
- Go.

605
00:48:51.596 --> 00:48:53.198
Take my mum.

606
00:48:53.198 --> 00:48:54.165
Get out of here.

607
00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.135
- Hurry back to us.

608
00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:47.852
Okay. just. just hold on.

609
00:49:51.889 --> 00:49:53.391
Just a tiny bit further.

610
00:49:59.164 --> 00:49:59.964
- Oh God.

611
00:50:02.267 --> 00:50:03.068
Oh no.

612
00:50:08.373 --> 00:50:09.174
Oh God.

613
00:50:10.975 --> 00:50:11.976
- Stay with Keeley.

614
00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:42.640
- Do you see her?

615
00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.441
Lizzie?

616
00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.452
- She's not there.

617
00:50:54.452 --> 00:50:55.720
- Oh. thank God.

618
00:50:58.456 --> 00:50:59.590
- The troll's been here.

619
00:51:00.825 --> 00:51:01.959
We need to go.

620
00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:25.850
Hold my hand.

621
00:51:49.006 --> 00:51:49.807
- No!

622
00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.409
Run!

623
00:51:51.442 --> 00:51:52.243
Run!

624
00:52:00.185 --> 00:52:02.387
- Get off me!
- No!

625
00:52:02.387 --> 00:52:04.389
Get off me!

626
00:53:07.084 --> 00:53:10.788
- It won't stop
until it gets us.

627
00:53:16.561 --> 00:53:19.430
- How long were you down there?

628
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:20.231
- I don't know.

629
00:53:21.366 --> 00:53:22.800
I lost track of days.

630
00:53:24.802 --> 00:53:28.273
I counted five. then I
don't know after that.

631
00:53:31.075 --> 00:53:32.877
- What did it do
to you In that hut?

632
00:53:34.078 --> 00:53:37.114
- It made me live as
some kind of slave.

633
00:53:39.149 --> 00:53:41.752
Tied me down.

634
00:53:41.786 --> 00:53:45.390
Beat me like a dog into
obeying its instructions.

635
00:53:46.824 --> 00:53:50.395
It would eat rodents.
and make me eat too.

636
00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:56.601
Some kind of eating ritual
where it made us compete

637
00:53:56.601 --> 00:53:58.403
for who finished first.

638
00:54:04.208 --> 00:54:05.876
- We're gonna wait here
until Casey comes back

639
00:54:05.876 --> 00:54:06.677
with those keys.

640
00:54:07.878 --> 00:54:09.614
And then we're gonna get
so far away from here.

641
00:54:09.647 --> 00:54:11.849
and we're never gonna look back.

642
00:54:16.354 --> 00:54:19.524
We're gonna get out
before we're gone.

643
00:54:28.232 --> 00:54:30.601
- Please. please.
no. no. please.

644
00:54:31.469 --> 00:54:32.269
Please!

645
00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:35.005
Please!

646
00:54:42.513 --> 00:54:43.814
Please!

647
00:55:29.994 --> 00:55:30.928
No. please!

648
00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:36.801
Please!

649
00:55:36.834 --> 00:55:39.737
I'll go back with
you. all right?

650
00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:40.805
I'll go back!

651
00:56:37.795 --> 00:56:39.296
- You tricked her.

652
00:58:35.079 --> 00:58:35.880
- Lizzie?

653
00:58:37.648 --> 00:58:40.150
- There's something
in the woods.

654
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:41.752
It's picking us off.

655
00:58:41.786 --> 00:58:42.720
One by one.

656
00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:47.625
- We have to get you
back to the campsite.

657
00:58:47.625 --> 00:58:48.759
- No.

658
00:58:48.759 --> 00:58:49.560
No.

659
00:58:51.729 --> 00:58:53.931
That's where it got me.

660
00:58:53.931 --> 00:58:54.999
- The others.

661
00:58:56.801 --> 00:58:59.036
they're heading back there.

662
00:59:18.923 --> 00:59:19.724
Shh.

663
00:59:58.528 --> 00:59:59.329
- Casey.

664
01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:38.035
Casey!

665
01:01:10.835 --> 01:01:11.635
- Casey.

666
01:01:31.756 --> 01:01:32.556
- Lizzie.

667
01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.176
- Oh. fuck.

668
01:01:52.176 --> 01:01:53.110
No. not now!

669
01:01:54.244 --> 01:01:55.045
Not now!

670
01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:00.317
Oh. fuck. not now.

671
01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:12.963
- Stay away from her!

672
01:02:13.998 --> 01:02:15.032
- Get away from me!

673
01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:24.074
- Lizzie!

674
01:03:50.694 --> 01:03:51.495
- My baby!

675
01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:54.031
My baby!

676
01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:56.967
Don't take her!

677
01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:01.005
Give back my baby!

678
01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:11.248
- No!

679
01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:31.161
- The keys. I'm trying to...

680
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:35.932
- No.
- Fuck.

681
01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.137
The keys.

682
01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:42.306
I dropped them. I was
trying to cut the rope.

683
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:48.078
Do you think she's okay?

684
01:05:50.247 --> 01:05:51.681
- I think she's just resting.

685
01:05:55.085 --> 01:05:57.887
We need to get the baby

686
01:05:57.887 --> 01:06:00.690
and Lizzie out of here
and to the hospital.

687
01:06:02.192 --> 01:06:04.161
- Where's my mum.
the other girl?

688
01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:10.434
- No. no. no.

689
01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:18.808
- Casey. I'm here.

690
01:06:18.842 --> 01:06:19.643
I'm here.

691
01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:22.012
- No. no.

692
01:06:24.948 --> 01:06:26.350
- I know. I know.

693
01:06:30.254 --> 01:06:32.256
But we've got to
be strong. okay?

694
01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:37.527
We have to get out of here.

695
01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:42.199
- We're never
getting out of here.

696
01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:43.267
- Yes we are.

697
01:06:45.735 --> 01:06:46.603
Look at me.

698
01:06:50.407 --> 01:06:51.208
I nev.

699
01:06:53.577 --> 01:06:56.046
I never wanted you to marry Tim

700
01:06:57.614 --> 01:07:02.519
'cause I felt like he
got in there first.

701
01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:10.094
And I felt like I'd never
get my chance with you.

702
01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:14.030
And every time we kissed.

703
01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:19.136
every time we accidentally
hooked up at a party.

704
01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:24.474
I knew it was more. and
I think we both did.

705
01:07:26.176 --> 01:07:28.278
We were just too
ashamed to admit it.

706
01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:37.154
I'm sorry.

707
01:07:37.187 --> 01:07:39.756
I'm sorry that I'm saying
all of this now. but.

708
01:07:39.756 --> 01:07:41.191
now you know.

709
01:07:41.225 --> 01:07:43.760
and now I can live the life
I was supposed to live.

710
01:07:45.629 --> 01:07:47.631
It gives me even more
of a reason to want

711
01:07:47.631 --> 01:07:48.798
to get out of here.

712
01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.270
- Ava. I-

713
01:07:53.337 --> 01:07:55.038
- You don't have to
answer right now.

714
01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:58.842
But you do have to
fight this. okay?

715
01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:01.111
Not just for you.

716
01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:07.217
For me.

717
01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:56.032
- I don't wanna.

718
01:09:00.036 --> 01:09:01.104
No. I don't...

719
01:09:11.348 --> 01:09:13.517
I'm not fucking eating it!

720
01:09:21.024 --> 01:09:22.526
I'm not eating it.

721
01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:48.051
- Get away from her!

722
01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.086
Stop. stop!

723
01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:10.474
- Okay?

724
01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:11.441
Come on.

725
01:10:11.441 --> 01:10:12.276
We'll come back for them.

726
01:10:12.309 --> 01:10:13.243
Come on.

727
01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:45.275
- We're not gonna leave Lizzie.

728
01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:47.243
- We'll come back. okay?

729
01:12:11.094 --> 01:12:12.228
- Wait!

730
01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:13.029
Lizzie!

731
01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:14.130
We can't leave her!

732
01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:15.632
- We're not.

733
01:12:15.632 --> 01:12:17.401
We're going to get the car.
we'll come back for them.

734
01:12:17.401 --> 01:12:18.835
all right?

735
01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:20.537
We've got better odds
with speed on that thing.

736
01:12:21.405 --> 01:12:23.039
- Wait.

737
01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:23.873
that church.

738
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:28.712
that priest said.

739
01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:33.917
something about an organ
and how it can stop it.

740
01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:38.455
Maybe this is what
he was talking about.

741
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:41.290
- Go to the church.

742
01:12:42.225 --> 01:12:43.960
- And trap it inside.

743
01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.156
- Ava. come on!

744
01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:53.963
Ava!

745
01:13:55.031 --> 01:13:55.832
- My back!

746
01:14:00.236 --> 01:14:01.871
- Come on. come on!

747
01:14:01.905 --> 01:14:04.508
I think we lost it. I
think we lost it. okay?

748
01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:06.510
But we've got to get
to the church. okay?

749
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:08.612
We've got to keep
going. all right?

750
01:14:08.645 --> 01:14:09.546
Okay?

751
01:14:09.546 --> 01:14:11.615
Come on. come on. you ready?

752
01:14:23.827 --> 01:14:24.628
Come on!

753
01:14:59.362 --> 01:15:00.163
You okay?

754
01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:02.532
- I'm fine.

755
01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:07.270
- Promise me?

756
01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:11.507
- Promise.

757
01:15:18.882 --> 01:15:21.918
- I. I thought I
lost you back there.

758
01:15:29.993 --> 01:15:31.561
- You still got me.

759
01:15:37.801 --> 01:15:38.602
- Good.

760
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:41.971
I'll trap it inside.

761
01:15:44.908 --> 01:15:46.910
- What if it doesn't want to go?

762
01:15:52.682 --> 01:15:54.150
- You can help me.

763
01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:56.953
You run like hell.

764
01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.189
- I'm not leaving you.

765
01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:31.554
I'll meet you at the car.

766
01:17:55.071 --> 01:17:56.172
Please. Case.

767
01:17:58.241 --> 01:17:59.042
come on.

768
01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:28.097
- Now!

769
01:19:38.207 --> 01:19:39.008
Again!

770
01:19:39.042 --> 01:19:40.109
It's working. Ava!

771
01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:40.910
Again!

772
01:19:40.977 --> 01:19:41.744
It's working!

773
01:19:45.214 --> 01:19:46.015
Again!

774
01:19:53.356 --> 01:19:54.290
Ava. again!

775
01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:04.633
It's working!

776
01:20:39.602 --> 01:20:40.403
Come on!

777
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.736
- We're gonna go get Lizzie.

778
01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:19.575
- It's gonna be okay.

779
01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:03.552
- Let's get the
hell out of here.
