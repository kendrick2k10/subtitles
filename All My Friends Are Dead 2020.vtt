00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:32.041
FIRST OF JANUARY

4
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.875
Hi.

5
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:57.541
Good morning.

6
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:26.000
Happy New Year!

7
00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.333
-What's your name again?
-Grzegorz.

8
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.916
Dąbrowski.

9
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:40.708
Junior detective.

10
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:44.625
So? Ready to pop your cherry?

11
00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:47.125
Yes. sir.

12
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:01.750
It smells terrible in here.

13
00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.333
You'll get used to it.

14
00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:08.916
I just have a weak stomach and…

15
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:14.958
End of the world… My fault…

16
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:17.625
All my friends are dead… Why?

17
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:26.958
What do we have here?

18
00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:43.916
I'm sorry. I was just…

19
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.791
It's just… my stomach and all…

20
00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:49.166
Thank you. sir.

21
00:02:50.916 --> 00:02:52.458
I'm fine now.

22
00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:55.791
Oh. God.

23
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.375
Inspector. sir…

24
00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:02.541
Surely you took that paper
out of your own pocket? Right?

25
00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:03.916
Inspector. sir!

26
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.916
Sir. we've just potentially
destroyed key evidence.

27
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.125
We have to report this.

28
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.208
Whoa.

29
00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:20.083
What the hell happened here. sir?

30
00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:24.583
To say it in a language you'd understand:

31
00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:27.708
an epic fail.

32
00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:30.875
-What?
-Never mind.

33
00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:36.166
For starters. tell me where
the parents were during this carnage.

34
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.333
Holidaying at the Tatra mountains.

35
00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:42.291
Holidays at the mountains.

36
00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:43.708
How original.

37
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:48.875
They went up a hill.
and everything went downhill from there.

38
00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:52.125
-See what I mean?
-Are you being funny?

39
00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:54.875
No. sir. I'm sorry.

40
00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:58.166
And where are they now?

41
00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:07.208
In hospital. The mother experienced
a psychogenic shock when they came home.

42
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:10.500
She's now on medication.
So is the father. Under sedatives.

43
00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:12.791
He was suicidal.

44
00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:16.083
He can't forgive himself for
leaving a gun in the house.

45
00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:17.750
Is his gun licensed?

46
00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:21.208
Yes. He's an amateur collector.

47
00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:24.708
Passionate about guns. in general.

48
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.041
What a mess.

49
00:04:28.791 --> 00:04:31.416
Oh. how did you end up here?

50
00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:36.875
Pretty thing… isn't it?

51
00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:39.750
Well. yes.

52
00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:46.291
What does it tell you. sir?

53
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:50.833
That my wife will sure appreciate it.

54
00:04:55.583 --> 00:04:56.666
Come on.

55
00:05:02.416 --> 00:05:04.583
So we have both parents in hospital.

56
00:05:04.666 --> 00:05:07.250
their daughter in a drunk tank…

57
00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:09.791
-A youth shelter.
-And their son?

58
00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:11.750
Marek.

59
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.583
-Is this Marek?
-This is Marek.

60
00:05:14.666 --> 00:05:16.291
Marek was home alone.

61
00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:19.583
Just like Kevin. Looks like
he threw a killer party. too.

62
00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:22.833
-What did I say about being funny?
-Not to go down that road.

63
00:05:22.916 --> 00:05:25.041
Write that down. That's rule number two.

64
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.416
Looks like. due to being ball-gagged.

65
00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:40.916
this guy choked to death on his own vomit.

66
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:44.625
What a terrible way to go.

67
00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:49.041
You may have heard
my last partner died in action.

68
00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:01.833
So what are you thinking. sir?

69
00:06:03.541 --> 00:06:05.916
Based on all the clues…

70
00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:08.791
I can summarize it as:

71
00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.291
Something went wrong.

72
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.208
-Can we do this now?
-Yes.

73
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:18.500
Come on.

74
00:06:19.916 --> 00:06:21.125
Take one. please.

75
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:25.500
I always get a picture taken
with a new partner.

76
00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:18.291
THE DAY BEFORE

77
00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:25.833
-You excited?
-Yeah.

78
00:07:27.166 --> 00:07:29.000
I'll finally meet your friends.

79
00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.750
Yeah. Marek and all the rest.

80
00:07:32.666 --> 00:07:34.041
Cool.

81
00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:35.666
Something's wrong?

82
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.541
Everything's fine.
I didn't sleep enough last night.

83
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.583
My sleepyhead!

84
00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:42.916
Ugh! Get a room. you two!

85
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.125
-Oliwia!
-Hi. pretty face.

86
00:07:45.208 --> 00:07:48.458
-What are you doing here?
-You thought you could hide from me?

87
00:07:48.541 --> 00:07:50.000
Mommy called me.

88
00:07:50.083 --> 00:07:53.333
She's over the moon about
her son coming back from college.

89
00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:56.416
-She gave us a lecture on her daughter.
-What did she say?

90
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.416
Oh. you know.
the dangers of sleeping around.

91
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.625
STDs and all that.
Great Christmas dinner conversation.

92
00:08:02.708 --> 00:08:04.166
Your drug use worries her.

93
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.458
-What did you tell her?
-To panic more.

94
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:09.291
Hi!

95
00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:10.791
Why her? She's not invited.

96
00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:12.333
You!

97
00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:14.458
You must be Angelica.

98
00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:19.250
This guy talks so much about you.
I even know your bra size.

99
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:20.916
That's me. 34B!

100
00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:23.541
Here you go! She's also funny!

101
00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:26.375
-Hi. man.
-Hi.

102
00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:32.208
As a rule. you can go
anywhere but upstairs.

103
00:08:32.291 --> 00:08:34.166
My folks' rule. Bathroom's here.

104
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.875
The living room is the party.
The kitchen. aka booze and food.

105
00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.208
Filip! Take a pic of us?

106
00:08:40.291 --> 00:08:41.250
Sure.

107
00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:45.041
That's Filip. Our party photographer.
Just came out of drug rehab.

108
00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:47.375
You were to keep it discreet.

109
00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:49.083
I told you before!

110
00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:52.291
The first step to recovery
is admitting you have a problem.

111
00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:54.625
Isn't he just great? Irreplaceable.

112
00:08:54.708 --> 00:08:56.458
Our lovely Marek.

113
00:08:56.541 --> 00:08:59.375
Filip… He just hit a rough patch
with drugs.

114
00:08:59.458 --> 00:09:00.916
but he's a really cool guy.

115
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.208
A little oversensitive
or dramatic perhaps.

116
00:09:03.291 --> 00:09:05.208
But. you know. small and harmless.

117
00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:09.125
These two former lovebirds
are Anastasia and Jordan.

118
00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:15.041
They used to be happy.
but there's not much happiness left.

119
00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:20.000
She's more into spirituality.
he'd rather be another Post Malone.

120
00:09:20.083 --> 00:09:23.916
You promised to spend tonight with me!
You know how special this is to me.

121
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.250
-Not now. babe.
-When then?

122
00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:30.208
Would you give me some space?
I'm trying to focus on essentials here.

123
00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:33.791
You're distracting me.
We'll hang out later!

124
00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:34.750
Right…

125
00:09:38.416 --> 00:09:40.583
This is Jacques. He's French.

126
00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:43.166
-A Mormon. apparently.
-A Mormon?

127
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.458
Two missionaries knocked
on my door yesterday.

128
00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:49.333
I took them for Jehovah's witnesses.
started yelling at them. as you do.

129
00:09:49.416 --> 00:09:52.208
But in fact they came 'cause
they found my lost wallet.

130
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:54.791
Get it? If a God exists.
He must totally like me.

131
00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:57.625
So for good karma. in order to thank them.

132
00:09:57.708 --> 00:10:00.250
I invited them to the party.
Only he showed up.

133
00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:02.500
He can't speak much Polish but he's OK.

134
00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.333
What was that?

135
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:12.083
Check out these two.

136
00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:18.333
Robert and Rafał.
They're like Jay and Silent Bob.

137
00:10:18.416 --> 00:10:23.000
Always reaching for the stars. end up
jerking off to someone's mother's picture.

138
00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:25.125
Stock comic relief.

139
00:10:35.583 --> 00:10:38.458
They wouldn't get pussy at the BunnyRanch.

140
00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:45.083
Now. on the flip side.
here's lover boy Dariusz.

141
00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:47.791
Hot chicks always swarm around him.

142
00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:49.625
Are you two sisters or something?

143
00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:51.041
-Yes!
-Yeah?

144
00:10:51.125 --> 00:10:52.541
Astral sisters.

145
00:10:53.083 --> 00:10:55.250
He started with the kindergarten ladies.

146
00:10:56.291 --> 00:10:58.250
Every superhero has his origin story.

147
00:10:58.333 --> 00:11:01.541
And. as you know. with great power
comes great responsibility.

148
00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:06.708
Hey! You piece of shit!
You're with some skanks?

149
00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:09.666
-Shut up. bitches!
-Renia. don't.

150
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.250
-Peace!
-Easy. girls.

151
00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:14.625
-Who are these fucking sluts?
-What are you doing here?

152
00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:17.500
Well. you said we needed a break.

153
00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:18.708
Right. a break.

154
00:11:18.791 --> 00:11:20.041
A break doesn't mean

155
00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:22.416
you can go around
fucking any slut you see.

156
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.083
It does too. Besides. what sluts?
See how cool they are.

157
00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:29.375
Baby… you said we were great.

158
00:11:29.458 --> 00:11:31.625
-We are great together!
-Wrong. Pinky.

159
00:11:31.708 --> 00:11:34.583
We fucked once. and you've been
dogging me for two months.

160
00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:35.833
-Three months!
-Exactly.

161
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.458
Man. what the fuck?

162
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:40.291
I let you piss on me!

163
00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:42.916
Big deal. everyone pisses on
everyone else now.

164
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.250
Come on. these days it's like kissing.

165
00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:46.916
-No pissing on me!
-Bummer.

166
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.750
-On me neither!
-Come on. girls.

167
00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.416
She's just being ridiculous. It'll pass.

168
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.500
Bye!

169
00:11:55.666 --> 00:11:56.916
Pinky. calm down!

170
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.791
Listen to me. you loon.
We are done now. OK?

171
00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:02.375
Finished. Single. Kaput. Game over.

172
00:12:02.458 --> 00:12:05.916
There's the door.
Get out and let me live for once.

173
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.791
I hope you choke! And die!

174
00:12:14.125 --> 00:12:15.250
Hey. Daro!

175
00:12:18.708 --> 00:12:21.416
Quit joking around.
You'll attract bad aura.

176
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.833
Come on. the party's just begun!

177
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.708
You know I'd never piss on you.

178
00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:30.333
I know.

179
00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:36.000
How cute. you two. Romeo and Juliet.
OK. guys. have fun. Enjoy the party.

180
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.416
Men are pigs!

181
00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:48.958
-So you like it?
-Do I like whom?

182
00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:52.625
-The necklace.
-Ah. yes. it's very nice.

183
00:12:54.125 --> 00:12:57.208
-You don't like it.
-I do like it!

184
00:12:57.291 --> 00:12:59.416
I still have the receipt.
we can return it.

185
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.750
Paweł. it's really beautiful.
Come on. relax.

186
00:13:26.916 --> 00:13:28.416
Who's this now?

187
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.333
-Hello. Marek!
-My man!

188
00:13:31.416 --> 00:13:34.583
-This is Gloria. And this is Marek.
-Hello.

189
00:13:34.666 --> 00:13:36.916
What a surprise.
Have you been dating long?

190
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.666
-Three months.
-We're not dating.

191
00:13:39.208 --> 00:13:40.791
I mean…

192
00:13:40.875 --> 00:13:43.291
We've been meeting for a few months.

193
00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:45.500
But we're not an item. we're not dating.

194
00:13:45.583 --> 00:13:47.375
No. we're not doing that at all.

195
00:13:47.916 --> 00:13:50.541
I mean. we are doing that.

196
00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:53.583
but we're not
in a relationship. It's not--

197
00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.083
-Got any drinks?
-Sure.

198
00:13:55.166 --> 00:13:56.583
-What would you like?
-Wine.

199
00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:58.250
Wine…

200
00:13:58.333 --> 00:13:59.958
You know. I don't think so.

201
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.541
But we have champagne.

202
00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:05.375
For the midnight toast.
but it's yours if you want it.

203
00:14:05.458 --> 00:14:07.291
Of course I want it!

204
00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:08.916
Wonderful.

205
00:14:12.541 --> 00:14:14.166
Wonderful.

206
00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:20.458
So how did you two meet?

207
00:14:21.125 --> 00:14:24.083
We met at a funeral.

208
00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:25.583
Cool!

209
00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:29.125
I mean not cool for… you know who.

210
00:14:29.208 --> 00:14:30.666
Relax.

211
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.500
-Who kicked the bucket?
-Bogdan!

212
00:14:32.583 --> 00:14:35.083
Jordan! Not Bogdan.
How many times must I tell you?

213
00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:38.125
Paweł's grandma died.
I knew her daughter… His mother.

214
00:14:38.208 --> 00:14:41.375
It's amazing! The way the universe
brings people together.

215
00:14:41.458 --> 00:14:42.416
You wanna play?

216
00:14:43.041 --> 00:14:43.916
Sure.

217
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.041
When you eliminate clutter from life.

218
00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:51.125
you create space for the universe
to unite kindred spirits.

219
00:14:51.208 --> 00:14:52.250
like the two of you.

220
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:56.041
So you're saying his grandmother died

221
00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:57.916
to make room for Gloria?

222
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.291
Stop being so basic!
When something bad happens in life.

223
00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:04.416
then something good comes out of that.

224
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.833
I see. Like The Lion King
The circle of life.

225
00:15:06.916 --> 00:15:09.875
Yes. like The Lion King. Exactly.

226
00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.166
The circle of life symbolizes
the sacred and divine universe.

227
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.958
-Universe. shmuniverse. Let's play!
-I'm telling you.

228
00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.000
-Damn.
-It was close.

229
00:15:19.083 --> 00:15:22.708
Gloria. you're only meant to
drink after he scores!

230
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.000
That's the spirit!

231
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.250
You two probably match
in astrology as well.

232
00:15:30.333 --> 00:15:31.666
What are your signs?

233
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.291
-I'm…
-Wait. let me guess.

234
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.416
You are…

235
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.625
a Gemini.

236
00:15:39.708 --> 00:15:42.416
-And Gloria must be…
-I know!

237
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.208
Gloria is a Siren.

238
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:48.208
-An Aquarius. She's an Aquarius.
-Paweł. let's dance!

239
00:15:49.166 --> 00:15:52.166
Right now. I don't quite…
I don't feel like it.

240
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.708
So now dancing goes on
the growing list of things you don't do?

241
00:15:55.791 --> 00:15:57.375
We can still…

242
00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.083
So you're saying…

243
00:16:00.166 --> 00:16:02.458
you can tap her without having to commit?

244
00:16:03.791 --> 00:16:05.333
Pretty much.

245
00:16:05.416 --> 00:16:06.500
Damn.

246
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:09.666
I'd kill a grandma. too.
if someone took her place.

247
00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.000
Jerk!

248
00:16:12.583 --> 00:16:15.416
There's just one thing. man.

249
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.583
When she drinks. she goes crazy.

250
00:16:18.666 --> 00:16:20.333
She loses control.

251
00:16:20.416 --> 00:16:24.166
Man. this is great! Bitches be crazy.

252
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.833
I guess. It's just…

253
00:16:25.916 --> 00:16:28.166
She's kinda keeping me at a distance.

254
00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:32.375
Everything's fine.
we get along really well.

255
00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:33.916
She's very smart.

256
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.875
And then. there's the sex.

257
00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.000
Good?

258
00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.541
Hang on…

259
00:16:39.625 --> 00:16:42.833
I sense from you
a flow of positive energy.

260
00:16:43.458 --> 00:16:44.958
Are you in love?

261
00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:47.333
What a loser! You're in love?

262
00:16:47.416 --> 00:16:49.291
No way. man. Which reminds me:

263
00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.791
They're in love. hah! Rah-rah-rah-rah!

264
00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:57.833
Man. my track will blow you away.
A sure hit. let me play it for you.

265
00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:08.166
Fuck!

266
00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:38.250
To be great is to go on…

267
00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:41.041
To go on is to go far…

268
00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:43.958
To go far is to be brave…

269
00:17:44.041 --> 00:17:45.958
To be great is to go on…

270
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:47.833
To go on is to go far…

271
00:17:47.916 --> 00:17:50.708
To go far is to be brave…

272
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:04.666
-Hi. hello.
-Hi!

273
00:18:05.458 --> 00:18:08.458
Look. I did something kinda stupid.

274
00:18:08.541 --> 00:18:11.250
I spilt some booze on your camera.

275
00:18:11.833 --> 00:18:12.708
Oh.

276
00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:15.666
Sorry. I feel like an idiot.

277
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.875
Well. don't. It should be OK.

278
00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.083
-All good. don't worry.
-Yeah?

279
00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:23.166
-Yeah. it works.
-Cool!

280
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.708
Then how about…
you join me for a joint?

281
00:18:26.791 --> 00:18:27.833
A peace pipe.

282
00:18:29.333 --> 00:18:31.166
You know what? I can't.

283
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.750
-You can't?
-I really shouldn't.

284
00:18:33.833 --> 00:18:35.541
You can't or you shouldn't?

285
00:18:35.625 --> 00:18:40.083
Not that I don't want to.
because I do. I totally would…

286
00:18:40.875 --> 00:18:43.500
The forbidden fruit is the sweetest.

287
00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:46.916
I know.

288
00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:50.166
Quit the bullshit. let's go.

289
00:18:54.541 --> 00:18:56.458
Moretti's Pizza. best pizza in town.

290
00:18:56.541 --> 00:18:58.416
Really? That good?

291
00:18:59.458 --> 00:19:01.333
Best pizza in town.

292
00:19:01.416 --> 00:19:02.708
No kidding.

293
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:04.875
Working on New Year's Eve sucks. huh?

294
00:19:06.791 --> 00:19:08.041
A little bit.

295
00:19:08.125 --> 00:19:10.000
I'd hang myself if I were you.

296
00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:13.625
OK. it'll be 560.

297
00:19:13.708 --> 00:19:16.125
Whoa! Does that include a stripper?

298
00:19:16.208 --> 00:19:18.958
Is she in these boxes?
Gonna jump right out?

299
00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:19.916
No.

300
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.666
-Are you the stripper?
-No.

301
00:19:22.375 --> 00:19:23.791
Relax. it's a joke.

302
00:19:23.875 --> 00:19:25.708
Your sense of humor froze up?

303
00:19:25.791 --> 00:19:27.541
Can you just pay me?

304
00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:30.250
You know what.
I don't have any money on me.

305
00:19:31.083 --> 00:19:32.500
Can you wait a second?

306
00:19:33.625 --> 00:19:36.000
Driver 4. where are you?
Driver 4. answer.

307
00:19:37.208 --> 00:19:38.833
-I'm in a real hurry.
-Sure.

308
00:19:38.916 --> 00:19:42.333
I'll be quick as a…
as something that's really quick.

309
00:19:42.416 --> 00:19:43.958
Just be quick. yeah?

310
00:19:45.208 --> 00:19:46.333
I'll be back.

311
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.458
OK.

312
00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:52.541
Got it?

313
00:19:53.541 --> 00:19:55.125
I'll think of a better one.

314
00:20:03.291 --> 00:20:06.291
-You mentioned a guitar?
-Sure! I'll bring it in a sec.

315
00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:37.083
French poodle.

316
00:20:45.583 --> 00:20:49.083
RAFAŁ: I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE! BATHROOM?

317
00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:51.458
CUPCAKE: MIDNIGHT. UPSTAIRS. BE READY!

318
00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:53.250
Why all this texting?

319
00:20:53.791 --> 00:20:55.833
I'm texting this… chick.

320
00:20:58.375 --> 00:20:59.458
A chick?

321
00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:01.125
Yeah. right.

322
00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:05.000
-I wonder who would text you.
-Your mother.

323
00:21:08.916 --> 00:21:10.541
Speaking of MILFs…

324
00:21:12.583 --> 00:21:14.541
-Check her out.
-Yeah.

325
00:21:16.166 --> 00:21:17.666
What a hottie.

326
00:21:18.666 --> 00:21:19.958
Right?

327
00:21:20.041 --> 00:21:21.041
What a…

328
00:21:21.625 --> 00:21:22.875
slut!

329
00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:24.083
Uh-huh.

330
00:21:25.041 --> 00:21:26.666
Let's go fuck her.

331
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.041
What?

332
00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:29.458
Let's fuck her!

333
00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:31.916
Sure. except…

334
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.666
it's not just gonna happen
if we keep standing around.

335
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:36.708
So?

336
00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:38.666
-Move it.
-You first!

337
00:21:39.875 --> 00:21:43.208
-I was first last time.
-Me. twice before. It's your turn.

338
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.250
Are you chickening out?

339
00:21:45.333 --> 00:21:46.708
Who? Me?

340
00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:47.750
You got no balls.

341
00:21:47.833 --> 00:21:49.291
No balls. me?!

342
00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:50.500
I'm going!

343
00:22:14.541 --> 00:22:15.958
Yo. dude.

344
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:17.416
Huh?

345
00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:20.916
I wonder why we need chicks at all…

346
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.750
when there's pizza.

347
00:22:23.666 --> 00:22:26.166
They are probably for other things.

348
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.208
Don't you think?

349
00:22:27.291 --> 00:22:31.166
Right. Laundry. cleaning. Cooking.

350
00:22:32.541 --> 00:22:34.875
Although you can order that too.

351
00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:44.333
Well. what do you think?

352
00:22:46.916 --> 00:22:49.875
We met two years ago.
You're proposing already?

353
00:22:49.958 --> 00:22:51.416
Please. stop.

354
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.250
You made me tear up.

355
00:22:53.333 --> 00:22:54.708
Very funny.

356
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:57.541
You're showing me a ring.
What's this?

357
00:22:57.625 --> 00:22:59.625
I'm proposing to Angelica tonight.

358
00:23:01.041 --> 00:23:02.750
The fuck's wrong with you?

359
00:23:03.458 --> 00:23:04.291
How's it going?

360
00:23:04.375 --> 00:23:06.125
-What?
-You know…

361
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:09.416
Anything getting better?

362
00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:11.375
Jesus…

363
00:23:11.458 --> 00:23:13.541
I only told you because I was drunk.

364
00:23:13.625 --> 00:23:16.083
Honey. I'm asking for your sake!

365
00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:18.375
I've thought it through. It's time.

366
00:23:18.458 --> 00:23:20.500
-She's great.
-Thought it through?

367
00:23:20.583 --> 00:23:22.833
-It's been ten months…
-Ten months?

368
00:23:23.583 --> 00:23:24.791
How many times?

369
00:23:25.958 --> 00:23:27.583
You mean…

370
00:23:27.666 --> 00:23:28.708
Sex good?

371
00:23:28.791 --> 00:23:30.666
-Nooky nice?
-Awesome.

372
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.041
How many times… you know?

373
00:23:33.125 --> 00:23:34.208
I don't.

374
00:23:34.291 --> 00:23:35.791
Give it more thought.

375
00:23:36.375 --> 00:23:38.333
How many times did he make you come?

376
00:23:40.291 --> 00:23:42.541
I don't know. A few?

377
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.125
Fuck. Never!

378
00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:47.458
I love her. Darek.

379
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:51.750
Me. I love pepperoni pizza.

380
00:23:51.833 --> 00:23:55.125
How do I know?
Because I tried different varieties.

381
00:23:56.416 --> 00:23:57.250
Hawaiian…

382
00:23:59.125 --> 00:24:00.583
Or capricciosa.

383
00:24:00.666 --> 00:24:02.458
Which is kind of boring.

384
00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:04.208
There's pizza with tuna.

385
00:24:04.291 --> 00:24:05.208
Or vegetarian.

386
00:24:06.375 --> 00:24:07.750
Quattro formaggi.

387
00:24:07.833 --> 00:24:11.083
You've tried one.
the first one to come along.

388
00:24:11.166 --> 00:24:13.666
One bite and you go. "Wow. amazing!"

389
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.250
Dump his ass. girl. Go fuck an athlete.

390
00:24:16.333 --> 00:24:18.500
How can you say that? He's your brother!

391
00:24:18.583 --> 00:24:21.208
So? Are you gonna get married?
To fill the void?

392
00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:23.875
You have one baby. then another.

393
00:24:23.958 --> 00:24:26.041
because two are easier to bring up.

394
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:30.166
He works constantly
to earn money for both your problems.

395
00:24:30.833 --> 00:24:35.625
You realize that asshole
can't fill the void you feel.

396
00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:37.666
So you whack him with an ax.

397
00:24:38.375 --> 00:24:39.625
See?

398
00:24:39.708 --> 00:24:41.000
I'm looking out for him.

399
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.375
Aren't you full of that pizza?

400
00:24:44.958 --> 00:24:47.000
-What?
-You're almost 30!

401
00:24:47.083 --> 00:24:49.166
Chasing teens on New Year's Eve?

402
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.875
Cut the crap.

403
00:24:50.958 --> 00:24:52.958
Get your shit together. Settle down.

404
00:24:53.041 --> 00:24:56.333
Jesus. dude. It doesn't work that way.

405
00:24:56.416 --> 00:25:00.000
"I wanna marry me a woman.
let me have one now."

406
00:25:00.083 --> 00:25:03.166
There's still time.
Why am I wasting my breath?

407
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.458
Where's your chick?

408
00:25:08.083 --> 00:25:10.541
-The blonde.
-Where?

409
00:25:11.916 --> 00:25:13.166
Daniel!

410
00:25:14.083 --> 00:25:17.708
Damn. pizza margherita!

411
00:25:17.791 --> 00:25:19.750
Now I get it.

412
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.875
And the other one?
The one talking to her?

413
00:25:23.958 --> 00:25:26.250
-Who is that?
-That is my sister.

414
00:25:26.333 --> 00:25:28.458
You have a sister? No way.

415
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.041
The one with the reindeer?

416
00:25:46.541 --> 00:25:48.000
Hey. have you seen Gloria?

417
00:25:48.916 --> 00:25:50.083
-Who?
-Gloria.

418
00:25:50.166 --> 00:25:51.416
An older lady.

419
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.916
Gloria. Gloria…

420
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.375
Gloria. yes.

421
00:25:54.458 --> 00:25:56.666
Yeah. of course!

422
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.166
Where?

423
00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.458
Everywhere!

424
00:26:00.708 --> 00:26:01.666
Everywhere.

425
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.791
So?

426
00:26:10.625 --> 00:26:13.333
-Think your friend's gonna deliver?
-Rafał?

427
00:26:13.416 --> 00:26:15.875
Yeah. for sure.

428
00:26:15.958 --> 00:26:18.541
You can count on him. He's a solid guy.

429
00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:25.166
Did you get it?

430
00:26:27.625 --> 00:26:28.625
I did.

431
00:26:28.708 --> 00:26:31.166
Damn. you're good!

432
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.500
-Here.
-Great!

433
00:26:32.583 --> 00:26:36.750
What an express courier. too!

434
00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:44.208
-What a nice surprise!
-Be sure to give it back.

435
00:26:45.416 --> 00:26:46.750
Please…

436
00:26:46.833 --> 00:26:48.333
OK!

437
00:26:50.583 --> 00:26:52.083
Where did you get it?

438
00:26:52.166 --> 00:26:55.291
It's calcium.
Found it in the kitchen and ground it.

439
00:26:55.375 --> 00:26:56.541
What the fuck?

440
00:26:56.625 --> 00:27:00.083
-I told you to get some real shit!
-Do I look like Pablo Escobar?

441
00:27:04.791 --> 00:27:05.666
Whoa!

442
00:27:07.083 --> 00:27:08.708
My. how I missed that.

443
00:27:10.375 --> 00:27:12.375
I haven't done this since…

444
00:27:13.458 --> 00:27:15.166
1995?

445
00:27:15.833 --> 00:27:17.083
My God.

446
00:27:17.166 --> 00:27:20.791
It's just that… it used to hit me
in a different way.

447
00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:27.583
OK.

448
00:27:27.666 --> 00:27:29.458
My sweet boys!

449
00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:34.166
What would you like to do with me then?

450
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:35.416
Well…

451
00:27:37.125 --> 00:27:38.083
Yeah?

452
00:27:39.875 --> 00:27:41.541
We'd like to…

453
00:27:42.583 --> 00:27:43.833
have some sex.

454
00:27:43.916 --> 00:27:46.291
Whoa. hold your horses!

455
00:27:47.416 --> 00:27:48.708
What's your name again?

456
00:27:49.375 --> 00:27:50.250
Rafał.

457
00:27:50.333 --> 00:27:52.250
Rafał.

458
00:27:52.916 --> 00:27:54.458
Rafałek.

459
00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:56.416
What would you like to do to me?

460
00:27:56.958 --> 00:27:58.583
Well…

461
00:28:00.166 --> 00:28:01.458
Mad positions.

462
00:28:02.125 --> 00:28:04.000
Awesome. Which ones?

463
00:28:05.958 --> 00:28:07.000
From behind.

464
00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:08.666
My favorite!

465
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:10.250
OK. Demonstrate how. please.

466
00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:16.750
No. love. Demonstrate on him.

467
00:28:16.833 --> 00:28:17.875
What?

468
00:28:17.958 --> 00:28:20.458
Just show me what you would do to me.

469
00:28:20.541 --> 00:28:21.625
Except on him.

470
00:28:22.166 --> 00:28:23.625
-How?
-Just show me.

471
00:28:23.708 --> 00:28:25.583
What the fuck? What are you doing?

472
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:27.500
Hang on a second.

473
00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:29.541
-We do no such things.
-Come on. boys!

474
00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:31.583
Hang on. we do no such things!

475
00:28:31.666 --> 00:28:33.208
It's just between us. right?

476
00:28:33.291 --> 00:28:36.083
I've seen those movies.
It always ends up badly.

477
00:28:36.166 --> 00:28:38.541
-What's your favorite position?
-Mine?

478
00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:41.875
The one where he's not touching me.
That one's awesome.

479
00:28:41.958 --> 00:28:43.000
OK.

480
00:28:43.958 --> 00:28:46.125
But…

481
00:28:49.125 --> 00:28:50.375
No pressure.

482
00:28:50.458 --> 00:28:51.625
No. wait!

483
00:29:04.083 --> 00:29:05.666
I see that…

484
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.541
you're quite handy with that.

485
00:29:08.625 --> 00:29:10.375
You're a real pro.

486
00:29:10.458 --> 00:29:12.750
So… You're a photographer?

487
00:29:13.875 --> 00:29:18.916
Not quite. It's more of a hobby. really.
A distraction.

488
00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:21.291
Distraction from what?

489
00:29:21.916 --> 00:29:23.791
From reality. I guess.

490
00:29:23.875 --> 00:29:26.708
Did you take any good photos today?

491
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.666
I did.

492
00:29:30.166 --> 00:29:31.916
-Show me.
-No.

493
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.166
-Come on. show me.
-No.

494
00:29:33.958 --> 00:29:38.666
They need some final touches.
Red eye removal. things like that.

495
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.958
Are you trying to hide something from me?

496
00:29:41.041 --> 00:29:42.250
No. why?

497
00:29:43.291 --> 00:29:44.375
Are you sure?

498
00:29:44.458 --> 00:29:45.916
Yes. I'm sure.

499
00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:49.208
OK. let me take a guess here.

500
00:29:56.375 --> 00:29:57.750
You…

501
00:29:58.916 --> 00:30:00.000
are…

502
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.041
a Libra.

503
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.416
Libra. yeah.

504
00:30:05.708 --> 00:30:07.916
-Nice. A lucky guess.
-Lucky guess?

505
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.541
How else would you know?

506
00:30:09.625 --> 00:30:12.208
No. no. I can read people.

507
00:30:12.291 --> 00:30:13.708
And I read you. too.

508
00:30:13.791 --> 00:30:16.125
You're hiding a lot under your hard shell.

509
00:30:16.708 --> 00:30:19.083
You're still young.
But you've gone through…

510
00:30:19.666 --> 00:30:20.875
some…

511
00:30:20.958 --> 00:30:22.250
relationship.

512
00:30:22.791 --> 00:30:24.791
A rough relationship.

513
00:30:24.875 --> 00:30:28.541
Which cut you so deep
that you still haven't gotten over it.

514
00:30:29.583 --> 00:30:32.250
So you're suffering.
Not because of a girl.

515
00:30:32.875 --> 00:30:34.541
but because of a relationship…

516
00:30:35.125 --> 00:30:36.250
with your parents.

517
00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:41.875
So… you've been distancing yourself
from the reality

518
00:30:41.958 --> 00:30:44.166
and you've had enough. How am I doing?

519
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:48.125
Not bad. I'm impressed.
But it's difficult.

520
00:30:48.958 --> 00:30:50.875
See. I told you. I have a gift!

521
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.125
OK. my turn.

522
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.500
Give me your hand. A rectangular palm…

523
00:30:57.583 --> 00:30:59.583
with short. slender fingers.

524
00:30:59.666 --> 00:31:01.125
OK.

525
00:31:01.708 --> 00:31:05.750
This is a hand
typical of someone who is fire.

526
00:31:05.833 --> 00:31:10.541
Who is fiercely individualist.
A quick-tempered individualist.

527
00:31:10.625 --> 00:31:15.166
Perhaps a little impatient.
Perhaps a little intolerant.

528
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.500
-Oh. boy.
-What?

529
00:31:20.375 --> 00:31:22.083
You have a broken life line.

530
00:31:22.875 --> 00:31:28.000
So you also had an experience
that impacted your life choices.

531
00:31:28.791 --> 00:31:31.291
And the two X's here… See?

532
00:31:32.416 --> 00:31:36.916
They indicate you may have experienced
a personal betrayal.

533
00:31:39.125 --> 00:31:41.208
And you are an Aquarius.

534
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.291
How did you know all this?

535
00:31:47.958 --> 00:31:49.166
I have a gift.

536
00:31:50.291 --> 00:31:53.000
You know what they say?

537
00:31:53.583 --> 00:31:54.916
Aquarius and Libra…

538
00:31:55.583 --> 00:31:57.500
tend to feel very free

539
00:31:57.583 --> 00:32:00.583
in expressing their sexual desires.

540
00:32:00.666 --> 00:32:02.916
-Is that so?
-Um-hum. It's a shame.

541
00:32:04.166 --> 00:32:07.125
Who knows what could happen
in a parallel universe.

542
00:32:07.208 --> 00:32:08.833
where we are both single.

543
00:32:10.666 --> 00:32:11.875
Are you ready?

544
00:32:11.958 --> 00:32:13.041
Yes.

545
00:32:14.416 --> 00:32:15.625
For what?

546
00:32:16.916 --> 00:32:18.291
For lighting up!

547
00:32:21.875 --> 00:32:24.458
-What are you looking for?
-I forgot a lighter.

548
00:32:24.541 --> 00:32:26.000
Well. maybe it's a sign?

549
00:32:27.333 --> 00:32:29.416
That we shouldn't smoke.

550
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.541
-Do the honors.
-You go first.

551
00:32:33.625 --> 00:32:35.041
Come on. you'll loosen up.

552
00:32:35.125 --> 00:32:36.875
I'm already loose. really.

553
00:32:36.958 --> 00:32:38.500
I see how tense you are.

554
00:32:49.583 --> 00:32:50.666
Hold this.

555
00:32:52.208 --> 00:32:53.666
What's this?

556
00:32:57.583 --> 00:32:59.166
Some kind of key.

557
00:33:02.083 --> 00:33:03.250
Step aside.

558
00:33:19.958 --> 00:33:21.500
Oh. fuck.

559
00:33:27.166 --> 00:33:28.666
What are you doing?

560
00:33:29.875 --> 00:33:31.416
Stop pointing at me.

561
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.625
Don't do that. I don't like it.

562
00:33:34.458 --> 00:33:36.250
-Come on.
-This is awesome!

563
00:33:36.333 --> 00:33:38.000
I've always wanted to shoot.

564
00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:41.666
You don't even know how to hold it.
Do you want me to show you?

565
00:33:43.208 --> 00:33:45.166
How come you're a gun expert?

566
00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.166
My dad showed me the ropes.

567
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:50.333
And I always wanted to learn.
What a coincidence!

568
00:33:50.416 --> 00:33:52.916
Perhaps it isn't a coincidence.

569
00:33:55.916 --> 00:33:58.625
Aim there. At that snowman. Seems safe.

570
00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:00.875
So you prefer safe?

571
00:34:01.416 --> 00:34:03.083
Not always.

572
00:34:03.625 --> 00:34:05.083
Shoulders straight.

573
00:34:05.166 --> 00:34:07.250
-Like this?
-Yes.

574
00:34:07.875 --> 00:34:09.958
Feet at your shoulders' width.

575
00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:11.250
Like this?

576
00:34:12.166 --> 00:34:13.666
Mm-hmm.

577
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:16.666
Here you can relax…

578
00:34:17.958 --> 00:34:19.000
Yes.

579
00:34:19.666 --> 00:34:21.958
Now cock the gun.

580
00:34:25.125 --> 00:34:26.958
And now…

581
00:34:28.208 --> 00:34:30.750
Release the trigger.

582
00:34:41.166 --> 00:34:42.625
Very nice.

583
00:34:42.708 --> 00:34:44.708
You got it. Rafał!

584
00:34:44.791 --> 00:34:46.375
-Slap him on the ass.
-What?

585
00:34:46.458 --> 00:34:47.666
Slap him!

586
00:34:48.208 --> 00:34:50.291
Harder! Oh. yeah!

587
00:34:50.375 --> 00:34:51.708
Grab his hair.

588
00:35:06.416 --> 00:35:07.875
Yes!

589
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.125
Yes. Filip! It's what the universe wanted!

590
00:35:29.041 --> 00:35:30.125
Sorry.

591
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:34.625
What was that?

592
00:35:34.708 --> 00:35:35.791
Great. Rafał!

593
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.625
OK. keep doing it. come on!

594
00:35:40.708 --> 00:35:42.000
What was that?

595
00:35:43.916 --> 00:35:44.958
What are you doing?

596
00:35:45.041 --> 00:35:46.250
-Recording?
-No. no…

597
00:35:46.333 --> 00:35:47.916
-Delete it!
-It's for you!

598
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.208
Of course I'll delete it!
Jesus. OK. it's off.

599
00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:53.583
Continue.

600
00:35:56.291 --> 00:35:59.500
Angelica. you are the best thing
that ever happened to me.

601
00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:03.125
When I met you…

602
00:36:03.916 --> 00:36:07.208
my world turned 180 degrees.

603
00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:09.041
It changed forever.

604
00:36:10.916 --> 00:36:13.125
You're the best thing…
Already said that…

605
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:15.333
…I love you.

606
00:36:21.708 --> 00:36:23.458
Hello? Yes. Mom?

607
00:36:24.041 --> 00:36:26.833
What do you mean you're hungry?
I made you sandwiches.

608
00:36:28.041 --> 00:36:29.916
Okay. Open the corner shelf.

609
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.583
You'll find a deep green pot.

610
00:36:33.666 --> 00:36:36.291
Take that. and drop pierogis in.

611
00:36:37.166 --> 00:36:38.500
-Driver 4. come in.
-Fuck!

612
00:36:38.583 --> 00:36:41.333
-Where are you?
-Not you. Mom. Sorry.

613
00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:52.791
Ah. screw it.

614
00:36:56.208 --> 00:36:58.208
Please. girls. put this on. will you?

615
00:36:58.291 --> 00:37:03.041
Come on. this will blow you away.
It's gonna be a hit with a capital H!

616
00:37:03.125 --> 00:37:04.416
No way.

617
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.750
You won't regret it. you'll see.

618
00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:09.625
Fuck. here we go again.
She drinks. then disappears!

619
00:37:09.708 --> 00:37:12.000
Your chick ran away
into someone else's arms?

620
00:37:12.083 --> 00:37:15.791
That could never happen to me.
Anastasia knows her place.

621
00:37:24.666 --> 00:37:25.791
What happened?

622
00:37:26.458 --> 00:37:27.500
Fuck.

623
00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:30.291
Anastasia!

624
00:37:30.958 --> 00:37:32.541
Oh. no.

625
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.541
Oh. fuck… Marek!

626
00:37:49.791 --> 00:37:52.416
Oh. fuck.

627
00:37:53.208 --> 00:37:55.541
Oh. no.

628
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.208
OK.

629
00:38:08.708 --> 00:38:11.333
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere!

630
00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:16.666
-Hey!
-Hi!

631
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:19.083
Did you hear that bang?
What was that?

632
00:38:19.166 --> 00:38:22.916
What bang? No. I heard nothing.
Maybe the Germans are coming?

633
00:38:25.291 --> 00:38:26.750
What happened here. man?

634
00:38:26.833 --> 00:38:29.125
Nothing.

635
00:38:29.208 --> 00:38:30.791
Is he dead?

636
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Yes. he's dead drunk!

637
00:38:35.583 --> 00:38:37.125
And now he's resting!

638
00:38:37.208 --> 00:38:38.958
God. all this blood…

639
00:38:39.041 --> 00:38:40.875
Is this blood?

640
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
It's ketchup.

641
00:38:44.083 --> 00:38:45.791
This makes no sense.

642
00:38:45.875 --> 00:38:48.791
What do you mean. no sense?

643
00:38:48.875 --> 00:38:50.208
Ketchup.

644
00:38:50.791 --> 00:38:52.625
Pizza… Wine.

645
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:54.166
Vodka.

646
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.458
And that's how it ends. Right. Marek?

647
00:38:56.541 --> 00:38:59.833
Come. buddy. Let's lie down.
You'll sleep it off.

648
00:38:59.916 --> 00:39:02.791
-Anastasia. come along. will you?
-I'm a killer.

649
00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:04.916
I'm a killer.

650
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.416
Shouldn't we call an ambulance?

651
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.041
No! He just needs to rest.

652
00:39:11.125 --> 00:39:13.750
In eternal peace. Amen.

653
00:39:13.833 --> 00:39:15.958
You two have a sick sense of humor.

654
00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:17.708
Hey. girl! Are you OK?

655
00:39:17.791 --> 00:39:20.250
-Everything's A-OK.
-What happened?

656
00:39:20.333 --> 00:39:23.250
We're just playing a game.

657
00:39:23.333 --> 00:39:25.000
Jackson Pollock! Holy fuck.

658
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.083
The fuck's wrong with you?

659
00:39:34.375 --> 00:39:35.875
Do you wanna go to prison?

660
00:39:36.833 --> 00:39:39.458
No. no. There has to be an explanation.

661
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:43.416
Yes! We just experienced
a moment of karmic connection.

662
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.416
This was all meant to happen.

663
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.625
This is no joke! We have
a real fucking problem to deal with!

664
00:39:48.708 --> 00:39:52.166
What problem exactly?
This is what the universe wanted.

665
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.666
A test of strength
of our potential relationship.

666
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:55.708
Come on!

667
00:39:57.208 --> 00:39:59.333
Let's… let's retrace our steps.

668
00:39:59.416 --> 00:40:00.833
You invited me upstairs.

669
00:40:00.916 --> 00:40:03.041
-No!
-You took a gazillion pics of me.

670
00:40:03.125 --> 00:40:06.750
Filip. that was no art. It was foreplay.

671
00:40:06.833 --> 00:40:11.208
Anastasia! Wake up! The position of
Mercury has nothing to do with it!

672
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:14.666
Neither does the angle of Betelgeuse
to the constellation Aquila.

673
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.541
nor any other cosmological shit!

674
00:40:17.166 --> 00:40:18.833
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah!

675
00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:22.916
And when you read my palm.
divining my life? What was that?

676
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.125
Energy. We exchanged vibrations.

677
00:40:26.208 --> 00:40:27.833
-It makes sense!
-It was him.

678
00:40:27.916 --> 00:40:30.083
He told me about you.
How you feel neglected.

679
00:40:30.166 --> 00:40:33.083
How Jordan only thinks of his
rapper's career. ignoring you.

680
00:40:33.166 --> 00:40:35.125
How cosmic and great you are.

681
00:40:35.208 --> 00:40:37.708
So I used those things.
I just spiced them up.

682
00:40:37.791 --> 00:40:40.333
With horoscope shit
which could apply to anyone.

683
00:40:40.416 --> 00:40:45.958
That's it. It was all bullshit.
Got it? Just bullshit!

684
00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:47.083
Aquarius!

685
00:40:47.166 --> 00:40:49.041
How did you know I was Aquarius?

686
00:40:49.125 --> 00:40:52.041
Fuck if I know! I just guessed.

687
00:40:52.125 --> 00:40:54.125
Plus. my mother's an Aquarius. too.

688
00:40:54.208 --> 00:40:56.541
And you know what?
You remind me of her.

689
00:40:56.625 --> 00:40:58.500
You're the same kind of whack!

690
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.208
Liar. You're a liar.

691
00:41:02.291 --> 00:41:04.625
I'm sorry. I just wanted to fuck you.

692
00:41:12.333 --> 00:41:15.208
You dickhead! How could you?!

693
00:41:15.291 --> 00:41:19.125
Why would the universe trick me so?
I saw all the signs around me!

694
00:41:19.208 --> 00:41:21.833
-Calm down!
-Let go of me!

695
00:41:21.916 --> 00:41:22.916
Gloria!

696
00:41:24.791 --> 00:41:28.625
Have we got a treat for you. honey!

697
00:41:28.708 --> 00:41:29.958
PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS

698
00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:32.083
Nom. nom. nom!

699
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:35.833
TWO LITERS OF VODKA

700
00:41:35.916 --> 00:41:37.541
More. Jola. give him more!

701
00:41:38.625 --> 00:41:41.916
Come here! Come. sweetie pie!

702
00:41:42.875 --> 00:41:45.125
It's really nice of you.
but I have to say no.

703
00:41:45.833 --> 00:41:50.500
The prophets
condemned extramarital sex as sinful…

704
00:41:54.458 --> 00:41:56.333
Jesus. Mary and Joseph!

705
00:41:56.416 --> 00:41:57.416
OK. I'll go first!

706
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.500
Quiet. Keep quiet! Maybe you're right
and all this happened for a reason.

707
00:42:02.583 --> 00:42:05.250
-Some good may happen yet.
-You won't trick me again.

708
00:42:05.333 --> 00:42:07.875
You're saying that
'cause you think I'm crazy!

709
00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:09.208
No. think about it.

710
00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:12.041
Maybe in a parallel universe
nothing went wrong.

711
00:42:12.125 --> 00:42:13.083
What?

712
00:42:13.166 --> 00:42:17.500
Maybe in there we're still in that office.
smoking the joint. you're laughing at me.

713
00:42:17.583 --> 00:42:18.833
I'm laughing. too.

714
00:42:18.916 --> 00:42:21.916
Maybe Marek's still alive.
the party's going on. all is OK.

715
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.791
And this situation? Look.

716
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:28.666
This is just the darkest scenario.
clearly hypothetical.

717
00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.458
Do you see?

718
00:42:31.125 --> 00:42:32.458
You're insane!

719
00:42:33.458 --> 00:42:35.666
I'm insane? It's you who's wacko!

720
00:42:39.041 --> 00:42:41.791
Oh. hi Marek!

721
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.958
Well. hello!

722
00:42:47.916 --> 00:42:49.458
I need to tell Jordan.

723
00:42:49.541 --> 00:42:51.541
No. don't! You don't need to!

724
00:42:54.625 --> 00:42:56.333
Fuck.

725
00:42:59.583 --> 00:43:01.541
He's got no hard-on.

726
00:43:01.625 --> 00:43:03.291
Perhaps he's gay!

727
00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:07.208
Well. hello!

728
00:43:07.291 --> 00:43:09.333
-Freeze!
-Don't!

729
00:43:09.416 --> 00:43:10.625
Motherfucker.

730
00:43:11.416 --> 00:43:13.500
-Good day.
-Take this off.

731
00:43:13.583 --> 00:43:15.583
No. no… Fine. OK.

732
00:43:15.666 --> 00:43:16.916
Oh yeah!

733
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.958
We're not just playing around here!
On the bed with him!

734
00:43:20.041 --> 00:43:21.125
I call dibs!

735
00:43:21.208 --> 00:43:22.750
No dibs. Jola! He's mine!

736
00:43:33.416 --> 00:43:36.166
Driver 4. where are you?

737
00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:37.291
Fuck!

738
00:43:37.375 --> 00:43:39.625
We have a zillion orders here for you.

739
00:43:39.708 --> 00:43:42.000
Driver 4. come in. you moron.

740
00:43:43.416 --> 00:43:45.625
Driver 4. where the fuck are you?

741
00:43:54.333 --> 00:43:56.583
Jordan!

742
00:44:10.166 --> 00:44:13.708
Say. have you seen the guy
who's paying for the pizzas?

743
00:44:16.416 --> 00:44:19.958
Excuse me. have you seen the guy
who's paying for the pizzas?

744
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.208
Excuse me!

745
00:44:26.125 --> 00:44:28.958
Have you seen the guy
who's paying me for the pizzas?

746
00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:31.541
Your hair is so soft!

747
00:44:31.625 --> 00:44:33.125
Like silk.

748
00:44:34.083 --> 00:44:35.083
No!

749
00:44:35.958 --> 00:44:37.750
Like teddy bears.

750
00:44:37.833 --> 00:44:39.125
Listen!

751
00:44:39.208 --> 00:44:41.708
Where's the guy paying for the pizzas?

752
00:44:46.625 --> 00:44:50.166
You should really drink
lots of water if you're gonna take this.

753
00:44:50.958 --> 00:44:52.333
CO?

754
00:44:52.416 --> 00:44:53.666
No. HO.

755
00:44:58.541 --> 00:45:00.416
Look. I'm not kidding.

756
00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.083
If you take ecstasy.
you should drink tons of water.

757
00:45:03.166 --> 00:45:07.458
In a place this hot. your body temperature
will increase over the danger limit.

758
00:45:07.541 --> 00:45:11.041
Combined with vigorous alcohol intake.
your blood pressure will drop

759
00:45:11.125 --> 00:45:13.708
and your heart rate will accelerate.

760
00:45:13.791 --> 00:45:17.041
Which can then cause
permanent damage to your brain.

761
00:45:17.916 --> 00:45:19.625
Do you understand?

762
00:45:22.125 --> 00:45:23.416
Are you drinking this?

763
00:45:26.125 --> 00:45:27.750
Here. drink it all up!

764
00:45:37.875 --> 00:45:39.458
I think I'm burning!

765
00:45:40.541 --> 00:45:41.708
Well. I warned you.

766
00:45:41.791 --> 00:45:43.708
-Come on.
-Not now!

767
00:45:43.791 --> 00:45:47.291
They're playing my song! Anastasia!

768
00:45:57.208 --> 00:45:59.083
Hey. sis. Are you baking a cake?

769
00:45:59.166 --> 00:46:02.083
No. This is something different.

770
00:46:02.166 --> 00:46:06.000
I cuffed that friend of yours to the bed.

771
00:46:06.083 --> 00:46:09.125
Now I'm gonna rub some
whipped cream on him.

772
00:46:09.208 --> 00:46:11.916
Then I'll shove a banana right up his…

773
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.458
Alright. stop! Too much information.

774
00:46:14.541 --> 00:46:17.333
You should also try
something new for a change.

775
00:46:17.416 --> 00:46:18.708
Am I right. Angela?

776
00:46:19.708 --> 00:46:20.750
Right about what?

777
00:46:20.833 --> 00:46:24.125
The way he could introduce some kink
into your master bedroom.

778
00:46:24.208 --> 00:46:26.291
I mean. your bunk-bed dorm room.

779
00:46:26.375 --> 00:46:30.166
Bang her in a dangerous location.
Like a cemetery.

780
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:33.083
Hey. sis! Our sex life
is none of your biz.

781
00:46:33.166 --> 00:46:35.208
Just trying to lend a helping hand.

782
00:46:35.291 --> 00:46:37.291
Forget it. Who knows where it's been.

783
00:46:37.375 --> 00:46:40.500
Whatever. See ya! Losers!

784
00:46:43.791 --> 00:46:45.166
Are you all right?

785
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.958
I just need some fresh air.

786
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:49.791
OK.

787
00:47:03.291 --> 00:47:04.541
Hi.

788
00:47:04.625 --> 00:47:07.000
Hello again!

789
00:47:07.083 --> 00:47:08.125
Hey.

790
00:47:09.833 --> 00:47:14.208
What kind of game
are you two playing. really?

791
00:47:14.291 --> 00:47:16.458
You don't wanna know.

792
00:47:16.541 --> 00:47:17.791
Perhaps I'd like to.

793
00:47:18.916 --> 00:47:20.291
Or perhaps you'd like to…

794
00:47:20.375 --> 00:47:22.500
-What?
-Join me?

795
00:47:22.583 --> 00:47:24.500
In a threesome? Huh?

796
00:47:28.625 --> 00:47:31.208
Shit. this is kind of bad timing.

797
00:47:32.958 --> 00:47:35.291
Who else do you have in there?

798
00:47:35.375 --> 00:47:36.250
What?

799
00:47:36.333 --> 00:47:38.958
Maybe I should be joining you?

800
00:47:48.125 --> 00:47:50.500
Mōribus!

801
00:47:55.333 --> 00:47:57.125
Hey…

802
00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.666
-What are you doing. son?
-Jesus?

803
00:48:06.375 --> 00:48:07.791
Why have you forsaken me?

804
00:48:07.875 --> 00:48:09.416
Just one moment!

805
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.541
God made men and women sexual creatures.
How can sex be prohibited?

806
00:48:13.625 --> 00:48:17.458
What about the idea of chastity
in word. thought and deed?

807
00:48:17.541 --> 00:48:20.041
But I hear only one thing in my head.

808
00:48:20.125 --> 00:48:21.875
"Fuck her!"

809
00:48:24.666 --> 00:48:27.291
Come on. let me see.

810
00:48:27.375 --> 00:48:30.916
-What are you doing?
-What? Let's dance. Come on.

811
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.583
What is it? Foreplay?

812
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:38.333
I cannot give you my blessing

813
00:48:38.416 --> 00:48:41.625
for all the things you desire to do here.

814
00:48:41.708 --> 00:48:43.458
But I cannot forbid them. either.

815
00:48:43.541 --> 00:48:45.583
I am certain you will choose aptly.

816
00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.583
Where's Marek?

817
00:49:04.416 --> 00:49:05.791
Marek…

818
00:49:08.041 --> 00:49:09.291
Gross.

819
00:49:09.916 --> 00:49:11.541
The fuck are you doing?

820
00:49:13.833 --> 00:49:15.291
Are you fucking nuts?!

821
00:49:16.333 --> 00:49:18.875
-Let me out of here!
-We didn't mean to!

822
00:49:18.958 --> 00:49:20.666
-You killed Marek!
-Accidentally!

823
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:22.750
Let me out. you idiot!

824
00:49:22.833 --> 00:49:24.541
-Fuck!
-Keep quiet!

825
00:49:24.625 --> 00:49:26.416
Shut up!

826
00:49:27.833 --> 00:49:28.875
Hey. girls!

827
00:49:28.958 --> 00:49:31.000
-Well. hello!
-Have you seen the guy…

828
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:33.875
who ordered the pizzas?

829
00:49:34.958 --> 00:49:37.958
Hush! Quiet!

830
00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:40.625
…and if I'm an hour late.
all the pizzas are free.

831
00:49:40.708 --> 00:49:42.875
Then my boss is sure going to fire me.

832
00:49:42.958 --> 00:49:46.583
and I'm screwed because I can't afford
my neuropharmacology tuition.

833
00:49:47.125 --> 00:49:48.416
Neuro… what?

834
00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.208
Fafalogy.

835
00:49:50.833 --> 00:49:53.750
It's just that I won't be able to
keep helping my mom.

836
00:49:53.833 --> 00:49:56.708
And I can't go another year
wiping her ass!

837
00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.833
He loves his mommy!

838
00:49:59.916 --> 00:50:02.958
Relax. pizza face. Marek's in there.

839
00:50:03.958 --> 00:50:05.541
-In there?
-Um-hum.

840
00:50:05.625 --> 00:50:07.083
Thanks. girls.

841
00:50:08.083 --> 00:50:11.625
-Mr. Malinowski? What's up?
-What's happening in your apartment?

842
00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:14.875
The janitor called about
smoke coming out your windows!

843
00:50:14.958 --> 00:50:17.333
It's nothing. sir.
I just burned some toast.

844
00:50:17.416 --> 00:50:19.125
Everything's under control.

845
00:50:19.208 --> 00:50:23.416
Hello. Jessica here.
I'll polish your tool for just ten zloty.

846
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.750
Fucking hell! Hello? What tool?

847
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:33.041
Keep quiet!

848
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:37.916
What the fuck's going on?!

849
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.458
Hey!

850
00:50:40.416 --> 00:50:43.458
Oliwia? What's with you?!

851
00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:45.250
-Girls. please.
-Jesus?

852
00:50:47.125 --> 00:50:49.375
He's gonna puke on all of us!

853
00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:51.708
Wait up!

854
00:50:55.083 --> 00:50:56.791
Hey!

855
00:50:56.875 --> 00:51:01.500
Who do we have here?

856
00:51:04.041 --> 00:51:05.083
Hello?

857
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.208
Jesus?

858
00:51:10.458 --> 00:51:11.500
I don't know.

859
00:51:14.375 --> 00:51:15.250
Jesus?

860
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:19.125
What can I do?

861
00:51:20.375 --> 00:51:22.125
What can I do? Tell me!

862
00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:27.958
How does this work?

863
00:51:28.041 --> 00:51:29.000
Jesus?

864
00:51:38.833 --> 00:51:40.416
Fucking hell.

865
00:51:41.916 --> 00:51:42.958
Jesus?

866
00:51:56.791 --> 00:51:59.833
Jesus?

867
00:52:01.666 --> 00:52:04.833
Oh. here you are.

868
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.458
Mom. why is there smoke in our house?

869
00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:10.458
I did everything you told me.

870
00:52:10.541 --> 00:52:13.125
I put pierogi in the pot
and turned on the stove.

871
00:52:13.208 --> 00:52:14.750
But now there's a huge fire!

872
00:52:14.833 --> 00:52:16.458
Throw some water on it!

873
00:52:16.541 --> 00:52:19.916
Never mind. get out of there!
Do you hear me?

874
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.166
Hello! Mom?

875
00:52:22.375 --> 00:52:24.083
Shit! Mom!

876
00:52:24.833 --> 00:52:25.833
Shit.

877
00:52:27.875 --> 00:52:29.125
Marek. sir?

878
00:52:30.666 --> 00:52:32.333
Marek. sir. is everything OK?

879
00:52:40.125 --> 00:52:41.583
Oh. fuck.

880
00:52:57.916 --> 00:52:59.083
Holy shit.

881
00:53:09.458 --> 00:53:11.083
Have you seen a guitar anywhere?

882
00:53:16.166 --> 00:53:17.375
It's over there.

883
00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:57.375
Fuck!

884
00:54:03.333 --> 00:54:04.625
Driver 4. where are you?

885
00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:08.250
Would Your Highness bless us
with your presence here?

886
00:54:10.125 --> 00:54:14.041
-I've got the money. I'm on my way.
-No need to rush.

887
00:54:23.416 --> 00:54:24.375
Gloria?

888
00:54:24.458 --> 00:54:26.125
It's not what it looks like.

889
00:54:26.208 --> 00:54:27.541
What's going on here?

890
00:54:27.625 --> 00:54:29.083
-Nothing!
-She made us do it!

891
00:54:29.166 --> 00:54:30.333
Hey. babe!

892
00:54:30.416 --> 00:54:32.666
Gloria! I'm dancing. looking for you.

893
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:34.416
while you fuck around with these?

894
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:35.375
You were dancing?

895
00:54:35.458 --> 00:54:37.500
-What?
-Come on. Let's go dancing. babe.

896
00:54:37.583 --> 00:54:40.416
-No. I just wanted to…
-Come on.

897
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.791
-Let's go. babe.
-Gloria! Hey!

898
00:54:42.875 --> 00:54:44.333
What was that about?

899
00:54:45.333 --> 00:54:46.958
Gloria. we need to talk!

900
00:55:04.166 --> 00:55:07.125
-Are you nuts?
-Don't be so uptight.

901
00:55:07.208 --> 00:55:10.875
Uptight? You're fucking other guys
behind my back!

902
00:55:10.958 --> 00:55:15.166
Pardon? I wasn't fucking anybody.
And if I did. why do you care?

903
00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:16.458
Why do I care?

904
00:55:16.541 --> 00:55:18.041
I care because we're dating.

905
00:55:18.125 --> 00:55:20.250
We're not dating.

906
00:55:20.333 --> 00:55:22.708
-What are we doing then?
-Dancing.

907
00:55:28.833 --> 00:55:30.166
Fuck this.

908
00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:32.041
We are dating because I love you.

909
00:55:32.125 --> 00:55:34.291
Don't say that. Paweł.

910
00:55:35.041 --> 00:55:37.250
Why? It's true. I love you.

911
00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:40.708
-Why can't you accept that?
-You're 17 years younger than me!

912
00:55:40.791 --> 00:55:43.375
So what? There are many such couples.

913
00:55:43.458 --> 00:55:45.708
Like Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore.

914
00:55:45.791 --> 00:55:47.208
And how did that end?

915
00:55:47.291 --> 00:55:49.750
Madonna and Guy Ritchie!
Jay-Z and Beyoncé!

916
00:55:49.833 --> 00:55:52.708
Or Princess Charlene of Monaco
and Prince Albert!

917
00:55:52.791 --> 00:55:55.625
-How do you even know about them all?
-I googled them.

918
00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:00.500
Jesus. Gloria. that's not the point.

919
00:56:00.583 --> 00:56:03.666
The point here is…
they all were. or have been. happy.

920
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:06.958
And I can make you happy too. honey.
because I love you.

921
00:56:07.041 --> 00:56:08.791
-For God's sake…
-I love you.

922
00:56:08.875 --> 00:56:10.541
He won't fucking let me dance!

923
00:56:12.125 --> 00:56:13.166
Where are you going?

924
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:15.583
Gloria!

925
00:56:15.666 --> 00:56:17.541
-Excuse me.
-You're just afraid.

926
00:56:17.625 --> 00:56:21.166
You're having some midlife crisis
bullshit and putting it on me!

927
00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:24.875
Do you really want me to tell you
what a 17-years age gap means?

928
00:56:25.458 --> 00:56:27.625
Now you think it's nice and fun.

929
00:56:27.708 --> 00:56:29.333
-You love being with a MILF.
-No!

930
00:56:29.416 --> 00:56:31.583
Oh yes! You had the best sex of your life.

931
00:56:31.666 --> 00:56:34.708
which you probably
wouldn't get from any girls your age.

932
00:56:34.791 --> 00:56:36.708
-And you take that for love.
-Not at all!

933
00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:40.416
-You like to brag about banging me.
-I don't. I respect you. I love you.

934
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.958
Yeah. yeah. Fuck!

935
00:56:44.166 --> 00:56:46.208
Do you want to have kids with me?

936
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:50.250
I do. I do want it.

937
00:56:50.333 --> 00:56:51.250
Wonderful.

938
00:56:51.333 --> 00:56:53.333
Then in nine months. if we're lucky.

939
00:56:53.416 --> 00:56:56.000
we'll have a son named. say…

940
00:56:56.083 --> 00:56:57.000
Krzyś…

941
00:56:57.083 --> 00:56:58.791
and we'll be one happy family.

942
00:56:58.875 --> 00:57:02.958
All-night baby changing. feeding. lulling.
But we'll make it. it'll be great.

943
00:57:03.041 --> 00:57:07.291
In eight years you'll be 30.
and I'll be past 50.

944
00:57:07.375 --> 00:57:11.208
My tits get saggy. I gain weight.
I get more wrinkly by the day.

945
00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:12.333
I go gray. ugly…

946
00:57:12.416 --> 00:57:14.500
I'm not attractive to you anymore.

947
00:57:15.166 --> 00:57:19.125
So you go and find some chick.
say. Kasia. to fuck on the side.

948
00:57:19.208 --> 00:57:21.916
You're out of home all the time.
Your kid misses you.

949
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.416
I'm covering for you to protect you.

950
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:28.291
Plus. I get depressed.
I'm not a sweet young mama anymore.

951
00:57:28.375 --> 00:57:29.916
We fight constantly.

952
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000
The kid can hear it and gets worried
that I'm hurting his dearest daddy.

953
00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:38.625
And to you. the vision of a new life
with Kasia seems much more attractive.

954
00:57:38.708 --> 00:57:41.541
So you leave me. Paweł!

955
00:57:41.625 --> 00:57:45.166
The kid wants to stay with you.
because he thinks I'm a bad mother.

956
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:47.916
I'll never forgive myself for it! Got it?

957
00:58:27.583 --> 00:58:29.041
To be great…

958
00:58:31.083 --> 00:58:32.583
is to go on.

959
00:58:34.833 --> 00:58:36.208
To go on…

960
00:58:36.791 --> 00:58:38.083
is to go far.

961
00:58:39.208 --> 00:58:40.541
To go far…

962
00:58:41.083 --> 00:58:42.625
is to be brave.

963
00:59:17.958 --> 00:59:19.500
Childish prick!

964
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:22.875
Just look at you!

965
00:59:22.958 --> 00:59:25.416
Aren't you painted nice?

966
00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:29.333
HELP ME! THESE TWO ARE MAD!
I'M GONNA CHOKE TO DEATH!

967
00:59:30.166 --> 00:59:33.375
-What is he saying?
-"I wanna fuck."

968
00:59:33.458 --> 00:59:34.708
Not "I'm gonna choke"?

969
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.333
Don't be ridiculous!

970
00:59:37.416 --> 00:59:38.458
I'M GONNA CHOKE!

971
00:59:39.041 --> 00:59:42.041
Patience! Give us a sec. lover boy.

972
00:59:42.125 --> 00:59:43.166
Let's use this.

973
00:59:44.083 --> 00:59:45.166
The right end up!

974
00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:46.791
WHAT?!

975
00:59:46.875 --> 00:59:48.333
Go a little up.

976
00:59:50.916 --> 00:59:54.125
Dear Father. forgive me for I have sinned.

977
00:59:54.208 --> 00:59:56.333
I lied to my bishop and went to a party.

978
00:59:56.416 --> 00:59:58.458
I had an amazing sex with two women.

979
00:59:58.541 --> 01:00:02.375
For over a decade
my virginity was my pride.

980
01:00:02.458 --> 01:00:06.166
But having sex is so awesome.
It should be cherished. not forbidden.

981
01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.958
I've chosen a new path.

982
01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:11.291
I'm going to celebrate sex from now on.

983
01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:13.916
I'm going to become a master of sex!

984
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.208
Please. Father. give me a sign.

985
01:00:22.125 --> 01:00:23.416
Come here.

986
01:02:29.166 --> 01:02:31.666
I followed all the signs
from the universe.

987
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:33.958
I listened to its calls and signals.

988
01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:36.666
I thought that the photos. the flirting.

989
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:39.125
the affinity of our souls
and our experiences…

990
01:02:39.208 --> 01:02:41.541
that two broken pieces made a whole!

991
01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:42.750
What does that mean?

992
01:02:42.833 --> 01:02:44.958
What if there are more pieces?

993
01:02:45.041 --> 01:02:48.250
Is Filip the likeness of sinful flesh?

994
01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:49.208
Who's Filip?

995
01:02:49.291 --> 01:02:53.541
All the blood…
All the sex. lies. and guns!

996
01:02:54.083 --> 01:02:56.875
I'm unworthy of the purity of my goddess.

997
01:02:56.958 --> 01:03:00.833
I bit into the forbidden fruit of
the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

998
01:03:00.916 --> 01:03:02.250
I was lured by deception!

999
01:03:02.333 --> 01:03:05.083
Anastasia! Can you tell me
what happened already?

1000
01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:10.125
I am a puppet.
and the devil is pulling my strings.

1001
01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:11.625
Dear God.

1002
01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:14.458
He's unleashed his fury upon me. you see?

1003
01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:15.500
Yeah. I see.

1004
01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:17.791
It's a penance for my infidelity.

1005
01:03:17.875 --> 01:03:21.041
-I'm living in Gomorrah!
-Gomorrah… Rha-rha-rha-rha…

1006
01:03:21.125 --> 01:03:24.375
I'm guided through the path
of indecent self awareness.

1007
01:03:24.458 --> 01:03:28.291
But no! In the end. the truth
will let the demons out. love.

1008
01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:31.583
No more blood of the innocents
shall be spilled by my hand!

1009
01:03:31.666 --> 01:03:33.750
I shouldn't have been unfaithful to you.

1010
01:03:33.833 --> 01:03:35.333
You shouldn't have been…

1011
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.416
You shouldn't have been what?
You did what?

1012
01:03:41.333 --> 01:03:42.500
What did you say?

1013
01:03:47.541 --> 01:03:50.083
Can I have your attention
for a moment. please?

1014
01:03:51.583 --> 01:03:54.916
I have something important to say
to a very special person.

1015
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.458
May I? Thanks.

1016
01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.833
Hey. turn up the bloody music!

1017
01:03:58.916 --> 01:04:01.291
It's not gonna take long.

1018
01:04:02.416 --> 01:04:04.958
The person I'd like to invite to join me

1019
01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:07.166
is my lovely girlfriend Angelica.

1020
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:08.583
Angelica!

1021
01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:14.750
Join me. please.

1022
01:04:18.916 --> 01:04:19.875
Angelica…

1023
01:04:19.958 --> 01:04:21.375
Daniel. let's talk first.

1024
01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:24.750
The first time I met you
almost a year ago.

1025
01:04:25.541 --> 01:04:27.041
you looked so beautiful.

1026
01:04:28.625 --> 01:04:31.041
I'd never believed in love at first sight

1027
01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:33.791
but I instantly knew you were the one

1028
01:04:33.875 --> 01:04:36.541
I wanted to live the rest of my life with.

1029
01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:38.750
I fell in love

1030
01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:40.250
with your eyes.

1031
01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:44.041
With the way you walk from room to room.

1032
01:04:44.125 --> 01:04:46.166
With how you look when you sleep.

1033
01:04:47.208 --> 01:04:49.791
When I look into your eyes.
I can see our future.

1034
01:04:49.875 --> 01:04:52.083
I can see us growing old together.

1035
01:04:52.166 --> 01:04:57.166
annoying each other for the next 50.
60. 70 years. perhaps even more.

1036
01:04:57.250 --> 01:05:01.291
Until your hair is gray.
my hair is gone and our teeth fall out.

1037
01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:04.000
When I look at you…

1038
01:05:04.875 --> 01:05:07.041
I can see a part of myself in you.

1039
01:05:07.125 --> 01:05:10.083
In that part of you
I don't ever want to let go.

1040
01:05:10.791 --> 01:05:12.041
I love you.

1041
01:05:13.958 --> 01:05:15.041
Angelica.

1042
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:16.708
my love--

1043
01:05:16.791 --> 01:05:18.083
Hang on. let me finish.

1044
01:05:19.041 --> 01:05:20.958
My love for you burns brightly.

1045
01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:24.791
-Angelica…
-Please don't kneel.

1046
01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:27.041
Will you marry me?

1047
01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:35.291
-Angelica…
-I'm sorry.

1048
01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:38.875
Angelica!

1049
01:05:48.416 --> 01:05:50.541
-Bummer.
-Not good.

1050
01:05:51.125 --> 01:05:52.375
That's cool.

1051
01:05:52.458 --> 01:05:53.416
Tough luck.

1052
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.791
Let's party on!

1053
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.208
You're dead. motherfucker!

1054
01:06:09.583 --> 01:06:11.916
Hello. Angelica? Are you in there?

1055
01:06:18.666 --> 01:06:21.041
This is some déjà fucking vu!

1056
01:06:21.125 --> 01:06:22.666
You fucking cockroach!

1057
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:23.833
Paweł. wait!

1058
01:06:23.916 --> 01:06:26.791
You're fucking the woman I love!

1059
01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:27.833
Leave him alone!

1060
01:06:27.916 --> 01:06:31.125
Quit saying that!
You don't know shit about it!

1061
01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:33.166
You're wrong. I do know love. Gloria.

1062
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:35.500
-I can see our future together.
-Stop it.

1063
01:06:35.583 --> 01:06:38.708
I see us growing old together
for the next 50. 60. 70 years.

1064
01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:41.083
-What?
-Perhaps even more.

1065
01:06:41.166 --> 01:06:45.083
Until your hair is gray. my hair is
gone. and our teeth fall out. you know?

1066
01:06:46.791 --> 01:06:47.750
Teeth?

1067
01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:52.375
I mean… I just wanted to tell you:

1068
01:06:52.458 --> 01:06:56.208
I won't let you fuck up our relationship
by screwing random assholes.

1069
01:06:56.291 --> 01:06:57.166
Jesus?

1070
01:06:58.041 --> 01:06:59.500
Because I love you. Gloria.

1071
01:07:00.833 --> 01:07:02.375
And I'm not gonna leave you.

1072
01:07:02.458 --> 01:07:03.625
Ever.

1073
01:07:07.833 --> 01:07:08.916
What the fuck?

1074
01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:15.708
-Filip? What are you doing here?
-What am I doing here?

1075
01:07:15.791 --> 01:07:17.000
What are you doing here?

1076
01:07:17.083 --> 01:07:19.291
-How old are you?
-Are you OK?

1077
01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:21.291
Who the fuck is he? And his age?

1078
01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:23.250
He could be your son! Unfortunately.

1079
01:07:23.333 --> 01:07:24.791
I am your son.

1080
01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:28.208
-Honey!
-You're fucking all the guys my own age!

1081
01:07:28.291 --> 01:07:31.833
You're merciless. You're ruining my life--

1082
01:07:31.916 --> 01:07:33.791
Don't talk to your mother like that!

1083
01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:35.625
She sacrificed so much for you!

1084
01:07:35.708 --> 01:07:37.916
You know your dad was banging Kasia
on the side?

1085
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.083
Hey!

1086
01:07:40.166 --> 01:07:42.833
-Isn't it true?
-I'm sorry. calm down.

1087
01:07:42.916 --> 01:07:44.250
What is he talking about?

1088
01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:48.500
He was a good father to you.
but he was a terrible husband.

1089
01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:50.875
Then why didn't you ever tell me?

1090
01:07:50.958 --> 01:07:53.333
I didn't want to traumatize you.

1091
01:07:53.416 --> 01:07:54.875
-What?!
-Filip!

1092
01:07:54.958 --> 01:07:56.250
Take it easy.

1093
01:07:56.333 --> 01:07:59.125
That's fucking great. Mom.

1094
01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:01.250
Everybody. calm down.

1095
01:08:01.333 --> 01:08:04.416
Congratulations! Great fucking job!

1096
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.708
Don't worry. son. It's gonna be alright.

1097
01:08:07.791 --> 01:08:09.958
-What did you say?
-Filip. son--

1098
01:08:10.041 --> 01:08:12.708
Hey! Leave him alone!

1099
01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:15.958
Paweł!

1100
01:08:20.708 --> 01:08:22.000
Paweł!

1101
01:08:23.208 --> 01:08:25.291
Filip. please!

1102
01:08:25.375 --> 01:08:26.291
Filip?!

1103
01:08:26.875 --> 01:08:29.875
You banged Anastasia?! Motherfucker!

1104
01:08:31.416 --> 01:08:32.333
You dumb shit!

1105
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.083
Who's looking dumb now?

1106
01:08:39.166 --> 01:08:40.333
Huh?

1107
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.041
Christ…

1108
01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:49.833
why is sex so complicated?

1109
01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:52.541
I told you. my son.

1110
01:08:52.625 --> 01:08:56.750
Love is the foundation
of peace and forgiveness.

1111
01:08:56.833 --> 01:08:59.541
Focus on your inner peace.

1112
01:08:59.625 --> 01:09:02.833
you will find both solace
and the most important thing in life.

1113
01:09:03.583 --> 01:09:05.166
-Love.
-Jesus…

1114
01:09:05.791 --> 01:09:07.833
-You see him too?
-What?

1115
01:09:16.125 --> 01:09:17.333
Angelica…

1116
01:09:17.958 --> 01:09:19.166
what's wrong?

1117
01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:21.708
I'm sorry about the ring thing.

1118
01:09:24.791 --> 01:09:29.000
Sorry I did it in public…
Didn't you like the ring or something?

1119
01:09:29.083 --> 01:09:33.083
I thought it was just
what we both wanted. Isn't it?

1120
01:09:33.166 --> 01:09:34.791
I know I want it.

1121
01:09:34.875 --> 01:09:39.041
"Want. want"! Fuck. I want something. too!
And you don't give it to me!

1122
01:09:39.125 --> 01:09:40.416
What is it. though?

1123
01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:43.250
I give you everything you wish!
What are you saying?

1124
01:09:43.333 --> 01:09:46.833
The thing is you don't give me
anything! Go away!

1125
01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:49.416
-Oh no. Angelica--
-"Oh yes. Angelica!"

1126
01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:50.750
-Just go!
-No way.

1127
01:09:50.833 --> 01:09:54.250
You said something.
Now tell me what you meant!

1128
01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:55.375
Just go away!

1129
01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:57.708
Tell me. what don't I give you?

1130
01:09:57.791 --> 01:10:00.416
-Because I don't understand.
-Oh my…

1131
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.791
Angelica. please open the door.
Let's talk about it.

1132
01:10:03.875 --> 01:10:06.833
You fucking suck in bed. Daniel!

1133
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.333
Plot twist!

1134
01:10:09.416 --> 01:10:10.791
You're just the worst.

1135
01:10:10.875 --> 01:10:13.500
You don't even know
how to take me like a man.

1136
01:10:13.583 --> 01:10:15.333
don't know how to go down on me!

1137
01:10:15.416 --> 01:10:19.291
You always fuck me
in the same three positions!

1138
01:10:19.375 --> 01:10:21.458
Missionary or doggy style.

1139
01:10:21.541 --> 01:10:23.666
Either the classic way or from behind.

1140
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:27.000
That's the limit of your imagination!

1141
01:10:27.083 --> 01:10:29.333
Daniel. this is just pathetic!

1142
01:10:29.416 --> 01:10:30.625
Pathetic!

1143
01:10:30.708 --> 01:10:32.416
Let me in. people are here.

1144
01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:35.041
Well. fuck it! Let everybody know!

1145
01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:38.000
Hello. people!

1146
01:10:38.083 --> 01:10:41.333
The Man Who Sucks In Bed The Most
is here! His name's Daniel!

1147
01:10:41.416 --> 01:10:42.750
Please. let me in!

1148
01:10:42.833 --> 01:10:44.958
And the fucking worst part is

1149
01:10:45.041 --> 01:10:46.791
that you never made me come.

1150
01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:48.041
Not once. Got it?

1151
01:10:48.125 --> 01:10:50.541
What? I made you come a thousand times.

1152
01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:54.083
A thousand fucking times!

1153
01:10:55.416 --> 01:10:57.083
A thousand times!

1154
01:10:57.166 --> 01:11:02.291
Sure. a million. a trillion.
why the fuck not?

1155
01:11:03.083 --> 01:11:08.208
Look. Daniel. I really think that
you're a nice guy. you know?

1156
01:11:08.291 --> 01:11:09.291
Really!

1157
01:11:09.375 --> 01:11:12.833
And it hurts me to say this
as much as it hurts you to hear it.

1158
01:11:12.916 --> 01:11:16.000
But. Daniel. you are just…

1159
01:11:16.083 --> 01:11:17.791
a fucking pussy!

1160
01:11:18.625 --> 01:11:20.333
Did you finally get the message?

1161
01:11:20.416 --> 01:11:25.416
Ladies and gentlemen. I present to you:
the world's biggest and warmest pussy!

1162
01:11:27.625 --> 01:11:29.125
Do you hear me?

1163
01:11:30.375 --> 01:11:31.250
Daniel?

1164
01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:49.791
You are done.
you worthless degenerate. You're fired!

1165
01:11:49.875 --> 01:11:52.916
I'm coming back right now.
I'm coming. you fucking moron!

1166
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.708
Listen to me closely. you dimwit:
You're nothing. a nobody. a walking zero.

1167
01:11:57.791 --> 01:11:59.875
A useless burden! A goatfuck--

1168
01:11:59.958 --> 01:12:03.541
-Hello!
-The whole fucking house is on fire!

1169
01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:08.041
-What about my mom? Is she safe?
-The amount of damage! It's millions!

1170
01:12:08.125 --> 01:12:10.250
But where is my mom?
Is she fucking OK?

1171
01:12:10.333 --> 01:12:13.916
Who gives a fuck?
The whole block's on fire!

1172
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.750
The only person
who gives one shred of fuck

1173
01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.541
about a pointless imbecile like you

1174
01:12:19.625 --> 01:12:20.916
is your mommy.

1175
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.708
So why don't you just
do everyone a big favor

1176
01:12:23.791 --> 01:12:25.125
and kill yourself?

1177
01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:27.000
Fuck you! Do you hear me?

1178
01:12:27.083 --> 01:12:28.625
Fuck you!

1179
01:12:51.083 --> 01:12:56.458
DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD. BUT IT WASN'T ME.
THIS OLD HAG MADE ME DO THAT. WHERE R U?

1180
01:13:00.833 --> 01:13:03.333
-Don't fucking touch me.
-I wasn't touching you!

1181
01:13:03.416 --> 01:13:05.750
No? So whose hand was it just now?

1182
01:13:05.833 --> 01:13:08.458
-Mine. and yours was touching it!
-I…

1183
01:13:08.541 --> 01:13:10.125
I didn't touch you!

1184
01:13:10.666 --> 01:13:11.791
You homo.

1185
01:13:11.875 --> 01:13:15.708
-Who are you calling homo. man?
-I'm calling you homo. pal.

1186
01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:17.875
-I'm not homo. buddy!
-You are.

1187
01:13:17.958 --> 01:13:19.750
-I'm not!
-Well. I think you are.

1188
01:13:24.625 --> 01:13:26.666
-You know what?
-What?

1189
01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:28.958
Homo!

1190
01:13:39.333 --> 01:13:42.250
Leave me the fuck alone!

1191
01:13:42.916 --> 01:13:44.333
Fuck off!

1192
01:13:46.625 --> 01:13:48.666
Get away from me!

1193
01:13:50.083 --> 01:13:51.333
Jesus.

1194
01:14:28.291 --> 01:14:31.333
Cupcake…

1195
01:14:35.583 --> 01:14:36.708
Cupcake…

1196
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:48.083
I'm a pussy. is that right?

1197
01:14:49.375 --> 01:14:51.291
I'm a fucking pussy?!

1198
01:14:52.583 --> 01:14:53.458
Fuck!

1199
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:57.375
Angelica!

1200
01:14:58.208 --> 01:14:59.916
I'm a pussy?

1201
01:15:08.666 --> 01:15:10.791
I'm a fucking pussy. is that right?

1202
01:15:32.166 --> 01:15:33.541
No. no!

1203
01:15:33.625 --> 01:15:35.708
Stay away from my family!

1204
01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:37.166
Are you two family?

1205
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:38.416
Get off him!

1206
01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.125
-Calm down. son.
-Don't call me "son"!

1207
01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.166
Fuck!

1208
01:15:50.791 --> 01:15:53.625
Who killed Marek?

1209
01:15:53.708 --> 01:15:55.125
Hey. Rafał. what's this?

1210
01:15:56.666 --> 01:15:57.541
Fuck!

1211
01:15:58.416 --> 01:16:01.125
They'll hold the New Year off. you'll see.

1212
01:16:01.208 --> 01:16:02.500
Hey!

1213
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:05.208
Did we miss it?

1214
01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:23.125
My implants! They were a gift from Daddy!

1215
01:16:30.958 --> 01:16:32.916
I'm a fucking pussy. is that right?

1216
01:16:37.708 --> 01:16:39.250
A fucking pussy. yes?

1217
01:16:43.875 --> 01:16:45.041
Daniel!

1218
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:47.416
You motherfucker!

1219
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.958
You fucking whore!

1220
01:16:54.958 --> 01:16:56.166
Ladies and gentlemen…

1221
01:16:57.458 --> 01:16:59.583
Ten! Nine!

1222
01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:01.333
Eight!

1223
01:17:01.958 --> 01:17:03.416
Seven!

1224
01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.250
Six!

1225
01:17:05.333 --> 01:17:06.208
Five!

1226
01:17:07.166 --> 01:17:09.291
Four! Three!

1227
01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:10.250
Daniel!

1228
01:17:10.333 --> 01:17:11.458
Two!

1229
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:13.916
One!

1230
01:17:16.208 --> 01:17:18.250
Happy New Year!

1231
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:31.041
Gloria!

1232
01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.666
Gloria!

1233
01:19:24.625 --> 01:19:26.000
Gloria.

1234
01:21:50.458 --> 01:21:52.041
Jordan…

1235
01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:55.625
Jordan. baby.

1236
01:23:02.875 --> 01:23:05.250
Chemistry is the study of matter.

1237
01:23:06.041 --> 01:23:08.666
But I prefer to see this branch of science

1238
01:23:09.708 --> 01:23:11.375
as a study of everything.

1239
01:23:12.458 --> 01:23:16.041
We're all elements. composed by atoms.

1240
01:23:16.125 --> 01:23:19.958
categorized and divided into groups
according to certain properties:

1241
01:23:21.333 --> 01:23:24.166
We interact and bond with each other.

1242
01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:27.041
creating chemical reactions.

1243
01:23:29.166 --> 01:23:31.666
Some substances do not go together.

1244
01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:35.875
so they cannot react with each other.

1245
01:23:38.583 --> 01:23:42.833
Others do react.
which results in our atoms rearranging

1246
01:23:42.916 --> 01:23:44.916
and forming new bonds.

1247
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.333
New products.

1248
01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:53.500
And none of these chemical reactions
would be possible without the energy.

1249
01:23:53.583 --> 01:23:58.208
in the form of heat. light.
electricity or mechanical force.

1250
01:24:00.833 --> 01:24:03.166
That is the circle of life.

1251
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.208
Elements dancing round and round.

1252
01:24:09.416 --> 01:24:11.916
Reacting to this ecstasy of life.

1253
01:24:16.708 --> 01:24:18.000
PS:

1254
01:24:18.083 --> 01:24:22.000
I developed a hypothesis
for my mom's Alzheimer's.

1255
01:24:22.708 --> 01:24:26.041
It's just a theory.
I couldn't afford laboratory tests.

1256
01:24:26.125 --> 01:24:28.541
And now I'd be thrown out of school. so…

1257
01:24:28.625 --> 01:24:29.708
you're welcome.

1258
01:24:30.291 --> 01:24:32.083
Here it is for somebody to find.

1259
01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:37.208
I hope you use it for the greater good.

1260
01:24:37.291 --> 01:24:40.750
Maybe now everyone will remember me.

1261
01:24:42.875 --> 01:24:45.666
OK. so who's the Elvis here again?

1262
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:46.833
Nobody knows.

1263
01:24:46.916 --> 01:24:51.000
Damn. it's a pity he didn't leave
a note. a message. anything.

1264
01:24:53.041 --> 01:24:54.166
Oh. well.

1265
01:24:54.791 --> 01:24:55.833
We're done here.

1266
01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:58.416
What do you mean. done?

1267
01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.750
All this pizza talk got me hungry.

1268
01:25:00.833 --> 01:25:03.083
Wait a second. This is not right!

1269
01:25:04.958 --> 01:25:06.458
Grzegorz…

1270
01:25:06.541 --> 01:25:08.958
The sooner you let go of old clothes.

1271
01:25:09.833 --> 01:25:12.583
the sooner you'll find new ones.

1272
01:25:15.333 --> 01:25:17.291
-Clothes?
-Never mind.

1273
01:25:17.375 --> 01:25:19.416
Congratulations on your first case.

1274
01:25:20.833 --> 01:25:22.250
-Thank you.
-Awesome.

1275
01:26:09.833 --> 01:26:13.166
There are good ships and wood ships.

1276
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:15.833
battle ships and rocket ships.

1277
01:26:16.958 --> 01:26:19.833
but the best kind of
ships are relationships.

1278
01:26:25.958 --> 01:26:27.916
-What?
-The rings.

1279
01:26:33.708 --> 01:26:34.750
Relax!

1280
01:26:47.375 --> 01:26:51.541
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1281
01:26:56.375 --> 01:26:57.833
Amen!

1282
01:27:32.291 --> 01:27:33.333
I love you.

1283
01:27:33.416 --> 01:27:34.583
And I love--

1284
01:27:41.375 --> 01:27:43.333
Look at our boy growing up.

1285
01:28:09.125 --> 01:28:11.000
I love you. homo!

1286
01:28:17.541 --> 01:28:18.833
Here you go. baby.

1287
01:28:20.416 --> 01:28:21.541
Thanks.

1288
01:28:22.416 --> 01:28:25.000
-Do you need anything else?
-Some space?

1289
01:28:25.958 --> 01:28:27.916
It's always all about me. me. me!

1290
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.166
You're suffocating me!

1291
01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:31.958
In a parallel universe
all of this would be different.

1292
01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:34.833
It would be more… exciting.

1293
01:28:35.375 --> 01:28:37.875
Well. at least we're together.

1294
01:28:37.958 --> 01:28:39.458
Right?

1295
01:28:43.333 --> 01:28:44.375
Hey!

1296
01:28:45.166 --> 01:28:48.000
Aren't you the guy
who invented that cure for--

1297
01:28:48.083 --> 01:28:49.625
Alzheimer's.

1298
01:28:50.166 --> 01:28:51.500
Exactly.

1299
01:28:52.416 --> 01:28:57.166
Did you know that Gemini
and Aquarius are really compatible?

1300
01:28:58.375 --> 01:29:01.208
Tell me. honey.
how do you know my sign?

1301
01:29:01.291 --> 01:29:02.500
I have a gift.

1302
01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:06.000
I read people.

1303
01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:13.000
And I sense epic chemistry between us.

1304
01:29:18.166 --> 01:29:19.333
Anastasia…

1305
01:29:22.458 --> 01:29:24.333
…is to be brave.

1306
01:29:30.166 --> 01:29:31.166
I'm Filip.

1307
01:29:33.375 --> 01:29:34.416
Bogdan.

1308
01:29:34.958 --> 01:29:35.958
Bogdan?

1309
01:29:36.041 --> 01:29:38.708
Aren't you the famous rapper. Jordan?

1310
01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:41.000
Not anymore.

1311
01:29:41.625 --> 01:29:44.750
I am now focusing on
my relationship with Anastasia.

1312
01:30:05.541 --> 01:30:06.708
Come in…

1313
01:30:15.958 --> 01:30:17.166
What's this?

1314
01:30:18.166 --> 01:30:19.541
Some kind of key.

1315
01:30:25.458 --> 01:30:26.666
Oh. fuck.
