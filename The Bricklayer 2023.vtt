just as we agreed.

00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:41.128
Of course you are.

9
00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:43.173
You're very ambitious...

10
00:00:43.217 --> 00:00:45.610
and you know this story is gold.

11
00:00:49.397 --> 00:00:50.833
Did you bring it?

12
00:00:50.963 --> 00:00:53.009
You're no fan of
US intelligence.

13
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.925
You're a little short
on the details.

14
00:00:56.143 --> 00:00:57.579

No. you can't have them.

Yes. you can take photos.

19
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.968
This type of scandal could
destroy the US.

Yes.

You want this story out there.

25
00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:03.079
I do.

But unfortunately for you...

27
00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:08.128
I want to be the one
to do the telling.

28
00:02:12.393 --> 00:02:14.873
Is the CIA murdering
journalists?

29
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:19.791

was found dead in a Greek hotel.

in a month.

32

Miss Becker was an
outspoken critic
of US intelligence
activities abroad.

when asked about the incident.

35
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:40.551
For decades. the United States

of other nations.

37
00:02:44.207 --> 00:02:48.951

like the Wild West are over.

[Kate] Hey.

39
00:03:10.015 --> 00:03:11.495
It's nice of you to show up.

40
00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.149
I like to work at night.

41
00:03:13.454 --> 00:03:15.282
Because you have no life?

42
00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:17.414
Because it's easier to focus.

43
00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:18.676
What have you got for me?

44
00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:19.851
Jack and shit.

45
00:03:20.243 --> 00:03:23.420
The hotel Greta Becker
was staying at has no CCTV

46
00:03:23.464 --> 00:03:26.728
so I've scanned the
streets around
and the train station opposite.

Nothing.

48
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.688
I did see a nun
traveling with a full drum kit.

That was a new one.

50
00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:35.780
Hey. I said I already
checked those.

51
00:03:35.824 --> 00:03:38.392

But I might see something
you didn't.

57
00:04:32.359 --> 00:04:33.229
This is urgent.

58
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.545

Why are you wasting my time?

63
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.596
Because they missed this.

64
00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:54.903

65
00:04:57.209 --> 00:04:58.776
Have you told Thessaloniki?

66
00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.951
I haven't told anyone.

67
00:05:00.082 --> 00:05:01.388
What do you know about him?

68
00:05:01.431 --> 00:05:03.085
Most of his files were redacted.

but grew up all over.

71
00:05:08.264 --> 00:05:10.092
But they never did
find his body.

72
00:05:10.266 --> 00:05:12.399
He was a covert CIA operative

73

working as an intermediary
between
the Russian and Greek Mafias.

74
00:05:15.924 --> 00:05:17.360

Radek's one of the most
dangerous men I've ever known

means. don't you?

And he's got secrets to tell.

just a cursory fact-finding.

know that Radek is alive.

around the Greeks

as our own people.

you should reconsider

00:46:05.588 --> 00:46:08.635
So close I can smell
his indigestion.

540
00:46:09.418 --> 00:46:11.116
Four espressos already.

541
00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:12.770
Seems a bit nervous.

542
00:46:30.875 --> 00:46:33.921
Twelve Apostle Church
always was your favorite
drop spot.

543
00:46:34.008 --> 00:46:36.097
I love the frescoes.

544
00:46:36.445 --> 00:46:38.926
Even had dinner with
some of the monks

545
00:46:39.274 --> 00:46:41.233
we made Clams Kokkinisto.

546
00:46:41.537 --> 00:46:43.148
That goes against protocol.

547
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:45.933
Something we were always
very good at.

548
00:46:46.194 --> 00:46:47.979
I meant for the monks.

549
00:46:48.066 --> 00:46:48.936
Oh.

550
00:46:49.197 --> 00:46:51.112
They shouldn't be eating
past midday.

551
00:46:51.591 --> 00:46:53.071
You must be surprised

552
00:46:53.288 --> 00:46:55.377
seeing as I'm supposed
to be dead and all.

553
00:46:56.204 --> 00:46:58.163
Surprised isn't the
word I'd use.

554
00:46:58.859 --> 00:46:59.729
Angry.

555
00:47:00.382 --> 00:47:01.688
More like confused. Victor.

556
00:47:01.731 --> 00:47:05.126
We had a deal. I let
you go. you disappear.

557
00:47:05.561 --> 00:47:06.606
Forever.

[Greek protest chant]

559
00:47:24.972 --> 00:47:26.931
Vail. I'm blind.
What do you see?

560
00:47:31.631 --> 00:47:32.588
Vail?

561
00:47:34.155 --> 00:47:34.982
Vail!

562
00:47:38.681 --> 00:47:39.944
I did go away.

563
00:47:41.641 --> 00:47:43.208
But I couldn't help but feel

564
00:47:43.904 --> 00:47:45.166
what's the word you used?

565
00:47:46.167 --> 00:47:49.954
Confused. You see.
we never did find out

566
00:47:49.997 --> 00:47:51.912
who blew my cover.

567
00:47:52.086 --> 00:47:53.696
And I hate mysteries.

568
00:47:54.959 --> 00:47:57.875
It's an itch I've needed
to scratch.

They say old wounds
are best left unscratched.

570
00:48:02.618 --> 00:48:04.490
These don't feel old to me.

00:48:14.892 --> 00:48:16.981
You know how efficient I can be.

in one direction.

The agency.

576
00:48:25.206 --> 00:48:26.991
That's not possible.

577
00:48:27.165 --> 00:48:28.644
I would have known about it.

578
00:48:28.688 --> 00:48:30.733
Maybe you did.

579
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.562
Maybe that's why I
sent some friends
to come and see you
in Philadelphia.

580
00:48:33.736 --> 00:48:35.651
Why would the agency
blow your cover?

581
00:48:35.956 --> 00:48:37.262
You know why.

582

it's fucking crazy. Victor.

I'm only going to warn you once.

yourself. then do it for her.

You weren't able to
protect my family.

This is why you got
fired once already.

606

I didn't get fired. I quit.

A civilian!

609
00:50:56.314 --> 00:50:58.707
The agency is going to
get heat for this.

610
00:50:58.794 --> 00:51:00.709
Okay. so which one
are we sad about?

611
00:51:01.101 --> 00:51:02.885
The civilian or the agency?

612
00:51:04.496 --> 00:51:05.453
Tell me.

613
00:51:07.542 --> 00:51:10.067
The photo that Radek left
at the scene of the crime.

614
00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:11.111
Who was it?

615
00:51:12.286 --> 00:51:15.985
Luis Del Gato.
Cuban ambassador to the UN.

616
00:51:16.464 --> 00:51:18.118
Del Gato? But he's...

617
00:51:18.205 --> 00:51:22.035
Alive. Which means Radek
doesn't just have a list
of past CIA hits

618
00:51:22.122 --> 00:51:25.865
-he has a list of active
targets as well.
-We need to call this
into O'Malley.

619
00:51:25.908 --> 00:51:28.607
Kate. don't you get it?

620
00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:31.392
O'Malley already knows.

621
00:51:31.871 --> 00:51:33.873
Then why is it just us here?

622
00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:35.440
If this list gets out

623
00:51:35.483 --> 00:51:38.138
it's going to unite the
entire world against us.

624
00:51:38.182 --> 00:51:40.488
Now you're starting to
ask the right questions.

625
00:51:40.575 --> 00:51:42.273
I can think of two reasons.

626
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.666
One: O'Malley is covering
his own ass.

627
00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:47.452
He was station chief
when I was here.

628
00:51:47.495 --> 00:51:49.018
Radek happened under his watch.

629
00:51:49.149 --> 00:51:50.672
Okay. and two?

630
00:51:50.716 --> 00:51:52.021
Think about it. Kate.

631
00:51:52.065 --> 00:51:54.763
Somebody has to be leaking
the info to Radek.

632
00:51:57.201 --> 00:51:59.899
You think O'Malley is the mole?

633
00:52:02.771 --> 00:52:04.730
I don't trust anybody
at the agency.

634
00:52:05.078 --> 00:52:06.384
And you shouldn't either.

635
00:52:07.428 --> 00:52:09.430
But you trust Tye Delson.

636
00:52:09.517 --> 00:52:11.128
You read her in. didn't you?

637
00:52:11.215 --> 00:52:12.433
At the art gallery.

638
00:52:13.478 --> 00:52:15.132
Don't look so surprised.

639
00:52:15.175 --> 00:52:16.785
You knew that I was
tracking you.

640
00:52:16.872 --> 00:52:19.179
You didn't think
I would check the guest list.

641
00:52:19.223 --> 00:52:21.486
See. you do have
the necessary trust issues.

642
00:52:21.529 --> 00:52:24.184
So why won't you direct
them toward the right people?

643
00:52:24.228 --> 00:52:29.320
Because I'm trying to make two
and two equal four
with you. Vail.

644
00:52:29.885 --> 00:52:32.279
You keep saying that
we can't trust the agency...

645
00:52:32.323 --> 00:52:34.673
and then you go and read
in the head of station.

646
00:52:34.716 --> 00:52:36.022
None of this makes sense.

647
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:37.415
Tye is...

648
00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:41.810
She's an old friend.

649
00:52:42.942 --> 00:52:44.639
You're a hypocrite.

Don't answer it.

00:52:53.735 --> 00:52:55.520
You really are paranoid.
aren't you?

655
00:52:56.999 --> 00:52:59.088
Yes. sir. Go ahead.

00:53:01.743 --> 00:53:04.703
If the CIA is responsible
for these murders

657
00:53:04.746 --> 00:53:07.488
the whole United States
will be held accountable.

658
00:53:07.532 --> 00:53:11.013
Mr. Melas paid the
ultimate price.
but his death

659
00:53:11.492 --> 00:53:13.233
his sacrifice

660
00:53:13.277 --> 00:53:15.583

to announce the findings
of his investigation.

669

Does he have anything?

670
00:54:03.283 --> 00:54:04.763
O'Malley doesn't think so.

671
00:54:05.154 --> 00:54:08.288
But after the hit today
at the market.
it doesn't look good for us.

I saw Radek. Spoke to him.

676

And?

677
00:54:22.563 --> 00:54:24.348
Did you know that the agency

678
00:54:24.783 --> 00:54:26.132
blew his cover?

over as head of station.

680

They said it was a
necessary evil.

681
00:54:33.357 --> 00:54:36.360
It was a crime. committed by
the CIA against one
of their own.

682
00:54:36.447 --> 00:54:38.840
From what I understand.
the Russians
were responsible
for the killing.

wash its hands of this.

then one day. he
refused to hold up his
end of the bargain.

686
00:54:47.545 --> 00:54:51.418
You know damn well
what they asked us
to do. and you know why
we couldn't do it.

When O'Malley called
and offered me the job

711
00:55:53.437 --> 00:55:55.352
it may have been the
wrong choice...

712
00:55:58.006 --> 00:55:59.921
but I have to live with it.

713
00:56:22.248 --> 00:56:24.293
You know. sometimes
the easiest choices

714
00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:26.687
are the ones you don't
have to make by yourself.

to think.

If O'Malley's working
with Radek.

01:01:09.535 --> 01:01:10.754

Secret meetings in back rooms?

897
01:13:40.677 --> 01:13:41.982
Anything for my country.

898
01:13:43.244 --> 01:13:48.162
All right. listen up.
Radek has asked
for somebody by name
to make the drop.

899
01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:50.251
Anyone else and it's off.

900
01:13:50.904 --> 01:13:52.210
Our rising star.

901
01:13:53.167 --> 01:13:53.994
Bannon.

902
01:13:54.212 --> 01:13:56.257
What?! You can't go.

903
01:13:56.649 --> 01:13:58.390
We have no choice.

904
01:13:58.477 --> 01:14:00.958
Come on. O'Malley.
You know Radek
only asked for her to get to me.

905
01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:03.526
You're done. Vail.
Thank you for your service.

906
01:14:03.917 --> 01:14:05.353
Excuse me?

907
01:14:05.832 --> 01:14:08.922
I think it's safe to
say you've done
enough damage across this city.

908
01:14:08.966 --> 01:14:09.836
You're out.

909
01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:23.676
O'Malley.

910
01:14:24.503 --> 01:14:28.115
you might be the dumbest
son of a bitch
to ever cash a government
paycheck

911
01:14:28.855 --> 01:14:30.291
and that's saying something.

912
01:14:46.743 --> 01:14:47.526
Bannon.

913
01:14:50.094 --> 01:14:51.008
You got this?

914
01:14:51.835 --> 01:14:53.140
That's what I'm here for.

915
01:14:53.532 --> 01:14:54.577
He knows our faces.

916
01:14:55.273 --> 01:14:57.014
So. we can't get too
close to you.

917
01:14:57.057 --> 01:14:59.495
but we'll be tracking you
every step of the way.

918
01:14:59.538 --> 01:15:00.626
We've got your back.

919
01:15:00.713 --> 01:15:02.367
Remind me how that usually goes?

920
01:15:02.759 --> 01:15:05.762
It helps to remember
we're the good guys Bannon.

921
01:15:08.199 --> 01:15:09.548
I know who I am. sir.

922
01:15:09.766 --> 01:15:11.898
The bitcoin is loaded
onto the flash drive.

923
01:15:12.116 --> 01:15:15.902
Once Radek takes possession.
we'll grab him. bring him in.

925
01:15:44.888 --> 01:15:46.542
Three stops. correct?

926
01:15:46.977 --> 01:15:47.847
Affirmative.

927
01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:50.633
Copy that.

928
01:16:18.269 --> 01:16:19.575
I have the package.

929
01:16:29.323 --> 01:16:30.411
Bingo.

930
01:16:36.679 --> 01:16:37.984
I found the tavern.

931
01:18:46.025 --> 01:18:48.898
This is why nobody does
business with the CIA.

932
01:18:49.289 --> 01:18:50.813
They cannot follow directions.

933
01:18:51.509 --> 01:18:53.206
That was a low blow. Victor.

934
01:18:53.337 --> 01:18:54.468
Asking for Bannon?

935
01:18:55.034 --> 01:18:56.644
I thought it was kind of funny.

936
01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:59.517
No. Killing my friend.

937
01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:02.172
I warned you to not
get involved.

938
01:19:03.086 --> 01:19:06.567
Seems like anyone who gets
close to you ends
up in the dirt.

939
01:19:06.785 --> 01:19:08.744
So why don't you come down.

940
01:19:08.787 --> 01:19:10.397
collect your money?

941
01:19:10.484 --> 01:19:12.138
You and I can get real close.

942
01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:14.140
Even as we speak.

943
01:19:15.838 --> 01:19:17.578
You can't hide from me. Victor.

944
01:19:18.362 --> 01:19:20.886
I'll never. ever stop coming.

945
01:19:21.321 --> 01:19:23.019
I'm not going anywhere.

946
01:19:23.628 --> 01:19:24.977
I'm tired. Vail.

947
01:19:25.978 --> 01:19:27.501
And I want to make peace.

948
01:19:28.589 --> 01:19:30.809
This sure is a fucked
up way of showing it

949
01:19:30.853 --> 01:19:32.680
There's only one
final hit to do.

950
01:19:33.594 --> 01:19:34.595
One assignment.

951
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:37.381
Kostas?

952
01:19:37.555 --> 01:19:38.425
That's right.

953
01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:40.123
A list is nothing.

954
01:19:40.645 --> 01:19:42.690
They're just words on paper.

955
01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:45.955
But seeing. that is believing.

956
01:19:46.303 --> 01:19:48.348
I'm going to broadcast
to the whole world

doing in the shadows

01:19:54.093 --> 01:19:55.312
you kill him.

961
01:19:58.837 --> 01:20:00.883
millions of lives will be lost.

962
01:20:02.101 --> 01:20:04.800
Sadly. as it must be.

963
01:20:06.627 --> 01:20:08.804
I cannot suffer alone
any longer.

964

the Central Intelligence Agency

That would be the Greeks.

you guys square.

in the van.

That's what it's there
for. to plug holes.

Notice we're watching cartoons
instead of World War III?

1018
01:28:04.844 --> 01:28:07.717
That's because Kostas thinks
the CIA saved him.

1019
01:28:08.152 --> 01:28:10.633
We took the liberty of
claiming you as our own.

That must have hurt.

manifesto inside of his van.

on behalf of the CIA.

So just the truth then. huh?

1025
01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:25.648
Truth is subjective.

1026
01:28:26.649 --> 01:28:29.042
Thankfully. we found
it before anyone else.

1027
01:28:29.521 --> 01:28:32.219
Radek is dead. The
list is secure.

1028
01:28:33.133 --> 01:28:37.442
But you did interfere

to take a hike.

Why bricklaying?

Oh. come on.

1036
01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:00.030
You could be making
a killing out there
consulting. but you're
laying brick. Why?

1037
01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:02.598
Because when I hold
a brick in my hand.

1038
01:29:03.381 --> 01:29:05.209
I know exactly what it is

1039
01:29:05.862 --> 01:29:06.906
and what it will do.

1040
01:29:07.646 --> 01:29:08.821
Every single time.

1041
01:29:09.866 --> 01:29:12.347
Its form is its function.

1042
01:29:13.609 --> 01:29:14.958
That gives me peace.

1043
01:29:15.698 --> 01:29:20.180
I don't know what
the fuck any of
that means. but it sounds good.

1044
01:29:20.877 --> 01:29:22.357
I didn't expect you would.

1045
01:29:31.148 --> 01:29:32.976

1046
01:29:33.019 --> 01:29:35.761
we can't just let him
get away with it.

1047
01:29:36.632 --> 01:29:37.720
O'Malley must have it.

1048
01:29:37.763 --> 01:29:39.374
He needs to be held accountable.

1049
01:29:39.417 --> 01:29:41.463
O'Malley will get what's
coming to him.

1050
01:29:43.116 --> 01:29:44.640
Not from us.

1051
01:29:44.901 --> 01:29:45.945
So that's it?

1052
01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:47.164

1053
01:29:48.992 --> 01:29:50.123

1055
01:29:53.170 --> 01:29:54.737
Radek was a complicated man.

1056
01:29:54.867 --> 01:29:56.129
But I knew what drove him.

1057
01:29:56.173 --> 01:29:57.870
I knew his weaknesses.

1058
01:29:58.175 --> 01:29:59.655
Guys like O'Malley.

1059
01:29:59.698 --> 01:30:01.308
they live for the politics.

as casually as signing
a lunch bill.

never understand.

Checked out early.

1071
01:31:05.242 --> 01:31:07.505
I was just coming
to see you right before I...

1072
01:31:09.942 --> 01:31:11.857
It's been a rough
couple of weeks.

1073
01:31:12.336 --> 01:31:14.556
I thought I'd get out
