Master Wayne. come along now.

24
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:27.857
Time for your cookie-wookies
before bedtime.

25
00:02:27.857 --> 00:02:29.817
Not yet. Alfred.

26
00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:30.985
Selina stole priceless art

27
00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:32.820
- from the Gotham City Museum.

28
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.822
I must have justice.

29
00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:39.827
- Ha!

30
00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:45.541
{\an8}Phew! Close one. huh. Alfred?

31
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:47.001
Close indeed.

32
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.044
Now. let's end this madcappery

33
00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:50.588
before you actually
do break...

34
00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:54.675
...something like your great
grandfather's ashes.

35
00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:56.760
- And that priceless Picasso.

36
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.769
There's no way to run. Selina.

37
00:03:16.113 --> 00:03:17.072
Ah-ha!

38
00:03:21.744 --> 00:03:23.996
Young man. may I remind you

39
00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:26.707
that Christmas is a mere
two days away?

40
00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:29.084
Father Christmas is watching.

41
00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:32.630
Good! 'Cause even Santa
wouldn't wanna miss this.

42
00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:35.382
- Ha!

43
00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:39.720
Whoa!

44
00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:41.472
Master Wayne.

45
00:03:42.765 --> 00:03:44.683
Will you be sleeping
down there again?

46
00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:48.938
Whoa!

47
00:03:55.611 --> 00:03:56.612
Whoa!

48
00:03:57.863 --> 00:03:59.114
No. No. No. no. no.

49
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.283
Whoa!

50
00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:03.702
Whoa!

51
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:16.006
{\an8}What?

52
00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:25.766
Uh-oh.

53
00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:31.855
How's it going?

54
00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:34.525
Oh. my gosh!

55
00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:36.610
Are you okay?
Did you fall through that vent?

56
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.237
Damian. you could've
gotten hurt.

57
00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:39.571
You shouldn't play
with the cat.

58
00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.490
You could've gotten
scratched. or worse!

59
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.658
You could've gotten
a brain parasite

60
00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:44.076
from its fecal matter.

61
00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:47.663
A boo-boo!

62
00:04:48.247 --> 00:04:49.373
Aw. Dad!

63
00:04:49.373 --> 00:04:50.749
Quit worrying so much.

64
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.126
I'm totally fine.

65
00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:54.086
The HVAC unit broke
my fall. see?

66
00:04:58.841 --> 00:04:59.758
Yeah.

67
00:05:00.426 --> 00:05:03.762
Damian. what have we said
about being more careful

68
00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:06.390
and less destructive when
you're playing superhero?

69
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.475
I'm not playing. Dad.
I'm training.

70
00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:10.602
To be a real hero. Like you.

71
00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:13.939
Picture it. You and me
fighting back to back.

72
00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:15.941
Fearless defenders
of the night.

73
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:18.485
Protecting the weak.
Punishing the wicked.

74
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.487
Crime doesn't stand a chance.

75
00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:22.406
Uh-huh. And I've told you.

76
00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:24.450
you're not ready
for that kind of stuff.

77
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.492
Because being
a superhero takes...

78
00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.871
{\an8} Focus.
responsibility and sacrifice.

79
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:30.164
{\an8}I know. I know.

80
00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:32.583
Not to mention a pretty
high pain threshold.

81
00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:34.293
You know how many ribs
I've broken?

82
00:05:34.293 --> 00:05:35.377
All of them.

83
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.548
{\an8}Cool! I want to break
all of my ribs. too.

84
00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:40.841
Come on. kiddo.

85
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.593
Now look. even if I thought
you were ready

86
00:05:42.593 --> 00:05:44.803
to be a crime fighter.
which I don't.

87
00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:47.389
there isn't any crime
left in Gotham to fight.

88
00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.807
What do you mean?

89
00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:51.351
Damian? The day I found out
I was going to be a dad

90
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.312
was the happiest day
I've had since...

91
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:55.939
Well. a long time.

92
00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.108
It's like in one instant.
the only thing that mattered

93
00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:00.027
was protecting you
from ever getting hurt.

94
00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:02.237
So before you were born.

95
00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.490
I worked overtime
to make Gotham safe.

96
00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:27.763
What was that?

97
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.521
{\an8}<i>- In breaking news.</i>

98
00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:37.147
{\an8}<i>all of Gotham City's
supervillains</i>

99
00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:39.149
{\an8}<i>are now either behind bars</i>

100
00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.026
{\an8}<i>or have been forced
into retirement.</i>

101
00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:44.279
{\an8}<i>Gotham is officially
90 days crime free</i>

102
00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.865
{\an8}<i>as Batman continues
to clean it up.</i>

103
00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:48.617
{\an8}<i>Gotham City just voted</i>

104
00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.828
{\an8}<i>the safest place
on planet Earth.</i>

105
00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:56.125
There is no more crime
in Gotham.

106
00:06:57.126 --> 00:06:58.710
So enjoy being a kid.

107
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.504
But I don't wanna be
just a kid.

108
00:07:00.504 --> 00:07:03.132
Whoa! You are way more
than just a kid.

109
00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:04.633
You're "my" kid.

110
00:07:05.134 --> 00:07:07.052
- And that's the best kind.

111
00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:12.766
{\an8}Wait. Dad. what were you doing
down in the basement anyway?

112
00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.893
Me? Oh. uh. I don't know.

113
00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.228
Maybe I was. uh...

114
00:07:16.228 --> 00:07:18.856
...wrapping
someone's Christmas present.

115
00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:20.440
- Yes! What is it?

116
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.734
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.
Tell me. Tell me.

117
00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.528
Sorry. sport. Bedtime.

118
00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:26.071
Can I at least get a hint?

119
00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:29.783
Let's just say it's something
no future superhero

120
00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.285
should be without.

121
00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:33.287
- Is it a Bat-grappling gun?
- Nope.

122
00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:36.582
- Razor-lined Bat-gauntlets.
- Good gravy. No!

123
00:07:36.582 --> 00:07:38.625
- Bat-ice skates?
- Skates?

124
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.294
Now. that's just silly.

125
00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:43.297
Is it
a Bat-laser torch?

126
00:07:43.297 --> 00:07:44.298
No.

127
00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.304
Bat-cryptographer sequencer?

128
00:07:50.304 --> 00:07:52.222
I'm not even sure what that is.

129
00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.558
A heat-seeking
Bat-rocket launcher?

130
00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:57.561
Nope. And you guessed
that already. Twice.

131
00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:00.856
Master Wayne.

132
00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:03.025
stop playing with your
blood sausage.

133
00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:05.235
Right. yeah.
totally. Sorry. Alfred.

134
00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:07.988
Now. let's enjoy
the traditional

135
00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:10.365
Christmas Eve
breakfast of my youth.

136
00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:11.575
Best hurry.

137
00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:14.494
If jellied eel sits too
long. it tends to...

138
00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:16.622
congeal.

139
00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:21.084
Mm. Mm.

140
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.137
Mm.

141
00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:34.806
Donut tell anybody.

142
00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.850
Kapow!

143
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.227
<i>♪ Da-na-na-na-na-na ♪</i>

144
00:08:38.227 --> 00:08:41.063
And no cowls
at the table.

145
00:08:41.063 --> 00:08:43.607
Aw. come one.
It's Christmas Eve!

146
00:08:43.607 --> 00:08:45.442
Damian. you heard Alfred.

147
00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.243
Hmph.

148
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:57.246
Ah. what the heck?

149
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.249
Here you go. Damian.

150
00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:03.585
Whoa! You mean
I can open it now?

151
00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:05.963
Why not? You get
to stop guessing

152
00:09:05.963 --> 00:09:07.714
and I get to hear myself
think again.

153
00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.925
- It's a win-win.
- Mm-hm.

154
00:09:09.925 --> 00:09:11.677
Merry Christmas. kiddo.

155
00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:19.768
My own utility belt!

156
00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:22.813
Yeah. that was
my first utility belt. Damian.

157
00:09:22.813 --> 00:09:25.482
What? No way! Oh. man!
I can't believe it.

158
00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.818
This is the best. Dad!
You're the best!

159
00:09:27.818 --> 00:09:29.653
Alfred. isn't Dad the best?

160
00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:32.948
- Oh. my. Yes.

161
00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:34.741
This is indeed exciting.

162
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.576
Oh. what did you put
in the pouches?

163
00:09:40.122 --> 00:09:41.832
That's your Bat-first-aid kit.

164
00:09:41.832 --> 00:09:43.667
Oh. neat.

165
00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.252
How about this?

166
00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:47.004
Your Bat-mergency whistle.

167
00:09:47.004 --> 00:09:48.588
Nice.

168
00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:51.550
Which should only be used
in case of a Bat-mergency.

169
00:09:53.552 --> 00:09:56.346
{\an8}Whoa! A Batarang

170
00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:02.477
- It's foam.

171
00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:05.105
But isn't it supposed to fly
back to me.

172
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.440
So it can poke you in the eye?

173
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.607
I don't think so.

174
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.276
That's a practice Batarang.

175
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:14.323
Dad. don't get me wrong.
I love this belt.

176
00:10:14.323 --> 00:10:16.616
I mean. I love. love. love it.

177
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.285
But where's the. you know.

178
00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.203
cool stuff?

179
00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:21.288
You mean dangerous stuff?

180
00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:23.832
Damian. you'll have
to earn those things
when you're older.

181
00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.417
You still have a lot to learn.

182
00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:27.586
Oh. come on. Dad.
I'm not a baby.

183
00:10:27.586 --> 00:10:29.338
Hey. I never said
you were a baby.

184
00:10:29.338 --> 00:10:31.131
<i>Emergency! Call for help.</i>

185
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.799
<i>My precious little baby
is in danger.</i>

186
00:10:33.884 --> 00:10:35.719
I'll re-record that for you.

187
00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:40.307
Damian. this is the first step
toward becoming a superhero.

188
00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:42.434
Believe me.
I agonized for months

189
00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:43.810
over whether you're
ready for even--

190
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.937
- What's that?

191
00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:48.690
- It sounds like the--
- It can't be.

192
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.776
Can't be what?
What can't it be?

193
00:10:50.776 --> 00:10:52.235
The Batphone.

194
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.072
{\an8}Ooh. wait for me.
I'll put on my belt!

195
00:10:55.072 --> 00:10:56.740
I mean...

196
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.908
Wait for me.

197
00:10:57.908 --> 00:10:59.326
I'll put on my belt.

198
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:09.419
No one's called
this thing in years.

199
00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.713
Crime must be back
in Gotham.

200
00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.799
It's a Christmas miracle!

201
00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.009
- Hello?

202
00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.469
It's the Justice League.

203
00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:19.638
{\an8}What? Are you serious?

204
00:11:19.638 --> 00:11:20.972
Quick. How's my belt look?

205
00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:23.392
Uh-huh. No. I... I hear you.

206
00:11:23.392 --> 00:11:25.644
A weather anomaly?
In Nova Scotia?

207
00:11:25.644 --> 00:11:27.104
Just let Clark handle it.

208
00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:30.982
It's Christmas Eve.
We all have plans.

209
00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:33.735
No need to send Superman.
We got this.

210
00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.153
Sorry. that was Damian.

211
00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.114
Yeah. he's eight now.
Crazy. right?

212
00:11:37.823 --> 00:11:39.199
You can't call anyone else?

213
00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.367
How about the Twins?

214
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.285
- They're not talking?

215
00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:44.371
Well tell them to activate
their Wonder Twin powers

216
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.331
and form into mature adults.

217
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.084
All right. Fine.

218
00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:50.544
I'll leave in five.

219
00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:54.381
Sorry. Damian. I gotta go.

220
00:11:54.381 --> 00:11:57.551
But I promise I'll be back
before Christmas.

221
00:11:57.551 --> 00:11:59.010
Wait. Dad! Dad! Dad!

222
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.303
Let me come with you. Please!

223
00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:02.180
I don't think so. kiddo.

224
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.683
It could be your Christmas
gift for the next year.

225
00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:06.143
For the next ten years!

226
00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.354
I can't risk it.
The answer's no.

227
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.732
Mm.

228
00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.277
Good. Now. where's your
emergency contact list?

229
00:12:15.277 --> 00:12:16.319
Actually. never mind.

230
00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:17.904
I printed extra copies
for your belt.

231
00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:22.868
Okay. What do you do

232
00:12:22.868 --> 00:12:24.244
in the event
of a home invasion?

233
00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.328
Call the police.

234
00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:26.913
- Mental breakdown?
- Therapist.

235
00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:28.665
A race of giant.
super-intelligent

236
00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.208
fungus-beetles attack Gotham?

237
00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:32.210
{\an8}I don't know.
Call Commissioner Gordon?

238
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.171
Commiss-- What? No!

239
00:12:34.171 --> 00:12:36.047
All he ever does
is pass the buck to me.

240
00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:38.508
I'll be back before
you know it. buddy.

241
00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.846
I shall ready the Batjet.
Master Wayne.

242
00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:46.224
{\an8}Batjet. huh?

243
00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:03.492
You're making record time

244
00:13:03.492 --> 00:13:05.452
for not having done this
in years. Bruce.

245
00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.287
Did you program
the coordinates?

246
00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.206
And pre-heated
the seat warmer. sir.

247
00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:13.210
Shall I assume

248
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.880
we did not see the Bat-razor
I left on the vanity?

249
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.340
Really? The beard again?

250
00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:22.177
I like it. It totally ups
my intimidation game.

251
00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:27.807
{\an8}You have donut crumbs
in your intimidation game. sir.

252
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:30.936
- Hm.

253
00:13:30.936 --> 00:13:32.562
<i>Emergency! Call for help.</i>

254
00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.272
<i>My precious little baby
is in danger.</i>

255
00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.482
What the...

256
00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:39.402
<i>- Emergency! Call for help.</i>

257
00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:41.238
<i>- My precious little baby...</i>
- Come on.

258
00:13:41.238 --> 00:13:43.114
- Damian!

259
00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:44.574
Wow! Dad!

260
00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.619
You look awesome!

261
00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.454
Damian. get out of the bag.

262
00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:51.623
Come on. Dad. just let
me come with you.

263
00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:53.875
No. We don't have
time for this.

264
00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.460
You won't even know I'm here.

265
00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.711
I told you.

266
00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.381
- you're not ready.

267
00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:02.050
Ugh! Dad. look how hard
I've been training.

268
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.385
I mean. check out
my rad ninja skills.

269
00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:05.637
-  Get over here. Argh!

270
00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:08.598
Argh! My good hip.

271
00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.684
Oh. my gosh! Alfred!
I'm so sorry.

272
00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:14.145
Damian Thomas Wayne!
That is enough!

273
00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:18.692
I just thought

274
00:14:19.568 --> 00:14:20.819
getting your belt meant

275
00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:23.572
that I was ready to be
a superhero like you.

276
00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:25.407
Well. it didn't.

277
00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:27.576
In fact. give me the belt.

278
00:14:27.576 --> 00:14:29.786
You're clearly
not ready for it.

279
00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.830
What? Dad. no!

280
00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:33.832
Damian.

281
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:50.473
Hold on to this
until I get back.

282
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.560
Okay. Now give me a...

283
00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.229
goodbye hug?

284
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.239
He'll be fine. sir.
I'll see to that.

285
00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:09.409
I knew he wasn't ready
to have his own belt.

286
00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:12.871
Yes. Well.
I can certainly agree

287
00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:14.873
that "someone" wasn't ready.

288
00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:20.420
I gotta get going. Alfred.

289
00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.891
Godspeed. sir.

290
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.745
Come along. Damian.

291
00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:57.290
I've got just the thing
to lift your spirits.

292
00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.710
A steaming mug of my
world-famous hot cocoa.

293
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.796
With extra marshmallows.

294
00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:06.049
{\an8}Thanks. but coco's
kinda kid stuff.

295
00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:07.425
"Kid stuff?"

296
00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:09.719
Oh. your father
would disagree.

297
00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:12.847
I once saw him drink
an entire gallon
in one sitting.

298
00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:14.182
You did not.

299
00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:16.017
Did so.
And he had quite

300
00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.769
the swollen stomach
that evening.

301
00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:21.064
Why I had to take
the Batsuit out
an entire two inches

302
00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:22.774
before he could even
go out on patrol.

303
00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:46.089
This is so unfair. Selina.

304
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.344
You're right. I can't give up.

305
00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:54.305
I'll work even harder
to prove I'm ready
to be Batman.

306
00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:56.808
And you know what that means?

307
00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:59.769
{\an8}Time for some extreme training.

308
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.025
Unsupervised
extreme training.

309
00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:12.615
I don't know. Alfred.

310
00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:15.285
Do you really think
a steaming mug

311
00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:17.287
of your world-famous
hot cocoa

312
00:17:17.287 --> 00:17:19.706
with extra marshmallows
could help?

313
00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:22.041
Why I'm certain of it. sir.

314
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:24.711
Unless it's too much trouble.

315
00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:26.504
Nonsense. Coming up.

316
00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:34.179
All right. Pennyworth.
time to deliver your A-game.

317
00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:48.318
Aw. man!

318
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.164
Hm.

319
00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:03.583
Hmph.

320
00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:24.229
And now
the piece de resistance.

321
00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:29.150
Good heavens!
Out of marshmallows?

322
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.485
- What?

323
00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:32.237
How did that happen?

324
00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:35.490
This is catastrophic.

325
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.908
That's okay.

326
00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:38.159
After all. it's...

327
00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:40.453
it's only cocoa
without marshmallows.

328
00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.581
It's not like
it's Christmas Eve

329
00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:44.707
without my...

330
00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:46.125
...dad.

331
00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:57.095
Fear not.

332
00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:59.597
I shall return
before your cocoa

333
00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:01.349
even has a chance to cool.

334
00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:06.938
You sure?
You really don't need to.

335
00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:08.857
but if you insist.
Hurry back. Okay. bye.

336
00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.694
And now. time to train

337
00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:14.445
for I am...

338
00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:16.364
the Night!

339
00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:19.033
Night. Night.

340
00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:21.536
Night. Night...

341
00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:34.007
{\an8}Oh. biscuits!

342
00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:39.012
I beg your pardon.

343
00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:42.974
Hey. watch where
you're going. grandpa!

344
00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:46.227
There's some real psychos

361
00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:54.212
I don't need some trip
to Nova Scotia.

362
00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:57.465
This is the best
Christmas Eve ever!

363
00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.384
Ever! Ever!

364
00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:02.387
I haven't determined the cause
of the Batjet malfunction.

365
00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:04.305
but there's no anomaly up here.

366
00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:06.307
In fact.
it's a perfectly typical

367
00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:08.351
- Nova Scotia blizzard!

368
00:21:11.854 --> 00:21:13.773
What do you mean.
"What anomaly." J'onn?

369
00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.984
If you didn't send me here.
who did?

370
00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:18.444
Ugh!

371
00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:20.530
- Oh. no. Hello?

372
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.865
J'onzz? Hello!

373
00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:25.493
Great.

374
00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:28.454
I can't miss Christmas.

375
00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:31.833
Damian. I'm coming!

376
00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:44.053
Please. why are you doing this?

377
00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:46.556
Yeah. It's Christmas.
you monster.

378
00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:49.267
I'm just making
some Christmas memories.

379
00:21:49.851 --> 00:21:51.060
Say. "Cheese."

380
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.563
Ugh! Stop it with the videos.

381
00:21:53.563 --> 00:21:56.566
What? Is it a crime
to document our crimes.

382
00:21:56.566 --> 00:21:58.234
Just throw
the goods in the van.

383
00:21:58.234 --> 00:21:59.527
- you idiot!

384
00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:01.279
We've got a lot
of mansions to hit.

385
00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:09.120
And now. the most important
part of training.

386
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.040
the post-workout carbo load.

387
00:22:16.461 --> 00:22:17.712
It's good.

388
00:22:17.712 --> 00:22:21.632
But it could have a bit more
turbo charge.

389
00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:34.353
I survived an explosion.

390
00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:36.147
Again.

391
00:22:50.495 --> 00:22:53.539
This neighborhood's
prime for the picking.

392
00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:54.916
Which house
do you want to hit next?

393
00:23:00.046 --> 00:23:01.380
That one will do.

394
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.757
So big.

395
00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:14.977
Oh. man.
Alfred's back already?

396
00:23:18.981 --> 00:23:21.275
Ah. we've hit a gold mine.

397
00:23:21.275 --> 00:23:23.569
Looks like no one's home.

398
00:23:24.153 --> 00:23:26.614
Will you shut up and help me.
you ding-dong?

399
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:29.242
Burglars!

400
00:23:30.535 --> 00:23:32.912
Oh. no. What do I do?
What do I do?

401
00:23:39.085 --> 00:23:40.795
Okay. Damian. calm down.

402
00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:42.588
Think. It's just
a home invasion.

403
00:23:42.588 --> 00:23:43.965
A home invasion?

404
00:23:43.965 --> 00:23:46.592
Dad never told me what to do
in case of one of these.

405
00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:50.638
Ugh! What is this?
Bulletproof glass?

406
00:23:50.638 --> 00:23:51.848
- Here. I've got it.
- No. no. no!

407
00:23:57.687 --> 00:23:58.521
Ugh!

408
00:23:59.188 --> 00:24:01.065
<i>Emergency...</i>
- Not now. Come on. turn off.

409
00:24:01.065 --> 00:24:02.233
- Turn off.
<i>- ...my baby is in--</i>

410
00:24:10.616 --> 00:24:11.617
Told you I had it.

411
00:24:17.165 --> 00:24:20.251
Terry. I think
we hit the jackpot.

412
00:24:20.251 --> 00:24:21.419
Cha-ching.

413
00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:24.964
What have I told you
about that stupid phone?

414
00:24:24.964 --> 00:24:27.133
What? Uh-oh.

415
00:24:27.133 --> 00:24:29.385
-  Ouch! I bit my tongue.

416
00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:33.931
Ah. there's so much stuff.

417
00:24:33.931 --> 00:24:36.559
How are we gonna fit all
this junk inside the van?

418
00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:38.769
We'll just grab what we can
and get a move on.

419
00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:40.813
The boss doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

420
00:24:40.813 --> 00:24:42.106
Yeah. that's true.

421
00:24:42.106 --> 00:24:43.900
Remember what happened
to the last bloke?

422
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.276
Ugh! Don't remind me.

423
00:24:45.276 --> 00:24:46.903
I can still hear his screams.

424
00:24:49.697 --> 00:24:51.866
{\an8}Hang on. Selina.
I'm calling for help.

425
00:24:52.575 --> 00:24:54.493
Police.

426
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.872
<i>Gotham City Police.
How can I help you?</i>

427
00:24:57.872 --> 00:25:00.458
Check out this cool belt.

428
00:25:02.126 --> 00:25:04.378
You think I could
rock something like this?

429
00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:06.797
Just throw it in the bag.
you idiot.

430
00:25:06.797 --> 00:25:07.840
Yeah. okay.

431
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.383
I'm gonna try you on...

432
00:25:09.383 --> 00:25:13.262
...later.

433
00:25:13.262 --> 00:25:15.514
No!

434
00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:23.481
They can't take my belt.

435
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:25.316
{\an8}Dad already thinks
I'm not ready for it.

436
00:25:25.316 --> 00:25:27.902
{\an8}It'll be years before
he trusts me with another one.

437
00:25:29.487 --> 00:25:31.447
{\an8}Unless I get it back myself.

438
00:25:31.447 --> 00:25:34.200
{\an8}then Dad would see that
I am ready to be a superhero.

439
00:25:34.951 --> 00:25:36.577
<i>Hello?
What's the emergency?</i>

440
00:25:36.577 --> 00:25:37.912
<i>Is anyone injured?</i>

441
00:25:37.912 --> 00:25:40.790
No. But they will be.

442
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.124
-  <i>Hello?</i>

443
00:25:44.794 --> 00:25:46.337
- Come on. Selina.

444
00:25:46.337 --> 00:25:48.923
-  You hear something?

445
00:26:00.101 --> 00:26:04.146
{\an8}Man. they wasted
a lot of moolah
on a bunch of dumb books.

446
00:26:04.146 --> 00:26:07.733
There's a whole shelf
on excavating shale rock
from underneath manors.

447
00:26:08.693 --> 00:26:10.027
That's weirdly specific.

448
00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:13.155
Hasn't anyone ever told you

449
00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:14.949
to be quiet in a library?

450
00:26:25.751 --> 00:26:27.628
{\an8}Give me back my belt.

451
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:31.465
Okay. you have got
to be kidding me.

452
00:26:31.465 --> 00:26:33.676
Now. this
I've got to get.

453
00:26:33.676 --> 00:26:35.720
Nice entrance. kid.

454
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.179
What are you supposed to be?

455
00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:38.639
{\an8}I'm Batman.

456
00:26:38.639 --> 00:26:41.976
{\an8}And your night just got
a whole lot darker.

457
00:26:42.935 --> 00:26:45.229
All right. Come here. kid.

458
00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:47.189
Where did he go?

459
00:26:47.189 --> 00:26:48.232
Peek-a-boo!

460
00:26:50.318 --> 00:26:52.945
- Ugh. just my luck.

461
00:26:52.945 --> 00:26:54.780
Okay. you little brat.

462
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.115
You had your fun.

463
00:26:56.115 --> 00:26:58.326
Uh. I can't see anything.

464
00:26:58.326 --> 00:27:00.161
You can even
say you're blind

465
00:27:00.161 --> 00:27:01.287
as a bat.

466
00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:03.289
- What was that?
- What's going on?

467
00:27:05.541 --> 00:27:06.375
<i>Adios.</i>

468
00:27:07.293 --> 00:27:09.253
Get over here.
you little turdmuffin!

469
00:27:12.423 --> 00:27:15.384
I'm gonna
tear that bat's wings off.

470
00:27:15.384 --> 00:27:16.886
Is that all you got?

471
00:27:19.263 --> 00:27:20.264
Uh-oh.

472
00:27:28.022 --> 00:27:29.482
Argh!

473
00:27:31.484 --> 00:27:33.027
I'm gonna puke.

474
00:27:43.704 --> 00:27:45.498
I'm over here. bozos!

475
00:27:45.498 --> 00:27:47.833
Come and get me.

476
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:50.252
I'm gonna deck the halls
with this kid.

477
00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:00.763
Ha!

478
00:28:13.359 --> 00:28:14.485
What the...

479
00:28:14.485 --> 00:28:15.778
A kiddy pool?

480
00:28:15.778 --> 00:28:18.322
That's to put out
the grease fire.

481
00:28:18.322 --> 00:28:20.491
Water doesn't put out
grease fires.

482
00:28:20.491 --> 00:28:21.951
Exactly.

483
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.731
Is that our...

484
00:29:01.115 --> 00:29:03.200
Ugh! Congealed eel?

485
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.994
That's it! I've had it!

486
00:29:04.994 --> 00:29:06.787
Grab what you can.
We're out of here.

487
00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:10.207
Load up. I'll start the van.

488
00:29:12.042 --> 00:29:14.211
- Let it go. kid.

489
00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:16.881
Give me back my utility belt.

490
00:29:16.881 --> 00:29:19.216
You mean my utility belt?

491
00:29:20.718 --> 00:29:22.970
<i>Emergency! Call for help.</i>

492
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.889
<i>- My precious little baby is...</i>
- There it is.

493
00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:28.476
Ugh!

494
00:29:29.602 --> 00:29:30.686
Will you hurry up?

495
00:29:33.439 --> 00:29:35.900
- Stop! Get back here.

496
00:29:39.403 --> 00:29:40.237
Later. kid.

497
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.743
Now. you're gonna feel
my ninja skills.

498
00:29:45.743 --> 00:29:47.203
This kid
just won't quit.

499
00:29:47.203 --> 00:29:48.454
Oh. that's no kid.

500
00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:52.416
That's some kind
of feral mutant.

501
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.376
Whoa!

502
00:29:55.252 --> 00:29:57.379
Oh. no!
The boss is gonna kill us.

503
00:29:57.379 --> 00:29:59.798
Now you've got nothing.

504
00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:02.176
Oh. I wouldn't say nothing.

505
00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:04.386
Whoa!

506
00:30:05.262 --> 00:30:06.597
I got your belt.

507
00:30:06.597 --> 00:30:08.599
You lose. kid.

508
00:30:17.233 --> 00:30:18.108
Hm?

509
00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:20.027
{\an8}Whoa!

510
00:30:24.365 --> 00:30:28.369
{\an8}My belt may be gone.
but this is far from over.

511
00:30:28.369 --> 00:30:30.454
I will have vengeance.

512
00:30:30.454 --> 00:30:32.414
Because they didn't
cross some kid.

513
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.917
They crossed Batman's kid!

514
00:30:46.637 --> 00:30:49.306
Sorry. Selina.
but you can't come.

515
00:30:49.306 --> 00:30:51.350
This is gonna be
way too dangerous.

516
00:30:52.434 --> 00:30:54.228
Once I pass through
these doors.

517
00:30:54.228 --> 00:30:56.522
the Damian you knew
will be no more.

518
00:30:56.522 --> 00:30:58.148
I know. you're scared for me.

519
00:30:58.148 --> 00:31:00.526
And honestly.
I'm a little scared. too.

520
00:31:01.235 --> 00:31:02.403
- But...

521
00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:04.697
Oh.

522
00:31:06.657 --> 00:31:08.325

Let's see
that ice cream truck

526
00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:34.787
outrun this sick set
of wheels.

527
00:32:35.788 --> 00:32:37.623
Oh.
what do we have here?

528
00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:47.383
Huh...

529
00:32:48.425 --> 00:32:49.468
It's a bit saggy.

530
00:32:52.012 --> 00:32:54.890
Well. that one just leaves
nothing to the imagination.

531
00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:08.737
What's this?

532
00:33:14.827 --> 00:33:16.412
{\an8}No way.

533
00:33:26.714 --> 00:33:28.340
Dad made me a Batsuit.

534
00:33:33.762 --> 00:33:34.888
Awesome.

535
00:33:38.726 --> 00:33:41.603
{\an8}Whoa! Wait until
they get a load of me.

536
00:33:42.271 --> 00:33:44.523
<i>Damian. It's Dad.</i>

537
00:33:44.523 --> 00:33:45.733
Dad?

538
00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:48.902
<i>If you're wearing that suit.
it means I am dead.</i>

539
00:33:48.902 --> 00:33:50.779
<i>and my worst fear
has come true.</i>

540
00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:52.281
<i>Crime is back in Gotham.</i>

541
00:33:53.115 --> 00:33:55.367
<i>And now you must take my place
and become...</i>

542
00:33:56.326 --> 00:33:57.244
<i>the Batman.</i>

543
00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.456
<i>Unless you broke into
the Batcave
and stole the suit.</i>

544
00:34:00.456 --> 00:34:04.126
<i>in which case you're
in big trouble. mister.
You just wait till I get home.</i>

545
00:34:04.126 --> 00:34:05.127
Yikes.

546
00:34:06.128 --> 00:34:09.715
<i>By now. I'd already
given you the utility belt
that goes with your suit.</i>

547
00:34:09.715 --> 00:34:13.051
<i>That Batsuit is the most
technologically advanced yet.</i>

548
00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:14.303
Heck. yeah.

549
00:34:14.303 --> 00:34:16.013
<i>But before we get
into that tech.</i>

550
00:34:16.013 --> 00:34:18.098
<i>there's a few things
your father would like
to share with you.</i>

551
00:34:18.098 --> 00:34:19.767
<i>in case we never
got the chance.</i>

552
00:34:19.767 --> 00:34:21.185
<i>Like when I met your mom.</i>

553
00:34:21.185 --> 00:34:23.520
<i>Damian. your mother
was a total smokeshow.</i>

554
00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.398
How do you
fast forward this thing?

555
00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:28.525
<i>- ...Sugar Moose.
- </i>

556
00:34:28.525 --> 00:34:29.693
<i>...you might be
getting to that age</i>

557
00:34:29.693 --> 00:34:32.070
<i>where your body
is going through
some changes...</i>

558
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.489
Ugh! Gross.

559
00:34:36.617 --> 00:34:38.243
<i>You gotta be careful. Damian.</i>

560
00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:42.915
<i>Oh. Alfred.
the diaper's integrity.
it's been compromised.</i>

561
00:34:42.915 --> 00:34:45.501
<i>- I need wipes...</i>
- Ah. Dad.

562
00:34:48.253 --> 00:34:49.963
<i>...and though I'd won
the brutal fight.</i>

563
00:34:49.963 --> 00:34:53.300
<i>the searing pain
of the injuries I sustained
are still with me.</i>

564
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.301
<i>Every day.</i>

565
00:34:55.594 --> 00:34:57.387
<i>Okay. so. onto the Batsuit.</i>

566
00:34:57.387 --> 00:34:58.555
Yeah!

567
00:34:58.555 --> 00:35:02.726
<i>To be honest. Damian.
part of me never wanted you
to have to put that suit on.</i>

568
00:35:02.726 --> 00:35:05.103
<i>But another part of me
always knew deep down</i>

569
00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:07.606
<i>that this is what
you were born to do.</i>

570
00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:11.276
<i>My only regret
is not being by your side
when you did it.</i>

571
00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:14.154
<i>Thankfully. that's where
the suit's tech comes in.</i>

572
00:35:14.154 --> 00:35:18.534
<i>With the help of AI.
I've programmed myself
into the suit.</i>

573
00:35:18.534 --> 00:35:20.744
<i>Activating Bat-Dad.</i>

574
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:32.172
<i>Upload complete.</i>

575
00:35:33.382 --> 00:35:35.551
<i>Okay. Good luck. Damian.</i>

576
00:35:35.551 --> 00:35:38.637
<i>And remember.
I'll be with you always.</i>

577
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:41.306
<i>Ending transmission.</i>

578
00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:42.349

Bat-Dad online.
Hello. Damian.

582
00:35:56.405 --> 00:35:59.741
{\an8}Wow. you can talk? Cool.

583
00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:02.744
{\an8}Uh... computer. status report.

00:36:02.744 --> 00:36:04.580
Please. call me Bat-Dad.

585
00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:08.500
Bio scans indicate
you are eight years
and four days old.

586
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.003
Recommendation.
time for night-night.

587
00:36:11.003 --> 00:36:14.256
{\an8}Great. It's just as overbearing
as the real thing.

588
00:36:14.256 --> 00:36:16.592
Would you like me
to read you a story?

589
00:36:16.592 --> 00:36:18.010
{\an8}No. thank you.

590
00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:22.180
My memory matrix says
I would often read <i>Happy
Puppy's First Day of School.</i>

591
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.099
We don't have time for this.
Bat-Dad.

592
00:36:24.099 --> 00:36:26.351
I have it downloaded
in six languages.

593
00:36:26.351 --> 00:36:28.604
Mute. mute. mute!

594
00:36:28.604 --> 00:36:31.273
It sounds like
you'd like to mute
your dead father.

595
00:36:31.273 --> 00:36:33.191
Would you like to mute
your dead father?

596
00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:36.945
{\an8}No. I mean. yes.
but my dad isn't...

597
00:36:38.113 --> 00:36:39.615
Just mute. please.

598
00:36:39.615 --> 00:36:41.700
No mute function found.

599
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.035
Then why did you just offer?

600
00:36:52.252 --> 00:36:53.837
Whoa!

601
00:36:55.464 --> 00:36:57.466
{\an8}Awesome.

602
00:36:57.466 --> 00:36:59.301
I'm not
detecting a car seat.

603
00:36:59.301 --> 00:37:01.845
Safety guidelines recommend
children under ten--

604
00:37:01.845 --> 00:37:04.806
Can we just focus?
I need to get my belt back.

605
00:37:04.806 --> 00:37:06.767
Affirmative.
The ability to focus

606
00:37:06.767 --> 00:37:09.353
is a quality
every good superhero
must possess.

607
00:37:09.353 --> 00:37:10.646
Uh-huh. yep. thanks.

608
00:37:10.646 --> 00:37:13.523
But I already know
the qualities
of a good superhero.

609
00:37:13.523 --> 00:37:16.068
Excellent.
Would you care to review?

610
00:37:16.068 --> 00:37:18.612
Focus. responsibility.
sacrifice--

611
00:37:18.612 --> 00:37:20.322
Please. just stop talking.

612
00:37:20.322 --> 00:37:22.449
Now let's drive this car.

613
00:37:43.929 --> 00:37:45.597
Come on. go.

614
00:37:45.597 --> 00:37:48.809

What do you think
is in the vats?

636
00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:26.490
Probably us.
We had one job and we blew it.

637
00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.909
Now we've got to meet
the boss empty handed.

638
00:39:29.743 --> 00:39:31.787
We are in so much trouble.

639
00:39:31.787 --> 00:39:34.873
Relax. We're not
completely empty handed.

640
00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:36.249
Let me do the talking.

641
00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:42.672
On second thoughts.
you do the talking.

642
00:39:46.676 --> 00:39:49.429
Hello. sir. You in here?

643
00:39:49.429 --> 00:39:54.101
My associate and I were
just saying what
a lovely hideout you...

644
00:39:56.978 --> 00:39:59.189
have... here.

645
00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:10.450
Well. if it isn't my two
favorite new henchmen.
Roscoe and Whatchamacallit.

646
00:40:11.326 --> 00:40:14.371
Um... she's Francine. and I'm--

647
00:40:14.371 --> 00:40:17.249
Good evening. Mr. Joker. sir.

648
00:40:17.249 --> 00:40:20.127
You two are looking
a little worse for wear.

649
00:40:20.127 --> 00:40:24.422
Hopefully that's a sign
you did your part
in my a master plan for Gotham.

650
00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:28.301
Oh. how I want to make this
a very special Christmas Eve.

651
00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:30.595
Oh. yeah. we had a blast.

652
00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:32.597
You should have seen
this one bloke. he was like--

653
00:40:32.597 --> 00:40:35.600
I'm sorry if I gave
the impression I cared.

654
00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.562
Now then.
what do you got for me?

655
00:40:38.562 --> 00:40:42.190
Oh. what do we got?
Oh. sure. uh...

656
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:43.900
Why don't you go ahead
and do that. Terry.

657
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.235
since you're kind of
spearheading that?

658
00:40:45.235 --> 00:40:48.113
No. no. you do the honors. Francine.

659
00:40:48.113 --> 00:40:49.573
You do it.

660
00:40:49.573 --> 00:40:51.158
It wasn't me who lost the loot.

661
00:40:51.158 --> 00:40:53.952
I wouldn't have
dropped the loot
if you'd driven straight

662
00:40:54.077 --> 00:40:56.163
instead of being scared by
a two-year-old.

663
00:40:56.163 --> 00:40:57.205
He was at least
four and a half.

664
00:40:57.205 --> 00:40:59.875
Just give it to me.
Gimme. gimme. gimme!

665
00:40:59.875 --> 00:41:02.210
Gimme. gimme. gimme.
gimme. gimme. gimme.

666
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.713
Uh... here you go. boss.

667
00:41:08.383 --> 00:41:09.426
What's happening here?

668
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:11.094
Where's the rest?

669
00:41:11.094 --> 00:41:15.015
That. actually. is the rest.
Mr. Joker. Sir.

670
00:41:15.015 --> 00:41:18.143
You've been out all day
and you just bring me this?

671
00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.315
{\an8}Of all the elves I had
do my Christmas bidding.

672
00:41:23.315 --> 00:41:26.610
{\an8}I gave you two
the poshest neighborhood.

673
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:29.029
We had more. Lots more.

674
00:41:29.029 --> 00:41:33.950
But then we ran into
a number of unforeseen.
unfortunate--

675
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:34.868
It was Batman.

676
00:41:34.868 --> 00:41:38.955
Batman? Impossible.
I tricked him into
leaving Gotham.

677
00:41:38.955 --> 00:41:42.542
Oh. even after
all these years apart.
he still ruins everything.

678
00:41:42.542 --> 00:41:46.463
How can he be everywhere
at the same time?
All at once. all the time?

679
00:41:46.463 --> 00:41:48.423
I'm so sick
of these Batman games.

680
00:41:50.425 --> 00:41:52.636
No. it was a little Batman.

681
00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:55.347
Little Batman?

682
00:41:55.347 --> 00:41:57.432
What. did he shrink
or something? Hm?

683
00:41:57.432 --> 00:42:00.227
What Terry is trying
to say is--

684
00:42:00.227 --> 00:42:02.520
So. there was this little kid
dressed up as Batman.

685
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.523
He beat the crud out of us
in a surprisingly
skillful manner.

686
00:42:06.691 --> 00:42:08.693
And it was all
because of that belt.

687
00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:11.780
He went berserk for it.

688
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.871
So. let me get this straight.

689
00:42:19.871 --> 00:42:22.874
You're telling me
you two were beat by
a child in a...

690
00:42:22.874 --> 00:42:24.876
{\an8} Batman costume?

691
00:42:24.876 --> 00:42:28.463
More like PJs
and a paper-bag mask.

692
00:42:28.463 --> 00:42:30.131
There you go. See for yourself.

693
00:42:32.217 --> 00:42:33.635
<i>I'm afraid of the dark.</i>

694
00:42:33.635 --> 00:42:35.720
<i>- What was that?
- What's going on?</i>

695
00:42:38.974 --> 00:42:41.977
Ooh. my. Look at that
little hellion go.

696
00:42:41.977 --> 00:42:44.271
And such rad ninja skills.

697
00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:48.900
Whoa! Was that a grease fire?
So clever.

698
00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.570
How do you rewind this thing?
Okay. okay. here it is.

699
00:42:53.947 --> 00:42:57.242
Oh. he really fried you
like a couple of
chicken fingers.

700
00:42:57.242 --> 00:43:00.036
Okay. okay.
One more time.

701
00:43:05.875 --> 00:43:08.003
This child is sensational.

702
00:43:08.003 --> 00:43:10.630
<i>Give me my belt.</i>

703
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.216
I was only planning
to steal Christmas.

704
00:43:13.216 --> 00:43:16.469
But after watching
this kid's work.
it's all so clear.

705
00:43:16.469 --> 00:43:19.014
Why would we just
steal Gotham's Christmas

706
00:43:19.014 --> 00:43:23.852
when it would be
so much more festive
to destroy it?

707
00:43:23.852 --> 00:43:25.020
And who better to do it

708
00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:29.941
than a merry little Batman?

709
00:43:39.868 --> 00:43:41.411
What do you have in mind. boss?

710
00:43:42.162 --> 00:43:43.121
Are you still here?

711
00:43:49.085 --> 00:43:50.628
Can I at least
have my phone?

712
00:43:56.426 --> 00:43:59.512
<i>Give me my belt.</i>

713
00:43:59.512 --> 00:44:03.224
My. how the little cherub
wants his toy belt back.

714
00:44:06.603 --> 00:44:08.355
Did I miss
all the fun?

715
00:44:08.355 --> 00:44:11.566
No. In fact. thanks
to this stocking stuffer.

716
00:44:11.566 --> 00:44:13.109
the real fun is about to begin.

717
00:44:13.943 --> 00:44:16.446
Sounds divine.

718
00:44:19.157 --> 00:44:23.870
Now. if I were a kid
looking for my toy.
where would I look?

719
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.121
Hm.

720
00:44:25.121 --> 00:44:26.664
Of course.

721
00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:31.795
{\an8}Or should I say. "Ho. ho. ho."

722
00:44:42.555 --> 00:44:45.558
Looking for those scum this way
is taking too long.

723
00:44:45.558 --> 00:44:48.353
Bat-Dad. don't you have
some kind of secret
surveillance system?

724
00:44:48.353 --> 00:44:50.647
You know. one that can
tap into everyone's cell phones

725
00:44:50.647 --> 00:44:52.023
and give us eyes everywhere?

726
00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:53.817
Aha. I'm sorry.

727
00:44:53.817 --> 00:44:56.903
That would be
an egregious violation
of basic privacy.

728
00:44:56.903 --> 00:45:00.073
No one should be allowed
to have eyes and ears everywhere.

729
00:45:00.073 --> 00:45:03.701
{\an8}Lucky for us.
someone already does.

730
00:45:08.581 --> 00:45:10.375
Santa Claus.

731
00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:12.919
You should get a picture.
Alfred would love that.

732
00:45:12.919 --> 00:45:16.005
No pictures. only justice.

733
00:45:18.675 --> 00:45:22.345
Oh. man.
I'm the worst dad ever.

734
00:45:22.345 --> 00:45:25.390
And I'm not racking up
any superhero points. either.

735
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:29.561
Anomaly.
Come on. Bruce.
Walked right into that one.

736
00:45:29.561 --> 00:45:32.188
I mean. this is textbook
supervillain stuff.

737
00:45:32.188 --> 00:45:35.108
Step one. get Batman
out of town.

738
00:45:35.108 --> 00:45:39.237
Step two. unleash an evil plot
and threaten Gotham
and all its people.

739
00:45:39.946 --> 00:45:41.531
All its people...

740
00:45:41.531 --> 00:45:46.703
Damian! Great. like that kid
doesn't find a way
to find trouble on his own.

741
00:45:47.287 --> 00:45:50.457
I mean. by now he probably...

742
00:45:52.041 --> 00:45:53.877
Dad. help me.

743
00:45:53.877 --> 00:45:55.962
Dad. I need you.

744
00:45:55.962 --> 00:45:59.007
Damian! I'll see you
in the Promised Land.

745
00:46:00.216 --> 00:46:01.551
Alfred. no...

746
00:46:02.719 --> 00:46:03.720
Ahh. no!

747
00:46:05.013 --> 00:46:06.389
Don't go there.

748
00:46:06.389 --> 00:46:08.892
Remember what
your therapist said
about your brooding?

749
00:46:08.892 --> 00:46:11.644
Just focus
on the repair. Brucey.

750
00:46:12.645 --> 00:46:14.147
Let's see what we got.

751
00:46:16.191 --> 00:46:18.318
Yep. that's what I thought.

752
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:20.153
Freeze.

753
00:46:34.209 --> 00:46:35.710
Whoa!

754
00:46:42.675 --> 00:46:44.636
Look at all these toys.

755
00:46:52.602 --> 00:46:55.396
Happy holidays.

756
00:47:00.401 --> 00:47:03.488
- Donut eat it all at once.

757
00:47:04.948 --> 00:47:05.990
Donuts.

758
00:47:09.577 --> 00:47:13.623
{\an8}Focus on the belt.
I am the night.
I am the night.

759
00:47:17.168 --> 00:47:19.087
Excuse me. citizen of Gotham.

760
00:47:19.087 --> 00:47:22.549
Uh-oh. Looks like
someone got their holidays
mixed up.

761
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:24.092
It's not Halloween. silly.

762
00:47:24.092 --> 00:47:26.094
Santa Claus. Where is he?

763
00:47:26.094 --> 00:47:29.556
Why. jolly old St. Nick's
up in his North Pole workshop.
of course.

764
00:47:29.556 --> 00:47:30.974
Located in our toy department.

765
00:47:33.768 --> 00:47:35.770
The escalators
are right over there.

766
00:47:45.446 --> 00:47:47.115
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

767
00:47:52.495 --> 00:47:55.123
It's your turn. little bat boy.

768
00:47:55.999 --> 00:47:58.084
Whoo-hoo. Santa!

769
00:47:59.919 --> 00:48:02.505
I don't have time
to get into anything
on my Christmas list.

770
00:48:02.505 --> 00:48:06.259
Like a new pair of
titanium Bat-cuffs
or some Bat-Cloaking gear.

771
00:48:06.259 --> 00:48:08.678
or this really cool pneumatic
Bat-Grenade launcher

772
00:48:08.678 --> 00:48:09.762
that comes with the laser scope

773
00:48:09.762 --> 00:48:11.472
and the glow-in-the-dark
Bat-symbols.

774
00:48:18.688 --> 00:48:20.523
I need information. Santa.

775
00:48:23.401 --> 00:48:24.736
Wait a minute.

776
00:48:25.528 --> 00:48:26.988
You're not Santa.

777
00:48:26.988 --> 00:48:27.989
Sure. he is.

778
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:31.659
Hello.

779
00:48:31.659 --> 00:48:37.081
How else could he possibly
know what you really
want for Christmas?

780
00:48:38.958 --> 00:48:40.752
Wait. How did you...

781
00:48:42.253 --> 00:48:43.630
Poison Ivy!

782
00:48:44.547 --> 00:48:48.217
And you must be... Bane.

783
00:48:48.217 --> 00:48:50.887
Come get your little belt.
Bat-Mite.

784
00:48:51.721 --> 00:48:53.348
Give me that back.

785
00:49:07.236 --> 00:49:08.071
Terrific.

786
00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:12.241
Observation.
The collateral damage
you are causing

787
00:49:12.241 --> 00:49:13.242
is putting you and others--

788
00:49:13.242 --> 00:49:15.078
I can't stop now.
If I get my belt back.

789
00:49:15.078 --> 00:49:17.538
I'll prove that
I'm ready to be a superhero.

790
00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:27.131
Huh.

791
00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:32.720
Works every time.

792
00:49:33.262 --> 00:49:34.097
Whoa!

793
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:38.559
I picked something up for you
in the garden section.

794
00:49:43.356 --> 00:49:44.190
My foliage.

795
00:49:46.317 --> 00:49:47.568
Finally.

796
00:49:55.368 --> 00:49:57.995
Not yet.
Remember what Joker said.

797
00:49:57.995 --> 00:50:01.791
We have to let
the little disaster artist
work his magic first.

798
00:50:09.382 --> 00:50:10.508
No!

799
00:50:14.262 --> 00:50:16.013
Why... does... Santa...

800
00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:17.890
need so many... reindeer?

801
00:50:25.481 --> 00:50:26.566
Whoa. whoa!

802
00:50:38.703 --> 00:50:39.704
-  What's going on?

803
00:50:39.704 --> 00:50:41.956
-  You okay. kid?
-  It's a freaking bat.

804
00:50:41.956 --> 00:50:44.959
It's okay. citizens.
I... I'm a super...

805
00:50:53.676 --> 00:50:54.844
Oh. no.

806
00:51:07.231 --> 00:51:08.274
Hey. watch it.

807
00:51:32.381 --> 00:51:35.802
{\an8}Bat-Dad. bring up directions
to the Gotham Zoo.

808
00:51:35.802 --> 00:51:36.969
{\an8}<i>Moments ago.</i>

809
00:51:36.969 --> 00:51:39.639
{\an8}<i>a tiny. masked figure
single handedly perpetrated</i>

810
00:51:39.639 --> 00:51:44.143
{\an8}<i>the most odious act
of yuletide vandalism
this city has ever seen.</i>

811
00:51:44.143 --> 00:51:47.563
{\an8}<i>I spoke to a concerned citizen
who had this to say.</i>

812
00:51:48.356 --> 00:51:50.316
{\an8}<i>I'm concerned.</i>

813
00:51:50.316 --> 00:51:52.652
{\an8}<i>Who was this
snack-sized scrooge?</i>

814
00:51:52.652 --> 00:51:55.363
{\an8}<i>And why did he have to
ruin it for everybody?</i>

815
00:51:55.363 --> 00:51:57.490
{\an8}<i>Those questions
remain unanswered.</i>

816
00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:00.910
{\an8}<i>But this home grown Gothamite
will only say this:</i>

817
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:03.663
<i>Humbug to you.
you little menace.</i>

818
00:52:03.663 --> 00:52:07.667
<i>Wherever you are.
it'll take more than
knocking down our tree</i>

819
00:52:07.667 --> 00:52:10.002
<i>to ruin this city's
Christmas spirit.</i>

820
00:52:10.002 --> 00:52:13.172
<i>Not mine. I love that tree.</i>

821
00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:17.510
What a genius.

822
00:52:19.762 --> 00:52:22.723
He's an absolute miniature
maestro of mayhem.

823
00:52:22.723 --> 00:52:25.852
He's exceeded
my wildest expectations.

824
00:52:25.852 --> 00:52:29.438
and he's playing into
my plan perfectly.

825
00:52:33.025 --> 00:52:33.985
Talk to me.

826
00:52:33.985 --> 00:52:36.612
The kid's belt
was delivered to the bird
as planned?

827
00:52:36.612 --> 00:52:38.364
Fantastic.

828
00:52:38.364 --> 00:52:42.326
I'm gonna bring a sleigh
full of Christmas chaos
to his next stop.

829
00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.541
But. you know...

830
00:52:49.876 --> 00:52:54.255
I'm curious to see
just how much more damage
our little dynamo could cause.

831
00:52:54.255 --> 00:52:56.424
if properly motivated.

832
00:52:58.134 --> 00:53:02.013
Yes. it's time
for the boy and I to tango.

833
00:53:05.808 --> 00:53:07.143
- But...

834
00:53:07.143 --> 00:53:08.644
Huh? I don't wanna waltz.

835
00:53:08.644 --> 00:53:10.187
It's... it's an expression.

836
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:12.273
Never mind.
I wanna talk to the kid.

837
00:53:15.359 --> 00:53:18.112
That does it.
I'm moving to Metropolis.

838
00:53:28.873 --> 00:53:32.043
I know you're out here.
Show yourself.

839
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.635
Victor.

840
00:53:41.886 --> 00:53:46.015
Tonight's forecast.
a freeze is coming.

841
00:53:46.015 --> 00:53:48.601
All these years.
you show up out of nowhere.

842
00:53:48.601 --> 00:53:50.186
that's your opener?

843
00:53:50.186 --> 00:53:54.273
What about.
"Tonight. hell freezes over?"

844
00:53:54.273 --> 00:53:56.692
Nope. Still lame.

845
00:53:56.692 --> 00:53:58.945
Dang it. It sounded better
in my head.

846
00:53:58.945 --> 00:54:00.488
Never mind that. Freeze.

847
00:54:00.488 --> 00:54:02.114
Why was I lured out
to the middle--

848
00:54:02.114 --> 00:54:03.699
Oh. wait. I got one.

849
00:54:03.699 --> 00:54:06.869
Time for you
to get ice-creamed.

850
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:31.018
Answer me! Freeze!
Why did you bring me here?

851
00:54:31.769 --> 00:54:32.687
Whoa.

852
00:54:37.316 --> 00:54:38.776
Haven't you figured it out?

853
00:54:38.776 --> 00:54:42.279
We needed to get the Bat
out of Gotham.

854
00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:47.868
However. it appears
a much smaller Bat
has taken its place.

855
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:50.579
Damian!

856
00:55:06.137 --> 00:55:08.305
We've looked everywhere.

857
00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:11.225
There's no sign of that van
or my belt.

858
00:55:12.018 --> 00:55:13.644
Earlier.
you remarked on the need

859
00:55:13.644 --> 00:55:15.855
to prove your readiness
to become a superhero.

860
00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.481
Prove to whom?

861
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:19.734
To you.

862
00:55:19.734 --> 00:55:22.653
Uh. not you. my dad.

863
00:55:22.653 --> 00:55:24.363
So I am not dead.

864
00:55:24.363 --> 00:55:26.657
That is certainly welcome news.

865
00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:28.451
Sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

866
00:55:28.451 --> 00:55:29.618
It is not your fault.

867
00:55:29.618 --> 00:55:32.496
My central processing
made an erroneous assumption.

868
00:55:34.457 --> 00:55:36.250
- Observation.
- What?

869
00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:38.711
I may only be
a simulation of your father.

870
00:55:38.711 --> 00:55:41.255
but after an analysis
of his cognitive patterns

871
00:55:41.255 --> 00:55:43.758
in relation to your
current goal orientation.

872
00:55:43.758 --> 00:55:46.385
I have determined
that the two do not align.

873
00:55:46.385 --> 00:55:48.179
Wanna break that down. Bat-Dad?

874
00:55:48.179 --> 00:55:51.432
Getting your belt back
won't prove anything
to your dad.

875
00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:55.978
Maybe you think it won't.
but I know it will.

876
00:55:55.978 --> 00:55:57.313
It has to.

877
00:55:57.313 --> 00:56:00.775
Being Batman alongside my dad
is all I've ever wanted.

878
00:56:00.775 --> 00:56:03.569
I have to show Dad
I can handle myself.

879
00:56:03.569 --> 00:56:05.821
He worries way too much.

880
00:56:05.821 --> 00:56:09.325
He still makes me wear floaties
in the bathtub.

881
00:56:09.325 --> 00:56:12.161
I mean. come on.
I'm not a baby.

882
00:56:12.161 --> 00:56:14.455
Indeed. You are not a baby.

883
00:56:14.455 --> 00:56:17.041
You have been alive
for eight years.

884
00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:18.751
And four days.

885
00:56:18.751 --> 00:56:21.420
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

886
00:56:23.047 --> 00:56:24.215
I like this place.

887
00:56:25.091 --> 00:56:28.886
My memory matrix recalls
visiting many times
with my parents.

888
00:56:30.471 --> 00:56:31.889
I miss doing that with them.

889
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:34.433
Why did they stop taking--

890
00:56:35.476 --> 00:56:37.686
Oh. right.

891
00:56:37.686 --> 00:56:39.605
Yes. right.

892
00:56:50.074 --> 00:56:54.036
It must have been really hard
to lose your mom and dad
when you were just a kid.

893
00:56:55.913 --> 00:56:58.874
Although the memories
are technically not mine.

894
00:56:58.874 --> 00:57:00.751
it was very hard to be alone.

895
00:57:01.627 --> 00:57:03.629
In fact. your father created me

896
00:57:03.629 --> 00:57:08.342
in part to ensure
you would never know
a loneliness like that.

897
00:57:08.342 --> 00:57:09.885
Wow. he did?

898
00:57:13.097 --> 00:57:15.558
Hey. Bat-Dad. observation.

899
00:57:15.558 --> 00:57:17.143
Yes. Damian?

900
00:57:18.227 --> 00:57:19.395
I'm glad he did.

901
00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:21.647
I wouldn't want to be alone
right now.

902
00:57:22.231 --> 00:57:23.732
I'm glad I am here. too.

903
00:57:24.859 --> 00:57:26.443
You're a good friend. Bat-Dad.

904
00:57:27.027 --> 00:57:30.072
I'd give you a big hug
if I wasn't. you know.

905
00:57:30.072 --> 00:57:31.407
wearing you.

906
00:57:31.407 --> 00:57:32.491
It's okay.

907
00:57:32.491 --> 00:57:36.036
Just promise to give one
to your father
when you next see him.

908
00:57:36.954 --> 00:57:39.582
Yeah. I kind of owe him
one anyway.

909
00:57:41.876 --> 00:57:42.710
What the--

910
00:57:47.131 --> 00:57:48.299
Whoo-hoo!

911
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:53.971
Caution.
I'm detecting thin ice.

912
00:58:11.155 --> 00:58:15.034
My environmental
assessment system
indicates this may be a trap.

913
00:58:15.034 --> 00:58:17.578
I was thinking the same thing.
Bat-Dad.

914
00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:25.211
{\an8}-  Oswald Cobblepot.
- Oswald Cobblepot.

915
00:58:25.211 --> 00:58:28.005
I prefer The Penguin.

916
00:58:28.964 --> 00:58:31.300
You have my belt. Birdbrain.

917
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:36.138
My. my. He said
you were an obnoxious
little brat.

918
00:58:36.138 --> 00:58:37.139
Who said that?

919
00:58:40.559 --> 00:58:42.144
<i>Come now. Oswald.</i>

920
00:58:42.144 --> 00:58:45.022
<i>I never used
those words exactly.</i>

921
00:58:45.022 --> 00:58:46.357
Joker!

922
00:58:46.357 --> 00:58:49.109
<i>Oh. he may be obnoxious.
and he certainly acts
like a brat.</i>

923
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:51.487
<i>but I never called him--
What was the last one?</i>

924
00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:53.489
<i>Oh. it'll come to me.</i>

925
00:58:53.489 --> 00:58:55.324
What do you want. Joker?

926
00:58:55.324 --> 00:58:58.661
<i>Oh. you know your Uncle Joker.
Always stirring the pot.</i>

927
00:59:00.454 --> 00:59:01.622
<i>Now listen carefully.</i>

928
00:59:01.622 --> 00:59:05.042
<i>You will never
get your belt back.</i>

929
00:59:07.044 --> 00:59:10.297
Caution.
Joker is a master manipulator.

930
00:59:10.297 --> 00:59:14.134
<i>Never ever. ever. ever.
ever. ever. get it back.</i>

931
00:59:14.718 --> 00:59:16.220
Oh. yes. I will.

932
00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.888
{\an8}<i>-Will not.</i>
- Will too.

933
00:59:17.888 --> 00:59:19.473
<i>- Will not.</i>
- Will too.

934
00:59:19.473 --> 00:59:21.475
<i>Will not infinity.
And don't say
infinity plus one.</i>

935
00:59:21.475 --> 00:59:22.559
<i>because I can do this all day.</i>

936
00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:24.645
Six weeks is his record.

937
00:59:24.645 --> 00:59:28.816
<i>And do you know
how I can be so sure
you'll never get it back?</i>

938
00:59:28.816 --> 00:59:32.528
<i>Because it is so clear to me.
and to everyone.</i>

939
00:59:32.528 --> 00:59:36.865
<i>that you simply don't have
what it takes
to be a superhero.</i>

940
00:59:38.701 --> 00:59:39.952
<i>I mean. look at your belt.</i>

941
00:59:39.952 --> 00:59:41.829
<i>It's right there.</i>

942
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:44.832
<i>but I bet you couldn't
even snatch it
from old Penguin here.</i>

943
00:59:44.832 --> 00:59:48.210
<i>Weak. old. pathetic.
enfeebled. incontinent--</i>

944
00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:49.128
Hey!

945
00:59:49.128 --> 00:59:52.715
{\an8}Oh. yeah?
Give me back my belt.

946
00:59:52.715 --> 00:59:53.799
Whoa! Easy. kid.

947
00:59:53.799 --> 00:59:55.592
You heard the clown.
I'm enfeebled.

948
00:59:55.592 --> 00:59:58.095
<i>Now. that's proper motivation.</i>

949
00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.346
<i>My work here is done.</i>

950
00:59:59.346 --> 01:00:01.181
This plan better work.

951
01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:02.599
{\an8}All right. pipsqueak.

952
01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.101
Come and get it.

953
01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.653
Yeah!

954
01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:33.130
Warning.

955
01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:35.549
Core processing unit damaged.

956
01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:37.968
So long. Bat-Brat.

957
01:00:45.893 --> 01:00:48.395
Merry Christmas. Gotham.

958
01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.233
Now. look at that.

959
01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:54.735
My ride's here.

960
01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:56.987
Toodle-oo.

961
01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:59.239
{\an8}This ends now.

962
01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:01.825
Warning.
The damage I sustained

963
01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:03.911
has compromised
the suit's integrity.

964
01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:07.831
Adjusting to compression
at this altitude will bring
power below critical level.

965
01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:09.416
Hang on.
We're almost there.

966
01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:12.669
Got room for one more?

967
01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.880
Huh? For such a little kid.

968
01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.383
you sure are a pain
in the neck.

969
01:01:17.383 --> 01:01:19.593
-  Whoa.

970
01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:21.345
Whoa. whoa.

971
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.681
23 skidoo.

972
01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:27.184
I bid you adieu.

973
01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:38.237
What? He's a freak
of nature.

974
01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:55.629
Whoa!

975
01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:58.632
Warning.
Power levels
below critical.

976
01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:09.226
Let go. kid.
You'll kill us both.

977
01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:10.727
Give it to me! Give it to me!

978
01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:11.728
Give it to me!

979
01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:14.857
{\an8}Fine. Take it.
I hope it was worth it.

980
01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.073
No!

981
01:02:23.991 --> 01:02:25.909
What do I do? What do I do?

982
01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:28.370
Solution.
Diverting remaining power

983
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:30.497
to my inflation systems
will break your fall.

984
01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:32.082
{\an8}But what will happen to you?

985
01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.042
I am sorry. Damian.

986
01:02:34.835 --> 01:02:36.253
I will not survive.

987
01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:37.754
No. you can't.

988
01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.423
I'm sorry.
I should have listened.

989
01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:40.841
You were right
about The Penguin.

990
01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:42.050
About everything.

991
01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:43.844
Please. no!

992
01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:45.429
It's okay. Damian.

993
01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:50.267
Remember. an important quality
every good hero must possess

994
01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.352
is the willingness
to make sacrifice.

995
01:02:52.352 --> 01:02:54.605
Bat-Dad. no!

996
01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:55.856
Bye. Damian.

997
01:02:55.856 --> 01:02:59.193
Initiating emergency
inflation protocol

998
01:02:59.193 --> 01:03:00.944
in three. two...

999
01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:10.537
Bat-Dad!

1000
01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:14.041
Damian. you will make
a great hero one day.

1001
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.544
Don't leave me.

1002
01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:20.881
Before shut down.
I just want to thank you.

1003
01:03:21.924 --> 01:03:23.133
{\an8}For what?

1004
01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:25.928
Giving me warm memories
of my own.

1005
01:03:31.892 --> 01:03:33.393
Bat-Dad.

1006
01:03:35.062 --> 01:03:36.855

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:40.067
there's reports of mass
destruction downtown

1009
01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:42.152
and a crime wave
all across the city.

1010
01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.570
Calm down.

1011
01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:46.323
I've faced situations
more dire than this before.

1012
01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.040

They haven't turned
that on in years.

1017
01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.770
Crime is back in Gotham.

1018
01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.230
Run for your lives. everyone.

1019
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:19.606

{\an8}Oh. biscuits.

1024
01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.705
Kid. you gotta get out of here.

1025
01:04:34.705 --> 01:04:36.123
Nothing is safe anymore.

1026
01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:38.292
-  Hey!

1027
01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:39.543

Oh. am I glad to see you.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:55.642
Hey. that's the kid
who wrecked the parade.

1031
01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:57.269
Way to go. jerk.

1032
01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:59.187
You ruined Christmas.

1033
01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:00.689
Wait. I can explain.

1034
01:05:00.689 --> 01:05:03.525
I just wanted
to be a superhero.

1035

-  Get back here.
-  He's gonna pay.

-  Did you see him?

Alfred. what are you
doing here?

1041
01:06:49.548 --> 01:06:50.465
Did you forget?

1042
01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:55.470
Your steaming mug
of my world-famous hot cocoa
with extra marshmallows.

1043
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:59.933
Of course. that is.
unless you think cocoa
is kid stuff.

I'm in deep trouble. aren't I?

1046
01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:22.456
Oh. yes. most definitely.
Master Wayne.

1047
01:07:22.456 --> 01:07:24.291
Yeah. I figured.

1048
01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.173
{\an8}I just wanted
to be Batman so bad.

1049
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.760
{\an8}Maybe if Dad didn't treat me
like such baby...

1050
01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.970
Don't be so hard
on your father.

1051
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.680
He can overdo it sometimes.

1052
01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.391
but that's because he's trying
to protect the one thing

1053
01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.268
you have that he never did.

1054
01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:45.395
A childhood.

1055
01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:49.941
I'm no superhero.

1056
01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:53.779
I lost my belt.
I destroyed my Batsuit.

1057
01:07:53.779 --> 01:07:55.739
I have no idea
where I parked the bike.

1058
01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:58.784
I can't blame anyone but me.

1059
01:07:58.784 --> 01:08:02.037
Son. costumes and belts
aren't what make a superhero--

1060
01:08:02.037 --> 01:08:04.581
I'm sorry. Did you say
you misplaced the Batpod?

1061
01:08:05.874 --> 01:08:08.084
Um. never mind.

1062
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.796
Damian. becoming Batman

1063
01:08:10.796 --> 01:08:14.257
takes precisely what
your father has been
attempting to teach you.

1064
01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:18.094
Focus. responsibility. sacrifice.

1065
01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:20.639
Don't forget
high pain threshold.

1066
01:08:20.639 --> 01:08:22.808
Indeed.

1067
01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:26.520
And while you may not be
a superhero yet. little one.

1068
01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.981
in my heart.
I know one day you will be.

1069
01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:31.733
Thanks. Alfred.

1070
01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:33.568
But of course. my boy.

1071
01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:35.695
Now. come along.

1072
01:08:35.695 --> 01:08:38.907
I'd say we had
enough excitement
for one Christmas Eve.

1073
01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:08.270
"Dear Little Batman.

1074
01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:11.690
{\an8}you gave me the best
Christmas gift ever.

1075
01:09:11.690 --> 01:09:14.192
Let me return the favor"?

1076
01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.208
Alfred? Alfred!

1077
01:09:31.793 --> 01:09:33.211
Where am I?

1078
01:09:41.553 --> 01:09:42.721
Joker.

1079
01:09:44.097 --> 01:09:46.141

01:09:46.141 --> 01:09:48.101

- Whoa. whoa!

1085
01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:17.339

Oh. he's here.
Don't just stand there.

1092
01:11:05.095 --> 01:11:06.763
It's nearly Christmas morning.

1093
01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:08.640
Come in. come in.

1094
01:11:12.644 --> 01:11:13.645
- You made it.

1095
01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:18.566
I am so sorry
the invite was so last minute.

1096
01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:20.735
What is this?

1097
01:11:20.735 --> 01:11:22.862
Uh. hello? Look around.

1098
01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:25.073
It's a Christmas party.

1099
01:11:25.699 --> 01:11:28.576
I don't know what you're up to.
but I'm taking you all in.

1100
01:11:28.576 --> 01:11:31.663
Oh. please. Still trying
the hero thing. are we?

1101
01:11:31.663 --> 01:11:34.457
Did we learn nothing
from tonight. young man?

1102
01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:35.458
Some people...

1103
01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.376
...you.

1104
01:11:36.376 --> 01:11:39.129
just aren't cut out
to be heroes.

1105
01:11:39.129 --> 01:11:40.880
Now. come enjoy the party.

1106
01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.093
Tonight. my boy.
we're celebrating
something very special.

1107
01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:48.805
Crime's triumphant return
to Gotham.

1108
01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.265
And what better way to do it

1109
01:11:50.265 --> 01:11:53.685
than by stealing
its Christmas.

1110
01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:58.314
This is where you say.
"Joker. you're mad.

1111
01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.150
Steal Christmas? But why?"

1112
01:12:01.609 --> 01:12:02.736
Joker. you're mad.

1113
01:12:02.736 --> 01:12:04.070
Steal Christmas? But why?

1114
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:06.197
It all goes back
to those glory days.

1115
01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:09.075
when my friends
and I would terrorize Gotham.

1116
01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:13.747
Hey. get back here!
After them!

1117
01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:18.043
You'll get yours
in the end. Joker.

1118
01:12:18.043 --> 01:12:20.628
-  <i>Oh. how we'd laugh.</i>

1119
01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:22.380
and laugh and laugh.

1120
01:12:25.467 --> 01:12:26.926
But then crime went away.

1121
01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:30.555
We were forced to... retire.

1122
01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:32.766
And as a result...

1123
01:12:32.766 --> 01:12:34.809
We drifted apart.

1124
01:12:35.769 --> 01:12:37.353
<i>Gotham City just voted</i>

1125
01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.773
<i>the safest place
on planet Earth.</i>

1126
01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:45.195
<i>Now. I always
thought the joy came
from committing crime.</i>

1127
01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:50.867
Looking back. it was about
committing crime together.

1128
01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.870
Aw. you big softie.

1129
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:54.996
I don't understand.

1130
01:12:54.996 --> 01:12:57.248
What does any of this
have to do with me?

1131
01:12:57.248 --> 01:13:00.293
The moment I saw
the sheer mayhem

1132
01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:02.879
you were capable of.
I realized that with your help.

1133
01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.631
we could kick
this whole groovy caper

1134
01:13:04.631 --> 01:13:06.341
up a notch and a half.

1135
01:13:06.341 --> 01:13:09.094
- High five!
- I'd never help you.

1136
01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:10.345
But you already did.

1137
01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:13.848
Your chaotic bat-boobery
was a perfect distraction!

1138
01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:17.018
<i>While all eyes
were on you.</i>

1139
01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:18.394
<i>we nabbed Christmas</i>

1140
01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:21.106
<i>- from every home in Gotham.</i>

1141
01:13:23.358 --> 01:13:25.026
Oh!

1142
01:13:40.041 --> 01:13:42.085
<i>We set out
to only steal Christmas.</i>

1143
01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:43.628
<i>but you...</i>

1144
01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:45.547
<i>You destroyed it.</i>

1145
01:13:47.382 --> 01:13:49.425
<i>- And now. thanks to you.</i>

1146
01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:52.971
<i>everyone is waking up
to no Christmas.</i>

1147
01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:59.102
I was just trying
to get my belt back.

1148
01:13:59.811 --> 01:14:02.897
And in the process of this
frankly. selfish pursuit.

1149
01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:05.608
you destroyed half the city.

1150
01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:08.695
Now that doesn't sound
much like a superhero to me.

1151
01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:11.614
In fact. it sounds more
like a super...

1152
01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:14.367
villain.

1153
01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:16.369
What? No. No. I'm not a--

1154
01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:17.495
Sure. you are.

1155
01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:19.622
Why do you think
I brought you here?

1156
01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:22.041
You're one of us. kid.

1157
01:14:23.543 --> 01:14:25.712
We couldn't have
done it without you.

1158
01:14:25.712 --> 01:14:28.840
Yes. Thank you.
from the bottom
of our cold hearts.

1159
01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.467
Thank you. indeed.

1160
01:14:35.013 --> 01:14:36.139
I can't believe...

1161
01:14:37.265 --> 01:14:38.308
You're right.

1162
01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:42.145
Only a supervillain would
ruin Christmas.

1163
01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:44.981
That's right.

1164
01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:46.858
To thank you
for your contribution.

1165
01:14:46.858 --> 01:14:51.154
we thought it'd be real swell
if we all chipped in
and got you something.

1166
01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:58.328
{\an8}My utility belt.

1167
01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:00.914
Your upgraded utility belt.

1168
01:15:00.914 --> 01:15:03.291
We replaced
all the useless safety gear

1169
01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:05.543
with more practical devices.

1170
01:15:09.923 --> 01:15:11.299
Well said. Bane.

1171
01:15:11.883 --> 01:15:15.678
It's the perfect accessory
for supervillains.

1172
01:15:16.763 --> 01:15:19.182
Think of all you went through
to get that belt.

1173
01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:21.643
You earned it.

1174
01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:23.311
Take it.

1175
01:15:24.062 --> 01:15:26.981
Take the belt!

1176
01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:30.693
Take the belt! Take the belt!

1177
01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.195
Take the belt!

1178
01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:40.870
<i>You must take my place
and become... the Batman.</i>

1179
01:15:42.664 --> 01:15:45.250
<i>Becoming Batman takes
precisely what your father</i>

1180
01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.960
<i>has been attempting
to teach you.</i>

1181
01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.464
<i>Give me the belt.</i>

1182
01:15:51.464 --> 01:15:53.341
<i>You're clearly
not ready for it.</i>

1183
01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:01.557
There now.

1184
01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:05.144
{\an8}Doesn't it feel good
to get what you want?

1185
01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:09.524
{\an8}I guess you're right. Joker.

1186
01:16:09.524 --> 01:16:11.025
{\an8}I'm no superhero.

1187
01:16:12.527 --> 01:16:15.488
{\an8}But then again. I'm not
a supervillain. either.

1188
01:16:16.823 --> 01:16:20.159
See. Joker.
being a superhero takes focus.

1189
01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:22.495
responsibility...

1190
01:16:26.416 --> 01:16:27.875
{\an8}and sacrifice.

1191
01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:41.055
Holy crap!

1192
01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:44.517
All right. Which one of you
gave a little kid explosives?

1193
01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.521
It did seem like
a good idea at the time.

1194
01:16:55.903 --> 01:16:56.821
That's not good.

1195
01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:07.582
My snow globe! You broke it.

1196
01:17:07.582 --> 01:17:09.751
Now I'm gonna break you.

1197
01:17:09.751 --> 01:17:12.045
{\an8}You got it backwards.
clown face.

1198
01:17:12.045 --> 01:17:15.214
{\an8}I'm taking you down.
all of you.

1199
01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:18.718
{\an8}And I'm taking these presents
back to the kids of Gotham.

1200
01:17:18.718 --> 01:17:21.262
{\an8}I'm saving Christmas!

1201
01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:24.390
You ungrateful. little twerp.

1202
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:27.143
I'm gonna chop you up
like sardines.

1203
01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:38.946
- Hiyah!

1204
01:17:40.031 --> 01:17:41.657
- Play ball!

1205
01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:48.831
- Crush him. Bane.

1206
01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:10.353
All you had to do
was take the belt.

1207
01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:13.064
and now I'm gonna
take your head.

1208
01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:29.664
Looks like you're
in a little trouble.
Little Batman.

1209
01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:40.174
No one poops
on my party and lives.

1210
01:18:41.426 --> 01:18:42.760
Yes.

1211
01:18:44.137 --> 01:18:45.555
- What was that?

1212
01:19:04.407 --> 01:19:05.324
Dad!

1213
01:19:06.117 --> 01:19:07.994
Thank goodness.
I found you.

1214
01:19:07.994 --> 01:19:10.913
Are you okay?
You have any boo-boos?
Are you hurt?

1215
01:19:11.873 --> 01:19:13.458
Dad. I'm fine.

1216
01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:15.460
How very touching.

1217
01:19:16.461 --> 01:19:17.920
Stand back. son.

1218
01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.881
Why didn't you tell me
you were a father?

1219
01:19:19.881 --> 01:19:21.132
I thought we were friends.

1220
01:19:21.132 --> 01:19:23.050
I'm not your friend. Joker.

1221
01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:25.344
I gotta say. love the beard.

1222
01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:27.638
Really takes
the intimidation game
up a peg.

1223
01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:28.931
- Thanks.

1224
01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:35.938
Looks like it's time to kill
two bats with one stone.

1225
01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:39.567
Dad. I can do this.

1226
01:19:39.567 --> 01:19:42.111
Almost makes me miss my father.

1227
01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:45.406
But then I remember
how he dumped my bassinet
in the sewer!

1228
01:19:49.494 --> 01:19:50.953
Just leave him alone.

1229
01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:56.250
{\an8}Come on. I've been fighting
these guys all day.

1230
01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:57.752
Damian. I told you
to stay back.

1231
01:20:00.046 --> 01:20:01.172
Dad. listen to me. I can help.

1232
01:20:01.172 --> 01:20:03.674
I said no. Damian.
You're just a kid.

1233
01:20:03.674 --> 01:20:06.344
No. I'm not. I'm your kid. Dad.

1234
01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:17.855
Dad!

1235
01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:32.787
{\an8} Don't worry. Dad.
I'll protect you.

1236
01:20:32.787 --> 01:20:34.664
- Nobody hurts my dad.

1237
01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:36.707
- What?

1238
01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:37.792
Hiyah!

1239
01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:43.714
-  Not so tough
without these. are you?

1240
01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:51.389
You okay. Dad?

1241
01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:54.725
He... he is my kid.

1242
01:20:55.393 --> 01:20:56.519
Batman is waking up.

1243
01:20:57.478 --> 01:20:59.480
Leave my dad alone!

1244
01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:05.236
Dude! Damian. rad ninja skills.

1245
01:21:05.236 --> 01:21:06.320
Thanks. Dad.

1246
01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:08.823
Where's the belt?

1247
01:21:09.824 --> 01:21:11.284
Long story.

1248
01:21:11.284 --> 01:21:12.285
Tell me later.

1249
01:21:12.285 --> 01:21:13.536
In the meantime...

1250
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:15.705
Whoa!

1251
01:21:15.705 --> 01:21:17.456
Your utility belt?

1252
01:21:17.456 --> 01:21:18.541
Awesome!

1253
01:21:20.293 --> 01:21:22.128
Wait. What about you?

1254
01:21:22.128 --> 01:21:23.838
Always carry a spare.

1255
01:21:23.838 --> 01:21:25.339
Told you.
you had a lot to learn.

1256
01:21:26.132 --> 01:21:27.049
Now. what do you say?

1257
01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:28.926
You need a wingman?

1258
01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:32.888
{\an8}- More like a sidekick.

1259
01:21:34.432 --> 01:21:37.810
Allow me to break the ice.
Little Batman.

1260
01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:39.937
Come on. kiddo.
Let's finish this.

1261
01:21:51.824 --> 01:21:54.744
This is the best
Christmas present ever.

1262
01:21:56.787 --> 01:21:58.247
Oh. no.

1263
01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:06.172
My back!

1264
01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:09.133
Hot enough for you?

1265
01:22:09.967 --> 01:22:11.302
Not even close.

1266
01:22:12.345 --> 01:22:13.721
Where's the little one?

1267
01:22:18.351 --> 01:22:20.561
No!

1268
01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.442
You two
look so cute together.

1269
01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:28.861
I almost hate
having to blow you apart.

1270
01:22:29.779 --> 01:22:33.324
Yeah. crush their stupid faces.

1271
01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:47.421
Uh-oh. Hit me. Damian!

1272
01:22:48.506 --> 01:22:50.549
Careful. Don't poke
your eye out.

1273
01:22:51.759 --> 01:22:54.595
A Merry Christmas
to me and to you.

1274
01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:56.347
a dark night.

1275
01:22:58.557 --> 01:22:59.892
You missed!

1276
01:23:00.768 --> 01:23:02.687
That's kind of the point.

1277
01:23:02.687 --> 01:23:04.772
Oh. Oh. right.
they're Batarangs.

1278
01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:43.561
Merry Christmas.

1279
01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:51.152
-  Ooh.

1280
01:23:51.152 --> 01:23:52.445
Oh.

1281
01:23:53.988 --> 01:23:55.239
<i>♪ Da-na-na-na-na-na ♪</i>

1282
01:23:58.534 --> 01:24:00.703
How many times
is he gonna fall in that junk?

1283
01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:03.706
Seriously. he should keep
a snorkel in his suit pocket.

1284
01:24:04.749 --> 01:24:07.126
Ready to go home
for Christmas?

1285
01:24:07.126 --> 01:24:10.212
Actually. Dad.
we have one last mission.

1286
01:24:29.732 --> 01:24:31.525
Merry Christmas!

1287
01:24:31.525 --> 01:24:33.110
-  Look. it's Batman!
-  Batman!

1288
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:35.696
- All right.
- Hey. it's our stuff.

1289
01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:37.615
My drum set!

1290
01:24:37.615 --> 01:24:39.992
A one. and a two.
and a joy to you.

1291
01:24:39.992 --> 01:24:43.537
All right. everyone.
Christmas is back on.

1292
01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:55.674
Look. it's our presents.

1293
01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:57.384
- Christmas is saved.
-  Oh. wonderful.

1294
01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:02.973
Go long.

1295
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:12.733
Merry Christmas. Gotham City.

1296
01:25:21.909 --> 01:25:23.994
That would seem to be
all the presents. young sir.

1297
01:25:23.994 --> 01:25:26.205
Nope. Still one left.

1298
01:25:26.205 --> 01:25:27.331
What's that?

1299
01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:29.792
{\an8}- Merry Christmas. Dad.

1300
01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:31.085
I owed you a hug.

1301
01:25:31.085 --> 01:25:33.379
Best Christmas gift ever.

1302
01:25:33.379 --> 01:25:34.964
Hm. the price was right.

1303
01:25:34.964 --> 01:25:36.799
- I beg your pardon. sirs.

1304
01:25:36.799 --> 01:25:38.175
but by any chance.

1305
01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:42.304
is there room for
an old Englishman and a tabby
in that embrace?

1306
01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:44.056
There always is.

1307
01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:45.724
Merry Christmas. guys.

1308
01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:48.686
Damian. what's wrong?

1309
01:25:49.186 --> 01:25:53.274
{\an8}I know it sounds silly.
but I kind of
feel bad for Joker.

1310
01:25:53.274 --> 01:25:55.693
Feel bad for Joker?

1311
01:25:55.693 --> 01:25:57.278
That sounds insane.

1312
01:25:57.278 --> 01:25:59.154
I mean. he just
hit me in the head
with a mallet.

1313
01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:00.614
like an hour ago.

1314
01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:01.657
{\an8}I know.

1315
01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:05.452
{\an8}But all he wanted
for Christmas
was to not be alone.

1316
01:26:07.746 --> 01:26:09.456
My head still hurts. Damian.

1317
01:26:09.456 --> 01:26:11.709
- I mean. that mallet
was like this big.

1318
01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:14.461
{\an8}You know. Dad.
you both say
that you're sworn enemies.

1319
01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:15.462
{\an8}- But deep down.

1320
01:26:15.462 --> 01:26:17.715
{\an8}I think you and Joker
really like each other.

1321
01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:19.633
Damian. he's a supervillain.

1322
01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:21.051
Mom's a supervillain.

1323
01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:24.138
Mom's... complicated.

1324
01:26:24.138 --> 01:26:26.015
A complicated supervillain.

1325
01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:28.809
Hey. don't you start.

1326
01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:31.645
Also. I hate the Joker.

1327
01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:39.612

1328

I know the words to.

1329
01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:45.492
Well. "smells" does
rhyme with "bells."

1330
01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:47.328
