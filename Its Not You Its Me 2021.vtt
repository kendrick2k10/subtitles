4
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.083
- It's better.

5
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.375
- It lacks excitement.

6
00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:25.625
- You still don't like it?

7
00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.458
- This is a big presentation.

8
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.250
- Maybe I've heard it too many times.

9
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.709
I need the board to be 100% in.

10
00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:34.625
If they don't approve
the next round of funding

11
00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:37.542
in next month's meeting.
there won't be an A7.

12
00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:40.500
- We can't keep flying the A6.

13
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.333
- You don't have to convince me

14
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.083
but if you don't convince them.

15
00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:47.291
two of us won't be here
at the end of the year.

16
00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:50.959
We'll still be here.

17
00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:52.667
- Oh.

18
00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:55.500
- Punch it up.

19
00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:05.500
- Punch it up?

20
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.500
- So?

21
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.125
- What?

22
00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:14.500
- Tonight.

23
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.792
- Oh. dinner at seven.
then I'm gonna do it.

24
00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:23.709
- Have you thought about
maybe. I don't know.

25
00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:28.000
just waiting until we
wrap up on this A7 deal?

26
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
What happens if you get
fired before the wedding?

27
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.458
- You think we won't get the deal?

28
00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:37.500
- No. we will. we will.

29
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.959
Yeah. we'll get it.

30
00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.291
I just. I worry too much.

31
00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:43.959
Go have a fantastic night

32
00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.458
and text me. if you get the chance.

33
00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.166
- You're such a great friend.

34
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:54.291
- We make a great team.

35
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:57.542
- [Jason] I'll text you.

36
00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:04.291
- Yeah. he'll text you.

37
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:09.125
(lighthearted music)

38
00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:12.250
- Melissa.

39
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.125
Over the last two years.
you've changed my life.

40
00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:18.083
You've made me a better man

41
00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:20.083
and showed me what real love is.

42
00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:25.709
We've created so many lasting memories.

43
00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:30.291
from Cancun to Canada.

44
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:33.792
I can't imagine having
done it with anyone else.

45
00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:36.000
I know. we're still young.

46
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.917
But if there's one thing
I'm sure of. I love you.

47
00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:50.208
(soft rock music in background)

48
00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.542
Will you make me the happiest man

49
00:02:53.542 --> 00:02:55.500
in the world and marry me?

50
00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:09.709
(both moaning)

51
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.333
- Don't stop.

52
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:18.542
Jason.

53
00:03:18.542 --> 00:03:19.375
- Kyle?

54
00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:21.709
Why?

55
00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:22.709
I'm gonna throw up.

56
00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.250
- Stop.

57
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.041
It's not about Kyle.

58
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:27.166
- If you're having sex with him.

59
00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:28.834
it's like I'm having sex with him.

60
00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:31.458
- Not exactly.

61
00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:33.208
- What if you got pregnant?

62
00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:34.458
We'd be on Maury.

63
00:03:34.458 --> 00:03:37.500
"Jason. you are not the father."

64
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.959
- Kyle and I only have anal sex.

65
00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.583
- What?

66
00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:43.709
You told me you didn't.

67
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.709
- Just not with you.

68
00:03:48.834 --> 00:03:50.417
The first time you went there.

69
00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:52.458
you were touching it with your thumbs

70
00:03:52.458 --> 00:03:55.166
like it was a PlayStation button.

71
00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:59.458
Either go in or get out.

72
00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:02.959
- A little navigation
would have been nice.

73
00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:14.917
- Oh.

74
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.083
I'm sorry. bro.

75
00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:21.709
I didn't know you and Mel were serious.

76
00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:26.625
- Maybe it's best you go
and let Jason and I talk.

77
00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:28.375
- Oh yeah. no problem.

78
00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:31.250
No hard feelings. bro?

79
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.834
- Yes hard feelings. bro.

80
00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:37.000
- Ah. that's too bad. man.

81
00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:49.542
- What was that. Mel?

82
00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.125
- Jason.

83
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.750
We need to talk.

84
00:04:59.458 --> 00:05:01.834
It's not you. it's me.

85
00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:04.917
- So do you just have anal with him

86
00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:06.542
or was that just today?

87
00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:09.500
- If we can't just talk.
then you need to leave.

88
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.333
- Fine.

89
00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:11.166
- Fine.

90
00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:14.959
- Okay. wait.

91
00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:16.750
Let's talk.

92
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.250
- You should have called
before you came over.

93
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.083
- We had dinner plans at now.

94
00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:28.709
- You're right.

95
00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:31.333
I should have told you months ago.

96
00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:34.583
- You've been sleeping
with him for months?

97
00:05:34.583 --> 00:05:35.709
- No.

98
00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:37.792
Kyle has just been a few times.

99
00:05:39.458 --> 00:05:40.291
- Oh.

100
00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:43.417
Okay. I can get past that.

101
00:05:46.792 --> 00:05:49.667
- But there's been a few others.

102
00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:51.750
- A few?

103
00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:53.542
Two?

104
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.750
- No. two is two.

105
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.333
A few is two or more.

106
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.709
Look. it's not about how many.

107
00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:08.667
It's about you and me.

108
00:06:11.208 --> 00:06:13.417
The last two years have been...

109
00:06:16.291 --> 00:06:17.834
What I'm trying to say is-

110
00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:18.667
- Wait.

111
00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:21.000
I have something to say.

112
00:06:26.417 --> 00:06:30.834
Melissa. over the last two years

113
00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:32.500
you have changed my life.

114
00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:35.917
You've made me a better man

115
00:06:35.917 --> 00:06:37.625
and helped focus the direction of my life.

116
00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:38.458
- Jason!

117
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.000
It's over.

- You're just saying that
because she doesn't like you.

131

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:14.625
You're up early.

- You're free to buy
whatever cereal you want.

156
00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:29.458
- Last night. I met these two girls

157
00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:31.000
on my last delivery.

158
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.750
They invited me in and
we totally got stoned.

159
00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:36.959
I'm going back tonight.

160
00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:37.792
Come with me.

161
00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:40.875
- I'm good.

162
00:09:40.875 --> 00:09:42.542
- But you gotta get out there.

163
00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:47.917
Okay.

164
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.417
(knocking at door)

165
00:10:08.458 --> 00:10:10.166
- Hi. Vee.

166
00:10:10.166 --> 00:10:12.542
- Hey. are you avoiding me?

167
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.583
- No.

168
00:10:15.917 --> 00:10:18.125
I just. I didn't get much sleep.

169
00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:24.291
- Yeah. well. you look like shit.

170
00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:27.000
- Thank you.

171
00:10:29.917 --> 00:10:30.750
- Are you sick?

172
00:10:33.834 --> 00:10:35.291
- It's a long story.

173
00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:41.458
- When you want something.
you really commit.

174
00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:44.375
What are you gonna do now?

175
00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:48.917
- I don't know.

176
00:10:51.166 --> 00:10:52.041
You're a girl.

177
00:10:52.041 --> 00:10:53.291
How do I get her back?

178
00:10:54.458 --> 00:10:55.625
- You want her back?

179
00:10:57.458 --> 00:10:58.709
- Weren't you listening?

180
00:11:02.291 --> 00:11:04.000
- So you go to propose.

181
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.041
and you catch her having
sex with another guy.

182
00:11:09.542 --> 00:11:10.375
- Anal.

183
00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:14.166
In some countries. that's
not considered sex.

184
00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:17.959
- Then you find out that
she's been cheating on you

185
00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:19.750
with a whole bunch of other guys.

186
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.417
- But not a bunch.

187
00:11:21.417 --> 00:11:22.250
A few.

188
00:11:23.792 --> 00:11:25.333
Possibly more than two.

189
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.959
- But she said that it was over.

190
00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:35.083
- Why are you focusing
on all the negatives?

191
00:11:38.291 --> 00:11:39.959
- How did you get this fucked up?

192
00:11:43.709 --> 00:11:45.417
- I thought you were here to help?

193
00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:47.709
- I am.

194
00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:49.667
I am.

195
00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:57.500
You know what. I think you
should go take a shower.

196
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.875
'Cause the look and the
smell is a bit much.

197
00:12:03.208 --> 00:12:04.125
That's a start.

198
00:12:07.542 --> 00:12:10.792
So you're telling me in two years.

199
00:12:10.792 --> 00:12:14.959
she never once said "Don't do this."

200
00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:16.125
or "I don't like that?"

201
00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:20.834
- She did say that I treat her butt hole

202
00:12:20.834 --> 00:12:23.291
like a PlayStation button.

203
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:24.125
- What?

204
00:12:25.667 --> 00:12:27.417
Yeah. it doesn't matter.

205
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.333
You know. in most relationships.

206
00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:37.750
a couple of months go by. problems arise.

207
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.125
and you just deal with them.

208
00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:42.291
- Never happened.

209
00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:53.959
- How many girlfriends have you had?

210
00:12:53.959 --> 00:12:56.208
Like real relationships.
ones that have lasted longer

211
00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:57.083
than three months.

212
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.625
- Four. or five.

213
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.375
And Melissa. she's the longest.

214
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.333
- Four or five?

215
00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:13.250
That's a doable number.

216
00:13:16.208 --> 00:13:18.709
You know what I think you should do?

217
00:13:18.709 --> 00:13:20.583
I think you should go to them

218
00:13:20.583 --> 00:13:22.333
and asked them how you messed up.

219
00:13:24.208 --> 00:13:25.542
- How I messed it up?

220
00:13:25.542 --> 00:13:29.083
- Yeah. like. get their opinion

221
00:13:29.083 --> 00:13:31.875
on you and the relationship.

222
00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:33.875
Find out what happened.

223
00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:37.917
You know like. were you bad in bed.

224
00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:42.166
or did you have bad breath

225
00:13:42.166 --> 00:13:43.208
or did you snore in your sleep

226
00:13:43.208 --> 00:13:45.417
or dress funny or.

227
00:13:45.417 --> 00:13:46.709
did the parents hate you.

228
00:13:47.792 --> 00:13:50.208
Just ask them questions.

229
00:13:50.208 --> 00:13:54.917
It might give you an answer
as to why Melissa dumped you.

230
00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:58.959
- You want me to ask all my exes

231
00:13:58.959 --> 00:14:00.125
why I'm a bad boyfriend?

232
00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:02.166
- Yes.

233
00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:06.166
- I don't see how this is helping.

234
00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:07.000
- It's helping.

235
00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:09.291
Drink up.

236
00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:12.500
We are on the verge of a breakthrough.

237
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.917
Oh God.

238
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.500
(dog barking)
(garbage truck whirring)

239
00:14:28.709 --> 00:14:31.667
(Jason groaning)

240
00:14:31.667 --> 00:14:34.166
(dog barking)

241
00:14:40.041 --> 00:14:43.834
- Dude. thank you for not coming with me.

242
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.583
What happened to you?

243
00:14:48.166 --> 00:14:49.542
- Major hangover.

244
00:14:50.792 --> 00:14:54.667
- Anyways. last night I went
back to those two girls' house.

245
00:14:54.667 --> 00:14:57.083
At first. we're just sitting and talking.

246
00:14:57.083 --> 00:14:58.458
I was bored as shit.

247
00:14:58.458 --> 00:15:00.125
I was about to leave.

248
00:15:00.125 --> 00:15:03.291
Then. they started kissing
right in front of me.

249
00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:04.500
- Right.

250
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.000
- No bullshit.

251
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.875
Then they look at me and
they go. do you wanna join?

252
00:15:10.166 --> 00:15:11.375
Like that's a question.

253
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.041
My first three way.

254
00:15:16.709 --> 00:15:18.083
- You're serious?

255
00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:21.709
- Four boobs and two vaginas
is a lot of responsibility.

256
00:15:21.709 --> 00:15:24.250
You gotta multitask.

257
00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:27.458
- I'm glad it went well.

258
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.208
I'm going back to sleep.

259
00:15:34.625 --> 00:15:38.333
- Hey. I'm sorry you
had to get drunk alone.

260
00:15:40.166 --> 00:15:42.333
- I didn't. Veronica came over.

261
00:15:42.333 --> 00:15:43.792
- Bang her?

262
00:15:43.792 --> 00:15:44.834
- We're just friends.

263
00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:48.041
- Should've.

264
00:15:52.208 --> 00:15:55.709
(reflective guitar music)

265
00:16:04.375 --> 00:16:07.291
(knocking at door)

266
00:16:11.709 --> 00:16:13.417
- I thought I might see you today.

267
00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:16.208
- What happened last night?

268
00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:19.083
- You don't remember?

269
00:16:22.709 --> 00:16:24.542
- And I thought this was a good idea?

270
00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:27.500
- Check your phone. it's in Notes.

271
00:16:30.208 --> 00:16:32.709
We managed to track down all of your exes.

272
00:16:32.709 --> 00:16:35.291
we found out where they
lived. where they work.

273
00:16:35.291 --> 00:16:37.792
you even went as far as
mapping out an order.

274
00:16:39.458 --> 00:16:41.041
Look. there should be
a link at the bottom.

275
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.709
- [Jason] I don't remember any of this.

276
00:16:47.792 --> 00:16:50.917
- So you don't remember
having sex with me?

277
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.834
- Did we?

278
00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:00.834
- No.

279
00:17:00.834 --> 00:17:01.667
No. we didn't.

280
00:17:03.792 --> 00:17:05.208
- This is gonna take a week.

281
00:17:05.208 --> 00:17:06.125
- Four days.

282
00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:08.208
You already texted Tom
and got the days off.

283
00:17:08.208 --> 00:17:09.041
- What?

284
00:17:12.625 --> 00:17:13.792
I'm going today?

285
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.792
- Why wait?

286
00:17:16.792 --> 00:17:18.208
Just go and talk to them

287
00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:20.583
and then give me a call
and tell me what they said.

288
00:17:20.583 --> 00:17:22.500
You're gonna need a female translator.

289
00:17:24.375 --> 00:17:25.875
- This is crazy.

290
00:17:25.875 --> 00:17:27.709
- No. this is necessary.

291
00:17:29.834 --> 00:17:32.000
Come on. just go home and pack.

292
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.500
This is gonna be good for you.

293
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.667
And no communication with Melissa.

294
00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:41.208
No texts. no calls.

295
00:17:41.208 --> 00:17:43.083
Not until you get back.

296
00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:44.834
Just give her a couple of days too.

297
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.000
- It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

298
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.959
Why put yourself through it?

299
00:17:52.959 --> 00:17:54.291
- Veronica's right.

300
00:17:54.291 --> 00:17:57.834
I have no idea why any of my
past relationships failed.

301
00:17:57.834 --> 00:18:00.917
Everything's good and
then overnight. done.

302
00:18:00.917 --> 00:18:03.458
- That's why it's dating.

303
00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:04.917
It's a test drive.

304
00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:08.667
Check under the hood.
take it out on a trip.

305
00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:09.875
- Well if you have all the answers.

306
00:18:09.875 --> 00:18:11.709
then what's my problem?

307
00:18:11.709 --> 00:18:12.750
- One thing.

308
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.959
You date out of your class.

309
00:18:14.959 --> 00:18:15.792
- What?

310
00:18:15.792 --> 00:18:18.000
- The girls you date are too hot for you.

311
00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:20.959
You're average.

312
00:18:20.959 --> 00:18:23.125
They're above average.

313
00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:25.750
- On what scale?

314
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.417
- On every scale.

315
00:18:27.417 --> 00:18:30.667
- You're a quantity dater.
I'm a quality dater.

316
00:18:33.583 --> 00:18:36.041
- My objections have been stated.

317
00:18:36.041 --> 00:18:37.250
- See you in a few days.

318
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.000
- Can I use your apartment
while you're gone?

319
00:18:47.458 --> 00:18:49.041
- What's the matter with yours?

320
00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:50.125
- I have roommates.

321
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.583
I can't get any privacy.

322
00:18:53.583 --> 00:18:55.333
- Oh. I know the feeling.

323
00:18:58.458 --> 00:19:01.041

So how'd you meet?

346
00:20:02.917 --> 00:20:06.166
- After ASU. I interned
in San Diego for a year.

347
00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:07.959
I was at the beach one day

348
00:20:07.959 --> 00:20:10.041
and I saw her walk by after surfing.

349
00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:13.542
That night. I saw her
again at this gaslight bar.

350
00:20:15.291 --> 00:20:16.750
- How long did you date?

351
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.834
- Maybe six months.

352
00:20:18.834 --> 00:20:19.917
- Then how did it end?

353
00:20:20.917 --> 00:20:23.417
- One day she said she
couldn't see me anymore.

354
00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:27.000
- Okay. well good luck

355
00:20:28.041 --> 00:20:29.583
and give me a call after. okay?

356
00:20:29.583 --> 00:20:31.000

357

- Nicole?

377
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.625
Wow. how are you?

378
00:21:23.625 --> 00:21:25.917
- I'm great. still surfing. you know.

379
00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:29.208
- This is so weird.

380
00:21:29.208 --> 00:21:31.542
- Kinda like how we first met.

381
00:21:31.542 --> 00:21:34.041
Well. where you saw me

382
00:21:34.041 --> 00:21:36.667
and then stalked me to that gas lamp bar.

383
00:21:36.667 --> 00:21:37.542
- The Tipsy Crow.

384
00:21:40.417 --> 00:21:42.291
- So are you still living here?

385
00:21:42.291 --> 00:21:44.208
- No. I'm in LA now.

386
00:21:44.208 --> 00:21:45.041
How 'bout you?

387
00:21:47.291 --> 00:21:49.458
- I'm still living here.

388
00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:50.291
- Duh.

389
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.625
You look fantastic.

390
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.333
- Thank you.

391
00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:56.166
Live is good.

392
00:21:57.208 --> 00:21:58.750
So. what brought you down here?

393
00:22:00.166 --> 00:22:01.875
- I just went through a breakup.

394
00:22:01.875 --> 00:22:04.709
I want to propose and she was
sleeping with my old roommate

395
00:22:04.709 --> 00:22:06.333
plus a few others.

396
00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:07.875
But not at the same time.

397
00:22:07.875 --> 00:22:10.583
So I got in the car and drove
out of town to get away.

398
00:22:12.792 --> 00:22:14.417
I'm sorry. probably way more info

399
00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:15.333
than you were looking for.

400
00:22:15.333 --> 00:22:16.250
- A little.

401
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.333
So. you have dinner plans tonight?

402
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.417
(soft music)

403
00:22:41.709 --> 00:22:45.625
If I'm being honest. this
is my only good meal.

404
00:22:50.917 --> 00:22:51.792
- If we're being honest.

405
00:22:51.792 --> 00:22:54.500
us seeing each other again
wasn't exactly an accident.

406
00:22:55.959 --> 00:22:56.792
- I know.

407
00:22:58.417 --> 00:22:59.250
- How?

408
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.333
- I have a video doorbell.

409
00:23:02.333 --> 00:23:03.750
Records anyone that walks up.

410
00:23:04.834 --> 00:23:08.000
- But when I left. I had
no idea I would see you.

411
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.166
That was complete luck.

412
00:23:10.125 --> 00:23:12.333
- Right. like when we first met.

413
00:23:13.667 --> 00:23:15.625
I'm sure you followed me to that bar.

414
00:23:17.625 --> 00:23:19.709
- 100% fluke.

415
00:23:19.709 --> 00:23:20.542
- A fluke.

416
00:23:23.375 --> 00:23:24.667
- A perfect coincidence.

417
00:23:37.208 --> 00:23:38.917
- So why did you really come down?

418
00:23:43.291 --> 00:23:44.125
- Do you mind?

419
00:23:56.041 --> 00:24:00.250
(speaking in foreign language)

420
00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.875
- So I don't know if you
remember. but I was married.

421
00:24:05.667 --> 00:24:07.834
I should have said no
but I got so caught up

422
00:24:07.834 --> 00:24:10.458
in the proposal and the family.

423
00:24:12.834 --> 00:24:13.959
She did you a favor.

424
00:24:19.959 --> 00:24:22.709
- When we were dating.
what was it about me

425
00:24:22.709 --> 00:24:23.834
that made you break up?

426
00:24:24.917 --> 00:24:27.375
Be brutal. I can handle it.

427
00:24:27.375 --> 00:24:30.000
- So that's why you showed up.

428
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.959
You're trying to figure
out why she said no.

429
00:24:31.959 --> 00:24:33.333
- What?

430
00:24:33.333 --> 00:24:36.333
- Come on. Jason. be honest.

431
00:24:39.417 --> 00:24:41.792
Our breakup had nothing to do with you.

432
00:24:43.792 --> 00:24:45.709
- It's not me. it's you.

433
00:24:45.709 --> 00:24:48.750
I mean it's not you. it's me.

434
00:24:50.625 --> 00:24:54.166
- Usually. that's an
excuse but it was true.

435
00:24:55.291 --> 00:24:58.333
I met you right when my marriage ended.

436
00:24:58.333 --> 00:25:03.333
You showed up all young and
cute and quirky and young.

437
00:25:05.333 --> 00:25:09.417
I was just flattered
that I was still noticed.

438
00:25:09.417 --> 00:25:11.000
- What?

439
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.917
You were like 27. surfer goddess.

440
00:25:14.917 --> 00:25:17.291
and cooler than Beyonce.

441
00:25:19.166 --> 00:25:20.000
- Thank you.

442
00:25:23.417 --> 00:25:26.083
- But seriously. what happened?

443
00:25:27.375 --> 00:25:29.291
We were doing everything
together for months

444
00:25:29.291 --> 00:25:30.917
and then you just broke it off.

445
00:25:34.375 --> 00:25:36.417
- You want me to be brutal?

446
00:25:36.417 --> 00:25:37.250
- Yes.

447
00:25:39.041 --> 00:25:42.834
- So we had just gotten back from X-Fest

448
00:25:42.834 --> 00:25:44.333
and we started fooling around.

449
00:25:45.333 --> 00:25:47.417
It was a really good night.

450
00:25:47.417 --> 00:25:48.667
We were on fire.

451
00:25:51.208 --> 00:25:53.000
Your mouth was right by my ear.

452
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.333
so I can hear you breathing

453
00:25:55.875 --> 00:25:57.250
and then you whispered-

454
00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.333
- I love you.

455
00:26:00.417 --> 00:26:01.417
I thought you didn't

456
00:26:02.333 --> 00:26:05.250
or like did and didn't want to. you know?

457
00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.000
- Jason. I'm sorry.

458
00:26:07.959 --> 00:26:10.166
I loved feeling loved by you.

459
00:26:11.542 --> 00:26:13.417
I just knew there wasn't a future.

460
00:26:14.583 --> 00:26:15.667
Just bad timing.

461
00:26:30.709 --> 00:26:32.083
- I should get going.

462
00:26:32.083 --> 00:26:32.917
- Wait.

463
00:26:35.125 --> 00:26:36.583
I have something to show you.

464
00:26:39.625 --> 00:26:43.041
(reflective piano music)

465
00:26:52.208 --> 00:26:53.041
Remember these?

466
00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:56.125
- Wow.

467
00:27:00.625 --> 00:27:02.583
- I didn't come over here to do this-

468
00:27:02.583 --> 00:27:03.792
(Nicole shushing)

469
00:27:03.792 --> 00:27:06.583
- Just tonight and then friends.

470
00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:08.083
Nod if you understand.

471
00:27:10.458 --> 00:27:11.667
Good.

472
00:27:11.667 --> 00:27:15.083
(reflective piano music)

473
00:27:28.542 --> 00:27:29.750
- I feel bad.

474
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.750
All we did was talk about me.

475
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:32.583
How's your life?

476
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:36.125
- It's how I like it.

477
00:27:37.041 --> 00:27:37.875
Simple.

478
00:27:39.125 --> 00:27:39.959
- Simple?

479
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.583
Are you dating anyone?

480
00:27:43.959 --> 00:27:45.041
- I like being single.

481
00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:47.625
There's a few guys that I see

482
00:27:47.625 --> 00:27:50.166
but they know it's only temporary.

483
00:27:53.125 --> 00:27:55.041
- Don't you think there's that one guy?

484
00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:58.542
- I married him.

485
00:27:58.542 --> 00:27:59.375
- Oh. right.

486
00:28:00.875 --> 00:28:03.375
- I like the freedom to do
what I want when I want.

487
00:28:03.375 --> 00:28:04.208
You know?

488
00:28:11.959 --> 00:28:14.792
- Was I okay last night?

489
00:28:14.792 --> 00:28:15.625
In bed.

490
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.000
- You were great.

491
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.583
Way better than I remembered.

492
00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:24.125
- You were like my sex Yoda.

493
00:28:26.083 --> 00:28:27.208
- How do you figure?

494
00:28:28.041 --> 00:28:33.041
- Well. before you. I would
just hop on and pound away.

495
00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:35.041
Sort of like a fish out of water

496
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.291
but you taught me to slow down.

497
00:28:38.291 --> 00:28:39.333
to be in the moment.

498
00:28:39.333 --> 00:28:41.750
and make it about you more than just me.

499
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.542
- Sounds like me.

500
00:28:43.542 --> 00:28:44.375
- Thank you.

501
00:28:45.291 --> 00:28:46.125
Really.

502
00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:52.000
I'm still a young Padawan.
but I think I'm adequate.

503
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.875
- More than adequate.

504
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.291
You're like a Jedi.

505
00:28:58.792 --> 00:28:59.792
- Jedi?

- You were meant to call last night.

513
00:29:26.834 --> 00:29:28.291
- [Jason] Sorry. it got late.

514
00:29:29.166 --> 00:29:31.417
- So what did you find out?

515
00:29:31.417 --> 00:29:33.083
- I said I love you too early.

516
00:29:33.083 --> 00:29:35.875
It freaked her out and
that's why we split up.

517
00:29:35.875 --> 00:29:37.458
- Yeah. makes sense.

518
00:29:37.458 --> 00:29:38.291
What else?

519
00:29:38.291 --> 00:29:41.000
- She said I'm more than adequate in bed

520
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
and even better now.

521
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.166
- You had sex with her?

522
00:29:45.333 --> 00:29:47.041
- It just happened.

523
00:29:47.041 --> 00:29:50.667
- Yeah right. what she just
tripped and fell on your dick?

524
00:29:50.667 --> 00:29:54.709
- No. she was showing me
this pink underwear I got her

525
00:29:54.709 --> 00:29:56.875
and she started draping open her robe.

526
00:29:56.875 --> 00:29:58.542
- I don't want to know.

527
00:29:58.542 --> 00:30:00.291
At least it wasn't Melissa.

528
00:30:01.709 --> 00:30:04.875
- I didn't even think
about her until just now.

529
00:30:04.875 --> 00:30:06.959
- That's a step in the right direction.

530
00:30:06.959 --> 00:30:08.333
- I'm not trying to forget about her.

531
00:30:08.333 --> 00:30:09.667
I'm trying to get her back.

532
00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:12.250
Hold on. Benji's calling me.

533
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.709
I'll call you later.

534
00:30:13.709 --> 00:30:14.542
- Okay. but-

535
00:30:15.959 --> 00:30:17.041
- What's up?

536
00:30:17.041 --> 00:30:19.542
- Dude. when are you coming home?

537
00:30:19.542 --> 00:30:20.917
- In a few days. why?

538
00:30:20.917 --> 00:30:22.709
- I invited the three way girls over

539
00:30:22.709 --> 00:30:24.875
and they're impossible to satisfy.

540
00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.333
They never get tired.

541
00:30:29.333 --> 00:30:31.125
- What do you want me to do about it?

542
00:30:31.125 --> 00:30:33.333
- I need you to take one
of them off my hands.

543
00:30:33.333 --> 00:30:35.458
One's doing a photo shoot.
one's in the bathroom.

544
00:30:35.458 --> 00:30:37.041
I'm fucking low.

545
00:30:37.041 --> 00:30:38.500
- No way.

546
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.000
- Please. I need to sleep.

547
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.208
Oh shit. she's coming.

548
00:30:42.208 --> 00:30:43.208
I'll call you later.

549
00:30:46.041 --> 00:30:47.208
- Come to bed.

550
00:30:48.125 --> 00:30:49.458
Now.

551
00:30:49.458 --> 00:30:50.959
- Okay.

00:31:45.375 --> 00:31:46.834
- Hello?

560
00:31:46.834 --> 00:31:48.750
- [Madison] We're closed till two P.M.

561
00:31:50.625 --> 00:31:51.750
- Okay. sorry.

562
00:31:54.875 --> 00:31:57.959
(glasses shattering)

563
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.542
- Hey. Jason.

564
00:32:09.542 --> 00:32:10.375
- Hi.

565
00:32:11.709 --> 00:32:13.291
I'm really sorry about this.

566
00:32:14.458 --> 00:32:15.542
I was just passing by

567
00:32:15.542 --> 00:32:17.792
and I wanted to see if
you still worked here.

568
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.208
- Why?

569
00:32:20.208 --> 00:32:21.834
- I was passing by and I thought.

570
00:32:21.834 --> 00:32:24.041
"I wonder if Madison still works there."

571
00:32:24.041 --> 00:32:26.291
So I put in a little
extra effort and parked.

572
00:32:29.041 --> 00:32:30.583
Now I know.

573
00:32:30.583 --> 00:32:31.417
- Now you know.

574
00:32:35.542 --> 00:32:38.166
- Do you have a few
minutes so we can catch up?

575
00:32:38.166 --> 00:32:40.333
- I have a lot of prep
work before we open.

576
00:32:42.667 --> 00:32:43.917
- Nice seeing you again.

577
00:32:49.125 --> 00:32:51.959
(glass crunching)

578
00:33:01.834 --> 00:33:02.667
- Hey.

579
00:33:04.166 --> 00:33:07.166
We close at 10 if you
wanna come back and talk.

580
00:33:07.166 --> 00:33:08.750
- Awesome.

581
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:09.583
- Yeah.

582
00:33:26.208 --> 00:33:27.291
- Hello?

583
00:33:27.291 --> 00:33:28.375
- [Jason] Hey!

584
00:33:28.375 --> 00:33:29.709
- Hey. who is this?

585
00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:31.834
- Jason.

586
00:33:33.083 --> 00:33:33.917
- Jason?

587
00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.375
College Jason?

588
00:33:37.208 --> 00:33:38.709
- [Jason] Yeah.

589
00:33:38.709 --> 00:33:39.959
- Why are you calling me?

590
00:33:42.458 --> 00:33:45.041
- I was in town and I wanted to say hi.

591
00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:47.875
- Jason. I gotta go.

592
00:33:47.875 --> 00:33:49.375
I'm gonna be late for work.

593
00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:50.375
- Okay. maybe later.

594
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:56.083
Or not.

595
00:34:09.166 --> 00:34:11.834
(phone chiming)

596
00:34:23.834 --> 00:34:26.083
- Okay. so what's the
deal. do you need money?

597
00:34:26.083 --> 00:34:27.500
- What. no.

598
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.625
- You're not dying. are you?

599
00:34:30.625 --> 00:34:31.458
- I'm fine.

600
00:34:32.542 --> 00:34:33.375
- Then what?

601
00:34:44.208 --> 00:34:47.750
- I wanna know what happened
with our relationship.

602
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:48.750
Why did we break up?

603
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.458
- You're looking for
closure after four years?

604
00:34:51.458 --> 00:34:52.291
- No.

605
00:34:54.583 --> 00:34:55.834
I just don't understand why any

606
00:34:55.834 --> 00:34:57.458
of my past relationships failed.

607
00:34:58.959 --> 00:35:01.375
- You came all the way
here just to ask me that?

608
00:35:02.208 --> 00:35:03.667
- You won't hurt my feelings.

609
00:35:11.875 --> 00:35:13.041
- My parents hated you.

610
00:35:24.709 --> 00:35:26.166
- Really?

611
00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:27.709
Parents love me.

612
00:35:27.709 --> 00:35:29.875
Usually more than the girl I'm dating.

613
00:35:29.875 --> 00:35:30.792
- I thought they'd like you too

614
00:35:30.792 --> 00:35:31.875
but you fucked it up.

615
00:35:35.625 --> 00:35:36.458
- [Jason] How?

616
00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:38.750
- You really don't remember?

617
00:35:44.458 --> 00:35:45.291
Mini golf.

618
00:35:46.875 --> 00:35:48.291
- You mean when you cheated?

619
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.834
- I didn't cheat. you toad.

620
00:35:50.834 --> 00:35:53.583
You couldn't stand the
fact that I beat you.

621
00:35:53.583 --> 00:35:55.792
- You moved the ball more than six inches.

622
00:35:55.792 --> 00:35:57.291
that's a penalty.

623
00:35:57.291 --> 00:35:58.291
- You didn't have a ruler.

624
00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:00.667
You guesstimated and guesstimated wrong.

625
00:36:01.542 --> 00:36:03.041
- Why are you getting so mad?

626
00:36:03.041 --> 00:36:06.166
- Because it was under six inches.

627
00:36:06.166 --> 00:36:08.000
- So why don't your parents like me?

628
00:36:10.166 --> 00:36:13.333
- The first and only time
I took you meet them.

629
00:36:13.333 --> 00:36:14.208
you brought it up.

630
00:36:14.208 --> 00:36:16.166
In fact. you spent the entire night

631
00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:18.041
talking about me cheating in mini golf.

632
00:36:18.041 --> 00:36:19.291
- They seemed interested.

633
00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:20.250
- Not interested.

634
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.583
You went on and on
about the six inch rule.

635
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.375
- So that's why we broke up?

636
00:36:25.375 --> 00:36:26.208
- Yes.

637
00:36:27.583 --> 00:36:28.417
Mostly.

638
00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:38.709
- Wow.

639
00:36:39.875 --> 00:36:41.709
I am really sorry. Molly.

640
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.166
- I appreciate that.

641
00:36:48.166 --> 00:36:51.208
- I get the competitive
thing from my brother.

642
00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:53.417
He's the six five muscular version of me.

643
00:36:54.542 --> 00:36:56.041
The only way I could ever win at anything

644
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:57.917
is if he cheated and I could prove it.

645
00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:00.500
- Siblings can be tough.

646
00:37:04.834 --> 00:37:06.959
- But six inches is six inches. cheater.

647
00:37:08.291 --> 00:37:09.125
Sorry.

648
00:37:10.208 --> 00:37:11.208
- That wasn't funny.

649
00:37:14.208 --> 00:37:15.166
- It's sorta funny.

650
00:37:18.208 --> 00:37:19.875
- How good are you at Ms. Pacman?

651
00:37:20.709 --> 00:37:23.792
(video game beeping)

652
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.333
You know. you look good.

653
00:37:33.333 --> 00:37:34.333
- Thank you.

654
00:37:35.458 --> 00:37:36.917
You look amazing.

655
00:37:36.917 --> 00:37:38.458
Like even better than before.

656
00:37:38.458 --> 00:37:40.250
- [Molly] Okay. no more ass kissing.

657
00:37:42.959 --> 00:37:43.792
- Dating anyone?

658
00:37:44.667 --> 00:37:45.792
- Sort of.

659
00:37:45.792 --> 00:37:47.291
It's convenient for now.

660
00:37:47.291 --> 00:37:49.291
I'm so busy at work.

661
00:37:51.542 --> 00:37:52.542
- [Jason] What do you do?

662
00:37:52.542 --> 00:37:55.250
- Property management. 300 units.

663
00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:58.667
- Sounds like 300 problems.

664
00:38:00.041 --> 00:38:00.875
- You got it.

665
00:38:02.375 --> 00:38:04.750
Last year I bought my
first apartment building.

666
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:06.583
- Nice.

667
00:38:06.583 --> 00:38:09.250
- Six units over in Arcadia.
not far from old town.

668
00:38:10.792 --> 00:38:12.917
- You gonna be the next
real estate tycoon?

669
00:38:13.792 --> 00:38:14.625
- We'll see.

670
00:38:19.375 --> 00:38:20.750
What are you doing tonight?

671
00:38:23.125 --> 00:38:25.792
- I was thinking we could
go play some mini golf.

672
00:38:25.792 --> 00:38:27.291
- You're an idiot.

673
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:31.875
- No. I'm visiting another one of my exes.

674
00:38:31.875 --> 00:38:33.083
I dated her before you.

675
00:38:35.083 --> 00:38:38.625
- Oh. so you didn't come
here just to see me?

676
00:38:40.333 --> 00:38:42.333
- No. I'm doing a whole road trip thing.

677
00:38:43.417 --> 00:38:44.375
- To see your exes?

678
00:38:45.667 --> 00:38:46.500
- Yup.

679
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.583
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

680
00:38:58.625 --> 00:39:01.291
(phone chiming)

681
00:39:16.583 --> 00:39:20.000
(dramatic country music)

682
00:39:28.542 --> 00:39:29.542
- Are you Jason?

683
00:39:31.041 --> 00:39:32.583
- Yes.

684
00:39:32.583 --> 00:39:33.417
Do I know you?

685
00:39:34.917 --> 00:39:36.250
- What are you doing here?

686
00:39:38.458 --> 00:39:40.000
- I'm meeting a friend.

687
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.750
- I know that. why?

688
00:39:46.625 --> 00:39:49.166
- She's a friend from a few years ago.

689
00:39:49.166 --> 00:39:50.291
- Hey. Einstein.

690
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:53.208
You've answered everything
expect my fucking question.

691
00:39:53.208 --> 00:39:54.709
- I see you've met Angela.

692
00:39:57.083 --> 00:39:59.417
- Oh. we were just getting
to know each other.

693
00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:03.250
- We live together.

694
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:08.166
- Oh. we didn't get that
far in the conversation.

695
00:40:09.166 --> 00:40:11.208
- I met Jason in high school.

696
00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:13.250
He was the nicest guy.

697
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:14.542
- I bet he was.

698
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.417
- I saw her again in college.

699
00:40:20.417 --> 00:40:22.959
- My car battery died and
he offered to jump me.

700
00:40:22.959 --> 00:40:23.917
- I bet he did.

701
00:40:23.917 --> 00:40:25.208
What are we doing here?

702
00:40:27.375 --> 00:40:28.750
- She's so jealous.

703
00:40:31.709 --> 00:40:35.041
- Oh. I didn't realize
you're together together.

704
00:40:36.166 --> 00:40:37.750
I'm no threat.

705
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:40.083
In fact. I'm getting married.

706
00:40:40.083 --> 00:40:41.875
- Let me see a photo.

707
00:40:41.875 --> 00:40:42.709
- What?

708
00:40:43.917 --> 00:40:44.917
- If you're getting married to this girl

709
00:40:44.917 --> 00:40:46.792
you have to have few pictures of her.

710
00:40:47.917 --> 00:40:48.917
- All right.

711
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
- Are you satisfied?

712
00:41:07.625 --> 00:41:09.333
You're gonna be late for work. go.

713
00:41:12.333 --> 00:41:13.625
- It was nice to meet you.

714
00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.333
- Likewise.

715
00:41:22.417 --> 00:41:23.250
- Chug your beer.

716
00:41:24.208 --> 00:41:25.417
- We're done?

717
00:41:25.417 --> 00:41:26.458
- I've been here all day.

718
00:41:26.458 --> 00:41:27.667
Let's go somewhere else.

719
00:41:30.875 --> 00:41:32.917
- [Jason] So how long
you been dating girls?

720
00:41:32.917 --> 00:41:34.583
- Pretty much always.

721
00:41:34.583 --> 00:41:36.709
You're the only guy I went out with.

722
00:41:36.709 --> 00:41:37.542
- No.

723
00:41:37.542 --> 00:41:38.375
- Yeah.

724
00:41:39.667 --> 00:41:41.125
- Why me?

725
00:41:41.125 --> 00:41:43.875
- Well. my mom liked you

726
00:41:43.875 --> 00:41:47.250
and remember when we went to prom?

727
00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:50.542
My mom was so happy to
put up the prom pics

728
00:41:50.542 --> 00:41:51.500
in the living room.

729
00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:57.041
- Does your mom know now?

730
00:41:57.041 --> 00:41:57.917
- She always knew.

731
00:41:57.917 --> 00:41:59.667
She was kinda just waiting on me.

732
00:42:02.959 --> 00:42:05.291
- You only dated me to
make your mom happy?

733
00:42:05.291 --> 00:42:07.500
- Oh. gosh no. that came out wrong.

734
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.333
I always liked being with you.

735
00:42:10.333 --> 00:42:13.709
You always were real.

736
00:42:16.083 --> 00:42:17.041
- To being real.

737
00:42:17.041 --> 00:42:18.000
- To being real.

738
00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:28.834
- Out of all my girlfriends.
you were really my best friend.

739
00:42:29.792 --> 00:42:31.291
There was always something about us

740
00:42:31.291 --> 00:42:33.583
that was just so in sync.

741
00:42:33.583 --> 00:42:35.333
- That's 'cause we both like pussy.

742
00:42:37.083 --> 00:42:38.250
- To pussy.

743
00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:39.375
- I'll drink to that.

744
00:42:43.458 --> 00:42:45.750
And have it for dessert later. too.

745
00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:52.792
- [Veronica] So we know
that you say I love you

746
00:42:52.792 --> 00:42:54.458
way too early.

747
00:42:54.458 --> 00:42:55.542
- Correct.

748
00:42:55.542 --> 00:42:58.083
- [Veronica] And that you
are a stickler for rules.

749
00:42:58.083 --> 00:42:59.625
- Maybe a bit too much.

750
00:43:02.125 --> 00:43:03.625
- And that moms like you

751
00:43:03.625 --> 00:43:06.375
except when your obsessions for rules

752
00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:07.667
shows its ugly face.

753
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.583
- And the girlfriend that I
thought I was closest with

754
00:43:10.583 --> 00:43:12.083
was actually just a friend.

755
00:43:15.583 --> 00:43:17.041
- Are you having a good time?

756
00:43:19.125 --> 00:43:21.125
- It's a little outside my comfort zone.

757
00:43:22.083 --> 00:43:23.417
But I'm glad I'm doing it.

758
00:43:24.709 --> 00:43:25.542
- Good.

759
00:43:27.583 --> 00:43:28.458
- So.

760
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.834
What did you do tonight?

761
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.083
- I went on a date.

762
00:43:38.125 --> 00:43:38.959
- Oh.

763
00:43:40.625 --> 00:43:41.458
Great.

764
00:43:42.875 --> 00:43:44.458
- Yeah.

765
00:43:44.458 --> 00:43:45.709
It was okay.

766
00:43:45.709 --> 00:43:46.750
Do you want details?

767
00:43:49.083 --> 00:43:51.709
- Nah. I'm up early tomorrow
and heading back to LA.

768
00:43:54.709 --> 00:43:56.250
- Kate.

769
00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:57.083
- Kate.

770
00:43:58.917 --> 00:44:00.458
I'm gonna get some sleep.

771
00:44:01.375 --> 00:44:03.041
- Hey. Jason.

772
00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:04.291
- [Jason] Yeah?

773
00:44:08.792 --> 00:44:11.625
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.

774
00:44:11.625 --> 00:44:12.458
Goodnight.

775
00:44:13.458 --> 00:44:14.291
- Night.

776
00:44:22.834 --> 00:44:25.750
(Veronica sighing)

777
00:44:33.583 --> 00:44:36.583
(soft guitar music)

778
00:45:05.458 --> 00:45:08.125
(horns beeping)

779
00:45:09.917 --> 00:45:12.917
(upbeat rock music)

780
00:46:07.291 --> 00:46:09.959
(Jason panting)

781
00:46:25.709 --> 00:46:27.166
- Jason?

782
00:46:27.166 --> 00:46:28.125
- Hey. Kate.

783
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.166
- Hey.

784
00:46:30.166 --> 00:46:31.542
How are you?

785
00:46:31.542 --> 00:46:32.875
Sorry. I'm all sweaty.

786
00:46:32.875 --> 00:46:33.709
- Me. too.

787
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.583
- Not like we haven't been
sweaty together. before.

788
00:46:37.583 --> 00:46:39.166
- I remember.

789
00:46:39.166 --> 00:46:40.709
Sex in Arizona.

790
00:46:43.083 --> 00:46:46.166
- Oh. I meant living in Arizona.

791
00:46:46.166 --> 00:46:48.333
- Oh. I just thought.

792
00:46:49.542 --> 00:46:51.125
- It's good to see you.

793
00:46:51.125 --> 00:46:52.291
Do you live around here?

794
00:46:53.542 --> 00:46:55.458
- No. I'm in Culver City

795
00:46:55.458 --> 00:46:57.333
but I like trying new places to run.

796
00:46:57.333 --> 00:46:58.166
- [Kate] Yeah.

797
00:46:58.166 --> 00:46:59.000
- Gotta stay fit.

798
00:47:01.041 --> 00:47:03.250
- Well. it was great seeing you again.

799
00:47:07.041 --> 00:47:09.125
We should catch up sometime.

800
00:47:09.125 --> 00:47:10.959
- How 'bout right now?

801
00:47:15.959 --> 00:47:17.959
- Yeah. I guess.

802
00:47:18.917 --> 00:47:20.250
- We can do it another day.

803
00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:23.709
You probably have plans.

804
00:47:23.709 --> 00:47:24.959
- No. it's my day off.

805
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.333
- You sure?

806
00:47:30.875 --> 00:47:31.709
- Yeah.

807
00:47:39.458 --> 00:47:41.041
- How?

808
00:47:41.041 --> 00:47:43.417
I haven't been able to
find this anywhere in LA.

809
00:47:43.417 --> 00:47:44.250
- I know.

810
00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:48.333
I found it in some random
little shop in Echo Park.

811
00:47:48.333 --> 00:47:50.834
You got me addicted to this stuff.

812
00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:52.709
- I haven't had one of these in years.

813
00:47:58.125 --> 00:47:58.959
- So good.

814
00:48:09.417 --> 00:48:11.250
- Do you remember our first date?

815
00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:13.417
I bought a six pack of Chihuahua.

816
00:48:13.417 --> 00:48:15.709
sat in your convertible till sunrise.

817
00:48:15.709 --> 00:48:16.875
Talked about all the great things

818
00:48:16.875 --> 00:48:17.709
we were gonna do.

819
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.041
- Yeah.

820
00:48:20.041 --> 00:48:24.417
Yeah. you said that space
travel was gonna make a return

821
00:48:24.417 --> 00:48:25.375
and you were gonna be the guy

822
00:48:25.375 --> 00:48:28.125
who was in the belly of
the beast when it happened.

823
00:48:28.125 --> 00:48:30.041
- How do you remember that?

824
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:30.959
- It's a gift.

825
00:48:33.375 --> 00:48:36.083
So what did you actually end up doing?

826
00:48:36.083 --> 00:48:37.750
- I'm in the space program.

827
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:38.917
- Shut the fuck up.

828
00:48:40.125 --> 00:48:41.834
So I've had sex with an astronaut.

829
00:48:43.041 --> 00:48:46.208
- I wish I could check
that off your bucket list.

830
00:48:46.208 --> 00:48:48.583
I'm the flight director
at Rocket Dynamics.

831
00:48:48.583 --> 00:48:51.083
Our rockets put satellites in orbit.

832
00:48:51.083 --> 00:48:52.750
- You know. I don't know anyone

833
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:54.583
who actually did what they wanted to.

834
00:48:55.458 --> 00:48:56.458
But you always knew.

835
00:48:57.959 --> 00:49:00.500
- You were my only girlfriend
who thought it was cool.

836
00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.625
- I did.

837
00:49:01.625 --> 00:49:03.625
I mean it would be way cooler

838
00:49:03.625 --> 00:49:05.417
if you were actually astronaut. but.

839
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.208
I'm really proud of you.

840
00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.667
- You were the most driven
person I've ever met.

841
00:49:14.667 --> 00:49:15.834
What are you doing now?

842
00:49:22.166 --> 00:49:24.917
- Are you hungry at all?

843
00:49:34.166 --> 00:49:36.083
- We have a cool new rocket coming up.

844
00:49:37.166 --> 00:49:38.417
- What's it called?

845
00:49:38.417 --> 00:49:40.041
- The A7.

846
00:49:40.041 --> 00:49:42.625
- Nice. and so how fast
do these rockets go?

847
00:49:42.625 --> 00:49:44.875
- Top speed is 27.000 kilometers an hour.

848
00:49:46.291 --> 00:49:47.834
- Unreal.

849
00:49:47.834 --> 00:49:49.500
And what do you do?

850
00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.333
- I'm the guy that says go for launch.

851
00:49:52.333 --> 00:49:55.083
But if I say go. I better
not have messed up.

852
00:49:56.709 --> 00:49:58.000
- I'm impressed.

853
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.041
And you know I'm not easily impressed.

854
00:50:00.041 --> 00:50:01.291
- Oh. I remember.

855
00:50:02.917 --> 00:50:06.250
Our fourth date and still no sex.

856
00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:07.375
You made me show you something

857
00:50:07.375 --> 00:50:09.125
that made me worthy of your vagina.

858
00:50:10.208 --> 00:50:12.500
- It wasn't like that.

859
00:50:13.792 --> 00:50:15.875
But my vagina is worth it.

860
00:50:15.875 --> 00:50:18.083
You needed to impress and you did.

861
00:50:19.625 --> 00:50:21.625
- It's one of the few things I'm good at

862
00:50:24.375 --> 00:50:26.625
and definitely not sexy. though.

863
00:50:26.625 --> 00:50:28.542
- Yeah. no. not sexy.

864
00:50:31.583 --> 00:50:32.458
- But it worked.

865
00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:49.083
What?

866
00:50:51.208 --> 00:50:52.875
You still have it?

867
00:50:52.875 --> 00:50:54.458
- It was a gift. why wouldn't I?

868
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:09.375
You still got it?

869
00:51:11.083 --> 00:51:12.792
- It may not be as impressive now.

870
00:51:13.709 --> 00:51:16.208
- Yeah. I'll be the judge of that one.

871
00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:30.458
(dramatic electronic music)

872
00:51:44.291 --> 00:51:46.333
- Not bad for out of practice.

873
00:51:49.291 --> 00:51:53.250
- Come here.

874
00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:54.500
- [Jason] What?

875
00:51:55.333 --> 00:51:56.333
- Come here.

876
00:52:04.667 --> 00:52:07.041
So I hope you don't mind but

877
00:52:07.041 --> 00:52:09.834
I'm going to say I've had
sex with an astronaut.

878
00:52:09.834 --> 00:52:10.667
- Fine with me.

879
00:52:19.208 --> 00:52:21.542
- I probably should have asked.

880
00:52:22.458 --> 00:52:23.625
Are you seeing anybody?

881
00:52:25.417 --> 00:52:26.250
- I was.

882
00:52:28.333 --> 00:52:30.333
In fact. I almost asked her to marry me.

883
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000
- And what happened?

884
00:52:35.041 --> 00:52:37.125
- She was having sex with my old roommate.

885
00:52:41.542 --> 00:52:42.375
- I'm sorry.

886
00:52:45.083 --> 00:52:47.542
- Enough about me. what about you?

887
00:52:50.542 --> 00:52:52.166
- Do you remember what my plan was?

888
00:52:52.166 --> 00:52:53.000
- Totally.

889
00:52:54.291 --> 00:52:55.875
- I bet we remember differently.

890
00:52:58.583 --> 00:53:01.875
- Our junior year at
ASU. before Christmas.

891
00:53:01.875 --> 00:53:04.041
you told me you wanted to be the head

892
00:53:04.041 --> 00:53:07.583
of Media Relations at
a Fortune 100 company.

893
00:53:07.583 --> 00:53:10.041
Not 500 but 100.

894
00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:12.291
- That's pretty good.

895
00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:14.500
Do you remember why?

896
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.583
- You loved when a company
like that got in trouble.

897
00:53:19.542 --> 00:53:22.041
The media relations person would come out

898
00:53:22.041 --> 00:53:25.583
and put a public spin on it so crafted.

899
00:53:25.583 --> 00:53:28.000
it made the whole public
regain confidence again

900
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.750
and the stock holders relaxed.

901
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:33.166
(soft music)

902
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:49.834
I'm sorry.

903
00:53:51.083 --> 00:53:52.083
Did I say something?

904
00:54:04.208 --> 00:54:06.792
(door closing)

905
00:54:17.417 --> 00:54:20.041
- I just freaked you out. didn't I?

906
00:54:20.041 --> 00:54:20.875
- No.

907
00:54:22.875 --> 00:54:23.709
- Jason.

908
00:54:24.959 --> 00:54:25.792
- A bit.

909
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:28.792
Okay. you freaked me out.

910
00:54:31.417 --> 00:54:32.250
What did I say?

911
00:54:34.166 --> 00:54:35.417
- Okay. I'm gonna tell you something

912
00:54:35.417 --> 00:54:38.375
that I've never told anyone. okay?

913
00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:39.208
- Okay.

914
00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:47.291
- My freshman year I was
broke and had to make tuition.

915
00:54:48.208 --> 00:54:49.500
- You were on a full ride.

916
00:54:50.959 --> 00:54:53.083
- No. not the first year.

917
00:54:53.083 --> 00:54:53.959
I had to earn it.

918
00:54:55.208 --> 00:54:57.083
So. by Christmas I was broke.

919
00:54:58.041 --> 00:55:01.000
Tuition. housing was
due. I had to buy books

920
00:55:02.875 --> 00:55:06.083
and I found out that a
bunch of girls in the dorm

921
00:55:06.083 --> 00:55:07.208
had sugar daddies.

922
00:55:09.834 --> 00:55:13.709
But instead. I started doing cam modeling.

923
00:55:13.709 --> 00:55:15.500
No modeling required.

924
00:55:17.291 --> 00:55:20.834
I would get men off in private chats.

925
00:55:23.709 --> 00:55:25.458
You don't wanna hear this. do you?

926
00:55:25.458 --> 00:55:26.792
- You can tell me anything.

927
00:55:27.625 --> 00:55:29.792
- Well. after the first few days

928
00:55:29.792 --> 00:55:32.792
I figured out a way to
make a lot of money.

929
00:55:32.792 --> 00:55:35.625
The longer I could keep
guys on a private session.

930
00:55:35.625 --> 00:55:36.458
the more I made.

931
00:55:36.458 --> 00:55:39.542
So I got really good
at controlling the pace

932
00:55:40.458 --> 00:55:43.542
and after two months. I
paid off all my bills.

933
00:55:43.542 --> 00:55:45.458
I quit. I finished top of my class

934
00:55:45.458 --> 00:55:46.750
and I was on my way.

935
00:55:54.291 --> 00:55:58.875
And of all people. I didn't
prepare for damage control.

936
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.375
My first big interview
after college was amazing.

937
00:56:04.583 --> 00:56:06.208
You know. I got offered a great salary.

938
00:56:06.208 --> 00:56:10.375
stock options. benefits.

939
00:56:10.375 --> 00:56:11.709
Pending a background check.

940
00:56:16.125 --> 00:56:17.667
- But how did they find out?

941
00:56:17.667 --> 00:56:19.291
You didn't use your real name. did you?

942
00:56:19.291 --> 00:56:20.125
- No.

943
00:56:21.208 --> 00:56:24.458
Where I fucked up is I used
a photo from my cam profile

944
00:56:24.458 --> 00:56:25.917
from a Cancun vacation.

945
00:56:26.834 --> 00:56:28.959
That same photo is on my
Instagram and Facebook.

946
00:56:29.875 --> 00:56:31.166
- Reverse image search.

947
00:56:35.375 --> 00:56:38.542
- Every interview after that
was pretty much the same.

948
00:56:38.542 --> 00:56:39.959
I was the most qualified
person in the room

949
00:56:39.959 --> 00:56:41.291
until the background check.

950
00:56:42.417 --> 00:56:44.750
Sometimes I'd get a. you know.

951
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:47.208
thank you but no thank you email.

952
00:56:47.208 --> 00:56:49.583
But usually I was just ghosted.

953
00:56:49.583 --> 00:56:50.417
- I'm sorry.

954
00:56:51.834 --> 00:56:54.166
But your so talented.

955
00:56:54.166 --> 00:56:58.583
Fuck Fortune 100. 200. how 'bout 500?

956
00:56:59.542 --> 00:57:00.875
- Keep going.

957
00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:03.208
I finally got hired at
a Fortune 1.000 company.

958
00:57:04.583 --> 00:57:06.166
Took 'em two months to find out.

959
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:09.000
Got fired and walked to my car.

960
00:57:10.458 --> 00:57:12.583
The boss said he was sorry

961
00:57:12.583 --> 00:57:15.417
and then he hit on me. right
there in the parking lot.

962
00:57:21.375 --> 00:57:23.041
I need a drink.

963
00:57:23.041 --> 00:57:26.375
(soft reflective music)

964
00:57:36.417 --> 00:57:40.583
Well. all I have left
are Rita's Mangoritas.

965
00:58:02.208 --> 00:58:03.458
What?

966
00:58:03.458 --> 00:58:06.959
- I wish you could see
you the way I see you.

967
00:58:11.792 --> 00:58:12.625
- Jason.

968
00:58:14.792 --> 00:58:17.875
I may have made a mistake
not keeping you in my life.

969
00:58:18.709 --> 00:58:20.166
- It never would have worked.

970
00:58:21.792 --> 00:58:22.625
- Really?

971
00:58:24.166 --> 00:58:26.041
- Us astronauts get the ladies.

972
00:58:27.375 --> 00:58:28.458
What can I say?

973
00:58:31.291 --> 00:58:33.000
- Well. I'm really glad you're here.

974
00:58:34.875 --> 00:58:35.709
- Me too.

975
00:58:44.083 --> 00:58:47.000
(soft rock music)

976
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:47.834
- Hey?

977
00:58:48.917 --> 00:58:49.750
Are you home?

978
00:58:50.625 --> 00:58:52.417
I went past your place last night.

979
00:58:52.417 --> 00:58:54.667
- Oh. I'm just leaving Kate's now.

980
00:58:58.333 --> 00:58:59.417
Hello?

981
00:58:59.417 --> 00:59:02.000
- Well. what did you learn
from sleeping with Kate?

982
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.041
- Who says we slept together?

983
00:59:04.041 --> 00:59:07.250
- Oh. I'm sorry. I thought that...

984
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:08.709
- We did. several times.

985
00:59:09.583 --> 00:59:14.208
- Well. you might just go
for a trifecta this week.

986
00:59:14.208 --> 00:59:16.208
- Well. this was all your idea.

987
00:59:16.208 --> 00:59:18.792
Why are you getting so upset at me?

988
00:59:18.792 --> 00:59:19.625
I'm going home.

989
00:59:19.625 --> 00:59:21.166
- No. no. you've come this far.

990
00:59:21.166 --> 00:59:26.166
just go see Izzy and try
to keep it in your pants.

991
00:59:26.542 --> 00:59:27.917
- Nothing's gonna happen with her.

992
00:59:27.917 --> 00:59:29.625
she's the shy one.

993
00:59:29.625 --> 00:59:31.750
We dated for like a month
before doing anything

994
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:33.625
and never with the lights on.

995
00:59:33.625 --> 00:59:35.250
- Why?

996
00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:38.583
- She was a little heavy and
it's always bothered her.

997
00:59:38.583 --> 00:59:39.959
She's really sweet. though.

998
00:59:41.375 --> 00:59:42.583
- So why'd you break up?

999
00:59:44.291 --> 00:59:45.250
- I don't know.

1000
00:59:47.208 --> 00:59:48.458
- You know what.

1001
00:59:48.458 --> 00:59:51.542
Go see Izzy. found out. and then call me.

1002
00:59:51.542 --> 00:59:54.166
Okay. I want a full debriefing tonight.

1003
00:59:54.166 --> 00:59:55.959
- Okay. but you can't get mad at me.

1004
00:59:58.125 --> 00:59:58.959
- Call me.

1005
01:00:00.834 --> 01:00:03.834
(upbeat rock music)

1006
01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:20.834
(door bell ringing)

1007
01:00:20.834 --> 01:00:22.500
- [Izzy] Just a sec!

1008
01:00:25.125 --> 01:00:27.375
- Hi. does Izzy still live here?

1009
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:31.834
- Jason?

1010
01:00:34.291 --> 01:00:35.125
- Izzy?

1011
01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:37.542
- What are you doing here?

1012
01:00:39.875 --> 01:00:40.834
- Funny story.

1013
01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:48.375
- So. why do you think that we broke up?

1014
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.208
- I can't remember.

1015
01:00:54.208 --> 01:00:55.125
You were always so nice

1016
01:00:55.125 --> 01:00:57.375
I don't even remember
arguing about anything.

1017
01:00:58.709 --> 01:01:02.333
- I used to please men by being agreeable.

1018
01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:06.166
We can eat wherever. that movie's fine.

1019
01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:08.041
Another blow job. sure.

1020
01:01:08.041 --> 01:01:10.667
It's not like I'm busy
studying or anything.

1021
01:01:15.041 --> 01:01:17.500
- But with me specifically.
do you remember?

1022
01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:22.834
- I remember everything
about every guy I've dated.

1023
01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:24.625
Pigs.

1024
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.583
- Did I treat you bad?

1025
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.834
- Nothing major.

1026
01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:36.250
When you shaved. you would
leave all those little hairs

1027
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:38.917
in the sink and after you ate.

1028
01:01:38.917 --> 01:01:41.875
you would take your plate
and put it on the counter

1029
01:01:41.875 --> 01:01:45.166
on top of the dishwasher.

1030
01:01:45.166 --> 01:01:47.250
And I know that this is picky

1031
01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:49.250
but you would leave your dirty socks

1032
01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:50.250
next to the hamper.

1033
01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:53.375
Not even next to it. touching the hamper.

1034
01:01:55.208 --> 01:01:56.875
- Why didn't you say something?

1035
01:01:56.875 --> 01:01:59.041
- Because I'm a sucker.

1036
01:01:59.041 --> 01:02:00.542
Every time we had sex.

1037
01:02:00.542 --> 01:02:03.291
it started off with me
giving you a blow job.

1038
01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:05.500
How 'bout returning the favor?

1039
01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.333
- I did.

1040
01:02:08.417 --> 01:02:09.500
Twice?

1041
01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:11.250
- Twice.

1042
01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:14.458
And I used to send you these cute texts

1043
01:02:14.458 --> 01:02:17.083
with specific things
that I loved about you

1044
01:02:17.083 --> 01:02:19.792
just to make your day a little bit better.

1045
01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:22.375
- They did.

1046
01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:23.875
- Then send something back better

1047
01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:25.917
than a fucking thumbs up emoji.

1048
01:02:28.792 --> 01:02:29.709
- I'm sorry. Izzy.

1049
01:02:30.959 --> 01:02:31.834
I didn't know.

1050
01:02:35.458 --> 01:02:38.250
- It's okay. men are stupid.

1051
01:02:41.542 --> 01:02:46.542
- So. what do you do for work?

1052
01:02:50.792 --> 01:02:51.959
- How 'bout I show you?

1053
01:02:57.166 --> 01:03:00.166
(upbeat drum music)

1054
01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.375
You wanna try it?

1055
01:03:11.417 --> 01:03:12.375
No charge.

1056
01:03:14.542 --> 01:03:16.375
- It's not my thing.

1057
01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:18.792
- How would you do if
you've never tried it?

1058
01:03:21.166 --> 01:03:23.583
- I'm pretty sure I wouldn't like it.

1059
01:03:23.583 --> 01:03:25.875
- You're a fucking pussy.

1060
01:03:25.875 --> 01:03:27.041
- What?

1061
01:03:27.041 --> 01:03:28.959
- I can loan you some of my panties

1062
01:03:28.959 --> 01:03:31.583
in case you're feeling
a little vulnerable.

1063
01:03:31.583 --> 01:03:33.208
- No. I just-

1064
01:03:33.208 --> 01:03:34.542
- I said try it!

1065
01:03:34.542 --> 01:03:35.375
- Okay.

1066
01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:45.083
- We're going to need to
come up with a safe word.

1067
01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:46.291
How about

1068
01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.166
Izzy is my master.

1069
01:03:54.834 --> 01:03:56.500
- Izzy is my master.

1070
01:04:00.709 --> 01:04:05.709
- And after we're done shaving.
we're gonna clean it up.

1071
01:04:06.041 --> 01:04:06.959
Aren't we?

1072
01:04:09.125 --> 01:04:11.250
(muffled grunts)

1073
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:12.083
Good.

1074
01:04:14.125 --> 01:04:15.291
Dirty dishes

1075
01:04:17.709 --> 01:04:21.083
go into the dishwasher. don't they?

1076
01:04:21.083 --> 01:04:21.917
- Yeah.

1077
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.375
- Dirty socks.

1078
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:35.041
We drop them into the hamper.

1079
01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:36.291
Don't we?

1080
01:04:36.291 --> 01:04:37.250
- Yeah.

1081
01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:39.750
Izzy. Izzy is my master.

1082
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:41.250
Izzy is my master.

1083
01:04:45.542 --> 01:04:47.709
- And when we have sex with our partner.

1084
01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:50.959
we're gonna satisfy them first.

1085
01:04:50.959 --> 01:04:53.250
every time.

1086
01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:54.709
Aren't we. lover?

1087
01:04:54.709 --> 01:04:56.041
- Yes. yes. yes.

1088
01:04:57.041 --> 01:04:58.709
- Don't worry. baby.

1089
01:04:58.709 --> 01:05:00.000
No more spanking.

1090
01:05:02.792 --> 01:05:04.250
You've earned something else.

1091
01:05:12.792 --> 01:05:16.917
Have you ever wondered what it's like

1092
01:05:16.917 --> 01:05:21.917
to get fucked and receive
absolutely zero pleasure?

1093
01:05:23.333 --> 01:05:28.333
- Izzy is my master. Izzy is my master.

1094
01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:31.500
- This is gonna hurt a little.

1095
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:34.417
(muffled shouting)

1096
01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:43.834
(Jason groaning)

1097
01:05:48.959 --> 01:05:51.792
(phone vibrating)

1098
01:05:53.375 --> 01:05:54.375
- Hey.
- Hey.

1099
01:05:55.375 --> 01:05:56.208
- How'd it go?

1100
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:58.583
- It was painful.

1101
01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:04.625
- Did you hit the trifecta?

1102
01:06:05.917 --> 01:06:07.375
- I wanna tell you in person.

1103
01:06:07.375 --> 01:06:09.542
Could I meet you somewhere?

1104
01:06:09.542 --> 01:06:11.041
- Yeah. I'm about to head out.

1105
01:06:12.083 --> 01:06:14.750
- Well. meet me at Lansing Park.

1106
01:06:15.709 --> 01:06:19.542
- Okay. Lansing Park. 30 minutes.

1107
01:06:20.625 --> 01:06:21.667
- Hey. Vee.

1108
01:06:21.667 --> 01:06:22.542
- [Veronica] Yeah?

1109
01:06:23.792 --> 01:06:24.625
- I missed you.

1110
01:06:26.041 --> 01:06:28.208
I hope that's not weird.

1111
01:06:28.208 --> 01:06:29.041
- No.

1112
01:06:30.625 --> 01:06:31.458
Me. too.

1113
01:06:33.333 --> 01:06:34.166
- All right.

1114
01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:37.083
- Bye.

1115
01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:55.041
(knocking at door)

1116
01:07:06.417 --> 01:07:08.208
- What are you doing here?

1117
01:07:08.208 --> 01:07:09.083
- We need to talk.

1118
01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:12.709
- How'd you now I was here?

1119
01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:13.583
(Benji groaning)

1120
01:07:13.583 --> 01:07:15.041
- Where is he?

1121
01:07:15.959 --> 01:07:17.333
- I can't tell you.

1122
01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:18.333
(bones creaking)

1123
01:07:18.333 --> 01:07:19.750
Lansing Park. Lansing Park.

1124
01:07:21.125 --> 01:07:21.959
- Sit.

1125
01:07:27.709 --> 01:07:30.959
First. I want to say
sorry about what happened

1126
01:07:30.959 --> 01:07:33.375
and I want us to forget all that. okay?

1127
01:07:35.333 --> 01:07:36.166
- Okay.

1128
01:07:37.709 --> 01:07:38.542
Why?

1129
01:07:39.709 --> 01:07:42.542
- Well. over the last few days.

1130
01:07:42.542 --> 01:07:45.375
I asked myself. what do I want?

1131
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.583
- Me?

1132
01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:50.250
- Not exactly.

1133
01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:52.667
But I realize I might have to compromise.

1134
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:58.166
You'll never be a Jason
Bateman or Jason Statham.

1135
01:07:58.166 --> 01:08:03.166
But you could be a Jason
Biggs or Jason Schwartzman.

1136
01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:04.834
I'm sure they're nice people.

1137
01:08:06.667 --> 01:08:09.000
- Where are you going with this?

1138
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.458
- Hello?

1139
01:08:10.458 --> 01:08:13.250
You're not very smart for
a rocket guy. are you?

1140
01:08:14.375 --> 01:08:16.750
Let's pick up where you
came over to propose

1141
01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:18.166
but instead of what happened.

1142
01:08:19.041 --> 01:08:20.625
- Kyle having butt sex with you.

1143
01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:23.667
- That is not being productive.

1144
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.583
Imagine you came in and
I was looking fabulous.

1145
01:08:29.583 --> 01:08:31.083
what would you have said to me?

1146
01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:37.041
- Hi. Melissa. you look great.

1147
01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:37.875
Are you hungry?

1148
01:08:37.875 --> 01:08:38.709
- No.

1149
01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:41.083
Do you have the ring?

1150
01:08:42.083 --> 01:08:43.250
- Yeah.

1151
01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:46.041
- Do the get down on one knee part.

1152
01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:46.875
with the ring.

1153
01:08:51.542 --> 01:08:54.625
- You know. a lot has happened
over the last few days.

1154
01:08:54.625 --> 01:08:56.125
I've been thinking a lot. too.

1155
01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.500
I think we might need to
spend some time apart.

1156
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.583
- Jason. please.

1157
01:09:03.083 --> 01:09:04.792
Do you know how hard it
was for me to come here

1158
01:09:04.792 --> 01:09:06.583
and admit that I was wrong?

1159
01:09:13.458 --> 01:09:16.375
(soft tense music)

1160
01:09:17.375 --> 01:09:19.166
- Melissa. over the last two years.

1161
01:09:19.166 --> 01:09:20.875
you've changed my life.

1162
01:09:20.875 --> 01:09:22.375
You've made me a better man

1163
01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:23.208
and helped focus-

1164
01:09:23.208 --> 01:09:25.291
- Yes. yes. I've heard this part.

1165
01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:26.125
Skip to the end.

1166
01:09:29.875 --> 01:09:32.208
- Melissa. will you
make me the happiest man

1167
01:09:32.208 --> 01:09:33.500
in the world and marry me?

1168
01:09:38.291 --> 01:09:39.125
- Huh.

1169
01:09:44.458 --> 01:09:45.291
Sure.

1170
01:09:51.667 --> 01:09:53.417
- Jason. what are you doing?

1171
01:09:55.959 --> 01:09:57.125
- [Melissa] Who are you?

1172
01:09:58.583 --> 01:10:00.542
- Well. she's just a girl from my work.

1173
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:06.166
- You two deserve each other.

1174
01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:12.333
- Did she just insult me?

1175
01:10:14.333 --> 01:10:15.208
Jason.

1176
01:10:16.125 --> 01:10:16.959
Look at me.

1177
01:10:21.291 --> 01:10:22.208
Who was that?

1178
01:10:23.792 --> 01:10:24.750
- I'm gonna go.

1179
01:10:26.792 --> 01:10:28.625
- I want some answers.

1180
01:10:34.667 --> 01:10:38.458
- Melissa. it's not you. it's me.

1181
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:42.583
Goodbye.

1182
01:10:44.333 --> 01:10:45.500
- You'll be back.

1183
01:10:51.417 --> 01:10:52.250
Asshole.

1184
01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.208
- So you messed up.

1185
01:10:58.208 --> 01:11:00.250
Call her. say you're sorry.

1186
01:11:01.959 --> 01:11:02.792
- I did.

1187
01:11:05.083 --> 01:11:05.917
- Text?

1188
01:11:06.959 --> 01:11:08.208
- I stopped after seven.

1189
01:11:09.583 --> 01:11:10.417
- Nothing?

1190
01:11:13.875 --> 01:11:16.542
Go to her house. buy her flowers.

1191
01:11:16.542 --> 01:11:18.875
and beg for forgiveness.

1192
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.792
- No. I'll see her at work tomorrow.

1193
01:11:31.583 --> 01:11:33.750
Whatever happened to
those three way girls?

1194
01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:38.125
- I couldn't get rid of them.

1195
01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:41.667
I had to fake a penis injury.

1196
01:11:43.375 --> 01:11:45.917
Then they lost all interest and left.

1197
01:11:47.166 --> 01:11:49.458
I discovered I'm a one girl guy.

1198
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:51.709
- Crazy week.

1199
01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:54.291
- Tomorrow is a new day.

1200
01:11:55.542 --> 01:11:57.709
Things always work out
the way they should.

1201
01:12:05.291 --> 01:12:07.458
- Diane is gonna help get
the presentation finished

1202
01:12:07.458 --> 01:12:09.500
until Veronica gets back.

1203
01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.583
- What. where's Veronica?

1204
01:12:12.625 --> 01:12:14.125
- You haven't talked with her?

1205
01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:15.834
I assumed you knew before I did.

1206
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:17.834
- Knew what?

1207
01:12:18.917 --> 01:12:22.000
- So. where are we with the changes?

1208
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.041
- I wanna score the presentation.

1209
01:12:24.959 --> 01:12:29.375
Stock music sounds sort of stock.

1210
01:12:29.375 --> 01:12:31.667
- Wait. when is she coming back?

1211
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:34.166
- I didn't talk to her.

1212
01:12:34.166 --> 01:12:35.959
Are you good changing the music?

1213
01:12:35.959 --> 01:12:38.166
- Wait. where is she?

1214
01:12:38.166 --> 01:12:41.500
- Jason. I had her job before she did.

1215
01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:42.500
I got this.

1216
01:12:46.542 --> 01:12:47.875
- Where are you going?

1217
01:12:47.875 --> 01:12:49.709
- I'm going to get Veronica back.

1218
01:12:49.709 --> 01:12:51.667
Without her there is no presentation.

1219
01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:54.208
No offense. Diana.

1220
01:12:56.166 --> 01:12:57.458
- Can't you just call her?

1221
01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:04.125
- That was a relationship reaction.

1222
01:13:04.125 --> 01:13:07.458
(muffled hip hop music)

1223
01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:15.375
(doorbell ringing)

1224
01:13:24.417 --> 01:13:25.250
- Veronica.

1225
01:13:26.208 --> 01:13:27.041
Can I explain?

1226
01:13:30.625 --> 01:13:31.542
I'm sorry.

1227
01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:35.959
I know it looked like I was proposing

1228
01:13:35.959 --> 01:13:37.875
but I wasn't gonna go through with it.

1229
01:13:39.875 --> 01:13:42.291
The truth is. the whole time I was gone.

1230
01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:46.083
the only one I was thinking of was you.

1231
01:13:50.917 --> 01:13:54.417
I don't know how I didn't
realize this sooner

1232
01:13:54.417 --> 01:13:55.709
but I love you. Vee.

1233
01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:00.291
I always have.

1234
01:14:00.291 --> 01:14:02.000
Since the first day I saw you.

1235
01:14:03.667 --> 01:14:05.875
I was just scared if we
got into a relationship

1236
01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:07.041
and it didn't work out.

1237
01:14:08.291 --> 01:14:09.709
No one stays friends.

1238
01:14:12.667 --> 01:14:14.417
Will you give me a chance. please?

1239
01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:24.417
- I think you blew it.

1240
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:26.834
- Who are you?

1241
01:14:27.667 --> 01:14:30.166
- I'm Carrie. Vee's sister.

1242
01:14:32.166 --> 01:14:34.792
Vee's been talking about
you for the last two years.

1243
01:14:36.041 --> 01:14:37.125
- To you?

1244
01:14:37.125 --> 01:14:39.542
- My whole freaking
family knows about Jason

1245
01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:40.834
from the party.

1246
01:14:42.041 --> 01:14:42.834
- What party?

1247
01:14:43.792 --> 01:14:47.250
- The 2018 Christmas party.

1248
01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:49.542
Heard it a thousand times.

1249
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.250
- What she say?

1250
01:14:56.834 --> 01:14:58.542
- That you and Vee snuck into the lounge

1251
01:14:58.542 --> 01:15:00.000
with a bottle of Jack.

1252
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.667
talked so long that
everyone at the party left.

1253
01:15:02.667 --> 01:15:03.542
- About right.

1254
01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:06.291
- Talked about family and kids

1255
01:15:08.083 --> 01:15:09.875
and when the time was right.

1256
01:15:09.875 --> 01:15:12.792
you looked into her eyes and
you leaned in for a kiss.

1257
01:15:13.917 --> 01:15:15.500
- You don't have to say it.

1258
01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.417
- And you threw up all over her and you.

1259
01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:22.834
- I'm bad with hard alcohol.

1260
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:25.709
- Obviously.

1261
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:26.709
And what did she do?

1262
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:29.333
She took you home. got you cleaned up.

1263
01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:30.834
and put you to bed.

1264
01:15:35.333 --> 01:15:37.166
You blew it.

1265
01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:38.750
At least you would have with me.

1266
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:42.542
But she still loves you.

1267
01:15:42.542 --> 01:15:43.500
I don't know why.

1268
01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:47.333
- She said that?

1269
01:15:47.333 --> 01:15:50.542
She said that out loud in a sentence?

1270
01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:54.542
- I have to be honest.
I'm not that impressed.

1271
01:15:55.792 --> 01:15:56.667
- Where is she?

1272
01:15:57.667 --> 01:16:00.166
- She went on a trip with this guy. Mitch.

1273
01:16:00.166 --> 01:16:02.875
He's been asking her out for months.

1274
01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:06.542
- Where?

1275
01:16:07.667 --> 01:16:09.083
- I promised not to tell you.

1276
01:16:11.291 --> 01:16:13.917
- I need to talk with her.

1277
01:16:13.917 --> 01:16:15.417
- Sorry. we're family.

1278
01:16:43.917 --> 01:16:44.750
- Dude!

1279
01:16:46.041 --> 01:16:47.208
- We need to talk.

1280
01:16:50.375 --> 01:16:52.333
I'm sorry how shit went down.

1281
01:16:56.542 --> 01:16:59.250
I'm your boy and I've had your back.

1282
01:17:00.667 --> 01:17:02.583
But you smell.

1283
01:17:02.583 --> 01:17:04.291
You're missing all your interviews

1284
01:17:05.875 --> 01:17:08.166
and I hear what goes on here every night.

1285
01:17:10.041 --> 01:17:10.875
- What?

1286
01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:13.500
- You want me to say it?

1287
01:17:16.583 --> 01:17:19.834
You're whacking off loudly or crying.

1288
01:17:20.834 --> 01:17:21.750
Usually both.

1289
01:17:28.083 --> 01:17:29.875
It's time to take a shower.

1290
01:17:29.875 --> 01:17:32.208
Call the people that for some reason

1291
01:17:32.208 --> 01:17:33.917
keep trying to interview you

1292
01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:38.792
and get on with life.

1293
01:17:42.542 --> 01:17:43.709
- You're a good friend.

1294
01:17:46.959 --> 01:17:48.959
- Yes. I am.

1295
01:17:48.959 --> 01:17:51.417
(knocking at door)

1296
01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:53.291
This is for your own good.

1297
01:17:55.417 --> 01:17:56.250
- Who is it?

1298
01:17:59.166 --> 01:18:00.000
Diana?

1299
01:18:01.041 --> 01:18:03.250
- You look horrible.

1300
01:18:03.250 --> 01:18:05.250
- [Jason] You came over to tell me that?

1301
01:18:06.458 --> 01:18:08.333
- I'm VP at Pacific Aerospace now.

1302
01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:10.625
- I heard.

1303
01:18:10.625 --> 01:18:11.709
- Really?

1304
01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:14.667
Because my HR guy has been
trying to get you in for months.

1305
01:18:18.333 --> 01:18:20.250
- I was gonna call him back.

1306
01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:21.875
I'm taking a few months off

1307
01:18:21.875 --> 01:18:23.917
to figure out what I wanna do.

1308
01:18:25.083 --> 01:18:27.333
- You know. Tom still blames you

1309
01:18:27.333 --> 01:18:30.000
for not getting the board's
approval on the A7 money.

1310
01:18:30.959 --> 01:18:33.125
- I hope that's not why you got fired.

1311
01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:37.000
- No. I just realized that
if you didn't have a penis.

1312
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.875
I wasn't getting promoted any higher.

1313
01:18:39.917 --> 01:18:41.291
- A lot of dick at the top.

1314
01:18:42.959 --> 01:18:44.834
- So what do I have to do

1315
01:18:44.834 --> 01:18:46.709
to get you to come work with me?

1316
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:49.458
We have better pay. better benefits.

1317
01:18:50.917 --> 01:18:52.959
- How do you see me fitting in?

1318
01:18:54.083 --> 01:18:58.250
- Before. we were always
chasing number one

1319
01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:01.291
but at Pacific. we are number one

1320
01:19:01.291 --> 01:19:02.875
and I need you to keep us there.

1321
01:19:05.583 --> 01:19:09.041
- I always thought I wanted
to be in the space program

1322
01:19:09.041 --> 01:19:09.875
and I did it.

1323
01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:13.917
But I think I want to
do something else now.

1324
01:19:13.917 --> 01:19:16.834
- I'll double what you were making.

1325
01:19:16.834 --> 01:19:17.667
- Yes.

1326
01:19:19.542 --> 01:19:20.959
- It's not about the money.

1327
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:23.750
I need to find something else.

1328
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.625
- At least think about it.

1329
01:19:26.625 --> 01:19:30.208
You know more about the space
program than anyone I know.

1330
01:19:30.208 --> 01:19:32.291
The world needs your talents.

1331
01:19:32.291 --> 01:19:33.500
Don't just walk away.

1332
01:19:41.083 --> 01:19:42.208
- I'll think about it.

1333
01:19:43.542 --> 01:19:44.500
- Is that a maybe?

1334
01:19:47.792 --> 01:19:48.625
Is that a maybe?

1335
01:19:50.166 --> 01:19:51.667
- It's a yes.

1336
01:19:51.667 --> 01:19:53.250
- It's a no.

1337
01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:55.083
I spent the last week
thinking through my options

1338
01:19:55.083 --> 01:19:56.458
and I need to make a change.

1339
01:19:57.250 --> 01:20:00.208
Come on Jason. give us a try
just tell me what you want

1340
01:20:00.792 --> 01:20:01.834
I wanna be happy.

1341
01:20:02.458 --> 01:20:05.041
Well. I can’t help you with that.

1342
01:20:05.041 --> 01:20:08.500
I respect your decision and if
you change you mind. let me know.

1343
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:10.417
I’m sorry it didn’t work out.

1344
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:13.583
I know.

1345
01:20:14.542 --> 01:20:16.333
I'm sure our paths will cross again.

1346
01:20:16.875 --> 01:20:17.792
I hope so.

1347
01:20:19.583 --> 01:20:20.959
Take care Jason.

1348
01:20:21.625 --> 01:20:22.458
Thanks. Diana.

1349
01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:26.083
(somber music)

1350
01:21:10.834 --> 01:21:11.834
- Mr. Jason.

1351
01:21:14.542 --> 01:21:15.417
I have a question.

1352
01:21:17.709 --> 01:21:20.000
- I'm sorry. class is over.

1353
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:20.834
- Oh.

1354
01:21:22.083 --> 01:21:24.834
- But I can stay if you
need some private tutoring.

1355
01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:27.542
- Well I have a question

1356
01:21:27.542 --> 01:21:29.542
about why you became a teacher.

1357
01:21:31.834 --> 01:21:33.208
- Okay.

1358
01:21:33.208 --> 01:21:34.875
- So I looked you up online

1359
01:21:35.792 --> 01:21:37.583
and I thought it was kinda strange

1360
01:21:37.583 --> 01:21:40.542
that you would go from a high paying job

1361
01:21:40.542 --> 01:21:43.750
to a book deal that
made you even more money

1362
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:44.583
to a teacher?

1363
01:21:45.458 --> 01:21:48.333
We all know that teachers
don't get paid very much.

1364
01:21:48.333 --> 01:21:50.625
- Well. I will give you an A for research.

1365
01:21:54.917 --> 01:21:57.959
I saved what I earned as a flight director

1366
01:21:57.959 --> 01:22:02.834
and after a very successful
book deal. thank you. I retired.

1367
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.875
- Doesn't look like you retired to me.

1368
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:08.834
- This?

1369
01:22:10.417 --> 01:22:11.291
This is fun.

1370
01:22:12.417 --> 01:22:15.834
I get to get students like you excited

1371
01:22:15.834 --> 01:22:17.375
about science and space

1372
01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:20.458
and I'm working on book two.

1373
01:22:20.458 --> 01:22:23.083
- Well. I'm a big fan of the first book.

1374
01:22:24.458 --> 01:22:26.583
Where does Captain
Beansprout go this time?

1375
01:22:28.041 --> 01:22:29.750
- I don't wanna give it away.

1376
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:30.709
- No.

1377
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:33.000
- But where no sprout has gone before.

1378
01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:36.875
- I do have one complaint.

1379
01:22:38.291 --> 01:22:39.125
- What?

1380
01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:43.834
- Well. it just seems
that Captain Beansprout

1381
01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:47.000
must be lonely. up in space all alone.

1382
01:22:49.333 --> 01:22:51.083
Was there ever a co-captain Bean

1383
01:22:52.208 --> 01:22:55.291
or a squash or a carrot?

1384
01:22:56.792 --> 01:22:59.291
- Well. there was a co-captain Bean

1385
01:23:00.125 --> 01:23:01.333
but it didn't work out.

1386
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:04.542
- Why not?

1387
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:09.542
- The captain didn't know what he wanted

1388
01:23:09.542 --> 01:23:10.750
until it was too late.

1389
01:23:12.333 --> 01:23:14.583
She ran off with some tomato.

1390
01:23:16.875 --> 01:23:17.709
- Not a tomato.

1391
01:23:23.458 --> 01:23:25.500
I would love to hear more about the book.

1392
01:23:26.875 --> 01:23:28.375
Is there anyway that I can schedule

1393
01:23:28.375 --> 01:23:29.500
some out of class time?

1394
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:34.291
- So how'd things go with Mitch?

1395
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:39.208
- We dated for a few months

1396
01:23:39.208 --> 01:23:41.834
and then when he asked
me to move in with him.

1397
01:23:41.834 --> 01:23:42.667
I panicked.

1398
01:23:44.166 --> 01:23:45.000
Yeah.

1399
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.041
- Sort of like saying
I love you too early.

1400
01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:49.208
- Right. yeah.

1401
01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:50.500
Everything's about timing.

1402
01:23:53.709 --> 01:23:56.333
- I'm sorry I threw up on
you at the Christmas party.

1403
01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:59.250
- What?

1404
01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:01.542
What made you think of that?

1405
01:24:01.542 --> 01:24:04.959
(reflective piano music)

1406
01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.917
- When I met your sister.

1407
01:24:08.917 --> 01:24:11.208
she took great pleasure in reminding me.

1408
01:24:12.875 --> 01:24:14.542
- Yeah. she's got an evil streak.

1409
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:16.583
She does.

1410
01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.417
- It's really good to see you. though.

1411
01:24:21.625 --> 01:24:22.458
- You. too.

1412
01:24:24.333 --> 01:24:25.166
