3
00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:49.067
Yes?

4
00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:50.502
Hi. Hailey.

5
00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:52.137
Ben.

6
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.339
You remembered.

7
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:57.075
To be honest. I didn't
think you would.

8
00:07:57.077 --> 00:07:58.510
I'd say welcome back

9
00:07:58.512 --> 00:08:01.146
but that would imply that I
give a shit about this place.

10
00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:06.918
It's good to see
you. you look good.

11
00:08:08.489 --> 00:08:09.287
So do you.

12
00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:10.155
Oh.

13
00:08:12.793 --> 00:08:14.059
Sorry about your dad.

14
00:08:15.262 --> 00:08:17.329
What are you doing here?

15
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.297
I thought I saw you earlier.

16
00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:20.932
Couldn't believe it.

17
00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:22.601
I had to come see for myself.

18
00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:24.603
I wasn't sure if
it was really you.

19
00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:31.376
Do you wanna let me in? We
can catch up like old friends.

20
00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:38.750
It's quite a collection.

21
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.689
Yeah.

22
00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:56.735
You never really
liked me. did you?

23
00:08:58.372 --> 00:08:59.237
What?

24
00:09:00.507 --> 00:09:01.573
Come on.

25
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:04.843
Think I didn't notice
the look on your face?

26
00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:07.746
I wasn't
expecting a drop-in.

27
00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:11.416
No. that's not it.

28
00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:15.387
It's okay. you can tell me.

29
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.625
You were mean.

30
00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:22.627
What?

31
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.665
You were mean to me.

32
00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:28.099
You pushed me. teased me.

33
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:32.904
I don't quite
remember it that way.

34
00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.773
You threw rocks at me

35
00:09:34.775 --> 00:09:36.608
when we go swimming in the lake.

36
00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:40.078
Shit.

37
00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:43.415
I forgot about that.

38
00:09:48.188 --> 00:09:49.020
Ouch.

39
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.825
Did that hurt?

40
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.596
Yeah.

41
00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:03.468
I'm sorry.

42
00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:05.170
I'll live.

43
00:10:10.544 --> 00:10:11.710
What about that one?

44
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:13.912
No.

45
00:10:13.914 --> 00:10:15.547
No. that one wasn't you.

46
00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:16.615
Oh.

47
00:10:23.757 --> 00:10:24.723
I was bored. okay?

48
00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:26.691
A lot.

49
00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:29.761
Growing up. there
wasn't much to do

50
00:10:29.763 --> 00:10:31.730
when you live in the
middle of nowhere.

51
00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:35.600
Gotta entertain
yourself somehow.

52
00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:36.401
Yeah.

53
00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:39.804
I just didn't wanna see people.

54
00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:42.140
What do you mean?

55
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.745
I didn't want
anyone. you know.

56
00:10:46.747 --> 00:10:48.780
hugging me or crying on me

57
00:10:48.782 --> 00:10:51.016
or telling me their
deepest condolences.

58
00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:52.417
It's just better that way.

59
00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:56.721
Yeah. you mean easier?

60
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.692
Yeah.

61
00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:04.129
I guess.

62
00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:05.764
I guess it doesn't
matter anyway.

63
00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:06.564
I'm not staying.

64
00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:09.034
No?

65
00:11:09.936 --> 00:11:11.503
No.

66
00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:13.438
It's a long way
to come for nothing.

67
00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:15.607
He's my father.

68
00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:16.741
Yeah. was.

69
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.680
To our fathers.

70
00:11:28.789 --> 00:11:32.290
How do you drink that stuff?

71
00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:33.758
It was his favorite.

72
00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:36.194
He kept it hidden
in his dresser.

73
00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:38.296
You get used to the taste.

74
00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:39.898
That's not a very
good hiding spot.

75
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.300
My dad used to hide
his in an old toolbox.

76
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:44.636
He wasn't hiding it.

77
00:11:44.638 --> 00:11:45.737
I knew exactly where it was.

78
00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:49.908
Why'd he hide it. then?

79
00:11:53.513 --> 00:11:54.913
He trusted me.

80
00:11:57.517 --> 00:11:58.416
Do you miss him?

81
00:12:03.824 --> 00:12:04.656
Of course.

82
00:12:05.692 --> 00:12:07.759
If your dad died.
wouldn't you miss him?

83
00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:13.098
Ah. fortunately my
dad is alive and well.

84
00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:15.333
Right.

85
00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:18.002
That's a good
thing. that's good.

86
00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:21.106
We are having a dinner tonight

87
00:12:21.108 --> 00:12:22.874
for Tressa's birthday.

88
00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:26.077
Yeah. we still celebrate
it every year. you know.

89
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:29.948
Dinner. cake. the usual.

90
00:12:31.017 --> 00:12:32.350
Yeah. I remember.

91
00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:34.152
We'd like it if
you could join us.

92
00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:40.258
I just got in. so I...

93
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.294
Yeah well it would be
just like you remember.

94
00:12:44.397 --> 00:12:46.765
You remember. it'd be you. me.

95
00:12:46.767 --> 00:12:47.999
my dad. your dad.

96
00:12:48.902 --> 00:12:49.834
He never missed it.

97
00:12:51.872 --> 00:12:53.972
I can't imagine he would.

98
00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:55.039
Yeah. not one year.

99
00:12:56.409 --> 00:12:57.809
You know. even after you left.

100
00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.378
He'd even pick up the cake.

101
00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:02.881
Sounds like him.

102
00:13:03.717 --> 00:13:04.816
Yeah.

103
00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.820
And it would mean a lot
to my dad. you know.

104
00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:10.822
He'd like to keep
the tradition going.

105
00:13:10.824 --> 00:13:13.725
And since your dad.
he can't make it.

106
00:13:13.727 --> 00:13:15.560
it would mean a
lot if you would.

107
00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:19.764
Specially since you're back.

108
00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:20.799
however long that is.

109
00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:25.837
He's probably cooking
up the fish as we speak.

110
00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:29.340
Yeah.

111
00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:31.342
Yeah. it's okay.

112
00:13:31.344 --> 00:13:33.411
I don't really like fish either.

113
00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:35.213
But all you gotta do is smile.

114
00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:38.082
pretend like you're
having a good time.

115
00:13:42.088 --> 00:13:43.388
Can you do that. Hailey?

116
00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.189
Smells good.

117
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:26.090
Yeah.

118
00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.725
Dad doesn't cook much anymore

119
00:15:27.727 --> 00:15:29.861
but he hasn't lost his touch.

120
00:15:35.702 --> 00:15:36.601
That one's mine.

121
00:15:38.972 --> 00:15:42.006
I won it at the
Summer Catch of '97.

122
00:15:42.876 --> 00:15:46.110
I was the only kid under
18 that won a prize.

123
00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:48.046
Yeah.

124
00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:50.949
It was a good summer.

125
00:15:51.918 --> 00:15:53.084
I've never been.

126
00:15:53.086 --> 00:15:54.018
To the Summer Catch?

127
00:15:55.322 --> 00:15:56.788
No. fishing.

128
00:15:57.991 --> 00:15:59.123
Oh.

129
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.661
Yeah. we did it all the time.

130
00:16:03.663 --> 00:16:04.595
If you didn't catch it.

131
00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:05.797
You don't eat it.

132
00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.133
It's an old family motto.

133
00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:11.803
I haven't used it since.

134
00:16:13.506 --> 00:16:15.540
well. not for a while now.

135
00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:20.345
It's good to see you again.

136
00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:21.646
It's been a long time.

137
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:24.983
My deepest condolences.

138
00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:29.187
As you know. your dad
and I were very close.

139
00:16:38.765 --> 00:16:40.198
Glad you could join us.

140
00:16:41.801 --> 00:16:42.467
Tonight is very special.

141
00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:47.105
Thanks for inviting me.

142
00:16:48.942 --> 00:16:50.174
You didn't have to do that.

143
00:16:51.644 --> 00:16:53.978
What kind of neighbors
would we be if we didn't?

144
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.014
Besides. you used to
be a regular here.

145
00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.017
I'm sure we'll have
lots to talk about.

146
00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:03.488
Well. that dinner's not
gonna finish itself.

147
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:04.822
Can I help with dinner?

148
00:17:04.824 --> 00:17:07.225
No. thank you. but
I've got it covered.

149
00:17:07.227 --> 00:17:08.693
Benny'll keep you company.

150
00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:11.029
Take her jacket for her too.

151
00:17:12.165 --> 00:17:13.564
You want me to roll
out a red carpet for her

152
00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:14.432
while I'm at it?

153
00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:20.705
Forgive him. Hailey.

154
00:17:21.841 --> 00:17:23.241
We don't entertain much.

155
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.510
Ben forgets how to act

156
00:17:25.512 --> 00:17:26.978
when there's company around.

157
00:18:15.695 --> 00:18:16.527
Hailey.

158
00:18:17.397 --> 00:18:19.230
Hailey!

159
00:18:19.232 --> 00:18:20.598
What?

160
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.466
You okay?

161
00:18:22.902 --> 00:18:24.135
Yeah.

162
00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:26.237
Are you sure?

163
00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:27.972
You got the deer in
the headlights look.

164
00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:30.141
Yeah. yeah.

165
00:18:30.143 --> 00:18:32.043
No. I'm good.

166
00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.958
I need a cigarette.

167
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.161
Where's my jacket?

168
00:18:50.163 --> 00:18:51.129
In the closet.

169
00:18:51.998 --> 00:18:52.897
Right.

170
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.346
You hear that?

171
00:19:08.348 --> 00:19:09.847
Yeah.

172
00:19:09.849 --> 00:19:11.816
Good. then do something
about it. will ya?

173
00:19:21.127 --> 00:19:23.194
And don't let her leave.

174
00:19:36.109 --> 00:19:37.175
Hi.

175
00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:39.210
Hi. it's okay.

176
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.546
It's okay.

177
00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:46.350
Hi.

178
00:19:47.787 --> 00:19:48.619
Hi. buddy.

179
00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:52.590
It's okay.

180
00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:57.195
It's okay. come here.

181
00:19:58.731 --> 00:19:59.597
Come on.

182
00:20:05.405 --> 00:20:06.270
Hi.

183
00:20:08.675 --> 00:20:09.540
It's okay.

184
00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:13.277
Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.

185
00:20:14.314 --> 00:20:15.546
Come on.

186
00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:16.647
You like dogs?

187
00:20:19.185 --> 00:20:22.253
Sorry. I couldn't resist.

188
00:20:25.658 --> 00:20:26.490
Don't be.

189
00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:29.627
Looks like he likes you.

190
00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:31.629
He doesn't like anyone.

191
00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:34.265
Even you?

192
00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:41.205
Do you always
keep him in a cage?

193
00:20:41.207 --> 00:20:42.273
Yeah. more or less.

194
00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:45.343
I mean. that's why
he doesn't like you.

195
00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:50.348
Can I bum a drag?

196
00:20:59.859 --> 00:21:01.325
I don't remember
you having a dog.

197
00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:03.461
We didn't.

198
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:06.631
My dad got him a few years back.

199
00:21:06.633 --> 00:21:08.199
thought it'd be a good idea.

200
00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:10.468
For what?

201
00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:12.803
I don't know.

202
00:21:14.407 --> 00:21:15.439
Didn't work anyway.

203
00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:17.041
It just became my problem.

204
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.013
- I had a dog once.
- Hey.

205
00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:25.349
It didn't go very well.

206
00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:27.985
He had two white front paws

207
00:21:27.987 --> 00:21:29.220
and I called him Socks.

208
00:21:29.989 --> 00:21:31.222
- Socks?
- Mhmm.

209
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.327
That's when I was like 11. so.

210
00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:39.864
What happened to him?

211
00:21:41.601 --> 00:21:42.900
I don't know.

212
00:21:45.672 --> 00:21:46.971
Woke up one morning and

213
00:21:51.344 --> 00:21:52.242
he was gone.

214
00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:53.143
Dogs run off.
it's what they do.

215
00:21:54.447 --> 00:21:55.513
Yeah.

216
00:21:58.351 --> 00:22:00.418
Why do you think we
keep him in a cage?

217
00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:09.860
Dinner's ready.

218
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:23.274
Thank you.

219
00:22:23.276 --> 00:22:24.208
Looks good.

220
00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:26.277
It was her favorite.

221
00:22:28.281 --> 00:22:31.349
Not fancy. but it'll
get the job done.

222
00:22:31.351 --> 00:22:33.284
Yeah. he says that every year.

223
00:22:33.286 --> 00:22:34.185
Yeah. probably.

224
00:22:39.692 --> 00:22:41.192
You know. nothing
brings me more joy

225
00:22:41.194 --> 00:22:43.527
than to see you sitting
here tonight. Hailey.

226
00:22:44.564 --> 00:22:45.763
Just as it used to be.

227
00:22:47.734 --> 00:22:49.266
So what have you been up to?

228
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.436
How are you handling it
without your old man?

229
00:22:55.308 --> 00:22:56.407
Okay. I guess.

230
00:23:00.513 --> 00:23:02.480
I keep thinking that I'll
see him standing there

231
00:23:02.482 --> 00:23:03.981
every time I walk into a room.

232
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.469
That's natural.

233
00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:11.421
Unfortunately. it
never really goes away.

234
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.033
Tressa really liked
you. you know?

235
00:23:23.035 --> 00:23:25.202
She used to braid my hair

236
00:23:25.204 --> 00:23:26.904
and taught me how to do it.

237
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:30.007
She was really nice to me.

238
00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:31.709
Yeah. she was
nice to everyone.

239
00:23:31.711 --> 00:23:32.576
Still.

240
00:23:39.452 --> 00:23:42.620
I guess you're probably
pretty happy to be home?

241
00:23:42.622 --> 00:23:44.121
How many years has it been?

242
00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:48.025
I don't know.
maybe seven or eight?

243
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:49.693
Hmm.

244
00:23:53.733 --> 00:23:54.598
What?

245
00:23:55.535 --> 00:23:56.634
Nothing. it's just.

246
00:23:58.237 --> 00:23:59.303
where does time go?

247
00:24:11.584 --> 00:24:15.219
My star will find her way home.

248
00:24:15.955 --> 00:24:16.821
What?

249
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.660
Something your
dad used to say.

250
00:24:24.497 --> 00:24:26.397
That's what he
called you. isn't it?

251
00:24:28.568 --> 00:24:29.400
Yeah.

252
00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.170
I didn't
believe him. but he knew.

253
00:24:33.172 --> 00:24:34.038
He always knew.

254
00:24:38.845 --> 00:24:40.478
I'm sure you made
him very happy.

255
00:24:42.949 --> 00:24:44.882
You look a lot like
him too. you know.

256
00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:48.586
Same misshapen knuckles
and everything.

257
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:54.325
Then again. I've
actually never seen

258
00:24:54.327 --> 00:24:55.526
photos of your mother.

259
00:24:57.497 --> 00:24:58.395
Neither have I.

260
00:25:08.541 --> 00:25:09.673
Eat something.

261
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.709
Before it gets cold.

262
00:25:19.652 --> 00:25:20.784
So what have you been up to?

263
00:25:20.786 --> 00:25:22.553
You must have a lot
of stories to share.

264
00:25:22.555 --> 00:25:23.687
No. not really.

265
00:25:25.525 --> 00:25:26.790
It's boring.

266
00:25:27.793 --> 00:25:29.426
I own an apartment.

267
00:25:31.297 --> 00:25:35.799
It's small and it's
nice but it's mine.

268
00:25:35.801 --> 00:25:37.468
And I found a job
that people are nice.

269
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:38.969
Oh. that's good.

270
00:25:38.971 --> 00:25:39.803
Yeah.

271
00:25:42.475 --> 00:25:44.108
You have a lot of trophies.

272
00:25:47.513 --> 00:25:48.612
Fishing's in our blood.

273
00:25:50.516 --> 00:25:51.715
Most of them are Tressa's.

274
00:25:52.552 --> 00:25:53.751
I have a few.

275
00:25:54.987 --> 00:25:55.819
Ben has one.

276
00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:56.654
Four.

277
00:26:00.326 --> 00:26:02.326
Me and your dad. we
fished quite a bit.

278
00:26:05.364 --> 00:26:06.564
He was a very patient man.

279
00:26:09.168 --> 00:26:10.067
Very patient.

280
00:26:13.372 --> 00:26:15.439
Never leaving until
he caught something.

281
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:18.943
Just staring at the line.

282
00:26:22.014 --> 00:26:23.614
Never taking his eyes off it.

283
00:26:32.692 --> 00:26:33.791
I didn't know that.

284
00:26:35.061 --> 00:26:36.327
You didn't know what.

285
00:26:37.697 --> 00:26:39.496
that your dad was patient
or that he fished?

286
00:26:41.634 --> 00:26:42.700
Either.

287
00:26:42.702 --> 00:26:44.034
We didn't really
keep in touch. so.

288
00:26:46.539 --> 00:26:49.607
We spent almost every
weekend out there.

289
00:26:49.609 --> 00:26:52.576
We'd catch 'em and
Benny would gut 'em.

290
00:26:52.578 --> 00:26:53.644
Yeah.

291
00:26:53.646 --> 00:26:54.845
I got pretty good too.

292
00:26:56.215 --> 00:26:58.315
Ben looks at
gutting as an artform.

293
00:26:59.919 --> 00:27:04.188
But it's fishing itself.
that's the real art.

294
00:27:06.425 --> 00:27:08.726
Any fisherman worth his
salt will tell you that.

295
00:27:10.596 --> 00:27:11.629
Tressa was very good.

296
00:27:13.666 --> 00:27:14.898
Oh Lord. was she ever.

297
00:27:16.602 --> 00:27:17.901
Just like her grandfather.

298
00:27:23.442 --> 00:27:24.775
We'd spend hours out
there. just me and her.

299
00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:31.749
Even on the days that we'd
come back with nothing were

300
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.220
still some of the
best days I've had.

301
00:27:41.027 --> 00:27:42.860
Sounds like you
were really close.

302
00:28:12.792 --> 00:28:13.757
Not today.

303
00:28:22.201 --> 00:28:23.067
Ben.

304
00:28:28.407 --> 00:28:29.406
Don't worry.

305
00:28:29.408 --> 00:28:30.641
Wouldn't wanna ruin it.

306
00:28:32.712 --> 00:28:34.745
- So how long are you-
- I have a question.

307
00:28:35.815 --> 00:28:37.915
What was it like growing
up in that house?

308
00:28:39.719 --> 00:28:40.651
What?

309
00:28:40.653 --> 00:28:41.885
Your house.

310
00:28:43.489 --> 00:28:44.354
I'm just curious.

311
00:28:44.356 --> 00:28:45.222
Ben!

312
00:28:46.092 --> 00:28:46.957
What?

313
00:28:48.427 --> 00:28:49.760
You're being impolite.

314
00:28:51.063 --> 00:28:52.730
No. I'm just
talking to Hailey.

315
00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:56.400
Why would you ask me that?

316
00:28:56.402 --> 00:28:57.901
I'm just making conversation.

317
00:28:58.738 --> 00:29:00.471
Why don't you get some air?

318
00:29:02.775 --> 00:29:04.074
It's freezing out.

319
00:29:04.777 --> 00:29:05.843
It'll do you good.

320
00:29:20.526 --> 00:29:22.126
Ben's a little
touchy these days.

321
00:29:23.095 --> 00:29:24.762
Specially on Tressa's birthday.

322
00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:32.970
You don't like carrots?

323
00:29:36.542 --> 00:29:37.841
I'm just not quite hungry.

324
00:29:39.612 --> 00:29:42.780
It's probably
not what you were expecting.

325
00:29:42.782 --> 00:29:44.815
I wasn't expecting anything.

326
00:29:44.817 --> 00:29:45.916
Mmm.

327
00:29:45.918 --> 00:29:47.284
Somehow I doubt that.

328
00:29:54.894 --> 00:29:56.460
Could I use your restroom?

329
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:58.729
Sure.

330
00:29:59.932 --> 00:30:01.598
I'll check on Ben.

331
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.700
make sure he hasn't
wandered off too far.

332
00:30:05.337 --> 00:30:06.737
Does he do that?

333
00:30:06.739 --> 00:30:07.838
He likes the woods.

334
00:30:09.608 --> 00:30:12.042
It's still down the
hall on the right.

335
00:31:41.734 --> 00:31:42.966
What are you doing in here?

336
00:31:45.838 --> 00:31:48.138
I was looking
for the restroom.

337
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:51.108
It's not in here.

338
00:31:55.114 --> 00:31:56.914
I don't like people
in here. Hailey.

339
00:32:00.019 --> 00:32:01.385
Did you touch anything?

340
00:32:01.387 --> 00:32:02.486
Of course not. I...

341
00:32:12.464 --> 00:32:15.532
She was really pretty.

342
00:32:15.534 --> 00:32:17.000
Yeah. she was.

343
00:32:18.537 --> 00:32:20.270
Let me show you to the restroom.

344
00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:23.373
Okay.

345
00:33:05.084 --> 00:33:06.483
There you go.

346
00:33:07.653 --> 00:33:08.518
Thanks.

347
00:34:07.746 --> 00:34:10.814
Where are you going?

348
00:34:10.816 --> 00:34:12.382
I was just gonna
go check on Ben.

349
00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:14.084
Well that's
very nice of you.

350
00:34:14.086 --> 00:34:15.819
- Yeah. I'll just be a second.
- Hold on.

351
00:34:17.156 --> 00:34:18.255
There's no need.

352
00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:20.057
He's fine.

353
00:34:20.993 --> 00:34:22.059
Just needs to cool off.

354
00:34:23.529 --> 00:34:24.327
Right.

355
00:34:26.432 --> 00:34:28.165
We still have chocolate cake.

356
00:34:29.168 --> 00:34:31.168
You like chocolate
cake. don't you?

357
00:34:32.771 --> 00:34:33.570
Yeah.

358
00:34:34.673 --> 00:34:36.139
Well. speak of the devil.

359
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.779
Hey. I'm sorry about earlier.

360
00:34:42.781 --> 00:34:44.347
I got a little carried away.

361
00:34:45.284 --> 00:34:46.283
All is forgiven.

362
00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:48.251
Right. Hailey?

363
00:34:50.189 --> 00:34:51.288
Right.

364
00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:56.259
Benny. escort Hailey
back to the table.

365
00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.763
We'd hate for her
to get lost again.

366
00:35:07.306 --> 00:35:08.371
After you.

00:36:56.982 --> 00:36:58.415
Get Hailey another bottle.

374
00:36:59.351 --> 00:37:01.184
This one's looking
a little worn out.

375
00:37:01.186 --> 00:37:02.085
I'm actually good.

376
00:37:02.087 --> 00:37:03.520
- thanks.
- Nonsense.

377
00:37:03.522 --> 00:37:07.157
Besides. you're gonna want
a cold one for the toast.

378
00:37:48.267 --> 00:37:50.600
It's been a few years
since you've been back.

379
00:37:51.637 --> 00:37:53.303
Your father must be honored

380
00:37:53.305 --> 00:37:56.106
that you're carrying
on this tradition.

381
00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:02.528
Tradition?

382
00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:03.613
Celebrating her
memory. of course.

383
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.985
After all. it was his idea.

384
00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:17.994
There's not a day that goes by

385
00:38:17.996 --> 00:38:19.462
when I don't think of you.

386
00:38:22.901 --> 00:38:24.534
There's not a moment that passes

387
00:38:27.239 --> 00:38:28.805
where I don't wonder
what kind of a person

388
00:38:28.807 --> 00:38:30.006
you would have become.

389
00:38:32.311 --> 00:38:35.879
What kind of life
you would have had.

390
00:38:40.485 --> 00:38:41.751
You were my everything.

391
00:38:47.459 --> 00:38:48.358
My whole world.

392
00:39:26.198 --> 00:39:27.430
You believe in God. Hailey?

393
00:39:34.039 --> 00:39:35.772
I bought a hammer
a few weeks back

394
00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:39.242
from that hardware store.

395
00:39:39.244 --> 00:39:41.745
The one that sells ties
in a box for a dollar.

396
00:39:43.915 --> 00:39:46.316
I wasn't in there for
any particular reason.

397
00:39:46.318 --> 00:39:47.484
I just wanted to look.

398
00:39:50.322 --> 00:39:52.322
I found myself in aisle three.

399
00:39:53.058 --> 00:39:54.124
staring at this one.

400
00:39:57.195 --> 00:39:58.061
A claw hammer.

401
00:40:00.432 --> 00:40:01.765
I don't know why I chose it.

402
00:40:02.834 --> 00:40:04.501
There were several
hammers to choose from.

403
00:40:06.071 --> 00:40:07.504
Call me crazy. but.

404
00:40:10.108 --> 00:40:12.075
I felt like it was
staring back at me.

405
00:40:16.248 --> 00:40:17.814
I started to fantasize

406
00:40:19.851 --> 00:40:21.918
about all the things
I could do with it.

407
00:40:25.457 --> 00:40:26.656
It was light. durable.

408
00:40:30.228 --> 00:40:30.894
Solid.

409
00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:34.931
Perfect.

410
00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.908
You know. losing a child is like

411
00:40:48.747 --> 00:40:49.762
losing a limb.

412
00:40:49.764 --> 00:40:50.780
You never quite
function the same again.

413
00:40:55.587 --> 00:40:58.822
And when a father
stops believing in God.

414
00:41:01.226 --> 00:41:03.026
there's no telling
what he might do.

415
00:41:07.098 --> 00:41:08.064
What's happening?

416
00:41:11.403 --> 00:41:12.502
What's happening?

417
00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.705
What?

418
00:41:17.576 --> 00:41:18.408
What did?

419
00:41:22.747 --> 00:41:26.149
What did you do?

420
00:41:27.252 --> 00:41:28.084
Ketamine.

421
00:41:29.187 --> 00:41:31.187
A powerful tranquilizer.

422
00:41:31.189 --> 00:41:33.189
They say it's used
to take down horses.

423
00:41:34.626 --> 00:41:36.459
I don't know how
much he gave you.

424
00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:39.395
Ben isn't exactly a chemist
when it comes to measurements.

425
00:41:42.133 --> 00:41:44.033
It's probably not
a pleasant feeling.

426
00:41:46.137 --> 00:41:49.539
Right now. you're losing
all motor function ability.

427
00:41:51.042 --> 00:41:52.575
Your heart rate is increasing

428
00:41:53.678 --> 00:41:54.711
which is only making
the experience

429
00:41:54.713 --> 00:41:55.912
all that much worse.

430
00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:59.549
No sense fighting it.

431
00:42:20.071 --> 00:42:21.538
Thanks for coming. Hailey.

432
00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:26.376
I'm sure Tressa appreciates it.

433
00:42:59.544 --> 00:43:00.710
Hey. you know where to go?

434
00:43:00.712 --> 00:43:01.945
Yeah. I know a place.

435
00:43:01.947 --> 00:43:04.113
Make sure it's
far enough away.

436
00:43:04.115 --> 00:43:07.183
Don't be messing around
out there. you hear me?

437
00:43:07.185 --> 00:43:08.518
Hey. you hear me?!

438
00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.452
Jesus!

439
00:43:09.454 --> 00:43:10.587
I hear you!

440
00:43:13.725 --> 00:43:15.224
What about her car?

441
00:43:15.226 --> 00:43:18.027
We'll take care
of that when you get back.

442
00:43:18.029 --> 00:43:19.462
Be back in an hour.

443
00:43:19.464 --> 00:43:20.563
Mhmm.

444
00:43:20.565 --> 00:43:22.465
I'm saving those
dishes for you too.

445
00:44:04.843 --> 00:44:07.677
You sing songs?

446
00:44:10.115 --> 00:44:12.815
Oh. Tressa and I. we'd always
sing in the car together

447
00:44:12.817 --> 00:44:14.851
on family road trips.

448
00:44:18.823 --> 00:44:21.924
We'd do it real loud
to piss off our dad.

449
00:44:26.965 --> 00:44:30.533
I bet you're real
pissed at me right now.

450
00:44:31.469 --> 00:44:32.402
I don't blame you.

451
00:44:38.677 --> 00:44:40.743
I just want you to know.

452
00:44:42.681 --> 00:44:44.013
it wasn't my idea. okay?

453
00:44:47.485 --> 00:44:49.118
I like you. Hailey.

454
00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:51.721
I really do.

455
00:44:56.728 --> 00:45:00.430
I'm sure we would have
been great friends.

456
00:45:01.733 --> 00:45:03.533
But it's a family thing.

457
00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.040
You know I never
liked my sister?

458
00:45:13.978 --> 00:45:15.278
Yeah I loved her and everything.

459
00:45:18.883 --> 00:45:20.717
She was always dad's favorite.

460
00:45:24.055 --> 00:45:24.921
Even now.

461
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:33.229
I know he wishes it was me.

462
00:45:37.869 --> 00:45:39.936
Hey. I like this song.

463
00:46:55.113 --> 00:46:56.813
Thank you. Hailey.

464
00:47:01.286 --> 00:47:04.487
It feels good to have
someone to talk to.

465
00:49:10.748 --> 00:49:11.614
Hailey!

466
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.486
Hailey!

467
00:49:53.291 --> 00:49:54.156
Hailey!

468
00:49:56.794 --> 00:49:57.660
Hailey!

469
00:50:00.164 --> 00:50:04.100
Hailey!

470
00:50:04.102 --> 00:50:05.201
Hailey!

471
00:52:13.131 --> 00:52:14.330
Okay. okay.

472
00:53:24.068 --> 00:53:25.434
Socks never ran away.

473
00:53:28.172 --> 00:53:31.373
My dad. he woke me
up that morning.

474
00:53:34.145 --> 00:53:37.146
He told me to go
to the backyard.

475
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:41.951
He had Socks tied to the post.

476
00:53:43.721 --> 00:53:46.255
He told me we couldn't keep him

477
00:53:47.191 --> 00:53:49.458
and I had broken the rule.

478
00:53:51.162 --> 00:53:54.063
Said that I need to be punished.

479
00:53:56.867 --> 00:54:01.804
He put the knife in my hand.

480
00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:04.073
He told me he does it

481
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:07.343
or I do.

482
00:54:10.381 --> 00:54:13.015
And it's the only way I'd learn.

483
00:54:16.587 --> 00:54:18.087
I made it quick.

484
00:54:20.424 --> 00:54:22.024
He wouldn't have.

485
00:54:27.398 --> 00:54:28.297
It was quick.

486
00:55:26.123 --> 00:55:27.423
Hello. my girl.

487
00:55:35.466 --> 00:55:36.665
I know you're hungry.

488
00:55:47.945 --> 00:55:50.245
Are you gonna be a good
girl for me tonight?

489
00:55:54.719 --> 00:55:57.853
If you don't. you'll be
in here for another week.

490
00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:01.590
Daddy doesn't wanna
put you in here

491
00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:04.426
but you leave him no choice.

492
00:56:08.466 --> 00:56:09.431
You want your sandwich?

493
00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:16.905
Good girl.

494
00:56:19.643 --> 00:56:20.476
Go ahead.

495
00:56:22.713 --> 00:56:23.579
Hey.

496
00:56:32.189 --> 00:56:33.455
Who's my star?

497
00:57:45.296 --> 00:57:46.929
Thanks.

498
00:57:46.931 --> 00:57:48.797
I appreciate this.

499
00:57:48.799 --> 00:57:50.566
My truck won't even
make it two miles

500
00:57:50.568 --> 00:57:51.467
without breaking down.

501
00:57:51.469 --> 00:57:52.568
Yeah. don't worry about it.

502
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:54.169
I'm heading into town anyway.

503
00:57:55.072 --> 00:57:56.472
Is Ben coming?

504
00:57:56.474 --> 00:57:58.674
No. he's off somewhere
doing god knows what.

505
00:57:59.477 --> 00:58:00.809
Let's get going.

506
00:58:00.811 --> 00:58:03.412
I wanna make it to the
shop before it closes.

507
00:58:03.414 --> 00:58:05.414
And Murray always
shuts down early

508
00:58:05.416 --> 00:58:07.850
to knock back a few and
thinks no one notices.

509
00:58:14.625 --> 00:58:15.991
I mean he's sitting
in a bar on a Tuesday

510
00:58:15.993 --> 00:58:17.593
when he's supposed to
be running the shop.

511
00:58:17.595 --> 00:58:19.661
What does he think.
no one sees him?

512
00:58:20.764 --> 00:58:23.365
Murray's not the
sharpest tool in the shed.

513
00:58:23.367 --> 00:58:24.800
And then when you do
get him in the garage

514
00:58:24.802 --> 00:58:26.368
he does nothing but
bitch and complain

515
00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:27.536
about his workload
as you're trying

516
00:58:27.538 --> 00:58:29.538
to fill out your paperwork.

517
00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:30.772
Asshole.

518
00:58:30.774 --> 00:58:32.541
There's other
mechanics. you know?

519
00:58:32.543 --> 00:58:33.342
Who?

520
00:58:33.344 --> 00:58:34.710
Joe's dumb ass son?

521
00:58:35.446 --> 00:58:36.211
Or Marty?

522
00:58:36.213 --> 00:58:37.446
That shithead.

523
00:58:37.448 --> 00:58:39.448
Always charges me
extra for special parts

524
00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:41.517
he needs to bring in from China.

525
00:58:41.519 --> 00:58:43.018
Yeah. no thanks.

526
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:45.120
Why don't I take a look at it?

527
00:58:45.122 --> 00:58:47.356
No. I couldn't
ask you to do that.

528
00:58:47.358 --> 00:58:48.657
Why. you got a
problem with me now?

529
00:58:48.659 --> 00:58:50.225
No. of course not.

530
00:58:51.896 --> 00:58:53.562
I do however. have a problem

531
00:58:53.564 --> 00:58:55.697
with that cancer stick
you're sucking on.

532
00:58:57.368 --> 00:58:58.867
You know the rules.

533
00:58:58.869 --> 00:59:01.069
My truck. my rules.

534
00:59:01.071 --> 00:59:02.471
Ben had better
arguments than that

535
00:59:02.473 --> 00:59:03.472
when he was six.

536
00:59:05.576 --> 00:59:06.608
He's a smart kid.

537
00:59:07.645 --> 00:59:10.045
I see a lot of myself in him.

538
00:59:10.047 --> 00:59:11.280
Don't start. Adams.

539
00:59:14.318 --> 00:59:15.717
You need anything?

540
00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:17.319
No. I'm good.

541
00:59:17.321 --> 00:59:18.086
Okay.

542
00:59:18.088 --> 00:59:19.288
Just be a sec.

543
00:59:25.663 --> 00:59:27.629
Son of a bitch.

544
00:59:33.871 --> 00:59:34.736
Ow!

545
01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:01.797
Hey. I picked up some dill.

546
01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:05.734
We fry up those
fish. a little lemon.

547
01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:06.635
put some dill on.

548
01:00:08.572 --> 01:00:08.971
Got everything you needed?

549
01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:15.911
Still upset Murray
talked your ear off?

550
01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:16.845
You know Murray.

551
01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:19.548
Yeah. well.

552
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:21.817
One of these days. he's
gonna be dead Murray.

553
01:00:24.588 --> 01:00:25.454
You all right?

554
01:00:26.624 --> 01:00:27.723
I'm fine.

555
01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:30.425
You look a little bit sick.

556
01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:31.293
I'm fine.

557
01:00:34.932 --> 01:00:35.797
If you say so.

558
01:00:57.755 --> 01:00:58.820
Hey!

559
01:00:59.923 --> 01:01:01.056
Don't forget your part.

560
01:01:17.274 --> 01:01:18.640
You sure you don't
need any help?

561
01:01:18.642 --> 01:01:19.508
No.

562
01:01:20.778 --> 01:01:21.643
All right.

563
01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:22.744
Take it easy.

564
01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:43.131
No. no!

565
01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:43.745
Everything's
okay now. darling.

566
01:04:45.983 --> 01:04:46.915
I promised you.

567
01:04:50.988 --> 01:04:53.054
I always kept my
promises. didn't I?

568
01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:58.994
Everything's gonna be okay.

569
01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:12.807
I did the dishes.
no need to thank me.

570
01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:15.443
Ben. Ben?

571
01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:20.015
Ben!

572
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:24.753
Hailey.

573
01:05:27.724 --> 01:05:28.757
This is unexpected.

574
01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:33.094
I can see how it would be.

575
01:05:34.698 --> 01:05:35.997
Where's Ben?

576
01:05:37.134 --> 01:05:38.466
He's not here.

577
01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:40.035
Yeah. I can see that.

578
01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:41.136
Where is he?

579
01:05:42.773 --> 01:05:44.973
Do you know when
a dog is in pain.

580
01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:46.808
it makes this high pitched tone?

581
01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:49.144
It's excruciating.

582
01:05:54.051 --> 01:05:54.883
Where's Ben?

583
01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:00.755
Where's Ben?!

584
01:06:00.757 --> 01:06:02.023
Where's my son?!

585
01:06:05.896 --> 01:06:06.962
Why are you here?

586
01:06:10.968 --> 01:06:12.734
You're not supposed to be here.

587
01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:15.804
I came to tell
you about Tressa.

588
01:06:50.207 --> 01:06:51.072
Hailey.

589
01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:55.276
What are you doin'?

590
01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:00.015
Okay.

591
01:07:02.152 --> 01:07:03.118
I'll see you later.

592
01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:13.895
You know I can read
your face like a book.

593
01:07:13.897 --> 01:07:15.997
You can't even
read a book. Adam.

594
01:07:15.999 --> 01:07:18.333
Let alone read my face.

595
01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:20.468
Okay. your bid.

596
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:22.203
I'm leaving.

597
01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:23.938
T. hold on. I need your help.

598
01:07:26.043 --> 01:07:27.042
Hey. Tressa.

599
01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:28.309
Off to work?

600
01:07:28.311 --> 01:07:29.244
Isn't that obvious?

601
01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:31.179
Hey. let's show some manners.

602
01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:32.013
Sorry.

603
01:07:32.015 --> 01:07:32.981
Dad. I gotta go.

604
01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:35.350
What
time you coming home?

605
01:07:35.352 --> 01:07:37.352
I don't
know. late. probably.

606
01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:39.187
You want
me to give you a ride?

607
01:07:39.189 --> 01:07:41.189
I'll get Cass to drive me.

608
01:07:41.191 --> 01:07:41.990
Are you sure?

609
01:07:41.992 --> 01:07:43.258
Yeah.

610
01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.060
Does Ben know Hailey's here?

611
01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:46.261
Ah. he knows.

612
01:07:46.263 --> 01:07:48.163
Won't come out of his room.

613
01:07:48.165 --> 01:07:49.898
Okay. I have to go.

614
01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.267
Hey. whoa whoa. hold up.

615
01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:53.635
You forgetting something?

616
01:07:56.673 --> 01:07:58.173
Seeya.

617
01:07:58.175 --> 01:07:59.174
Love you. darling.

618
01:07:59.176 --> 01:08:00.175
I'll save you a plate.

619
01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:01.176
All right.

620
01:08:01.178 --> 01:08:02.143
That right there.

621
01:08:03.213 --> 01:08:04.179
that's my good luck.

622
01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:06.347
Oh. now I should be worried?

623
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:09.651
Indeed you should.

624
01:08:13.356 --> 01:08:14.355
Remember. Hailey.

625
01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:18.693
Daddy needs you to be a
good girl for me tonight.

626
01:08:26.937 --> 01:08:27.802
Okay?

627
01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:31.272
Good girl.

628
01:08:49.159 --> 01:08:50.291
Tressa.

629
01:08:50.293 --> 01:08:51.159
Tressa.

630
01:08:52.262 --> 01:08:54.129
Mr. Adams?

631
01:08:54.131 --> 01:08:55.196
What are you doing here?

632
01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:58.166
What was that?

633
01:08:58.168 --> 01:08:59.033
What?

634
01:09:00.003 --> 01:09:00.835
A cigarette?

635
01:09:02.072 --> 01:09:04.272
What if it's your dad that
pulled up instead of me?

636
01:09:04.274 --> 01:09:06.241
Can you please not tell him?

637
01:09:06.243 --> 01:09:08.176
Please. I promise I
don't do it very often.

638
01:09:08.178 --> 01:09:10.345
Hey. you don't have
to worry about me.

639
01:09:10.347 --> 01:09:13.081
You just have to be
more careful. okay?

640
01:09:13.083 --> 01:09:15.083
Okay. thanks.

641
01:09:15.085 --> 01:09:16.985
Come on. I'll give
you a ride home.

642
01:09:16.987 --> 01:09:19.154
I'm waiting for my
friend. she's closing.

643
01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:22.323
Well. I can give you a ride
home right now if you want.

644
01:09:25.128 --> 01:09:26.661
Okay.

645
01:09:26.663 --> 01:09:28.263
One sec.

646
01:09:28.265 --> 01:09:30.198
Hey. you want a milkshake?

647
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.032
We have mint.

648
01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:35.036
She'd love one.

649
01:10:01.798 --> 01:10:02.630
How was work?

650
01:10:04.034 --> 01:10:05.200
It was okay.

651
01:10:06.403 --> 01:10:08.970
I spilled ketchup
on Mr. Soleman.

652
01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:10.238
Who's that?

653
01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.307
My old history
teacher.

654
01:10:12.309 --> 01:10:14.142
He left a good tip too.

655
01:10:14.144 --> 01:10:15.410
Oh. how could he not?

656
01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:16.644
I'm sure you're probably
one of his favorites.

657
01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:18.313
Uh. no. he hated me.

658
01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:21.249
Why would you say that?

659
01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:24.085
It was the way
he used to stare at me.

660
01:10:28.024 --> 01:10:29.290
Probably admires you.

661
01:10:30.927 --> 01:10:32.293
That's stupid.

662
01:10:36.032 --> 01:10:37.398
Depends on your perspective.

663
01:10:48.245 --> 01:10:49.944
Why are we stopping?

664
01:10:49.946 --> 01:10:52.780
Oh. I thought I heard
something in the engine.

665
01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:55.617
Sounded like a rattling sound.

666
01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:56.651
You don't hear that?

667
01:10:57.721 --> 01:10:59.087
I didn't hear anything.

668
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:02.790
Just let me take a
look. I'll just be a sec.

669
01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:14.702
What are you
doing out this late?

670
01:11:16.539 --> 01:11:18.273
Isn't it way past your bedtime?

671
01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:21.743
What is it?

672
01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:08.589
Your shake's melting.

673
01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:19.033
Wanna know what I was
thinking the whole time?

674
01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:20.234
How much I hated mint.

675
01:12:22.706 --> 01:12:23.571
Where is she?

676
01:12:27.143 --> 01:12:28.009
I don't know.

677
01:12:29.279 --> 01:12:31.012
You don't know?

678
01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:33.181
Why are you telling me this?

679
01:12:33.183 --> 01:12:35.850
Because it wasn't my fault.

680
01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:37.185
I was just a little kid.

681
01:12:38.388 --> 01:12:39.687
You lived under his roof.

682
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:42.857
His blood is in your veins.

683
01:12:44.227 --> 01:12:45.226
He raised you.

684
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:48.563
That doesn't make you innocent.

685
01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:53.968
I'm not my father.

686
01:12:56.172 --> 01:13:01.109
No.

687
01:13:01.378 --> 01:13:06.481
Not yet.

688
01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:22.323
Oh my god!

689
01:15:25.522 --> 01:15:26.387
Do it!

690
01:15:27.824 --> 01:15:28.689
Do it!

691
01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:31.926
Do it.

692
01:15:34.564 --> 01:15:35.897
I told you.

693
01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:37.698
I'm not my father.

694
01:15:47.644 --> 01:15:49.877
Do you believe I was
never a violent man?

695
01:15:53.483 --> 01:15:54.749
I had the hammer.

696
01:15:56.653 --> 01:15:57.485
I was ready.

697
01:15:59.222 --> 01:15:59.787
I needed to.

698
01:16:03.092 --> 01:16:03.958
I wanted to.

699
01:16:07.397 --> 01:16:08.629
I went to your home.

700
01:16:09.599 --> 01:16:11.666
To make him pay for what he did.

701
01:16:15.038 --> 01:16:16.337
But he was already dead.

702
01:16:19.442 --> 01:16:20.308
A stroke.

703
01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:25.613
He died peacefully

704
01:16:28.518 --> 01:16:31.752
when my daughter
decayed somewhere

705
01:16:33.289 --> 01:16:34.522
I'll never know!

706
01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:42.763
Goodbye. Gregory.

707
01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:43.965
Where are you going?

708
01:16:45.301 --> 01:16:46.167
Hailey!

709
01:16:47.604 --> 01:16:48.469
Hailey!

710
01:16:49.405 --> 01:16:50.271
Hailey!
