Come on. Up.

179
00:13:24.064 --> 00:13:26.108
Yeah. We're going down
the basement.

180
00:13:27.762 --> 00:13:29.068
That's right.

181
00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:31.592
Keep going.

00:13:35.901 --> 00:13:37.338
[Don] Watch your step.

183
00:13:43.735 --> 00:13:46.913
Uh. can I go hang out
with a friend tonight?

184
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.524
Well. you asked nicely. yes.

185
00:13:51.439 --> 00:13:52.700
-Here?

[Sarah] What is this place?

189
00:14:07.803 --> 00:14:10.501
Previous owner
built a bomb shelter.

190
00:14:10.588 --> 00:14:12.025
I made some improvements.

191
00:14:17.117 --> 00:14:19.205
Well. put that end over there.

192
00:14:21.991 --> 00:14:24.123
And here we go.

193
00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:27.083
What do you think?

194
00:14:27.169 --> 00:14:30.260
[Sarah] I mean. it kinda sucks.
There is no windows.

195
00:14:30.304 --> 00:14:32.001
You don't like it?

196
00:14:34.351 --> 00:14:37.049
-Dad.
-That's too bad.

197
00:14:37.136 --> 00:14:39.747

[Amy] Mom. I'm sure she's fine.

227
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.930
She's probably
just at a friend's house.

228
00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:02.412
What friend? I called all her
friends. nobody's seen her.

229
00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:04.283
-I'm calling the cops.
-Reenie.

230
00:17:04.327 --> 00:17:06.721
Let's just go to sleep.
She'll be here when we wake up.

231
00:17:07.677 --> 00:17:09.376
I'm calling the cops.

232
00:17:10.637 --> 00:17:12.161

Ah!

250
00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:24.205
You can't do this to me.

251
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.251
Yes. I can.

252
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.212
I can't breathe. There's no air.

253
00:19:30.255 --> 00:19:34.564
As long as there's power.
there's air.

254

Three failed attempts on
the keypad shuts the power off.

Why are you doing this?

259

Life is a series

Action. reaction.

261
00:20:00.589 --> 00:20:02.940
Choices. consequences.

262
00:20:02.983 --> 00:20:06.770
You chose to be disrespectful.
and this is your consequence.

263
00:20:06.813 --> 00:20:10.470
Help! Someone! Ugh.

264
00:20:10.557 --> 00:20:14.038
This vent
is where you get your air

00:20:14.081 --> 00:20:15.997

266
00:20:16.084 --> 00:20:19.392
You eat when I say you do.

267
00:20:19.479 --> 00:20:23.482
You want a blanket. a book.

268
00:20:23.569 --> 00:20:27.617
you can have those things
if I say you can.

269
00:20:27.703 --> 00:20:32.405
Everything that you get now.
every privilege. you will earn.

00:20:36.321 --> 00:20:38.933

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.329
Fine.

Well. it's not like her.
I mean. she still hasn't called.

285
00:22:25.126 --> 00:22:28.085
She promised that she wouldn't
run off like that again.

286
00:22:28.128 --> 00:22:30.348
She broke a lot of promises.

287
00:22:31.959 --> 00:22:33.351
This is my husband. Don.

288
00:22:33.439 --> 00:22:35.309
-Nice to meet you.
-Sir.

289
00:22:35.396 --> 00:22:36.571
Well. she's run off before.
right?

290
00:22:36.658 --> 00:22:37.572
[Don] Yes.
[Irene] No.

291
00:22:37.659 --> 00:22:39.270
It was to a party.

292
00:22:39.357 --> 00:22:41.751
This is different.
She came right back.

293
00:22:41.838 --> 00:22:44.405
Well. she's 18. which means she
can come and go as she pleases.

294
00:22:44.492 --> 00:22:47.757
Isn't it likely that she decided
she needed some space

295
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.975
and is staying with friends?

296
00:22:49.062 --> 00:22:50.978
She doesn't have
that many friends.

297
00:22:51.065 --> 00:22:53.415
I've talked to all the ones
that I know.

298
00:22:53.459 --> 00:22:57.288
-Boyfriend?
-Chris hasn't seen her.

299
00:22:57.376 --> 00:22:59.247
[Amy] And he seems
like a pretty nice guy.

300
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.379
Chris who? You got a number?

301
00:23:01.423 --> 00:23:03.251
Yeah. I'll go get it.

302
00:23:04.818 --> 00:23:07.124
All right. We'll talk to him.

303
00:23:07.167 --> 00:23:08.255
Did you guys notice
anything missing?

304
00:23:08.343 --> 00:23:10.126
Clothes. personal items?

305
00:23:10.171 --> 00:23:13.392
Uh. yes. Some clothes
and a travel bag.

306
00:23:14.957 --> 00:23:18.440
-Did you tell him her plans?
-What plan?

307
00:23:18.527 --> 00:23:20.921
She wants to visit
all 50 states.

308
00:23:21.008 --> 00:23:24.011
Don. it's not really a plan.

309
00:23:24.706 --> 00:23:26.360
She's a dreamer.

310
00:23:26.447 --> 00:23:29.059
And she said
that when she turned 18.

311
00:23:29.145 --> 00:23:31.409
that she was gonna go
from Florida

312
00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:35.108
and work her way
across the country.

313
00:23:35.152 --> 00:23:36.936
But she hasn't had
her birthday yet.

314
00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.939
[sobbing] And she wouldn't leave

315
00:23:38.982 --> 00:23:41.157
without saying goodbye to me.

316
00:23:41.244 --> 00:23:43.464
She wouldn't.

317
00:23:43.551 --> 00:23:45.466
We've already filed
a missing person's report.

318
00:23:45.511 --> 00:23:46.685
But without any leads.
that's about all

319
00:23:46.772 --> 00:23:48.949
I can do at this point.

320
00:23:49.036 --> 00:23:51.038
And I've been doing this
for 20 years.

321
00:23:51.125 --> 00:23:54.301
Usually. these situations
resolve themselves.

322

00:26:15.835 --> 00:26:17.052
The cop. cops called me
looking for her.

359
00:26:17.139 --> 00:26:18.097

361
00:26:21.013 --> 00:26:23.103
Just wanted to.
I wanted to bring her this.

362
00:26:23.145 --> 00:26:25.408
Um. she didn't tell you?

363
00:26:26.888 --> 00:26:28.803
Tell me what?

364
00:26:28.847 --> 00:26:31.154
She didn't say anything
about Steve?

365
00:26:31.197 --> 00:26:33.591
S-Steve? Steve who?

366
00:26:34.504 --> 00:26:37.203
[sighs]
Sarah and Steve

367
00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:38.857
were best friends
in the old neighborhood

368
00:26:38.944 --> 00:26:40.816
since. like. first grade.

369
00:26:40.859 --> 00:26:42.861

that Sarah ran off
with some guy named Steve?

373
00:26:55.003 --> 00:26:57.658
My wife said they're in Florida.
She was working as a waitress.

374
00:26:57.745 --> 00:27:01.357
Now. you're sure she didn't say
anything about Steve?

375
00:27:01.402 --> 00:27:05.885
I remember she. uh.
she-she mentioned Florida.

376
00:27:05.927 --> 00:27:09.540

And in return.
you have given your mother and I

nothing but selfish disrespect.

433
00:31:53.259 --> 00:31:58.089

-No.
-Why not?

we're not gonna waste
anymore money on this.

Don't you wonder
what happened to her?

Don't you wonder
if. if she's happy?

I'm never giving up. Don.

495
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.392

what kind of money it costs.

Once upon a time
there was a fairy princess.

539
00:40:07.665 --> 00:40:11.626
And she was in love
with a handsome prince.

540

What was his name?

541
00:40:13.453 --> 00:40:17.283
His name
was Good Prince Christopher.

542
00:40:19.894 --> 00:40:21.810
And he played the lute.

543
00:40:21.854 --> 00:40:26.466
And one day
the princess's evil father

544
00:40:26.553 --> 00:40:28.338
found out
about Prince Christopher

545
00:40:28.381 --> 00:40:32.647
and he was so mad that he
chopped off his daughter's wings

546
00:40:32.734 --> 00:40:35.432
and he locked her
in a cave underground.

547
00:40:37.957 --> 00:40:40.872
And the princess was so lonely.

548
00:40:40.959 --> 00:40:44.832
But. but then one day.

549
00:40:44.919 --> 00:40:47.182
her fairy godmother came

550
00:40:47.269 --> 00:40:50.490
and brought her a little girl
to keep her company.

551
00:40:50.577 --> 00:40:53.232
And they were so happy
that she came back

552

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:53.685
And I'm done raising kids.

712
00:49:55.861 --> 00:49:57.515
What about Reenie?

713
00:50:04.305 --> 00:50:07.569
There's not enough room
down here for two kids.

714
00:50:07.656 --> 00:50:10.571
Definitely not three.

715
00:50:10.658 --> 00:50:14.010
And if I didn't spend so much
time taking care of him...

716
00:50:15.794 --> 00:50:18.711
I would have way more time
to take care of you.

-Calm down. honey.

722
00:50:44.127 --> 00:50:45.912
Hi. baby.

723
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:53.615
[Sarah] Dear mom.
I hope you're doing okay.

724
00:50:53.658 --> 00:50:55.225
-What? Sarah?
-I'm sorry I haven't called.

725
00:50:55.312 --> 00:50:57.488
-Or written.
-[sighs] You're alive.

726
00:50:57.575 --> 00:50:59.620
[Sarah] I have a boyfriend now.
and we're dong okay.

727
00:50:59.664 --> 00:51:02.493
but there's no time or money
for a baby right now.

728
00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.147
-Oh. my God.
-This is Thomas.

729
00:51:04.191 --> 00:51:06.453
I hope you'll take
good care of him for me

730
00:51:06.497 --> 00:51:08.629
until I can come for him.

731
00:51:08.673 --> 00:51:11.937
I love you and miss you. Sarah.

732
00:51:14.374 --> 00:51:17.812

Don. Don...

735
00:51:23.428 --> 00:51:25.865
This is Sarah's baby.

736
00:51:25.952 --> 00:51:27.258
She was here.

737
00:51:28.519 --> 00:51:30.957
-Sarah was here.
-No.

738
00:51:33.785 --> 00:51:35.265
Oh. come on. baby.

Shh...

745
00:52:09.691 --> 00:52:10.952
Hey.

746
00:52:11.039 --> 00:52:13.477
-How'd it go?
-Fine.

747
00:52:13.564 --> 00:52:16.437
Just one little hiccup.

in the basement.

You haven't learned a thing.

751
00:52:32.497 --> 00:52:34.325
Now put this on.

[clock ticking]

753
00:52:49.644 --> 00:52:52.256
[Marie] Once upon a time
there was a little girl

754
00:52:52.343 --> 00:52:54.780
who lived in a dark cave
with her mother.

755
00:52:54.867 --> 00:52:56.825
who was once a fairy princess.

756
00:52:56.912 --> 00:52:59.740
One day a fairy godmother
brought a little boy

757
00:52:59.785 --> 00:53:01.352
for the little girl
to play with.

758
00:53:01.394 --> 00:53:03.223
They loved playing together.

759
00:53:03.267 --> 00:53:05.356
They went
on amazing adventures.

760
00:53:05.443 --> 00:53:09.098
to the rainforest.
the jungle and even the moon.

761
00:53:09.185 --> 00:53:10.752
where they met an alien.

762
00:53:10.839 --> 00:53:13.015
Even though
they argued sometimes.

763
00:53:13.102 --> 00:53:15.278
they were very happy.

764
00:53:15.321 --> 00:53:18.238
Her mother's Prince Charming
was still wandering.

765
00:53:18.325 --> 00:53:20.544
trying to find
his fairy princess.

766
00:53:20.631 --> 00:53:23.504
He sang the special song
he wrote for her.

767
00:53:23.591 --> 00:53:27.508
and never gave up. The little
girl never gave up either.

768
00:53:27.595 --> 00:53:30.423
She knew that one day
she and her mother

769
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:32.470
and her brother
would be rescued...

770
00:53:32.557 --> 00:53:34.602
[Marie] ...and live
happily ever after.

771
00:53:34.689 --> 00:53:36.908
-[Sarah] Wow!
-[cheering]

772
00:53:36.995 --> 00:53:39.084
Thank you. Thank you.

773
00:53:47.093 --> 00:53:48.093
Ah.

774
00:53:49.443 --> 00:53:51.923
Stop. Stay still.

775
00:53:51.966 --> 00:53:54.055
Let me see. Okay. you're done.

776
00:53:54.142 --> 00:53:55.928
Well. looks cool.

777
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:57.276
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

778
00:53:57.321 --> 00:53:59.278

779
00:53:59.365 --> 00:54:01.673

-[Michael] Really?

780
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.979

You look like a clown.

00:54:04.066 --> 00:54:06.591
-Yeah. says you.
-Hey. what are you doing?

782
00:54:06.678 --> 00:54:08.287
-Make-up.
-[Sarah] No.

783
00:54:08.332 --> 00:54:10.464
You're not wearing make-up.

784
00:54:10.551 --> 00:54:12.073
Come here.

785
00:54:16.861 --> 00:54:20.430
You are very. very beautiful.

787
00:54:26.524 --> 00:54:27.785
Come here.

Hey! Come here. set the table.

789

Michael. help your sister.

790
00:54:37.403 --> 00:54:39.928
You don't touch her.

791
00:54:40.015 --> 00:54:42.452
Please leave her alone.

792
00:54:44.062 --> 00:54:45.499
Take this with you.

793
00:54:45.542 --> 00:54:47.631
She doesn't need it.
She's just a kid.

What's goin' on?
Will you talk to me?

801
00:55:16.921 --> 00:55:18.662
I don't know anyone.

802
00:55:19.881 --> 00:55:22.709
I don't have any friends.

803
00:55:22.754 --> 00:55:25.930
What if I never meet anyone?

804
00:55:26.017 --> 00:55:28.847
What if I never meet a nice boy?

00:55:30.674 --> 00:55:32.024
You will.

-I'm working on it.

807
00:55:35.767 --> 00:55:37.334
I promise.

You just have to be patient.

00:55:42.687 --> 00:55:44.689
How did you meet dad?

810
00:55:55.089 --> 00:55:58.049
I've known your father
almost my whole life.

811
00:55:59.921 --> 00:56:02.575
Well. I think
that when we get out of here.

812
00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.709
maybe you should get a divorce.

813

she's never coming back. Um...

doesn't know everything.

will be able to
