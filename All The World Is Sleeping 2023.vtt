3
00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:22.821
Okay.
So these are the rules.

4
00:01:22.952 --> 00:01:25.259
You have to get
from here to there

5
00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:28.175
without touching
the floor or the light.

6
00:01:28.305 --> 00:01:30.177
All right. Bearbear.
you can do this.

7
00:01:30.307 --> 00:01:32.440
Just have to go slow.
okay?

8
00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.541
You can do it. Bearbear.
You just have to jump.

9
00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:48.586
Okay. ready?

10
00:02:12.915 --> 00:02:15.265
Sometimes I can feel
the sky as it rotates.

11
00:02:20.488 --> 00:02:22.968
It scatters my thoughts.
creating this...

12
00:02:24.753 --> 00:02:26.015
sound.

13
00:02:28.322 --> 00:02:29.410
And it'll grow louder.

14
00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:32.413
More aggressive.

15
00:02:35.198 --> 00:02:36.417
Like two people fighting.

16
00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:42.292
I look up and I know
I can keep my shit together.

17
00:02:44.816 --> 00:02:46.296
And then it rains.

18
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:55.887
It's gonna stop.
baby girl.

19
00:03:56.018 --> 00:03:58.890
If it doesn't.
I'll be the only kid in class

20
00:03:58.977 --> 00:04:00.240
with an indoor swimming pool.

21
00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.374
Ooh. quefancy.

22
00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:08.552
You don't need a flood
to stand out.

23
00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:11.381
You've got grease
all over your face.

24
00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:16.430
Oh. yeah.
You. like. totally got it now.

25
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.214
It looks all bad.

26
00:04:27.049 --> 00:04:28.268
It will grow louder.

27
00:04:31.183 --> 00:04:32.576
The lights will turn off.

28
00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:35.492
The roof will cave in.

29
00:04:38.974 --> 00:04:40.323
Everything will fall apart.

30
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:45.110
And I wonder
if you can hear me.

31
00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.314
Don't let go.

32
00:05:15.837 --> 00:05:16.794
Don't let go.

33
00:05:18.274 --> 00:05:19.319
Please.

34
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:38.990
Hold your hand.

35
00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:41.776
No. don't let me.
It's my fault. I did it.

36
00:05:42.951 --> 00:05:44.605
Who's she talking to?

37
00:05:47.956 --> 00:05:49.000
Jesus.

38
00:05:49.392 --> 00:05:50.524
Is he listening?

39
00:05:51.655 --> 00:05:52.700
I don't know. baby girl.

40
00:05:54.005 --> 00:05:55.311
Is she crazy?

41
00:06:01.883 --> 00:06:03.101
I don't know. baby girl.

42
00:06:03.232 --> 00:06:04.189
You're on fire.

43
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.539
You set it on fire!

44
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:10.892
I'm holding your fucking hand.

45
00:06:11.022 --> 00:06:13.808
fuck you. you fucking
ugly fucker. fucker. fucker...

46
00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:17.289
Hold your hand.
I'm holding your hand.

47
00:06:31.826 --> 00:06:32.870
You got lost.
Chama. or what?

48
00:06:34.002 --> 00:06:35.220
Where you going?

49
00:06:37.135 --> 00:06:38.702
Don't be all nosy. Matias.

50
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.879
She has a job interview.

51
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.838
Oh. where at?

52
00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:45.535
You my PO now or something?

53
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.376
Look. it's. like.
a good job opportunity. okay?

54
00:07:00.898 --> 00:07:02.552
Gonna pay real good.

55
00:07:02.683 --> 00:07:03.423
then you won't be
seeing us no more.

56
00:07:07.818 --> 00:07:08.906
Who names their kid Chama?

57
00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:12.867
It's short for Elena.

58
00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:16.784
-No. it isn't.
-It is. if I say it is.

59
00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:19.874
Anybody ever tell you
you got spiders in your veins?

60
00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:21.310
Anyone ever tell you
to put on some shoes?

61
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:33.235
Come on. baby.
get your bag.

62
00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:36.630
That you?

63
00:07:37.587 --> 00:07:38.719
Yeah. that's me.

64
00:07:39.197 --> 00:07:40.547
Hey. good luck out there.

65
00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:47.205
Let me see.

66
00:07:48.032 --> 00:07:49.381
You're gonna lose everything if
you don't close your backpack.

67
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:51.775
Come on.
Got everything you need?

68
00:07:52.515 --> 00:07:54.561
Mm-hmm.

69
00:07:54.648 --> 00:07:55.866
I'm gonna be right here.
waiting for you after school.

70
00:07:55.997 --> 00:07:56.824
Really?

71
00:07:57.607 --> 00:07:59.087
Yes. really.

72
00:07:59.217 --> 00:08:00.305
Are you gonna
give me shit today. too?

73
00:08:00.436 --> 00:08:01.829
Come on.

74
00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.308
-I love you.
-I love you.

75
00:08:07.748 --> 00:08:08.836
Have fun.

76
00:08:24.155 --> 00:08:25.679
I remember being her age.

77
00:08:28.682 --> 00:08:29.770
That's when
I learned how to lie.

78
00:08:31.423 --> 00:08:33.164
I used to tell teachers
I was sick.

79
00:08:33.687 --> 00:08:34.818
That's why
I was missing school.

80
00:08:37.038 --> 00:08:38.779
When I did go.
I tried to blend in.

81
00:08:39.606 --> 00:08:41.477
I brushed my hair.

82
00:08:41.608 --> 00:08:42.739
cleaned my nails...

83
00:08:44.132 --> 00:08:46.830
but inside I felt
ants crawling up my skin.

84
00:08:48.876 --> 00:08:51.139
I just wanted to grow up.
so everything would be better.

85
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:52.401
Give me a chance.

86
00:08:54.708 --> 00:08:55.839
I can do the work.

87
00:08:57.667 --> 00:08:58.799
I can!

88
00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:00.757
I'm sure you can.

89
00:09:01.453 --> 00:09:04.152
Come on. quiz me.
I know this shit.

90
00:09:04.282 --> 00:09:05.545
When I was younger
I used to watch

91
00:09:05.675 --> 00:09:07.155
my abuelo
tear cars apart.

92
00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:09.244
He taught me
literally everything.

93
00:09:09.984 --> 00:09:12.421
I got an '85
Buick LeSabre I rebuilt.

94
00:09:13.204 --> 00:09:14.597
Runs perfectly...

95
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.599
if it had a fuel pump.

96
00:09:17.252 --> 00:09:18.949
But I can't get
a new fuel pump

97
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.560
if I don't got a job
and if I don't got a job...

98
00:09:21.952 --> 00:09:23.345
Look.

99
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.043
I'm just trying
to get back on my feet. okay?

100
00:09:31.527 --> 00:09:32.528
I have a daughter.

101
00:09:36.314 --> 00:09:38.665
Look. the economy's
kicking my ass.

102
00:09:38.795 --> 00:09:40.231
I'm just not hiring right now.

103
00:11:31.125 --> 00:11:33.518
Abueloused to say that
if you find a black feather...

104
00:11:37.044 --> 00:11:38.132
it's a warning.

105
00:15:57.304 --> 00:15:58.740
We made dinner.

106
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:59.784
There's some left
in the fridge.

107
00:16:01.134 --> 00:16:02.439
She's sleeping. Elena.

108
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.963
She's my daughter.

109
00:16:04.615 --> 00:16:05.921
I know she's sleeping. okay?

110
00:16:07.096 --> 00:16:08.619
Don't look at me
like that.

111
00:16:09.403 --> 00:16:11.753
-You're in my home.
-That the state pays for.

112
00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.412
I was robbed. okay?

113
00:16:19.065 --> 00:16:20.109
Don't pretend
like you care.

114
00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:23.243
Because
if you gave two shits.

115
00:16:23.373 --> 00:16:25.027
you'd drive around
and look for them.

116
00:16:25.158 --> 00:16:27.421
Oh. I would drive around
and look for your shoes?

117
00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:29.249
Why would you ever want to
look for the imaginary person

118
00:16:29.379 --> 00:16:30.598
who stole your shoes.
Elena?

119
00:16:30.728 --> 00:16:32.208
That's not my name.

120
00:16:32.339 --> 00:16:33.296
Stop talking to me
like a child.

121
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.472
You know.
Friday's her birthday.

122
00:16:35.603 --> 00:16:37.083
I fucking know
Friday's her birthday.

123
00:16:37.213 --> 00:16:38.606
If you weren't my sister--

124
00:16:38.693 --> 00:16:41.174
So. what?
You'd go? So fucking go!

125
00:16:41.304 --> 00:16:42.871
You are just like Mom.

126
00:16:44.394 --> 00:16:45.656
One of these times...

127
00:16:46.179 --> 00:16:47.267
they're gonna take her away.

128
00:16:51.227 --> 00:16:52.707
Get the fuck out
of my house.

129
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:54.839
Get the fuck out!

130
00:19:07.668 --> 00:19:08.973
You know.
I used to have this dream...

131
00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:11.411
that I got.
like. no face...

132
00:19:12.455 --> 00:19:14.805
and I'm just a shadow.

133
00:19:14.936 --> 00:19:16.155
floating over the desert.

134
00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:21.290
And I got. like.
this bag of hammers

135
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:23.510
and I'm just. like.
chucking them at cows.

136
00:19:24.206 --> 00:19:25.686
What do you think
that means?

137
00:19:26.295 --> 00:19:27.862
That you need
serious help.

138
00:19:27.992 --> 00:19:30.038
Toaster always
showed up when I needed her.

139
00:19:37.959 --> 00:19:39.787
You can't just.
like. open it.

140
00:19:39.917 --> 00:19:42.355
-Why not?
-You broke it.

141
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.400
Last year.
Nevaeh loved red.

142
00:19:45.401 --> 00:19:48.361
I think this year.
she likes the color purple.

143
00:19:49.927 --> 00:19:52.191
Like that Oprah movie
about racism?

144
00:19:54.628 --> 00:19:56.456
Balloons.

145
00:20:06.944 --> 00:20:08.468
You never. like.
look up your dreams

146
00:20:08.598 --> 00:20:09.643
and find out
what they mean?

147
00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:12.385
I don't dream.

148
00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:15.562
Every bitch dreams.

149
00:20:15.692 --> 00:20:17.520
Come on. you probably
just don't remember it.

150
00:20:17.651 --> 00:20:18.782
Mm-mm.

151
00:20:21.916 --> 00:20:23.700
Maybe that's what I'll study
when I go back to school.

152
00:20:26.399 --> 00:20:27.530
Why Chama don't dream?

153
00:20:30.794 --> 00:20:32.622
Stupid. Siempre.

154
00:20:32.753 --> 00:20:35.103
No.

155
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.584
No. for serious.

156
00:20:39.412 --> 00:20:41.762
I'm going back.

157
00:20:41.892 --> 00:20:44.286
Toaster is one of those
bitches from the Heights.

158
00:20:44.417 --> 00:20:46.332
She actually knew her father.

159
00:20:46.419 --> 00:20:48.377
He'd buy her things.

160
00:20:48.508 --> 00:20:50.771
She never worried
about nothing.

161
00:20:50.901 --> 00:20:53.252
Toaster was all cool.

162
00:20:53.382 --> 00:20:54.731
And I wanted to be her.

163
00:20:56.603 --> 00:20:57.604
She was a dreamer.

164
00:20:58.431 --> 00:20:59.388
I'm going back.

165
00:21:01.738 --> 00:21:02.957
My dad's gonna pay.

166
00:21:04.915 --> 00:21:06.700
It's gonna be
like it used to be. you know?

167
00:21:08.005 --> 00:21:09.268
He's gonna be proud of me.

168
00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:13.402
I don't know.
maybe I'll be just. like...

169
00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:16.405
some counselor. you know?

170
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:20.757
Like. help
all these bitches out.

171
00:21:23.804 --> 00:21:25.066
I could tell 'em what's up.

172
00:21:28.504 --> 00:21:30.680
Toaster always
showed up when I needed her.

173
00:21:30.811 --> 00:21:33.292
She'd help me fix everything.

174
00:21:38.514 --> 00:21:40.081
I can make my daughter happy.

175
00:21:44.999 --> 00:21:46.783
I can keep my shit together.

176
00:21:54.704 --> 00:21:56.445
I can make
my daughter happy.

177
00:21:56.576 --> 00:21:58.317
I can make
my daughter happy.

178
00:22:07.064 --> 00:22:10.677
I can make
my daughter happy.

179
00:22:10.807 --> 00:22:13.593
I can make my daughter happy.
I can make my daughter happy.

180
00:22:13.723 --> 00:22:15.943
I can make
my daughter happy.

181
00:22:16.073 --> 00:22:17.945
I can keep my shit together.
I can make my daughter happy.

182
00:22:18.032 --> 00:22:19.338
I can make
my daughter happy.

183
00:22:21.078 --> 00:22:22.645
I can keep
my shit together.

184
00:22:24.081 --> 00:22:25.779
I can make
my daughter happy.

185
00:22:28.912 --> 00:22:30.653
I can keep
my shit together.

186
00:23:49.515 --> 00:23:50.690
Hey. baby girl.
what's wrong?

187
00:23:51.778 --> 00:23:52.779
I don't know.

188
00:23:53.823 --> 00:23:55.042
Hey.

189
00:23:55.172 --> 00:23:56.565
Don't let bullshit push you.

190
00:24:04.704 --> 00:24:06.314
Sometimes I just
want to hide. too.

191
00:24:08.751 --> 00:24:09.796
Just. like. run away.

192
00:24:13.582 --> 00:24:15.279
But everybody's already here.

193
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.456
so you might as well
just take all their presents.

194
00:24:27.988 --> 00:24:29.816
You were born two months early.
you know why?

195
00:24:30.904 --> 00:24:32.209
Hmm?

196
00:24:33.297 --> 00:24:35.299
Because you were
so excited to meet your mama.

197
00:24:36.953 --> 00:24:38.477
And I was to meet you.

198
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:42.350
There she is.

199
00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:48.835
You're my baby girl.
you're all I got.

200
00:24:50.967 --> 00:24:51.968
You're all I got.

201
00:24:56.625 --> 00:24:57.931
I hope that's not true.

202
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.849
Go on.
Have fun. it's your birthday.

203
00:25:51.811 --> 00:25:53.029
I can keep my shit.

204
00:25:56.816 --> 00:25:58.034
Elena?

205
00:26:28.978 --> 00:26:29.675
Elena. are you in there?

206
00:26:43.819 --> 00:26:45.691
Come on. Open up.

207
00:26:45.778 --> 00:26:47.170
Elena.

208
00:26:47.867 --> 00:26:48.911
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

209
00:26:50.783 --> 00:26:52.872
You did all right--
good. okay?

210
00:26:54.177 --> 00:26:55.614
Not out here to talk shit.

211
00:26:59.226 --> 00:27:00.619
Hey.

212
00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:04.448
Let's just
go out and sing.

213
00:27:19.072 --> 00:27:20.073
Look. you know what?

214
00:27:22.205 --> 00:27:23.511
You don't get to do this.

215
00:27:25.078 --> 00:27:26.645
Not today.
this isn't about you.

216
00:27:31.475 --> 00:27:34.130
You think you're so special

217
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:35.784
and that nobody else matters.
but guess what?

218
00:27:37.786 --> 00:27:38.961
They do.

219
00:28:03.725 --> 00:28:04.857
Somebody help me!

220
00:28:06.946 --> 00:28:08.556
Somebody help!

221
00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:12.778
Now!

222
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.010
I know
what you all are thinking.

223
00:28:29.185 --> 00:28:30.752
Shit gets all fucked.

224
00:28:31.274 --> 00:28:32.667
But that's just
the way it goes.

225
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.584
I had this
one bitch try to tell me.

226
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:39.674
"If you just got a real job.
everything would be all right."

227
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.764
Bitch! I have a felony.

228
00:28:42.895 --> 00:28:44.853
Who's gonna hire me?
Who's gonna teach me?

229
00:28:45.811 --> 00:28:47.769
All I know
is selling dope. hustling.

230
00:28:48.378 --> 00:28:50.250
That's all anyone
was willing to show me.

231
00:28:51.338 --> 00:28:54.950
So. with four little brothers
at home. yeah.

232
00:28:55.081 --> 00:28:58.084
I was gonna hustle
to buy them food and. yeah.

233
00:28:58.214 --> 00:29:00.086
I was gonna smoke to forget
everything I had done.

234
00:29:01.174 --> 00:29:02.088
And yeah.

235
00:29:03.219 --> 00:29:04.917
Shit's gonna get fucked.

236
00:29:28.114 --> 00:29:29.550
I was once a little girl.

237
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.772
Trying to keep my sister safe.

238
00:29:37.427 --> 00:29:38.994
I thought
it would all work out.

239
00:29:42.519 --> 00:29:43.912
I used to run toAbuelo's.

240
00:29:46.567 --> 00:29:47.960
He showed me
how to fix things.

241
00:29:52.442 --> 00:29:53.748
You showed me
how to break them.

242
00:29:59.362 --> 00:30:00.799
You fucking took them. huh?

243
00:30:00.886 --> 00:30:01.930
Let's go.

244
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.334
You drove around
with bottles on the floor.

245
00:30:14.464 --> 00:30:16.205
Your music turned up.

246
00:30:16.336 --> 00:30:18.033
You'd smoke a full pack.

247
00:30:18.164 --> 00:30:20.514
but you still
smelled like roses.

248
00:30:24.692 --> 00:30:26.825
We cried as you pulled
the glass out of our skin.

249
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.310
I am my mother's daughter.

250
00:30:34.441 --> 00:30:35.790
Elena.

251
00:30:45.104 --> 00:30:46.670
Can you tell me
what you were doing?

252
00:30:50.239 --> 00:30:51.675
You're lucky to be alive.

253
00:30:54.374 --> 00:30:56.158
If it hadn't been for
the Narcan you'd be dead...

254
00:30:58.204 --> 00:31:00.032
you probably
wouldn't be here right now.

255
00:31:04.558 --> 00:31:05.951
How much do you normally use?

256
00:31:09.693 --> 00:31:11.739
Was it an accident
or was it intentional?

257
00:31:31.237 --> 00:31:32.978
It's a selfish act.

258
00:31:33.108 --> 00:31:33.979
especially
when you're pregnant.

259
00:31:52.127 --> 00:31:53.041
You didn't know?

260
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.428
I was 21.

261
00:32:34.082 --> 00:32:35.779
I'd work on cars. because...

262
00:32:36.998 --> 00:32:38.043
what else am I gonna do?

263
00:32:51.317 --> 00:32:53.145
It was also
the last time I used a needle.

264
00:32:54.755 --> 00:32:55.930
Nobody knew.

265
00:32:57.062 --> 00:32:57.976
I was quiet.

266
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.414
But I always
seemed in control.

267
00:33:03.807 --> 00:33:04.852
You're doing it all wrong.

268
00:33:06.723 --> 00:33:07.986
You should be cranking it
the other way. you know?

269
00:33:10.336 --> 00:33:12.033
I'm tightening the tensioner.

270
00:33:12.599 --> 00:33:14.949
Going clockwise.
so the nut can do its job.

271
00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:18.953
That's what's up.

272
00:33:22.478 --> 00:33:23.349
You know. I see you.

273
00:33:26.439 --> 00:33:28.006
You was down
at Chopay's the other day.

274
00:33:28.963 --> 00:33:30.312
Looking all cool and shit.

275
00:33:33.794 --> 00:33:36.884
I see you and I want to
holler at you. mija.

276
00:33:39.147 --> 00:33:40.018
Why?

277
00:33:42.411 --> 00:33:43.369
Because you look like
you need someone to.

278
00:33:49.201 --> 00:33:50.202
So what it is?

279
00:33:51.725 --> 00:33:53.031
Can I help you
start it or what?

280
00:34:08.785 --> 00:34:11.223
Santi was all bad.

281
00:34:11.353 --> 00:34:12.876
Smelled like
hairspray and sweat.

282
00:34:15.749 --> 00:34:17.142
Reminded me ofAbuelo.

283
00:34:19.361 --> 00:34:20.232
Know how many times he lost?

284
00:34:22.495 --> 00:34:23.800
Five.

285
00:34:23.931 --> 00:34:25.541
He worshiped boxing

286
00:34:25.628 --> 00:34:27.413
and the boxers
who wouldn't quit.

287
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.414
Know how many times
he's got back up and won?

288
00:34:29.328 --> 00:34:30.720
59. baby!

289
00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:33.680
He just sticks out his tongue
and he knows no matter

290
00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:35.551
where he grow up.
no matter how he grow up.

291
00:34:35.638 --> 00:34:36.770
what he could do.
you know what I mean?

292
00:34:38.598 --> 00:34:40.469
He says.

293
00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.471
"Hey. pass me the ball.
pass me the bills.

294
00:34:43.646 --> 00:34:45.518
Albuquerque.

295
00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:48.216
Up to you. champ.
Albuquerque.

296
00:34:48.347 --> 00:34:50.262
I'm still the champ.

297
00:34:50.392 --> 00:34:52.264
Hey. Grandma. Grandpa.
I'm still your champ!"

298
00:34:54.396 --> 00:34:55.789
I'd tattoo him on my body.

299
00:34:57.747 --> 00:34:59.227
And he promised
to never let me get sick.

300
00:35:01.447 --> 00:35:04.276
We'd get a house together.

301
00:35:04.406 --> 00:35:08.193
I'd get pregnant.
Stop using.

302
00:35:08.323 --> 00:35:11.544
I'd worship him.
because he gave me Nevaeh.

303
00:35:11.674 --> 00:35:15.330
She'd be born at home.
just like I was.

304
00:35:15.461 --> 00:35:17.811
He'd play the guitar
for our daughter.

305
00:35:17.941 --> 00:35:19.465
He wasn't very good.
but I didn't know any better.

306
00:35:21.902 --> 00:35:23.077
Then he was gone.

307
00:35:24.426 --> 00:35:25.427
I was alone.

308
00:35:26.776 --> 00:35:28.082
And seven years later...

309
00:35:47.623 --> 00:35:48.929
I need you to nod your head

310
00:35:49.016 --> 00:35:50.322
that you understand
what's going on.

311
00:35:52.454 --> 00:35:53.499
It's in your best interest.

312
00:35:58.504 --> 00:36:00.767
An investigator from CPS
is gonna sit down

313
00:36:00.897 --> 00:36:01.942
-with your daughter.
-No.

314
00:36:03.378 --> 00:36:04.553
You're going to scare her.

315
00:36:05.119 --> 00:36:06.512
She's already scared.

316
00:36:13.562 --> 00:36:14.737
We've got a house
full of love.

317
00:36:14.868 --> 00:36:16.739
you don't even know.

318
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:18.219
Do you have a contact
number for her father?

319
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:19.307
What do you think
he's gonna do?

320
00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:22.005
You just want
to take away my baby.

321
00:36:22.136 --> 00:36:24.182
Our intention
is never to remove a child

322
00:36:24.312 --> 00:36:25.487
from their home.

323
00:36:26.314 --> 00:36:28.142
Unless we feel
the child is in danger.

324
00:36:29.448 --> 00:36:30.797
Do I look dangerous?

325
00:36:32.581 --> 00:36:34.322
The situation at the party--

326
00:36:34.453 --> 00:36:35.323
Was an accident!

327
00:36:39.806 --> 00:36:42.374
It was-- it was--

328
00:36:47.988 --> 00:36:49.337
It was an accident.

329
00:36:50.773 --> 00:36:52.340
It's never gonna
happen again.

330
00:36:56.779 --> 00:36:57.867
Do you understand
why we're here?

331
00:37:08.965 --> 00:37:11.098
Hey. baby girl. Hey.

332
00:37:24.807 --> 00:37:26.026
It's okay.

333
00:37:26.722 --> 00:37:27.680
Here.

334
00:37:29.856 --> 00:37:31.118
Hey. Bearbear.

335
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.605
I'm sorry.
I messed up.

336
00:37:40.519 --> 00:37:42.390
Everything's gonna
go back to normal.

337
00:37:44.523 --> 00:37:46.264
Will you stop
writing down everything I say?

338
00:37:59.842 --> 00:38:01.104
Come here.

339
00:38:16.468 --> 00:38:18.426
-I love you.
-I love you.

340
00:38:43.625 --> 00:38:44.626
Fuck them. no?

341
00:38:49.457 --> 00:38:51.329
Fuck them for judging us.

342
00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:54.332
You're a good mother.

343
00:38:55.071 --> 00:38:56.203
I just wanna cry.

344
00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:59.424
But nothing's coming out.

345
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:01.339
They don't know shit.

346
00:39:05.386 --> 00:39:06.605
What's wrong with me.
Toaster?

347
00:39:12.654 --> 00:39:14.134
What are you doing. Chama?

348
00:39:15.048 --> 00:39:17.224
You think you got.
like. a choice. really?

349
00:39:18.921 --> 00:39:21.533
A la maquina.dummy.
Not even.

350
00:39:23.535 --> 00:39:24.623
Okay. when we was.
like. born...

351
00:39:25.885 --> 00:39:28.888
let's say God.
yeah. God.

352
00:39:29.323 --> 00:39:30.629
You know. God was like...

353
00:39:33.545 --> 00:39:36.199
"I'm gonna make
this child super smart.

354
00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:37.897
And then this one?

355
00:39:37.984 --> 00:39:39.638
This one is gonna be
dumb as crackers.

356
00:39:39.768 --> 00:39:41.857
And then this one?
Oh. you know what?

357
00:39:41.988 --> 00:39:44.599
That one is gonna get
a fucking mental illness.

358
00:39:44.686 --> 00:39:47.341
hell yeah. because
that'll be fucking fun. no?

359
00:39:47.472 --> 00:39:48.995
And this one.

360
00:39:49.125 --> 00:39:52.999
This one's gonna have ADHD.
hell yeah!

361
00:39:53.129 --> 00:39:54.827
And this one.
just for shits and giggles.

362
00:39:54.914 --> 00:39:57.046
let's give it
leukemia. right?

363
00:39:57.177 --> 00:39:59.832
Because. you know.
life needs more hurdles.

364
00:40:00.528 --> 00:40:02.835
And this one?
Yeah. this one.

365
00:40:02.965 --> 00:40:05.098
This one gets
an addictive personality.

366
00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:07.274
And that one doesn't."

367
00:40:10.973 --> 00:40:12.235
This is us.

368
00:40:15.717 --> 00:40:18.503
We gotta fucking fight
until we win.

369
00:40:20.679 --> 00:40:22.289
We're fucking rebels. no?

370
00:40:24.596 --> 00:40:26.206
And we're gonna
take care of all of it.

371
00:40:29.165 --> 00:40:30.297
Just not today.

372
00:41:13.166 --> 00:41:14.950
I want my baby.

373
00:41:20.869 --> 00:41:23.002
-I want my baby.
-It's okay.

374
00:41:23.611 --> 00:41:26.092
-Shh.
-I want my baby.

375
00:41:26.222 --> 00:41:29.095
Shh. can you just.
like. think it

376
00:41:29.225 --> 00:41:30.879
instead of saying it
out loud?

377
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.751
I want my baby!

378
00:41:32.881 --> 00:41:34.840
And I would like her
to shut the fuck up!

379
00:41:36.537 --> 00:41:37.495
What the fuck you say?

380
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.674
No. it's okay.

381
00:41:43.457 --> 00:41:44.676
You can. like.
say that one more time.

382
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:46.852
Just shut her up.

383
00:41:56.818 --> 00:41:58.516
Do you know what the fuck
my friend has been through?

384
00:42:00.213 --> 00:42:01.823
You want her
to shut the fuck up?

385
00:42:03.172 --> 00:42:04.522
Just go back to your seat.

386
00:42:06.132 --> 00:42:07.525
Go back to my seat?

387
00:42:09.091 --> 00:42:10.789
I'll stand here
if I want to.

388
00:42:16.621 --> 00:42:17.622
You're drunk.

389
00:42:20.015 --> 00:42:21.190
What'd you say?

390
00:42:21.756 --> 00:42:23.541
You fucking stink.
you're drunk.

391
00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.591
Fuck!
Get this crazy bitch off me!

392
00:42:30.722 --> 00:42:31.897
Fuck you!

393
00:42:33.463 --> 00:42:34.552
Fuck!

394
00:42:37.032 --> 00:42:38.817
-Fuck!
-Fuck you!

395
00:42:38.947 --> 00:42:40.166
Look at this place. mija.

396
00:42:40.296 --> 00:42:41.689
That's what you dreamed of.

397
00:42:43.865 --> 00:42:45.737
We can put my mother's
papal cross right here.

398
00:42:45.867 --> 00:42:47.129
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah?

399
00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.391
Mm-hmm.

400
00:42:52.134 --> 00:42:54.920
Maybe. like.
a painting right there?

401
00:42:55.007 --> 00:42:56.182
You could put up two.

402
00:42:56.312 --> 00:42:57.749
What do you think?

403
00:42:58.314 --> 00:42:59.446
What do you think?

404
00:43:04.756 --> 00:43:08.934
Oh. and-- oh. I have
this doll collection

405
00:43:09.064 --> 00:43:10.892
that my mother found
outside a dumpster in the mall.

406
00:43:11.023 --> 00:43:13.460
-Really?
-It's in perfect condition.

407
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:15.070
Well. like. perfect condition
for. like. the dumpster.

408
00:43:15.201 --> 00:43:16.594
but I've always
wanted to display it.

409
00:43:17.943 --> 00:43:18.857
Where you gonna put it up?

410
00:43:20.728 --> 00:43:22.034
What do you think?

411
00:43:24.166 --> 00:43:25.167
Are you happy or what?

412
00:43:45.013 --> 00:43:46.101
I wanted a miracle.

413
00:43:47.712 --> 00:43:48.626
And I got one.

414
00:43:51.106 --> 00:43:52.499
I didn't need anything else.

415
00:44:22.268 --> 00:44:23.922
My husband
was at home with my daughter.

416
00:44:25.924 --> 00:44:27.795
I was at the long bar
with my friends.

417
00:44:30.798 --> 00:44:31.756
Boyfriend.

418
00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:34.976
We were all fucked up.

419
00:44:36.891 --> 00:44:37.979
Breaking vows...

420
00:44:39.807 --> 00:44:40.982
and I fell.

421
00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:43.115
Cracked my fucking tailbone.

422
00:44:45.247 --> 00:44:47.162
I put one of those
blue ice packs on it.

423
00:44:47.946 --> 00:44:48.947
It broke.

424
00:44:50.775 --> 00:44:52.037
Dyed my ass blue.

425
00:44:55.954 --> 00:44:57.999
So. I go home
smelling like turpentine...

426
00:44:59.218 --> 00:45:01.220
with a serious fucking injury.

427
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:02.569
a blue ass...

428
00:45:03.788 --> 00:45:05.267
all the while.

429
00:45:05.354 --> 00:45:06.399
I was just supposed
to be picking up dinner.

430
00:45:09.315 --> 00:45:13.580
♪ Lord take me home.

who finally decided to show up.

442
00:46:25.434 --> 00:46:27.697
I was out looking
for a present for my dad.

443
00:46:27.828 --> 00:46:29.134
I don't know
what to get him.

444
00:46:29.264 --> 00:46:31.049
Maybe another
World War Two book

445
00:46:31.136 --> 00:46:33.007
with the card inside
that says. "Happy birthday.

446
00:46:33.138 --> 00:46:34.530
We got nothing in common."

447
00:46:34.661 --> 00:46:36.794
What?

448
00:46:38.186 --> 00:46:39.927
You know your jacket smells?

449
00:46:40.058 --> 00:46:41.189
You ever wash it?

450
00:46:42.103 --> 00:46:43.583
It's not like
it touches my ass.

451
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:45.150
I'm not. like.
farting in it...

452
00:46:46.412 --> 00:46:47.500
all the time.

453
00:46:49.154 --> 00:46:50.372
Oh. come on.
that was funny.

454
00:46:51.286 --> 00:46:52.722
You know. you really
should laugh more.

455
00:46:52.853 --> 00:46:53.767
Especially here.

456
00:47:07.389 --> 00:47:09.217
Not sure
if I'm supposed to be here.

457
00:47:10.479 --> 00:47:12.264
If you're standing
there. you probably are.

458
00:47:12.394 --> 00:47:13.700
But we don't detox.

459
00:47:15.049 --> 00:47:16.224
I'm clean.

460
00:47:16.703 --> 00:47:17.704
We're full up.

461
00:47:19.271 --> 00:47:20.794
Plus. it's 3:00 PM.

462
00:47:20.925 --> 00:47:22.317
We don't take
anyone past noon.

463
00:47:28.323 --> 00:47:29.934
This is the third place
I've tried today.

464
00:47:32.327 --> 00:47:33.851
What's worse
than being invisible?

465
00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:36.897
Being seen as disposable.

466
00:47:51.129 --> 00:47:52.608
I go to the hospital.

467
00:47:52.739 --> 00:47:55.046
Be responsible.
Get checked.

468
00:47:55.133 --> 00:47:56.134
Dose.

469
00:48:00.181 --> 00:48:01.748
I want to rip off my skin.

470
00:48:04.185 --> 00:48:05.230
The way she looks at me.

471
00:48:08.711 --> 00:48:10.322
Does she need to double up?

472
00:48:11.105 --> 00:48:13.020
The nurse.
The fucking nurse.

473
00:48:14.021 --> 00:48:17.285
I'm dirty. Disgusting.

474
00:48:17.416 --> 00:48:19.418
She doesn't see me.

475
00:48:19.548 --> 00:48:21.942
She'll check my chart.

476
00:48:22.029 --> 00:48:23.074
She'll know what I've done.

477
00:49:34.536 --> 00:49:36.321
I told you last time
I wanted to sell you.

478
00:49:36.451 --> 00:49:37.757
you know what I mean?

479
00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.238
I just didn't like the way
y'all went out like that.

480
00:49:40.368 --> 00:49:41.587
I know you got something.

481
00:49:41.717 --> 00:49:42.980
Nah. not this time.

482
00:49:49.682 --> 00:49:51.249
Fuck you up. Fucking kill you.

483
00:49:52.641 --> 00:49:53.903
This shit ain't over.

484
00:50:00.432 --> 00:50:01.781
Santi. what did you do?

485
00:50:06.177 --> 00:50:07.482
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

486
00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.374
Who's there?

487
00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:02.380
What are you doing. Chama?

488
00:52:04.077 --> 00:52:05.122
Toaster.

489
00:52:09.387 --> 00:52:11.084
You gotta go away.

490
00:52:16.568 --> 00:52:17.482
Go away!

491
00:52:25.707 --> 00:52:26.969
Toaster.

492
00:52:28.275 --> 00:52:30.712
Toaster!

493
00:52:30.843 --> 00:52:31.974
I thought
you wanted me to leave.

494
00:52:35.239 --> 00:52:36.892
No. no.

495
00:52:42.594 --> 00:52:43.638
I'm all alone.

496
00:52:51.298 --> 00:52:53.953
Remember when we first met?

497
00:52:54.083 --> 00:52:56.216
We were working
at some old folks' home

498
00:52:56.347 --> 00:52:57.522
and making food and shit.

499
00:53:00.655 --> 00:53:02.483
Yeah.

500
00:53:02.614 --> 00:53:04.485
We both hated the way
old people were treated.

501
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.054
Like they were a nuisance.

502
00:53:09.751 --> 00:53:11.927
Like they chose
to be old and shit.

503
00:53:12.058 --> 00:53:14.191
You thought I was
like your sister and shit.

504
00:53:14.321 --> 00:53:15.888
You got all mad.

505
00:53:33.035 --> 00:53:34.559
You know what
the worst part is?

506
00:53:35.647 --> 00:53:37.605
All of it.

507
00:53:37.736 --> 00:53:39.216
When you're out. Chama.

508
00:53:42.393 --> 00:53:44.743
You start smoking the crumbs.

509
00:53:44.873 --> 00:53:46.397
I've seen you do it.

510
00:53:46.527 --> 00:53:48.268
You're a dummy.

511
00:53:48.399 --> 00:53:49.748
You smoke the crumbs
and then more.

512
00:53:49.878 --> 00:53:52.968
Then you put Selena
on full blast.

513
00:53:53.055 --> 00:53:57.538
But it's not the same
as when you kiss it.

514
00:53:57.625 --> 00:53:59.236
-Put it in.
-No. shut up!

515
00:54:00.759 --> 00:54:02.108
Open up.

516
00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:04.197
No. No!

517
00:54:06.895 --> 00:54:08.723
I've got
something for you. Chama.

518
00:54:10.334 --> 00:54:11.465
No!

519
00:54:23.608 --> 00:54:25.523
I'll do better.
I'll do better.

520
00:54:25.653 --> 00:54:27.307
I'll do better.
I'll do better.

521
00:54:27.394 --> 00:54:28.569
I promise I'll do better.

522
00:54:31.833 --> 00:54:33.879
You lied. You lied.

523
00:54:44.019 --> 00:54:45.891
No. don't--
don't move. don't move.

524
00:54:45.978 --> 00:54:47.936
Is it cold?
Is it cold down there?

525
00:54:48.067 --> 00:54:51.157
Please hold on to my hand.
Oh. my God.

526
00:54:59.252 --> 00:55:00.166
Toaster.

527
00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.082
Are you fucking with me?

528
00:55:04.083 --> 00:55:05.998
What are you doing. Chama?

529
00:55:06.128 --> 00:55:07.826
Hey.

530
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:12.309
-Don't you?
-No. sorry.

531
00:55:14.398 --> 00:55:15.442
I only got
a couple of bucks.

532
00:55:19.881 --> 00:55:21.492
Come on. Please.

533
00:55:25.452 --> 00:55:27.802
Come on.
Come on. Please.

534
00:55:34.026 --> 00:55:38.335
Come on. Come on.
Come on. please.

535
00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:48.693
I've been talking
to you and not once.

536
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:51.435
through everything.
have you said anything back.

537
00:55:54.438 --> 00:55:55.526
Are you not there?

538
00:55:57.005 --> 00:55:58.355
Can you not hear me?

539
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:41.267
Nine months.

540
00:56:44.705 --> 00:56:45.837
Clean.

541
00:56:50.711 --> 00:56:51.756
Look at your arms.

542
00:56:52.452 --> 00:56:55.368
You're a worthless fucking...

543
00:56:56.804 --> 00:56:57.762
junkie.

544
00:57:00.591 --> 00:57:01.853
Why don't
you just kill yourself?

545
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:12.907
Or you could...

546
00:57:14.735 --> 00:57:15.736
go.

547
00:57:17.085 --> 00:57:18.130
Grab your daughter...

548
00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:21.742
and get out of here.

549
00:57:22.264 --> 00:57:23.614
Get the fuck out of here.

550
00:57:26.791 --> 00:57:27.792
Get the fuck out of here.

551
00:57:30.229 --> 00:57:31.448
Police department.
don't move!

552
00:57:31.535 --> 00:57:32.753
Police department!

553
00:58:05.873 --> 00:58:08.528
You wanna know the...

554
00:58:08.659 --> 00:58:11.662
...two worst words
in the English vocabulary?

555
00:58:14.795 --> 00:58:16.754
What if...

556
00:58:17.842 --> 00:58:19.757
...um. what if...

557
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.630
my dad
was the president?

558
00:58:25.502 --> 00:58:26.503
Or what if...

559
00:58:27.939 --> 00:58:29.375
um. my mom...

560
00:58:30.637 --> 00:58:32.291
actually wanted me?

561
00:58:34.946 --> 00:58:36.382
What if...

562
00:58:37.209 --> 00:58:38.950
I was born in London.

563
00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.212
or...

564
00:58:41.082 --> 00:58:42.388
or Ireland?

565
00:58:45.086 --> 00:58:47.306
Lived on a farm far away?

566
00:58:54.008 --> 00:58:56.141
What if when I ate food

567
00:58:56.228 --> 00:58:57.969
I could keep it down.

568
00:58:58.099 --> 00:59:01.538
like. that wasn't even
a thought. you know?

569
00:59:08.066 --> 00:59:09.328
What if they didn't say...

570
00:59:10.634 --> 00:59:11.548
it was all my fault?

571
00:59:14.638 --> 00:59:15.900
Make up lies about me?

572
00:59:22.776 --> 00:59:24.735
What if he came to get me?

573
00:59:28.216 --> 00:59:29.522
You know where I'm at?

574
00:59:34.483 --> 00:59:36.877
You know. what if
I didn't have to ask what if?

575
01:00:17.744 --> 01:00:18.615

Where are you going. Chama?

618
01:03:06.608 --> 01:03:09.133
When Abuelo died.
I ran away.

619
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:14.965
Which brought me
right back to you.

620
01:03:17.315 --> 01:03:18.925
Do you want them
to think you're loca?

621
01:03:19.012 --> 01:03:20.927
Because that's what
they're gonna say. hm?

622
01:03:21.058 --> 01:03:22.233
Look at that crazy.
going around losing it.

623
01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.463
It's not fair.
I don't want Abuelo to go.

624
01:03:36.203 --> 01:03:37.639
You think anyone cares
about what you want?

625
01:03:41.426 --> 01:03:42.775
Your sister's not gonna
live with us anymore.

626
01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.430
Her father wants her.

627
01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.823
Take her back to Texas
and I'm too fucking tired

628
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:47.780
to keep fighting him.

629
01:03:50.174 --> 01:03:51.828
Just us now.

630
01:03:59.444 --> 01:04:01.315
Don't be mad at what it is
because we're just paying

631
01:04:01.446 --> 01:04:02.534
for something
we did in another life.

632
01:04:04.449 --> 01:04:05.319
Here. drink this.

633
01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.279
Not too much.

634
01:04:08.409 --> 01:04:09.323
Just enough
to make you feel better.

635
01:05:09.166 --> 01:05:10.080
I thought
you looked thirsty. mama.

636
01:05:15.607 --> 01:05:17.304
Chart's looking like
you're eight weeks along.

637
01:05:18.262 --> 01:05:19.785
Someone talk to you
about your options?

638
01:05:23.615 --> 01:05:24.921
It's okay. mama.
take your time.

639
01:05:33.973 --> 01:05:35.148
Thank you.

640
01:05:36.106 --> 01:05:37.063
You think
you gotta keep it yourself.

641
01:05:37.194 --> 01:05:38.760
but you don't.

642
01:05:39.674 --> 01:05:41.198
I don't know what direction you
gonna go with this pregnancy.

643
01:05:41.328 --> 01:05:43.635
but we can help you
safely transition.

644
01:05:43.765 --> 01:05:45.245
Detox that stuff
out your system.

645
01:05:47.117 --> 01:05:48.379
Or you can continue your way.

646
01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:53.166
You got two options here.

647
01:05:53.297 --> 01:05:55.734
First. you leave.
then there's the second one.

648
01:06:03.524 --> 01:06:05.048
I know
I'll see her face again.

649
01:06:11.706 --> 01:06:12.925
The bedpost.

650
01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:15.058
The ceiling.

651
01:06:16.276 --> 01:06:17.147
The mole.

652
01:06:18.235 --> 01:06:19.714
The itch.

653
01:06:19.845 --> 01:06:21.194
Did you hear that?

654
01:06:26.765 --> 01:06:28.462
I know
I'll see her face again.

655
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.122
The bedpost. The ceiling.

656
01:06:37.341 --> 01:06:39.038
The mole. The itch.

657
01:06:51.616 --> 01:06:53.357
I know
I'll see her face again.

658
01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:03.584
The bedpost.
The ceiling. The mole.

659
01:07:03.715 --> 01:07:04.846
You're looking better.

660
01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:10.287
I know
I'll see her face again.

661
01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:11.592
I know
I'll see her face again.

662
01:07:11.723 --> 01:07:13.159
You're looking better.

663
01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:14.682
I know
I'll see her face again.

664
01:07:14.813 --> 01:07:16.119
You're looking better.

665
01:07:16.249 --> 01:07:17.033
I know
I'll see her face again!

666
01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:33.049
First time here?

667
01:07:37.618 --> 01:07:39.794
They think we're all crazy.

668
01:07:39.925 --> 01:07:41.405
Kind of makes me
wanna pop their eye out.

669
01:07:42.841 --> 01:07:45.061
I'm Nell.

670
01:07:49.195 --> 01:07:50.196
Chama.

671
01:07:51.197 --> 01:07:52.198
Like the town.

672
01:07:54.722 --> 01:07:56.072
Chama. New Mexico.

673
01:08:03.296 --> 01:08:05.255
Everything is out to beat us.

674
01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:08.084
but I'm just biding my minutes
'til I get into Guadalupe.

675
01:08:14.133 --> 01:08:15.091
Is this your first time?

676
01:08:16.483 --> 01:08:17.484
Sixth.

677
01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:23.882
See you later.

678
01:08:31.759 --> 01:08:32.586
Bedpost.

679
01:08:36.242 --> 01:08:37.113
Ceiling.

680
01:08:46.687 --> 01:08:48.080
Boredom.

681
01:08:56.697 --> 01:08:57.959
Itch.

682
01:09:01.746 --> 01:09:03.791
Not as sick.

683
01:09:14.367 --> 01:09:15.499
I was
in my Grandma's double-wide

684
01:09:15.586 --> 01:09:16.891
playing with her cat.

685
01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:18.719
Her neighbor
stopped over and asked

686
01:09:18.850 --> 01:09:19.894
if I wanted
to try something.

687
01:09:20.808 --> 01:09:22.593
I was like.
"How does it feel?"

688
01:09:22.723 --> 01:09:24.160
He was like. "Don't be a baby.
Just try it."

689
01:09:26.031 --> 01:09:27.685
So I smoked meth
out of a light bulb.

690
01:09:28.773 --> 01:09:30.166
I was like.
"I don't even feel anything."

691
01:09:31.428 --> 01:09:34.300
Then it was days later

692
01:09:34.431 --> 01:09:36.172
and there was no concept
of where time went.

693
01:09:36.302 --> 01:09:38.913
All I know
is Grandma's cat was dead

694
01:09:39.044 --> 01:09:40.437
and I missed
my 16th birthday.

695
01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:52.492
I was just thinking
how fucking awesome life is.

696
01:09:52.623 --> 01:09:55.452
I know.
We have clothes and groceries.

697
01:09:55.582 --> 01:09:57.236
Mom's not snorting
dust off the carpet

698
01:09:57.367 --> 01:09:59.238
and we have college funds.

699
01:09:59.369 --> 01:10:01.240
I'm so glad you're not
fuck ups like Tina's kids.

700
01:10:01.371 --> 01:10:03.460
They smell like garbage.

701
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:05.288
You're also lucky to have
a house with a working heater.

702
01:10:05.418 --> 01:10:06.724
Do people
live without a heater?

703
01:10:06.811 --> 01:10:08.247
Oh. yes.

704
01:10:08.334 --> 01:10:10.162
Because usually those people

705
01:10:10.249 --> 01:10:12.077
are fucking strangers for coke.

706
01:10:13.644 --> 01:10:15.515
-Hey. Nick.
-Hello.

707
01:10:20.738 --> 01:10:22.043
Bring back a chicharrón?

708
01:10:23.262 --> 01:10:24.220
Huh?

709
01:10:25.482 --> 01:10:27.005
Are you even New Mexican?

710
01:10:28.485 --> 01:10:30.443
Born and raised.

711
01:10:30.574 --> 01:10:31.836
You're as New Mexican
as Taco Bell green chili.

712
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:34.969
There. you see?
You do have jokes.

713
01:10:35.056 --> 01:10:36.536
They're not
necessarily good. but...

714
01:10:57.122 --> 01:11:00.081
♪ I'm gettin' better.
gettin' better all the time ♪

715
01:11:04.521 --> 01:11:06.349
Hey. hey. hold up.

716
01:11:06.479 --> 01:11:07.698
Hold up.
You got a place to go?

717
01:11:09.526 --> 01:11:10.788
Yeah. sure.

718
01:11:11.441 --> 01:11:13.573
There's other
spots you can try.

719
01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:14.966
Yeah. everyone's really rolling
out the red carpet these days.

720
01:11:23.496 --> 01:11:25.455
Francis. don't.

721
01:11:25.803 --> 01:11:27.587
Come on. Francis.

722
01:11:27.718 --> 01:11:29.807
'Cause I ain't got
nothing left!

723
01:11:29.894 --> 01:11:31.809
Please.
will you just go inside?

724
01:11:31.896 --> 01:11:33.114
Francis.

725
01:11:38.511 --> 01:11:39.817
People come and go.

726
01:11:39.947 --> 01:11:41.688
If you want it. you want it.

727
01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:44.735
If you don't.
don't take someone else's bed.

728
01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:47.128
There's a box of donated
clothes in the corner.

729
01:11:53.396 --> 01:11:54.440
Looks like you made it.

730
01:12:21.946 --> 01:12:23.121
Look...

731
01:12:25.558 --> 01:12:26.429
I don't know what I'm doing.

732
01:12:28.648 --> 01:12:29.519
Are you on anything?

733
01:12:31.434 --> 01:12:32.522
No. I'm clean.

734
01:12:35.829 --> 01:12:37.396
Plus. I don't even
got any money.

735
01:12:38.136 --> 01:12:39.355
Has that ever
stopped you before?

736
01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:44.360
Whatever.

737
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:58.678
I'm not gonna fuck you.

738
01:13:03.814 --> 01:13:04.684
I'm sorry.

739
01:13:12.823 --> 01:13:13.911
Why are you here?

740
01:13:14.651 --> 01:13:17.088
Because I need
to get my daughter back.

741
01:13:25.444 --> 01:13:26.663
Because I need to be normal.

742
01:13:30.928 --> 01:13:31.885
You know
what that word means?

743
01:13:33.234 --> 01:13:35.454
The usual. the average.

744
01:13:35.585 --> 01:13:37.543
the typical state
or condition.

745
01:13:39.502 --> 01:13:40.503
What's normal to you?

746
01:13:43.854 --> 01:13:44.724
I don't know.

747
01:13:45.986 --> 01:13:46.857
Think about it.

748
01:13:55.953 --> 01:13:57.911
Two girls
drinking at a party.

749
01:14:01.915 --> 01:14:03.439
One stops
when it's empty.

750
01:14:04.788 --> 01:14:06.572
For the other.
it never ends.

751
01:14:07.965 --> 01:14:09.357
So you want
to be able to drink--

752
01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:10.446
No!

753
01:14:12.099 --> 01:14:13.449
I don't fucking
need this shit.

754
01:14:20.804 --> 01:14:22.849
Look. it don't
have to be easy.

755
01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:25.678
but just. like.
fair. you know?

756
01:14:25.809 --> 01:14:27.680
Nothing in life is fair.

757
01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:28.638
We'll see.

758
01:14:29.987 --> 01:14:31.292
What do you know about it?

759
01:14:34.295 --> 01:14:36.646
I was diagnosed
with cancer when I was 30.

760
01:14:36.776 --> 01:14:38.082
My parents won't talk to me.

761
01:14:38.212 --> 01:14:40.606
My first boyfriend
ended in assault

762
01:14:40.693 --> 01:14:42.521
and my last one
cheated on me.

763
01:14:42.956 --> 01:14:44.610
I would love a drink.

764
01:14:44.697 --> 01:14:46.177
but I haven't had one
in 12 years.

765
01:14:47.221 --> 01:14:49.746
Nothing in life is fair.
nothing is normal.

766
01:14:50.747 --> 01:14:51.965
But there's beauty
if you fight to see it.

767
01:14:57.841 --> 01:15:00.452
You're gay?

768
01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:01.627
That's what
you took away from that?

769
01:15:07.067 --> 01:15:08.504
You know what I did
when I first got sober?

770
01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:11.463
I'm sure
you're gonna tell me.

771
01:15:15.685 --> 01:15:16.816
I wrote
a moment on each of those.

772
01:15:18.905 --> 01:15:20.777
The moments that got me down.
the ones that kept me going.

773
01:15:20.907 --> 01:15:22.300
Everything.
leading up 'til now.

774
01:15:25.651 --> 01:15:26.696
Sounds like
a lot of triggers.

775
01:15:28.132 --> 01:15:29.916
When you're done.

776
01:15:30.047 --> 01:15:31.004
stick 'em on that wall.

777
01:15:47.064 --> 01:15:47.847
What happened
when you were born?

778
01:15:50.241 --> 01:15:51.503
I tried to kill myself.

779
01:15:52.809 --> 01:15:54.201
There you go.

780
01:15:54.288 --> 01:15:55.376
Start from the beginning.

781
01:16:06.213 --> 01:16:08.825
Cord wrapped around my neck.

782
01:16:08.912 --> 01:16:10.522
It was my first struggle.

783
01:16:17.747 --> 01:16:18.661
This world.

784
01:16:20.488 --> 01:16:21.577
School.

785
01:16:21.707 --> 01:16:23.753
I failed.

786
01:16:23.883 --> 01:16:26.582
If I can fix cars
I can fix anything.

787
01:16:30.673 --> 01:16:33.676
My mother's new boyfriend.

788
01:16:33.763 --> 01:16:35.721
My new boyfriend.

789
01:16:35.808 --> 01:16:38.768
He called me beautiful. ugly.

790
01:16:38.898 --> 01:16:40.160
Look at this place. mija.

791
01:16:42.032 --> 01:16:43.381
This is what you dreamed of.

792
01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:44.687
You gave me no fucking choice

793
01:16:44.774 --> 01:16:45.688
and you have to live with it!

794
01:16:45.818 --> 01:16:46.993
You did this. Elena.

795
01:16:47.124 --> 01:16:48.865
Transforming.

796
01:16:49.387 --> 01:16:50.475
Shut your fucking mouth.

797
01:16:51.737 --> 01:16:53.870
Santi. A dealer.

798
01:16:54.958 --> 01:16:56.829
My first kiss.

799
01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.049
Curious.

800
01:17:07.013 --> 01:17:09.712
Play the same
song over and over.

801
01:17:09.842 --> 01:17:11.583
I stuck a needle in my veins.

802
01:17:11.714 --> 01:17:13.629
My sister listened to me.

803
01:17:13.759 --> 01:17:15.587
My sister
wouldn't ask if I came home.

804
01:17:15.718 --> 01:17:17.676
Abuelo used to say

805
01:17:17.763 --> 01:17:18.895
that if you find
a black feather...

806
01:17:20.157 --> 01:17:21.419
it's a warning.

807
01:17:24.901 --> 01:17:26.511
Come on. come on.
we don't have much time.

808
01:17:32.865 --> 01:17:34.171
I love you.

809
01:17:34.301 --> 01:17:36.695
I love you. I love you.

810
01:17:50.927 --> 01:17:52.537
Where are you going. Chama?

811
01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:54.495
You broke it!

812
01:17:57.455 --> 01:17:59.979
I am my mother's
lost sisters.

813
01:18:06.856 --> 01:18:08.466
The dealer.

814
01:18:13.601 --> 01:18:14.559
Scared.

815
01:18:26.397 --> 01:18:27.572
Always felt like home here.

816
01:18:28.747 --> 01:18:31.010
-The river.
-It's dirty.

817
01:18:31.141 --> 01:18:32.533
Half the time
it doesn't even have water.

818
01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:38.322
You find what it is
you were looking for?

819
01:18:38.452 --> 01:18:40.411
-Don't be like that.
-Like what. Chama?

820
01:18:41.325 --> 01:18:42.195
Like your mother?

821
01:18:43.196 --> 01:18:44.023
What else have you got?

822
01:18:53.293 --> 01:18:55.339
Your Abuelo used to say.
"I don't need a watch--

823
01:18:55.469 --> 01:18:56.557
I got the river."

824
01:19:06.089 --> 01:19:06.916
If you leave...

825
01:19:08.569 --> 01:19:10.049
I don't ever
want to see you again.

826
01:19:13.618 --> 01:19:15.228
I wish I would've put
my arms around you.

827
01:19:16.447 --> 01:19:17.448
One last time.

828
01:19:19.406 --> 01:19:22.279
I wish I would have held you.
felt you.

829
01:19:22.409 --> 01:19:24.455
smelled that lipstick.

830
01:19:24.585 --> 01:19:27.066
I wish I would have been home
when they found you.

831
01:19:27.197 --> 01:19:28.894
I hated you.

832
01:19:29.025 --> 01:19:30.940
I blamed you.

833
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:32.637
I skipped your funeral
and Mari hated me.

834
01:19:35.683 --> 01:19:37.903
But I pretend
in that last moment...

835
01:19:39.426 --> 01:19:41.602
you saw something beautiful.

836
01:20:08.368 --> 01:20:09.239
I used to be married.

837
01:20:11.371 --> 01:20:12.938
He's famous.
I can't tell you who it was.

838
01:20:14.461 --> 01:20:15.811
Okay.

839
01:20:17.421 --> 01:20:18.857
I was independent though.

840
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:21.381
Yeah. I loved to work.

841
01:20:21.512 --> 01:20:24.297
I ran five restaurants.

842
01:20:24.384 --> 01:20:27.344
I mean. most people only.
like. oversee one.

843
01:20:27.474 --> 01:20:28.824
Wanna know how many I ran?

844
01:20:30.564 --> 01:20:32.001
-Five?
-Five!

845
01:20:33.176 --> 01:20:35.700
Yeah. they respected me.

846
01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:37.136
You know. like...

847
01:20:38.050 --> 01:20:39.443
I wasn't a bitch
to them or anything

848
01:20:39.573 --> 01:20:41.749
if that's
what you're thinking.

849
01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.838
but I was the boss.

850
01:20:44.404 --> 01:20:45.841
You should see
the way they looked at me

851
01:20:45.971 --> 01:20:46.972
when I walked into a Chili's.

852
01:20:48.582 --> 01:20:50.367
Nell likes to talk.

853
01:20:50.497 --> 01:20:52.586
A lot.

854
01:20:52.717 --> 01:20:55.111
She says she first
tried heroin at age ten.

855
01:20:55.241 --> 01:20:57.330
Given to her by a neighbor.

856
01:20:57.417 --> 01:21:00.725
She told her father.
who went to her and beat her.

857
01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.596
She started cutting
her knuckles in high school.

858
01:21:02.727 --> 01:21:04.816
but her sister found out
and threw away the razors.

859
01:21:07.036 --> 01:21:09.342
All her friends
worked at a local Chili's.

860
01:21:09.473 --> 01:21:11.562
Nell claims she did. too.

861
01:21:11.692 --> 01:21:15.087
She goes on
and on and on about it.

862
01:21:15.218 --> 01:21:17.176
I just want
to scrub a toilet in peace.

863
01:21:17.307 --> 01:21:18.961
Yeah. I don't really
like Chili's.

864
01:21:21.006 --> 01:21:22.312
Oh. you're one of those...

865
01:21:23.487 --> 01:21:24.880
Applebee's motherfuckers?

866
01:21:31.451 --> 01:21:34.280
Anyways I was doing
really well. you know?

867
01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:35.542
My husband was like...

868
01:22:35.428 --> 01:22:37.300
Okay. let's check in.

869
01:22:39.476 --> 01:22:40.781
It's a cloudy day
out there today.

870
01:22:42.392 --> 01:22:43.436
What's that make
everyone think of?

871
01:22:58.451 --> 01:22:59.322
Rain.

872
01:23:01.585 --> 01:23:03.326
Makes me think of my son
playing in the puddles.

873
01:23:05.023 --> 01:23:05.981
Sweaters.

874
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:09.985
I hate t-shirts
and short pants.

875
01:23:15.599 --> 01:23:16.774
How about you. Gata?

876
01:23:18.428 --> 01:23:19.298
Go fuck yourself.

877
01:23:22.345 --> 01:23:23.694
That's what my ma
used to always say.

878
01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.002
Clouds remind me of her.

879
01:23:29.439 --> 01:23:30.309
Every time I'd mess up...

880
01:23:31.615 --> 01:23:33.704
like. when she'd
catch me slipping.

881
01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:36.011
"Great...

882
01:23:37.099 --> 01:23:38.274
go fuck yourself. Gata."

883
01:23:39.666 --> 01:23:41.538
First time I came here.

884
01:23:41.668 --> 01:23:44.367
-Nick suggested that I say--
-Go love yourself.

885
01:23:45.194 --> 01:23:46.847
Yeah. so now...

886
01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:50.025
when I think about my ma...

887
01:23:51.722 --> 01:23:52.853
it's like...

888
01:23:55.334 --> 01:23:56.379
Go love yourself. Gata.

889
01:24:00.296 --> 01:24:01.819
Go love yourself back.

890
01:24:23.449 --> 01:24:24.363
Ow!

891
01:24:34.808 --> 01:24:36.767
Well. I did it.
because I wanted to.

892
01:24:38.029 --> 01:24:38.943
Um...

893
01:24:40.684 --> 01:24:44.079
I climbed out
of the second story window

894
01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:47.386
at my parents' house
and. um. I jumped.

895
01:24:47.517 --> 01:24:50.172
Probably broke.
like. two bones.

896
01:24:51.042 --> 01:24:53.392
But. you know. he was--

897
01:24:54.741 --> 01:24:56.526
he was older. uh...

898
01:24:58.310 --> 01:25:01.096
he liked me. uh.
everyone liked me.

899
01:25:04.925 --> 01:25:07.667
And. um.
I wanted to see him.

900
01:25:08.538 --> 01:25:12.281
So. yeah. we got
a little strung out...

901
01:25:15.501 --> 01:25:16.415
and. uh...

902
01:25:18.983 --> 01:25:20.115
well. I woke up
in a trailer

903
01:25:20.245 --> 01:25:21.986
with four men...

904
01:25:23.727 --> 01:25:24.554
that I didn't know.

905
01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:28.645
I don't even think
they knew my name.

906
01:25:31.648 --> 01:25:34.694
I had to take Clonazepam.
so I wouldn't get seizures.

907
01:25:35.608 --> 01:25:37.262
But one night
after my husband got rough...

908
01:25:38.568 --> 01:25:39.960
I took too many and OD'd.

909
01:25:41.223 --> 01:25:43.225
This spark plug is fried.

910
01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:45.401
I got arrested
in middle school.

911
01:25:47.272 --> 01:25:48.621
Sent to Las Nunes.

912
01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:50.449
He ordered a youth diagnostic.

913
01:25:51.537 --> 01:25:53.235
I spent Christmas in jail.

914
01:25:53.365 --> 01:25:54.453
When I got
out of the hospital...

915
01:25:55.672 --> 01:25:56.629
the doctor...

916
01:25:57.717 --> 01:25:59.458
prescribed me Clonazepam.

917
01:25:59.806 --> 01:26:01.243
But I liked jail.

918
01:26:02.069 --> 01:26:03.288
No one was gonna
molest me there.

919
01:26:05.334 --> 01:26:07.336
People always ask
what's your favorite number.

920
01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:10.034
I always thought
that was a dumbass question.

921
01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:11.992
Favorite color I get...

922
01:26:13.037 --> 01:26:14.473
but it's not like you're gonna
decorate your house

923
01:26:14.604 --> 01:26:15.474
in multiples of seven.

924
01:26:17.302 --> 01:26:18.999
But I'm a survivor of suicide.

925
01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:22.351
I tried to kill myself
eight times.

926
01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.615
I know
I won't live to see nine.

927
01:26:26.746 --> 01:26:28.008
So eight.

928
01:26:28.966 --> 01:26:30.402
That's my favorite.

929
01:26:30.533 --> 01:26:32.491
Okay. Should be good.

930
01:26:36.582 --> 01:26:38.497
Wow. nice.

931
01:26:39.672 --> 01:26:40.586
Thanks.

932
01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.355
I've already been
transferred six times.

933
01:27:10.442 --> 01:27:11.704
Does anyone
actually work there?

934
01:27:14.490 --> 01:27:15.360
Hello?

935
01:27:24.282 --> 01:27:25.240
Coke?

936
01:27:27.938 --> 01:27:29.331
Mostly opiates.

937
01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:34.553
Mm. no.
do you want a Coke?

938
01:27:37.643 --> 01:27:39.384
-Yeah. Sprite.
-Okay.

939
01:28:00.318 --> 01:28:01.450
I never worked at Chili's.

940
01:28:06.542 --> 01:28:07.456
They wouldn't hire me.

941
01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:15.464
Maybe you should have
tried Applebee's.

942
01:29:06.123 --> 01:29:07.777
He was a penguin.
but he was cold all the time.

943
01:29:07.907 --> 01:29:09.431
so he wore a hat

944
01:29:09.561 --> 01:29:11.346
and a little muffler
around his neck.

945
01:29:11.868 --> 01:29:13.348
Nobody?

946
01:29:15.654 --> 01:29:16.786
I don't really know what's
going on with my head.

947
01:29:16.916 --> 01:29:18.962
-I don't know.
-Okay.

948
01:29:19.092 --> 01:29:20.180
All right.
we're starting.

949
01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:23.836
Where's Nell at?

950
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:25.838
She left.

951
01:29:26.796 --> 01:29:27.797
And if she left...

952
01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.551
Please hang up
and try your call again.

953
01:29:46.119 --> 01:29:47.556
I've called CPS
a million times.

954
01:29:47.686 --> 01:29:49.384
and all I get
is the run around.

955
01:29:49.514 --> 01:29:51.211
-They're busy.
-Whose side you on?

956
01:29:54.171 --> 01:29:55.825
They won't even
let me see her. Nick.

957
01:29:55.955 --> 01:29:57.087
I gotta see her.

958
01:29:57.957 --> 01:29:58.871
You will.

959
01:30:15.932 --> 01:30:18.500
Hey. it's me.
Don't hang up.

960
01:30:19.588 --> 01:30:22.155
If you check out.
you come back by 8:00 PM.

961
01:30:22.242 --> 01:30:25.028
If you come back by 8:00 PM.
you take a test.

962
01:30:25.158 --> 01:30:27.465
Anything you bring back
will be searched.

963
01:30:27.596 --> 01:30:29.293
Anything on the list
will be confiscated.

964
01:30:30.163 --> 01:30:31.643
That includes mouthwash.

965
01:30:32.252 --> 01:30:34.385
Don't think
we're not wise on mouthwash.

966
01:31:23.913 --> 01:31:24.783
We're closed.

967
01:31:25.697 --> 01:31:26.611
That's okay.

968
01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:29.832
I don't got any money.

969
01:31:30.963 --> 01:31:32.095
I have somewhere to be.

970
01:31:32.791 --> 01:31:33.879
Can't get
caught up in you right now.

971
01:31:33.966 --> 01:31:35.359
I'm not in any trouble.

972
01:31:36.708 --> 01:31:38.797
Well. you know what I mean.

973
01:31:42.714 --> 01:31:43.976
I heard you've been
checking up on Nevaeh.

974
01:31:46.152 --> 01:31:48.720
Yeah. I understand.

975
01:31:49.765 --> 01:31:51.593
You're incognizant.
you don't give a shit.

976
01:31:52.768 --> 01:31:53.856
I have enough of my own
problems to worry about.

977
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:59.209
I can't be your broken record.

978
01:32:16.095 --> 01:32:17.532
Mari.

979
01:32:26.236 --> 01:32:27.411
I got shoes on.

980
01:32:50.956 --> 01:32:52.436
I keep
thinking about Toaster.

981
01:32:53.698 --> 01:32:54.569
What she told me.

982
01:32:56.353 --> 01:32:58.398
We gotta fight
until we fucking win.

983
01:33:26.165 --> 01:33:27.906
Don't look at me like that.

984
01:33:28.037 --> 01:33:29.386
She's taking a shit.
She'll be--

985
01:33:29.516 --> 01:33:31.344
Where are you taking us Nick?
Disneyland?

986
01:33:31.475 --> 01:33:33.651
Yeah. right. I bet he's gonna
take us to an NA meeting.

987
01:33:33.782 --> 01:33:34.783
Yeah.
I'd be down for that.

988
01:33:34.913 --> 01:33:36.219
Come on.

989
01:33:37.002 --> 01:33:38.177
-Let's go to Splash Mountain.
-Yep. yep!

990
01:33:38.308 --> 01:33:40.005
Come on. Gata.
Smile for me.

991
01:33:40.571 --> 01:33:42.878
Here's your smile. Shorty.

992
01:33:43.008 --> 01:33:44.662
Don't be like that.
Just one. Don't be like that!

993
01:33:44.793 --> 01:33:46.577
All right. Everybody in.

994
01:33:46.708 --> 01:33:47.883
Hey. what about Chama?

995
01:33:48.013 --> 01:33:48.927
Yeah. where's Chama at?

996
01:33:56.152 --> 01:33:57.109
It's fucking
hot in here.

997
01:33:59.808 --> 01:34:00.635
Come on. girl.

998
01:34:04.769 --> 01:34:06.118
I like the sun on my face.

999
01:34:09.948 --> 01:34:12.516
It calms
the pounding in my chest.

1000
01:34:13.952 --> 01:34:15.127
I wonder where we're going.

1001
01:34:18.217 --> 01:34:21.003
If Nick really gets it.

1002
01:34:21.133 --> 01:34:23.135
I told him the truth.

1003
01:34:23.266 --> 01:34:25.660
About the doctor.
That I'm scared.

1004
01:34:37.236 --> 01:34:39.021
The sun feels
bright on my face.

1005
01:35:00.738 --> 01:35:02.609
Take this over Magic Kingdom.

1006
01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:04.524
Damn. this shit's no joke.

1007
01:35:08.311 --> 01:35:09.181
Come on. Lucy.

1008
01:35:48.612 --> 01:35:50.745
There are thousands
of women that can't have kids.

1009
01:35:54.444 --> 01:35:55.750
And God's got jokes.

1010
01:36:00.885 --> 01:36:01.756
You want this baby?

1011
01:36:09.154 --> 01:36:10.765
But I don't deserve
either of them.

1012
01:36:18.337 --> 01:36:20.209
My first boyfriend
ended in assault.

1013
01:36:23.386 --> 01:36:24.474
Yeah. uh...

1014
01:36:27.042 --> 01:36:28.130
I wasn't the victim.

1015
01:36:35.702 --> 01:36:36.660
I was 18.

1016
01:36:37.748 --> 01:36:38.662
High.

1017
01:36:40.882 --> 01:36:42.927
Made a terrible decision.

1018
01:36:43.058 --> 01:36:45.930
ended up hurting the one person
that I truly loved.

1019
01:36:52.371 --> 01:36:54.678
Spent some time locked up.
hating myself.

1020
01:36:56.332 --> 01:36:57.812
Yeah. that never
really goes away.

1021
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:05.428
But if you can turn guilt.

1022
01:37:05.558 --> 01:37:07.082
hate into something else...

1023
01:37:12.478 --> 01:37:14.524
you can do
something for the world

1024
01:37:14.654 --> 01:37:16.918
that's beyond yourself.

1025
01:37:27.363 --> 01:37:28.668
We're at the bottom of a hill.

1026
01:37:30.496 --> 01:37:31.671
Can you climb?

1027
01:39:44.282 --> 01:39:45.153
The 15th.

1028
01:39:47.416 --> 01:39:48.286
Next Friday.

1029
01:39:51.246 --> 01:39:52.334
You'll get to see
your daughter.

1030
01:40:29.588 --> 01:40:31.199
My name isn't really Chama.

1031
01:40:34.506 --> 01:40:37.335
I saw this postcard
once of a mother and daughter

1032
01:40:37.466 --> 01:40:39.468
standing outside
Chama. New Mexico.

1033
01:40:41.383 --> 01:40:43.037
I wanted to live
in that postcard.

1034
01:40:48.172 --> 01:40:49.043
I talk to my mom.

1035
01:40:51.784 --> 01:40:52.872
And tell her things...

1036
01:40:54.265 --> 01:40:55.440
but not in real life...

1037
01:40:56.311 --> 01:40:58.052
because this reality
took her away.

1038
01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:04.580
I talk to her.
because I got to try

1039
01:41:04.710 --> 01:41:06.190
to understand my scars...

1040
01:41:08.279 --> 01:41:09.933
and not just pick at my scabs.

1041
01:41:18.637 --> 01:41:19.899
I've been through
a lot of shit.

1042
01:41:22.641 --> 01:41:24.252
I've put people through...

1043
01:41:25.688 --> 01:41:26.863
a lot more.

1044
01:41:29.735 --> 01:41:30.867
It's not fair.

1045
01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:35.089
But like Nick says...

1046
01:41:37.178 --> 01:41:38.092
"Nothing is fair...

1047
01:41:39.484 --> 01:41:40.355
nothing is normal."

1048
01:41:45.838 --> 01:41:46.926
What have I done?

1049
01:41:50.626 --> 01:41:51.583
What am I doing?

1050
01:41:55.152 --> 01:41:56.240
If I'm not Chama. then...

1051
01:41:59.374 --> 01:42:00.462
who am I?

1052
01:42:15.564 --> 01:42:16.391
I'm an addict.

1053
01:42:21.309 --> 01:42:22.484
I've slept
on the streets. but...

1054
01:42:24.399 --> 01:42:25.487
I'm not homeless.

1055
01:42:29.578 --> 01:42:31.232
I'm terrified.

1056
01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:38.848
We need help.

1057
01:42:41.111 --> 01:42:41.981
I will help.

1058
01:42:53.732 --> 01:42:54.646
I'm here...

1059
01:42:55.821 --> 01:42:56.996
and I will be a mother.

1060
01:42:59.608 --> 01:43:00.435
I am a mother.
