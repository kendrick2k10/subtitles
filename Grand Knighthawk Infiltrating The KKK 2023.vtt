that popped up for me there.

698
00:36:42.235 --> 00:36:43.672
The morning I left my home.

699
00:36:43.739 --> 00:36:46.644
I had to secretly meet
with the FBI.

700
00:36:48.649 --> 00:36:50.151
JASON:
They had outfitted Joe's truck

701
00:36:50.218 --> 00:36:52.222
with numerous microphones.

702
00:36:52.289 --> 00:36:55.394
And Joe. of course. had
a recording device as well.

703
00:37:02.877 --> 00:37:04.480
GEORGE: What would
have happened to Joe

704
00:37:04.548 --> 00:37:06.450
had they discovered the wire?

705
00:37:06.518 --> 00:37:09.423
- On the surface.
you would think they would

706
00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:12.997
probably react emotionally.
violently.

707
00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:15.401
- Would they have killed him?
- I think so.

708
00:37:25.889 --> 00:37:28.729
I showed up
at Charles Newcomb's home.

709
00:37:28.795 --> 00:37:32.904
And I'm thinking. "OK.
I have to hope for the best.

710
00:37:32.971 --> 00:37:35.876
but I have to expect
the worst."

711
00:37:35.943 --> 00:37:39.149
JASON: The general plan
was to case the area

712
00:37:39.216 --> 00:37:43.693
and get intelligence
for a future drive.

713
00:37:43.759 --> 00:37:47.566
What he'd find out is
that Newcomb had other plans.

714
00:37:55.214 --> 00:37:57.419
JASON: Injecting someone
who's not diabetic

715
00:37:57.485 --> 00:37:59.489
with too much insulin
poisons them.

716
00:37:59.557 --> 00:38:01.661
It kills them.

717
00:38:12.917 --> 00:38:15.789
- They were gonna take him out
on the spot using those drugs.

718
00:38:15.856 --> 00:38:18.695
- They also had thought ahead

719
00:38:18.762 --> 00:38:20.666
how to get rid
of all the evidence.

720
00:38:20.732 --> 00:38:21.668
JOE: Yes.

721
00:38:31.353 --> 00:38:33.826
- So the fishing pole
that day that they introduced

722
00:38:33.893 --> 00:38:36.665
was really to set the scene
to make it look like

723
00:38:36.732 --> 00:38:39.102
it was a normal day.
the victim was out fishing.

724
00:38:39.169 --> 00:38:42.275
and then he had had
a medical condition collapse.

725
00:38:42.342 --> 00:38:43.612
and he was face down
in the water.

726
00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:09.430
- So he puts the fishing gear
in the back of my SUV.

727

where some of
the FBI equipment is.

728
00:39:13.137 --> 00:39:16.544
And I'm thinking...
- Don't open that.

729
00:39:18.615 --> 00:39:20.418
JOE: David Moran showed up.

730
00:39:20.484 --> 00:39:23.792
and there was
an exchange of firearms.

731
00:39:33.177 --> 00:39:35.582
I was not able
to inform the FBI

732
00:39:35.649 --> 00:39:40.826
of the intent of these guys
to kill Mr. Williams.

733
00:39:40.893 --> 00:39:44.466
- It's easy to watch TV
and believe the FBI is--

734
00:39:44.534 --> 00:39:46.505
is everywhere
and that they're--

735
00:39:46.572 --> 00:39:48.074

down the street.

736

The reality is
the idea that we can

737
00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:55.623

it's just not feasible.

738

walking on the sidewalks.

their front doors.

as we turn on to the road

749

there was an obvious presence

law enforcement would

757

goes on in the background

tell the informant.

to jump into battle.

pull the gun out at any moment?

- Absolutely.
