[fly buzzing]

5
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:50.008
There is a fly in here.
so I just want to get it. sorry.

6
00:00:50.092 --> 00:00:52.886
because it keeps coming
and I'm. like. trying to ignore it. but…

7
00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:57.015
[Joan Collins] That's very strange
you would say that.

8
00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:58.100
[fly continues buzzing]

9
00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:03.063
There's a very interesting thing
that happened shortly after Jackie died.

10
00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:08.569
There was this little. tiny fruit fly
that was always in front of me.

11
00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:12.155
It would be here.
I would go to the Polo Lounge

12
00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:14.157
in the Beverly Hills Hotel.
it would be there.

13
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:18.120
I'd go to the south of France and
be sitting there and it would be there.

14
00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:23.166
And I said. "Well. this is Jackie coming
to say that she's still there."

15
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.629
[Jennifer] Yes. we've all heard the story.

16
00:01:27.713 --> 00:01:29.131

17
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.301
-I guess Jackie came back as a fly.

23
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.407

<i>…back in the '70s and '80s.</i>

24
00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:00.954
{\an8}[Tracy] <i>I didn't really understand</i>
<i>what it was she was doing.</i>

25
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.958
{\an8}<i>All I knew was that mommy was on TV a lot.</i>

{\an8}-Bye-bye.
-[Rory] <i>…and there was Jackie Collins.</i>

29
00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:21.975
-Jackie Collins.
-[audience cheering. applauding]

30
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.144
[Morton Janklow] There are people
who are wonderful writers.

31
00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:30.651
{\an8}By that I mean people who use
the language beautifully and elegantly.

32
00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:35.572
Which was almost
the direct opposite of Jackie.

33
00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:37.115
Is it exhausting…

34
00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:38.784
-What?
-…doing research for your books?

35
00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:41.703
-No. [laughs]
-[crowd laughing]

36
00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.289
[Morton] It was one of the reasons
she was so successful…

37
00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:50.337
because she could go out there and promote
those books and not be embarrassed.

38
00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:52.673
[soft music playing]

39
00:02:53.632 --> 00:02:56.385
[woman]
<i>Obviously she writes a lot about sex.</i>

40
00:02:56.802 --> 00:03:00.972
[woman] <i>She's putting female</i>
<i>sexuality at the center of the world</i>

41
00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:03.433
<i>and people lost their minds.</i>

42
00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:06.603
[Terry Wogan] Some of the
sexual gymnastics. quite frankly…

43
00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.021
[crowd laughing]

44
00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:12.693
…give middle aged men
like me a terrific inferiority complex.

45
00:03:14.403 --> 00:03:16.613
[woman]<i> She changed</i>
<i>the way women got to have sex.</i>

46
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.450
<i>Women got to be selfish</i>
<i>in bed thanks to Jackie Collins.</i>

My final guest. the world's most
prolific writer of romantic fiction.

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:27.708
-Barbara Cartland.

49
00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.669
[Barbara] We've got to go back
to the family to save the world.

50
00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:31.962
I mean. look at the mess it's in.

51
00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.714
-It's evil really.
-[Jackie] What?

52
00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:37.050
[stutters] The books
that you write. quite frankly.

53
00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:38.969
-[audience laughing]
-[gasps]

54
00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.679
[audience applauding]

55
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.767
[stutters] I think there's a place
for everybody.

56
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.352
I think there's a place
for Barbara's books

57
00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.020
and there’s a place for my books.

58
00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.773
And I would never criticize Barbara
and say they all have to be like yours.

59
00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:53.230
because wouldn't life be dull

60
00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:55.732
-if we all had to do the same thing?
-No. no. I didn't say that either.

61
00:03:55.807 --> 00:03:57.487
-[all laughing]
-My guests. thank you.

62
00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:59.865
[audience applauding]

63
00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:04.327
[Morton] It's always the same
essential story dressed up differently.

64
00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.666
It is about a woman
facing disaster at the beginning.

65
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.503
And no matter
how downbeat and downtrodden

66
00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:18.508
she outsmarts all the tough guys and wins.

67
00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.093
Girls when they leave school.

68
00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:22.471
should be taught
that in life they can do anything.

69
00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:25.348
I really have this strong belief
that women can do anything.

70
00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:27.309
"Girls can do anything."
that was her motto.

71
00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:31.062
-Girls can do anything.
-Girls can do anything.

72
00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:33.899
-Girls can do anything.
-Women can do anything.

73
00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:36.359
As much as she was saying
that to everybody else.

74
00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:39.488
she was consistently saying it to herself.

75
00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.406
[dramatic music playing]

76
00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:46.119
[Tita Cahn] That is what is so
extraordinary about this tale.

77
00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:52.584
What she wrote and who she was
are two different things.

78
00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:56.254

{\an8}Well. hi. I'm so glad to meet you and I…

93
00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:51.476
{\an8}I think it's very exciting
that you came in from London.

94
00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:56.690
and that you're doing really
a record of Jackie Collins.

112
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.221
<i>"And then. she was lost in sensation.</i>

116
00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.864
[music intensifies]

117
00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:34.871
[Tracy] She was very private.

118
00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.667
{\an8}That's a huge persona
that she'd go on interviews.

119
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.671
{\an8}she would present in the same way.
She was very warm. very affectionate.

120
00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:47.092
But she gave very.
very little away about herself.

121
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:52.931
{\an8}I think people devolved a very natural
interest in who is she and what--

122
00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:55.100
{\an8}How she'd come to be this person.

123
00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.311
And that story was never told by her.

124
00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.815
{\an8}[Rory] It turned out
that she really was her own archiver.

125
00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:06.403
{\an8}I mean. she had hung on to sort of every
element of her entire life and career.

126
00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:09.781
Almost every single letter
that she'd ever received.

127
00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:13.451
[Tiffany] Correspondence.
letters with her and Joan. diaries.

128
00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:17.122
{\an8}She kept it obviously for a reason.
I mean. it's incredible.

129
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:20.834
{\an8}but there's a reason
why she kept it all. it's her whole life.

130
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.715
[Tracy] <i>Had she lived longer.</i>
<i>she may well had written</i>

131

<i>that whole story that she had inside her…</i>

132
00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.470
<i>you know. waiting to tell.</i>

133
00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.949
[interviewer] It seems to me
that Jackie had different personas.

134
00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:54.659
{\an8}She did.

135
00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.453
{\an8}[interviewer] Can you tell me
a bit about that?

136
00:08:57.454 --> 00:09:00.915
{\an8}Well. I think Jackie suffered for a while

137
00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.044
of the baby sister syndrome.

138
00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:08.173
-[dramatic music playing]
-You must give the order. your majesty.

139

[Joan] When I starred in movies.

155

{\an8}she cut out every single thing
that was in the papers.

156
00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:08.733
{\an8}pasted them in scrapbooks
and wrote underneath it.

<i>"Wolverhampton Echo.</i>
January. da. da. da."

It's like a marriage. you know.

160
00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:24.082
It doesn't all go along just perfectly
wonderfully all the time.

161
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.044

I'm Morton Janklow. I'm a literary agent.

290
00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:14.654
{\an8}And I was a literary agent
for Jackie Collins for about 22 years.

291
00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:19.033
It was a very simple formula.

292
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:25.915
She would observe things in life.
and then translate them into books.

293
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.211
I could sometimes pick out
the characters in her books

294
00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:32.213
who were based on real life people.

295
00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:35.091
I think to be successful.
you have to write about what you know.

296
00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:38.135
And whether I'm lucky or unlucky enough
to know a lot about Hollywood.

297
00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:40.262
I think it's what I like to write about.

298
00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:41.764
And <i>Hollywood Wives</i> is fiction.

299
00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.517

it is based very much on facts.

We were hoping for good sales.
but the sales were tremendous.

with me wherever I went.

so that I had something plain on the side.

332
00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:58.025
I took out my little gold bag

333

we were bonded. we were close.

we got a phone call

in this author named Jackie Collins.

375
00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:34.431
{\an8}We had no clue who she was.
we were movie publicists.

who really notices
that it was dependent on her hard work.

384
00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:02.668
When she'd written a book.
she would attend marketing meetings.

385
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.880
Most authors don't do that.
They hand in the book and then disappear.

386

Quite difficult.

813

951
01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:15.862
-[Jackie] What is today. Oscar?
-Today is the happiest day of my life.

952
01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:18.740
Twenty-one years ago. I got married.

953
01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.617
[grunts]

954
01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:28.083
[Morton] I used to call Oscar
and I would say. "How are you. Oscar?"

955
01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:32.546
And he would say. "Listen. Mort.
it's 80 degrees. the sun is shining."

956
01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:35.132
"I'm sitting by the pool
in my bathing suit."

957
01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.591
"How-- What could be better?"

958
01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:38.552
[Jackie] Hi. Oscar.

959
01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:42.597
[Rory] <i>They were just such a perfect team</i>
<i>together. they just worked really well.</i>

960
01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:47.185
<i>Lots of laughing and love</i>
<i>and confiding in each other.</i>

961
01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:49.980
[Jackie] Okay. I'm going out in New York.

962
01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:52.566
And we're going to buy some art.
come on. let's go.

963
01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:53.859
[Oscar] Then we can have lunch.

964
01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:56.486
Oh. I might have lunch
at the Four Seasons.

965
01:00:58.572 --> 01:00:59.739
[Rory]<i> He was so proud of her.</i>

966
01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:03.869
<i>He was so proud of who she had become</i>
<i>and how she was managing that success.</i>

967
01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:05.954
[indistinct chatter]

968
01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:09.207
[Joan] He was so important in her life.

969
01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:15.380
He was the family man.
he was her mentor. he was her lover.

970
01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:19.509
[Laura] I would come to the house.
meet them at the house and then go

971
01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:21.595
with them with wherever we were going.

972
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:26.099
And every single time
he would walk to the bottom of the stairs

973
01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:29.728
and she would say. "Okay. I'm ready."
and she would be at the top of the…

974
01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:32.022
…stairs and he would just look at her
and he'd be like.

975
01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:33.607
"You are so beautiful. Look…"

976
01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:36.526
"…how gorgeous your mother looks.
absolutely gorgeous."

977
01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:38.445
-Every…
-…single time.

978
01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:41.198
Whatever she wore. because he adored her.

979
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.618
-[Oscar talking indistinctly]
-Bye. Oscar.

980
01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:46.620
-[laughing]
-[indistinct chatter]

981
01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:49.039
[Oscar] Doesn't she look just beautiful.
my God.

982
01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:53.585
-[soft music playing]
-[insects chirping]

983
01:01:57.297 --> 01:02:00.675
You know. in any family.
there's always going to be

984
01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:03.345
you know. a little bit of nibbling
and so on and…

985
01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:05.055
[scoffs] …so what?

986
01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:09.559
You know. sibling rivalry.
it spurs you on.

987
01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:17.400
I mean. it's very simple.
you know. Joan was a big Hollywood star.

988
01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:20.153
um. and Jackie was a writer.

989
01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:22.530
{\an8}<i>You're finished.</i>
<i>you've lost everything.</i>

990
01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:24.741
{\an8}<i>And I now own this house.</i>

991
01:02:24.824 --> 01:02:29.329
{\an8}<i>-This house. are you insane?</i>
<i>-Oh. no. I'm perfectly sane.</i>

992
01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:35.126
<i>So take this junk and your blonde tramp</i>
<i>and get out of my home.</i>

993
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.878
-[wind blowing]
-[laughing]

994
01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:40.006
She likes to call herself
a female Harold Robbins

995
01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.758
or the Harold Robbins for women.

996
01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:45.262
Some people call her admiringly
the queen of flash and trash

997
01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:48.014
and she joins us this morning. and we're
lucky to have you. Joan Collins. welcome.

998
01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.933
-[Jackie] It's Jackie.
-[host] Jackie…

999
01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:51.726
-[laughs] Joan is…
-[host] Joan was here last week.

1000
01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:52.978
Joan was here last week.

1001
01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:57.774
And then Jackie comes into Hollywood
and becomes the queen of Hollywood.

1002
01:02:58.191 --> 01:02:59.818
Can't be easy for Joan either.

1003
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:03.905
It is often stated that you
and your sister. Joan Collins.

1004
01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:06.241
-the prominent actress from <i>Dynasty…</i>
-Yeah. Right.

1005
01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:07.993
…don't get along and are feuding.

1006
01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:09.619
In fact. we've had it said here
on this program--

1007
01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:12.414
Yeah. I want to talk to you about that.
[laughs]

1008
01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:17.794
-But we're the best of friends.
-I had a couple of relationships.

1009
01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:21.339
a marriage and a long-- And a boyfriend

1010
01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:25.135
that Jackie loathed both of them
and they both loathed her.

1011
01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.220
So it was kind of difficult.

1012
01:03:27.762 --> 01:03:28.805
[indistinct chatter]

1013
01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:33.268
We saw each other.
but it was slightly cool.

1014
01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:42.360
And then. when I got offered
two million dollars to write two books.

1015
01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:44.863
you know. you don't turn that down.

1016
01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:47.782
[Larry] <i>Prime Time.</i>
published by Simon and Schuster.

1017
01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:51.077
Why a novel?
I thought your sister owns fiction.

1018
01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:54.748
Well. yes. she did. but I think
there's possibly room for both of us.

1019
01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.249
I started writing this…

1020
01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:59.836
She would say. "Oh. my sister.
my God. she's looking for something."

1021
01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:01.963
"She's writing a book now.
for God's sake."

1022
01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:04.257
[Larry] How good
a storyteller do you think she is?

1023
01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:07.385
I've no idea. Larry. I'm going to discover
along with everybody else.

1024
01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:10.764
Are you excited about--
How do you feel about that?

1025
01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:12.265
<i>Oh. fine.</i>

1026
01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:19.272
She said.
"How would Joan like it if I got a job in…

1027
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.983
a television series.

1028
01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:25.236
So I think Jackie felt that writing
was her territory.

1029
01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:29.366
it's where she
became successful and made her name.

1030
01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:34.579
And. um.
she worked tirelessly at being Jackie.

1031
01:04:36.414 --> 01:04:40.960
I don't think she ever said. "Well.
not today. I'm too tired." you know.

1032
01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:44.923
They're so different. the two sisters.

1033
01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.927
And don't forget I came
from the fashion world.

1034
01:04:49.427 --> 01:04:51.137
and so I'm accustomed to bitches.

1035
01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:54.224
There's always a certain amount of. um…

1036
01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:58.311
you know. "Maybe you
are stepping on my territory."

1037
01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:00.063
but it's certainly not intentional.

1038
01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:02.565
Joan got a lot of money from non-books.

1039
01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:06.486
There was a big issue as to whether
she'd written and published her own book.

1040
01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:09.739
which I think Jackie
was very secretly happy about.

1041
01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:15.870
So. you know. sisters are sisters.
I mean. siblings are siblings.

1042
01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:19.457
She didn't like it. but I don't think--

1043
01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:22.001
She never used the word "betrayal"
and I'm not sure that's the right word

1044
01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:24.087
and I can't think
of the right word to use.

1045
01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:28.591
She dealt with it the way
that she knew best. you know.

1046
01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:33.847
[Jackie] <i>"Abigail and Primrose were</i>
<i>as unalike as two sisters could be."</i>

1047
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.640
<i>"They couldn't stand each other."</i>

1048
01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:39.561
<i>"Abigail was pushy and grasping.</i>
<i>she loved entertaining and big parties."</i>

1049
01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:41.312
<i>"A true Hollywood princess."</i>

1050
01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.693
<i>"Primrose. the younger</i>
<i>and prettier of the two</i>

1051
01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:49.988
<i>had opted for a different kind of life</i>
<i>where she was able to raise her children</i>

1052
01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:52.532
<i>in what she considered</i>
<i>a more real atmosphere."</i>

1053
01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:55.994
<i>"Who knew that they</i>
<i>were destined to become</i>

1054
01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:58.538
<i>two of the most powerful women</i>

1055
01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:04.627
[Tracy] <i>Whatever she felt in private</i>
<i>she just kept to herself.</i>

1056
01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:11.759
{\an8}<i>Everything that she stood</i>
<i>for was magical and wonderful and sparkly.</i>

1057
01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.847
{\an8}<i>But real life does go on.</i>

1058
01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:24.981
{\an8}[Jackie] And here we have…

1059
01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:29.027
[TV playing indistinctly]

1060
01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:35.074
[Tiffany] We'd been here
about six or seven years

1061
01:06:35.366 --> 01:06:38.703
when our dad
was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

1062
01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:44.125
I think it just came out of nowhere.
I think everybody was sort of shocked

1063
01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:49.589
and. well. they didn't really tell
anybody that he was sick and. um…

1064
01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:52.550
It was just-- It was very sad.
they weren't expecting it.

1065
01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:56.137
It was in the late '80s.
she was at the height of her fame

1066
01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:59.516
and I think it was hard for all of us.

1067
01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:05.355
[Laura] <i>I think in many ways</i>
<i>she didn't know how to cope with it.</i>

1068
01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:12.195
<i>She just thought if she carried on</i>
<i>with her life. it just wasn't there.</i>

1069
01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:15.865
<i>And they decided to build a new home.</i>

1070
01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:17.283
[Jackie] The new house.

1071
01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.579
[Tracy] <i>The whole time</i>
<i>that he was living with cancer.</i>

1072
01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:23.414
<i>he was working on this project.</i>

1073
01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:24.874
-[indistinct chatter]
-[laughing]

1074
01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:27.877
<i>He was very focused</i>
<i>on creating this house.</i>

1075
01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:30.588
<i>He was working with the architects.</i>
<i>he was going to the site.</i>

1076
01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:40.515
[Barbara] <i>He was just so intent on getting</i>
<i>that house finished for Jackie.</i>

1077
01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.475
[somber music playing]

1078
01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:48.982
[Tiffany] The thing is. with my dad.
he didn't want to go anywhere.

1079
01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:51.693
so it was really hard
for him because… [sniffing]

1080
01:07:51.776 --> 01:07:54.445
…he didn't want to leave us
and he didn't want to leave her

1081
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:58.992
and he just didn't want to go anywhere.
so it was just difficult.

1082
01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:00.785
[Oscar] Jackie.
let me take a picture of you.

1083
01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:02.412
[Jackie] No. no. no.

1084
01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:04.163
-Come on. give me the camera.
-[Jackie] No.

1085
01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:09.335
[Tiffany] <i>So they planned out every</i>
<i>element of this home.</i>

1086
01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.798
<i>It was quite beautiful.</i>
<i>it was sort of almost museum-like.</i>

1087
01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.221
<i>That was her fantasy.</i>

1088
01:08:21.306 --> 01:08:24.684
<i>You know. it was like</i>
<i>he had created it for her.</i>

[indistinct chatter]

1090
01:08:28.146 --> 01:08:30.023
<i>It was literally just ready.</i>

1091
01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:34.277
<i>But. you know. there came</i>
<i>a point where he was actually too weak.</i>

1092
01:08:37.614 --> 01:08:39.866

1093
01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:49.584
[birds chirping]

1094
01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:54.714
The phone rang in the morning
and it was Jackie and she said…

1095
01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:58.926
And she was sobbing.
and she said. "Oscar is gone."

1096
01:08:59.594 --> 01:09:01.220
And I started sobbing too.

1097
01:09:06.476 --> 01:09:08.603
[Tracy] <i>She really</i>
<i>didn't deal with it very well.</i>

1098

<i>She only continued</i>
<i>to be the Jackie she created.</i>

1107
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.157
Good morning. Nick.
Good morning. Maryanne.

1108
01:10:04.826 --> 01:10:06.452
[somber music playing]

1109
01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:15.837
[Rory] <i>She had learned</i>
<i>how to survive. and for her…</i>

1110
01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:21.426
<i>what was always there for her.</i>
<i>you know. was Jackie Collins.</i>

1111
01:10:21.509 --> 01:10:23.052
[audience applauding]

1112
01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:26.931
How are you coping with Oscar's death?

1113
01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:29.934
Well. you know.
I think that when somebody dies. you--

1114
01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:32.103
You have your grieving time.

1115
01:10:32.186 --> 01:10:34.856
and then you have
to seize your life again.

1116
01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:36.482
[host] How long does
the grieving time last?

1117
01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:40.111
Everybody is different. you know.
some people will take much longer.

1118
01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:41.904
Is it difficult for you to carry on?

1119
01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:44.615
Well. you know.
when somebody is sick for a long time.

1120
01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:48.119
you learn to accept the inevitable.
You know it's going to happen.

1121
01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:52.373
[Melody] Times were changing
and her books were selling.

1122
01:10:52.623 --> 01:10:56.627
not at the rate of<i> Hollywood Wives.</i>
I can't deny that.

1123
01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:59.130
but they still are out there.

1124
01:11:02.383 --> 01:11:04.802
It's just that we changed as a world.

1125
01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:08.639
Because I knew
I was coming on your program today…

1126
01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:10.892
-[Jackie] Yes.
-…I bought a book yesterday

1127
01:11:10.975 --> 01:11:13.603
and I read the first paragraph

1128
01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:17.273
and I felt I am demeaning myself
reading any further.

1129
01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.483
What book was it?

1130
01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:20.902
This is called. uh. <i>Lovers and Gamblers.</i>

1131
01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:22.779
Now. is that the only one
of mine you've ever read?

1132
01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:25.156
Well. there is one left in my house once

1133
01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:28.117
and I'm afraid
it was put out for the dust.

1134
01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:30.995
The thing that very much worries me
about your books is the sex

1135
01:11:31.078 --> 01:11:32.747
that your strong women are enjoying.

1136
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:35.458
which they're enjoying
on a very kind of passive level.

1137
01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:37.710
They're enjoying
being brutalized and dominated.

1138
01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:40.630
-which is very unlike--
-That absolutely. absolutely ridiculous.

1139
01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:44.467
because as a matter of fact in my books
the woman always comes out on top.

1140
01:11:44.592 --> 01:11:47.470
She did try to change with it. she knew.

1141
01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:50.097
-I have read <i>Hollywood Husbands.</i>
-[Jackie] Yes.

1142
01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:53.392
And the beginning.
the first chapter is disgusting.

1143
01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:57.104
I'm not--
Really disgusting. because it's all…

1144
01:11:57.563 --> 01:12:01.108
She was repeating herself a lot.
as you can see even from her titles.

1145
01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:08.491
And I think the public had had as much
of that information as they wanted.

1146
01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:12.620
The problem is that all of these women
that you portray are tough cookies.

1147
01:12:12.703 --> 01:12:14.455
all right. and they do get somewhere.

1148
01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:18.626
My objection is that they're all also
the most beautiful women in the world.

1149
01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:21.254
[woman] Jackie. you're writing
to a formula. and. I mean.

1150
01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:24.590
there must be loads of people turning out
this kind of formulaic stuff.

1151
01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:28.010
trying to get it published.
But I do think that. sorry…

1152
01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:30.805
You know. I do think
that perhaps your name.

1153
01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:34.433
your Hollywood connections etcetera
must have helped you to get published.

1154
01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:36.310
I'm sorry. I think it's utter bilge.

1155
01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:40.523
I mean. this whole idea about having
positive role models for women

1156
01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:42.066
-I think is total crap.
-[Jackie] Yeah.

1157
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:44.318
-[host] Are you a feminist?
-Yeah. of course I am. yes.

1158
01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:45.945
-[host] She's a feminist?
-Yes. of course I am.

1159
01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:49.949
I wouldn't say
that you're a feminist in any way at all.

1160
01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.701
She's making millions of dollars…

1161
01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:54.161
-[woman] But sex sells.
-…through abuse.

1162
01:12:54.370 --> 01:13:00.334
[Tracy] <i>Her particular brand of. you know.</i>
<i>feminism was a bit behind the times.</i>

1163
01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:05.840
[Melody] The '90s were hard.
and it was kind of mean.

1164
01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:09.802
You took her. you wanted her.
now you don't want her.

1165
01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.015
So she sat down and she wrote.

1166
01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:21.522
But eventually she became completely
confused and lost.

1167
01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:24.734
And it was like she was Lucky.

1168
01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:28.029
She was always Lucky Santangelo.

1169
01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:31.407
And she went on the rides

1170
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:35.786
and the characters took her
on these trips that were crazy.

1171
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:37.788
They were just nuts. some of them.

1172
01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:40.666
But they took her
and that's where she ended up.

1173
01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:44.253
[Jackie] <i>"Lucky was deeply depressed."</i>

1174
01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:49.508
<i>"She took a long drive to the desert</i>
<i>for hours. thinking about it."</i>

1175
01:13:50.801 --> 01:13:52.470
<i>"What was she going to do?"</i>

1176
01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:54.680
[slow music playing]

1177
01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:03.397
<i>And then she started.</i>
<i>quite a lot later. I think.</i>

1178
01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:05.066
<i>going out with Frank.</i>

1179
01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:08.611
-[Jackie] <i>Darling. say something nice.</i>
<i>-I love you. J.</i>

1180
01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:14.116
[Rory] <i>Frank was this kind</i>
<i>of like single guy around town.</i>

1181
01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.953
<i>he'd never been married.</i>
<i>always had lots of girlfriends.</i>

1182
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:21.457
He was one of those guys that was always
smoking cigars and playing cards

1183
01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:25.711
with the boys and taking bets
and he basically did what he liked.

1184
01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:30.299
I knew him through relationships
with James Mason's daughter.

1185
01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:35.554
with Joanna Carson.
many different. uh. "girlfriends".

1186
01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:39.308
He was not exactly a gigolo.

1187
01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:45.022
[Jackie] <i>"With great care.</i>
<i>he pushed her down onto the couch."</i>

<i>"'Get your clothes off. I mean now.'"</i>

1189
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:54.407
[interviewer] So what was it about Frank
that Jackie was so attracted to?

1190
01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:57.493
Beats me.

1191
01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:00.746
[Jackie] Darling.
would you wait on me hand and foot?

1192
01:15:00.955 --> 01:15:02.164
Absolutely not.

1193
01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:04.250
[Rory] It was a time
when our lives were really moving on.

1194
01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:05.876
so we were distracted.

1195
01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.713
And. you known. he was like a character
from one of her books.

1196
01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:12.107
He kind of. you know.
came in and was like a character

1197
01:15:12.188 --> 01:15:13.701
-from one of her books.
-From one of her books

1198
01:15:13.832 --> 01:15:15.052
Literally had sort of stepped out of…

1199
01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:16.095
[all] One of her books.

1200
01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:22.184

-[Jackie] Good.

1207

{\an8}It's a beautiful day
in Albany this morning.

1208
01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:43.956
And I just arrived
and everyone is having breakfast.

1209
01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:45.916
And I love you. darling.

1210
01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:47.835
I wanted her to be with somebody else.

1211
01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:50.046
I didn't necessarily want her
to be with Frank.

1212
01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:53.007
You know. he was nice.
he was very charming.

1213
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:56.510
but I didn't like him.

1214
01:15:56.969 --> 01:16:02.933
And he was the first man that I'd seen her
be with or involved with who I felt…

1215
01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:08.064
you know. didn't feel wholly comfortable
with her success.

1216
01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:09.398
[indistinct chatter]

1217
01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:21.243
[sighs] You want me
to answer what was Frank like.

1218
01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:24.580
-Isn't that what you want?
-[interviewer] Yes.

-[birds singing]
-[wind blowing]

1220
01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:36.342
Well. he was a gambler. a drugger.
an alcoholic. and an abuser.

1221
01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:40.054
That pretty much tells you.

1222
01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:41.430
[Jackie] All right. darlings.

1223
01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:45.101
Here we are at the wonderful.
beautiful Colombe d'Or

1224
01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:49.021
-and we're having a wonderful time.
-[Jackie] Okay. Frank. cut to the chase.

1225
01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:51.065
-[all laughing]
-What else do you want me to say?

1226
01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:53.567
-Come on. Slowly. slowly.
-[Jackie] Oh. slowly. I'm sorry.

1227
01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:58.072
If Frank felt slighted in any way.
he would just…

1228
01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:00.491
go berserk.

[music playing over stereo]

1230

This out of control rage.

1231
01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:07.832
And with it all.
he could be quite charming.

1232
01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:10.626
That's always the trap. isn't it?

1233
01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:17.174
There was a tremendous amount
of shouting and he did become.

1234
01:17:17.383 --> 01:17:19.426
um. extremely controlling.

1235
01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:21.303
Jackelina.

1236
01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:25.683
[Joan] He would lash out
at her in a furious temper.

1237
01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:31.689
And she put up with it because.
I think. maybe she felt guilty?

1238
01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:34.984
Why does one put up with anything.
you know. women put up with a lot.

1239
01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:36.652
[Jackie] Okay.

1240
01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:39.488
[humming] Tell me if I walk into the sea.

1241
01:17:39.572 --> 01:17:42.116
Jackie. you're about ready
to walk into the ocean.

1242

[Jackie] Did we have a nice dinner?

1243
01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:53.419
That this woman who wrote about power
and strength and strong women

1244
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:55.754
could get involved with this man.

1245
01:17:56.380 --> 01:18:01.218
it's very difficult for people
who love Jackie to watch this.

1246
01:18:01.302 --> 01:18:03.470
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Frank] Okay. we're recording.

01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:07.808
-[Tita] <i>I mean. I just don't get it.</i>
-[Frank] Jackie. all right. say something.

1248
01:18:08.142 --> 01:18:11.937
This is Kir Royale. we're in the south
of France. we are at the…

1249
01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:14.607
-We have made pests of ourselves already.
-[Frank laughing]

Roger. you’re terrific.

1255

But. you know you can be 60 or 70.
and still fall for somebody.

1256
01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:38.130
because somehow you think
you're going to maybe replicate something

1257
01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:41.800
that happened in your early years
and get a different outcome.

That's when the tides turned
that he was mad at-- It was everybody.

1261
01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:01.987

that was a particularly tough time.

[Tita] He was furious that she
was writing books while he was ill.

1268
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.595
She would write in her dressing room
in the middle of the night.

1269
01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:29.098
She would get up
when Frank was asleep

1270
01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.434
and she would write
when he didn't know about it.

[distant siren wailing]

1272
01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:39.817
We asked Jackie.
"Were there guns in the house?"

1273
01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.821
And Jackie said. "Yes.
there had been. but they'd been moved."

1274
01:19:44.071 --> 01:19:46.365
Well. that's not comforting.

1275
01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:49.910
[interviewer] And why
were you worried about guns?

1276
01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:52.079
[Tita] Well. obviously why.

1277
01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:56.208
I mean. why are you afraid
of guns being around?

1278
01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:58.168
You're afraid someone might use them.

1279
01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:04.008
I mean. afraid he'd say. "Well.
if I'm going. you're going with me."

1280
01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:06.135
She lives
in her fantasy house in Beverly Hills

1281
01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:09.346
and has sold more
than 200 million books worldwide.

1282
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:11.598
But Jackie Collins told our Mark Steines.

1283
01:20:11.682 --> 01:20:15.394
that the success means nothing
when compared to the love she lost.

[Jennifer] I worked
with Jackie starting in 2008.

1293
01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:12.159
She had made it very clear to me

1294
01:21:12.242 --> 01:21:14.912
that she never wanted
to get married again.

1295
01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:19.917
She didn't want to pick socks off
of her bedroom floor anymore for anyone.

1296

Or do laundry. or cook. She was done.

1297
01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:24.755
She was fine if someone
who wanted to come over

1298
01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:28.801
and spend the night and then leave.
And that's really where she was at.

She was the boss.

1304
01:21:49.488 --> 01:21:52.199
[Tiffany] She immersed herself
in her work as ever.

1305
01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:57.746
But at that point. she'd been
experiencing this foot pain

1306
01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:01.708
and was having a lot of trouble walking.
like she could not walk.

1307
01:22:02.042 --> 01:22:03.585
And I kept on saying to her.

1308
01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:06.422
"We've got to get you to the doctor.
can we please go to the doctor?"

1309
01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:08.882
She said. "Yes.
I'll go next week. I'll go next week."

1310
01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:11.051
Tiff started saying.
"I've got to try and." you know.

1313

And she eventually agreed.

1314
01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:19.643
And my mother is sitting next to me.
and I will never forget this.

1315
01:22:19.726 --> 01:22:23.063
I mean. she looked like
a teenager that had been caught.

1316
01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:27.317
She was like. "Tiffany.
you're going to be so mad at me."

1317
01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:29.987
and I looked at her and I said.
"What? What?"

1318
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:32.948
And she goes. "I've got a lump."

1319
01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:37.244
I said. "Where?"
And she goes. "In my breast."

1320
01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:42.416
And I just remember.
like. my whole world. like. crashing.

1321
01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:44.960
So she'd had a lump and we don't know.

1322
01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:48.338
She says two years and I don't know
if it was longer than that or not.

1323
01:22:48.422 --> 01:22:51.967
but she just hadn't. you know. she just…

1324
01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:55.596
She thought
that she could defy it somehow or another.

1325
01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:57.389
and until it caught up with her.

1326
01:22:57.848 --> 01:23:01.852
So it was. you know. it was just…

1327
01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.856

[Tracy] Because of her past experiences…

1338
01:23:49.399 --> 01:23:52.069
there was that bit
of her that transcended

1339
01:23:53.654 --> 01:23:56.198
what she may have been concerned about.

1340
01:23:57.407 --> 01:23:59.701
You know.
things had been so tough before this.

1341

And I think her.
sort of. traumatic experiences

1342

kept coming back in to play.

I love you.

1344
01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:17.594
[Tracy] She sort of couldn't write it out.
so she could just say.

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:21.181
"Right. I'm going to be fabulous.
I'm going to live my life."

1346
01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:24.059
"I don't really want to know
if there's anything wrong with me."

1347
01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:38.949
So. yes. she was vulnerable. um…

but very much like
her spirit animal of being a cat…

1349

to say goodbye to everybody.

In her mind. that was taking
Jackie Collins out for the last time.

1422
01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:28.655
[laughing]

1423
01:29:28.738 --> 01:29:31.241
-[woman 1] That's why I love your books.
-[woman 2] The thing is. I know.

1424
01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:33.410
[woman 3] Talking about the book.
see. I know that you're very good

1425
01:29:33.493 --> 01:29:35.537
-in your research. very meticulous.
-[Jackie] Yes.

1426
01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:38.248
So I need to know. did you check out
all those sexual positions

1427
01:29:38.331 --> 01:29:40.250
-before you wrote the books?
-Absolutely. every one.

1428
01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:42.335
-that's why I'm exhausted.
-[women laughing]

1429
01:29:43.253 --> 01:29:44.504
[somber music playing]

1430
01:29:49.342 --> 01:29:52.846
You know. Jackie. she lived for her work
and she was still working.

1431
01:29:52.929 --> 01:29:56.224
She was doing talk shows
and she was doing what she loved doing.

1432
01:29:56.433 --> 01:29:59.227
So she did what she loved
doing right up to

1433
01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:01.187
the last moment that she possibly could.

1434
01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:05.150
I wrote a book called <i>Rockstar.</i>
and this rockstar told me the real story…

1435
01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:06.818
"This is how I want to be remembered."

1436
01:30:08.987 --> 01:30:11.656
She knew she was going
to pass shortly after that.

1437
01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:14.492
Yeah. And I try to write erotic sex
and humorous sex.

1438
01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:16.328
-[woman] Exactly.
-And great sex.

1439
01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:19.164
I mean. Lucky in the new book.
she has tantric sex.

1440
01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:21.708
[Laura] So all the last pictures of her…

1441
01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:22.959
[heartbeat]

1442
01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:26.546
…her working and promoting a book.

1443
01:30:29.466 --> 01:30:30.926

1447
01:30:41.603 --> 01:30:44.439
[Bill] <i>And off she went</i>
<i>to America with Laura.</i>

1448
01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:52.238
[Barbara] I never knew she was sick.

1449
01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:57.202
And you know what.
I think that was strong…

1450
01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:03.667
and she showed strength
in women and within her.

1451
01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:08.463
It's amazing how much her mind.
that how she could control things

1452
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:13.259
and how she was so strong mentally
to deal with it the way

1453
01:31:13.343 --> 01:31:16.262
that. you know. she dealt with it. sorry.
[crying]

1454
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:21.184
It was pretty spectacular.
because she just--

1455
01:31:21.267 --> 01:31:23.895
She got to do everything she wanted to do

1456
01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:28.608
and it was like she knew what was going
to happen when she got home.

1457
01:31:28.733 --> 01:31:31.903
It was like she wrote her ending.
that's what it felt like.

1458
01:31:31.987 --> 01:31:33.321
It was like she wrote her ending.

1459
01:31:35.281 --> 01:31:37.492
[somber music playing]

1460
01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:44.874
[Joan] I was in the south of France then…

1461
01:31:46.042 --> 01:31:48.420
and my cellphone beeped

1462
01:31:49.421 --> 01:31:51.381
and I turned it on.

1463
01:31:52.215 --> 01:31:54.968
And they said. "She's passed."

1464
01:31:57.095 --> 01:31:59.305
I cried everyday for three months.

1465
01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:03.810
I missed her.
I have pictures of her still all over.

1466
01:32:06.813 --> 01:32:09.149
We were so
on the same wavelength with. like.

1467
01:32:09.482 --> 01:32:12.652
things that happened.
with seeing movies or with gossip.

1468
01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:16.948
My sister was amazing.

1469
01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:20.994
She had an incredible life.

1470
01:32:23.079 --> 01:32:27.375
And of course. you know.
it was pretty shattering when she died.

1471
01:32:27.459 --> 01:32:33.465
because she was the rock
that kept our family together.

1472

1479

She was Jackie Collins.
and then she was gone.

["Le Fleurs" playing]

1489
01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:02.137
If you only did a documentary

1490

showing her what she was
showing to everybody. who cares?

1491
01:34:06.558 --> 01:34:07.767
Frankly. who cares?

1492
01:34:08.143 --> 01:34:12.689
The only upside of being old
is that you don't give a damn.

we're back full circle now with.

you know. women saying actually
to be women we can be whatever we want.

1498

We can be really openly sexual if we want.

what would Jackie Collins do?

What I learned
from her is that I can do anything.

1503
01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:47.891
And I can speak my mind.
And I don't have to hide behind somebody.

1504
01:34:48.641 --> 01:34:55.315
She loved success in women.
She was very iconic in that way.
