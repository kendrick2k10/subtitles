<i>I'll never forget
The summer I was eight years old.</i>

17
00:02:12.462 --> 00:02:16.298
<i>It was a summer of tea parties
and sword fights.</i>

18
00:02:18.234 --> 00:02:22.739
<i>Of longing to grow up
and fearing to grow old.</i>

19
00:02:22.773 --> 00:02:25.809
<i>Of wishing things
could stay the same forever.</i>

20
00:02:30.346 --> 00:02:33.315
<i>That was the summer
we found the boat.</i>

21
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:37.788
I scalp rodent enemy.

22
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:40.222
I avenge brave chief.

23
00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:42.459
- Let him go.
- Try and make me.

24
00:02:43.794 --> 00:02:45.462
I'll get you!

25
00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:46.897
Tiger Lily. come on.

26
00:02:47.998 --> 00:02:49.533
Wait for me!

27
00:03:03.847 --> 00:03:05.982
I am Pan.
God of the woodlands.

28
00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:07.818
and these are my woods.

29
00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:09.453
You're no Pan.

30
00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:17.928
Take that!

31
00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:20.664
Surrender
the Indian princess now.

32
00:03:20.697 --> 00:03:24.034
or say goodbye to the hostage.
Chief Witchataw.

33
00:03:24.067 --> 00:03:25.602
Never!

34
00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.490
Oh!

35
00:03:50.427 --> 00:03:51.393
I'll get it.

36
00:03:51.428 --> 00:03:54.030
Mama said we're not supposed
to go over the wall.

37
00:03:54.064 --> 00:03:57.567
Blimey.
Come and take a look at this.

38
00:04:10.346 --> 00:04:11.948
Who do you think it belongs to?

39
00:04:12.916 --> 00:04:14.451
Finders keepers.

40
00:04:15.118 --> 00:04:16.653
It's ours now.

41
00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:23.994
She just needs
a bit of fixing up.

42
00:04:24.027 --> 00:04:27.363
Just imagine.
The three of us. mateys at sea.

43
00:04:27.396 --> 00:04:30.700
Braving the elements to discover
uncharted territories.

44
00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:37.841
Where to next. Captain?

45
00:04:37.874 --> 00:04:40.577
But. David.
what if we get lost?

46
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.679
Well. that's the whole point.
isn't it?

47
00:04:42.712 --> 00:04:46.817
We'll be the Lost Boys
of the wild. And girls.

48
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.421
Peter. I almost forgot.
I found this in the woods.

49
00:04:51.454 --> 00:04:55.391
Do you reckon it's special?
To the Indians?

50
00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:56.760
It's an eagle feather.

51
00:05:01.131 --> 00:05:02.599
I'd better wash up.

52
00:05:44.574 --> 00:05:48.612
Hurry along. you two.
Did you not see the time?

53
00:05:48.645 --> 00:05:50.914
Oh dear. oh dear.
I shall be too late.

54
00:05:50.947 --> 00:05:54.985
Hush. don't tease him.
He almost lost his scalp today.

55
00:05:55.018 --> 00:05:58.955
Would you ever get a move on?
Go on. get in with you.

56
00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:02.826
Did you forget your Aunt
Eleanor's coming for dinner?

57
00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:04.961
Oh. you'll be the death of me.
the pair of you.

58
00:06:04.995 --> 00:06:06.096
Mmm.

59
00:06:07.831 --> 00:06:09.699
Who are these dirty vagabonds

60
00:06:09.733 --> 00:06:12.669
and what have they done
with my children?

61
00:06:12.702 --> 00:06:15.105
- Where's Peter?
- He went to speak with Father.

62
00:06:15.138 --> 00:06:17.974
Upstairs. both of you.

63
00:06:18.008 --> 00:06:19.876
Yes. but this one I keep.

64
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.444
- Get yourselves cleaned up.
- Come. talk to me.

65
00:06:21.478 --> 00:06:22.846
I have something for you.

66
00:06:25.782 --> 00:06:29.152
The tinker was in this morning.
mending the pots.

67
00:06:29.185 --> 00:06:32.923
and when he was done. he found
he had some extra copper.

68
00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:37.527
and with it he agreed
to fashion you a small present.

69
00:06:38.228 --> 00:06:39.796
Would you like to see it?

70
00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:47.504
- It's just a bell.
- Oh!

71
00:06:47.537 --> 00:06:49.906
She didn't mean it. I promise.

72
00:06:51.241 --> 00:06:52.776
No. no. it's alright.

73
00:07:15.165 --> 00:07:16.967
- Let me guess.
- Oh!

74
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.002
- Peter.
- <i>The Golden Hind?</i>

75
00:07:19.736 --> 00:07:22.272
You gave me a fright.

76
00:07:22.305 --> 00:07:25.976
It's not suppertime
already. is it?

77
00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:29.946
- Is it for old Mr. Brown?
- Right you are.

78
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.215
<i>The Golden Hind.</i>

79
00:07:32.248 --> 00:07:38.722
The first ship to sail
all the way around the globe.

80
00:07:38.755 --> 00:07:43.727
Imagine what it must be like
to see the whole world.

81
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.564
To sail the Indian Ocean
and the Pacific

82
00:07:47.597 --> 00:07:51.735
and maybe even discover
new lands.

83
00:07:53.136 --> 00:07:56.740
Ah... The things
she must have seen.

84
00:07:59.609 --> 00:08:02.212
When the first baby laughed...

85
00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:04.014
...for the first time.

86
00:08:04.047 --> 00:08:08.118
its laugh broke
into a thousand pieces

87
00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:10.954
and they all went
skipping about.

88
00:08:12.222 --> 00:08:17.627
and that was the beginning
of the fairies.

89
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.098
You see. fairies are far
too magical for the human eye.

90
00:08:22.132 --> 00:08:28.071
So when we look at them.
they take the form of bells.

91
00:08:28.104 --> 00:08:32.842
Every child has a fairy
born just for them.

92
00:08:34.144 --> 00:08:36.679
And this...

93
00:08:36.713 --> 00:08:39.082
...tinker's bell
was born for you.

94
00:08:47.223 --> 00:08:51.061
Tinker Bell.
It's wonderful to meet you.

95
00:08:58.168 --> 00:08:59.335
What's this?

96
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.308
"Dear Mr. Littleton.

97
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:06.943
"it is my duty to inform you

98
00:09:06.976 --> 00:09:09.813
"that your son Peter
is currently failing...

99
00:09:11.415 --> 00:09:13.083
"All his subjects."

100
00:09:14.717 --> 00:09:16.886
- Peter.
- I know what she thinks.

101
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.656
I may not be David.
but I'm not a duffer.

102
00:09:19.689 --> 00:09:23.093
Peter. who said anything
about David?

103
00:09:23.126 --> 00:09:24.961
If you were a duffer.
would you be able to recite

104
00:09:24.994 --> 00:09:26.963
a complete index
of British naval vessels

105
00:09:26.996 --> 00:09:29.199
from the last decade
in under five minutes?

106
00:09:29.232 --> 00:09:31.234
Would you be able to construct

107
00:09:31.267 --> 00:09:35.839
a fully functioning
model galleon in a bottle?

108
00:09:35.872 --> 00:09:37.907
Unlike your siblings.
I might add.

109
00:09:38.808 --> 00:09:40.043
Eh?

110
00:09:40.076 --> 00:09:41.344
I'm not in trouble. then?

111
00:09:42.912 --> 00:09:44.214
Of course you're in trouble.

112
00:09:50.186 --> 00:09:55.358
Look. you've got to try. Peter.

113
00:09:57.894 --> 00:09:59.129
For me?

114
00:10:04.134 --> 00:10:05.402
Come here.

115
00:10:38.402 --> 00:10:40.236
Careful. darling.

116
00:10:46.142 --> 00:10:47.377
Last one.

117
00:10:48.845 --> 00:10:50.313
Beware of the queen of hearts.

118
00:10:59.756 --> 00:11:01.090
Easy does it.

119
00:11:04.894 --> 00:11:06.463
Well done.

120
00:11:06.497 --> 00:11:08.965
- Bravo.
- Bravo. Come on. darling.

121
00:11:08.998 --> 00:11:10.833
Let's keep going.

122
00:11:10.867 --> 00:11:14.804
This silly game has become
something of a family sport.

123
00:11:14.837 --> 00:11:15.972
Our record is four decks.

124
00:11:16.005 --> 00:11:19.242
but Jack thinks
we can do it in five.

125
00:11:19.275 --> 00:11:22.178
You know. I'm...
I'm slightly shocked.

126
00:11:22.212 --> 00:11:25.482
you allow him to have cards
in the house at all.

127
00:11:31.387 --> 00:11:35.124
Red Queen captures White Queen.

128
00:11:38.294 --> 00:11:40.464
- Alice. Jack.
- Coming!

129
00:11:40.497 --> 00:11:43.032
All right. almost done.
almost done.

130
00:11:43.066 --> 00:11:44.200
All right.

131
00:11:49.473 --> 00:11:50.907
There you are.

132
00:11:56.012 --> 00:11:58.781
Mmm. Don't you look handsome.

133
00:12:03.353 --> 00:12:08.958
Not nearly as handsome
as you are beautiful. my queen.

134
00:12:22.138 --> 00:12:23.039
Mmm.

135
00:12:23.072 --> 00:12:26.276
My sis... My sister
is in the other room...

136
00:12:26.309 --> 00:12:27.977
My sister's in the other room.

137
00:12:31.114 --> 00:12:32.882
Rose?

138
00:12:39.188 --> 00:12:41.525
- Oh. yeah.
- She's in rare form tonight.

139
00:12:41.558 --> 00:12:43.159
Uh-oh.

140
00:12:53.404 --> 00:12:57.441
David. What do you think
about dancing lessons?

141
00:12:57.474 --> 00:13:01.210
One must have lessons if one
hopes to ever attend a ball.

142
00:13:01.244 --> 00:13:05.248
I don't think that's quite where
David's interests lie. Eleanor.

143
00:13:06.883 --> 00:13:08.851
Mama. I wanted to ask if you...

144
00:13:08.885 --> 00:13:11.622
Alice.
Speak when you're spoken to.

145
00:13:11.655 --> 00:13:14.390
Really. child.

146
00:13:15.325 --> 00:13:18.928
But if everybody
obeyed that rule

147
00:13:18.961 --> 00:13:22.298
and you only spoke
when you were spoken to.

148
00:13:22.332 --> 00:13:25.134
and the other person
always waited for you to begin.

149
00:13:25.168 --> 00:13:28.338
nobody would ever say anything.

150
00:13:28.371 --> 00:13:30.541
The Red Queen
does not tolerate disobedience.

151
00:13:30.574 --> 00:13:32.241
Off with your head.

152
00:13:32.275 --> 00:13:34.877
Alice. what was it
you wanted to ask?

153
00:13:34.911 --> 00:13:38.114
A pardon
from the White Queen.

154
00:13:38.147 --> 00:13:40.617
I wondered if you might help me
with a sewing project.

155
00:13:40.651 --> 00:13:45.221
Ah. now. good girl. Sewing is
very becoming to a young lady.

156
00:13:45.254 --> 00:13:47.624
I need to mend
my white rabbit's waistcoat.

157
00:13:47.658 --> 00:13:49.092
It was torn this afternoon

158
00:13:49.125 --> 00:13:51.495
when he was taken hostage
by Indian warriors.

159
00:13:51.528 --> 00:13:54.397
Hmm. Poor thing.
Of course I'll help you.

160
00:13:55.398 --> 00:13:56.633
Good heavens. Rose.

161
00:13:56.667 --> 00:13:58.968
the girl's fingernails
are gnawed to the quick.

162
00:13:59.001 --> 00:14:01.304
and what's left of them
is black with dirt.

163
00:14:01.337 --> 00:14:03.607
She was
playing outside. Ellie.

164
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.610
- It's what children do.
- No. it's what boys do.

165
00:14:06.643 --> 00:14:09.680
It's quite a different matter
with girls.

166
00:14:09.713 --> 00:14:13.249
For heaven's sake. this is not
a way to raise a daughter.

167
00:14:13.282 --> 00:14:16.119
Which you would know from your wealth
of experience raising children?

168
00:14:23.993 --> 00:14:25.027
It's brilliant.

169
00:14:25.061 --> 00:14:27.296
Well. children.
I have some very exciting news.

170
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:28.965
- David has been...
- No...

171
00:14:28.998 --> 00:14:33.670
David has been accepted
to Bristlemoss School.

172
00:14:33.704 --> 00:14:37.206
He starts the new term
in a month's time.

173
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.509
Bristlemoss School?

174
00:14:38.542 --> 00:14:40.209
Does that mean
you're moving away?

175
00:14:40.243 --> 00:14:42.613
Now. children. let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

176
00:14:42.646 --> 00:14:46.015
Your aunt really shouldn't have
told you about this

177
00:14:46.048 --> 00:14:48.084
before discussing it
with your mother and me.

178
00:14:48.117 --> 00:14:51.254
There's quite a few details
yet to iron out.

179
00:14:51.287 --> 00:14:54.357
No. I have discussed it.
with Rose.

180
00:14:56.025 --> 00:14:58.995
I was going to speak to you.
I just haven't had the chance.

181
00:15:05.368 --> 00:15:07.738
William and I
will fund David's tuition.

182
00:15:07.771 --> 00:15:10.106
Everything has been arranged.

183
00:15:13.075 --> 00:15:15.412
You agreed to this?

184
00:15:15.446 --> 00:15:18.582
I don't see why we must
make things harder on ourselves.

185
00:15:18.615 --> 00:15:20.049
Jack.

186
00:15:21.317 --> 00:15:23.921
- Rose. darling. let him go.
- Jack.

187
00:15:31.495 --> 00:15:32.596
Do you know?

188
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:34.263
Boys who are away from home

189
00:15:34.297 --> 00:15:37.568
still get presents
for their birthday.

190
00:15:37.601 --> 00:15:41.605
My hat. you'll still make it
for me. won't you?

191
00:15:42.271 --> 00:15:43.407
Of course.

192
00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.187
It's an eagle feather.

193
00:15:59.322 --> 00:16:01.658
The most sacred
of all Indian symbols.

194
00:16:01.692 --> 00:16:03.727
What does it stand for?

195
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.597
- Courage.
- Courage.

196
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:11.502
Well. we can all use a little
extra courage now and then.

197
00:16:13.336 --> 00:16:17.273
<i>The Golden Key.</i> Again.

198
00:16:17.306 --> 00:16:18.775
It's my favorite.

199
00:16:18.809 --> 00:16:20.611
Oh. I know.

200
00:16:26.683 --> 00:16:28.752
We need to check
for the monsters.

201
00:16:35.324 --> 00:16:36.793
Found one.

202
00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:43.399
- Good night. my loves.
- Good night.

203
00:17:00.684 --> 00:17:03.085
I don't want you to go away.

204
00:17:06.423 --> 00:17:09.058
How about I leave my shadow behind while I'm gone?

205
00:17:10.827 --> 00:17:13.329
He's sillier than I am.

206
00:17:13.362 --> 00:17:16.098
so you'll have to keep him
out of trouble.

207
00:17:16.132 --> 00:17:17.568
- Deal?
- Yeah.

208
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.571
Not me. Him.

209
00:17:22.506 --> 00:17:23.574
Deal.

210
00:17:31.915 --> 00:17:34.685
Do people really forget
how to dream when they grow up?

211
00:17:34.718 --> 00:17:37.186
Aunt Eleanor certainly has.

212
00:17:37.219 --> 00:17:38.789
But have Mother and Father?

213
00:17:39.656 --> 00:17:40.891
Why not?

214
00:17:40.924 --> 00:17:43.627
I reckon some people
have extra dream dust

215
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.562
that can travel
out of the nursery windows

216
00:17:45.596 --> 00:17:47.864
and be absorbed by grown-ups.

217
00:17:47.898 --> 00:17:51.435
Should we open the window. then?
Just to be sure?

218
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:53.336
Great idea.

219
00:18:32.308 --> 00:18:34.578
I saw the letter
from your teacher.

220
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.180
You're not to go outside today

221
00:18:38.214 --> 00:18:39.716
until you've finished
your arithmetic.

222
00:18:41.485 --> 00:18:42.619
All right?

223
00:18:49.993 --> 00:18:51.628
- Morning.
- Morning.

224
00:18:58.702 --> 00:19:00.771
- What's that?
- Uh...

225
00:19:01.872 --> 00:19:03.740
List of supplies.

226
00:19:03.774 --> 00:19:07.778
- For old Mr. Brown's replica?
- That's exactly right.

227
00:19:07.811 --> 00:19:09.980
I'm going into London today
to get them.

228
00:19:10.013 --> 00:19:12.281
I might also catch
an old friend.

229
00:19:15.018 --> 00:19:16.486
Will you be long?

230
00:19:20.256 --> 00:19:21.458
No.

231
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.928
Toodle-oo. Peter.

232
00:19:40.744 --> 00:19:44.313
Dishes and arithmetic.
What a dreadful day.

233
00:19:47.349 --> 00:19:49.519
Why are you so good at this?

234
00:19:53.657 --> 00:19:55.224
I can't do this.

235
00:19:57.393 --> 00:19:59.663
No. That was nothing.

236
00:20:00.997 --> 00:20:02.833
Oh. you've won.

237
00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:06.536
Can we go and play
hide-and-seek now?

238
00:20:15.545 --> 00:20:16.947
<i>The bustle of London</i>

239
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.716
<i>held an edge of mystery
in our minds.</i>

240
00:20:21.017 --> 00:20:24.020
<i>We knew our father
had a life before us.</i>

241
00:20:24.054 --> 00:20:26.923
<i>but what that life
had actually been...</i>

242
00:20:28.592 --> 00:20:30.627
<i>We could scarcely imagine.</i>

243
00:20:32.462 --> 00:20:33.864
Have you seen your dad?

244
00:20:35.397 --> 00:20:36.600
No.

245
00:20:37.601 --> 00:20:38.835
The boss?

246
00:20:38.869 --> 00:20:41.303
Uh. I've needed to stay away.

247
00:20:41.905 --> 00:20:43.907
How is he?

248
00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.942
He's still the boss. isn't he?

249
00:20:47.444 --> 00:20:51.581
Have you ever thought of coming
by. for old times' sake?

250
00:20:53.583 --> 00:20:55.317
We both know I can't.

251
00:20:59.089 --> 00:21:00.791
How's the rest of your family?

252
00:21:00.824 --> 00:21:04.961
My eldest son will soon be
leaving for Bristlemoss.

253
00:21:04.995 --> 00:21:08.932
Oh. Will you look at that?
You must be proud.

254
00:21:10.967 --> 00:21:13.637
Yeah. Suppose I am.

255
00:21:14.938 --> 00:21:18.742
My own boy. Bristlemoss.

256
00:21:18.775 --> 00:21:20.376
Who'd have thought it. eh?

257
00:21:21.945 --> 00:21:24.781
I should get him something.

258
00:21:24.815 --> 00:21:27.851
The boy deserves a gift
for an accomplishment like that.

259
00:21:27.884 --> 00:21:29.385
doesn't he?

260
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.692
I found you.

261
00:21:35.725 --> 00:21:37.794
You hardly gave me a challenge.

262
00:22:04.855 --> 00:22:07.657
- Let me help.
- I don't need your help.

263
00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:09.159
Mama will let you play
once you're done.

264
00:22:09.192 --> 00:22:10.660
Leave me alone.

265
00:22:12.062 --> 00:22:15.599
You were never planning on repairing
that boat with me. were you?

266
00:22:15.632 --> 00:22:17.133
Of course I was.
I didn't know I'd get...

267
00:22:17.167 --> 00:22:19.402
It doesn't matter.

268
00:22:19.436 --> 00:22:22.005
Go to your stupid school.

269
00:22:22.038 --> 00:22:24.174
You're just like
all the rest of them.

270
00:22:24.207 --> 00:22:26.076
But not me.

271
00:22:26.109 --> 00:22:28.612
No one will catch me
and make me a man.

272
00:22:32.048 --> 00:22:33.416
Hard at work?

273
00:22:34.851 --> 00:22:37.354
Uh. I just wanted to...

274
00:22:38.922 --> 00:22:40.090
David?

275
00:22:46.062 --> 00:22:48.131
For the man of the moment.

276
00:22:50.734 --> 00:22:52.068
Well. open it.

277
00:22:55.939 --> 00:22:57.841
It's just like...

278
00:22:57.874 --> 00:23:00.677
The one my father
gave to me. yes.

279
00:23:01.778 --> 00:23:03.813
You never met your grandfather.

280
00:23:03.847 --> 00:23:05.849
Um. he...

281
00:23:06.583 --> 00:23:09.586
Had high hopes for me.

282
00:23:09.619 --> 00:23:13.089
I'm afraid I never quite fulfilled them.

283
00:23:14.224 --> 00:23:18.461
But I want you to know
I'm proud of you. David.

284
00:23:30.607 --> 00:23:32.809
All right. I'll let you
get back to it.

285
00:23:37.814 --> 00:23:39.849
Give me that.

286
00:23:39.883 --> 00:23:42.652
We'll still have time
for adventures before I leave.

287
00:23:42.686 --> 00:23:44.821
What are you doing?

288
00:24:10.814 --> 00:24:13.717
Pirates.
This could be dangerous.

289
00:24:15.919 --> 00:24:17.887
You can retreat if you want.

290
00:24:17.921 --> 00:24:20.557
Go back if you want.
Bristlemoss boy.

291
00:24:21.257 --> 00:24:22.659
I'm not scared.

292
00:24:22.692 --> 00:24:23.927
Neither am I.

293
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:28.631
One... Two...

294
00:24:29.032 --> 00:24:30.200
Three.

295
00:24:36.906 --> 00:24:38.641
I know you're here!

296
00:24:40.076 --> 00:24:41.711
Come out and fight!

297
00:24:42.579 --> 00:24:43.713
Come here!

298
00:24:43.747 --> 00:24:45.849
I'll fight all the pirates
in the sea.

299
00:24:50.887 --> 00:24:51.888
Yah!

300
00:24:53.189 --> 00:24:54.758
Behind you!

301
00:25:03.299 --> 00:25:04.667
Up above!

302
00:25:07.337 --> 00:25:08.905
Well done. David!

303
00:25:09.973 --> 00:25:13.610
Yay!

304
00:25:13.643 --> 00:25:15.311
Whoo!

305
00:25:32.362 --> 00:25:33.997
David!

306
00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:55.251
Argh!

307
00:27:21.938 --> 00:27:23.806
I miss David.

308
00:27:40.957 --> 00:27:42.959
- Did you see that?
- What?

309
00:27:43.326 --> 00:27:44.994
That's it.

310
00:27:45.028 --> 00:27:48.231
We were playing hide-and-seek
and now he wants me to find him.

311
00:27:48.264 --> 00:27:49.433
Alice.

312
00:27:51.367 --> 00:27:52.835
He's gone.

313
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.039
He's gone.
and it's because of me.

314
00:27:56.072 --> 00:27:57.740
Peter. please.

315
00:28:52.395 --> 00:28:54.565
<i>You can retreat
if you want.</i>

316
00:28:54.598 --> 00:28:57.400
<i>Go back if you want.
Bristlemoss boy.</i>

317
00:29:03.574 --> 00:29:05.275
No. Alice.

318
00:29:10.947 --> 00:29:12.215
Mama?

319
00:29:12.949 --> 00:29:14.250
Go and play.

320
00:29:18.955 --> 00:29:21.090
What are you doing?

321
00:29:21.124 --> 00:29:24.461
Making a hat for David.
as I promised.

322
00:29:30.199 --> 00:29:31.834
Did you hear that. Tink?

323
00:29:31.868 --> 00:29:35.572
She's making him a hat.
He will come back.

324
00:29:39.175 --> 00:29:40.843
There we are.

325
00:29:40.877 --> 00:29:43.012
Why isn't Mama tucking us in?

326
00:29:43.447 --> 00:29:45.582
I want Mama.

327
00:29:45.616 --> 00:29:47.418
Your mother needs her rest.

328
00:29:56.259 --> 00:29:59.195
Come on. then.
Let's read a story.

329
00:29:59.228 --> 00:30:03.066
Goody! Tell us the story
about the orphanage.

330
00:30:04.501 --> 00:30:05.935
Let's see.

331
00:30:07.404 --> 00:30:09.972
I think this is the right one.

332
00:30:12.208 --> 00:30:14.277
"Long ago.

333
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:17.280
<i>"in a faraway land.</i>

334
00:30:17.313 --> 00:30:20.316
<i>"there was an orphanage.</i>

335
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:23.620
<i>"By day. the children did
as they were told.</i>

336
00:30:24.588 --> 00:30:26.856
<i>"They studied hard.</i>

337
00:30:27.957 --> 00:30:30.494
<i>"They worked hard.</i>

338
00:30:32.496 --> 00:30:37.266
<i>"And they never. ever
played games.</i>

339
00:30:41.705 --> 00:30:43.407
<i>"But at night.</i>

340
00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:47.176
<i>"when they were left alone.</i>

341
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:52.181
<i>"their golden dream dust
would fill the room</i>

342
00:30:52.215 --> 00:30:55.985
<i>"and take them far. far away.</i>

343
00:30:57.019 --> 00:30:58.555
<i>"and no matter how he tried.</i>

344
00:30:58.589 --> 00:31:00.557
<i>"their keeper
couldn't stop them</i>

345
00:31:00.591 --> 00:31:04.360
<i>"from escaping
into their dreams."</i>

346
00:31:04.394 --> 00:31:06.463
<i>'Cause being a grown-up.</i>

347
00:31:06.497 --> 00:31:09.232
<i>he had forgotten
how to dream long ago.</i>

348
00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:15.938
Peter. whatever's the matter
with you?

349
00:31:15.972 --> 00:31:20.343
I think I'm getting too old
for bedtime stories. that's all.

350
00:31:21.177 --> 00:31:22.378
Good night.

351
00:31:24.548 --> 00:31:26.282
Off to bed.

352
00:31:51.007 --> 00:31:52.108
Peter.

353
00:32:20.069 --> 00:32:22.606
<i>I don't want you
to go away.</i>

354
00:32:44.193 --> 00:32:46.730
<i>No one will catch me
and make me a man.</i>

355
00:33:30.172 --> 00:33:32.576
<i>We'll be
the Lost Boys of the wild.</i>

356
00:33:39.382 --> 00:33:41.250
Catch us if you can!

357
00:33:44.287 --> 00:33:45.822
Wait for me!

358
00:33:47.624 --> 00:33:51.394
You'll never catch us!
We're the Lost Boys of the wild!

359
00:33:52.529 --> 00:33:54.196
Wait!

360
00:34:05.676 --> 00:34:07.109
Hello?

361
00:34:09.312 --> 00:34:10.814
Hello?

362
00:34:16.887 --> 00:34:18.455
Rose?

363
00:34:25.729 --> 00:34:27.196
Mmm.

364
00:34:33.437 --> 00:34:34.738
Rose?

365
00:35:26.355 --> 00:35:27.591
Charlie.

366
00:35:28.692 --> 00:35:31.461
Oh. Jack.
I'm sorry about your son.

367
00:35:31.495 --> 00:35:32.696
Deal me in.

368
00:35:36.867 --> 00:35:38.468
I said deal me in.

369
00:35:41.638 --> 00:35:42.873
Give me your cards.

370
00:35:44.541 --> 00:35:45.776
You too.

371
00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:22.311
Well. you certainly
seem to be enjoying yourself.

372
00:36:24.648 --> 00:36:26.850
What makes you think
you can come in here

373
00:36:26.883 --> 00:36:28.885
and play these tables. hmm?

374
00:36:28.919 --> 00:36:30.721
My debts were cleared away
years ago.

375
00:36:30.754 --> 00:36:31.955
Is that so?

376
00:36:33.457 --> 00:36:35.826
Just had a bad run.
fellas.

377
00:36:35.859 --> 00:36:38.360
My luck is bound to turn
in good time.

378
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:43.433
Look. all right.

379
00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:47.604
Give this to that boss of yours.

380
00:36:51.875 --> 00:36:54.444
Tell him he knows
I'm good for it. all right?

381
00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:00.851
I'm sure he's gonna love this.

382
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:06.223
Rose?

383
00:37:07.924 --> 00:37:10.494
Rose?

384
00:37:10.527 --> 00:37:12.996
Rose.
haven't you heard a word I've said?

385
00:37:19.335 --> 00:37:20.537
Actually...

386
00:37:23.473 --> 00:37:26.810
I'd like you to come and stay
with William and me for a while.

387
00:37:26.843 --> 00:37:28.945
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

388
00:37:28.979 --> 00:37:31.014
I just don't understand.

389
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:36.318
Until you're a mother.
you never will.

390
00:37:38.855 --> 00:37:40.023
I see.

391
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.828
Never mind.

392
00:37:46.129 --> 00:37:48.598
<i>My mother seemed to be lost.</i>

393
00:37:50.834 --> 00:37:52.769
<i>I couldn't reach her.</i>

394
00:37:54.738 --> 00:37:57.607
<i>So I reached for a heart
I could touch instead.</i>

395
00:37:57.641 --> 00:37:59.676
Would you like some tea?

396
00:38:02.445 --> 00:38:05.081
We would be ever so grateful
for the company.

397
00:38:11.855 --> 00:38:13.089
Thank you.

398
00:38:22.899 --> 00:38:24.768
Oh. Uh.

399
00:38:54.097 --> 00:38:56.666
Would you like to see
a real teahouse?

400
00:39:18.788 --> 00:39:21.591
Mmm.
Thank you so much.

401
00:39:40.543 --> 00:39:41.978
Are you enjoying yourself?

402
00:39:44.514 --> 00:39:45.782
Ah. you have a...

403
00:39:47.617 --> 00:39:49.753
Yes. a little bit
of cream just...

404
00:39:51.154 --> 00:39:52.889
A little bit lower.

405
00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:58.662
Almost gone.

406
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.432
Ah! Isn't this nice?

407
00:40:04.134 --> 00:40:07.904
It's a shame we haven't spent
much time together before.

408
00:40:07.938 --> 00:40:10.607
You really are a lovely girl.

409
00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.076
I'm not a girl. I'm a lady.

410
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:15.512
Then I think you should know.

411
00:40:15.545 --> 00:40:18.915
a lady never rests her elbows
on the table.

412
00:40:23.153 --> 00:40:28.458
A lady also only crosses
her legs at the ankles.

413
00:40:33.196 --> 00:40:34.931
Oh. you poor thing.

414
00:40:34.965 --> 00:40:37.801
You just want to be brought up
in a civilized manner.

415
00:40:37.834 --> 00:40:39.235
Is that not so?

416
00:40:41.104 --> 00:40:45.141
You need my help. and my help
is what you're going to get.

417
00:40:45.175 --> 00:40:48.611
A lady should never gnaw
on her fingernails.

418
00:40:48.645 --> 00:40:51.848
It is a disgusting habit
of the lower class.

419
00:40:51.881 --> 00:40:56.152
And just because your father
is from that class.

420
00:40:56.186 --> 00:40:59.823
it does not mean
that you have to be too.

421
00:40:59.856 --> 00:41:02.258
We will make a lady of you yet.

422
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.135
It's perfect.

423
00:41:13.737 --> 00:41:15.939
It was the last thing
I promised him.

424
00:41:17.107 --> 00:41:18.241
I know.

425
00:41:28.051 --> 00:41:29.586
I have news.

426
00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:42.165
Peter. that is wonderful.

427
00:41:42.198 --> 00:41:43.566
Oh. my.

428
00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.235
I want to take David's place.

429
00:41:46.736 --> 00:41:48.038
at Bristlemoss.

430
00:41:48.938 --> 00:41:50.840
I can make you proud too.

431
00:41:51.941 --> 00:41:55.578
Peter. you've always
made us proud.

432
00:42:00.216 --> 00:42:01.851
- Stay back.
- No. no. no.

433
00:42:01.885 --> 00:42:04.154
I told you
to pay your debt. Littleton!

434
00:42:07.323 --> 00:42:08.825
Everyone all right?

435
00:42:22.338 --> 00:42:24.707
Rose. I can explain.

436
00:42:24.741 --> 00:42:26.209
We need to send for the police.

437
00:42:26.242 --> 00:42:28.845
No. no. He's got the police
in his pocket.

438
00:42:28.878 --> 00:42:31.881
Why? Why?
After all these years?

439
00:42:31.915 --> 00:42:34.851
- You know what he's like.
- I'll pay it off.

440
00:42:34.884 --> 00:42:37.220
Once I finish <i>The Golden Hind</i>
for Mr. Brown.

441
00:42:37.253 --> 00:42:39.956
we'll have enough
to pay off my debt.

442
00:42:39.989 --> 00:42:41.958
- Rose...
- Finish it. then.

443
00:42:41.991 --> 00:42:44.194
- Rose. Rose.
- Finish it. Hannah.

444
00:42:46.329 --> 00:42:47.964
Children.

445
00:43:02.045 --> 00:43:03.346
What are you doing?

446
00:43:08.084 --> 00:43:09.786
Alice. go back to sleep.

447
00:43:11.287 --> 00:43:12.789
Peter.

448
00:43:21.264 --> 00:43:24.167
What happened tonight.
the trouble Father's in.

449
00:43:25.802 --> 00:43:28.304
it never would have happened
if David were here.

450
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:33.676
And if it had. he wouldn't have
stood by and watched.

451
00:43:37.113 --> 00:43:38.281
Wait.

452
00:43:40.283 --> 00:43:41.951
I want to help.

453
00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.022
Alice. get down.

454
00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:39.342
Evening. sweetheart.

455
00:44:39.375 --> 00:44:41.244
Can you spare any pennies?

456
00:44:42.145 --> 00:44:44.481
Oh. I've had enough
of this.

457
00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:46.249
I'm going for an ale.

458
00:44:51.488 --> 00:44:54.958
Oh. no. no. no.
I don't take any myself.

459
00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.302
- Oi! Watch it!
- Go. go. go!

460
00:45:06.336 --> 00:45:09.806
- Oi!
- Oi!

461
00:45:09.839 --> 00:45:12.175
- Out of the way!
- Hurry up! He's coming!

462
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:14.944
Hurry up! Come on!

463
00:45:17.847 --> 00:45:21.150
Get back here!
You dirty little vermin!

464
00:45:21.184 --> 00:45:23.853
- Run! Go!
- Move. you sop!

465
00:45:25.288 --> 00:45:28.091
Wait till I get my hands on you.
you rats!

466
00:45:31.027 --> 00:45:33.296
Hurry up!
Get out of the way!

467
00:45:33.329 --> 00:45:35.832
D'you hear me?
You little scum!

468
00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:45.208
Alice. go!

469
00:45:46.042 --> 00:45:47.877
You little toerag!

470
00:45:58.221 --> 00:46:02.392
If I get my hands on you...
I'm gonna kill you!

471
00:46:06.996 --> 00:46:08.532
Why are you following us?

472
00:46:08.565 --> 00:46:10.534
'Cause of you we lost the loot.

473
00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:11.934
You mean this?

474
00:46:18.274 --> 00:46:21.244
Would you happen to know the way
to the pawn shop?

475
00:46:35.391 --> 00:46:37.528
This is where we leave you.

476
00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:39.028
You're not coming?

477
00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:40.464
We've got business at the Row.

478
00:46:49.906 --> 00:46:51.442
How can we repay you?

479
00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:05.121
Hello?

480
00:47:39.021 --> 00:47:40.289
Is anyone there?

481
00:47:40.323 --> 00:47:42.358
Children. children!

482
00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:46.195
Games and games.
and what are your names. hmm?

483
00:47:46.229 --> 00:47:48.297
- Peter.
- Peter...

484
00:47:48.331 --> 00:47:49.966
- Little...
- Pan.

485
00:47:50.967 --> 00:47:54.137
Peter Pan and Tiger Lily.

486
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:57.106
Can you answer me a riddle?

487
00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.443
- I love riddles.
- She loves riddles.

488
00:48:00.243 --> 00:48:04.113
How is a raven like...

489
00:48:05.114 --> 00:48:07.451
A writing desk? Hmm?

490
00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:09.686
How is a raven
like a writing desk?

491
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.655
How much will you give me
for this?

492
00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:25.636
Must you sell it?

493
00:48:29.205 --> 00:48:33.042
Hmm! Let us all move
one pace on.

494
00:49:02.271 --> 00:49:03.407
Thank you.

495
00:49:22.124 --> 00:49:23.993
Alice. look.

496
00:50:37.568 --> 00:50:39.368
What do you have for me?

497
00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:04.260
Have you guessed
the riddle yet?

498
00:51:04.293 --> 00:51:06.597
No. What's the answer?

499
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:09.098
I haven't
the slightest idea.

500
00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.367
Ooh. May I?

501
00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.404
Your hair wants cutting.

502
00:51:14.438 --> 00:51:15.539
Father!

503
00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:23.547
We've got guests.

504
00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:27.383
Customers. yes. yes. we know.

505
00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:31.320
What are your names. then?

506
00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:33.890
- Peter Pan.
- I'm Tiger Lily.

507
00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:35.726
Indeed.

508
00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:41.465
And you can call me...

509
00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:44.868
CJ.

510
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:56.178
It's quite
an extraordinary piece.

511
00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:59.716
And the inscription is...

512
00:52:01.317 --> 00:52:02.351
Somewhat...

513
00:52:05.354 --> 00:52:06.690
Personal.

514
00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:09.158
It was a gift from our father.

515
00:52:11.995 --> 00:52:13.697
Complicated. aren't they?

516
00:52:19.536 --> 00:52:21.203
Fathers.

517
00:52:27.678 --> 00:52:29.746
Are you sure you're
willing to part with him?

518
00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:32.181
What?

519
00:52:37.587 --> 00:52:42.258
I said are you sure you're
willing to part with it?

520
00:52:42.291 --> 00:52:43.694
We need to sell it.

521
00:52:55.539 --> 00:52:56.840
Well. then.

522
00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:02.311
let's do business.

523
00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.756
We did it. We really did it.

524
00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:17.494
I can't wait to see Papa's face
in the morning.

525
00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:37.073
<i>I've often
wondered when it was</i>

526
00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:40.677
<i>that my brother and I
were set on different paths.</i>

527
00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.449
<i>We were wounded
by the same hurts.</i>

528
00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:50.352
Alice. wake up.

529
00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:55.559
<i>Soothed by the same lullabies.</i>

530
00:54:58.495 --> 00:55:01.464
<i>Was there a single moment
when we diverged?</i>

531
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:29.059
You're standing
on my foot!

532
00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:43.372
The Lost Boys at your service.
We want you to come with us.

533
00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:09.900
Where did you get this?

534
00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:13.063
Alice. what are you doing?

535
00:57:14.064 --> 00:57:16.633
I told you always to knock.

536
00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.034
I'm sorry. Mama.

537
00:57:19.736 --> 00:57:21.471
What does your potion do?

538
00:57:22.572 --> 00:57:26.576
Never you mind.
This is not for children.

539
00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:29.245
It is not ever for children.

540
00:57:29.279 --> 00:57:32.749
I'm not a child.
I'm a young lady.

541
00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:35.952
I know all about
how a lady acts.

542
00:57:35.986 --> 00:57:39.923
For instance. nail biting
is unacceptable for a lady.

543
00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:42.625
It's a disgusting habit
of the lower class.

544
00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:43.626
The lower class?

545
00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.096
Just because Father
is of that class does not...

546
00:57:47.998 --> 00:57:51.134
Don't you ever speak
of your father that way. Ever!

547
00:57:54.704 --> 00:57:55.939
Go to your room.

548
00:58:11.087 --> 00:58:13.690
<i>Take me away from here.
Tinker Bell.</i>

549
00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:17.660
I know you're a real fairy.

550
00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:19.729
You can show yourself to me.

551
00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:21.631
It's safe.

552
00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:34.878
<i>Tink. please.</i>

553
00:58:47.791 --> 00:58:48.958
Tink?

554
00:58:57.967 --> 00:58:59.836
I'm so sorry. Tink.

555
00:59:01.771 --> 00:59:03.239
<i>Mr. Littleton. sir.</i>

556
00:59:03.273 --> 00:59:05.108
Oh. thank you. Wells.

557
00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:09.779
Jack. good to see you.

558
00:59:09.813 --> 00:59:11.681
Mr. Brown.

559
00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:17.353
Uh. please. can I interest you
in some mock turtle soup?

560
00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:19.222
Oh. no. No. thank you. sir.

561
00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:21.291
No. Wise man.

562
00:59:22.358 --> 00:59:24.928
What can I do for you?

563
00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:27.363
Well. I know it took longer
than we discussed.

564
00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:32.268
but the replica you commissioned
has been completed. sir.

565
00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:39.809
Oh. that is exquisite.

566
00:59:39.843 --> 00:59:43.079
Your work never ceases
to impress. Jack.

567
00:59:43.113 --> 00:59:46.149
But this particular replica

568
00:59:46.182 --> 00:59:49.819
was meant as a birthday gift
for my grandson.

569
00:59:50.454 --> 00:59:51.988
Shall I inscribe it. sir?

570
00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:56.025
His birthday
was over a week ago.

571
00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:59.395
I heard word of what happened
to your son. I'm so sorry.

572
00:59:59.430 --> 01:00:04.234
I sent Wells to inquire.
but you were never at home.

573
01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:08.037
You see. I had no choice
but to hire...

574
01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:11.674
Another craftsman
to do the job.

575
01:00:13.477 --> 01:00:16.045
I'm sure you can understand.

576
01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.321
Yes.

577
01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.960
Yes. of course.

578
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:35.832
Thank you. sir.

579
01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:52.782
Yes?

580
01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:14.003
I'm sorry for what I said.

581
01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:37.794
I slapped Alice.

582
01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:41.397
Rose. how could you?

583
01:01:41.432 --> 01:01:44.300
The way she looked at me. Ellie.

584
01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:51.040
I just haven't
been myself since...

585
01:01:54.445 --> 01:01:55.512
I just...

586
01:01:55.546 --> 01:01:58.482
I just wanted to hold onto him.
just a little longer.

587
01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:09.526
Now there's everything
with Jack.

588
01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.895
What about Jack?
What's happened?

589
01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:17.501
Noth...
I shouldn't have mentioned...

590
01:02:18.602 --> 01:02:20.803
I just...

591
01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:23.574
For God's sake. Rose.
stop biting your nails.

592
01:02:23.607 --> 01:02:25.842
I haven't seen you bite your
nails since you were a girl.

593
01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.478
It's the most disgusting
habit of the lower class

594
01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:28.878
and you know that.

595
01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:34.884
And just because Jack
is of that class.

596
01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:36.853
it doesn't mean we have to be.

597
01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:41.391
Is that what you said
to my daughter?

598
01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:45.828
He's her father. Ellie.

599
01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:48.565
Rose. listen to me.
you have to understand...

600
01:02:48.599 --> 01:02:49.899
Rose.

601
01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:21.598
I knew he'd leave me a clue.

602
01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:48.625
All children have been
to Neverland.

603
01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:51.327
But most of them
lose their Neverlands forever

604
01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:54.631
when they get all...
All growed up.

605
01:03:54.665 --> 01:03:57.434
Their heads get filled
with all kinds of muck.

606
01:03:57.468 --> 01:03:58.968
Like neckties.

607
01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:02.105
And taxidermies.

608
01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:05.341
- Most children?
- Most. but not all.

609
01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:07.578
Have you ever heard
of dream dust?

610
01:04:07.611 --> 01:04:09.145
<i>Dream dust?</i>

611
01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:32.669
<i>Dream dust is the stuff
that makes us remember.</i>

612
01:04:32.703 --> 01:04:35.938
<i>It's the reason you can
build sandcastles in the sky.</i>

613
01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:52.456
<i>Or take a voyage
to the moon.</i>

614
01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:54.123
<i>All right.</i>

615
01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:56.392
But what does that
have to do with me?

616
01:04:56.427 --> 01:05:00.431
You have more dream dust
than anyone we've ever seen.

617
01:05:01.498 --> 01:05:03.734
You never have to grow up.

618
01:05:03.767 --> 01:05:07.003
Come to Neverland with us. Pan.
and be a boy forever.

619
01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:08.971
I have to grow up. Nibs.

620
01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:15.044
My family. all their
expectations lie in me now.

621
01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:19.182
Don't you see? It isn't
their expectations inside you.

622
01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:20.651
It's their dreams.

623
01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:28.785
<i>What does your potion do?</i>

624
01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:39.530
Please. potion.
take me away from here.

625
01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:41.732
Make me disappear.

626
01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:25.274
Papa?

627
01:07:45.796 --> 01:07:47.564
Here.

628
01:07:47.598 --> 01:07:50.467
You can use it
to pay off those men.

629
01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:56.707
How did you get this?

630
01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:02.479
This is not your burden to bear.

631
01:08:02.512 --> 01:08:05.281
Peter. you're...
You're not to worry.

632
01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:08.752
Don't you understand?
Everything's all right now.

633
01:08:10.887 --> 01:08:13.757
That's what you needed.
and I got it for you.

634
01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.463
Where did you get this?

635
01:08:20.530 --> 01:08:22.264
No.

636
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:29.773
Where did you get this?
Answer me!

637
01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:32.809
Peter.

638
01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:35.378
Peter.

639
01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:46.790
Peter!

640
01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:49.793
Peter?

641
01:08:51.628 --> 01:08:53.597
Let me take care of this.

642
01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:57.434
This is my problem.
not yours.

643
01:08:59.002 --> 01:09:00.403
Peter.

644
01:09:04.775 --> 01:09:05.942
Peter.

645
01:09:08.979 --> 01:09:10.346
Peter?

646
01:09:20.791 --> 01:09:22.693
If you're here. come out.

647
01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.330
I want to come with you.

648
01:09:28.364 --> 01:09:32.502
<i>The bond between
my brothers was deep and true.</i>

649
01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:38.975
<i>But not all brothers
are as lucky.</i>

650
01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:43.714
<i>and when fathers
divide their sons...</i>

651
01:09:44.448 --> 01:09:45.849
Hello. Father.

652
01:09:45.882 --> 01:09:48.552
<i>...it can
all go terribly wrong.</i>

653
01:09:48.585 --> 01:09:49.619
My boy!

654
01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:54.424
Oh!

655
01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:56.560
James. look here.

656
01:09:58.662 --> 01:10:02.364
This is my son Jack.

657
01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:04.534
home from university.

658
01:10:05.469 --> 01:10:07.537
Tell Margaret to come down...

659
01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:10.306
And put the kettle on.

660
01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:11.942
- Come. come. come.
- I'm alright. I'm alright.

661
01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:14.310
Sit. Sit.

662
01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:17.246
- He's a bit slow.
- Enough!

663
01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:23.285
I don't have the money. James.

664
01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:26.656
I need more time.

665
01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:31.661
After 12 years.
that's all you have to say?

666
01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:37.601
Have a drink
with your brother. Jack.

667
01:10:37.634 --> 01:10:39.401
We'll discuss business later.

668
01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:43.673
Bottoms up.

669
01:10:50.514 --> 01:10:54.383
Your leftover brats.
they're wilier than I expected.

670
01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:56.486
for two pampered little toffs.

671
01:10:57.921 --> 01:11:01.357
They showed up.
Can you imagine?

672
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:06.429
Two little mice traipsing
into the mouth of a crocodile.

673
01:11:06.463 --> 01:11:08.364
And you were gentle with 'em.

674
01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:10.467
I appreciate that.

675
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.569
They're my flesh and blood.
Jack.

676
01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:15.739
Not all of us
betray our families.

677
01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:20.309
Plus. they came
bearing treasures

678
01:11:21.411 --> 01:11:22.679
from a long forgotten past.

679
01:11:23.547 --> 01:11:24.815
"To our son. with pride."

680
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:28.652
Touching as ever.

681
01:11:30.587 --> 01:11:33.790
So. right back where we began.

682
01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:39.696
I was a lost man. Father.

683
01:11:40.664 --> 01:11:43.767
I had to get away. I had to.

684
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.603
And yet
here you are again.

685
01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:49.338
Perhaps this is where
you always belonged.

686
01:11:51.942 --> 01:11:53.543
I'm nothing like you.

687
01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.980
Father.

688
01:11:59.883 --> 01:12:01.618
Go lay down. Father.

689
01:12:02.953 --> 01:12:05.555
Yes. I'll go lay down.

690
01:12:13.029 --> 01:12:17.167
I'll get you
the money soon. all right?

691
01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.401
The rules never really
did apply to you.

692
01:12:19.436 --> 01:12:21.805
- did they. little Jack?
- I just need some more time.

693
01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.907
Always an arrogant
little snob.

694
01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:28.478
I lost my son. James.
I lost my son.

695
01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:29.713
Please.

696
01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:34.117
Please.

697
01:12:35.652 --> 01:12:37.420
I'm still your brother.

698
01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:43.960
Well. then. brother...

699
01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:49.099
For once in your life.

700
01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:53.603
you shall pay your debt.

701
01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:05.715
<i>Rose!</i>

702
01:13:07.484 --> 01:13:09.419
He crushed my hand.

703
01:13:13.256 --> 01:13:16.026
All I did was
ask for more time.

704
01:13:19.529 --> 01:13:20.830
I'll kill him.

705
01:13:22.098 --> 01:13:23.566
I'll kill him.

706
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:28.538
Off with his head.

707
01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:32.575
<i>Don't you ever speak
of your father that way. ever!</i>

708
01:13:34.177 --> 01:13:35.512
Darling?

709
01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.581
Alice?

710
01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:40.850
Leave me alone.

711
01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:43.954
We need
to get a doctor.

712
01:13:43.987 --> 01:13:45.722
I'll get the doctor.

713
01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:50.060
Peter.

714
01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:54.030
We've always been alike.

715
01:13:54.064 --> 01:13:57.534
A little bit lighter
than the world will allow.

716
01:13:57.567 --> 01:13:59.736
Don't let life drag you down.

717
01:14:01.638 --> 01:14:06.009
You just keep floating above it.
long as you can.

718
01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:07.243
You promise?

719
01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:12.615
Peter... You promise?

720
01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.588
I promise.

721
01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:33.770
She's upstairs.

722
01:14:42.946 --> 01:14:44.280
Leave me alone.

723
01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:48.651
My mother's not in here.

724
01:14:49.586 --> 01:14:51.254
I didn't come for your mother.

725
01:14:52.622 --> 01:14:53.923
I came for you.

726
01:14:55.358 --> 01:14:56.693
Look.

727
01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:12.776
Rose. darling. how's Jack?

728
01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:15.779
They took
his hand. Eleanor.

729
01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:18.648
He's a craftsman.
He can't work.

730
01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.750
I want you to know
that William and I

731
01:15:20.784 --> 01:15:23.053
will do anything we can
to help you

732
01:15:23.086 --> 01:15:25.722
until Jack
is back on his feet again.

733
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:27.724
Under one condition.

734
01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:31.227
Alice comes with me.

735
01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:37.067
Get out.

736
01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.935
I'll raise her properly. Rose.

737
01:15:38.968 --> 01:15:42.872
see that she's well-groomed
and well married.

738
01:15:42.906 --> 01:15:44.674
Leave my house.

739
01:15:46.843 --> 01:15:48.244
Even if I do.

740
01:15:49.779 --> 01:15:52.715
I can't promise
that she'll stay away from me.

741
01:15:52.749 --> 01:15:55.885
You see. darling.
it was Alice that suggested it.

742
01:15:59.856 --> 01:16:00.957
Leave.

743
01:16:02.659 --> 01:16:04.961
- Get out. Eleanor.
- Rose.

744
01:16:04.994 --> 01:16:06.296
Get out.

745
01:16:07.697 --> 01:16:09.799
It's for the best.

746
01:16:09.833 --> 01:16:12.035
You will see
it's for the best.

747
01:16:22.345 --> 01:16:24.247
What's that?

748
01:16:30.687 --> 01:16:33.790
I thought you might like
to have your things up here.

749
01:16:37.428 --> 01:16:38.895
Here. let me help.

750
01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:41.064
No. no. no. Peter.

751
01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:51.174
It's over now.

752
01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:54.978
No one
is going to bother us now.

753
01:16:55.011 --> 01:16:56.980
Not my brother. not anyone.

754
01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:00.350
It's over.

755
01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:02.919
It's over.

756
01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:18.935
CJ did that to Father. Alice.

757
01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.770
- He's our uncle.
- What?

758
01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:22.705
CJ's our uncle.

759
01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:26.075
Our own family did this to us.

760
01:17:26.109 --> 01:17:27.810
Let go of me.

761
01:17:29.179 --> 01:17:30.947
He's going to pay.

762
01:17:32.015 --> 01:17:33.883
and I know how. too.

763
01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.423
No. Peter. you can't.

764
01:17:39.456 --> 01:17:41.791
They'll come after you.

765
01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:46.296
Which is why I won't be able
to come back. Not ever.

766
01:17:48.031 --> 01:17:49.699
Come with me.

767
01:18:00.143 --> 01:18:02.011
I'm going to live
with Aunt Eleanor.

768
01:18:02.045 --> 01:18:03.313
Aunt Eleanor?

769
01:18:04.814 --> 01:18:07.150
She'll turn you into a lady.

770
01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:10.353
You won't be able to play
or make up stories.

771
01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:12.855
It's time for me to grow up.

772
01:18:19.463 --> 01:18:25.068
And this tinker's bell
was born for you.

773
01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:27.830
<i>The Red Queen does not
tolerate disobedience.</i>

774
01:19:27.864 --> 01:19:29.332
<i>Off with your head.</i>

775
01:19:30.567 --> 01:19:33.537
<i>We will make a lady
of you yet.</i>

776
01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:40.009
Alice!

777
01:19:46.650 --> 01:19:48.985
It's not time to grow up. Alice.

778
01:19:51.455 --> 01:19:53.156
It never is.

779
01:19:55.024 --> 01:19:56.427
Peter?

780
01:19:57.428 --> 01:19:58.895
You'll see.

781
01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:15.011
<i>I shall be too late.</i>

782
01:20:32.929 --> 01:20:36.265
<i>Long ago. in a faraway land.</i>

783
01:20:38.569 --> 01:20:40.437
<i>there was a family.</i>

784
01:20:42.271 --> 01:20:45.409
<i>By day. the children did
as they were told.</i>

785
01:20:50.681 --> 01:20:54.618
<i>and in the innermost places
of their hearts.</i>

786
01:20:54.651 --> 01:20:58.087
<i>they worried about
what it might mean to grow up.</i>

787
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:19.275
<i>But at night. when their
hearts lay still and sleeping.</i>

788
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:24.448
<i>their golden dream dust
filled the room</i>

789
01:21:25.416 --> 01:21:28.985
<i>and took them far. far away.</i>

790
01:22:02.486 --> 01:22:04.020
Come home.

791
01:22:30.481 --> 01:22:32.649
Catch me if you can.

792
01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:07.276
<i>I was
only a visitor in Wonderland.</i>

793
01:24:09.913 --> 01:24:12.482
<i>Take care of Peter. Tink.</i>

794
01:24:14.183 --> 01:24:17.554
<i>But Peter
was born to be Pan.</i>

795
01:24:29.633 --> 01:24:31.568
It's brilliant.

796
01:24:47.851 --> 01:24:50.152
Oh. my baby.

797
01:24:59.195 --> 01:25:01.465
- I love you.
- I love you too.

798
01:25:38.267 --> 01:25:41.404
<i>We always knew
when he'd been to visit...</i>

799
01:25:43.974 --> 01:25:47.276
<i>Because he'd leave us
a piece of his adventures.</i>

800
01:26:03.359 --> 01:26:04.594
Rose?

801
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:08.665
<i>The world fresh</i>

802
01:26:08.699 --> 01:26:12.201
<i>and full of possibilities
once again.</i>

803
01:26:20.010 --> 01:26:23.980
"For he comes. human child

804
01:26:24.014 --> 01:26:26.516
"To the woods and waters wild

805
01:26:27.349 --> 01:26:30.587
"With a faery. hand in hand

806
01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:34.791
"for the world's more full of
weeping than he can understand."

807
01:26:44.634 --> 01:26:46.870
Mama. what's wrong?

808
01:26:52.943 --> 01:26:54.444
Nothing. Wendy.

809
01:26:56.079 --> 01:26:57.614
Nothing at all.

810
01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:01.885
You look lovely. Alice.

811
01:27:31.915 --> 01:27:34.818
<i>I don't remember
the way to the rabbit hole.</i>

812
01:27:37.654 --> 01:27:40.757
<i>or the smell
of Neverland's shores...</i>

813
01:27:57.007 --> 01:27:59.442
<i>But because of my brothers.</i>

814
01:28:02.712 --> 01:28:05.448
<i>I haven't forgotten
how to dream.</i>
