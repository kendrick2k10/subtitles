341
00:24:30.606 --> 00:24:31.737
and you're bluffing now.

342
00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:33.312
I'm not bluffing. I promise you.

343
00:24:33.414 --> 00:24:35.307
But you do what you want.
I'm good.

344
00:24:35.409 --> 00:24:39.112
-So you want me to call you?
-Either way is good for me.

345
00:24:45.892 --> 00:24:52.994
Well. this is probably idiotic.
but. um... yeah. fuck it. call.

346
00:24:57.368 --> 00:24:58.466
Yeah. I thought so.

347
00:24:58.568 --> 00:24:59.701
ERIC: Why did you... What?

348
00:24:59.803 --> 00:25:01.306
Why are you calling my bet
on the flop?

349
00:25:01.408 --> 00:25:03.307
You thought your sevens
were ahead

350
00:25:03.409 --> 00:25:04.738
after this giant bet I made?

351
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.373
MAN: I don't know. man.
It was...

352
00:25:06.475 --> 00:25:08.680
It was stupid.

353
00:25:10.578 --> 00:25:11.844
(MAN LAUGHS)

354
00:25:11.946 --> 00:25:14.045

-MAN: Shit.

355
00:25:14.147 --> 00:25:16.520
-WOMAN: OK.
-MAN: All right. yeah.

356
00:25:16.622 --> 00:25:20.091
-Fucking A.
-WOMAN: Nice. (LAUGHS)

357
00:25:20.193 --> 00:25:21.988
Wow. Well. I... Hey.

358
00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.158
-I'm... I'm really sorry. man.
-That was...

359
00:25:26.298 --> 00:25:27.762
That did not happen.

360
00:25:27.864 --> 00:25:30.201
That was a good game.
It's just luck.

361
00:25:30.303 --> 00:25:31.370
It doesn't make any sense.

362
00:25:31.472 --> 00:25:32.636
Why did you call my bet
on the flop?

363
00:25:32.738 --> 00:25:34.403
I had the sevens
and then I had the feeling

364
00:25:34.505 --> 00:25:35.738
that you were bluffing.

365
00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:37.869
Because I wanted you to think
I was bluffing.

366
00:25:37.972 --> 00:25:41.112
Well. it worked.
and I got lucky.

367
00:25:41.214 --> 00:25:42.206
That's a bad call.

368
00:25:42.308 --> 00:25:43.746
You're not supposed
to make the all-in call.

369
00:25:43.849 --> 00:25:45.745
Josh does stupid shit like that
all the time.

370
00:25:45.847 --> 00:25:47.182
It usually works out for him.

371
00:25:47.285 --> 00:25:49.182
JOSH: OK.

372
00:25:53.593 --> 00:25:57.729
Tough break. bro.
Sorry about that.

373
00:26:00.901 --> 00:26:03.127
Why was he even in that hand?
With a three and a seven?

374
00:26:03.229 --> 00:26:05.470
Why did he even call
my pre-flop raise?

375
00:26:05.572 --> 00:26:07.504
DENNIS: You placed third
and cashed out.

376
00:26:07.606 --> 00:26:09.305
I never get a chance
to cash out.

377
00:26:09.407 --> 00:26:11.611
You should be happy.

378
00:26:16.044 --> 00:26:17.648
Can we play again
when you're done?

379
00:26:17.751 --> 00:26:19.913
Uh. you know what. man?
We really can't tonight.

380
00:26:20.015 --> 00:26:22.953
I told my wife
it wouldn't be too late.

381
00:26:23.055 --> 00:26:25.516
-Can we play again tomorrow?
-Aren't you leaving tomorrow?

382
00:26:25.618 --> 00:26:28.120
I'll change my flight. I have
elite status with the airline.

383
00:26:28.223 --> 00:26:30.328
so I don't have
to worry about rebooking fees.

384
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:31.761
Man. you... you're just on tilt.

385
00:26:31.863 --> 00:26:33.796
Yeah. maybe just. you know.
take a moment.

386
00:26:33.898 --> 00:26:36.501
Relax. Rethink it.
Go back to the hotel.

387
00:26:36.603 --> 00:26:37.930
and if you think
you still want to stay.

388
00:26:38.032 --> 00:26:39.469
we can all come
and talk about it.

389
00:26:39.571 --> 00:26:41.540
Do I look like I'm not calm?

390
00:26:41.642 --> 00:26:43.068
DENNIS: You're not even
a little bit upset?

391
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.704
This is just me knowing
that I can win

392
00:26:44.806 --> 00:26:46.641
and wanting to play again.

393
00:26:46.743 --> 00:26:47.941
I don't care about the money.

394
00:26:48.043 --> 00:26:49.677
I just don't have to pay
rebooking fees.

395
00:26:49.779 --> 00:26:51.849
so it's easy for me to stay.

396
00:26:51.951 --> 00:26:54.918
I'd be willing to play again
if everybody else is.

-WOMAN: Yeah. she is. Um...

398

-ERIC: Can I talk to her?
-WOMAN: OK.

399
00:27:21.843 --> 00:27:23.110
I just opened the door

400
00:27:23.212 --> 00:27:25.316
and there's a man outside
coming up the steps.

401
00:27:25.418 --> 00:27:27.687
He says he's here for you.

402
00:27:34.689 --> 00:27:36.696
Who was that?

403
00:27:37.731 --> 00:27:42.100
Just someone
my roommate is sleeping with.

404
00:27:42.202 --> 00:27:44.503

405
00:27:44.605 --> 00:27:47.638
This is the best.
Why did you stay?

406
00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.440
I just re-thought it
and I just decided

407
00:27:49.542 --> 00:27:50.674
that we didn't have enough time.

408
00:27:50.776 --> 00:27:52.607
so I changed my flight
to tomorrow.

409
00:27:52.709 --> 00:27:54.307

410
00:27:55.578 --> 00:27:57.310

you're still here?

Southern Utah. in the desert.

00:31:44.337 --> 00:31:46.140
He's a river-rafting guide.

460
00:31:46.242 --> 00:31:49.811
so he'd teach me
how to raft down a river

461
00:31:49.913 --> 00:31:52.984
and I can become a guide.

462
00:31:53.086 --> 00:31:56.956

that come into town.

00:35:12.683 --> 00:35:16.518
-Maybe she had a panic attack.
-Does Maggie have panic attacks?

513
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.221
I thought you talked to her
on the phone sometimes.

514
00:35:19.323 --> 00:35:21.518
Yeah. but she never
told me that.

515
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.595
Why is she having panic attacks?

516
00:35:23.697 --> 00:35:25.692
Just normal anxiety.

517
00:35:33.607 --> 00:35:35.873
Do you not...

518
00:35:35.975 --> 00:35:38.309
-have panic attacks?
-No.

519
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.643
Well. since you don't keep up
on the books.

520
00:35:44.745 --> 00:35:47.445
both of your sisters
have panic attacks.

521
00:35:47.547 --> 00:35:49.450
your mother had panic attacks.

522
00:35:49.552 --> 00:35:51.889
maybe even your father
had panic attacks.

523
00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:53.290
although nobody would know that

524
00:35:53.392 --> 00:35:55.588
because he never confessed
to any other living soul

525
00:35:55.691 --> 00:35:58.659
about what was going on
inside his mind or body.

526
00:36:01.901 --> 00:36:03.335
So consider yourself lucky

527
00:36:03.437 --> 00:36:06.898
to have skipped the genetic
chopping block on that one.

528
00:36:11.774 --> 00:36:16.347

You need to go see your friends?

536
00:36:46.676 --> 00:36:50.015

537

and you feed us

538
00:36:51.578 --> 00:36:52.844
minutes and hours at your will.

539
00:36:52.946 --> 00:36:55.920
like giving tiny breadcrumbs
to starving mice.

540
00:36:56.022 --> 00:36:57.484
and it breaks her little heart.

541
00:36:57.586 --> 00:37:00.259
She thinks she needs you
for some reason.

542
00:37:03.263 --> 00:37:05.226

You being like this?

543
00:37:05.328 --> 00:37:07.530
-Being like what?
-Mean.

544
00:37:10.168 --> 00:37:11.634
Haven't I always been like this?

545
00:37:11.736 --> 00:37:15.671
No. You've been funny and witty
and cynical about the world.

546

this bitter. not like this.

547

00:47:26.951 --> 00:47:29.784
Earlier when we were
with everybody

684
00:47:29.886 --> 00:47:33.056
and I did the. uh. radio voice

685
00:47:33.158 --> 00:47:36.895
about the earthquake
and the baby. you didn't laugh.

686
00:47:37.596 --> 00:47:39.293
Nobody else did either.

687
00:47:40.699 --> 00:47:43.033
Was it because of my delivery?

688
00:47:45.569 --> 00:47:47.367
I don't know.

689
00:47:47.469 --> 00:47:51.910
Or was it in comparison
with what Rachel was saying?

690
00:47:54.544 --> 00:47:56.046
Maybe.

691
00:48:05.884 --> 00:48:09.191
You used to think I was the
funniest person in the world.

692
00:48:18.433 --> 00:48:21.404
You're really not going
to stay another night?

693
00:48:21.506 --> 00:48:23.073
Probably not.

694
00:48:38.085 --> 00:48:41.250
I think I was. like. six.

695
00:48:41.352 --> 00:48:42.585
My mom was cooking dinner

696
00:48:42.688 --> 00:48:45.260
and she sliced her finger open
with a knife.

697
00:48:45.362 --> 00:48:48.197
I saw all the blood and I saw
how freaked out she was.

698
00:48:48.299 --> 00:48:51.065
Like. there was a real look
of terror on her face.

699
00:48:51.167 --> 00:48:52.596
Her finger was dangling
the wrong way.

700
00:48:52.698 --> 00:48:54.798
She went to the hospital.
she got it stitched up.

701
00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:59.303
but I totally thought she was
gonna die while she was there.

702
00:48:59.405 --> 00:49:01.206
-Good hand.
-ERIC: Thank you.

703
00:49:01.308 --> 00:49:03.345
DENNIS:
And what about you. Eric?

704
00:49:03.447 --> 00:49:08.115
First time you realized that
death exists and people die.

705
00:49:08.217 --> 00:49:09.814
ERIC:
That's what we're talking about?

706
00:49:09.916 --> 00:49:11.550
Yeah.

707
00:49:13.425 --> 00:49:14.993
Um...

708
00:49:17.295 --> 00:49:22.528
I remember... there was
this father and son I once knew.

709
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:27.104
And. uh. the father was.
like. pretty high up in status.

710
00:49:27.206 --> 00:49:30.841
like. he had most of the power
in their community.

711
00:49:30.943 --> 00:49:32.942
And the father
was planning on the son

712
00:49:33.044 --> 00:49:34.838
taking over for him.
for the father.

713
00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:38.146
like. taking over what you
could call the family business.

714
00:49:38.248 --> 00:49:42.112
But the son's uncle.
the father's brother.

715
00:49:42.214 --> 00:49:44.581
he wanted the power.

716
00:49:44.683 --> 00:49:48.758
He was jealous and mean.
the uncle. and...

717
00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.887
so the evil uncle made a trap

718
00:49:50.989 --> 00:49:55.932
cornering the father in this.
like. canyon. in a canyon.

719
00:49:56.034 --> 00:49:58.569
where there was
a stampede of antelope.

720
00:49:58.671 --> 00:49:59.629
-Antelope?
-ERIC: Yeah.

721
00:49:59.731 --> 00:50:02.699
Like. very strong antelope
or strong deer.

722
00:50:02.801 --> 00:50:05.074
I don't know. But animals
that look like antelope.

723
00:50:05.176 --> 00:50:07.010
and the father was trapped
and he was hurt.

724
00:50:07.112 --> 00:50:11.313
and he tried
to climb up the canyon wall.

725
00:50:12.916 --> 00:50:14.646
But the uncle was there.

726
00:50:17.121 --> 00:50:21.653
Uh. he didn't let the father
climb up.

727
00:50:23.158 --> 00:50:25.125
He. uh... And the father fell.

728
00:50:25.227 --> 00:50:28.198
He fell back down
into the canyon.

729
00:50:29.062 --> 00:50:31.069
And. um...

730
00:50:32.431 --> 00:50:35.238
He. uh... That's how he died.

731
00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:39.842
And the son. he went down there
wondering what happened.

732
00:50:39.944 --> 00:50:41.738
and he found his father dead.

733
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.308
The son was so sad.
he was trying to understand

734
00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:46.348
what happened to his father.

735
00:50:48.781 --> 00:50:52.090
And understand
why his father wasn't moving.

736
00:50:53.156 --> 00:50:57.095
Um. and his father
was indeed dead.

737
00:50:58.294 --> 00:51:01.060
And that was the first time
I realized

738
00:51:01.162 --> 00:51:03.563
that sometimes. lions die.

739
00:51:05.472 --> 00:51:06.938

740
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.701

you're crazy.

00:51:11.138 --> 00:51:13.771

742
00:51:14.539 --> 00:51:15.811
JOSH: Wait. I... I don't get it.

743
00:51:15.913 --> 00:51:17.675
What's going on? What?

744
00:51:17.777 --> 00:51:21.310
The son that found
the father dead. that was Simba

745
00:51:21.412 --> 00:51:23.346
from<i> The Lion King.</i>

746
00:51:23.448 --> 00:51:24.681
Like. the Disney movie?

747
00:51:24.784 --> 00:51:28.159
-WOMAN: Yeah.
-JOSH: All right. OK. I get it.

748
00:51:28.261 --> 00:51:30.689
Like. you got us. man.
You got us pretty good there.

749
00:51:30.791 --> 00:51:33.161
That's really the first time
you realized people die?

750
00:51:33.263 --> 00:51:35.061
Yeah. that tore me apart.
that scene.

751
00:51:35.163 --> 00:51:36.430
Basically traumatized me.

752
00:51:36.532 --> 00:51:39.095
I guess you could say
it<i> scarred </i> me for life.

753
00:51:39.197 --> 00:51:41.432
(LAUGHS)

754
00:51:41.534 --> 00:51:43.806
Scar is the name
of the evil uncle.

755
00:51:43.908 --> 00:51:45.501
Eric was scarred for life.

756
00:51:45.604 --> 00:51:47.673
-I got you. All right.
-Yeah.

757
00:51:47.775 --> 00:51:50.607
-Why were you crying?
-I was trying to sell it to you.

758
00:51:50.709 --> 00:51:52.281
I was trying to sell the story
to you.

759
00:51:52.383 --> 00:51:54.445
DENNIS: Well. you sold it.
I almost cried too.

760
00:51:54.547 --> 00:51:57.749
-WOMAN: Hilarious.
-JOSH: Wow.

761
00:52:02.155 --> 00:52:04.756
(WATER RUNS)

762
00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.938
Eric. I don't think
you'd do half bad

763
00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.571
in another game I play in.

764
00:52:19.673 --> 00:52:22.345
It's a bigger game.
Cash game. good players.

765
00:52:22.447 --> 00:52:24.414
Three times a week. and there's
a game tomorrow night.

766
00:52:24.516 --> 00:52:29.213
I probably play twice a month.
if I feel like I can afford it.

767
00:52:29.315 --> 00:52:30.380
What's the buy-in?

768
00:52:30.482 --> 00:52:31.682
I don't think it'd be wise

769
00:52:31.784 --> 00:52:33.289
to start with anything less
than a hundred.

770
00:52:33.391 --> 00:52:35.787
But you're better off
with. like. two or three.

771
00:52:37.793 --> 00:52:41.691
I should be going home. finally.
But that's tempting. for sure.

772
00:52:41.793 --> 00:52:44.427
All right. If you
change your mind.

of some sort.

he was going home before.
