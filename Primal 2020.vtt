Oh. man. What you doin'. man?

10
00:00:51.772 --> 00:00:54.189
- I'm just looking at myself.

11
00:00:55.432 --> 00:00:57.182
That's all I'm doing.

12
00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:01.926
Look. man.

13
00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:06.813
I don't think I'm gonna
make it to your party.

14
00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:08.210
Okay?
- Just fuckin'. just fuckin'-

15
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.293

17
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.863
Where is she. Blake?

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.880
Yeah. yeah. What's up. bro?

24
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.763
Yeah. party's next week. 19th.

Uh-huh.

26
00:02:00.743 --> 00:02:03.250
I don't care who you bring.
bro. Just bring somebody.

27
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.873
Yeah. look at her. man.
- Wow. Amber Star.

28
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.200
Not bad.
- Bro. you're tellin' me.

29
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.033
I mean...

30
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.770
If I had a shot at that pussy.

31
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.593
fuckin'. I'd just end her life.

32
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.223
- All right. well. look.

33
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.320
- Oh. yo! Good looks. thank you.

34
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.313

37
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.603
Dude. are you serious? Come pick that up.

38
00:03:00.644 --> 00:03:02.300
- Are you serious? It's not
gonna make a fuckin' difference.

39
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.430
You seen this place?

40
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.700
- Yeah. none of this shit's mine.

41
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.743
- Bullshit.

42
00:03:08.176 --> 00:03:09.350
What about that?
- What about what?

43
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.700
- That! Did you see that?
- That's definitely not mine!

44
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.490
- [Blake] Bullshit. man!
It's next to your bed!

45
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.430
- Oh. my god. dude.

46
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.620
Just pick up whatever you
think is yours then. okay?

47
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.280
I'm not getting into semantics.

48
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.370
- Bro. that's definitely
not how you use that word.

49
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.813
- I don't give a shit!
Just grab your stuff!

50
00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:26.213
(Blake groans)

51
00:03:26.213 --> 00:03:27.113

52
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.033
God!

53
00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:32.514
Man. fuckin'...

54
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.003
- Dude. what are you. fuckin' five?

55
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.090
What are you doing? Grab a...

56
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.380
Get a storage container and
fucking organize your shit!

57
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.670
- It's my fucking bed! I can
put whatever the fuck I want-

58
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.000
- It's hanging out! That's the solution?

59
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.370
- I'll push it harder! I'll
shove it in there. all right?

60
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.290
- You're an animal.
- Fuck you. man.

61
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.690
- [Arlo] Just hoardin' shit.

62
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.460
- [Blake] You see? That's fuckin' perfect.

63
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.153
Fuckin' spic and span.

64
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.310
Fuck you.
- Oh. my god. whatever.

65
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.203
If I can't see it...

66
00:04:11.203 --> 00:04:12.605
Actually. you know what? I can see it!

67
00:04:12.605 --> 00:04:13.921
- [Blake] Fuckin' suck my...

68
00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:17.421

82
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.740
- Fuck this yogurt.
(Arlo chuckles)

83
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.030
It's not funny.

84
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.510
I'm so tired. I was up like all night.

85
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.660
- Why?

86
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.833
- Nothing. Why do you
have just a pineapple?

87
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.750
- Well. you know what
they say about pineapples.

88
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.570
- No. I don't. What do they say?

89
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.470
- Um. never mind. I shouldn't
have asked you that.

90
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.883
Stupid.
- Okay. weirdo.

91
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.560
- [Arlo] And like your frat
parties. it's like a big wave

92
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.450
of seaweed just kind of
flowing back and forth.

93
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.260
I think it's kinda funny.
- Yeah. dude. for sure.

94
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.790
Dude. it's gonna be so
grimy. I love that shit.

95
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.560
- Yeah.
- Oh. one more thing.

96
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.463
I gotta tell you.

97
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.520
I'm not going over to
Alice's place tonight.

98
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.283
Her roommate got like real
sick. She got like the mumps.

99
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.070
Change of plans. she's gonna
come over here instead.

100
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.774
Is it cool if you leave
just for a little bit?

101
00:05:42.774 --> 00:05:44.425
- Oh. bro. Again?

102
00:05:44.425 --> 00:05:47.675
(brooding piano music)

103
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.983
- What's the problem?

104
00:06:11.016 --> 00:06:11.849
- Nothing.

105
00:06:13.548 --> 00:06:15.770
We should talk about it later.

106
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.840
- Alice. if there's a problem.

107
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.440
I wanna talk about it right now.

108
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.890
- Well...

109
00:06:22.828 --> 00:06:26.050
I don't know I feel like we've
been staying in a lot lately.

110
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.570
I'm just getting antsy. I feel
it'd be really great for us

111
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.595
to go out and do something instead.

112
00:06:30.595 --> 00:06:32.670
(Blake groans)

113
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.700
- Alice. what do you want from me?

114
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.940
- Take her bowling.
- Bowling!

115
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.680
- I don't know. fuckin' take her food-

116
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.120
- Bro. you know I don't
do that sappy shit. man.

117
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.440
I don't fuck with it.
- It's not sappy!

118
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.280
- It is! I don't-
- It's real dating stuff.

119
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.785
- I want flowers. (chuckles)

120
00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:50.563
I want to go out to eat.

121
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.800
I wanna be friends who

122
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.063
happened to fall in love.

123
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.290
- What did you have in mind? (sighs)

124
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.050
- It's called Cupcake Castle.
- Oh. Alice.

125
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.080
- No. no. No. listen.

126
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.900
It's this little cafe
that looks like a castle.

127
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.540
and they only sell little
cupcakes that are one of a kind.

128
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.990
I mean. they make them
right there to order for you

129
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.480
at your table like a clown
who makes balloon animals

130
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.570
for little kids.
(Blake sighs)

131
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.423
Doesn't that... Doesn't
that sound like fun?

132
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.660
I just feel like you don't know

133
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.160
what these cupcakes look like.

134
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:28.955
- No. no.
- Let me show you.

135
00:07:28.955 --> 00:07:32.545
- Alice. I wouldn't...
(actress moans sexually)

136
00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:36.063
- [Actress] (gasps) Oh. yeah.

137
00:07:36.063 --> 00:07:37.330
- Is this porn?

138
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.706
- [Blake] It's really
not a big deal. Alice.

139
00:07:38.706 --> 00:07:39.767
- You have porn on your laptop.

140
00:07:39.767 --> 00:07:41.775
- Just fucking close the laptop.
all right? Just close it.

141
00:07:41.775 --> 00:07:43.910
(actress moans sexually)

142
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.700
- [Arlo] Shit. Oh. sorry.

143
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.073
- Arlo! What the fuck. man?

144
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.123
- I'm sorry.
- Oh. what're you doing?

145
00:07:52.225 --> 00:07:54.820
- I'm just coming back home.

146
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.014
- Dude. what'd you... What
the fuck happened. man?

147
00:07:58.014 --> 00:07:59.490
You don't make any god damn sense. man.

148
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.923
- Of course you don't
fucking get it. Blake!

149
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.383
You have somebody!

150
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.783
You have Alice. man. Where's my somebody?

151
00:08:09.843 --> 00:08:13.343
(somber orchestral music)

152
00:08:20.761 --> 00:08:23.291
I don't know her name.

153
00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:26.230
and I don't know what she's like.

154
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.813
but I'm gonna find her one day.

155
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:32.414
I'm gonna find her.

156
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.103
- So. um. I gotta talk
to you about tonight.

157
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:42.900
- Yeah. what about?

158
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.330
- Well...

159
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.743
- No.

160
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.150
Nope.

161
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.680
She's not coming over.

162
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.120
- Bro. that's not fucking fair.

163
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.710
- You know what's not fair?

164
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.310
That I gotta fuckin' leave
the house every single night.

165
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.340
- You told me that I could
have the apartment last night.

166
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.980
And then you come fuckin'
busting through the door?

167
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.640
- Dude. I left and came back hours later!

168
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.350
- No. you came back trashed as shit.

169
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.710
You almost broke the door down.

170
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.157
- So what? I left!

171
00:09:14.157 --> 00:09:16.740
- "So what?" That's
not fucking cool. dude.

172
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.090
- I gave you your time.

173
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.400
- Bro!

174
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.380
Look. I already texted
her. She's coming over.

175
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.980
- I gotta leave right now?

176
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.773
- If you would be so kind.
get your ass out that door.

177
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.670
(door creaks)

178
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.140
(birds tweet)

179
00:09:43.253 --> 00:09:46.170
(distant laughter)

180
00:09:49.487 --> 00:09:53.237
(distant yelps and laughter)

181
00:10:01.825 --> 00:10:05.080
- Stop! (yelps) Oh. my god!

182
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.063
- [Ally] Get a room!

183
00:10:07.617 --> 00:10:10.785
(Maggie yelps)

184
00:10:10.785 --> 00:10:12.035
- Jesus.
- Wait.

185
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.690
Who's...

186
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:15.533
- What the fuck?

187
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.396
Oh. shit. Cam! Cam!

188
00:10:18.396 --> 00:10:19.229
- No.

189
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.590
- That's not-
- Who is that?

190
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.893
- No. that's definitely not Cam.

191
00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:35.170
- [Arlo] Who are you?

192
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.780
- Hi. I'm Maggie. It's nice to meet you.

193
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.423
- I'm Arlo. Nice to meet you.
- I'm Ally.

194
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.103
- Ally.

195
00:10:43.488 --> 00:10:44.330
So what're you guys doin'?

196
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:45.630
- Oh. you know. we're just foolin'.

197
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.350
- This is Elijah.
- Hey. how's it going. man?

198
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.477
- Hey.
- What're you doin'?

199
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.878
- [Arlo] I'm just going for a walk.

200
00:10:53.878 --> 00:10:56.060
- In the middle of the street?

201
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.158
- Truthfully. it's a little
dark on the sidewalk. so I just-

202
00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:01.067
- (sighs) Are you afraid of the dark?

203
00:11:01.067 --> 00:11:04.020
- No. I'm not afraid of the dark.

204
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.230
but all these fucking people have dogs.

205
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.140
and they just jump out at
you at the most random times.

206
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.689
- Like...

207
00:11:12.689 --> 00:11:14.689
(barks) Like that?
(Elijah laughs)

208
00:11:14.689 --> 00:11:17.057
- Oh. get him!
(Arlo chuckles)

209
00:11:17.057 --> 00:11:20.150
- That's what I'm
talkin' about. (chuckles)

210
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.530
So what're you guys doin'?
- Oh. we're going to a party.

211
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.530
- Well. you know. not like a party-party.

212
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.097
- It's like a concert.
- It's a house concert.

213
00:11:27.097 --> 00:11:28.570
One of our friends is throwing a show

214
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.230
for the band Dead Rat Ass?

215
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.063
- You've probably never heard of 'em.

216
00:11:31.063 --> 00:11:32.083
- Well. he may have.

217
00:11:34.297 --> 00:11:35.750
- "Dead Rat Ass"?

218
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.945
- [Ally] Yeah.

219
00:11:36.945 --> 00:11:38.395
- (chuckles) Are you serious?

220
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.100
Yeah. No. that sounds awful.

221
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.290
- No.

222
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.010
No. not terrible.

223
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.140
They're awesome. Their music is so sick.

224
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.523
It's like. it's such a good mosh.

225
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.518
Come on.
- Hey. hey.

226
00:11:52.518 --> 00:11:54.158
Come on. ease up on-
- You want me to come?

227
00:11:54.158 --> 00:11:56.308
- He's new. he's new.
- Do you wanna come?

228
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.539
- I'm down for a good mosh. Is that cool?

229
00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:01.620
- Onward!

230
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.750
- All right. all right. Easy now.

231
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.979
- Why are you out here anyways?

232
00:12:05.979 --> 00:12:07.470
- Oh.

233
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.739
All right. fine. I get
sexiled all the time.

234
00:12:09.739 --> 00:12:11.607
(Ally chuckles)

235
00:12:11.607 --> 00:12:12.440
- Ah. "sexiled."

236
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.050
- My roommate got a new girlfriend.

237
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:18.920
and he begs me to leave and I
just for some stupid reason.

238
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.530
I say yes.

239
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.510
- Well-
- I guess I'm a nice guy.

240
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.690
- Guess so. It's a good thing. though.

241
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.793
Because. if not. you wouldn't
be able to see Dead Rat Ass.

242
00:12:29.734 --> 00:12:31.020
(Arlo chuckles)

243
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.670
- I guess there is a bright side.

244
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.440
- It's good to meet you. Arlo.

245
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.780
- It's good to meet you. too.

246
00:12:41.486 --> 00:12:44.986

(Ally chuckles)

257
00:13:53.504 --> 00:13:54.593
- Hey.

258
00:13:54.593 --> 00:13:57.187
Could I get one of those?

259
00:13:57.187 --> 00:13:59.050
- Maybe you can come over to my place

260
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.797
and I can show you some of my art?

261
00:14:02.766 --> 00:14:03.683

264
00:14:13.296 --> 00:14:16.186
- Easy there.
(Maggie chuckles)

265
00:14:16.186 --> 00:14:17.276
(slap)
(yells) Fuck!

266
00:14:17.276 --> 00:14:19.538
- Are you fucking-
- God damn it. Maggie!

267
00:14:19.538 --> 00:14:20.371
- Are you kidding me?
- What the fuck?

268
00:14:20.371 --> 00:14:22.390
- You have been so grabby all night!

269
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.280
Don't fucking yell at me!
- So grabby?

270
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.390
So grabby? You smacked me
in the face. first of all.

271
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:28.110
- Yeah. I did. 'cause you grabbed my butt!

272
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.356
- I touched you twice!
- Oh. thank you so much!

273
00:14:31.356 --> 00:14:33.276
What a hero!
- Didn't say a goddamn thing!

274
00:14:33.276 --> 00:14:34.850
- I didn't say a goddamn...
Well. okay. okay.

275
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.520
What gave you the
impression that I wanted you

276
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.890
to grab my body with
your grubby little hands?

277
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.250
- All fucking night. Maggie!

278
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.610
- All fucking night doing what?

279
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.560
- Looking at me. grabbing
me on the dance floor.

280
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.030
- Oh. my god. we had a
conversation and we moshed!

281
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.760
You're just like every other fucking guy!

282
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.447
- Really? And you're like every
girl turning it back around-

283
00:14:52.447 --> 00:14:54.313
- What's going on?
Maggie. what's going on?

284
00:14:54.313 --> 00:14:58.100
- He just grabbed my ass.
- Oh. my god. Elijah!

285
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.247
Why? Why can't you control yourself. ever?

286
00:15:00.247 --> 00:15:02.168
- Fuck off. Ally. Fuck off!

287
00:15:02.168 --> 00:15:03.608
You saw that there was
stuff happening between us.

288
00:15:03.608 --> 00:15:05.436
- Dude. come on. We've talked about this.

289
00:15:05.436 --> 00:15:06.495
- We have not talked about this!

290
00:15:06.495 --> 00:15:08.767
- You grabbed her ass
multiple times tonight-

291
00:15:08.767 --> 00:15:10.727
- No. I have not!
- Yes. you have.

292
00:15:10.727 --> 00:15:12.493
- Don't you give me this bullshit. Ally.

293
00:15:12.493 --> 00:15:14.313
(talking over each other)
(chaotic animal sounds)

294
00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:16.562
- Then see if he likes it. Fuck you!

295
00:15:16.562 --> 00:15:18.564
Fuck you! No. Ally. I am so ready...

296
00:15:18.564 --> 00:15:21.053
(talking over each other)
(chaotic animal sounds)

297
00:15:21.053 --> 00:15:23.423
I don't have to do it. I got this.

298
00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:25.404
Ally. I need this!
- Maggie. stop!

299
00:15:25.404 --> 00:15:26.571
- I need this.

300
00:15:27.495 --> 00:15:28.662
- [Ally] Okay.

301
00:15:43.185 --> 00:15:45.713
(Maggie chuckles)

302
00:15:45.713 --> 00:15:46.546
- You know what?

303
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:49.793
You're not worth it.

304
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.390
You just don't fucking get it.

305
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.603
- No. I don't fucking get it. Maggie.

306
00:15:56.533 --> 00:15:58.030
(Maggie sighs)

307
00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.273
- You are a weak. weak man.

308
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.433
- Fuck off.
(gorilla grunts)

309
00:16:08.433 --> 00:16:10.377
Get the. get the fuck out.

310
00:16:11.425 --> 00:16:14.175
(gorilla grunts)

311
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.900
- Look. I'm sorry about
all that back there.

312
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.890
Elijah usually is an asshole. so.

313
00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.180
actually. that wasn't a surprise.

314
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.572
- I wasn't that surprised.

315
00:16:30.572 --> 00:16:32.330
(Ally chuckles)

316
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.520
I'm just saying.

317
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.353
- Yeah.

318
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.333
Maggie. I'm sorry.

319
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.790
- I didn't think he'd be
like that. but he was. so-

320
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.730
- He's a dick and a loser

321
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.203
and we don't need him.

322
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.673
- Yeah.

323
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.670
You know. whatever. I don't care.

324
00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.000
- Hey. do you guys wanna come

325
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.723
back to my place for a little bit?

326
00:17:03.533 --> 00:17:04.530
- I would-
- It's pretty cool.

327
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:05.583
- I would love it.
- Okay.

328
00:17:05.583 --> 00:17:07.670
- That cool?
- Yeah. definitely.

329
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:08.850
Definitely. You?

330
00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.850
- Yeah. let's cheer her up a little bit.

331
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:14.160
- It's gonna be okay.
- Not all men are assholes.

332
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.160
- That's true.
- Just saying.

333
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.893
- Are you an asshole?

334
00:17:16.893 --> 00:17:18.420
- No.
- We'll see. We'll find out.

335
00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.850
- I am not an asshole.
- All right. Arlo.

336
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.282
- We'll see. We're gonna
get you to stop smoking.

337
00:17:23.282 --> 00:17:25.052
- Hey. I like the way you say my name.

338
00:17:25.052 --> 00:17:27.487
- (chuckles) Oh. really?
(Arlo moans)

339
00:17:27.487 --> 00:17:29.420
- All right. fine.

340
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.300
- Yes.

341
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.593
Step one.
- No. just kidding.

342
00:17:36.871 --> 00:17:38.038
- Here we are.

343
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.740
Maggie. do you want a glass of water?

344
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.197
- Yeah. that'd be great. thanks.

345
00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.735
(water splashes)

346
00:17:57.353 --> 00:17:59.214
That's great.

347
00:17:59.214 --> 00:18:02.214
(suspenseful music)

348
00:18:08.511 --> 00:18:10.690
(Ally chuckles)

349
00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.223
- I made that little bird. You like it?

350
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.420
- No way.

351
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.253
- [Ally] Yeah.

352
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:20.190
- What else did you make here?

353
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.040
- Every single thing. except...

354
00:18:25.783 --> 00:18:26.616
That one.

355
00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:35.122
- [Arlo] Why? What's this one?

356
00:18:35.122 --> 00:18:38.340
- A guy I used to know made that for me.

357
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.263
He was obsessed with that style of art.

358
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.960
He gave it to me to remember him by.

359
00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:47.443
- You make it sound like he's dead.

360
00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.223
- Anyway. he was a terrible kisser.

361
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:09.810
Come sit next to me.

362
00:19:22.521 --> 00:19:25.271
(leather creaks)

363
00:19:32.859 --> 00:19:35.609
(leather creaks)

364
00:19:44.376 --> 00:19:47.126
(leather creaks)

365
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.820
(leather creaks)

366
00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.160
- [Maggie] Goodnight. guys!

367
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.460
- Oh. goodnight.

368
00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.610
Let me know if you need anything.

369
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.440
Do you wanna get some sleep?

370
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.993
- Yeah. I should. I have work tomorrow.

371
00:20:33.919 --> 00:20:34.752
- Okay.

372
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.800
I'm gonna go get a blanket.

373
00:20:46.601 --> 00:20:49.739
Is it cool if I get the lights?

374
00:20:49.739 --> 00:20:50.822
- Yeah. sure.

375
00:20:52.921 --> 00:20:55.421
(waves crash)

376
00:20:57.481 --> 00:21:00.814
(brooding string music)

377
00:21:30.817 --> 00:21:34.317
(animals grunt and growl)

378
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.023
- Blake?

379
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.163
I think you owe me an explanation.

380
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.253
- About what?

381
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.673
- Why you had porn on your laptop.

382
00:22:24.023 --> 00:22:26.420
(Blake chuckles)

383
00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.333
- Why do you think I
had porn on my laptop?

384
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.230
- Am I not enough for you?

385
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.460
- Alice. come on. Don't go there.

386
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.140
You know you're more than enough for me.

387
00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.500
- Then. then take me to Cupcake Castle.

388
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.920
- [Blake] Stop with the fuckin'
Cupcake Castle. all right?

389
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.320
It's probably too expensive.

390
00:22:52.761 --> 00:22:55.780
(knife lightly thuds)

391
00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.613
- Look at me.

392
00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.603
Blake?

393
00:23:01.503 --> 00:23:03.160
(knife clacks)
(Blake sighs)

394
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.460
You haven't even tried to make me happy.

395
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.810
- What do you want me to do?
- Love me!

396
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.610
Or anything more than the
passionless sex I have to endure.

397
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:13.542
and then to find that you
were looking at other women.

398
00:23:13.542 --> 00:23:14.459
- "Endure"?

399
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:19.480
Come on. you don't have
to "endure" anything.

400
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.923
- You're missing the point.

401
00:23:21.773 --> 00:23:23.606
- [Blake] No. I'm not.

402
00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.780
- All you want from me is
something you can get for free

403
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.983
on the internet.

404
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.280
And that's probably nice for you too.

405
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.050
because those girls don't seem
to have feelings. do they?

406
00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.420
You could just sit there and imagine

407
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.870
what it'd be like to have
this pretty little girl

408
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.923
who just nods and begs for you. right?

409
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.873
Guess what. Blake? That's not real life.

410
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.423
It's pathetic.

411
00:23:48.932 --> 00:23:51.832
I'm gonna be fucking baffled
if you can't understand that.

412
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.823
- You know. I don't watch
porn to replace you. Alice.

413
00:23:55.823 --> 00:23:59.140
- Then stop watching that-
- I can't stop!

414
00:23:59.140 --> 00:23:59.973
- What do you mean you can't stop?

415
00:23:59.973 --> 00:24:02.733
- It's not that easy!
- Are you scared to say it?

416
00:24:03.714 --> 00:24:06.490
- You know what? Fuck this. never mind.

417
00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.530
- [Alice] Well. we have all night

418
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.130
for you to build up the courage.

419
00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:12.670
- What am I supposed to do. huh?

420
00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:15.020
I mean. you're coming at me
with all this extra bullshit.

421
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.520
and I'm just trying to cut
this fuckin' pineapple.

422
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.453
I mean. come on. Alice.
I love you. I really do.

423
00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.730
But how am I supposed to
tell you all this stuff

424
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.493
about myself that I don't
want anybody to know?

425
00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:30.743
- Blake.

426
00:24:34.703 --> 00:24:38.994
If you're afraid...

427
00:24:38.994 --> 00:24:41.823
If you're afraid to tell me
about the things that hurt you.

428
00:24:42.764 --> 00:24:44.993
then what would be the point of loving me?

429
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.523
- I'm addicted to it.

430
00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.460
- God damn it. Blake. cut the bullshit.

431
00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.033
- What?
- Porn addiction?

432
00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.440
That's not... That's just
a thing that people say.

433
00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.500
Okay? Is that your
excuse to act like a pig?

434
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.340
- No. No. that's not true.

435
00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.153
That's not even close to being true.

436
00:25:13.162 --> 00:25:14.720
(Alice sighs)

437
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.100
This is exactly why I
didn't wanna tell you

438
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:16.933
in the first place.
- No.

439
00:25:16.933 --> 00:25:18.430
I just need you to be real with me.

440
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:20.710
- I just was!

441
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:22.093
And you got pissed at me.

442
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.547
- I'm leaving. We can talk
about this another time.

443
00:25:26.547 --> 00:25:28.701
- Alice. look. come on.
we'll go to Cupcake Castle.

444
00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:29.890
We'll have a great time.
- No. I'm over it.

445
00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.560
- Look. we'll go to Cupcake-
- No. I'm over it.

446
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.190
I'm over it. Blake.

447
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.240
Honestly? Good timing. right?

448
00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.240
- I wanna make things better.

449
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.590
- Blake. get your hands off me.

450
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.150
- All right.

451
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:40.983
I'm sorry.

452
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:50.753
- Go fuck yourself.

453
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:56.610
(fork clinks and scrapes)

454
00:26:14.174 --> 00:26:16.674
(door closes)

455
00:26:21.713 --> 00:26:23.600
(Arlo sighs)

456
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.180
- Where were you?

457
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.460
- Dude. believe it or not...

458
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.760
I just stayed at a
girl's house last night.

459
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.763
- No shit.
- Yeah.

460
00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:35.600
- That's cool. man.

461
00:26:36.662 --> 00:26:38.163
Did you pipe her?

462
00:26:38.163 --> 00:26:40.050
- [Arlo] Did I what?

463
00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.950
- Did you smash?

464
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.763
- Oh. no. no. no. We were close.

465
00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:48.260
I don't think it matters.
Maybe next time I see her.

466
00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:49.093
- Yeah.

467
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.250
Cool.

468
00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:52.100
- So how's Alice?

469
00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.263
- She's good.

470
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.490
- [Arlo] That's good.

471
00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:58.323
- Yeah.

472
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.920
Hey. uh. you remember when you told us

473
00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.390
we should like go do
somethin' or whatever?

474
00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:08.223
- [Arlo] Yeah.

475
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.783
- I mean. she wants to go
to like this fuckin'...

476
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.610
She wants to go to this Cupcake Castle.

477
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:18.540
- [Arlo] Cupcake Castle!

478
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.880
Dude. that's perfect. That's
way better than bowling!

479
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.800
- Yeah. So I don't know.
we might go do that.

480
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.633
- [Arlo] Yeah?

481
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.330
- Who knows. man?
- Take her on a date!

482
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:31.163
- [Blake] Yeah.

483
00:27:38.208 --> 00:27:40.791
(mouse clicks)

484
00:27:43.776 --> 00:27:46.359
(mouse clicks)

485
00:27:48.237 --> 00:27:50.820
(mouse clicks)

486
00:27:53.917 --> 00:27:54.890
- Arlo!

487
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:55.800
Hey.

488
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.060
- Hey.

489
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.230
- Two pineapples now?

490
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:02.110
- Oh. yeah. They're for. um. just in case.

491
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.330
- Just in case of what?

492
00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.350
- Um...

493
00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.580
Nah. don't worry about it.

494
00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.144
- Okay.
- Hey. guess what?

495
00:28:10.144 --> 00:28:10.977
- What?

496
00:28:10.977 --> 00:28:12.350
- You're never gonna believe this.

497
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:13.800
I met a girl the other night.

498
00:28:16.222 --> 00:28:17.852
- Oh?
- Yeah. her name's Ally.

499
00:28:17.852 --> 00:28:22.070
I got kicked out the other night
and we ran into each other.

500
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.780
Her and her friends.

501
00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.600
- What are the odds of that?

502
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.573
- [Arlo] Not high.

503
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:31.190
Anyway. her and her friends
took me to this concert.

504
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.100
Well. it was like a party in a garage.

505
00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.190
but there was a band. and um...

506
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.980
Yeah. that was sweet. She's incredible.

507
00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.270
She's funny.

508
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.223
She likes music. She's smart.

509
00:28:45.638 --> 00:28:46.788
I think you'd like her.

510
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:49.633
- Sounds great.

511
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.440
- I'm going on a date with her tonight.

512
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.100
Maybe I could like tell
you more about her?

513
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.050
- [Celeste] Yeah. I would
love to hear more about that.

514
00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:01.510
- Okay. um...

515
00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.416
I should go.

516
00:29:06.416 --> 00:29:07.833
- [Celeste] Okay.

517
00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.766
- Okay. I'll see you around.

518
00:29:11.766 --> 00:29:13.893
- Okay. bye.
- Okay.

519
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.183
Hey.

520
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.123
I will see you again. right?

521
00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.030
- Yeah. why wouldn't you?

522
00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.580
- That felt weird.

523
00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.883
Like a weird goodbye?

524
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.053
- Well. I will always be here.

525
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:39.513
Sorting gravy.

526
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.190
- Okay.

527
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:45.640
I'll see you around.
- Okay.

528
00:29:59.988 --> 00:30:02.071
(knocks)

529
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.823
- [Ally] Hello?

530
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.130
- Hi!
(Ally chuckles)

531
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:14.176
- I did not expect you
to come to the door.

532
00:30:14.176 --> 00:30:16.110
- [Arlo] (chuckles) Yeah. here I am.

533
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.050
- I love how hard you try.

534
00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:19.410
I'll be right down.

535
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:20.610
- [Arlo] Take your time.

536
00:30:21.906 --> 00:30:24.406
(door closes)

537
00:30:41.214 --> 00:30:44.196
(chuckles)

538
00:30:44.196 --> 00:30:46.446
(chuckles)

539
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:49.886
- [Ally] You all set?

540
00:30:49.886 --> 00:30:52.303
- [Arlo] Uh. yeah. Wow.
you look beautiful.

541
00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:55.710
- [Ally] So. where are we going to eat?

542
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.400
- It's a surprise.
- Oh?

543
00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.475
- Yeah. it's such a good
place. You're gonna love it.

544
00:30:59.475 --> 00:31:01.370
- (chuckles) Is this you?

545
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:02.720
- Yeah. that's me.
- Okay.

546
00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:10.740
What are you doing?

547
00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.335
- I'm getting the door for you.

548
00:31:12.335 --> 00:31:14.600
- [Ally] (chuckles) I have hands.

549
00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.733
- Right. I'm sorry.

550
00:31:16.694 --> 00:31:18.680
- You don't have to apologize for that.

551
00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.513
- Right.

552
00:31:21.437 --> 00:31:24.270
(car door closes)

553
00:31:27.447 --> 00:31:29.197
- (chuckles) Get in!
- Right. yep!

554
00:31:31.334 --> 00:31:32.167
- Silly goose.

555
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.590
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

556
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:35.747
Got it. Thank you.

557
00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:40.986
- Let me. um-
- No. I got it.

558
00:31:40.986 --> 00:31:43.280
- No. it's okay. let me-
- I got it. I got the door.

559
00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.300
- Ally. let me get the door.

560
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.544
- Why?
- 'Cause.

561
00:31:45.544 --> 00:31:47.077
- No. 'cause why?
- Because I wanna do-

562
00:31:47.077 --> 00:31:48.240
- Let me get the door.
- Come on. please.

563
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.975
Let me get the door.
- Arlo. I got it.

564
00:31:49.975 --> 00:31:51.877
- Ally. let me get the door for you.

565
00:31:51.877 --> 00:31:55.226
Just let me. just let me get it.

566
00:31:55.226 --> 00:31:56.059
- I got it. I got it.
- Here. I got it.

567
00:31:56.059 --> 00:31:59.220
- Yeah. no. I got it.
- Ally. come on. please?

568
00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.566
Please just let me do it?

569
00:32:00.566 --> 00:32:01.399
You know what? We're not...

570
00:32:01.399 --> 00:32:02.520
That's it. I'm not going
out to dinner with you.

571
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.793
- Okay. (chuckles) bye.

572
00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.053
- No. no. no. no.

573
00:32:08.144 --> 00:32:13.000
(upbeat jazz music)
(wine splashes)

574
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.180
- [Waiter] You can have
the rest. Mr. McHenry.

575
00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.100
Let me know if you need anything else.

576
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:17.933
- Thank you.

577
00:32:19.243 --> 00:32:21.480
- I didn't know your
last name was McHenry.

578
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.583
- [Arlo] Uh. yeah.

579
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:25.754
It's corny. I know.

580
00:32:25.754 --> 00:32:28.554
- No. I think it suits you. Arlo McHenry.

581
00:32:28.554 --> 00:32:31.874
- So you think I'm corny?
- A little.

582
00:32:31.874 --> 00:32:33.230
Thought you knew that.

583
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:35.553
- Well. you look really nice.
- Thank you.

584
00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:37.630
You look nice as well.

585
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:40.930
- That's why I hate men
that wear flip flops.

586
00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:44.250
I hate it. It's just. get that
shit off your feet. it's...

587
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.010
Oh. don't get me started. I'm
sorry I even brought it up.

588
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.090
- You know. flip flops are pretty normal.

589
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:51.650
Especially in California.

590
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.330
- Yeah. like on the
beach. but anywhere else?

591
00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:56.900
- How do you get to the beach?
- Uh. barefoot?

592
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.960
- [Ally] No. you wear flip flops...

593
00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:02.380
- Who? You and-
- Me.

594
00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.523
My ex.

595
00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.140
My parents. when we were speaking.

596
00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.260
And these alligators

597
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.830
jumped in the raft.
- No.

598
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.470
- Just jumped in the freakin' raft.

599
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.400
- I don't believe you.
- Yeah. no.

600
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.301
Dead gas.

601
00:33:17.301 --> 00:33:18.310
I promise you.

602
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:20.350
Jumped in and ever since then.

603
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.670
I cannot stand bodies of water.

604
00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.670
(smooth jazz music)

605
00:33:35.108 --> 00:33:36.781
- Pretty good. right?
- Yeah. it was really good.

606
00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:38.981
- Whenever you guys are ready.
- Thank you.

607
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.193
Let's see.

608
00:33:47.461 --> 00:33:48.294
Oh.

609
00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:50.930
- That bad?

610
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:53.030
- (chuckles) No. no. It's fine. it's fine.

611
00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:55.560
- Here. let me help out.

612
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.040
- No. no. Seriously. it's fine.

613
00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.440
- You're crazy. Come on. let me help out.

614
00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.120
- No. it's fine. Seriously. it's fine.

615
00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.343
- Arlo. it's fine. I can help.

616
00:34:04.857 --> 00:34:06.120
Let me find my wallet.
(Arlo sighs)

617
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.506
- Ally. put your wallet away.

618
00:34:08.506 --> 00:34:10.570
- Why?
- Put it away.

619
00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:13.410
- You've done all of these
things for me tonight.

620
00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:16.360
and I can do this.
- No. I got it. okay?

621
00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.300
I got it. Sorry.

622
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.620
- Arlo. you don't have to
go through all this trouble.

623
00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.993
- I want to impress you.

624
00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:24.760
- Are you sure?

625
00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.880
- I'm sure.

626
00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.483
Let me just do one thing for you tonight.

627
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:31.154
Let me pay for your food!

628
00:34:31.154 --> 00:34:34.464
(wallet zips)

629
00:34:34.464 --> 00:34:39.464
Thank you.

630
00:34:43.341 --> 00:34:44.174
Thank you.

631
00:34:55.101 --> 00:34:57.601
(knocks)
- Yo!

632
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.030
Hey. what's goin' on?

633
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.553
You weren't answering any of my calls.

634
00:35:06.191 --> 00:35:07.024
(Alice sighs)

635
00:35:07.024 --> 00:35:09.560
- I didn't wanna have this
conversation over the phone.

636
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.223
- Do you wanna sit down for a second?

637
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.313
- I'll make it quick.

638
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.133
We're done.

639
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.713
- Just like that?

640
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.500
- I'm done. Blake.

641
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.072
- Alice. look. we'll go to
Cupcake Castle like right now.

642
00:35:25.072 --> 00:35:27.670
(Alice chuckles)

643
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:30.093
- Wonderful timing. Blake. Really?

644
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.293
- Alice. I need you.

645
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.940
I really think we should sit
down and talk about this.

646
00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.867
Just for a second. I'm...

647
00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:42.360
- I don't need you. so...

648
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.470
- Then yeah. get out of my fuckin' face!

649
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:50.303
All right?

650
00:35:50.303 --> 00:35:53.360
You think I meant any of that
stuff that I just... Please!

651
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.910
I'll find a new girl in a week.

652
00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.443
- Wake up. Blake.

653
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.730
No one is ever going to
love you as much as I do.

654
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:12.090
Not your ex-girlfriends.
not your future girlfriends.

655
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.393
and especially not those girls
that you love so much online.

656
00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.797
But hey. sorry I wasn't good enough.

657
00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:27.410
(door slams)
(somber music)

658
00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:44.190
- [Blake] Yo!

659
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.023
How'd it go?

660
00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.370
- Um. it was good. Yeah. it was fine.

661
00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:51.203
- [Blake] Cool.

662
00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.806
- Everything okay?

663
00:36:54.806 --> 00:36:56.200
- Yeah!

664
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.893
Yeah! No. no. no. I'm good.

665
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.760
Alice and I just broke up.
but it's cool. man. you know?

666
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.920
I feel like she was just kinda
holding me back. you know?

667
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.120
- Look. are you sure you're okay?

668
00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.400
- Yeah.

669
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.310
Yeah. No. no. no. I'm great.

670
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:12.652
- I would totally get it if you're not.

671
00:37:12.652 --> 00:37:14.360
- No. no. No. no. no.

672
00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.400
No. no. no! I'm good!

673
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.483
I told you! I'm perfectly fine. okay?

674
00:37:18.483 --> 00:37:20.860
I'm utterly... I'm completely...

675
00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:24.123
I'm fine. man. Nothin'
to worry about here.

676
00:37:24.123 --> 00:37:25.560
I'm good.
- Okay.

677
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.974
- Yeah!

678
00:37:26.974 --> 00:37:29.224
(chuckles)

679
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.640
- We went to this really
fancy restaurant and

680
00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.077
you know how they don't
really give you any food?

681
00:37:51.077 --> 00:37:53.577
(bag rustles)

682
00:38:02.377 --> 00:38:03.287
(microwave door closes)

683
00:38:03.287 --> 00:38:04.636
(keypad bleeps)

684
00:38:04.636 --> 00:38:07.386
(microwave hums)

685
00:38:11.347 --> 00:38:13.847
(bag rustles)

686
00:38:34.417 --> 00:38:37.334
(microwave bleeps)

687
00:38:44.702 --> 00:38:48.224
(winces) Ow. fuck.

688
00:38:48.224 --> 00:38:52.250
(microwave door closes)

689
00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:56.513
So. how's the. um. the
jungle party coming along?

690
00:39:02.264 --> 00:39:06.764
- You know. it's good. but
literally nobody's RSVPing.

691
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:09.320
- [Arlo] That's weird.

692
00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.153
- Yeah.

693
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.830
The boys. they want more
people to sign up. you know?

694
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:18.600
But it's not like we don't
have people coming already.

695
00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.700
- [Arlo] Right. right.

696
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:23.496
- So. okay. tell me if
this is stupid. right?

697
00:39:23.496 --> 00:39:25.490
- (chuckles) Yeah. I will.

698
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:28.820
- We throw a kickback.

699
00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.070
Like a throwback-themed kickback. right?

700
00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:34.210
We have a couple people over
and we'll play all the old

701
00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:37.305
music that we used to listen
to in like middle school.

702
00:39:37.305 --> 00:39:39.730
You know. we play those games
and stuff like that. you know?

703
00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:43.310
But low-key party and we tell
all the people that are there

704
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:44.733
about the jungle party.

705
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.433
It'll be fun.

706
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.273
- That's actually a
pretty good idea. yeah.

707
00:39:51.667 --> 00:39:52.817
- Let's do it tomorrow.

708
00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:55.383
- Tomorrow?

709
00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.397
You think we could pull that off?

710
00:40:00.397 --> 00:40:02.733
- Arlo. we have to. The
party's on Saturday.

711
00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:04.563
We gotta act now.

712
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.310
- Okay. let's do it.

713
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.050
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I guess...

714
00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:11.820
What. we'll just-
- Yeah.

715
00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.823
Yeah. we'll just clean up a little bit.

716
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.130
Get some drinks. some
snacks. Call a couple people.

717
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:20.660
Nothin' huge.

718
00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:21.653
- Look. dude.

719
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.723
Are you sure you're okay?

720
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:27.453
- Yeah.

721
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:29.193
Yeah. I'm fine.

722
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:35.380
You ask me again and
again and again and again.

723
00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.380
- [Arlo] Yeah. I am.

724
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:38.083
- Stop.

725
00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:40.903
Stop.

726
00:40:43.434 --> 00:40:44.267
- Okay.

727
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:53.460
- I'm sorry. man. I'm just...

728
00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.293
- Long night.

729
00:40:54.293 --> 00:40:55.473
- Long fuckin' day.

730
00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.730
I think I'm gonna go take a shower.

731
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.653
Um. I'll go think about this.

732
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.710
Tomorrow's gonna be great.
though. It'll be fun.

733
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.430
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be fun.

734
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:11.263
- Fun.

735
00:41:28.903 --> 00:41:31.486
(Celeste sobs)

736
00:41:36.144 --> 00:41:36.977
- Hey.

737
00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.293
- Hi.

738
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.130
- What's goin' on?

739
00:41:48.693 --> 00:41:52.370
- It's stupid. I'm. I'm being stupid.

740
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:53.360
- Okay. well...

741
00:41:54.373 --> 00:41:55.623
Well. what is it?

742
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:04.933
- My doorknob is broken
and I don't have a drill.

743
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.793
- Is that it?

744
00:42:13.381 --> 00:42:14.993
- (sobs) Yeah.

745
00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.890
Yeah.

746
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:20.450
- Okay. yeah.

747
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.260
Well. I have a drill. I can fix it.

748
00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:25.744
I can fix it right now.
Why don't we leave?

749
00:42:25.744 --> 00:42:27.323
- I can't. I have to-
- You-

750
00:42:27.323 --> 00:42:28.543
- I have to stay.

751
00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.330
- You've worked a lot
these last couple weeks.

752
00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:35.900
Look. this is probably
why you're so worked up

753
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:36.923
over a doorknob.

754
00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:38.820
Let's get outta here.

755
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.950
- Okay.

756
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:42.783
- Yeah?

757
00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:44.883
- Yeah.

758
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.313
Yeah. I'll go grab my stuff.

759
00:42:50.824 --> 00:42:54.157
(warm electronic music)

760
00:43:01.702 --> 00:43:03.013
- [Rosie] Who's there?

761
00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:03.920
- Hi. Rosie.
- Celeste.

762
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.940
- Hi.
- Are you early?

763
00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.440
- Yeah. I was just really exhausted.

764
00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.820
so I decided to take a half day.

765
00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:12.397
Um. Arlo. this is Rosie.

766
00:43:12.397 --> 00:43:13.830
- Hi.
- Rosie. Arlo.

767
00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:15.200
- Hi. nice to meet you.

768
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.550
- Arlo has a drill. He's
gonna take a look at the door.

769
00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:18.610
- Yeah.
- Oh.

770
00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:20.662
- Yeah. um. where's Sam?

771
00:43:20.662 --> 00:43:22.441
- (chuckles) He's somewhere
playing that game.

772
00:43:22.441 --> 00:43:23.910
(women sigh)

773
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:25.080
- Sam?

774
00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.801
- Yeah. my little brother.

775
00:43:26.801 --> 00:43:28.640
- You never told me you
had a little brother.

776
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.620
- Really? Oh. I thought I mentioned him.

777
00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.550
I'm gonna go get changed while
you take a look at the door.

778
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:36.090
but if it's too hard. it's not a big deal.

779
00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:38.110
Don't even worry about it.
- Yeah. no. it should be fine.

780
00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:38.943
- Okay.

781
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.060
- Uh. you said your name is Alex?

782
00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.910
- Arlo.
- Arlo!

783
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:47.243
Well. it's nice to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

784
00:43:48.201 --> 00:43:49.284
There you go.

785
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:53.230
- How's it goin'?
(Arlo chuckles)

786
00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.133
- I'll be down in a minute.
- Okay.

787
00:43:56.761 --> 00:43:58.160
- [Rosie] Ask Arlo if
he wants some lemonade.

788
00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.730
- Sure.

789
00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:01.180
Would you like some lemonade?

790
00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:04.570
- Oh. um...

791
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.380
Yeah. please.

792
00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.213
- Okay.

793
00:44:15.688 --> 00:44:18.271
(spoon clinks)

794
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.200
Look at this.

795
00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.407
Bills. bills. bills.

796
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.310
How do normal people afford to be normal?

797
00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.480
I need to sell a kidney or something.

798
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:32.930
- I wouldn't put it past you.

799
00:44:37.128 --> 00:44:40.128
You can't keep ignoring the problem.

800
00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.140
Sam can't live with you
anymore. It's not appropriate.

801
00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.270
- It's just a job. Rosie.

802
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:49.470
- It's considered sex work.

803
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:52.170
CPS is really hesitant
about that kind of thing.

804
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:53.826
- [Celeste] They can't
take him away from me.

805
00:44:53.826 --> 00:44:55.760
- Well. they can.

806
00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.543
And god forbid they will.

807
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.823
- I'm doing my best to
give him a normal life.

808
00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:08.140
- How can he have a normal life

809
00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:12.263
when your primary income is
something so incredibly sinful?

810
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.570
- That's none of your business.

811
00:45:20.627 --> 00:45:21.977
I'm gonna go check on Arlo.

812
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.640
- Uh. hey. I just finished. It's all good.

813
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.380
- Cool. thank you.
- Yeah.

814
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.563
- It means a lot.
- Sure.

815
00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:32.833
- I'll go get Sam.

816
00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:34.693
Be right back.

817
00:45:37.393 --> 00:45:38.763
- Is something the matter?

818
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.703
- Does it seem like
something's the matter?

819
00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.130
- No. I just. um...

820
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.650
So you have a little brother?

821
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.170
- You got off work early!
- Yeah. I did.

822
00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:54.973
- So. you wanna play soccer with me?

823
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:57.410
- Sam. this is my friend Arlo.

824
00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:59.370
- Hey. bud.
- Hi. nice to meet you.

825
00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:00.890
- [Arlo] Nice to meet you.
What grade are you in?

826
00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:03.930
- I'm going into sixth.
- Awesome. that'll be fun.

827
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:06.523
- Yeah. I'm excited but kinda scared.

828
00:46:06.523 --> 00:46:08.133
(Arlo chuckles)

829
00:46:08.133 --> 00:46:10.230
So. you wanna play soccer?

830
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:12.200
- Dude. I'm so bad at soccer.

831
00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.033
- You sure?

832
00:46:13.033 --> 00:46:16.010
Tim just got a new ball and
he let me keep the old one.

833
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:17.800
- Hey. what if I played?

834
00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.400
- Really?
- (chuckles) Yeah.

835
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.820
- [Sam] Awesome! Okay.

836
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.720
I'll get the ball!
- (chuckles) Yeah.

837
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:27.239
- I'll get the lemonade!
(Celeste chuckles)

838
00:46:27.239 --> 00:46:28.980
- That's your little brother?
- Mm-hm.

839
00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.560
- No.
- I know what you're thinking.

840
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.630
There's no way we're related.

841
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:34.553
'cause our noses are so different.

842
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.530
that it's like. people are like "what?"

843
00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:39.438
- Oh. yeah. That's definitely the reason.

844
00:46:39.438 --> 00:46:42.329
- It's so obvious. right? Now
you're staring at my nose.

845
00:46:42.329 --> 00:46:43.807

(Celeste sighs)

866
00:48:15.142 --> 00:48:17.633

doing a good job with Sam.

- Why?

868
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.680

that I don't really talk about
and it's nothing personal.

870

I just don't.

871
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.400
- Okay. so like a secret?

872
00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.820
- [Celeste] Well. yeah.
everyone has secrets.

873
00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.050
- Yeah. but not a lot
of people have secrets

874
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:37.373
with Child Protective Services involved.

875
00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:41.650
- Okay. listen. Arlo. I'm
not gonna tell you jack shit.

876
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:43.263
So. stop asking.

877
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:46.100
- Well. what? Did you like
hit him once or twice?

878
00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.330
- Arlo!
- What?

879
00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:49.780
My mom hit me. It's not a big deal.

880
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.850
And people are so PC these
days. I can see maybe...

881
00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:54.070
- Okay. well. I just think

882
00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:55.450
we should talk about something else.

883
00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.277
- I don't think so.
- Okay. let's see.

884
00:48:57.277 --> 00:48:59.629
Have you noticed that it's
already gotten colder this year?

885
00:48:59.629 --> 00:49:02.150
- Okay. really? This is
what you're gonna do?

886
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:04.740
I don't wanna talk about that.
- And Rosie's planning to-

887
00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.240
- Celeste. why are you so
stressed out about this?

888
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.257
(Celeste sighs)

889
00:49:16.257 --> 00:49:18.530
- Is this like a thing you do?

890
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:20.720
You just get people to tell
you their biggest secrets?

891
00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:24.083
- No. it's not a thing
I do. I care about you.

892
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:27.830
Otherwise. I wouldn't ask.

893
00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:30.003
I'm not gonna tell anyone. okay?

894
00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.283
I promise.

895
00:49:42.149 --> 00:49:44.816
(Celeste sighs)

896
00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:47.053
- Okay.

897
00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:49.283
Follow me.

898
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:00.517
Can you shut the door and lock it. please?

899
00:50:00.517 --> 00:50:01.350
- Yeah.

900
00:50:02.797 --> 00:50:07.797
(woman laughs)
(eerie tones)

901
00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.573
- I'm a cam girl.

902
00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:29.693
I'm Amber Star.

903
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:31.813
- Why?

904
00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:37.860
- 'Cause when my parents died.

905
00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:40.540
I had to drop out and take care of Sam.

906
00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:41.870
and work at the grocery store.

907
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:44.220
and at a certain point that
just wasn't enough anymore.

908
00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.930
so I had to start doing
this and it just...

909
00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:49.150
It pays like way better and I can...

910
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.550
Are you gonna say something?

911
00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:58.050
- Um. yeah.

912
00:50:58.050 --> 00:50:59.333
You gotta stop.

913
00:51:01.087 --> 00:51:02.060
- (scoffs) What?

914
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.593
- You don't know who's
watching you online. Celeste.

915
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.330
- They help me pay for Sam.

916
00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:10.183
- So what? What about you?

917
00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:12.733
- What about me?

918
00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:15.670
- You're just gonna get online

919
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:17.480
and let these scumbags jerk off to you?

920
00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.980
- I have to.

921
00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:21.200
- You don't have to!
- Yes. I do!

922
00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.163
- You're worth way more
than this. Celeste.

923
00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:30.593
- Do you think that I like to do that?

924
00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:36.110
Do you think that I do that
because that makes me feel good?

925
00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:37.543
Is that what you think?
- That's not what I-

926
00:51:37.543 --> 00:51:41.190
- I don't do that for me.
Arlo! I do that for him.

927
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:42.833
I do that for Sam.

928
00:51:43.786 --> 00:51:45.786
(sighs)

929
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:50.520
- I guess I don't know who you are.

930
00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.980
- Yeah. I guess you don't.

931
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.540
- Okay. um...

932
00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:05.620
I gotta go. Yeah. I gotta
finish cleaning up the house.

933
00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.263
We're having a party.

934
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:11.273
You can come?

935
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.333
If... If you want.

936
00:52:18.455 --> 00:52:21.430
(door creaks)

937
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.710
Okay. I'll see you.
- Yeah.

938
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:25.700
- Bye.
- Bye.

939
00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:26.643
Wait. Arlo.

940
00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:32.150
I'll see you again. right?

941
00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:35.150
- Yeah.

942
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.983
Why?

943
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.460
- Well. that just...

944
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:44.780
It felt like too much of a goodbye.

945
00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.373
- Yeah. it did.

946
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:52.993
I'll see you.

947
00:52:59.733 --> 00:53:03.233
(upbeat percussive music)

948
00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:09.790
- Yo!
- I'm back!

949
00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:11.463
- [Blake] How you doin'. dog? Come on in.

950
00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:14.483

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:27.930

956
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:29.500
- Nah. just stand there.
- Okay.

957
00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:30.450
- [Arlo] Just come.

958
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:34.100

- Oh. yo.

959
00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:35.668
- This is Celeste.

960
00:53:35.668 --> 00:53:37.959
- Oh. hey. how are you? I've
heard so much about you.

961
00:53:37.959 --> 00:53:40.509
- Okay. nice to meet you.
- Yeah. pleasure.

962
00:53:40.509 --> 00:53:41.811
- So you guys are roommates. right?

963
00:53:41.811 --> 00:53:44.310
- Yeah. we've been goin'
back for like a year now. so.

964
00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:46.350
- Nice.
- It's been great.

965
00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:48.230
Real great. No. I'm just kidding.

966
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:49.690
- Quit playin'. dog.
- I'll get you that water.

967
00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:51.657
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

968
00:53:51.657 --> 00:53:52.630
(chuckles)

969
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:54.310
So. what's your deal? What do you do?

970
00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:58.301

971
00:53:58.301 --> 00:53:59.427
- Yeah. and welcome.
- Thank you.

972
00:53:59.427 --> 00:54:01.533
- Thanks for comin'. yeah. Yeah.

973
00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:04.950
Where do you work?
- At Home Farm Groceries.

974
00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.280
- Where is that?

975
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.507
- Like. right down the street?

976
00:54:09.507 --> 00:54:10.963
- Oh. okay. Yeah. cool.

977
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:13.160
- Yeah.
- For sure.

978
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.470
- It's nice. though.
'cause I get to take home

979
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:17.400
all the food they don't sell.
- Oh. choice. yeah.

980
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.450
Most definitely excellent.
- Yeah. yeah.

981
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.500
What do you do?

982
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.048
- Uh. I don't. (chuckles)

983
00:54:25.048 --> 00:54:26.970
I don't like have a job at the moment.

984
00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:29.793
Actually. I've never really
technically had a jobby-job.

985
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:34.295
- How do you pay for stuff. then?

986
00:54:34.295 --> 00:54:36.840
- I mean. my parents just
kinda like phone me the cash.

987
00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.230
You know? So. it works out.
- Oh. okay. Nice.

988
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:42.849
- No. I don't take it for
granted. you know? Like. bless.

989
00:54:42.849 --> 00:54:44.266
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

990
00:54:44.266 --> 00:54:45.099
- Cool.

991
00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:47.970
- He can be really annoying. I'm sorry.

992
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.020
Here's your water.
- Thank you.

993
00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.110
- Let me introduce you to everyone else.

994
00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:52.660
- Okay. See ya.

995
00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.160
- Yeah. yeah. Most definitely.

996
00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.040
- [Woman] Clearly not. What did you do?

997
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.010
- Well. he turns on the fuckin' lights

998
00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:00.460
and then he gets on the
megaphone and says "don't run."

999
00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.126
Fuck that. I'm out.

1000
00:55:02.126 --> 00:55:04.936
(laughs) I dropped mine!
I dropped mine too!

1001
00:55:04.936 --> 00:55:06.887
- He was probably like 200 feet behind me

1002
00:55:06.887 --> 00:55:08.820
and this guy was just
yelling at both of us.

1003
00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.010
We were just-
- We lost everything.

1004
00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:12.420
- That's a disaster.

1005
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:13.857
- Lessons learned. though. dude. like-

1006
00:55:13.857 --> 00:55:16.740
- Oh. my god. What a fuckin' story.

1007
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.760
- I blame Scary Gary. honestly.

1008
00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.958
- Okay. Gary?
(Celeste chuckles)

1009
00:55:20.958 --> 00:55:22.340
I don't wanna know where he is right now.

1010
00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.910
- Holy shit.
(knocks)

1011
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:25.360
Hey. Blake. can you get that?

1012
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:27.163
Where did he go?

1013
00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:29.790
- I got it. yeah.

1014
00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:32.400
- You got it? You sure?
- Yeah. yeah.

1015
00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.070
- That is a really...

1016
00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:35.000
- Hey.
- Hey.

1017
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.090
- I relived that. that was-
- I loved it.

1018
00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:38.570
I loved every moment.

1019
00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:39.733
It really touched me.
- Guess who.

1020
00:55:39.733 --> 00:55:40.853
- (gasps) Hey.

1021
00:55:41.843 --> 00:55:43.007
- Hey.
- Oh. how are you?

1022
00:55:43.007 --> 00:55:45.263
- I'm good. how are you?
- Excellent.

1023
00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:47.800
Oh. nice.

1024
00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.253
Fit right in.
- I do.

1025
00:55:49.253 --> 00:55:52.050
- Hey. I told you about Celeste. right?

1026
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:53.400
- No. I don't think you mentioned her.

1027
00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.233
- Hi.

1028
00:55:54.233 --> 00:55:55.490
- Hi. I'm Ally.

1029
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:56.323
- Hi.

1030
00:55:56.323 --> 00:55:57.870
- Hey.

1031
00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:00.210
Babe. will you go get me a beer?

1032
00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:01.043
- Yeah. sure.

1033
00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.650
You want some of this?
- No. beer.

1034
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:07.173
- Yeah. I don't want this
anymore. either. It's gross.

1035
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:10.843
- Hi. What's up?

1036
00:56:13.717 --> 00:56:16.815
- So are you guys dating?
(Ally chuckles)

1037
00:56:16.815 --> 00:56:18.023
- Is that what he said?

1038
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:22.703
I don't really know what you'd
call it. but. yeah. I guess.

1039
00:56:24.947 --> 00:56:26.820
- That's really. that's
really nice for you guys.

1040
00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.653
That's great.

1041
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.460
- Yeah.

1042
00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.273
So. are you single. or?

1043
00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:36.003
- Yeah?

1044
00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:38.283
- Okay. cool.

1045
00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.770
I don't know. the way you
were like "it's great"

1046
00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:43.560
just seemed like you've been
single for a while. but-

1047
00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.810
- Okay?
- No. it's not a bad thing.

1048
00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:47.290
- [Arlo] Hey! Your beer.

1049
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:49.440
- Thank you. She's awesome.
- Right?

1050
00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.427
- I cannot wait to meet all
the rest of your friends.

1051
00:56:51.427 --> 00:56:52.260
- Yeah.

1052
00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:56.560
Hey. you. um...

1053
00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.550
Did you meet my roommate?
- No. is he here?

1054
00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:00.837
- [Arlo] I think. Blake!

1055
00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:06.540
- All righty. everybody!
Gather round. far and wide.

1056
00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:09.726
Come on. popper squad. I
got a question for y'all.

1057
00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:11.937
- That's my roommate.

1058
00:57:11.937 --> 00:57:12.770
- Come on.

1059
00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:18.083
All righty. Who here
remembers their first kiss?

1060
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.793
Don't be shy.

1061
00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.730
Since tonight is our throwback kickback.

1062
00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:26.020
I figured it was
appropriate to ask. right?

1063
00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:27.163
So. come on. Please.

1064
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:30.770
No one? Really?

1065
00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:32.170
All right. fine. I'll start.

1066
00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.840
My first kiss (sighs)

1067
00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.080
was during a game of
seven minutes in heaven.

1068
00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.840
If you believe it.

1069
00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.150
That's right. boys and girls.
I was in middle school.

1070
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:46.430
and a couple of us got
together after soccer practice

1071
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:48.560
one day and put all the
boys' names in a hat.

1072
00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.590
and all the girls' names in
a box. mixed them all up.

1073
00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:51.860
We coupled off.

1074
00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.810
Those couples would go into
the closet for seven minutes.

1075
00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:55.760
as the game goes. as I'm sure you know.

1076
00:57:56.750 --> 00:58:01.750
And. um. yeah. so I was fortunate
enough to be drawn first.

1077
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:06.183
as was Angela Maxwell.

1078
00:58:07.676 --> 00:58:09.253
(sighs) What a fox.

1079
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:13.400
That was a big. big day for me.

1080
00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:16.133
I mean. I still think
about it. like a lot.

1081
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:22.080
And. so. here we are at
our throwback kickback.

1082
00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.180
I figured it was appropriate
to have a little fun.

1083
00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:27.230
Let's play an innocent game
of seven minutes in heaven.

1084
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:29.130
What's the worst that could happen?

1085
00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:31.500
So I've given myself the honor

1086
00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.160
of putting all of our names
in these two here bowls.

1087
00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:36.910
and I'm gonna go ahead and
draw two and we're just gonna

1088
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:40.308
see where luck takes us tonight.

1089
00:58:40.308 --> 00:58:41.777
- What the fuck?

1090
00:58:41.777 --> 00:58:43.177
What the fuck are you doing?

1091
00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:46.350
- What's the matter. Arlo?

1092
00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:49.220
I haven't put your name or
Ally's name into these bowls.

1093
00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:51.710
I know that's a big whole thing. so.

1094
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:52.710
So. without further ado.

1095
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:54.840
I'm gonna go ahead and draw two names.

1096
00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.450
Drum roll. please.

1097
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:57.930
Thank you.

1098
00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:59.580
For the gentleman of the evening.

1099
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:02.630
Blake.

1100
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:03.463
Myself.

1101
00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.463
And for the lucky lady.

1102
00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:12.173
Celeste.

1103
00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:14.863
Celeste. that's you. Yeah?

1104
00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:17.633
- Yeah.

1105
00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:24.023
- Celeste. would you do me the honor.

1106
00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:27.030
of joining me for seven minutes in heaven?

1107
00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:32.943
- Um. yeah.

1108
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:36.080
- [Blake] Cool.

1109
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.503
- Yeah.
- Shall we?

1110
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:40.063
- Yeah.

1111
00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:44.550
- [Blake] Cool.

1112
00:59:44.550 --> 00:59:45.900
All right! Someone time it!

1113
00:59:49.516 --> 00:59:52.330
- Hey. do you want another beer?

1114
00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:54.847
- Yeah. sure. I'll take another beer.

1115
00:59:54.847 --> 00:59:56.805
- [Ally] Mm. what's the matter?

1116
00:59:56.805 --> 01:00:01.805
(birds tweet)
(eerie tones)

1117
01:00:07.532 --> 01:00:10.602
(muffled chatter)

1118
01:00:10.602 --> 01:00:11.954
Arlo.
- Hm?

1119
01:00:11.954 --> 01:00:14.100
- Are you coming over tonight?

1120
01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:14.933
- Um...

1121
01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.594
Maybe?

1122
01:00:17.594 --> 01:00:20.130
- (chuckles) Maybe?
What do you mean. maybe?

1123
01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:21.855
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Come on. we made plans.

1124
01:00:21.855 --> 01:00:23.120
(knocks)

1125
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.473
We haven't had like one night alone.

1126
01:00:28.506 --> 01:00:30.756
(chuckles)

1127
01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.653
So. how was it?

1128
01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:41.570
- I plead the fifth.

1129
01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:42.740
- But nothin' like...

1130
01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.427
You guys didn't do anything crazy. right?

1131
01:00:44.427 --> 01:00:47.070
- Uh. no. We fucked.

1132
01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:47.903
- Right.

1133
01:00:50.746 --> 01:00:52.020
(clicks tongue)

1134
01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:56.547
Nah. We didn't.
(snake hisses)

1135
01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.860
- Okay. well I'm probably gonna go.

1136
01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.440
- Yeah?
- Bye.

1137
01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.820
- Wait.

1138
01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.000
Hey. I can walk you to your car.

1139
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.950
- Aw. you're so sweet.
- I can do it too. you know.

1140
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:15.920
- No. it's cool. I've got it.
- I don't mind.

1141
01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.881
- Dude. it'll only take a second.

1142
01:01:17.881 --> 01:01:20.298
(door slams)

1143
01:01:26.999 --> 01:01:29.416
(car bleeps)

1144
01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:35.400
- Thanks for a great night.

1145
01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:38.623
- Yeah. you should come again.

1146
01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.180
- Yeah. I'll see you at the store.

1147
01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:47.760
- You will. I'll probably
need an asprin after tonight.

1148
01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:00.693
- Okay.

1149
01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.240
Well. bye.

1150
01:02:10.276 --> 01:02:11.668
- Bye.

1151
01:02:11.668 --> 01:02:12.828
(car door slams)

1152
01:02:12.828 --> 01:02:15.245
(car starts)

1153
01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:30.640
- Yo. is she good?

1154
01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.213
- Yeah.

1155
01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.473
She's good.

1156
01:02:39.691 --> 01:02:41.203
Where did everyone go?

1157
01:02:41.203 --> 01:02:43.303
- Bro. you took way too long. They dipped.

1158
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:49.846
- What was that fucked up game
you just played with Celeste?

1159
01:02:49.846 --> 01:02:51.000
- Man. what're you talking about?

1160
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.553
I just grabbed her name out of a bowl.

1161
01:02:55.210 --> 01:02:56.863
Nothing even happened.
- Yeah?

1162
01:02:58.067 --> 01:02:59.267
Then how far did you go?

1163
01:03:00.115 --> 01:03:02.390
- (chuckles) Oh. judging by
the way you're responding

1164
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:04.090
right now. I don't think
I should fuckin' tell you.

1165
01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:05.710
- You weak motherfucker.

1166
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:06.910
Why do you always need another girl

1167
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:09.206
to be your fuckin' plaything. huh?

1168
01:03:09.206 --> 01:03:10.897
(Blake chuckles)

1169
01:03:10.897 --> 01:03:13.090
- Man. get off my ass.

1170
01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:15.430
It didn't mean anything.
- It didn't mean...

1171
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:17.160
That's what I'm fuckin' pissed about!

1172
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.366
- Um. why do you care so much anyways?

1173
01:03:19.366 --> 01:03:20.490
- Because!

1174
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:22.800
I invite my friend over.
I didn't think my roommate

1175
01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.770
was gonna pull some shit like that!

1176
01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:26.270
- Bro. relax. all right?

1177
01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:28.260
She agreed to come with me and we had fun.

1178
01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:29.250
- Fun?

1179
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:31.580
I didn't have fun. She didn't have fun!

1180
01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:33.660
- You don't fuckin' know that.
- Shut your fuckin' mouth.

1181
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.310
- Why?
- Why?

1182
01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:37.360
Because I'm gonna fucking
kill you in your sleep!

1183
01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.573
- Arlo. stop!

1184
01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.737
- Whatever. man. Fuck you.

1185
01:03:42.737 --> 01:03:43.680
- You motherfucker.

1186
01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.160
- Arlo.
- What?

1187
01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.594
- [Ally] Why do you care so much?

1188
01:03:47.594 --> 01:03:48.427
- I don't know.

1189
01:03:48.427 --> 01:03:51.100
- Arlo. please tell me
why you care so much.

1190
01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.310
- She was my friend.

1191
01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:54.040
- And somehow what Blake did

1192
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.270
made that much of a difference to you?

1193
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:57.863
- Get off my ass. okay?

1194
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:59.703
- What?

1195
01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:04.990
- Look. I was your plaything.
Your one night stand.

1196
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:06.790
And what. now that I'm not
wrapped around your finger.

1197
01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:08.087
now. now you're worried about me?

1198
01:04:08.087 --> 01:04:10.090
- That's not fair.

1199
01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:13.470
I'm worried because I like you. okay?

1200
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:14.593
- Bullshit!

1201
01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.540
Celeste was there for me.

1202
01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.493
- Did she even want you?
- Yes!

1203
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.233
Up until now.

1204
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.760
You know. I'm such a fuckin' idiot.

1205
01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:30.760
This whole time. I was looking
for a girl and she was there.

1206
01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.510
- Arlo. I'm right here. You can have me.

1207
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:34.863
- [Arlo] I don't want you.

1208
01:04:36.635 --> 01:04:39.873
- Then fuck you!
(cup clatters)

1209
01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:43.073
- I shouldn't... I'm sorry.

1210
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:46.603
I'm sorry. Ally. okay?

1211
01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:49.403
- Yeah. me too.

1212
01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:53.433
Can I kiss you goodbye?

1213
01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:58.100
- Wouldn't that be weird?

1214
01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:00.846
- Yeah.

1215
01:05:00.846 --> 01:05:02.730
You're right.

1216
01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:03.563
Bye. Arlo.

1217
01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:22.010

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:28.653
It's made by hard-working
Americans like you and me.

1220
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:31.730
and 30% of the proceeds go to Hill Home-

1221
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:33.130
- Hey.
- Hey.

1222
01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:35.730
What's up?

1223
01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:38.130
- Oh. you know. just
getting a couple of things.

1224
01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:42.403
- You boys and your pineapples.

1225
01:05:43.310 --> 01:05:44.677
I just don't get it.

1226
01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.240
- Hey. uh...

1227
01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.140
Remember how I told you about
this jungle party yesterday?

1228
01:05:53.362 --> 01:05:54.990
- Mm-hm.

1229
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:57.253
- So. I gotta bring a date. right?

1230
01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:01.110
I was thinking maybe
you could come with me.

1231
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.273
- Um. I'm pretty busy.
so I probably can't.

1232
01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.440
- It starts at like 11 PM.

1233
01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.110
I'm sure whatever you gotta do.

1234
01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:11.810
you could finish up by then. yeah?

1235
01:06:13.818 --> 01:06:15.068
- Is Arlo gonna be there?

1236
01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:17.483
- Maybe.

1237
01:06:18.497 --> 01:06:20.097
I don't know. Probably not. why?

1238
01:06:21.018 --> 01:06:22.963
- I just don't really
wanna see him anymore.

1239
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:26.023
- Why?

1240
01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:28.613
- Stop asking why.

1241
01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:30.873
- Okay.

1242
01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.803
No. he won't be there. You got it.

1243
01:06:35.098 --> 01:06:38.090
So what do you think?

1244
01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:39.140
- What should I wear?

1245
01:06:41.159 --> 01:06:42.230
- It's a jungle theme.

1246
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:44.290
So everyone's gonna be
like an animal. you know?

1247
01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:45.123
- Yeah.

1248
01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:48.010
Okay.

1249
01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:49.393
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

1250
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:52.350
- All right. for sure. I'll see you then.

1251
01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:53.183
- Okay. bye.

1252

(dark electronic music)

1255
01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:26.900
- What the fuck is this?
- What's what?

1256
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:28.250
- This!

1257
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:31.820
Your name on all these piece
of paper and Celeste's as well.

1258
01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:34.240
- I put 'em in like that. bro.
- You stacked the odds.

1259
01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.997
- Yeah. why not? I mean...

1260
01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:39.010
That's how I played my first
game of seven minutes in heaven

1261
01:08:39.010 --> 01:08:40.260
why not do it now?

1262
01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:43.320
- You're more of a fuckin'
pig than I thought you were.

1263
01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.530
- Why are you so concerned.
man? You got Ally.

1264
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:48.120
Why are you so hung up
on Celeste for. huh?

1265
01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.740
- Because I don't want you
to take advantage of her.

1266
01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.490
- I'm not taking advantage of her!

1267
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:53.960
- Then what the fuck is this?

1268
01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.290
- It's a loophole.

1269
01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:57.473
- You're fuckin' weak. man!

1270
01:09:01.839 --> 01:09:05.120
- Man. you don't know me as
well as you think you do.

1271
01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.870
- Keep telling yourself that.

1272
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:08.160
- You know what's funny?

1273
01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.510
So. I was talking to Celeste.

1274
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:10.697
I invited her to my jungle party

1275
01:09:10.697 --> 01:09:11.990
and she's gonna come with me.

1276
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:15.960
Do you know what means
for you? You're uninvited.

1277
01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.010
And if I see you there.
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1278
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:20.711
in front of all those people.

1279
01:09:20.711 --> 01:09:23.390
(big cat snarls)

1280
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:25.497
- She can do better than you.
- Oh. yeah?

1281
01:09:25.497 --> 01:09:27.240
And what? Go with you instead?

1282
01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.850
Please. At least I know
how to treat a woman.

1283
01:09:29.850 --> 01:09:30.683
- Bullshit.

1284
01:09:30.683 --> 01:09:32.609
- Man. you should've heard Alice...

1285
01:09:32.609 --> 01:09:33.740
(big cat growls)

1286
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:34.809
Oh!

1287
01:09:34.809 --> 01:09:35.889
Shit!

1288
01:09:35.889 --> 01:09:38.820
That's what I'm talkin' about. huh?

1289
01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:39.653
Fuck you.

1290
01:09:41.129 --> 01:09:42.238
- Fuck you!

1291
01:09:42.238 --> 01:09:45.655
(moody electronic music)

1292
01:10:40.414 --> 01:10:43.497

(big cat roars)

1295
01:11:36.574 --> 01:11:39.321
- Whoa. whoa. whoa!
What the fuck was that?

1296
01:11:39.321 --> 01:11:40.488
What was that?

1297
01:11:41.803 --> 01:11:43.392
Hey! Hey. come here!

1298
01:11:43.392 --> 01:11:45.309
What the fuck was that?

1299
01:11:52.150 --> 01:11:53.450
- What are you doing here?

1300
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:56.960
- I... Celeste. I'm sorry.

1301
01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.700
Okay? Hear me out.

1302
01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:00.790
I'm sorry for the way I reacted

1303
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:02.390
when you told me about yourself.

1304
01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:06.020
- Yeah. 'cause. it's so fucked because

1305
01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:08.810
you said that you weren't
gonna freak out no matter what.

1306
01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:09.827
and then I told you and you freaked out.

1307
01:12:09.827 --> 01:12:12.400
- Yeah. but that was
before I knew what it was.

1308
01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.720
I didn't know that you
were gonna say that.

1309
01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.840
- Okay. but like. it's so
fucked because I told you

1310
01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.250
like my biggest thing ever. ever.

1311
01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:21.860
and now you hate me for it?

1312
01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:22.970
- Look. I-

1313
01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:23.803
- How do you think I'm supposed to-

1314
01:12:23.803 --> 01:12:25.480
- I don't hate you.

1315
01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:26.993
I would never hate you!

1316
01:12:28.050 --> 01:12:31.230
Okay and second. I thought
about it. I don't care.

1317
01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:32.610
- Okay.
- I don't care!

1318
01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:34.620
- Yeah. you. you...

1319
01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:36.560
Okay. I don't wanna do this right now.

1320
01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.110
so you should just go
find your girlfriend.

1321
01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:39.013
'cause I'm just not. I don't wanna-

1322
01:12:39.013 --> 01:12:42.823
- Find my girlfriend? No.
I don't have girlfriend.

1323
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:47.083
Look. all you did was sacrifice
yourself for your family.

1324
01:12:51.417 --> 01:12:53.043
And I love you for that.

1325
01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.827
- I trusted you.

1326
01:13:00.170 --> 01:13:01.003
- I know.

1327
01:13:02.577 --> 01:13:04.317
Can you just...

1328
01:13:04.317 --> 01:13:06.293
Can you give me a second chance?

1329
01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.710
- Arlo? What the fuck are you doin' here?

1330
01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:12.707
- I'm not doin' anything.

1331
01:13:12.707 --> 01:13:13.624
- Oh. yeah?

1332
01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:15.947
Yeah?
- All right?

1333
01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:20.050
What am I gonna do? Come
here and steal your girl?

1334
01:13:20.050 --> 01:13:21.600
Take her to my castle?

1335
01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.850
Why don't you fuckin' pour me a shot?

1336
01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:26.300
- No. man. I've had enough
shots tonight already.

1337
01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:29.900
- You've done enough shots?
Did I hear that right?

1338
01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:31.853
Blake did enough shots.

1339
01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:37.530
- What? What. you think I
can't fuckin' handle my shit?

1340
01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:39.189
- That's what it sounds like.

1341
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:40.960
- Man. fuck you! I'm trying
to get fuckin' plastered!

1342
01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.130
Let's fuckin' go!

1343
01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:44.240
- Well. let's fuckin' go then.
- Yeah. let's see it.

1344
01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.073
What you got?

1345
01:13:45.073 --> 01:13:46.497
- I got this whole fuckin' bottle.

1346
01:13:46.497 --> 01:13:47.457
- Yeah?

1347
01:13:47.457 --> 01:13:49.957
(Arlo slurps)

1348
01:14:00.484 --> 01:14:02.604
(Arlo coughs)

1349
01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:04.113
- Hey. you seem kinda tense.

1350
01:14:04.113 --> 01:14:07.853
- [Arlo] Yeah. well
that's fuckin' disgusting.

1351
01:14:07.853 --> 01:14:10.370
- Hey. where the fuck is Ally. huh?

1352
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:11.630
I thought if you were gonna
come to this fuckin' thing.

1353
01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:13.363
you'd at least bring your fuckin' girl.

1354
01:14:14.753 --> 01:14:16.120
- Yeah. well it's not working out.

1355
01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:19.890
- Oh. really? I thought it was
fucking just going fantastic.

1356
01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:21.950
- Maybe according to
your fuckin' standards.

1357
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:23.632
- Man. fuck you. man.

1358
01:14:23.632 --> 01:14:25.060
- Fuck you. You hear that?

1359
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:25.893
- [Blake] What?

1360
01:14:25.893 --> 01:14:28.577
- I just said fuck you. but
do you really hear that?

1361
01:14:28.577 --> 01:14:29.830
- What're you fuckin' talkin' about?

1362
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:31.657
- This is my favorite fucking song.

1363
01:14:31.657 --> 01:14:32.567
- What?

1364
01:14:32.567 --> 01:14:33.630
Man. fuck you!

1365
01:14:33.630 --> 01:14:36.490
That's not your fuckin'
favorite song. Get outta here!

1366
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:38.216
Don't fuckin'... Don't touch me. man.

1367
01:14:38.216 --> 01:14:40.240
I don't fuckin' dance.

1368
01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.720
- I'm gonna get real fucking comfortable

1369
01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.883
on your dance floor.

1370
01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:47.360
You're a fuckin' little bitch.

1371
01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:50.895
- Man. fuck you. man.
- You wish you knew.

1372

(crowd chants and cheers)
(upbeat dance music)

1373
01:15:05.105 --> 01:15:06.191
- Fuck you.

1374
01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:07.733
- Do you wanna dance?

1375
01:15:07.733 --> 01:15:08.566
- No.
