4
00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:41.000
I’ll ask one last time.
Where is he hiding?

5
00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:50.250
Your husband’s a wanted man.

6
00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:52.875
We have orders to bring him in.

7
00:00:57.875 --> 00:00:58.833
One last time.

8
00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:01.083
Where is he?

9
00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:07.958
Colonel. leave her with me.

10
00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:10.833
She’s terrified.

11
00:01:11.416 --> 00:01:13.250
She’ll talk. but not like this.

12
00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:17.166
Five minutes.

13
00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:25.666
Listen. madam.

14
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:29.750
We’re not here to kill your husband.

15
00:01:30.416 --> 00:01:32.333
but to arrest him.

16
00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.291
I’m afraid for my son.

17
00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.708
I promise we won’t hurt him.

18
00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:44.500
When your husband is in custody.
we’ll release him to you.

19
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:47.958
Your son isn’t to blame
for his father’s actions.

20
00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:52.875
Think of your son. Just your son.

21
00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:55.208
He’s all that matters now.

22
00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.458
Our guy is in this building. Second floor.

23
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:28.625
Let’s go.

24
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.833
Stay alert.

25
00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:11.791
The team’s heading up the stairs.

26
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:14.750
Alpha Team ready.

27
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.583
Copy that. Alpha Team.

28
00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:50.250
The target!

29
00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:52.333
Get down!

30
00:03:52.416 --> 00:03:53.291
Do it.

31
00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:56.666
I said get down!
Hands where I can see them!

32
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.833
Do it.

33
00:03:57.916 --> 00:03:59.833
Don’t look at me! On the ground!

34
00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:02.541
The kid against the wall. Move him.

35
00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.583
Get the kid somewhere safe. Away.

36
00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:08.791
Dad. what should I do? I’m really scared.

37
00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:13.833
Something’s wrong.

38
00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:39.291
Answer me when I speak.

39
00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:41.958
Any weapons here?

40
00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:46.000
I asked. any weapons here?

41
00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.541
Ask him about weapons.

42
00:04:55.416 --> 00:04:56.750
Do you have weapons?

43
00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.166
Take cover!

44
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.083
Get down!

45
00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:07.166
They saw us.

46
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.333
At eleven o’clock.

47
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.166
The ones at two o’clock! In front!

48
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:19.666
Take the ones on the right!

49
00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:40.291
Target eliminated. The area is clear.

50
00:05:57.708 --> 00:06:00.083
Do it. son. You’ll make me proud.

51
00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:02.291
God will reward you.

52
00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:03.250
Do it!

53
00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:04.291
Shut your mouth!

54
00:06:04.375 --> 00:06:05.541
Do it. son!

55
00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:06.708

56
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.541

I speak five languages.

76
00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:24.291
Just to pound the pavement
for Operation Sentinel.

77
00:09:25.875 --> 00:09:28.125
It’s not what I had in mind. you know.

78
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.083
I get it.

79
00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:33.750
You’re with us. That’s what matters.

00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:40.458
-Yeah.
-Is he bothering Mom?

82
00:09:41.083 --> 00:09:42.125
No. not so much.

83
00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:13.541
Let’s eat. I’m starving.

84
00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:24.541
My God. I can’t believe you’re here.

85
00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:27.500
You’re choking her.

86
00:10:30.166 --> 00:10:34.416
I made this dish for your dad for years.
It reminded him of his homeland.

87
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.375
No!

88
00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:36.500
Seriously?

89
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.916

You were prescribed
a powerful opioid for the migraines.

Sedatives. too. and beta blockers.

98
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.083
An explosive cocktail.
It’s easy to get addicted.

99
00:12:14.625 --> 00:12:16.541
Let’s make a deal. you and me.

100
00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:18.791
I’ll renew your prescription

101
00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:20.583
once you’ve seen a therapist.

102
00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.500
This is for your own good.

103
00:12:24.208 --> 00:12:25.208

117
00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:28.416
-Who’s that guy?
-I don’t know!

118
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.375
-Who’s that guy?
-Just a friend!

119
00:15:30.458 --> 00:15:31.750
-Help!
-Stop!

120
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.083

Got any Oxy? Codeine?

143
00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:23.666

Stop it.

156
00:21:43.916 --> 00:21:45.416

186
00:25:41.416 --> 00:25:43.750
WHERE ARE YOU?!

187
00:25:48.833 --> 00:25:49.666
Good morning.

188
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:51.583
Hi.

189
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:53.666
I have to go.

190
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:54.833
We’ll talk?

191
00:25:55.958 --> 00:25:56.791
Of course.

192
00:26:12.833 --> 00:26:13.875
Open it up.

193
00:26:15.666 --> 00:26:18.458
-Can’t you see it’s empty?
-It’s an inspection.

194
00:26:18.958 --> 00:26:20.625
-What’s the box?
-Just a box.

195
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.875
A jewelry box. You got a date? Open.

196
00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:25.000
Open the box.

197
00:26:25.916 --> 00:26:26.875
Show me the bag.

198
00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:30.666
-What’s this?
-Can’t you see they’re papers?

199
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.583
-Nosy. aren’t you?
-It’s my job.

200
00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:39.041
The bag is fine. Spread your arms.

201
00:26:39.125 --> 00:26:41.208
-Carrying anything dangerous?
-No.

202
00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:47.208
-What are you doing here?
-Nothing…

203
00:27:54.958 --> 00:27:57.458
Drop it!

204
00:28:07.375 --> 00:28:08.416
Not a cop. huh?

205
00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:14.416
Get out of here.

206
00:28:15.291 --> 00:28:16.125
Go.

207
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.333
He got away?

208
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.625
-Sorry.
-Drive.

209
00:28:55.541 --> 00:28:57.166
-Here.
-Thanks.

210
00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:21.458
Hello?

211
00:29:38.416 --> 00:29:40.625
Excuse me. I’m looking for my sister.

212
00:29:59.833 --> 00:30:04.583
Your sister is in stage three coma
due to a cerebral edema.

213
00:30:04.666 --> 00:30:07.208
We can’t operate.
We’re trying to resorb it.

214
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:11.375
I’m sorry.

215
00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:35.166
Hello.

216
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:38.708
Captain Muller.

217
00:30:40.041 --> 00:30:41.208
Tania’s sister?

218
00:30:42.708 --> 00:30:43.750
You have a sec?

219
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.375
She was found this morning.

220
00:30:53.458 --> 00:30:56.083
A passer-by found her.
She was at the beach.

221
00:30:58.125 --> 00:31:01.875
Preliminary examination indicates
that she was raped.

222
00:31:06.166 --> 00:31:07.666
Where was she last night?

223
00:31:08.708 --> 00:31:11.000
I was with her. At the Millenium.

224
00:31:12.625 --> 00:31:13.458
The nightclub?

225
00:31:14.166 --> 00:31:15.000
With friends?

226
00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:17.541
No. just the two of us.

227
00:31:19.208 --> 00:31:22.208
She left before me.
with some people I didn’t know.

228
00:32:14.958 --> 00:32:15.791
Have a good day.

229
00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:23.625
Are you okay?

230
00:32:28.791 --> 00:32:30.166
I heard about your sister.

231
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.958
I’m sorry.

232
00:32:50.833 --> 00:32:52.083
I’ll be five minutes.

233
00:33:00.125 --> 00:33:02.833
You increase the capacity
by around 50 people…

234
00:33:02.916 --> 00:33:04.208
-Yes.
-At that point…

235
00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.625
You the boss?

236
00:33:07.708 --> 00:33:09.375
Yes. can I help you?

237
00:33:10.041 --> 00:33:12.791
I need the footage
on your security cameras.

238
00:33:12.875 --> 00:33:16.000
-I don’t get it. What for?
-Anti-terrorist squad.

239
00:33:23.458 --> 00:33:24.583
What are you after?

240
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.500
How do I see that camera?

241
00:33:41.125 --> 00:33:42.666
Him. Do you know him?

242
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.041
He was right there.

243
00:33:44.958 --> 00:33:46.291
Sure. He’s a regular.

244
00:33:48.208 --> 00:33:49.708
Who are you? What’s this?

245
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.750
The police requisitioned this footage.
Go. or I’ll call them.

246
00:33:54.833 --> 00:33:55.875
Warrant Officer?

247
00:34:05.208 --> 00:34:07.458
-Everything okay?
-Yeah. Let’s go.

248
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.083
You’re holding your breath. Don’t.
Try to breathe out when you shoot.

249
00:35:08.708 --> 00:35:09.541
Coffee?

250
00:35:30.291 --> 00:35:32.625
This is the man my sister left with.

251
00:35:32.708 --> 00:35:33.916
We need to find him.

252
00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.875
How did you get hold of this?

253
00:35:38.625 --> 00:35:40.541
This is a police investigation.

254
00:35:42.125 --> 00:35:43.916
Sorry. I couldn’t help myself.

255
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.333
He’s Yvan Kadnikov.

256
00:35:48.166 --> 00:35:50.375
In addition to this footage.

257
00:35:50.458 --> 00:35:54.625
we also found your sister’s phone.
with pictures from that night.

258
00:35:54.708 --> 00:35:56.666
-You questioned him?
-Not yet.

259
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:58.833
-I’ve made a request.
-What?

260
00:35:59.958 --> 00:36:02.291
Yvan Kadnikov is Leonid Kadnikov’s son.

261
00:36:02.875 --> 00:36:05.083
A tech genius who made a fortune.

262
00:36:05.166 --> 00:36:07.000
He’s influential. respected.

263
00:36:07.083 --> 00:36:09.000
and. some say. protected.

264
00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:11.875
Yvan has been hiding out
in his father’s villa.

265
00:36:13.958 --> 00:36:16.791
They both have diplomatic passports.

266
00:36:16.875 --> 00:36:19.125
The villa has consulate status.

267
00:36:19.208 --> 00:36:20.458
You can’t just get in.

268
00:36:23.958 --> 00:36:25.583
Shit. I have to go.

269
00:36:26.583 --> 00:36:28.500
Look. I’ll be honest with you.

270
00:36:29.166 --> 00:36:30.916
Rape cases are complicated.

271
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.041
When Tania comes out of the coma.

272
00:36:33.125 --> 00:36:34.541
we’ll figure it out.

273
00:36:34.625 --> 00:36:35.791
Let’s go.

274
00:36:35.875 --> 00:36:37.083
I’ll update you.

275
00:37:50.166 --> 00:37:51.625
You only think of food.

276
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:30.333
What are you doing?

277
00:41:28.375 --> 00:41:29.791
Have you lost your mind?

278
00:41:32.791 --> 00:41:33.791
Come on.

279
00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:42.666
Your weapon.

280
00:41:59.583 --> 00:42:00.416
Yeah.

281
00:42:10.291 --> 00:42:13.541
An experienced soldier
must be an example to the others.

282
00:42:13.625 --> 00:42:16.250
Stop getting high. Warrant Officer.

283
00:42:17.958 --> 00:42:19.500
This is the women’s locker room.

284
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.291
-What can I get you?
-Vodka tonic.

285
00:42:41.375 --> 00:42:42.208
You got it.

286
00:43:10.208 --> 00:43:12.125
My sister’s in a coma.

287
00:43:12.208 --> 00:43:14.458
You left with her. What happened?

288
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:18.833
Fuck.

289
00:43:28.375 --> 00:43:30.708
I’ll cut you unless you tell me.

290
00:43:30.791 --> 00:43:33.375
Stop. please. I did nothing.

291
00:43:33.458 --> 00:43:35.833
-Tell me what you did!
-It wasn’t me!

292
00:43:37.208 --> 00:43:38.208
Tell me.

293
00:43:38.291 --> 00:43:39.125
Yvan?

294
00:43:43.166 --> 00:43:44.000
Let him go.

295
00:45:18.666 --> 00:45:19.666
What’s this mess?

296
00:45:20.458 --> 00:45:21.375
I know you.

297
00:45:22.208 --> 00:45:23.875
Get this bitch out of here.

298
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.208
Who are you?

299
00:49:24.666 --> 00:49:26.041
Why are you in my home?

300
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.041
Your son raped my sister.

301
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:35.833
It’s you.

302
00:49:38.708 --> 00:49:41.791
Yvan told me
about your exploits at the club.

303
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:44.083
Well done!

304
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:48.125
I should hire you as security.

305
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.291
Yvan just left.

306
00:49:51.375 --> 00:49:52.708
He’s not here anymore.

307
00:49:54.416 --> 00:49:55.541
In any case.

308
00:49:56.166 --> 00:49:58.708
he doesn’t have much to do
with any of this.

309
00:50:00.041 --> 00:50:01.208
Much to my regret.

310
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.375
my son Ivan…

311
00:50:05.833 --> 00:50:06.916
never liked girls.

312
00:50:17.208 --> 00:50:18.541
Your sister was here.

313
00:50:18.625 --> 00:50:20.625
She came with him and his friends.

314
00:50:22.041 --> 00:50:23.458
She drank my vodka…

315
00:50:24.333 --> 00:50:26.083
danced in my living room.

316
00:50:26.166 --> 00:50:28.958
she even swam half-naked in my pool!

317
00:50:30.208 --> 00:50:31.458
Right in front of me.

318
00:50:33.166 --> 00:50:34.000
So.

319
00:50:34.666 --> 00:50:35.583
let’s just say

320
00:50:36.208 --> 00:50:37.750
I’m not like my son.

321
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.083
That little diamond tattoo of hers…

322
00:50:47.791 --> 00:50:48.833
I ate it.

323
00:51:08.333 --> 00:51:09.541
I’m sorry. my dear.

324
00:51:09.625 --> 00:51:11.333
I must take this call.

325
00:51:11.416 --> 00:51:14.333
I’ll leave you
in the company of these gentlemen.

326
00:51:14.416 --> 00:51:15.500
Hello?

327
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:05.500
Shit!

328
00:52:29.916 --> 00:52:32.291
I WANT TO BE
THE NEW WIND AFTER THE STORM

329
00:52:51.166 --> 00:52:52.083
Hello?

330
00:53:18.083 --> 00:53:20.541
The young Russian. he’s innocent.

331
00:53:21.541 --> 00:53:22.375
I know.

332
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:27.333
I want to forget.

333
00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:31.833
I’d been drinking. I went to his place.

334
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:34.375
They’ll say I asked for it.

335
00:53:37.708 --> 00:53:39.208
It’s my word against his.

336
00:53:40.583 --> 00:53:41.708
No. don’t say that.

337
00:53:42.333 --> 00:53:45.583
If you press charges.
there will be an inquiry. A trial.

338
00:53:46.375 --> 00:53:48.500
And Kadnikov will be found guilty.

339
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:50.291
Leonid Kadnikov.

340
00:53:52.125 --> 00:53:53.208
I know everything.

341
00:53:58.541 --> 00:54:01.125
I don’t want a trial
or my life on display.

342
00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.208
I can’t do that to Mom. see?

343
00:54:13.333 --> 00:54:14.875
He can’t get away with it.

344
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:18.625
What he did to you. he’s done to others.

345
00:54:19.416 --> 00:54:20.500
He’ll do it again.

346
00:54:22.583 --> 00:54:23.583
You realize that?

347
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.500
Leave me alone. please. I’m tired.

348
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.875
…we return to our correspondent in Nice.

349
00:55:00.958 --> 00:55:02.833
Mr. Kadnikov!

350
00:55:02.916 --> 00:55:04.458
Going back to Russia?

351
00:55:04.541 --> 00:55:05.958
Business calls!

352
00:55:06.041 --> 00:55:10.458
But I couldn’t leave the city
without seeing this beautiful church.

353
00:55:10.541 --> 00:55:14.750
It’s been completely renovated
thanks to its generous Russian donors.

354
00:55:14.833 --> 00:55:16.416
Police sources say

355
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.916
your son. Ivan.
is a suspect in a rape case here in Nice.

356
00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:24.125
My son. Yvan.
has nothing to do with that whole thing.

357
00:55:24.208 --> 00:55:27.041
Someone's trying to make some money
off of this.

358
00:55:28.041 --> 00:55:30.166
Is he hiding at the Georgian Embassy
in Paris.

359
00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:32.166
with your friend Andrey Baranov?

360
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:37.250
Are you going back to Russia
so your son can escape the charges?

361
00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:39.958
Mr. Kadnikov! One last question!

362
00:55:40.041 --> 00:55:40.875
Mr. Kadnikov!

363
00:56:05.125 --> 00:56:06.125
What’s happening?

364
00:56:06.875 --> 00:56:07.708
An embolism.

365
00:56:08.208 --> 00:56:09.083
Tania!

366
00:56:10.791 --> 00:56:12.333
You leave. It’ll be okay.

367
00:56:13.041 --> 00:56:15.666
Oxygen. Five liters. continuous. via mask.

368
00:56:16.166 --> 00:56:17.750
Get a heparin pump ready.

369
00:56:18.416 --> 00:56:20.000
I’ve got this. Get out.

370
00:58:54.791 --> 00:58:56.250
Bitch.

371
00:59:51.083 --> 00:59:52.000
Police!

372
01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:04.375
Okay. Let’s go.

373
01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:24.541
-There you go.
-Thank you.

374
01:00:55.458 --> 01:00:57.875
-Hi.
-Hi. What are you doing here?

375
01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.500
I wanted to talk.

376
01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:01.083
Okay.

377
01:01:12.083 --> 01:01:13.583
-You okay?
-Yeah.

378
01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:22.166
-What are you doing?
-The bag.

379
01:01:23.791 --> 01:01:24.625
Quick.

380
01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:27.208
Give me two Glocks.

381
01:01:28.666 --> 01:01:29.625
With ammo.

382
01:01:34.083 --> 01:01:35.750
-And two FAMAS.
-Yeah. okay.

383
01:01:37.458 --> 01:01:39.416
-Fuck… okay.
-With loaded magazines.

384
01:01:45.208 --> 01:01:46.250
Close the bag.

385
01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:48.958
You’re insane.

386
01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:52.041
Put it down.

387
01:01:53.416 --> 01:01:54.250
On your knees.

388
01:01:55.916 --> 01:01:58.250
Tie yourself up!

389
01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:01.750
Come on. quick.

390
01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:09.458
Don’t move.

391
01:02:24.125 --> 01:02:25.750
Listen. I’ll call you back.

392
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:27.083
Okay?

393
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:29.583
Yes…

394
01:03:29.916 --> 01:03:31.541
-Hello?
-Hello?

395
01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:33.541
How are you?

396
01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:37.416
I’d be better if you were here.

397
01:03:38.791 --> 01:03:39.708
Where are you?

398
01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:41.875
I left.

399
01:03:44.208 --> 01:03:45.041
Come back.

400
01:03:46.416 --> 01:03:47.500
Come back. please.

401
01:03:48.333 --> 01:03:49.458
It’s too late. Mom.

402
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.250
Are the police there?

403
01:03:54.791 --> 01:03:55.625
Klara?

404
01:03:55.708 --> 01:03:57.416
You’re making a huge mistake.

405
01:03:58.041 --> 01:04:00.000
Listen to your mother. Come back.

406
01:04:00.083 --> 01:04:02.041
The woman who tried to kill Tania

407
01:04:02.125 --> 01:04:02.958
is alive.

408
01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:05.583
She worked for Kadnikov.

409
01:04:06.583 --> 01:04:08.541
I promise he’ll be put on trial.

410
01:04:09.833 --> 01:04:10.666
No.

411
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:13.291
He’ll pay for what he did.

412
01:04:14.458 --> 01:04:15.291
Right now.

413
01:06:12.583 --> 01:06:14.708
I’m on the third floor. It’s clear.

414
01:06:15.583 --> 01:06:17.125
Coming down to the second.

415
01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:19.375
Understood. Coming your way.

416
01:07:00.166 --> 01:07:02.750
The police have closed all the exits.

417
01:07:03.416 --> 01:07:04.916
I want something to eat.

418
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.416
All you want to do is eat.
Okay. I’ll bring you something.

419
01:07:23.583 --> 01:07:24.666
Hey. listen.

420
01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:27.916
-Do you hear me?
-Yes. I do.

421
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.041
Did you see the car I bought last week?

422
01:07:31.125 --> 01:07:32.375
Why do you need that?

423
01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:35.083
For driving women around.

424
01:07:35.916 --> 01:07:37.500
I prefer to walk.

425
01:07:51.666 --> 01:07:52.500
Dima. Sasha.

426
01:07:53.166 --> 01:07:54.333
What’s happening?

427
01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:57.958
Dima? Sasha?

428
01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.333
Are you there?

429
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.250
Where are you? Help me!

430
01:08:55.291 --> 01:08:56.666
Get me out of here!

431
01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:27.375
What do you want?

432
01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:29.750
Money?

433
01:12:19.291 --> 01:12:21.416
Doctor! Get a doctor up here! Quick!

434
01:12:34.625 --> 01:12:37.708
DUBAI. THREE MONTHS LATER

435
01:13:23.541 --> 01:13:24.541
Yes. of course.

436
01:13:25.791 --> 01:13:28.125
Yes. I need his support.

437
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:31.166
Understand? It’s important.
