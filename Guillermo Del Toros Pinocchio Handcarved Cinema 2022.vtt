00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:09.592
Animation has become.

4
00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:12.971
in the minds of the consumers. a genre.

5
00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:16.016
But it also is an art form.

6
00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.852
and of all the art forms of animation.

7
00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.563
to me. the most sacred and magical

8
00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:22.814
is stop-motion

9
00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:26.401
because it's the bond
between an animator and the puppet.

10
00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.989
And normally. film captures reality.

11
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.577
Animation creates it
and has to simulate the capture.

12
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.832
You give life to it.
and that is the highest art form.

13
00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.878
What's gonna make us unique is

14
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:48.465
bringing Guillermo's live-action aesthetic
to this movie.

15
00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:51.092
There's a sophistication of filmmaking

16
00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:56.097
that when it's applied to stop-motion.
which is inherently handcrafted.

17
00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:59.434
you get a really powerful combination.

18
00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:02.020
<i>Pinocchio</i> is a movie
that has a huge heart.

19
00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:05.440
It deals with who you are.
staying true to yourself.

20
00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:08.985
and not having to change to be accepted.

21
00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:15.283
It also is about being a father
and being a son.

22
00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:17.744
learning to love your family

23
00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:20.080
for who they are and how they are.

24
00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:23.958
Guillermo's <i>Pinocchio</i> is
completely surprising.

25
00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:30.173
He's able to Trojan horse
these really big discussions

26
00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:34.302
into a really entertaining family movie.

27
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.473
He is always looking at
what it is to be human

28
00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.934
and what it is to join a society.

29
00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:44.896
That's his territory.
and <i>Pinocchio</i> is all about that.

30
00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:48.608
It's a retelling of a story
you think you do know.

31
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:49.567
but you don't know.

32
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.658
The outsider aspect
of <i>Pinocchio</i>

33
00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:58.701
is what attracted me to the story.

34
00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.162
I identify with outsider creatures

35
00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:03.623
like the creature of Frankenstein
or Pinocchio

36
00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:06.334
and having to figure out the world
on your own.

37
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.088
that the things that you are told
are not enough.

38
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:13.258
And you want to know why this is right
and why this is wrong

39
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:16.010
when this feels wrong
and this feels right.

40
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.391
To me. there is a fragility
to Pinocchio being otherworldly

41
00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.519
and people being unable
to see him as a real boy

42
00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:28.565
because he doesn't look like what people
think a real boy should look like.

43
00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.108
I'm a real boy!

44
00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:31.943
Demon!

45
00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:33.319
Witchcraft!

46
00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.781
The magic is
it's Guillermo's take on <i>Pinocchio.</i>

47
00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:40.243
so the look of it is
such a Guillermo film.

48
00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:44.038
He's brought
sort of the creature aspect into it

49
00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:47.500
that you could only hope
Guillermo would bring into <i>Pinocchio.</i>

50
00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.961
But there's a real heartfelt.

51
00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:52.797
sort of emotional side
to the story as well.

52
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.591
Pinocchio!

53
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.510
Love hurts.

54
00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:00.555
It took about 15 years
to do <i>Pinocchio.</i>

55
00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:04.893
and we had to assemble
sort of the best team in stop-motion.

56
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.146
I call your attention to
the miniature buttons.

57
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.440
-Yeah.
-Damn. they're fine.

58
00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.233
They are. aren't they?

59
00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:16.321
We did a three-way link between
London. Portland. and Guadalajara.

60
00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:20.700
I have been supporting Mexican animation
since the '80s.

61
00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:23.953
and we wanted to have a link with Mexico.

62
00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.790
I wanted Mexican animators
animating Pinocchio and the cricket.

63
00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:33.713
Main characters because that demonstrates
the great artistry and technical capacity

64
00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:36.341
that a Mexican studio can have
in animation.

65
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.844
We got some of the best animators
in the world.

66
00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.222
all under the guidance of Shadowmachine.

67
00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:47.602
We embarked on an amazing process
to build a stop-motion team

68
00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:51.064
commensurate with the vision
that Guillermo had.

69
00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:54.317
The depth of experience
on our project was really great.

70
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.362
It's just tremendously exciting because.

71
00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:00.990
you know. we get to be
at the top of our game.

72
00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:04.369
You know. we're always waiting for
a script that sort of rises

73
00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:06.162
to something that you want to service.

74
00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.039
and this is one of those experiences.

75
00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:11.751
The thing that
immediately caught my attention

76
00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:15.713
was that it didn't look like
any animated film

77
00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.006
you've ever seen before.

78
00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:23.429
Guillermo's aesthetic is woven through
almost every frame of this film.

79
00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.682
There's a valuable difference between

80
00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:29.018
stop-motion as an art form and digital.

81
00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:32.772
We have seen a movement from
stop-motion in the early days

82
00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:36.776
where you had the moiré
and the flicker of fur and fabric.

83
00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:39.570
even the atmospheric dust on the sets.

84
00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:42.949
and the imperfection of it was
so gorgeous to look at

85
00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:45.618
because it told you how
the thing was done.

86
00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.789
I really wanted this movie
to land in a way

87
00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:54.335
that had the material nature of
a handmade piece of animation.

88
00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.049
an artisanal. beautiful exercise
in carving. painting. sculpting.

89
00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.343
but it had the sophistication of movement

90
00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:07.223
that research on rigs and puppetry making
have taken us to.

91
00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:13.730
So. you know. my role as
the puppet fabrication supervisor.

92
00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:17.400
it's really getting
a director like Guillermo

93
00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:20.695
to trust me with his image of his movie.

94
00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:23.031
and then it's the practical element of

95
00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:25.783
how do we turn these inanimate objects

96
00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.786
into fully animatable puppets?

97
00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:32.790
We have to plan out a lot of
how it's going to move.

98
00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:36.544
what it needs to do
within the arc of its story.

99
00:05:36.627 --> 00:05:39.630
You know. what is it going to
need to be rigged on.

100
00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.007
and how much does it weigh?

101
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.176
That's even a thing we have to consider.

102
00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.220
It's a tough balance.
especially when it comes to creatures.

103
00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:51.476
which are certainly more cumbersome
than a human character.

104
00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:55.521
You've got so many
fantastical. wonderful elements

105
00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.815
that each and every one of them
is hard to do.

106
00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.651
but you have to put it together
and make it work together.

107
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:05.406
It's a very long process
getting a puppet ready.

108
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.742
You know. it might take a year

109
00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:09.827
to get to where
you've got a finished puppet

110
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.789
that everyone's happy with.
and it can actually go out on stage.

111
00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.332
and then you can animate it.

112
00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:18.169
Guillermo really wanted
this to be mechanical

113
00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:19.754
rather than replacement.

114
00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:22.882
We have both puppets in this movie.

115
00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:26.636
Replacement is every mouth shape
and every expression

116
00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.304
being a transplant.

117
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:32.016
So. its every mouth shape is
a separate face mask

118
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.060
that sits on the puppet's face.

119
00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:37.688
Pinocchio is replacement
because he's a wooden boy.

120
00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:41.234
So. we made him act like
he was made out of wood.

121
00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:44.404
His face stays the same size at all times.

122
00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:45.988
He doesn't have any puffy cheeks.

123
00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:49.992
The wood grains in his face
doesn't move around at all.

124
00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.661
It just opens up.

125
00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:55.832
I sort of described it as using a chisel
to open the mouth up.

126
00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:59.627
So. you just go it in one bang.
There's a bit of cushion on the back end.

127
00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:02.130
Bang! Open.

128
00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:05.299
I think that was a stroke of genius
when we all came up with that.

129
00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:06.634
I was like. "Yes!"

130
00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:13.182
Technically speaking. it was gonna
be a really difficult puppet to create.

131
00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:16.894
We had to find new techniques
so that you could see the character

132
00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:20.773
in all its wooden form
with its crude wooden joints.

133
00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:23.776
We wanted it to be as practical
and as durable

134
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.572
as a feature film would demand of
a puppet of that size.

135
00:07:28.072 --> 00:07:31.951
Pinocchio himself is the first puppet

136
00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:34.745
fully printed out of a 3D printer.

137
00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:39.083
But then Volpe and Geppetto
are all mechanical.

138
00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:42.128
A mechanical animation is where
you have a silicone skin

139
00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:47.467
sitting over what is essentially
a Swiss watch of mechanisms.

140
00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:51.345
With that. the animator move
frame-by-frame

141
00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:55.016
every element from the outside
through the skin.

142
00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:57.602
It's been a long process
working with the animation team

143
00:07:57.685 --> 00:08:01.564
to see how we would develop
the techniques used for each character.

144
00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:04.317
You know. Geppetto works so well

145
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.279
because he's got a big mustache
and a big beard and heavy eyebrows.

146
00:08:08.362 --> 00:08:12.074
And all of these things
lend themselves to mechanical faces.

147
00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:15.745
So. when the animator started to work with
the first Carlo puppet.

148
00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.872
it was such a struggle.

149
00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:19.957
The more smooth the face.

150
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:23.252
the harder it is
to make those expressions change.

151
00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:26.756
So. the animators started relying on
the lower eyelids.

152
00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.550
on the brows. on the body language.

153
00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.469
And especially with Carlo.

154
00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:33.888
one of the things we wanted to do was

155
00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:36.682
do unnecessary gestures in animation.

156
00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:39.477
This was an ambassador to that

157
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.272
because nobody does
more unnecessary gestures than a child.

158
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.359
One of Guillermo's initial conceits was

159
00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:48.236
really making sure that you hold on

160
00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.988
to the realness
and the tactileness of stop-motion

161
00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:54.367
and the idea that you animate mistakes.

162
00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:59.539
He was really stressing
the realism of the performances

163
00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.959
like little mistakes
that people make all the time.

164
00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:07.421
If they go to pick up a dinner plate.
they maybe miss it

165
00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.215
and go for it again.

166
00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.760
In live-action.
you beg for a mistake.

167
00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:16.681
you beg for a line reading
that is not what you expected.

168
00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:21.185
This invoking of reality is
very hard in stop-motion

169
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:26.190
because you are animating it.
so you need to simulate those accidents.

170
00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:27.191
Lift your leg.

171
00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:30.111
Because he's a live-action director.

172
00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:34.949
he understands the time it takes
for people to process

173
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:37.577
faces and things on screen.

174
00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:41.622
On this film.
Guillermo really has taken the time to say

175
00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:43.499
it needs to get slowed down.

176
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:46.669
We need to see Pinocchio
thinking about that.

177
00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:49.130
I said. "If the character is thinking.

178
00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:52.258
I wanna see the eyes
inputting the information."

179
00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:55.011
"I want to see a subtle shift."

180
00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:56.679
If you animate the ordinary.

181
00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:59.307
you will achieve something extraordinary.

182
00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:06.397
I co-directed with Mark Gustafson.
who. for me. is

183
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.609
a legendary director and animator.

184
00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:12.862
It's been amazing
working with Guillermo because

185
00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:16.157
he's an artist
who's at the top of his game right now.

186
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.202
So. it makes you have to
raise your game as well.

187
00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:24.415
Guillermo's been fantastic in the way that
he completely trusted the animator.

188
00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:26.500
a bit like he trusts his actors.

189
00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:31.130
Basically. the way you do
a live-action is between action and cut.

190
00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:32.965
the actor owns the shot.

191
00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:36.052
And you make this bond with the animators.

192
00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:40.139
and it gives them a lot of power
to think through the puppet.

193
00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:44.644
to not do an action. to avoid pantomime.

194
00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:47.188
and to give us real acting.

195
00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:50.566
The animators are our actors.

196
00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:54.362
Animation is such an elaborate process.

197
00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:57.865
and we wanted animators
to own the performances.

198
00:10:57.948 --> 00:11:00.159
One of the founding principles

199
00:11:00.242 --> 00:11:03.120
that Guillermo and I came up with
when we started this was

200
00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:08.376
give the performance back to the animators
as much as possible.

201
00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:13.422
Part of that is them shooting these
what we call LAVs. live-action videos.

202
00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:20.179
Do not tell lies
or your nose will grow and grow…

203
00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:22.473
Most times before you do a shot
as an animator.

204
00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:24.141
you would go and investigate

205
00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.435
what kind of shape
this shot is gonna have.

206
00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:29.271
what kind of motion. what kind of speed.

207
00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:32.400
A good and quick way to do that
is just film yourself.

208
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.568
So. the animator would turn up with

209
00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:37.738
a little video of themself
doing the action.

210
00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:39.949
Guillermo really loved that.

211
00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:43.619
Every time he sees them.
he's. like. a big smile and going. "Yeah!"

212
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.162
"Just like that! It's great!"

213
00:11:46.288 --> 00:11:48.124
Spazzatura.

214
00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:52.920
Gris Grimly designed
an amazing Pinocchio.

215
00:11:53.003 --> 00:11:58.759
To me. the best Pinocchio I've seen
because it's so simple and so beautiful.

216
00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:00.803
When I started
illustrating Pinocchio.

217
00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:03.597
I just wanted him to be lanky and awkward

218
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:06.600
like a puppet without the strings.

219
00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:09.353
Designing Pinocchio
was the main character

220
00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:11.021
we wanted to get down first.

221
00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:14.483
Guillermo had the wonderful idea of
it being almost Frankenstein-like

222
00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.986
in that one half is finished
and one is unfinished.

223
00:12:19.196 --> 00:12:21.115
We made him asymmetrical

224
00:12:21.198 --> 00:12:23.284
because Geppetto carves him
when he's drunk.

225
00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:27.997
And one of the ideas is
he starts with the ear and this hair.

226
00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:32.168
and he's really careful with that.
and then he goes. "Ah."

227
00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:34.462
And kind of finishes him quick.

228
00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:37.006
-Mm.

229
00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:41.719
Geppetto was the one character
that we designed the most.

230
00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:43.846
We layered him out on clothing.

231
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.100
We made it a point to make
everything he was wearing ratty.

232
00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:52.354
You know. he's not a guy
that can afford many pairs of pants.

233
00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.398
My son.

234
00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:57.943
We have to take him to a place
where he's not pleasant.

235
00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:02.031
I mean. this guy drinks.
This guy gets angry.

236
00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:04.700
This guy doesn't understand Pinocchio.

237
00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.994
It takes him a while to realize that

238
00:13:07.077 --> 00:13:10.915
his love for this boy is
much more important

239
00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:14.335
than doing what is socially acceptable.

240
00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:17.046
Even if he's dead. I could still book him.

241
00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:21.550
How dare you. sir? Show some respect!

242
00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:24.553
The main villain
in Collodi's stories.

243
00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.263
a character called Mangiafuoco.

244
00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:28.682
is a very large character.

245
00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:31.519
and I had a bad feeling about it.
I didn't like it.

246
00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.437
I thought it was very much a cliché.

247
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:36.398
Guillermo called whoever was working
on the show at that point.

248
00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:38.526
and he looked at us.
and he said. "Hey. guys."

249
00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:42.196
"I think our main villain is crap.
and I want to change it."

250
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.200
And I said. "I really think
this should be the guy."

251
00:13:46.283 --> 00:13:49.286
"Can we make him the main antagonist?"

252
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.873
And that was just. "Okay. All right.
We've already built the villain."

253
00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.334
-So. what do we do?

254
00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:57.545
So. what was your answer to his question?

255
00:13:57.628 --> 00:14:00.840
It was one of those moments where
once you see it. you can't unsee it.

256
00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:03.467
and you work with the amazing team
to figure it out.

257
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:07.513
There was a lot of time
that was spent designing Mangiafuoco

258
00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:11.016
with a huge beard. and this puppet.

259
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.645
we finished making him. and he's now
a background character for the circus.

260
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.692
Go away! This is not a spectacle.

261
00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:21.318
But it is!

262
00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:26.490
Volpe is one of the more
over-the-top characters.

263
00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:28.951
He's really fun because
he's kind of the devil.

264
00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.703
He's very transactional.

265
00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:32.454
He's just what's best for him.

266
00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.748
One last detail to take care of.

267
00:14:35.499 --> 00:14:37.042
Whoa!

268
00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:38.919
When we were thinking about the cricket

269
00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:42.756
I was thinking of a cricket
that has traveled all over the world.

270
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.426
and lived with a sculptor and a barrister.

271
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.803
And I thought of the name

272
00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.848
Sebastian J. Cricket.

273
00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:54.018
That sounded so sophisticated.

274
00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:57.438
Cricket was really driven
by Guillermo.

275
00:14:57.521 --> 00:15:01.108
He takes this character
who is a little bit arrogant.

276
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:04.028
and he makes you really like him
and want to follow him.

277
00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:08.407
The animation on the cricket is
very simple in appearance.

278
00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.494
but that means
you have to be very judicious with that.

279
00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.330
He uses the hands a lot

280
00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:16.290
to explain. to…

281
00:15:16.373 --> 00:15:18.042
You know. he's very righteous.

282
00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:21.420
So. he uses the hands
to demand an explanation.

283
00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:23.422
to accuse somebody.

284
00:15:23.505 --> 00:15:24.548
to signal.

285
00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:27.384
He's a character that uses
his whole body as a face.

286
00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:29.178
I'm not a governess. madam.

287
00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:31.555
And then. you know. it's a creature design

288
00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.682
which is a completely different thing.

289
00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:36.769
and that is Guillermo's true wheelhouse.

290
00:15:49.823 --> 00:15:53.535
The dogfish. Death. the sprite.

291
00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:56.163
the cricket. the rabbits

292
00:15:56.246 --> 00:15:59.458
all have the same
unworldly blue violet skin

293
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:01.335
because they are all related.

294
00:16:01.418 --> 00:16:05.089
The rabbits take the dead
to the other side.

295
00:16:05.172 --> 00:16:08.717
And they're an extension of Death.
which is the sister of life.

296
00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.052
which is the sprite.

297
00:16:10.552 --> 00:16:12.554
The concept art was
never clean or stylized.

298
00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.933
It wasn't a very polished looking like…
look to a character.

299
00:16:16.016 --> 00:16:18.060
They would have dirt
under their fingernails.

300
00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:19.895
They would have. you know. blemishes.

301
00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:23.190
and it was like he wanted every character
to feel like it lived a life

302
00:16:23.273 --> 00:16:24.400
before in the film.

303
00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.652
You know.
we would create a character.

304
00:16:26.735 --> 00:16:30.739
uh. make a beautiful costume.
you know. for Geppetto

305
00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:32.825
or one of the other characters.

306
00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:34.618
and you get a message back.

307
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:36.245
Guillermo's seen it.

308
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:38.497
It's gotta look dirty.

309
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.290
You see. you make a beautiful puppet.

310
00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:43.210
but it looks like it's come straight out
of the shop when you finish it.

311
00:16:43.293 --> 00:16:47.047
It doesn't look
like it's a character in a story.

312
00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:50.259
You don't have to believe
they are real people.

313
00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:52.636
You have to believe in them as characters.

314
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.349
and we wanted to embody the form
and the character into one<i>.</i>

315
00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:58.976
We wanted to fuse them.

316
00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:03.772
Volpe with his sort of demonic.
horn-like wings on the hair.

317
00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:06.608
The innocence of Pinocchio.
his simplicity.

318
00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:11.363
The sort of earthiness
and beautiful old-world grace in Geppetto.

319
00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:15.492
We wanted to do a labor of design
that told the story.

320
00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:22.708
<i>Stridulations of My Youth</i>
by Sebastian J. Cricket.

321
00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:25.919
In terms of scale.

322
00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:30.132
we use different size of puppets
for different needs.

323
00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:35.971
This is our Pinocchio to interact with
the cricket. which is this height.

324
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:37.931
Sebastian J. Cricket.

325
00:17:38.432 --> 00:17:42.811
And in order for him to be the right size
in very few shots.

326
00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:46.440
we need the cricket
and the shoulder of Pinocchio

327
00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:48.567
talking to him. whispering in his ear.

328
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.861
So. we use this big Pinocchio.

329
00:17:50.944 --> 00:17:54.990
And then in certain shots.
we use this small Pinocchio.

330
00:17:55.574 --> 00:17:56.909
Then we have this

331
00:17:57.534 --> 00:17:58.827
small crickets

332
00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:00.579
for other shots.

333
00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:02.748
particularly when he gets crushed.

334
00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:04.541
Oh!

335
00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.043
The pain.

336
00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:08.962
You can only build a puppet
so small

337
00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:11.924
and still have good control over it
in terms of the animation.

338
00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:16.762
So we built Pinocchio
as small as we could and still

339
00:18:16.845 --> 00:18:18.764
have really good control over him.

340
00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:22.601
And then everybody else's scale is
in relation to that.

341
00:18:22.684 --> 00:18:24.686
And then the sets are in relation to that.

342
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.275
Everything has to be built.

343
00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:33.403
That's sort of the blessing
and the curse of stop-motion.

344
00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:37.324
You know. you can make things look
exactly as you need them to look.

345
00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:38.700
I think that's exciting

346
00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.577
because you fully create a world

347
00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:43.831
and a world that's unlike any other
or very much like another.

348
00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:46.875
And that's kind of really powerful.

349
00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.169
It helps you best tell the story.

350
00:18:49.753 --> 00:18:54.007
So we looked at a lot of Guillermo's films
and picked up key things.

351
00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:57.344
Colors. textures.

352
00:18:57.427 --> 00:19:00.889
shapes of windows.
and just general atmosphere.

353
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.811
You can probably tell within three seconds
that you're watching a Guillermo film.

354
00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:07.646
and we wanted that to be true of this.

355
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.440
The sets are evocative

356
00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:14.444
of the beauty
of these little Italian towns.

357
00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:16.321
and I know places just like this.

358
00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:18.574
We did a huge amount
of research.

359
00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:22.536
Photographs and posters.
we copied typography

360
00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:24.872
because I wanted the world to feel real.

361
00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:27.332
All the structures in the town

362
00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:29.501
have the remnants of their origins

363
00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:32.588
like medieval ruins.
and then on top of that

364
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:34.590
you have 18th-century carvings.

365
00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:40.637
and then you have murals
that were frescoes from the 1500s. 1400s.

366
00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:43.015
So. it feels layered.

367
00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:46.518
Once you're translating script
to storyboards.

368
00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:49.646
those decisions can define
how massive the vision can be.

369
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.691
and you can make choices in story
where you put the camera.

370
00:19:52.774 --> 00:19:54.443
how much the camera's moving.

371
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.654
One of the unique challenges
that we have is

372
00:19:57.738 --> 00:20:00.032
the animator has to actually
be able to get in

373
00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:01.783
and reach the puppets and animate.

374
00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:04.453
So. we have to design these sets

375
00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:07.998
so that they can be pulled apart
in many different ways.

376
00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:11.585
It's all a big. like. teamwork.
and we're all sitting there together

377
00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:13.545
talking about how this is gonna look.

378
00:20:14.254 --> 00:20:15.631
The film looks a certain way.

379
00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:19.676
and then the animation
needs to fit into that world as well.

380
00:20:20.677 --> 00:20:23.513
Early on.
you have to find out the aesthetic.

381
00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:25.224
like exactly what it is.

382
00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:27.976
And we'll base it on
something very simple.

383
00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.312
You know.
we have a pine cone in the movie that.

384
00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:32.940
it's a… it's a charming little…
little object.

385
00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:36.860
and we looked at it over and over
for months at different intervals.

386
00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:39.863
and we would look at other things
through the lens of

387
00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:42.824
like how did we make this pine cone?
We like this look.

388
00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:46.578
If you know how the lines of
a simple. organic pine cone works.

389
00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:48.664
you start to learn the line language

390
00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:52.584
and the level of detail
and the level of reality

391
00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:54.670
that we're trying to infuse
into this movie.

392
00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:57.547
You just kind of get a feel for
what this world looks like.

393
00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:03.053
The Death puppet left room
for certain aspects to be explored.

394
00:21:03.136 --> 00:21:06.848
Yeah. 'Cause I mean. I think originally
the Death. we had the snake tail.

395
00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:09.059
and it was you and Toby

396
00:21:09.142 --> 00:21:14.523
saw that scaling as a pine cone texture.
And that was so brilliant.

397
00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:18.652
It was a great way of tying it into
the pine cone that Death represented

398
00:21:18.735 --> 00:21:19.820
every living thing.

399
00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:23.198
There were some pants
for Spazzatura.

400
00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:25.117
And the line in the pants…

401
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.744
-Had to be handmade.
-It had to be handmade.

402
00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:31.331
But it didn't wanna be overt. you know.

403
00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.333
It wanted to feel real in a sense.

404
00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:36.211
but it sort of reflected
into everything else.

405
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.547
this notion of it's not perfect.

406
00:21:39.047 --> 00:21:40.841
It's got a character to it.

407
00:21:40.924 --> 00:21:43.844
We'd all seen the sample.
It had come from Mackinnon and Saunders.

408
00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:47.264
They gave us a swatch board. If we
can handle these stripes nine ways.

409
00:21:47.347 --> 00:21:49.933
Here's ones that we like.
and we were all. "That one."

410
00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:52.227
And we laughed.
We're like. "We all agree."

411
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:54.104
"That's so great. It must be that one."

412
00:21:54.187 --> 00:21:56.648
Then the next step was
to talk about well. why?

413
00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:58.567
Because if you talk about why.

414
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.445
then maybe those rules
can inform other things.

415
00:22:01.528 --> 00:22:03.739
There are rules. you see.

416
00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:05.699
We had to find
the language of it.

417
00:22:05.782 --> 00:22:08.577
how cartoony is it. how real is it.

418
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.538
And there was sort of a sweet spot
I think we landed in.

419
00:22:12.122 --> 00:22:14.750
Having a magical element like Pinocchio

420
00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:19.755
required that we had
a more grounded world around Pinocchio.

421
00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:22.382
If everything is magical.
nothing is magical.

422
00:22:22.466 --> 00:22:26.219
We needed to ground the world.
Proportions needed to be correct.

423
00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:28.180
The physics needed to be correct.

424
00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:32.434
It provided stakes for the emotional story
and arc of Pinocchio.

425
00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:34.603
Guillermo has a very good eye for that.

426
00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:39.316
He notices when something
is not going to fit into the world.

427
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.444
This is no different
than designing

428
00:22:42.527 --> 00:22:45.030
and decorating a full-size.

429
00:22:45.113 --> 00:22:46.823
live-action movie set.

430
00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:49.993
That's the beauty
of stop-motion animation.

431
00:22:50.077 --> 00:22:52.662
Set dec. set design. decoration.

432
00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:56.291
cinematography. they're completely
like a live-action film.

433
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:59.419
Guillermo's very concerned that
things feel and look real.

434
00:22:59.503 --> 00:23:03.465
And so we do reference a lot of
period images if we can find them.

435
00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:05.092
For example. this interior.

436
00:23:05.175 --> 00:23:09.262
If you imagined that
the main source of energy was coal

437
00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:13.141
and wood.
we stained all the walls with coal stains.

438
00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:16.686
So you have to really run it
not by a design machine.

439
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.022
but as a reality machine.

440
00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:21.775
I remember
one of his first visits.

441
00:23:21.858 --> 00:23:23.193
He was looking at the church set

442
00:23:23.276 --> 00:23:26.947
that we had just sort of barely
gotten together by the time he got here.

443
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.908
and he was like. "Yes. We should
age the hell out of this."

444
00:23:29.991 --> 00:23:35.122
We started with the fact that
churches took decades. if not centuries

445
00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:36.456
to be completed.

446
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:41.378
So. the woodwork would be a little lighter
than the frescoes on the walls.

447
00:23:41.461 --> 00:23:46.258
or the stained-glass windows would be
of a different decade or a century.

448
00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:49.469
and the carving of the Christ
took a while.

449
00:23:49.553 --> 00:23:52.180
It needed to feel like the same handiwork

450
00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:55.517
of all the other stuff
in Geppetto's household.

451
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.396
You needed to feel the shaving
of the wood. the shape.

452
00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:04.067
which I wanted to have a parallel
with Pinocchio being carved of wood

453
00:24:04.151 --> 00:24:07.028
and Pinocchio has a hard time figuring out

454
00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:09.448
why the townspeople hate him

455
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:12.409
if he's made of wood and they love Him.

456
00:24:12.492 --> 00:24:14.369
as he says. who is also made of wood.

457
00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:17.164
So. that point could only be done
at the church.

458
00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:31.094
My only worry on this movie was

459
00:24:31.178 --> 00:24:34.306
will I have enough motion control kit

460
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:39.686
to do all the camera movement
that Guillermo will expect on this movie.

461
00:24:39.769 --> 00:24:43.482
Because the later Guillermo films.
the camera just doesn't stop.

462
00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:45.484
We wanted to stage
with the characters

463
00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:46.735
moving around on the camera.

464
00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:50.113
moving around the way you would stage
with actors on a set.

465
00:24:50.197 --> 00:24:53.158
In some instances.
we move the camera quite a bit.

466
00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:56.703
For example. one single shot
took three months.

467
00:24:57.287 --> 00:25:00.582
There's a shot where
Spazzatura is headed back to the carnival

468
00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:03.335
where he sort of runs down.
and the camera follows him

469
00:25:03.418 --> 00:25:05.629
traversing the carnival grounds

470
00:25:05.712 --> 00:25:07.756
and ending up in Volpe's wagon.

471
00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:11.009
A shot like that.
it tells you so much

472
00:25:11.092 --> 00:25:14.554
'cause you really see
the way that Spazzatura moves.

473
00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:17.098
It tells you something
about his character.

474
00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:20.685
It also tells you about
the environment that he's from.

475
00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:22.312
It tells you about the circus.

476
00:25:22.395 --> 00:25:25.440
And we also get to meet
some of the other characters

477
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:28.693
who are in the background
as he sort of passes through.

478
00:25:29.277 --> 00:25:32.948
A lot of Guillermo's movies
are hyperreality.

479
00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:35.075
So. you use the light

480
00:25:35.158 --> 00:25:38.954
just to accent
the emotional content of a scene.

481
00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:43.375
so having some cloud movement
is such an assist for telling the story.

482
00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:47.629
Like with Geppetto
when he is chopping down the tree.

483
00:25:47.712 --> 00:25:51.758
It helps to reflect
Geppetto's agonized state.

484
00:25:51.841 --> 00:25:54.135
so we can really amp up the drama.

485
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.181
One of the things
which we had not done before

486
00:25:58.723 --> 00:26:04.104
was when Volpe is
burning Pinocchio on the fire.

487
00:26:04.187 --> 00:26:08.692
We were able to have a torch
with LED lights inside the torch.

488
00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:12.487
so that as Volpe moves the torch around.

489
00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:15.532
we were able to have
a separate pass for that light

490
00:26:15.615 --> 00:26:17.409
and to give it multiple exposures.

491
00:26:18.368 --> 00:26:19.786
Give me that torch. Spazzatura.

492
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.872
Because normally.
you'd always have to fake that up

493
00:26:22.956 --> 00:26:24.499
with moving lights or stage.

494
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:26.167
and this was an opportunity for us

495
00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:29.004
to really control that
in the post process.

496
00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:31.047
We could keep the moonlight separate

497
00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:34.634
and just have all of that
torch light and fire light

498
00:26:34.718 --> 00:26:36.094
on separate passes.

499
00:26:36.177 --> 00:26:38.513
You will burn. Burn bright!

500
00:26:39.222 --> 00:26:40.849
Like a star!

501
00:26:41.808 --> 00:26:44.060
-Ow! Help!

502
00:26:44.144 --> 00:26:47.897
It's amazing how the character
designs and the actors themselves

503
00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:49.399
inform each other.

504
00:26:49.482 --> 00:26:52.652
and then the actual animator
informs it as well.

505
00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:55.322
By the time that
the animator gets the puppet.

506
00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:57.657
the animator has the voice tracks.

507
00:26:58.241 --> 00:27:00.785
The thing with Pinocchio
that I love

508
00:27:00.869 --> 00:27:03.538
is the idea of it embodying

509
00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:07.751
any four-year-old. six-year-old
that are balls of energy

510
00:27:07.834 --> 00:27:09.753
-that nobody can control.
-Oh!

511
00:27:09.836 --> 00:27:11.963
When they're sad.
you understand they're sad.

512
00:27:12.047 --> 00:27:14.674
and they can be
on the verge of tears one second

513
00:27:14.758 --> 00:27:17.093
and incredibly happy two seconds later.

514
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:20.555
As we came to find out with Gregory.

515
00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:24.476
you have a very short lifespan
in the recording sessions.

516
00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:25.769
but it was all true.

517
00:27:25.852 --> 00:27:28.813
My process at the beginning.
I was very nervous.

518
00:27:28.897 --> 00:27:29.814
I've never done

519
00:27:30.398 --> 00:27:34.235
anything where I was a really big.
substantial part in the movie.

520
00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:36.404
It was like shooting a documentary.

521
00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:38.573
Whenever he started acting.

522
00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:41.743
we did a little thing that…

523
00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:45.038
…it was very easy for him
to shake out the acting.

524
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:48.291
I said… I would say
he would call me a dummy.

525
00:27:48.375 --> 00:27:51.544
He said that
if I said "dummy" at the end of a line.

526
00:27:51.628 --> 00:27:54.297
even though we wouldn't
probably put it in the final cut.

527
00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:56.591
it made me put
a lot more emphasis into it.

528
00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:58.551
especially on some of the funnier lines.

529
00:27:58.635 --> 00:28:01.471
And every time he got a little too actory.

530
00:28:01.554 --> 00:28:03.473
he would say. "Shut up. dummy!"

531
00:28:03.556 --> 00:28:06.101
And then he would laugh it out.
and he would continue.

532
00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:09.354
I'm made of flesh and bone and meaty bits.

533
00:28:09.437 --> 00:28:10.605
I'm a real boy.

534
00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:13.233
He's really good at being natural.

535
00:28:13.316 --> 00:28:16.569
but he is incredibly intimate
when he's whispering

536
00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:18.697
or talking to the cricket

537
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.365
or talking to Candlewick.

538
00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:24.369
There is an absolute pure emotion there.

539
00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:26.996
Fathers feel despair. like everyone else.

540
00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:31.084
And they say things
they only think they mean in the moment.

541
00:28:31.835 --> 00:28:33.670
But inside they love you.

542
00:28:34.337 --> 00:28:37.966
Well. I think this is
my third project with David Bradley.

543
00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:40.969
and it's because I admire him very much.

544
00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:45.348
I think he's an actor that has
an easily identifiable sound.

545
00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:48.309
No one talks to the Podestà like that.

546
00:28:49.102 --> 00:28:55.316
I approached the script by finding
some kind of vocal quality

547
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.819
that was believable and truthful.

548
00:28:57.902 --> 00:29:02.323
but something that tells
the story and it's more vivid

549
00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:05.076
and more capturing

550
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.288
the essence of this character.

551
00:29:08.371 --> 00:29:12.250
He goes high. and he goes low really fast.
"Why are you saying that?"

552
00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:13.877
You know. he really is…

553
00:29:14.711 --> 00:29:17.756
It's almost like a musical thing he has.

554
00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:21.050
A son knows when his father is alive.

555
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.845
He will look for us. You'll see.

556
00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:26.431
You have nothing to worry about.

557
00:29:26.514 --> 00:29:28.850
Easy for you to say.

558
00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:32.187
I wasn't convinced of Cricket
when we started the film.

559
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.646
Just as a character.

560
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:38.359
As soon as Ewan started voicing it.
I was like. "Okay. I'm on board."

561
00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:44.073
We… We made it!

562
00:29:44.157 --> 00:29:45.617
I can't believe it!

563
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.495
I'm a massive fan
of Ewan McGregor.

564
00:29:48.578 --> 00:29:51.873
and when he talks.
he's so relatable but warm.

565
00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:55.502
And I said.
"We cannot have enough of this voice."

566
00:29:55.585 --> 00:29:57.086
Well. I've tried my best.

567
00:29:57.587 --> 00:29:59.380
and that's the best anyone can do.

568
00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:00.840
Pinocchio taught me that.

569
00:30:00.924 --> 00:30:04.469
And I thought that should be
the main character of the film.

570
00:30:04.552 --> 00:30:06.387
the narrator character.

571
00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:09.682
And we rewrote the scenes
emphasizing the cricket

572
00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:11.559
even if he was just watching.

573
00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:16.773
I think the sessions with Ewan have been
the best character voice sessions

574
00:30:16.856 --> 00:30:18.358
I've ever had in my life.

575
00:30:18.441 --> 00:30:21.736
I am Count Volpe. You have been chosen!

576
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.573
Come partake in the fun.
fanciful. carefree carnival life

577
00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:29.077
as the star of my puppet show.

578
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:34.791
We knew that Volpe needed to be
glitzy. cosmopolitan. appealing.

579
00:30:34.874 --> 00:30:36.751
sound like a man of the world.

580
00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:39.295
We wanted him to have an accent.

581
00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:42.423
but have a voice
that could pronounce flawlessly

582
00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:45.718
a word in French.
a word in Italian. a word in German.

583
00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:49.556
Puppets are <i>le meilleur qui soit.</i>
The tops!

584
00:30:50.473 --> 00:30:51.391
Lift your arm.

585
00:30:51.474 --> 00:30:54.352
Puppets are well respected
in every station of life.

586
00:30:54.435 --> 00:30:58.606
The only voice that came to mind
was Christoph Waltz.

587
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.526
Talk about a guy that can change

588
00:31:01.609 --> 00:31:04.487
the rhythm and the intention of a sound
in mid-phrase.

589
00:31:04.571 --> 00:31:07.699
That's a dramatic function.
so to say.

590
00:31:08.283 --> 00:31:12.120
And I always look for
the function in the story.

591
00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:14.622
He really knows how to vary things

592
00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:16.833
and then just punch at the right moment.

593
00:31:16.916 --> 00:31:19.919
-What are you doing here?

594
00:31:22.338 --> 00:31:26.134
The voice of Spazzatura.
which will come as a big surprise.

595
00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:31.264
was almost a blessing and an accident
that I could not foresee.

596
00:31:31.347 --> 00:31:33.099
We were shooting <i>Nightmare Alley.</i>

597
00:31:33.182 --> 00:31:35.685
Cate Blanchett and I
were having such a good time

598
00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:39.439
that she said.
"You gotta give me a part on <i>Pinocchio</i>."

599
00:31:39.522 --> 00:31:42.317
I go. "The only part left is a monkey."

600
00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:44.861
And…

601
00:31:44.944 --> 00:31:46.905
And I went. "I would do anything."

602
00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:50.575
"I would play a pencil
in a movie for you."

603
00:31:50.658 --> 00:31:53.703
And I showed her the design
for Spazzatura. and she said.

604
00:31:53.786 --> 00:31:56.247
"I think this is my spirit animal."

605
00:31:56.331 --> 00:31:59.042
When Spazzatura gets shot out of the sky.

606
00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:01.002
do you want a little .

607
00:32:01.544 --> 00:32:03.212
Like in the distance.

608
00:32:03.296 --> 00:32:05.882
I think there's something of
Guillermo's laugh…

609
00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.010
…that's in Spazzatura.

610
00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:11.804
But I think all the characters
in Guillermo's movies.

611
00:32:11.888 --> 00:32:15.558
all of us feel that they're in the eye of
Guillermo as the beholder.

612
00:32:15.642 --> 00:32:18.686
So. I think there's probably
qualities of Guillermo

613
00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.732
in all of the characters.
And Spazzatura is. yeah. case in point.

614
00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:29.739
Normally. when you're watching
a piece of animation

615
00:32:29.822 --> 00:32:31.199
which has music in it.

616
00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:33.534
you can feel the songs coming up.

617
00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:36.746
It's almost like the dialogue is
a ramp for the music.

618
00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:45.254
Whereas the songs spring out
of Guillermo's <i>Pinocchio</i>

619
00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:46.923
completely by surprise.

620
00:32:47.006 --> 00:32:48.049
Meh.

621
00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:51.260
These puppets gave me the desire of not

622
00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:56.975
doing an animation movie.
but doing like a real live-action film.

623
00:32:57.058 --> 00:32:59.143
It's the same for me
'cause they look alive.

624
00:32:59.227 --> 00:33:01.270
They all look like real people.

625
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.149
So. I tried the music to be playing
like it was a real person's.

626
00:33:05.233 --> 00:33:07.860
We like to describe this
not necessarily as a musical.

627
00:33:07.944 --> 00:33:09.946
It's a film with musical moments.

628
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:12.490
They're not traditional musical songs.
they're not pop songs.

629
00:33:12.573 --> 00:33:15.368
They're just sort of
what you would think of. if you think

630
00:33:15.451 --> 00:33:17.412
of Alexandre and Guillermo and Mark.

631
00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:20.915
All those genius minds together
is something totally unique.

632
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:25.169
When Alexandre and I were talking.
I thought it would be interesting

633
00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:28.214
to start the movie
with characters that sing

634
00:33:28.297 --> 00:33:29.549
but end up…

635
00:33:29.632 --> 00:33:34.053
The second half of the movie has
fascist-era songs and marches.

636
00:33:34.137 --> 00:33:35.763
This movie was a very long process

637
00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:38.975
because. of course.
the animation takes a lot of time.

638
00:33:39.058 --> 00:33:40.435
but also because

639
00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:43.229
Guillermo wanted me to write songs
for the characters.

640
00:33:43.896 --> 00:33:46.649
and a song has this capacity

641
00:33:46.733 --> 00:33:50.820
in a few seconds
to explain the life of a character.

642
00:33:51.612 --> 00:33:53.781
They give the tone musically.

643
00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:57.326
Also. they give information about
who they are. where they are.

644
00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:59.579
where they come from.
and where they're going.

645
00:33:59.662 --> 00:34:03.041
I admire Alexandre Desplat.

646
00:34:03.124 --> 00:34:06.961
He is a consummate movie composer.

647
00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:10.840
He does the same thing
that I do with parts.

648
00:34:10.923 --> 00:34:12.675
He looks at the story.

649
00:34:13.342 --> 00:34:17.388
For the whole film.
I've chosen to use only wood instruments.

650
00:34:17.972 --> 00:34:21.225
So. you have the guitars. the mandolin.

651
00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:24.395
the piano. the harp.
and all the woodwinds.

652
00:34:24.479 --> 00:34:26.814
The bassoons. the clarinets.
the oboes. the flutes.

653
00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:28.399
All these instruments are in wood

654
00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:32.445
which creates a very strange environment
that belongs to Pinocchio.

655
00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:36.365
No!

656
00:34:39.952 --> 00:34:42.288
This movie. you could watch
in a double program

657
00:34:42.371 --> 00:34:44.457
with <i>Pan's</i> and <i>Devil's Backbone </i>easily.

658
00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:49.545
It has a lot of elements
with a pure soul being tested

659
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:52.340
and coming out on the other side strong.

660
00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:55.426
As I see it.
you were charged with a burden.

661
00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:58.221
This is a film about death.

662
00:34:58.304 --> 00:35:01.390
You don't have a film about life
if you don't have a film about death.

663
00:35:02.058 --> 00:35:03.059
Very well then.

664
00:35:03.851 --> 00:35:06.187
When we started to tackle
this <i>Pinocchio.</i>

665
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.940
I knew I wanted to do my own version.

666
00:35:09.023 --> 00:35:12.568
I didn't want to address
just an adaptation.

667
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:17.365
I wanted to talk about things that
touched me personally very deeply.

668
00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:21.202
Most of my movies. one way or another.
deal with me and my father.

669
00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:23.329
and this is not an exception.

670
00:35:23.913 --> 00:35:29.335
You watch this boy grow up.
never physically changing.

671
00:35:29.418 --> 00:35:30.670
But yet.

672
00:35:30.753 --> 00:35:34.382
the realization that he can do far more
than anyone else around him.

673
00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.218
Now. make the most of it.

674
00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:41.055
Normally. <i>Pinocchio</i> is about
what Pinocchio learns in the world

675
00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:44.267
and then becomes a good boy
and therefore becomes a real boy.

676
00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.185
and our <i>Pinocchio</i> is not that.

677
00:35:46.269 --> 00:35:49.647
He changes everyone because he is so pure.

678
00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:51.858
He changes Geppetto.

679
00:35:52.567 --> 00:35:53.818
He changes the cricket.

680
00:35:54.402 --> 00:35:57.113
He changes Spazzatura.
He changes everyone.

681
00:35:57.196 --> 00:36:01.367
And he learns who he is as a human being.

682
00:36:06.414 --> 00:36:08.916
I think the film exceeded
everything I wanted.

683
00:36:09.917 --> 00:36:12.378
It's a movie
I would've loved to have as a kid.

684
00:36:12.879 --> 00:36:15.423
It's a movie I'd love to have as an adult.

685
00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:18.551
It's a movie I would love to have
to discuss with the family.

686
00:36:18.634 --> 00:36:21.846
and the possibility of seeing it
on command

687
00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:24.223
after experiencing it for the first time.

688
00:36:24.307 --> 00:36:26.559
it's something that creates
an intimate bond

689
00:36:26.642 --> 00:36:28.269
between the viewer and the film.

690
00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:31.939
It certainly grows for me
with every viewing.

691
00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:34.525
and I hope it does that with the audience.
