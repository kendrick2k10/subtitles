00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:36.663
[birds squawk]

5
00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:19.205
[Abigail] Tuesday.
January 1st. 1856.

6
00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:29.682
Fair and very cold.

7
00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:34.587
This morning.

8
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.490
ice in our bedroom
for the first time all winter.

9
00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.203
[distant shouting]

10
00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:58.578
[sheep bleating]

11
00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.798
[Abigail] The water froze
on the potatoes

12
00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.533
as soon as they were washed.

13
00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:25.772
With little pride.
and less hope.

14
00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:28.441
we begin the new year.

15
00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:31.978
[humming]

16
00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.146
[Abigail] On the porch
after sunup.

17
00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:35.514
I could hear the low chirping
of sparrows

18
00:03:35.547 --> 00:03:38.284
in the hedgerows that are
now buried in the snow.

19
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:49.796
[sniffle]

20
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.670

[chickens clucking]

23
00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:18.391
[Abigail] Dyer has maintained
that with good health.

24
00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.059
and a level head.

25
00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:21.727
there is always
an excellent chance

26
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.429
for a farmer willing to work.

27
00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.446
He feels he can never fully
rid himself of his burdens.

28
00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:45.584
And I'm certain that because
his mind is in such a bad state.

29
00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:47.453
it affects his whole system.

30
00:04:49.588 --> 00:04:50.623
[sniffing]

31
00:04:52.124 --> 00:04:53.559

32
00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:57.797
[cows mooing]

33
00:05:15.047 --> 00:05:16.415
[Abigail] He told me
this morning

34
00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.719
that contentment was like
a friend he never gets to see.

35
00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:22.588
You're late with the milking.

36
00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:23.790
She wasn't suffering.

37
00:05:25.424 --> 00:05:26.459
And you?

38
00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:35.735
[crows cawing]

39
00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:43.909
[Abigail]Since our acquisition
of this farm.

40
00:05:43.942 --> 00:05:47.513
my husband had kept a ledger
to help him see the year whole.

41
00:05:49.114 --> 00:05:51.484
This way he knows what each crop

42
00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:54.587
and field pays
from year to year.

43
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.857
And Dyer has asked me
to keep a diary of matters

44
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.426
that might otherwise
go overlooked...

45
00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:06.499
From tools lent out
to bills outstanding.

46
00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:09.902
That I have done.

47
00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:15.875
But there would be no record
in these dull and simple pages

48
00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:17.810
of the most passionate
circumstances

49
00:06:17.843 --> 00:06:19.445
of our seasons past.

50
00:06:20.078 --> 00:06:22.448
[fire crackling]

51
00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:25.051
No record of our emotions
or fears.

52
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.787
Our greatest joys.

53
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:30.757
Our most piercing sorrows.

54
00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:43.169
With our child.

55
00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:45.671
it was as if I'd found
my bearings.

56
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.077
But I too rarely told her
that she was our treasure.

57
00:06:53.712 --> 00:06:54.781
Would you like to try?

58
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.886
Like this. papa?

59
00:07:02.154 --> 00:07:03.189
That's it.

60
00:07:05.724 --> 00:07:08.160
[Abigail] She often seemed
separate from us.

61
00:07:08.193 --> 00:07:11.831
as if she was working at
just fitting in where she could.

62
00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:16.035
They saw his brothers
and sisters

63
00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:18.037
and they were
the mouse's family...

64
00:07:19.838 --> 00:07:21.507
[Abigail] There is something
so affecting

65
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.876
about mute and motionless grief
and illness

66
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:25.544
in a child so young.

67
00:07:25.577 --> 00:07:28.881
-[coughing]
-[heavy breathing]

68
00:07:28.914 --> 00:07:31.717
She put her arms around me
and said nothing else.

69
00:07:36.288 --> 00:07:38.491
But it felt like
we were speaking.

70
00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:51.937
[thud]

71
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.875
-[strained breathing]
-[soft singing]

72
00:08:05.684 --> 00:08:09.856
[humming]

73
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.184
[deep sigh]

74
00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:44.990
[distant sobbing]

75
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.731
[ominous music]

76
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:08.374
[Abigail] I have become
my grief.

77
00:10:13.712 --> 00:10:16.348
I have become my grief.

78
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:20.252
[church bell tolling]

79
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.989
[Abigail] "Welcome sweet
day of rest".

80
00:10:24.022 --> 00:10:26.792
says the hymn.

81
00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:31.764
And Sunday is most welcome
for its few hours of quiet ease.

82
00:10:32.998 --> 00:10:34.033
As for me.

83
00:10:35.033 --> 00:10:36.769
I no longer attend.

84
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.940
After the calamity
of Nellie's loss.

85
00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:44.143
what calm I enjoy

86
00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:47.680
does not derive from the notion
of a better world to come.

87
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.719
I want to purchase an atlas.

88
00:10:55.854 --> 00:10:57.857
-[man 1] It could be a bother.
-[man 2] No. no. No bother.

89
00:10:59.157 --> 00:11:02.795
-[horses huffing]
-[wood creaking]

90
00:11:08.066 --> 00:11:09.068
Who is that?

91
00:11:10.001 --> 00:11:11.070
[Dyer] His name is Finney.

92
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.007
-His wife Tallie.
-Hyah!

93
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.141
[Dyer] I met them
at the feed store.

94
00:11:16.174 --> 00:11:17.877
They seem to keep to themselves.

95
00:11:20.378 --> 00:11:22.048
They're renting the Zebrun farm.

96
00:11:26.885 --> 00:11:29.055
[gentle music]

97
00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:38.431
[Abigail]Monday. February 4th.

98
00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:42.935
Why is ink like fire?

99
00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:44.369
[deep sigh]

100
00:11:44.402 --> 00:11:46.038
Because it is a good servant.

101
00:11:47.005 --> 00:11:48.507
and a hard master.

102
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.809
[grinding]

103
00:11:54.412 --> 00:11:55.748
Did you say something?

104
00:11:58.083 --> 00:11:59.919
I want to purchase an atlas.

105
00:12:07.492 --> 00:12:09.928
I suppose there are more
frivolous purchases

106
00:12:09.961 --> 00:12:10.996
one could make.

107
00:12:17.502 --> 00:12:19.138
I've saved 90 cents of my own.

108
00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:21.373
I can't imagine a better way
to spend it.

109
00:12:25.277 --> 00:12:27.179
Could buy your husband a gift.

110
00:12:31.983 --> 00:12:33.352
What better gift
could I give him

111
00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:35.488
than a wife
who is no longer a dullard?

112
00:12:40.859 --> 00:12:41.960
[Abigail] My self-education

113
00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:44.997
seems the only way
to keep my unhappiness

114
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.365
from overwhelming me.

115
00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:53.973
[pigs grunting]

116
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.479
[somber music]

117
00:13:13.491 --> 00:13:16.862
[pigs squealing]

118
00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:32.444
[squelches]

119
00:13:59.037 --> 00:14:00.172
Good afternoon.

120
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:06.211
I've been using a broom
on my porch.

121
00:14:06.244 --> 00:14:07.346
The snow is so dry.

122
00:14:10.348 --> 00:14:11.350
I'm Tallie.

123
00:14:13.351 --> 00:14:14.386
Abigail.

124
00:14:18.123 --> 00:14:19.391
I hope I'm not intruding.

125
00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:20.992
No.

126
00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:23.528
I just. I needed to get away
for the day.

127
00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:25.364
The farm is a slaughterhouse
right now.

128
00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:27.032
My husband is killing his hogs.

129
00:14:32.337 --> 00:14:33.505
Would you like to come in?

130
00:14:34.572 --> 00:14:35.875
Yes. I'd love that.

131
00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:42.181
Or we could just stay
out on the porch. shivering.

132
00:14:47.118 --> 00:14:48.420
I know it's the dullest
of all things

133
00:14:48.453 --> 00:14:49.988
to have an ignorant neighbor
come by

134
00:14:50.021 --> 00:14:51.590
and spoil a Sunday afternoon.

135
00:14:51.623 --> 00:14:53.458
Oh. no.
you're the most welcome here.

136
00:14:53.491 --> 00:14:55.961
But I know the feeling.

137
00:14:55.994 --> 00:14:58.630
Sometimes. I imagine during
the Widow Weldon's visits

138
00:14:58.663 --> 00:15:02.434
that I've been plunged up to
my eyes in a vat of the prosaic.

139
00:15:02.467 --> 00:15:04.102
Oh. Widow Weldon!

140
00:15:04.135 --> 00:15:05.704
She got going on the county
levy once...

141
00:15:05.737 --> 00:15:08.440
[Abigail] She saw
I had noticed her hair.

142
00:15:08.473 --> 00:15:11.176
and admitted she had been vain
about it as a girl.

143
00:15:11.209 --> 00:15:14.112
She said that back then.
she'd worn it longer

144
00:15:14.145 --> 00:15:17.049
and plaited in a bun
at the back of her head.

145
00:15:19.484 --> 00:15:22.421
In the winter sun
through the window.

146
00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:25.324
her skin had an underflush
of rose and violet

147
00:15:25.357 --> 00:15:29.161
which so disconcerted me
that I had to look away.

148
00:15:34.032 --> 00:15:35.167
As always.

149
00:15:36.267 --> 00:15:38.036
when it came to speaking

150
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:41.974
and attempting to engage
another's affections.

151
00:15:42.007 --> 00:15:45.577
circumstances doomed me
to striving and anxiety.

152
00:15:47.412 --> 00:15:51.550
From my earliest youth.
I was like a pot-bound root.

153
00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:53.986
all curled in upon itself.

154
00:15:54.019 --> 00:15:56.188
I hope I'm not keeping you
from something.

155
00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:57.222
No.

156
00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.327
I'm glad you've come.

157
00:16:03.428 --> 00:16:06.031
Finney saw your husband
at the cooperage.

158
00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:08.467
He mentioned his new method
for farrowing his piglets.

159
00:16:10.035 --> 00:16:12.604
With some asperity?

160
00:16:12.637 --> 00:16:15.174
My husband mentions everything
with some asperity.

161
00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:19.311
I told him that once.

162
00:16:20.345 --> 00:16:21.546
and...

163
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.082
he observed in response that
it seemed to be quite a favor

164
00:16:24.115 --> 00:16:25.584
to get a kind word from me.

165
00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:27.419
And I told him that if he
was married to himself.

166
00:16:27.452 --> 00:16:29.488
he'd soon find out
what a favor it was.

167
00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:31.156
[soft laugh]

168
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:32.591
My mother always said
that having children

169
00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:34.126
would resolve that dilemma.

170
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.096
My mother made the same claim.

171
00:16:39.664 --> 00:16:40.699
And yet...

172
00:16:41.766 --> 00:16:43.068
Here we are...

173
00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:45.771
Both childless.

174
00:16:47.672 --> 00:16:50.308
[fire crackling]

175
00:16:50.341 --> 00:16:52.578
My daughter. Nellie.
would have been five today.

176
00:16:54.646 --> 00:16:56.615
Oh.

177
00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.017
How did she pass?

178
00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:02.587
Diphtheria.

179
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.789
Last September.

180
00:17:05.757 --> 00:17:07.159
I'm so sorry.

181
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.495
[door opens]

182
00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:16.268
-Hello.
-Oh.

183
00:17:16.734 --> 00:17:17.736
Good afternoon.

184
00:17:18.436 --> 00:17:19.438
I'm Dyer.

185
00:17:20.738 --> 00:17:21.740
Tallie.

186
00:17:27.612 --> 00:17:29.548
Oh. it's late. isn't it?
I should be getting on.

187
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:33.118
Don't go on my account.

188
00:17:33.151 --> 00:17:34.186
Oh. no.

189
00:17:36.554 --> 00:17:38.256
That's a nice wrap you have.

190
00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:40.092
Thank you.

191
00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:42.194
I never receive compliments
for my clothes.

192
00:17:44.562 --> 00:17:45.764
[Dyer coughing]

193
00:17:47.432 --> 00:17:49.234
I'm so glad you've come.

194
00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:50.702
Meeting you has made my day.

195
00:17:51.436 --> 00:17:52.438
It has?

196
00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:55.207
Well...

197
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.243
How pleasant and uncommon
it is to make someone's day.

198
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:02.481
Thursday. February 14th.

199
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:06.618
Dyer's third night
with the fever.

200
00:18:06.651 --> 00:18:09.288
[heavy coughing]

201
00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:11.590
Drink this.

202
00:18:12.357 --> 00:18:14.426
[Dyer coughing]

203
00:18:28.773 --> 00:18:30.776
I plan on getting sick
more often.

204
00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:34.346
My wife smiles at me.

205
00:18:39.717 --> 00:18:43.355
[coughing continues]

206
00:18:43.388 --> 00:18:45.124
Promise me you're not gonna die.

207
00:18:46.624 --> 00:18:48.326
[deep breath]

208
00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:50.729
That would be the opposite
of my intention.

209
00:18:57.335 --> 00:18:58.570
[Abigail] I've restored
him somewhat

210
00:18:58.603 --> 00:19:00.338
with an enema of molasses.

211
00:19:00.371 --> 00:19:01.874
warm water and lard.

212
00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:06.545
Also a drop of turpentine
next to his nose.

213
00:19:09.814 --> 00:19:13.485
I spent the day reconsidering
my conversation with Tallie.

214
00:19:15.486 --> 00:19:18.256
We compared childhood beds...

215
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:19.390
Mine in which the straw

216
00:19:19.424 --> 00:19:22.527
was always breaking up
and thinning out.

217
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.764
And hers. which was as hard.
she claimed.

218
00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:27.499
as the Pharaoh's heart.

219
00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:33.372
[Dyer] I should be
taking care of you.

220
00:19:34.772 --> 00:19:35.774
I agree.

221
00:19:37.775 --> 00:19:39.845
[soft giggling]

222
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:47.652
[Abigail] Her manner is sweet
and calm and gracious.

223
00:19:47.685 --> 00:19:49.588
And yet her spirits
seem to quicken

224
00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:52.457
at the prospect of
further conversation with me.

225
00:19:55.026 --> 00:19:57.362
I find that everything
I wish to tell her

226
00:19:57.395 --> 00:20:00.232
loses its eloquence
in her presence.

227
00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:05.470
So how did you come
to meet Dyer?

228
00:20:05.503 --> 00:20:07.405
He was the oldest son
of a neighbor.

229
00:20:07.438 --> 00:20:09.241
He helped out
on my father's farm.

230
00:20:10.341 --> 00:20:12.477
And was he instantly smitten
by you?

231
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.812
[scoffs]

232
00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:14.980
He was. wasn't he?

233
00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:16.815
He was instantly smitten by you.

234
00:20:20.785 --> 00:20:25.490
He admired what he viewed
as my practical good sense.

235
00:20:25.523 --> 00:20:28.960
You don't countenance words
like "smitten". do you?

236
00:20:28.993 --> 00:20:31.296
I suspect I use
all the same words you do.

237
00:20:31.329 --> 00:20:33.465
I suspect you don't.

238
00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:35.267
In speech.
yes. because you're shy.

239
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.002
But I bet you're more
accomplished in your writing.

240
00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:43.675
Thank you.

241
00:20:45.943 --> 00:20:49.414
Your good sense. that's all
your husband was smitten with?

242
00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.253
And my efficient habits.

243
00:20:55.386 --> 00:20:56.421
That's all?

244
00:20:56.954 --> 00:20:58.423
My handy ways.

245
00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.529
Dyer likes mechanical things.

246
00:21:06.998 --> 00:21:08.533
I have no doubt he would've
been happier

247
00:21:08.566 --> 00:21:09.968
had he been allowed to pursue

248
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:12.871
the natural scientific bent
of his mind.

249
00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:15.040
Circumstances forced him
into farming.

250
00:21:16.674 --> 00:21:20.045
And despite all of that.
his heart compelled him to you?

251
00:21:23.448 --> 00:21:25.450
Well...

252
00:21:25.483 --> 00:21:28.486
You would have to ask him
about that.

253
00:21:28.519 --> 00:21:30.355
And what would you say
if I asked you?

254
00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:42.968
I suppose that as a suitor.
he was...

255
00:21:44.068 --> 00:21:47.038
not generous. but he was just.

256
00:21:47.071 --> 00:21:50.375
And that he was affectionate.
if not constant.

257
00:21:59.517 --> 00:22:01.453
I wasn't sure
of his suitability.

258
00:22:05.857 --> 00:22:08.393
But my family felt that more
improving

259
00:22:08.426 --> 00:22:09.494
might be in the offing.

260
00:22:11.662 --> 00:22:14.533
After all. it is a long lane
that has no turning.

261
00:22:20.004 --> 00:22:22.674
You both have much
to be thankful for.

262
00:22:25.676 --> 00:22:26.712
We do.

263
00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:47.132
It's still too soon.

264
00:22:50.802 --> 00:22:51.670
Sorry.

265
00:22:51.703 --> 00:22:54.706
[Abigail]
Tuesday. February 19th.

266
00:22:55.907 --> 00:22:58.677
[deep breath]

267
00:23:02.713 --> 00:23:06.851
My reluctance seems
to have become his shame.

268
00:23:06.884 --> 00:23:10.822
His nighttime pleasures.
which were never numerous.

269
00:23:10.855 --> 00:23:13.591
have curtailed even more.

270
00:23:13.624 --> 00:23:17.462
And I have so far refused
to engage his persistence

271
00:23:17.495 --> 00:23:19.464
on the subject of another child.

272
00:23:54.065 --> 00:23:55.066
[Dyer] Evening.

273
00:23:56.501 --> 00:23:57.836
[Tallie] This is my
husband Finney.

274
00:23:57.869 --> 00:23:58.903
And you already know Dyer.

275
00:23:58.936 --> 00:23:59.971
Our paths have crossed.

276
00:24:00.004 --> 00:24:02.574
And this is the Abigail
that I've been mentioning.

277
00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:04.642
My wife talks about you as
if you're all about the house.

278
00:24:04.675 --> 00:24:05.876
and everything
reminds her of you.

279
00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.913
Oh. well. it's all I can do
but sit cross-legged and morose

280
00:24:08.946 --> 00:24:09.981
whenever she's away.

281
00:24:11.582 --> 00:24:13.651
-Come in.
-Thank you.

282
00:24:13.684 --> 00:24:16.455
The rain so heavy
that it broke down our mill.

283
00:24:20.758 --> 00:24:21.793
Did you miss me?

284
00:24:23.027 --> 00:24:24.062
Yes.

285
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:26.765
You look different.

286
00:24:28.032 --> 00:24:29.100
No...

287
00:24:29.133 --> 00:24:30.202
[soft laugh]

288
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.839
Finney seems agreeable.

289
00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:38.543
Yes. he is.
when he chooses to be.

290
00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:45.016
[deep breath]

291
00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:48.920
[chuckles]

292
00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.059
[Finney] I guess I'm
supposed to offer a toast.

293
00:24:55.092 --> 00:24:56.327
But when it comes
to the social graces.

294
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.297
I'm about as smooth as coming
down a rocky hill in the dark.

295
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.032
What my husband means
is he's so happy

296
00:25:01.065 --> 00:25:02.200
to finally get together.

297
00:25:02.233 --> 00:25:03.668
and to see Dyer again.

298
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:06.505
[clinking]

299
00:25:06.938 --> 00:25:08.006
Cheers.

300
00:25:10.074 --> 00:25:11.676
Part of what I value
about my wife

301
00:25:11.709 --> 00:25:14.112
is how she taught me to
associate with my fellow beings.

302
00:25:19.116 --> 00:25:21.219
Finney. that's a handsome
neck tie you've chosen.

303
00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:23.021
Thank you.

304
00:25:23.054 --> 00:25:24.189
But with my neck.

305
00:25:24.222 --> 00:25:26.925
my head sticks out like a
chicken in a poultry wagon.

306
00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:28.293
Your tart was
wonderfully savory.

307
00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:29.961
Oh. did you like it?
I'm so glad.

308
00:25:29.994 --> 00:25:31.162
I was worried I wouldn't
have enough eggs

309
00:25:31.195 --> 00:25:33.698
-because we had an accident.
-Oh.

310
00:25:33.731 --> 00:25:36.568
My hired hand pulled down a
box of eggs and broke two dozen.

311
00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:38.236
I announced that he was
unlucky to eggs

312
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:40.171
and no longer allowed
to approach them.

313
00:25:40.204 --> 00:25:43.174
"Unlucky to eggs."
I like that.

314
00:25:43.207 --> 00:25:45.843
I told him that his shirt
had so many holes.

315
00:25:45.876 --> 00:25:47.612
he can make a necklace of it.

316
00:25:47.645 --> 00:25:50.815
Well. we often wish
we could afford a hired hand.

317
00:25:50.848 --> 00:25:53.084
We've suffered a great deal from
the carelessness of hired hands.

318
00:25:53.117 --> 00:25:55.119
Mr. Holt's hired hand is said
to have swum his horse

319
00:25:55.152 --> 00:25:56.921
over the canal despite the cold.

320
00:25:56.954 --> 00:25:57.956
Really?

321
00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.758
Yes.

322
00:26:00.791 --> 00:26:01.960
Winter's been so hard.

323
00:26:01.993 --> 00:26:03.261
sometimes Mrs. Weldon's son

324
00:26:03.294 --> 00:26:05.897
has had to deliver the mail
on skis.

325
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.700
Now our letters can get lost
at breakneck speed.

326
00:26:08.733 --> 00:26:10.969
Did you write letters to Tallie
when you were courting?

327
00:26:12.303 --> 00:26:13.305
I did.

328
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.642
And did Tallie keep them?

329
00:26:20.878 --> 00:26:22.347
Only Tallie knows for sure.

330
00:26:23.347 --> 00:26:25.617
[fire crackling]

331
00:26:30.221 --> 00:26:32.890
[Abigail]Monday. February 25th.

332
00:26:32.923 --> 00:26:34.693
-[man shouting]
-[sheep bleating]

333
00:26:44.835 --> 00:26:47.672
Finney and Tallie's bond
confounds me.

334
00:26:49.373 --> 00:26:51.242
At times. when their eyes meet.

335
00:26:51.275 --> 00:26:55.847
they seem yoked in opposition
to one another.

336
00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.084
while at other times.
there seems a shared regard.

337
00:27:01.452 --> 00:27:03.388
There is something going on
between us

338
00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:05.023
that I cannot unravel.

339
00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:09.694
Hold this here.

340
00:27:16.834 --> 00:27:17.869
Okay.

341
00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:31.816
Thank you.

342
00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.205
[door slams]

343
00:27:57.441 --> 00:27:58.677
Hello. Dyer.

344
00:27:59.744 --> 00:28:00.745
Well. hello.

345
00:28:01.312 --> 00:28:02.880
You're off?

346
00:28:02.913 --> 00:28:04.115
Yes. to town.

347
00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:06.818
Have a good day.

348
00:28:07.785 --> 00:28:09.020
She'll be pleased to see you.

349
00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.123
[cows mooing]

350
00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:16.327
[knocking]

351
00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.299
Happy birthday!

352
00:28:24.101 --> 00:28:25.403
Brought you some things.

353
00:28:29.774 --> 00:28:30.875
Hand-knitted?

354
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:33.010
I hoped you'd like them.

355
00:28:33.043 --> 00:28:34.079
I do.

356
00:28:41.118 --> 00:28:42.153
An Atlas!

357
00:28:47.391 --> 00:28:49.394
The United States of America.

358
00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:55.433
Oh and a little pot of
apple sauce with an egg on top.

359
00:29:01.472 --> 00:29:03.007
My feet are freezing.

360
00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.309
Oh. let me warm them.

361
00:29:08.979 --> 00:29:10.348
[dog barking]

362
00:29:17.121 --> 00:29:18.123
How's Finney?

363
00:29:20.157 --> 00:29:21.159
He's Finney.

364
00:29:33.437 --> 00:29:34.506
Ah. it tickles.

365
00:29:40.578 --> 00:29:44.482
[metal clanking]

366
00:29:44.515 --> 00:29:47.252
My husband records
trespassers in his journals.

367
00:29:48.919 --> 00:29:50.488
And this morning.
when I asked him

368
00:29:50.521 --> 00:29:52.156
what he intends to do
about them.

369
00:29:52.189 --> 00:29:54.359
his response was so unpleasant
that I...

370
00:29:55.559 --> 00:29:57.028
resolved to visit you...

371
00:29:59.129 --> 00:30:00.832
so that there would be something
in my day

372
00:30:00.865 --> 00:30:02.200
other than his meanness.

373
00:30:06.036 --> 00:30:08.940
Dyer thinks he has
many estimable qualities.

374
00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:10.174
[Tallie] He does.

375
00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:13.144
And he also uses a ledger to
keep accounting of whom I visit

376
00:30:13.177 --> 00:30:14.345
and how long I stay.

377
00:30:14.378 --> 00:30:15.613
Why?

378
00:30:15.646 --> 00:30:17.181
I have no idea.

379
00:30:17.214 --> 00:30:18.616
As he's gotten more like this.

380
00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:20.451
I've given up trying
to figure out

381
00:30:20.484 --> 00:30:22.487
all the peculiarities of his...

382
00:30:24.121 --> 00:30:25.423
odd little world.

383
00:30:29.426 --> 00:30:32.463
I suppose he's especially
unhappy with me since...

384
00:30:34.498 --> 00:30:36.267
I'm yet to give him a child.

385
00:30:44.541 --> 00:30:46.077
What does it feel like?

386
00:30:48.345 --> 00:30:50.048
Like nothing at first.

387
00:30:51.148 --> 00:30:54.085
But then when she began
to stir...

388
00:30:54.118 --> 00:30:56.354
it's like butterflies
flapping their wings.

389
00:30:58.589 --> 00:31:01.125
Later. like a rabbit...

390
00:31:01.158 --> 00:31:03.027
when she kicked her legs
at night.

391
00:31:06.497 --> 00:31:07.899
It frightens me.

392
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:15.373
The thought of having
none of that.

393
00:31:21.412 --> 00:31:22.547
And of giving birth.

394
00:31:23.614 --> 00:31:25.416
Most of us feel that way.

395
00:31:28.352 --> 00:31:29.354
But...

396
00:31:30.554 --> 00:31:33.925
when the time comes.
I will be there...

397
00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:35.226
to guide you through it.

398
00:31:44.001 --> 00:31:45.436
Dyer must want another child.

399
00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:53.478
I understand.

400
00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:56.681
[wind whooshing]

401
00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:05.556
[horse neighing]

402
00:32:27.177 --> 00:32:28.179
[door slams]

403
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.448
Birthday gifts.

404
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.320
[heavy breathing]

405
00:32:42.793 --> 00:32:44.329
A box of raisins.

406
00:32:45.729 --> 00:32:47.598
That needle case
you've been needing.

407
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:49.200
And a tin of sardines.

408
00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.102
You spoil me.

409
00:32:53.737 --> 00:32:57.075
Oh. you got gifts
from your new friend.

410
00:33:00.544 --> 00:33:02.013
She left hours ago.

411
00:33:05.115 --> 00:33:06.284
I just saw her leave.

412
00:33:12.356 --> 00:33:16.227
-[wind howling]
-[horse panting]

413
00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.361
[Abigail]The great storm began

414
00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:20.798
with a faint groaning
in the northeast.

415
00:33:20.831 --> 00:33:23.668
It was like a noise
of a locomotive.

416
00:33:24.468 --> 00:33:26.471
[high pitched tone]

417
00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.643
[sheep bleating]

418
00:33:47.391 --> 00:33:51.496
[indistinct shouting]

419
00:34:00.571 --> 00:34:04.042
[grunting]

420
00:34:11.315 --> 00:34:13.317
[wind thrashing]

421
00:34:15.519 --> 00:34:16.788
[indistinct chatter]

422
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:21.426
Help!

423
00:34:22.726 --> 00:34:23.728
[shouting]

424
00:34:36.673 --> 00:34:38.676
[foreboding music]

425
00:34:58.829 --> 00:35:00.631
[man 3] Come closer. girl.

426
00:35:00.664 --> 00:35:02.166
It's warmer over here.

427
00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:17.515
[striking match]

428
00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:25.756
I'm sorry. I'll be going.

429
00:35:25.789 --> 00:35:27.125
You should wait it out.

430
00:35:30.894 --> 00:35:32.196
[groaning]

431
00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:38.136
Come on. mare.

432
00:35:46.376 --> 00:35:48.880
[foreboding music]

433
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.662
Dyer!

434
00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:14.906
Dyer!

435
00:36:25.582 --> 00:36:27.919
[tense music]

436
00:36:38.662 --> 00:36:39.964
Dyer!

437
00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:53.211
[wind thrashing]

438
00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:03.454
[Abigail]How long would it be
before I receive word of Tallie?

439
00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:07.225
How long could I wait?

440
00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:12.797
How long will the feed
in the barn last?

441
00:37:15.932 --> 00:37:18.769
Each cow eats 26 pounds
of forage every day.

442
00:37:19.936 --> 00:37:22.306
You should know that.

443
00:37:22.339 --> 00:37:25.843
They start to skinny down
after three days.

444
00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:28.679
Heard the newspaper predicts
the storm'll let up by then.

445
00:37:28.712 --> 00:37:29.947
But that's probably based on

446
00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.383
an expert's consultation
of a goose bone.

447
00:37:42.759 --> 00:37:43.960
[sighs deeply]

448
00:37:43.994 --> 00:37:47.465
"In a real crisis of nature.
we're all at another's mercy."

449
00:37:47.998 --> 00:37:49.033
Yes.

450
00:37:51.368 --> 00:37:52.369
My mother liked to say.

451
00:37:52.403 --> 00:37:55.039
"We tumble from one
mortification to another."

452
00:38:01.978 --> 00:38:05.049
When I was seven. an earthquake
knocked down our house and barn.

453
00:38:07.584 --> 00:38:08.586
Did I tell you?

454
00:38:09.586 --> 00:38:10.621
Never.

455
00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:13.557
-An earthquake?
-Yes.

456
00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.329
I remember something woke me
before dawn.

457
00:38:18.362 --> 00:38:19.563
I don't know what.

458
00:38:21.665 --> 00:38:23.000
My father was calling out.

459
00:38:25.902 --> 00:38:29.473
But I couldn't tear myself
away from the window.

460
00:38:29.506 --> 00:38:33.811
I saw birds fluttering
in the air. afraid to set down.

461
00:38:33.844 --> 00:38:36.380
The river was roiling.
and I couldn't move.

462
00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:39.417
And then...

463
00:38:44.154 --> 00:38:47.658
Finally. I jumped down
to our collapsed stairwell.

464
00:38:49.793 --> 00:38:51.695
as all my brothers
had done before me.

465
00:38:51.728 --> 00:38:54.065
And we all huddled together
in the dark on the porch.

466
00:39:04.474 --> 00:39:05.909
Later. my mother said

467
00:39:05.942 --> 00:39:08.746
that the dread never fully
went away after that.

468
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.953
She said. "What was safe if
the solid earth could do that?"

469
00:39:19.189 --> 00:39:22.927
[deep breath]
Mother.

470
00:39:32.502 --> 00:39:35.906
[rapid breathing]

471
00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:43.147
Tallie! You're frozen!

472
00:39:48.718 --> 00:39:51.588
Tallie! Stay awake!
Stay awake!

473
00:39:51.621 --> 00:39:53.591
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

474
00:39:55.225 --> 00:39:57.495
[blowing]

475
00:39:58.995 --> 00:39:59.997
Keep your eyes open!

476
00:40:00.864 --> 00:40:01.866
Keep your eyes open!

477
00:40:03.733 --> 00:40:04.969
Look at me.

478
00:40:07.103 --> 00:40:08.839
I would die without you.

479
00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:17.548
Then you're safe.

480
00:40:19.649 --> 00:40:20.885
Because I am here.

481
00:40:22.986 --> 00:40:25.089
[Abigail] Monday. March 17th.

482
00:40:41.271 --> 00:40:44.174
Half the chickens are lost.

483
00:40:44.207 --> 00:40:47.811
I dug ice and snow
from their dead open mouths

484
00:40:47.844 --> 00:40:50.481
in an attempt to revive them.

485
00:40:56.853 --> 00:40:59.723
[splashing]

486
00:41:23.813 --> 00:41:24.849
Hobnails...

487
00:41:26.149 --> 00:41:27.551
For better traction.

488
00:41:30.854 --> 00:41:32.956
[Abigail] The Widow Weldon's
son. on his rounds.

489
00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:36.059
reported that Tallie
had gotten home safely.

490
00:41:36.092 --> 00:41:38.896
with. he thought.
only a bit of frostbite.

491
00:41:38.929 --> 00:41:41.065
We haven't seen your friend
down the lane for a while.

492
00:41:42.098 --> 00:41:44.101
Finney took her to Oneonta.

493
00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:49.907
So everything is tedious
and lonesome?

494
00:41:51.207 --> 00:41:53.577
[Abigail]Thursday. April 10th.

495
00:41:54.077 --> 00:41:56.080
[light music]

496
00:41:57.814 --> 00:42:00.150
Biscuits and dried mackerel
for breakfast.

497
00:42:02.052 --> 00:42:04.721
Dyer has augmented
the padding in the cattle pens

498
00:42:04.754 --> 00:42:07.658
with his hoardings
of maple leaves and old straw.

499
00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:12.096
It always seems
that Tallie will never appear.

500
00:42:13.863 --> 00:42:16.733
But I remind myself that time
and the needle wear

501
00:42:16.766 --> 00:42:18.269
through the longest morning.

502
00:42:19.869 --> 00:42:22.206
And I have noted
that when she does arrive.

503
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.144
my heart is like a leaf
borne over a rock

504
00:42:27.177 --> 00:42:29.279
by rapidly moving water.

505
00:42:29.312 --> 00:42:31.615
[dog barking]

506
00:42:36.219 --> 00:42:38.622
[dramatic music]

507
00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.368
Hello. Oh!

508
00:42:51.401 --> 00:42:53.303
Oh! Careful.

509
00:42:53.336 --> 00:42:55.372
[laughing]

510
00:42:55.405 --> 00:42:58.075
Stay. Sit. sit.

511
00:42:59.009 --> 00:43:00.077
[chuckles]

512
00:43:03.246 --> 00:43:04.982
[dog whines]

513
00:43:05.015 --> 00:43:07.818
[Abigail]Saturday. April 12th.

514
00:43:07.851 --> 00:43:11.188
-I spent the last two days...
-Very damp. cloudy and cool.

515
00:43:12.355 --> 00:43:14.024
Smoky.

516
00:43:14.057 --> 00:43:16.727
Perhaps the forest
is somewhere on fire.

517
00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:21.865
Your nose is being gracious.

518
00:43:21.898 --> 00:43:24.935
[Abigail] Monday. April 14th.

519
00:43:24.968 --> 00:43:27.704
A terribly bad spring so far.

520
00:43:27.737 --> 00:43:30.040
but the clover
has come up through it.

521
00:43:30.073 --> 00:43:31.308
and is all right.

522
00:43:33.243 --> 00:43:34.244
And how's Finney?

523
00:43:35.412 --> 00:43:36.947
The soul of patience.

524
00:43:38.314 --> 00:43:41.185
He's mentioning again the idea
of migrating west.

525
00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.623
You're planning on moving west?

526
00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.859
Perhaps.

527
00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:53.163
I had an uncle who moved to Ohio
and came to a desperate end.

528
00:43:53.196 --> 00:43:55.699
Which is what one
might expect from Ohio.

529
00:43:57.734 --> 00:43:59.837
-Tomorrow?
-Hm.

530
00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:07.978
[Abigail]Thursday. April 17th.

531
00:44:08.011 --> 00:44:11.348
Rain in torrents
nearly all night.

532
00:44:11.381 --> 00:44:14.918
The lane is flooded
and the ditches brim full.

533
00:44:14.951 --> 00:44:17.988
This morning.
only a slight shower.

534
00:44:18.021 --> 00:44:20.891
Tallie came later
than her usual time today.

535
00:44:22.158 --> 00:44:24.061
She offered no explanation.

536
00:44:25.095 --> 00:44:27.798
[soft music]

537
00:44:47.283 --> 00:44:51.855
I'm sorry that your childhood
was anything less than joyous.

538
00:44:51.888 --> 00:44:53.223
Joyous it was not.

539
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:56.093
But I made my own happinesses.

540
00:44:59.195 --> 00:45:02.432
My husband says. "God
puts heavy stones in your path.

541
00:45:02.465 --> 00:45:04.101
it's up to us
to step over them."

542
00:45:06.836 --> 00:45:08.872
Stones are what
the fortunate receive.

543
00:45:10.173 --> 00:45:14.111
My mother's mother was born
in 1780

544
00:45:14.144 --> 00:45:15.979
right here in Schoharie County.

545
00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:20.484
I often wonder at the courage

546
00:45:20.517 --> 00:45:22.453
and the resourcefulness
of those women.

547
00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.390
Imagine faring forth
into a wilderness.

548
00:45:27.423 --> 00:45:29.960
hoping to build the foundations
of a home.

549
00:45:34.297 --> 00:45:37.201
Maybe they had a certain high
hopefulness that we don't have.

550
00:45:42.372 --> 00:45:44.041
[horse neighing in distance]

551
00:45:46.009 --> 00:45:47.044
When can you come?

552
00:45:48.244 --> 00:45:49.279
Tuesday.

553
00:45:56.085 --> 00:45:57.220
-Hello. Tallie!
-Good day.

554
00:45:57.253 --> 00:45:59.122
Was your afternoon gladsome?

555
00:45:59.155 --> 00:46:00.224
Yes. it was. very.

556
00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:05.129
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

557
00:46:10.233 --> 00:46:12.169
[Abigail] I felt.

558
00:46:12.202 --> 00:46:14.871
looking at her expression.

559
00:46:14.904 --> 00:46:18.809
as if she were
in full sail on a flood tide.

560
00:46:18.842 --> 00:46:21.278
while I bobbed
along down backwards.

561
00:46:22.145 --> 00:46:23.947
And yet.

562
00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:27.217
I never say on her countenance
the indifference

563
00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:30.287
of fortunate
towards the less fortunate.

564
00:46:31.354 --> 00:46:32.456
[sighs]

565
00:46:45.001 --> 00:46:46.203
[dog panting]

566
00:47:02.385 --> 00:47:03.387
Good day.

567
00:47:04.153 --> 00:47:05.222
Good day.

568
00:47:05.255 --> 00:47:06.256
Are you sick. too?

569
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:08.325
Not at all.

570
00:47:09.459 --> 00:47:11.128
I was hoping to compare colds.

571
00:47:12.629 --> 00:47:14.031
I'll make you tea and honey?

572
00:47:40.456 --> 00:47:41.491
What?

573
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.928
Every morning I wake up

574
00:47:44.961 --> 00:47:47.631
and I think that I never
want to be far from you.

575
00:47:58.107 --> 00:48:00.277
And under your influence.
since you're so good with words.

576
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:01.378
I've composed a poem.

577
00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.250
It's entitled...

578
00:48:07.283 --> 00:48:09.286
"Oh. Sick and Miserable Heart.
Be Still."

579
00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:18.662
When I was a little girl.

580
00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:20.664
I thought I could cultivate
my intellect

581
00:48:20.697 --> 00:48:22.966
and do something for the world.

582
00:48:25.735 --> 00:48:30.307
But my life has surprised me
by being far more ordinary.

583
00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:37.247
You're talking about that moment

584
00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:41.117
that I have dreamed about.
when we're carried in triumph

585
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:44.387
for having done something
wonderful or received at home

586
00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.991
with tears and shouts of joy.

587
00:48:48.024 --> 00:48:49.226
Do you know what I wonder?

588
00:49:00.336 --> 00:49:02.505
Is it possible...

589
00:49:02.538 --> 00:49:05.475
that such a moment hasn't
yet come for either of us?

590
00:49:08.211 --> 00:49:09.513
I think it has.

591
00:49:13.516 --> 00:49:14.651
Or that it could.

592
00:49:15.284 --> 00:49:16.286
You do.

593
00:49:18.388 --> 00:49:19.423
So what do you think?

594
00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:22.326
What do you think about us?

595
00:49:27.263 --> 00:49:29.132
I don't know how
to put it into words.

596
00:49:29.165 --> 00:49:30.167
Well. try.

597
00:49:32.402 --> 00:49:34.004
-I have tried.
-Well. try again.

598
00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:35.272
What do you imagine?

599
00:49:41.511 --> 00:49:43.179
I imagine that I love

600
00:49:43.212 --> 00:49:46.283
how our encircling feelings
leave nothing out...

601
00:49:48.284 --> 00:49:49.753
for us to want or seek.

602
00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:56.326
I've presumed too much.

603
00:50:06.569 --> 00:50:09.205
It's been my experience
that it's not always those

604
00:50:09.238 --> 00:50:13.410
who show the least
who actually feel the least.

605
00:50:19.148 --> 00:50:21.451
[scratching]

606
00:50:21.484 --> 00:50:23.320
Just my dog's toenails
on the wood.

607
00:50:44.407 --> 00:50:46.676
Why didn't you do
what you attempted to do?

608
00:50:56.853 --> 00:50:58.555
[soft gasp]

609
00:51:18.307 --> 00:51:20.410
[gentle music]

610
00:51:27.183 --> 00:51:28.685
I worry you'll catch my cold.

611
00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:33.523
You smell like a biscuit.

612
00:51:33.556 --> 00:51:35.225
[soft laugh]

613
00:51:41.297 --> 00:51:42.666
I have to go home.

614
00:52:02.618 --> 00:52:04.588
[Abigail]Astonishment and joy.

615
00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:14.798
Astonishment and joy.

616
00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:26.276
[sighs deeply]

617
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:28.578
Astonishment and joy.

618
00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.184
[breathing deeply]

619
00:52:35.451 --> 00:52:37.454
[bright music]

620
00:52:49.932 --> 00:52:51.368
-[lock clinking]
-[door opens]

621
00:52:53.002 --> 00:52:55.472
You haven't accomplished
any of your responsibilities.

622
00:52:57.907 --> 00:53:00.911
-Do you need assistance?
-No. I don't think so.

623
00:53:14.957 --> 00:53:16.927
So it's a cold plate
for supper tonight?

624
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:28.838
I'll milk the cows.

625
00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:42.586
[tranquil music]

626
00:54:06.842 --> 00:54:08.645
[Abigail] Friday. May 30th.

627
00:54:11.314 --> 00:54:13.449
The sunshine streaming
through the branches

628
00:54:13.482 --> 00:54:16.820
makes a tremendous farrago
of light and shade.

629
00:54:23.526 --> 00:54:27.430
We hold our friendship
between us and study it.

630
00:54:28.998 --> 00:54:32.502
as if it were the incomplete
map of our escape.

631
00:54:41.977 --> 00:54:43.513
When the day is done.

632
00:54:44.647 --> 00:54:46.082
my mind turns to her.

633
00:54:46.115 --> 00:54:48.451
and I think.
with a special heat.

634
00:54:50.519 --> 00:54:52.689
"Why are we to be separated?"

635
00:54:55.524 --> 00:54:57.727
[approaching footsteps]

636
00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:17.780
Your smile stopped.
Is it meant for someone else?

637
00:55:17.813 --> 00:55:19.516
Sorry. my mind was elsewhere.

638
00:55:25.054 --> 00:55:27.424
We need calico and buttons
and shoe thread.

639
00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:35.065
Am I troubling you.
sitting here with you like this?

640
00:55:36.732 --> 00:55:37.767
Not at all.

641
00:55:43.773 --> 00:55:44.907
I may be late coming to it.

642
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.976
but I've learned
consideration of others.

643
00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:51.881
I've learned the need
for human sympathy

644
00:55:53.649 --> 00:55:55.018
and the unfulfilled want of it.

645
00:55:56.986 --> 00:55:58.922
I feel I've provided you
with sympathy.

646
00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:03.393
I suppose that's so.

647
00:56:12.067 --> 00:56:13.536
[sighs sharply]

648
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:15.905
[knocks on door]

649
00:56:19.875 --> 00:56:21.010
The smile returns.

650
00:56:29.185 --> 00:56:30.487
[Tallie] Good day.

651
00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:35.024
[door slamming]

652
00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:41.831
[gasps]

653
00:56:43.866 --> 00:56:48.137
[rapid breathing]
Oh.

654
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:50.440
I believe that intimacy
increases goodwill.

655
00:56:51.173 --> 00:56:53.443
And if that's the case.

656
00:56:53.476 --> 00:56:54.811
then every minute
we spend together

657
00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:56.746
will make us
more cheerful workers.

658
00:56:59.515 --> 00:57:01.084
Won't our farms benefit
from that?

659
00:57:02.551 --> 00:57:03.620
Won't our husbands?

660
00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:08.691
All our burdens
will be lightened.

661
00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:27.444
[humming]

662
00:57:35.084 --> 00:57:38.855
[Abigail] When she left.
I was like a skiff at sea

663
00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:41.858
with neither hand nor helm
to guide it.

664
00:57:44.693 --> 00:57:47.096
They're cleaning out the drain
under the street along the fork.

665
00:57:50.566 --> 00:57:52.569
And several people
are down with fever.

666
00:57:58.274 --> 00:58:01.143
Holt came by to hang the bacon.

667
00:58:01.176 --> 00:58:03.913
He still hasn't recovered from
being beaten by two strangers.

668
00:58:05.247 --> 00:58:08.618
He had to be hauled to his home
in his cart.

669
00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:10.553
He said the men who did it
were gonna kill him.

670
00:58:10.586 --> 00:58:12.989
and then realized they were
mistaken as to who he was.

671
00:58:13.022 --> 00:58:14.657
Lately. it seems like
all you talk about

672
00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:16.159
are highwaymen
and house breakers.

673
00:58:20.095 --> 00:58:22.131
[breathes deeply]

674
00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:25.268
On the contrary.

675
00:58:25.301 --> 00:58:27.203
I often defer
to your sensitivities.

676
00:58:29.271 --> 00:58:30.740
And I haven't even
told you about

677
00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:32.308
all the reports
in the county of men

678
00:58:32.341 --> 00:58:34.944
who've poisoned
and killed their wives

679
00:58:34.977 --> 00:58:37.113
because I haven't found it
a fitting subject for supper.

680
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:43.052
[Abigail] "Killed their wives."
he used those words?

681
00:58:43.085 --> 00:58:44.621
[Tallie] Mm-hm. those words.

682
00:58:46.088 --> 00:58:48.658
Have you had any disagreements?

683
00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:50.993
Yes. about my wifely duties.

684
00:58:51.026 --> 00:58:53.530
I told him that I was opposed
to it. that I was not willing.

685
00:58:56.265 --> 00:58:57.634
And he accepted that?

686
00:58:59.034 --> 00:59:00.937
Well. he hasn't
touched me since. so...

687
00:59:06.909 --> 00:59:07.977
[branch snapping]

688
00:59:12.948 --> 00:59:14.617
But I made myself
feel better...

689
00:59:15.951 --> 00:59:17.220
by composing a poem.

690
00:59:18.921 --> 00:59:20.323
Can I read
you the opening stanza?

691
00:59:21.857 --> 00:59:23.359
You can read me the entire poem.

692
00:59:23.392 --> 00:59:25.328
No. I'll start with
the opening stanza.

693
00:59:31.967 --> 00:59:33.736
"I love flowering gardens.

694
00:59:34.336 --> 00:59:36.639
I love creeping plants.

695
00:59:36.672 --> 00:59:38.841
I love walking in the air.

696
00:59:38.874 --> 00:59:40.643
but I fear swarming ants."

697
00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:47.817
I don't think I can
support the rhyme.

698
00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:50.887
[laughing]

699
00:59:52.921 --> 00:59:54.724
You see why I didn't
read the whole thing?

700
00:59:55.791 --> 00:59:57.193
I'm sorry.

701
00:59:57.226 --> 00:59:59.662
I've always been contrary
and maladroit.

702
01:00:05.934 --> 01:00:07.770
Earlier. I... I felt that...

703
01:00:10.005 --> 01:00:13.909
whenever I would draw close
to you. you would retreat.

704
01:00:13.942 --> 01:00:16.312
and that. if I kept still.
you would return

705
01:00:16.345 --> 01:00:19.248
but you'd stay at a distance.
like those sparrows

706
01:00:19.281 --> 01:00:22.251
that stay in the farmyard
and won't come into the house.

707
01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:26.822
-That's not how I feel.
-How do you feel. then?

708
01:00:26.855 --> 01:00:28.758
When I was in school.

709
01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.426
the teacher had me
read "Cordelia"

710
01:00:30.459 --> 01:00:32.028
to an older boy's "King Lear."

711
01:00:33.462 --> 01:00:34.363
Near the end of the play.

712
01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:37.400
the king and his daughter
are imprisoned.

713
01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:39.636
but he views it
in a positive way.

714
01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:43.940
"Come. let's away to prison."
he says.

715
01:00:45.874 --> 01:00:49.278
"We two alone shall sing
like birds in a cage."

716
01:00:50.379 --> 01:00:51.414
Imprisoned...

717
01:00:54.016 --> 01:00:55.318
In a positive way?

718
01:00:56.785 --> 01:01:00.289
Well. maybe that one has to read
the entire play.

719
01:01:00.322 --> 01:01:02.324
It may be only in plays
where people

720
01:01:02.357 --> 01:01:05.294
are imprisoned
in a positive way.

721
01:01:05.327 --> 01:01:07.964
You don't think there's a cage
that could work to our benefit?

722
01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:15.204
I just...

723
01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:21.044
I only know that...

724
01:01:24.012 --> 01:01:25.448
I've never liked cages.

725
01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:42.965
[wood creaking]

726
01:01:45.267 --> 01:01:48.771
I hope you had a good afternoon
in Shangri-La or Timbuktu.

727
01:01:48.804 --> 01:01:49.972
wherever it is you've been.

728
01:01:50.005 --> 01:01:51.874
I had a busy afternoon. yes.

729
01:01:51.907 --> 01:01:53.175
I would think.

730
01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:55.211
Five hours you've been gone.

731
01:01:55.244 --> 01:01:56.378
I went to the drapers.

732
01:01:56.411 --> 01:01:58.848
I couldn't find anything
I liked.

733
01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.783
Then I stopped by the tinker
for a sack of coffee.

734
01:02:00.816 --> 01:02:03.419
but he's now asking 60 cents.
and I only had 50.

735
01:02:03.452 --> 01:02:05.387
Then I thought I would buy you
a treat of some kind.

736
01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.123
but Mr. Arnolds reminded me

737
01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:09.025
that I still owed
for my last transactions so...

738
01:02:10.926 --> 01:02:12.795
[sighs] I was forced
to close up my purse.

739
01:02:14.096 --> 01:02:15.297
[chuckles]

740
01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:17.133
Tell me everything
about your day.

741
01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:18.267
Don't hold anything back.

742
01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:21.370
You're not interested in
how your wife spends her time.

743
01:02:21.403 --> 01:02:23.372
I don't feel I have a wife.

744
01:02:23.405 --> 01:02:26.308
I feel I have a selfish whore
who...

745
01:02:26.341 --> 01:02:28.811
who'd rather wander off
to another man's house

746
01:02:28.844 --> 01:02:30.246
than contribute any labor.

747
01:02:35.117 --> 01:02:36.952
Well. Dyer was off
in the fields.

748
01:02:36.985 --> 01:02:39.155
and her house
is on the way back home. so...

749
01:02:41.223 --> 01:02:42.792
So it's just Abigail and you

750
01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:45.261
tittering and gossiping
away the hours?

751
01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:48.397
Enjoying each other's company.

752
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:51.867
I have certain expectations.
and you have certain duties.

753
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.837
We've talked all night and day
about your expectations.

754
01:02:57.239 --> 01:02:58.574
I will not stay with a woman

755
01:02:58.607 --> 01:03:00.876
if it continually requires
contention.

756
01:03:00.909 --> 01:03:03.345
Well. then you shouldn't stay
with me. should you?

757
01:03:03.378 --> 01:03:05.114
Don't ask for more
than you can handle.

758
01:03:13.889 --> 01:03:17.326
[Abigail] Sunday. June 8th.

759
01:03:17.359 --> 01:03:20.930
All afternoon. a hawk has been
using a single cloud above us

760
01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.832
-as its own parasol.
-[gunshot]

761
01:03:38.914 --> 01:03:41.083
To ward off others of its kind.

762
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:59.402
[Abigail] Our whole house now
seems both angry and repentant.

763
01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:04.273
God help us.

764
01:04:10.579 --> 01:04:12.615
[owl hooting]

765
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.204
When three days went by
without a word from her.

766
01:04:35.237 --> 01:04:38.340
I stole over to her house
to look on her

767
01:04:38.373 --> 01:04:40.109
from what I imagined to be

768
01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:42.211
a vantage point
of perfect safety.

769
01:04:50.619 --> 01:04:54.323
By turning the lens piece.
I could draw her face nearer.

770
01:04:54.356 --> 01:04:57.960
and hold it there
until she turned away.

771
01:04:57.993 --> 01:05:00.496
Her image provoked
a sensation in me

772
01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:03.132
like the violence
that sends a floating branch

773
01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:06.168
far out over
a waterfall's precipice

774
01:05:06.201 --> 01:05:08.137
-before it plummets.
-[glass shattering]

775
01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.571
-[door opens]
-[barking]

776
01:05:09.604 --> 01:05:10.606
[cocks gun]

777
01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:19.148
[panting]

778
01:05:22.017 --> 01:05:25.154
"For the wife does not have
the authority over her own body.

779
01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:26.221
but the husband does.

780
01:05:26.254 --> 01:05:27.656
Do not deprive one another.

781
01:05:27.689 --> 01:05:29.491
so that Satan may not tempt you

782
01:05:29.524 --> 01:05:31.694
because of your lack
of self-control."

783
01:05:31.727 --> 01:05:35.331
Ephesians 5:33. "Submit to your
own husbands. as to the Lord..."

784
01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:37.433
[Abigail] Monday. June 9th.

785
01:05:37.466 --> 01:05:40.036
[thunder rumbling]

786
01:05:53.615 --> 01:05:55.051
Merciful father...

787
01:05:56.618 --> 01:05:59.055
Turn the channel of events.

788
01:06:12.534 --> 01:06:15.504
Wednesday. June 11th.

789
01:06:19.741 --> 01:06:23.012
Dyer has been silent all day.

790
01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:25.514
and I was happy to be left
in my solitude.

791
01:06:39.728 --> 01:06:40.763
Hello!

792
01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:43.699
Tallie...

793
01:06:43.732 --> 01:06:45.234
We haven't seen you for days.

794
01:06:47.135 --> 01:06:48.170
Have you been ill?

795
01:06:50.105 --> 01:06:51.507
-Nothing serious. I hope.
-[Finney] Ho!

796
01:06:54.342 --> 01:06:55.411
She's been under the weather.

797
01:06:57.279 --> 01:07:00.215
-[Dyer] Good afternoon.
-[Tallie] Good afternoon.

798
01:07:00.248 --> 01:07:03.385
We want to invite you to dinner
again this Saturday next.

799
01:07:03.418 --> 01:07:06.355
But it's our turn.
We should be feasting you.

800
01:07:06.388 --> 01:07:08.290
In the meantime.
please be our guests.

801
01:07:09.758 --> 01:07:10.760
[Dyer] We'd love to.

802
01:07:11.426 --> 01:07:12.461
Six?

803
01:07:13.495 --> 01:07:15.097
-[Dyer] Six it is.
-Hup!

804
01:07:23.805 --> 01:07:25.808
[ominous music]

805
01:07:33.181 --> 01:07:34.817
[Abigail]My mother once told me
in a fury

806
01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:36.752
when I was a little girl

807
01:07:36.785 --> 01:07:38.687
that my father
asked nothing of her

808
01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.856
except that
she work in the garden.

809
01:07:40.889 --> 01:07:43.625
harvest the produce.
preserve the fruit.

810
01:07:43.658 --> 01:07:46.328
tend the poultry.
milk the cows.

811
01:07:46.361 --> 01:07:48.163
manage the household duties.

812
01:07:48.196 --> 01:07:50.766
and help out in the fields
when needed.

813
01:07:50.799 --> 01:07:52.601
She said she appeared
in his ledger

814
01:07:52.634 --> 01:07:55.071
only when she purchased a dress.

815
01:07:56.471 --> 01:07:57.807
Am I anywhere in there?

816
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:04.179
I'm recording spring expenses.

817
01:08:04.212 --> 01:08:06.415
[Abigail] And how have
things changed?

818
01:08:06.448 --> 01:08:08.383
Daughters are married off
so young

819
01:08:08.416 --> 01:08:11.720
that everywhere you look
a slender and unwilling girl

820
01:08:11.753 --> 01:08:14.656
is being forced to stem
a sea of tribulations

821
01:08:14.689 --> 01:08:17.293
before she is even full-grown
in height.

822
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:22.398
That's its purpose!

823
01:08:28.336 --> 01:08:32.475
[indistinct chatter]

824
01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:42.585
Come on. Come on.

825
01:08:50.525 --> 01:08:51.627
Morning.

826
01:09:08.843 --> 01:09:09.912
Morning. Jim.

827
01:09:10.745 --> 01:09:12.414
Morning. ma'am.

828
01:09:12.447 --> 01:09:13.649
I've got a new book for you.

829
01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:15.217
Do you know.
I'd actually like to see

830
01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:16.885
that blue dress you have there.

831
01:09:16.918 --> 01:09:18.187
All right. lady.

832
01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:23.859
[woman 1] Over here!

833
01:09:34.636 --> 01:09:35.804
It's two and a half.

834
01:09:37.806 --> 01:09:38.874
I'll take it.

835
01:09:46.314 --> 01:09:47.917
[baby crying]

836
01:09:54.923 --> 01:09:56.858
[baby crying]

837
01:09:56.891 --> 01:09:58.861
[shushing]

838
01:09:59.494 --> 01:10:00.696
[humming]

839
01:10:10.605 --> 01:10:11.707
My change?

840
01:10:17.345 --> 01:10:18.380
Thank you.

841
01:10:20.315 --> 01:10:22.851
[Abigail]The Mannings' oldest
daughter tipped over an oil lamp

842
01:10:22.884 --> 01:10:24.653
and it set the house ablaze.

843
01:10:24.686 --> 01:10:26.388
-[woman 2] Fire!
-[Abigail] Ho! Ho!

844
01:10:27.989 --> 01:10:29.391
-[man 4] Fire!
-Before she was driven

845
01:10:29.424 --> 01:10:31.660
from the house by the flames.

846
01:10:31.693 --> 01:10:33.762
she heard calls from her sister.

847
01:10:33.795 --> 01:10:35.798
who was trapped
in the upper loft.

848
01:10:36.665 --> 01:10:38.667
[foreboding music]

849
01:10:40.602 --> 01:10:43.372
[indistinct shouting]

850
01:10:46.474 --> 01:10:48.410
[Mrs. Manning cries]

851
01:10:48.443 --> 01:10:49.979
Get her out of there.

852
01:10:55.617 --> 01:10:57.552
Cassie!

853
01:10:57.585 --> 01:10:59.688
[indistinct chatter]

854
01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:09.531
Get her out!

855
01:11:14.102 --> 01:11:15.437
Get her out!

856
01:11:20.408 --> 01:11:23.879
[crying]

857
01:11:37.959 --> 01:11:41.463
Your wife is to be commended
on her hospitality and cooking.

858
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.803
I can recall the day...

859
01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:50.372
No. thank you.

860
01:11:50.405 --> 01:11:55.544
...when every family was fed.
clothed. shot. sheltered.

861
01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:57.779
and warmed from the products
a good wife

862
01:11:57.812 --> 01:11:59.715
gathered within
her own fence line.

863
01:12:02.016 --> 01:12:04.619
I heard down by the loggers
that Mrs. Mannings' oldest

864
01:12:04.652 --> 01:12:07.122
got fiercely burned
in the house fire.

865
01:12:07.155 --> 01:12:09.024
-Cassie.
-[Tallie] And died.

866
01:12:10.425 --> 01:12:12.328
[Abigail] Yes. she did.

867
01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:15.831
Well. as my father used to say.

868
01:12:17.065 --> 01:12:18.934
"The supreme disposer
of all events

869
01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:21.570
does sometimes disappoint
our earthly hopes."

870
01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:29.044
What a marvelous hanging lamp.

871
01:12:29.077 --> 01:12:31.046
Finney purchased it so
that everyone could read

872
01:12:31.079 --> 01:12:33.048
with equal ease around the room.

873
01:12:33.081 --> 01:12:34.917
I wasn't brought up to read
over much.

874
01:12:36.885 --> 01:12:39.087
but I do believe a father
should give his children

875
01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.623
every chance to improve.

876
01:12:41.656 --> 01:12:43.726
Children being a sore point
in this household.

877
01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:47.796
And yours. I'd expect.

878
01:12:51.733 --> 01:12:53.068
You'll have to forgive
my husband.

879
01:12:57.839 --> 01:13:00.008
Even so.

880
01:13:00.041 --> 01:13:02.110
whatever misfortunes
arrive at my doorstep.

881
01:13:02.143 --> 01:13:04.847
I seek to improve my lot
with my own industry.

882
01:13:06.514 --> 01:13:07.583
I...

883
01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:10.952
I study my options closely.

884
01:13:10.985 --> 01:13:13.989
and just attend to everything
with more vehemence.

885
01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:16.558
Well. then you should be
commended for that.

886
01:13:16.591 --> 01:13:18.059
I'll give you an example.

887
01:13:18.092 --> 01:13:21.062
When I first began farming.

888
01:13:21.095 --> 01:13:23.098
I was so vexed
at my own inability

889
01:13:23.131 --> 01:13:25.434
to stop my dogs barking

890
01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:27.836
that one January.
during a storm.

891
01:13:27.869 --> 01:13:31.039
I held the dog around
the corner of the barn in a gale

892
01:13:31.072 --> 01:13:32.474
until it froze to death.

893
01:13:35.977 --> 01:13:40.015
I nearly froze to death myself.
at least froze my hands.

894
01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:41.850
even with my heavy work gloves.

895
01:13:41.883 --> 01:13:43.419
That is reprehensible.

896
01:13:46.154 --> 01:13:48.890
[Dyer] Did I see outside
that you use an old shovel plow?

897
01:13:48.923 --> 01:13:51.827
Well. since you're interested
in my machinery.

898
01:13:53.628 --> 01:13:56.731
I have a hinged harrow
that's been giving me trouble.

899
01:13:56.764 --> 01:14:00.068
The spikes catch the rocks
and roots. and they break off.

900
01:14:00.101 --> 01:14:02.871
Well. our harrow
has upright discs.

901
01:14:02.904 --> 01:14:04.006
Work better?

902
01:14:05.006 --> 01:14:06.041
Yeah. it seems to.

903
01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:11.046
Bring the desserts.

904
01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:13.081
I think we're stuffed.

905
01:14:13.114 --> 01:14:14.816
My husband insists
on his pastries

906
01:14:14.849 --> 01:14:16.452
and preserved fruits and creams.

907
01:14:17.285 --> 01:14:18.520
Well. good.

908
01:14:20.555 --> 01:14:21.824
[plates clattering]

909
01:14:26.761 --> 01:14:27.863
What is happening?

910
01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:29.564
Are you in danger?

911
01:14:29.597 --> 01:14:31.266
What happened to your neck?

912
01:14:31.299 --> 01:14:33.502
No. I just took a fall
over a fence.

913
01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:36.171
I hadn't heard.

914
01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:39.842
There are many things about
which you haven't heard.

915
01:14:47.949 --> 01:14:49.017
[Abigail] Back at the table.

916
01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:51.487
Tallie kept strict custody
of her eyes.

917
01:14:52.954 --> 01:14:55.991
Her husband's mood
seemed to have darkened.

918
01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:58.827
He served the pastries
and creams himself.

919
01:15:00.862 --> 01:15:02.731
leaving only her plate empty.

920
01:15:19.047 --> 01:15:21.583
Saturday. June 21st.

921
01:15:23.117 --> 01:15:24.720
My heart a maelstrom.

922
01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:28.123
My head a bedlam.

923
01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:30.726
A whole week
and no visit from Tallie.

924
01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:33.629
No word.

925
01:15:42.937 --> 01:15:45.874
My anxieties often force me
to stop my work

926
01:15:45.907 --> 01:15:48.010
and pace the house
like an inmate.

927
01:15:49.744 --> 01:15:50.913
I have to see her.

928
01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:54.550
[suspenseful music]

929
01:16:10.264 --> 01:16:11.567
Ho. ho!

930
01:16:18.706 --> 01:16:20.943
[horse breathing heavy]

931
01:16:29.817 --> 01:16:31.853
Tallie! Tallie!

932
01:16:38.259 --> 01:16:39.294
[gasps]

933
01:17:10.224 --> 01:17:12.227
[ominous music]

934
01:17:20.968 --> 01:17:22.070
-[thud]
-[gasps]

935
01:17:23.905 --> 01:17:24.973
What has happened?

936
01:17:25.973 --> 01:17:27.042
They're gone.

937
01:17:29.477 --> 01:17:31.279
And no goodbye?

938
01:17:31.312 --> 01:17:32.814
We need to call the sheriff.

939
01:17:38.252 --> 01:17:41.690
And report what exactly?
That our neighbors moved?

940
01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:43.858
It's the Zebrun farm.
They were renting.

941
01:17:43.891 --> 01:17:44.893
I'll go then.

942
01:17:45.426 --> 01:17:47.028
For what reason?

943
01:17:47.061 --> 01:17:48.130
There's blood!

944
01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:52.834
And you never had an accident?

945
01:18:00.408 --> 01:18:01.977
So we'll just do nothing?

946
01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.063
I'll make the rounds
of the neighbors.

947
01:18:23.164 --> 01:18:24.766
And if we are not satisfied.

948
01:18:24.799 --> 01:18:26.168
we can take your fears
to the sheriff.

949
01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:30.338
Thank you.

950
01:18:34.976 --> 01:18:38.012
[Abigail] Monday. June 23rd.

951
01:18:38.045 --> 01:18:40.982
Dyer said Mrs. Nottoway
recalled spotting their caravan

952
01:18:41.015 --> 01:18:44.786
on the country road in the
late evening. heading northwest.

953
01:18:44.819 --> 01:18:45.854
[Dyer] Mrs. Nottoway?

954
01:18:45.887 --> 01:18:47.922
She believed she spied
Tallie's figure

955
01:18:47.955 --> 01:18:51.025
alongside her husband's
but was unsure.

956
01:18:51.058 --> 01:18:55.864
A hired hand. she thought.
was driving the second wagon.

957
01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:58.133
Sunday. June 29th

958
01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:00.902
I spotted the sheriff
on his way to church.

959
01:19:00.935 --> 01:19:04.139
I conveyed my accusations.
to no response.

960
01:19:06.974 --> 01:19:09.310
Dyer said that no one would
investigate a crime

961
01:19:09.343 --> 01:19:11.446
without evidence that a crime
had been committed.

962
01:19:11.479 --> 01:19:12.514
Calm myself?

963
01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:14.382
I refused to calm myself.

964
01:19:14.415 --> 01:19:17.986
so he tied me to a chair
and administered laudanum.

965
01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:20.989
Monday. June 30th.

966
01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:23.892
Bleary and short of breath
from the laudanum...

967
01:19:27.595 --> 01:19:29.030
I wake weeping.

968
01:19:29.964 --> 01:19:31.166
retire weeping.

969
01:19:32.266 --> 01:19:34.770
stand before my duties weeping.

970
01:19:37.371 --> 01:19:39.407
[ominous music]

971
01:19:40.241 --> 01:19:42.977
Sunday. July 6th.

972
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:46.114
I am a library without books.

973
01:19:46.147 --> 01:19:50.285
a sea of fear.
agitation and want.

974
01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:54.255
Dyer speaks of how much we
have for which to be grateful.

975
01:19:54.288 --> 01:19:57.325
I sit violently conscious
of the ticking clock

976
01:19:57.358 --> 01:19:59.394
while he weeps
at what he imagines

977
01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:02.430
to be his own poor.
forgotten self.

978
01:20:02.463 --> 01:20:04.299
Wednesday. July 9th.

979
01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.203
Despite some hours
without the laudanum.

980
01:20:08.236 --> 01:20:10.839
I was so befogged
and wild with grief

981
01:20:10.872 --> 01:20:12.808
that Dyer left me
for the afternoon.

982
01:20:13.574 --> 01:20:16.077
unsettled and wary of my state.

983
01:20:20.915 --> 01:20:23.218
Tuesday. July 22nd.

984
01:20:32.426 --> 01:20:33.929
[horse neighing]

985
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:37.833
[galloping]

986
01:20:39.267 --> 01:20:41.402
-Weldon?
-Good day.

987
01:20:41.435 --> 01:20:42.904
The renters at Zebrun's farm
are gone.

988
01:20:42.937 --> 01:20:44.372
Did they leave
a forwarding address?

989
01:20:45.573 --> 01:20:47.943
No. You've got a letter.

990
01:20:50.511 --> 01:20:51.580
Hyah.

991
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:57.586
Is it from her?

992
01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:01.189
It is.

993
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:04.893
-Oh.
-Origin?

994
01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:06.428
Onondaga County. Do you know it?

995
01:21:09.063 --> 01:21:10.398
It's north of Syracuse.

996
01:21:19.273 --> 01:21:20.375
Are you gonna read it?

997
01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:23.979
To myself.

998
01:21:38.559 --> 01:21:42.397
[Tallie]
Abigail. Abigail. Abigail.

999
01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:45.934
I'm sorry that all I have
to send you is this letter.

1000
01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:49.604
and I'm sorry for all
that a letter cannot be.

1001
01:21:51.272 --> 01:21:53.909
Even the best letter
is just a little bit of someone.

1002
01:21:55.643 --> 01:21:58.146
I'm sorry I never got
to say goodbye.

1003
01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.116
and I'm sorry that we seem
to have traded

1004
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:03.985
one sort of misery for another.

1005
01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.690
It turns out that houses deep
in the backwoods

1006
01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:12.661
always seem to be awful and
unnatural in their loneliness.

1007
01:22:14.328 --> 01:22:15.663
If there were only
a ruined abbey

1008
01:22:15.696 --> 01:22:18.967
around here with bats in it.
the view would be perfect.

1009
01:22:21.235 --> 01:22:25.239
Our roof is ramshackle and sheds
water nicely in dry weather

1010
01:22:25.272 --> 01:22:29.744
but we have to spread milk pans
around the floor when it rains.

1011
01:22:29.777 --> 01:22:31.713
Still. outside the kitchen.

1012
01:22:31.746 --> 01:22:36.184
there are already anemones
and heart's-ease.

1013
01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:38.686
and even prettier flowers
which my stupidity

1014
01:22:38.719 --> 01:22:42.090
keeps me from naming for you.

1015
01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:46.027
I believe I've enjoyed myself
less these last few weeks

1016
01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:48.396
than any other female
who ever lived.

1017
01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:52.500
During what little time
I have to myself.

1018
01:22:52.533 --> 01:22:55.136
Finney reads aloud
instructions for wives

1019
01:22:55.169 --> 01:22:56.671
from the Old Testament.

1020
01:22:59.373 --> 01:23:01.109
But when it comes to the Bible.

1021
01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:03.444
I have to say that
there are a lot of passages

1022
01:23:03.477 --> 01:23:05.513
he may know word for word.

1023
01:23:05.546 --> 01:23:07.315
but which haven't touched
his heart.

1024
01:23:09.216 --> 01:23:11.419
I can't account for his state
of mind except to say

1025
01:23:11.452 --> 01:23:15.023
that my company must be
intensely disagreeable to him.

1026
01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:17.292
And if that's the case.

1027
01:23:18.125 --> 01:23:19.260
I'm sorry for it.

1028
01:23:25.666 --> 01:23:28.136
[horse approaching]

1029
01:23:31.472 --> 01:23:32.507
Ho...

1030
01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:35.243
[mailman] Good afternoon!

1031
01:23:38.112 --> 01:23:39.381
[Finney] Afternoon.

1032
01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:42.650
Whoa.

1033
01:23:42.683 --> 01:23:43.718
Hey.

1034
01:23:45.352 --> 01:23:46.554
I've got something for you.

1035
01:23:48.722 --> 01:23:49.758
There you go.

1036
01:23:50.491 --> 01:23:51.592
Thank you.

1037
01:23:51.625 --> 01:23:52.660
Good day.

1038
01:23:53.394 --> 01:23:54.763
Hyah. Come on.

1039
01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:08.777
-Is it for me?
-From Schoharie County.

1040
01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.549
-Your Abigail.
-Give that to me.

1041
01:24:14.582 --> 01:24:16.351
Give it. Finney. give...

1042
01:24:18.652 --> 01:24:19.653
Finney!

1043
01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:22.490
"What's to become
of the thousands of our sex

01:24:24.291 --> 01:24:27.095
and obliged
to tax our strengths?

1046
01:24:27.128 --> 01:24:28.729
I feel as if.
at that selfsame hour

1047
01:24:28.762 --> 01:24:29.797
when our prospects
were brightest.

1048
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:32.534
that in the dim distance
a black shadow approached.

1049
01:24:33.467 --> 01:24:35.369
And yet still.

1050
01:24:35.402 --> 01:24:37.705
imagine the happiest of unions
for us of the sort

1051
01:24:37.738 --> 01:24:39.674
in which two families previously
at daggers drawn

1052
01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:42.343
are miraculously brought
together on love's account.

1053
01:24:47.848 --> 01:24:49.617
It is your face
I bear through the night.

1054
01:24:49.650 --> 01:24:51.752
It is to you I devote
a dreaming space

1055
01:24:51.785 --> 01:24:55.123
before I turn myself to sleep.
but there is no sleep.

1056
01:24:55.156 --> 01:24:58.593
It's as if within me everything
clamors for air.

1057
01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:00.728
and I think
if it's like this now.

1058
01:25:00.761 --> 01:25:01.863
what will it be like later?

1059
01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:06.501
I send you what love
and support I can.

1060
01:25:08.202 --> 01:25:10.238
I send you all my heart's hopes.

[Tallie] Please know
that force alone

1063
01:25:37.364 --> 01:25:40.735
couldn't have gotten me here
to a place like this.

1064
01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:44.872
I was told I had to act
in support of interest.

1065
01:25:44.905 --> 01:25:49.911
happiness and the reputation
of someone I once loved.

1066
01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:53.915
As far as I can figure.

1067
01:25:53.948 --> 01:25:56.918
we're now still only about
85 miles apart.

1068
01:25:58.419 --> 01:26:00.454
But of course.

1069
01:26:00.487 --> 01:26:02.857
people like us
don't go on long visits.

[ominous music]

1071
01:26:39.293 --> 01:26:42.463
[Abigail] Dyer refused first
to permit my departure.

and then to accompany me.

1073
01:26:46.333 --> 01:26:47.534
and only caught up to the cart

1074
01:26:47.568 --> 01:26:50.304
at the end of our property
and climbed aboard.

1076
01:26:53.974 --> 01:26:56.877
We were the very picture
of anguish.

1077
01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:59.214
rattling along side by side.

1078
01:27:00.914 --> 01:27:05.653
The night was fair and warm with
the appearance of a coming rain.

1079
01:27:05.686 --> 01:27:06.754
A shower.

[horse whinnies]

1082
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:50.631
[Tallie] It's so hard
to write about

1083
01:27:50.664 --> 01:27:52.733
how much I want to thank you.

1084
01:27:52.766 --> 01:27:55.436
but I have to start somewhere.

1085
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:58.939
Abigail...

1086
01:27:58.972 --> 01:28:04.078
I want to tell you that being
with you. even alone.

1087
01:28:04.111 --> 01:28:07.682
has been like being a part
of the biggest

1088
01:28:07.715 --> 01:28:12.920
and most spacious community
I could ever imagine.

1089
01:28:12.953 --> 01:28:17.024
I feel closer to you
than I would a sister since

1090
01:28:17.057 --> 01:28:19.394
everything amazing that I feel.

1091
01:28:20.594 --> 01:28:22.830
I chose to feel.

1092
01:28:25.599 --> 01:28:28.036
And do you know what memory
it is that I most cherish?

1093
01:28:30.437 --> 01:28:34.442
It's of you turning to me
with that smile you gave me

1094
01:28:35.843 --> 01:28:39.514
once you realized
that you were loved.

1095
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:45.986
I have no way of knowing
what is to come.

1096
01:28:46.019 --> 01:28:49.590
but I do know
that all of the trust

1097
01:28:49.623 --> 01:28:52.660
and care and courage we shared.

1098
01:28:53.894 --> 01:28:55.663
that will all shine on us

1099
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:58.433
and protect us.

1100
01:29:00.467 --> 01:29:03.738
You are my city of joy.

1101
01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:07.809
You are my city of joy.

[dramatic music]

[Dyer] Whoa.

1104
01:29:48.182 --> 01:29:49.683
[Finney] Might I ask
your business?

1105
01:29:49.716 --> 01:29:52.486
We've come to see Tallie.
Where is she?

1106
01:29:52.519 --> 01:29:54.789
I heard you on the road.

1107
01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:56.957
You made such a racket.
I took you for the tin knocker.

1108
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:57.858
We've ridden for three days.

1109
01:29:57.891 --> 01:29:59.126
We are not leaving
without seeing her.

1110
01:29:59.159 --> 01:30:02.196
I'm not concerned with what you
will or will not leave without.

1111
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:03.631
[Dyer] Keep a civil tongue.
friend.

1112
01:30:03.664 --> 01:30:05.533
Where is she?

1113
01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:06.834
I treated her with tea of soot

1114
01:30:06.867 --> 01:30:09.503
and pine-tree root
to good effect.

1115
01:30:09.536 --> 01:30:10.871
but sickness always tests
our willingness

1116
01:30:10.904 --> 01:30:12.774
to bow before
the greatest authority.

1117
01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:15.976
My guess is
that it was diphtheria.

1118
01:30:16.009 --> 01:30:17.011
No!

1119
01:30:18.679 --> 01:30:20.514

Weather very hot and sunny.

1138
01:33:14.321 --> 01:33:16.256
I cleaned out the shed

1139
01:33:16.289 --> 01:33:18.793
which was full of rusty
and dusty rubbish.

1140
01:33:19.726 --> 01:33:21.929
washed the windows.

1141
01:33:21.962 --> 01:33:23.898
and preserved apples
for the winter.

1142
01:33:26.933 --> 01:33:29.937
Fourteen dollars from the sale
of our milk and butter.

1143
01:33:32.272 --> 01:33:34.675
I have cut my hand
with a paring knife.

1144
01:33:38.078 --> 01:33:40.848
I console myself
with the conviction

1145
01:33:40.881 --> 01:33:42.983
that someday in the future
when Dyer

1146
01:33:43.016 --> 01:33:46.654
is forced to travel to Syracuse
for feed or supplies.

1147
01:33:47.921 --> 01:33:49.790
I will join him.

1148
01:33:49.823 --> 01:33:52.860
and take his rifle
and go to Skaneateles

1149
01:33:52.893 --> 01:33:55.029
and kill Finney where he sits.

1150
01:34:02.202 --> 01:34:04.171
Dyer has been at work
on the barn.

Sometimes after it gets dark.

1153

across our upper fields

01:34:24.024 --> 01:34:25.693
for the wide. wide view.

1155
01:34:28.228 --> 01:34:30.965
And Dyer tries to imagine us
as we were.

1156
01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:35.469
while I try to imagine Tallie

1157
01:34:35.502 --> 01:34:37.971
and that cordial
and accepting home

1158
01:34:38.004 --> 01:34:40.107
that existed solely
in our dreams.

1159
01:34:41.842 --> 01:34:44.978
I imagine Tallie and Nellie
somewhere together.

and Nellie running her brush
through Tallie's hair.

1161
01:34:49.916 --> 01:34:53.020
I imagine banishing forever
those sentiments of my own

1162
01:34:53.053 --> 01:34:55.122
that she chastened and refined.

I imagine resolving to do
what I can for Dyer.

to write in this ledger.
