I'm moving to Houston.

It's not an excuse.

and actual pens.  And in order to do this.

00:06:13.247 --> 00:06:16.000

80
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.850
As you can see. you have to write at least four letters

81
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.895
to them in the course of the semester.

82
00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:39.524
And in order for me to grade these letters

83
00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:44.695
we're going to be using this box.

84
00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.907
You will drop off your sealed envelopes.

85
00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:51.702
which I will send and mark as received as part of your grade.

86
00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.289
And the other part is to see if your pen pal wrote you back.

87
00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.624
And guys. this is important.

88
00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:02.088
do not give out any personal information. none of that.

89
00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.925

Dear Carlos. is it weird to say dear?

98
00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:55.141
The assignment says my greeting is supposed to be affectionate

99
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.142
whether I know you or not.

100
00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.353
but I guess that's the point to get to know you.

101
00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:04.692
So let's see. I'm a senior. born and bred in Baton Rouge.

102
00:08:05.359 --> 00:08:07.403
I've  never left. but I'm dying to.

103
00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:14.452
My playlist consists of anything with powerful lyrics.

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:18.915
Lourd. Billie Eilish. Florence. and The Machine.

It was nice to get your letter.

107
00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:25.255
Any distraction from this hospital room's

108
00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:26.590
a good distraction.

109
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:28.884
Do you write a lot

110
00:08:28.884 --> 00:08:30.302
because you read really well.

111
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.971
I don't write often. but I'll try.

112
00:08:34.473 --> 00:08:36.016
I'm also a senior.

113
00:08:36.058 --> 00:08:39.144
I was born in Mexico. but moved to Texas and then to Tulsa.

114
00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:42.856
I don't think you'll like the type of music I listen to

115
00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:46.902
but I love Slayer. Metallica. Linkin Park.

116
00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:50.864
Dear Carlos. you can't just say hospital

117
00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:53.158
and not say more. Are you all right?

118
00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:58.664
Also. wow. You're a metal head? I didn't see that coming.

119
00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:01.375
But if you're going to try writing.

120
00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:03.460
then I'll try something new too.

121
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:09.508
I'm going to listen to Slayer. Line your  notes in hand and yes

122
00:09:09.675 --> 00:09:12.344
I do write a lot. It's something I can control.

123
00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:16.223
The words can be mine with no one able to barge in

124
00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:17.015
and change them.

125
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:18.934
Little blue lines.

126
00:09:18.934 --> 00:09:22.980
the only guides. everything else is just white.

127
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.690
and wide open space.

128
00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:28.944
Sometimes being with people is lonelier than being alone

129
00:09:29.987 --> 00:09:32.281
but I never feel lonely when I'm writing.

130
00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:35.325
I love my best friend. but we couldn't be more different.

131
00:09:36.535 --> 00:09:37.452
She's this place.

132
00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:38.662
And she thinks it's enough.

133
00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:42.708
Don't even get me started on her boyfriend.

134
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:47.087
Here's one friend though.

135
00:09:47.963 --> 00:09:51.675
He's different. I know he's a good guy

136
00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:54.678
but he sometimes gets pulled down into all the bad stuff.

137
00:09:58.557 --> 00:10:00.976
It's hard. feeling like you're alone in the world around you.

138
00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:07.983
Dear Sarah. it's awesome that you're going to listen to Slayer.

139
00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:11.778
Most people. they wouldn't. They just say it's noise.

140
00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:14.323
Wouldn't even bother to pay attention to the lyrics.

141
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.576
I'm looking forward to reading what you think.

142
00:10:17.576 --> 00:10:19.453
even if you don't love them as much as I do.

143
00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:21.788
As for the hospital room.

144
00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.625
well. I just say you can't save everyone.

145
00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.378

Dear Sarah.

156
00:10:55.781 --> 00:10:59.034
I'm not sure if any of my letters are guaranteed anymore

157
00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:04.706
I hope so. I know you're dealing with a lot.

158
00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:08.168
This is probably the last time I write.

159
00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.588
So I've included my number and address below.

160
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:14.591
I'm glad I got to know you. Sarah.

161
00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:18.053
And I hope you're okay.

162
00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:22.015
You once wrote that I'm not doing it all alone.

163
00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:25.102
And neither are you.

164
00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.896
Know that I'll always be a friend.

171
00:12:17.154 --> 00:12:23.702
So 55 cents. - Jesus. They just charge me for everything.

172
00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:32.377
Here you go.

173
00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.342

177
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.496
It's my fault. I wanted to ask for help

178
00:13:07.496 --> 00:13:10.207
but I didn't know who to ask. I'm sorry

179
00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:12.876

We'll move them quick.

185
00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:07.973
My guy can give us a script next weekend.

186
00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:12.185
Week's a long time Jackson. and my uncle. if he finds out.

187
00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:14.229
He won't. Caleb. Fuck.  It'll work.

188
00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:18.483
Look. this is what we agreed to.

189
00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:22.028
[inaudible] It will take an hour long.  All right?

190
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.239
It's a quick buck. real quick fucking bucks.

191
00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.912
Sarah I've texted him.  Can we talk?

192
00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:32.414
I don't know Mia.

193
00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:34.708
Listen. what I did. I can't even begin to explain.

194
00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:36.960
Then don't. Your explanation won't fix anything.

195
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.920
No Sarah. wait...

196
00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:41.047
She's a piece of shit.

197
00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.215
She didn't used to be.

198
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.092
That was before she slept with Mike.

199
00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.052
Why are you standing up for her?

200
00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:49.055
I'm not standing up for Zoe. I just... I just changed.

201
00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.641
No. she changed and you got screwed over by it.

[keyboard clacking]

203
00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:24.132
Dear Carlos. You're right. You can't save up a life.

204
00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:25.508
But sometimes you can help.

205
00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:30.680
You might think you're doing it all but you're not.

207
00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:47.739
Every letter you've sent matters. I feel like you get me.

208
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:51.326
And you're listening.  Being heard means a lot.

209
00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:54.245
Especially at a time like this.

210
00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:04.297
I'm sorry to leave you hanging.

211
00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:15.976
So. the least I can say is. I'm listening.

212
00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:19.729
I'm a friend who has her share of bruises too.

213
00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.525

We're just... We're just having fun.

I just wanna do this for you.

Heard you're not with Mike anymore.

You heard right.

225
00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.603
Yeah. I get it.

226
00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:46.024
I don't think you do.

227
00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:48.193
No. I do.

228
00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:52.655
Couldn't keep a girl like you happy.

229
00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:56.868
Girl like me?

You deserve better than this place.

You ain't like others.

234

But her.

235

Dear Sarah.

238
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.338
No one's asked me about my [inaudible] memory.

239
00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:34.340
but it was my first bike.

240
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.261
It was old with a long banana seat. meant for a girl.

241
00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:39.596
but I didn't care.

242
00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:42.557
I ripped off the front basket and it was mine.

243
00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.394
I remember riding around at this lot

244
00:19:46.477 --> 00:19:47.937

248
00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:55.820
but the whole time my mom was right  behind me.

249
00:19:56.446 --> 00:20:00.241
Hand on the seat. maid uniform still on. Smiling.

250
00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:02.869
Like it was going to make me go faster.

251
00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:05.788
I kept turning back to see her

252
00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:08.917
and when I did that. I turned and I lost my balance.

253
00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:13.087
She was there. Ready to let go when I had enough speed

254
00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:16.299
or hang on when I didn't.

255
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.719
Yo um. you know

256
00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.262
where the English teacher would be at?

257
00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:22.555
Ah. yes. round the corner.

Okay. appreciate it.

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:33.858
How did she get your address?

264
00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:37.403
I gave it to her.

265
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.739
You weren't supposed to. - I mean

266
00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:42.867
you can't tell us to be friends and then just expect us to stop.

267
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:44.953
It's not fair.

I never read any of these.

270
00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:57.382
I always just assumed students would write one line and send it.

274
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.977
She had it in her yearbook meeting her term.

275
00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:12.397
I was hoping she'd put her writing talents to use there.

276
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.566
But see. she did in these.

All I need is his number and email. anything.

If I give out personal information. I could lose my job.

281

I won't tell anyone.

282
00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:35.211
What I can do.

283
00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:40.591
is say that everyone's in the year book.

284
00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:42.635

00:27:10.756 --> 00:27:12.341
It's fucking generous.

Gosh. Sorry.

381
00:31:04.531 --> 00:31:06.950
You know. I get a little lost in here.

382
00:31:08.827 --> 00:31:11.830
Do you want some coffee? It'll be ready in a few.

383
00:31:12.622 --> 00:31:15.333
I have to have tea around here somewhere.

384
00:31:16.501 --> 00:31:19.337
No. Um. where am I?

385
00:31:20.171 --> 00:31:23.884
My shoes. phone. - It's okay honey.

386
00:31:24.467 --> 00:31:25.260
You're safe.

387
00:31:26.136 --> 00:31:29.556
And you're here so everything's fine.

388
00:31:32.142 --> 00:31:35.812
Hello. I'm William Hayden. - She knows.

Sarah Blake. - Sarah. That's wonderful.

391
00:31:44.154 --> 00:31:47.324
How about we get your shoes and give you a minute.

Diane. maybe coffee.

393

I heard a noise. [inaudible]

395

That's my daughter. Ella.

She's beautiful.

402
00:33:27.132 --> 00:33:28.550
Yeah. she was.

403
00:33:34.055 --> 00:33:38.101
She left for a friend's house almost three years ago.

404
00:33:39.561 --> 00:33:40.395
She never got there.

405
00:33:41.062 --> 00:33:42.063
She never came back.

406
00:33:43.732 --> 00:33:44.524
The police?

407
00:33:44.899 --> 00:33:46.735
They started off strong

408
00:33:46.735 --> 00:33:50.321
but what else. the case was never closed.

409
00:33:50.864 --> 00:33:53.700
And they never legally declared her so...

410
00:33:54.826 --> 00:33:57.287
So they never found out what happened to her. - No.

411
00:33:59.497 --> 00:34:02.042
I didn't mean to I'm sorry.

412
00:34:03.752 --> 00:34:06.504
Yeah. Well. we are too.

413
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:19.184
Thank you for everything.

414
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:21.102
Wait.

415
00:34:24.355 --> 00:34:26.107
The morning still carries a chill.

Dear Carlos.

420
00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.222
My memory is amazing.

421
00:34:58.181 --> 00:35:00.725
I remember when I was young. seven. maybe.

422
00:35:01.643 --> 00:35:03.311
My friend and I would spread out our toys

423
00:35:03.311 --> 00:35:05.480
on a carpet. Running down

424
00:35:05.522 --> 00:35:07.065
a long hotel hallway.

425
00:35:08.441 --> 00:35:11.444
The carpet had large blue stripes circling around

426
00:35:11.444 --> 00:35:14.906
these green wisps like branches.

427
00:35:16.241 --> 00:35:18.284
At one moment the design was a road.

428
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.912
Then little cars would speed around.

429
00:35:21.955 --> 00:35:24.082
The next an ocean. where her brother's

430
00:35:24.082 --> 00:35:26.918
action figures would swim fast distances

431
00:35:27.502 --> 00:35:29.462
to save the Barbie we shared between us.

432
00:35:30.338 --> 00:35:32.590
Carpet was whatever we wanted it to be.

433
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.469
Everyone else just stepped on our roads or oceans.

434
00:35:37.387 --> 00:35:39.848
They didn't see that it was important for two little kids

435
00:35:41.224 --> 00:35:43.226
and that it's still important to me.

436
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:16.843

We don't sit and talk.

449

Did you eat?

450
00:38:15.044 --> 00:38:18.798
No. there's nothing.

You got hair like your daddy.

463
00:39:16.689 --> 00:39:20.485
but not in the way you need her to be. You deserve better.

Sometimes. I wish it was just that easy.

I'm not going to try to hurt you.

I just thought you were someone else.

Since you're right here...

483
00:40:13.246 --> 00:40:15.123
It was already trashed when I got here.

484
00:40:17.375 --> 00:40:19.293
Trailers don't have much copper in them.

485
00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.671
So the beggars they don't attack them.

486
00:40:21.671 --> 00:40:23.923
like they do the houses and in Neahwa Park.

487
00:40:25.383 --> 00:40:26.217
Right.

488
00:40:28.428 --> 00:40:29.262

Told you I don't know no Sarah.

490

Never seen her?

491
00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:46.362
Do you know her?

492
00:40:50.241 --> 00:40:51.742
So we warned her...

493
00:40:53.744 --> 00:40:55.830
And Caleb couldn't find it anywhere.

494
00:40:58.082 --> 00:40:59.917
No. he said he looked everywhere.

495
00:41:05.256 --> 00:41:07.633
I'm sorry. I'll buy you another one.

496

No.

It happened so quick

501
00:41:23.858 --> 00:41:30.072
he tried. he just stripped off the sweater

502
00:41:30.072 --> 00:41:30.990
and I just ran.

503
00:41:31.991 --> 00:41:32.783
Just got away.

504
00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:35.411
I'll handle it.

505
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.667
We sold them and we ain't got double.

506
00:41:41.418 --> 00:41:42.711
What about your car with the scripts?

507
00:41:42.711 --> 00:41:43.504
They'll come through.

508
00:41:44.087 --> 00:41:45.923
Fuck. Maybe we should've never done this.

509
00:41:46.381 --> 00:41:48.300
Well. it's done. right?

510
00:41:48.884 --> 00:41:49.718
We wanted this.

511
00:41:52.679 --> 00:41:54.765
Not me. it's what you want.

512
00:41:54.848 --> 00:41:56.433
And I was kind enough to cut you in.

513
00:41:57.059 --> 00:41:58.477
and what is it that you've ever wanted that

514
00:41:58.477 --> 00:42:00.729
you actually got without me?

515
00:42:01.146 --> 00:42:02.064
Is it money?

516
00:42:02.397 --> 00:42:04.149
Some place of your own?

517
00:42:05.817 --> 00:42:06.610
Is it Sarah?

518
00:42:07.861 --> 00:42:11.365
Now. I see it. but she don't bud. right?

519
00:42:13.367 --> 00:42:16.328
And she never fucking will. if it wasn't for me

520
00:42:16.328 --> 00:42:17.746
she wouldn't even be near you.

521
00:42:18.455 --> 00:42:20.207
She wouldn't even fucking look at you.

522
00:42:20.582 --> 00:42:21.875
Just lucky over there.

523
00:42:22.501 --> 00:42:24.294

I can't remember the last time someone tucked me in.

528
00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:37.516
They want me to come back. have dinner with them.

Crazy woman cooking. but...

530
00:42:39.685 --> 00:42:42.938
No. she just. she wanted me to be someone else.

It's a free meal. I guess .

532
00:42:47.067 --> 00:42:48.902

733
00:58:32.429 --> 00:58:34.640
In a place where nothing reaches.

734
00:58:35.891 --> 00:58:38.101
Friends. Sun.

735
00:58:38.602 --> 00:58:39.520
Sounds.

736
00:58:40.103 --> 00:58:40.938
Life.

737
00:58:41.855 --> 00:58:45.609
I wonder if what's being hidden is broken beyond repair.

738
00:58:45.859 --> 00:58:46.652
Cracks to the point where you

739
00:58:46.735 --> 00:58:48.654
can't see who's looking back at you.

740
00:58:53.784 --> 00:58:56.537
If you're the person you want to become. or the person

741
00:58:56.537 --> 00:58:59.540
you're so scared of being. no one will let you in.

742
00:59:00.457 --> 00:59:01.542
No one will forgive you.

743
00:59:05.337 --> 00:59:08.465
Find you underneath the filth that you helped create.

744
00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:21.186
[birds chirping]

745
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:56.096
And while we don't have all the details. at least two

746
00:59:56.263 --> 00:59:58.807
were pronounced dead on the scene. with one

747
00:59:58.974 --> 01:00:01.059
a yet to be identified teenager.

748
01:00:01.727 --> 01:00:02.728
Gunshots were reported

749
01:00:02.728 --> 01:00:05.022
late last night. but as of this airing

750
01:00:05.022 --> 01:00:07.190
no suspects have been identified.

751
01:00:09.943 --> 01:00:11.445
At least two were pronounced dead

752
01:00:11.445 --> 01:00:15.532
on the scene with one. a yet to be identified teenager.

753
01:00:22.331 --> 01:00:23.165
Did he send you?

754
01:00:23.206 --> 01:00:25.292
Jackson's seen you going back there to her house.

755
01:00:26.585 --> 01:00:28.253
So you never saw what was in his car?

756
01:00:28.962 --> 01:00:30.839
What he was holding? -No. listen. this is important.

757
01:00:30.839 --> 01:00:31.632
He thinks you're gonna talk

758
01:00:31.632 --> 01:00:32.466
or tell someone.

759
01:00:33.258 --> 01:00:34.217
Tell her what?

760
01:00:34.676 --> 01:00:35.927
That it was my fault?

761
01:00:36.928 --> 01:00:39.473
You know. I can't say anything. - Then at least stay away

762
01:00:39.473 --> 01:00:40.265
from her.

763
01:00:40.807 --> 01:00:42.768
I can't. she didn't deserve any of this.

764
01:00:42.851 --> 01:00:44.603
And you're trying to make it right?

765
01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:46.563
I'm just trying to get away from things in my life that

766
01:00:46.563 --> 01:00:48.398
are wrong. - Including me.

767
01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:49.775
If you stay with him. yes.

768
01:00:50.651 --> 01:00:51.902
Just let her be. please.

769
01:00:58.408 --> 01:01:00.118
[door opens and closes]

770
01:01:01.453 --> 01:01:02.871
Where were you?

771
01:01:03.288 --> 01:01:04.081
What do you mean. I was...

772
01:01:04.081 --> 01:01:05.332
Yesterday?

773
01:01:05.874 --> 01:01:07.250
I fucking waited for you.

774
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:10.128
I needed you to be there with me at my appointment.

775
01:01:11.505 --> 01:01:12.964
I can't be well.

776
01:01:13.256 --> 01:01:15.884
Without you. I can't make any of this work without...

777
01:01:15.884 --> 01:01:17.594
I'm not a fucking excuse!

778
01:01:18.095 --> 01:01:20.931
I'm not the reason you're like this. you're the fucking reason.

779
01:01:21.056 --> 01:01:22.891
And my life just gets pulled down into it.

780
01:01:22.891 --> 01:01:23.684
[slaps]

781
01:01:30.899 --> 01:01:32.567
You need a fucking excuse.

782
01:01:33.694 --> 01:01:36.154
What the hell is that huh?`

783
01:01:36.363 --> 01:01:37.447
I'm not your father.

784
01:01:37.989 --> 01:01:39.449
Tell everybody I did it.

785
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.660
You have no idea.

786
01:01:42.494 --> 01:01:44.371
None. You don't know the pain that I've

787
01:01:44.371 --> 01:01:47.666
been through every God damn day. trying to provide

788
01:01:47.666 --> 01:01:48.709
for you.

789
01:01:48.709 --> 01:01:49.501
You're sorry.

790
01:01:49.501 --> 01:01:51.044
selfish. spoiled little ass.

791
01:01:52.421 --> 01:01:54.339
It is [inaudible]

792
01:01:54.464 --> 01:01:56.425
And I just want to provide for you.

793
01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.804
What kind of providing is this?

794
01:02:01.012 --> 01:02:04.224
I come home every day. not knowing what I'm going to get.

795
01:02:04.641 --> 01:02:08.103
Sometimes I wish that you're still Goddamn high

796
01:02:08.103 --> 01:02:09.479
that you'll just let me swing out of here

797
01:02:09.479 --> 01:02:10.272
and never return.

798
01:02:10.981 --> 01:02:12.315
Then fucking do it.

799
01:02:13.233 --> 01:02:15.318
Leave. Get the fuck out.

800
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:19.573
You're not special.

801
01:02:21.408 --> 01:02:22.200
You're not.

802
01:02:23.243 --> 01:02:25.495
So why don't you just leave me here with the little

803
01:02:25.495 --> 01:02:27.706
enjoyment I have left

804
01:02:28.123 --> 01:02:29.708
because I don't need your judgment.

805
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:32.669
Fine.

806
01:02:33.712 --> 01:02:34.504
You want enjoyment?

807
01:02:37.382 --> 01:02:38.175
Fine!

808
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:39.468
This is what you are?

809
01:02:41.845 --> 01:02:43.889
If this is more important than me

810
01:02:44.181 --> 01:02:46.057
then the least that I could do is help.

811
01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:47.142
Stop it. Stop it.

812
01:02:47.142 --> 01:02:47.934
No. no. no.

813
01:02:47.934 --> 01:02:51.146
You said that you wanted me to be a helpful. dutiful daughter.

814
01:02:51.646 --> 01:02:54.149
[inaudible] Just stop it!

815
01:02:54.149 --> 01:02:54.941
[crying]

816
01:02:55.317 --> 01:02:58.904
I'm always there for you more than a daughter should be.

817
01:02:59.154 --> 01:03:00.822
And for once. for once

818
01:03:01.198 --> 01:03:02.199
I wish you'd be there for me.

819
01:03:06.745 --> 01:03:08.038
[wailing]

820
01:03:16.546 --> 01:03:19.382
Who was it? - I don't know. No. you do.

821
01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:21.051
I told you. I don't know.

822
01:03:21.843 --> 01:03:23.845
You do. you do.

823
01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:26.848
And I was conveniently jumped for it.

824
01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:32.145
I looked up what happened at the house.

825
01:03:33.688 --> 01:03:34.815
Was it Sarah?

826
01:03:36.274 --> 01:03:37.234
Did she die?

827
01:03:38.735 --> 01:03:40.111
Please. I need to know.

828
01:03:40.111 --> 01:03:42.364
I can't stop now. - She didn't stop.

829
01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.034
I asked her to stop. to walk away.

830
01:03:47.244 --> 01:03:48.537
God if she would've just listened to me

831
01:03:48.537 --> 01:03:50.080
if she would've just not shut me out.

832
01:03:50.205 --> 01:03:51.456
nothing would have happened.

833
01:03:57.462 --> 01:03:58.672
So you know what happened.

834
01:04:01.424 --> 01:04:02.217
[inaudible]

835
01:04:03.468 --> 01:04:05.220
Worse is going to happen.

836
01:04:07.097 --> 01:04:08.223
Maybe to meet.

837
01:04:09.432 --> 01:04:11.101
I need to know what happened.

838
01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.689
I need to know what happened.

839
01:04:18.108 --> 01:04:19.067
Who was it?

840
01:04:28.493 --> 01:04:29.286
[door closes]

841
01:04:40.672 --> 01:04:41.464

Hi.

844

Mom?

845
01:04:50.265 --> 01:04:51.099
Mom?

846
01:04:52.225 --> 01:04:53.894
Did you take two eighties?

847
01:04:59.441 --> 01:05:01.902
No. I wasn't supposed to be like this.

848
01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:06.865

849
01:05:06.948 --> 01:05:07.741
But he's [inaudible]

I wasn't supposed to be like this.

851
01:05:17.292 --> 01:05:19.377
Just wanted you to be happy.

Just want you to be happy.

854

I once loved your hair.

855
01:05:57.624 --> 01:05:59.501
You're [inaudible] like your father.

Your eye.

858
01:06:42.043 --> 01:06:43.461
What happened to your eye?

859
01:06:43.795 --> 01:06:44.587
It's nothing.

860
01:06:45.213 --> 01:06:48.675
Wait. Ella Joan Hayden. he'd wait right...

I'm not your daughter! I'm not her!

She's not coming back!

863
01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:52.762
Okay?

864
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:55.515
Trust me. you'd never want me as your daughter.

865
01:06:55.724 --> 01:06:57.809
You'd never even considered me up for [inaudible].

Nah. you can score over at Oaks junction.

869

I ain't here to score. - Then fucking leave.

870
01:07:51.863 --> 01:07:52.906
I need to talk to you.

871

No. you need to get the fuck outta here.

It's important.

01:07:58.328 --> 01:07:59.496
It ain't important to me.

Listen. we need to talk.

875
01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:04.918

Sarah. you gotta go.

883
01:09:13.653 --> 01:09:15.697
You kind of grab everything right now and go.

884
01:09:15.738 --> 01:09:16.531
Caleb. what do you mean?

885
01:09:16.531 --> 01:09:17.532
He's here.

What are you doing?

01:09:24.956 --> 01:09:25.832
I'm sorry.

891
01:09:31.713 --> 01:09:32.714
Aahh!

[intense suspenseful music]

893
01:09:45.351 --> 01:09:47.103
Now I get why Jackson kept you high.

894
01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:51.357
Keep you from being fucking trouble.

895
01:09:57.405 --> 01:09:59.115
You got till I finish.

896
01:10:00.366 --> 01:10:01.159
Alright.

897
01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.746
What do you remember from that night?

898
01:10:04.913 --> 01:10:09.334
Caleb took my gun. tried to swap some meds from abroad

899
01:10:09.417 --> 01:10:13.588
in Eden Park. Got hairy. but she knows this.

900
01:10:13.588 --> 01:10:14.964
So why the fuck do you care?

901
01:10:16.257 --> 01:10:17.508
Cause Caleb never did that.

902
01:10:19.385 --> 01:10:20.345
He went there to help.

903
01:10:20.595 --> 01:10:21.387
Bullshit.

904
01:10:22.013 --> 01:10:23.890
He went there cause he was fucking dumb.

905
01:10:24.849 --> 01:10:27.310
[inaudible manned up. got himself fucking shot.

906
01:10:28.728 --> 01:10:29.562
And who shot him?

907
01:10:30.939 --> 01:10:34.317
The only one with a finger in a gun broads included

908
01:10:34.317 --> 01:10:35.693
can stand their ground.

909
01:10:38.154 --> 01:10:39.322
They never found a gun.

910
01:10:39.822 --> 01:10:44.244
Every article. every report. they said the gun was never found.

911
01:10:44.494 --> 01:10:46.663
Doesn't change the fact he got a bullet through his chest.

912
01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:48.373
Hmm?

913
01:10:49.707 --> 01:10:53.962
I told the cops. he took it. That's all they needed to know.

914
01:10:55.838 --> 01:10:57.882
It don't matter to me if they can't find it.

915
01:10:58.841 --> 01:11:00.176
But it's not lost.

916
01:11:01.719 --> 01:11:02.512
Never was.

917
01:11:03.429 --> 01:11:04.889
Why are you telling me this girl?

918
01:11:06.516 --> 01:11:07.976
With him no less?

919
01:11:09.102 --> 01:11:10.603
Cause we need to know.

920
01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:11.854
About what?

921
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:15.775
Why he killed your nephew?

922
01:11:17.777 --> 01:11:19.404
Maybe he did the same to Sarah.

01:12:15.626 --> 01:12:17.295
Get him the fuck over here.

938
01:12:31.601 --> 01:12:33.061
If you wanted that element of surprise

939
01:12:33.061 --> 01:12:34.354
you should've parked around back.

940
01:12:35.938 --> 01:12:38.191
Where's Adam? - He's out.

941
01:12:40.026 --> 01:12:41.444
And I'm not the surprise.

942
01:12:46.532 --> 01:12:47.325
Have a seat.

943
01:13:01.339 --> 01:13:03.466
Where the fuck did you get those and that?

944
01:13:05.385 --> 01:13:07.178
I'm here because you fucked up.

945
01:13:07.303 --> 01:13:08.763
I said I'd pay the price for it.

946
01:13:10.723 --> 01:13:12.225
I just need to know how high.

947
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:16.938
The Haydens. Caleb. - Caleb?

948
01:13:20.441 --> 01:13:24.070
He just got in the way. - And Sarah?

949
01:13:25.988 --> 01:13:27.573
Did you kill her too?

950
01:13:54.767 --> 01:13:55.643
Did you kill them?

951
01:13:56.227 --> 01:13:57.728
Why the fuck would I tell you that?

952
01:13:59.814 --> 01:14:00.690
You're coming here.

953
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:02.692
got your chest fucking puffed.

954
01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:04.318
Do you think that you're going to leave?

955
01:14:05.486 --> 01:14:06.279
Yeah.

956
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:09.115
I want an answer.

957
01:14:12.118 --> 01:14:13.911
This whole time that you're trying to act tough

958
01:14:13.911 --> 01:14:15.913
I'm just trying to remember how many bullets I've left to

01:16:46.607 --> 01:16:47.983
Sorry. I'm just about done.

969
01:17:05.417 --> 01:17:08.086
Sarah and I were friends for as long as we could remember.

970
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:12.257
My family owns this hotel and her mom worked here.

971
01:17:14.009 --> 01:17:17.304
During her shifts. Sarah would come over

972
01:17:17.304 --> 01:17:19.848
and we'd.. - Put on the carpet?

973
01:17:21.475 --> 01:17:22.267
Yeah.

974
01:17:24.394 --> 01:17:27.773
We'd be in our own innocent world.

975
01:17:28.982 --> 01:17:30.776
Has stepping around us.

976
01:17:37.658 --> 01:17:41.870
But then we grew up. They ruined it.

977
01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.626
It happened just after this photo was taken.

978
01:17:50.128 --> 01:17:52.673
She didn't talk to me for a while.

979
01:17:54.132 --> 01:17:56.176
But then...  - She came here.

980
01:17:58.762 --> 01:17:59.721
To ask for help.

981
01:18:03.684 --> 01:18:04.893

983
01:18:33.630 --> 01:18:35.132
Go to the bathroom.

984
01:18:38.927 --> 01:18:40.220
I've got clothes for you.

985
01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:41.930
I think we're still the same size.

986
01:18:42.431 --> 01:18:43.640
These are for tonight

987
01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.392
and I've got a few more for tomorrow.

988
01:18:46.184 --> 01:18:46.977
Thank you.

989
01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:54.943
Is everything okay?

990
01:19:01.116 --> 01:19:01.908
No.

991
01:19:03.076 --> 01:19:04.286
Do you want to talk about it?

992
01:19:12.335 --> 01:19:13.128
[sighs]

993
01:19:27.684 --> 01:19:32.355
The next day she left. took a bus. gave me your address.

994
01:19:33.523 --> 01:19:36.276
told me to wait to send a letter after a year.

995
01:19:37.736 --> 01:19:41.406
With nothing and trace back to me. I guess

996
01:19:45.744 --> 01:19:49.039
She said that if it was meant to make it to you. it would.

997
01:19:51.291 --> 01:19:52.876
Did she tell you where she was going?

998
01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:58.924
No. I tried. but she wanted to protect me. us. I think.

999
01:19:59.841 --> 01:20:02.052
Someone she shouldn't have forgiven

1000
01:20:02.052 --> 01:20:05.013
but dead and someone she never met.

1001
01:20:10.101 --> 01:20:10.936
That was Sarah.

1002
01:20:12.062 --> 01:20:13.480
She was... - A friend.

1003
01:20:16.483 --> 01:20:17.901
Are you gonna keep looking?

1004
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:25.158
I don't know where to look.

1005
01:20:26.576 --> 01:20:27.619
Here on my last.

1006
01:20:36.086 --> 01:20:36.920
Thank you.

1007
01:20:40.799 --> 01:20:45.220
I'm glad that she. she wasn't alone.

1008
01:20:46.805 --> 01:20:47.639
She had you.

1009
01:20:51.977 --> 01:20:54.104
No. just keep that.

1010
01:20:55.730 --> 01:20:57.232
For you to remember her by.

1011
01:20:59.943 --> 01:21:00.735

1013
