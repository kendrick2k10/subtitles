No. That one was deleted.

And. like I said this was way
before this got popular. so -

203

but I'm curious. What's your interest in this?

the connection that it started with her.

685
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:21.770
But after today. I'd rather
not be home alone. so.

686

My parents... um.

692
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:39.840
My parents are dead. And I
live in an apartment. Alone.

693
01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:42.870
And no boyfriend. Not... not now. anyways.

694
01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.480

we eat. You don't have to. but-

Raegan: So. I'm probably
not supposed to ask.

702
01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:37.940
But considering Becca never brings
her clients over I'm guessing it's okay.

And you really think there's
something dangerous about it?

706
01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.450
Raegan: So what do you think
it is? The music? The dance?

707
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:50.480
Or...

708
01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.560
Or maybe it's just TikTok itself.

709

How so?

710
01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:57.600

to make kids dumber than they already are.

711

This one just happens to be worse somehow.

712

Rebecca: It's true. If you spend more
than 20 minutes with someone under the age-

713
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.130
-of 25. At some point they'll
spontaneously break into some-

714
01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:11.520
-ridiculous. terribly choreographed dance. And
it's so random. It's like they can't help it.

what it's like for anyone with half a brain.

Raegan: She's really that upset
about you being a jerk to TikTok?

722
01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:49.570
No. she just had kind of a stressful day.

723
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.810
Oh.

724

Um... Grace. Why?

726
01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:01.530
She looks kind of familiar. Just wondering
if I saw one of her videos before.

Did something happen to her?

728

Rebecca: I don't really
know. I didn't really ask her.

729
01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.800
I just kind of assumed she had some
paranormal experiences like the others.

730

on one of your clients.

She's a young girl.

they're not some creepy sex offender.

and you should know that.

How long has it been
since you had a good drink?

741

I'm 19. My Dad let me have a Malibu

That'll be around midnight.

we can check it out first thing in the morning.

748

01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:29.130
Maybe. But why go home and
be alone if you don't have to?

Obviously I'm better now. But that
had nothing to do with my faith or God.

1049

And according to the Reverend last time I
was here. he didn't think I had enough faith.
