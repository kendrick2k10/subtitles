00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:27.588

-A dingleberry.
-Okay. calm-calm...

41
00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:32.927
Dingle up your asshole.
because he ain't worth shit.

42
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.178
Okay. calm... calm down. calm down.

43
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:35.554
Look. you'll be able...
we'll figure it out.

44
00:01:35.638 --> 00:01:36.847
Come on. let's just go.

45
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:38.891
-It's not the end of the world.
It's okay. -Shit.

46
00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:41.644
-- For you. it's not.
-- We're okay.

47
00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:44.688
Hi. class. Sorry I'm late.

48
00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:46.899
Whew. goodness.

49
00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:48.776
Okay. so if you've done the reading--

50
00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.778
which you should have--

51
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:53.656
you'd have noticed that there's
a big old trigger warning

52
00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:56.617
next to the syllabus on today's class.

53
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.994
And I know that we're
inches away from spring break.

54
00:01:59.078 --> 00:02:01.831
but if you could just maintain
your focus and respectability

55
00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:04.041
till the end of the day.
I'll be most appreciative.

56
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.043
Okay. so we good to go?

57
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.504
-I found some extra tickets
to Blackout. -Really?

58
00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:09.964
So we've been talking about

59
00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:11.882
the power of language.

60
00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:15.553
and today we're going to be
talking about hate speech.

61
00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:18.514
Now. before I go any further.

62
00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:20.307
I just feel like I need to restate

63
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:21.934
the trigger warning. so are we good?

64
00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.354
-That's cute.
-Stop.

65
00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:28.983
- Yeah. okay. so let's
talk about the infamous...

66
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.485
...N-word.

67
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:40.411
The word "nigger" has had a
very long and terrible history.

68
00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:46.292
It occupies a unique space in
the modern American vernacular.

69
00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:49.169
The word's so taboo that it's
clearly making a lot of you

70
00:02:49.253 --> 00:02:51.630
feel uncomfortable with me just
saying it right here right now

71
00:02:51.714 --> 00:02:54.800
in a very isolated academic context.

72
00:02:54.884 --> 00:02:57.678
Now. my question is to you lot:

73
00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:02.266
What makes this word so powerful?

74
00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.685
Anybody.

75
00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:06.186
Yes.

76
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.273
I mean. because it's racist.

77
00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:13.360
- I think we could
all agree it is racist. yes.

78
00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:15.154
But there are many racist.
offensive words.

79
00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:16.655
What makes "nigger" different?

80
00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.240
It originates from the Spanish...

81
00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:20.451
Hey. Is that shit even allowed?

82
00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:22.286
It's on the syllabus.

83
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.915
Um. there-there was a...
a trigger warning.

84
00:03:25.998 --> 00:03:27.374
Trigger warning. these nuts.

85
00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:29.376
-That shit is not right.
-- And then. of course.

86
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.295
with an "A" at the end. we've got "nigga."

87
00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.213
Bro. she keeps fucking saying it.

88
00:03:33.297 --> 00:03:34.924
-- Okay. -- She just
said "nigga" three times.

89
00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:36.175
But. uh. okay.

90
00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:38.093
Well. what do you want me to do about it?

91
00:03:38.177 --> 00:03:39.845
-Ask her. Inquire about it.
-I-m-I'm not asking her.

92
00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.388
-Ask her. Kunle.
-I'm not gonna ask her.

93
00:03:41.472 --> 00:03:42.598
You don't want to ask. Ask her.

94
00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:43.682
She can't answer this question?

95
00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:45.059
She's British.

96
00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:46.727
May-Maybe she just doesn't know.

97
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.687
Give a fuck if she British. boy?

98
00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:50.522
Ask her. why is she teaching a class

99
00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:52.816
on some shit she don't know shit about?

100
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.152
I. um. don't want to put you two

101
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:58.238
on the spot or anything. but...

102
00:03:58.322 --> 00:04:00.324
you must have something to say.

103
00:04:01.951 --> 00:04:04.370
Please. This is a safe space.

104
00:04:04.453 --> 00:04:07.873
What do you think it is that
keeps this word so powerful?

105
00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.756
Look. it was...

106
00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.383
Sean. if it bothered you so much.

107
00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:19.051
you could have said something.

108
00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.303
You could have said anything.
You didn't say a word.

109
00:04:21.387 --> 00:04:22.596
You just... you just sat there.

110
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.516
Yeah. in silent protest.

111
00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.184
-Okay. silent protest.
-- Kunle?

112
00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.436
Oh. shit. Okay. okay. um... act cool.

113
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.230
-Do I have anything in my nose?
I'm okay? -- Kunle.

114
00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:33.524
-Hey. Guys. -Just be cool.
Be cool. Sean. Be cool.

115
00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:35.484
-Hi.
-Hey.

116
00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:37.486
That was... ooh.

117
00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:38.654
W-Weird.

118
00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:40.322
Fucked-up is what it was.

119
00:04:40.406 --> 00:04:42.992
-- She should not have put
you guys on the spot like that. -No.

120
00:04:43.075 --> 00:04:45.327
I'm on the Student Senate.
if you guys want to. like.

121
00:04:45.411 --> 00:04:47.329
start a movement or something.

122
00:04:47.413 --> 00:04:49.540
-Uh...
-But it's totally up to you.

123
00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.041
Like. no pressure.

124
00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:53.335
Yeah. no. no. no. No. pressure. We. um...

125
00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.338
-We will think about it.
-- Cool.

126
00:04:56.422 --> 00:04:58.340
-Yeah. uh...

127
00:04:58.424 --> 00:05:00.926
So. uh. you...

128
00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:03.429
So. you going out tonight. B?

129
00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:06.265
Uh. for once. I am.

130
00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.975
-Mm. -Yeah. got a pass
to Underground.

131
00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.977
-- Nice. Nice.
-- Oh. shit.

132
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.353
Nice. That's really good.

133
00:05:11.437 --> 00:05:13.230
Yeah. Are-are you guys?

134
00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:16.066
Yeah. Yeah. we're just gonna go
to a couple parties and...

135
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.359
Cool.

136
00:05:17.443 --> 00:05:19.361
Seven parties. actually.

137
00:05:19.445 --> 00:05:21.405
Are you guys doing a Legendary Tour?

138
00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.907
-Mm-hmm.
-- Wow. wow. wow.

139
00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:26.744
It took me
three weeks of ass kissing

140
00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:28.537
just to get into one.

141
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.621
-- Oof.
-Lot of butt.

142
00:05:29.705 --> 00:05:30.706
So... lot of butt.

143
00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:31.790
-Oh. God.
-Lot of butt.

144
00:05:31.874 --> 00:05:33.000
Good thing you didn't get pink eye.

145
00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:37.129
-From all the ass kissing.

146
00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:41.008
Yeah. it's not really...
it's not really about

147
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.926
the. uh... the-the parties. though.

148
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.970
It's just this inside joke
that-that we've had

149
00:05:45.054 --> 00:05:46.430
-since freshman year.
-Oh.

150
00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.932
We actually are gonna be
the first Black men

151
00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:51.643
to complete a Legendary Tour here
at Buchanan.

152
00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:53.228
-Right.
-Is that...

153
00:05:53.312 --> 00:05:55.522
like. something that people keep track of?

154
00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:57.524
-Well. yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

155
00:05:57.608 --> 00:05:59.735
See. the Black Student Union.

156
00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:01.945
right. they got this thing
called the Hall of Firsts.

157
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.906
-You get a fancy plaque

158
00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:06.575
any time that you are the first
Black person to do something

159
00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:08.035
-here at Buchanan.
-- Mm-hmm.

160
00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:09.411
Like First Black Newspaper Editor.

161
00:06:09.495 --> 00:06:11.455
- First Black
Student Government President.

162
00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.916
Also. they do things for stuff
that's not due to academics.

163
00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:16.460
like First Black Man
to Step Foot in Omicron.

164
00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.003
or first Black woman

165
00:06:18.087 --> 00:06:19.588
to ever even make it
into the Hall of Firsts.

166
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.381
We're gonna make history today.

167
00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:23.592
being the first Black men
to complete a Legendary Tour.

168
00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.219
-Right.
-We're actually going to get

169
00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:27.304
-our Blackout passes right now.
-- Right.

170
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.806
-Cool. Text me.
-I'll te... I'll text you.

171
00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.682
-Okay.
-Bye.

172
00:06:30.766 --> 00:06:32.017
Bye.

173
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.689
She wants your dick. bro.

174
00:06:37.773 --> 00:06:38.816
No. she's just being nice.

175
00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.110
Yeah. she is being nice-- to your dick.

176
00:06:49.201 --> 00:06:52.121
Wait. okay. on-on the other hand.

177
00:06:52.204 --> 00:06:54.039
it's a class about blasphemy and taboos.

178
00:06:54.123 --> 00:06:56.041
Like. it's literally called
Blasphemy and Taboos.

179
00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:57.543
-Mm-hmm.
-If we got her fired.

180
00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:59.253
would that be censorship?

181
00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:00.796
'Cause I'm against censorship.

182
00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:01.922
That was some willy-nilly-ass shit.

183
00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.173
Like. she didn't have to say it.

184
00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:04.758
She just wanted to. She wanted a reaction.

185
00:07:04.842 --> 00:07:05.968
Whoa. wait. wait. wait.

186
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.594
Okay. hold on. hold on. hold on. hold on.

187
00:07:07.678 --> 00:07:10.013
But that was kind of the point. right?

188
00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:11.765
To analyze us.

189
00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:14.518
She wants to analyze
why we reacted that way.

190
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.186
Like. why is it so bad?

191
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.438
Think about this. So. there's a white man.

192
00:07:18.522 --> 00:07:20.357
He's in the woods alone. all right?

193
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.025
He says the N-word. Is it bad?

194
00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:23.735
Wait. your white man goes to the forest

195
00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:25.529
-just to say the N-word?
-Well. no. no. He's never...

196
00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.239
He... Okay. think about it.
He's never said it before.

197
00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.782
-Uh-huh.
-He will never say it again.

198
00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:30.826
And he doesn't hate us.
He's not. like. that type.

199
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.829
He just wants to just
whisper it quietly to himself.

200
00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:35.831
You. just. you know...

201
00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.291
"Nigger."

202
00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:39.334
It's fucked-up. dummy.

203
00:07:39.418 --> 00:07:41.003
-What?
-What? That's fucked...

204
00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:42.629
You're such an Oreo. trying to justify it.

205
00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:44.256
I'm not... I'm not a...

206
00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:45.924
-Okay. think about this...
-Look. look. look. Look. calm down.

207
00:07:46.008 --> 00:07:47.217
You're thinking about it
too much. all right?

208
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:48.719
It's not that complicated.

209
00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:51.346
We got one rule that we ask
for white people to respect.

210
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.182
-Mm-hmm. -Thou shalt not
say this one word.

211
00:07:53.265 --> 00:07:54.474
-Right?
-Right.

212
00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:56.560
But they don't like for us
to tell them what to do.

213
00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:58.353
So they find loopholes.

214
00:07:58.437 --> 00:08:01.398
So when your white man says
"nigger" in the forest.

215
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.609
he breaketh the covenant. all right?

216
00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:05.903
It's not. like. evil-evil.

217
00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.363
like. you know. "rawr."

218
00:08:08.447 --> 00:08:09.823
but it's disrespectful.

219
00:08:09.907 --> 00:08:11.575
-Right. -Anybody ever
called you a nigger?

220
00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.035
You call me "nigga" all the time.

221
00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:15.329
-No. nigga. not like that.
I mean. like... -

222
00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:16.914
To your fucking face.

223
00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:18.373
Yeah. I don't know. like. online.

224
00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:19.625
people say the word. like...

225
00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.084
No. not-not online.

226
00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:24.296
Like. disrespectful.
right here to your face.

227
00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:25.547
No.

228
00:08:25.631 --> 00:08:27.382
Oh. well. fuck it.

229
00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:30.719
♪ I'm already doing too much ♪

230
00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:34.431
♪ Reach down in my pocket.
my wallet missing. boy. tighten up... ♪

231
00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:37.768
I just can't go too hard tonight.

232
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.770
I have to be back here
really early in the morning

233
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.021
to check my cultures.

234
00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.273
You sound like a young mom. Le.

235
00:08:44.483 --> 00:08:46.193
Them like your little fungus babies.

236
00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.861
They are the bacteria.

237
00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:49.780
And yes. they are my little babies.

238
00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.114
Mm-hmm.

239
00:08:51.198 --> 00:08:52.950
Yeah. who's gonna get Daddy published?

240
00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.743
Hmm? Who? We are.

241
00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.370
Yes. you are.

242
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.623
What?

243
00:09:00.666 --> 00:09:02.793
You think maybe you should. I don't know.

244
00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.920
work on your thesis this week?

245
00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:07.130
'Cause your paper will not write itself.

246
00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:08.548
-Hey. look. it's a break.
-I'm just saying.

247
00:09:08.632 --> 00:09:10.259
-It's a break. Kunle.
-I'm just saying.

248
00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:11.468
Spring break. "Break."

249
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.844
That's what it means. all right?

250
00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:15.555
I got like three weeks
till it's due anyway. so...

251
00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:17.641
I'm good.

252
00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:20.143
Okay. but...

253
00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:23.021
Yeah. I'm doing it.
No. I'm saying it. Look.

254
00:09:23.105 --> 00:09:24.690
Three weeks is nothing.

255
00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.817
If we can't get into all seven parties.

256
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.443
it's not the end of the world.

257
00:09:28.527 --> 00:09:29.778
but it will be the end of the world

258
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.196
if you do not graduate.

259
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.990
Okay. do not downplay what the fuck

260
00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:34.533
we doing tonight. all right?

261
00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:36.076
We are making history.

262
00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.953
-Get your priorities straight. Kunle.
--My pri...

263
00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.705
-Okay. All right. all right.
-Get your priorities straight.

264
00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.456
All right.

265
00:09:42.708 --> 00:09:44.293
What is this?

266
00:09:46.837 --> 00:09:48.422
Oh. Jesus.

267
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.549
-Wh-What is this?
-It's death punch.

268
00:09:50.632 --> 00:09:53.135
We got to get a buzz. bitch.
We on a schedule. all right?

269
00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:55.095
I'm gonna be back.
Hurry up with all this shit.

270
00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:56.596
And finish that little bottle.

271
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.765
-"Little bottle"?
-Finish it!

272
00:09:58.849 --> 00:10:01.310
There's. like. a whole lot in here.

273
00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.689
I am not drinking that.

274
00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:11.111
Here you are. bruh.

275
00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:13.322
Yes. yes. Thank you.
I really fucking owe you one.

276
00:10:13.405 --> 00:10:15.407
Yeah. yeah. of course you do.
You actually got lucky.

277
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.242
I was about to give those
to a cute freshman chick.

278
00:10:17.326 --> 00:10:18.744
Oh. my bad.

279
00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:20.746
Bruh. we were getting attached.
and then she want to say.

280
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:22.247
"Oh. look. I got a boyfriend."

281
00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:23.874
And it's just. are you serious?

282
00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.876
Like. I'm getting emotional.
I'm an emotional person.

283
00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.502
But. I mean. I don't care at this point

284
00:10:27.586 --> 00:10:29.629
because I can just do my own thing

285
00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:31.214
until. you know. she's done with her man.

286
00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:32.924
-- Mm-hmm. Word. word.
-- but your future ex.

287
00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:34.676
-All right. I'll see you tonight.
-Yeah. yeah. but...

288
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.303
-Yeah. so... Yeah.
-Thank you again.

289
00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:37.721
Hey. Asa. Asa. hey.

290
00:10:38.764 --> 00:10:40.182
Wait. where you gonna be tonight?

291
00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:42.434
-Equinox and Underground.
-Yeah?

292
00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:44.102
Okay. well. me and Kunle. too.

293
00:10:44.186 --> 00:10:46.563
We're finally gonna finish
our Legendary Tour. thanks.

294
00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.357
-Mm. for real?
-Mm-hmm.

295
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.817
Sounds intense and possibly ill-advised.

296
00:10:50.901 --> 00:10:53.111
Well. "intense and possibly ill-advised"

297
00:10:53.195 --> 00:10:56.740
is the tagline for our night.
so that works for me.

298
00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.160
Well. as your friend. I just
want to say for the record

299
00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:02.204
maybe you should take it easy.

300
00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:06.333
I can't. because
we're making history. but...

301
00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.418
No. I'm serious. though.

302
00:11:08.502 --> 00:11:10.170
You don't...
You didn't have to do all that.

303
00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:11.880
Look. you're gonna do
what you're gonna do.

304
00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:14.299
Just don't be dragging Kunle
into some bullshit.

305
00:11:14.383 --> 00:11:16.301
That boy is Black excellence.

306
00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:18.428
and there's still hope for him.

307
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.723
Bye. Sean.

308
00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:27.396
Your anti sent you a package.

309
00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:28.647
Did you get it?

310
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.358
- Oh. oh. I. uh...
I-I haven't been home yet.

311
00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.568
MAMA
Remember to call her and say thank you.

312
00:11:33.652 --> 00:11:36.154
I told her you got into Princeton

313
00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:38.198
and you'll be doing your PhD there.

314
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.200
Now she is telling everyone
you're going to be a doctor.

315
00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:42.994
I didn't have the heart to tell her

316
00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:46.164
-it's not that kind of doctor.
-Ah.

317
00:11:46.248 --> 00:11:50.001
Well. uh. technically.
I still will be a doctor.

318
00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:51.711
just not of medicine.

319
00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:53.713
It's not too late to go to med school.

320
00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:55.841
-Mama. Mama. -You would be
a wonderful cardiologist.

321
00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.050
-- Boom. bitch!

322
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.764
-You ready to fucking party?

323
00:12:02.848 --> 00:12:03.765
-- Party?
-Oh.

324
00:12:03.849 --> 00:12:05.308
Kunle. what party?

325
00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:06.601
-Oh. shit.
-- No. it's not a party.

326
00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:08.603
No. it's not a party. It's just Sean and I

327
00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:10.188
hanging out with some friends tonight.

328
00:12:10.272 --> 00:12:11.815
Why are you going to a party?

329
00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:13.358
You should be working on your thesis.

330
00:12:13.442 --> 00:12:15.402
I'm-I'm working on it.

331
00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:19.281
I am literally in the lab
working on it right-right now.

332
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.283
I don't like that Sean boy.

333
00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.160
He is a bad influence.

334
00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:24.870
Undisciplined.

335
00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:27.247
On his Instagram. he's always vaping.

336
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.499
Tell him that vaping
is bad for his health.

337
00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:31.501
You don't vape. do you?

338
00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:33.795
No. It's bad for you.

339
00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:35.380
Oh. I have a patient.

340
00:12:35.464 --> 00:12:37.632
I have to go. Remember to call Anti.

341
00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:39.551
Okay. Okay. Bye. Mom.

342
00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.428
Eh-huh.

343
00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:44.264
Sean! My mom told me to tell you

344

Any questions?

414
00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:45.945

an extra pass for Carlos?

Kunle. no.

416
00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:51.117
I did not get an extra pass
for Carlos. bro.

417
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:53.453
It was already hard enough
to get two passes.

418
00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:56.748
I'm not wasting a fucking favor
on Winnie-the-Pooh. all right?

What would he even be like if he went?

420
00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:00.335

421
00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:01.628

422
00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.380
He gonna insist on wearing
that fucking fanny pack.

423
00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.924
But it's his thing.
This is... it's his attire.

424
00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:08.760
He'd probably scare off every woman
within like a hundred-mile radius

425
00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:10.428
by offering 'em a fucking granola bar.

426
00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:12.514
I don't have time
for that type of stuff. okay?

427
00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.724
He's been playing video games
since his class yesterday.

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.377
Go see. Go check. Go do whatever.

520
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:12.837
-Okay. Come on.

521
00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:14.881
Me and you. me and you.
me and you. me and you.

522
00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:17.342
I'm-I'm right behind you.
Right behind you.

523
00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:25.642
-You're right behind me?
-Motherfucker. just go!

524
00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:27.518
Los?

525
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.826
Okay.

526
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.453
Hey.

527
00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:46.788
Carlos?

528
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.084
-Hey. Hey. hey.

529
00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:52.585
Jesus.

530
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:54.003
-You got me.
-Right.

531
00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:55.672
I'm-I'm presently at war with the Russians

532
00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:58.007
-and the Persian Empire.
so shit is about to get… -Okay.

533
00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:00.218
Okay. but do you know the girl out here?

534
00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:02.345
Hold on a second. Wait.

535
00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:03.596
Look.

536
00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.932
-Hey. hey.
-This is a single-player game.

537
00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:07.767
-You can pause.
-Mess up my sensitivity.

538
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.519
Now. there's a girl on...

539
00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.397
Ah. girl problems. huh?

540
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.357
What. is it Bianca? Is it someone I know?

541
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.150
What-what's going on?

542
00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:17.944
Ew.

543
00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:20.279
There is an unconscious
white girl in our living room.

544
00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:25.201
What?

545
00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:26.911
-- Hey. hey. Kunle!

546
00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:28.454
Kunle. Kunle. she's throwing up!

547
00:21:28.538 --> 00:21:29.956
Oh. hey. hey. Kunle!

548
00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:31.499
Kunle. she erupting.

549
00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:33.251
She throwing. bro. She throwing up.

550
00:21:35.878 --> 00:21:36.963
Who-who is she?

551
00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:39.007
We-we don't know.

552
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.383
Where's Maddy?

553
00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:42.760
Hey. Hey. hey. What'd you say?

554
00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:44.804
What-what... what did you say?

555
00:21:44.887 --> 00:21:46.347
Can you go tell her I feel really weird?

556
00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:47.807
Ooh. no. no. Come on. come on. come on.

557
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:49.058
Hey. stop touching.

558
00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:51.144
-Stop touching.
-No. I cannot stop touching.

559
00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:52.812
Look. we have to keep her on her side.

560
00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:55.189
All right? Or else she could
inhale vomit and die.

561
00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:57.817
Look. just trust me.
I'm first aid certified.

562
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.402
That's... Okay.

563
00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:01.696
Hey. what's your name?

564
00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:03.322
What's your...

565
00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:06.617
Okay. All right. um...

566
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.454
We should call 911. right?

567
00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:11.205
-Yes...
-No. no. Hey. stop. -Yes.

568
00:22:11.289 --> 00:22:13.124
-What? What?
-Stop. Are you fucking crazy?

569
00:22:13.207 --> 00:22:14.625
Do you not know what they'll think

570
00:22:14.709 --> 00:22:15.877
when they come and see this?

571
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.462
They're gonna shoot us and arrest us

572
00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:18.796
for killing this little white girl.

573
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.840
Shoot us and arrest us?

574
00:22:20.923 --> 00:22:22.383
-Yes.
-Come on. man.

575
00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:24.552
-We didn't do anything wrong.
-Hey. hey. stop. stop. stop.

576
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:26.679
-Okay. listen.

577
00:22:26.763 --> 00:22:27.889
What the fuck are you...

578
00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:29.932
We don't have to do nothing wrong. Kunle.

579
00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:32.268
Just be in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

580
00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:33.519
Which we are!

581
00:22:33.603 --> 00:22:34.812
Down white girl.

582
00:22:34.896 --> 00:22:36.522
House that reeks of weed.

583
00:22:36.606 --> 00:22:40.026
Your fingerprints and DNA
are all over her. Touchy Tim.

584
00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:41.903
And. Carlos. you were here
the whole fucking time.

585
00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:43.321
What's your alibi. huh?

586
00:22:43.404 --> 00:22:44.906
Uh...

587
00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:47.867
Guys. we're just gonna tell 'em
we came home...

588
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.619
-Kunle. Hey. hey. hey. hey.
-She was on the floor.

589
00:22:49.702 --> 00:22:51.370
They not gonna listen. all right?

590
00:22:51.454 --> 00:22:53.581
The cops don't know that you're
basically white on the inside.

591
00:22:53.664 --> 00:22:55.083
-Don't start that right now...
-What? I'm being honest.

592
00:22:55.166 --> 00:22:56.959
Bitch. that's honest information.
Don't get mad.

593
00:22:57.043 --> 00:22:58.669
They're not gonna listen.

594
00:22:58.753 --> 00:23:00.588
They're just gonna come in here
and see three Brown guys

595
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:02.757
hanging over this little white girl.

596
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.801
Do y'all not see how fucked that is?

597
00:23:08.304 --> 00:23:10.306
♪ ♪

598
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:30.493
Perhaps we could persuade a friend

599
00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:32.870
to call 911 for us.

600
00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:37.708
Someone a-a little less. um... you know.

601
00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:39.293
What. Brown?

602
00:23:39.377 --> 00:23:40.711
So a white person.

603
00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:43.840
A female would be preferable.

604
00:23:44.882 --> 00:23:47.677
Um. we could... we could call Bianca.

605
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.680
I mean. she cool.
but she don't know all of us that well.

606
00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:52.014
Okay. who knows us?

607
00:23:52.098 --> 00:23:53.975
Um... Asa.

608
00:23:54.058 --> 00:23:57.979
I would rather not put my life
in the hands of my ex.

609
00:23:58.062 --> 00:24:00.731
Plus. she a Black queen.
We need a white girl.

610
00:24:00.815 --> 00:24:02.608
Um...

611
00:24:02.692 --> 00:24:04.277
It's funny. I-I-I...

612
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.737
I don't know too many
of my white female peers.

613
00:24:06.821 --> 00:24:08.281
It's troubling.

614
00:24:08.364 --> 00:24:09.991
Um...

615
00:24:10.074 --> 00:24:11.534
Oh. oh. we-we could call

616
00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:13.703
-White Sean. the football player.
-Ooh...

617
00:24:13.786 --> 00:24:15.413
Football players never get
in trouble. right?

618
00:24:15.496 --> 00:24:18.040
White Sean. White Sean.
Ooh. come on. White Sean.

619
00:24:18.124 --> 00:24:20.877
-Come on.

620
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.295
WHITE SEAN
Oh. what's up. Sean?

621
00:24:22.378 --> 00:24:23.921
Hey. hey. White Sean.

622
00:24:24.005 --> 00:24:26.090
-Where are you?
-Uh. I'm actually on

623
00:24:26.174 --> 00:24:28.509
a microbrewery tour with my mom.

624
00:24:28.593 --> 00:24:30.887
-So you're not on campus?
-Nah.

625
00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.972
-Fuck. -You know. you know. man.
I didn't think I'd like this...

626
00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:35.808
Um. okay. Yeah. yeah. yeah.
Hey. got to go.

627
00:24:35.892 --> 00:24:38.769
Okay. who else can we call?
Come on. come on. come on.

628
00:24:38.853 --> 00:24:40.563
Brian Phan?

629
00:24:40.646 --> 00:24:41.856
Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah. Yeah.

630
00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:43.816
Asians-- they. like.
fucking neutral to police.

631
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.153
No. Brian is in Cabo for break.

632
00:24:47.236 --> 00:24:48.946
- Oh. fuck. y'all.
we are one percent of the school.

633
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.324
How the fuck don't we know
any white people?

634
00:24:51.407 --> 00:24:53.910
Maybe we just overthinking right now.

635
00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:59.916
Hey. Hey. yo!

636
00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:01.209
Yeah. there she go.

637
00:25:01.292 --> 00:25:04.712
Hey. You got anybody
that you want us to call?

638
00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:07.340
-Or. like. a-a friend or a phone
or something? -

639
00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:09.258
She cannot be on her back.

640
00:25:09.342 --> 00:25:10.718
-Okay. okay. all right. all right.
-- The touching.

641
00:25:10.801 --> 00:25:12.637
-It's the touching.
-- Come on. come on.

642
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.013
Okay. so what do we know? What do we know?
What do we know?

643
00:25:14.096 --> 00:25:17.433
This girl got drunk
and came here on accident.

644
00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:18.935
Like Goldilocks.

645
00:25:19.018 --> 00:25:20.853
And we're the three bears.

646
00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:23.397
Please don't. Please don't.

647
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:25.608
Let's... leave it alone. Leave it alone.

648
00:25:25.691 --> 00:25:27.777
Don't-don't...

649
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.570
All right. and look at what she's wearing.

650
00:25:29.654 --> 00:25:30.988
Anything but clothes.

651
00:25:31.072 --> 00:25:32.907
She was at Omicron.

652
00:25:33.991 --> 00:25:35.785
We could just take her ass back.

653
00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:37.328
And do what?

654
00:25:38.329 --> 00:25:40.081
What. just-just walk in with her?

655
00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:41.415
No. not walk in with her.

656
00:25:41.499 --> 00:25:43.709
Lay her outside where somebody
can find her and help her.

657
00:25:43.793 --> 00:25:46.837
Your plan is to dump the unconscious girl

658
00:25:46.921 --> 00:25:49.257
outside of the frat party?

659
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.508
Yeah.

660
00:25:53.844 --> 00:25:56.389
No. no. No. you right.

661
00:25:56.472 --> 00:25:58.474
-Nah. It's not...
-Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

662
00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:00.851
-Somebody... Yeah. somebody...
People could see us. -Yeah.

663
00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:02.395
Draw conclusions. all that bad shit.

664
00:26:02.478 --> 00:26:03.854
Drunk people. lots of eyes.

665
00:26:03.938 --> 00:26:06.148
-- Yeah.
-- That's difficult.

666
00:26:06.232 --> 00:26:09.944
Also. fellas. she's fucking unconscious.

667
00:26:10.027 --> 00:26:11.445
We can't just leave her somewhere.

668
00:26:11.529 --> 00:26:13.114
-Right? Right?
-- Okay. Okay. Okay. -- Right.

669
00:26:13.197 --> 00:26:14.824
What the fuck is wrong with you two?

670
00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:16.033
What. you got a better idea?

671
00:26:16.117 --> 00:26:18.369
Yes. We call 911.

672
00:26:18.452 --> 00:26:20.204
Or we could just let her sleep it off.

673
00:26:20.288 --> 00:26:21.789
Okay? I've been this drunk before.

674
00:26:21.872 --> 00:26:23.708
-Y'all know that shit.
-Yeah. He always wakes up.

675
00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:25.626
- Come on.
you know I've been this drunk before.

676
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.295
We don't even know if she's drunk.

677
00:26:27.378 --> 00:26:29.088
What if she's. like. roofied?

678
00:26:31.465 --> 00:26:33.092
Why'd you have to come here. huh?

679
00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:34.802
Why'd you have to come here?

680
00:26:34.885 --> 00:26:36.679
'Cause it was just right.

681
00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:38.389
It's not hot. it's not too cold.

682
00:26:38.472 --> 00:26:41.017
It was just right.

683
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.601
Sorry. I'm sorry.

684
00:26:42.685 --> 00:26:43.936
Fuck this. Fuck this.

685
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.271
This not my problem.

686
00:26:45.354 --> 00:26:47.231
What the fuck?
I mean. this not our problem.

687
00:26:47.315 --> 00:26:48.524
This is our problem.

688
00:26:48.607 --> 00:26:50.109
She is already in our house.

689
00:26:50.192 --> 00:26:52.111
-Yeah. because you don't know
how to lock the door. Carlos. -What?

690
00:26:52.194 --> 00:26:54.447
-We've talked about this shit.
-Okay. All right. all right. look. look.

691
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.032
Why wouldn't you just let me call 911?

692
00:26:56.115 --> 00:26:57.325
Now w-we've waited too long.

693
00:26:57.408 --> 00:26:58.868
it's gonna look weird
that we haven't called.

694
00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:00.953
Well. then it's a good thing
that we're not calling. Kunle.

695
00:27:01.037 --> 00:27:02.330
We got to do something.

696
00:27:02.413 --> 00:27:03.789
-Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

697
00:27:03.873 --> 00:27:04.999
Oh. shit.

698
00:27:05.082 --> 00:27:06.208
-Okay. hey.

699
00:27:06.292 --> 00:27:07.293
-- Fuck this.
-- All right.

700
00:27:07.376 --> 00:27:08.919
I'm-I'm doing it. I'm calling 911.

701
00:27:09.003 --> 00:27:10.921
-- Don't. Kunle. do not call 911.
all right? -Wait. wait. wait. wait...

702
00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:12.465
-Call 911. right? I'm gonna do it. I'm
gonna do it. -Don't do it. Don't grab it.

703
00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:14.133
-Ah. you nasty bitch.

704
00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:16.302
-You nasty.
-- All right.

705
00:27:16.385 --> 00:27:18.054
- That's…
You should've just left it there.

706
00:27:18.137 --> 00:27:19.889
-Just leave it there.
-- Ew. Ew.

707
00:27:19.972 --> 00:27:22.141
-We all use that blanket.
-- Kunle. Kunle. look.

708
00:27:22.224 --> 00:27:23.684
-Hey. look. I'm so serious.
-I'm calling 911.

709
00:27:23.768 --> 00:27:25.561
-Sean. Sean.
-Do not... Shut up. Shut up.

710
00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:27.355
-Get the fuck off of me. Sean!
-Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

711
00:27:27.438 --> 00:27:28.939
-I'm serious.
-Make me. Shut up.

712
00:27:29.023 --> 00:27:31.275
-Get off of me.
-No.

713
00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:33.402
-Put the phone down. Kunle.
-Los?

714
00:27:33.486 --> 00:27:35.279
Lower the phone.

715
00:27:35.363 --> 00:27:38.324
What if... what if...

716
00:27:38.407 --> 00:27:40.409
we take her to the hospital?

717
00:27:41.619 --> 00:27:44.538
All right? Just say that we found her.

718
00:27:44.622 --> 00:27:45.790
It's the truth.

719
00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:46.999
That's actually not a bad idea.

720
00:27:47.083 --> 00:27:49.335
I apologize for getting in your circle.

721
00:27:49.418 --> 00:27:51.087
Hospital's not too far.

722
00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.671
It's like. what. ten minutes?

723
00:27:52.755 --> 00:27:54.840
This will take us thir...
a half hour. tops.

724
00:27:54.924 --> 00:27:57.510
Um. I still need to get back
to the lab. but I think

725
00:27:57.593 --> 00:28:00.137
that we'll have enough time
to make it to Blackout.

726
00:28:00.221 --> 00:28:01.931
-- Wait. Blackout?
-Fu...

727
00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:04.266

Right. Right. so. uh...

We don't want to give 'em
a reason to stop us.

who are you looking for?

-I'll drive.

840
00:32:45.631 --> 00:32:47.174
-I'll drive because you're high as a kite.
-All right. Okay.

841
00:32:47.257 --> 00:32:48.842
-- Or high as a giraffe's ass.
as you say. -- Okay. okay. okay.

843

844

845
00:32:53.764 --> 00:32:54.848
Just pull...

846
00:32:54.932 --> 00:32:56.934
All right. okay. okay. Goddamn.

847
00:32:57.017 --> 00:32:59.478

fucking thing out of nothing.

848
00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:09.321
This is Omicron. right?

849
00:33:09.405 --> 00:33:12.533
Which is. if I may point out.

850
00:33:12.616 --> 00:33:15.619
much closer than the hospital.

851
00:33:15.703 --> 00:33:17.079

00:33:38.308 --> 00:33:39.893
No. we're not just going to dump her

864
00:33:39.977 --> 00:33:42.104
somewhere that's...
Look. that's not right.

865
00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:44.064
It's-it's... We're not dumping her. okay?

866
00:33:44.148 --> 00:33:46.191
We're just returning her
from whence she came.

867
00:33:46.275 --> 00:33:47.860
That's it.

868
00:33:47.943 --> 00:33:49.987
Somebody gonna find her.
get her some help.

869
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.197
Then we can leave. go save your little

870
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:54.491
fucking babies or whatever
the fuck you want to call them.

871
00:33:54.575 --> 00:33:56.785
and then get on with our lives. Kunle.

872
00:33:59.246 --> 00:34:00.789
Okay.

873
00:34:00.873 --> 00:34:02.207
-Stealth mission is a go.
-Okay.

874
00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:03.959
One of us has to go over there

875
00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:06.003
and-and act like a lookout.

876
00:34:06.086 --> 00:34:07.838
make sure that no one interferes
with the plan.

877
00:34:07.921 --> 00:34:10.132
Mm. yeah. Kunle. go see if it's clear.

878
00:34:29.443 --> 00:34:31.653
Okay. okay. Let-let's get in position.

879
00:34:31.737 --> 00:34:33.030
I see him. That's it.

880
00:34:33.113 --> 00:34:35.115
Omicron!

881
00:34:41.997 --> 00:34:43.457
Oh. oh. oh.

882
00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.501
-Abort. Abort. abort. abort. abort. abort.
-Shit. What the fuck?

883
00:34:46.752 --> 00:34:48.128
How's it going?

884
00:34:49.505 --> 00:34:51.089
Yes.

885
00:34:51.173 --> 00:34:52.424
Come on.

886
00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:56.970

I don't know if it was racism.

There was this... this dude...

915
00:35:50.107 --> 00:35:51.650

All right. all right. just...

918
00:35:54.903 --> 00:35:57.322
All right? Like Professor X.

919
00:35:57.406 --> 00:35:59.533
Great. Um...

920
00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:02.953
Want some orange sports drink?

921
00:36:03.036 --> 00:36:05.789
It has no fruit juice.
and it's only 80 calories.

922
00:36:05.873 --> 00:36:07.291
-Come on. drink up.

923
00:36:07.374 --> 00:36:08.542
Look. I told you that was a bad idea.

924
00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:10.127
We should've just gone
straight to the hospital.

925
00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:11.879
You know what. pull over. I'll drive.

926
00:36:11.962 --> 00:36:13.505
-There you go. -You don't even have
a fucking seat belt on!

927
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:15.841
-No. no. no. Hmm. -
-- Man. I never got a seat belt on!

928
00:36:15.924 --> 00:36:17.301
-Let's just get through this.
Calm down. -No. no.

929
00:36:17.384 --> 00:36:18.844
-Pull over. Sean. Pull over.
-Calm-calm the fuck down.

930
00:36:18.927 --> 00:36:20.971
What you gonna do?

931
00:36:22.139 --> 00:36:23.682
-Nothing. Exactly.
-Sean. pull over.

932
00:36:23.765 --> 00:36:26.018
Shut your dumb ass up.
You ain't gonna do nothing.

933
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:27.477
-- Sean.
-I need to pee.

934
00:36:27.561 --> 00:36:28.770
Pull over.

935
00:36:28.854 --> 00:36:31.565
-I should drive.
-Guys? Guys. uh...

936
00:36:31.648 --> 00:36:35.235
I believe Goldilocks needs to urinate.

937
00:36:36.278 --> 00:36:38.655
Um. she better not pee
in my motherfucking van.

938
00:36:38.739 --> 00:36:40.532
I don't know if she's gonna
be able to hold it. Maybe...

939
00:36:40.616 --> 00:36:43.660
-She better not pee in my car.
-Maybe you should pull over.

940
00:36:43.744 --> 00:36:45.871
I got it. I got it. Kunle.

941
00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:52.377
Get her out my van. Get her out my van.

942
00:36:55.255 --> 00:36:57.090
All right.

943
00:37:00.302 --> 00:37:01.428
Yeah.

944
00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:03.555
Uh. how about that?
You-you pee right here?

945
00:37:03.639 --> 00:37:05.641
-There you go.
-This is good.

946
00:37:08.018 --> 00:37:09.686
-We looked everywhere.
-No. Maddy.

947
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:10.979
we have not looked everywhere.

948
00:37:11.063 --> 00:37:12.689
And what are you gonna do.
call the cops right now?

949
00:37:12.773 --> 00:37:14.107
We are underage.

950
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:15.901
Does she have. like.
a Find My Friends or something?

951
00:37:15.984 --> 00:37:17.653
We can... we can track her on your phone.

952
00:37:17.736 --> 00:37:19.488
I don't know. I haven't tried that.

953
00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:22.491
There she is.

954
00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:25.494
Wait. That's literally like
a couple blocks from here.

955
00:37:25.577 --> 00:37:27.496
-What the fuck?
-Okay. okay. maybe she just got lost.

956
00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:28.997
so we can go get her.

957
00:37:29.081 --> 00:37:30.874
And I could go with you guys if you want.

958
00:37:30.958 --> 00:37:32.501
Oh. no. no. no. no.
You don't have to do that.

959
00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:35.420
Nah. nah. I mean. like. I-I want to.

960
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:39.675
Also. if you go a little further.

961
00:37:39.758 --> 00:37:42.970
this neighborhood's. like.
kind of sketchy.

962
00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.348
Hold this.

963
00:37:50.352 --> 00:37:52.062
I am so sorry.

964
00:37:52.145 --> 00:37:54.439
RAFAEL
It's all good.

965
00:37:57.192 --> 00:37:59.194
I'm so fucked.

966
00:38:00.988 --> 00:38:03.365
-I'm so fucked.
-Can't you just...

967
00:38:03.448 --> 00:38:04.366
grow more bacteria?

968
00:38:04.449 --> 00:38:05.909
No.

969
00:38:05.993 --> 00:38:08.245
No. no. I...

970
00:38:08.328 --> 00:38:10.288
I mean. you already got into Princeton.

971
00:38:10.372 --> 00:38:11.707
Can they un-admit you?

972
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.709
Yes. yes. they can.

973
00:38:13.792 --> 00:38:17.671
Hey. can you just. like.
not mention Princeton?

974
00:38:17.754 --> 00:38:20.173
Or just around Sean. please.

975
00:38:21.216 --> 00:38:23.343
Wait. I mean. you mean you haven't
already told him?

976
00:38:23.427 --> 00:38:24.636
-Okay. okay. okay. okay.
-I mean.

977
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.096
he-he thinks you're
living together next year.

978
00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:27.764
Okay. okay. well. maybe
he shouldn't just assume that.

979
00:38:27.848 --> 00:38:31.852
Yeah. yeah. but it's rather uncouth
to just let him go and keep assuming.

980
00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:37.107
KUNLE
No. you're right. you're right.

981
00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:05.510
-- Whoo. Yeah. you did it. Whoo. yes.

982
00:39:05.594 --> 00:39:08.638
-Whoa. Whoo.

983
00:39:08.722 --> 00:39:10.474
-- Come on.
-Can y'all please hurry up?

984
00:39:10.557 --> 00:39:12.768
-This fucking lady watching us.
-- What lady?

985
00:39:15.645 --> 00:39:17.397
Hmm-mm.

986
00:39:17.481 --> 00:39:18.607
Get up.

987
00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:20.150
-I'm driving.
-What?

988
00:39:20.233 --> 00:39:22.861
You're paranoid... because you're high.

989
00:39:22.944 --> 00:39:24.988
Which is exactly why
you shouldn't be driving.

990
00:39:25.072 --> 00:39:27.949
Okay. Whatever. Okay.

991
00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:29.659
I ain't gonna worry about anything. am I?

992
00:39:29.743 --> 00:39:31.369
SEAN
Yeah.

993
00:39:34.664 --> 00:39:37.125
Hey. um. the taillight's busted.

994
00:39:37.209 --> 00:39:38.710
What?

995
00:39:42.047 --> 00:39:44.174
-- We gonna die.
-- No. we are...

996
00:39:44.257 --> 00:39:45.509
-No. What?
-We gonna die. bro.

997
00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:47.094
-Hey. No. no. no. no.
-Oh. we gonna die tonight.

998
00:39:47.177 --> 00:39:48.637
Don't do this. Don't do this.
Please don't do this right...

999
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.763
We gonna die. We gonna die. Kunle.

1000
00:39:49.846 --> 00:39:51.098
We get pulled over. we die. Kunle.

1001
00:39:51.181 --> 00:39:53.058
-Look...
-We call the police. we die. Kunle.

1002
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:54.810
-Okay. look. Sean. Sean. Sean.
-We breathe the wrong way.

1003
00:39:54.893 --> 00:39:56.144
-we die. Kunle.
-Okay. look. Sean.

1004
00:39:56.228 --> 00:39:58.605
This isn't good.
but panicking does not help.

1005
00:39:58.688 --> 00:40:01.358
Calm down. Look. hey. man.
look at me. Look at me.

1006
00:40:01.441 --> 00:40:03.693
-Okay.
-Think about it statistically.

1007
00:40:03.777 --> 00:40:05.821
How many people actually
get shot by the cops?

1008
00:40:05.904 --> 00:40:08.657
It's. like. really.
really unlikely. right?

1009
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.575
-A lot. Kunle.
-No. no. no.

1010
00:40:10.659 --> 00:40:12.577
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-No. no. no. no. no.

1011
00:40:12.661 --> 00:40:14.204
No. it's really. really unlikely.

1012
00:40:14.287 --> 00:40:16.456
I mean. do you know anyone
who's actually been shot by the police?

1013
00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.542
-I don't know anybody. -- No.
-- Yes.

1014
00:40:18.625 --> 00:40:19.835
My cousin.

1015
00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:21.628
Geez. man. I'm sorry.

1016
00:40:21.711 --> 00:40:23.505
-Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't...
-Is he...?

1017
00:40:23.588 --> 00:40:25.507
He wasn't doing anything--
just minding his business.

1018
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.509
hanging with a friend.
playing Call of Duty.

1019
00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:30.428
And they just showed up
for-for... for no reason?

1020
00:40:31.471 --> 00:40:33.306
Well. his friend was trapping
a little bit.

1021
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:35.016
-His friend was trapping a little bit.
-God.

1022
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.810
The cops came in.

1023
00:40:36.893 --> 00:40:38.562
kicked the gor... door down.

1024
00:40:38.645 --> 00:40:42.357
I mean. they say he scared 'em.
and they shot him. all right?

1025
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.776
Shot him right in his ass. man.

1026
00:40:53.577 --> 00:40:55.954
- Oh. you motherfuckers
are some assholes.

1027
00:40:56.037 --> 00:40:58.165
That's not funny.

1028
00:40:58.248 --> 00:41:00.250
He got to wear a colostomy bag now.

1029
00:41:01.543 --> 00:41:03.837
-Oh.
-You ever boo-boo in a bag?

1030
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.505

00:56:34.475 --> 00:56:36.310
What?

1372
00:56:36.393 --> 00:56:38.395
You know. Alice has been
driving you around all night.

1373
00:56:38.479 --> 00:56:39.688
You could. I don't know.

1374
00:56:39.772 --> 00:56:41.023
-be grateful.
-Rafael. it's all right.

1375
00:56:41.107 --> 00:56:42.733
-Excuse me?
-No. no. no. No. you're awesome.

1376
00:56:42.817 --> 00:56:44.068
-First of all. no.
-And you're cool.

1377
00:56:44.151 --> 00:56:45.694
-You don't even know me.
-And you deserve better than this.

1378
00:56:45.778 --> 00:56:47.947
-Yeah. she's great. Are you for real?
-I'm just saying.

1379
00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:49.323
You don't even fucking know me.

1380
00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:50.783
You don't get to be all white knight

1381
00:56:50.866 --> 00:56:52.451
-and be offended on her behalf.
-Oh. "white knight." yeah.

1382
00:56:52.535 --> 00:56:54.829
I'm freaking out
because my sister has been taken

1383
00:56:54.912 --> 00:56:57.331
and that 911 lady was a total bitch to me
on the phone.

1384
00:56:57.414 --> 00:56:59.083
But you know. you know.
you could just not be actively mean.

1385
00:56:59.166 --> 00:57:01.001
-I'm sorry! I'm having a hard night!
-We're here. all right?

1386
00:57:01.085 --> 00:57:02.336
And we're here for you. Maddy.

1387
00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:03.712
We're fucking here.

1388
00:57:03.796 --> 00:57:05.756
You brought a high schooler
to a fraternity party

1389
00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.174
and then neglected her for two hours.

1390
00:57:07.258 --> 00:57:08.425
We're fucking here.

1391
00:57:08.509 --> 00:57:10.177
So get on the goddamn bike.
and we're going.

1392
00:57:13.889 --> 00:57:15.182
I think you should get on the bike.

1393
00:57:15.266 --> 00:57:16.725
Yeah. I'm getting on the bike.

1394
00:57:20.312 --> 00:57:21.480
Ow.

1395
00:57:24.692 --> 00:57:26.986
Trail ends here.

1396
00:57:28.028 --> 00:57:31.157
All right. shit. it must mean
she around here somewhere.

1397
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.200
Uh. or...

1398
00:57:33.284 --> 00:57:35.119
she backtracked.

1399
00:57:35.202 --> 00:57:37.329
Or-or maybe--

1400
00:57:37.413 --> 00:57:39.415
no offense-- you're in no way qualified

1401
00:57:39.498 --> 00:57:40.875
to track people through the woods.

1402
00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:42.334
-I'm an Eagle Scout.
-Okay.

1403
00:57:42.418 --> 00:57:43.919
I was trained in tracking animals.

1404
00:57:44.003 --> 00:57:45.713
Okay. but this isn't Boy Scouts.
all right?

1405
00:57:45.796 --> 00:57:48.549
-It's not... -This isn't a video game.
This is real life.

1406
00:57:48.632 --> 00:57:52.887
And we... we can't just reload
if you're wrong. Carlos.

1407
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:54.305
And I'm sorry. but I don't see anything.

1408
00:57:54.388 --> 00:57:55.639
Do you see anything?

1409
00:57:55.723 --> 00:57:57.892
Sean. you see anything?
Uh. no. there's nothing.

1410
00:57:57.975 --> 00:57:59.351
All right. I'm...

1411
00:57:59.435 --> 00:58:01.395
-- Just breathe. my nigga. Damn.

1412
00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:03.522
-- Okay.
-What if she dies out here?

1413
00:58:03.606 --> 00:58:05.649
Huh? Why did I listen to you?

1414
00:58:05.733 --> 00:58:07.943
This is so fucking stupid.

1415
00:58:08.027 --> 00:58:09.570
This is so stupid.

1416
00:58:09.653 --> 00:58:11.614
I told you we should just call 911.

1417
00:58:11.697 --> 00:58:12.865
but you wouldn't let me.

1418
00:58:12.948 --> 00:58:14.491
You just wouldn't let me call.

1419
00:58:14.575 --> 00:58:15.826
Now look at us.

1420
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:17.411
Wouldn't let you call?

1421
00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:19.663
What the fuck am I.
your third-grade teacher?

1422
00:58:19.747 --> 00:58:21.248
You decided not to call.

1423
00:58:21.332 --> 00:58:23.500
We all decided to not call.

1424
00:58:24.793 --> 00:58:27.213
He didn't force you not to call.

1425
00:58:27.296 --> 00:58:28.380
Seriously?

1426
00:58:28.464 --> 00:58:30.007
If you called. it would be on you.

1427
00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:32.760
and you didn't want it to be on you
because you knew I was right.

1428
00:58:32.843 --> 00:58:34.178
Also because you're a pussy.

1429
00:58:34.261 --> 00:58:35.763
-What?
-- I'm-I'm a pussy?

1430
00:58:35.846 --> 00:58:38.015
-Yeah.
-I'm a pussy. but you've been afraid

1431
00:58:38.098 --> 00:58:40.100
-of everything this whole night?
-CARLOS Guys. guys.

1432
00:58:40.184 --> 00:58:41.894
-I'm a pussy?
-Can we not call each other pussies?

1433
00:58:41.977 --> 00:58:43.646
It's kind of sexist.

1434
00:58:43.729 --> 00:58:45.981
A vagina is strong enough
to give birth to a child.

1435
00:58:46.065 --> 00:58:48.359
I mean. I think the word
that you're looking for

1436
00:58:48.442 --> 00:58:50.903
is-is "coward" or-or. ironically enough.

1437
00:58:50.986 --> 00:58:52.529
-"wiener."
-- Yeah.

1438
00:58:52.613 --> 00:58:56.116
Mm-hmm. Don't be such a sexist
coward wiener. Sean.

1439
00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.868
I can't believe you just said that

1440
00:58:57.952 --> 00:58:59.954
-out your mouth. first of all.
-Yeah. Sexist coward wiener.

1441
00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:02.206
-You. all of that. -Okay. well.
don't be such a little bitch. Kunle.

1442
00:59:02.289 --> 00:59:03.332
-I'm a bitch?
-Yeah.

1443
00:59:03.415 --> 00:59:04.708
-That's also arguably sexist.
-Okay. -Yeah.

1444
00:59:04.792 --> 00:59:05.793
Calm down.

1445
00:59:05.876 --> 00:59:07.169
-If you got something to say. just say it.
-Look. okay.

1446
00:59:07.253 --> 00:59:11.131
You were around real Black men
for like two fucking minutes tonight.

1447
00:59:11.215 --> 00:59:12.591
and you went and hid in the bathroom.

1448
00:59:12.675 --> 00:59:14.677
-Who was hiding? I was hiding?
-You! It's okay.

1449
00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:16.595
-I wasn't hiding. I wasn't hiding.
-I love you still.

1450
00:59:16.679 --> 00:59:18.222
-- Oh. wow.
-Okay. all right. no. we can do this.

1451
00:59:18.305 --> 00:59:19.682
What the fuck do you want me to say?

1452
00:59:19.765 --> 00:59:22.101
What. I'm so sorry
that my parents are doctors?

1453
00:59:22.184 --> 00:59:24.270
Oh. shit. you know what?
I'm even more sorry

1454
00:59:24.353 --> 00:59:26.272
-that my childhood was happy.
-Ow.

1455
00:59:26.355 --> 00:59:27.898
You know what?

1456
00:59:27.982 --> 00:59:31.026
You don't have the authority
to revoke my Blackness. dickhead.

1457
00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:32.528
Guys. can we... can we please just...

1458
00:59:32.611 --> 00:59:34.113
No. no. no. Let him continue.

1459
00:59:34.196 --> 00:59:35.739
-Kunle angry.
-You know what?

1460
00:59:35.823 --> 00:59:39.660
I think it is hilarious
that you think that you are so wise.

1461
00:59:39.743 --> 00:59:42.496
Like you got some kind of street smarts.
Why?

1462
00:59:42.579 --> 00:59:44.915
Oh. why. Sean?
Because you know where to buy acid?

1463
00:59:44.999 --> 00:59:46.834
Oh. shit! Oh. shit. Carlos.

1464
00:59:46.917 --> 00:59:48.752
Guess what.
This dude's tried drugs before.

1465
00:59:48.836 --> 00:59:50.504
-I know.
-- Whoo. yeah!

1466
00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:51.839
Round of applause. motherfucker.

1467
00:59:51.922 --> 00:59:53.173
You tried drugs.

1468
00:59:53.257 --> 00:59:54.341
But you know what?

1469
00:59:54.425 --> 00:59:55.843
Who the fuck cares?

1470
00:59:55.926 --> 00:59:57.678
You know what. Sean?

1471
00:59:57.761 --> 00:59:59.930
The last time I checked.
getting fucked-up all the time

1472
01:00:00.014 --> 01:00:01.932
doesn't mean you know a goddamn thing.

1473
01:00:02.016 --> 01:00:03.642
It just makes you fucked-up.

1474
01:00:07.146 --> 01:00:08.897
SEAN
Okay.

1475
01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:14.361
-I like this Kunle.
-Yeah. I'm glad you do.

1476
01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:15.946
This Kunle is nice.

1477
01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.823
-That's good. You showing nuts now.
-Fuck this.

1478
01:00:17.906 --> 01:00:19.867
Look. I feel like it's the first time
he ever used

1479
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:21.243
his Black skin tone type of thing.

1480
01:00:21.327 --> 01:00:22.870
-This is great. I like this.
-- You know what?

1481
01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:24.330
Nah. I'm sorry. that was just really good.

1482
01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:25.622
Look. just chill out. all right?
Chill out.

1483
01:00:25.706 --> 01:00:26.957
-No. I'm gonna... I'm call...
-Give me the fucking phone.

1484
01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:28.625
Carlos. give me your phone.

1485
01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:31.003
-Give me your phone.
-Just chill out. Carlos.

1486
01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:32.880
-Give it to me now!
-Come on.

1487
01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:34.590
-Don't give him your phone.
-Give it to me. Carlos.

1488
01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:35.799
Don't... Calm down.

1489
01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:37.259
We don't got time for this. Kunle.
Chill out.

1490
01:00:37.343 --> 01:00:39.261
-No. we lost her!
-The girl. we... Ooh.

1491
01:00:39.345 --> 01:00:42.431
We lost this girl in the fucking forest
because of you!

1492
01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:43.515
You!

1493
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.810
-Fuck!
-Ouch. Nice.

1494
01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:48.729
-Give me this fucking...
-Hey. hey. -Get your ass...

1495
01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:50.230
-- See?

1496
01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:51.357
-- Fuck! -- Kunle.
-Guys. guys.

1497
01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.733
-Can we please stop fighting?
-Asshole!

1498
01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.027
It doesn't accomplish anything.

1499
01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:57.071
-Come on.
-- All right. look.

1500
01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:59.031
Let's take it to a vote
since this dickhead right here

1501
01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:01.617
-wants to go all at. Right?
-Ow.

1502
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.579
All in favor of calling the police.
raise your hand.

1503
01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:08.791
Yeah. how you feel?

1504
01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:10.584
I feel so good.

1505
01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.669
I feel really good. Kunle.

1506
01:01:20.219 --> 01:01:22.888
Yeah. you're both cowards.

1507
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:25.516
SEAN
We're both cowards.

1508
01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:27.601
Get off of me. Carlos!

1509
01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.395
Don't be mad at him.

1510
01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:42.866
Found her.

1511
01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:46.078
How the fuck she get in a tree?

1512
01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:52.251
- Someday this will all just be
a crazy story. you know?

1513
01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:56.296
Remember when we tried
to sneak into Underground?

1514
01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.132
Freshman year.

1515
01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:02.344
Yeah. and you got stuck in the window

1516
01:02:02.428 --> 01:02:04.138
-like fucking Winnie-the-Pooh.
-Yeah. Yeah. yeah.

1517
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:05.806
That's what you said back then.

1518
01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:08.308
And-and. um.
then we went back to your room.

1519
01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:13.564
and we just watched 1970s Winnie-the-Pooh
compilation videos on YouTube.

1520
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:20.154
You know. I-I feel like that's the night
that we became friends.

1521
01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:23.699
Like. this is kind of our friend-versary.

1522
01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:25.701
We've come full circle.

1523
01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.870
So. we all just get to go to Underground.

1524
01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:29.371
Finally. right?

1525
01:02:29.455 --> 01:02:30.998
And-and just in time.

1526
01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:33.083
Because this is our last chance.

1527
01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.546
So you got to come. man.

1528
01:02:37.629 --> 01:02:40.132
Don't be a party pooper. Come on.

1529
01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:42.509
I'm tired.

1530
01:02:42.593 --> 01:02:44.761
But. y-you know. you should go.

1531
01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:49.558
Fuck him. L-Let him be a party pooper.

1532
01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:51.685
Come on. Kunle.

1533
01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.645
I can't go.

1534
01:02:53.729 --> 01:02:55.105
If I go. you can't go.

1535
01:02:55.189 --> 01:02:57.065
Because Sean only got two passes.

1536

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:03.139
Okay. well. if she's still breathing.

1700
01:09:03.223 --> 01:09:05.475
then that means
that her heart is still beating.

1701
01:09:05.559 --> 01:09:07.310
-Okay. I'm just trying to help.
-You're just trying to help?

1702
01:09:07.394 --> 01:09:09.729
-Yes. -Then why are we in the middle
of a fucking forest right now?

1703
01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.857
And why did you guys stop
at some weird house on the way here?

1704
01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:13.775
We were trying to avoid
getting pulled over.

1705
01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:15.318
We have a taillight that's out.

1706
01:09:15.402 --> 01:09:17.445
And we were trying to get another car
from his brother...

1707
01:09:17.529 --> 01:09:19.990
We know that this sounds weird. bad...

1708
01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:21.199
-- The taillight is out.
-Exactly.

1709
01:09:21.283 --> 01:09:22.576
-Thank you.
-- They're fucking lying.

1710
01:09:22.659 --> 01:09:24.870
What the fuck is your problem?

1711
01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:26.329
He just said the taillight was out.

1712
01:09:26.413 --> 01:09:28.748
Why are you so damn bent
on making us the bad guy?

1713
01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:30.500
And why the fuck was you so quick
to pepper-spray us?

1714
01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:32.586
Huh? What. 'cause we Black?

1715
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.296
-No! What?
-We scare you that much?

1716
01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:36.131
Maddy. what if there's a chance
that this is

1717
01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:37.966
just one big. weird misunderstanding?

1718
01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:39.676
I mean. it-it kind of tracks.

1719
01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:40.886

1720
01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:42.095

1721

No. Maddy. I'm not a fucking idiot.

1722
01:09:43.847 --> 01:09:45.557

to help. -Okay. um… Okay. excuse me.

1723
01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.725
-Don't touch her!
-Okay.

1724
01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:47.934
-Oh. God.

1726
01:09:49.394 --> 01:09:50.812

1727
01:09:50.896 --> 01:09:52.272
-I don't fucking know.
-Okay.

1728
01:09:52.355 --> 01:09:54.858
Well. she seems to be getting drunker
and-and-and...

1729
01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.818
I don't know. she threw up a lot earlier.

1730
01:09:56.902 --> 01:09:58.570
but I-I don't know
if that's gonna be enough.

1731
01:09:58.653 --> 01:09:59.988
She's gonna be okay. though. right?

1732
01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:01.948
She's not gonna. like. die. right?

1733
01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:03.950
Hey. when did you call 911?

1734
01:10:04.034 --> 01:10:05.452
Like ten minutes ago.

1735
01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:07.454
They're sort of having trouble
figuring out where we are.

1736
01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:10.081
Guys. she's getting colder.

1737
01:10:10.165 --> 01:10:11.791
Oh. Hey. we-we need...

01:28:46.363 --> 01:28:49.742
When I found out
that you was going to Princeton.

2038
01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:51.368

2039
01:28:51.452 --> 01:28:52.995
Wh-wh-what?

2040
01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:54.788
Wait. you knew I was going to Princeton?

2041
01:28:54.872 --> 01:28:56.248
Yeah.

2042
01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:59.585
Man. I knew before you did.

2043
01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:03.839
Saw that big-ass envelope in the mail.

2044
01:29:03.922 --> 01:29:05.632
I don't know. man. I just...

2045
01:29:05.716 --> 01:29:07.468
Look. everybody know

2046
01:29:07.551 --> 01:29:12.848
the Barack Obama
of fungus and bacteria and such.

2047
01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:15.434

2048
01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:18.062

You gonna change the world. bro.

2050
01:29:24.777 --> 01:29:28.363
Ten years from now. none of this shit
gonna mean nothing to you.

2051
01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:35.120
It just scared me. bro.

2052
01:29:35.204 --> 01:29:37.498
You wasn't gonna say nothing to me.

2053
01:29:37.581 --> 01:29:40.501
Just gonna leave and...

2054
01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:43.879
Just tried to do something. you know?

2055
01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:46.882
The-the Legendary Tour
would've worked. you know?

2056
01:29:46.965 --> 01:29:49.968
We could've been
on the Wall of Firsts. and...

2057
01:29:50.052 --> 01:29:51.970
I don't know. man.

2058
01:29:55.224 --> 01:29:59.394
Something to prove that. you know. uh.
I guess we both went here together.

2059
01:30:00.646 --> 01:30:02.731
And we was friends. you know?

2060
01:30:05.818 --> 01:30:08.195
Come on. Sean...

2061
01:30:08.278 --> 01:30:12.616
we are still going to be friends
when we graduate.

2062
01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:14.993
Yeah. yeah.

2063
01:30:15.077 --> 01:30:16.745
Yeah.

You're my best friend.

01:30:21.834 --> 01:30:23.669
You're my best friend. too.

2066
01:30:29.383 --> 01:30:31.552
And I really was going to tell you
about Princeton.

2067
01:30:31.635 --> 01:30:35.889
It's just. um... I was. I just...
I'm not even sure if I want to go.

2068
01:30:35.973 --> 01:30:37.516
-All right.
-I'm serious. I'm not...

2069
01:30:37.599 --> 01:30:39.351
Just because we're emotional
don't mean that we're stupid.

2070
01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:40.936
I'm just not sure I...

2071
01:30:41.019 --> 01:30:43.147
Look. it's Princeton.

2072
01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:45.149
You got to fucking go to Princeton.

2073
01:30:45.232 --> 01:30:47.860
You earned it. and you deserve it. Le.

2074
01:30:49.736 --> 01:30:52.781
Plus. I don't even got a job.
I could move closer to you.

2075
01:30:52.865 --> 01:30:54.616
Wait. where is... where is...

2076
01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:57.035
Where is. uh. Princeton?

2077
01:30:58.245 --> 01:30:59.997
It's in New Jersey.

2078
01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.166
-Oh. fuck. I-I...
-I know. I know.

2079
01:31:02.249 --> 01:31:03.458
I know. it's New Jersey. but...

2080
01:31:03.542 --> 01:31:04.918
-it's not that...
-Yeah. I-I should've thought first.

2081
01:31:05.002 --> 01:31:07.713
It's... Yeah. it's still Jersey.

2082
01:31:07.796 --> 01:31:09.381
But it's an hour away from Philly
and New York.

2083
01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:10.799
-so that's at least...

2084
01:31:10.883 --> 01:31:13.385
I would not drink that.

2085
01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:14.970
It's just water. Kunle. I'm thirsty.

2086
01:31:15.053 --> 01:31:16.847
It... Okay.

2087
01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:19.850
You know what. I think you can have
your own Wikipedia page. too.

2088
01:31:19.933 --> 01:31:21.602
-Mm.
-Yeah.

2089
01:31:21.685 --> 01:31:23.395
But finishing your thesis. graduating...

2090
01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:24.688
-Oh. shit.
-These are baby steps.

2091
01:31:24.771 --> 01:31:26.398
Like. we don't have to have
it all planned out

2092
01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:27.774
-if we can just take...
-Hey. hey. hey. hey.

2093
01:31:27.858 --> 01:31:31.403
-I can have... What?
-Hey. hey. hey. calm... calm.

2094
01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:33.322
No more lectures. all right?

2095
01:31:35.282 --> 01:31:37.034
Deal. No more lectures.

2096
01:31:37.117 --> 01:31:38.577

-Group hug!
-What? Oh. shit.

2101
01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:51.173
-Group hug is coming!
-It's okay.

2102
01:31:51.256 --> 01:31:52.633
-It's all right.

2103
01:31:52.716 --> 01:31:54.176
-Let me in. Let me in.
-Wait. wait.

2104
01:31:54.259 --> 01:31:56.178
You got to move your fanny pack
out the way.

2105
01:31:56.261 --> 01:31:58.222
-Hey. Oh. -So you can get in here

-It's good. -Yeah.

01:32:01.225 --> 01:32:02.684
-There you go.
-It's great.

2109
01:32:02.768 --> 01:32:04.519
-No. don't. don't. don't go up and down.
-Oh. don't-don't go up and down.

2110
01:32:04.603 --> 01:32:05.979
-Don't go up and down.
-That's a little too much.

2111
01:32:06.063 --> 01:32:08.065
-That's where it ends.

2112
01:32:18.450 --> 01:32:19.785
They're all okay.

2113
01:32:20.827 --> 01:32:22.746

you're having.

I wish there was a solution
to that problem.

2120
