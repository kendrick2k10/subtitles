3
00:01:54.017 --> 00:01:55.849
Rodrigo!

4
00:01:56.924 --> 00:01:59.585
We have a cease fire!

5
00:01:59.654 --> 00:02:02.422
Why did you kill my officers?

6
00:02:27.248 --> 00:02:28.882
Rodrigo.

7
00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.483
Rodrigo. drop your weapon!

8
00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:33.227
Down on your knees!

9
00:02:34.093 --> 00:02:35.625
Down on your knees!

10
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:53.204
Major. the rebels don't have
air support large enough

11
00:03:53.273 --> 00:03:55.276
to level an area this size.

12
00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.642
There's no smell of conventional
ordnance. no smell of petroleum.

13
00:04:00.711 --> 00:04:01.640
They must have access
to something

14
00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.175
we're not aware of yet.

15
00:04:03.244 --> 00:04:04.713
Then. respectfully. sir.
why don't we eliminate them

16
00:04:04.782 --> 00:04:06.353
before they destroy
a vital target?

17
00:04:06.422 --> 00:04:07.580
This is an international
peacekeeping mission.

18
00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:09.148
not a sanctioned war.

19
00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:10.919
The only reason your unit's
even here is to assist

20
00:04:10.988 --> 00:04:13.259
in the identification of these
unexplained demolitions.

21
00:04:13.328 --> 00:04:14.588
And. so far.
you've done a pretty

22
00:04:14.657 --> 00:04:15.894
piss poor job of it. Lieutenant.

23
00:04:20.863 --> 00:04:22.836
Since when does Brazil
get earthquakes?

24
00:04:22.905 --> 00:04:23.898
I don't know. sir.

25
00:04:26.804 --> 00:04:28.240
Could these tremors
be tied to something

26
00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.076
that's causing
this devastation?

27
00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:33.112
Some kind of induced seismicity?

28
00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:35.046
You mean like fracking. sir?

29
00:04:35.115 --> 00:04:36.777
Yeah. possibly that.

30
00:04:36.846 --> 00:04:38.880
But what would be
the cause of this?

31
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.753
That's what we're here
to find out for you. sir.

32
00:04:47.262 --> 00:04:49.661
Zeus. Scavenger.
Come in. Zeus.

33
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.326
We read you. Scavenger.
The general is inbound.

34
00:05:05.276 --> 00:05:06.873
General Norris.

35
00:05:06.942 --> 00:05:09.476
I have Scavenger
on the line. ma'am.

36
00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:11.616
What's your SITREP?

37
00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:13.418
We've yet to identify
a signature. ma'am.

38
00:05:13.487 --> 00:05:15.120
Seismic weaponry may
be a possibility

39
00:05:15.188 --> 00:05:16.788
regarding the tremors.

40
00:05:16.856 --> 00:05:19.391
But still doesn't account
for the source of demolitions.

41
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.462
Rule out any type
of seismic weaponry.

42
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.031
We're receiving reports
of global vulnerabilities

43
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.032
in kind. not just in Brazil.

44
00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:27.565
Did you say global. ma'am?

45
00:05:27.634 --> 00:05:29.129
-Is this a coordinated attack?

46
00:05:29.197 --> 00:05:31.838
Hold on. Scavenger.
Would you turn that thing off?

47
00:05:31.907 --> 00:05:33.265
Yes. General.

48
00:05:33.334 --> 00:05:36.372
Scavenger. we are not dealing
with weaponized systems.

49
00:05:36.441 --> 00:05:37.939
I don't understand. ma'am.

50
00:05:38.008 --> 00:05:39.813
We're seeing a variety
of natural disasters

51
00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:40.840
around the globe.

52
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.148
Earthquakes.
fires. floods.

53
00:05:44.217 --> 00:05:46.084
tornados. tsunamis.

54
00:05:46.153 --> 00:05:49.121
even locust swarms.

55
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.886
Locust swarms. General?

56
00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:56.096
Affirmative.

57
00:05:56.165 --> 00:05:57.696
You've been around the world.

58
00:05:57.764 --> 00:06:00.262
You've seen a few battlefields
in your day. as have I.

59
00:06:00.331 --> 00:06:02.069
Now you tell me.

60
00:06:02.138 --> 00:06:03.602
What does this look like to you?

61
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.140
Sounds like something out
of the book of Revelations.

62
00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:09.740
the end of the world. ma'am.

63
00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:11.709
The frequency and severity
of these disasters

64
00:06:11.778 --> 00:06:14.348
are increasing and
Cal-Tech has determined

65
00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:15.776
that they're originating
from a location

66
00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:19.314
near you at an
exponential rate.

67
00:06:19.383 --> 00:06:20.818
Say again. ma'am?

68
00:06:20.886 --> 00:06:24.286
These vulnerabilities
are occurring near you.

69
00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:25.788
Copy that. ma'am.

70
00:06:25.857 --> 00:06:29.027
You mention "geothermal"
as in volcanic?

71
00:06:29.096 --> 00:06:30.328
Affirmative.

72
00:06:30.397 --> 00:06:31.995
Now I need you to listen to me.

73
00:06:32.064 --> 00:06:34.197
Our priorities in Brazil have
changed effective immediately.

74
00:06:34.266 --> 00:06:35.801
Yes. ma'am.

75
00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:37.637
I'm assembling a team
of scientists who are experts

76
00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:41.407
in the field of volcanology.
meteorology and mycology.

77
00:06:41.476 --> 00:06:43.270
I'm dispatching them
to your location.

78
00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:44.604
And they will do everything
that they can within their power

79
00:06:44.673 --> 00:06:46.240
to stop this thing.

80
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:51.279
As of now. your new assignment
is to provide a security detail

81
00:06:51.348 --> 00:06:54.350
and assist the scientists in any
way that they deem necessary.

82
00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:55.615
Is that understood?

83
00:06:55.684 --> 00:06:57.184
Affirmative. ma'am.

84
00:06:57.253 --> 00:06:59.656
Expect the arrival of these
scientists within hours.

85
00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:02.461
As of right now. we have
a 12-hour window

86
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.891
before the eruption
that will end

87
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.891
life on this planet
as we know it.

88
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.496
And that timeframe is subject

89
00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:10.035
to change pending intel.

90
00:07:10.104 --> 00:07:11.163
Copy. Zeus.

91
00:07:11.232 --> 00:07:13.434
New orders received
and understood.

92
00:07:13.503 --> 00:07:16.169
Scavenger out.

93
00:07:21.645 --> 00:07:23.111
What do you got for me. Aidan?

94
00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:25.518
Okay. these are our top
candidates all within

95
00:07:25.587 --> 00:07:26.786
hour's travel time
to Brazil. General.

96
00:07:26.855 --> 00:07:28.016
Hm.

97
00:07:32.654 --> 00:07:34.189
Lynise Hughes.

98
00:07:34.257 --> 00:07:35.787
This is Colonel Nathan Hughes's
daughter. isn't it?

99
00:07:35.856 --> 00:07:37.563
Yes. it is. General.

100
00:07:37.632 --> 00:07:39.194
Actually. it's why
I pulled her file.

101
00:07:39.262 --> 00:07:41.193
Not only has she worked
directly with the military.

102
00:07:41.262 --> 00:07:43.998
she's also one of the
best I her field.

103
00:07:44.067 --> 00:07:46.705
-Outstanding.
-I try my best. ma'am.

104
00:08:06.392 --> 00:08:08.189
This is Lynise Hughes.

105
00:08:08.258 --> 00:08:10.929
Dr. Lynise Hughes. this
is General Brigitte Norris

106
00:08:10.998 --> 00:08:13.565
calling you from the United
States Army on a secured line.

107
00:08:13.634 --> 00:08:15.064
I'm a colleague of
your father's.

108
00:08:15.132 --> 00:08:17.603
Hello. General Norris.
I can't talk right now.

109
00:08:17.672 --> 00:08:18.799
I'm in the middle
of something important.

110
00:08:18.868 --> 00:08:20.165
I'm outside of Mexico City.

111
00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:21.736
We're experience
volcanic activity here

112
00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:23.502
like I've never seen before.

113
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:27.109
It's happening everywhere.
doctor. all across the globe.

114
00:08:27.178 --> 00:08:30.447
Every continent is experiencing
violent volcanoes.

115
00:08:30.516 --> 00:08:32.748
earthquakes and storms.

116
00:08:32.817 --> 00:08:34.148
Now we think that
we've pinpointed

117
00:08:34.216 --> 00:08:36.550
the epicenter of
these activities in Brazil.

118
00:08:36.619 --> 00:08:37.987
Wait. Brazil?

119
00:08:38.056 --> 00:08:40.352
But there shouldn't be
any volcanoes in Brazil.

120
00:08:40.421 --> 00:08:42.690
They're dormant.
They've been extinct forever.

121
00:08:42.758 --> 00:08:44.890
Not any more. doctor.

122
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.464
I want you on the ground.

123
00:08:47.532 --> 00:08:48.732
I need your expertise.

124
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:51.263
I want you to confirm it
is indeed Brazil

125
00:08:51.332 --> 00:08:53.233
as the source
of these disturbances.

126
00:08:53.302 --> 00:08:56.739
if we can stop it.
and how we can stop it.

127
00:08:56.808 --> 00:08:58.305
This is causing
a chain reaction

128
00:08:58.373 --> 00:09:00.541
of catastrophic
destruction around the world.

129
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.376
Okay. okay.

130
00:09:02.445 --> 00:09:04.684
I'll need a minute to get down.
I'm on top of a mountain.

131
00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:09.954
A helicopter is
already enroute to you.

132
00:09:10.022 --> 00:09:11.988
They'll initiate contact
with you on this frequency

133
00:09:12.057 --> 00:09:13.989
and instruct you where
to be for extraction.

134
00:09:14.058 --> 00:09:16.055
I'll also have a full.
up to date report

135
00:09:16.124 --> 00:09:18.059
for you to review
on your travels.

136
00:09:18.128 --> 00:09:20.931
Okay. General. I'll be waiting.
Out.

137
00:09:29.743 --> 00:09:31.938
Meteorologist
Dakota Lenna. ma'am.

138
00:09:32.007 --> 00:09:33.605
Magna Cum Laude from M.I.T.

139
00:09:33.674 --> 00:09:36.383
She's currently assigned to
INM working on cloud seeding

140
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:38.145
and weather patterns
in areas

141
00:09:38.214 --> 00:09:40.484
suffering from
wildfire devastation.

142
00:09:40.552 --> 00:09:42.051
Top of her game. General.

143
00:09:59.174 --> 00:10:00.339
Dakota! Dakota!

144
00:10:00.408 --> 00:10:01.340
-What?
-The Army!

145
00:10:01.409 --> 00:10:02.541
-What?
-The Army!

146
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.840
They want to talk
to you right now!

147
00:10:03.909 --> 00:10:05.005
-The Army?
-Get back in the truck.

148
00:10:05.073 --> 00:10:07.413
It sounds important.
Come on.

149
00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.408
Why's the Army on the phone?

150
00:10:13.215 --> 00:10:16.586
Elliott Rodney. two PhDs.
one in mycology.

151
00:10:16.654 --> 00:10:18.021
the other in ecology.

152
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.924
The reason I pulled his file
is he's worked

153
00:10:19.993 --> 00:10:22.388
with the DOD before
involving mycotoxins.

154
00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:25.197
Sounds good.
Call him up.

155
00:10:25.266 --> 00:10:26.700
Yes. ma'am.

156
00:11:24.353 --> 00:11:26.156
Dr. Hughes.
I'm Major Oakley Jones.

157
00:11:26.225 --> 00:11:29.627
This is Sergeant Shockley
and Lieutenant Rohrbacher.

158
00:11:29.696 --> 00:11:30.658
I'm glad you arrived safely.

159
00:11:30.727 --> 00:11:31.894
Thank you. Major.

160
00:11:31.963 --> 00:11:33.732
-Are you a man of faith?
-I am.

161
00:11:33.801 --> 00:11:35.363
Good. 'cause
we're gonna need it.

162
00:11:35.432 --> 00:11:37.766
We're expecting two more
scientists within the hour.

163
00:11:37.835 --> 00:11:39.168
So please come with me.

164
00:12:56.377 --> 00:12:58.050
Major. I meant
to ask you.

165
00:12:58.118 --> 00:13:00.452
I saw a lot of the country
burning on my flight in.

166
00:13:00.521 --> 00:13:01.621
Are they wildfires?

167
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.954
Yes. ma'am.
Wildfires too.

168
00:13:04.022 --> 00:13:05.085
And I read in the report
that we're

169
00:13:05.154 --> 00:13:06.491
in the middle of a civil war?

170
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.090
More of an uprising.

171
00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:10.227
Oh. so that's
the original mission

172
00:13:10.296 --> 00:13:12.129
that brought you down here.
fighting the rebels?

173
00:13:12.197 --> 00:13:15.197
Government tactical
assistance and guidance.

174
00:13:15.266 --> 00:13:16.695
But things have
changed drastically

175
00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:18.934
in the last 24 hours.
straining those efforts

176
00:13:19.003 --> 00:13:20.733
and altering our priorities.

177
00:13:20.802 --> 00:13:21.971
Clearly.

178
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.270
Did you have a
chance to examine

179
00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:25.310
General Norris's file
on the way over?

180
00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:26.405
I did.

181
00:13:26.474 --> 00:13:28.311
Assuming all of these
global disasters

182
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.776
can be traced to our current
events here in Brazil.

183
00:13:30.845 --> 00:13:35.352
what comes next is an eruption
that is orders of magnitude

184
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.722
more powerful than anything
we've ever seen before.

185
00:13:38.791 --> 00:13:40.652
To break it down Barney style.

186
00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:44.192
molten fire will rain
down on every continent.

187
00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:46.062
It'll be followed
by a nuclear winter

188
00:13:46.131 --> 00:13:48.598
and all life on
earth will perish.

189
00:13:55.938 --> 00:13:57.272
What was that?

190
00:13:57.341 --> 00:14:00.908
That's one of our
random phenomenon here.

191
00:14:00.977 --> 00:14:02.816
random explosions.

192
00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:04.380
Yet without the typical
acrid smell

193
00:14:04.448 --> 00:14:06.481
that accompanies bombs
and incendiary weapons.

194
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.089
We brought on a team from
the 71st Ordnance Group EOD

195
00:14:09.157 --> 00:14:11.819
to investigate. but so far
they've turned up nothing.

196
00:14:11.888 --> 00:14:13.452
You know what?

197
00:14:13.521 --> 00:14:15.588
I should take
an initial reading here.

198
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.802
Okay. there are inordinately
high levels

199
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:28.975
of ambient sulfur dioxide.

200
00:14:29.044 --> 00:14:30.070
It's being violently pushed
to the surface

201
00:14:30.138 --> 00:14:31.837
by the volcanic pressure.

202
00:14:31.906 --> 00:14:34.443
That's most likely what's caused
the unexplained explosions.

203
00:14:34.512 --> 00:14:36.713
Right. but would that cause
the levels of destruction

204
00:14:36.782 --> 00:14:38.082
we've been experiencing?

205
00:14:38.151 --> 00:14:40.283
With readings like this.
absolutely. Major.

206
00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:42.822
I mean. those gases
could literally vaporize

207
00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.451
anything they come
in contact with.

208
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.951
General Norris
set a 12-hour window?

209
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.688
If that.

210
00:14:48.756 --> 00:14:52.593
But how many hours.
I can't say at this point.

211
00:14:52.662 --> 00:14:54.761
I'm gonna need to run more
tests at the actual site.

212
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.499
And I need to locate the actual
epicenter of this disturbance.

213
00:15:00.003 --> 00:15:01.469
Think you can stop it?

214
00:15:02.803 --> 00:15:05.639
That last tremor felt
to me like magnitude six.

215
00:15:05.708 --> 00:15:08.606
And they're just going to
get more intense with time.

216
00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:13.118
And based on the readings
I just took.

217
00:15:13.187 --> 00:15:15.254
we're too far along
in the process to attempt

218
00:15:15.322 --> 00:15:18.157
any depressurization or
aperture venting techniques.

219
00:15:18.226 --> 00:15:23.293
So there's only one sure option
I can think of.

220
00:15:23.362 --> 00:15:25.326
How much ordnance can
you get on short notice?

221
00:15:25.395 --> 00:15:26.926
I'll get you whatever
you need. ma'am.

222
00:15:26.995 --> 00:15:28.901
Okay.

223
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.730
I need to locate
the epicenter first.

224
00:15:30.798 --> 00:15:34.607
Now we have a general
vicinity from Cal-Tech.

225
00:15:34.676 --> 00:15:36.401
this lake Lago Do Fodo.

226
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.244
But it's my company that has

227
00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:41.214
the best geothermal targeting
software in the world.

228
00:15:41.283 --> 00:15:44.349
And given that we're using
explosives on a grand scale.

229
00:15:44.418 --> 00:15:47.153
I'm gonna need to get as close
to the drop zone as possible.

230
00:15:47.222 --> 00:15:50.216
so that I can get a visual
reference on the actual

231
00:15:50.285 --> 00:15:51.818
location of the epicenter.

232
00:15:51.886 --> 00:15:53.821
We cannot afford to be off
by even as much as two meters.

233
00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.325
Copy.

234
00:15:55.394 --> 00:15:56.960
Let me grab my man
from EOD to provide you

235
00:15:57.029 --> 00:15:58.392
safe escort to Lago Do Fodo

236
00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:00.233
and if you
wouldn't mind standing

237
00:16:00.301 --> 00:16:02.398
in the command bunker over there
to wait. it'll be safe.

238
00:16:02.467 --> 00:16:04.867
Of course. Major.
but time is of the essence.

239
00:16:04.936 --> 00:16:06.167
Right away. ma'am.

240
00:16:06.236 --> 00:16:07.668
Based on what I've seen so far.

241
00:16:07.736 --> 00:16:09.337
I'm beginning to think
that we have a lot less

242
00:16:09.406 --> 00:16:10.971
than 12 hours
before the eruption.

243
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.276
Copy that. ma'am.

244
00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:32.961
We getting close?

245
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.298
Approaching now. doctor.

246
00:17:08.097 --> 00:17:09.731
Hey. Major?

247
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.166
How's your knowledge of recent
history in this part of Brazil?

248
00:17:12.235 --> 00:17:14.537
-Proficient.
-Okay.

249
00:17:14.606 --> 00:17:16.041
Well. volcanoes have
been extinct in this country

250
00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:18.310
for a very. very.
very long time.

251
00:17:18.379 --> 00:17:20.873
Now I know that industry
has decimated the rain forest.

252
00:17:20.942 --> 00:17:24.477
but is there fracking or
any other seismic explorations

253
00:17:24.546 --> 00:17:25.717
that you're aware
of in this part?

254
00:17:25.786 --> 00:17:27.419
Not that I know of.

255
00:17:27.488 --> 00:17:29.618
There have been reports of
large demolitions being used

256
00:17:29.687 --> 00:17:32.285
to clear foliage for
the pipelines out of Sergipe.

257
00:17:32.354 --> 00:17:33.591
Okay. that's good to know.

258
00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:38.163
All right. I'm getting extremely
high levels of C02.

259
00:17:38.232 --> 00:17:40.329
Now when C02 is detected
at the surface.

260
00:17:40.398 --> 00:17:42.130
it means that new magma
is running

261
00:17:42.198 --> 00:17:43.832
into the volcanic system.

262
00:17:43.901 --> 00:17:46.601
even though there isn't supposed
to be a volcanic system here.

263
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.374
Also. exorbitant levels
of sulfur dioxide.

264
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:52.338
which indicates that the
magma is close to the surface

265
00:17:52.406 --> 00:17:54.138
and eruption is definite.

266
00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:58.109
If these levels were any higher.
we wouldn't be able to breathe.

267
00:17:58.178 --> 00:18:02.083
Also. judging by the intensity
and the increasing intensity

268
00:18:02.152 --> 00:18:03.686
of the earthquakes.

269
00:18:03.754 --> 00:18:08.722
I would say that we are
well past the 12-hour mark.

270
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.722
Eruption's gonna happen
in a few hours.

271
00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:14.900
Now I can confirm
all the information

272
00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:16.634
in General Norris's report.

273
00:18:16.703 --> 00:18:21.273
This is the source of all of the
disturbances. this lake here.

274
00:18:21.342 --> 00:18:25.377
But without being able
to visually see the epicenter.

275
00:18:25.446 --> 00:18:28.909
I'm gonna need to link up
with my company's satellite

276
00:18:28.977 --> 00:18:32.449
and get an infrared image below
the surface of the water

277
00:18:32.518 --> 00:18:35.046
so that we can pinpoint
the exact location

278
00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.850
of the fissure if we have
any hope of stopping this.

279
00:18:45.096 --> 00:18:46.397
This shouldn't take long.

280
00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.213
What's the matter?

281
00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:06.615
I've lost the satellite link.

282
00:19:06.683 --> 00:19:08.153
I need that satellite link
if we're gonna

283
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:10.118
find the location
of the fissure!

284
00:19:10.187 --> 00:19:11.787
I have to have it!

285
00:19:11.856 --> 00:19:14.091
We can do a hard patch through
our server back at Foxtrot.

286
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.995
Okay.
Let's do that.

287
00:19:17.064 --> 00:19:18.059
Let's Oscar Mike. Lieutenant.

288
00:19:18.127 --> 00:19:20.799
Copy. sir.

289
00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:21.865
What is it. doctor?

290
00:19:21.934 --> 00:19:23.535
This fungus.

291
00:19:23.604 --> 00:19:25.702
I'm practically an expert of
flora around volcanic sites.

292
00:19:25.771 --> 00:19:28.270
And I've never seen anything
like this before in my life.

293
00:19:28.339 --> 00:19:30.473
When's your mycologist get here?

294
00:19:30.542 --> 00:19:32.879
They should have been
here an hour ago.

295
00:19:32.948 --> 00:19:33.876
All right. let's get going.

296
00:19:33.945 --> 00:19:34.980
Okay.

297
00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:35.977
Lieutenant. let's Oscar Mike.

298
00:19:36.046 --> 00:19:37.547
Yes. sir!

299
00:20:01.637 --> 00:20:02.974
You got enough room?
You good?

300
00:20:03.042 --> 00:20:04.209
-Yes.
-Sorry.

301
00:20:04.277 --> 00:20:05.774
Did they say what
the holdup was?

302
00:20:05.843 --> 00:20:07.178
Yeah. There was another storm
between the airfield

303
00:20:07.247 --> 00:20:08.544
-and the destination.
-Oh.

304
00:20:08.613 --> 00:20:09.975
Why didn't they just
circumnavigate it?

305
00:20:10.044 --> 00:20:11.847
Because I didn't want to
risk taking us through

306
00:20:11.916 --> 00:20:13.448
rebel-controlled territory.
get shot at and kidnapped.

307
00:20:13.516 --> 00:20:15.347
Right.
Let's not do that.

308
00:20:15.416 --> 00:20:17.690
Yeah. please?

309
00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:18.690
Go Brazil.

310
00:20:20.259 --> 00:20:22.559
Whoa!
Look at that!

311
00:20:26.865 --> 00:20:28.529
I have never seen lightning
like that before in my life!

312
00:20:28.597 --> 00:20:30.630
Oh. God!
I hope Onyx is okay.

313
00:20:30.699 --> 00:20:34.671
-Who's Onyx?
-Oh. he's my pup.

314
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.002
He's tough. but he does
not like thunderstorms.

315
00:20:37.071 --> 00:20:39.245
And I had to leave him
with my ex-girlfriend.

316
00:20:39.314 --> 00:20:41.112
I hate doing that.
I hate doing that.

317
00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:44.749
-Oh. I'm sorry.
-Thanks.

318
00:20:44.818 --> 00:20:47.111
So is he.

319
00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.348
Poor boy's probably
behind a couch shaking.

320
00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:51.654
Oh. I hate that.

321
00:20:57.158 --> 00:20:59.693
How many times are you gonna
read through that thing?

322
00:20:59.762 --> 00:21:01.631
-I'm a slow reader.
-I'm sorry.

323
00:21:04.366 --> 00:21:05.833
God. it is hot.

324
00:21:07.801 --> 00:21:09.502
It's 40 degrees Celsius outside.

325
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.003
You know the crazy thing?

326
00:21:11.072 --> 00:21:13.071
10 minutes ago.
I would've sworn I was cold.

327
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.410
I mean. look at this.
We're kicking up dust.

328
00:21:15.479 --> 00:21:16.743
The air is drier than hell.

329
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:17.981
I don't understand
what's going on.

330
00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:20.716
Whoa! Whoa!

331
00:21:22.753 --> 00:21:26.524
That was an earthquake...
in the Amazon.

332
00:21:26.592 --> 00:21:28.361
Hey. just get us safe
there. buddy. huh?

333
00:21:28.429 --> 00:21:31.096
You're doing a good job.
Everything's great.

334
00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:32.094
Everybody's doing a good job.

335
00:21:32.163 --> 00:21:33.465
Look at that!

336
00:21:36.396 --> 00:21:41.403
Look at the trees. complete
absence of moss or lichens.

337
00:21:41.472 --> 00:21:42.969
These things should be covered!

338
00:21:43.037 --> 00:21:46.443
I mean. but a catastrophic
climate shift

339
00:21:46.512 --> 00:21:50.076
would dry out
all the tree trunks.

340
00:21:50.144 --> 00:21:52.184
But this is the rainforest.
it's not a desert.

341
00:21:52.253 --> 00:21:53.684
Exactly.
That's what I'm saying.

342
00:21:53.752 --> 00:21:55.287
Maybe it's accelerated
warming at ground level

343
00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:57.786
due to the extreme
weather cycles?

344
00:21:57.854 --> 00:22:00.788
Which would suggest that
the weather patterns

345
00:22:00.857 --> 00:22:04.555
are subject to
the volcanic activity?

346
00:22:04.624 --> 00:22:06.091
Yeah. absolutely.

347
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.368
I mean. that is why
I'm here to figure out.

348
00:22:12.907 --> 00:22:13.967
What was that?

349
00:22:16.109 --> 00:22:17.542
It looked like a locust.

350
00:22:19.644 --> 00:22:21.911
Locusts go where
the climate's drying out.

351
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.143
Yeah. but this place isn't gonna
be drying out anytime soon.

352
00:22:26.847 --> 00:22:29.114
Look!
Look. look. look!

353
00:22:32.125 --> 00:22:35.391
Oh. right... whoa.

354
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.562
Yeah. before that gets here.

355
00:22:38.631 --> 00:22:40.126
we should stop and
take a quick look.

356
00:22:40.194 --> 00:22:41.430
See if we can't figure out
what's happened here

357
00:22:41.499 --> 00:22:42.630
in the last couple of hours.

358
00:22:42.699 --> 00:22:43.729
You think that's
gonna be safe?

359
00:22:43.798 --> 00:22:45.504
We'll stay close to the road.

360
00:22:47.572 --> 00:22:49.069
-Okay. Let's do that.
-Yeah?

361
00:22:49.138 --> 00:22:50.770
All right. Hey. can you find
a good spot to pull over?

362
00:22:50.838 --> 00:22:52.537
We wanna get out
and take a look.

363
00:22:52.605 --> 00:22:54.447
Thank you.

364
00:22:58.582 --> 00:23:00.717
-Let's hustle out.
-Okay.

365
00:23:02.186 --> 00:23:03.753
Okay.

366
00:23:21.302 --> 00:23:23.974
Soldiers! This is Major Oakley
Jones. United States Army!

367
00:23:24.043 --> 00:23:25.136
Major!

368
00:23:25.205 --> 00:23:27.841
Corporal Kyle Tremblay.
Canadian Army!

369
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.676
We're getting vermin out
of the area

370
00:23:29.745 --> 00:23:31.409
and securing the jungle. sir!

371
00:23:31.478 --> 00:23:35.185
Corporal. we're under explicit
orders for nonlethal engagement!

372
00:23:35.254 --> 00:23:36.853
Not anymore. Major!

373
00:23:36.922 --> 00:23:38.685
We're getting fired on
and we're gonna fire back!

374
00:23:38.754 --> 00:23:40.485
No more half measures. sir!

375
00:23:40.554 --> 00:23:43.662
Corporal. you're in violation
of the United Nations SROE!

376
00:23:43.731 --> 00:23:47.260
Cease fire and fall back on
my position immediately!

377
00:23:47.329 --> 00:23:48.868
Ahh!

378
00:23:48.936 --> 00:23:49.896
I got him!

379
00:23:49.964 --> 00:23:52.632
Did you see that. Major?
I got him!

380
00:23:52.701 --> 00:23:54.440
Let him go. Lieutenant.

381
00:23:54.509 --> 00:23:56.369
Security for Dr. Hughes
is our priority.

382
00:23:56.438 --> 00:23:58.104
Yes. sir.

383
00:24:01.608 --> 00:24:03.178
Doctor!

384
00:24:03.247 --> 00:24:04.642
Wait.

385
00:24:04.711 --> 00:24:06.085
Someone is hurt.

386
00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:08.953
Okay. but stay behind me.

387
00:24:09.022 --> 00:24:11.557
Yes. sir.

388
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:44.585
Yes. I speak English.

389
00:24:44.653 --> 00:24:46.485
What's your name. son?

390
00:24:46.554 --> 00:24:48.188
Paulo.

391
00:24:48.257 --> 00:24:50.925
I'm Major Oakley Jones
with the United States Army.

392
00:24:50.994 --> 00:24:52.696
We're gonna get you some
help. okay. Paulo?

393
00:24:52.765 --> 00:24:57.401
There's no help anymore...
for anyone.

394
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:58.632
Okay. Paulo.
Hang on...

395
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.734
You don't understand.

396
00:25:00.803 --> 00:25:04.705
Everyone is killing everyone.

397
00:25:04.774 --> 00:25:07.980
There's something... wrong.

398
00:25:08.048 --> 00:25:10.542
It's evil.

399
00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:35.433
Foxtrot Command Scavenger.

400
00:25:35.502 --> 00:25:39.574
Request Medevac on my
immediate location... 1CI.

401
00:25:39.642 --> 00:25:41.108
Foxtrot. how do you read?

402
00:25:41.177 --> 00:25:43.010
Major. we've gotta get moving.
We gotta go fast.

403
00:25:43.079 --> 00:25:44.782
We don't want
to get stuck in that.

404
00:25:44.851 --> 00:25:45.843
Okay. We're gonna have
to handle this ourselves.

405
00:25:45.912 --> 00:25:47.347
Let's get him loaded up.

406
00:25:47.416 --> 00:25:49.182
Major...

407
00:25:53.687 --> 00:25:55.056
I never...

408
00:25:57.631 --> 00:26:03.636
I was just trying
to protect my crops.

409
00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:08.837
That was the Fifth Seal...

410
00:26:08.906 --> 00:26:11.006
those who are martyred
for their faith.

411
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.381
Sergeant Wayne!

412
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:20.311
Sir. we gotta get out of here.

413
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.283
Okay. let's go.
Let's go. Sergeant.

414
00:26:50.711 --> 00:26:52.080
Look out!

415
00:27:00.156 --> 00:27:02.760
You guys better
get to higher ground.

416
00:27:02.829 --> 00:27:04.224
I have to get out of here.
Good luck.

417
00:27:10.237 --> 00:27:11.671
Go. go. go. go!

418
00:27:25.186 --> 00:27:26.950
Ah. thank you.

419
00:27:45.402 --> 00:27:46.970
Wow!

420
00:27:51.775 --> 00:27:54.179
-You okay?
-Yeah.

421
00:27:54.248 --> 00:27:55.308
Oh. that's...

422
00:28:06.086 --> 00:28:07.419
Well...
Well...

423
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:12.864
Looks like
we're gonna be here a bit.

424
00:28:32.852 --> 00:28:34.314
No disrespect. Major.
you really think

425
00:28:34.382 --> 00:28:36.481
this has something
to do with the Bible?

426
00:28:38.457 --> 00:28:40.958
I do. That I do.

427
00:28:42.857 --> 00:28:44.224
Time will tell.

428
00:28:44.293 --> 00:28:46.530
Lt's just hope
preventing the Apocalypse

429
00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:48.331
is all part of God's plan.

430
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.066
Amen.

431
00:28:55.969 --> 00:28:57.573
Is that smoke?

432
00:28:57.642 --> 00:28:59.509
Something's wrong.

433
00:28:59.578 --> 00:29:00.846
Where is everybody?

434
00:29:02.446 --> 00:29:04.579
Man. that storm really put
an ass whooping on us. sir.

435
00:29:04.648 --> 00:29:07.252
Sure did. Sarge.

436
00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:08.679
Make a sweep.

437
00:29:08.748 --> 00:29:11.090
The other scientists should
have been here by now.

438
00:29:11.159 --> 00:29:12.284
Yes. sir.

439
00:29:12.353 --> 00:29:15.089
Where do you think
everyone went?

440
00:29:15.158 --> 00:29:17.061
Don't know. No signs of
firefight.

441
00:29:17.129 --> 00:29:19.359
There are no shell casings
or small weapons damage.

442
00:29:19.428 --> 00:29:21.995
Would they have fled
because of the storm?

443
00:29:22.064 --> 00:29:23.495
No signs of rapid departure.

444
00:29:23.563 --> 00:29:25.535
Conditions are bad.
but they'd be better off

445
00:29:25.604 --> 00:29:27.037
just hunkering down.

446
00:29:36.281 --> 00:29:40.485
Major. we need to reestablish
that satellite link now.

447
00:29:40.554 --> 00:29:42.253
Okay. but just hold on.

448
00:29:42.322 --> 00:29:44.186
As soon as the base is cleared.
we'll get the power running.

449
00:29:54.035 --> 00:29:56.032
Sir. it looks like the lightning
took out our generators.

450
00:29:56.101 --> 00:29:58.930
So we've got no power?
Can we fix it?

451
00:29:58.999 --> 00:30:00.634
Not fast enough.

452
00:30:00.703 --> 00:30:02.374
There's a radio station a few
klicks from here we can try.

453
00:30:02.443 --> 00:30:03.667
If it's not damaged.

454
00:30:03.736 --> 00:30:05.742
we can get you linked up
to the satellite there.

455
00:30:05.811 --> 00:30:07.271
Then what are we waiting for?

456
00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.409
All right. let's Oscar Mike.

457
00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:30.797
So what's the plan?

458
00:30:30.866 --> 00:30:33.171
I don't know.

459
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.799
We were going that way. but the
road disappears into the trees.

460
00:30:35.868 --> 00:30:38.944
If it takes a bend. there's
a fork in the road...

461
00:30:41.113 --> 00:30:43.080
I think we need to signal
for help somehow.

462
00:30:48.753 --> 00:30:50.282
Do you have any matches?

463
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:52.591
Or a lighter?
Or anything?

464
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.818
I have some hygroscopic flares.

465
00:30:54.887 --> 00:30:57.092
I was gonna do some cloud
seeding for the fires. Why?

466
00:30:57.161 --> 00:31:00.499
Yeah. yeah. that'll work.
Let me have one.

467
00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:01.765
What are you thinking?

468
00:31:01.834 --> 00:31:03.462
I'm thinking I start a fire

469
00:31:03.531 --> 00:31:06.068
and try the old smoke
signal routine.

470
00:31:06.137 --> 00:31:07.770
Do you think
that's a good idea?

471
00:31:07.838 --> 00:31:09.335
Do you have a better one?

472
00:31:09.404 --> 00:31:10.976
Look. with the timeframe
that we're on.

473
00:31:11.044 --> 00:31:12.737
we can't afford
for help to come to us.

474
00:31:12.805 --> 00:31:15.078
We need to get back to the
rest of the group. ASAP.

475
00:31:15.147 --> 00:31:18.378
Yeah. that...
Okay. that makes sense.

476
00:31:18.447 --> 00:31:20.247
Look. I've done it
a couple of times.

477
00:31:20.316 --> 00:31:22.221
I was in the Boy Scouts.
It'll be fine.

478
00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:23.582
Here.

479
00:31:30.992 --> 00:31:32.025
Be careful.

480
00:31:32.094 --> 00:31:34.092
Get Scavenger on the line.

481
00:31:34.161 --> 00:31:36.265
Right away. ma'am.

482
00:31:37.331 --> 00:31:38.997
-Scavenger. Zeus.

483
00:31:39.066 --> 00:31:40.372
How do you read?

484
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.433
Scavenger!

485
00:31:41.502 --> 00:31:43.804
Would somebody fix
these damn comms?

486
00:31:43.873 --> 00:31:45.274
Yes. Aidan.

487
00:31:45.343 --> 00:31:47.912
We've lost communication
with Foxtrot Command.

488
00:31:47.981 --> 00:31:49.476
Looks like the problem
is on their end.

489
00:31:49.544 --> 00:31:51.248
and not necessarily
from storm interference.

490
00:31:51.316 --> 00:31:54.218
We did receive confirmation
that Doctor Rodney

491
00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:56.253
and Doctor Lenna landed
safely at the airfield.

492
00:31:56.321 --> 00:31:58.820
But then we lost communication
with their transport

493
00:31:58.889 --> 00:32:00.218
enroute to Foxtrot.

494
00:32:00.286 --> 00:32:01.553
Contact the 4th Fleet.

495
00:32:01.622 --> 00:32:03.459
I want to err on the
side of caution

496
00:32:03.528 --> 00:32:05.229
that possibly they could have
had a vehicle breakdown

497
00:32:05.298 --> 00:32:08.559
or worse. could have
encountered rebel resistance.

498
00:32:08.628 --> 00:32:10.728
I want a pararescue
team deployed

499
00:32:10.796 --> 00:32:12.162
to their last known location
immediately.

500
00:32:12.231 --> 00:32:13.566
Yes. General.

501
00:32:44.605 --> 00:32:46.731
Yes. yes. yes. yes!

502
00:32:51.841 --> 00:32:53.309
No...

503
00:33:08.688 --> 00:33:11.525
Wait a minute.
Are those smoke signals?

504
00:33:12.898 --> 00:33:14.693
-- 00!
-I see it.

505
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:21.469
Look out!

506
00:33:22.536 --> 00:33:24.604
-Hold tight!

507
00:33:27.774 --> 00:33:30.046
Elliot! Elliot!
I think I see a car!

508
00:33:30.114 --> 00:33:31.577
-Hey! Hey!
-Dakota. wait!

509
00:33:31.646 --> 00:33:33.819
Is that one of
your scientists up there?

510
00:33:33.888 --> 00:33:35.151
I don't know who
else it could be.

511
00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.287
No civilians out
this deep in the bush.

512
00:33:38.685 --> 00:33:40.924
No. no. no!
Dakota. it's not safe!

513
00:33:40.993 --> 00:33:42.325
We don't know who they are!

514
00:33:43.926 --> 00:33:45.163
Dakota!

515
00:33:53.673 --> 00:33:54.940
Dr. Dakota Lenna?

516
00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:56.868
-Yes. Major Jones?
-Affirmative.

517
00:33:56.937 --> 00:33:58.802
Do you know the whereabouts
of Dr. Elliot Rodney?

518
00:33:58.871 --> 00:34:02.481
Yes. He's the one making
the smoke signals.

519
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.440
There he is!

520
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:05.781
-Ah!

521
00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:07.317
What the...

522
00:34:10.756 --> 00:34:13.488
Come on!
Come on!

523
00:34:14.253 --> 00:34:15.556
Dakota!

524
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.863
Get in!

525
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:23.162
Let's go. guys.

526
00:34:23.231 --> 00:34:24.595
Dr. Elliot Rodney?

527
00:34:24.663 --> 00:34:28.270
That's me!
Nice to meet you.

528
00:34:28.338 --> 00:34:29.639
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on!

529
00:34:29.708 --> 00:34:30.802
Let's go.

530
00:34:36.615 --> 00:34:38.381
Come on!

531
00:34:46.925 --> 00:34:48.125
Are those locusts?

532
00:34:48.194 --> 00:34:51.130
Yes!
There's a lot of them. too!

533
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:54.692
Come on. come on!

534
00:34:54.761 --> 00:34:55.966
Doesn't this thing
go any faster?

535
00:34:56.035 --> 00:34:57.433
Going as fast as I can. doctor!

536
00:35:00.239 --> 00:35:02.407
Major. how good of
a shot are you?

537
00:35:02.476 --> 00:35:05.943
Did three tours in Afghanistan
as a forward recon sniper. Why?

538
00:35:06.012 --> 00:35:07.740
Yeah?
That'll do it.

539
00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:14.786
Metharizium acridum!

540
00:35:14.855 --> 00:35:16.451
What. is that like a bug bomb?

541
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.288
Kinda. it's a
fungal-oil based compound

542
00:35:18.357 --> 00:35:21.293
that disrupts
their oxygen exchange.

543
00:35:21.362 --> 00:35:23.058
Basically kills them without
killing everything else.

544
00:35:23.127 --> 00:35:24.491
Oh. God. that's so clever.

545
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.890
It wouldn't destroy
all of the birds.

546
00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:27.357
and it wouldn't kill off
their food chain supply.

547
00:35:27.426 --> 00:35:28.727
Exactly. exactly.

548
00:35:28.796 --> 00:35:30.597
The fungus attaches to
the exoskeleton

549
00:35:30.666 --> 00:35:32.504
and disrupts their exchange
of oxygen.

550
00:35:32.573 --> 00:35:36.905
causing organic death without
spreading to other species.

551
00:35:36.974 --> 00:35:38.408
Do you spray it?

552
00:35:38.477 --> 00:35:39.838
No. I usually do a
controlled burn in the fields.

553
00:35:39.906 --> 00:35:42.245
But the canister itself
is pressurized.

554
00:35:42.314 --> 00:35:43.576
If the major puts
a bullet through it.

555
00:35:43.645 --> 00:35:46.116
it should explode
dispensing a cloud

556
00:35:46.184 --> 00:35:49.551
-It's worth a shot.
-Genius.

557
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:53.357
-Yeah?
-Okay. let's do it.

558
00:35:53.426 --> 00:35:55.225
Cover your ears.
This gunshot's gonna be loud.

559
00:35:55.294 --> 00:35:57.592
On your count. Major!
On your command!

560
00:36:01.297 --> 00:36:03.268
-Ah!
-I got you!

561
00:36:04.803 --> 00:36:05.529
Thank you.

562
00:36:05.597 --> 00:36:08.570
-Major!
-Hold!

563
00:36:14.009 --> 00:36:16.273
Now!

564
00:36:19.015 --> 00:36:20.982
Nice shot!

565
00:36:25.188 --> 00:36:26.885
Nice shooting. Major.

566
00:36:33.233 --> 00:36:34.829
What happened
to your transport?

567
00:36:34.898 --> 00:36:38.533
We stopped to do some tests
and there was a flash flood.

568
00:36:38.602 --> 00:36:40.965
It took it and our driver
away with it.

569
00:36:43.102 --> 00:36:45.572
Hey. I didn't get your
guys' names. by the way.

570
00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.604
Apologies.
Major Oakley Jones.

571
00:36:47.673 --> 00:36:49.446
This is Sergeant Shockley.

572
00:36:49.515 --> 00:36:51.509
Lieutenant Rohrbacher.
United States Army.

573
00:36:51.577 --> 00:36:53.317
Nice to meet you guys.

574
00:36:53.386 --> 00:36:54.714
Thanks for saving
our asses back there.

575
00:36:54.783 --> 00:36:56.985
Pleasure to meet you.
Elliot Rodney.

576
00:36:57.054 --> 00:36:58.488
Dakota Lenna.

577
00:36:58.557 --> 00:37:00.656
Lynise Hughes.
Glad to make your acquaintances.

578
00:37:00.725 --> 00:37:03.562
albeit I wish it was
under better circumstances.

579
00:37:03.631 --> 00:37:05.730
Hell. maybe can all go for a
beer after this is over. huh?

580
00:37:05.798 --> 00:37:07.063
I hope so.

581
00:37:07.132 --> 00:37:10.533
Major. where are we going?

582
00:37:10.602 --> 00:37:12.899
Radio tower.
Comms were down back at base.

583
00:37:12.968 --> 00:37:14.969
Dr. Hughes needs to patch
into her satellite network.

584
00:37:15.038 --> 00:37:16.706
Yeah.

585
00:37:16.775 --> 00:37:19.509
I'm confident that I've located
the epicenter for the eruption.

586
00:37:19.578 --> 00:37:22.544
But now I need to
pinpoint an exact location.

587
00:37:22.613 --> 00:37:24.747
What is your proposed
plan of action?

588
00:37:24.816 --> 00:37:25.976
Bomb it.

589
00:37:26.045 --> 00:37:28.117
Seriously?
In the middle of the Amazon?

590
00:37:28.186 --> 00:37:29.518
Well. we don't have much time.

591
00:37:29.587 --> 00:37:31.149
And we're too far along in
the process

592
00:37:31.218 --> 00:37:33.686
to attempt depressurization or
aperture venting techniques.

593
00:37:33.755 --> 00:37:35.393
So this is the only
chance we have

594
00:37:35.462 --> 00:37:37.396
of stopping it from destroying
the entire world.

595
00:37:37.464 --> 00:37:40.294
That's why I need
to determine the exact location

596
00:37:40.362 --> 00:37:42.501
and the exact drop point.

597
00:37:42.569 --> 00:37:45.668
Also. at the rate these
earthquakes are escalating.

598
00:37:45.737 --> 00:37:48.538
my guess is this eruption
is coming sooner. not later.

599
00:37:48.606 --> 00:37:50.639
I need to get the SAT link
up and running

600
00:37:50.708 --> 00:37:52.569
so that I can determine
the exact timeframe

601
00:37:52.638 --> 00:37:54.342
before the eruption.

602
00:37:54.411 --> 00:37:56.009
Oh. Elliot. I meant to ask you.

603
00:37:56.078 --> 00:37:57.808
I saw a fungus at the site
that did not look familiar.

604
00:37:57.877 --> 00:37:59.616
Orange palette?
Black spots?

605
00:37:59.685 --> 00:38:00.851
-Kinda looks like carrots?
-Yeah! So you've seen it?

606
00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.146
Yes. indeed.

607
00:38:02.214 --> 00:38:03.584
I have a sample of it
with me here in my bag.

608
00:38:03.652 --> 00:38:04.615
As soon as we get
to the station.

609
00:38:04.683 --> 00:38:05.983
I'll set up a field test.

610
00:38:06.052 --> 00:38:07.723
to determine whether or
not it's related

611
00:38:07.791 --> 00:38:08.858
to the geothermal activity
we've been experiencing.

612
00:38:08.927 --> 00:38:09.720
Great.

613
00:38:09.789 --> 00:38:11.055
Whoo. this is up here. huh?

614
00:38:12.494 --> 00:38:13.658
What about you. Dr. Lenna?

615
00:38:13.727 --> 00:38:15.125
In my professional opinion.

616
00:38:15.194 --> 00:38:17.166
these are clearly
unpredictable weather cycles.

617
00:38:17.234 --> 00:38:18.700
but it's not distinct.

618
00:38:18.768 --> 00:38:21.402
It's definitely
the geothermal-related.

619
00:38:21.471 --> 00:38:22.701
based upon all of your tests.

620
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:25.638
But these erratic weather
patterns

621
00:38:25.707 --> 00:38:27.609
are definitely coming
from all

622
00:38:27.678 --> 00:38:31.416
of these potential
volcanic eruptions.

623
00:38:31.484 --> 00:38:33.678
And it's coming from
this immediate area.

624
00:38:33.747 --> 00:38:35.645
How much farther. Sergeant?

625
00:38:35.714 --> 00:38:37.114
Almost there. ma'am.

626
00:38:43.696 --> 00:38:46.824
Okay. we're gonna need to
pull over here and go on foot.

627
00:38:46.892 --> 00:38:48.697
If there are any
rebel hold outs.

628
00:38:48.766 --> 00:38:50.732
we can't run the risk of
them hearing our vehicle.

629
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:08.783
Stay alert.

630
00:39:24.233 --> 00:39:26.904
This way.

631
00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:29.106
Wait. Does anyone else hear...

632
00:39:29.175 --> 00:39:30.772
Stay close and stay quiet.

633
00:39:55.335 --> 00:39:57.464
-You okay. Sergeant?
-Yes. sir.

634
00:39:57.532 --> 00:39:59.064
A headache coming on.

635
00:40:04.008 --> 00:40:06.911
Stay behind us. There's been
rebel activity in this area.

636
00:40:06.979 --> 00:40:08.040
Copy that.

637
00:40:10.844 --> 00:40:12.310
This is never going to work.

638
00:40:12.379 --> 00:40:13.445
Why not?

639
00:40:13.514 --> 00:40:14.849
Just look at it.

640
00:40:19.919 --> 00:40:21.592
Once we know the area is secure.

641
00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.124
I'll get the radio
tower up and running.

642
00:40:23.193 --> 00:40:24.161
Good.

643
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:25.928
After we locate the epicenter.

644
00:40:25.997 --> 00:40:28.293
it's just a matter of collapsing
the volcano's magma chamber.

645
00:40:28.362 --> 00:40:30.463
The Pentagon should be
able to provide enough ordnance

646
00:40:30.532 --> 00:40:32.032
to get the job done.

647
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.337
If we're successful.
the cataclysmic weather events

648
00:40:34.406 --> 00:40:36.541
should dissipate worldwide.

649
00:40:36.609 --> 00:40:38.842
Assuming all of our
findings are sound.

650
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:41.777
Correct. Bottom line.
it's the best chance we have.

651
00:40:57.931 --> 00:40:59.295
Clear!

652
00:40:59.363 --> 00:41:00.697
Lead us in. Sergeant.

653
00:41:35.497 --> 00:41:38.100
Hold. hold...

654
00:41:38.169 --> 00:41:39.736
Move out.

655
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.674
Follow me.

656
00:42:04.661 --> 00:42:06.257
Sergeant. on the perimeter!

657
00:42:25.213 --> 00:42:27.619
Shockley! On the perimeter!
Now. soldier!

658
00:42:28.915 --> 00:42:31.154
I need that sat link ASAP!

659
00:42:33.789 --> 00:42:35.053
I can't get a clear channel.

660
00:42:35.122 --> 00:42:37.794
-Well. keep trying.
-I am trying!

661
00:42:42.401 --> 00:42:43.800
If today I lose my hope. Lord.

662
00:42:43.868 --> 00:42:46.165
please remind me
that Your plans are greater.

663
00:42:50.674 --> 00:42:51.905
Hey. that storm is coming in.

664
00:42:51.974 --> 00:42:53.676
We better have good
radios. otherwise

665
00:42:53.745 --> 00:42:55.778
on the tower
there won't be a signal.

666
00:42:55.847 --> 00:42:59.580
In a building this old?
Yeah. sure.

667
00:42:59.648 --> 00:43:01.083
How's it going. major?

668
00:43:04.391 --> 00:43:07.054
How's it going?
Major!

669
00:43:07.122 --> 00:43:09.324
I think the issue's
on the tower itself.

670
00:43:09.393 --> 00:43:10.794
Lieutenant!

671
00:43:18.001 --> 00:43:20.465
I'm gonna go examine
my funky specimens.

672
00:43:20.534 --> 00:43:24.071
But I need to do that away
from everybody. just in case.

673
00:43:25.205 --> 00:43:27.077
I'll be back
when I have something.

674
00:43:27.146 --> 00:43:30.107
Okay.

675
00:43:30.175 --> 00:43:33.344
Sergeant Shockley?
Sergeant!

676
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.818
He's not our priority right now.
That is!

677
00:43:36.887 --> 00:43:38.855
Come on.
Let's find the access ladder.

678
00:43:41.125 --> 00:43:43.893
Look. I need to know the
exact epicenter of the volcano

679
00:43:43.961 --> 00:43:45.763
so I know how much
ordnance that we need.

680
00:43:45.831 --> 00:43:47.725
And I cannot do that
without a sat link.

681
00:43:47.794 --> 00:43:49.195
Right. okay.

682
00:44:13.355 --> 00:44:15.925
You. um. you said you had taken
some tests earlier.

683
00:44:15.994 --> 00:44:18.088
Can you share some of
that information with me?

684
00:44:18.157 --> 00:44:19.562
-Oh. yeah.
-Oh. great.

685
00:44:19.631 --> 00:44:21.291
So. This was taken earlier.

686
00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.898
Obviously. it's not
a livestream

687
00:44:22.967 --> 00:44:24.329
because we don't have
satellite access.

688
00:44:24.397 --> 00:44:27.503
but you see all these
clouds dispersing?

689
00:44:27.571 --> 00:44:29.365
So they all disperse.

690
00:44:29.434 --> 00:44:31.105
and then they
come back together.

691
00:44:31.174 --> 00:44:34.008
which means that there are
all correlated.

692
00:44:34.077 --> 00:44:35.847
they're not independent
from one another.

693
00:44:35.915 --> 00:44:37.443
Yeah. that's great that
you can confirm that.

694
00:44:37.512 --> 00:44:38.882
Exactly.

695
00:44:38.951 --> 00:44:40.084
And you see all these
weather conditions?

696
00:44:40.153 --> 00:44:41.413
Uh-huh.

697
00:44:41.481 --> 00:44:43.816
This is what's causing all
the locust infestations.

698
00:44:43.885 --> 00:44:45.418
-Copy that.
-Yeah.

699
00:44:45.486 --> 00:44:48.925
Okay. so the last piece of
the puzzle is that fungus.

700
00:44:48.994 --> 00:44:50.655
We need to figure out if
that's connected as well.

701
00:44:50.724 --> 00:44:52.495
Right.

702
00:44:52.564 --> 00:44:53.794
I'm gonna check on Elliot.

703
00:44:53.863 --> 00:44:55.394
Shouldn't you put a mask on?

704
00:44:55.463 --> 00:44:58.202
Oh. I'm not gonna go in.
I'm just gonna check on him.

705
00:44:58.271 --> 00:44:58.995
Yeah. yeah. yeah?

706
00:44:59.064 --> 00:45:00.337
-Elliot?
-What?

707
00:45:00.406 --> 00:45:01.766
How's it going in there?

708
00:45:01.835 --> 00:45:03.071
I'm almost done.

709
00:45:03.506 --> 00:45:04.402
Great!

710
00:45:11.813 --> 00:45:14.116
How's it looking. Major?

711
00:45:14.185 --> 00:45:17.987
Yeah. looks like the tower
got hit by lightning.

712
00:45:19.122 --> 00:45:21.221
Just burned out some
circuits and wires.

713
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:24.796
I'm repairing them...
repairing them now.

714
00:45:27.065 --> 00:45:30.098
Just a few more minutes.
Any sign of the Sergeant?

715
00:45:40.745 --> 00:45:42.341
I'm gonna go check on the Major.

716
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:46.384
Major?

717
00:45:46.452 --> 00:45:48.316
Major. where are you?

718
00:45:48.385 --> 00:45:50.085
Up here!

719
00:45:51.918 --> 00:45:53.253
I'm coming.

720
00:45:57.924 --> 00:45:59.991
I'm hung up.

721
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.130
-Ah!
-There we go.

722
00:46:04.868 --> 00:46:07.164
-Thank you.
-Of course.

723
00:46:07.233 --> 00:46:08.972
We can't afford to lose you.

724
00:46:10.001 --> 00:46:11.674
How is it?

725
00:46:11.743 --> 00:46:15.206
Just some burned out wires.

726
00:46:15.275 --> 00:46:16.913
-It should work now.
-Great.

727
00:46:16.982 --> 00:46:19.147
-I'll meet you back down there.
-Okay.

728
00:46:26.752 --> 00:46:29.828
-Are my men inside with you?
-No. I haven't seen them.

729
00:46:31.124 --> 00:46:32.424
I'll be in in a second.

730
00:46:37.802 --> 00:46:40.366
Shockley. what are you... whoa!

731
00:46:51.844 --> 00:46:53.544
Ah!

732
00:47:13.738 --> 00:47:15.874
How bad is it. Lieutenant?

733
00:47:15.942 --> 00:47:17.033
He got me in the oblique.
Missed the organs.

734
00:47:17.102 --> 00:47:18.668
I'm okay. sir.

735
00:47:18.737 --> 00:47:19.936
The antenna's working.
You have some paracord on you?

736
00:47:20.005 --> 00:47:21.407
Yes. sir.

737
00:47:21.476 --> 00:47:23.011
Bind Shockley. then
there's a skin stapler

738
00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.342
in the first aid kit
in the Jeep.

739
00:47:24.411 --> 00:47:26.379
-Close that wound up.
-Yes. sir.

740
00:47:27.981 --> 00:47:29.718
And be careful.

741
00:47:29.786 --> 00:47:30.918
Shockley's burning up.

742
00:47:30.987 --> 00:47:33.155
Could be malaria... or worse.

743
00:47:36.289 --> 00:47:38.224
Sergeant Shockley became ill.

744
00:47:38.293 --> 00:47:40.123
The Lieutenant's
outside binding him now.

745
00:47:40.192 --> 00:47:42.030
I just put him to sleep.

746
00:47:42.099 --> 00:47:43.528
Anybody starts feeling bad.
speak up.

747
00:47:43.597 --> 00:47:46.570
This is a particularly
bad case of malaria.

748
00:47:46.639 --> 00:47:48.498
Dr. Hughes. what's the status?

749
00:47:48.567 --> 00:47:49.937
I'm working on
establishing a link.

750
00:47:50.006 --> 00:47:51.104
It should be ready in a minute.

751
00:47:51.173 --> 00:47:53.142
Okay.
Let me call the General.

752
00:47:54.777 --> 00:47:55.977
Zeus. Scavenger?

753
00:47:56.046 --> 00:47:59.350
Zeus. Scavenger.
Come in. Zeus.

754
00:47:59.419 --> 00:48:01.548
Zeus. Scavenger.

755
00:48:01.617 --> 00:48:03.614
Zeus. we've been trying to
hail you for some time now.

756
00:48:03.683 --> 00:48:05.752
Foxtrot was just hit bad
by the storms. General.

757
00:48:05.821 --> 00:48:07.217
disabling comms.

758
00:48:07.286 --> 00:48:08.785
We've had to mobilize offsite.

759
00:48:08.853 --> 00:48:10.656
But our guests have
narrowed down the location

760
00:48:10.725 --> 00:48:14.991
of the disturbance and arrived
at a plan on how to proceed.

761
00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.529
Go ahead.

762
00:48:16.597 --> 00:48:18.836
The only option we have is
to drop massive ordnance

763
00:48:18.904 --> 00:48:22.238
on the epicenter
and seal the vent.

764
00:48:22.307 --> 00:48:25.340
I'm requesting air assistance
to deliver a GBU-43B

765
00:48:25.408 --> 00:48:29.475
to location coordinates
soon to follow. ma'am.

766
00:48:29.543 --> 00:48:32.381
Understood.
I'll contact the 4th Fleet.

767
00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:35.853
I'll send a Black Hawk and two
Chinooks to evac your team.

768
00:48:35.922 --> 00:48:37.921
One with a GBU-43B
and the other

769
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:39.720
with a Massive
Ordnance Penetrator.

770
00:48:39.788 --> 00:48:43.724
If one or both of those don't
do the trick. then God help us.

771
00:48:43.793 --> 00:48:45.161
Yes. General.

772
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:48.025
Confirmation ordnance
request received. ETA...

773
00:48:48.094 --> 00:48:49.394
three hours.

774
00:48:49.463 --> 00:48:51.035
What are your
target coordinates?

775
00:48:51.104 --> 00:48:52.465
I should have them
in a couple of minutes.

776
00:48:52.534 --> 00:48:53.868
It's just everything
is still running slow

777
00:48:53.937 --> 00:48:55.270
because of all the storms.

778
00:48:55.338 --> 00:48:58.971
Stand by for exact
coordinates. General.

779
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.473
Copy. Standing by.

780
00:49:04.048 --> 00:49:05.746
Sergeant Shockley
is secured. sir.

781
00:49:05.815 --> 00:49:07.183
Good. Lieutenant.

782
00:49:16.087 --> 00:49:17.556
General?

783
00:49:24.336 --> 00:49:27.203
Scavenger. we're detecting
a massive storm system

784
00:49:27.272 --> 00:49:30.003
headed straight for your
vicinity. ETA 30 minutes.

785
00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:32.109
Advise you to take cover.

786
00:49:32.877 --> 00:49:34.209
We're inside a solid structure

787
00:49:34.278 --> 00:49:36.645
to ride out any
inclement weather. Zeus.

788
00:49:36.713 --> 00:49:38.849
Copy that.

789
00:49:38.918 --> 00:49:40.617
Do you have those
coordinates yet?

790
00:49:40.685 --> 00:49:42.717
Yes. it's um...

791
00:49:53.698 --> 00:49:54.791
Everybody okay?

792
00:49:57.364 --> 00:49:59.096
That was the worst one yet.

793
00:50:08.376 --> 00:50:10.211
Oh. God!
We lost the connection!

794
00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.980
Sounded like the
radio antenna. sir!

795
00:50:13.049 --> 00:50:14.415
Zeus.
Scavenger...

796
00:50:16.248 --> 00:50:17.249
We lost them.

797
00:50:17.318 --> 00:50:19.385
Let's go check out the antenna.

798
00:50:19.454 --> 00:50:22.093
I have to go secure
those samples.

799
00:50:52.725 --> 00:50:54.291
Antenna is wasted.

800
00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.620
Crumpled like a tin can
with that last earthquake.

801
00:50:55.689 --> 00:50:56.989
No. Major.
I need the satellite link!

802
00:50:57.058 --> 00:50:58.693
I understand!

803
00:50:58.762 --> 00:51:00.694
Look. there's an abandoned
airfield north of Lago Do Fodo.

804
00:51:00.763 --> 00:51:02.999
We can try to link up there.
but it was rebel-controlled.

805
00:51:03.068 --> 00:51:04.428
Okay.
Well. we have no choice.

806
00:51:04.497 --> 00:51:05.867
How close is it to the lake?

807
00:51:05.936 --> 00:51:07.469
It's right on the water.

808
00:51:07.538 --> 00:51:09.306
Plus. there's old helicopters
and heavy ordnance.

809
00:51:09.374 --> 00:51:11.742
Failsafe if anything
happens to our air assets.

810
00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.508
Okay then. let's do that.

811
00:51:13.577 --> 00:51:15.475
At least we'll have some options
if it comes to that.

812
00:51:15.544 --> 00:51:17.213
-Let's go.
-What about the Sergeant. sir?

813
00:51:17.282 --> 00:51:18.774
Escaped.
I found his kit by the antenna.

814
00:51:18.843 --> 00:51:20.111
We'll have to move
on without him.

815
00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.186
Elliot. let's go!

816
00:51:38.837 --> 00:51:40.501
Stay low and move quick.

817
00:52:15.935 --> 00:52:17.767
Hey. Elliot. did you get
a chance to learn anything

818
00:52:17.835 --> 00:52:19.373
from the fungus
samples you took?

819
00:52:19.441 --> 00:52:21.538
Oh. yeah. yeah.
More bad news.

820
00:52:21.607 --> 00:52:23.942
As if we need more of that.

821
00:52:24.011 --> 00:52:29.351
Well. this fungi is similar
to a rhodotorula graminis.

822
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.252
That's a fungus
found in volcanoes.

823
00:52:31.321 --> 00:52:33.620
Yes. but unlike that one.
this one

824
00:52:33.689 --> 00:52:35.389
has an additional membrane
which indicates

825
00:52:35.458 --> 00:52:37.492
it originates in water...
likely the lake.

826
00:52:37.561 --> 00:52:40.357
The bad news is that
it's laced with toxins.

827
00:52:40.426 --> 00:52:42.497
So like most fungi.

828
00:52:42.566 --> 00:52:44.160
if the structural integrity
is comprised.

829
00:52:44.229 --> 00:52:46.730
say. for example. if you step
on it. it releases spores.

830
00:52:46.799 --> 00:52:48.565
So as far as
the major's theory goes.

831
00:52:48.634 --> 00:52:50.705
that it's a malaria outbreak.

832
00:52:50.773 --> 00:52:53.970
it's probably actually
this little fungi responsible

833
00:52:54.038 --> 00:52:56.307
for all the symptoms.
the disorientation

834
00:52:56.376 --> 00:52:58.415
and fever and stuff.

835
00:52:58.483 --> 00:53:00.877
Yeah. and also with all storms
and the weather cycles.

836
00:53:00.946 --> 00:53:02.814
the precipitation's most
likely carrying

837
00:53:02.883 --> 00:53:04.180
all the spores into
the upper atmosphere.

838
00:53:04.249 --> 00:53:05.485
Correct.

839
00:53:05.554 --> 00:53:07.216
As far as mitigating
the infection.

840
00:53:07.285 --> 00:53:09.458
a high dose of oxygen should be
enough to suffocate the fungi.

841
00:53:13.327 --> 00:53:15.563
Major! We gotta go!

842
00:53:20.173 --> 00:53:22.669
Everybody!
Get in the truck now!

843
00:53:31.913 --> 00:53:34.447
Looks like our route
is blocked by the wildfire.

844
00:53:34.516 --> 00:53:35.545
We'll be safer closer to
the lake.

845
00:53:35.614 --> 00:53:36.914
but we have to go on foot.

846
00:53:48.195 --> 00:53:49.597
This way.

847
00:53:50.697 --> 00:53:52.831
The lake is only
a few miles ahead.

848
00:54:12.551 --> 00:54:13.750
There's the air base.

849
00:54:13.819 --> 00:54:15.722
Follow this river
bed around to it.

850
00:54:20.931 --> 00:54:23.230
Hey. guys?

851
00:54:23.298 --> 00:54:24.531
I'm gonna catch right up.

852
00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.096
I wanna grab a
quick water sample

853
00:54:26.164 --> 00:54:29.070
and verify that the fungus
is indeed from here.

854
00:54:29.139 --> 00:54:30.237
I'll stay with you.

855
00:54:30.306 --> 00:54:31.639
I'll hang back and cover them.

856
00:54:32.974 --> 00:54:37.743
Fungus has to exist in a
relatively low acid environment.

857
00:54:37.812 --> 00:54:39.746
I'm wondering if this
is the place.

858
00:54:41.415 --> 00:54:43.251
Sounds like a plan.

859
00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.514
With that added membrane...

860
00:54:44.583 --> 00:54:46.489
I'm pretty sure...

861
00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:52.495
that this is the body
of water it's in.

862
00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:02.800
Let's hold. I don't wanna
separate the group too far.

863
00:55:02.869 --> 00:55:04.374
Major. we're running
out of time.

864
00:55:04.443 --> 00:55:06.175
I can't do anything
without that link.

865
00:55:06.244 --> 00:55:07.842
Under normal circumstances.

866
00:55:07.911 --> 00:55:10.645
the volcanic activity would
make the lake highly acidic.

867
00:55:14.986 --> 00:55:16.112
Water pH is 8.5.

868
00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:18.349
This is definitely
the source of the fungus.

869
00:55:18.418 --> 00:55:20.121
Oh my gosh.

870
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:21.756
Which makes total sense.

871
00:55:21.825 --> 00:55:23.759
The sediment in the lake
is limestone... it's alkaline.

872
00:55:23.828 --> 00:55:26.931
That's how the massive spores
have been able to survive.

873
00:55:26.999 --> 00:55:28.432
There's zero acidity.

874
00:55:31.467 --> 00:55:33.833
This is it.
We found it.

875
00:55:35.536 --> 00:55:37.034
I wanna collect some more.

876
00:55:43.579 --> 00:55:44.941
You guys. we have
to keep moving.

877
00:55:45.009 --> 00:55:47.210
Yes. yes. of course.
of course.

878
00:55:47.279 --> 00:55:49.685
So. I'm having a thought.
Follow me through on this.

879
00:55:49.754 --> 00:55:53.386
I want to try to combine
the fungus and the acridum.

880
00:55:53.455 --> 00:55:55.358
make kind of a concoction.

881
00:55:55.427 --> 00:55:56.588
And douse my little
friends with it.

882
00:55:56.657 --> 00:55:58.088
essentially infecting them.

883
00:55:58.157 --> 00:56:00.462
then set them loose on
the rest of the swarm.

884
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:01.997
-That's a great idea.
-Right?

885
00:56:02.066 --> 00:56:03.033
That should work.

886
00:56:03.102 --> 00:56:04.897
Bingo. bango. no more locusts.

887
00:56:44.777 --> 00:56:46.710
General!

888
00:56:46.779 --> 00:56:49.007
We just lost both birds carrying
our payload over the Atlantic!

889
00:56:53.145 --> 00:56:54.743
This road takes us
away from the river.

890
00:56:54.812 --> 00:56:56.185
but it should be faster.

891
00:56:56.254 --> 00:56:57.653
The base is just ahead.

892
00:57:02.624 --> 00:57:04.829
Scavenger! Zeus!
Do you copy?

893
00:57:04.897 --> 00:57:06.196
Scavenger.

894
00:57:06.265 --> 00:57:08.024
We just lost both payloads!

895
00:57:08.093 --> 00:57:10.894
I repeat!
We just lost both payloads!

896
00:57:10.963 --> 00:57:14.036
-No!
-We've lost the payloads?

897
00:57:14.105 --> 00:57:15.971
Affirmative.

898
00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.403
We've already dispatched two
Chinooks with similar payloads.

899
00:57:18.472 --> 00:57:19.706
ETA three hours.

900
00:57:19.775 --> 00:57:22.371
We don't have
three hours. Major!

901
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.847
Dr. Hughes. we can't get
that ordnance here any sooner.

902
00:57:24.916 --> 00:57:27.145
It's coming by helicopter off
a carrier out in the Atlantic.

903
00:57:27.213 --> 00:57:30.284
No! That won't do!
We have to do something now!

904
00:57:30.352 --> 00:57:31.986
Zeus. stand by.

905
00:57:32.055 --> 00:57:34.717
You said that that airfield has
helicopters and ordnance. right?

906
00:57:34.786 --> 00:57:36.489
-Yes.
-Okay.

907
00:57:36.558 --> 00:57:38.328
Then we handle this right now!

908
00:57:38.397 --> 00:57:40.796
-Scavenger!
-Zeus. Scavenger.

909
00:57:40.865 --> 00:57:42.993
We're going to explore
possible options on our end.

910
00:57:43.062 --> 00:57:44.665
We'll keep you apprised.
Scavenger out.

911
00:57:44.733 --> 00:57:46.935
Okay. let's go.
And stay low.

912
00:58:04.284 --> 00:58:06.216
Run!

913
00:58:16.061 --> 00:58:17.793
-Hey. you guys okay?
-Yep.

914
00:58:17.862 --> 00:58:19.597
I think we're safe.

915
00:58:19.665 --> 00:58:20.967
That was close.

916
00:58:28.046 --> 00:58:30.745
Hm. There's no guarantee any
of these birds are operational.

917
00:58:30.814 --> 00:58:34.014
but there's a Bell Huey
and a Chinook.

918
00:58:34.082 --> 00:58:36.180
-Great.
-Wait. You can can
fly helicopters?

919
00:58:36.248 --> 00:58:38.283
It won't be a smooth ride.
but we'll manage.

920
00:58:38.352 --> 00:58:40.857
She'll definitely struggle
to gain lift with this heat.

921
00:58:40.925 --> 00:58:43.886
providing I can find ordnance
big enough to do the job.

922
00:58:43.955 --> 00:58:45.793
If we can get that helicopter.

923
00:58:45.862 --> 00:58:47.896
I have some hygroscopic
flares in my bag.

924
00:58:47.964 --> 00:58:50.599
It might temporarily disperse
the warm clouds

925
00:58:50.668 --> 00:58:53.164
and give the helicopter
some lift.

926
00:58:53.233 --> 00:58:56.806
Hey. if I go up. I can
dispense more acridum.

927
00:58:56.875 --> 00:58:58.605
Keep the locust swarms
from choking up the engines

928
00:58:58.674 --> 00:59:00.875
so you guys can carry the bombs!

929
00:59:00.944 --> 00:59:03.640
Check out the Huey.
I'll take the Chinook.

930
00:59:03.708 --> 00:59:05.510
Copy that.

931
00:59:05.578 --> 00:59:07.211
Stay here.

932
00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.319
When the Lieutenant gives you
the signal.

933
00:59:09.388 --> 00:59:10.951
Dr. Rodney and Lenna. you move.

934
00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:13.422
Get up in the air.
do what you need to do.

935
00:59:13.491 --> 00:59:15.523
Dr. Hughes. you're with me.

936
00:59:15.592 --> 00:59:16.886
We're gonna take the Chinook.

937
00:59:16.955 --> 00:59:19.190
And do what we need to do.

938
00:59:21.693 --> 00:59:23.326
Good luck.

939
00:59:42.614 --> 00:59:44.351
Come on.

940
00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:45.715
Careful. careful.

941
00:59:45.784 --> 00:59:48.054
Come on. come on.

942
01:01:24.649 --> 01:01:27.221
That should be enough
firepower to get the job done.

943
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:29.953
Okay. I'm gonna use that loader
to get the ordnance

944
01:01:30.021 --> 01:01:31.019
loaded up on the Chinook.

945
01:01:31.088 --> 01:01:33.060
Stay put this time.

946
01:01:41.703 --> 01:01:43.807
Come on. Dakota. come on.

947
01:01:46.276 --> 01:01:47.305
Come on!

948
01:01:50.315 --> 01:01:52.211
Dakota. come on!

949
01:01:53.981 --> 01:01:55.645
We're in!
Go. go. go. go!

950
01:01:55.714 --> 01:01:56.984
Hang on!

951
01:01:57.053 --> 01:01:58.749
This is gonna be rough
with these winds!

952
01:01:58.817 --> 01:02:00.516
Copy that!

953
01:02:13.733 --> 01:02:15.271
Whoa!

954
01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.703
Very rough. okay?

955
01:02:16.772 --> 01:02:19.139
Yeah. yeah. yeah. okay.

956
01:02:33.554 --> 01:02:35.289
Hang on!

957
01:02:35.358 --> 01:02:37.452
We're gonna go down if we don't
do something about these bugs!

958
01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:40.095
Ooh. ooh.
I'm gonna try out my concoction!

959
01:02:40.164 --> 01:02:41.560
-Okay. sounds like a plan!
-I'm gonna try right now!

960
01:02:41.629 --> 01:02:42.899
Okay.

961
01:02:44.034 --> 01:02:45.027
When you get a chance.
hold open the door

962
01:02:45.096 --> 01:02:46.395
so I can drop the flare.

963
01:02:46.464 --> 01:02:48.201
Yeah. Okay.
Just give me a second.

964
01:02:51.441 --> 01:02:52.709
Whoa!

965
01:02:52.778 --> 01:02:54.007
These things are getting
in the turbines!

966
01:02:54.076 --> 01:02:56.814
No time for this.
Give me your flare!

967
01:02:58.012 --> 01:02:59.243
Are you gonna put them together

968
01:02:59.312 --> 01:03:00.649
and kill two birds
with one stone?

969
01:03:00.718 --> 01:03:02.083
-Yep.
-That's genius.

970
01:03:02.152 --> 01:03:03.379
It'll clear the skies
with the cloud seed

971
01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:05.750
and it'll disperse
all the locusts!

972
01:03:05.819 --> 01:03:06.784
That's the idea.

973
01:03:06.853 --> 01:03:08.087
Okay. great.

974
01:03:08.156 --> 01:03:09.185
Wait. how are
we gonna light that?

975
01:03:09.254 --> 01:03:10.686
Same way as we did last time.

976
01:03:10.754 --> 01:03:12.995
Yes. but the Lieutenant
is flying the helicopter!

977
01:03:13.063 --> 01:03:15.395
-How is he gonna shoot?
-Good question.

978
01:03:15.464 --> 01:03:16.998
Lieutenant. does this thing
have an autopilot function?

979
01:03:17.067 --> 01:03:20.035
Negative!
This is Vietnam era equipment!

980
01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.608
Okay.
I guess I'll take the shot.

981
01:03:26.676 --> 01:03:27.942
Do you know how to shoot?

982
01:03:28.011 --> 01:03:29.179
I used to go plinking
with my dad.

983
01:03:29.248 --> 01:03:30.607
Okay.

984
01:03:30.676 --> 01:03:31.844
That was with his .22 and
my BB gun. but that's okay.

985
01:03:31.912 --> 01:03:33.312
I'm gonna give it a shot.

986
01:03:33.381 --> 01:03:35.415
Lieutenant. can I use
your rifle. please?

987
01:03:35.484 --> 01:03:37.019
Take it!

988
01:03:37.751 --> 01:03:38.685
Okay.

989
01:03:38.754 --> 01:03:40.685
O-kay! That's a big boy.

990
01:03:40.754 --> 01:03:42.288
Okay.

991
01:03:42.356 --> 01:03:44.423
I need advice on how
to shoot a canister

992
01:03:44.492 --> 01:03:45.955
out a moving helicopter into
a swarm of angry locusts

993
01:03:46.024 --> 01:03:47.862
and lightning.

994
01:03:47.931 --> 01:03:48.894
Push the selector
button to "full"

995
01:03:48.963 --> 01:03:50.428
and make sure you lead it.

996
01:03:50.497 --> 01:03:52.398
Lead it. okay.
And when you say "lead it".

997
01:03:52.467 --> 01:03:53.864
you mean with the barrel
in front of the target. right?

998
01:03:53.933 --> 01:03:55.200
Affirmative!

999
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:56.540
On full auto. you wanna
lead it by

1000
01:03:56.609 --> 01:03:58.105
about two feet below to be safe!

1001
01:03:58.174 --> 01:03:59.773
On full auto. the rifle's
gonna tilt up

1002
01:03:59.842 --> 01:04:01.372
when you pull the trigger!

1003
01:04:01.441 --> 01:04:03.107
-Okay. sensible enough.
-Yeah. yeah.

1004
01:04:03.176 --> 01:04:04.779
Okay. here we go.
On three.

1005
01:04:04.848 --> 01:04:08.184
-Okay.
-One. two. three!

1006
01:04:12.389 --> 01:04:13.990
Ah!

1007
01:04:14.787 --> 01:04:16.091
Oh!

1008
01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:20.297
-I did it!
-You did it!

1009
01:04:20.366 --> 01:04:21.932
You did it!

1010
01:04:26.497 --> 01:04:29.372
It's not working.
Oh. it's not...

1011
01:04:29.441 --> 01:04:31.469
It's not working!

1012
01:04:35.443 --> 01:04:37.477
These things are getting
into the turbine engines!

1013
01:04:37.546 --> 01:04:40.412
I'm gonna have to put this
thing down before we crash!

1014
01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.746
Go. go. go!
Take it down! Take it down!

1015
01:04:41.815 --> 01:04:43.250
Go. go!

1016
01:04:45.291 --> 01:04:46.924
Whoa!

1017
01:04:51.461 --> 01:04:52.490
Oh!

1018
01:04:57.095 --> 01:04:58.529
Lieutenant!

1019
01:05:09.342 --> 01:05:11.344
-Is everybody okay?
-Yeah.

1020
01:05:12.782 --> 01:05:14.945
What are we gonna do?

1021
01:05:15.014 --> 01:05:16.013
I don't know.

1022
01:05:16.082 --> 01:05:17.415
I don't understand.

1023
01:05:17.484 --> 01:05:19.655
The acridum didn't
kill these things.

1024
01:05:19.724 --> 01:05:22.720
Maybe the Hygroscopic aerosols

1025
01:05:22.788 --> 01:05:25.257
didn't-- dampened the
effectiveness of the acridum?

1026
01:05:25.326 --> 01:05:26.892
Of the acridum!
Yes. that's it!

1027
01:05:26.961 --> 01:05:28.398
Do you have another one?

1028
01:05:28.467 --> 01:05:29.659
I have one more.

1029
01:05:29.727 --> 01:05:33.601
The one that worked
the last time. so...

1030
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:35.866
Okay. okay.

1031
01:05:35.935 --> 01:05:36.934
Here.

1032
01:05:37.003 --> 01:05:38.438
Lieutenant?

1033
01:05:38.506 --> 01:05:41.405
Lieutenant. you take the shot.
You throw the canister.

1034
01:05:41.474 --> 01:05:43.240
-Okay. Copy.
-I'll open the door.

1035
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:44.273
-We got this.
-Yeah.

1036
01:05:44.342 --> 01:05:48.183
Ready?
One. two. three!

1037
01:05:57.390 --> 01:06:00.395
It's working?
It's working!

1038
01:06:00.464 --> 01:06:02.494
Hey!

1039
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:06.394
Major Jones. the locust
swarms have been dispersed.

1040
01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:07.966
You are clear for takeoff.

1041
01:06:08.034 --> 01:06:09.469
Copy. Sergeant.

1042
01:06:09.537 --> 01:06:12.007
Dakota? Elliot? Thank you
for your work up there.

1043
01:06:12.076 --> 01:06:14.638
All right. here we go.
Hold on. Lynise.

1044
01:06:14.706 --> 01:06:16.305
I should be able to connect
to the satellite

1045
01:06:16.374 --> 01:06:17.911
using the Chinook systems.

1046
01:06:17.979 --> 01:06:19.412
I'm getting a signal!

1047
01:06:19.481 --> 01:06:21.513
It's weak. but it's
gonna get the job done!

1048
01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:27.121
Okay. I got the coordinates.

1049
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:29.324
Go to the north shore
of the lake.

1050
01:06:29.392 --> 01:06:35.392
You're going to 10.7339 Sierra
by 37.5681 Whiskey.

1051
01:06:35.461 --> 01:06:38.398
Copy.
Adjusting accordingly.

1052
01:07:12.804 --> 01:07:14.170
The world is coming to an end.

1053
01:07:18.373 --> 01:07:20.638
Don't count our
team out just yet.

1054
01:07:21.613 --> 01:07:23.311
Yes. ma'am.

1055
01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:35.191
Major. are you all right?

1056
01:07:38.192 --> 01:07:40.061
Major. did you hear me?

1057
01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:42.858
I heard a voice.
Like thunder.

1058
01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:45.762
Major?

1059
01:07:46.936 --> 01:07:48.864
"Come". it cried out.

1060
01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:57.642
Major!
Where are you taking us?

1061
01:07:57.711 --> 01:08:00.777
To Sergipe! We will open
the Seventh Seal. doctor!

1062
01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:09.753
Major! I need you to turn
the helicopter back around!

1063
01:08:16.331 --> 01:08:18.934
I saw before me
a white horse.

1064
01:08:19.003 --> 01:08:21.299
its rider armed with a bow.

1065
01:08:21.368 --> 01:08:23.866
an adorning crown upon his head.

1066
01:08:26.277 --> 01:08:30.543
Behold the second horse...
fiery red!

1067
01:08:31.546 --> 01:08:34.476
Its rider armed
with a mighty sword

1068
01:08:34.545 --> 01:08:36.747
to strike down my enemies.

1069
01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:43.285
Major. I've got
something for you.

1070
01:08:43.354 --> 01:08:44.858
The third horse!

1071
01:08:44.927 --> 01:08:46.293
A black one!

1072
01:08:46.362 --> 01:08:50.364
Its rider baring
the scales of justice...

1073
01:08:50.433 --> 01:08:53.297
Justice and punishment
to my enemies.

1074
01:08:53.365 --> 01:08:56.369
Major. please. take this.

1075
01:08:56.437 --> 01:08:58.538
it's going to make
you feel better.

1076
01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:02.237
Please.

1077
01:09:02.306 --> 01:09:04.280
Behold.

1078
01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.483
A pale horse emerged...

1079
01:09:14.826 --> 01:09:18.789
And death was its rider.

1080
01:09:26.497 --> 01:09:28.865
And all hell followed!

1081
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:36.774
Major! It's me!
It's Lynise! Please!

1082
01:09:41.115 --> 01:09:42.844
Major. please!

1083
01:09:42.913 --> 01:09:45.881
Don't worry. doctor.
No need to worry.

1084
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:47.989
I'm pulling
the cold air out there.

1085
01:09:48.058 --> 01:09:51.992
Major. tell me about...

1086
01:09:52.061 --> 01:09:54.396
tell me about Joseph

1087
01:09:54.464 --> 01:09:57.399
when he finally revealed
himself to his brothers!

1088
01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.467
What did Joseph do?

1089
01:10:03.536 --> 01:10:05.039
After the terrible injustice

1090
01:10:05.108 --> 01:10:06.336
done to him by his brothers...

1091
01:10:06.405 --> 01:10:08.344
What did Joseph do?

1092
01:10:10.078 --> 01:10:11.842
What did he do?

1093
01:10:16.613 --> 01:10:19.553
He offered forgiveness...

1094
01:10:20.856 --> 01:10:23.352
Yes!

1095
01:10:23.421 --> 01:10:28.690
Genesis- 20.

1096
01:10:28.759 --> 01:10:32.200
"You intended to cause me harm.

1097
01:10:32.269 --> 01:10:34.295
but God intended
it all for good."

1098
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:48.650
I need you to breathe this in!

1099
01:10:48.719 --> 01:10:49.546
Breathe!

1100
01:10:49.615 --> 01:10:50.751
The oxygen will kill the fungus!

1101
01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:51.714
Breathe!

1102
01:10:51.782 --> 01:10:55.190
No!
Breathe. please breathe!

1103
01:10:55.259 --> 01:10:57.526
There you go.
there you go.

1104
01:10:57.594 --> 01:11:00.726
There you go.
Keep breathing. keep breathing.

1105
01:11:04.034 --> 01:11:05.932
Good. Major. good.

1106
01:11:06.001 --> 01:11:07.337
Okay.

1107
01:11:08.103 --> 01:11:10.335
Now I need this.

1108
01:11:10.403 --> 01:11:12.342
Keep breathing. Major.

1109
01:11:15.639 --> 01:11:17.842
General. this is Lynise!

1110
01:11:19.178 --> 01:11:21.944
Dr. Hughes. where is the Major?
What's happening there?

1111
01:11:22.013 --> 01:11:23.782
The Major was infected
by the fungus.

1112
01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:25.320
I was able to clear
it out of his system

1113
01:11:25.389 --> 01:11:26.818
with the oxygen
from a respirator.

1114
01:11:26.887 --> 01:11:28.851
Listen. I don't have
time to explain all that.

1115
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.191
Can you find us
on your satellite?

1116
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:33.156
We're in a Chinook helicopter.

1117
01:11:33.225 --> 01:11:39.628
Our coordinates are 10.7739
Sierra by 37.5861 Whiskey.

1118
01:11:39.697 --> 01:11:41.330
Are you over Lago Do Fodo?

1119
01:11:41.399 --> 01:11:42.634
Yes. yes.

1120
01:11:42.703 --> 01:11:44.506
We have a huge bomb
from the airport.

1121
01:11:44.575 --> 01:11:46.069
And we're gonna drop it
over the epicenter

1122
01:11:46.138 --> 01:11:48.510
because the ordnance isn't
gonna get here in time.

1123
01:11:48.579 --> 01:11:51.140
The Major has promised me
it's going to work.

1124
01:11:51.209 --> 01:11:53.779
But I still need you to use
the infrared satellite

1125
01:11:53.848 --> 01:11:56.115
and guide us directly
over the epicenter.

1126
01:11:56.184 --> 01:11:57.217
Can you do that?

1127
01:11:57.286 --> 01:11:59.015
Absolutely.
Stand by.

1128
01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:01.985
Okay.

1129
01:12:04.756 --> 01:12:06.525
Let me get in there. doctor.

1130
01:12:06.594 --> 01:12:09.025
-Let me in there.
-Okay. okay.

1131
01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:14.366
The General is
gonna guide us

1132
01:12:14.435 --> 01:12:16.065
to the epicenter. okay?

1133
01:12:17.571 --> 01:12:18.973
Who's flying the helicopter?

1134
01:12:19.042 --> 01:12:20.577
The Major is now.

1135
01:12:20.645 --> 01:12:23.610
Good. Glad to hear that oxygen
is an effective antidote.

1136
01:12:23.679 --> 01:12:25.614
We have eyes on
the epicenter. Major.

1137
01:12:25.682 --> 01:12:28.945
I want you to take
a heading out in vector 4.7.

1138
01:12:29.014 --> 01:12:30.850
I've lost access
to my guidance systems.

1139
01:12:30.918 --> 01:12:33.416
I'll need you to direct me
with landmarks. General.

1140
01:12:33.484 --> 01:12:35.051
Copy that.

1141
01:12:35.119 --> 01:12:38.225
I need you to reduce
your speed to 160 knots.

1142
01:12:38.294 --> 01:12:40.463
Target is to your- 00.

1143
01:12:41.662 --> 01:12:43.994
Copy.
Adjusting coordinates.

1144
01:12:48.068 --> 01:12:51.837
You're 55 meters on target.
Stay on that heading.

1145
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:56.204
Gasses are rising
to the surface.

1146
01:12:56.273 --> 01:12:58.613
It's getting ready to
blow any minute now!

1147
01:12:58.681 --> 01:13:00.647
Okay. You're directly over
the epicenter.

1148
01:13:00.716 --> 01:13:02.144
Push yourself into
a holding pattern.

1149
01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:05.048
drop your ordnance
and get out of there!

1150
01:13:08.286 --> 01:13:11.191
Confirm holding pattern.
preparing to drop ordnance.

1151
01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:13.023
Engaging autopilot.

1152
01:13:16.094 --> 01:13:21.268
Doctor. there's a switch.
a release switch.

1153
01:13:21.336 --> 01:13:23.501
behind the door there.

1154
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:27.076
Turn the top dial first

1155
01:13:27.145 --> 01:13:29.939
and the second dial after.

1156
01:13:30.008 --> 01:13:32.748
-That'll release the bomb.
-Okay.

1157
01:13:32.817 --> 01:13:33.978
Top.

1158
01:13:37.252 --> 01:13:39.456
First. and sec--

1159
01:13:41.222 --> 01:13:42.954
Um...

1160
01:13:46.359 --> 01:13:47.491
I'm sorry.

1161
01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.159
What? What happened?

1162
01:13:49.228 --> 01:13:52.133
Mechanical failure.
a loss of hydraulic pressure.

1163
01:13:52.202 --> 01:13:53.501
Okay. but what do we do?

1164
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:56.402
Must be a leak.
There's nothing...

1165
01:13:56.471 --> 01:13:58.941
There's nothing to do. doctor.

1166
01:13:59.009 --> 01:13:59.834
It's over.

1167
01:13:59.903 --> 01:14:02.643
Well. can't we cut the cables?

1168
01:14:02.712 --> 01:14:05.042
You can't cut
those cables. doctor.

1169
01:14:05.111 --> 01:14:06.842
They're holding up an
8.000 kilogram bomb.

1170
01:14:06.911 --> 01:14:08.683
They're not made out of string.

1171
01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.919
What's happening. Major?

1172
01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:19.925
Sorry. doctor...
I'm not feeling well.

1173
01:14:27.103 --> 01:14:28.131
Okay.

1174
01:14:31.272 --> 01:14:32.501
Major?

1175
01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:34.843
Major?

1176
01:14:34.911 --> 01:14:39.076
Major. I'm gonna crash
the helicopter into the lake.

1177
01:14:41.186 --> 01:14:42.882
There's no greater love

1178
01:14:42.951 --> 01:14:45.181
than to lay your life
down for your brother.

1179
01:14:46.156 --> 01:14:47.183
I like that.

1180
01:14:49.261 --> 01:14:52.420
General?
This is Lynise.

1181
01:14:52.489 --> 01:14:55.693
The other payload should be
there within three hours.

1182
01:14:55.762 --> 01:14:57.895
General. there is no time left.

1183
01:14:57.963 --> 01:14:59.931
Is there any way
to fix this lever?

1184
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.431
It could be
several things. doctor.

1185
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:06.174
He said it's something with the
hydraulics. loss of fluid maybe.

1186
01:15:06.243 --> 01:15:07.542
That can't be fixed.

1187
01:15:07.611 --> 01:15:09.676
You need to have
the helicopter grounded.

1188
01:15:09.744 --> 01:15:11.207
I'm not going down
without a fight.

1189
01:15:11.276 --> 01:15:13.412
We're gonna crash
the helicopter into the lake.

1190
01:15:13.481 --> 01:15:14.913
You're gonna what?

1191
01:15:14.982 --> 01:15:17.016
We're going to crash
the helicopter!

1192
01:15:17.085 --> 01:15:18.752
That won't work. doctor.
The firing mechanism won't--

1193
01:15:18.821 --> 01:15:21.621
The firing mechanism
is heat activated.

1194
01:15:21.690 --> 01:15:23.892
Hold on!
Don't do anything rash!

1195
01:15:23.961 --> 01:15:25.628
As long as the helicopter makes
contact with the magma chamber.

1196
01:15:25.697 --> 01:15:27.657
the heat from the volcano
should be high enough

1197
01:15:27.726 --> 01:15:29.495
to trigger the bomb.

1198
01:15:29.564 --> 01:15:31.799
It's our only option. General.

1199
01:15:43.078 --> 01:15:47.943
Okay. Major. tell me about
one of your best memories.

1200
01:15:48.012 --> 01:15:50.051
maybe something about church?

1201
01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.249
My mom...

1202
01:15:52.318 --> 01:15:55.885
I used to love going to church
each Sunday with my mom.

1203
01:15:55.954 --> 01:15:57.556
Oh. good.
That sounds nice.

1204
01:15:57.624 --> 01:15:59.561
Tell me what it was like.

1205
01:15:59.629 --> 01:16:02.929
I had to
pass the collection plate.

1206
01:16:03.761 --> 01:16:05.300
I dropped it.

1207
01:16:05.368 --> 01:16:07.670
She said it was okay.

1208
01:16:08.833 --> 01:16:10.199
What happened then?

1209
01:16:10.268 --> 01:16:13.841
She went under the pews
to get the money.

1210
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:17.373
She told me it wasn't my fault.

1211
01:16:17.442 --> 01:16:20.342
Oh. that was so nice of her.
really nice of her.

1212
01:16:23.354 --> 01:16:24.852
Okay.
Okay. Major.

1213
01:16:24.921 --> 01:16:28.156
Major. look. it's gonna
be all right. okay?

1214
01:16:28.224 --> 01:16:29.824
I got you.

1215
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.158
Look!

1216
01:16:36.631 --> 01:16:38.230
We have to go get them!

1217
01:16:38.299 --> 01:16:39.667
Will they even be alive because
of the volcanic fumes?

1218
01:16:39.735 --> 01:16:40.965
Isn't that water
extremely caustic?

1219
01:16:41.034 --> 01:16:43.299
No. no. no!
The lake is alkaline.

1220
01:16:43.368 --> 01:16:45.601
The limestone neutralizes
the volcanic acids.

1221
01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:47.637
There!

1222
01:16:47.706 --> 01:16:49.073
Affirmative!

1223
01:16:49.142 --> 01:16:51.073
Scavenger. we have
two heat signatures.

1224
01:16:51.142 --> 01:16:52.815
It looks like they're
moving to

1225
01:16:52.884 --> 01:16:54.915
the north-eastern shoreline
headed straight for you!

1226
01:16:58.616 --> 01:17:00.119
Come on!

1227
01:17:00.187 --> 01:17:02.951
Hey. you guys. over here!
Help me get Oakley out!

1228
01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:04.386
I got you. Major. come on!

1229
01:17:04.455 --> 01:17:07.191
Major. major. major.
come here. come here.

1230
01:17:08.593 --> 01:17:09.864
Come on!

1231
01:17:11.301 --> 01:17:12.933
Come on. big guy!

1232
01:17:13.867 --> 01:17:15.667
Hey. what happened to the bomb?

1233
01:17:15.735 --> 01:17:17.137
Why didn't it go off?

1234
01:17:17.206 --> 01:17:19.036
Come on.

1235
01:17:19.105 --> 01:17:21.574
That ordnance...
it has a supersonic

1236
01:17:21.643 --> 01:17:23.372
impact casing in the head.

1237
01:17:23.441 --> 01:17:25.010
It won't blow until it
reaches temperature

1238
01:17:25.079 --> 01:17:26.415
from the heat inside
the magma chamber.

1239
01:17:26.484 --> 01:17:27.415
We have to get out of here!

1240
01:17:27.483 --> 01:17:29.818
-Let's go!
-Go. go!

1241
01:17:35.018 --> 01:17:36.618
We've got them. Zeus!

1242
01:17:36.687 --> 01:17:39.696
We have all thee guests and
Major Jones in possession!

1243
01:17:40.628 --> 01:17:42.292
Get to safety now!

1244
01:18:18.302 --> 01:18:19.399
I can't breathe.

1245
01:18:19.468 --> 01:18:21.431
That's normal.

1246
01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.365
Ordinance sucks the oxygen
right out of your lungs

1247
01:18:23.434 --> 01:18:25.401
when you're this close
to detonation.

1248
01:18:27.344 --> 01:18:28.474
Did we do it?

1249
01:18:28.543 --> 01:18:29.779
I can't tell yet.

1250
01:18:39.455 --> 01:18:41.685
General. look.

1251
01:18:41.754 --> 01:18:42.990
The monitor!

1252
01:18:54.031 --> 01:18:55.332
It looks like it worked.

1253
01:18:57.408 --> 01:18:58.901
It looks like it worked!

1254
01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:00.638
Yes. it did. ma'am!

1255
01:19:03.139 --> 01:19:04.880
Nice work. soldier.

1256
01:19:06.382 --> 01:19:07.779
Scavenger.

1257
01:19:07.848 --> 01:19:09.177
Scavenger. do you read me?

1258
01:19:09.246 --> 01:19:11.419
Please tell me you're okay.

1259
01:19:11.488 --> 01:19:13.284
Scavenger. come in.

1260
01:19:14.819 --> 01:19:16.291
Scavenger.

1261
01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.727
Oh. thank God.

1262
01:19:17.796 --> 01:19:20.190
I am looking at
feed all over the globe.

1263
01:19:20.258 --> 01:19:23.091
And it seems like
you stopped it!

1264
01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:25.032
Excellent news. Zeus.

1265
01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.265
I'd like to speak to
Dr. Hughes if I may.

1266
01:19:30.268 --> 01:19:33.104
General Norris...
I mean. Zeus.

1267
01:19:33.173 --> 01:19:35.103
No need for mil spec
talk. doctor.

1268
01:19:35.172 --> 01:19:37.480
This is a secured line.

1269
01:19:37.549 --> 01:19:39.147
We are getting satellite imagery

1270
01:19:39.216 --> 01:19:43.549
that shows the entire chain
reaction is shutting down.

1271
01:19:43.617 --> 01:19:45.986
All right!

1272
01:19:46.055 --> 01:19:47.955
The storm systems
appear to be clearing.

1273
01:19:48.024 --> 01:19:50.019
The locust swarms appear
to be dropping off

1274
01:19:50.087 --> 01:19:52.225
at a substantial rate.

1275
01:19:52.293 --> 01:19:55.764
And it looks as though
the geothermal readings

1276
01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:57.929
are dropping rapidly
at Lago Do Fodo.

1277
01:19:57.998 --> 01:20:00.133
Great to hear that. General.

1278
01:20:00.201 --> 01:20:01.898
And what of the
infection you spoke of?

1279
01:20:01.967 --> 01:20:03.534
Regarding the fungi?

1280
01:20:03.603 --> 01:20:06.271
General. I'm gonna let
Dr. Rodney fill you in on that.

1281
01:20:08.372 --> 01:20:13.476
Hello. Hi.
Elliot Rodney here.

1282
01:20:15.653 --> 01:20:17.412
It's our respiratory systems.

1283
01:20:17.481 --> 01:20:19.153
As soon as I get back
to my labs.

1284
01:20:19.222 --> 01:20:22.158
I can synthesize a compound
that we can release

1285
01:20:22.227 --> 01:20:25.288
in aerosol form so we can spread
it through the locust swarms.

1286
01:20:25.357 --> 01:20:27.524
It'll also spread
from human to human.

1287
01:20:27.592 --> 01:20:30.128
neutralizing the neural
effect of the fungus.

1288
01:20:30.197 --> 01:20:33.133
Outstanding. Dr. Rodney.
outstanding.

1289
01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:37.005
You wanna say something?
We all did our part.

1290
01:20:38.271 --> 01:20:40.842
General. this is
Dakota Lenna speaking.

1291
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:42.538
Good to hear your voice.
Dr. Lenna.

1292
01:20:42.606 --> 01:20:44.344
The cloud seeding worked
exactly as planned.

1293
01:20:44.412 --> 01:20:47.179
With the immense rush of
cooler air from the atmosphere.

1294
01:20:47.248 --> 01:20:49.716
we'll soon be
stabilize weather systems

1295
01:20:49.784 --> 01:20:51.284
along the jet stream.

1296
01:20:51.353 --> 01:20:54.121
I'm watching it happen
via satellite as we speak.

1297
01:20:54.190 --> 01:20:57.124
Excellent work from all of you!
Thank you!

1298
01:20:57.193 --> 01:20:59.187
You've all done
the world a great service.

1299
01:20:59.256 --> 01:21:00.890
Just doing our job. ma'am.

1300
01:21:03.133 --> 01:21:06.197
General. we're getting
calls from all over.

1301
01:21:06.265 --> 01:21:08.400
They want to speak
with you. ma'am.

1302
01:21:08.469 --> 01:21:11.739
Everyone. I've got a few
people that I need to talk to.

1303
01:21:11.808 --> 01:21:13.709
We can converse a little later.

1304
01:21:13.778 --> 01:21:17.373
Copy that. Zeus.
Scavenger out.

1305
01:21:17.441 --> 01:21:20.983
You guys. we did it!
We did it!

1306
01:21:22.047 --> 01:21:23.685
Let's not do it again.

1307
01:21:23.754 --> 01:21:26.916
-We did it!
-Good job!

1308
01:21:37.764 --> 01:21:40.266
Yeah!

1309
01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:45.040
Come on.

1310
01:21:45.974 --> 01:21:50.078
Lynise. I owe you an apology.

1311
01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.645
No apology necessary. Major.

1312
01:21:52.714 --> 01:21:54.944
All is forgiven.

1313
01:21:55.012 --> 01:21:58.053
Thank you.
