of him?

-Of NoelLover12?

-Yeah.

12
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.740
-I think his choice
of profile name

13
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.241
suggests questionable
decision-making skills.

14
00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.368

loves Christmas?

We need money.

-Instead of asking to have
never been born.

38
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.672
why didn't George Bailey
just ask for a redo on life?

39
00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:30.423
So he could live the life
he always wanted.

40
00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.133
-Because that's the whole point.

41
00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.094

the entire time.

Well. I think if I could do it
all over again.

52
00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:57.492
I wouldn't change a thing.

I will not feel bad for making
you go home for the holidays.

58

be your best friend?

for the holidays vacation?

Why can't we take your mom
to Hawaii this Christmas

93
00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.104

94
00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.772
-Because she asked for
Christmas in Weston this year.

95
00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.941
-There's this crazy new concept
called saying no.

96
00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:55.610
-I know. but we both know
I cannot say no to my mom.

97
00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.362
I mean. ever since my dad passed
it's just the two of us

98
00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:58.655
and I want her to be happy.

99
00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:00.240
-I know. and you have
the biggest heart.

100
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:01.950
but your dad passed
17 years ago

101
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.243
and while grief isn't linear

102
00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:04.536
I think it's time to set
some boundaries.

103
00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:05.453
-I know.

104
00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.329

Setting boundaries with my mom

106
00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.374

-Well. why wait?
Call her and say aloha.

108
00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.961

it's a little late for that.

109
00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.004
But you're right.

110
00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.130
If I don't start now.

111
00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.339
I'll probably just keep
skirting it.

112
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.591
So... this Christmas
and forever more.

113
00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.677
I will set boundaries
with my mother.

114
00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.053
-And I support you
in doing them.

115
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:22.929
-Mm-hmm.

116
00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.431
-What?

117
00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:25.098
-You could set some boundaries
of your own.

118
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.099
-Such as?

119
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:27.434
-Not fighting with your mom.

120

with you two.

-[sighs] I know.

So this Hanukkah you will
not fight with your mother.

with my mother.

by my mom's. Yeah?

-I'm gonna need some serious
caffeination before we do that.

-Mm-hmm.

135
00:04:58.506 --> 00:04:59.758
So do you think we'll
bump into anyone we know

136
00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:00.800
while we're home?

137
00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.177
-I don't know.

138
00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.054
Anyone in particular
you wanna bump into?

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.430

-Chris Silver!

141
00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:08.725
You know. I haven't thought
about him in years.

142
00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:10.602
-I'm sure.

143
00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.354
Maybe this trip will have
a silver lining.

144

-You know what though?

145
00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:14.731
I heard he lives in Chicago now.

146
00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:18.276

into him are zero.

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:16.418
-Shall we exchange numbers?

180
00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:17.293
-Yes. that would be great.
-No. no. no.

181
00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:18.795
-We'll just see you around town.

182
00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:19.295
-Oh. okay.

183
00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.046
-Yeah.

184
00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:21.464
-Sure.

185
00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:22.632
-Let's go.

186
00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:24.509
-Alright.

187
00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:25.635
-Yeah. Bye.
-Bye.

188
00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:26.845
-Bye.

189
00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.555
-What? Why didn't you wanna get
his number?

190
00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:30.056
-What. and just hang out
with Chris Silver?

191
00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.474
-Yeah. Why not?

192
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:33.935
-[chuckling awkwardly]

193
00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:34.602
-Cheers.

194
00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.897
-It is not fair that he didn't
peak in high school.

195
00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.316
-Definitely did not peak
in high school.

196
00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:41.234
-What's that?

197
00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:42.277
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

198
00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:43.111
Go. go.

199
00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:46.489
-Go. go. go. go.

200
00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.663
[cheerful music]

201
00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.463
-Maybe she got it out
of her system

202
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.256
-Hm.
-[door opens]

203
00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:04.799
-Who's ready for Christmas?

204
00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.554
-Linda. this looks beautiful.

205
00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.097
-Oh. it's a labor of love.

206
00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.726
I haven't been home for six
years for Christmas

207
00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.353
and so I brought all
the decorations out.

208
00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.480
-Yeah. we can see that.

209
00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:21.691
-And I have big plans
for our week together.

210
00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:24.235
Crafting. baking. caroling.
Christmas movies.

211
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.695
I recorded 40 of them.

212
00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:29.115
And I Google'd where we can buy
all the scarves.

213
00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.617
We can do that tonight!

214
00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:33.620
-Actually. Naomi was gonna
come to my mom's with me.

215
00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:35.622
It's the first night
of Hanukkah.

216
00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:37.707
-You just got here and
I made you a yule log.

217
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:39.167
And...

218
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:40.835
I've got a special surprise!

219
00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:43.380
-Would you mind Hanukkah
without me.

220
00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:44.673
-What happened to boundaries?

221
00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:45.840
-I know. but it's my first
night home

222
00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:46.883
she made me a yule log.
it's my favorite.

223
00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:47.967
Oh my...

224
00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.845
-Look! Now we're twinsies.

225
00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:51.638
-Oh...

226
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.473
[laughing awkwardly]

227
00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:56.142
-Liz. I got you one too.
Woohoo.

228
00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:58.144
-Yay! Triplets!

229
00:07:58.186 --> 00:07:59.854
-Aww. triplets.

230
00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.272
[Linda laughs]

231
00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.190
-[Naomi sighs]

232
00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.695
[peaceful music]

233
00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.366
-Happy Hanukkah.

234
00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:12.617
-Hi Mom.

235
00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:15.078
-You finally made it.

236
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.996
Where's Naomi?

237
00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:18.873
-She's at home with Linda
but she wants to see you soon.

238
00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:22.043
-Oh. how nice that Naomi
stayed home with her mom.

239
00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:24.337
I wish that you would stay home
with your mom and family.

240
00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.006
You should be sleeping here.

241
00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:27.757
-I would've if you hadn't turned
my room into your office.

242
00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:30.010
-Hello. hello!

243
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.344
-Hey Travis.

244
00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:33.054
-Hey kiddo. happy you're home.

245
00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:35.849
And congrats on The Wall Street
Journal write-up last week.

246
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.559
-Oh. it's not a write-up.
It's barely a blurb.

247
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.560
We're just trying
to stay relevant

248
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.061
as we lock down
Series B funding.

249
00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.313
-Whatever it was.
we're very proud.

250
00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.191
-Ah! There's my Jojo.

251
00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:48.069
How are you. how's it going?
Have you heard from Stanford?

252
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.697
-I heard from them on Monday
and. and I. uh... I got in.

253
00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:52.699
-[squeals]
Congratulations!

254
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:55.869
That's amazing.
Although I'm not surprised.

255
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.912
-Thanks. I couldn't have done it
without you.

256
00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:59.330
You taught me how to code.
you helped me with my essay.

257
00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.832
-Isn't this exciting?

258
00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:02.167
Now you two will live close

259
00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.377
and Travis and I will come visit
all the time.

260
00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:05.587
-That'll be great.

261
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:09.090
What's this?

262
00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:11.718
-Oh... it's our holiday card.

263
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.054
I decided to make it
a new tradition.

264
00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:15.930
-But I'm not in it.

265
00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:18.099
-Oh honey. I wanted a photo
of the four of us

266
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:21.269
but I don't have any recent
ones because you never visit.

267
00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.229
-Well. you could visit me
like you will all the time

268
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:24.606
when Jojo's there.

269
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:25.899
[deflated sighs]

270
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.902
-Hey! There's brisket!

271
00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:30.737
-Yes. honey. You made it.

272
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:33.990
-Good try. Travis.

273
00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.328
*

274
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.621
-Hi!

275
00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:40.497
How's Hanukkah?

276
00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:41.915
-Oh. you know.

277
00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:42.916
An entire year of family
dysfunction consolidated

278
00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.918
into one fun-filled night.

279
00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.294
-Eight fun-filled nights.

280
00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:47.754
-Thank you for the reminder.

281
00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.589
And you'll be happy to know
that I held the line

282
00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:50.757
and didn't fight with my mom.

283
00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:52.509
-I am happy. Mazel tov.

284
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.135
-How about you?

285
00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.845
How was the start of a lifetime
of boundaries with Linda?

286
00:09:58.181 --> 00:10:00.850
And because I know you so well
and I'm the best friend ever...

287
00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:03.395
-[gasps]
You are the best friend ever!

288
00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.021
[laughs]

289
00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:06.773
Ooh. now I hope we don't run
into anyone we know.

290
00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:08.358
-Oh. because we're
wearing these?

291
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.693
We absolutely will.

292
00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.862
[crowd in unison]
Merry Christmas!

293
00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:14.823
-See? No one we know.

294
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.827
-Oh... hi.

295
00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:22.330
-Hi. Twice in one day.
That's a good day.

296
00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:23.998
-What are the chances?

297
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.210
-It's the only bar in town.
so... hi.

298
00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.504
It's perfect timing.
Everybody just got here.

299
00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:30.588
Come say hi.

300
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.465
-No. That's okay.

301
00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:33.425
-You sure?

302
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.010
-Mm-hmm.

303
00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:36.177
-Everybody will be really
excited to see you.

304
00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:37.137
-See? Everyone will be
excited to see us.

305
00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:38.138
Come on. lets...

306
00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:38.847
-No. they won't.

307
00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:39.681
-Let's not be rude.

308
00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:40.682
-Is that a yes?
-Yeah.

309
00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:42.100
-Okay. come on.

310
00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:43.810
-Okay. Stop being-
-[awkward giggling]

311
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.233
-That is not playing it cool.

312
00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:51.151
-Come on.

-I never left.

331
00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.187
-I just moved back
a few years ago.

332
00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:28.938
-I'm in Chicago.

333
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.523
-I'm a Florida man now.

334
00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:32.067
-And I'm still here.

335
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.195
-Take a seat.
Let me take your jackets.

336

No!

-Okay.

338
00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:40.450
Keep 'em on.
Can I get you a drink maybe?

339
00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:41.326
-No. thank you.
-Yes!

340
00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:42.452
-We're actually heading out.

341
00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:43.370
-Are we?

342
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:44.371
-Aren't we?

343
00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.166
-Whatever you'd like to do.
we'd love to have you.

344
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.210
-Yes. we are going
to grab a drink

345
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:51.586

-Hi. Two eggnogs. please.

350
00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.135
-Are we really staying?

351
00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:00.428
We're gonna sit at
the cool kids' table.

352
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.097
-Yeah. why not?

353
00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.557
-Because we were invisible
to them in high school.

354
00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.059
-Yeah. but we're
celebrities now.

355
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:07.936
-I don't feel like a celebrity.

356
00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.646
I actually feel like I've been
transported back

357
00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:12.565
to my insecure 16-year-old self.

358
00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.192
Like I can feel the blackheads
brewing.

359
00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:15.485
-Well then it's a great
opportunity

360
00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:17.737
to lay insecure Liz to rest

361
00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:20.240
because we are
the cool kids now.

362
00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.118
-Make mine a double.

363
00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.623
-We are at three points down.
Ten seconds on the clock.

364
00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:32.085
I absolutely send it.
Wooooop! Skadoosh.

365
00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.212
It is right in the arms
of the Silver Bullet.

366
00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:37.382
the golden god on the field.
at the buzzer.

367
00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:41.177
Touchdown!
God! Beautiful!

368
00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:43.888
Uh. and that brings us to
the end of the first quarter.

369
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.890
-Ry. Ry. Ry. Ry. Ry. Ry...

370
00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.392
thank you for the trip
down memory lane.

371
00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.811
Let's leave some room for
our friends here. please.

372
00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:51.521
-No. That was...
that was interesting.

373
00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:52.439
-Thank you.

374
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.815
-Riveting.

375
00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:56.317
-But no. no. no.
You tell us about you.

376
00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:59.195
Um... what have you been up to
since high school?

377
00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.573
-Um... after high school
I joined the Marines.

378
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.283
-Awe...

379
00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.951
-My dad was a Marine so it
was kind of expected of me.

380
00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:06.786
But. um. I was deployed
three times

381
00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:08.913
and then I came back
to the States.

382
00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:11.624
Studied English at. uh...
Loyola.

383
00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:12.500
-Hm.

384
00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:14.419
-Interesting. Why?

385
00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:16.546
-I know. Liz. I really wasn't
the brightest. was I?

386
00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:17.797
-[chuckles]

387
00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:18.715
-Do you guys remember
Miss Jess?

388
00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:19.799
-Yeah.

389
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:20.675
-10th grade Lit.
-Mmhmm.

390
00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.093
-Yeah. she really inspired me.

391
00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.304
Bless a good teacher.
you know.

392
00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:26.848
And don't tell these guys
but. um...

393
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.641
I've always had delusions
of writing

394
00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:30.518
the great American novel.

395
00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.230
-I still have that delusion
and I can barely write an email.

396
00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:35.440
[all laugh]

397
00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:37.108
-Something tells me
that's not true. Liz.

398
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.276
It's pretty hot in here.

399
00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.277
you guys want to take your
coats off?

400
00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.070
-[in unison] No.

401
00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:45.325
-So. um... what else?
How did you end up back here?

402
00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:47.160
-Well. I stayed in Chicago a few
years and then I moved here

403
00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:50.205
and now I teach.
uh... English.

404
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.498
-Hmm.

405
00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:52.832
-At Columbia.

406
00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.542
-No way! You teach
at our old high school?

407
00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:56.211
That's amazing!

408
00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.046
-I mean. I'm the head of
the English department.

409
00:13:58.088 --> 00:13:59.589
-[in unison] Wow.

410
00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:00.757
-I finally got to see the inside
of a teacher's lounge.

411
00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.676
so that's... not very exciting.

412
00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:04.010
-[chuckles]
No. it is.

413
00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:06.179
-You guys are very exciting.

414
00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:08.640
I mean. congratulations
on all the success. Wow.

415
00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:10.016
How'd it all get going?

416
00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.559
-Well. we went to Iowa State.

417
00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:12.602
-Where we roomed together.

418
00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.145
-Mm-hmm.

419
00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:15.897
I majored in marketing.
minored in Spanish.

420
00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:17.899
-I majored in computer science.
minored in business

421
00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:19.359
and existential angst.

422
00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:21.027
-[chuckles]

423
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.029
And then. um. after we graduated
we moved to the Bay.

424
00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:25.699
Worked at a few tech start-ups.
got our feet wet.

425
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.825
-Literally got our feet wet.

426
00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.952
-[gasps]
Literally! That place.

427
00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.162
-What's the joke?

428
00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:36.459
-Oh. it's a long story with a
bad landlord and a bursted pipe.

429
00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:37.419
-You had to be there.

430
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.880
Anyway. five years later
we got some seed money

431
00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:42.382
and started Best Pal.

432
00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:44.134
-Mm-hmm.

433
00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.802
-It's incredible that you guys
have stayed working together

434
00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:46.553
all these years.

435
00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:47.679
-Yeah.

436
00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:49.180
-You're better than me.

437
00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:51.766
I can't imagine having
my best friend as my boss.

438
00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:55.228
-Um... I'm not her boss.
we're co-founders.

439
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.896
-Oh!

440
00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:57.981
-We built it together.
[nervous chuckle]

441
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.400
-Sorry.

442
00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:02.569
-Oh. it's... it's fine.
It's a common misconception.

443
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.362
[nervous chuckle]

444
00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.573
-Well why don't we. uh.
celebrate your success

445
00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.075
with a round of shots.
On Chris. of course.

446
00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.119
-Sure. why not.
-I second that.

447
00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:16.207
-[phone pings] Argh!
Ah. sorry. No. I gotta go.

448
00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:19.627
Teething baby won't sleep. so...
Babies have no boundaries.

449
00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:21.004
-And I should call it too.

450
00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:23.256
Another busy day at
the store tomorrow.

451
00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:25.967
-Uh. Chris. Are you still down
to split that ride share?

452
00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:28.845
-Oh yeah. sure. Okay.

453
00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:29.888
Look. it was really good
seeing you guys.

454
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:30.680
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

455
00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:31.431
-We'll do it again.

456
00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:32.974
-Yeah.

457
00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:34.142
-Some. uh. of our class
gets in tomorrow night

458
00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:36.644
and I'm having a bit
of a holiday party.

459
00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.104
Wine. appetizers.

460
00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:40.774
-All vegan so arrive
having eaten.

461
00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:42.776
-Chris is a very vocal vegan.

462
00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.611
-Is there any other kind?

463
00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:46.488
[indistinct chatter]

464
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.698
-Bye.
-Bye.

465
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.325
-Vegan pride aside.

466
00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:51.743
I would love to see
you guys tomorrow.

467
00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.120
-Yes. we will come by.

468
00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:55.705
-Maybe we'll come by.

469
00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:56.956
-Probably yes though.

470
00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:58.416
-Probably yes to a maybe.

471
00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.125
-Most likely yes.

472
00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.171
-That's very confusing.

473
00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:04.547
But I'm going to leave you guys
my number.

474
00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:05.090
I'll airdrop you.

475
00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:06.257
-Yeah. Great.

476
00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:07.008
-You guys can decide tomorrow.

477
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:07.801
[phone alerts pinging]

478
00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:08.510
-Got it.
-Got it?

479
00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:09.177
-Got it.

480
00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:11.971
-I got the check.
You guys get home safe.

481
00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.098
-Thank you.

482
00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:17.686
-What just happened?

483
00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:20.230
-It's the season of miracles.

484
00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.773
-Also. I'm sweating...

485
00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:22.899
-Ah. same.

486
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.234
-In this jacket.

487
00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:28.154
[cheerful music]

488
00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:29.531
[keyboard clacking]

489
00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:33.034
-Good morning.

490
00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:36.371
-Sorry. Did I wake you?

491
00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:38.748
-Yes.

492
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.835
-My bad.
How'd you sleep?

493
00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:44.254
-Always great. don't be jealous.

494
00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.840
Hey. any word from the VC firm?

495
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.341
-No. of course not.

496
00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:51.011
But dev ops sent me an email
of concerning length.

497
00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:53.179
-We're on vacation. remember?

498
00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:55.306
-No. I keep forgetting
this is a vacation.

499
00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:00.270
Oh! I forgot to tell you.
Jojo got into Stanford.

500
00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:01.855
-Oh. that's incredible.

501
00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:04.024
-Yeah. I know.
I'm so proud of her.

502
00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.276
-They should've accepted you.

503
00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.570
-No. it was for the best.

504
00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:10.947
If I'd have gone to Stanford we
wouldn't have roomed together.

505
00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:14.034
moved to the Bay together.
started Best Pal.

506
00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:16.578
I mean... who knows
where we'd be.

507
00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.997
-Well. chances are I'd still be
at home living with my mom.

508
00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.166
So thanks for the rejection.
Stanford!

509
00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:22.459
[chuckles]

510
00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:28.173
-Oh. you're up!

511
00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:29.716
Grab some coffee and then
come help me over here.

512
00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:30.592
-Yum.

513
00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.096
-So... how was girls'
night out?

514
00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:37.265
-Oh. it wasn't a thing.
It was just a quick drink.

515
00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:39.267
-But we actually ran into some
people from high school.

516
00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:41.186
-We actually ran into someone
twice yesterday.

517
00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:42.771
Do you remember Chris Silver?

518
00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:44.981
-Remember?
How could I forget?

519
00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:46.483
You two had the biggest crush
on him.

520
00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:47.609
-[scoffs]

521
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.485
-What was that phrase
you used to say?

522
00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:49.569
[both gasp]

523
00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:50.820
-Oh. I forgot.

524
00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:53.073
[in unison]
Never been Chris'd!

525
00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:55.325
-Um. what did that mean again?

526
00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.327
-It's what we used to call
Chris's girlfriends. Chris'd.

527
00:17:57.369 --> 00:17:58.995
-Because he'd date a girl

528
00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:00.747
and then suddenly she'd be
the most popular girl in school.

529
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:02.749
-Everyone would know who she
is and wanna be her best friend.

530
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:04.250
so we'd say she'd been Chris'd.

531
00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:05.710
-And that we had never
been Chris'd.

532
00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.253
-Yeah.

533
00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.213
-Well. one of you should've
been Chris'd.

534
00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:10.090
-[scoffs] No. No.

535
00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.133
He was way out of our league.

536
00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:13.802
-No. he wasn't.

537
00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:16.262
And even if he was then.
he sure isn't anymore.

538
00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:18.056
-Hm.

539
00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:19.683
-Anyways...

540
00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:22.602
I have some exciting news
I've been waiting to share.

541
00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:25.480
The reason why I wanted to have
Christmas here this year

542
00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:28.525
is because this'll be our
last Christmas in this house.

543
00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.359
-[gasps]

544
00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.987
'Cause I'm selling it
and moving...

545
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:34.280
-Wow Mom.
that's so exciting!

546
00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.324
-But. I haven't even told you...

547
00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:38.118
-That's so exciting and I really
wanna hear more about it.

548
00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:39.327
But we actually have to go
do that thing.

549
00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:41.121
Remember that thing we have.
that meeting?

550
00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:43.289
-Oh no! Oh yeah.
we are so late.

551
00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:44.290
-It's a really
important meeting.

552
00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:46.626
-Hey!
-So nice talking to you.

553
00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:48.044
What was that?

554
00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:49.796
You don't wanna hear
where she's going?

555
00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:52.215
-No. Whatever that woman has
to say I don't wanna hear it.

556
00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:53.299
-So you're just gonna run
outta the room

557
00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:54.300
every time she tries
to tell you.

558
00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:55.468
That's your game plan?

559
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.345
-Yes. Just kick
the can indefinitely.

560
00:18:57.387 --> 00:18:58.805
-Aren't you curious
what's in the can?

561
00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:00.640
-No. I'm not.

562
00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:04.060
You know those jack in the box
toys that you wind and you wind

563
00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:05.311
and you try to prepare yourself
for it

564
00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:07.897
and it always terrifies you?!

565
00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:10.108
This will be like that.

566
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.276
-Got it.

567
00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:16.156
Speaking of terrifying...

568
00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:17.949
are we really going to
Chris's party tonight?

569
00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:19.743
-Yeah. We'll make
an appearance.

570
00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:21.327
-Just popping by.

571
00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:22.662
-We might as well be polite.

572
00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:24.497
-Play it cool.

573
00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:25.832
-Play it so cool. I feel like
it'd be so rude not to come.

574
00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:27.250
-Yeah. so chill.

575
00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:28.418
-Just. like. chill in there.
Just. like. cruise.

576
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.294
-Okay.

577
00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:31.004
-You know?
-[sighs]

578
00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:33.006
-But it's. like. not a big deal.
-No. not a big deal at all.

579
00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:33.715
-Like. it's not a big deal.

580
00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:36.384
[in unison]
So what are you gonna wear?

581
00:19:44.309 --> 00:19:47.103
* Christmas time is here again*

582
00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:49.147
-Excuse me?
No. come on.

583
00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:50.190
* Full of winter cheer*

584
00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:51.691
You're fine. Smile.

585
00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.318
-I don't wanna smile.

586
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.444
* All the people
are gathered round*

587
00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:55.862
* as Christmas Day grows near.*

588
00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:00.033
-[whispering] Are we
overdressed?

589
00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:00.700
-No. they're underdressed.

590
00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:01.242
[gasps]

591
00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:02.994
-What?

592
00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:04.245
- I just realized this is our
first high school party ever.

593
00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:05.497
-First high school party
over 35.

594
00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:06.664
Doesn't that mean
we're kind of lame?

595
00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:08.124
-No. it means we're cooler
than ever.

596
00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.210
Okay. you hang the coats.
I'll pour the wine.

597
00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:11.127
-Don't leave me here.

598
00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:19.219
* ... I want to dance with
Father Christmas*

599
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:26.768
* I want to dance with
Father Christmas*

600
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.646
* Shoo-we-do-wap.
shoo-we-do-wap...*

601
00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:32.982
* Shoo-we-do-wap.
shoo-we-do-wap...*

602
00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:38.071
* I want to dance with
Father Christmas...*

603
00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:39.698
* Shoo-we-do-wap.
shoo-we-do-wap...*

604
00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:43.201
-I wrote my master's
thesis on that.

605
00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:44.744
-On The Great Gatsby?

606
00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:45.578
-Yeah.

607
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.791
I always wanted to say that
out loud to somebody.

608
00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:52.085
So thank you. Liz.
for that opportunity.

609
00:20:52.127 --> 00:20:53.169
Did I sound cool?

610
00:20:53.211 --> 00:20:54.295
-Yes.

611
00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:55.547
-Good. Good. good.

612
00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.048
It really is one of
my favorites.

613
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:57.882
-Really?

614
00:20:57.924 --> 00:20:59.384
-Yeah.

615
00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:00.218
-Why?

616
00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:05.890
-Just his theme that. uh...
you can't repeat the past.

617
00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:10.061
No matter how badly
you want a redo.

618
00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:15.191
-It's one of my favorites too.

619
00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:16.443
-Is that right?

620
00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:18.194
-Even though it is absolutely
heartbreaking.

621
00:21:18.236 --> 00:21:24.034
The idea of undeniable magnetism
despite one's circumstances.

622
00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:25.035
-Soulmates.

623
00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:28.580
-[chuckles]
Yeah.

624
00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.042
-[clears throat]

625
00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:35.045
Columbia. class of 2006.

626
00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:38.631
In honor of our unofficial
class reunion.

627
00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:40.508
how about a little immature
high school fun?

628
00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.177
-Yes please!

629
00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:46.264
-Let's play "Never Have I Ever"
Christmas cookie edition.

630
00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:47.849
So. simple rules.

631
00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:51.353
If you've done the thing.
eat the cookie. Okay?

632
00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:52.729
-This is a great idea.

633
00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:55.148
-This sounds awful.

634
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:56.149
-Terrible.

635
00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:57.108
-You have to come.

636
00:21:57.984 --> 00:21:58.735
Join me.

637
00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:01.279
-Okay. [chuckles]

638
00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:04.574
-So. living room. five minutes.
Be there or be square.

639
00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:06.618
-How I got the nickname
Party Marty

640
00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:07.744
was I woke up in
this cornfield...

641
00:22:07.786 --> 00:22:08.620
-Here we go.
here we go.

642
00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:09.788
-I'll tell you later.

643
00:22:11.331 --> 00:22:12.165
-Oh. you're gonna...
-Ah!

644
00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:12.957
-You're gonna. you're gonna...

645
00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:14.125
-[laughs]

646
00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:16.878
Hey! Isn't this Christmas cozy.
huh?

647
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.298
Alright! Let me get
this party started.

648
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.591
-Alright.

649
00:22:21.633 --> 00:22:24.469
-Okay. Uh... never have
I ever...

650
00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:25.929
gone to the principal's office.

651
00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:27.097
-Okay. that's a little...

652
00:22:27.138 --> 00:22:28.348
-Marty. that's for you!

653
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.267
-Alright. Okay.
Fine. fine. fine.

654
00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:32.185
You too. Chris.

655
00:22:32.227 --> 00:22:33.937
-Yeah. yeah.

656
00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:37.232
Never have I ever... toilet
papered someone's house.

657
00:22:37.273 --> 00:22:38.024
-That was my house!

658
00:22:38.066 --> 00:22:39.526
-I know.

659
00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:40.485
-My parents are still
teed-off about that.

660
00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:42.112
-More like TP'd off!

661
00:22:42.153 --> 00:22:43.446
-[in unison] Oh!

662
00:22:43.488 --> 00:22:44.322
[in unison]
Huh! Huh!

663
00:22:44.364 --> 00:22:45.115
[in unison]
Woo-woo-woo!

664
00:22:45.156 --> 00:22:46.866
[both laughing]

665
00:22:46.908 --> 00:22:47.826
-[laughing awkwardly]

666
00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:48.785
-It was Ryan's idea.

667
00:22:48.827 --> 00:22:50.704
-I hate you.
So annoying.

668
00:22:50.745 --> 00:22:51.621
-[mouthful] That was fun.

669
00:22:51.663 --> 00:22:54.916
-My turn.
Never have I ever...

670
00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:56.626
cheated to win
Jingle Bell Queen.

671
00:22:56.668 --> 00:22:57.627
-[gasps]

672
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:58.545
[Karly] You're outing me?

673
00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:00.422
-Yeah. Karly.

674
00:23:00.463 --> 00:23:02.090
-I knew it!
-You called it.

675
00:23:02.132 --> 00:23:03.758
-Okay. I admit it.

676
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.636
I might've voted for myself
more than once.

677
00:23:06.678 --> 00:23:08.013
-[coughs]
Eleven times.

678
00:23:08.054 --> 00:23:09.180
[all laughing]

679
00:23:09.222 --> 00:23:10.640
-Pathetic!

680
00:23:10.682 --> 00:23:13.685
-Okay fine. it's my turn.
Never have I ever...

681
00:23:13.727 --> 00:23:15.812
had a high school crush
on a friend.

682
00:23:15.854 --> 00:23:18.690
Wait. no. let me be
more specific.

683
00:23:18.732 --> 00:23:21.317
Never have I ever had
a high school crush...

684
00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:23.319
on Chris Silver.

685
00:23:23.361 --> 00:23:25.030
[men chuckling]

686
00:23:26.239 --> 00:23:27.323
There's a cookie waiting.

687
00:23:27.365 --> 00:23:28.283
[men chuckling]

688
00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:29.826
-I hate all of you.

689
00:23:29.868 --> 00:23:31.786
-Take the cookie. Liz.
Take the cookie.

690
00:23:31.828 --> 00:23:32.787
It's a game.

691
00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:33.913
-I'm not taking a cookie.

692
00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:38.335
-[Marty] I'll eat to that.
alright?

693
00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:39.544
-[Mindy] Mm-hmm.

694
00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:41.046
-[Karly] That is a very
empty tray.

695
00:23:41.087 --> 00:23:41.838
-[Marty] Uh-huh.

696
00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:49.220
-So. you had a crush on me.

697
00:23:50.055 --> 00:23:50.889
Cookie?

698
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.724
-Don't pretend to be surprised.

699
00:23:52.766 --> 00:23:55.518
Clearly everyone had
a crush on you.

700
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.853
You didn't even know
who I was.

701
00:23:56.895 --> 00:23:58.938
-No. that's not true.

702
00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.522
I knew.

703
00:23:59.564 --> 00:24:01.316
-Oh. Hmm.

704
00:24:01.358 --> 00:24:02.233
-I remember a lot about you.

705
00:24:02.275 --> 00:24:03.068
-Oh really?

706
00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:04.235
-Yeah.

707
00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:05.862
-Like what?

708
00:24:05.904 --> 00:24:08.239
-Like how you were
always blushing.

709
00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:09.949
It seems like every time
I saw you...

710
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:12.869
you were flushed.

711
00:24:14.245 --> 00:24:15.121
Crimson.

712
00:24:15.163 --> 00:24:16.206
-No.

713
00:24:16.247 --> 00:24:18.458
No. I wasn't.

714
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.711
It was just when I saw you.

715
00:24:21.753 --> 00:24:25.340
But you know. silly high school
crushes. you know?

716
00:24:25.382 --> 00:24:26.132
-Yeah.

717
00:24:27.592 --> 00:24:28.802
-What are you guys
talking about?

718
00:24:29.594 --> 00:24:30.970
-High school reminiscing.

719
00:24:32.597 --> 00:24:34.891
I should get back to hosting.

720
00:24:34.933 --> 00:24:35.850
How long are you guys
in town for?

721
00:24:35.892 --> 00:24:36.893
-Through the holidays.

722
00:24:36.935 --> 00:24:38.144
-Great. Can we do this again?

723
00:24:38.186 --> 00:24:39.229
-Mm-hmm.

724
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.855
-Like. hang out.

725
00:24:40.897 --> 00:24:41.564
Somewhere where we could
actually hear each other speak.

726
00:24:41.606 --> 00:24:43.149
-Totally.
-Yeah.

727
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:45.819
-There's a bakery on Main
that's doing a. um...

728
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.571
cocktail gingerbread decorating
thing tomorrow night.

729
00:24:48.613 --> 00:24:49.698
You guys free?

730
00:24:49.739 --> 00:24:50.115
-Yes.
-That could work.

731
00:24:50.156 --> 00:24:50.990
-Okay.

732
00:24:51.408 --> 00:24:52.242
Good.

733
00:24:53.326 --> 00:24:54.285
I'll text you.

734
00:24:58.331 --> 00:24:59.332
-So...

735
00:24:59.374 --> 00:25:01.084
-So... he's cute.

736
00:25:01.126 --> 00:25:04.087
-He's definitely cute.
And so sweet and vulnerable.

737
00:25:04.129 --> 00:25:04.921
-You should go for him.

738
00:25:04.963 --> 00:25:06.965
-No. you should go for him.

739
00:25:07.007 --> 00:25:08.633
-Well. if he's gonna like either
one of us. it's gonna be you.

740
00:25:08.675 --> 00:25:09.676
Everybody likes you.

741
00:25:09.718 --> 00:25:11.219
-That is not true.

742
00:25:11.261 --> 00:25:13.888
Everyone just sees me as
your employee and your sidekick.

743
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.515
-Wait. Do you really think that?

744
00:25:15.557 --> 00:25:16.307
-No!

745
00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:19.352
I don't know. Sometimes.

746
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.980
But this Chris thing.
it's romantic. Right?

747
00:25:22.022 --> 00:25:24.941
I mean. falling for your
high school crush again.

748
00:25:24.983 --> 00:25:27.777
It's like star-crossed lovers
together at last.

749
00:25:27.819 --> 00:25:29.320
-Yeah. it's a little
too romantic for me.

750
00:25:29.362 --> 00:25:33.324
But I like the logic of it.
Shared past. shared community.

751
00:25:33.366 --> 00:25:34.784
-Anyway. let's curb
the Chris talk.

752
00:25:34.826 --> 00:25:35.952
We are failing
the Bechtel test.

753
00:25:35.994 --> 00:25:38.204
-Yeah. We don't need
to be Chris'd.

754
00:25:38.246 --> 00:25:39.497
[scoffs]

755
00:25:39.539 --> 00:25:40.623
-Yeah. and neither of us
live here

756
00:25:40.665 --> 00:25:41.624
so it's not like we can
date him anyway.

757
00:25:41.666 --> 00:25:43.043
-Yeah. right.

758
00:25:43.084 --> 00:25:44.002
-Cool.

759
00:25:48.673 --> 00:25:49.799
-[Linda] I'm home!

760
00:25:49.841 --> 00:25:51.134
-Wanna quickly run out
of the room?

761
00:25:51.176 --> 00:25:52.218
-Do you think I have time?
-Mm.

762
00:25:55.889 --> 00:25:57.557
-[sighs] I did the Christmas
dinner shop.

763
00:25:57.599 --> 00:25:59.142
-Ooh.

764
00:25:59.184 --> 00:26:02.270
-I feel like I've barely
seen you since yesterday.

765
00:26:02.312 --> 00:26:04.481
It's like every time I enter
a room. you disappear.

766
00:26:04.522 --> 00:26:07.817
-I know. I'm sorry. Mom.
It's just been kinda crazy.

767
00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:09.986
-Well. now that
we're all together...

768
00:26:10.028 --> 00:26:12.072
I can finish telling you
my big news.

769
00:26:12.113 --> 00:26:12.864
-Ah...

770
00:26:14.074 --> 00:26:16.493
-I'm selling the house...
and moving to...

771
00:26:16.534 --> 00:26:18.495
drum roll please!

772
00:26:18.536 --> 00:26:20.246
-[makes drumming sound]

773
00:26:22.415 --> 00:26:24.167
-O-kay...

774
00:26:24.209 --> 00:26:27.504
Yeah. I'm moving to Palo Alto
to be close to you.

775
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.842
What is it. you're not happy?
You don't want me to live close?

776
00:26:32.884 --> 00:26:34.928
-No. I'm happy! Yay!

777
00:26:34.969 --> 00:26:37.055
-[clapping]
Yay!

778
00:26:37.097 --> 00:26:40.016
-It's just. Mom... Palo Alto.
is... it's very expensive

779
00:26:40.058 --> 00:26:44.521
and there's lots of
dangerous things there.

780
00:26:44.562 --> 00:26:44.938
I mean. like...

781
00:26:44.979 --> 00:26:45.689
-Snakes.

782
00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:46.272
-Like. like. snakes...

783
00:26:46.314 --> 00:26:47.399
-Snakes.

784
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:47.857
-Poisonous snakes
and it's really hot.

785
00:26:47.899 --> 00:26:48.775
-So hot!

786
00:26:48.817 --> 00:26:49.734
-Hot. Drought.

787
00:26:49.776 --> 00:26:51.027
-Drought! The drought.

788
00:26:51.069 --> 00:26:53.196
You love the snow.
And mosquitoes!

789
00:26:53.238 --> 00:26:54.739
-No.

790
00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:56.282
-Big mosquitoes.
And I just feel like...

791
00:26:56.324 --> 00:26:58.743
we should probably discuss
this further.

792
00:26:58.785 --> 00:26:59.619
-Of course.

793
00:26:59.661 --> 00:27:00.954
-Good.

794
00:27:00.995 --> 00:27:02.580
-There's so much to discuss!

795
00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:05.875
-Those boundaries are going
really well.

796
00:27:05.917 --> 00:27:06.793
-Shh!

797
00:27:06.835 --> 00:27:07.836
-What'd you say?

798
00:27:07.877 --> 00:27:09.004
[in unison]
Nothing.

799
00:27:15.677 --> 00:27:17.095
-What am I supposed to do?

800
00:27:17.137 --> 00:27:18.888
-Okay. hear me out.
Crazy idea.

801
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:19.889
-Okay.

802
00:27:19.931 --> 00:27:20.473
-Just tell her no.

803
00:27:22.434 --> 00:27:23.935
-And say what. I don't wanna
take care of her in her old age?

804
00:27:23.977 --> 00:27:25.353
I do wanna take care of her.

805
00:27:25.395 --> 00:27:26.438
-And that's very sweet of you

806
00:27:26.479 --> 00:27:27.439
but she doesn't need
taking care of.

807
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.190
She went rock climbing
last week.

808
00:27:29.232 --> 00:27:30.775
-Yeah. but she wants to be
close to me.

809
00:27:30.817 --> 00:27:32.485
I mean. I can't just say no.

810
00:27:32.527 --> 00:27:34.320
-Then I guess living close will
give you a great opportunity

811
00:27:34.362 --> 00:27:35.447
to set boundaries.

812
00:27:35.488 --> 00:27:36.865
-You don't get it
That's the thing.

813
00:27:36.906 --> 00:27:37.949
There will be no boundaries.

814
00:27:37.991 --> 00:27:39.659
This will not end here. Okay?

815
00:27:39.701 --> 00:27:43.204
This is like if you give a mouse
a cookie situation

816
00:27:43.246 --> 00:27:46.041
but the... the mouse is my mom
and the cookie is. like.

-No. I don't think that was him.

-That sounds like the door.
-Could be somebody else.

822
00:27:57.344 --> 00:27:59.387
-Yeah. there was a man
walking behind him.

823
00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:00.305
-Definitely somebody else.

824
00:28:00.347 --> 00:28:01.306

to play.

-What are you doing here?

833
00:28:15.862 --> 00:28:18.198
-Well. I'm just helping out
with some electrical stuff.

834
00:28:18.239 --> 00:28:19.824

on the side.

-That sounds doable.

841
00:28:29.042 --> 00:28:30.418
That's probably better
than my gifts.

842
00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.836
I do a bit of woodworking
so I handmade everybody

843
00:28:31.878 --> 00:28:34.589

-Okay. maybe it's a good gift
after all.

847
00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:42.639
-Yeah. Definitely.
-The best.

848
00:28:42.681 --> 00:28:44.307
-Well. I'd better get to work.
See you guys tonight?

and I'm so proud of her.

00:29:47.829 --> 00:29:50.123
-My mom always says you can
never have too many scarves.

881
00:29:50.165 --> 00:29:51.583
-I wanna see your mom.

882
00:29:51.624 --> 00:29:53.376
You two should come for
the sixth night of Hanukkah.

883
00:29:53.418 --> 00:29:55.128
we're gonna have
the whole mishpachah.

884
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.588
-Yeah. I'm sure she'd love to.

885
00:29:56.629 --> 00:29:58.506
-So. are you. um...
are you seeing anyone?

886
00:29:58.548 --> 00:29:59.591
-No. not right now.

887
00:29:59.632 --> 00:30:01.676
-What? Why not?
You're such a catch.

888
00:30:01.718 --> 00:30:04.429
-You can be single
and still be a catch.

889
00:30:04.471 --> 00:30:06.765
-Oh. hey Jojo!
Congrats on your news.

890
00:30:06.806 --> 00:30:08.600
-Oh. thank you.

891
00:30:08.641 --> 00:30:10.393
Now I can hang out with you
and Liz all the time.

892
00:30:10.435 --> 00:30:12.103
-Ah... well it'll be you.
me. Liz and my mom.

893
00:30:12.145 --> 00:30:14.356
She's moving to Palo Alto.

894
00:30:14.397 --> 00:30:16.775
-Linda's moving to be closer
to Naomi.

895
00:30:16.816 --> 00:30:17.817
Isn't that nice?

896
00:30:18.818 --> 00:30:19.944

Here we are.

00:30:28.161 --> 00:30:29.329
There he is.

901
00:30:31.498 --> 00:30:33.124
-What are we doing?
This isn't a date.

902
00:30:33.166 --> 00:30:35.210
-No. Totally just a group hang.

903
00:30:35.251 --> 00:30:35.794
-Yeah.

904
00:30:35.835 --> 00:30:36.711
-Yeah.

-Oops. sorry.

907
00:30:44.886 --> 00:30:47.555
Fun fact. everything here
is vegan.

908
00:30:49.349 --> 00:30:50.433
Well. maybe that's not
a fun fact.

909
00:30:50.475 --> 00:30:51.935
-No. it's very fun.

910
00:30:51.976 --> 00:30:54.145
I... wouldn't have been able
to tell the difference.

911
00:30:54.187 --> 00:30:56.606
-You're lying but
I appreciate that.

912
00:30:56.648 --> 00:30:58.900
You guys ever do this
in high school?

913
00:30:58.942 --> 00:31:00.068
We had a mocktail night.

914
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:01.695
Oh. sadly we didn't.

915
00:31:01.736 --> 00:31:03.530
-We didn't get out much.
We played a lot of Everquest.

916
00:31:03.571 --> 00:31:06.241
-No. Liz played a lot
of Everquest. not me.

917
00:31:06.282 --> 00:31:07.117

-You okay?

921
00:31:12.664 --> 00:31:14.165
Um... yup.
I'm just gonna clean that up.

922
00:31:14.207 --> 00:31:15.750
-No. no. no.
I got it.

923
00:31:15.792 --> 00:31:16.918
-And grab us some more...
No. no. no. Sit down. sit down.

924
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.003
-It's fine. it's fine.
-Please. I got it.

925
00:31:18.044 --> 00:31:19.004
-You sure?

926
00:31:19.045 --> 00:31:20.588
-Yup. Very sure. Yup.

927
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:21.548
-Okay.

928
00:31:24.592 --> 00:31:25.385
-Sorry.

929
00:31:26.511 --> 00:31:28.555
-You know. I keep meaning
to tell you.

930
00:31:28.596 --> 00:31:31.850
I actually downloaded.
uh... Best Pals once.

931
00:31:31.891 --> 00:31:33.393
-Best Pal. Singular.

932
00:31:34.019 --> 00:31:35.103
-Best Pal.

933
00:31:35.145 --> 00:31:37.188
-You did? How was it?

934
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:38.523
-It was intriguing.

935
00:31:38.565 --> 00:31:42.068
You know. it's... kinda
like online dating.

936
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:44.195
Meet a lot of people.
most of them are terrifying.

937
00:31:44.237 --> 00:31:45.697
-[laughs]

938
00:31:45.739 --> 00:31:47.365
-But you do hit it off
with a few. it's nice.

939
00:31:47.407 --> 00:31:49.659
-Yeah. if you're lucky.
-Yeah.

940
00:31:49.701 --> 00:31:53.371
-I don't know. online dating
has never worked out for me.

941
00:31:53.413 --> 00:31:56.708
I don't know.
I just want that in-person zing.

942
00:31:56.750 --> 00:32:00.795
that love at first sight
across the room.

943
00:32:00.837 --> 00:32:05.133
-Yeah. it does sound nice.
You ever had it?

944
00:32:05.175 --> 00:32:08.553
-Versions of it.
My parents had it.

945
00:32:08.595 --> 00:32:10.221
They were high
school sweethearts.

946
00:32:10.263 --> 00:32:11.056
-Wow. that's really rare.

947
00:32:11.097 --> 00:32:12.182
-Yeah.

948
00:32:12.223 --> 00:32:13.558
-They still together?

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.060

-I'm so sorry. I don't know
how I missed that.

952
00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:19.898
-It's okay. Thanks.

953
00:32:19.939 --> 00:32:21.316
-No. I just...

954
00:32:21.358 --> 00:32:22.400
I wish I could've been there
for you in high school.

955
00:32:22.442 --> 00:32:23.651
-What are you talking about?

956
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.072
-Talking about being
a romantic.

957
00:32:27.113 --> 00:32:28.573
-Oh. Liz is not a romantic.

958
00:32:28.615 --> 00:32:30.575
-And Naomi might be
too much of one.

959
00:32:30.617 --> 00:32:32.494
-I wouldn't say that.

960
00:32:32.535 --> 00:32:35.038
I mean. do I have a tendency
to fall for the fantasy

961
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.498
instead of who the person
actually is?

962
00:32:36.539 --> 00:32:37.582
-Sure.
-Yup.

963
00:32:38.458 --> 00:32:39.334
-But that's normal. right?

964
00:32:39.376 --> 00:32:41.002
-Mmm.

965
00:32:41.044 --> 00:32:42.337
-They got a name for it.
it's called the honeymoon phase.

966
00:32:42.379 --> 00:32:44.756
I'm very guilty of it. Naomi.

-[laughs]
Sorry.

974
00:33:00.271 --> 00:33:02.482
-So. not a romantic. huh Liz?

975
00:33:02.524 --> 00:33:05.026
-Not in the traditional sense.

976
00:33:05.068 --> 00:33:06.653
I don't get why believing
there's only one person

977
00:33:06.695 --> 00:33:09.197
out there for you is
considered romantic.

978
00:33:09.239 --> 00:33:12.283
But I am no expert.

979
00:33:12.325 --> 00:33:13.993
-What do you mean?

980
00:33:14.035 --> 00:33:19.290
-Well. just that romantic love
is not my most successful arena.

981
00:33:19.332 --> 00:33:22.127
-Why do you think that is?

982
00:33:22.168 --> 00:33:24.963
-Um... I don't know.

983
00:33:25.005 --> 00:33:26.589
Because of me?

984
00:33:26.631 --> 00:33:28.299
Because I have a hard time
fitting in.

985
00:33:28.341 --> 00:33:30.760
I'm a bit of a niche market.

986
00:33:30.802 --> 00:33:33.013
Maybe I'm just hard to love.

987
00:33:34.806 --> 00:33:37.767
-Liz. I know we don't know
each other that well...

988
00:33:37.809 --> 00:33:39.978
but I can assure you there's
no way that's true.

It's almond milk.

-So. what is going on here?

994
00:33:56.327 --> 00:33:57.787
There are obviously vibes
between you two.

-There's obviously vibes
between you two.

996
00:33:59.414 --> 00:34:00.582
But that's weird. right?

997
00:34:00.623 --> 00:34:02.250
Weird that he's vibing
with both of us.

998
00:34:02.292 --> 00:34:03.585
-Well maybe he's not vibing
with either of us.

999
00:34:03.626 --> 00:34:05.045
Maybe he's just friendly.

1000
00:34:05.086 --> 00:34:06.671
-What. he's just a genuinely
nice guy.

1001
00:34:06.713 --> 00:34:09.007
-Exactly. So...
this isn't weird.

-No. it's not weird.

1054
00:36:28.897 --> 00:36:30.523
All the letters
my dad sent me.

1055
00:36:30.565 --> 00:36:31.399
-[chuckles]

1056
00:36:33.234 --> 00:36:36.279
-Hey. why did you save
your Stanford rejection letter?

1057
00:36:36.321 --> 00:36:38.073
-Hmm. I don't know.
Motivation?

1058
00:36:41.034 --> 00:36:41.951
-Our yearbook.

1059
00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:44.913
Aww.

1060
00:36:46.539 --> 00:36:47.415
[both chuckle]

1061
00:36:50.627 --> 00:36:52.921
Jingle Ball royalty.

1062
00:36:52.962 --> 00:36:54.923
-Except it turns out
Karly cheated.

1063
00:36:54.964 --> 00:36:56.424
-She probably
would've won anyway.

1064
00:36:56.466 --> 00:36:58.093
-I know.

1065
00:36:58.134 --> 00:37:00.303
She was Jingle Ball queen.
Prom queen. Homecoming queen.

1066
00:37:00.345 --> 00:37:01.763
-Mm-hmm.

1067
00:37:01.805 --> 00:37:02.931
Oh.

1068
00:37:02.972 --> 00:37:04.557
-And Chris was
hockey team captain

1069
00:37:04.599 --> 00:37:06.142
and student body president.

1070
00:37:06.184 --> 00:37:07.310
I mean. I think there's. like...

1071
00:37:07.352 --> 00:37:10.563
a single photo of us
in this entire book.

1072
00:37:10.605 --> 00:37:12.232
-[sighs]
Yeah.

1073
00:37:12.273 --> 00:37:14.609
-Should we have done
high school differently?

1074
00:37:14.651 --> 00:37:15.694
-Differently how?

1075
00:37:15.735 --> 00:37:17.237
-I don't know.

1076
00:37:17.278 --> 00:37:20.532
Joined a club. played a sport.
gone to a dance.

1077
00:37:20.573 --> 00:37:22.951
-I wanted to go to all the
dances but you didn't wanna go.

1078
00:37:22.992 --> 00:37:24.077
-Well why didn't you go
without me?

1079
00:37:24.119 --> 00:37:25.662
-I didn't want you
to feel left out.

1080
00:37:28.456 --> 00:37:31.334
And it wouldn't have been fun
without you anyway. So...

1081
00:37:33.545 --> 00:37:34.170
[phone chimes]

1082
00:37:34.212 --> 00:37:35.213
[phone alert pings]

1083
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:42.012
[both chuckle]

1084
00:37:44.264 --> 00:37:45.640
-Just loves a group hang.

1085
00:37:47.017 --> 00:37:48.476
-Sure does.

1086

[upbeat music]

1087
00:37:55.191 --> 00:37:55.775
-Hey!

1088
00:37:55.817 --> 00:37:56.443
-You okay?

1089
00:37:56.484 --> 00:37:58.028
-Yup!

1090
00:37:58.069 --> 00:38:00.196
Why don't you guys.
uh. go without me.

1091
00:38:00.238 --> 00:38:01.531
-No. We'll stick together.

1092
00:38:01.573 --> 00:38:03.033
-No. really.

1093
00:38:03.074 --> 00:38:04.784
I mean. skate a few laps
'cause I think these skates...

1094
00:38:04.826 --> 00:38:07.454
yeah. they're broken. and
I'm just gonna tighten them.

1095
00:38:07.495 --> 00:38:08.455
So...

1096
00:38:08.496 --> 00:38:09.205
-Are you sure?

1097
00:38:09.247 --> 00:38:09.873
-Whoa!

1098
00:38:09.914 --> 00:38:10.707
-Okay. alright.

1099
00:38:10.749 --> 00:38:12.125
-All good! All good!

1100
00:38:12.167 --> 00:38:13.043
-You need a hand.
let me help you up.

1101
00:38:13.084 --> 00:38:14.419
-You heard her. she's fine.

1102
00:38:14.461 --> 00:38:15.670
-I'm good. Okay.

1103
00:38:15.712 --> 00:38:16.504
-You're positive.

1104
00:38:16.546 --> 00:38:17.630
-Have fun!

1105
00:38:17.672 --> 00:38:19.132
-Okay. we'll be close by
if you need us.

1106
00:38:24.721 --> 00:38:27.599
Liz. wait.
You can skate.

1107
00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.975
-You can too.
-I mean...

1108
00:38:29.017 --> 00:38:31.436
-Did that come
from playing hockey?

1109
00:38:31.478 --> 00:38:34.272
I was looking at our senior
yearbook today.

1110
00:38:34.314 --> 00:38:37.317
I was reminded that you were
hockey team captain.

1111
00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:38.693
-[chuckles]

1112
00:38:38.735 --> 00:38:40.779
-And student body president.
And Jingle Ball king.

1113
00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.030
-Yeah.

1114
00:38:43.198 --> 00:38:45.033
On the endless teenage quest
for validation.

1115
00:38:45.075 --> 00:38:47.702
-Yeah. well you were
Chris Silver.

1116
00:38:47.744 --> 00:38:49.079
-That was what I was.

1117
00:38:50.288 --> 00:38:56.294
But now I'm just Chris.
living in Weston.

1118
00:38:56.336 --> 00:38:58.171
Teaching at our old high school.

1119
00:38:58.213 --> 00:38:59.923
-And that's not enough for you?

1120
00:38:59.964 --> 00:39:01.716
-Uh... yeah. I mean.
it is.

1121
00:39:01.758 --> 00:39:04.719
I love teaching. I do. I just...
sometimes feel like...

1122
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.307
maybe I could've done more
with my life.

1123
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:10.517
-Why do you feel that?

1124
00:39:12.227 --> 00:39:13.728
-You wanna know?
-Mm-hmm.

1125
00:39:15.313 --> 00:39:18.066
-My dad was a decorated
Marine and a self-made man.

1126
00:39:18.108 --> 00:39:20.944
He always taught me
to be the best.

1127
00:39:20.985 --> 00:39:25.740
He said... unless
you're a lead dog.

1128
00:39:25.782 --> 00:39:27.534
the scenery never changes.

1129
00:39:27.575 --> 00:39:29.119
-I get that.

1130
00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.037
My parents divorced
when I was younger.

1131
00:39:31.079 --> 00:39:32.455
my dad remarried.
moved away.

1132
00:39:32.497 --> 00:39:33.873
-Oh. man.

1133
00:39:33.915 --> 00:39:35.625
-As a child I told myself
that if I was good enough

1134
00:39:35.667 --> 00:39:39.838
or successful enough or...
something enough...

1135
00:39:39.879 --> 00:39:41.131
he'd come back.

1136
00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:43.717
Luckily as an adult

1137
00:39:43.758 --> 00:39:46.678
I have absolutely no need
for validation.

1138
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.555
-Of course.

1139
00:39:48.596 --> 00:39:49.347
Me too.

1140
00:39:51.057 --> 00:39:54.227
[romantic music swells]

1141
00:40:04.863 --> 00:40:06.197
-You okay?

1142
00:40:07.407 --> 00:40:08.533
-Yeah. Do you wanna go get a...

1143
00:40:08.575 --> 00:40:09.576
[screams]

1144
00:40:09.617 --> 00:40:10.577
-Ow.

1145
00:40:11.911 --> 00:40:15.248
-Liz! No. no. no...

1146
00:40:15.707 --> 00:40:17.167
-You alright?

1147
00:40:17.208 --> 00:40:18.793
-Please. it's okay.
I'm fine. really.

1148
00:40:18.835 --> 00:40:19.794
-Give me a second.

1149
00:40:19.836 --> 00:40:20.920
-[winces]
Ooh.

1150
00:40:20.962 --> 00:40:23.089
-It hurts. doesn't it? Okay.

1151
00:40:23.131 --> 00:40:25.050
Look. there is a bit
of swelling.

1152
00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:27.052
It might be a light sprain.

1153
00:40:27.093 --> 00:40:28.136
-It's better than that time

1154
00:40:28.178 --> 00:40:29.721
you jumped into that cake.
Remember?

1155
00:40:29.763 --> 00:40:31.056
-Jumped into a cake?

1156
00:40:31.097 --> 00:40:32.182
-Yeah. you had to be there.

1157
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:36.061
-I feel like you guys have a
lot of "you had to be there's".

1158
00:40:36.102 --> 00:40:37.020
Don't you?

1159
00:40:37.062 --> 00:40:38.188
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1160
00:40:38.897 --> 00:40:39.773
-Look. I'm gonna leave
this here.

1161
00:40:39.814 --> 00:40:41.274
-Oh.

1162
00:40:41.316 --> 00:40:42.650
-This is gonna keep
your foot warm.

1163
00:40:42.692 --> 00:40:44.194
-Thanks.

1164
00:40:44.235 --> 00:40:46.654
-I know you're okay...
and I am gonna get you some ice.

1165
00:40:46.696 --> 00:40:48.239
Elevate your gloved foot.
if you don't mind.

1166
00:40:48.281 --> 00:40:49.115
-Thank you.

1167
00:40:49.157 --> 00:40:50.325
-I'll be right back.

1168
00:40:52.744 --> 00:40:54.120
-You sure you're okay?

1169
00:40:54.162 --> 00:40:56.164
-Nothing bruised but my ego.

1170
00:40:56.206 --> 00:40:58.291
-Well. were you having fun
with Chris before that?

1171
00:40:58.333 --> 00:41:00.251
-It was fine. Whatever.

1172
00:41:01.795 --> 00:41:04.422
Naomi. I'm not into him.

1173
00:41:04.464 --> 00:41:04.964
-Really?

1174
00:41:05.006 --> 00:41:06.716
-Yeah. really.

1175
00:41:06.758 --> 00:41:09.052
He's cute in a high school
throwback kinda way.

1176
00:41:09.094 --> 00:41:10.136
but that's it.

1177
00:41:10.178 --> 00:41:13.139
-Hm. Okay.

1178
00:41:13.181 --> 00:41:15.266
-Alright. alright.

1179
00:41:15.308 --> 00:41:16.434
Let's get your gloved foot
outta here.

1180
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.561
Come on.

1181
00:41:20.438 --> 00:41:23.024
-You know what?
You guys skate.

1182
00:41:23.066 --> 00:41:24.192
-No. no. no.
Come on. let's get you home.

1183
00:41:24.234 --> 00:41:25.944
-Oh...
-We're not gonna leave you.

1184
00:41:25.985 --> 00:41:27.320
-Go have fun.

1185
00:41:29.072 --> 00:41:30.949
-Okay. You sure?

1186
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:31.825
-Yeah.
-You heard her.

1187
00:41:31.866 --> 00:41:32.826
-Sure.

1188
00:41:37.414 --> 00:41:38.665
-We will only be a moment.
Alright. Easy.

1189
00:41:38.707 --> 00:41:39.666
-Okay.

1190
00:41:39.708 --> 00:41:40.458
[both laughing]

1191
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.835
-Bye. love you!
-Bye.

1192
00:41:41.876 --> 00:41:42.794
-[Chris] I gotcha.

1193
00:41:43.336 --> 00:41:44.504
-[Naomi] It's been a while.

1194
00:41:44.546 --> 00:41:46.006
-Yeah. just don't look down.
Look at me.

1195
00:41:46.047 --> 00:41:47.007
You gotta distract yourself.
-Uh huh.

1196
00:41:47.048 --> 00:41:48.091
-You understand?

1197
00:41:48.133 --> 00:41:49.342
Don't think about
your skates.

1198
00:41:49.384 --> 00:41:50.885
Think about that high school
crush you had.

1199
00:41:50.927 --> 00:41:54.014
-You're still talking about
that. it was nothing.

1200
00:41:54.055 --> 00:41:57.308
-Why are you blushing.
cheek Pinocchio?

1201
00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:59.519
-Okay. okay.
Alright. alright.

1202
00:41:59.561 --> 00:42:00.854
Just... let's get back
to the crush.

1203
00:42:00.895 --> 00:42:02.981
That seemed to work.
Keep yourself distracted.

1204
00:42:03.023 --> 00:42:04.149
-What's there to say?

1205
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:07.068
I mean it was just
teenage daydreams.

1206
00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:10.280
You'd pass me a note in the
hallway. stop by my locker.

1207
00:42:10.321 --> 00:42:11.573
-[chuckles]

1208
00:42:11.614 --> 00:42:14.617
-We'd go for ice cream
or to the movies.

1209
00:42:14.659 --> 00:42:16.703
It was more about you
finally seeing me.

1210
00:42:16.745 --> 00:42:18.288
You know?

1211
00:42:18.329 --> 00:42:20.248
You picking me and me
feeling special.

1212
00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:21.458
Because...

1213
00:42:23.376 --> 00:42:24.753
-'Cause I was Chris Silver.

1214
00:42:26.963 --> 00:42:28.715
-Yeah. We should get...

1215
00:42:30.258 --> 00:42:32.427
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

1216
00:42:42.979 --> 00:42:45.065
-You've been Chris'd.

1217
00:42:45.106 --> 00:42:46.649
-I'm sorry.

1218
00:42:46.691 --> 00:42:49.611
-Why are you apologizing?
I'm happy for you.

1219
00:42:49.652 --> 00:42:52.530
You're into him and I already
told you that I'm not.

1220
00:42:52.572 --> 00:42:54.240
Plus it was obvious you two
would have a thing.

1221
00:42:54.282 --> 00:42:55.825
-No. it wasn't a thing.

1222
00:42:55.867 --> 00:42:58.244
It was just a heat of the moment
mistletoe kiss.

1223
00:42:58.286 --> 00:42:59.162
-Ooh! Mistletoe Chris.

1224
00:42:59.204 --> 00:42:59.996
-[chuckle]

1225
00:43:01.373 --> 00:43:01.998
-But really. you have
my blessing.

1226
00:43:03.416 --> 00:43:04.918
So?

1227
00:43:04.959 --> 00:43:07.087
Was it everything we ever
dreamed of?

1228
00:43:07.128 --> 00:43:09.839
-No. It was nothing.

1229
00:43:09.881 --> 00:43:10.840
-Oh. Okay.

1230
00:43:13.885 --> 00:43:14.678
Come on.

* I can't wait to be...

1237
00:44:54.611 --> 00:44:56.071
-Hey Liz.

1238
00:44:56.112 --> 00:44:57.906
-Hey!

1239
00:44:57.947 --> 00:44:59.532
Doing some last-minute
shopping?

1240
00:44:59.574 --> 00:45:02.327
-Actually. this is my store.
This and the gift shop on Elm.

1241
00:45:02.369 --> 00:45:04.412
-Oh. I love that place.
Here too.

1242
00:45:04.454 --> 00:45:06.456
I mean. I want everything
in here.

1243
00:45:06.498 --> 00:45:07.707
-Of course. it makes sense.

1244
00:45:07.749 --> 00:45:09.125
-What do you mean?

1245
00:45:09.167 --> 00:45:11.795
-Just that you've always had
stellar style.

1246
00:45:11.836 --> 00:45:14.506
Even in 2004. you pulled off
Juicy Velour tracksuits

1247
00:45:14.547 --> 00:45:15.840
and trucker hats.

1248
00:45:15.882 --> 00:45:18.301
-Well. uh. thank you.

1249
00:45:18.343 --> 00:45:21.554
But I am very. very glad
those days are behind us.

1250
00:45:21.596 --> 00:45:22.722
-Me too.

1251
00:45:25.058 --> 00:45:26.768
-You know. I'm sorry.
I'm understaffed today.

1252
00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:28.269
I should get back
to the floor.

1253
00:45:28.311 --> 00:45:30.730
Oh! But the crew's doing
Christmas karaoke tonight.

1254
00:45:30.772 --> 00:45:32.482
Brews Brothers around 7:00?

1255
00:45:32.524 --> 00:45:34.025
-Yeah. I'll see if Naomi's free.

1256
00:45:34.067 --> 00:45:36.444
-But even if she's not.
come hang.

1257
00:45:36.486 --> 00:45:38.363
-Yeah. Totally.

1258
00:45:38.405 --> 00:45:40.240
-Good. It'll be fun.

1259
00:45:40.281 --> 00:45:40.782
I'll see you there.

1260
00:45:40.824 --> 00:45:41.700
-Sounds good.

[cheerful music]

1262
00:45:53.628 --> 00:45:55.380
-Wrapping my present?

1263
00:45:55.422 --> 00:45:56.798
-My mom's wrapping
all the presents

1264
00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.592
so she can pack
the wrapping paper.

1265
00:45:59.634 --> 00:46:01.553
-So Liz. how was shopping?

1266
00:46:01.594 --> 00:46:03.138
-Good. Main Street is poppin'.

1267
00:46:03.179 --> 00:46:04.681
Oh. and you know
that boutique we love?

1268
00:46:04.723 --> 00:46:05.890
Karly owns it.

1269
00:46:05.932 --> 00:46:07.434
-Yes. that makes sense.

1270
00:46:07.475 --> 00:46:08.518
-So. what's the plan for today?

1271
00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.228
-This...

1272
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:12.814
and then we're debating either
a Christmas movie or baking.

1273
00:46:12.856 --> 00:46:16.151
and then... I actually have
plans later.

1274
00:46:16.693 --> 00:46:17.819
-I actually have plans too.

1275
00:46:18.611 --> 00:46:19.988
-Oh! Cool.

1276
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:21.197
-Yeah. Cool.

1277
00:46:22.574 --> 00:46:23.783
-Cool.

1278
00:46:25.785 --> 00:46:27.912
[light cheery music]

1279
00:46:28.997 --> 00:46:30.206
[whispering]
-It's a lot of chocolate.
-So much chocolate.

1280
00:46:30.248 --> 00:46:30.749
-Thank you.

1281
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:32.334
-You're welcome.

1282
00:46:32.375 --> 00:46:34.753
-I know your first thought
when you have chocolate is...

1283
00:46:34.794 --> 00:46:36.129
I would love some cheese.

1284
00:46:36.171 --> 00:46:37.172
-[laughs]

1285
00:46:37.213 --> 00:46:40.467
I mean. I love anything
with cheese.

1286
00:46:40.508 --> 00:46:44.012
But it's not vegan so should...

1287
00:46:44.054 --> 00:46:44.929
-Come here.

1288
00:46:44.971 --> 00:46:45.764
-What?

1289
00:46:47.098 --> 00:46:49.309
-It's vegan.
Whole place is vegan.

1290
00:46:49.351 --> 00:46:51.686
Yeah. they just don't advertise
it so that people don't hate it.

1291
00:46:51.728 --> 00:46:53.521
-[chuckles]
Secret vegans?

1292
00:46:53.563 --> 00:46:55.273
-Mm-hmm.
That's right.

1293
00:46:55.315 --> 00:46:56.358
-That's amazing.

1294
00:46:56.399 --> 00:46:57.859
-I know.

1295
00:46:57.901 --> 00:46:59.819
-So. how long have
you been vegan?

1296
00:46:59.861 --> 00:47:01.237
-Since leaving the forces.

1297
00:47:02.655 --> 00:47:03.490
-Really?

1298
00:47:03.531 --> 00:47:04.657
-Yeah.

1299
00:47:04.699 --> 00:47:07.077
-Wow. What inspired that?

1300
00:47:07.118 --> 00:47:09.162
-It just. um...

1301
00:47:09.204 --> 00:47:11.790
it felt like the right thing
to do.

1302
00:47:11.831 --> 00:47:13.208
Felt like who I wanted to be.
you know?

1303
00:47:13.249 --> 00:47:15.835
I spent my whole life trying
to be other people

1304
00:47:15.877 --> 00:47:17.420
and worrying about what
other people thought of me.

1305
00:47:17.462 --> 00:47:20.632
And this just felt like
something. um... just for me.

1306
00:47:20.674 --> 00:47:24.719
-I get that.
I'm impressed.

1307
00:47:24.761 --> 00:47:27.138
I mean. it's hard to go
against the tide

1308
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.266
and it's even harder to know
who you wanna be.

1309
00:47:31.601 --> 00:47:34.229
-Yeah. You're right.

1310
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:35.772
Thank you. that means
a lot actually.

1311
00:47:35.814 --> 00:47:37.315
-[chuckles]
Yeah.

1312
00:47:37.357 --> 00:47:39.025
-What about you?

1313
00:47:39.067 --> 00:47:41.403
Did you always wanna be
a visionary entrepreneur?

1314
00:47:41.444 --> 00:47:42.278
-It's that what I am?

1315
00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.279
-Mm-hmm.
-No.

1316
00:47:43.321 --> 00:47:44.823
-Mm-hmm.

1317
00:47:44.864 --> 00:47:49.619
-Um... no. Actually. I never
knew what I wanted to be.

1318
00:47:49.661 --> 00:47:51.079
-Really?

1319
00:47:51.121 --> 00:47:53.123
-I don't know. all my dreams
were kid dreams.

1320
00:47:53.164 --> 00:47:54.290
-Hmm.

1321
00:47:54.332 --> 00:47:57.293
-Open up the flower shop.
own the bakery.

1322
00:47:57.335 --> 00:47:59.170
It's silly.

1323
00:47:59.212 --> 00:48:00.255
-No. these are great dreams.
What are you talking about?

1324
00:48:00.296 --> 00:48:01.423
-Yeah?

1325
00:48:01.464 --> 00:48:02.924
-Yes.

1326
00:48:02.966 --> 00:48:04.509
How'd you get to.
uh. Best Pal though?

1327
00:48:04.551 --> 00:48:06.052
-Liz.

1328
00:48:06.094 --> 00:48:09.764
She always has these great.
big ideas and...

1329
00:48:09.806 --> 00:48:13.268
so I hitched my wagon
to hers and...

1330
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:14.519
let her drag me along.

1331
00:48:17.105 --> 00:48:20.233
-Something tells me nobody
drags you along. Naomi.

1332
00:48:20.275 --> 00:48:22.235
I have no doubt
that she needed you

1333
00:48:22.277 --> 00:48:24.029
just as much as
you needed her.

1334
00:48:26.322 --> 00:48:27.282
-Thanks.

1335
00:48:29.367 --> 00:48:30.326
-Just my thought.

1336
00:48:35.415 --> 00:48:36.458
-So no senior trip?

1337
00:48:36.499 --> 00:48:37.584
-Nope.

1338
00:48:37.625 --> 00:48:38.168
-A football game?

1339
00:48:38.209 --> 00:48:39.169
-Nope.

1340
00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:40.837
-Prom?

1341
00:48:40.879 --> 00:48:42.964
-No. none of it.
I didn't go to a single thing.

1342
00:48:43.006 --> 00:48:45.592
-Alright. Who's ready
for some merry-a-oke?

1343
00:48:45.633 --> 00:48:46.926
[crowd cheers]

1344
00:48:46.968 --> 00:48:48.970
-Yes please! I'm in.

1345
00:48:49.012 --> 00:48:50.263
-We're gonna start
with Jingle Bells.

1346
00:48:50.305 --> 00:48:51.514
Ready? Here we go.

1347
00:48:51.556 --> 00:48:53.725
-So... why? Was it because
you were too cool?

1348
00:48:53.767 --> 00:48:55.518
-Me? Too cool?

1349
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.146
Those two words have never
been uttered in sequence.

1350
00:48:58.188 --> 00:49:01.483
-Really? You always seemed
too cool.

1351
00:49:01.524 --> 00:49:02.984
Honestly. I was jealous of you.

1352
00:49:03.026 --> 00:49:04.194
-You were jealous of me?

1353
00:49:04.235 --> 00:49:06.112
-Yeah.

1354
00:49:06.154 --> 00:49:08.406
You just always seemed
to have such a clear sense

1355
00:49:08.448 --> 00:49:09.783
of who you were.

1356
00:49:09.824 --> 00:49:11.993
You seemed so self-assured.

1357
00:49:12.035 --> 00:49:13.870
-I must've faked it really well

1358
00:49:13.912 --> 00:49:16.206
because I was a flailing
ball of insecurity.

1359
00:49:16.247 --> 00:49:18.208
I felt like I didn't
belong anywhere.

1360
00:49:18.249 --> 00:49:19.542
-What?

1361
00:49:19.584 --> 00:49:20.877
-Honestly. I was jealous
of you.

1362
00:49:20.919 --> 00:49:23.004
-Jealous of me?

1363
00:49:23.046 --> 00:49:25.840
I cheated to be
Jingle Ball queen.

1364
00:49:25.882 --> 00:49:27.842
-It wasn't about being
Jingle Ball queen.

1365
00:49:27.884 --> 00:49:30.929
I was jealous because you
hosted Jingle Ball.

1366
00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:33.932
It was the social event of
the year and you gave that

1367
00:49:33.973 --> 00:49:36.142
to everyone. helped by
your friends.

1368
00:49:36.184 --> 00:49:38.019
and I... I wanted that.

1369
00:49:38.061 --> 00:49:39.521
I... wanted to be able
to feel like

1370
00:49:39.562 --> 00:49:41.398
I had something
to give back.

1371
00:49:41.439 --> 00:49:44.234
-Well... you have it now.
so do it.

1372
00:49:44.275 --> 00:49:45.527
-Yeah. do it.

1373
00:49:45.568 --> 00:49:46.903
-Do what? [chuckles]

1374
00:49:46.945 --> 00:49:48.905
-Throw us a Jingle Ball!

1375
00:49:48.947 --> 00:49:50.281
We always have an unofficial
class reunion

1376
00:49:50.323 --> 00:49:52.075
the night before Christmas Eve.

1377
00:49:52.867 --> 00:49:54.661
You could host Jingle Ball!

1378
00:49:54.703 --> 00:49:56.246
-No. No. no. no. no. no.

1379
00:49:56.287 --> 00:49:57.330
-Yes.

1380
00:49:57.372 --> 00:49:58.540
-Why not?

1381
00:49:58.581 --> 00:50:00.291
-Yes.

1382
00:50:00.333 --> 00:50:01.334
-I'm sure Chris could get us
the high school gym.

1383
00:50:01.376 --> 00:50:03.920
-He definitely can.
-Oh. come on!

1384
00:50:03.962 --> 00:50:06.756
[chanting] Jingle Ball!
Jingle Ball!

1385
00:50:06.798 --> 00:50:09.801
[crowd chants] Jingle Ball!
Jingle Ball!

1386
00:50:09.843 --> 00:50:13.179
[chanting] Jingle Ball!
Jingle Ball!

1387
00:50:13.221 --> 00:50:16.016
-Hey. What's going on
over here?

1388
00:50:16.057 --> 00:50:17.475
-I'm hosting Jingle Ball!

1389
00:50:17.517 --> 00:50:19.269
-Yay!!!
-[glasses clink]

1390
00:50:28.361 --> 00:50:30.739
-[voice on video] Ensure
your log is clean and dry.

1391
00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.242
If needed. brush off any dirt
or debris with a towel.

1392
00:50:34.284 --> 00:50:36.578
-How are we failing
at this so hard?

1393
00:50:36.619 --> 00:50:38.496
This looks nothing
like a Menorah.

1394
00:50:38.538 --> 00:50:41.041
-It's because we haven't put
on the shelf mushrooms yet.

1395
00:50:41.082 --> 00:50:42.292
-Maybe we should just quit this

1396
00:50:42.334 --> 00:50:44.294
and watch a DIY on throwing
a dance.

1397
00:50:44.336 --> 00:50:45.670
-Yeah. you could definitely use
some pointers.

1398
00:50:47.047 --> 00:50:48.298
No. I just...

1399
00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.716
I mean 'cause you've never been
to a dance.

1400
00:50:49.758 --> 00:50:51.426
I mean. you've never even wanted
to go to a dance.

1401
00:50:54.179 --> 00:50:56.931
-Actually. I wanted to go
to all of them.

1402
00:50:56.973 --> 00:50:58.183
-What?

1403
00:50:59.017 --> 00:51:00.810
Well why didn't we?

1404
00:51:00.852 --> 00:51:01.895
-I don't know.

1405
00:51:01.936 --> 00:51:03.021
I knew that if we went.

1406
00:51:03.063 --> 00:51:04.397
you'd constantly be asked
to dance

1407
00:51:04.439 --> 00:51:05.857
while I'd be left standing
there alone.

1408
00:51:10.862 --> 00:51:12.280
[notification alert]

1409
00:51:12.322 --> 00:51:13.782
-Why don't you invite him
to Hanukkah?

1410
00:51:13.823 --> 00:51:16.659
-No. Really?

1411
00:51:16.701 --> 00:51:18.286
-The more the merrier.

1412
00:51:18.828 --> 00:51:19.704
-Okay.

1413
00:51:25.627 --> 00:51:28.755
-So? What's the deal
with you two?

1414
00:51:28.797 --> 00:51:30.090
-I don't know.

1415
00:51:30.131 --> 00:51:32.384
He's... amazing.

1416
00:51:32.425 --> 00:51:37.013
He's so empathetic
and kind and sweet and...

1417
00:51:37.055 --> 00:51:39.099
I kind of wonder
if he's the one.

1418
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.642
[small chuckle]

1419
00:51:40.684 --> 00:51:41.434
-The one?

1420
00:51:41.476 --> 00:51:42.394
-Yeah.

1421
00:51:42.435 --> 00:51:44.854
-[laughs]
You've been on one date.

1422
00:51:44.896 --> 00:51:46.314
-Well. yeah.

1423
00:51:46.356 --> 00:51:47.857
But I've known him
for. like. 20 years.

1424
00:51:47.899 --> 00:51:49.150
-From a distance.

1425
00:51:49.192 --> 00:51:51.277
In reality. you barely
know this man.

1426
00:51:52.737 --> 00:51:53.446
[notification alert]

1427
00:51:56.241 --> 00:51:58.368
-So. Jingle Ball.
What's the deal?

1428
00:51:58.410 --> 00:51:59.536
What can I help with?

1429
00:51:59.577 --> 00:52:01.413
-Oh. it's fine.
Karly's helping me.

1430
00:52:04.582 --> 00:52:05.583
-Great.

1431
00:52:10.255 --> 00:52:12.882
-Oh! I have so many
memories here.

1432
00:52:12.924 --> 00:52:15.677
My first dance.
My first kiss.

1433
00:52:15.719 --> 00:52:17.220
My first break up.

1434
00:52:17.262 --> 00:52:19.723
Oh. and I remember
the Jingle Ball.

1435
00:52:19.764 --> 00:52:21.516
And Mr. Fray announcing
I had won

1436
00:52:21.558 --> 00:52:24.853
and being so afraid people
would know I cheated.

1437
00:52:24.894 --> 00:52:27.355
-Why did you cheat?

1438
00:52:27.397 --> 00:52:29.941
-I guess I felt like I had
to be queen.

1439
00:52:29.983 --> 00:52:31.901
Like. who would I be without it?

1440
00:52:31.943 --> 00:52:33.695
-Yeah. I feel that.

1441
00:52:33.737 --> 00:52:35.739
I mean. I feel that way about
my company.

1442
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.115
My success.

1443
00:52:37.157 --> 00:52:39.492
Like... who am I without it?

1444
00:52:41.202 --> 00:52:45.040
Anyway. So... DJ
on the stage.

1445
00:52:45.081 --> 00:52:46.583
-Mm-hmm.

1446
00:52:46.624 --> 00:52:49.252
-Bar over here next
to a table of nibbles.

1447
00:52:49.294 --> 00:52:50.920
-Oh. and Ryan's
wife's a caterer.

1448
00:52:50.962 --> 00:52:52.422
-Oh! Perfect.
-Yeah.

1449
00:52:52.464 --> 00:52:53.840
Oh! We should do
a photo-booth.

1450
00:52:53.882 --> 00:52:56.092
Dina Frank is a photographer
so that's covered.

1451
00:52:56.134 --> 00:52:57.510
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1452
00:52:57.552 --> 00:53:00.722
-I can see it all.
What about a theme?

1453
00:53:00.764 --> 00:53:02.932
-Jingle Ball is always
holiday-themed.

1454
00:53:02.974 --> 00:53:04.934
-How about early 2000's.

1455
00:53:04.976 --> 00:53:06.895
-Yes!

1456
00:53:06.936 --> 00:53:08.355
-Frosted lip gloss. lace-up
jeans. bedazzled everything.

1457
00:53:08.396 --> 00:53:12.734
-Stop it. Oh. it's gonna be
so good.

1458
00:53:12.776 --> 00:53:15.278
So how do you feel about a
Jingle Ball queen and king?

1459
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.946
-Yeah. I don't know.

1460
00:53:16.988 --> 00:53:19.407
I think that we're honestly
really past that at this point.

1461
00:53:19.449 --> 00:53:21.117
But... you know what?

1462
00:53:21.159 --> 00:53:23.953
Actually now that I think about
it. it's a really good idea.

1463
00:53:23.995 --> 00:53:25.205
-Oh. yay!

1464
00:53:25.246 --> 00:53:26.456
[laughs]

1465
00:53:29.834 --> 00:53:31.920
-It's so lovely to see you.
thank you for coming.

1466
00:53:31.961 --> 00:53:33.046
-Hey.
-One second.

1467
00:53:33.088 --> 00:53:35.173
-Hi.
-Hi.

1468
00:53:35.215 --> 00:53:36.341
-Hi.

1469
00:53:37.926 --> 00:53:38.968
-Oh. I see your mom.

1470
00:53:39.594 --> 00:53:40.720
-I love your earrings.

1471
00:53:40.762 --> 00:53:42.389
-You like? Karly lent them
to me.

1472
00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:43.682
-Oh. That was sweet of her.

1473
00:53:43.723 --> 00:53:45.016
-Yeah.

1474
00:53:45.058 --> 00:53:45.642
[both chuckle awkwardly]

1475
00:53:45.684 --> 00:53:46.559
-Hi.

1476
00:53:46.601 --> 00:53:47.394
-Hey.

1477
00:53:47.435 --> 00:53:48.978
-Thank you for having me.

1478
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.231
I don't know if that's
a normal thing to do.

1479
00:53:51.272 --> 00:53:52.816
This is my very first Hanukkah.

1480
00:53:52.857 --> 00:53:53.900
-Yeah. Thank you.

1481
00:53:53.942 --> 00:53:54.943
It's my pleasure.

1482
00:53:54.984 --> 00:53:56.653
-Of course.

1483
00:53:56.695 --> 00:53:59.030
This is just a little something
to say that I've been. uh...

1484
00:53:59.072 --> 00:54:00.156
thinking about you.

1485
00:54:00.198 --> 00:54:02.492
-Thank you.
-It's my pleasure.

1486
00:54:02.534 --> 00:54:04.202
-I'm gonna go put these
in water.

1487
00:54:04.244 --> 00:54:05.203
-Oh. can you take mine too?

1488
00:54:05.245 --> 00:54:06.496
-Sure.
-Thank you.

1489
00:54:08.206 --> 00:54:09.040
-Hi.

1490
00:54:09.624 --> 00:54:10.417
-Hi.

1491
00:54:11.584 --> 00:54:13.586
Is it weird that I. uh...
I missed you?

1492
00:54:13.628 --> 00:54:16.589
-Hmm... no.
I kind of missed you too.

1493
00:54:18.049 --> 00:54:19.175
-Only kinda. huh?

1494
00:54:19.217 --> 00:54:20.844
-Just a little bit.

1495
00:54:20.885 --> 00:54:21.845
-Okay.

1496
00:54:23.471 --> 00:54:24.764
-[Mimi] Latkes are ready!

1497
00:54:28.435 --> 00:54:29.477
-You got something here.
let me get it.

1498
00:54:29.519 --> 00:54:32.355
-I do? What?
-I got it.

1499
00:54:32.397 --> 00:54:34.399
-I'll get us some latkes.
-Okay.

1500
00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.582
-I thought you were vegan.

1501
00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:56.546
-I am.

1502
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:59.507
-Well I hate to be
the bearer of bad news.

1503
00:54:59.549 --> 00:55:02.802
but lox isn't a vegetable.
Maybe you're a pescatarian.

1504
00:55:07.265 --> 00:55:08.475
-No. I'm definitely a vegan.

1505
00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:12.103
-[sniffs]

1506
00:55:12.145 --> 00:55:13.563
Then why do you reek
like fish?

1507
00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:22.906
-What?

1508
00:55:22.947 --> 00:55:23.907
-I saw Chris eating lox.

1509
00:55:23.948 --> 00:55:25.241
-So?

1510
00:55:25.283 --> 00:55:27.369
-So it means he's not a vegan.

1511
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:29.537
-Maybe he's a vegan who
eats fish occasionally.

1512
00:55:29.579 --> 00:55:31.456
-Yeah. A pescatarian.

1513
00:55:31.498 --> 00:55:33.291
But he says he's not
so he's lying.

1514
00:55:33.333 --> 00:55:34.834
-Why would anyone
lie about that?

1515
00:55:34.876 --> 00:55:36.086
-Exactly.

1516
00:55:36.127 --> 00:55:37.462
-Liz. you always do this.

1517
00:55:37.504 --> 00:55:38.588
-Do what? Out people
as pescatarians?

1518
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:40.131
-No. Have me not go
to the dance

1519
00:55:40.173 --> 00:55:42.008
so that you don't have
to stand there alone.

1520
00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:44.344
-Okay. All I'm saying is that
you don't really know Chris-

1521
00:55:44.386 --> 00:55:50.934
-mas.
Oh. Christmas tree.

1522
00:55:50.975 --> 00:55:51.976
-How... happy...

1523
00:55:52.018 --> 00:55:54.354
-No.
-No?

1524
00:55:54.396 --> 00:55:55.689
-Is this normal for Hanukkah?

1525
00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:58.066
-Just being inclusive.

1526
00:55:58.108 --> 00:56:01.277
-So. uh. Karly asked me about
using the Christmas decorations

1527
00:56:01.319 --> 00:56:02.779
for the Jingle Ball.

1528
00:56:02.821 --> 00:56:05.949
And I was thinking. if you'd
like. I could. uh...

1529
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:08.451
head up the decorating
committee.

1530
00:56:08.493 --> 00:56:10.120
I did do our senior year.

1531
00:56:10.161 --> 00:56:11.204
-Oh. that's so sweet.
-Yeah.

1532
00:56:11.246 --> 00:56:12.956
-I could help you if you want.
-Okay.

1533
00:56:12.997 --> 00:56:14.499
-I mean. Liz already said
she doesn't need my help.

1534
00:56:16.042 --> 00:56:16.876
-Sure.

1535
00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.671
-Cheers.
-Mmm.

1536
00:56:19.713 --> 00:56:21.172
-Cheers.
-To latkes.

1537
00:56:21.214 --> 00:56:22.132
-This looks good.
-Yeah.

1538
00:56:27.387 --> 00:56:29.055
-Oh. Thank you for
[clears throat]...

1539
00:56:29.097 --> 00:56:30.473
whatever this is.

1540
00:56:30.515 --> 00:56:31.766
-It's a handmade birch Menorah

1541
00:56:31.808 --> 00:56:33.852
that took me several hours
to make.

1542
00:56:33.893 --> 00:56:35.311
-I actually have a little
Hanukkah gift for you.

1543
00:56:35.353 --> 00:56:37.063
-Oh.

1544
00:56:37.105 --> 00:56:38.857
-I fixed our holiday card.

1545
00:56:38.898 --> 00:56:40.066
-How?

1546
00:56:40.108 --> 00:56:41.276
-You're in it now.

1547
00:56:41.317 --> 00:56:43.236
-Yeah. in the corner
like an afterthought.

1548
00:56:43.278 --> 00:56:44.696
And my eyes are closed.

1549
00:56:45.947 --> 00:56:48.074
-Believe me. it was the best one
in the bunch.

1550
00:56:48.116 --> 00:56:50.368
You know. nothing I do is
good enough for you. Is it?

1551
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:52.328
-Why do you always say that?

1552
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:54.080
-It's so nice to have an evening
where everybody gets along.

1553
00:56:54.122 --> 00:56:55.498
Isn't it?

1554
00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.250
It's a party after all.

1555
00:56:57.292 --> 00:56:58.835
Maybe it's. uh. time to light
the candles. don't you think?

1556
00:56:58.877 --> 00:57:01.755
Everybody. we're gonna light
the candles now!

1557
00:57:01.796 --> 00:57:03.465
And then we're gonna have a
dreidel contest for the ages.

1558
00:57:03.506 --> 00:57:04.924
So come on over
to the table.

1559
00:57:06.718 --> 00:57:09.554
-Thank you so much
for joining us tonight.

1560
00:57:09.596 --> 00:57:10.889
We are so happy
to be together.

1561
00:57:12.557 --> 00:57:13.475
-Would you like
to say something?

1562
00:57:13.516 --> 00:57:15.143
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

1563
00:57:15.185 --> 00:57:17.270
-Okay. Um...

1564
00:57:17.312 --> 00:57:20.315
I know a lot of you don't know
what Hanukkah is about

1565
00:57:20.357 --> 00:57:24.694
but it's the festival of lights.
The season of miracles.

1566
00:57:24.736 --> 00:57:27.364
It's a celebration
of the spirit's ability

1567
00:57:27.405 --> 00:57:29.115
to find light in darkness.

1568
00:57:29.157 --> 00:57:33.536
It's a time of connection.
dedication. rededication.

1569
00:57:33.578 --> 00:57:35.038
which is the meaning
of Hanukkah.

1570
00:57:36.247 --> 00:57:37.040

1576
00:57:59.979 --> 00:58:01.189
-So close. one more.
No. two more.

1577
00:58:01.231 --> 00:58:03.024
-Oh!
-Oh.

1578
00:58:03.066 --> 00:58:04.067
-Hi. What's up?

1579
00:58:06.444 --> 00:58:11.324
-We have considered your offer
and would like to counter...

1580
00:58:11.366 --> 00:58:16.162
-Okay. Sure.
Thanks.

1581
00:58:16.204 --> 00:58:18.331
-What's wrong?

1582
00:58:18.373 --> 00:58:21.251
-That was the VC firm.
they're not giving us funding.

1583
00:58:21.292 --> 00:58:22.627
-Huh.

1584
00:58:22.669 --> 00:58:24.129
-Instead they wanna
buy Best Pal.

1585
00:58:35.682 --> 00:58:37.642
I don't wanna sell Best Pal.

1586
00:58:37.684 --> 00:58:39.436
It's not just my work.
it's my life.

1587
00:58:39.477 --> 00:58:40.979
my entire sense of identity.

1588
00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:43.732
-Well then maybe
our identities change.

1589
00:58:43.773 --> 00:58:44.733
-To what?

1590
00:58:44.774 --> 00:58:46.484
-I don't know.

1591
00:58:46.526 --> 00:58:48.361
I mean. you start a new company.

1592
00:58:48.403 --> 00:58:49.654
You're always thinking
of new ideas.

1593
00:58:49.696 --> 00:58:50.530
you're jotting them down.

1594
00:58:50.572 --> 00:58:52.157
-I don't get it.

1595
00:58:52.198 --> 00:58:54.284
Since when are you so eager
to leave Best Pal?

1596
00:58:54.325 --> 00:58:55.201
-I'm not!

1597
00:58:57.912 --> 00:58:59.456
I just think that maybe
we could both benefit

1598
00:58:59.497 --> 00:59:01.249
from something new.

1599
00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:06.004
-But something new together?

-Hey Mom.

1605
01:00:04.979 --> 01:00:06.356
-Good morning.

1606
01:00:06.398 --> 01:00:07.691
You can help me
with the stuffing.

1607
01:00:07.732 --> 01:00:10.568
I'm prepping Christmas dinner.

1608
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.487
You told me I'd need
the pans.

1609
01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:14.739
-Sometimes I'm right.

1610
01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:16.783
-So honey. I wanted
to talk to you.

1611
01:00:16.825 --> 01:00:18.243
I gave our conversation
more thought

1612
01:00:18.284 --> 01:00:21.246
and I realized your concerns
are valid.

1613
01:00:21.287 --> 01:00:24.833
California is expensive.
amongst other things.

1614
01:00:24.874 --> 01:00:26.751
-Yay!

1615
01:00:26.793 --> 01:00:28.753
So you're not moving then?

1616
01:00:28.795 --> 01:00:31.589
-No. of course I'm moving.
But I had an even better idea.

1617
01:00:32.799 --> 01:00:35.510
I could move in with you.

1618
01:00:35.552 --> 01:00:38.221
Now I know it's not conventional
but it makes so much sense.

1619
01:00:38.263 --> 01:00:41.099
Why pay for two places
when we can split one?

1620
01:00:41.141 --> 01:00:42.600
So I'll sell the house.
you sell your condo.

1621
01:00:42.642 --> 01:00:45.103
and we'll pool our resources
to buy a house together.

1622
01:00:46.604 --> 01:00:50.108
-Both of us. One roof.

1623
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:51.484
-What. you don't wanna live
with me?

1624
01:00:53.278 --> 01:00:55.238
-I mean. did you wanna live
with your mother?

1625
01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.741
-Yeah. but she's my mom.
and I'm me.

1626
01:00:57.782 --> 01:00:59.492
It's totally different.

1627
01:00:59.534 --> 01:01:00.618
-What's different is you're
the daughter in that situation

1628
01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.037
and I'm the daughter
in this situation.

1629
01:01:03.997 --> 01:01:07.375
-So you don't wanna live
with me?

I love you but we are not
moving in together.

01:01:17.844 --> 01:01:19.095
-Hmm.

1635
01:01:27.979 --> 01:01:29.647
-How's the salmon?

1636
01:01:29.689 --> 01:01:31.066
-It's so good.

1637
01:01:32.359 --> 01:01:33.818
Sorry.

1638
01:01:34.652 --> 01:01:38.365
-Oh. no. No. no.
This pasta is. uh... incredible.

1639
01:01:38.406 --> 01:01:39.491
-Good.

1640
01:01:39.532 --> 01:01:40.492
-Yeah. it's really good.

1641
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:43.078
Look...

1642
01:01:44.913 --> 01:01:45.789
I wanna talk to you
about something.

1643
01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:47.332
-Okay.

1644
01:01:47.374 --> 01:01:49.167
-I know you head home
in a few days but. uh...

1645

want this to end.

-[sighs]

1647
01:01:57.092 --> 01:01:58.510
-This feels like it could be
something real.

1648
01:01:59.844 --> 01:02:02.514
-Yeah.
No. I... I feel that too.

1649

[both chuckle]

1650
01:02:07.227 --> 01:02:10.647
But I mean.
hopeless romanticism aside.

1651
01:02:10.689 --> 01:02:12.440
how does this work?

1652
01:02:15.276 --> 01:02:18.530
-I think. um... we could do
long distance.

1653
01:02:18.571 --> 01:02:19.322
-Yeah.

1654
01:02:19.364 --> 01:02:20.782
-For a while.
-Yeah.

1655
01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:23.493
-And if. uh... that works...

1656
01:02:23.535 --> 01:02:25.620
one of us could move
potentially. I suppose.

1657
01:02:25.662 --> 01:02:27.580
-Yeah. Okay.

1658
01:02:27.622 --> 01:02:30.959
Okay. so... in this
potential situation...

1659
01:02:31.001 --> 01:02:32.377
-Mm-hmm.

1660
01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:34.212
-Would you think about
moving to California?

1661
01:02:35.714 --> 01:02:37.549
-Yeah.

1662
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:38.633
-Okay.

1663
01:02:38.675 --> 01:02:39.801

1664
01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:41.720
-Or...

1665
01:02:41.761 --> 01:02:44.639
in this potential. totally
hypothetical situation

1666
01:02:44.681 --> 01:02:48.226
it would probably make more
sense for you to move back here.

1667
01:02:48.268 --> 01:02:49.936
-Move back to Weston?

1668
01:02:49.978 --> 01:02:51.354
-Yeah.

1669
01:02:51.396 --> 01:02:52.439
Why not?

1670
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:55.525
-Okay. Okay.

1671
01:02:55.567 --> 01:02:57.694
Well. what is the reality
of that?

1672
01:02:57.736 --> 01:02:59.696
I mean. what would I...
what would I do?

1673
01:02:59.738 --> 01:03:01.322
Where would I work?

1674
01:03:01.364 --> 01:03:04.367
-Well if you sell the company.
you could take the. uh...

1675
01:03:04.409 --> 01:03:06.578
the seed money and start
something new.

1676
01:03:06.619 --> 01:03:07.912
-Oh.

1677
01:03:07.954 --> 01:03:10.248
-You could open the bakery.
Start the flower shop.

1678
01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:12.834
-Well. those are just my kid
dreams. I mean. I...

1679
01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:14.127
-So?

1680
01:03:14.169 --> 01:03:16.504
-So... you know.

1681
01:03:16.546 --> 01:03:18.798
10-year-old Naomi didn't need
health insurance.

1682
01:03:20.467 --> 01:03:22.761
-Neither does 35-year-old Naomi.
I don't think.

1683
01:03:22.802 --> 01:03:25.722
But. uh... look. we don't have
to do this. um...

1684
01:03:25.764 --> 01:03:27.932
we were just romantic
fantasizing. Okay?

1685
01:03:27.974 --> 01:03:29.392
-Yes. Yeah. absolutely.

1686
01:03:32.354 --> 01:03:36.900
It's just all happening so fast.
I mean. I didn't expect you.

1687
01:03:36.941 --> 01:03:39.361
And we've been
on three dates and...

It's a little warm in here.
um...

1690
01:03:46.159 --> 01:03:47.118
I'll be right back. Okay?

1691
01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.495
-Sure. Yeah.

1692
01:03:56.419 --> 01:03:58.296

1695
01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:04.094
Look. Chris just dropped
a bomb on me

1696
01:04:04.135 --> 01:04:05.387
and I don't know what to do.

1697
01:04:05.428 --> 01:04:06.680
And I know that you're right

1698
01:04:06.721 --> 01:04:09.516
and I know that I don't know him
all that well.

1699
01:04:09.557 --> 01:04:11.309
But also I've known him
for 20 years

1700
01:04:11.351 --> 01:04:12.977
and he's kinda the man
of my dreams.

1701
01:04:13.019 --> 01:04:14.229
And I just... I don't know.

1702
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:15.563
What if this is it?

1703
01:04:15.605 --> 01:04:17.565
You know.
what if he's the one?

1704
01:04:17.607 --> 01:04:21.152
And... and I lose it
because I doubted it.

1705
01:04:21.194 --> 01:04:22.237
Just call me back.

1706
01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:44.217
-Yeah.

1707
01:04:55.687 --> 01:04:57.814
-Well. the letter
of intent is solid.

1708
01:04:57.856 --> 01:05:00.817
Our employees get to keep
their jobs. we cash out.

1709
01:05:00.859 --> 01:05:03.319
have enough runway to figure
out what we wanna do next.

1710
01:05:03.361 --> 01:05:04.988
-Naomi. what else would I do?

1711
01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:08.408
-Maybe you go back to school.
get your masters.

1712
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:10.702
Go to Stanford.

1713
01:05:10.744 --> 01:05:13.455
I mean. you always wanted to go
but you didn't get in. Right?

1714
01:05:13.496 --> 01:05:14.164
-I don't understand this.

1715
01:05:14.205 --> 01:05:15.665
All of a sudden

1716
01:05:15.707 --> 01:05:16.499
you're so interested
in doing something else.

1717
01:05:16.541 --> 01:05:17.792
-It's not all of a sudden.

1718
01:05:17.834 --> 01:05:19.502
I've been feeling this way
for a long time.

1719
01:05:19.544 --> 01:05:21.004
-Then why didn't
you say anything?

1720
01:05:21.046 --> 01:05:24.883
-I did say something and you
told me to pivot Best Pal.

1721
01:05:24.924 --> 01:05:27.677
to expand. and that
brought us here.

1722
01:05:27.719 --> 01:05:30.597
So... maybe this is
meant to be.

1723
01:05:32.432 --> 01:05:35.894
-Well whatever it is. we'll
figure it out together. Right?

1724
01:05:35.935 --> 01:05:36.728
-Right.

1725
01:05:43.276 --> 01:05:44.944
-Oh. can we pop in
for a second?

1726
01:05:44.986 --> 01:05:46.529
Our Jingle Ball dresses
are here.

1727
01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:48.281
-You got us dresses?
-Yeah!

I really appreciate it.

are in the back.

-Hey.

-This feels weird.

1735

-It is weird.

1736
01:06:07.258 --> 01:06:09.052
You know. I wanna be with you.
you don't wanna be with me.

1737
01:06:09.094 --> 01:06:10.595
-That's not what I said.

1738
01:06:10.637 --> 01:06:11.763
-Eh. it's the short version
of what you said.

1739
01:06:11.805 --> 01:06:13.139
-Can we just talk this through?
I mean...

1740
01:06:13.181 --> 01:06:14.265
-No. I think we're good.

1741
01:06:14.307 --> 01:06:15.725
-Really?
-Yeah. we're good.

1742

01:15:06.381 --> 01:15:08.049
-This looks fantastic.
-Thanks.

1913
01:15:09.884 --> 01:15:11.553
-Blast from the past.

1914
01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:12.929
It should come with
a trigger warning.

1915
01:15:12.971 --> 01:15:13.555
-[laughs]

1916
01:15:17.017 --> 01:15:18.435
-You okay?

1917
01:15:19.102 --> 01:15:20.895
-Yeah. No. I'm fine.

1918
01:15:23.356 --> 01:15:24.566
-What's going on?

1919
01:15:26.234 --> 01:15:28.695
-Naomi and I got into a fight.

1920
01:15:28.737 --> 01:15:29.988
-Oh.

1921
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:31.072
-A big one.

1922
01:15:32.907 --> 01:15:35.118
-Well you guys have been
friends forever. you know.

1923
01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.745
You don't achieve that

1924
01:15:36.786 --> 01:15:39.414
without being able to make it
through anything.

1925
01:15:39.456 --> 01:15:42.876
-Yeah. It's not just
a fight though.

1926
01:15:42.917 --> 01:15:44.753
Things have been changing
for a while.

1927
01:15:46.921 --> 01:15:48.381
-Yeah.

1928
01:15:48.423 --> 01:15:50.717
I think sometimes things
need to change.

1929
01:15:50.759 --> 01:15:53.428
Can't keep living our lives
clinging to what we used to be.

1930
01:15:54.637 --> 01:15:56.431
-Yeah. That's true.

1931
01:15:57.182 --> 01:16:01.644
I worry though.
What if Naomi doesn't need me?

1932
01:16:01.686 --> 01:16:04.898
I mean. she's my best friend
but she's also the only person

1933
01:16:04.939 --> 01:16:09.235
who's ever made me feel seen.
made me feel like I belong.

1934
01:16:09.277 --> 01:16:11.780
Made me feel like...

1935
01:16:14.074 --> 01:16:14.908
[chuckles]

1936
01:16:14.949 --> 01:16:16.910
-Like what?

1937
01:16:16.951 --> 01:16:18.578
-Like I'd been Chris'd.

1938
01:16:20.955 --> 01:16:22.082
-What?

1939
01:16:22.123 --> 01:16:24.250
-Sorry. you had to be there.

1940
01:16:24.292 --> 01:16:25.126
-Sounds like I was there.

1941
01:16:25.168 --> 01:16:26.920
-[laughs]

1942
01:16:26.961 --> 01:16:27.671
[sighs]

1943
01:16:29.756 --> 01:16:31.925
You're a good guy. Chris.

1944
01:16:31.966 --> 01:16:32.592
-Yeah.

1945
01:16:34.427 --> 01:16:35.637
Thank you.

1946
01:16:37.514 --> 01:16:42.227
To be honest...
I sometimes am a pescatarian.

1947
01:16:42.268 --> 01:16:42.977
-[gasps]

1948
01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:44.896
I knew it.

1949
01:16:44.938 --> 01:16:46.564
-I know you knew.

1950
01:16:46.606 --> 01:16:47.774
-Nice try though.

1951
01:16:47.816 --> 01:16:48.817
-Thank you.

1952
01:16:50.068 --> 01:16:50.985
We'll figure it out.

1953
01:16:52.487 --> 01:16:54.614
-Yeah. You're right.

1954
01:16:55.782 --> 01:16:58.493
*

1955
01:16:58.535 --> 01:17:01.830
* ...would know
my Christmas list is *

1956
01:17:01.871 --> 01:17:04.457
* Someone who could
give me hugs and kisses *

1957
01:17:04.499 --> 01:17:07.335
* Oh. oh. oh.*

1958
01:17:07.377 --> 01:17:08.586
* Santa. you know. oh. oh.*

1959
01:17:08.628 --> 01:17:09.754
[glasses clink]

1960
01:17:10.213 --> 01:17:11.131
-You want a shot with us?
-Yeah.

1961
01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:13.299
-Say merry!

1962
01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:14.592
[all together]
Merry!

1963
01:17:14.634 --> 01:17:16.136
[all laughing]

1964

*

1965

*

1966
01:17:18.388 --> 01:17:20.724
-Hey.
-You look amazing.

1967
01:17:20.765 --> 01:17:22.642
-Thank you.
So do you.

1968
01:17:22.684 --> 01:17:24.310
-I couldn't have done it
without you.

1969
01:17:24.352 --> 01:17:26.146
-Well I was happy to help.

1970
01:17:26.187 --> 01:17:27.689
Oh. So I talked to Chris

1971
01:17:27.731 --> 01:17:30.275
about the whole queen
and king thing and...

1972
01:17:30.316 --> 01:17:31.735
we decided it'll be fun.

1973
01:17:31.776 --> 01:17:33.153
-Great!

1974
01:17:33.194 --> 01:17:35.405
Well. I'll make a little speech
and then coronate you.

1975
01:17:35.447 --> 01:17:36.865
-Okay. Awesome!

1976
01:17:36.906 --> 01:17:37.657
[glasses clink]

1977
01:17:39.409 --> 01:17:42.704
* Outside the snow
is falling down *

1978
01:17:42.746 --> 01:17:45.915
* ...I'm just wishing
you were here now. *

1979
01:17:45.957 --> 01:17:49.711
* Dreaming that I could have
true love this year *

1980
01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:52.047
* That's what I want
for Christmas *

1981
01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:53.214
-Hey.

1982
01:17:58.094 --> 01:17:59.721
-Wow.

1983
01:17:59.763 --> 01:18:00.680
Hey.

1984
01:18:02.932 --> 01:18:04.642
-[sighs]

1985
01:18:04.684 --> 01:18:06.394
Listen. I just wanted
to say that...

1986
01:18:06.436 --> 01:18:10.899
that night at the restaurant.
when you brought up our future

1987
01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:18.823
and long distance. it sounded
terrifying and illogical.

1988
01:18:18.865 --> 01:18:21.534
And also like something
I would do.

1989
01:18:21.576 --> 01:18:24.537
Something I would
wanna do.

1990
01:18:24.579 --> 01:18:27.374
And I just got scared.

1991
01:18:27.415 --> 01:18:30.835
Because sometimes
I can romanticize...

1992
01:18:30.877 --> 01:18:34.130
and I just didn't wanna
get hurt.

1993
01:18:34.172 --> 01:18:37.634
-I'm glad you told me that
'cause honestly at the time

1994
01:18:37.676 --> 01:18:40.387
it felt like you were just
straight rejecting me.

1995
01:18:41.221 --> 01:18:43.973
Which I think we've learned
that I am deeply insecure

1996
01:18:44.015 --> 01:18:46.267
and that I'm not the best
with rejection.

1997
01:18:48.853 --> 01:18:50.605
-Especially coming from you.

1998
01:18:52.691 --> 01:18:54.734
'Cause with you I felt like
Chris Silver again.

1999
01:18:55.819 --> 01:18:59.739
-Chris. you've always
been Chris Silver.

2000
01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:02.951
And you always will be.
Especially to me.

2001
01:19:06.955 --> 01:19:12.627
So... do you think we can try
to figure this out?

2002
01:19:13.795 --> 01:19:16.715
* ... my world like
a snow globe  *

2003
01:19:16.756 --> 01:19:20.760
* Suddenly everything
is so cold*

2004
01:19:20.802 --> 01:19:24.931
* Got me head over heels
while in love *

2005
01:19:24.973 --> 01:19:28.101
* can't even tell
which way is up*

2006
01:19:28.143 --> 01:19:29.894
* So close

2007
01:19:29.936 --> 01:19:33.940
* Everything shimmers
in your globe *

2008
01:19:33.982 --> 01:19:38.695
* Baby do it again and never
let go *

2009
01:19:38.737 --> 01:19:41.281
* Keep shaking my world
like a snow globe *

2010
01:19:41.322 --> 01:19:43.199
-Only if occasionally I can have
a bit of fish.

2011
01:19:43.241 --> 01:19:44.993
-[laughs]

2012
01:19:45.035 --> 01:19:46.119
-Okay?

2013
01:19:46.161 --> 01:19:47.120
-Deal.

2014
01:19:48.955 --> 01:19:50.665
-Hi. Hello.
-[microphone feedback]

2015
01:19:50.707 --> 01:19:53.209
Can I get everybody's attention?

2016
01:19:53.251 --> 01:19:54.294
Merry Christmas!

2018
01:19:57.047 --> 01:19:57.881
-Oww!

2019
01:20:01.009 --> 01:20:02.969
-Thank you for letting me
host this dance

2020
01:20:03.011 --> 01:20:05.638
and thank you so much to
everybody who helped me out.

2021
01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:08.475
Believe it or not.
in high school

2022
01:20:08.516 --> 01:20:14.439
I dreamt of hosting this dance
and 17 years later... I did it.

2023
01:20:14.481 --> 01:20:16.191
[cheering and applause]

2024
01:20:18.943 --> 01:20:21.112
Anyway. without further ado.

2025
01:20:21.154 --> 01:20:23.656
it is my great pleasure
to announce

2026
01:20:23.698 --> 01:20:25.909
this year's Jingle Ball king...

2027
01:20:27.786 --> 01:20:29.079
-Come here. come here.

2028
01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.747
-Sorry. just give me
one moment.

2029
01:20:30.789 --> 01:20:31.956
What is it?

2030
01:20:31.998 --> 01:20:33.333
-I've changed my mind.

2031
01:20:33.375 --> 01:20:35.001
I mean. I know it's not
a big deal or anything.

2032
01:20:35.043 --> 01:20:39.589
but the truth is I don't care
about any of it at all.

2033
01:20:39.631 --> 01:20:42.717
Because I realized...
I don't need a redo.

2034
01:20:47.347 --> 01:20:48.765
-I don't either.

2035
01:20:52.143 --> 01:20:53.353
[clears throat]

2036
01:20:53.395 --> 01:20:55.689
Sorry about that.

2037
01:20:55.730 --> 01:20:59.818
There has been a slight change
of plans.

2038
01:20:59.859 --> 01:21:01.861
We're no longer doing
Jingle Ball king and queen.

2039
01:21:01.903 --> 01:21:03.405
We're gonna reschedule it
to next year.

2040

[crowd awes]

2041
01:21:04.906 --> 01:21:07.534
Anyway. so... who wants
to party?

-Whoo!

[laughing]

2046
01:21:19.212 --> 01:21:21.089
-Hey.
-Hey.

2047
01:21:21.131 --> 01:21:23.133
-You wore the dress.
-Of course.

2048
01:21:23.174 --> 01:21:25.218
-You wore yours.
-Of course.

2049
01:21:27.929 --> 01:21:29.931
-Wow. for the first time
I don't actually know

2050
01:21:29.973 --> 01:21:31.266
what to say to you.

2051
01:21:32.726 --> 01:21:36.479
I mean. I think you're right.
We should sell Best Pal.

2052
01:21:36.521 --> 01:21:37.897
-You can buy me out.

2053
01:21:37.939 --> 01:21:40.567
-No. I need to do something
different too.

2054
01:21:40.608 --> 01:21:42.235
Not crypto. I promise.

2055
01:21:42.277 --> 01:21:42.819
-Good.

2056
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:46.865
Well I hope that even
if we need space

2057
01:21:46.906 --> 01:21:48.783
we can somehow
do it together.

2058
01:21:49.367 --> 01:21:50.785
-But can we?

2059
01:21:52.287 --> 01:21:54.914
I mean. I want you to have
everything you want in life

2060
01:21:54.956 --> 01:21:56.583
and I don't wanna get
in the way.

2061
01:21:56.624 --> 01:21:58.084
-No. that's just it. Liz.

2062
01:21:58.126 --> 01:22:00.462
Everything I want in life
involves you being there

2063
01:22:00.503 --> 01:22:02.589
to share it with me.

2064
01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:07.802
Because when I think of my past.
and my present. my future...

2065
01:22:07.844 --> 01:22:12.307
you had to be there.
You have to be there.

2066
01:22:12.349 --> 01:22:14.601
-You know that I think
the statistical probability

2067
01:22:14.642 --> 01:22:16.227
of soulmates is limiting.

2068
01:22:16.269 --> 01:22:17.812
-[laughs]

2069
01:22:17.854 --> 01:22:21.983
-But... I think they come
in many different forms.

2070
01:22:22.025 --> 01:22:25.862
Even if I had the chance to redo
my life over a thousand times

2071
01:22:25.904 --> 01:22:28.365
I wouldn't because I wouldn't
change anything

2072
01:22:28.406 --> 01:22:29.741
to be your friend.

2073
01:22:29.783 --> 01:22:32.952
-Wow. we are really good
at this.

2074
01:22:32.994 --> 01:22:34.871
-I know. we should fight
more often.

2075
01:22:36.498 --> 01:22:40.210
So... friends?

2076
01:22:40.251 --> 01:22:40.960
-Besties.

2077
01:22:46.508 --> 01:22:47.467
