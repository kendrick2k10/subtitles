Sam-

- [Annie] What?! Oh. god.

27
00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:02.402
- I'm so nervous.

28
00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:04.337
- Are you crazy? You're gonna
kill it.

29
00:03:05.438 --> 00:03:06.605
- I'll try.

30
00:03:06.638 --> 00:03:08.808
- Just enjoy it. You've
earned it.

31
00:03:09.842 --> 00:03:11.911
- It was yours though. Your
role.

32
00:03:11.944 --> 00:03:13.579
- And it's yours now.

33
00:03:13.612 --> 00:03:15.148
Hey. look what I bought.

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.751
Red shoes to celebrate.

00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:22.422
And I love you.

00:03:22.455 --> 00:03:24.123

- Okay.

39
00:03:25.425 --> 00:03:27.793

curtain drops

bow...

You know. like a. like a
chain.

78
00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:11.431
Yeah. like a chain.

79
00:05:11.464 --> 00:05:16.103
You know. every link is
like
this. never been broken.

80
00:05:17.437 --> 00:05:20.941
So. if we're part of that
system.

81
00:05:22.976 --> 00:05:25.580
we're already connected.

82
00:05:25.612 --> 00:05:26.447
Right?

83
00:05:28.815 --> 00:05:29.616
Huh.

84
00:05:30.483 --> 00:05:32.953
And since we're already
connected.

85
00:05:35.288 --> 00:05:38.291
well. your numbers should
already be in my cell.

86
00:05:38.324 --> 00:05:39.626
Hey.
- "Doctor Jackson's

87
00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.562
Principles of the
Universe"?

88
00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:42.930
- You got that off
YouTube?

89
00:05:43.796 --> 00:05:46.133
- It doesn't make it any less
true.

90
00:05:46.166 --> 00:05:47.734
- Loser.
(Sam laughs)

91
00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:50.103
- Wait. no. no. no.
Where are you guys going?

92
00:05:50.136 --> 00:05:51.905
All I said was good.
yeah?

93
00:05:51.938 --> 00:05:53.774
Wait. come back. I'm not
done.

94
00:05:56.109 --> 00:05:57.177
Was this close.

95
00:05:58.344 --> 00:06:00.448
(Freddy sighs)

96
00:06:00.481 --> 00:06:02.916
You know. maybe you and
I-
- Uh. okay.

97
00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.553
In your dreams. Freddy.

98
00:06:05.586 --> 00:06:06.588
- All right.

99
00:06:07.588 --> 00:06:09.923
(Sam laughs)

100
00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:11.224
- [Eve's Dad] What is going
on?!

101
00:06:11.257 --> 00:06:12.726
- Whoa.
- Eve!

102
00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:17.764
- [Freddy] Time to go.

103
00:06:28.107 --> 00:06:29.743
- Is your dad still mad?

104
00:06:29.776 --> 00:06:32.180
- [Eve] Who cares? Not
like we talk anyway.

105
00:06:33.146 --> 00:06:34.248
- [Sam] Ooh.

106
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:37.918
High Volume or Ultimate
Potion?

107
00:06:37.951 --> 00:06:40.221
- Oh. darling. Definitely
the Ultimate Potion.

108
00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:41.389
- [Sam] Oh. Try this.

109
00:06:41.422 --> 00:06:42.423
(can sprays)

110
00:06:42.456 --> 00:06:44.057
(Eve coughs)
(Eve chuckles)

111
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.560
- How do you wear that
stuff?

112
00:06:45.593 --> 00:06:47.761
- Well. when it's free...

113
00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:53.601
(Sam sighs)

114
00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:05.413
Wait. Was that paper due
today?

115
00:07:05.446 --> 00:07:07.415
- Yesterday. You skipped.
remember?

116
00:07:07.448 --> 00:07:10.117
- Aw. crap. Did you do
it?

117
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.586
- Yeah.

118
00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:13.588
I just wrote about
consumerism's influence

119
00:07:13.621 --> 00:07:14.921
on the female psyche.

120
00:07:14.955 --> 00:07:16.591
How none of us are ever
really good enough

121
00:07:16.624 --> 00:07:18.892
without the Diors or the
Chanels.

122
00:07:18.926 --> 00:07:20.895
- What? I'm so screwed.

123
00:07:20.928 --> 00:07:23.130
- Okay. way. way more
important than that.

124
00:07:23.163 --> 00:07:24.798
Freddy won't stop talking
about you.

125
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:26.766
- Uh. no thanks.

126
00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:28.936
- Oh. come on. he's cute.

127
00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:31.439
In like a not all there type
of way.

128
00:07:31.472 --> 00:07:33.407
- Yeah. definitely a big
no.

129
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.408
(both laughing)

130
00:07:34.441 --> 00:07:35.276
Thank you.

131
00:07:36.944 --> 00:07:39.981
- Oh. Yeah. not. not that
way.

132
00:07:42.616 --> 00:07:45.787
(gentle guitar music)

133
00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:51.892
(Sam yelps)
(body thuds)

134
00:07:51.925 --> 00:07:54.429
(Sam exhales)

135
00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:02.604
(Sam chuckles)

136
00:08:03.971 --> 00:08:07.074
- [Sam] 200 hours community
service.

137
00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:08.276
- Not again.

138
00:08:11.613 --> 00:08:13.582
- What do you think she's in
for?

139
00:08:13.615 --> 00:08:15.618
- Misdemeanour assault
with a curling iron.

140
00:08:17.619 --> 00:08:20.788
- I stabbed a barista with a
fork. You?

141
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:22.658
- Shoplifting.

142
00:08:23.658 --> 00:08:25.594
Let's go. Samantha.

143
00:08:25.627 --> 00:08:28.229
- Mom. I can't just
leave.
- No. it's fine. Sam.

144
00:08:28.262 --> 00:08:29.765
I'm sure my dad will turn up
soon.

145
00:08:29.797 --> 00:08:31.566
- [Jennifer] Samantha.

146
00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:32.768
- I'm fine. Sam.

147
00:08:35.102 --> 00:08:37.572
- Just make sure she doesn't
have a fork.

148
00:08:37.605 --> 00:08:38.939
(Eve chuckles)

149
00:08:38.972 --> 00:08:39.907
- Catch up soon.

150
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.310
- [Jennifer] I would prefer
you didn't.

151
00:08:42.343 --> 00:08:44.245
- Might have no choice. Mrs.
C.

152
00:08:44.278 --> 00:08:46.914
Looks like trash duty for
the next couple months.

153
00:08:46.947 --> 00:08:49.618
"Doing our part for a
cleaner. brighter
tomorrow."

154
00:08:50.652 --> 00:08:52.120
- Now. Samantha.

155
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.155
- Sorry.

156
00:08:59.927 --> 00:09:03.398
- So. how big was the
fork?

157
00:09:03.431 --> 00:09:08.437
(water boiling)
(kettle whistling)

158
00:09:09.937 --> 00:09:12.307
(kettle clicks)

159
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.842
(door closes)

160
00:09:15.843 --> 00:09:18.447
(coffee pours)

161
00:09:20.114 --> 00:09:21.684
- It's all arranged.

162
00:09:24.819 --> 00:09:26.322
- Sure this is a good
idea?

163
00:09:28.256 --> 00:09:29.791
- Want her picking up trash
by the highway

164
00:09:29.824 --> 00:09:32.594
the rest of her life with
that Eve girl?

165
00:09:34.763 --> 00:09:36.931
- I just don't want her to
hurt anymore.

166
00:09:38.266 --> 00:09:39.101
- Neither do I.

167
00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:43.572
I think this is the
only choice we have left

168
00:09:43.605 --> 00:09:45.174
if we don't want to lose her
too.

169
00:09:47.275 --> 00:09:50.346
(sombre piano music)

170
00:10:00.588 --> 00:10:01.423
- Wait.

171
00:10:02.957 --> 00:10:03.925
Where are we going?

172
00:10:05.794 --> 00:10:06.628
Mom.

173
00:10:07.894 --> 00:10:10.065
- I'm not having you pick
up
trash under some
overpass.

174
00:10:10.098 --> 00:10:11.400
- No-
- I'm not having you

175
00:10:11.433 --> 00:10:13.769
fall into that life.
- No. I'm not dancing.

176
00:10:13.802 --> 00:10:15.070
Mom. stop the car.

177
00:10:15.103 --> 00:10:17.572
- [Jennifer] It's too late.
It's decided.

178
00:10:17.605 --> 00:10:18.573
- No. I won't dance.

179
00:10:18.606 --> 00:10:20.108
I'm...

180
00:10:20.141 --> 00:10:23.945
It's not gonna happen. I
can't. not without Annie.

181
00:10:23.978 --> 00:10:25.681
- You're not going there to
dance.

182
00:10:26.781 --> 00:10:28.450
You're going there to
finish your schoolwork.

183
00:10:28.483 --> 00:10:30.119
And bring the Sam I know
back.

184
00:10:31.753 --> 00:10:33.288
When you're not doing
your
schoolwork. you're
cleaning.

185
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:34.589
That's your community
service.

186
00:10:34.622 --> 00:10:35.423
- Mom. I-
- This way.

187
00:10:35.456 --> 00:10:36.893
you get it done faster in a
safe.

188
00:10:36.925 --> 00:10:39.561
familiar environment
with upstanding people.

189
00:10:39.594 --> 00:10:42.097
- I don't want "familiar" or
"upstanding."

190
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.265
I-
- There's still an entire

191
00:10:43.298 --> 00:10:47.636
future ahead for you.
Samantha. don't you get
it?

192
00:10:52.106 --> 00:10:54.576
- I don't get a choice in it
though?

193
00:10:54.609 --> 00:10:56.913
I mean. did you even think
about

194
00:10:56.945 --> 00:10:58.480
how hard this would be for
me?

195
00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:05.287
Unbelievable.

196
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.896
(emergency brake creaks)

197
00:11:13.929 --> 00:11:17.065
(Jennifer sighs)

198
00:11:17.098 --> 00:11:19.168
- You do have a choice.
Samantha.

199
00:11:20.603 --> 00:11:24.105
You either go in there.
clean mirrors. mop
floors.

200
00:11:24.138 --> 00:11:27.109
and be true to you. the
girl I know and raised.

201
00:11:28.777 --> 00:11:32.615
or you wait till I'm
gone.
pick up garbage with Eve.

202
00:11:34.115 --> 00:11:36.318

yourself thrown in jail.

204
00:11:38.787 --> 00:11:40.322
It's for the best. Sam.

205
00:11:42.458 --> 00:11:43.292

(Sam sighs)

212
00:12:31.807 --> 00:12:32.775
- Samantha.

213
00:12:34.276 --> 00:12:35.411
It's so great to see you.

214
00:12:35.444 --> 00:12:38.080
- It's good to see you too.
Ms. Levison.

215
00:12:38.113 --> 00:12:39.081
- Sammy.

216
00:12:39.114 --> 00:12:40.583
Oh. my gosh.
- Hey. Paige.

217
00:12:40.616 --> 00:12:42.251
- [Paige] Hey. It's so good
to see you.

218
00:12:42.284 --> 00:12:43.252
- Hi.
- Hey.

219
00:12:43.285 --> 00:12:45.621
- [Paige] Oh. my gosh.
It's been all too long.

220
00:12:45.654 --> 00:12:47.223
- We saw her yesterday.

221
00:12:47.256 --> 00:12:49.425
- Andrea. Instagram doesn't
count.

222
00:12:49.458 --> 00:12:51.727
- No. TikTok.

223
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.729
- Ha.
(Hannah chuckles)

224
00:12:53.762 --> 00:12:54.797
It's so good to have you
back.

225
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.065
Hasn't been the same without
you.

226
00:12:56.098 --> 00:12:59.235
- Yes. You have far too
much talent not to be
here.

227
00:12:59.268 --> 00:13:00.436
Oh. where are your bags?

228
00:13:00.469 --> 00:13:03.739
- Oh. I'm not. um.
staying.

229
00:13:03.772 --> 00:13:06.742
Um. I'm just finishing
out
the school year. Not
boarding.

230
00:13:06.775 --> 00:13:09.111
- [Paige] Not boarding? So.
not dancing?

231
00:13:09.144 --> 00:13:10.613
- [Ms. Harlow] Not
dancing.

232
00:13:12.181 --> 00:13:13.449
- We're gonna go.
- Mm.

233
00:13:13.482 --> 00:13:15.251
(Paige mumbling)
- That way. Okay.

234
00:13:15.284 --> 00:13:16.786
- Samantha is here as a
favour.

235
00:13:17.954 --> 00:13:19.789
But there are rules.

236
00:13:19.823 --> 00:13:23.426
You will attend your
classes. All of your
classes.

237
00:13:23.459 --> 00:13:24.594
You will clean studios

238
00:13:24.627 --> 00:13:27.630
and performance spaces during
your breaks.

239
00:13:27.663 --> 00:13:30.901
And you will under no
circumstances distract my
students

240
00:13:30.934 --> 00:13:32.635
from reaching their full
potential.

241
00:13:33.937 --> 00:13:35.137
Do I make myself clear?

242
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.073
- [Sam] Yes.

243
00:13:36.105 --> 00:13:37.573
- Yes?

244
00:13:37.606 --> 00:13:38.809
- Yes. Ms. Harlow.

245
00:13:42.846 --> 00:13:43.948
Ms. Harlow. I'm...

246
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:50.621

00:17:02.947 --> 00:17:05.082
Um. Sam. what are you
doing?

306
00:17:05.115 --> 00:17:07.317

307
00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.588
Short one. actually.

308
00:17:10.621 --> 00:17:12.557
- Everyone seems to be coming
back.

309
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:13.892
- Have you seen Ben?

310
00:17:13.925 --> 00:17:15.726
- Yeah. I heard he was
kicked
out of the Australian
Company.

311
00:17:15.759 --> 00:17:17.295
- What?
- Wait. What?

312
00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:19.130
- [Paige] Yeah. no one
knows
why Harlow brought him
back.

313
00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:21.399
- Oh. I have a guess.

314
00:17:21.432 --> 00:17:23.067
- He was always one of her
favourites.

315
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.569
- Exactly.

316
00:17:24.602 --> 00:17:26.404
- Anyway. we should get back
to rehearsal.

317
00:17:26.437 --> 00:17:28.606
Come by later? We have
a tonne to catch up on.

318
00:17:28.639 --> 00:17:29.907

- Oh!
- Oh!

322
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:33.444
Be careful.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.989

rehearsing "Cinderella."

00:18:34.605 --> 00:18:35.607
I like Prokofiev.

331
00:18:36.473 --> 00:18:37.309
- Ben.

332
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.844
You're back.

333
00:18:41.146 --> 00:18:43.781
- You can leave. but
you're never really gone.

334
00:18:46.284 --> 00:18:47.119
- Yeah.

335
00:18:48.153 --> 00:18:51.089
Uh. so I heard you got in
some trouble.

336
00:18:51.122 --> 00:18:52.457
- You and me both.

337
00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:55.559
- [Sam] Missed a step?

338
00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:57.062
- I wish.

339
00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:58.796
Stayed out late and missed
half the day.

340
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.664
- Ooh.

341
00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:02.935
- Harlow pulled some
strings to get me back.

342
00:19:03.767 --> 00:19:05.237
She thinks a company member
might attract

343
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.907
a more "esteemed
audience."

344
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.942
- Yeah.

345
00:19:09.975 --> 00:19:11.609
Probably a good idea
after.

346
00:19:13.345 --> 00:19:14.146
after last year.
- Hey.

347
00:19:14.179 --> 00:19:15.280
No one blames you for
that.

348
00:19:15.313 --> 00:19:17.416
- Well. Harlow. um.
Gracie-

349
00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:18.284
- Well. I don't.

350
00:19:19.818 --> 00:19:21.619
Not after what you've been
through.

351
00:19:24.923 --> 00:19:27.726
- It was supposed to be
Annie's role. you know?

352
00:19:27.759 --> 00:19:29.061
- She was picked up for
City.

353
00:19:29.094 --> 00:19:31.964
She left. Sam. with Harlow's
blessing.

354
00:19:33.098 --> 00:19:34.433
And Harlow picked you to
replace her.

355
00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:37.069
- Everyone knows that it
should've been Gracie's.

356
00:19:37.102 --> 00:19:38.103
- Gracie's great.

357
00:19:39.104 --> 00:19:41.573
But you and Annie? You're
on a different plane.

358
00:19:41.606 --> 00:19:43.308
- [Sam] Gracie was the
understudy-

359
00:19:43.341 --> 00:19:44.943
- She wasn't ready.

360
00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:46.945
Harlow knew. And you
were.

361
00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:48.780
- What does it matter
now?

362
00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:52.751
- Ben?

363
00:19:52.784 --> 00:19:56.588
Theatre. Come on. we're up in
five.

364
00:19:56.621 --> 00:19:57.456
- On my way.

365
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.430
- [Gracie] Five! Harlow is
waiting.

366
00:20:05.464 --> 00:20:09.568
- Look. Sam. sorry that I
never came back.

367
00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:11.136
- You were with The Aus
Ballet.

368
00:20:12.471 --> 00:20:13.271
Why would you?

369
00:20:13.304 --> 00:20:14.940
- Because I always admired
Annie.

370
00:20:17.609 --> 00:20:18.310
And you.

371
00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:21.913
(gentle piano music)

372
00:20:21.946 --> 00:20:23.282
- Ben! Hurry up!

373
00:20:25.984 --> 00:20:27.919
(door closes)
- Anyway...

374
00:20:27.952 --> 00:20:30.088
It's good to see you.
Sam.

375
00:20:30.121 --> 00:20:31.123
You look good.

376
00:20:31.156 --> 00:20:32.425
- You too.

377
00:20:32.458 --> 00:20:33.293
I mean...

378
00:20:37.095 --> 00:20:38.897
(Sam sighs)

379
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.299
Nice one. Sam.

380
00:20:40.332 --> 00:20:43.168

381
00:20:46.439 --> 00:20:49.808

(gentle orchestral music

386
00:21:54.807 --> 00:21:56.576
- All right. Thank you.
Marcus.

387
00:21:56.608 --> 00:21:57.910
That was lovely. Good. good.
good.

- You didn't tell me you were
so good.

429
00:24:14.147 --> 00:24:15.582
- Eve?

430
00:24:15.615 --> 00:24:16.949
How did you get in here?

431
00:24:16.983 --> 00:24:18.418
- Front door?

432
00:24:18.451 --> 00:24:20.254
Ugh. Sweaty hug.

433
00:24:20.287 --> 00:24:21.488
(Eve chuckles)
- Sorry.

434
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:26.560
- So. this is your community
service?

435
00:24:26.593 --> 00:24:30.931
It's not bad. And you're
dancing again?

436
00:24:30.964 --> 00:24:32.132
- No.
(Eve chuckles)

437
00:24:32.165 --> 00:24:35.169
No. that was nothing. Believe
me.

438
00:24:38.605 --> 00:24:40.407
I missed you.

439
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.075
- Me too.

440
00:24:42.108 --> 00:24:45.946
- But. uh. you really
shouldn't be in here.

441
00:24:45.979 --> 00:24:48.415
- You're kicking me out
already? I just got here.

442
00:24:48.448 --> 00:24:52.252
(gentle orchestral music)

443
00:24:52.285 --> 00:24:54.121
- You want to see
something?

444
00:24:54.154 --> 00:24:55.757
Shut your mouth and come with
me.

445
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:57.457
- [Eve] Okay. what are you
implying?

446
00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.627
- That you're incapable of
keeping quiet.

447
00:25:01.461 --> 00:25:05.799
(gentle orchestral music
continues)

448
00:25:08.101 --> 00:25:10.104
This is "The Red Shoes."

449
00:25:14.107 --> 00:25:17.779
(frenzied orchestral
music)

450
00:25:23.116 --> 00:25:24.686
It's called "The Dance of
Death."

451
00:25:25.619 --> 00:25:27.187
The shoes are bewitched.

452
00:25:28.955 --> 00:25:33.961
She's alone and cursed to
dance until the day she
dies.

453
00:25:35.295 --> 00:25:37.298
- Whoa. Depressing much?

454
00:25:38.164 --> 00:25:42.737
- The price she pays for
giving in to temptation.

455
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.440
(dramatic orchestral
music)

456
00:25:57.785 --> 00:26:01.456
(frenzied orchestral
music)

457
00:26:06.926 --> 00:26:08.630
- [Ms. Harlow] Right. Stop.
please!

458
00:26:09.597 --> 00:26:11.932
Gracie. What was that?

459
00:26:12.833 --> 00:26:15.770
- Sorry. Ms. Harlow. Just a
bit tired.

460
00:26:15.803 --> 00:26:17.739
- Well. so is Karen.

461
00:26:17.772 --> 00:26:20.140
The red shoes want to
dance. but she doesn't.

462
00:26:20.173 --> 00:26:21.908
But she does not have
choice.

463
00:26:21.941 --> 00:26:24.312
She can't just mark it
through.

464
00:26:24.345 --> 00:26:26.947
(gentle music)

465
00:26:28.849 --> 00:26:30.652
Everyone. on stage. please.
Quickly!

466
00:26:31.852 --> 00:26:33.321
- What's her problem?

467
00:26:33.354 --> 00:26:34.589
- [Sam] Shh.

468
00:26:34.622 --> 00:26:37.291
- This is perhaps the
most important lesson

469
00:26:37.324 --> 00:26:38.693
I will ever teach you.

470
00:26:39.794 --> 00:26:43.398
It is not enough to
merely dance the steps.

471
00:26:43.431 --> 00:26:47.568
You must feel them with
every fibre of your
being.

472
00:26:47.601 --> 00:26:50.271
That is the essence of
performance.

473
00:26:51.138 --> 00:26:55.576
Now. Gracie. think of Karen's
journey.

474
00:26:55.609 --> 00:26:57.911
Her sadness. Her shame.

475
00:26:57.944 --> 00:27:00.081
I want you to really dig
deep.

476
00:27:00.114 --> 00:27:00.914
Make...

477
00:27:00.947 --> 00:27:02.750
Who is out there?!

478
00:27:02.783 --> 00:27:04.752
- Uh. it's just me. Ms.
Harlow.

479
00:27:04.785 --> 00:27:09.124
Um. I was headed backstage to
clean.

480
00:27:10.124 --> 00:27:12.226
- Right. Off you go.
then.

481
00:27:12.259 --> 00:27:13.261
Quietly.

482
00:27:17.598 --> 00:27:20.768
So. Gracie. are you still
tired?

483
00:27:20.801 --> 00:27:21.769
- No. Ms. Harlow.

484
00:27:21.802 --> 00:27:23.638
- Good. We'll leave the
solo there for today.

485
00:27:23.671 --> 00:27:24.605
Let's go to the pas de deux.
please.

486
00:27:24.638 --> 00:27:26.741
Pas de deux. please.
Marcus!

487
00:27:26.774 --> 00:27:27.608
(footsteps pattering)

488
00:27:27.641 --> 00:27:28.777
Places. please.

489
00:27:34.348 --> 00:27:36.417
Thank you!

490
00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.954
(gentle orchestral music)

491
00:27:50.097 --> 00:27:51.733
(footsteps pattering)

492
00:27:51.766 --> 00:27:53.902
Feet. feet. feet. feet. feet.
feet. feet!

493
00:27:53.935 --> 00:27:55.103
Sloppy. girls!

494
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:01.810
(gentle orchestral music
continues)

495
00:28:01.843 --> 00:28:05.113
(Ms. Harlow mumbling)

496
00:28:16.858 --> 00:28:18.560
- Oh!
- Ow!

497
00:28:18.593 --> 00:28:19.561
Ow.
- I'm so sorry.

498
00:28:19.594 --> 00:28:20.427
- Stop. please!
- Dammit. Ben!

499
00:28:20.461 --> 00:28:22.130
- [Ms. Harlow] Clear the
stage. girls.

500
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:25.266
- [Hannah] Oh. no.

501
00:28:26.968 --> 00:28:28.770
- It's fine. I just need
ice.

502
00:28:28.803 --> 00:28:29.638
Ow!

503
00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:32.842
- I don't think so.

504
00:28:35.276 --> 00:28:36.645
- Let me see.

505
00:28:36.678 --> 00:28:38.145
- I think we need to
take her to a hospital.

506
00:28:38.178 --> 00:28:39.147
- It's fine!

507
00:28:40.114 --> 00:28:41.249
No thanks to you.

508
00:28:41.282 --> 00:28:43.619
- No. it's better to be safe.
Gracie.

509
00:28:43.652 --> 00:28:46.455
All right. thank you.
Hannah.
Let me know what they
say.

510
00:28:47.288 --> 00:28:49.825
No. not you. Ben. I
need you for rehearsal.

511
00:28:49.858 --> 00:28:50.693
- I can help.

512
00:28:52.092 --> 00:28:53.094
- Don't.
- Okay.

513
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:56.465
- David?

514
00:28:59.935 --> 00:29:02.604
- All right. Paige. where are
you?

515
00:29:02.637 --> 00:29:04.406
Right. You're the
understudy.

516
00:29:04.439 --> 00:29:05.941
Do you know the steps?

517
00:29:05.974 --> 00:29:08.176
- Uh. no.

518
00:29:09.109 --> 00:29:10.412
- Well. a bit.

519
00:29:10.445 --> 00:29:12.281
- [Ms. Harlow] Well. which
one is it?

520
00:29:12.314 --> 00:29:14.416
Are you familiar with the pas
de deux?

521
00:29:14.449 --> 00:29:15.417
- Um...

522
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.084
- Have you learnt it?!

523
00:29:17.117 --> 00:29:19.086
- Not perfected. Like. I know
the steps.

524
00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:20.322
It's just remembering them
is-

525
00:29:20.355 --> 00:29:21.790
- She has trouble with
that.

526
00:29:24.459 --> 00:29:27.229
- We have been running this
for weeks.

527
00:29:27.262 --> 00:29:29.565
What are you doing in my
classes?

528
00:29:29.598 --> 00:29:32.134
- I can take her through
the steps. Ms. Harlow.

529
00:29:32.167 --> 00:29:34.102
if they're the same as last
year.

530
00:29:36.471 --> 00:29:39.108
- You should know this.
You are the understudy.

531
00:29:40.342 --> 00:29:43.779
But. Samantha. if you are
so
confident. front and
centre.

532
00:29:43.812 --> 00:29:45.414
- No. no. I...

533
00:29:45.447 --> 00:29:47.850
- Either you know it. or you
don't.

534
00:29:48.984 --> 00:29:49.818
- Please.

535
00:29:49.851 --> 00:29:51.587
- Look. just mark it
through.

536
00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.754
All right? For now?

537
00:29:52.787 --> 00:29:54.089
- Wait-
- Please. please. please.

538
00:29:54.122 --> 00:29:56.425
I think you'll be
brilliant.
I can't handle it.

539
00:29:56.458 --> 00:29:57.893
- Fine. Fine.

540
00:29:57.926 --> 00:29:59.428
- Hey. You'll be fine.

541
00:29:59.461 --> 00:30:00.596
- Just a mark.

542
00:30:04.666 --> 00:30:05.801
- [Ms. Harlow] Thank you!

543
00:30:05.834 --> 00:30:09.338
(gentle orchestral music)

544
00:30:21.182 --> 00:30:24.353
(footsteps pattering)

545
00:30:25.787 --> 00:30:30.125
(gentle orchestral music
continues)

546
00:30:45.473 --> 00:30:49.813
(gentle orchestral music
continues)

547
00:31:03.626 --> 00:31:07.964
(gentle orchestral music
continues)

548
00:31:11.266 --> 00:31:13.402
- [Eve] Woo-hoo! You go.
girl!

549
00:31:13.435 --> 00:31:15.071
- Who is out there?!

550
00:31:15.104 --> 00:31:15.839
- Oops.

551
00:31:19.809 --> 00:31:23.245
- [Ms. Harlow] Right.
Well.
that was not without
merit.

552
00:31:23.278 --> 00:31:25.815
Be here at seven o'clock in
the
morning with bags and
shoes.

553
00:31:25.848 --> 00:31:26.683
- [Sam] Bags?

554
00:31:28.051 --> 00:31:30.620
- [Ms. Harlow] You dance.
you
live-in. You know the
rules.

555
00:31:35.124 --> 00:31:37.627
(gentle music)

556
00:31:40.596 --> 00:31:42.098
- [Ben] Hey. That's my
spot.

557
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.969
- Annie stole it first.

558
00:31:47.169 --> 00:31:49.271
And now it's mine.

559
00:31:54.477 --> 00:31:55.311
- You okay?

560
00:31:58.114 --> 00:32:02.118
- Harlow wants her star
back. But I'm not her.

561
00:32:03.119 --> 00:32:03.853
I can't.

562
00:32:05.121 --> 00:32:06.623
Nobody can be her.

563
00:32:07.957 --> 00:32:09.292
- Then don't be.

564
00:32:10.459 --> 00:32:11.294
Just be Sam.

565
00:32:12.928 --> 00:32:15.064
(gentle music continues)

566
00:32:15.097 --> 00:32:16.833
She's pretty great when she
wants to be.

567
00:32:19.835 --> 00:32:21.237
- But you saw what happened
in there. Ben.

568
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:24.741
You practically had to
drag me across the stage.

569
00:32:24.774 --> 00:32:26.943
I don't even know if I can
still dance.

570
00:32:27.843 --> 00:32:29.279
- Well. do you even want
to?

571
00:32:31.114 --> 00:32:32.282
- I don't know anymore.

572
00:32:35.351 --> 00:32:36.453
- One step at a time.

573
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.622
First. can you still
dance?

574
00:32:42.125 --> 00:32:43.793
You already know the answer
to that.

575
00:32:46.929 --> 00:32:47.831
- And then?

576
00:32:50.599 --> 00:32:53.436
- Then you have to decide
if
this is really what you
want.

577
00:33:06.615 --> 00:33:08.953
(Sam sighs)

578
00:33:20.931 --> 00:33:22.065
(handle creaks)

579
00:33:22.098 --> 00:33:26.971
(door opens)
(door creaks)

580
00:33:30.273 --> 00:33:32.843
(gentle music)

581
00:33:52.762 --> 00:33:55.099
(Sam sighs)

582
00:33:56.266 --> 00:33:59.637
(gentle music continues)

583
00:34:02.438 --> 00:34:05.075
(light switch clicks)

584
00:34:05.108 --> 00:34:07.578
- [Sam] I want you to be here
with me.

585
00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:10.781
how we planned. how it
was always supposed to
be.

586
00:34:10.814 --> 00:34:12.583
- I'm not gonna be too far
away. Sam.

587
00:34:12.616 --> 00:34:13.917
- You're gonna be in New
York.

588
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:15.919
- [Annie] And just don't let
Eve get you

589
00:34:15.952 --> 00:34:17.788
into too much trouble while
I'm gone.

590
00:34:18.822 --> 00:34:22.259
(gentle music continues)

591
00:34:22.292 --> 00:34:24.995
- You know. Harlow wants
me to fill in for you

592
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:28.098
as Karen in "The Red
Shoes."

593
00:34:28.832 --> 00:34:31.635
- You don't need my
permission to dance.
Sammy.

594
00:34:31.668 --> 00:34:34.905
- I don't know. I think maybe
I do.

595
00:34:34.938 --> 00:34:36.674
- Of course you don't.

596
00:34:37.607 --> 00:34:38.609
You never did.

597
00:34:39.442 --> 00:34:40.277
- [Sam] I just...

598
00:34:41.444 --> 00:34:42.779
How am I gonna do this
without you?

599
00:34:42.812 --> 00:34:46.416
- Because you're you. And
this is your dream too.

600
00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:48.418
This is your opportunity.

601
00:34:48.451 --> 00:34:49.486
- Harlow hates me.

602
00:34:50.954 --> 00:34:52.589
She only puts up with me
because of you.

603
00:34:52.622 --> 00:34:54.825
- You're a star without
me. and you know it.

604
00:34:56.693 --> 00:34:57.628
Here.

605
00:34:58.428 --> 00:34:59.264
They should fit.

606
00:35:01.097 --> 00:35:02.300
- Won't you need these?

607
00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:04.768
- They'll give me more when I
get there.

608
00:35:04.801 --> 00:35:07.804
Plus. it's something
you can remember me by.

609
00:35:07.837 --> 00:35:10.908
(gentle music continues)

610
00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:13.777
- It was meant to be you
and me going together.

611
00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.647
It was always meant to be us
together.

612
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.749
and now you're leaving and
you're-

613
00:35:18.782 --> 00:35:19.583
- [Annie] Hey.

614
00:35:19.616 --> 00:35:20.918
- You're...

615
00:35:20.951 --> 00:35:21.818
(Sam sighs)

616
00:35:21.851 --> 00:35:22.686
- Hey.

617
00:35:25.323 --> 00:35:26.457
- I'm gonna miss you.

618
00:35:28.491 --> 00:35:30.128
- Trust yourself. Sam.

619
00:35:31.594 --> 00:35:32.930
This role was meant for
you.

620
00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:37.135
(gentle music continues)

621
00:35:37.168 --> 00:35:40.604
And. hey. this is your moment
to be seen.

622
00:35:45.608 --> 00:35:48.980
And you're gonna be
there with me next year.

623
00:35:52.649 --> 00:35:54.085
- Okay.

624
00:35:54.118 --> 00:35:57.422
(gentle music continues)

625
00:35:57.454 --> 00:35:58.290
- Perfect.

626
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.960
Can I finish packing?

627
00:36:02.826 --> 00:36:03.660
(hands slapping)

628
00:36:03.693 --> 00:36:04.561
(Sam laughs)

629
00:36:04.594 --> 00:36:07.598
Thank you.
(both laughing)

00:36:11.268 --> 00:36:14.672

00:40:37.603 --> 00:40:38.438
Thank you.

674
00:40:43.609 --> 00:40:44.644
All right.
(Ms. Harlow clapping)

675
00:40:44.677 --> 00:40:45.612
Thank you.

676
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.081
Now. with Gracie injured.

677
00:40:49.114 --> 00:40:51.584
I need to ensure we
can open without issue.

678
00:40:51.617 --> 00:40:54.086
So. Paige. I'd like you
to
see me after class.
please.

679
00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:55.087
And we'll go through-

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.490

00:40:59.659 --> 00:41:02.161
(door closes)

682
00:41:02.194 --> 00:41:03.762
Samantha. you're late.

683
00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:04.630
- I had to pack.

684
00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:08.134
- Paige. Barre then
choreology charts.

685
00:41:08.167 --> 00:41:10.236
We still need an
understudy.

686
00:41:10.269 --> 00:41:12.305
All right. Thank you.
Marcus.

687
00:41:12.338 --> 00:41:14.574
Warm up.
- Where are those charts?

688
00:41:14.607 --> 00:41:16.442
- [Andrea] I don't know.
Under your bed?

689
00:41:16.475 --> 00:41:17.577
- [Ms. Harlow] And...

690
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:19.945
(gentle piano music)

691
00:41:19.978 --> 00:41:20.813

692
00:41:23.282 --> 00:41:24.117
Reaching one.

693
00:41:25.117 --> 00:41:26.119
Long spine.

695
00:41:30.822 --> 00:41:31.658

696
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:33.626
A one. plié and there

697
00:41:33.659 --> 00:41:35.161
A one. and two.

698
00:41:35.194 --> 00:41:36.828
And one plié and there.

699
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:38.598
Posé. And two.

700
00:41:38.631 --> 00:41:41.100
And high on the relevé and
up.

701
00:41:41.133 --> 00:41:41.934
And there.

702
00:41:41.967 --> 00:41:44.237
And high on the relevé.
Hold.

703
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.106
Slide it. Gather.

704
00:41:47.106 --> 00:41:48.574
That's it. Lengthen.
lengthen.

705
00:41:48.607 --> 00:41:49.476
Back of the neck.

706
00:41:50.609 --> 00:41:51.411
All right.

707
00:41:51.444 --> 00:41:54.614
(gentle piano music)

708
00:41:59.618 --> 00:42:00.453
Right. stop. Thank you.

709
00:42:00.486 --> 00:42:01.988
Thank you. Marcus.

710
00:42:04.457 --> 00:42:06.092
(Sam sighs)

711
00:42:06.125 --> 00:42:07.294
What was that?

712
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:10.664
- Dancing?

713
00:42:12.932 --> 00:42:13.768
- "Dancing"?

714
00:42:14.934 --> 00:42:16.569
Well. you may have been
doing the steps. my dear.

715
00:42:16.602 --> 00:42:18.171
but that was not dancing.

716
00:42:19.839 --> 00:42:23.076
Only the most dedicated
dancers
get into this programme.

717
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:24.944
Let alone for a second
time.

718
00:42:26.646 --> 00:42:27.815
So. dance.

719
00:42:28.981 --> 00:42:30.651
From the lift. please. Thank
you.

720
00:42:35.321 --> 00:42:38.458
(gentle piano music)

721
00:42:41.327 --> 00:42:42.162
Stop!

722
00:42:45.464 --> 00:42:46.734
I think I'm going to have to
have a word

723
00:42:46.767 --> 00:42:48.134
with my junior teachers.

724
00:42:49.301 --> 00:42:51.605
And the Australian
Company. for that matter.

725
00:42:52.773 --> 00:42:55.408
If the two of you are
incapable
of performing a simple
lift.

726
00:42:55.441 --> 00:42:57.344
we have clearly all failed at
our jobs.

727
00:43:01.481 --> 00:43:03.851
Now. can I see it again.
please? Properly this
time.

728
00:43:05.452 --> 00:43:08.622
(gentle piano music)

729
00:43:22.935 --> 00:43:25.606
(doors opening)

730
00:43:41.621 --> 00:43:42.922
- You'll find nothing's
changed.

731
00:43:42.955 --> 00:43:44.625
- [Sam] Yeah. I can see
that.

732
00:43:45.692 --> 00:43:47.428
- [Hannah] No food in
the rooms. as you know.

733
00:43:47.461 --> 00:43:51.398
- [Sam] Mm-hmm.

734
00:43:51.431 --> 00:43:52.733
- Music to be played
through

735
00:43:52.766 --> 00:43:54.568
headphones only. after
nine.
- Headphones only. after
nine.

736
00:43:54.601 --> 00:43:55.436
Yeah.

737
00:43:57.937 --> 00:43:58.772
Same old. same old.

738
00:43:58.805 --> 00:44:00.407
- Hey Sam.
- Oh. Hey. guys.

739
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.976
(Sam chuckles)

740
00:44:07.447 --> 00:44:09.617
No. No. not this one.

741
00:44:10.851 --> 00:44:11.752
- We thought it'd be nice for
you

742
00:44:11.785 --> 00:44:13.120
to have something
familiar.

743
00:44:16.122 --> 00:44:16.955
Here we are.

744
00:44:18.625 --> 00:44:21.128
- All you need is a little
inspiration.

745
00:44:21.161 --> 00:44:24.698
And I think that's it.

746
00:44:26.166 --> 00:44:27.268
Sammy.

747
00:44:29.769 --> 00:44:31.238
Hi.
- What?

748
00:44:31.271 --> 00:44:32.106
- Voila.

749
00:44:35.842 --> 00:44:38.913
- [Hannah] Are you all right.
dear?

750
00:44:38.946 --> 00:44:40.447
- Sorry.

751
00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.348
Sorry. I'm...

752
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:43.184
Yeah. I'm fine.

753
00:44:44.618 --> 00:44:47.254
- Ms. Harlow kept this room
empty.

754
00:44:47.287 --> 00:44:49.858
I think. somehow. she knew
you'd be back.

755
00:44:51.358 --> 00:44:54.462
Well. okay. Another big day
tomorrow.

756
00:44:55.662 --> 00:44:56.630
Get some rest.

757
00:45:07.674 --> 00:45:10.679
(suitcase rumbling)

758
00:45:38.305 --> 00:45:39.908
Hey.

759
00:45:39.941 --> 00:45:41.643
- [Eve] Yes. I so needed
this.

760
00:45:41.676 --> 00:45:43.611
- [Sam] How do you like
it?

761
00:45:43.644 --> 00:45:45.078
- Can barely tell it's
vegan.

762
00:45:45.111 --> 00:45:47.080
- [Sam] Right?

763
00:45:47.113 --> 00:45:48.349
- So. what's up?

764
00:45:49.316 --> 00:45:50.452
You all good?

765
00:45:51.284 --> 00:45:56.290
- I just-
(ship horn blares)

766
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:59.293
I-
(engine rumbling)

767
00:45:59.326 --> 00:46:00.160
- What?

768
00:46:01.127 --> 00:46:01.963
- I...

769
00:46:02.964 --> 00:46:04.799
Screw this. Follow me.

770
00:46:08.134 --> 00:46:08.970
Come on.

771
00:46:11.772 --> 00:46:14.342
(dogs barking)

772
00:46:25.118 --> 00:46:28.122
- Not bad. Definitely
quieter.

773
00:46:32.125 --> 00:46:34.796
- It's the only place
here I can get any peace.

774
00:46:34.829 --> 00:46:37.065
- Mm. Deep.

775
00:46:37.097 --> 00:46:38.266
- You're such a butt.

776
00:46:38.299 --> 00:46:39.567
- Your face is a butt.

777
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.568
(soda splashes)

778
00:46:40.601 --> 00:46:43.438
Hey!
(Sam laughs)

779
00:46:43.471 --> 00:46:44.806
(Eve chuckles)

780
00:46:44.839 --> 00:46:48.076
How did I end up with
such
a classy friend like you?

781
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:50.144
- Just lucky. I guess.

782
00:46:50.177 --> 00:46:53.082
It's weird though. not
being
there with you at school.

783
00:46:53.114 --> 00:46:55.149
- Yeah. Like you noticed.

784
00:46:55.182 --> 00:46:57.118
- I seriously miss our
crew.

785
00:46:58.185 --> 00:46:59.120
Even Freddy.

786
00:47:00.287 --> 00:47:02.924
- And that is enough sugar
for you.

787
00:47:02.957 --> 00:47:05.760
(both chuckling)

788
00:47:05.793 --> 00:47:07.128
No. Freddy's all right.

789
00:47:08.195 --> 00:47:09.664
He gets me.

790
00:47:09.697 --> 00:47:11.066
- What. and I don't?

791
00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:12.567
- You? Nah.

792
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.235
(Eve chuckles)

793
00:47:14.268 --> 00:47:17.238
(gentle music)

794
00:47:17.271 --> 00:47:19.274
You have parents.

795
00:47:20.108 --> 00:47:22.577
I have a dad who's always at
work

796
00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:26.115
or off shooting animals
with his weird friends.

797
00:47:26.147 --> 00:47:29.250
And. somehow. there's never
a
dead deer in the
refrigerator.

798
00:47:29.283 --> 00:47:31.285
which. actually. doesn't work
right now

799
00:47:31.318 --> 00:47:33.421
'cause. apparently. you have
to pay

800
00:47:33.454 --> 00:47:35.590
for electricity and rent.

801
00:47:35.623 --> 00:47:37.291
Every month.

802
00:47:37.324 --> 00:47:38.627
- Why didn't you tell me?

803
00:47:39.694 --> 00:47:41.930
- You're not exactly around
much.

804
00:47:41.963 --> 00:47:44.565
- You could've come and
stayed with me.

805
00:47:44.598 --> 00:47:47.103
- Yeah. I bet your mom would
love that.

806
00:47:47.969 --> 00:47:52.607
Sam. I don't blame you. I
mean. look at this life.

807
00:47:53.775 --> 00:47:56.577
- This was her idea. I didn't
want this.

808
00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:57.679
- Then you're an idiot.

809
00:47:58.612 --> 00:48:02.583
Sam. this whole
opportunity.
you're so lucky.

810
00:48:02.616 --> 00:48:04.854
- Everywhere I look. I see
Annie.

811
00:48:06.287 --> 00:48:07.857
Everything reminds me of
her.

812
00:48:09.624 --> 00:48:12.360
- We can't stop living
just
because we've lost
something.

813
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:15.664
- How am I supposed to fill
her shoes

814
00:48:15.697 --> 00:48:18.968
when this was everything to
her?

815
00:48:19.935 --> 00:48:22.738
- You gotta stop blaming
yourself.

816
00:48:22.771 --> 00:48:25.675
You're dancing now because
this
is what you're meant to
do.

817
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:28.110
Even I saw that.

818
00:48:30.979 --> 00:48:31.814
More sugar?

819
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.917
- No.

820
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:35.951
I'll be up all night.

821
00:48:36.952 --> 00:48:38.821
- Want some of this
sugar?

822
00:48:40.455 --> 00:48:43.826
(gentle music continues)

823
00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:46.294
- I missed you.

824
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:49.832
- Hey. don't go all sooky on
me.

825
00:48:49.865 --> 00:48:52.468
(Sam chuckles)

826
00:48:54.603 --> 00:48:55.438
I miss you too.

827
00:48:59.273 --> 00:49:02.678
(gentle music continues)

828
00:49:08.784 --> 00:49:11.120
(Sam sighs)

829
00:49:14.623 --> 00:49:17.126
(Sam sighing)

830
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:22.664
(Sam gasps)

831
00:49:22.697 --> 00:49:24.433
- [Sam] Oh. no.

832
00:49:24.466 --> 00:49:25.567
- Lift it. girls.
(door opens)

833
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.569
Lift the thighs.

834
00:49:27.602 --> 00:49:28.803
(door closes)

835
00:49:28.837 --> 00:49:31.073
Samantha. nice of you to
fit
us into you busy
schedule.

836
00:49:31.106 --> 00:49:32.441
- Sorry. Ms. Harlow.

837
00:49:33.608 --> 00:49:35.944
- And lift it.

838
00:49:35.977 --> 00:49:37.412
Hold it.

839
00:49:37.445 --> 00:49:38.314
Take your balance.

840
00:49:40.315 --> 00:49:44.254
And a five. and a six.
and a seven. and eight.

841
00:49:44.286 --> 00:49:45.921
Here we go.

842
00:49:45.954 --> 00:49:49.126
(footsteps pattering)

843
00:49:50.292 --> 00:49:52.594
(Sam groans)
Stop. please. Stop.

844
00:49:52.627 --> 00:49:55.597
(Sam sighs)

845
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:56.364
Again.

846
00:49:57.933 --> 00:50:00.236
Alive in the eyes. girls.
Ready?

847
00:50:00.269 --> 00:50:04.073
And five. and a six.
and a seven. and eight.

848
00:50:04.106 --> 00:50:05.774
Here we go.

849
00:50:05.807 --> 00:50:08.744
(footsteps pattering)

850
00:50:08.777 --> 00:50:09.678
Stop!

851
00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.649
First. you come in late.

852
00:50:13.682 --> 00:50:16.119
And now. you're putting
another dancer at risk.

853
00:50:18.955 --> 00:50:20.789
Is this a game to you?

854
00:50:20.822 --> 00:50:21.757
(Sam sighs)

855
00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:23.092
- She. she's just-

856
00:50:23.125 --> 00:50:23.960
- Quiet!

857
00:50:26.795 --> 00:50:28.999
I know what you're capable
of. Samantha.

858
00:50:30.099 --> 00:50:31.267
So. is it laziness.

859
00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:34.570
or are you deliberately
trying to sabotage my
ballet?

860
00:50:34.603 --> 00:50:35.437
Which is it?

861
00:50:37.606 --> 00:50:41.744
The only way to dance
this
is by putting in the
work.

862
00:50:41.777 --> 00:50:43.146
- I have been working.

863
00:50:43.179 --> 00:50:44.814
- Then show me.

864
00:50:44.847 --> 00:50:47.283
The death scene. The
batterie. please.

865
00:50:47.316 --> 00:50:48.617
Just Samantha.

866
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:49.618
(Sam sighs)

867
00:50:49.651 --> 00:50:50.486
Ready?

868
00:50:53.155 --> 00:50:58.161
And...

869
00:50:59.328 --> 00:51:01.363
No. See. it's weak and
sloppy.

870
00:51:02.865 --> 00:51:04.234
Can I see some fouetté.
please?

871
00:51:04.267 --> 00:51:05.235
- [Ben] Ms. Harlow...

872
00:51:05.268 --> 00:51:07.469
- Quiet! I am not speaking to
you.

873
00:51:10.973 --> 00:51:12.075
Whip. More whip.

874
00:51:12.108 --> 00:51:13.576
Second up

875
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:14.476
(Sam sighs)
Again.

876
00:51:15.945 --> 00:51:18.281
(Sam sighs)

877
00:51:19.148 --> 00:51:19.983
And...

878
00:51:21.483 --> 00:51:22.953
There. Left side.

879
00:51:23.786 --> 00:51:25.288
Length.
(Sam groans)

880
00:51:25.321 --> 00:51:26.156
Again!

881
00:51:27.823 --> 00:51:30.160
(Sam sighs)

882
00:51:31.193 --> 00:51:33.596
Second up

883
00:51:33.629 --> 00:51:35.098
Stop.

884
00:51:35.131 --> 00:51:37.600
- I can't. I need to see
the...

885
00:51:37.633 --> 00:51:38.768
- Oh. you need to see?

886
00:51:39.635 --> 00:51:42.405
She needs to see. She
needs to see to dance.

887
00:51:42.438 --> 00:51:44.240
Move! Quickly.

888
00:51:44.273 --> 00:51:47.444
(footsteps pattering)

889
00:51:52.281 --> 00:51:53.116
Come on.

890
00:51:59.121 --> 00:52:00.089
More whip.

891
00:52:00.122 --> 00:52:02.959
(Sam groans)

892
00:52:02.992 --> 00:52:03.793
(Sam sighs)

893
00:52:03.826 --> 00:52:07.130
Dance is felt. not seen.

894
00:52:08.998 --> 00:52:13.637
If you want to know
what's
stopping you. it is right
there.

895
00:52:17.174 --> 00:52:20.311
From the second solo.
please. Quickly. girls.

896
00:52:20.344 --> 00:52:21.644
(footsteps pattering)

897
00:52:21.677 --> 00:52:22.612
Watch the canon.

898
00:52:24.613 --> 00:52:27.617
Show me the circle. Delicate
hands.

899
00:52:30.619 --> 00:52:31.454
And...

900
00:52:42.132 --> 00:52:43.933
Move. girls! Move!

901
00:52:43.966 --> 00:52:47.138
(footsteps pattering)

902
00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:53.610
All right. Enough.

903
00:52:56.612 --> 00:52:59.249
Why does Karen cross the
stage there

904
00:52:59.282 --> 00:53:02.353
and then raise her arms like
this?

905
00:53:04.854 --> 00:53:06.090
Anyone?

906
00:53:06.123 --> 00:53:08.125
- That's the
choreography?

907
00:53:08.158 --> 00:53:09.592
- The mouse in the
corner.

908
00:53:09.625 --> 00:53:10.962
"It's the choreography."

909
00:53:14.197 --> 00:53:15.132
Anyone?

910
00:53:16.333 --> 00:53:17.500
No? Samantha?

911
00:53:20.603 --> 00:53:24.241
Understanding why you're
doing what you're doing.

912
00:53:24.274 --> 00:53:26.576
not just what you're
doing.

913
00:53:26.609 --> 00:53:29.646
that's what separates
the good from the great.

914
00:53:31.181 --> 00:53:32.817
Annie Cavanaugh knew
that.

915
00:53:36.685 --> 00:53:37.620
Again.

916
00:53:39.489 --> 00:53:40.324
Again!

917
00:53:41.458 --> 00:53:42.293
Quickly. girls.

918
00:53:44.127 --> 00:53:44.962
Dawdling.

919
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:47.965
All right.

920
00:54:03.613 --> 00:54:04.915
All right. stop. please.
Stop.

921
00:54:04.948 --> 00:54:07.451
Girls. away. Quickly.

922
00:54:07.484 --> 00:54:08.786
By yourself. Come on.

923
00:54:08.819 --> 00:54:11.588
(Sam sighs)
(Sam clears throat)

924
00:54:11.621 --> 00:54:12.356
Again.

925
00:54:16.827 --> 00:54:17.661
No! Again!

926
00:54:19.129 --> 00:54:22.166
I want you to take all that
negativity.

927
00:54:22.199 --> 00:54:25.437
every tear you have
ever shed. and show me.

928
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:27.271
No. stop. Again.

929
00:54:28.138 --> 00:54:28.973
Again.

930
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.443
Stop hiding.

931
00:54:33.944 --> 00:54:35.413
Stop. Again.

932
00:54:35.446 --> 00:54:36.280
Again.

933
00:54:36.313 --> 00:54:38.582
Stop. Again.

934
00:54:38.615 --> 00:54:39.917
Nope. Again.

935
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:41.251
Stop. Again.

936
00:54:41.284 --> 00:54:42.586
- What do you want from
me?!

937
00:54:42.619 --> 00:54:45.490
- I want to see more than
just
feet moving down the
stage.

938
00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:50.961
Where's your pain. the
desperation. the loss?

939
00:54:52.463 --> 00:54:54.265
You. of all people. should
understand

940
00:54:54.298 --> 00:54:56.468
what it's like to lose
everything.

941
00:54:59.303 --> 00:55:00.737
Oh. this is familiar.

942
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:02.906
Running away. Avoiding the
difficult work.

943
00:55:02.939 --> 00:55:05.243
- I'm here! I have been
working!

944
00:55:05.276 --> 00:55:08.413
- Not enough! Your sister
would've bared her soul!

945
00:55:08.446 --> 00:55:10.948
- And now she's gone! I'm not
her!

946
00:55:10.981 --> 00:55:11.816
- Good!

947
00:55:13.617 --> 00:55:14.352
Good!

948
00:55:16.653 --> 00:55:18.622
Let me see me who you
are.

949
00:55:28.632 --> 00:55:30.968
(Sam sighs)

950
00:55:43.314 --> 00:55:44.415
- Eve was right. there is
something

951
00:55:44.448 --> 00:55:46.284
seriously wrong with her.

952
00:55:46.317 --> 00:55:50.088
- She's tough. But she's
gotten me to where I am.

953
00:55:50.121 --> 00:55:51.089
If it wasn't for her-

954
00:55:51.122 --> 00:55:52.357
- You're defending her?

955
00:55:53.191 --> 00:55:54.592
- [Ben] Gracie may not
recover in time.

956
00:55:54.625 --> 00:55:57.962
- Well. then she'll have
to
make do with Paige! Too
bad!

957
00:55:57.995 --> 00:55:59.998
- It's not just about Harlow.
Sam.

958
00:56:00.864 --> 00:56:03.101
It's about me. and everyone
on that stage.

959
00:56:03.134 --> 00:56:05.303
We're all relying on you.

960
00:56:05.336 --> 00:56:07.738
So. do what she said. Find
you.

961
00:56:07.771 --> 00:56:09.908
- What does that even
mean?

962
00:56:09.941 --> 00:56:13.278
- Look. Annie was one of
the
best I've ever partnered.

963
00:56:13.311 --> 00:56:16.948
not just because of her
feet.
or her line. but because

964
00:56:16.981 --> 00:56:20.619
she believed in herself.
- Well. I don't know if I
do!

965
00:56:21.452 --> 00:56:23.989
(gentle music)

966
00:56:25.656 --> 00:56:27.159
- Well. you'd better find
out.

967
00:56:29.327 --> 00:56:30.795
Otherwise. what's the
point?

968
00:56:41.105 --> 00:56:44.609
(gentle music continues)

969
00:56:45.977 --> 00:56:47.979
- These charts were written
by a spider.

970
00:56:49.347 --> 00:56:50.482
- A drunk spider.

971
00:56:51.949 --> 00:56:52.784
- Hey. Sam.

972
00:56:56.622 --> 00:56:59.124
Just wanted to see if you're
okay.

973
00:56:59.991 --> 00:57:00.825
- Yeah.

974
00:57:02.126 --> 00:57:03.596
I. um...

975
00:57:03.629 --> 00:57:07.131
- We came to your room
before. but you weren't
there.

976
00:57:07.164 --> 00:57:08.967
- Yeah. I'm fine. Thanks.

977
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.003
- You know. I've never
seen her like that
before.

978
00:57:13.337 --> 00:57:15.273
Do you need anything?

979
00:57:15.306 --> 00:57:16.141
- A voodoo doll?

980
00:57:17.942 --> 00:57:18.843
- I. um...

981
00:57:20.344 --> 00:57:21.681
- You're not okay.

982
00:57:23.147 --> 00:57:24.950
I know a crying sesh when I
see one.

983
00:57:26.817 --> 00:57:28.086
- You don't even have to
talk.

984
00:57:28.119 --> 00:57:29.821
- Yeah. Paige is good
enough with that on her
own.

985
00:57:29.854 --> 00:57:30.889
- Oh. thanks.

986
00:57:30.922 --> 00:57:33.626
Come on. Sam. How can you
say no to these faces?

987
00:57:34.792 --> 00:57:35.793
Mm.
- Please?

988
00:57:35.826 --> 00:57:37.262
- Come on.

989
00:57:37.295 --> 00:57:39.431
(gentle music)

990
00:57:39.464 --> 00:57:40.599
- Okay. Okay. fine.
(Andrea and Paige
squealing)

991
00:57:40.632 --> 00:57:42.434
(all chuckling)

992
00:57:42.467 --> 00:57:44.637
- Okay. firstly. what are we
wearing?

993
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:46.938
(Andrea laughs)

994
00:57:46.971 --> 00:57:48.307
- [Andrea] You know. blue's
your colour.

995
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:49.308
(Sam chuckles)

996
00:57:49.341 --> 00:57:50.576
- [Sam] So I can keep
the hat. you're saying.

997
00:57:50.609 --> 00:57:52.076
- [Andrea and Paige]
Uh...

998
00:57:52.109 --> 00:57:57.115
- Questionable.

- [Sam] Don't you ever
stop?

1095
01:04:48.361 --> 01:04:50.631
- Just needed to clear my
head.

1096
01:04:50.664 --> 01:04:51.699
- I know the feeling.

1097
01:04:56.603 --> 01:04:58.272
- The way you've been working
lately.

1098
01:04:59.606 --> 01:05:01.609
looks like you're finding
your feet again.

1099
01:05:02.609 --> 01:05:03.845
- One step at a time.

1100
01:05:08.448 --> 01:05:09.851
Why are you down here
though?

1101
01:05:11.185 --> 01:05:13.620
- [Ben] Just needed some
alone time.

1102
01:05:13.654 --> 01:05:15.123
- Sorry. do you want me to
go?

1103
01:05:15.156 --> 01:05:15.957
- No. No.

1104
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.825
No. it's fine.

1105
01:05:23.131 --> 01:05:25.600
When's the last time you
danced. Sam.

1106
01:05:25.633 --> 01:05:26.702
just because you could?

1107
01:05:28.136 --> 01:05:29.137
- What do you mean?

1108
01:05:30.437 --> 01:05:32.273
- Just put on some music and
danced?

1109
01:05:33.641 --> 01:05:35.143
- I. I don't know.

1110
01:05:38.278 --> 01:05:39.447
- [Ben] Shoes.

1111
01:05:48.122 --> 01:05:51.126
(gentle piano music)

1112
01:06:03.971 --> 01:06:07.943

01:06:50.618 --> 01:06:54.123

1116

(gentle piano music)

1121
01:08:11.967 --> 01:08:13.602
- Whoa.

1122
01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:16.739
Uh. sorry to interrupt your
rehearsal.

1123
01:08:16.772 --> 01:08:18.440
- Or whatever.

1124
01:08:20.474 --> 01:08:22.578
- There's a girl outside
asking for you. Sam.

1125
01:08:22.611 --> 01:08:24.146
She wouldn't come in.

1126
01:08:24.179 --> 01:08:26.414
- Yeah. seriously. I
think were dealing with

1127
01:08:26.447 --> 01:08:28.184
a real life vampire situation
here.

1128
01:08:31.286 --> 01:08:32.821
- Andrea.

1129
01:08:32.854 --> 01:08:33.689
Shut up.

1130
01:08:35.190 --> 01:08:38.460
- [Eve] Oh. there's my
best
friend finally giving a
crap!

1131
01:08:38.493 --> 01:08:39.595
- Eve?

1132
01:08:39.628 --> 01:08:40.763
What's happened? Are you
okay?

1133
01:08:40.796 --> 01:08:41.797
- Am I okay?

1134
01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:42.965
No! I'm not okay!

1135
01:08:42.998 --> 01:08:46.101
You ghost me?! Stop
answering
my calls. my texts?!

1136
01:08:46.134 --> 01:08:47.603
- We had burgers just the
other day-

1137
01:08:47.636 --> 01:08:49.104
- [Eve] Yeah. two weeks
ago!

1138
01:08:49.137 --> 01:08:51.140
- I'm sorry. I meant to call.
but-

1139
01:08:51.173 --> 01:08:52.274
- I needed you!

1140
01:08:52.307 --> 01:08:53.142
- Come on. Eve. we should
just-

1141
01:08:53.175 --> 01:08:55.577
- No. I had nowhere to go.
Sam!

1142
01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:56.578
- Eve.

1143
01:08:56.611 --> 01:08:58.814
- I'm sorry. You can come
inside.

1144
01:08:59.681 --> 01:09:01.917
- My dad got put in the
hospital with some liver
thing;

1145
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:03.953
we got kicked out of the
house!

1146
01:09:03.986 --> 01:09:06.922
- What? What's happened?

1147
01:09:06.955 --> 01:09:07.790
Freddy?

1148
01:09:09.124 --> 01:09:10.659
- My parents won't let girls
inside.

1149
01:09:10.692 --> 01:09:12.761
I've been sneaking her
in.

1150
01:09:12.794 --> 01:09:13.629
- Hey. come inside.

1151
01:09:13.662 --> 01:09:14.431
We can talk this through.
- No.

1152
01:09:14.463 --> 01:09:16.866
Do you know what? Freddy's
right.

1153
01:09:18.166 --> 01:09:19.302
I'll take my chances
alone.

1154
01:09:19.335 --> 01:09:20.169
I just...

1155
01:09:21.304 --> 01:09:24.740
I needed a friend. I thought
that was you.

1156
01:09:24.773 --> 01:09:26.608
- I'm here! You can come
inside!

1157
01:09:26.641 --> 01:09:28.844
- No. you're not here! You're
in there!

1158
01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:35.418
Just like everyone else.
Sam.
Never there when I need
you.

1159
01:09:35.451 --> 01:09:37.086
- Come on.
- Eve?

1160
01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.989
Eve!
- Just leave me alone.

1161
01:10:04.147 --> 01:10:06.483
(Sam sighs)

1162
01:10:18.961 --> 01:10:22.098
(teddy bear clatters)

1163
01:10:22.131 --> 01:10:23.133
- Thank you. Marcus.

1164
01:10:24.834 --> 01:10:28.271
Breathing. then rise.

1165
01:10:28.304 --> 01:10:33.076
Grands battement. balancé.
and. retiré

1166
01:10:33.109 --> 01:10:34.743
and there.

1167
01:10:34.777 --> 01:10:35.611
Good.

1168
01:10:36.712 --> 01:10:38.647
Benjamin. can you take
over for a moment.
please?

1169
01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.916
- Okay. Sure.

1170
01:10:39.949 --> 01:10:43.120
(gentle piano music)

1171
01:10:44.619 --> 01:10:45.654
Keep that heel forward.

1172
01:10:50.126 --> 01:10:51.660
- No. it's wonderful
news.

1173
01:10:53.963 --> 01:10:56.466
Absolutely. I'm delighted
too.

1174
01:10:58.633 --> 01:10:59.970
Yes. why not? Put her on.

1175
01:11:03.272 --> 01:11:04.141
Hello. you.

1176
01:11:06.275 --> 01:11:07.310
Back to it?

1177
01:11:08.444 --> 01:11:10.447
All right. I'll see you in
the morning.

1178
01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.314
Bells on.

1179
01:11:17.787 --> 01:11:21.291
(gentle orchestral music)

1180
01:11:26.462 --> 01:11:27.631
- She said wait in here.

1181
01:11:34.471 --> 01:11:38.809
(gentle orchestral music
continues)

1182
01:11:50.987 --> 01:11:55.326
(gentle orchestral music
continues)

1183
01:11:59.795 --> 01:12:01.131
- Enchanting. isn't it?

1184
01:12:06.503 --> 01:12:07.871
- I know this piece.

1185
01:12:11.941 --> 01:12:14.778
Annie. She used to dance
this.

1186
01:12:16.313 --> 01:12:17.981
- It's a simple story.
really.

1187
01:12:19.616 --> 01:12:20.351
Love.

1188
01:12:21.784 --> 01:12:26.690
Until you've deeply loved.
you
can't experience real
loss.

1189
01:12:29.825 --> 01:12:33.830
(gentle orchestral music
continues)

1190
01:12:33.863 --> 01:12:35.999
Why are you here.
Samantha?

1191
01:12:39.503 --> 01:12:40.338
- My mom. I...

1192
01:12:42.306 --> 01:12:47.178
I think she knew I still
wanted to dance.

1193
01:12:51.114 --> 01:12:51.948
Needed to.

1194
01:12:55.152 --> 01:12:57.821
- Well. it wasn't your
mother. It was me.

1195
01:13:02.192 --> 01:13:03.594
- Why?

1196
01:13:03.627 --> 01:13:06.664
Why would you want me back
after I...

1197
01:13:08.966 --> 01:13:13.170
- Last year was
difficult.
I know. but I believe-

1198
01:13:13.203 --> 01:13:16.240
- How could I come back
after...

1199
01:13:16.273 --> 01:13:17.641
How could I perform
again?

1200
01:13:17.675 --> 01:13:21.112
- Samantha. you have been
a
pupil at my school for how
long?

1201
01:13:23.614 --> 01:13:27.151
I like to think that we
teach
more than just ballet
here.

1202
01:13:30.487 --> 01:13:31.755
And I wasn't disappointed

1203
01:13:31.788 --> 01:13:33.324
that you didn't go on stage
that night.

1204
01:13:33.357 --> 01:13:34.492
I understood.

1205
01:13:36.994 --> 01:13:40.097
But I was hurt that you
didn't come back to us.

1206
01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:42.466
to yourself. your dream.

1207
01:13:43.634 --> 01:13:47.138
that you didn't trust
this
family to support you.

1208
01:13:50.607 --> 01:13:53.277
Losing Annie was difficult
for all of us.

1209
01:13:58.482 --> 01:13:59.584
I don't think I would've been
able

1210
01:13:59.617 --> 01:14:04.623
to process that either. by
myself.

1211
01:14:05.122 --> 01:14:07.659
(gentle music)

1212
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:17.969
- [Sam] That's you.

1213
01:14:20.203 --> 01:14:21.138
- Yes.

1214
01:14:23.807 --> 01:14:25.843
Shortly after I lost my
fiance.

1215
01:14:28.278 --> 01:14:31.282
It was the most difficult
thing
I have ever had to
endure.

1216
01:14:34.619 --> 01:14:36.821
But it was dancing that
guided me through.

1217
01:14:39.657 --> 01:14:42.092
It was the people around
me.

1218
01:14:42.125 --> 01:14:45.497
(gentle music continues)

1219
01:14:46.464 --> 01:14:49.468
What happened to Annie
was not your fault. Sam.

1220
01:14:53.338 --> 01:14:55.674
And deep down. I think you
know that.

1221
01:15:01.612 --> 01:15:03.315
But now. I hope you're ready
to be

1222
01:15:03.348 --> 01:15:04.616
a true member of this
cast

1223
01:15:04.649 --> 01:15:06.817
because you have a
difficult choice to make.

1224
01:15:08.619 --> 01:15:10.622
Gracie has been cleared to
dance.

1225
01:15:11.622 --> 01:15:12.457
- Oh.

1226
01:15:13.624 --> 01:15:15.427
- Now. she's a member of this
family too

1227
01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:18.163
and she has fought hard to
get back.

1228
01:15:19.996 --> 01:15:21.966
- I've worked hard too.

1229
01:15:23.301 --> 01:15:24.935
I-
- Yes. I know.

1230
01:15:24.968 --> 01:15:26.671
But families support each
other.

1231
01:15:26.704 --> 01:15:29.074
And Gracie needs our support
now too.

1232
01:15:29.107 --> 01:15:32.611
(gentle music continues)

1233
01:15:34.278 --> 01:15:36.114
I'd really like you to work
with Paige

1234
01:15:37.281 --> 01:15:40.118
so she can really be a
true understudy for
Gracie.

1235
01:15:42.286 --> 01:15:44.855
And you are so welcome in
the corps de ballet. Sam.

1236
01:15:45.956 --> 01:15:48.493
I think your presence
would
really lift everyone up.

1237
01:15:49.794 --> 01:15:50.962
It is up to you though.

1238
01:15:52.964 --> 01:15:55.801
Not your mother. And not
me.

1239
01:15:57.969 --> 01:15:58.804
You.

1240
01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:11.616

1282
01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:44.603
- [Sam] Hey.

1283
01:18:44.636 --> 01:18:45.371
- Hey. kiddo.

1284
01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:49.608
You okay?

1285
01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:52.845
- Yeah. I just wanted to see
you guys.

1286
01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:58.117
I know I've been terrible
recently.

1287
01:18:59.651 --> 01:19:01.187
I wanted to say sorry.

1288
01:19:03.622 --> 01:19:04.790
I spoke to Ms. Harlow.

1289
01:19:06.625 --> 01:19:08.093
Gracie's coming back.

1290
01:19:08.126 --> 01:19:08.929
- Oh. sweetheart.

1291
01:19:08.962 --> 01:19:09.796
- No. no. It's okay.

1292
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:13.466
Maybe next year will be my
year?

1293
01:19:16.836 --> 01:19:18.671
She offered me a place
in the corps though.

1294
01:19:18.704 --> 01:19:20.840
I don't know if you'd
want to come and watch

1295
01:19:20.873 --> 01:19:22.241
even if I'm just in the
back.

1296
01:19:22.274 --> 01:19:23.242
- Of course.

1297
01:19:23.275 --> 01:19:25.177
- [Bryan] We wouldn't
miss it for the world.

1298
01:19:27.446 --> 01:19:29.448
- I would love if Eve could
be there too.

1299
01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:32.585
- Are you sure that's a good
idea?

1300
01:19:32.618 --> 01:19:34.253
- We had a huge fight
recently.

1301
01:19:34.286 --> 01:19:36.923
I don't even know if she'd
show up.

1302
01:19:36.956 --> 01:19:37.958
- She'll come around.

1303
01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:40.827
- Yeah.

1304
01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:44.196
Well. I guess that's for her
to decide.

1305
01:19:45.364 --> 01:19:47.300
I just don't want to lose
anyone else.

1306
01:19:50.135 --> 01:19:51.638
- We love you. Sam.

1307
01:19:51.671 --> 01:19:54.340
- [Jennifer] Yeah. Come on.
sweetheart.

1308
01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:57.744
(Sam chuckles)

1309
01:19:57.777 --> 01:19:58.979
- Oh. Mom. Dad.

1310
01:20:01.279 --> 01:20:03.583
I have a favour to ask.

1319
01:21:43.616 --> 01:21:46.653
- The tempo around here
just
starts to get a little
bit...

1320
01:21:46.686 --> 01:21:49.190
(door closes)

1321
01:21:56.997 --> 01:21:58.598
- Hey.

1322
01:21:58.631 --> 01:22:01.601
Gracie. It's good to have you
back.

1323
01:22:01.634 --> 01:22:02.369
- [Gracie] Sure.

1324
01:22:05.139 --> 01:22:06.272
- Hey. can I take you through
the solo

1325
01:22:06.305 --> 01:22:07.307
after class. if you'd
like?

1326
01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:08.743
- Okay. Cool.

1327
01:22:08.776 --> 01:22:10.911
- All right. Enough
chatter.

1328
01:22:10.944 --> 01:22:11.779
Let's strip off and have

1329
01:22:11.812 --> 01:22:13.313
the plié. please.

1330
01:22:17.785 --> 01:22:18.652
First position.

1331
01:22:19.787 --> 01:22:20.788
Thank you. Marcus.

1332
01:22:21.922 --> 01:22:26.794
And five. and a six.
breathing. seven. and a
eight.

1333
01:22:27.628 --> 01:22:28.428
Plié

1334
01:22:28.461 --> 01:22:29.296
One.

1335
01:22:30.164 --> 01:22:31.431
Two.

1336
01:22:31.464 --> 01:22:32.299
Three.

1337

1339
01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.448
(Paige sighs)

1340
01:22:48.481 --> 01:22:50.251
- You're thinking too
much.

1341
01:22:50.283 --> 01:22:51.317
- I just...

1342
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:52.820
Every time...

1343
01:22:52.853 --> 01:22:54.588
- Listen. You've got
the pas de deux nailed.

1344
01:22:54.621 --> 01:22:55.589
So just-
- I know.

1345
01:22:55.622 --> 01:22:57.323
You've been great. Ben.

1346
01:22:57.356 --> 01:22:59.260
He cues me when I tie up.

1347
01:22:59.292 --> 01:23:00.761
- [Ben] But I can't
help you with the solo.

1348
01:23:00.794 --> 01:23:02.763
- We just need to keep
running it.

1349
01:23:02.796 --> 01:23:04.598
- Can you just run it one
more time?

1350
01:23:04.631 --> 01:23:05.867
It's starting to sink in.

1351
01:23:07.201 --> 01:23:09.470
- Mark it in your head.
I'll run through it.

1352
01:23:13.807 --> 01:23:15.643
(gentle music)

1353
01:23:15.676 --> 01:23:17.244
Sorry. I just...

1354
01:23:17.277 --> 01:23:18.779
Ben. can you run her
through
it a couple more times?

1355
01:23:18.812 --> 01:23:19.747
I have to go.

1356
01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:20.581
- [Ben] Sure.

1357
01:23:20.614 --> 01:23:21.749
- We'll pick it up
tomorrow?

1358
01:23:21.782 --> 01:23:22.750
- Yeah. Is everything
okay?

1359
01:23:22.783 --> 01:23:23.718
- Yeah. it's just...

1360
01:23:23.751 --> 01:23:25.686
The universe is calling.
we're all connected.

1361
01:23:27.988 --> 01:23:30.258
(door opens)

1362
01:23:30.291 --> 01:23:32.793
(gentle music continues)

1363
01:23:32.826 --> 01:23:34.094
- [Freddy] Hey.

1364
01:23:34.127 --> 01:23:35.930
- [Eve] You're late.

1365
01:23:35.963 --> 01:23:38.432
- [Freddy] So you started
without me. huh?

1366
01:23:38.465 --> 01:23:40.100
- If I waited for you. I'd
starve.

1367
01:23:40.133 --> 01:23:42.370
- Hardly. All you do is
eat.

1368
01:23:45.173 --> 01:23:50.179
Mm. Yum.

1369
01:23:50.477 --> 01:23:51.578
(Freddy sighs)

1370
01:23:51.612 --> 01:23:56.350
So. remember you said if
I told Sam where you
were.

1371
01:23:57.451 --> 01:23:58.320
you would kill me?

1372
01:23:59.786 --> 01:24:00.955
Well. it was her idea.

1373
01:24:02.123 --> 01:24:03.924
- You're so dead. Freddy!

1374
01:24:03.957 --> 01:24:05.093
- It wasn't his fault.

1375
01:24:05.126 --> 01:24:07.162
I told him he could take me
out sometime.

1376
01:24:07.195 --> 01:24:08.963
- I trusted you!
- Hey. Eve.

1377
01:24:08.996 --> 01:24:10.764
Eve. wait. Please!

1378
01:24:10.797 --> 01:24:12.267
- No. I trusted you too.

1379
01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:13.434
You and Freddy!
- I know.

1380
01:24:13.467 --> 01:24:16.137
- And the first chance
you got. you bailed on me

1381
01:24:16.170 --> 01:24:18.106
when I actually needed
you.
- I just...

1382
01:24:18.139 --> 01:24:20.308
I needed some time to work
some stuff out.

1383
01:24:20.341 --> 01:24:22.576
- We all do. Sam! That's the
point!

1384
01:24:22.609 --> 01:24:24.246
When you needed me. I was
there.

1385
01:24:24.279 --> 01:24:26.281
How many nights did we talk
about Annie?!

1386
01:24:29.951 --> 01:24:30.785
Sam. I-

1387
01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:32.854
- I know.

1388
01:24:34.122 --> 01:24:35.589
- No. I didn't mean-

1389
01:24:35.622 --> 01:24:36.457
- No. it's okay.

1390
01:24:38.458 --> 01:24:39.794
I know it's taken awhile.

1391
01:24:40.627 --> 01:24:43.464
but I finally feel.

1392
01:24:44.631 --> 01:24:46.168
I don't know. okay.

1393
01:24:47.802 --> 01:24:49.137
Eve. I'm so sorry.

1394
01:24:50.305 --> 01:24:52.374
I know I let you down. but
I'm here now.

1395
01:24:53.374 --> 01:24:55.978
(gentle music)

1396
01:24:57.111 --> 01:24:59.281
- Well. thanks to you. I'm
now addicted

1397
01:24:59.314 --> 01:25:01.783
to those vegan burgers.
so-
- No.

1398
01:25:01.816 --> 01:25:03.450
Not the hunter's
daughter.

1399
01:25:03.483 --> 01:25:05.921
(both chuckling)

1400
01:25:05.954 --> 01:25:06.788
I missed you.

1401
01:25:08.957 --> 01:25:11.092
- I know you have.

1402
01:25:11.125 --> 01:25:12.127
- [Sam] You butt.

1403
01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.095
- Your face is a butt.

1404
01:25:14.128 --> 01:25:17.265
(Eve chuckles)

1405
01:25:17.298 --> 01:25:18.133
- [Sam] Come on.

1406
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.469
(Eve laughs)

1407
01:25:22.469 --> 01:25:24.006
So. Freddy...

1408
01:25:25.306 --> 01:25:26.274
- [Freddy] Mm-hmm?

1409
01:25:26.307 --> 01:25:29.477
- How about I get you a
date with her instead?

1410
01:25:33.114 --> 01:25:33.949
- Hmm.

1411
01:25:34.949 --> 01:25:35.784
She paying?

1412
01:25:36.818 --> 01:25:38.920
(Sam chuckles)

1413
01:25:38.953 --> 01:25:40.956
- Come on. I have something
to show you.

1414
01:25:43.191 --> 01:25:46.461
(gentle music continues)

1415
01:25:46.494 --> 01:25:48.964
- Are you sure about
this?

1416
01:25:48.997 --> 01:25:51.166
- You need somewhere
proper to sleep. don't
you?

1417
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:57.139
- There's clothes in the
closet.

1418
01:25:58.506 --> 01:26:00.475
- Thanks. Mrs C.

1419
01:26:00.508 --> 01:26:03.912
- Sweats. Ts. A dress or two.
even.

1420
01:26:03.945 --> 01:26:06.614
I can wash those jeans
for you. if you like.

1421
01:26:06.647 --> 01:26:09.084
What's left of them.

1422
01:26:09.117 --> 01:26:13.088
(gentle music continues)

1423
01:26:13.121 --> 01:26:14.957
- How did you persuade
her?

1424
01:26:16.124 --> 01:26:18.994
- I just told her how much
you mean to me.

1425
01:26:22.297 --> 01:26:23.765
Stay as long as you like.

1426
01:26:23.798 --> 01:26:26.635
Just try not to annoy her too
much?

1427
01:26:29.837 --> 01:26:33.309
- Oh. wait. you're not
dumping
me here and going back
there?

1428
01:26:34.976 --> 01:26:36.379
Sam...

1429
01:26:38.813 --> 01:26:40.949
- I'll stay in touch this
time. I promise.

1430
01:26:42.284 --> 01:26:45.687
(gentle music continues)

1431
01:26:47.955 --> 01:26:49.992
- So you're dancing

1432
01:26:52.461 --> 01:26:53.296
- Yes.

1433
01:26:54.296 --> 01:26:55.198

All right. let's move on.

1464
01:28:57.119 --> 01:28:59.122
- [Jennifer] You sure
you don't want to come?

1465
01:28:59.955 --> 01:29:02.326
- I don't want to be
a distraction for Sam.

1466
01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:06.630
- She really cares about you.
Eve.

1467

And because of that.

always have a place here.
Okay?

1468
01:29:18.641 --> 01:29:20.810

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.782
- All right. dancers.

1474
01:29:59.815 --> 01:30:01.285
Just make sure your
skirt...

1475

So. feet. faces. feeling

1476

All right.

1477
01:30:10.126 --> 01:30:11.695
Toi toi toi. everyone.

1478
01:30:15.131 --> 01:30:17.667
Ah. Samantha. Thank you
for your work with Paige.

1479
01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.802
It's been very helpful.

1480
01:30:19.835 --> 01:30:21.938
- I learnt a lot as well.

1481
01:30:21.971 --> 01:30:25.142
- And your parents are in
tonight. so that's good.

1482
01:30:25.975 --> 01:30:30.146
- Yes. Won't be too
weird for them. I hope.

1483
01:30:30.179 --> 01:30:31.747
- And your friend?

1484
01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:32.615
- Maybe.

1485
01:30:34.117 --> 01:30:35.418
She's been going through a
lot lately.

1486
01:30:35.451 --> 01:30:37.187
Things have been hard for
her. so...

1487
01:30:39.856 --> 01:30:40.957
- And you?

1488
01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:44.594
(gentle piano music)

1489
01:30:44.627 --> 01:30:46.997
- I'm getting there. I
think.

1490
01:30:48.131 --> 01:30:49.933
- Well. just be yourself.
Samantha.

1491
01:30:49.966 --> 01:30:52.135
and everything will
slowly fall into place.

1492
01:30:55.638 --> 01:30:59.644
(gentle piano music
continues)

1493
01:31:00.476 --> 01:31:02.813
(Sam sighs)

1494
01:31:10.621 --> 01:31:12.624
- We'll give him another two
minutes.

1495
01:31:15.626 --> 01:31:16.960
(doors opening)

1496
01:31:16.993 --> 01:31:18.295
Ah. Freddy.

1497
01:31:19.796 --> 01:31:22.299
Mr. and Mrs. C. Freddy.

1498
01:31:23.833 --> 01:31:24.669
- Hi.

1499
01:31:26.002 --> 01:31:28.872
Wow. This is all a little
la-de-da.

1500
01:31:32.476 --> 01:31:34.110
- [Eve] Idiot.

1501
01:31:34.143 --> 01:31:35.979
- [Bryan] We'd better find
our seats.

1502
01:31:37.847 --> 01:31:39.650
- [Eve] Where were you?

1503
01:31:39.683 --> 01:31:41.251
- [Freddy] Relax.

1504
01:31:41.284 --> 01:31:43.153
- [Eve] Where were you?

1505
01:31:44.788 --> 01:31:46.356
- [Marion] Five minutes.
Gracie.

1506
01:31:52.161 --> 01:31:54.264
(door knocking)

1507
01:31:54.297 --> 01:31:55.500
- Toi toi toi.

1508
01:31:56.633 --> 01:31:58.135
- Not "break a leg"?

1509
01:31:59.001 --> 01:32:01.838
- Enjoy it. Gracie. You've
earned this.

1510
01:32:06.677 --> 01:32:10.180

(gentle orchestral music

1516
01:33:17.114 --> 01:33:18.349
- There she is.

1517
01:33:26.490 --> 01:33:30.829
(gentle orchestral music
continues)

1518
01:33:44.843 --> 01:33:48.346

(shoes clattering)

1522
01:34:08.867 --> 01:34:11.268
- [Ms. Harlow] Gracie? What's
going on?

1523
01:34:11.301 --> 01:34:13.304
- Where's Sam? Get Sam!

1524
01:34:13.337 --> 01:34:15.139
- Talk to me. What's going
on?

1525
01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:19.443
- I don't want to embarrass
us.

1526
01:34:19.477 --> 01:34:20.646
Just get Sam!

(gentle music)

1528
01:34:31.321 --> 01:34:32.657
- Gracie. I can't.

1529
01:34:32.690 --> 01:34:33.692
- Yes. you can.

1530
01:34:36.794 --> 01:34:38.329
Look.

1531
01:34:38.363 --> 01:34:42.099
(gentle music continues)

1532
01:34:42.132 --> 01:34:44.135
Think it's yours anyway.

1533
01:34:46.136 --> 01:34:47.473
- I think you'd better
hurry.

1534
01:35:04.121 --> 01:35:05.155
- What's happening?

1535
01:35:05.188 --> 01:35:07.192
- I don't know. Something
must be wrong.

1536
01:35:13.298 --> 01:35:15.267
- [Ms. Harlow] Sam? Why
aren't you ready?

1537
01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:16.635
- I just...

1538
01:35:16.668 --> 01:35:19.938
I shouldn't. I can't do
this.

1539
01:35:19.971 --> 01:35:21.273
- Sammy.
- No.

1540
01:35:21.306 --> 01:35:23.308
No. I'm not ready for
this. Paige. get Paige.

1541
01:35:23.341 --> 01:35:24.476
- [Ms. Harlow] Sam.

1542
01:35:24.509 --> 01:35:26.611
- I don't want it
anymore.
this responsibility.

1543
01:35:26.644 --> 01:35:28.146
This was never meant to be
me.

1544
01:35:28.179 --> 01:35:30.382
- Samantha. Just breathe.

1545
01:35:31.482 --> 01:35:34.085
(Sam exhales)

1546
01:35:34.118 --> 01:35:36.688

Shoe.

1548
01:35:39.791 --> 01:35:42.361
(gentle music)

1549
01:35:45.163 --> 01:35:48.099
Greatest performers.
artists.

1550
01:35:48.132 --> 01:35:51.136
they all share a deep
desire to tell a story.

1551
01:35:53.137 --> 01:35:57.843
And it will always be. in
some part. their own
story.

1552
01:35:59.877 --> 01:36:01.813
And the ability to convey
that.

1553
01:36:03.114 --> 01:36:08.120
to truly share their
deepest
fears and pain and love.

1554
01:36:09.955 --> 01:36:12.090
that's what makes them
great.

1555
01:36:12.123 --> 01:36:13.191
- That's not me.

1556
01:36:14.158 --> 01:36:16.628
- You have a story to tell.
Samantha.

1557
01:36:18.797 --> 01:36:20.867
You have suffered a great
loss.

1558
01:36:22.367 --> 01:36:24.804
but that is not the only
story you have to tell.

1559
01:36:25.804 --> 01:36:29.308
Happiness would mean
nothing without sadness.

1560
01:36:31.710 --> 01:36:34.446
Your vision will become
clear

1561
01:36:34.479 --> 01:36:37.415
only when you can look
into your own heart.

1562
01:36:37.448 --> 01:36:39.651
Who looks outside dreams.

1563
01:36:40.853 --> 01:36:42.922
who looks inside.

1564
01:36:42.955 --> 01:36:43.990
awakes.

1565
01:36:46.290 --> 01:36:47.660
- Jung?

1566
01:36:47.693 --> 01:36:49.963
- Mm-hmm. Annie's
favourite.

1567
01:36:51.295 --> 01:36:54.800
(gentle music continues)

1568
01:36:54.833 --> 01:36:57.302
It's time to tell your story.
Sam.

1569
01:36:58.469 --> 01:36:59.304
Show me.

1570
01:37:00.839 --> 01:37:01.674
Show me.

1571
01:37:03.842 --> 01:37:05.812
Now.. I think we need a
better dress.

1572
01:37:11.617 --> 01:37:12.619
- Here we go.

1573
01:37:16.121 --> 01:37:19.626

1574
01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:25.465

1575
01:37:26.665 --> 01:37:27.834

- Hey. oh. my god. It was so
good.

1597
01:44:36.965 --> 01:44:38.799
(audience continues
applauding)

1598
01:44:38.832 --> 01:44:41.836
(audience cheering)

1599
01:44:42.803 --> 01:44:45.474
(Bryan laughs)

1600
01:44:45.507 --> 01:44:49.812
(audience cheering and
applauding)

1601
01:45:01.622 --> 01:45:06.627
(audience continues
cheering and applauding)

1602
01:45:12.633 --> 01:45:15.170
(Bryan laughs)

1603
01:45:23.878 --> 01:45:26.215
(Sam sighs)

1604
01:45:34.623 --> 01:45:36.125
- Well done. Samantha.

1605
01:45:36.958 --> 01:45:38.494
Beautiful performance.

1606
01:45:42.297 --> 01:45:44.333
Benjamin said that your
parents are here.

1607
01:45:45.867 --> 01:45:47.135
- Would you mind asking
him

1608
01:45:47.168 --> 01:45:48.804
to show them through. Ms.
Harlow?

1609
01:45:51.139 --> 01:45:52.141
I just need a moment.

1610
01:46:01.450 --> 01:46:03.952
(bag rustles)

1611
01:46:14.128 --> 01:46:16.999
- Cool show. Great job.

1612
01:46:17.999 --> 01:46:21.504
So does all that
on-your-toe-stuff hurt your
feet?

1613
01:46:22.338 --> 01:46:23.606
- Only when I stand up.

1614
01:46:23.639 --> 01:46:24.474
- [Freddy] Ah.

1615
01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:26.808
- We're so grateful.

1616
01:46:26.841 --> 01:46:28.644
- You must be so proud.
- We are.

1617
01:46:28.677 --> 01:46:30.380
- Did Samantha say where she
was?

1618
01:47:12.621 --> 01:47:14.123
- She would be so proud.

1619
01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:19.861
I know I am.

1620
01:47:29.638 --> 01:47:31.274
(Sam sighs)

1621
01:47:31.307 --> 01:47:32.141
Come on.

1622
01:47:49.692 --> 01:47:50.826
- You were incredible.

1623
01:47:50.859 --> 01:47:52.428
- [Sam] Thanks.

1624
01:47:52.461 --> 01:47:54.597
I can't believe you guys made
it.

1625
01:47:54.630 --> 01:47:55.931
- You were amazing.

1626
01:47:55.964 --> 01:47:59.468
- Thanks.
- So proud of you. kiddo.

1627
01:47:59.501 --> 01:48:00.670
Can't believe it. You were
the lead.

1628
01:48:00.704 --> 01:48:02.438
- [Sam] Yeah. it was quite a
shock.

1629
01:48:02.471 --> 01:48:03.472
- What happened?

1630
01:48:03.505 --> 01:48:04.440
- Were you nervous?

1631
01:48:04.473 --> 01:48:06.142
- Yes. absolutely.
- Did you have fun?

1632
01:48:06.175 --> 01:48:07.310
- [Sam] Couldn't you
tell?

1633
01:48:07.343 --> 01:48:09.680
- Yeah-
- Hey. Mr. and Mrs. C.

1634
01:48:09.713 --> 01:48:11.347
can I speak to Sam?

1635
01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:12.181
- Yeah.
- Sure.

1636
01:48:12.214 --> 01:48:13.149
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1637
01:48:16.786 --> 01:48:18.154
- You were amazing.

1638
01:48:19.288 --> 01:48:20.123
Thank you...

1639
01:48:22.991 --> 01:48:25.294
- Sorry.
(Sam chuckles)

1640
01:48:25.327 --> 01:48:26.963
I've been wanting to do
that.

1641
01:48:30.499 --> 01:48:31.635
- Hey. Sam...

1642
01:48:33.469 --> 01:48:34.604
- Whoa.

1643
01:48:34.637 --> 01:48:36.972
I think we're gonna go
over-
- Over there.

1644
01:48:37.005 --> 01:48:37.840
- Yeah. Yep.

1645
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:54.591
(hand slaps)
(Freddy groans)

1646
01:48:54.624 --> 01:48:57.461
- Freddy! In your dreams!

1647
01:48:57.494 --> 01:48:59.095
- [Freddy] The universe told
me to do it.

1648
01:48:59.128 --> 01:49:00.262
Far out.

1649
01:49:00.295 --> 01:49:03.099
(Eve chuckles)

1650
01:49:03.132 --> 01:49:04.434
- [Eve] Come on!

1651
01:49:04.467 --> 01:49:07.203
(both chuckling)
