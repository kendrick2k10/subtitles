3
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.043
Compared with the research on dogs.

4
00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:56.507
the research on cats
is approximately 15 years behind.

5
00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:54.959
First of all.
you need to become friends with the kitty.

6
00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:01.966
It's important that the cat
trusts you completely.

7
00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:04.552
The cat shouldn't expect
any surprises from you.

8
00:26:29.629 --> 00:26:33.883
Cats are sensitive animals.

9
00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:36.469
People who do not like cats often say

10
00:26:36.553 --> 00:26:41.391
that they don't understand
what cats are thinking.

11
00:26:54.696 --> 00:26:57.866
If you look at
a cat. at their eyes. their ears.

12
00:26:57.949 --> 00:27:01.494
the way they are wagging their tails.
if you observe them.

13
00:27:01.578 --> 00:27:03.580
you can start understanding
how a cat feels.

14
00:27:35.278 --> 00:27:37.614
Movements of the tail
have various meanings.

15
00:27:37.697 --> 00:27:43.411
When a dog is wagging his tail.
people say that it is happy.

16
00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:44.996
That's not the case for a cat.

17
00:27:54.464 --> 00:27:57.967
When I come home.
and a cat is coming towards me.

18
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:03.515
holding its tail straight up.
it is in a good mood.

19
00:28:03.598 --> 00:28:08.144
It's saying. "Welcome home.
Where have you been? I missed you."

20
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:30.792
When its tail is fluffed up.
that is true fear!

21
00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:48.601
A cat has
20 different sounds

22
00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:50.395
to express its emotions.

23
00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:27.223
Cats that live with humans meow a lot.

24
00:29:28.224 --> 00:29:30.685
When a cat meows loudly and clearly once.

25
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:33.730
it often means
that the cat is demanding something.

26
00:29:33.813 --> 00:29:36.441
"I'm hungry. but there's no food
in my bowl."

27
00:29:36.524 --> 00:29:39.736
"I want water."
or. "Please open this door."

28
00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:48.453
When a cat
makes sounds with its throat.

29
00:29:48.536 --> 00:29:49.662
it's feeling really great…

30
00:29:51.247 --> 00:29:54.667
…a little bit enchanted or mesmerized.

31
00:29:54.751 --> 00:29:57.420
That is the sound it makes.

32
00:33:35.346 --> 00:33:38.683
Not every cat can do special tricks.

33
00:33:38.766 --> 00:33:43.312
You must observe the cat
to understand what she is capable of

34
00:33:43.396 --> 00:33:46.274
and teach them things
based on their strengths.

35
00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:35.114
It's like
with humans. Some are great at computers.

36
00:34:35.198 --> 00:34:38.201
Some can be great ballerinas.

37
00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:41.996
You wouldn't teach computers
to a ballerina.

38
00:55:17.939 --> 00:55:21.234
Dogs see
their owners as gods.

39
00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:24.487
But cats think of <i>themselves </i>as gods.

40
00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:27.866
Cats don't want to do
what they don't like.

41
00:55:28.533 --> 00:55:30.577
They want to sleep
when they want to sleep.

42
00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:33.121
eat when they want to eat.
play when they want to play.

43
00:59:07.669 --> 00:59:11.589
I realized
that we can observe different behaviors

44
00:59:11.673 --> 00:59:15.343
in cats in the US and the ones in Japan.

45
00:59:17.971 --> 00:59:22.308
In Japan. cats have a hard time
with unfamiliar places.

46
00:59:23.851 --> 00:59:25.645
However. cats I saw in the US…

47
00:59:28.648 --> 00:59:34.237
…act normal even in unfamiliar places.

48
00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:41.244
So Japanese and American cats
might have different personalities.

49
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:07.312
I realized
that our cultural differences affect cats.

50
01:00:14.193 --> 01:00:17.614
Japan is an island nation.

51
01:00:18.823 --> 01:00:23.119
Most cat owners keep
their cats completely indoors.

52
01:00:23.202 --> 01:00:27.123
People in Japan
rarely have a party at home.

53
01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:30.835
Therefore. for cats in Japan.
the frequency of meeting strangers

54
01:00:30.918 --> 01:00:33.838
is much less than for cats in the US.

55
01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:39.385
These might be factors contributing
to the differences between cats in Japan

56
01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.471
and cats in the US.

57
01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:22.715
Cats love their owners very much.

58
01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:28.679
I believe that my cats definitely love me.

59
01:04:13.224 --> 01:04:17.812
There is still so much
we don't know about cats.

60
01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:21.107
The future will bring
more discoveries bit by bit.

61
01:04:50.803 --> 01:04:53.598
I can't imagine my life without cats.

62
01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:57.393
They are my animals. I feel them.

63
01:04:57.476 --> 01:05:00.980
And I hope they love me
as much as I love them.
