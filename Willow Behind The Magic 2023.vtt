Kit!

5
00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.441
- Hi. I'm Erin Kellyman.
- I'm Ruby Cruz.

6
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:26.526
- I'm Tony Revolori.
- I'm Ellie Bamber.

7
00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.486
- I'm Dempsey Bryk.
- I am Amar Chadha-Patel

8
00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:29.571
and this is your look at

9
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.281
the behind the scenes of the making of...

10
00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.825
<i>Willow.</i>

11
00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:48.173
{\an8}Starting about. I don't know.
ten years after the movie was released.

12
00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:52.177
a week would not go by without somebody
wanting to talk about <i>Willow.</i>

13
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.569
{\an8}Mm-hmm. First thing I did with George
was <i>Return of the Jedi.</i>

14
00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.239
<i>And then. I'd done the</i> Caravan of Courage
<i>and</i> Battle for Endor.

15
00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.868
And then. I went on to do <i>Labyrinth</i> which
George was involved in  again.

16
00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:19.120
AMAR CHADHA-PATEL: <i>I read
an interview about</i> Willow.

17
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.914
<i>where George Lucas had said that</i>

18
00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.916
<i>when he'd met Warwick
on the set of</i> Star Wars

19
00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.294
{\an8}that he wanted to make a story
where the hero was unlikely

20
00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:28.213
{\an8}and not what you would
expect a hero to be.

21
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.467
<i>So I watched the original
to refresh my memory of everything</i>

22
00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:36.805
{\an8}and all the characters and kind of.
to remember how fun it was and how...

23
00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:38.932
{\an8}I mean. how iconic it was. actually.

24
00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.892
{\an8}<i>How many times
have you worked with George?</i>

25
00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:42.936
{\an8}- It's my third one.
- What were the other two?

26
00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.771
<i>Uh. I did</i> Raiders of the Lost Ark.

27
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.481
<i>And. um.</i> Indiana Jones.

28
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:47.857
<i>And. of course. this one.</i>

29
00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:51.152
He's killed me four times in three films.
He doesn't like me.

30
00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:55.448
{\an8}I feel like it's a movie
that doesn't take itself too seriously.

31
00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.248
Excuse me. are we having a party?

32
00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:04.332
- Huh?

33
00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:06.626
{\an8}You have this incredible experience.
which I did.

34
00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:09.879
{\an8}on the film and Ron Howard. directing.
George Lucas. producing.

35
00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.424
<i>It's my first real movie
and it's this giant. epic production.</i>

36
00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:16.010
<i>It was out-of-this-world
and extraordinary.</i>

37
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.887
{\an8}I was captivated by it.

38
00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:23.685
<i>I was captivated by Warwick.
and by Joanne. and by Val Kilmer.</i>

39
00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:25.436
Obviously.

40
00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:28.064
<i>We were all just
absolutely obsessed with it.</i>

41
00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:31.484
You know. it was successful
when it came out. it was well-regarded.

42
00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:35.738
But it. you know. it didn't have this.
sort of. place in pop culture.

43
00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:39.200
{\an8}I sort of tended to gravitate
toward the idea that.

44
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.872
while. like. <i>Indiana Jones</i> and <i>Star Wars</i>
were the biggest things ever.

45
00:02:43.872 --> 00:02:46.875
there was this other thing.
There was <i>Willow.</i>

46
00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:52.463
<i>George Lucas had always
wanted. not so much to do a sequel.</i>

47
00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:54.591
<i>but to develop it further on television.</i>

48
00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:58.553
<i>And when Disney Plus came along.
suddenly we felt like.</i>

49
00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:00.513
well. there's a real home for this.

50
00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:04.017
{\an8}To all the fans who've waited
over 30 years. the wait is over.

51
00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:08.438
{\an8}Kasdan from his original conversations
with Ron Howard.

52
00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.440
<i>he's been kind of
building this world up</i>

53
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.652
<i>and bringing his own kind of sensibility.
humor. and heart.</i>

54
00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:15.945
{\an8}It has nostalgia. of course.

55
00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:17.947
{\an8}for those of us
that love the original movie.

56
00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:20.033
<i>But it feels so fresh and modern</i>

57
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.786
<i>and he has managed to bring it
into a brand new moment in time.</i>

58
00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:29.125
So there's this specificity to <i>Willow</i>
and to the Lucasfilm brand.

59
00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.502
<i>And so. my mind kept going to this. like.</i>

60
00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:34.380
<i>dusty volume
sitting on a shelf somewhere</i>

61
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.382
<i>with "Willow" on its spine.</i>

62
00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.468
And like.
I wanted to write more of that book.

63
00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:42.013
{\an8}Jon Kasdan encourages
a very inventive and bold approach.

64
00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:46.935
<i>But he also respects the skills
and the different qualities</i>

65
00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.645
<i>each cast member brings.</i>

66
00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.188
<i>I think as a new cast.</i>

67
00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:54.943
{\an8}there is pressure stepping in and
taking over. like. such a beloved story.

68
00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.572
<i>Reading the scripts</i>

69
00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.908
<i>and getting a sense
of the premise for the show.</i>

70
00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:06.412
this thing was gonna live or die
according to the cast.

71
00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:11.209
<i>So I was kinda nervous about
meeting the new team. as it were.</i>

72
00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.503
And they're so brilliant.
they're so brilliant.

73
00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:16.798
<i>It's been a joy.
a genuine joy working with them.</i>

74
00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.424
The repartee that is between them.

75
00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.426
that isn't something
anyone needs to direct.

76
00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.637
Uh. it's been a crazy day.
We've had a lot of...

77
00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.639
- Where?
- It's that way.

78
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.516
- What?
- Lot of horse work going on today.

79
00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:27.642
- Uh...
- I think... No.

80
00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:30.270
- Amar. you gettin' on? Ruby?
- CHADHA-PATEL: No. I'll get the next one.

81
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.437
- Oh.
- Okay.

82
00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.564
As you can see.
a lot of horse work going on.

83
00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:38.528
<i>I met Ruby. who plays Kit.
who's my twin. on a FaceTime.</i>

84
00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.280
- Oh. hey there. What's up?
- Hey.

85
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.616
{\an8}And within two seconds
I said. "I think I know you."

86
00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.577
<i>And then. progressively person.
by person. by person</i>

87
00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:49.455
<i>who I met.
we all kinda said the same thing.</i>

88
00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:53.376
{\an8}These people are my family.
I've been with them for so long.

89
00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:57.839
<i>When we're all six of us are together.
like. that's always very fun. you know.</i>

90
00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:02.677
Um. we can never get anything shot.
but it's very fun.

91
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.637
Reach out to me.

92
00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.559
<i>What was it like
working with Warwick Davis?</i>

93
00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.020
Um...

94
00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.899
Warwick has a lot of passion.

95
00:05:17.608 --> 00:05:20.236
Like. well.
like a. like a lot of passion.

96
00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:21.321
Really passionate.

97
00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:30.747
He has so many great ideas.

98
00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.501
Warwick is. uh...

99
00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:40.006
He's very... intense.

100
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.807
Can we get this thing towed
at owner's expense. please?

101
00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:53.353
He just has ideas.
He has a lot of ideas. Um...

102
00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.272
<i>For everyone about everything.</i>

103
00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.400
Whether you want them or not.

104
00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:03.279
How's that?

105
00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.157
{\an8}He likes to remind people
he's number one on the call sheet

106
00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:09.369
{\an8}which is... which is helpful. I think.

107
00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:11.788
{\an8}Quiet. please.

108
00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.123
{\an8}Don't wanna do this twice.

109
00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:17.168
And three. two. one.

110
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.421
I'm Warwick Davis
and I play Willow.

111
00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:24.384
Hang on. No. do it again.
That was rubbish.

112
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.556
<i>We have some of the best</i>

113
00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:33.684
<i>hair people. makeup people.
set designer people</i>

114
00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:36.854
{\an8}who have put such a show together

115
00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:43.903
{\an8}that I have come in here and I'm just
blown away at the level of detail.

116
00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:45.947
<i>I really liked the troll set.</i>

117
00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:49.617
It was cool to walk around in there.
it's very easy to actually get lost.

118
00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:51.953
<i>It's a whole thing as well.
It's a real maze.</i>

119
00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:55.623
<i>It's not just one tiny. little corner
that everyone squeezes into.</i>

120
00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:57.500
<i>They built a whole thing.</i>

121
00:06:58.167 --> 00:06:59.502
<i>This is a great crew.</i>

122
00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:03.005
<i>Everybody from art department. um.
who've been looking at creative ways</i>

123
00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:04.841
<i>to accomplish everything
you see behind us.</i>

124
00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:08.136
{\an8}And then the things you can't see
is what visual effects is gonna do later.

125
00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.096
<i>We have Industrial Light & Magic on</i>

126
00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.306
<i>to supervise
all the visual effects for this work.</i>

127
00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:15.435
<i>Um. this is gonna be epic. even though
this is already an epic location.</i>

128
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.604
<i>Instead of being this height.
it's gonna be five or ten times taller</i>

129
00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.481
<i>when we get into visual effects world.</i>

130
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:24.485
<i>So we're
in Bavmorda's chamber or High Tower.</i>

131
00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:27.280
{\an8}That's where the climax
of <i>Willow</i> 1988 happens.

132
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.031
<i>We see our characters from 1988</i>

133
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.742
<i>and they interact
with our characters from 2021.</i>

134
00:07:31.742 --> 00:07:33.870
<i>We looked in the archives
to try and find out</i>

135
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.914
<i>um. what suitable angles
would help tell the story.</i>

136
00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:40.251
<i>So try to line up whatever footage
we had with the POVs</i>

137
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:44.380
<i>and made sure that our characters
from 2021 were in the right position.</i>

138
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.717
<i>so they would line up
with the footage that we have to hand.</i>

139
00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:50.636
<i>So I'd imagine it'll take our team
about three or four months</i>

140
00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:53.389
<i>to pull this together
and see 'em in this environment.</i>

141
00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:56.017
<i>And seeing these sets
reconstructed for the series</i>

142
00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.019
<i>has been quite somethin' as well.</i>

143
00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.771
<i>'Cause I believe
that most of this location</i>

144
00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:02.440
in the movie was a painting.

145
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:07.236
In the original movie. this dais part
was the only thing that existed.

146
00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:09.280
<i>The rest of it was a matte painting.</i>

147
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.449
<i>Kristian and his team
did an incredible job.</i>

148
00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:15.703
{\an8}We wanted to have it very similar
to what it looked like in the movie.

149
00:08:15.703 --> 00:08:17.914
- <i>And Neal Scanlan</i>

150
00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:20.917
<i>and the creatures department
are legendary.</i>

151
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:26.756
<i>They've worked with Lucasfilm and ILM
a lot on various</i> Star Wars <i>projects.</i>

152
00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:31.344
The attention to detail is wonderful
within the creature department.

153
00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:36.140
<i>You get a drawing. you get a maquette.
you get a full size sculpt.</i>

154
00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:39.060
<i>You're given a chance to give notes</i>

155
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.730
<i>to discuss possibilities
of how it'll look for real.</i>

156
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.025
{\an8}Uh. to me. workin' on <i>Willow</i>
has been really demanding. actually.

157
00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:50.112
<i>Creating new characters
and starting afresh was amazing</i>

158
00:08:50.112 --> 00:08:53.866
<i>and to find solution
to what Jon was writing was really fun.</i>

159
00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:56.202
Three. two. one. action!

160
00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.286
Going down.

161
00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.164
CHADHA-PATEL: <i>Yeah.
the creatures are amazing.</i>

162
00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:03.543
Actually. my favorite creatures
were the. um. the wererats.

163
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.461
- Okay. look out for the wererats.
- What?

164
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:06.587
See ya.

165
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:10.049
CHADHA-PATEL: <i>Kit and Boorman go
on a little side quest in episode three</i>

166
00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.467
<i>and we get attacked by wererats</i>

167
00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:14.637
<i>and there was this crazy.
two-headed rat that attacks Kit</i>

168
00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.473
<i>while I'm down a well.
and just doing my own thing. Um...</i>

169
00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:20.977
<i>And the puppetry was.
I mean. it's classic CFX.</i>

170
00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:25.106
<i>Like. fully armatured puppets
with moving parts</i>

171
00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:28.734
<i>and fingers and eyes
and it looked so creepy and real.</i>

172
00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:30.820
It was covered in slime and gross.
I loved it.

173
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.032
{\an8}When I met my first troll.
I was totally gob smacked.

174
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:41.038
<i>Uh. the detail that Neal had put into
the face. the wrinkles. everything.</i>

175
00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:44.125
<i>Even the little warty things
that they had on their bodies.</i>

176
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:48.546
{\an8}Uh. people always ask me. you know.
do I use Stanislavski or Meisner.

177
00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.506
Which I always tell them
is a trick question

178
00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:53.467
because there would be
no Meisner without Stanislavski.

179
00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:55.970
<i>And. Pippa.
the makeup designer. as well.</i>

180
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.180
<i>I think her work is awe-inspiring.</i>

181
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.226
<i>I think she brings a wonderful
naturalism to everything she does.</i>

182
00:10:02.226 --> 00:10:05.313
{\an8}We thought we'd bring the world to life
with all of our backgrounds.

183
00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:08.608
Backgrounds have got all the interesting
hair and everything like that.

184
00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.818
<i>Like our Tir Asleeners
we could go quite far with.</i>

185
00:10:10.818 --> 00:10:12.778
<i>We needed our heroes
to be really relatable.</i>

186
00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:15.031
<i>We needed everyone
that watches it to kinda go.</i>

187
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:18.367
"Oh. that... I kinda... I could be
that person. that could be me." you know?

188
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:26.208
- Oh. Yeah.

189
00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:30.379
I was telling the crew how you do
everyone's makeup except your own.

190
00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:32.632
- which is virtually impossible.
- Mmm.

191
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.509
{\an8}I'd say Warwick is very hands-on.

192
00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:43.517
Yeah. I think... hands-on
is a good way of describing it.

193
00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:44.644
<i>I'm a perfectionist.</i>

194
00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:48.189
<i>Every tiny detail on the film set matters.</i>

195
00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.732
And I wanna be part of that.

196
00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:55.029
<i>I mean.
the guy has an incredible work ethic.</i>

197
00:10:55.029 --> 00:11:00.826
<i>He's involved in wardrobe.
makeup. production design.</i>

198
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.245
{\an8}He's our on-set medic.

199
00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:07.041
{\an8}which is weird
because he doesn't really have

200
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:10.670
any medical background or training at all.

201
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.589
Part of me thinks it is very irresponsible

202
00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:17.009
and also weird
that he's chosen to be the medic.

203
00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:20.012
But then. on the other hand.
I was chokin' on a chicken bone.

204
00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:21.681
And he did save my life. so.

205
00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:25.184
And then. you know.
there's the transportation thing

206
00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:30.314
which is that he insists on picking up
all of the actors at their homes.

207
00:11:30.314 --> 00:11:34.860
<i>The actors appreciate it but. weirdly.
like. he'll do it for all of them.</i>

208
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.404
Except for Ellie.

209
00:11:40.282 --> 00:11:44.662
<i>Seems to be like
actively sabotaging her call sheet.</i>

210
00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:48.332
Yeah. Lovely.

211
00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:50.251
{\an8}Thanks. Warwick. That's great.

212
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:51.335
{\an8}Thanks. Amanda.

213
00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:54.380
{\an8}Um. so we're gonna do
a few now with Ellie. if that's okay.

214
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.966
- Oh. yeah.
- So. yeah. where is she? Where's Ellie?

215
00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.050
No idea.

216
00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.094
- Hello?

217
00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:03.597
It's locked from the outside. Hello?

218
00:12:03.597 --> 00:12:05.099
We got some great ones of me.
didn't we?

219
00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:06.642
- Yes. Yours was...
- Yeah.

220
00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:08.310
Thank you.
Yeah. no. they were great.

221
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.272
Well. this is <i>Willow.</i> after all.
So. uh. that's all you need.

222
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.024
- Absolutely. yes.
- Good.

223
00:12:14.024 --> 00:12:18.362
{\an8}I think we were most excited about
continuing the story of Elora Danan

224
00:12:18.362 --> 00:12:20.448
<i>who. of course. we only saw as a baby</i>

225
00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:24.201
and is now moved
into the central role of this series.

226
00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.537
<i>This is the baby
that he saved.</i>

227
00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:29.707
<i>This is the person that he. sort of. lost.</i>

228
00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:30.791
She's back.

229
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:33.627
<i>I remember we sat down
with Warwick and told him</i>

230
00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:36.172
<i>that Elora Danan
would finally be in this story</i>

231
00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:38.507
<i>and become the central character.</i>

232
00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:41.761
And his response immediately was. "Why?"

233
00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:48.017
I genuinely. actually think Warwick
is a bit like. intimidated by Ellie?

234
00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:52.688
I don't wanna say
that it's sabotage.

235
00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:58.527
But. but it is. It's sabotage. I think.

236
00:12:58.527 --> 00:13:01.572
{\an8} No. that's ridiculous.
Are you kidding?

237
00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:03.365
Warwick really likes me.

238
00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:06.076
I think. maybe. at one point.
he got the idea that...

239
00:13:06.076 --> 00:13:07.161
Oh.

240
00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:10.289
I wanted to call the show <i>Elora Danan</i>

241
00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:12.249
- and he heard about that...
- Oh.

242
00:13:12.249 --> 00:13:14.210
Okay. Ellie.
We're ready for you on set now.

243
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.336
Thank you. Alec.

244
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.172
<i>A major through line
in season one</i>

245
00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:22.760
<i>is Elora Danan learning to become
more powerful than Willow as a sorcerer.</i>

246
00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:27.348
<i>Uh. so the fact that her wands
kept disappearing from set</i>

247
00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:30.392
{\an8}was unsubtle and problematic.

248
00:13:30.392 --> 00:13:32.603
{\an8}I think Warwick's been
snappin' Ellie's wands.

249
00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:34.313
In fact. I know he has.

250
00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:36.565
We've got security cameras.

251
00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:38.400
<i>Wait for it.</i>

252
00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:40.611
<i>Okay.</i>

253
00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:42.530
<i>Look. look. look. Okay. look!</i>

254
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.781
<i>There's the snatch.</i>

255
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.408
<i>There's the snap. See?</i>

256
00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:48.994
<i>Do you know how many wands
we've gone through?</i>

257
00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:50.579
<i>Must be like. 37.</i>

258
00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:52.915
What the ?

259
00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:55.376
- Right. Okay.
- Then we get to the jump.

260
00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:57.711
The horse is blind.
he doesn't know where he's going.

261
00:13:57.711 --> 00:14:00.339
- He doesn't know where he's going.
- And here we go. three. two. one.

262
00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.007
<i>Hsu-gala!</i>

263
00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:04.134
Thank you so much.
You did a great job today.

264
00:14:04.134 --> 00:14:05.219
Thank you very much.

265
00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:07.596
Hi. are you all right?

266
00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:11.058
{\an8}Yeah. definitely.

267
00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:12.393
{\an8}Hi. how do you do?

268
00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:14.979
We're gonna have a body land.

269
00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:16.939
- boom. on the floor!
- Bang!

270
00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:20.192
<i>CC and his team
did a fantastic job.</i>

271
00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:22.945
<i>you know. all of the actors
were doing all of their own work</i>

272
00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:25.239
<i>in there which is sensational.</i>

273
00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:28.784
<i>We put the cast through
an awful lot of. um.</i>

274
00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:30.911
{\an8}physical rigor  on this shoot.

275
00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:32.538
Oh. .

276
00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.248
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. All good.

277
00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:36.208
- These actors. I gotta say.
- They're so great.

278
00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:38.085
- I mean. it's been incredible
- And so game.

279
00:14:38.085 --> 00:14:40.254
<i>to watch them grow.</i>

280
00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.964
<i>Seeing them fight so well.</i>

281
00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:43.841
<i>Yeah. we have a great young cast.</i>

282
00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:48.971
{\an8}<i>Ellen. Mario. Dennis...</i>

283
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:55.185
<i>And there's Tommy. Arianna. And Robin.</i>

284
00:14:55.185 --> 00:14:57.646
And they're all relatively.
uh. good in the show.

285
00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:00.816
<i>The big fellow
is a bit of a klutz. though.</i>

286
00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:03.736
CHADHA-PATEL: <i>We have
an amazing stunt team. obviously.</i>

287
00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:06.280
<i>Luke. my stunt double.
he's an incredible sword fighter.</i>

288
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.032
and he teaches me how to sword fight.

289
00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:10.284
<i>The beauty of it is that
he'll teach me these moves</i>

290
00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:11.994
<i>that are incredible
but when I do them.</i>

291
00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:14.872
I make 'em look bad
'cause I'm. I'm like a grasshopper.

292
00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:17.666
From my side of it.
we've got horses in there.

293
00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:22.296
<i>we've got trolls. we've got falls.
we've got fights everywhere.</i>

294
00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:25.090
There's sword fights everywhere.
And I'm havin' a great time.

295
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:28.344
Amazing!

296
00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:32.264
<i>CC and the team. I mean.
these guys are the best in the biz.</i>

297
00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:34.516
<i>And they're doing a great job.</i>

298
00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:37.144
<i>They. essentially.
design the fights in a way</i>

299
00:15:37.144 --> 00:15:39.897
<i>where it's everything
that we're capable of.</i>

300
00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:43.275
<i>They don't really put anything
in that us as actors can't do.</i>

301
00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:46.445
<i>So we're able to really do it
and get into it 'cause they're incredible.</i>

302
00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:49.365
I can't speak highly enough about them.
So. we're really just lucky.

303
00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:50.991
CHADHA-PATEL: <i>Dempsey Bryk as Airk.</i>

304
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:54.411
<i>"Bryk" by name. "brick" by nature.
He's been my rock.</i>

305
00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:57.998
He and I have been gym partners.

306
00:15:57.998 --> 00:15:59.583
<i>We've all had to train.</i>

307
00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:01.460
<i>We did a. a month of boot camp.</i>

308
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:07.591
{\an8}I'm very grateful for the month-long
boot camp that we got to do

309
00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:09.635
{\an8}because I would've... Oh.

310
00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:13.222
{\an8}It would've been tragic
if I wasn't training.

311
00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:15.099
<i>But it was really physically demanding.</i>

312
00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:17.768
<i>Probably the most physically
demanding thing I've ever done.</i>

313
00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:18.852
<i>But so paying off.</i>

314
00:16:18.852 --> 00:16:21.021
<i>Like. I can't believe
I know how to sword fight now.</i>

315
00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:22.856
It is the coolest thing.

316
00:16:22.856 --> 00:16:25.109
{\an8}Joanne. who plays Sorsha.

317
00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:28.570
<i>loved coming out
and playing in the Gales fight.</i>

318
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:33.742
And she absolutely
has to front it out with the Doom.

319
00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:43.460
<i>With these magical whips.
whipping back and forth at her.</i>

320
00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:49.842
{\an8}Sorsha has the weight of the world
on her shoulders

321
00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.761
because she's starting
to see things and hear things.

322
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:56.223
<i>- And then. the Death Dogs appear...</i>

323
00:16:56.223 --> 00:17:00.310
and she knows that if the Death Dogs
are around then it's all gonna kick off.

324
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.812
Death Dogs.

325
00:17:02.479 --> 00:17:05.858
<i>And I have to get my sword out
that I have put away.</i>

326
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.901
<i>It's really fun doing a fight again.</i>

327
00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:11.822
I haven't had a fight for ages.
It's really fun.

328
00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:14.366
I can assure you.
whatever's out there.

329
00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:17.161
my knights are. are more than capable...

330
00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:18.620
You were a bit early there. Martin.

331
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.998
- Yep. I'm sorry about that.
- Let's just reset Martin.

332
00:17:20.998 --> 00:17:22.916
- You can do it separately.

333
00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:24.376
It was so fun.

334
00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:30.758
<i>Now. people watching this may think</i>

335
00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:32.843
<i>that this was all shot
against a green screen.</i>

336
00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:35.095
In fact. we are actually
out here on the beach.

337
00:17:35.095 --> 00:17:37.681
in the elements. shooting this for real.

338
00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:39.975
{\an8}We really wanted to create our own world.

339
00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:41.852
<i>It needs to be fantastical</i>

340
00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:45.397
<i>and have that kinda slightly
other-worldly feel to it.</i>

341
00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:47.483
{\an8}Welcome to the Bone Reaver encampment.

342
00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:50.694
{\an8}<i>We're in the Forest of Dean.
Very special place.</i>

343
00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:53.197
{\an8}<i>It's basically an area
that was a woodland once</i>

344
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:55.949
{\an8}and it's collapsed.
it's mines underneath and. a cave system.

345
00:17:55.949 --> 00:17:57.659
<i>And it's all collapsed.</i>

346
00:17:57.659 --> 00:18:01.163
A lot of it is not us. it's all natural.
but we've put in the doors.

347
00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:02.247
<i>All the timber work.</i>

348
00:18:03.123 --> 00:18:06.376
<i>If you look carefully. there's a load
of skulls and just hidden around.</i>

349
00:18:06.376 --> 00:18:09.379
<i>So. as we're goin' around.
you can just see all the details.</i>

350
00:18:10.297 --> 00:18:14.343
We tried to stay clear
of using real Medieval architecture.

351
00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.386
We didn't use any real castles.

352
00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:21.225
<i>We do have one or two ruins.
uh. one of them being Neath Abbey</i>

353
00:18:21.225 --> 00:18:25.771
<i>which. uh. the heroes run through
in the beginning of episode five.</i>

354
00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.025
<i>We're not in Europe
and we're not even in the Medieval times.</i>

355
00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:31.652
<i>We are in a fantasy world.</i>

356
00:18:31.652 --> 00:18:36.907
So the Willow production being based
entirely in Wales has been great for us.

357
00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:39.827
<i>There's something mythic
about the Welsh countryside</i>

358
00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:42.204
<i>that isn't the same as anywhere else.</i>

359
00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:44.456
<i>You know.
we're making a road movie. obviously.</i>

360
00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:46.750
<i>So. we need to find
a lot of places that feel.</i>

361
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:51.255
kind of. distinctly different
and can progress in a distinct way.

362
00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:54.174
{\an8}I think the biggest benefit
is the diversity of locations.

363
00:18:54.174 --> 00:18:59.471
<i>And having wide-open space.
so close to the studio.</i>

364
00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:01.431
<i>Within one hour of Cardiff.</i>

365
00:19:01.431 --> 00:19:04.893
<i>you can shoot on beaches. in forests.</i>

366
00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:09.523
<i>by lakes. up valleys. in mountains.</i>

367
00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:14.027
<i>It's been an awesome experience
to get the camera.</i>

368
00:19:14.027 --> 00:19:18.073
the crew. the cast
into the most amazing places.

369
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.035
<i>I've got many fond memories
of filming in Wales on the first film.</i>

370
00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:25.122
<i>So I think it was great that we went back
to Wales for the series.</i>

371
00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:27.291
Basically. we had to go back there again.

372
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:32.671
Willow...

373
00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:35.841
Let's ride.

374
00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:43.307
You know. after the first <i>Willow</i> came out.
I was on fire.

375
00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:45.893
<i>The first movie
went to his head a little bit.</i>

376
00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:48.020
<i>I mean. to be totally honest.</i>

377
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:53.192
I think he perceives it
as more successful than it actually was.

378
00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:56.695
I had big ideas.
Big ideas. I'm tellin' ya.

379
00:19:56.695 --> 00:20:01.116
He pitched me maybe.
20 ideas for <i>Willow</i> sequels.

380
00:20:01.116 --> 00:20:03.452
None of them really made any sense.

381
00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:04.828
I invented the colon.

382
00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.458
Yeah. the colon.

383
00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:12.920
Basically allows you to make
the same movie over and over again.

384
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.088
You take the title.
put a colon after it.

385
00:20:15.088 --> 00:20:16.506
give it another title.

386
00:20:16.506 --> 00:20:17.799
I wrote loads of them.

387
00:20:17.799 --> 00:20:20.844
{\an8}Willow. <i>colon.</i> Bavmorda's Revenge.

388
00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:23.972
{\an8}Willow. <i>colon.</i> Lost in New York.

389
00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:27.392
{\an8}Willow. <i>colon.</i> Spring Break.
<i>colon.</i> Miami Beach.

390
00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:28.977
{\an8}<i>That's a double colon. that one.</i>

391
00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:31.813
{\an8}Willow. <i>colon.</i> Willow's Colon.

392
00:20:31.813 --> 00:20:35.525
{\an8}which was a public service film
about gastrointestinal health.

393
00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:37.527
Very important.

394
00:20:37.527 --> 00:20:41.365
In his mind. he thought he was creating
the world's first mega franchise.

395
00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:42.741
That wasn't a thing.

396
00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:45.786
<i>There was a lot of opportunity
for me in those days.</i>

397
00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:48.830
<i>I was getting offered some exciting roles</i>

398
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.166
<i>up against some of the biggest actors
in Hollywood.</i>

399
00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:55.087
And that's. uh. that's when I met him.

400
00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:58.548
The weasel.

401
00:20:58.548 --> 00:21:01.593
What can I say.
I'm just thrilled to be a part of it.

402
00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:04.930
The coup
and the ultimate score for our show

403
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.766
was getting Christian Slater to come in
and play Allagash.

404
00:21:08.725 --> 00:21:10.769
<i>And the cast was excited.</i>

405
00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:12.729
<i>Disney was excited.</i>

406
00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:15.482
Warwick was less excited.

407
00:21:15.482 --> 00:21:20.612
It turned out.
they had a long and complicated history.

408
00:21:21.321 --> 00:21:24.574
The Warwick Davis-Christian Slater rivalry.

409
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.370
That... That was the stuff
of Hollywood legend.

410
00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.664
He stole my idea.

411
00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:31.999
We were mates.

412
00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:33.667
I took him out to lunch.

413
00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:37.254
told him about this passion project
I'd been working on between <i>Willows.</i>

414
00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:39.965
It was about this sexy DJ
in Brixton. London.

415
00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.801
called <i>Would You Mind
Turning Up The Music. Please?</i>

416
00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:46.221
<i>And six months later.
saw a movie poster for a film.</i>

417
00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:49.766
rather rudely entitled.
<i>Pump Up The Volume.</i>

418
00:21:49.766 --> 00:21:52.144
He basically accused me of plagiarism.

419
00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:54.479
In his version of events I. what.

420
00:21:55.063 --> 00:21:57.649
uh. stole his idea.
hired a writer and director.

421
00:21:57.649 --> 00:22:00.861
made the movie and released it in theaters
in like six months?

422
00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:02.654
I mean. how would that even work?

423
00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:06.491
But. uh. man. he was pissed.
He. uh. he came at me. hard.

424
00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:08.118
What? That's what he said?

425
00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:10.287
I came at him hard? Can you imagine that?

426
00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:11.705
I'm British.

427
00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:14.333
I don't do things like that.
I'm a gentleman.

428
00:22:28.221 --> 00:22:31.516
Yeah. he threatened to sue me
in the most English way possible.

429
00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:36.229
And sadly. we never spoke again after that
until this.

430
00:22:37.064 --> 00:22:40.317
The Disney team
have been looking at the dailies

431
00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:42.778
and they're so excited about Christian

432
00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:46.198
and what season two
could be like if you guys are like.

433
00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:49.910
you know. like. buddies and.
like. on an adventure.

434
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.496
- You seem like you're shaking your head.
- Whoa. Wait a minute.

435
00:22:52.996 --> 00:22:55.290
If they put Christian Slater
on Disney Plus.

436
00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.834
they're gonna have to change the name
to Disney Minus.

437
00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:00.045
Hey. guys. Yeah.

438
00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:01.755
- Good to see you.

439
00:23:01.755 --> 00:23:03.131
- It's good to have you here.
- Yeah.

440
00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:05.300
Thanks. man.
No. it's great to be here.

441
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.720
They finally arrive
at the silent. burnt-out ruins.

442
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.724
{\an8}<i>The beauty of the series
is that it really walks this fine line</i>

443
00:23:12.724 --> 00:23:16.853
{\an8}<i>between being funny as it should be</i>

444
00:23:16.853 --> 00:23:19.856
<i>and this kind of dramatic fantasy</i>

445
00:23:19.856 --> 00:23:23.235
{\an8}that we've kind of grown accustomed to
with <i>Game of Thrones</i> and such.

446
00:23:24.444 --> 00:23:28.115
<i>while also keepin' it contemporary
in a way that's fresh and new.</i>

447
00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:31.076
<i>And it really all just kind of stems
from the mind of Jon Kasdan</i>

448
00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:32.619
who is our show runner and writer.

449
00:23:32.619 --> 00:23:35.872
Jon Kasdan is a very special man.

450
00:23:35.872 --> 00:23:40.210
I think Jon is one of the most creative
individuals I've ever met.

451
00:23:40.877 --> 00:23:42.629
<i>The way he sees this world as something</i>

452
00:23:42.629 --> 00:23:45.966
<i>that is just as valuable now
as when it was created.</i>

453
00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:49.803
<i>You know. Jon has been wonderful
in allowing us to come in.</i>

454
00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:54.099
you know. and to have some fun with it
and be loose with it.

455
00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:57.436
<i>and I think that is the right energy
for this type of story.</i>

456
00:23:57.436 --> 00:23:58.520
<i>I'm free...</i>

457
00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.980
- This guy's insane.

458
00:24:00.355 --> 00:24:03.316
This must be
like a dream come true to Jon.

459
00:24:03.316 --> 00:24:08.655
<i>To have eight hours to explore
your childhood adventures</i>

460
00:24:08.655 --> 00:24:11.533
with this massive great team
and this wonderful cast.

461
00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:13.285
Willow!

462
00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:15.203
{\an8}I said yes and came aboard

463
00:24:15.203 --> 00:24:18.415
{\an8}'cause I didn't wanna shatter
his childhood dreams

464
00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:20.625
which clearly this represents.

465
00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:22.919
This is not nostalgia.

466
00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:27.257
It's using the fundamentals
of this world. these characters

467
00:24:27.257 --> 00:24:31.052
<i>but it's very forward thinking
in terms of its sensibilities.</i>

468
00:24:31.052 --> 00:24:34.931
<i>uh. and also.
the adventure that it creates.</i>

469
00:24:34.931 --> 00:24:38.018
<i>I feel like there's something
for everyone in this series.</i>

470
00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:43.273
<i>There are just so many storylines
and characters all weaved together.</i>

471
00:24:43.273 --> 00:24:45.442
There's definitely been days

472
00:24:45.442 --> 00:24:48.612
where I am laughing
and crying and screaming all in one day

473
00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:53.783
<i>and</i>  <i>I mean.
it's crazy for my emotional health</i>

474
00:24:53.783 --> 00:24:56.161
but it.
you know. gets it all out.

475
00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:59.164
I mean. the beauty of fantasy
and sci-fi is that it's not Earth

476
00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:02.000
<i>so you can put anyone
of any diverse background</i>

477
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.711
<i>in what essentially is a world
full of dragons and giants.</i>

478
00:25:05.295 --> 00:25:11.009
Um. if you can have giants and trolls.
why can't you have brown people?

479
00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:14.804
We talk about the impact that these little
moments are gonna have on children

480
00:25:14.804 --> 00:25:18.058
<i>and being able to see themselves
and think. "Yeah. I wanna be that."</i>

481
00:25:18.058 --> 00:25:21.269
I mean. I said this to Jon Kasdan
when I first had my meeting.

482
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:22.521
my first meeting with him.

483
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:24.731
<i>You know. Indiana Jones. Han Solo.</i>

484
00:25:24.731 --> 00:25:26.650
<i>characters that every kid wanted to be.</i>

485
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:30.654
<i>but as an Asian man.
I never saw myself reflected in that way.</i>

486
00:25:30.654 --> 00:25:34.199
<i>The comedic rogue with a heart of gold
character played by an Asian person</i>

487
00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:35.825
so for me it's a huge honor

488
00:25:35.825 --> 00:25:38.161
and I'm very excited
and hope to bring it to life.

489
00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:39.746
and not ruin it and get fired.

490
00:25:40.747 --> 00:25:41.915
Which is a possibility.

491
00:25:42.582 --> 00:25:44.834
And in about ten seconds.
I'm gonna kiss you.

492
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.294
So. if you don't want that...

493
00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:50.131
Yes. I would...
I mean. I would be very into that.

494
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:55.845
So absolutely excited to be able
to represent the LGBTQ plus community

495
00:25:55.845 --> 00:25:59.307
<i>on screen especially something
as wide scale as Disney.</i>

496
00:25:59.307 --> 00:26:01.601
I think this is huge. That is...

497
00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:06.523
Ah!  That makes me so excited.
That makes me so happy.

498
00:26:06.523 --> 00:26:10.485
I honestly never thought I'd be playing
a queer character in a Disney show.

499
00:26:10.485 --> 00:26:16.449
<i>I think it's so important for young people
to see queer characters on shows.</i>

500
00:26:16.449 --> 00:26:17.701
Like. to see it on Disney. too.

501
00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:20.412
It's such a big platform
and it's gonna reach so many people

502
00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:24.249
<i>and if I had that when I was younger
I think I'd feel a lot less scared</i>

503
00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:27.961
<i>and a lot less intimidated by the thoughts
and feelings I was having.</i>

504
00:26:27.961 --> 00:26:30.880
And being a queer woman. and playing
a queer character on a Disney show

505
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.883
is honestly the most insane.

506
00:26:33.883 --> 00:26:37.137
it's the most insane thing.
I never thought I'd be able to do that.

507
00:26:37.137 --> 00:26:41.224
We're Thraxus
and you're watching the Disney Plus.

508
00:26:49.482 --> 00:26:50.525
That was good.

509
00:26:54.404 --> 00:26:55.405
CHADHA-PATEL: Okay. Jamie?

510
00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:56.948
That's
the last shot on <i>Willow.</i>

511
00:26:56.948 --> 00:26:58.325
Well done. everybody!

512
00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:04.623
<i>It has been a joyous experience</i>

513
00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:07.876
and I've loved working
with such talented people.

514
00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:12.881
<i>To become a part of something
that is so beloved by so many people</i>

515
00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:16.301
and to be able to just extend
that world even further

516
00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:18.345
into something
that even more people can love.

517
00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:20.096
I think is a really cool thing.

518
00:27:20.096 --> 00:27:23.558
{\an8}<i>There's lots of comedic moments.
there's lots of really tender moments</i>

519
00:27:23.558 --> 00:27:25.685
{\an8}<i>and there's a real journey to go on.</i>

520
00:27:25.685 --> 00:27:28.480
{\an8}It's just not typical.
it's not what you would expect.

521
00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.441
{\an8}<i>and I think that
that is something that is so exciting.</i>

522
00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:32.901
{\an8}You guys are the best! See you.

523
00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:35.111
{\an8}See you next year!

524
00:27:35.111 --> 00:27:38.448
<i>It's turned into like one
of the greatest experiences of my career</i>

525
00:27:38.448 --> 00:27:41.284
so I. I'm very happy to have said yes.

526
00:27:41.284 --> 00:27:43.703
<i>I don't wanna leave for real.</i>

527
00:27:43.703 --> 00:27:45.163
- I know.
- It's not even. like.

528
00:27:45.163 --> 00:27:48.458
I know this is an interview
but I'm actually so sad.

529
00:27:48.458 --> 00:27:53.046
{\an8}The overriding thing I'll take away
is a set that is full of warmth.

530
00:27:53.046 --> 00:27:56.841
<i>fun. great characters. lovely people.</i>

531
00:27:56.841 --> 00:28:01.721
<i>And a real energy to try
and do something a little bit different.</i>

532
00:28:03.139 --> 00:28:07.143
The truth is.
people thought Warwick was crazy.

533
00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:09.979
<i>But the reality
is he was just ahead of his time.</i>

534
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:14.734
I mean. yes. he can be difficult.
he can be challenging.

535
00:28:14.734 --> 00:28:17.529
<i>And he's got a big ego but you know what?</i>

536
00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:20.281
{\an8}<i>He's got an even bigger heart</i>

537
00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:23.827
{\an8}<i>and he brings out the very best in people</i>

538
00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:26.830
<i>and they bring out the best in him.</i>

539
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.665
And that's what <i>Willow</i> is all about.

540
00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:30.875
It's about heart.
and it's about friendship.

541
00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:32.460
it's about coming together.

542
00:28:33.044 --> 00:28:35.672
And magic. it's also about magic.

543
00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:37.966
Ellie. this is from Warwick.

544
00:28:37.966 --> 00:28:39.259
From Warwick? For me?

545
00:28:40.176 --> 00:28:42.178
Are you kidding? Look at the box.

546
00:28:44.264 --> 00:28:45.473
Oh.

547
00:28:45.473 --> 00:28:46.975
A new wand.

548
00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:50.228
Aw.

549
00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:52.147
Aw. he shouldn't have.

550
00:28:52.147 --> 00:28:56.609
{\an8}For me. this has been a dream that I've
had for. probably. about 30 years.

551
00:28:56.609 --> 00:28:58.111
Every fan of the movie said.

552
00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:00.572
"When will you make another <i>Willow?</i>
We want a sequel."

553
00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:03.491
And Jon here has realized that dream
for many millions of people

554
00:29:03.491 --> 00:29:05.160
around the world who loved the movie.

555
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.038
He always tells us to take in every moment
and appreciate all of the little things

556
00:29:09.038 --> 00:29:11.708
which I think
is why he does all these little things.

557
00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:13.418
<i>Like pick us up in the mornin'.</i>

558
00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:16.337
<i>He always reminds us
that everything can go by in a flash.</i>

559
00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:20.175
So to appreciate and love every moment
of every day with each other.

560
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.678
I mean. Warwick might have been
a bit hard on me

561
00:29:23.678 --> 00:29:27.348
but at the end of the day I think
it's because he believed in me.

562
00:29:28.558 --> 00:29:31.227
And now I'm very grateful for that.

563
00:29:33.062 --> 00:29:36.566
<i>Look. I may be Warwick Davis.
titular character of</i> Willow.

564
00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:38.610
<i>massive international movie star</i>

565
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:43.531
<i>with over $14.5 billion
in box office revenue and counting.</i>

566
00:29:43.531 --> 00:29:47.952
King of the Ewoks. polo buddy
to Prince William. yada. yada. yada.

567
00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:50.789
But the truth is
none of that really matters.

568
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:52.373
<i>What matters is this.</i>

569
00:29:53.374 --> 00:29:57.462
<i>What we've created here together
is just so much bigger than me.</i>

570
00:29:58.546 --> 00:30:00.590
<i>Maybe Willow isn't just one man.</i>

571
00:30:01.508 --> 00:30:04.052
<i>Maybe there's a little Willow
in all of us.</i>

572
00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:11.476
I am Willow.

573
00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:13.144
I am Willow?

574
00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:15.313
I am Willow.

575
00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:16.523
I'm Willow.

576
00:30:16.523 --> 00:30:17.941
I am Willow.

577
00:30:17.941 --> 00:30:20.568
This has been
the greatest adventure of my life.

578
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.032
But. uh. just to be clear.
contractually speaking.

579
00:30:26.032 --> 00:30:27.826
there is only one Willow.

580
00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:28.993
And that's me.

581
00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:38.211
<i>Have you seen
when he sits on a chair?</i>

582
00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.381
<i>Like. we've tried to talk about it</i>

583
00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.383
- and he doesn't want to.
- He didn't want to.

584
00:30:43.383 --> 00:30:46.094
<i>You have a reputation as a bit of a klutz.</i>

585
00:30:46.094 --> 00:30:48.680
No. No. I'm pretty coordinated.

586
00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.224
<i>I've been doing lot of stunt training
for this mother...</i>

587
00:30:51.224 --> 00:30:52.934
<i>Very complex fight sequences so...</i>

588
00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:55.728
There's a lot of broken chairs on set.

589
00:30:55.728 --> 00:30:58.648
- There's a giant easter egg and if you...
- Oh!

590
00:30:58.648 --> 00:31:00.859
Oh. my... It's okay. he has a problem.

591
00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:02.819
Don't draw attention to it.

592
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:03.987
It's a huge problem.

593
00:31:03.987 --> 00:31:07.490
<i>He's gonna hurt himself and more than
anything he's gonna hurt someone else.</i>

594
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.075
Have you seen Warwick?

595
00:31:09.075 --> 00:31:11.661
CHADHA-PATEL: What?

596
00:31:11.661 --> 00:31:13.413
I don't have a problem sitting down.

597
00:31:13.413 --> 00:31:14.956
You guys are making this up.
Making me...

598
00:31:14.956 --> 00:31:16.541
- I feel like you're gaslighting me.
- Okay.
