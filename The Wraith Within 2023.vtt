3
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:20.602
No. Dad. no.

4
00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:53.765
Hey!

5
00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:55.724
- You killed Mom!
- It wasn't my fault!

6
00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:57.508
- You killed Mom!
- You know what?

7
00:02:59.527 --> 00:03:00.615
Ami?

8
00:03:18.981 --> 00:03:20.504
Okay.

9
00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:24.116
Jason Voorhees.
Freddy Krueger. and Chucky.

10
00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:26.249
Oh. come on.

11
00:03:26.293 --> 00:03:28.860
Okay. marry Freddy.

12
00:03:28.904 --> 00:03:32.560
kill Jason.
and that leaves fuck Chucky?

13
00:03:32.603 --> 00:03:34.257
Yeah. fuck Chucky.

14
00:03:35.998 --> 00:03:37.478
Well. you go then.

15
00:03:38.043 --> 00:03:40.872
Marry Jason.
kill Jason. fuck Jason.

16
00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:42.222
In that order.

17
00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:44.441
Both of y'all
are dead to me.

18
00:03:50.142 --> 00:03:53.537
Bert. I swear. dude.
if you spill again.

19
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:55.931
I'm coming back there and
I'm gonna strangle you myself.

20
00:04:07.334 --> 00:04:08.509
Don't tickle me!

21
00:04:09.727 --> 00:04:11.338
Oh. God.

22
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:12.687
My lady.

23
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.602
Aw. you're so sweet.

24
00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:16.299
That's me.

25
00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:24.568
Uh.

26
00:04:25.047 --> 00:04:27.179
So. where should we go first?

27
00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:29.617
Oh. I wonder if that one
burger place is open.

28
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.706
- Uh. what's it called?
- Henry's.

29
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:33.447
Dude. that place had
the best shakes.

30
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.578
Good one.

31
00:04:34.622 --> 00:04:36.145
That sounds like a plan.

32
00:04:36.188 --> 00:04:38.016
but I think first we should
grab a few things

33
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.453
before heading out
to the cabin.

34
00:04:39.496 --> 00:04:40.932
Yeah. that's smart.

35
00:04:40.976 --> 00:04:42.107
Meet back here in 30 minutes?

36
00:04:42.717 --> 00:04:43.848
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

37
00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:45.807
Let's go. boy.

38
00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:48.331
Uh. sure. let's go.

39
00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:49.854
So what?

40
00:04:49.898 --> 00:04:51.334
You just want us wait here?

41
00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:53.815
Come on. Leyla.
let's go look around

42
00:04:53.858 --> 00:04:55.469
and see what's still here
after all these years.

43
00:04:56.818 --> 00:04:58.254
Well. I don't know
about you ladies.

44
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.082
but I have to change my shirt

45
00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:02.171
because certain somebodies
can't keep it in their pants.

46
00:05:02.214 --> 00:05:03.825
Okay. Bert.

47
00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:05.435
Yeah. just come find us
when you're done. okay?

48
00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.785
Hey. Leyla.
this taco's for you.

49
00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:09.918
Oh. fuck you. Bert.

50
00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:11.615
Bert!
All right. you know what?

51
00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:13.443
- Why don't you stay by the car?
- Oh. yeah.

52
00:05:14.923 --> 00:05:16.403
Yeah. it's good to be back.

53
00:05:17.186 --> 00:05:18.927
Fuck. man.
Why did you drag me into this?

54
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.320
I don't wanna go
shopping with you.

55
00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:22.496
Cory. I know
you hate shopping. bro.

56
00:05:23.714 --> 00:05:26.804
Look. we've grown close
over the years as brothers.

57
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.590
You look at me as. like.
your blood brother. right?

58
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.853
After what we've been through?

59
00:05:31.896 --> 00:05:32.984
Like. yeah. you're more
than a step brother.

60
00:05:33.507 --> 00:05:34.595
Why are you being weird?

61
00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:38.381
Oh. fuck.
Is that what I think it is?

62
00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:39.469
Sure is. bro.

63
00:05:40.252 --> 00:05:42.342
- It's long overdue.
- Yeah. you think?

64
00:05:42.951 --> 00:05:45.693
And I need
my best man to help me.

65
00:05:47.303 --> 00:05:49.261
All right. is this
going to be all for you today?

66
00:05:49.305 --> 00:05:50.741
- That's it.
- All right. just $5.

67
00:05:55.877 --> 00:05:57.531
All right.
Y'all have a great day.

68
00:05:57.574 --> 00:05:58.967
Enjoy that.

69
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.185
- Tell everyone I said hi.
- Will do.

70
00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:10.848
Well. well. well.
look what the cat dragged in.

71
00:06:10.892 --> 00:06:13.285
Oh. my God.
Is that you. Annie?

72
00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:16.114
You still fucking work here.

73
00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:18.856
Hey. watch your mouth.
My daughter's right here.

74
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.815
Okay.

75
00:06:20.858 --> 00:06:22.425
Oh. my God.

76
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:24.819
How are you two?
I haven't seen y'all--

77
00:06:24.862 --> 00:06:27.909
what. since
high school graduation?

78
00:06:27.952 --> 00:06:29.606
How have you been. Annie?

79
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.391
Um. I'm okay.

80
00:06:31.434 --> 00:06:33.175
Mommy. who are they?

81
00:06:33.218 --> 00:06:34.959
Don't point. baby.
It's not polite.

82
00:06:35.003 --> 00:06:36.874
Do you remember all those
pictures I showed you of me

83
00:06:36.918 --> 00:06:38.659
in my high school uniform?

84
00:06:38.702 --> 00:06:41.662
Well. these two... ladies.
were on the same team as me.

85
00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:44.447
- This is Jennifer and Leyla.
- Hi.

86
00:06:44.491 --> 00:06:46.275
Leyla was the one
I told you about.

87
00:06:46.318 --> 00:06:48.408
Who stole
my high school boyfriend

88
00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:49.800
and my homecoming queen title.

89
00:06:49.844 --> 00:06:51.889
Oh. my God.

90
00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:53.500
Still haven't let
that one go. hey?

91
00:06:53.543 --> 00:06:55.240
Oh. come off it. Leyla.

92
00:06:55.284 --> 00:06:57.591
You got everything
so easy in high school.

93
00:06:57.634 --> 00:06:59.854
You got off scot-free
with everything.

94
00:06:59.897 --> 00:07:01.246
You know
you stole Cory from me.

95
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.031
The two of you were pure evil.

96
00:07:03.074 --> 00:07:05.120
And you.
you just let it happen.

97
00:07:05.163 --> 00:07:07.427
Annie. come on.
That was forever ago.

98
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.863
We were just kids.

99
00:07:08.906 --> 00:07:10.386
Look. Leyla's
a different person now.

100
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.954
She's grown up. So have I.

101
00:07:12.997 --> 00:07:16.000
I work as a social worker with
addicts at an Austin hospital

102
00:07:16.044 --> 00:07:17.654
and Leyla's
a registered nurse there.

103
00:07:17.698 --> 00:07:18.916
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

104
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.396
I help people now. Annie.

105
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.311
That's more than
you can say for yourself.

106
00:07:22.354 --> 00:07:24.444
Yeah. super mature. Leyla.

107
00:07:24.487 --> 00:07:25.923
So what?

108
00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:28.622
You two are big city girl.
career girls now?

109
00:07:28.665 --> 00:07:30.624
Is that what's going on?
You forgot where you came from?

110
00:07:32.277 --> 00:07:34.454
Beats sitting around
the same dusty old shop

111
00:07:34.497 --> 00:07:37.500
15 years later with no future.

112
00:07:38.153 --> 00:07:40.721
You will probably die
at that counter one day.

113
00:07:40.764 --> 00:07:42.723
- Leyla.
- No. it's okay. Jen.

114
00:07:42.766 --> 00:07:44.464
Let's let the has-been talk.

115
00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:46.857
Same old story.
She peaked in high school.

116
00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:48.468
We know she's never gonna
amount to anything.

117
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.819
- I've amounted plenty.
- Yeah.

118
00:07:53.385 --> 00:07:55.344
You know what?
You break it. you buy it.

119
00:07:55.387 --> 00:07:56.911
- Hey.
- You got it?

120
00:07:56.954 --> 00:07:58.521
Is that little Annie Eastman?

121
00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:00.001
Oh. dude!

122
00:08:00.044 --> 00:08:01.872
Oh. shit.

123
00:08:01.916 --> 00:08:03.526
Oh. for fuck's sake.

124
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.485
Bert. you clumsy oaf.

125
00:08:06.268 --> 00:08:07.617
You will have to buy it.

126
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:09.358
since you probably broke it.

127
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:10.794
Isn't that right. Annie?

128
00:08:11.752 --> 00:08:14.929
$1.000? For this?

129
00:08:14.972 --> 00:08:16.583
You've got to be joking.

130
00:08:16.626 --> 00:08:18.672
It's never been opened.
You clearly damaged it.

131
00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:21.326
It's just a little scratch.
Maybe I could un-scratch it.

132
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.545
No!

133
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:23.633
No.

134
00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.593
Pay up first.

135
00:08:26.636 --> 00:08:29.552
I'm sorry.
I only have $200.

136
00:08:29.596 --> 00:08:30.988
I don't have 1.000.

137
00:08:31.032 --> 00:08:33.121
For God's sake. Bert.

138
00:08:33.164 --> 00:08:35.079
Don't apologize to her.

139
00:08:35.123 --> 00:08:37.081
That's probably
how she makes all her money

140
00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:39.519
out of this dustbin.

141
00:08:39.562 --> 00:08:43.000
Scams putting unsuspecting
travelers out of their money.

142
00:08:43.566 --> 00:08:46.569
No one would actually buy
anything from this dump.

143
00:08:47.396 --> 00:08:48.484
What?

144
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.833
You know what. Bert?

145
00:08:49.877 --> 00:08:51.966
$200 actually
sounds pretty good.

146
00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:54.838
I'm serious. $200.

147
00:08:54.882 --> 00:08:56.318
You can take
the damn thing with you.

148
00:08:57.188 --> 00:08:58.581
It gives me the creeps anyway.

149
00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:00.670
But you said
it's one of a kind.

150
00:09:00.714 --> 00:09:03.194
and I wouldn't even know
what to do with it.

151
00:09:03.238 --> 00:09:04.674
Well. you know.
it's fine. it's just--

152
00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:05.893
Annie. be smart. girl.

153
00:09:07.634 --> 00:09:09.505
It's okay. Papa.
I got this.

154
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.854
I got this. it's fine.

155
00:09:12.377 --> 00:09:14.728
Seriously. Bert. $200 is fine.
We'll be right as rain.

156
00:09:14.771 --> 00:09:18.340
Again. I'm really sorry.

157
00:09:19.646 --> 00:09:21.430
Thanks for letting me off
for only 200.

158
00:09:21.473 --> 00:09:24.868
So. uh. Annie. you have
any newcomers around here?

159
00:09:24.912 --> 00:09:27.218
Or is it just as quiet
as when we were kids?

160
00:09:27.262 --> 00:09:30.570
Not too long ago. a family
bought the old Cutter farm.

161
00:09:31.614 --> 00:09:33.094
But they didn't last very long.

162
00:09:33.137 --> 00:09:34.878
They left pretty quickly
after they realized

163
00:09:34.922 --> 00:09:36.358
the land wasn't worth anything

164
00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:37.620
and they couldn't grow
anything on it.

165
00:09:37.664 --> 00:09:39.579
That creepy piece of land?

166
00:09:39.622 --> 00:09:41.450
Isn't it haunted by some curse?

167
00:09:41.493 --> 00:09:44.018
It was tainted by
a bunch of Satan worshipers.

168
00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:46.063
People still see
the carvings in the trees.

169
00:09:47.151 --> 00:09:48.892
No. the Cutters
were a bunch of idiots

170
00:09:48.936 --> 00:09:50.807
who couldn't take care
of their land.

171
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:52.243
Now look at it.

172
00:09:52.287 --> 00:09:53.680
Cows can't even graze on it.

173
00:09:55.769 --> 00:09:57.684
Well. if that's everything.

174
00:09:57.727 --> 00:09:59.729
now feel free to get
the fuck out of my shop.

175
00:10:01.905 --> 00:10:04.212
Nothing would make me happier.

176
00:10:04.255 --> 00:10:05.648
- Oh. I'm sure. honey.
- What?

177
00:10:07.128 --> 00:10:08.346
Are you going
to the reunion. Annie?

178
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.826
That's why we're all back.

179
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.132
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

180
00:10:12.002 --> 00:10:13.090
Okay.

181
00:10:23.884 --> 00:10:26.451
Well. what's in it?

182
00:10:26.495 --> 00:10:27.627
- I don't know.
- Open it up!

183
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:28.932
It's never been opened before.

184
00:10:28.976 --> 00:10:30.151
Well. then fuckin'
open it. bud.

185
00:10:30.194 --> 00:10:31.326
Open up.

186
00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:34.851
Come on. big money.

187
00:10:36.461 --> 00:10:39.813
Oh. this is rubbish!

188
00:10:41.249 --> 00:10:43.120
200 bucks for a fucking bear?

189
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.340
Way to go.
What a waste of money.

190
00:10:45.383 --> 00:10:46.863
I'll tell you
what a waste of money is.

191
00:10:46.907 --> 00:10:48.735
that new wave medicine
that nobody wants.

192
00:10:50.171 --> 00:10:51.651
Fuck you. inbreed.

193
00:10:51.694 --> 00:10:54.392
Cory. hey. rude.
Apologize to Bert right now.

194
00:10:54.436 --> 00:10:55.916
No. it's okay. Jen.

195
00:10:55.959 --> 00:10:57.657
That's the best
that Cory can come up with

196
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.094
since he's basically
special needs anyway.

197
00:11:00.137 --> 00:11:01.573
Isn't that right. Gory Cory?

198
00:11:01.617 --> 00:11:03.227
I told you
not to fucking call me that.

199
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:04.576
- Hey. enough. Enough.
- Hey. hey.

200
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.056
- Come on. guys.
- Stop. Enough.

201
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.058
Come on. Calm down.

202
00:11:08.102 --> 00:11:09.494
We came here
to have a good time.

203
00:11:09.538 --> 00:11:10.974
and that's what
we're going to do.

204
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.282
This is too much drama for me.

205
00:11:14.325 --> 00:11:15.979
That's calling
the kettle black. Leyla.

206
00:11:16.763 --> 00:11:19.983
Sure. Aaron.
I'll chill.

207
00:11:20.027 --> 00:11:21.724
Let's go.

208
00:11:21.768 --> 00:11:23.334
But you better watch
those comments of yours. Cory.

209
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:26.555
Come on. bro.
All right?

210
00:11:29.819 --> 00:11:31.386
Hey. you're going too fast.

211
00:11:31.429 --> 00:11:33.823
Hey. backseat driver. zip it.

212
00:11:33.867 --> 00:11:36.173
Oh. fuck.

213
00:11:36.217 --> 00:11:37.697
Way to fucking go. bro.

214
00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:46.793
Hey. Gibson.
Go around the back.

215
00:11:46.836 --> 00:11:47.924
10-4.

216
00:11:54.452 --> 00:11:55.889
I got this. guys.

217
00:11:59.936 --> 00:12:01.372
Yes. Officer?

218
00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:04.071
Uh. I'm not an officer.
I'm a sheriff.

219
00:12:04.114 --> 00:12:06.769
- Oh. my bad.
- There's a big difference.

220
00:12:07.683 --> 00:12:11.165
Anyway. you have any idea
how fast you were going?

221
00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:12.862
Uh. no. sir.

222
00:12:14.298 --> 00:12:16.431
- Was I speeding?
- Oh. yeah.

223
00:12:16.474 --> 00:12:21.001
We're 25 'round here.
we clocked you at about 53.

224
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.222
Yeah. you were going
kind of fast there. pal.

225
00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:28.138
Uh. you might hit somebody.
hurt somebody.

226
00:12:32.012 --> 00:12:33.883
Gimme your driver's license
and registration.

227
00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:37.408
And IDs from everybody
in this car.

228
00:12:37.452 --> 00:12:39.019
We didn't do anything wrong.

229
00:12:39.062 --> 00:12:40.760
Why have you stopped us?

230
00:12:40.803 --> 00:12:42.283
I didn't ask you anything
so you shouldn't talk to me.

231
00:12:43.414 --> 00:12:44.502
Okay.

232
00:12:47.897 --> 00:12:49.420
- There you go. Sheriff.
- All right.

233
00:12:50.857 --> 00:12:51.945
I got it.

234
00:12:54.686 --> 00:12:55.949
Fucking prick.

235
00:12:55.992 --> 00:12:57.907
Hey. long time no see. Leyla.

236
00:12:57.951 --> 00:12:59.474
Hi. Danny. How are you?

237
00:12:59.517 --> 00:13:00.823
- I'm doing good.
- Long time. man.

238
00:13:00.867 --> 00:13:02.520
Yeah. how y'all doing?

239
00:13:02.564 --> 00:13:04.392
Y'all in town
for the reunion. I assume?

240
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.180
Okay. listen. I'll let you go

241
00:13:10.224 --> 00:13:11.573
with a warning
this time. all right?

242
00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:12.704
- Okay.
- Thank you. Sheriff.

243
00:13:12.748 --> 00:13:14.097
Sure. sure. sure.

244
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:15.055
Just slow down
next time. would you?

245
00:13:15.098 --> 00:13:16.839
Yes. sir. My bad.

246
00:13:16.883 --> 00:13:18.275
You guys have
a good afternoon. all right?

247
00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:19.494
All right. you too. Sheriff.

248
00:13:19.537 --> 00:13:20.712
Thank you. Your Honor.

249
00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:33.377
- Here we go.
- Okay. let's see.

250
00:13:33.421 --> 00:13:35.553
Welcome to my humble house!

251
00:13:35.597 --> 00:13:37.729
- God.
- Go. Bert.

252
00:13:37.773 --> 00:13:41.037
I'm carrying a lot of shit.
guys. come on.

253
00:13:44.475 --> 00:13:46.216
Unbelievable.

254
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.305
Those motherfuckers
were supposed to remodel

255
00:13:48.349 --> 00:13:50.699
this entire house
before we got here.

256
00:13:51.918 --> 00:13:53.310
- Leyla.
- What?

257
00:13:53.354 --> 00:13:55.530
- It's fine.
- You're kidding me. right?

258
00:13:55.573 --> 00:13:57.488
It's-- it's got some--

259
00:13:57.532 --> 00:13:58.838
it's got some character.

260
00:13:58.881 --> 00:14:00.317
Yeah. Leyla.

261
00:14:00.361 --> 00:14:03.059
It's a-- it's a really
manly man's place.

262
00:14:03.103 --> 00:14:05.670
Real butch. Hoorah.

263
00:14:05.714 --> 00:14:07.063
Fuck off. okay?

264
00:14:09.065 --> 00:14:12.025
So that means it's time to go
back to Austin. right. guys?

265
00:14:12.068 --> 00:14:13.722
You're not helping. Okay?

266
00:14:13.765 --> 00:14:15.942
I'm kidding. Leyla.
It's fine!

267
00:14:15.985 --> 00:14:18.596
- It's a mess.
- The place is fine.

268
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.555
It's only for a couple of days.

269
00:14:20.598 --> 00:14:21.991
Sure.

270
00:14:25.342 --> 00:14:27.214
- Leyla.
- What?

271
00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:29.651
It's a nice place.

272
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.958
Come on. sweetheart.

273
00:14:32.001 --> 00:14:33.133
Yeah. just-- just go ahead.

274
00:14:33.176 --> 00:14:34.264
Let's go find our room.

275
00:14:35.135 --> 00:14:36.223
Just go ahead.

276
00:14:38.312 --> 00:14:39.704
So. uh...

277
00:14:40.923 --> 00:14:42.142
where's our room?

278
00:14:42.185 --> 00:14:43.273
Back off. Cory.

279
00:14:43.317 --> 00:14:44.971
Back off. okay?

280
00:14:45.014 --> 00:14:46.407
It's ladies only.

281
00:14:48.452 --> 00:14:50.280
Well. hey. Bert.
you're invited. then.

282
00:14:52.979 --> 00:14:54.023
Hey. uh. Leyla.

283
00:14:54.719 --> 00:14:55.982
Where do you want your shit?

284
00:14:56.025 --> 00:14:57.113
Just leave it there. okay?

285
00:14:57.592 --> 00:14:58.941
I'm not in the mood right now.

286
00:14:58.985 --> 00:15:00.073
Thank you.

287
00:15:00.638 --> 00:15:02.162
You're welcome. your Majesty.

288
00:15:02.945 --> 00:15:03.990
Oh. hey.

289
00:15:05.556 --> 00:15:07.210
Fuck you.

290
00:16:09.055 --> 00:16:10.099
Come on.

291
00:16:11.231 --> 00:16:12.319
Any luck. Bert?

292
00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:15.975
Not much today. but I'm--
I'm still hopeful.

293
00:16:16.845 --> 00:16:18.151
Damn.

294
00:16:18.194 --> 00:16:19.935
So. Aaron.
it's been a while. man.

295
00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:21.458
When are you gonna
finally propose?

296
00:16:22.242 --> 00:16:24.461
It's all in the timing. my guy.

297
00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:28.335
Besides.
I'm not gonna drop any hints

298
00:16:28.378 --> 00:16:31.294
with the biggest gossip
since high school around.

299
00:16:31.338 --> 00:16:33.557
Do you really think
I don't have the self-control

300
00:16:33.601 --> 00:16:35.472
- to hide it from Jennifer?
- No.

301
00:16:35.516 --> 00:16:37.822
Well. you did tell us
about Cory's penis.

302
00:16:37.866 --> 00:16:39.476
- What?
- What'd you say?

303
00:16:40.086 --> 00:16:42.914
I did not!
Tell him you're lying.

304
00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.655
She said it was cute.

305
00:16:44.699 --> 00:16:47.136
Similar to how a sorority girl
reacts to a Chihuahua.

306
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.921
Fucking end you. bud.

307
00:16:49.965 --> 00:16:52.272
Oh. good one. Gory Cory.

308
00:16:53.403 --> 00:16:54.752
Hey. come on. guys.

309
00:16:55.623 --> 00:16:58.104
Damn. can't y'all get along
just for one weekend?

310
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.020
And after that. you don't have
to see each other ever again.

311
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.761
Just calm down.

312
00:17:04.327 --> 00:17:05.372
Okay. boys.

313
00:17:06.721 --> 00:17:09.898
Let Aaron have his practice
kissing the bride.

314
00:17:10.942 --> 00:17:12.466
- Leyla.
- What?

315
00:17:12.509 --> 00:17:13.597
I'm not proposing.

316
00:17:14.381 --> 00:17:16.557
Not yet. Johnson.

317
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.473
And you. sir. messed up my tan.

318
00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:21.127
Let's go.

319
00:17:22.998 --> 00:17:24.434
Give them space.

320
00:17:25.435 --> 00:17:26.523
It's still funny.

321
00:17:57.989 --> 00:17:59.426
Oh. Jesus.

322
00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.058
You all right?

323
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.974
Are you gonna help a lady up?

324
00:18:28.803 --> 00:18:29.934
Certainly.

325
00:18:31.022 --> 00:18:32.111
Come here.

326
00:18:34.852 --> 00:18:35.940
There you go.

327
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.378
Well. thank you.

328
00:18:41.381 --> 00:18:44.035
What are you doing honking at
somebody jogging down the road?

329
00:18:45.646 --> 00:18:47.561
Well. I'm sorry.
'cause. uh...

330
00:18:48.605 --> 00:18:49.780
I wasn't trying to scare you.

331
00:18:50.564 --> 00:18:52.218
- Really?
- Yeah. really.

332
00:18:52.261 --> 00:18:53.654
I just--
I recognized you.

333
00:18:53.697 --> 00:18:55.395
I haven't seen you
in a while.

334
00:18:55.438 --> 00:18:56.744
Yeah. it's been a minute.

335
00:18:56.787 --> 00:18:58.485
It's been a very long minute.

336
00:19:00.617 --> 00:19:01.792
So what do you want?

337
00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:05.579
- I wanna make sure you're okay.
- I'm fine.

338
00:19:05.622 --> 00:19:07.929
I'm running between
two fields in the daylight.

339
00:19:08.364 --> 00:19:09.452
Yeah. well...

340
00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:12.325
crazy things can happen
in the daylight.

341
00:19:12.847 --> 00:19:13.935
That's true.

342
00:19:15.502 --> 00:19:19.114
Um. listen.
you know. if you're...

343
00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:21.725
I could turn them lights on...

344
00:19:22.552 --> 00:19:26.121
and give you a mobile escort.
wherever you're going.

345
00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:27.905
I'm pretty sure
I know the way home.

346
00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:29.429
Yeah. I guess you do.

347
00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:33.911
If you're hurt
when you fell down.

348
00:19:33.955 --> 00:19:35.435
I'll put you in
and give you a ride.

349
00:19:35.478 --> 00:19:37.872
Well. luckily for me.
I'm perfectly good.

350
00:19:38.699 --> 00:19:40.701
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

351
00:19:40.744 --> 00:19:42.006
Yeah. I can see that.

352
00:19:43.791 --> 00:19:45.793
Well. you know what?
You know where I'm at.

353
00:19:46.272 --> 00:19:47.621
- Yeah. I do.
- Sheriff.

354
00:19:48.839 --> 00:19:49.927
I see that.

355
00:19:51.668 --> 00:19:53.627
Maybe one day
you'll stop by and...

356
00:19:55.019 --> 00:19:56.760
chase each other
around the room again.

357
00:20:04.246 --> 00:20:05.378
Not tonight.

358
00:20:15.257 --> 00:20:17.781
I guess that means maybe
tomorrow is a possibility?

359
00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:25.311
See you later. honey.

360
00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:41.022
So. how do you feel
about being back home?

361
00:20:41.762 --> 00:20:43.111
It's fine. I guess.

362
00:20:43.154 --> 00:20:45.766
I don't know. Aaron.

363
00:20:45.809 --> 00:20:46.897
I just--

364
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.683
coming back to Junction
brings back good memories.

365
00:20:49.726 --> 00:20:51.554
but I never liked it here.

366
00:20:52.076 --> 00:20:53.687
I just feel like
I shouldn't be here.

367
00:20:55.297 --> 00:20:56.733
Babe. that's normal.

368
00:20:57.865 --> 00:20:59.823
I mean. I feel weird
about this place. too.

369
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:02.957
It's strange. after all these
years. it's still the same.

370
00:21:04.437 --> 00:21:06.569
I was always anxious
in Junction.

371
00:21:06.613 --> 00:21:08.745
My anxiety came back
as soon as we got here.

372
00:21:10.878 --> 00:21:13.272
Come on. babe.
Let's go enjoy the sunshine.

373
00:21:13.315 --> 00:21:14.403
Uh. no.

374
00:21:15.752 --> 00:21:17.493
I'd burn so fast.
I'd look like Freddy Krueger.

375
00:21:17.537 --> 00:21:18.625
And?

376
00:21:19.234 --> 00:21:20.496
I like me some Freddy Krueger.

377
00:21:21.584 --> 00:21:22.672
I'd still love you.

378
00:21:25.414 --> 00:21:27.329
In fact.
I still remember that one year

379
00:21:27.373 --> 00:21:29.418
where you had
that godawful acne.

380
00:21:30.201 --> 00:21:32.900
Wow.

381
00:21:32.943 --> 00:21:35.642
You know. you always say
the sweetest things to me.

382
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:37.383
Gross.

383
00:21:56.402 --> 00:21:58.055
Babe. I have
a question to ask you.

384
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.844
I've been thinking
a lot about us lately.

385
00:22:04.584 --> 00:22:06.020
How time is fleeting...

386
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.589
and spending time
with the people you love

387
00:22:09.632 --> 00:22:10.851
is what life is all about.

388
00:22:12.896 --> 00:22:15.377
I know we've had
our shares of ups and downs.

389
00:22:16.552 --> 00:22:19.207
But we've always managed to
continue to love each other...

390
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.818
be there for each other.

391
00:22:24.734 --> 00:22:27.084
When I look into
those beautiful green eyes...

392
00:22:27.868 --> 00:22:29.217
and that smile of yours...

393
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:32.046
I just think...

394
00:22:33.613 --> 00:22:36.529
You're the most beautiful.
amazing woman I've ever seen.

395
00:22:37.921 --> 00:22:39.445
And how I'm the luckiest man
in the world.

396
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.057
You're my best friend.
I love you.

397
00:22:43.753 --> 00:22:45.538
You'll always be
my best friend.

398
00:22:51.935 --> 00:22:54.721
Jennifer Anne Corolla.

399
00:22:56.462 --> 00:22:57.506
Will you marry me?

400
00:23:03.033 --> 00:23:05.819
Yes.
Oh. my God. Aaron. yes.

401
00:23:31.584 --> 00:23:32.976
A deer and. like.
a rabbit once--

402
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.630
What are you talking about?

403
00:23:34.674 --> 00:23:36.023
And even the math
teacher back in high school.

404
00:23:36.066 --> 00:23:37.590
Rubbish! Rubbish!

405
00:23:37.633 --> 00:23:39.809
Hey. hey. there she is!
It's Aaron Johnson.

406
00:23:39.853 --> 00:23:41.507
- What's your name?
- Shut up.

407
00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.596
My new sister-in-law!

408
00:23:44.553 --> 00:23:46.076
- Show me the ring.
- Yeah.

409
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.819
- Look at that thing!
- That's beautiful.

410
00:23:49.863 --> 00:23:51.517
Hey. I want a picture.
I want a picture.

411
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.909
- Picture.
- Oh. wait. Um...

412
00:23:52.953 --> 00:23:54.128
I'm just gonna go
freshen up really quick.

413
00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:55.651
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

414
00:23:55.695 --> 00:23:57.784
- All right. Cheers.
- Why does she hate me?

415
00:24:31.644 --> 00:24:33.428
Mrs. Jennifer Johnson.

416
00:24:35.517 --> 00:24:37.737
Mrs. Jennifer Corolla-Johnson.

417
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:45.179
What the fuck?

418
00:24:47.268 --> 00:24:49.662
Hey. babe. you okay in there?

419
00:24:49.705 --> 00:24:51.794
Oh. yeah-- yeah. baby.

420
00:24:51.838 --> 00:24:54.623
I. uh. knocked
a shampoo bottle off the shelf.

421
00:24:55.363 --> 00:24:56.495
Okay.

422
00:24:56.973 --> 00:24:59.672
Gotta make sure
my fiancée is okay.

423
00:25:00.803 --> 00:25:01.978
I'm going back to the party.

424
00:25:02.588 --> 00:25:03.719
I'll be right out. baby.

425
00:25:41.104 --> 00:25:42.236
Hey. buddy.

426
00:25:43.063 --> 00:25:44.151
You need a tan?

427
00:25:45.631 --> 00:25:46.719
All right.

428
00:25:51.158 --> 00:25:52.420
Morning.

429
00:25:52.463 --> 00:25:53.856
Come on down to Dan the Tan.

430
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.205
where I'm killing
the competition.

431
00:25:56.772 --> 00:25:58.774
You peak in high school?
I sure didn't.

432
00:25:58.818 --> 00:26:00.297
Come on down to Dan the Tan.

433
00:26:00.341 --> 00:26:02.038
I'll give you
a little glow up.

434
00:26:02.082 --> 00:26:03.866
I'll make you tan. I'll make
you happy. I'll make you sexy.

435
00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:04.824
For less!

436
00:26:09.393 --> 00:26:11.395
Bert. look out!

437
00:26:13.267 --> 00:26:15.486
- Holy shit.
- What the hell?

438
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:16.966
- Fuck.
- Holy shit.

439
00:26:17.706 --> 00:26:19.229
Thanks. Jen.

440
00:26:19.273 --> 00:26:21.580
- Aw. bud. it missed you.
- Oh. stop it.

441
00:26:21.623 --> 00:26:23.973
Too early for it. Cory.
Muzzle it.

442
00:26:24.017 --> 00:26:26.062
Why do all these weird things
keep happening?

443
00:26:26.106 --> 00:26:27.586
The cabin is out to get us.

444
00:26:28.456 --> 00:26:29.762
I wouldn't
worry about it. babe.

445
00:26:29.805 --> 00:26:31.285
Just have some
cold pizza with me.

446
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.548
We got a long day anyways.

447
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.159
Hey. so. ladies.
Aaron and I are going to go

448
00:26:36.203 --> 00:26:38.031
on a hike up
to Mile's old house.

449
00:26:38.074 --> 00:26:39.162
You want to join?

450
00:26:40.424 --> 00:26:41.991
- Bert. you're welcome. too.
- Pass.

451
00:26:42.035 --> 00:26:43.602
I'm meeting John
over at Isaac's

452
00:26:43.645 --> 00:26:44.820
for lunch this afternoon.

453
00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.127
We have a lot of
catching up to do.

454
00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:48.650
Oh. that's good.

455
00:26:48.694 --> 00:26:50.130
Is that tanning salon
we passed in town?

456
00:26:53.786 --> 00:26:55.657
Will you come
with me later. Jennifer?

457
00:26:55.701 --> 00:26:56.832
Please.

458
00:26:56.876 --> 00:26:58.660
Of course. it'll be fun.

459
00:27:00.488 --> 00:27:03.578
All right. so. it looks like
we meet back here at 5:00

460
00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:05.580
and get ready for the reunion.

461
00:27:06.015 --> 00:27:08.061
You know. I can't wait to see

462
00:27:08.104 --> 00:27:10.629
the look on those
sad Junction girls faces

463
00:27:10.672 --> 00:27:12.282
when we stroll into the party.

464
00:27:12.326 --> 00:27:14.763
We will knock them dead.

465
00:27:14.807 --> 00:27:16.939
This will be
a night to remember.

466
00:27:16.983 --> 00:27:18.506
Oh. yes!

467
00:27:20.769 --> 00:27:22.684
- For some of us.
- I need more pizza.

468
00:27:27.297 --> 00:27:28.995
I don't know
why you won't let me

469
00:27:29.038 --> 00:27:30.518
just go over there and knock
his fucking lights out.

470
00:27:30.561 --> 00:27:33.042
Because A.
I can take care of myself.

471
00:27:33.086 --> 00:27:35.262
B. I don't want you go to jail.

472
00:27:35.305 --> 00:27:37.830
and C. you're not
my boyfriend anymore.

473
00:27:39.048 --> 00:27:41.355
Fuck. why do you have to be
so fucking stubborn?

474
00:27:41.398 --> 00:27:42.878
Get used to it!

475
00:27:42.922 --> 00:27:45.011
Do you hear Cory
yelling at Leyla like that?

476
00:27:45.054 --> 00:27:46.447
- Fuck!
- Damn.

477
00:27:47.317 --> 00:27:49.580
Yeah. I think he's just
concerned. that's all.

478
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.453
He still cares about her.

479
00:27:52.496 --> 00:27:53.802
Well. they'd still be together

480
00:27:53.846 --> 00:27:55.499
if he wasn't
such a dick all the time.

481
00:27:56.239 --> 00:27:57.327
He's getting better.

482
00:27:59.112 --> 00:28:00.679
- What the hell?
- What the fuck?

483
00:28:06.554 --> 00:28:08.034
Oh. God.

484
00:28:08.077 --> 00:28:09.644
What a mess.

485
00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:11.820
Look at all that broken glass.

486
00:28:11.864 --> 00:28:12.995
Who broke that?

487
00:28:13.953 --> 00:28:15.302
Wait. nobody was even in here.

488
00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:17.086
Nobody but the...

489
00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:19.828
Fucking A. Bert.

490
00:28:19.872 --> 00:28:21.612
I swear to God. dude.

491
00:28:21.656 --> 00:28:23.484
if this is another one
of your stupid pranks--

492
00:28:23.527 --> 00:28:25.094
It wasn't me. all right?

493
00:28:25.138 --> 00:28:26.661
It wasn't me
the last time either.

494
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.445
I was in the bathroom
getting ready.

495
00:28:28.489 --> 00:28:30.534
Cory must have left the bottle
on the edge of the table.

496
00:28:30.578 --> 00:28:32.275
- It just finally slipped.
- No. fuck you.

497
00:28:32.319 --> 00:28:33.799
I put it in the center
of the table.

498
00:28:33.842 --> 00:28:35.191
and the bear
wasn't fucking there.

499
00:28:35.235 --> 00:28:37.672
Stop arguing about this.

500
00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:39.718
It's just some freak accident.

501
00:28:40.196 --> 00:28:42.503
Okay. No harm. no foul.

502
00:28:42.546 --> 00:28:44.287
Whatever happened. happened.

503
00:28:45.245 --> 00:28:47.029
Everybody just get back
to doing what you were doing.

504
00:28:49.118 --> 00:28:52.078
Oh. yeah. just mosey on
back to your room.

505
00:28:52.121 --> 00:28:53.775
Never mind
that my fucking expensive vodka

506
00:28:53.819 --> 00:28:54.863
is all over the floor.

507
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:59.172
You clean it up. Cory.
You have time.

508
00:28:59.825 --> 00:29:02.566
No matter how much time
you spend primping.

509
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.699
it doesn't change
this ugly face.

510
00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:07.093
Oh. that's a good one.
That's a good one.

511
00:29:07.136 --> 00:29:08.311
Just...

512
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.749
You fucking do it.

513
00:29:20.019 --> 00:29:23.457
Yeah.

514
00:29:45.914 --> 00:29:47.394
Hey. Annie.

515
00:29:47.437 --> 00:29:49.265
Oh. God.
I can't get rid of you guys.

516
00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:52.181
That's a nice sparkly dress
you're wearing.

517
00:29:52.225 --> 00:29:53.313
Hey. girl.

518
00:29:53.356 --> 00:29:55.184
I'm sorry. I mean. Annie.

519
00:29:55.228 --> 00:29:56.882
Old habits.

520
00:29:56.925 --> 00:29:58.448
Oh. I can see the douche canoe
has arrived as well.

521
00:29:59.667 --> 00:30:00.799
What do you want?

522
00:30:00.842 --> 00:30:02.365
Look. I don't want to keep you.

523
00:30:02.409 --> 00:30:03.802
We're all going
to the same party in a few.

524
00:30:03.845 --> 00:30:05.368
I just need
to ask you a question.

525
00:30:06.456 --> 00:30:08.545
So ask.
I don't have all night.

526
00:30:09.155 --> 00:30:10.547
I gotta go meet with my girls.

527
00:30:10.591 --> 00:30:12.201
Is the cheerleading
squad still here?

528
00:30:12.245 --> 00:30:15.291
Annie. that box
that you sold us?

529
00:30:15.335 --> 00:30:17.250
There was-- there was
a teddy bear inside of it

530
00:30:17.293 --> 00:30:19.600
and I was just wondering
if you knew where it came from.

531
00:30:19.643 --> 00:30:21.689
Why? What does it matter?

532
00:30:21.732 --> 00:30:23.473
Look. I don't give two shits
about the damn thing.

533
00:30:23.517 --> 00:30:24.910
You guys own it.

534
00:30:24.953 --> 00:30:26.650
Why are you asking
about the damn bear?

535
00:30:26.694 --> 00:30:28.261
We've been having some
very strange things happen.

536
00:30:28.304 --> 00:30:30.480
and I think it's connected
to the box somehow.

537
00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.832
Where did it come from?
Do you know where you got it?

538
00:30:33.875 --> 00:30:36.269
Fine. I'll tell you
who sold it to my granddad.

539
00:30:37.183 --> 00:30:38.967
For a price.

540
00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:41.013
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

541
00:30:41.056 --> 00:30:42.623
Gosh. you're
a real piece of work.

542
00:30:42.666 --> 00:30:44.320
You know. I'm so glad
we never stayed together.

543
00:30:44.364 --> 00:30:46.235
Oh. God. that makes
two of us there. Gory Cory.

544
00:30:46.279 --> 00:30:47.846
Matter of fact.
you and that bitch Leyla

545
00:30:47.889 --> 00:30:49.412
deserve one another.

546
00:30:49.456 --> 00:30:51.240
- Or deserved one another.
- How much?

547
00:30:51.284 --> 00:30:52.763
How much do you want?

548
00:30:52.807 --> 00:30:55.070
Well. if it's
that important to you

549
00:30:55.114 --> 00:30:56.855
and you're cutting
into the one night

550
00:30:56.898 --> 00:30:58.595
that I actually have
a babysitter...

551
00:30:58.639 --> 00:31:00.467
...it's 100 bucks.

552
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.991
What?
I don't have any cash on me.

553
00:31:03.035 --> 00:31:04.775
- I can't help you.
- I can go ask Leyla--

554
00:31:04.819 --> 00:31:07.430
No. don't do that. I got it.

555
00:31:07.474 --> 00:31:08.692
Thank you.

556
00:31:09.432 --> 00:31:10.912
You are most accommodating.

557
00:31:11.434 --> 00:31:12.827
Here's your damn money.

558
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:14.394
Sweet.

559
00:31:17.484 --> 00:31:20.400
Here. the guy's name
is Jim Ravenfeather.

560
00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:22.315
He lives on
the other side of town.

561
00:31:22.358 --> 00:31:23.925
He was the original owner.

562
00:31:23.969 --> 00:31:25.318
You're welcome to go bug him
about the bear.

563
00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:26.885
Doubt he'll be
much help. though.

564
00:31:26.928 --> 00:31:28.843
- Thanks. Annie. Appreciate it.
- Of course.

565
00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:30.062
See you at the reunion.

566
00:31:30.105 --> 00:31:31.324
- Yeah.
- You know what?

567
00:31:32.499 --> 00:31:34.327
Don't even bother
talking to me at the school.

568
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:35.981
Know what?
Get the fuck out of here.

569
00:31:36.024 --> 00:31:37.634
And don't worry. I won't.

570
00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:41.943
God damn it.

571
00:31:44.511 --> 00:31:46.774
God damn door.

572
00:31:47.601 --> 00:31:49.342
I can't believe those guys.

573
00:31:49.864 --> 00:31:51.344
Fucking assholes just think

574
00:31:51.387 --> 00:31:52.867
they're so much better
than everybody else

575
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:54.477
just because
they moved to the big city.

576
00:31:54.521 --> 00:31:55.783
moved away from here.

577
00:31:56.305 --> 00:31:58.307
What am I here for?

578
00:31:59.091 --> 00:32:00.570
My phone. Yes.

579
00:32:01.267 --> 00:32:05.924
Okay. it's all right.

580
00:32:06.489 --> 00:32:07.795
It's all right.

581
00:32:07.838 --> 00:32:09.884
It's okay. Just breathe.

582
00:32:13.409 --> 00:32:14.628
We still got it. girl.

583
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:23.680
Hello?

584
00:32:24.681 --> 00:32:27.336
Is someone there?

585
00:32:32.211 --> 00:32:33.299
Hello?

586
00:32:34.865 --> 00:32:35.997
Is there anybody there?

587
00:32:38.782 --> 00:32:39.870
Dad?

588
00:32:44.049 --> 00:32:45.398
Someone there?

589
00:32:50.838 --> 00:32:51.970
Daddy?

590
00:32:53.754 --> 00:32:54.842
Hello?

591
00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.065
Who's there?

592
00:33:03.764 --> 00:33:05.070
Hello?

593
00:33:13.992 --> 00:33:16.255
About to go Jamie Lee Curtis
on this motherfucker.

594
00:33:17.082 --> 00:33:18.213
Hello?

595
00:33:21.173 --> 00:33:22.391
Is there anyone down here?

596
00:33:26.439 --> 00:33:29.355
Hello?

597
00:33:35.926 --> 00:33:37.015
Hello?

598
00:33:40.975 --> 00:33:42.063
Who are you?

599
00:33:52.595 --> 00:33:54.032
Oh. shit.

600
00:33:54.771 --> 00:33:57.078
Oh. God.

601
00:33:57.122 --> 00:33:59.341
Oh. All right. We're good.

602
00:33:59.385 --> 00:34:00.603
Get it together. Annie.

603
00:34:08.002 --> 00:34:10.483
Ah!

604
00:34:43.994 --> 00:34:46.388
Damn it.
Fuck Jamie Lee Curtis.

605
00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:56.920
Well. you bet.

606
00:34:56.964 --> 00:34:59.009
Well. at least one of us
is having a good time.

607
00:35:01.577 --> 00:35:02.839
Yeah. it does not surprise me

608
00:35:02.883 --> 00:35:04.232
that the inbreed
and the toffee kid

609
00:35:04.276 --> 00:35:05.712
are the only ones
enjoying themselves.

610
00:35:05.755 --> 00:35:07.235
- Oh. come on. Cory.
- Yeah.

611
00:35:07.279 --> 00:35:08.584
Just be happy for 'em.

612
00:35:09.107 --> 00:35:12.458
Hey. sourpusses.
Why the long faces?

613
00:35:12.501 --> 00:35:14.024
It wasn't that bad.
right. John?

614
00:35:14.068 --> 00:35:15.591
Speak for yourself. Bert.

615
00:35:15.635 --> 00:35:17.463
God.
this town fucking sucks.

616
00:35:18.028 --> 00:35:21.510
- I'm never coming back here.
- Oh. I remember you.

617
00:35:21.554 --> 00:35:23.686
You were such a douche
in the school.

618
00:35:24.209 --> 00:35:26.602
That's why no one ever
wanted to party with you.

619
00:35:27.255 --> 00:35:29.388
Hey. John?
Fuck off. okay?

620
00:35:29.431 --> 00:35:31.216
At least I made it out
of this shit hole town.

621
00:35:31.259 --> 00:35:32.608
I made a name for myself

622
00:35:32.652 --> 00:35:35.089
outside of Junction.
fuckin' Texas.

623
00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:36.960
I'm in
a sports medicine company.

624
00:35:37.004 --> 00:35:39.789
and I was on Forbes'
Top 100 startup companies.

625
00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:41.443
Right. so that's
what's making you better

626
00:35:41.487 --> 00:35:42.792
than all of us. right. Cory?

627
00:35:42.836 --> 00:35:44.490
So why don't you tell us all

628
00:35:44.533 --> 00:35:47.188
how much money this Top 100
startup company made?

629
00:35:47.884 --> 00:35:49.712
Well. it's a startup company.
so the money comes--

630
00:35:49.756 --> 00:35:52.150
Exactly. $0.

631
00:35:52.193 --> 00:35:54.152
That's why Leyla
had to fund this whole trip.

632
00:35:54.195 --> 00:35:58.460
Because you are
dead B-R-O-K-E. broke.

633
00:35:58.504 --> 00:35:59.722
Right. Gory Cory?

634
00:36:00.854 --> 00:36:02.551
I told you not to fucking
call me that. okay?

635
00:36:02.595 --> 00:36:04.379
- Hey. stop it.
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.

636
00:36:04.423 --> 00:36:05.859
Hey. hey. hey.

637
00:36:05.902 --> 00:36:07.208
Bert. you okay?

638
00:36:07.252 --> 00:36:08.818
What's your fucking
problem. Cory?

639
00:36:08.862 --> 00:36:10.385
Motherfucker had
it coming. okay?

640
00:36:10.429 --> 00:36:11.691
- Just go.
- Get in the car now!

641
00:36:12.648 --> 00:36:15.085
- Let me see. let me see.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

642
00:36:15.738 --> 00:36:17.262
He packs a punch. though. Ow...

643
00:36:17.305 --> 00:36:19.220
Do you want to go
and see a doctor or something?

644
00:36:19.264 --> 00:36:21.309
- It might be broken.
- No. no. it's fine. it's fine.

645
00:36:21.353 --> 00:36:23.181
Nothing a nice.
cold beer couldn't fix.

646
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.444
Here comes
your shitty sense of humor.

647
00:36:25.487 --> 00:36:26.967
Come on.
let me buy you some beer.

648
00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.448
I told you not to come--

649
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:30.971
All right. you're right.

650
00:36:31.928 --> 00:36:35.018
Fuck it.
Hey. wait. I'm coming. too.

651
00:36:35.062 --> 00:36:38.326
I don't want to see that
sorry motherfucker right now.

652
00:36:39.501 --> 00:36:41.242
All right.
everyone. show's over.

653
00:36:41.286 --> 00:36:42.722
Go back to your lame ass party.

654
00:36:42.765 --> 00:36:44.071
Oh. my God. We're leaving.

655
00:36:44.114 --> 00:36:45.290
Fuck's going on. Aaron?

656
00:36:45.333 --> 00:36:46.943
Causing problems again?

657
00:36:46.987 --> 00:36:50.773
Oh. well.
late to the fun. Danny.

658
00:36:50.817 --> 00:36:53.515
Oh. I'm sorry. Deputy Gibson.

659
00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:55.561
Don't mind us.
We're leaving.

660
00:36:59.086 --> 00:37:00.305
Bunch of losers.

661
00:37:04.047 --> 00:37:05.440
Yes. ma'am.

662
00:37:10.532 --> 00:37:13.187
Okay. I'm on my way.

663
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:15.755
Hey. look. sorry.
Hot night with the Gibster?

664
00:37:15.798 --> 00:37:17.670
Gonna have to put that on hold.

665
00:37:17.713 --> 00:37:19.585
Duty calls. Ciao.

666
00:37:20.847 --> 00:37:22.501
You fucking prick.

667
00:37:23.545 --> 00:37:26.287
Okay. guys. you go ahead.

668
00:37:26.331 --> 00:37:27.636
See. I'm drunk.

669
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.464
Go ahead
and park the car over there.

670
00:37:29.508 --> 00:37:32.293
I'm gonna go inside and shower.

671
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.818
- That's my girl.
- Enjoy.

672
00:37:35.862 --> 00:37:37.298
You want us to come or no?

673
00:37:37.342 --> 00:37:39.648
No.

674
00:37:39.692 --> 00:37:40.780
See you in a bit.

675
00:37:42.042 --> 00:37:43.913
- She's a hoot.
- Yeah. she is.

676
00:37:43.957 --> 00:37:45.567
So amazing.

677
00:37:46.568 --> 00:37:48.004
Oh. man.

678
00:37:48.048 --> 00:37:49.484
Just careful-- It's like--

679
00:37:49.528 --> 00:37:51.269
I know.
this garage is like-

680
00:37:53.532 --> 00:37:55.229
All right. a little more?

681
00:37:55.664 --> 00:37:57.753
That's good enough.

682
00:37:57.797 --> 00:37:59.189
Man.

683
00:37:59.233 --> 00:38:01.017
So that's what
these cars are like. huh?

684
00:38:01.061 --> 00:38:02.628
I've always wanted
to drive one of these.

685
00:38:03.498 --> 00:38:07.459
Well. I was buzzed. so.
Thank you so much.

686
00:38:07.502 --> 00:38:08.634
No problem.

687
00:38:11.506 --> 00:38:13.073
What the hell
she meant by that?

688
00:38:13.595 --> 00:38:15.423
- What? Leyla?
- Mm-hmm.

689
00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:17.904
Who knows.
That girl's as ditzy as a bat.

690
00:38:17.947 --> 00:38:19.993
Well...

691
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.692
it was great
catching up with you.

692
00:38:23.736 --> 00:38:25.607
You too. John.

693
00:38:28.306 --> 00:38:31.483
To be honest. I was surprised
to see you with...

694
00:38:33.398 --> 00:38:35.225
Aaron and Cory earlier today.

695
00:38:35.922 --> 00:38:38.316
I never figured
you'd be part of their posse.

696
00:38:39.273 --> 00:38:40.361
I mean...

697
00:38:41.536 --> 00:38:43.843
they used to bully you
back in the days.

698
00:38:44.409 --> 00:38:46.672
And Cory still does.

699
00:38:47.673 --> 00:38:49.718
Yeah. Look...

700
00:38:49.762 --> 00:38:51.285
Cory's a big-time asshole.

701
00:38:52.417 --> 00:38:54.332
But Aaron and Jennifer
are my real friends.

702
00:38:54.854 --> 00:38:56.464
Even Leyla. in a weird way.

703
00:38:57.291 --> 00:38:58.945
And yeah.
the boys used to bully me

704
00:38:58.988 --> 00:39:00.816
a bit back in high school.

705
00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.471
but college really gave us
a chance to bond and reconnect.

706
00:39:04.298 --> 00:39:06.039
And some of us
outgrew the pettiness.

707
00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:09.259
Notice I said some of us.

708
00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:12.828
Well. you know
how to make people laugh.

709
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:16.005
I always liked that
about you. Bert.

710
00:39:31.891 --> 00:39:34.546
We had so much fun together.
I mean. you and me.

711
00:39:35.721 --> 00:39:37.287
I really missed you.

712
00:39:37.331 --> 00:39:39.725
And I haven't seen you
in a long. long time.

713
00:39:39.768 --> 00:39:42.205
I know. John. It sucks. man.

714
00:39:42.249 --> 00:39:44.860
I'm busy on the road
so much with my comedy act.

715
00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:47.776
And you. Mr. Big Shot
real estate agent

716
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.997
- in all of Kimble County.
- Thank you.

717
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.738
Look. I promise. you know.

718
00:39:52.781 --> 00:39:54.653
I'm gonna do my best
to make it back here more

719
00:39:54.696 --> 00:39:56.132
now that you and I
have connected again.

720
00:39:56.742 --> 00:39:57.830
Hey. Bert.

721
00:39:58.961 --> 00:40:00.398
I want to tell you something.

722
00:40:01.877 --> 00:40:03.836
I think
you already know. but...

723
00:40:05.185 --> 00:40:07.840
I just want to tell you. otherwise...

724
00:40:07.883 --> 00:40:09.668
I'm going to regret
for the rest of my life.

725
00:40:09.711 --> 00:40:11.147
John. it's okay.
you don't have to--

726
00:40:11.191 --> 00:40:12.888
Just let me say it. okay?

727
00:40:14.586 --> 00:40:17.415
I just-- Otherwise
I'm gonna lose my nerve.

728
00:40:17.458 --> 00:40:18.546
Okay.

729
00:40:19.199 --> 00:40:20.330
Here goes nothing.

730
00:40:22.376 --> 00:40:23.464
Bert Galindo...

731
00:40:26.249 --> 00:40:27.337
I think--

732
00:40:31.167 --> 00:40:32.342
John!

733
00:40:36.738 --> 00:40:38.087
No. John!

734
00:40:41.787 --> 00:40:43.266
What the fuck is going on?

735
00:41:21.827 --> 00:41:23.568
Bloody hell.

736
00:41:23.611 --> 00:41:25.265
They're taking their time.

737
00:41:34.579 --> 00:41:37.320
Long day. long shower.

738
00:41:37.973 --> 00:41:39.235
Lovely.

739
00:41:39.279 --> 00:41:40.976
Let's see what's going on.

740
00:41:42.543 --> 00:41:46.286
There is...

741
00:41:47.809 --> 00:41:49.071
They will like it.

742
00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.338
Hey. guys.
I don't mean to interrupt

743
00:41:55.382 --> 00:41:57.384
whatever you are doing.

744
00:41:57.427 --> 00:42:00.430
but I've got two cold ones.

745
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:02.563
Can you hear me?

746
00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:05.566
Hello?

747
00:42:06.001 --> 00:42:09.048
Hello?

748
00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.398
All right.

749
00:42:57.052 --> 00:42:58.140
Okay.

750
00:43:10.718 --> 00:43:12.067
Damn.

751
00:43:13.112 --> 00:43:15.636
Oh. that's a damn shame.
God damn it!

752
00:43:16.724 --> 00:43:18.508
Oh. God.

753
00:43:18.552 --> 00:43:21.381
Hey. Sheriff-- Holy shit.

754
00:43:21.424 --> 00:43:23.383
Is that Annie Eastman?

755
00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:27.126
Yeah. it is. Gibson.

756
00:43:27.822 --> 00:43:29.563
That's a shitty-ass way to go.

757
00:43:32.958 --> 00:43:34.307
Yeah. that's too bad.

758
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.397
She was very nice to me
and my girls.

759
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.833
All the time.

760
00:43:38.877 --> 00:43:40.487
What the hell happened?
Was she murdered?

761
00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:43.882
Yeah. Stabbed. pretty certain.
Look at that.

762
00:43:46.058 --> 00:43:47.189
Yep.

763
00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:49.931
What do you think you make
something like that with?

764
00:43:50.889 --> 00:43:54.283
Well. something precise.
something long.

765
00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:58.200
You know. it almost seems like
a-- like a-- like a glove

766
00:43:58.244 --> 00:44:01.595
with little knives at the end.
you know. like Freddy Krueger.

767
00:44:02.117 --> 00:44:05.207
Just a joke.

768
00:44:05.251 --> 00:44:06.687
Yeah. I know.

769
00:44:11.518 --> 00:44:13.215
But. honestly. what do you
think could do that?

770
00:44:15.391 --> 00:44:17.698
- It looks like a pitchfork.
- Yeah.

771
00:44:20.875 --> 00:44:22.050
You guys can go.

772
00:44:23.312 --> 00:44:25.271
Yeah. yeah. a pitchfork. yeah.

773
00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.187
That might be it.
Gibson. that's pretty smart.

774
00:44:29.362 --> 00:44:30.580
Listen. why don't you go...

775
00:44:31.756 --> 00:44:33.322
check the perimeter.

776
00:44:33.366 --> 00:44:34.976
make sure there's nothing
we missed or something?

777
00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.238
Yeah.

778
00:44:36.282 --> 00:44:38.240
I got to go check
on Dan the Tan

779
00:44:38.284 --> 00:44:41.679
'cause I guess he won't be open
for business tomorrow. will he?

780
00:44:41.722 --> 00:44:43.506
- Dan. too?
- Yeah.

781
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:44.682
Shit.

782
00:44:46.161 --> 00:44:47.772
You know. he and I used
to go fishing all the time.

783
00:44:47.815 --> 00:44:49.251
- Did you really?
- Yeah.

784
00:44:51.471 --> 00:44:52.690
What'd you guys catch?

785
00:44:54.169 --> 00:44:56.215
You know. the usual.
Trout. Whatever's in the river.

786
00:44:56.258 --> 00:44:58.478
- Bluegill?
- One or two. maybe.

787
00:44:58.521 --> 00:45:00.175
- Perch?
- Yeah.

788
00:45:00.219 --> 00:45:02.134
You know something?
I don't give a shit.

789
00:45:03.091 --> 00:45:04.789
Right.

790
00:45:04.832 --> 00:45:06.660
Why don't you just go
take a look like I told you to

791
00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:07.748
and just follow an order?

792
00:45:07.792 --> 00:45:08.880
Yes. sir.

793
00:45:16.844 --> 00:45:18.803
Holy fuck.

794
00:45:18.846 --> 00:45:20.152
Damn. how did this happen?

795
00:45:20.195 --> 00:45:21.719
Okay. guys.

796
00:45:22.763 --> 00:45:24.069
Time to go now.

797
00:45:24.112 --> 00:45:26.636
Get out of here.
It's a crime scene

798
00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.769
and you both shouldn't be here.
and you know that. so get out.

799
00:45:28.813 --> 00:45:30.902
Look. we know that's Annie.
We went to school with her.

800
00:45:30.945 --> 00:45:32.817
- What the fuck happened?
- Yeah.

801
00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.340
Okay.

802
00:45:34.383 --> 00:45:37.647
It's a homicide investigation.
all right?

803
00:45:37.691 --> 00:45:39.171
That's all I'm gonna say.

804
00:45:39.214 --> 00:45:40.694
The both of you.
get out of here.

805
00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:42.478
You don't.
I'll get Deputy Gibson

806
00:45:42.522 --> 00:45:44.437
to come over
and escort you out.

807
00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.395
Maybe I'll just arrest
the both of yous.

808
00:45:46.439 --> 00:45:48.354
Okay? It's up to you.

809
00:45:49.398 --> 00:45:50.486
Let's go. bro.

810
00:45:50.922 --> 00:45:52.619
Sheriff's being a fucking dick.

811
00:45:54.316 --> 00:45:55.404
And Jennifer's
in the car waiting.

812
00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.971
It's time to get going.

813
00:45:58.277 --> 00:45:59.669
Let's get the hell out of here.

814
00:45:59.713 --> 00:46:00.801
There's nothing
we could do anyway.

815
00:46:00.845 --> 00:46:02.672
No. you're right
about that. son.

816
00:46:07.286 --> 00:46:08.809
- Danny.
- Shit!

817
00:46:08.853 --> 00:46:10.202
Jesus Christ.

818
00:46:10.855 --> 00:46:13.727
By the way. it's Deputy.
remember? Lawman.

819
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:16.208
Yeah. well. I kicked your ass
plenty of times in high school.

820
00:46:16.251 --> 00:46:17.818
- We got a question.
- What?

821
00:46:18.906 --> 00:46:20.255
Do y'all know who killed Annie?

822
00:46:21.039 --> 00:46:23.476
No. I do not know
who killed Annie.

823
00:46:23.519 --> 00:46:25.652
The only thing I know
is whoever's doing it

824
00:46:25.695 --> 00:46:27.959
is very creative
and a sick motherfucker.

825
00:46:28.916 --> 00:46:30.744
We just saw her
before the reunion.

826
00:46:30.788 --> 00:46:32.441
- Yeah. yeah.
- Wait.

827
00:46:33.965 --> 00:46:35.575
You saw her earlier?

828
00:46:35.618 --> 00:46:37.446
Like. you were
the last ones to see her alive?

829
00:46:39.579 --> 00:46:40.667
I don't know.

830
00:46:41.102 --> 00:46:42.234
What were y'all doing?

831
00:46:43.713 --> 00:46:45.498
She was closing up shop.
and Jen wanted to talk about...

832
00:46:46.412 --> 00:46:47.848
a teddy bear.

833
00:46:47.892 --> 00:46:49.589
Okay. look.
I don't have time for this.

834
00:46:49.632 --> 00:46:51.460
I gotta get back to my boss.

835
00:46:51.504 --> 00:46:53.549
Y'all just be careful and get
the hell out of here. okay?

836
00:46:53.593 --> 00:46:55.725
All right. Thanks. Danny.

837
00:46:56.683 --> 00:46:58.728
It's Deputy.

838
00:47:02.123 --> 00:47:04.865
Robert. you need
to clean this shit up pronto.

839
00:47:04.909 --> 00:47:07.520
Listen. Mayor.
how was I supposed to know

840
00:47:07.563 --> 00:47:10.262
there was gonna be
two homicides in this town?

841
00:47:10.305 --> 00:47:12.177
The worst thing
that ever happened around here

842
00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.701
was kids popping wheelies
up at the dunes

843
00:47:14.744 --> 00:47:16.616
or shooting drugs somewhere.

844
00:47:16.659 --> 00:47:18.183
What the hell
was I supposed to know

845
00:47:18.226 --> 00:47:19.793
this kind of thing
would happen around here?

846
00:47:20.315 --> 00:47:21.795
Honestly?

847
00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:24.319
Listen. this town
is on its last leg

848
00:47:24.363 --> 00:47:26.234
thanks to the development
of Kerrville.

849
00:47:26.278 --> 00:47:29.150
We need
all the tourism we can get.

850
00:47:29.194 --> 00:47:31.326
People need to spend
money in Junction.

851
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:34.547
If they don't spend money.
we don't get funds.

852
00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:35.896
You don't get funds!

853
00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.943
And I can't keep tapping
the city coffer.

854
00:47:39.465 --> 00:47:42.598
- Comprende?
- Oh. I comprende.

855
00:47:42.642 --> 00:47:45.079
Little bit more than you might
remember. I comprende.

856
00:47:45.819 --> 00:47:48.169
I know all about
your embezzling

857
00:47:48.213 --> 00:47:51.303
and so do you. by the way.
before you jump ship on me.

858
00:47:51.346 --> 00:47:52.695
Best jump of my life.

859
00:47:53.305 --> 00:47:56.003
Apparently. Good for you.

860
00:47:56.047 --> 00:47:58.049
Listen. how would you like it

861
00:47:58.092 --> 00:48:00.007
if I let that
white trash reporter

862
00:48:00.051 --> 00:48:02.053
know all about your little late
night gambling problems. huh?

863
00:48:02.096 --> 00:48:03.881
- You wouldn't dare.
- Wanna bet?

864
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:05.883
You try me. bub.

865
00:48:05.926 --> 00:48:07.623
You fucking prick.

866
00:48:07.667 --> 00:48:10.148
You keep putting
that goddamn thing in my face

867
00:48:10.191 --> 00:48:11.323
and we'll see who crosses who.

868
00:48:11.932 --> 00:48:13.673
- Listen. Robert.
- Yeah?

869
00:48:13.716 --> 00:48:16.719
You need to do your job
or I'm going to fire your ass.

870
00:48:16.763 --> 00:48:18.243
Go ahead and do that.
you bald-headed prick.

871
00:48:20.419 --> 00:48:21.594
Let's go. Julie.

872
00:48:22.464 --> 00:48:23.944
Yeah.

873
00:48:31.343 --> 00:48:32.431
What the hell do you want?

874
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.259
What the hell was that about?

875
00:48:35.825 --> 00:48:38.654
It's about the mayor
being a bald-headed prick.

876
00:48:39.133 --> 00:48:40.395
Same goddamn thing.

877
00:48:41.005 --> 00:48:42.397
Did you find out anything else?

878
00:48:43.007 --> 00:48:44.095
Actually. yeah.

879
00:48:45.531 --> 00:48:46.662
Remember that group
that we pulled over yesterday?

880
00:48:46.706 --> 00:48:47.925
Yeah.

881
00:48:47.968 --> 00:48:49.230
Well. Aaron Johnson
and his friends...

882
00:48:49.274 --> 00:48:50.884
Yeah.

883
00:48:50.928 --> 00:48:53.234
...saw both victims
before they were murdered.

884
00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:54.932
No kidding?

885
00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.673
Wow. Well. that's interesting.

886
00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:22.350
Leyley?

887
00:49:23.047 --> 00:49:24.744
- Bert?
- Bert?

888
00:49:24.787 --> 00:49:26.180
Where are they?

889
00:49:26.224 --> 00:49:27.834
There's no car outside.

890
00:49:27.877 --> 00:49:29.270
That's-- that's weird.

891
00:49:29.314 --> 00:49:30.445
Leyla?

892
00:49:34.058 --> 00:49:35.407
Hey Ley. you here?

893
00:49:39.977 --> 00:49:41.108
Maybe they're out
in the garage.

894
00:49:42.501 --> 00:49:43.719
- I should go check.
- No. I'll-- I'll go.

895
00:49:43.763 --> 00:49:45.983
I should probably
patch things up with Bert.

896
00:49:46.635 --> 00:49:48.202
Oh. that's real mature of you.

897
00:50:11.182 --> 00:50:12.705
Uh...

898
00:50:14.402 --> 00:50:15.925
Hey. guys. uh.

899
00:50:15.969 --> 00:50:17.797
I don't mean to interrupt
or anything. but...

900
00:50:19.364 --> 00:50:20.800
I know you're probably
still pissed at me.

901
00:50:20.843 --> 00:50:23.629
but I was thinking.
what if you. uh...

902
00:50:24.499 --> 00:50:26.458
What if I let you hit me
as hard as you can?

903
00:50:27.198 --> 00:50:28.460
Just to even things out?

904
00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:31.941
What do you say?

905
00:50:35.684 --> 00:50:36.772
Hey.

906
00:50:37.251 --> 00:50:39.253
I'm-- I'm trying
to apologize here.

907
00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:44.693
Hey. guys. what the--

908
00:50:49.394 --> 00:50:51.570
What the fuck?

909
00:50:54.225 --> 00:50:55.356
What the--

910
00:50:57.924 --> 00:50:59.447
Who the fuck are you?

911
00:51:06.802 --> 00:51:08.413
Hey!

912
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.684
We need to get out of here now.
Like. right fucking now. okay?

913
00:51:18.727 --> 00:51:20.077
What the fuck's
gotten into you?

914
00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.426
Bert and John
are dead in the car.

915
00:51:21.469 --> 00:51:23.210
What?
Is this a sick fucking joke?

916
00:51:23.254 --> 00:51:24.733
I'm not fucking joking. okay?

917
00:51:24.777 --> 00:51:26.213
They're in the fucking car. dead.

918
00:51:26.257 --> 00:51:27.954
And we need to get
out of here right now.

919
00:51:27.997 --> 00:51:29.695
- What is going on? Cory!
- There was this

920
00:51:29.738 --> 00:51:31.436
this little girl or something.

921
00:51:31.479 --> 00:51:33.351
She was. like.
sick or rabid. and she threw--

922
00:51:33.394 --> 00:51:35.092
she tried to kill me
with a pitchfork.

923
00:51:35.135 --> 00:51:36.658
and I think
she killed Bert and John.

924
00:51:36.702 --> 00:51:38.356
What? Hold on.
You saw someone out there?

925
00:51:39.183 --> 00:51:40.880
What?

926
00:51:44.057 --> 00:51:45.754
Go. go. go.
go. go. go. go. go.

927
00:51:45.798 --> 00:51:48.888
Who the fuck--
who the fuck was that?

928
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.629
We need to leave.

929
00:51:50.672 --> 00:51:52.021
Call the police.
We gotta get out of here.

930
00:51:52.065 --> 00:51:53.110
Wait. wait. wait.
Where's Leyla?

931
00:51:53.153 --> 00:51:54.198
Shit. Leyla.

932
00:51:54.241 --> 00:51:55.808
Leyla!

933
00:51:58.027 --> 00:51:59.116
Leyla?

934
00:52:03.685 --> 00:52:05.296
- What?
- What the fuck. man?

935
00:52:05.339 --> 00:52:08.690
Oh. my God. Okay.
Cory. come on. Come on. bro.

936
00:52:09.213 --> 00:52:10.953
She's-- she's gone. man.
She's gone. Cory.

937
00:52:10.997 --> 00:52:12.346
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

938
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:14.174
- Cory. she's gone. dude!
- Show yourself!

939
00:52:14.218 --> 00:52:15.871
- Cory. get in the car.
- I'll fucking kill you!

940
00:52:15.915 --> 00:52:17.830
She's-- she's gone.
man. she's gone.

941
00:52:17.873 --> 00:52:19.788
Get in the car.
Get in the car. Cory.

942
00:52:19.832 --> 00:52:22.226
Okay. I'll call the police.
Shit. No signal. fuck!

943
00:52:22.269 --> 00:52:24.619
- Fuck. Fuck!
- Fuck.

944
00:52:48.295 --> 00:52:50.558
Hey. buddy. Hey. hey. hey.

945
00:52:59.437 --> 00:53:00.916
Oh. shit.

946
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.831
Guys. we gotta get
the fuck out of here.

947
00:53:02.875 --> 00:53:04.093
- What's going on?
- She killed the deputy.

948
00:53:04.529 --> 00:53:05.747
- So what do we do?
- Please. please...

949
00:53:05.791 --> 00:53:07.314
Fuck.

950
00:53:07.923 --> 00:53:09.708
Fuck. Shit.

951
00:53:09.751 --> 00:53:11.362
We got-- we gotta
make a run for it.

952
00:53:11.405 --> 00:53:13.233
- Fuck.
- Yeah. we gotta.

953
00:53:13.277 --> 00:53:14.321
We gotta go.

954
00:53:15.322 --> 00:53:16.454
Fucking bear.

955
00:53:22.155 --> 00:53:23.635
Yeah. Who is it?

956
00:53:24.418 --> 00:53:25.637
Sorry.

957
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.768
My friends and I.

958
00:53:27.291 --> 00:53:29.684
we're looking
for a Jim Ravenfeather.

959
00:53:30.555 --> 00:53:32.078
We were told
this is the right address.

960
00:53:33.253 --> 00:53:35.386
Maybe it is. What's it to you?

961
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:38.302
We voted for that other guy.
if that's why you're here.

962
00:53:38.345 --> 00:53:41.957
No. no. um. we were told
Mr. Ravenfeather could help us.

963
00:53:42.393 --> 00:53:44.395
- Does he live here?
- Sure he lives here. gorgeous.

964
00:53:44.873 --> 00:53:46.223
Jim Ravenfeather's
my grandfather.

965
00:53:47.006 --> 00:53:48.094
Why do you need to see him?

966
00:53:48.529 --> 00:53:51.010
And exactly
who are you. gorgeous?

967
00:53:51.053 --> 00:53:53.186
- Leave her alone.
- Whoa. chill.

968
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:54.361
I meant nothing by it.

969
00:53:55.188 --> 00:53:56.233
But like I said...

970
00:53:57.756 --> 00:53:59.279
Who are you?

971
00:53:59.323 --> 00:54:01.716
I'm Jennifer.
This is Aaron. That's Cory.

972
00:54:03.631 --> 00:54:05.764
We were told
Mr. Ravenfeather could help us.

973
00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:07.548
Can we see him?

974
00:54:07.592 --> 00:54:08.767
He never leaves
the house anymore.

975
00:54:09.289 --> 00:54:10.334
Not since...

976
00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:13.293
For a while.

977
00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:15.948
You can come in. I guess.

978
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:17.950
But he may not be up
for visitors.

979
00:54:17.993 --> 00:54:19.430
And if he isn't.

980
00:54:19.473 --> 00:54:20.866
then you got
to get the fuck out of here.

981
00:54:20.909 --> 00:54:21.997
Understand?

982
00:54:23.477 --> 00:54:24.652
Ye-- yes.

983
00:54:26.915 --> 00:54:28.047
Thank you.

984
00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:52.463
Who are these people?

985
00:54:52.898 --> 00:54:55.117
Grandfather.
I let these white folks in.

986
00:54:55.422 --> 00:54:56.771
They need your help. they said.

987
00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:58.860
This here's Jennifer and. uh.

988
00:54:58.904 --> 00:55:00.645
I forgot
your other two's names.

989
00:55:00.688 --> 00:55:02.777
Sir. my name's Aaron Johnson.

990
00:55:02.821 --> 00:55:05.563
This is my fiancée.
Jennifer Corolla.

991
00:55:05.606 --> 00:55:07.216
and that's my brother. Cory.

992
00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:09.349
Corolla?

993
00:55:10.481 --> 00:55:12.613
As in Franky Corolla?

994
00:55:13.527 --> 00:55:15.399
That old son of a bitch
that used to own

995
00:55:15.442 --> 00:55:16.704
the pizza parlor in town?

996
00:55:16.748 --> 00:55:18.750
Yeah. that's my dad.

997
00:55:19.446 --> 00:55:20.534
Did you know him?

998
00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:22.754
It's a little town.
little lady.

999
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:25.365
I know a lot about this town.

1000
00:55:27.236 --> 00:55:28.716
I know a lot about your family.

1001
00:55:30.718 --> 00:55:32.198
Guys. we don't
have time for this.

1002
00:55:32.241 --> 00:55:33.721
that pitchfork girl
killed our friends.

1003
00:55:33.765 --> 00:55:35.419
and she's still
fucking looking for us.

1004
00:55:35.462 --> 00:55:37.159
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1005
00:55:38.726 --> 00:55:40.902
Man. I knew you white people
were fucking crazy.

1006
00:55:40.946 --> 00:55:42.295
What'd you call me?

1007
00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:43.644
Get the fuck
out of our goddamn house.

1008
00:55:43.688 --> 00:55:45.342
Benji.

1009
00:55:47.605 --> 00:55:48.693
Please continue.

1010
00:55:50.085 --> 00:55:51.522
Several people
have been murdered.

1011
00:55:53.175 --> 00:55:55.264
It all started when we got this
old box from Annie Eastman.

1012
00:55:55.874 --> 00:55:57.223
She said you sold it to her?

1013
00:55:57.266 --> 00:55:59.094
Is the box still sealed?

1014
00:56:00.139 --> 00:56:02.489
Tell me
you did not open the box.

1015
00:56:02.533 --> 00:56:04.143
Yes. we opened the fucking box.

1016
00:56:04.186 --> 00:56:05.710
there was a fucking teddy bear.

1017
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.582
What the fuck. Grandpa?

1018
00:56:09.496 --> 00:56:10.845
Is that what we felt
the other night?

1019
00:56:12.194 --> 00:56:13.239
Son of a bitch.

1020
00:56:14.414 --> 00:56:17.722
After all these decades.
she's come back.

1021
00:56:18.853 --> 00:56:20.159
You said she...

1022
00:56:20.899 --> 00:56:22.466
she was killing townspeople?

1023
00:56:22.509 --> 00:56:23.945
She slaughtered our friends.

1024
00:56:24.555 --> 00:56:25.773
She's still looking for us.

1025
00:56:25.817 --> 00:56:26.905
Please.

1026
00:56:26.948 --> 00:56:28.123
Do you know how to stop her?

1027
00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.302
There's nothing I can do.

1028
00:56:33.912 --> 00:56:35.087
I'm sorry.

1029
00:56:35.609 --> 00:56:37.437
You came
all this way for nothing.

1030
00:56:37.481 --> 00:56:39.874
Please. Mr. Ravenfeather.
I'm begging you.

1031
00:56:41.006 --> 00:56:42.486
We don't know how to stop her.

1032
00:56:43.922 --> 00:56:46.359
She killed our friends.
people in the town.

1033
00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:47.752
she's gonna kill us. too.

1034
00:56:48.579 --> 00:56:50.232
Do you want that
on your conscience?

1035
00:56:50.755 --> 00:56:52.234
There's nothing I can do.

1036
00:56:52.931 --> 00:56:55.760
Fuck. we're wasting our time
with this dumbass Indian.

1037
00:56:55.803 --> 00:56:57.414
- Hey. watch it. motherfucker.
- Please.

1038
00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:01.026
Excuse my brother.
He's an idiot.

1039
00:57:01.766 --> 00:57:04.943
But. sir. our friends are dead.

1040
00:57:05.465 --> 00:57:06.988
Please. help us.

1041
00:57:07.859 --> 00:57:09.687
We have no other options.

1042
00:57:10.514 --> 00:57:11.776
You're our last hope.

1043
00:57:13.604 --> 00:57:14.996
You have to know something.

1044
00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:18.652
For the love of God. for your
town. for the people in it...

1045
00:57:19.523 --> 00:57:20.611
tell us what you know.

1046
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:22.308
Please.

1047
00:57:27.313 --> 00:57:28.619
I was the witness...

1048
00:57:30.011 --> 00:57:31.360
the only witness...

1049
00:57:32.536 --> 00:57:34.320
of the birth of pure evil.

1050
00:57:35.669 --> 00:57:37.454
Of a powerful vengeance.

1051
00:57:38.977 --> 00:57:40.065
Of a wraith...

1052
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:44.939
named Ami Cutter.

1053
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.116
Ami and I were friends.

1054
00:57:49.596 --> 00:57:50.684
I first met Ami...

1055
00:57:53.861 --> 00:57:55.776
after my father
lost our family home.

1056
00:57:57.474 --> 00:57:58.779
And her father. her...

1057
00:58:00.346 --> 00:58:01.521
stepfather...

1058
00:58:04.176 --> 00:58:06.178
purchased it at auction.

1059
00:58:07.396 --> 00:58:10.399
I used to go every Sunday
down to their farm...

1060
00:58:12.706 --> 00:58:13.794
for high tea...

1061
00:58:15.013 --> 00:58:16.101
with her...

1062
00:58:17.363 --> 00:58:18.495
and her stuffed bear.

1063
00:58:20.279 --> 00:58:21.715
It was one of those Sundays...

1064
00:58:23.543 --> 00:58:24.718
that's when I...

1065
00:58:27.939 --> 00:58:29.244
I saw her murdered...

1066
00:58:31.377 --> 00:58:32.509
at the hands...

1067
00:58:33.988 --> 00:58:35.163
of her stepfather.

1068
00:58:37.818 --> 00:58:40.212
He picked up a pitchfork...

1069
00:58:42.823 --> 00:58:44.172
and ran her through.

1070
00:58:45.434 --> 00:58:48.046
It wasn't until the next night

1071
00:58:48.089 --> 00:58:51.136
that I summoned up
the courage...

1072
00:58:52.964 --> 00:58:56.097
to go back to the farm to see

1073
00:58:56.402 --> 00:58:57.925
what had happened
to her father.

1074
00:58:58.622 --> 00:59:00.580
You know what?

1075
00:59:00.624 --> 00:59:03.888
After seeing him
talking to himself.

1076
00:59:03.931 --> 00:59:07.282
drinking.
laughing. and crying...

1077
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:11.678
I swore I could hear a voice.

1078
00:59:13.071 --> 00:59:14.812
It caught the attention
of her father.

1079
00:59:18.598 --> 00:59:20.252
He started
to yell out her name.

1080
00:59:24.996 --> 00:59:26.650
And that's when
I heard her laughter.

1081
00:59:29.522 --> 00:59:30.741
Then she appeared...

1082
00:59:32.394 --> 00:59:33.918
like a mist.

1083
00:59:33.961 --> 00:59:35.920
She took the pitchfork...

1084
00:59:40.359 --> 00:59:42.361
and ran her father through.

1085
00:59:43.884 --> 00:59:45.494
Then the strangest
thing happened.

1086
00:59:48.149 --> 00:59:49.368
She reached down...

1087
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:54.460
and picked up the teddy bear.

1088
00:59:57.289 --> 00:59:58.595
She hugged it...

1089
01:00:03.643 --> 01:00:05.036
and she looked up at me...

1090
01:00:08.996 --> 01:00:10.607
but she was looking
right through me.

1091
01:00:16.569 --> 01:00:17.831
And then she disappeared.

1092
01:00:22.531 --> 01:00:23.620
I ran over.

1093
01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:30.061
I picked up the bear.

1094
01:00:33.978 --> 01:00:35.936
The only thing
I had left of my friend.

1095
01:00:40.158 --> 01:00:44.118
I ran home
with the bear and I put it...

1096
01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:46.817
in a suitcase.

1097
01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:49.994
I kept it safe for 30 years.

1098
01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.739
Until I...

1099
01:00:58.132 --> 01:00:59.612
sold it to the Eastmans.

1100
01:01:04.399 --> 01:01:06.010
I think they knew
what was in it.

1101
01:01:06.053 --> 01:01:08.403
Wait. who was Ami's
real father?

1102
01:01:08.447 --> 01:01:10.014
Ami's real father...

1103
01:01:12.059 --> 01:01:14.540
was a man that Ami's mother
was having an affair with.

1104
01:01:16.803 --> 01:01:17.935
He was sheriff at the time.

1105
01:01:17.978 --> 01:01:19.545
Well. why is she killing us?

1106
01:01:19.588 --> 01:01:20.938
Why is she chasing us?

1107
01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:22.504
We didn't do anything wrong.

1108
01:01:22.548 --> 01:01:23.941
You haven't done
anything wrong.

1109
01:01:26.334 --> 01:01:30.034
I should have gotten rid
of the bear properly.

1110
01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:33.907
It's the bear.

1111
01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:41.393
It's the connection between her
and the world of the living.

1112
01:01:41.436 --> 01:01:43.264
She must have a human host.

1113
01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:48.748
She must have her blood...

1114
01:01:49.793 --> 01:01:51.795
the blood of her relations.

1115
01:01:51.838 --> 01:01:53.492
She'll eventually fade away.

1116
01:01:53.535 --> 01:01:56.103
unless she possesses
a relative of hers?

1117
01:01:57.757 --> 01:02:00.934
Yes. she must have
that human host

1118
01:02:00.978 --> 01:02:02.501
and she's growing weak.

1119
01:02:02.936 --> 01:02:06.766
The more she kills.
the stronger she gets.

1120
01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.115
Mr. Ravenfeather...

1121
01:02:09.813 --> 01:02:11.292
who is Ami's blood?

1122
01:02:12.554 --> 01:02:13.991
Don't ask questions...

1123
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:16.776
that you know the answer to.

1124
01:02:18.473 --> 01:02:21.825
Wait. so are you saying
Jennifer is Ami's blood?

1125
01:02:21.868 --> 01:02:24.349
Ami's real father
was Sheriff Corolla.

1126
01:02:25.393 --> 01:02:28.396
Jennifer's grandfather.

1127
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.963
Well. how do we kill
this bitch?

1128
01:02:30.442 --> 01:02:32.618
You cannot kill it.
It is energy.

1129
01:02:32.966 --> 01:02:37.754
And energy. you can only hope
to transform it or contain it.

1130
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:40.713
Well. can we just put
the bear back in the box?

1131
01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.193
Can we do the box thing again?

1132
01:02:42.671 --> 01:02:43.847
We cannot.

1133
01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:45.239
The seal has been broken.

1134
01:02:45.283 --> 01:02:46.850
and it would take
too long to recreate it.

1135
01:02:47.676 --> 01:02:49.287
The only hope is to bury it...

1136
01:02:50.505 --> 01:02:51.637
in consecrated ground.

1137
01:02:52.159 --> 01:02:54.161
Unless anyone
who looks at it...

1138
01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:56.468
or touches it...

1139
01:02:57.295 --> 01:02:59.340
will feel the wraith within.

1140
01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:00.864
Like a cemetery?

1141
01:03:01.255 --> 01:03:02.822
Is there one close by?

1142
01:03:02.866 --> 01:03:05.520
Yes. if you cut through
the old rodeo ground.

1143
01:03:05.825 --> 01:03:08.132
you'll end up
at Red Rock Cemetery.

1144
01:03:08.175 --> 01:03:09.698
We just have
to fucking bury this?

1145
01:03:15.879 --> 01:03:19.056
Peckerwood. I know
you're not that stupid.

1146
01:03:19.883 --> 01:03:21.754
Do you realize
what you've just done?

1147
01:03:23.277 --> 01:03:25.279
- I'm sorry.
- Please.

1148
01:03:25.323 --> 01:03:26.454
I'm sorry.

1149
01:03:26.498 --> 01:03:28.979
Exit our home.

1150
01:03:32.417 --> 01:03:33.461
Damn you all.

1151
01:03:34.332 --> 01:03:35.724
Get them the fuck out.

1152
01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:38.989
So over this
Evil Deadshit...

1153
01:03:52.959 --> 01:03:56.093
Grandad?

1154
01:04:21.988 --> 01:04:26.079
So. Bert and Leyla.
whoever else the fuck is dead

1155
01:04:26.123 --> 01:04:27.820
because it's Jennifer's fault.

1156
01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.300
- Cory. back off. it's not--
- Don't fucking hit me!

1157
01:04:29.343 --> 01:04:30.605
- Cory. back off.
- I'll kick your ass.

1158
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.652
I don't want to fight you.

1159
01:04:34.479 --> 01:04:36.089
I just want to get rid
of this damn curse

1160
01:04:36.133 --> 01:04:37.482
and make it out of here alive.

1161
01:04:37.525 --> 01:04:38.962
I'm sure Bert would like
to get out alive.

1162
01:04:39.005 --> 01:04:40.572
- Or John. or Leyla.
- Cory--

1163
01:04:40.615 --> 01:04:42.095
I'm sure she'd like
to not be fucking dead.

1164
01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:43.227
Okay. enough.

1165
01:04:43.836 --> 01:04:44.924
Stop it.

1166
01:04:46.099 --> 01:04:47.187
This isn't helping.

1167
01:04:48.493 --> 01:04:50.147
Okay. we have to figure out
how to end this

1168
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:51.975
so that nobody else dies.

1169
01:04:52.018 --> 01:04:54.107
I don't fucking care
who else dies. she's dead.

1170
01:04:55.717 --> 01:04:56.805
Leyla?

1171
01:04:58.459 --> 01:05:00.244
You never knew how much
she meant to me. did you?

1172
01:05:02.507 --> 01:05:04.117
- Cory. I'm--
- Forget it.

1173
01:05:08.382 --> 01:05:10.819
I gotta fucking finish this
for Bert and Leyla.

1174
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:14.475
Come on. let's go.

1175
01:05:53.819 --> 01:05:54.994
Babe. Babe.

1176
01:05:55.908 --> 01:05:56.953
Oh. my God. are you okay?

1177
01:05:58.432 --> 01:05:59.520
What happened to your arm?

1178
01:06:00.695 --> 01:06:01.870
How long has it been like that?

1179
01:06:01.914 --> 01:06:02.959
What the fuck?

1180
01:06:03.002 --> 01:06:04.395
Oh. my God. Cory!

1181
01:06:04.438 --> 01:06:05.918
- Cory.
- Cory!

1182
01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:07.572
What y'all doing here?

1183
01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:09.269
This is private property.
you can't be here.

1184
01:06:09.313 --> 01:06:10.879
He scared
the shit out of me. okay?

1185
01:06:10.923 --> 01:06:12.446
Put the pitchfork away.

1186
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:15.884
Please. sir. we just need
to find the main road.

1187
01:06:15.928 --> 01:06:17.277
We got lost.

1188
01:06:17.321 --> 01:06:18.713
Just lead us
in the right direction.

1189
01:06:20.585 --> 01:06:22.674
Um. okay.

1190
01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:25.242
It's over this way.

1191
01:06:25.807 --> 01:06:26.939
Follow me.

1192
01:06:28.375 --> 01:06:29.898
I don't know how you got here
this time of night.

1193
01:06:34.512 --> 01:06:38.037
Oh. shit. Shit.

1194
01:06:41.954 --> 01:06:44.435
- Aaron. run!
- Cory. no!

1195
01:06:47.916 --> 01:06:49.135
Hey!

1196
01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:51.616
Not so tough
without your toy. huh?

1197
01:06:58.666 --> 01:06:59.754
Cory!

1198
01:07:22.951 --> 01:07:24.605
This way.

1199
01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:34.398
Trust me.

1200
01:07:42.536 --> 01:07:45.061
Jen. Jen.

1201
01:08:18.616 --> 01:08:22.837
Oh. shit. Cutter.
Jen!

1202
01:08:36.764 --> 01:08:38.026
Jennifer?

1203
01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:40.377
Babe!

1204
01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:42.683
Where are you?

1205
01:08:42.727 --> 01:08:44.729
Trust me.

1206
01:08:47.862 --> 01:08:49.821
Jen! Get away from her!

1207
01:08:50.256 --> 01:08:51.910
Jennifer.

1208
01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:00.223
Jen.

1209
01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:12.452
Jen. Jen.
You gotta fight her. Jen.

1210
01:09:12.496 --> 01:09:15.151
Please. Fight her.
This isn't you.

1211
01:09:15.629 --> 01:09:16.761
This is not you.

1212
01:09:19.416 --> 01:09:21.722
J-- Jen.
you don't have to do this.

1213
01:09:21.766 --> 01:09:25.335
Jen. Please.

1214
01:09:25.378 --> 01:09:28.120
Please.
Please. Jen. fight her.

1215
01:09:28.164 --> 01:09:29.208
Please.

1216
01:09:30.688 --> 01:09:33.212
Please. Jen.
I love you. please.

1217
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:45.703
Are you okay?

1218
01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:52.884
Aaron. I can't.

1219
01:09:55.365 --> 01:09:56.453
Jen.

1220
01:09:57.105 --> 01:09:59.282
Aaron. I can't.
I can't hold on.

1221
01:10:00.761 --> 01:10:03.634
Jen. you have to fight her.

1222
01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.332
Please. she's too strong.

1223
01:10:07.681 --> 01:10:08.987
It's too late for me.

1224
01:10:09.857 --> 01:10:11.816
There's only one way
to end this.

1225
01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:15.559
- I'm not doing it. Jen.
- If you don't. she'll kill you.

1226
01:10:16.821 --> 01:10:18.649
I couldn't live
without you. either.

1227
01:10:19.432 --> 01:10:20.520
Please.

1228
01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:22.348
Jen.

1229
01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:25.917
- I can't.
- Aaron.

1230
01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.048
Shh.

1231
01:10:27.919 --> 01:10:29.137
I love you.

1232
01:10:30.574 --> 01:10:32.010
We have to keep going.

1233
01:10:41.411 --> 01:10:43.021
I'm sorry. baby.

1234
01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:54.641
I'm sorry. baby.

1235
01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:20.754
He's not having a great day.

1236
01:11:24.889 --> 01:11:26.586
Oh. look who's here.

1237
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:27.935
What's the story. Sheriff?

1238
01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:30.634
I don't know. You tell me.

1239
01:11:30.677 --> 01:11:33.245
I-- I don't understand
any of this shit.

1240
01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:36.988
This is all I know
is he come in here.

1241
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:41.122
talking about ghosts
and. uh. voodoo magic

1242
01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:44.212
and. uh. the whole town
is cursed and. uh...

1243
01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:47.215
everyone's getting
stabbed and...

1244
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.308
...his fiancée's
dead. and no motive.

1245
01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:53.961
And it all ends up
in the Cutter Farm

1246
01:11:54.005 --> 01:11:55.398
or Cutter Ranch and...

1247
01:11:56.747 --> 01:11:58.966
everybody stabbed to death.
all his friends.

1248
01:12:00.098 --> 01:12:02.666
It's all from. uh. Ami Cutter.

1249
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:03.797
All right?

1250
01:12:04.276 --> 01:12:07.410
And. uh. wha--
what'd you say she was?

1251
01:12:07.453 --> 01:12:08.715
Some kind of wraith.

1252
01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:10.456
A wraith.

1253
01:12:12.676 --> 01:12:13.851
Whatever that is.

1254
01:12:13.894 --> 01:12:15.809
Christ. Curse?

1255
01:12:15.853 --> 01:12:18.159
We don't need the town
talking about curses.

1256
01:12:18.203 --> 01:12:22.033
We need a concrete explanation.
for the good of this town.

1257
01:12:22.903 --> 01:12:24.514
and my tourist money.

1258
01:12:24.557 --> 01:12:26.342
I think we need
the truth. mayor.

1259
01:12:26.994 --> 01:12:29.432
Truth? We can make the truth
anything we want.

1260
01:12:29.475 --> 01:12:32.435
This is the age
of misinformation.

1261
01:12:32.478 --> 01:12:34.480
Let's use it to our advantage.

1262
01:12:34.524 --> 01:12:36.482
Whatever you say.
I'm on your payroll.

1263
01:12:36.526 --> 01:12:37.701
And here's the story.

1264
01:12:38.179 --> 01:12:40.399
Aaron Johnson came back to town

1265
01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:43.924
enacting his sick.
violent fantasies.

1266
01:12:43.968 --> 01:12:45.317
But our beloved sheriff...

1267
01:12:47.493 --> 01:12:49.756
saved the day
by getting a confession

1268
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.149
and can put him away for good.

1269
01:12:53.325 --> 01:12:54.631
End of story.

1270
01:12:54.674 --> 01:12:57.547
We cleansed the town
of any curse.

1271
01:12:58.765 --> 01:12:59.897
Use that.

1272
01:13:07.861 --> 01:13:09.297
Love to watch her leave.

1273
01:13:13.606 --> 01:13:14.781
So. what do we do now. sheriff?

1274
01:13:26.532 --> 01:13:30.231
I'm gonna tell the truth...
just like the mayor asked.

1275
01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:40.894
Whatever in the hell
that's gonna be.

1276
01:13:43.897 --> 01:13:45.377
Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor.

1277
01:13:45.899 --> 01:13:47.335
Marlene Rogers. KFOT.

1278
01:13:47.379 --> 01:13:48.946
We know who the fuck you are.

1279
01:13:48.989 --> 01:13:50.469
You do this all the time.

1280
01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:52.253
Was the killer caught tonight?

1281
01:13:52.297 --> 01:13:54.473
The mayor's not making any
comments right now. Marlene.

1282
01:13:54.517 --> 01:13:55.735

1290
01:14:12.665 --> 01:14:14.101

The ghost girl

Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor.
