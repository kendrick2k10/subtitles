1
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.370
Hold positions!

2
00:02:51.468 --> 00:02:55.068
Fire the arrows!

3
01:07:51.207 --> 01:07:54.507
Tin�viel the elven-fair

4
01:07:56.409 --> 01:08:02.709
Immortal maiden elven-wise

5
01:08:04.107 --> 01:08:10.007
About him cast her night-dark hair

6
01:08:10.507 --> 01:08:14.507
And arms like silver glimmering."

7
01:19:13.564 --> 01:19:17.964
l am Arwen - l've come to help you.

8
01:19:19.061 --> 01:19:23.361
Hear my voice...come back to the light.

9
01:19:54.961 --> 01:19:57.761
Stay with the Hobbits. l'll send horses for you.

10
01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.360
l'm the faster rider. l'll take him.

11
01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:01.860
The Road is too dangerous.

12
01:20:03.359 --> 01:20:05.159
Frodo is dying. lf l can get across the river...

13
01:20:05.458 --> 01:20:08.758
...the power of my people will protect him.

14
01:20:14.459 --> 01:20:15.959
As you wish.

15
01:21:45.252 --> 01:21:47.252
Ride fast Asfaloth!

16
01:22:47.548 --> 01:22:48.948
Waters of the Misty Mountains...

17
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:50.350
...listen to the great word.

18
01:22:50.448 --> 01:22:53.348
Flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths

19
01:22:53.548 --> 01:22:54.948
Waters of the Misty Mountains...

20
01:22:55.049 --> 01:22:56.449
...listen to the great word.

21
01:22:56.449 --> 01:23:00.349
Flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths

22
01:24:05.443 --> 01:24:09.443
Hear my voice...come back to the light.

23
01:35:46.185 --> 01:35:49.085
The shadow does not hold sway yet. Aragorn

24
01:35:49.585 --> 01:35:53.385
Not over you. not over me.

25
01:36:04.779 --> 01:36:08.479
Do you remember when we first met?

26
01:36:11.075 --> 01:36:15.275
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

27
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:18.870
Long years have passed.

28
01:36:19.769 --> 01:36:23.569
You did not wear the troubles you carry now.

29
01:36:25.765 --> 01:36:27.865
Do you remember what I told you?

30
01:38:58.989 --> 01:39:02.389
"One ring to rule them all...

31
01:39:02.687 --> 01:39:06.187
...One ring to find them...

32
01:39:06.587 --> 01:39:09.787
...One ring to bring them all...

33
01:39:12.584 --> 01:39:17.084
...and in the darkness bind them."

34
01:40:44.236 --> 01:40:46.436
Sit down. Legolas.

35
01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:00.360
One ring to rule them all...

36
01:43:14.407 --> 01:43:16.707
One ring to rule them all...

37
01:43:16.804 --> 01:43:19.204
...One ring to find them...

38
01:43:19.305 --> 01:43:21.305
One ring to rule them all...

39
01:43:21.403 --> 01:43:23.303
...One ring to find them...

40
01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.300
One ring to rule them all...

41
01:43:25.498 --> 01:43:27.498
...One ring to find them...

42
01:43:27.596 --> 01:43:29.596
One ring to rule them all...

43
01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.800
She wanted to protect her child.

44
01:46:17.099 --> 01:46:20.499
She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.

45
01:55:04.646 --> 01:55:11.646
Wake up cruel Redhorn!

46
01:55:21.898 --> 01:55:22.998
May your horn be bloodstained!

47
01:55:42.201 --> 01:55:48.201
Sleep Caradhras. be still. lie still. hold your wrath!

48
01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:53.500
Wake up cruel Redhorn!

49
01:55:53.701 --> 01:55:58.001
May your bloodstained horn...

50
01:55:58.202 --> 01:56:01.702
...fall upon enemy heads!

51
01:59:55.322 --> 02:00:00.422
Gate of the elves. open now for me!

52
02:00:11.124 --> 02:00:15.024
...listen to the word of my tongue.

53
02:00:50.128 --> 02:00:52.128
Gate of elves...

54
02:00:53.828 --> 02:00:56.328
...listen to my word...

55
02:00:56.828 --> 02:00:59.028
...threshold of dwarves...

56
02:01:06.328 --> 02:01:07.528
Doorway of the dwarf-folk...

57
02:31:20.391 --> 02:31:23.591
Welcome. Legolas son of Thranduil.

58
02:31:24.291 --> 02:31:25.891
Our fellowship stands in your debt.

59
02:31:25.990 --> 02:31:27.790
Haldir of L�rien.

60
02:31:29.491 --> 02:31:31.591
Oh. Aragorn of the D�nedain...

61
02:31:31.689 --> 02:31:34.089
...you are known to us.

62
02:31:46.593 --> 02:31:51.193
I spit upon your grave!

63
02:32:15.894 --> 02:32:18.794
We need your protection. The road is fell!

64
02:32:21.695 --> 02:32:22.995
I wish we may come with you.

65
02:32:23.395 --> 02:32:25.195
Please. understand. we need your support!

66
02:32:39.896 --> 02:32:41.896
I wish we may come with you.

67
02:32:44.597 --> 02:32:46.097
The road is very dangerous.

68
02:49:01.883 --> 02:49:04.083
You are being tracked.

69
02:50:56.494 --> 02:50:58.294
For her love...

70
02:50:58.993 --> 02:51:03.893
...I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish.

71
02:51:05.196 --> 02:51:09.696
I would have her leave these shores...

72
02:51:10.097 --> 02:51:13.297
...and be with her people.

73
02:51:14.996 --> 02:51:20.596
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

74
02:51:45.698 --> 02:51:47.598
Farewell.

75
02:51:51.099 --> 02:51:54.899
There is much you have yet to do.

76
02:51:56.599 --> 02:52:05.099
We shall not meet again. Elessar.

77
03:02:44.357 --> 03:02:47.857
They will fall
