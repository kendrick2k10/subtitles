00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.226
-Meagan.
-Not a school day.

4
00:01:01.312 --> 00:01:05.564
Oh. good morning to you. too.
Come on. come on. come on.

5
00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.234
We overslept. Kayla and Olivia
are gonna be here any minute.

6
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.904
Mom. why do I have to get stuck
with Olivia again?

7
00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:15.023
Why do you hate hanging out with
your little cousin so much?

8
00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:17.025
It's not even hanging out.
it's more like babysitting.

9
00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.119
And she's seven years old.

10
00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:21.863
Oh! Well. that's perfect.

11
00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:25.334
With all that experience. I can
hire you out as a babysitter.

12
00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.035
-Really?
-I could use the money.

13
00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:30.047
-Mom!
-Come on. let's go. Out!

14
00:01:31.342 --> 00:01:33.550
Sis. we're here.

15
00:01:41.352 --> 00:01:42.884
Hey...

16
00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:45.604
-Aunt Jada!
-Hey. little one.

17
00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:50.734
Olivia.
Meagan is dying to see you.

18
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:53.562
She's upstairs. Go on.

19
00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:55.989
Meagan. I'm here.

20
00:01:58.327 --> 00:01:59.618
Hey. sis.

21
00:02:01.372 --> 00:02:04.739
What's going on? You look tired.

22
00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:05.916
Now you know what you
looked like when

23
00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:08.127
you and Terrell got divorced.

24
00:02:08.212 --> 00:02:09.911
Damn. it's that kind of morning.

25
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.747
Just be glad that I'm movin' in
to my new place.

26
00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:14.249
Otherwise I might just move in
here with you.

27
00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:16.084
Oh. no. no. no. that settles it.

28
00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:19.087
Meagan and I will come to your
place and help your unpack.

29
00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:22.424
Tsk. No. for real.
I got it all under control.

30
00:02:22.518 --> 00:02:25.102
I'mma make everything real nice
for Olivia.

31
00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:26.937
A real ta-da moment.

32
00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:30.432
I'm gonna surprise her.

33
00:02:30.526 --> 00:02:33.101
What're you doin'? You know you
can't smoke that in the house.

34
00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:35.404
You really gonna just ruin
my one little ounce of fun?

35
00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:39.825
Come on. look at us.
we are two single moms

36
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.618
makin' things happen.

37
00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:43.287
You know what we should do?

38
00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:44.955
We should go
on some dating sites.

39
00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:46.373
switch off and compare guys

40
00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:47.833
like we used to do
in high school.

41
00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:49.117
-Yeah.

42
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:50.619
That's the last thing I need.

43
00:02:50.713 --> 00:02:52.454
Look at how well
that turned out for us.

44
00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:54.464
Why did we get married. again?

45
00:02:54.592 --> 00:02:56.884
You got married because
of that fireman's uniform.

46
00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:58.177
Don't let Warren dump all of

47
00:02:58.262 --> 00:03:01.013
the parenting responsibilities
on you.

48
00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:04.799
Why don't you go be me
and you tell that to Warren?

49
00:03:04.894 --> 00:03:07.394
He's reasonable. you know.
you just need to talk to him.

50
00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.971
That's how this thing works.

51
00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:13.066
It's not about you or him.
it's about Olivia.

52
00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:16.778
How's the job-hunt going?

53
00:03:16.864 --> 00:03:19.156
You know. it's all right.

54
00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:21.909
References. background checks.
everything's online.

55
00:03:21.994 --> 00:03:23.827
Some computer has decided
my fate.

56
00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:26.488
What I need
is a real-life interview.

57
00:03:26.582 --> 00:03:29.750
All someone needs to see
is my winning personality.

58
00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:31.993
Uh-huh.
it's not a beauty pageant.

59
00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:35.881
Well. speakin' of work. um...

60
00:03:40.638 --> 00:03:42.003
You got some money I could hold?

61
00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:44.673
-Kayla.
-Jada.

62
00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:48.176
You know I wouldn't ask you
if I didn't need it.

63
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.230
-It's for my new place.
-How much?

64
00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:55.567
-Two thousand.
-Two thousand?

65
00:03:55.653 --> 00:03:58.520
Look. it's for the first
and last month on the apartment.

66
00:03:58.614 --> 00:04:01.865
just until Warren's check comes
in. I'mma pay you right back.

67
00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:05.202
-I get his check on Friday.
-Okay. wait. wait. Look.

68
00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.747
How did you even get into
the apartment without a deposit?

69
00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.041
The manager helped us out.

70
00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:13.710
You know.
she was once a single mom.

71
00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:18.006
And I promised
I would pay her back... today.

72
00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:21.260
Kayla. how do you get yourself
into these situations?

73
00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:23.637
Asking you was hard enough
as it is. okay. Jada?

74
00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:26.265
Don't make me feel bad
about where I'm at right now.

75
00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:30.018
I'm trying.

76
00:04:30.104 --> 00:04:34.398
I'm doing much better than I
have been in a long. long time.

77
00:04:36.652 --> 00:04:39.569
You're my older sister. you're
supposed to look out for me.

78
00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:41.029
You're actually gonna pull the

79
00:04:41.115 --> 00:04:44.241
I'm-older-than-you-
by-97-seconds card?

80
00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:47.703
I'mma pay you back! I promise.

81
00:04:49.832 --> 00:04:51.873
I know things look bumpy
right now...

82
00:04:53.544 --> 00:04:55.585
but things are gonna get better.

83
00:05:01.677 --> 00:05:03.218
This is the last time.

84
00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.264
I love the way
you look out for me. sis.

85
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:08.682
Hm.

86
00:05:16.442 --> 00:05:17.858
I'll come drop her off
tomorrow.

87
00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:20.769
Nah. I'mma pick her up.

88
00:05:20.863 --> 00:05:22.738
It's not gonna take me that long
to put her room together.

89
00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:26.107
And I put her little dolly
in her backpack.

90
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.453
For the record.
I'm puttin' it back.

91
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.613
Don't flake out on me again.
okay?

92
00:05:31.707 --> 00:05:33.790
I have a lot of work to do
on Monday.

93
00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.376
I'll be back. I swear.

94
00:05:41.884 --> 00:05:43.675
Bye. sis.

95
00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:45.218
See you tomorrow.

96
00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.556
Mom. I'm gonna be late
for school.

97
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:56.805
We need all these
consolidated and compared

98
00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:58.857
against
the previous years' returns.

99
00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:01.234
I need this done at no later
than a week from Friday.

100
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.644
But the sooner. the better.

101
00:06:02.738 --> 00:06:04.279
-Obviously.
-Okay.

102
00:06:04.365 --> 00:06:07.115
Client's construction loan
depends on this.

103
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.370
Thank you again.

104
00:06:11.455 --> 00:06:13.538
You don't have to thank me
for anything.

105
00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:16.166
You've been great.
and it was time we rewarded you

106
00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:18.043
for your hard work.

107
00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.511
Hey. it's Kayla.

108
00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:30.180
You know what to do.

109
00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:31.673
Kayla. where are you?

110
00:06:31.767 --> 00:06:33.725
You said you were gonna be here
this morning.

111
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:40.273
Just call me.

112
00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:02.629
All right.
who's ready for school?

113
00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:05.039
-Hey. dad!
-Hi. kiddo.

114
00:07:05.134 --> 00:07:08.301
Olivia! What a nice surprise!

115
00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:11.888
On a school day.

116
00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:14.057
I thought we agreed we weren't
gonna allow bad influences

117
00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:15.517
around our daughter.

118
00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:18.812
She's seven years-old. Terrell.
she can hardly be

119
00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:20.647
considered a bad influence.

120
00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:25.360
You and I both know
I wasn't talking about Olivia.

121
00:07:25.446 --> 00:07:27.729
What'd she do.
come in here. dump her kid.

122
00:07:27.823 --> 00:07:29.990
ask for money
and take off again?

123
00:07:31.535 --> 00:07:33.785
She's my sister.
I'm not turning her away.

124
00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:35.704
Now. don't-don't.
don't turn this around. okay?

125
00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.414
She's not helpless.
and I don't want her

126
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:39.499
dumping her shit
on you and my daughter.

127
00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:42.544
Your daughter? Don't you mean
to say our daughter?

128
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:46.581
-Did you call Warren?
-No.

129
00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:49.584
I don't want to worry him
if I don't have to.

130
00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.761
You might not have a choice.

131
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:58.935
Hi. ma'am.

132
00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:32.928
Kayla.

133
00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:39.809
Damn it!

134
00:08:41.897 --> 00:08:44.022
I can't believe
you're doing this again.

135
00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:43.039
Okay. ladies.

136
00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.427
Daddy. daddy. I'm home.

137
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.686
-Oh. Olivia.

138
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.229
It's your dad.

139
00:10:07.024 --> 00:10:09.149
Go. go say hi.

140
00:10:15.157 --> 00:10:17.741
-Daddy!
-Whoa!

141
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.493
Oh! Hi!

142
00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:22.746
Where's mommy?

143
00:10:22.873 --> 00:10:25.749
Oh. sweetheart. you know
mommy has her own house now.

144
00:10:25.876 --> 00:10:28.168
-Remember?
-Take me there.

145
00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.295
Uh. come on. Olivia. I-I...

146
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.672
Uh. daddy has to go back
to work.

147
00:10:32.758 --> 00:10:35.300
I just came home
to get some clean clothes.

148
00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.177
I'm only stayin' for a minute.

149
00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.755
Where's Kayla?
She's avoiding me.

150
00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:42.974
And she hasn't answered
my calls or texts.

151
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.759
Join the club.

152
00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:47.062
When was the last time
you saw her?

153
00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:50.065
About a week ago. when she came
and got the last of her stuff.

154
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:54.110
I've had Olivia
since Saturday morning.

155
00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:55.987
Why didn't you call me sooner?

156
00:10:58.075 --> 00:11:01.776
Okay. Hey. why don't you go play
with your cousin. okay?

157
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.912
Come on. Olivia. let's go.

158
00:11:05.207 --> 00:11:07.782
Well. thank you
for watching Olivia.

159
00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:09.751
She needs her daddy.

160
00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:11.619
I know. I can't.

161
00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.380
I-I just came home
to get some clean clothes.

162
00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:15.006
I gotta head back
to the station.

163
00:11:15.092 --> 00:11:16.883
I'm on double shifts
till the end of the month.

164
00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:19.386
I told Kayla all of this.

165
00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:21.805
You think she's okay?

166
00:11:21.932 --> 00:11:24.015
I-I know she has her moments.

167
00:11:24.101 --> 00:11:26.634
but. I don't know.
this feels different.

168
00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.938
-I tried talking to her.
-Oh. Well. good luck with that.

169
00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:32.565
Kayla only does
what Kayla wants to do.

170
00:11:34.695 --> 00:11:38.646
-What about Gary? Tried him?
-No. not yet.

171
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.699
Hm. well the two of them
are probably off on a bender.

172
00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.492
-You don't know that.
-Oh. come on.

173
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:43.868
That guy is bad news.

174
00:11:43.954 --> 00:11:46.246
Even if she claims
she's in love with him.

175
00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:50.333
I'm sorry. Warren.

176
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.752
Well. she put us both
in a tight spot.

177
00:11:53.964 --> 00:11:56.005
You're doing me a huge favor.

178
00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:58.499
-Oh.
-A pizza.

179
00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:02.503
It's the least I can do.
Thanks. Jay.

180
00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:05.014
Hell. you know Kayla.
she'll show up in a day or two.

181
00:12:05.142 --> 00:12:08.009
all apologies and promises
for the next time.

182
00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:10.478
I don't know if I have
another next time in me.

183
00:12:10.564 --> 00:12:12.272
Hm.

184
00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:14.849
You call me
when she reaches out. okay?

185
00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:16.151
Same to you.

186
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:29.038
Hm?

187
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:32.709
Hey. you've reached Gary.

188
00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:34.702
I can't come to the phone right
now. Leave a message.

189
00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:38.381
Gary. it's Jada. Kayla's sister.
Uh. is she there with you?

190
00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:40.208
Could you just have her
call me back. ASAP?

191
00:12:40.302 --> 00:12:42.010
Is that my mom?

192
00:12:42.888 --> 00:12:44.888
Oh. no.

193
00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:47.515
When is she coming to get me?

194
00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:53.354
Well. your mommy is working
extra hard

195
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.774
to make your home
perfect for you.

196
00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:58.893
I'm not supposed to tell you
this 'cause it's a surprise.

197
00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:03.064
But she's painting your room
your favorite color.

198
00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:05.617
-Yellow?
-That's right.

199
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.329
Can I leave her a message?

200
00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:12.665
Of course.

201
00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:19.589
Hey. it's Kayla.

202
00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.549
You know what to do.

203
00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:23.009
Here.

204
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.259
Hey. mom. I got an A
on my spelling test today.

205
00:13:31.353 --> 00:13:33.770
Michelle Tolliver
was bugging me again.

206
00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:36.940
I told her to knock it off
or I'll tell Ms. Wayne.

207
00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:38.608
just like you told me to.

208
00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:42.028
When are you coming to get me?
I miss you. mom.

209
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.830
Uncuff him.

210
00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:54.541
I don't wanna see you back
in here. you understand?

211
00:13:56.253 --> 00:13:58.211
And don't think I'm not gonna
call in that favor.

212
00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:01.339
-You owe me.
-Yeah. no shit I do.

213
00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:18.857
Ms. Stallworth. Detective Hill.

214
00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:21.484
-Jada.
-Come back here with me.

215
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:25.738
Um. when was the last time
you saw your sister?

216
00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:28.649
Saturday morning. when
she dropped her daughter off.

217
00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.743
Today is Thursday.

218
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.079
You waited five days
to come in here?

219
00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:34.822
I wasn't sure.

220
00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:36.833
Or maybe you thought
she might be into something

221
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.377
you don't want the cops
to know nothin' about?

222
00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:42.163
No. I don't know what you mean.

223
00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:45.425
Does Kayla take off a lot?

224
00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:49.220
N-never. never for so long.

225
00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:51.014
Um. not when
I have her daughter.

226
00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:53.683
But she does take off.

227
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.009
I mean.
some-sometimes in the past.

228
00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.019
just for a couple of days.

229
00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:57.345
but I always hear from her.

230
00:14:57.439 --> 00:15:00.064
Mm-hmm.
And what about her daughter?

231
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.650
Do you have her still?

232
00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:05.686
Y-yes. um.
Warren's schedule is stacked.

233
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.363
so. you know.
she's still with me.

234
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.115
Who's Warren?

235
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.860
Uh. her father.

236
00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.195
I'm Detective Nichols.

237
00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:15.580
-Hi. nice to meet you.
-Please. sit.

238
00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:18.866
Um. that's her father.
uh. Warren Davis.

239
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.919
That's Kayla's ex.
or soon to be ex.

240
00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:23.796
They're getting a divorce.

241
00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:26.257
No. no. i-it's nothing
like that. they're friendly.

242
00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:28.426
I mean. I guess I-I shouldn't
say friendly. exactly.

243
00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:31.387
But everything's okay.

244
00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.890
Um. you can talk with him
if you need to.

245
00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:35.767
I will give you his number.

246
00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:38.227
Is there anywhere else
she could be?

247
00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:41.731
She has a new boyfriend.
um. Gary Burton.

248
00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:46.394
You don't like him.

249
00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:50.239
He can be a bad influence.

250
00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.575
She's been going out a lot
lately.

251
00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:55.787
Alcohol? Gambling? Drugs?

252
00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.206
-Drugs.
-That was in the past.

253
00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:01.000
You know. Kayla used to have
drug issues in the past.

254
00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:03.911
-So she could've relapsed.
-No! No!

255
00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:06.631
She wouldn't do that. she has
been clean for two years.

256
00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:09.133
She wouldn't go back.

257
00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.919
Kayla's a good person.

258
00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:14.514
We had a rough time growing up.
okay.

259
00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:18.259
o-our parents died in
a car crash when we were young.

260
00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:21.595
and. uh. Kayla had a hard time.
You know. it was a hard time.

261
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.272
Were there any thoughts

262
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.818
or signs of suicide?

263
00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:29.570
No! Never.
She would never do that.

264
00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.864
Not to Olivia.

265
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.783
I wrote her a check
that morning.

266
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.703
and she hasn't cashed it yet.

267
00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:40.448
Oh. We'll check her accounts.
her apartment.

268
00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:42.583
How much was the check for?

269
00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:45.461
Two-thousand dollars.

270
00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:48.956
Wow.
You're a nice sister.

271
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.926
Kayla's a good person.

272
00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:54.012
She's a wonderful mother.

273
00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:58.766
She's my best friend.

274
00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.687
When someone goes missing.

275
00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:05.023
it's hard for the people
closest to them

276
00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:07.859
to see what went wrong.
And that's where we come in.

277
00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.986
If something happened to Kayla.

278
00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:12.480
we're gonna do our best
to figure it out.

279
00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:16.451
But I've learned through
a lot of these cases

280
00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:19.153
that sometimes.
most of the time.

281
00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:21.497
the person doesn't wanna
come home.

282
00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:30.548
What makes you think
Kayla's using again?

283
00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:32.842
Her new boyfriend's
a junkie ass-wipe.

284
00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:35.053
Gary Burton?

285
00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:39.891
Were drugs a problem
in the marriage?

286
00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:41.434
Off and on.

287
00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.728
Uh. she's been clear
for a few years now.

288
00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:47.848
She had a-a friend who OD'd.
uh. knocked some sense into her.

289
00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:49.025
For a little while. anyway.

290
00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:51.027
Who filed for divorce?

291
00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.237
-Kayla.
-Don't you hate that?

292
00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:55.740
Oh. our marriage was over
a long time ago.

293
00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:58.367
This is just a formality.

294
00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:02.538
Jada said that. uh.
divorce has been amicable.

295
00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:05.500
Yeah. we're both trying
for Olivia.

296
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.460
You know of anyone
who'd wanna hurt Kayla?

297
00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:10.037
Not off hand.

298
00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:11.872
When was the last time
you saw her?

299
00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:15.510
Uh. it's been about
two weeks now.

300
00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.059
Look.
she's a irresponsible mother.

301
00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:26.562
and. yeah. we might not be
husband and wife anymore.

302
00:18:26.689 --> 00:18:30.891
-But I would never hurt her.
-Did I say you did?

303
00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:33.894
Just let me know
what you need from me

304
00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:35.696
to help find her.

305
00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:53.691
IT just sent over
Kayla's voice mails.

306
00:19:53.776 --> 00:19:55.234
And no one matching
her description has turned up

307
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.313
at any of the local hospitals
or the morgue.

308
00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:02.325
Kayla. it's Joyce.
I'm just checking in.

309
00:20:02.452 --> 00:20:04.744
Is everything okay?
Give me a call.

310
00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:07.455
Let me know everything's
all right. please?

311
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.123
Kayla. where are you?
You were supposed

312
00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:12.543
to be here this morning.
Turn that down!

313
00:20:12.629 --> 00:20:15.880
-Where are you? Call me!
-That's Jada.

314
00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:19.175
You goddamn bitch!
When I see you again...

315
00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.054
Hey. it's Warren.

316
00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.556
Jada came by the
house looking for you today.

317
00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:28.476
Everything okay?
Give me a call.

318
00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:37.610
Have we got any. um.
surveillance footage

319
00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:38.653
from the apartment yet?

320
00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:41.188
Mn-mn.

321
00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:44.242
Warren Davis' financials
don't raise any flags.

322
00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:48.871
No unusual debt.
sudden spending sprees.

323
00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:51.540
He has a modest life-insurance
policy through work

324
00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.918
and no policy on Kayla.

325
00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:56.370
Hm.

326
00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:58.923
Anything pop on the sister?

327
00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:01.425
Minor debt. Nothing major.

328
00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:07.715
I have a Joyce for you
in room A.

329
00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:09.183
Thank you.

330
00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:14.647
Thank you for coming.
Leave the door open.

331
00:21:14.732 --> 00:21:16.732
This isn't an interrogation.

332
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:19.402
Um. is Kayla okay?

333
00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:23.698
How would you describe Kayla's
relationship with her husband?

334
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.742
They were good together.

335
00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:29.745
Sonny and Cher good?
You're too young.

336
00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:31.872
Barack and Michelle good?

337
00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:35.793
Well. early on.

338
00:21:35.878 --> 00:21:40.506
But then I think
Warren got kind of fed up.

339
00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:44.969
Kayla started going out a lot.
Hooked up with Gary.

340
00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:49.140
She hooked up with Gary
before they separated?

341
00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:52.184
I guess.

342
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.602
I...

343
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.314
You know what. I-I'm not sure.

344
00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:59.433
M-maybe
I'm. uh. remembering it wrong.

345
00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:01.444
When was the last time
you saw Kayla?

346
00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:07.441
Maybe about... two months ago.

347
00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:09.994
Wow. Wow.

348
00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:13.080
That's a long time
for such a good friend.

349
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:19.787
Yeah. well. you. uh. add kids
in the mix.

350
00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:22.790
and hanging out
with your friends gets hard.

351
00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:25.301
No matter how close you are.

352
00:22:25.428 --> 00:22:29.797
You left a message for her.
You sounded very concerned.

353
00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:32.266
Was there something
in particular?

354
00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:36.020
Mn-mn.

355
00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:42.735
I told her I couldn't watch
Olivia all the time.

356
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.197
just for her to get drunk
and dance and party.

357
00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:48.741
-She didn't take that well.

358
00:22:53.373 --> 00:22:55.164
Mm.

359
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:56.791
Excuse us.

360
00:23:03.132 --> 00:23:06.333
They found Gary the boyfriend.

361
00:23:06.427 --> 00:23:08.511
Three guesses where he is.

362
00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:13.724
We just talked to Gary.

363
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:16.394
He's been in jail
since Friday the 9th.

364
00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:19.346
the night before
Kayla dropped off Olivia.

365
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.025
for a DUI he blames Kayla for.

366
00:23:23.152 --> 00:23:25.686
Left a nasty message.

367
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.072
Claims they had a fight
that night

368
00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:30.699
and he hasn't heard
from her since.

369
00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:34.120
-He could be lying.
-Could be.

370
00:23:34.205 --> 00:23:37.123
-But you don't think so?
-No. I don't think so.

371
00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:41.919
You haven't seen your sister
since when?

372
00:23:42.004 --> 00:23:44.713
Two weeks. But you know that.

373
00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:47.758
But you've been
to her apartment.

374
00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:50.219
-Sure. I guess.
-You have a key?

375
00:23:55.852 --> 00:23:57.810
Did she give you
that key?

376
00:23:57.895 --> 00:23:59.145
Huh?

377
00:24:04.944 --> 00:24:06.777
What is this?

378
00:24:06.863 --> 00:24:09.229
Is this what you've been doing?

379
00:24:09.323 --> 00:24:11.073
You're supposed to be trying
to find my sister.

380
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.785
Trying to find your sister
is exactly what we are doing.

381
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:16.370
Mrs. Stallworth.

382
00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:18.414
Now. do you wanna tell us
what you're doing

383
00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:19.907
sneaking into her apartment.

384
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:21.959
when she obviously
gave you a key?

385
00:24:22.044 --> 00:24:25.254
This is crazy!
What are you insinuating?

386
00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:28.415
Oh. this is some bullshit!

387
00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:31.427
No. no. no. this is a waste
of time. You've done nothing.

388
00:24:31.554 --> 00:24:32.928
I thought you were helping
my sister.

389
00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:34.805
Please. you know what?
You just get out!

390
00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:38.100
We found Kayla's car.
it was towed Friday night

391
00:24:38.227 --> 00:24:40.936
on the corner of 4th and 52nd.

392
00:24:41.063 --> 00:24:44.690
It was parked across from a
nightclub called Diamond Sky.

393
00:24:47.028 --> 00:24:48.319
Okay. so what now?

394
00:24:48.404 --> 00:24:50.938
Well. there's no evidence
of foul play.

395
00:24:51.032 --> 00:24:53.949
Of course. we'll run
all the tests. blood. DNA.

396
00:24:54.076 --> 00:24:55.943
drugs. semen.

397
00:24:56.037 --> 00:24:59.788
The good news is we have
the last location for her.

398
00:24:59.916 --> 00:25:01.457
It's a start.

399
00:25:01.584 --> 00:25:03.667
We do do our jobs.

400
00:25:03.753 --> 00:25:05.628
Just takes a little time.

401
00:25:05.755 --> 00:25:09.590
Now we head to that club
and start asking questions.

402
00:26:30.214 --> 00:26:31.797
Here you go.

403
00:26:33.217 --> 00:26:34.925
No. I'm good.

404
00:26:35.011 --> 00:26:37.553
About time you gave me
some attention.

405
00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:40.848
Excuse me?

406
00:26:43.144 --> 00:26:44.885
What?
You supposed to be somebody?

407
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:51.233
-You gonna act like that. Kayla?
-No. I'm not--

408
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.361
I mean. New Year's
you drank all my champagne.

409
00:26:57.491 --> 00:26:59.825
I've been trying to catch up
with you ever since.

410
00:27:16.344 --> 00:27:18.969
Mommy. Mommy.

411
00:27:20.848 --> 00:27:22.848
-Not--
-Do we get to stay home today?

412
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.979
Wait. Oh. my God!

413
00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:31.899
Okay.

414
00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.446
-Did you make your lunch?
-Yeah.

415
00:27:37.573 --> 00:27:38.864
Yeah? Okay.

416
00:27:40.076 --> 00:27:42.776
Hi. Eleanor.

417
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.745
Yes. I'm on my way.

418
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.873
You know. my daughter.
she was. um. up all night. sick.

419
00:27:47.958 --> 00:27:50.283
-No. I wasn't.
-Shh!

420
00:27:50.378 --> 00:27:53.545
Oh. thank you.
I will see you soon.

421
00:27:53.631 --> 00:27:55.089
Bye.

422
00:27:56.801 --> 00:27:57.966
Okay.

423
00:27:59.595 --> 00:28:02.462
Get your shoes on. grab Olivia.
Come on. we're late.

424
00:28:02.556 --> 00:28:04.223
We gotta go.
Hurry. hurry. hurry.

425
00:28:14.193 --> 00:28:16.610
Did you have the stats
for the Northfield project?

426
00:28:16.696 --> 00:28:20.313
I will get those to you
this afternoon.

427
00:28:20.408 --> 00:28:24.118
-I need that report. Jada.
-I know. I know. I'm sorry.

428
00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:25.744
I'll get it done.

429
00:28:36.757 --> 00:28:38.841
Detective Hill.
It's Jada. Calling for an--

430
00:28:38.968 --> 00:28:41.835
Ms. Stallworth. we don't have
anything new to tell you.

431
00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:45.180
And I know it doesn't look
like it. but we are working.

432
00:28:45.307 --> 00:28:47.683
We have to find out

433
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.395
what Kayla was doing.
what she was feeling.

434
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.180
recreate her steps.

435
00:28:53.274 --> 00:28:55.515
We have a 48-hour window

436
00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:57.901
from when you saw Kayla
on Saturday

437
00:28:57.987 --> 00:29:00.779
till Monday
when we found her car towed.

438
00:29:00.865 --> 00:29:03.365
It's my job
to shorten that window.

439
00:29:03.492 --> 00:29:05.200
to create a timeline.

440
00:29:05.327 --> 00:29:06.952
I have to talk to people.

441
00:29:07.037 --> 00:29:09.079
put pieces of the puzzle
together.

442
00:29:09.165 --> 00:29:11.248
You know. I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

443
00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:14.710
It's driving me crazy. so. um...

444
00:29:14.837 --> 00:29:16.920
What can I do? How can I help?

445
00:29:17.006 --> 00:29:19.757
Take care of your kid
and your niece.

446
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.368
Need a light?

447
00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:37.501
Kayla.

448
00:30:41.423 --> 00:30:43.632
I'm sorry.

449
00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:46.051
We know each other. don't we?

450
00:30:48.556 --> 00:30:50.389
See you inside.

451
00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:54.810
Shit.

452
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:14.913
Hey.

453
00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:17.332
Hey.

454
00:31:21.297 --> 00:31:22.880
Hey.

455
00:31:22.965 --> 00:31:24.998
Haven't seen you here
in a while.

456
00:31:25.092 --> 00:31:28.677
Yeah.
Like. what's it been. a week?

457
00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:30.012
What am I. a calendar?

458
00:31:30.139 --> 00:31:33.181
Hey. Mike. get her a drink.

459
00:31:35.185 --> 00:31:37.477
How was Roger's birthday?

460
00:31:38.647 --> 00:31:40.355
It was cool.

461
00:31:40.482 --> 00:31:43.066
Yeah? I heard you were feeling
no pain.

462
00:31:43.152 --> 00:31:44.568
Bump?

463
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:49.072
You know. I gotta pee in a cup.

464
00:31:49.158 --> 00:31:52.367
Oh! Who's got clean urine?

465
00:31:52.494 --> 00:31:55.528
Nobody in this joint.

466
00:32:02.504 --> 00:32:05.839
Hey. Mike. Roger around?

467
00:32:05.925 --> 00:32:10.210
No. Not since
his little birthday blowout.

468
00:32:10.304 --> 00:32:14.714
Man. I was so wasted.
I can't remember a thing!

469
00:32:14.808 --> 00:32:17.643
Well. that's a damn shame.
'cause I remember it.

470
00:32:17.728 --> 00:32:19.728
Hell. the whole damn bar
remembers.

471
00:32:19.855 --> 00:32:23.106
Yeah? Damn. it was like that?

472
00:32:23.192 --> 00:32:25.400
Well. it's good for business.

473
00:32:25.527 --> 00:32:28.904
Hey. how was. uh. Diamond Sky?

474
00:32:29.031 --> 00:32:32.407
It was cool.
I mean. actually it was a blur.

475
00:32:32.534 --> 00:32:34.067
Fill me in.

476
00:32:37.206 --> 00:32:38.956
Aw. man.

477
00:32:39.041 --> 00:32:42.909
-Did I leave my purse here?
-No. Hasn't shown up.

478
00:32:43.003 --> 00:32:44.169
I must've left it
at Diamond Sky.

479
00:32:44.254 --> 00:32:47.914
Damn! It's got all my shit
in it.

480
00:32:48.008 --> 00:32:50.300
Come on. help me out.
tell me when it was.

481
00:32:50.386 --> 00:32:52.427
Sunday. about three weeks back.

482
00:32:52.554 --> 00:32:54.262
-Three weeks back. Sunday.
-Yeah.

483
00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:56.056
Yeah. Thanks.

484
00:33:39.268 --> 00:33:42.185
Got a lot of nerve
comin' up in here. girl.

485
00:33:42.271 --> 00:33:43.979
Where my money?

486
00:33:44.106 --> 00:33:47.399
-Uh. I-I'll get it to you?
-Stop playin'.

487
00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:50.643
I gave you enough time
to figure that shit out.

488
00:33:50.738 --> 00:33:53.196
Listen! Shh. shh! Hear that?

489
00:33:53.282 --> 00:33:56.649
-The clock is tickin'.
-What do I owe you?

490
00:33:56.744 --> 00:33:58.660
You don't know
how much you owe me?

491
00:33:58.787 --> 00:34:01.246
Better stop
with them goddam games.

492
00:34:01.331 --> 00:34:04.416
2K. 2K. I'm gonna.
I'm gonna get it for you.

493
00:34:09.131 --> 00:34:11.048
You're a real bold one for
clicking your heels up in here.

494
00:34:11.133 --> 00:34:13.383
let me tell you that much.

495
00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:16.386
But I done ran out of patience.
Kayla.

496
00:34:16.472 --> 00:34:19.264
So that mean your stupid ass
ran out of time.

497
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:25.103
If I don't have my money
in the next 48 hours...

498
00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.691
Don't make me
finish that thought.

499
00:34:38.535 --> 00:34:39.367
Uh. she was
at The Pit Stop for some party

500
00:34:39.495 --> 00:34:40.786
for some guy named Roger.

501
00:34:40.871 --> 00:34:43.080
And then after that
she went to Diamond Sky

502
00:34:43.165 --> 00:34:44.289
and had an argument with Coogi.

503
00:34:44.374 --> 00:34:45.865
Now. Rochelle knows what
happened.

504
00:34:45.959 --> 00:34:46.875
but D-Roc and Payne--

505
00:34:47.002 --> 00:34:47.876
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

506
00:34:48.003 --> 00:34:50.212
Jada. take a moment.

507
00:34:50.339 --> 00:34:52.422
You know. your 48-hour timeline.

508
00:34:52.508 --> 00:34:54.707
I cut it down to 24.

509
00:34:54.802 --> 00:34:56.843
She was at The Pit Stop
on Sunday

510
00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.970
for a birthday party
for a guy named Roger.

511
00:34:59.056 --> 00:35:00.555
And then she went
to Diamond Sky--

512
00:35:00.682 --> 00:35:02.382
And you know all of this how?

513
00:35:02.476 --> 00:35:03.934
I got dressed up
in Kayla's clothes.

514
00:35:04.019 --> 00:35:05.936
-And I went to Buckhead.
-You did what?

515
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:08.105
Well. that's a great way
to get yourself killed.

516
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:11.149
-You needed a timeline.
-Yeah. for when you go missing.

517
00:35:11.235 --> 00:35:12.400
You know what you're doing?

518
00:35:12.528 --> 00:35:13.568
You're tampering with

519
00:35:13.695 --> 00:35:15.904
an ongoing missing person case.

520
00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:18.907
Dressing up. impersonating
the person that's missing

521
00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:21.243
is gonna ruin any chance we had

522
00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:22.911
at finding out
what happened to her.

523
00:35:23.038 --> 00:35:26.957
And I can arrest you
for impeding an investigation.

524
00:35:27.042 --> 00:35:29.960
You don't get to write her off.

525
00:35:30.045 --> 00:35:32.078
You got somethin' to say?

526
00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:35.423
I don't think you're taking
this investigation seriously.

527
00:35:35.551 --> 00:35:37.759
I think you need to go home.

528
00:35:40.556 --> 00:35:42.589
You said it yourself.

529
00:35:42.683 --> 00:35:44.266
People shut down
when they see cops. okay?

530
00:35:44.393 --> 00:35:48.261
They're talking to me! I'm
willing to do whatever it takes.

531
00:35:48.355 --> 00:35:51.273
-What are you willing to do?
-My job.

532
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.441
I'm willing to do my job.
and I suggest

533
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:56.319
you go to your office
and do yours.

534
00:35:56.405 --> 00:35:58.113
because you make
a very dangerous

535
00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.948
and negligent detective.

536
00:36:00.075 --> 00:36:03.785
My sister is in trouble!
I can feel it!

537
00:36:03.912 --> 00:36:07.205
So I'm gonna do whatever
it takes. You understand?

538
00:36:09.418 --> 00:36:13.253
You got to admit.
she's got a set on her.

539
00:36:13.338 --> 00:36:16.798
Yeah. but if somebody did do
something to her sister.

540
00:36:16.925 --> 00:36:19.259
she's settin' herself up
as a target.

541
00:36:27.436 --> 00:36:29.561
Look. look.
if you remember anything.

542
00:36:29.646 --> 00:36:31.897
you call me at that number.
okay?

543
00:36:56.632 --> 00:36:58.924
Damn. girl. where you been?

544
00:36:59.009 --> 00:37:01.051
Yeah. it feels like forever.
right. girl?

545
00:37:01.136 --> 00:37:03.637
Girl! Oh! You ready to party?

546
00:37:03.722 --> 00:37:05.680
After Roger's birthday.

547
00:37:05.807 --> 00:37:08.841
Filipo say
we could come by anytime.

548
00:37:08.936 --> 00:37:11.844
I was so wasted. you know.
I don't even remember.

549
00:37:11.939 --> 00:37:13.313
Like. tell me. what happened?

550
00:37:13.398 --> 00:37:17.350
Well. some crazy-ass shit!

551
00:37:17.444 --> 00:37:21.029
Filipo still talking
about that night. Mm-hmm.

552
00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:23.490
Why don't you call him.
tell him to come on out?

553
00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:25.367
You know.
I'll. I'll buy us drinks.

554
00:37:25.494 --> 00:37:28.119
Oh. yeah!
And dinner and a movie. too?

555
00:37:28.205 --> 00:37:31.531
-Come on. girl.
-Seriously.

556
00:37:31.625 --> 00:37:34.125
No. if Filipo saw Kayla
that night...

557
00:37:41.343 --> 00:37:45.053
You higher than me!
Bitch. you is crazy. man!

558
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.047
Come on in. get some of this.
Whoa. we better go. girl.

559
00:37:57.359 --> 00:38:01.194
Better watch your step.
You're in over your head.

560
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.489
I don't know who you think
you're foolin'.

561
00:38:04.574 --> 00:38:06.324
but it ain't me.

562
00:38:13.041 --> 00:38:17.002
Hey. Mike. You know
where Filipo is tonight?

563
00:38:17.087 --> 00:38:18.753
Who's Filipo?

564
00:38:21.883 --> 00:38:24.259
What the hell. Kayla!
You don't bail me out?

565
00:38:24.386 --> 00:38:26.344
You just blow me off?

566
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.054
Gary!

567
00:38:28.807 --> 00:38:30.056
Jay?

568
00:38:32.227 --> 00:38:35.395
Outside! Come on! Outside!

569
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.764
-Mm-hmm-hmm.
-Come on. let's go.

570
00:38:37.858 --> 00:38:40.317
Good luck with that one.

571
00:38:40.402 --> 00:38:43.445
Come on.
I'm not messin' with you.

572
00:38:51.288 --> 00:38:53.330
You got my sister using again.
didn't you?

573
00:38:53.415 --> 00:38:54.998
Well. nobody can make
your sister not do anything

574
00:38:55.083 --> 00:38:56.791
she doesn't wanna do.

575
00:38:56.918 --> 00:38:58.293
What the hell are you doing.
Jada?

576
00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.627
I'm trying to find her.

577
00:38:59.755 --> 00:39:01.755
She's been missing for weeks!

578
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.175
I guess that explains it.

579
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.012
What do you mean? When was
the last time you saw her?

580
00:39:09.097 --> 00:39:11.181
-Ask Warren.
-Warren?

581
00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:13.391
Kayla and I were havin'
a few drinks. you know.

582
00:39:13.477 --> 00:39:15.268
hangin' out.
and then Warren bust in.

583
00:39:15.354 --> 00:39:17.687
He's all pissed off.
they have a goddam fight

584
00:39:17.773 --> 00:39:20.607
and she leaves with him.

585
00:39:20.692 --> 00:39:23.309
-When-when was this?
-The night I got my DUI.

586
00:39:23.403 --> 00:39:24.944
It's her goddam fault!

587
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:27.530
-She was my ride!
-Why didn't you just...

588
00:39:27.616 --> 00:39:30.116
Why didn't you tell the cops
all this?

589
00:39:30.202 --> 00:39:32.202
You think I'm gonna get
in the middle of their shit?

590
00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:34.654
You know what.
she. when she comes back.

591
00:39:34.748 --> 00:39:36.498
you tell her we're done.

592
00:39:44.299 --> 00:39:48.218
-Oh.
-We need to talk. Jada.

593
00:39:48.303 --> 00:39:49.886
Um. I'll-I'll work
through lunch.

594
00:39:49.971 --> 00:39:52.472
It's been happening too often.

595
00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:54.507
-I-I can stay late tonight.
-No.

596
00:39:54.601 --> 00:39:56.810
The absenteeism.
the forgetfulness.

597
00:39:56.895 --> 00:39:58.520
the missed deadlines...

598
00:39:58.647 --> 00:40:00.522
I know that things.

599
00:40:00.649 --> 00:40:01.940
that things are not going well.
okay?

600
00:40:02.025 --> 00:40:04.818
But I-I can get it back
on track. I promise.

601
00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:06.611
I'm very sorry.

602
00:40:06.696 --> 00:40:09.280
I have no choice
but to let you go.

603
00:40:10.075 --> 00:40:11.408
No...

604
00:40:36.017 --> 00:40:37.767
It's open.

605
00:40:39.354 --> 00:40:41.104
Hey. aunty.
Hey. mom.

606
00:40:41.189 --> 00:40:42.730
We'll be in the backyard.

607
00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:45.567
Girls are back.

608
00:40:45.694 --> 00:40:46.943
I see that.

609
00:40:47.863 --> 00:40:50.447
Hey. uh...

610
00:40:50.532 --> 00:40:53.575
I really appreciate
you watching after Olivia.

611
00:40:56.037 --> 00:40:58.496
What?

612
00:40:58.582 --> 00:41:03.376
-You lied to me.
-What are you talking about?

613
00:41:03.462 --> 00:41:07.046
You said you hadn't seen Kayla
in a week.

614
00:41:07.132 --> 00:41:10.717
You saw her the night
before she dropped Olivia off.

615
00:41:12.053 --> 00:41:14.053
I had to hear that from Gary?

616
00:41:15.849 --> 00:41:17.348
Warren!

617
00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:22.353
-What was I gonna say?
-The truth!

618
00:41:23.315 --> 00:41:25.264
The truth? Yeah.

619
00:41:25.358 --> 00:41:28.401
That. uh. Kayla was supposed
to be home with Olivia?

620
00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:31.270
That instead.
she was out partying

621
00:41:31.364 --> 00:41:33.105
with her junkie boyfriend?

622
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.657
Again.

623
00:41:34.743 --> 00:41:38.244
That I had to chase her down
to some scumbag bar?

624
00:41:39.456 --> 00:41:40.955
Again.

625
00:41:46.546 --> 00:41:48.630
Yeah. I chased her down.

626
00:41:48.757 --> 00:41:52.592
I told Gary to get lost
and I told her to get in an Uber

627
00:41:52.677 --> 00:41:56.012
and handle her responsibilities.
to act like an adult for once.

628
00:41:56.097 --> 00:42:00.975
You waited days. Jada.
days. to go to the police.

629
00:42:01.102 --> 00:42:03.811
Don't pretend like
you don't understand.

630
00:42:03.939 --> 00:42:05.522
Of course. I do.

631
00:42:05.607 --> 00:42:07.398
You didn't wanna get her
in trouble. either.

632
00:42:07.484 --> 00:42:09.859
So-so-so what?
I-I should've told the police?

633
00:42:09.945 --> 00:42:11.236
No.

634
00:42:12.781 --> 00:42:14.656
But you should have told me.

635
00:42:17.285 --> 00:42:19.035
I think she's dead.

636
00:42:19.955 --> 00:42:21.454
Don't say that.

637
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:23.706
Don't say that.

638
00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:28.461
I just...

639
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:31.381
I miss her so much.

640
00:42:36.596 --> 00:42:38.012
You can try it.

641
00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:55.113
Hey. cutie pies. Y'all gonna let
me help you out with your game?

642
00:42:57.742 --> 00:42:59.158
The secret is...

643
00:43:00.203 --> 00:43:01.411
bend your knees.

644
00:43:12.507 --> 00:43:14.215
Shoot it. shoot it.

645
00:43:16.011 --> 00:43:17.635
-I got it.

646
00:43:21.725 --> 00:43:24.100
Hey!
Get the hell away from them!

647
00:43:26.354 --> 00:43:28.104
Go! Go back!

648
00:43:28.189 --> 00:43:29.647
What's wrong with you?
Coming to my home?

649
00:43:29.733 --> 00:43:32.984
I said 48 hours.
And you know I don't play.

650
00:43:35.322 --> 00:43:39.065
Look! This is all I have. okay?
Okay. just take it.

651
00:43:39.159 --> 00:43:43.411
What-what... What am I supposed
to do with this?

652
00:43:43.538 --> 00:43:45.913
You. like. 19 short.
shorty.

653
00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:48.958
Just get the hell out of here.

654
00:43:49.044 --> 00:43:52.411
-Go on.
-Oh. you the sister. right?

655
00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:54.672
Yeah. you gonna take
all that make-up off.

656
00:43:54.758 --> 00:43:58.134
come in here. put your little
housewife clothes on...

657
00:43:58.219 --> 00:44:00.678
Kayla got you picking up
all her mess. right?

658
00:44:00.764 --> 00:44:02.347
She is savage.

659
00:44:04.434 --> 00:44:06.476
When was the last time
you saw her?

660
00:44:11.274 --> 00:44:12.690
What's going on?

661
00:44:16.738 --> 00:44:19.530
I don't give a shit who pay me.

662
00:44:19.616 --> 00:44:21.616
I want my money.

663
00:44:23.703 --> 00:44:25.411
Jada. what the hell is going on?

664
00:44:32.629 --> 00:44:34.787
-What are you doing back?
-I got Jax to cover for me.

665
00:44:34.881 --> 00:44:36.622
I was worried about you.

666
00:44:36.716 --> 00:44:38.633
Why didn't you tell me
any of this?

667
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.793
Because I knew
you'd try to talk me out of it.

668
00:44:40.887 --> 00:44:44.639
Yeah! You can get
yourself killed. Jada.

669
00:44:44.766 --> 00:44:46.641
So I've heard.

670
00:44:46.768 --> 00:44:49.143
You could get
our daughter killed.

671
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:51.437
A drug dealer just left here.

672
00:44:52.982 --> 00:44:54.807
Now look.
I'm gonna get the money

673
00:44:54.901 --> 00:44:56.642
and I'm gonna pay him back.
He's not gonna come back.

674
00:44:56.736 --> 00:44:58.695
This isn't just about him.

675
00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.988
You got to stop
going to these clubs.

676
00:45:01.116 --> 00:45:04.367
You got to let the police
do their job. Stay out of it.

677
00:45:04.452 --> 00:45:07.704
I can't just sit around
and wait. Terrell.

678
00:45:07.789 --> 00:45:10.164
It's not like I have a job
anyway. I have the time.

679
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:11.874
You lost your job?

680
00:45:17.006 --> 00:45:18.631
This is crazy.

681
00:45:20.927 --> 00:45:24.178
I'm gonna shut
all this down. now.

682
00:45:24.305 --> 00:45:26.889
You're a mother
and you have responsibilities.

683
00:45:32.981 --> 00:45:36.232
Pay that guy off
and shut all this down now.

684
00:45:36.317 --> 00:45:39.026
Or we need to talk about
who has custody of Meagan.

685
00:45:50.582 --> 00:45:52.373
Hey.

686
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.708
Bring it up.

687
00:45:59.841 --> 00:46:02.041
What happened
after Roger's birthday?

688
00:46:02.135 --> 00:46:04.552
What are you talking about?

689
00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:08.097
I can't remember.
Just tell me what happened.

690
00:46:09.684 --> 00:46:13.102
So nobody's got anything to say?

691
00:46:13.188 --> 00:46:16.388
Cops came by here
looking for you today.

692
00:46:16.483 --> 00:46:19.609
Or should I say
they were looking for Kayla?

693
00:46:23.448 --> 00:46:25.615
-Who the hell are you?

694
00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.743
Are you an informant? A narc?

695
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:31.454
Okay. wait. wait. wait!
Look. look. I'm-I'm....

696
00:46:32.373 --> 00:46:33.998
I'm Kayla's twin sister.

697
00:46:34.083 --> 00:46:36.793
And she went missing. Okay?

698
00:46:36.878 --> 00:46:39.629
Look. I know. I know
she was at Roger's birthday

699
00:46:39.714 --> 00:46:43.966
and then.
and she never came home. Okay?

700
00:46:44.052 --> 00:46:46.886
Someone here knows something.

701
00:46:50.558 --> 00:46:53.309
Y'all are supposed to be
her friends!

702
00:46:53.394 --> 00:46:55.520
Why can't you just tell me
what happened?

703
00:47:01.402 --> 00:47:04.028
Who is Filipo? Huh?

704
00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:11.610
I will never stop looking
for her. You understand me?

705
00:47:11.704 --> 00:47:14.956
Never! And I will find her.

706
00:47:15.083 --> 00:47:17.783
God. so help me. if I have
to bring the cops here

707
00:47:17.877 --> 00:47:20.962
and bring them down
on all of you. I will do it!

708
00:47:49.409 --> 00:47:51.317
You just couldn't
leave it alone. huh?

709
00:47:51.411 --> 00:47:52.493
No...

710
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.837
You wanna know
what happened to your sister?

711
00:48:12.432 --> 00:48:13.848
Coming or what?

712
00:48:44.213 --> 00:48:45.379
Let's go.

713
00:49:06.194 --> 00:49:08.945
Yo. let's go.
Filipo's in the back.

714
00:49:45.566 --> 00:49:47.692
Your sister's missing.

715
00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:56.993
She's good people.

716
00:50:00.498 --> 00:50:04.375
You saw her
the night of Roger's party?

717
00:50:06.713 --> 00:50:10.089
Was she looking to score?
Did-did you give her drugs?

718
00:50:14.887 --> 00:50:18.347
-I'm gonna call the police.
-Ain't no one going to the cops.

719
00:50:20.101 --> 00:50:22.518
You only here
'cause I like your sister.

720
00:50:22.603 --> 00:50:25.896
Yeah? Well. if you like her
so much...

721
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:31.027
then why didn't you tell anybody
when you heard she was missing?

722
00:50:31.112 --> 00:50:33.404
What the hell
is wrong with you?

723
00:50:35.158 --> 00:50:36.323
She's a mother.

724
00:50:38.119 --> 00:50:41.153
She's got
a beautiful little girl at home

725
00:50:41.247 --> 00:50:44.165
who loves her
and depends on her.

726
00:50:45.251 --> 00:50:46.584
Please...

727
00:50:48.129 --> 00:50:50.046
tell me what happened.

728
00:50:51.299 --> 00:50:53.674
Said he was her husband.

729
00:50:53.801 --> 00:50:55.885
Wait. Warren was there?

730
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:59.180
Me and my girlfriend
went to his place. with Kayla.

731
00:51:00.767 --> 00:51:02.725
And-and then what did you do?

732
00:51:05.146 --> 00:51:06.604
Hung out.

733
00:51:08.066 --> 00:51:09.857
Partied.

734
00:51:09.984 --> 00:51:12.276
Kayla was acting kinda slow.

735
00:51:13.362 --> 00:51:15.029
Didn't look right.

736
00:51:16.491 --> 00:51:18.324
Not her usual self.

737
00:51:19.327 --> 00:51:22.203
-What?
-She got dosed.

738
00:51:25.458 --> 00:51:27.124
Then what happened?

739
00:51:28.461 --> 00:51:31.796
We left. She stayed.

740
00:51:31.881 --> 00:51:33.964
Figured she'd sleep it off.

741
00:51:37.345 --> 00:51:40.930
So you knew Kayla was drugged.

742
00:51:41.015 --> 00:51:43.849
then you heard she went missing.
and you didn't say anything.

743
00:51:43.935 --> 00:51:45.935
Hey. I'm telling you now.

744
00:51:48.189 --> 00:51:51.482
Our business is done.
Get your ass up out of here.

745
00:51:53.486 --> 00:51:54.902
Let's go.

746
00:53:36.214 --> 00:53:39.048
The check I gave Kayla.

747
00:55:42.131 --> 00:55:43.297
Hello?

748
00:55:45.051 --> 00:55:48.093
No. Just home for a bit.
Forgot my wallet.

749
00:55:48.929 --> 00:55:51.221
I'm fine. mom.

750
00:55:51.307 --> 00:55:53.849
Yeah. Olivia's fine. too.

751
00:55:53.934 --> 00:55:56.301
With Jada.

752
00:55:56.395 --> 00:55:57.853
Mom. I'm not happy
about it either.

753
00:55:57.938 --> 00:55:59.313
but I don't have
much of a choice.

754
00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.140
not while I'm working
these doubles.

755
00:56:02.234 --> 00:56:04.693
Thinking about
transferring to Phoenix.

756
00:56:04.779 --> 00:56:06.653
taking Olivia with me.

757
00:56:06.781 --> 00:56:09.314
Yeah. mom. you're coming. too.

758
00:56:09.408 --> 00:56:12.576
Look. you gotta let me go. I got
to get back to the station.

759
00:56:13.746 --> 00:56:15.829
Okay. Bye.

760
00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:05.254
The kids are coming
with me. Jada.

761
00:57:13.848 --> 00:57:15.514
I was right.

762
00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.279
I found it at Warren's place.

763
00:57:30.364 --> 00:57:33.031
-Holy shit.
-All this time.

764
00:57:34.535 --> 00:57:36.076
He lives right there.

765
00:57:37.371 --> 00:57:39.288
We've gotta go to the police.

766
00:57:42.209 --> 00:57:44.084
What do you mean. "We?"

767
00:57:45.754 --> 00:57:49.006
I'm coming with you. okay?

768
00:57:49.091 --> 00:57:51.717
Okay? Hey. hey. hey.
it's okay.

769
00:57:51.802 --> 00:57:53.251
Are the girls asleep?

770
00:57:53.345 --> 00:57:54.928
Don't worry about them.
it's okay.

771
00:57:55.055 --> 00:57:56.805
I'll call the babysitter
and make sure they can come.

772
00:57:56.891 --> 00:57:59.975
-Baby. Baby?
-What did he do?

773
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.811
Baby... Babe.

774
00:58:07.568 --> 00:58:09.401
Middle of the night.
Jada.

775
00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:18.160
So. what's the news?

776
00:58:22.917 --> 00:58:24.541
Here you go. Jada.

777
00:58:29.006 --> 00:58:30.714
It's okay. babe.

778
00:58:34.094 --> 00:58:36.795
So now can you tell us
what you saw?

779
00:58:36.889 --> 00:58:39.464
I hid under the desk

780
00:58:39.558 --> 00:58:42.809
and I found the check
that I wrote to Kayla...

781
00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.480
in his drawer.

782
00:58:46.607 --> 00:58:50.526
This proves that he saw her
after she left me.

783
00:58:58.118 --> 00:58:59.451
He's lying!

784
00:59:03.624 --> 00:59:05.332
Let's search the place.

785
00:59:07.127 --> 00:59:10.420
I'm sorry. Jada.
We need a warrant first.

786
00:59:10.506 --> 00:59:12.214
Give us 24 hours.

787
00:59:32.486 --> 00:59:34.528
This is a bad idea.

788
00:59:36.907 --> 00:59:38.073
Jada?

789
00:59:39.034 --> 00:59:40.242
Jada!

790
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:43.287
Come or go.

791
00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:46.415
Let's wait.

792
00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:48.750
We don't know what we may find.

793
00:59:48.836 --> 00:59:50.335
I don't want Warren
destroying anything

794
00:59:50.421 --> 00:59:53.130
while we wait for those
detectives to get a warrant.

795
00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.096
We're in!

796
01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:08.705
Terrell.

797
01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.208
Terrell?

798
01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:15.212
Terrell? Terrell?

799
01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:19.049
Terrell! Terrell!

800
01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:20.926
Terrell. Here.

801
01:01:47.413 --> 01:01:49.579
She's...

802
01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:05.762
This is your proof.
Go arrest him!

803
01:02:05.848 --> 01:02:08.473
Damn it. Jada.
you were told to stand down.

804
01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:10.842
I am two seconds away
from arresting you

805
01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:12.018
for interfering
with an investigation.

806
01:02:12.146 --> 01:02:13.344
You are just mad

807
01:02:13.439 --> 01:02:15.346
because I am doing your job.
okay.

808
01:02:15.441 --> 01:02:17.315
and I'm finding things
that you didn't!

809
01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:21.695
A bloody piece of fabric is not
enough to get an arrest warrant.

810
01:02:21.822 --> 01:02:23.238
What more do you need?

811
01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:25.574
That's Kayla's blood!

812
01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:30.036
This is just one case to you.
Just some other case. Right?

813
01:02:30.164 --> 01:02:31.872
Just one more loose end
before you retire

814
01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:33.865
to some beach in Florida.

815
01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:36.585
She does not care
about finding Kayla. okay?

816
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:39.370
-She never did.
-All right. all right.

817
01:02:39.465 --> 01:02:41.214
You're just doing
what you need to do to get by

818
01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:43.508
so you can pass her off
to someone else.

819
01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:45.886
Don't you dare.

820
01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:49.380
I put a hundred percent
into any case I work.

821
01:02:49.475 --> 01:02:52.717
No shortcuts.
no passing the buck.

822
01:02:52.811 --> 01:02:55.020
You don't think
I know how you're feeling.

823
01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:56.855
what you're going through?

824
01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:01.443
This picture was taken
in California

825
01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:03.895
15 years ago.

826
01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:06.948
That's the last time
I saw my wife.

827
01:03:07.034 --> 01:03:10.911
She was on
some team-building retreat.

828
01:03:11.038 --> 01:03:14.247
She called me
the day that photo was taken.

829
01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:17.459
and no one saw her
after that night.

830
01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:19.169
That's why I haven't retired.

831
01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:22.580
'cause I'm not giving up
on searching for her

832
01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:25.416
and I'm not giving up
on your sister.

833
01:03:25.511 --> 01:03:29.846
I understand the helplessness.

834
01:03:29.932 --> 01:03:31.807
the frustration.

835
01:03:31.892 --> 01:03:35.685
I know
it doesn't feel like justice.

836
01:03:35.771 --> 01:03:38.146
But we're gonna catch
that son of a bitch.

837
01:03:38.232 --> 01:03:40.941
I'm not gonna stop until we do.

838
01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:44.694
And when we do.
we have to keep him caught.

839
01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:48.657
I need you to listen
to me carefully.

840
01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:54.120
No more running around
playing vigilante.

841
01:03:54.248 --> 01:03:56.164
no more dressing up.

842
01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:59.292
I need you to stand down
and stand back

843
01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:02.504
and let us do our jobs.

844
01:04:05.217 --> 01:04:07.676
I'm serious. Jada.

845
01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:09.803
We'll test the blood.

846
01:04:14.268 --> 01:04:15.300
I know
you don't wanna hear this.

847
01:04:15.394 --> 01:04:17.468
but Detective Hill's right.

848
01:04:17.563 --> 01:04:19.563
You have to back off
and let them do their job.

849
01:04:19.648 --> 01:04:24.359
It's not good for you. it's not
good for our daughter or us.

850
01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:28.989
I want them to do their job.

851
01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:36.079
Terrell. I'm exhausted.

852
01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:38.081
Do you want me to come in?

853
01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:40.792
Hey.

854
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:45.171
I'm o... I'm okay.

855
01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:50.668
Really. Really.

856
01:04:50.762 --> 01:04:52.971
Okay. Promise me
you'll get some sleep.

857
01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:56.141
I promise.

858
01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:56.409
Kayla.

859
01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:58.536
What the hell
are you doing here?

860
01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:01.623
-I just need--
-Please.

861
01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:05.293
Tell me. enlighten me.
what do you need?

862
01:06:05.379 --> 01:06:09.464
Hey. you can just show up.
after all these weeks?

863
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:11.091
Just like that?

864
01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:25.063
I need help. Warren.

865
01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.439
You always need something.

866
01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:31.319
You know. your daughter
needs her mother.

867
01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:35.824
Yeah. I. I miss her.

868
01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:40.036
Your sister...
has cops looking for you.

869
01:06:40.122 --> 01:06:42.998
She's convinced you're dead.

870
01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:49.713
I need money.

871
01:07:01.101 --> 01:07:03.476
-Hill.
-Detective.

872
01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:07.522
Um. Jada's not home.

873
01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:09.858
I dropped her off earlier. uh.
she said she was going to bed.

874
01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:13.570
But I'm here now.
and. uh. she's not here.

875
01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:15.196
I'm afraid she's gone
to Warren's.

876
01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:16.740
I'm headed there now.

877
01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.870
Heard about the $2.000.

878
01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:27.167
Yeah. it wasn't enough.
I mean...

879
01:07:29.421 --> 01:07:31.212
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

880
01:07:34.301 --> 01:07:35.967
I need help.

881
01:07:43.477 --> 01:07:46.978
Come here. baby.
Dance with me.

882
01:07:48.148 --> 01:07:50.190
Come on. like we used to.

883
01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:57.864
No. I don't. Look...

884
01:07:57.991 --> 01:08:00.492
This. this isn't
what I came here for.

885
01:08:02.788 --> 01:08:04.162
Isn't it?

886
01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.533
You-you know. Coogi.
he says that--

887
01:08:08.627 --> 01:08:10.668
I-I should have let him
handle it.

888
01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:15.131
Wait. what did you just say?

889
01:08:19.513 --> 01:08:21.429
-Answer me.

890
01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:26.893
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

891
01:08:35.529 --> 01:08:37.061
My sister was right.

892
01:08:37.155 --> 01:08:39.197
You're nothing
but a piece of trash.

893
01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:41.157
You really wanna go there?

894
01:08:41.243 --> 01:08:42.733
You really wanna start
throwing those stones.

895
01:08:42.828 --> 01:08:45.570
talking about
who broke whose promises?

896
01:08:45.664 --> 01:08:47.455
Who put who out in the cold?

897
01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:48.915
What did you mean when you said

898
01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:50.959
you should have let him
handle it?

899
01:08:52.546 --> 01:08:54.838
Well. if I had left
well enough alone.

900
01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:57.632
Coogi would have taken care
of everything.

901
01:08:57.717 --> 01:09:00.751
Either that. or the needle
would have killed your sister.

902
01:09:00.846 --> 01:09:02.753
I can't believe
you broke in here.

903
01:09:04.766 --> 01:09:06.432
This? Hm. here.

904
01:09:12.983 --> 01:09:15.275
-You bastard.

905
01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.278
You killed her?

906
01:09:18.405 --> 01:09:20.029
Look at me!

907
01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:26.494
What are you gonna do. Jada?
Go to the police?

908
01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:29.497
What proof do you have?

909
01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:34.952
Oh. Is this what you want?

910
01:09:35.046 --> 01:09:37.881
Oh. no. no. no. Uh-uh.

911
01:10:14.628 --> 01:10:17.503
Oh. she's crazy!
She attacked me!

912
01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:20.798
She broke into my house.
pretending to be my wife!

913
01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:22.967
He did it.
He confessed to killing Kayla.

914
01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:25.720
-You tell Detective Hill that.
-Yes. ma'am.

915
01:10:28.308 --> 01:10:30.850
She's the criminal.
She's crazy.

916
01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:36.689
So let me paint
the picture.

917
01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:38.683
A jealous husband hates the idea

918
01:10:38.777 --> 01:10:40.685
of losing control of his wife
so much

919
01:10:40.779 --> 01:10:44.155
that when she finally
got the courage to leave him.

920
01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:45.740
he kills her.

921
01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.194
Now you're just making stuff up.

922
01:10:50.288 --> 01:10:52.580
I mean. even I've seen
enough episodes of Law & Order

923
01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:54.332
to know you got nothing.

924
01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:58.419
Where's the body?

925
01:10:58.505 --> 01:11:01.005
I mean. who. who says
she's even dead?

926
01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:05.760
Here's the truth.

927
01:11:06.805 --> 01:11:09.305
Kayla is an absentee mother.

928
01:11:09.391 --> 01:11:13.384
a drug addict. who hangs out in
bars with junkies and lowlifes.

929
01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:15.853
We have eyewitness testimony

930
01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:18.773
that you were getting
physically abusive.

931
01:11:23.655 --> 01:11:26.072
Are there any hospital records?

932
01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:28.733
I mean. you guys are the cops.
Are there any police reports?

933
01:11:28.827 --> 01:11:31.911
DNA results should be in
in a couple of days.

934
01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:33.746
That. and Jada's statement
should be enough

935
01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:36.741
for a jury to convict.

936
01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:41.004
Of what?
That my wife slept in our bed?

937
01:11:41.089 --> 01:11:44.299
A little blood
at that time of the month?

938
01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:49.929
There's way too much blood
for that time of the month.

939
01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:51.264
Hm.

940
01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:57.812
Either arrest me
and get me a lawyer...

941
01:11:57.897 --> 01:11:59.939
or I'm due back at the station.

942
01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:06.321
Sit tight.

943
01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.969
He's right.
we can't hold him much longer

944
01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:31.929
without contacting his lawyer.

945
01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:33.514
You and I both know
there is enough blood

946
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.682
on that mattress to--

947
01:12:34.768 --> 01:12:36.476
I agree. but right now

948
01:12:36.603 --> 01:12:38.353
it's his word against her word.

949
01:12:38.438 --> 01:12:41.022
We need those DNA results back.

950
01:12:52.077 --> 01:12:55.453
You get your wish.
Call your lawyer.

951
01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:20.580
-Warren.

952
01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:24.500
They let you go?

953
01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:28.421
My lawyer got me out
with a phone call.

954
01:14:28.548 --> 01:14:31.924
Look. you-you-you leave.
and I won't call the police.

955
01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:34.886
Oh. well. I'm not going anywhere
without Olivia.

956
01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:39.140
All I wanted is my family.

957
01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:42.477
I earned that.
I worked hard for that.

958
01:14:42.562 --> 01:14:45.104
The why'd you
kill my sister?

959
01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:47.932
-Kayla just...
-Answer me!

960
01:14:48.026 --> 01:14:50.601
I mean. she. she did her best
to ruin that.

961
01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:53.270
Drugs and-and partying
and a-anyone

962
01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:55.490
who would offer her either.

963
01:14:55.575 --> 01:14:58.117
When I said I loved her...

964
01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:00.828
I meant it.

965
01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:04.949
And we. we were supposed
to work. y-you know.

966
01:15:05.043 --> 01:15:09.337
we-we-we were sup... supposed
to be forever.

967
01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:11.964
She owed me.

968
01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:15.218
I pulled her out of the gutter
even when you couldn't save her.

969
01:15:16.971 --> 01:15:19.805
And I did.
I-I. I-I gave her everything.

970
01:15:19.933 --> 01:15:21.891
I-I. I even gave her the money

971
01:15:21.976 --> 01:15:25.228
to continue
her disgusting habits.

972
01:15:25.313 --> 01:15:27.396
And how does she repay me?

973
01:15:28.358 --> 01:15:30.942
You don't threaten a man.

974
01:15:32.403 --> 01:15:35.154
You don't disrespect a man.

975
01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:37.490
not in his own home.

976
01:15:37.617 --> 01:15:39.575
You-you made a vow.

977
01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:42.495
Till death do us part.

978
01:15:43.957 --> 01:15:45.915
-You are mine.
-No! No!

979
01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:16.112
-Daddy!

980
01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:17.780
Olivia!

981
01:16:26.124 --> 01:16:29.166
Get back!
Go back upstairs!

982
01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:54.609
No. this is bullshit!

983
01:16:54.694 --> 01:16:57.570
-She's crazy!

984
01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:04.827
It's over. Jada.
We got him.

985
01:17:06.581 --> 01:17:08.405
There's no way
he isn't locked up.

986
01:17:08.499 --> 01:17:10.708
He's going away
for attempted murder.

987
01:17:26.601 --> 01:17:28.267
The girls asleep?

988
01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:30.478
Washed. brushed
and put away clean.

989
01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:34.565
When are you going out of town?

990
01:17:36.736 --> 01:17:38.152
I'm not.

991
01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:43.282
Quitting the road.
For good this time.

992
01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:48.454
They offered me a desk job
at the label. and I'm taking it.

993
01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:52.083
There's too much going on.
And I wanna be around my girls.

994
01:17:54.754 --> 01:17:57.454
I'm sorry about everything.
okay? I...

995
01:17:57.548 --> 01:17:59.799
Don't be. Okay?

996
01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:06.138
I'll be right here
until you fall asleep.

997
01:18:07.934 --> 01:18:09.308
Thank you.

998
01:18:31.916 --> 01:18:33.332
Three months.
Where?

999
01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:34.709
Here. Three months.

1000
01:18:34.794 --> 01:18:37.503
All I need is some pregnant kid

1001
01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:40.464
waitin' on me when I get home.

1002
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:42.258
I don't even know what...

1003
01:18:43.803 --> 01:18:49.173
-Hey.
-Can I help you?

1004
01:18:49.267 --> 01:18:52.184
This is the guy
I was telling you about.

1005
01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:57.014
So. uh.
you can help me with my problem?

1006
01:18:57.108 --> 01:19:00.943
If the money's right. my people
can do whatever you need.

1007
01:19:02.321 --> 01:19:05.072
Well. I can't have her testify.

1008
01:19:05.158 --> 01:19:06.824
How do you want it done?

1009
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:11.162
Well. as long
as there's no body.

1010
01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:12.872
I really don't give a shit
how it's done.

1011
01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:14.457
I need it done soon.

1012
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.009
Warren.
somebody here to see you.

1013
01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:32.516
Expecting your lawyer?

1014
01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:38.397
What do you want?

1015
01:19:40.026 --> 01:19:43.110
You know. I was always so upset.

1016
01:19:43.196 --> 01:19:45.654
always so worried about Kayla...

1017
01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.283
who she was with.

1018
01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:52.620
what her drug of choice was
for the week.

1019
01:19:52.705 --> 01:19:55.748
I thought you were good for her.

1020
01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:58.083
grounded her.

1021
01:19:58.211 --> 01:20:01.086
It never crossed my mind
she was doing all of that

1022
01:20:01.214 --> 01:20:04.081
to escape you.

1023
01:20:04.175 --> 01:20:08.135
Kayla was a junkie whore
long before I met her.

1024
01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:10.805
The outcome would have been
the same regardless.

1025
01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:13.924
She had it coming.

1026
01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:16.769
Well. at least
you can't hurt her anymore...

1027
01:20:17.897 --> 01:20:19.096
or Olivia.

1028
01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:21.982
No. Olivia is my daughter.

1029
01:20:22.068 --> 01:20:23.609
And when I get out of here.
you are never

1030
01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:25.820
going to be allowed near her.

1031
01:20:25.905 --> 01:20:29.281
You are never getting
out of here. you son of a bitch.

1032
01:20:47.593 --> 01:20:49.802
You are gonna rot in here

1033
01:20:49.929 --> 01:20:53.430
for the rest
of your miserable life.

1034
01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:18.038
Seven. eight.

1035
01:21:18.124 --> 01:21:20.490
nine. ten.

1036
01:21:20.585 --> 01:21:22.492
Olivia? Where is she?

1037
01:21:22.587 --> 01:21:24.712
-Here I am!

1038
01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:26.997
Here you are!
Ah. there you are!

1039
01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:30.676
Oh! Darling.

1040
01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:34.388
All right. why don't you guys
take a break from hide and seek?

1041
