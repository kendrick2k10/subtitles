<i>This is me.</i>

4
00:01:06.397 --> 00:01:09.701
- Oh. yeah!
- <i>No. not this guy.</i>

5
00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:12.337
Oh. yeah. Oh. don't stop!

6
00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:15.441
- Oh. my God!
- <i>This guy.</i>

7
00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:16.776
Oh. my God!

8
00:01:16.808 --> 00:01:18.343
Oh. right there!

9
00:01:20.778 --> 00:01:22.081
Oh. yeah!

10
00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.784
I... I'm gonna...

11
00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:26.785
<i>I kind of wanted
to freeze to death that day.</i>

12
00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.621
Tim Long. no!

13
00:01:28.653 --> 00:01:31.323
<i>I even fantasized
about a headline.</i>

14
00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:33.659
<i>"Teenage Genius Dies
In Blizzard".</i>

15
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:35.193
<i>But in truth. I knew my death</i>

16
00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:39.465
<i>would make one paragraph
on page 12 at best.</i>

17
00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:42.335
<i>I grew up in what is technically
known among geographers</i>

18
00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:44.336
<i>as the middle
of fucking nowhere.</i>

19
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.873
<i>in a town whose mascot
was this guy.</i>

20
00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.708
<i>The white squirrel.</i>

21
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.644
<i>Now. white squirrels have a recessive
gene that makes them super rare...</i>

22
00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:54.680
<i>And super dumb.</i>

23
00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:57.250
<i>And in 1986.</i>

24
00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:00.620
<i>when the town was in the midst
of a crippling recession.</i>

25
00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:02.789
<i>Hobart and the squirrel
had a lot in common.</i>

26
00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:10.362
<i>They were both throwbacks
on the verge of extinction.</i>

27
00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:12.899
<i>struggling to fight off
stronger competitors.</i>

28
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:14.800
<i>and almost totally white.</i>

29
00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:24.410
Tim. come on!

30
00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:27.680
Yeah. it's tough
for everybody right now.

31
00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:29.816
Did you hear about
Robertson's variety?

32
00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.552
You know Doug Robertson.
no head for business.

33
00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:35.555
Tim. Mom's waiting!

34
00:02:35.587 --> 00:02:36.965
That's what you said
about Stedman Shoes

35
00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.425
and they've been in business
for 60 years. right?

36
00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:42.561
Hey. buddy!

37
00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:44.164
Hey.

38
00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:47.266
Yeah.

39
00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.411
You know. you don't got to go to
the parade meeting with your mom.

40
00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:52.471
You can always head down
to the rink and. uh.

41
00:02:52.503 --> 00:02:55.307
I don't know. hang out
with your friends.

42
00:03:04.582 --> 00:03:06.451
Why'd you have
to mention friends?

43
00:03:15.593 --> 00:03:18.597
I spy with my little eye
something that starts with a C.

44
00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:20.500
Car?

45
00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.634
Yeah.

46
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.240
<i>Hobart's annual
white squirrel parade</i>

47
00:03:27.272 --> 00:03:28.508
<i>was the most embarrassing</i>

48
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.843
<i>and culturally cringeworthy
event imaginable...</i>

49
00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:33.445
<i>Unless you are four years old.</i>

50
00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.482
<i>or Kevin. the parade organizer.</i>

51
00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:40.018
Come with me. if you will.

52
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:41.586
on a...

53
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.855
On a journey

54
00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:45.591
- through the mists of time.
- Whoa.

55
00:03:45.623 --> 00:03:48.728
Let the years roll back
before your eyes.

56
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.296
The '70s turn into the '60s.

57
00:03:52.764 --> 00:03:53.898
Groovy.

58
00:03:53.931 --> 00:03:55.367
Right on.

59
00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.237
The '50s. Elvis...

60
00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:00.772
The '40s. Korea...

61
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.509
Back and back and back we go...

62
00:04:05.843 --> 00:04:07.746
It's 1939.

63
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.484
The Nazis are cutting
a swath through Europe.

64
00:04:11.516 --> 00:04:14.419
Jews and gypsies are
murdered indiscriminately.

65
00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:16.021
Ooh.

66
00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:18.495
And the Toronto Maple Leafs have
won their second Stanley Cup.

67
00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.026
Yeah!

68
00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:21.394
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

69
00:04:22.394 --> 00:04:24.930
I propose this year.

70
00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:28.801
we recreate Hobart's very first

71
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.937
white squirrel parade.

72
00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:34.939
I'm sorry. why are there Nazis?

73
00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:36.942
There won't be actual Nazis.

74
00:04:36.975 --> 00:04:38.811
it was just
for historical context.

75
00:04:38.843 --> 00:04:41.314
Um. before we commit
to any one theme.

76
00:04:41.346 --> 00:04:43.915
we should maybe look at cost.

77
00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.651
Cut back a little.

78
00:04:45.684 --> 00:04:46.919
Hell. no.

79
00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:51.991
You know who cuts corners
on their town fairs?

80
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.593
Wingham.

81
00:04:55.627 --> 00:04:57.562
I think that Sheila has a point.

82
00:04:57.596 --> 00:04:59.598
I mean.
money is so tight these days.

83
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.001
Maybe we can cut back
on the snow removal.

84
00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:05.071
or the daycare hours
at the old folks home.

85
00:05:05.103 --> 00:05:07.673
But what about the theme?
Retro vintage!

86
00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:10.710
Okay. I think that the parade is
really important to a lot of people.

87
00:05:10.742 --> 00:05:12.844
So. why don't we just all
put our thinking caps on

88
00:05:12.877 --> 00:05:14.713
and. uh.
we'll discuss it next week.

89
00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:17.449
I tell you what.
why don't we put our thinking caps on.

90
00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:18.817
just discuss it next week.

91
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.353
I know the parade is really
important to everyone.

92
00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:22.987
- That's a great idea. Gary.
- Thank you.

93
00:05:25.057 --> 00:05:26.959
<i>While my schoolmates
were at the rink.</i>

94
00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:29.995
<i>I sought solace in the company
of our Town Hall janitor.</i>

95
00:05:30.028 --> 00:05:31.364
Hello.

96
00:05:31.396 --> 00:05:32.731
I. uh. couldn't decide between.

97
00:05:32.764 --> 00:05:35.634
<i>Yojimbo. Subway</i>
and <i>La Dolce Vita.</i>

98
00:05:36.601 --> 00:05:38.070
so I brought them all.

99
00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:41.574
What was that again?

100
00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:43.109
You told me you'd bought
a VCR player.

101
00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:45.877
so I thought I'd bring
some movies.

102
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:47.713
I don't care much for movies.

103
00:05:47.745 --> 00:05:48.880
Right. sure.

104
00:05:48.913 --> 00:05:50.783
But. in case you change
your mind.

105
00:05:50.815 --> 00:05:53.151
I'm gonna leave these here.

106
00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:55.120
Movies from all around
the world.

107
00:05:55.153 --> 00:05:56.788
including one from Korea.

108
00:05:56.822 --> 00:06:00.158
I shot my best friend in Korea.

109
00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:02.394
Used his body for shelter.

110
00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:06.732
Okay.

111
00:06:06.764 --> 00:06:09.668
I... I didn't know that. I'm sorry.
I'll take that one out.

112
00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:11.838
Farewell. <i>The Housemaid.</i>

113
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:15.675
There's a tampon blocking
the drain pipe.

114
00:06:16.908 --> 00:06:18.377
I'll see you later.

115
00:06:19.644 --> 00:06:21.079
Yeah. okay.

116
00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:24.182
Good luck with the. uh...

117
00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:26.119
Good luck with the...
With the tampon.

118
00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:31.423
You were really
impressive in there. Gary.

119
00:06:31.456 --> 00:06:33.024
You have such a way with words.

120
00:06:33.057 --> 00:06:35.528
Thank you for keeping
Tim company.

121
00:06:36.661 --> 00:06:38.062
Careful. it's the Crowfoots.

122
00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:39.564
What can I do for you. sir?

123
00:06:39.598 --> 00:06:40.633
Gun permit.

124
00:06:40.665 --> 00:06:42.535
- Downstairs to the left...
- Oops! Sorry!

125
00:06:43.935 --> 00:06:45.937
I heard the sister
doesn't even talk.

126
00:06:46.737 --> 00:06:47.906
Hi. Tim Long!

127
00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:49.975
Look. same sweater!

128
00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:53.512
See?

129
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.456
Hey. Long.

130
00:07:03.488 --> 00:07:04.589
How's your book?

131
00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:07.627
Uh. it's... It's not a book.

132
00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:09.028
it's a magazine.

133
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.097
Yeah? Are you gonna fuck it?

134
00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:15.835
How exactly would I do that?

135
00:07:15.867 --> 00:07:17.670
I don't know. man.
you're the one who's gay.

136
00:07:19.904 --> 00:07:21.873
Why is the magazine a man?

137
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.547
Dude. Fleming's coming.
We gotta go.

Um...

Wait. hold on.

153
00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:12.591
I just wanna talk to you about

154
00:08:12.624 --> 00:08:16.161
this France-Canada
exchange program.

155
00:08:16.194 --> 00:08:19.265
This is a really great way
to expand your horizons.

156
00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:21.165
A super-duper way
to make friends.

157
00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:24.136
learn about the world.
make sure your parents see this. too.

00:09:46.418 --> 00:09:47.686
It's good.

184
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.356
You didn't respond to the. uh.

Yeah. well.

00:20:34.665 --> 00:20:36.433
- Aww...
- Yeah.

353
00:20:36.467 --> 00:20:38.803
- Yeah. it's going great.
- I can see that.

354
00:20:38.836 --> 00:20:43.008
I brought you something.
It's called a bean bag chair.

355
00:20:45.042 --> 00:20:46.710
It's full of beans. like me.

356
00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:52.384
- She very funny.
- Yes. Yeah. very funny. Mom.

357
00:20:52.416 --> 00:20:53.417
I'll leave you to it.

358
00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:57.256
Tell you something. Tim.

359
00:20:58.623 --> 00:21:00.491
This is my best life.

360
00:21:01.392 --> 00:21:02.394
Lot of fun.

361
00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:04.529
Lot of fun.

362
00:21:06.396 --> 00:21:08.932
Well. uh. the couch folds out
into a bed.

363
00:21:08.965 --> 00:21:12.036
so you can feel free to get
on that. watch some movies.

364
00:21:12.069 --> 00:21:14.371
TV here is great. Records.

365
00:21:14.404 --> 00:21:15.840
- Hey. Tim. Tim.
- Music. Yeah.

366
00:21:16.941 --> 00:21:18.777
Soft like a woman. huh?

367
00:21:18.809 --> 00:21:20.845
- Oh. yeah.
- Like this?

368
00:21:20.877 --> 00:21:23.814
<i>Comme ca? Comme ca.</i>

369
00:21:23.847 --> 00:21:26.684
- Huh?
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. Do some of that.

370
00:21:26.718 --> 00:21:28.452
- Like this? Leg up?
- Oh.

371
00:21:28.486 --> 00:21:29.653
Yeah.

372
00:21:29.686 --> 00:21:31.423
That's great. yeah.

373
00:21:31.455 --> 00:21:32.923
Maybe like this. no hands?

374
00:21:32.957 --> 00:21:35.360
Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. okay.

375
00:21:35.393 --> 00:21:37.596
- Yes.
- Yeah. up and down.

376
00:21:38.796 --> 00:21:40.398
- Perfect.
- You try it now.

377
00:21:40.431 --> 00:21:42.600
- No.
- Soft like woman.

378
00:21:42.633 --> 00:21:44.936
Yeah. Or like a...
Lile a big old marshmallow.

379
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.908
Like a marshmallow.

380
00:21:55.613 --> 00:21:56.847
Good.

381
00:21:56.881 --> 00:21:59.017
Yeah. it's a lot of fun. Yeah.

382
00:22:01.551 --> 00:22:03.654
Stephane. school is at 8:30.

383
00:22:04.955 --> 00:22:08.425
I am already ready. Huh?

384
00:22:08.459 --> 00:22:11.663
Already ready. Already ready.
This is fun to say. eh?

385
00:22:11.695 --> 00:22:13.698
Bring the milk.
Toast on the table.

386
00:22:16.166 --> 00:22:19.503
Am I crazy. or are his pants
totally diaphanous?

387
00:22:19.537 --> 00:22:21.840
- Dia-what?
- They're see-through. His pants are...

388
00:22:23.074 --> 00:22:24.676
- Dad.
- Hello.

389
00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:29.413
Morning. boys.
Who wants French toast?

390
00:22:29.446 --> 00:22:31.982
Or I guess you would just call it toast.

391
00:22:33.718 --> 00:22:35.420
Mmm. Hmm.

392
00:22:35.452 --> 00:22:37.556
Glenn. I would like to tell you.

393
00:22:38.588 --> 00:22:39.957
you are so smart

394
00:22:40.825 --> 00:22:43.761
and so success. huh.

395
00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:46.898
You are. and Sheila. wow.
you are so beautiful.

396
00:22:46.931 --> 00:22:48.066
- Huh.
- Oh!

397
00:22:48.098 --> 00:22:50.368
- Yeah.
- Corn Flakes. please.

398
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.775
Hmm...

399
00:22:59.544 --> 00:23:02.080
Maybe you should
change your pants.

400
00:23:02.113 --> 00:23:04.950
because you can see right
through them.

401
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.986
- Can you really?
- Not at all.

402
00:23:09.019 --> 00:23:11.455
- Whole outfit's terrific.
- Yeah. it's great.

403
00:23:11.489 --> 00:23:13.424
- It's very chic.
- Very smart.

404
00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:15.826
<i>I talked Stephane
into changing his trousers.</i>

405
00:23:15.859 --> 00:23:18.128
<i>but I couldn't change him.</i>

406
00:23:18.162 --> 00:23:20.766
<i>I dreaded walking to school
with him that first day.</i>

407
00:23:22.633 --> 00:23:24.836
This place is like. uh...
What is that movie?

408
00:23:24.868 --> 00:23:26.570
Uh. <i>The Breakfast Club.</i>

409
00:23:27.904 --> 00:23:29.840
Trust me.
inside it's a nightmare.

410
00:23:29.874 --> 00:23:30.975
What? What nightmare?

411
00:23:31.008 --> 00:23:34.045
Hello. teachers.
Hello. fellow pupils.

412
00:23:34.077 --> 00:23:36.847
Hello. girl with
the pink hat on.

413
00:23:36.881 --> 00:23:40.051
- I love this school. I go this school now.
- Yeah.

414
00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:42.687
Please stop speaking.

415
00:23:44.521 --> 00:23:47.858
Boys. I don't know
what a cooch-gobbler even is...

416
00:23:47.892 --> 00:23:50.061
but I'm pretty sure that.

417
00:23:50.094 --> 00:23:53.030
Mrs. McConnell doesn't want it
scrawled all over her Subaru.

418
00:23:54.231 --> 00:23:55.599
Stephane. Mrs. Fleming.

419
00:23:55.633 --> 00:23:58.836
- <i>Allo.</i>
- Oh. oh.

420
00:23:58.869 --> 00:24:01.572
- Uh. that's the vice principal.
- Ah.

421
00:24:01.605 --> 00:24:03.540
And she also teaches French.

422
00:24:03.574 --> 00:24:05.977
And she. um.
is more or less mayor.

423
00:24:06.009 --> 00:24:08.212
Whoa! She very important. ah?

424
00:24:08.246 --> 00:24:10.915
No. Not really.
It's just Hobart. so...

425
00:24:10.948 --> 00:24:12.717
Uh. here. That's his paperwork.

426
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.652
I'll get out of your hair.
See you.

427
00:24:14.684 --> 00:24:17.221
Boys. I'll see you at lunch.

428
00:24:17.255 --> 00:24:19.791
Bye. cool guys.
I go this school now.

429
00:24:21.858 --> 00:24:23.861
We're glad you're here.
Stephane.

430
00:24:23.894 --> 00:24:25.262
Um...

431
00:24:25.296 --> 00:24:27.198
I know you had
a bit of a rough time at home.

432
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:30.734
but you can start with a clean
slate here at Hobart High.

433
00:24:30.768 --> 00:24:33.238
It's good. huh.
Hobart are number one.

434
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:36.007
Oh. go. the fighting white squirrel.

435
00:24:39.676 --> 00:24:40.878
<i>Salut.</i>

436
00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:42.614
You are a teacher here?

437
00:24:42.646 --> 00:24:45.649
Oh. No. Well. not yet.

438
00:24:48.452 --> 00:24:51.722
Well. I've applied to teacher's college.
and I'm still waiting to hear back.

439
00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:53.225
It's kind of a long story.

440
00:24:57.094 --> 00:24:58.096
Okay.

441
00:24:59.029 --> 00:25:00.065
<i>Allo.</i>

442
00:25:00.897 --> 00:25:02.165
Begin.

443
00:25:02.199 --> 00:25:04.302
Oh. um...

444
00:25:04.335 --> 00:25:06.938
Well. uh...

445
00:25:06.971 --> 00:25:12.609
I had the best teacher in kindergarten.
Mrs. Johannson. and she was just so kind

446
00:25:12.643 --> 00:25:14.979
and really like a second mom
to me in a lot of ways.

447
00:25:15.011 --> 00:25:16.513
That's 'cause her
real mom left town.

448
00:25:16.547 --> 00:25:20.617
and things got tough. and her dad
started hitting the sauce pretty hard.

449
00:25:20.651 --> 00:25:22.896
and she was forced to move in
with her auntie across town.

450
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.124
which basically made her
mega-into teachers. which.

451
00:25:26.156 --> 00:25:28.659
of course. is good for me.

452
00:25:28.692 --> 00:25:31.261
Sorry. honey.
just saving us a lot of time.

453
00:25:31.295 --> 00:25:36.634
Gary. um. this is Stephane.
he is the exchange student from France.

454
00:25:36.666 --> 00:25:39.069
Sure. why wouldn't he be?
Gary Rothbauer.

455
00:25:39.103 --> 00:25:40.337
Gary's a gym teacher.

456
00:25:40.371 --> 00:25:41.306
Hmm.

457
00:25:41.338 --> 00:25:44.308
- Gary's also the local law enforcement.
- Mmm.

458
00:25:44.342 --> 00:25:45.243
Part-time.

459
00:25:45.277 --> 00:25:47.345
Um. the real sheriff's
based in Wingham.

460
00:25:47.377 --> 00:25:48.378
Wingham's 20 miles away.

461
00:25:48.413 --> 00:25:51.782
so shit hits the fan.
I'm the first responder.

462
00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:54.218
I also teach skating.
hockey. and soccer.

463
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.054
You play soccer here?

464
00:25:56.086 --> 00:25:57.288
Does the Pope wear a dress?

465
00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.790
He does.

466
00:25:59.824 --> 00:26:01.625
Yes. he does.

467
00:26:02.292 --> 00:26:03.327
Really?

468
00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:04.896
Huh?

469
00:26:04.929 --> 00:26:07.699
See? International.
My jokes are international.

470
00:26:07.731 --> 00:26:10.367
May not look like it.
but he's one of us. Huh?

471
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:13.738
I like this guy. All right.
Listen. word to the wise.

472
00:26:15.772 --> 00:26:17.708
- Oh.
- Oh.

473
00:26:17.741 --> 00:26:19.610
Uh. just leave it.

474
00:26:19.644 --> 00:26:21.278
You may hear
people talking about

475
00:26:21.311 --> 00:26:24.247
me being the greatest hockey player
to ever come out of this town.

476
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.849
Played in pro-hockey. son.

477
00:26:25.883 --> 00:26:28.853
Power forward. 15 games.

478
00:26:28.885 --> 00:26:32.990
But the coach was an arsehole.
and who needs all the travel?

479
00:26:35.425 --> 00:26:36.627
I love soccer.

480
00:26:37.361 --> 00:26:40.865
I scored 20 goals in 20 games.

481
00:26:40.897 --> 00:26:42.132
- Wow.
- Not bad.

482
00:26:42.165 --> 00:26:44.269
Not bad at all.

483
00:26:45.368 --> 00:26:48.105
If you wanna play.
practice is at 2:00.

484
00:26:48.138 --> 00:26:49.773
- You can try for the team.
- <i>Oui?</i>

485
00:26:49.807 --> 00:26:52.043
Now. I'm firm. but I'm fair.

486
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:56.314
and. uh. I don't see color.

487
00:26:57.815 --> 00:26:59.750
Oh. no.

488
00:26:59.784 --> 00:27:02.020
You should.
uh. go see the doctor.

489
00:27:02.053 --> 00:27:03.154
- Why?
- Stephane.

490
00:27:05.088 --> 00:27:07.791
- Bye-bye. See you.
- Bye.

491
00:27:07.825 --> 00:27:09.227
Goodbye. queen of the office.

492
00:27:12.797 --> 00:27:13.797
Sweet kid.

493
00:27:15.865 --> 00:27:18.670
- Copier's out of paper.
- Sure. I'll get on that.

494
00:27:20.037 --> 00:27:23.040
<i>I had absolutely no idea
what to expect</i>

495
00:27:23.074 --> 00:27:24.942
<i>from Stephane's first day
at Hobart High.</i>

496
00:27:25.742 --> 00:27:26.910
<i>How he'd make out.</i>

497
00:27:26.943 --> 00:27:29.312
<i>Who would he antagonize?
What would he hump?</i>

498
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.990
<i>But what
I didn't expect was this.</i>

499
00:27:47.498 --> 00:27:50.168
<i>He joined more
sports teams than me. one...</i>

500
00:27:55.372 --> 00:27:57.307
<i>And made more friends than me.</i>

501
00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.344
<i>So. it was infuriating.</i>

502
00:28:09.519 --> 00:28:12.889
And I had the idea for
<i>Star Wars</i> way before it came out.

503
00:28:12.923 --> 00:28:14.163
There was no point in pursuing.

504
00:28:14.191 --> 00:28:15.994
Lose all the money
to lawyers and...

505
00:28:19.262 --> 00:28:21.231
And the lion spots his prey

506
00:28:22.266 --> 00:28:23.401
and moves in for the kill.

507
00:28:24.268 --> 00:28:26.237
Come on. Gary. I'm tired.

508
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:27.971
Maybe we can go...

509
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.842
Woof yourself.

510
00:28:32.209 --> 00:28:34.211
- Dick.
- I'll just wait here.

511
00:28:36.012 --> 00:28:37.014
Oh. jeez.

512
00:28:38.182 --> 00:28:40.084
Is that nubuck. hmm?

513
00:28:40.116 --> 00:28:41.752
- No.
- Sure it is.

514
00:28:43.086 --> 00:28:44.454
You gotta work with me here.

515
00:28:44.488 --> 00:28:45.623
Gary. I'm dying here.

516
00:28:45.655 --> 00:28:48.492
You're dying? What is this.
a shoe store or Live Aid?

517
00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:49.961
I have a family to feed.

518
00:28:49.993 --> 00:28:51.795
They're only $20.

519
00:28:51.828 --> 00:28:52.830
Look at that.

520
00:28:55.132 --> 00:28:56.868
That's not good.

521
00:28:56.901 --> 00:29:00.772
I'll give you 16 because I like
you. I'm doing you a favor.

522
00:29:05.576 --> 00:29:07.478
Make it 12. I'll give you 12.

523
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.380
And. uh.
you got any other colors?

524
00:29:10.413 --> 00:29:12.750
I'm not taking the floor model.

525
00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:16.120
I'll check.

526
00:29:16.153 --> 00:29:17.355
Thank you. Robbie.

527
00:29:17.387 --> 00:29:19.456
You drive a hard bargain.

528
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:22.026
Your dad'll be proud.

529
00:29:22.058 --> 00:29:23.394
How's your day?

530
00:29:23.426 --> 00:29:25.896
Pfft! Ooh la la.
it's not so easy.

531
00:29:27.163 --> 00:29:29.999
Oh. Really?

532
00:29:30.034 --> 00:29:32.903
- Why?
- Well. everyone wants to talk to me.

533
00:29:32.936 --> 00:29:37.574
"Stephane. Come sit with me."
"Stephane. you're so cool."

534
00:29:37.607 --> 00:29:39.476
Come to my house.
watch T.J. Hooker.

535
00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:42.346
My head is pfft!
It's crazy. huh.

536
00:29:42.378 --> 00:29:44.881
- You know this problem?
- Sure.

537
00:29:44.914 --> 00:29:47.018
Real dilemma.

538
00:29:48.117 --> 00:29:49.153
Is that Diane?

539
00:29:49.185 --> 00:29:51.555
<i>Bonjour.</i> Diane.

540
00:29:51.588 --> 00:29:54.258
Oh. uh... I don't speak...
Sorry.

541
00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:55.425
- Um...
- Huh?

542
00:29:58.229 --> 00:30:00.498
Oh. my God. Oh. my God.

543
00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:01.566
No. no. no.

544
00:30:08.038 --> 00:30:08.972
Oh. my God. Oh. my God.

545
00:30:09.006 --> 00:30:12.043
Mr. Steadman. are you alive?
He's dead.

546
00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:13.552
- Are you alive. He's alive. Okay.
- Is he dead?

547
00:30:13.576 --> 00:30:14.377
Can you say something. please?

548
00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:16.180
Oh. my gosh. Mr. Steadman.

549
00:30:16.212 --> 00:30:17.347
I'm fine.

550
00:30:17.381 --> 00:30:19.217
- Thank you so much.
- Here. let me help you.

551
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:23.119
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me.

552
00:30:23.153 --> 00:30:24.255
What's going on?

553
00:30:24.288 --> 00:30:26.057
Stephane here
just saved my life.

554
00:30:26.089 --> 00:30:28.326
Oh. no. it's. uh. nothing.

555
00:30:28.358 --> 00:30:30.327
No. you did. Thank you.

556
00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:32.530
Nine and a half.

557
00:30:35.098 --> 00:30:39.002
<i>That night my parents wanted
to reward Stephane for his heroism</i>

558
00:30:39.036 --> 00:30:41.138
<i>by showing him
the best of Canadian cuisine.</i>

559
00:30:41.171 --> 00:30:43.374
- It's so good.
- <i>So. we went for a Chinese meal.</i>

560
00:30:43.406 --> 00:30:46.977
In France. this meal
costs one millions dollar.

561
00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:49.212
- Canada. too.
- Oh.

562
00:30:49.246 --> 00:30:52.016
Hey. there he is.

563
00:30:52.316 --> 00:30:53.351
Herb DeVries.

564
00:30:53.384 --> 00:30:54.551
Stephane Belmadi.

565
00:30:54.585 --> 00:30:56.086
Is that right?

566
00:30:56.119 --> 00:30:57.221
How do you pronounce that?

567
00:30:57.253 --> 00:30:59.122
Stephane Bermady.

568
00:31:01.191 --> 00:31:02.593
No.

569
00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:08.365
So. uh. I heard you saved poor
little Diane Dearling's life today.

570
00:31:08.398 --> 00:31:09.633
Oh. no. no. no. It's nothing.

571
00:31:09.666 --> 00:31:12.102
<i>Bonjour.</i> hero of the hour.

572
00:31:12.135 --> 00:31:15.205
<i>Bonjour. Enchante...</i>

573
00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:21.379
Sheila.
can I bend your ear for a sec?

574
00:31:21.412 --> 00:31:24.981
Hello. anybody notice
we're eating here?

575
00:31:25.015 --> 00:31:29.387
You know. I've made a lot of progress
with our retro-vintage theme.

576
00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.422
Kev. you know.
I love it when you think big.

577
00:31:31.454 --> 00:31:34.893
I just think that. you know. we need a
theme that's a little closer to home.

578
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.529
- Okay.
- Sorry. Not to hurt your feelings.

579
00:31:39.563 --> 00:31:41.566
- No. I can respect that.
- I'm sorry.

580
00:31:50.273 --> 00:31:53.243
Lightbulb alert. Stephane.

581
00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:58.682
Our theme is Stephane.

582
00:31:58.715 --> 00:32:01.985
Wait. You want the theme of the
parade to be Stephane?

583
00:32:02.486 --> 00:32:04.689
He's been here three days.

584
00:32:04.721 --> 00:32:06.423
Lorna. come over
and hear Kev's new plan.

585
00:32:06.457 --> 00:32:11.162
Well. not Stephane.
but Stephane.

586
00:32:11.627 --> 00:32:12.628
- Mmm-hmm?
- Mmm.

587
00:32:12.663 --> 00:32:16.032
- Who he is. What he represents.
- Yeah.

588
00:32:16.066 --> 00:32:20.538
- Hobart welcomes the world.
- Yeah.

589
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:23.307
International friendship!

590
00:32:23.339 --> 00:32:24.574
Yeah. that could work.

591
00:32:24.607 --> 00:32:26.543
- Eggrolls for everyone.
- Whoo!

592
00:32:26.576 --> 00:32:28.045
- Oh!
- Yeah!

593
00:32:28.077 --> 00:32:30.513
- Thanks. Glenn.
- Thank you.

594
00:32:49.298 --> 00:32:53.037
You know
who should join you? Dr. Moe.

595
00:32:54.137 --> 00:32:56.206
- Dr. Moe. the town dentist.
- Mmm-hmm.

596
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.275
Moe!

597
00:32:59.209 --> 00:33:00.278
Moe!

598
00:33:01.278 --> 00:33:02.279
Moe. look!

599
00:33:03.247 --> 00:33:05.282
- Huh?
- Huh?

600
00:33:05.315 --> 00:33:07.418
Where are you from. again?

601
00:33:07.451 --> 00:33:11.322
- Ottawa.
- No. he means where you're from-from?

602
00:33:12.423 --> 00:33:15.625
I was born in Egypt. but moved
when I was an infant.

603
00:33:15.659 --> 00:33:17.495
That's great.

604
00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:22.333
Stephane. you can be France
and Dr. Moe can be... Africa.

605
00:33:22.365 --> 00:33:24.201
No fucking way.

606
00:33:25.068 --> 00:33:27.238
Can you go talk to him
because...

607
00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.716
I need both of you and he gets a
little moody and won't listen to me.

608
00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:32.043
Hey! I can still hear you.

609
00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:34.545
He can still hear us
so just nod.

610
00:33:34.577 --> 00:33:36.446
Jesus! This fucking town.

611
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.115
That was great. eh?

612
00:33:38.749 --> 00:33:40.351
Oh. careful. honey.

613
00:33:42.086 --> 00:33:45.389
Do you know the English word.
grapefruit. huh?

614
00:33:45.422 --> 00:33:49.326
In French we have a word.
we call it a <i>pamplemousse.</i>

615
00:33:52.195 --> 00:33:55.365
<i>Pamplemousse</i> is a funny word. huh?

616
00:33:55.398 --> 00:33:59.536
Tim. I know he isn't.
uh. what you expected.

617
00:33:59.569 --> 00:34:01.838
Yeah. Understatement.

618
00:34:01.872 --> 00:34:04.375
Give it time. You know.
relationships can be tricky.

619
00:34:04.407 --> 00:34:05.509
I understand that.

620
00:34:05.542 --> 00:34:08.679
It's like a garden.
with attention and cultivation.

621
00:34:08.711 --> 00:34:09.813
good things can grow.

622
00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:12.216
We only got six egg rolls.

623
00:34:12.248 --> 00:34:14.818
- but you're charging us for eight.
- But if you look...

624
00:34:14.851 --> 00:34:15.652
Glenn.

625
00:34:15.686 --> 00:34:17.688
You see. you have extra.

626
00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:26.730
So. this is. uh.
your favorite movie?

627
00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:29.800
Oh. one of them. Yeah.

628
00:34:31.367 --> 00:34:33.471
Yeah. Plus. it's French.

629
00:34:33.503 --> 00:34:34.806
- So. you know...
- I see that.

630
00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:43.281
- We don't have to watch it.
- No. it's. uh... It's fine.

631
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.851
Maybe. uh.
we just sit and talk. huh?

632
00:34:47.885 --> 00:34:49.754
One to other. asking questions.

633
00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:53.691
- Yeah. Okay. Sure.
- Mmm.

634
00:34:54.858 --> 00:34:58.229
Um. okay. well...

635
00:34:58.862 --> 00:35:01.331
Tell me about Paris.
What's it like?

636
00:35:01.364 --> 00:35:04.234
Old. How many times
you make the fuck. Tim?

637
00:35:06.302 --> 00:35:09.306
- What?
- Two times? Three times?

638
00:35:09.338 --> 00:35:12.476
Five times? Twenty-five times.
you dirty boy. huh?

639
00:35:12.509 --> 00:35:13.878
- Busy boy.
- Please!

640
00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:16.480
Can you tell me
anything about Paris?

641
00:35:16.512 --> 00:35:19.616
Just tell me about the Louvre.
the Champs-Elysees. anything.

642
00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:22.186
That is tourist Paris.

643
00:35:23.653 --> 00:35:25.222
It's. uh. not my Paris.

644
00:35:29.458 --> 00:35:30.827
My Paris is not so great.

645
00:35:34.331 --> 00:35:35.432
Oh.

646
00:35:36.333 --> 00:35:38.869
So. uh. tomorrow we meet
your friends. huh?

647
00:35:39.869 --> 00:35:42.873
Yeah. Yeah. maybe.
I don't know. we'll see.

648
00:35:45.775 --> 00:35:47.777
Maybe we'll watch
a different movie.

649
00:35:48.478 --> 00:35:49.880
- Sure. Okay.
- <i>Oui.</i>

650
00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:52.250
Let's do that. Yeah. Okay.

651
00:35:52.949 --> 00:35:54.417
Oh.

652
00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:58.222
If it's French. I warn you.
I've probably already seen it.

653
00:35:58.255 --> 00:35:59.257
It is French.

654
00:36:02.992 --> 00:36:05.462
Oh.

655
00:36:08.398 --> 00:36:09.900
Uh...

656
00:36:09.932 --> 00:36:11.568
You travel with your own porn?

657
00:36:13.603 --> 00:36:15.906
Yes. and. uh. toothpaste.

658
00:36:18.608 --> 00:36:19.876
It's good. huh?

659
00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:27.518
- I think I'm gonna go to bed.
- Why?

660
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.420
Why? You don't like this movie?

661
00:36:29.452 --> 00:36:31.422
No. I just. uh...

662
00:36:31.454 --> 00:36:33.391
I don't think that would
happen in a courthouse.

663
00:36:37.893 --> 00:36:39.929
That was a fun night. huh?

664
00:36:39.963 --> 00:36:42.298
Gosh. I thought
that was such a great idea

665
00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:45.868
about involving Stephane
in the parade.

666
00:36:45.902 --> 00:36:47.972
Mmm-hmm.

667
00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:55.378
- Glenn.
- Yeah.

668
00:36:56.512 --> 00:36:57.514
- Glenn?
- Yeah.

669
00:36:58.282 --> 00:36:59.917
Kev's idea.

670
00:36:59.949 --> 00:37:02.452
"Hobart welcomes the world."
It's not bad. huh?

671
00:37:02.485 --> 00:37:04.254
Yeah. yeah. Sure.

672
00:37:05.355 --> 00:37:06.423
- Glenn...
- Yeah.

673
00:37:06.456 --> 00:37:07.992
It'll cost. though.

674
00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:11.327
You know. we might need some
more money from the community.

675
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.931
I'm not... I don't know how
to ask people right now.

676
00:37:13.963 --> 00:37:17.268
I just think the times are...
What? What?

677
00:37:18.001 --> 00:37:20.304
- Is there moisturizer on my lips?
- No. No.

678
00:37:20.336 --> 00:37:24.474
Your eyes look...
Really pretty right now.

679
00:37:24.507 --> 00:37:27.244
Oh. That's nice.

680
00:37:27.777 --> 00:37:28.945
No. no. Keep them on.

681
00:37:28.978 --> 00:37:30.980
That's it. Oh. even prettier.

682
00:37:31.014 --> 00:37:33.884
Thanks. Anyway...

683
00:37:33.916 --> 00:37:36.987
Long Tractor really is one of
the very few thriving bits.

684
00:37:37.019 --> 00:37:38.655
Yeah! Oh...

685
00:37:43.025 --> 00:37:44.461
Sorry about my...

686
00:37:47.731 --> 00:37:49.633
- Jeez. Glenn! Gosh!
- Sheila. come on.

687
00:37:49.666 --> 00:37:52.068
- No. Glenn.
- It's game 7.

688
00:37:52.101 --> 00:37:54.504
It's... Sheila!

689
00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:00.377
Hey. how's it going?

690
00:38:00.409 --> 00:38:02.045
Fuck off.

691
00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:09.420
Tim Long!

692
00:38:09.452 --> 00:38:10.521
Tim!

693
00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:11.655
Tim Long.

694
00:38:11.688 --> 00:38:14.959
Tim. Tim. Tim.

695
00:38:21.097 --> 00:38:23.300
Your friend
seems to be catching on.

696
00:38:24.034 --> 00:38:25.536
He's not my friend.

697
00:38:25.568 --> 00:38:27.737
He's more of a cruel joke
I played on myself.

698
00:38:27.771 --> 00:38:29.707
Well. he's no Dale Hawerchuk.

699
00:38:29.739 --> 00:38:30.640
Sure.

700
00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:31.950
That's my brother's
favorite hockey player.

701
00:38:31.974 --> 00:38:33.743
Not mine. though.

702
00:38:33.777 --> 00:38:35.378
Okay. You got it.

703
00:38:35.411 --> 00:38:37.080
If you asked me
my favorite hockey player.

704
00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:39.583
I definitely wouldn't say
Dale Hawerchuk.

705
00:38:43.119 --> 00:38:45.655
So. who's your favorite
hockey player. Brenda?

706
00:38:45.688 --> 00:38:47.690
Oh...

707
00:38:47.724 --> 00:38:49.593
I guess I don't really have one.

708
00:38:54.764 --> 00:38:56.500
This rink is cold.

709
00:38:59.168 --> 00:39:02.538
- I'm sorry I make you fall.
- I'm so sorry.

710
00:39:02.572 --> 00:39:05.075
<i>It felt like I was
the only person in Hobart</i>

711
00:39:05.108 --> 00:39:07.644
<i>who hadn't fallen in love
with Stephane.</i>

712
00:39:07.677 --> 00:39:08.711
It's <i>pamplemousse.</i>

713
00:39:09.846 --> 00:39:11.414
It's a fun word to say.

714
00:39:11.447 --> 00:39:12.750
<i>Made every female swoon.</i>

715
00:39:14.184 --> 00:39:16.086
<i>He inspired a freaking parade.</i>

716
00:39:16.552 --> 00:39:18.422
Aw...

717
00:39:18.454 --> 00:39:20.590
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

718
00:39:20.623 --> 00:39:23.626
I'm not wearing this. Uh-uh.

719
00:39:23.659 --> 00:39:26.763
<i>And he was the star of the
best team Hobart had seen in years.</i>

720
00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:29.967
<i>With a real shot at beating
our arch rival. Wingham.</i>

721
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.501
No showboating.

722
00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:38.942
Ooh la la.
Stephane! Ooh la la. Stephane!

723
00:39:38.974 --> 00:39:41.045
Hobart Squirrels are number one!

724
00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:46.683
Get him the
ball and watch him go!

725
00:39:48.117 --> 00:39:49.920
Seven. huh? I love Hobart.

726
00:39:49.952 --> 00:39:53.456
<i>But one thing Stephane couldn't
do was save my dad's failing business.</i>

727
00:39:53.489 --> 00:39:56.159
Sales are down this month.
We got to work on our technique.

728
00:39:56.193 --> 00:39:58.996
All right. Todd. let's try one out.
You be the customer.

729
00:40:00.463 --> 00:40:05.001
Hello. sir.
I'm interested in the 1160...

730
00:40:05.034 --> 00:40:09.038
Combine. but I'm not yet ready
to pull the trigger.

731
00:40:09.072 --> 00:40:13.076
Mmm-hmm. Okay. Geoff. you see how
he uses his hands when he's talking?

732
00:40:13.108 --> 00:40:15.011
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- No. No.

733
00:40:15.045 --> 00:40:15.980
It's not wrong or right.

734
00:40:16.012 --> 00:40:19.182
It is just. uh.
a trait for me to mirror.

735
00:40:19.215 --> 00:40:21.818
when we're talking.
That way you'll trust me.

736
00:40:21.851 --> 00:40:23.987
And we'll establish rapport.

737
00:40:24.019 --> 00:40:26.623
Oh. here comes Ivan.

738
00:40:26.655 --> 00:40:29.625
Good news is he bringing today?
Jesus. fuck.

739
00:40:29.659 --> 00:40:31.762
Watch and learn. boys.
Watch and learn.

740
00:40:32.929 --> 00:40:33.963
Ivan.

741
00:40:33.996 --> 00:40:35.565
What can I do you for?

742
00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:38.535
Need to bring it back. Glenn.
Things are really bad.

743
00:40:38.568 --> 00:40:39.937
Uh-huh.

744
00:40:39.969 --> 00:40:43.673
Okay. I hear you.
I hear you. buddy.

745
00:40:43.706 --> 00:40:46.076
I think if you take a look at
our re-financing plans.

746
00:40:46.108 --> 00:40:50.713
you really don't want to make the
decision until such time as. uh...

747
00:41:00.123 --> 00:41:01.559
I'll start the paperwork.

748
00:41:02.791 --> 00:41:04.760
How's the wife?

749
00:41:04.793 --> 00:41:07.730
Not good. Glenn. Not good.

750
00:41:07.764 --> 00:41:10.534
Excellent. <i>Excellente.</i>

751
00:41:10.567 --> 00:41:12.068
That was amazing. Tim Long.

752
00:41:12.101 --> 00:41:17.974
You took that acetic acid. You sized it
up and then titrated the shit out of it.

753
00:41:18.007 --> 00:41:19.576
Uh. Tim. Tim. Tim.

754
00:41:21.878 --> 00:41:24.715
Drive us to Mary's house. huh?
She wants to make out.

755
00:41:25.949 --> 00:41:27.851
Uh. no can do. Sorry.

756
00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:32.523
Uh. because I promised
I'd give Brenda a ride home.

757
00:41:33.822 --> 00:41:35.025
I live right next to Brenda.

758
00:41:35.057 --> 00:41:37.827
Amazing. We all go together.

759
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.663
- <i>Formidable.</i> Let's go.
<i>- Formidable.</i>

760
00:41:42.898 --> 00:41:44.134
Come on.

761
00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:48.838
It's getting pretty snowy.

762
00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.842
It's just flurries.

763
00:41:52.876 --> 00:41:54.912
<i>♪ Flurries...</i>

764
00:41:54.945 --> 00:41:56.881
<i>♪ You got me in a hurry</i>

765
00:41:57.847 --> 00:42:01.218
<i>♪ Just to shovel my driveway</i>

766
00:42:02.184 --> 00:42:05.556
<i>♪ Squalls. I like you
best of all ♪</i>

767
00:42:05.588 --> 00:42:07.190
Hey. do you mind if we're quiet?

768
00:42:07.222 --> 00:42:08.625
I'm an anxious driver.

769
00:42:08.657 --> 00:42:10.594
You got it.

770
00:42:12.896 --> 00:42:15.699
Tim. pull over. eh?

771
00:42:15.731 --> 00:42:18.201
Uh. no. No. it's fine.
We keep going.

772
00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:21.805
Jesus Christ!

773
00:42:26.775 --> 00:42:30.079
Tim. she likes you. huh.
Make with her.

774
00:42:30.112 --> 00:42:31.213
Uh...

775
00:42:31.246 --> 00:42:33.616
Did you learn to whisper
in a helicopter?

776
00:42:38.355 --> 00:42:40.324
Uh...

777
00:42:40.356 --> 00:42:42.625
- Do you want to...
- Yes.

778
00:42:43.193 --> 00:42:45.229
Uh. play a word game?

779
00:42:46.929 --> 00:42:48.331
Um...

780
00:42:48.364 --> 00:42:53.736
I'll say the name of a place and then
you can say another name of a place

781
00:42:53.769 --> 00:42:56.672
that begins with the last
letter of the place I said.

782
00:42:57.706 --> 00:43:00.710
- I'll start with Canada.
- Okay.

783
00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:04.347
Arkansas. Guys. do you
want to play? We're on "S."

784
00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.248
Sault Ste. Marie.

785
00:43:06.282 --> 00:43:08.085
That's a great one.

786
00:43:08.117 --> 00:43:10.152
My cousin plays junior
hockey there.

787
00:43:10.186 --> 00:43:11.888
They must be good.

788
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.289
They're amazing.

789
00:43:17.159 --> 00:43:21.797
- Tim. just do it. The time is now.
- No.

790
00:43:22.632 --> 00:43:25.302
- The time is now!
- Okay.

791
00:43:25.335 --> 00:43:26.936
I'll tell you what?
I'll just get out.

792
00:43:28.771 --> 00:43:30.007
No.

793
00:43:39.849 --> 00:43:44.355
Ah... Ah... Oh...

794
00:44:01.304 --> 00:44:03.307
Oh. it's snowing. it seems. huh?

795
00:44:05.875 --> 00:44:07.344
That was crazy. Tim Long.

796
00:44:09.045 --> 00:44:10.648
What letter are we on?

797
00:44:12.782 --> 00:44:14.284
<i>After that. it became clear</i>

798
00:44:14.317 --> 00:44:16.820
<i>the person I had hoped
would be my salvation.</i>

799
00:44:16.853 --> 00:44:23.025
<i>my brother-in-arms.</i> mon camarade.
<i>made me feel lonelier than ever.</i>

800
00:44:23.059 --> 00:44:27.364
<i>So. while Stephane cut a swath
through Hobart's female population.</i>

801
00:44:27.396 --> 00:44:29.865
<i>I had never felt
like more of an outsider.</i>

802
00:44:30.833 --> 00:44:33.069
<i>Hobart's very own</i> I'etranger.

803
00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:45.282
Hey. Stephane.

804
00:44:47.884 --> 00:44:48.918
Glenn.

805
00:44:50.519 --> 00:44:52.822
You must tell Sheila
your troubles. huh?

806
00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:55.392
What troubles?

807
00:45:00.063 --> 00:45:01.699
Oh. God. You're right.

808
00:45:02.398 --> 00:45:04.101
I just don't want to worry her.

809
00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:06.503
You worry her now.
Remember. Glenn.

810
00:45:06.536 --> 00:45:12.009
honest. lead to close.
And close. lead to sexy.

811
00:45:13.777 --> 00:45:15.846
You're a wise man. Stephane.

812
00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:19.116
Hash browns?

813
00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:23.987
Not so wise for Tim. I think.

814
00:45:25.054 --> 00:45:27.324
- He hate me.
- No. no. no.

815
00:45:27.356 --> 00:45:29.992
Oh. no. no. no. no. no. no. no.

816
00:45:31.561 --> 00:45:32.763
Maybe.

817
00:45:33.663 --> 00:45:35.073
Oh. yeah. no.
I'm pretty sure he does.

818
00:45:35.097 --> 00:45:40.436
The thing about Tim is. and I say
this both as a father and a salesman.

819
00:45:40.469 --> 00:45:44.040
You can't coax him to do things.
He's got to be forced.

820
00:45:45.108 --> 00:45:46.876
You got to drag him to yes.

821
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:49.379
You'll thank me later.

822
00:45:52.181 --> 00:45:54.950
Tim. Tim.

823
00:45:54.983 --> 00:45:58.387
- Wake up. We must go. <i>Allez.</i>
- What? What?

824
00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.423
Where are the keys to the car?

825
00:46:03.492 --> 00:46:05.795
Stephane. what's going on?

826
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.131
Did you get in trouble?

827
00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:10.432
Did you get a girl pregnant?
Did you get a bunch of girls pregnant?

828
00:46:10.465 --> 00:46:11.835
Do you have AIDS?

829
00:46:11.867 --> 00:46:13.479
Oh. I saw... Are you driving
with your knees?

830
00:46:13.503 --> 00:46:15.205
Tim. chill out.

831
00:46:15.237 --> 00:46:17.940
- "Chill out."
- You have to trust me. Tim.

832
00:46:17.974 --> 00:46:20.143
What? How the hell
did you get your license?

833
00:46:20.175 --> 00:46:22.578
- I don't have license.
- You don't have a license?

834
00:46:22.612 --> 00:46:24.815
I'm not stupid.
That's why we take the back roads.

835
00:46:24.847 --> 00:46:26.315
Okay. stop the car right now.

836
00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:28.360
Pull over. and you have to tell
me where we are going.

837
00:46:28.384 --> 00:46:31.153
Okay. okay.
we are going to McDonalds.

838
00:46:31.186 --> 00:46:34.123
- To McDonalds?
- Why? I know you love McDonalds.

839
00:46:34.157 --> 00:46:36.159
And it's only three hours away.
I look at the map.

840
00:46:36.192 --> 00:46:38.161
- Stop the car.
- Burgers for breakfast. Tim.

841
00:46:38.193 --> 00:46:40.833
- It is like dream come true for you.
- I don't care. stop the car.

842
00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:54.176
Okay. so that's not my fault.

843
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:56.813
You said stop. so I
stopped. so we stop.

844
00:46:58.347 --> 00:46:59.449
Oh. my... Get out.

845
00:46:59.481 --> 00:47:00.983
- What?
- Get out. Get out of the car.

846
00:47:01.016 --> 00:47:02.985
- Why?
- Because I'm driving us home.

847
00:47:03.018 --> 00:47:03.886
Okay. fine.

848
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.155
Don't yell at me. huh.

849
00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:09.259
Whoa. whoa.

850
00:47:13.295 --> 00:47:14.463
Shit.

851
00:47:14.496 --> 00:47:17.600
Tim. I feel like I have done
things to make you not like me.

852
00:47:17.634 --> 00:47:18.969
Oh. what do you think?

853
00:47:20.302 --> 00:47:23.172
If you tell me the things.
I will not do them again.

854
00:47:23.206 --> 00:47:26.142
Okay. you know. why don't we
start with the drinking.

855
00:47:26.175 --> 00:47:28.345
the smoking.
the sex in the backseat.

856
00:47:28.378 --> 00:47:31.114
the porn and all that constant...

857
00:47:36.385 --> 00:47:37.487
What was that?

858
00:47:37.519 --> 00:47:39.056
I think you hit something.

859
00:47:41.224 --> 00:47:44.961
- Shit. shit. shit.
- Oh...

860
00:47:44.994 --> 00:47:46.663
- Oh. my God.
- I think you kill him.

861
00:47:46.695 --> 00:47:48.264
- Her.
- It's a girl?

862
00:47:48.297 --> 00:47:49.465
Yeah. it's a cow.

863
00:47:49.498 --> 00:47:50.900
Of course it's a girl.

864
00:47:51.233 --> 00:47:51.902
Oh.

865
00:47:51.934 --> 00:47:54.503
You're angry. aren't you. huh?

866
00:47:54.536 --> 00:47:56.372
- Did not like to kill the cow?
- No.

867
00:47:56.405 --> 00:47:58.440

But since you've been here.
you've put so much shit

that was already there.

881
00:48:26.568 --> 00:48:28.672

the original shit was.

882

Hey. can you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

883
00:48:31.306 --> 00:48:32.942

You drink the water.
you not get sick.

1043
00:55:44.072 --> 00:55:45.107
- Okay.
- This way.

1044
00:55:45.141 --> 00:55:46.576
- This way. this way.
- Okay.

1045
00:55:46.608 --> 00:55:47.409
Oh. my...

1046
00:55:47.443 --> 00:55:50.413
<i>Voila!</i>

1047
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:56.353
Happy Birthday. Sheila.

1048
00:55:59.554 --> 00:56:00.956
- Tim. ooh la la.
- <i>Oui. oui.</i>

1049
00:56:00.989 --> 00:56:03.125
Thank you so much boys. <i>J'adore.</i>

1050
00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:11.501
Happy Birthday. Sheila.

1051
00:56:15.003 --> 00:56:16.806
Mmm.

1052
00:56:19.675 --> 00:56:20.677
Here you go.

1053
00:56:23.778 --> 00:56:24.780
Thank you.

1054
00:56:27.916 --> 00:56:29.418
Wow. okay.

1055
00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:30.620
Fifty-four dollars.

1056
00:56:31.753 --> 00:56:35.924
Maybe I'll go to the dollar
store and buy 54 things.

1057
00:56:44.199 --> 00:56:45.501
<i>And remember to support</i>

1058
00:56:45.534 --> 00:56:49.038
<i>the White Squirrel this afternoon.
It's a big game against Wingham.</i>

1059
00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:50.605
<i>Go. White Squirrels!</i>

1060
00:56:50.639 --> 00:56:52.608
Hey. hey. good luck
with the big game.

1061
00:56:52.641 --> 00:56:55.043
Huh? And good luck
with your. uh...

1062
00:56:55.077 --> 00:56:58.614
Yep. my. uh... My French presentation
in front of the entire class.

1063
00:56:58.646 --> 00:57:01.451
<i>Exactement.</i>
I predict you make a big wow.

1064
00:57:01.483 --> 00:57:03.886
Well. score
a sport point for me.

1065
00:57:09.057 --> 00:57:12.829
<i>While Stephane was getting ready
for the biggest game of the year.</i>

1066
00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:15.465
<i>not everybody was rooting
for him to be the hero.</i>

1067
00:57:15.498 --> 00:57:17.567
Dude can't take a fucking joke.

1068
00:57:26.041 --> 00:57:27.844
Let's go. White Squirrels!
Come on!

1069
00:57:30.612 --> 00:57:32.013
Let's go. White Squirrels.

1070
00:57:32.047 --> 00:57:34.150
Come on. Stephane.

1071
00:57:34.182 --> 00:57:35.751
What are you doing there?

1072
00:57:35.784 --> 00:57:36.818
Use the wing.

1073
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:38.187
Give it to the wing.

1074
00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:43.492
Come on.

1075
00:57:43.525 --> 00:57:44.960
Way to go. brown clown.

1076
00:57:44.994 --> 00:57:46.663
Yeah. brown clown. way to go.

1077
00:57:47.096 --> 00:57:48.465
All right.

1078
00:57:50.132 --> 00:57:51.200
Hey.

1079
00:57:51.233 --> 00:57:52.468
Hey. that's a foul.

1080
00:57:52.501 --> 00:57:55.605
- Move it. move it.
- Watch your feet. brown clown.

1081
00:58:08.317 --> 00:58:10.719
Uh. I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous.

1082
00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:11.821
It's okay. it's okay.

1083
00:58:11.853 --> 00:58:13.999
You know what. you can do your
presentation in English.

1084
00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:15.191
The film is in French.

1085
00:58:15.224 --> 00:58:16.926
Okay. Thank you.

1086
00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:18.860
Um...

1087
00:58:20.195 --> 00:58:22.298
Now you'll immediately see
the director uses

1088
00:58:22.331 --> 00:58:25.701
costuming and lighting
to convey mood.

1089
00:58:25.733 --> 00:58:29.237
And. um. we open on a
protagonist. who's a thief.

1090
00:58:29.271 --> 00:58:31.140
A con. a cheat.

1091
00:58:31.172 --> 00:58:32.274
A cock smoker.

1092
00:58:33.909 --> 00:58:34.911
And he's...

1093
00:58:36.045 --> 00:58:37.280
<i>I love the girl.</i>

1094
00:58:37.313 --> 00:58:39.115
<i>You know how much
I love the girl.</i>

1095
00:58:40.849 --> 00:58:41.849
Oh. shit.

1096
00:58:44.786 --> 00:58:46.822
Watch your feet.
brown fucking clown.

1097
00:58:48.289 --> 00:58:50.058
Oh!

1098
00:59:06.007 --> 00:59:08.109
<i>No. I like girls a lot.
I just don't...</i>

1099
00:59:08.143 --> 00:59:09.778
"I like girls." What a freak.

1100
00:59:11.347 --> 00:59:13.583
Tim wants to get on
Brenda Crowfoot!

1101
00:59:14.215 --> 00:59:15.284
Loser.

1102
00:59:15.317 --> 00:59:17.052
<i>I think that I would
probably say yes.</i>

1103
00:59:17.952 --> 00:59:18.954
Stop it.

1104
00:59:26.094 --> 00:59:27.829
This is the greatest thing ever.

1105
00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:33.169
Come on. Come on.

1106
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:37.172
Damn it!

1107
00:59:40.108 --> 00:59:43.011
Well. son. I'm not one
to point fingers.

1108
00:59:43.045 --> 00:59:44.981
never have been. not my nature.

1109
00:59:45.914 --> 00:59:49.586
But. uh. you just fucked
the entire town.

1110
00:59:50.251 --> 00:59:51.152
It's not my fault.

1111
00:59:51.186 --> 00:59:53.088
Not your fault?
Well. whose fault is it?

1112
00:59:53.121 --> 00:59:55.724
Uh. Colonel Gadhafi. hmm?

1113
00:59:56.358 --> 00:59:58.126
You're a disgrace. son.

1114
00:59:58.159 --> 00:59:59.694
You're disgrace
to the White Squirrel.

1115
00:59:59.728 --> 01:00:02.065
There. I said it!
Okay? I said it.

1116
01:00:02.931 --> 01:00:04.099
Fuck you

1117
01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.035
and fuck your White Squirrel.

1118
01:00:07.001 --> 01:00:09.137
And fuck this
piece of shit town!

1119
01:00:12.907 --> 01:00:15.810
- Shame on you!
- I'll be okay. Huh?

1120
01:00:15.844 --> 01:00:16.846
Enough!

1121
01:00:16.878 --> 01:00:18.246
Me? You saw what he did. This...

1122
01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.182
It's not how we do things
in Hobart.

1123
01:00:20.215 --> 01:00:22.318
Oh. yeah. No.
We just victimize teenage boys

1124
01:00:22.351 --> 01:00:25.421
because we're scared and jealous
that they're not like us.

1125
01:00:25.454 --> 01:00:26.822
Sure.

1126
01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:30.726
You know what? I don't think I can
be with a man that I don't respect.

1127
01:00:30.759 --> 01:00:32.228
We need to take a break.

1128
01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.297
I'll pick up my stuff
on the weekend.

1129
01:00:42.871 --> 01:00:44.307
What? Hmm?

1130
01:00:45.306 --> 01:00:46.308
Nothing.

1131
01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:48.978
You wanna give me 20?

1132
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:50.079
- No.
- Twenty laps?

1133
01:00:50.112 --> 01:00:51.347
High stepping. Let's go.

1134
01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.349
- High stepping. Let's go!
- I'm sorry. Ow!

1135
01:00:54.382 --> 01:00:56.018
Come on. let's go.

1136
01:00:59.054 --> 01:01:01.757
I guess you got to finally
see the real Hobart.

1137
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:02.958
I do not believe this.

1138
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:05.760
They say Canada is just
the ugly friend of the USA.

1139
01:01:05.793 --> 01:01:07.462
But I loved this ugly friend.

1140
01:01:07.496 --> 01:01:08.798
Yeah. I know.

1141
01:01:09.797 --> 01:01:11.800
They can only fool you
for so long.

1142
01:01:11.833 --> 01:01:12.868
Yeah. I don't understand.

1143
01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:15.438
Hey. Brenda. you're gonna go
make out with Tim Long?

1144
01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:16.304
What?

1145
01:01:16.338 --> 01:01:19.775
No. I have Cape Breton
step dancing.

1146
01:01:19.807 --> 01:01:21.177
I'm nice to them. I say nice...

1147
01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:23.179
Hey. Brenda. Tim Long
is waiting for you.

1148
01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:26.181
- He's just dying to see you.
- And your boobs.

1149
01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:28.084
Like I said. I have
Cape Breton step dance

1150
01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:29.419
on a Wednesday. so...

1151
01:01:31.186 --> 01:01:33.722
Why is everyone asking me
about Tim Long?

1152
01:01:33.755 --> 01:01:36.024
You total dick!

1153
01:01:36.057 --> 01:01:38.260
- Tim.
- Was that supposed to be funny?

1154
01:01:38.293 --> 01:01:40.796
You swapped that stupid video
we made for <i>Le Cercle Rouge.</i>

1155
01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:42.331
- That was my presentation!
- No.

1156
01:01:42.364 --> 01:01:45.067
No. you told me that you wanted
to show the movie to Brenda.

1157
01:01:45.099 --> 01:01:46.201
- What?
- Come on. Long.

1158
01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:47.311
She's right there. hump it out.

1159
01:01:47.335 --> 01:01:50.739
No. I sw... I switched
the movie to push you. huh.

1160
01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:53.409
because I want Brenda to see
how much you like her.

1161
01:01:53.442 --> 01:01:54.976
Okay. what movie?

1162
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:58.214
Stephane swapped <i>Le Cercle Rouge</i>
for this stupid video we took.

1163
01:01:58.246 --> 01:02:00.482
and the whole class saw me say
how much I like your hair

1164
01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:02.985
and your stupid songs and
how much I want to kiss you.

1165
01:02:03.018 --> 01:02:04.253
You did?

1166
01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:07.123
Tim. I was trying to be
a good friend.

1167
01:02:07.155 --> 01:02:08.423
You humiliated me.

1168
01:02:08.456 --> 01:02:11.259
You made me look like
an idiot. You ruined my life.

1169
01:02:11.293 --> 01:02:12.294
You're no friend of mine.

1170
01:02:12.327 --> 01:02:15.096
No. of course.
because you have no friends.

1171
01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:16.798
not me. not anyone.

1172
01:02:16.831 --> 01:02:18.933
You know. what they're
saying about you is true.

1173
01:02:18.967 --> 01:02:20.336
You're a no-friend loser.

1174
01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:23.972
You're a self-centered.
narcissistic. sex crazed.

1175
01:02:24.005 --> 01:02:25.115
- thoroughly absurd...
- What?

1176
01:02:25.139 --> 01:02:27.009
Okay. so you like my hair?

1177
01:02:27.041 --> 01:02:28.810
No. I don't like your hair.

1178
01:02:28.844 --> 01:02:30.246
I... I... I was drunk.

1179
01:02:30.278 --> 01:02:32.414
And he made me say things
I don't mean to say.

1180
01:02:32.447 --> 01:02:35.416
I don't like your hair
or your stupid songs or you!

1181
01:02:35.449 --> 01:02:36.752
I don't like you!

1182
01:02:42.324 --> 01:02:43.326
Brenda.

1183
01:02:44.025 --> 01:02:45.293
Shit.

1184
01:02:45.327 --> 01:02:48.397
You know. I wish
I not choose you.

1185
01:02:48.429 --> 01:02:50.265
huh. or this bucket
of shit place.

1186
01:02:50.298 --> 01:02:52.434
Yeah. well. I wish that. too.

1187
01:02:52.467 --> 01:02:55.872
<i>Va te faire foutre!</i>

1188
01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:10.920
Please. somebody!

1189
01:03:10.952 --> 01:03:13.121
Mom! Mom!

1190
01:03:15.389 --> 01:03:18.360
Where are the Doritos?
And where's Mom?

1191
01:03:23.865 --> 01:03:27.036
"Dearest Tim. I've decided to
move out of the house for a..."

1192
01:03:27.068 --> 01:03:28.403
- What?
- It gets worse.

1193
01:03:29.938 --> 01:03:33.142
Well. maybe not worse.
but it starts bad. stays bad.

1194
01:03:34.476 --> 01:03:37.012
<i>Your dad is a wonderful man.</i>

1195
01:03:37.045 --> 01:03:39.347
<i>but it's been clear
for some time</i>

1196
01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.851
<i>that my life is missing
a certain</i> je ne sais quoi.

1197
01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:44.887
<i>"Je ne sais quoi"?</i>

1198
01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.021
Yeah. <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

1199
01:03:46.054 --> 01:03:47.557
God. fucking Stephane.

1200
01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:50.459
Language.

1201
01:03:53.061 --> 01:03:56.465
<i>I... I couldn't believe I'd
invited this chaos into my life.</i>

1202
01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:05.139
You can come stay with us
for as long as you need.

1203
01:04:05.172 --> 01:04:07.242
Thank you.

1204
01:04:07.275 --> 01:04:09.210
<i>It wasn't just me
shunning Stephane.</i>

1205
01:04:09.244 --> 01:04:12.213
<i>The school had turned
on him. too.</i>

1206
01:04:12.246 --> 01:04:16.217
<i>He'd lost us a soccer match and
called our town a piece of shit.</i>

1207
01:04:16.251 --> 01:04:17.619
<i>Which it might have been.</i>

1208
01:04:17.652 --> 01:04:19.396
<i>but they didn't like hearing
it from someone like him.</i>

1209
01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:23.625
<i>If they were looking for a reason
to turn on a stranger in their town.</i>

1210
01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:25.494
<i>they'd found one.</i>

1211
01:04:44.278 --> 01:04:45.481
Looks good.

1212
01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:46.883
Ah...

1213
01:04:48.416 --> 01:04:51.019
- Hi.
- How are you?

1214
01:04:51.052 --> 01:04:52.387
Yeah. I'm good.

1215
01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.422
Sit down. let's chat.

1216
01:04:55.056 --> 01:04:57.325
Uh. how's Aunt Thelma?

1217
01:04:57.358 --> 01:05:00.596
She snores. One night.
at 4:00 in the morning. she...

1218
01:05:00.628 --> 01:05:02.964
I can't believe Stephane
made you leave.

1219
01:05:02.998 --> 01:05:03.999
What?

1220
01:05:04.032 --> 01:05:04.967
I mean. you know I'm agnostic.

1221
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.168
but I think he might
literally be a demon.

1222
01:05:07.202 --> 01:05:10.139
Tim! Things have not been great

1223
01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:12.608
between your dad and I
for a very long time.

1224
01:05:12.641 --> 01:05:16.144
Okay? Stephane is not to
blame and neither are you.

1225
01:05:16.177 --> 01:05:17.612
Yeah. Nobody's blaming me.

1226
01:05:17.646 --> 01:05:19.448
I'm... I'm great.

1227
01:05:20.248 --> 01:05:23.018
Yeah. you're great.
You're great.

1228
01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:24.329
- Come here.
- Who would blame me?

1229
01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:26.489
Come here.
Nobody is blaming you.

1230
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:28.724
- Sheila?
- Mmm. just a sec.

1231
01:05:28.757 --> 01:05:29.992
Sheila?

1232
01:05:30.592 --> 01:05:31.594
Love you so much.

1233
01:05:32.693 --> 01:05:34.563
Oh. Hey.

1234
01:05:34.596 --> 01:05:35.931
Is that Kevin?

1235
01:05:35.963 --> 01:05:39.467
- Yeah. it's Kevin. Yeah. he looks pissed.
- Just 10 seconds. Please.

1236
01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:41.237
Sheila!

1237
01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:44.572
This better not be about
the fucking acorn. okay?

1238
01:05:44.606 --> 01:05:47.576
- It's not about the acorn.
- Okay.

1239
01:05:47.608 --> 01:05:50.712
You're gonna be at the parade
tomorrow. right? Okay?

1240
01:05:52.079 --> 01:05:54.583
Try to remember that most
people are not really bad

1241
01:05:54.615 --> 01:05:58.152
and not really stupid. okay?

1242
01:05:58.186 --> 01:06:00.356
They're just doing the best
that they can.

1243
01:06:04.092 --> 01:06:05.561
- Yes. Kevin.
- It's about the acorn.

1244
01:06:05.594 --> 01:06:07.628
I knew it was about
the fucking acorn.

1245
01:06:07.661 --> 01:06:11.701
The town. the squirrel
and my life.

1246
01:06:17.639 --> 01:06:18.740
What...

1247
01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:22.979
<i>Putain. merde.</i> shit!

1248
01:06:24.512 --> 01:06:27.281
You know why I come here?

1249
01:06:27.315 --> 01:06:29.650
I thought it would
be different. huh.

1250
01:06:29.684 --> 01:06:31.754
Where I'm from.
the kids who look like me.

1251
01:06:31.786 --> 01:06:34.456
they only hang out with
people who look like me.

1252
01:06:35.523 --> 01:06:36.525
In Hobart.

1253
01:06:37.324 --> 01:06:39.093
it's the same.

1254
01:06:39.126 --> 01:06:41.130
maybe because Hobart is shit.

1255
01:06:41.663 --> 01:06:43.632
Huh. Canada is shit!

1256
01:06:43.664 --> 01:06:46.101
They'll always find a way
to screw you.

1257
01:06:46.134 --> 01:06:49.637
- I... I need to go clear my head.
- Here. take the truck.

1258
01:06:52.673 --> 01:06:53.775
Thank you. Crowfeet.

1259
01:07:00.282 --> 01:07:04.420
<i>The next morning. as everyone
was getting ready for the parade.</i>

1260
01:07:04.452 --> 01:07:06.655
<i>all I could think about
was where Stephane was.</i>

1261
01:07:06.688 --> 01:07:08.791
<i>and who else's life
he might be ruining.</i>

1262
01:07:15.262 --> 01:07:16.531
Whoa.

1263
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:24.472
Okay. we. uh... We gotta...

1264
01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:28.177
- We gotta stay calm.
- Why?

1265
01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.811
It's not fair!

1266
01:07:29.844 --> 01:07:33.648
Kev. it's gonna be okay.
Maybe we can fix it.

1267
01:07:33.681 --> 01:07:37.185
It won't be the same!
They ruined her!

1268
01:07:38.119 --> 01:07:39.153
"Her"?

1269
01:07:39.186 --> 01:07:41.322
Who could do such a thing?

1270
01:07:42.456 --> 01:07:44.092
I'll give you three guesses.

1271
01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.160
Stephane?

1272
01:07:45.193 --> 01:07:47.196
He's not that kind of kid.

1273
01:07:47.728 --> 01:07:48.596
Mmm.

1274
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:51.333
- Is he?
- Well. you tell me.

1275
01:07:51.365 --> 01:07:53.367
There's the head butt. huh?

1276
01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.536
There's the. uh...

1277
01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:58.106
"Fuck
the White Squirrel." right?

1278
01:07:58.139 --> 01:08:02.310
Plus. I saw him hanging
around the town hall at 3:00 this morning.

1279
01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:03.521
So you think Stephane did this?

1280
01:08:03.545 --> 01:08:06.181
What I think is
we don't know shit. son.

1281
01:08:06.213 --> 01:08:07.548
Of course we won't know anything

1282
01:08:07.581 --> 01:08:09.550
until we get
the autopsy results back.

1283
01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:11.452
Appears to be
a single assailant.

1284
01:08:11.485 --> 01:08:13.788
Subcutaneous abrasions
along the right femur there.

1285
01:08:13.822 --> 01:08:16.324
It looks like there's some
flesh underneath the claws.

1286
01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:17.634
which means the victim
did fight back.

1287
01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:18.960
Tell me she didn't suffer.

1288
01:08:18.993 --> 01:08:22.430
Oh. Kevin.
I would love to be able to tell you that.

1289
01:08:22.463 --> 01:08:24.565
but I'm not a liar.

1290
01:08:24.599 --> 01:08:26.502
We don't know anything
about this guy.

1291
01:08:26.534 --> 01:08:28.604
I heard his old man
did some jail time.

1292
01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:30.505
Well. that's true.
It's in his file.

1293
01:08:30.538 --> 01:08:32.740
I read the file too. Gary.

1294
01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:35.577
His dad was arrested
during labor protest.

1295
01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:37.121
- He was the head of the union.
- Mmm-hmm.

1296
01:08:37.145 --> 01:08:40.382
Take this down to the lab. Have the
boys check it for blood. urine. semen.

1297
01:08:40.414 --> 01:08:42.484
- Yes. sir.
- My point exactly.

1298
01:08:42.516 --> 01:08:44.485
Troublemaker. born and bred.

1299
01:08:44.519 --> 01:08:46.755
The apple never falls
far from the tree.

1300
01:08:46.787 --> 01:08:49.824
Okay.
Maybe he came here for a fresh start.

1301
01:08:49.858 --> 01:08:52.528
Fresh start? The only thing he
got fresh with is Herb's daughter.

1302
01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.195
Yeah... What?

1303
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:55.564
Fresh with your daughter.

1304
01:08:57.498 --> 01:08:59.367
Did you have a hand in this?

1305
01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:00.836
What? No. no. no. no.
I haven't...

1306
01:09:00.868 --> 01:09:03.538
He's not staying...
He's staying with the Crowfoots.

1307
01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:05.574
Right. Shooting off guns.

1308
01:09:05.606 --> 01:09:07.242
He hit my car last night.

1309
01:09:07.274 --> 01:09:09.243
Maybe he was aiming
at my gas tank.

1310
01:09:09.277 --> 01:09:10.645
Ka-boom!

1311
01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.681
Make my wife a widow.

1312
01:09:12.713 --> 01:09:14.524
All right. why don't you quit
crying into your Dinky Donuts

1313
01:09:14.548 --> 01:09:16.819
and bring him in. hmm?

1314
01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.487
Sure thing. Gary.

1315
01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:23.458
Yeah. there is no way.
There's no freaking way.

1316
01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:25.527
<i>I know he hated
the White Squirrel. but...</i>

1317
01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.896
Yeah. I know. but he was
with you last night. right?

1318
01:09:27.929 --> 01:09:30.599
Sure. until he took
my brother's truck

1319
01:09:30.631 --> 01:09:33.367
and drove off into
the direction of the town.

1320
01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.569
Super furious. And then.

1321
01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:36.605
he came back
this morning looking...

1322
01:09:36.971 --> 01:09:38.173
Mega-guilty.

1323
01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.743
But still.
there's no freaking way.

1324
01:09:41.775 --> 01:09:43.811
Okay. look. I need you
to do something for me.

1325
01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:46.649
No. I am not doing
anything for you.

1326
01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:48.850
That tractor has sailed.

1327
01:09:48.882 --> 01:09:51.487
Okay. Would you do it
for Stephane?

1328
01:09:56.858 --> 01:09:58.560
<i>Stephane was many things...</i>

1329
01:09:58.592 --> 01:10:01.262
<i>Oversexed.
intellectually bereft.</i>

1330
01:10:01.296 --> 01:10:02.530
<i>permanently erect.</i>

1331
01:10:03.698 --> 01:10:06.602
<i>But I knew he wasn't a liar
or a criminal.</i>

1332
01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:08.904
<i>And I had to make the town
see that. too.</i>

1333
01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:11.606
- Hi.
- Hi.

1334
01:10:19.314 --> 01:10:20.816
Brenda.

1335
01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:23.351
That is crazy. That is so weird.

1336
01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:25.587
Tim Long? What are
the chances of that?

1337
01:10:25.619 --> 01:10:27.322
One in a million. maybe.

1338
01:10:27.354 --> 01:10:30.558
I don't know how he got here.
That's too weird.

1339
01:10:31.292 --> 01:10:32.161
I just can't believe it.

1340
01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:35.697
I... I never knew
this could never happen.

1341
01:10:35.729 --> 01:10:37.465
It's the weirdest thing.

1342
01:10:37.498 --> 01:10:38.934
What do you want. Tim?

1343
01:10:38.966 --> 01:10:41.703
Listen. you're in big trouble. Okay?
Because they think you did that.

1344
01:10:42.369 --> 01:10:43.604
Just like Paris.

1345
01:10:43.637 --> 01:10:46.007
Something go wrong.
blame Stephane.

1346
01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:48.710
The squirrel get broken.
you blame Stephane.

1347
01:10:48.743 --> 01:10:50.612
Money go missing.
you blame Stephane.

1348
01:10:50.645 --> 01:10:53.015
Substitute teacher
gets pregnant.

1349
01:10:53.047 --> 01:10:54.250
blame Stephane.

1350
01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:56.252
What?

1351
01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:59.320
Fuck. Shit.

1352
01:10:59.354 --> 01:11:00.689
- Okay. come on.
- Why?

1353
01:11:00.721 --> 01:11:02.557
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1354
01:11:03.457 --> 01:11:05.326
Okay. Put these on.

1355
01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:09.798
Please. it's your turn
to trust me.

1356
01:11:23.043 --> 01:11:25.514
I can't see shit.
Which way are we going?

1357
01:11:25.546 --> 01:11:27.648
If you're gonna let
your kids come to the parade.

1358
01:11:27.681 --> 01:11:29.984
you can't let 'em play
with the beaver tails. okay?

1359
01:11:30.018 --> 01:11:31.653
They play
with their bottoms all day.

1360
01:11:31.685 --> 01:11:33.531
next thing you know.
there's baby shit in the beaver.

1361
01:11:33.555 --> 01:11:35.291
That's why you don't adopt.

1362
01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:41.730
I went to the Crowfoots'.
and he was already gone.

1363
01:11:43.931 --> 01:11:45.800
Damn it. Herb.
You had one job to do.

1364
01:11:45.833 --> 01:11:47.868
- I'm sorry. Gary.
- Mmm-hmm.

1365
01:11:47.902 --> 01:11:49.805
I saw their truck
on the edge of town.

1366
01:11:49.837 --> 01:11:51.005
He might be here somewhere.

1367
01:11:51.038 --> 01:11:53.774
No shit. He's probably trying
to finish what he started.

1368
01:11:53.807 --> 01:11:55.609
He only wants to ruin
our whole damn parade.

1369
01:11:55.643 --> 01:11:56.810
- He wouldn't.
- He wouldn't?

1370
01:11:56.844 --> 01:12:00.114
Oh. he hates this town.
and everything we stand for. Herb.

1371
01:12:00.148 --> 01:12:03.685
Peace. freedom.
more traditional way of life.

1372
01:12:03.717 --> 01:12:05.320
- Hi. Gary.
- Kev.

1373
01:12:05.987 --> 01:12:08.824
Now. listen. I want you to do

1374
01:12:08.856 --> 01:12:11.859
a thorough sweep of the
entire parade route. okay?

1375
01:12:11.893 --> 01:12:15.130
And you let me know when you
have eyes on that son of a bitch.

1376
01:12:15.162 --> 01:12:16.263
Yes. sir.

1377
01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.849
Tim! Tim! Tim!
Where are we going?

1378
01:12:33.881 --> 01:12:34.817
What's the plan. Tim?

1379
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.885
People will hear the accent!

1380
01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:38.586
I don't have accent.
you have accent!

1381
01:12:38.619 --> 01:12:41.556
Hey. guys. I actually
can't see anything. so...

1382
01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:43.824
SOS!

1383
01:12:43.858 --> 01:12:45.594
Tim. Brenda is falling.

1384
01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:46.662
Oh. fuck!

1385
01:12:46.694 --> 01:12:47.705
Let me help you up.
Give me your hand.

1386
01:12:47.729 --> 01:12:50.065
Hey. that Mexican fuck
is actually that Arab fuck!

1387
01:12:50.097 --> 01:12:52.466
No. no. no. I am a Mexican.

1388
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.702
Uh. <i>por favor!</i>

1389
01:12:53.734 --> 01:12:54.769
Hey. it's him!

1390
01:12:54.802 --> 01:12:55.970
That's him!

1391
01:12:56.003 --> 01:12:57.838
That's the perp!

1392
01:12:57.872 --> 01:12:59.474
Fuck.

1393
01:12:59.506 --> 01:13:01.475
Fuck! Fuck!

1394
01:13:01.509 --> 01:13:03.412
Get out of my way.
Get out of my way.

1395
01:13:03.444 --> 01:13:05.880
<i>Right then. I knew I had
to stand up for Stephane.</i>

1396
01:13:05.913 --> 01:13:08.182
<i>and make the town see
what I saw in him.</i>

1397
01:13:08.216 --> 01:13:10.085
<i>because that's what friends do
for each other.</i>

1398
01:13:10.118 --> 01:13:11.720
Stop the parade! Stop.

1399
01:13:11.752 --> 01:13:13.354
Stop the parade.

1400
01:13:13.387 --> 01:13:15.765
What are we dancing for?
I didn't know there was gonna be a dance.

1401
01:13:15.789 --> 01:13:16.824
Stop.

1402
01:13:16.858 --> 01:13:18.760
This is fun. but who is that?

1403
01:13:18.792 --> 01:13:20.036
What do you think
I'm doing? Stop.

1404
01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.163
I'm not dancing.
Stop the parade.

1405
01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:23.698
Stop the...

1406
01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:25.099
Stop the friggin' parade.

1407
01:13:25.132 --> 01:13:27.435
What are you doing. Long?

1408
01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:28.537
Hey. Gary.

1409
01:13:29.203 --> 01:13:30.838
Look what the cat dragged in.

1410
01:13:30.872 --> 01:13:32.908
No. no. no. Let him go. please.

1411
01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:33.908
Let him go. Please. let him go.

1412
01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:37.179
- You're ruining my parade.
- Just hold on.

1413
01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:39.148
<i>Uh...</i>

1414
01:13:40.782 --> 01:13:41.784
<i>Okay.</i>

1415
01:13:47.488 --> 01:13:48.656
<i>Okay.</i>

1416
01:13:48.689 --> 01:13:52.760
<i>Now I know I've never been the
most popular kid in school...</i>

1417
01:13:52.793 --> 01:13:53.996
No shit!

1418
01:13:54.662 --> 01:13:55.730
<i>Okay.</i>

1419
01:13:55.762 --> 01:13:58.600
<i>Uh. and I know a lot of you
probably think I'm some...</i>

1420
01:13:58.632 --> 01:13:59.434
You're a creep!

1421
01:13:59.466 --> 01:14:00.835
- Nerd.
- That's right.

1422
01:14:00.868 --> 01:14:02.804
Go make another tape.
you pervert.

1423
01:14:02.837 --> 01:14:04.106
Go bang Brenda.

1424
01:14:04.838 --> 01:14:06.073
Everyone hates you.

1425
01:14:07.574 --> 01:14:09.109
<i>Okay.</i>

1426
01:14:09.143 --> 01:14:11.813
<i>Well. uh. I just want
to say that Stephane...</i>

1427
01:14:13.014 --> 01:14:16.551
<i>Stephane Belmade is my friend.
and he's a really great guy.</i>

1428
01:14:16.583 --> 01:14:18.052
<i>Okay. come on.</i>

1429
01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:20.756
<i>And I know he would never
do that to the squirrel.</i>

1430
01:14:21.756 --> 01:14:23.557
But how do you know. Tim?

1431
01:14:23.591 --> 01:14:24.660
Yeah!

1432
01:14:27.228 --> 01:14:29.631
<i>Because... Because I just know.</i>

1433
01:14:30.664 --> 01:14:31.733
<i>I just know.</i>

1434
01:14:37.872 --> 01:14:40.842
<i>And if you're not willing
to give a visitor to our town</i>

1435
01:14:40.875 --> 01:14:41.909
<i>the benefit of the doubt.</i>

1436
01:14:41.943 --> 01:14:44.880
<i>then I'm not sure I have
anything left to say to you.</i>

1437
01:14:44.912 --> 01:14:45.980
Okey-doke.

1438
01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:47.548
<i>Wait. no. wait.
Can you stop. please?</i>

1439
01:14:47.582 --> 01:14:50.818
<i>It's a figure of speech.
I have a little bit more to say.</i>

1440
01:14:52.753 --> 01:14:56.190
<i>Stephane Belmade has done
so much for so many of us.</i>

1441
01:14:56.858 --> 01:14:58.592
<i>Yeah.</i>

1442
01:14:58.627 --> 01:15:02.230
<i>You know. he came here and he was
ready to see the best in all of us.</i>

1443
01:15:02.262 --> 01:15:04.131
<i>but we chose to see
the worst in him</i>

1444
01:15:04.164 --> 01:15:06.935
<i>because of what.
because of the way he looks.</i>

1445
01:15:06.967 --> 01:15:08.269
<i>But. look. it's not too late.</i>

1446
01:15:08.302 --> 01:15:11.006
<i>We can launch a full-scale
investigation. we could...</i>

1447
01:15:11.038 --> 01:15:13.073
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
we know what he did.

1448
01:15:13.106 --> 01:15:14.509
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1449
01:15:14.542 --> 01:15:17.279
I saw him break into town hall
yelling. "Fuck ze White Squirrel!"

1450
01:15:17.311 --> 01:15:18.555
- <i>Okay.</i>
- "Fuck it. Fuck it hard!"

1451
01:15:18.579 --> 01:15:21.815
<i>Okay. that can't be true.
Stephane. where were you last night?</i>

1452
01:15:21.849 --> 01:15:22.984
Yeah.

1453
01:15:23.016 --> 01:15:24.552
Tell us.

1454
01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:28.088
I cannot say
where I was. <i>Desole.</i>

1455
01:15:28.122 --> 01:15:29.925
Herb. take him away.

1456
01:15:29.957 --> 01:15:30.991
- <i>Wait.</i>
- Yes. sir.

1457
01:15:31.024 --> 01:15:32.693
- <i>No. no. no.</i>
- Wait!

1458
01:15:33.694 --> 01:15:34.695
Glenn?

1459
01:15:35.162 --> 01:15:36.797
Stephane was with me.

1460
01:15:36.831 --> 01:15:37.899
- Come on.
- What?

1461
01:15:37.931 --> 01:15:39.733
And thank
friggin' Christ he was.

1462
01:15:39.766 --> 01:15:42.002
Where to begin? Uh...

1463
01:15:42.036 --> 01:15:43.570
Seven years ago.

1464
01:15:43.604 --> 01:15:47.775
the Canadian government made a series
of disastrous economic decisions...

1465
01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:48.844
<i>Dad!</i>

1466
01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:51.613
<i>Maybe... Maybe start
nearer the end.</i>

1467
01:15:51.645 --> 01:15:54.748
Smart boy. I just wanted
to give them a bit of context.

1468
01:15:54.782 --> 01:15:57.185
put a backstory there. but.
uh...

1469
01:15:57.217 --> 01:15:59.787
<i>Hello? Um...</i>

1470
01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:01.288
<i>Like a lot of youse.</i>

1471
01:16:01.322 --> 01:16:04.059
<i>I've got a business
that's going under.</i>

1472
01:16:04.091 --> 01:16:07.628
<i>Last night. I was desperate.
on the verge of losing everything.</i>

1473
01:16:10.097 --> 01:16:11.233
Hey!

1474
01:16:13.134 --> 01:16:15.136
Glenn. what are you doing. huh?

1475
01:16:15.168 --> 01:16:17.204
<i>Stephane threw me in a chair.</i>

1476
01:16:17.238 --> 01:16:20.876
<i>made me some coffee and
talked some sense into me.</i>

1477
01:16:24.444 --> 01:16:28.782
<i>"Glenn.
you get caught. you go to jail!"</i>

1478
01:16:28.815 --> 01:16:33.253
<i>"You cannot do that to Tim and to Sheila.
They love you so much."</i>

1479
01:16:33.287 --> 01:16:36.157
<i>Uh. I can't really
do the accent that good.</i>

1480
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:39.094
<i>Anyways. he sat with me
all night.</i>

1481
01:16:39.127 --> 01:16:43.164
<i>He didn't leave my side. did you.
my little French buddy?</i>

1482
01:16:43.197 --> 01:16:45.233
Mr. Long's telling the truth!

1483
01:16:45.265 --> 01:16:47.134
There's a bonfire in there!

1484
01:16:47.167 --> 01:16:48.402
Hold on a moment.

1485
01:16:48.435 --> 01:16:50.371
You couldn't have seen Stephane.

1486
01:16:50.404 --> 01:16:54.141
So. where did you spend
last night. Gary?

1487
01:16:54.375 --> 01:16:55.243
Me?

1488
01:16:55.275 --> 01:16:56.612
Fuck.

1489
01:16:57.712 --> 01:16:58.880
Uh...

1490
01:16:58.912 --> 01:16:59.980
I was with Diane.

1491
01:17:00.014 --> 01:17:01.682
Of course. we were. uh...

1492
01:17:02.216 --> 01:17:03.752
Engaging in...

1493
01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:06.287
Rather heavy petting.

1494
01:17:06.319 --> 01:17:11.893
that led to full-blown.
penetrative intercourse.

1495
01:17:11.926 --> 01:17:13.094
Are you insane?

1496
01:17:13.127 --> 01:17:15.730
I am right here.
and that didn't happen.

1497
01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:21.936
Could have happened.

1498
01:17:25.038 --> 01:17:26.440
Hey!

1499
01:17:26.474 --> 01:17:28.143
Don't let him get away!

1500
01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:30.412
Oh!

1501
01:17:34.047 --> 01:17:37.652
<i>I'm sure you can guess who
actually did destroy the squirrel.</i>

1502
01:17:50.931 --> 01:17:54.769
<i>By dinner time. everyone just
forgot their race-based witch-hunt.</i>

1503
01:17:54.801 --> 01:17:57.204
<i>their xenophobic rush
to judgment.</i>

1504
01:17:57.238 --> 01:18:00.175
<i>their ethnically-motivated
vigilantism...</i>

1505
01:18:00.207 --> 01:18:01.710
<i>You get the point.</i>

1506
01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:04.179
Tim Long. you stand up for me.

1507
01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:05.814
In front of the whole town.

1508
01:18:07.515 --> 01:18:09.951
These people. they hate you.

1509
01:18:09.984 --> 01:18:11.186
No. I...

1510
01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:12.319
I wouldn't say "Hate."

1511
01:18:12.353 --> 01:18:13.186
<i>Oui. Oui. oui.</i>

1512
01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:15.255
They said terrible things
about you.

1513
01:18:15.288 --> 01:18:18.358
"Tim Long is a bookworm."
"Tim Long is a loser."

1514
01:18:18.391 --> 01:18:22.362
"Tim Long is needle-dicked.
four-eyes shit boy."

1515
01:18:22.395 --> 01:18:24.198
I actually haven't heard
that one.

1516
01:18:24.231 --> 01:18:26.467
Terrible things.
Me. I don't say these things

1517
01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:27.577
- because...
- Who said "Shit boy?"

1518
01:18:27.601 --> 01:18:31.072
Well. once. because we are
<i>meilleurs copains.</i>

1519
01:18:31.104 --> 01:18:32.440
<i>Meilleurs copains.</i>

1520
01:18:34.809 --> 01:18:35.811
I guess we are.

1521
01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.985
Oh. God. Okay. I've gotta...

1522
01:18:46.253 --> 01:18:48.922
I gotta do something.

1523
01:18:48.956 --> 01:18:51.259
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

1524
01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:53.994
Go get her. Tim Long.

1525
01:18:58.966 --> 01:19:02.270
Why didn't you tell me about the
business going in the crapper?

1526
01:19:03.237 --> 01:19:04.739
'Cause I'm an idiot.

1527
01:19:06.039 --> 01:19:07.876
We might have to sell the house.

1528
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:09.844
Mmm.

1529
01:19:09.877 --> 01:19:11.980
We've rented before.

1530
01:19:12.012 --> 01:19:15.015
Maybe your mom will die soon too.
She's got cash. right?

1531
01:19:19.953 --> 01:19:21.021
We'll figure it out.

1532
01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:22.757
We always do.

1533
01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:26.994
We still got
what's most important.

1534
01:19:32.399 --> 01:19:36.003
You're... You're talking about
us being together. right?

1535
01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:38.472
- Yes. Glenn.
- Yeah.

1536
01:19:38.506 --> 01:19:41.777
Well. maybe we should tell Tim
that we've patched things up.

1537
01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:45.445
Oh. I mean...

1538
01:19:45.479 --> 01:19:48.149
We've started the difficult
and painful journey

1539
01:19:48.181 --> 01:19:50.018
towards patching things up.

1540
01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:51.052
Yeah.

1541
01:19:53.988 --> 01:19:55.390
Yeah. yeah. Good.

1542
01:19:57.925 --> 01:19:58.927
Hello. Tim Long.

1543
01:20:01.061 --> 01:20:05.332
I thought what you did
today was not un-heroic.

1544
01:20:05.365 --> 01:20:07.002
and maybe...

1545
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:12.873
I... I... I'm really
sorry. Brenda.

1546
01:20:12.907 --> 01:20:17.412
I... I do like your hair.
and your crazy songs. and I...

1547
01:20:30.190 --> 01:20:31.425
Hi.

1548
01:20:31.458 --> 01:20:33.595
Don't let us stop you.

1549
01:20:33.627 --> 01:20:36.197
They were watching
the whole time?

1550
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:37.307
It's a good technique. huh?

1551
01:20:37.331 --> 01:20:38.867
Not bad.

1552
01:20:38.899 --> 01:20:41.201
I can... I can feel
you looking. Please stop.

1553
01:20:41.234 --> 01:20:43.604
I don't know...
I don't know why you're staring.

1554
01:20:43.637 --> 01:20:45.207
We're very proud of you.

1555
01:20:56.984 --> 01:20:58.019
All right.

1556
01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:01.289
All right.

1557
01:21:01.322 --> 01:21:03.324
- "All right" what?
- Just hold still.

1558
01:21:03.356 --> 01:21:04.559
Okay.

1559
01:21:17.137 --> 01:21:21.442
<i>The rest of Stephane's stay
with us was. well. kind of terrific.</i>

1560
01:21:21.475 --> 01:21:24.045
<i>Some of the best times
I've ever had.</i>

1561
01:21:29.582 --> 01:21:31.117
You know. if you look closely.

1562
01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:36.557
you can see the framing's really been
influenced by Godard and Truffaut...

1563
01:21:38.492 --> 01:21:40.528
I made a mistake. Okay?

1564
01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.230
So. you haul me in.

1565
01:21:43.264 --> 01:21:45.667
If the coach hadn't dropped
me for the play-offs.

1566
01:21:45.699 --> 01:21:47.668
you wouldn't be staring
at me right here.

1567
01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.971
broken. humiliated. soiled.

1568
01:21:51.137 --> 01:21:54.341
<i>But like all of life's
loveliest things.</i>

1569
01:21:54.375 --> 01:21:56.310
<i>it was over way too soon.</i>

1570
01:21:56.344 --> 01:21:57.979
Oh. I'm so sorry we weren't up

1571
01:21:58.011 --> 01:21:59.579
to your high standards.
Jean-Claude...

1572
01:21:59.613 --> 01:22:03.451
Terrible cuisine. terrible
town. terrible country.

1573
01:22:04.051 --> 01:22:05.553
Screw you!

1574
01:22:05.586 --> 01:22:07.055
Let's go.

1575
01:22:09.489 --> 01:22:10.590
Hey. look.

1576
01:22:10.623 --> 01:22:12.492
It's the Hobart posse. huh?

1577
01:22:12.525 --> 01:22:14.194
Hey!

1578
01:22:14.228 --> 01:22:16.530
There you are.

1579
01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:18.199
We came to say goodbye.

1580
01:22:19.332 --> 01:22:20.501
And we're sorry.

1581
01:22:21.368 --> 01:22:24.304
We drew certain conclusions

1582
01:22:24.337 --> 01:22:26.106
based on you being different.

1583
01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:27.208
And that's wrong.

1584
01:22:28.274 --> 01:22:30.577
In Hobart. we pride ourselves

1585
01:22:30.610 --> 01:22:32.279
in treating everyone equally.

1586
01:22:32.313 --> 01:22:34.382
regardless of race.

1587
01:22:40.387 --> 01:22:41.689
Oh. you're being serious.

1588
01:22:42.489 --> 01:22:44.324
What we mean is. uh.

1589
01:22:44.358 --> 01:22:46.226
we were wrong.

1590
01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:48.329
I will miss this Hobart.

1591
01:22:48.362 --> 01:22:50.530
I want to make love
on all of you.

1592
01:22:50.564 --> 01:22:51.999
Thank you.

1593
01:22:52.032 --> 01:22:53.768
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen. this is the last call</i>

1594
01:22:53.801 --> 01:22:56.338
<i>for flight number 827 to Paris.</i>

1595
01:22:59.073 --> 01:23:00.084
We're gonna miss you. buddy.

1596
01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:02.644
<i>Bonne chance.</i>
my brown-skinned friend.

1597
01:23:07.814 --> 01:23:09.550
We are <i>meilleurs copains.</i>

1598
01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:11.251
Best friends.

1599
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:16.191
I'll go now.

1600
01:23:17.123 --> 01:23:18.126
Yeah.

1601
01:23:23.663 --> 01:23:24.765
I'll write to you.

1602
01:23:24.798 --> 01:23:26.466
I'll write to you. Tim Long.

1603
01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.469
And I'll use the big words
you teach me.

1604
01:23:28.502 --> 01:23:29.671
Diaphanous.

1605
01:23:30.837 --> 01:23:32.773
<i>Stephane might not
have been what I wanted.</i>

1606
01:23:32.806 --> 01:23:34.775
<i>but it turned out
he was what I needed.</i>

1607
01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:37.244
<i>And I think he needed me too.</i>

1608
01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:39.646
<i>He might not have
enlightened me on Truffaut</i>

1609
01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.516
- <i>or how to conjugate a verb...</i>
- Hey.

1610
01:23:41.548 --> 01:23:44.217
<i>But he taught me things
I'll never forget.</i>

1611
01:23:44.251 --> 01:23:45.353
<i>About love.</i>

1612
01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:47.622
<i>life.</i>

1613
01:23:47.654 --> 01:23:49.090
<i>second chances...</i>

1614
01:23:49.122 --> 01:23:51.025
- Bye. Stephane.
- Bye. Tim Long.

1615
01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:54.494
<i>And how to undo
a bra with one hand.</i>

1616
01:23:54.528 --> 01:23:55.596
Sexy nerd couple.

1617
01:24:12.412 --> 01:24:14.648
Tim Long.
are you wearing cologne?

1618
01:24:15.716 --> 01:24:18.453
Yeah. Yeah. well.
you know what they say.

1619
01:24:18.485 --> 01:24:22.356
"Before sex happens in the
pants. it happens in the nose."

1620
01:24:23.123 --> 01:24:25.393
Oh.

1621
01:24:26.359 --> 01:24:27.862
<i>As I waved goodbye.</i>

1622
01:24:27.895 --> 01:24:31.732
<i>I didn't know whether
it was</i> au revoir <i>or</i> adieu.

1623
01:24:31.765 --> 01:24:34.602
<i>But I did know that
Stephane had changed my life...</i>

1624
01:24:35.235 --> 01:24:36.237
<i>Forever.</i>

1625
01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:50.818
Bonjour! <i>We made it to Paris.</i>

1626
01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:54.721

culture and all that is good.</i>

1627
01:24:54.755 --> 01:24:56.623

1631
01:25:02.296 --> 01:25:04.731
<i>Hey. Tim. you come
jerk me off. huh?</i>

1632
01:25:04.765 --> 01:25:06.501
