you another question.

271
00:11:46.016 --> 00:11:47.509
Why you decided to tell me this?

272
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:49.426
- Because I'm pregnant.

273
00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:52.969

274
00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:01.036

- I'm gonna go outside.

327
00:14:30.231 --> 00:14:34.071
- I spoke with Devin's
mother the other day.

328
00:14:34.071 --> 00:14:37.404
She's devastated about that boy's death.

329

But listen seriously.

366
00:16:11.976 --> 00:16:13.225
I just talked to Bender.

367
00:16:13.225 --> 00:16:14.438
He said that we have to have this case

368
00:16:14.438 --> 00:16:16.897

369
00:16:16.897 --> 00:16:18.457
- Really?

370
00:16:18.457 --> 00:16:20.368

371
00:16:20.368 --> 00:16:21.587
- I don't know.

372
00:16:21.587 --> 00:16:23.968
I guess he's getting
pressure from Washington.

373
00:16:23.968 --> 00:16:27.442
Listen. are you gonna

378
00:16:34.067 --> 00:16:35.377
I wanted to familiarize myself

379
00:16:35.377 --> 00:16:37.768

380
00:16:37.768 --> 00:16:41.362

381
00:16:41.362 --> 00:16:44.368

00:24:57.528 --> 00:24:59.022
You made sure you didn't
have a tail. right?

548
00:24:59.022 --> 00:25:00.752
- Of course.

549
00:25:00.752 --> 00:25:02.456
- Hey baby.
- Hey.

550
00:25:02.456 --> 00:25:03.486

551
00:25:03.486 --> 00:25:04.319

552
00:25:04.319 --> 00:25:05.152
- Yeah. yeah.

553
00:25:05.152 --> 00:25:06.267
- I know I saw you earlier.

554
00:25:06.267 --> 00:25:09.860
but just got a million things on my mind

555
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.273
like.

556
00:25:11.273 --> 00:25:12.106
the baby.

557
00:25:13.441 --> 00:25:17.024
what we're gonna do
and our lives together.

558
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:21.101
Baby. are you listening?

559
00:25:22.056 --> 00:25:25.137
- Yeah. yeah.
I'm listening baby.

560
00:25:25.137 --> 00:25:27.805
Just got a lot of shit on my
head about my father. you know?

561
00:25:27.805 --> 00:25:28.655
- Oh. I'm sorry.

562
00:25:28.655 --> 00:25:30.156
You probably don't want
to talk about this.

563
00:25:30.156 --> 00:25:31.568
- No. no. it's good. it's good.

564
00:25:31.568 --> 00:25:32.580
How did your day go?

565
00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.593
What's up?

566
00:25:33.593 --> 00:25:34.599
- It's okay.

567
00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:37.278
I mean. I threw up a bunch of times. but

568
00:25:37.278 --> 00:25:39.134
that was fine.

569
00:25:39.134 --> 00:25:40.424
And I came closer to executing

570
00:25:40.424 --> 00:25:42.528
that plan we talked about so.

571
00:25:42.528 --> 00:25:44.182
- Nice. nice.

572
00:25:44.182 --> 00:25:45.116
- Thank you.

573
00:25:45.116 --> 00:25:46.731
- You know what. babe.

574
00:25:46.731 --> 00:25:49.038
I've been thinking. you know.

575
00:25:49.038 --> 00:25:53.162
I'm thinking a lot about
me and you. you know

576
00:25:53.162 --> 00:25:54.900
I have a lot of my mind. you know.

577
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:55.733
- Yeah.

578
00:25:55.733 --> 00:25:57.588
- Thinking about me. you

579
00:25:57.588 --> 00:26:00.223
this child we got coming.

580
00:26:00.223 --> 00:26:02.697
- I want us to be a family. you know?

581
00:26:02.697 --> 00:26:03.530
- Really?

582
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.172
- Yeah. I want us to be a family.

583
00:26:05.172 --> 00:26:09.130
I want to take care of
you. I always knew that.

584
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.130
I get put in this situation one day.

585
00:26:13.154 --> 00:26:15.062
I'll stand up and be a man about it.

586
00:26:15.062 --> 00:26:17.735
take care of my responsibilities.

587
00:26:17.735 --> 00:26:20.318
- Baby. that makes me so happy.

588
00:26:27.506 --> 00:26:30.504
- Man. I always wanted a
little brother and sister.

589
00:26:30.504 --> 00:26:33.754
I cannot wait to visit them in Detroit.

590
00:26:34.722 --> 00:26:37.805
So what are the doctors saying daddy?

591
00:26:38.732 --> 00:26:40.882
they can save you. right?

592
00:26:40.882 --> 00:26:45.026
- It's one of the reasons
I came to see you. baby

593
00:26:45.026 --> 00:26:46.859
It's not looking good.

594
00:26:47.709 --> 00:26:50.376
They say I don't have much time.

595
00:26:51.419 --> 00:26:53.950
Since the cancer has spread to

596
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:57.001
several organs within my body.

597
00:26:57.001 --> 00:27:00.001
They really can't say at this point.

598
00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.683
- I'm so sorry. daddy.

599
00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.529
- It's okay baby.

600
00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:07.959
Who knows?

601
00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:09.459
I might beat this.

602
00:27:10.459 --> 00:27:14.626
God has the final say of
who lives or dies. right?

603
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.341
I might be getting my just desserts.

604
00:27:22.341 --> 00:27:24.039
- No. you're not daddy.

605
00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:26.267
Please. don't say stuff like that.

606
00:27:26.267 --> 00:27:28.220
Let's just pray that
God has another outcome

607
00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.506
than what the doctors are saying.

608
00:27:31.506 --> 00:27:33.173
- And if he doesn't?

609
00:27:34.466 --> 00:27:35.668
- We'll just have to make the best

610
00:27:35.668 --> 00:27:39.136

611

00:38:07.073 --> 00:38:08.889
- I thought you was your sister.

825
00:38:08.889 --> 00:38:12.242
Y'all both have the same
light walk as your grandma.

826
00:38:12.242 --> 00:38:13.820
So where are you coming from?

827
00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.529
- I had to meet somebody for lunch.

828
00:38:16.529 --> 00:38:18.909
I figured out. come by and see you

829
00:38:18.909 --> 00:38:20.408
before you go see grandma.

830
00:38:20.408 --> 00:38:22.191
- That's so sweet of you son.

831
00:38:22.191 --> 00:38:24.762
- I see Keysha done
practically moved in here.

832
00:38:24.762 --> 00:38:26.323
- Not really.

833
00:38:26.323 --> 00:38:28.422
you know she's here every day.

834
00:38:28.422 --> 00:38:29.963
- Yeah. I see.

835
00:38:29.963 --> 00:38:32.374
- And it doesn't help with
what she's going through.

836
00:38:32.374 --> 00:38:34.452
thinking about your father.

837
00:38:34.452 --> 00:38:36.148
- She'll be all right mom.

838
00:38:36.148 --> 00:38:39.516
- I just wish she hadn't
told her about the cancer.

839
00:38:39.516 --> 00:38:42.766
It's torturing that girl on the inside.

840
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:44.884
- Cancer?

841
00:38:46.074 --> 00:38:47.812

844
00:38:53.221 --> 00:38:54.638
That's messed up.

845
00:38:56.996 --> 00:39:00.091
I actually feel sorry for the dude.

846
00:39:00.091 --> 00:39:02.073
How long did they give him?

847
00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:02.990
- Not long.

848
00:39:07.472 --> 00:39:08.305
Baby.

849
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.292
I just want you to promise me

850
00:39:11.292 --> 00:39:13.820
that whatever feelings you have about him.

851
00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:14.653
you won't allow them to interfere

852
00:39:14.653 --> 00:39:15.486
with what your sister
may be going through.

853
00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:16.708
Okay?

854
00:39:20.572 --> 00:39:21.405

863
00:39:38.258 --> 00:39:39.892
- What the fuck.

864
00:39:39.892 --> 00:39:43.041
(group chattering)

865
00:39:43.041 --> 00:39:45.200
I thought you said this
was supposed to be.

866
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.121
What the fuck

867
00:39:46.121 --> 00:39:48.940
(shoes squeaking)

868
00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.107
What the fuck.

869
00:39:51.121 --> 00:39:53.531
I'm Fox motherfucking P. nigga.

00:39:53.531 --> 00:39:55.313
The whole city know me.

00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:58.991
You hear me. man.

873
00:39:58.991 --> 00:40:01.651
- It's glad to see you
officers made here safely.

874
00:40:01.651 --> 00:40:03.292
(chuckles)

875
00:40:03.292 --> 00:40:04.594
- Man get the hell out of here.

876
00:40:04.594 --> 00:40:05.492
How'd that other thing go?

877
00:40:05.492 --> 00:40:08.011
- Everything is copasetic.

878
00:40:08.011 --> 00:40:09.511
Homie checked out.

879
00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:12.922
See. what you don't know is.

880
00:40:12.922 --> 00:40:14.172
your other little brother.

881
00:40:14.172 --> 00:40:16.461
We clipped his ass while
he was getting some pussy.

882
00:40:16.461 --> 00:40:19.251
And it's sad to say that
y'all not gone go that smooth

883
00:40:19.251 --> 00:40:21.721
Guess it's fucked up being
the older brothers huh.

884
00:40:21.721 --> 00:40:22.638
- Oh. yeah.

885
00:40:24.752 --> 00:40:27.811
Hey. man. cut me the fuck up
off these motherfuckers. man.

886
00:40:27.811 --> 00:40:30.134

887
00:40:30.134 --> 00:40:32.761
Good night. nigga.
- You niggas gone have to kill me.

888
00:40:32.761 --> 00:40:33.653
You niggas gone have to kill me

889
00:40:33.653 --> 00:40:36.570
(gun shot roaring)

890
00:40:39.257 --> 00:40:42.090
( Tiahmo roaring)

891
00:40:47.185 --> 00:40:50.137
- All right. we have no more
time ladies and gentlemen.

892
00:40:50.137 --> 00:40:51.520
these people have gone completely mad

893
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.421
and it starting to make us look bad.

894
00:40:53.421 --> 00:40:55.113
Many things that the
Bureau is moving too slow

895
00:40:55.113 --> 00:40:57.613
on the investigation of these individuals.

896
00:40:57.613 --> 00:41:00.529
Thus making for a relaxed environment.

897
00:41:00.529 --> 00:41:03.363
which is causing all the
violence surrounding our case.

898
00:41:03.363 --> 00:41:06.346
- So do you think we're ready?

899
00:41:06.346 --> 00:41:08.445
- At this point agent. we have no choice.

900
00:41:08.445 --> 00:41:10.220
We'll have to go with what we have

901
00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.917
which I believe is enough to put them away

902
00:41:11.917 --> 00:41:14.055
for a substantial amount of time.

903
00:41:14.055 --> 00:41:15.756
I want you guys to secure body warrants

904
00:41:15.756 --> 00:41:17.537
for all six of these.

905
00:41:17.537 --> 00:41:20.724
We'll need them by this afternoon.

906
00:41:20.724 --> 00:41:21.895
Let's get moving people.

907
00:41:21.895 --> 00:41:23.190
I don't want any excuses.

908
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.857
I want them in the city by 1300.

909
00:41:26.744 --> 00:41:31.661
- Yeah. so I'll be meeting the
Marshals there this evening.

910
00:41:32.897 --> 00:41:35.765
Yes. I'll call you when I get there.

911
00:41:35.765 --> 00:41:37.098
Okay. Thank you.

912
00:41:43.031 --> 00:41:43.864
- Baby.

913
00:41:45.295 --> 00:41:48.066
I had a meeting with my boss this morning

914
00:41:48.066 --> 00:41:49.680
and

915
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.836
they're talking indictments.

916
00:41:52.836 --> 00:41:54.658
agents are going to round up the girls now

917
00:41:54.658 --> 00:41:57.483
to try and get them to testify.

918
00:41:57.483 --> 00:41:58.816
- What the fuck?

919
00:42:01.402 --> 00:42:02.235
Already.

920
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:04.662
shit man.

921
00:42:07.984 --> 00:42:10.024
I don't get it.

922
00:42:10.024 --> 00:42:11.659
Why so soon?

923
00:42:11.659 --> 00:42:14.401
- I mean. with the way the
guys were found this morning.

924
00:42:14.401 --> 00:42:15.823
we're getting pressure from everywhere

925
00:42:15.823 --> 00:42:18.736
to wrap this case up
and bring everybody in.

926
00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:19.986
But baby. baby.

927
00:42:21.596 --> 00:42:23.519
you have nothing to worry about.

928
00:42:23.519 --> 00:42:24.651
As long as none of the girls say

929
00:42:24.651 --> 00:42:26.277
that you acted as a pimp.

930
00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:27.527
you'll be fine.

931
00:42:30.251 --> 00:42:32.251
- Yeah. I understand but

932
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.189
what about that punk hoe Paris?

933
00:42:37.189 --> 00:42:38.965
I know they looking for her too.

934
00:42:38.965 --> 00:42:41.223
- Don't worry about her.

935
00:42:41.223 --> 00:42:42.306
- Okay. cool.

936
00:42:44.947 --> 00:42:46.252
- And I have to head out. baby

937
00:42:46.252 --> 00:42:48.103
cause I have so much stuff to get done.

938
00:42:48.103 --> 00:42:50.332
and only have a few hours to get it done.

939
00:42:50.332 --> 00:42:51.323
I'm gonna call you.

940
00:42:51.323 --> 00:42:52.554
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

941
00:42:52.554 --> 00:42:54.453
I'll give you all the updates

942
00:42:54.453 --> 00:42:56.383
and don't have anything illegal on you.

943
00:42:56.383 --> 00:42:57.842
No illegal contraband.

944
00:42:57.842 --> 00:42:59.722
They can pick you up at
any moment. you know.

945
00:42:59.722 --> 00:43:02.384
We don't wanna give them anything else.

946
00:43:02.384 --> 00:43:04.301
- All right. all right.

947
00:43:05.632 --> 00:43:06.465
Okay.

948
00:43:07.983 --> 00:43:10.400
Well. I'll talk to you later.

949
00:43:31.305 --> 00:43:34.805
(camera shutter clicking)

950
00:43:43.285 --> 00:43:45.368
- You leave me no choice.

951
00:43:53.434 --> 00:43:56.517
(car engine revving)

952
00:44:15.685 --> 00:44:18.435
(car door bangs)

953
00:44:29.553 --> 00:44:30.386
- Hey bro.

- Yeah.

957
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.016
- You cannot screw this up.

958
00:44:47.016 --> 00:44:48.512
okay?

959
00:44:48.512 --> 00:44:49.478
- Okay.

960
00:44:49.478 --> 00:44:50.554
- I need you to take all my stuff

961
00:44:50.554 --> 00:44:53.804
down to that safety
deposit box. all right?

962
00:44:53.804 --> 00:44:55.294
I need you to do that

963
00:44:55.294 --> 00:44:58.074
cause I don't want these
motherfuckers taking my shit.

964
00:44:58.074 --> 00:45:00.285

I need you to do that.

969
00:45:09.915 --> 00:45:12.414
- But you just said. if you go down.

970
00:45:12.414 --> 00:45:15.114
So you don't even know
what's about to happen.

971
00:45:15.114 --> 00:45:18.095
Why is they looking for you anyways?

972
00:45:18.095 --> 00:45:21.144
Do it got something to do with them girls?

973
00:45:21.144 --> 00:45:23.824
I mean they can't take you
to jail for that. can they?

974
00:45:23.824 --> 00:45:24.744
- That depends.

975
00:45:24.744 --> 00:45:26.374
- Depends on what bro.

976
00:45:26.374 --> 00:45:27.969

977
00:45:27.969 --> 00:45:30.474
I don't got time to talk
about this right now. okay?

978
00:45:30.474 --> 00:45:31.737
I'll explain it to you later.

979
00:45:31.737 --> 00:45:33.658
I just need you to handle that for me.

980
00:45:33.658 --> 00:45:34.491
How about this?

981
00:45:34.491 --> 00:45:36.327
How about we meet for
lunch and we talk about it.

982
00:45:36.327 --> 00:45:37.808
- Okay. so now we're
gonna meet at mom's house.

983
00:45:37.808 --> 00:45:38.641

991
00:45:57.129 --> 00:46:00.629
(camera shutter clicking)

992
00:46:02.468 --> 00:46:05.551
(car engine revving)

993
00:46:10.598 --> 00:46:12.758
- Sir exit the vehicle and sit right here.

994
00:46:12.758 --> 00:46:16.841
- Miss Milton. will you.
please exit the vehicle.

995
00:46:37.386 --> 00:46:40.386
- Yeah (indistinct)

996
00:46:44.994 --> 00:46:46.319
okay. I understand.

997
00:46:46.319 --> 00:46:47.152
yes.

998
00:46:47.152 --> 00:46:48.160
Okay. okay.

999
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.012
Yup.

1000
00:46:49.012 --> 00:46:50.095
I understand.

1001
00:46:51.253 --> 00:46:52.947
Yes. thank you.

1002
00:46:52.947 --> 00:46:54.017
Yup.

1003
00:46:54.017 --> 00:46:55.067
Thanks.

1004
00:46:55.067 --> 00:46:55.900
Good bye.

1005
00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:00.970
Got to work with all the
subjects are in custody.

1006
00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:03.311
so you maybe (indistinct).

1007
00:47:03.311 --> 00:47:06.313
However. US attorney has raised issue

1008
00:47:06.313 --> 00:47:11.313
with their detains based upon
the way they were executed.

1009
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.505
He's calling me with this
fucking bullshit like.

1010
00:47:13.505 --> 00:47:15.689
I'm the one who's responsible for putting

1011
00:47:15.689 --> 00:47:19.279
all the pressure on everyone here.

1012
00:47:19.279 --> 00:47:21.261
Excuse my language Agent Chan.

1013
00:47:21.261 --> 00:47:22.674
I just can't stand the audacity

1014
00:47:22.674 --> 00:47:24.133
of these assholes in Washington.

1015
00:47:24.133 --> 00:47:26.069
- I totally understand. sir.

1016
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:27.084
Don't even worry about it.

1017
00:47:27.084 --> 00:47:28.660
You know what?

1018
00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:30.031
I personally believe

1019
00:47:30.031 --> 00:47:31.528
that you should be the
one to go down there

1020
00:47:31.528 --> 00:47:32.841
and change that policy.

1021
00:47:32.841 --> 00:47:34.867
(laughing)

1022
00:47:34.867 --> 00:47:36.285
- Are you trying to humor me here.

1023
00:47:36.285 --> 00:47:37.118
- No.

1024
00:47:37.118 --> 00:47:38.749
- I'm comfortable with where I am.

1025
00:47:38.749 --> 00:47:39.911
Anyway. how did everything go

1026
00:47:39.911 --> 00:47:42.494
with search for the other girl?

1027
00:47:43.463 --> 00:47:44.296
- Oh. sir.

1028
00:47:44.296 --> 00:47:45.998
The information I obtained was outdated.

1029
00:47:45.998 --> 00:47:47.875
I spoke to a neighbor briefly

1030
00:47:47.875 --> 00:47:50.055
and he says that no
one's lived at that house

1031
00:47:50.055 --> 00:47:52.277
in over a year.

1032
00:47:52.277 --> 00:47:55.179
- Well I guess. but in the meantime.

1033
00:47:55.179 --> 00:47:57.443
see if you could give
us updated information.

1034
00:47:57.443 --> 00:47:58.861
- I'll do.

1035
00:47:58.861 --> 00:48:02.214
What time are we having that briefing.

1036
00:48:02.214 --> 00:48:05.168
- Ah. within the next
half hour. stay close by.

1037
00:48:05.168 --> 00:48:07.069
- Of course. well do.

1038
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:09.558
- But before I go. sir.

1039
00:48:09.558 --> 00:48:11.318
I have a question.

1040
00:48:11.318 --> 00:48:13.151
- What's it Agent Chan?

1041
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.349
- Do you think that it would be necessary

1042
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:21.266
for me to be the one to
interrogate this girls?

1043
00:48:23.736 --> 00:48:25.786
- You know. actually that
might not be a bad idea.

1044
00:48:25.786 --> 00:48:26.732
that's a good thing.

1045
00:48:26.732 --> 00:48:27.565
- All right.

1046
00:48:27.565 --> 00:48:28.545
- But of course. you know. the prosecutors

1047
00:48:28.545 --> 00:48:32.022
gonna wanna be present
during the interrogation.

1048
00:48:32.022 --> 00:48:33.688
They're much more valuable
to us as witnesses
then they are defendants.

1049
00:48:35.811 --> 00:48:37.439
- Absolutely sir.

1050
00:48:37.439 --> 00:48:40.356
Well. I'll see you at the briefing.

1051
00:48:41.879 --> 00:48:44.068
- You worrying too much.

1052
00:48:44.068 --> 00:48:45.485
I got this bitch.

1053
00:48:47.763 --> 00:48:49.710
- Listen pimp.

1054
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:53.056
I know you think you've
got yo hoe on lock in all

1055
00:48:53.056 --> 00:48:54.722
but I'm worried about them
hoes that just got grabbed.
all right?

1056
00:48:56.328 --> 00:48:57.161
I don't think none of
them bitches can stand up

1057
00:48:57.161 --> 00:48:57.994
under pressure.

1058
00:48:59.527 --> 00:49:01.092
We talking about the government Key.

1059
00:49:01.092 --> 00:49:03.185
- I understand all that.

1060
00:49:03.185 --> 00:49:05.086
but you already briefed
all of 'em anyway right?

1061
00:49:05.086 --> 00:49:07.966
- Nigga do a bear shit in the woods.

1062
00:49:07.966 --> 00:49:10.055
Of course I did dawg.

1063
00:49:10.055 --> 00:49:11.990
That shit don't mean nothing.

1064
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.823
Ain't none of these hoes

1065
00:49:12.823 --> 00:49:15.524
has been under that type
of microscope before blood.

1066
00:49:15.524 --> 00:49:17.707
plus. I don't think these
hoes love a nigga enough to go

1067
00:49:17.707 --> 00:49:19.796
to a can for a nigga.

1068
00:49:19.796 --> 00:49:21.213
- I feel you. but

1069
00:49:22.756 --> 00:49:25.346
just think of this like.

1070
00:49:25.346 --> 00:49:26.687
like. like a test.

1071
00:49:26.687 --> 00:49:27.537
- A test.

1072
00:49:27.537 --> 00:49:28.756
- Hear me out.

1073
00:49:28.756 --> 00:49:30.986
If these bitches stand up.

1074
00:49:30.986 --> 00:49:34.066
That means all that allegiance
they've been pledging.

1075
00:49:34.066 --> 00:49:35.720
that was true.

1076
00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.176
- So you wanna use this situation

1077
00:49:37.176 --> 00:49:39.776
as opportunity for your hoes.

1078
00:49:39.776 --> 00:49:42.466
to prove they selve to you right now?

1079
00:49:42.466 --> 00:49:43.299
- Yeah.

1080
00:49:44.255 --> 00:49:45.903
What better time than now T?

1081
00:49:45.903 --> 00:49:48.941
- Don't know if you fully understand.

1082
00:49:48.941 --> 00:49:53.029
Niggas is facing real
time right now. dawg.

1083
00:49:53.029 --> 00:49:55.731
The price is too high. playboy.

1084
00:49:55.731 --> 00:49:58.198
- Just wait this shit out. man.

1085
00:49:58.198 --> 00:49:59.885
- Let that bitch Kimmie work her magic.

1089
00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.525
♪ I don't got my motherfucking weight up ♪

1090
00:50:06.525 --> 00:50:08.608
♪ Weight up ♪

1091
00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:23.923
So agent.

1092
00:50:26.389 --> 00:50:30.339
just how long you've
been straddling the fence

1093
00:50:30.339 --> 00:50:32.389
- Straddling the fence?

1094
00:50:32.389 --> 00:50:34.420
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

1095
00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:35.819
- Oh. come on now.

1096
00:50:35.819 --> 00:50:38.849
You know exactly what
I'm talking about Chan.

1097
00:50:38.849 --> 00:50:41.475
I know you've been seeing that Watson guy

1098
00:50:41.475 --> 00:50:44.935
and you feeding him
information from the Bureau.

1099
00:50:44.935 --> 00:50:49.072
I know you've been sneaking
off having meetings with him.

1100
00:50:49.072 --> 00:50:51.096
I was there the other day when you two

1101
00:50:51.096 --> 00:50:53.726
went on your outing at
the corn beef place.

1102
00:50:53.726 --> 00:50:57.726
Remember. right after you
left the coffee house?

1103
00:50:58.875 --> 00:51:03.042
Should I remind you what
you had to eat for lunch?

1104
00:51:06.695 --> 00:51:11.028
I just don't understand.
why you stoop so low agent.

1105
00:51:11.913 --> 00:51:13.697
I mean. not all the
people to lose your life

1106
00:51:13.697 --> 00:51:16.947
and career over. you pick this scumbag.

1107
00:51:18.465 --> 00:51:20.075
Don't worry.

1108
00:51:20.075 --> 00:51:20.908
I ain't told a soul.

1109
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.250
I haven't told a soul.

1110
00:51:27.285 --> 00:51:30.535
So if I don't wanna see you go to jail.

1111
00:51:31.464 --> 00:51:32.342
what am I gonna do?

1112
00:51:32.342 --> 00:51:34.728
That's probably be what
you're thinking. right?

1113
00:51:34.728 --> 00:51:36.307
Cause on one hand.

1114
00:51:36.307 --> 00:51:39.919
I do think you should go
to jail with these animals.

1115
00:51:39.919 --> 00:51:42.233
And on the other hand.

1116
00:51:42.233 --> 00:51:43.891
I kind of feel some sense of shame

1117
00:51:43.891 --> 00:51:46.058
and concern for you agent.

1118
00:51:47.406 --> 00:51:49.994
Well. here's the deal agent.

1119
00:51:49.994 --> 00:51:51.911
Today's your lucky day.

1120
00:51:53.064 --> 00:51:55.973
you could do but two things for me

1121
00:51:55.973 --> 00:51:57.437
and I'll completely forget about it

1122
00:51:57.437 --> 00:52:00.197
and let you off the hook.

1123
00:52:00.197 --> 00:52:01.114
Two things.

1124
00:52:02.864 --> 00:52:04.031
50.000 in cash

1125
00:52:05.523 --> 00:52:09.422
and your resignation from the
Bureau by tomorrow morning.

1126
00:52:09.422 --> 00:52:10.675
Now I don't have to remind you

1127
00:52:10.675 --> 00:52:15.092
what will happen if you
don't meet my requests. do I?

1128
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:18.140
Undercover FBI agent.

1129
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:21.921
Indicted and brought up on charges

1130
00:52:21.921 --> 00:52:24.621
that she violated the
Bureau's Code of Ethics.

1131
00:52:24.621 --> 00:52:26.240
as well as had relationships

1132
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.856
and providing case information
to a suspected pimp

1133
00:52:29.856 --> 00:52:32.939
that she was assigned to investigate.

1134
00:52:35.422 --> 00:52:39.743
Now that's how that story
can look. front page news.

1135
00:52:39.743 --> 00:52:41.326
all across America.

1136
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:46.863
Now.

1137
00:52:47.928 --> 00:52:52.293
I'm sure you can get the
money from your new boyfriend

1138
00:52:52.293 --> 00:52:55.042
and be sure to tell them

1139
00:52:55.042 --> 00:52:57.670
I ain't got no problem

1140
00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:02.337
seeing both of you go to jail
for the rest of your life.

1141
00:53:03.531 --> 00:53:04.864
Good day. agent.

1142
00:53:06.564 --> 00:53:08.427
- Y'all can't afford this pussy anyway.

1143
00:53:08.427 --> 00:53:10.260
Oh God. you can't. nope.

1144
00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:13.186
On my mama you can't.

1145
00:53:13.186 --> 00:53:16.853
You can't even afford
my mamas pussy. nigga.

1146
00:53:30.135 --> 00:53:31.552
- Hello Crystal.

1147
00:53:33.966 --> 00:53:34.799
Cristal.

1148
00:53:38.201 --> 00:53:39.926
I'm sure you know by now that.

1149
00:53:39.926 --> 00:53:43.072
I work for the United States government

1150
00:53:43.072 --> 00:53:43.905
and your

1151
00:53:44.966 --> 00:53:47.466
name has come up on our radar.

1152
00:53:48.963 --> 00:53:50.723
You have any idea why?

1153
00:53:50.723 --> 00:53:52.490
- All I know is you need to
turn the fucking heat up.

1154
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:53.414
- Listen.

1155
00:53:53.414 --> 00:53:55.740
I don't think you realize

1156
00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:58.170
what kind of trouble you
and your friends are in.

1157
00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:02.253
And staying silent is not
gonna get you anywhere.

1158
00:54:03.515 --> 00:54:05.750
Except maybe on a plane to

1159
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:09.417
USP Penitentiary for
women in West Virginia.

1160
00:54:11.396 --> 00:54:14.696
Okay. Let's. let's cut
the bullshit here. okay?

1161
00:54:14.696 --> 00:54:16.613
You are in a lot of shit

1162
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:22.710
and you're gonna go away to
prison for a long time. okay?

1163
00:54:22.928 --> 00:54:24.928
Unless we work together.

1164
00:54:26.727 --> 00:54:28.894
So let's start with these.

1165
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:51.887
- Okay. you're showing me these why?

1166
00:54:51.887 --> 00:54:54.108
- Because there is other
incriminating evidence

1167
00:54:54.108 --> 00:54:55.941
that we have Crystal.

1168
00:54:57.184 --> 00:55:01.601
In fact. I brought a special
guest to the event here.

1169
00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:05.120
My ace in the hole

1170
00:55:08.219 --> 00:55:10.799
you do remember Kimmie?

1171
00:55:10.799 --> 00:55:12.951
Kimmie Crystal. Crystal Kimmy.

1172
00:55:12.951 --> 00:55:15.731
Although Kimmie's not
exactly who you think she is.

1173
00:55:15.731 --> 00:55:20.368
In fact Kimmie works as a
special agent for the FBI

1174
00:55:20.368 --> 00:55:23.790
and her job assignment was to bring you.

1175
00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:25.623
and your cronies down.

1176
00:55:29.058 --> 00:55:30.724
- You look really nice.
in a

1177
00:55:32.198 --> 00:55:34.281
little cop outfit Kimmie.

1178
00:55:35.376 --> 00:55:38.293
But it's not really my type of attire

1179
00:55:39.174 --> 00:55:40.091
- Crystal.

1180
00:55:41.632 --> 00:55:44.169
you're going away for a very long time.

1181
00:55:44.169 --> 00:55:46.507
if you don't cooperate with us.

1182
00:55:46.507 --> 00:55:48.925
you know that right?

1183
00:55:48.925 --> 00:55:51.104
- So what do you want me to do?

1184
00:55:51.104 --> 00:55:53.636
- They want you to tell
us everything you know

1185
00:55:53.636 --> 00:55:57.536
about Keyshawn and T.A
and their activities.

1186
00:55:57.536 --> 00:56:00.036
and then. you can go scott-free

1187
00:56:02.658 --> 00:56:05.200
All You have to do is testify

1188
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.700
in a secret trial.

1189
00:56:09.187 --> 00:56:12.559
And if you're called upon.
which you probably will not be.

1190
00:56:12.559 --> 00:56:14.974
you'll go to a jury.

1191
00:56:14.974 --> 00:56:19.974
And then you tell everybody
what you said today. simple.

1192
00:56:20.468 --> 00:56:22.226
- Unless I'm being charged with something

1193
00:56:22.226 --> 00:56:24.760
at this time I just want my lawyer.

1194
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.900
- You realize how many
people are out there.

1195
00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.483
just like yourself?

1196
00:56:30.851 --> 00:56:34.480
They're in a maximum. 25 years or up

1197
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.293
and you keep sticking your neck out here

1198
00:56:36.293 --> 00:56:38.293
for this guy. this bum.

1199
00:56:40.004 --> 00:56:41.203
- I understand what you're saying.

1200
00:56:41.203 --> 00:56:44.036
but like I said. I want my lawyer.

1201
00:57:00.728 --> 00:57:01.561
- Read that.

1202
00:57:17.201 --> 00:57:18.612
- You needed to see me sir

1203
00:57:18.612 --> 00:57:22.195
- Please come in and
close the door. agent.

1204
00:57:27.233 --> 00:57:28.249
I wanna start by saying that.

1205
00:57:28.249 --> 00:57:31.270
I've always thought that you
were a fine. brilliant agent.

1206
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:32.596
We have a problem.

1207
00:57:32.596 --> 00:57:36.272
It seems the only clue we
have leads right to you.

1208
00:57:36.272 --> 00:57:37.604
- Problem?

1209
00:57:37.604 --> 00:57:39.781
Sir what kind of problem?

1210
00:57:39.781 --> 00:57:41.555
- Several hundred hours of wiretap files

1211
00:57:41.555 --> 00:57:46.236
have been deleted from our
systems central hard drive.

1212
00:57:46.236 --> 00:57:48.617
Would you happen to know
anything about that?

1213
00:57:48.617 --> 00:57:51.200
(upbeat music)

1214
00:59:20.667 --> 00:59:21.667
- Gentleman.

1215
00:59:24.869 --> 00:59:26.387
What's really going on here?

1216
00:59:26.387 --> 00:59:27.327
- Your honor.

1217
00:59:27.327 --> 00:59:29.657
the government has been investing a case

1218
00:59:29.657 --> 00:59:32.807
against the men who are
entangled with these women.

1219
00:59:32.807 --> 00:59:37.807
And these men are violent
and manipulative to the core.

1220
00:59:37.867 --> 00:59:40.017
- Your honor. my clients. the women.

1221
00:59:40.017 --> 00:59:41.517
aren't a threat to society

1222
00:59:41.517 --> 00:59:44.129
and nor should they be
considered a flight risk.

1223
00:59:44.129 --> 00:59:45.987
What the prosecutor is attempting to do

1224
00:59:45.987 --> 00:59:47.817
by keeping these women in custody

1225
00:59:47.817 --> 00:59:50.757
without bail. is a scare tactic.

1226
00:59:50.757 --> 00:59:52.508
And if you ask me your honor.

1227
00:59:52.508 --> 00:59:54.107
an act of kidnapping.

1228
00:59:54.107 --> 00:59:54.940
- Right.

1229
00:59:56.567 --> 01:00:00.338
- The petitioners. shall
remain in custody without bail

1230
01:00:00.338 --> 01:00:03.087
until the proceeding of the
grand jury is completed.

1231
01:00:03.087 --> 01:00:04.337
- This is bullshit. your honor.

1232
01:00:04.337 --> 01:00:06.587
- That's enough Mr. Levitt.

1233
01:00:07.777 --> 01:00:10.417
Now's there anything else?

1234
01:00:10.417 --> 01:00:12.750
I have to get back to court.

1235
01:00:13.817 --> 01:00:14.734
- Let's go.

1236
01:00:18.473 --> 01:00:21.140
(phone ringing)

1237
01:00:23.965 --> 01:00:24.840
- Hello.

1238
01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.677
- Mrs. Watson.

Lake Shore Hospital.

1240
01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:32.047

1241
01:00:32.047 --> 01:00:33.580
- Is he okay?

1242
01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:37.170
- No ma'am I wish I had
good news. but I don't.

1243
01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:38.141
I'm sorry to tell you this.

1244
01:00:38.141 --> 01:00:39.802
but last night shortly after three.

1245
01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:42.739
(clock ticking)

1246
01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:45.739
(door bell ringing)

1247
01:00:57.535 --> 01:01:00.618
(bus engine revving)

1248
01:01:02.276 --> 01:01:03.665
- [U.S. Attorney] Please

1249
01:01:03.665 --> 01:01:05.845

- [U.S. Attorney] Can you

1252
01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:16.549

- I plead the fifth.

1254
01:01:20.729 --> 01:01:21.562
- [U.S. Attorney] Listen. can you please

1255
01:01:21.562 --> 01:01:22.395

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:32.452
- Every girl pleads the fifth.

1259

(gun shots roaring)

1260
01:01:37.901 --> 01:01:39.701
- I'm Natalie Westbrook.

1261
01:01:39.701 --> 01:01:41.051
They call me Natty.

1262
01:01:41.051 --> 01:01:43.641
and. oh. yeah. he's a pimp.

1263
01:01:43.641 --> 01:01:45.571
He beat me and others.

1264
01:01:45.571 --> 01:01:49.932
T.A used to beat us sometimes
until we passed out.

1265
01:01:49.932 --> 01:01:52.515
I left. and his hoes jumped me.

1266
01:01:58.041 --> 01:01:59.262
- Got the indictments.

1267
01:01:59.262 --> 01:02:00.513
- Good shit bro.

1268
01:02:00.513 --> 01:02:02.013
- You know it. whoaa.

1269
01:02:04.523 --> 01:02:07.773
- So what you think
about all this mess pimp?

1270
01:02:07.773 --> 01:02:09.553
- I don't know.

1271
01:02:09.553 --> 01:02:13.024
I ain't got all the details yet T.

1272
01:02:13.024 --> 01:02:14.006
I'm just trying to figure out.

1273
01:02:14.006 --> 01:02:17.000
what kinda charges are
they gone try to pin on us.

1274
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.019
But I'm gonna get a full
report from Kimmie tonight

1275
01:02:20.019 --> 01:02:23.352
- Yeah. man. it's just cold shit though.

1276
01:02:24.539 --> 01:02:26.996
- Trying to pin niggas for pimp.

1277
01:02:26.996 --> 01:02:28.985
- Well peep this.

1278
01:02:28.985 --> 01:02:31.232
you know. this country was
founded on illicit activities.

1279
01:02:31.232 --> 01:02:32.065
right?

1280
01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.816
After they established they land

1281
01:02:34.816 --> 01:02:36.149
which they stole

1282
01:02:37.115 --> 01:02:39.369
trying to put regulations on niggas. man.

1283
01:02:39.369 --> 01:02:42.836
Trying to prevent us from
making our mark in the world.

1284
01:02:42.836 --> 01:02:44.503
Straight pussy shit.

1285
01:02:45.449 --> 01:02:47.346
Shit it's yo turn pimp.

1286
01:02:47.346 --> 01:02:48.179
- I know.

1287
01:02:56.766 --> 01:02:59.183
(indistinct)

1288
01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:06.364
So what all did he say
about that Natty bitch?

1289
01:03:06.364 --> 01:03:07.568
- It was the DA dude.

1290
01:03:07.568 --> 01:03:08.857
he just asked if I knew who she was.

1291
01:03:08.857 --> 01:03:11.155
and when I said no. he knew I was lying.

1292
01:03:11.155 --> 01:03:13.292
I guess they had information
from sources confirming

1293
01:03:13.292 --> 01:03:15.357
that she was with you when we met.

1294
01:03:15.357 --> 01:03:16.279
- Sources. huh?

1295
01:03:16.279 --> 01:03:17.727
- Uh hum.

1296
01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:18.560
- I see.

1297
01:03:19.864 --> 01:03:20.985
I'm sure they didn't reveal

1298
01:03:20.985 --> 01:03:23.234
who those so-called sources was. huh?

1299
01:03:23.234 --> 01:03:26.383
That shit don't even surprise me.

1300
01:03:26.383 --> 01:03:28.562
Her testimony wasn't
even a deciding factor

1301
01:03:28.562 --> 01:03:30.258
in their indictment.

1302
01:03:30.258 --> 01:03:31.827
She really was just
another piece to the puzzle

1303
01:03:31.827 --> 01:03:33.000
that was going to get found

1304
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.148
with or without her funky ass.

1305
01:03:36.148 --> 01:03:37.839
- Daddy. I never liked that bitch.

1306
01:03:37.839 --> 01:03:39.817
That slut has done
nothing but cause trouble.

1307
01:03:39.817 --> 01:03:41.794
since I've been here.

1308
01:03:41.794 --> 01:03:43.096
we should have killed
that punk ass that day.

1309
01:03:43.096 --> 01:03:46.737
- Or kick her and throw her waste box out.

1310
01:03:46.737 --> 01:03:48.070
- I know. right.

1311
01:03:50.002 --> 01:03:53.733
(thunder rumbling)

1312
01:03:53.733 --> 01:03:55.900
- I'm here. where are you?

1313
01:03:58.532 --> 01:04:01.449
- I'll be right there Agent. relax.

1314
01:04:02.477 --> 01:04:03.310
- How long?

1315
01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:05.477
I thought you'd be prompt.

1316
01:04:07.401 --> 01:04:09.211
- I'll be right there.

1317
01:04:09.211 --> 01:04:12.128
(thunder rumbling)

1318
01:04:17.218 --> 01:04:18.551
- You know Chan.

1319
01:04:19.955 --> 01:04:21.123
I'm not at all surprised

1320
01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:24.147
that you actually showed up here today.

1321
01:04:24.147 --> 01:04:28.100
I mean you are kind of witty
when it came to reason.

1322
01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.714
But this thing with you and the pimp.

1323
01:04:30.714 --> 01:04:33.581
I mean. we got his
black ass in a sling. so

1324
01:04:33.581 --> 01:04:37.015
it's not like you. anybody else
could do anything about it.

1325
01:04:37.015 --> 01:04:38.026
- What do you want the?

1326
01:04:38.026 --> 01:04:40.769
Meritorious Achievement
Award or some shit?

1327
01:04:40.769 --> 01:04:43.708
- Okay. you grew a sense of humor.

1328
01:04:43.708 --> 01:04:45.558
which is cool.

1329
01:04:45.558 --> 01:04:46.884
But I hear being a single mom

1330
01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:49.384
is a bit of a pain in the ass.

1331
01:04:50.499 --> 01:04:52.561
- Yeah. well. I'm sure
it couldn't be any worse

1332
01:04:52.561 --> 01:04:56.231
than having no life after work. agent.

1333
01:04:56.231 --> 01:04:58.492
- Enough of the funny.

1334
01:04:58.492 --> 01:04:59.992
where's the money?

1335
01:05:04.922 --> 01:05:08.841
- Here's your money. but
before I give it to you.

1336
01:05:08.841 --> 01:05:12.122
I need your assurance. that
you will stick to your word

1337
01:05:12.122 --> 01:05:14.453
and you won't try any funny
business after all this.

1338
01:05:14.453 --> 01:05:17.352
- Me giving my word is all you got.

1339
01:05:17.352 --> 01:05:20.331
And I know that don't mean nothing to you.

1340
01:05:20.331 --> 01:05:23.664
However. I hold the remote to this show.

1341
01:05:25.083 --> 01:05:28.166
So therefore just sit back and watch.

1342
01:05:29.543 --> 01:05:31.960
Now give me my fucking money.

1343
01:05:36.245 --> 01:05:39.043
(thunder rumbling)

1344
01:05:39.043 --> 01:05:40.793
Now I bet it's all here

1345
01:05:41.733 --> 01:05:44.400
but just in the event that it ain't.

1346
01:05:47.241 --> 01:05:50.552
this lil meeting that we had here tonight.

1347
01:05:50.552 --> 01:05:52.941
will be null and void.

1348
01:05:52.941 --> 01:05:54.274
goodnight agent.

1349
01:05:57.247 --> 01:06:00.247
(gun shots roaring)

1350
01:06:05.404 --> 01:06:08.654
(foot steps pattering)

1351
01:06:10.234 --> 01:06:12.067
- Perfect time fellas.

1352
01:06:15.719 --> 01:06:17.302
- Toss the burner.

1353
01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:26.683
(door hinges squeaking)

1354
01:06:28.291 --> 01:06:30.871
- I was surprised you
gave me the time of day.

1355
01:06:30.871 --> 01:06:33.593
- Well. yeah. if you
play your cards right.

1356
01:06:33.593 --> 01:06:37.279
this could be good for the both of us.

1357
01:06:37.279 --> 01:06:39.766
So you said your name was Brett. right?

1358
01:06:39.766 --> 01:06:40.599
Yes Brett.

1359
01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:43.518
- Uh. and this is your place.

1360
01:06:43.518 --> 01:06:44.604
- Uh hum.

1361
01:06:44.604 --> 01:06:46.992
- Nice place you got here Brett

1362
01:06:46.992 --> 01:06:48.587
- Make yourself at home.

1363
01:06:48.587 --> 01:06:50.920
would you like some dessert?

1364
01:06:53.007 --> 01:06:55.246
- Umm yeah. you got a
rest room I can use first?

1365
01:06:55.246 --> 01:06:57.076
- Of course. second door on your right.

01:06:57.076 --> 01:06:58.877
- All right baby. I'll be right back.

1367
01:06:58.877 --> 01:07:02.210
(high-heels clattering)

1368
01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:10.608
(glass clinking)

1369
01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:25.211
- How's the drink baby?

1370
01:07:25.211 --> 01:07:27.128

01:07:48.742 --> 01:07:50.242
- Yeah. it's done.

1372
01:07:56.459 --> 01:07:57.292

1374
01:07:59.027 --> 01:08:01.456
- Toby. you know I don't like

- Okay. baby I love you.

1378
01:08:08.787 --> 01:08:10.954
Toby somebody's out there.

1379
01:08:14.013 --> 01:08:15.509
Oh my God. I hope they
not carrying in that bag

1380
01:08:15.509 --> 01:08:17.611
what I think they are.

1381
01:08:17.611 --> 01:08:18.528
- Be quite.

1382
01:08:20.259 --> 01:08:22.618
- Oh My God. Toby we gonna do something.

1383
01:08:22.618 --> 01:08:24.441
- Shut up. there's nothing we can do.

1384
01:08:24.441 --> 01:08:26.573
That person in that bag is already dead.

1385
01:08:26.573 --> 01:08:27.987
Just stay calm until they leave.

1386
01:08:27.987 --> 01:08:31.320
Otherwise. I know they gonna kill us.

1387
01:08:44.873 --> 01:08:46.573
- It's time to get the fuck out of here.

1388
01:08:46.573 --> 01:08:48.365
- And I'm calling the police.

1389
01:08:48.365 --> 01:08:49.198

Yeah. okay. what time
did you call the police?

1427
01:10:46.011 --> 01:10:49.344
- We called the police about like. 10:30.

1428
01:10:51.426 --> 01:10:53.719

condolence to his family.

- What happened?

1435
01:11:07.879 --> 01:11:09.091
- Well. that we're not too sure of.

1436
01:11:09.091 --> 01:11:10.583
The only thing we do know at this point

1437
01:11:10.583 --> 01:11:12.273
Is that he was taken by
a group of black males

1438
01:11:12.273 --> 01:11:15.884
in an unknown make and model black truck.

1439
01:11:15.884 --> 01:11:17.215
- That's odd.

1440
01:11:17.215 --> 01:11:18.209
- Tell me about it.

1441
01:11:18.209 --> 01:11:21.760
I'm leaving in a few minutes
to find out more firsthand.

1442
01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:22.889
We have two teens here now

1443
01:11:22.889 --> 01:11:24.258
that seemed to have witnessed it all.

1444
01:11:24.258 --> 01:11:25.744
And they claim to have
physical descriptions

1445
01:11:25.744 --> 01:11:27.193
of the suspects.

1446
01:11:27.193 --> 01:11:28.243
Just waiting on Washington

1447
01:11:28.243 --> 01:11:31.459
to give us the green light to
take over the investigation.

1448
01:11:31.459 --> 01:11:33.648
I'm sure by now that
hick police department

1449
01:11:33.648 --> 01:11:36.843
has screwed up the entire crime scene.

1450
01:11:36.843 --> 01:11:38.926
- Let's hope not. I just.

1451
01:11:40.105 --> 01:11:42.216
I can't believe this.

1452
01:11:42.216 --> 01:11:43.261
Not Daley.

1453
01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:44.107
- I don't know what kind of animal

1454
01:11:44.107 --> 01:11:46.048
would have done such a thing?

1455
01:11:46.048 --> 01:11:47.980
- What do you want me to do?

1456
01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:49.593
- Not to worry agent we're on it.

1457
01:11:49.593 --> 01:11:52.940
- Finish the things you
were already working on.

1458
01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:55.233
I hear the apprehension of
Watson and Smith went well.

1459
01:11:55.233 --> 01:11:56.324
That's good.

1460
01:11:56.324 --> 01:11:58.502
We can't let these bastards
get away with anything.

1461
01:11:58.502 --> 01:12:00.072
- Excuse me sir.

1462
01:12:00.072 --> 01:12:02.534
the conference room is
ready for the briefing.

1463
01:12:02.534 --> 01:12:03.367
- The briefing?

1464
01:12:03.367 --> 01:12:04.200
What briefing?

1465
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.033
- With the media.

1466
01:12:05.033 --> 01:12:07.699
- Oh. right.
Let's make this quick.

1467
01:12:35.084 --> 01:12:38.251
- Good looking woman you've got there.

1468
01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:42.165
Oh. I see.

1469
01:12:42.165 --> 01:12:44.096
You're a hard ass.

1470
01:12:44.096 --> 01:12:46.586
Well. what if I told you

1471
01:12:46.586 --> 01:12:48.178
that that pretty young
chick that you thought

1472
01:12:48.178 --> 01:12:51.761
was a hooker was actually
one of my agents.

1473
01:12:53.246 --> 01:12:56.096
- Then I'll tell you the same thing.

1474
01:12:56.096 --> 01:12:57.596
Talk to my lawyer.

1475
01:13:05.196 --> 01:13:09.779
- Damn I'm glad that bitch
pulled our coattail when she did

1476
01:13:11.734 --> 01:13:12.985
- Hello. Mr. Smith.

1477
01:13:12.985 --> 01:13:15.025
Special Agent In Charge Sydney Bender.

1478
01:13:15.025 --> 01:13:17.275
Mind if we talk for a few minutes?

1479
01:13:17.275 --> 01:13:19.685
- Man. talk about what homie?

1480
01:13:19.685 --> 01:13:21.695
- You guys are in a lot of trouble.

1481
01:13:21.695 --> 01:13:25.737
We have witnesses. wire
tabs. a whole list of things.

1482
01:13:25.737 --> 01:13:28.215
Basically. I have two
choices here. my man.

1483
01:13:28.215 --> 01:13:30.114
Can either tell us all that you know

1484
01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:34.455
or go away for the
remainder of your youth.

1485
01:13:34.455 --> 01:13:36.055
- Say man.

1486
01:13:36.055 --> 01:13:38.638
when do I get to see the judge?

1487
01:13:39.986 --> 01:13:41.913
- Last thing you need to
be worried about right now

1488
01:13:41.913 --> 01:13:44.163
is seeing a judge. brother.

1489
01:13:45.133 --> 01:13:46.413
What you need to focus on

1490
01:13:46.413 --> 01:13:49.223
is helping us and helping you

1491
01:13:49.223 --> 01:13:51.225
- Man. get outta here.

1492
01:13:51.225 --> 01:13:54.403
I ain't trying to hear that bullshit.

1493
01:13:54.403 --> 01:13:58.655
Y'all do what y'all gotta
do to me and my lawyers

1494
01:13:58.655 --> 01:14:01.004
yeah that's right motherfucker.

1495
01:14:01.004 --> 01:14:02.004
I said lawyers.

1496
01:14:05.333 --> 01:14:06.583
We'll do the same.

1497
01:14:08.284 --> 01:14:10.634
Now. if you don't mind.

1498
01:14:10.634 --> 01:14:13.217
I got some shit to think about.

1499
01:14:23.901 --> 01:14:25.700
(laughing)

1500
01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:29.131
(car engine revving)

1501
01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:32.964
- Go to the door with
the PO. cover him from .

1502
01:14:34.028 --> 01:14:35.828
Chan you didn't have to
come we have a cover.

1503
01:14:35.828 --> 01:14:38.240
- I know. I know but I owe it to Greg.

1504
01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.970
- Okay then. he's gonna go
to the door with the PO.

1505
01:14:41.970 --> 01:14:44.154
we won't move in until
he brandishes his weapon

1506
01:14:44.154 --> 01:14:46.237
and has a suspect at bay.

1507
01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.180
(door knocking)

1508
01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:58.202
- Damn. this slow motherfucker here. man.

1509
01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:00.035
Should have been here.

1510
01:15:09.377 --> 01:15:12.259
Knocking on the door. man.

Tiahmo Lewis you have
five minutes to come out .

1515
01:15:21.254 --> 01:15:22.704
- Y'all know I'm not going back in here.

1516
01:15:22.704 --> 01:15:23.537
- Come out with your hands up

1517
01:15:23.537 --> 01:15:24.370

1518
01:15:24.370 --> 01:15:25.767

01:15:25.767 --> 01:15:27.600
