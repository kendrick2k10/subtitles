00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.226
The committee!

3
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.990
Okay. good.

Listen. Lyota.

We have to support Mom.
We have to support her...

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.579
I'm the captain.
You're vice captain.

10
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.580
Come on. Lyota.

11
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.240
You're gonna be a regular. right?
That's what we're going for. too.

12
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.470
One on one.

13
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.060
Don't turn your back so easily.

14
00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:43.084
I'm reading the pitch myself.

15
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.019
You're gonna fuck me up.

16
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.150
You're very brave.

17
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.490
I do it all the time.
My heart is racing.

18
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.439
But I'm going to do my best
I'm gonna pretend like I'm okay.

19
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.940
After you're down. you're down.
Lyota!

20
00:03:40.964 --> 00:03:43.164
That's right. come at me!

21

Passer!
（Passer!)

22
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.620
Good job.

23
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.829
I'm fine.

24
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.830
Remember.

25
00:04:09.854 --> 00:04:11.854
Saw-chan! (Sota)

26
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.239
Let's do it again.

27
00:04:15.263 --> 00:04:16.763
Oh. you want to do it?

28
00:04:19.644 --> 00:04:21.644
Sorta!

29
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.209
Let's do 1-on-1!

30
00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:34.033
I had promised.

31
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.389
I'll do it. One more time!

32
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.959
See you tomorrow.

33
00:04:37.983 --> 00:04:39.983
Then take me with you.

34
00:04:40.007 --> 00:04:42.036
No. it's too early.

35
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.686
You're gonna have to work on your dribbling.
You're gonna take the regular. aren't you?

36
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.290
Yeah!

37
00:04:49.314 --> 00:04:52.614
You said we'd play one-on-one!
I told you!

38
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.620
I lied about one more time!
Liar. idiot sorta!

39
00:04:57.644 --> 00:05:00.644
Baka. asshole. otinko!

40
00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:03.668
Don't come back!

41
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.980
I'm off.

Staycation Wharf

46
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:45.986
To some president.
I'm gonna make him eat it.

47
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.010
Cut through the morning sun.

48
00:06:51.034 --> 00:06:57.034
You'll see it. you'll hear it
Love rocket.

49
00:06:57.058 --> 00:07:01.558
Something. someone.

50
00:07:01.582 --> 00:07:07.582
Not to protect.
I'm just trying to make it sound.

51
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:17.560
PAST TIME
NO WAY FUTURE

52
00:07:17.584 --> 00:07:23.584
LOVE ROCKETS!
LOVE ROCKETS!

53
00:07:23.608 --> 00:07:28.608
With Jerry's soul.

54
00:07:28.632 --> 00:07:34.632
LOVE ROCKETS!
LOVE ROCKETS!

55

If you eat it. it's the last thing you'll ever do
covered in love

56
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.200
Pass!

57
00:08:19.224 --> 00:08:22.224
You've been crunching from the get-go. huh?

58
00:08:28.248 --> 00:08:29.748
Hey!

59
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.820
Fly!
- Male!

60
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.429
What? Ryoo.

61
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.649
No. I didn't think you'd decide...

62
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.520
Same two points.

63
00:09:13.544 --> 00:09:15.544
Good. good. good!

64
00:09:16.568 --> 00:09:21.568
Good. good. good. Fukatsu!

65
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.279
Yabba! How many people came to support us?

66
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.109
What are you gonna say?
- Can you say it?

67
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.620
Compared to that...
We're a hodgepodge?

68
00:09:32.644 --> 00:09:36.144
Sister...
- Friends - Hostile Groups

69
00:09:36.168 --> 00:09:37.668
Aaan?

70
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.700
I knew it. I should've made us matching T-shirts.
We should have made matching T-shirts.

71
00:09:43.724 --> 00:09:47.724
No. Why not?
Why? Do you guys have the same one?

72
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.770
I'm just an amateur.
I mean. I'm not even sure if it's a good idea to have a flower arrangement.

73
00:09:53.794 --> 00:09:56.294
I'm sorry. my hair is red.
I'm sorry.

74
00:09:56.318 --> 00:09:57.618
Nice one

75
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.100
I know what it's like to be a parent.
- I know...

76
00:10:03.624 --> 00:10:06.624
What are you talking about?
You should be cheering for them!

77
00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:09.648
Michan!
(Mitsui Hisashi!)

78
00:10:18.972 --> 00:10:20.972
Woohoo!

79
00:10:25.996 --> 00:10:27.496
Oh!

80
00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.520
You're a cosmic imitator...

81
00:10:29.544 --> 00:10:33.544
Okey... But...
Mitsui is good today. Mr. King.

82
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.180
Oh. man...

83
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.650
All right!

84
00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:51.174
All right. defense!
I'm gonna stop one.

85
00:12:01.198 --> 00:12:03.198
Bastard...

86
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.920
You're the one who's gonna get aggravated first.
You're gonna get aggravated first.

87
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.560
Oh...

88
00:13:02.034 --> 00:13:04.034
The best in Japan?

89
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.080
a blow

90
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.530
Do it properly. Kora!
- What?

91
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.769
Mr. Champion's -

92
00:13:45.793 --> 00:13:49.293
This is the best guard in Japan.

93
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.219
Guards all over Japan
The hearts and minds of the people

94
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.010
Do it!

95
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.229
I'll keep you company for 40 minutes.

96
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.950
You son of a bitch!

97
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.240
Come back. Come back!

98
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.259
Bon appétit!

99
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.459
Come on. come on. come on. come on.
There's no room here.

100
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.729
Thank you.

101
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.770
I'm glad you're here.
We've been waiting for you.

102
00:14:39.094 --> 00:14:41.094
Oh?

103
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.640
Yay! Ryosuke!

104
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.140
Nice going through!

105
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.720
More than usual.
You're looking sharp. Ryo-chan.

106
00:15:10.144 --> 00:15:12.644
Maybe it's because Mom's here.

107
00:15:13.944 --> 00:15:15.944
Go!

108
00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.549
Well. it's small.

109
00:15:18.573 --> 00:15:20.026
Nice work. number seven.
You're so small.

110
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.639
That's her. Look.

111
00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.440
He passed away some years ago.
Brother of Sota Miyagi

112
00:15:26.464 --> 00:15:29.464
Yeah. I was wearing the same number 7...

113
00:15:29.488 --> 00:15:32.488
She was so easy.
It was easy.

114
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.169
You're dead.
- It was an accident at sea.

115
00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.260
It's different!

116
00:15:40.284 --> 00:15:43.784
Sou-chan lives alone on a faraway island.
You're living alone on a faraway island.

117
00:15:43.808 --> 00:15:46.808
Anna! Anna!
Sorry.

118
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.500
Aiyah...

119
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.269
Second half begins.

120
00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.240
No. 7 (Small FW)
No. 15 No. 6

121
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.819
Good luck!

122
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.379
I've been in a fight with your brother.
I've played with your brother before.

123
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.639
And then my brother...
I got beat to a pulp by my brother.

124
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.740
What's the big deal about my brother?

125
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.640
Good luck!

126
00:16:36.764 --> 00:16:39.364
Lyota!

127
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.380
I'll take care of it!

128
00:16:50.404 --> 00:16:53.404
Ryo-chan!
- Good luck!

129
00:16:53.428 --> 00:16:55.428
Ryo-chan. hang in there!

130
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.020
Ah!

131
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:14.029
Oh no. no.

132
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.309
You're not like your brother.

133
00:17:17.333 --> 00:17:19.986
You can't replace your brother.

134
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.939
Oh. God.
I'm trying to clean up.

135
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.440
This house could be anywhere.
I'm moving.

136
00:19:33.664 --> 00:19:37.664
Just because we're siblings doesn't mean we have to have the same number.
Just because we're brothers doesn't mean we have to have the same number.

137
00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.410
（Let's have him replace me.

138
00:19:47.734 --> 00:19:51.234
I like number 7...
(Ace. FW)

139
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.680
What are you doing...!

140
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.090
Don't come in here!

141
00:20:10.114 --> 00:20:14.114
Take off your clothes!
You have your own!

142
00:20:15.138 --> 00:20:17.138
Stop it! Stop it!

143
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:33.020
I can't take your place.
I can't replace you.

144
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.960
Second half begins.

145
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.520
Here comes another.
Here comes the match...

146
00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.940
Number 7. I'll hit it!
- Okay.

147
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.469

149
00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:48.010
Miyagi. pass. Let me out!
- Where the hell are you?

150
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.840
Oh...

151
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.030
Ah!

152
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.540
Hey!

153
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.760
I got it.
- This is tough.

154
00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.529
What is it?

155
00:22:28.553 --> 00:22:31.180
What the hell are you doing?
Come to me quickly!

156
00:22:31.181 --> 00:22:32.680
（Two defenses on Lyota.)

157
00:22:32.704 --> 00:22:34.404
Don't be lickety-split!

158
00:22:34.428 --> 00:22:37.028
Offense Charging

159
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.820
Okay. then. to all of you.
Introduce yourself.

160
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.949
I am Lyota Miyagi

161
00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.389
Starting today...
I'm going to study...

162
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.769
（You're a skank. (Sigh...)

163
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:08.090
I just moved here from Okinawa.
I know there are a lot of things I don't understand.

164
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.970
Don't get carried away!

165
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.090
Lyota!

166
00:23:55.114 --> 00:23:58.114
You can't play with a ball.
Go play ball somewhere else!

167
00:24:07.138 --> 00:24:09.138
Shut up!

168
00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:28.779
Can he come in?

169
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.500
Oh... Something.
It's something else.

170
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.320
Elementary school student?
(Hisashi Mitsui)

171
00:24:52.344 --> 00:24:54.344
I'm in the first grade.

172
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.299
It's not just about showing you how to do it.

173
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.630
Apply pressure!

174
00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.039
You're not going to give up now?

175
00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.939
If you're doing this all by yourself...

176
00:25:49.963 --> 00:25:52.263
You're wasting your digs (steps).
What a waste!

177
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.800
Shut up!

178
00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:13.050
Hey. man! What are you doing?

179
00:26:13.074 --> 00:26:15.574
I ain't touched the ball yet!

180
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:21.889
Twenty minutes is the limit?
It's your first appearance. Mr. Shohoku.

181
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.459
That would break my heart.

182
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.359
You have 5 seconds!
- Quickly!

183
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.940
Ten seconds. Fly fast!

184
00:26:33.964 --> 00:26:35.964
Bad path!

185
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.350
Ryukawa. you do it!
Carry it to the three!

186
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.540
Out One Throw

187
00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:16.980
Timeout Red!

188
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.090
Yo. dick!

189
00:27:23.114 --> 00:27:25.614
I haven't touched the ball yet.
I ain't touched the ball yet!

190
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.060
30 seconds. Let's breathe.

191
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:45.459
If I were the King of the Mountain. I'd still
I would still go with a zone press.

192
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.560
Ripped or--

193
00:27:47.584 --> 00:27:50.584
Until the other party's heart
Until they are completely broken...

194
00:27:58.004 --> 00:28:00.504
Now is the time to strike.
- Yes. sir!

195
00:28:03.028 --> 00:28:05.028
No breakage...

196
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:14.609
Mr. Mitsui. Mr. Nagaregawa.
Let's run forward. too!

197
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.110
Mr. Miyagi.
- Yes. sir.

198
00:28:17.534 --> 00:28:20.534
This is your stage.

199
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:29.359
What about me? Dad.

200
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.360
What about this genius. Sakuragi?

201
00:28:31.384 --> 00:28:34.884
You're gonna make a dash for the ring.
You're gonna make a dash for the ring.

202
00:28:34.908 --> 00:28:36.908
All right!

203
00:28:36.932 --> 00:28:39.932
Lyota! Give me your hand.

204
00:28:39.956 --> 00:28:41.816
Red Hurry up!

205
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.440
Yeah. what?

206
00:28:43.464 --> 00:28:45.964
(NO.1 guard! )

207
00:28:47.664 --> 00:28:51.664
Like you always do.
Go ahead and act like you're the big man.

208
00:29:00.688 --> 00:29:04.688
Not that again...
- Stop it!

209
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.770
Let's go!

210
00:29:07.794 --> 00:29:09.794
Sawakita (Sanno Kouko)
Give me the ball!

211
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.880
Damn!

212
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.510
Fast...

213
00:29:20.534 --> 00:29:22.534
I'm No. 1 when it comes to digs!

214
00:29:22.558 --> 00:29:24.558
Move!

215
00:29:27.982 --> 00:29:29.982
Sakuragi!

216
00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.560
Nagarekawa...

217
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.490
Mr. Ball...

218
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.580
Let's take it one by one!

219
00:29:45.604 --> 00:29:47.604
Kawada...

220
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:09.510
Come on. one!
No. there's no angle.

221
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.330
Can I beat this guy?
Can I win?

222
00:30:37.354 --> 00:30:39.354
Good. good. good. Kawada!

223
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.780
Do it back. Akagi!
- One!

224
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.790
I know that pattern of attack.
I know.

225
00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.139
And that pattern...

226
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.890
Kawada...

227
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.030
By 20 points!

228
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.940
Look at this. It's amazing!
(In game)

229
00:31:38.064 --> 00:31:40.064
(Okay! )

230
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.300
One more.
Let's take one more!

231
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:05.739
（Mikio Kawada
I knew that the first half of the

232
00:32:05.763 --> 00:32:08.763
Your defense.
It's working.

233
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.880
Like a body blow.

234
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.880
Poor probability of 3-point P

235
00:32:25.904 --> 00:32:28.904
He sees Lyota's weakness.
I see it...

236
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.195
In this case. the ultimate weapon.
The only way is to explode!

237
00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:37.519
It's a match. Paul (Nobe)!
- The ultimate weapon?

238
00:32:40.243 --> 00:32:42.543
Sakuragi...
- Huh!

239
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:47.290
Double dribble!
(Ball held up on the way)

You better start fucking around. you motherfucker!
I'll kill you!

242
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.120
Shut up. you son of a bitch!
Shut the fuck up!

243
00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:08.039
Eight minutes without a goal?

244
00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.819
Anyway. I gotta get one...

245
00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:22.220
This guy...

246
00:33:23.544 --> 00:33:25.544
I can't find anything...

247
00:33:25.568 --> 00:33:27.568
Ryukawa: Give it to me!

248
00:33:28.592 --> 00:33:30.392
Danna. please!

249
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.470
We can't lose.
We can't lose.

250
00:33:37.494 --> 00:33:39.494

We've come this far because...
We've come this far because--

253
00:33:52.793 --> 00:33:54.793
Because they are strong under the goal...

254
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.709
Because Danna fights for us.
All around us live

255
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.380
No...

256
00:34:09.743 --> 00:34:11.596
Let's speak up!

257
00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.029
Ahhhh! Idiot!

258

Don't you talk?

260
00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.856
Don't play quietly!
Speak up!

261
00:34:26.655 --> 00:34:28.655
Next!

262
00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.410
I'm not that type.
I'm not that type. I'm...

263
00:34:31.434 --> 00:34:32.734
Miyagi!

264
00:34:32.758 --> 00:34:34.058
Hey. Hey. Hey.

265
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:47.839
All dressed up like that.
Did you have to make that pass. now?

266
00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.440
Your play is chalai!

267
00:34:50.464 --> 00:34:51.964
Huh?

268
00:34:51.988 --> 00:34:53.988
Shut up...

269
00:34:54.012 --> 00:34:56.612
Just listen and let it go.

270
00:34:56.615 --> 00:34:58.615
You'll get used to it.

271
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.960
And that pass is faster.

272
00:35:04.784 --> 00:35:07.284
The defense.
I can't handle it. and...

273
00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:13.509
No. I didn't think that they would be able to react either.
I didn't think they could react either.

274
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.486
What?

275
00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.510
It doesn't fit...
I really don't get it.

276
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.529
Because I'm counting on it.

277
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.799
Mr. Akagi. more than anyone.
He knows about Lyota...

278
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.629
I'm sorry

279
00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:34.350
Aaan?

280
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.279
You're so small.

281
00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.859
Who's expecting me?
This little guy?

282
00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.360
I thought basketball was all about height.
Isn't it important?

283
00:36:04.384 --> 00:36:05.884
Huh?

284
00:36:05.908 --> 00:36:07.408
Come on. Lyota...

285
00:36:07.432 --> 00:36:09.132
Hey. Longhair!
- Don't!

286
00:36:09.156 --> 00:36:11.156
Huh?

287
00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.680
I'll do 1-on-1 anytime!

288
00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.710
In exchange. you...
If you lose. you get a shaved head!

289
00:36:17.734 --> 00:36:19.734
Huh? Wait. hey!

290
00:36:19.758 --> 00:36:21.758
Wait. Cora!

291

Ah!

Why don't you put in the pass?

Locker after retirement match for third-year students

303

I'm the only one who did my best.
It's coming out.

304
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.409
Ahhhh!
It's over!

305
00:37:58.513 --> 00:37:59.766
Now retired!

306
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.710
Our generation (three years) has left.
Now it's time for us to go...

307
00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:06.714
A dictatorship of terror.
It's about to begin!

308
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:13.900
Poor baby... Well...
Good luck the rest of the year. guys.

309
00:38:14.924 --> 00:38:19.624
You're not gonna last the summer.
Troubled boy...

Huh?
- Huh?

311

It's your eyes.
Are you fucking kidding me?

312
00:38:26.124 --> 00:38:31.124
A stiff and a troublemaker.
There's no way they'll get along.

313

(Present form: Sanno Kogyo Battle)

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:51.190
You're thinking too much.
You want me to move my feet a little more?

316
00:38:53.814 --> 00:38:57.314
Mr. Kogure.
Mr. Sakuragi will take your place.

317
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.500
Yes. we're on.
Red. Pick up!

318
00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:09.330
My father...
You're lowering this genius...

319
00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:13.890
You gave up.
Glasses. you're retired.

320
00:39:13.895 --> 00:39:15.895
The last thing they want to do is let you out...

- Oh. Aiwa Gakuen.

322
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:26.229
Am I the only one?
The only one who still thinks he can win.

323
00:39:26.253 --> 00:39:28.806
I thought you gave up.
Dad.

324
00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.830
Give up?

325
00:39:31.854 --> 00:39:36.554
If you give up...
That's where the game ends.

Here it is!

332
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.370
If you got the rebound.
What would you do?

333
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.409
Sanno. not self-doubt.

334
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:25.919
First of all. there will be no more quick attacks from Sanno's rebounds.
From the rebound of the Sanno.

335
00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:31.419
And Shohoku will have one more chance.
One more shooting chance for Shohoku

336
00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.859
So instead of two (-) points. we have

337
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.860
Plus two points
Opportunities arise.

338
00:40:38.884 --> 00:40:42.384
Do you understand? Mr. Sakuragi.

339
00:40:42.408 --> 00:40:45.908
You mean it works for 4 points?

340
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:53.810
If you can do that. you
You'll be the trump card to catch up.

That's what you mere mortals seem to think.

All right? I'm just an ordinary guy.

345
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:23.130
You'll get the rebound just in case.

346
00:41:26.154 --> 00:41:27.654
Are we there yet? Hey. Dad.

347
00:41:27.678 --> 00:41:31.678
I'm not in yet. am I?
I'm telling you. man.

348
00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:33.920
Get me out of here!

350
00:41:52.583 --> 00:41:55.239
With this point difference. you're going to take out Sakuragi?

351
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.719

No three points...

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.399

353
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.540
spectacle

354
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:16.559
Hanamichi. we've been waiting for you!
Problem child!

355
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.079
I'm catching up. amateurs.

356
00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.659
"If you give up--

357
00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:28.990
That's where the game ends."
I'm sorry...

358
00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:42.429
What is it at a time like this?

359
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:46.080
Uhhh...

360
00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.909
(What?)

361
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:05.679
What is it? You.

362
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.880
What are you doing?
Get off!

363
00:43:07.904 --> 00:43:09.904
That idiot!

364
00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:19.700
I will defeat Yamao!
by Genius Sakuragi

365
00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.740
(Pull back! Get out!)

366
00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.140
Bastards!

367
00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:39.839
I'm sorry. That guy--

368
00:43:39.842 --> 00:43:42.142
I've only been playing basketball
I've only been playing basketball for four months...

369
00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.819
If you do it again. you're out.

370
00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.420
What do you think? Guys.

371
00:43:50.444 --> 00:43:52.444
Oh?

372
00:43:55.044 --> 00:43:58.044
Now we have no choice but to win.

373
00:43:58.068 --> 00:44:00.068
Oh!

374
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:02.499
What's with that face. Gori?

375
00:44:02.823 --> 00:44:04.629
You don't think you can win anymore?
You think you can't win anymore?

376
00:44:05.053 --> 00:44:06.306
What?

377
00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:08.939
You make it sound so easy.
It's not that easy.

378
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.209
Oh? Idiot!

379
00:44:10.233 --> 00:44:14.233
You and your basketball-heads.
Common sense doesn't work for me.

380
00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:18.200
Because he's an amateur.

381
00:44:18.224 --> 00:44:20.224
Huff!

382
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.549
Let's go. boys!

383
00:44:26.552 --> 00:44:29.152
I'm gonna die trying.
Follow me. genius!

384
00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:31.339
(Exit!)

385
00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.690
Oh? I can't hear you!

386
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.600
Oh. Them! To victory.
Won't you cheer for me?

387
00:44:38.724 --> 00:44:40.724
I've got a bunch of pissed off customers.
Don't lose!

388
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.990
To win...? Or is it?

389
00:44:45.414 --> 00:44:47.414
Ha! (Laughs)

390
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:57.389
That idiot... He hit me before I could think straight.
He hit me before I could think straight!

391
00:44:57.413 --> 00:44:58.913
All right!

392
00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.670
Oh. good!

393
00:45:12.694 --> 00:45:14.694
That son of a bitch!

394
00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:27.569
The score in the second half was
26 to 2.

395
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:30.389
But the time difference is not that big!

396
00:45:30.413 --> 00:45:32.813
I'm sure the tide will turn again.

397
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:37.890
If you're 10 points ahead. you're still in with a chance.
you still have a chance.

398
00:45:39.314 --> 00:45:41.914
Akagi Help!

399
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:46.429
Okay. Lyota!

400
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:48.306
Hang on!

401
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:51.680
The flow is ours.
We bring the flow ourselves. you know!

402
00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.540
Enter!

403
00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.390
Ugh! Same hand!

404
00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:16.099
I did it!
- Sakuragi... - Hanamichi!

405
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.289
Ha ha! You see!

406
00:46:19.313 --> 00:46:21.913
That's great...
Just as instructed. that boy!

407
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:26.119
Well. these two...
It's like I was allowed to take them.

408
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.259
And the purpose of introducing cherry blossoms--

409
00:46:29.283 --> 00:46:32.283
But it is not only about rebounding
but not only

410
00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.760
Let's start with the point differential.
We're going to get to the 10-point mark!

411
00:46:34.784 --> 00:46:36.784
Oh. yeah!

412
00:46:36.808 --> 00:46:38.808
Ike Ose Ose Shohoku!
Ose Ose Shohoku!

413
00:46:38.832 --> 00:46:41.432
Ike Ose Ose Shohoku!
Ose Ose Shohoku!

414
00:46:41.456 --> 00:46:43.456
Ike Ike Shohoku!

415
00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:48.740
Damn!

416
00:46:48.764 --> 00:46:50.764
Danna. you stop the ball too much!

417
00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:55.909
Ah! I can't do that.
I can't go in there!

418
00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:03.759
High price!

419
00:47:03.783 --> 00:47:07.589
No. it's more like...
Faster!

420
00:47:07.613 --> 00:47:09.613
Why?

421
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:15.469
Red boy. you will do it. won't you?

422
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:17.330
Pass it out. Hanamichi!

423
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:27.770
National Conquest...

424
00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:32.340
Woohoo!

425
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.459
Ah!

426
00:47:35.483 --> 00:47:37.483
Aaah!

427
00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.860
Offense Charging!

428
00:47:48.884 --> 00:47:52.884
"Hitori! de de
Potto! de de"

429
00:47:52.908 --> 00:47:54.908
Alone!"

430
00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:00.119
"Ate ate ate ate ate!
Oops!"

431
00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:09.299
"Just let me fall down like this!"

432
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:14.589
"I don't blame anyone.
You did a good job."

433
00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:19.890
"It's impossible to begin with!
It's impossible anyway!"

434
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:28.040
"Do you think you're the only one
Do you think you're the only one?"

435
00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.140
"Don't push it."

436
00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.200
"I've always dreamed of winning the national championship.
It's so annoying..."

437
00:48:37.224 --> 00:48:41.224
"I wanted to ask you.
Akagi..."

438
00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:45.220
"What's it like to look down from above?
What's it like?"

439
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.740
"What do you think we are?"

440
00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.169
Are you okay? You want a shift?

441
00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:38.579
I'm fine.

442
00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:44.420
Oh. well. I've already done what I wished.
I already got my wish.

443
00:49:46.444 --> 00:49:49.444
Oh!

444
00:49:49.468 --> 00:49:50.668
Where is it?

445
00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:56.009
Haha! It's getting a little gory.
It's getting gory. finally!

446
00:49:56.010 --> 00:50:00.410
Kawada is Kawada. I'm me.

447
00:50:00.434 --> 00:50:03.434
Akagi is Akagi... I'm...

448
00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:14.600
Red Ball!

449
00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.340
One!

450
00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:35.064
Come on!

451
00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.749
I think he's reached the end of his rope.

452
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:44.300
Kawata is Kawata. Akagi is Akagi

453
00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.400
And I'm... Who am I?

454
00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.840
Say my name.

455
00:50:54.864 --> 00:50:56.864
Who am I?

456
00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:04.380
Hey. kid!

457
00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.570
A bad comic book?

458
00:51:15.594 --> 00:51:18.094
Really. this kind of thing...

459
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:38.579
I don't like your twisted eyebrows.
I don't like your eyebrows.

460
00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.339
I don't like the way you've got your hair.
I don't like your long hair.

461
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:52.440
Say my name!

462
00:51:55.664 --> 00:51:57.664
Mitsui!

463
00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.380
Who am I?

464
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:19.740
Yay!
The score difference is 10 points!

465
00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.480
Hey. Miyagi! Use me!

466
00:52:27.204 --> 00:52:29.204
Use...

467
00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:37.090
No. the screen (wall) goes out...

468
00:52:37.114 --> 00:52:39.114
I'll be open.

469
00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.880
If you take threesomes away from me.
I'll have nothing left.

470
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:05.270
Nice! Mitsui!

471
00:53:06.294 --> 00:53:10.294
I can only see the ring
（I can only see the net.

472
00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.280
（Miyagi and Mitsui in the past)

473
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:21.870
Come on now! Offense first.
From the defense!

474
00:53:21.894 --> 00:53:23.894
You're on defense now. right?

475
00:53:23.918 --> 00:53:26.918
Why? No matter how you look at it.
I'm screwed up.

476
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:31.670
Never mind. Matsumoto!
Let me hit it. Let me hit it!

477
00:53:33.694 --> 00:53:35.694
Reluctant. but...

478
00:53:35.718 --> 00:53:39.018
From a 3-pointer all the way.
It's rather easy to protect them.

479
00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:49.300
You've got to make sure it falls out.
Just make sure you pick it up.

480
00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:51.440
Are you coming?

481
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:53.170
I can't get in there!

482
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:22.590
Hey. you!
What's going on? Hey. hey. hey. hey!

483
00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.340
Oh! This is where it starts!

484
00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.979
Don't get carried away. you know!

485
00:54:59.003 --> 00:55:01.003
(Knee injury)

486
00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.870
What...

487
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:45.959
Looks like garbage...

488
00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:52.020
If my heart was racing...

489
00:55:53.044 --> 00:55:55.744
What's wrong?
Ryo-chan!

490
00:55:55.768 --> 00:56:00.568
What happened?
(puts away shoes)

491
00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:01.950
Damn!

492
00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:16.840
Damn!

493
00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:21.640
Damn!

494
00:56:25.164 --> 00:56:26.364
Damn!

495
00:56:26.988 --> 00:56:29.988
（My brother sorta didn't come back.)
- Damn!

496
00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.620
（Motorcycle accident)

497
00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:57.090
Ryo-chan...

498
00:56:59.514 --> 00:57:00.714
Ryo-chan...

499
00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:04.519
Mom.
Ryoo. I'm up.

500
00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:06.790
Ryoo. are you okay?
Do you understand?

501
00:57:06.814 --> 00:57:08.814
It's a hospital. This is it.

502
00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.880
Hospital...

503
00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.859
Motorcycle.
He said it was a mess.

504
00:57:15.883 --> 00:57:19.883
Oh. the bike...

505
00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.629
I see Okinawa!

506
00:57:24.953 --> 00:57:26.253
Huh?

507
00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:29.690
What are you thinking? You!

508
00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:42.879
The doctor said.

509
00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:48.080
He said he was lucky.

510
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:15.300
Why don't we run a little slower?

511
00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:19.110
What are you talking about?
A former All-Japan player...

512
00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:57.990
You must be Ryo-chan.
When did you get here?

513
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Grow up!

514
00:59:00.024 --> 00:59:02.024
How are you?

515
00:59:02.048 --> 00:59:04.048
Grandma. who is it?

516
00:59:05.072 --> 00:59:07.072
Who is it?

517
00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:14.460
Thor. that's great!

518
00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:58.170
Ouch!
(Sorta's secret base)

519
01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:08.159
Is that a pro?

520
01:01:08.183 --> 01:01:10.683
No. High school student.

521
01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.939
Achieved three consecutive Inter-High School championships

522
01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.069
Strongest. Sanno (Industry).

523
01:01:23.170 --> 01:01:26.460
Thor. you want to go in there?

524
01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:42.569
Well. I'm gonna go this way anyway.
(opponent). right?

525
01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:48.570
First year of middle school. second year of middle school. third year of middle school. first year of high school.
Four years?

526
01:01:49.594 --> 01:01:53.594
Okinawa Representative Ace
Sota Miyagi!

527
01:01:53.618 --> 01:01:56.118
There you go!

528
01:01:56.130 --> 01:02:01.169
Oh. look out!
Double clutchー! (SHOOTING)

529
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:09.390
It's decided!
The strongest king of the mountain. defeated!

530
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.640
(Silent recollection)

531
01:02:34.664 --> 01:02:36.664
（Don't forget... )

532
01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.239
Thor...

533
01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:47.039
I'm sorry. I don't know why. I...

534
01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:51.289
I'm just trying to piss off my mom.
She's always pissed me off.

535
01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:54.630
If only Thor were here...

536
01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.840
(Put the shoes back on.)

537
01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.740
Good. Go!

538
01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:01.850
Intention (Intentional Interference)
White 4 (Fukatsu)

539
01:05:01.874 --> 01:05:03.874
Intention?
- Intention?

540
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:08.490
Good!
- Nice foul.

541
01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:18.829
What's with your head?
（Mitsui. I'll cut off your long hair.)

542
01:05:18.830 --> 01:05:21.949
You're not going back to the basketball team?
Are you going back to the basketball team?

543
01:05:21.973 --> 01:05:23.973
Shut up!

544
01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:26.070
I'm not a quitter.

545
01:05:28.494 --> 01:05:30.494
What?

546
01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:40.190
Seriously...

547
01:05:49.514 --> 01:05:51.114
Here's the point!

548
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:52.919
If we take this chance. we'll be able to--

549
01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.449
My family still survives.

550
01:05:54.454 --> 01:05:56.754
Otherwise. you're the King of the Mountain.
Otherwise. Sanno has no right to win!

551
01:05:56.778 --> 01:05:59.778
All right. let's make it a 10-point game!
- Oh!

552
01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:04.650
I'm getting into a good rhythm.
It's getting into a good rhythm.

553
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:39.850
The best guard in Japan
Fukatsu and I...

554
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:51.100
I'll match up.
(One-on-one)?

555
01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:05.569
I'm the one.
He says I'm the cut-throat.

556
01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:10.359
I've been--

557
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.690
All you do is butt out.

558
01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:24.229
Where?

559
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:27.230
You're so...
You're so quick to fight. aren't you?

560
01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:34.840
Fukatsu has been a freshman
He's been a starter for Sanno...

561
01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:38.899
That guy and me...
You're gonna match me up with this guy?

562
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.500
That's a perfect fit. Captain Cutting Edge.

563
01:07:46.924 --> 01:07:48.924
My heart is racing.

564
01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.480
No. I didn't know.

565
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:57.770
You always look like you've got room to spare.

566
01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:05.640
You. too.
I'm a pretty good guard.

567
01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:10.229
Not the best in Kanagawa. but...

568
01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:13.969
NO.2 Not really. but...

569
01:08:13.993 --> 01:08:15.693
Well...

570
01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:17.946
No. that's enough!

571
01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:21.470
When things get tough.
Should I decide to do something?

572
01:08:21.494 --> 01:08:24.494
Anything. Yeah...

573
01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:32.670
For example...
Look at the palm of your hand...

574
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.840
NO.1 Guard

575
01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:50.039
Miyagi. you're...

576
01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:54.450
You've been out full time.
You must be pretty worn out.

577
01:08:59.530 --> 01:09:03.230
Ryotin. make up your mind.
Be careful with that.

578
01:09:03.232 --> 01:09:05.232
Hit it hard!
Don't miss!

579
01:09:05.235 --> 01:09:06.835
Shut up. it's distracting!

580
01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:17.690
Yay!

581
01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.770
He'll be fine.

582
01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:48.400
All right!
- Shah!

583
01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:56.050
Yeah...

584
01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.940
10 points difference!

585
01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:11.770
All right! Kawada!

586
01:10:13.794 --> 01:10:16.294
（It's Mark's turn.)

587
01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.680
（I'm on you.)

588
01:10:27.704 --> 01:10:31.204
Kawada's got that red boy.
He's marking him!

589
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:34.539
Kawada... I've never done anything like this before.
Rebounding.

590
01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:36.716
Let me take it.
The guy I couldn't get...

591
01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:40.189
Except you.
That's a first for me.

592
01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:42.629
What are you looking so happy about?

593
01:10:42.653 --> 01:10:45.530
Come at me like you're ready to die.
Round-cropping!

594
01:10:45.554 --> 01:10:47.154
I understand!

595
01:10:47.178 --> 01:10:51.178
It was Sakuragi who created this rhythm.
Sakuragi was the one who created this rhythm.

596
01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.880
Huh? You're here?

597
01:10:58.904 --> 01:11:00.404
Round-cropped!

598
01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.180
Sawakita!

599
01:11:08.204 --> 01:11:10.204
I won't go!

600
01:11:15.515 --> 01:11:17.115
I'm surprised you stopped!

601
01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:20.649
Don't make me give you a fucking pass!
Are you sleeping? Kitsune!

602
01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:22.330
What?

603
01:11:24.754 --> 01:11:26.754
You're a whack job!
- What?

604
01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.029
We're going to be number one in Japan.
For all the hype...

605
01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:32.709
That little prick.
Can't seem to get a hold of you.

606
01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:36.833
Hmm!
- You're a shikato? Golla.

607
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:39.489
Let's play defense.
Sakuragi!

608
01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:43.919
Hey. is that all you got?

609
01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.349
Crush it!

610
01:11:48.873 --> 01:11:50.873
I'll take it.

611
01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:57.110
Switch!
(Marks switching)

612
01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.340
(W clutch: one person time difference)

613
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:03.840
Huh? He's still here...

614
01:12:07.864 --> 01:12:09.864
Quick attack!

615
01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.280
Oh. shoot!

616
01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:21.879
Oh oh oh!

617
01:12:21.903 --> 01:12:23.903
That's an 8-point difference!

618
01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:28.509
Must have been a no-mark...

619
01:12:28.533 --> 01:12:30.533
Shohoku...

620
01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:34.557
That first-year duo...
I'll put that freshman duo on...

621
01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:36.869
A little bit.
It's going to be a pain in the ass.

622
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:40.959
It all depends on whether we can keep those two at bay.
If we can keep those two at bay.

623
01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.839
If you get hit...
You can do it back.

624
01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:48.340
Triple it.

625
01:12:49.464 --> 01:12:51.964
Pass. please. Mr. Fukatsu.

626
01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:57.288
Hit it! Go!

627
01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.520
Come on. Cap!

628
01:13:08.544 --> 01:13:10.544
Go!

629
01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.450
what

630
01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:39.789
Same age.
Is there anyone else like him?

631
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.139
For seventeen years. I've been--

632
01:13:41.163 --> 01:13:44.563
All you think about is basketball.
I'm sure you've been thinking about it.

633
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:47.700
But...
You're the same way. aren't you?

634
01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.540
I pulled it out!
- No...

635
01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:58.064
Fukatsu-san. get it out!

636
01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:01.009
Oh!

637
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:05.109
Shoot!

638
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:10.879
It's a magre!

639
01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:28.779
The best player in Japan
Do you want to be? Ryukawa

640
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:30.483
Shut up!

641
01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:32.649
You'd better be.

642
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:35.020
In Japan without me.

643
01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.440
Prepare Don!

644
01:14:45.464 --> 01:14:47.464
Wait!

645
01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.299
High school basketball.
I did what I could.

646
01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:18.239
I have nothing more to prove.
I have nothing more to prove.

647
01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.659
Give me the experience I need.

648
01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:25.689
If there is still something--

649
01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:30.230
Give it to me.

650
01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:41.819
56789123

651
01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:43.929
Three hundred...

652
01:15:45.653 --> 01:15:48.153
This is nice.

653
01:15:58.370 --> 01:16:00.309
Oh...

654
01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:05.040
You can't beat me in a one-on-one.
You can't beat me.

655
01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:12.840
That Ryukawa...
How could he be so brilliant?

656
01:16:16.164 --> 01:16:18.164
not yet

657
01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:33.170
Red boy. this is...
You can't fly this thing.

658
01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:35.430
The first thing to do is to not let it fly.

659
01:16:35.454 --> 01:16:38.454
I'll take the ball.
Then we'll see.

660
01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.900
What's the matter?
Have you given up already?

661
01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:09.089
Still...

662
01:17:09.113 --> 01:17:11.113
Go! You're the ace!

663
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:14.360
The goal is unprotected!

664
01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:21.184
Foul! White!

665
01:17:24.208 --> 01:17:26.208
Son of a bitch!

666
01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:41.259
You're a big deal...

667
01:17:41.370 --> 01:17:43.309
He said he's the best player in Japan.

668
01:17:45.010 --> 01:17:47.539
Two years like me. Still.

669
01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:50.740
I want to see the look of frustration on his face.

670
01:17:53.764 --> 01:17:56.964
Me too.
- I know. right?

671
01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:02.180
You know. you're the first person I've ever talked to.
I've never talked to you before. have I?

672
01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:14.769
That was a good game.
- Yeah. it was.

673
01:18:14.770 --> 01:18:19.170
Good game.
- Shohoku is a good team.

674
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:28.019
Hey! Five guys on the court.
You're up against some serious competition.

675
01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:32.440
Let's fight to the end on the bench. too.

676
01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:53.940
All right!

677
01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.940
You still don't get it?

678
01:19:03.964 --> 01:19:06.364
You can't beat Sawakita.

679
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:15.610
What is it?

680
01:19:17.634 --> 01:19:19.634
We're stuck.

681
01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.080
Nagaregawa 6 seconds!

682
01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:29.589
You will have 30 seconds. 4 seconds left!

683
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:34.049
Where are you going?

684
01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:47.489
Foul!

685
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:52.230
Teacher!

686
01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:54.254
Boss!
- I got it!

687
01:19:54.278 --> 01:19:56.336
That Nagaregawa...

688
01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.750
This guy passes...

689
01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:02.900
Good call.

690
01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.329
Enter!

691
01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:11.830
Pass!

692
01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:20.650
Nagaregawa!

693
01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:28.839
This is it.
He's getting in on it.

694
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.330
And he's not the same guy I've seen before.
He's a little different.

695
01:20:33.354 --> 01:20:35.354
Do it to the fullest! Streams of water

696
01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:45.680
Ooh! All right!

697
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.100
Okay!

698
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:51.929
They came to stop me.

699
01:20:51.953 --> 01:20:54.453
I can't even lift my arms anymore.
I can't even lift my arms.

700
01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:57.970
I knew it. I knew it.
He's already reached his limit.

701
01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.940
3 minutes left

702
01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.750
(Also) 13 points...

703
01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:13.000
Quick attack!

704
01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.000
He can't hit!

705
01:21:23.024 --> 01:21:25.524
You don't have the balls for this.

706
01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.139
Be quiet!

707
01:21:30.163 --> 01:21:35.163
The sound of this (threesome)...
Revives me.

708
01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.179
As many times as you want!

709
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:41.800
Yay! Ten more points!

710
01:21:42.524 --> 01:21:46.024
What the hell is that?
They're catching up! (Sanno's cheering squad)

711
01:21:46.048 --> 01:21:48.048
Reluctant...

712
01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:53.220
Huh!

713
01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:57.420
All right!

714
01:21:57.444 --> 01:22:00.044
I'm going to treasure this one!

715
01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:13.980
This guy!
(LOOP SHOOTING)

716
01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:16.459
Yeah!

717
01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:25.359
Two minutes and 50 seconds left.
Eight points. I don't know.

718
01:22:25.383 --> 01:22:27.383
All right! - All right!

719
01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:31.119
A possibility emerged.

720
01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.809
Gori. Nagaregawa...
They'll pass us again.

721
01:22:35.833 --> 01:22:38.709
He ain't gonna pass...

722
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:42.310
Because I ain't never lost before.
- Ho!

723
01:22:50.290 --> 01:22:53.290
Oh! - Oh...

724
01:22:53.314 --> 01:22:55.314
Yes. yes. yes! Did you see that?

725
01:22:55.338 --> 01:22:57.838
Genius strategy. right on target!

726
01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:02.459
Okay. I'm ready! Just a little over two minutes to go!

727
01:23:02.483 --> 01:23:04.936
By eight points! Ball over here!

728
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.919
Gori. you can still make it. right?

729
01:23:08.343 --> 01:23:10.396
I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it!
- I can do it. I can do it. I can do it.

730
01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:15.339
This guy (Fukatsu) is upset or something.
Don't you think he's upset?

731
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:18.869
It's hitting me!

732
01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:24.560
Pick it up!
- Don't give up! You can pick it up!

733
01:23:24.584 --> 01:23:26.584
The way out of the way!

734
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:38.720
Huh!

735
01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:48.090
Referee time!

736
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:59.070
Sakuragi...

737
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:09.699
You did a good job.
Not bad. but...

738
01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:14.199
Who's not good enough?
Goraa!

739
01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.800
You're alive?
- Of course I'm alive!

740
01:24:16.824 --> 01:24:18.824
Can you do it?
- Oh. yes!

741
01:24:19.548 --> 01:24:23.548
This one is very important!
Go. Shohoku!

742
01:24:23.572 --> 01:24:27.572
Who is it?
- Shohoku! Shohoku!

743
01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:39.460
(Cheering loudly from the enemy's cheering section! )

744
01:24:44.710 --> 01:24:47.910
How many times do I have to push you?
You're gonna give up?

745
01:24:47.934 --> 01:24:51.234
Come on. make some noise!
Make some noise!

746
01:24:53.258 --> 01:24:55.258
What the...?

747
01:24:57.370 --> 01:24:58.780
It is a game!

748
01:24:58.804 --> 01:25:00.004
Oh!

749
01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:06.280
Faydaway! (back flips)
- Good!

750
01:25:06.304 --> 01:25:08.304
No. it's not!

751
01:25:08.328 --> 01:25:10.328
Rebounding!

752
01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:28.020
All right. let's get going!

753
01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:34.940
It's quiet...

754
01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.189
My heart is racing.

755
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:43.120
I'm going to pretend as hard as I can that I'm okay.

756
01:25:48.144 --> 01:25:49.344
You idiot...

757
01:25:49.530 --> 01:25:51.759
Still afraid of Kawada?

758
01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:58.479
You're gonna have to switch.
Not if you can't keep up.

759
01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.109
Do you want to pass? Pass it?

760
01:26:04.110 --> 01:26:05.830
You forgot one thing.

761
01:26:14.730 --> 01:26:17.700
3 points!
- Timeout. Yamao.

762
01:26:17.724 --> 01:26:20.724
Wow! Five points difference!
I can do it. I can do it.

763
01:26:21.748 --> 01:26:23.748
Ugh!

764
01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:26.939
Oh. God. it's hurting more and more.

765
01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:29.629
Does it hurt anywhere? Hanamichi Sakuragi

766
01:26:29.730 --> 01:26:33.459
No. my back is a little...

767
01:26:33.483 --> 01:26:36.083
Where in the back? What kind of pain?

768
01:26:36.107 --> 01:26:39.107
Just a twinge now and then.
I'm fine. Ugh!

769
01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.600
It's a matter of life and death for the athletes.

770
01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.970
Huh... Ha...

771
01:26:53.994 --> 01:26:55.994
Don't run away.

772
01:26:59.618 --> 01:27:01.618
Here.

773
01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:04.859
I'm not gonna stop the flow...

774
01:27:04.883 --> 01:27:06.636
Can you run?

775
01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:08.490
I can't lift my arm anymore.

776
01:27:08.514 --> 01:27:10.814
Okay. I'll pass.

777
01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:19.999
Dad. you can turn this around. can't you? Oh!
- Of course I can.

778
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.869
Mr. Sakuragi is on this team.
Rebounding and--

779
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:25.346
They added guts.

780
01:27:26.170 --> 01:27:28.670
Mr. Miyagi.
Speed and Sensitivity.

781
01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:34.110
Mr. Mitsui used to be a mess.

782
01:27:34.134 --> 01:27:38.134
Later on. intelligence and
a special kind of flying start.

783
01:27:39.558 --> 01:27:44.158
You. Mr. Ryukawa. are explosive.
and the will to win.

784
01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:49.279
Akagi-kun and Kigure-kun have been
On a foundation that has been supported by

785
01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:52.280
So much more has been
Added

786
01:27:52.304 --> 01:27:55.004
That's Shohoku.

787
01:27:58.028 --> 01:28:02.028
Come on. let's go!
- Shohoku! - SANOHO!

788
01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:12.340
We're not...
We're not the best of friends.

789
01:28:12.345 --> 01:28:15.345
You people.
I'm so angry at you.

790
01:28:15.369 --> 01:28:17.369
But...

791
01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:21.769
But what?

792
01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:24.909
No. I... Thank you.

793
01:28:24.933 --> 01:28:26.133
An?

794
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:27.970
You idiot!
- Thank you for what?

795
01:28:27.973 --> 01:28:29.373
I'm not doing it for you!
- It's about winning!

796
01:28:29.418 --> 01:28:31.418
Get out of here!

797
01:28:32.642 --> 01:28:36.842
Hey. you fuckers!
Here we go! - Oh!

798
01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:45.130
Fukatsu followed me.

799
01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:48.154
It wasn't me!

800
01:28:48.178 --> 01:28:51.178
There's a lot of pressure on the people being chased.
There must be pressure.

801
01:28:59.302 --> 01:29:01.602
Yes. I'm talking to the other side.

802
01:29:02.426 --> 01:29:04.426
Strongest Mountain King!

803
01:29:04.450 --> 01:29:07.150
As expected!
- Fukatsu & Kawada!

804
01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.040
Put me through!

805
01:29:14.433 --> 01:29:15.933
Lyota!

806
01:29:15.957 --> 01:29:17.657
Domoto-kun...

807
01:29:17.681 --> 01:29:20.181
I have no intention of making a clean getaway.
I have no intention of doing that.

808
01:29:20.210 --> 01:29:22.520
Until the last round.
I'm going to challenge you to a fight.

809
01:29:22.544 --> 01:29:24.544
That's what you get from these undefeated guys.

810
01:29:24.548 --> 01:29:26.548
I'm the best at it.
Style.

811
01:29:26.572 --> 01:29:28.572
Ryo-chan!

812
01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:31.196
Lyota!
Get out of here. You're a man!

813
01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:51.319
Mom. is it small? - Yeah.
- Yes.

814
01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:55.799
I'm skinny enough to pay for it.

815
01:29:57.300 --> 01:30:00.529
What did you say?
- Nothing.

816
01:30:04.930 --> 01:30:07.930
Here you go. The star of the show.
I made it big.

817
01:30:07.954 --> 01:30:09.954
You're bigger than me.

818
01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:12.749
I'll plate it for you.

819
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:19.800
Siblings with the same birthday
It's rare. isn't it?

820
01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:31.720
That means we're special.

821
01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:51.180
Ryoo. tomorrow.
What time do you leave?

822
01:30:51.185 --> 01:30:53.185
Hiroshima Inter-High School

823
01:30:53.209 --> 01:30:55.216
6 o'clock.
- Hasty!

824
01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:57.319
Mom. it's 6:00!

825
01:30:57.343 --> 01:30:59.343
hmm

826
01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:03.230
Ryou-chan
Seventeen years old. huh?

827
01:31:03.254 --> 01:31:05.254
Where's Thor?

828
01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:14.060
Let's see... 20.

829
01:31:15.684 --> 01:31:17.684
If he's still alive.

830
01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.080
Twenty years old...

831
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:37.030
You've been three years ahead of me for years.
I've already passed you.

832
01:31:41.290 --> 01:31:43.909
So-chan's Photo
Let's decorate it.

833
01:31:44.410 --> 01:31:46.140
I forget the face...

834
01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:20.509
It's been eight years.

835
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:27.319
Seventeen years old. Congratulations.

836
01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:31.010
Thank you.

837
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:45.739
Mother... What?

838
01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.639
Mother.

839
01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.409
I've been causing all kinds of trouble.

840
01:33:52.410 --> 01:33:55.410
I'm sorry for always bothering you.

841
01:33:55.434 --> 01:33:58.434
I'm sure you didn't want to play basketball.

842
01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:03.140
Because it reminds me of Thor.

843
01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:05.420
Still...

844
01:34:05.425 --> 01:34:09.925
Not once did he tell me to stop playing basketball.
I was never told to stop playing basketball.

845
01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:13.420
When I was a minibus player...

846
01:34:13.444 --> 01:34:17.444
It was nice of you to come and watch the game.
I was so happy.

847
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:29.829
A. 100 to 20

848
01:34:40.970 --> 01:34:43.619
In a world without Thor

849
01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:48.320
Basketball was the only thing that kept me alive.
Was the only thing that kept me alive.

850
01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:57.250
Thank you for keeping me going.
Thank you.

851
01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:10.040
Don't do it! How many times have I told you!

852
01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:26.140
Oh. Mother. Oh. my God!

853
01:35:35.050 --> 01:35:39.090
I don't know...
What should I do?

854
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:39.330
I'm glad you're keeping up with basketball.

855
01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.779
So-chan...
Where you were supposed to stand...

856
01:36:46.003 --> 01:36:48.003
Tomorrow...

857
01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.440
I'm going to stand.

858
01:36:57.464 --> 01:36:59.464
Hurry up. come on!

859
01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:04.380
Lower center of gravity!

860
01:37:07.604 --> 01:37:09.604
Good luck!

861
01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:17.140
Damn!
- You're losing your edge.

862
01:37:17.164 --> 01:37:21.350
What are you gonna do with all these big guys blocking you?
What are you gonna do when you're blocked by these big bastards?

863
01:37:21.774 --> 01:37:23.774
Go!

864
01:37:24.798 --> 01:37:26.798
Go!

865
01:37:27.822 --> 01:37:29.822
Go! Lyota!

866
01:37:30.850 --> 01:37:33.599
Dribbling is the way to go.

867
01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:36.450
It's the little guy's way of life!

868
01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:52.740
Go! Lyota!

869
01:37:54.164 --> 01:37:56.664
Defence!
Defense!

870
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:35.939
Free throws are number four.

871
01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:38.429
My free throws.
Sakuragi.

872
01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:43.350
Ha! Oh...

873
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:57.489
No count?

874
01:38:57.490 --> 01:39:03.999
Screw you. you genius.
Slam dunk.

875
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.099
You know. I was gonna take you down sooner or later.
I was going to take you down sooner or later. but...

876
01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:13.800
Wait a minute.
I don't switch.

877
01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:20.250
When I ran into that loose ball earlier...
When I ran into that loose ball earlier...

878
01:39:20.254 --> 01:39:23.254
It was sore.
- Where?

879
01:39:23.278 --> 01:39:25.278
（Ayako. don't tell me... (Ayaako)

880
01:39:25.302 --> 01:39:27.302
Back...

881
01:39:27.326 --> 01:39:29.326
back (of body)

882
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:32.350
A player's life is--

883
01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:34.789
Maybe...

884
01:39:34.813 --> 01:39:36.813
Does this mean it's over?

885
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:42.810
Does that mean I can't play basketball anymore?
I can't play basketball anymore?

886
01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:57.279
Do you like basketball?
- Ha. ha!

887
01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:01.719
I love it.
I'm a sportsman.

888
01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:05.369
Brothers?

889
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:18.020
Okay. yes!

890
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.579
Last one!

891
01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:29.140
The left hand only attaches

892
01:40:29.664 --> 01:40:32.664
Rebound King
National Debut!

893
01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:45.400
good

894
01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:59.690
Hanamichi... I've been waiting for you.
Troubled boy.

895
01:41:01.014 --> 01:41:04.014
Chickenshit!
A player's life...

896
01:41:09.190 --> 01:41:11.940
Akagi. decide...

897
01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:24.140
Adoption!

898
01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.169
Please take your turn!

899
01:41:28.745 --> 01:41:31.245
Hanamichi! Sakuragi-kun!

900
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:32.589
What are you doing?

901
01:41:32.613 --> 01:41:34.613
Sakuragi
- Mr. Sakuragi.

902
01:41:34.637 --> 01:41:36.259
Ryouchin. I'm coming!

903
01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:40.960
Until then. please stay under the goal!

904
01:41:43.784 --> 01:41:46.384
Hanamichi Sakuragi
Don't be unreasonable!

905
01:41:46.408 --> 01:41:47.786
Come!

906
01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:50.709
Look. I can barely stand up.
I can barely stand up!

907
01:41:50.733 --> 01:41:53.929
I'm sorry.
Change of shifts is canceled.

908
01:41:53.953 --> 01:41:55.306
Gora! Dad!

909
01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:59.789
Mr. Sakuragi.

910
01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:03.389
Confession.

911
01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:08.489
I knew something was wrong with you.
I noticed it right away.

912
01:42:08.513 --> 01:42:10.513
You're aware of it. but...

913
01:42:10.517 --> 01:42:12.517
I didn't replace him.

914
01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:15.209
It just keeps getting better and better.
You're playing...

915
01:42:15.214 --> 01:42:17.214
Because I wanted to watch.

916
01:42:19.710 --> 01:42:21.989
Failure to teach.

917
01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:26.019
I was so close.
I would have regretted it the rest of my life.

918
01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:33.279
One minute left!
Let's shout it out together. Sakuragi!

919
01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:40.509
When were my dad's glory days?

920
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:42.370
Was it at All-Japan?

921
01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:46.590
I'm...

922
01:43:04.890 --> 01:43:07.180
I'm now!

923
01:43:15.604 --> 01:43:17.604
Red! Pushing!

924
01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:25.649
Hey. you're an eyesore.

925
01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:30.590
That's where you're standing.
Standing there in a daze.

926
01:43:31.614 --> 01:43:34.414
If you're going to answer. answer!
Douchebag!

927
01:43:37.038 --> 01:43:39.038
Shift.

928
01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:44.020
Are you leaving?

929
01:43:49.044 --> 01:43:51.344
Hanamichi!
- Are you okay?

930
01:43:52.570 --> 01:43:55.549
Nuh... What's wrong?
You look so serious.

931
01:43:55.950 --> 01:43:58.429
I'm sorry you're having such a hard time.
Without me?

932
01:43:58.430 --> 01:44:01.529
For this genius.
Just the right handicap.

933
01:44:01.553 --> 01:44:03.953
I'm about as good as Yamao.
I'll take that.

934
01:44:07.530 --> 01:44:09.889
You're going to win. right? Gori.

935
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:13.799
It's just a passing thing. isn't it?
They're something!

936
01:44:14.823 --> 01:44:18.623
Why should the lowest of the low
Why should I listen to you?

937
01:44:22.270 --> 01:44:24.270
Hey!

938
01:44:24.294 --> 01:44:26.294
Come!

939
01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:36.229
They're gonna press again.
They're gonna come after me.

940
01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:39.389
Nagaregawa. when you come to Hamet...
You carry it...

941
01:44:39.403 --> 01:44:41.456
We can just keep going.
Let's go.

942
01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.966
Male!
- Danna.

943
01:44:42.990 --> 01:44:45.089
Watch the stream.

944
01:44:45.090 --> 01:44:46.490
Okay. okay.

945
01:44:51.210 --> 01:44:56.210
You know...
We can do it.

947
01:45:02.864 --> 01:45:05.364

948
01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:12.380
123 Win!

949
01:45:12.404 --> 01:45:14.404
Come on. Sanno!

950
01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:25.280
Five points with one minute to go.
They're really trying to catch up!

951
01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:43.780
Targeted!

952
01:45:43.804 --> 01:45:44.804
Idiot!

953
01:45:44.828 --> 01:45:47.328
Ike. Mikio!

954
01:45:57.952 --> 01:45:59.952
Here we go. Nagaregawa!

955
01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:05.260
Defense!

956
01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:26.340
Count. three.

One Throw!

958
01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:44.380
You did a good job running. Mitsui.

959
01:46:50.404 --> 01:46:52.804
I'm glad I joined Shohoku.

960
01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:04.070
If you make it this far
It's a game of the mind

961
01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:09.969
How sure of
How certain can you be of who you are?

962
01:47:10.370 --> 01:47:14.050
How far do you believe in yourself?
How far do you believe in yourself?

963
01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:37.240
Woohoo haha!

964
01:47:38.274 --> 01:47:39.574
One point difference!

965
01:47:43.098 --> 01:47:44.398
Four minutes!

966
01:47:44.422 --> 01:47:46.422
47 46 45 44

967
01:47:47.122 --> 01:47:49.922
We have to defend it!
Don't let them get it!

968
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:55.370
Sakuragi. hang in there...

Good luck! Akagi

973
01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.050
Augh!

974
01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:27.040
Go!

975
01:48:27.064 --> 01:48:29.064
Return...

976
01:48:38.488 --> 01:48:40.888
Stop! Quick. stop!

977
01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:50.060
The End!

[ Gooooooooooooooooooooooooo...]

980
01:49:40.355 --> 01:49:42.355
"Director Doumoto's intentions."

981
01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:44.680
（Sakuragi is at his limit.)

982
01:49:44.704 --> 01:49:46.904
（Then it's a 5-4 situation.)

983
01:49:46.928 --> 01:49:49.728
( In lieu of relinquishing the last T.O. - )

984
01:49:49.752 --> 01:49:51.752

Yay!

988
01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:38.250
How was Sanno?

989
01:54:45.110 --> 01:54:47.670
Strong.

990
01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:59.670
I was scared.

991
01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:11.179
Ryoo-chan

992
01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:16.169
yeah

993
01:55:16.770 --> 01:55:18.849
What?

994
01:55:24.850 --> 01:55:27.410
welcome home

995
01:55:31.330 --> 01:55:33.879
I'm home!

996
01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:40.389
Have you grown taller?
- What? No way.

997
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:43.450
How can it grow in four days?

998
01:56:01.770 --> 01:56:03.680
Thor's...

999
01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:22.140
Ryo-chan!

1000
01:56:23.564 --> 01:56:25.564
Ryo-chan. welcome back!

1001
01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:38.400
Wait. hey. hey! Hey. hey. hey!

1002
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:51.159
Let's go up.

1003
01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:54.330
The fact that I've lost before--

1004
01:56:54.335 --> 01:56:57.835
Someday it will be a great asset.

1005
01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.500
I need it.
I need experience.

1006

Lyota and Sawakita at

1007
01:57:38.410 --> 01:57:41.359
Since I've been here.
Anything different?

1008
01:57:41.383 --> 01:57:43.183
It's physical (Sawakita).

1009
01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:46.059
Everyone around me was like. "Mr. Kawada.
It's like...

1010
01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:48.929
What are the challenges ahead?

1011
01:57:49.553 --> 01:57:52.353
I'm on the smaller side.
I play point guard.

1012
01:57:52.530 --> 01:57:53.889
Not quite there yet.

1013
01:57:53.913 --> 01:57:56.913
You can't help yourself.
Go too far.

1014
01:57:57.590 --> 01:58:01.130
Such a long way.
Thank you for your hard work (Sawakita)
