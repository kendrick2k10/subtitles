3
00:01:01.887 --> 00:01:02.932
Okay.

4
00:01:20.732 --> 00:01:22.430
Front door opening.

5
00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:25.868
Front door closing.

6
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:27.261
Mama?

7
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.789
Motion
detected. third floor.

8
00:01:33.832 --> 00:01:36.183
Up here. sweetie.
I'm in your bedroom.

9
00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:38.707
Motion detected. third floor.

10
00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:45.975
In here.

11
00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:53.461
There's my little girl.

12
00:01:57.856 --> 00:01:59.380
All clear.

13
00:02:10.304 --> 00:02:13.959
-Aren't these stairs
just exquisite?
-They're beautiful.

14
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.571
The home comes fully furnished
with all of the owners'

15
00:02:16.614 --> 00:02:20.488
luxurious furnishings
and sublime decorations.

16
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:22.446
I just love this bedroom.

17
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.492
It's so stylish and sexy.

18
00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:27.625
But follow me.
You're gonna love this.

19
00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.976
His and her bathtubs.

20
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.415
-Okay. I was not expecting that.
-Don't you just love it?

21
00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:36.721
Why are you relocating
from Mexico City?

22
00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:38.723
We just needed
a change of scenery.

23
00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:39.811
Oh.

24
00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:46.253
Oh. that's the owner.

25
00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:47.776
He's a really fun guy.

26
00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:52.955
The kitchen is furnished
with the highest quality
appliances--

27
00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:55.653
Wolf. Sub-Zero. Miele.

28
00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:58.830
You've got your luxurious
custom cabinetry.

29
00:02:58.874 --> 00:03:00.528
Italian imported marble counter.

30
00:03:03.357 --> 00:03:06.403
I guess your English
isn't as good as you thought.

31
00:03:06.447 --> 00:03:08.275
It even has
a built-in microwave.

32
00:03:09.885 --> 00:03:12.714
Look. guys. I would love
to let you have this place.

33
00:03:12.757 --> 00:03:15.456
but I need to know
that you're committed.

34
00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.024
The previous tenant
just vanished with several
months left on the lease.

35
00:03:19.068 --> 00:03:20.983
The owner does not want
to deal with that again.

36
00:03:21.026 --> 00:03:23.377
We are ready to move in today.

37
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.944
-Whatever it takes.
-That's great to hear.

38
00:03:25.988 --> 00:03:28.120
Houses like this
do not come up that often.

39
00:03:28.164 --> 00:03:30.035
Can we do one more walkthrough
on the second floor?

40
00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.429
-Of course.
-But alone so we can discuss?

41
00:03:32.473 --> 00:03:35.432
Oh. right. Certainly.

42
00:03:35.476 --> 00:03:36.781
Thank you.

43
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.356
The first thing we should do
is take his and her baths. huh?

44
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.665
Oh. well that sounds
very exquisite and luxurious.

45
00:03:52.928 --> 00:03:54.756
It's kind of weird. right.

46
00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.975
with all of the owner's
strange decorations?

47
00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.977
I'm surprised
you actually don't like them.

48
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:01.980
They remind me
of the stuff that you get
in the markets in Coyoacan.

49
00:04:02.024 --> 00:04:04.418
-I miss Coyoacan.
-And we'll get back there.

50
00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:07.986
But right now. we need
a place for you to rest
and get back on your feet.

51
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.988
Okay. we're Californians now!

52
00:04:14.036 --> 00:04:17.692
Mi amor.Eva.
bebecita. what's wrong?

53
00:04:17.735 --> 00:04:19.389
Nothing.

54
00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:23.654
Isn't there a place
in a gated community.

55
00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:26.091
preferably
with a security guard?

56
00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:28.616
This is a safe house
in a safe neighborhood.

57
00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.054
Our neighborhood in Mexico City
was supposed to be safe.

58
00:04:32.097 --> 00:04:35.362
And besides.
this place is too big
for just the two of us.

59
00:04:35.405 --> 00:04:37.799
Mmm. Now see.
that's where you're wrong.

60
00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:39.496
We're gonna have
an enormous family.

61
00:04:42.107 --> 00:04:44.980
And we should
probably get started right now.

62
00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:50.246
Oh. snap!

63
00:04:51.247 --> 00:04:54.381
-Not now!
-Ugh! Boring!

64
00:04:54.424 --> 00:04:55.860
Ugh...

65
00:05:04.173 --> 00:05:06.610
There's one more feature
I'd like to show you.

66
00:05:06.654 --> 00:05:10.179
It's the real reason
you want to rent a home
like this.

67
00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:13.356
A state-of-the-art
security system.

68
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.837
The latest in smart home
security tech.

69
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.144
It connects to your phone.
laptop. and mounted wall unit.

70
00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:22.409
Not only the alarm system.
but also lights.

71
00:05:22.452 --> 00:05:24.672
temperature. everything.

72
00:05:24.715 --> 00:05:27.718
-Are you good with technology?
-He's almost mastered texting.

73
00:05:27.762 --> 00:05:31.766
-I rely on her.
-Oh. then you'll love
all the functions and gadgets.

74
00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:33.681
Security cameras
are throughout the house.

75
00:05:33.724 --> 00:05:36.205
which can be accessed
by your phone or computer.

76
00:05:36.248 --> 00:05:38.250
All doors and windows
are alarmed.

77
00:05:38.294 --> 00:05:42.211
No one is getting in here
unless you let them.

78
00:05:42.254 --> 00:05:47.042
It's even got a scary name--
"Die-ablo" Controls.

79
00:05:49.044 --> 00:05:51.568
-Everything okay?
-Mm.

80
00:05:51.612 --> 00:05:55.920
Yeah. it's just pronounced
"Diablo."

81
00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:12.894
Access denied.

82
00:06:12.937 --> 00:06:16.724
Motion detected. third floor.

83
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:23.774
Hello?

84
00:06:25.776 --> 00:06:28.213
Eva? Miguel?

85
00:06:29.432 --> 00:06:32.827
You're not working
on those niños.are you?

86
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.047
Motion detected. second floor.

87
00:06:36.091 --> 00:06:37.614
Okay. never mind.

88
00:06:41.183 --> 00:06:43.664
Motion detected. staircase.

89
00:06:54.762 --> 00:06:56.328
All clear.

90
00:07:58.782 --> 00:08:00.262
This is kind of weird.

91
00:08:00.305 --> 00:08:03.091
Yeah. it's not as sexy
as I thought it was gonna be.

92
00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:08.792
Well. should we try
squeezing into one?

93
00:08:08.836 --> 00:08:12.013
Oh. Miguel. you don't even
fit into that one.

94
00:08:12.056 --> 00:08:15.059
Oh. I'll make it fit.

95
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:22.110
-Who keeps texting you?
-It's just work.

96
00:08:22.153 --> 00:08:25.243
What's so important
that they're texting
20 times in a row?

97
00:08:26.027 --> 00:08:28.333
Well. they need me
in Mexico City.

98
00:08:29.247 --> 00:08:30.335
When?

99
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.338
Tonight.

100
00:08:42.304 --> 00:08:45.699
I can't believe this.
you're packing to leave
before we've even unpacked.

101
00:08:45.742 --> 00:08:48.005
You know I don't have a choice.

102
00:08:48.049 --> 00:08:51.269
Can't you spend the night here
and fly out first thing
tomorrow morning?

103
00:08:51.313 --> 00:08:53.576
I told you there's
a client dinner tonight. amor.

104
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.709
I can't be alone
in this big house.

105
00:08:55.752 --> 00:08:57.493
There are 10 million
light switches.

106
00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.364
and I don't know
how to lock the doors yet.

107
00:08:59.408 --> 00:09:00.757
You'll figure it out. okay?

108
00:09:00.801 --> 00:09:03.586
I'm gone for a week.
Not even. just five days.

109
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.849
-I'm coming with you.
-No. Eva!

110
00:09:05.893 --> 00:09:09.766
We literally just left there
because you didn't feel safe.

111
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.985
You're safe here.

112
00:09:12.464 --> 00:09:14.379
Okay. this place
is like a resort.

113
00:09:14.423 --> 00:09:16.338
It's quiet. it's peaceful.

114
00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:20.560
Look. a break like this
is exactly what you needed
to recharge.

115
00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:24.259
We've been planning for this.

116
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.957
You've got your program.

117
00:09:32.441 --> 00:09:33.660
Okay.

118
00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:38.403
But what happened to...

119
00:09:38.447 --> 00:09:40.580
this big family we're starting ?

120
00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:43.974
Mm.

121
00:09:44.018 --> 00:09:46.107
Yes. coming out right now.

122
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.065
Oh. I am so late.

123
00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:50.981
If I miss that plane. I'm dead.
You're such a bad influence.

124
00:09:51.025 --> 00:09:52.374
Wait. what about the alarm?

125
00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:54.506
-What about it?
-How do I set it?

126
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.248
Oh. they're sending out
a tech guy tomorrow
to program it for us.

127
00:09:57.292 --> 00:09:59.511
Tomorrow?
What about tonight?

128
00:09:59.555 --> 00:10:01.949
Shit. this is crazy.

129
00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:04.691
-I'm sorry. babe.
I'm canceling the trip.
-Wait. no.

130
00:10:06.562 --> 00:10:09.521
-You should go. You have to go.
-What about the alarm?

131
00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:12.307
We're in a safe neighborhood.

132
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.439
We probably
don't even need an alarm.

133
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.051
-You sure?
-I'm sure.

134
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.315
Okay. I love you.

135
00:10:20.358 --> 00:10:21.533
All right.
Mwah! Bye.

136
00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:23.274
I gotta go.

137
00:10:26.495 --> 00:10:28.802
Love you.

138
00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:14.603
Invalid passcode.

139
00:12:17.432 --> 00:12:19.216
Invalid passcode.

140
00:12:23.003 --> 00:12:25.527
Thank you
for calling Diablo Controls.

141
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.268

142
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:29.574
The next agent will be
available in six minutes.

143
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.325
Your call is important to us.

144
00:12:41.369 --> 00:12:43.675
The next agent will be
available in six minutes.

145
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:56.036
Your call is important to us.

146
00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:58.473
The next agent will be
available in six minutes.

147
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.229
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

148
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.277
I'm feeling a little...

149
00:13:21.409 --> 00:13:27.371
scared and alone right now.

150
00:13:29.896 --> 00:13:31.593
First night and all.

151
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.595
So...

152
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.120
call me when you get this.

153
00:13:38.643 --> 00:13:39.949
I love you.

154
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.613
Elevated heart rate.

155
00:14:01.144 --> 00:14:03.059
It's 6:00 in the morning.

156
00:14:03.103 --> 00:14:04.756
Time to rise and shine.

157
00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:45.145
Ooh!

158
00:14:45.188 --> 00:14:47.408
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

159
00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:48.931
Oh. I'm sorry to disturb you.

160
00:14:48.975 --> 00:14:51.194
Um. I'm the technician
from Diablo Controls.

161
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.765
Do you usually just walk
into people's backyards?

162
00:14:56.808 --> 00:14:58.332
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

163
00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:00.160
I called.
and when no one picked up.

164
00:15:00.203 --> 00:15:02.510
I thought I'd just come by
and check the property.

165
00:15:02.553 --> 00:15:06.688
And then I saw you swimming
and. well. here we are.

166
00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:11.084
Yeah. okay.

167
00:15:11.127 --> 00:15:13.042
I'm gonna need you
to give me a minute.

168
00:15:13.086 --> 00:15:14.914
and I'll meet you
at the front door.

169
00:15:16.002 --> 00:15:17.090
Okay.

170
00:15:28.144 --> 00:15:30.407
Okay. punch in
the four-digit code.

171
00:15:30.451 --> 00:15:32.279
This will be
your personal passcode

172
00:15:32.322 --> 00:15:34.237
to activate
and deactivate the system.

173
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:36.587
So make sure you remember it
and don't tell anybody.

174
00:15:36.631 --> 00:15:38.372
Even me.

175
00:15:40.722 --> 00:15:42.767
Passcode confirmed.

176
00:15:44.334 --> 00:15:45.727
Okay. you remember it?

177
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.816
-Yep.
-Great.

178
00:15:47.859 --> 00:15:51.863
Uh. if the alarm is on
and you open a door
or a window.

179
00:15:51.907 --> 00:15:54.214
the alarm will go off
and it is really loud.

180
00:15:54.257 --> 00:15:56.520
If the code isn't entered
within 60 seconds.

181
00:15:56.564 --> 00:16:00.133
then an armed security
patrolman will be at your door
within 45 minutes.

182
00:16:00.176 --> 00:16:02.483
-Can I see your phone?
-Why?

183
00:16:02.526 --> 00:16:04.267
Just to sync it to the system

184
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:06.791
so that you can
control everything
from the palm of your hand.

185
00:16:06.835 --> 00:16:09.142
-Alerts and all.
-That necessary?

186
00:16:09.185 --> 00:16:10.839
It's highly recommended.

187
00:16:10.882 --> 00:16:14.408
For example.
if you leave the house
and someone breaks in.

188
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:17.280
the system will notify you
so you don't walk in on
an armed intruder.

189
00:16:17.324 --> 00:16:19.761
And it has
rapid video playback.

190
00:16:19.804 --> 00:16:22.416
so you can see exactly
where that intruder is
in your home.

191
00:16:25.027 --> 00:16:26.550
Smart woman.

192
00:16:26.594 --> 00:16:28.639
Okay.
I can even go deeper.

193
00:16:28.683 --> 00:16:31.991
It even tracks biometric data
like sleep patterns
and heart rate.

194
00:16:32.034 --> 00:16:36.256
Can we just stick with
the basic alarm system here?

195
00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:37.909
Gotcha.

196
00:16:37.953 --> 00:16:40.347
Just figured I'd ask because
the last family that lived here

197
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.262
had their entire lives
synced to the system.

198
00:16:42.305 --> 00:16:45.308
Is that why I get
a 6:00 a.m. wake-up call?

199
00:16:45.352 --> 00:16:48.007
That is exactly why.
I apologize for that.

200
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.357
Let me you fix that
for you. okay?

201
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.229
Okay. yeah.
so it's just basic AI

202
00:16:53.273 --> 00:16:56.232
that's gonna study you.
learn who you are.

203
00:16:56.276 --> 00:16:59.105
your behaviors. your patterns.
your movements.

204
00:16:59.148 --> 00:17:01.585
System ready.
Oh. You're all set.

205
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:04.545
From your phone.
you can control the lights.
the stereo.

206
00:17:04.588 --> 00:17:06.764
activate or deactivate
the alarm.

207
00:17:06.808 --> 00:17:08.462
You have access
to all the cameras.

208
00:17:08.505 --> 00:17:11.639
and the system will notify you
if it detects

209
00:17:11.682 --> 00:17:13.858
any unidentified motion.

210
00:17:13.902 --> 00:17:15.512
Why would it need
to detect motion?

211
00:17:15.556 --> 00:17:17.645
You'll want to know
where your threat
is coming from.

212
00:17:17.688 --> 00:17:19.125
That's a comforting thought.

213
00:17:19.168 --> 00:17:21.040
Yeah. don't worry about it
at all.

214
00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:22.998
This neighborhood
is super quiet.

215
00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.392
Nothing ever happens.

216
00:18:10.524 --> 00:18:11.829
All right.

217
00:18:24.015 --> 00:18:26.017
Entering sleep mode.

218
00:18:26.757 --> 00:18:28.803
You think you know me?

219
00:18:28.846 --> 00:18:31.022
You don't know
the first thing about me.

220
00:18:42.251 --> 00:18:44.688
Lights out. Good night.

221
00:19:11.628 --> 00:19:14.109
Motion detected. hallway.

222
00:19:19.506 --> 00:19:21.682
Motion detected. hallway.

223
00:19:42.442 --> 00:19:44.139
All clear.

224
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.601
It's 6:00 in the morning.

225
00:20:11.645 --> 00:20:13.124
Time to rise and shine.

226
00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:20.654
Too bright!

227
00:20:33.841 --> 00:20:35.625
Look who decided to call.

228
00:20:37.758 --> 00:20:39.629
I am so sorry. honestly.

229
00:20:39.673 --> 00:20:41.588
It's been back-to-back
meetings and dinners.

230
00:20:41.631 --> 00:20:44.373
Every time I try to call you.
there's a new fire
I gotta put out.

231
00:20:44.417 --> 00:20:48.290
Well. I'm on fire.
and it's not gonna be
so easy for you to put me out.

232
00:20:48.334 --> 00:20:51.293
You are on fire
and you're hot. hot. hot.

233
00:20:51.337 --> 00:20:53.600
And I am so dumb. dumb. dumb!

234
00:20:53.643 --> 00:20:55.428
I'm not disagreeing with you.

235
00:20:55.471 --> 00:20:57.473
In my defense. I didn't
get your voicemail

236
00:20:57.517 --> 00:20:59.040
about the alarm system
till today.

237
00:20:59.083 --> 00:21:00.824
It's okay.

238
00:21:00.868 --> 00:21:04.045
Um. everything is good.
actually.

239
00:21:04.088 --> 00:21:07.875
I'm settling in.
the house is great.
and I feel safe.

240
00:21:07.918 --> 00:21:11.095
Ah. you have no idea
how happy that makes me feel.

241
00:21:11.139 --> 00:21:14.142
-You got any plans for today?
-Uh. yes.

242
00:21:14.185 --> 00:21:18.494
I. too. have
a very important day
planned as well.

243
00:21:18.538 --> 00:21:21.105
I was just drinking
a single cup of coffee

244
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:23.760
and sending my resumé
to a recruiter.

245
00:21:23.804 --> 00:21:26.241
And now I'm going
to grab the newspaper

246
00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.896
and then I will read
said newspaper.

247
00:21:28.939 --> 00:21:30.985
And then after that.
I'll go for a jog.

248
00:21:31.028 --> 00:21:33.292
Nice. sounds like a full day.

249
00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:35.206
Did you figure out
the alarm system?

250
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.645
Yeah. the tech guy
came over yesterday
and helped set everything up.

251
00:21:39.646 --> 00:21:43.476
It's really complicated.
but I'm getting the hang of it.

252
00:21:46.043 --> 00:21:48.219
Sounds like it!

253
00:21:48.263 --> 00:21:50.526
Damn. I can't remember
the code! Fuck!

254
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:54.051
Did you try
your ATM PIN number.
or 1-2-3-4?

255
00:21:54.095 --> 00:21:56.837
Ha. very funny and helpful!

256
00:21:58.882 --> 00:22:01.102
All clear.

257
00:22:01.145 --> 00:22:03.626
Sorry! Not a burglar!

258
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:08.370
Just me trying to figure out
my alarm system.

259
00:22:08.414 --> 00:22:10.372
Wow. sounds like
you really mastered it.

260
00:22:10.416 --> 00:22:12.200
You're gonna have to teach me
when I get home.

261
00:22:12.243 --> 00:22:13.941
Yeah. right.

262
00:22:13.984 --> 00:22:16.378
I can't figure out if this thing
is going to protect me

263
00:22:16.422 --> 00:22:18.075
or if it's going to kill me.

264
00:22:24.778 --> 00:22:26.562
System armed.

265
00:22:31.132 --> 00:22:32.525
System disarmed.

266
00:22:38.052 --> 00:22:39.270
System armed.

267
00:22:40.794 --> 00:22:43.231
Why is everything
fucking complicated?

268
00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:48.802
Thank you
for calling Diablo Controls.

269
00:22:48.845 --> 00:22:50.586
Your call is important to us.

270
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.023
The next agent will be
available in six minutes.

271
00:22:55.243 --> 00:22:57.811
Screw it;
I'm not gonna be gone
that long anyway.

272
00:22:57.854 --> 00:23:00.553
System disarmed.

273
00:23:20.616 --> 00:23:23.489
Motion detected. front door.

274
00:23:47.904 --> 00:23:49.602
Hey there!

275
00:23:49.645 --> 00:23:51.342
I'm your neighbor. Nancy.

276
00:23:53.475 --> 00:23:55.999
Hi. I'm Eva.
Nice to meet you.

277
00:23:56.043 --> 00:23:58.132
Oh. these are for you.

278
00:24:00.526 --> 00:24:03.050
So. how you doing?
How's the house?

279
00:24:03.093 --> 00:24:05.139
This is very sweet of you.

280
00:24:05.182 --> 00:24:06.836
Everything's great.
We're very happy.

281
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.622
Well. if you need
anything at all.
you just holler.

282
00:24:09.665 --> 00:24:11.450
I've lived here
a long. long time.

283
00:24:11.493 --> 00:24:14.017
so I know all there is to know
about the neighborhood.

284
00:24:14.061 --> 00:24:15.323
Great.

285
00:24:15.366 --> 00:24:17.020
Have you joined
Neighbor Network yet?

286
00:24:17.064 --> 00:24:18.718
No. not yet.

287
00:24:18.761 --> 00:24:20.894
Oh. do yourself a favor
and join right away.

288
00:24:20.937 --> 00:24:22.678
It's a great resource.

289
00:24:22.722 --> 00:24:24.463
You'll meet all the neighbors.

290
00:24:24.506 --> 00:24:26.595
If anything happens
in the neighborhood at all.

291
00:24:26.639 --> 00:24:29.337
it'll be up on Neighbor Network
immediately.

292
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.209
If a crime has been committed.
it'll be up on the site

293
00:24:32.253 --> 00:24:34.037
before the police even arrive.

294
00:24:34.081 --> 00:24:37.693
Hey. it's how I found out
that I have you as my neighbor.

295
00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:38.955
Wow.

296
00:24:40.304 --> 00:24:42.089
Uh. I'm sorry. I have to go.

297
00:24:42.132 --> 00:24:44.265
but it was very nice
to meet you.

298
00:24:44.308 --> 00:24:46.833
-Oh. okay. Bye.
-Bye.

299
00:24:52.621 --> 00:24:54.014
Hmm.

300
00:25:45.674 --> 00:25:47.676
Motion detected. kitchen.

301
00:26:08.784 --> 00:26:10.438
I know you're in here!

302
00:26:18.881 --> 00:26:20.274
Aw. man.

303
00:26:21.144 --> 00:26:22.798
I loved that mug.

304
00:26:50.739 --> 00:26:52.872
Hmm.

305
00:26:54.395 --> 00:26:57.137
Dropped the package at 9:42.

306
00:27:00.575 --> 00:27:04.057
But the alert came at 9:48.

307
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.015
That's so weird.

308
00:27:21.988 --> 00:27:23.337
What the heck is that?

309
00:27:24.686 --> 00:27:26.514
That's weird.

310
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.663
How the hell
did they get my email?

311
00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:02.985
Well. that's pretty racist!

312
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:06.032
Looks like my new neighbors
aren't so neighborly after all.

313
00:28:11.907 --> 00:28:13.735
Oh. my God!

314
00:28:19.175 --> 00:28:21.525
Motion detected. front door.

315
00:28:24.224 --> 00:28:26.052
Thank you.

316
00:28:30.578 --> 00:28:32.319
...you are my hot fire.

317
00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.715
I'll see you again
in a few days.

318
00:28:36.758 --> 00:28:38.412
Love. Miguel."

319
00:28:38.455 --> 00:28:40.501
Good job. Miguel.

320
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.815
Analyzing video.

321
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.429
Downloading similar assets.

322
00:29:07.049 --> 00:29:09.617
S ix new
crime watch notifications
from Neighbor Network.

323
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.577
Hey. bro.
Open the fucking door. bro.

324
00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:18.408
Zero. six. six. zero.

325
00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:34.860
Elevated heart rate.

326
00:29:46.219 --> 00:29:48.047
-Hey.
-Hey.

327
00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:50.701
Uh. you okay? You sound like
something bad just happened.

328
00:29:50.745 --> 00:29:54.009
Yeah. something's happened.
Lots of things have happened.

329
00:29:54.053 --> 00:29:56.055
What are you talking about?
What happened?

330
00:29:56.098 --> 00:29:58.709
Julie's house
was just broken into
by two men wearing ski masks.

331
00:29:58.753 --> 00:29:59.885
Who the fuck is Julie?

332
00:29:59.928 --> 00:30:01.756
And then Frank's doorbell
recorded

333
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.063
a crazy man yelling
outside his door.

334
00:30:04.106 --> 00:30:05.934
And then Cynthia V.
just posted that--

335
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.591
Who are Julie and Frank?
What are you talking about?

336
00:30:10.634 --> 00:30:12.549
Our neighborhood
is not as safe as you think.

337
00:30:12.593 --> 00:30:14.203
Eva. tell me what happened.

338
00:30:15.204 --> 00:30:17.163
I signed up
on the Neighborhood
Network today.

339
00:30:17.206 --> 00:30:18.338
Oh. Jesus.

340
00:30:19.992 --> 00:30:21.776
I told you
not to do that. okay?

341
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.604
That site makes
everybody paranoid.

342
00:30:23.647 --> 00:30:25.258
It's real.

343
00:30:25.301 --> 00:30:28.087
They post photographs of people
breaking into their homes.

344
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.873
But they probably
don't have such a fancy.
impenetrable system like ours.

345
00:30:33.875 --> 00:30:35.442
Well. that's true.

346
00:30:37.052 --> 00:30:38.445
Where are you. by the way?

347
00:30:38.488 --> 00:30:41.665
Home.
I-- I mean. our old home.

348
00:30:42.884 --> 00:30:44.233
I miss it.

349
00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:46.540
I miss you.

350
00:30:46.583 --> 00:30:48.324
I miss you. too.

351
00:30:48.368 --> 00:30:50.500
Look. I've gotta go
to another client dinner.

352
00:30:50.544 --> 00:30:54.374
I just wanted to hear
your voice and make sure
that you got the flowers.

353
00:30:54.417 --> 00:30:55.810
I did.

354
00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:57.464
Thank you.
They're beautiful.

355
00:30:57.507 --> 00:30:58.813
Okay. All right.

356
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:01.076
Well. please. please. please
do me a favor

357
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.817
and cancel that membership.

358
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:03.905
Okay? I love you.

359
00:31:03.949 --> 00:31:05.428
Okay. I love you.

360
00:31:18.006 --> 00:31:20.487
Elevated heart rate.

361
00:31:29.975 --> 00:31:32.847
Elevated heart rate.

362
00:31:46.774 --> 00:31:48.123
Miguel?

363
00:33:19.301 --> 00:33:21.042
It's 6:00 in the morning.

364
00:33:21.086 --> 00:33:22.522
Time to rise and shine.

365
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:36.014
No. No. I don't have
an appointment

366
00:33:36.057 --> 00:33:39.191
and I don't live
in Mexico City anymore.

367
00:33:39.234 --> 00:33:42.759
I was just hoping
that she could squeeze me in

368
00:33:42.803 --> 00:33:44.805
for an emergency session.

369
00:34:12.093 --> 00:34:13.834
System disarmed.

370
00:34:26.847 --> 00:34:28.283
Hola. Eva!

371
00:34:35.899 --> 00:34:38.511
Of course.
I was hoping to hear from you.

372
00:34:38.554 --> 00:34:42.776
I just wasn't expecting it
to be so soon after your move.

373
00:34:42.819 --> 00:34:43.951
Is everything okay?

374
00:34:46.432 --> 00:34:50.175
Not really.
I have a dream again.

375
00:34:50.218 --> 00:34:52.481
-The nightmare.
-El Diablo.

376
00:34:54.135 --> 00:34:57.356
Eva. let's try
and sit down for a moment.

377
00:34:57.399 --> 00:34:58.835
We can calm down.

378
00:35:01.534 --> 00:35:03.623
I understand
dreams can be terrifying.

379
00:35:03.666 --> 00:35:05.842
especially when
they're so vivid.

380
00:35:05.886 --> 00:35:09.194
But El Diablo is not looking
for you in California.

381
00:35:09.237 --> 00:35:10.586
You know that.

382
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.501
It's common for people
who've gone through

383
00:35:12.545 --> 00:35:13.763
what you went through.

384
00:35:13.807 --> 00:35:15.374
truly believing
you were going to die.

385
00:35:15.417 --> 00:35:19.073
to suffer from
post-traumatic stress.

386
00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:21.554
There's no reason
why he let me live.

387
00:35:21.597 --> 00:35:24.774
-The police said that--
-I know what the police said.

388
00:35:24.818 --> 00:35:27.516
He killed two other women
that night he left my home.

389
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:31.172
It's not your fault.

390
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.135
I'm sorry for bothering you.
Dr. Olivares.

391
00:35:38.179 --> 00:35:40.964
We just moved into a new home

392
00:35:41.008 --> 00:35:44.620
and Miguel is away on business.

393
00:35:44.664 --> 00:35:48.537
And it's the first time
I'm alone since that night.

394
00:35:49.669 --> 00:35:52.193
And I just feel like
I'm going crazy.

395
00:35:53.629 --> 00:35:56.719
Everything is new
and I feel so out of place.

396
00:35:57.807 --> 00:36:01.115
New country. new house.
new goddamn alarm system

397
00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:03.683
that just seems to be
tormenting me.

398
00:36:03.726 --> 00:36:05.815
Big changes tend to bring up
these issues.

399
00:36:05.859 --> 00:36:08.166
There's a lot of stress
surrounding big events.

400
00:36:08.209 --> 00:36:11.256
and stress is a trigger.

401
00:36:11.299 --> 00:36:12.909
How about restarting
my meds again?

402
00:36:12.953 --> 00:36:14.433
We've worked too hard

403
00:36:14.476 --> 00:36:16.870
to move beyond
your dependence on medication.

404
00:36:16.913 --> 00:36:18.698
Our program is working.

405
00:36:18.741 --> 00:36:20.526
Stick to the plan.

406
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:23.355
Focus on a healthy lifestyle
to reduce stress.

407
00:36:23.398 --> 00:36:26.619
Healthy eating.
daily exercise. and sleep.

408
00:36:26.662 --> 00:36:30.884
Meditate. get a massage.

409
00:36:30.927 --> 00:36:34.322
-Unplug and relax.
-I know. but--

410
00:36:34.366 --> 00:36:38.457
Eva. the meds are only
a temporary band-aid.

411
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.242
We have our program
and it is working.

412
00:36:41.286 --> 00:36:44.680
Remember.
stress will increase paranoia

413
00:36:44.724 --> 00:36:47.161
and could lead
to hallucinations.

414
00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:49.032
It's a nasty feedback cycle.

415
00:36:49.076 --> 00:36:50.817
which means you need
to stay away

416
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.601
from triggers
to another episode.

417
00:36:52.645 --> 00:36:56.257
like alcohol or caffeine.

418
00:36:56.301 --> 00:37:00.479
staying up late.
or even watching scary movies.

419
00:37:00.522 --> 00:37:02.829
or seeing disturbing imagery.

420
00:37:02.872 --> 00:37:07.486
Accept that these things
are only happening
in your head.

421
00:37:07.529 --> 00:37:10.837
So no coffee or alcohol?

422
00:37:13.405 --> 00:37:15.450
It is possible. Eva.

423
00:37:18.497 --> 00:37:20.934
Well. thank you. Dr. Olivares.

424
00:37:20.977 --> 00:37:22.805
It's always a pleasure
to talk to you.

425
00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:25.634
Stay strong.

426
00:37:25.678 --> 00:37:28.681
And let's schedule a session
for later this week
to check in.

427
00:37:31.292 --> 00:37:32.337
Eva?

428
00:37:33.381 --> 00:37:36.036
Yes. Dr. Olivares.
That sounds great.

429
00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:37.690
Thank you. Goodbye.

430
00:37:54.924 --> 00:37:58.232
I was just calling
to say goodnight.

431
00:37:59.407 --> 00:38:04.238
I wanted to hear your voice
since we didn't get
to talk today.

432
00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:08.503
When you're on your way home.
just please don't eat dinner

433
00:38:08.547 --> 00:38:11.680
because I have
something exquisite planned.

434
00:38:12.202 --> 00:38:13.291
Okay.

435
00:38:13.987 --> 00:38:15.118
I love you.

436
00:38:15.815 --> 00:38:17.033
Good night.

437
00:38:19.775 --> 00:38:22.038
Lights out. Good night.

438
00:38:39.012 --> 00:38:41.406
Call silenced.

439
00:38:45.453 --> 00:38:47.063
Sorry I just missed you.

440
00:38:47.107 --> 00:38:49.849
I'm just at another
client dinner here. okay?

441
00:38:49.892 --> 00:38:53.679
Um. they need me here
for a couple more days.

442
00:38:53.722 --> 00:38:55.376
I'm so sorry. love.

443
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.510
I'm gonna make it up to you.
but it's just two more days.

444
00:38:58.553 --> 00:39:00.163
and then I'm home for good.

445
00:39:00.207 --> 00:39:02.731
Okay. I'm sorry.
I love you.

446
00:39:02.775 --> 00:39:04.820
I'll try you tomorrow. okay?

447
00:39:04.864 --> 00:39:06.561
All right. get some rest.

448
00:39:08.302 --> 00:39:10.043
Voicemail deleted.

449
00:39:25.928 --> 00:39:29.192

450
00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:52.868

00:39:54.304 --> 00:39:56.045
It's 6:00 in the morning.

452
00:39:56.089 --> 00:39:57.307
Time to rise and shine.

453
00:39:57.351 --> 00:39:59.048
Beat you to it today. Diablo.

454
00:40:18.067 --> 00:40:20.505
No. No! Shit!

455
00:40:20.548 --> 00:40:22.071
Shit!

456
00:40:25.597 --> 00:40:29.078

Miguel's welcome home dinner!

Yeah. whatever.
I get it.

473
00:41:29.443 --> 00:41:31.401
Something's burning.
I gotta go.

474

475

483
00:42:44.866 --> 00:42:46.259

Hello?

494
00:45:33.948 --> 00:45:35.080
Hello?

495
00:46:05.284 --> 00:46:06.372
Hello?

496
00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.800
Whoa! Whoa. whoa. it's okay.

497
00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:29.107
Hey. it's me.
It's me. Ray. the tech.

498
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:30.630
Ray. there's someone
in the house.

499
00:47:30.673 --> 00:47:32.937
There's no one in the house.
It was just a glitch.

500
00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.896
No. no. I-- I heard somebody
walking down the hall.

501
00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.506
The floors were creaking.

502
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:39.726
It's an old-ass house.
It creaks.

503
00:47:39.769 --> 00:47:41.902
I got an alert from
the third and second floor.

504
00:47:41.946 --> 00:47:43.817
Relax. just calm down.
all right?

505
00:47:43.861 --> 00:47:46.298
There's a system outage
in the neighborhood.

506
00:47:46.341 --> 00:47:47.734
Okay?

507
00:47:47.777 --> 00:47:49.344
That's why I'm out here
checking it.

508
00:47:49.388 --> 00:47:51.172
I'll come back in the morning
and reset it.

509
00:47:51.216 --> 00:47:53.696
But for now.
there's no one in the house.

510
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.872
It's okay.

511
00:47:56.743 --> 00:47:57.875
It's clear.

512
00:48:24.205 --> 00:48:26.120
Elevated heart rate.

513
00:48:29.776 --> 00:48:30.820
No!

517
00:49:28.966 --> 00:49:31.142
No. no!

518
00:50:11.356 --> 00:50:12.835
Hello. Me again.

519
00:50:15.142 --> 00:50:16.796
Last night
got pretty wild. huh?

520
00:50:16.839 --> 00:50:18.667
Can you just fix that. please?

521
00:50:19.755 --> 00:50:21.192
System reset.

522
00:50:21.235 --> 00:50:24.021
Everything is reset
after last night's alarm event.

523
00:50:24.064 --> 00:50:25.979
Is there anything else
you've been experiencing?

524
00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:27.241
You could say that.

525
00:50:27.285 --> 00:50:29.243
-That doesn't sound good.
-It's not good.

526
00:50:29.287 --> 00:50:32.464
I feel like that thing
is trying to harass me.

527
00:50:32.507 --> 00:50:35.510
Every time I set the alarm.
it locks the doors.

528
00:50:35.554 --> 00:50:37.817
I get "motion detected" alerts
all the time.

529
00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.340
even when there's nothing there.

530
00:50:39.384 --> 00:50:41.734
And now. whenever I look
at the security cam footage.

531
00:50:41.777 --> 00:50:44.476
there's always this glitchy
little figure of light
moving around.

532
00:50:44.519 --> 00:50:46.695
It sounds like
you're experiencing
some artifacting.

533
00:50:46.739 --> 00:50:49.655
I don't wanna experience
any more artifacting.

534
00:50:49.698 --> 00:50:52.005
Exactly. I don't know
too many of my clients
that would.

535
00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:54.051
-It's a little creepy.
-A little?

536
00:50:54.094 --> 00:50:57.097
So whenever you see
a young girl on screen.

537
00:50:57.141 --> 00:50:59.578
it's just remnants
in the system cache.

538
00:50:59.621 --> 00:51:03.408
It's not like some spooky spirit
trying to scare you. you know?

539
00:51:03.451 --> 00:51:05.758
I never said anything
about a young girl.

540
00:51:08.761 --> 00:51:11.633
No? You didn't-- you didn't
just say something about that?

541
00:51:11.677 --> 00:51:13.809
-No.
-You know what?

542
00:51:13.853 --> 00:51:16.638
It was-- it's the family
that used to live here before.

543
00:51:16.682 --> 00:51:19.815
They had a six-year-old girl
and that must be what it was.

544
00:51:19.859 --> 00:51:20.990
Okay.

545
00:51:21.034 --> 00:51:23.341
And did this previous family

546
00:51:23.384 --> 00:51:26.170
experience as many issues
as I'm having?

547
00:51:26.213 --> 00:51:28.955
You know. just minor nicks
here and there.

548
00:51:28.998 --> 00:51:31.653
You know. like you said.
the doors locking and...

549
00:51:31.697 --> 00:51:34.395
But after the system
got to know them.
everything was good.

550
00:51:35.396 --> 00:51:36.963
-Okay.
-Yeah.

551
00:51:37.006 --> 00:51:39.008
Cache cleared.
And boom.

552
00:51:39.052 --> 00:51:42.229
Just cleared the cache
and reset the system.
so everything should be fine.

553
00:51:42.273 --> 00:51:44.840
But feel free to call me
if you need anything.

554
00:51:44.884 --> 00:51:47.060
-Thank you.
-All right.

555
00:52:14.914 --> 00:52:17.873
Motion detected. hallway.

556
00:52:20.311 --> 00:52:22.835
Let's see if he fixed
this artifacting.

557
00:52:33.106 --> 00:52:35.152
Damn it. it's still there!

558
00:52:39.678 --> 00:52:41.767
Thank you
for calling Diablo Controls.

559
00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:43.725
Your call is important to us.

560
00:52:43.769 --> 00:52:46.119
The next agent will be
available in six minutes.

561
00:52:46.902 --> 00:52:48.774
This company's the worst.

562
00:52:56.825 --> 00:52:58.305
Come on.

563
00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:07.184
"Curious if anyone else

564
00:53:07.227 --> 00:53:10.709
has the Diablo Controls
security system?

565
00:53:10.752 --> 00:53:14.713
Have been having
some issues with mine."

566
00:53:19.979 --> 00:53:21.023
Whoa.

567
00:53:21.067 --> 00:53:22.938
Okay. that's odd.

568
00:53:55.667 --> 00:53:57.190
Please. be it.

569
00:53:57.234 --> 00:53:59.410
Please... be... it.

570
00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.326
Oh. yes!

571
00:54:02.369 --> 00:54:03.718
There you are!

572
00:54:03.762 --> 00:54:05.154
Thank you. thank you!

573
00:54:05.981 --> 00:54:08.984
Oh! Oh. no.

574
00:54:09.942 --> 00:54:11.509
I'm so sorry.

575
00:54:24.304 --> 00:54:25.914
System armed.

576
00:54:31.877 --> 00:54:33.270
Amen.

577
00:55:54.002 --> 00:55:56.657
System interference.

578
00:56:06.014 --> 00:56:07.494
System interference.

579
00:56:10.628 --> 00:56:12.107
System interference.

580
00:56:14.719 --> 00:56:17.025
All clear.

581
00:56:45.314 --> 00:56:46.533
Now what?

582
00:57:20.611 --> 00:57:21.829
Shit!

583
00:57:25.093 --> 00:57:26.268
Hello?

584
00:57:32.449 --> 00:57:34.755
Hello? Is someone there?

585
00:57:58.475 --> 00:58:00.172
Power restored.

586
00:58:54.835 --> 00:58:56.663
Amen.

587
00:59:34.048 --> 00:59:36.790
It's 6:00 in the morning.

588
00:59:36.834 --> 00:59:38.792
Time to rise and shine.

589
00:59:48.149 --> 00:59:51.152
So the hallucination
disappeared as soon
as the lights came back?

590
00:59:51.196 --> 00:59:55.287
Yes. but it was so much more
than just seeing him.

591
00:59:56.244 --> 00:59:57.681
I could smell him.

592
00:59:58.551 --> 01:00:01.989
I felt the air move
when he jumped out at me.

593
01:00:02.033 --> 01:00:06.211
Wow. Sounds like
a very vivid hallucination.

594
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:09.867
Have you been drinking?

595
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:11.782
No.

596
01:00:11.825 --> 01:00:15.437
But I was very hungover
from the night before.

597
01:00:16.438 --> 01:00:20.138
My husband was supposed
to come home and he didn't.

598
01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:23.228
so I was angry.

599
01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:25.012
I needed to blow off some steam.

600
01:00:25.056 --> 01:00:28.102
I understand.
but you need to be careful.

601
01:00:28.146 --> 01:00:31.497
You're in a fragile state
and could hurt yourself.

602
01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:35.109
I'm starting to rethink
our decision not to go
back on the meds.

603
01:00:35.153 --> 01:00:39.766
No. I. uh... I slept better
last night.

604
01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:41.420
I didn't have a nightmare.

605
01:00:42.769 --> 01:00:47.556
But you mentioned
hallucinations at our
last session.

606
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.125
and I wanted to let you know
that I had one.

607
01:00:51.169 --> 01:00:56.043
And I've never experienced
anything like that before.

608
01:00:56.087 --> 01:00:57.566
It was terrifying.

609
01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:59.830
You did the right thing
by calling.

610
01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:02.702
You're a warrior. Eva.

611
01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:05.618
You've been through
a lot and we've made
a ton of progress.

612
01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:09.013
I'm confident we're gonna
get you healthy again.

613
01:01:09.056 --> 01:01:11.842
Let's check in daily
until you're feeling better.

614
01:01:13.887 --> 01:01:15.410
Okay.

615
01:01:15.454 --> 01:01:17.064
Thank you.

616
01:01:17.108 --> 01:01:18.326
Bye.

617
01:01:30.425 --> 01:01:32.993
One new video message
from Neighbor Network.

618
01:01:37.563 --> 01:01:40.348
Hey. I have Diablo Controls.

619
01:01:40.392 --> 01:01:42.394
I've been having
a lot of issues.

620
01:01:42.437 --> 01:01:45.136
I feel like I'm going crazy.

621
01:01:45.179 --> 01:01:46.964
I don't wanna say
any more here.

622
01:01:47.878 --> 01:01:49.967
It's watching.

623
01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:52.230
I can tell you more
if you come to my house.

624
01:01:55.581 --> 01:01:57.888
I don't think so. serial killer.

625
01:02:10.335 --> 01:02:13.120
One new video message
from Neighbor Network.

626
01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:23.391
I realize my message
may have sounded creepy.

627
01:02:23.435 --> 01:02:26.612
We can talk on the sidewalk
in front of my house.

628
01:02:27.787 --> 01:02:29.746
Maybe there's still time
for you.

629
01:02:43.629 --> 01:02:45.326
System armed.

630
01:03:18.185 --> 01:03:19.883
I probably shouldn't have
contacted you.

631
01:03:19.926 --> 01:03:21.580
That was a mistake.
I'm sorry.

632
01:03:21.623 --> 01:03:23.538
No. it's okay.
I live a few blocks away.

633
01:03:23.582 --> 01:03:25.105
I was going for a walk anyway.

634
01:03:25.149 --> 01:03:28.065
That's not what I mean.
I-- I haven't slept in days.

635
01:03:28.108 --> 01:03:30.415
I don't know
what I'm doing anymore.

636
01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:32.721
-I-I can't talk to you.
-No. wait.

637
01:03:32.765 --> 01:03:35.028
You said you were having
some issues with your alarm.

638
01:03:35.072 --> 01:03:37.988
-What issues?
-Issues?

639
01:03:38.031 --> 01:03:41.469
Issues... yeah.
that's one way to describe it.

640
01:03:42.514 --> 01:03:43.907
It's tormenting me.

641
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.560
It's gonna hurt me. I know.

642
01:03:45.604 --> 01:03:48.650
-How can it hurt you?
-I can't say anything more.

643
01:03:50.565 --> 01:03:51.871
It's listening.

644
01:03:51.915 --> 01:03:54.613
Just leave and don't
go back to your house.

645
01:03:54.656 --> 01:03:57.050
Just leave and never go back.

646
01:03:57.094 --> 01:03:59.705
I don't understand.
Why don't you just leave?

647
01:03:59.748 --> 01:04:01.446
It's too late for me.

648
01:04:14.372 --> 01:04:16.330
Hey. how are you?

649
01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:18.898
How are you adjusting
to the neighborhood?

650
01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:20.726
-It's been an adjustment.
-It's a lot.

651
01:04:20.769 --> 01:04:24.034
New city. new house.
new country.

652
01:04:24.077 --> 01:04:25.557
Yeah. it's a lot.

653
01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.385
Are you planning
on having children?

654
01:04:27.428 --> 01:04:30.214
You know.
it's an awfully big house
for just the two of you.

655
01:04:30.257 --> 01:04:31.998
We've discussed it.

656
01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:33.695
The family who lived here
before you.

657
01:04:33.739 --> 01:04:36.133
they had one child.
a young daughter.

658
01:04:36.176 --> 01:04:39.745
And they were
planning on having more
when they disappeared.

659
01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:43.270
-Disappeared?
-The realtor didn't tell you?

660
01:04:43.314 --> 01:04:45.620
It was the darnedest thing.

661
01:04:45.664 --> 01:04:47.796
They were the nicest people.

662
01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.798
I knew them well. or...

663
01:04:49.842 --> 01:04:53.106
I thought that I did.
and then one day.
they were just gone.

664
01:04:54.368 --> 01:04:56.153
They even left
their stuff behind.

665
01:04:56.196 --> 01:04:57.806
What happened to them?

666
01:04:57.850 --> 01:04:59.896
Like I said. they disappeared.

667
01:04:59.939 --> 01:05:03.638
Poof. into thin air
without a trace.

668
01:05:03.682 --> 01:05:06.163
It was the darnedest thing.

669
01:05:06.206 --> 01:05:07.512
Excuse me.

670
01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:03.350
Oh. my God! It's Bob's house.

671
01:06:03.394 --> 01:06:05.700
I can't tell
if he's inside or not.

672
01:06:05.744 --> 01:06:07.224
Oh. my God.

673
01:06:07.267 --> 01:06:09.966
Bob? Please let us know
if you're okay.

674
01:06:56.273 --> 01:06:58.753
Initializing dream sequence.

675
01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:12.419
Sequencing El Diablo.

676
01:07:19.513 --> 01:07:22.299
Sequencing complete.

677
01:07:34.093 --> 01:07:39.185
I thought my paranoia
was getting worse.
but it's not.

678
01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:42.101
I'm not wrong.

679
01:07:44.103 --> 01:07:49.108
The things
I thought were happening
are really happening.

680
01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:52.764
Describe these things
that are really happening.

681
01:07:52.807 --> 01:07:55.245
It's the security system.

682
01:07:55.288 --> 01:07:57.508
It's causing it all.

683
01:07:57.551 --> 01:07:58.987
I'm sure of it.

684
01:07:59.031 --> 01:08:00.946
I researched it online.

685
01:08:00.989 --> 01:08:04.036
All of the reviews
were weirdly positive
except for one.

686
01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.169
And then yesterday.
my neighbor complained

687
01:08:06.212 --> 01:08:09.520
about his alarm system
and it's the same company
as mine.

688
01:08:09.563 --> 01:08:11.609
And I met him at his house.

689
01:08:11.652 --> 01:08:14.002
and within hours
of talking to me.

690
01:08:14.046 --> 01:08:16.788
his house caught on fire
and he died.

691
01:08:16.831 --> 01:08:18.877
Don't you see?

692
01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.532
Eva. I don't think
your alarm system
killed your neighbor.

693
01:08:21.575 --> 01:08:24.578
And it's possible
the alarm system received
positive reviews

694
01:08:24.622 --> 01:08:27.407
because people were
genuinely pleased with it.

695
01:08:27.451 --> 01:08:31.542
No. no! Wait.
please. Dr. Olivares.
you have to believe me.

696
01:08:31.585 --> 01:08:34.806
Before.
when I was seeing things
that weren't there. it's true.

697
01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:37.417
It was my imagination
and my PTSD.

698
01:08:37.461 --> 01:08:39.376
But I know the difference now.

699
01:08:39.419 --> 01:08:42.335
I will prescribe you
a refill of your medication.

700
01:08:42.379 --> 01:08:43.902
but only for a limited time.

701
01:08:43.945 --> 01:08:45.730
I want to keep you safe.

702
01:08:48.341 --> 01:08:50.343
And here's a thought.

703
01:08:50.387 --> 01:08:52.345
Why don't you just disable
your alarm?

704
01:08:52.389 --> 01:08:54.173
I don't know how.

705
01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:57.959
It's something we can explore.

706
01:08:58.917 --> 01:09:02.007
-There's a girl.
-A girl?

707
01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:06.446
Yes. And she lived
in this house before.

708
01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:10.146
Her and her family vanished.
but she's still here.

709
01:09:11.234 --> 01:09:15.107
They're trapped in
the alarm system.

710
01:09:18.197 --> 01:09:21.505
Trapped in the alarm system?

711
01:09:21.548 --> 01:09:24.638
-Have you been drinking again?
-A little. but...

712
01:09:26.727 --> 01:09:28.816
Email my assistant
the pharmacy information.

713
01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.775
I'll have the prescription
prepared.

714
01:09:31.558 --> 01:09:32.603
Okay.

715
01:09:34.996 --> 01:09:37.564
-Dr. Olivares...
-Yes.

716
01:09:37.608 --> 01:09:39.262
If something happens to me...

717
01:09:40.263 --> 01:09:43.788
please tell my husband
what I told you.

718
01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:46.138
Nothing is going
to happen to you.

719
01:09:53.406 --> 01:09:56.453
Why don't you believe me?

720
01:10:00.065 --> 01:10:03.242
Please continue to hold
for the next available
pharmacist.

721
01:10:13.339 --> 01:10:16.212
Please continue to hold

pharmacist.

722
01:10:18.475 --> 01:10:21.260
One new video message
from Neighbor Network.

723
01:10:27.092 --> 01:10:30.617
He found me.

724
01:10:30.661 --> 01:10:33.577
Please continue to hold
for the next available
pharmacist.

725
01:10:37.842 --> 01:10:39.844
Eva.mi amor. are you there?

726
01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:42.281
Hi.

727
01:10:45.632 --> 01:10:47.678
Nothing. I'm just tired.

728
01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:50.420
Yeah.
Well. I've got good news.

729
01:10:50.463 --> 01:10:53.074
Two pieces of good news.
actually.

730
01:10:53.118 --> 01:10:56.904
We just closed the deal. baby.
Yeah!

731
01:10:56.948 --> 01:10:58.819
And I'll be home
tomorrow morning.

732
01:10:58.863 --> 01:11:00.778
I'm so excited to see you.

733
01:11:01.692 --> 01:11:03.694
You don't sound excited.

734
01:11:03.737 --> 01:11:06.349
Sorry.
I'm just distracted.

735
01:11:07.393 --> 01:11:08.960
That's wonderful.

736
01:11:09.003 --> 01:11:10.831
What's the other piece
of good news?

737
01:11:10.875 --> 01:11:12.920
Well. they got him.

738
01:11:12.964 --> 01:11:14.313
They got El Diablo.

739
01:11:14.357 --> 01:11:16.315
You never have to worry
about him again.

740
01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:18.448
What-- what do you mean?

741
01:11:18.491 --> 01:11:20.363
Well. he's dead.

742
01:11:20.406 --> 01:11:21.973
That's not possible.

743
01:11:22.016 --> 01:11:23.540
When? Where?

744
01:11:23.583 --> 01:11:26.151
Here in Mexico City. sweetie.

745
01:11:26.194 --> 01:11:28.414
The police found him
and got into a shootout
with him.

746
01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:29.720
It happened last week.

747
01:11:29.763 --> 01:11:31.374
It came out
in the newspapers today.

748
01:11:31.417 --> 01:11:33.201
All right?
I texted you the article.

749
01:11:33.245 --> 01:11:36.030
You never have to worry
about him again. okay?

750
01:11:36.074 --> 01:11:38.076
It's behind us now.

751
01:11:38.119 --> 01:11:39.730
-I have to go.
-No. no--

752
01:11:42.602 --> 01:11:43.734
Where is it?

753
01:11:44.735 --> 01:11:46.040
