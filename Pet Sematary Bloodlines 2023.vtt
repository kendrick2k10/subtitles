179
00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.413
I can't.
You can't?

180
00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:21.480
I don't--
Oh. yeah?

181
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.150
Just enjoy every second

182
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.318

out of Ludlow!

Jesus. Norma. you okay?
You okay?

186
00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:33.826
Honey.

187
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.362
Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay.

188
00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.397
It flew out of nowhere.
I didn't see it.

189
00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:40.433
The hell?

190
00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:42.935
Is that
the Batermans' dog?
What?

191
00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:46.172
Jud. did you hit him?

192
00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:47.740
Oh. no. No. no.

[dog whines]

196
00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:03.456
He sounds like
he's sick or something.

[growls]

198
00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:06.992
Maybe we should
give him some space. Jud.

199
00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:10.362
Let's just walk him back.
We're not that far.

200
00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:13.866
Come on. Hendrix.
Come on. buddy.

201
00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:16.669

["Love Without Sound" playing]

203
00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:26.345
What the hell's all this?

204
00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:27.746
Can't hear
the customer's racism

205
00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:29.949
over whatever
the hell this is.

206
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:32.151

It's moon music. bro.

[record scratches. stops]
White Noise.
"Love Without Sound."

208
00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:35.888
Yeah. I'd love
if I couldn't hear it.

209
00:12:35.888 --> 00:12:38.624
[chuckles]
Well. it's better than
the depressing acoustic

210
00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:39.825
you listen to.

211
00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:41.127
[Manny] It's different.

212
00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:44.230
[scoffs]
Been dreaming them all week.

213
00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:46.832
My pillow is my muse.

214
00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:48.167
You all right. Donna?

215
00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:50.636
I don't really know
what they mean yet.

216
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:55.641
See. old Norse shamans
and warriors used animal masks

217
00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:57.109
to channel their spirits.

218
00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:02.047
Do I look more like
a warrior or a healer?

219
00:13:02.047 --> 00:13:05.151
More like a freak.

Yeah.

225

Peace Corps.
Big deal. So what?

226
00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:38.951
Well. don't you think
it's about time

227
00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:40.486
you got outta here too. man?

228
00:13:45.724 --> 00:13:47.660
Nice dream.
I'm serious.

229
00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:51.330
I submitted a piece
to a gallery in Buffalo.

230
00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:54.900
They want me to do a show.

you're leaving now too?

I want you to come with me.

234
00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:05.277
So I can tag along

235
00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:07.880
and hide in the corner
of your fancy shows

236
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.114
like I already do
at your parties?

237
00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:10.182
I mean. shit. Donna.

There's something
wrong with him.

255
00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:58.157
Just get him home.

Where's the dog?

00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:56.281

264
00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:57.583

back to the porch.

as quick as we can. okay?

Yeah.

trying to join the Peace Corps.

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:15.300
Yeah. We're actually
on our way out now.
[Timmy] Yeah.

271
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.402
Hey.

272
00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:20.606
You think you would have lasted
one day in real combat?

273
00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:26.478
Because I think that
you'd piss yourself so bad

274
00:17:26.478 --> 00:17:28.981
that you'd
set off a minefield.

275
00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.449
And that you're lucky

276
00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:32.818
that old Dan Crandall
paid off that doc

277
00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:33.986
to keep you out the war.

278
00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:36.622
Yeah. Yeah.

279
00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:37.823
No war for Jud.

280
00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:40.459
There's no war
for Jud Crandall.

281
00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:41.827
I think that's a lie. Timmy.

282
00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:43.562
[Timmy]
I'm lying? Look at me. Yeah.

283
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.766
Well. only children
tell the whole truth.
but I'm not lying.

284
00:17:47.766 --> 00:17:49.268
I'm not.

285
00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:55.474
[Jud] Okay.

286
00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:57.443
Really glad you're back
in one piece. Timmy.

287
00:17:57.443 --> 00:17:59.178
and it was really good
to see you.

288
00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:07.719
I think
we're gonna be going now.

289
00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:09.321
You take care of yourself.

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:48.627
It's okay. That's it.

306
00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:50.229
We're gonna go to
the hospital. okay?

307
00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:51.530
Come here. put your head up.

317
00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:35.440
I am sore. Yeah.

318
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.876
Doctor said this could've
been a lot worse.

319
00:19:38.777 --> 00:19:41.179
But he wants to keep you here
for a few nights.

320
00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:45.317
Okay.
Then we'll get to Michigan.

321
00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:47.386
Then the world.

322
00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:53.425
Jud. this wasn't your fault.

323
00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:01.867
I'm gonna let you rest. Okay.

324
00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:05.571
I'll be back tomorrow.

Sorry.
Fucking hey. man.

Bird-watching incident.

329
00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:28.794
Hey. uh. Manny.

330
00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:32.497
Can we go somewhere
and-- and talk?

331
00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:35.867
What.
you trying to ask me out?

332
00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:37.269
Come on. out with it.

333
00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:42.808
You're avoiding me.

334
00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:48.614
I'm just--
I'm just trying to...

335
00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:51.316
What. say goodbye?

336
00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:53.685
[scoffs] Is that it?

337
00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:55.354
What's the point? Bye.

338
00:20:55.354 --> 00:20:56.922
All right.
have fun with Norma.

339
00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:04.363
Well. actually.
we're not going yet.

340
00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:10.202
Norma got attacked
by Timmy's dog.

341
00:21:10.202 --> 00:21:12.738
Shit. Is she okay?

342
00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:13.939
Mm-hmm.

343
00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:17.709
I think.

344
00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:22.381
Timmy just watched.

345
00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:27.419
Like he was looking
right through it. Like--

346
00:21:28.553 --> 00:21:30.756
Like he wasn't there
or something.

347
00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:33.625
You know. Donna saw him.

348
00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:37.929
He was just
mumbling to himself.

349
00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:40.732
like. a bunch of names.

350
00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:45.804
And he just passed her by.
like she wasn't even there.

351
00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:47.906
[lighter clicks]

352
00:21:49.775 --> 00:21:51.543
I think something's wrong.

353
00:21:52.377 --> 00:21:54.579
He probably killed people
in 'Nam.

354
00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:56.581
[scoffs] It's like.
what do you expect?

355
00:21:56.581 --> 00:21:58.850
The same kid that
we used to sneak beers with

356
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:59.951
in your tree house.

357
00:22:10.395 --> 00:22:11.630
