00:00:24.083 --> 00:00:26.833
[commentator 1] <i>Rebound for Allen.
That was a crucial grab in the third--</i>

5
00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:29.042
[commentator 2] <i>Simple rule.
Get the ball to Kamal.</i>

6
00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:31.500
[commentator 3] <i>This kid's playing
better than Kobe played in high school.</i>

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.792
[commentator 4] <i>Allen's flying
down the court for the three. It's good!</i>

8
00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:35.167

10
00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:40.792
[commentator 7] <i>He's a very talented
young player already.</i>

11
00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:43.167
In case you're not familiar

12
00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:44.833
allow me to make the introduction.

13
00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:46.750
I'm here with senior phenom Kamal Allen.

14
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.917
Many consider him to be
the top prospect in the country.

15
00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:52.875
<i>Averaging a double-double
with 26 points per game</i>

16
00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:57.083
<i>and coming off his second consecutive
California state championship.</i>

00:00:57.083 --> 00:01:00.000
<i>Along with him is his dad.
the equally famous.</i>

18
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.500
if not infamous. father. Benji Allen.

19
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.208
Great to have you guys on the program.

20
00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:06.375
Thanks. Stan. Great to be here.

21
00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:09.833
And great to be introducing the world
to the next GOAT. Kamal Allen.

22
00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:12.292
- Time to put his name in the mix.
- Thanks for having us.

23
00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:15.500
There's been talk about your father's
involvement in your career.

24
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.292
It seems he's always been there for you.

25
00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:19.042
Man. Yes. sir.

26
00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:21.167
Through thick and thin.

27
00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:23.500
- Hey. that's what fathers do.
- Man.

28
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.375
I'm always going to be there
no matter what.

29
00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:29.083
Have you guys discussed how you're gonna
handle those long NBA seasons?

30
00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:32.625
Well. you know. I haven't missed a game
his whole life. I don't plan to start now.

31
00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.625
Especially if he's covering my airfare.

32
00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:38.042
All right. So I made a bet with your dad

33
00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:40.000
that you couldn't hit this shot
sitting down.

34
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.625
So let's see here. Mr. Number One Recruit.

35
00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:44.500
You gonna prove me wrong here.
young fella?

36
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.958
- He done stepped in it now.
- I guess so.

37
00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.000
Come on. come on.
Show him how we do what we do.

38
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.625
Let's see what you got.

39
00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:51.792
[sighs]

40
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.125
[Stan Verrett] Stay tuned.
we'll be right back.

41
00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:58.708
[player laughs]

42
00:01:58.708 --> 00:02:02.000
Yo. bro. that's your mans?
That boy's washed.

43
00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:05.958
Let's go. Game point. dog.

44
00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.292
You gonna let him disrespect you?

45
00:02:08.083 --> 00:02:09.292
Come on. Black man.

46
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.208
Come on. Shit.

47
00:02:12.708 --> 00:02:14.708
- [player] All right. Guard him.
- [friend] Come on.

48
00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:17.667
Do it. Whoo!

49
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.458
[Kamal] Don't you ever disrespect me.

50
00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:24.583
- It's game.
- It's win by two.

51
00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:26.000
Not here it's not.

52
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.833
Dude be cheating. dog.

53
00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:32.208
Nah. you just weak. son.
It's all right though. Next time. man.

54
00:02:32.792 --> 00:02:34.125
Next time. papi!

55
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.875
Bro. that move was cool and all.

56
00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:37.792
but I know you seen me wide open
in the corner. right?

57
00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:39.792
Yeah. I saw you.
I was just focused on winning.

58
00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:42.417
We trying to get ready for this
two-on-two tournament we got coming up.

59
00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:43.792
- You fucking that up.
- [scoffs]

60
00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:45.625
Y'all practicing
for a two-on-two tournament?

61
00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:47.333
Nigga. hell yes. What you mean?

62
00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.417
Look. grand prize is 25G

63
00:02:49.417 --> 00:02:52.417
plus free entry
into that big-ass tournament in Leimert

64
00:02:52.417 --> 00:02:53.708
where the winner gets 500.000.

65
00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:54.792
Come on.

66
00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:57.208
Hey. shit. every hooper I know
is entering that motherfucker.

67
00:02:57.208 --> 00:02:58.917
And if we win a half milli.

68
00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:01.250
maybe Speedy can stop fucking
with these chubby-ass white women

69
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.625
that buy him general-release Jordans.

70
00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:05.917
Yeah. whatever. nigga. I like Mildred.
She cool.

71
00:03:06.417 --> 00:03:09.750
All right. look. I love y'all. man.
But what are we. 12?

72
00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:12.083
I ain't playing
in no two-on-two tournament.

73
00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:13.792
Rude.

74
00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:16.750
So we're at his old high school
playing pickup basketball.

75
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.417
but he too good
for the two-on-two tournament?

76
00:03:18.417 --> 00:03:20.625
Tsk. tsk on this nigga.

77
00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:21.750
A damn shame.

78
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.667
Being able to windmill dunk while working
a minimum wage job and smoking no weed.

79
00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:29.500
That sound like jail. Couldn't be me.

80
00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:33.375
Hey. they letting yoga instructors
in the gym now?

81
00:03:34.417 --> 00:03:37.750
Look. just. uh. stretch out.
play with the oversized ball.

82
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.125
Are you kidding me?

83
00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:42.875
Columbus must think he found
some new shit. huh? We been here though.

84
00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:45.667
We should rob him. Send a message.

85
00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:46.875
I am down for that.

86
00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:49.667
Why would we... [grunts] No.

87
00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:51.917
I was testing you.

88
00:03:51.917 --> 00:03:53.292
Fucking stupid.

89
00:03:53.292 --> 00:03:54.375
You guys got next?

90
00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:58.292
Depend on who asking.
If you asking. yeah. we got next.

91
00:03:58.292 --> 00:04:00.458
And then after that it could be you

92
00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:03.500
and ol' boy who mama look like
she gave up on Black men.

93
00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:07.000
Well. I would never give up on you guys.

94
00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:09.667
Is that a colonic water?

95
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.625
No. it's. um--
It's actually my 30-day detox program.

96
00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:15.000
You guys wanna try a free sample?

97
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.750
Uh. nah.
I ain't drinking no boo-boo juice.

98
00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:20.208
All right. fellas.

99
00:04:23.042 --> 00:04:24.333
Just to send a message though.

100
00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:26.333
Mm-hmm. I'm thinking about it.

101
00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:31.500
- What the fuck is the point of the ball?
- Stretch out. Just fucking stretch.

102
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
One.

103
00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:37.083
Two.

104
00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:40.833
Eyes up. eyes up.

105
00:04:42.417 --> 00:04:43.875
Finish. finish. finish.

106
00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:46.458
All right.

107
00:04:50.583 --> 00:04:52.167
How many subscribers you think you up to?

108
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.042
I don't know. Thousand. give or take.

109
00:04:55.042 --> 00:04:57.208
[scoffs] Give or take what? A thousand?

110
00:04:57.208 --> 00:04:58.292
[chuckles]

111
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.375
Ball.

112
00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:03.542
Ball.

113
00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:07.417
Hey. man. I-- I just noticed you're not
getting enough legs underneath your shot.

114
00:05:07.417 --> 00:05:08.500
Are you dehydrated?

115
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.958
Because my detox program
could really take care of that for you.

116
00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.167
What the fuck?

117
00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:15.375
Bro. give me the ball back and stop using
that young Black kid for clout.

118
00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:16.583
Give me the fucking ball.

119
00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:21.875
You know. I just feel like you could use
some of the attention

120
00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:24.792
that your athleticism attracts
to get your teammates involved.

121
00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:27.958
Instead of taking these shots
that are a little out of your range.

122
00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:32.958
Out of my range?

123
00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:35.542
[friend] Come on. bro. Don't do this shit.

124
00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:38.625
Pick a spot. bro.

125
00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:41.583
Hundred bucks you can't make
more shots than me. Best out of five.

126
00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:45.833
Look. obvious that you're
an amazing pickup hoops guy. you know?

127
00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:47.292
I could tell you have a lot of passion.

128
00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:50.125
You got the tattoo of a basketball
with the crown on it. I get it.

129
00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.333
But let's not do this. man.
I don't want to take your money.

130
00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.250
200.

131
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.542
Let's just do 300.

132
00:05:57.583 --> 00:05:59.333
[chuckles] It's not my dad's money.

133
00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:01.542
Just fuck me. huh?

134
00:06:04.375 --> 00:06:05.625
[influencer] Right there's good.

135
00:06:09.458 --> 00:06:10.458
[Kamal] That's one.

136
00:06:16.792 --> 00:06:17.792
Two.

137
00:06:20.458 --> 00:06:22.708
It's been my spot
since I was 14. gentrifier.

138
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.375
Next time look at the wall. Yeah.

139
00:06:28.417 --> 00:06:29.458
That's three.

140
00:06:32.583 --> 00:06:35.417
Hold on. you're Kamal Allen.

141
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.417
Didn't you get arrested your senior year?

142
00:06:39.792 --> 00:06:41.750
- [spectators clapping rhythmically]
- Overrated!

143
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.833
- Hey. Kamal. you fucking suck!
- Overrated!

144
00:06:48.417 --> 00:06:49.458
Hey. come on. Kamal!

145
00:06:50.292 --> 00:06:52.167
[players gasp. murmur]

146
00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:54.250
Was that guy just a random fan?

147
00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:57.208
Now where'd you end up playing in college?

148
00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:05.167
[players murmur]

149
00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:08.625
[influencer] Three for five.
Not bad. my brother.

150
00:07:08.625 --> 00:07:11.500
Hope you can shoot. Sherman Oaks.

151
00:07:12.458 --> 00:07:15.333
I grew up in Beverly Hills actually.
Not the super nice part.

152
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.167
Yeah. you know. sometimes I like
to practice shooting off the dribble

153
00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:23.292
'cause it's rare you can catch a shoot
with all these wannabe Hardens out here.

154
00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:26.625
- [players gasp]
- [influencer] One.

155
00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:29.458
You get it. You're a Harden.

156
00:07:30.042 --> 00:07:31.125
No offense.

157
00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:34.708
That's two.

158
00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:36.667
You thought I couldn't hang. I get it.

159
00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:38.792
But a shoot-out?

160
00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:43.125
- Three.
- [players laugh]

161
00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:45.958
I mean. don't you guys assume
all white dudes can do is shoot?

162
00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:48.917
[sighs]

163
00:07:48.917 --> 00:07:51.292
You know.
there's this old quote that says.

164
00:07:51.292 --> 00:07:54.542
"Under pressure.
you don't rise to the occasion.

165
00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:57.208
You sink to the level of your training."

166
00:07:58.708 --> 00:07:59.917
And...

167
00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:01.125
that's four.

168
00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:02.333
[player] Wow.

169
00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:06.417
So. I prefer Venmo or Zelle.

170
00:08:06.417 --> 00:08:09.250
but you seem like a Cash App guy.
so that's fine.

00:16:15.917 --> 00:16:17.917
[music continues]

341
00:16:32.833 --> 00:16:34.375
[no audible dialogue]

342
00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.375
[chuckling] Go away.

343
00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:42.542
I will.

344
00:16:50.833 --> 00:16:52.375
[music fades]

345
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.792
[partner] I found this salad dressing.

346
00:16:55.792 --> 00:16:59.500
You are going to love it. Okay?
I'll just go whip it up.

347
00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:04.458
[grunts]
Or we could go out to dinner tonight?

348
00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:06.792
We're supposed to be saving money. remember?

349
00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:09.375
[Jeremy] Yeah.
but you've been working so hard.

350
00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:13.208
[exhales] And I got a few new clients.
and I wanna celebrate.

351
00:17:14.042 --> 00:17:15.958
- One night.
- New clients?

352
00:17:16.458 --> 00:17:17.625
- Yeah.
- Who?

353
00:17:18.458 --> 00:17:22.000
Babe. Let's go to dinner. Come on.

354
00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:25.208
[partner] What about soba noodles?
That sounds good.

355
00:17:25.208 --> 00:17:27.625
- [Jeremy] No.
- Uh. avocado toast?

356
00:17:27.625 --> 00:17:29.125
- That's easy--
- No. No.

357
00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:33.000
[sighs] You're the only vegan I know
who can't eat in a vegan restaurant.

358
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.292
It's 'cause
half these veggies are hybrids.

359
00:17:35.292 --> 00:17:36.292
[partner] Mmm.

360
00:17:36.292 --> 00:17:38.583
Did I ever tell you just

361
00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:42.000
how much it turns me on
when you talk shit about vegetables?

362
00:17:42.667 --> 00:17:44.958
[both chuckle]

363
00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.042
Joke all you want.

364
00:17:46.042 --> 00:17:48.958
but when I get these stem cells
and start hooping like I'm 19 again.

365
00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:50.375
I'll be the one laughin'.

366
00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:52.792
Stem cells.
Wh-- What are you talking about?

367
00:17:52.792 --> 00:17:53.917
Regenerative medicine.

368
00:17:53.917 --> 00:17:55.458
It can heal my ACLs.

369
00:17:55.458 --> 00:17:56.875
Rich people are obsessed with it.

370
00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.958
Rich people? You have an EBT card.

371
00:17:59.708 --> 00:18:01.083
We have an EBT card.

372
00:18:01.083 --> 00:18:03.167
You promised me you were done
trying to play ball.

373
00:18:03.167 --> 00:18:05.875
- Done with the painkillers. the surgery--
- We're ready.

374
00:18:05.875 --> 00:18:08.500
We need a minute.
What the fuck do you need stem cells for?

375
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.292
Do you have an awful disease
that I don't know about.

376
00:18:11.292 --> 00:18:14.000
or is this about you trying
to play basketball? Again.

377
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.042
What if I just want my body to get
healthier instead of breaking down?

378
00:18:17.042 --> 00:18:20.750
[scoffs] Look. I want to try and plan for
the future in a realistic way with you.

379
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.250
but it's really hard to do that
when we're always worried about money

380
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.042
because you're out here
living in a fantasy.

381
00:18:25.042 --> 00:18:27.958
Oh. my God. [sighs]

382
00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.292
Look. I'm just working with my clients.

383
00:18:30.292 --> 00:18:31.833
I'm done with the pills.

384
00:18:31.833 --> 00:18:33.542
I'm not gonna do anything irresponsible.

385
00:18:33.542 --> 00:18:34.917
I got you.

386
00:18:37.417 --> 00:18:41.667
I just can't help but wonder if you'd
be happier moving on from basketball

387
00:18:41.667 --> 00:18:43.875
and finding something
that actually loves you back.

388
00:18:43.875 --> 00:18:45.250
What. like porn?

389
00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:47.792
[server sighs]

390
00:18:48.792 --> 00:18:50.208
- My bad.
- Mm-hmm.

391
00:18:53.875 --> 00:18:56.500
God damn! Got them thighs out.

392
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.458
Out here looking like
Mailman Thee Stallion.

393
00:18:58.458 --> 00:19:00.792
Yeah. whatever. Y'all got jokes. huh?

394
00:19:00.792 --> 00:19:02.958
- [chuckles]
- What. y'all didn't get picked? [chuckles]

395
00:19:04.708 --> 00:19:07.125
[sighs] Y'all still trying to play in
that two-on-two tournament?

396
00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:08.500
With the 25K prize?

397
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.500
We already signed up with my brother.

398
00:19:11.208 --> 00:19:12.583
Didn't he go to jail for trafficking?

399
00:19:12.583 --> 00:19:14.292
That was wanton endangerment.

400
00:19:14.292 --> 00:19:16.875
And that was my brother Keon.
We playing with Lamont.

401
00:19:16.875 --> 00:19:19.917
Yeah. Lamont used to sell pit bulls
in front of that Krispy Kreme on King.

402
00:19:19.917 --> 00:19:21.000
[Speedy] That he did.

403
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.750
Then just tell him that
you playing with me now.

404
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.625
I would do that.
but he already paid the fee.

405
00:19:24.625 --> 00:19:26.917
He got that 2.500 like it wasn't anything.

406
00:19:26.917 --> 00:19:29.583
[Speedy] No. he says he's trying to
spend more quality time with me.

407
00:19:29.583 --> 00:19:30.708
It's kind of nice actually.

408
00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:32.583
Plus I thought you gonna
never play in a tournament.

409
00:19:32.583 --> 00:19:34.000
What did he say? He was like.

410
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.542
"My name's Kamal.
I don't play no basketball tournament.

411
00:19:37.542 --> 00:19:39.500
Only time I play is
if I get paid in the NBA."

412
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.375
[Speedy]
"I'm on the baseline. Windmill dunk."

413
00:19:41.375 --> 00:19:43.708
- "My name's Kamal. Give me the ball."
- " <i>Slamma Jamma</i>. Kamal."

414
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.083
Look. Bobby cut my shifts.

415
00:19:46.583 --> 00:19:47.917
Want me to cut his brakes?

416
00:19:49.208 --> 00:19:50.583
Bro. what the fuck is wrong with you?

417
00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:52.917
I could make that call.
He know you got a family to feed?

418
00:19:54.583 --> 00:19:55.833
What. you gonna throw a chip at him?

419
00:19:55.833 --> 00:19:57.583
- I'll chip his ass. All right now.
- Bro.

420
00:19:57.583 --> 00:19:58.667
Whatever. man.

421
00:19:58.667 --> 00:20:01.208
I just need a human being who can play
so I can make some money.

422
00:20:01.208 --> 00:20:03.542
Now watch. Watch how I ran pick and roll.

423
00:20:03.542 --> 00:20:05.542
Always kept defenders on my hip.

424
00:20:05.542 --> 00:20:10.167
Way before Trae. way before Ja Morant.
I was ahead of my time. For real.

425
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.167
I feel like Steve Nash and Chris Paul
did that for years.

426
00:20:14.583 --> 00:20:17.667
[sighs]
You're so negative for your age. bro.

427
00:20:18.375 --> 00:20:19.375
Whoa.

428
00:20:19.375 --> 00:20:23.042
Nah. Phil Williamson is
training players here? [chuckles]

429
00:20:23.833 --> 00:20:24.833
Oh. He's super lit.

430
00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:27.167
He's got his own sponsorships.
he went to Duke.

431
00:20:27.167 --> 00:20:29.583
- He even got his own player on <i>2K</i>.
- I know who Phil Williamson is.

432
00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:32.542
Then you know it's a big deal
he in this weak-ass gym. right?

433
00:20:32.542 --> 00:20:34.708
Why are you trying so hard
to agitate me today. bro?

434
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.667
I'm just saying. You know?

435
00:20:38.083 --> 00:20:39.083
The fuck is this?

436
00:20:39.083 --> 00:20:41.250
Oh. Phil. he booked the court for the day.

437
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.583
And he paid in money.

438
00:20:42.583 --> 00:20:45.375
Not morale or whatever the fuck
you was talking about.

439
00:20:45.375 --> 00:20:47.000
- Hey. yo. what's up. Mooch? You good?
- Phil.

440
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.958
- Yes. thanks. man.
- All right. yeah.

441
00:20:48.958 --> 00:20:50.375
Phil Williamson.

442
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:52.208
You just name-drop yourself?

443
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.542
Jacoby Grant. right?

444
00:20:55.542 --> 00:20:56.625
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

445
00:20:56.625 --> 00:20:58.500
Played AAU with Malachi.

446
00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.750
- For sure.
- Hey. yo. Malachi.

447
00:21:00.458 --> 00:21:02.625
Uh. nice to meet you too. Mr. Phil.
Big fan of yours.

448
00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:03.583
- [Phil] Thanks.
- Yeah.

449
00:21:03.583 --> 00:21:06.167
Yeah. they say Malachi might be
the number one pick next year.

450
00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:09.333
- What's up. bro. That's hard.
- Yeah. Yeah. it's good for business too.

451
00:21:09.333 --> 00:21:10.958
Just signed a lease on a Tesla.

452
00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:13.042
Got invited to The Hype House.

453
00:21:13.042 --> 00:21:15.875
My IG's been popping off. bro.

454
00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:18.417
I mean. I got a lot of haters
in the comment section.

455
00:21:18.417 --> 00:21:20.167
but I think it's mostly just white hoopers

456
00:21:20.167 --> 00:21:22.083
who hate to see another white hooper
find his lane.

457
00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:23.042
You feel me?

458
00:21:23.042 --> 00:21:24.792
We don't talk enough about that. bro.

459
00:21:24.792 --> 00:21:27.583
White on white crime. like.
that's just a disease. man.

460
00:21:27.583 --> 00:21:29.042
- Amen.
- [Phil] Yeah.

461
00:21:29.042 --> 00:21:30.250
You a trainer?

462
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.292
- [scoffs] Hell nah.
- Play you for the court.

463
00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:35.458
Two-on-two.
Big dogs versus regular-sized dogs.

464
00:21:35.458 --> 00:21:38.000
[chuckles] Yo. you joking. right?

465
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.792
["Who That Is" playing]

466
00:21:39.792 --> 00:21:41.125
You wanna put some money on it?

467
00:21:43.167 --> 00:21:44.167
All right.

468
00:21:53.458 --> 00:21:54.625
[Jacoby grunts] Come on. Jump.

469
00:21:55.458 --> 00:21:56.542
Hey. watch-- Pick. pick!

[beeping continues]

474
00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:08.042
Two minutes. two minutes.
I'm coming right back.

475
00:22:08.042 --> 00:22:09.417
[Jacoby] What? Jeremy!

476
00:22:09.417 --> 00:22:11.208
- [beeping stops]
- Yo. where's he going?

00:22:15.458 --> 00:22:16.792

478
00:22:23.167 --> 00:22:24.167

It's fine. Check it up.

Come on.

You know what to do.

- [bone crunching]

Fuck!

488
00:23:01.542 --> 00:23:03.625
[Kamal] You just gonna let him
have the court like that?

489
00:23:03.625 --> 00:23:06.958
The fuck? I think I proved my point.

490
00:23:07.708 --> 00:23:09.083
- Do you?
- Yeah.

491
00:23:09.792 --> 00:23:10.792
How's the knee?

492
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.583
Dude. what do you want?

[sighs]

494
00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:16.958
You stalking me?

495
00:23:16.958 --> 00:23:18.542
[Kamal] It's called Google. bro.

496
00:23:18.542 --> 00:23:20.292
You think you fucking slick. huh?

497
00:23:20.292 --> 00:23:22.000
Showing up to courts
dressed like a dumbass.

498
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.208
acting like you can't hoop when. really.
you played at Gonzaga.

499
00:23:25.208 --> 00:23:28.000
Now see. you assumed I couldn't hoop
because I'm white.

500
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.417
- which is incredibly outdated. by the way.
- No. I assumed you couldn't hoop

501
00:23:30.417 --> 00:23:32.917
'cause you walk around
with testicles around your neck. bro.

502
00:23:32.917 --> 00:23:35.958
What up. J! Hey. man.
can we talk about that tab later?

503
00:23:35.958 --> 00:23:37.250
I got you next time. Teej.

504
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.292
I know you do. twin.
All right. keep pushin' P.

505
00:23:46.833 --> 00:23:47.958
Look. bro. I came to see

506
00:23:47.958 --> 00:23:50.375
if you wanted to play in a two-on-two
this weekend at Venice Beach.

507
00:23:50.375 --> 00:23:53.583
We can hustle a few games together to get
the money for the entry fee. all right?

508
00:23:53.583 --> 00:23:55.375
You're joking. right?

509
00:23:55.375 --> 00:23:57.958
Dude. there's a million leagues
I can play in right now.

510
00:23:58.625 --> 00:24:00.208
Tons of opportunities to get scouted.

511
00:24:00.208 --> 00:24:01.583
I'm straight.

512
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.000
You seriously
still trying to play pro ball?

513
00:24:05.375 --> 00:24:07.208
I mean. maybe not the G League but...

514
00:24:07.917 --> 00:24:08.917
Wow.

515
00:24:08.917 --> 00:24:10.750
[Jeremy] What?
What. you don't think I'm good enough?

516
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.250
Nah. you just make so much more sense now.

517
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.583
Yeah? You don't make any sense.

518
00:24:14.583 --> 00:24:16.792
No injuries. You're in good shape.

519
00:24:17.417 --> 00:24:18.875
Why are you still playing pickup?

520
00:24:18.875 --> 00:24:21.708
I'm not one of your poor little Black boys
looking for a father figure. all right?

521
00:24:21.708 --> 00:24:24.458
Don't need a coach. don't need a mentor.

522
00:24:24.458 --> 00:24:25.792
and I damn sure don't need a friend.

523
00:24:25.792 --> 00:24:28.958
What I need is for you to show up on time.
stand in a corner and hit some open shots.

524
00:24:28.958 --> 00:24:31.042
Maybe play a little bit of defense.
That's it.

525
00:24:31.042 --> 00:24:33.875
Wow. Lot to unpack there.

526
00:24:33.875 --> 00:24:36.500
[scoffs] I mean. fuck.
How can I say no to that?

527
00:24:40.792 --> 00:24:42.208
Bro. What?

528
00:24:43.125 --> 00:24:44.125
What the fuck?

529
00:24:44.125 --> 00:24:45.917
Who gives a parking ticket for backing in?

530
00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:47.042
Everyone backs in!

531
00:24:47.042 --> 00:24:49.458
I can't afford a fucking parking ticket
right now.

532
00:24:49.458 --> 00:24:52.958
Cash prize is 25.000 for one day of hoop.

533
00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:55.875
Look. bro. do you wanna play or what?

534
00:24:56.792 --> 00:24:58.125
25K.

535
00:25:01.417 --> 00:25:03.167
Look. we're gonna get in here
and hustle a few games

536
00:25:03.167 --> 00:25:05.250
and get our entry fee for the tournament. Period.

537
00:25:05.917 --> 00:25:08.333
And no one's gonna think that
you can play dressed like that.

538
00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:12.375
I look like a modern hooper
with low body fat and functional strength.

539
00:25:12.375 --> 00:25:14.333
I'm basically a less-fat Luka.

540
00:25:14.333 --> 00:25:17.000
who's the best player in the league
by the way. and once people admit that.

541
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.250
race relations in this country
might actually improve.

542
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.542
I'm just saying we could really use it
to our advantage. all right?

543
00:25:21.542 --> 00:25:24.042
Get on the court. Rinse and repeat
until we get the entry fee.

544
00:25:24.042 --> 00:25:25.125
- How's the knee?
- Great.

545
00:25:25.125 --> 00:25:27.125
Hey. come on. [mutters]
Where the fuck you going?

546
00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:30.125
I mean. am I still the do-it-all playmaker
with elite athleticism?

547
00:25:30.125 --> 00:25:32.250
Not quite.
but I'm getting some bounce back.

548
00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.083
Plus I'm just way better now 'cause of
how my injuries have made me evolve.

549
00:25:35.083 --> 00:25:37.083
Game's easier now. It's way slower.

550
00:25:37.083 --> 00:25:40.583
I just play the angles and let the ball
pretty much come to me wherever I am.

551
00:25:41.958 --> 00:25:43.208
Okay.

552
00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:44.292
What?

553
00:25:44.292 --> 00:25:46.250
[scoffs] Nothing. man.

554
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.333
[whimsical music playing]

555
00:25:52.833 --> 00:25:54.833
[player 1] Offense. offense. Right here.

556
00:25:58.292 --> 00:25:59.292
[player 2] To the wing!

557
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.250
This won't work here.
There's too many white guys.

558
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.542
We need to go back to the Eastside
where they won't see you coming.

559
00:26:05.375 --> 00:26:06.792
The race shit is dated. bro.

560
00:26:06.792 --> 00:26:08.750
Everybody but you
knows white dudes can hoop now.

561
00:26:09.333 --> 00:26:12.125
I'll find some marks. get in their heads.
throw 'em off their game.

562
00:26:12.125 --> 00:26:13.292
and we'll clean up.

563
00:26:14.292 --> 00:26:16.333
I'm great at spotting mental weakness
in hoopers. bro.

564
00:26:16.333 --> 00:26:19.417
I'm like the P.T. Anderson
of basketball psychological warfare.

565
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.833
Who the fuck is P.T. Anderson?

566
00:26:23.208 --> 00:26:24.792
Our greatest living director.

567
00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:27.500
Spike Lee is our greatest living director.

568
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.625
Spike Lee's not even a good Knicks fan.

569
00:26:30.125 --> 00:26:31.875
I knew this was a mistake.

570
00:26:31.875 --> 00:26:34.417
Look. man. You're the one who said
you don't even wanna make friends.

571
00:26:34.417 --> 00:26:36.250
- I don't.
- Let's just make our money.

572
00:26:36.833 --> 00:26:39.083
I guarantee you I can get everyone
out here to bet on themselves.

573
00:26:39.083 --> 00:26:40.458
I got you to put up 300.

574
00:26:43.417 --> 00:26:44.667
[music fades]

575
00:26:44.667 --> 00:26:46.625
- [player 1] Oh!
- [player 2] Okay!

576
00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:47.958
- [player 3] All right!
- [Kamal sighs]

577
00:26:47.958 --> 00:26:50.750
Hey. bro. We got this.

578
00:26:52.667 --> 00:26:53.708
[mouthing] Fuck.

579
00:26:55.917 --> 00:26:57.917
You might wanna shoot
a little closer to the rim.

580
00:26:57.917 --> 00:26:59.458
I feel like you're out of your range.

581
00:27:05.292 --> 00:27:06.333
Told you. man.

582
00:27:08.875 --> 00:27:10.875
Let's put some money on it.
Make it interesting.

583
00:27:11.833 --> 00:27:13.917
One-on-one. First to 11.

584
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.708
You gonna wear that trash bag?

585
00:27:15.708 --> 00:27:18.000
You gonna wear that fake-ass
Richard Simmons outfit?

586
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.458
Let's put 200 on it.

587
00:27:25.167 --> 00:27:26.583
Okay. Fine.

588
00:27:27.167 --> 00:27:30.125
But only because I have a soft spot
for thick-ass ballers like you.

589
00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:32.042
- Who the fuck--
- [Jeremy] Mike Sweetney.

590
00:27:32.042 --> 00:27:33.958
Tractor Traylor. Escalade.

591
00:27:33.958 --> 00:27:36.833
Guys like you were the neck bone
of the league for so long.

592
00:27:36.833 --> 00:27:38.875
[player] Two-on-two and make it 300.

593
00:27:44.083 --> 00:27:45.083
Huh.

594
00:27:46.458 --> 00:27:47.625
Excuse me one second.

595
00:27:49.542 --> 00:27:52.542
See what the fuck he got on?
That's the shit I don't like. bro.

596
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.833
Okay. We've got a problem.

597
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.500
The guy just picked up an Antetokounmpo.

598
00:28:00.375 --> 00:28:02.958
I don't like this at all.
What if they're trying to hustle us?

599
00:28:03.458 --> 00:28:04.708
You got your money?

600
00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:07.083
Nigga. I got nine kids.

601
00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:08.375
Black people come from a long line

602
00:28:08.375 --> 00:28:09.958
- of kings and queens. all right?
- True.

603
00:28:09.958 --> 00:28:12.042
Had to fight for every right
since we been in this country.

604
00:28:12.042 --> 00:28:14.500
- I always say that. Yeah.
- Thank you. It's confidence.

605
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.250
Why would they be afraid of you walking
around looking like a Sierra Mist can?

606
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.833
- True.
- Let's whoop 'em.

607
00:28:19.917 --> 00:28:20.917
You are a king.

608
00:28:20.917 --> 00:28:23.333
All right.

609
00:28:24.333 --> 00:28:25.333
You wanna work. huh?

610
00:28:25.333 --> 00:28:27.083
Oh! [shouts]

611
00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:32.125
- [Kamal] Ball. Ball.
- [groans. grunts]

612
00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:33.292
[player 2] Look at us.

613
00:28:33.833 --> 00:28:35.125
- What are you doing?
- Relax.

614
00:28:35.125 --> 00:28:36.583
[player 2] Whoo-hoo! Yes!

615
00:28:40.667 --> 00:28:41.667
The fuck is that?

616
00:28:41.667 --> 00:28:42.750
[Jeremy] My bad.

617
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.583
Whoa. whoa. whoa! Oh. I get it.

618
00:28:45.583 --> 00:28:48.167
Y'all got like a jungle fever type
connection. huh?

619
00:28:48.167 --> 00:28:49.583
Nasty-ass nigga.

620
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.542
What you looking at. boy?

621
00:28:53.542 --> 00:28:54.667
Easy!

622
00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:56.083
Stop being lazy on D. bro.

623
00:28:56.083 --> 00:28:58.500
Fuck you say? Being lazy?
What. you my overseer now?

624
00:28:59.458 --> 00:29:02.250
I just said a thing that's true.
Everything isn't racist. bro.

625
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.375
You acting like I said.
"Quit being angry. Black fellow."

626
00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:06.042
But you wanted to say that shit.
didn't you?

627
00:29:06.042 --> 00:29:07.333
I'm not one of those people. bro.

628
00:29:07.333 --> 00:29:08.417
One of what people. Jeremy?

629
00:29:08.417 --> 00:29:09.583
People who say stuff like that.

630
00:29:09.583 --> 00:29:10.792
Say stuff like what?

631
00:29:10.792 --> 00:29:13.917
Like. "Oh my. God. Kamal. you're so
well-spoken." Which you are. by the way.

632
00:29:13.917 --> 00:29:16.083
See. you wanted to say that shit
right now. didn't you?

633
00:29:16.083 --> 00:29:18.167
- You have a nice flow. like Obama.
- Man. just stop.

634
00:29:19.417 --> 00:29:21.917
Look. I'm just saying
you don't scream thuggish

635
00:29:21.917 --> 00:29:23.375
even though you're chocolate chocolate.

636
00:29:23.375 --> 00:29:24.917
The fuck is chocolate chocolate?

637
00:29:24.917 --> 00:29:27.083
Well. a lot of Black people these days
are milk chocolate.

638
00:29:27.083 --> 00:29:29.958
And I think it's because interracial
relationships were illegal till the '60s.

639
00:29:29.958 --> 00:29:31.333
It was a fucking rhetorical question.

640
00:29:31.333 --> 00:29:33.250
And you know what?
I'm done with that racist shit.

641
00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.250
- Same. No more race.
- Fine.

642
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.333
- Great.
- Great.

643
00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:38.417
Hey. yo! What the fuck is going on?

644
00:29:39.458 --> 00:29:41.875
[Jeremy] Can you not see
we're having a fucking conversation?

645
00:29:45.792 --> 00:29:46.917
[both grunt]

646
00:29:46.917 --> 00:29:48.167
[Kamal] And one!

647
00:29:48.167 --> 00:29:49.708
Ain't nobody foul you.

648
00:29:49.708 --> 00:29:50.917
You're a hack. bro.

649
00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:53.583
Shoot for it.

650
00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:55.833
- You make it. you get the call.
- [chuckles] Say less.

651
00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.000
[player] Nobody fuckin' fouled him.

652
00:30:00.292 --> 00:30:01.917
I probably should've asked this earlier.

653
00:30:01.917 --> 00:30:03.708
but how much cash do you have on you?

654
00:30:04.667 --> 00:30:06.625
Did you not bring enough money
to cover this game?

655
00:30:08.042 --> 00:30:09.375
I brought. like. 80...

656
00:30:10.292 --> 00:30:11.292
minus 60.

657
00:30:12.917 --> 00:30:16.250
[Kamal] So you brought $20
to cover a $300 bet?

658
00:30:17.292 --> 00:30:18.625
[player] He's trying to cheat 'cause...

659
00:30:18.625 --> 00:30:20.417
When you say it out loud.
it's pretty fucked.

660
00:30:20.417 --> 00:30:21.500
...I had my hand up.

661
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.292
[Kamal] Why don't you just Venmo them
the money that you finessed me for?

662
00:30:24.292 --> 00:30:27.667
- I burned through that days ago.
- [player] It was a shit call. That's it.

663
00:30:28.458 --> 00:30:31.042
They're not just gonna accept $20
on a $300 bet.

664
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.417
Then they better not win. right?

665
00:30:40.625 --> 00:30:42.125
We could really use some rain. huh?

666
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.083
[sighs]

667
00:30:49.208 --> 00:30:50.208
[Kamal] Check up.

668
00:30:50.208 --> 00:30:51.500
Yeah. check up.

669
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.625
["Whoomp! (There It Is)" playing]

670
00:30:53.625 --> 00:30:55.083
[Kamal shouts]

671
00:30:55.083 --> 00:30:56.750
- Fuck!
- [Kamal] There it is!

672
00:31:02.917 --> 00:31:03.875
Game point. baby.

673
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.667
- I'll screen back.
- Switch. switch. switch!

674
00:31:07.167 --> 00:31:08.917
- Oh. yeah.
- Oh. yeah. I'm here.

675
00:31:09.792 --> 00:31:11.125
[Kamal] Mismatch! You got that mismatch.

676
00:31:11.125 --> 00:31:12.625
- Go ahead.
- [player grunts]

677
00:31:12.625 --> 00:31:14.583
Yes. sir! Bucket!

678
00:31:14.583 --> 00:31:15.875
Fuck. man!

679
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.083
[grunts] Yeah. boy. Fucking go.

680
00:31:21.083 --> 00:31:23.500
Boy. look. I don't know how much
you talking shit played into that.

681
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.250
- but good fucking work.
- Thank you.

682
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.875
By the way. bro.
you could talk way more shit out there.

683
00:31:27.875 --> 00:31:29.875
You have so much material
I can't even touch.

684
00:31:30.667 --> 00:31:31.667
Like what?

685
00:31:34.917 --> 00:31:36.333
- Never mind.
- No.

686
00:31:36.958 --> 00:31:37.958
Tell us.

687
00:31:38.542 --> 00:31:40.250
What other Black jokes
you want to say. Jeremy?

688
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.458
- Fuck you say. white boy?
- [spectator] What he say?

689
00:31:42.458 --> 00:31:45.458
You're telling me your friend here
doesn't look exactly like Malcolm X?

690
00:31:45.458 --> 00:31:48.083
[onlookers groaning. laughing]

691
00:31:49.542 --> 00:31:51.542
Hey. yo. Shut the fuck up and play ball.

692
00:31:51.542 --> 00:31:53.375
I'm gonna clamp that ass up.
Let's go. Come on.

693
00:31:53.375 --> 00:31:54.458
It's all love. dude.

694
00:31:54.458 --> 00:31:57.042
[music continues]

695
00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.750
Ball!

696
00:32:01.375 --> 00:32:02.917
And you better bust his ass.

697
00:32:07.708 --> 00:32:09.208
[onlookers shouting. cheering]

698
00:32:09.208 --> 00:32:11.708
[spectator 2]
Yeah. yeah. yeah! Whoo-hoo! All right!

699
00:32:13.167 --> 00:32:14.167
Fuck!

700
00:32:20.833 --> 00:32:22.042
[player] What you doin' now?

701
00:32:22.042 --> 00:32:23.417
This ain't your court.

702
00:32:23.417 --> 00:32:25.375
- It don't work like that. man.
- Hey. fellas.

703
00:32:25.375 --> 00:32:26.875
Why don't y'all just fuck already?

704
00:32:26.875 --> 00:32:29.375
- You're too easy. Hey. it's too easy. dog.
- Quit playing with me. What?

705
00:32:29.375 --> 00:32:30.667
They would look good together. huh?

706
00:32:30.667 --> 00:32:32.042
- Shut the fuck up. man.
- [Kamal] Ball.

707
00:32:34.125 --> 00:32:35.792
[Jeremy] Switch. switch. switch.
switch. switch.

708
00:32:35.792 --> 00:32:36.875
Hey. white boy. What's up?

709
00:32:36.875 --> 00:32:38.708
Nah. you're mine so go on and pass.
Just pass it.

710
00:32:38.708 --> 00:32:40.667
- [player] Watch out. Watch out.
- [Kamal grunts]

711
00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:44.458
Man. get your pussy ass up!
I ain't even hit you that hard.

712
00:32:44.458 --> 00:32:46.625
- That's what we doing now?
- Yeah. that's how we gonna play.

713
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:48.542
Yo. just let it go. 'Mal.

714
00:32:48.542 --> 00:32:50.458
- [player] Yeah. let it go.
- Let it go. Let it go.

715
00:32:50.458 --> 00:32:51.625
Man. he ain't finna do shit--

716
00:32:51.625 --> 00:32:52.708
[grunts]

717
00:32:52.708 --> 00:32:54.083
- Jesus Christ. bro.
- What now. bitch?

718
00:32:54.083 --> 00:32:55.625
[player groans]

719
00:32:55.625 --> 00:32:57.000
What. you want some too?

720
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.542
- Okay. don't look now...
- Huh?

721
00:32:58.542 --> 00:32:59.917
- ...but he has friends coming.
- Uh-uh.

722
00:32:59.917 --> 00:33:01.792
- Fuck his friends.
- [onlooker] I'm outta here.

723
00:33:01.792 --> 00:33:04.042
- Come on. girl. He got a flamethrower.
- Flamethrower?

724
00:33:04.042 --> 00:33:05.458
Yeah. bitch. flamethrower.

725
00:33:06.083 --> 00:33:07.458
What is this? <i>Mad Max</i>?

726
00:33:07.458 --> 00:33:09.750
- [onlookers clamoring]
- [spectator] Aw. hell nah.

727
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.375
- [Kamal] Yo. yo.
- [Jeremy] Yo!

728
00:33:11.958 --> 00:33:14.333
- Damn. Oh. shit. Whoa!
- [onlookers shouting]

729
00:33:15.833 --> 00:33:17.458
What about my car? What about my car?

730
00:33:25.375 --> 00:33:26.958
[tires squeal]

731
00:33:33.042 --> 00:33:33.958
Whoo-hoo!

732
00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.250
[driver] Fuck!

733
00:33:37.125 --> 00:33:38.667
Get the fuck out the way!

734
00:33:39.167 --> 00:33:40.583
[brakes squealing]

735
00:33:40.583 --> 00:33:42.417
- [horn honking]
- Come on. Get in. Get in!

736
00:33:43.583 --> 00:33:45.167
Come on!
Drive. drive. drive. drive. drive!

737
00:33:45.167 --> 00:33:46.500
Yo. where the fuck you going. man?

738
00:33:47.667 --> 00:33:49.833
Come on. man. Come on. come on.
Stop fucking around!

739
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.583
Just fucking drive. Come on. come on.

740
00:33:54.208 --> 00:33:55.750
- Come on. come on. come on.
- [Jeremy grunts]

741
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.542
- You're fucking crazy. bro.
- [horn honking]

742
00:33:57.542 --> 00:33:59.625
[shouting]

743
00:33:59.625 --> 00:34:00.917
[music ends]

744
00:34:03.083 --> 00:34:05.792
[Jeremy] Now. that was the craziest shit
I've ever been through.

745
00:34:05.792 --> 00:34:07.292
- Here. man.
- Thanks. bro.

746
00:34:08.208 --> 00:34:09.292
So. where's your girl?

747
00:34:09.917 --> 00:34:11.333
At work. I gotta go pick her up soon.

748
00:34:11.333 --> 00:34:12.708
That's what's up.

749
00:34:14.333 --> 00:34:15.333
Here. Take this.

750
00:34:17.417 --> 00:34:20.333
All you eat is lettuce.
but then you pop pills?

751
00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:22.417
Life's too short to be in pain
when you don't have to.

752
00:34:23.208 --> 00:34:25.042
You're a complicated dude. bro.

753
00:34:25.625 --> 00:34:26.625
You ever tried therapy?

754
00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:31.917
What. like physical therapy?
That shit takes forever.

755
00:34:31.917 --> 00:34:33.000
No. like. therapy therapy.

756
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.583
Where you sit and talk with a professional
about whatever's on your mind.

757
00:34:37.167 --> 00:34:39.583
Man. I got a barber I've been going to
for. like. 12 years.

758
00:34:39.583 --> 00:34:40.500
Mmm.

759
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.458
Name is Arnold. I pay him 35 bucks.
he gives me a fresh fade.

760
00:34:43.458 --> 00:34:47.292
and I sit and I talk to someone
who actually knows me.

761
00:34:48.083 --> 00:34:50.583
Wow. I wish my therapist
would give me a fresh fade.

762
00:34:50.583 --> 00:34:52.792
That's a beautiful Black experience.

763
00:34:52.792 --> 00:34:55.958
I just think you should try something.
Try meditation.

764
00:34:55.958 --> 00:34:58.917
No offense.
but meditation is for white folks.

765
00:34:58.917 --> 00:35:03.167
None taken. but meditation isn't gonna
turn your skin white. you know?

766
00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:06.417
It's just gonna help you calm yourself
down whenever you're about to lose it.

767
00:35:07.042 --> 00:35:10.083
Oh. you talk more shit than anybody else
I've ever met on the court.

768
00:35:10.083 --> 00:35:11.500
What are you talking about?

769
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.708
Yeah. but only to assholes
or for. like. strategy.

770
00:35:14.708 --> 00:35:17.542
I don't ever get angry.
I never get violent.

771
00:35:18.042 --> 00:35:19.292
Fuck that noise. bro.

772
00:35:23.167 --> 00:35:25.667
Yo. is this you? [chuckles]

773
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.708
Oh. hold up. bro. is this--
Is that this place?

774
00:35:28.708 --> 00:35:31.042
Yeah. I live in the same two bedroom
I grew up in.

775
00:35:31.042 --> 00:35:32.125
With your parents?

776
00:35:32.125 --> 00:35:35.375
[Jeremy] They moved to Vegas to blow
their retirement on slot machines.

777
00:35:35.375 --> 00:35:36.458
I figured I'd keep the place

778
00:35:36.458 --> 00:35:39.625
'cause rent's low-key affordable
since they lived here for so long.

779
00:35:40.792 --> 00:35:42.958
Now. I'm about to whip you up
something real special.

780
00:35:42.958 --> 00:35:44.042
You want a smoothie?

781
00:35:45.333 --> 00:35:46.333
Uh...

782
00:35:47.125 --> 00:35:48.292
Nah. I'm good.

783
00:35:50.333 --> 00:35:52.250
You did pretty good out there today.

784
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:57.833
Another full day of hustling.
and we'll have that 2.500 easy.

785
00:35:57.833 --> 00:35:58.917
[Jeremy] Sick.

786
00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.750
Yeah. my body's feeling better
than it has in a while.

787
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.792
I'm actually excited
to play in this tournament.

788
00:36:04.375 --> 00:36:08.292
I'm gonna take my half of that 25K prize
and fix my body for real.

789
00:36:08.292 --> 00:36:11.792
so I can take a real shot at the G League.
maybe even the big show.

790
00:36:11.792 --> 00:36:13.958
I'm looking into
this regenerative medicine.

791
00:36:14.708 --> 00:36:16.042
This stuff called stem cells.

792
00:36:16.042 --> 00:36:17.542
It's supposed to be a game changer.

793
00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:18.625
So you wanna make more money

794
00:36:18.625 --> 00:36:20.542
to fix your broken body
so you can still play ball.

795
00:36:20.542 --> 00:36:22.833
which is what broke your body
in the first place?

796
00:36:22.833 --> 00:36:23.917
Yep.

797
00:36:23.917 --> 00:36:26.542
[chuckles] Basketball's a curse. bro.

798
00:36:26.542 --> 00:36:28.583
You love basketball.
If I remember correctly.

799
00:36:28.583 --> 00:36:30.667
I met you playing pickup
without a gun to your head.

800
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:32.250
[Jeremy scoffs]

801
00:36:33.667 --> 00:36:36.792
Look. when I was in high school.
my pops took out this crazy loan

802
00:36:36.792 --> 00:36:37.958
and bought me an Escalade

803
00:36:37.958 --> 00:36:40.083
just 'cause he thought
I was going to make it to the league.

804
00:36:40.667 --> 00:36:41.875
Now I'm a nobody.

805
00:36:42.458 --> 00:36:44.292
And that Escalade
needs a new transmission.

806
00:36:45.625 --> 00:36:47.125
[Jeremy] Everybody's a nobody. bro.

807
00:36:47.125 --> 00:36:49.458
It doesn't matter how much money you have.
we're all the same.

808
00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:50.542
[Kamal] Hmm.

809
00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:53.375
[Jeremy] I grew up just as broke as you.
I just don't let it define me.

810
00:36:53.375 --> 00:36:56.458
That's 'cause you have the privilege of
being defined by never needing a haircut.

811
00:36:56.458 --> 00:36:58.208
Tatiana cut my hair last week.

812
00:37:00.208 --> 00:37:01.292
Yeah. it shows.

813
00:37:01.292 --> 00:37:04.083
Why are Black guys so obsessed
with haircuts?

814
00:37:04.083 --> 00:37:06.125
Why do white guys not give a fuck
about 'em?

815
00:37:06.125 --> 00:37:07.667
[Jeremy]
Thought we said no more race. bro.

816
00:37:07.667 --> 00:37:08.833
No more race. bro.

817
00:37:10.667 --> 00:37:12.083
[sighs]

818
00:37:12.083 --> 00:37:14.125
[lively music playing on speaker]

819
00:37:16.125 --> 00:37:17.208
It's a banger. right?

820
00:37:18.375 --> 00:37:19.625
What?

821
00:37:19.625 --> 00:37:20.833
It's cool.

822
00:37:20.833 --> 00:37:22.875
- I saw you tapping your foot.
- No. you didn't.

823
00:37:22.875 --> 00:37:25.083
Bro. you were literally just
tapping your foot to the beat.

824
00:37:25.083 --> 00:37:26.208
But I wasn't. though.

825
00:37:26.708 --> 00:37:28.458
- Oh. okay. So you don't like this?
- No.

826
00:37:28.458 --> 00:37:30.333
Okay. do you like any white artists?

827
00:37:30.333 --> 00:37:32.042
[sighs] I don't know.

828
00:37:32.042 --> 00:37:36.208
That one redhead dude
who also has trash-ass haircuts.

829
00:37:36.208 --> 00:37:38.250
- Ed Sheeran?
- Yeah. Him.

830
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:39.500
I fuck with him.

831
00:37:40.125 --> 00:37:41.375
[Jeremy] All right. so imagine this.

832
00:37:41.375 --> 00:37:44.125
You're in your Escalade.
riding down Slauson. windows down.

833
00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:46.042
vibing to some fucking Ed.

834
00:37:46.625 --> 00:37:50.375
You pull up to a light. you look over.
it's a car full of fellow Black men.

835
00:37:50.375 --> 00:37:53.708
You either A. turn that shit down
as quick as you can.

836
00:37:53.708 --> 00:37:57.458
or B. keep singing
those timeless classics.

837
00:37:57.458 --> 00:37:58.583
Hey. 'Mal. guess what?

838
00:37:58.583 --> 00:37:59.667
What?

839
00:38:01.125 --> 00:38:02.125
I love the shape of you.

840
00:38:02.125 --> 00:38:04.083
What-- Get the fuck outta here.

841
00:38:04.083 --> 00:38:05.167
- Shit.
- I do.

842
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.417
[Kamal scoffs] Here.

843
00:38:07.417 --> 00:38:08.958
Thanks for the heating pad. man.

844
00:38:09.542 --> 00:38:11.042
Hey. no problem.

845
00:38:11.042 --> 00:38:13.542
Just. uh. don't baby the hand.
You'll be good in a few days.

846
00:38:13.542 --> 00:38:14.625
Hey. look.

847
00:38:15.958 --> 00:38:17.708
my son's having a birthday party
this Saturday.

848
00:38:17.708 --> 00:38:19.375
- You should roll through.
- [scoffs]

849
00:38:20.083 --> 00:38:21.125
That's so fire.

850
00:38:21.875 --> 00:38:22.875
I fuck with kids.

851
00:38:25.417 --> 00:38:26.917
- Yeah. maybe don't say it like that.
- Nah.

852
00:38:26.917 --> 00:38:29.000
I'm saying. like. kids are a vibe.
they're chill.

853
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.417
Got you. And look. bring Tatiana too.
All right? So she can meet Imani.

854
00:38:33.292 --> 00:38:35.333
[Jeremy] She'll love that.
Just. uh. do me a favor.

855
00:38:36.042 --> 00:38:38.792
Don't bring up the hooping
or the stem cells.

856
00:38:38.792 --> 00:38:40.792
Definitely don't mention
the gambling. Please.

857
00:38:40.792 --> 00:38:43.583
I kind of told Tatiana
I'm done with all that stuff.

858
00:38:43.583 --> 00:38:44.917
Sounds like a healthy relationship.

859
00:38:44.917 --> 00:38:46.125
It is.

860
00:38:46.125 --> 00:38:49.458
Okay. Hey. don't spend any of the money
until we can cover the fee. all right?

861
00:38:49.458 --> 00:38:50.625
I should be saying that to you.

862
00:38:50.625 --> 00:38:52.167
- Boy. I'm good with money.

863
00:38:52.167 --> 00:38:53.375
- So am I.

864
00:38:53.375 --> 00:38:54.583
- Me too.
- Word.

865
00:38:54.583 --> 00:38:55.667
Word. bro.

866
00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:57.417
[chuckles]

867
00:38:57.417 --> 00:38:58.500
Clean up. man.

868
00:38:59.501 --> 00:39:01.625
[people chattering]

869
00:39:04.708 --> 00:39:08.042
[person] Hey. hey. What's up. girl?
Come on. What you got?

870
00:39:09.458 --> 00:39:11.458
[children scream. giggle]

871
00:39:12.333 --> 00:39:13.333
Come here.

872
00:39:15.208 --> 00:39:17.292
- Do me a favor. all right?
- Hmm?

873
00:39:17.292 --> 00:39:20.208
Take this 10. give it to your grandma.
Tell her I need an eighth.

874
00:39:20.208 --> 00:39:21.333
- Okay.
- Okay?

875
00:39:21.333 --> 00:39:22.750
- Okay.
- Don't short her.

876
00:39:25.333 --> 00:39:26.625
- Where the doobie?
- It's on the way.

877
00:39:26.625 --> 00:39:27.792
- Ooh!
- Yes. man.

878
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.375
Drew. slow down.

879
00:39:30.375 --> 00:39:31.583
Don't worry. I got him.

880
00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:32.667
Thank you.

881
00:39:32.667 --> 00:39:34.458
- Hmm.
- Yeah. you still ugly.

882
00:39:35.042 --> 00:39:36.208
Yo. where you been?

883
00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:38.917
I've literally been setting up by myself
this whole time.

884
00:39:39.708 --> 00:39:41.708
- [clears throat]
- No. you don't get to bring Sprinkles

885
00:39:41.708 --> 00:39:43.583
and think shit is all good.
It's not giving that.

886
00:39:43.583 --> 00:39:44.833
- No?
- No.

887
00:39:47.042 --> 00:39:48.292
Oatmeal chocolate chip.

888
00:39:49.417 --> 00:39:50.500
For the queen.

889
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.250
- Damn cookie.
- Mmm.

890
00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:56.833
Does this cookie mean
you made it to the bank?

891
00:39:56.833 --> 00:39:58.917
We're coming up on a week late now. babe.

892
00:39:58.917 --> 00:40:00.208
Already done.

893
00:40:00.208 --> 00:40:01.292
How?

894
00:40:02.542 --> 00:40:03.958
Just playing some ball again.

895
00:40:05.125 --> 00:40:06.292
- Okay.
- Yeah.

896
00:40:06.875 --> 00:40:09.167
I know that's not the parole officer
coming to the function.

897
00:40:09.167 --> 00:40:11.917
[friend] With a little caramel queen too?
The gall.

898
00:40:13.458 --> 00:40:14.542
Tatiana's Black?

899
00:40:15.667 --> 00:40:17.500
The Bon Iver concert canceled. homey.

900
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.917
Is that why you're not selling
water bottles at SoFi?

901
00:40:20.708 --> 00:40:22.542
You gonna let him talk about you
like that. Black man?

902
00:40:22.542 --> 00:40:23.833
[Speedy] That's essential work.

903
00:40:25.708 --> 00:40:27.542
Hello. How are you?

904
00:40:27.542 --> 00:40:29.000
[Lorenzo giggles]

905
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.333
Don't worry about that. Lorenzo.

906
00:40:31.333 --> 00:40:32.583
Hi.

907
00:40:32.583 --> 00:40:34.208
[Lorenzo] Look at yourself.
Look at yourself.

908
00:40:34.208 --> 00:40:35.917
Man. sit your ass down. bro.

909
00:40:35.917 --> 00:40:37.167
Hey. man.

910
00:40:37.167 --> 00:40:39.083
How you doing? I'm Kamal.

911
00:40:39.083 --> 00:40:40.875
- Hi.
- Nice to finally meet you.

912
00:40:40.875 --> 00:40:43.250
It's nice to meet you too. Jeremy says
you're on his detox program?

913
00:40:44.042 --> 00:40:46.083
Ri-- Yeah. no. Um...

914
00:40:46.083 --> 00:40:51.500
Yes. With the parsley and the-- and my gas
is better now. and I'm shitting right.

915
00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.750
Like. it's...

916
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.792
Hey. You must be Tatiana and Jeremy.

917
00:40:55.792 --> 00:40:58.458
- I'm Imani. Kamal's wife.
- So nice to meet you.

918
00:40:58.458 --> 00:41:00.542
- Thanks for having us.
- Yeah. no problem.

919
00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:02.708
- Hennessy.
- Oh. yeah.

920
00:41:03.667 --> 00:41:07.500
You-- Yeah. It's-It's one of
my favorite cognacs. You know. so...

921
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.958
People have no idea how much care

922
00:41:08.958 --> 00:41:11.042
goes into making this
such a smooth and warm blend.

923
00:41:11.708 --> 00:41:14.125
Seriously. And they've been doing it
since 1765.

924
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:16.167
Feel like it's slept on.

925
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.458
- Oh. Okay.
- [Kamal] Hmm.

926
00:41:19.458 --> 00:41:21.792
Auntie. uh.
can you turn for us so we can jump rope?

927
00:41:21.792 --> 00:41:23.917
- Yeah. boo. I'll be right there.
- All right. Thank you.

928
00:41:23.917 --> 00:41:25.750
- Can I help?
- Yeah. come on.

929
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.667
Let me know if you guys need any backup.

930
00:41:27.667 --> 00:41:29.458
- Boy. get out of here.
- Fine.

931
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.583
Now I'm a part of your lies?

932
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:33.750
[scoffs]

933
00:41:35.417 --> 00:41:36.833
- [person] What's up. white boy?
- Wow.

934
00:41:40.417 --> 00:41:42.500
You would never eat that
if you were on my cleanse.

935
00:41:43.458 --> 00:41:44.458
Yeah. you right.

936
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.375
[sucks teeth] Mmm.

937
00:41:49.958 --> 00:41:52.375
How come everybody
always buys my son basketball stuff?

938
00:41:53.417 --> 00:41:56.625
I don't know. maybe because his dad
is kind of a well-known basketball player.

939
00:41:56.625 --> 00:41:58.208
[chuckles] Yeah. Was.

940
00:41:59.417 --> 00:42:02.417
[partygoers laughing]

941
00:42:05.083 --> 00:42:06.083
[Jeremy] Who's that?

942
00:42:07.208 --> 00:42:08.292
My pops.

943
00:42:08.292 --> 00:42:09.458
Oh. shit.

944
00:42:10.792 --> 00:42:12.625
- [sighs]
- [Lorenzo] Ah!

945
00:42:12.625 --> 00:42:14.458
- Oh. no. He crazy for that.
- MS.

946
00:42:14.458 --> 00:42:17.125
He got diagnosed
when I was in high school.

947
00:42:17.125 --> 00:42:20.208
The night I got arrested?
He was in the hospital.

948
00:42:20.792 --> 00:42:21.875
Sorry to hear that.

949
00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:22.958
[Kamal] It's cool.

950
00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:24.625
It is what it is.

951
00:42:24.625 --> 00:42:26.917
[laughing]

952
00:42:27.542 --> 00:42:29.042
The extra pickup money really helped.

953
00:42:29.708 --> 00:42:32.208
My girl started doing hair in our crib
to make ends meet.

954
00:42:32.875 --> 00:42:34.667
Now she doesn't wanna go back
to working at a salon.

955
00:42:34.667 --> 00:42:35.750
So I been raising money

956
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:40.083
so I can get her and her bougie-ass
friends out my fucking living room.

957
00:42:41.375 --> 00:42:42.375
I feel you.

958
00:42:42.375 --> 00:42:44.958
My girl's a crazy talented
choreographer who--

959
00:42:44.958 --> 00:42:48.208
who's wasting her time
teaching classes at a dance studio

960
00:42:48.208 --> 00:42:50.250
because my income's so shaky right now.

961
00:42:52.042 --> 00:42:54.500
[laughs] What up. Pop?

962
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.792
How you doing. son?

963
00:42:56.958 --> 00:42:58.708
Gonzaga basketball. right?

964
00:42:58.708 --> 00:42:59.917
How'd you know?

965
00:42:59.917 --> 00:43:03.167
I watch all the good ones.
You had a nice touch.

966
00:43:03.167 --> 00:43:04.250
Thank you. sir.

967
00:43:04.875 --> 00:43:07.458
[scoffs] Oh. man.
this dude is already cocky enough.

968
00:43:09.333 --> 00:43:12.333
Got to have some confidence to bring
a bottle of Henny to a Black function.

969
00:43:13.542 --> 00:43:15.042
It's all I drink. honestly.

970
00:43:15.042 --> 00:43:17.458
[Kamal's father]
It's funny you two being friends.

971
00:43:17.458 --> 00:43:20.000
I bet y'all got more in common
than meets the eye.

972
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.833
- That's debatable.
- I doubt that.

973
00:43:23.958 --> 00:43:26.708
Like I said. a lot in common.

974
00:43:27.625 --> 00:43:28.792
You want something to drink?

975
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.000
Yeah. give me some of that Henny.

976
00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:33.667
- I can drive the boat for you. sir.
- No.

977
00:43:33.667 --> 00:43:35.542
[laughs]
See this a good friend you got here.

978
00:43:35.542 --> 00:43:36.458
Nah.

979
00:43:41.208 --> 00:43:43.208
I had no idea about Kamal's pops.

980
00:43:44.167 --> 00:43:47.208
Dude was like the star of the show when
Kamal was the best player in the country.

981
00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:49.125
Life is crazy.

982
00:43:51.375 --> 00:43:53.250
- What happened?
- [Tatiana] Um...

983
00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:59.125
The studio got me a meeting with SZA to
go on tour as her assistant choreographer.

984
00:43:59.125 --> 00:44:00.375
Babe. that's amazing.

985
00:44:00.375 --> 00:44:02.833
[stammers] It's just a meeting.
I don't know. [sighs]

986
00:44:02.833 --> 00:44:05.375
Yeah. but it's a compliment that
they put you up there for that.

987
00:44:05.375 --> 00:44:08.167
- [stammers]
- She obviously sees how special you are.

988
00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:10.833
The money's not great.

989
00:44:10.833 --> 00:44:12.667
but my job would still be here
when I get back.

990
00:44:12.667 --> 00:44:13.750
Another win.

991
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:17.542
It-- It's like significantly less.
actually. Um...

992
00:44:17.542 --> 00:44:19.208
Babe. take the win.

993
00:44:19.708 --> 00:44:20.875
I don't know.

994
00:44:20.875 --> 00:44:22.125
Take the win.

995
00:44:22.917 --> 00:44:26.417
Listen. if you want to make this happen.
we're gonna make this happen.

996
00:44:27.042 --> 00:44:28.208
How?

997
00:44:28.208 --> 00:44:30.792
Well. I don't wanna jinx it.

998
00:44:30.792 --> 00:44:35.000
but I kind of have an opportunity
of my own to make us some extra bread.

999
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.083
Like a lot. actually.

1000
00:44:37.083 --> 00:44:38.625
Like doing what?

1001
00:44:39.292 --> 00:44:41.917
Just some private workouts
with some high-end guys.

1002
00:44:41.917 --> 00:44:44.417
It's not a big deal.
but I could make like ten grand.

1003
00:44:44.917 --> 00:44:46.458
- What?
- Yeah.

1004
00:44:46.458 --> 00:44:49.250
- No big deal? Are you insane?
- Yeah.

1005
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:53.125
- What is wrong with you?
- Okay. fine. Fuck it. It's a big deal.

1006
00:44:53.125 --> 00:44:55.708
- Yeah.
- Let's celebrate our good news together.

1007
00:44:56.292 --> 00:44:58.833
Hmm. What did you have in mind?

1008
00:45:05.333 --> 00:45:06.583
- [Jeremy grunts]
- I got it.

1009
00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:12.042
How's your knee?

1010
00:45:13.667 --> 00:45:14.792
It's good. Why?

1011
00:45:15.917 --> 00:45:18.083

01:09:58.542 --> 01:10:01.000
I actually don't know
what the fuck you wanna do.

1512
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:05.167
[cell phone ringing]

1513
01:10:06.333 --> 01:10:08.500
[sighing]

1514
01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.750
- [scoffs] Fucking joke.
- [phone stops ringing]

1515
01:10:12.167 --> 01:10:13.167
Hello?

1516
01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.500
Excuse me.

1517
01:10:19.375 --> 01:10:20.375
Excuse me.

1518
01:10:20.875 --> 01:10:22.667
I'm here to see Benji Allen. I'm his son.

1519
01:10:22.667 --> 01:10:24.375
[nurse] Yeah. Just one visitor at a time.

1520
01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:25.458
- Sit.
- Go.

1521
01:10:25.458 --> 01:10:26.583
All right.

1522
01:10:26.583 --> 01:10:28.625
- [whispering] Come here. baby.
- Go with Mommy. buddy. okay?

1523
01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:29.875
All right.

1524
01:10:30.542 --> 01:10:31.917
[machine beeping]

1525
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.167
[door closes]

1526
01:10:37.625 --> 01:10:38.625
Hey. Pop.

1527
01:10:40.542 --> 01:10:41.542
Hey.

1528
01:10:43.958 --> 01:10:45.250
So. what they sayin'?

1529
01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.875
You know I know more about my health
than they ever do.

1530
01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:50.958
[chuckles]

1531
01:10:52.208 --> 01:10:55.417
Gonzaga must've missed
a lot of open shots to get you that upset.

1532
01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:58.875
- [Benji groans]
- I'm sorry. Pop.

1533
01:11:01.375 --> 01:11:05.333
I'm sorry I keep making
the same stupid fucking mistakes.

1534
01:11:07.958 --> 01:11:10.417
And you're not supposed to be
living like this. I'll--

1535
01:11:12.375 --> 01:11:13.833
I'm sorry for letting you down.

1536
01:11:15.583 --> 01:11:17.167
[Benji] Is that what you think?

1537
01:11:19.917 --> 01:11:21.292
You let me down?

1538
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.042
[sighs] I hid my illness
thinking I was protecting you.

1539
01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:29.667
I was scared.
and so I made you scared too.

1540
01:11:30.792 --> 01:11:32.500
I'm the one who let you down. son.

1541
01:11:34.792 --> 01:11:36.000
[Benji stammers. sighs]

1542
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.833
I don't give a damn about the NBA.

1543
01:11:40.042 --> 01:11:44.583
My biggest regret is not giving you
the tools to work through your problems.

1544
01:11:46.875 --> 01:11:49.792
It's time to stop punishing yourself
just 'cause...

1545
01:11:49.792 --> 01:11:52.208
[sighs]
...things didn't work out how we hoped.

1546
01:11:54.083 --> 01:11:58.333
Your family deserves to know
the joyful you.

1547
01:11:58.333 --> 01:12:00.625
not the guy with a chip on his shoulder.

1548
01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:04.708
And I was so happy to see
you playing ball again.

1549
01:12:07.458 --> 01:12:10.375
'Cause I still remember how much
you used to love it.

1550
01:12:10.375 --> 01:12:11.917
That's right. that's right.

1551
01:12:11.917 --> 01:12:13.375
Come on. Keep going.

1552
01:12:14.083 --> 01:12:15.542
How much it got you through.

1553
01:12:16.792 --> 01:12:18.750
Oh. yes! Yeah! Did you see that?

1554
01:12:20.292 --> 01:12:22.042
I'm sorry I took away that joy.

1555
01:12:22.042 --> 01:12:23.583
But you didn't. though. Pop.

1556
01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:26.542
I still love the game.

1557
01:12:28.542 --> 01:12:29.958
And you gave it to me.

1558
01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:34.417
It was our game.

1559
01:12:35.292 --> 01:12:36.292
[sniffles]

1560
01:12:36.792 --> 01:12:38.083
It'll always be our game.

1561
01:12:40.208 --> 01:12:41.208
[chuckles]

1562
01:12:48.417 --> 01:12:50.542
[sniffles. kisses]

1563
01:12:50.542 --> 01:12:53.667
[crying]

1564
01:12:53.667 --> 01:12:55.250
[sighs]

1565
01:12:57.167 --> 01:12:58.583
[cries]

1566
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.375
- What's up. bro?
- What's happening?

1567
01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:09.583
What's up. y'all?

1568
01:13:09.583 --> 01:13:10.667
Is he cool?

1569
01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:12.458
I don't know.

1570
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:16.875
They're monitoring him.
and they'll call if his vitals drop.

1571
01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:23.875
[sniffles. exhales deeply]

1572
01:13:23.875 --> 01:13:25.458
Hey. y'all still trying to play in

1573
01:13:25.458 --> 01:13:27.208
that basketball tournament in Leimert?

1574
01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:31.333
Look. I'm not even
gonna hold you. bro. that's...

1575
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.208
That's a big-ass event. bro.
with a whole bunch of pressure. man.

1576
01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:38.208
- I don't wanna fuck yo shit up.
- Oh. come on. Fuck the pressure. man.

1577
01:13:38.208 --> 01:13:41.042
Look. I don't want Drew growing up
thinking that his father was a quitter.

1578
01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:42.667
Look. man. Even if we wanted to.

1579
01:13:42.667 --> 01:13:47.083
tell me how are we supposed to find
$7.500 for the entry fee by this weekend?

1580
01:13:47.083 --> 01:13:48.125
True.

1581
01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:49.750
There's gotta be a way.

1582
01:13:50.875 --> 01:13:51.875
I do got a boy.

1583
01:13:52.458 --> 01:13:53.625
He's good at taking pictures.

1584
01:13:53.625 --> 01:13:56.833
He could probably set up a OnlyFans
if you put on little-ass VTX shorts.

1585
01:13:56.833 --> 01:13:58.542
he could photoshop
your bulge a little bit bigger.

1586
01:13:58.542 --> 01:14:01.292
You actin' as a postman.
We know what you deliver.

1587
01:14:01.292 --> 01:14:02.875
What if I put five grand on it?

1588
01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:04.417
From my salon money.

1589
01:14:05.042 --> 01:14:08.750
Babe. I'm not gambling your salon money
on a basketball game.

1590
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:11.292
You're not. I'm gambling on my husband.

1591
01:14:11.792 --> 01:14:14.500
- [Kamal] What if we lose?
- Not worried about you losing.

1592
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.917
I'm worried about
you missing out on a opportunity

1593
01:14:16.917 --> 01:14:18.542
to show the world that you that nigga.

1594
01:14:19.083 --> 01:14:20.083
So with that being said.

1595
01:14:20.083 --> 01:14:22.167
I need you to go out there
and win that money.

1596
01:14:27.333 --> 01:14:28.583
- Love you.
- Love you.

1597
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:31.708
This is why Black love is so pivotal.

1598
01:14:31.708 --> 01:14:33.208
'Cause five minutes ago.

1599
01:14:33.208 --> 01:14:36.542
Speedy was thinking that you was gonna
put on that black ski mask and get active.

1600
01:14:36.542 --> 01:14:37.458
Man--

1601
01:14:37.458 --> 01:14:39.917
- [Speedy] I didn't mean like that. I was...
- [Lorenzo] No. he did.

1602
01:14:39.917 --> 01:14:41.417
Y'all figure out that other 2.500.

1603
01:14:41.417 --> 01:14:42.750
How we supposed to do that?

1604
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:44.375
You could ask Mildred.

1605
01:14:45.042 --> 01:14:46.833
I can't. We on a break right now.

1606
01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:48.458
Oh. That's good. nigga.

1607
01:14:48.458 --> 01:14:50.333
She didn't really understand
my love language.

1608
01:14:50.333 --> 01:14:51.250
Mmm.

1609
01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:54.375
She thought it was gift giving.
but I'm more about physical touch.

1610
01:14:54.375 --> 01:14:57.792
Well. the greatest gift she could give you
is not touching you.

1611
01:14:59.125 --> 01:15:00.333
You know what? I got you.

1612
01:15:00.333 --> 01:15:02.208
Nurse! My man needs some help.

1613
01:15:02.208 --> 01:15:04.417
He has an affinity for
fat-ass white women.

["What U See Is What U Get" playing]

1615
01:15:10.458 --> 01:15:12.083
What's up. all my beautiful people?

1616
01:15:12.083 --> 01:15:14.625
We live from
the historic Leimert Park Village

1617
01:15:14.625 --> 01:15:16.625
for the three-on-three Village Classic.

1618
01:15:16.625 --> 01:15:20.000
Oh. and it's going down. where the top
players in the city get to square off

1619
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.625
for a grand prize of $500.000.

1620

Ooh-wee. that's a lot of money
on the table today. baby.

1621

We got the legendary DJ Battlecat
in the house tonight.

1622
01:15:29.542 --> 01:15:31.167
I go by the name of QwessCoast.

1623
01:15:31.167 --> 01:15:34.208
I gotta give a special shout-out to
all the sponsors in the house.

1624
01:15:34.208 --> 01:15:36.458
[grunts] You're a big boy now.

1625
01:15:37.042 --> 01:15:39.000
- What you doing back there? All right?
- Yeah.

- [Lorenzo mutters]
- You okay?

1630
01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:46.917
Nah. I'm good.

1631
01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:48.875
Baby. relax.

1632
01:15:48.875 --> 01:15:50.167

Who invited him?

1636
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:10.583
Just talk to him.

1637
01:16:10.583 --> 01:16:11.667
For me?

1638
01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:13.250
- Please?
- [Lorenzo] Talk to him for what?

1639
01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:14.833
Nigga. ain't he the opps?

1640
01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:20.083
It's cool.

Go with Mom. okay?

1642
01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:23.500
I'll be back.

- Don't drink one of them juices.

Yeah. bro.
Can't have yo booty leaking on the court.

1645

- [Speedy] Mm-mmm.
- [Imani] Don't do that.

1647
01:16:32.417 --> 01:16:34.708
Yo.

1649
01:16:41.292 --> 01:16:43.125
I came here to move past the bullshit

1650

and see if
I can help you guys win this thing.

1651
01:16:48.792 --> 01:16:50.750

- Yeah. my bad.

[music stops]

1653
01:17:00.792 --> 01:17:01.792
You were right. man.

1654
01:17:01.792 --> 01:17:03.292
I was selfish.

1655
01:17:03.292 --> 01:17:05.167
I've never been able
to make a living off hoop.

1656
01:17:05.167 --> 01:17:06.542
My body's gone to shit.

1657
01:17:06.542 --> 01:17:08.917
Who knows if I was even good enough
before I got hurt.

1658
01:17:08.917 --> 01:17:12.042
but I have to grow up
or I'm gonna lose Tati for good.

1659
01:17:12.042 --> 01:17:14.375
She's the only thing in my life
that actually matters.

1660
01:17:14.375 --> 01:17:16.458
I've been chasing basketball
instead of doing right by her.

1661
01:17:16.458 --> 01:17:18.792
Bro. what are you doing
here at a basketball tournament?

1662
01:17:19.417 --> 01:17:21.583
I-- I came here
to help you redeem yourself.

1663
01:17:22.125 --> 01:17:24.750
[chuckles] Get the fuck outta here.

1664
01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:27.042
- You need money. That's it.
- Oh. no doubt.

1665
01:17:27.958 --> 01:17:29.333
If I'm in the same spot I was in

1666
01:17:29.333 --> 01:17:31.125
when she gets back from tour
with those big shots.

1667
01:17:31.125 --> 01:17:32.292
I'm finished.

1668
01:17:32.292 --> 01:17:34.458
But I wanna let you know
this is my last dance.

1669
01:17:34.458 --> 01:17:36.750
I'm playing to win. That's all.

1670
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:38.292
Who you playing with?

1671
01:17:39.292 --> 01:17:41.500
Imani said
you guys might need an extra body.

1672
01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.792
Each team gets an alternate or something.

1673
01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:45.083
Right.

1674
01:17:52.458 --> 01:17:54.458
But your ass is coming off the bench.

1675
01:17:55.583 --> 01:17:57.500
Who we playing with? Bron and AD?

1676
01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:02.292
Okay. It's your squad.

1677
01:18:02.292 --> 01:18:03.500
I'm just here to help.

1678
01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.667

That you're sorry?

1905
01:30:46.125 --> 01:30:47.500
I know. You told me.

1906
01:30:52.542 --> 01:30:54.583
All I wanted was for you to support me.

1907
01:30:54.583 --> 01:30:56.667
- I know. I--
- It really fucked me up

1908
01:30:56.667 --> 01:31:00.000
when you couldn't even be happy for me
for getting an opportunity.

1909
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.417
And I'll never forgive myself for that.

1910
01:31:02.417 --> 01:31:05.292
I was all about me. and I lied to you.

1911
01:31:06.542 --> 01:31:09.458
I was afraid that your dreams would
take you away from me.

1912
01:31:09.458 --> 01:31:12.625
and I'm just [scoffs] some dumb loser.

1913
01:31:12.625 --> 01:31:14.250
You're not a dumb loser.

1914
01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:16.292
But that's what I became when you left.

1915
01:31:22.167 --> 01:31:24.708

I just wanna be with you. Tati.

1921
01:31:38.083 --> 01:31:39.083
Will you marry me?

1922
01:31:41.458 --> 01:31:43.042
Under the condition that I promise

1923
01:31:43.042 --> 01:31:46.208
to never lie to you. neglect you.

1924
01:31:46.208 --> 01:31:49.333
or be that asshole
who didn't appreciate you ever again.

1925
01:31:52.708 --> 01:31:55.417
If you can get up without help.
I'll sleep on it.

1926
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:58.583
- I need your help.
- Do you really need help?

1927
01:31:58.583 --> 01:32:00.375
- Pick me up. woman.

shots and turmeric and. uh. meditation.
