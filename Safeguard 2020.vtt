00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.008
What's in the bag?

4
00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.718
I can't say.

5
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.386
Pull yourself together!

6
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.223
Be quiet!

7
00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:50.194
Where's the package? Where is it?

8
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.988
Tell us now or die a traitor!

9
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.365
Fuck you! You'll never find it.

10
00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.492
Check the back.

11
00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.453
See if anyone is still alive.

12
00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.580
{\an8}Find them right now!

13
00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:04.208
{\an8}Let's go!

14
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.960
{\an8}Hey! Listen up...

15
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.128
{\an8}If we can't find it. we are dead.

16
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.756

17
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:13.008
{\an8}Go to the right.

18
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.510
{\an8}Over there!

19
00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.055
{\an8}Where is it?

20
00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.850
Kinji?

21
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.270
Are you okay?

22
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.814
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. It's just...

23
00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:10.774
What's going on? Where have you been?

24
00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:14.027
Please. just sit down.
There's something I need to tell you.

25
00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.657
You're worrying me.
What's going on?

26
00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:22.995
Sakura. please just listen to me.

27
00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.998
We have to leave Tokyo.

28
00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.042
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen.

29
00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.503
- When?
- Tonight.

30
00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:36.758
I'll explain more after we've left.
You just have to trust me.

31
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.891
Of course I trust you. But go where?
You mean to another house or city?

32
00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:48.604
No. We have to leave Japan and move to London.
We have to leave now.

33
00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:53.275
- London? But that's...
- l know. but we don't have another choice.

34
00:03:53.317 --> 00:03:58.447
- Has it got something to do with your work?
- I can't say anymore here.

35
00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:01.617
We have to leave right away.

36
00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:05.913
Okay. I trust you.

37
00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:11.710
I'll sort the kids out and pack everything.
I hope you've got a plan for us Kinji.

38
00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.212
We can't let anything happen to them.

39
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:18.509
Of course I do. don't worry. Everything will be fine.

40
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.428
Nothing will happen to any of them.
I promise.

41
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:24.848
Okay.

42
00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.677
Timmy. the food's ready.

43
00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.512
Okay. got it.

44
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:35.836
Focus! No mistakes today.

45
00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.746
Good night. Junpei.

46
00:06:15.334 --> 00:06:17.794
Sweet dreams.

47
00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:19.875
- How was everything?
- The food was great.

48
00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:24.296
- Please send my compliments to the chef.
- Thank you so much.

49
00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.675
How long have you had the restaurand for. may I ask?

50
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:35.557
Must be 3 years now!
Time certainly does fly.

51
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:38.143
Well you've certainly achieved a lot in 3 years.

52
00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:44.942
Thank you. We're still growing!
My husband has a lot of ideas.

53
00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:47.069
I can imagine.

54
00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:50.489
That must be the chef?

55
00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:52.574
Kinji.

56
00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:58.121
This gentleman was just paying you
a very nice compliment.

57
00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:00.791
Thank you so much.
My name is Kinji.

58
00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:05.546
- Yasuyuki.
- It's a pleasure to have you here.

59
00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:10.592
I've been trying to find a good
Japanese restaurant in London!

60
00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:14.346
I see. You are welcome back anytime. Yasuyuki.

61
00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:16.139
I will definitely be back. Thank you.

62
00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:21.687
Well. we are closing the kitchen soon.
It was nice to meet you. Yasuyuki.

63
00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:25.774
- Yes. Thank you.
- Excuse me.

64
00:09:25.816 --> 00:09:29.778
- Lovely to meet you.
- And you.

65
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:38.745
Prawns. prawns. prawns...

66
00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:41.248
Carrot...
Boss. join us!

67
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.125
Okay!

68
00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:46.753
- What's going on in here!?
- Let's dance. Mio!

69
00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:51.675
Prawns. prawns. prawns...

70
00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:56.513
Sorry. boss. I'm so sorry.

71
00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.028
Jinpei!

72
00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:36.762
- Kinji. Good to see you.
- Yasuyuki.

73
00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:40.516
I didn't know you had a son at the same school?

74
00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:44.895
Yes. he started a few weeks ago.

75
00:10:44.937 --> 00:10:46.772
What a coincidence!

76
00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:51.068
- It's a great school. He's in safe hands.
- Yes. so I've heard.

77
00:10:56.907 --> 00:10:58.909
You should stop by the restaurant again.

78
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:02.621
Bring your wife or a friend next time.

79
00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:05.832
My wife is out of town at the moment...

80
00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:10.420
but I may stop by again.
Thank you for the offer.

81
00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:14.550
You're welcome. We also have a new menu.

82
00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:19.805
New menu? That sounds very tempting.

83
00:11:19.847 --> 00:11:24.977
- Okay. I'll see you tonight.
- Great! See you later. Yasuyuki.

84
00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:27.938
Thank you. See you later.

85
00:11:46.957 --> 00:11:48.333
Well hello again!

86
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:53.797
- Great to see you back so soon.
- Thank you. it's nice to be back.

87
00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:57.843
Kinji told me about the new menu.
I would love to try it!

88
00:11:57.885 --> 00:12:02.848
Yes. it's a little different to what you
might expect.

89
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.476
Is that right?
Looking forward to it.

90
00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:08.854
Mio. Mio!

91
00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:12.900
Hello!

92
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:15.068
Mio. take Yasuyuki to a table.

93
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.196
- This way. please.
- Sure.

94
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:19.448
Enjoy!

95
00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.911
Here we go. best table in the house.

96
00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:28.540
- Thank you. that's very kind.
- And here is a menu for you.

97
00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.822
- Kinji.
- What's wrong?

98
00:14:23.864 --> 00:14:27.284
Some strange men just walked into the restaurant.
They want to talk to you.

99
00:14:27.326 --> 00:14:30.412
Why do they want to talk to me?
What do you mean?

100
00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:35.125
They said they wanted to talk to the boss
and will wait until we're finished.

101
00:14:35.167 --> 00:14:39.296
Who are they? What do they want?

102
00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:42.049
I have no idea who they are.

103
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:47.054
Don't worry. I'll talk to them.
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding...

104
00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:49.139
and they have the wrong place.

105
00:14:49.181 --> 00:14:53.018
It doesn't look like it!
They're drinking vodka.

106
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:58.148
Don't worry. Sakura. everything will be okay.
Let's finish the orders first.

107
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:02.986
As soon as we are done. take Mio home.
I will close up the restaurant. Okay?

108
00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:04.488
Okay.

109
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:09.076
Just make sure they leave and don't come back.

110
00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:13.163
- They are scaring our customers away.
- Understood.

111
00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:10.632
Have you done your homework?

112
00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:14.803
Yeah. but I haven't read the book
so I might get told off.

113
00:18:14.845 --> 00:18:19.433
You haven't read it? I'm sure you'll be fine.

114
00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:30.754
- Bye...
- Bye!

115
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:11.378
Right... I'm leaving.

116
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:16.508
Junpei. be a good boy.

117
00:20:18.969 --> 00:20:21.430
See you at the restaurant.

118
00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:27.728
I need to do a few things before we open.

119
00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:30.981
- Okay. See you later.
- Bye bye.

120
00:24:48.697 --> 00:24:52.910
Yasuyuki!
You're early!

121
00:24:52.951 --> 00:24:56.079
- The restaurant isn't open yet...
- No problem. Kinji.

122
00:24:56.121 --> 00:25:01.793
I was just passing by and thought
I would come to see you.

123
00:25:07.716 --> 00:25:09.635
Sorry to keep you waiting.

124
00:25:09.676 --> 00:25:12.804
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

125
00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:16.683
How are things with you?

126
00:25:16.725 --> 00:25:19.770
They are well. thank you.

127
00:25:19.811 --> 00:25:23.649
Masaki is really enjoying his new school.

128
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:25.442
That's great to hear.

129
00:25:25.484 --> 00:25:29.780
Maybe we can get our sons together again soon?

130
00:25:29.821 --> 00:25:34.826
I'm sure Masaki would like that.

131
00:25:36.495 --> 00:25:39.498
What about you? How's business going?

132
00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.251
The restaurant seems to be doing very well.

133
00:25:42.292 --> 00:25:47.589
Yes. it's going surprisingly well. thank you.

134
00:25:48.757 --> 00:25:50.133
But...

135
00:25:50.175 --> 00:25:56.014
But? Has something happened?

136
00:25:56.056 --> 00:26:00.811
I'm sure it's nothing. but...

137
00:26:00.853 --> 00:26:05.858
we had some trouble with a few Russian men.

138
00:26:05.899 --> 00:26:10.529
Yes. I saw them come in.
What did they want?

139
00:26:10.571 --> 00:26:12.865
Oh it's nothing really.

140
00:26:15.576 --> 00:26:18.120
I know it's not my business.

141
00:26:18.161 --> 00:26:23.125
but please let me know if there's anything I can help with.

142
00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:28.297
When the Russians came.
they must have wanted something?

143
00:26:28.338 --> 00:26:30.465
It was nothing really.

144
00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:37.139
I understand how important this restaurant is to you.

145
00:26:37.181 --> 00:26:42.102
I represent many businesses.

146
00:26:42.144 --> 00:26:48.358
So I know how the Russians operate in London.

147
00:26:50.152 --> 00:26:52.154
I see.

148
00:26:52.946 --> 00:26:58.202
You're a lawyer?

149
00:26:58.243 --> 00:27:01.413
Yes. I am.

150
00:27:03.832 --> 00:27:06.168
I see.

151
00:27:07.044 --> 00:27:11.840
I guess I'm still learning
how things operate in London.

152
00:27:11.882 --> 00:27:17.221
Would you be willing to help me in some way
with the restaurant?

153
00:27:18.096 --> 00:27:21.266
Of course.

154
00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:24.728
You can reach me anytime...

155
00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.272
and tell me how you think I can help.

156
00:27:27.314 --> 00:27:33.320
Thank you. I appreciate that.
But. not here.

157
00:27:33.362 --> 00:27:37.783
- My wife would start to worry if she heard us talk.
- That's okay.

158
00:27:37.824 --> 00:27:44.122
Just let me know where and when you want to talk.
I'll be there.

159
00:27:45.666 --> 00:27:49.419
My family means everything.

160
00:27:50.337 --> 00:27:59.763
Family is important.
You must always protect them first.

161
00:28:02.432 --> 00:28:04.852
Thank you.

162
00:28:06.103 --> 00:28:12.025
I must get back to preparing for lunch.
You are welcome to stay as long as you need.

163
00:32:23.235 --> 00:32:26.363
Sorry. it was Mio.

164
00:32:26.405 --> 00:32:30.117
I'm worried they are going to do something.

165
00:32:30.158 --> 00:32:35.205
Yasuyuki. I really need your help.

166
00:32:35.247 --> 00:32:38.083
I can't risk anything happening to my family.

167
00:32:38.125 --> 00:32:41.253
I think it might be a good idea for you
to join us for dinner

168
00:32:41.295 --> 00:32:46.925
and get to know my family.

169
00:32:47.885 --> 00:32:51.180
Would you do that Yasuyuki?

170
00:32:51.221 --> 00:32:54.183
Great. I will send you our address.

171
00:32:54.224 --> 00:32:56.518
See you soon.

172
00:33:08.655 --> 00:33:13.160
See you boss. thanks for tonight.

173
00:33:13.202 --> 00:33:16.788
I'll be back in next week.
I'm off on holiday tomorrow.

174
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:20.292
- Where are you off to again?
- Mexico. boss. Family re-union.

175
00:33:20.334 --> 00:33:24.004
Oh that's right. Mexico.
Well enjoy the Tequilas!

176
00:33:24.046 --> 00:33:27.341
Haha will do. Thanks boss.

177
00:33:27.382 --> 00:33:28.884
Thanks!

178
00:35:47.689 --> 00:35:50.442
Listen up. We must find him no matter what.

179
00:35:50.484 --> 00:35:52.986
- This is your mission. Understood?
- Yes. sir.

180
00:35:53.362 --> 00:35:55.489
- Boss.
- What is it?

181
00:35:55.531 --> 00:35:58.325
It's for you. boss.

182
00:35:58.742 --> 00:36:01.954
Yes. hello. what is it?

183
00:36:04.414 --> 00:36:10.546
Everybody out. Now!

184
00:36:13.674 --> 00:36:18.345
You've found him?
Where is he? London!?

185
00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:24.017
Which restaurant?

186
00:36:24.059 --> 00:36:27.688
I will send Kazuki to assist you.

187
00:36:27.729 --> 00:36:32.025
Make sure you return what is ours.
no matter what.

188
00:36:34.152 --> 00:36:38.323
Well done. you should be proud.

189
00:36:44.162 --> 00:36:48.458
Prepare Kazuki. Send him to London immediately.

190
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:52.254
Make sure he brings the device back.

191
00:36:52.296 --> 00:36:56.425
We have to finally put an end to this.

192
00:36:56.466 --> 00:37:01.555
- Kinji Suzuki must die.
- Understood.

193
00:37:09.396 --> 00:37:12.566
We've found him.

194
00:37:14.943 --> 00:37:18.447
Eat some vegetables too.

195
00:37:18.488 --> 00:37:21.366
You've really come a long way
with your cooking. Mio.

196
00:37:21.408 --> 00:37:23.285
Thanks for prearing dinner tonight.

197
00:37:23.327 --> 00:37:26.246
You haven't finished it yet. Mum!

198
00:37:26.288 --> 00:37:29.208
Besides. I've learned from the best.
haven't I. Dad?

199
00:37:29.249 --> 00:37:35.756
I'm not sure your father would consider
himself the best...

200
00:37:35.797 --> 00:37:39.343
Well. I think both of your cooking is delicious.

201
00:37:39.384 --> 00:37:46.975
I can definitely see you taking over
from your Dad one day.

202
00:37:49.728 --> 00:37:52.940
Mio. can you answer the door?

203
00:37:55.776 --> 00:37:59.112
- Would you like some?
- Thank you.

204
00:37:59.154 --> 00:38:04.493
Kinji?

205
00:38:05.118 --> 00:38:07.371
Cheers...

206
00:38:08.497 --> 00:38:10.541
Are you eating vegetables?

207
00:38:14.002 --> 00:38:16.296
- Hey everyone!
- Hello!

208
00:38:16.338 --> 00:38:17.631
Akiho's here.

209
00:38:17.673 --> 00:38:21.385
Did you cook this Mio?
Looks amazing!

210
00:38:21.426 --> 00:38:23.220
- Please join us.
- Thank you.

211
00:38:23.262 --> 00:38:27.182
Have some food.
Nice to see you.

212
00:38:28.308 --> 00:38:31.520
- How are your parents?
- They are fine.

213
00:38:31.562 --> 00:38:36.441
When did we see them last? 6 months ago?

214
00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.279
- I heard you moved?
- Yes. we have.

215
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.239
- Where to?
- Just nearby.

216
00:38:42.281 --> 00:38:46.451
Really?
How near? Walking distance?

217
00:38:46.493 --> 00:38:47.828
About 10 minutes.

218
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:50.330
Really? You should come by more.

219
00:38:50.372 --> 00:38:55.127
Mio didn't tell us.

220
00:38:57.045 --> 00:39:00.090
Mio. who's that man?

221
00:39:00.132 --> 00:39:04.303
Dad's new friend.
He often comes to the restaurant.

222
00:39:04.344 --> 00:39:08.640
Don't you think he's handsome?

223
00:39:08.682 --> 00:39:12.060
- Didn't know you like older men.
- Not like that. But he's very nice.

224
00:39:12.102 --> 00:39:15.814
- Who made this miso soup?
- Mio. She cooked it all.

225
00:39:15.856 --> 00:39:17.107
Except for the Nori seaweed...

226
00:39:17.149 --> 00:39:19.193
Yeah. the seaweed and the pickles.

227
00:39:19.234 --> 00:39:21.069
Isn't Mio's cooking great?

228
00:39:21.111 --> 00:39:23.113
You should ask her to cook again.

229
00:39:23.155 --> 00:39:25.449
Right. Mio?

230
00:39:27.409 --> 00:39:31.205
So Yakuyuki. tell us more about your work.

231
00:39:31.246 --> 00:39:36.710
Kinji tells me you're a lawyer?
How long have you been doing that?

232
00:39:36.752 --> 00:39:38.170
Let me think...

233
00:39:38.212 --> 00:39:42.424
Well I worked in this field for many years
back in Japan.

234
00:39:42.466 --> 00:39:45.511
So maybe around 15-20 years.

235
00:39:45.552 --> 00:39:51.266
Oh wow. you must be very experienced then.

236
00:39:53.852 --> 00:40:01.610
Yasuyuki is going to help our family business.
Make sure everything's in order for us.

237
00:40:01.652 --> 00:40:05.948
Really? Well we must be in very safe hands then.

238
00:40:08.116 --> 00:40:13.539
- Would you like some more?
- Thank you. I feel drunk now.

239
00:42:40.811 --> 00:42:43.105
Leave it!

240
00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:55.492
- Yasuyuki! So good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

241
00:42:55.534 --> 00:42:59.329
- I wanted to thank you for a lovely dinner.
- That's very sweet.

242
00:42:59.371 --> 00:43:03.667
Your cooking was delicious. Mio.

243
00:43:03.709 --> 00:43:07.379
Thank you. Yasuyuki.
Such beautiful flowers!

244
00:43:07.421 --> 00:43:12.009
It was so lovely to have you over.
you must join us again.

245
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.886
It would be my pleasure.

246
00:43:13.927 --> 00:43:17.931
- Maybe Junpei can cook next time!
- Maybe!

247
00:43:17.973 --> 00:43:20.976
Kinji should be here soon
if you wanted to say hello?

248
00:43:21.018 --> 00:43:24.271
That's okay. I have a few meetings to get to.

249
00:43:24.313 --> 00:43:26.982
Send him my regards. See you again soon.

250
00:43:27.024 --> 00:43:29.276
Thank you. I will do.

251
00:43:29.318 --> 00:43:32.321
We'll look forward to seeing you soon.

252
00:43:32.362 --> 00:43:35.991
- Thank you again for the flowers!
- You're welcome.

253
00:43:36.033 --> 00:43:38.160
Bye.

254
00:43:42.456 --> 00:43:44.082
- Look.
- They're beautiful.

255
00:43:44.124 --> 00:43:47.336
Why do you always get the flowers!

256
00:43:47.377 --> 00:43:50.297
I can't help being the best chef
in the family. Mum.

257
00:43:50.339 --> 00:43:52.758
Good for you.

258
00:48:40.128 --> 00:48:43.757
Yes. I'm making progress.

259
00:48:43.799 --> 00:48:47.761
However the people I'm working with
over here are useless.

260
00:48:47.803 --> 00:48:54.268
But rest assured. if they don't find him then I will.

261
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:56.478
Yes.

262
00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:01.400
I will update you at the end of each day until I do.

263
00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:12.536
- Kinji.
- Yasuyuki. Thanks for meeting me.

264
00:49:12.828 --> 00:49:17.040
I wasn't expecting your call so soon.
You sounded worried.

265
00:49:17.082 --> 00:49:20.002
Everything okay? You know I have an office...

266
00:49:20.043 --> 00:49:22.546
No. not in your office.

267
00:49:22.588 --> 00:49:26.675
I don't want anyone to know about this.
especially my family.

268
00:49:26.717 --> 00:49:31.555
Anyway. you said you could help?

269
00:49:31.597 --> 00:49:37.436
Of course. I can always help professionally.

270
00:49:37.477 --> 00:49:41.106
I don't think the law's going to help me.

271
00:49:41.148 --> 00:49:45.903
These men won't stop until they've bled my restaurant dry.

272
00:49:45.944 --> 00:49:50.115
I can't let them do this to my family.

273
00:49:50.157 --> 00:49:53.577
- I had to do something.
- Don't worry.

274
00:49:53.619 --> 00:49:57.497
I have contacts in many different areas.
I can help you.

275
00:50:02.461 --> 00:50:05.088
I need you to get me something.

276
00:50:08.759 --> 00:50:10.594
Okay.

277
00:50:10.636 --> 00:50:14.932
- Anything you need.
- Thank you.

278
01:05:40.691 --> 01:05:43.110
Here. take these bags and pack
whatever you need to.

279
01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:46.363
We need to leave right away.

280
01:05:52.286 --> 01:05:53.954
Quick. Hurry!

281
01:13:37.251 --> 01:13:40.087
Here...

282
01:13:45.676 --> 01:13:49.054
Thank you.

283
01:13:51.098 --> 01:13:54.476
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

284
01:13:54.518 --> 01:13:59.690
Everything's going to be just fine.
Don't you worry Junpei.

285
01:14:01.108 --> 01:14:04.570
Thank you for everything. Yasuyuki.

286
01:14:04.611 --> 01:14:08.115
Kinji told us to trust you.

287
01:14:08.156 --> 01:14:13.620
- I'm glad he has a friend like you.
- You're welcome.

288
01:14:14.621 --> 01:14:17.708
It's a dangerous city.

289
01:14:21.378 --> 01:14:24.631
We're all here for each other.

290
01:14:27.342 --> 01:14:32.806
Is this your house Yasuyuki?

291
01:16:50.986 --> 01:16:53.363
Kazuki...

292
01:16:53.947 --> 01:16:59.036
- How did you find me?
- You're not that hard to find. Kinji.

293
01:16:59.077 --> 01:17:02.247
You didn't think moving to the other side
of the world

294
01:17:02.289 --> 01:17:05.334
would prevent us from finding you. did you?

295
01:17:05.375 --> 01:17:08.337
- Give me that bag!
- What are you going to do with it?

296
01:17:08.378 --> 01:17:11.256
You can't release it. no one would...

297
01:17:11.298 --> 01:17:16.428
We'll decide what's best for it.
It was never yours to take. Kinji.

298
01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:01.630
Yasuyuki! Are they okay?

299
01:22:03.882 --> 01:22:06.009
Thank god.

300
01:22:06.051 --> 01:22:09.972
Thank you. Thank you!

301
01:22:10.472 --> 01:22:13.392
I'll be there as soon as I can.

302
01:22:59.354 --> 01:23:01.773
- Kinji!
- Sakura!

303
01:23:01.815 --> 01:23:03.859
Yasuyuki!

304
01:23:04.902 --> 01:23:07.487
What are you doing!?
Put that gun down!

305
01:23:07.529 --> 01:23:09.865
Sakura. are you okay?

306
01:23:09.907 --> 01:23:11.909
Where is Junpei and Mio!?

307
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:14.286
Kinji...

308
01:23:14.953 --> 01:23:18.040
Where's the device?

309
01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:22.127
What device?

310
01:23:22.169 --> 01:23:24.171
Don't play dumb Kinji!

311
01:23:25.923 --> 01:23:29.760
I saw you put it in your backpack at the restaurant.

312
01:23:29.801 --> 01:23:32.221
If you don't give it to me...

313
01:23:34.264 --> 01:23:35.891
No. no!

314
01:23:35.933 --> 01:23:39.102
Leave Sakura out of this! She's done nothing.

315
01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:44.608
The backpack Kinji. I'm running out of patience.

316
01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:49.279
Look. I don't have it anymore! Vincent has it.

317
01:23:49.321 --> 01:23:53.325
He took it from me after he killed the Russians!

318
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:56.453
When?

319
01:23:57.162 --> 01:24:01.166
Before I got here!
I led them all to a warehouse.

320
01:24:01.208 --> 01:24:05.170
Why are you doing this Yasuyuki?
I trusted you...

321
01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:09.716
Well. you were mistaken.

322
01:24:09.758 --> 01:24:16.890
Give me that backpack
or your wife and kids will die.

323
01:24:16.932 --> 01:24:18.809
No!

324
01:24:20.519 --> 01:24:24.189
Where is Junpei. Mio?

325
01:24:25.190 --> 01:24:28.360
They are tied up somewhere safe. for now.

326
01:24:31.613 --> 01:24:34.867
How did you know about the backpack?

327
01:24:35.993 --> 01:24:42.958
Didn't they teach you anything
in government intelligence?

328
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.921
I've been watching you all of this time. Kinji.

329
01:25:06.982 --> 01:25:10.402
The night the Russians first came to your restaurant.

330
01:25:32.674 --> 01:25:36.845
And who do you think sent Kazuki to find you.

331
01:25:37.846 --> 01:25:41.266
You didn't think Hideshi would just let you go.
did you Kinji?

332
01:25:41.308 --> 01:25:44.978
Make sure you return what is ours.
no matter what.

333
01:25:46.897 --> 01:25:50.359
Well done. you should be proud.

334
01:26:05.624 --> 01:26:10.504
You've been playing me this whole time?
Ever since...

335
01:26:12.005 --> 01:26:15.759
Yes Kinji. ever since I first found you here in London.

336
01:26:17.344 --> 01:26:21.682
- Well done for finally working it out.
- Stop.

337
01:26:21.723 --> 01:26:25.811
I have it. It's in the back of my car.

338
01:26:26.395 --> 01:26:32.192
I have to go outside to get it for you...
just leave my family alone.

339
01:26:32.234 --> 01:26:38.699
Not so fast. Kinji. you will lead me to it.
I'm not that stupid.

340
01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.492
Okay.

341
01:26:40.534 --> 01:26:47.749
- Please!
- Shut up! I'm talking. Bring me to it now!

342
01:26:54.965 --> 01:26:57.467
This way.

343
01:27:00.262 --> 01:27:01.763
- Where is it?
- Over there.

344
01:27:01.805 --> 01:27:04.349
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

345
01:27:07.227 --> 01:27:10.272
It's inside the boot.

346
01:27:10.898 --> 01:27:13.609
Hurry! Hurry up!

347
01:27:13.650 --> 01:27:15.944
- It's inside the boot.
- Hurry up!

348
01:27:16.486 --> 01:27:18.488
Okay.

349
01:27:26.246 --> 01:27:30.167
Now let Sakura go and you can have the backpack.

350
01:27:33.253 --> 01:27:35.797
I don't think you're in a position
to be making demands.

351
01:27:35.839 --> 01:27:38.759
Oh yeah. how about now...

352
01:27:40.344 --> 01:27:44.056
Stop!
One more move and I destroy the device.

353
01:27:44.097 --> 01:27:46.225
If you don't believe me. you are welcome to try.

354
01:27:46.266 --> 01:27:49.978
Let Sakura go and you can have the backpack.

355
01:27:51.313 --> 01:27:53.857
I don't believe you. You would never...

356
01:27:53.899 --> 01:27:58.904
Yasuyuki. whatever's inside doesn't mean
as much to me as my family.

357
01:27:59.988 --> 01:28:04.451
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes
to make sure they are safe.

358
01:28:10.082 --> 01:28:12.543
Sakura!
Sakura. are you okay?

359
01:28:36.233 --> 01:28:43.282
I'm so sorry.
I never meant to put you through any of this.

360
01:28:43.323 --> 01:28:46.451
Mio. Junpei!

361
01:28:46.493 --> 01:28:48.996
Are you okay?

362
01:29:01.466 --> 01:29:04.136
Junpei! Mio!

363
01:31:30.490 --> 01:31:32.451
Kinji!
