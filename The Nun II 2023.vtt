Every day she's making trouble.

56
00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:51.076
And now. she refused
to go to confession.

57
00:07:51.211 --> 00:07:53.807
[speaks Italian]

58
00:07:53.943 --> 00:07:55.572
[in English] And you know why?

59
00:07:55.707 --> 00:07:59.750
She did not think
she had anything to confess.

60
00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:02.787
For that alone.
she should be confessing.

61
00:08:02.922 --> 00:08:04.585
I will have a talk with her.
Reverend Mother.

62
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:06.021

63
00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:18.033
Sister Debra?

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.574
Sister Irene.

65
00:08:21.936 --> 00:08:23.577
This about confession?

66
00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.106
You're going to give the Mother
a heart attack.

67
00:08:25.242 --> 00:08:27.581
Well. then maybe
I'll have something to confess.

68
00:08:30.118 --> 00:08:31.783
[stifles laugh]

69
00:08:38.055 --> 00:08:39.560
Your father
sent you here. right?

70
00:08:41.725 --> 00:08:44.525
Yes. I was different.

71
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.162
Sending me away was easier than
trying to understand who I was.

72
00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:51.671
What'd your mama
say about that?

73
00:08:57.906 --> 00:08:59.239
I barely remember her.

74
00:09:00.981 --> 00:09:03.177
But my father always said
I was just like her.

75
00:09:05.677 --> 00:09:07.247
I don't think he meant it
as a compliment.

76
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.662
Well. my family's
from Mississippi.

77
00:09:15.797 --> 00:09:18.128
but we ran into some trouble
down there.

78
00:09:18.264 --> 00:09:21.531
When I was four. white folks.
they found where we were.

79
00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:22.867
burned our house down.

80
00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:27.806
After that.
my brothers joined the army.

81
00:09:27.941 --> 00:09:30.970
My dad figured.
"My boys can serve country.

82
00:09:31.105 --> 00:09:33.306
my daughter can serve God."

83
00:09:34.882 --> 00:09:36.479
Never in my wildest dreams
did I think

84
00:09:36.615 --> 00:09:38.146
I was gonna end up here.

85
00:09:41.855 --> 00:09:43.723
Do I still have
to go to confession?

86
00:09:46.121 --> 00:09:47.694
I think
you've confessed enough.

87
00:09:49.563 --> 00:09:50.762
[elder sister] One by one.

88
00:09:50.898 --> 00:09:54.063
the sisters
found themselves murdered.

89
00:09:54.198 --> 00:09:58.863
Hanging from windows.
Throats slit open.

90
00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:00.934
Acts of suicide.

91
00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:03.534
[whispers] Sometimes worse.

92
00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:06.708
They learned
that beneath their remote abbey

93
00:10:06.843 --> 00:10:09.842
was a terrible secret.

94
00:10:09.977 --> 00:10:12.719
A gateway to hell.

95
00:10:12.854 --> 00:10:17.889
And from this gateway.
a demon had escaped.

96
00:10:19.928 --> 00:10:23.126
Now. we know that a demon
can take any form.

97
00:10:23.261 --> 00:10:27.565
but they choose their form
to challenge your faith

98
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.736
and to weaken your spirits.

99
00:10:31.706 --> 00:10:35.872
Now. for the nuns
of Saint Carta.

100
00:10:36.007 --> 00:10:40.038
this demon
chose the most ungodly.

101
00:10:40.174 --> 00:10:43.814
the most blasphemous form.

102
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.413
It chose
to look like one of them.

103
00:10:49.119 --> 00:10:51.055
[Sister Debra]
And then what happened?

104
00:10:51.191 --> 00:10:54.722
Well. the Vatican sent in
a pair of demon hunters.

105
00:10:54.858 --> 00:10:59.064
A priest and a nun.

106
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.929
-And how did they stop it?
-[elder sister] Great question.

107
00:11:02.064 --> 00:11:04.761
They used an ancient relic.

108
00:11:04.896 --> 00:11:11.603
a vial which contained
the blood of Jesus Christ.

109
00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:15.810
So. they returned as heroes.
kissed the Pope's ring.

110
00:11:15.946 --> 00:11:18.608
Priest was made a bishop.

111
00:11:18.743 --> 00:11:20.952
[sister 2]
What happened to the nun?

112
00:11:21.087 --> 00:11:23.415
[elder sister]
Well. no one really knows.

113
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.254
They say the experience
was too much for her.

114
00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:30.753
Some say that she went mad.

115
00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:34.427
The Vatican had to lock her up
in an asylum.

116
00:11:49.341 --> 00:11:52.047
[Celeste] Gotcha! Quick!

117
00:11:52.182 --> 00:11:53.983
Why does Madame
have so much wine?

118
00:11:54.118 --> 00:11:55.213
[girl] This used
to be a monastery.

119
00:11:55.349 --> 00:11:57.023
The monks were all fat drunks.

120
00:11:57.159 --> 00:11:58.253

[Celeste] I got 'em.

127
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.450

149
00:14:06.814 --> 00:14:09.586
I made this for you.
It's a friendship bracelet.

150
00:14:09.822 --> 00:14:10.956

151
00:14:11.092 --> 00:14:12.287
a different quality
of a good friend.

152

-Give it back.
-You can't make me.

156
00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:28.271
You're not a teacher.
You're the servant.

157
00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:39.943
Even the servant knows

158
00:14:40.078 --> 00:14:43.389
you should treat everyone
with kindness and respect.

159
00:14:43.524 --> 00:14:45.090

There was a cockroach

Ah. that's unfortunate.

166
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.304
It's an infestation.
It's disgusting.

167
00:15:05.439 --> 00:15:08.143
I'll tend to it right away.

168

You have a visitor.

201
00:19:53.834 --> 00:19:55.235

You're fine. You're fine.

[Abbess] Sister Irene.

Your Eminence.

215
00:21:31.522 --> 00:21:33.366
[Cardinal Conroy]
There has been an incident.

216
00:21:34.364 --> 00:21:36.533
A series of them.

217
00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:40.266
Szeleste. a small village
in Hungary.

218
00:21:40.401 --> 00:21:43.776
A 90-year-old nun shot herself
on the steps of her church.

219
00:21:43.912 --> 00:21:45.873
Graz. Austria.

220
00:21:46.008 --> 00:21:48.211
A priest cut his throat open
with a rosary

221
00:21:48.346 --> 00:21:49.815
during Christmas mass.

222
00:21:49.951 --> 00:21:51.307
Edolo. Italy.

223
00:21:51.442 --> 00:21:54.545
A novitiate threw herself
out a window.

224
00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.718
Sound familiar?

225
00:21:56.854 --> 00:21:59.458
Just a month ago.
in Tarascon. France.

226
00:21:59.593 --> 00:22:01.926
another priest.
murdered inside his church.

227
00:22:02.061 --> 00:22:03.727
Immolated.

228
00:22:03.862 --> 00:22:07.662
Notice a pattern?
It's moving west across Europe.

229
00:22:07.798 --> 00:22:09.895
But its origins point
to Romania.

230
00:22:10.031 --> 00:22:13.635
-It can't be.
-The demon lives.

231
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:14.941
Have you spoken
with Father Burke?

232
00:22:15.076 --> 00:22:16.640
Father Burke is dead.

233
00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.777
-How?
-Cholera.

234
00:22:20.912 --> 00:22:22.448
[Cardinal Conroy] You are
the only person alive

235
00:22:22.583 --> 00:22:24.407
who has dealt
with something like this.

236
00:22:24.543 --> 00:22:27.586
The Church would like
<i> you</i> to investigate.

237
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:31.820
Find out what it wants
and where it's going next.

238
00:22:32.794 --> 00:22:33.723
No.

239
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:37.092
I'm sorry?

240
00:22:37.328 --> 00:22:39.430
I said. "No."

241
00:22:39.565 --> 00:22:41.599
-I can't do it.
-Can't. or won't?

242
00:22:41.734 --> 00:22:44.633
You don't know what happened
at Saint Carta.

243
00:22:44.769 --> 00:22:46.430
I was lucky
to make it out alive.

244
00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:49.432
You're right. I don't know
what you faced back there.

245
00:22:49.567 --> 00:22:53.606
But in that abbey. Sister.
you performed a miracle.

246
00:22:53.742 --> 00:22:55.646
The Church needs another.

247
00:23:05.685 --> 00:23:07.592
[whistle blows]

248
00:23:11.527 --> 00:23:13.598
[breath exhaling]

249
00:23:15.636 --> 00:23:17.129
-[Sister Debra] Here you are.
-Sister?

250
00:23:17.364 --> 00:23:19.367
Was afraid I almost hopped
on the wrong train.

251
00:23:19.503 --> 00:23:20.797
What are you doing here?

252
00:23:20.932 --> 00:23:22.641
Looking after you.

253
00:23:22.776 --> 00:23:25.005
-Someone's gotta.
-Sister. you could be expelled.

254
00:23:25.937 --> 00:23:27.106
Why are you here?

255
00:23:35.813 --> 00:23:36.786
My mama.

256
00:23:38.456 --> 00:23:40.025
She died in the fire.

257
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.791
She was my church.

258
00:23:43.793 --> 00:23:46.728
I want to believe in miracles.

259
00:23:46.863 --> 00:23:48.491
But when I see
the priest stand up

260
00:23:48.626 --> 00:23:51.029
and say he turned the wine
into the blood of Christ.

261
00:23:51.165 --> 00:23:53.534
I mean.
it's kind of hard to believe.

262
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:54.935
It's an act of faith.

263
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:57.369
He just says a bunch
of words to wine.

264
00:23:57.505 --> 00:24:01.580
The wine becomes the blood
of Christ because we believe.

265
00:24:01.715 --> 00:24:03.439
The most extraordinary
parts of our faith

266
00:24:03.574 --> 00:24:05.716
are only real
because we believe in them.

267
00:24:07.747 --> 00:24:08.851
I guess so.

268
00:24:10.718 --> 00:24:11.821
You're not ready.

269
00:24:12.553 --> 00:24:13.923
Why?

270
00:24:14.058 --> 00:24:17.025
An entire convent of nuns died
facing this thing.

271
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.924
Women who dedicated
their lives to their faith.

272
00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:21.567
Then sacrificed their lives

273
00:24:21.703 --> 00:24:22.931
because they believed
in something greater.

274
00:24:24.665 --> 00:24:25.736
You need me.

275
00:24:29.734 --> 00:24:32.171
I just hope you can find
your faith when the time comes.

276
00:24:40.177 --> 00:24:42.181
[church bell tolling]

277
00:24:48.226 --> 00:24:50.553
[Sophie] "Why. get you gone.
Who is't that hinders you?"

278
00:24:50.688 --> 00:24:52.595
[Kate] "A foolish heart
that I leave here behind."

279
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.230
[Sophie] "What. with Lysander?"

280
00:24:54.465 --> 00:24:55.899
"With Demetrius."

281
00:24:56.035 --> 00:24:58.837
"Be not afraid. She shall not
harm thee. Helena."

282
00:24:58.973 --> 00:25:02.574
[girl] "No. sir. she shall not.
though you take her part."

283
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:06.676
"O. when she is angry.
she is keen and shrewd.

284
00:25:06.812 --> 00:25:09.010
She was a vixen
when she went to school.

285
00:25:09.145 --> 00:25:12.447
And though she be but little.
she is fierce."

286
00:25:12.583 --> 00:25:14.083
[girl 2] "Little again!

287
00:25:14.219 --> 00:25:18.084
Nothing but low and little!
Why will you suffer her--"

288
00:25:18.219 --> 00:25:20.824
Uh. let's take a break.
Fifteen minutes.

289
00:25:20.959 --> 00:25:22.923
[girl 2] I was just getting
into character.

290
00:25:23.058 --> 00:25:25.827
[girl 3] Yeah.
an awful character.

291
00:25:25.963 --> 00:25:27.692
[Kate] All right. girls.
Slowly. now.

292
00:25:27.827 --> 00:25:28.963
[Maurice] Girls.

293
00:25:29.099 --> 00:25:31.065
Sweetheart.
take these to the office.

294
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:38.138
[whispering] You're the best.

295
00:25:42.245 --> 00:25:44.584
I heard there was
a faulty cabinet in the area?

296
00:25:46.243 --> 00:25:47.813
The latch won't open.

297
00:25:47.949 --> 00:25:49.281
-May I?
-Oh. please.

298
00:25:56.186 --> 00:25:57.862
Yeah. It's stuck.

299
00:25:57.998 --> 00:26:01.066
Can you just. please.
put a little pressure here?

300
00:26:01.201 --> 00:26:03.196
Yeah. Just here.

301
00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:05.869
All right. Thanks.

302
00:26:09.271 --> 00:26:11.270
Looks like we share
the latest fashion.

303
00:26:14.105 --> 00:26:15.109
I guess we do.

304
00:26:15.841 --> 00:26:16.880
Okay.

305
00:26:22.717 --> 00:26:23.788
[Kate] Oh!

306
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:26.686
Voila!

307
00:26:26.821 --> 00:26:28.093
Thanks a million.

308
00:26:28.228 --> 00:26:29.288
All right.

309
00:26:30.955 --> 00:26:32.060
Okay.

310
00:26:35.703 --> 00:26:39.133
She's a great kid.
You must be proud.

311
00:26:40.338 --> 00:26:41.641
I am.

312
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:01.155
Need some help?

313
00:27:02.989 --> 00:27:04.927
No. I'm okay.

314
00:27:05.063 --> 00:27:08.030
Relax. Sophie.
We're not going to do anything.

315
00:27:09.665 --> 00:27:10.670
Cross my heart.

316
00:27:13.202 --> 00:27:16.705
That was pretty mean
of us earlier.

317
00:27:16.841 --> 00:27:18.942
-I was a bitch.
-[girls laugh]

318
00:27:22.183 --> 00:27:23.078
It's okay.

319
00:27:24.244 --> 00:27:25.978
What are you doing after this?

320
00:27:26.113 --> 00:27:27.980
We have to go back to class.

321
00:27:28.115 --> 00:27:29.949
Not for another ten minutes.

322
00:27:30.085 --> 00:27:31.856
Do you want to have some fun?

323
00:27:33.757 --> 00:27:35.761
[indistinct chatter]

324
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.236
Madame says
the chapel is off limits.

325
00:27:45.371 --> 00:27:46.398
[Simone] I know.

329
00:28:59.814 --> 00:29:02.910
-What are we doing here?
-Playing a game.

330
00:29:03.046 --> 00:29:06.115
It's called "Defy the Devil."

331
00:29:07.953 --> 00:29:11.186
-I don't see any devil.
-[girls scoff]

332
00:29:12.384 --> 00:29:14.683
The Devil is always here.

333
00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:17.192
You're just not looking
carefully enough.

334
00:29:20.958 --> 00:29:26.300
It depends on where you stand
and when you look.

335
00:29:28.202 --> 00:29:30.876
At the right time of day...

336
00:29:31.011 --> 00:29:36.011
the sun hits the glass
at just the right angle.

337
00:29:36.147 --> 00:29:38.515
And if you're watching
carefully.

338
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.347
he looks right at you.

339
00:29:41.986 --> 00:29:44.914
The rumor is. if you look away.

340
00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:50.060
the Devil will appear in
the form of a monstrous goat.

341
00:29:56.167 --> 00:29:58.904
[whispering] See?
He's watching you.

342
00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:02.902
Whatever you do.

343
00:30:03.037 --> 00:30:05.376
whatever you hear.

344
00:30:05.511 --> 00:30:07.374
don't look away.

What happened?

00:32:09.328 --> 00:32:10.827
What happened?

364
00:32:10.963 --> 00:32:13.163
Of course. her boyfriend comes
to her rescue.

365
00:32:13.299 --> 00:32:14.567
[girls laugh]

366
00:32:16.908 --> 00:32:18.307
Do you think it's funny?

367
00:32:21.141 --> 00:32:22.179
[yells] Do you?

368
00:32:31.989 --> 00:32:34.994
It's okay. It's over.

369
00:32:37.995 --> 00:32:39.328
What happened in there?

370
00:32:40.666 --> 00:32:42.034
You can tell me.

371
00:32:45.367 --> 00:32:47.006
-Nothing.
-[Kate] Sophie?

372
00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.907
Why aren't you in class?

373
00:32:52.043 --> 00:32:53.538
Oh. this isn't her fault.

374
00:32:53.674 --> 00:32:55.205
The older girls
were playing some--

375
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.543
I'm sorry. Mom.

376
00:32:58.376 --> 00:32:59.447
Excuse us.

377
00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:01.916
[Maurice] Sure.

378
00:33:02.051 --> 00:33:03.187
Are you all right?

379
00:33:19.104 --> 00:33:20.268
[Sister Irene] Sister Astrid?

380
00:33:20.404 --> 00:33:21.330
[Sister Astrid]
Welcome to Tarascon.

381
00:33:21.465 --> 00:33:23.766
Please come in.

382
00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:27.307
We still have mass.
but no one comes.

383
00:33:27.443 --> 00:33:29.775
People believe
it was the Devil.

384
00:33:30.044 --> 00:33:34.548
They say our church is cursed.
that God has abandoned us.

385
00:33:48.627 --> 00:33:49.996
This is where we found him.

386
00:33:50.131 --> 00:33:52.104
[breath exhales]

387
00:33:54.171 --> 00:33:56.801

[Sister Debra] Sister?

393
00:35:08.375 --> 00:35:09.511
Are you okay?

394
00:35:12.213 --> 00:35:13.251
I'm fine.

395
00:35:17.756 --> 00:35:19.752
[Sister Debra] Can we see
Father Noiret's room. please?

396
00:35:21.489 --> 00:35:22.557
[Sister Astrid] Of course.

397
00:35:31.572 --> 00:35:32.501
Creepy.

398
00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:35.103
[Sister Irene] Saint Lucy.

399
00:35:35.239 --> 00:35:37.205
Patron Saint of the blind.

400
00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.639
She was murdered by pagans.

401
00:35:38.775 --> 00:35:40.642
They lit her on fire.
but she wouldn't burn.

402
00:35:40.777 --> 00:35:43.142
Before killing her.
they gouged out her eyes.

403
00:35:43.278 --> 00:35:44.573
[keys rattle]

404
00:35:44.709 --> 00:35:47.252
Found them. Please.

405
00:35:49.415 --> 00:35:50.717
[lock turns]

406
00:35:55.688 --> 00:35:57.691
[traffic rumbling outside]

407
00:36:00.257 --> 00:36:02.661
There was a boy that night?
A witness?

408
00:36:02.797 --> 00:36:05.402
Yes. Jacques.
He saw everything.

409
00:36:06.533 --> 00:36:07.768
Where can we find him?

410
00:36:07.903 --> 00:36:10.374
His mother doesn't want him
talking about it.

411
00:36:11.775 --> 00:36:14.640
But you might find him
playing football in town.

412
00:36:14.776 --> 00:36:16.748
Was there anyone else
in the church?

413
00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:18.413
We had a handyman.

414
00:36:18.548 --> 00:36:20.511
He left the day
after it happened.

415
00:36:20.647 --> 00:36:22.412
Do you know where he went?

416
00:36:22.548 --> 00:36:24.587
I don't know.

417
00:36:24.723 --> 00:36:28.192
But he was a world traveler.
He came from Romania.

418
00:36:28.328 --> 00:36:30.091
That is where he got
his nickname.

419
00:36:30.227 --> 00:36:32.425
They used to call him...

420
00:36:32.561 --> 00:36:33.925
-"Frenchie."
-Frenchie.

421
00:36:36.326 --> 00:36:37.929
[Sister Irene] Where are you
headed next?

422
00:36:38.164 --> 00:36:40.501
Well. I have enough money
to get me to Hungary.

423
00:36:40.637 --> 00:36:42.802
and from there.
the world is my oyster.

424
00:36:44.274 --> 00:36:46.168
At least Hungary is.

425
00:36:46.303 --> 00:36:49.371
-You saved my life.
-That? That was nothing.

426
00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:52.979
No. you've just fell into a...
what do you call it? Um...

427
00:36:53.248 --> 00:36:54.418
a life debt.

428
00:36:55.185 --> 00:36:56.619
It's very simple.

429
00:36:56.754 --> 00:36:59.918
You and I will be bound
together for all eternity.

430
00:37:02.424 --> 00:37:03.520

432
00:37:05.297 --> 00:37:06.559
[Sister Irene] I almost forgot.

433
00:37:06.694 --> 00:37:09.532
It's nothing. just a thank you.

434
00:37:13.501 --> 00:37:15.801
Tomato seeds. Thank you.

435
00:37:15.936 --> 00:37:18.207
You said you wanted a farm
some day.

436
00:37:18.342 --> 00:37:19.608
You have to start somewhere.

437
00:37:21.876 --> 00:37:24.640
-I'll miss you. Irene.
-[whistle blows]

438

[conductor shouting]

439
00:37:39.659 --> 00:37:40.629
[Sister Debra] Irene?

440
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:44.336
Who is this Frenchie guy?

441
00:37:46.402 --> 00:37:48.570
His name is Maurice.

442
00:37:48.706 --> 00:37:50.837
Back at Saint Carta.
he was our guide.

443
00:37:50.972 --> 00:37:55.314
When I faced the demon.
he came back for me.

444
00:37:58.381 --> 00:37:59.549
<i> He saved my life.</i>

445
00:38:02.356 --> 00:38:04.723
[gasps] That's when
it happened.

[screams]

447
00:38:09.756 --> 00:38:12.054
It's how the demon escaped.

448
00:38:12.323 --> 00:38:15.263
That's how it's moving.
doing these things.

449
00:38:15.398 --> 00:38:17.600
So. he's... possessed.

450
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.704
[indistinct shouting]

451
00:38:28.409 --> 00:38:29.073
[Kate] Maurice.

452
00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:32.846
Hi. Hello again.

453
00:38:34.585 --> 00:38:37.212
I realized
I never said thank you.

454
00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:39.620
-Sophie told me what you did.
-Oh. No.

455
00:38:39.756 --> 00:38:42.457
Those girls
are little monsters.

456
00:38:42.592 --> 00:38:45.694
They're not all bad. Just some.

457
00:38:50.529 --> 00:38:53.905
Look... the chapel. why does
Madame keep it locked up?

458
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:56.607
Uh. it's dangerous.

459
00:38:56.742 --> 00:38:59.543
Her son was killed inside
during the bombings.

460
00:39:00.906 --> 00:39:03.107
Cedric. He was an altar boy.

461
00:39:04.547 --> 00:39:06.248
I didn't know she had a son.

462
00:39:06.384 --> 00:39:07.915
She doesn't talk about it.

463
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:11.918
Madame is a hard woman.
but she's been very good to us.

464
00:39:18.565 --> 00:39:21.631
Ah. I should get back
to the children.

465
00:39:21.766 --> 00:39:24.403
Sure. yes. And I should
get back to my work.

466
00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:31.938

467
00:39:45.123 --> 00:39:46.425

-You were spying.

470
00:39:53.594 --> 00:39:55.828
-Maybe.
-Maybe?

471
00:39:55.964 --> 00:39:58.629
Maybe. probably.
absolutely definitely.

473
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:04.036
-What were you talking about?
-Nothing.

474
00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:07.842
It was something.
He was making you laugh.

475
00:40:09.041 --> 00:40:10.845
That is none of your business.

476
00:40:12.484 --> 00:40:15.619
Now. let's go. No more spying.

You sense something?

it would be unthinkable.

But in your hands.
it could be a weapon.

of Christ at Saint Carta.
