Ooh. Ooh-la-la.

4
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.601
Illumination!

5
00:00:33.636 --> 00:00:36.802
<i>And now for a bedtime story.</i>

00:00:38.377 --> 00:00:39.937
- ♪ ♪

7
00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:43.512
<i>Once upon a time.
there was a beautiful pond.</i>

8
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.119
<i>It was paradise.</i>

9
00:00:46.154 --> 00:00:49.485
<i>- Everyone was happy there.</i>

10
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.719
<i>Well. not everyone.</i>

11
00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:54.589
<i>For two ducklings
were suffering</i>

12
00:00:54.624 --> 00:00:57.053
<i>from a strange condition.</i>

13
00:00:57.088 --> 00:00:59.132
<i>They were bored.</i>

14
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.367
<i>And they were eager to
discover what lay beyond</i>

15
00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:05.369
<i>their cozy little pond.</i>

16
00:01:05.404 --> 00:01:06.964
Come on. Let's have a look.

17
00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:09.439
But Daddy says it's dangerous
to leave the pond.

18
00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:11.210
We're brave and strong.

19
00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:12.739
We ain't scared of nothing.

20
00:01:12.774 --> 00:01:15.709
<i>So they decided to go for it.</i>

21
00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:18.415
<i>- straight into the arms of...</i>

22
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.615
<i>predators!</i>

23
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.228
<i>- They were
surrounded. trapped.</i>

24
00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:30.856
<i>But the ducklings
were not afraid.</i>

25
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:34.959
<i>The tiny heroes attacked
the predator. and...</i>

26
00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.664
they died.

27
00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:38.402
The end.

28
00:01:39.438 --> 00:01:42.208
Uh. that's all? They're dead?

29
00:01:42.243 --> 00:01:44.034
Oh. yeah. No survivors.

30
00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.244
But how?

31
00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:46.641
Oh. you want details? Okay.

32
00:01:46.676 --> 00:01:48.280
So. first.
the heron cut them in half...

33
00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:49.545
Oh. whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa.

34
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.547
Wait a second here.

35
00:01:51.582 --> 00:01:54.110
Your father got
the story wrong-- again.

36
00:01:54.145 --> 00:01:55.584
What really happened was:

37
00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.553
<i>The heron saw
that they were lost.</i>

38
00:01:57.588 --> 00:01:59.357
<i>so she offered to help them.</i>

39
00:01:59.392 --> 00:02:01.084
<i>Pam. it's a heron.</i>

40
00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.395
<i>A psycho killer
designed to eat ducklings.</i>

41
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.858
<i>All right. fine.</i>

42
00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:07.794
<i>The heron was about
to eat them.</i>

43
00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.633
<i>But their parents arrived
just in time and saved them.</i>

44
00:02:11.668 --> 00:02:13.635
<i>Oh. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no.</i>

45
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.001
<i>Their parents arrived.
but it was too late.</i>

46
00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:18.475
Oh. Dax. don't worry.

47
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.708
It's going to be okay.

48
00:02:20.743 --> 00:02:22.105
Really. Dad?

49
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.612
Yeah. sure.

50
00:02:23.647 --> 00:02:25.944
Squished ducks. they can
achieve great things. too.

51
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.451
As long as they stay in the pond

52
00:02:27.486 --> 00:02:29.222
far from the dangers
of the world.

53
00:02:29.257 --> 00:02:31.587
such as herons
and bears and wolves

54
00:02:31.622 --> 00:02:33.820
and storms and cyclones

55
00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:36.889
and tornadoes and crocodiles
and poisonous mushrooms...

56
00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:39.463
Okay. I really need
to get to bed now.

57
00:02:39.498 --> 00:02:41.234
...and saber-toothed tigers...

58
00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.730
What happened to
the other duckling?

59
00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:44.996
- Was she squished. too?
Oh. no. no. no.

60
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.371
Don't worry. Gwen.

61
00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:47.966
The ducklings were both safe.

62
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.770
They just went on their way
right back to the pond.

63
00:02:49.805 --> 00:02:51.871
But another predator
came in and...

64
00:02:51.906 --> 00:02:54.313
And wished them good day.

65
00:02:54.348 --> 00:02:56.172
-  The end.

66
00:02:56.207 --> 00:02:57.811
- That's it.

67
00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:01.144
Okay.

68
00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:03.718
Good night. Mom.

69
00:03:03.753 --> 00:03:05.918
- Good night. Dad.
- Good night.

70
00:03:07.592 --> 00:03:09.152
- What?

71
00:03:09.187 --> 00:03:12.694
Every time you tell a story.
Gwen wets her twig bed.

72
00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:14.333
Does she? That's great.

73
00:03:14.368 --> 00:03:16.566
See? That means
she's learning. Pam.

74
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:17.963
Oh. learning what?

75
00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:19.998
That she should never
leave the pond?

76
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.571
Exactly.

77
00:03:21.606 --> 00:03:23.507
Trust me. I'm teaching her
very valuable fears.

78
00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:26.873
I should know. I've lived
with them my entire life.

79
00:03:28.206 --> 00:03:31.075
So have we all.

80
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.912
Good night. honey.

81
00:03:34.212 --> 00:03:36.179
Good night. sweetheart.

82
00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:01.237
Ready. set. go!

83
00:04:01.272 --> 00:04:02.843
Come on. Gwenny! Come on!

84
00:04:02.878 --> 00:04:04.911
Let's go. Let's go.
Beat Daddy. Beat Daddy.

85
00:04:04.946 --> 00:04:07.078
Go. go. go. go! Oh. yay!

86
00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:08.420
- Yes!
- Aw. I lost.

87
00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:11.753
Whoo! Yes!

88
00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:14.855
- Whoo...

89
00:04:16.287 --> 00:04:18.023
- Hey.
- Huh?

90
00:04:19.323 --> 00:04:20.828
- Hello!

91
00:04:20.863 --> 00:04:21.730
Huh?

92
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.009
- Yay!

93
00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:38.714
- Mine!
- You're the worst!

94
00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:40.650
- That's mine!
- Got a thousand of 'em!

95
00:04:40.685 --> 00:04:42.421
- Whoa.
- Thanks. Dad!

96
00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:44.852
Whoa!

97
00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.292
Okay. guys.

98
00:04:56.327 --> 00:04:58.327
Remember to pick
the fresh leaves.

99
00:04:58.362 --> 00:04:59.999
Okay. Dad.

100
00:05:00.034 --> 00:05:01.330
Is this one good. Dad?

101
00:05:01.365 --> 00:05:02.408
Perfect.

102
00:05:02.443 --> 00:05:04.509
Keep looking for more.

103
00:05:10.242 --> 00:05:11.714
Guys!

104
00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:13.045
Guys. you have to see something.

105
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.651
It's incredible.
Come on. come on.

106
00:05:14.686 --> 00:05:16.818
Everybody. come. Come on.

107
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.498
Whoo! Oh. look!

108
00:05:26.533 --> 00:05:28.731
- Oh. I told you.
- Yeah!

109
00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:30.535
Isn't it beautiful?
This is awesome!

110
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.164
Oh! Have you ever seen
ducks like that?

111
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:45.847
Look at that.

112
00:05:45.882 --> 00:05:47.849
- They must be migrating.

113
00:05:47.884 --> 00:05:49.422
- Whoa.

114
00:05:49.457 --> 00:05:52.381
They seem so mysterious
and exotic.

115
00:05:52.416 --> 00:05:54.317
I wonder where
they flew in from.

116
00:05:54.352 --> 00:05:55.560
Maybe we should go say hi.

117
00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:56.759
Should we?

118
00:05:56.794 --> 00:05:58.288
No. Oh. look at these feathers.

119
00:05:58.323 --> 00:05:59.630
No. I want to know.

120
00:05:59.665 --> 00:06:01.566
Let's go ask 'em.
Mack. come on.

121
00:06:01.601 --> 00:06:03.931
Yeah. no. I'm good.

122
00:06:03.966 --> 00:06:05.196
Ugh. Come on.

123
00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:07.165
We never meet anyone new.

124
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.134
Okay. fine.

125
00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.171
All right. kids. let's go meet
Mom's new friends.

126
00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.008
Kids?

127
00:06:15.043 --> 00:06:17.714
Kids? Kids?

128
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:18.946
Pretty good progress. huh?

129
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:20.453
Yeah. Got to love a tailwind.

130
00:06:20.488 --> 00:06:21.619
- Yeah.
- Oh.

131
00:06:21.654 --> 00:06:23.115
- Hello.
- Ah. Hello.

132
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.281
Welcome to the pond.

133
00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:25.381
- Thank you.
- Hey there.

134
00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:26.558
- Oh. hi.
- Nice feathers.

135
00:06:26.593 --> 00:06:27.790
We shouldn't be here. Dax.

136
00:06:27.825 --> 00:06:29.495
- Shh!
- Dad is gonna be mad.

137
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.958
- Go back to the parents. Gwen.

138
00:06:30.993 --> 00:06:33.257
- Hey there.
- Dax!

139
00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:34.599
What are you doing?

140
00:06:34.634 --> 00:06:36.029
I don't want to be
psycho-killed!

141
00:06:36.064 --> 00:06:38.262
Let me go.
you little feathery wart! -Oh.

142
00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:39.967
Okay. I'm a feathery wart?

143
00:06:40.002 --> 00:06:41.738
You don't even know me.

144
00:06:41.773 --> 00:06:43.806
No. no. no. no. no. no.
She's a feathery wart.

145
00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:45.269
You're a very nice wart.

146
00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:46.743
I-I mean wart duck.

147
00:06:46.778 --> 00:06:48.272
- I mean...
- I'm kidding.

148
00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:49.812
Oh. Right.

149
00:06:51.816 --> 00:06:53.717
Hi. I'm Kim.

150
00:06:53.752 --> 00:06:55.411
Hi. I'm Dax.

151
00:06:55.446 --> 00:06:56.852
Welcome to Moosehead Pond.

152
00:06:56.887 --> 00:06:58.414
"Welcome to na-na-na."

153
00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:00.856
You and your flock can stay
here as long as you like.

154
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:02.561
- I could show you around.
- Hmm?

155
00:07:02.596 --> 00:07:05.289
I mean. this is
pretty much it. but...

156
00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:06.829
Mmm. Thanks.

157
00:07:06.864 --> 00:07:08.963
But we're just passing by
on our way down south.

158
00:07:08.998 --> 00:07:10.327
We're gonna spend
the winter there.

159
00:07:10.362 --> 00:07:11.427
Where are you guys going?

160
00:07:11.462 --> 00:07:12.769
We spend winter here

161
00:07:12.804 --> 00:07:14.199
to avoid psycho killers
like your...

162
00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:16.003
- Sorry. Wart.

163
00:07:16.038 --> 00:07:19.369
Wait. So you don't go anywhere
for the winter?

164
00:07:19.404 --> 00:07:20.777
Uh. nope.

165
00:07:20.812 --> 00:07:23.109
You should
totally come with us.

166
00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:24.880
- What? Really?

167
00:07:24.915 --> 00:07:27.080
Yes! Your flock could
totally join ours.

168
00:07:27.115 --> 00:07:28.851
Oh. my gosh.
this will be so cool.

169
00:07:28.886 --> 00:07:31.447
You will love migrating.
The sun. the sand.

170
00:07:31.482 --> 00:07:33.251
Wait. Do you like tropical food?

171
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.890
- What's your take on bananas?
- Oh. I don't...

172
00:07:34.925 --> 00:07:36.320
Ah. you're gonna love 'em!

173
00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:38.388
You hold this.
I'll go ask my dad.

174
00:07:38.423 --> 00:07:39.598
Dad! Dad!

175
00:07:39.633 --> 00:07:41.226
- What just happened?
- Dad!

176
00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:43.459
I don't know.
but you're in trouble.

177
00:07:43.494 --> 00:07:45.065
Dax! Gwen!

178
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.903
Are you crazy? You can't
just take off like that.

179
00:07:47.938 --> 00:07:50.202
- He made me do it!
- What?

180
00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:52.468
And he talked to a girl.

181
00:07:52.503 --> 00:07:54.074
- A girl?
- Gwen!

182
00:07:54.109 --> 00:07:56.549
Yeah. and he told her
he wants to marry her.

183
00:07:56.584 --> 00:07:58.650
What? I didn't say that!

184
00:07:58.685 --> 00:08:00.113
You said it with your eyes.

185
00:08:00.148 --> 00:08:02.082
Dad. he's hitting me!
He's hitting me!

186
00:08:02.117 --> 00:08:03.622
Hey. hey. hey. hey!
Enough! Enough!

187
00:08:03.657 --> 00:08:06.251
- Sibling cruelty!
- Enough.

188
00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:07.659
Okay. Hello.

189
00:08:07.694 --> 00:08:09.089
Hi. Hi. Big hellos.

190
00:08:09.124 --> 00:08:10.596
And we're good. Let's go.

191
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:11.993
- Mack.
- What? I said hi.

192
00:08:12.028 --> 00:08:13.599
I smiled. I made eye contact.

193
00:08:13.634 --> 00:08:15.161
I checked all the boxes.

194
00:08:15.196 --> 00:08:16.327
Hey there.

195
00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:18.494
I hear you want to join
our migration.

196
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:20.397
Sorry?

197
00:08:20.432 --> 00:08:22.333
Oh. we're going back to Jamaica.

198
00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:23.576
Have you ever been?

199
00:08:23.611 --> 00:08:24.973
No.

200
00:08:25.008 --> 00:08:27.041
Oh. it's just magical.

201
00:08:27.076 --> 00:08:29.505
I swear. there's even
a luminous lagoon

202
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.847
where the water glows.

203
00:08:30.882 --> 00:08:33.212
Oh. wow. Oh. I really
want to see that.

204
00:08:33.247 --> 00:08:35.016
Well. then it is settled.

205
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:37.018
Your whole flock can join us.

206
00:08:37.053 --> 00:08:38.415
This is gonna be great.

207
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.889
Oh. gosh. That's...

208
00:08:39.924 --> 00:08:41.484
That's just so nice of you.

209
00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:43.090
Wait. wait. wait.

210
00:08:43.125 --> 00:08:45.521
I think there's a slight
misunderstanding here.

211
00:08:45.556 --> 00:08:47.864
Unfortunately.
we're just slammed this winter.

212
00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:49.701
Aren't we. Pam?

213
00:08:49.736 --> 00:08:51.703
'Cause we've got the thing.
and then the...

214
00:08:51.738 --> 00:08:54.640
We got the thing after that.
So. you know what? We can't go.

215
00:08:54.675 --> 00:08:56.235
But you guys go.

216
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.610
Have a great time.

217
00:08:57.645 --> 00:09:01.009
And. you know. tell
the glowing water we said hi.

218
00:09:02.408 --> 00:09:04.815
Uh. well. maybe next year. then?

219
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.883
You got it. Next year!

220
00:09:06.918 --> 00:09:11.954
Uh. well. I guess
it's time for us to go.

221
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.927
Uh. have a nice trip.

222
00:09:18.765 --> 00:09:20.391
Thanks.

223
00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:23.097
Have a nice... pond.

224
00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:34.207
I'm so sorry you can't
have babies with her.

225
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.348
That was so... rude!

226
00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:44.547
I know.

227
00:09:44.582 --> 00:09:46.285
"Have a nice pond."

228
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.517
Who says that?

229
00:09:47.552 --> 00:09:48.925
That's just poor parenting.

230
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.894
Not them. You.

231
00:09:50.929 --> 00:09:53.424
- Me?
- Yes. you.

232
00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:56.493
Okay. So I got
a little carried away.

233
00:09:56.528 --> 00:09:58.330
But migration?

234
00:09:58.365 --> 00:09:59.738
What a stupid idea.

235
00:09:59.773 --> 00:10:02.037
- Ugh. Okay. You're impossible.
- Why?

236
00:10:02.072 --> 00:10:04.039
Because I found
a safe place for us to live

237
00:10:04.074 --> 00:10:06.008
and we're happy here?

238
00:10:06.043 --> 00:10:08.043
You mean you're happy here.

239
00:10:08.078 --> 00:10:09.308
What?

240
00:10:09.343 --> 00:10:11.849
I-I want us to get out
and see the world.

241
00:10:11.884 --> 00:10:13.279
- Me. too. Dad.
- Yeah.

242
00:10:13.314 --> 00:10:15.985
I want to go to Jamai...
Jam... J...

243
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.756
where they make jam.

244
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:20.220
You-you really want
those things?

245
00:10:20.255 --> 00:10:21.584
Yes.

246
00:10:21.619 --> 00:10:23.861
- Really?
Yes.

247
00:10:23.896 --> 00:10:25.027
No home improvements?

248
00:10:25.062 --> 00:10:26.655
- PAM and DAX: No!
Yes.

249
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.525
I mean... I mean no.

250
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.967
D-Do you know what can happen
on a trip that long?

251
00:10:31.002 --> 00:10:32.364
What sort of father would I be

252
00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:34.201
if I put my young fowl
in harm's way

253
00:10:34.236 --> 00:10:37.435
for no reason except a chance
at a Caribbean vacation?

254
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.536
A father who knows
it's important for his kids

255
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:41.340
to see other parts of the world.

256
00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:43.210
Mack. I don't want
to miss out on life

257
00:10:43.245 --> 00:10:45.509
because you're afraid
to leave this pond.

258
00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:47.951
This isn't about migration.

259
00:10:47.986 --> 00:10:50.987
It's about adventure.

260
00:10:51.022 --> 00:10:54.155
Seeing what else
life has to offer.

261
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.553
Is that a little scary? Sure.

262
00:10:56.588 --> 00:10:58.764
But isn't it worth it?

263
00:11:00.163 --> 00:11:01.657
No. Pam.

264
00:11:01.692 --> 00:11:03.494
Not really.

265
00:11:07.071 --> 00:11:10.974
You really need to open
your eyes. Mack.

266
00:11:11.009 --> 00:11:13.878
before you miss it all.

267
00:11:13.913 --> 00:11:15.847
Come on. kids.

268
00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:30.356
- Hmm?

269
00:11:31.722 --> 00:11:33.194
Huh? Huh?

270
00:11:34.901 --> 00:11:36.692
Uncle Dan.
what are you doing here?

271
00:11:38.201 --> 00:11:40.069
I don't know.

272
00:11:40.104 --> 00:11:42.940
I must have drifted
from my nest again.

273
00:11:45.208 --> 00:11:47.142
Be a good boy
and get me back there.

274
00:11:47.177 --> 00:11:48.781
Give me a little push.

275
00:11:48.816 --> 00:11:50.915
All right.

276
00:11:58.155 --> 00:12:00.221
Thank you.

277
00:12:00.256 --> 00:12:02.828
I heard the little family tiff.

278
00:12:02.863 --> 00:12:04.896
I got to say...

279
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:06.425
you're right.

280
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.031
Wha... I am?

281
00:12:08.066 --> 00:12:09.230
Please.

282
00:12:09.265 --> 00:12:10.935
What's all the travel talk?

283
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.036
I mean.
why can't we be satisfied

284
00:12:13.071 --> 00:12:14.906
with what we already have?

285
00:12:14.941 --> 00:12:16.908
Well. yeah.

286
00:12:16.943 --> 00:12:18.272
I mean. you got food right here.

287
00:12:18.307 --> 00:12:20.703
We got a pond right here.
Right?

288
00:12:20.738 --> 00:12:22.848
Yeah. Food. the pond.

289
00:12:22.883 --> 00:12:24.707
Why go anywhere else?

290
00:12:24.742 --> 00:12:26.247
Stick to your beliefs. kid.

291
00:12:26.282 --> 00:12:28.986
- Don't change for anyone.
- Exactly.

292
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:30.823
And you'll end up just like me.

293
00:12:30.858 --> 00:12:32.616
- Happy.
- Yeah.

294
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:33.826
- Healthy.
- Yeah.

295
00:12:33.861 --> 00:12:35.388
And totally alone!

296
00:12:35.423 --> 00:12:37.456
Yeah! Wait. what?

297
00:12:37.491 --> 00:12:38.897
That's right.

298
00:12:38.932 --> 00:12:41.867
You'll be living the dream.

299
00:12:43.266 --> 00:12:45.101
Whoa. that was exhausting.

300
00:12:45.136 --> 00:12:47.367
I'm gonna just rest here.

301
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:53.802
Rise and shine. Mallards!

302
00:12:53.837 --> 00:12:55.210
We're burning daylight.

303
00:12:55.245 --> 00:12:56.772
Up and at 'em.

304
00:12:56.807 --> 00:12:58.147
Let's go. go. go!

305
00:12:58.182 --> 00:13:00.149
Here's breakfast.

306
00:13:00.184 --> 00:13:02.118
Dad. what are you doing?

307
00:13:02.153 --> 00:13:03.856
Getting your sorry feathers
out of bed.

308
00:13:03.891 --> 00:13:05.748
Come on. We got to get ready.

309
00:13:05.783 --> 00:13:08.058
Mack. ready for what?

310
00:13:08.093 --> 00:13:10.060
Nothing. Just. you know.

311
00:13:10.095 --> 00:13:13.965
for our big.
super fun family migration!

312
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.296
What?

313
00:13:15.331 --> 00:13:17.496
Ha! Bet you didn't
see that coming.

314
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:19.366
- Are-are you serious?
- Yep.

315
00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:22.831
An adventure into
the totally unknown.

316
00:13:22.866 --> 00:13:24.536
And I'm gonna love it.

317
00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:27.011
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. I-Is this real?

318
00:13:27.046 --> 00:13:28.309
What do you mean.
"Is this real?"

319
00:13:28.344 --> 00:13:29.607
We're really going?

320
00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:30.740
- Yes.
- On a migration?

321
00:13:30.775 --> 00:13:32.148
- Mm-hmm.
- To Jamaica?

322
00:13:32.183 --> 00:13:33.578
- Yeah.
- Together?

323
00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:34.678
- Yes.
- Like. everyone?

324
00:13:34.713 --> 00:13:37.120
- Yes.
- Including you?

325
00:13:37.155 --> 00:13:39.122
Yes! We are all going
on a migration to Jamaica.

326
00:13:39.157 --> 00:13:40.783
In which language
should I tell you?

327
00:13:40.818 --> 00:13:43.060
Thanks. Dad.

328
00:13:43.854 --> 00:13:45.161
You're welcome.

329
00:13:45.196 --> 00:13:46.558
Oh!

330
00:13:46.593 --> 00:13:49.693
I knew there was
some adventure left in you.

331
00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:52.168
Wait. wait. wait!

332
00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.539
Uncle Dan. you're coming. too!

333
00:14:00.574 --> 00:14:02.145
- Gwen. no. no.
- No. no. no. no. no. no.

334
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.707
We're going to Jamaica.

335
00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:06.083
No. I don't think so. kiddo.

336
00:14:06.118 --> 00:14:08.019
Oh. please. Uncle Dan.

337
00:14:08.054 --> 00:14:09.548
Nah.

338
00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:10.846
Oh. too bad he doesn't want
to come. honey.

339
00:14:10.881 --> 00:14:12.122
We tried. What else can we do?

340
00:14:12.157 --> 00:14:13.552
- Let's leave.

341
00:14:15.358 --> 00:14:17.886
Please...

342
00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:30.041
Pretty please?

343
00:14:30.076 --> 00:14:31.603
Whoa. That did it.

344
00:14:31.638 --> 00:14:32.978
I can't refuse her.

345
00:14:33.013 --> 00:14:34.947
Look at her.
Look at how cute she is.

346
00:14:34.982 --> 00:14:36.806
Yes! Uncle Dan is coming!

347
00:14:36.841 --> 00:14:38.115
No. he's not.

348
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.578
Uncle Dan. Uncle Dan.

349
00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:41.118
GWEN and UNCLE DAN:
Uncle Dan. Uncle Dan...

350
00:14:41.153 --> 00:14:42.086
- Oh. for real?

351
00:14:42.121 --> 00:14:43.648
Uncle Dan. Uncle Dan.

352
00:14:43.683 --> 00:14:44.748
- Uncle Dan. that's me.
- Uncle Dan. Uncle Dan.

353
00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:46.420
Yeah!

354
00:14:46.455 --> 00:14:48.092
MACK and PAM
Yay.

355
00:14:54.265 --> 00:14:57.596
Here we go.
Let's do the final check.

356
00:14:57.631 --> 00:14:59.598
Tail feather torsion?

357
00:14:59.633 --> 00:15:00.632
Check.

358
00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:02.535
Wing deployment?

359
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:03.734
Check.

360
00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:06.440
Heads in takeoff mode?

361
00:15:06.475 --> 00:15:07.639
Check.

362
00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:10.576
Let's fly.

363
00:15:29.201 --> 00:15:31.069
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

364
00:15:31.104 --> 00:15:33.929
Woo-hoo!

365
00:15:33.964 --> 00:15:36.470
Whoa! Whoo!

366
00:15:37.869 --> 00:15:40.111
Yeah!

367
00:15:44.249 --> 00:15:47.712
Okay. everyone.
enough fooling around.

368
00:15:47.747 --> 00:15:49.780
"V" formation.

369
00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:51.353
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

370
00:15:51.388 --> 00:15:53.190
- Look at me!
- Thanks. Dad!

371
00:15:53.225 --> 00:15:55.555
- Whoo!
- Yeah. this is awesome!

372
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.360
Well. better get used to it.

373
00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:09.503
Huh. That's weird.

374
00:16:09.538 --> 00:16:11.373
My inner compass may be
a little rusty.

375
00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:13.771
but I'm sure
we're heading south.

376
00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:15.938
Yeah. we are. but why are we

377
00:16:15.973 --> 00:16:18.215
the only birds heading this way?

378
00:16:26.258 --> 00:16:28.016
Hey. kids. don't worry.

379
00:16:28.051 --> 00:16:29.457
We're gonna be all right.

380
00:16:29.492 --> 00:16:31.096
Here we are together.

381
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:32.592
We're on an adventure.

382
00:16:32.627 --> 00:16:35.199
I promised adventure.
and this is exactly

383
00:16:35.234 --> 00:16:37.201
what I promised. huh?

384
00:16:39.139 --> 00:16:40.633
We're not gonna make it. are we?

385
00:16:40.668 --> 00:16:42.734
- Uncle Dan!
- You can tell me. I don't mind.

386
00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:45.110
I'm a big boy. I'm a big duck.

387
00:16:45.145 --> 00:16:47.244
No. Uncle Dan.
things are gonna be fine.

388
00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:48.905
- Isn't that right. Mack?

389
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.577
Uh. I. uh...

390
00:16:50.612 --> 00:16:54.042
I mean yes. Mom's right.

391
00:16:54.077 --> 00:16:55.846
This is fun.

392
00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:58.981
This is the kind of thing we'll
remember for years to come.

393
00:16:59.016 --> 00:17:01.016
We'll look back and laugh.

394
00:17:20.708 --> 00:17:22.906
- A heron.
- The one from Dad's story.

395
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:24.644
The ultimate duck killer.

396
00:17:24.679 --> 00:17:26.250
Don't panic.

397
00:17:26.285 --> 00:17:29.286
Herons can't see
their prey if you stay still.

398
00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:33.752
Hello. little ducks.

399
00:17:33.787 --> 00:17:35.853
She's bluffing.

400
00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:40.495
So. tell me. what's a nice
little family of mallards

401
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:44.136
doing down here
all cold and wet?

402
00:17:44.171 --> 00:17:46.435
Nothing. We're good.

403
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.096
We're enjoying it.

404
00:17:48.131 --> 00:17:50.340
But you must be freezing here.

405
00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:51.605
- Oh. no. we're not.
- Come.

406
00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.277
- Oh. no. no. no. no. no.
- Come. come.

407
00:17:53.312 --> 00:17:57.215
Let Erin take care of you
in her comfy little nest.

408
00:18:01.518 --> 00:18:03.221
In you go. Hup. hup. hup.

409
00:18:03.256 --> 00:18:05.080
Harry!

410
00:18:05.115 --> 00:18:06.752
Harry. look.

411
00:18:06.787 --> 00:18:08.017
Look what I found.

412
00:18:08.052 --> 00:18:12.857
A nice little family
of traveling mallards.

413
00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:15.497
Mallards.

414
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.207
Uh. okay. Nice meeting you all.

415
00:18:22.242 --> 00:18:23.373
Bye-bye.

416
00:18:23.408 --> 00:18:26.277
In a rush. are you?

417
00:18:26.312 --> 00:18:28.070
Oh. we don't want
to be a bother.

418
00:18:28.105 --> 00:18:31.249
You look busy decaying.

419
00:18:31.284 --> 00:18:33.878
You're not bothering at all.

420
00:18:33.913 --> 00:18:37.321
But maybe herons are not

421
00:18:37.356 --> 00:18:41.325
good enough for you. mallards?

422
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.821
No. of course not.

423
00:18:42.856 --> 00:18:45.857
We're happy to stay.

424
00:18:48.367 --> 00:18:50.532
Good!
Let me get your bed ready.

425
00:18:50.567 --> 00:18:53.029
What do they do.
rip you apart. then eat you?

426
00:18:53.064 --> 00:18:54.701
- Dan.

427
00:18:54.736 --> 00:18:56.208
I don't know how they do it.
What's the method?

428
00:18:56.243 --> 00:18:58.001
- Hey. Zip it.

429
00:18:58.036 --> 00:19:00.311
Wake me up when it's
my turn to be eaten.

430
00:19:00.346 --> 00:19:02.137
- What?
- What are you doing. Pam?

431
00:19:02.172 --> 00:19:04.282
Well. I don't know. I just...
I don't want to offend them.

432
00:19:04.317 --> 00:19:05.613
Can't you see
they want to eat us?

433
00:19:05.648 --> 00:19:07.109
I don't want to be eaten!

434
00:19:07.144 --> 00:19:08.286
Well. she can't eat us.

435
00:19:08.321 --> 00:19:09.683
She doesn't have teeth.

436
00:19:09.718 --> 00:19:11.454
Well. what if she cuts us
into pieces first?

437
00:19:11.489 --> 00:19:13.181
I don't want to be cut
into piece...

438
00:19:13.216 --> 00:19:14.688
I-I-I beg your pardon?

439
00:19:14.723 --> 00:19:16.459
Oh. what's that? No. no.

440
00:19:16.494 --> 00:19:19.495
We were just saying
your nest is just so charming.

441
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.266
Weren't we. kids?

442
00:19:21.301 --> 00:19:23.301
Oh. thank you.

443
00:19:23.336 --> 00:19:25.567
We moved here a few years ago.

444
00:19:25.602 --> 00:19:28.471
We used to migrate
all the time like you.

445
00:19:28.506 --> 00:19:31.441
Harry was such an adventurer.

446
00:19:31.476 --> 00:19:33.102
Fierce predator. too.

447
00:19:33.137 --> 00:19:37.315
He could catch any prey
with a single swift peck.

448
00:19:45.754 --> 00:19:49.459
Those were the good old days.

449
00:19:49.494 --> 00:19:51.956
Now Harry's too old.

450
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:57.467
I'm the one who brings food
back to the nest.

451
00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:03.165
But. anyway.
you must be exhausted.

452
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.639
Here's your bed.

453
00:20:05.807 --> 00:20:07.642
There's no way
we're sleeping in that.

454
00:20:07.677 --> 00:20:10.414
But it's our finest bed.

455
00:20:10.449 --> 00:20:11.943
And it is perfect.

456
00:20:11.978 --> 00:20:13.813
Thank you.

457
00:20:13.848 --> 00:20:15.518
Wow. huh?

458
00:20:15.553 --> 00:20:18.785
Hey. feel this.
Even comfier than our own nest.

459
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.490
Yeah. sure.

460
00:20:20.525 --> 00:20:22.789
It's greasier. too. Oh!

461
00:20:23.924 --> 00:20:27.255
Looks like your last guest
is still here.

462
00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.224
- And dead.

463
00:20:29.259 --> 00:20:31.160
Thank you.

464
00:20:31.195 --> 00:20:33.404
You're welcome. sweethearts.

465
00:20:33.439 --> 00:20:34.735
Sleep tight.

466
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.310
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

467
00:20:51.215 --> 00:20:52.720
Okay. Storm is over.

468
00:20:52.755 --> 00:20:54.722
Let's go. Kids. kids. wake up.

469
00:20:54.757 --> 00:20:56.460
- Pam. we got to go right now.
- What?

470
00:20:56.495 --> 00:20:57.824
- Right now!
- Now?

471
00:20:57.859 --> 00:20:59.694
- What about Uncle Dan?
- It's fine.

472
00:20:59.729 --> 00:21:01.190
When they wake up.
they'll eat him.

473
00:21:01.225 --> 00:21:03.027
That'll give us more time
to lose...

474
00:21:04.602 --> 00:21:06.096
You're awake.

475
00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:08.197
Looking right at us. too.

476
00:21:08.232 --> 00:21:10.100
- Bonus.
- Shh!

477
00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:14.676
You shouldn't have gotten
out of your beds.

478
00:21:14.711 --> 00:21:19.175
Nighttime is when
predators like to feed.

479
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.781
Stay away from my kids.

480
00:21:20.816 --> 00:21:23.355
Let's do this quick!

481
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.115
Run. kids. run!

482
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.391
Let me get them!

483
00:21:28.021 --> 00:21:30.956
Harry. catch them!

484
00:21:32.498 --> 00:21:34.861
- Head for the door!

485
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.934
Go. go!

486
00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.136
Hands off!

487
00:21:47.513 --> 00:21:49.271
- It's okay. kids.

488
00:21:49.306 --> 00:21:51.075
Just hold still.

489
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.384
No. no. no. no. no.

490
00:21:53.717 --> 00:21:54.881
Please don't eat us.

491
00:21:54.916 --> 00:21:56.421
We haven't finished molting yet.

492
00:21:56.456 --> 00:21:57.785
Pretty please?

493
00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.557
I promise you this won't hurt.

494
00:22:07.027 --> 00:22:08.532
- No!

495
00:22:10.063 --> 00:22:11.502
Gotcha!

496
00:22:11.537 --> 00:22:15.132
He was about to gulp you
in one bite.

497
00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:16.331
Bad fish.

498
00:22:16.366 --> 00:22:19.136
Ooh. bad fish!

499
00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:23.008
You... you saved them?

500
00:22:23.043 --> 00:22:24.515
Oh.

501
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.011
It was nothing.

502
00:22:26.046 --> 00:22:28.948
And we have breakfast
for tomorrow.

503
00:22:28.983 --> 00:22:30.950
Right. Harry?

504
00:22:32.349 --> 00:22:35.383
Into beddy-byes now.

505
00:22:54.646 --> 00:22:56.613
Are you sure
you have to go already?

506
00:22:56.648 --> 00:22:59.616
I'll miss your kids so much.

507
00:22:59.651 --> 00:23:01.552
They are so adorable.

508
00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.986
Mmm. And you taste so good.

509
00:23:07.021 --> 00:23:10.286
- Maybe I'll eat you.
Uh...

510
00:23:10.321 --> 00:23:11.760
I'm kidding.

511
00:23:14.457 --> 00:23:16.930
- Or am I?
- Huh?

512
00:23:17.834 --> 00:23:19.636
- It's a joke!
- Oh.

513
00:23:19.671 --> 00:23:22.034
- It's a joke.

514
00:23:22.069 --> 00:23:23.299
So funny.

515
00:23:23.334 --> 00:23:24.971
All right.

516
00:23:25.006 --> 00:23:27.369
Time to go.
Thanks for everything.

517
00:23:27.404 --> 00:23:29.514
Oh. goodbye.

518
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:31.043
Uh. I haven't kissed
Harry goodbye!

519
00:23:31.078 --> 00:23:33.078
No. no. no. no. no. no. no. no.
Blow him a kiss.

520
00:23:33.113 --> 00:23:34.915
- MACK and GWEN: Mwah. Mwah.

521
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:36.785
No. no. no. no.
you don't have to walk closer.

522
00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.314
You're good there. Bye. Harry.

523
00:23:38.349 --> 00:23:39.788
Thanks so much. Mwah.

524
00:23:39.823 --> 00:23:43.792
Don't forget.
drop by on your way back.

525
00:23:44.597 --> 00:23:46.355
Whew.

526
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:47.664
Wild night there. huh?

527
00:23:47.699 --> 00:23:50.392
Yeah.

528
00:23:50.427 --> 00:23:51.866
Yeah.

529
00:23:51.901 --> 00:23:53.362
How about when she pulled out
that pan. though?

530
00:23:53.397 --> 00:23:56.431
Oh. my gosh! With the dead fish
still in the pan?

531
00:23:56.466 --> 00:23:57.938
- The dead fish.
- Terrifying.

532
00:23:57.973 --> 00:24:00.204
Right? Still. lovely birds.

533
00:24:00.239 --> 00:24:02.206
Oh. lovely.

534
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:03.944
Lovely birds.

535
00:24:05.343 --> 00:24:07.277
Guys! Come up!

536
00:24:07.312 --> 00:24:10.247
You have to see this.

537
00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:12.084
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
Hey. hey. hey.

538
00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:14.889
Dax. let's keep the adventure
where I can see you.

539
00:24:26.496 --> 00:24:28.463
Whoa!

540
00:24:31.237 --> 00:24:32.709
Woo-hoo! Come on!

541
00:24:32.744 --> 00:24:33.974
Try it. Dad!

542
00:24:34.009 --> 00:24:35.910
Okay. okay.
this is pretty cool.

543
00:24:35.945 --> 00:24:37.648
but we should probably
get back on...

544
00:24:39.047 --> 00:24:41.685
Don't be such
a stick-in-the-mud.

545
00:24:48.595 --> 00:24:52.091
Woo-hoo!

546
00:24:52.126 --> 00:24:53.455
Whoa!

547
00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.571
Ah. yeah!

548
00:24:59.606 --> 00:25:01.529
- Woo-hoo!

549
00:25:01.564 --> 00:25:03.201
- Hello!

550
00:25:05.403 --> 00:25:07.436
- Peekaboo!
- Whoa! Dad!

551
00:25:16.788 --> 00:25:19.019
Ow. Hey. watch out.

552
00:25:19.054 --> 00:25:20.724
Hey!

553
00:25:21.551 --> 00:25:24.486
- Aha! Whoo!

554
00:25:24.521 --> 00:25:26.763
Gotcha! Whoo!

555
00:25:26.798 --> 00:25:29.029
That was fun.

556
00:25:29.064 --> 00:25:30.899
Let's go down
before we lose our way.

557
00:25:30.934 --> 00:25:32.527
Please. Dad. come on.

558
00:25:32.562 --> 00:25:34.067
- Just a bit more.
- Please. Dad?

559
00:25:34.102 --> 00:25:37.367
Okay. okay.
just a little bit longer.

560
00:25:37.402 --> 00:25:39.369
What is that?

561
00:27:03.763 --> 00:27:06.731
- Whoa!

562
00:27:10.836 --> 00:27:13.298
Guys. you okay?

563
00:27:13.333 --> 00:27:15.102
Yeah! What a ride.

564
00:27:15.137 --> 00:27:16.807
Let's do it again.

565
00:27:16.842 --> 00:27:18.237
Yeah!

566
00:27:18.272 --> 00:27:19.975
Your mother.

567
00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:21.570
- Where's your mother?

568
00:27:21.605 --> 00:27:23.209
Pam?

569
00:27:25.444 --> 00:27:26.784
That is not your mother.

570
00:27:26.819 --> 00:27:28.786
Up here! Fly up.

571
00:27:28.821 --> 00:27:30.887
We can see so much better
from up here.

572
00:27:30.922 --> 00:27:32.416
- Pam! Are you hurt somewhere?
- Oh! What?

573
00:27:32.451 --> 00:27:34.253
- Do you feel pain?
- I-I'm fine.

574
00:27:34.288 --> 00:27:35.958
What's your name? How many
feathers am I holding up?

575
00:27:35.993 --> 00:27:37.927
Hey. I'm fine.

576
00:27:40.723 --> 00:27:42.096
Thank goodness.

577
00:27:42.131 --> 00:27:43.625
Okay. Come on. everyone.

578
00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.969
Prepare for takeoff
so we can get out of...

579
00:27:48.731 --> 00:27:50.269
...here.

580
00:27:51.107 --> 00:27:52.810
What is this place?

581
00:27:52.845 --> 00:27:54.405
I... I don't know.

582
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.209
We've never been
this far before.

583
00:27:56.244 --> 00:27:59.509
Uncle Dan. have you ever
been here before?

584
00:27:59.544 --> 00:28:01.115
Uncle Dan?

585
00:28:01.953 --> 00:28:04.415
Hello? Guys?

586
00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.120
Anyone?

587
00:28:06.155 --> 00:28:08.386
I don't like heights.

588
00:28:15.802 --> 00:28:17.362
Oh. whoa!

589
00:28:17.397 --> 00:28:19.430
Whoa. whoa! Whoa!

590
00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:22.730
Uncle Dan?

591
00:28:22.765 --> 00:28:23.973
Yeah. it's me!

592
00:28:24.008 --> 00:28:25.403
- It's Uncle Dan!

593
00:28:25.438 --> 00:28:28.571
Uncle Dan!

594
00:28:29.739 --> 00:28:31.739
Well. he led a good life.

595
00:28:31.774 --> 00:28:33.312
What?

596
00:28:33.347 --> 00:28:35.281
We're coming for you. Uncle Dan!

597
00:28:35.316 --> 00:28:37.283
He would have wanted us
to go on without him.

598
00:28:37.318 --> 00:28:40.715
Come on. he was kind like that.

599
00:28:56.766 --> 00:28:58.172
Ow!

600
00:28:59.241 --> 00:29:01.945
Oh. Well. hello there.

601
00:29:03.982 --> 00:29:06.884
- Ah...

602
00:29:14.454 --> 00:29:15.651
Get away. get away!

603
00:29:17.754 --> 00:29:19.787
Pigeons.

604
00:29:19.822 --> 00:29:21.624
Mmm.

605
00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:23.032
Ah...

606
00:29:24.827 --> 00:29:28.499
Uncle Dan!
Uncle Dan!

607
00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:31.139
- Uncle Dan!
- Uncle Dan!

608
00:29:31.174 --> 00:29:32.800
- Uncle Dan. where are you?
- Uncle Dan!

609
00:29:32.835 --> 00:29:34.043
Uncle Dan?

610
00:29:34.078 --> 00:29:35.506
What if something ate Uncle Dan?

611
00:29:35.541 --> 00:29:37.475
Honey. I promise you.
nothing would ever

612
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:38.883
want to eat Uncle Dan.

613
00:29:38.918 --> 00:29:41.050
- Uncle Dan.

614
00:29:41.085 --> 00:29:43.349
Get off me!

615
00:29:43.384 --> 00:29:45.747
I'm coming!

616
00:29:45.782 --> 00:29:48.321
- Hey. wait! Wait!

617
00:29:48.356 --> 00:29:50.059
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

618
00:29:50.094 --> 00:29:51.995
It's my sandwich.

619
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.458
I licked it. I licked it!

620
00:29:53.493 --> 00:29:55.031
You can't touch it
with duck spit on it.

621
00:29:55.066 --> 00:29:56.197
Uncle Dan!

622
00:29:56.232 --> 00:29:58.331
Get your wings off my uncle!

623
00:29:59.598 --> 00:30:01.070
Dax. Gwen. wait!

624
00:30:01.105 --> 00:30:02.368
Stay away from my family!

625
00:30:02.403 --> 00:30:04.238
Back away!
Back away! Back away!

626
00:30:04.273 --> 00:30:07.439
Get out of here.
you trashy. trashy vermin!

627
00:30:10.774 --> 00:30:13.346
PIGEON
Who said that?

628
00:30:15.548 --> 00:30:20.650
I asked. "Who said that?"

629
00:30:23.853 --> 00:30:25.864
Huh?

630
00:30:36.767 --> 00:30:38.536
Come here. bumpkin.

631
00:30:38.571 --> 00:30:40.835
Uh... Oh.

632
00:30:45.776 --> 00:30:47.677
Say it again.

633
00:30:47.712 --> 00:30:49.613
Uh. which part?

634
00:30:49.648 --> 00:30:53.419
"Trashy. trashy vermin."

635
00:30:53.454 --> 00:30:56.521
Let the record reflect I just
meant to say "trashy vermin."

636
00:30:57.788 --> 00:30:59.557
Which I'm not saying
that's good.

637
00:30:59.592 --> 00:31:02.934
but I wasn't doubling down
on "trashy." vermin.

638
00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:07.400
You ducks make me sick.
you know that?

639
00:31:08.436 --> 00:31:11.371
You're fed all day
by the humans in the park.

640
00:31:11.406 --> 00:31:13.175
but that's not enough for you.

641
00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:14.506
No. no. no.

642
00:31:14.541 --> 00:31:17.080
You got to come
to our territory.

643
00:31:17.115 --> 00:31:19.115
You got to steal our food.

644
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.447
And then you insult us?

645
00:31:21.482 --> 00:31:22.987
What? No. no. no. no.
I wasn't...

646
00:31:23.022 --> 00:31:24.615
- Name!
- Uh. Mack.

647
00:31:26.223 --> 00:31:29.994
Well. "Uh. Mack." I'm the Chump.

648
00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:33.657
and I'm the leader of
this group of hardworking birds

649
00:31:33.692 --> 00:31:35.395
you just called vermin.

650
00:31:38.202 --> 00:31:39.795
Okay. okay. okay. okay.

651
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.269
So listen. Chump...

652
00:31:41.304 --> 00:31:42.600
- What did you just call me?

653
00:31:42.635 --> 00:31:44.569
Sorry.
I thought your name was Chump.

654
00:31:44.604 --> 00:31:46.109
Yeah. Chump. yeah.
That's my name. Why?

655
00:31:46.144 --> 00:31:47.572
Right. So listen. Chump...

656
00:31:47.607 --> 00:31:49.343
- What did you just call me?!
- I'm sorry.

657
00:31:49.378 --> 00:31:51.873
Is everyone else
hearing "Chump" or...

658
00:31:51.908 --> 00:31:53.380
- What did... What?
- Okay. okay.

659
00:31:53.415 --> 00:31:56.020
I think there's a slight
misunderstanding here.

660
00:31:56.055 --> 00:31:57.384
Excuse me. Will you excuse me?

661
00:31:57.419 --> 00:31:58.880
Coming through.
Uh-huh. Thank you.

662
00:31:58.915 --> 00:32:00.948
Okay. Hi there. I'm Pam.

663
00:32:00.983 --> 00:32:03.291
I'm sharing my life with him.
so I'm painfully aware

664
00:32:03.326 --> 00:32:05.689
of all the stupid things
that come out of his mouth.

665
00:32:05.724 --> 00:32:06.888
Hmm?

666
00:32:06.923 --> 00:32:08.296
Oh. yeah. that's true. She is.

667
00:32:08.331 --> 00:32:11.134
But I assure you.
he meant no harm.

668
00:32:11.169 --> 00:32:12.531
And to show our gratitude

669
00:32:12.566 --> 00:32:14.104
for your understanding
in this matter.

670
00:32:14.139 --> 00:32:18.207
how about we share
the sandwich 50-50?

671
00:32:22.345 --> 00:32:25.115
- 80-20.
- 60-40.

672
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:26.974
- 70-30.
- 65-35.

673
00:32:27.009 --> 00:32:29.614
- 68-32!
- 67-33!

674
00:32:30.881 --> 00:32:32.254
You got yourself a deal.

675
00:32:32.289 --> 00:32:34.388
Uncle Dan. cut the sandwich.

676
00:32:34.423 --> 00:32:36.060
Uh...

677
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.591
You don't want to try
50-50 again?

678
00:32:39.626 --> 00:32:42.165
- Uncle Dan!
- All right. all right.

679
00:32:46.567 --> 00:32:47.995
You. I like.

680
00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:49.568
Thank you. Chump.

681
00:32:49.603 --> 00:32:51.801
Sorry for busting your bills
over here. but. uh...

682
00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:55.178
sometimes
I get sensitive. is all.

683
00:32:55.213 --> 00:32:57.048
Us pigeons.
we got big hearts. too.

684
00:32:57.083 --> 00:32:58.412
Ain't that right. guys?

685
00:32:58.447 --> 00:33:00.414
- Oh. for sure.

686
00:33:00.449 --> 00:33:03.153
- We just want to be loved.
- And respected.

687
00:33:04.915 --> 00:33:06.222
Yeah.

688
00:33:06.257 --> 00:33:09.357
So anything you need--
I mean anything--

689
00:33:09.392 --> 00:33:10.820
Chump's got ya.

690
00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:13.526
Oh. really?
Because we are completely lost.

691
00:33:13.561 --> 00:33:15.231
We're trying to get to Jamaica.

692
00:33:15.266 --> 00:33:16.958
Oh. yeah. yeah.
That's in Queens. right?

693
00:33:16.993 --> 00:33:18.300
Uh. more south.

694
00:33:18.335 --> 00:33:19.829
Uh. like. the Caribbean.

695
00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:22.029
Oh. that Jamaica.

696
00:33:22.064 --> 00:33:23.536
I got a buddy
who knows that place

697
00:33:23.571 --> 00:33:25.142
like the back of his wing.

698
00:33:25.177 --> 00:33:27.606
You-you think he'll help us?

699
00:33:27.641 --> 00:33:30.444
Yeah. I mean. it's a bit
of a sore subject for him.

700
00:33:30.479 --> 00:33:32.743
but. uh. I'm sure
it won't be a problem.

701
00:33:32.778 --> 00:33:35.086
Come on. lovebirds.
we ain't got all day.

702
00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:36.417
It's this way.

703
00:33:36.452 --> 00:33:39.552
Wow. Mom. you rock.

704
00:33:39.587 --> 00:33:40.520
Yeah.

705
00:33:40.555 --> 00:33:42.984
- 60-40!
-  70-30!

706
00:33:43.019 --> 00:33:44.557
60.000-3.500!

707
00:33:44.592 --> 00:33:46.889
I didn't know
you could be so tough.

708
00:33:46.924 --> 00:33:49.562
Really. Mack?!
You didn't know that?

709
00:33:49.597 --> 00:33:51.025
Oh. no. I...

710
00:33:52.567 --> 00:33:53.467
Oh!

711
00:33:53.502 --> 00:33:55.029
I get it.

712
00:33:55.064 --> 00:33:56.833
That's good.

713
00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:58.307
That's very good.

714
00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:02.476
Okay. my little bumpkins.

715
00:34:02.511 --> 00:34:04.280
- let's get a move on.
Whoa.

716
00:34:04.315 --> 00:34:06.183
Are you kidding?
We are not flying through

717
00:34:06.218 --> 00:34:08.416
this crazy death trap
of a city again.

718
00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:10.418
Oh. come on. It's nothing.

719
00:34:10.453 --> 00:34:12.123
Just stick close to me.

720
00:34:12.158 --> 00:34:14.653
and everything
will be all right.

721
00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:23.398
I'm okay. Yeah. no. I'm okay!

722
00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:26.698
- Yeah.

723
00:34:28.097 --> 00:34:29.932
I'm okay.

724
00:34:29.967 --> 00:34:31.274
I'm still okay.

725
00:34:31.309 --> 00:34:32.770
- We can do this.

726
00:34:32.805 --> 00:34:34.035
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

727
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.279
Ha-ha! You missed. bus!

728
00:34:41.044 --> 00:34:43.253
Maybe don't stick too close.

729
00:34:54.299 --> 00:34:57.267
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

730
00:35:04.672 --> 00:35:06.309
Aw.

731
00:35:06.344 --> 00:35:08.069
Here you go. my little princess.

732
00:35:08.104 --> 00:35:09.972
Thank you!

733
00:35:10.007 --> 00:35:11.314
- Woo-hoo!

734
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:13.613
Whoa. Gwen! I got you. Gwen.

735
00:35:13.648 --> 00:35:15.648
I got you.

736
00:35:15.683 --> 00:35:18.255
Look! Look. there it is.

737
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.587
That's Jamaica.

738
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.296
What?

739
00:35:42.743 --> 00:35:44.347
Here we are.

740
00:35:44.382 --> 00:35:46.811
Okay. so...

741
00:35:46.846 --> 00:35:49.286
Wait. where's our guy?

742
00:35:50.113 --> 00:35:52.080
And what is that?

743
00:35:52.115 --> 00:35:54.049
Huh? Oh. that?

744
00:35:54.084 --> 00:35:56.051
Don't worry about it.

745
00:35:56.086 --> 00:35:58.053
But I should probably warn you.

746
00:35:58.088 --> 00:36:00.891
Delroy's owner is a chef.

747
00:36:00.926 --> 00:36:02.299
A-A chef?

748
00:36:02.334 --> 00:36:03.795
Yeah. A-A chef.

749
00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.402
Like a predator
except instead of eating you.

750
00:36:06.437 --> 00:36:08.998
he feeds you to a group
of much lazier predators.

751
00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:10.934
Right this way.

752
00:36:18.713 --> 00:36:20.482
After you.

753
00:36:31.924 --> 00:36:33.264
Hey. Shh!

754
00:36:38.898 --> 00:36:40.128
Coast is clear.

755
00:36:41.373 --> 00:36:43.439
Hey. Delroy.

756
00:36:43.474 --> 00:36:45.408
How's it going?
It's been a while.

757
00:36:45.443 --> 00:36:47.377
You look good.
Slip me some feather.

758
00:36:47.412 --> 00:36:49.313
I brought you
a nice family of mallards.

759
00:36:49.348 --> 00:36:51.315
They need to ask you something.

760
00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:59.015
Oh. Well. Mr. Delroy.

761
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.721
so nice to meet you.

762
00:37:01.756 --> 00:37:04.394
Do you know the way to Jamaica?

763
00:37:06.222 --> 00:37:09.124
Do I know the way to Jamaica?

764
00:37:09.159 --> 00:37:10.466
Told ya.

765
00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:11.731
He's a little sensitive
about it.

766
00:37:11.766 --> 00:37:14.030
He was born and raised there.

767
00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:15.570
What happened?

768
00:37:15.605 --> 00:37:18.265
The chef snatched him up
in the middle of the night.

769
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:22.203
Next day. old Del's gone
from free bird to jailbird.

770
00:37:22.238 --> 00:37:23.512
Come on. D.

771
00:37:23.547 --> 00:37:25.613
Just tell them how to get there.

772
00:37:27.947 --> 00:37:30.750
Fly to the big green statue.
fly due south for three miles.

773
00:37:30.785 --> 00:37:33.555
then due east for one mile.
due west for ten miles.

774
00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:34.886
then you southwest for one mile.

775
00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:36.525
south-southeast
for two miles... -Uh...

776
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.055
...and south-southwest
for the rest of the way.

777
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.091
And don't stop
until you see that mist

778
00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:46.469
dancing atop
the beautiful blue mountains.

779
00:37:46.504 --> 00:37:49.571
You can't miss it.

780
00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:55.203
Oh. no. no. no. no. no.
No. don't cry. Big Red.

781
00:37:55.238 --> 00:37:57.513
It's all right.
We didn't mean to upset you.

782
00:37:57.548 --> 00:38:00.516
Jamaica!

783
00:38:02.487 --> 00:38:04.311
I miss my family.

784
00:38:04.346 --> 00:38:05.521
Devon.

785
00:38:05.556 --> 00:38:07.149
And likkle Donnie.

786
00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:09.690
Dolores. Deedee.

787
00:38:09.725 --> 00:38:12.891
Winston!

788
00:38:12.926 --> 00:38:14.431
That me cousin.

789
00:38:14.466 --> 00:38:18.534
Dad. we're not really gonna
leave him here. are we?

790
00:38:18.569 --> 00:38:21.537
He looks so cramped
in that cage.

791
00:38:21.572 --> 00:38:23.231
- Come on. blow it out.

792
00:38:23.266 --> 00:38:25.376
- Blow.

793
00:38:27.204 --> 00:38:29.138
There's nothing
we can do here. Dax.

794
00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:30.744
We could get the key.

795
00:38:30.779 --> 00:38:33.307
No. kid. That's impossible.

796
00:38:33.342 --> 00:38:35.144
Why? Where is it?

797
00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:37.212
Down there.

798
00:38:37.247 --> 00:38:39.720
The chef keeps that key
on him at all times.

799
00:38:39.755 --> 00:38:42.283
And trust me.
you don't want to go

800
00:38:42.318 --> 00:38:44.494
anywhere near that lunatic.

801
00:38:44.529 --> 00:38:49.323
Him catch ya. him turn you
into duck à l'orange.

802
00:38:49.358 --> 00:38:50.995
What's duck à l'orange?

803
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:54.361
It's you with l'orange on top.

804
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.035
You know what?
Guys. don't worry.

805
00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.411
- I'll go get it.
- Uh. what? No. no. no. no. no.

806
00:39:00.446 --> 00:39:01.808
Dad. it's okay. I've got this.

807
00:39:01.843 --> 00:39:03.579
No. you don't got this.

808
00:39:03.614 --> 00:39:06.208
But just because you're scared
of everything in the world

809
00:39:06.243 --> 00:39:08.111
doesn't mean I have to be.

810
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:12.819
Okay. You know what?

811
00:39:12.854 --> 00:39:14.425
I will go get the key.

812
00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.888
Cool. I'm coming with you.

813
00:39:15.923 --> 00:39:17.758
- No. You stay.
- Dad!

814
00:39:17.793 --> 00:39:20.728
Ah-ah-ah. Stay here.

815
00:40:09.141 --> 00:40:10.514
Hmm?

816
00:40:14.146 --> 00:40:15.211
Huh?

817
00:41:03.602 --> 00:41:05.492
- How's it going?

818
00:41:05.527 --> 00:41:07.362
Shh! What are you doing here?

819
00:41:07.397 --> 00:41:09.133
I told you to stay back there.

820
00:41:09.168 --> 00:41:11.267
Oh. there's no way I'm
letting you have all the fun.

821
00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:12.543
Let's go.

822
00:41:18.716 --> 00:41:20.551
There.

823
00:41:20.586 --> 00:41:21.882

824
00:41:21.917 --> 00:41:23.554

00:41:47.008 --> 00:41:49.041

00:44:53.931 --> 00:44:55.766
- I swallowed it.
- Oh. that's a bummer.

00:44:55.801 --> 00:44:57.625
Spit it out.
You need to spit it out!

899
00:46:31.688 --> 00:46:33.424
Oh!

900
00:46:35.395 --> 00:46:39.001
I'm free!

901
00:46:39.036 --> 00:46:43.500
Whee!

902
00:46:43.535 --> 00:46:45.909
Ya mon!

903
00:46:49.508 --> 00:46:51.739
We did it!

904
00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.956
Thank you!

905
00:47:02.158 --> 00:47:04.059
Whoo! Oh. you did it.

906
00:47:04.094 --> 00:47:05.324
I can't believe it.

907
00:47:05.359 --> 00:47:07.623
I was in a cage.
and now I'm not.

908
00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:09.130
In. and now not.

909
00:47:09.165 --> 00:47:11.363
And you did it!

910
00:47:11.398 --> 00:47:12.628
All of you.

911
00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:14.267
But you...

912
00:47:14.302 --> 00:47:16.302
- you wild duck. you.

913
00:47:16.337 --> 00:47:18.634
You must be the bravest duck
me ever meet.

914
00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:19.976
Oh. I'm not that...

915
00:47:21.408 --> 00:47:22.638
I'm not that brave.

916
00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:24.112
What?! You knew the danger.

917
00:47:24.147 --> 00:47:26.246
You did it anyway.
What do you call that?

918
00:47:26.281 --> 00:47:27.808
Yeah. you're right.

919
00:47:27.843 --> 00:47:31.416
I guess that is the only word
that describes who I am.

920
00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:34.089
Did you hear that?
He called me brave.

921
00:47:34.124 --> 00:47:36.058
So you want to go
to my island. eh?

922
00:47:36.093 --> 00:47:38.324
I will be honored
to take you there myself.

923
00:47:38.359 --> 00:47:40.128
You'd do that?

924
00:47:40.163 --> 00:47:42.823
For you. me do anything.

925
00:47:42.858 --> 00:47:46.860
because I can do anything!

926
00:47:46.895 --> 00:47:48.169
Woo-hoo!

927
00:47:48.204 --> 00:47:50.897
I can go here.
or I could go here.

928
00:47:50.932 --> 00:47:53.009
Free as a bird!

929
00:47:53.044 --> 00:47:54.274
Right.

930
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:57.981
'Cause I'm a bird!

931
00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:02.414
I didn't think
I'd ever say this. but. uh.

932
00:48:02.449 --> 00:48:05.318
you are one heck of a bird.

933
00:48:05.353 --> 00:48:07.485
Oh. Well. thanks. Chump.

934
00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.059
You're not so bad yourself.

935
00:48:11.854 --> 00:48:14.195
Yeah. you know. I'm getting
a little waterwork-y up here.

936
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:16.197
Scram. you crazy ducks.

937
00:48:16.232 --> 00:48:17.825
Get out of here.

938
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:19.200
- Bye. Chump.
- Bye-bye. Chump.

939
00:48:19.235 --> 00:48:20.663
- Bye. Chump.
- Thank you!

940
00:48:20.698 --> 00:48:21.928
Thanks for everything.

941
00:48:21.963 --> 00:48:23.501
So long. Chump.

942
00:48:23.536 --> 00:48:26.537
Don't forget
where you got that sandwich.

943
00:48:30.015 --> 00:48:32.015
Bye-bye. you country bumpkins.

944
00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:33.907
I love you.

945
00:48:54.633 --> 00:48:56.336
I can't believe it!

946
00:48:56.371 --> 00:48:58.404
In a few hours.
we'll reach the coast.

947
00:48:58.439 --> 00:49:00.241
Then a little hop
over the ocean.

948
00:49:00.276 --> 00:49:03.244
and we'll finally get
to my homeland!

949
00:49:03.279 --> 00:49:05.675
Hey. uh. Delroy. uh. is it true

950
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:08.777
that the sea glows at night
in Jamaica?

951
00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:12.286
Because that sounds
incredibly magical.

952
00:49:12.321 --> 00:49:14.024
Ah.

953
00:49:14.059 --> 00:49:15.619
You hear about that. eh?

954
00:49:15.654 --> 00:49:18.589
Whatever you're expecting
over there...

955
00:49:18.624 --> 00:49:21.658
it's going to be even better.

956
00:49:23.068 --> 00:49:26.696
Jamaica. I'm coming home!

957
00:49:26.731 --> 00:49:29.237
- ♪ I'm coming. I'm coming ♪
- Mom?

958
00:49:29.272 --> 00:49:31.239
- ♪ I'm coming home. ♪
- Hmm?

959
00:49:32.638 --> 00:49:33.769
It's really bad.

960
00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:35.408
Oh. It's okay. Gwen.

961
00:49:35.443 --> 00:49:37.047
You can do it while we fly.

962
00:49:37.082 --> 00:49:39.247
Here? But anyone could see me.

963
00:49:39.282 --> 00:49:40.974
No one's watching. Gwen.

964
00:49:41.009 --> 00:49:42.877
You know what?
I'll go up front.

965
00:49:42.912 --> 00:49:44.846
-  What's happening?

966
00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:46.386
We have a number two situation.

967
00:49:46.421 --> 00:49:47.684
Oh.

968
00:49:47.719 --> 00:49:49.356
- Everything okay back there?
- Dad! Don't look!

969
00:49:49.391 --> 00:49:50.885
- Oh! Sorry. Gwen.
- What are you doing?

970
00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.425
My bad. My bad.

971
00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.724
Mom. I can't do it here.

972
00:49:54.759 --> 00:49:56.066
Can we land?

973
00:49:56.101 --> 00:49:57.430
No. we won't land. Gwen.

974
00:49:57.465 --> 00:49:59.025
You're old enough
to do it in the sky now.

975
00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:02.270
But it's too much pressure.
and it's gross.

976
00:50:02.305 --> 00:50:04.173
It's not gross. We're birds.

977
00:50:04.208 --> 00:50:05.834
Every bird does it in the sky.

978
00:50:05.869 --> 00:50:07.935
What if someone is looking
down there?

979
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:09.541
No one is looking down there.

980
00:50:09.576 --> 00:50:11.213
I told you. we are not landing.

981
00:50:11.248 --> 00:50:13.347
There is no way we're landing.

982
00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.350
Are you sure no one's watching?

983
00:50:16.385 --> 00:50:17.549
Gwen Mallard!

984
00:50:17.584 --> 00:50:19.287
Do it now
or we leave without you.

985
00:50:19.322 --> 00:50:21.014
- Okay. okay.
- Ugh!

986
00:50:21.049 --> 00:50:22.587
She's perfectly capable of
doing her business in the sky.

987
00:50:22.622 --> 00:50:23.984
- and yet here we are.
- It's okay. Pam.

988
00:50:24.019 --> 00:50:25.326
Just let her be.

989
00:50:25.361 --> 00:50:27.020
Does anybody have a soft moss?

990
00:50:27.055 --> 00:50:28.923
Just use a leaf!

991
00:50:30.498 --> 00:50:32.300
Someone's watching!
Someone's watching!

992
00:50:32.335 --> 00:50:34.665
- There! Someone's watching!
- Where? Where?

993
00:50:37.637 --> 00:50:39.065
Huh.

994
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:49.482
Hmm.

995
00:50:49.517 --> 00:50:52.452
Follow me. and stay close.

996
00:50:52.487 --> 00:50:54.388
Whoa! For real. Dad?

997
00:50:55.226 --> 00:50:56.522
Mm-hmm.

998
00:50:56.557 --> 00:50:57.490
Cool.

999
00:50:57.525 --> 00:50:59.195
I like your spirit. duck man.

1000
00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:00.955
- Um...

1001
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:03.397
- Hmm.
Guys?

1002
00:51:04.697 --> 00:51:06.334
Mm-hmm.

1003
00:51:06.369 --> 00:51:08.237
Uh. are you sure this is safe?

1004
00:51:08.272 --> 00:51:09.667
Don't worry.

1005
00:51:09.702 --> 00:51:12.065
That wild duck is on
a journey of the soul.

1006
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.770
and I say we follow him.

1007
00:51:13.805 --> 00:51:16.102
But just in case.
get out your talons.

1008
00:51:17.578 --> 00:51:20.249
I ain't sure ducks
have talons. though.

1009
00:51:20.284 --> 00:51:22.251
Shh. shh.

1010
00:51:31.559 --> 00:51:34.395
GOOGOO
Now stretch your back

1011
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:38.927
and move your wings
up to the sky.

1012
00:51:38.962 --> 00:51:40.764
Breathe in.

1013
00:51:40.799 --> 00:51:46.836
- And breathe out.

1014
00:51:46.871 --> 00:51:49.542
Excellent. class.

1015
00:51:49.577 --> 00:51:52.776
And now the egg position.

1016
00:51:55.418 --> 00:51:57.385
And we hatch

1017
00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:01.356
with a newborn quack.

1018
00:52:01.391 --> 00:52:03.589
Quack.

1019
00:52:03.624 --> 00:52:05.228
Very good.

1020
00:52:05.263 --> 00:52:06.889
And repeat.

1021
00:52:06.924 --> 00:52:09.430
Quack.

1022
00:52:09.465 --> 00:52:11.564
And repeat.
Quack.

1023
00:52:11.599 --> 00:52:13.632
And repeat.

1024
00:52:13.667 --> 00:52:15.601
Hey. what's going on here?

1025
00:52:15.636 --> 00:52:17.768
- Visitors!

1026
00:52:19.904 --> 00:52:21.442
Brothers. brothers.

1027
00:52:21.477 --> 00:52:23.169
Sisters. hold your enthusiasm.

1028
00:52:23.204 --> 00:52:26.040
We-we don't want to scare
our guests away. do we?

1029
00:52:26.075 --> 00:52:28.174
Hello. friends.

1030
00:52:28.209 --> 00:52:29.648
I am Googoo.

1031
00:52:29.683 --> 00:52:32.552
Welcome to our humble abode.

1032
00:52:32.587 --> 00:52:35.390
Abode? What is going on here?

1033
00:52:35.425 --> 00:52:37.623
Our morning relaxation

1034
00:52:37.658 --> 00:52:41.264
as we prepare for
the glorious Earl and Mae

1035
00:52:41.299 --> 00:52:44.663
to open the gates to paradise.

1036
00:52:44.698 --> 00:52:46.962
- Oh. you're so lucky.

1037
00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:48.799
You're just in time.

1038
00:53:01.286 --> 00:53:02.912
My friends...

1039
00:53:02.947 --> 00:53:07.323
welcome to
the Garden of Harmony.

1040
00:53:15.861 --> 00:53:18.367
I don't understand. It's...

1041
00:53:18.402 --> 00:53:20.226
Heaven for ducks?

1042
00:53:20.261 --> 00:53:21.766
Yep. pretty much.

1043
00:53:37.784 --> 00:53:39.949
Ah. Perfect.

1044
00:53:40.985 --> 00:53:42.083
Whee!

1045
00:53:56.803 --> 00:54:00.200
You came to the perfect place.
my friends.

1046
00:54:00.235 --> 00:54:05.073
Here. humans spare no expense
on our well-being.

1047
00:54:05.108 --> 00:54:08.175
And they just finished building
our brand-new slide.

1048
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:10.144
Yeah!

1049
00:54:10.179 --> 00:54:12.245
So please be our guest.

1050
00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:14.522
Feel free to enjoy our place

1051
00:54:14.557 --> 00:54:16.788
- for as long as you like.

1052
00:54:16.823 --> 00:54:18.559
Whoa.

1053
00:54:18.594 --> 00:54:22.057
Well. I guess we could
take the afternoon.

1054
00:54:23.731 --> 00:54:25.467
- Come on. Please.
- Come on. Come on. Dad. please.

1055
00:54:25.502 --> 00:54:27.194
- Come on. Let's stay. Stay.
- Please. please.

1056
00:54:27.229 --> 00:54:28.701
Oh. no. No. no. no.

1057
00:54:28.736 --> 00:54:30.340
I don't think
we can possibly stay here...

1058
00:54:31.805 --> 00:54:35.004
...without having
the best time of our lives!

1059
00:54:35.039 --> 00:54:37.237
Now. get out there
and have some fun.

1060
00:54:38.779 --> 00:54:40.548
Slides. here I come!
Wait for me!

1061
00:54:40.583 --> 00:54:42.946
Slippy slides!

1062
00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:49.458
Woo-hoo! Whoa!

1063
00:54:55.631 --> 00:54:58.896
Here comes the sea dragon!

1064
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:05.540
We're gonna get you!

1065
00:55:05.575 --> 00:55:07.740
We're gonna squish
your sea dragon face!

1066
00:55:07.775 --> 00:55:09.742
Sea dragon is hungry.

1067
00:55:09.777 --> 00:55:11.205
Hi-yah!

1068
00:55:13.176 --> 00:55:15.616
We need to slay the sea dragon!

1069
00:55:17.015 --> 00:55:18.520
Ow. Gwen.

1070
00:55:18.555 --> 00:55:20.115
- Gwen. be more careful.

1071
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.183
- We need to slay him gently.

1072
00:55:22.218 --> 00:55:24.086
Really? Okay.

1073
00:55:27.058 --> 00:55:28.464
Ow! Uncle Dan.

1074
00:55:28.499 --> 00:55:30.466
What? I want to play. too.

1075
00:55:30.501 --> 00:55:32.699
Sea dragon needs a break.

1076
00:55:32.734 --> 00:55:34.998
- Ow! Gwen!

1077
00:55:55.416 --> 00:55:58.527
Brothers. sisters. great news!

1078
00:55:58.562 --> 00:56:01.563
Earl and Mae are taking us
on a field trip.

1079
00:56:01.598 --> 00:56:03.499
- I'm so excited.

1080
00:56:03.534 --> 00:56:05.094
It's so great. Hurry. guys.

1081
00:56:05.129 --> 00:56:06.260
Hurry. It's time.

1082
00:56:06.295 --> 00:56:08.262
You don't want to miss this.

1083
00:56:08.297 --> 00:56:10.330
Come on. everyone. Let's go.

1084
00:56:14.006 --> 00:56:16.006
No! No. no. no. no. no. no. no!

1085
00:56:16.041 --> 00:56:18.239
I'm so excited.
I can't wait to get started.

1086
00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:19.713
Googoo. stop!

1087
00:56:19.748 --> 00:56:21.407
What is it. my little friend?

1088
00:56:21.442 --> 00:56:22.881
The-the chef. The-the...

1089
00:56:24.379 --> 00:56:26.082
You want to come. too?

1090
00:56:26.117 --> 00:56:27.985
- Come on. Let's go.
- You got to stop.

1091
00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:30.526
- Last one is a rotten egg.
- Googoo! Stop!

1092
00:56:30.561 --> 00:56:31.956
- Googoo!
- Kneel. sea dragon. kneel!

1093
00:56:31.991 --> 00:56:33.727
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. Gwenny.

1094
00:56:33.762 --> 00:56:35.091
- Googoo. no! Stop!
- No. Don't hit your father.

1095
00:56:35.126 --> 00:56:36.763
- What?
- We're not hitting fathers.

1096
00:56:36.798 --> 00:56:38.468
Googoo! Googoo!
- Where are you going?

1097
00:56:38.503 --> 00:56:40.668
Uh. Delroy is
the sea dragon now.

1098
00:56:40.703 --> 00:56:42.604
Of course. I'd love that.

1099
00:56:42.639 --> 00:56:44.133
- You're next!
- No. no. no.

1100
00:56:44.168 --> 00:56:45.706
You're gonna be gentle.
Okay. no... -

1101
00:56:45.741 --> 00:56:47.037
- Ow!
- Gwenny. come on!

1102
00:56:47.072 --> 00:56:48.775
- He said "gently."

1103
00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:50.139
Googoo. he's gonna take you
to his kitchen.

1104
00:56:50.174 --> 00:56:51.712
- Come on.
- He's gonna serve you

1105
00:56:51.747 --> 00:56:52.911
to people. with oranges.

1106
00:56:52.946 --> 00:56:54.517
Hey. hey. What's happening?

1107
00:56:54.552 --> 00:56:57.047
Dad. it's the chef. He's back.

1108
00:57:01.955 --> 00:57:04.252
Earl and Mae are giving
those ducks to the chef

1109
00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.594
so he can cook them.

1110
00:57:05.629 --> 00:57:06.958
I beg your pardon?

1111
00:57:06.993 --> 00:57:09.664
Dax. go back to Mom.
I'll handle this.

1112
00:57:09.699 --> 00:57:11.600
No! I can help! I can just...

1113
00:57:11.635 --> 00:57:12.964
Go back to Mom now!

1114
00:57:12.999 --> 00:57:14.702
Googoo. do not get
on that truck.

1115
00:57:14.737 --> 00:57:16.132
Look. I understand this is all

1116
00:57:16.167 --> 00:57:18.134
new to you--
bit weird. bit strange...

1117
00:57:18.169 --> 00:57:19.938
Don't you get it? It's a trap!

1118
00:57:19.973 --> 00:57:21.643
We've got to get your ducks
out of here!

1119
00:57:21.678 --> 00:57:23.579
Everyone. get off the truck
unless you want to be cooked!

1120
00:57:23.614 --> 00:57:24.811
- Cooked?

1121
00:57:24.846 --> 00:57:25.713
- What?
- Wait. what's that?

1122
00:57:25.748 --> 00:57:27.275
Come on! Hurry!

1123
00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:29.552
You got to go
before he comes back.

1124
00:57:38.024 --> 00:57:39.122
Let go!

1125
00:57:39.157 --> 00:57:41.091
- Earl and Mae are our leaders.
- Dax?

1126
00:57:41.126 --> 00:57:43.390
- They massage us.
- Dax!

1127
00:58:00.178 --> 00:58:02.618
Everyone. run! Now!

1128
00:58:09.055 --> 00:58:11.561
- Pam. the chef!
- What?

1129
00:58:11.596 --> 00:58:13.387
We have to get out of here now!

1130
00:58:13.422 --> 00:58:14.960
Go. go. go!

1131
00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:18.128
Okay. let's go.

1132
00:58:18.163 --> 00:58:20.229
Let's go. let's go. let's go!
Go. go. go. go. go!

1133
00:58:20.264 --> 00:58:22.132
Everyone. take off!

1134
00:58:24.103 --> 00:58:26.235
Dax. on my back!

1135
00:58:28.272 --> 00:58:30.470
Hurry!

1136
00:58:53.429 --> 00:58:55.704
Guys. we need to rest.

1137
00:58:55.739 --> 00:58:57.332
Follow me.

1138
00:59:08.213 --> 00:59:10.279
Guys. are you okay?
What happened?

1139
00:59:10.314 --> 00:59:12.446
- Mom. he was coming for the...
- I'll tell you what happened.

1140
00:59:12.481 --> 00:59:15.581
I told him to stay back. and
he almost got himself killed.

1141
00:59:15.616 --> 00:59:17.924
But. Dad. I was trying to help.

1142
00:59:17.959 --> 00:59:19.662
I don't need your help. Dax.

1143
00:59:19.697 --> 00:59:21.455
I need you to do what I say!

1144
00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:23.864
Do you understand?!

1145
00:59:31.533 --> 00:59:32.972
Listen. Dax.

1146
00:59:33.007 --> 00:59:35.711
Just let us grown-ups
figure it out while...

1147
00:59:40.949 --> 00:59:43.114
All right. everyone.
let's call it a night.

1148
00:59:43.952 --> 00:59:46.183
We could use the rest.

1149
01:00:57.454 --> 01:00:59.652
Gwen. you scared me.

1150
01:00:59.687 --> 01:01:01.555
You look mad.

1151
01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:03.766
You need a hug!

1152
01:01:04.659 --> 01:01:06.736
No. Gwen. I don't need a hug.

1153
01:01:06.771 --> 01:01:08.397
- Whoa! I said no hug.

1154
01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:11.037
Don't fight it.
It'll make you feel better.

1155
01:01:14.845 --> 01:01:16.174
Can you let go now?

1156
01:01:16.209 --> 01:01:18.011
- You feel better?
- No.

1157
01:01:18.046 --> 01:01:20.409
Then it hasn't kicked in yet.

1158
01:01:24.118 --> 01:01:25.854
- What about now?
- No.

1159
01:01:25.889 --> 01:01:27.449
- Now?
- Mm-mm.

1160
01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:28.714
- Now?
- Nothing.

1161
01:01:28.749 --> 01:01:30.155
- A little?
- Nope.

1162
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:31.684
I felt something.

1163
01:01:31.719 --> 01:01:33.224
Mm-mm.

1164
01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.212
- Oh. no. he's back!

1165
01:01:54.247 --> 01:01:56.214
- Every duck for himself!

1166
01:01:56.249 --> 01:01:57.787
- Kids!
- Dax! Gwen!

1167
01:02:04.785 --> 01:02:06.521
- Mom! Dad!
No. no. no!

1168
01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:09.359
- No. no! Dax. Gwen. stay back!
- No! Stop!

1169
01:02:10.164 --> 01:02:11.691
- Get out of here now!
- Go hide!

1170
01:02:11.726 --> 01:02:13.363
- Hide. kids! Go!
Go. go!

1171
01:02:28.281 --> 01:02:31.051
No.

1172
01:02:33.286 --> 01:02:34.780
No. no. no.
Mom!

1173
01:02:34.815 --> 01:02:36.958
- Mom. Dad. no!
- Daddy!

1174
01:02:36.993 --> 01:02:39.752
- Oh. kids! Oh. kids!
- No!

1175
01:02:39.787 --> 01:02:42.462
- No!

1176
01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:46.423
He's gonna cook Mom and Dad.
isn't he?

1177
01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:48.854
And he's gonna come back for us.

1178
01:03:48.889 --> 01:03:51.560
- And he'll cook us. too!

1179
01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:56.004
I wish we tasted awful!

1180
01:03:56.039 --> 01:03:58.270
Gwen. we're not giving up. okay?

1181
01:03:58.305 --> 01:04:00.536
We're-we're gonna
figure something out.

1182
01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:02.912
We are?

1183
01:04:02.947 --> 01:04:04.771
Yes. There has to be a way.

1184
01:04:04.806 --> 01:04:06.608
But-but how?

1185
01:04:06.643 --> 01:04:08.511
You can't even fly.

1186
01:04:08.546 --> 01:04:10.018
Oh. we're doomed.

1187
01:04:24.067 --> 01:04:27.002
Gwen. you're a genius.

1188
01:04:27.972 --> 01:04:29.697
Am I?

1189
01:04:35.078 --> 01:04:38.508
We are not getting cooked today.

1190
01:04:41.986 --> 01:04:43.447
Come on. Pam. keep going.

1191
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:48.881
Pam?

1192
01:04:48.916 --> 01:04:50.421
It's hopeless. Mack.

1193
01:04:50.456 --> 01:04:53.127
What? No. no. no. no. no.
it's not hopeless.

1194
01:04:53.162 --> 01:04:55.492
- We can do this.
- No. we've lost them.

1195
01:04:55.527 --> 01:04:57.967
Mack. we've lost the kids.
You were right.

1196
01:04:58.002 --> 01:05:00.200
We never ever should have
left the pond.

1197
01:05:00.235 --> 01:05:01.630
Pam. enough.

1198
01:05:01.665 --> 01:05:03.269
This isn't you.

1199
01:05:03.304 --> 01:05:06.140
You're the adventurous one.
the-the-the brave one.

1200
01:05:06.175 --> 01:05:08.142
You never give up on anything.

1201
01:05:08.177 --> 01:05:11.673
You-you haven't even
given up on me.

1202
01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:13.312
Come on. Pam.

1203
01:05:13.347 --> 01:05:14.984
You've proven
over and over again

1204
01:05:15.019 --> 01:05:17.844
that when everything
is hopeless. we have to be...

1205
01:05:17.879 --> 01:05:19.615
Optimistic.

1206
01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:23.355
Yes. And now you and me are
going to get our kids back

1207
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:27.260
so we can finish this crazy.
wonderful adventure.

1208
01:05:27.295 --> 01:05:29.955
And we are going to show them
that when danger strikes.

1209
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:31.891
you do not run from it.

1210
01:05:31.926 --> 01:05:34.432
You take a stand.

1211
01:05:35.468 --> 01:05:37.303
That's it! Look. Pa...

1212
01:05:37.338 --> 01:05:39.635
- Shh! Shh. shh.

1213
01:05:41.606 --> 01:05:42.869
We can do this.

1214
01:05:42.904 --> 01:05:45.245
Mack. Mack. we can do this.

1215
01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.016
Come on. Let's go.

1216
01:05:47.051 --> 01:05:48.545
Okay.

1217
01:05:49.911 --> 01:05:51.449
- Left. Pam.

1218
01:05:51.484 --> 01:05:53.088
- Just... You do your left.
- No. no. no. no. Right.

1219
01:05:53.123 --> 01:05:54.749
Okay. you're moving
on the left. Move on the top.

1220
01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:57.125
- Just set...
- Okay. no. no. no. no. no.

1221
01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:01.030
- Psst. Hey. Over here. Here.
- Hey. Hey.

1222
01:06:01.065 --> 01:06:02.262
- Here.
- Do it together.

1223
01:06:02.297 --> 01:06:03.725
- Ya mon. Together.
- Do it together.

1224
01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.958
Wh-Wh-What?

1225
01:06:07.335 --> 01:06:10.270
Together.

1226
01:07:00.553 --> 01:07:01.387
Hmm?

1227
01:07:01.422 --> 01:07:04.588
You trap me for years.

1228
01:07:04.623 --> 01:07:08.020
now you're trying
to cook my friends?

1229
01:07:08.055 --> 01:07:09.362
Enough!

1230
01:07:09.397 --> 01:07:13.861
It is payback time!

1231
01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:15.830
Payback!

1232
01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.247
Reload.

1233
01:07:26.282 --> 01:07:28.216
Ah...

1234
01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:36.587
Eat this.

1235
01:08:38.046 --> 01:08:39.980
- What?

1236
01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:44.985
We're coming!

1237
01:08:52.126 --> 01:08:53.466
Dax!

1238
01:08:53.501 --> 01:08:56.238
- We got this. guys.

1239
01:09:04.908 --> 01:09:08.316
We can do this!

1240
01:09:11.783 --> 01:09:13.387
Mom!

1241
01:09:13.422 --> 01:09:16.225
Kids! Oh. kids.

1242
01:09:32.969 --> 01:09:35.134
Woo-hoo!

1243
01:09:37.842 --> 01:09:40.205
Ya mon!

1244
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:49.016
Everyone!

1245
01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.358
Delroy. you made it!

1246
01:09:50.393 --> 01:09:52.954
- You're alive!

1247
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:56.265
I'm so happy to see you.

1248
01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:00.533
And you. all dressed up
for Jamaica.

1249
01:10:00.568 --> 01:10:01.963
- Look at you!

1250
01:10:01.998 --> 01:10:05.703
Well. come on.
Let's go. go. go. go. go!

1251
01:10:37.836 --> 01:10:40.001
We're almost there. everyone.

1252
01:10:40.036 --> 01:10:42.036
I can feel it!

1253
01:10:45.679 --> 01:10:49.351
Okay. so we're a bit lost.

1254
01:10:49.386 --> 01:10:51.419
Must have missed a turn
somewhere.

1255
01:10:51.454 --> 01:10:53.212
But don't worry.

1256
01:10:53.247 --> 01:10:56.622
We just have to go back
to the big green statue.

1257
01:11:05.633 --> 01:11:08.062
- Pam?
- Hmm?

1258
01:11:16.842 --> 01:11:19.238
Mack. the water.

1259
01:11:19.273 --> 01:11:21.482
It's glowing.

1260
01:11:21.517 --> 01:11:23.143
It's glowing.

1261
01:11:23.178 --> 01:11:24.485
It's real.

1262
01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.455
The water is glowing!

1263
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:32.427
Dad. Dad!

1264
01:11:32.462 --> 01:11:34.429
Come look.

1265
01:11:44.034 --> 01:11:45.198
That's it.

1266
01:11:45.233 --> 01:11:46.804
That's Jamaica.

1267
01:11:59.247 --> 01:12:01.049
Well. what are you waiting for?

1268
01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:03.282
Lead the way.

1269
01:12:05.627 --> 01:12:08.023
- Gwen. final check. please.

1270
01:12:08.058 --> 01:12:09.464
Aye. Captain.

1271
01:12:09.499 --> 01:12:11.026

Check.

1273
01:12:12.359 --> 01:12:13.600

Check.

1275
01:12:14.735 --> 01:12:16.504
Heads in Bake-Off mode?

1276
01:12:16.539 --> 01:12:18.539
- Takeoff mode.
- Takeoff mode?

1277
01:12:18.574 --> 01:12:19.936

No. Gwenny. you cannot take
Toothpick back home.

1342
01:16:02.127 --> 01:16:04.556
But Toothpick wants to come.

1343

So. we're ready for takeoff?

1348
01:16:17.846 --> 01:16:19.912
Wait. Where's your father?

1349
01:16:19.947 --> 01:16:21.573
Guys! Guys!

1350
01:16:21.608 --> 01:16:24.114
Guys!

1351
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:26.182
I just met these birds
who are totally lost.

1352
01:16:26.217 --> 01:16:27.887
I said we'd help 'em get home.

1353
01:16:27.922 --> 01:16:29.658
What do you say?

1354
01:16:29.693 --> 01:16:31.616
Hello.

1355
01:16:31.651 --> 01:16:33.662
- Hi. Hello.
Hi.

1356
01:16:33.697 --> 01:16:35.455
Mack. you do know

1357
01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:37.523
that penguins are from
the South Pole?

1358
01:16:37.558 --> 01:16:39.030
I know! Isn't that great?

1359
01:16:39.065 --> 01:16:40.229
GWEN and DAX:
Yeah!

1360
01:16:40.264 --> 01:16:41.934
We're going to the South Pole!

1361
01:16:41.969 --> 01:16:44.563
No. I'm not going. No way.

1362
01:16:44.598 --> 01:16:46.840
Oh. please. Uncle Dan.

1363
01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:48.600

Okay. okay.

We're going to the South Pole.

1367
01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:58.984
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1368
01:16:59.019 --> 01:17:01.756
Come on. Pam.
We're going to the South Pole.

1369
01:17:01.791 --> 01:17:04.286
I've created a monster.

1370
01:17:04.321 --> 01:17:06.123
Okay. so let's talk itinerary.

1371
01:17:06.158 --> 01:17:09.060
I say Costa Rica. Panama.
Amazon River.

1372
01:17:09.095 --> 01:17:10.765
- Any other ideas?
Oh. oh!

1373
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.525
I want to see Titicaca!

1374
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.527
Titicaca! Great.
