00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:54.242
this is weird. right?

538
00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:57.078
One question I would love
to just sort of kick off

539
00:24:57.162 --> 00:25:01.875
is. like. what is your. um.

540
00:25:01.917 --> 00:25:04.085
your American story?

541
00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:07.047
Our theory
that divisions in America

542
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.174
are rooted in politics

543
00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:12.052
got completely blown up
on Day One.

544
00:25:12.093 --> 00:25:14.804
Being called "illegal"
and being called a "wetback"

545
00:25:14.888 --> 00:25:17.807
and. you know.
every time I hear them.

546
00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:21.186
it's--it's dehumanizing.

547
00:25:21.228 --> 00:25:23.730
We learned very quickly
that our political divisions

548
00:25:23.813 --> 00:25:25.732
are more symptomatic
of something

549
00:25:25.815 --> 00:25:27.984
that goes a lot deeper.

550
00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:30.320
There's a huge division
in our country right now

551
00:25:30.403 --> 00:25:32.531
and. yeah. we wanted
to maybe see if we could

552
00:25:32.572 --> 00:25:34.908
start a little bit
of a conversation

553
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.786
to try and break down
some walls of division.

554
00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:41.873
Generally speaking. um.

555
00:25:41.915 --> 00:25:45.085
I'd have to honestly say
that I don't have

556
00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:48.421
a really great feeling
towards white people.

557
00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:53.176
Um. a lot of it is because of
some of my experiences

558
00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.429
and some of what I've seen
my parents experience.

559
00:25:56.513 --> 00:25:59.599
I went into labor
with my first child

560
00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:02.227
when I was seven months along.

561
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:05.480
and my water broke while I was
walking around the mall

562
00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:06.606
with my dad.

563
00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.733
He was buying baby clothes.

564
00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:11.111
And I went to the hospital.

565
00:26:11.194 --> 00:26:13.154
The nurse came in. and I said.

566
00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:14.781
"I think I'm having
contractions."

567
00:26:14.864 --> 00:26:17.659
and she examined me
very quickly and she said.

568
00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:19.619
"Oh. you're not ready
to have this baby yet.

569
00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:21.079
You call me back in here
when you're ready

570
00:26:21.121 --> 00:26:22.455
to have this baby."

571
00:26:22.497 --> 00:26:25.625
And they let me lay there
for hours.

572
00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:28.878
By the time the doctor came.
I was crowning.

573
00:26:28.962 --> 00:26:32.465
-Wow.
-And my first baby died.

574
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:36.469
and I know that they did not
give me the care

575
00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:38.680
and the attention
that I deserved.

576
00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:42.809
I lost my baby
because they did not provide

577
00:26:42.892 --> 00:26:45.687

582

as if they're criminals.

583

00:40:52.158 --> 00:40:53.576
These are just
small little things.

888
00:40:53.659 --> 00:40:56.620
but we saw how it manifests
still today

889
00:40:56.662 --> 00:40:59.582
in our communities.
and it was shocking to us.

890
00:40:59.665 --> 00:41:01.500
When did prayer come involved?

891
00:41:01.542 --> 00:41:02.835
How much does God matter

892
00:41:02.918 --> 00:41:05.337
in terms of what
you're doing together?

893
00:41:05.379 --> 00:41:08.966
And how would you. you know.
you can be candid with us.

894
00:41:09.008 --> 00:41:10.384
who is God to you?

895
00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:13.012
I don't want to impose
my faith on others.

896
00:41:13.095 --> 00:41:16.891
but. for us. God is everything.

897
00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:18.267
I'm gonna push back
just a little bit.

898
00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:21.437
-Yeah.
-Um. you began with the premise

899
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.857
that things are broken.
but would you agree

900
00:41:24.899 --> 00:41:27.151
that not everyone agrees
on what is broken?

901
00:41:27.193 --> 00:41:28.986
-Of course. yeah.
-There are a lot of people

902
00:41:29.028 --> 00:41:30.863
who'd say. "Well.
politics isn't designed

903
00:41:30.905 --> 00:41:32.364
to solve all these problems

904
00:41:32.406 --> 00:41:33.908
that you've talked
about tonight."

905
00:41:33.991 --> 00:41:35.701
But we want to share
these stories

906
00:41:35.743 --> 00:41:37.119
with the people from our world

907
00:41:37.203 --> 00:41:38.746
who don't know
that there's a problem.

908
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:41.499
But I think the hard part
is to talk about these things

909
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.460
in platitudes. because I think
every one of us would say.

910
00:41:44.543 --> 00:41:46.795
"Yeah. there are things
that are broken."

911
00:41:46.879 --> 00:41:48.422
but we wouldn't
necessarily agree

912
00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:51.050
with what they are
and what the solution is.

913
00:41:51.133 --> 00:41:53.302
I've seen a level of brokenness
in this country

914
00:41:53.385 --> 00:41:55.179
that you haven't seen.
and you've seen a level

915
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:57.389
of unbrokenness
that I haven't seen.

916
00:41:57.473 --> 00:41:59.934
And that's why
it's super difficult

917
00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:02.895
to get everyone. as you say.
to do this thing

918
00:42:02.978 --> 00:42:04.230
that's reconciliation.

919
00:42:04.313 --> 00:42:07.316
I guess part of it
is kind of me thinking.

920
00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:09.610
I wonder if
it's even possible.

921
00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:11.904
I don't know if it's possible.

922
00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:22.081
♪

923
00:42:30.005 --> 00:42:31.257
If you look very closely.
you can see

924
00:42:31.298 --> 00:42:34.051
that her ear is kind of closed.

925
00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:38.264
When Heather was born.
she only had one ear open.

926
00:42:38.347 --> 00:42:41.350
That encouraged her
to be more recognizing

927
00:42:41.433 --> 00:42:44.228
of people being treated
unfairly.

928
00:42:45.437 --> 00:42:49.525
I learned a lot from her
over the years.

929
00:42:49.608 --> 00:42:52.611
I was struggling to understand
white privilege

930
00:42:52.653 --> 00:42:55.114
'cause I thought.
"My parents and I worked

931
00:42:55.155 --> 00:42:57.283
for everything we got."

932
00:42:57.324 --> 00:43:01.453
My kids grew up being called
"trailer trash."

933
00:43:01.495 --> 00:43:04.331
but that's not what
white privilege is about.

934
00:43:06.625 --> 00:43:09.169
(engine puttering)

935
00:43:13.966 --> 00:43:18.012
Your daughter was fighting
the real fight. was she not?

936
00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:20.639
And you taught her that.

937
00:43:20.681 --> 00:43:24.101
And so. here in Cleveland.
the same thing is going on.

938
00:43:24.143 --> 00:43:26.979
because it is when things
like this happen

939
00:43:27.062 --> 00:43:29.148
that we see the true power.

940
00:43:29.231 --> 00:43:31.692
It was an incident
that happened that...

941
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.487
It really screwed
with our lives.

942
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:37.823
I'm trying not to get
emotional. I'm sorry.

943
00:43:37.865 --> 00:43:39.366
My 15-year-old sister.

944
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.494
she was jumped
at busted her teeth.

945
00:43:42.536 --> 00:43:44.830
I tell my mom
to call the police.

946
00:43:44.913 --> 00:43:46.206
Make a police report

947
00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.666
'cause that's all we can do.

948
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.628
My mom tried everything.
doin' it the right way.

949
00:43:50.669 --> 00:43:53.797
and we got charged
with felony two.

950
00:43:53.839 --> 00:43:55.341
Oh!

951
00:43:55.382 --> 00:43:57.760
It's a hard struggle.

952
00:43:57.843 --> 00:43:59.428
Um. a couple of things.

953
00:43:59.511 --> 00:44:02.598
I wear today Angelo Miller.

954
00:44:02.681 --> 00:44:05.684
Angelo Miller
was killed by police.

955
00:44:05.768 --> 00:44:08.562
and I wanna say I thank you

956
00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:09.688
for standing up

957
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.107
for people who can't
stand up for themselves.

958
00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:13.150
-Amen!
-I just wanted

959
00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:15.110
to come here and say that.

960
00:44:15.194 --> 00:44:17.696
What I hear from you guys.
unfortunately.

961
00:44:17.738 --> 00:44:19.198
I hear a lot of places.

962
00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:21.241
And believe it or not.
there are still a lot of people

963
00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:23.494
who would never
believe your story.

964
00:44:23.535 --> 00:44:26.497
I know your story is true.
I have heard that story

965
00:44:26.538 --> 00:44:29.041
in so many places
across the country.

966
00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:32.252
So. we have a lot of work to do.

967
00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:33.879
Thank you so much.

968
00:44:33.962 --> 00:44:36.423
(applause)

969
00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:38.300
A lot of people think that

970
00:44:38.384 --> 00:44:41.387
there are no
racial issues whatsoever.

971
00:44:41.428 --> 00:44:44.556
Why are we treating
people unequally?

972
00:44:44.598 --> 00:44:45.766
Thank you.

973
00:44:47.935 --> 00:44:49.228
When any of us is marginalized.

974
00:44:49.311 --> 00:44:51.772
-we are all marginalized.
-That's right.

975
00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:53.565
That's right.

976
00:44:53.649 --> 00:44:55.693
Part of the reason
I do what I do

977
00:44:55.734 --> 00:44:59.029
is because parents
are losing their kids

978
00:44:59.071 --> 00:45:02.449
in tragic circumstances
all the time.

979
00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.785
That's what I'm
trying to prevent.

980
00:45:08.247 --> 00:45:10.040
-Rob!
-Susan!

981
00:45:10.082 --> 00:45:11.959
What's your
official title now?

982
00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:14.837
I'm a professor. so. um.

983
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.255
they call me Professor Lee.

984
00:45:16.338 --> 00:45:19.258
I just go by Rob most days.

985
00:45:19.299 --> 00:45:21.468
It is my distinct privilege

986
00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:24.471
to introduce to you Susan Bro.

987
00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:27.433
When I met Susan.
she came up to me.

988
00:45:27.474 --> 00:45:30.018
gave me this huge hug

989
00:45:30.102 --> 00:45:32.271
that I didn't deserve.

990
00:45:32.312 --> 00:45:33.814
and I apologized to her

991
00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:38.485
because my ancestry has been
filled with hate and racism.

992
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:41.029
The statue of my ancestor
was the reason

993
00:45:41.113 --> 00:45:44.575
that many people were
marching on Charlottesville.

994
00:45:44.616 --> 00:45:46.201
Susan looked at me.
and she said.

995
00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:48.287
"Don't apologize.

996
00:45:48.328 --> 00:45:51.039
Do something about it."

997
00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:53.625
(applause)

998
00:45:54.835 --> 00:45:55.919
Thank you. good morning.

999
00:45:55.961 --> 00:45:58.046
On August 12th. I joined a club

1000
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:59.965
that no mother
ever wants to join

1001
00:46:00.048 --> 00:46:02.050
where you have a child

1002
00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:04.303
who is removed from your life.

1003
00:46:04.344 --> 00:46:06.680
She was just 32 years old.

1004
00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:08.307
finding her voice.

1005
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:09.725
She showed up.

1006
00:46:09.808 --> 00:46:12.269
You say. "Okay.
that happened a year ago.

1007
00:46:12.311 --> 00:46:13.979
What does that have
to do with anything?"

1008
00:46:14.021 --> 00:46:16.482
Well. here's what I would like
you to take away from this.

1009
00:46:16.523 --> 00:46:19.485
There is a great divide
in our country.

1010
00:46:19.568 --> 00:46:22.112
and I think it's
probably a good thing.

1011
00:46:22.154 --> 00:46:24.364
We're finally looking at issues

1012
00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:26.158
that we have glossed over.

1013
00:46:26.241 --> 00:46:27.826
What I hear from people of color

1014
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:31.163
is white people annoy
the heck out of 'em

1015
00:46:31.205 --> 00:46:33.499
when they say.
"I don't see color.

1016
00:46:33.582 --> 00:46:35.709
Race isn't important to me.

1017
00:46:35.793 --> 00:46:37.294
All lives matter."

1018
00:46:37.336 --> 00:46:39.296
because how it
sounds to them is

1019
00:46:39.338 --> 00:46:41.965
"I have to see you
as another white person

1020
00:46:42.007 --> 00:46:43.509
in order to accept you."

1021
00:46:43.592 --> 00:46:45.677
I used to say those same things.

1022
00:46:45.761 --> 00:46:47.888
What they would
like us to say is.

1023
00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:50.599
"I see your color.
I see your heritage.

1024
00:46:50.682 --> 00:46:53.852
I recognize them.
I celebrate them with you."

1025
00:46:53.936 --> 00:46:55.938
And therein lies the difference.

1026
00:46:56.021 --> 00:46:57.564
Be willing to understand

1027
00:46:57.648 --> 00:47:02.528
we as white people have had
a free ride in a lot of ways.

1028
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:06.114
even if we've struggled
from poverty all the way up.

1029
00:47:06.198 --> 00:47:07.783
We still have
layers of protection

1030
00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:10.869
that other people
don't necessarily have.

1031
00:47:10.953 --> 00:47:12.162
So we have to rethink

1032
00:47:12.204 --> 00:47:14.373
a lot of the structures
of our country.

1033
00:47:14.414 --> 00:47:15.666
Simply glossing over.

1034
00:47:15.707 --> 00:47:17.334
and everybody
hugging each other

1035
00:47:17.376 --> 00:47:20.712
and singing Kumbaya
is not gonna solve anything.

1036
00:47:20.796 --> 00:47:23.757
We have some serious
issues to work on.

1037

♪

1038
00:47:26.426 --> 00:47:28.887
I just hope everybody
stays calm in court

1039
00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:30.681
because I've seen
how the evidence

1040
00:47:30.722 --> 00:47:33.225
has triggered people
in the past.

Heather's death.

1044
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:42.776
nor many major hate crimes.

1045
00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.864
are not counted as hate crimes
in the FBI statistics.

1046
00:47:46.905 --> 00:47:50.492
but we've gotta change
the way we report hate crimes.

1047

In your own words.
can you just kind of

1048
00:47:55.122 --> 00:47:56.665
go over your platform points?

1049
00:47:56.748 --> 00:47:58.917
You know. Kansas is
at the geographic center

1050
00:47:59.001 --> 00:48:00.043
of the United States.

1051
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:05.591
Does it discourage you at all
that you've been trailing behind

1052
00:48:05.674 --> 00:48:07.342
-your opponents?
-I'm still confident

1053
00:48:07.426 --> 00:48:08.844
we can win this race.

1054
00:48:08.927 --> 00:48:09.928
All eyes are on Kansas

for anyone to predict.

I was proud that he'd go
as an independent.

1058

than just being an R or a D.

1062
00:48:25.444 --> 00:48:27.613
Both sides play the same games.

1063
00:48:27.696 --> 00:48:30.866
It does not a damn thing
for the country.

1064
00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:36.538
I would like to ask you
where you stand on the LGBTQ?

1065
00:48:36.622 --> 00:48:38.624
I've got a brother who's gay.
I understand that.

1066
00:48:38.707 --> 00:48:40.959
I wouldn't wanna create
an environment

1067
00:48:41.043 --> 00:48:42.628
where he felt like
he couldn't build

1068
00:48:42.669 --> 00:48:45.047
a full and complete
life in Kansas.

1069
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:46.673
Thank you.

1070
00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:49.384

1071
00:48:49.468 --> 00:48:51.386
A poll taken in August
shows Laura Kelly

1072
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:53.555
ahead one point of Kris Kobach.

1073
00:48:53.639 --> 00:48:56.391
and Greg Orman with
12 percent of votes.

1074
00:48:56.475 --> 00:48:58.727
The candidates are vying
for every last vote.

1075
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.437
You feel re-energized
out of it?

1076
00:49:00.479 --> 00:49:02.022
You know. I think as
we travel the state.

1077
00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:04.733
it's very clear to me
that we're pulling votes

1078
00:49:04.816 --> 00:49:06.818
from across
the political spectrum.

1079
00:49:06.902 --> 00:49:11.782
Welcome the next governor
of the state of Kansas.

1080
00:49:11.823 --> 00:49:13.825
Greg Orman!

1081
00:49:13.867 --> 00:49:16.119

1082
00:49:16.161 --> 00:49:18.580
Thank you very much.

1083
00:49:18.664 --> 00:49:21.917
I'm actually gonna
open it up to questions.

1084
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.461
Some of the recent polls
don't give you

1085
00:49:24.503 --> 00:49:27.255
very high percentage
of the polling vote.

1086
00:49:27.339 --> 00:49:28.966
There's no question
we're behind.

1087
00:49:29.007 --> 00:49:32.386
but I also very much believe
we can win this race.

1088
00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:33.845
It's a little hard
for me to think

1089
00:49:33.929 --> 00:49:37.557
that you're gonna move
that many percent

1090
00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:40.894
in a little over a month.

1091
00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:42.104
The biggest single issue

1092
00:49:42.187 --> 00:49:43.897
facing an independent candidate

1093
00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:46.817
is psychological.

1094
00:49:46.858 --> 00:49:51.488
People tend to make decisions
now more based out of fear

1095
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:55.534
than on what we
can become as a country.

1096
00:49:55.617 --> 00:49:57.661
But when fear dominates.

1097
00:49:57.703 --> 00:50:00.038
it's hard to break through.

and 40 percent of Americans

1100
00:50:06.211 --> 00:50:07.587

1101
00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:10.257
They're saying. "Hey.
I'm a combination of things.

1102
00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.134
I wanna vote
for people I trust."

1103
00:50:12.217 --> 00:50:14.553
Where are all those independents
in our state legislatures.

1104
00:50:14.594 --> 00:50:16.179
in the House of Representatives
and Senate?

1105
00:50:16.221 --> 00:50:17.806
There are very few independents

1106
00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:20.392
because we have now two parties

1107
00:50:20.475 --> 00:50:21.852
that control institutions.

1108
00:50:21.893 --> 00:50:24.855
which parties were
never meant to control.

1109
00:50:24.896 --> 00:50:27.441
We've gotta return
the institutions

1110
00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:29.276
that determine our lives
to the people.

1111
00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:30.652
not to the parties.

-Hi. how's everyone?
-Good!

1113

anyone would want

1114
00:50:34.531 --> 00:50:36.742
to work in politics. honestly.

1115
00:50:36.825 --> 00:50:39.327
He wants to be
a public servant.

1116
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:40.370
We're just getting going here.

His passion is
to change the way

1120
00:50:52.758 --> 00:50:54.426

1121
00:50:54.509 --> 00:50:55.844
-Hi. Scott. how are you?
-Yes. sir.

1122
00:50:55.927 --> 00:50:58.013
I wanted to know your stance
on the second amendment.

1123
00:50:58.096 --> 00:51:00.932
Just succinctly.
I am a gun owner.

1124
00:51:00.974 --> 00:51:03.935
but I also believe we can
honor the second amendment

1125
00:51:04.019 --> 00:51:06.104
and have reasonable
firearm safety laws.

comes out feeling whole.

Fine. Mr. Orman.

meet for coffee every morning.

1134

We just know you're
gonna be the next man.

1135

to see you in there.

why you don't

"You know what. let's do this"?

The brokenness that
we saw in our country

in this last
presidential election.

1158
00:52:23.849 --> 00:52:27.352
We saw Americans really
wanting to destroy one another.

1159

having political disagreements.

I had been part of what had
caused that in the past.

an opportunity

to do something in
the opposite side of that.

1163

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:31.242
in this country

1410
01:04:31.325 --> 01:04:34.245
we've never been forced
to deal with the things

1411
01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:36.247
that have caused

1412
01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:37.874
to where we are today.

1413
01:04:37.915 --> 01:04:39.166
And so to heal them.

1414
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:41.711
we have to go pretty far back.

1415
01:04:41.752 --> 01:04:44.589
Did you ever meet anybody
that didn't wanna talk to you?

1416
01:04:44.672 --> 01:04:48.217
So we're in Savannah. Georgia
kinda early on in our trip.

1417
01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:50.761
and I'm reaching out to this guy

1418
01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:53.931
who's a real kind of
community leader in Savannah.

1419
01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:55.933
-African American gentleman.
-African American guy.

1420
01:04:55.975 --> 01:04:57.768
he's 85 years old.

1421
01:04:57.852 --> 01:04:59.395
He's lived in Georgia
his whole life.

1422
01:04:59.437 --> 01:05:03.024
so he's seen lots
in his days in Georgia.

1423
01:05:03.107 --> 01:05:05.109
And he goes. "David.

1424
01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:07.069
you know. even if
I had time to meet with you.

1425
01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:09.447
-I don't think I would."
-Oh. okay.

1426
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:11.949
-I was like. "Okay. all right."
-Did he give a reason?

1427
01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:14.410
He goes. "It's hard
to be reconciled

1428
01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:17.038
with someone who has
a boot on your neck."

1429
01:05:17.121 --> 01:05:18.873
-Wow.
-That is not

1430
01:05:18.956 --> 01:05:21.500
the America that
I believed that I lived in.

1431
01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:25.796
He saw me as
a white guy outsider

1432
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.591
walking up to him
standing over here

1433
01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:30.134
where he's got
a boot on his neck.

1434
01:05:30.217 --> 01:05:32.553
And for me to
come up to him and say.

1435
01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:35.139
"Hey. can't we all
just get along?"

1436
01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:38.976
But before we do that.
we've gotta deal with the boot.

1437
01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:43.314
I had to realize
that he associated me

1438
01:05:43.397 --> 01:05:47.026
with the man
standing on top of him.

1439
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:50.154
So has it changed how you vote?

1440
01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:52.949
Or whether you vote at all?

1441
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:55.993
Um. I think it will
change the way I vote.

1442
01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:59.580
but I don't think
I'm Democrat now.

1443
01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:01.540
I'm not drawn to either party.

1444
01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.542
I think they're both
part of the problem.

1445
01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.586
So. I voted for Donald Trump

1446
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:07.546
in the last
presidential election.

1447
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.508
I wasn't wild about
either candidate.

1448
01:06:10.591 --> 01:06:11.592
but I will never vote

1449
01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:16.389
I'll vote for a human being

1450
01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:17.932
who I resonate with.

1451
01:06:18.015 --> 01:06:21.894
Where are you gonna
take the RV and go next?

1452
01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:26.983
We're gonna drive the RV
from Dallas

1453

1454
01:06:28.275 --> 01:06:32.238
Okay. And why Charlottesville?

1455
01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:34.907
I don't know is
probably my best answer.

It is so nice
to speak with you both.

1760
01:19:30.807 --> 01:19:34.811
Our time together
has shaped our lives.

1761
01:19:34.895 --> 01:19:38.190
Well. I felt honored
to meet both of you as well.

1762
01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:40.275
Because you were
so genuine and open.

1763
01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:43.278
I felt that I
could be vulnerable.

1764
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.613
You opened our eyes.

1765
01:19:44.654 --> 01:19:47.741
and I just--I cannot tell you

1766
01:19:47.824 --> 01:19:48.992
how thankful I am.

1767
01:19:49.034 --> 01:19:51.745
It has stuck with me so because

1768
01:19:51.828 --> 01:19:54.331
it was the first time
that I had shared

1769
01:19:54.414 --> 01:19:57.459
my experiences
with a white person.

1770
01:19:57.501 --> 01:20:00.003
It's not a story that
I've shared often with anyone.

1771
01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:04.508
I think that that was just
the time that God had ordained

1772
01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:06.343
'cause it was healing for me.

1773
01:20:06.384 --> 01:20:09.012
It made me aware of how

1774
01:20:09.095 --> 01:20:11.181
I had pushed it to the side.

1775
01:20:11.264 --> 01:20:13.266
♪

1776
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:16.436
You have helped us heal

1777
01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.147
from racism in our own hearts.

1778
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:20.857
Reconciliation is possible

1779
01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:23.193
when you have people
being open enough

1780
01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:26.154
to have really honest dialogue.

1781
01:20:26.196 --> 01:20:27.405
I just want you to know that

1782
01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:30.617
we love you. we truly love you

1783
01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:32.244
in the depths of our heart.

1784
01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:36.039
Thank you. love you too.

1785
01:20:36.122 --> 01:20:40.836
There's no one magic
solution to fix democracy.

1786
01:20:40.877 --> 01:20:42.379
We've gotta do it
at the grassroots level.

1787
01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:44.506
in legislatures.
in town councils.

1788
01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:47.050
in the school systems.

1789
01:20:47.133 --> 01:20:49.052
We have to be reuniting
all the time.

1790
01:20:49.135 --> 01:20:53.306
every day in our lives.

1791
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:54.641
Don't be afraid

1792
01:20:54.724 --> 01:20:58.270
of difficult conversations.

1793
01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:00.689
Don't be afraid
to reach out to someone

1794
01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:05.569
who might not believe
exactly like you believe.

1795
01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:09.197
And this I actually
learned from my daughter.

1796
01:21:09.239 --> 01:21:11.032
take a minute and say.

1797
01:21:11.074 --> 01:21:14.286
"Can you talk to me?"

1798
01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:15.745
We have to start
thinking of people

1799
01:21:15.829 --> 01:21:17.163
different than ourselves

1800
01:21:17.247 --> 01:21:18.957
as potential allies.

1801
01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.167
and as part of the solution.

1802
01:21:21.251 --> 01:21:23.420
Being a bridge builder
isn't about

1803
01:21:23.503 --> 01:21:24.796
compromising your beliefs.

1804
01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.048
It's about standing up
for your beliefs.

1805
01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:29.426
but respecting your adversary

1806
01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:32.095
when they do
exactly the same thing.

1807
01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:33.471
The divisions run a lot deeper

1808
01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.348
than we ever
could have imagined.

1809
01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:38.643
but so does the depth of love

1810
01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.812
that we've seen in people.

1811
01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:43.356
Meeting people
across the country

1812
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.235
who have a passion
to bridge divides.

1813
01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:50.155
that gives me hope.

1814
01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:52.949
As citizens. we like to say.
"I have rights as a citizen."

1815
01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:54.242
We do have rights.

1816
01:21:54.284 --> 01:21:56.328
but we also have
responsibilities.

1817
01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:58.288
and that's working
through our differences

1818
01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.415
when our rights clash.

1819
01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:03.919
I want people to
declare their independence.

1820
01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.587
Tell elected officials

1821
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:09.049
"You no longer can take
my vote for granted.

1822
01:22:09.132 --> 01:22:12.928
You gotta earn it
by solving problems."

1823
01:22:12.969 --> 01:22:15.722
There are already millions
and millions of Americans

1824
01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:18.016
crossing the divide every day.

1825
01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:22.479
That's why our country
hangs together.

1826

Our country is resilient.

1827
01:22:24.522 --> 01:22:28.026
but we can't take
democracy for granted.

1828
01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:31.821
The genius of America is that
it's our responsibility

1829
01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:34.366
to fix it.

1830

The Listen First Movement

distance themselves

from that problem

1864
01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:07.500
I think the truth is
that we're all a part of this.

1865
01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:08.460
but it's also good news

1866
01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:13.590
A lot of spaces where
we are divided

1867
01:24:13.673 --> 01:24:16.051
is rooted in fear.

1868
01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:19.262
Simply put.
we can choose courage.

1869
01:24:19.345 --> 01:24:21.514
There is a huge desire

1870
01:24:21.598 --> 01:24:24.392

We all want the same thing.
