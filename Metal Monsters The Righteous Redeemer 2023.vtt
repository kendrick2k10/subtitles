that it's built 100% here.

133
00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:37.485
And it starts with Ryan. with
a design that's impeccable.

134
00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.362
- So we got our main rails.

135

these tie-ins.

136
00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:43.491
Shocks will go there.

and wheels are going to mount.

139

Here. suspension system.

142
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.253

this body on here.

143
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.629
We got to make
all of our mounts.

144

As you guys know.

152
00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:12.687
the Gemstones
want something wild.

153

premier race truck

be building for them.

155
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.568
but it's also going to
be a freestyle truck.

156
00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.111
So it's got to do crazy stuff.

157
00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.156
This is it
with all the components on it.

158
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.575
but then we also got to get
this blower motor in here.

159
00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.619
And on this build.
I want to lower the engine.

160
00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:28.870
I want to make this thing

161
00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.372
so if they want us to go
into a crazy corner.

162
00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:31.831
it's not going
to want to roll over.

163
00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:33.667
'cause for the stunts. they
want to do a lot of drifting

164
00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:35.752
and a lot of just blowing
through stuff.

165
00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.587
You don't want to be flipping
it over. tearing up that body.

- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.553
- The reason we're placing this
engine so low in this truck

170
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.305
is to make it so it doesn't
flip over so easy.

171
00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:49.140
It's gonna make it
easier and safer

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:51.101

these Gemstones stunts off.
