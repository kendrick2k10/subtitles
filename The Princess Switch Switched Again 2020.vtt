11
00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:56.000
<i>Cutest couple ever. right?</i>

12

15
00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:08.166

<i>-But I'm worried about Margaret.</i>
<i>-Why?</i>

57
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.041

<i>[Edward]</i>
<i>"Is the Duchess ready to rule?"</i>

59
00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:03.541
<i>And this?</i>

60
00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:07.541
<i>Margaret never expected to be queen.</i>

61
00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:10.500
<i>Remember how much she hated the spotlight?</i>

62
00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:13.708
<i>Well. with her coronation</i>
<i>televised on Christmas Day.</i>

63
00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:15.916
<i>she's going to have to</i>
<i>get used to it pretty quickly.</i>

64
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.833
<i>[chuckles]</i>

65
00:04:17.708 --> 00:04:20.166
<i>She just sounded so sad when I called her.</i>

66
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.166
<i>King Dennis died</i>

67
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.291
<i>-and Prince Howard abdicated so…</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

68
00:04:23.875 --> 00:04:26.458
<i>…like it or not. she's next</i>
<i>in the line of succession.</i>

69
00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.375
<i>Remind me. why are we talking</i>
<i>about Margaret again right now?</i>

70
00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:33.583
<i>Because I can't sleep when I'm worried.</i>

71
00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:35.375
<i>Well. there are…</i>

72
00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:40.125
<i>other things we might do</i>
<i>to relieve your anxiety</i>

73
00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:42.000
<i>besides talking about Lady Margaret.</i>

74
00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:44.333
<i>To tell you the truth.</i>
<i>I think she's not over Kevin.</i>

75
00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:48.083
<i>I mean. the breakup must have been</i>
<i>incredibly hard for both of them.</i>

76
00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:50.916
<i>-We could light a fire.</i>
<i>-She was about to move to Chicago.</i>

77
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.458
<i>-We could open a bottle of wine?</i>
<i>-They were almost engaged.</i>

78
00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:54.875
<i>We could put on some music.</i>

79
00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.583
<i>Did you know Kevin</i>
<i>was shopping for a ring?</i>

80
00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:58.000
<i>-Stacy!</i>
<i>-What?</i>

81
00:04:58.083 --> 00:05:01.666
<i>They went their separate ways.</i>
<i>People do it all the time.</i>

82
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.375
<i>I know. It's just…</i>

83
00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:06.541
<i>Olivia texts me every single day.</i>

84
00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:09.208
<i>She says that her dad's</i>
<i>miserable without Margaret.</i>

85
00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:12.541
<i>He turned down the invitation</i>
<i>to the coronation.</i>

86
00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:16.291
<i>-Apparently. he doesn't want to see her.</i>
<i>-Well. men never know what they want.</i>

87
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.125
<i>I know what I want.</i>

88
00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.541
<i>I have a great idea.</i>

89
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:26.458
<i>Why don't we take a teeny tiny</i>
<i>little detour to Chicago</i>

90
00:05:26.541 --> 00:05:27.916
<i>on our way to Montenaro?</i>

91
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.791
<i>Oh. darling. I wish I could</i>
<i>get away sooner. I really do.</i>

92
00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:34.750
<i>But… Unless you want to go</i>
<i>to Chicago without me…</i>

93
00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:37.000
<i>[both laugh]</i>

<i>comfortable.</i>

113
00:06:29.416 --> 00:06:30.541
<i>Yeah. it's all good.</i>

114
00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:34.750
<i>He hasn't gone on a date since</i>

115
00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:37.750
<i>I have a business to run. Remember?</i>

116
00:06:37.833 --> 00:06:40.250
<i>[Stacy] Come on. Kev.</i>
<i>Life isn't about working all the time.</i>

117
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:44.166
<i>I know. which is why we're adopting</i>
<i>another cat for Christmas.</i>

118
00:06:44.791 --> 00:06:45.875
<i>Another cat?</i>

119
00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.916
<i>Yeah. You can never have too many cats.</i>

120
00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:50.125
<i>We need to talk.</i>

121
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.708

00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:09.208
<i>And?</i>

126
00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:15.000
<i>Two years ago. you handed me</i>
<i>an invitation that changed my life.</i>

127
00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:16.958
<i>It's time for me to return the favor.</i>

128
00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:26.958
<i>Stace. Margaret and I</i>
<i>called it quits six months ago.</i>

129
00:07:27.041 --> 00:07:30.625
<i>Yeah. which is probably the dumbest thing</i>
<i>you've ever done in your life.</i>

130
00:07:30.708 --> 00:07:33.166
<i>We just didn't want</i>
<i>the same things anymore.</i>

131
00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:36.958
<i>Besides. I mean. she's moved on.</i>
<i>I've moved on.</i>

132

<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

133
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.916

<i>[clears throat] About that RSVP…</i>

136
00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:51.458

<i>Hey! Call the cat sitter.</i>

146
00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:24.708
<i>Maybe before we leave. you should get.</i>
<i>like. a haircut and a real pair of pants.</i>

147
00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:26.125
<i>What's wrong with these?</i>

148
00:08:56.166 --> 00:08:57.458
<i>Thank you. Frank.</i>

<i>-Oh. nonsense.</i>
<i>-There's no way we'd miss your coronation.</i>

155

336
00:18:18.708 --> 00:18:20.375

<i>Fiona's always been a free spirit.</i>

439
00:24:24.208 --> 00:24:26.666
<i>She inherited quite the fortune</i>
<i>when my uncle died.</i>

440

<i>Guessing there isn't much of it left.</i>

441

<i>[Margaret] There isn't.</i>

442

<i>-And your point is?</i>

<i>If you're tired. Mindy.</i>
<i>then come up with something better.</i>

466
00:25:52.291 --> 00:25:55.000
<i>I can't be the looks</i>
<i>and brains of this operation.</i>

<i>I thought I was the looks!</i>

468
00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.416
<i>And that's why you're not the brains.</i>

469
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:02.291
<i>Why can't you be the one who gets to be</i>
<i>queen instead of your stupid cousin?</i>

470
00:26:02.375 --> 00:26:03.625
<i>Then we'd be set for life.</i>

471
00:26:03.708 --> 00:26:05.291
<i>Just stop talking.</i>

472
00:26:06.083 --> 00:26:06.916

00:27:21.125 --> 00:27:22.416
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

496
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.166
<i>Hey. Do what you have to.</i>

497
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.583
<i>I thought there was something urgent.</i>

498
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.833
<i>There is. but it's not what you think.</i>

499
00:27:51.375 --> 00:27:53.458
<i>I knew if I didn't do this now.</i>
<i>I'd lose my nerve.</i>

500
00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:58.458
<i>What's this all about?</i>

501
00:27:58.916 --> 00:28:00.916
<i>Margaret. I'd be lying…</i>

502
00:28:01.791 --> 00:28:05.166
<i>if I told you I served you</i>
<i>only out of a sense of duty.</i>

503
00:28:06.791 --> 00:28:10.291
<i>You're not just about to become</i>
<i>the Queen of Montenaro.</i>

504
00:28:11.958 --> 00:28:14.125
<i>you've also become</i>
<i>the queen of my heart.</i>

505
00:28:15.291 --> 00:28:16.125
<i>Tony.</i>

506
00:28:16.875 --> 00:28:17.708
<i>This is for you.</i>

507
00:28:19.416 --> 00:28:21.125
<i>I was going to give it</i>
<i>to you at Christmas.</i>

508
00:28:21.208 --> 00:28:23.583
<i>but… I want you to have it now.</i>

509
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.666
<i>Oh.</i>

510
00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:30.375
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

511
00:28:33.333 --> 00:28:37.125
<i>We've been friends</i>
<i>for a long time now. you and I…</i>

512
00:28:38.541 --> 00:28:42.041
<i>but lately I've been wishing</i>
<i>we could be something more.</i>

513
00:28:45.583 --> 00:28:47.000
<i>Oh. I. uh...</i>

514
00:28:48.583 --> 00:28:51.000
<i>I really don't know what to think.</i>

515
00:28:52.541 --> 00:28:54.750
<i>I'm rather confused about everything.</i>

516
00:28:57.125 --> 00:28:58.000
<i>Does…</i>

517
00:28:58.541 --> 00:29:01.583
<i>everything include that friend of yours?</i>

518
00:29:02.333 --> 00:29:03.333
<i>I don't know.</i>

519
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.125
<i>Maybe…</i>

520
00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:08.125
<i>Margaret…</i>

521
00:29:09.916 --> 00:29:11.125
<i>it's all right.</i>

522
00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:14.333
<i>It's such a relief to hear you say that.</i>

523
00:29:14.916 --> 00:29:19.291
<i>You know. we'd make a fantastic couple.</i>
<i>you and I.</i>

524
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.708
<i>-Everyone says so.</i>
<i>-[laughs]</i>

525
00:29:23.958 --> 00:29:26.083
<i>Just promise me…</i>

526
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:28.208
<i>you'll at least consider it.</i>

527
00:29:31.541 --> 00:29:32.375
<i>All right.</i>

528
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.416
<i>What was I supposed to say?</i>

529
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.500
<i>I thought you and Antonio</i>
<i>weren't a thing.</i>

530
00:29:39.583 --> 00:29:40.541
<i>We're not.</i>

531
00:29:41.333 --> 00:29:43.625
<i>but Tony's been a huge help to me.</i>

532
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:46.375
<i>Don't you think</i>
<i>he's trying just a little too hard?</i>

533
00:29:46.458 --> 00:29:47.291
<i>[laughs]</i>

534
00:29:47.791 --> 00:29:50.875
<i>Tony's always spent a bit</i>
<i>too much on things he shouldn't.</i>

535
00:29:50.958 --> 00:29:52.750
<i>but we've known each other</i>
<i>since university.</i>

536
00:29:54.375 --> 00:29:56.125
<i>But maybe he's right.</i>

537
00:29:56.708 --> 00:29:58.458
<i>Maybe we could be good for each other.</i>

538
00:29:59.041 --> 00:30:01.166
<i>You and Kevin are good for each other.</i>

539
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.125
<i>There's so much water</i>
<i>under the bridge. Stacy.</i>

540
00:30:04.958 --> 00:30:08.375
<i>Kevin and I haven't even begun to talk</i>
<i>about what went wrong between us.</i>

541
00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:12.333
<i>and every time we try. we never get</i>
<i>a chance to finish our conversation.</i>

542
00:30:13.125 --> 00:30:14.625
<i>I don't know if we ever will.</i>

543
00:30:15.125 --> 00:30:16.750
<i>Well. maybe you need to try harder.</i>

544
00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:20.541
<i>Is love really supposed</i>
<i>to take so much effort?</i>

545
00:30:21.166 --> 00:30:24.458
<i>Look. I know it in my heart.</i>

546
00:30:24.541 --> 00:30:26.791
<i>You and Kevin are meant to be.</i>

547
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.250
<i>And I used to know it too.</i>

548
00:30:30.125 --> 00:30:32.583
<i>but maybe all we're meant to be</i>
<i>is a happy memory.</i>

549
00:30:42.458 --> 00:30:44.500
<i>I got your message. You wanted to see me?</i>

550
00:30:45.666 --> 00:30:46.666
<i>I did.</i>

551
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:47.875
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

552
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:52.750
<i>-What's up?</i>
<i>-This is terribly hard to say.</i>

553
00:30:53.791 --> 00:30:54.958
<i>but here it is.</i>

554
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:59.000
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>you're being fair to Lady Margaret.</i>

555
00:31:00.041 --> 00:31:01.166
<i>You want to explain that?</i>

556
00:31:01.958 --> 00:31:06.000
<i>I know the two of you</i>
<i>were involved for a time and…</i>

557
00:31:06.958 --> 00:31:10.125
<i>I can tell the relationship</i>
<i>was very meaningful.</i>

558
00:31:10.791 --> 00:31:11.791
<i>But. uh…</i>

559
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.833
<i>But what?</i>

560
00:31:15.458 --> 00:31:17.541
<i>Could it be that you're holding her back?</i>

561
00:31:20.541 --> 00:31:23.000
<i>If that's the way she felt. she'd tell me.</i>

562
00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:24.500
<i>Yeah. uh...</i>

563
00:31:26.041 --> 00:31:28.541
<i>Lady Margaret's very confused right now.</i>

564
00:31:29.541 --> 00:31:32.833
<i>I'm certain she doesn't want</i>
<i>to hurt your feelings. but. uh…</i>

565
00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:35.958
<i>have you really considered</i>
<i>what's best for her?</i>

566
00:31:38.041 --> 00:31:41.041
<i>Let me guess. you're what's best for her?</i>

567
00:31:42.041 --> 00:31:46.083
<i>Look. I know you care deeply for her.</i>
<i>Mr. Richards. but…</i>

568
00:31:46.166 --> 00:31:49.125
<i>when affairs of state overwhelm her.</i>

569
00:31:49.208 --> 00:31:52.791
<i>are you really sure</i>
<i>you're the one she should turn to?</i>

570
00:31:53.875 --> 00:31:56.041
<i>You're a baker from Chicago.</i>

571
00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:58.500
<i>and I'm certain a very good one.</i>

572
00:31:59.333 --> 00:32:03.958
<i>but… are you truly</i>
<i>a consort for a queen?</i>

573
00:32:09.625 --> 00:32:10.458
<i>[knocking]</i>

574
00:32:10.541 --> 00:32:11.416
<i>[Stacy] </i>Come in.

575
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:14.333
<i>Hey. what's up. kiddo?</i>

576
00:32:14.916 --> 00:32:15.958
<i>[Olivia] We gotta talk.</i>

577
00:32:16.041 --> 00:32:17.208
<i>Now!</i>

578
00:32:20.583 --> 00:32:21.708
<i>About what?</i>

579
00:32:21.791 --> 00:32:26.250
<i>Operation "Get Dad Back Together With</i>
<i>Margaret." it's going to crash and burn.</i>

580
00:32:26.375 --> 00:32:27.708
<i>Yeah. tell me about it.</i>

581
00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:30.000
<i>But I have an idea.</i>

582
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.041
<i>You want us to do what?</i>

583
00:32:34.125 --> 00:32:35.500
<i>Switch places again.</i>

584
00:32:36.125 --> 00:32:39.250
<i>You said you needed more time</i>
<i>to talk things over with Kevin.</i>

585
00:32:39.333 --> 00:32:41.916
<i>but you can't do that</i>
<i>because you're too busy.</i>

586
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.375
<i>So Stacy can be you.</i>

587
00:32:44.458 --> 00:32:47.291
<i>and you and my dad</i>
<i>can spend some quality time together.</i>

588
00:32:47.375 --> 00:32:49.166
<i>It's terribly risky.</i>

589
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.708
<i>It was risky the last time</i>
<i>and you're the one who thought of it.</i>

590
00:32:52.791 --> 00:32:56.458
<i>Yes. but you're a princess now</i>
<i>and I'm about to become queen.</i>

591
00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.958
<i>We can't just stop everything</i>
<i>and swap lives.</i>

592
00:33:00.041 --> 00:33:01.041
<i>Why not?</i>

593
00:33:01.916 --> 00:33:03.875
<i>With everything</i>
<i>that's going on with Tony--</i>

594
00:33:03.958 --> 00:33:04.958
<i>[Stacy] Margaret…</i>

595
00:33:06.125 --> 00:33:08.708
<i>If you know for sure</i>
<i>that it's over with Kevin</i>

596
00:33:08.791 --> 00:33:11.041
<i>and you want to get serious with Antonio.</i>

597
00:33:11.125 --> 00:33:13.541
<i>we won't say another word about this.</i>

598
00:33:14.458 --> 00:33:16.375
<i>Do you really think we could pull it off?</i>

599
00:33:16.958 --> 00:33:17.833
<i>Again?</i>

600
00:33:18.708 --> 00:33:21.833
<i>Well. the only thing on your schedule</i>
<i>tomorrow is the Christmas concert.</i>

601
00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:24.583
<i>All you have to do</i>
<i>is sit and wave to people.</i>

602
00:33:24.666 --> 00:33:27.166
<i>Yeah. and when it's over Mrs. Donatelli</i>
<i>will walk you--</i>

603
00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:31.000
<i>I mean. me. through the reception</i>
<i>and then it's back to the palace.</i>

604
00:33:31.083 --> 00:33:34.625
<i>That way. you and Kevin have</i>
<i>plenty of alone time together.</i>

605
00:33:34.708 --> 00:33:36.416
<i>And then we switch back.</i>

606
00:33:38.625 --> 00:33:40.375
<i>I suppose it could work.</i>

607
00:33:41.291 --> 00:33:42.541
<i>Does that mean you'll do it?</i>

608
00:33:44.333 --> 00:33:46.416
<i>Did you talk this over with Kevin?</i>

609
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:47.833
<i>[laughs]</i>

610
00:33:48.333 --> 00:33:50.500
<i>Did you talk this over with Margaret?</i>

611
00:33:50.583 --> 00:33:53.125
<i>Yeah. and she's good to go if you are.</i>

612
00:33:53.875 --> 00:33:55.458
<i>[sighs] I don't know.</i>

613
00:33:56.583 --> 00:33:58.625
<i>-Maybe she's better off with Antonio.</i>
<i>-[Stacy groans]</i>

614
00:33:59.958 --> 00:34:00.958
<i>He's a nice guy.</i>

615
00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:03.333
<i>-Yeah. well. you're a nicer guy.</i>
<i>-Yeah!</i>

616
00:34:05.208 --> 00:34:06.041
<i>[scoffs]</i>

617
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:09.541
<i>Did you tell Edward about this?</i>

618
00:34:09.625 --> 00:34:12.833
<i>The less people who know. the better.</i>

619
00:34:12.916 --> 00:34:15.000
<i>Yeah. I'll fake a cold or something.</i>

620
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.416
<i>Look. it'll only be for a few hours.</i>

621
00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.958
<i>Okay. and I'll tell him everything</i>
<i>as soon as it's over.</i>

622
00:34:23.458 --> 00:34:24.833
<i>You need to do this. Daddy.</i>

623
00:34:31.208 --> 00:34:32.416
<i>If Margaret's in…</i>

624
00:34:33.458 --> 00:34:34.333
<i>-I'm in.</i>
<i>-Yay!</i>

625
00:34:34.416 --> 00:34:35.583
<i>[squeals. grunts]</i>

626

<i>Oh. there you are. darling!</i>
<i>Been looking all over for you!</i>

628
00:34:46.708 --> 00:34:49.500
<i>Oh. well. you know me. Always busy!</i>

629
00:34:49.583 --> 00:34:52.791
<i>-Yes. That's what I wanted to talk about.</i>
<i>-Can we talk about it later?</i>

630
00:34:52.875 --> 00:34:57.125
<i>I was just on my way to the kitchen</i>
<i>to do some Christmas baking.</i>

631
00:34:57.208 --> 00:35:00.000
<i>Well. I was actually hoping</i>
<i>we might be able to find a moment</i>

632
00:35:00.083 --> 00:35:01.583
<i>to do something together.</i>

633
00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:04.875
<i>We will. I promise. As soon</i>
<i>as I'm done in the kitchen. okay?</i>

634
00:35:05.625 --> 00:35:07.208
<i>Why the change of clothes?</i>

635
00:35:09.166 --> 00:35:10.541
<i>Oh. what. these old things?</i>

636
00:35:11.333 --> 00:35:13.791
<i>I am donating them to the orphanage.</i>

637
00:35:13.875 --> 00:35:16.041
<i>I better get them to Frank.</i>
<i>He's coordinating everything.</i>

638
00:35:16.625 --> 00:35:18.541
<i>Didn't I get you that scarf</i>
<i>last Christmas?</i>

639
00:35:19.208 --> 00:35:24.375
<i>You did. I love it so much. I got</i>

829
00:45:01.083 --> 00:45:02.458

830
00:45:05.333 --> 00:45:07.125
<i>Well. to be completely candid…</i>

831
00:45:08.333 --> 00:45:12.958
<i>things have been… different</i>
<i>between us these past few months.</i>

832
00:45:14.125 --> 00:45:18.083
<i>It seems as if she's always got</i>
<i>something to do or somewhere to be.</i>

833
00:45:19.458 --> 00:45:21.916
<i>Well. I'm sure you're very busy as well.</i>

834
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.375
<i>Yeah. I suppose.</i>

835
00:45:24.916 --> 00:45:30.125
<i>But I daresay that most of what I do is to</i>
<i>keep busy while she's otherwise occupied.</i>

836
00:45:30.958 --> 00:45:34.250
<i>I'm honestly worried that somehow</i>
<i>I've let her down.</i>

837
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:38.291
<i>That perhaps married life</i>
<i>isn't what she hoped it would be.</i>

<i>That…</i>

840

<i>That couldn't be true.</i>

841
00:45:47.125 --> 00:45:48.666
<i>Has she said anything to you?</i>

842
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:52.083
<i>Anything that might make you think</i>
<i>she's having second thoughts about us?</i>

843
00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:53.375
<i>Not a peep.</i>

844
00:45:53.958 --> 00:45:56.500
<i>Because nothing is more important to me</i>
<i>than her happiness.</i>

<i>This isn't funny.</i>
<i>It's time to switch back.</i>

1087

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.166
<i>You must be joking.</i>

1089

<i>Because I think there is.</i>

1106
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:13.750
<i>I think there's a very big reason.</i>

1107
01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:17.000
<i>If your cousin's there.</i>
<i>then who've we got in the basement?</i>

1108
01:01:17.083 --> 01:01:19.625
<i>Well. the look-alike from Belgravia.</i>

1109
01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:23.166
<i>She did say you grabbed the wrong person.</i>

1110
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:24.708
<i>Me?</i>

1111
01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:27.666

<i>[grunts] We need a plan.</i>

1116
01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:37.500
<i>All right…</i>

1117

<i>You said this was a get-in.</i>
<i>get-out job. right?</i>

1118
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:42.833
<i>So?</i>

1119

1123

<i>Hello? You're going to be queen.</i>

<i>Why are you speaking</i>
<i>with a different accent?</i>

<i>Why won't anyone believe me?</i>

1139

<i>There's been a bit of a snag.</i>

1146
01:03:09.625 --> 01:03:12.583
<i>Well. a rather major snag to be precise.</i>

1147

01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:25.291
<i>No. I am most certainly not all right.</i>

1152
01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:27.500
<i>The most awful thing has happened.</i>

1153
01:03:27.583 --> 01:03:30.791
<i>After 25 years of loyal service.</i>
<i>Lady Margaret has…</i>

1154
01:03:32.125 --> 01:03:33.625
<i>Well. she's given me the boot.</i>

1155
01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:36.333
<i>She says that she doesn't need me anymore.</i>

1156
01:03:36.416 --> 01:03:38.708
<i>and she's moved the coronation</i>
<i>up to tonight</i>

1157
01:03:38.791 --> 01:03:41.000
<i>so that she can spend Christmas</i>
<i>with the orphans.</i>

1158
01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:44.041
<i>I would never fire you. Mrs. Donatelli.</i>

1159
01:03:44.125 --> 01:03:46.791
<i>and I certainly am not moving up</i>
<i>my coronation.</i>

1160
01:03:47.375 --> 01:03:48.208
<i>[gasps]</i>

1161
01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:50.458
<i>Lady Margaret?</i>

1162
01:03:51.625 --> 01:03:52.750
<i>Oh. [laughs]</i>

1163
01:03:53.416 --> 01:03:54.416
<i>[sighs] Oh.</i>

1164
01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:58.500
<i>-And… he knows?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1165
01:03:59.875 --> 01:04:01.791
<i>-And you've not switched back yet?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

1166
01:04:01.875 --> 01:04:05.583
<i>And I can assure you the woman upstairs</i>
<i>in my suite is not Princess Stacy.</i>

1167
01:04:05.666 --> 01:04:08.333
<i>unless she's gone</i>
<i>completely off her trolley.</i>

1168
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:11.583
<i>Let me see if I follow this. so…</i>

1169
01:04:12.375 --> 01:04:14.416
<i>if the two of you haven't switched back</i>

1170
01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:16.708
<i>and this is Lady Margaret.</i>

1171
01:04:17.458 --> 01:04:21.000
<i>and if Lady Margaret upstairs isn't Stacy.</i>

1172
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:24.500
<i>who's upstairs and where's my wife?</i>

1173
01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:26.958
<i>Off with their heads.</i>

1174
01:04:27.041 --> 01:04:28.666
<i>[laughs]</i>

1175
01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:30.375
<i>[knocking]</i>

1176
01:04:30.458 --> 01:04:31.291
<i>Who--</i>

1177
01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:34.291
<i>-Who is it?</i>
<i>-It's Kevin.</i>

1178
01:04:43.541 --> 01:04:44.375
<i>Come in.</i>

1179
01:04:47.791 --> 01:04:49.625
<i>I know. I'm kind of early but…</i>

1180
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.333
<i>Oh! I can come back later if--</i>

1181
01:04:52.416 --> 01:04:54.166
<i>No. Kevin. please stay.</i>

1182
01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:56.458
<i>There's something we need to discuss.</i>

1183
01:04:57.208 --> 01:04:58.416
<i>Yeah. Sure.</i>

1184
01:04:59.291 --> 01:05:00.125
<i>Everything okay?</i>

1185
01:05:00.708 --> 01:05:02.291
<i>I'm afraid it isn't.</i>

1186
01:05:03.083 --> 01:05:04.041
<i>[gasps]</i>

1187
01:05:05.541 --> 01:05:08.791
<i>The time we spent together today</i>
<i>was truly magical.</i>

1188
01:05:08.875 --> 01:05:10.291
<i>Yeah. I thought so too.</i>

1189
01:05:10.875 --> 01:05:12.333
<i>But it isn't right.</i>

1190
01:05:15.166 --> 01:05:17.708
<i>Deep down. we both know it.</i>

1191
01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:23.083
<i>You need a wife and your darling</i>
<i>little girl needs a mother.</i>

1192
01:05:23.958 --> 01:05:26.875
<i>Like it or not. I have a country to run.</i>

1193
01:05:28.333 --> 01:05:31.791
<i>And I can't be the wife</i>
<i>and mother you both deserve.</i>

1194
01:05:32.666 --> 01:05:33.500
<i>That's not true.</i>

1195
01:05:33.583 --> 01:05:35.666
<i>Don't make this harder than it is.</i>

1196
01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:39.750
<i>-But you said--</i>
<i>-You must forget what I said.</i>

1197
01:05:40.666 --> 01:05:43.041
<i>I was emotional. I wasn't thinking.</i>

1198
01:05:45.583 --> 01:05:47.083
<i>Margaret. this isn't like you.</i>

1199
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:50.083
<i>Please.</i>

1200
01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:53.416
<i>it's best for both of us</i>
<i>if we end this now.</i>

1201
01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:59.125
<i>You and Olivia need to go home.</i>

1202
01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:01.958
<i>You really mean that?</i>

1203
01:06:04.708 --> 01:06:05.833
<i>Because if you do.</i>

1204
01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:08.458
<i>I'm not coming back…</i>

1205
01:06:09.958 --> 01:06:10.791
<i>ever.</i>

1206
01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:13.375
<i>[sighs] Goodbye. Kevin.</i>

1207
01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:33.375
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1208
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:36.833
<i>Bye!</i>

1209
01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:45.833
<i>Hello?</i>

1210
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.208
<i>Hello. can anyone hear me?</i>

1211
01:06:51.125 --> 01:06:52.041
<i>Hello!</i>

1212
01:07:15.291 --> 01:07:18.000
<i>I still don't understand what happened.</i>

1213
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:22.833
<i>She changed her mind. That's all.</i>

1214
01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.791
<i>Are you sure she wasn't pranking you?</i>

1215
01:07:27.875 --> 01:07:28.750
<i>Liv…</i>

1216
01:07:30.375 --> 01:07:32.708
<i>I know how much</i>
<i>you care about Margaret.</i>

1217
01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:35.166
<i>but it's time to let go.</i>

1218
01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.500
<i>For both of us.</i>

1219
01:07:38.083 --> 01:07:39.916
<i>-But. Daddy--</i>
<i>-Livvie…</i>

1220
01:07:40.791 --> 01:07:41.708
<i>let's go.</i>

1221
01:07:43.041 --> 01:07:44.041
<i>Come on. </i>

1222
01:07:46.375 --> 01:07:47.416
<i>Get in the car.</i>

1223
01:07:57.333 --> 01:07:58.291
<i>Airport. please.</i>

1224
01:08:00.125 --> 01:08:01.041
<i>Very good. sir.</i>

1225
01:08:08.833 --> 01:08:10.708
<i>After the concert what happened?</i>

1226
01:08:10.791 --> 01:08:13.375
<i>We were separated for a few minutes</i>
<i>at the reception.</i>

1227
01:08:13.875 --> 01:08:16.708
<i>and then she returned</i>
<i>to the palace in her limousine.</i>

1228
01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:17.666
<i>Without you?</i>

1229
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:21.000
<i>I'd been informed that she'd already left.</i>
<i>So I took a separate car.</i>

1230
01:08:21.083 --> 01:08:24.541
<i>So something must have happened</i>
<i>after the concert and before you returned.</i>

1231
01:08:26.291 --> 01:08:27.125
<i>[gasps]</i>

1232
01:08:27.416 --> 01:08:29.958
<i>-The drink!</i>
<i>-Ah-ha! So you were drinking!</i>

1233
01:08:30.041 --> 01:08:32.250
<i>Not me. you fool.</i>

1234
01:08:32.916 --> 01:08:35.958
<i>The man with your cousin Fiona… Reggie.</i>

1235
01:08:36.041 --> 01:08:38.708
<i>-He spilled a drink on your dress.</i>
<i>-Stacy's dress.</i>

1236
01:08:38.791 --> 01:08:43.000
<i>Yes. and then Fiona's secretary</i>
<i>took her to the ladies' room.</i>

1237
01:08:43.083 --> 01:08:44.833
<i>-Ah-ha!</i>
<i>-What are you thinking. Frank?</i>

1238
01:08:45.416 --> 01:08:48.083
<i>I have absolutely no idea. sir.</i>

1239
01:08:48.833 --> 01:08:49.958
<i>I think I know.</i>

1240
01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:53.083
<i>They made the switch</i>
<i>in the powder room.</i>

1241
01:08:53.666 --> 01:08:56.083
<i>They kidnapped Stacy</i>
<i>because they thought it was me.</i>

1242
01:08:56.875 --> 01:09:00.125
<i>-So the woman upstairs is your cousin.</i>
<i>-I wouldn't put it past her.</i>

1243
01:09:00.208 --> 01:09:04.375
<i>And underneath all that peroxide.</i>
<i>there is a striking resemblance.</i>

1244
01:09:04.458 --> 01:09:06.708
<i>So if Fiona's associates took Stacy.</i>

1245
01:09:07.666 --> 01:09:08.958
<i>where would they go?</i>

1246
01:09:09.041 --> 01:09:11.541
<i>I'm guessing</i>
<i>they're at her father's old estate.</i>

1247
01:09:11.625 --> 01:09:13.500
<i>It's less than an hour away from here.</i>

1248
01:09:13.583 --> 01:09:16.125
<i>Right. I'll get the car.</i>

1249
01:09:16.208 --> 01:09:17.333
<i>I'll deal with Fiona.</i>

1250
01:09:17.416 --> 01:09:20.750
<i>Well. I wouldn't confront her just yet.</i>
<i>Not while they still have Stacy.</i>

1251
01:09:20.833 --> 01:09:23.083
<i>Right. then we'll come with you.</i>

1252
01:09:23.833 --> 01:09:27.291
<i>Notify Count Rossi of our suspicions</i>
<i>and have him delay the coronation.</i>

1253
01:09:27.375 --> 01:09:28.666
<i>Right away. Your Highness.</i>

1254
01:09:29.333 --> 01:09:30.166
<i>Bingo.</i>

1255
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.333
<i>I honestly don't understand the urgency.</i>

1256
01:09:36.416 --> 01:09:38.500
<i>Then I shall review it for you again.</i>

1257
01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:43.916
<i>I intend to spend Christmas with</i>
<i>those poor. poor orphans at St. Matthew's.</i>

1258
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.666
<i>Aren't the orphans at St. Michael's?</i>

1259
01:09:46.833 --> 01:09:48.083
<i>I am in charge</i>

1260
01:09:48.166 --> 01:09:52.500
<i>and you as my loyal subject must do</i>
<i>precisely what I tell you to do.</i>

1261
01:09:53.083 --> 01:09:53.916
<i>[sighs]</i>

1262
01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:57.458
<i>I would…</i>

1263
01:09:58.541 --> 01:10:00.333
<i>if you were really Lady Margaret.</i>

1264
01:10:01.708 --> 01:10:03.958
<i>But you're not. are you?</i>

1265
01:10:04.791 --> 01:10:06.916
<i>How dare you question me!</i>

1266
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.208
<i>You're Margaret's cousin.</i>

1267
01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:09.291
<i>[gasps]</i>

1268
01:10:09.375 --> 01:10:11.666
<i>-I'll have you arrested for treason.</i>
<i>-I don't think you will</i>

1269
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:13.958
<i>-because I can prove it.</i>
<i>-I'm calling the guards!</i>

1270
01:10:14.041 --> 01:10:16.166
<i>All it takes is a close look at your hand.</i>

1271
01:10:16.875 --> 01:10:18.500
<i>The little tattoo on your pinkie…</i>

1272
01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.500
<i>you should take greater care</i>
<i>to cover it up.</i>

1273
01:10:26.458 --> 01:10:27.791
<i>So now what?</i>

1274
01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:30.625
<i>I'm guessing you're after money.</i>

1275
01:10:31.291 --> 01:10:35.208
<i>You're not stupid enough to think that</i>
<i>you can maintain this charade for long.</i>

1276
01:10:36.625 --> 01:10:40.208
<i>So you can either make me a partner</i>
<i>in your little scheme</i>

1277
01:10:41.125 --> 01:10:44.625
<i>or be exposed</i>
<i>as an impostor and a traitor.</i>

1278
01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:47.875
<i>You don't need my money.</i>
<i>You're filthy rich.</i>

1279
01:10:47.958 --> 01:10:51.458
<i>My eldest brother inherited</i>
<i>the majority of the family estate.</i>

1280
01:10:51.958 --> 01:10:55.791
<i>which left me with expensive tastes</i>
<i>and a very small income.</i>

1281
01:10:56.666 --> 01:10:57.583
<i>[sighs]</i>

1282
01:10:58.833 --> 01:11:00.166
<i>What about Margaret?</i>

1283
01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:02.625
<i>Once you've gotten what you came for.</i>

1284
01:11:02.708 --> 01:11:06.750
<i>you'll vanish without a trace. which means</i>
<i>Margaret never has to know anything.</i>

1285
01:11:08.166 --> 01:11:10.708
<i>I'll make sure the coronation</i>
<i>happens tonight.</i>

1286
01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:15.375
<i>And afterwards. you'll meet</i>
<i>with the Chancellor of the Exchequer</i>

1287
01:11:15.458 --> 01:11:19.041
<i>and make an incredibly generous donation</i>
<i>to a fictitious charity</i>

1288
01:11:19.125 --> 01:11:21.500
<i>of which you</i>
<i>are the Chief Financial Officer.</i>

1289
01:11:22.333 --> 01:11:25.083
<i>As soon as you write a check to me</i>
<i>for my services.</i>

1290
01:11:25.166 --> 01:11:27.500
<i>I'll arrange for your discreet departure.</i>

1291
01:11:28.708 --> 01:11:31.000
<i>You can do whatever you like</i>
<i>with the rest of the money.</i>

1292
01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:38.416
<i>When we arrive. everyone keep alert.</i>

1293
01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.500
<i>There's no telling</i>
<i>what we'll find when we get there.</i>

1294
01:11:40.583 --> 01:11:44.541
<i>Mm-hmm. And it's a good thing</i>
<i>that these are registered weapons.</i>

1295
01:11:44.625 --> 01:11:46.875
<i>-Frank! Hands on the wheel!</i>
<i>-All right!</i>

1296
01:11:52.833 --> 01:11:54.000
<i>[hums softly]</i>

1297
01:11:56.416 --> 01:11:59.000
<i>Your dinner is served.</i>

1298
01:12:01.666 --> 01:12:02.666
<i>Hello?</i>

1299
01:12:05.208 --> 01:12:07.125
<i>Your Highnesty?</i>

1300
01:12:08.166 --> 01:12:09.916
<i>Hello?</i>

1301
01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:16.125
<i>You playing hide and seek? </i>

1302
01:12:18.958 --> 01:12:20.416
<i>You are!</i>

1303
01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:22.333
<i>[Stacy grunts]</i>

1304
01:12:23.541 --> 01:12:26.458
<i>[screaming]</i>

1305
01:12:26.541 --> 01:12:27.958
<i>[grunts]</i>

1306
01:12:28.041 --> 01:12:29.166
<i>[Reggie whimpers]</i>

1307
01:12:31.875 --> 01:12:34.958
<i>[gasping]</i>

1308
01:12:36.833 --> 01:12:37.666
<i>[Reggie] Oy!</i>

1309
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:40.375
<i>Oy! Come here!</i>

1310
01:12:40.458 --> 01:12:42.666
<i>-[Stacy panting]</i>
<i>-[Reggie grunting]</i>

1311
01:12:44.791 --> 01:12:46.000
<i>Oh my God.</i>

1312
01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:47.250
<i>[Stacy grunts]</i>

1313
01:12:47.333 --> 01:12:49.541
<i>[Reggie yelling]</i>

1314
01:12:57.166 --> 01:12:58.125
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

1315
01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:01.250
<i>[Reggie] Mindy! Get her!</i>

1316
01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:03.166
<i>Where do you think you're going? Oh!</i>

1317
01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:04.833
<i>[screaming]</i>

1318
01:13:09.791 --> 01:13:11.458
<i>[Mindy] Help! Help me. Reggie.</i>

1319
01:13:12.416 --> 01:13:16.333
<i>[pounding] Reggie. get me out of here.</i>
<i>Get me out of here. Reggie!</i>

1320
01:13:17.625 --> 01:13:18.708
<i>Oh! Whoa! Oh!</i>

1321
01:13:18.791 --> 01:13:20.125
<i>-Sir…</i>
<i>-[Margaret] Oh dear. Edward!</i>

1322
01:13:20.208 --> 01:13:22.125
<i>Stacy? Can you hear me?</i>

1323
01:13:22.208 --> 01:13:23.666
<i>[panting]</i>

1324
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:24.791
<i>-[Edward] Stacy?</i>
<i>-Thank God.</i>

1325
01:13:24.875 --> 01:13:25.750
<i>Come here!</i>

1326
01:13:27.666 --> 01:13:28.541
<i>[screaming]</i>

1327
01:13:28.625 --> 01:13:30.666
<i>They're over there! Go!</i>

1328
01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:35.208
<i>-Call the police! Frank. you're with me!</i>
<i>-Always. sir. Always!</i>

1329
01:13:35.291 --> 01:13:37.083
<i>-[Stacy grunts]</i>
<i>-[Edward] Get away from her!</i>

1330
01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:41.000
<i>[hollers]</i>

1331
01:13:41.666 --> 01:13:42.541
<i>[grunts]</i>

<i>[Stacy and Edward gasp]</i>

1334
01:13:48.583 --> 01:13:49.833
<i>[Stacy] Oh!</i>

1335
01:13:50.083 --> 01:13:53.083
<i>I'm so sorry. </i>
<i>I should have told you everything.</i>

1336
01:13:53.166 --> 01:13:55.416
<i>As long as you're all right.</i>
<i>that's all that matters.</i>

1337
01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:59.458
<i>I promise you I will never make you</i>
<i>feel like I'm too busy for you ever again.</i>

1338
01:13:59.541 --> 01:14:02.708
<i>And I promise I will never hover</i>
<i>like a helicopter again.</i>

1339
01:14:02.791 --> 01:14:03.875
<i>Wait. what?</i>

1340
01:14:03.958 --> 01:14:05.083
<i>-It doesn't matter.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

1341
01:14:08.083 --> 01:14:09.208
<i>Margaret--</i>

1342
01:14:09.291 --> 01:14:10.208
<i>[grunts]</i>

1343
01:14:11.291 --> 01:14:14.000
<i>[clears throat] I'm so terribly sorry</i>
<i>to interrupt. Your Graces.</i>

1344
01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:16.166
<i>but Fiona is headed to the cathedral.</i>

1345
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:17.416
<i>Right. let's go.</i>

1346
01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:26.541
<i>-[organ music playing]</i>
<i>-[voices murmuring]</i>

1347
01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:28.583
<i>[archbishop] This is highly irregular.</i>

1348
01:14:29.333 --> 01:14:32.500
<i>The coronation is scheduled</i>
<i>for tomorrow on Christmas Day.</i>

1349
01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:35.500
<i>But I'm going to be</i>
<i>at St. Michael's on Christmas Day.</i>

1350
01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:37.875
<i>I've promised the orphans.</i>

1351
01:14:37.958 --> 01:14:40.000
<i>I thought the orphans</i>
<i>were at St. Matthew's.</i>

1352
01:14:41.333 --> 01:14:44.166
<i>It's a world tour of orphans.</i>

1353
01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:46.500
<i>[Antonio] It may be an unusual request.</i>
<i>Your Excellency.</i>

1354
01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:48.708
<i>but there's nothing</i>
<i>in canon or civil law</i>

1355
01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:52.791
<i>that prevents an heir apparent</i>
<i>from selecting the date of the coronation.</i>

1356
01:14:52.875 --> 01:14:54.208
<i>-[door opens]</i>
<i>-I know the law. sir.</i>

1357
01:14:54.291 --> 01:14:57.458
<i>and it clearly states that</i>
<i>a representative of the civil government</i>

1358
01:14:57.541 --> 01:14:59.833
<i>must be in attendance</i>
<i>when a new monarch is crowned.</i>

1359
01:14:59.916 --> 01:15:02.041
<i>I spoke to the Prime Minister an hour ago.</i>

1360
01:15:02.708 --> 01:15:04.291
<i>And here she is now.</i>

1361
01:15:08.458 --> 01:15:09.583
<i>I see.</i>

1362
01:15:10.458 --> 01:15:12.250
<i>We'll need some time to prepare.</i>

1363
01:15:24.625 --> 01:15:26.833
<i>Wait a second.</i>
<i>wasn't that the turnoff for the airport?</i>

1364
01:15:26.916 --> 01:15:31.416
<i>It was. but the bridge got washed away</i>
<i>six months ago.</i>

1365
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.750
<i>Terrible flood.</i>

1366
01:15:32.833 --> 01:15:34.833
<i>A flood? In June?</i>

1367
01:15:34.916 --> 01:15:37.416
<i>Summer storms can be so unpredictable.</i>

1368
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.833
<i>-As long as we don't miss our flight. man.</i>
<i>-We wouldn't want that.</i>

1369
01:15:42.958 --> 01:15:45.208
<i>Is Your Majesty willing and able</i>

1370
01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:48.791
<i>to take this sacred oath</i>
<i>to uphold the laws and customs</i>

1371
01:15:48.875 --> 01:15:51.125
<i>of the Sovereign Nation of Montenaro?</i>

1372
01:15:51.208 --> 01:15:52.500
<i>Yes. I am.</i>

1373
01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:55.500
<i>Willing and able.</i>

1374
01:15:56.041 --> 01:15:57.791
<i>Then repeat after me.</i>

1375
01:15:58.541 --> 01:16:01.375
<i>I. Margaret Katherine Claire Delacourt…</i>

1376
01:16:01.958 --> 01:16:04.041
<i>I. Margaret Clara Karen--</i>

1377
01:16:04.125 --> 01:16:06.166
<i>Margaret Katherine Claire.</i>

1378
01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:09.208
<i>I. Margaret Katherine Claire…</i>

1379
01:16:10.083 --> 01:16:12.375
<i>-Dela--</i>
<i>-Delacourt. right.</i>

1380
01:16:13.708 --> 01:16:16.500
<i>I. Margaret Katherine Claire Delacourt--</i>

1381
01:16:16.583 --> 01:16:19.875
<i>I command you to stop</i>
<i>these proceedings at once.</i>

1382
01:16:22.458 --> 01:16:25.000
<i>Oh. dear Lord. There are three of them.</i>

1383
01:16:25.083 --> 01:16:26.666
<i>No. Your Eminence.</i>

1384
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:29.541
<i>There is only one Margaret Delacourt</i>
<i>and I am she.</i>

1385
01:16:30.125 --> 01:16:33.125
<i>The woman you were about to crown</i>
<i>as your queen is an impostor.</i>

1386
01:16:34.166 --> 01:16:35.666
<i>Antonio. tell them.</i>

1387
01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:39.875
<i>Guards.</i>
<i>arrest this woman at once for treason.</i>

1388
01:16:39.958 --> 01:16:41.000
<i>Antonio. it's me.</i>

1389
01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.666
<i>Don't you dare!</i>

1390
01:16:44.208 --> 01:16:45.041
<i>And you are?</i>

1391
01:16:45.125 --> 01:16:49.041
<i>I'm Princess Stacy Juliette</i>
<i>De Novo Wyndham of Belgravia.</i>

1392
01:16:49.666 --> 01:16:52.250
<i>Fiona kidnapped me</i>
<i>thinking I was Margaret.</i>

1393
01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:55.208
<i>but I wasn't Margaret</i>
<i>because Margaret and I switched places.</i>

1394
01:16:55.291 --> 01:16:56.958
<i>I'm very confused.</i>

1395
01:16:57.041 --> 01:16:59.625
<i>I understand exactly how you feel.</i>
<i>Your Eminence.</i>

1396
01:17:00.208 --> 01:17:02.000
<i>but it seems the woman</i>
<i>you're about to crown</i>

1397
01:17:02.083 --> 01:17:04.375
<i>is actually Lady Margaret's cousin.</i>

1398
01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:06.583
<i>Is this true?</i>

1399
01:17:08.208 --> 01:17:09.958
<i>Fiona. it's over.</i>

1400
01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:14.166
<i>-Reggie and Mindy are in police custody.</i>
<i>-They confessed to everything.</i>

1401
01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:15.166
<i>[sighs]</i>

1402
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:17.916
<i>Oh. all right. it's me.</i>

1403
01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:22.458
<i>but I didn't want to go through with it.</i>
<i>That freak Antonio made me do it.</i>

1404
01:17:23.583 --> 01:17:24.750
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1405
01:17:24.833 --> 01:17:26.916
<i>Margaret. she's lying.</i>

1406
01:17:27.416 --> 01:17:29.666
<i>You were ready to throw me in prison.</i>

1407
01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:32.916
<i>Look. if you'll only just listen to me--</i>

1408
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.250
<i>I've listened long enough.</i>

1409
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.875
<i>You almost had me convinced</i>
<i>that I wasn't ready to rule on my own.</i>

1410
01:17:39.625 --> 01:17:43.458
<i>but the fact is I've never been</i>
<i>more ready for anything in my life.</i>

1411
01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:45.791
<i>I love Montenaro.</i>

1412
01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:49.125
<i>I love its people and I've learned</i>
<i>everything I can about them</i>

1413
01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:52.708
<i>for the past six months. so I can</i>
<i>serve them to the best of my ability.</i>

1414
01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:54.916
<i>You don't know how to command.</i>

1415
01:17:56.333 --> 01:17:57.291
<i>Watch this.</i>

1416
01:17:57.375 --> 01:18:01.166
<i>Arrest him and take him to the dungeon.</i>

1417
01:18:07.458 --> 01:18:08.833
<i>I bet that felt good.</i>

1418
01:18:09.583 --> 01:18:10.958
<i>You have no idea.</i>

1419

<i>[door opens]</i>

<i>[door closes]</i>

1421
01:18:14.416 --> 01:18:16.833
<i>One tiny teeny little question.</i>

1422
01:18:17.375 --> 01:18:21.750
<i>Since I technically didn't kidnap you.</i>
<i>am I really guilty?</i>

1423
01:18:22.791 --> 01:18:23.791
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1424
01:18:23.875 --> 01:18:27.708
<i>But. Maggie Moo.</i>
<i>it's Christmas and I'm your cuzzy.</i>

1425
01:18:27.791 --> 01:18:30.375
<i>Are you kidding? You committed treason!</i>

1426
01:18:30.458 --> 01:18:32.166
<i>Well. I didn't mean to.</i>

1427
01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.000
<i>[scoffs]</i>

1428
01:18:34.083 --> 01:18:36.375
<i>You know. it's always been hard for me.</i>

1429
01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:38.791
<i>growing up with parents who despised me.</i>

1430
01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:41.250
<i>They didn't despise you.</i>

1431
01:18:43.625 --> 01:18:46.666
<i>The truth is</i>
<i>I've always wanted to be you.</i>

1432
01:18:47.291 --> 01:18:49.125
<i>I just got carried away this time.</i>

1433
01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:52.833
<i>But I could never be half of what you are.</i>

1434
01:18:54.208 --> 01:18:58.916
<i>You were born to be queen. even</i>
<i>though you didn't realize until now.</i>

1435
01:18:59.958 --> 01:19:01.958
<i>I owe you an apology. Moo.</i>

1436
01:19:02.041 --> 01:19:04.833
<i>I behaved abominably. I'm sorry.</i>

1437
01:19:05.708 --> 01:19:08.416
<i>You're the only real family I've ever had.</i>

1438
01:19:09.833 --> 01:19:11.458
<i>The only one who truly cares.</i>

1439
01:19:11.541 --> 01:19:14.166
<i>Poor. poor girl.</i>

1440
01:19:15.041 --> 01:19:16.708
<i>-Oh. please.</i>
<i>-[Frank] What?</i>

1441
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.416
<i>I suppose I could ask the judge</i>
<i>for a reduced sentence.</i>

1442
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:22.750
<i>[Stacy] Are you sure about that?</i>

1443
01:19:23.333 --> 01:19:27.083
<i>Along with supervised community</i>
<i>service for many. many years.</i>

1444
01:19:27.166 --> 01:19:28.750
<i>[archbishop] I hate to interrupt.</i>

1445

<i>but are we proceeding</i>
<i>with the coronation?</i>

1446

<i>The coronation will proceed</i>
<i>on Christmas Day as scheduled.</i>

1447
01:19:35.875 --> 01:19:39.625
<i>Now if you all will excuse me.</i>
<i>I really must call Kevin.</i>

1448

<i>[Fiona] About Kevin…</i>

1450
01:19:43.208 --> 01:19:44.666
<i>What about Kevin?</i>

1451
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:47.541
<i>He would have found me out.</i>
<i>so I had to send him packing.</i>

<i>[Edward] Oh. dear.</i>

<i>You mean Olivia?</i>
