00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:29.320
Hi (exhales sharply).

4
00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.116
My name is Kayla.

5
00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:33.992
I'm 28.

6
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.122
And my boyfriend
is an alcoholic.

7
00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:40.373
And an addict.

8
00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.167
And quite frankly.
he's an asshole.

9
00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.169
especially when he's using.

10
00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.337
Well. I mean. mostly
when he's using.

11
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.966
And I have tried everything

12
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.886
that I could to help
and support him.

13
00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:56.181
And you know what?

14
00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:58.850
I'm exhausted.

15
00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.520
I am literally at my wits end.

16
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.649
I took him to rehab.
AA. sober living.

17
00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:07.901
Nice places.

18
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.986
You know he'd get sober
and it would be great.

19
00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:10.904
But guess what?

20
00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.865
No flowers. no trips. nothing.

21
00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.117
Nothing really changed.
but it was cozy.

22
00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:17.827
it was comfortable.
we were here together

23
00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:18.870
and it was beautiful.

24
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:22.040
And then he would relapse.

25
00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:24.709
I don't know why. what did I do?

26
00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:26.669
Did I not. did I
not love him enough?

27
00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:28.129
Did I not try enough?

28
00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.466
What did I do wrong?

29
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.051
And I fucking tried.

30
00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:39.390
I'm still here. and he
doesn't even acknowledge that.

31
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.893
He doesn't even acknowledge
that I've wasted

32
00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:45.313
four years of my life for him.

33
00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.900
So I'm gonna do
something unconventional.

34
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.987
I am going to film
this entire thing.

35
00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:57.992
from finding you. to
your whole detox process.

36
00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:00.537
to you becoming sober.

37
00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.333
Kayla.
are you done yet?

38
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.963
Oh God. I don't
want it to be real.

39
00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:12.757
I don't wanna be
done with him (sobs).

40
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:15.552
I just want him back.

41
00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.681
I just want him back.

42
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:21.432
God. I'm a baby.

43
00:02:23.434 --> 00:02:24.769
We gotta go find him.

44
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.021
- Let's go.
- We gotta go find him.

45
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:28.439
Okay. let's go.

46
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.317

- Yeah.

running across the street
to this random stranger.

85
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.872
And?
- He's not there.

86
00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:51.416
- Okay.
- They kicked him out

87
00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.751
like the first day
he disappeared. so.

88
00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:55.003
That's a big surprise.

89
00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.462
Yeah well
he was with Wayne.

90
00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:58.089
which is good because Wayne
lives really close to here. so-

91
00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.590
Right. his dealer?

92
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.758
Yeah. it's good that he's
with Wayne. thank God.

93
00:05:00.758 --> 00:05:01.718
Yeah. you know what?

94
00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.177
It is good that he's with Wayne.

95
00:05:03.177 --> 00:05:05.471
because Wayne probably held
him up for a while. so.

96
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:06.764
Put him up.

97
00:05:06.764 --> 00:05:09.267
Yeah and
also got him fucked up.

98
00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.439
Yes we're close. we are close

99
00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.737
to finding yet another disaster.

100
00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.448
Richard or creepy netflag.

101
00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.699
I'm not looking in the tents.

102
00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.616
I'm not getting out.

103
00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:26.784
You have to get out and do this.

104
00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:27.994
I am not. I
don't wanna get out

105
00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.120
and look in the fucking tents.

106
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.747
I'm so afraid down here.

107
00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:34.125
I hate this area.
- Oh. oh. oh my God.

108
00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.626
Who is
that. is that him?

109
00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:38.087
This is just
so. like why do we have to

110
00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:40.173
put together clues to find him?

111
00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.091
Like who is this random person?

112
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:43.301
I get it
but we're close.

113
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.678
Who does he
hang out with. whatever.

114
00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:47.722
How much longer are
we gonna be out here?

115
00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:50.975
I don't know.

116
00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.143
I mean. I'm gonna
be here all night.

117
00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.728
If you wanna go home.
you can go home.

118
00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.646
I can swing back
by the apartment.

119
00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:57.982
Mm-hm. yup. 'cause
I'm gonna leave you alone.

120
00:05:57.982 --> 00:05:59.609
I'm just saying

121
00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.027
this isn't fair.

122
00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:03.363
- Oh shit he just texted me.
- What no (scoffs).

123
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:06.199
Oh my God. I'm
gonna ping his location.

124
00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.658
He texted
you after five days?

125
00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:09.118
Oh my God.
we are right here.

126
00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:10.620
What a douche.

127
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.955
Oh my God. we are
right here. Dayna. oh my God.

128
00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:13.998
Okay.
well. he's alive.

129
00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.416
let's chill.
- I know.

130
00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:17.126
He's just been
a douche bag once again.

131
00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:18.961
so let's treat him sensitively.

132
00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:20.380
Let's just try
this alley really quick

133
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.881
and just see if he's over there.

134
00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.049
Yep. let's just try
this alley. you and I. yup.

135
00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:23.883
Okay. cool.

136
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.722
- Look really close.
- Yeah. I see

137
00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:30.848
a bunch of dumpsters.

138
00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:32.683
- Richard!
- Is that him?

139
00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:34.769
- Stop it.
- Richard!

140
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:35.978
- Look for him.
- Dick!

141
00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.946
Oh. all right.
- Oh my God!

142
00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:49.617
- Oh. holy shit.
- Oh my God.

143
00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:50.785
There he is.

144
00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:51.661
Kayla.
wait. whoa whoa whoa.

145
00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:52.870
Oh fuck.

146
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.997
Oh my God. look at
him. Dayna. I can't.

147
00:07:00.878 --> 00:07:03.172
Is he just
sitting in trash?

148
00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.552
Hey. hi.

149
00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.471
Kayla.

150
00:07:13.307 --> 00:07:16.686
I'm good. what.
wait. wait. wait.

151
00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.312
Here. sit down.

152
00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:19.730
Sit down.
- Come on.

153
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.899
Come on. sit down.

154
00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:23.901
Sit down. what-
- What the?

155
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:26.737
These. you see
'em. where is it?

156
00:07:27.905 --> 00:07:29.157
Where is it?

157
00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.534
That. is that it.
is that the pill?

158
00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.453
- What?
- Yeah.

159
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.079
there's the little guy.

160
00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:36.247
- Honey.
- You gotta take this.

161
00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:37.582
You've gotta try this one time.

162
00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:38.666
You'll go to the moon.

163
00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:39.959
- Okay.
- Is what this will do.

164
00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:40.877
Yeah. well. I wanna go home.

165
00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:41.711
You want it?

166
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:42.879
I'll take it.

167
00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.088
You and I are
gonna. no. no. no. no.

168
00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:44.922
Get that. babe. get
that out of your mouth

169
00:07:44.922 --> 00:07:45.840
right fucking now.

170
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.632
Get it out of your mouth!

171
00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.969
Fuck. God dammit.
you're disgusting.

172
00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.305
Do you see how
embarrassing you are?

173
00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.348
Ever since your dad died.
you think that you can have

174
00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:55.183
some fucking excuse-
- Don't fucking.

175
00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.893
don't fucking. hey!

176
00:07:58.853 --> 00:07:59.645
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.316
Don't talk about
my fucking dad.

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:05.276
Okay?

179
00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:09.947
You know that subject

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:11.824
Honey. I'm sorry.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.244
You okay?

- Okay. come on. honey.

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:22.710
We're gonna go home.

Yeah. I'll go. here we go.

187
00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:27.590
Stop. come on.

Okay. oh God.

00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:50.029
Oh. and there he goes again.

00:08:50.988 --> 00:08:52.949
Dude. I am so.

Oh shit. man. this

Hey. you're a fucking bitch.

What. what's with the

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.678
What are you doing
with a camera?

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.680
- Oh my God.
- What are you doing?

209
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.056
It's for a project.
don't worry about it.

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:18.224
Come on. let's go.

All for you. buddy.

213
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.937
Just get in the car.
- I'm getting in the car.

214
00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.355
In the car.

00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:31.279
- Holy shit. dude.

217
00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:37.034
Geez. oh my. how

218
00:09:37.034 --> 00:09:39.287
and you-
- Hey. there's a camera.

219
00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.080
Food?

221
00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:43.708

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:49.547
Okay. oh
wow. horrendous.

223
00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:52.049
This whole experience.

224
00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:56.220
Okay. oh. is it just me
or does he smells worse

225
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.597
with every step?

226
00:09:58.764 --> 00:09:59.932
- Oh. Dayna.
- I can't. I can't.

227
00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.644
Ah. come on. babe.

228
00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:05.980
Walk forward. please.

229
00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.649
Do you remember our bed?

Right here.

Oh God.

233
00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:17.241
Honey. can you please

234
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:18.659
- No.

235
00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:19.619
right now.
- I don't want to.

236
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.578
It's covered in vomit.

237
00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:21.912
Take your shirt off. please.

238
00:10:21.912 --> 00:10:23.497
- I don't want to.
- Can you please take it off.

239
00:10:23.497 --> 00:10:25.708
I don't

240
00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:29.837
I'm sorry.

241
00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.427
Just sleep. okay?

242
00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:38.429
Okay.

00:10:44.268 --> 00:10:45.269
Kayla.

244
00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:51.108
Babe.

245
00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:53.986
Oh my God.

246
00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:00.326
Babe.

247
00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.243
Damn it.

248
00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:11.504
Well. Richard. you've sent
us on another scavenger hunt.

249
00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:14.006
Huh?

250
00:11:16.133 --> 00:11:17.802
What did you find
up there. girl?

251
00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:18.969
Put it in the magic bowl.

252
00:11:18.969 --> 00:11:21.305
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

253
00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:22.139
Cool.

254
00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:23.557
You know you could help.

255
00:11:23.557 --> 00:11:28.562
I. oh nice. this
antique tea set

256
00:11:29.313 --> 00:11:30.856
that Mom and Dad got us.

257
00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:32.566
Perfect place.

258
00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:35.403
I never use it.
so. I guess. yes.

259
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.365
Respect. babe.

260
00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:42.993
Aw. fuck.

261
00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:44.328
Oh dear. okay.

262
00:11:44.328 --> 00:11:46.414
Well. this was lazy. Richard.

263
00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:49.041
I don't cook.

264
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:50.000
You don't cook?

265
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.919
Are you ever in your home?

266
00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:53.462
Do you open these
cupboards ever?

267
00:11:53.462 --> 00:11:55.089
Do you go to the grocery store?

268
00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:56.465
Not really.

269
00:11:57.925 --> 00:12:00.720
Well. here's just
what we found so far.

270
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.889
Just a little
smattering of. ya know.

271
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.600
Do you have to be so
smug and rude about it?

272
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.102
Yeah. I do.

273
00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:09.687
Look. I don't care if
you don't want to help him

274
00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:11.313
or give a shit about him.

275
00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:13.190
I just want you to
support me. that's it.

276
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.525
I've been supporting you.

277
00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:17.862
I have to watch you
in pain all the time.

278
00:12:19.363 --> 00:12:24.368
And you. you refuse. you
refuse to just end it.

279
00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:31.125
And honestly. I feel
pretty degraded myself.

280
00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:33.669
You choose this piece
of shit over like

281
00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:35.379

It's a lot. babe.

285
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.521
♪ Don't you understand.
understand. understand ♪

286
00:12:58.068 --> 00:13:00.738
I know I don't say thank
you a lot and I don't express

287
00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:01.739
my gratitude to you.

288
00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:05.451
But I thank you and I love you.

289
00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:10.623
- I love you too.
- I promise you this is it.

290
00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:13.209
This is it. this'll
be the last time.

291
00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:14.043
And I'm done.

292
00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.923
- Promise?
- I do. I will.

293
00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.216
I promise.

294
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.761
It's bad.

295
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:25.930
It's like homemade-
- That's fermented.

296
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.139
Oh my God. it's everywhere.

297
00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.390
How do I not see this. Dayna?

298
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.226
How do you not see this. babe.

299
00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:31.435
It's doesn't even have a.

300
00:13:31.435 --> 00:13:33.229
it doesn't even have
a wrapper on it.

301
00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:36.315
I don't know. I have no words.

302
00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:39.109
She's just. I'm not in my
kitchen. I work full time.

303
00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:39.944
You eat?

304
00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:45.449
Richard. you are one
sneaky motherfucker.

305
00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:49.245
Maybe a masculine
energy is what he needs.

306
00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:50.955
Maybe I'm too weak.

307
00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:55.292
No. you are not
too weak. my friend.

308
00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:57.294
- I feel weak.
- Masculine energy my ass.

309
00:13:57.294 --> 00:14:00.464
That guy's just gotta get
his head out of his ass.

310
00:14:01.298 --> 00:14:03.050
David. hi.

311
00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:08.597
Yeah. yeah. yeah. I did. um.

In an alley off of
Gower. actually.

313
00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:16.480
Mm-hm. yeah he's passed out
in the bedroom right now.

314
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.481
So he's safe.

315
00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:24.405
Mm-hm. yeah. ten in the
morning tomorrow would be good.

316
00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:27.408
And then. um. then we'll go up
to the mountains at my dad's.

317
00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:30.578
You too. yeah. you too.

318
00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.204
Okay. drive safe.

319
00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:53.809

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:56.979
How's it going?

322
00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:58.689
How's he doing?

323
00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:00.024
Hey. how are you?

324
00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.152
Where is he.
how's he. how's he doing?

325
00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:04.320
He is alive.

326
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.905
So that's one thing.

327
00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.364
And. um. he's in the shower.

328
00:15:07.364 --> 00:15:09.241
Okay. good.

329
00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:11.535
So. thank you for driving
all the way down here.

330
00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:12.995
I know that's a really long way.

331
00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:14.747
No. he's. I mean. he's
one of my best friends.

332
00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.206
it's really not a
big deal at all.

333
00:15:16.206 --> 00:15:18.709
I'm. I'm sorry for not
being around as much as I

334
00:15:19.793 --> 00:15:20.711
really should be.
- It's okay.

335
00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:22.212
It's just. I don't know.

336
00:15:22.212 --> 00:15:25.591
You know. our drinking nights
when we used to smoke weed

337
00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:28.302
and all of that. they've.
they've kinda just changed.

338
00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:31.597
And now he just.
smokes until oblivion

339
00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:35.059
and becomes a dick. so.
- Yeah. I know.

340
00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:37.019
I live with him now
so. I understand.

341
00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:39.271
Yeah. I think it's
amazing what you're doing.

342

help. obviously. I'm here. so.

Um. do you want some water?

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.754
Ah. he is in the shower.

352
00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:06.215
You got him to bathe?

353
00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:08.592
I did. yeah. he was
disgusting last night.

354
00:16:08.592 --> 00:16:09.760
full of vomit and piss.

355
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.096
it was-
- He really turned over

356
00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:13.472
that new leaf then.

357
00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:14.682
- Hopefully.
- Okay.

358
00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:16.433
How are you?
- Good.

359
00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:17.935
Same old. ya know.

360
00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:20.145
Really appreciate
you calling me.

361
00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:21.230
But not really though.

362
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.773
'cause I don't wanna be here.

363
00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:26.777
But. my mom's always told
me sometimes you help people

364
00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:28.612
not 'cause they deserve it.

365
00:16:28.612 --> 00:16:31.073
but because it's the
right thing to do. so.

366
00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:37.997
Look. I'm. I'm sorry. I
should've. I should've called.

367
00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.623
I'm really embarrassed by
what happened at your job.

368
00:16:39.623 --> 00:16:42.626
I wanted. I should've asked
you how everything was there.

369
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.671
About as good as it can be.

370
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.715
I still get flagged for
bringing in the asshole

371
00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:50.718
that pissed in the trash can
and gave my boss the finger.

372
00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:53.595
but other than that. it's good.

373
00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:56.140
Kinda.
- By the way. this is David.

374
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.434
David. this is Richard's
childhood friend.

375
00:16:58.434 --> 00:16:59.643
- Hey. man.
- Um. you can have a seat.

376
00:16:59.643 --> 00:17:00.853
I'll get you guys some water.

377
00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.522
And um. yeah.
- What's up. bro?

378
00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:04.898
Feel like I know your face.

379
00:17:04.898 --> 00:17:06.025
Ah. the funeral.

380
00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:07.484
For Richard's dad.
- Gotcha.

381
00:17:07.484 --> 00:17:08.986
- Yeah.
- Good man. good man.

382
00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:10.571
Yeah. yeah. he was.

383
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:13.949
Thank you.
- Thank you.

384
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:17.578
Oh hey. where's
the vomit-stained party boy?

385
00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:19.413
I just said that
exact same thing.

386
00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:21.248
but you said it
way more negative.

387
00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:22.458
Yeah I meant it negative.

388
00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:23.834
He's a dick.

389
00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:25.669
I don't have a lot
of faith in this.

390
00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:30.174
I mean. what has it been?

391
00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:33.302
Four rehabs. two
outpatient facilities?

392
00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:34.887
Countless drunk
and disorderliness.

393
00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.805
that was so embarrassing.

394
00:17:38.807 --> 00:17:40.350
It's not a strong chance
this is gonna work

395
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.102
but I am here. I am here.

396
00:17:42.102 --> 00:17:43.395
And you promised me. so.

397
00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:46.273
With my camcorder. so.

398
00:17:46.273 --> 00:17:49.693
I don't know how you
guys feel. but for me.

399
00:17:49.693 --> 00:17:52.571
if this trip doesn't
work. I'm finally done.

400
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:55.532
Yo eh. let me just say.
my hat if off to you.

401
00:17:55.532 --> 00:17:59.161
I don't know how you got
Rich of all people to agree

402
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:01.246
to go on a nature trip.

403
00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:03.665
Don't. don't get me wrong.
he loves his trips. right?

404
00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:07.753
You got your shroom trips.
you got the acid trips. but-

405
00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.713
The stair trips. up
and down the stairs.

406
00:18:09.713 --> 00:18:11.256
- Something like that.
- Right. right. right?

407
00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:14.384
He do those but a nature
trip. we gonna need Gandhi

408
00:18:14.384 --> 00:18:16.720
to keep him level-headed
up there. like-

409
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.972
I don't even know if Gandhi
can handle Richard actually.

410
00:18:18.972 --> 00:18:21.058
I think we need
like a survivalist.

411
00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:22.392
like someone with a big knife.

412
00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:25.729
Like a Bear Grylls or a
Steve Irwin or something.

413
00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:27.231
That's my guy.

414
00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:28.607
I don't know Bear Grylls or
whatever but Steve Irwin.

415
00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.109
that's my dude. man.

416
00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.569
After he passed. bro. it
still stings to this day.

417
00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:34.029
- Really?
- Oh come on.

418
00:18:35.155 --> 00:18:37.366
Guys. you guys. I
don't think that we need

419
00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:40.869
to put our eggs in one
basket to all these heroes.

420
00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:41.787
Do you know what I mean?

421
00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:43.372
I think we can be those heroes.

422
00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:44.706
That's why you guys are here.

423
00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:46.500
It's what we can do.

424
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.378
We might not all have
as much conviction as you.

425
00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:51.880
But we're still here.

426
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.550
And we all know that there's
a good guy inside of Richard.

427
00:18:55.717 --> 00:18:56.969
We. we do.

428
00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:58.095
And we really hope
we see him again.

429
00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:02.057
Kayla. where is my fucking?

430
00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:07.437
Hello. everyone.

431
00:19:07.437 --> 00:19:08.772
- Welcome back.
- Yeah.

432
00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:11.316
- Thanks for the shower.
- Kayla. what the fuck?

433
00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:14.236
Like what is. what. what
is everyone doing here?

434
00:19:15.779 --> 00:19:18.198
We're here
because we love you.

435
00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:21.451
Speak for yourself.

436
00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:23.120
Correct.

437
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.246
We-

438
00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:25.289
- Love Kayla.
- We're here because.

439
00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.711
I invited everyone here
babe. because we. well.

440
00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:33.672
quite frankly. you
have a problem.

441
00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:35.174
And you know you have a problem.

442
00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:39.303
Dayna and I were up all night
going through my apartment

443
00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:40.512
looking for your shit.

444
00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:43.932
So if anyone has to hide
their stash or liqueur

445
00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:46.852
inside fucking water
bottles and put them

446
00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:50.314
under who God knows where.
has a fucking problem.

447
00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:51.481
Do you understand?

448
00:19:52.482 --> 00:19:53.317
Wake up!

449
00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:55.819
There is no other
way to put it.

450
00:19:57.321 --> 00:19:58.155
Whoa.

451
00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:00.616
Ooh. whoa.
- Sorry.

452
00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:03.911
I didn't mean to come
off so rude right there.

453
00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:06.705
Things got really serious
up in here. didn't they?

454
00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:10.918
I was actually hoping
that maybe you guys

455
00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:12.127
wanted to hang out.

456
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:17.132
I know. um. you probably
flushed my weed.

457
00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:19.760
but I'm sure I could
get something delivered.

458
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.262
Do you. do you
hear yourself. man?

459
00:20:22.262 --> 00:20:23.597
What are you talking about?

460
00:20:24.848 --> 00:20:26.391
Kayla. he does not respect you.

461
00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:28.060
I don't know why
we're doing this.

462
00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:33.065
Oh. Jameson.
how are ya. buddy?

463
00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:36.235
It's been a long time.

464
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.069
What's up. Rich?

465
00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.195
I'm good. man.

466
00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:41.073
Probably not as good as
you as far as the intake

467
00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:43.075
of substances though.

468
00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:47.746
Touche. I have definitely
had an abundance of substances

469
00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:49.539
but very little this morning

470
00:20:49.539 --> 00:20:51.500
thanks to these
two little birdies.

471
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.794
Rich. come on. man. you're
being like a cliche right now.

472
00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:55.587
I said very little substances.

473
00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:58.757
so. I still don't know
what the fuck a cliche is.

474
00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:01.009
You. you're being
a cliche right now.

475
00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:02.135
That's what this means.

476
00:21:02.135 --> 00:21:03.262
This is cliche.

477
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:06.223
It's cliche.
- I think I can. ah.

478
00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:09.393
look. cliche is like when. um.

479
00:21:10.894 --> 00:21:13.063
You're just an addict
and an alcoholic. bro.

480
00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:14.940
There's nothing special
about this situation.

481
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.400
And an asshole.

482
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.736
I mean. even more of an asshole
with the substances. but.

483
00:21:19.736 --> 00:21:21.488
- That part.
- So.

484
00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.367
And what's so wrong with that?

485
00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:27.619
Nobody wants to be
around you anymore.

486
00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.371
You are a liability.

487
00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:32.666
You don't think about
anybody but yourself

488
00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:34.251
and it's disgusting.

489
00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:38.088
And honestly. you puke on your
shirt and sleep in it. gross.

490
00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:41.925
All right. good to know.

491
00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:47.222
I guess I've come to
the conclusion that
this is bullshit.

492
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.101
And. not only is it bullshit

493
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:54.938
but there seems to be some
sort of reality TV show

494
00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:56.148
in this apartment.

495
00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:57.649
What the fuck's up
with the camera?

496
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:59.776
I don't remember signing
on for anything like that.

497
00:21:59.776 --> 00:22:01.778
No. we're making the greatest
horror film of all time

498
00:22:01.778 --> 00:22:02.738
with you as the star.

499
00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:04.072
Kayla. go ahead.

500
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.117
Babe. do you remember
the camera last night

501
00:22:07.117 --> 00:22:08.243
that you saw in the car?

502
00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:09.953
Do you think he has?

503
00:22:09.953 --> 00:22:11.330
Obviously you don't remember.

504
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.832
But that's. we are
filming everything. babe.

505
00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:16.043
We are filming this
entire intervention.

506
00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.836
And I brought your best
friends along. so that-

507
00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:20.672
Oh. let. let's not
be too quick to use

508
00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:22.424
'best friend' for me. all right?

509
00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:24.301
- I too.
- Way too much commitment

510
00:22:24.301 --> 00:22:25.635
for Mr. Pissing the
trashcan over here.

511
00:22:25.635 --> 00:22:28.096
- Wait. what?
- This fool pissed

512
00:22:28.096 --> 00:22:30.891
in my boss' trashcan.
- Your boss' trashcan?

513
00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:32.809
- My boss' trashcan.
- You soiled public property?

514
00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:35.062
I told you already
that I was sorry.

515
00:22:35.896 --> 00:22:37.773
It was a mistake.

516
00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:41.026
I thought that Percocet
and Vicodin felt the same.

517
00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:43.445
so when I took them.
and I came into work.

518
00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:45.238
I was fucking zonked. man.

519
00:22:45.238 --> 00:22:48.200
Just let it. hey.
hey. let it go.

520
00:22:49.493 --> 00:22:51.119
- Let it go?
- Yeah.

521
00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:52.496
You want me to let it go?

522
00:22:54.331 --> 00:22:56.291
Okay. tell you what.

523
00:22:56.291 --> 00:22:57.918
I'll let it go.

524
00:22:57.918 --> 00:23:00.712
I'll let it go when you
apologize to my boss

525
00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:02.798
and the entire office.

526
00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:04.007
But. but you wouldn't do that.

527
00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:06.218
Na. you haven't
been back not once.

528
00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:08.011
Not to clean out your desk.

529
00:23:08.011 --> 00:23:09.763
not to pickup your
last paycheck.

530
00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:12.099
Not even to clean
up your own piss.

531
00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:13.558
You know who had to do that?

532
00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:16.019
Yeah. me.

533
00:23:17.437 --> 00:23:19.981
I had to clean up a grown
man's piss all 'cause he

534
00:23:19.981 --> 00:23:22.025
ain't got no goddamn restraint.

535
00:23:22.025 --> 00:23:24.611
I can't even look my
co-workers in they eyes.

536
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:27.989
I can't go a week without one
of them bringing your shit up.

537
00:23:27.989 --> 00:23:31.868
Yeah so. so. man. go fuck
yourself. right. Rich.

538
00:23:31.868 --> 00:23:32.828
I second that.

539
00:23:35.747 --> 00:23:37.582
Okay. I think. ah. what
Jameson is trying to say

540
00:23:37.582 --> 00:23:38.708
is-
- What is he trying to say.

541
00:23:38.708 --> 00:23:40.377
David?
- That we're all friends here.

542
00:23:40.377 --> 00:23:42.462
and we're all just
trying to support you.

543
00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:48.427
And honestly. man. if you
don't just pack up your things

544
00:23:49.886 --> 00:23:51.638
and come on this trip with us
like we have planned for you.

545
00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:54.141
then I don't know.

546
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:55.475
I don't know what
else to really say.

547
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:58.103
What trip?

548
00:23:58.979 --> 00:24:00.897
Kayla. what-
- Um.

549
00:24:00.897 --> 00:24:03.066
What trip is he talking about?

550
00:24:03.066 --> 00:24:04.651
Do you remember that
house that our dad

551
00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:06.570
bought up in the mountains?

552
00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:07.821
Well. we're gonna take you there

553
00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:10.198
and we're gonna be there
for you while you detox.

554
00:24:11.366 --> 00:24:14.077
- I'm not doing that.
- Yes. you are. Richard.

555
00:24:14.077 --> 00:24:14.911
Yes you are.

556
00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:18.248
Why would I go up there?

557
00:24:18.248 --> 00:24:20.250
I'm not. I'm not-

558
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.919
Look. babe. all I'm
saying is that you're coming

559
00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:25.672
on this trip right now because
I don't need you to have

560
00:24:25.672 --> 00:24:27.591
any cell reception.
do you understand?

561
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:30.093
I don't need you to have Wayne
in your fucking back pocket.

562
00:24:30.093 --> 00:24:31.928
I don't need you to be calling
any of your hangers-on.

563
00:24:31.928 --> 00:24:33.847
or your dealers. or
whatever the fuck.

564
00:24:33.847 --> 00:24:36.016
Because I want you sober.

565
00:24:36.016 --> 00:24:37.267
I need you sober.

566
00:24:38.101 --> 00:24:39.686
Because I can't do this anymore.

567
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:41.980
If you do not get help.

568
00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:46.443
I'm done.

569
00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:50.655
And I don't have to remind
you that this is my apartment.

570
00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:54.075
That means you'll be out on
the street. do you understand?

571
00:24:54.075 --> 00:24:55.410
That's where you're
most comfortable though.

572
00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.204
so it's honestly
a win-win for you.

573
00:25:04.211 --> 00:25:08.632
Well then I guess it's
off to the wilderness we go.

574
00:25:16.264 --> 00:25:19.100
- Let's do it.
- Let's pack the car. right?

575
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:19.935
Oh yeah.

576
00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:26.608
Wow. okay. so we're going.

577
00:25:26.608 --> 00:25:28.985
I kind of figured and hoped
that this would end here.

578
00:25:28.985 --> 00:25:31.279
but. good job. you did it.

579
00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:33.698
Right?

580
00:25:34.824 --> 00:25:35.659
Proud of you.

581
00:25:40.288 --> 00:25:43.041
Well. looks like we're
headed to the great outdoors.

582
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.501
I can think of
worse places to be.

583
00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:46.920
Mm-hm. yeah. you're not
much of a nature guy. are you?

584
00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:50.423
What. what. why you say that?

585
00:25:50.423 --> 00:25:53.468
I don't know.
where's this vest from?

586
00:25:53.468 --> 00:25:55.053
Bruh. no this ain't that. man.

587
00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:57.681
Look. when I step out.
I'm stepping out clean.

588
00:25:57.681 --> 00:25:58.974
That's how I operate. okay?

589
00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:00.392
So don't insult my vest.

590
00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:01.518
My vest is fine.

591
00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:02.852
You need to be
worried about yourself

592
00:26:02.852 --> 00:26:04.896
looking like a
hipster lumberjack

593
00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:06.690
just fell out of
Barnes and Nobles.

594
00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:07.899
I don't even know
what that means.

595
00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:11.194
But. ah. is this vest
even a camping vest.

596
00:26:11.194 --> 00:26:13.196
or is it just supposed to
look like a camping vest?

597
00:26:13.196 --> 00:26:14.155
Because-
- Look. man.

598
00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:15.615
I'm gonna be honest with you.

599
00:26:15.615 --> 00:26:17.492
Picked this vest up
about three weeks ago.

600
00:26:17.492 --> 00:26:19.578
There was this chick I was
trying to hook up with.

601
00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:20.870
- Okay.
- She like hiking.

602
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.707
so. you know. wanted
her to feel like

603
00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:25.458
I was a outdoorsy-type dude.

604
00:26:27.002 --> 00:26:28.587
Okay. well. she's a big fan
of hiking. clueless in nature.

605
00:26:28.587 --> 00:26:30.755
'cause this is definitely
more GQ than REI.

606
00:26:32.632 --> 00:26:37.637
Speaking of girls. ah. Dayna.
she's kind of cute. huh?

607
00:26:38.221 --> 00:26:39.472
I don't know.

608
00:26:39.472 --> 00:26:40.724
Why. what's up.
you interested?

609
00:26:40.724 --> 00:26:41.933
No. actually not
my type at all.

610
00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:43.184
But I think you
should go for it.

611
00:26:43.184 --> 00:26:45.228
Yeah. it kinda felt
like we was vibing. so.

612
00:26:45.228 --> 00:26:46.313
By all means.

613
00:26:47.355 --> 00:26:48.690
- Let me hold that.
- Oh. oh.

614
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.234
Cool. cool.

615
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.407
Yeah. so this is. oh-
- Oh.

616
00:26:57.407 --> 00:26:59.743
Here. let me help you.
- Pretty much the last of it.

617
00:26:59.743 --> 00:27:01.161
Where is David?

618
00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:02.412
I thought he was supposed
to be helping you?

619
00:27:02.412 --> 00:27:04.331
Ah. I think he went
back to go help Kayla

620
00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:06.916
motivate Richard.
- Right. the peace-making.

621
00:27:06.916 --> 00:27:08.376
God bless David.

622
00:27:08.376 --> 00:27:10.420
So what's up with all the
tents and sleeping bags.

623
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.921
I thought your dad
had a house up there?

624
00:27:11.921 --> 00:27:15.800
Yeah. yeah. it's more
like a 30-acre campground.

625
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.260
- Okay.
- It's actually

626
00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.888
pretty dilapidated but the main
house is in good condition.

627
00:27:19.888 --> 00:27:21.723
It's a little bit like Goldie
Locks and the three bears

628
00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:23.642
are getting ready to
have a tea party there.

629
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:24.768
Cozier than it sounds.

630
00:27:25.935 --> 00:27:29.606
Um. there are usually
caretakers there

631
00:27:29.606 --> 00:27:31.775
but my dad said something
about them quitting.

632
00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:32.692
I don't really know.

633
00:27:32.692 --> 00:27:34.319
He doesn't really listen.

634
00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:37.989
Um. I don't even know
if it has electricity.

635
00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:39.282
- Damn.
- But that poor bastard

636
00:27:39.282 --> 00:27:41.660
can sleep anywhere as
far as I'm concerned.

637
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.328
Maybe the bears'll get him.

638
00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:44.287
- Harsh.
- And he will be

639
00:27:44.287 --> 00:27:45.413
out of our lives forever.

640
00:27:45.413 --> 00:27:46.289
It's too harsh.

641
00:27:47.707 --> 00:27:50.126
Yeah. Kayla thought it
would be more therapeutic

642
00:27:50.126 --> 00:27:52.170
if we camped in back.

643
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.297
A more rustic setting
for the healing.

644
00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.802
But there are bears out there.

645
00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:01.429
I mean. I haven't seen them
when I've been up there

646
00:28:01.429 --> 00:28:02.972
but there are bears.
just so you know.

647
00:28:02.972 --> 00:28:05.308
I mean. if you get scared.

648
00:28:05.308 --> 00:28:07.644
I think the bears
ate the caretakers.

649
00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:09.145
Woo.

650
00:28:10.313 --> 00:28:11.314
I said
I'm coming. all right?

651
00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:15.985
All right. I'm gonna
get the rest of this.

that these are the
seating arrangements.

661
00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:23.720
Like. Kayla.

662
00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:27.766
I get car sick. I don't
know what to tell you.

663
00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:32.437
Babe. so you're telling
me. ah. we're going.

664
00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:35.231
we're going up to your. to
your dad's place. right?

665
00:29:35.231 --> 00:29:37.609
And there's not gonna be
any weed. alcohol. pills.

666
00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.110
nothing like that. so
I'm just gonna have

667
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.278
a shitty three days ahead of me?

668
00:29:41.237 --> 00:29:42.614
Just trying to figure that out.

669
00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:43.406
Bro. let me put
something into perspective

670
00:29:43.406 --> 00:29:44.616
for you right quick.

671
00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:47.452
Ah. you were recently
discovered. right?

672
00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:48.995
High outta your
gourd. all right?

673
00:29:48.995 --> 00:29:51.623
Passed out by a dumpster.
- True story.

674
00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.792
All right. you should at
least have a little bit of time.

675
00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:55.877
take a break for your detox
and your intervention.

676
00:29:55.877 --> 00:29:57.295
Chill out.
- I'm not saying

677
00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:59.088
that I can't. I've
already agreed to it.

678
00:29:59.088 --> 00:30:01.007
I was just trying to
make a final appeal.

679
00:30:01.007 --> 00:30:03.259
There is no
final appeal. Rich.

680
00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:04.761
We told you back
at the apartment.

681
00:30:04.761 --> 00:30:06.596
Kayla told you back
at the apartment.

682
00:30:06.596 --> 00:30:09.432
You either get clean or
it's the end of the line.

683
00:30:09.432 --> 00:30:11.267
Yeah. and it's
about fucking time.

684
00:30:12.268 --> 00:30:13.812
If you ask me.

685
00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:18.441
Dayna. if you could.
just for me. and um.

686
00:30:19.275 --> 00:30:20.610
just for me and the world.

687
00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:22.654
will you shut the fuck up?

688
00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:24.864
For five minutes
that would be great.

689
00:30:24.864 --> 00:30:27.033
Right back at you. asshole.

690
00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:27.992
- All right.
- I'm sorry.

691
00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:29.452
I can express my true feelings

692
00:30:29.452 --> 00:30:30.745
for five fucking minutes

693
00:30:30.745 --> 00:30:32.247
if he's gonna fucking
talk to me like this.

694
00:30:32.247 --> 00:30:32.956
I understand. but we don't
need to drive this way.

695
00:30:32.956 --> 00:30:34.207
like this. okay?

696
00:30:34.207 --> 00:30:35.583
Babe. you do not talk
to my sister like that.

697
00:30:35.583 --> 00:30:37.669
And Dayna. don't
perpetuate this.

698
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:38.962
Okay. we are trying to help him.

699
00:30:38.962 --> 00:30:40.547
Babe. you do have
a problem though.

700
00:30:40.547 --> 00:30:45.176
For you. we are here for you.
so watch the attitude. please.

701
00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:46.511
I wouldn't hold your breathe.

702
00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:47.971
I would not hold your breathe

703
00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:50.139
I cannot imagine a
universe in which Richard

704
00:30:50.139 --> 00:30:52.350
has a good attitude
about being sober.

705
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:53.852
Oh that's great. Jameson.

706
00:30:53.852 --> 00:30:57.856
Just talking shit. just
talking shit. that's just.

707
00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:59.315
that's just great.

708
00:30:59.315 --> 00:31:02.151
I really don't understand
because since the office thing.

709
00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:04.153
what could I have done to you?

710
00:31:04.153 --> 00:31:05.488
I don't know if
you've noticed. bro.

711
00:31:05.488 --> 00:31:07.782
but we ain't hung out
since the work incident.

712
00:31:07.782 --> 00:31:10.994
So yeah. no. you ain't had a
chance to screw me over again.

713
00:31:10.994 --> 00:31:12.245
But you would.

714
00:31:12.245 --> 00:31:13.705
I mean. you're just
not responsible. man.

715
00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:15.957
Okay. Rich. I know
you're coming off of stuff.

716
00:31:15.957 --> 00:31:17.625
I understand you're
uncomfortable.

717
00:31:17.625 --> 00:31:19.794
But you gotta throw us
a bone here. all right?

718
00:31:19.794 --> 00:31:22.255
Let's put a little
effort in. please?

719
00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:24.632
And. and. and we're all
up here for you. man.

720
00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:27.927
Let's just have a
better vibe. all right?

721
00:31:27.927 --> 00:31:30.221
Do you even have a
better vibe to switch to?

722
00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:33.349
I have a headache the
size of Mount Rushmore.

723
00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:37.228
Wait. is Mount Rushmore big?

724
00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:38.521
- Yes.
- Ah yeah.

725
00:31:38.521 --> 00:31:41.858
it's. Mount Rushmore is
big. it's a mountain.

726
00:31:41.858 --> 00:31:43.610
Okay. I thought
it might be small.

727
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.445
Smoked your brains
out all the way. man.

728
00:31:45.445 --> 00:31:46.946
You gotta chill. big dawg.

729
00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:53.286
Does anyone ever
ask the alcoholic.

730
00:31:53.286 --> 00:31:57.332
as you all labeled me. what
I think about all this?

731
00:31:57.332 --> 00:32:00.793
Because. I personally
like doing drugs.

732
00:32:00.793 --> 00:32:02.545
And. I'm not a big fan of life.

733
00:32:02.545 --> 00:32:03.713
Life sucks.

734
00:32:03.713 --> 00:32:06.758
No no no. your life sucks.

735
00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:07.967
Life don't suck.

736
00:32:07.967 --> 00:32:09.844
My life don't suck.
your life sucks.

737
00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:12.722
Yeah. you know what. Rich?

738
00:32:12.722 --> 00:32:15.558
I do think you. you know.
you're a good guy. all right?

739
00:32:15.558 --> 00:32:18.019
And I wanna see you do well.

740
00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:20.396
You made a lot of
mistakes. man. most of 'em

741
00:32:20.396 --> 00:32:23.149
are irreparable. but there's
a good guy inside of you.

742
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:24.984
I hope he comes out.

743
00:32:24.984 --> 00:32:25.902
You know
what. ah. Rich.

744
00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:28.029
maybe you should get some sleep.

745
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.863
I don't know.

746
00:32:28.863 --> 00:32:30.990
♪ Happy ending

747
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:35.995
♪ Let's be happy about

748
00:32:36.746 --> 00:32:38.331
♪ Just received this

749
00:32:38.331 --> 00:32:42.877
Hey. um. did you tell
Dad we were coming up here?

750
00:32:42.877 --> 00:32:44.629
Ah. yes. I did.

751
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:48.091
I called him yesterday.
- Oh. okay.

752
00:32:48.091 --> 00:32:50.468
Ah. did you tell him why
we were coming up here?

753
00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:53.054
Ah. yeah. I did.

754
00:32:53.054 --> 00:32:54.430
Hey-
- Wow. okay.

755
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:55.682
well. what did he say?

756
00:32:55.682 --> 00:32:57.600
I know he's never been
a big fan of Richard.

757
00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:02.605
- Okay. well-
- That's a surprise. honestly.

758
00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:03.606
Yeah. big shocker.

759
00:33:05.775 --> 00:33:08.361
He's not a fan. mostly
because of what Dayna

760
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:10.238
has told him. so.

761
00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:12.490
Oh. so you're gonna throw
the messenger under the bus?

762
00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.368
Babe. I can't sugarcoat facts.

763
00:33:17.286 --> 00:33:19.414
Oh hey. any of y'all
been to that restaurant

764
00:33:19.414 --> 00:33:20.623
off Vine and Melrose.

765
00:33:20.623 --> 00:33:22.625
like by where the old
Oinkster used to be?

766
00:33:23.793 --> 00:33:25.795
It's called Jameson.
- Oh yeah.

767
00:33:25.795 --> 00:33:28.631
They got the best pizza
fries. man. I'm telling you.

768
00:33:28.631 --> 00:33:30.383
- I'm sorry?
- Whoa. whoa. what?

769
00:33:30.383 --> 00:33:33.136
What did you say. pizza fries?

770
00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:35.513
They're like fries but
you get all the toppings

771
00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:37.432
from a pizza.
- Why?

772
00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:40.018
No. no. no. no. look.
look. look. don't do that.

773
00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:42.311
Look. look. and I had
the same first reaction

774
00:33:42.311 --> 00:33:43.646
as y'all did. okay?

775
00:33:43.646 --> 00:33:45.982
But when I sat down. saw
that on the menu. man.

776
00:33:45.982 --> 00:33:47.400
Look. I went to this place

777
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.152
'cause it's called
Jameson. right?

778
00:33:49.152 --> 00:33:51.904
I like to go to a
place where I feel.

779
00:33:51.904 --> 00:33:54.657
you know. already like
comfortable and welcome. right?

780
00:33:54.657 --> 00:33:57.827
What better way than by going
to a place called Jameson's?

781
00:33:57.827 --> 00:34:00.663
And my name is Jameson.
- Yeah we knew that.

782
00:34:00.663 --> 00:34:04.167
I don't know if that makes
any. I mean. I'm just trying

783
00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:05.626
to think of. I don't
know if I'd go to a place

784
00:34:05.626 --> 00:34:07.670
just called David's.
- Well. you don't know that.

785
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.839
now do you. David?
- I guess I don't.

786
00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:10.840
Yo. to each his own.

787
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.091
But anyway. let me tell you

788
00:34:12.091 --> 00:34:13.551
about these pizza
fries. all right?

789
00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:16.262
'Cause they were exceptional
and I will tell you why.

790
00:34:16.262 --> 00:34:17.680
I don't think we
need to know why.

791
00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.223
I'm gonna gag if you explain it.

792
00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:21.934
Yeah. well. I'm gonna tell
you anyway. okay. all right?

793
00:34:21.934 --> 00:34:23.019
'Cause this might
change your life.

794
00:34:23.019 --> 00:34:24.520
I'm just letting
you know. right?

795
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.397
I'm just trying
to wrap my head around this.

796
00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:27.857
I wouldn't
go to a restaurant

797
00:34:27.857 --> 00:34:29.025
called David's either.
- Like. who were you with?

798
00:34:29.025 --> 00:34:30.359
Yeah. who were you with?

799
00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.778
I was by myself.

800
00:34:31.778 --> 00:34:33.362
Oh ho. so this
was a little date?

801
00:34:33.362 --> 00:34:35.156
So wait. you went to
a place called Jameson's

802
00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:36.365
'cause your name is Jameson

803
00:34:36.365 --> 00:34:38.034
and you went by yourself?
- Yeah.

804
00:34:39.535 --> 00:34:41.287
When you say it like
that. I guess I do sound

805
00:34:41.287 --> 00:34:44.165
a little self indulgent.
- Not a little self indulgent.

806
00:34:44.165 --> 00:34:46.626
a lot self indulgent.
but I am here for it.

807
00:34:46.626 --> 00:34:48.127
Fair enough.

808
00:34:48.127 --> 00:34:49.337
Y'all gonna let me tell
you about the pizza fries.

809
00:34:49.337 --> 00:34:51.047
or what's up?
- Fine. go on.

810
00:34:51.047 --> 00:34:53.925
All right. so now. what
made these pizza fries

811
00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:57.136
like just delectable is like
the main thing is. look. look.

812
00:34:57.136 --> 00:34:58.721
you know it's a lot of different
type of fries out there.

813
00:34:58.721 --> 00:35:02.016
All right. you've got crinkle
cut. you got waffle fries.

814
00:35:02.016 --> 00:35:03.518
- Sure.
- Curly fries.

815
00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:04.894
- Right.
- No.

816
00:35:04.894 --> 00:35:06.979
- Steak fries.
- Steak fries.

817
00:35:06.979 --> 00:35:09.690
Mm. refresh me on
steak fries again.

818
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.652
Like. steak fries.
like a thicker cut.

819
00:35:12.652 --> 00:35:14.445
Like it's cut like a
steak. so they call 'em

820
00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:15.988
like steak fries.
- Not sure that's why

821
00:35:15.988 --> 00:35:18.282
it's called that. but.
- It's like a sturdy fry?

822
00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:19.492
Sturdy fry. right.

823
00:35:19.492 --> 00:35:21.077
So basically 'cause
they using these fries.

824
00:35:21.077 --> 00:35:24.163
it was like the
perfect combination
of this thick potato.

825
00:35:24.163 --> 00:35:26.999
man. and when it mix
with the pepperoni.

826
00:35:26.999 --> 00:35:29.210
the crispiness of the
pepperoni was amazing.

827
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:30.545
and the mozzarella.

828
00:35:31.921 --> 00:35:34.590
It'll change your life. it'll
really make you revaluate

829
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.551
like why I'm eating.
you know. what I eat?

830
00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:37.760
I gotta switch it
up a little bit.

831
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.971
I don't know how vegans do it.

832
00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:41.514
I put that little bit
of pepperoni on mine.

833
00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:44.767
I go to work. man. I'm telling
you. it'll change your life.

834
00:35:45.935 --> 00:35:47.353
I mean. I would try it.

835
00:35:47.353 --> 00:35:48.437
- David.
- Right.

836
00:35:48.437 --> 00:35:49.647
that's what I'm saying.

837
00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:51.440
Yeah. I mean. I'd
have to be drunk. but

838
00:35:52.567 --> 00:35:55.069
Sounds good.
- I was. I was drunk.

839
00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:57.530
Definitely drunk.

840
00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:01.450
- Cheeseburger.
- What'd you say. Ricky D?

841
00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.619
- What the fuck?
- Got the hangover mumble.

842
00:36:05.037 --> 00:36:05.872
Cheeseburger?

843
00:36:07.373 --> 00:36:08.958
This dude's
talking to himself.

844
00:36:08.958 --> 00:36:10.376
You said cheeseburger?

845
00:36:10.376 --> 00:36:12.336
That's. that's right. man.

846
00:36:23.806 --> 00:36:26.475
Ooh. all right.
- Here we are.

847
00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:33.733
Hey. why are we stopping here?

848
00:36:34.734 --> 00:36:36.235
I don't see a home.

849
00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:39.280
My dad was worried
about trespassers. so.

850
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.990
we gotta walk the
rest of the way.

851
00:36:42.491 --> 00:36:44.619
All right. well. ah. wanna
grab some bags. Jameson?

852
00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:45.786
Let's do it.

853
00:36:45.786 --> 00:36:48.706
I think Richard should
grab all the bags.

854
00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:50.208
Doesn't that seem fair?

855
00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:52.126
I'm already detoxing.
ah. from multiple things.

856
00:36:52.126 --> 00:36:53.669
- Oh right.
- Multiple things.

857
00:36:53.669 --> 00:36:55.922
I don't really feel like doing
any hard labor right now.

858
00:36:55.922 --> 00:36:59.425
Aw poor guy. took a bunch
of substances voluntarily

859
00:36:59.425 --> 00:37:00.968
and now he doesn't wanna
do any physical labor.

860
00:37:00.968 --> 00:37:02.595
Let's clean up
his mess again. huh?

861
00:37:02.595 --> 00:37:03.512
- Great.
- Okay.

862
00:37:03.512 --> 00:37:04.680
Fine. fine. hand me a bag.

863
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.932
Grab one of these bags.

864
00:37:05.932 --> 00:37:07.850
Oh. oops. oops. my bad. my bad.

865
00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:08.976
Can you pick that up?

866
00:37:08.976 --> 00:37:10.436
That's what happens to you.

867
00:37:10.436 --> 00:37:12.355
- I guess I can.
- When you are being a dick.

868
00:37:12.355 --> 00:37:13.522
Come on Rich.
you've got it man.

869
00:37:13.522 --> 00:37:15.149
That's real nice.

870
00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:21.280
This shit sucks as much as
I thought it was gonna suck.

871
00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:26.786
Really. I mean. wow.
nature. amazing.

872
00:37:26.786 --> 00:37:31.791
Ah. but. I have sobered
up a little bit.

873
00:37:32.959 --> 00:37:34.335
and I just wanted to
say that I'm sorry

874
00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:36.754
about what I said earlier.

875
00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:39.423
although I think all of this
is completely unnecessary.

876
00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:41.550
all of it.
- Actually. Richard.

877
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.552
I think this is the most
necessary thing you've ever done

878
00:37:43.552 --> 00:37:44.387
in your life.

879
00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.431
All right. point taken.

880
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:48.641
I guess I'll just
shut the fuck up.

881
00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:50.142
- Please.
- I've been trying to say that

882
00:37:50.142 --> 00:37:51.602
to ya this whole trip. but
I couldn't figure out a way

883
00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:53.187
to make it sound polite.
- You can't be in a bad mood

884
00:37:53.187 --> 00:37:55.273
out here.
- Yes I can.

885
00:37:56.565 --> 00:37:57.400
Easily!

886
00:37:58.567 --> 00:38:00.653
And I'm trying to
have a good time.

887
00:38:00.653 --> 00:38:01.988
David?

888
00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:03.572
You gotta admit this shit sucks.

889
00:38:03.572 --> 00:38:06.242
I mean. I'm already starting
to get the shakes over here.

890
00:38:06.242 --> 00:38:07.702
What are. what are. what
are the fucking shakes?

891
00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:09.537
I don't know. they happen
after I drink a bunch.

892
00:38:09.537 --> 00:38:10.746
and then if I take a day off.

893
00:38:10.746 --> 00:38:12.081
all of a sudden
I get the shakes.

894
00:38:12.081 --> 00:38:14.000
It's called detoxing.

895
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.960
Dude. detoxing only
happens with drugs.

896
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.588
- Alcohol is a drug. man.
- Alcohol is not a drug.

897
00:38:19.588 --> 00:38:21.048
It's been around forever.

898
00:38:21.048 --> 00:38:23.634
Yeah. so has
weed but it's still a drug.

899
00:38:25.094 --> 00:38:28.139
So you're trying to tell
me that weed and alcohol

900
00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.932
are the same as
cocaine and ecstasy?

901
00:38:29.932 --> 00:38:31.767
No. no. you idiot.

902
00:38:31.767 --> 00:38:33.436
They're just saying they're
both classified as drugs.

903
00:38:33.436 --> 00:38:34.937
please don't do them
again. let's go!

904
00:38:34.937 --> 00:38:37.732
All right. let's
just. leave him alone.

905
00:38:37.732 --> 00:38:39.483
This is already kind of
a fucked up situation.

906
00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:40.943
It was fucked up
before we got here.

907
00:38:40.943 --> 00:38:43.195
You're actually just
keeping it continuous. so.

908
00:38:45.614 --> 00:38:46.449
I get it.

909
00:38:49.535 --> 00:38:50.953
I'm sorry.

910
00:38:50.953 --> 00:38:52.455
I am sorry. I'm.

911
00:38:53.914 --> 00:38:58.711
I will say. I didn't really
realize till earlier today

912
00:38:58.711 --> 00:39:03.174
that. um. I didn't realize
that I was affecting your life

913
00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:07.678
as much as Kayla's
until earlier today.

914
00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:09.096
All right?

915
00:39:09.096 --> 00:39:12.641
I didn't. I. I always justified
Kayla because. you know.

916
00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:15.644
she's affected by me. but she
knew what she signed up for

917
00:39:15.644 --> 00:39:18.564
when she was with me.
- Yeah. yeah she knew.

918
00:39:19.398 --> 00:39:20.316
She knew.

919
00:39:21.817 --> 00:39:23.903
She understood that you were
going through a rough patch.

920
00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:25.279
I don't think she thought
it was gonna go on

921
00:39:25.279 --> 00:39:26.155
and on and on.

922
00:39:28.282 --> 00:39:29.909
There's no end in sight.

923
00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:33.079
All right. this
is. this is okay.

924
00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:34.997
This is okay. Rich.
we're good. right?

925
00:39:38.334 --> 00:39:39.543
I mean he's here.

926
00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:41.462
So let's not be so hard
on him anymore. okay?

927
00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:44.465
Let's just keep going.

928
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.760
That's fine.

929
00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.719
You okay.

930
00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:49.970
do you want some water?
- No.

931
00:39:55.518 --> 00:39:58.312
Okay. so y'all
really were (indistinct).

932
00:39:58.312 --> 00:39:59.605
I missed
it so much up here.

933
00:39:59.605 --> 00:40:01.816
Haven't you. Kayla?

934
00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:05.111
Kayla. how much
farther along do we have to go?

935
00:40:06.445 --> 00:40:09.949
- Quit complaining.
- I'm (sighs). stop filming.

936
00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:11.909
You gotta sweat
out the alcohol. man. come on.

937
00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:14.912
Well. I took mushrooms and
I thought I was in nature.

938
00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:17.540
Okay. well. maybe we'll just
pretend you're on mushrooms

939
00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.041
I don't know.

940
00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:21.752
Doesn't this. don't these woods
kind of remind you of that.

941
00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:23.504
I forget the name of it.
horror movie we watched

942
00:40:23.504 --> 00:40:25.172
that one night. remember that?

943
00:40:25.172 --> 00:40:26.132
We should do
another movie night.

944
00:40:26.132 --> 00:40:27.383
What. "Blood Mother?"

945
00:40:27.383 --> 00:40:28.592
That one?
- Yeah. yeah.

946
00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:30.052
that was it. right?
- Yeah. okay.

947
00:40:30.052 --> 00:40:31.303
Doesn't it look
exactly like those woods?

948
00:40:31.303 --> 00:40:32.888
It does but I can
just watch it at home

949
00:40:32.888 --> 00:40:34.682
and I could be high
while it happens.

950
00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:36.934
- Come on!
- What?

951
00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:38.144
We high in
altitude. all right?

952
00:40:38.144 --> 00:40:39.353
- Yeah. yeah.
- That's your high.

953
00:40:39.353 --> 00:40:40.938
- There we go.
- High in altitude?

954
00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:41.856
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

955
00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:44.650
Are we close to
the house. or what?

956
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.569
- Yeah.
- Are we close. 'cause.

957
00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:48.696
Do you
need a little break?

958
00:40:48.696 --> 00:40:50.197
- I would like-
- Wanna sit down?

959
00:40:50.197 --> 00:40:51.907
I would like a break.
yeah. that would be good.

960
00:40:51.907 --> 00:40:53.826
- Did anybody bring?
- What?

961
00:40:53.826 --> 00:40:56.871
- You know.
- Oxygen?

962
00:40:58.038 --> 00:40:58.956
Do you
need a little oxygen?

963
00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.207
Should we bother a park ranger?

964
00:41:00.207 --> 00:41:01.125
Remember when we had to
call that park ranger.

965
00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.252
We shouldn't unpack our stuff.

966
00:41:03.252 --> 00:41:04.420
He can make
it. he can make it.

967
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.588
Yeah. let's not unpack
right now. come on.

968
00:41:05.588 --> 00:41:06.505
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

969
00:41:06.505 --> 00:41:07.756
Here. you want. I'll even take-

970
00:41:07.756 --> 00:41:09.216
If I don't have to
hear anymore banter.

971
00:41:09.216 --> 00:41:11.760
The only thing I'm grateful
for right now is you.

972
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.304
- Good.
- But not this.

973
00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:14.722
Not. not. the intervention.

974
00:41:14.722 --> 00:41:15.848
I really was just.

975
00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:19.560
I just can't get over
how beautiful it is.

976
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.520
Okay. ooh.
she making a tape.

977
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.771
What you doing?

978
00:41:22.771 --> 00:41:23.981
Ooh. get me. get
my good side. ooh.

979
00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.274
What I'm looking like. ooh.

980
00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:26.484
Get me with her one time.

981
00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:29.069
Oh fuh. thank God.
the fucking house.

982
00:41:30.529 --> 00:41:33.115
Ah.
ooh. yeah. we in there.

983
00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:35.743
I like it.

984
00:41:35.743 --> 00:41:36.911
Sis. you're
killing those pants.

985
00:41:36.911 --> 00:41:38.078
I do love those.

986
00:41:38.078 --> 00:41:39.288
Oh my gosh. thank you.

987
00:41:39.288 --> 00:41:40.748
- Ooh.
- Thank you for letting me

988
00:41:40.748 --> 00:41:43.542
borrow them.
- Oh God. okay.

989
00:41:43.542 --> 00:41:44.627
This won't be so bad.

990
00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.087
Ah. what won't be bad?

991
00:41:47.087 --> 00:41:48.464
Staying in the house?

992
00:41:48.464 --> 00:41:49.715
'Cause we're not.

993
00:41:49.715 --> 00:41:51.258
We're staying back
there behind it.

994
00:41:51.258 --> 00:41:53.844
- Why?
- Well. it does look like

995
00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.804
the caretakers quit
a few weeks ago.

996
00:41:55.804 --> 00:41:58.098
And the electricity
looks completely off.

997
00:41:58.098 --> 00:42:00.100
and you don't deserve it.

998
00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.811
Nice. so. actual
camping. like in tents.

999
00:42:02.811 --> 00:42:04.980
Ah. come on. an air
mattress in a tent

1000
00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.067
is gonna beat the hell out
of an alley way. right?

1001
00:42:08.067 --> 00:42:11.278
We don't know that. we
can't say definitively.

1002
00:42:11.278 --> 00:42:12.530
It'll be fine. babe.

1003
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.989
I'm just gonna go run
in and get some stuff.

1004
00:42:13.989 --> 00:42:16.033
But if you guys wanna start
setting up. it's literally just

1005
00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:16.951
right behind the deck.

1006
00:42:16.951 --> 00:42:18.077
And I'll be right back.

1007
00:42:18.077 --> 00:42:19.078
- You good?
- Yeah!

1008
00:42:26.085 --> 00:42:28.003
So this is camping?

1009
00:42:28.003 --> 00:42:29.755
That's. that's great.

1010
00:42:32.258 --> 00:42:33.300
People do this?

1011
00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:39.348
Yes. Richard. people do this
and they seem to enjoy it.

1012
00:42:40.975 --> 00:42:42.393
Come on. man.

1013
00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:44.687
This has gotta be better
than giving blow jobs

1014
00:42:44.687 --> 00:42:47.690
to the local biker gang for
vodka in a dark alley. right?

1015
00:42:49.149 --> 00:42:50.568
I'm sorry. bro. I had to.

1016
00:42:52.945 --> 00:42:54.697
Jameson. are you
always like this

1017
00:42:54.697 --> 00:42:57.825
or is it just 'cause
this jackass is around
to motivate you?

1018
00:42:58.867 --> 00:43:01.287
Aw. man. I. I
actually consider myself

1019
00:43:01.287 --> 00:43:03.998
a pretty like angry guy.

1020
00:43:03.998 --> 00:43:07.251
Humor allows me to kinda like
hedge my initial response

1021
00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:09.461
so I don't. you know.
blow up at people. so.

1022
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:12.131
Kayla. you think
I should try that?

1023
00:43:12.131 --> 00:43:13.549
Yes. please.

1024
00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:18.387
Well. I don't know. I
haven't always been like this.

1025
00:43:21.807 --> 00:43:25.728
I. I guess like after
my little brother died.

1026
00:43:25.728 --> 00:43:30.316
I. ah. I just got
like real angry.

1027
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.234
So.

1028
00:43:33.569 --> 00:43:35.571
I'm sorry.

1029
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:37.364
Ah yeah. it's all good.

1030
00:43:39.408 --> 00:43:44.413
But yeah. man. my. ah.
my little brother. ah.

1031
00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:46.915
died in a car accident.

1032
00:43:46.915 --> 00:43:48.000
He wasn't even driving.

1033
00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:50.085
What happened to him?

1034
00:43:50.085 --> 00:43:52.379
Was it drunk driving. or?

1035
00:43:52.379 --> 00:43:54.715
- Nah.
- Just one of those things?

1036
00:43:54.715 --> 00:43:56.258
If a 90-year-old woman

1037
00:43:56.258 --> 00:43:59.345
plowing through a fucking red
light and hitting another car

1038
00:43:59.345 --> 00:44:00.763
when she shouldn't even
been fucking driving

1039
00:44:00.763 --> 00:44:05.309
is just one of those things.
then. eh. I guess so.

1040
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:06.769
I ah. I didn't know. man.

1041
00:44:06.769 --> 00:44:09.605
I wasn't. I wasn't trying
to discount anything.

1042
00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:14.860
But no harm. no foul. right?

1043
00:44:16.278 --> 00:44:19.114
My little brother.
he was the good one.

1044
00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.289
Ronnie was the best. man.

1045
00:44:27.289 --> 00:44:30.292
Like straight-A student.

1046
00:44:30.292 --> 00:44:32.961
Never touched drugs.
alcohol. none of that.

1047
00:44:34.129 --> 00:44:36.965
He was an Eagle Scout.
straight As. man.

1048
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:40.636
He volunteered for
this local organization

1049
00:44:40.636 --> 00:44:44.723
that. ah. helped homeless teens.

1050
00:44:44.723 --> 00:44:47.810
And. ah.
- Doesn't make you

1051
00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.061
a worse person or better

1052
00:44:49.061 --> 00:44:51.271
just because you wanted
to live your life

1053
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:52.981
the way you wanted to.

1054
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:56.652
You know my therapist.
on multiple occasions.

1055
00:44:56.652 --> 00:44:58.862
she told me the same
exact thing. man.

1056
00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.701
But I still can't bring
myself to believe it.

1057
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:08.205
When my little brother died.

1058
00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:13.001
I honestly feel like
it was a mistake. man.

1059
00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:16.839
God doesn't make mistakes.

1060
00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:18.590
Eh oh. well. if God
didn't make a mistake

1061
00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.802
then somebody else
fucking did 'cause Ronnie

1062
00:45:21.802 --> 00:45:23.095
should still be here. man.

1063
00:45:25.264 --> 00:45:28.767
So yeah. that's. ah.
that's why I use humor.

1064
00:45:28.767 --> 00:45:33.355
'cause like. ah. trying
to think about life

1065
00:45:35.441 --> 00:45:36.692
and just how fragile it is.

1066
00:45:36.692 --> 00:45:41.155
it's like. it's just
too much. man. so.

1067
00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:45.993
I am sorry.

1068
00:45:49.037 --> 00:45:51.623
I. I. ah. didn't know
that. Jameson. so.

1069
00:45:52.791 --> 00:45:56.253
Yeah. me too. Rich.

1070
00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:02.259
But shit. man. I didn't come
here to put like a damper

1071
00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:04.720
on the whole journey
through the wilderness

1072
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.890
with our good brother
Rich here. so. ah.

1073
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:09.391
enough about me.

1074
00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:10.225
All right.

1075
00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:19.735
Is. ah. is that why you
treat me the way you do?

1076
00:46:22.571 --> 00:46:25.240
'Cause maybe your brother
should be here instead of me?

1077
00:46:36.752 --> 00:46:38.587
You know what. Rich?

1078
00:46:39.713 --> 00:46:40.756
You must be sober

1079
00:46:43.926 --> 00:46:45.260
'cause that's the most clarity

1080
00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.721
I've heard from you
since back before

1081
00:46:47.721 --> 00:46:49.223
the work incident. right?

1082
00:46:51.433 --> 00:46:52.267
And yeah. man.

1083
00:46:53.727 --> 00:46:56.772
I. you know. I think there is
a little bit of resentment.

1084
00:46:56.772 --> 00:46:58.982
I just don't get why people

1085
00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:01.276
that piss their
life away. right?

1086
00:47:01.276 --> 00:47:05.030
Just get to keep pissing it
away when people who deserve

1087
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.199
to be here. aren't. right?

1088
00:47:07.199 --> 00:47:09.159
And that made me question God.

1089
00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:10.953
So bro. you know.
I'm angry at you

1090
00:47:10.953 --> 00:47:13.497
but it ain't got nothing
to do with the work. bro.

1091
00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:15.958
It's 'cause you made
me question God.

1092
00:47:15.958 --> 00:47:18.961
And your screw-up after
screw-up after screw-up

1093
00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:22.256
of a life is just another
drop in the bucket

1094
00:47:22.256 --> 00:47:24.967
of my evidence that
fucking God don't exist.

1095
00:47:26.802 --> 00:47:29.346
Jameson. you don't have
to keep talking about it.

1096
00:47:30.931 --> 00:47:33.433
Look. I'm not gonna
make an excuse.

1097
00:47:33.433 --> 00:47:35.561
but he's an alcoholic
and a drug addict.

1098
00:47:36.812 --> 00:47:38.564
And it's a disease.

1099
00:47:38.564 --> 00:47:41.483
This. eh. I'm gonna just
have to take your word

1100
00:47:41.483 --> 00:47:45.153
on that whole disease
shit. all right?

1101
00:47:45.153 --> 00:47:47.990
Cancer is a disease.

1102
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:50.659
Mesothelioma is
a damned disease.

1103
00:47:50.659 --> 00:47:52.828
This motherfucker
just a lazy shit.

1104
00:47:52.828 --> 00:47:55.372
- I second that.
- I. I hear you. man.

1105
00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:59.835
but I. I. if that's the
case. then a lot of people

1106
00:47:59.835 --> 00:48:02.880
who are fucked up. they
would just stop drinking.

1107
00:48:04.256 --> 00:48:07.885
They wouldn't need a
12-step program or rehab.

1108
00:48:09.261 --> 00:48:11.972
Your disease is curable
and the cure is like

1109
00:48:11.972 --> 00:48:13.348
two miles from your
apartment. man.

1110
00:48:13.348 --> 00:48:16.059
I. I agree with
what he's saying.

1111
00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:19.688
It's. think about all those
stories we read all the time

1112
00:48:19.688 --> 00:48:23.567
about our friends or celebrities
OD-ing. and they die.

1113
00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:25.235
It's. there's something.
it's not random.

1114
00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:26.361
there's something in their head.

1115
00:48:26.361 --> 00:48:27.571
- Because they choose.
- No. it's.

1116
00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:29.489
it's more than that.
it's not their fault.

1117
00:48:29.489 --> 00:48:33.201
It's not their fault because
they chose to stay sick.

1118
00:48:33.201 --> 00:48:36.997
People with cancer don't
choose to stay sick?

1119
00:48:36.997 --> 00:48:38.790
I just wanted
the voices to stop.

1120
00:48:40.167 --> 00:48:43.211
What?

1121
00:48:43.211 --> 00:48:44.546
What voices. Rich?

1122
00:48:48.675 --> 00:48:49.718
The voices.

1123
00:48:50.886 --> 00:48:53.055
The ones that say
you're not good enough.

1124
00:48:53.055 --> 00:48:55.265
and you're never gonna be good
enough. and that life sucks.

1125
00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:56.558
and it's always gonna suck.

1126
00:48:56.558 --> 00:48:58.268
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

1127
00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:08.779
When I drink though. you know.
when I smoke. snort. pop.

1128
00:49:12.908 --> 00:49:14.409
I finally feel okay.

1129
00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:19.915
And that's all I've ever
wanted. was to feel okay.

1130
00:49:25.337 --> 00:49:26.254
It will be okay.

1131
00:49:28.548 --> 00:49:32.302
So. you know. who wants food?

1132
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.013
Well. yeah. we
should eat something.

1133
00:49:35.013 --> 00:49:35.847
Yeah.

1134
00:49:45.607 --> 00:49:47.401
Hey. Rich. can
we talk real quick?

1135
00:49:56.284 --> 00:49:58.412
So you said something
earlier. um.

1136
00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:00.956
about how you've been feeling

1137
00:50:00.956 --> 00:50:05.961
and how you wanted
to stop the voices.

1138
00:50:09.756 --> 00:50:10.590
Remember my dad?

1139
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.634
Yeah.

1140
00:50:14.386 --> 00:50:15.220
He's a funny guy.

1141
00:50:17.597 --> 00:50:20.308
He started having
problems after I left home.

1142
00:50:22.811 --> 00:50:27.816
I try not to think about
it very much but when I do.

1143
00:50:28.984 --> 00:50:31.862
I realize he sounded
a lot like you.

1144
00:50:34.239 --> 00:50:37.159
He was looking for
distractions. ya know?

1145
00:50:37.159 --> 00:50:39.828
Whether he was home. at work.

1146
00:50:41.955 --> 00:50:43.206
he had these voices.

1147
00:50:45.167 --> 00:50:48.920
He said they would tell
him he wasn't worth it.

1148
00:50:50.422 --> 00:50:51.715
That nothing was worth it.

1149
00:50:53.467 --> 00:50:55.594
And he was just trying
to silence them too.

1150
00:51:01.141 --> 00:51:02.350
Does he drink like me?

1151
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.396
He didn't drink.

1152
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:09.608
Didn't?

1153
00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:14.279
He killed himself.

1154
00:51:16.364 --> 00:51:19.868
He didn't drink.
he didn't do drugs.

1155
00:51:19.868 --> 00:51:24.873
he was just. ah. looking for
a way to silence the voices.

1156
00:51:27.042 --> 00:51:31.338
And I think he was just
looking until he found a way.

1157
00:51:34.716 --> 00:51:36.468
I'm not trying to kill myself.

1158
00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:41.765
You drink more than
anyone I've ever seen. man.

1159
00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:45.227
You do excessive amounts of
any drug that's handed to you.

1160
00:51:45.227 --> 00:51:49.231
so. so if you're not
looking for death

1161
00:51:49.231 --> 00:51:50.732
then I don't know what the
hell you're looking for. man.

1162
00:51:50.732 --> 00:51:52.984
Because that's the
only possible thing

1163
00:51:52.984 --> 00:51:56.738
that you're gonna find
in every dark alley

1164
00:51:58.115 --> 00:51:59.491
or hole that you crawl in.

1165
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.039
I guess I. I think
it would be okay

1166
00:52:07.541 --> 00:52:09.000
if I wasn't here anymore.

1167
00:52:10.752 --> 00:52:14.381
I think then maybe
Kayla could find someone

1168
00:52:14.381 --> 00:52:17.717
who wasn't an idiot.
and then my friends

1169
00:52:17.717 --> 00:52:19.761
wouldn't have to deal
with my bullshit. ya know?

1170
00:52:19.761 --> 00:52:21.471
You're wrong. Rich.

1171
00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:22.305
You're wrong.

1172
00:52:24.391 --> 00:52:27.561
We're here because we love
you. because you are worth it.

1173
00:52:29.104 --> 00:52:32.524
And. I didn't get to
say that to my dad.

1174
00:52:37.362 --> 00:52:38.947
But I sure as hell can tell you.

1175
00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:43.910
I'm not gonna watch
you kill yourself.

1176
00:52:47.247 --> 00:52:48.039
I can't.

1177
00:52:52.335 --> 00:52:53.837
- Howdy.
- Whoa. what the?

1178
00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:57.757
What the hell?

1179
00:52:57.757 --> 00:52:59.968
Hey. ah. hi. who are you?

1180
00:53:01.303 --> 00:53:02.637
I'm sorry. this is
private property. man.

1181
00:53:02.637 --> 00:53:03.597
you're trespassing.

1182
00:53:05.056 --> 00:53:06.725
Well. I don't really
believe that anyone

1183
00:53:06.725 --> 00:53:08.226
can own a piece of the Earth.

1184
00:53:09.394 --> 00:53:10.562
Especially not a
piece of the Earth

1185
00:53:10.562 --> 00:53:12.063
that the Father has created.

1186
00:53:12.063 --> 00:53:14.065
I mean. really. we're all
just stewards of the planet

1187
00:53:14.065 --> 00:53:15.150
till he calls us home.

1188
00:53:17.235 --> 00:53:19.404
I appreciate you have
that perspective. right?

1189
00:53:19.404 --> 00:53:21.281
Ah. what the hell
are you doing here?

1190
00:53:22.824 --> 00:53:23.909
My name is Eli.

1191
00:53:24.951 --> 00:53:26.369
And I am on a pilgrimage.

1192
00:53:28.079 --> 00:53:30.332
I'm. I'm just so
happy to see you all.

1193
00:53:31.791 --> 00:53:34.044
I haven't seen anybody in days.

1194
00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:36.713
And. well. now I know
why the Father led me

1195
00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.548
into the wilderness. it
was so that I could meet

1196
00:53:38.548 --> 00:53:40.425
you beautiful people.

1197
00:53:43.345 --> 00:53:45.138
Uh. how many days you
said you'd been out here?

1198
00:53:45.138 --> 00:53:47.474
- Two or three.
- Have you eaten?

1199
00:53:48.683 --> 00:53:52.103
- Kayla. stranger danger?
- I agree.

1200
00:53:52.103 --> 00:53:54.397
Dude. it's okay. I mean.
look at him. he's hurt.

1201
00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:55.482
- Who cares?
- Stop.

1202
00:53:57.275 --> 00:53:58.193
I'm so sorry about that.

1203
00:53:58.193 --> 00:53:59.527
What happened to your hand?

1204
00:54:01.863 --> 00:54:06.868
Oh this. it's just a
mishap with a tree branch.

1205
00:54:06.868 --> 00:54:08.203
It's nothing serious.

1206
00:54:09.537 --> 00:54:11.289
I'm all right.

1207
00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:15.377
And I assure you that I am
of no harm to any of y'all.

1208
00:54:15.377 --> 00:54:16.628
Well. we just finished eating.

1209
00:54:16.628 --> 00:54:19.005
so I'm gonna get
you a plate. okay?

1210
00:54:19.005 --> 00:54:19.798
Get your girl.

1211
00:54:24.344 --> 00:54:25.262
Eli was it?

1212
00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:27.389
Um. you mentioned a pilgrimage.

1213
00:54:27.389 --> 00:54:30.308
Is. is that why you're here?
- Yes.

1214
00:54:31.851 --> 00:54:32.686
Bless you.

1215
00:54:33.853 --> 00:54:37.399
I was. I was. I was
lost. I'd lost my way.

1216
00:54:40.402 --> 00:54:41.611
And then I felt the Father.

1217
00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:44.781
and the Father led me
into the wilderness

1218
00:54:44.781 --> 00:54:46.741
so that I could find my purpose.

1219
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:50.078
Let me get this straight.

1220
00:54:50.078 --> 00:54:54.582
Ah. so you wandered out
into the wilderness.

1221
00:54:54.582 --> 00:54:57.252
Did. did the Father like
give you GPS directions.

1222
00:54:57.252 --> 00:55:00.922
or some shit. like?
- And Yahweh said to Abraham

1223
00:55:00.922 --> 00:55:04.050
leave your home. your
country. your kinsmen.

1224
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:07.178
and your father's home and
I will show you a new land.

1225
00:55:08.596 --> 00:55:11.266
Okay. gotcha (chuckles).

1226
00:55:12.934 --> 00:55:15.228
We've got a space cadet
on our hands right here.

1227
00:55:17.022 --> 00:55:19.232
You said something
about being lost.

1228
00:55:19.232 --> 00:55:20.525
I had no purpose.

1229
00:55:21.901 --> 00:55:25.905
I was adrift. I was a
lonely. desolate soul.

1230
00:55:27.032 --> 00:55:29.951
And I did whatever I
could to fulfill myself.

1231
00:55:29.951 --> 00:55:33.997
Alcohol. drugs. sex.

1232
00:55:36.082 --> 00:55:38.084
But none of it brought
me what I needed.

1233
00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:41.838
And then I found the Father.

1234
00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:45.133
And the Father loved me.

1235
00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:47.052
The Father needed me.

1236
00:55:48.261 --> 00:55:49.971
And the Father
showed me my purpose.

1237
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:52.724
And it's you.

1238
00:55:55.268 --> 00:55:56.644
You are my purpose.

1239
00:55:59.773 --> 00:56:01.274
Well. damn. Rich.

1240
00:56:01.274 --> 00:56:03.068
We had this whole
intervention. all you needed

1241
00:56:03.068 --> 00:56:04.903
was the Father the
whole damn time.

1242
00:56:11.284 --> 00:56:12.786
You're very funny. my friend.

1243
00:56:15.663 --> 00:56:19.542
But you use your humor to
mask your anger and your hurt.

1244
00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:22.796
What did you just say to me?

1245
00:56:22.796 --> 00:56:24.631
You've. you've been watching us?

1246
00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:26.174
He been. how long have
you been watching us?

1247
00:56:26.174 --> 00:56:28.176
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.
- Okay. come on.

1248
00:56:28.176 --> 00:56:29.677
I have no need to watch.

1249
00:56:31.304 --> 00:56:33.098
The Father shows me
what I need to see.

1250
00:56:33.098 --> 00:56:35.475
And leads me to
where I need to be.

1251
00:56:36.976 --> 00:56:40.855
Only the spotless
sheep. free of blemish

1252
00:56:40.855 --> 00:56:42.273
ever get to meet the Father.

1253
00:56:44.984 --> 00:56:45.819
Now tell me.

1254
00:56:48.696 --> 00:56:49.697
Are you white as snow?

1255
00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:52.826
That some kinda
racist bullshit.

1256
00:56:54.327 --> 00:56:56.663
The Father gonna lead you
to get your ass beat. boy.

1257
00:56:59.707 --> 00:57:00.542
What's up?

1258
00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:04.587
I meant no offense. my friend.

1259
00:57:04.587 --> 00:57:06.089
Not your friend.

1260
00:57:07.882 --> 00:57:10.552
Those who will not listen
and receive thy greeting.

1261
00:57:10.552 --> 00:57:12.720
leave them and shake
the dust off your feet.

1262
00:57:14.848 --> 00:57:17.100
Judgment is swift my friend.

1263
00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:22.397
Cleanse thyself.
less ye be cleansed.

1264
00:57:32.073 --> 00:57:34.951
Okay. so. who wants s'mores?

1265
00:57:34.951 --> 00:57:36.911
Or. who wants to
pack everything up

1266
00:57:36.911 --> 00:57:38.455
and get the fuck outta
here as soon as possible?

1267
00:57:38.455 --> 00:57:40.165
Yo. if he comes back here.

1268
00:57:40.165 --> 00:57:41.916
I'm gonna fucking
murder him. okay.

1269
00:57:43.042 --> 00:57:43.710
- Jameson.
- He better not show

1270
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:44.836
his face. man.

1271
00:57:44.836 --> 00:57:46.296
- Jameson.
- I ain't playing.

1272
00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:47.964
If you stay at this anger.
I'm sure it'll be fine.

1273
00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:49.924
Yo. it's your fault
that we even up here

1274
00:57:49.924 --> 00:57:51.468
in the first place. so
shut your mouth. all right?

1275
00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:52.760
All right. dude. he's
joking. it's a joke.

1276
00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.512
What he said about me
wasn't no fucking joke.

1277
00:57:54.512 --> 00:57:55.930
This whole shit ain't funny.

1278
00:57:57.307 --> 00:58:00.226
Jameson. chill.
chill. let's go.

1279
00:58:00.226 --> 00:58:01.352
Y'all tripping.

1280
00:58:01.352 --> 00:58:02.270
All y'all tripping.

1281
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:03.104
Go.

1282
00:58:05.106 --> 00:58:08.193
- Is he still out there?
- I hope not.

1283
00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:14.949
Take him on a
walk. please. fuck.

1284
00:58:17.952 --> 00:58:21.080
That is not how I imagined
the start of this trip going.

1285
00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:24.042
Thought it was going okay.

1286
00:58:24.042 --> 00:58:26.586
Till the psycho in the
ripped poncho showed up.

1287
00:58:29.297 --> 00:58:31.883
Richard. is anything
anyone is saying

1288
00:58:31.883 --> 00:58:33.009
getting through to you?

1289
00:58:36.763 --> 00:58:40.475
Yeah. as much as it
can right now. I guess.

1290
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:43.186
But what does that even mean?

1291
00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:45.188
It's either getting
through to you or it's not.

1292
00:58:49.484 --> 00:58:52.403
I don't know what
you want me to say.

1293
00:58:52.403 --> 00:58:56.449
I know that my actions have
. have hurt you

1294
00:58:56.449 --> 00:58:57.742
and everyone else.

1295
00:58:59.744 --> 00:59:03.540
And all my bullshit has affected
everyone. and that sucks.

1296
00:59:05.959 --> 00:59:07.585
'Cause up until
this point. I've.

1297
00:59:09.337 --> 00:59:10.505
I've just ignored it.

1298
00:59:11.506 --> 00:59:12.340
Right.

1299
00:59:13.508 --> 00:59:14.676
Okay. well. that's
good. I mean it's good

1300
00:59:14.676 --> 00:59:16.261
that you're aware of that now.

1301
00:59:21.516 --> 00:59:25.353
Kayla. I. for what it's worth.

1302
00:59:27.355 --> 00:59:28.356
I am sorry.

1303
00:59:31.526 --> 00:59:34.529
I know I haven't been
sober long enough to have

1304
00:59:34.529 --> 00:59:35.863
a coherent conversation.

1305
00:59:38.199 --> 00:59:39.867
And I can't promise
what's gonna happen.

1306
00:59:39.867 --> 00:59:43.705
but I'm gonna try my best.

1307
00:59:47.375 --> 00:59:49.335
That's all I can
ask for. sweetheart.

1308
00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:55.341
I'm gonna go see
a man about a horse.

1309
00:59:55.341 --> 00:59:58.136
Okay. (chuckles) you do that.

1310
00:59:58.136 --> 00:59:59.929
And be careful of
the psycho hippie.

1311
01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:02.015
He's long gone.

1312
01:00:11.816 --> 01:00:12.650
Okay.

1313
01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.488
Hi. Kayla.

1314
01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:25.330
I feel so stupid doing
this. but I'm gonna try.

1315
01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:29.125
You know. I know that we were
talking about everything.

1316
01:00:32.253 --> 01:00:34.088
And it just. (exhales).

1317
01:00:37.216 --> 01:00:38.509
I wanted to say that I was.

1318
01:00:38.509 --> 01:00:42.764
I. I'm. I'm really sorry.

1319
01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:46.809
I've really been selfish.

1320
01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:50.730
I. I always thought
that I could just get by

1321
01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.357
saying. you know.

1322
01:00:53.524 --> 01:00:55.693
"I like to drink a lot
and I like to do drugs.

1323
01:00:55.693 --> 01:00:57.403
"And it's just my thing.

1324
01:00:57.403 --> 01:00:59.280
"and you know I'm
gonna do my thing."

1325
01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.785
And. you know. "It's my life.
nobody else is affected."

1326
01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.040
But other people are affected

1327
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:13.878
and after talking with everyone.

1328
01:01:13.878 --> 01:01:16.547
it's pretty hard to keep
going in that direction. so.

1329
01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:19.008
I just wanted to say that

1330
01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:24.138
I'm gonna try to
go a different way.

1331
01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:30.770
And I. I wish I could
take it all back.

1332
01:01:33.272 --> 01:01:34.065
And I love you.

1333
01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:40.279
Jameson?

1334
01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:43.157
David?

1335
01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:45.743
God.
- Oh.

1336
01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:47.745
The black sheep.

1337
01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:55.461
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to startle you.

1338
01:01:55.461 --> 01:01:59.716
It's okay. man. it's just
you were super weird over there

1339
01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.342
and now you're
sneaking up on me.

1340
01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:07.348
Oh. the Father requires
a ritual when a sacrifice

1341
01:02:07.932 --> 01:02:08.850
is to be made.

1342
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:13.688
The cleansing of iniquity
and shame cannot happen

1343
01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:15.940
unless one is willing.

1344
01:02:17.358 --> 01:02:20.528
Yeah. see that's
the weird part.

1345
01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:25.324
Look I'm. I'm super happy
that you found your purpose.

1346
01:02:25.324 --> 01:02:27.118
In meetings. they talk
about a higher power

1347
01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.411
and I'm never listening.

1348
01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:32.373
But maybe I should
listen. ya know?

1349
01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:37.795
My brother. I'm so
happy to hear that.

1350
01:02:40.965 --> 01:02:44.594
Only through me does
one reach The Father.

1351
01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:25.885
Hello. Father.

1352
01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:30.389
Oh I speak to you on all
kinds of mediums today.

1353
01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:33.810
I found the people
you sent me for.

1354
01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:36.604
They did not receive my message.

1355
01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:42.360
But Father. fear not. I
will extend it to them

1356
01:03:43.694 --> 01:03:46.656
through any means necessary
so that your grace.

1357
01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.909
your grace. may lay upon
the land like a blanket

1358
01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:50.785
upon the babe.

1359
01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:53.704
Oh Father. I will
make you proud.

1360
01:03:56.123 --> 01:03:57.959
I will make you proud.

1361
01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:04.590
I am really happy with how
everything is going so far.

1362
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:07.468
and how everyone has shared.

1363
01:04:08.886 --> 01:04:12.723
And. um. I just hope when you
watch this. that you can see

1364
01:04:12.723 --> 01:04:14.851
all of that. and
it will help you.

1365
01:04:16.477 --> 01:04:20.481
And that last
conversation we had.

1366
01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:23.568
it was really beautiful.

1367
01:04:23.568 --> 01:04:26.153
And I could see the
humanity that you have.

1368
01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:30.241
and I could see the man
that I fell in love with.

1369
01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:34.829
And I just hope that. um.

1370
01:04:40.084 --> 01:04:43.504
I hope that this will help
you come out a better person.

1371
01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:51.596
Hey. you okay?

1372
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.975
Yeah. I'm just
talking to the camera.

1373
01:04:55.975 --> 01:04:58.436
Yeah I heard you. I
didn't wanna interrupt.

1374
01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:02.023
Yeah. you know. I'm.

1375
01:05:03.482 --> 01:05:05.401
I'm just hoping that this
would fix him. you know?

1376
01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:06.235
I just.

1377
01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:10.281
I just want him back.

1378
01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.327
Tall order.

1379
01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:19.081
Um. maybe we shouldn't
hope that this fixes him.

1380
01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:22.418
But maybe we hope that it
gives him the perspective

1381
01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:23.669
so he can fix himself.

1382
01:05:25.838 --> 01:05:30.843
Can I ask you. David. why
is it that you stuck around?

1383
01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:33.387
I mean. I've seen the way
Richard has treated you.

1384
01:05:33.387 --> 01:05:35.222
so why do you stay?

1385
01:05:36.974 --> 01:05:38.809
I guess I'm like you.

1386
01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:41.812
Um. I've always seen
the good in Rich.

1387
01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.690
And I've always been
a fan of the underdog

1388
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:48.069
and there is no one
more under than Rich.

1389
01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:51.072
He is an underdog isn't he?

1390
01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:54.408
- Yeah.
- But he wasn't always

1391
01:05:54.408 --> 01:05:55.660
like that. you know.

1392
01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:58.454
it's like he brought
this upon himself.

1393
01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:00.748
Well. that's what makes
him endearing. ya know?

1394
01:06:00.748 --> 01:06:02.249
The guy that wasn't a fuck up.

1395
01:06:02.249 --> 01:06:04.961
who became a fuck up because
he wanted to be a fuck up.

1396
01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.922
Do you really think he
decided to be one though?

1397
01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:08.756
No.

1398
01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:14.470
No. I think addiction is a
disease. and I think addiction

1399
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:17.139
decided that for you.
and you don't realize it

1400
01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:18.140
until it's too late.

1401
01:06:20.226 --> 01:06:23.270
Yeah. that is some greeting
card stuff right there.

1402
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:28.025
Yeah. well. let's
hope that he can realize

1403
01:06:28.025 --> 01:06:31.237
that he's loved. and
what he stands to lose.

1404
01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:35.199
Anyway. I'm gonna go to sleep.

1405
01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:36.325
For real this time.

1406
01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:38.327
Why. why so early?

1407
01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:40.454
I mean. look. the
stars. it's incredible.

1408
01:06:40.454 --> 01:06:41.956
and I'm all alone out here.

1409
01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:45.001
Yes. I know. but I. I got
about three hours of sleep

1410
01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:48.337
last night. and Rich
is just exhausting.

1411
01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:51.340
So. I'm just gonna put
some music in my ears

1412
01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:52.800
and tune out the world.

1413
01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.762
Um. but if you need
anything. I'm right there.

1414
01:06:57.638 --> 01:06:59.056
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1415
01:07:00.057 --> 01:07:02.059
Good night.
- Good night.

1416
01:07:02.059 --> 01:07:03.144

01:07:21.662 --> 01:07:22.496

1431
01:08:25.851 --> 01:08:27.061
to the bathroom.

1432
01:08:27.061 --> 01:08:28.229
I saw a light over there.

1433
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:30.314
I think he was
filming himself. so.

1434
01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:32.775
Yeah. that sound like Richard.

1435
01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:35.486
Kayla. how blind can you be?

1436
01:08:36.737 --> 01:08:38.989
How long has he be gone?

1437
01:08:38.989 --> 01:08:40.241
Long enough to take some pills.

1438
01:08:40.241 --> 01:08:41.784
or down a bottle
of God knows what?

1439
01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:44.537
Dayna. stop it. okay. stop it.

1440
01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:46.247
Right. I checked him
and all his stuff

1441
01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:47.498
before we came up here.

1442
01:08:47.498 --> 01:08:48.874
You check everywhere?

1443
01:08:48.874 --> 01:08:50.126
Yeah. 'cause I mean.
what. he ain't been able

1444
01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.669
to get nothing past you before?

1445
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:55.589
Look. I'm pretty sure this
dude Richard done smuggled

1446
01:08:55.589 --> 01:08:57.299
some shit up here. all right?

1447
01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:58.843
And he probably in the
forest somewhere getting high

1448
01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:00.761
right now.
- Yeah. probably smuggled it

1449
01:09:00.761 --> 01:09:02.763
in his butt.
- Richard. that's what he do.

1450
01:09:02.763 --> 01:09:04.682
That's Richard. man.

1451
01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:07.059
Ew. that is so gross.

1452
01:09:07.059 --> 01:09:10.604
Babe. I know you want
this to work. obviously.

1453
01:09:10.604 --> 01:09:12.940
But if he just went to
pee. he'd be back by now.

1454
01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:15.109
- Facts.
- I told you this

1455
01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.444
before we left.
- I wish you weren't right.

1456
01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:21.365
Maybe.
- Right. that's Richard.

1457
01:09:21.365 --> 01:09:22.449
That's what he do.

1458
01:09:25.369 --> 01:09:26.954
We came up here for nothing.

1459
01:09:26.954 --> 01:09:27.788
No.

1460
01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:33.502
Are you okay?

1461
01:09:34.795 --> 01:09:36.130
- Yeah.
- I don't wanna

1462
01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:38.132
leave you alone.
- It's fine. David's here.

1463
01:09:38.132 --> 01:09:40.634
- Okay.
- Have fun.

1464
01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:43.888
Goddamn it. Richard.

1465
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.017
We ain't gonna make it. huh?

1466
01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:49.768
- Yeah.
- Long day.

1467
01:09:49.768 --> 01:09:51.478
Kind of what we
expected. right?

1468
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.982
I really wish we weren't right.

1469
01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:56.483
But like what else
is he usually doing

1470
01:09:56.483 --> 01:09:58.319
when he's gone that long?

1471
01:09:58.319 --> 01:10:02.031
Same ol' same. but.
I don't know. man.

1472
01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:03.657
Maybe we just being assholes.

1473
01:10:03.657 --> 01:10:06.785
He might've just went off to
just reflect on everything.

1474
01:10:08.954 --> 01:10:10.122
I mean. maybe.

1475
01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.666
Probably not though.

1476
01:10:12.666 --> 01:10:13.792
- Yeah.
- Mm.

1477
01:10:14.752 --> 01:10:16.003
You know how many times

1478
01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:17.796
I've had to talk my
sister off the ledge?

1479
01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:19.006
I bet. man.

1480
01:10:19.006 --> 01:10:21.008
Richard is a handful.

1481
01:10:21.008 --> 01:10:23.260
I mean. on a good day. and
he don't have any good days.

1482
01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:24.511
Yeah like.
what are those?

1483
01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:27.514
So. how did your
sister get you out here?

1484
01:10:27.514 --> 01:10:29.683
Like how does she keep
roping you into this stuff?

1485
01:10:29.683 --> 01:10:33.562
Um. well. the same vicious
cycle usually starts.

1486
01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:35.606
Um. I ignore her phone calls.

1487
01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:36.607
- Okay.
- Then she starts

1488
01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:37.566
blowing up my phone.

1489
01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:40.945
and then she leaves some kind
of sensational message like.

1490
01:10:40.945 --> 01:10:43.447
"Hey. I'm gonna go
search some encampments

1491
01:10:43.447 --> 01:10:46.492
"and alleys like by myself."

1492
01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:48.035
I can't let my sister

1493
01:10:48.035 --> 01:10:50.329
trudge through the darkest
parts of LA by herself.

1494
01:10:51.538 --> 01:10:52.373
So I go with her.

1495
01:10:53.457 --> 01:10:55.000
Ya know?

1496
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.211
She loves him. she
wants to fight for him.

1497
01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.714
so all I can really
do is just be here

1498
01:11:00.714 --> 01:11:01.882
until she sees reason.

1499
01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:06.387
She got good intentions. man.

1500
01:11:06.387 --> 01:11:08.555
I honestly think
Rich could get sober.

1501
01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:10.933
It ain't gonna
happen on this trip.

1502
01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:12.268
What about you. yo?

1503
01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:14.228
That was a little
aggressive back there.

1504
01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:17.022
You get a little triggered
by that freaky weirdo?

1505
01:11:17.022 --> 01:11:18.524
It was barely even about that.

1506
01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:20.609
I didn't like that he just
ran up on us like that.

1507
01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:21.986
that wasn't cool.

1508
01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:23.237
I think you kinda
give that off.

1509
01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:25.030
like a Chandler
on "Friends" vibe.

1510
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:26.740
Yup. maybe.

1511
01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:29.451
Maybe what he said
was true. and I mean.

1512
01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:32.037
that's why I was pissed
off. but screw it.

1513
01:11:32.037 --> 01:11:36.166
Eh. look. the truth hurt. I
hurt him. you know. fuck it.

1514
01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:37.209
The universe is even.

1515
01:11:39.545 --> 01:11:40.421
Maybe I should try that.

1516
01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.423
More fist fights.

1517
01:11:42.423 --> 01:11:44.091
No. I'm just kidding (laughs).

1518
01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:46.844
The humor. the humor covering
up the hurt and anger.

1519
01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:48.178
yeah. then maybe my
sister wouldn't think

1520
01:11:48.178 --> 01:11:49.096
I was such a bitch.

1521
01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:55.102
- Kayla don't think that.
- Are you sure about that?

1522
01:11:57.021 --> 01:11:58.772
I don't think that.

1523
01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:00.941
You don't?

1524
01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:06.447
No. I think you are kind.

1525
01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:12.453
caring. and beautiful.

1526
01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:19.251
Fuck?
- Whoa.

1527
01:12:19.251 --> 01:12:21.420
What was that?
- Hey. hello?

1528
01:12:23.797 --> 01:12:25.466
Hello?
- Yo. yo. yo. yo.

1529
01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:27.009
- Hold up.
- Yo. let's go back

1530
01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:28.302
and get the crew.
- Na. na. na. fuck that.

1531
01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:30.429
Hey.
- These woods

1532
01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:31.889
would be better with them.
- Fuck that.

1533
01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:33.599
Hey yo. Rich. if you. if
you playing games out here.

1534
01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:34.808
man. I'm gonna beat your ass.

1535
01:12:34.808 --> 01:12:36.852
That does not
sound like Richard.

1536
01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:38.812
Chill out. ah. I got
this. you just wait here.

1537
01:12:38.812 --> 01:12:40.481
Yo. Jameson. please.
