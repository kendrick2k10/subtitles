00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.840
Spring 1940 - six months
into World War II.

4
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.440
Hitler's war machine
is on its way to Norway.

5
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.160
The primary goals are
to secure control of:

6
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.760
The Norwegian coast

7
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.240
The king

8
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.120
The government

9
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.160
and Norway's gold reserve

10
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.200
This is the story of the gold.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.600
8 APRIL 1940
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE INVASION

12
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.240
- Oh!
- How nice!

13
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.400
- Are you coming?
- Yes. I'll be right there.

14
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.320
- Just a minute.
- Let it be. Come on.

15
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.840
I'm almost done.

16
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.000
- Hello!
- Hi!

17
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.280
- I'm sorry we're late.
- That's fine. Hello.

18
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.080
- Hi. Chris.
- Hi. Uncle Fredrik.

19
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.960
We're about to serve the cake.

20
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.320
If Fredrik can part from it.

21
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.000
Hello.

22
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.360
- How nice.
- Look who's here! It's Chris!

23
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.480
- It's good enough now.
- I'll just light the candles.

24
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Hooray for you on your birthday
We want to congratulate you

25
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.720
We all stand around you in a ring
And look. now we will march

26
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.880
Bow and nod and curtsy...

27
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.120
We have to go down to the basement.

28
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.120
- Everyone.
- No. Dad! It's just a drill.

29
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.360
- Where's Nils?
- Nils?

30
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.520
- I thought you brought him.
- No. I didn't bring Nils.

31
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.560
Hey...

32
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.680
- Nils is watching the flat.
- But Dad. I've got to have Nils.

33
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.840
We can't go up during
the air-raid alarm to get Nils.

34
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.560
We can't do that.

35
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.080
- Is something wrong?
- Nils is upstairs.

36
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.800
Do you want me to take care of it?
Should I go and get Nils?

37
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.840
No. you don't have to do that.

38
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.160
Yes. I do. Nils is important.

39
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.960
Okay. Aunt Nini will get Nils.
It'll be fine.

40
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.840
Look what I found.

41
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.400
- And I brought this.
- Yes!

42
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.520
Nils!

43
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.640
Happy birthday

44
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.440
The commanding admiral reports:

45
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.080
Tonight. German warships
passed the Oslofjord Fortress

46
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.800
under fire
from the fortress's batteries

47
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.080
and continued onwards.

48
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.320
At 4:30 a.m..
heavy fire was reported

49
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.400
between some of the warships
and Oscarsborg.

50
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.480
A cruiser passed the fortress

51
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.280
but was later stranded at Digerud.

52
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.880
Other vessels have bombarded Horten.

53
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.640
German warships have also.
under fire from the fortress.

54
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.240
passed into Bergen.
which has been occupied.

55
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.040
Two ships have passed
into Trondheim.

56
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.680
The city has apparently
been occupied.

57
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.680
One ship has reached Narvik.

58
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.480
most likely after battle
with Norwegian vessels.

59
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.680
INVASION DAY
9 APRIL. EARLY MORNING

60
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.240
- How much time do we have?
- They're already here.

61
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.280
- What do we need?
- A miracle.

62
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.880
Pending a miracle.
how many lorries?

63
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.720
20. maybe 25.
in addition to the ones we have.

64
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.040
- Then you'll have to find them.
- I can't conjure up 20 lorries.

65
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.560
Unless you want me
to hijack vehicles.

66
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.320
Great idea. Get to it.

67
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.640
Is the mission clear?
We have to procure vehicles.

68
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.200
Yes. I just...

69
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.800
I think this goes against
my job description.

70
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.720
You have a new job now.

71
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.120
This day will be
a little out of the ordinary.

72
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.600
Yeah...

73
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.520
THE GOLD TRANSPORT

74
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.600
Irene. listen to me. Darling...

75
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.600
No! You can't mean that
we should just sit here and wait.

76
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.960
It will only take a few hours.
I'll be back soon.

77
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.400
I heard the planes. Fredrik.
I know what it means.

78
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.800
- So does the rest of Oslo.
- That's why I have to go down.

79
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.520
We possess sensitive information
that can't fall into German hands.

80
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.040
Veslemøy. please.

81
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.240
Can't someone else do it?

82
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.960
You don't lead that office.
You're a secretary.

83
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.280
I have a task to do.
and I have to go down there.

84
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.080
As soon as I'm back.
we'll go to Mylla.

85
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.760
The cabin is the safest place.
and I'll be back in a few hours.

86
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.360
I promise.

87
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.000
DRØBAK
36 KM OUTSIDE OF OSLO

88
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.200
- Oslo. please.
- No. we're going to Kolbotn.

89
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.760
You will drive me to Oslo.
It's important.

90
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.360
I have to get to the central bank.
It's very important.

91
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.480
You're wet.

92
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.400
The ship sank.

93
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:16.280
- Our ship was sunk.
- Were there any others on board?

94
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.960
THE LABOUR PARTY'S HEAD OFFICE

95
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.720
Burn it.

96
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.240
- Burn it.
- All right.

97
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.320
- Statistics from the year-end.
- Burn it.

98
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.040
This?

99
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.960
- Burn it.
- All right.

100
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.920
This will be sent. Don't put it
outside until the transport's here.

101
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.560
Burn it.

102
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.280
Wait. wait. wait.

103
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.280
- Excuse me? Haslund?
- Yes.

104
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.720
- The finance minister's office.
- I'll call them back later.

105
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.160
- Burn it.
- Haslund.

106
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.040
It's the finance minister himself.

107
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.520
Okay.

108
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.560
Burn it. Check it. Burn it.

109
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.320
Hello?

110
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.160
- Hello?
- Oscar? Is everything all right?

111
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.240
Fredrik. I need a driver.

112
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.240
We have to evacuate.

113
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.720
I don't understand.
You need drivers?

114
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.280
Jesus Christ. We're being invaded.

115
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.720
I need someone I can trust.

116
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.400
- Like an old friend. Fredrik.
- I understand.

117
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.000
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Thanks. Thank you.

118
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.400
Irene?

119
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.080
Dear Fredrik.
Come as soon as you can

120
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.800
Love. your girls

121
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.040
The Brits have mined
the Norwegian coast.

122
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.160
Should Germany come to our rescue?

123
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.760
Brats like you who lick the arses of
the Brownshirts should be castrated!

124
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.520
Get lost!

125
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.440
What the hell?

126
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.080
Hey!

127
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.520
No. no. no! No!

128
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.480
I'm not a car thief.
I'm not trying to steal your lorry.

129
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.680
I'm from
the central bank of Norway.

130
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.320
If you're from the central bank.
I'm Jesus of Nazareth.

131
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.800
No. no. no!

132
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.080
I'm on an important mission.
We need transports.

133
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.960
Up to Lillehammer. Here.

134
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.280
Read this.

135
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.160
Scram.

136
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.200
I said scram!

137
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.040
What's the cargo?

138
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.800
THE CENTRAL BANK OF NORWAY

139
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.960
Come on!

140
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.080
There. I found a driver and a lorry.

141
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.800
- That's good. What's that?
- I don't want to talk about it.

142
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.760
- I beg your pardon?
- It was quite traumatic. actually.

143
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.840
Sit still!

144
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.240
- It's not him.
- Yes. it is.

145
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.040
I should have cancelled
my appointments.

146
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.240
- It seems the world is about to...
- Hey. hey. hey!

147
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.080
It's him.

148
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.600
Right.

149
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.960
No mobilisation orders?

150
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.200
I can see the Germans
outside the window!

151
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.560
Nanna. what's the status of the
lorries from Kristiania Transport?

152
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.920
All of them were rerouted
to the central bank.

153
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.160
Hello! Can I get
everyone's attention?

154
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.640
I just talked
to Police Chief Welhaven.

155
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.160
and the Evacuation Commission
is being disbanded.

156
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.800
effective immediately.

157
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.000
But we're the ones
with the evacuation plan.

158
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.840
The government has started
the evacuation without us.

159
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.600
But that's our entire purpose.

160
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.000
We have to shred everything
and leave the city.

161
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.280
What. and flee?
We should fight back.

162
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.880
Feel free to volunteer
and find a gun.

163
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.400
but I'm leaving...

164
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.320
Come on!

165
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.760
- Is this the last crate?
- It's the last one.

166
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.280
Over here.

167
00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.280
Drive straight to Lillehammer.
No stops. no passengers.

168
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.440
- Get in.
- In the back?

169
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.800
- You'll watch the cargo.
- No. I'm a bank clerk.

170
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.920
You work for the bank. This will be
one of your most important tasks.

171
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.120
Sitting in the back
of a speeding lorry?

172
00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.960
Do I have to explain
to one of my own employees

173
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.160
how the gold standard works?

174
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.360
This is the foundation
of our economy.

175
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.120
If the Germans get hold of it.
they'll have a stranglehold on us.

176
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.520
Get in!

177
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.840
- Goddamn it!
- Hey. stop it! Stop!

178
00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.440
Not a word to anyone
about what we're transporting.

179
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.280
And if we run into any Germans.
we're lucky that he's armed.

180
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.840
Oh. damn.

181
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.760
Go home now.

182
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.480
It won't be any pleasant
at work in the days to come.

183
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.440
Kristiansand has suffered
from air raids.

184
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.720
German troops have gone ashore
in Egersund.

185
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.240
Tønsberg reports
that at 5:30 this morning.

186
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.360
a squad of German troops
went ashore at Vallø

187
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.560
outside of Tønsberg.
numbering around 20 soldiers.

188
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.640
The inhabitants have abandoned
the lighthouse

189
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.800
and are moving towards Tønsberg.

190
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.400
A shot was fired
from the Norwegian side.

191
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.000
but the Germans have remained calm.

192
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.240
No. stop! Wait.

193
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.960
- The gold?
- On its way to Lillehammer.

194
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.920
And the governor
of the central bank?

195
00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.640
I can't reach him.
but he knows what to do.

196
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.520
Okay. Drive.

197
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.880
We have...

198
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.720
searched. but...

199
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.920
we can't find...

200
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.080
- Schlüssel?
- Die? Der?

201
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.240
- Der Schlüssel.
- Der Schlüssel.

202
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.080
Mr Rygg.

203
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.360
It is important for you
to understand

204
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.000
that our great Reich comes in peace.

205
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.600
We love Norway.

206
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.000
I love you.

207
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.640
The key.

208
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.360
Here. The key.

209
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.920
Light.

210
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.120
Hey! You!

211
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.800
I'll freeze to death if I stay here
all the way to Lillehammer!

212
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.320
- There. Good.
- No. you can't.

213
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.600
- But there's room for more.
- We don't allow passengers.

214
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.200
- No passengers?
- I'm sorry.

215
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.200
- You're meant to take care of this!
- I'm trying!

216
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.720
No!

217
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.560
There.

218
00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.960
I said no. No.

219
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.080
You can't just drive
without taking passengers!

220
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.640
The minister of foreign affairs said
that he this morning at five o'clock

221
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.720
was visited by the German envoy.

222
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.640
who both in writing
and verbally made it clear

223
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.800
that Norway should not resist

224
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.480
now that the Germans
have landed troops

225
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.240
in key locations throughout Norway.

226
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.080
He said that the best thing
for Norway would be

227
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.680
to submit
to German military administration.

228
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.200
Is that...?

229
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.680
JØRSTADMOEN MILITARY CAMP

230
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.440
It looks like him.

231
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.280
Can I get your autograph?

232
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.560
Of course.

233
00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.880
Attention!

234
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.520
I'm here to report for duty.

235
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:41.600
THE CENTRAL BANK OF NORWAY
LILLEHAMMER BRANCH

236
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.640
Here we are. That was painless.

237
00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.240
Are you just going to sit there?

238
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.920
Thanks for the help. everyone.

239
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.880
The cargo is safe here.

240
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:32.120
Thank you. Go home. but be careful.

241
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.160
THE GOVERNMENT'S SAFE HOUSE OTTA

242
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.240
Excuse me.

243
00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.440
Do you have another telephone?

244
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.280
I'm afraid not.
We only have the one.

245
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.240
Hi. Do you want a ride?

246
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.280
We're heading back to Oslo.

247
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.840
In the back?

248
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.720
No thank you. Never again.

249
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.840
- It's time to go.
- Yes.

250
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.440
Where are we headed?

251
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.400
Bank Governor Rygg thought

252
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.800
that the gold reserve would be safe
in Lillehammer.

253
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.000
It's not.

254
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.320
I need someone who can...

255
00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.480
take over the responsibility
of the gold.

256
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.120
We have to get it out
of the country.

257
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:24.240
Well. Oscar. a task like that
should go to someone

258
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.720
in the banking sector
or the military.

259
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.400
I'm not asking as a friend.

260
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.520
I'm not asking for a favour.
This is an order.

261
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.720
I'm giving you the mission

262
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.640
of leading the transport
of Norway's gold reserve.

263
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.520
THE CENTRAL BANK OF NORWAY

264
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.600
I'm sorry. I hope you understand.

265
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.800
Is there a plan?

266
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.440
We have to get it to the west coast.
Åndalsnes is still safe.

267
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.400
We'll get support from British
naval vessels and troops there.

268
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.920
You will have a company
at your disposal.

269
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.920
You need a military escort.

270
00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.560
Irene and Veslemøy are
at the cabin. In Mylla.

271
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.480
They must leave the country.

272
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.960
Why?

273
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.320
If the Germans learn
that you're leading this.

274
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.200
you'll be one
of the most wanted men in Norway.

275
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.000
Where are the rest of the documents?

276
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.960
I apologise. but...

277
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.880
who are you?

278
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.400
What qualifications do you have?

279
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.600
Like I said. I have been charged
with securing and...

280
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.880
transporting the gold reserve.

281
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:31.800
Could you please open the vault.
so I can begin the registration?

282
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.440
Like I told you. I can't do anything

283
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.600
without Rygg's consent.

284
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.680
Try again.

285
00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.440
Bank Governor Rygg.

286
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.560
This great responsibility

287
00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:56.880
has been personally entrusted
to me by our Führer.

288
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.040
Do you know what that means?

289
00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.080
Where is the gold?

290
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.080
Major. do you have a minute?

291
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.080
- Heil og sæl.
- Heil Hitler.

292
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.080
- Tell the major.
- Two men argued about a lorry.

293
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.600
One of them
was from the central bank.

294
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.720
He mentioned
a mission to Lillehammer.

295
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.280
Lillehammer.

296
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.760
Bravo. boys. Very good.

297
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.480
Yes. they're at a cabin
not too far away from you.

298
00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.040
They don't have
a telephone. so if...

299
00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.680
I understand. Yes. Thank you.

300
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.360
Fredrik Haslund?

301
00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.200
Oslo is...

302
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.400
There are Nazi flags everywhere.

303
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.760
At the parliament and the palace.

304
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.920
I've volunteered.

305
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.440
So has Kristian.
He will follow the government.

306
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.720
I can't reach Veslemøy and Irene.

307
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.560
They have to leave the country
as soon as possible.

308
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.960
Yes. But...

309
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.480
It's some mission you've been given.

310
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.920
I don't feel that I have a choice.
I don't have a choice.

311
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.400
- How much gold is it?
- I don't know.

312
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.760
But it's all
of Norway's gold reserve.

313
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.960
They want me to transport
the gold to Åndalsnes

314
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.400
and load it onto
a British naval vessel.

315
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.080
- Have you talked to the Brits?
- No.

316
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.760
If you're leading this mission.
I want in.

317
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.480
It would be a little weird
to recruit one's own sister.

318
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.040
Why? I'm not just your sister.
I'm an asset.

319
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.720
I have experience from the war
in Spain. and I speak English.

320
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.840
I can travel ahead
and contact the Brits.

321
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.600
LIST NO.:

322
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.400
Modern warfare. gentlemen.
requires an inner life.

323
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:28.200
Building and developing yourself
puts you in a state of defence

324
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.120
against the catastrophe
that is threatening the world.

325
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.320
The Nazis will never prevail
in one-on-one combat against us

326
00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.480
because our idea
is better than theirs.

327
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.840
Troop! Fall in!

328
00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.200
Line up! Line up!

329
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.000
Major. troop ready.

330
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.640
Soldier. button up your uniform.

331
00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.760
You may have authorisation.

332
00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.560
but it was completely unnecessary
to come all the way to Lillehammer.

333
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.280
Let me remind you that
I was personally appointed

334
00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.720
by the finance minister.

335
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.880
I don't work
for the finance minister.

336
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.880
I work for the boss
of the central bank of Norway.

337
00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.520
He's nowhere to be found.
That's why I am here.

338
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.600
The Germans are coming.

339
00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.400
I won't open the vault
for them either.

340
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.560
There you are.

341
00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.920
Goddamn.

342
00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.760
I've waited here
all night and all day.

343
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.280
- Oh. dear.
- Where have you been?

344
00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.480
Good question. Here and there.

345
00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.080
And that's between me and the Lord.

346
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.240
Oh. goddamn. I have to take a piss.

347
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.920
Why are you parked here?
Why aren't you outside the bank?

348
00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.360
It's time to load up.

349
00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.440
Park outside the entrance
right away.

350
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.120
Aye. aye. sir.

351
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.840
Shouldn't we...?

352
00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.640
Sure. but I have
to take a piss first.

353
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.240
Excuse me?
Where can I find Fredrik Haslund?

354
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.000
That's me.

355
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.720
Major Bjørn Sunde.
Head of the military escort.

356
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.880
The train is ready at the station.
Why isn't anyone loading?

357
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.280
We're in a challenging situation
right now.

358
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.240
Oh? What's the problem?

359
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.200
Mr Lund has a dilemma.

360
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.240
Who is Mr Lund?

361
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.320
When the chain of command is broken.

362
00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.560
you must act on your own initiative.
Everyone knows that.

363
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.920
Maybe in the military.
but not in the banking sector.

364
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.120
Mr Lund. I sympathise
with your current situation.

365
00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.040
But right now. I think there is
legal authority to overrule.

366
00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.440
Just get him out. Get him out.

367
00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.200
Please.

368
00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.840
Someone else can open it. You!

369
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.400
Only Mr Lund knows the combination.

370
00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.120
Get him back. Get him back!

371
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.280
Mr Lund.

372
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.800
If you check the regulations.
I'm sure you'll find an exception.

373
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.240
Mr Lund.

374
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.880
Do you know the consequences
of insubordination in war?

375
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.680
Whoever refuses to obey an order

376
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.480
from the commanding general
in wartime

377
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:37.000
will. as is known. be shot.

378
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.320
You will be shot!

379
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.840
If I am to be shot.

380
00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:53.680
it damn well won't be on the orders
of the Norwegian authorities.

381
00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.760
Please excuse me.

382
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.480
Thank you for the help.

383
00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.480
But in the future. I want to handle
things like this myself.

384
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.880
No. Haslund.
This is now a military operation.

385
00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.360
So you will obey me.

386
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:19.680
I'm the ranking officer here.
Let there be no doubts about that.

387
00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:24.280
Let me remind you
that this is a civilian operation

388
00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.120
with a military escort.

389
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.760
So in actuality.
I am the commanding officer.

390
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:44.600
Is... everything all right?

391
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.560
Yes. I think I just missed a number.

392
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:53.360
I'll do it from the beginning.
Just give me a minute.

393
00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.520
Lillehammer.

394
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.040
I hope there's a hotel
with a bathtub.

395
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.040
And wheat beer.

396
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.760
I can't stand Norwegian beer.

397
00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.280
I don't get it. There must be
something wrong with the door.

398
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.160
Lund. Are you sure you haven't
written down the combination?

399
00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.760
I have the instructions here.
I keep the rest in my head.

400
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:25.000
Unbelievable. The entire nation's
financial future is at stake.

401
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.720
and we have a bank manager
who can't open his own vault.

402
00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.320
I'm doing my best.

403
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.760
Can we at least agree
that this is obstruction?

404
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.640
He's most likely a collaborator.

405
00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.840
My impression is
that he's doing his best.

406
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.800
Are you willing to take that chance?

407
00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.520
Do we have another solution?

408
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.320
DANGER
EXPLOSIVES

409
00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.320
- Take cover!
- Come on!

410
00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.480
Sunde. he's not coming out.

411
00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.840
That's his own choice.

412
00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.000
The Germans have now passed Hamar.

413
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.600
They'll be here before long.
Haslund! We're going to detonate!

414
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.600
Haslund!
The Germans will be here soon!

415
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.160
Hey!

416
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:52.000
I usually eat an olive when
I have to do something important

417
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.880
or when I'm confronted
with a challenge.

418
00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.560
Mr Lund...

419
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.480
There's a major outside
who wants to blow open your door.

420
00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:09.400
Soon. German soldiers will be here
who probably want to do the same.

421
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.800
Mr Lund?

422
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.200
The most important thing now
is to control your breathing.

423
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:40.280
No thank you.
I shouldn't get sticky fingers.

424
00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.400
I understand.

425
00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.360
- We have to tell Sunde right away.
- Of course.

426
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.160
Sunde!

427
00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.120
Any government officials
and other civil servants.

428
00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.280
and especially
any military officers.

429
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:21.000
are obligated to only obey orders
from the new national government.

430
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.360
Any deviation
will lead to serious...

431
00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.680
Sheep's milk in the fingers. I see.
Get in. We'll drive to the station.

432
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.320
Come on!

433
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.440
German paratroopers
were spotted at Dombås.

434
00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.800
Forces from Åndalsnes
and Jørstadmoen are moving in.

435
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.360
Thank you. Sunde.

436
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.680
Next.

437
00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.120
66.

438
00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.120
NUMBER OF LARGE CRATES

439
00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.200
I just have to ask. Are you going
to do that with all of them?

440
00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.520
- We need an overview.
- 402.

441
00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.640
Next.

442
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.200
- How many crates are there?
- That's what we need to know.

443
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.960
- How much time will you spend on it?
- As long as it takes.

444
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:24.280
I just have to say that it's
an honour to serve Norway

445
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.160
in such a difficult period
in our nation's history.

446
00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.320
- Was that...?
- Yes. that's him.

447
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:50.320
- Hi. Are you Nordahl Grieg?
- Yes. that's right.

448
00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:55.960
I saw Our Honour and Our Glory
at the National Theatre.

449
00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.520
I just want to say
that it really moved me.

450
00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:04.320
- Are you just going to stand there?
- No. I...

451
00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.880
Thank you. Or...

452
00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.640
- Come on.
- Yeah.

453
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.960
Sunde. what should we do
about the German paratroopers?

454
00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.400
You're lazing about. I see.
I have a task for you.

455
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:41.280
We need a vanguard to report
any sabotage or enemy activity.

456
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.920
Right. I have a question.
I'm from the central bank in Oslo...

457
00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.840
You can forget Oslo.

458
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:53.040
And if the Germans stop this train.
all of us will most likely die.

459
00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.440
Use this.

460
00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.640
It's a flare gun.
Fire it if you see anything.

461
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.280
Should we drive the lorry?

462
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.720
This is your fault.

463
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.600
You know that?

464
00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.360
I could have been home now. but no.

465
00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.720
You had to go out
and have a good time.

466
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.840
I hear what you're saying. kid.
but we're here now.

467
00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.520
so keep your mouth shut.
Use the torch.

468
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.040
I can't see for shit here.

469
00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.000
We have a complete inventory.
1.503 crates of gold bullion.

470
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.800
39 barrels of coins.

471
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.080
divided among five freight wagons.

472
00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.080
Total weight. 52 tonnes.
Sign it. please.

473
00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.280
They're here.

474
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.760
- Thanks for the help.
- Good luck.

475
00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.640
There. Everything is on board.

476
00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.080
At last.

477
00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:04.800
Bank Manager Andreas Lund.

478
00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.040
Sit down!

479
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.520
Sit down.

480
00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.240
Do you understand German?

481
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.200
Yes.

482
00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.960
Where is the gold?

483
00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.280
I don't know.

484
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.400
I could have been at home now.
in a warm bed. drinking hot cocoa.

485
00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:42.720
- Stop your damn whining.
- I have frostbite in my fingernails.

486
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:46.920
One of my teeth is probably loose.
And it's all your fault!

487
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.760
Says the man
who tried to steal my ride.

488
00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.720
We're in the same situation.
but you don't hear me whining.

489
00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.040
I could have been
more useful somewhere else.

490
00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.720
- Someplace warmer.
- Yeah. I see.

491
00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:08.160
Let's see if Mr Bank Clerk
can warm up in some other way.

492
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.560
Come on.

493
00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.240
Full speed ahead.

494
00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.520
Are you tired already?

495
00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.480
What's that?

496
00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.120
It looks like a person.

497
00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.000
- Hey! Move!
- Shush!

498
00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:13.040
- Maybe we should warn them.
- No. we'll handle this.

499
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.400
Hey. hey. hey. He might be armed.

500
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.960
Only one way to find out.

501
00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.960
Hey... Who is he?

502
00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.120
A dead German.

503
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.200
- What did you say?
- A dead German.

504
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.640
Are you just going to sit there.
or are you going to help me?

505
00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.320
Grenade!

506
00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.360
Odd Henry?

507
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.080
Odd Henry!

508
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.600
Don't shoot!

509
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.960
Troop! Ready your weapons!

510
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.080
Lower your guns! We're Norwegians!

511
00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.440
Sunde. they're Norwegians.

512
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.040
Right.

513
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.560
Can anyone tell us what's going on?
These two won't say anything.

514
00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.600
Right... It's a secret mission.

515
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.480
For a secret mission.
they've made one hell of a racket.

516
00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.800
What were those shots?

517
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.760
We opened fire
when your boys shouted in German.

518
00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.360
Fortunately. no one was hit.

519
00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.520
- Any news about the Germans?
- There's a lot of them.

520
00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:43.520
We got these two. They didn't
have time to unpack their guns.

521
00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.920
Good job. soldier.

522
00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:49.440
You should get going. It's light.
and planes patrol this area.

523
00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.040
- It's not safe.
- Right.

524
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.480
We had a discussion on the train.

525
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.440
Should we relieve ourselves
in the tunnel

526
00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.720
or outside. in the bushes?

527
00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.400
You're Norway's greatest poet.

528
00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.920
Isn't it a waste
to use you as a soldier?

529
00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.160
You know what they say.

530
00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:53.480
"War is much too serious a thing
to be left to military men."

531
00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.680
In order to write...

532
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.680
you need knowledge.

533
00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.840
You need
to experience things yourself.

534
00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.520
And you. Haslund?

535
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.200
You are a secretary

536
00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.280
in the Labour Party's
parliamentary group.

537
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:16.400
Don't you wonder why you were picked
to lead such a large operation?

538
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.880
It's a big responsibility.

539
00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.320
Grieg. toilet visits
should be done inside the tunnel.

540
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:30.040
The Norwegians will try
to move the gold abroad.

541
00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.800
The gold is on a train.
Do you understand?

542
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.320
Is the mission too difficult?

543
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.040
No. the mission is not
too difficult.

544
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.160
but we need more planes.

545
00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:43.000
- Don't you know where the train is?
- It's not about where the train is.

546
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.880
It's about where it's going.

547
00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:49.760
And the coast of Møre
is under British control.

548
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:55.080
So if they get there before us.
they can load the gold onto ships.

549
00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.640
Then we have to bomb the ships.

550
00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.720
We can't sink the ships
if we want the gold.

551
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.520
We will soon have to refuel.

552
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.240
It won't get any darker than this.

553
00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.720
Let's go.

554
00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.160
Soldiers! Germans!

555
00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:13.200
Troop! Ready your weapons! Take aim!

556
00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:19.080
- How many?
- Hard to say. Major.

557
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.520
On my command!

558
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.600
A civilian's coming!

559
00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.400
Unarmed.

560
00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.640
Major. it's a woman.

561
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.160
It's my sister.

562
00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.280
Lower your weapons.

563
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.840
Keep going.

564
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.480
Hi.

565
00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.520
- Major Bjørn Sunde.
- Nini Gleditsch.

566
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.200
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

567
00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.960
So you came with the Brits?

568
00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.840
Yes. From here on.
the coast is clear to Åndalsnes.

569
00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.560
There's a cruiser there. Galatea.

570
00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:36.360
It has room for our heavy baggage.

571
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.720
You hear that. lads?
It's safe from here to Åndalsnes!

572
00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.520
Don't celebrate just yet.

573
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.920
We have to carry the gold
onto the ship first.

574
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.920
That's fine. Just one final push.
and we're going home.

575
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:51.240
If we keep this up. we can all
celebrate Constitution Day in Oslo.

576
00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.760
Nordahl!

577
00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:57.080
A bad penny always turns up.

578
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.480
- We're not doing this again?
- I'm afraid so.

579
00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.400
We're only going from here to there.

580
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.800
We can't have this argument
every single time.

581
00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.920
I have to deliver control lists

582
00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.640
to the central bank
and the Ministry of Finance.

583
00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.040
The wagons are sealed.

584
00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:28.120
We know the crates are there.
They can be counted on board.

585
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:32.160
What would you do with a soldier
who was constantly insubordinate?

586
00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:45.120
The crates are going
from the train to the ship.

587
00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.720
after they've been registered.

588
00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.760
Thank you.

589
00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.200
- 76.
- Thank you.

590
00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.240
923.

591
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.560
NUMBER OF SMALL CRATES

592
00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.440
- 756.
- 111.

593
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.560
- 39.
- 791.

594
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.760
That's good.

595
00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.280
All the way in.

596
00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.280
Major Stoltmann to the Luftwaffe.

597
00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.120
A train with cargo belonging
to the German Reich

598
00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.200
has arrived in Åndalsnes.

599
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:58.080
Stop the transfer of the cargo!
Bomb the train!

600
00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.440
Copy that. We're on our way.

601
00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.280
Okay. Move along.

602
00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.760
Prepare to retreat!

603
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.440
Admiral. please sign.

604
00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.880
Fredrik!

605
00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.640
Come on!

606
00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.240
Get on the train! Everyone!

607
00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.160
Everyone on the train!

608
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.480
Come on!

609
00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.480
Get down!

610
01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.240
Cover your ears!

611
01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.960
Listen to me! Cover your ears!

612
01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.480
Get down!

613
01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:40.320
I have to get out!

614
01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.160
Get down!

615
01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.640
Come here.

616
01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.120
It'll be fine.

617
01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.200
It'll be fine. Breathe.

618
01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.920
Breathe. It'll be fine.

619
01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.400
Get him out!

620
01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.000
Get him out!

621
01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.920
Come on! Hurry up!

622
01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.800
Water! We need water here!

623
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.560
Come on!

624
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.960
How much blood
do you want on your hands?

625
01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.160
For how long
should we be sitting ducks

626
01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:40.480
while you enter every single number
into your forms?

627
01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:44.600
Numbers! That's what you care about.
Not wounded men. but numbers!

628
01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.360
Your meticulousness was about
to get all of us pulverised.

629
01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.920
Do you get that?

630
01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.560
This is war!

631
01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.440
And we get a secretary to lead us.

632
01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.760
You are a paper pusher.
You are nothing!

633
01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.840
I've been in the army all my life.
I breathe war.

634
01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.880
Fredrik.

635
01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.800
Don't listen to him.

636
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.880
Are you okay?

637
01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.600
They'd never send bombers
into these mountains.

638
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.600
Come on.

639
01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.040
More water! Come on! Water!

640
01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.640
Copy that.

641
01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.240
We have a problem.

642
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.360
Fredrik.

643
01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.840
The telegraph in Åndalsnes
has lost contact with the Brits.

644
01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.920
They've moved. and no one
has told the central where to.

645
01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.400
I have to go back
to Åndalsnes and find them.

646
01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.720
No. you're not going to Åndalsnes.

647
01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.200
We'll wait until
the bombing lets up.

648
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.560
Yeah.

649
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.320
Fredrik. you have to get a grip.

650
01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.120
You can't show those people
that you're about to fall apart.

651
01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.120
I...

652
01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:23.240
Nini...

653
01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.720
We could have been killed.
All of us.

654
01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:29.000
We could have been killed.

655
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.840
And...

656
01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:38.120
I don't know
how to talk to soldiers.

657
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.480
Hey... this is so crazy.

658
01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.560
When I decided to adopt Chris...

659
01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:04.840
and bring her to Norway.
it was to give her a better life.

660
01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:10.480
So she wouldn't have to grow up
in a fascist country.

661
01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.960
But now. the Germans have come here.

662
01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.880
And if I am to keep
my promise to her.

663
01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.000
I have to go out there and fight.

664
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.200
Fight for her.

665
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.840
One thing I've learned
about war is that

666
01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.720
wars aren't won by the few
and exceptional.

667
01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.240
but by the many
and the ordinary.

668
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.480
- You're not ordinary.
- No. Neither are you.

669
01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:45.280
- We're not.
- We're not ordinary.

670
01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.880
- Don't give up.
- No.

671
01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.360
We don't give up.

672
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.760
- We don't give up.
- Don't give up.

673
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.440
I won't give up.

674
01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.000
Look at this.

675
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.960
This is where they were.
Irene and Veslemøy.

676
01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:08.040
I can't guarantee that
they're still there. but... Yeah.

677
01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.000
The number is a few days old.

678
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.920
Your brother...
is he always so correct?

679
01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.880
Do you doubt
that he'll pull this off?

680
01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.160
Fredrik has always been
meticulous and conscientious.

681
01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:05.920
I don't think it's a coincidence
that he was picked to lead this.

682
01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.160
When we were kids.
we couldn't eat grapes

683
01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.600
before he had categorised them
according to size.

684
01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:20.080
colour and consistency.

685
01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.080
It was important
that everyone got the same amount.

686
01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.280
and that could take some time.

687
01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.920
This one.

688
01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.520
Good job. lads.

689
01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.320
- Where's Nini?
- Here she comes.

690
01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.160
JØRGEN AARØ'S FISH TRUCK

691
01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.280
I brought some fish.
so we don't all get goitre.

692
01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.160
- How did it go?
- Two things.

693
01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.000
We made contact with the Brits.

694
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.320
They're going to call.
so someone has to man the phone.

695
01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.080
The other thing...

696
01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.480
I have a new mission.

697
01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:16.200
The government is leaving
the country and needs money.

698
01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:19.840
I'll meet them in Molde
with the paper currency.

699
01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.960
A fish truck
shouldn't raise any alarms.

700
01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.960
There are eight crates
full of banknotes there.

701
01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.800
Be careful.

702
01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.400
You too.

703
01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.040
You know Nini from before?

704
01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.600
The Spanish Civil War.
We saw all kinds of things.

705
01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.240
Right...

706
01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.000
I'll show the Easterners
how to prepare cod.

707
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.800
I don't remember what happened.

708
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.360
No wonder. tough guy.

709
01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.600
It got intense for you
in that passenger carriage.

710
01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:44.480
But while I was about to perish
in the flames with that poet.

711
01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.360
you ended up in the bosom
of a lovely lady

712
01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:50.600
who's more of a man
than you'll ever be.

713
01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.800
I can thank Hitler that the dentist
didn't get to pull that tooth.

714
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.040
It's much better to sit here
with a toothache

715
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.320
and eat cod with you youngsters.

716
01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.960
It's great. That's life for you.

717
01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.880
Haslund?

718
01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:36.560
My English isn't all that great.
but it's them.

719
01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.400
The Brits.

720
01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.640
Yes. this is Haslund.

721
01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.920
I understand.

722
01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.240
Yes.

723
01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.880
Thank you.

724
01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.280
They're pulling out.

725
01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:08.720
- Who's pulling out?
- The Brits. I think.

726
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.600
The last vessel. HMS Glasgow.

727
01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.040
is on its way to Molde to evacuate
the government and the king.

728
01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.360
The ship has room for all the gold.

729
01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.080
The question is
when the king will come.

730
01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.600
Troop! Fall in!

731
01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.840
The work on the train will cease.

732
01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.680
These tracks
won't take us where we're going.

733
01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.320
Our goal now is vehicles.

734
01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.640
We will use anything
that can transport the gold.

735
01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.600
We have to hurry to Molde.

736
01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.400
Come on!

737
01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:01.280
Major Stoltmann.
we are waiting for results.

738
01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:04.200
Are you having trouble
locating the gold transport?

739
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.600
No. don't worry about that.

740
01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.520
You have my word.

741
01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.120
We'll have the gold soon.
Over and out.

742
01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.000
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

743
01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.400
Drive faster!

744
01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:49.960
Mark large crates here.

745
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:54.200
small crates here. and the number
of every single crate.

746
01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.720
The crates will be moved straight
from the train to the lorries!

747
01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.120
Yes. Major.

748
01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.080
We don't have time to register them!

749
01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:10.080
Everyone... please listen to me.

750
01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.960
The glue that holds
this operation together is order.

751
01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:27.280
We have to register
every single crate.

752
01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.800
We can't control
when the Germans will be here.

753
01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.120
We can only control our own actions.

754
01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.360
Thank you for your cooperation.

755
01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:42.120
They're going straight
to the lorries!

756
01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.720
Gentlemen. don't lose heart.

757
01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.200
Remember that this is
a tremendous and rare honour.

758
01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.480
How many times in life

759
01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:16.520
do you get the chance to be right
in the centre of the action.

760
01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.880
and to as an individual be able

761
01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:22.640
to directly impact
the future of our nation?

762
01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:31.840
Walk with your heads held high
where history is being written.

763
01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.800
Lovely words. Grieg.

764
01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.080
Thank you.

765
01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.160
Next. Go ahead.

766
01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.560
Next.

767
01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:17.760
Next.

768
01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:20.800
- 189.
- Thank you. Next.

769
01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.920
Yes. Next.

770
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.240
- It's 398.
- Thank you.

771
01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.040
43.

772
01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:39.080
Come on. Next.

773
01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.560
Come on!

774
01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.440
Drive!

775
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.680
Drive on. Drive!

776
01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.600
Sunde. the next wagon.

777
01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.280
Next lorry. Move along.

778
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.400
Next.

779
01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.760
- Next lorry!
- Thank you.

780
01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.360
Thank you.

781
01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.800
I received a phone call.

782
01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.560
That's the last crate.

783
01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.240
Thank you.

784
01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.840
Haslund.

785
01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.440
- Everything is ready.
- The Germans are closing in.

786
01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.240
The roads are poor. We need a ferry.

787
01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.080
We have to get going.

788
01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.520
Everyone to the vehicles!
We're leaving now!

789
01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.560
I dare say the silence
will soon be broken.

790
01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.720
I have a bad feeling about this.

791
01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.560
The Brits are pulling out.

792
01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:12.080
We're left to fend for ourselves
with the Germans on our heels.

793
01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:16.000
There's probably no ship in Molde.

794
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.240
If you don't have anything positive
to say. it's better if you shut up.

795
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.280
- Maybe they didn't see us.
- That wasn't positive enough.

796
01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:39.440
Is it a convoy of lorries? Over.

797
01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.520
No. just one lorry.
Should we abort the mission?

798
01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:47.240
No. keep going. We're looking
for more than one vehicle.

799
01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.520
They can't have got far.

800
01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.520
Report back. Out.

801
01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.840
Come on!

802
01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.360
Ready!

803
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.240
Come on!

804
01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.480
Damn it!

805
01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:31.480
There has to be a tractor
on that farm.

806
01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.760
Find sticks. Find sticks!

807
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:38.720
One. two. three!

808
01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.040
Get it out!

809
01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.800
I thought you said a tractor.

810
01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:02.760
The horse is nature's own tractor.
But much prettier.

811
01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:06.040
One. two. three. now!

812
01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:42.440
The ferry is on its way.
The convoy is on the other side.

813
01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:45.440
- How many vehicles are left?
- We're only missing one lorry.

814
01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.640
It'll be here soon.

815
01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.440
There's the problem.
The belt has snapped.

816
01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:58.840
Right.

817
01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.440
What the hell do we do now?

818
01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:05.520
There must be some tools here.

819
01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:13.960
You think you'll find a fan belt
in the glove compartment?

820
01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.360
Moron.

821
01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.440
Keep going! Go!

822
01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:39.680
The last lorry probably broke down.
We can't wait any longer.

823
01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.280
Do you hear me?
We have to get across!

824
01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.880
Listen. everyone.

825
01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:48.200
We have to move this bus
off the ferry.

826
01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:51.480
It blocks the way for the lorry
that we have to get on board.

827
01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:56.560
- Move all the crates out of the bus!
- Carrying duty. lads.

828
01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:00.480
Hold this while I tighten it.

829
01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:07.000
Yes. it's hot. It's smoking.
The engine is hot.

830
01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.240
Come on. lads.

831
01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:29.160
Get in. We'll try to start it.

832
01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.320
Give it fuel. Come on.

833
01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:36.440
- Are you stepping on it?
- Yes.

834
01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:41.000
Yes. yes. yes!

835
01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.240
Great. Ingvar!

836
01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.800
Amazing!

837
01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:52.280
Okay. Hey. hey. hey.
We have to get going.

838
01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:59.720
Hey. we have to get going.
Hey... You're on that side.

839
01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:12.560
One positive thing is that we
haven't seen the plane in a while.

840
01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.800
Please don't say anything.

841
01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:17.440
Every time you open your mouth.
something happens.

842
01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:25.840
Haslund! They're here!
We have to go!

843
01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:32.200
- Put out!
- We'll wait for the last lorry.

844
01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:39.160
Put out. I said! Do you see these?
That's an order! Put out!

845
01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:42.200
This isn't about the gold.
It's about our men.

846
01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:45.160
We must sacrifice a few
to save the rest!

847
01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.160
Put out!

848
01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.200
Haslund. get back!

849
01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.160
Go back! Go back!

850
01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.480
Troop. ready your weapons! Take aim!

851
01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.560
On my command! Fire!

852
01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.200
Take cover!

853
01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:00.240
So it's a plane that will reunite me
with my maker.

854
01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.520
I'll be damned.

855
01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.680
Goddamn it! Out!

856
01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.960
That's the end of the road.

857
01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.240
That's it. then.

858
01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.600
Give up?

859
01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:14.840
Never. Lieutenant.

860
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.240
We know they're heading for Molde.

861
01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:26.480
If necessary. the Luftwaffe will
raze the entire city to the ground.

862
01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.200
We must do everything
in our power to prevent

863
01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:33.440
the Norwegians from reaching
the British ships.

864
01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.600
Get me a plane.

865
01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.400
I need to get up there.

866
01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:43.280
I want to see for myself
how this pans out.

867
01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:05.680
- We have to reseal the crates.
- Good.

868
01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:49.200
This is not the work
of friendly hands.

869
01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:51.800
We have to get to the pier.

870
01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.520
Okay. come on!

871
01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.360
Fredrik!

872
01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.320
- Nini!
- You have to hurry.

873
01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:13.160
The ship is only waiting
for the king and the government.

874
01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:16.160
- The king is on his way.
- Same procedure as last time.

875
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.680
Crates. please.

876
01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:21.360
Hey! Hurry up!

877
01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.080
I don't know what to do.

878
01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:27.320
The paper currency is locked
inside the bank vault.

879
01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.320
- Molde Savings Bank?
- Yes.

880
01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:32.800
But we can't open the door.
We have to get it out!

881
01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.520
One thing at a time.

882
01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.640
We have to get the gold on board
before the king arrives.

883
01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:45.520
- Hurry this up.
- Get all the crates on board. now!

884

Here.

886
01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:02.080
Next.

887
01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:04.800
Hurry up!

888
01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.240

Move along!

891
01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:34.800
Come on!

892
01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:45.080
I heard you were here. Good job.

893
01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:57.000
Oh. damn. The king is here.

894
01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:39.120
- Torp. we need more time.
- There's nothing I can do.

895
01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:42.400
What about the gold? It's 18 tonnes.

896
01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.160
You have to keep transporting it.

897
01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.520
Good luck.

898
01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:19.360
Where's Nini?

899
01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:27.440
Sunde. find a boat.
You'll handle the registration.

900
01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:37.880
You!

901
01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.280

Try to kick open the door! Come on!

904
01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:56.800
Nini!

905
01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:01.960
What?

906
01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:05.600
You won't fail your responsibility.
and I won't fail mine.

907
01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.440
I'm not leaving here
without the paper currency.

908
01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:10.080
Do you get that?

909
01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.760
No!

910
01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.280
- We can do this!
- Come on!

911
01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.120
Thank you.

912
01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:26.720
Move along!

913
01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:30.960
Nowhere is safe.
so just finish the job!

914
01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.160
- We can do this!
- We're going home soon.

915
01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.520
Come on.

916
01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:48.120
We won't give up.
We're not giving up.

917
01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:50.320
No. never.

918
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.480
Come on!

919
01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:07.960
Thank you.

920
01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:10.160
Put the crate in front.

921
01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.840
In the back.

922
01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:16.640
Come on!

923
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.200
Again!

924
01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.080
Reload!

925
01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.320
Down in the harbour!

926
01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:38.600
Bombs away! Wipe them out!

927
01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:42.560
Take cover!

928
01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:55.320
Ingvar! Get away!

929
01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:13.440
We can't stay here.

930
01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:16.760
We have to get up.

931
01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:21.280
Stay in cover!
They're coming around!

932
01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:29.800
Come on. now. Come on.

933
01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.280
Come on!

934
01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.240
Ingvar.

935
01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.760
Leave me.

936
01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:47.880
- Ingvar!
- Grieg! Get back!

937
01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:56.680
What the hell's happened to you?

938
01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:02.680
Did you get brave?

939
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:10.880
I think you'll have to manage
the rest of this journey alone.

940
01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:15.160
Don't be so negative. please.
Come on.

941
01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:22.760
Come on!

942
01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:38.720
We have to move that lorry.
Hurry. Move that lorry.

943
01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:43.120
Come on!

944
01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:45.840
- That's the last one! Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

GASOLINE

946
01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.360
We've done all we can here.

947
01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:17.920
We have to move on.

948
01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:20.520
Let's get the gold
back onto the lorries.

949
01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:57.440
Hello.

950
01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:01.720
We come from Oslo.

951
01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.160
They don't know who we are.

952
01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:19.160
They think we're Germans.

953
01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:40.920
I'm Fredrik Haslund. We're here
on behalf of the government.

954
01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:44.640
The central bank of Norway.
We're transporting...

955
01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.880
Norway's gold reserve.

956
01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:50.600
We need to get it further north.

957
01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:53.440
The Germans are after us.

958
01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.120
We need help.

959
01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.800
The lads and I...

960
01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:17.800
We'll help you.

961
01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:22.680
Thank you. I appreciate it.

962
01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:09.160
Below deck!

963
01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:02.600
Lost.

964
01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:05.600
We've lost.

965
01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:15.080
- Fly us home!
- Home?

966
01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:19.240
Yes. all the way home!

967
01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:36.200
- It's safe.
- Good.

968
01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:55.800
That's great.
I'll tell him right away. Thank you.

969
01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:06.840
Irene and Veslemøy
are safe in Sweden.

970
01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:31.720
I've written something
that I would like to read to you.

971
01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:39.200
"Today the flagpole stands naked

972
01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:42.600
Amongst Eidsvoll's trees and greens

973
01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:48.560
But precisely in this hour
We know what freedom means

974
01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:53.440
Over the land. a song is rising

975
01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:56.320
Triumphantly. its words awoke

976
01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.280
Though whispered through closed lips

977
01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:03.480
Under the strangers' yoke

978
01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:07.600
A certainty in us was born then

979
01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:11.680
Freedom and life are dear

980
01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:18.680
As simple. as indispensable
as sucking in air

981
01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:22.720
We felt. when threatened
with bondage

982
01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:26.000
Our lungs were gasping for breath

983
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.280
As if in a sunken U-boat
We will not die such a death

984
01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:36.040
Now we fight
for our right to breathe

985
01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:38.720
For the dawn of the day we grasp

986
01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:45.080
When Norwegians unite
in the same liberated gasp

987
01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:49.000
We parted from kin in the south

988
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.280
From pale. exhausted men

989
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.240
To you. a promise is made

990
01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:59.160
That we shall return again

991
01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:03.200
Here we will remember the dead

992
01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:06.440
Who gave their lives for our peace

993
01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:10.320
The soldier in blood on the snow

994
01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:12.600
The sailor who drowned in the seas

995
01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:19.320
So few we are in our country
We are kin with all our slain

996
01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:23.360
And the dead shall be beside us

997
01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:26.920
The day we return again"

998
01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:33.600
Not too shabby. Grieg.

999
01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:52.800
The last 18 tonnes of gold
arrived in Tromsø on 9 May 1940.

1000
01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:54.680
one month after the invasion.

1001
01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:58.120
From there. it was transported
on the HMS Enterprise to England.

1002
01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:01.320
The gold reserve was then sent
to the US and Canada.

1003
01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:05.280
The gold became important
for the resistance

1004
01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:08.840
of the Norwegian government in exile
and the allied forces.

1005
01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:11.920
and for the rebuilding
of the country after the war.

Hundreds of people
took part in the gold transport.

1007
01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:20.040
many of them volunteers
recruited along the way.

1008
01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:24.200
Their efforts became an inspiration
for the resistance that followed.

1009
01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:31.480
Fredrik Haslund went with the gold
all the way to America.

1010

with Irene and Veslemøy in New York.

1013
01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:43.480
four months after
his "quick trip down to the office".

1014
01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:46.160
Fredrik died in 1961. 62 years old.

In 1991. she received
the Humanist Prize

1021
01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:10.080

with the gold to London.

1022
01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:11.760
He was given the rank of captain

1023

for Norway's freedom

as a war correspondent for Norwegian
radio broadcasts from the BBC.

1025
01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:20.000
The famous poem he wrote
during the gold transport

1026
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.760
was given the title "17 May 1940".

1027
01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:24.760
In December 1943. he took part
in a bombing raid over Berlin.

1030
01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:33.440
In his official report
to the finance minister.

1031
01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:35.680

that everyone who took part
in the gold transport

1033
01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:41.840
should receive an embossed gold coin
from the central bank.

1034
01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:44.640
His wish was never granted.
