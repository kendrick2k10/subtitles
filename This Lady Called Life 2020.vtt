3
00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:17.458
Why don't you use the money
you're making from your customers

4
00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:18.542
to hire a nanny?

5
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.375
Look at this lady.

6
00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:34.417
Right?

7
00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.625
You won't get a nanny
that would help you watch this child.

8
00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:46.167
For what?
Please. I'm late for an exam. sorry.

9
00:04:17.042 --> 00:04:18.250
Omo. how are you?

10
00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:30.333
Mrs Odour...

11
00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:37.667
Is this lady OK?

12
00:11:22.833 --> 00:11:23.750
Thank God.

13
00:11:58.458 --> 00:11:59.958
Which exam?

14
00:12:00.042 --> 00:12:02.000
Why don't you wait
for your mother to wake up?

15
00:12:04.833 --> 00:12:07.208
I should wait for her
to wake up and tell me to leave. right?

16
00:18:23.292 --> 00:18:24.125
Good morning.

17
00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.875
Look. Daddy. me...

18
00:19:53.708 --> 00:19:55.375
Please. I'm begging you.

19
00:19:56.833 --> 00:19:58.333
I'm begging you. you hear me?

20
00:20:20.792 --> 00:20:23.042
-Please. please. my child.
-I have heard you. sir.

21
00:20:23.125 --> 00:20:24.667
I've heard you. sir.

22
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.042
I've heard you.

23
00:22:19.792 --> 00:22:21.708
Look at where you are going.
Please take a seat.

24
00:22:26.708 --> 00:22:28.833
Have you gone mad?

25
00:22:30.542 --> 00:22:32.042
Do your eyes pain you?

26
00:22:32.125 --> 00:22:33.750
You're a fool.

27
00:22:33.833 --> 00:22:35.250
But. Mummy. you're the one
that used your leg to--

28
00:22:36.417 --> 00:22:37.292
Your mother!

29
00:22:38.583 --> 00:22:40.667
You can't be my child. Nuisance.

30
00:22:47.167 --> 00:22:48.208
Sorry. sir.

31
00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:57.583
Look at what she looks like.
You can't be my child.

32
00:22:57.667 --> 00:22:59.958
Get out of my sight. before I kick you!

33
00:23:00.042 --> 00:23:01.458
You can't be my child.
See what she looks like!

34
00:23:01.542 --> 00:23:02.667
She looks like a dead person.

35
00:23:02.792 --> 00:23:04.042
Big dummy.

36
00:23:06.292 --> 00:23:10.167
Useless fool. useless child.

37
00:23:18.208 --> 00:23:19.625
Have you gone mad?

38
00:23:19.708 --> 00:23:21.292
Do your eyes pain you? You're a fool.

39
00:23:21.375 --> 00:23:24.375
You can't be my child.
See what she looks like! Big dummy.

40
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.083
She hasn't been
into this house in four years.

41
00:26:57.708 --> 00:27:00.000
What if you die. what will you tell God?

42
00:29:38.625 --> 00:29:41.250
Don't you want to get well?

43
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.333
Don't come and die in my hands. please.

44
00:32:17.208 --> 00:32:18.125
What's up?

45
00:32:19.167 --> 00:32:20.667
Sorry. traffic. right?

46
00:37:00.458 --> 00:37:02.583
Yam flour has finished. Jesus.

47
00:39:00.667 --> 00:39:01.958
Hey. guy. what's happening?

48
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.292
I'm trying to eat.

49
00:39:14.625 --> 00:39:16.708
Then keep calm.
you'll see me soon.

50
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:51.292
Jesus Christ.

51
00:39:54.542 --> 00:39:55.625
Jesus Christ.

52
00:40:02.625 --> 00:40:03.500
I'm OK.

53
00:41:35.333 --> 00:41:36.167
Right?

54
00:42:24.958 --> 00:42:25.833
Hey. what's up?

55
00:42:40.333 --> 00:42:41.292
Please.

56
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.500
Babysit?
Yoruba people babysit as well?

57
00:47:01.542 --> 00:47:03.083
Hey. what's up?

58
00:47:08.083 --> 00:47:09.875
Just help me hold down one spot.
Please.

59
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:38.208
Look here.

60
00:59:42.667 --> 00:59:46.125
Keep deceiving yourself. not me.

61
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.250
We shall see where all this ends.

62
00:59:51.333 --> 00:59:52.167
Sure.

63
01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:15.458
But you as well.

64
01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:06.833
Fine girl. come here.

65
01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:22.000
"You mustn't follow men.

66
01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:24.125
You mustn't have a boyfriend!
You mustn't--

67
01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:25.792
You can't follow any boy.
you mustn't have any boyfriend.

68
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:18.458
You must really like this song.

69
01:13:56.542 --> 01:13:57.417
Please. please. please.

70
01:16:10.708 --> 01:16:12.667
Ah! Really?

71
01:16:54.333 --> 01:16:55.625
Good day. Ma.

72
01:17:03.042 --> 01:17:04.042
Serial cheat.

73
01:17:05.417 --> 01:17:07.292
Big fool.

74
01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.167
You'll soon come home pregnant.

75
01:17:15.208 --> 01:17:17.000
Joseph will soon have a junior sibling.

76
01:17:17.083 --> 01:17:18.708
Look at how you throw yourself at a man.

77
01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:20.708
Shameless fellow.

78
01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:22.583
Dumb person.

79
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:26.042
You. this local fellow. long fool.

80
01:17:27.792 --> 01:17:29.042
You prostitute.

81
01:17:29.542 --> 01:17:32.792
You. this empty barrel.
You. this empty barrel.

82
01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:35.167
Promiscuous fellow.

83
01:17:36.333 --> 01:17:38.125
Nonsense.

84
01:17:38.583 --> 01:17:39.708
Fool.

85
01:17:40.583 --> 01:17:42.750
You're better off dead.

86
01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:44.583
You have met the wrong person.

87
01:17:45.292 --> 01:17:48.708
Look here.
I pity you. you think he will marry you?

88
01:17:48.792 --> 01:17:52.083
Look at him. he is a time waster. Fool.

89
01:17:52.208 --> 01:17:54.542
Do you think he will marry you?
I pity you.

90
01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:59.292
When you're done creating the problem.
who will solve it?

91
01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:00.708
It can't be me.

92
01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.042
Nonsense.

93
01:18:06.125 --> 01:18:07.042
Nonsense.

94
01:18:10.583 --> 01:18:11.792
Respectfully. Ma.

95
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:14.875
Aiye is not a useless child.

96
01:18:55.792 --> 01:18:57.500
Aiye is a good girl
and she has a bright future.

97
01:19:02.458 --> 01:19:03.375
Goodbye. Ma.

98
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:01.958
My boss.

99
01:20:10.708 --> 01:20:12.333
What are you saying?

100
01:27:26.292 --> 01:27:27.125
Bad child.

101
01:27:46.917 --> 01:27:48.083
What is going on?

102
01:27:48.167 --> 01:27:50.667
Toke. I will slap you.

103
01:27:56.542 --> 01:28:00.292
Don't try it or I'll
push you down! I'll push you down. Ma!

104
01:29:31.917 --> 01:29:32.750
What is she saying?

105
01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:22.958
I begged you.

106
01:31:16.958 --> 01:31:18.583
Thank you. Ma. goodbye.

107
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.292
Please help me. Mummy.

108
01:39:56.333 --> 01:39:57.500
Please come.

109
01:42:51.792 --> 01:42:53.167
Let us go and eat.

110
01:43:15.583 --> 01:43:17.708
Go and eat. OK. sorry.

111
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:22.833
I'm coming. OK.

112
01:45:36.792 --> 01:45:39.167
Omo. you come with a lot of troubles.

113
01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.083
What sort of problem is this?

114
01:47:00.083 --> 01:47:03.833
Is it amala I will be selling till I die?
Why is my life like this?

115
01:47:18.625 --> 01:47:21.667
Why is my life like this? Why?

116
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:30.917
Yes. Ma.

117
01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:08.958
I would say they are lying.

118
01:50:32.792 --> 01:50:34.833
The child that I threw away.

119
01:50:50.667 --> 01:50:53.583
Ungrateful.

120
01:51:04.833 --> 01:51:06.792
The king that no one gave birth to.

121
01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.750
The God that gives blessings.

122
01:51:11.833 --> 01:51:13.167
My first child.

123
01:51:53.792 --> 01:51:55.042
This. my breast...

124
01:51:57.333 --> 01:51:59.292
I will use it to pray for you.

125
01:52:03.417 --> 01:52:05.333
Your husband's house
will not be uncomfortable for you.

126
01:52:09.542 --> 01:52:11.542
Your path will not be destroyed.

127
01:52:15.292 --> 01:52:17.375
You will succeed.

128
01:52:18.875 --> 01:52:20.583
You will prosper.

129
01:52:22.375 --> 01:52:26.875
I bless the day you were born.

130
01:52:27.542 --> 01:52:31.042
You will not

131
01:52:31.125 --> 01:52:35.458
suffer.

132
01:52:39.208 --> 01:52:43.500
May God help you in all your endeavours.

133
01:52:44.792 --> 01:52:47.250
You will not lack anything.

134
01:52:47.333 --> 01:52:51.458
Your husband's house
will not be uncomfortable for you.

135
01:52:51.542 --> 01:52:56.500
May everyone favour you.

136
01:52:57.042 --> 01:52:59.750
May you be accepted.

137

138
01:53:05.167 --> 01:53:08.375
It is well with you.

139
