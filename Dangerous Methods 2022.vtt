00:10:46.647 --> 00:10:49.263
In this town. everybody's got to
act their asses off to survive.

184
00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:51.107
I know this stuff
tastes like crap.

185
00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.601
I only drink it
because of the screen.

186
00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:56.279
Got it.

187
00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:57.781
Speaking of the screen.

188
00:10:57.908 --> 00:11:00.116
do you understand
what we're doing here?

189
00:11:00.243 --> 00:11:01.368
Yeah. Well. I know that
you want to do

190
00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:03.277
some preparation
for your next role.

191
00:11:03.372 --> 00:11:04.829
Preparation's cute.

192
00:11:04.915 --> 00:11:06.498
I prefer immersion.

193
00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.166
Immersion?

194
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:11.127
Yeah. I have to immerse myself
in my character. Lennox.

195
00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:13.672
So Desmond disappears.

196
00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:16.341
See. the audience has to forget
every other role

197
00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:17.926
that I've ever played.

198
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.469
Wow.

199
00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:22.180
Yeah. This is going to be
the role of a lifetime.

200
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:40.907
[sighs]

201
00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:59.000
I love this picture of mom.

202
00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:00.719
Yeah.

203
00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:03.012
Million dollar smile.

204
00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.931
Do you think I have her smile?

205
00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.391
Of course you do.

206
00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:07.842
You've got quite a few
of her qualities.

207
00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:11.512
Really? Like what?

208
00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.566
Her eyes.
Her skin.

209
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:17.068
Unfortunately.
you're cursed with my nose.

210
00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:23.032
I'm going to move
to Los Angeles.

211
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.527
Not today.
not tomorrow.

212
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:29.247
-Not for ten years.
-Five.

213
00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:31.374
Eight.

214
00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:32.917
I made a promise to her.

215
00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:37.088
She loved Arizona
but she missed Cali.

216
00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:40.133
I know.

217
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.510
I love you. coach.

218
00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.514
I love you. too.
And your nose.

219
00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:42.278
[chuckles]

220
00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.459
[sighs]

221
00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:57.710
Wow.

222
00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.130
[sighs]

223
00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:06.219
[knocking]

224
00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:07.470
Lacy?

225
00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:15.937
-Uh. um...
-Shh. it's okay.

226
00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.272
It's just me.

227
00:14:18.275 --> 00:14:19.941
Uh. sorry.

228
00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:25.238
Did...
Did you need something?

229
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.784
You said you're
from Arizona. right?

230
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.620
-Yeah?
-Well...

231
00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:36.040
I was thinking about giving my
character an Arizona backstory.

232
00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.492
Okay.

233
00:14:38.587 --> 00:14:41.838
So I need to know how
they kiss over there.

234
00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.831
[chuckles]
Um... I...

235
00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:47.427
I imagine that it's just
like everywhere else.

236
00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:50.221
Oh. come on.
I'm being serious now.

237
00:14:50.307 --> 00:14:54.008
There's so many
different variations.

238
00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:55.351
Like. intensity...

239
00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:57.896
And wetness.

240
00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:00.023
Passion.

241
00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:02.358
And flavor.

242
00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:04.819
Flavor?

243
00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:06.487
Yeah. you know?

244
00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:10.241
Come on. don't be modest.

245
00:15:10.327 --> 00:15:13.870
I know you just kissed
hundreds of guys.

246
00:15:13.997 --> 00:15:17.749
Actually I... I've just been
so focused on my future.

247
00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:19.334
I really...

248
00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:22.253
You're so funny.

249
00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:23.755
So tell me...

250
00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:26.716
Is this authentic?

251
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.399
[panting]

252
00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:46.486
[chuckles]

253
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.864
[laughs]

254
00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:12.253
[sighs]

255
00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:14.514
No. no. no.

256
00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:17.475
Please. take my health.
but don't take my service.

257
00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:21.980
Ugh. damn it.

258
00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:24.983
Sucks.

259
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:42.917
[chuckles]

260
00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:46.504
Well. good morning.

261
00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:49.957
Good morning. Sleepyhead.

262
00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:51.292
What are you making?

263
00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:54.846
My favorites. banana flapjacks.

264
00:16:54.931 --> 00:16:57.465
I learned how to make these
from a Brazilian chef

265
00:16:57.559 --> 00:17:00.643
who put his own divine
twist on a French recipe.

266
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.970
That sounds amazing. actually.

267
00:17:03.064 --> 00:17:04.638
You have no idea.

268
00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:07.775
One time in Rio de Janeiro
I ate six of these

269
00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:09.819
-in one sitting.
-Nice.

270
00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:13.322
Oh. that reminds me before
I forget I have your pills here.

271
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.700
So let me just
get two of them for you.

272
00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:18.319
Thank you.

273
00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:19.912
These are a lifesaver.

274
00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:25.543
Hmm.

275
00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:26.878
Mmm.

276
00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:32.008
So. how did it go last night?

277
00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:34.177
Um. good. I think.

278
00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:36.054
You mean. you can't tell?

279
00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:37.930
Not until the dailies.

280
00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:39.807
Like I said.
I'm no longer Desmond.

281
00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:44.353
Can I ask
what's the movie about?

282
00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:46.689
Oh. oh.

283
00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:48.015
You'll have to try this.

284
00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:49.901
Oh. okay.

285
00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:52.779
-Mmm.
-Mm-hmm.

286
00:17:52.864 --> 00:17:54.072
Aren't they lit?

287
00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:57.024
-So good.
-Right?

288
00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:59.243
Oh yeah. I can't believe
you made those. you know.

289
00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:01.454
I feel like
I should be making these you.

290
00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:02.413
You don't want all
of them. though?

291
00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:03.873
No. no. no.

292
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.865
Are you sure?
I don't want to take...

293
00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:06.250
Oh. okay.

294
00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:18.387
So. you know. I do
follow you on social media.

295
00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:21.724
200 Bucks says that I know where
this conversation is going.

296
00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:26.771
You want to know
if the rumors are true.

297
00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:30.775
I mean. if we had service.
I would totally Venmo you.

298
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.894
I just love how you Gen Z brains

299
00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:38.407
get all lit up at the prospect
of any frivolous meme.

300
00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:41.402
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

301
00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:42.787
Is that... is that
really all it was?

302
00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.539
Just a meme?

303
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.754
No.

304
00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:54.340
No. not this.

305
00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:56.300
Really?

306
00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.588
His name is Philippe.

307
00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:02.181
We met when I was on vacation.

308
00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:04.142
He was a barman
on a cruise ship.

309
00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:06.185
-No way!
-Yeah. way.

310
00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:12.608
I get so tired of hiding.

311
00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:15.945
Hollywood can be so suffocating.

312
00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.613
This is crazy.

313
00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:21.275
I'll let you know...

314
00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:22.610
I mean. I...

315
00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:24.954
I grew up watching
you all the time.

316
00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:28.624
And I would have never known.

317
00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:31.294
Well. it's not like
we all wear pink.

318
00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:34.005
Look. it's not something
that you can really tell.

319
00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:37.175
I mean. obviously not.
I couldn't tell.

320
00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:44.298
But... but you were engaged
to that Italian actress. right?

321
00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.967
-Mirabella Anatusa?
-Yes.

322
00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:49.061
That was a lifetime ago.

323
00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:53.024
I was very young and
very confused.

324
00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:56.986
But look. it's not like I can't
appreciate the female form.

325
00:19:57.113 --> 00:19:59.947
But truth be told.

326
00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:02.074
Sharon choreographed
every step of that.

327
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.534
all the way to the altar.

328
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.038
-No. she didn't?
-She did. Every detail.

329
00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:09.665
She would always say.

330
00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:13.878
Look. kid. it's the facade
that pays the bills.

331
00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:15.713
And she's right.

332
00:20:15.798 --> 00:20:19.008
I just don't think that my fans
would fall for a gay Romeo.

333
00:20:20.637 --> 00:20:22.386
Well. you never know.

334
00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:24.004
Look. I know
it's a backwards thought.

335
00:20:24.098 --> 00:20:26.224
But back then.
it seemed to make more sense.

336
00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:30.344
Wow. I just
I cannot believe that

337
00:20:30.438 --> 00:20:33.105
she faked an entire wedding.

338
00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:34.815
Oh. believe it.

339
00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:36.859
You'd be smart
to learn from her.

340
00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:39.946
She's very good
at managing my career.

341
00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:42.073
I guess so.

342
00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:43.741
Are you ready? Set?

343
00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:44.784
-What?
-Go.

344
00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:46.827
But...

345
00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:48.537
Hey. wait up.

346
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:53.751
Desmond?

347
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:56.754
Desmond!

348
00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:00.049
Where are you?

349
00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:03.261
[sighs]

350
00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:10.184
Desmond.

351
00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:19.986
[cat meows]

352
00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:54.937
[phone vibrates]

353
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:06.490
Hello?

354
00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:08.284
Hey. Coach. it's me.

355
00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:10.536
Lacy. where are you?

356
00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:12.038
Oh. I'm in the mountains
for work.

357
00:22:12.123 --> 00:22:14.457
There's no signal here.

358
00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:16.459
That sounds isolated.

359
00:22:16.586 --> 00:22:18.127
I think that's kind
of the purpose.

360
00:22:18.254 --> 00:22:20.713
Have you got a number
I can contact you on?

361
00:22:21.758 --> 00:22:24.342
I have an unknown here.

362
00:22:24.427 --> 00:22:28.804
It's actually...
it's better if I just call you.

363
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:30.631
Like you did yesterday?
