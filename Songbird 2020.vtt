Because any day.

It's next on my list.

71
00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:34.225
"Priority" means
it's first on your list.

72
00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.855
Lester. it's all the way
across town.

73
00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:37.232
Hold up.

74
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.570
Are you at the court?

75
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.191
Uh... no.

76
00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:43.980
I have GPS.

77
00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.899
Then maybe.

78
00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:48.819
Make a three for Kobe
and get going.

79
00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.287
Hi. guys.
What's up? This is larray.

80
00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.831
My best friend
didn't pass his thermal scan

81
00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.501
and the department of sanitation
took him to the q-zone.

82
00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.547
So. I'm worried. 'cause once you go
to the q-zone. you don't ever leave.

83
00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.434
Good morning. Marie.

84
00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.388
Good morning. senora.

85
00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.122

in the kitchen.

86
00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.512

87
00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.194

God. kid.

89
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.277
I have a question for you. Yes?

90
00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:26.781
So. I was wondering
about the whole Ellie thing.

91
00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:28.317
Yeah. what about it?

92
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.703
So. her mom says that it's fine

93
00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:35.866
if she comes and hangs out
for a little while.

94
00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.626
I'm sorry. You know
we can't have people over.

95
00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:41.038
All we're... not to
mention. it is illegal.

96
00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.002
What are you gonna do?

97
00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.632
Call sanitation
on two 12-year-olds?

98
00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.129
Have them take us to the zone?

99
00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:49.046
You keep pushing it. and
you might just find out.

100
00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.805
Piper: Did you take
your vitamins?

101
00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:52.386
Yes. mom.
Do you have your inhaler?

102
00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:54.973
Uh-huh. Okay. you're up.

103

Straight a's. Have a great day.

107
00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.428
So please go tell your dad it's
time to take the temp test.

108
00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:12.239
Dad! Mom said it's time
for your temp test!

109
00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.245
I could have done that.

110
00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.727
Female reporter: By order of
the mayor. who stated martial law

111
00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.208
shall remain in place
for the foreseeable future.

112
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.745
Today. the department of
sanitation announced the opening

113
00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:24.164
of a new q-zone
in boyle heights.

114
00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:27.834
The facility would be the fifth of
its kind established in the city

115
00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:30.675
despite recent controversy
over a leaked report

116
00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.761
describing conditions
in these zones as barbaric.

117
00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.830
Automated female voice:
Virus check must be completed.

118
00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:37.094

123
00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.533

we're just fish in a bowl to him?

129
00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.741
Automated female voice:

130
00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:38.788

Really. thank you.

134
00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.792
Go this way.

135
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.882
Yo. yo. yo!
Checking in per usual.

136
00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.806
New strain. new year.
Isn't that great?

137
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:03.097
Looks like this one'll
kill you quick.

138
00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:06.732
They're saying people who are catching
this are dropping dead within 48 hours.

139
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.526
Yesterday I saw
a 10-year-old girl

140
00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:15.825
getting dragged from her house
and taken to the q-zone.

141
00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.699
Well. we know
what the "q" stands for.

142
00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:20.955
"Quick death.”

143
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.075
All I'm saying is.
if you see those guys

144
00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:26.961
in those big-ass yellow suits
coming up your block.

145
00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.872
you better hide
your little sister.

146
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.924
Good evening. miss Garcia.

147
00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.175
Still on for date night?

148
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.306
Oh. every night.
You can't get rid of me.

149
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.102
You're such a stalker.

150
00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:44.417
Yeah. well. it's easy when my
victim can't leave her home.

151
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:45.721
You're not missing
much out here.

152
00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.227
Yeah. except for that view.

153
00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:49.560
Oh. you like that?

154
00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:54.314
This is my view. though. I think
mine's better. Say hi. lita.

155
00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:56.028
Hola. Nico. Como estas?

156
00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.863

Estoy bien. y tu?

159
00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:06.535
Nico. please don't fall.
I'm not gonna fall.

160
00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:09.474
If I did. I wonder how long it would
take someone to find me out here.

161
00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.418
Are you kidding?

162
00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:14.585
Lester would have a cleanup crew
there in. like. 10 minutes. tops.

163
00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:17.630
"Because a dead
courier is bad for business."

164
00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.745
I sounded
just like him. didn't 1?

165
00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.556
I'll see you later. stupid.
I miss you.

166
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.311
Give me an hour.

167
00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:27.564
I got one more drop-off
I'm late for.

168
00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.520
I'm not going anywhere.

169
00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:54.294
Lester: Dozer. I need eyes
on one of my couriers.

170
00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.377
High and tight. High and tight.

171
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:10.690
Hello.

Yeah. Piper. um. it's Steve.
Gwen's husband.

173
00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:15.445
You did that save the rhino
thing for us a few years back.

174
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.823
Oh. yeah.
That was a great party.

175
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.400
What can I do for you?

176
00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:21.818
We. um...

177
00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:24.829
We wanna take a trip
beyond the city limits.

178
00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:26.614
Heard you might have the hookup.

179
00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:29.330
Something to help us
get past the checkpoints.

180
00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:32.120
Party will cost you 300 grand.

181
00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:33.504
Done.

182
00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.711
Okay. great.
Well. we'll be in touch.

183
00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:49.763
Female newscaster: Three apartment
buildings in Van nuys were condemned today

184
00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:52.273
after a number of residents
failed their daily virus check.

185
00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:54.809
A spokesperson for the
department of sanitation

186
00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.070
issued a response
to the outbreak

187
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.573

completely overwhelmed by the caseload

188
00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:03.530
and reminding citizens
that covid is airborne.

189
00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:06.617
No one should leave their home
for any reason.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.830
Male courier 3:
Closed down in echo park.

191
00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.545
Dozer: I have eyes
on the target.

192
00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:20.051
Repeat. I have eyes
on the target.

193
00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:32.851
What...

194
00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.243
Stop! Show us your hands.
Hey. whoa. whoa! I'm immune!

195
00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:47.331
Get on the ground! Now!

196
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.780
I'm immune!

197
00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.186
Checkpoint guard:
He's got a bracelet.

198
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.871
Guy's immune. Have him walk on.

199
00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:56.004
Wow. You gotta be kidding me.

200
00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.174
You guys really need to work
on your people skills.

201
00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:01.001
No loitering. Oh. I'm sorry.
Am I holding up the line?

202
00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:03.044
Keep it moving. you munie scum.

203
00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:04.554
Yeah. keep your mask on.

204
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.136
Don't take that mask off.

205
00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:12.769
It's your boy Adam w.

206
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:16.809
Hey. check it out. So today. I want to
shout out all of our immune workers.

207
00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.567
You mythical creatures.
you legends.

208
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:22.481
So. these munies live alone.
Total isolation.

209
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.154
Talk about social distancing.

210
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:27.865
And the whole time
they're out there.

211
00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.404
they're getting coated in covid.

212
00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:31.989
It's in their hair.
their clothes.

213
00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:35.456
And as one guy put it to me.
that shit sticks.

214
00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.839
They can't go near
friends or family.

215
00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.206
'cause they might get them sick.

216
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:45.095
Remember that the next time you're pining
for one of those yellow bracelets.

217
00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.229
Good as new.

218
00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:04.071
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

219
00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.533
Thank you. Mrs. Griffin.

220
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.953
Nico: Spoke to
my buddy in big sur again.

221
00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.184
He says they haven't had
a case in six months.

222
00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:36.437
Sara: If only we could
get out of the city.

223
00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:39.690
Nico: I'm still putting feelers
out to get black-market passes.

224
00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:42.352
No hits yet.
but once we have those.

225
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.897
I quarantine for three weeks
and then we're gone.

226
00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:48.157
Sara: Hey. at least
you got your ride back.

227
00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.535
Nico: More deliveries a day
means more money to save.

228
00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:54.869
Who would have thought Lester's gets
is actually good at getting things?

229
00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.453
Nico: The man
doesn't disappoint.

230
00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:04.174
Tomorrow. Nico and cielito
will ride again.

231
00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:07.427
I still can't believe you named
that sick-ass bike cielito.

232
00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:09.053
I know. it's great. right?

233
00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:10.463
No.

234
00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.224
There she is.

235
00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:16.010
Sara: Your one true love.

236
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:17.725
Here. check this out.

237
00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:21.690
Sara: Hey. your garden's
not dead.

238
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.022
Give it time.

239
00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:26.133
God. I swear all I do is
love and nurture these things

240
00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:27.363
and all they do is die on me.

241
00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:29.819
We should take 'em
with us when we leave.

242
00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:32.568
Lita has green fingers.

243
00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:35.238
Oh. we're getting lita
her own place. by the way.

244
00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:37.327
Are we? Uh. yeah.

245
00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.502
I figure we have a lot of
lost time to make up for.

246
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.190
and we're not gonna want
a chaperone. are we?

247
00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:42.624
I'm telling her you said that.

248
00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.335
Do not tell her I said that.
I am.

249
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:45.749
You know I'm terrified of her.

250
00:14:45.927 --> 00:14:47.212
That's why I'm telling her.

251
00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:38.392
Bingo.

252
00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:43.723
Hey. guys. It's me. may.
This is may sings the blues.

253
00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:45.857
I'm a struggling
singer-songwriter

254
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.256
who still remembers
the good old days

255
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.049
when we could still listen
to music all together.

256
00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:50.904
So. you can make any requests

257
00:15:51.075 --> 00:15:53.157
and you can hit "like"
if you like what you hear

258
00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:55.363
and maybe even subscribe.

259
00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:56.903
So. what's next?

260
00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.072
Let's lighten the mood
a little bit.

261
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.869
Vanilla ice? No.
that's the wrong stream. buddy.

262
00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:10.341
Mdo0239 says.

263
00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:11.918
"I remember you
played a great cover

264
00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.469
"of American pie once.

265
00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:18.633
"Your songs got me through some rough
days when I was in the military."

266
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.442
Well. md.

267
00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:30.524
this one is for you
and the boys.

268
00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:35.992
Take a deep breath.
everything will be all right

269
00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:39.825
leave your fears
on the battlefield

270
00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:43.082
find your strength
and let it take the wheel

271
00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:47.495
take a deep breath.
everything will be all right

272
00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:51.666
one step back. two steps forward

273
00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:54.335
and the beat of your heart
gets stronger

274
00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:57.551
one step back.
two steps forward...

275
00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.534
Lita: Ooh. ooh!

276
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.372
You still got it. I see you.

277
00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:44.514
Got a special

278

284
00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:14.374
You stole them. Nicholas James.

285
00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.338
How did I steal 'em?
There's nobody around.

286
00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:18.240
They're just sitting there.
but if you don't want 'em...

287

No. no. Give me. give me.

Oh. my god.

291
00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:33.642
I could kiss you right now.

292
00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:37.446
Yeah. well. someday.

293
00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:43.073
The way I figure. by the time I'm
87 and you're. what is it. 84.

294
00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:44.908
we should have
enough put away...

295
00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:47.042
Shut up... to buy passes
and get out of the city.

296
00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:48.449
I'm serious.

297
00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:51.168
It's a dream.

298
00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:55.209
Oh. shit. Lester's calling me.

299
00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:56.669
I'm gonna add him in.

300
00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:00.969
Nico: What's up. boss?

301
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.380
What the hell are you doing?

302
00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:03.715
Don't you have somewhere to be?

303
00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:06.012
Like a high-priority drop
on the westside?

304
00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:07.677
I'm on it. Say hi to Sara.

305
00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:09.015
Hey. Lester.

306
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.226
Stop distracting

307
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.936
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
wait. wait. wait.

308
00:19:13.027 --> 00:19:14.307
Did you just say.
"best courier"?

309
00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:20.899
Well. you heard the man.

310
00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:22.908
I gotta get going. Yep.

311

I'll call you tonight?

312
00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:28.977
I don't know. I think I have
to check my busy schedule.

313
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:31.162
but I think I can make it work.

You miss it. dozer.
the way things were?

325
00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:02.254
I was on lockdown

326
00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:04.130
long before it was fashionable.

327
00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:06.716
How come?

328
00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.557
When I got back from the war.

329
00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:11.955
people didn't want
to talk about it.

330
00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:13.890
You're a vet in a wheelchair.
people are...

331
00:21:14.064 --> 00:21:16.350
They see you. they put their
face right in their phones.

332
00:21:16.525 --> 00:21:18.845
They don't want to... they don't
want to have to face that.

333
00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.820
Somewhere down the line. I just

334
00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:26.566
stopped going out.

335
00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:29.652
For how long?

336
00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:31.867
It's. uh...

337
00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:34.949
It's coming up on six years.

338
00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:39.829
Wow. You're a pro at lockdowns.

339
00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:42.498
This must be a cakewalk for you.

340
00:21:42.676 --> 00:21:46.510
I don't know about a
cakewalk. for anybody. but

341
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.264
having Max... I mean.
Max here is my eyes and ears.

342
00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:53.300
Hey. Max.

343
00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:55.765
Is it as bad as it seems
out there?

344
00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:59.852
It's worse. It's way worse.

345
00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:02.689
But it pays the bills.

346
00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:07.906
Man in film: $3.000. It might
as well have been 3 million.

347
00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:11.155
Woman: What's the matter
with you tonight?

348
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.321
You look like
you lost your last friend.

349
00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:14.705
How'd you like to go to...

350
00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:16.490
I feel like I'm at the theater.

351
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:19.502
Yeah. you kinda
have to squint a little.

352
00:22:19.672 --> 00:22:22.505
but. I mean. it's basically
like mann's Chinese out here.

353
00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:24.123
Hmm.

354
00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:25.958
That was my favorite one.

355
00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:28.798
You know I used to go there every
Friday for matinees. right?

356
00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:33.595
Do you think that maybe we were
there for the same showings?

357
00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:37.512
I did remember seeing this really hot
girl that I was too scared to talk to.

358
00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:40.230
You're full of shit.

359
00:22:40.401 --> 00:22:42.733
Where did you get the projector?

360
00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:44.609
Another score
from the old office.

361
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.362
You really emptied
that place out. huh?

362
00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:49.899
Oh. there's nothing left.
Everything's here.

363
00:22:50.077 --> 00:22:52.159
I could make a law firm
out of my house right now.

364
00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:55.913
I have paper. paper clips. binders.
highlighters. a hole punch.

365
00:22:56.083 --> 00:22:58.199
I have a fax machine.
A fax machine?

366
00:22:58.377 --> 00:22:59.742
Yeah. my mom would be proud.

367
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.680
She always said I'd end
up running the joint.

368
00:23:03.132 --> 00:23:04.963
Can you see that?

369
00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:06.319
Woman in film: There'll be
thousands of dollars there.

370
00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:08.254
Actually. now that
you mention it.

371
00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:11.116
would you mind telling the guy in front
if he could please remove his hat?

372
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.505
This guy right here?

373
00:23:16.145 --> 00:23:17.225
Is that better?

374
00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:21.055
Hey. lita. you wanna
watch with us?

375
00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:40.096
Go back to your room
and I'll bring you medicine. okay?

376
00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:46.664
Is she sick?

377
00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:54.717
Automated female voice: Stay in your homes.
We are here to help.

378
00:23:54.892 --> 00:23:57.508
Please remain in your homes.

379
00:23:57.686 --> 00:24:00.769
Your safety is our priority.

380
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.807
If you attempt to leave your
home. you will be shot on sight.

381
00:24:09.657 --> 00:24:11.193
Please remain in your homes.

382
00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:13.779
What are you doing here?
Who's asking?

383
00:24:13.953 --> 00:24:15.597
Automated female voice:
Lockdown is still in effect.

387
00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:41.014
What are you doing?

388
00:24:41.188 --> 00:24:42.894
Just bring it in.

389
00:24:43.065 --> 00:24:44.601
Get away from me!

390
00:24:48.112 --> 00:24:52.230
Sanitation man: Dos is on-site. Standing
down. Heading to next callout. Over.

391
00:24:59.581 --> 00:25:01.393

Break it in. guys.

394
00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:09.208
Harland: Hey. guys. guys!

395
00:25:09.383 --> 00:25:11.089
It's the wrong apartment.

396
00:25:13.262 --> 00:25:16.800
I said 3-2. 32. Can you read?

397
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.556
Department of sanitation.

398
00:25:19.727 --> 00:25:21.433
They're coming for Alice.

399
00:25:21.603 --> 00:25:23.594
Just break it down.

400
00:25:23.772 --> 00:25:26.058
Mrs. Grant.

401
00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:31.352
Alice and William Grant? This is
the department of sanitation.

402
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.693
By the power granted to me
by the city of Los Angeles.

403
00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:38.109

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.866

Sara. do not open that door.

407
00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:50.875
Do not open that door.

408
00:25:52.634 --> 00:25:54.215
I'm coming over right now.

409
00:25:55.179 --> 00:25:57.591
Please! Please help me!

410
00:25:57.765 --> 00:25:59.005
Nico. please hurry.

411
00:26:02.978 --> 00:26:04.764
Alice: Stop! No! Please!

412
00:26:06.899 --> 00:26:09.857
Somebody help me. please!
Somebody help me!

413
00:26:10.027 --> 00:26:11.233
Get off Mel

414
00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:21.201
Alice: Somebody. please!

415
00:26:28.045 --> 00:26:29.956
I know you're in there.

416
00:26:34.843 --> 00:26:35.958
Hello.

417
00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:38.548
Are you Ms. Garcia?

418
00:26:40.182 --> 00:26:43.174
I'm terribly sorry to inform you

419
00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:48.266
including your poor neighbor.

420
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.312
Maybe a glass of wine
with. uh. Mrs. Grant?

421
00:26:53.737 --> 00:26:56.194
Like. a little gossip?
A little talk?

422
00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:58.230
Breaking the lockdown?

423
00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:02.075
No. we follow the rules here.

424
00:27:02.246 --> 00:27:06.615
You wouldn't believe how many
times I've gotten that answer.

425
00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:10.330
And before you know if.
I'm back at the same address.

426
00:27:10.504 --> 00:27:11.744
That's...

427
00:27:11.922 --> 00:27:13.412
Yeah. you know. it's...

428
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:20.086
Disobedience is. like.
spreading like a tornado.

429
00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:23.346
Well. don't forget your
tempcheck in the morning.

430
00:27:23.517 --> 00:27:26.975
And remember. stay safe.
sane and sanitized.

431
00:28:10.898 --> 00:28:13.389
No! No. you have to
stay away from me.

432
00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:18.575
Please.
just let me help you. okay?

433
00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:32.407
For all we know.
it's just a cold. lita.

434
00:28:34.504 --> 00:28:37.587
No. Sara. stay away from me.

435
00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:49.223
Hey. I just got here.
How is she?

436
00:28:49.811 --> 00:28:50.811
She's not good.

437
00:28:51.355 --> 00:28:52.435
She has a fever.

438
00:28:52.606 --> 00:28:54.346
Oh. shit.

439
00:28:59.488 --> 00:29:01.524
Temp test is at 9:00 A.M.. Nico.

440
00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:06.032
Okay.

441
00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:10.078
They'll take us both.
You know that. right?

442
00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:13.703
They'll take both her and me.

443
00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:16.038
Sara...

444
00:29:17.631 --> 00:29:18.666
Hey. hey.

445
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.081
No one's taking you from me.

446
00:29:26.682 --> 00:29:29.264
She needs me. You should go.
okay? It's not safe here.

447
00:29:29.893 --> 00:29:30.893
Yeah. right.

448
00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:36.847
I'm not going anywhere.

449
00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:39.391
Thank you.

450
00:29:53.959 --> 00:29:55.824
Piper: Breaking curfew?
Oh. Jesus.

451
00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:05.626
Harland needs to see me.

452
00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:07.635
Oh. does he? Yeah.

453
00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:09.216
Mm.

454
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.512
He has those passes
that we need.

455
00:30:13.061 --> 00:30:14.301
Mmm.

456
00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:19.852
So may I leave?

457
00:30:21.028 --> 00:30:23.610
You know. every time
you open that door.

458
00:30:23.697 --> 00:30:26.154
you risk letting in
what's out there.

459
00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:29.863
Yeah. I know. I also know
that it is the only way

460
00:30:30.037 --> 00:30:32.198
that we are keeping
a roof over our heads.

461
00:30:32.372 --> 00:30:34.954
Those are your words.
not mine. Jesus.

462
00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:38.959
Piper. uh. you think
I want to go out there?

463
00:30:39.546 --> 00:30:41.207
I think you love it.

464
00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:48.715
And just because you wear that
bracelet. doesn't make it true.

465
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:50.675
So be a good boy

466
00:30:50.766 --> 00:30:55.351
and burn that sleek
little outfit of yours

467
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.102
before you come
back into the house.

468
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.370
Nico?

469
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.545
Nico?

470
00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:30.214
I'm here.

471
00:31:31.264 --> 00:31:32.879
She's sleeping.

472
00:31:34.768 --> 00:31:36.224
She needs to rest.

473
00:31:40.857 --> 00:31:43.314
It's like I can feel you
through this door.

474
00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:55.114
Hey...

475
00:31:59.626 --> 00:32:01.617
Do you remember
when we first met.

476
00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.415
and you were yelling at me
in Spanish?

477
00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:08.456
I have no recollection of that.

478
00:32:09.386 --> 00:32:11.297
I blame Lester's handwriting.

479
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:15.969
It said 31. but I read it as 37.

480
00:32:16.518 --> 00:32:19.260
and I came pounding on
your door like a jackass.

481
00:32:23.316 --> 00:32:24.916
Do you ever wonder
what would've happened

482
00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:27.229
if you knocked
on some other girl's door?

483
00:32:29.156 --> 00:32:31.363
Well. I knock
on a hundred doors a day.

484
00:32:38.874 --> 00:32:41.035
But I've never met
anyone like you.

485
00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:44.834
I'm really glad Lester
messed up that address.

486
00:32:48.341 --> 00:32:49.751
Yeah. me too.

487
00:32:58.185 --> 00:32:59.391
Oh. hey. mom.

488
00:32:59.561 --> 00:33:01.142
What are you still doing awake?

489
00:33:01.313 --> 00:33:04.726
I heard voices. Did dad leave?

490
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.937
Yeah. he had to go out.
but he'll be back.

491
00:33:08.904 --> 00:33:11.691
He shouldn't do that.
It's not safe.

492
00:33:12.866 --> 00:33:14.606
I know.

493
00:33:14.784 --> 00:33:19.073
But sometimes we have to do
things we don't want to survive.

494
00:33:24.794 --> 00:33:25.909
Mom.

495
00:33:28.215 --> 00:33:30.251
do you ever wish
I was different?

496
00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:33.883
What? No. sweetie.

497
00:33:34.054 --> 00:33:35.965
Wha... what do you mean?

498
00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:40.135
Ellie said
with you being immune.

499
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.801
there's a 50% chance I would be.

500
00:33:42.979 --> 00:33:45.015
Oh. honey. And I'm not.

501
00:33:46.608 --> 00:33:48.769
Instead. I'm even weaker
than a normal person.

502
00:33:48.944 --> 00:33:51.435
You are not weak.

503
00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:55.780
But if I wasn't like this.
you could go places.

504
00:33:55.951 --> 00:33:57.907
You wouldn't have to
worry about me.

505
00:33:58.078 --> 00:34:00.444
And why would
I wanna go anywhere

506
00:34:00.539 --> 00:34:02.075
if you couldn't be with me?

507
00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:05.202
Listen to me.

508
00:34:06.628 --> 00:34:08.289
You are perfect.

509
00:34:08.964 --> 00:34:11.080
Absolutely perfect.

510
00:34:11.258 --> 00:34:15.843
And I wouldn't change
one thing about you.

511
00:34:17.973 --> 00:34:19.929
And neither would your father.

512
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:29.973
Do you think she knows
she's a killer?

513
00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:36.529
She's right next to him
and I'm sittin' by myself

514
00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.237
she's halfway in I think
she loves somebody else

515
00:34:40.036 --> 00:34:41.242
shit

516
00:34:43.123 --> 00:34:44.738
but I love her

517
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:51.457

if you love somebody else?

520
00:34:59.055 --> 00:35:01.467
I need some help

Do you like what you see?

525
00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:17.441
Come here.

526
00:35:17.616 --> 00:35:20.278
Is it worth the risk
coming to see me?

527
00:35:20.452 --> 00:35:22.192
I guess we'll find out.

528
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:29.248
May: What do you want?

529
00:35:29.419 --> 00:35:31.159
Griffin: You know
what I really want?

530
00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:37.461
I don't want this.

531
00:35:40.889 --> 00:35:42.754
And I don't want this.

532
00:35:44.934 --> 00:35:46.720
Get this out of the way.

533
00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:53.856
I want you. Mmm-hmm.

534
00:36:55.171 --> 00:36:57.253

home or you will be apprehended.

546

Do not attempt to engage
with armed guards.

547
00:37:43.178 --> 00:37:45.419
Bribes will not be accepted.

548
00:37:45.597 --> 00:37:46.866

552
00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:56.471
They're coming.

553

No. no. they can't.
You're not sick.

554
00:37:58.818 --> 00:38:02.777
You know how this works. Nico.
If she's sick. I'm sick.

555
00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:05.438
To hell with the rules. Sara.

It's gonna be okay.

558
00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:18.576
You're going to be okay.

559
00:38:19.798 --> 00:38:21.254
Sara. I'm not letting
you give up.

560
00:38:21.925 --> 00:38:24.007
We were never
gonna get out of here.

561
00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:29.341
I have to let you go. Nico.

562
00:38:33.603 --> 00:38:35.059
Please say goodbye to me.

563
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:37.070
I'm not saying that. Sara.
I'm not saying that!

Ringtone in Lester's voice: Answer

571
00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:10.924
Answer the phone.

572
00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:13.886
Lester. I need
two immunity passes. Now.

573
00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.766
What?

574
00:39:15.937 --> 00:39:19.020
You think if I had a stash of
immunity cuffs hanging around.

575
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.771
I'd still be living
in this shithole?

576
00:39:20.942 --> 00:39:23.058
Lester. please.
They're coming for Sara.

577
00:39:23.236 --> 00:39:25.318
I have to get her out.

578
00:39:25.488 --> 00:39:27.132
This is what happens when you
fall in love with a have-not.

579
00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:28.191
I can't help you.

580

Automated female voice: This
building is under full quarantine.

581

Look. all I need is a lead.
Just give me something.

582
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.643
You know them packages

583
00:39:37.667 --> 00:39:38.907
on the side for the griffins...

584
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.621
Are you shitting me?

585
00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:41.939
I've been running
black-market cuffs

586
00:39:41.963 --> 00:39:43.123
and you didn't tell me?

587
00:39:43.298 --> 00:39:45.835
Lester: Nico. listen. you
didn't hear this shit from me.

588
00:39:46.009 --> 00:39:48.216
That asshole
is my biggest client.

589
00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:49.876
but he's also a man... get lost.

590

You do not want to mess with.

591
00:39:51.347 --> 00:39:52.883
Bracelets are 150 g's apiece.

592
00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:54.968
You better have
the money to back it up.

593
00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:56.059
I'll figure it out.

Damn. kid.

597
00:40:39.771 --> 00:40:40.931
Senor Nico.

598
00:40:49.364 --> 00:40:50.729
How was harland?

599
00:40:50.907 --> 00:40:52.272
Nuts.

600
00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:56.034
Hmm. Uh. passes for Steve
and Gwen are ready.

601
00:40:56.204 --> 00:40:58.911
Are you sure we can trust them?

602
00:41:00.208 --> 00:41:02.449
Everyone in my network
is reliable.

603
00:41:02.627 --> 00:41:04.367
That's not who
I'm worried about.

604
00:41:04.754 --> 00:41:06.540
What's... what's that
supposed to mean?

605
00:41:06.839 --> 00:41:08.500
A courier is here.

606
00:41:08.675 --> 00:41:10.882
Says he needs to speak
with you. Mr. Griffin.

607
00:41:11.052 --> 00:41:12.258
Courier?

608
00:41:12.887 --> 00:41:14.468
Thank you. Marie.

609
00:41:17.183 --> 00:41:18.468
Yeah. Nico.

610
00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:19.849
Mr. Griffin?

611
00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:21.600
Yeah. what do you want?

612
00:41:22.105 --> 00:41:24.812
I would never normally do
this. but it's an emergency.

613
00:41:26.401 --> 00:41:29.484
I need two of these.
I heard maybe you can help me.

614
00:41:32.115 --> 00:41:33.230
Mr. Griffin?

615
00:41:33.408 --> 00:41:35.524
I... I don't know
what to tell you. kid.

616
00:41:35.702 --> 00:41:40.036
I... I can't get those any
more than anybody else can.

617
00:41:40.206 --> 00:41:41.912
Look. Mr. Griffin.
I have 13 grand.

618
00:41:42.083 --> 00:41:44.123
I know that's nowhere
near enough. but it's all I...

619
00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:52.044
How does he know about us?

620
00:41:52.218 --> 00:41:53.628
I don't know.

621
00:41:53.803 --> 00:41:55.509
Who've you been
shooting your mouth off to?

622
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.449
I haven't been shooting
my mouth off to anyone.

623
00:41:57.473 --> 00:42:02.183
Why don't you ask your... your
network. 'cause it's so "reliable"?

624
00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:05.311
Do I need I remind you
what happens to us...

625
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.476
No... if people find
out what we're doing?

626
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.857
We go to jail. or even worse...
You do not. I know.

627
00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:11.893
We get thrown into the q-zone.
Really?

628
00:42:12.071 --> 00:42:13.732
And then what happens to Emma?

629
00:42:14.949 --> 00:42:18.157
Piper. I told the kid
to go away.

630
00:42:18.327 --> 00:42:20.067
What else do you want me to do?

631
00:42:20.246 --> 00:42:21.952
I'd like to know
how he knows about us.

632
00:42:22.123 --> 00:42:24.083
Well. why don't you do it?
Why don't you find out?

633
00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:27.541
I'm so sick of
cleaning up your shit.

634
00:42:27.712 --> 00:42:29.794
Uh. Nico? Mrs. Griffin?

635
00:42:29.964 --> 00:42:32.330
I think my husband
is just being extra cautious.

636
00:42:32.508 --> 00:42:34.044
but I think I can help you.

637
00:42:35.094 --> 00:42:36.209
Thank you. Mrs. Griffin.

638
00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:40.926
Hey. listen. um. who...
Who told you about us?

639
00:42:41.851 --> 00:42:43.762
Nobody. Nobody told me.

640
00:42:43.936 --> 00:42:45.372
I just... I had nowhere to go.
so I came here.

641
00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:46.852
I figured you guys
had connections.

642
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.187
Um. listen. we don't have
what you're looking for.

643
00:42:52.361 --> 00:42:55.444
but. um. I know
someone who does.

644
00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:57.530
Marie.

645
00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.660
Can I give you what I have?
It's... it's not much.

646
00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:05.533
I don't need your money.

651
00:43:26.521 --> 00:43:28.332
Nico: I have a lead. I'm on
my way there now. How's lita?

652
00:43:28.356 --> 00:43:31.393
She's not good. There's armed
guards outside my door.

653

Automated female voice: Do not
attempt to leave your home.

654

Just be ready. okay?

655
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:36.686
Okay.

657
00:45:29.352 --> 00:45:30.467
Hello?

658
00:45:36.234 --> 00:45:37.234
Hello?

660
00:45:39.654 --> 00:45:45.274
Maria

661
00:46:00.716 --> 00:46:03.002
It's like la scala in Milan.

662
00:46:04.303 --> 00:46:05.588
You see. in this country.

663
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:08.880
most people think
that puccini is a mushroom.

664
00:46:09.392 --> 00:46:10.882
You want a smoke?

665
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.925
No. I don't smoke.

666
00:46:13.104 --> 00:46:15.311
Do you know what
I love about smoking?

667
00:46:15.898 --> 00:46:20.232
It's nice to know there's something
out there that still can kill you.

668
00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:28.149
Now. a little bird came flying.
landed on my shoulder.

669
00:46:28.327 --> 00:46:32.787
whispered in my ear
that you need two passes.

670
00:46:33.416 --> 00:46:34.826
Yeah.

671
00:46:35.835 --> 00:46:36.995
Follow me.

672
00:46:43.426 --> 00:46:49.217
Don't worry. I'm a regular guy like
you. just trying to make a living.

673
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:51.176
You're a munie. right?

674
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:54.842
So I assume these passes.
they're not for you?

675
00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:58.095
No. my girl's grandma got sick.

676
00:46:58.274 --> 00:47:00.560
Let's start with the girl. Age?

677
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:02.270
Twenty-six.

678
00:47:02.445 --> 00:47:04.902
Her full name
and social. please?

679
00:47:09.368 --> 00:47:10.608
I need a name.

680
00:47:11.787 --> 00:47:13.698
because I have to
program these passes.

681
00:47:13.873 --> 00:47:14.953
You... you with me?

682
00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:17.952
Sara.

683
00:47:18.753 --> 00:47:20.869
I need her full name.

684
00:47:22.131 --> 00:47:25.339
I get it. You gotta be cautious
and you gotta be smart.

685
00:47:25.426 --> 00:47:27.087
especially these days. you know.

686
00:47:27.261 --> 00:47:30.048
I didn't set up this meeting.
You did.

687
00:47:31.223 --> 00:47:33.714
And I'm here wasting
my goddamn time.

688
00:47:33.893 --> 00:47:35.383
If you don't trust me. leave.

689
00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:37.469
No.

690
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:39.230

You good?

692
00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:47.984
You know. we're kinda lucky
because we're two munies.

693
00:47:48.574 --> 00:47:49.984
I gave you my word.

694
00:47:50.659 --> 00:47:53.275
And I would like to back it up

695
00:47:53.454 --> 00:47:54.569
the old-fashioned way.

696
00:47:58.459 --> 00:47:59.949
What do you say?

697
00:48:04.757 --> 00:48:05.792
Good.

698
00:48:05.966 --> 00:48:07.376
Feels good. doesn't it?

699
00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:09.507
It's like a childhood memory.

700
00:48:10.388 --> 00:48:13.050
A bite out of grandma's cookies.

701
00:48:14.016 --> 00:48:15.802
So I need the name of the girl.

702
00:48:15.976 --> 00:48:19.719
and I need the name of whoever
knows about this meeting.

703
00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:21.262
Do you understand?

704
00:48:22.858 --> 00:48:26.521
And I can stick as many
holes in you as I like.

705
00:48:32.243 --> 00:48:35.235
Guards! Just go in!

706
00:49:27.423 --> 00:49:29.129
Sanitation man:
Get on the ground!

707
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.090
Come on!

708
00:49:43.355 --> 00:49:44.811
What's your name. soldier? Nico.

709
00:49:44.982 --> 00:49:47.268
Nico. boomer. Why are
you even helping me?

710
00:49:47.443 --> 00:49:49.883
They drag and pull schmucks like
you down here to their death.

711
00:49:50.029 --> 00:49:51.894
Today. I'm drawing
a line in the sand.

712
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:54.446
I like you. bro.

713
00:49:55.117 --> 00:49:57.483
One dead body down here
stinks up the whole building.

714
00:49:57.661 --> 00:50:00.073
Once you get that smell
in your nostrils. it lingers.

715
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:01.407
You can't blow it out.

716
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:03.621
Tired of it. man. No more.

717
00:50:03.792 --> 00:50:05.453
Sanitation man: Over here! Shit!

718
00:50:44.416 --> 00:50:45.416
What are you doing?

719
00:50:45.584 --> 00:50:47.324
I'm staying.

720
00:50:47.503 --> 00:50:50.119
Head downstairs. That'll get
you back to the elevators.

721
00:50:52.967 --> 00:50:55.208
Stay safe. pilgrim.
I'm rooting for ya.

722
00:50:55.803 --> 00:50:57.668
Come on!

723
00:51:04.603 --> 00:51:06.264
Oh. jeez.

724
00:51:06.981 --> 00:51:08.721
How hard can it be. guys?

725
00:51:12.236 --> 00:51:13.396
Hey!

726
00:51:16.657 --> 00:51:18.802
Ringtone in Lester's voice: Answer
the phone. Answer the phone.

727
00:51:18.826 --> 00:51:20.362
Answer the phone. Answer the...

728
00:51:20.619 --> 00:51:21.825
Lester's gets.

729
00:51:21.996 --> 00:51:24.908
Distribution...
Cut the crap. Where is he?

730
00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:26.447
Who are we talking about now?

731
00:51:26.625 --> 00:51:28.456
Your courier. Nico.

732
00:51:28.627 --> 00:51:30.458
He showed up here at my house

733
00:51:30.629 --> 00:51:33.211
and he accused me of
selling black-market passes.

734
00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:36.332
Well. he's not working today.

735
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:38.876
Don't bullshit me. Lester.
I... I know you sit there

736
00:51:39.054 --> 00:51:41.636
and watch your guys drive around
all day like rats in a maze.

737
00:51:41.807 --> 00:51:45.299
Just give me his GPS or I'm gonna
take my business elsewhere.

738
00:51:48.689 --> 00:51:52.022
He. uh... looks like
he disabled his GPS.

739
00:51:52.192 --> 00:51:54.228
I'll let you know
if he comes back online.

740
00:51:54.862 --> 00:51:56.193
Yeah. you do that.

741
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:59.025
So?

742
00:51:59.575 --> 00:52:01.236
He slipped the leash.

743
00:52:01.702 --> 00:52:03.909
What do we pay harland for?

744
00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:05.785
He better get this contained.

745
00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:06.991
Yeah.

746
00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:11.579
May: So. it was pre-pandemic. and
I met this record exec online.

747
00:52:11.754 --> 00:52:13.665
and he saw one of my
YouTube videos.

748
00:52:13.756 --> 00:52:14.836
and he invited me out here.

749
00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:16.921
and he told me that
I was gonna be a big star.

750
00:52:17.343 --> 00:52:21.632
and then all the shit hit.
and I got trapped here.

751
00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:25.385
And the record deal that
never existed now was gone.

752
00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:26.765
It was never gonna happen.

753
00:52:26.935 --> 00:52:29.392
He keeps doing
this weird dance with me

754
00:52:29.563 --> 00:52:31.519
like somehow things
are gonna be different.

755
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:35.103
or somehow things are gonna be the
way that they were. but the...

756
00:52:35.277 --> 00:52:38.144
You know that nothing... nothing
is ever gonna be the same.

757
00:52:39.615 --> 00:52:41.230
And I'm lonely. you know?

758
00:52:44.703 --> 00:52:47.035
Well. this is nice
and light conversation.

759
00:52:47.206 --> 00:52:49.413
You know what I mean?

760
00:52:49.583 --> 00:52:51.949
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

761
00:52:56.382 --> 00:52:57.918
What's the matter?

762
00:52:58.092 --> 00:53:00.128
Are you okay? What's going on?
Nothing.

763
00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:08.636
Dozer: Is it that guy?

764
00:53:08.811 --> 00:53:10.597
The suit you were
telling me about?

765
00:53:11.271 --> 00:53:13.011
You gonna save me. dozer?

766
00:53:13.816 --> 00:53:16.979
I... I don't know if you're kidding or not.
Do you need saving? Do you...

767
00:53:17.319 --> 00:53:19.981
'Cause I'll come over there.
No. it's okay.

768
00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.729
If you got it. you got it.

769
00:53:23.492 --> 00:53:26.234
No. um. I'm gonna handle it.

770
00:53:27.746 --> 00:53:30.158
Are you sure?
I'm gonna handle it.

771
00:53:39.925 --> 00:53:41.085
Hey.

772
00:53:42.344 --> 00:53:43.550
Hi.

773
00:53:46.098 --> 00:53:47.429
What is it?

774
00:53:49.935 --> 00:53:51.175
She's gone.

775
00:53:57.943 --> 00:54:00.059
Please tell me
you have the passes.

776
00:54:06.034 --> 00:54:07.274
I don't.

777
00:54:08.996 --> 00:54:10.452
I don't have the passes.

778
00:54:20.674 --> 00:54:21.834
It's okay.

779
00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:24.416
Now I know where I can get some.

780
00:54:25.012 --> 00:54:27.594
But when they come.
you have to hide.

781
00:54:27.765 --> 00:54:29.221
Okay? You cannot
let them find you.

782
00:54:29.391 --> 00:54:31.311
You do whatever you
have to do. but just don't...

783
00:54:32.144 --> 00:54:34.260
I need you to buy me
a little time.

784
00:54:34.438 --> 00:54:36.019
Okay.

785
00:54:36.899 --> 00:54:38.184
I'm sorry.

786
00:54:41.153 --> 00:54:42.689
I love you.

787
00:54:45.616 --> 00:54:47.072
I love you too.

788
00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:06.174
Automated female voice:
Curfew is now in effect.

789
00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:15.013
Curfew is now in effect. All essential
workers must now return home.

790
00:55:37.042 --> 00:55:39.499
Hey. I need to... l need
to see you tonight.

791
00:55:40.963 --> 00:55:43.579
No. we... we're done. okay?

792
00:55:43.757 --> 00:55:46.419
What. are you playing hard to get?
You're driving me crazy.

793
00:55:46.593 --> 00:55:48.208
Just... please just
let me come over.

794
00:55:48.387 --> 00:55:51.470
We don't have to do anything.
I just. I need to talk.

795
00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.346
There's nothing to talk about.

796
00:55:54.977 --> 00:55:59.471
And whatever this. um.
arrangement is. it's over.

797
00:55:59.648 --> 00:56:01.934
May. come on. don't do this.

798
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:03.690
I have tapes.

799
00:56:03.861 --> 00:56:07.399
I have tapes of you promising
black-market immunity passes.

800
00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:10.151
You were recording me?

801
00:56:10.492 --> 00:56:13.154
It was just a little
life insurance policy.

802
00:56:14.997 --> 00:56:16.487
You're dumping me on the phone!

803
00:56:16.665 --> 00:56:18.621
William. leave me alone!

804
00:56:20.085 --> 00:56:21.541
Or it all goes viral.

805
00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.336
Okay?

806
00:56:30.846 --> 00:56:32.211
Bitch.

807
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:40.810
What the hell?

808
00:56:40.981 --> 00:56:42.642
Going out again?

809
00:56:44.818 --> 00:56:46.274
What are you doing?

810
00:56:47.487 --> 00:56:49.398
I know about your girlfriend.

811
00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:51.438
So what?

812
00:56:51.617 --> 00:56:56.031
Oh. no. you think I... l care
that you're screwing someone?

813
00:56:56.204 --> 00:57:01.119
No. no. This is. uh. about
Emma. our daughter.

814
00:57:01.293 --> 00:57:03.830
What chance does she have
if she gets this thing?

815
00:57:04.004 --> 00:57:07.542
I don't know. Piper. What... what chance
do any of us have if we get this thing?

816
00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:09.381
I want you out.

817
00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:11.382
Give me the gun.

818
00:57:11.553 --> 00:57:13.384
Piper. I don't have time for this.

819
00:57:13.555 --> 00:57:16.092
You let her tape you?
You dumb prick.

821
00:57:19.311 --> 00:57:21.848
You want me to clean it up?
Give me the gun.

822
00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:25.101

823
00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:27.607
What are you gonna do?
You... you gonna shoot me?

824

Get out!

825
00:57:32.032 --> 00:57:33.363
Get out.

826
00:58:32.467 --> 00:58:33.627
Hello.

I believe you know my husband.

829
00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:44.096
I think we might be able
to help one another.

830
00:58:47.649 --> 00:58:49.435
William's on his way
over to you.

831
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:52.851
I suggest that you not be
there when he arrives.

832
00:58:56.324 --> 00:58:57.564
Thank you.

833
00:59:16.344 --> 00:59:17.344

839
00:59:52.005 --> 00:59:54.337

00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:56.164
looking for one of my couriers.

841
00:59:56.927 --> 00:59:58.337
Yes. have you found him?

842
00:59:59.012 --> 01:00:00.798
Yeah. I think so.

843
01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:02.587
The thing is.

844
01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.848
I think he's

845
01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:06.633

Nothing.

868
01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:17.897
Oh. shi...

869
01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:21.981
Roses are red.

870
01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:26.613
violets are blue.

871
01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:30.409
you think you can hide.

872
01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:33.830
but I'll find you.

873
01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:12.118
Automated female voice:
Lockdown is still in effect.

874
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:15.747
The department of sanitation
will relocate the infected.

875
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.166
Man: Hey!

876
01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:22.537
Hey. give me a hand with this!

877
01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:23.796
Are you okay. Bobby?

878
01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:30.716
Then get her outta here.

879
01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:39.988
Sanitation man: We have
one deceased. one in the wind. Over.

880
01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.912
How dare you come into my house.

881
01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:58.744
I'm not here to hurt anyone.

882
01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:01.785
You've already put
my daughter's life at risk

883
01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:04.045
just by stepping foot in here.

884
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:08.041
I came to you for help. and
you tried to have me killed.

885
01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:10.585
Look. I just needed information

886
01:04:11.389 --> 01:04:14.722
because I can't allow anyone
to know what we're doing here.

887
01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:18.010
Nobody knows. and no one will.

888
01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.011
Mrs. Griffin. look. I understand

889
01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:21.584
you're just trying
to protect your daughter.

890
01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:23.064
I get that.

891
01:04:23.902 --> 01:04:27.520
Because I'm trying to save the one person
left in my life that matters to me.

892
01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:36.945
I can't leave here
without that pass.

893
01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:42.910
Please.

894
01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:45.336
Please help me.

895
01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:52.127
Top shelf.

896
01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:54.045
Come on. get it down.

897
01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:00.935
Open it up.

898
01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:05.436
You better not
make me regret this.

899
01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.814
Automated female voice: This
building has been condemned.

900
01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:11.149
The safest place
is your own home.

901
01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:16.527
Department of sanitation.
For containment you can trust.

902
01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:21.330
Man: Stay with the truck.

903
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:26.245
Piper: What's her name?

904
01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:27.913
I assume it's a girl.

905
01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:30.961
Sara Mia Garcia.

906
01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:35.879
Now what?

907
01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:37.388
Now we wait.

908
01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:59.945
Automated female voice: Stay in your homes.
We are here to help.

909
01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:03.832
If you believe your neighbor
is defying mandatory lockdown.

910
01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:05.033
give us a call.

911
01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.207
Do you know
where you're gonna go?

912
01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:15.335
Far away from here.

913
01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:19.510
We're all just trying to
protect the ones we love.

914
01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:33.027
Thank you.

915
01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:35.859
Take care.

916
01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:47.037
Oh. shit.

917
01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:49.624
Hey. guys! Hold off!

918
01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:51.333
Stop!

919
01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:53.874
Okay. call them to stop.
Call them to stop!

920
01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:55.792
The girl is in a Hazmat suit.

921
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.490
Sanitation man: Secure all personnel.
girl is in disguise. Over.

922
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.076
Yeah. Yeah.

923
01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:26.698
Hey. are you sure
it's okay if I come?

924
01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:30.535
No. it's... it's fine.
Of course. Of course.

925
01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:33.329
I'll see you soon.
Be safe getting over here.

926
01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:05.449
Okay.

927
01:08:10.545 --> 01:08:11.751
Oh. shit.

928
01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:16.372
Goddamn it.

929
01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:18.382
Come on. Come on.

930
01:08:21.306 --> 01:08:23.137
Get out of the car. may.

931
01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:24.388
You wanna play?

932
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:28.552
Please leave me alone! What?
You wanna play? Let's play!

933
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:31.016
Let's play! Get out!

934
01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:35.892
Get out of the car
or I'll kill you.

935
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:38.026
Did you think you were
just gonna leave me?

936
01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:41.314
I'll drag you out by your neck.
Get out! Get out!

937
01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:42.777
Get out!

938
01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:46.076
I'll pull you right through!

939
01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:49.405
Get out!

940
01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.086
Tango is down.

941
01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:56.746
We're at bingo fuel.

942
01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.665
Recalling.

943
01:09:02.722 --> 01:09:05.338
We're going. We're going home.

944
01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:33.366
Harland: Nice try.

945
01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:37.582
Take this off. Get it off.

946
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.463
Relax. breathe it in.
Breathe it in.

947
01:09:44.722 --> 01:09:46.963
You don't get it. do you?

948
01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:52.973
You're not stupid.

949
01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:57.023
No symptoms

950
01:09:57.193 --> 01:10:01.857
after being locked up
with your infectious grandma.

951
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:07.488
You'd be coughing up
your lungs right now.

952
01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:10.495
and that makes you immune.

953
01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:15.207
If that's true. then let me go.

954
01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:18.627
I'm so sorry.

955
01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:21.126
That's not how it works.

956
01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:22.836
Take her.

957
01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:35.724
Saral

958
01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:43.857
Oh. no. no. no. no!

959
01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:45.146
Saral

960
01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:04.298
Well. she really
captured your likeness.

961
01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:05.925
Talented girl.

962
01:11:07.972 --> 01:11:09.132
Who are you?

963
01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:13.679
Before this shit
started to hit the fan.

964
01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:16.640
I used to drive garbage trucks

965
01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:18.770
for the department
of sanitation.

966
01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:23.525
Then all of a sudden
my superiors.

967
01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:25.607
they started to die off.

968
01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:29.319
And then one day.

969
01:11:29.744 --> 01:11:34.113
I was running
the whole damn department.

970
01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:36.868
I did it. Four aces.

971
01:11:37.043 --> 01:11:39.329
It's called the "idiot." Look.

972
01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.704
Happens once in a lifetime.

973
01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:47.342
Emmett d. Harland.
once a lowly refuse collector.

974
01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:51.763
is now the thin blue line
between death...

975
01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:55.767
And a miserable existence.

976
01:11:56.103 --> 01:11:58.389
Hey. uh. what about yourself?

977
01:11:59.106 --> 01:12:00.971
What did you do before the fall?

978
01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:04.021
I was a paralegal.

979
01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:07.277
I was putting myself
through law school.

980
01:12:08.115 --> 01:12:09.525
On.

981
01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.032
Well. I guess it didn't
work out for everybody.

982
01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.198
That's your problem. Nico.

983
01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:20.162
You don't seem
to understand how good

984
01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:23.499
us munies have it. huh?

985
01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:26.588
Only a handful of us.
like you and me.

986
01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:29.383
we're allowed to roam
around as we like.

987
01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:33.713
You want a new car? Just go to
the dealership and drive it off.

988
01:12:34.392 --> 01:12:38.135
Go into a house up in the
hills and just take over.

989
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:40.436
We're untouchable.

990
01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:43.397
You see. munies.

991
01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.900
we're not human anymore.

992
01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.897
We're gods.

993
01:12:51.576 --> 01:12:54.409
And how do you use
your godly power. huh?

994
01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:57.153
You run around

995
01:12:57.331 --> 01:13:02.667
and you try to save some
specimen that is bound to die.

996
01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:04.914
I mean. what's wrong with you?

997
01:13:05.089 --> 01:13:08.252
You could have
the whole fucking world.

998
01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:10.594
Where's Sara?

999
01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:13.378
Oh. Sara? I don't know.

1000
01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:17.174
She's halfway to the
q-zone by now. I guess.

1001
01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:19.050
I'm sorry.

1002
01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:20.972
You won't be joining her.

1003
01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:32.583
It's nice to know there's something
still out there that can kill you.

1004
01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:00.787
Ringtone in Lester's voice: Answer
the phone. Answer the phone.

1005
01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:02.142
Answer the... Nico?

1006
01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:03.678
I got something
I gotta tell you.

1007
01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:05.500
Yeah. you told the griffins
I was at their house.

1008
01:14:05.524 --> 01:14:08.186
Fair to say you owe me one?
I'm sorry. man.

1009
01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:11.444
There's a sanitation transport headed
for the q-zone. I need to find it.

1010
01:14:11.739 --> 01:14:13.149
That ain't gonna be easy.

1011
01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:15.815
I have an ID. 0715-gls.

1012
01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.697
Lester: / think I might know
someone who can help.

1013
01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.801
I've already mapped out
every route

1014
01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:41.348
from Sara's place to the zone.

1015
01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:43.718
We gotta search grid by grid.

1016
01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:44.976
Copy that.

1017
01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:01.528
Keep heading southeast. We're
not seeing anything behind you.

1018
01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:17.418
Ho... hold up! Hold up!

1019
01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:22.632
Yup. 0715-gls.

1020
01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:26.473
The truck is headed south on western.
I repeat. south on western.

1021
01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:33.233
Dozer: We have visual confirmation.
Target is heading...

1022
01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:35.895
Heading east on 8th. We got 'em.

1023
01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:37.404
Nico! We found her.

1024
01:15:37.575 --> 01:15:40.032
She's headed east on 8th.
just past western.

1025
01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:42.042
They're almost at the zone.
so you better book.

1026
01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:44.195
Nico: I copy that.

1027
01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.534
Lester: You're not gonna
make it. man. Hurry up!

1028
01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:53.469
Woman: You have
arrived at q-zone Alpha.

1029
01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:55.047
Welcome to q-zone Alpha.

1030
01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:56.832
You must follow all directions.

1031
01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:58.922
All instructions are mandatory.

1032
01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:01.052
Prepare for immediate
processing.

1033
01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:04.340
Proceed fo holding area
for decontamination.

1034
01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:08.886
Man: Let's go.

1035
01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:15.104
Help me!

1036
01:16:33.964 --> 01:16:35.670
Just trust me. okay?
I trust you.

1037
01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:38.708
On your knees!
Get on your knees now!

1038
01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:40.342
Get on your knees!

1039
01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:42.753
Nico: Don't hurt her.

1040
01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:46.761
She's immune!

1041
01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:48.216
She's immune! Scan the bracelet!

1042
01:16:48.312 --> 01:16:49.427
Scan it.

1043
01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:53.518
Man: She's got a bracelet!

1044
01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:04.737
Run the ID.

1045
01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:25.765
She's good.

1046
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.466
Policeman: ID checks out.
She's good.

1047
01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:20.689
I... it's okay.

1048
01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:23.774
I'm like you.

1049
01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:56.303
Lester. it's Nico.

1050
01:18:56.607 --> 01:18:57.642
We got her.

1051
01:18:57.983 --> 01:18:59.564
We're getting out of here.

1052
01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:11.944
We're going home.

1053
01:19:23.384 --> 01:19:27.127
She's addicted to the ig

1054
01:19:27.304 --> 01:19:30.011
like it was an lv

1055
01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:34.391
it's all about the money

1056
01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:37.223
you'd think she wasn't ugly

1057
01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.765
she can barely...

1058
01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:43.559
Nico: Lester. I hope
this finds you well. man.

1059
01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:45.944
Sara says hi.

1060
01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:50.608
It's been three months.
Feels like three years.

1061
01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:56.156
And the air out here.
you wouldn't believe it.

1062
01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:57.539
I can breathe again.

1063
01:19:59.545 --> 01:20:02.912
I wanted to thank you
for helping us get out.

1064
01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:06.173
And for helping a kid who lost
everything find a purpose.

1065
01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:10.586
You know. I realize now we weren't
just delivering packages.

1066
01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:12.254
We were delivering hope.

1067
01:20:14.393 --> 01:20:17.885
Harland and Griffin were reportedly
selling illegal immunity bracelets

1068
01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:20.099
to wealthy buyers
on the westside.

1069
01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:22.105
And in a stunning revelation.

1070
01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:24.646
Griffin's own wife.
and a popular online streamer

1071
01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:25.977
who had evidence of the crimes.

1072
01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:29.022
worked together
to expose the conspiracy.

1073
01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:32.824
Always hiding all your problems

1074
01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:34.656
you never try to solve them

1075
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.036
Emma: Mom?

1076
01:20:36.206 --> 01:20:37.321
Yeah?

1077
01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:38.826
Where's Marie?

1078
01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:41.075
She went home to her family.

1079
01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.709
She can barely

1080
01:20:48.635 --> 01:20:49.875
give it to me

1081
01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:51.419
it's a good thing.

1082
01:20:52.806 --> 01:20:54.091
It's only ready

1083
01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.470
that I'm the only

1084
01:20:57.644 --> 01:21:00.010
these eyes I see you

1085
01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:03.973
Nico: I hope that one day
we can open our doors.

1086
01:21:04.151 --> 01:21:05.357
walk outside

1087
01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:07.939
and get back
to the things we love.

1088
01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:12.277
And you're leaving
me with the weight of the world

1089
01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:14.612
these eyes I see you

1090
01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:19.747
and you're leaving me
with the weight of the world

1091
01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:23.867
may: Whoo!

1092
01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:26.628
Man. I have missed the ocean.
This is incredible!

1093
01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:31.633
Whoo-hoo!

1094
01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:41.726
Nico: / don't know how many
packages we delivered together.

1095
01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:44.058
but now I'm sending you one.

1096
01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:47.853
But whatever you decide to do
with what's inside...

1097
01:21:49.196 --> 01:21:50.811
Promise me one thing.

1098
01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:53.481
Don't ever give up.

1099
01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:17.338
These eyes I see you

1100
01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:20.383
and you're leaving me

1101
01:22:27.526 --> 01:22:31.314
The weight of the world

1102
01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:55.213
Getting used to the dark

1103
01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:58.720
but losing track of who we are

1104
01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:01.257
you say I don't have to worry

1105
01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:04.552
oh. even though
we're miles apart

1106
01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:08.681
look at what we've become

1107
01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:12.147
we're breathing hate
through our lungs

1108
01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:14.733
I hope that it's not contagious

1109
01:23:14.907 --> 01:23:17.944
'cause I can taste it
on my tongue

1110
01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:26.115
I can feel the tension

1111
01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:32.913
building like a question

1112
01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:41.551
Chasin' a fire

1113
01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:45.513
oh. nobody can put it out

1114
01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:50.272
we're put into cages
no one fo save us how

1115
01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:55.019
yeah. I know you're tired

1116
01:23:58.940 --> 01:23:59.117
oh. but I know
you'll never break

1117
01:23:59.118 --> 01:24:04.077
we turned our whole kingdom
into a prison now

1118
01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:06.489
and now we're breaking out

1119
01:24:06.667 --> 01:24:09.033
is it safe? Are we free?

1120
01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:12.624
Can't get rid of the memories

1121
01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:15.130
making me feel like I'm drowning

1122
01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:18.337
'cause it keeps playing
on repeat

1123
01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:22.425
I don't know how it ends

1124
01:24:22.599 --> 01:24:25.807
our hearts are craving
for revenge

1125
01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:28.515
imagine that it's not forever

1126
01:24:28.689 --> 01:24:31.726
oh. and we get to start again

1127
01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:41.987
Chasin' a fire

1128
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:45.903
oh. nobody can put it out

1129
01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:51.041
we turned all our kingdom
into a prison now

1130
01:24:51.211 --> 01:24:54.248
but now we're breaking out
