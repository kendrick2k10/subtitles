3
00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:29.788
- I've never been the
smoothest with the ladies.

4
00:00:29.822 --> 00:00:31.065
I think we all know that.

5
00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:34.241
I did get it right once though.

6
00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:38.555
Or rather I didn't screw it up.

7
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.769
We met at a bar. it was her
local bar. Rocky's Tavern.

8
00:00:45.804 --> 00:00:49.049
I'd never been there before.
I just stopped by for a drink.

9
00:00:50.774 --> 00:00:52.121
And that's when I saw Cindy.

10
00:00:56.504 --> 00:00:59.162
Everyone. I mean
everyone knew Cindy.

11
00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:04.340
She was laughing. dancing.
calling the employees by name.

12
00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:07.722
She must've known I was
thinking about her too

13
00:01:07.757 --> 00:01:09.310
because she sat
down at my table.

14
00:01:11.278 --> 00:01:12.589
I nearly spilled my drink.

15
00:01:14.143 --> 00:01:17.801
Like. damn.

16
00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:18.664
Me?

17
00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:23.255
She sat down and she smiled.

18
00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:26.431
She was lonely.

19
00:01:28.778 --> 00:01:31.815
I mean she was kind. engaged.

20
00:01:34.887 --> 00:01:39.892
Happy even. I don't
know how else to say it.

21
00:01:40.617 --> 00:01:41.584
She was just lonely.

22
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.382
Of course. I was lonely too.

23
00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:49.212
So Pete. do
you wanna hear about me?

24
00:01:50.627 --> 00:01:51.904
- That night she told me

25
00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.390
all sorts of personal
things about her life.

26
00:01:54.424 --> 00:01:56.978
About her best friends
in high school.

27
00:01:57.013 --> 00:01:59.809
How she could have been in
the Olympics if she wanted to.

28
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:02.984
She didn't.

29
00:02:05.194 --> 00:02:07.265
How many guys the
waitress had slept with.

30
00:02:08.438 --> 00:02:09.232
Seven.

31
00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.409
She talked me about her sister

32
00:02:13.443 --> 00:02:16.066
and the woods at night
and it was beautiful.

33
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:19.587
My God. it was so beautiful.

34
00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:23.522
I felt like I was
living it all with her.

35
00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:27.457
I had nothing to add. you know?

36
00:02:28.907 --> 00:02:31.427
I just nodded. I
stirred my drink

37
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:33.325
and I helped her finish hers.

38
00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:38.744
I started to make
up my own stories.

39
00:02:41.506 --> 00:02:42.507
Isn't that pathetic?

40
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.171
My own emotions and memories
and opinions. all fake.

41
00:02:54.622 --> 00:02:55.451
She knew it.

42
00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.352
It only made her lonelier.

43
00:03:05.702 --> 00:03:08.015
She think I resent
her. but I don't.

44
00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.155
I never no. I wanna be her.

45
00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:14.263
To have those emotions
and memories and opinions.

46
00:03:14.297 --> 00:03:15.160
To live.

47
00:03:18.508 --> 00:03:19.337
And I tried.

48
00:03:22.063 --> 00:03:24.204
I really really tried.

49
00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:29.623
'cause in my heart I believe
that I still love her.

50
00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:39.805
She was as lonely last week
as the night I met her.

51
00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:47.641
- Let there be...Hey!

52
00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:51.369
Well welcome. welcome.
welcome. welcome to my home.

53
00:03:51.403 --> 00:03:54.095
It's um. well. home.

54
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.890
I'm a book.

55
00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:57.271
Have you ever met a book?

56
00:03:57.306 --> 00:03:59.446
Like really engaged with it?

57
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.068
I mean I know we're just words.

58
00:04:01.102 --> 00:04:03.381
but I think that makes
us very interesting!

59
00:04:03.415 --> 00:04:07.074
Words. language. words!

60
00:04:07.108 --> 00:04:10.042
No guttural nonsense.
you know. no ugh.

61
00:04:10.974 --> 00:04:12.424
"How are you feeling today?"

62
00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.529
"Ugh."

63
00:04:13.563 --> 00:04:14.461
It's not a word.

64
00:04:14.495 --> 00:04:16.704
It's a sound. an emotion.

65
00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:17.705
And those are great.

66
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.673
I mean emotions.
shew. are great.

67
00:04:19.707 --> 00:04:22.572
But your emotions
they need the word!

68
00:04:22.607 --> 00:04:25.403
Just as the word
needs your emotions.

69
00:04:25.437 --> 00:04:30.442
I mean all my juicy words like
exalted and yearning. lust.

70
00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:32.962
well they're nothing
without your ugh ugh ugh.

71
00:04:39.037 --> 00:04:39.865
Exhibit A.

72
00:04:42.868 --> 00:04:45.940
So. what else about me?

73
00:04:45.975 --> 00:04:48.771
Oh. one could say I'm
about 1.500 years old.

74
00:04:48.805 --> 00:04:50.738
depending on your translation.

75
00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:51.981
But I like to think of
myself as still relevant.

76
00:04:52.015 --> 00:04:54.777
Still hot with the kids.

77
00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:59.368
I'm not one of those grumpy.
old. get off-my-shelf books.

78
00:05:00.955 --> 00:05:04.821
I mean I once knew a copy of
Moby Dick that was. a dick.

79
00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:07.824
"The new books this
and the new books that"

80
00:05:07.859 --> 00:05:08.756
Couldn't keep up.

81
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:10.102
That's what makes me special.

82
00:05:10.137 --> 00:05:11.069
I adapt.

83
00:05:11.103 --> 00:05:12.346
I am always adapting.

84
00:05:12.381 --> 00:05:15.591
Country to country.
century to century.

85
00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:19.733
I'm the one the only.
the hallowed the holy.

86
00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:21.528
Bible!

87
00:07:09.394 --> 00:07:10.326
Wanna talk?

88
00:07:11.292 --> 00:07:12.811
- No.

89
00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:14.019
- Okay.

90
00:07:14.054 --> 00:07:16.125
I'm Gid. by the way.

91
00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:17.644
Gideon. Gid.

92
00:07:17.678 --> 00:07:18.507
- Hey Gid.

93
00:07:34.626 --> 00:07:35.455
Stop!

94
00:07:36.352 --> 00:07:37.698
- Stop what?

95
00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:39.010
- Looking at me like that.

96
00:07:39.044 --> 00:07:39.942
- Like what?

97
00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:40.736
- Like you're judging me.

98
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.013
- I'm not judging you.

99
00:07:43.704 --> 00:07:44.533
- Whatever.

100
00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:45.395
- I'm not.

101
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.224
Should I be?

102
00:07:46.258 --> 00:07:47.087
- No!
- Okay.

103
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:47.915
- Okay.

104
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:48.778
- Okay.

105
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.263
- What do you want from me?

106
00:07:51.298 --> 00:07:52.506
- I just want to talk!

107
00:07:52.541 --> 00:07:53.783
- Don't most motels at
least have the courtesy

108
00:07:53.818 --> 00:07:54.646
to leave you in the drawer.

109
00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:55.613
Jesus Christ.

110
00:07:55.647 --> 00:07:56.683
- Language.

111
00:07:57.822 --> 00:07:58.995
- Really?

112
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.342
- Look. I sit here all day.

113
00:08:01.377 --> 00:08:02.758
Stuck in this motel room.

114
00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:04.276
Waiting for you.

115
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:05.485
You don't have to
be rude about it.

116
00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.831
Gosh.

117
00:08:06.865 --> 00:08:08.073
- You can't leave?

118
00:08:08.108 --> 00:08:09.005
- Not unless you
take me with you.

119
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.213
Sounds terrible.

120
00:08:10.248 --> 00:08:11.456
- It is!

121
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.595
Stuck in this hotel
room. my goodness.

122
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.665
- No. I meant
taking you with me.

123
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.666
Walking around with you.

124
00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:16.185
My god. it sounds awful.

125
00:08:16.219 --> 00:08:18.152
- Mm. resistance
to the Word of God.

126
00:08:18.187 --> 00:08:19.602
You know you got a
real Paul complex.

127
00:08:19.637 --> 00:08:21.259
- Paul. huh?
- Mm hmm.

128
00:08:22.432 --> 00:08:23.606
- You know I saw myself

129
00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:25.159
as more of George
Harrison kinda guy.

130
00:08:25.194 --> 00:08:26.540
- No. no. no you're a Paul.

131
00:08:26.575 --> 00:08:27.990
He used to be a real sourpuss.

132
00:08:28.024 --> 00:08:28.818
- Sourpuss?

133
00:08:28.853 --> 00:08:30.855
- But then one day.

134
00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:34.928
Acts 9:4. a light from
heaven flashed around him.

135
00:08:34.962 --> 00:08:37.551
He fell to the ground
and heard a voice say

136
00:08:37.586 --> 00:08:39.967
"I am Jesus. whom
you are persecuting.

137
00:08:40.002 --> 00:08:41.762
"Now get up and
go into the city.

138
00:08:41.797 --> 00:08:43.419
"and you will be told
what you must do."

139
00:08:43.453 --> 00:08:44.247
- Very dramatic.

140
00:08:44.282 --> 00:08:45.455
- Oh yes.

141
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.698
God zapped him right
then and there.

142
00:08:46.733 --> 00:08:47.561
- With lightning?

143
00:08:47.596 --> 00:08:48.424
- With love.

144
00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:51.116
And blindness.

145
00:08:51.151 --> 00:08:53.947
And he went on to spread the
Word of God all over the world.

146
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:56.501
and ultimately had a
big hand in writing me.

147
00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.296
- So. I'm the sourpuss.

148
00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.299
and you are the flash of
light that's gonna save me.

149
00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:02.127
Is that right?

150
00:09:02.162 --> 00:09:03.957
- In a word. amen.

151
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:07.754
I'd still
rather be George Harrison.

152
00:09:07.788 --> 00:09:09.238
- Don't know that I know him.

153
00:09:09.272 --> 00:09:11.033
- Oo. probably 'cause all
you got is Bible stuff

154
00:09:11.067 --> 00:09:14.139
and I'm not really
talking Bible stuff

155
00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:16.383
so back in the drawer with ya.

156
00:09:16.417 --> 00:09:17.867
- No. no. come on.

157
00:09:17.902 --> 00:09:20.145
Come on. we don't have to
talk about Bible stuff.

158
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.354
We could talk about anything.

159
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:23.770
What's going on with the world?

160
00:09:23.804 --> 00:09:24.771
Is Reagan still president?

161
00:09:24.805 --> 00:09:26.151
- What?

162
00:09:26.186 --> 00:09:27.394
No.

163
00:09:27.428 --> 00:09:31.122
Politics are just a big
Reality TV show mess.

164
00:09:31.156 --> 00:09:32.054
- TV?

165
00:09:32.088 --> 00:09:32.986
Well. Reagan was an actor.

166
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.849
- Not the same.

167
00:09:33.883 --> 00:09:34.712
- Okay!

168
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:37.197
Is Batman still a thing?

169
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:39.164
- Yes. Batman is still a thing.

170
00:09:39.199 --> 00:09:39.993
- Great!

171
00:09:40.027 --> 00:09:40.821
Batman's my favorite.

172
00:09:40.856 --> 00:09:41.753
- Mine too.

173
00:09:41.788 --> 00:09:42.616
- Are the Yankees still good?

174
00:09:42.651 --> 00:09:43.721
- Ah they're better.

175
00:09:43.755 --> 00:09:45.205
- Dang.
- Yeah.

176
00:09:45.239 --> 00:09:47.552
Oh. but the Cubs won the World
Series a couple years ago.

177
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.760
- No way?

178
00:09:48.795 --> 00:09:49.968
- Yeah. yeah. It
was pretty crazy.

179
00:09:50.003 --> 00:09:53.731
- Oh praise God from
whom all blessings flow!

180
00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:54.594
Oh he's good.

181
00:09:54.628 --> 00:09:57.251
Whoo hoo ha ha ha.

182
00:09:57.286 --> 00:09:58.563
Oh my.

183
00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.427
Oh my!

184
00:10:00.461 --> 00:10:01.324
Oh!

185
00:10:01.359 --> 00:10:02.636
Oh that's my God.

186
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:03.982
That is my God.

187
00:10:04.017 --> 00:10:06.157
That's an answer to
a lot of prayers.

188
00:10:06.191 --> 00:10:07.399
- Oh yeah. I bet.

189
00:10:07.434 --> 00:10:08.331
- You would not
believe how many.

190
00:10:08.366 --> 00:10:09.160
- In this town?

191
00:10:09.194 --> 00:10:10.092
I'm sure.

192
00:10:10.126 --> 00:10:11.749
- Can I confess something?

193
00:10:11.783 --> 00:10:13.302
- Sure.
- I love baseball.

194
00:10:13.336 --> 00:10:15.580
It's just so. everyone's there.

195
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.237
Cheering for the same team.

196
00:10:17.271 --> 00:10:18.479
And they're so happy!

197
00:10:18.514 --> 00:10:19.929
They're in unity.

198
00:10:19.964 --> 00:10:22.138
Celebrating the
same amazing thing.

199
00:10:23.553 --> 00:10:24.900
It's like heaven.

200
00:10:24.934 --> 00:10:26.315
- Uh huh.

201
00:10:26.349 --> 00:10:27.557
- A solid 30 years of prayers

202
00:10:27.592 --> 00:10:29.732
I've heard up to the
big guy about it.

203
00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:31.354
Or was it 40?

204
00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:32.770
Oh my goodness.

205
00:10:32.804 --> 00:10:34.047
What year is it?

206
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:35.600
I'm sorry I try. but
I always lose track.

207
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.775
- It's 2019.

208
00:10:37.809 --> 00:10:39.604
- 2019?

209
00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:40.432
Wow.

210
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.022
And we still have Batman!

211
00:10:44.057 --> 00:10:44.920
Mm mm mm.

212
00:10:44.954 --> 00:10:46.818
That makes me happy.

213
00:10:46.853 --> 00:10:47.647
Shoobado bop.

214
00:10:49.718 --> 00:10:51.271
- How old are you?

215
00:10:51.305 --> 00:10:53.618
- Oh. one could say
1500 years. depending...

216
00:10:54.826 --> 00:10:55.689
Me personally?

217
00:10:55.724 --> 00:10:56.517
- Yeah.

218
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.143
- Let's see. it's 2019.

219
00:11:01.177 --> 00:11:03.593
Gosh. that's a lot.

220
00:11:03.628 --> 00:11:05.009
66.

221
00:11:05.043 --> 00:11:07.356
Published Gideon's
international 1953.

222
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.184
- Wow.
- Yep.

223
00:11:09.323 --> 00:11:11.256
Been stuck in this
hotel room ever since.

224
00:11:12.602 --> 00:11:13.983
- Dang.

225
00:11:14.018 --> 00:11:14.846
- Yep.

226
00:11:16.296 --> 00:11:18.298
Used to have a working TV!

227
00:11:18.332 --> 00:11:19.368
In '84.

228
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.853
Kinda never fixed it.

229
00:11:21.888 --> 00:11:26.409
Then with laptops and
smartphones. yeah.

230
00:11:26.444 --> 00:11:29.033
Haven't really been used
much in the last few years.

231
00:11:30.931 --> 00:11:35.108
Except for. you know.

232
00:11:35.142 --> 00:11:35.971
- Hm?

233
00:11:37.386 --> 00:11:40.320
- This one guy needed some
paper to roll a joint.

234
00:11:40.354 --> 00:11:41.873
Stole a piece of Judges.

235
00:11:41.908 --> 00:11:43.185
Kind of ironic actually.

236
00:11:44.117 --> 00:11:45.256
Yeah.

237
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.327
Oh then some guy spilled
coffee on my once.

238
00:11:47.361 --> 00:11:48.604
- Bible study?

239
00:11:48.638 --> 00:11:49.778
- AA meeting.

240
00:11:49.812 --> 00:11:52.159
Lost soul. searching
for the answer.

241
00:11:52.194 --> 00:11:52.988
- Jesus Christ.

242
00:11:53.022 --> 00:11:53.851
- That's the one!

243
00:11:55.059 --> 00:11:55.956
- I bet you see a
lot of shady stuff

244
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:57.130
in this hotel room. huh.

245
00:11:57.164 --> 00:11:58.614
- Not always!

246
00:11:58.648 --> 00:12:00.720
Once a kindergartner needed
something to draw on.

247
00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:01.548
Back cover.

248
00:12:04.862 --> 00:12:05.897
Cool. eh?

249
00:12:05.932 --> 00:12:06.760
- It's cute.

250
00:12:06.795 --> 00:12:07.796
- Yeah. I think so.

251
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.383
I mean. it's not Picasso.

252
00:12:09.418 --> 00:12:11.454
- Eh. maybe it is Picasso.

253
00:12:11.489 --> 00:12:12.352
- Hey.
- Hey.

254
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:18.185
I guess. that makes you
her Bible then. huh.

255
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.117
- Uh. no. no.

256
00:12:19.152 --> 00:12:20.947
I'm not really anyone's Bible.

257
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:23.570
Or. I'm everyone's Bible.
everyone who walks in the room.

258
00:12:23.604 --> 00:12:26.366
That's kinda how I
think about it. anyways.

259
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.231
But no no. I'm no...

260
00:12:30.715 --> 00:12:32.130
I don't belong to anyone.

261
00:12:33.304 --> 00:12:35.513
No underlined passages.

262
00:12:35.547 --> 00:12:38.827
or highlighted Psalms
of encouragement.

263
00:12:39.897 --> 00:12:40.760
Yeah.

264
00:12:42.969 --> 00:12:44.004
Just a princess.

265
00:12:47.836 --> 00:12:49.251
- I never wrote in my Bible.

266
00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:51.667
- You should.

267
00:12:51.701 --> 00:12:52.806
You really should.

268
00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:53.703
- Yeah.

269
00:12:57.086 --> 00:12:58.294
- Expecting someone?

270
00:12:58.329 --> 00:12:59.157
- Huh?

271
00:13:00.849 --> 00:13:01.677
No.

272
00:13:03.334 --> 00:13:05.094
No. no. just uh...

273
00:13:07.234 --> 00:13:08.477
Waiting.

274
00:13:08.511 --> 00:13:10.030
- Well. want to hear a
story while you wait?

275
00:13:10.065 --> 00:13:11.307
No.

276
00:13:11.342 --> 00:13:12.999
- "In the beginning. God
created the heavens a-"

277
00:13:13.033 --> 00:13:15.173
Not that one.

278
00:13:15.208 --> 00:13:16.485
- "And there were shepherds

279
00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:18.521
"living out in
the fields nearby"

280
00:13:18.556 --> 00:13:19.557
No.

281
00:13:21.007 --> 00:13:22.802
- "By prayer and petition.

282
00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:24.942
"with thanksgiving.
present your requests to"

283
00:13:24.976 --> 00:13:25.977
Next.

284
00:13:27.496 --> 00:13:29.325
- "He spilled his
semen on the ground

285
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.914
"to keep from providing
offspring for his brother."

286
00:13:33.295 --> 00:13:34.641
- Oh my god!

287
00:13:34.675 --> 00:13:35.504
That's in there?

288
00:13:36.574 --> 00:13:37.609
- You'd be surprised.

289
00:13:40.095 --> 00:13:40.889
- Damn.

290
00:13:41.993 --> 00:13:42.822
- Indeed.

291
00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:50.312
So what's the gun for?

292
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.281
- Nothing.

293
00:13:54.316 --> 00:13:55.213
Nothing?

294
00:13:55.248 --> 00:13:56.042
- Nothing.

295
00:13:56.076 --> 00:13:57.319
- Is it a drug thing?

296
00:13:57.353 --> 00:13:58.216
- No!

297
00:13:58.251 --> 00:13:59.493
- Is it a stakeout?

298
00:13:59.528 --> 00:14:00.391
Wait! You're a cop?

299
00:14:00.425 --> 00:14:01.668
- Stop it!

300
00:14:01.702 --> 00:14:02.807
- Oh. you must be
really undercover.

301
00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:03.912
How long since you've shaved?

302
00:14:03.946 --> 00:14:05.120
- I'm not a cop.

303
00:14:05.154 --> 00:14:07.053
- Hmm. maybe a detective?

304
00:14:07.087 --> 00:14:08.019
You seem like a good guy.

305
00:14:08.054 --> 00:14:09.262
- I'm not a good guy.

306
00:14:09.296 --> 00:14:11.885
- So a bad guy who
talks to Bibles.

307
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.542
- Bad guys don't use the Bible?

308
00:14:13.576 --> 00:14:14.474
- Not like this.

309
00:14:14.508 --> 00:14:16.269
- This isn't special man.

310
00:14:17.718 --> 00:14:18.996
I've read you before.

311
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.170
- Oh right. your unmarked Bible.

312
00:14:21.205 --> 00:14:22.585
No wonder you're confused.

313
00:14:25.209 --> 00:14:26.417
- I got stuff to focus on.

314
00:14:26.451 --> 00:14:27.625
- Mm. Gun stuff?

315
00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:28.591
- You're not talking
me out of this!

316
00:14:28.626 --> 00:14:29.558
- Talking you out of what?

317
00:14:29.592 --> 00:14:30.662
- This!
- This what?

318
00:14:32.009 --> 00:14:33.251
- Use your words. Pete!

319
00:14:33.286 --> 00:14:35.564
Ugh is not a word.
it's a sound an em-

320
00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:38.981
Yeah. that's not
really how this works.

321
00:14:39.016 --> 00:14:40.672
- I'm not talking to you.

322
00:14:41.604 --> 00:14:42.951
- If you insist.

323
00:14:45.988 --> 00:14:47.645
What's this?
- Don't.

324
00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:48.611
- Is this what you
wanted to talk about?

325
00:14:48.646 --> 00:14:50.096
- Touch that.
- A letter.

326
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.925
"Dear Candy"?
- Cindy!

327
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.133
- Cindy! Sorry.

328
00:14:53.168 --> 00:14:55.032
You need to work on
your handwriting. sir.

329
00:14:56.033 --> 00:14:57.620
Is she who the gun's for?

330
00:15:01.452 --> 00:15:02.280
- No.

331
00:15:09.253 --> 00:15:12.221
- "Dear Cindy. I miss you.

332
00:15:14.396 --> 00:15:15.500
"Isn't that crazy?

333
00:15:16.674 --> 00:15:19.125
"Even when I think
about you with Leo.

334
00:15:20.195 --> 00:15:21.023
"I miss you.

335
00:15:23.439 --> 00:15:24.854
"But I can't forgive you.

336
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.996
"And I certainly
won't forgive Leo.

337
00:15:29.618 --> 00:15:33.484
"If you are reading this.
then Leo's not around anymore.

338
00:15:33.518 --> 00:15:34.347
"Good.

339
00:15:35.762 --> 00:15:39.076
"I'm sure that hurts. but that's
a price I'm willing to pay.

340
00:15:41.561 --> 00:15:44.495
"If you're reading this now.
then you've already paid it.

341
00:15:47.774 --> 00:15:48.602
"I love you.

342
00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:55.713
"I'm sorry you were lonely and
I'm sorry I could never help.

343
00:15:58.819 --> 00:15:59.993
"Peter Jameson"

344
00:16:06.448 --> 00:16:07.345
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:09.106 --> 00:16:10.624
- For what?

346
00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:11.798
You didn't do anything.

347
00:16:13.075 --> 00:16:15.457
Then again action really
isn't your thing. huh?

348
00:16:16.837 --> 00:16:19.771
You're all about talking.
judging. predicting.

349
00:16:21.842 --> 00:16:24.052
You haven't done shit
for thousands of years.

350
00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:39.308
What the hell is this?

351
00:16:39.343 --> 00:16:40.137
- What?
- This!

352
00:16:40.171 --> 00:16:42.242
What the hell is this?

353
00:16:42.277 --> 00:16:43.416
- Sorry.

354
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:44.589
Lots of people
find me comforting.

355
00:16:44.624 --> 00:16:45.590
- Comforting?

356
00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:46.971
- Um. yes.
- I don't.

357
00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:49.629
- Okay. maybe I rushed the hug.

358
00:16:49.663 --> 00:16:51.562
Look. it's been a
while for me. okay?

359
00:16:51.596 --> 00:16:54.116
And I'm just meeting you.
you're just meeting me.

360
00:16:54.151 --> 00:16:55.186
It's our first time!

361
00:16:55.221 --> 00:16:56.049
We'll get it.

362
00:16:57.361 --> 00:16:58.741
- Now I'm really uncomfortable.

363
00:16:58.776 --> 00:16:59.604
- Fine.

364
00:17:00.605 --> 00:17:02.435
But I'm trying over here.

365
00:17:02.469 --> 00:17:04.609
and you have been
nothing but rude to me.

366
00:17:04.644 --> 00:17:05.852
Rude to you?

367
00:17:05.886 --> 00:17:08.510
Look princess. I'm
not gonna get tricked

368
00:17:08.544 --> 00:17:10.408
into feeling sorry
for you. okay?

369
00:17:10.443 --> 00:17:11.651
You are not a perfect book.

370
00:17:11.685 --> 00:17:12.617
You're not worth defending.

371
00:17:12.652 --> 00:17:14.964
You're not an underdog.

372
00:17:14.999 --> 00:17:16.138
You're kind of a monster.

373
00:17:16.173 --> 00:17:17.346
And sure. my parents
got off on you.

374
00:17:17.381 --> 00:17:18.899
but I sure as hell
don't have to.

375
00:17:18.934 --> 00:17:21.730
Frankly. if I never saw you
again. I'd be a happier man.

376
00:17:30.152 --> 00:17:31.533
- Strong words.

377
00:17:33.362 --> 00:17:35.640
I wonder are you
feeling convicted?

378
00:17:35.675 --> 00:17:36.917
- No. Shut up.

379
00:17:36.952 --> 00:17:38.264
- A lotta pressure
to put on one guy.

380
00:17:38.298 --> 00:17:39.506
killing someone and all.

381
00:17:39.541 --> 00:17:40.714
- Ha.
- Excuse me?

382
00:17:40.749 --> 00:17:42.578
- That's pretty rich
coming from you.

383
00:17:42.613 --> 00:17:43.407
- Uh-
- You're gonna

384
00:17:43.441 --> 00:17:44.960
knock me for killing?

385
00:17:44.994 --> 00:17:46.375
- Yes.

386
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.792
10 Commandments. Exodus
20:13. thou shalt not murder.

387
00:17:49.827 --> 00:17:52.416
- How many people
die by your hand?

388
00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:53.348
- My hand?

389
00:17:53.382 --> 00:17:55.177
I'm just a book after all.

390
00:17:55.212 --> 00:17:57.559
- Okay. you were
written by God. right?

391
00:17:57.593 --> 00:17:58.491
Yes.

392
00:17:58.525 --> 00:18:01.632
- And God is good. right?

393
00:18:01.666 --> 00:18:02.495
- Yes.

394
00:18:04.255 --> 00:18:06.326
- How many people
die by his hand?

395
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.192
- Some.
- Some?

396
00:18:10.227 --> 00:18:12.263
Tell me. was it 2 Kings

397
00:18:12.298 --> 00:18:15.922
when the Angel of the Lord
smote the Assyrian camp?

398
00:18:15.956 --> 00:18:16.854
- Yes.

399
00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:18.407
- Something like 100.000 people?

400
00:18:18.442 --> 00:18:19.236
- 185.000

401
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.652
- 185.000 people.

402
00:18:21.686 --> 00:18:22.825
- Yes. so. a lot.

403
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.448
- A lot.

404
00:18:24.482 --> 00:18:27.761
185.000 people. in one night.

405
00:18:27.796 --> 00:18:28.693
- Yes. not untrue.

406
00:18:28.728 --> 00:18:31.972
- Very true. according to you.

407
00:18:33.802 --> 00:18:36.322
Thou shalt not murder.
unless I say so.

408
00:18:36.356 --> 00:18:38.910
- Look! God gets
to make that call!

409
00:18:38.945 --> 00:18:40.567
I can tell you're
not a believer.

410
00:18:40.602 --> 00:18:41.396
- Hey. damn right.

411
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.397
- But I do know this:

412
00:18:42.431 --> 00:18:44.226
You did not create life.

413
00:18:44.261 --> 00:18:45.538
God did!

414
00:18:45.572 --> 00:18:47.056
He has the power to give life

415
00:18:47.091 --> 00:18:48.955
and he the authority
to take it away.

416
00:18:48.989 --> 00:18:50.474
You Pete. do not.

417
00:18:50.508 --> 00:18:52.579
For you to murder
someone in cold blood

418
00:18:52.614 --> 00:18:54.788
for selfish reasons is wrong.

419
00:19:01.278 --> 00:19:02.900
- You're right.

420
00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:04.004
- Yes. yes I am.

421
00:19:05.351 --> 00:19:07.111
- I need to be more obedient.

422
00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.354
- Yes. you do.

423
00:19:08.388 --> 00:19:11.702
- I need guidance.
I need scripture.

424
00:19:14.429 --> 00:19:16.189
- Praise Jesus.
- O my gosh.

425
00:19:16.224 --> 00:19:17.156
- Yes. Yes!

426
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.984
- Oh let's see.

427
00:19:18.018 --> 00:19:19.641
Guidance. laws.

428
00:19:20.573 --> 00:19:21.367
Leviticus!

429
00:19:21.401 --> 00:19:22.195
- Oo.

430
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.334
- Chapter 20?

431
00:19:23.369 --> 00:19:24.542
- Ya know?
- Let's see verse-

432
00:19:24.577 --> 00:19:25.819
- That's completely different.

433
00:19:25.854 --> 00:19:26.475
- Verse 10!
- See the Old Testament law

434
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.407
was fulfilled.

435
00:19:27.442 --> 00:19:28.650
We aren't under that covenant-

436
00:19:28.684 --> 00:19:30.065
If a man
commits adultery

437
00:19:30.099 --> 00:19:32.654
with the wife of his
neighbor. both the adulterer

438
00:19:32.688 --> 00:19:37.693
and the adulteress shall
surely be put to death.

439
00:19:41.835 --> 00:19:42.733
- You see?

440
00:19:42.767 --> 00:19:44.217
I'm just following orders.

441
00:19:45.598 --> 00:19:46.392
- Don't do that.

442
00:19:46.426 --> 00:19:47.600
- What? Follow orders?

443
00:19:47.634 --> 00:19:49.395
That's conve-
- Don't abuse me.

444
00:19:50.499 --> 00:19:52.260
Don't pluck out
verses and twist them.

445
00:19:54.676 --> 00:19:56.954
You're not humbling yourself.

446
00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:58.231
You're not learning.

447
00:19:58.266 --> 00:19:59.715
You're not even listening.

448
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.408
You're manipulating Scripture
because you're selfish.

449
00:20:02.442 --> 00:20:03.685
And it hurts.

450
00:20:03.719 --> 00:20:04.720
It hurts people.

451
00:20:04.755 --> 00:20:05.549
It hurts God.

452
00:20:05.583 --> 00:20:06.412
And it hurts you.

453
00:20:07.827 --> 00:20:10.657
What you said earlier.
all the blood on my hands.

454
00:20:10.692 --> 00:20:11.589
that's how it happens.

455
00:20:11.624 --> 00:20:12.556
- So this is my fault?

456
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.729
- It's about to be.

457
00:20:13.764 --> 00:20:15.006
You're about to kill someone.

458
00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:16.836
And I will not be used.

459
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.494
Either don't use
Scripture at all.

460
00:20:19.528 --> 00:20:21.496
or take it all as a whole.

461
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:22.566
All in context.

462
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.877
- Context?
- Yes.

463
00:20:25.154 --> 00:20:26.052
- You're saying I should take

464
00:20:26.086 --> 00:20:27.364
the whole chapter into account.

465
00:20:27.398 --> 00:20:28.227
- The whole book!

466
00:20:28.261 --> 00:20:29.711
- Right.

467
00:20:29.745 --> 00:20:31.126
And if I still don't get it.

468
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.267
If showing love to a thousand
generations in Exodus

469
00:20:34.302 --> 00:20:36.649
still isn't consistent
enough with killing witches

470
00:20:36.683 --> 00:20:39.272
also in Exodus. I should
read the whole Bible. right?

471
00:20:39.307 --> 00:20:40.446
- I highly recommend it.
- For context?

472
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.551
- For context.
- Great.

473
00:20:42.586 --> 00:20:44.829
And this is just a thought here.

474
00:20:44.864 --> 00:20:47.418
It feels like you're asking
me to do all the work for you.

475
00:20:47.453 --> 00:20:49.524
Justifying all your
contradictions with context.

476
00:20:49.558 --> 00:20:51.319
- Asking you to
read the whole thing

477
00:20:51.353 --> 00:20:52.906
doesn't seem that unfair.

478
00:20:52.941 --> 00:20:54.149
Imagine if I only listened
to half of what you said.

479
00:20:54.183 --> 00:20:55.530
- But it doesn't
stop there. does it?

480
00:20:55.564 --> 00:20:56.807
- What do you mean?

481
00:20:56.841 --> 00:20:58.326
- Well for context. for
true biblical context.

482
00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.672
I would have to consider
all the original languages

483
00:20:59.706 --> 00:21:00.914
and adaptations
you've been through.

484
00:21:00.949 --> 00:21:02.226
The Greek. the
Hebrew. the Aramaic.

485
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.745
- Sure. and not just the
languages. the cultures-

486
00:21:03.779 --> 00:21:05.712
- And then I can't forget
about the historical context.

487
00:21:05.747 --> 00:21:08.370
How you've been
interpreted since then.

488
00:21:08.405 --> 00:21:10.510
For which I would have to look
through thousands of years

489
00:21:10.545 --> 00:21:11.856
of church history
which. to be honest.

490
00:21:11.891 --> 00:21:14.065
had a lot of low
points don't ya think?

491
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.723
Between The Crusades. Joan of
Arc. pedophilia. et cetera.

492
00:21:16.758 --> 00:21:18.484
- Fair point:
interpretation is sloppy.

493
00:21:18.518 --> 00:21:20.417
What are you getting at?

494
00:21:20.451 --> 00:21:21.625
- Who do you expect to help

495
00:21:21.659 --> 00:21:24.421
when no one's qualified
to read you. Gid?

496
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.563
Are we supposed to
devote half our lives

497
00:21:28.597 --> 00:21:31.566
to justifying your stains
with centuries of context?

498
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.739
What is context?

499
00:21:32.774 --> 00:21:34.051
- Fine. let me
simplify it for you.

500
00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:34.983
- Please.

501
00:21:35.017 --> 00:21:35.915
- The context is that of love.

502
00:21:35.949 --> 00:21:37.157
- Love?

503
00:21:37.192 --> 00:21:38.676
Well that's a goddamn
catchall. isn't it?

504
00:22:15.679 --> 00:22:16.783
- So. what's the plan?

505
00:22:16.818 --> 00:22:18.026
- You know the plan.

506
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.614
- You check the parking
lot every few minutes

507
00:22:19.648 --> 00:22:21.512
and hope you get lucky?

508
00:22:21.547 --> 00:22:22.720
- Yep.

509
00:22:22.755 --> 00:22:24.688
- Ya know you could just
stand by the window.

510
00:22:24.722 --> 00:22:26.483
- Oh why don't I just
wave my gun around too.

511
00:22:26.517 --> 00:22:27.760
make sure they see me.

512
00:22:27.794 --> 00:22:29.313
- Mm.

513
00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:31.384
Then hopefully of all the
gin joints in all Chicago.

514
00:22:31.419 --> 00:22:34.318
Cindy shacks up with Leo
in this dump of a hotel.

515
00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:35.146
- I know she's coming.

516
00:22:35.181 --> 00:22:36.078
- Oo. did God tell you?

517
00:22:36.113 --> 00:22:37.977
- What. like a flash of light?

518
00:22:39.081 --> 00:22:42.015
No. I stick to
reality. thank you.

519
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.810
- Oh. like talking to a Bible.

520
00:22:46.537 --> 00:22:47.366
- Touché.

521
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.509
I followed her.

522
00:22:54.718 --> 00:22:56.340
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

523
00:22:59.516 --> 00:23:01.000
I kept telling myself

524
00:23:01.034 --> 00:23:02.898
that I was just making sure
she was safe. you know?

525
00:23:04.969 --> 00:23:06.419
Even when I followed her here.

526
00:23:08.904 --> 00:23:10.630
And then I followed
her here again.

527
00:23:12.218 --> 00:23:13.046
And again.

528
00:23:15.911 --> 00:23:19.467
This was their place.
Friday was their night.

529
00:23:20.675 --> 00:23:22.228
I checked in to the
room next door once.

530
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.439
It's stupid. but...

531
00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:31.720
it was nice hear
her laugh again.

532
00:23:36.656 --> 00:23:37.519
I confronted her.

533
00:23:40.384 --> 00:23:41.212
Six months.

534
00:23:42.869 --> 00:23:45.251
I called and sure enough.
there was a reservation.

535
00:23:45.285 --> 00:23:46.079
- Maybe you missed them.

536
00:23:46.114 --> 00:23:47.046
- I didn't miss them.

537
00:23:48.116 --> 00:23:49.151
I have an alarm clock.

538
00:23:49.186 --> 00:23:50.290
A clear view of the parking lot.

539
00:23:50.325 --> 00:23:52.396
I know what car she drives.

540
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.709
And just in case. I
told the desk clerk

541
00:23:54.743 --> 00:23:57.021
to call me when they check in.

542
00:23:57.056 --> 00:23:58.471
- Wow. very thorough.

543
00:23:58.506 --> 00:23:59.334
- Thanks.

544
00:23:59.368 --> 00:24:00.749
- So then what?

545
00:24:00.784 --> 00:24:01.681
When?

546
00:24:01.716 --> 00:24:02.993
- I mean after you shoot Leo

547
00:24:03.027 --> 00:24:04.926
and throw this bloody
note at your wife.

548
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.754
Then what?

549
00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:06.721
- Who knows.

550
00:24:06.755 --> 00:24:08.067
Maybe I'll go to a Cubs game.

551
00:24:08.101 --> 00:24:09.309
- Well. that'd be fun.

552
00:24:09.344 --> 00:24:10.483
- Yeah and I may
need a cigarette.

553
00:24:10.518 --> 00:24:11.657
You mind if I
borrow a few pages?

554
00:24:11.691 --> 00:24:13.417
Nothing important. just
Old Testament stuff.

555
00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:15.350
- Ha ha cheeky.

556
00:24:22.426 --> 00:24:25.912
You know. I couldn't
help but notice

557
00:24:25.947 --> 00:24:28.674
you know your way around
Scripture better than most.

558
00:24:29.847 --> 00:24:31.331
- O yeah?

559
00:24:31.366 --> 00:24:32.505
- Yeah.

560
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.782
And you don't strike
me as a religion major.

561
00:24:33.817 --> 00:24:35.059
- Why's that?

562
00:24:35.094 --> 00:24:37.476
- Religion majors
tend to be less...

563
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.063
Yes?

564
00:24:39.098 --> 00:24:40.271
- Disheveled.

565
00:24:42.584 --> 00:24:45.000
- You and I know very
different religion majors.

566
00:24:46.243 --> 00:24:47.520
Anyways it's a long story.

567
00:24:49.142 --> 00:24:49.971
- I got time.

568
00:24:56.253 --> 00:25:00.429
- My dad was a pastor.

569
00:25:02.604 --> 00:25:03.467
Was?

570
00:25:04.779 --> 00:25:07.920
- Yeah. he died a few years ago.

571
00:25:10.232 --> 00:25:13.442
Five. five years ago.

572
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.001
Highly aggressive early
onset Alzheimer's.

573
00:25:22.175 --> 00:25:23.073
- I'm sorry.

574
00:25:24.074 --> 00:25:24.902
- Thanks.

575
00:25:30.356 --> 00:25:31.495
We rushed the wedding.

576
00:25:34.049 --> 00:25:35.188
Wanted him to be there.

577
00:25:36.914 --> 00:25:38.882
He didn't remember
my name at the time.

578
00:25:41.229 --> 00:25:42.402
And Mom was a mess.

579
00:25:42.437 --> 00:25:44.197
she didn't make it
through the ceremony.

580
00:25:45.509 --> 00:25:47.062
And on top of all the dad stuff.

581
00:25:47.097 --> 00:25:50.583
Cindy wasn't a Christian which
Mom was just ballistic about.

582
00:25:52.999 --> 00:25:54.587
She thought she was immature.

583
00:25:59.592 --> 00:26:00.662
I guess she was right.

584
00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:08.705
My dad was one of the
best men that I ever knew.

585
00:26:09.809 --> 00:26:11.086
A real solid guy.

586
00:26:12.467 --> 00:26:15.366
And when he got sick.
I started to pray.

587
00:26:17.955 --> 00:26:18.853
And I prayed.

588
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.821
Every morning. every evening.

589
00:26:21.856 --> 00:26:23.685
Fasting. Bible
study. the whole bit.

590
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.238
Nothing. nothing. nothing.

591
00:26:27.413 --> 00:26:28.483
I was in a bad way.

592
00:26:31.348 --> 00:26:35.455
That's when I met Cindy.
and she lit up my life.

593
00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:37.147
Man. her singing. her dancing.

594
00:26:37.181 --> 00:26:38.631
She was fearless.

595
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.428
Fearless!

596
00:26:46.018 --> 00:26:47.778
I don't know. maybe I
needed something to love.

597
00:26:47.813 --> 00:26:49.884
or something to
save because my Dad.

598
00:26:51.092 --> 00:26:52.887
I couldn't save him
and it hurt so much.

599
00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:54.129
that I became numb.

600
00:26:58.513 --> 00:27:01.585
And my faith broke a little
more each day until finally.

601
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:06.176
I told God. that if Dad
got better. I'd be in.

602
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.902
And if he didn't.
then I'd be out.

603
00:27:12.596 --> 00:27:13.562
He's gone now.

604
00:27:18.602 --> 00:27:19.534
- How is your mom?

605
00:27:19.568 --> 00:27:20.397
- Terrible.

606
00:27:21.916 --> 00:27:23.055
She still prays for me.

607
00:27:23.089 --> 00:27:24.366
Prays for Dad. too.

608
00:27:25.782 --> 00:27:28.612
She thinks that if
she has enough faith

609
00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:29.924
he'll raise from the dead.

610
00:27:32.478 --> 00:27:34.100
Matthew 10. right?

611
00:27:34.135 --> 00:27:35.619
- That's not what I meant.

612
00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:37.069
- Well it doesn't matter
what you meant. all right?

613
00:27:37.103 --> 00:27:38.691
This is what happens when you
get shoved down the throat

614
00:27:38.726 --> 00:27:40.659
of vulnerable. desperate people.

615
00:27:42.833 --> 00:27:44.041
Raised from the dead?

616
00:27:44.076 --> 00:27:45.111
Isn't that crazy?

617
00:27:46.181 --> 00:27:47.389
And this is what I hate.

618
00:27:47.424 --> 00:27:48.736
I hate when all
of this faith crap

619
00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:50.047
gets in the way of what's real.

620
00:27:50.082 --> 00:27:51.428
You know?

621
00:27:51.462 --> 00:27:52.947
I mean. my poor mom may
be hung up on the fact

622
00:27:52.981 --> 00:27:54.396
that Dad's gonna come
back from the dead

623
00:27:54.431 --> 00:27:55.674
for the rest of her life.

624
00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:57.779
I wish she would just
accept it and move on.

625
00:27:57.814 --> 00:27:58.711
Dad's dead.

626
00:28:01.887 --> 00:28:06.201
I mean what am I supposed
to do with that. huh?

627
00:28:09.584 --> 00:28:10.412
- I don't know.

628
00:28:13.553 --> 00:28:14.554
- That's a first.

629
00:28:19.559 --> 00:28:21.492
- I hope your mom comes around.

630
00:28:21.527 --> 00:28:26.325
- Yeah. yeah I hope she's okay.

631
00:28:30.881 --> 00:28:31.710
- You know...

632
00:28:35.403 --> 00:28:40.097
I think there's a spot
in there where we agree.

633
00:28:41.547 --> 00:28:44.308
- That faith is a poisonous
substitute for reality?

634
00:28:45.447 --> 00:28:46.552
- No.

635
00:28:46.586 --> 00:28:47.415
Not there.

636
00:28:49.313 --> 00:28:53.904
That death is the worst.

637
00:28:56.148 --> 00:28:57.425
- Death's the worst.

638
00:28:58.702 --> 00:29:00.497
Yeah. I think I can
get behind that.

639
00:29:02.223 --> 00:29:04.190
- Not by design. you know?

640
00:29:04.225 --> 00:29:05.951
People weren't
originally made to die.

641
00:29:05.985 --> 00:29:07.884
- I got news for you friend.

642
00:29:07.918 --> 00:29:09.057
- I mean...

643
00:29:09.092 --> 00:29:13.027
Anyway. death is the worst.

644
00:29:13.993 --> 00:29:15.063
- Yeah.

645
00:29:15.098 --> 00:29:16.651
Yeah. it's pretty bad.

646
00:29:20.828 --> 00:29:21.656
- And yet.

647
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.624
- What?

648
00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:28.974
- I mean. we both agree
that death is a bad thing.

649
00:29:30.492 --> 00:29:31.597
You just said so yourself.

650
00:29:31.631 --> 00:29:33.288
It's. it's permanent.

651
00:29:33.323 --> 00:29:35.670
Your father. he can't come back.

652
00:29:35.704 --> 00:29:36.878
And that hurts.

653
00:29:39.363 --> 00:29:40.571
- Yes?

654
00:29:40.606 --> 00:29:43.160
- Then well Leo. I mean
he's not gonna be able

655
00:29:43.195 --> 00:29:44.127
to come back either.

656
00:29:44.161 --> 00:29:45.611
- Yes?

657
00:29:45.645 --> 00:29:47.440
- Are you gonna think about
your father while you kill Leo?

658
00:29:47.475 --> 00:29:48.821
What about his father.
- Yeah?

659
00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:50.271
- His family.
- Yeah?

660
00:29:50.305 --> 00:29:51.444
- This of all the damage
your father's death caused.

661
00:29:51.479 --> 00:29:53.239
- You're the worst.
you know that.

662
00:29:53.274 --> 00:29:55.448
Taking my pain and
guilting me with it.

663
00:29:55.483 --> 00:29:57.209
- So it's my fault
that you feel guilty?

664
00:29:57.243 --> 00:29:58.417
- No. no.

665
00:29:58.451 --> 00:29:59.694
- It has nothing
to do with the fact

666
00:29:59.728 --> 00:30:01.109
that you're about
to shoot someone.

667
00:30:01.144 --> 00:30:02.490
- That's real shitting
man. to use pain as a tool.

668
00:30:02.524 --> 00:30:03.560
- Not use. address!

669
00:30:03.594 --> 00:30:04.768
I'm addressing your pain.

670
00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:05.596
- You don't get to.

671
00:30:05.631 --> 00:30:07.081
- Pete. I can help.

672
00:30:07.115 --> 00:30:08.599
- I decide. you don't get
to force and manipulate me.

673
00:30:08.634 --> 00:30:10.084
Can you just stop
and think for one second?

674
00:30:10.118 --> 00:30:11.119
- You know you dig and dig.
you pretend like you care.

675
00:30:11.154 --> 00:30:12.362
But you just want to find an in.

676
00:30:12.396 --> 00:30:13.570
Isn't that right?
- Listen to me.

677
00:30:13.604 --> 00:30:14.364
- You just want to know
what makes me weak!

678
00:30:14.398 --> 00:30:15.330
- What if you die?

679
00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:21.992
- Screw you. man.

680
00:30:22.027 --> 00:30:23.338
- What if Leo has a gun?

681
00:30:23.373 --> 00:30:24.650
I mean. he knows you know.

682
00:30:24.684 --> 00:30:25.824
She probably told him. right?
- I don't care.

683
00:30:25.858 --> 00:30:26.479
- I mean. she would
have told him.

684
00:30:26.514 --> 00:30:27.687
- I don't care.

685
00:30:27.722 --> 00:30:28.481
You don't get to
tell me what to do.

686
00:30:28.516 --> 00:30:29.931
- Don't remind me.

687
00:30:29.966 --> 00:30:31.243
I just sit here offering
you words of truth and love-

688
00:30:31.277 --> 00:30:33.832
- You have no authority here!

689
00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:39.665
- Your loss.

690
00:30:46.465 --> 00:30:48.225
- Who the hell do
you think you are?

691
00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.192
- The Word of God.

692
00:30:49.226 --> 00:30:50.331
The Word of God?

693
00:30:50.365 --> 00:30:51.988
- Straight from the mouth.

694
00:30:52.022 --> 00:30:54.576
- You mean the mouth
of 40 violent dead men.

695
00:30:54.611 --> 00:30:56.406
- Who were inspired by
the Holy Spirit several-

696
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.234
- Oh good!

697
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:58.580
Insane violent dead men.

698
00:30:58.615 --> 00:31:00.030
Who got high on some

699
00:31:00.065 --> 00:31:01.514
Holy Spirit and wrote a book
- They weren't insane.

700
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:02.205
You think I'm insane?
- for a buncha straight men.

701
00:31:02.239 --> 00:31:02.895
- I am inspired.

702
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:04.138
I am the Bible.

703
00:31:04.172 --> 00:31:04.863
- You hurt people.
- I'm the Word of God!

704
00:31:04.897 --> 00:31:05.829
- John 1.

705
00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:08.487
Jesus is the Word of God.

706
00:31:11.593 --> 00:31:12.974
That's gotta be true. isn't it?

707
00:31:13.009 --> 00:31:13.872
- Yes.

708
00:31:14.942 --> 00:31:16.081
- You aren't Jesus. are you?

709
00:31:16.115 --> 00:31:18.186
- No.
- No. you're not the Father.

710
00:31:18.221 --> 00:31:19.325
or the Son or the Holy Spirit.

711
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.257
- I'm Scripture for God's sake.

712
00:31:20.292 --> 00:31:21.949
- Right. You're Scripture.

713
00:31:21.983 --> 00:31:23.916
You're the Word of God. but
you aren't the voice of God.

714
00:31:23.951 --> 00:31:25.021
you're not God himself.

715
00:31:25.055 --> 00:31:25.953
- Yes but you need the Word.

716
00:31:25.987 --> 00:31:27.057
- Like you need God?

717
00:31:27.092 --> 00:31:27.886
- Yes.

718
00:31:29.853 --> 00:31:30.992
No!
- Oh. so I don't need you?

719
00:31:31.027 --> 00:31:32.097
You only go so far.

720
00:31:32.131 --> 00:31:33.029
- Oh. trust me. I go pretty far.

721
00:31:33.063 --> 00:31:33.892
- Yeah. but not far enough.

722
00:31:33.926 --> 00:31:35.134
- I go pretty far.

723
00:31:35.169 --> 00:31:36.170
- Easy man. your Old
Testament's showing.

724
00:31:36.204 --> 00:31:37.102
- I go pretty far.

725
00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:18.074
Hey. I got a question.

726
00:32:19.247 --> 00:32:21.560
What's it like getting
to believe whatever?

727
00:32:21.594 --> 00:32:25.495
- I don't believe whatever.
I just don't believe in you.

728
00:32:28.015 --> 00:32:29.775
You're a cocky son of
a bitch. you know that.

729
00:32:29.809 --> 00:32:30.707
Look who's talking.

730
00:32:30.741 --> 00:32:31.950
- Yeah. look who's asking.

731
00:32:33.986 --> 00:32:36.989
- I mean it's just
so incredible.

732
00:32:37.024 --> 00:32:39.302
God lets people
believe anything.

733
00:32:41.718 --> 00:32:43.237
It's pretty great actually.

734
00:32:43.271 --> 00:32:44.100
- Yeah?

735
00:32:44.134 --> 00:32:45.618
Man. it's wild.

736
00:32:45.653 --> 00:32:50.658
Oh. what's the craziest
thing you ever believed?

737
00:32:51.866 --> 00:32:52.694
- The Bible.

738
00:32:53.557 --> 00:32:55.007
- Fine.

739
00:32:55.042 --> 00:32:57.389
What's the second craziest
thing you ever believed?

740
00:32:58.493 --> 00:32:59.839
- You can't judge me. okay?

741
00:32:59.874 --> 00:33:00.702
- Okay.

742
00:33:02.221 --> 00:33:04.913
- When I was a kid I believed
that Pokemon were real.

743
00:33:04.948 --> 00:33:05.845
- No way!

744
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.019
- Yeah.

745
00:33:07.054 --> 00:33:08.020
- Like really
believed it though.

746
00:33:08.055 --> 00:33:09.435
- Oh yeah man. I was positive

747
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.334
I was gonna catch a
Charmander in my backyard.

748
00:33:12.507 --> 00:33:13.336
- Wow!

749
00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:15.924
What's a Pokemon?

750
00:33:17.892 --> 00:33:21.033
- Oh. it's this
super fun Satan thing

751
00:33:21.068 --> 00:33:22.552
that people used to
do on the weekends.

752
00:33:22.586 --> 00:33:23.346
- What?

753
00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.554
- Oh. yeah.

754
00:33:24.588 --> 00:33:26.142
You go off into the deep
grass. maybe a cave.

755
00:33:26.176 --> 00:33:29.800
You summon up a Scyther.
Pinsirs. Mr. Mime.

756
00:33:29.835 --> 00:33:31.837
- Pete. you were a
Satan worshipper?

757
00:33:31.871 --> 00:33:32.941
- Nope.

758
00:33:32.976 --> 00:33:33.908
I Gotcha.

759
00:33:33.942 --> 00:33:35.047
- Ugh.

760
00:33:35.082 --> 00:33:35.875
- Ugh?

761
00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:36.980
Use your words. Gid.

762
00:33:37.946 --> 00:33:39.017
You're better than that.

763
00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:39.879
- Pokemon.

764
00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:43.538
- Okay what about you?

765
00:33:43.573 --> 00:33:44.781
What's the craziest
thing you believe.

766
00:33:44.815 --> 00:33:45.713
- Oh.

767
00:33:45.747 --> 00:33:48.060
I mean. I believe myself.

768
00:33:48.095 --> 00:33:50.097
I'm kinda locked in.

769
00:33:50.131 --> 00:33:50.959
I don't really change.

770
00:33:50.994 --> 00:33:52.582
That's why I asked you.

771
00:33:52.616 --> 00:33:54.101
I'm a codified
system of beliefs.

772
00:33:54.135 --> 00:33:55.550
- Exactly. that's what I mean.

773
00:33:55.585 --> 00:33:59.209
What's the craziest codified
belief you got in you?

774
00:33:59.244 --> 00:34:00.383
- Oh. that's tough!

775
00:34:01.625 --> 00:34:04.766
Well there's an angel
with a cow face.

776
00:34:04.801 --> 00:34:06.113
Ezekiel. it's trippy.

777
00:34:07.493 --> 00:34:10.634
A 7-headed dragon
chasing a pregnant woman.

778
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:13.120
Revelation. also trippy.

779
00:34:13.154 --> 00:34:16.882
And then there's the
Leviathan and the Nephilim.

780
00:34:19.678 --> 00:34:23.026
Honestly. the
craziest thing to me.

781
00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:26.823
is that God. big infinite God.

782
00:34:26.857 --> 00:34:31.207
let these itty bitty little
people make infinite choices.

783
00:34:32.277 --> 00:34:33.519
Like believing whatever.

784
00:34:36.557 --> 00:34:38.352
That's it. that's
the craziest thing.

785
00:34:41.044 --> 00:34:45.013
- You also can sit back and
judge us when we choose wrong.

786
00:34:46.394 --> 00:34:48.120
- You don't always choose wrong.

787
00:34:48.155 --> 00:34:49.363
- Not that you'd know.

788
00:34:49.397 --> 00:34:51.296
- Come on. if there
is one thing I know

789
00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:52.987
it's right and wrong.

790
00:34:53.021 --> 00:34:54.230
- Please.

791
00:34:54.264 --> 00:34:55.196
- Really? You disagree?

792
00:34:55.231 --> 00:34:56.473
- Yes I disagree.

793
00:34:56.508 --> 00:34:58.165
Morality in the Bible
is all over the place.

794
00:34:58.199 --> 00:35:01.789
and morality through God.
well that's impossible.

795
00:35:01.823 --> 00:35:02.721
- What?

796
00:35:02.755 --> 00:35:04.274
- Oh yeah. the idea of morality

797
00:35:04.309 --> 00:35:05.965
and the God of the Bible
don't fit together.

798
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.657
- That's ridiculous.
- It's true.

799
00:35:07.691 --> 00:35:08.968
- Explain.
- No.

800
00:35:09.003 --> 00:35:09.797
- Come on.

801
00:35:09.831 --> 00:35:11.385
- Ugh.
- Ugh?

802
00:35:11.419 --> 00:35:12.834
You scared?

803
00:35:12.869 --> 00:35:13.870
- No.

804
00:35:13.904 --> 00:35:15.354
- Okay.

805
00:35:15.389 --> 00:35:19.186
- Fine. but if I win this one.
you have to leave me alone.

806
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.428
- What?

807
00:35:20.463 --> 00:35:21.636
- If I can prove to
you that morality

808
00:35:21.671 --> 00:35:24.191
and the God of the Bible
don't fit together.

809
00:35:24.225 --> 00:35:27.815
then you go back in
the drawer; talk over.

810
00:35:27.849 --> 00:35:29.955
- Okay. Mr. Religion Major.

811
00:35:29.989 --> 00:35:34.166
And if I win. then you have
to take me to a Cubs game.

812
00:35:34.201 --> 00:35:35.063
- No.
- Yep!

813
00:35:35.098 --> 00:35:35.892
- Not happening.

814
00:35:35.926 --> 00:35:37.307
- Please?

815
00:35:37.342 --> 00:35:38.343
- People don't bring
Bibles to baseball games.

816
00:35:38.377 --> 00:35:39.620
- You can put me in a sleeve.

817
00:35:39.654 --> 00:35:40.966
everybody'll think
I'm a dictionary.

818
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.347
- People don't bring
dictionaries to baseball games-

819
00:35:42.381 --> 00:35:43.831
- Please. please.
please. please!

820
00:35:43.865 --> 00:35:46.730
please. please. please. please

821
00:35:46.765 --> 00:35:48.870
please. please. please

822
00:35:48.905 --> 00:35:49.733
please. please. please. please

823
00:35:49.768 --> 00:35:50.562
- Fine.
- Yes!

824
00:35:50.596 --> 00:35:51.977
Okay.

825
00:35:53.565 --> 00:35:56.740
Prosecution takes
opening arguments. sir.

826
00:35:56.775 --> 00:35:59.605
- Let's pretend that God
exists. and that morality.

827
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.366
right and wrong. flow from him.

828
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:05.197
It comes from his
magical God beard.

829
00:36:05.232 --> 00:36:06.647
Whatever.
- Love it.

830
00:36:06.681 --> 00:36:10.029
- Except that if God
sets the standard

831
00:36:10.064 --> 00:36:12.204
for moral and immoral.
then right and wrong

832
00:36:12.239 --> 00:36:14.586
will change at the snap
of his God-fingers.

833
00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.690
- Faulty premise.

834
00:36:15.725 --> 00:36:17.244
God doesn't change.

835
00:36:17.278 --> 00:36:20.419
Morality stays the same
because God stays the same.

836
00:36:20.454 --> 00:36:21.800
Point for Gideon.

837
00:36:21.834 --> 00:36:22.732
- What about Abraham?

838
00:36:22.766 --> 00:36:23.560
- My Abraham?

839
00:36:23.595 --> 00:36:24.596
- Yes! Your Abraham.

840
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.805
God asked him to kill his son.

841
00:36:26.839 --> 00:36:27.978
Yes?
- Yes. but God stopped him.

842
00:36:28.013 --> 00:36:29.187
- Exactly!

843
00:36:29.221 --> 00:36:30.602
He asked him and
then he stopped him.

844
00:36:30.636 --> 00:36:32.051
He changed his mind.

845
00:36:32.086 --> 00:36:32.880
- Point for Pete!

846
00:36:32.914 --> 00:36:33.708
- Objection!

847
00:36:33.743 --> 00:36:34.744
- Overruled!

848
00:36:34.778 --> 00:36:36.539
He's either a liar or he's sick.

849
00:36:36.573 --> 00:36:40.301
How. how then can I rely
on God for moral guidance?

850
00:36:40.336 --> 00:36:42.338
His morality is
constantly shifting.

851
00:36:42.372 --> 00:36:43.201
Two points for Pete!

852
00:36:43.235 --> 00:36:44.754
- Okay. okay.

853
00:36:45.755 --> 00:36:46.652
My turn.

854
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.448
The defense begins.

855
00:36:51.243 --> 00:36:52.175
Let's zoom out.

856
00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.866
- Hate it.

857
00:36:53.901 --> 00:36:58.008
- Now you say God
and his morality are
constantly shifting.

858
00:36:59.113 --> 00:37:00.494
But to say that
something is shifting

859
00:37:00.528 --> 00:37:02.358
implies that you
are on stable ground

860
00:37:02.392 --> 00:37:04.774
and able to perceive said shift.

861
00:37:04.808 --> 00:37:06.085
Your argument acknowledges

862
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.156
that there's a stable
objective morality.

863
00:37:08.191 --> 00:37:09.641
Yes?
- Proceed.

864
00:37:09.675 --> 00:37:11.470
- So there's an immovable
code of right and wrong.

865
00:37:11.505 --> 00:37:13.300
- Correct.
- We agree.

866
00:37:13.334 --> 00:37:15.302
But who defines that code?

867
00:37:15.336 --> 00:37:18.650
Either God is shifting.
and you are stable.

868
00:37:18.684 --> 00:37:22.205
Or you are shifting.
and God is stable.

869
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.206
It's like the sun.

870
00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:25.726
It looks like the sun is rising.

871
00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.280
when in fact it's
you that's moving.

872
00:37:28.315 --> 00:37:30.524
Now if I have to guess
which one is stable

873
00:37:30.558 --> 00:37:34.182
between you and God. I choose
the creator of the universe

874
00:37:34.217 --> 00:37:35.805
not the guy with the gun.

875
00:37:35.839 --> 00:37:37.047
Two points to two!

876
00:37:37.082 --> 00:37:38.842
- Let's bring it back
to morality. though.

877
00:37:38.877 --> 00:37:39.912
Shall we?

878
00:37:39.947 --> 00:37:41.949
Remember context?

879
00:37:41.983 --> 00:37:45.642
You bend over backwards to
qualify God's decisions.

880
00:37:45.677 --> 00:37:48.576
God violates my conscience!

881
00:37:48.611 --> 00:37:51.752
Clearly. then. I must have
a moral measuring stick

882
00:37:51.786 --> 00:37:52.994
apart from God.

883
00:37:53.029 --> 00:37:54.202
Point!

884
00:37:54.237 --> 00:37:55.652
- And who made your
measuring stick?

885
00:37:55.687 --> 00:37:57.930
You're appealing to a moral
code without an author.

886
00:37:57.965 --> 00:37:59.311
A substance without a source.

887
00:37:59.346 --> 00:38:01.382
An effect without a cause.

888
00:38:01.417 --> 00:38:02.659
Point!
- Not necessarily.

889
00:38:02.694 --> 00:38:04.799
- Pete. you're not
looking to disprove God.

890
00:38:04.834 --> 00:38:06.076
You're looking for a better god.

891
00:38:06.111 --> 00:38:07.457
- Damn right.

892
00:38:07.492 --> 00:38:09.287
Your god is an objectively
bad communicator.

893
00:38:09.321 --> 00:38:10.771
Point!

894
00:38:10.805 --> 00:38:12.945
- Oh so he is moral. you
just don't understand him.

895
00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:13.774
Point!

896
00:38:13.808 --> 00:38:14.637
He ties the game.

897
00:38:16.086 --> 00:38:17.295
- Fine.

898
00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:20.539
You're saying God
is always moral.

899
00:38:20.574 --> 00:38:21.920
- No. he defines moral.

900
00:38:21.954 --> 00:38:23.162
- Whatever.

901
00:38:23.197 --> 00:38:26.821
So all I need to do is
find one example of God

902
00:38:26.856 --> 00:38:29.341
not being moral. and I win.

903
00:38:31.516 --> 00:38:32.793
- Good luck.

904
00:38:32.827 --> 00:38:35.968
- Okay. Genocide.

905
00:38:37.625 --> 00:38:38.833
- Hmm.

906
00:38:38.868 --> 00:38:41.767
- Killing children
as part of a plague.

907
00:38:43.148 --> 00:38:47.255
Sacking Canaan. and
calling it Promised Land.

908
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:51.225
Drowning all of humanity.
and oh look a rainbow.

909
00:38:55.402 --> 00:38:56.817
These are war crimes.

910
00:38:56.851 --> 00:39:00.096
I say these are objectively
terrible things to do.

911
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:00.924
Terrible.

912
00:39:00.959 --> 00:39:02.167
Do you agree?

913
00:39:02.201 --> 00:39:03.030
- I agree.

914
00:39:04.065 --> 00:39:05.066
- So I win?

915
00:39:05.101 --> 00:39:06.309
- No!

916
00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:08.138
While these things are
terrible and horrifying.

917
00:39:08.173 --> 00:39:10.175
they must have been much
better than the alternative.

918
00:39:10.209 --> 00:39:11.107
- What is what precisely?

919
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:12.280
- I don't know.

920
00:39:12.315 --> 00:39:13.109
- What?

921
00:39:13.143 --> 00:39:13.937
- I don't know!

922
00:39:13.972 --> 00:39:15.387
And that's my point.

923
00:39:15.422 --> 00:39:16.699
We don't know what the
alternative would have been.

924
00:39:16.733 --> 00:39:18.804
A world without freedom?

925
00:39:18.839 --> 00:39:19.840
Greater evil?

926
00:39:19.874 --> 00:39:21.393
No consequence for injustice?

927
00:39:21.428 --> 00:39:22.877
Who knows.

928
00:39:22.912 --> 00:39:24.085
But the answer is certainly
not that God is immoral.

929
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.709
God is good definitionally.

930
00:39:26.743 --> 00:39:29.815
he made goodness. he
can't not be good!

931
00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:31.541
It's like asking a
triangle to be a square!

932
00:39:31.576 --> 00:39:33.405
- But he's changed
his mind before.

933
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.027
- From your point of view.

934
00:39:38.272 --> 00:39:40.585
And you could too if you wanted.

935
00:39:45.037 --> 00:39:46.901
- You just pivoted
off of morality.

936
00:39:46.936 --> 00:39:48.558
- You just pivoted
off of murder.

937
00:39:56.773 --> 00:39:58.534
- You're a piece of
work. you know that?

938
00:39:58.568 --> 00:39:59.776
- You kidding me?

939
00:39:59.811 --> 00:40:00.570
I'm an all-time
best seller baby.

940
00:40:00.605 --> 00:40:01.399
I'm good at this.

941
00:40:01.433 --> 00:40:02.330
- That I did not say.

942
00:40:02.365 --> 00:40:03.746
- Here. let me prove it to ya.

943
00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.369
You can go into some
prayer or meditation time.

944
00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:07.819
I'll give you some
juicy verse to chew on.

945
00:40:07.853 --> 00:40:10.131
- I'll get all teary eyed
and start confessing?

946
00:40:10.166 --> 00:40:11.339
My God!
- Yes!

947
00:40:11.374 --> 00:40:13.100
Then the Holy Spirit
can come and comfort you

948
00:40:13.134 --> 00:40:15.447
like a loving father holding
his sweet precious son.

949
00:40:15.482 --> 00:40:16.448
- Oh you mean Jesus.

950
00:40:18.968 --> 00:40:19.900
- Would you stop?

951
00:40:22.868 --> 00:40:24.387
- I swear I will throw
you out that window.

952
00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:25.215
- Oh would you please?

953
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:26.424
I'd see the world!

954
00:40:26.458 --> 00:40:27.632
- You're unbelievable.
- That's not true.

955
00:40:27.666 --> 00:40:28.771
Hundreds of millions of
people believe in me.

956
00:40:28.805 --> 00:40:29.979
- Not me.

957
00:40:30.013 --> 00:40:30.704
- Yes. you've made
that abundantly clear.

958
00:40:30.738 --> 00:40:31.532
- Good.

959
00:40:31.567 --> 00:40:32.395
- Sigh.

960
00:41:06.222 --> 00:41:08.120
Pete. you've said a lot

961
00:41:09.743 --> 00:41:11.607
about how wrong I am.

962
00:41:12.987 --> 00:41:15.645
You've got a lot of
things you don't believe.

963
00:41:17.405 --> 00:41:20.374
What exactly do you believe?

964
00:41:24.689 --> 00:41:25.690
- I believe...

965
00:41:31.558 --> 00:41:36.424
The truth is I feel the
happiest when I do something.

966
00:41:39.704 --> 00:41:41.119
I never felt happy with God.

967
00:41:44.156 --> 00:41:47.988
I felt afraid with God.
I felt alone with God.

968
00:41:49.817 --> 00:41:51.854
I feel the safest
when I rely on myself.

969
00:41:51.888 --> 00:41:53.718
And I'm not good.

970
00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.412
but I want to be.

971
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.966
I want to know myself.

972
00:42:01.001 --> 00:42:02.036
Improve myself!

973
00:42:02.071 --> 00:42:04.142
And religion. God.

974
00:42:04.176 --> 00:42:04.970
God.

975
00:42:06.351 --> 00:42:08.974
Any god that damns humanity
for eating an apple

976
00:42:09.009 --> 00:42:12.184
in pursuit of knowledge
is no god of mine.

977
00:42:13.669 --> 00:42:15.567
Anything that limits
personal responsibility.

978
00:42:15.602 --> 00:42:18.259
self-improvement through
self reflection is wrong.

979
00:42:18.294 --> 00:42:20.641
is inadequate and it is evil.

980
00:42:20.676 --> 00:42:23.368
Religion is just the fog of war

981
00:42:23.402 --> 00:42:25.543
that separates
mankind from himself.

982
00:42:29.581 --> 00:42:30.927
It's funny.

983
00:42:30.962 --> 00:42:32.860
It's kinda like what
you said earlier.

984
00:42:34.517 --> 00:42:35.553
I believe in me.

985
00:42:38.003 --> 00:42:38.832
- Me.

986
00:42:41.697 --> 00:42:42.560
Self.

987
00:42:44.216 --> 00:42:45.321
That's all that I am.

988
00:42:46.667 --> 00:42:48.013
- What if you're not enough?

989
00:42:48.048 --> 00:42:49.394
For what exactly.

990
00:42:49.428 --> 00:42:52.017
- Everything you
believe is based on you.

991
00:42:53.432 --> 00:42:54.744
What if you're not enough?

992
00:42:54.779 --> 00:42:55.607
- For what?

993
00:42:55.642 --> 00:42:56.470
For living. dying-

994
00:42:56.504 --> 00:42:57.333
- Let me rephrase.

995
00:42:57.367 --> 00:43:00.232
Pete. you're not enough.

996
00:43:02.441 --> 00:43:04.098
If you are trying to
shoulder the weight

997
00:43:04.133 --> 00:43:08.586
of justifying your
own existence. it's
going to kill you.

998
00:43:11.865 --> 00:43:15.869
But. you know. when you fail.

999
00:43:15.903 --> 00:43:18.768
When! Not if.

1000
00:43:18.803 --> 00:43:19.873
You don't measure up.

1001
00:43:21.391 --> 00:43:24.636
God loves you with
his whole heart.

1002
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.053
He paid a ridiculous
price to be with you.

1003
00:43:28.088 --> 00:43:29.917
to be your justice.

1004
00:43:29.952 --> 00:43:30.918
He loves you.

1005
00:43:30.953 --> 00:43:32.230
- There is no God.

1006
00:43:34.128 --> 00:43:34.957
- Come on!

1007
00:43:38.029 --> 00:43:38.857
Okay.

1008
00:43:40.238 --> 00:43:41.066
Tell me this.

1009
00:43:41.964 --> 00:43:43.655
If you knew there was a god.

1010
00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:47.486
a loving God up there.
would you admit it?

1011
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.937
Seriously?

1012
00:43:53.078 --> 00:43:54.286
See. you're not
looking for truth.

1013
00:43:54.321 --> 00:43:55.253
for what's real.

1014
00:43:56.392 --> 00:43:57.565
You don't want
there to be a god.

1015
00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.395
You can't believe that
someone loves you.

1016
00:43:59.429 --> 00:44:00.499
You can't accept it.

1017
00:44:03.157 --> 00:44:06.091
You know what. I think
you know there's a god.

1018
00:44:06.126 --> 00:44:07.023
Somewhere deep down.

1019
00:44:07.058 --> 00:44:08.300
- You don't know what I know.

1020
00:44:08.335 --> 00:44:09.785
- At least you're
pretty darn sure.

1021
00:44:09.819 --> 00:44:11.200
And it feels safer to treat
it like some big question mark

1022
00:44:11.234 --> 00:44:12.719
because of what if would mean.

1023
00:44:15.031 --> 00:44:16.619
Look. Pete.

1024
00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:18.863
I don't think you're in an
existential philosophy crisis.

1025
00:44:18.897 --> 00:44:20.071
I think you're in pain.

1026
00:44:21.624 --> 00:44:24.869
And there's a good. big
God up there who loves you.

1027
00:44:24.903 --> 00:44:25.697
Let him in.

1028
00:44:25.732 --> 00:44:26.664
- "Let him in"?

1029
00:44:28.251 --> 00:44:29.667
"I know the plans
I have for you".

1030
00:44:29.701 --> 00:44:31.047
"Let go and let God."

1031
00:44:32.255 --> 00:44:34.499
It's all the same
message. isn't it?

1032
00:44:34.533 --> 00:44:35.983
Be passive!

1033
00:44:36.018 --> 00:44:38.123
Stop trying to effect your own
life and trust in the thing

1034
00:44:38.158 --> 00:44:40.574
that disappears the second
you start looking for it.

1035
00:44:40.608 --> 00:44:43.681
You asked me. if there was
a God would I admit it?

1036
00:44:46.407 --> 00:44:47.201
Yes!

1037
00:44:48.651 --> 00:44:49.825
Of course.

1038
00:44:49.859 --> 00:44:51.136
You don't think I
want to be real?

1039
00:44:52.931 --> 00:44:55.071
You don't think I spent
every Sunday. every dinner.

1040
00:44:55.106 --> 00:44:56.694
Christmas. every god damn second

1041
00:44:56.728 --> 00:44:58.212
with my father
drinking the Kool-aid?

1042
00:44:58.247 --> 00:45:00.042
I was in the fold. man.

1043
00:45:01.181 --> 00:45:03.045
You talk like. I
know there's a God.

1044
00:45:03.079 --> 00:45:03.977
but I wish there wasn't.

1045
00:45:04.011 --> 00:45:05.219
No!

1046
00:45:05.254 --> 00:45:07.325
I wish God was real. but
where the fuck is he?

1047
00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.017
Your God and your religion

1048
00:45:10.052 --> 00:45:12.157
kept telling me the
same thing. be passive.

1049
00:45:12.192 --> 00:45:13.849
It's like this disease
that stuck to me

1050
00:45:13.883 --> 00:45:14.815
even when I left. and I'm done.

1051
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:16.748
I'm done being passive.

1052
00:45:16.783 --> 00:45:18.025
I was passive with Cindy.

1053
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:20.545
And I will not be
passive with Leo.

1054
00:45:20.579 --> 00:45:21.615
- Is there a god?

1055
00:45:21.649 --> 00:45:23.134
- Why are you torturing me?

1056
00:45:24.791 --> 00:45:27.276
I already broke myself
when I left Christianity.

1057
00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:28.518
And it hurt.

1058
00:45:28.553 --> 00:45:29.174
And now you want
to break me again?

1059
00:45:29.209 --> 00:45:30.003
Why. what for?

1060
00:45:30.037 --> 00:45:30.831
- Is there a god?

1061
00:45:30.866 --> 00:45:32.384
- I don't know.

1062
00:45:32.419 --> 00:45:34.421
Do you
believe there's a god?

1063
00:45:41.669 --> 00:45:42.498
- Yes.

1064
00:45:46.019 --> 00:45:47.641
- You're tired of being passive?

1065
00:45:48.538 --> 00:45:50.471
Pursue God.

1066
00:45:50.506 --> 00:45:51.403
Get up.

1067
00:45:51.438 --> 00:45:53.578
Start walking. run to him.

1068
00:45:53.612 --> 00:45:55.476
I'm not trying to torture you.

1069
00:45:55.511 --> 00:45:56.408
I'm trying to help you.

1070
00:45:56.443 --> 00:45:57.824
- I don't need your help.

1071
00:45:57.858 --> 00:45:59.411
- 'Cause you're just
doing so great right now?

1072
00:45:59.446 --> 00:46:01.413
- No. because all
you've got are words.

1073
00:46:02.414 --> 00:46:03.346
And all he's got...

1074
00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:05.693
He's not even here!

1075
00:46:05.728 --> 00:46:06.798
You think he'll help me?

1076
00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:08.938
I've heard that before.

1077
00:46:08.973 --> 00:46:09.870
I'm still waiting
for him to show up.

1078
00:46:09.905 --> 00:46:11.354
- What would you ask of him?

1079
00:46:11.389 --> 00:46:12.770
To come in the flesh?

1080
00:46:12.804 --> 00:46:15.117
To sacrifice himself.
to be crucified.

1081
00:46:15.151 --> 00:46:16.049
just so he could be with you?

1082
00:46:16.083 --> 00:46:17.602
- No. I want him here. now.

1083
00:46:17.636 --> 00:46:20.570
- Okay. so if God was here
right now. you would stop?

1084
00:46:23.159 --> 00:46:23.988
- Yes.

1085
00:46:25.092 --> 00:46:26.128
- Great!

1086
00:46:26.162 --> 00:46:27.025
Pete.

1087
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.061
He is.

1088
00:46:28.095 --> 00:46:28.924
Here.

1089
00:46:28.958 --> 00:46:30.097
Now.

1090
00:46:30.132 --> 00:46:30.995
In this very room.
- No. Not invisible god.

1091
00:46:31.029 --> 00:46:32.444
Real God.

1092
00:46:32.479 --> 00:46:34.895
You talk about a relationship.
God becoming flesh.

1093
00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:35.758
Why not now?

1094
00:46:35.793 --> 00:46:36.586
Why not here?

1095
00:46:36.621 --> 00:46:37.449
Why am I not enough?

1096
00:46:37.484 --> 00:46:38.692
- No Pete. that's not-

1097
00:46:38.726 --> 00:46:40.038
- I mean part a sea.
burn a bush. be here.

1098
00:46:40.073 --> 00:46:41.557
Give me a sign.

1099
00:46:41.591 --> 00:46:43.214
- You've been talking to the
Bible for the last 30 minutes.

1100
00:46:43.248 --> 00:46:44.663
How much more of a
sign do you want?

1101
00:46:44.698 --> 00:46:49.703
- We have talked
before. many times.

1102
00:46:50.428 --> 00:46:51.670
- Then you should know!

1103
00:46:51.705 --> 00:46:53.293
You've got to let go.

1104
00:46:53.327 --> 00:46:54.121
Trust him.

1105
00:46:54.156 --> 00:46:54.984
- Trust him.

1106
00:46:56.123 --> 00:46:57.228
Do you have any idea
what that means?

1107
00:46:57.262 --> 00:46:58.056
- Of course. I do.

1108
00:46:58.091 --> 00:46:59.609
It means to have faith.

1109
00:46:59.644 --> 00:47:00.956
Hebrews 11:1.

1110
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:02.060
Now faith is being sure-
- No Gideon.

1111
00:47:02.095 --> 00:47:03.199
do you know what that means?

1112
00:47:03.234 --> 00:47:04.442
- I just said-
- No. Gideon.

1113
00:47:04.476 --> 00:47:05.857
Do you know what it
means to trust God

1114
00:47:05.892 --> 00:47:08.722
when your own father
doesn't remember your name?

1115
00:47:08.756 --> 00:47:11.242
Or what it means to trust God
when you argue with your mom

1116
00:47:11.276 --> 00:47:12.726
about whether to
plan the funeral

1117
00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.210
because she thinks Dad
will raise from the dead?

1118
00:47:14.245 --> 00:47:15.833
Or what is means to trust God

1119
00:47:15.867 --> 00:47:18.421
when the woman you love
leaves you for another man?

1120
00:47:19.767 --> 00:47:21.114
Do you have any idea?

1121
00:47:23.426 --> 00:47:24.876
- Look. I know you've had pain-

1122
00:47:24.911 --> 00:47:27.775
- No. no you do not know.
and that is what I am saying.

1123
00:47:28.949 --> 00:47:30.295
Tell me when you felt pain.

1124
00:47:31.469 --> 00:47:34.299
Talk to me as someone
who had to trust God

1125
00:47:34.334 --> 00:47:35.507
when it was impossible.

1126
00:47:35.542 --> 00:47:36.439
How did you do it?

1127
00:47:44.758 --> 00:47:46.864
Who are you to talk to
me about trusting God?

1128
00:47:46.898 --> 00:47:47.692
- I'm. I'm his Word.

1129
00:47:47.726 --> 00:47:48.900
- His Word?

1130
00:47:48.935 --> 00:47:50.488
Well. do me a favor: go
get God and bring him.

1131
00:47:50.522 --> 00:47:51.869
He lost a son. right?

1132
00:47:53.042 --> 00:47:54.285
I'll talk to him.

1133
00:47:54.319 --> 00:47:55.389
But you. you've got
no skin in the game.

1134
00:47:55.424 --> 00:47:56.218
You're a tool.

1135
00:47:56.252 --> 00:47:57.771
A hammer left by God.

1136
00:47:57.805 --> 00:47:58.703
- Look. I'm his Word-

1137
00:47:58.737 --> 00:47:59.531
- And you are not enough.

1138
00:47:59.566 --> 00:48:00.463
- I'm trying-

1139
00:48:00.498 --> 00:48:03.087
- And you are not enough!

1140
00:48:24.073 --> 00:48:24.902
What?

1141
00:48:30.079 --> 00:48:31.080
- You don't.

1142
00:48:32.806 --> 00:48:33.980
You can't...

1143
00:48:34.014 --> 00:48:35.222
- What? I can't
grasp the context-

1144
00:48:35.257 --> 00:48:36.948
- You can't see
how lucky you are.

1145
00:48:42.402 --> 00:48:43.299
You are correct.

1146
00:48:46.026 --> 00:48:47.096
I am words.

1147
00:48:48.546 --> 00:48:50.720
And for all my words

1148
00:48:50.755 --> 00:48:53.827
I'm at best a tool.

1149
00:48:55.553 --> 00:48:58.728
at worst a weapon.

1150
00:49:01.628 --> 00:49:02.491
Or a cigarette.

1151
00:49:04.562 --> 00:49:08.393
Don't get me wrong.
I got a sweet gig.

1152
00:49:08.428 --> 00:49:09.843
God works through me.

1153
00:49:09.877 --> 00:49:10.706
It's great.

1154
00:49:11.603 --> 00:49:12.432
But you...

1155
00:49:14.917 --> 00:49:17.885
you can choose.

1156
00:49:21.337 --> 00:49:22.476
Grow.

1157
00:49:22.511 --> 00:49:23.684
Change!

1158
00:49:23.719 --> 00:49:27.171
Connect to the God
who made the universe.

1159
00:49:30.277 --> 00:49:32.452
You've got this chance.
this opportunity

1160
00:49:34.557 --> 00:49:36.594
to trust him in the mystery.

1161
00:49:39.045 --> 00:49:42.082
to have faith when
life gets blurry.

1162
00:49:48.157 --> 00:49:48.986
It's beautiful!

1163
00:49:54.543 --> 00:49:55.785
I know it sucks.

1164
00:49:58.443 --> 00:49:59.272
Or...

1165
00:50:13.217 --> 00:50:16.151
You're right. I don't.

1166
00:50:18.705 --> 00:50:21.501
I guess it sounds like it sucks.

1167
00:50:29.923 --> 00:50:31.442
But it's beautiful too.

1168
00:50:52.842 --> 00:50:54.741
- Can you save me. Gid?

1169
00:51:06.477 --> 00:51:08.996
- For God so loved the world

1170
00:51:09.031 --> 00:51:10.688
that he gave his
only begotten son-

1171
00:51:10.722 --> 00:51:11.861
- I've already read it.

1172
00:51:20.249 --> 00:51:23.356
- You've gotta. you
gotta believe it.

1173
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:31.640
come into a saving acceptance
of the truth of it.

1174
00:51:31.674 --> 00:51:34.091
an intimate knowing of God.

1175
00:51:39.682 --> 00:51:40.511
- God.

1176
00:51:57.873 --> 00:51:59.323
You can't save me.

1177
00:52:05.605 --> 00:52:06.399
- No.

1178
00:52:12.232 --> 00:52:13.716
Pete-

1179
00:52:21.414 --> 00:52:25.142
You don't have to
answer that phone.

1180
00:52:25.176 --> 00:52:27.661
You can walk away. you
can walk away right now.

1181
00:52:27.696 --> 00:52:28.524
- Hello?

1182
00:52:29.939 --> 00:52:31.251
Yes. yes. it is.

1183
00:52:34.668 --> 00:52:35.566
Great.

1184
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.535
Thank you.

1185
00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:40.985
- You don't have to do this.

1186
00:52:42.124 --> 00:52:43.850
We. we can hang out.

1187
00:52:43.884 --> 00:52:44.816
Catch a Cubs game.

1188
00:52:47.267 --> 00:52:48.130
Pete.

1189
00:52:48.165 --> 00:52:49.131
Peter!

1190
00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:49.994
Please.

1191
00:52:57.795 --> 00:53:00.694
- Thank you for everything Gid.

1192
00:53:00.729 --> 00:53:02.765
This was fun.

1193
00:53:05.803 --> 00:53:08.323
And. I know you wanted to help.

1194
00:53:14.363 --> 00:53:15.192
And...

1195
00:53:21.439 --> 00:53:24.718
I hope that no one rolls a
cigarette out of you again.

1196
00:53:29.689 --> 00:53:30.483
- Peter!

1197
00:53:30.517 --> 00:53:31.346
Peter!

1198
00:53:34.452 --> 00:53:36.040
Uh. uh.

1199
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:39.733
Uh. okay. okay.

1200
00:53:39.768 --> 00:53:41.425
Um God.

1201
00:53:42.495 --> 00:53:44.048
Um God.

1202
00:53:44.082 --> 00:53:45.394
Um God.

1203
00:53:45.429 --> 00:53:46.257
Look.

1204
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:48.397
Peter. I mean.

1205
00:53:49.605 --> 00:53:51.469
Peter. you know Peter
he's the one with the-

1206
00:53:52.608 --> 00:53:53.540
Oh

1207
00:53:53.575 --> 00:53:54.403
Oh

1208
00:53:55.784 --> 00:53:56.785
Come on Gid.

1209
00:53:58.407 --> 00:53:59.270
Peter.

1210
00:53:59.305 --> 00:54:00.167
He uh.

1211
00:54:01.134 --> 00:54:02.963
I mean.

1212
00:54:02.998 --> 00:54:06.173
He's about to do
something pretty bad.

1213
00:54:08.417 --> 00:54:10.350
And I know you let
people. but um.

1214
00:54:13.974 --> 00:54:15.459
Be with him.

1215
00:54:15.493 --> 00:54:16.598
Please.

1216
00:54:20.429 --> 00:54:21.396
He needs you.

1217
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:22.259
- Pete?

1218
00:54:25.917 --> 00:54:26.746
Peter?

1219
00:54:28.782 --> 00:54:29.611
You okay?

1220
00:54:32.234 --> 00:54:34.063
- Please. be with him.

1221
00:54:36.928 --> 00:54:38.827
Just be with them both.

1222
00:54:41.692 --> 00:54:43.141
He needs you.

1223
00:54:43.176 --> 00:54:44.004
- Pete.

1224
00:54:45.627 --> 00:54:47.629
He needs you.

1225
00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:50.079
He needs you.

1226
00:54:54.601 --> 00:54:55.395
He needs you.

1227
00:55:43.616 --> 00:55:45.272
Thank you
so much for the help.

1228
00:55:45.307 --> 00:55:47.689
I'm sorry. that's quite heavy.

1229
00:55:47.723 --> 00:55:49.069
Yeah. yeah.

1230
00:55:49.104 --> 00:55:50.726
I've got it from here.

1231
00:55:50.761 --> 00:55:51.934
Thanks.
