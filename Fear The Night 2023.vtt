3
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.723
- Oh. shit.

4
00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:24.334
Beth. you scared me.

5
00:03:24.334 --> 00:03:27.119
I told you
not to come up here alone.

6
00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:29.513
Why? I knew
what I was looking for.

7
00:03:29.513 --> 00:03:30.993
I was just trying to
save you some time.

8
00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:33.343
I know. I just--
it's-- this is...

9
00:03:33.343 --> 00:03:35.215
What?

10
00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.785
It's my home. okay?
My things...

11
00:03:40.785 --> 00:03:43.310
Well. these aren't.
These are all of ours.

12
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.487
Fine. but
it's just [scoffs]...

13
00:03:46.487 --> 00:03:48.228
It's not that safe up here.

14
00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.404
I know what I'm doing.
you don't so...

15
00:03:52.144 --> 00:03:53.581
Oh. my god.

16
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:56.671
I'm-- I'm not-- I'm not here
for your wine collection.

17
00:03:56.671 --> 00:03:59.717
I... I came to look
at the trunk.

18
00:03:59.717 --> 00:04:00.675
get the things.

19
00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:02.720
I was closing it
and you came up.

20
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.678
Yeah.

21
00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.029
What is your point. Beth?

22
00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:09.074
Because you always have one.

23
00:04:09.074 --> 00:04:11.903
Just that...
it's my house.

24
00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:13.949
You should let me do it.
I know where things are.

25
00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:19.171
Okay. Shit.

26
00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:20.434
Whatever.

27
00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:22.305
And can you not swear
around my daughter?

28
00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:23.437
Please.

29
00:04:25.395 --> 00:04:27.484
She's not even here.

30
00:04:27.484 --> 00:04:29.138
She's not even in the house.

31
00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:29.921
Didn't Trent take her to his
parents' house for the weekend?

32
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:31.532
Yes. I know. but you do.

33
00:04:31.532 --> 00:04:33.490
I mean. you have in the past

34
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.145
so I'm just saying.
in general.

35
00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:37.407
please refrain.

36
00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:41.455
Yes.

37
00:04:42.804 --> 00:04:43.805
Yes.

38
00:04:48.462 --> 00:04:49.593
Are you coming?

39
00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:53.467
Yeah. just want to
straighten this out.

40
00:04:53.467 --> 00:04:55.599
Straighten what out?

41
00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.949
Just... the mess
you made.

42
00:04:59.429 --> 00:05:01.605
Oh. for fuck--

43
00:05:02.693 --> 00:05:05.783
Cool. You do that.
I'm gonna go get the...

44
00:05:25.977 --> 00:05:27.022
It can be a body thing
and a face thing.

45
00:05:27.022 --> 00:05:28.763
-  But also...
-  Yeah.

46
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:32.462
Yeah. like the face thing
is [indistinct].

47
00:05:32.462 --> 00:05:34.856
Yeah. I've
heard about that.

48
00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:39.904
That's actually
a good name.

49
00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:40.862
Hi.

50
00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:47.782
Hi there. guys.
How you doing?

51
00:05:47.782 --> 00:05:52.003
We're good. Tess.
How've you been?

52
00:05:52.003 --> 00:05:54.702
Good. Everything's great.

53
00:05:54.702 --> 00:05:57.531
Yeah. Beth said. uh.
what chip did you get?

54
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:59.837
How many months was it?
Was it six or nine?

55
00:05:59.837 --> 00:06:00.795
Six?

56
00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:07.541
What? It's...
it's a good thing. right?

57
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:09.020
I'm sorry.
Was it a secret?

58
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.371
No. it's not a secret.

59
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.417
No. it's a good thing.

60
00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:16.811
And yes. it's been six months.

61
00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:19.509
She's teaching
a defense class...

62
00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:22.164
in Hollywood at the Y.

63
00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:24.384
Isn't that awesome?

64
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.429
I'm not teaching
in Hollywood at all

65
00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:28.518
or at the Y.

66
00:06:28.518 --> 00:06:31.347
But I am teaching
at Baldwin Hills.

67
00:06:31.347 --> 00:06:33.697
It's an elementary school.
It's fun.

68
00:06:33.697 --> 00:06:35.612
I'm like Mister Miyagi
with tits.

69
00:06:41.052 --> 00:06:44.099
What's not landing for you?
Miyagi or tits?

70
00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:48.408
One's from <i>The Karate Kid</i>
and the other one's...

71
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:49.409
you know.

72
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.846
You got 'em. you know.

73
00:06:51.846 --> 00:06:53.587
Uh. well.
we're gonna go freshen up

74
00:06:53.587 --> 00:06:55.458
before we hit the road.
if that's all right?

75
00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:56.981
- Yeah. of course.
-  Cool.

76
00:07:03.248 --> 00:07:04.598
We'll leave soon.

77
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.866
You invited them here
to the house?

78
00:07:11.866 --> 00:07:13.258
Yeah.

79
00:07:13.258 --> 00:07:14.390
I thought we said
we were going to drive together.

80
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.001
Alone.
- We-- we can.

81
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:18.873
I just said
they could go with us

82
00:07:18.873 --> 00:07:21.179
in one car to make it easy.
but if that's not okay.

83
00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:22.616
we can just--
- God...

84
00:07:24.008 --> 00:07:25.619
What?

85
00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:28.360
Nothing. You just never do
what you say. that's all.

86
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.929
Oh. please...
look who's talking.

87
00:07:31.929 --> 00:07:33.670
The flakiest flake
in fucking Flake Town.

88
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.237
Oh. oh. Beth.
We can't swear.

89
00:07:35.237 --> 00:07:36.456
There's children.

90
00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:40.547
The farm
is in the middle of nowhere.

91
00:07:40.547 --> 00:07:42.200
- Really?
- Yeah. it is.

92
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.854
Okay?
- Hm.

93
00:07:43.854 --> 00:07:45.508
I don't even know why Rose
wanted to go there

94
00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:46.944
but she did.

95
00:07:46.944 --> 00:07:49.556
So I said. "Great. Okay. fine"
and made it happen.

96
00:07:49.556 --> 00:07:51.949
but it's not exactly
some fun little getaway.

97
00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:53.298
Can we not fight

98
00:07:53.298 --> 00:07:57.041
about every single thing. please?

99
00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:58.521
Sure.

100
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:00.131
I mean. who cares?
It's-- it's just a--

101
00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:03.308
I care.
I don't like them.

102
00:08:03.308 --> 00:08:04.788
You don't like anybody.

103
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.618
You hate my friends
and Rose's friends.

104
00:08:08.618 --> 00:08:11.012
You don't have any friends
of your own. so no luck there.

105
00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:14.102
Who is it that you actually
do like. Tess?

106
00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:16.452
Remind me.

107
00:08:16.452 --> 00:08:17.714
I don't know.
I think I used to like you.

108
00:08:17.714 --> 00:08:20.500
but that was a long time ago.

109
00:08:24.112 --> 00:08:27.071
You can be
such a bitch sometimes.

110
00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:28.072
Thanks.

111
00:08:30.074 --> 00:08:31.554
Right. who's driving.
you or me?

112
00:08:37.038 --> 00:08:39.519
Just remember.
it's not a race. all right?

113
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.782
Please don't lose them
the first chance you get.

114
00:08:41.782 --> 00:08:43.697
Oh. them?
No. I promise.

115
00:09:02.846 --> 00:09:04.631
That is bullshit.
He's crazy.

116
00:09:04.631 --> 00:09:06.894
I never said that
I would do that.

117
00:09:06.894 --> 00:09:10.941
No. I didn't.
No. I did not.

118
00:09:10.941 --> 00:09:12.856
Okay. maybe I did.
But not with him.

119
00:09:12.856 --> 00:09:14.815
Do we want vodka. too
or...?

120
00:09:14.815 --> 00:09:16.556
Yeah. Duh.
I mean. it's a party.

121
00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.296
Somebody's gonna want vodka.

122
00:09:18.296 --> 00:09:19.602
What? No. not you.

123
00:09:19.602 --> 00:09:21.604
I'm talking to Esther.
My best friend Esther.

124
00:09:21.604 --> 00:09:23.127
Who is that?

125
00:09:23.127 --> 00:09:24.172
Can I just finish?

126
00:09:25.826 --> 00:09:27.871
No. no. no.
that's Jasmine.

127
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:30.613
My other best friend.
No. this is Esther.

128
00:09:30.613 --> 00:09:31.788
No. you haven't met her.

129
00:09:31.788 --> 00:09:33.747
It's-- seriously.
it doesn't matter.

130
00:09:35.618 --> 00:09:37.707
Sebastian.
can I just please...

131
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.016
Hi. Oh. my gosh.
You guys look so great.

132
00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:44.845
Yay. What's up?

133
00:09:44.845 --> 00:09:46.586
Nothing.
Just getting supplies.

134
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.152
Just like you. Whoo.

135
00:09:48.152 --> 00:09:50.459
It's wine o'clock somewhere.
am I right?

136
00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:51.982
Come on!
It's a party.

137
00:09:51.982 --> 00:09:53.636
Is it though?

138
00:09:53.636 --> 00:09:55.116
Have you seen where we're going?
It's in the middle of nowhere

139
00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:57.248
and it's-- no offense.
but it's a kind of a dump.

140
00:09:57.248 --> 00:09:59.424
No. it's old.

141
00:09:59.424 --> 00:10:01.775
It's charming.

142
00:10:01.775 --> 00:10:04.255
Rose and I used to go there
as kids like all the time.

143
00:10:04.255 --> 00:10:05.561
Almost every summer.

144
00:10:05.561 --> 00:10:06.997
Yeah. but who has her
bridal-whatever-thingy

145
00:10:06.997 --> 00:10:09.913
at a farm in the desert?
I mean. come on.

146
00:10:09.913 --> 00:10:12.568
Excuse me. It's not
a bridal-whatever-thingy.

147
00:10:12.568 --> 00:10:14.265
It's a bachelorette party.

148
00:10:14.265 --> 00:10:15.615
There's a huge difference.

149
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.660
Yeah. Duh.
What's the difference?

150
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.271
Ummm. no grandmas
or little kids and shit.

151
00:10:20.271 --> 00:10:21.621
Okay. this is what Rose wants.

152
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.667
Just us having fun
and getting wasted.

153
00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:26.974
-  Yeah.
-  Yes. yes.

154
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.760
Sorry.

155
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.762
Cleanup on aisle four.

156
00:10:32.762 --> 00:10:34.590
I see Mia hasn't
changed much.

157
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.810
Yeah. pretty much.

158
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.159
But she'll be fine.

159
00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:40.030
I mean. she's better
when she's a little drunk.

160
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.857
Or high.

161
00:10:40.857 --> 00:10:41.989
Or just been fucked.

162
00:10:43.904 --> 00:10:45.645
What? I never fucked her.

163
00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:46.602
Uhhh...

164
00:10:46.602 --> 00:10:48.735
What? I didn't.

165
00:10:48.735 --> 00:10:51.346
I mean. not since school.

166
00:10:51.346 --> 00:10:53.130
- I knew it. I knew it.
- What?

167
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.871
I knew it.

168
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:56.960
Ladies. snacks?
Esther. come on.

169
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.353
[chuckling] On chips.

170
00:10:58.353 --> 00:11:00.703
- Whoa!

171
00:11:00.703 --> 00:11:02.749
What's gonna go
with mac and cheese?

172
00:11:02.749 --> 00:11:05.316
Hey. cutie.

173
00:11:05.316 --> 00:11:06.709
Need some help with that?

174
00:11:06.709 --> 00:11:08.668
Yeah. you know.
if you want a ride.

175
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.408
our truck's right outside.

176
00:11:10.408 --> 00:11:11.801
Come for a ride.

177
00:11:11.801 --> 00:11:13.760
You know. thanks.
We're good.

178
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.022
What about you. sweetheart?

179
00:11:16.197 --> 00:11:19.374
You looking for
something special?

180
00:11:19.374 --> 00:11:21.463
No. I'm-- I'm good.

181
00:11:21.463 --> 00:11:22.638
I don't think we got

182
00:11:22.638 --> 00:11:24.335
one of them international
aisles here. so.

183
00:11:26.033 --> 00:11:28.731
Oh. and then there were three.

184
00:11:35.869 --> 00:11:37.740
You boys just taking
a break from getting shit-faced

185
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.917
or are you excited to look at
someone other than your sister?

186
00:11:43.093 --> 00:11:44.355
Well. there's no harm
in looking now.

187
00:11:44.355 --> 00:11:46.880
is there. sweetheart? Hm?

188
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.533
Depends. I guess.

189
00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:50.492
Yeah. well.
we're not looking at you.

190
00:11:50.492 --> 00:11:52.363
So why don't you move on?

191
00:11:52.363 --> 00:11:53.364
For sure.

192
00:11:55.192 --> 00:11:56.280
Hey. you should take
that cap off

193
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.239
if you didn't serve.

194
00:11:58.239 --> 00:11:59.719
And I know you didn't.

195
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:00.981
I did.

196
00:12:03.548 --> 00:12:06.116
I served.
I gave it to him.

197
00:12:06.116 --> 00:12:09.729
No way.
Where'd you serve?

198
00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:12.253
Ramstein.
86th Airlift Wing.

199
00:12:12.253 --> 00:12:15.778
Oh. I thought you said
you "“served."”

200
00:12:15.778 --> 00:12:17.084
My mistake.

201
00:12:17.084 --> 00:12:18.259
Fuck you.

202
00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:20.435
I bet you don't even know
where that is.

203
00:12:20.435 --> 00:12:21.828
Not exactly. but I--

204
00:12:21.828 --> 00:12:23.960
I think it's in
southwestern Germany. right?

205
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.745
About 15 clicks east of K-Town

206
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.834
and three clicks
west of Landstuhl?

207
00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:33.796
Oh. I know why
you look familiar now.

208
00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:35.537
Are you one of the guys
who changed my bedpan

209
00:12:35.537 --> 00:12:38.235
when I got medevacked there?

210
00:12:38.235 --> 00:12:40.237
I almost missed it.

211
00:12:40.237 --> 00:12:41.238
Bullshit.

212
00:12:41.238 --> 00:12:42.413
Bullshit?

213
00:12:42.413 --> 00:12:43.980
I was an MP.
for your info. all right?

214
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.026
That's Military Police.

215
00:12:46.026 --> 00:12:46.983
Wow.

216
00:12:46.983 --> 00:12:49.072
Where you medevacked from?

217
00:12:49.072 --> 00:12:50.204
Fallujah.

218
00:12:51.466 --> 00:12:53.947
That's. uh. that's in Iraq.
for you boys.

219
00:12:55.687 --> 00:12:58.429
Nah. No fucking way.
you're too young.

220
00:12:58.429 --> 00:13:00.954
No. Third battle. 2016.

221
00:13:02.738 --> 00:13:05.610
No. because we didn't
have any troops in that. bitch.

222
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.787
No. we had advisors
from 2014 on.

223
00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.093
Who do you think was
protecting them. asshole?

224
00:13:10.093 --> 00:13:12.356
People like me.
who were in the actual shit.

225
00:13:12.356 --> 00:13:14.576
Not people like you. who were
skipping around Europe

226
00:13:14.576 --> 00:13:16.099
enjoying Oktoberfest.

227
00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:18.754
You better watch
your fucking mouth.

228
00:13:18.754 --> 00:13:19.799
You're probably right.

229
00:13:20.843 --> 00:13:22.932
You think
you're tough. huh?

230
00:13:22.932 --> 00:13:24.891
I mean.
I'm tough enough. I guess.

231
00:13:24.891 --> 00:13:26.936
Yeah. Why don't we
find out how tough?

232
00:13:28.242 --> 00:13:29.373
Tess?

233
00:13:31.985 --> 00:13:33.247
You know.
I would love to.

234
00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:35.510
I just... I gotta
get to a party.

235
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.904
So maybe another time.

236
00:13:52.135 --> 00:13:53.397
We'll see you there.

237
00:13:53.397 --> 00:13:56.139
Okay. great.

238
00:13:56.139 --> 00:13:57.749
I'm surprised
they even had wine.

239
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.981
Hey. do we even know
who the caretakers are anymore?

240
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.199
I don't.

241
00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:25.375
Me either. but I called
and left a message

242
00:16:25.375 --> 00:16:27.203
like we're supposed to
when we use the house.

243
00:16:27.203 --> 00:16:28.639
I thought
it was an older couple.

244
00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:29.814
A man and a woman.

245
00:16:29.814 --> 00:16:33.557
No. that was... is it?

246
00:16:33.557 --> 00:16:35.298
Dad keeps losing people
so I'm not even sure.

247
00:16:35.298 --> 00:16:36.517
I think these guys have been

248
00:16:36.517 --> 00:16:38.345
here for a while now.

249
00:16:43.741 --> 00:16:45.613
I'll walk down later
and introduce myself.

250
00:16:45.613 --> 00:16:46.962
Or I can.

251
00:16:46.962 --> 00:16:48.920
I know you want to get
started with the party.

252
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.052
Either way.

253
00:16:52.533 --> 00:16:55.362
Maybe better if it's me since
I'm the one who contacted them

254
00:16:55.362 --> 00:16:57.146
for the party and everything.

255
00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:05.372
Uh-uh.

256
00:17:09.071 --> 00:17:13.075
I love it here.
Great vibes.

257
00:17:13.075 --> 00:17:14.598
I told you so.

258
00:17:14.598 --> 00:17:15.643
Yes. you did.

259
00:17:19.603 --> 00:17:20.909
Look at that.

260
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:22.084
I'm looking.

261
00:17:23.781 --> 00:17:25.348
I bet you are.

262
00:17:49.111 --> 00:17:50.243
Mm-hm.

263
00:17:57.511 --> 00:17:59.078
Or you don't have to
wear a push-up bra.

264
00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.297
That's why
I got [indistinct].

265
00:18:01.297 --> 00:18:02.733
There's only 150
since [indistinct].

266
00:18:13.266 --> 00:18:14.223
- Oh.
- Come on. bitch.

267
00:18:14.223 --> 00:18:16.138
Let's have some fun.

268
00:18:16.138 --> 00:18:17.444
Oh. this is me having fun.

269
00:18:17.444 --> 00:18:18.271
Oh.

270
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:20.403
Sorry.

271
00:18:20.403 --> 00:18:24.103
I'm just daydreaming
for whatever reason.

272
00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.453
Oh. it's okay.

273
00:18:26.453 --> 00:18:28.846
Hey. it's...
it's really good to see you.

274
00:18:28.846 --> 00:18:31.327
You too.

275
00:18:31.327 --> 00:18:34.809
Okay. who wants me
to do a reading?

276
00:18:34.809 --> 00:18:35.897
Oh. me!

277
00:18:35.897 --> 00:18:36.985
Aahh.

278
00:18:36.985 --> 00:18:38.291
Come on.
Let's pull a card.

279
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.259
No.

280
00:18:50.259 --> 00:18:51.304
No. thank you.

281
00:18:51.304 --> 00:18:52.566
Sorry. no. thank you.

282
00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:56.787
Hey. Tessie.
Who's your favorite sister?

283
00:18:56.787 --> 00:18:59.181
Come on. say it.

284
00:18:59.181 --> 00:19:01.096
Hey.
- You are.

285
00:19:02.184 --> 00:19:03.185
Hey. middle sis.

286
00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:04.186
Hi. little sis.

287
00:19:04.186 --> 00:19:05.753
Thanks for coming.

288
00:19:05.753 --> 00:19:09.017
I know this isn't your kind of
thing. so thank you.

289
00:19:09.017 --> 00:19:11.193
Honestly.

290
00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:12.803
Of course.

291
00:19:12.803 --> 00:19:14.283
Hey. Tess.

292
00:19:14.283 --> 00:19:16.677
You still out there making
America great again?

293
00:19:16.677 --> 00:19:18.244
Maybe.

294
00:19:18.244 --> 00:19:20.550
You still out there letting
third graders do your hair?

295
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.987
Braids are very in
right now.

296
00:19:22.987 --> 00:19:24.119
I mean...

297
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:25.729
I like these.

298
00:19:25.729 --> 00:19:26.948
Bitch.

299
00:19:26.948 --> 00:19:27.949
How's life?

300
00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:28.993
All good.

301
00:19:28.993 --> 00:19:31.300
Working. partying.

302
00:19:34.912 --> 00:19:36.827
This is gonna be fun. right?

303
00:19:36.827 --> 00:19:39.090
Oh. yeah.
Yes. of course.

304
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:40.135
- Okay.
- Look at you.

305
00:19:40.135 --> 00:19:42.137
- Bride-to-be.

306
00:19:42.137 --> 00:19:43.269
Could you be cuter?

307
00:19:43.269 --> 00:19:44.357
Look at your body.

308
00:19:44.357 --> 00:19:47.577
Ugh. no. Look at you!

309
00:19:47.577 --> 00:19:49.405
You're fit as shit.
Seriously. Tess.

310
00:19:49.405 --> 00:19:50.406
- Well. yeah.
- What the hell?

311
00:19:50.406 --> 00:19:52.060
One addiction for another.

312
00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.844
Come here.
you fucking cutie.

313
00:19:53.844 --> 00:19:56.891
-  Beth!
-  You fucking cutie!

314
00:19:58.545 --> 00:20:01.156
Hello!

315
00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:10.443
Hello?

316
00:22:07.587 --> 00:22:11.068
No. Seriously. let's get it
done tonight.

317
00:22:11.068 --> 00:22:12.243
It's what we said we'd do.

318
00:22:12.243 --> 00:22:14.333
It makes me nervous
if we don't...

319
00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:15.856
got too many guys
we've been using lately.

320
00:22:15.856 --> 00:22:17.336
too many big mouths.

321
00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:19.816
plus. we got those new people
moving in come Monday.

322
00:22:19.816 --> 00:22:22.253
Let's get it out of there
tonight or move it at least.

323
00:22:22.253 --> 00:22:23.385
Fine.

324
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:25.779
Shit. I gotta
run back into town.

325
00:22:25.779 --> 00:22:28.347
grab some trash bags.
You wanna come with?

326
00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:30.131
Uh. yeah.
Start the truck.

327
00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:31.828
I gotta take a piss.

328
00:22:31.828 --> 00:22:32.829
All right.

329
00:22:42.448 --> 00:22:43.666
Who's this?

330
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.017
Oh. [chuckles] Yes.

331
00:22:47.017 --> 00:22:48.018
Sorry about that.

332
00:22:48.018 --> 00:22:50.238
Yeah. Hello?

333
00:22:50.238 --> 00:22:52.545
Hello?

334
00:22:52.545 --> 00:22:54.547
Yeah. I hear you.

335
00:22:54.547 --> 00:22:56.810
Sorry. the reception
is bad here.

336
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.334
No. we got your message
about you and the party.

337
00:22:59.334 --> 00:23:02.119
Is everything okay?
That's great.

338
00:23:04.295 --> 00:23:06.602
Your sister? No.

339
00:23:06.602 --> 00:23:09.431
Nobody has been
down here today.

340
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:10.954
Not that I know of.

341
00:23:13.087 --> 00:23:15.698
Uh. if I see her. I will.

342
00:23:15.698 --> 00:23:17.526
I'm just heading into town.

343
00:23:17.526 --> 00:23:20.094
You-- you ladies need anything?

344
00:23:20.094 --> 00:23:21.225
No?

345
00:23:21.225 --> 00:23:23.227
All right. have fun.

346
00:23:23.227 --> 00:23:25.447
You too.

347
00:23:25.447 --> 00:23:26.927
Take care.

348
00:23:28.145 --> 00:23:29.886
"Take care."
Shut the fuck up.

349
00:24:28.597 --> 00:24:29.642
All right.

350
00:24:29.642 --> 00:24:30.860
Oh. my god.

351
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.907
Have you given
a hand job to someone

352
00:24:33.907 --> 00:24:36.039
who you were not
very attracted to?

353
00:24:36.039 --> 00:24:38.041
Why would I? No.

354
00:24:44.657 --> 00:24:46.528
Who are you?

355
00:24:46.528 --> 00:24:48.138
I'm sorry?

356
00:24:48.138 --> 00:24:50.140
Who are you?

357
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.533
I'm the chef...

358
00:24:51.533 --> 00:24:52.839
for tonight.

359
00:24:52.839 --> 00:24:53.840
A chef?

360
00:24:56.886 --> 00:24:58.235
Yeah. Okay.

361
00:24:59.715 --> 00:25:00.890
That's fine. I guess.

362
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.065
You guess?

363
00:25:02.979 --> 00:25:04.503
You are a funny one.

364
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:07.288
You have no idea.

365
00:25:09.899 --> 00:25:10.726
Tess.

366
00:25:10.726 --> 00:25:12.162
- Hey.

367
00:25:12.162 --> 00:25:13.163
Where you been?

368
00:25:14.425 --> 00:25:18.038
In here. giving me
the third degree.

369
00:25:18.038 --> 00:25:19.169
That's not true.

370
00:25:19.169 --> 00:25:21.345
I was asking him who he was.

371
00:25:21.345 --> 00:25:23.391
I didn't see him
when I went outside

372
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:26.089
and then I come in and there's
these knives everywhere and...

373
00:25:26.089 --> 00:25:27.700
yeah.

374
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.397
Can I talk to you
for a second?

375
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.968
Please.

376
00:25:36.099 --> 00:25:37.840
Okay. I'm on my way.

377
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.929
I'll just prepare in here.

378
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.021
Shot!

379
00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:46.153
Oh. my god.

380
00:25:52.638 --> 00:25:54.901
What. um. [clears throat].

381
00:25:54.901 --> 00:25:56.337
What-- what do you think
you're doing?

382
00:25:57.643 --> 00:25:58.774
What does that mean?

383
00:26:00.602 --> 00:26:03.866
I come into the kitchen
to check on the chef.

384
00:26:03.866 --> 00:26:07.783
and of course. I find you in
here in conflict with him.

385
00:26:07.783 --> 00:26:09.219
like with every other man

386
00:26:09.219 --> 00:26:12.048
walking the face of
the fucking planet.

387
00:26:12.048 --> 00:26:13.223
And because why?

388
00:26:13.223 --> 00:26:14.790
I'm sorry. I...

389
00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.096
I came in here and--

390
00:26:16.096 --> 00:26:20.404
and I didn't know
who he was and so I asked.

391
00:26:20.404 --> 00:26:21.580
That's it.

392
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.277
He wasn't here when I left.
all right?

393
00:26:23.277 --> 00:26:24.539
Right. Yeah. yeah.

394
00:26:24.539 --> 00:26:27.194
Uh. left to go where?

395
00:26:27.194 --> 00:26:28.543
You know where.

396
00:26:28.543 --> 00:26:30.589
I said I would
take care of it.

397
00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:32.939
But no. you had to go
down there. didn't you?

398
00:26:32.939 --> 00:26:34.070
So what?

399
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.595
Because I said
I'd take care of it.

400
00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:38.074
- And?
- And?

401
00:26:38.074 --> 00:26:39.641
And guess what?

402
00:26:39.641 --> 00:26:41.730
Everything is fine.

403
00:26:43.123 --> 00:26:45.168
No.

404
00:26:45.168 --> 00:26:48.084
There's something
strange about those guys.

405
00:26:48.084 --> 00:26:50.043
Oh. oh. really?

406
00:26:50.043 --> 00:26:53.916
Really? What's...
what's strange?

407
00:26:56.745 --> 00:26:59.530
Well. I went in.
um. and. uh--

408
00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.271
Sorry. You went--
you went in--

409
00:27:01.271 --> 00:27:03.056
in their house?

410
00:27:03.056 --> 00:27:04.579
Not their house.

411
00:27:04.579 --> 00:27:05.928
It's our house.
Our property.

412
00:27:05.928 --> 00:27:06.799
Still.

413
00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:08.452
But I'm sorry. I had to.

414
00:27:08.452 --> 00:27:09.671
They're suspicious.

415
00:27:11.499 --> 00:27:12.674
Says who?

416
00:27:12.674 --> 00:27:13.675
- Says me.
-  Okay.

417
00:27:13.675 --> 00:27:15.111
So. um. I called home

418
00:27:15.111 --> 00:27:17.113
and they're the guys
who were hired last year

419
00:27:17.113 --> 00:27:19.333
to help with the handover
of the property. okay?

420
00:27:19.333 --> 00:27:20.769
So [inhales] not murderers.

421
00:27:20.769 --> 00:27:23.467
- Wait. you spoke to Dad?
- Mm-hm.

422
00:27:23.467 --> 00:27:24.860
How did you call him?

423
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:25.861
There's no landline here.

424
00:27:25.861 --> 00:27:27.167
It isn't working.
I checked.

425
00:27:27.167 --> 00:27:29.691
You are fucking insane.
do you know that?

426
00:27:29.691 --> 00:27:31.519
I leaned out the window
in the upper bedroom

427
00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:33.826
like we always used to do.

428
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.871
Right.

429
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.788
Listen to me.

430
00:27:39.788 --> 00:27:41.660
Just listen.
Please listen to me.

431
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.009
Seriously.

432
00:27:44.227 --> 00:27:47.709
Your sister. our sister.

433
00:27:47.709 --> 00:27:49.668
is trying to have her
bachelorette party

434
00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:52.845
and this is what you want to do?

435
00:27:52.845 --> 00:27:56.631
Try and-- try and scare people?

436
00:27:56.631 --> 00:27:58.764
I'm sorry.

437
00:27:58.764 --> 00:28:01.244
But maybe
you should relax and...

438
00:28:01.244 --> 00:28:04.247
have a drink.

439
00:28:04.247 --> 00:28:05.640
Maybe that'd help.

440
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.163
I'm sorry. what?

441
00:28:07.163 --> 00:28:08.121
You heard me.

442
00:28:10.514 --> 00:28:11.690
A little bit of alcohol.

443
00:28:13.822 --> 00:28:15.955
That's a real shit thing
to say to me. you know that?

444
00:28:15.955 --> 00:28:17.391
Just. uh...

445
00:28:17.391 --> 00:28:18.740
just call 'em like I see 'em.

446
00:28:24.224 --> 00:28:27.227
Thanks for dressing up.
by the way.

447
00:28:27.227 --> 00:28:28.315
It's really nice.

448
00:28:35.452 --> 00:28:36.845
There she is!

449
00:28:42.068 --> 00:28:43.156
Okay. okay. okay.

450
00:28:43.156 --> 00:28:47.377
Have you joined
the Mile High Club?

451
00:28:47.377 --> 00:28:48.509
Oh. she has.

452
00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:50.903
Oh. my gosh.

453
00:28:50.903 --> 00:28:53.209
Oh. my gosh. Okay.

454
00:28:53.209 --> 00:28:57.648
Have you ever had sex
on a carnival ride?

455
00:28:59.781 --> 00:29:01.696
Oh. my gosh.

456
00:29:01.696 --> 00:29:03.045
Duh.

457
00:29:04.917 --> 00:29:08.094
Have you hooked up
with an unattractive rich guy?

458
00:29:08.094 --> 00:29:09.922
Um. yes!

459
00:29:40.822 --> 00:29:41.954
Fuck it.

460
00:29:47.829 --> 00:29:50.614
Yeah. not today.

461
00:29:50.614 --> 00:29:51.877
Not today.

462
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:54.444
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

463
00:29:54.444 --> 00:29:56.795
Shot! Shot!

464
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.115
Ladies.

465
00:30:13.115 --> 00:30:14.725
-  Oohh!

466
00:30:14.725 --> 00:30:19.165
Hello. hello. hello.
My name is Alfonse

467
00:30:19.165 --> 00:30:20.470
and I've got some
treats for you ladies

468
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:21.732
to get you guys started.

469
00:30:21.732 --> 00:30:22.821
Oh. my god.

470
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:23.778
They're tiny little
dicks!

471
00:30:23.778 --> 00:30:24.779
Yes. they are.

472
00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:26.302
Yes. they are dicks.

473
00:30:26.302 --> 00:30:27.303
Yes. they are.

474
00:30:27.303 --> 00:30:28.391
Thank you.

475
00:30:28.391 --> 00:30:29.436
I think you should have
two dicks.

476
00:30:29.436 --> 00:30:30.350
I'll have two dicks in
my mouth.

477
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.004
Two dicks in her mouth.

478
00:30:32.004 --> 00:30:34.833
Now. I'm not sure how much you
ladies know about this evening

479
00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:36.660
but we are going to
have a great time.

480
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.966
I promise you that.

481
00:30:37.966 --> 00:30:39.794
I've got some beautiful
sea bass croquettes

482
00:30:39.794 --> 00:30:41.230
along with a few other treats

483
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:42.884
and that's not even
talking about dessert.

484
00:30:42.884 --> 00:30:44.712
You know what I mean?
- I hope you're dessert.

485
00:30:44.712 --> 00:30:47.193
Oh my. my. my.

486
00:30:47.193 --> 00:30:49.325
Aren't you the
naughty little girl?

487
00:30:49.325 --> 00:30:50.500
Fuck yes. I am!

488
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.982
- Yeah. she is.

489
00:30:53.982 --> 00:30:57.986
As luck would have it.
I'm a naughty little boy.

490
00:30:57.986 --> 00:31:00.684
So things might get a little interesting.

491
00:31:05.907 --> 00:31:07.213
Oh. my god!

492
00:31:08.954 --> 00:31:10.172
Whoa!

493
00:31:55.043 --> 00:31:57.567
- Hey. middle sis.
- Hey.

494
00:31:57.567 --> 00:31:59.352
My baby girl.

495
00:32:00.396 --> 00:32:01.920
What's going on?

496
00:32:03.443 --> 00:32:04.574
Hey. I'm sorry.

497
00:32:04.574 --> 00:32:06.054
I'm not trying to
ruin anything for you.

498
00:32:06.054 --> 00:32:09.666
- Oh. no. no. It's fine.
- I just need a little space.

499
00:32:09.666 --> 00:32:12.756
You're just missing
the stripper. that's all.

500
00:32:12.756 --> 00:32:14.758
The what?

501
00:32:14.758 --> 00:32:16.412
The stripper.

502
00:32:17.413 --> 00:32:18.762
Oh shit.

503
00:32:18.762 --> 00:32:20.460
The caterer guy? Oh. god.

504
00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.766
Exactly.

505
00:32:22.766 --> 00:32:24.116
He is also the entertainment.

506
00:32:24.116 --> 00:32:25.769
So gross.

507
00:32:25.769 --> 00:32:28.511
Yeah.

508
00:32:28.511 --> 00:32:29.948
I was very happy to
get out of there

509
00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:31.993
and let the others take a turn.

510
00:32:31.993 --> 00:32:34.039
Good girl.

511
00:32:37.259 --> 00:32:38.521
So...

512
00:32:39.653 --> 00:32:42.090
what's happening out here?

513
00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:44.527
Nothing. I just...

514
00:32:44.527 --> 00:32:48.618
just feels weird being back
here. that's all.

515
00:32:48.618 --> 00:32:49.880
You sure?

516
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.056
Yeah. why?

517
00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:55.451
Do you want to talk
about it?

518
00:32:55.451 --> 00:32:56.452
No.

519
00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.498
It's your night.

520
00:33:02.589 --> 00:33:04.634
Oh. boy.
- Rose. I'm sorry about this.

521
00:33:06.027 --> 00:33:10.727
Sorry. Rose.

522
00:33:10.727 --> 00:33:12.991
that I even let you invite her.

523
00:33:17.082 --> 00:33:18.561
It's cold out.

524
00:33:18.561 --> 00:33:19.693
Come back inside.

525
00:33:19.693 --> 00:33:20.650
You don't have to comfort her.

526
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:22.696
It's not your job.

527
00:33:22.696 --> 00:33:24.045
We're just talking. Beth.

528
00:33:24.045 --> 00:33:26.265
Yeah. Yeah.
like sisters do.

529
00:33:32.575 --> 00:33:36.449
Do you mind if your
fucking sister goes inside

530
00:33:36.449 --> 00:33:39.321
and enjoys the rest of
her fucking party

531
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:41.410
that I put together for her?

532
00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:44.109
Or do you want to keep making
this all about you?

533
00:33:45.893 --> 00:33:46.981
Huh?

534
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:57.557
- Open the door.

535
00:33:57.557 --> 00:33:58.906
Beth. open the door!

536
00:33:58.906 --> 00:34:00.081
Beth. go!

537
00:34:02.866 --> 00:34:04.085
What's going on?

538
00:34:04.085 --> 00:34:04.999
What's happening?
-  Oh. my god.

539
00:34:04.999 --> 00:34:06.827
Wait. what's happening?

540
00:34:06.827 --> 00:34:09.047
Beth. close the door.

541
00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:10.222
Beth.

542
00:34:13.094 --> 00:34:14.574
Oh. my god. Rose.

543
00:34:14.574 --> 00:34:15.488
Is that blood?

544
00:34:16.532 --> 00:34:18.360
Tess. what the fuck
is going on?

545
00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.362
Who the fuck is out there?

546
00:34:20.362 --> 00:34:21.885
-  Oh. my god. Rose.
- Beth.

547
00:34:21.885 --> 00:34:23.235
- Beth. Beth.

548
00:34:23.235 --> 00:34:24.888
I need you to get your phone.
Beth. look at me.

549
00:34:24.888 --> 00:34:26.412
I need you to call 911 or Dad.

550
00:34:26.412 --> 00:34:27.717
Whoever you can get a hold of. okay?

551
00:34:27.717 --> 00:34:29.284
Beth. look at me. Go now.

552
00:34:29.284 --> 00:34:30.459
I'll go. I'll go.

553
00:34:30.459 --> 00:34:31.852
I know the trick.
Out the window. right?

554
00:34:31.852 --> 00:34:32.983
Yeah. yeah.

555
00:34:32.983 --> 00:34:33.897
Rose and I
used to do that and I--

556
00:34:33.897 --> 00:34:36.552
Go. go. go. go.
Be careful.

557
00:34:36.552 --> 00:34:38.380
- Tess. what happened?
-  What is happening. Tess?

558
00:34:41.557 --> 00:34:42.384
Okay. okay. okay.

559
00:34:42.384 --> 00:34:43.907
Ladies. don't be afraid.

560
00:34:43.907 --> 00:34:46.562
This is what we are going to do.

561
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.004
Tess.
what's happening?

562
00:34:54.004 --> 00:34:54.875
What are we doing?
-  Tess!

563
00:34:54.875 --> 00:34:55.832
What the fuck!

564
00:34:55.832 --> 00:34:56.920
Shut up.

565
00:34:58.748 --> 00:35:00.098
What the fuck.

566
00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:02.622
Oh. shit. Okay.

567
00:35:06.713 --> 00:35:07.888
Oh. shit.

568
00:35:24.818 --> 00:35:25.906
Okay.

569
00:35:25.906 --> 00:35:27.299
All right.

570
00:35:27.299 --> 00:35:28.822
We got to get the rest of
these doors locked. okay?

571
00:35:28.822 --> 00:35:29.823
Pull some shit up against them.

572
00:35:29.823 --> 00:35:31.216
Make sure they're blocked.

573
00:35:31.216 --> 00:35:32.652
All these lights have to go out.

574
00:35:32.652 --> 00:35:34.436
Unplug every single thing
you see upstairs and down.

575
00:35:34.436 --> 00:35:38.571
If they get in here. it needs to
be pitch dark. okay?

576
00:35:38.571 --> 00:35:40.616
Stay low.

577
00:35:40.616 --> 00:35:42.488
You guys start in here.
I'm gonna get the kitchen.

578
00:36:26.532 --> 00:36:28.577
Esther's upstairs
trying to call out.

579
00:36:28.577 --> 00:36:30.405
But I need all of you
to do the same.

580
00:36:30.405 --> 00:36:31.798
Grab your phones.
Call the police.

581
00:36:31.798 --> 00:36:33.103
Call 911.

582
00:36:33.103 --> 00:36:34.061
Call anyone you can get
ahold of. all right?

583
00:36:34.061 --> 00:36:35.193
Do it now.

584
00:36:35.193 --> 00:36:36.237
Who is it?

585
00:36:36.237 --> 00:36:38.021
Why are they doing this?

586
00:36:38.021 --> 00:36:39.371
I don't know.
Not yet.

587
00:36:39.371 --> 00:36:40.850
I-- I-- is it
someone's boyfriend?

588
00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:41.851
O-- o-- or?

589
00:36:41.851 --> 00:36:43.026
Hey. what's going on?

590
00:36:43.026 --> 00:36:44.463
I don't know.
Stop asking me.

591
00:36:44.463 --> 00:36:46.769
I'm sorry. but they're
trying to fucking kill us.

592
00:36:46.769 --> 00:36:48.336
So that's why I'm asking.

593
00:36:48.336 --> 00:36:50.208
Screaming is not going
to keep us alive.

594
00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:51.513
Listen to me.
and maybe that will.

595
00:36:51.513 --> 00:36:53.298
Now get on your goddamn phone.

596
00:36:58.041 --> 00:36:59.869
I've got nothing.
no signal.

597
00:36:59.869 --> 00:37:00.870
It's not working.

598
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:01.871
No signal.
-  Me neither.

599
00:37:01.871 --> 00:37:03.699
Shit. shit. shit.

600
00:37:03.699 --> 00:37:05.048
All right. we need
to get prepared

601
00:37:05.048 --> 00:37:07.529
for whatever those people
are going to do next.

602
00:37:07.529 --> 00:37:09.488
In fact. you guys. we gotta
start gathering weapons.

603
00:37:09.488 --> 00:37:10.532
-  What?
- All right?

604
00:37:10.532 --> 00:37:11.751
- Weapons?
-  Yes.

605
00:37:11.751 --> 00:37:14.232
Anything that can hurt
or kill someone.

606
00:37:15.929 --> 00:37:16.930
Just anything. okay?

607
00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.279
Knives in the kitchen.

608
00:37:18.279 --> 00:37:20.063
Scissors in the drawer
or the fireplace poker.

609
00:37:20.063 --> 00:37:21.456
This is a farm.

610
00:37:21.456 --> 00:37:24.416
You don't have a gun
or something like that?

611
00:37:24.416 --> 00:37:25.939
My mom hates 'em. We don't
keep them in the house.

612
00:37:25.939 --> 00:37:27.288
What the fuck.

613
00:37:28.594 --> 00:37:30.291
My dad has a bunch of
shit in the shed

614
00:37:30.291 --> 00:37:31.336
but it's out by the orchard.

615
00:37:31.336 --> 00:37:33.076
His guns are in there too.

616
00:37:33.076 --> 00:37:34.295
But I'd have to...

617
00:37:34.295 --> 00:37:35.557
I'd have to go get it.

618
00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:40.345
First things first.

619
00:37:40.345 --> 00:37:41.607
We get ready to fight in here.

620
00:37:44.827 --> 00:37:46.264
It's okay. It's okay.

621
00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:47.308
They're just trying to scare us.

622
00:37:47.308 --> 00:37:48.396
Yeah? It's working.

623
00:37:48.396 --> 00:37:50.920
I know. but...

624
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.183
I think they're trying not to
draw attention to themselves.

625
00:37:53.183 --> 00:37:54.924
trying not to
alert the neighbors.

626
00:37:54.924 --> 00:37:57.057
That's why they're using bows
and arrows and not guns.

627
00:37:57.057 --> 00:37:58.928
It's got to be a mistake. right?

628
00:37:58.928 --> 00:38:01.757
I mean. why else would
they be doing this?

629
00:38:01.757 --> 00:38:02.715
I don't know.

630
00:38:03.977 --> 00:38:05.413
I honestly don't know.

631
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.506
Shit.

632
00:38:11.506 --> 00:38:12.812
Let me check the cars.

633
00:38:30.699 --> 00:38:31.961
We can't just
sit around doing nothing.

634
00:38:31.961 --> 00:38:34.355
Who's out there?

635
00:38:34.355 --> 00:38:36.401
I need one of you to run
upstairs and warn Esther.

636
00:38:36.401 --> 00:38:38.098
She's at the back of the house.

637
00:38:38.098 --> 00:38:39.447
She's not going to know what's
happening before it's too late.

638
00:38:39.447 --> 00:38:40.709
And what are you
going to do?

639
00:38:40.709 --> 00:38:42.145
Someone out there is
slashing our tires

640
00:38:42.145 --> 00:38:44.147
so we don't leave.

641
00:38:44.147 --> 00:38:45.453
I'm going to try and stop 'em.

642
00:38:45.453 --> 00:38:46.628
What?

643
00:38:46.628 --> 00:38:47.455
How?

644
00:38:47.455 --> 00:38:48.935
How do you think?

645
00:38:48.935 --> 00:38:51.503
Divya. I need you to open
the back door for me. okay.

646
00:38:51.503 --> 00:38:52.808
and then close it behind me.

647
00:38:52.808 --> 00:38:54.375
Lock it.

648
00:38:54.375 --> 00:38:56.682
If I make it back. I'm gonna
knock twice. and then once.

649
00:38:56.682 --> 00:38:58.379
Don't open it unless
you hear that.

650
00:38:58.379 --> 00:39:00.163
Two knocks followed by one.

651
00:39:00.163 --> 00:39:01.295
Are you fucking
kidding me?

652
00:39:01.295 --> 00:39:02.644
No. I'm not.

653
00:39:02.644 --> 00:39:04.298
Let's go.

654
00:39:04.298 --> 00:39:06.431
But if you
don't come back.

655
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:09.347
then what do we do?

656
00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:11.523
All of you
do anything to survive.

657
00:39:11.523 --> 00:39:13.002
and I mean anything.

658
00:39:13.002 --> 00:39:14.264
Tess. this is insane.

659
00:39:14.264 --> 00:39:15.396
I know.

660
00:39:17.006 --> 00:39:18.051
Let's go.

661
00:39:21.794 --> 00:39:23.578
All right. come on.

662
00:39:54.043 --> 00:39:55.349
Hey.

663
00:40:52.667 --> 00:40:54.147
What happened
out there?

664
00:40:54.147 --> 00:40:55.714
I got one of them.

665
00:40:55.714 --> 00:40:56.976
Dead.

666
00:40:56.976 --> 00:40:58.238
Mia's car is still okay.

667
00:40:58.238 --> 00:41:00.283
Look at your hands.

668
00:41:00.283 --> 00:41:01.371
It's fine.

669
00:41:01.371 --> 00:41:02.547
No. it's not.

670
00:41:02.547 --> 00:41:03.548
You're bleeding.

671
00:41:03.548 --> 00:41:05.375
No. it's not mine.

672
00:41:05.375 --> 00:41:07.029
We don't have time
to think about this.

673
00:41:07.029 --> 00:41:09.771
They're gonna come after us when
they find out what's happened.

674
00:41:09.771 --> 00:41:11.381
I didn't see anyone else
out there

675
00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:13.471
but. I know they're
wandering around

676
00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:15.124
trying to figure out
what to do next...

677
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.963
Oh. these are great.

678
00:41:27.963 --> 00:41:29.356
Thank you. guys.

679
00:41:29.356 --> 00:41:30.488
Got it.

680
00:41:33.186 --> 00:41:35.623
Each of you. you need to
grab one thing from this pile.

681
00:41:35.623 --> 00:41:37.103
Be ready to use it.

682
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:40.323
See if you recognize this guy.

683
00:41:40.323 --> 00:41:41.281
I don't.

684
00:41:43.283 --> 00:41:44.197
No.

685
00:41:46.025 --> 00:41:46.895
Take a look.

686
00:41:55.904 --> 00:41:57.602
Jackass.

687
00:41:58.733 --> 00:42:00.213
No?

688
00:42:00.213 --> 00:42:02.128
All right. I'm gonna go upstairs
to try to help Esther.

689
00:42:02.128 --> 00:42:04.043
Two of you. keep your eyes
on the kitchen.

690
00:42:07.394 --> 00:42:10.179
We're gonna get out of here but
we have to do this together.

691
00:42:10.179 --> 00:42:11.224
Okay?

692
00:42:11.224 --> 00:42:15.924
Tess. I'm scared.

693
00:42:15.924 --> 00:42:17.186
Me. too.

694
00:42:17.186 --> 00:42:18.797
I just...

695
00:42:18.797 --> 00:42:21.277
I just want to see
my little girl.

696
00:42:21.277 --> 00:42:23.192
and that's all I want. okay?

697
00:42:23.192 --> 00:42:24.846
To be with my family again.

698
00:42:24.846 --> 00:42:27.022
You will.

699
00:42:27.022 --> 00:42:29.372
And...

700
00:42:29.372 --> 00:42:31.200
Hey.

701
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.203
I'm sorry that we're always
at each other's throats.

702
00:42:34.203 --> 00:42:37.903
I know it has a lot more to do
with me than it does with you.

703
00:42:37.903 --> 00:42:40.862
I appreciate
you saying that.

704
00:42:40.862 --> 00:42:42.734
Even if it isn't true.

705
00:42:44.779 --> 00:42:46.215
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

706
00:43:05.365 --> 00:43:06.279
Any luck?

707
00:43:07.323 --> 00:43:09.064
Oh. fuck.

708
00:43:09.064 --> 00:43:10.109
Esther!

709
00:43:14.635 --> 00:43:18.247
Come here. I need to--
oh. shit.

710
00:43:22.382 --> 00:43:23.296
Damn it.

711
00:43:38.224 --> 00:43:39.138
What happened up there?

712
00:43:42.794 --> 00:43:44.143
Esther. she was...

713
00:43:46.972 --> 00:43:47.929
What?

714
00:43:50.062 --> 00:43:52.760
She leaned out too far and...

715
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.892
I couldn't--

716
00:43:57.722 --> 00:43:59.027
I'm sorry. Mia.

717
00:44:00.768 --> 00:44:03.031
I'm s... I'm so sorry.

718
00:44:08.733 --> 00:44:11.300
She was trying to
save us.

719
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.780
Oh. my god.

720
00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.303
They're gonna come in here
and kill us.

721
00:44:14.303 --> 00:44:15.957
I know it.
- Stop it. okay?

722
00:44:15.957 --> 00:44:18.133
We're safe in here for now.
Stop saying that.

723
00:44:18.133 --> 00:44:19.613
That's not true.

724
00:44:19.613 --> 00:44:21.789
There are people out there.

725
00:44:21.789 --> 00:44:23.878
They killed three of us
already with arrows.

726
00:44:23.878 --> 00:44:25.488
So how can you say that?

727
00:44:25.488 --> 00:44:27.273
I'm saying it
because I believe it.

728
00:44:27.273 --> 00:44:30.668
I'm saying it to all of you
because I believe it.

729
00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:31.843
Yeah.

730
00:44:31.843 --> 00:44:34.367
Well. Esther believed you too.

731
00:44:34.367 --> 00:44:37.152
When you told her to go up there
and make a phone call?

732
00:44:37.152 --> 00:44:39.720
Maybe you should have done it
yourself if it was so dangerous.

733
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.113
Divya.

734
00:44:41.113 --> 00:44:42.070
That is not fair.

735
00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:43.332
I don't care.

736
00:44:43.332 --> 00:44:45.030
I'm not being fair right now.

737
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:46.727
I'm calling Tess out on her
decisions so far.

738
00:44:46.727 --> 00:44:47.772
that's what I'm doing.

739
00:44:47.772 --> 00:44:50.644
That's fine.
Yeah. Fuck it.

740
00:44:50.644 --> 00:44:51.993
I'm gonna sit right here

741
00:44:51.993 --> 00:44:53.168
and you're going to tell us
what to do. Divya.

742
00:44:53.168 --> 00:44:55.170
since you have
such a big fucking mouth.

743
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:57.259
You're going to come up
with a plan for our survival.

744
00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:49.224
Evening. ladies.

745
00:45:50.617 --> 00:45:52.097
How's your party going?

746
00:45:55.361 --> 00:45:56.797
We've called the police.

747
00:45:56.797 --> 00:46:00.061
They're on their way
right now.

748
00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:03.891
Bullshit.
There's no signal out here.

749
00:46:03.891 --> 00:46:05.763
We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

750
00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:08.722
And if you had called.

751
00:46:08.722 --> 00:46:10.071
your friend wouldn't
have been hanging out

752
00:46:10.071 --> 00:46:12.465
the window back there
trying to get a few bars.

753
00:46:14.467 --> 00:46:18.471
I tell you what;
let's get this shit over with...

754
00:46:23.868 --> 00:46:25.783
Because if you don't do that.

755
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.698
try and do something smart.

756
00:46:28.698 --> 00:46:30.831
like. get away.

757
00:46:31.963 --> 00:46:33.834
I'm gonna set my guys
loose on you.

758
00:46:33.834 --> 00:46:35.662
And you're not gonna like that.

759
00:46:35.662 --> 00:46:37.838
Not one bit.
I promise you won't.

760
00:46:39.797 --> 00:46:40.885
And after all.

761
00:46:40.885 --> 00:46:44.236
that fucking and killing.

762
00:46:44.236 --> 00:46:47.892
we're still just gonna get
what we came for.

763
00:46:47.892 --> 00:46:49.807
So why don't you make it
easier on everybody

764
00:46:49.807 --> 00:46:51.243
and come outside?

765
00:46:53.506 --> 00:46:54.855
If you do that...

766
00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.032
right now.

767
00:46:58.032 --> 00:46:59.729
and this is the only chance

768
00:46:59.729 --> 00:47:01.340
I'm ever going to give you.

769
00:47:02.602 --> 00:47:04.996
I will let you go.

770
00:47:04.996 --> 00:47:07.389
You got my word on it.

771
00:47:07.389 --> 00:47:08.956
Open up that front door

772
00:47:08.956 --> 00:47:10.828
and walk right out.

773
00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:14.483
Leave your car.
Run down the road to safety.

774
00:47:14.483 --> 00:47:16.050
Right now.

775
00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.403
You got no idea who we are

776
00:47:21.403 --> 00:47:23.536
and all we want is
what's inside that house.

777
00:47:25.059 --> 00:47:26.234
What is it?
What's inside the house?

778
00:47:26.234 --> 00:47:27.845
What is he
talking about?

779
00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:28.976
What is it
they think is here.

780
00:47:28.976 --> 00:47:30.195
I have no idea.

781
00:47:30.195 --> 00:47:32.066
Please. Beth.
you got to tell us.

782
00:47:32.066 --> 00:47:34.112
That-- there's--
there's nothing here.

783
00:47:34.112 --> 00:47:36.897
- Please.
- She said she doesn't know.

784
00:47:36.897 --> 00:47:37.985
He is a liar.

785
00:47:37.985 --> 00:47:39.900
Tess. honestly.

786
00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.206
What's in here?

787
00:47:42.555 --> 00:47:43.512
Nothing I know off.

788
00:47:43.512 --> 00:47:44.862
Oh. come on.

789
00:47:44.862 --> 00:47:47.081
Even criminals don't
just attack for no reason.

790
00:47:47.081 --> 00:47:49.127
Yes. they do.
All the time.

791
00:47:49.127 --> 00:47:51.172
You know what I mean?

792
00:47:51.172 --> 00:47:54.045
He said he wants
what's inside the house.

793
00:47:54.045 --> 00:47:56.221
Why would they say
there's something here?

794
00:47:56.221 --> 00:47:57.831
Why would they
go through all this

795
00:47:57.831 --> 00:47:59.398
if there wasn't
anything to gain?

796
00:47:59.398 --> 00:48:01.313
To draw us out. to get--
get us out of the house?

797
00:48:01.313 --> 00:48:03.881
I don't know.
The only thing I know is

798
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:05.795
there isn't anything
of value in here.

799
00:48:05.795 --> 00:48:07.319
He's tricking us.

800
00:48:08.494 --> 00:48:10.365
He sounds serious to me.

801
00:48:13.803 --> 00:48:16.371
What the fuck is
taking so long?

802
00:48:16.371 --> 00:48:19.200
I don't know
what's happening here?

803
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:23.291
Why you think we have
anything of value?

804
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:24.727
But we don't.

805
00:48:24.727 --> 00:48:27.034
This is our parent's place

806
00:48:27.034 --> 00:48:31.734
and they don't have
a safe or antiques

807
00:48:31.734 --> 00:48:33.954
or anything like that.

808
00:48:33.954 --> 00:48:36.217
And if somebody
told you they do.

809
00:48:36.217 --> 00:48:38.959
they were lying to you. okay?

810
00:48:38.959 --> 00:48:43.746
So please. please.
please just leave.

811
00:48:43.746 --> 00:48:45.357
Please leave!

812
00:48:48.969 --> 00:48:50.318
Not what we heard.

813
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:55.454
Why don't you open up
that front door?

814
00:48:55.454 --> 00:48:57.412
Let us come inside
and take a look around.

815
00:48:57.412 --> 00:49:00.328
If that's true.
we'll walk away.

816
00:49:00.328 --> 00:49:02.243
And you all make it
through the night.

817
00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:05.159
It's up to you now.

818
00:49:06.856 --> 00:49:09.772
But this is my last offer...

819
00:49:09.772 --> 00:49:11.252
before bad things
start to happen.

820
00:49:11.252 --> 00:49:14.952
And I mean really bad
fucking things.

821
00:49:17.128 --> 00:49:19.565
I know who that is.
I know that voice.

822
00:49:19.565 --> 00:49:20.783
Who?

823
00:49:20.783 --> 00:49:22.785
The guy from the store today.

824
00:49:22.785 --> 00:49:26.224
I had words with him.

825
00:49:26.224 --> 00:49:28.313
He must have gotten
his friends and--

826
00:49:28.313 --> 00:49:31.359
and followed us or something.

827
00:49:31.359 --> 00:49:33.796
Yeah. The one who was
talking to us.

828
00:49:33.796 --> 00:49:35.015
Someone you just met. huh?

829
00:49:35.015 --> 00:49:36.321
What happened
at the store?

830
00:49:36.321 --> 00:49:37.539
What exactly did he say?

831
00:49:37.539 --> 00:49:38.627
What did you do to them?

832
00:49:38.627 --> 00:49:39.802
Nothing.
They were just being dicks

833
00:49:39.802 --> 00:49:40.978
and I got into it with them.

834
00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:43.589
Then tell them you're sorry.

835
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:45.808
If it's true.
and that's why they're here.

836
00:49:45.808 --> 00:49:46.809
just tell them
you didn't mean it.

837
00:49:46.809 --> 00:49:48.463
No. No. it can't be.

838
00:49:48.463 --> 00:49:51.989
He said we could leave.
He said it.

839
00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:54.556
No. Everything he says
is a lie.

840
00:49:54.556 --> 00:49:57.081
- Tess.
-  Oh. my fucking God.

841
00:49:57.081 --> 00:49:58.996
Listen to this bitch.

842
00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:01.955
She's gonna get us killed.
I'm serious.

843
00:50:01.955 --> 00:50:03.478
Well. I'm not
gonna open this door

844
00:50:03.478 --> 00:50:05.480
and let them walk in and hope
that nothing bad happens.

845
00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.439
You really want to play
that game with these animals?

846
00:50:08.614 --> 00:50:10.137
He said he would kill us.

847
00:50:10.137 --> 00:50:13.010
I know
what he fucking said.

848
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:16.665
Well. you are
the soldier person.

849
00:50:16.665 --> 00:50:18.537
So why don't you save us?

850
00:50:18.537 --> 00:50:21.105
I would if I could.

851
00:50:21.105 --> 00:50:23.150
Go on war hero.
Do something.

852
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:26.153
Bridget. stop.
Don't be an idiot.

853
00:50:26.153 --> 00:50:29.026
What? Fuck both of you!

854
00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:31.941
Stop being an asshole.
Bridget!

855
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:33.378
God.

856
00:50:35.771 --> 00:50:37.295
All right. ladies.

857
00:50:38.905 --> 00:50:40.211
Time's up.

858
00:50:42.082 --> 00:50:43.562
You've made your choice.

859
00:50:44.476 --> 00:50:47.087
I don't care how long it takes.

860
00:50:47.087 --> 00:50:49.524
We're gonna pick you off
one by one.

861
00:50:49.524 --> 00:50:51.570
and we're gonna
fucking enjoy it.

862
00:51:03.408 --> 00:51:04.409
Shit.

863
00:51:18.901 --> 00:51:21.252
Get to the middle.
Get in closer. Come on.

864
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:46.407
Billy is dead.

865
00:51:46.407 --> 00:51:48.366
What?

866
00:51:48.366 --> 00:51:50.281
I thought we hadn't heard from
him for a while.

867
00:51:50.281 --> 00:51:53.936
and then Cody found him
over by their fucking cars...

868
00:51:53.936 --> 00:51:55.764
They stabbed him.

869
00:51:55.764 --> 00:51:56.809
Fuck.

870
00:51:56.809 --> 00:51:59.420
They stabbed him.

871
00:52:02.597 --> 00:52:06.035
Okay. okay.

872
00:52:06.035 --> 00:52:08.255
You know
who it was. right?

873
00:52:10.605 --> 00:52:12.520
It was that
fucking army bitch.

874
00:52:14.653 --> 00:52:18.178
Okay. that's how
she wants to play?

875
00:52:18.178 --> 00:52:20.180
that's how we'll play.

876
00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:22.661
Dude. are you sure
about this?

877
00:52:24.228 --> 00:52:26.273
Dead sure.

878
00:52:26.273 --> 00:52:27.840
They fucking
killed him. man.

879
00:52:28.971 --> 00:52:30.799
He's dead.

880
00:52:30.799 --> 00:52:32.671
All right? Dead.

881
00:52:32.671 --> 00:52:35.804
I know. I heard you.

882
00:52:35.804 --> 00:52:38.285
And now they're gonna
pay for it. I promise.

883
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.205
Can't we
just bust in there...

884
00:52:45.205 --> 00:52:46.250
- No.
- And get the fuck-- ?

885
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:47.773
Come on.
- No. no. no.

886
00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:51.603
At first
I just wanted to spook 'em.

887
00:52:51.603 --> 00:52:55.563
I just wanted to scare 'em
a little bit and make 'em sweat.

888
00:52:55.563 --> 00:52:58.175
Now I want to toy with them.

889
00:52:58.175 --> 00:53:00.481
Now I want to have
a little fun

890
00:53:00.481 --> 00:53:04.268
because that's what
they deserve.

891
00:53:04.268 --> 00:53:09.229
Okay. Okay.
It just seems...

892
00:53:09.229 --> 00:53:10.926
What?

893
00:53:10.926 --> 00:53:12.580
I planned this for six months.

894
00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.756
We already started.
and we're not stopping now.

895
00:53:14.756 --> 00:53:16.976
I'm not gonna let
some shitbags ruin it for us.

896
00:53:21.372 --> 00:53:24.984
It's just. it's getting
kinda a little bit more

897
00:53:24.984 --> 00:53:26.855
than we bargained for here.

898
00:53:26.855 --> 00:53:28.596
Listen to me.

899
00:53:28.596 --> 00:53:30.903
You heard what those guys
said. right?

900
00:53:30.903 --> 00:53:32.121
This place has been sold.

901
00:53:32.121 --> 00:53:34.036
They were packing up
and moving on.

902
00:53:34.036 --> 00:53:36.865
The time is now.
This is it.

903
00:53:36.865 --> 00:53:38.693
Guys like us are never
gonna have another shot

904
00:53:38.693 --> 00:53:40.173
at money like this.

905
00:53:40.173 --> 00:53:42.001
Not ever.

906
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:43.176
And I want it.

907
00:53:43.176 --> 00:53:44.699
I want what they got in there.

908
00:53:44.699 --> 00:53:46.353
I want what they got
in the house.

909
00:53:46.353 --> 00:53:48.268
and I want to kill
that bitch as well.

910
00:53:48.268 --> 00:53:49.878
I'm gonna find her.

911
00:53:49.878 --> 00:53:50.966
and I'm gonna stick my knife

912
00:53:50.966 --> 00:53:52.620
right through her fucking skull.

913
00:54:03.152 --> 00:54:04.502
Shit.

914
00:54:12.292 --> 00:54:14.076
What the fuck
are they doing?

915
00:54:14.076 --> 00:54:16.731
Why are they just
sitting out there?

916
00:54:16.731 --> 00:54:20.996
Look. I'm sorry
about Rose. you know?

917
00:54:20.996 --> 00:54:23.042
I'm just...

918
00:54:23.042 --> 00:54:24.261
fucking scared.

919
00:54:25.697 --> 00:54:26.872
I understand.

920
00:54:28.569 --> 00:54:30.745
I have to be honest
with you. guys.

921
00:54:30.745 --> 00:54:33.531
If they get in here.
we don't really have a chance.

922
00:54:33.531 --> 00:54:35.097
So we have to do
something drastic

923
00:54:35.097 --> 00:54:36.490
and we need to do it now.

924
00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:38.449
We need to do something
that they don't expect.

925
00:54:38.449 --> 00:54:40.581
What if we all just took off
running across the fields

926
00:54:40.581 --> 00:54:42.148
in a bunch of
different directions?

927
00:54:42.148 --> 00:54:43.410
They have
weapons and trucks.

928
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:45.847
Still. Three or
four of us could make it.

929
00:54:47.849 --> 00:54:49.808
Okay. how you guys
feeling about that?

930
00:54:49.808 --> 00:54:51.636
A mass run out the door.
see what happens?

931
00:54:53.159 --> 00:54:56.597
Guys. it's better than
getting killed in here or worse.

932
00:54:56.597 --> 00:54:58.469
Tortured. raped. You know?

933
00:54:59.818 --> 00:55:00.906
Guys. come on.

934
00:55:00.906 --> 00:55:02.777
I don't think
I'd make it 50 yards.

935
00:55:02.777 --> 00:55:04.431
Yeah. me neither.

936
00:55:04.431 --> 00:55:05.519
Look at my shoes.

937
00:55:05.519 --> 00:55:06.955
I'm gonna get far barefoot?

938
00:55:06.955 --> 00:55:09.088
- Same.
-  Fine.

939
00:55:09.088 --> 00:55:10.307
It was just an idea.

940
00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:11.786
It's not
a bad idea. Divya.

941
00:55:11.786 --> 00:55:13.266
It just won't work.

942
00:55:13.266 --> 00:55:16.095
But something like it might.
Something more strategic.

943
00:55:18.532 --> 00:55:20.317
We need to attack.

944
00:55:20.317 --> 00:55:21.753
We need to bring
the fight to them

945
00:55:21.753 --> 00:55:23.537
or at least be prepared to fight
if they get in here.

946
00:55:23.537 --> 00:55:25.800
and they will get in here;
it's only a matter of time.

947
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.150
If a couple of us
take off running.

948
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:29.369
we could have a chance.

949
00:55:29.369 --> 00:55:32.285
Then what?
Leave the rest of us behind?

950
00:55:32.285 --> 00:55:33.286
No. no.
Just like I did before.

951
00:55:33.286 --> 00:55:34.418
but to arm ourselves.

952
00:55:34.418 --> 00:55:36.071
I have to get to
the toolshed. Beth.

953
00:55:36.071 --> 00:55:38.683
Let's all go there.
then. and lock ourselves in.

954
00:55:38.683 --> 00:55:40.815
No. we wouldn't make it.
Not all of us.

955
00:55:40.815 --> 00:55:42.426
Fucking hell.

956
00:55:42.426 --> 00:55:43.775
I'm just being honest.

957
00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:46.908
We wouldn't all make it
but I could make it.

958
00:55:46.908 --> 00:55:49.389
I could get there.
grab some ammo and some rifles.

959
00:55:49.389 --> 00:55:51.870
get back here so that we
possibly have a chance.

960
00:55:53.219 --> 00:55:55.700
That's-- that's the good news.

961
00:55:57.092 --> 00:56:00.269
My other idea
is the caretaker's cottage.

962
00:56:00.269 --> 00:56:01.793
just down the hill.

963
00:56:01.793 --> 00:56:03.534
It still has
a working landline.

964
00:56:03.534 --> 00:56:05.362
But the problem
is the caretakers.

965
00:56:05.362 --> 00:56:06.580
We don't know
if they're in on this or--

966
00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.234
or if they'll be there.

967
00:56:08.234 --> 00:56:10.367
Or what?
I mean. we have no idea.

968
00:56:10.367 --> 00:56:13.761
But one of you
needs to race out there.

969
00:56:13.761 --> 00:56:16.677
draw some attention to yourself.
break in. call 911.

970
00:56:16.677 --> 00:56:18.853
and then take off
and never look back.

971
00:56:18.853 --> 00:56:22.857
You mean.
that person will get away?

972
00:56:22.857 --> 00:56:27.384
I mean. after they make
the call or whatever?

973
00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:29.690
Maybe.
Means a lot of "maybes."

974
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:31.344
A lot of things have to happen
for them to get away.

975
00:56:31.344 --> 00:56:34.173
But there's a chance. yes.

976
00:56:34.173 --> 00:56:35.740
It's not a terrible plan.

977
00:56:36.871 --> 00:56:39.308
But I have to tell you.
I will be using you as bait.

978
00:56:39.308 --> 00:56:40.832
I want them to chase you.

979
00:56:43.574 --> 00:56:45.402
It's not a suicide mission exactly.

980
00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:47.404
but it's not great.

981
00:56:47.404 --> 00:56:48.840
Hey. get over here.

982
00:56:50.102 --> 00:56:51.538
Hey.

983
00:56:54.628 --> 00:56:57.109
If we're gonna do anything.
we need to do it now.

984
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:59.067
Anyone?

985
00:56:59.067 --> 00:57:00.547
I'll do it.

986
00:57:00.547 --> 00:57:04.246
What? Mia. no.
That is insane.

987
00:57:04.246 --> 00:57:06.118
Anybody else
run track in school?

988
00:57:10.949 --> 00:57:15.127
I didn't think so. But I did.
I ran track and I was fast.

989
00:57:15.127 --> 00:57:18.260
I was really fast. So...

990
00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.480
it makes sense
that it's me.

991
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:24.005
And if I make it.
then I will see you ladies

992
00:57:24.005 --> 00:57:28.445
at Denny's tomorrow morning
for breakfast.

993
00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:31.883
And if I don't. then...

994
00:57:38.237 --> 00:57:39.934
You can have my car keys.

995
00:57:39.934 --> 00:57:41.675
if you can use them.

996
00:57:43.808 --> 00:57:45.287
Does anybody have a hair tie?

997
00:57:45.287 --> 00:57:46.941
Yeah. I do.

998
00:57:46.941 --> 00:57:48.465
You need to go
out the kitchen door.

999
00:57:48.465 --> 00:57:50.467
Okay? Make some noise.
I want them to see you.

1000
00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:52.164
- Okay.
-  Run as fast as you can.

1001
00:57:52.164 --> 00:57:54.122
Get to the house. call 911.

1002
00:57:54.122 --> 00:57:55.297
I'll do the rest.

1003
00:57:55.297 --> 00:57:57.212
Okay. Um...

1004
00:57:59.824 --> 00:58:03.567
Um... Beth. can you hand me
those sneakers?

1005
00:58:03.567 --> 00:58:05.786
I don't think he's going to
use them anymore.

1006
00:58:05.786 --> 00:58:08.267
Ten seconds after
she runs out of that door.

1007
00:58:08.267 --> 00:58:09.877
I will follow her.

1008
00:58:09.877 --> 00:58:11.792
God. you really were
in the army. weren't you?

1009
00:58:11.792 --> 00:58:13.881
I was. For a long time.

1010
00:58:13.881 --> 00:58:15.622
Remember. it's two knocks
and then one.

1011
00:58:15.622 --> 00:58:17.842
If anything else
they get in here.

1012
00:58:17.842 --> 00:58:20.018
you run.
you fight to the death.

1013
00:58:20.018 --> 00:58:22.020
whatever you have to do
to stay alive.

1014
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:25.502
I will find a way back inside
to get you.

1015
00:58:25.502 --> 00:58:27.460
Okay?

1016
00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:28.853
Okay.

1017
00:58:34.946 --> 00:58:37.122
I'll see you bitches
at brunch tomorrow.

1018
00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:42.519
Let's do this.

1019
00:58:46.566 --> 00:58:47.785
Come on. Let's go.

1020
00:58:59.144 --> 00:59:01.407
Thank you.
You're really fucking cool.

1021
00:59:01.407 --> 00:59:05.237
Thanks.
Hey. um. full disclosure.

1022
00:59:05.237 --> 00:59:09.458
I always wanted to ask you out.
I never had the guts to do it.

1023
00:59:09.458 --> 00:59:11.417
Just so you know.

1024
00:59:11.417 --> 00:59:13.941
Yeah. big crush.
all this time.

1025
00:59:13.941 --> 00:59:16.378
Okay.

1026
00:59:16.378 --> 00:59:17.771
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1027
01:00:15.481 --> 01:00:17.962
Hey! Assholes!

1028
01:00:19.137 --> 01:00:20.747
Go fuck yourselves.

1029
01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:29.713
You got this.

1030
01:00:56.478 --> 01:00:59.307
Where's it?
Where is the phone?

1031
01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:03.747
Where's the fucking phone.

1032
01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:13.539
Come on. Come on.

1033
01:01:13.539 --> 01:01:16.194
- No! No. what?

1034
01:01:25.899 --> 01:01:29.773
No. no.
No. no. no. no. no.

1035
01:01:29.773 --> 01:01:31.992
No. no. no. no. no. no.

1036
01:02:22.608 --> 01:02:23.783
Was that it?

1037
01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:26.786
Is that...?

1038
01:02:26.786 --> 01:02:28.701
Is that Tess?

1039
01:02:28.701 --> 01:02:29.789
It can't be.

1040
01:02:32.183 --> 01:02:33.750
- That's Tess.
- She said she would come in

1041
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.577
through the back door.
- No.

1042
01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:37.101
It's the front door.

1043
01:02:37.101 --> 01:02:38.145
Why does
she need to get in?

1044
01:02:38.145 --> 01:02:39.364
Why does she need to get in?

1045
01:02:39.364 --> 01:02:41.453
She said. two. then one.
- It was two and one.

1046
01:02:41.453 --> 01:02:43.063
That was two and one. right?

1047
01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:44.586
We can't leave her out there.
-  Divya. just wait.

1048
01:02:44.586 --> 01:02:45.718
We cannot leave her out there.

1049
01:02:45.718 --> 01:02:46.675
Come on.
-  Divya. just wait.

1050
01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:47.807
Just wait. Divya.

1051
01:02:47.807 --> 01:02:49.113
But what if it's her?

1052
01:02:49.113 --> 01:02:50.244
What if it's her?
-  Tess?

1053
01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.727
Tess. is that you?

1054
01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:57.295
Seriously. is that you. or?

1055
01:03:10.743 --> 01:03:11.744
Oh. god! Oh. god!

1056
01:03:25.105 --> 01:03:28.456
Spread out. Find them.

1057
01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:30.458
They're here somewhere.

1058
01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:31.851
So find them.

1059
01:05:18.088 --> 01:05:20.655
No. no!
Help me! Help me!

1060
01:05:20.655 --> 01:05:22.266
Aaaahh!

1061
01:05:33.712 --> 01:05:34.931
Oh. shit.

1062
01:06:01.348 --> 01:06:02.523
Shit.

1063
01:06:03.568 --> 01:06:05.744
Tell me
what the fuck is going on!

1064
01:06:05.744 --> 01:06:07.746
I can't. I can't.

1065
01:06:07.746 --> 01:06:08.965
Talk to me!

1066
01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.923
Can you untie me. please?

1067
01:06:10.923 --> 01:06:12.272
Please untie me so--

1068
01:06:12.272 --> 01:06:13.665
Why are they after us?

1069
01:06:15.145 --> 01:06:16.973
Why?
- I-- I don't know.

1070
01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.452
Bullshit.

1071
01:06:18.452 --> 01:06:19.453
Tell me. Now!

1072
01:06:19.453 --> 01:06:23.109
Okay. Okay.
Because we... we--

1073
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:24.241
we told 'em about...

1074
01:06:24.241 --> 01:06:26.156
What? You told them what?

1075
01:06:26.156 --> 01:06:28.332
About the money! The money.

1076
01:06:28.332 --> 01:06:30.073
What are you talking about?

1077
01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:31.988
Please untie me so I...

1078
01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.337
You'll tell me
what the fuck is going on

1079
01:06:33.337 --> 01:06:34.773
or I'm gonna leave you here
to die.

1080
01:06:34.773 --> 01:06:36.340
Okay. okay.

1081
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:40.126
Okay. okay.

1082
01:06:40.126 --> 01:06:42.259
These local guys.

1083
01:06:42.259 --> 01:06:45.088
we used to push products sometimes.

1084
01:06:45.088 --> 01:06:47.003
They-- they found out
about the cash

1085
01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.526
that we've been
storing in the house

1086
01:06:48.526 --> 01:06:49.831
and they broke in here

1087
01:06:49.831 --> 01:06:51.181
and they said
they were gonna kill us.

1088
01:06:51.181 --> 01:06:54.010
so... we told them
about you guys at the house.

1089
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:56.751
We-- we told them
that you're with us.

1090
01:06:57.883 --> 01:06:59.537
That you were our girlfriends.

1091
01:07:00.973 --> 01:07:02.409
What?

1092
01:07:02.409 --> 01:07:04.672
We were just trying
to stay alive. that's all.

1093
01:07:04.672 --> 01:07:06.761
I-- I swear.

1094
01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:07.719
Oh. shit.

1095
01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.380
I'm gonna cut you out.

1096
01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.034
and you're gonna help me.
do you understand?

1097
01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:22.690
Yeah. okay.

1098
01:07:32.396 --> 01:07:34.050
Where are my father's guns?

1099
01:07:37.009 --> 01:07:38.097
Where are the guns?

1100
01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:39.620
Fuck this.

1101
01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:54.766
You fucking killed Billy.

1102
01:07:57.421 --> 01:07:59.901
You should have run
when you coulda.

1103
01:07:59.901 --> 01:08:00.815
I don't do that.

1104
01:08:06.517 --> 01:08:08.171
The fuck?

1105
01:08:35.285 --> 01:08:37.504
Well. well. well.
look what we got here.

1106
01:08:38.984 --> 01:08:40.464
Little girl gang.

1107
01:08:45.991 --> 01:08:48.646
Potato peeler? really?

1108
01:08:50.822 --> 01:08:52.867
Look at these little bitches.

1109
01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:54.304
Scared shitless.

1110
01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.395
Where is she?

1111
01:09:00.484 --> 01:09:02.312
You know who I'm talking about.

1112
01:09:05.053 --> 01:09:06.925
You remember me?

1113
01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:08.405
Any of you?

1114
01:09:08.405 --> 01:09:11.190
Y'all too busy buying
Haagen-Daz and shit today?

1115
01:09:11.190 --> 01:09:14.150
I've...
I've never seen you before.

1116
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:17.153
No? You didn't
stop in town

1117
01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.632
at the little store
they got there?

1118
01:09:18.632 --> 01:09:21.200
No. We just...

1119
01:09:22.245 --> 01:09:23.681
we came straight here.

1120
01:09:24.812 --> 01:09:26.292
For the party.

1121
01:09:26.292 --> 01:09:28.425
Right. right.

1122
01:09:28.425 --> 01:09:31.123
Well. too bad for you then.

1123
01:09:31.123 --> 01:09:32.342
I remember you.

1124
01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:34.561
Good.

1125
01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:39.305
I've shown you my face.

1126
01:09:40.654 --> 01:09:42.265
You understand
what that means?

1127
01:09:44.571 --> 01:09:47.139
It means none of you
are leaving here alive.

1128
01:09:48.488 --> 01:09:50.708
Unless
we come to a deal.

1129
01:09:50.708 --> 01:09:53.145
You got that? Right now.

1130
01:09:53.145 --> 01:09:54.712
We come to an agreement.

1131
01:09:54.712 --> 01:09:57.671
and you stick to it
and so will I.

1132
01:09:57.671 --> 01:09:59.195
What do you want?

1133
01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:03.286
Hm. That's funny.

1134
01:10:03.286 --> 01:10:05.375
You must be the funny one.
I like that.

1135
01:10:06.767 --> 01:10:08.291
Can you believe these chicks
are drug dealers?

1136
01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:10.554
I mean.
it's a bit of a stretch. but.

1137
01:10:10.554 --> 01:10:13.209
What? Drug dealers?

1138
01:10:14.688 --> 01:10:17.343
What are you talking about?
That is so...

1139
01:10:18.736 --> 01:10:21.086
We came here
for a bachelorette party

1140
01:10:21.086 --> 01:10:25.395
and you attacked us.
Please just...

1141
01:10:25.395 --> 01:10:26.787
And I'm sure you know
nothing about the cash

1142
01:10:26.787 --> 01:10:28.311
they got up in the attic
either. huh?

1143
01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:31.792
There's no cash.
There's no cash.

1144
01:10:31.792 --> 01:10:33.272
Where's the army cunt?

1145
01:10:36.319 --> 01:10:37.842
Where is she?

1146
01:10:37.842 --> 01:10:40.888
I will fucking kill you
right now if you don't tell me.

1147
01:10:40.888 --> 01:10:42.325
She's outside.

1148
01:10:44.196 --> 01:10:46.546
She ran out to try
and make a call or--

1149
01:10:46.546 --> 01:10:49.070
or help or get guns
or something.

1150
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:51.116
anything she could do
to help us.

1151
01:10:51.116 --> 01:10:52.335
I-- I am telling the truth.

1152
01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:54.554
She's outside. I-- I promise.

1153
01:10:54.554 --> 01:10:56.861
Hear from Cody
about the other one?

1154
01:10:56.861 --> 01:10:58.079
Uh-uh.

1155
01:10:58.079 --> 01:10:59.429
How about Dick?

1156
01:11:01.126 --> 01:11:02.475
Mm-mm.

1157
01:11:02.475 --> 01:11:04.825
Look. maybe
there is money here

1158
01:11:04.825 --> 01:11:06.827
or whatever. okay?

1159
01:11:06.827 --> 01:11:10.266
But we don't know
anything about that.

1160
01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:13.007
We are just guests.

1161
01:11:14.444 --> 01:11:17.316
Maybe Tess is mixed up
in all of this.

1162
01:11:17.316 --> 01:11:18.622
I don't know. I mean.
I wouldn't put it past her.

1163
01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:19.710
She's been really fucked up

1164
01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:21.146
since she came back
from the war.

1165
01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:23.975
But that is not us.

1166
01:11:23.975 --> 01:11:25.759
That has nothing
to do with us.

1167
01:11:25.759 --> 01:11:28.240
Shh. Bridget. stop it.
Stop talk--

1168
01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.590
stop telling them shit.

1169
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:33.941
You really gonna listen to
Black chick tell you what to do?

1170
01:11:33.941 --> 01:11:36.335
Come on. Be your own woman.

1171
01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:44.517
All right.
You done helpin' me out?

1172
01:11:53.134 --> 01:11:55.963
- I guess she is.
- Mother fucker!

1173
01:11:58.444 --> 01:11:59.967
Oh. shut the fuck up.

1174
01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:05.059
You two. asses on the couch
if you want to live.

1175
01:12:06.278 --> 01:12:07.497
Right now.

1176
01:12:09.455 --> 01:12:11.457
I'm going to the attic
to check it out.

1177
01:12:11.457 --> 01:12:12.632
If I find the cash.
I'll let you know.

1178
01:12:12.632 --> 01:12:14.199
We'll start hauling it down.

1179
01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:15.635
Hey. You think
maybe we should

1180
01:12:15.635 --> 01:12:17.594
get the fuck out of here?

1181
01:12:17.594 --> 01:12:19.335
We already got all the stuff
from the shed.

1182
01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:20.640
ain't that enough?

1183
01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.861
It's a lot of meth.
I'm just sayin'.

1184
01:12:23.861 --> 01:12:26.342
If it was.
we'd be gone already.

1185
01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:27.560
You understand that?

1186
01:12:29.257 --> 01:12:30.911
This is money.

1187
01:12:30.911 --> 01:12:32.696
Cash money I want it all.

1188
01:12:32.696 --> 01:12:34.262
I want the money.
I want the girl.

1189
01:12:34.262 --> 01:12:35.960
so shut your mouth
and do what I say.

1190
01:12:44.142 --> 01:12:45.796
That chick's coming back here.

1191
01:12:45.796 --> 01:12:47.188
and when she does
we need to be ready.

1192
01:12:47.188 --> 01:12:48.755
So you find her.
you bring her to me.

1193
01:12:50.322 --> 01:12:51.715
Till then watch them.

1194
01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:56.154
Kill them if they
so much as sneeze.

1195
01:12:56.154 --> 01:12:57.416
Can we fuck 'em?

1196
01:12:59.505 --> 01:13:01.289
When we're done. yeah.

1197
01:13:02.508 --> 01:13:04.423
Not until we get
what we came for.

1198
01:13:04.423 --> 01:13:05.642
Got it?

1199
01:13:05.642 --> 01:13:06.730
Got it.

1200
01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:09.183
When it's time.
which one you want?

1201
01:14:12.099 --> 01:14:13.187
I don't care.

1202
01:14:14.972 --> 01:14:16.016
Either one.

1203
01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:21.892
The black one. I guess.

1204
01:14:21.892 --> 01:14:23.807
Oh. look at you.

1205
01:14:23.807 --> 01:14:26.113
Fucking dark horse
is what you are.

1206
01:14:26.113 --> 01:14:27.506
Hey.

1207
01:14:27.506 --> 01:14:28.507
You want to fuck me?

1208
01:14:28.507 --> 01:14:30.117
What are you doing?

1209
01:14:30.117 --> 01:14:32.468
Stop.
- Go ahead and do it.

1210
01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.470
I won't scream or anything...

1211
01:14:35.601 --> 01:14:37.385
if you let us go after.

1212
01:14:37.385 --> 01:14:39.431
- Shut up.
-  No.

1213
01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:41.128
Let her talk.

1214
01:14:41.128 --> 01:14:42.478
You'd do what?

1215
01:14:43.435 --> 01:14:44.392
Say it again.

1216
01:14:44.392 --> 01:14:45.698
Fuck you...

1217
01:14:48.658 --> 01:14:50.137
or suck your cock.

1218
01:14:51.356 --> 01:14:54.011
Oh. you little
piece of shit.

1219
01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:55.142
You would. wouldn't you?

1220
01:14:55.142 --> 01:14:58.319
Of course I would.
I want to live.

1221
01:14:58.319 --> 01:15:00.321
So...

1222
01:15:00.321 --> 01:15:03.107
please...

1223
01:15:03.107 --> 01:15:04.238
let me do that.

1224
01:15:09.069 --> 01:15:10.201
He said to wait.

1225
01:15:11.898 --> 01:15:14.118
Fuck it.

1226
01:15:14.118 --> 01:15:16.207
I'm not gonna stop her
if she wants to put my dick

1227
01:15:16.207 --> 01:15:17.730
in her mouth so badly.

1228
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:21.125
You go ahead.

1229
01:15:21.125 --> 01:15:22.561
Okay.

1230
01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:24.041
Then you let us go.

1231
01:15:26.652 --> 01:15:28.219
Let's see how you do first.

1232
01:15:51.895 --> 01:15:53.113
Agh!

1233
01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:13.612
How many more?

1234
01:16:13.612 --> 01:16:15.614
Just one. Upstairs.

1235
01:16:15.614 --> 01:16:17.181
- Gun?
- I didn't see any.

1236
01:16:19.444 --> 01:16:20.880
You do what you want
to that one

1237
01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.621
and then you run
and don't look back.

1238
01:16:22.621 --> 01:16:24.623
We'll take care of this one.
Don't you worry.

1239
01:16:40.683 --> 01:16:41.901
Oh. come on.

1240
01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:45.905
Oh. I want it all.

1241
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:50.649
Oh. come on.

1242
01:16:50.649 --> 01:16:52.085
No rush.

1243
01:16:53.347 --> 01:16:54.740
You're the last one left.

1244
01:16:58.004 --> 01:16:59.310
Wow.

1245
01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:01.312
That is a lot of money.

1246
01:17:01.312 --> 01:17:02.618
Yeah.

1247
01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:06.056
You're one tough little shit.
aren't you?

1248
01:17:09.494 --> 01:17:10.713
I am.

1249
01:17:13.759 --> 01:17:15.848
Which one
was your boyfriend?

1250
01:17:15.848 --> 01:17:18.111
Not that it matters.
they're both dead.

1251
01:17:18.111 --> 01:17:20.026
but still...

1252
01:17:20.026 --> 01:17:22.681
you were really fucking
slumming it. weren't you?

1253
01:17:22.681 --> 01:17:25.902
Must make you
a nasty little junkie.

1254
01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.035
You still don't get it.

1255
01:17:31.734 --> 01:17:33.170
It was just a party.

1256
01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:38.131
Oh. fuck.

1257
01:17:40.525 --> 01:17:42.919
My bad.

1258
01:17:42.919 --> 01:17:45.269
Just wrong place. wrong time
for you girls. huh?

1259
01:17:46.618 --> 01:17:47.924
I guess so.

1260
01:17:56.933 --> 01:17:58.978
Just turn around
and walk away.

1261
01:17:58.978 --> 01:18:01.633
You do that right now.
and I won't follow you.

1262
01:18:01.633 --> 01:18:04.157
I promise.

1263
01:18:04.157 --> 01:18:05.419
I can't do that.

1264
01:18:06.551 --> 01:18:08.248
I'm gonna kill you.

1265
01:18:08.248 --> 01:18:10.903
Holy shit.

1266
01:18:10.903 --> 01:18:13.732
I'm giving you an out now.
so take it.

1267
01:18:13.732 --> 01:18:16.343
- I don't want it.
- Motherfucker.

1268
01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:18.998
We don't need to do
this shit anymore. all right?

1269
01:18:18.998 --> 01:18:20.870
So let's come to
an understanding or something.

1270
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:27.224
Wow.

1271
01:18:28.399 --> 01:18:30.183
Silent treatment. huh?

1272
01:18:32.795 --> 01:18:35.232
Why do women gotta be
so fucking difficult?

1273
01:18:39.062 --> 01:18:40.367
Let's go.

1274
01:19:13.618 --> 01:19:15.446
You fucked
with the wrong girls.

1275
01:20:29.259 --> 01:20:30.347
Oh. fuck it.

1276
01:21:35.368 --> 01:21:36.935
So...

1277
01:21:38.154 --> 01:21:40.069
why don't you tell us again...

1278
01:21:40.983 --> 01:21:42.549
what happened?

1279
01:21:42.549 --> 01:21:44.595
Real slow.

1280
01:21:44.595 --> 01:21:46.249
so we can all follow along.

1281
01:21:48.816 --> 01:21:50.557
I'm sorry.
that sounds like an order.

1282
01:21:50.557 --> 01:21:53.038
I thought this was an interview
that I granted you.

1283
01:21:56.476 --> 01:21:58.087
Please.

1284
01:22:00.611 --> 01:22:03.962
Okay. Which part?

1285
01:22:03.962 --> 01:22:06.051
The attack part.

1286
01:22:06.051 --> 01:22:08.924
The attack on all you girls
at your daddy's house.

1287
01:22:10.142 --> 01:22:11.752
It's my parents' house.

1288
01:22:11.752 --> 01:22:14.103
My father and my mother
own it.

1289
01:22:14.103 --> 01:22:16.453
Mind if we record this?

1290
01:22:16.453 --> 01:22:19.151
I didn't think it was
that kind of a meeting. Frank.

1291
01:22:19.151 --> 01:22:21.719
It's not Bev.
Just asking.

1292
01:22:21.719 --> 01:22:23.460
Then I'd prefer you didn't.

1293
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:24.504
Fine.

1294
01:22:24.504 --> 01:22:26.071
Now. you said before

1295
01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:27.986
that you tried to keep
these men out of the house

1296
01:22:27.986 --> 01:22:32.425
by blocking the windows
and locking all the doors.

1297
01:22:32.425 --> 01:22:33.818
that kind of thing?

1298
01:22:33.818 --> 01:22:35.298
Yes.

1299
01:22:37.126 --> 01:22:40.085
But that at some point
they overpowered you.

1300
01:22:40.085 --> 01:22:43.306
and they took you all hostage
inside the main property.

1301
01:22:43.306 --> 01:22:44.524
Inside.

1302
01:22:48.528 --> 01:22:50.008
Correct.

1303
01:22:50.008 --> 01:22:51.792
I believe
she already covered that

1304
01:22:51.792 --> 01:22:53.620
in her initial statement.

1305
01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:54.621
Well. that's good.

1306
01:22:54.621 --> 01:22:55.971
That's good. because now

1307
01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:58.190
she won't have any trouble
reviewing it again

1308
01:22:58.190 --> 01:23:00.279
a second time. will you?

1309
01:23:01.933 --> 01:23:03.239
No. I don't.

1310
01:23:03.239 --> 01:23:06.155
But I do have a problem
with your tone. Sheriff.

1311
01:23:06.155 --> 01:23:08.418
I'm not the guilty party here.

1312
01:23:08.418 --> 01:23:09.941
None of us are.

1313
01:23:09.941 --> 01:23:11.203
We are the victims.

1314
01:23:11.203 --> 01:23:13.684
And if nothing else.
we'd like your sympathy.

1315
01:23:15.207 --> 01:23:19.298
You're telling me
that these guys came in there.

1316
01:23:19.298 --> 01:23:24.129
took over. killed a whole bunch
of you ladies.

1317
01:23:24.129 --> 01:23:25.913
and then once they got
what they wanted.

1318
01:23:25.913 --> 01:23:27.132
turned on each other

1319
01:23:27.132 --> 01:23:29.656
and started killing
themselves instead.

1320
01:23:29.656 --> 01:23:31.006
Meanwhile. outside.

1321
01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:33.008
up at that tool shed
you got on the property.

1322
01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:35.140
out on the lawn.
up in the attic.

1323
01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:38.622
a fucking bloodbath.

1324
01:23:38.622 --> 01:23:43.670
And then. at some point.
at some point. the three of you

1325
01:23:43.670 --> 01:23:46.021
overpowered two of these boys.

1326
01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:48.632
and then you killed them
in self-defense

1327
01:23:48.632 --> 01:23:51.939
with fucking potato peelers
and garden shears

1328
01:23:51.939 --> 01:23:53.724
and shit like that.

1329
01:23:53.724 --> 01:23:55.247
And then.

1330
01:23:55.247 --> 01:23:58.120
you escaped on foot.

1331
01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.252
undetected by anyone.

1332
01:24:00.252 --> 01:24:03.995
and made it all the way
back into town.

1333
01:24:03.995 --> 01:24:05.649
Is that what I'm
supposed to believe?

1334
01:24:07.607 --> 01:24:08.739
That's right.

1335
01:24:10.915 --> 01:24:14.962
Well. I don't.
I just do not.

1336
01:24:14.962 --> 01:24:17.008
Well. I'm sorry.
That is what happened.

1337
01:24:17.008 --> 01:24:19.271
Horseshit. young lady. Horseshit.

1338
01:24:19.271 --> 01:24:21.882
I'm sorry.
is that a question?

1339
01:24:21.882 --> 01:24:24.798
You know exactly
what that is.

1340
01:24:24.798 --> 01:24:26.365
I see.

1341
01:24:26.365 --> 01:24:29.586
Is there anything further
you need from her at this point?

1342
01:24:37.202 --> 01:24:39.335
No. I guess not.

1343
01:24:39.335 --> 01:24:41.989
I mean. I got a shitload
of questions.

1344
01:24:41.989 --> 01:24:44.601
But I think I'll save 'em
for another time

1345
01:24:44.601 --> 01:24:46.385
and all those lawsuits

1346
01:24:46.385 --> 01:24:48.953
I know will start
coming down your way.

1347
01:24:48.953 --> 01:24:50.433
I will tell you this though...

1348
01:24:54.132 --> 01:24:56.047
I hope I never see you
or any of those girls

1349
01:24:56.047 --> 01:24:58.180
up in these parts.
not ever again.

1350
01:24:59.485 --> 01:25:01.270
You understand
what I'm saying?

1351
01:25:02.793 --> 01:25:04.925
Yes. that's very clear.

1352
01:25:04.925 --> 01:25:06.144
And just to be more clear.

1353
01:25:06.144 --> 01:25:08.233
you're telling me
that you and your sisters

1354
01:25:08.233 --> 01:25:10.540
had no idea
what was going on out there

1355
01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:14.413
with those caretakers
and their meth lab and all that.

1356
01:25:14.413 --> 01:25:16.372
That you just happened
to come up there that night

1357
01:25:16.372 --> 01:25:20.506
for your little party.
and all this shit came down

1358
01:25:20.506 --> 01:25:25.163
by some very strange
and almost impossible

1359
01:25:25.163 --> 01:25:27.252
goddamn coincidence?

1360
01:25:30.212 --> 01:25:32.214
Yeah...

1361
01:25:32.214 --> 01:25:34.651
Just wrong place.
wrong time. I guess.

1362
01:26:05.986 --> 01:26:06.900
What'd they ask you about--?

1363
01:27:05.045 --> 01:27:05.959
You okay?

1364
01:27:07.178 --> 01:27:09.572
No. but I will be.

1365
01:27:10.747 --> 01:27:11.791
Let's go.
