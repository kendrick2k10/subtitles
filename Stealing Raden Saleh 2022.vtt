00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:31.500
Hold it. Hold.

16
00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:34.875
A painting with
countless mysteries behind it.

17
00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:38.875
Did I hear 900 million?

18
00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:45.875
-Mr. Robert! With 900 million rupiah!
-Get ready to raise.

19
00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:51.833
How about 950 million rupiah?

20
00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:54.416
There's a mystery behind it.

21
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.666
-It would look beautiful on display.
-Fake?

22
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.250
Nine hundred and fifty million.
ladies and gentlemen?

23
00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:03.583
That's good.

24
00:04:06.416 --> 00:04:08.916
All right.
Nine hundred million going once.

25
00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.958
Do you know the master forger?

26
00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:15.625
Nine hundred million going twice.

27
00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:20.000
Nine hundred million going thrice.

28
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:24.666
Sold to Mr. Robert. Thank you.

29
00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:34.250
<i>Piko. Dini has sent</i>
<i>the 50 million to my crypto.</i>

30
00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:37.666
<i>Since the market is on the rise.</i>
<i>do you want to wait. or…</i>

31
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.250
Ucup. sorry I can't wait.

32
00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:41.916
My tuition fee is due this month.

33
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.125
<i>Okay. I'll close it</i>
<i>and send it to you right away.</i>

34
00:04:45.208 --> 00:04:48.083
All right. I'm going to
the visiting room. Bye.

35
00:04:56.708 --> 00:05:00.333
Ucup. I don't know how you get
your hands on these things.

36
00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:01.916
Awesome.

37
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.833
By the way. don't forget
my Bob Dylan harmonica.

38
00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:06.791
Just pay for that one first.

39
00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:08.500
Harmonica is easy-peasy.

40
00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:11.541
Okay. I'll transfer it now.

41
00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:15.708
Here you go.

42
00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:19.500
-No problem.
-Coffee. Ucup?

43
00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:21.625
Hey. thanks.

44
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.041
-I should go now.
-What? What's the rush?

45
00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:30.625
-I thought you wanted the Bob Dylan thing.
-You got it already?

46
00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:32.500
-That's crazy.
-Yep!

47
00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:35.500
Hey. Lan! Put everything on my tab.

48
00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:37.583
-Hey. thanks. Man.
-No worries.

49
00:05:39.708 --> 00:05:40.708
Veggies!

50
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.291
Veggies!

51
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:49.916
LEGAL ACTION BEING TAKEN
OVER LAND AND BUILDING!

52
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.916
Oh no! Stop!

53
00:05:58.333 --> 00:06:01.500
Piko! Cut the power! Now!

54
00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:05.958
All good?

55
00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:10.666
It should be.

56
00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:12.708
That's never happened before.

57
00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:13.958
I wonder too.

58
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.875
Hey. Why didn't you tell me
that Sarah was there?

59
00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.458
I felt bad.

60
00:06:21.541 --> 00:06:23.208
You know her.

61
00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:27.625
She hates it when
she doesn't know what I'm doing.

62
00:06:28.416 --> 00:06:30.875
What's so bad about
being friends with her anyway?

63
00:06:32.583 --> 00:06:34.916
<i>Do you have the money</i>
<i>to pay for the meal here?</i>

64
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.750
I can't chip in for now.

65
00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:40.041
Don't worry. You just sit down
and enjoy the meal.

66
00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:42.666
Ucup and I just hit the jackpot.

67
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.208
If you keep yourself busy
with Ucup all the time.

68
00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:48.166
when will you finish your final project?

69
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.208
You said you didn't want to pay
the tuition fees anymore.

70
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:54.791
You wanted to hold an exhibition
in a gallery.

71
00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:56.500
-Sarah…
-The offer is right in front of you.

72
00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.500
What's in front of us now
is an expensive and delicious meal.

73
00:06:59.583 --> 00:07:01.166
Are you sure you don't want
to finish it first?

74
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.875
We don't come from wealthy families.

75
00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.875
We can't just relax while waiting
for our parents to send us money.

76
00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:10.625
I should join the National Sports Week

77
00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:13.791
so they continue giving me the scholarship
and I can start my thesis.

78
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.916
You?

79
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
You've struggled. paying for tuition.

80
00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:20.500
You're just going to
let it go down the drain at the end?

81
00:07:20.583 --> 00:07:23.625
What I'm trying to build with Ucup
will give me a settled life.

82
00:07:23.708 --> 00:07:24.708
It's always Ucup.

83
00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:27.833
Why is he always involved
in the things that you're not telling me?

84
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.458
What a perfect dinner.

85
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.500
Guys. sorry for being late.

86
00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:46.916
Thank goodness you've ordered
something. I'm starving.

87
00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:48.750
Let me have some.

88
00:07:55.916 --> 00:07:57.250
Is our athlete on a diet?

89
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.916
Why aren't you eating?

90
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.166
Here. just eat everything.

91
00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.125
Thanks. Sarah.

92
00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:10.541
Anyway.

93
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.625
National Sports Week is in four months.
You must be doing heavy training.

94
00:08:15.708 --> 00:08:19.250
What about you and your fake goods?
All going smoothly there?

95
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:21.166
You don't filter your words. do you?

96
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.583
I don't sell fake stuff. Sarah.

97
00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:26.791
All my stuff is original but affordable.

98
00:08:26.875 --> 00:08:30.416
So it's not only the rich
that can afford that kinda stuff.

99
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.666
Is there anything you want?
I have everything.

100
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.208
Don't worry. just tell me
and I'll find it for you.

101
00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:36.666
So you could see it for yourself.

102
00:09:03.083 --> 00:09:04.416
How's your father in Bandung?

103
00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:22.416
You're going right back
to Jakarta after this?

104
00:09:27.583 --> 00:09:29.666
Won't it hurt your wallet.
going back and forth here?

105
00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:33.500
We can look for money. Dad.

106
00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:34.875
It's easy.

107
00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:37.416
I miss you.

108
00:09:48.416 --> 00:09:51.291
I just don't want to be a burden to you.

109
00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:55.375
The older you get.
the more needs you have to meet.

110
00:09:56.416 --> 00:09:58.833
If you keep coming every week

111
00:09:58.916 --> 00:10:01.666
for the next 18 years.
does that make sense?

112
00:10:02.916 --> 00:10:05.208
You told me that you were framed.

113
00:10:07.916 --> 00:10:09.625
Where are your friends now?

114
00:10:09.708 --> 00:10:12.125
They live a nice life.
going to different parties every day

115
00:10:12.208 --> 00:10:14.041
with hundreds of billions in their hands.

116
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:19.375
If one day I see one of your friends.
Uncle Retno. Uncle Rudi.

117
00:10:19.458 --> 00:10:22.250
if I ever see them. I will…

118
00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:23.875
What will you do then?

119
00:10:32.416 --> 00:10:34.041
There will be no end.

120
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.125
So. this is it?

121
00:10:39.791 --> 00:10:44.666
There's absolutely nothing more we can do
to get another appeal?

122
00:10:57.375 --> 00:10:59.750
I have a lawyer friend.

123
00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:02.208
He said he could help.

124
00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:05.583
But they're asking for two billion

125
00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.916
to re-open the case.

126
00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:18.666
Two billion?

127
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.166
The more I think about it.
the less I know what to do.

128
00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:27.000
I'm stuck.

129
00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:37.333
What is it?

130
00:11:40.791 --> 00:11:43.500
You know how much Dini paid us. right?

131
00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:46.250
50 million?

132
00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:49.166
Here. your Widajat painting

133
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.625
was bought for 900 million at auction.

134
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.125
That means Dini got
a huge profit from your work.

135
00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:58.041
You have forged the work of six maestros.

136
00:11:58.125 --> 00:12:01.916
and none of the buyers knew
that those were fake paintings.

137
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.166
What if we re-negotiate
the price for our next project?

138
00:12:06.541 --> 00:12:08.041
Ask her for a more fair price.

139
00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:11.500
Three paintings would be enough.

140
00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:14.541
And we could help your father out.

141
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.583
-Three?
-Yes. three.

142
00:12:23.916 --> 00:12:24.875
Take notes.

143
00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.208
As we should.

144
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:27.250
Nice.

145
00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.000
Lee Man Fong.

146
00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.208
-Hold on.
-Jeihan.

147
00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:34.916
Sunaryo.

148
00:12:35.708 --> 00:12:36.708
Suharmanto.

149
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:39.000
-Supriyadi.
-I don't know any of them. Piko.

150
00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:41.416
-Come on!
-Pick the more famous ones.

151
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.916
-Just anyone!
-All right. Raden Saleh!

152
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.708
-Raden Saleh?
-Why not?

153
00:12:45.791 --> 00:12:47.500
Him. I know!

154
00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:50.541
Okay. I'll gather the data now.

155
00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:03.750
Yes.

156
00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:05.541
Reporting. sir.

157
00:13:05.625 --> 00:13:09.583
A second report on the painting forgery
case just came in this afternoon.

158
00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.208
Whose painting was the first one?

159
00:13:13.291 --> 00:13:16.083
Affandi. The second one
was a Widajat painting.

160
00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:19.375
Have you gotten feedback
from the National Gallery?

161
00:13:19.458 --> 00:13:20.500
Not yet.

162
00:13:20.583 --> 00:13:23.500
They would need to invite
an investigator from Belgium

163
00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:26.541
to see whether the painting is forged.

164
00:13:27.083 --> 00:13:27.916
And?

165
00:13:28.916 --> 00:13:30.208
They don't have the budget for it.

166
00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:34.458
Then we can't turn this into a case.

167
00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:37.416
And it's not our job
to investigate fake paintings.

168
00:13:58.416 --> 00:13:59.416
What?

169
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.333
My father is asleep.

170
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.208
You joining the race tonight?

171
00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:08.125
I'm sleepy.

172
00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:09.208
Lame.

173
00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:13.000
By the way. tell your father

174
00:14:13.083 --> 00:14:15.208
to pay the rent on time next month.

175
00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:16.791
All right.

176
00:14:17.666 --> 00:14:21.041
-How am I going to get in?
-Just come in. Quietly.

177
00:14:22.458 --> 00:14:23.458
Hurry.

178
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:27.250
Don't make a noise.

179
00:14:29.458 --> 00:14:32.125
-Hurry up! You're so slow!
-All right!

180
00:14:53.041 --> 00:14:57.166
Won't you catch a cold
if you go home by motorbike every day?

181
00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.833
-If I were you. I wouldn't…
-Let it go. Grandma.

182
00:14:59.916 --> 00:15:01.750
Are we going to talk about this every day?

183
00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:05.791
What kind of life will you lead
if you end up with a painter?

184
00:15:24.666 --> 00:15:26.291
I apologize

185
00:15:27.041 --> 00:15:30.125
for making you

186
00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:32.458
take responsibility for all this.

187
00:15:33.875 --> 00:15:36.000
I just wanted to say

188
00:15:36.083 --> 00:15:40.541
that we might only have
a year left in this residence.

189
00:15:42.333 --> 00:15:45.500
Yes. Grandma. I'll find a way.

190
00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:26.250
Go!

191
00:16:33.291 --> 00:16:34.750
All good?

192
00:16:34.833 --> 00:16:36.500
Hey. wanna bet more?

193
00:16:37.208 --> 00:16:38.875
He's gonna win. Tuktuk.

194
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.208
Come on.

195
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.583
You scared?

196
00:16:45.666 --> 00:16:46.666
Bet more.

197
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.333
Just go all in. He's winning.

198
00:16:58.916 --> 00:17:00.125
How much is it?

199
00:17:00.208 --> 00:17:01.625
-Three million.
-You sure?

200
00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:02.916
Piss off.

201
00:17:07.583 --> 00:17:09.083
Gofar topped up for three million.

202
00:17:15.708 --> 00:17:18.708
-Gofar. what's happening?
-What?

203
00:17:19.416 --> 00:17:20.916
-What is it?
<i>-The clutch is busted.</i>

204
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.375
Shit. seriously?

205
00:17:25.666 --> 00:17:26.791
Fuck!

206
00:17:27.708 --> 00:17:28.958
What's wrong?

207
00:17:47.291 --> 00:17:48.250
What happened?

208
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.416
The clutch got busted.

209
00:17:58.083 --> 00:17:59.291
Might be the piston.

210
00:17:59.375 --> 00:18:00.625
-Maybe.
-I checked it earlier.

211
00:18:02.291 --> 00:18:04.208
Let's find a replacement in Mangga Besar.

212
00:18:06.791 --> 00:18:08.500
-That's the problem.
-What?

213
00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:13.875
I bet our last three million…

214
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.875
Dad's going to kill us.

215
00:18:27.666 --> 00:18:29.958
If we keep getting ripped off like this.

216
00:18:30.041 --> 00:18:32.458
when are we going to open our own garage?

217
00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:50.916
Before you give us another job.

218
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.500
I just want to say

219
00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:55.000
that we don't just need the money.

220
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.500
but we want a fair share.

221
00:19:01.666 --> 00:19:02.958
Come with me.

222
00:19:08.416 --> 00:19:10.291
-Hendra Gunawan?
-What?

223
00:19:10.375 --> 00:19:12.125
-Hendra Gunawan?
-No.

224
00:19:19.875 --> 00:19:21.416
I know.

225
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.416
Another Sudjojono?

226
00:19:28.208 --> 00:19:29.208
Raden Saleh.

227
00:19:38.333 --> 00:19:39.666
Which series?

228
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.000
<i>Portrait of the Sultans and VOC Officials</i>
or <i>The Horseman?</i>

229
00:19:43.083 --> 00:19:44.625
Neither.

230
00:19:45.541 --> 00:19:48.791
But those series' bodywork
is easier to forge

231
00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:52.333
because both series are difficult to trace
and have very messy documentation.

232
00:19:52.416 --> 00:19:53.916
<i>The Arrest of Prince Diponegoro.</i>

233
00:19:54.625 --> 00:19:55.541
What do you think?

234
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.958
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

235
00:20:02.791 --> 00:20:04.708
You're insane. Let's go.

236
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.250
-We have a huge deal.
-We'll end up in jail.

237
00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.791
This isn't a forgery. It's a replication.

238
00:20:11.875 --> 00:20:14.916
Yes. As detailed
and identical as possible.

239
00:20:16.583 --> 00:20:17.875
-Ucup.
-How much?

240
00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:18.833
Ucup!

241
00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:23.208
One billion in a month's time.
Fair enough?

242
00:20:24.708 --> 00:20:27.708
Two billion. Take it or leave it.

243
00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:56.916
This isn't just a forgery.

244
00:20:57.625 --> 00:20:59.041
This is making…

245
00:20:59.125 --> 00:21:00.416
What did Dini say?

246
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.291
As detailed and identical as possible.

247
00:21:02.375 --> 00:21:03.333
That.

248
00:21:04.583 --> 00:21:07.208
But. if we succeed.

249
00:21:07.291 --> 00:21:09.333
the money will solve your problem
right away.

250
00:21:11.541 --> 00:21:13.708
<i>The Arrest of Prince Diponegoro</i>

251
00:21:13.791 --> 00:21:15.208
isn't just a painting.

252
00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:22.416
<i>More than its high complexity</i>
<i>of color and technique.</i>

253
00:21:24.125 --> 00:21:26.916
<i>this painting also holds a wide range</i>
<i>of emotions and symbolism.</i>

254
00:21:29.208 --> 00:21:30.625
<i>First.</i>

255
00:21:30.708 --> 00:21:32.791
<i>the event is depicted in</i>

256
00:21:34.208 --> 00:21:35.250
<i>a vague setting.</i>

257
00:21:35.791 --> 00:21:37.125
<i>It's either morning or afternoon.</i>

258
00:21:38.791 --> 00:21:42.333
<i>Raden Saleh's protest</i>
<i>against this fraudulent arrest</i>

259
00:21:42.416 --> 00:21:45.208
<i>can be seen from his depiction</i>
<i>of the Dutch as dwarfs.</i>

260
00:21:45.916 --> 00:21:49.333
<i>On the other hand.</i>
<i>take a closer look at Diponegoro.</i>

261
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.500
<i>He made him look very gallant.</i>

262
00:21:51.583 --> 00:21:54.791
<i>The gesture seems as if</i>
<i>he's challenging his captors.</i>

263
00:22:03.708 --> 00:22:06.041
This is the maestro's work.

264
00:22:06.125 --> 00:22:08.958
<i>This painting is such</i>
<i>a big deal for Indonesia.</i>

265
00:22:10.125 --> 00:22:14.083
<i>Not only because Raden Saleh</i>
<i>is our first modern art symbol.</i>

266
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:19.625
<i>but also because this painting</i>
<i>is a symbol of resistance.</i>

267
00:22:39.125 --> 00:22:40.000
But…

268
00:22:43.333 --> 00:22:46.375
But why is Dini asking us to make this?

269
00:22:47.625 --> 00:22:50.250
Gosh. enough already.

270
00:22:50.333 --> 00:22:52.416
Stop overthinking.

271
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.416
I'll bring you the last restoration data
from Germany 2012 tomorrow. okay?

272
00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.625
We'll also look for the canvas.

273
00:23:03.083 --> 00:23:04.458
-See you. Man.
-Take care.

274
00:23:25.666 --> 00:23:26.916
Ouch!

275
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.458
Here's the data.

276
00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:39.333
-Three!
-Your girl is even cooler now.

277
00:23:40.083 --> 00:23:42.000
-You scared?
-I am.

278
00:23:42.083 --> 00:23:43.041
Of course you are.

279
00:23:46.916 --> 00:23:48.125
Where did you get these?

280
00:23:48.208 --> 00:23:50.041
Well…

281
00:23:50.583 --> 00:23:52.750
Their servers are easy to break into.

282
00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:54.416
So I just took everything.

283
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.541
Is that enough?

284
00:23:56.208 --> 00:23:57.500
These should do.

285
00:23:57.583 --> 00:23:59.000
There's so much.

286
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.416
You're awesome.

287
00:24:04.875 --> 00:24:05.875
Three!

288
00:24:07.708 --> 00:24:09.125
All right. I should go.

289
00:24:09.208 --> 00:24:10.083
Okay.

290
00:24:14.916 --> 00:24:16.083
<i>I think</i>

291
00:24:16.166 --> 00:24:20.000
I won't be able to see you
for the next week or two.

292
00:24:20.083 --> 00:24:21.250
Really?

293
00:24:21.333 --> 00:24:23.458
Haven't you been gone for like a week?

294
00:24:24.916 --> 00:24:26.708
I'm doing my final project.

295
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.875
You told me to. remember?

296
00:24:30.708 --> 00:24:33.541
Also. my lecturer can't shut up
and keeps asking about my progress.

297
00:24:37.416 --> 00:24:41.208
Not even going out for a bite

298
00:24:41.291 --> 00:24:44.666
or bringing you a meal?

299
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.500
I'm just trying to focus
and eliminate distractions. that's all.

300
00:24:54.666 --> 00:24:55.916
Distractions?

301
00:24:56.666 --> 00:24:58.833
-You mean I'm a distraction?
-No.

302
00:24:59.875 --> 00:25:02.625
So. when you said I was your muse.
it was just a lie?

303
00:25:02.708 --> 00:25:04.791
-Yes. no.
-Yes or no?

304
00:25:04.875 --> 00:25:06.250
-What do you mean?
-Yes. No.

305
00:25:06.333 --> 00:25:07.541
No…

306
00:25:08.333 --> 00:25:10.250
Yes. No. Yes.

307
00:25:10.333 --> 00:25:12.250
-Sarah…
-I don't get it.

308
00:25:18.833 --> 00:25:20.041
Sarah!

309
00:25:20.125 --> 00:25:22.958
-Sarah!
-All right. I get it.

310
00:25:23.041 --> 00:25:24.416
Let's just go.

311
00:25:28.333 --> 00:25:30.333
I need to start the project today.

312
00:25:36.791 --> 00:25:37.791
Okay.

313
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.083
I never asked you
to pick me up or take me home.

314
00:25:41.166 --> 00:25:42.916
I can get myself a cab.

315
00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:44.541
Sarah.

316
00:25:54.916 --> 00:25:56.458
Finish your final project.

317
00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.083
I understand.

318
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.166
Where do I put this. Piko?

319
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:20.625
-Over here.
-Okay.

320
00:28:23.791 --> 00:28:25.083
I'm going out.

321
00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:26.708
Where?

322
00:28:26.791 --> 00:28:29.916
To get some fresh air. My head's spinning
that we're so far from being finished.

323
00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:36.833
Ucup.

324
00:28:37.458 --> 00:28:39.083
How's the heater?

325
00:28:40.916 --> 00:28:42.500
-It's difficult.
-Come on. Man.

326
00:28:42.583 --> 00:28:44.458
-When are we going to wrap it up?
-All right.

327
00:28:44.541 --> 00:28:46.125
I'll continue right away.

328
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.375
Hold on.

329
00:28:54.458 --> 00:28:55.666
Gofar!

330
00:28:56.333 --> 00:28:57.791
Sorry.

331
00:28:59.791 --> 00:29:00.958
Can I ask you for a favor?

332
00:29:01.916 --> 00:29:04.208
What favor? What is it?

333
00:29:08.666 --> 00:29:10.375
It's here. That's fast.

334
00:29:10.458 --> 00:29:11.458
Take it.

335
00:29:11.541 --> 00:29:13.333
-Gofar!
-Yep.

336
00:29:13.416 --> 00:29:14.500
Your package is here.

337
00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:15.500
Nice.

338
00:29:15.583 --> 00:29:18.208
-So many.
-Let's unwrap them.

339
00:29:25.875 --> 00:29:27.333
It's safe.

340
00:29:27.416 --> 00:29:28.708
-Give it a try?
-Yes.

341
00:29:30.333 --> 00:29:32.791
-It's working.
-Good.

342
00:29:43.875 --> 00:29:44.916
Smart!

343
00:29:47.666 --> 00:29:48.666
Good. right?

344
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:00.541
Sir!

345
00:31:05.916 --> 00:31:07.666
-Ucup!
-What?

346
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:09.625
-Turn it off. it's done!
-It is?

347
00:31:32.958 --> 00:31:35.708
You're a genius. Pik!

348
00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:38.791
Good job!

349
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.958
-It's awesome!
-What are you guys doing?

350
00:31:49.666 --> 00:31:52.666
So. I'm just a friend
for you to have a meal with?

351
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:56.083
For you. dating is only about
picking me up and taking me home?

352
00:31:57.333 --> 00:31:59.625
Are you my boyfriend or my driver?

353
00:31:59.708 --> 00:32:02.083
Who's your girlfriend? Me or Ucup?

354
00:32:03.125 --> 00:32:05.166
A moment. please! I'm talking to Piko!

355
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.625
-Sar. I'm…
-Are you asking me for a fight?

356
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.958
Two billion. Sarah.

357
00:32:09.708 --> 00:32:11.291
I need two billion

358
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.416
to take my father's case
for an appeal to the Supreme Court.

359
00:32:15.208 --> 00:32:16.291
The one helping me

360
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.708
is Ucup.

361
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.583
Ucup gave me this job
to forge Raden Saleh's painting.

362
00:32:21.666 --> 00:32:24.833
This is the only thing I could do
to get that much money.

363
00:32:24.916 --> 00:32:26.083
You happy now?

364
00:32:27.708 --> 00:32:29.916
Why did you never tell me this?

365
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.291
What for?

366
00:32:32.125 --> 00:32:33.083
What for. Sarah?

367
00:32:34.083 --> 00:32:35.416
You have National Sports Week.

368
00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.250
And you must pass

369
00:32:38.875 --> 00:32:40.458
or they will withdraw your scholarship.

370
00:32:41.208 --> 00:32:43.500
In the end. this will just add
one more thing for you to worry about.

371
00:32:43.583 --> 00:32:44.708
What good would it do?

372
00:32:46.541 --> 00:32:48.208
I'm not giving you any more burdens.

373
00:32:49.708 --> 00:32:51.666
I'm sorry. Piko.

374
00:32:54.041 --> 00:32:55.166
I'm sorry too.

375
00:33:03.958 --> 00:33:06.666
I don't mean to disturb you.

376
00:33:07.333 --> 00:33:10.916
The transaction with Dini is in an hour.
so we should go now.

377
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.916
I'm coming with you.

378
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:15.333
I said I'm coming.

379
00:33:19.125 --> 00:33:20.333
Let's go.

380
00:33:25.916 --> 00:33:27.375
Why is she bringing a party?

381
00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:31.500
Hey.

382
00:33:32.041 --> 00:33:33.291
This feels scary.

383
00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:56.583
Piko. Ucup.

384
00:33:57.083 --> 00:33:57.875
Hey.

385
00:33:59.041 --> 00:34:00.208
Who's that?

386
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:01.541
Don't worry.

387
00:34:01.625 --> 00:34:02.833
She's my artisan.

388
00:34:02.916 --> 00:34:05.041
She's been with me
since the first project.

389
00:34:07.583 --> 00:34:11.750
You're young. but you act all high
by using an artisan.

390
00:34:11.833 --> 00:34:12.875
Is this it?

391
00:34:20.791 --> 00:34:22.791
I tried making this

392
00:34:22.875 --> 00:34:24.375
as detailed and identical as possible.

393
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.958
Even to the canvas choice.
as you can see for yourself.

394
00:34:33.375 --> 00:34:36.000
But what's on this surface

395
00:34:36.083 --> 00:34:38.708
was based on the restoration data of 2012.

396
00:34:39.666 --> 00:34:42.583
The rest and its condition today

397
00:34:42.666 --> 00:34:44.416
we have no record of it.

398
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.875
Mr. Permadi?

399
00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:23.500
Very exceptional.

400
00:35:24.416 --> 00:35:26.250
It's like looking

401
00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:30.750
right into the painting I had
in my old office.

402
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.000
You did great.

403
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.250
Are you…

404
00:35:37.041 --> 00:35:38.541
Piko Subiakto?

405
00:35:40.708 --> 00:35:42.208
That would be me.

406
00:35:43.125 --> 00:35:46.666
Here's 45 ETH.

407
00:35:47.958 --> 00:35:48.791
Two billion.

408
00:35:50.125 --> 00:35:51.166
-Yes.
-Okay?

409
00:35:56.041 --> 00:35:57.208
Wait.

410
00:35:58.958 --> 00:36:02.750
I have a more interesting offer.

411
00:36:07.625 --> 00:36:11.125
I'll add 315 ETH more.

412
00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:15.958
That means 17 billion in total.

413
00:36:16.041 --> 00:36:18.625
If you can swap this painting

414
00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:22.708
with the original one in my office.

415
00:36:24.416 --> 00:36:28.208
Wait. you mean the one
in the presidential palace?

416
00:36:29.458 --> 00:36:32.875
Two billion is nothing
compared to 17 billion.

417
00:36:34.041 --> 00:36:35.083
But. sir.

418
00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:37.750
we are not thieves.

419
00:36:44.208 --> 00:36:49.375
When I make a plan.
it's always a mature plan.

420
00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:51.250
All you have to do is execute it.

421
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.750
Then. you can go with that money.

422
00:36:56.166 --> 00:36:57.541
Would anyone turn it down?

423
00:36:57.625 --> 00:36:58.583
She's right.

424
00:36:58.666 --> 00:37:00.333
We're not thieves.

425
00:37:01.333 --> 00:37:02.583
We're…

426
00:37:02.666 --> 00:37:05.000
just students looking for a side job.

427
00:37:06.333 --> 00:37:09.250
The two billion you promised us is enough.

428
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.791
Whatever you want to do with this painting
is none of my business.

429
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.625
I want my two billion.

430
00:37:22.208 --> 00:37:24.041
Don!

431
00:37:32.458 --> 00:37:33.833
Do you know who this is?

432
00:37:36.083 --> 00:37:37.833
Budiman Subiakto.

433
00:37:39.458 --> 00:37:41.500
Isn't this your father?

434
00:37:45.791 --> 00:37:48.291
I can make your father suffer more.

435
00:37:49.583 --> 00:37:50.875
To serve his time longer.

436
00:37:52.458 --> 00:37:56.375
Or make him fight and die there.

437
00:37:59.708 --> 00:38:02.000
You don't have a choice. Piko.

438
00:38:06.708 --> 00:38:08.708
Three weeks from now.

439
00:38:09.333 --> 00:38:12.958
there will be an annual exhibition

440
00:38:14.708 --> 00:38:18.541
of the presidential palace's collection
at the National Museum.

441
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:23.916
You'll have a chance to swap the painting
when it's being moved.

442
00:38:26.791 --> 00:38:29.583
There's 500 million rupiah there.

443
00:38:30.416 --> 00:38:31.625
Take it.

444
00:38:31.708 --> 00:38:35.000
You guys can use it as the funds
to start working

445
00:38:35.916 --> 00:38:37.083
and to look for a crew.

446
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:38.916
Let's go. Dini.

447
00:39:13.708 --> 00:39:14.666
<i>Ucup.</i>

448
00:39:15.416 --> 00:39:16.833
Dini's your acquaintance. right?

449
00:39:17.375 --> 00:39:20.041
So how could the ex-president be there?

450
00:39:20.125 --> 00:39:21.500
Why are you blaming me?

451
00:39:21.583 --> 00:39:22.791
You've been so angry all day.

452
00:39:22.875 --> 00:39:25.250
-How can I not be angry?
-Enough!

453
00:39:26.375 --> 00:39:30.000
We've fucked up and now we're trapped!

454
00:39:35.541 --> 00:39:36.875
Piko.

455
00:39:38.083 --> 00:39:40.958
You're not considering it. are you?

456
00:39:41.041 --> 00:39:43.041
Then. what should I do. Sarah?

457
00:39:44.125 --> 00:39:46.625
The one who's an ex-president is Permadi.

458
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.333
He's the one with the power.

459
00:39:49.416 --> 00:39:50.625
Us?

460
00:39:50.708 --> 00:39:52.500
What are we?

461
00:39:52.583 --> 00:39:54.625
Only normal citizens!

462
00:39:54.708 --> 00:39:57.416
We have nothing!

463
00:40:08.208 --> 00:40:09.208
Why?

464
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:13.916
If something happens to my dad.
what should I do?

465
00:40:14.791 --> 00:40:17.416
If what Permadi said really happens.

466
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.708
what should I do. Sarah?

467
00:40:27.583 --> 00:40:30.250
I don't know why Permadi
wants that painting.

468
00:40:36.625 --> 00:40:40.083
But. if I have to break down
our situation.

469
00:40:42.208 --> 00:40:43.583
there are two things to be considered.

470
00:40:50.583 --> 00:40:52.041
The pros and cons of all this.

471
00:40:55.375 --> 00:40:56.500
The first pro.

472
00:40:58.541 --> 00:41:01.291
Uncle Budiman's problem
will be cleared in no time.

473
00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:03.625
Two billion rupiah in one month.

474
00:41:03.708 --> 00:41:05.916
and he'll be safe from Permadi's threat.

475
00:41:09.375 --> 00:41:10.625
The second pro.

476
00:41:13.958 --> 00:41:15.291
How to sell the painting.

477
00:41:16.041 --> 00:41:17.375
There. the funds.

478
00:41:19.416 --> 00:41:20.958
It's right there in front of our eyes.

479
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.375
The third one.

480
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.500
If we succeed.

481
00:41:30.125 --> 00:41:32.541
we will have 15 billion left.

482
00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:36.916
15 billion.

483
00:41:38.291 --> 00:41:39.500
But. the cons…

484
00:41:43.583 --> 00:41:46.500
Well. we're not thieves.

485
00:41:48.208 --> 00:41:51.708
I'm not saying we can't.
but we don't have the experience.

486
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.083
And second.

487
00:41:55.458 --> 00:41:57.000
if we get caught.

488
00:42:00.583 --> 00:42:03.541
we will end up like your father.

489
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:15.833
The fourth pro.

490
00:42:21.083 --> 00:42:23.666
If we dare to do this.

491
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:28.500
our safety. my dad's life. and our lives

492
00:42:29.125 --> 00:42:33.125
will also be safe
from our mad ex-president's threats.

493
00:42:33.875 --> 00:42:34.750
But…

494
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.916
But. we don't have a choice.

495
00:42:40.083 --> 00:42:42.750
If we can perfectly execute this.

496
00:42:43.708 --> 00:42:45.666
maybe we can get away with it.

497
00:42:46.791 --> 00:42:48.583
Aren't you scared. Sarah?

498
00:42:50.708 --> 00:42:51.541
Ucup.

499
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.666
This isn't just about Piko's father.

500
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.458
It's also about our safety.

501
00:42:58.708 --> 00:43:01.708
Piko. you. me. we were all there.

502
00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:06.791
And the money.

503
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.250
The money can be used for my grandma.

504
00:43:11.291 --> 00:43:12.500
And us. Piko.

505
00:43:35.666 --> 00:43:38.708
Now. we need to break down
the plan given by Dini and Permadi.

506
00:43:41.416 --> 00:43:42.708
Here. look at this.

507
00:43:42.791 --> 00:43:46.250
Permadi only gave us
the logistics company's profile.

508
00:43:46.333 --> 00:43:47.625
While we need detailed information

509
00:43:47.708 --> 00:43:50.583
about the logistics company that
the palace has been using all this time.

510
00:44:04.708 --> 00:44:08.333
This logistics company has been using
the same route for the past 12 years.

511
00:44:09.958 --> 00:44:13.666
Give me time
to study all of Permadi's plans.

512
00:44:36.208 --> 00:44:37.625
We need to know

513
00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:39.666
the traffic conditions
at the time of delivery

514
00:44:41.208 --> 00:44:43.125
and find the safest point

515
00:44:44.291 --> 00:44:45.291
for the swap.

516
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.500
But.

517
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:57.375
we need a getaway driver.

518
00:44:57.458 --> 00:44:59.791
-And a mechanic who'll fulfill our needs.
-Piko.

519
00:45:01.583 --> 00:45:03.541
Pik. where are you going?

520
00:45:05.208 --> 00:45:06.125
I got an idea.

521
00:45:06.208 --> 00:45:10.708
You think taking a customer's car
to join a race

522
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:12.833
is a brilliant idea?

523
00:45:13.458 --> 00:45:14.541
You're both idiots.

524
00:45:14.625 --> 00:45:16.833
Even though you have different mothers.

525
00:45:16.916 --> 00:45:19.791
the way you both act
is identically stupid.

526
00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.416
Well. we have the same father.

527
00:45:23.208 --> 00:45:24.625
You dare talk back to me?!

528
00:45:24.708 --> 00:45:26.833
Dad. but this is BMW E30.

529
00:45:26.916 --> 00:45:29.750
-How could we get the money?
-That's right. It's too expensive.

530
00:45:29.833 --> 00:45:31.333
I don't care.

531
00:45:31.416 --> 00:45:32.875
-Uncle!
-The point is…

532
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.833
Oh. Piko.

533
00:45:36.791 --> 00:45:41.333
If you're here for rent. I'm sorry.

534
00:45:41.416 --> 00:45:42.833
I think I'll be late paying
this month's rent.

535
00:45:42.916 --> 00:45:44.958
It's because of these two brats.

536
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:49.333
We'll talk about the rent later.

537
00:45:49.416 --> 00:45:51.500
Right now. I need to talk to them both.

538
00:45:51.583 --> 00:45:53.166
Oh.

539
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:56.541
Hey. You two can't be happy just yet.

540
00:45:56.625 --> 00:45:59.208
Find the money to replace that engine.

541
00:45:59.291 --> 00:46:00.291
Okay?

542
00:46:05.583 --> 00:46:06.625
Hey.

543
00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:09.708
You need money?

544
00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:12.750
Follow me.

545
00:46:16.625 --> 00:46:17.541
So…

546
00:46:19.208 --> 00:46:20.916
each of us will get our own share.

547
00:46:21.708 --> 00:46:22.500
Three billion rupiah.

548
00:46:26.125 --> 00:46:28.250
Damn. We can build our own garage.

549
00:46:28.333 --> 00:46:30.541
But. to polish our plan.

550
00:46:30.625 --> 00:46:33.875
we still have to hack into
the painting delivery logistic system.

551
00:46:33.958 --> 00:46:35.458
The problem is.

552
00:46:36.208 --> 00:46:38.416
This company is insanely old school.

553
00:46:39.208 --> 00:46:41.083
Their database isn't even on the net.

554
00:46:47.708 --> 00:46:49.375
Yeah…

555
00:46:50.875 --> 00:46:52.541
If they still do it old school.

556
00:46:55.583 --> 00:46:57.333
then we'll do the same.

557
00:47:04.166 --> 00:47:05.208
Are you serious. Ucup?

558
00:47:18.333 --> 00:47:20.666
Twenty minutes from now.
pick us up at the safe zone.

559
00:47:21.208 --> 00:47:22.041
Got it.

560
00:47:36.583 --> 00:47:38.458
Are you sure we're using these?

561
00:47:38.541 --> 00:47:41.166
It's just Airsoft gel.

562
00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:43.208
This will be our alibi if we get caught.

563
00:47:43.291 --> 00:47:47.000
We will just look like
some naughty brats who broke in.

564
00:47:50.583 --> 00:47:52.125
-Gofar. sorry.
-Are you crazy?

565
00:47:52.208 --> 00:47:55.000
-That stings!
-Stop. You're not using this. okay?

566
00:48:03.958 --> 00:48:05.583
Hey. where's Gofar?

567
00:48:06.291 --> 00:48:07.291
Gofar?

568
00:48:08.166 --> 00:48:09.041
Where's Gofar?

569
00:48:09.916 --> 00:48:10.875
Hey.

570
00:48:43.041 --> 00:48:44.791
What are you doing? There's no one here.

571
00:48:57.583 --> 00:48:59.208
-Ucup.
-What?

572
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:00.333
What are we looking for?

573
00:49:01.083 --> 00:49:03.625
The schedule or the staff list.

574
00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:06.291
Oh. yeah.

575
00:49:09.333 --> 00:49:10.708
Why are they taking so long?

576
00:49:10.791 --> 00:49:12.208
How should I know?

577
00:49:21.791 --> 00:49:22.708
Ucup. is this the right one?

578
00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:34.583
-There. thief!
-Hey!

579
00:49:34.666 --> 00:49:36.666
-There's a thief!
-We're busted!

580
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.416
-Ucup! Run!
-Thief!

581
00:49:41.708 --> 00:49:42.625
Oh. yeah!

582
00:49:42.708 --> 00:49:45.166
-Thief!
-Wait for me. Sarah!

583
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:46.625
-Thief! Don't run!
-Sarah!

584
00:49:46.708 --> 00:49:50.083
Hey! Stop! Hey! Thief!

585
00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.666
Hey. thief! Stop!

586
00:50:02.958 --> 00:50:04.125
-Hey!
-Sarah!

587
00:50:09.583 --> 00:50:11.500
-What's your name?
-Faisal.

588
00:50:11.583 --> 00:50:13.208
You dare mess with me?

589
00:50:13.291 --> 00:50:15.125
Don't make me pull the trigger.

590
00:50:15.208 --> 00:50:16.125
Fuck. I pulled it.

591
00:50:18.083 --> 00:50:19.333
A toy!

592
00:50:20.208 --> 00:50:21.625
Come here.

593
00:50:22.125 --> 00:50:22.958
Hey!

594
00:50:26.791 --> 00:50:27.583
Come on!

595
00:50:31.958 --> 00:50:33.958
-Gofar!
-Don't look back.

596
00:50:37.666 --> 00:50:38.750
Gofar!

597
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.333
Hey! Stop right there!

598
00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:54.166
PT. SENO PATI EXPRESS ADMINISTRATION

599
00:50:57.208 --> 00:50:58.958
We need one more person. Ucup.

600
00:50:59.791 --> 00:51:02.750
We need someone with privilege.

601
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.125
who has some leverage.

602
00:51:05.208 --> 00:51:08.708
and who at least has
the resources to make changes.

603
00:51:08.791 --> 00:51:10.750
-Am I right?
-Someone who makes more sense.

604
00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.125
More human.

605
00:51:17.208 --> 00:51:18.833
Smarter.

606
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.708
A rich kid with criminal sense.

607
00:51:25.333 --> 00:51:27.208
And who doesn't need money.

608
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:28.375
Well.

609
00:51:28.458 --> 00:51:31.041
Maybe someone who just wants
a thriller-seeking adventure.

610
00:51:31.708 --> 00:51:32.958
Like Batman?

611
00:51:34.125 --> 00:51:35.291
A night owl?

612
00:51:35.375 --> 00:51:36.416
No.

613
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.166
Crazy rich.

614
00:51:41.708 --> 00:51:42.833
Okay.

615
00:51:42.916 --> 00:51:45.750
I have the perfect candidate.

616
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:05.375
Hit.

617
00:52:10.916 --> 00:52:13.708
You marked the cards. didn't you?

618
00:52:13.791 --> 00:52:16.666
It's impossible to win 12 times in a row.

619
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:18.500
If you can prove that I'm cheating.

620
00:52:18.583 --> 00:52:20.333
take all the money in my bag.

621
00:52:23.791 --> 00:52:25.333
No one wants to go on?

622
00:52:27.916 --> 00:52:28.958
What about this?

623
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.416
Is it not enough?

624
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:35.333
Are you new here?

625
00:52:36.083 --> 00:52:37.875
I'm not in the mood
to play with a new guy.

626
00:52:39.375 --> 00:52:42.500
Okay. How about this?

627
00:52:44.708 --> 00:52:45.666
30 million.

628
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.208
-Sit. Please sit.
-Okay.

629
00:52:53.416 --> 00:52:54.250
Hit.

630
00:52:56.666 --> 00:52:57.500
Yes.

631
00:52:58.208 --> 00:52:59.166
You're scared?

632
00:53:04.708 --> 00:53:06.083
You're too bold.

633
00:53:07.041 --> 00:53:09.500
I told you. she'll play you.

634
00:53:14.916 --> 00:53:16.458
I like how bold you are.

635
00:53:21.291 --> 00:53:22.708
<i>I understand your play style.</i>

636
00:53:23.916 --> 00:53:26.208
<i>You let your opponent win first.</i>

637
00:53:27.291 --> 00:53:28.916
<i>so they will raise the bet.</i>

638
00:53:29.708 --> 00:53:32.708
<i>Then. you'll finish them</i>
<i>when they go all in.</i>

639
00:53:34.708 --> 00:53:35.875
You're crazy.

640
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.000
You got money to burn?

641
00:53:39.083 --> 00:53:40.416
What if I say yes?

642
00:53:44.208 --> 00:53:45.208
All in.

643
00:53:45.916 --> 00:53:48.291
Jeep Cherokee 1994. limited edition.

644
00:53:51.375 --> 00:53:53.041
I don't understand your motivation.

645
00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:58.083
But if you're asking me on a date
by wasting money like this…

646
00:54:04.583 --> 00:54:05.750
Okay.

647
00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.541
What if I give you an adventure
worth 2.5 billion?

648
00:54:13.208 --> 00:54:15.458
Can you still say that
it's not your play style?

649
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:42.916
So?

650
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:45.875
Are you in?

651
00:54:48.208 --> 00:54:49.333
This is all for me. right?

652
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.333
Okay.

653
00:55:04.208 --> 00:55:06.125
Gofar.

654
00:55:06.208 --> 00:55:08.750
-Gofar. look.
-What is it?

655
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.125
Seriously?

656
00:55:14.208 --> 00:55:15.166
Hey.

657
00:55:19.791 --> 00:55:22.041
You both are also here. Hi!

658
00:55:22.125 --> 00:55:23.333
What is it?

659
00:55:23.416 --> 00:55:24.250
Let's go.

660
00:55:24.958 --> 00:55:26.041
Come in.

661
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.708
-Guys. this is Fella.
-Wait.

662
00:55:30.791 --> 00:55:32.541
-You invited her?
-Yeah.

663
00:55:32.625 --> 00:55:34.791
-To our team?
-Yeah. What about it?

664
00:55:34.875 --> 00:55:37.333
You're mad. No. We both quit.

665
00:55:37.416 --> 00:55:39.916
Why would I be on the same team
with some bookie? I'd be crazy.

666
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.125
Sorry. Piko. I'm out.

667
00:55:41.916 --> 00:55:42.875
What?

668
00:55:42.958 --> 00:55:45.916
This girl has swindled both me
and Gofar so many times.

669
00:55:47.208 --> 00:55:49.708
You don't want anything
to do with some bookie.

670
00:55:49.791 --> 00:55:52.666
or you're afraid of always losing to one?

671
00:55:53.708 --> 00:55:56.666
-If you weren't a girl. you'd be dead.
-Wow. chill.

672
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:58.583
Hey. What's your deal with girls?

673
00:55:58.666 --> 00:55:59.833
I'm a girl too.

674
00:55:59.916 --> 00:56:02.333
I could kick both of your asses here
if I wanted to.

675
00:56:02.416 --> 00:56:03.833
Hey. stop.

676
00:56:05.583 --> 00:56:08.208
We're here for the same reason.

677
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:09.833
Money.

678
00:56:10.791 --> 00:56:12.416
So you're in or not?

679
00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:13.666
Enough.

680
00:56:14.291 --> 00:56:16.916
Leave your personal matters
back on the race field.

681
00:56:38.083 --> 00:56:39.041
Sita.

682
00:56:40.958 --> 00:56:43.083
We have a duty to guard a national asset.

683
00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:45.750
No one wants to take this job.
so I have to give this to you.

684
00:56:45.833 --> 00:56:48.208
You'll be coming with my team. okay?

685
00:56:48.291 --> 00:56:50.291
<i>The Arrest of Prince Diponegoro</i>
by Raden Saleh?

686
00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:55.416
<i>And so…</i>

687
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.416
Our chance to swap the paintings
is only at the time of delivery.

688
00:57:03.416 --> 00:57:05.375
Actually. your plan is okay.

689
00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:09.291
But. there are still so many
missing details.

690
00:57:09.375 --> 00:57:11.416
Loopholes here and there.

691
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:16.125
Now. how are you guys
going to get the delivery schedule

692
00:57:16.208 --> 00:57:18.166
if they still record it manually?

693
00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:22.208
Don't tell me that you've been stealthily
breaking in to get the data?

694
00:57:29.583 --> 00:57:31.708
Gofar! Where's Tuktuk?

695
00:57:31.791 --> 00:57:33.125
I don't know!

696
00:57:33.208 --> 00:57:35.000
Stop running! Hey!

697
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:37.875
Hey! Stop!

698
00:57:37.958 --> 00:57:40.208
<i>Well. we were inspired by a game.</i>

699
00:57:43.708 --> 00:57:44.708
Well…

700
00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:47.500
And?

701
00:57:49.583 --> 00:57:50.625
You got an idea?

702
00:57:55.375 --> 00:57:56.500
We

703
00:57:56.583 --> 00:58:00.333
need two people to infiltrate
this company as staff.

704
00:58:01.208 --> 00:58:03.000
Not bribing the driver.

705
00:58:03.083 --> 00:58:05.291
You don't want to leave
any traces. do you?

706
00:58:10.458 --> 00:58:11.458
That's why…

707
00:58:13.083 --> 00:58:14.208
we need you.

708
00:58:17.166 --> 00:58:21.250
We'll make a diploma for Gofar and Tuktuk.
so they can get a job there.

709
00:58:21.333 --> 00:58:23.250
-Us?
-Of course.

710
00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.708
Who else?

711
00:58:24.791 --> 00:58:27.041
INDONESIA JAYA UNIVERSITY DIPLOMA

712
00:58:33.875 --> 00:58:35.125
Okay.

713
00:58:35.208 --> 00:58:39.375
Then. do we have to
get a job there ourselves?

714
00:58:39.458 --> 00:58:41.541
Of course not. stupid.

715
00:58:42.583 --> 00:58:45.166
My mom's chief of staff
will take care of you two.

716
00:58:57.791 --> 00:58:58.708
RELIABLE FAST SHIPPING

717

Come in. Tuktuk!

718
00:59:00.083 --> 00:59:01.166
To the right.

719
00:59:02.791 --> 00:59:04.041
To the right. Stop!

720
00:59:14.666 --> 00:59:16.916
-That one has this.
-How is it?

721
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.416
-Where is it?
-Is this it?

722
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:20.416
-Yeah.
-It looks similar.

723
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:21.416
Easy.

724
00:59:29.208 --> 00:59:30.041
Piko.

725
00:59:32.333 --> 00:59:33.166
Here.

726
01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:27.041
Can you handle that?

727
01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:28.541
Of course. It's me.

728
01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:31.208
There. You can check it.

729
01:00:31.291 --> 01:00:33.583
There's a red button. Press it.

730
01:00:41.666 --> 01:00:42.750
I'm great. right?

731
01:00:44.166 --> 01:00:45.583
I'm even better than Carhood.

732
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:49.333
I'll be resting.

733
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:50.916
I need to build the mood.

734
01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.416
Okay.

735
01:01:05.958 --> 01:01:08.250
I didn't take my leave last year.

736
01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:11.166
And I can't take it this year either.

737
01:01:11.666 --> 01:01:14.458
I even promised my children a trip.

738
01:01:17.791 --> 01:01:20.208
Well. well. well.

739
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.500
That's the opposite for me.

740
01:01:24.583 --> 01:01:28.041
I just won a six-person vacation to Bali.

741
01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:31.416
I'm new here.

742
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:32.875
I can't take any leave yet.

743
01:01:33.583 --> 01:01:35.208
When is the date of the vacation?

744
01:01:36.666 --> 01:01:38.000
January 22nd.

745
01:01:40.833 --> 01:01:42.500
Do you want it?

746
01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.708
I'll take care of it.

747
01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:49.541
Let me play this for you. okay?

748
01:01:54.416 --> 01:01:55.750
Hey. Ucup.

749
01:01:55.833 --> 01:01:57.708
Book tickets to Bali for six people.

750
01:01:57.791 --> 01:01:59.500
On behalf of Yudi Sugandi.

751
01:02:01.416 --> 01:02:02.291
Yes.

752
01:02:09.375 --> 01:02:10.333
How is it going?

753
01:02:10.416 --> 01:02:12.875
Do you know who will deliver the painting?

754
01:02:13.541 --> 01:02:15.041
Here. The assignment letter.

755
01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:17.666
Me and Gofar.

756
01:02:19.583 --> 01:02:21.833
Why didn't you just tell us in chat?

757
01:02:21.916 --> 01:02:23.375
-Yeah.
-So that there's tension.

758
01:02:23.458 --> 01:02:24.916
Just like all those heist movies.

759
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.333
Gofar. Tuktuk. follow me.
I want to show you guys something.

760
01:02:28.416 --> 01:02:30.250
-What?
-Come here.

761
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:39.916
It's similar.

762
01:02:41.583 --> 01:02:42.916
-You're crazy. Piko.
-Mad.

763
01:02:43.416 --> 01:02:44.500
You're mad.

764
01:02:46.916 --> 01:02:48.708
It's great.

765
01:02:50.416 --> 01:02:51.791
What about the engine series?

766
01:02:53.583 --> 01:02:54.708
Can you really do that?

767
01:02:54.791 --> 01:02:56.416
Patience. Don't fucking rush me.

768
01:02:58.333 --> 01:03:00.166
-You good?
-Patience.

769
01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:04.833
-Pull me out.
-Okay.

770
01:03:16.583 --> 01:03:17.875
Don't you think

771
01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:21.916
asking Gofar to copy the machine series
is too much?

772
01:03:24.625 --> 01:03:26.625
I'm just fixing the loopholes
in your plan.

773
01:03:29.208 --> 01:03:30.250
Really?

774
01:03:33.083 --> 01:03:37.416
I thought you were just a thrill-seeker
who was secretly a narcissist

775
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.500
and always wanted to be
the center of attention.

776
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.291
Turns out you're deceitful too.

777
01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:48.500
It's fun. isn't it?

778
01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:50.916
Looking through my digital history?

779
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.208
My social media accounts.
starting from<i> Steller. Blogspot…</i>

780
01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:57.250
What else?

781
01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.833
-Up to…
-Up to your secret Instagram account.

782
01:04:02.125 --> 01:04:04.500
A place for your rants
along with your subject pictures?

783
01:04:09.916 --> 01:04:12.791
So. all this time…

784
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.208
That's what you call a strategy. Fella.

785
01:04:20.208 --> 01:04:21.333
What about this tunnel?

786
01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:25.625
Is your strategy with this tunnel as good
as your strategy of flirting with me?

787
01:04:34.541 --> 01:04:36.083
Your house seems so quiet.

788
01:04:43.875 --> 01:04:46.000
Make sure you have enough rest.

789
01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:47.541
Okay.

790
01:04:48.291 --> 01:04:49.166
You too.

791
01:05:02.708 --> 01:05:04.583
-Are Mom and Dad home?
-Not yet. miss.

792
01:05:33.416 --> 01:05:35.500
This will be the route.

793
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.708
I want you to be on your guard.

794
01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:42.125
What could the threat be?

795
01:05:42.208 --> 01:05:44.458
Who would be crazy enough
to steal a painting?

796
01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:47.500
This delivery is almost without threat.

797
01:05:48.416 --> 01:05:49.583
But I want

798
01:05:50.333 --> 01:05:53.791
the escort to be just like it has been
the last two years.

799
01:05:53.875 --> 01:05:57.166
The escorting protocol was pioneered
by Ex-President Permadi.

800
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.708
Sir.

801
01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.541
We're coming. Ucup.

802
01:07:01.416 --> 01:07:02.875
Good morning. everyone.

803
01:07:45.208 --> 01:07:47.958
Guys. We're on standby.

804
01:07:49.333 --> 01:07:51.083
Relax. Calm down.

805
01:07:51.166 --> 01:07:52.833
<i>Everything is under control.</i>

806
01:07:53.666 --> 01:07:55.916
Three kilometers to the tunnel.

807
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:17.250
<i>10-8 National Gallery.</i>

808
01:08:17.333 --> 01:08:20.333

01:08:20.416 --> 01:08:22.708
<i>Hey. we've passed the monument.</i>

810
01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.583
Fella. Piko.

811
01:08:25.208 --> 01:08:26.833
<i>-Ready?</i>
-I'm in.

812
01:08:28.291 --> 01:08:29.166
Ready. Sarah?

813
01:09:03.625 --> 01:09:05.416
Hey. you're blocking the way. miss.

814
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.500
I'm sorry. sir. My car broke down.
I don't understand why.

815
01:09:08.583 --> 01:09:11.500
-Are you serious. miss?
-I apologize.

816
01:09:11.583 --> 01:09:13.708
I don't know why.
Suddenly smoke's coming out of my car.

817
01:09:13.791 --> 01:09:15.208
You're blocking the way. miss.

818
01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:17.750
I'm sorry. Everyone. This…

819
01:09:28.958 --> 01:09:30.708

820
01:09:44.291 --> 01:09:45.875
Keep the pace. guys.

Hey.

823
01:09:54.916 --> 01:09:56.750
Why are there two trucks?

824
01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.708
It's causing traffic to bank back
a long way back. miss.

825
01:10:00.791 --> 01:10:04.541
It's an electric car.
I don't understand how to fix it either.

826
01:10:04.625 --> 01:10:06.250
-Gosh!
-Look at the traffic. miss!

827
01:10:06.333 --> 01:10:08.500
Ucup. it's chaos here.
A lot of people are starting to help.

828
01:10:08.583 --> 01:10:09.958
Improvise. Fella.

829
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.333
My car broke down. sir. Sorry!
It broke down.

830
01:10:24.875 --> 01:10:28.000

<i>How much longer?</i>

835
01:10:43.791 --> 01:10:45.000
I'm almost at the point. Ucup.

836
01:11:02.708 --> 01:11:04.125
Gofar. Piko is behind us.

837
01:11:04.208 --> 01:11:05.208
Already?

838
01:11:05.291 --> 01:11:06.291
I can't see him.

839
01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:19.916
-We clear?
-Yeah.

840
01:11:22.791 --> 01:11:24.916

01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:50.083
Wait a minute. sir.

845
01:11:51.166 --> 01:11:53.166
Ucup. the police are approaching.
What should I do?

846
01:11:56.625 --> 01:11:59.250
Tuktuk. I'll move. okay?
I'll overtake the car in front.

847

-Piko. let's get away!

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:09.708
Hey. stop!

899
01:17:11.666 --> 01:17:13.083
Move!

900
01:17:28.166 --> 01:17:29.708
This is a safe place.

901
01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:31.375
Here.

902
01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:36.416
I won't say a word to your parents.

903
01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.458
-It'll be all right.
-Okay.

904
01:17:38.541 --> 01:17:41.000
I'll try to find more information outside.

905
01:17:41.083 --> 01:17:42.333
-Okay.
-Okay?

906
01:17:56.416 --> 01:17:58.250
I think we're safe here.

907
01:18:06.625 --> 01:18:08.083
Does he know anything?

908
01:18:10.958 --> 01:18:12.416
I may have told him.

909
01:18:13.166 --> 01:18:14.791
Are you out of your mind?

910
01:18:14.875 --> 01:18:18.000
-Do you want to get caught?
-I said we're safe!

911
01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:22.041
He's our only way of finding out
what's going on outside.

912
01:18:22.125 --> 01:18:23.625
He's got connections.

913
01:18:24.583 --> 01:18:26.041
Gito works for my mom.

914
01:18:26.125 --> 01:18:28.291
but I trust him more than her!

915
01:18:28.875 --> 01:18:29.875
Understand?

916
01:18:42.208 --> 01:18:43.458
So now what?

917
01:18:43.541 --> 01:18:44.583
About what?

918
01:18:44.666 --> 01:18:45.750
What's next?

919
01:18:45.833 --> 01:18:47.791
There is no next step!

920
01:18:48.416 --> 01:18:49.750
It's all fucked up!

921
01:18:53.666 --> 01:18:55.166
I don't know what to do.

922
01:19:07.958 --> 01:19:09.083
Why is there no info

923
01:19:09.166 --> 01:19:12.041
about a guard using
a civilian car in Permadi's plan?

924
01:19:37.333 --> 01:19:38.375
Fuck you!

925
01:19:39.958 --> 01:19:41.500
I should've never trusted you!

926
01:19:41.583 --> 01:19:43.166
I didn't know the cops
would be there either!

927
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:44.416
You asshole!

928
01:19:45.458 --> 01:19:46.916
Damn it!

929
01:19:50.791 --> 01:19:52.708
<i>What about the others?</i>

930
01:19:57.083 --> 01:20:00.125
I don't want Piko.
of all people. to get caught.

931
01:20:00.208 --> 01:20:01.333
Why him?

932
01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.500
His mom died when he was a kid.

933
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:08.500
And his father…

934
01:20:10.583 --> 01:20:14.250
He went to jail for robbery
a few years ago.

935
01:20:18.875 --> 01:20:21.333
And here I thought I had it rough.

936
01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:26.833
Mine are nothing compared to his problems.

937
01:20:31.208 --> 01:20:34.125
-It's all my fault. Fella.
-No. it's not.

938
01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:36.250
It's not all your fault.

939
01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:40.625
If the cops hadn't arrived…

940
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:44.500
Who's that?

941
01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:00.916
Sarah.

942
01:21:03.416 --> 01:21:05.291
Don't you dare leave me again!

943
01:21:05.375 --> 01:21:07.375
Have I ever left you?

944
01:21:07.458 --> 01:21:09.083
I wasn't leaving you. Sarah!

945
01:21:09.166 --> 01:21:11.958
I was telling you to run!
I wasn't expecting the cops!

946
01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:17.333
Hey.

947
01:21:22.875 --> 01:21:24.750
Tuktuk got caught.

948
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.375
What do we do now?

949
01:21:38.583 --> 01:21:39.916
Oh. God.

950
01:21:40.666 --> 01:21:42.416
We're fugitives now.

951
01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.166
What about my grandma?

952
01:21:46.416 --> 01:21:47.875
Oh. grandma.

953
01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:01.958
I'm worried for my dad's safety.

954
01:22:08.541 --> 01:22:10.458
<i>If you remain silent</i>

955
01:22:10.541 --> 01:22:12.500
and do not cooperate.

956
01:22:13.791 --> 01:22:15.166
I can't guarantee

957
01:22:15.666 --> 01:22:19.083
that I can help you ease your sentence.

958
01:22:27.166 --> 01:22:29.458
Who were the other two that
ran away from the truck?

959
01:22:46.958 --> 01:22:49.500
They caught a driver called Tuktuk.

960
01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:52.416
Your friend's car is now a crime scene.

961
01:23:08.375 --> 01:23:09.875
Do you know Yusuf Hamdan?

962
01:23:11.416 --> 01:23:12.375
Isn't he your friend?

963
01:23:12.458 --> 01:23:17.333
WANTED LIST

964
01:23:17.416 --> 01:23:20.375
<i>His cover has likely been blown.</i>

965
01:23:22.041 --> 01:23:23.250
You should be careful.

966
01:23:24.125 --> 01:23:26.791
-Okay.
-Call me if you need anything.

967
01:23:28.083 --> 01:23:29.583
Thank you.

968
01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:34.875
Is the phone secured?

969
01:23:38.708 --> 01:23:39.916
Piko is safe.

970
01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:43.708
But they got Tuktuk.

971
01:23:47.708 --> 01:23:51.041
Gito said the cops might know who you are.

972
01:23:51.916 --> 01:23:53.250
Okay.

973
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:06.583
Excuse me.

974
01:24:08.583 --> 01:24:11.458
The National Gallery
is asking about the painting.

975
01:24:11.541 --> 01:24:15.916
The HQ wants to speed this up
so they can hold the exhibition on time.

976
01:24:16.541 --> 01:24:18.083
It's a direct order from the palace.

977
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:41.708
The strange thing is.

978
01:24:41.791 --> 01:24:44.833
we got these paintings
from two similar trucks.

979
01:24:44.916 --> 01:24:46.791
Not only are they the same painting.

980
01:24:47.458 --> 01:24:51.458
but the two trucks were identical.
even down to their engine series number.

981
01:24:56.708 --> 01:24:59.208
Not just anyone
could pull off this robbery.

982
01:25:00.125 --> 01:25:05.000
They're capable enough to not only steal
but also switch the paintings.

983
01:25:05.083 --> 01:25:06.458
More importantly.

984
01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:10.291
we can't tell which one is real
and which is fake.

985
01:25:12.291 --> 01:25:15.833
The National Gallery suggests
calling the palace's curator.

986
01:25:15.916 --> 01:25:17.750
Well. send them a letter.

987
01:25:19.458 --> 01:25:21.333
Let them check this tomorrow.

988
01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:23.166
Yes. sir.

989
01:25:23.791 --> 01:25:24.916
Sita. come on.

990
01:25:32.333 --> 01:25:34.666
I want this room highly secured.

991
01:25:35.541 --> 01:25:37.708
This painting is worth
hundreds of millions.

992
01:25:37.791 --> 01:25:39.083
Yes. ma'am.

993
01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:04.625
Can I help you?

994
01:26:04.708 --> 01:26:06.625
I'd like to see Mr. Arman.

995
01:26:07.208 --> 01:26:08.458
This way. ma'am.

996
01:26:10.166 --> 01:26:10.958
I'm Arman.

997
01:26:12.625 --> 01:26:13.541
I'm Dini.

998
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:18.458
-Are you the palace's curator?
-Yes.

999
01:26:20.791 --> 01:26:22.333
Where is the painting?

1000
01:26:23.083 --> 01:26:24.333
In the evidence room.

1001
01:26:25.708 --> 01:26:29.625
Thank you for not revealing
this matter to the public.

1002
01:26:31.375 --> 01:26:33.041
-Come on in.
-Come.

1003
01:27:08.458 --> 01:27:10.541
I'll begin now. Mr. Arman.

1004
01:27:51.208 --> 01:27:53.541
Mr. Arman. Ms. Sita.

1005
01:27:53.625 --> 01:27:58.583
I've marked the real<i> The Arrest of</i>
<i>Prince Diponegoro </i>with a red label.

1006
01:27:58.666 --> 01:28:01.583
You may immediately
take it to the National Gallery.

1007
01:28:04.041 --> 01:28:07.000
And we'll deal with the fake painting.

1008
01:28:07.083 --> 01:28:10.916
We have a special procedure
to dispose of fake paintings.

1009
01:28:11.625 --> 01:28:14.041
It's a national treasure category.
after all.

1010
01:28:47.291 --> 01:28:48.416
What's the matter?

1011
01:28:56.208 --> 01:28:57.875
You can talk to me.

1012
01:28:59.916 --> 01:29:01.500
Hey. Look at me.

1013
01:29:02.583 --> 01:29:03.666
What is it?

1014
01:29:06.333 --> 01:29:07.375
Is Sarah pregnant?

1015
01:29:11.375 --> 01:29:12.625
So what is it?

1016
01:29:32.666 --> 01:29:34.291
You're my son. You're strong.

1017
01:29:36.041 --> 01:29:40.750
Of all the people in this world.
I know you're the strongest.

1018
01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:45.625
You're the toughest guy I know.

1019
01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:53.083
If you can't tell me whatever you're
dealing with. I'll tell you one thing.

1020
01:29:56.625 --> 01:29:57.750
Face it.

1021
01:30:05.875 --> 01:30:08.291
Face the problem like you always do.

1022
01:30:11.625 --> 01:30:12.916
Time's up.

1023
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.541
Sir. Time's up.

1024
01:30:22.458 --> 01:30:24.250
Don't trust anyone else.

1025
01:30:25.625 --> 01:30:27.583
Trust yourself.

1026
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:32.541
Dad.

1027
01:30:37.333 --> 01:30:38.666
Take care.

1028
01:30:41.583 --> 01:30:42.500
Let's move.

1029
01:32:16.916 --> 01:32:19.083
<i>The annual exhibition</i>
<i>of the palace's collection</i>

1030
01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:21.833
is finally here today.
after a year's delay due to the pandemic.

1031
01:32:21.916 --> 01:32:25.083
The public is looking forward
to visiting even before its opening date

1032
01:32:25.166 --> 01:32:27.416
<i>since this gallery features the phenomenal</i>

1033
01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:31.291
The Arrest of Prince Diponegoro
<i>by Raden Saleh.</i>

1034
01:33:14.291 --> 01:33:17.500
Sorry. Sorry. move aside.

1035
01:33:18.083 --> 01:33:20.583
Sir! You can't go there.

1036
01:33:33.875 --> 01:33:35.083
Amazing.

1037
01:33:37.458 --> 01:33:38.333
Careful.

1038
01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:43.500
You now possess the most valuable
painting in history. sir.

1039
01:33:44.375 --> 01:33:46.666
This isn't about the painting. Dini.

1040
01:33:47.250 --> 01:33:50.208
This country has robbed
my political career.

1041
01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:52.541
and my son. Rama.

1042
01:33:52.625 --> 01:33:54.708
This is the day of my revenge.

1043
01:33:57.458 --> 01:34:01.375
You can get your money
in the safe deposit box as usual.

1044
01:34:02.166 --> 01:34:04.000
Thank you. Mr. President.

1045
01:34:04.083 --> 01:34:05.875
Dad. Is it safe to put it here?

1046
01:34:07.333 --> 01:34:10.333
Let's enjoy it for the time being.
And then…

1047
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:14.958
we'll move it after my birthday.

1048
01:34:46.791 --> 01:34:48.541
I knew you would come here.

1049
01:35:04.166 --> 01:35:05.125
Piko.

1050
01:35:05.708 --> 01:35:06.708
Fella.

1051
01:35:08.250 --> 01:35:09.083
Are you okay?

1052
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:12.583
I'm okay. How about you?

1053
01:35:14.166 --> 01:35:15.500
Ucup.

1054
01:35:17.916 --> 01:35:21.750
The painting in the National Gallery
is not the real one.

1055
01:35:21.833 --> 01:35:23.041
It's mine!

1056
01:35:26.125 --> 01:35:28.708
So we were just a decoy all this time.

1057
01:35:28.791 --> 01:35:30.750
A decoy in Permadi's plan.

1058
01:35:31.791 --> 01:35:34.833
-That cop's car is Joker's…
-Hey. hey.

1059
01:35:37.375 --> 01:35:39.083
So what if we're decoys?

1060
01:35:40.375 --> 01:35:41.958
Tuktuk took one for the team anyways.

1061
01:35:42.041 --> 01:35:44.291
-The cops got Ucup's ID as well!
-So what?

1062
01:35:44.375 --> 01:35:46.958
-He's a wanted man!
-So what?

1063
01:35:48.250 --> 01:35:52.041
He's wanted but
Tuktuk is already arrested!

1064
01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:54.125
Don't you all get it?

1065
01:35:59.708 --> 01:36:02.708
We're just sitting here
while he's in jail!

1066
01:36:06.666 --> 01:36:10.166
This. right here.
is what I feared the most.

1067
01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:13.041
If one of us gets caught. what then?

1068
01:36:15.416 --> 01:36:16.583
So we're doing nothing.

1069
01:36:19.333 --> 01:36:20.833
What a bunch of crap.

1070
01:36:23.041 --> 01:36:24.500
You're the one with the plan. right?

1071
01:36:24.583 --> 01:36:29.000
You knew it inside out.
writing notes here and there.

1072
01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:31.916
But now you're quiet. you bastard!

1073
01:36:39.333 --> 01:36:42.125
We've always been together
since we were kids.

1074
01:36:42.208 --> 01:36:44.583
Now he's alone.
I don't know what he's doing.

1075
01:36:44.666 --> 01:36:47.375
I'm afraid they did something to him.

1076
01:36:53.791 --> 01:36:56.416
Tuktuk won't rat us out. right?

1077
01:36:58.375 --> 01:37:01.125
What did you just say?

1078
01:37:03.208 --> 01:37:06.250
My brother and I may not go to school.
but we're not snitches.

1079
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:10.333
Just because you're rich.
Watch your mouth. bitch.

1080
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:18.166
Why can't we just raid the police station?

1081
01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:21.625
-Go in. bring a weapon or two…
-Gofar.

1082
01:37:21.708 --> 01:37:24.125
Being reckless isn't a good idea.

1083
01:37:24.208 --> 01:37:28.250
But my brother is in there!
You guys realize that. right?

1084
01:37:34.958 --> 01:37:36.125
I have an idea.

1085
01:37:45.166 --> 01:37:48.000
That plan of yours was

1086
01:37:48.958 --> 01:37:50.083
flawless.

1087
01:37:50.708 --> 01:37:54.916
I've transferred your reward
of two billion to Poltak.

1088
01:37:56.041 --> 01:38:00.083
Ask him to re-open your case.

1089
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:07.250
What about the Supreme Court judge
that you promised me?

1090
01:38:08.833 --> 01:38:09.875
That's tough.

1091
01:38:11.416 --> 01:38:12.291
Tough.

1092
01:38:15.041 --> 01:38:16.583
-Is it?
-Yeah.

1093
01:38:19.291 --> 01:38:24.166
I gave you a flawless plan
to get what you wanted.

1094
01:38:26.083 --> 01:38:28.250
It's time you returned the favor.

1095
01:38:28.958 --> 01:38:33.416
Poltak won't win the case without the
judge's intervention that you promised me.

1096
01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:37.541
Bud. I'm no longer the President.

1097
01:38:37.625 --> 01:38:38.875
You know that. right?

1098
01:38:39.583 --> 01:38:43.083
Poltak will find a way.
He's a crafty lawyer.

1099
01:38:44.041 --> 01:38:48.125
My part of our deal is done here.

1100
01:38:48.666 --> 01:38:49.500
Okay?

1101
01:38:51.291 --> 01:38:54.166
I can speak up about the painting
if I want to.

1102
01:38:54.250 --> 01:38:56.458
I knew you'd say that.

1103
01:38:59.541 --> 01:39:01.625
But listen to me. Bud.

1104
01:39:02.541 --> 01:39:05.083
I made your one and only son

1105
01:39:05.166 --> 01:39:10.750
get involved in this heist as insurance.

1106
01:39:10.833 --> 01:39:16.125
So. if you try to speak up

1107
01:39:16.208 --> 01:39:17.916
even just the tiniest bit.

1108
01:39:19.458 --> 01:39:23.458
your son might just join you in prison

1109
01:39:23.541 --> 01:39:26.541
for quite some time.

1110
01:39:28.541 --> 01:39:30.916
Oh. by the way. your son…

1111
01:39:32.333 --> 01:39:34.916
He's a great painting forger.

1112
01:39:35.708 --> 01:39:37.000
But. well…

1113
01:39:37.541 --> 01:39:40.416
He's also a stupid
and easy-to-control young man.

1114
01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:43.541
-Hey!
-Hey! Freeze!

1115
01:39:48.666 --> 01:39:49.666
Stay still!

1116
01:39:51.916 --> 01:39:53.791
Why are you dragging my son into this?

1117
01:40:01.708 --> 01:40:04.458
You know the law of the prison. right?

1118
01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:08.125
Hey.

1119
01:40:13.875 --> 01:40:14.916
Come on.

1120
01:40:20.875 --> 01:40:23.625
On December 10th. 1968 in Japan.

1121
01:40:23.708 --> 01:40:26.708
there was a heist so clever
they haven't solved it to this day.

1122
01:40:26.791 --> 01:40:29.041
Hey. hold on a second.

1123
01:40:29.125 --> 01:40:30.916
Why are we talking about a heist again?

1124
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.125
I thought we were rescuing Tuktuk.

1125
01:40:33.208 --> 01:40:34.791
Just listen.

1126
01:40:35.875 --> 01:40:36.916
Let me continue.

1127
01:40:37.666 --> 01:40:41.500
Back then. a car was carrying
300 million yen

1128
01:40:42.166 --> 01:40:44.958
that was meant to be bonuses
for a factory's employees.

1129
01:40:46.208 --> 01:40:50.583
That highly-secured car was suddenly
stopped by a fully-equipped officer

1130
01:40:50.666 --> 01:40:53.250
around 200 meters
from their initial destination.

1131
01:40:54.291 --> 01:40:57.500
The officer gave them a warning

1132
01:40:57.583 --> 01:41:00.541
about a manager who was caught
in a bomb attack.

1133
01:41:01.541 --> 01:41:02.958
and his house blown up.

1134
01:41:04.125 --> 01:41:06.000
That officer told them

1135
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:11.666
he'd got a report that
the car carrying the 300 million

1136
01:41:12.458 --> 01:41:14.000
had been planted with an explosive.

1137
01:41:16.208 --> 01:41:18.916
When the officer checked under the car.

1138
01:41:20.250 --> 01:41:21.333
it was true.

1139
01:41:22.166 --> 01:41:24.750
Sparks of fire and smoke emerged.

1140
01:41:24.833 --> 01:41:27.000
He said the car was gonna explode.

1141
01:41:27.083 --> 01:41:28.750
And it was chaos.

1142
01:41:28.833 --> 01:41:31.291
Before the driver realized
what was happening.

1143
01:41:31.375 --> 01:41:34.458
the fake officer had infiltrated the car

1144
01:41:34.541 --> 01:41:37.666
and run off with the 300 million.

1145
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:39.250
He disappeared from their sight.

1146
01:41:39.333 --> 01:41:41.500
Hold on a second.

1147
01:41:41.583 --> 01:41:44.125
Are you saying that we…

1148
01:41:44.208 --> 01:41:46.708
We can disguise ourselves as cops.

1149
01:41:46.791 --> 01:41:51.458
We'll use the same tactics
and treat the car carrying the 300 million

1150
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.291
as the prisoner car carrying Tuktuk.

1151
01:41:55.083 --> 01:41:57.583
This way we can release him from prison!

1152
01:41:57.666 --> 01:41:59.333
No. no. no.

1153
01:41:59.416 --> 01:42:02.875
Even if it's just a fake bomb threat.
once they catch us.

1154
01:42:02.958 --> 01:42:05.291
they'll charge us with being terrorists
on top of thieves!

1155
01:42:05.375 --> 01:42:06.375
Yeah. agreed.

1156
01:42:07.166 --> 01:42:08.791
-No can do. Ucup.
-Right?

1157
01:42:13.083 --> 01:42:14.333
Tuk?

1158
01:42:14.875 --> 01:42:16.375
Hi. assholes.

1159
01:42:20.541 --> 01:42:22.500
Tuktuk. you're released.

1160
01:42:24.333 --> 01:42:25.333
Please.

1161
01:42:29.583 --> 01:42:33.500
Sir! I was investigating him.
Why is he being released?

1162
01:42:33.583 --> 01:42:36.958
-He's still under investigation.
-He's not a suspect.

1163
01:42:37.041 --> 01:42:41.458
But we caught him in the act!

1164
01:42:41.541 --> 01:42:43.666
If we need more proof. time will tell.

1165
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:46.250
He won't answer us anyway.

1166
01:42:48.166 --> 01:42:52.125
He ran away with the truck
since he was afraid of the thieves.

1167
01:42:52.208 --> 01:42:53.125
Makes sense. right?

1168
01:42:54.125 --> 01:42:57.416
You checked it yourself.
he's listed as the driver.

1169
01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:01.375
Let it go. Sita.
The painting is safe anyways.

1170
01:43:01.458 --> 01:43:04.000
-The exhibition was a success too.
-But not like this.

1171
01:43:04.083 --> 01:43:07.208
Tell me why we kept that kid
for three days here.

1172
01:43:07.291 --> 01:43:09.583
And that's it. And now I'm here.

1173
01:43:13.333 --> 01:43:16.583
Relax. I didn't rat you guys out
in the police station.

1174
01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:19.416
See? I told you so.

1175
01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.000
-But…
-What?

1176
01:43:22.791 --> 01:43:24.375
They know about Ucup.

1177
01:43:29.458 --> 01:43:31.208
If it weren't for Ucup's identity.

1178
01:43:33.125 --> 01:43:35.250
I wouldn't be out of there
and here right now.

1179
01:43:37.208 --> 01:43:38.958
That bastard. Permadi!

1180
01:43:44.250 --> 01:43:45.375
Let's retaliate.

1181
01:43:47.416 --> 01:43:49.666
Permadi did this to us

1182
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:52.833
because he thought
we were just a bunch of kids.

1183
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.208
But he must know

1184
01:43:56.166 --> 01:43:57.666
that we can fight back.

1185
01:44:00.291 --> 01:44:01.625
For Ucup.

1186
01:44:05.125 --> 01:44:07.125
-Sir.
-Here.

1187
01:44:14.416 --> 01:44:15.333
Go ahead.

1188
01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:43.958
LAUNDROMAT. PRISON IA. BANDUNG IV

1189
01:44:47.041 --> 01:44:48.125
All clear.

1190
01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:55.875
Mr. Poltak would like to speak to you.

1191
01:44:58.916 --> 01:45:01.083
<i>This car will take you to a safe house.</i>

1192
01:45:01.166 --> 01:45:05.833
<i>You have 48 hours to completely disappear.</i>

1193
01:45:05.916 --> 01:45:08.333
<i>Remember. don't be reckless.</i>

1194
01:45:08.416 --> 01:45:11.958
<i>This is the best you can get</i>
<i>with two billion.</i>

1195
01:45:12.041 --> 01:45:15.666
<i>I won't deal with you if you get caught.</i>

1196
01:45:20.416 --> 01:45:22.875
This is his weakness. Rama.

1197
01:45:23.541 --> 01:45:25.083
Permadi's beloved son.

1198
01:45:25.166 --> 01:45:27.708
Permadi resigned as president last year

1199
01:45:27.791 --> 01:45:30.750
due to a bribery case that involved Rama
being exposed to the media.

1200
01:45:30.833 --> 01:45:32.416
To suppress the news.

1201
01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:34.666
Permadi had to give up his position.

1202
01:45:37.208 --> 01:45:38.916
Rama is our way in.

1203
01:45:39.708 --> 01:45:42.958
For your information. he's a huge playboy.

1204
01:45:44.791 --> 01:45:48.041
So. our biggest shot would be…

1205
01:45:51.083 --> 01:45:53.250
Me? Why me?

1206
01:45:53.333 --> 01:45:54.208
Well.

1207
01:45:56.708 --> 01:45:59.250
What plan are you thinking of?

1208
01:45:59.333 --> 01:46:02.166
I took care of it.

1209
01:46:02.250 --> 01:46:04.833
Permadi has seen me once before.

1210
01:46:04.916 --> 01:46:07.875
Sure. but you wore a hoodie
back then. right?

1211
01:46:09.791 --> 01:46:11.000
Right?

1212
01:46:22.083 --> 01:46:23.875
<i>Fella can help Sarah with a makeover.</i>

1213
01:46:28.833 --> 01:46:30.333
<i>Permadi's birthday is in two weeks.</i>

1214
01:46:30.416 --> 01:46:33.125
<i>He always throws a party at his house.</i>

1215
01:46:34.250 --> 01:46:37.916
<i>We can take some inspiration</i>
<i>from Sandra Bullock's movie.</i>

1216
01:46:38.708 --> 01:46:40.583
<i>Find an opening and make some chaos.</i>

1217
01:46:47.458 --> 01:46:48.416
<i>Sarah.</i>

1218
01:46:49.166 --> 01:46:50.708
<i>Catch Rama's attention.</i>

1219
01:46:52.083 --> 01:46:53.750
<i>Try to get close to him.</i>

1220
01:46:54.458 --> 01:46:57.375
<i>that he'd invite you</i>
<i>to Permadi's birthday.</i>

1221
01:47:18.916 --> 01:47:20.833
We got him. guys.

1222
01:47:22.291 --> 01:47:23.416
Should we really do this. Far?

1223
01:47:27.041 --> 01:47:28.416
Go for it.

1224
01:47:48.458 --> 01:47:49.458
Here I go.

1225
01:47:50.916 --> 01:47:51.875
Hey.

1226
01:47:52.791 --> 01:47:53.791
Watch it.

1227
01:47:59.916 --> 01:48:01.250
All by yourself?

1228
01:48:02.541 --> 01:48:04.416
Yeah. It's just me.

1229
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:05.458
Did you order drinks?

1230
01:48:08.958 --> 01:48:10.458
Can you order for me?

1231
01:48:11.125 --> 01:48:12.166
What do you want?

1232
01:48:12.250 --> 01:48:14.166
Your choice.

1233
01:48:14.250 --> 01:48:16.458
Sir. one like this.

1234
01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:20.791
Just relax. Loosen up.

1235
01:48:22.916 --> 01:48:24.458
Anyway. if I look closely.

1236
01:48:27.375 --> 01:48:29.208
you're still way more handsome.

1237
01:48:29.291 --> 01:48:32.583
You look like that boy band member.

1238
01:48:41.125 --> 01:48:44.291
Relax. She'll be here soon.

1239
01:48:45.250 --> 01:48:46.666
-There she is.
-Sarah.

1240
01:48:47.583 --> 01:48:48.625
How was it?

1241
01:48:49.125 --> 01:48:50.458
I'm done for.

1242
01:48:50.541 --> 01:48:54.541
He's such a pervert.
He talks big. but he's really lame.

1243
01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:57.750
-Did he take you home?
-Yeah.

1244
01:48:57.833 --> 01:48:59.208
-Good.
-You let him?

1245
01:48:59.291 --> 01:49:03.125
Of course not. I just chose
a random house in Pondok Indah.

1246
01:49:07.083 --> 01:49:10.083
-Is that your phone?
-Oh. yeah.

1247
01:49:12.125 --> 01:49:13.750
It's the pervert.

1248
01:49:14.458 --> 01:49:17.958
It's okay. Pick it up
and say you were sleeping.

1249
01:49:24.916 --> 01:49:27.833
We got him in the trap.

1250
01:49:27.916 --> 01:49:29.416
Your girl's awesome.

1251
01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:32.375
-Nice! We got it!
-I saw it firsthand!

1252
01:49:43.958 --> 01:49:48.958
I'm sure he won't display it
in an open space since it's a stolen item.

1253
01:49:49.625 --> 01:49:54.208
We have to have an insider
in Permadi's house before D-day.

1254
01:49:54.291 --> 01:49:57.625
We need to get into his security system

1255
01:49:57.708 --> 01:50:00.166
and find where he put the painting.

1256
01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:03.250
They'll be on standby
until the extraction…

1257
01:50:05.625 --> 01:50:07.166
to get the painting out.

1258
01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:09.166
Like Clive Owen's movie?

1259
01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:10.166
Indeed.

1260
01:50:11.208 --> 01:50:13.375
Wait. Hold on.

1261
01:50:14.625 --> 01:50:16.708
You want an extraction?
From inside to outside?

1262
01:50:16.791 --> 01:50:17.625
Yeah.

1263
01:50:17.708 --> 01:50:19.416
We don't even know
the inside of his house.

1264
01:50:20.125 --> 01:50:24.875
Well. we need to have access
to his event organization team.

1265
01:50:24.958 --> 01:50:27.875
Guess it'll be Tuktuk and me again.

1266
01:50:27.958 --> 01:50:29.083
No. Far.

1267
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:32.625
-I'll do it.
-Okay. You're going with me.

1268
01:50:32.708 --> 01:50:35.750
Wait. could you even be hired?

1269
01:50:35.833 --> 01:50:37.625
You're a wanted guy now.

1270
01:50:43.833 --> 01:50:45.166
Where is the document?

1271
01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:51.625
Remember what I taught you.

1272
01:50:53.583 --> 01:50:54.916
What's the matter. Fel?

1273
01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.833
You even came here to talk to me.

1274
01:50:57.916 --> 01:51:00.375
Can't we talk at home?

1275
01:51:01.125 --> 01:51:03.208
Do you even have any time at home?

1276
01:51:04.041 --> 01:51:06.041
-Here's the document.
-Thanks.

1277
01:51:08.833 --> 01:51:09.750
Gito.

1278
01:51:10.958 --> 01:51:14.333
Please check everything
before we buy this company.

1279
01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:20.708
So. Mom.

1280
01:51:21.875 --> 01:51:26.583
I'm thinking of having a business.

1281
01:51:29.458 --> 01:51:33.875
Something I can operate
while studying in college.

1282
01:51:34.708 --> 01:51:36.833
There you go.

1283
01:51:38.875 --> 01:51:40.458
What kind of business?

1284
01:51:47.833 --> 01:51:48.791
So…

1285
01:51:48.875 --> 01:51:50.083
Here.

1286
01:51:50.166 --> 01:51:51.916
All the files we need.

1287
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.500
From the event's breakdown. decorations.

1288
01:51:54.583 --> 01:51:57.000
catering. timeline.
and even the house plan.

1289
01:51:57.083 --> 01:51:58.875
This is amazing.

1290
01:51:58.958 --> 01:52:03.375
You were gone for three days.
and now you're back with all this.

1291
01:52:04.375 --> 01:52:07.166
Tomorrow. you and Ucup
can start work there.

1292
01:52:07.250 --> 01:52:09.333
-No CV required.
-Yes!

1293
01:52:09.416 --> 01:52:11.416
-How did you do that?
-Crazy.

1294
01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:13.250
She bought the company.

1295
01:52:13.333 --> 01:52:15.083
-No wonder.
-Damn.

1296
01:52:15.166 --> 01:52:16.416
Bestie.

1297
01:52:17.208 --> 01:52:20.208
From today. I'm in charge
of their operations.

1298
01:52:20.291 --> 01:52:22.166
Mr. Gito is the CEO.

1299
01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:26.416
How do you buy a company?

1300
01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.166
You won't get it.

1301
01:52:28.250 --> 01:52:30.416
-Damn.
-Yeah. I don't get it.

1302
01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:31.708
Guys.

1303
01:52:33.458 --> 01:52:35.375
Rama is asking me out to dinner.

1304
01:52:37.291 --> 01:52:39.000
Nice!

1305
01:52:48.458 --> 01:52:49.375
There. there.

1306
01:53:02.375 --> 01:53:03.750
Anya.

1307
01:53:06.875 --> 01:53:07.833
Have a seat.

1308
01:53:16.666 --> 01:53:17.666
Drink.

1309
01:53:18.958 --> 01:53:22.250
You look gorgeous tonight.

1310
01:53:24.375 --> 01:53:29.625
We have matching outfits.
Look. Is this fate?

1311
01:53:30.458 --> 01:53:34.125
<i>We checked all the to-do lists</i>
<i>to get inside Permadi's house.</i>

1312
01:53:35.291 --> 01:53:37.458
Tuk. Your car won't be able to reach here.

1313
01:53:37.541 --> 01:53:40.541
but I want you to take us here
no matter what.

1314
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.500
THE SERVER ROOM

1315
01:53:47.333 --> 01:53:48.541
The server room. Far.

1316
01:53:50.666 --> 01:53:52.125
So. you need me.

1317
01:54:13.125 --> 01:54:15.250
Stop. What is this?

1318
01:54:15.333 --> 01:54:16.625
What's the problem. sir?

1319
01:54:16.708 --> 01:54:19.041
-What is this?
-It's the sound system.

1320
01:54:19.125 --> 01:54:20.625
-Okay. Go ahead.
-Go on.

1321
01:54:48.541 --> 01:54:50.000
Left or right?

1322
01:54:51.166 --> 01:54:52.833
Man. I've forgotten.

1323
01:54:52.916 --> 01:54:55.000
Let me ask. Hey. Ucup.

1324
01:54:55.083 --> 01:54:56.708
Is it left or right?

1325
01:54:58.250 --> 01:55:00.250
How should I know. dumbass?

1326
01:55:00.333 --> 01:55:02.416
-I can't see shit!
-What?

1327
01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:04.875
Did you just ask Ucup?

1328
01:55:04.958 --> 01:55:07.083
You two! What are you doing?

1329
01:55:09.458 --> 01:55:12.875
Excuse me. sir. Where is the server room?

1330
01:55:12.958 --> 01:55:14.666
Go straight. and then turn left.

1331
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:18.333
-Straight and left. Thank you. sir.
-Yes.

1332
01:55:22.916 --> 01:55:25.041
Man. have you gone mad?

1333
01:55:25.125 --> 01:55:26.583
We could have been exposed!

1334
01:55:26.666 --> 01:55:29.333
You're not the only idiot here!

1335
01:55:31.916 --> 01:55:34.208
Fella. we're almost there.

1336
01:55:35.625 --> 01:55:36.625
Excuse me!

1337
01:55:36.708 --> 01:55:39.833
I'm looking for the storage room.
Is this it?

1338
01:55:39.916 --> 01:55:41.541
This is the CCTV room. miss.

1339
01:55:41.625 --> 01:55:44.125
I see. Where's the storage room. sir?

1340
01:55:44.208 --> 01:55:46.500
-There.
-Right there?

1341
01:55:46.583 --> 01:55:48.500
After 50 meters. go left.

1342
01:55:48.583 --> 01:55:50.958
-All right. thank you. sir.
-Sure.

1343
01:56:08.041 --> 01:56:09.791
<i>Once we've got hold of the CCTV.</i>

1344
01:56:11.041 --> 01:56:12.750
<i>the first phase is cleared.</i>

1345
01:56:13.666 --> 01:56:17.833
Is there anything that we can use
as a time bomb to get us out of there?

1346
01:56:18.541 --> 01:56:20.208
We need an extraction plan.

1347
01:56:20.291 --> 01:56:21.166
A time bomb?

1348
01:56:21.833 --> 01:56:22.666
Yeah.

1349
01:56:23.291 --> 01:56:26.458
A way to create chaos.
like I told you before.

1350
01:56:28.875 --> 01:56:29.708
Babe.

1351
01:56:31.625 --> 01:56:33.208
I'm the only one

1352
01:56:33.291 --> 01:56:35.208
who can get us out.

1353
01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:24.166
You okay?

1354
01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:32.416
Guys.

1355
01:57:34.958 --> 01:57:36.125
The package is here.

1356
01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:39.541
-We got no other choice.
-Dad.

1357
01:57:41.041 --> 01:57:42.416
<i>I don't like this.</i>

1358
01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:43.750
<i>It's too risky for Sarah.</i>

1359
01:57:44.791 --> 01:57:46.500
If something happens

1360
01:57:46.583 --> 01:57:47.500
what. then?

1361
01:57:55.250 --> 01:57:57.750
Listen. I got a plan.

1362
01:57:57.833 --> 01:57:59.500
Just give it a thought.

1363
01:58:05.083 --> 01:58:08.208
<i>I'll modify the device</i>
<i>that I put in your car back then</i>

1364
01:58:08.291 --> 01:58:12.333
<i>so that we can control it remotely.</i>

1365
01:58:12.416 --> 01:58:15.375
<i>We can place it near the smoke detector.</i>

1366
01:58:15.458 --> 01:58:16.541
<i>How is it?</i>

1367
01:58:16.625 --> 01:58:18.041
All yours. Boss Ucup!

1368
01:58:18.125 --> 01:58:19.791
Okay!

1369
01:58:20.333 --> 01:58:22.125
-Please.
-I'll try it.

1370
01:58:22.208 --> 01:58:23.333
Sure.

1371
01:58:30.750 --> 01:58:32.750
There's our time bomb!

1372
01:58:35.333 --> 01:58:37.458
Time to be real thieves.

1373
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:44.000
You're a genius. bro!

1374
01:58:48.041 --> 01:58:49.666
One. two. three!

1375
01:58:50.916 --> 01:58:52.250
Okay. Yeah.

1376
01:59:00.125 --> 01:59:01.125
Excuse me.

1377
01:59:39.333 --> 01:59:40.208
Piko.

1378
01:59:40.791 --> 01:59:42.000
Done with the editing?

1379
01:59:43.250 --> 01:59:44.791
All right. done. Come on.

1380
01:59:44.875 --> 01:59:46.166
-Careful.
-Thanks.

1381
01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:47.458
-Let's go.
-Right.

1382
01:59:51.125 --> 01:59:52.458
<i>Fella. we're ready.</i>

1383
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:54.875
Excuse me.

1384
01:59:54.958 --> 01:59:55.791
-Sir.
-Yes?

1385
01:59:55.875 --> 01:59:59.666
-Please. have some snacks.
-You didn't have to. miss.

1386
01:59:59.750 --> 02:00:01.083
-It's for me?
-Yes. sir.

1387
02:00:01.166 --> 02:00:03.875
<i>It's no bother. We prepared it for you.</i>

1388
02:00:03.958 --> 02:00:04.916
<i>All right.</i>

1389
02:00:07.958 --> 02:00:10.416
Okay. I'm going back now. sir.

1390
02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:11.833
Enjoy the food.

1391
02:00:12.583 --> 02:00:15.083
Nice! To keep me up all night.

1392
02:00:15.166 --> 02:00:16.166
We're good. Ucup.

1393
02:00:17.833 --> 02:00:18.791
Good.

1394
02:01:10.166 --> 02:01:12.166
The painting is in the East Pavilion.

1395
02:01:13.708 --> 02:01:14.833
Okay.

1396
02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.750
-Please deliver this.
-Okay.

1397
02:01:33.166 --> 02:01:34.541
Do you want a drink?

1398
02:01:36.916 --> 02:01:38.166
Give her that one.

1399
02:02:06.791 --> 02:02:09.916
EAST PAVILION CORRIDOR

1400
02:02:31.333 --> 02:02:32.833
What's wrong?

1401
02:02:35.708 --> 02:02:36.583
Let's go.

1402
02:03:11.041 --> 02:03:11.916
Piko.

1403
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:12.833
What?

1404
02:03:21.666 --> 02:03:24.625
Finally! I can see the real
Raden Saleh painting!

1405
02:03:29.833 --> 02:03:31.500
Piko and I are in position.

1406
02:03:39.541 --> 02:03:41.166
Fella. this is bad!

1407
02:03:41.250 --> 02:03:42.583
<i>Fella!</i>

1408
02:03:43.458 --> 02:03:46.500
Our spot is taken by a grilled goat stall!

1409
02:03:47.291 --> 02:03:48.291
All right.

1410
02:03:48.375 --> 02:03:49.541
<i>We'll have to improvise.</i>

1411
02:03:50.291 --> 02:03:51.125
<i>Let's improvise.</i>

1412
02:03:52.833 --> 02:03:54.083
Improvise?

1413
02:04:01.416 --> 02:04:03.166
Come on. Piko!

1414
02:04:03.833 --> 02:04:06.500
I need a hand! Hey!

1415
02:04:08.833 --> 02:04:09.708
Piko!

1416
02:04:13.666 --> 02:04:15.500
It's Agus Suwage's. Ucup.

1417
02:04:28.166 --> 02:04:29.416
Bomb's in place.

1418
02:04:32.083 --> 02:04:34.250
Ten minutes before the chaos.

1419
02:04:35.041 --> 02:04:35.916
Wait!

1420
02:05:07.166 --> 02:05:09.416
How is it? Is the bar doing okay?

1421
02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:11.541
-All clear.
-Okay. Any complaints so far?

1422
02:05:11.625 --> 02:05:12.541
BE PATIENT. THERE'S SOME IMPROVISATION.

1423
02:05:13.333 --> 02:05:14.583
So far. nothing.

1424
02:05:15.291 --> 02:05:17.000
Okay. thank you.

1425
02:05:24.625 --> 02:05:27.291
Men. Check the CCTV.

1426
02:05:27.375 --> 02:05:30.666
Find the waiter who came
to the East Pavilion.

1427
02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:32.000
Check it now.

1428
02:06:08.250 --> 02:06:09.500
<i>Sir!</i>

1429
02:06:10.958 --> 02:06:12.041
Yes. copy.

1430
02:06:12.125 --> 02:06:14.000
<i>Eagle one is ready at the front. sir.</i>

1431
02:06:34.041 --> 02:06:36.250
Fella! Gofar! Where are you guys?

1432
02:06:36.333 --> 02:06:37.458
Damn! We almost got caught!

1433
02:06:37.541 --> 02:06:39.166
Give me a second.

1434
02:06:42.458 --> 02:06:43.375
Listen to me.

1435
02:06:43.458 --> 02:06:45.166
<i>Five minutes' time. okay?</i>

1436
02:06:54.833 --> 02:06:57.541
Gofar. The door is locked.

1437
02:06:57.625 --> 02:06:59.083
I'll handle that. okay?

1438
02:06:59.166 --> 02:07:01.083
<i>-It's all good.</i>
-Sinta.

1439
02:07:04.208 --> 02:07:06.541
Find out when the band will finish.

1440
02:07:06.625 --> 02:07:09.375
We need to bring out the cake after that.

1441
02:07:09.458 --> 02:07:10.416
Okay?

1442
02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:11.416
Thank you.

1443
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.708
You ready?

1444
02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:15.791
Okay.

1445
02:07:25.541 --> 02:07:26.708
Five.

1446
02:07:26.791 --> 02:07:27.625
Four.

1447
02:07:28.458 --> 02:07:29.416
Three.

1448
02:07:30.333 --> 02:07:31.166
Two.

1449
02:07:37.583 --> 02:07:39.583
-It's not working!
<i>-Huh?!</i>

1450
02:07:39.666 --> 02:07:42.583
-What do you mean?
<i>-It's not fucking working!</i>

1451
02:07:42.666 --> 02:07:45.208
<i>-What's not working?</i>
<i>-I turned it on. but nothing!</i>

1452
02:07:45.291 --> 02:07:48.208
Tuktuk. Gofar. report what's happening.

1453
02:07:48.958 --> 02:07:50.958
Gofar will try to turn it on manually.

1454
02:07:51.041 --> 02:07:54.875
-I can't! I'll get caught that way!
-We got no choice!

1455
02:07:55.833 --> 02:07:58.916
Stop fighting.
Let's think up a solution for this.

1456
02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
But Piko and I are stuck here!

1457
02:08:08.208 --> 02:08:09.375
Excuse me.

1458
02:08:09.458 --> 02:08:11.791
Sarah. Gofar's device is broken.

1459
02:08:11.875 --> 02:08:14.750
The plan's busted.
We need a contingency now.

1460
02:08:16.208 --> 02:08:17.125
Where's Piko?

1461
02:08:17.875 --> 02:08:19.291
Stuck in the room.

1462
02:08:27.125 --> 02:08:31.333
Okay. Tell the others.
I'll be the time bomb.

1463
02:08:31.416 --> 02:08:34.041
-Just like my initial plan.
-You sure?

1464
02:08:38.875 --> 02:08:40.500
How was it?

1465
02:08:41.458 --> 02:08:45.750
Guys. Sarah's leading the plan now.
Sarah will be the time bomb.

1466
02:08:49.791 --> 02:08:52.083
That will never work!

1467
02:08:52.166 --> 02:08:53.875
Only my device can do it!

1468
02:08:56.500 --> 02:08:57.666
Hey.

1469
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:59.125
What is it?

1470
02:08:59.208 --> 02:09:00.916
The party is so boring.

1471
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.708
You want us to be alone?

1472
02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.791
Bastard. you pervert!

1473
02:09:10.791 --> 02:09:13.333
You! Teach her a lesson!

1474
02:09:47.333 --> 02:09:49.500
Happy birthday. Mr. President!

1475
02:09:49.583 --> 02:09:50.666
Thank you.

1476
02:09:52.208 --> 02:09:53.833
What's with the commotion?

1477
02:10:26.625 --> 02:10:27.666
Who are you?

1478
02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:29.583
May I get to know you?

1479
02:10:35.958 --> 02:10:38.958
The crowd won't scram. Cup.

1480
02:10:39.041 --> 02:10:41.083
Damn it!

1481
02:10:50.416 --> 02:10:53.875
The situation's changed!
Fuck! What should we do now. Cup?

1482
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:07.375
You keep watch here. okay?

1483
02:11:08.458 --> 02:11:09.375
Hey!

1484
02:11:25.333 --> 02:11:26.791
Fuck! Get working! Come on!

1485
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:32.916
It's chaos time!

1486
02:11:55.125 --> 02:11:56.916
What happened?

1487
02:12:00.166 --> 02:12:01.333
Hurry up!

1488
02:12:02.291 --> 02:12:03.416
Damn! So noisy!

1489
02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:04.833
Just go first!

1490
02:12:12.833 --> 02:12:14.000
What are you doing?!

1491
02:12:14.083 --> 02:12:15.041
Sir!

1492
02:12:15.125 --> 02:12:17.166
-Why didn't you do anything?
-What happened. sir?

1493
02:12:17.250 --> 02:12:18.958
Nothing is going on.

1494
02:12:20.625 --> 02:12:23.041
-There's an intruder!
-An intruder?

1495
02:12:28.625 --> 02:12:30.583
A fire broke out!

1496
02:12:50.458 --> 02:12:51.541
Move it!

1497
02:13:00.125 --> 02:13:01.500
-Come on.
-Let's go.

1498
02:13:02.833 --> 02:13:04.333
Slowly. okay?

1499
02:13:04.416 --> 02:13:05.750
Be careful.

1500
02:13:06.625 --> 02:13:08.750
-Go. The others will be with me.
-Okay.

1501
02:13:09.916 --> 02:13:10.958
All right. thank you.

1502
02:13:11.041 --> 02:13:13.000
-Careful. Fella.
-Yeah.

1503
02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.166
Shall we go?

1504
02:14:22.541 --> 02:14:23.916
Okay.

1505
02:14:24.541 --> 02:14:27.083
Meet at the empty space in 15 minutes.

1506
02:14:28.958 --> 02:14:30.083
Thanks. Fella.

1507
02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:33.875
They got away!

1508
02:14:33.958 --> 02:14:35.541
Everyone's safe.

1509
02:14:35.625 --> 02:14:37.166
It's done? We did it?

1510
02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:39.083
We did it. Man!

1511
02:14:44.750 --> 02:14:46.458
Piko!

1512
02:14:48.041 --> 02:14:49.250
Hurry! Hit the gas. Piko!

1513
02:14:50.125 --> 02:14:52.166
Hit the gas. Piko!

1514
02:14:58.166 --> 02:15:00.916
-Give me the key!
-We're only catering staff!

1515
02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:02.041
Give me the key!

1516
02:15:18.708 --> 02:15:21.625
Give me the key! Give it to me!

1517
02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:09.916
Piko!

1518
02:16:10.541 --> 02:16:11.916
Piko!

1519
02:16:20.916 --> 02:16:23.750
Oh my goodness!

1520
02:16:31.166 --> 02:16:33.166
<i>Move it!</i>

1521
02:16:46.083 --> 02:16:47.791
What is this. Dad?

1522
02:16:59.958 --> 02:17:02.083
It wasn't supposed to end like this.

1523
02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:08.875
Why. Dad?

1524
02:17:08.958 --> 02:17:10.000
Why?

1525
02:17:10.583 --> 02:17:12.750
I could have set you free!

1526
02:17:12.833 --> 02:17:15.791
-No one can set me free!
-I can!

1527
02:17:19.916 --> 02:17:23.000
Permadi set a trap for both of us!

1528
02:17:27.333 --> 02:17:29.500
"Don't trust anyone else."

1529
02:17:29.583 --> 02:17:31.291
Is this what you meant?

1530
02:17:38.416 --> 02:17:41.208
This is the only way to save myself.

1531
02:17:43.541 --> 02:17:45.208
If only there was another way…

1532
02:17:50.125 --> 02:17:51.333
Forgive me.

1533
02:17:53.541 --> 02:17:54.666
Let's hurry!

1534
02:18:47.791 --> 02:18:48.875
Damn it.

1535
02:18:50.458 --> 02:18:51.625
Damn it!

1536
02:18:54.250 --> 02:18:55.333
Damn.

1537
02:18:58.166 --> 02:18:59.833
I lost him.

1538
02:19:01.250 --> 02:19:03.958
I don't have anyone now. Cup.

1539
02:19:09.875 --> 02:19:11.083
Piko.

1540
02:19:16.291 --> 02:19:18.083
You still got me.

1541
02:19:20.791 --> 02:19:22.208
You still got Sarah.

1542
02:19:24.583 --> 02:19:26.250
You still got the others.

1543
02:19:29.375 --> 02:19:30.750
All of us

1544
02:19:32.708 --> 02:19:34.125
are your family. Piko.

1545
02:19:52.125 --> 02:19:53.458
What happened. Piko?

1546
02:19:53.541 --> 02:19:55.500
Get him into the car.

1547
02:19:55.583 --> 02:19:56.541
Piko.

1548
02:19:59.250 --> 02:20:01.958
-The door's open. right?
-Is it open?

1549
02:20:02.958 --> 02:20:04.083
Come on.

1550
02:21:00.541 --> 02:21:02.208
<i>It's Agus Suwage's. Ucup.</i>

1551
02:21:02.916 --> 02:21:05.541
So what?

1552
02:21:05.625 --> 02:21:07.458
-You want that too?
-No!

1553
02:21:07.541 --> 02:21:09.666
-What about it then?
-A contingency.

1554
02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:12.916
Why don't we go with two plans. A and B?

1555
02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:16.041
Let's not choose. but run them both.

1556
02:21:24.916 --> 02:21:26.416
<i>Bomb's in place.</i>

1557
02:21:28.291 --> 02:21:29.458
Wait!

1558
02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:33.041
Okay.

1559
02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:36.083
Listen. Ucup.

1560
02:21:36.166 --> 02:21:38.291
<i>This painting of Raden Saleh's.</i>

1561
02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:42.708
<i>as I said. it's not only about resistance.</i>

1562
02:21:43.541 --> 02:21:46.791
<i>Behind that episode of arrest.</i>

1563
02:21:46.875 --> 02:21:50.333
<i>there was also a story of betrayal.</i>

1564
02:21:55.750 --> 02:21:58.375
<i>You've planted a surprise</i>
<i>in the server room.</i>

1565
02:21:58.458 --> 02:22:00.791
-A laptop is connected to the cables.
<i>-Turn it off!</i>

1566
02:22:00.875 --> 02:22:02.958
-But. Sir…
<i>-Just turn it off!</i>

1567
02:22:03.041 --> 02:22:05.458
<i>It's about improvisation.</i>

1568
02:22:05.541 --> 02:22:09.916
<i>What we can learn</i>
<i>from </i>The Arrest of Prince Diponegoro

1569
02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.375
<i>is that he never had any contingency plan.</i>

1570
02:22:13.458 --> 02:22:17.166
When the lights are out.
Gofar and Tuktuk will take the painting.

1571
02:22:17.250 --> 02:22:20.208
<i>They'll put it into the sound mixer box.</i>

1572
02:22:25.250 --> 02:22:26.250
Come on. Tuktuk.

1573
02:22:27.500 --> 02:22:28.291
Slowly!

1574
02:22:28.375 --> 02:22:30.083
-Get it tilted!
-Okay.

1575
02:22:30.166 --> 02:22:31.291
Tilt it more.

1576
02:22:31.375 --> 02:22:32.666
It's not enough.

1577
02:22:40.041 --> 02:22:43.125
<i>So. from now on.</i>

1578
02:22:43.208 --> 02:22:47.333
<i>we cannot act without a contingency plan.</i>

1579
02:22:47.416 --> 02:22:48.791
Are you done?

1580
02:22:49.458 --> 02:22:52.333
-We're done.
-Done?

1581
02:22:52.416 --> 02:22:55.791
Where do we go? Huh?

1582
02:23:41.333 --> 02:23:45.708
Rama. Rama. Rama.

1583
02:23:47.208 --> 02:23:50.708
Find the one who did this.

1584
02:23:51.291 --> 02:23:52.375
Yes. Boss.

1585
02:23:52.458 --> 02:23:53.583
Find it!

1586
02:24:04.833 --> 02:24:06.708
Pick it up.

1587
02:24:17.541 --> 02:24:18.708
You did great.

1588
02:24:20.625 --> 02:24:24.375
I saw you and Piko
bringing that painting outside.

1589
02:24:37.750 --> 02:24:39.791
<i>I have an interesting offer.</i>

1590
02:24:39.875 --> 02:24:41.583
A prospective buyer

1591
02:24:41.666 --> 02:24:43.708
would pay ten million dollars for it.

1592
02:24:46.416 --> 02:24:47.541
Hold on.

1593
02:24:47.625 --> 02:24:49.208
Hold on. Let me think.

1594
02:24:53.041 --> 02:24:56.291
So. Dini wants to buy this painting?

1595
02:24:56.916 --> 02:24:58.833
How much is ten million dollars?

1596
02:24:58.916 --> 02:25:02.583
One hundred and fifty

1597
02:25:03.458 --> 02:25:04.250
billion.

1598
02:25:04.958 --> 02:25:06.750
-One hundred and fifty billion?
-All of that's money?

1599
02:25:07.750 --> 02:25:09.416
One hundred and fifty billion.

1600
02:25:11.791 --> 02:25:13.541
Hey! Tuktuk! Gosh!

1601
02:25:14.250 --> 02:25:15.166
One hundred and fifty billion?

1602
02:25:15.250 --> 02:25:19.083
-One hundred and fifty billion?
-One hundred and fifty billion?

1603
02:25:19.166 --> 02:25:21.875
