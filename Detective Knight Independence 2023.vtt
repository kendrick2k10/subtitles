00:07:02.204 --> 00:07:03.597
Lead the way.

70
00:07:04.467 --> 00:07:07.165

00:07:15.173 --> 00:07:17.393
Officer.

72
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.221

00:07:23.094 --> 00:07:24.444
All right.

75
00:07:25.532 --> 00:07:28.143
Fuck!

76
00:07:28.186 --> 00:07:30.188
-Prep the bus.

77
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.758
-Come on.

78
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.546
-Come on!

79
00:07:42.723 --> 00:07:45.116
Motherfucker!

80
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.075
Oh. fuck!

81
00:07:47.118 --> 00:07:50.078
What? What the fuck
are you doing?Help.

82
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:52.297
Fuck. Dezi!Oh. my God!

83
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:55.431
Come on.Are you two fucking
old enough to be EMTs?

84
00:08:32.337 --> 00:08:34.557
The pulse is.
uh. 50 bpm.

85
00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:36.559
The renal artery was nicked.Prep for surgery.

86
00:08:36.603 --> 00:08:38.474
-Two bags O neg.
-Sir. eyes open.
Look at me.

87
00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:41.433
Can you tell me your name?
Tell me your name. Sir? Sir?

88
00:08:41.477 --> 00:08:44.567
Okay. Make a hole. make a hole.
We'’re coming through.

89
00:08:44.611 --> 00:08:47.657
Get the trauma surgeon in.
Where is Bradley? Get me...

90
00:08:55.447 --> 00:08:56.536
You okay?

91
00:09:06.197 --> 00:09:07.459
Can I bum a cig?

92
00:11:49.796 --> 00:11:53.408
-Oh. How did you find it?

93
00:11:54.061 --> 00:11:57.760
-Oh. where is she?
-You'’re the detective.
You tell me.

94
00:11:57.804 --> 00:12:00.023
You'’re right.
Once upon a time--

95
00:12:00.067 --> 00:12:02.373
Once upon a time.
I had a husband

96
00:12:02.417 --> 00:12:06.290
who didn'’t give a shit
about my feelings
or my time.

97
00:12:09.293 --> 00:12:11.731
I just want to talk
to my daughter.She'’s an adult.

98
00:12:11.774 --> 00:12:14.037
She doesn'’t have
to talk to you
if she doesn'’t want to.

99
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:15.560
I'’m better than ever.
Hell--

100
00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:17.345
She doesn'’t want
to talk to you.

101
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:20.827
Her last text
was two words: "Bite me."

102
00:12:22.698 --> 00:12:24.439
I'’m trying to apologize.

103
00:12:27.268 --> 00:12:28.443
What'’s that?

104
00:12:29.226 --> 00:12:30.662
What'’s it look like?

105
00:12:33.622 --> 00:12:34.971
She isn'’t a child.

106
00:12:35.015 --> 00:12:36.668
She'’ll always be my kid.

107
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:42.109
Just--
You leave the bear.
I'’ll make sure she gets it.

108
00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:46.983
So. you were telling me
about Turks and Caicos.

109
00:12:47.027 --> 00:12:48.942
Hey.
don'’t worry about him.

110
00:12:49.507 --> 00:12:52.380
If there'’s one thing
that he'’s good at.
it'’s leaving.

111
00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:09.353
Thanks. everyone.

112
00:13:20.669 --> 00:13:23.150
"Out of the night
that covers me.

113
00:13:23.193 --> 00:13:25.326
black is the pit
from pole to pole.

114
00:13:26.457 --> 00:13:31.071
I thank whatever God may be
for my unconquerable soul.

115
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.814
In the fell clutch
of circumstance.

116
00:13:35.858 --> 00:13:39.688
I have not winced
or cried aloud.

117
00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:41.908
Under the bludgeonings
of chance.

118
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:44.693
my head is bloody
but unbowed.

119
00:13:46.347 --> 00:13:48.088
Beyond this place
of wrath and shade.

120
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:51.526
and yet
the menace of years finds

121
00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:53.397
and shall find me unafraid.

122
00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:57.184
It matters not
how straight the gate.

123
00:13:57.227 --> 00:13:59.882
how charged with punishments
the scroll.

124
00:14:01.057 --> 00:14:02.842
I am the master
of my fate.

125
00:14:04.887 --> 00:14:06.758
and I am the captain
of my soul."

126
00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:16.986
To Officer Rebecca Flanagan
and Officer Edgar Cortez.

127
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.901
Good cops never die.

128
00:14:18.945 --> 00:14:22.862
they just get promoted
to the precinct in the sky.

129
00:14:25.038 --> 00:14:26.169
Rest in power.

130
00:14:29.042 --> 00:14:30.217
To Officer Flanagan

131
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.740
and Officer Cortez.

132
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.874
Hear. hear.

133
00:14:34.917 --> 00:14:36.658
Next round is on me.

134
00:14:38.007 --> 00:14:39.052
Thank you.

135
00:14:41.706 --> 00:14:42.969
Whoo!

136
00:14:43.926 --> 00:14:45.754
Uh. two Budweisers.

137
00:14:47.103 --> 00:14:48.626
I need a drink.

138
00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:51.803
Waiter.

139
00:14:56.547 --> 00:14:58.419
Here you go. kid.
Six bucks even.

140
00:14:58.462 --> 00:14:59.768
Hey. asshole.

141
00:15:00.508 --> 00:15:01.944
The man
just saved a life.

142
00:15:01.988 --> 00:15:03.424
He'’s earned a free one.

143
00:15:06.731 --> 00:15:08.342
I hate this place.

144
00:15:08.385 --> 00:15:09.821
It has its charms.

145
00:15:16.828 --> 00:15:20.093
Fifteen bucks.You said six.

146
00:15:20.136 --> 00:15:21.616
Well.
with the tequila
it'’s 15.

147
00:15:21.659 --> 00:15:22.922
What tequila?

148
00:15:24.097 --> 00:15:25.533
I don'’t see any tequila.

149
00:15:25.576 --> 00:15:26.621
Whatever.

150
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:31.843
Don'’t roofie
my drink.

151
00:15:53.996 --> 00:15:56.259
Captain wants me
pulling swing all week.

152
00:15:56.303 --> 00:16:00.350
-Tell the union.
-Hmm. I should.

153
00:16:00.394 --> 00:16:03.223
You know-- You know.
too many stupid people

154
00:16:03.266 --> 00:16:05.573
around here at this time
doing stupid things.

155
00:16:05.616 --> 00:16:07.488
Hey. give me the Fourth
over Halloween

156
00:16:07.531 --> 00:16:09.490
and Christmas any day.

157
00:16:09.533 --> 00:16:11.579
A couple of kids
shooting some fireworks?

158
00:16:11.622 --> 00:16:13.276
No biggie for me.

159
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.149
You know. those fireworks
set off every single alarm

160
00:16:16.192 --> 00:16:20.109
in Teslas
and every single building
from here to Anaheim.

161
00:16:20.153 --> 00:16:22.503
It actually makes me
miss New York.

162
00:16:22.546 --> 00:16:26.768
And you'’re gonna have
to deal with so many
bullshit phone calls.

163
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:28.248
Yo. Justin Bieber!

164
00:16:29.684 --> 00:16:31.468
You eavesdropping
right now?

165
00:16:31.512 --> 00:16:34.950
Yeah. um. I'’m busted.

166
00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.082
My name is Dezi. I--

167
00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:37.431
We don'’t give a fuck.

168
00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:44.351
This is a cop bar.

169
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.920
What kind of badge
is it?

170
00:16:51.488 --> 00:16:52.794
EMT?

171
00:16:55.231 --> 00:16:57.059
You think
that means something?

172
00:16:57.103 --> 00:16:58.800
Yeah. so. uh.

173
00:16:58.843 --> 00:17:00.454
I just have to save
your sorry asses.

174
00:17:00.497 --> 00:17:02.108
but I can'’t have a beer
with you?

175
00:17:02.804 --> 00:17:04.849
Too thick to make it
as a doctor.

176
00:17:06.503 --> 00:17:08.070
Look. I'’ve got a lot
of respect

177
00:17:08.114 --> 00:17:11.334
for my. uh.
blue-blooded brothers.
right?

178
00:17:11.987 --> 00:17:13.119
My mother was a guard.

179
00:17:14.772 --> 00:17:16.426
So. your mother
was a guard?

180
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:17.862
And you'’re bragging
about that?

181
00:17:17.906 --> 00:17:19.299
Guards.

182
00:17:19.342 --> 00:17:20.909
They'’re like
the Irish us.

183
00:17:20.952 --> 00:17:23.520
Oh. yeah.
Are you Irish. huh?

184
00:17:23.564 --> 00:17:25.261
Uh--

185
00:17:25.305 --> 00:17:27.350
I hear that.
uh. Irish girls
are very easy.

186
00:17:27.394 --> 00:17:29.657
How is your mother?

187
00:17:33.878 --> 00:17:36.881
You must have shit
for brains to step in
front of me like this.

188
00:17:36.925 --> 00:17:39.014
Okay.You'’re gonna have
to go.

189
00:17:39.362 --> 00:17:42.191
-Well. I thought this
was the land of the free.
-It ain'’t for you.

190
00:17:42.235 --> 00:17:44.672
Yeah.All right. I think I'’ll
finish my beer. Thank you.

191
00:17:44.715 --> 00:17:47.631
You have to go.Oh. great.
There'’s a baseball bat?

192
00:17:47.675 --> 00:17:50.895
-Get the fuck out of here.
-What is this.
like a softball league?

193
00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:52.506
You'’re gonna
have to go.What'’s going on?

194
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:54.638
You wanna go?
Sign me up. I'’m down.

195
00:17:54.682 --> 00:17:56.423
Give me
the fucking baseball bat.

196
00:18:21.491 --> 00:18:23.841
Come on. let'’s go.
He'’s not worth it.

197
00:18:50.651 --> 00:18:52.827
What the fuck. Dez?

198
00:18:54.655 --> 00:18:56.091
I love this country.

199
00:18:57.005 --> 00:18:58.049
I love it.Let'’s go.

200
00:18:59.225 --> 00:19:00.835
Someone call the police.Mmm.

201
00:19:28.123 --> 00:19:29.429
Concussion?

202
00:19:30.473 --> 00:19:32.345
No.
you'’re just stupid.

203
00:19:34.564 --> 00:19:36.436
Why do you live
in this shithole?

204
00:19:37.654 --> 00:19:40.309
Well. you find me
a cheaper place.
and I'’ll live there.

205
00:19:41.092 --> 00:19:42.398
Any breaks?

206
00:19:43.269 --> 00:19:44.618
Nah.

207
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.535
Shit.

208
00:19:48.578 --> 00:19:50.014
We'’re on deck in 50.

209
00:19:50.058 --> 00:19:51.799
"Oh. we'’re on deck in 50."

210
00:19:52.843 --> 00:19:54.889
You like my accent?

211
00:19:54.932 --> 00:19:56.499
It'’s about as good
as you look.

212
00:19:56.543 --> 00:19:58.371
You don'’t gotta go.

213
00:19:58.414 --> 00:20:00.155
No. no. no. no.Dez...

214
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.645
Dez.

215
00:20:17.303 --> 00:20:18.652
This is the worst idea.

216
00:20:20.044 --> 00:20:21.481
You think too much.

217
00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.841
Why the hell
did you start a fight
in a cop bar?

218
00:22:02.103 --> 00:22:03.800
They'’re never gonna
let us back in there.

219
00:22:04.497 --> 00:22:05.541
Mmm.

220
00:22:05.585 --> 00:22:06.977
I want an answer.

221
00:22:08.675 --> 00:22:10.546
Maybe '’cause
I almost was one.

222
00:22:11.721 --> 00:22:13.027
One of what?

223
00:22:15.421 --> 00:22:17.379
I always wanted
to be a cop.

224
00:22:17.423 --> 00:22:18.467
Bullshit.

225
00:22:18.989 --> 00:22:20.382
No lie.

226
00:22:20.991 --> 00:22:23.124
Nearly broke
my dad'’s heart.

227
00:22:23.167 --> 00:22:25.692
Not exactly
a law-abiding citizen.

228
00:22:27.128 --> 00:22:28.129
And what happened?

229
00:22:28.825 --> 00:22:30.479
Well...

230
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.699
I. uh.

231
00:22:33.526 --> 00:22:35.789
didn'’t exactly
make it through
the department interview.

232
00:22:35.832 --> 00:22:39.967
Mmm.Yeah. they said
my moral compass

233
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.665
was skewed or whatever.

234
00:22:43.449 --> 00:22:44.754
You?

235
00:22:47.061 --> 00:22:49.063
Yeah.
I was this close. but...

236
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.066
Yeah. I still wanted
to do some good.
you know?

237
00:22:52.632 --> 00:22:55.243
EMT life. baby.

238
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.640
Probably doing more good
than those assholes. anyway.

239
00:23:02.337 --> 00:23:04.774
There are some good cops.
Like. most are good.

240
00:23:05.906 --> 00:23:07.951
Oh yeah? Well. you'll have
to introduce me to one.

241
00:23:10.519 --> 00:23:11.781
Maybe.

242
00:23:16.177 --> 00:23:18.179
I. uh. think I started
that fight.

243
00:23:18.222 --> 00:23:20.224
Well. first of all.
I didn'’t start the fight.

244
00:23:20.268 --> 00:23:23.140
Mmm. Okay.I was defending myself.
which is a big difference.

245
00:23:23.184 --> 00:23:24.054
Sure.

246
00:23:26.317 --> 00:23:27.928
I don'’t know.
I guess I just wanted to see

247
00:23:27.971 --> 00:23:30.931
how tough the LAPD
really was. you know?

248
00:23:30.974 --> 00:23:32.106
You'’re crazy.

249
00:23:33.107 --> 00:23:35.109
Oh.
and you'’re adorable.

250
00:23:35.152 --> 00:23:36.806
-Don'’t call me that.

251
00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:38.678
Ever.

252
00:23:38.721 --> 00:23:39.983
Yes. ma'’am.

253
00:23:43.509 --> 00:23:46.468
This was
a one-time thing.

254
00:23:46.512 --> 00:23:48.470
Oh. okay.
It'’s a one-time thing

255
00:23:48.514 --> 00:23:50.733
and then it'’s a--
until it'’s a two-time thing.

256
00:23:50.777 --> 00:23:53.083
And then it'’s
a three-time thing. okay?

257
00:23:53.127 --> 00:23:54.433
And then it'’s
a four-time thing.

258
00:23:54.476 --> 00:23:55.825
You think
you'’re so charming.

259
00:24:29.816 --> 00:24:31.470
Get the Narcan.
Stay with us.

260
00:26:28.108 --> 00:26:29.239
Did Kyle shove you?

261
00:26:29.892 --> 00:26:31.590
What did I say?

262
00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:34.462
If someone shoves you.
you punch '’em.

263
00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:36.812
If they pull a knife.
you pull a gun.

264
00:26:36.856 --> 00:26:39.859
If they bring a tank.
call me. All right?

265
00:26:40.773 --> 00:26:42.426
Kyle.
Get over here.

266
00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:45.604
Get up.

267
00:26:47.649 --> 00:26:49.259
You'’ve been pushing him
around again?

268
00:26:51.131 --> 00:26:53.655
Milton.
you know what to do.

269
00:26:53.699 --> 00:26:54.743
Go on.

270
00:26:56.702 --> 00:26:58.007
Shake hands.

271
00:27:00.662 --> 00:27:01.663
All good?

272
00:27:02.142 --> 00:27:03.186
Go on.

273
00:27:08.104 --> 00:27:10.324
What did I say to you
about slouching?

274
00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.332
Easy on the spread.
it has to last a month.

275
00:27:18.375 --> 00:27:19.855
Mmm.

276
00:27:22.118 --> 00:27:25.426
You know. your mother
would turn in her grave
if she saw the world now.

277
00:27:26.383 --> 00:27:28.385
This isn'’t the country
it once was.

278
00:27:29.517 --> 00:27:32.085
Small miracles.
that'’s all we can hope for.

279
00:27:33.303 --> 00:27:35.218
You know. every gang
in Long Beach is trying

280
00:27:35.262 --> 00:27:37.177
to get their hands
on those kids.

281
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.266
We feed them.
get tutors for them.

282
00:27:39.832 --> 00:27:41.224
This shelter.

283
00:27:42.051 --> 00:27:43.662
it'’s a legacy.

284
00:27:43.705 --> 00:27:47.970
As long as it stays open.
her memory will last.

285
00:27:49.798 --> 00:27:52.061
Mom would be proud
of you. Dad.

286
00:27:52.105 --> 00:27:55.674
Yeah. well.
pride isn'’t a luxury
I-- I can afford. you know?

287
00:27:58.459 --> 00:28:00.896
Takes all my strength
to keep the lights on here.

288
00:28:03.638 --> 00:28:04.813
We'’ve been defunded.

289
00:28:05.945 --> 00:28:08.121
Yeah.
Budget cuts.

290
00:28:08.164 --> 00:28:10.689
that'’s what they say.
because of the riots last year.

291
00:28:11.994 --> 00:28:13.909
The state doesn'’t get it.
you know?

292
00:28:13.953 --> 00:28:15.868
Save a kid.
you save the future.

293
00:28:20.916 --> 00:28:22.962
Anyway.
I got to get to business.

294
00:28:23.005 --> 00:28:24.528
Um. do you want me
to tell the kids

295
00:28:24.572 --> 00:28:25.791
-the youth center'’s closed?
-No.

296
00:28:25.834 --> 00:28:27.444
I invited them.

297
00:28:28.837 --> 00:28:31.710
They'’re gonna help
with creative ways
to keep the lights on.

298
00:28:37.628 --> 00:28:39.761
Come on. buddy.

299
00:28:39.805 --> 00:28:41.415
Everything in your life

300
00:28:41.458 --> 00:28:43.373
has been leading up
to this moment.

301
00:28:44.505 --> 00:28:46.202
It'’s the opinion
of the department

302
00:28:46.246 --> 00:28:48.248
that why someone enters
law enforcement

303
00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:51.468
is as important
as the work they do
on a daily basis.

304
00:28:51.512 --> 00:28:53.296
Why do I wanna be a cop?

305
00:28:57.605 --> 00:28:58.867
I like doughnuts.

306
00:29:00.521 --> 00:29:01.565
Gun fights.

307
00:29:02.828 --> 00:29:04.960
-Car chases.
-Okay. okay.

308
00:29:05.004 --> 00:29:07.006
This isn'’t
your first time
in here.

309
00:29:07.049 --> 00:29:08.442
That'’s right.

310
00:29:08.485 --> 00:29:11.227
But this is a safe space.

311
00:29:11.271 --> 00:29:13.577
You were given a second chance
after New York.

312
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:17.190
and we need to make sure
you don'’t slip
into your old cowboy ways.

313
00:29:20.062 --> 00:29:22.673
I can'’t tell your captain
that you'’re safe to go back
on the streets

314
00:29:22.717 --> 00:29:24.937
unless I know you'’re not
a danger to yourself
or others.

315
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.765
that'’s bottom line.

316
00:29:27.722 --> 00:29:30.681
Look.
I gave my statement.

317
00:29:32.205 --> 00:29:33.510
It was a good shooting.

318
00:29:43.433 --> 00:29:44.913
I feel better.

319
00:29:44.957 --> 00:29:46.523
Tell me the truth.

320
00:29:46.567 --> 00:29:48.438
Why do you wanna be a cop?

321
00:29:50.745 --> 00:29:52.965
I want my daughter
to be safe.

322
00:29:55.881 --> 00:29:57.056
To be proud of me.

323
00:29:59.232 --> 00:30:02.757
Now your father.
he was a bank manager
in Newark.

324
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:04.933
Can you just tell me
a little bit about him?

325
00:30:04.977 --> 00:30:07.806
He was shot during
an attempted robbery.
is that right?

326
00:30:11.722 --> 00:30:12.811
We'’re done.

327
00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:28.391
Dezi? Dezi? Report to the
supervisor office.

328
00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.412
Boss?

329
00:30:49.456 --> 00:30:50.718
Dezi. take a seat.

330
00:30:55.941 --> 00:30:58.160
I got a witness from
the Beston Bank robbery

331
00:30:58.204 --> 00:31:01.294
that says you refused
to offer medical assistance.

332
00:31:02.817 --> 00:31:03.862
Triage.

333
00:31:05.037 --> 00:31:06.647
This isn'’t a war zone.

334
00:31:07.953 --> 00:31:11.391
Would you rather me
save the villain
or the victim?

335
00:31:11.434 --> 00:31:12.958
I read your report.

336
00:31:13.001 --> 00:31:15.438
Yes. We arrived
on the scene. right?

337
00:31:15.482 --> 00:31:17.658
We went past the dead cop.

338
00:31:17.701 --> 00:31:20.922
I made a judgment call.
and then we went
into the manager'’s office.

339
00:31:20.966 --> 00:31:23.794
You broke protocol
carrying him out like that.

340
00:31:23.838 --> 00:31:26.275
I saved the guy'’s life.

341
00:31:26.319 --> 00:31:30.236
He'’s suing the city and you
for emotional trauma

342
00:31:30.279 --> 00:31:33.195
sustained during
emergency transportation.

343
00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:36.372
-Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:31:39.723 --> 00:31:41.682
-You'’re suspended.
-What?

345
00:31:41.725 --> 00:31:43.379
Dezi.I did nothing wrong.

346
00:31:43.423 --> 00:31:44.772
Take a few weeks.

347
00:31:44.815 --> 00:31:46.861
Let legal come
to a resolution.

348
00:31:47.775 --> 00:31:49.211
it'’ll blow over.

349
00:31:49.255 --> 00:31:52.432
That'’s not fucking fair!

350
00:31:52.475 --> 00:31:54.695
You think you can talk
to me like this?

351
00:31:56.436 --> 00:31:57.480
Fuck it.

352
00:31:58.177 --> 00:32:00.483
You'’re fired
for insubordination

353
00:32:00.527 --> 00:32:03.965
and refusing
to offer medical assistance
to someone in need.

354
00:32:04.009 --> 00:32:07.273
You can'’t fire me.Your contract
is terminated now.

355
00:32:07.316 --> 00:32:10.450
You can'’t fire me.
because I'’m the best fucking
para you fucking got.

356
00:32:13.844 --> 00:32:16.630
You fire me. and you hurt
the whole fucking city.

357
00:32:16.673 --> 00:32:17.979
Big fucking whoop.

358
00:32:18.023 --> 00:32:19.589
Get out of my office.

359
00:33:20.476 --> 00:33:22.696
Right now.
we live in a society

360
00:33:22.739 --> 00:33:26.134
where there'’s one rule for us.
and another rule for them.

361
00:33:26.178 --> 00:33:30.312
That'’s not just here.
That'’s all over the world.
That'’s spreading right now.

362
00:33:30.356 --> 00:33:31.661
That'’s the pandemic.

363
00:33:34.099 --> 00:33:37.580
We are not judged. people.

364
00:33:37.624 --> 00:33:41.106
The rich. the famous.
all of them.
they have their agenda.

365
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:44.152
They decide what'’s right
and what'’s wrong.

366
00:33:44.196 --> 00:33:45.719
But we know what'’s right.

367
00:33:46.937 --> 00:33:48.374
We know what'’s right.

368
00:33:51.768 --> 00:33:53.901
You see Portland?

369
00:33:53.944 --> 00:33:57.209
The world is gonna look
exactly like Portland

370
00:33:57.252 --> 00:33:59.124
if we don'’t have heroes.

371
00:33:59.167 --> 00:34:01.343
The world needs heroes.

372
00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:07.088
Cops have
the hardest job in the world.

373
00:34:07.132 --> 00:34:09.743
This city
is tearing itself apart.

374
00:34:09.786 --> 00:34:13.138
and cops are our last line
of defense.

375
00:34:17.577 --> 00:34:19.970
We need cops
who don'’t care
about red tape.

376
00:34:20.014 --> 00:34:22.451
Who don'’t care
about the politics

377
00:34:22.495 --> 00:34:27.108
and who'’s
gonna become mayor
or a four-year term limit.

378
00:34:27.152 --> 00:34:29.154
Defund the police?

379
00:34:29.197 --> 00:34:33.027
Right. yeah.
sure. great idea.

380
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:35.160
Defund the police.
and then see who comes
to the rescue

381
00:34:35.203 --> 00:34:37.640
when cartels
are running free.

382
00:34:37.684 --> 00:34:41.122
When you can'’t
even get a cup of coffee
without getting mugged.

383
00:34:46.345 --> 00:34:50.131
Who cares about
how people go to jail?

384
00:34:50.175 --> 00:34:53.439
You will never see
all the good things
that the cops do.

385
00:34:53.482 --> 00:34:58.270
You will never see them
breaking up
domestic violence incidents.

386
00:34:58.313 --> 00:35:02.448
organizing. uh. food drives.
because that'’s
not good content.

387
00:35:09.498 --> 00:35:11.152
Defund it. yeah.

388
00:35:11.196 --> 00:35:12.371
Cool. I'’ll wait.

389
00:39:28.583 --> 00:39:31.151
Hey Boots. come here.

390
00:39:31.891 --> 00:39:34.241
What have you got going on
the morning of the Fourth?

391
00:39:34.284 --> 00:39:36.112
I'’m headed to the beach
with my girl. sir.

392
00:39:36.156 --> 00:39:37.636
I'’ve been looking forward
to it all week.

393
00:39:39.072 --> 00:39:42.423
We're looking for volunteers
for the At-Risk Shelter.

394
00:39:42.467 --> 00:39:46.688
Setting up. you know food.
cleaning. you know.Yeah.

395
00:39:48.908 --> 00:39:50.649
I can'’t force you
to say yes.

396
00:39:52.302 --> 00:39:54.783
But I can tell the sergeant
that you declined.

397
00:39:56.568 --> 00:39:59.222
I would love to.
but we'’ve been planning this
for a month.

398
00:39:59.266 --> 00:40:01.616
I got to pick her mom up
at the airport.

399
00:40:06.752 --> 00:40:08.057
Fine. Give it to me.

400
00:40:11.757 --> 00:40:14.107
Serve and protect.

401
00:40:16.457 --> 00:40:18.416
Well.
this is me serving.

402
00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:21.593
I'’m gonna need you
to protect me

403
00:40:21.636 --> 00:40:22.811
from my girlfriend.

404
00:40:23.725 --> 00:40:24.857
Thank you.

405
00:40:25.814 --> 00:40:27.033
You think I'’m kidding.

406
00:40:36.956 --> 00:40:40.829
But I ask this.
"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"

407
00:40:40.873 --> 00:40:42.570
Who watches the watchers?

408
00:40:43.658 --> 00:40:45.007
Answer:

409
00:40:45.051 --> 00:40:46.835
Too many people.

410
00:40:46.879 --> 00:40:48.620
Police can'’t effectively uh.

411
00:40:48.663 --> 00:40:50.491
do their job
with this level of scrutiny

412
00:40:50.535 --> 00:40:52.624
from the media
and. uh. the public.

413
00:40:52.667 --> 00:40:56.366
I say cops don'’t do enough.

414
00:40:59.021 --> 00:41:01.546
They need a ghost.
someone that can
take out the trash

415
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:04.200
and doesn'’t have to worry
about the red tape.

416
00:41:04.244 --> 00:41:06.376
I'’m not talking about.
uh. a vigilante.

417
00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:07.987
I'’m talking more of a...

418
00:41:12.339 --> 00:41:13.688
Angel of Justice.

419
00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:20.303
...vigilante.
I'’m talking more
of a...

420
00:41:20.347 --> 00:41:21.740
Angel of Justice.

421
00:41:21.783 --> 00:41:23.132
Angel of Justice.

422
00:41:23.176 --> 00:41:24.612
Angel of Justice.

423
00:41:24.656 --> 00:41:26.614
Justice. Justice.
Justice.

424
00:41:26.658 --> 00:41:29.791
Justice. Justice. Justice.

425
00:41:29.835 --> 00:41:31.227
Angel of Justice.

426
00:41:43.892 --> 00:41:47.156
Knight! My office. now.

427
00:41:52.771 --> 00:41:54.555
Hey. boss.Shut up.

428
00:41:54.599 --> 00:41:55.861
Yes. ma'’am.

429
00:41:58.124 --> 00:41:59.952
What are you working?Paperwork.

430
00:41:59.995 --> 00:42:01.780
No thanks to you.

431
00:42:01.823 --> 00:42:04.173
Good. Here'’s some more.

432
00:42:04.217 --> 00:42:07.046
Someone stole a uniform.
badge. gun--

433
00:42:07.089 --> 00:42:08.830
the whole shebang--
from the coroner'’s office

434
00:42:08.874 --> 00:42:10.571
down at North Roads Hospital.

435
00:42:11.267 --> 00:42:12.878
Family wants the badge back.

436
00:42:12.921 --> 00:42:15.141
IA wants the gun
and I want to know

437
00:42:15.184 --> 00:42:18.100
what kind of degenerate
would do such a thing.

438
00:42:18.144 --> 00:42:20.625
-No security cameras?
-Nope. no.

439
00:42:20.668 --> 00:42:22.757
Privacy reasons.Privacy?

440
00:42:22.801 --> 00:42:25.020
The customers are dead.

441
00:42:25.064 --> 00:42:27.545
That means you'’re gonna have
to do a little leg work.

442
00:42:27.588 --> 00:42:30.939
And by the looks of things.
you could do with getting
in some more steps.

443
00:42:30.983 --> 00:42:32.288
Ouch.

444
00:42:32.332 --> 00:42:34.073
Just calling it like I see it.

445
00:42:35.988 --> 00:42:37.555
You sleeping all right?

446
00:42:37.598 --> 00:42:39.426
Ah. thank you
for noticing.

447
00:42:39.469 --> 00:42:41.036
It was a late night.

448
00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.603
Narcotics Unit intercepted

449
00:42:42.647 --> 00:42:45.606
a couple of tons of coke
and some women.

450
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:48.130
-Cartel shit?
-Oh. they wish.

451
00:42:48.174 --> 00:42:49.784
No. it was the Vampos Gang.

452
00:42:49.828 --> 00:42:52.134
I guess all the names
were-- were taken.

453
00:42:54.136 --> 00:42:58.227
Oh hey. congrats on the divorce.

454
00:42:58.271 --> 00:43:02.014
I'’m a free man.Yeah. well. uh.
your ring finger may be free.

455
00:43:02.057 --> 00:43:04.103
but your ass still belongs
to the department.

456
00:43:05.234 --> 00:43:06.279
Mmm.

457
00:43:07.715 --> 00:43:09.282
Don'’t I know it.

458
00:43:10.022 --> 00:43:11.371
How'’s your daughter?

459
00:43:12.546 --> 00:43:14.243
She'’s fine.Uh...

460
00:43:14.287 --> 00:43:17.029
Fine is not the F word
I would use

461
00:43:17.072 --> 00:43:18.465
to describe your daughter.

462
00:43:19.422 --> 00:43:21.773
But then again hey.
I mean she'’s got
a dad like you

463
00:43:21.816 --> 00:43:23.252
and a mom like Camilla.

464
00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:27.648
A shrink could diagnose
those daddy issues
three states away.

465
00:43:27.692 --> 00:43:29.737
Did somebody piss
in your coffee?

466
00:43:29.781 --> 00:43:31.913
I'’m just saying

467
00:43:31.957 --> 00:43:36.265
that there'’s a way
to balance out work
and home life.

468
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:39.747
How many husbands have you had?I didn'’t say I knew
how to balance it out.

469
00:43:39.791 --> 00:43:42.271
I'’m just saying there is a way.

470
00:43:42.315 --> 00:43:44.143
You know. I mean look at Fitz.

471
00:43:44.186 --> 00:43:45.492
Fitz is a good boy.

472
00:43:45.535 --> 00:43:46.667
He'’s whipped.

473
00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.887
That is true.

474
00:43:50.018 --> 00:43:51.367
He'’s a good cop though.

475
00:43:51.411 --> 00:43:53.021
What makes you say that?

476
00:43:53.065 --> 00:43:54.893
There'’s none finer.

477
00:43:54.936 --> 00:43:56.590
No. I'’m-- I'm curious now.

478
00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.811
What do you think makes
a good cop?

479
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:05.773
A good cop doesn'’t sleep well.
so everyone else can.

480
00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:08.167
I'’ll accept that.

481
00:44:10.256 --> 00:44:12.301
Oh. ah. one last thing.

482
00:44:12.345 --> 00:44:13.955
You and Fitz are working
the Fourth.

483
00:44:15.087 --> 00:44:16.523
I'’m going camping.

484
00:44:16.566 --> 00:44:17.872
Camping?

485
00:44:18.656 --> 00:44:20.005
Yeah. I got a cabin.

486
00:44:20.048 --> 00:44:23.051
Uh. that'’s not camping.

487
00:44:23.095 --> 00:44:25.010
Not unless
I get time off.

488
00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:26.794
The Fourth?

489
00:44:28.013 --> 00:44:29.884
That'’s my favorite day.

490
00:44:29.928 --> 00:44:32.017
And I expect you
to protect and serve

491
00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:33.671
with a smile on your face.

492
00:44:35.107 --> 00:44:36.369
Thank you. Knight.

493
00:44:55.954 --> 00:45:00.741
Pensions are
our specialty. Your future
is safe. I bank here.

494
00:45:00.785 --> 00:45:03.396
Set up an account
so we can get you
some nice compound interest

495
00:45:03.439 --> 00:45:05.877
or maybe an investment account
would be better for you.

496
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.270
How much do you--
Investment account?
Okay. that'’s fine.

497
00:45:08.314 --> 00:45:10.969
Officer.
What can I do for you?

498
00:45:11.012 --> 00:45:13.406
I. uh...

499
00:45:16.844 --> 00:45:18.846
Are you here
to do a 6-8-9?

500
00:45:19.847 --> 00:45:21.631
Yes. Yeah.

501
00:45:21.675 --> 00:45:22.937
Miss Gakowski.

502
00:45:22.981 --> 00:45:24.156
The officer...

503
00:45:24.199 --> 00:45:25.853
...wants to do a 6-8-9.

504
00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:30.902
Are you okay. Officer?

505
00:45:32.991 --> 00:45:34.732
Your uniform looks
kind of wonky.

506
00:45:35.645 --> 00:45:38.561
Call the union.
The department should not
be sending you out like that.

507
00:45:40.781 --> 00:45:44.176
Do I know you?
Were you here that night
those tweaker assholes

508
00:45:44.219 --> 00:45:45.394
made a run at my vault?

509
00:45:46.395 --> 00:45:49.007
Yeah. I mean.
I-- I heard about that.

510
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:52.358
My ass was almost cooked.
but you boys saved my life.

511
00:45:52.401 --> 00:45:54.969
I'’m sure those paramedics
did a good job. too.

512
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:58.712
It was the blue bloods
and the doctors
at Saint Mary'’s.

513
00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:00.279
They'’re the heroes.

514
00:46:03.456 --> 00:46:04.849
Are you part
of the 14th?

515
00:46:07.155 --> 00:46:10.855
I have a guy whose father
used to be the night commander.

516
00:46:10.898 --> 00:46:11.943
James Jayne?

517
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.423
Oh. yeah. sure.

518
00:46:14.467 --> 00:46:15.642
You know him?

519
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:17.775
Yeah.

520
00:46:18.471 --> 00:46:19.515
Good man.

521
00:46:20.081 --> 00:46:21.082
I thought he died.

522
00:46:21.126 --> 00:46:22.301
Well. you know...

523
00:46:23.868 --> 00:46:25.043
cops never die.

524
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:28.568
Amen. brother.

525
00:46:28.611 --> 00:46:30.439
Blue lives never die.

526
00:46:30.483 --> 00:46:32.833
Thank you
for what you do.

527
00:46:32.877 --> 00:46:34.704
So. do you have any plans
for the Fourth?

528
00:46:34.748 --> 00:46:37.011
Ah. you know.
uh. the usual.

529
00:46:37.055 --> 00:46:39.405
Ah. yeah.
work never ceases.

530
00:46:39.448 --> 00:46:42.974
I can relate.
I will be here
toiling away.

531
00:46:43.539 --> 00:46:44.845
But I love it.

532
00:46:44.889 --> 00:46:46.281
There'’s nothing
more American

533
00:46:46.325 --> 00:46:48.588
than making money
on the Fourth.

534
00:46:56.901 --> 00:46:59.120
Jesus Christ.

535
00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:01.079
Come on.Sir.

536
00:47:20.533 --> 00:47:21.577
Have at it.

537
00:47:34.764 --> 00:47:35.853
Yeah.

538
00:47:38.638 --> 00:47:41.510
We'’ve been defunded.

539
00:47:41.554 --> 00:47:43.904
Takes all my strength
to keep the lights on here.

540
00:47:47.342 --> 00:47:48.561
Go. go. go.

541
00:47:50.389 --> 00:47:53.218
Everybody down!
Down on the ground!

542
00:47:54.959 --> 00:47:56.351
Get down!
Oh. my God!

543
00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:08.059
-You. back to the register
right now!
-William. hang-- hang on.

544
00:48:08.102 --> 00:48:09.625
Let'’s go. let's go!

545
00:48:16.154 --> 00:48:17.590
Let'’s go!
Empty the register!

546
00:48:24.858 --> 00:48:26.904
Fucking vault'’s open.
I'’m going for it.

547
00:48:32.997 --> 00:48:34.128
Stay down!

548
00:48:41.483 --> 00:48:43.746
Let'’s go.
Stay on the ground.
You. against the wall!

549
00:48:44.443 --> 00:48:45.661
Get your head down!

550
00:48:47.011 --> 00:48:48.664
Let'’s go.
Stay on the fucking ground!

551
00:48:50.057 --> 00:48:53.843
Shit! Ah! Fuck!
You all right?

552
00:48:53.887 --> 00:48:55.106
I said no vault!

553
00:48:55.845 --> 00:48:57.325
Look at all
this fucking cash!

554
00:48:57.369 --> 00:48:58.805
I'’m fucking shot. dude.

555
00:48:58.848 --> 00:49:00.720
Well. then hurry
the fuck up and help me.

556
00:49:00.763 --> 00:49:03.070
Fuck you!
You greedy fuck.

557
00:49:03.114 --> 00:49:05.812
You wanna fucking
get out of here.
get the fucking money. Fuck!

558
00:49:16.649 --> 00:49:19.478
Don'’t fucking move.
No cell phones. nothing.

559
00:49:19.521 --> 00:49:21.871
Nobody move.
I'’ll take that.
Thank you very much.

560
00:49:23.656 --> 00:49:26.398
Fuck it. Let'’s go. you cry baby.
-Goddamn it!

561
00:49:44.894 --> 00:49:46.287
Damn.

562
00:49:46.331 --> 00:49:47.462
Stay down!

563
00:49:56.123 --> 00:49:58.517
This shelter.
it'’s a legacy.

564
00:49:59.039 --> 00:50:03.130
As long as it stays open.
her memory will last.

565
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.005
All clear.

566
00:50:09.876 --> 00:50:10.920
Good man.

567
00:50:31.289 --> 00:50:33.378
Officer! Officer.
please. you have to help me!

568
00:50:33.421 --> 00:50:35.423
You have
to help me.Um--

569
00:50:35.467 --> 00:50:36.859
You have to help me.
Please. my husband.
He'’s--

570
00:50:36.903 --> 00:50:38.122
No. I'’m not a. uh--Officer!

571
00:50:38.165 --> 00:50:39.210
No. I'’m off-duty.

572
00:50:39.775 --> 00:50:41.603
What?
What kind of cop
are you?

573
00:50:41.647 --> 00:50:44.041
Okay. I need you to--
I need you to calm down.

574
00:50:44.084 --> 00:50:45.346
Huh?

575
00:50:47.261 --> 00:50:48.306
Um...

576
00:50:50.047 --> 00:50:52.397
Okay. look.
I need you to calm down.

577
00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.485
Okay?

578
00:50:55.269 --> 00:50:57.054
Where is he?He'’s over here.

579
00:50:57.619 --> 00:50:58.664
Okay.

580
00:51:02.668 --> 00:51:04.104
He'’s here.
He'’s over here.

581
00:51:04.148 --> 00:51:06.063
They'’re over there.
Over here.

582
00:51:11.677 --> 00:51:14.245
You'’re weak...

583
00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:23.080
Hands up!

584
00:51:25.343 --> 00:51:26.866
Yeah. hands!

585
00:51:32.045 --> 00:51:33.046
Go.

586
00:51:33.612 --> 00:51:34.656
Get out of here!

587
00:51:35.788 --> 00:51:37.224
Now.
hands against the wall.

588
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:40.053
Now!

589
00:51:44.188 --> 00:51:46.015
All right.

590
00:51:46.059 --> 00:51:47.060
Now. spread '’em.

591
00:51:48.192 --> 00:51:52.239
All right.
now you all have the right

592
00:51:53.414 --> 00:51:54.720
to remain silent.

593
00:51:55.938 --> 00:51:57.157
And anything...

594
00:51:58.202 --> 00:51:59.203
What'’s this?

595
00:51:59.855 --> 00:52:01.814
This? Huh?

596
00:52:05.383 --> 00:52:09.561
...you say
will be used against you

597
00:52:09.604 --> 00:52:10.953
in the court of law.

598
00:52:17.351 --> 00:52:20.746
-That'’s it.
Kick his ass.
-Yeah. kick his ass.

599
00:52:32.236 --> 00:52:33.237
No.

600
00:52:34.063 --> 00:52:35.369
No. no.

601
00:52:37.937 --> 00:52:40.679
Uh. all right.

602
00:52:40.722 --> 00:52:41.984
Oh. no.

603
00:52:45.249 --> 00:52:49.166
This is what happens
when you do not show respect.

604
00:52:51.211 --> 00:52:53.344
I am an officer
of the law.

605
00:52:58.044 --> 00:52:59.263
Okay. get on your knees.

606
00:53:00.786 --> 00:53:02.701
Get on your knees
and kiss the ground!

607
00:53:02.744 --> 00:53:04.050
Kiss the ground.

608
00:53:04.616 --> 00:53:05.878
Kiss it!

609
00:53:06.792 --> 00:53:08.228
Comply and you'’ll survive.

610
00:53:08.794 --> 00:53:09.838
Okay.

611
00:53:11.405 --> 00:53:12.493
No.

612
00:53:20.197 --> 00:53:22.460
I mean. answer me this.

613
00:53:22.503 --> 00:53:26.246
You guys think the world
would be a better place

614
00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:27.552
without you in it?

615
00:53:27.595 --> 00:53:28.640
Huh?

616
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:30.685
I mean.
what do you do?

617
00:53:30.729 --> 00:53:32.644
No. man. No. No.

618
00:53:32.687 --> 00:53:34.907
Make this country better
than it was yesterday.

619
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:40.391
I got your answer
right here.

620
00:53:52.141 --> 00:53:57.669
If they had had complied.
they would have been alive.

621
00:54:26.828 --> 00:54:28.308
Hello?

622
00:54:28.352 --> 00:54:29.570
Who is it?

623
00:54:33.008 --> 00:54:35.533
You won'’t believe
the day I fucking had.

624
00:54:36.925 --> 00:54:37.970
What happened?

625
00:54:47.414 --> 00:54:49.068
Some guy dressed up
as a cop

626
00:54:49.111 --> 00:54:50.722
shot four guys
in Van Nuys.

627
00:54:51.549 --> 00:54:52.593
Not one made it.

628
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.467
Did they find
the shooter?

629
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:58.295
Not yet.
But they will.

630
00:54:58.338 --> 00:55:00.297
I mean.
guy was dressed up as a cop

631
00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:02.908
acting like
he was gonna arrest them.

632
00:55:02.951 --> 00:55:05.258
The police don'’t know shit
about his motive.

633
00:55:05.302 --> 00:55:06.303
Damn.

634
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.785
It isn'’t fair.

635
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:15.529
Well.
maybe it'’ll keep the cops
on their toes.

636
00:55:17.096 --> 00:55:18.402
Shake things up a bit.

637
00:55:21.056 --> 00:55:22.406
Don'’t say that. man.

638
00:55:24.103 --> 00:55:25.147
Why?

639
00:55:26.671 --> 00:55:28.412
Oh. you think they care
about us?

640
00:55:29.935 --> 00:55:32.633
The sons pay
for the sins
of their fathers.

641
00:55:32.677 --> 00:55:33.982
Nothing'’s changed.

642
00:55:35.114 --> 00:55:36.158
Okay?

643
00:55:36.898 --> 00:55:38.683
My father taught me that.

644
00:55:38.726 --> 00:55:41.250
I remember the day
that I told him
I wanted to be a cop.

645
00:55:41.294 --> 00:55:43.949
And he gave me
the biggest backhand
of my life.

646
00:55:43.992 --> 00:55:45.864
and knocked me down
on the floor.

647
00:55:48.519 --> 00:55:52.044
Told me the cops
are our enemies.

648
00:55:52.653 --> 00:55:56.091
And. uh. you know.
they'’re just pigs.

649
00:55:57.832 --> 00:56:02.968
Descendants from slave owners
who prosecuted runaway slaves.

650
00:56:03.011 --> 00:56:06.493
Like the War of Independence.
uh. that'’s for
this country'’s taxes

651
00:56:06.537 --> 00:56:09.975
and the American Civil War.
well. that'’s like.

652
00:56:10.018 --> 00:56:13.935
you know.
they freed the slaves.
but no one'’s really free.

653
00:56:13.979 --> 00:56:15.546
We'’re not free.

654
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:17.548
We--
We'’ll never be free.

655
00:56:19.245 --> 00:56:23.902
Doesn'’t matter who we are.
they'’ll sell us the same
fucking American dream.

656
00:56:23.945 --> 00:56:27.296
And it'’s sad.
It-- It'’s so sad.

657
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.820
It'’s just--

658
00:56:28.863 --> 00:56:30.430
It'’s about money.

659
00:56:30.474 --> 00:56:34.173
And guys like.
what. Sean Beston?

660
00:56:34.216 --> 00:56:37.089
You know. he'’s--
he'’s just a--
He'’s a slave owner.

661
00:56:38.525 --> 00:56:39.570
And the cops?

662
00:56:40.832 --> 00:56:41.920
His goons.

663
00:56:43.312 --> 00:56:45.010
I'’m sorry
you feel that way.

664
00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:46.925
Yeah.

665
00:56:47.621 --> 00:56:49.057
It is what it is.

666
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:55.760
I-- I thought
I got over this
a long time ago.

667
00:57:03.681 --> 00:57:04.725
See you.

668
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:51.337
Vinny.
where'’s the fucking money?

669
00:57:52.294 --> 00:57:55.210
Who'’s this guy?
Didn'’t know
he'’s a fucking cop.

670
00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:00.259
No son of mine
is a cop.

671
00:58:01.173 --> 00:58:02.653
What the fuck
you wearing. son?

672
00:58:04.219 --> 00:58:06.700
It'’s not the uniform
that makes the man.

673
00:58:06.744 --> 00:58:08.528
The man that makes
his own luck.

674
00:58:08.572 --> 00:58:11.096
Don'’t throw
my fucking words
back in my face.

675
00:58:12.227 --> 00:58:14.665
Halloween is next October.

676
00:58:14.708 --> 00:58:15.927
You can dress up then.

677
00:58:16.971 --> 00:58:18.016
You want to help?

678
00:58:19.017 --> 00:58:20.497
Start with meal prep.

679
00:58:21.193 --> 00:58:22.237
Well...

680
00:58:23.978 --> 00:58:25.458
we can change the world.

681
00:58:28.417 --> 00:58:32.726
I mean. cops.
they lock up kids every day.
but this?

682
00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:34.206
This is real.

683
00:58:34.467 --> 00:58:37.949
This shelter stops kids
from becoming these two.

684
00:58:38.993 --> 00:58:40.212
This is our chance.

685
00:58:42.388 --> 00:58:43.955
How long before the. uh--

686
00:58:43.998 --> 00:58:45.957
the lights go out
in this place for good?

687
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.525
Where there'’s a will.
there'’s a way.

688
00:58:48.568 --> 00:58:50.004
I'’m talking
about real action.

689
00:58:51.092 --> 00:58:53.747
You know? A real way
to make change.

690
00:58:54.879 --> 00:58:56.924
Maybe your new associates
can help.

691
00:58:58.491 --> 00:58:59.536
Go on.

692
00:59:01.538 --> 00:59:04.410
Beston Bank and Trust.

693
00:59:04.976 --> 00:59:05.977
What about it?

694
00:59:07.239 --> 00:59:10.938
Their security system.
it'’s all over the place.

695
00:59:10.982 --> 00:59:12.549
The guards.
they'’re arrogant.

696
00:59:12.592 --> 00:59:15.073
I-- I can get us in.

697
00:59:15.595 --> 00:59:16.640
So?

698
00:59:22.602 --> 00:59:23.603
We hit it.

699
00:59:27.825 --> 00:59:29.217
When you look outside.

700
00:59:29.261 --> 00:59:32.307
I mean. do you see
the American dream.

701
00:59:32.351 --> 00:59:33.831
or do you see
someone else'’s?

702
00:59:34.962 --> 00:59:38.270
Embarrass the city
and make some cheese?

703
00:59:39.619 --> 00:59:41.012
I can fuck with that.

704
00:59:48.759 --> 00:59:51.065
We live in a society
where there is nothing

705
00:59:52.458 --> 00:59:54.460
more American
than making money

706
00:59:55.548 --> 00:59:57.115
on the Fourth of July.

707
01:00:12.478 --> 01:00:14.872
Casey Rhodes should
be rotting in jail.

708
01:00:14.915 --> 01:00:16.874
Could you be positive
for once?

709
01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:19.659
Hey. I'’m a fountain
of good vibes.
brother Knight.

710
01:00:21.356 --> 01:00:26.274
If it isn'’t dumb and dumber.
Barney Rubble and this caveman.

711
01:00:26.318 --> 01:00:27.711
What'’s his name again?

712
01:00:27.972 --> 01:00:30.191
Can'’t believe you forgot
Fred'’s name.

713
01:00:33.804 --> 01:00:35.544
Come on.
we'’re on soft duty.

714
01:00:36.415 --> 01:00:40.506
-That isn'’t real.
-Ah. soft duty
is one beer above hard duty.

715
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:42.116
and three below "let'’s party."

716
01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.683
Fucking degenerates.

717
01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:45.467
One of you should be in jail.

718
01:00:45.511 --> 01:00:46.904
and the other in the chair.

719
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.862
Have you got a problem?

720
01:00:48.906 --> 01:00:51.735
If I did.
what would you do?

721
01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:04.878
Happy Fourth.

722
01:01:04.922 --> 01:01:05.966
Yeah.

723
01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:08.316
Thank you. douche bags.

724
01:01:12.451 --> 01:01:13.495
Shit!

725
01:01:14.627 --> 01:01:16.716
I'’ll meet you in the car.

726
01:01:26.334 --> 01:01:29.337
All right. let'’s do this.

727
01:01:29.947 --> 01:01:30.948
You ready?

728
01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:37.171
You lucky son of a bitch.

729
01:01:38.042 --> 01:01:40.697
One time I'’d rather
still be in the chair.

730
01:01:44.265 --> 01:01:45.310
Hey!

731
01:01:46.354 --> 01:01:47.747
You guys know you'’re going
to jail

732
01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:49.140
for the rest
of your lives. right?

733
01:01:49.183 --> 01:01:50.576
Well. I--

734
01:01:52.839 --> 01:01:54.058
All right.
I'’m just playing.

735
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.234
All right.
what do you got here?

736
01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:57.626
What is that.
a Roman candle?

737
01:01:58.236 --> 01:01:59.846
Let me see that thing.

738
01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:03.458
Listen.
if you guys are gonna
light these off...

739
01:02:03.502 --> 01:02:06.200
...you gotta be safe
about it.

740
01:02:06.853 --> 01:02:09.900
-Because you could do
some real damage

741
01:02:09.943 --> 01:02:11.945
with one of these things.
You understand?

742
01:02:11.989 --> 01:02:13.991
I want you to point '’em
in the air.

743
01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:16.645
Not at people.
not at animals.
not at dogs.

744
01:02:16.689 --> 01:02:19.518
You understand?
If I see you pointing this
at a dog.

745
01:02:19.561 --> 01:02:22.086
I'’m gonna curb stomp you
in front of your grandmother.

746
01:02:22.129 --> 01:02:24.218
Do you understand?
All right. good.

747
01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.190
Oh. Mmm.

748
01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.585
Whoo!Yes?

749
01:02:43.629 --> 01:02:45.674
Did you speak with her?

750
01:02:45.936 --> 01:02:48.329
She will reach out
whenever she'’s ready
to talk to you.

751
01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:52.072
Just want to make sure
that she'’s okay.

752
01:02:52.116 --> 01:02:53.813
Just tell me
where she'’s living.

753
01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:55.902
She'’s got a boyfriend. I--

754
01:02:55.946 --> 01:02:58.122
What? Who?

755
01:02:58.165 --> 01:03:02.561
Oh. don'’t go
all super-dad now.

756
01:03:03.127 --> 01:03:04.911
If not now. when?

757
01:03:05.738 --> 01:03:07.000
How'’s the new guy?

758
01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:09.524
You don'’t get
to ask questions like that.

759
01:03:09.568 --> 01:03:11.048
I'’m just saying.

760
01:03:12.658 --> 01:03:15.400
You can do better.

761
01:03:15.443 --> 01:03:19.056
If he treats you right.
I'’ll support that.

762
01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:25.540
All I want is for you
and our girl
to be happy and safe.

763
01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:28.456
That'’s all.

764
01:03:29.631 --> 01:03:33.897
Do you think we. uh.
could have. uh. ever worked?

765
01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:36.377
You put the job first.

766
01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:38.858
And I'’m not blaming you.
I'’m not.

767
01:03:39.467 --> 01:03:40.860
Just the hours.

768
01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:42.819
It was no way
to raise a family.

769
01:03:47.693 --> 01:03:51.871
We were like.
uh. ships passing
through the night.

770
01:03:51.915 --> 01:03:53.046
Yeah.

771
01:03:53.699 --> 01:03:56.267
Yeah. we were going
for the same--

772
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:57.834
Yeah. the same iceberg.

773
01:03:59.139 --> 01:04:00.837
Hey. did you give her the bear?

774
01:04:02.186 --> 01:04:03.840
When I see her.
I will.

775
01:04:04.928 --> 01:04:06.799
Happy Fourth. Detective.

776
01:04:14.111 --> 01:04:15.764
Hey. honey.Hi.

777
01:04:22.771 --> 01:04:24.861
Dad'’s been trying
to get a hold of you.

778
01:04:24.904 --> 01:04:25.862
Why?

779
01:04:26.688 --> 01:04:27.951
He'’s your father.

780
01:04:30.475 --> 01:04:33.739
And fathers do care about
the well-being
of their children.

781
01:04:34.435 --> 01:04:35.784
Occasionally.

782
01:04:42.052 --> 01:04:44.097
He'’s sorry he missed
your birthday.

783
01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:47.927
Yeah. and didn'’t he get me
this exact same one
last year?

784
01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:50.016
You'’re his little princess.

785
01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.800
Whatever.

786
01:04:52.932 --> 01:04:54.325
Thank you.

787
01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:06.641
Okay. Oh.

788
01:05:06.685 --> 01:05:09.035
You are
your father'’s child.

789
01:05:09.079 --> 01:05:11.559
Mm-hmm.You happy now?

790
01:05:11.603 --> 01:05:13.518
Yeah. three more of those
and I will be.

791
01:05:13.561 --> 01:05:18.566
Mm-hmm.
And nice of you
to dress up. too.

792
01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.352
I'’m on call.

793
01:05:25.225 --> 01:05:26.531
Wanna do shots?

794
01:05:28.402 --> 01:05:29.447
No.

795
01:05:30.143 --> 01:05:32.580
These are Mike'’s work friends.

796
01:05:32.624 --> 01:05:34.408
Oh. yeah.Mm-hmm.

797
01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:36.193
We wouldn'’t want
to embarrass him.

798
01:05:36.236 --> 01:05:37.585
Mm-mmm.

799
01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:42.677
Okay.

800
01:05:45.245 --> 01:05:46.768
To being a problem child.

801
01:05:46.812 --> 01:05:48.205
Oh. no.

802
01:05:48.248 --> 01:05:49.858
To good parenting.

803
01:05:55.255 --> 01:05:56.996
Mm-mmm. mm-mmm.Oh.

804
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.824
Oh. Why did you
make me do that?

805
01:05:58.867 --> 01:06:00.173
That'’s so good.No.

806
01:06:00.217 --> 01:06:01.392
Yeah.No.

807
01:06:01.914 --> 01:06:03.220
Go. Mom. Go. Mom.

808
01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:04.308
Yeah!

809
01:06:56.969 --> 01:06:58.536
Happy Fourth. Officer.
Happy Fourth.

810
01:06:58.579 --> 01:07:00.233
-Indeed.
-What can I do for you?

811
01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:03.062
I'’m here to do a 6-8-9.

812
01:07:03.976 --> 01:07:05.456
Well.
we'’ve never been better.

813
01:07:06.152 --> 01:07:07.719
Well. I. um--

814
01:07:07.762 --> 01:07:09.155
I'’m just here
to check up on you. sir.

815
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:13.072
Well. that'’s very kind of you.
But all is well. All is well.

816
01:07:13.116 --> 01:07:16.162
You'’d be doing me a favor
if you let me inside.
so I can see for myself.

817
01:07:16.206 --> 01:07:18.251
What are you doing?
Oh. you!
Hey. there'’s two back there!

818
01:07:18.295 --> 01:07:20.384
-Fucker--
-Want to let me inside?

819
01:07:20.427 --> 01:07:22.603
Fucker! Stay back!

820
01:07:22.647 --> 01:07:24.388
Stay back.
you motherfuckers!

821
01:07:25.911 --> 01:07:27.260
Drop it. drop it.

822
01:07:27.304 --> 01:07:28.696
Get back!

823
01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.394
Put your weapons down!

824
01:07:30.437 --> 01:07:32.048
Back! Get--

825
01:07:32.091 --> 01:07:33.266
Open it up.

826
01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.052
Open up! Open it up!

827
01:07:44.712 --> 01:07:48.629
I am about to live
my American dream.

828
01:07:50.588 --> 01:07:52.720
Mr. Beston.
please stay where you are.

829
01:07:52.764 --> 01:07:55.288
Guards. put down your guns.
You'’re free to go.

830
01:08:07.822 --> 01:08:08.954
Fuck it!

831
01:08:19.225 --> 01:08:20.835
You'’re fucking crazy.

832
01:08:22.054 --> 01:08:23.534
Do you remember me?

833
01:08:23.577 --> 01:08:25.492
Tell me who I am.

834
01:08:27.059 --> 01:08:29.017
Tell me who I am.

835
01:08:30.018 --> 01:08:31.803
Tell me who I am!

836
01:08:40.333 --> 01:08:42.118
Still don'’t. huh?

837
01:09:07.795 --> 01:09:10.929
Silent alarm triggered

Alvarado.

843
01:09:25.944 --> 01:09:28.338
Scared the little bastards.

844
01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.080
Too old
for this shit.

845
01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:36.084
All units. all units.

846
01:09:36.128 --> 01:09:39.131

Hey. boy scout.

of our new friend?

854
01:11:01.387 --> 01:11:02.823
Yeah. I just got
to the location now.

855
01:11:02.867 --> 01:11:04.303
Everything looks
pretty normal.

856
01:11:05.696 --> 01:11:07.306
Hey. gentlemen!

857
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:09.613
Christ.
I'’m having déjà vu.

858
01:11:09.656 --> 01:11:11.702
Witnesses said
they saw three guys go
in here.

859
01:11:11.745 --> 01:11:12.833
One was dressed
as a cop.

860
01:11:33.245 --> 01:11:34.638
We going in or what?

861
01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:38.555
Oh shit! Take cover!

Yeah. shots fired.
Shots fired.

We need cars.
Need your fucking cars

Shots fired!

865
01:12:00.011 --> 01:12:01.578

Shit!
Then hold them back. man!

01:14:12.883 --> 01:14:16.277
-Officer down!
-Get him out!

877
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:48.701
I can'’t see dick
in here.

878
01:15:13.683 --> 01:15:15.423
Shit.

879
01:15:17.164 --> 01:15:18.601
Where the fuck are they?

880
01:15:22.953 --> 01:15:24.781
All right.
someone take the roof.

881
01:15:25.477 --> 01:15:26.652
Move! Let'’s go!

882
01:15:32.658 --> 01:15:34.747
Get the fuck down!
Down on the ground!

883
01:15:34.791 --> 01:15:36.575
On the ground.
Don'’t fucking move.

884
01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:38.055
Check the exit.

885
01:15:39.404 --> 01:15:40.753
Come on!

886
01:15:42.233 --> 01:15:44.583
No. Drop the goddamn money!Ally. Ally.
You have to calm down.

887
01:15:44.627 --> 01:15:46.759
No. I have to go
in there!You'’re safe. You'll be fine.

888
01:15:48.892 --> 01:15:49.936
Let'’s go.

889
01:15:54.332 --> 01:15:56.377
Ah. perfect.
Fucking love it.

890
01:15:56.421 --> 01:15:57.640
Yes!

891
01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:12.524
There'’s the fuckers.

892
01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:13.699
Ally. What--

893
01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.658
What do you mean?
What about her?

894
01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:17.007
Let'’s go.

895
01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:21.620
Oh. shit.

896
01:16:21.664 --> 01:16:23.535
This isn'’t gonna
be good.

897
01:16:26.407 --> 01:16:29.062
Suspect has stolen
a Jesuit Medical ambulance.

898
01:16:29.106 --> 01:16:31.151
Heading southbound
on Imperial Highway.

899
01:16:31.195 --> 01:16:32.718
They have a hostage.

900
01:16:32.762 --> 01:16:34.764
I repeat.
they have a hostage.

901
01:16:36.983 --> 01:16:39.203
Ally. it'’s fine.
Just please calm down.

902
01:16:39.246 --> 01:16:40.465
Please.

903
01:16:40.508 --> 01:16:42.728
What? No.
What is happening?

904
01:16:42.772 --> 01:16:44.295
Who are
those two guys?

905
01:16:44.338 --> 01:16:46.340
Please just calm down.

906
01:16:55.306 --> 01:16:57.700
Hey. Dezi.
we'’ve got incoming.

907
01:17:01.268 --> 01:17:03.619
Let'’s head to the hills.
We can lose them
in the canyons.

908
01:17:03.662 --> 01:17:04.881
Fuck this
fucking ambulance!

909
01:17:04.924 --> 01:17:06.404
Slowest fucking ambulance--

910
01:17:06.447 --> 01:17:09.494
Come on. baby. Come on!
Come on. come on!

911
01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:41.047
Knight.
close the goddamn door!

912
01:17:52.015 --> 01:17:53.712
Get down
and close the door.

913
01:17:53.756 --> 01:17:55.453
You could hit Ally
with that aim.

914
01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:58.891
Where did you learn
to drive?

915
01:17:58.935 --> 01:18:00.763
You.
Now hold on.

916
01:18:01.981 --> 01:18:04.767
They'’re right on us. mate!
Do something!

917
01:18:09.075 --> 01:18:09.989
Christ.

918
01:18:13.123 --> 01:18:15.212
Fucking kill him.
Dezi. Kill him!

919
01:18:25.222 --> 01:18:26.702
Whoa!

920
01:18:35.058 --> 01:18:36.842
Holy shit!

921
01:18:39.802 --> 01:18:41.455
We'’re coming up
on them now.

922
01:18:57.733 --> 01:18:59.430
What the fuck?

923
01:18:59.473 --> 01:19:01.649
Come on. baby.
Come on! Come on!

924
01:19:01.693 --> 01:19:04.696
-Hey. do you hear that?
-Hear what. you fuck?

925
01:19:14.619 --> 01:19:17.796
Oh shit! Look. paparazzi!
Paparazzi!

926
01:19:19.102 --> 01:19:20.973
Paparazzi.
Blue paparazzi.

927
01:19:21.017 --> 01:19:23.149
We'’re gonna
be famous. Nico. Famous!

928
01:19:23.193 --> 01:19:26.022
Hey bro.
that ain'’t TMZ.
That ain'’t TMZ. bro.

929
01:19:30.287 --> 01:19:33.507
Swinging back around.
Going for danger plot.

930
01:19:33.551 --> 01:19:35.596
And I'’m shooting
the back cab.

931
01:19:36.554 --> 01:19:39.775
Shoot '’em!
Nico. get the fucking copter
and kill it.

932
01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:45.084
-I can shoot him.
-Then fucking
shoot him. mate.

933
01:19:51.525 --> 01:19:53.919
Fuck. this is
some serious GTA shit. bro!

934
01:19:53.963 --> 01:19:54.964
Whoo!

935
01:19:55.703 --> 01:19:57.053
Come back around.

936
01:19:57.096 --> 01:19:58.794
Go back around.
Go back around.

937
01:20:09.065 --> 01:20:11.371
What did I say
about that door?

938
01:20:19.727 --> 01:20:21.817
Get '’em. Nico.
Shoot. shoot. shoot!

939
01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:24.776
Fucking shoot
this fuck!

940
01:20:33.785 --> 01:20:35.308
Oh. fuck. Nico.
You all right?

941
01:20:35.352 --> 01:20:37.441
Come here. Nico!

942
01:20:38.094 --> 01:20:39.573
Shit!

943
01:20:48.495 --> 01:20:50.019
Keep it steady.

944
01:20:59.593 --> 01:21:01.421
That little shit
hit the tire.

945
01:21:02.205 --> 01:21:03.946
Now'’s our chance
while he reloads.

946
01:21:03.989 --> 01:21:05.338
Keep it steady.

947
01:21:18.047 --> 01:21:19.091
Shit. Shit.

948
01:21:19.135 --> 01:21:20.223
Hurry up!

949
01:21:20.266 --> 01:21:22.355
This tire'’s fading fast.

950
01:21:22.399 --> 01:21:25.184
I got you.
Now. go get your daughter.

951
01:21:46.553 --> 01:21:47.903
Dezi! Dezi!

952
01:21:47.946 --> 01:21:49.600
How'’d that old fuck
get in here?

953
01:21:49.643 --> 01:21:50.906
Motherfucker.

954
01:21:56.694 --> 01:21:58.783
Don'’t do it.
old man.

955
01:22:38.127 --> 01:22:42.783
-Get out of here!

956
01:23:41.929 --> 01:23:44.280
Yo. yo. you all right?
Holy shit!

957
01:23:45.977 --> 01:23:47.892
Get back.
He'’s got a gun!

958
01:23:52.114 --> 01:23:53.289
Stay back!

959
01:23:53.332 --> 01:23:54.377
Stay back!

960
01:24:11.568 --> 01:24:14.092
Stay back! Stay back.
you motherfuckers!

961
01:24:14.136 --> 01:24:15.311
I'’ll kill all of you.

962
01:24:36.941 --> 01:24:38.377
All right.
cover the field.

963
01:24:38.421 --> 01:24:40.031
Let'’s go around back.
Quick!

964
01:25:09.408 --> 01:25:10.583
Dad!

965
01:25:14.413 --> 01:25:17.242
Dad? Oh.
this keeps getting
fucking better.

966
01:25:21.942 --> 01:25:24.162
Drop the fucking gun!

967
01:25:28.862 --> 01:25:31.126
Shoot this fucking asshole.

968
01:25:40.961 --> 01:25:42.093
Let her go.

969
01:25:44.965 --> 01:25:46.706
I said. let her go.

970
01:25:49.187 --> 01:25:51.798
It wasn'’t supposed
to be like this!

971
01:25:53.887 --> 01:25:57.456
I gave everything I had
to this country.

972
01:25:58.370 --> 01:26:01.286
I tried playing by the rules.

973
01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:03.201
and look where
it fucking got me.

974
01:26:05.421 --> 01:26:06.726
You think that?

975
01:26:09.033 --> 01:26:12.993
You'’re brainwashed
if you think
I'’m the bad guy.

976
01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.345
They don'’t pay me
to judge.

977
01:26:17.302 --> 01:26:21.001
No. You'’re just a sicario
with a badge.

978
01:26:21.045 --> 01:26:23.526
You shoot anyone
they tell you to.

979
01:26:23.569 --> 01:26:26.224
The government?
The government--

980
01:26:26.268 --> 01:26:28.618
The government
is the biggest gang
in town.

981
01:26:29.488 --> 01:26:31.142
Put the gun down.

982
01:26:33.927 --> 01:26:36.408
I would'’ve been the best cop
this city has ever had.

983
01:26:36.452 --> 01:26:39.803
You'’ve got no right
to wear that uniform.

984
01:26:40.978 --> 01:26:43.415
The badge. it doesn'’t--

985
01:26:44.155 --> 01:26:45.722
it doesn'’t make the man.

986
01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:50.770
You don'’t think
I could'’ve been a good cop.

987
01:26:50.814 --> 01:26:53.295
if I just had
a fucking chance?

988
01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:57.124
There'’s no cure
for being an asshole.

989
01:27:01.303 --> 01:27:04.262
All I wanted
was to be the good guy.

990
01:27:07.613 --> 01:27:08.832
That'’s it.

991
01:27:10.355 --> 01:27:12.662
We play the cards
we'’re dealt.

992
01:27:17.623 --> 01:27:21.932
Sometimes we win.
and sometimes we bite it.

993
01:27:21.975 --> 01:27:23.150
Fuck you.

994
01:27:53.746 --> 01:27:55.270
Ally!

995
01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:58.011
I got you.Ally! Please!

996
01:27:58.621 --> 01:28:01.711
Tell them
I'’m a good guy. Tell them.

997
01:28:05.584 --> 01:28:07.107
Ally!

998
01:28:16.203 --> 01:28:17.335
It'’s okay.

999
01:28:19.468 --> 01:28:21.774
I'’m not gonna shoot.
I'’m the good guy.

1000
01:28:22.732 --> 01:28:24.168
I'’m the good guy.

1001
01:28:24.211 --> 01:28:25.256
I'’m the good--

1002
01:28:29.173 --> 01:28:31.393
Happy Fourth. motherfucker!
