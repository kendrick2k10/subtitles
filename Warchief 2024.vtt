3
00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:06.761
My fury is matched only by

4
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:11.474
your patheticness.

5
00:23:12.934 --> 00:23:16.104
This should be a fight.

6
00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:18.940
but you are worthless.

7
00:23:19.232 --> 00:23:22.735
Look at your ears

8
00:23:23.152 --> 00:23:27.406
so flippy-floppy.

9
00:23:34.372 --> 00:23:38.626
You are only worth death.

10
00:23:41.003 --> 00:23:46.300
Even your sniffer comes off easy.

11
00:23:50.304 --> 00:23:53.641
You are not a warrior.

12
00:23:57.645 --> 00:24:03.526
You are a poor plaything even for an Orcling.

13
00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:07.572
This patheticness...

14
00:24:07.989 --> 00:24:11.701
patheticness brings me fury.

15
00:24:15.788 --> 00:24:18.499
I do not come to mercifully

16
00:24:19.584 --> 00:24:23.796
end the lives of the worthless.

17
00:24:24.172 --> 00:24:27.466
I come for the honour of glorious deaths.

18
00:24:28.092 --> 00:24:31.179
so that my people may be rich in plunder.

19
00:24:31.179 --> 00:24:34.348
I come for WAR

20
00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:48.282
War is coming

21
00:31:58.375 --> 00:32:00.711
I smell your blood!

22
00:32:00.711 --> 00:32:03.714
Why do you plague me?

23
00:32:11.472 --> 00:32:14.725
Where do your warriors hide?

24
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:27.696
I come to you now Warshaman.

25
00:32:28.822 --> 00:32:32.242
I have waited.

26
00:32:32.242 --> 00:32:35.663
We felt the Warpath open.

27
00:32:35.663 --> 00:32:39.083
We will move. now we have spoken.

28
00:32:40.334 --> 00:32:43.629
I am still hunting. something is wrong.

29
00:32:44.004 --> 00:32:47.007
My bloodrage was frustration.

30
00:32:47.424 --> 00:32:51.220
Your bloodstone is full.

31
00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:54.890
Otherwise we would not share our thoughts.

32
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.059
kin to kin?

33
00:32:57.059 --> 00:32:59.061
Yes. I am killing. but

34
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:02.564
Few are worthy of your warsword. I know.

35
00:33:02.564 --> 00:33:05.567
Save some for us.

36
00:33:06.068 --> 00:33:10.531
WAR is coming.

37
00:33:17.079 --> 00:33:20.040
Why are so many death-touched here?

38
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.211
You kill my wolf. trap and destroy my wyvern.

39
00:33:24.211 --> 00:33:27.214
yet have nothing for me?

40
00:48:25.528 --> 00:48:30.074
Spirits beckon us. yet the winds warn us. unusual.

41
00:53:44.722 --> 00:53:47.016
Fight.

42
00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:49.685
orcish sign language
(hands up = kill me)

43
00:53:50.102 --> 00:53:52.855
orcish sign language
(hands down = no fight)

44
00:53:52.855 --> 00:53:54.482
What are you doing?

45
00:53:54.774 --> 00:53:56.359
Yes. Fight!

46
00:53:56.943 --> 00:54:01.113
orcish sign language
(hands up = kill me)

47
00:54:01.113 --> 00:54:02.448
Fine.

48
00:54:05.618 --> 00:54:08.329
Come on now. make up your mind.

49
00:54:09.455 --> 00:54:11.791
You are almost intelligent.

50
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:13.501
You act like a goblin.

51
00:54:13.584 --> 00:54:16.170
At least goblins are useful.

52
00:54:16.504 --> 00:54:19.799
There is no honour in this.

53
00:54:19.966 --> 00:54:21.550
Pathetic.

54
00:54:27.056 --> 00:54:28.015
Nor this.

55
00:54:28.099 --> 00:54:30.476
I come for WAR!

56
00:54:53.541 --> 00:54:55.876
I do not come to play with...

57
00:54:55.876 --> 00:54:57.837
Goat's Bladders!

58
00:54:59.046 --> 00:55:00.715
Goblin's Testicals!

59
00:55:00.715 --> 00:55:02.758
Harpie's Scales!

60
00:55:03.092 --> 00:55:06.053
Or spineless ent-huggers!

61
00:55:19.984 --> 00:55:21.610
You are all flippy-floppies.

62
00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:24.113
No spine. No strength.

63
00:55:25.406 --> 00:55:27.908
This is why we came to broker...

64
00:55:28.367 --> 00:55:30.202
Broker peace with you.

65
00:55:31.787 --> 00:55:33.664
You are not worth killing.

66
00:55:33.664 --> 00:55:35.541
But you could be useful.

67
00:55:35.541 --> 00:55:37.126
have purpose

68
00:55:37.376 --> 00:55:38.961
and meaning

69
00:55:40.713 --> 00:55:42.715
in your lives.

70
00:55:46.052 --> 00:55:49.805
But even though we come with

71
00:55:49.805 --> 00:55:52.266
no weapons. you hide.

72
00:55:52.266 --> 00:55:54.185
No-one to talk to.

73
00:55:54.935 --> 00:55:58.189
Search the buildings. I will talk to them.

74
00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:05.029
Do not harm them.

75
00:56:05.029 --> 00:56:09.450
They will serve us like the goblins.

76
00:56:10.367 --> 00:56:14.580
Bring us food. find us metals.

77
00:56:16.707 --> 00:56:20.795
We wanted to let you do useful things. feed us.

78
00:56:34.141 --> 00:56:35.684
But...

79
00:56:35.684 --> 00:56:38.187
then you scream war cry...

80
00:56:39.897 --> 00:56:43.234
and everyone knows. you scream war cry.

81
00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:46.112
we scream war cry.

82
00:56:47.905 --> 00:56:51.367
Battle rage comes. so all must die.

83
00:56:53.869 --> 00:56:55.704
Not good fight.

84
00:56:55.704 --> 00:56:57.331
Too easy.

85
00:57:12.805 --> 00:57:15.182
We swore never to return.

86
00:57:16.225 --> 00:57:18.644
You can never trust a human.

87
00:57:18.644 --> 00:57:21.188
Poor workers. greedy eaters.

88
00:57:21.188 --> 00:57:23.274
Skinny and soft.

89
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.443
But it's now too late.

90
00:57:26.735 --> 00:57:29.947
When my warpack arrives...

91
00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:32.074
We will wipe you out for good.

92
00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:36.328
I have had enough of your nonsense.

93
01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:59.386
War Is Coming

94
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:03.515
War cry. we are near...

95
01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:05.433
Hurry!

96
01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:10.313
Terrible backhand.

97
01:09:52.981 --> 01:09:54.024
More!

98
01:09:54.024 --> 01:09:55.609
Bring me Anger!

99
01:09:55.609 --> 01:09:57.235
Bring me Death!

100
01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:04.427
Good to get my fury up.

101
01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:07.472
You flippy-floppys did good.

102
01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:09.808
I'm even sweating.

103
01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:12.185
An excellent workout.

104
01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.187
Strong forearm.

105
01:11:14.813 --> 01:11:16.523
Still my backhand struggles...

106
01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:18.566
Lack of battle practise. probably.

107
01:15:16.971 --> 01:15:19.849
More killing without me?!

108
01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:14.529
You all have no metal to steal.

109
01:16:15.363 --> 01:16:17.907
No gems for the shaman.

110
01:16:19.867 --> 01:16:22.036
You are cheap pickings.

111
01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:27.125
A workout. yes. but not a real battle.

112
01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:33.256
Finally.

113
01:20:51.055 --> 01:20:53.849
He kneels for his superiors. Good.

114
01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:26.085
He will bring us war?

115
01:23:26.085 --> 01:23:28.295
Humans love revenge.

116
01:25:20.407 --> 01:25:22.034
Excellent backhand.

117
01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:53.148
Heal the blood.

118
01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.946
I shall kill this one too.

119
01:25:58.946 --> 01:26:02.241
orcish sign language
(flat blade up = my kill)

120
01:26:02.241 --> 01:26:05.035
You do not give me orders!

121
01:26:10.457 --> 01:26:13.794
Why can i understand you?

122
01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:20.759
We are linked now.

123
01:27:31.789 --> 01:27:34.541
Did you see my backhand?
