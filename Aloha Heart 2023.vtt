00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:34.889
* Come along to the ...

180
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:39.853
*

181
00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:46.192
* You know that I would do
anything for you *

182
00:08:46.234 --> 00:09:01.124
*

183
00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:01.958

184
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.711
-Oh my gosh.

185
00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:07.005
-I cannot believe
you're getting married here.

186
00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:09.049
-Stunning. Right?

187
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.841
-Wow.

188
00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.593
-Are you talking about me?

189
00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:13.678
[women chuckle]

190
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.513
I have been working out
a little more than usual.

191
00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.307
So... all for you though.

192
00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:20.477
I'll go check us in.

193
00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:23.772
-Oh. I love you. Michael.
You're the best.

194
00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.732
-[Michael] I know. I know.

195
00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:30.445
-Uh... oh...

196
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.447
-I know we've been doing a lot
of band-aid fixes

197
00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:33.907
over the last few years. so...

198
00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.658
I came up with a list
of upgrades. improvements.

199
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.868
all priced out...

200
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.996
-Whoa. whoa. Manu.
Slow down. it's day one.

201
00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:41.331
-As manager.

202
00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:43.875
But I've been... I've been
shadowing Noa forever.

203
00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.252
-Manu. we love your enthusiasm

204
00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:49.923
but now is not the time
to talk improvements.

205
00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:52.676
-We just want you to focus
on getting up to speed.

206
00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:54.344
-I can multi-task.

207
00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:57.138
-Ah. but the guests come first.

208
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.265
-Okay. yeah.

209
00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:02.519
-Can you imagine how
much water it takes to
keep all this so green?

210
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.021
-No.
And neither should you.

211
00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:07.691
It's not like we're
in the high desert.

212
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.693
-Not a good point.

213
00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:15.073
-I know. But... no more work
or work talk this week.

214
00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:15.949
Remember?

215
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.658
-Yeah. yeah.

216
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.951
-You're between jobs.

217
00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.328
-Hmm. not a relaxing thought.

218
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.788
-For. like. a hot minute.

219
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:26.501
So just try and turn off
your beautiful brain

220
00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:30.463
and enjoy doing... nothing.

221
00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:32.632
-Right. Totally gonna try that.
-Good.

222
00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:33.675
[both chuckle]
[cell phone pings]

223
00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:36.594
Oh! Just after this one
quick email.

224
00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.138
Just really fast.
Sorry.

225
00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.139
-Uh huh.

226
00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.851
-Hmm.

227
00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.769
-Welcome to the Hale
Hoaloha resort.

228
00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.146
Would you care for a lei?

229
00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.647
-Yes!

230
00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:49.024
Oh!
[chuckles]

231
00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:52.986
Hi. Uh... thank you for this.
It's very pretty.

232
00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:54.029
-[chuckles]

233
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.572
Would you like some
coconut water?

234
00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:56.823
-Oh no. I'm good.

235
00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:58.700
Oh. but speaking of water.
I am curious.

236
00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:01.369
What are you doing in terms
of recycling?

237
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.996
-The...
I'm sorry. what?

238
00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:04.164
For the...
for the coconut water?

239
00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.832
-Oh. no. No.

240
00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:08.918
I just. I couldn't help but
notice how lush

241
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.339
the gardens and grounds are
and I was curious about

242
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.966
to note what you're doing in
terms of water conservation.

243
00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:18.345
I'm sure it takes a ton
to keep it up.

244
00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.637
-[laughs]

245
00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.639
Well. we are currently
researching improvements

246
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:25.018
that respect the fragile
ecosystems of Hawaii.

247
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.686
-Meaning?

248
00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.313
-You ask a lot of questions
about water.

249
00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:29.439
-Oh. sorry.

250
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:30.857
-[chuckles]

251
00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.025
-Um. you know what? I...
I need to get checked in.

252
00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:33.526
-Oh. I can help you with that.

253
00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:35.487
-Oh!
Oh. you handle check in too.

254
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:37.739
Okay.

255
00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.993
-I'm Manu. one of
the resort managers.

256
00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.037
We run a relatively
small operation

257
00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:45.830
so you'll be seeing a lot of
the same people.

258
00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:49.584
First and last name please.

259
00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.127
-Sarah Gordon.

260
00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:55.924
-Will anyone else
be joining you?

261
00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:57.801
-Well. that's a bit personal.
Don't you think?

262
00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:02.013
-Just asking so I know
how many keys you need.

263
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.766
-Right. Um... just the one
will be fine.

264
00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:10.021
-I have you in room 183.

265
00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.732
You'll find there's a nice view
of the gardens.

266
00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.068
-You still have real keys?

267
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.611
-We... do.

268
00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:18.238
-Oh. no.

269
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.365
I just thought that most hotels
switched that out years ago.

270
00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:21.866
-Oh. well...

271
00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:23.785
some people appreciate
the more vintage.

272
00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:25.495
personal touch of a real key.

273
00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:27.163
-Ah.

274
00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:30.250
-But there's a suggestion box
over there across the lobby.

275
00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:33.545
Feel free to visit it as often
as you like during your stay.

276
00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.880
-I will. Thanks.

[waves crashing on the shore]

283
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.656
I don't understand.
How am I just seeing this?

284
00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.700
-It was last summer. Manu.

285
00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.494
This wasn't something
to concern you with.

286
00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:50.121
-But it is concerning.

287
00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:52.624
-I agree.
We've been doing what we can.

288
00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.626
-But it's clearly not enough.

289
00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:56.378
-For now it has to be.

290
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.174
-Look. they'll be coming back
in three months.

291
00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:03.051
Unannounced.

292
00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:04.844
And it's not just
the rating. okay?

293
00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.514
We have a responsibility
greater than ourselves.

294
00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.015
-We know that.

295
00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:12.310
But you have to remember
that we're not a mega resort.

296
00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:13.937
We can't over-extend

297
00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:16.981
or there'll be no doors to open
for them when they do come back.

298
00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.526
-So you just want me
to ignore it?

299
00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.111
-No. Manu.

300
00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.363
We want you to focus on making
this a warm and authentic stay

301
00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:24.906
for our guests.

302
00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:27.158
Keeping guest satisfaction up

303
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.828
and the aloha spirit
alive on our island.

304
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.539
That's what we want.
That's the job.

305
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.540
-Okay.

306
00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:38.044
-So... let's get ready
for the day.

307
00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:51.474
-Sarah! Sarah! Not good!

308
00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:52.976
Uh. this is so not good.

309
00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:54.519
-What. the coffee?

310
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:56.312
-No.

311
00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:57.605
We lost our venue.

312
00:14:57.647 --> 00:14:58.732
-For the wedding?

313
00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:01.735
-No.
Our rehearsal dinner.

314
00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.319
Okay. technically
we didn't lose it.

315
00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:06.948
since I just discovered I never
hit send on the contract email.

316
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.283
-What did Michael say?

317
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.535
-Nothing.
I haven't told him yet.

318
00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:11.745
-Why?

319
00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:13.079
-'Cause. Well. then
we'll both worry.

320
00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:15.915
and he'll worry about
me worrying

321
00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:17.834
‘cause he knows I want
this week to be perfect.

322
00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:20.754
[gasps]
It has to be perfect.

323
00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:21.671
-Okay. it's gonna be fine.

324
00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:22.672
-It's once in a lifetime.

325
00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:23.673
-It's gonna be fine.
Okay?

326
00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:26.301
Like. we will figure this out.

327
00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:27.886
-How?

328
00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.096
There's no time to figure
this out.

329
00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:32.682
Uncle Lou is going to be here
any minute.

330
00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:34.267
all the way from New York...

331
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:38.438
and we promised him we'd golf
and I don't even golf.

332
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.439
So there's that.

333
00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:41.608
-Okay. okay. Stop.
Deep breaths.

334
00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:45.320
[both inhale and exhale]

335
00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:47.822
Don't worry. Okay?
I've got this. I could do it.

336
00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:49.991
-What. the rehearsal dinner?

337
00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:51.701
-Why do you sound so surprised?

338
00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:53.995
Okay. look... we both know

339
00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:56.581
that I am not the most
experienced Maid of Honor.

340
00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:58.583
but I'm pretty sure
it's my job to help.

341
00:15:58.625 --> 00:15:59.918
-Really?

342
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.336
-Yes. I don't want either
of you to stress.

343
00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:04.214
So just give me a budget
and a headcount

344
00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:07.050
and forget about it. Okay?

345
00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:10.261
Yeah. I've got this.
It's gonna be fun.

346
00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:11.971
-[chuckles]
You're lying.

347
00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:15.225
-Out of love.
Just leave it to me.

348
00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:18.019
-Oh. God.
You're the best!

349
00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:21.022
Thank you!

350
00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:25.026
-Right.

351
00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:29.114
[upbeat cheerful music]

352
00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:34.119
-Hi.

353
00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:35.995
-Hi.

354
00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.706
-Quick question.

355
00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:38.957
-Is it water related?

356
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:41.710
-I wish.
Fixing that would be way easier.

357
00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:44.546
I'm... I'm looking for Alana.
I left her a message but...

358
00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:45.547
-That's me.

359
00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:47.841
-You're Alana?

360
00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.175
-Uh... this week.

361
00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:51.094
Just handling events
for my cousin

362
00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:52.762
while she's at a trade show.

363
00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.556
-Oh. Right.

364
00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.516
Well... Alana...

365
00:16:56.558 --> 00:16:59.102
-Manu.
-Got it.

366
00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:00.729
-Any chance you could help me
plan a rehearsal dinner

367
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:01.855
super quickly?

368
00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:03.398
-For when?

369
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.899
-Friday.

370
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:08.695
-This Friday?
For this wedding?

371
00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:12.615
-Yeah. unfortunately.
A little planning mishap.

372
00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:16.369
Not on your end. not your fault.
just trying to help a bride out.

373
00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:18.329
So if you could point me
in the right direction

374
00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:21.583
or a direction that would
be super helpful.

375
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.759
-That's what I'm here for.

376
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.052
-Really? You have time?

377
00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:34.929
-No. But I'll make it.

378
00:17:34.971 --> 00:17:35.930
Can't have the first wedding
under my watch

379
00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:38.183
not go 100 percent.

380
00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.810
Even if it's not
my mistake to fix.

381
00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.187
-Where do we start?

382
00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:45.231
[sighs]

[adventurous island music]

384
00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:57.744
-Wow.

385
00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:02.415
What did I tell you? You can't
take a bad photo here.

386
00:18:02.457 --> 00:18:05.710
-You know. Michael needs to get
a good shot of this

387
00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.879
because you look super official.

388
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.589
-Smoke and mirrors
are my new best friends.

389
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:11.591
[all chuckle]

390
00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:12.842
-Do you wanna come with us?

391
00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:14.719
-Golfing?

392
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:17.055
Oh. you know what?
Normally I would love to.

393
00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:18.556
Or at least drive the cart.

394
00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:20.058
[all laugh]

395
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.267
But. uh...

396
00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:25.647
-You sure you're okay
doing this?

397
00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.524
-I wouldn't have offered
if I wasn't.

398
00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:28.942
So go! Tee off.

399
00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:30.777
-Thank you.
-Have fun!

400
00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:33.738
-Hey.
-Hey.

401
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.782
-Uh... I already found
one place that's available.

402
00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:38.535
My friend's mom owns it
so I pulled some strings.

403
00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:41.204
It's a...
it's a bit fancy.

404
00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:42.414
-Sounds promising.

405
00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:47.293
Uh. that's our bride.
She's a little stressed.

406
00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:48.712
-I can tell.

407
00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:49.921
-Really?

408
00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.048
-Well. I work in hospitality.

409
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.092
It's my job to understand
people.

410
00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.428
You know. see what's
really going on.

411
00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.471
So I can help.

412
00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:01.266
-I think what would really help
is seeing that one place.

413
00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:02.183
[nervous chuckles]

414
00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:05.437
Is that our ride?

415
00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:09.774
-No. Uh. the one place is
not on the property. so...

416
00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:11.151
we'll take the tour jeep.

417
00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:13.486
-Oh. that uses a lot of gas.

418
00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:17.949
Never mind.

419
00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:21.619
I'll... reserve my questions
for later.

420
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.121
-Alright.
-Okay.

421
00:19:23.163 --> 00:19:24.289

424
00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:39.929
-The restaurant's
a little formal

425
00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:41.473
but it's got great ocean views.

426
00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:42.807
-Sounds nice.

427
00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:43.850
-Yeah. it's just
a starting point.

428
00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:47.687
-How long have you been
in hospitality?

429
00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:49.647
-Since I was seven.

430
00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.316
-That doesn't sound legal.

431
00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:52.650
-[scoffs]

432
00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:54.736
My parents took over this place
when I was seven.

433
00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:56.738
-And you've been there
ever since?

434
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.698
-Yup.

435
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.992
Just working my way up
slowly but surely.

436
00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:04.954
-Wow. I can't even imagine that.

437
00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:09.501
-[scoffs]
Which part?

438
00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.753
Growing up on a resort.
working with your family

439
00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:15.548
or clawing your way up
from seven?

440
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:20.845
-I didn't mean that at all.
but all good questions.

441
00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:22.514
-That's okay.
It's fine.

442
00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:25.892
Uh... I know I'm fortunate.
It's a good gig.

443
00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.358
-[Manu] We're almost there.

444
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.401
-[Sarah] Great.

[cheerful island music]

446
00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:44.994
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

447
00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:50.542
Manu. this is super helpful.
Thank you for arranging this.

448
00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:52.043
-Oh. my pleasure.

449
00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:54.170
-I love that it's all
linen tablecloths.

450
00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:56.923
You know. it feels
very wedding-y.

451
00:20:56.965 --> 00:20:58.049
I'm not sure about the orange

452
00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.718
but I do like the white
tablecloths

453
00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.302
and the bird of paradise.

454
00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:05.432
Yeah. I mean. I feel like I know
exactly what this would be.

455
00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.058
Let's book it!

456
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.852
-What? It's the first place
you've seen.

457
00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:10.854
-Oh. is there a second one?

458
00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:13.064
-Not yet but there will be.

459
00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.066
-Oh. well we don't exactly have
a lot of time

460
00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:18.153
and I need to figure out
the flowers and the music.

461
00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.904
And since I've clearly never

462
00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:21.031
planned anything like
this before.

463
00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:23.033
I think it's best we lock
it down. STAT.

464
00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:26.786
-So. you think it's what
the bride wants?

465
00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:28.830
-Oh. I mean... sure.
Right?

466
00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:30.790
What's not to like?
It's elegant.

467
00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:32.876
It's pricey. but not too pricey.

468
00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:34.878
It's kinda perfect. Right?

469
00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:36.629
Though it is in the city.

470
00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:39.591
-You wanna make it special?

471
00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:41.718
-Well. of course.

472
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.969
-Okay. then it's easy.

473
00:21:44.262 --> 00:21:45.055
-Easy?

474
00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:51.269
-Yeah. You know. just make sure
everything feels personal.

475
00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:52.812
You know. all
the little touches.

476
00:21:52.854 --> 00:21:54.230
the thought you put into them.

477
00:21:54.272 --> 00:21:56.274
That's what makes
something special.

478
00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:59.778
-Thank you for placing
that boulder on my chest.

479
00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:01.112
-[chuckles]
Hey. you asked for my help.

480
00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:03.448
-Technically... Alana's.

481
00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:05.992
You know what?

482
00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:07.243
I'm gonna do a quick check in
with Lydia.

483
00:22:07.285 --> 00:22:09.746
and if she likes it.
I'm booking it.

484
00:22:09.788 --> 00:22:11.998
-Don't stress.
it's gonna be great.

[engine starts]

486
00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:20.465
-What?

487
00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:21.508
-Nothing.

488
00:22:23.426 --> 00:22:24.511
-Nothing?

489
00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:27.180
-Look. I'm trying to. but...

490
00:22:27.222 --> 00:22:28.932
have you ever thought of
switching this out

491
00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:30.642
or do you have
a whole fleet?

492
00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:31.935
-Of what?

493
00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:33.311
-Tour jeeps.

494
00:22:33.353 --> 00:22:35.063
If you do. you might want
to consider electric.

495
00:22:38.108 --> 00:22:41.653
-It costs a lot to bring
cars to the island.

496
00:22:41.695 --> 00:22:44.698
-Right. Flight cost should've
clued me into that. Sorry.

497
00:22:44.739 --> 00:22:47.409
Oh. but better yet. you could
replace them with walking tours.

498
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:48.743
Zero emissions.

499
00:22:48.785 --> 00:22:49.953
-Is this like a twitch?

500
00:22:49.994 --> 00:22:51.913
‘Cause there seems to be
no filter.

501
00:22:51.955 --> 00:22:54.040
-Hazard of the job.

502
00:22:54.082 --> 00:22:56.751
-Hmm. What job?

503
00:22:56.793 --> 00:22:58.378
-Ecologist.

504
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.130
I mean. that's why I studied
everything but I landed in...

505
00:23:00.171 --> 00:23:02.340
-Oh. let me guess.
Water efficiency?

506
00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:05.010
-Ah. You are good
at reading people.

507
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:06.511
-Thank you.

508
00:23:06.553 --> 00:23:08.138
Now may I interest you in
our zero emissions option

509
00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:09.848
for the trip back?

510
00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:11.224
-You do have an option.

511
00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:13.560
Oh. that makes my heart
so much happier.

512
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:14.811
What is it?

513
00:23:17.939 --> 00:23:20.316
Are you suggesting I walk home?

514
00:23:20.358 --> 00:23:23.069
-Just presenting you
with an eco-friendly option.

*

518
00:24:05.445 --> 00:24:07.072
-Thank you.

519
00:24:07.113 --> 00:24:08.990
I know you didn't need
to take me there

520
00:24:09.032 --> 00:24:11.242
so I appreciate it.

521
00:24:11.284 --> 00:24:12.827
-Ah. At least now
you have an option.

522
00:24:14.913 --> 00:24:16.456
-Yeah. I'll get back
to you soon.

523
00:24:16.498 --> 00:24:17.582
-Yeah.

524
00:24:23.213 --> 00:24:26.257
And. just so you know...

525
00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:28.927
when I said I couldn't imagine
your life.

526
00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:31.471
it's just because we moved
around a lot

527
00:24:31.513 --> 00:24:35.308
when I was growing up and now I
travel a ton for work.

528
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:38.103
I just couldn't imagine having
a place like this

529
00:24:38.144 --> 00:24:39.270
to always call home.

530
00:24:42.482 --> 00:24:43.233
-Got it.

531
00:24:44.275 --> 00:24:47.445
And hey. uh...

Yeah. most people think eco-
friendly upgrades is costly

but normally they pay for
themselves or more over time.

You?

creeping in.

introduce you to?

I mean. why not?

I guess I just need
a moment to clean up.

-Oh. no.

916
00:41:57.642 --> 00:41:59.936
Actually I was thinking
tomorrow. if that works?

917
00:41:59.978 --> 00:42:01.396
I've kept you way too long

918
00:42:01.438 --> 00:42:03.773

to take care of here.

And I'm kinda tired.

a lot.

-I did.

988
00:46:18.862 --> 00:46:20.238
But my dad loved sailing

989
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.033
so I always had the water
to anchor me.

of work you do.

to show you

or else it might not
make sense.

At least that's what we call it.

Just far enough away from
the resort where I felt like

1036
00:48:31.411 --> 00:48:36.332
I could adventure. explore.
not think of any of that.

1037
00:48:36.374 --> 00:48:38.293
Don't get me wrong.

anything.

I had to work

1042

just because they owned
the resort.

00:48:54.559 --> 00:48:59.397
It's almost to a fault but
I always wanted to work.

1066
00:50:02.127 --> 00:50:05.005
-Yeah. If you're lucky you might
even spot a sea turtle.

-Ah.

1068
00:50:06.256 --> 00:50:08.633
Well. now that you put it
that way.

Hey Noa.
Have you seen your brother?

1077
00:50:46.671 --> 00:50:48.590
He's not answering his phone.

1078
00:50:48.631 --> 00:50:51.843
-Not since this morning.
Did you try his office?

1079
00:50:51.885 --> 00:50:54.512
-When you see him. can you
tell him to come find us?

over there?

-Yeah.

1084
00:51:15.617 --> 00:51:17.702
-I bet I know exactly
what they were playing.

1085
00:51:17.744 --> 00:51:20.538
Same game we used
to play all the time.

1086
00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:23.083
-It looked like they were
just standing still.

1087
00:51:23.124 --> 00:51:26.086
-They were because the first
person to flinch

1088

when something slimy
touches them... loses.

1089

-Oh... wow.

1090
00:51:29.714 --> 00:51:31.091
That's the game
you used to play?

1091

-Mm-hmm.

-And I always used to say
it's because nothing scared me

1097
00:51:37.722 --> 00:51:39.391
but that wasn't true.

1098

Jellyfish?

1099
00:51:40.475 --> 00:51:41.476
-Nope.

I was sneaking around

1101

1102
00:51:45.313 --> 00:51:46.815

and mean good luck.

they're an aumakua.

are a living canoe

for your toast?

thought. but...

1121

the restaurant is beautiful.
it really is.

1122
00:53:24.913 --> 00:53:29.125
But. you know. it doesn't
really feel like Lydia.

1123
00:53:29.167 --> 00:53:31.836
What they're going for.

1124

But the day we just
had... it does.

1125

It's all about connection.
Right?

1126
00:53:38.843 --> 00:53:41.137
-Yeah. Alright.
well that's pretty easy.

-Yes.

Although music would be
a huge bonus if possible.

00:53:48.728 --> 00:53:51.564
Otherwise I'll just sing.

planned before the mishap

are all you.

00:59:48.505 --> 00:59:50.131
Welcome to the Hale
Hoaloha resort.

1242
00:59:50.173 --> 00:59:51.257
Check in is right this way.
Okay?

1243
00:59:51.299 --> 00:59:53.510
Hey. How's it going. guys?

1244
00:59:53.551 --> 00:59:56.471
I'm coming back for
a reservation. Okay?

1245
01:00:01.184 --> 01:00:04.354
Mom. Dad.
Everything okay?

1246
01:00:06.439 --> 01:00:07.816
-We need to talk.

1247
01:00:11.528 --> 01:00:14.030
-So you knew what was
going on with the pool.

1248
01:00:14.072 --> 01:00:16.991
-I knew there were issues
that needed to be addressed.

1249
01:00:17.033 --> 01:00:19.786
-The saltwater chlorinator
basically imploded.

1250
01:00:19.828 --> 01:00:22.872
We have to get everyone out
and close down the main pool.

1251
01:00:22.914 --> 01:00:25.041
-What? Right now?

1252
01:00:27.085 --> 01:00:28.169
I didn't realize...

1253
01:00:28.211 --> 01:00:29.546
-Kainoa told us that
he warned you

1254
01:00:29.587 --> 01:00:31.506
that we needed to change
the salt cell.

1255
01:00:31.548 --> 01:00:34.509
-He did but I thought
there was more time.

1256
01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:36.094
I was trying to find
a work around

1257
01:00:36.136 --> 01:00:38.680
so we wouldn't have to close...
and one that would be better.

1258
01:00:38.722 --> 01:00:39.472
-For who?

1259
01:00:41.224 --> 01:00:43.268
-The land.

he kauwa ke kanaka.

1261

The land is a chief.
we are its servant.

1262
01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:57.157
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help.

1263
01:00:57.198 --> 01:00:59.993
-Well your help is going
to cost us twice as much.

1264
01:01:01.369 --> 01:01:04.039
Maybe you weren't ready
to move up to manager.

1265
01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:04.998
-Kino.

1266
01:01:06.791 --> 01:01:07.542
-I'm sorry.

1267
01:01:11.004 --> 01:01:12.172
-Let's shut it down.

1268
01:01:16.176 --> 01:01:17.135
-Sorry.

1269
01:01:22.599 --> 01:01:24.225
-[Tessa] Oh. they are going to
be so surprised.

1270
01:01:24.267 --> 01:01:25.101

-I know.

Um... hi.
Excuse me.

1274
01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:37.072
-I'm so sorry. we've had to
temporarily close the pool.

1275
01:01:37.113 --> 01:01:39.574
But we encourage you to utilize
the private beach

1276
01:01:39.616 --> 01:01:42.035
or. uh... the kids pool.

1277
01:01:49.292 --> 01:01:51.252
-Um... why don't we just
go to the beach?

1278
01:01:51.294 --> 01:01:53.046
We'll just tell everyone
to meet up there.

1279
01:01:54.881 --> 01:01:56.216
-I guess.

1280
01:01:56.257 --> 01:01:58.259
-We're working as hard as we can

1281
01:01:58.301 --> 01:02:00.095

before you leave.

I've never given a speech

gratitude when we find it.

that love on.
