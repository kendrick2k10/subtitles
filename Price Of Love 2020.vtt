431
00:23:59.849 --> 00:24:01.923
coming up trying to make detective.

432
00:24:01.923 --> 00:24:04.927
Knocking down doors instead

433
00:24:04.927 --> 00:24:07.445
Waiting in the car. waiting

437
00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.841
- Who is he?

438
00:24:21.841 --> 00:24:25.399
- He is a nobody but who
he works for is a somebody.

439
00:24:25.399 --> 00:24:27.094
You would think that riding around

440
00:24:27.094 --> 00:24:28.409
with $500.000 in your trunk.

441
00:24:28.409 --> 00:24:29.987
you would be getting your dick sucked.

442
00:24:29.987 --> 00:24:31.571
swerving in and out of lanes.

443
00:24:31.571 --> 00:24:36.144
So we had to plan close
there stop him for a DUI.

444
00:24:36.144 --> 00:24:39.173
Comes to find out. he's
about to make a drop.

445
00:24:39.173 --> 00:24:40.752
- To whom?

446
00:24:40.752 --> 00:24:42.547
- I was hoping you could tell me that.

447
00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:43.751
Had two kids on their seat too.

448
00:24:43.751 --> 00:24:45.651
- Where are you holding 'em?

449
00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:46.572
- Let me talk to them.

450
00:24:46.572 --> 00:24:47.989
- Slow your role.

451
00:24:48.839 --> 00:24:51.735
We were holding 'em downtown.

452
00:24:51.735 --> 00:24:55.029
Two days later. he ends up dead.

453
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:56.432
So you know what that means.

454
00:24:56.432 --> 00:24:59.548
- Somebody didn't want him talking.

455
00:24:59.548 --> 00:25:00.677
- Exactly.

456
00:25:00.677 --> 00:25:04.066
My hunch is what got me to
captain and I'm willing to bet

457
00:25:04.066 --> 00:25:06.730
my hunch that this isn't
no small time business.

458
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.133
There's a high roller out there

459
00:25:10.133 --> 00:25:12.383
and I wanna know who he is.

460
00:25:16.406 --> 00:25:19.872
(indistinct)
- Open the fucking mouth

461
00:25:19.872 --> 00:25:22.455

462
00:25:24.733 --> 00:25:25.900
Sam. Sam. Sam.

463
00:25:28.295 --> 00:25:32.919

make shit hard for yourself.

464
00:25:32.919 --> 00:25:33.752
(indistinct)

465
00:25:33.752 --> 00:25:34.851

00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:36.833
- That's not we are gonna do nigga.

467
00:25:36.833 --> 00:25:37.666
I can tolerate a lot of shit

468
00:25:37.666 --> 00:25:40.836
but lying to God ain't one of them.

469
00:25:40.836 --> 00:25:43.939
Fortunately for you. I got shit to do.

470
00:25:43.939 --> 00:25:45.614
So I'm going to ask you one
more motherfucking time.

471
00:25:45.614 --> 00:25:46.656
Where the fuck is my money at?

472
00:25:46.656 --> 00:25:49.906

535
00:28:20.046 --> 00:28:21.504
- I mean I get it.

536
00:28:21.504 --> 00:28:23.442
You got to make your money and sales

537
00:28:23.442 --> 00:28:25.838
especiallY with all these
nasty ass niggas is that it.

538
00:28:25.838 --> 00:28:26.671
(chuckles)

539
00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:29.723
- You know what's funny?
- What's that?

540
00:28:29.723 --> 00:28:31.890
- The fact that here I am.

541
00:28:33.849 --> 00:28:37.932
sitting on your lap. with
my titties in your face

542
00:28:39.013 --> 00:28:40.621
and yet you are still talking

543
00:28:40.621 --> 00:28:44.121
about everybody else outside of this room.

544
00:28:45.036 --> 00:28:47.307
- What the fuck?
- Oh my God.

545
00:28:47.307 --> 00:28:50.403
- Look like she was trying to
but you kept fucking talking.

546
00:28:50.403 --> 00:28:52.533
- Please don't shoot me please.

547
00:28:52.533 --> 00:28:54.616
- I don't care about a bitch.

548
00:28:54.616 --> 00:28:57.461
I could get this bitch to
say please before you could

549
00:28:57.461 --> 00:29:00.200
and you are the one paying her.

550
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.822
Speaking of which run all
your money right the fuck now.

551
00:29:03.822 --> 00:29:05.421
And put your fucking titties away

552
00:29:05.421 --> 00:29:07.838
and get the fuck out of here.

553
00:29:10.516 --> 00:29:12.246
Don't say you ain't got now.

554
00:29:12.246 --> 00:29:16.746
Because I know for a fact
you at least got. two bands.

555
00:29:20.326 --> 00:29:23.659
I'm really not good at repeating myself.

556
00:29:29.882 --> 00:29:31.351
- Then I see your ass no more.

557
00:29:31.351 --> 00:29:34.618
- Or maybe I better
not ever see you again.

558
00:29:34.618 --> 00:29:37.424
(slaps)

559
00:29:37.424 --> 00:29:40.174
(dramatic music)

560
00:30:05.806 --> 00:30:08.417
(Knocks window)

561
00:30:08.417 --> 00:30:11.123
I haven't got no money go away.

562
00:30:11.123 --> 00:30:13.623
(Knocks door)

563
00:30:16.887 --> 00:30:17.720
What the fuck lady?

564
00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.553
I told you I got no fucking money.

565
00:30:23.956 --> 00:30:27.626
Old lady. If you really
think you is about to rob me.

566
00:30:27.626 --> 00:30:30.167
I got another thing for your ass.

567
00:30:30.167 --> 00:30:31.000
- Rob you?

568
00:30:32.109 --> 00:30:36.091
(laughs)
Now see that's funny.

569
00:30:36.091 --> 00:30:38.174
No its you who robbed me?

570
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.155
- Have you ever seen this
gun pointed at your head?

571
00:30:44.155 --> 00:30:45.072
Before now?

572
00:30:46.042 --> 00:30:47.712
(Laughs)

573
00:30:47.712 --> 00:30:50.210
Well then I never fucking robbed you.

574
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.845
- No. you don't never
put a gun to my head.

575
00:30:52.845 --> 00:30:56.225
but you did put a gun to
one of my workers here.

576
00:30:56.225 --> 00:30:59.158
It's a family business transaction I'm on.

577
00:30:59.158 --> 00:31:02.203
Speaking of that man . I
got my niggas right across

578
00:31:02.203 --> 00:31:05.370
the street ready to come and kill you.

579
00:31:06.941 --> 00:31:11.941
If anything was to (laughs)
go wrong between me and you.

580
00:31:15.592 --> 00:31:20.342
So with that being said. can
I have my money back please?

581
00:31:25.635 --> 00:31:27.089
Thank you.

582
00:31:27.089 --> 00:31:29.418
- You could count it if you want.

583
00:31:29.418 --> 00:31:30.251
- I could

584
00:31:31.845 --> 00:31:34.817
But I trust you small fry.

585
00:31:34.817 --> 00:31:36.061
(laughs)

586
00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:38.478
Oh. and just a little advice.

587
00:31:40.545 --> 00:31:41.768
That trick you're doing

588
00:31:41.768 --> 00:31:44.955
is getting a little bit too old honey.

589
00:31:44.955 --> 00:31:47.364
You're going to get yourself killed.

590
00:31:47.364 --> 00:31:48.536
And that stripper.

591
00:31:48.536 --> 00:31:51.776
I mean. I'm assuming she
was in on the whole thing.

592
00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.353
And getting her little cut.

593
00:31:53.353 --> 00:31:55.436
(laughs)

594
00:31:56.733 --> 00:31:57.566
Okay.

595
00:32:00.433 --> 00:32:01.433
I like that.

596
00:32:03.025 --> 00:32:05.192
You're not a snitch bitch.

597
00:32:06.376 --> 00:32:08.059
(laughs)

598
00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:11.634
Well. when you're ready to
make some serious coins?

599
00:32:11.634 --> 00:32:13.634
Come and see me Jasmine.

600
00:32:15.862 --> 00:32:19.136
- Wait. how the fuck do you know my name?

601
00:32:19.136 --> 00:32:21.969
- Wow . you really don't remember?

602
00:32:25.419 --> 00:32:27.336
I mean. you were a kid.

603
00:32:28.554 --> 00:32:30.887
So maybe it's best you don't

604
00:32:31.915 --> 00:32:35.832
But if you wanna know
Jasmine. I will tell you.

605
00:32:39.614 --> 00:32:40.739
- You know I'm proud of you right?

606
00:32:40.739 --> 00:32:42.058
- Definitely.
- No.

607
00:32:42.058 --> 00:32:44.072
Let me get this out.

608
00:32:44.072 --> 00:32:45.937
Listen. you've been busting your ass

609
00:32:45.937 --> 00:32:47.901
to get where you are right now.

610
00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:51.194
And I remember when I first
brought you and your sister in.

611
00:32:51.194 --> 00:32:52.902
And I was over my head.

612
00:32:52.902 --> 00:32:55.606
I wasn't that much older than you.

613
00:32:55.606 --> 00:32:57.103
Right?

614
00:32:57.103 --> 00:32:59.714
I've seen it a million times
what happens when the system

615
00:32:59.714 --> 00:33:01.783
takes away siblings from each other.

616
00:33:01.783 --> 00:33:04.001
And I just didn't want that to happen.

617
00:33:04.001 --> 00:33:07.831
I remember you were so angry all the time.

618
00:33:07.831 --> 00:33:10.998
fighting in school just like every day

619
00:33:11.932 --> 00:33:16.932
and it hurt when I had to
send you to (indistinct).

620
00:33:19.511 --> 00:33:22.501
Tore your sister apart too.

621
00:33:22.501 --> 00:33:25.271
So that's why you come over
here and you tell me all these

622
00:33:25.271 --> 00:33:28.045
big busts you're doing and
you know you are a detective

623
00:33:28.045 --> 00:33:28.878
and all of this man.

624
00:33:28.878 --> 00:33:30.295
I'm proud of you.

625
00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:33.160
Okay?
- Thank you

626
00:33:35.795 --> 00:33:38.462
(glasses clink)

627
00:33:40.921 --> 00:33:42.360
- All right.

628
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.212
How about we stop one of the machines-

629
00:33:44.212 --> 00:33:46.654
- Please-
(laughs)

630
00:33:46.654 --> 00:33:48.652
- Hey man. you are doing
good in your career

631
00:33:48.652 --> 00:33:49.485
and I'm proud of you.

632
00:33:49.485 --> 00:33:50.318
- Thank you.
- All right

633
00:33:50.318 --> 00:33:51.151
How about you tell me
about that love life.

634
00:33:51.151 --> 00:33:52.638
- Don't start with that.
- I'm gonna start.

635
00:33:52.638 --> 00:33:54.710
I'm gonna start that car right on now.

636
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:55.986
What did I always tell you?

637
00:33:55.986 --> 00:33:56.889
A great career--

638
00:33:56.889 --> 00:33:58.997
- [Both] Ain't nothing without
a woman to share it with.

639
00:33:58.997 --> 00:34:01.358
- Hell if you know then talk
to me. now what's going on?

640
00:34:01.358 --> 00:34:03.482
- I mean it will happen
when it's supposed to.

641
00:34:03.482 --> 00:34:04.536
you know simple.

642
00:34:04.536 --> 00:34:06.656
- That's it?
- That's it.

643
00:34:06.656 --> 00:34:10.489
But at least promise me
you'll think about it.

644
00:34:11.787 --> 00:34:13.535
- I will think about it.

645
00:34:13.535 --> 00:34:15.035
- Okay. thank you.

646
00:34:15.936 --> 00:34:17.985
- Now can you tell me
where your sister is?

647
00:34:17.985 --> 00:34:19.913
(door knocks)

648
00:34:19.913 --> 00:34:21.967
- Damn bitch I've been
calling your ass all day.

649
00:34:21.967 --> 00:34:23.820
Do you know what time it is?

650
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.221
- I really don't .

651
00:34:25.221 --> 00:34:26.661
- What time is it

652
00:34:26.661 --> 00:34:28.244
- It's one o'clock.

653
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.306
- Shit. my bad girl.

654
00:34:34.202 --> 00:34:38.162
I did way too much last night
I was smoking and drinking-

655
00:34:38.162 --> 00:34:40.293
- And blah. blah. blah. blah. blah

656
00:34:40.293 --> 00:34:42.330
Look fuck all that bullshit
you are talking about.

657
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:46.180
But that shit last night was perfect.

658
00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.972
And nigga didn't see shit coming.

659
00:34:48.972 --> 00:34:51.167
How much we hit that nigga.

660
00:34:51.167 --> 00:34:52.000
- Nothing.

661
00:34:53.356 --> 00:34:55.813
- Stop playing. how much?

662
00:34:55.813 --> 00:34:56.646
- Nothing.

663
00:34:58.602 --> 00:34:59.698
- Fuck you mean?

664
00:34:59.698 --> 00:35:02.365
- What does nothing mean to you?

665
00:35:03.949 --> 00:35:07.507
- I know what nothing
means but I also know

666
00:35:07.507 --> 00:35:09.277
you put a lot of money in your hands

667
00:35:09.277 --> 00:35:10.861
from the nigga fucking pockets.

668
00:35:10.861 --> 00:35:14.444
So I just know you're
not trying to play me

669
00:35:15.292 --> 00:35:18.209
because then we will have problems.

670
00:35:19.572 --> 00:35:22.720
- You really think that I'd play you?

671
00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.240
You really think I'd
play you of all people?

672
00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.907
- Don't want to fuck
then what the fuck Jas.

673
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:33.493
- Everything was good
till I got to the car

674
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.633
and something happened

675
00:35:38.944 --> 00:35:42.313
so basically you was my mom's pimp?

676
00:35:42.313 --> 00:35:45.230
- No sweetie I was your mom's boss.

677
00:35:49.441 --> 00:35:53.205
- She was fucking men and
giving you money for it.

678
00:35:53.205 --> 00:35:55.686
How's that no a pimp?

679
00:35:55.686 --> 00:36:00.076
- I never asked your moms
do that with those men

680
00:36:00.076 --> 00:36:03.765
Shit back in your mom's prime
she didn't have to do shit.

681
00:36:03.765 --> 00:36:07.938
But she got strong on
that shit. lost her weight

682
00:36:07.938 --> 00:36:12.688
she got sloppy and this type
of business that's not good.

683
00:36:18.647 --> 00:36:20.593
- So what you're telling me is

684
00:36:20.593 --> 00:36:22.226
once she got strung out on drugs

685
00:36:22.226 --> 00:36:24.158
you stopped fucking with her.

686
00:36:24.158 --> 00:36:25.698
And so what you want me to fill her shoes

687
00:36:25.698 --> 00:36:27.281
and take her place?

688
00:36:29.251 --> 00:36:33.417
No old lady you got the
wrong bitch for that.

689
00:36:33.417 --> 00:36:34.500
- Pal
- What?

690
00:36:36.655 --> 00:36:38.072
- My name is Pal.

691
00:36:42.503 --> 00:36:43.586
not old lady.

692
00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:51.804
And you know what. you do have
a choice you know that right?

693
00:36:53.591 --> 00:36:56.829
Because you don't strike
me as the type of bitch

694
00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:59.079
that works 9-5 type of job.

695
00:37:00.234 --> 00:37:03.239
We'll see the difference between you and I

696
00:37:03.239 --> 00:37:05.739
I do it 'cause I like to shit.

697
00:37:08.097 --> 00:37:12.186
I could retire tomorrow on
any island in the world.

698
00:37:12.186 --> 00:37:15.103
and I mean for the rest of my life.

699
00:37:16.161 --> 00:37:20.553
So what I'm telling you
is that you have a choice.

700
00:37:20.553 --> 00:37:25.136
Give me a year. one year you
can make it your own money

701
00:37:28.026 --> 00:37:31.359
so that you can retire by the age of 40.

702
00:37:32.922 --> 00:37:35.589
But once again that's up to you.

703
00:37:39.455 --> 00:37:41.288
Let me see your phone.

704
00:37:44.204 --> 00:37:46.204
Come on don't be so shy.

705
00:37:53.585 --> 00:37:58.585
Dial this number if you ready
to make some serious coins

706
00:37:58.657 --> 00:38:01.490
but if not. then we'll never talk.

707
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.147
But either way Jasmine.

708
00:38:08.355 --> 00:38:12.355
this is the part you get
the fuck out of my car.

709
00:38:15.411 --> 00:38:16.523

00:47:20.872 --> 00:47:23.320
they don't have to do too much at all.

885
00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.085
I mean. of course. they
do have to get physical

886
00:47:26.085 --> 00:47:29.872
from time to time but not all the time.

887
00:47:29.872 --> 00:47:32.122
So do you wanna learn what?

888
00:47:37.285 --> 00:47:38.868
- Great got a name.

889
00:47:40.847 --> 00:47:43.065
You don't even have a
face to go with the name

890
00:47:43.065 --> 00:47:46.951
you don't even have
spot the name hangs out.

891
00:47:46.951 --> 00:47:48.748
Hell. for all we know
this can be a fake guy.

892
00:47:48.748 --> 00:47:50.639
- And if you know me and my tactics.

893
00:47:50.639 --> 00:47:52.556
you know name is solid.

894
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.934
- Oh. even if the name is solid?

saving the head guy.

You do remember who are going after?

897
00:48:00.947 --> 00:48:02.768
- Yes. yes. and if I'm right.

898
00:48:02.768 --> 00:48:05.361
this is the guy right
next to the guy in charge.

899
00:48:05.361 --> 00:48:07.578
All I'm asking is to shake
a few trees just to see

900
00:48:07.578 --> 00:48:09.745

So map it out to me.

00:48:34.323 --> 00:48:38.406
- First move is to find
out who the hell Rill is.

908
00:48:39.868 --> 00:48:42.479
- If you're scared. you
can get the fuck out now.

00:52:23.113 --> 00:52:26.536

982
00:52:27.804 --> 00:52:29.009

- Man fuck that shit.

987
00:52:38.364 --> 00:52:41.047

00:52:57.578 --> 00:52:59.911
(gun fires)

994
00:53:00.811 --> 00:53:01.644
- Call Burns

995
00:53:01.644 --> 00:53:03.405

to clean the trunk out.

996
00:53:03.405 --> 00:53:05.072
- I'm already on it.

997
00:53:10.005 --> 00:53:11.487
(boot door slams)

998
00:53:11.487 --> 00:53:13.277
(dramatic music)

999
00:53:13.277 --> 00:53:17.957
- Well. remember today
just isn't about football.

1000
00:53:17.957 --> 00:53:20.540
It's about growing as young men

1001
00:53:21.804 --> 00:53:25.532
'cause as we know football
is more than just a game

1002
00:53:25.532 --> 00:53:30.032
it's a way of life . pushing
supporting others in life

1003
00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:36.207
same with supporting
the teammates on defense

1004
00:53:36.207 --> 00:53:38.454
being competitive for that next win

1005
00:53:38.454 --> 00:53:42.621
is the same as being
competitive for that next job

1006
00:53:43.997 --> 00:53:48.519
and most important. not
accepting the average game

1007
00:53:48.519 --> 00:53:53.352
is to say was not accepted
average lifestyle for yourself.

1008
00:53:54.581 --> 00:53:58.748
So I say good luck and
congratulations to you all.

1009
00:54:00.249 --> 00:54:02.303
'cause you all winners.

1010
00:54:02.303 --> 00:54:06.970
(players screaming)
Let's hit the field.

1011
00:54:08.614 --> 00:54:09.781

1012
00:54:10.668 --> 00:54:13.529

Follow me.

1014
00:54:24.007 --> 00:54:25.767
- So fine in the spirit with the kids

1015
00:54:25.767 --> 00:54:27.760
but on this real world shit.

1016
00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.654
When I came along with
the top business with you.

1017
00:54:29.654 --> 00:54:31.886
now we are in the locker room.

1018
00:54:31.886 --> 00:54:33.431
- You gotta relax.

1019
00:54:33.431 --> 00:54:36.514
- I'll relax when I see some product.

1020
00:54:38.203 --> 00:54:40.108
- Well you heard him.

1021
00:54:40.108 --> 00:54:44.941

so we can do some business.

1022
00:54:58.885 --> 00:54:59.718

1023
00:55:01.387 --> 00:55:02.387
- Calm down.

1024
00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:28.347
- That's the fuck I'm talking about.

1025
00:55:28.347 --> 00:55:32.847
- You see Ceas there is
always a method to my madness.

1026
00:55:34.758 --> 00:55:38.247
I don't give a fuck about the kids.

1027
00:55:38.247 --> 00:55:40.874
but they make a great fucking alibi.

1028
00:55:40.874 --> 00:55:44.350
And I guess the real question
is right here right now

1029
00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:47.741
I got 500 of them can you handle it?

1030

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:52.057
- Clock start.

1032
00:55:59.499 --> 00:56:02.416

00:56:04.313 --> 00:56:05.313
- I got you.

1034
00:56:09.425 --> 00:56:14.425
(hiphop music)
(indistinct chatter)

1035
00:56:32.037 --> 00:56:36.749
- Well. well. well. don't

00:56:36.749 --> 00:56:37.917

- Hayes is that bitch y'all

01:10:35.872 --> 01:10:37.450

1292
01:10:41.251 --> 01:10:42.084
All right cool.

1293
01:10:42.084 --> 01:10:44.425
Let's get straight to it.

1294
01:10:44.425 --> 01:10:47.194
You recognize this woman?

1295
01:10:47.194 --> 01:10:48.111
Look at it.

1296
01:10:50.855 --> 01:10:52.272
Oh. okay. silent.

01:10:56.736 --> 01:11:00.264
You know why I brought you down here?

1298
01:11:00.264 --> 01:11:02.197
Because I found this
woman wrapped in a blanket

1299
01:11:02.197 --> 01:11:05.625
next to a fucking hotel dumpster.

1300
01:11:05.625 --> 01:11:07.125
Sick motherfucker.

1306
01:11:25.171 --> 01:11:27.593
That you wouldn't respond to shit.

1307
01:11:27.593 --> 01:11:28.676
I'm counting.

1308
01:11:29.998 --> 01:11:32.761
Okay. yeah. I just lost $100 because--

1309
01:11:32.761 --> 01:11:33.594

But guess what?

1314

I don't give a fuck about
you. I want your boss.

1315
01:11:44.391 --> 01:11:48.024

1324
01:12:14.552 --> 01:12:15.969
Fucking dumb ass.

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:21.268
So how about this?

1326

1335
01:13:03.965 --> 01:13:05.446

1336

(giggles)

1451
01:20:58.741 --> 01:21:02.574

1453
01:21:11.726 --> 01:21:14.893
The fact that you took 500K from Drez.

1454
01:21:16.405 --> 01:21:18.473
What are you too fucking stupid

1455
01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:20.923
to get off the country with the money.

1456
01:21:20.923 --> 01:21:24.196
- Rill. I swear on my life. it wasn't me.

1457
01:21:24.196 --> 01:21:25.463
There was this bitch at the hotel man.

1458
01:21:25.463 --> 01:21:29.296

01:21:52.535 --> 01:21:55.452
- Well. sit your a stupid ass down.

1466
01:21:59.861 --> 01:22:02.204
Now I'm gonna ask you one question.

1467
01:22:02.204 --> 01:22:05.455
And I'm only gonna ask you
this shit one time. Tate.

1468
01:22:05.455 --> 01:22:07.371
Do you got the money?

1469
01:22:07.371 --> 01:22:11.371
And if you answer anything
other than yes or no?

1470
01:22:15.346 --> 01:22:17.013
I'm gonna shoot you.

1471
01:22:19.236 --> 01:22:21.486
Now. do you have the money?

1472
01:22:23.959 --> 01:22:25.526

1473
01:22:25.526 --> 01:22:26.359
- Okay.

1474
01:22:28.396 --> 01:22:31.193
Well. pick your cards up.

1475
01:22:31.193 --> 01:22:33.360
Pick the fucking cards up.

1476
01:22:35.422 --> 01:22:37.005
I'm gonna go first.

1477
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:42.812
I'm going to start you off with

1478
01:22:44.633 --> 01:22:49.277
(laughs) a draw fucking four.

1479
01:22:49.277 --> 01:22:51.860
(laughs) Shit.

1480
01:22:55.913 --> 01:22:57.878
That's my bad.

See I forgot to tell you. my
game my rules. you get it.

1482
01:23:02.407 --> 01:23:05.025
My game my rules?
- Yeah.

1483
01:23:05.025 --> 01:23:07.482
- And with that being said.

1484
01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:10.982
a draw four really means. I withdraw four.

1485
01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:17.040
From the trigger.

1486
01:23:18.631 --> 01:23:19.881
Ah look at you.

1487
01:23:21.045 --> 01:23:23.628
What the fuck you dropping for?

1488
01:23:24.996 --> 01:23:27.583
I almost had you there. Tate.

1489
01:23:27.583 --> 01:23:29.471
Now let me cut the bullshit thou.

1490
01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:31.304
now it's time to (indistinct) bitch.

1491
01:23:31.304 --> 01:23:33.471
(gunshot)

1492
01:23:37.710 --> 01:23:41.293
- We got a dead Tate.
and missing $500.000.

1493
01:23:46.861 --> 01:23:50.528
Only lead we got is a
bitch with green hair.

1494
01:23:57.759 --> 01:24:00.926
- Look. bro. that's all he said to me.

1495
01:24:04.188 --> 01:24:08.771
- Well. I guess we got to
find a bitch with green hair.

1496
01:24:13.468 --> 01:24:16.218
Or I have to start asking around.

1497
01:24:19.803 --> 01:24:22.584
But the only problem with that is

1498
01:24:22.584 --> 01:24:27.001
if I got to ask then what
the fuck do I need you for?

1499
01:24:34.844 --> 01:24:36.344
You understand me?

1500
01:24:37.263 --> 01:24:39.346
- Loud and fucking clear.

1501
01:24:49.243 --> 01:24:53.198
Yo. man we need to meet up and talk now.

1502
01:24:53.198 --> 01:24:54.031
All right.

1503
01:24:59.415 --> 01:25:01.024
- What's up baby. you're looking good.

1504
01:25:01.024 --> 01:25:02.379
- Nigga. skip to the fucking point.

1505
01:25:02.379 --> 01:25:05.112
it's cold as shit outside.

1506
01:25:05.112 --> 01:25:06.112
- All right.

1507
01:25:07.570 --> 01:25:10.723
I aint tell you everything.
but that play we had put down.

1508
01:25:10.723 --> 01:25:14.306
all that money we took.
that was Drez shit.

1509
01:25:15.450 --> 01:25:16.555
- Drez?

1510
01:25:16.555 --> 01:25:18.138
Nigga is you crazy?

1511
01:25:19.116 --> 01:25:21.145
- Don't bitch up on me now.

1512
01:25:21.145 --> 01:25:22.146
Look I need to know you down

1513
01:25:22.146 --> 01:25:24.315
just in case we gotta shake shit up.

1514
01:25:24.315 --> 01:25:26.815
- Shake shit shut up like how?

1515
01:25:28.626 --> 01:25:31.320
- Put it on Jas.
- No. no look. come here.

1516
01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.699
Just think about it.

1517
01:25:32.699 --> 01:25:34.551
We could say the bitch Drea did it.

1518
01:25:34.551 --> 01:25:37.794
but who the fuck man you think
she's gonna mention first?

1519
01:25:37.794 --> 01:25:39.830
Look I don't want this
shit more than you don't.

1520
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:42.256
but we got to do the fuck we got to do

1521
01:25:42.256 --> 01:25:44.936
and I need to know if you're down.

1522
01:25:44.936 --> 01:25:46.603
Just think about it.

1523
01:25:55.078 --> 01:25:56.245
- What's wrong

1524
01:25:57.867 --> 01:26:00.556
- I just feel bad for this.

1525
01:26:00.556 --> 01:26:03.206
- Feel bad for getting money?

1526
01:26:03.206 --> 01:26:05.629
- I mean we were spending
something together

1527
01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:07.046
and not gonna go.

1528
01:26:08.047 --> 01:26:09.880
- That's the business.

1529
01:26:13.770 --> 01:26:16.937
Jul. you know I'm always at your back?

1530
01:26:18.126 --> 01:26:19.914
- I hope so.

1531
01:26:19.914 --> 01:26:22.331
But I don't always know that.

1532
01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:27.752
- Well. you better know that.

1533
01:26:27.752 --> 01:26:30.002
Come on with your fine ass.

1534
01:26:35.479 --> 01:26:40.146
I know this fucking Uber
driver better have a clean car.

1535
01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:54.460
- Don't worry about it Jasmine.

1536
01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:56.445
we going on a little ride yourself.

1537
01:26:56.445 --> 01:26:57.973
- You fucking with the wrong bitch.

1538
01:26:57.973 --> 01:27:01.890
- No I got the right
bitch. trust me. let's go.

1539
01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:05.393
- Well. it isn't the little bitch

1540
01:27:05.393 --> 01:27:07.724
who stole 500.000.

1541
01:27:07.724 --> 01:27:09.688
- I don't know who the
fuck either you are.

1542
01:27:09.688 --> 01:27:11.508
but I didn't steal shit
from either of you.

1543
01:27:11.508 --> 01:27:13.036
So you got the wrong Jasmine.

1544
01:27:13.036 --> 01:27:14.345
(laughs)

1545
01:27:14.345 --> 01:27:17.262
- No see. we got the right Jasmine.

1546
01:27:23.037 --> 01:27:27.816
However you're right. it
wasn't you that stole my money.

1547
01:27:27.816 --> 01:27:29.722
word is on the street it was
a little green-haired bitch

1548
01:27:29.722 --> 01:27:31.972
that work for you that did.

1549
01:27:33.686 --> 01:27:34.686
- Wait what?

1550
01:27:35.623 --> 01:27:37.948
- See that's what we're not gonna do.

1551
01:27:37.948 --> 01:27:39.659
we don't do interruption.

1552
01:27:39.659 --> 01:27:40.992
- Thank you man.

1553
01:27:43.913 --> 01:27:48.330
Now as I was saying. you
will pay me 500.000 in full.

1554
01:27:51.095 --> 01:27:55.345
See. I had to kill one of
my employees behind this.

1555
01:27:57.539 --> 01:27:59.999
So I'm gonna need that little
bitch who stole my money

1556
01:27:59.999 --> 01:28:02.666
I'm gonna need her dead as well.

1557
01:28:03.602 --> 01:28:06.893
But. I don't want you
to leave your thinking

1558
01:28:06.893 --> 01:28:08.393
I'm an unfair guy.

1559
01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:13.358
So I'm gonna give you what. would you say?

1560
01:28:13.358 --> 01:28:15.108
A week for the money?

1561
01:28:16.272 --> 01:28:20.189
But right now this guy
is gonna leave with you.

1562
01:28:26.166 --> 01:28:28.962
To take care of that
little thieving bitch.

1563
01:28:28.962 --> 01:28:31.379
You know. for my reassurance.

1564
01:28:33.738 --> 01:28:35.738
If that's okay with you.

1565
01:28:38.969 --> 01:28:43.475
- How I'm supposed to know
this is not some bullshit?

1566
01:28:43.475 --> 01:28:47.892
- All you need to know is
if you don't have my money.

1567
01:28:50.271 --> 01:28:54.154
(giggles) I will kill you.

1568
01:28:54.154 --> 01:28:56.071
And that's no bullshit.

1569

01:30:36.610 --> 01:30:41.360
The only rules I have. which
is don't steal from clients.

And because this man is
dead of all your lives

1595
01:30:49.141 --> 01:30:51.125

01:30:55.832 --> 01:30:59.800
'Cause I didn't just

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.467
I just saved your fucking lives.

1600
01:31:04.761 --> 01:31:07.428
(intense music)

1601
01:31:16.826 --> 01:31:19.243

1602
01:31:21.904 --> 01:31:23.913

1611
01:31:48.968 --> 01:31:53.804
And now that bitch is
floating in the fucking pool.

1612
01:31:53.804 --> 01:31:55.221
- You killed her?

1613
01:31:56.211 --> 01:31:58.617

- You're good. what's going on?

1619
01:32:19.408 --> 01:32:21.548
How was everything with the client?

1620
01:32:21.548 --> 01:32:25.381
- Well. actually. I
didn't have a client call.

1621
01:32:27.242 --> 01:32:29.939
I went to a doctor's appointment

1622
01:32:29.939 --> 01:32:32.356

1623
01:32:33.318 --> 01:32:34.818

1741
01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.423
- [] All right man.

1742
01:39:14.944 --> 01:39:15.861
- You late.

1743
01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:21.592
- Well. I had to make sure
you was actually by yourself.

1744
01:39:21.592 --> 01:39:25.509
I mean. sweeping this
building would take time.

1745
01:39:26.715 --> 01:39:27.965
Where my money?

1746
01:39:34.443 --> 01:39:37.526
(slow intense music)

1747
01:40:04.472 --> 01:40:06.222
- Is there a problem?

1748
01:40:07.625 --> 01:40:09.609
- You know what?

1749
01:40:09.609 --> 01:40:10.859
Actually it is.

1750
01:40:22.221 --> 01:40:24.611
You even had sense enough

1751
01:40:24.611 --> 01:40:27.000
to even change out the bills. huh Rail?

1752
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.833
(gunshot)
(intense music)

1753
01:40:35.715 --> 01:40:37.882
(gunshot)

1754
01:40:46.701 --> 01:40:48.784
- Jas. what are you into?

1755
01:40:52.943 --> 01:40:55.998
- Shit. fuck!
- Why are you even here?

1756
01:40:55.998 --> 01:40:59.228
- You don't get to ask
questions like that.

1757
01:40:59.228 --> 01:41:00.532
- Bast.
- Jas. what are you doing?

1758
01:41:00.532 --> 01:41:01.365
Come on.

1759
01:41:01.365 --> 01:41:03.129
- I can't let you do this.
- Do what?

1760
01:41:03.129 --> 01:41:05.962
- I can't let you not do your job.

1761
01:41:07.288 --> 01:41:08.371
I killed mom.

1762
01:41:09.661 --> 01:41:13.911
- What the fuck you talking
about. mommy overdosed.

1763
01:41:16.322 --> 01:41:17.489
- I hated her.

1764
01:41:19.675 --> 01:41:22.124
And either I had to kill her or myself.

1765
01:41:22.124 --> 01:41:25.874
that's how much I hated
her. and so I did it.

1766
01:41:27.248 --> 01:41:30.564
And you were right there
to protect me all the way.

1767
01:41:30.564 --> 01:41:33.849
And now I have to protect you.

1768
01:41:33.849 --> 01:41:36.227
Mom's not the only person I murdered.

1769
01:41:36.227 --> 01:41:37.060
(Sebastian shouting)

1770
01:41:37.060 --> 01:41:38.143
- Fuck. fuck.

1771
01:41:41.378 --> 01:41:42.545
What the fuck?

1772
01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:52.553
Why?

1773
01:41:59.692 --> 01:42:02.365
- What answer could I
possibly give you right now

1774
01:42:02.365 --> 01:42:05.782
that would make anything I'm saying okay.

1775
01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:09.453
This was bound to happen.

1776
01:42:11.611 --> 01:42:14.444
You know what you have to do Bast.

1777
01:42:21.911 --> 01:42:23.661
I'd rather it be you.

1778
01:42:31.013 --> 01:42:35.167
- So for the record for every
crime that you're admitting to

1779
01:42:35.167 --> 01:42:37.578
has nothing to do with
your brother detective.

1780
01:42:37.578 --> 01:42:40.304
Sebastian Bennett. no ties?

1781
01:42:40.304 --> 01:42:42.981
- Ma'am. the only crime
my brother ever committed

1782
01:42:42.981 --> 01:42:45.251
was loving me so much.

1783
01:42:45.251 --> 01:42:47.327
Well. how much you love yourself?

1784
01:42:47.327 --> 01:42:49.730
Let me help you. Jasmine.

1785
01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:51.520
Give me some of Drez sellers.

1786
01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:53.835
Some of the girls names. your girls names.

1787
01:42:53.835 --> 01:42:56.306
They're probably doing
shady deals themselves.

1788
01:42:56.306 --> 01:43:00.922
- Maybe they are. but the only
name I'm giving you is mine.

1789
01:43:00.922 --> 01:43:03.326
Bitch don't get greedy.

1790
01:43:03.326 --> 01:43:05.799
You got me that's all you getting.

1791
01:43:05.799 --> 01:43:08.184
- Unfucking believable.

1792
01:43:08.184 --> 01:43:10.215
I see this over and over again.

1793
01:43:10.215 --> 01:43:13.274
So quick to defend
everybody else but yourself.

1794
01:43:13.274 --> 01:43:14.608
And for what?

1795
01:43:14.608 --> 01:43:15.924
For street cred?

1796
01:43:15.924 --> 01:43:18.327
Not to tarnish your rep?

1797
01:43:18.327 --> 01:43:20.410
- Lady you don't know me.

1798
01:43:21.823 --> 01:43:23.639
- And I guess you think
that you're different

1799
01:43:23.639 --> 01:43:27.038
from every other criminal that
comes and sits in this seat.

1800
01:43:27.038 --> 01:43:30.694
Not only have I seen it. but I know it.

1801
01:43:30.694 --> 01:43:34.415
That's right. I grew up in the hood too.

1802
01:43:34.415 --> 01:43:36.172
- Drugs in and out my house.

1803
01:43:36.172 --> 01:43:38.336
Murders right in front of my face.

1804
01:43:38.336 --> 01:43:40.952
But I still chose not to live that life.

1805
01:43:40.952 --> 01:43:44.513
that's the difference between me and you.

1806
01:43:44.513 --> 01:43:49.430
Now take the deal or pay the
price I know you can't afford.

1807
01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:56.501
- Just because you grew up in the hood

1808
01:43:56.501 --> 01:43:59.752
doesn't mean you grew up in
my hood or lived in my house

1809
01:43:59.752 --> 01:44:02.137
and went through what I went through.

1810
01:44:02.137 --> 01:44:04.558
Y'all motherfuckers always
so quick to judge somebody

1811
01:44:04.558 --> 01:44:07.240
and think somebody's got a choice.

1812
01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.680
sometimes you got a choice.

1813
01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:12.636
You got to do what you got to
do to get through this world.

1814
01:44:12.636 --> 01:44:16.311
And you tell me take the
plea or pay the price.

1815
01:44:16.311 --> 01:44:19.810
bitch I already paid the ultimate price.

1816
01:44:19.810 --> 01:44:21.310
the price of love.

1817
01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:24.827
(intense music)

1818
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:30.830
the price of love.

1819
