00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:32.379
- You go ahead. I'll
go and get Seth.

4
00:05:33.838 --> 00:05:35.970
Seth seems to have
settled in already.

5
00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:45.078
It's only a temporary situation.

6
00:05:46.851 --> 00:05:51.117
If it's difficult for you
to live here. we could-

7
00:05:51.152 --> 00:05:53.757
- Put it on the market. I know.

8
00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:54.626
- Exactly.

9
00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:29.430
Hey.

10
00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:38.439
It's nothing. relax.

11
00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:41.068
Breathe.

12
00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:44.511
relax and breathe.

13
00:06:47.912 --> 00:06:49.208
Relax and breathe.

14
00:06:52.785 --> 00:06:53.850
That's right.

15
00:06:55.557 --> 00:06:56.589
relax and breathe.

16
00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:02.892
- You need to breathe.
to take a deep breath.

17
00:07:02.927 --> 00:07:04.058
It'll help you.

18
00:07:04.093 --> 00:07:05.697
- I'm scared.

19
00:07:05.732 --> 00:07:08.535
- There's no need to be.
it's only a bad dream.

20
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.000
We all have dreams. I
dream. Mommy dreams.

21
00:07:12.035 --> 00:07:14.068
- And do you have
bad dreams. too?

22
00:07:14.103 --> 00:07:18.545
- Sometimes. but then I wake
up and it all disappears.

23
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.042
and you've always got
Mr. Bear with you.

24
00:07:21.077 --> 00:07:22.615
Come on. try to get some sleep.

25
00:07:25.015 --> 00:07:25.647
- No.

26
00:07:27.622 --> 00:07:29.248
- You want me to leave it on?

27
00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:31.558
Okay. we'll leave it.

28
00:07:34.563 --> 00:07:35.188
Good night.

29
00:08:34.689 --> 00:08:35.722
- Kena
Saunders. the girl

30
00:08:35.757 --> 00:08:37.624
who disappeared three
years ago. has been found

31
00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.219
at the bottom of a lake.
thanks to the intervention

32
00:08:39.254 --> 00:08:41.628
of the psychic. David Owen.

33
00:08:41.663 --> 00:08:44.158
According to reports. on the
morning of September 10th.

34
00:08:44.193 --> 00:08:46.633
Mr. Owen led a group of scuba
divers to the lake shore.

35
00:08:46.668 --> 00:08:48.294
telling them. "She's here."

36
00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:50.329
A robot with a camera
was then submerged.

37
00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:51.836
and at the bottom of the-

38
00:08:51.871 --> 00:08:52.837
- May I?

39
00:08:52.872 --> 00:08:54.036
- Thanks.
- At the depth

40
00:08:54.071 --> 00:08:55.675
of over 100 meters.
her car was found.

41
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.369
The license plate
matched. leaving no doubt.

42
00:08:57.404 --> 00:08:59.107
The question that
must now be asked is.

43
00:08:59.142 --> 00:09:00.944
how did Mr. Owen find her?

44
00:09:00.979 --> 00:09:01.879
Here's what the-

45
00:09:01.914 --> 00:09:04.211
- There you go. you'll be late.

46
00:09:04.246 --> 00:09:06.653
- Not if I take this with me.

47
00:09:06.688 --> 00:09:10.052
I'll be home late tonight.
we have a work dinner. so-

48
00:09:12.859 --> 00:09:13.660
- Have a nice day.

49
00:09:13.695 --> 00:09:15.761
- Okay.

50
00:09:15.796 --> 00:09:17.323
- Who was
pleasantly impressed

51
00:09:17.358 --> 00:09:21.360
by the man's abilities.
so seer or charlatan?

52
00:10:57.458 --> 00:10:59.898
- Hey. sweetie. Mommy's here.

53
00:11:03.332 --> 00:11:05.167
Don't cry. shh. shh. shh.

54
00:11:39.401 --> 00:11:42.435
- You can't play in here.
especially with Mommy's stuff.

55
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.041
and I'll need that ball of yarn.

56
00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:06.833
- Bye. darling.

57
00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:14.071
Well. it's not that different.

58
00:12:14.106 --> 00:12:15.534
- Oh. really?

59
00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:19.043
- Sure. for me. it's just
a change of location.

60
00:12:19.078 --> 00:12:20.374
- Uh. what about
your old clients?

61
00:12:20.409 --> 00:12:22.013
- They're still my clients.

62
00:12:22.048 --> 00:12:23.377
I'll continue to
manage their policies.

63
00:12:23.412 --> 00:12:24.246
- Good.

64
00:12:25.953 --> 00:12:28.415
So what was that big
news you mentioned?

65
00:12:37.426 --> 00:12:39.063
What does this mean?

66
00:12:39.098 --> 00:12:40.262
- It's a first class ticket.

67
00:12:42.035 --> 00:12:43.562
- I can see that.

68
00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:45.432
- Obviously it's
something positive.

69
00:12:46.435 --> 00:12:48.270
- Okay. but what does it mean?

70
00:12:50.142 --> 00:12:53.242
- I'll be going away for a few
days for a training course.

71
00:12:53.277 --> 00:12:54.947
So do you realize
what this means?

72
00:12:56.313 --> 00:12:58.577
It means that the company
is investing in me.

73
00:13:00.449 --> 00:13:04.418
preparing me for something
really important.

74
00:13:04.453 --> 00:13:06.519
So what do you think?

75
00:13:06.554 --> 00:13:07.353
- I'm happy for you.

76
00:13:09.062 --> 00:13:11.359
- Oh. come on.
Alyson. what's wrong?

77
00:13:11.394 --> 00:13:12.228
- Nothing.

78
00:13:14.463 --> 00:13:15.935
- You're such a bad liar.

79
00:13:21.008 --> 00:13:21.842
A toast?

80
00:13:27.113 --> 00:13:29.641
- My father just
committed suicide.

81
00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:32.985
We moved to this house with
all our things still to be in-

82
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.284
- Alyson. I understand you.

83
00:13:36.518 --> 00:13:38.122
- You don't understand anything.

84
00:13:38.157 --> 00:13:41.422
- Life has a cost.
our child has a cost.

85
00:13:41.457 --> 00:13:43.963
and this is something big.

86
00:13:43.998 --> 00:13:46.427
- Well. moving to this house
is something big for me.

87
00:13:46.462 --> 00:13:49.067
a huge sacrifice.

88
00:13:49.102 --> 00:13:52.268
The least you could do was
at least stay by my side.

89
00:13:52.303 --> 00:13:54.468
- That's exactly
what I'm going to do.

90
00:13:54.503 --> 00:13:56.173
and I'll do it as
soon as I come back.

91
00:13:57.341 --> 00:13:59.077
Try to think about us.

92
00:13:59.112 --> 00:14:00.441
- That's exactly what I'm doing.

93
00:14:08.022 --> 00:14:10.154
Will she be coming with you?

94
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.928
Your colleague. will
she be coming with you?

95
00:14:17.064 --> 00:14:18.426
- What's that supposed to mean?

96
00:14:20.232 --> 00:14:23.530
- The same plane. a seat
next to you. the same hotel?

97
00:14:25.138 --> 00:14:26.335
Will you be sharing
a room. as well?

98
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.205
- I knew you would have
brought this up again.

99
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.009
- Perhaps that's
because you hurt me.

100
00:14:30.044 --> 00:14:32.506
Perhaps that's because you
didn't realize how I felt.

101
00:14:32.541 --> 00:14:34.607
- Come on. five years.

102
00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:37.544
It was five years ago.

103
00:14:41.649 --> 00:14:44.518
We said we wouldn't have
spoken about it again

104
00:14:44.553 --> 00:14:45.926
because we had got over it.

105
00:14:47.061 --> 00:14:49.226
We would have carried
on with our lives.

106
00:14:49.261 --> 00:14:52.559
but you are still there.
stuck in the past.

107
00:14:52.594 --> 00:14:53.967
- Well. you could have refused.

108
00:14:54.002 --> 00:14:56.629
- Refused what.
our biggest chance

109
00:14:56.664 --> 00:14:58.697
to finally sort things
out once and for all?

110
00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:01.469
- This wasn't the moment to
go. Richard. and you know it.

111
00:15:01.504 --> 00:15:03.075
- And you think
if I had said no.

112
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.110
my boss would have offered
me the chance again

113
00:15:05.145 --> 00:15:07.574
in the future. do you
really think that?

114
00:15:07.609 --> 00:15:11.083
- Well. you could have
at least spoken with him.

115
00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:14.185
explained to him the
situation. ask him to postpone.

116
00:15:16.783 --> 00:15:18.552
But I bet you didn't
even try. did you?

117
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:25.526
That's what I thought.

118
00:16:59.325 --> 00:17:03.426
- Mommy's not well. she's ill.

119
00:17:03.461 --> 00:17:07.463
She's very ill. but
she'll get better soon.

120
00:17:07.498 --> 00:17:09.135
- When?

121
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.829
- It's gonna take a
long time. princess.

122
00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:13.700
but I promise you.
she will get better.

123
00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:17.671
- To regain victory.
regain victory over evil

124
00:17:17.706 --> 00:17:19.310
that may surpass all-

125
00:17:19.345 --> 00:17:21.774
- That's daddy's friend.
he's come to visit us.

126
00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:24.546
and he's going to help Mommy.

127
00:17:24.581 --> 00:17:27.153
And two more friends
are coming. too.

128
00:17:27.188 --> 00:17:31.124
all the way from America.
and they love children.

129
00:17:34.228 --> 00:17:35.392
Let me tell you a secret.

130
00:17:36.923 --> 00:17:40.562
They have a huge house
with lots of toys.

131
00:17:40.597 --> 00:17:43.730
and I've been there and
had a great time playing

132
00:17:43.765 --> 00:17:47.470
with all of them. so
you want to see it?

133
00:17:48.737 --> 00:17:50.473
Are you sure?

134
00:17:50.508 --> 00:17:54.213
It's fantastic. and you can
take Mr. Bear with you. too.

135
00:17:55.612 --> 00:17:59.581
So do you want to go with
them. you and Mr. Bear.

136
00:17:59.616 --> 00:18:01.319
just until Mommy
gets better again?

137
00:18:04.621 --> 00:18:06.885
You'll have fun. you'll see.

138
00:18:11.199 --> 00:18:11.890
That must be them now.

139
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.217
- Alyson. if I don't
get on that plane.

140
00:18:31.252 --> 00:18:32.845
they will send someone
else in my place.

141
00:18:34.486 --> 00:18:36.915
and that will be bad news
for the both of us.

142
00:18:39.689 --> 00:18:40.523
Look at me.

143
00:18:44.628 --> 00:18:45.792
Everything will be fine.

144
00:18:47.367 --> 00:18:49.301
You and Seth will be
fine and I'll be back

145
00:18:49.336 --> 00:18:50.632
before you even know I'm gone.

146
00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:28.889
- Stop crying.
I beg you. stop!

147
00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:36.336
Your breath. your
breath is so warm.

148
00:21:37.801 --> 00:21:38.767
Now be quiet.

149
00:21:43.444 --> 00:21:45.642
Silence!

150
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:58.490
- Alyson.
what's wrong?

151
00:21:58.525 --> 00:21:59.920
- She wanted
to take him away from me

152
00:21:59.955 --> 00:22:01.361
and it was terrible-
- She?

153
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:03.495
Who are you talking about?

154
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:05.497
What's happening?

155
00:22:06.665 --> 00:22:07.829
- I could
feel her eyes on me.

156
00:22:07.864 --> 00:22:09.094
- Are you both okay?

157
00:22:09.129 --> 00:22:10.964
- I woke
up. I couldn't move.

158
00:22:10.999 --> 00:22:13.439
- You and Seth. are you okay?

159
00:22:13.474 --> 00:22:17.135
- Yes. Seth is fine. he's
here with me.

160
00:22:20.481 --> 00:22:21.909
It felt so real. Richard.

161
00:22:24.012 --> 00:22:25.979
She wanted to hurt us.

162
00:22:26.014 --> 00:22:27.486
- Who?

163
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:29.081
- I don't know who.
she said she wanted

164
00:22:29.116 --> 00:22:32.491
to take him away from me. that
she would have shut him up.

165
00:22:32.526 --> 00:22:34.823
- Alyson. now
you need to calm down.

166
00:22:34.858 --> 00:22:36.528
It was a hallucination.

167
00:22:36.563 --> 00:22:38.156
one of your nighttime
hallucinations.

168
00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:40.026
- No. this time
it was different.

169
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:41.698
It wasn't like the others.

170
00:22:41.733 --> 00:22:44.602
- Take a deep breath
and calm down. please.

171
00:22:44.637 --> 00:22:46.439
- I'm sorry. I
shouldn't have called you.

172
00:22:46.474 --> 00:22:47.836
- No. you did the right thing.

173
00:22:48.971 --> 00:22:50.641
- Richard?

174
00:22:50.676 --> 00:22:52.170
- What?

175
00:22:52.205 --> 00:22:54.172
- When are
you coming back?

176
00:22:54.207 --> 00:22:55.415
- I'll be back soon.

177
00:22:57.584 --> 00:22:58.946
Now you need to try to relax.

178
00:23:00.983 --> 00:23:02.521
Are you taking your medication?

179
00:23:05.053 --> 00:23:05.887
Alyson?

180
00:23:08.122 --> 00:23:09.825
- I'm listening.

181
00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.530
- Are you
taking your medication?

182
00:23:13.061 --> 00:23:14.533
- No. I-

183
00:23:14.568 --> 00:23:16.601
- Take it
and go back to bed.

184
00:23:16.636 --> 00:23:18.966
Take Seth with you if
it makes you better.

185
00:23:19.001 --> 00:23:20.638
but you need to get
some rest. okay?

186
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:22.805
- Okay.

187
00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:26.875
Richard?

188
00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:27.810
- What?

189
00:23:29.913 --> 00:23:30.846
- Come back soon.

190
00:23:32.179 --> 00:23:33.585
- Okay.

191
00:23:34.984 --> 00:23:36.214
- Good night. Richard.

192
00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:37.215
- Good night.

193
00:25:40.043 --> 00:25:43.110
- No
peeking. I can see you.

194
00:25:43.145 --> 00:25:49.347
- One. two. three. four. five-

195
00:25:49.382 --> 00:25:51.855
- Come on. let's run and hide.

196
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.824
- Six. seven. eight.

197
00:25:53.859 --> 00:25:55.320
- Behind that tree.

198
00:25:55.355 --> 00:26:00.292
- Nine. 10. 11. 12.

199
00:26:00.998 --> 00:26:01.898
13. 14. 15-

200
00:26:04.331 --> 00:26:05.264
- What
are you drawing?

201
00:26:05.299 --> 00:26:06.067
Let me see.

202
00:26:08.104 --> 00:26:11.677
Okay. so this is me
and these are stairs.

203
00:26:11.712 --> 00:26:14.845
but. but who's
this. is this Mommy?

204
00:26:15.947 --> 00:26:17.749
Why did you draw this?

205
00:26:17.784 --> 00:26:18.750
- That's not Mommy.

206
00:26:22.217 --> 00:26:26.252
- Susan.
Susan. is that you?

207
00:26:33.426 --> 00:26:34.260
Susan?

208
00:26:37.298 --> 00:26:41.740
Jesus. Susan. you
scared the life out of-

209
00:26:41.775 --> 00:26:45.678
- As I've told you. we need to
verify the type of disorder.

210
00:26:45.713 --> 00:26:47.911
whether it's psychological
or paranormal.

211
00:26:47.946 --> 00:26:52.014
I'm often called for cases
where a person is suffering

212
00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:55.215
from some sort of
dissociative disorder.

213
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.922
psychosis. schizophrenia.
or the person is bipolar.

214
00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:03.289
In cases like these.
I can do very little.

215
00:27:05.128 --> 00:27:06.831
Have you been to see a doctor?

216
00:27:06.866 --> 00:27:09.130
- She started
therapy about a month ago

217
00:27:09.165 --> 00:27:11.297
and she's taking
psychiatric medication.

218
00:27:12.839 --> 00:27:15.367
- And have there been
any improvements?

219
00:27:15.402 --> 00:27:17.138
- No.
the situation seems

220
00:27:17.173 --> 00:27:18.744
to be getting worse and worse.

221
00:27:20.814 --> 00:27:23.881
Father Elbert. I need your help.

222
00:27:28.151 --> 00:27:29.689
Stop it now.

223
00:27:32.122 --> 00:27:34.694
Susan. please. stop it. Susan.

224
00:28:09.357 --> 00:28:10.455
- Yes?

225
00:28:13.933 --> 00:28:18.463
- Um. I got your address from
the parish priest in town.

226
00:28:18.498 --> 00:28:20.201
- How can I help?

227
00:28:20.236 --> 00:28:22.038
- My name is Alyson.

228
00:28:22.073 --> 00:28:25.371
About 25 years ago. a man
came to ask you for help.

229
00:28:27.078 --> 00:28:29.111
He wanted to save his wife.

230
00:28:29.146 --> 00:28:32.818
That man was my father.
his name was Anthony.

231
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.217
- I'm sorry. I don't
remember that name.

232
00:28:36.252 --> 00:28:38.483
- You have to remember
it. you were in my home.

233
00:28:38.518 --> 00:28:40.892
you met my parents.

234
00:28:40.927 --> 00:28:42.993
- I don't remember
anything of the sort.

235
00:28:43.028 --> 00:28:44.192
- I need to know.

236
00:28:44.227 --> 00:28:45.556
- Many years have passed.

237
00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:47.833
You're confusing me
for someone else.

238
00:28:47.868 --> 00:28:49.901
- Can you please tell
me what happened?

239
00:28:49.936 --> 00:28:52.068
- There's nothing to
tell. nothing to remember.

240
00:28:52.103 --> 00:28:53.905
Please don't waste
any more of my time.

241
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.500
It would be better
for you to leave now.

242
00:28:55.535 --> 00:28:57.106
I can't help you.

243
00:28:58.274 --> 00:29:00.340
- Father Elbert. I need to know.

244
00:29:02.146 --> 00:29:04.212
I live in the same house
with my husband and my son.

245
00:29:04.247 --> 00:29:06.346
I. I don't feel safe there.

246
00:29:08.251 --> 00:29:09.085
Please.

247
00:30:22.391 --> 00:30:23.588
- Good morning. Alyson.

248
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:31.629
- Would you like a cup of tea?

249
00:30:34.502 --> 00:30:36.007
Would you like a cup of tea?

250
00:30:36.042 --> 00:30:37.074
- No. thank you.

251
00:30:40.706 --> 00:30:42.915
I expect you're wondering
why I changed my mind.

252
00:30:45.546 --> 00:30:47.447
You have the same expression
as your father had

253
00:30:47.482 --> 00:30:48.415
when I met him.

254
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.484
- In the attic the other night.

255
00:30:51.519 --> 00:30:54.487
I found a videotape from
my father's video camera.

256
00:30:56.095 --> 00:30:59.965
There were images of
him. my mother. me.

257
00:31:03.498 --> 00:31:04.332
and you. too.

258
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.104
- Me?

259
00:31:07.139 --> 00:31:07.973
- Yeah.

260
00:31:09.339 --> 00:31:11.042
I guess you didn't
know about that.

261
00:31:14.212 --> 00:31:15.442
Why did my father come to you?

262
00:31:15.477 --> 00:31:17.213
- I believe you know
the answer to that.

263
00:31:19.415 --> 00:31:23.153
Reality is. you're
afraid of the truth.

264
00:31:24.618 --> 00:31:25.419
- My father-

265
00:31:25.454 --> 00:31:27.058
- Your father loved you.

266
00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:34.164
A love for a child can often
bring about painful choices.

267
00:31:36.036 --> 00:31:38.135
Your father thought that by
keeping you away from here.

268
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.973
putting you up for
adoption. you'd be safe.

269
00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:43.976
- Safe from what?

270
00:31:46.409 --> 00:31:50.983
They always told me my mother
died of cancer. is that true?

271
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.020
What happened to her?

272
00:31:56.254 --> 00:32:00.091
- Anthony came to me
to ask for my help.

273
00:32:00.126 --> 00:32:02.027
He was convinced that there was

274
00:32:03.756 --> 00:32:07.428
an entity harboring in his wife.

275
00:32:11.566 --> 00:32:13.038
He was right.

276
00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:45.433
You who represent
the salvation of man.

277
00:32:45.468 --> 00:32:49.140
listen to the voices of your
apostles. Peter and Paul.

278
00:32:49.175 --> 00:32:51.604
and of all the saints.
who by your grace.

279
00:32:51.639 --> 00:32:53.243
gained victory over evil.

280
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.775
Free your servant from
this diabolical oppression

281
00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.316
and keep her unharmed.
that she may return

282
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:04.122
to the serenity of being
your faithful child.

283
00:33:04.157 --> 00:33:07.488
to love you wholeheartedly.
to serve you by doing good-

284
00:33:07.523 --> 00:33:09.787
- Lies. lies. lies!

285
00:33:09.822 --> 00:33:12.658
- And to honor you
and bring you glory.

286
00:33:14.134 --> 00:33:17.168
her whole life being a
song of praise to you.

287
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.111
Evil being. tell me your name.

288
00:33:30.315 --> 00:33:33.349
I order you. evil one.
seducer of mankind.

289
00:33:34.715 --> 00:33:37.683
recognize the spirit
of truth and grace.

290
00:33:37.718 --> 00:33:40.587
the spirit that
rejects your deceptions

291
00:33:40.622 --> 00:33:42.721
and unmasks your lies.

292
00:33:42.756 --> 00:33:44.822
Abandon this creature Susan.

293
00:33:48.498 --> 00:33:50.498
Through the anointing
of his spirit.

294
00:33:50.533 --> 00:33:53.204
God has made you
his holy temple.

295
00:34:23.896 --> 00:34:27.667
I order you to recognize
the invincible power

296
00:34:27.702 --> 00:34:31.242
of Jesus Christ almighty.

297
00:34:31.277 --> 00:34:35.279
Remove this creature.
abandon Susan's body.

298
00:34:35.314 --> 00:34:38.249
whom the savior. having
been born amongst us.

299
00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:40.713
made her a sister.
died upon the cross.

300
00:34:40.748 --> 00:34:42.550
redeemed her with his blood.

301
00:34:43.916 --> 00:34:45.817
Tell me who you are.

302
00:34:45.852 --> 00:34:49.194
- I am the she who
dwells in here.

303
00:34:49.229 --> 00:34:52.890
- Tell me your name and
leave this creature of God.

304
00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:02.438
Christ orders you from
the height of his power

305
00:35:02.473 --> 00:35:07.179
to abandon his child.
what is you name?

306
00:35:18.786 --> 00:35:20.885
- I am the bride that was killed

307
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.888
at the hands of this bloodline.

308
00:35:33.834 --> 00:35:35.900
- I was unable to help her.

309
00:35:35.935 --> 00:35:37.374
In the following weeks.

310
00:35:37.409 --> 00:35:39.475
that evil being came
back to torment him.

311
00:35:42.678 --> 00:35:43.776
He was terrorized.

312
00:36:36.666 --> 00:36:38.798
- Who's this being?

313
00:36:38.833 --> 00:36:40.305
- Her name was Mary.

314
00:36:41.737 --> 00:36:44.606
She was your
grandfather's first wife.

315
00:36:44.641 --> 00:36:46.311
- When I'm paralyzed
in my sleep.

316
00:36:46.346 --> 00:36:48.709
they always told me they
were hallucinations.

317
00:36:51.879 --> 00:36:52.977
- I'm
afraid they aren't.

318
00:36:56.389 --> 00:36:58.521
- What does she
want from my family?

319
00:36:58.556 --> 00:37:03.053
- The woman disappeared
shortly after the wedding.

320
00:37:03.088 --> 00:37:05.330
The local authorities
could find no trace of her.

321
00:37:07.026 --> 00:37:11.831
Your grandfather remarried
and they had two children.

322
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.801
Susan. your mother. and Eve.

323
00:37:16.673 --> 00:37:18.002
Only Susan survived.

324
00:37:24.549 --> 00:37:26.384
- Good night. darling.

325
00:37:27.783 --> 00:37:30.520
- Mommy. who are you talking to?

326
00:37:54.579 --> 00:37:56.777
- This evil is present
in our world. Alyson.

327
00:38:00.453 --> 00:38:03.014
Have you sensed any
presences in this house

328
00:38:03.049 --> 00:38:03.949
since you moved in?

329
00:38:06.987 --> 00:38:08.756
How did you feel
these presences?

330
00:38:11.497 --> 00:38:12.331
- I-

331
00:38:14.533 --> 00:38:16.093
- Have you
noticed anything strange

332
00:38:16.128 --> 00:38:17.402
in the last few days?

333
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:20.933
Objects moving. noises?

334
00:38:24.444 --> 00:38:26.543
Alyson. Alyson?

335
00:38:27.744 --> 00:38:29.348
Are you listening to me. Alyson?

336
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.756
What is it. what's there?

337
00:38:41.791 --> 00:38:42.427
- She's here.

338
00:38:43.694 --> 00:38:44.957
I want to get out of here.

339
00:38:44.992 --> 00:38:46.959
- Alyson. listen to me.

340
00:38:48.435 --> 00:38:50.127
It's not the house
that is damned.

341
00:38:51.867 --> 00:38:54.934
It's the family. there's
a curse on all of you.

342
00:38:54.969 --> 00:38:57.640
you. your husband and your son.

343
00:38:58.676 --> 00:38:59.972
you're all in danger.

344
00:39:00.007 --> 00:39:01.710
- What's going on here?

345
00:39:01.745 --> 00:39:02.579
- Richard.

346
00:39:04.209 --> 00:39:07.518
- My name is Father Elbert
and I came here to help you.

347
00:39:07.553 --> 00:39:08.651
- I don't understand.

348
00:39:08.686 --> 00:39:09.949
- We have a problem.

349
00:39:09.984 --> 00:39:12.017
- Problem. what are
you talking about?

350
00:39:12.052 --> 00:39:13.953
- What's been
happening to your wife.

351
00:39:13.988 --> 00:39:16.153
they're not
hallucinations or dreams.

352
00:39:16.188 --> 00:39:18.529
It's a soul in
search of revenge.

353
00:39:18.564 --> 00:39:19.530
- Are you serious?

354
00:39:19.565 --> 00:39:21.026
- Revenge on your family.

355
00:39:23.195 --> 00:39:26.867
There is a chance that
the bride can find peace

356
00:39:26.902 --> 00:39:30.607
if her remains are
recovered. blessed.

357
00:39:30.642 --> 00:39:32.543
and buried in sacred ground.

358
00:39:32.578 --> 00:39:34.875
- Okay. I've heard enough.

359
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:36.877
Thanks for your visit. but now
I have to ask you to leave.

360
00:39:36.912 --> 00:39:39.616
- Richard. no. Father
Elbert. please.

361
00:39:39.651 --> 00:39:41.145
- It's all right. it's fine.

362
00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.487
I'll leave you two now.

363
00:39:44.524 --> 00:39:47.558
- Richard. we need his help.

364
00:39:47.593 --> 00:39:48.823
- Why would we be in danger?

365
00:39:49.925 --> 00:39:51.056
Just because of your nightmares?

366
00:39:51.091 --> 00:39:52.695
You've had them since
you were a girl.

367
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:53.960
- You weren't here.

368
00:39:53.995 --> 00:39:55.995
you didn't see all the
things that happened.

369
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.502
We need him.

370
00:39:57.537 --> 00:40:00.197
- A priest. you're an atheist.

371
00:40:00.232 --> 00:40:02.672
- I know what I saw.
you have to believe me.

372
00:40:04.269 --> 00:40:06.071
- Alyson. you need
to speak to somebody.

373
00:40:12.244 --> 00:40:14.849
- Father. I'm so sorry.

374
00:40:16.116 --> 00:40:18.149
- Don't apologize.
sometimes it's difficult

375
00:40:18.184 --> 00:40:20.657
to believe in that which
we don't understand.

376
00:40:20.692 --> 00:40:24.991
- So finding the bride's
remains. could that help?

377
00:40:27.193 --> 00:40:28.929
- Come to me tomorrow morning.

378
00:40:28.964 --> 00:40:30.568
Bring the boy. don't
leave him here.

379
00:40:32.066 --> 00:40:33.736
We will find a solution.

380
00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:49.905
Our Lord. our Father.
I ask and implore you

381
00:42:51.007 --> 00:42:54.008
for a straight put to flight

382
00:42:54.043 --> 00:42:57.748
and drive out all
these diabolical powers

383
00:43:00.049 --> 00:43:04.755
and diabolical presences.
Satanic machinations.

384
00:43:06.121 --> 00:43:09.254
every evil influence.

385
00:43:09.289 --> 00:43:11.388
every curse and evil eye.

386
00:43:17.803 --> 00:43:22.399
- Bride.

387
00:44:00.307 --> 00:44:01.207
- Richard?

388
00:44:10.185 --> 00:44:11.118
Father Elbert.

389
00:44:36.112 --> 00:44:36.946
Richard!

390
00:44:40.512 --> 00:44:41.313
Richard!

391
00:44:42.987 --> 00:44:44.415
Richard!

392
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.285
- The door won't open!

393
00:45:12.852 --> 00:45:14.016
Alyson. what happened?

394
00:45:17.252 --> 00:45:22.057
- Seth.

395
00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.410
- Can you tell me

396
00:45:45.445 --> 00:45:48.083
what time you realized
the baby was missing?

397
00:45:48.118 --> 00:45:50.184
- It must have
been around three.

398
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:54.419
- And the room is exactly
how you found it. right?

399
00:45:54.454 --> 00:45:56.388
- Exactly. we haven't
touched anything.

400
00:46:01.263 --> 00:46:04.330
- Do you have any reason

401
00:46:04.365 --> 00:46:07.366
to believe somebody could
have any problems with you?

402
00:46:07.401 --> 00:46:09.335
- Problems. with us?

403
00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.041
- Yes. have you
argued with anybody?

404
00:46:12.076 --> 00:46:14.175
Do you have any enemies here?

405
00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:17.442
- No. as I told you.
we've only just moved in.

406
00:46:17.477 --> 00:46:19.543
- Usually these kinds of
kidnappings are followed

407
00:46:19.578 --> 00:46:24.086
by ransom demands. so
always answer your phone.

408
00:46:24.121 --> 00:46:26.583
Every incoming and ongoing
call will be recorded.

409
00:46:27.927 --> 00:46:29.124
In the meantime.

410
00:46:29.159 --> 00:46:30.587
we'll do everything we
can to find your child.

411
00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:49.111
- There was a phenomenon
in the living room.

412
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:54.380
The door was closed and I
just couldn't get them open.

413
00:46:54.415 --> 00:46:57.251
and I'm sure there was
no one on the other side.

414
00:46:59.024 --> 00:46:59.583
- Hmm.

415
00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:19.504
Can you show me the bedroom?

416
00:47:37.326 --> 00:47:40.294
- Neither me or my
husband had mentioned a bedroom.

417
00:47:40.329 --> 00:47:42.032
how did-
- How did I know?

418
00:47:42.694 --> 00:47:43.528
- Yeah.

419
00:47:51.208 --> 00:47:52.537
- What's
in your pocket?

420
00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:56.376
- Excuse me?

421
00:47:56.411 --> 00:47:57.509
- Your
pocket. I can see

422
00:47:57.544 --> 00:47:59.016
you're playing with something.

423
00:48:00.646 --> 00:48:01.480
- Yes.

424
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:14.328
It's like a marble. I
always carry it with me.

425
00:48:14.363 --> 00:48:15.230
It was given to me by.

426
00:48:17.498 --> 00:48:19.069
it was given to me
a long time ago.

427
00:48:20.468 --> 00:48:22.435
- And what does it do?

428
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:23.403
- It changes color.

429
00:48:25.341 --> 00:48:29.145
Now it's clear. see. that's
good. that's positive.

430
00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:31.081
It means the situation
around us is stable.

431
00:48:31.116 --> 00:48:33.248
There's no other presence here.

432
00:48:33.283 --> 00:48:35.987
When it goes gray. that
means there is a presence.

433
00:48:36.022 --> 00:48:37.549
but that's usually
a benevolent one.

434
00:48:37.584 --> 00:48:39.188
Most spirits don't
mean us any harm.

435
00:48:40.554 --> 00:48:43.258
And when it goes very
dark. that means. well.

436
00:48:49.101 --> 00:48:49.726
- Well?

437
00:48:51.466 --> 00:48:53.004
- Well. it means
we're in trouble.

438
00:48:56.438 --> 00:48:59.109
Alyson. you felt these
presences first. is that right?

439
00:49:07.251 --> 00:49:09.350
I want you to hold onto
the photograph of Seth

440
00:49:11.816 --> 00:49:13.354
and I need you to
close your eyes.

441
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.260
And whatever you hear.
whatever you feel.

442
00:49:19.659 --> 00:49:22.231
I need you to keep your
eyes closed. understand?

443
00:49:24.136 --> 00:49:28.105
Good. now I want you
to visualize Seth.

444
00:49:29.504 --> 00:49:31.108
really focus on your son.

445
00:49:33.772 --> 00:49:36.410
And your thoughts will travel
through you as emotions.

446
00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.712
Really try to see him
in your mind's eye.

447
00:49:43.617 --> 00:49:45.716
That's very good.
Alyson. very good.

448
00:50:26.561 --> 00:50:28.495
I am truly sorry for
what happened to you.

449
00:50:30.664 --> 00:50:33.302
but I have not come
here to negotiate.

450
00:50:33.337 --> 00:50:35.205
This family wants
their son back.

451
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.174
the child you have
taken from them.

452
00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.455
From what Father Elbert told you

453
00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:30.557
and from what I have been
able to verify for myself.

454
00:51:30.592 --> 00:51:32.922
I have reached a conclusion.
but I need to be very clear.

455
00:51:32.957 --> 00:51:36.695
this is just an
opinion. it's a theory.

456
00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:38.895
- We're here to listen to you.

457
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:39.764
- Okay.

458
00:51:43.539 --> 00:51:47.277
When I first came into this
house. what I felt was anger.

459
00:51:49.446 --> 00:51:50.544
so much anger.

460
00:51:52.647 --> 00:51:54.713
The spirit we are dealing
with wants revenge.

461
00:51:54.748 --> 00:51:56.847
She wants back what
was taken from her.

462
00:51:56.882 --> 00:52:00.917
She craves life. but
not just her own life.

463
00:52:00.952 --> 00:52:02.358
the fetus in the cradle.

464
00:52:03.691 --> 00:52:05.625
- What does it mean?

465
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:06.725
- The bride was pregnant.

466
00:52:08.663 --> 00:52:11.367
When she was murdered. she
lost not just her own life.

467
00:52:11.402 --> 00:52:12.929
but also that of
her unborn child.

468
00:52:14.834 --> 00:52:16.636
The symbol on the wall tells me

469
00:52:16.671 --> 00:52:19.903
that she has asked for help
from a very powerful and. uh.

470
00:52:21.775 --> 00:52:23.907
a very evil force.

471
00:52:23.942 --> 00:52:26.613
- What. what evil force?

472
00:52:27.781 --> 00:52:31.981
- Asmodeus. Asmodeus is a demon.

473
00:52:32.016 --> 00:52:34.951
He's a great king in
the hierarchy of the
infernal spirits.

474
00:52:34.986 --> 00:52:37.723
He's the lord of
wrath and vengeance.

475
00:52:37.758 --> 00:52:40.330
and I think that's who you've
been seeing in the house.

476
00:52:42.367 --> 00:52:44.235
He has granted the
bride's spirit the power

477
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:48.965
to return from the
dead for revenge.

478
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.342
- And if we did what
Father Elbert suggested.

479
00:52:52.377 --> 00:52:54.773
find the bride's
remains. bless them. and-

480
00:52:54.808 --> 00:52:56.478
- Find the bride's
remains. bless them.

481
00:52:56.513 --> 00:52:57.512
and then bury them again.

482
00:52:59.384 --> 00:53:01.219
It's not going to
bring Seth back.

483
00:53:02.717 --> 00:53:05.652
And on the contrary. it risks
closing forever the link

484
00:53:05.687 --> 00:53:09.788
that is now open between our
world and the bride's world.

485
00:53:09.823 --> 00:53:12.791
- So how do we bring Seth back?

486
00:53:15.631 --> 00:53:18.368
- There is one thing
I think we can try.

487
00:53:18.403 --> 00:53:21.701
but you are going
to have to trust me.

488
00:53:21.736 --> 00:53:25.342
- I'm sorry. I should have
believed you from the start.

489
00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.775
- It can't have been
easy for you to believe.

490
00:53:34.419 --> 00:53:35.253
- Forgive me.

491
00:53:38.885 --> 00:53:41.556
Bring our son back. hmm?

492
00:53:42.757 --> 00:53:45.054
- Listen carefully. Alyson.

493
00:53:45.089 --> 00:53:47.463
You will meet many
souls on this journey.

494
00:53:48.895 --> 00:53:51.533
and some of them will
be familiar to you.

495
00:53:51.568 --> 00:53:53.799
others you will not recognize.

496
00:53:53.834 --> 00:53:58.001
Pay close attention to every
single one of them. okay?

497
00:53:58.036 --> 00:53:58.837
- Okay.

498
00:54:00.643 --> 00:54:02.808
- Now. this device will
sound to start your journey.

499
00:54:02.843 --> 00:54:05.382
It will also sound
to end the journey

500
00:54:05.417 --> 00:54:08.385
and bring you back to us.
and it's really important

501
00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.453
when that happens that
you have Seth with you.

502
00:54:10.488 --> 00:54:13.588
So if you find him. don't
let him out of your sight.

503
00:54:16.362 --> 00:54:18.329
You might need
this. hold onto it.

504
00:54:21.433 --> 00:54:23.664
You ready for everything
that's going to happen?

505
00:54:23.699 --> 00:54:25.402
- Yes.

506
00:54:25.437 --> 00:54:29.065
- Okay. in that case.
you can close your eyes.

507
00:54:49.659 --> 00:54:52.726
I want you to tell me
about a happy memory.

508
00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:56.466
- The birth of my child.

509
00:54:59.163 --> 00:55:01.570
- Where was he born.
who was with you. Alyson?

510
00:55:03.101 --> 00:55:04.738
- At the Craig General Hospital.

511
00:55:05.906 --> 00:55:07.807
Richard was there with me.

512
00:55:07.842 --> 00:55:11.107
- Okay. tell me more.
as much detail as you can.

513
00:55:12.847 --> 00:55:14.946
- I entered the operating room.

514
00:55:16.587 --> 00:55:20.721
My midwife was there with
me. laughing and joking.

515
00:55:22.186 --> 00:55:26.463
Then two big pushes. and
he came to the world.

516
00:55:28.192 --> 00:55:32.634
He was crying and they
placed him in my arms.

517
00:55:32.669 --> 00:55:37.441
and I started
crying. too.

518
00:55:37.476 --> 00:55:38.134
I kissed him.

519
00:55:42.514 --> 00:55:43.975
The moment I looked

520
00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:48.452
into his eyes was the most
beautiful moment of my life.

521
00:55:51.556 --> 00:55:56.152
Richard ran to me. tears
running down his face.

522
00:55:58.024 --> 00:56:01.531
and he hugged me. thanking me
for the son I have given him.

523
00:56:06.604 --> 00:56:09.869
- That's excellent.
that's really good. Alyson.

524
00:56:09.904 --> 00:56:14.544
Now keep that happy memory
with you as you start to relax.

525
00:56:14.579 --> 00:56:16.139
Take a nice big deep breath in.

526
00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:21.716
and relax. good. and in.

527
00:56:24.853 --> 00:56:25.687
and relax.

528
00:56:26.921 --> 00:56:28.151
And with each breath in.

529
00:56:28.186 --> 00:56:30.494
the body's going to
relax more and more.

530
00:56:33.026 --> 00:56:34.894
Be aware of how the sound

531
00:56:34.929 --> 00:56:37.798
you can hear also helps
the body feel more relaxed.

532
00:56:41.001 --> 00:56:42.704
Feel the fingers relax.

533
00:56:44.741 --> 00:56:46.972
Body starting to feel
a little heavier now.

534
00:56:47.007 --> 00:56:48.743
but it's a very
pleasant heaviness.

535
00:56:50.615 --> 00:56:53.176
Abandon yourself to those
sensations you're feeling.

536
00:56:54.751 --> 00:56:58.852
That's good. your
mind is active.

537
00:56:58.887 --> 00:57:01.657
but the body is feeling
a little heavier.

538
00:57:04.057 --> 00:57:05.529
And we breathe in.

539
00:57:07.995 --> 00:57:09.027
and we sleep.

540
00:57:10.998 --> 00:57:12.470
And we breathe in.

541
00:57:14.265 --> 00:57:15.572
and we sleep.

542
00:57:17.103 --> 00:57:18.542
And we breathe in.

543
00:57:20.744 --> 00:57:21.611
and we sleep.

544
00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:24.944
- Dave?

545
00:57:27.553 --> 00:57:28.486
What's happening?

546
00:57:31.249 --> 00:57:32.083
Nothing?

547
00:57:33.757 --> 00:57:34.591
It didn't work?

548
00:57:38.124 --> 00:57:38.958
Dave?

549
00:57:49.773 --> 00:57:50.607
Richard!

550
00:57:54.239 --> 00:57:55.810
Let me out of here!

551
00:57:59.651 --> 00:58:00.518
Dave. help!

552
00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:05.281
- And now?

553
00:58:05.316 --> 00:58:08.988
- Shh. now she's on her
journey. we need to wait.

554
00:58:09.991 --> 00:58:11.760
- Help!

555
00:59:15.419 --> 00:59:17.386
- And then she said to me
that she didn't want to go

556
00:59:17.421 --> 00:59:19.993
with them and that she
wanted to stay with us.

557
00:59:20.028 --> 00:59:22.699
So I whispered to her.
"I'm sorry. Alyson.

558
00:59:22.734 --> 00:59:25.064
I don't think
that's a good idea."

559
00:59:25.099 --> 00:59:28.903
And she replied. "Please.
Daddy. listen. please.

560
00:59:28.938 --> 00:59:30.872
Don't send me away with them."

561
00:59:33.437 --> 00:59:36.141
So I turned around. I was about
to close the door.

562
00:59:36.176 --> 00:59:39.749
and she looked at me
with tears in her eyes

563
00:59:39.784 --> 00:59:42.752
and said. "Bye bye.
Daddy. I love you."

564
00:59:46.021 --> 00:59:48.857
I know. I'll call her up
on the phone right now

565
00:59:48.892 --> 00:59:52.762
and say. "Bye bye. little
orphan girl. I love you."

566
00:59:54.832 --> 00:59:57.866
- No. that's not very nice.
you can't do that to her.

567
00:59:57.901 --> 01:00:00.099
- Seriously. so I can't write.

568
01:00:00.134 --> 01:00:02.101
"bye bye. little orphan
girl. I love you."

569
01:00:02.136 --> 01:00:04.367
on a piece of paper
and send it by fax?

570
01:00:04.402 --> 01:00:05.203
- No.

571
01:00:12.817 --> 01:00:15.411
- Wake up.
darling. wake up.

572
01:00:19.384 --> 01:00:20.856
- Mom?

573
01:00:25.093 --> 01:00:26.455
Mom.

574
01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:30.129
- Don't worry.
everything's fine.

575
01:00:30.164 --> 01:00:31.295
Everything's fine. honey.

576
01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:37.301
Oh. you must have had
a really bad dream.

577
01:00:37.336 --> 01:00:38.874
- I love you. Mom.

578
01:00:38.909 --> 01:00:40.711
- I love you. too.

579
01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.377
- But you're dead.

580
01:00:48.985 --> 01:00:50.446
- Sooner or later.
everybody dies.

581
01:00:53.187 --> 01:00:54.890
But that day is still far away.

582
01:00:58.896 --> 01:01:00.390
I came to bring you
a hot water bottle.

583
01:01:03.131 --> 01:01:03.965
You've wet the bed.

584
01:01:05.199 --> 01:01:07.001
- Oh. I'm sorry.

585
01:01:07.036 --> 01:01:09.806
- Don't worry. let
me change the sheets.

586
01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:12.105
- All right.

587
01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.910
- Don't worry. help
me change the sheets.

588
01:01:39.838 --> 01:01:41.167
- You seem nervous. Richard.

589
01:01:41.202 --> 01:01:42.333
- Thanks for noticing.

590
01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:45.809
- Everything's going as planned.

591
01:01:45.844 --> 01:01:47.536
- How long before
she comes back?

592
01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:49.373
- I don't know the
answer to that question.

593
01:01:51.014 --> 01:01:52.915
- How long does it normally
take in cases like this?

594
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:55.016
- I don't exactly do this
kind of thing every day.

595
01:01:56.415 --> 01:01:58.382
- How often have you
done something similar?

596
01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:03.321
Christ.

597
01:02:06.161 --> 01:02:08.491
- Richard. there's something
in my brown bad I think I need.

598
01:02:08.526 --> 01:02:10.999
It's in the bedroom.
will you get it for me?

599
01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.443
- Dave. Dave. you
need to let me out.

600
01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:03.953
Dave?

601
01:04:07.447 --> 01:04:09.953
- Good night. darling.

602
01:04:11.154 --> 01:04:14.155
- Mommy. who
are you talking to?

603
01:04:35.244 --> 01:04:38.916
- Eve. my princess.

604
01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:46.385
You didn't have to die.

605
01:04:48.554 --> 01:04:50.158
My little princess.

606
01:04:55.726 --> 01:04:58.397
It's all your fault!

607
01:05:14.085 --> 01:05:17.548
It began with me. and
with me. it shall end.

608
01:05:21.653 --> 01:05:23.158
Forgive me. Susan.

609
01:05:41.607 --> 01:05:42.441
- Richard?

610
01:05:46.249 --> 01:05:47.083
Richard?

611
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:59.590
Richard?

612
01:06:16.411 --> 01:06:17.245
Richard!

613
01:06:19.513 --> 01:06:21.150
Richard. don't
look at the light!

614
01:06:24.353 --> 01:06:24.780
Richard!

615
01:06:26.619 --> 01:06:28.289
Richard. we've got
to get out of here.

616
01:06:49.246 --> 01:06:50.806
I'm protecting this
woman with sacred herbs.

617
01:06:50.841 --> 01:06:52.280
No evil spirits may harm her.

618
01:06:54.548 --> 01:06:56.812
I am protecting this
woman with sacred herbs.

619
01:06:56.847 --> 01:06:59.452
No evil spirits may harm her.

620
01:06:59.487 --> 01:07:01.586
I am protecting this
woman with sacred herbs.

621
01:07:01.621 --> 01:07:03.324
No evil spirits may harm her.

622
01:07:03.359 --> 01:07:05.491
I am protecting this woman
with sacred herbs. no-

623
01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:11.629
I'm protecting this
woman with sacred herbs.

624
01:07:11.664 --> 01:07:14.467
No evil spirits may harm her.

625
01:07:14.502 --> 01:07:16.370
I'm protecting this
woman with sacred herbs.

626
01:07:16.405 --> 01:07:18.207
No evil spirits may harm her.

627
01:07:21.839 --> 01:07:23.179
Come on. Alyson.

628
01:07:24.677 --> 01:07:25.511
Come on.

629
01:08:35.781 --> 01:08:39.222
- Alyson. it's good
to see you again.

630
01:08:40.753 --> 01:08:42.555
You've grown up to
be a beautiful woman.

631
01:08:46.297 --> 01:08:48.858
I never should have
sent you away from me.

632
01:08:48.893 --> 01:08:51.960
- I always hoped you would
have come and get me.

633
01:08:51.995 --> 01:08:53.797
that I would have
seen you again.

634
01:08:53.832 --> 01:08:55.568
- I made a terrible mistake.

635
01:08:56.934 --> 01:08:59.539
I left my only joy in
the hands of others.

636
01:09:01.246 --> 01:09:03.180
But now we can
make up for things.

637
01:09:10.783 --> 01:09:15.588
We'll be together again.
me. you. your mother.

638
01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:18.261
- No.

639
01:09:18.296 --> 01:09:21.396
- Yes. we'll be a family again.

640
01:09:21.431 --> 01:09:23.563
- I. I came to look for my son.

641
01:09:23.598 --> 01:09:26.665
- I know. and I can't
wait to meet him.

642
01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:30.207
- It's not possible.
Dad. we're not staying.

643
01:09:31.771 --> 01:09:33.276
I'm taking him away from here.

644
01:09:34.642 --> 01:09:37.841
- Losing your daughter
is a painful experience.

645
01:09:39.779 --> 01:09:41.911
Losing her twice
is heartbreaking.

646
01:09:44.553 --> 01:09:48.819
I was a terrible father
and an even worse husband.

647
01:09:49.921 --> 01:09:52.295
but I can make up for that now.

648
01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:54.924
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

649
01:09:54.959 --> 01:09:58.334
- It can't happen. not anymore.

650
01:10:00.338 --> 01:10:02.800
We weren't together
when we could have been.

651
01:10:02.835 --> 01:10:04.307
We can't be together now.

652
01:10:07.873 --> 01:10:08.707
Dad.

653
01:10:10.546 --> 01:10:11.380
please.

654
01:10:12.746 --> 01:10:13.877
Help me find Seth.

655
01:10:15.617 --> 01:10:17.485
Please.

656
01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.555
- When you were younger. you
always used to enjoy drawing.

657
01:10:22.954 --> 01:10:23.788
Do you remember?

658
01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:27.693
It was your way
of communicating.

659
01:10:29.763 --> 01:10:33.666
I never understood any of
your drawings. how could I?

660
01:10:37.474 --> 01:10:39.573
Perhaps one of them will
help you to find your son.

661
01:10:41.038 --> 01:10:45.040
Alyson. go now. there
isn't much time left.

662
01:10:45.075 --> 01:10:45.909
- Thank you. Dad.

663
01:11:42.165 --> 01:11:44.506
- You forced me
to make a choice.

664
01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:48.070
- You're scaring me. why
are you doing this to me?

665
01:11:49.106 --> 01:11:51.645
- You don't remember anything?

666
01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.418
- No. I don't know what
you're talking about.

667
01:11:59.457 --> 01:12:00.720
- I am so sorry.

668
01:12:00.755 --> 01:12:03.492
- Nelson. darling.
look at me. it's me.

669
01:12:04.792 --> 01:12:06.429
your love. your wife.

670
01:12:07.696 --> 01:12:11.962
Let's go back home. I'm
begging you.

671
01:12:11.997 --> 01:12:12.831
I'm pregnant!

672
01:12:22.513 --> 01:12:25.613
I will devour your soul and
the souls of the ones you love.

673
01:12:25.648 --> 01:12:29.683
dead son of a bitch.
you'll never be free of me.

674
01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:44.500
In the darkness. I
will slaughter your
children like pigs.

675
01:13:49.963 --> 01:13:51.732
We won't let you go.

676
01:13:51.767 --> 01:13:52.931
We won't let you go. Alyson.

677
01:13:53.934 --> 01:13:54.933
We are a family now.

678
01:13:56.299 --> 01:13:58.937
We are a family. we
won't let you go.

679
01:13:58.972 --> 01:14:01.577
We won't let you go. Alyson.

680
01:14:01.612 --> 01:14:02.237
- We are a family now.

681
01:14:03.779 --> 01:14:06.747
- Relax and breathe.

682
01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:09.783
Relax and breathe.

683
01:14:25.834 --> 01:14:27.064
- Oh. you're okay.

684
01:14:27.099 --> 01:14:27.999
- My baby.

685
01:14:28.034 --> 01:14:30.606
- Okay. and deep breaths.

686
01:14:30.641 --> 01:14:31.640
- He was with me. he was-
- I know.

687
01:14:31.675 --> 01:14:33.103
- He was here with me.

688
01:14:33.138 --> 01:14:37.239
- Try to stay calm. that's
better. that's better.

689
01:14:39.309 --> 01:14:40.979
- She took him away from me.

690
01:14:41.014 --> 01:14:41.914
- I'm sorry. Alyson.

691
01:14:44.314 --> 01:14:45.819
- Send me back.

692
01:14:45.854 --> 01:14:46.281
- I can't.

693
01:14:47.922 --> 01:14:48.822
- I have to go back.

694
01:14:48.857 --> 01:14:50.285
- It's too dangerous.

695
01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.794
- No. I. he. I have. I have
to go back and get him.

696
01:14:53.829 --> 01:14:56.324
- Sending you once was risky.
I shouldn't have done it.

697
01:14:56.359 --> 01:14:58.095
Sending you twice
could kill you.

698
01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:59.899
- I don't care. you
have to send me-

699
01:14:59.934 --> 01:15:00.768
- I care.

700
01:15:03.102 --> 01:15:03.734
I care.

701
01:15:05.137 --> 01:15:08.270
- You don't understand. he was.

702
01:15:08.305 --> 01:15:11.911
he was with me. he
was here with me.

703
01:15:11.946 --> 01:15:12.582
- Alyson.

704
01:15:14.718 --> 01:15:17.851
You did everything you
could possibly have done.

705
01:15:23.826 --> 01:15:27.696
Wait. Aly. Alyson. wait. it
might not be safe. Alyson!

706
01:15:29.161 --> 01:15:29.995
- Richard?

707
01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:34.835
- I have to thank you
once more for our baby.

708
01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:12.202
- Richard.

709
01:16:12.237 --> 01:16:13.071
- Dave.

710
01:16:14.943 --> 01:16:16.239
I was wondering when you
would have come to see us.

711
01:16:16.274 --> 01:16:17.713
- Well. I was in
the neighborhood.

712
01:16:17.748 --> 01:16:19.682
I thought I'd pass by.
just in time. I see.

713
01:16:19.717 --> 01:16:21.948
- Yeah. we're leaving
this afternoon.

714
01:16:21.983 --> 01:16:24.082
The estate agent will take care
of all the other furniture.

715
01:16:24.117 --> 01:16:26.018
- Good. where are you moving to?

716
01:16:26.053 --> 01:16:28.284
- Oh. we found a small
place on the East Coast.

717
01:16:28.319 --> 01:16:30.891
- Nice. how are they both?

718
01:16:30.926 --> 01:16:32.189
- They couldn't be better.

719
01:16:32.224 --> 01:16:34.290
Alyson is a completely
different person now.

720
01:16:34.325 --> 01:16:35.225
much more serene.

721
01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:37.029
- Excellent. are they home?

722
01:16:37.064 --> 01:16:37.700
- Yes. they are.

723
01:16:39.033 --> 01:16:41.231
Anyway. I. I never thanked you

724
01:16:41.266 --> 01:16:42.837
for what you did for my family.

725
01:16:45.402 --> 01:16:46.907
- Still can't get
used to being thanked.

726
01:16:46.942 --> 01:16:49.976
I'm using being called
a charlatan.

727
01:16:50.011 --> 01:16:51.813
- I can imagine.

728
01:16:51.848 --> 01:16:53.914
So I'll finish up here
and I'll see you inside.

729
01:16:53.949 --> 01:16:54.750
- Yeah.

730
01:17:03.992 --> 01:17:04.419
Alyson?

731
01:17:12.231 --> 01:17:13.098
Alyson?

732
01:17:28.016 --> 01:17:29.477
Hey. Seth.

733
01:17:29.512 --> 01:17:33.723
Hey. hello. little
man. where's mommy?

734
01:17:35.221 --> 01:17:36.891
You don't know?

735
01:17:38.961 --> 01:17:40.455
Hey. you want to play?

736
01:17:41.964 --> 01:17:43.260
You haven't got any toys.

737
01:17:43.295 --> 01:17:45.328
Hey. where are your toys?

738
01:17:47.332 --> 01:17:49.068
I've got something. hang on.

739
01:17:49.103 --> 01:17:50.300
It's not exactly a toy. but.

740
01:17:59.245 --> 01:18:01.014
- Hey. Dave.

741
01:18:01.049 --> 01:18:02.180
- Hey. hi.

742
01:18:04.349 --> 01:18:05.953
- When did you arrive?

743
01:18:05.988 --> 01:18:08.318
- Just now. I did call
out. you didn't hear me?

744
01:18:08.353 --> 01:18:12.124
- Oh. no. I was
upstairs. finishing
packing all our things.

745
01:18:12.159 --> 01:18:15.325
- Right. I just
came to say goodbye.

746
01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.733
- That's nice of you.

747
01:18:19.804 --> 01:18:21.298
Is everything okay?

748
01:18:21.333 --> 01:18:22.871
- Yeah. everything's fine.

749
01:18:24.468 --> 01:18:28.305
Um. look. I have
to. I have to go.

750
01:18:30.342 --> 01:18:31.506
- You seem worried.

751
01:18:31.541 --> 01:18:33.475
- Worried? No.

752
01:18:34.918 --> 01:18:35.752
Should I be?

753
01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:37.754
- No.

754
01:18:41.991 --> 01:18:44.222
Aren't you a bit old to
be playing with marbles?

755
01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:53.495
- Oh. I think you're
much older than I am.

756
01:18:55.433 --> 01:19:00.205
- This is the last one.
