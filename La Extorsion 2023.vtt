00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.800
Charo. how are you?
Wait for me in the lobby.

4
00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.051
We will go out to eat.

5
00:00:56.347 --> 00:00:59.976
As you wish. I'll wait for you here.
Although it's quite crowded. Kisses.

6
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:19.996
That's weird.
I'm going to do it right now.

7
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.670
So you're going to Madrid tomorrow
evening. we can't meet then.

8
00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:45.188
Yes. I am here.
You've caught me at a bad time.

9
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.232
I'm in a mess. I'm leaving for Madrid.

10
00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.944
Yes. the car should already be
waiting for me at the door.

11
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.447
This is a mess.
I leave it in your hands.

12
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.448
You organize it.

13
00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:58.116
All right. Okay. Okay.

14
00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.037
I'm leaving for Ezeiza.

15
00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.540
Yeah. the car should already
be waiting for me at my door.

16
00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:05.041
I'm already late.

17
00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.919
Okay. okay.
I'll talk to you another time.

18
00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:10.672
Move forward slowly.

19
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:12.882
Yes. no problem.

20
00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:16.845
You call me. okay?

21
00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:20.598
Yes. no problem.
Call me and we'll coordinate. okay?

22
00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.267
What's up. Novack?

23
00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:39.450
THE EXTORTION

24
00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.791
Good evening. ladies and gentlemen.

25
00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:50.545
This is Captain
Alejandro Petrossián speaking.

26
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.173
We expect to begin our descent
in approximately ten minutes.

27
00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.301
with clear skies

28
00:02:56.384 --> 00:03:00.930
and the temperature in Buenos Aires
at 82 degrees Fahrenheit.

29
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:05.643
We ask that you please remain seated
with your seatbelts fastened

30
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.771
and take a moment to greet
the person next to you.

31
00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:12.775
as it is now midnight on January 1st.

32
00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.903
On behalf of Sudeste Airlines

33
00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:19.032
and our entire crew.
we wish you a very happy new year.

34
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.416
-Happy New Year. my friend.
-Happy New Year.

35
00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:29.417
Let's go.

36
00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.506
Who are you spending the New Year with?

37
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.843
-I'm going to see my girl...
-Attention. Captain Petrossián.

38
00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.428
Hey.

39
00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.475
-Happy New Year. fatty.
-Happy New Year. Alejandro.

40
00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:49.020
-This is Captain Fernando Marconi.
-How do you do? Excuse me.

41
00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:50.605
How long have we been flying together?

42
00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:52.982
26 years in August.

43
00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:56.194
And we grew up in the same neighborhood.
It's been 40 years of friendship.

44
00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:58.196
-Shut up.
-Better shut up. yes.

45
00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:02.575
Andrés Sadik was promoted
two months ago.

46
00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.995
A new player.
Welcome to the major league.

47
00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.038
Thank you very much.

48
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:08.498
I'm going to go buy something.
You guys go on without me.

49
00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.540
Okay.

50
00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.793
They presented a new uniform.

51
00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.294
Gino Callegari designed it.

52
00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:16.589
Thank goodness they didn't go with it.
Wel. they haven't said no yet...

53
00:04:17.214 --> 00:04:18.341
Good evening.

54
00:04:18.423 --> 00:04:20.677
Hello. honey. You finally made it.

55
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.678
Hi. darling.

56
00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:23.888
-Hi.
-Hi.

57
00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.098
Pedro Greco. You know each other. right?

58
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.850
No. I didn't have the pleasure.
but I heard a lot about you.

59
00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.352
You're a legend.

60
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.438
-Domestic flights?
-International pilot.

61
00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.899
But here in the region.
mostly Chile and Brazil.

62
00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.193
So. domestic. yeah. yeah.

63
00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.488
Yes. he stayed to keep me company
until you arrived. He's a sweetheart.

64
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:42.907
How nice. Thank you very much. Pedro.

65
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.201
-It's nothing.
-You're such a sweetheart.

66
00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:46.286
Well. I'm here.

67
00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.371
Yes. of course. I'll leave you.
It was a pleasure.

68
00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.081
-My pleasure as well.
-All right.

69
00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:51.832
-Really.
-Thank you. Pedro.

70
00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:52.875
-Excuse me.
-And thank you very much

71
00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.961
-for keeping her company. Truly.
-Don't mention it.

72
00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:56.170
-You're too kind.
-Thank you.

73
00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.464
Goodbye. Have a nice day.
And happy new year. buddy.

74
00:04:58.548 --> 00:04:59.674
-Thank you.
-Happy New Year.

75
00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:02.051
-You are unbelievable.
-He stayed to keep you company?

76
00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.387
It's January 1st and he stayed
to keep you company?

77
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.763
He has no family. no friends.

78
00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.015
You have no idea
how well I know his type.

79
00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:08.433
Like looking in a mirror?

80
00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:09.434
All right.

81
00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:11.519
Happy New Year. my love.

82
00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:12.895
Happy New Year.

83
00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.731
No. no. no. no. no.

84
00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:19.652
A captain kissing a flight attendant
from the company? Please.

85
00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:20.820
What do you have there?

86
00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.073
Why not toast?

87
00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.616
You have to fly.

88
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.202
Just a toast. nothing more.
Just don't say anything.

89
00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:31.080
I want to toast to the two of you.

90
00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.832
-Okay.
-For this love story

91
00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.378
that overcame difficulties.
perhaps some bumps in the road.

92
00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:38.963
What are you talking about?

93
00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.424
-I'm just happy.
-And you say that?

94
00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:44.761
Here's to the two of you
and this beautiful love story.

95
00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.262
-Okay.
-Here's to friendship.

96
00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.764
-To friendship.
-To the three of us.

97
00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.099
-Sounds perfect.
-Let's toast once and for all.

98
00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.060
-Cheers.
-I'm sorry. Cheers.

99
00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:17.668
Are you expecting someone?

100
00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.755
Who am I going to expect at 7:00 a.m.?

101
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.591
Go check.

102
00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:29.305
Alejandro Petrossián?

103
00:06:30.264 --> 00:06:31.224
Yes. it's me.

104
00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:34.393
Eugenio Cristaldo.
General Management of Airport Security.

105
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.521
I need to ask you some questions.

106
00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.816
Can you please show me
some identification?

107
00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:47.615
What happened?

108
00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:49.200
We still don't know.
That's why we're here.

109
00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:50.993
Would you be so kind as to come with us?

110
00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.829
Where to? It is a holiday.

111
00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.957
To Ezeiza. to my office.
It is just to clear up some doubts.

112
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.166
Can't you clear your doubts here?

113
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.377
Ma'am. why don't you go
to bed and keep on sleeping?

114
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.504
Who are you to give my wife an order?

115
00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:02.797
Have you lost your mind?

116
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.258
I don't have any problem going with you.
but It's a holiday today. sir.

117
00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:08.261
It can't be that you show
up at my house like this.

118
00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.388
Can't it be on Monday.
when I have to go to Ezeiza?

119
00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:12.890
If it could have been on Monday.
we would have come on Monday.

120
00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:17.019
Well. get going
and I'll follow you in my car.

121
00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.855
Better get dressed and come with us.

122
00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:25.486
Well. all right.
I'll get changed and go.

123
00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:29.699
-Alejandro. no. Where are you going?
-I don't know what's going on.

124
00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:32.659
These guys show up at my house
and ask me to go with them.

125
00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:34.203
I'll call you when I get there.
so don't worry.

126
00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.580
I don't know what happened.

127
00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:42.628
Can you explain what is happening?
Is there a problem. guys? What is it?

128
00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.213
Maybe.

129
00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:47.008
Are these your psychophysical tests
from the past year and a half?

130
00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:51.387
Yes. it looks like it.

131
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.474
There's your doctor's signature
certifying that you're fit to fly.

132
00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.058
Yes.

133
00:07:58.102 --> 00:07:59.896
-What are you doing?
-What's he doing?

134
00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:01.731
What are you doing?

135
00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.941
Did you think we wouldn't find out?

136
00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.401
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

137
00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:06.819
It's better not to lie.

138
00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:09.488
but to tell the truth. We'll help you.

139
00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.325
Better us than the airport police.

140
00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.620
You are not police?

141
00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:18.831
A white lie not to worry your wife.

142
00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:21.334
Who are you?

143
00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:44.649
I'm going to need your phone.

144
00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:46.859
-Why?
-For security reasons.

145
00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.069
You cannot enter
this area with your phone.

146
00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:50.112
I'll give it back to you when you leave.

147
00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:01.582
Come on. come on. come on.

148
00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:06.337
Are you guys exaggerating a bit?
This seems like a bit much.

149
00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.006
First time you are tested?

150
00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:12.301
-Yes.
-Please say it out loud.

151
00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:14.804
Yes.

152
00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:20.977
Are you nervous?

153
00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:24.605
Don't be nervous.
Everything will be fine.

154
00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:28.067
-Can I call you by your first name?
-Yes.

155
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.068
Thank you.

156
00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.862
You probably don't understand
why you're here. right?

157
00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.030
Right.

158
00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:36.242
We're members
of the National Intelligence Services.

159
00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:39.370
operating
within the limits of the airport.

160
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:41.247
You'll know me as Saavedra.

161
00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:45.293
you've already met Beltramino.
and Cristaldo.

162
00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:49.505
The thing is. we're going to ask you
some questions

163
00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:51.465
to which we already know the answers.

164
00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:56.596
The idea is to establish a pattern.
so when you lie. your body alerts us.

165
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.597
Okay. I'm not going to lie anyway.

166
00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:00.766
All right. we'll see.

167
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.021
-Please. answer only with yes or no.
-Okay.

168
00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:06.689
Nothing else. okay? Can we get started?

169
00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:08.149
-Yes.
-Okay.

170
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.694
-Is your name Alejandro Petrossián?
-Yes.

171
00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:13.863
Are you 58 years old?

172
00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:14.864
Yes.

173
00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:19.368
Did you start working
at Sudeste Airlines in 1995?

174
00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.704
At the end of '94.
when it was about to...

175
00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:23.581
-Please excuse me. you told me...
-There is no need to be so formal.

176
00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:27.793
Okay. You told me to simply
answer yes or no. So. yes.

177
00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.713
Is your partner's name
Carolina Guerrero?

178
00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.800
What's that got to do with this?

179
00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.594
Please answer the question out loud.

180
00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.263
Is your partner's name
Carolina Guerrero?

181
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:41.599
Yes.

182
00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.895
Did you meet her at the airline
ten years ago?

183
00:10:48.272 --> 00:10:49.273
Yes. so?

184
00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.109
Did you have sexual relations
with another woman

185
00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:53.611
while you were with Carolina?

186
00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:01.911
No.

187
00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:07.124
I'll ask you again.
please answer truthfully.

188
00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.794
Did you have sexual relations
with another woman

189
00:11:09.877 --> 00:11:11.253
while you were with Carolina?

190
00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:14.423
Yes.

191
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.758
Was she also a flight attendant?

192
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.009
Does it matter?

193
00:11:18.719 --> 00:11:22.098
I'm asking you again. was the other
woman also a flight attendant?

194
00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:23.933
No.

195
00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:25.184
Is she a doctor?

196
00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:32.274
Is it her?

197
00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.826
Is her name Andrea Vitale?

198
00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.709
Well. let's move on to another question.

199
00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:58.926
Is Dr. Vitale authorized to be
your aviation medical examiner or not?

200
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.177
Yes.

201
00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:06.016
A year and a half ago. Dr. Vitale
diagnosed you with hearing loss

202
00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:11.397
in your right ear due to otospongiosis.

203
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.481
-Is that correct?
-No.

204
00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.775
I'll make it simpler for you.

205
00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:16.819
-Are you going deaf?
-No.

206
00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:20.072
Did you ask
Dr. Vitale to hide your illness?

207
00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:21.532
-No.
-Did you bribe her?

208
00:12:21.615 --> 00:12:23.451
-No.
-Do you know that you can go to jail

209
00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:26.579
for flying without being fit to do so?
You could be in for up to six years.

210
00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:29.290
What is this? Do I need a lawyer?

211
00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:32.293
Where do you get these questions from?

212
00:12:32.376 --> 00:12:34.587
You can't force me
to say something that isn't true.

213
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.589
If you don't tell me the truth.
I can't help you.

214
00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:38.841
But. wait. wait. wait.

215
00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.552
I hear just as well
or better than you do.

216
00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:45.848
and I don't give a damn
about whether a paper.

217
00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:48.517
a study or anything else says otherwise.

218
00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:52.271
A passenger flies much safer
with me than with any other pilot.

219
00:12:52.354 --> 00:12:54.190
and you can be sure of that.

220
00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:55.733
What kind of madness is this?

221
00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:59.445
Losing a 30-year career just because.
yes. I hear a little less in one ear.

222
00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:03.115
but I have never come close
to having an accident.

223
00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.825
I hear alarms perfectly well.

224
00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:06.869
Am I going to screw up
my life because of that?

225
00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:08.913
Am I going to stop working
as if I were an old man?

226
00:13:08.996 --> 00:13:10.748
-Alejandro...
-Don't give me that.

227
00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:13.876
All my life...

228
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.879
I have worked hard to get where I am.

229
00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.509
I don't work as a pilot. I am a pilot.

230
00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:24.553
and I know perfectly well
what I can and can't do.

231
00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:30.309
I agree with you.

232
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.485
Take it as a gesture of goodwill.

233
00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:45.032
Good morning. Santa Clara Taxis.

234
00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:47.701
No. we don't have any cars
at the moment.

235
00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:49.745
Now what?

236
00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:50.996
Now what?

237
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.540
What happens now?
Are you going to report me?

238
00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:54.750
We could report you.

239
00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:59.588
You could defend yourself in court.
lose your license. go to jail.

240
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.218
not to mention the doctor who would
never work again in her life.

241
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.929
Or you could do something
much easier for you.

242
00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:08.764
We'd rather you keep flying.

243
00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:11.058
Yeah? Why?

244
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:12.142
Because we all win.

245
00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:13.811
You keep your job.

246
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.730
and you help us by taking
something out of the country.

247
00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:18.607
Something? What something?

248
00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:20.109
Just a suitcase.

249
00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:21.610
A suitcase with what?

250
00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:22.778
Her wife called several times.

251
00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:24.405
Did you answer?

252
00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:25.823
This is our contact number.

253
00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.284
Write it down. and don't call us.

254
00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:29.952
We'll contact you.

255
00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:33.789
Wait. What if I don't want
to take that suitcase?

256
00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:37.334
You don't have to answer that now.
Think about it.

257
00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:43.632
It's nothing.

258
00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.175
They're investigating a pilot

259
00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:50.180
from another airline who performed
a strange maneuver on the runway.

260
00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:52.349
and they want the opinion
of someone with experience.

261
00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:53.976
-That's all.
-Goddamn it.

262
00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:57.229
-Why couldn't they tell us?
-I will be home in a little while.

263
00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:58.314
I love you.

264
00:14:58.397 --> 00:14:59.315
I love you.

265
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:23.088
Raise your hand every time
you hear a sound

266
00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:25.674
on the side where you hear it. okay?
Let's start with the right side.

267
00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:30.679
Who did you talk to?
Who did you talk to. Andrea?

268
00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:32.848
-What's wrong. Alejandro?
-Please tell me.

269
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:34.558
Stop. Can you give me a second?

270
00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:36.143
-Come. come.
-What happened?

271
00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:39.730
Wait. you idiot. how could you
barge into the my office like that?

272
00:15:39.813 --> 00:15:42.441
I didn't talk to anyone.
What happened? Did your wife find out?

273
00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:47.154
Tell me the truth.
Did they offer you money or what?

274
00:15:47.946 --> 00:15:51.158
-Who are you talking about?
-They have everything. Everything.

275
00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:53.869
The audiometric tests. the MRIs.
the real ones.

276
00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:55.245
Wait. Who? The airline?

277
00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:57.247
-The Services.
-What services?

278
00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:58.874
National Intelligence Services. Andrea.

279
00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:01.085
What do you have to do
with the Intelligence Services?

280
00:16:01.168 --> 00:16:02.378
Nothing. but they are pressuring

281
00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:03.712
me because they want me
to cooperate with them.

282
00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:05.089
Please help me.

283
00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:08.926
No. you have to help me.
If they have those files...

284
00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:11.303
If...

285
00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:14.098
If you go down. I go down too.

286
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.766
For this very reason.
Since you are my doctor.

287
00:16:15.849 --> 00:16:17.559
you have to say that they falsified
your results.

288
00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:18.852
That you were set up and that's it.

289
00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:20.604
Sure. it was all a sham. a big sham.

290
00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:21.897
And then. when they do a study on you.

291
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.774
they'll find out that you're deafer
than Beethoven. you son of a bitch?

292
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.235
-Can you stop thinking about yourself?
-I...

293
00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:28.112
I mean. I did you a favor
and now you're leaving me on my own?

294
00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:29.321
I don't...

295
00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:32.074
Alejandro. this is not just your career.
it's mine too.

296
00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:33.075
I know.

297
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:36.078
I will lose everything
and they will put me in jail.

298
00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:37.496
They will put us in jail.

299
00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:40.165
-What are you going to do?
-I don't know.

300
00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:41.709
God.

301
00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:43.502
What the hell are you going to do?

302
00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:10.440
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

303
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:12.943
-Bravo. little bird!
-Bravo!

304
00:19:13.026 --> 00:19:14.403
Bravo!

305
00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:19.032
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

306
00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:21.660
If it were up to me.
I would fly another 100 years.

307
00:19:21.743 --> 00:19:24.663
but against my ID.
there's nothing to do.

308
00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:27.416
The document marks
that you have to stop.

309
00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:29.751
and you have to stop.

310
00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:33.922
-Come on. don't keep quiet.
-Bravo!

311
00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.465
There is life after the plane.

312
00:19:37.175 --> 00:19:38.802
Cut off his tie.

313
00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:42.431
That's it!

314
00:19:44.224 --> 00:19:45.183
Give me a hug.

315
00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:48.353
Are you okay?

316
00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:50.856
-Yes.
-Yeah?

317
00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.025
Come on. let's go. Let's celebrate.

318
00:19:56.987 --> 00:19:58.614
Have a drink. I'll be right back.

319
00:19:58.697 --> 00:19:59.698
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

320
00:20:04.202 --> 00:20:05.621
-Would you like a drink?
-No.

321
00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:06.622
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

322
00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:10.709
The theme of water is beautiful.
eye-catching.

323
00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:16.048
Although it seems kind of stupid.
What does so much water mean?

324
00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:17.966
Sorry to say that.

325
00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:20.552
It's a ritual.

326
00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:24.306
Low flight.
crossing water arches. tie cuts.

327
00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.808
It's just a way of saying goodbye.

328
00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.270
Each job must have its own.

329
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.147
Mine doesn't.

330
00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:34.816
You never retire from this.

331
00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:39.571
Did you think about what I proposed?

332
00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:42.824
Yes. I've been thinking about it
quite a bit.

333
00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.076
I hope you don't take it the wrong way.

334
00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:47.120
but the truth is. I don't really
understand why you need me.

335
00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:48.997
Why doesn't one of you do the job?

336
00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:52.334
Yes. one of our guys used to do it.
but he is not with us anymore.

337
00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:53.835
and nobody wanted to replace him.

338
00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:56.588
Imagine making so many trips.

339
00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:58.173
It's suspicious.
and you are too exposed.

340
00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:00.592
So then I am exposed?

341
00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:01.969
No. you're not exposed.

342
00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:05.263
In your case.
making frequent trips isn't suspicious.

343
00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:06.390
It's your job.

344
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:08.892
With a plus. of course.

345
00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:10.560
Carrying just one suitcase.

346
00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:11.687
Nothing more.

347
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.689
Although. there are some details.

348
00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:17.025
From now on. forget about Rome.
Miami. New York.

349
00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:21.488
Your exclusive route is Madrid.
The rest doesn't have much mystery.

350
00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:25.325
We'll give you a suitcase here.
and you deliver it there. and that's it.

351
00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:28.036
You can live your life
until the next trip.

352
00:21:29.454 --> 00:21:31.206
What do you mean by next trip?
Isn't it just one?

353
00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:33.375
We have to get more
than one suitcase out.

354
00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:34.793
I can't tell you how many.

355
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.052
Let's see. if I do it. if I cooperate.
will you leave me alone?

356
00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:48.974
That is to say. no more pictures.
no more cars in front of my house.

357
00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:52.352
You guys stop bothering me
and I can keep flying?

358
00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.105
Let me tell you how it would work.

359
00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:59.234
This is how it works.
They'll pick you up as usual.

360
00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:00.485
Take your carry on.

361
00:22:01.945 --> 00:22:02.863
Hello.

362
00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:04.448
Morning.

363
00:22:04.531 --> 00:22:08.076
We'll put our suitcase
in your locker in the pilot's lounge.

364
00:22:15.792 --> 00:22:17.878
It'll have a cow sticker.

365
00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:21.173
You'll take it and leave yours inside.

366
00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:28.555
Keep the suitcase with you at all times.

367
00:22:28.638 --> 00:22:29.931
Don't lose sight of it.

368
00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:34.311
Don't worry about airport security.

369
00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:37.105
They won't touch you.
neither here nor in Spain.

370
00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:44.404
Captain.

371
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:47.616
can I see your suitcase?

372
00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:04.382
Do you want me to store it for you?

373
00:23:04.466 --> 00:23:06.051
Excuse me. I didn't hear you.

374
00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:09.888
Yes. I noticed you were distracted.
Do you want me to store it for you?

375
00:23:09.971 --> 00:23:10.972
Okay.

376
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:18.897
As soon as you arrive in Madrid.

377
00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.149
you'll pass through customs
without any problems.

378
00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:23.110
Go to the bathroom on the first floor.

379
00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:25.654
and Porchietto. one of our guys.

380
00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:27.739
will be waiting there
to make the switch.

381
00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:29.199
Couldn't they find someone
dumber for the job?

382
00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:31.618
Sorry. I didn't know how to get here.

383
00:23:31.701 --> 00:23:32.661
Come on. hurry up. I don't have all day.

384
00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:33.703
Yes. I'm sorry.

385
00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:36.373
You go out first.

386
00:23:36.456 --> 00:23:37.582
-Yes.
-Hurry.

387
00:23:40.627 --> 00:23:42.671
And that's it. Until the next trip.

388
00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.633
You go back to the hotel
and live your life. It's easy.

389
00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:01.606
SANTA CLARA TAXIS

390
00:24:04.776 --> 00:24:05.735
Hello?

391
00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:07.487
Yes. you have
a call from Santa Clara Taxis.

392
00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:08.655
I'll patch you through.

393
00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:10.740
You see. it's not that bad.

394
00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:13.034
Well. it's not that easy either.

395
00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:15.245
All right. listen. this is important.

396
00:24:15.328 --> 00:24:18.540
When we call you.
we'll say "Santa Clara Taxis."

397
00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:20.625
If you say you didn't ask for any taxis.

398
00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:23.420
we'll know you're in trouble.
and we'll come to find you.

399
00:24:23.795 --> 00:24:25.964
Your safety is our priority. all right?

400
00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:28.758
-Yes. but...
-But nothing.

401
00:24:28.842 --> 00:24:30.719
I am trying to be as clear as possible

402
00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:32.429
because I don't want
any surprises later.

403
00:24:32.512 --> 00:24:36.474
If you have any problems.
you talk to us and only us.

404
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.728
Please tell me what you understood
to put my mind at ease.

405
00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:42.063
Yes. I understand. It's just that...

406
00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:44.900
Hello?

407
00:24:45.483 --> 00:24:46.401
Hello?

408
00:25:08.006 --> 00:25:09.174
Alejandro. is everything all right?

409
00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:11.343
Yes. everything is fine.

410
00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:15.972
Something wrong?

411
00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:17.599
No.

412
00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:30.153
Yes. yes.

413
00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:40.497
-How is it going. Alejandro?
-How are you. Camilo?

414
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.498
-Fine. fine.
-Yeah?

415
00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:42.791
Yeah.

416
00:25:59.474 --> 00:26:02.310
-How is it going?
-Fine. Fine.

417
00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:04.271
Did you go out last night?

418
00:26:04.646 --> 00:26:06.106
Just a little bit.

419
00:26:06.189 --> 00:26:07.399
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

420
00:26:11.945 --> 00:26:14.072
Hello. Alejandro. how are you?

421
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.574
You haven't been coming
to the stadium anymore.

422
00:26:16.658 --> 00:26:18.576
the guys are asking about you.

423
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:20.996
Well. now shut up
and keep walking. okay?

424
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:34.342
Excuse me. sir.
would you please come with us?

425
00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:35.427
Something wrong?

426
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.053
Come with us
and they will explain everything to you.

427
00:26:37.137 --> 00:26:38.847
-Okay. but don't touch me.
-Please come with us.

428
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.724
-Don't touch me. Don't touch me.
-This way.

429
00:26:40.807 --> 00:26:43.184
I'll come with you but don't touch me.
I said don't touch me.

430
00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:45.854
-Come with us.
-Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

431
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.197
Hello.

432
00:26:57.365 --> 00:26:58.408
Do you know who I am?

433
00:26:58.491 --> 00:26:59.492
No.

434
00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:02.454
I'm Mario Aldana.
National Director of Airport Police.

435
00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:06.833
First of all. I want to apologize
for the shitty moment you went through.

436
00:27:06.916 --> 00:27:08.960
Don't worry. I also reacted badly.

437
00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:09.961
Yes. you did.

438
00:27:10.628 --> 00:27:14.049
But I suppose you must have
your reasons.

439
00:27:14.507 --> 00:27:16.968
and those reasons are here. right?

440
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.096
Do you mind if I open it?

441
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:22.807
Excuse me.

442
00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:25.727
-Pick up.
-No. it's fine.

443
00:27:26.978 --> 00:27:29.773
-Everything's fine.
-I asked if you mind if I open it.

444
00:27:31.024 --> 00:27:32.817
No. I don't mind. Open it.

445
00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:35.236
-Have a seat.
-Yes.

446
00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:42.160
I'm going to need the code.

447
00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:45.288
Two-two-four.

448
00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:47.624
Let's see.

449
00:27:48.375 --> 00:27:49.417
Two. two...

450
00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:51.169
It doesn't work.

451
00:27:53.588 --> 00:27:54.506
It's two. two. four.

452
00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:56.091
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

453
00:27:58.259 --> 00:28:00.470
I enter two. two. four.
but this does not open.

454
00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:02.764
Try two. two. three.

455
00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:05.600
You don't know your own password?

456
00:28:06.101 --> 00:28:08.311
Yes. but I changed it
for security reasons.

457
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.565
It's not either. Funny. isn't it?

458
00:28:13.483 --> 00:28:18.488
But I came prepared
for this inconvenience.

459
00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.283
Let's try this one.

460
00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:23.451
Okay.

461
00:28:24.702 --> 00:28:25.662
No. that's not it.

462
00:28:27.455 --> 00:28:29.582
-Let's try this one.
-All right. let's see.

463
00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:44.806
Can you tell me what you have inside?

464
00:28:45.265 --> 00:28:46.516
You saw it. Clothes.

465
00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:49.477
Yes. but specifically. what clothes?
What color? How many?

466
00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.480
-Well. I don't know.
-You don't know what you have inside?

467
00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:55.525
No. my wife always packs my suitcase.

468
00:28:56.192 --> 00:28:58.903
So. if I call her and ask her.
she won't find it strange?

469
00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:00.363
No. you can call her.

470
00:29:00.447 --> 00:29:03.658
But she's not home because she's flying.
she's a flight attendant.

471
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.870
And when did she pack your suitcase?

472
00:29:07.495 --> 00:29:08.830
Early in the morning.

473
00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:09.831
I see.

474
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.335
You wear medium sizes. Let's see.

475
00:29:16.629 --> 00:29:18.173
Extra-large.

476
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.091
this is too big for you.

477
00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:22.343
-Yeah.
-This looks like my clothes.

478
00:29:23.178 --> 00:29:24.512
And this one?

479
00:29:26.222 --> 00:29:27.682
And this one is small.
It's a bit small for you.

480
00:29:27.765 --> 00:29:29.017
And another one. would you look at that?

481
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.894
-Yeah.
-Do you like tight clothes?

482
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.021
Yeah.

483
00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:35.648
And here's a large one.
Too big for you as well.

484
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.196
Either you change your size
or your wife doesn't know your size.

485
00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:45.867
There's also a third option.

486
00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:49.287
maybe it's not your suitcase.

487
00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:51.539
Tell me something.

488
00:29:52.373 --> 00:29:55.543
are they pressuring you or paying you?
Please clear my doubt.

489
00:29:58.588 --> 00:30:00.381
Look. this can end today.

490
00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:04.302
You can get out.
no matter what they told you.

491
00:30:04.385 --> 00:30:08.056
I'll protect you. but all you have
to do is tell me the truth.

492
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:12.602
SANTA CLARA TAXIS

493
00:30:14.521 --> 00:30:15.438
Pick up.

494
00:30:19.943 --> 00:30:21.569
-Hello?
-Hi. I'm calling to let you know

495
00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:23.821
we are experiencing
a delay with your car.

496
00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:26.407
No. no. no. I didn't order any taxi.
you're mistaken.

497
00:30:28.409 --> 00:30:29.327
Sorry.

498
00:30:30.703 --> 00:30:32.247
Look. the thing is...

499
00:30:33.122 --> 00:30:34.040
Sorry.

500
00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:37.126
-Yes?
-Mario. you are urgently needed

501
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.003
at Gate 5-C. There is a serious problem.

502
00:30:39.087 --> 00:30:41.047
-Yes. but I...
-We need you here now.

503
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:42.632
It's a big problem.

504
00:30:42.715 --> 00:30:43.716
Okay.

505
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.552
-Come here now.
-Okay. I'm coming.

506
00:30:45.635 --> 00:30:46.761
I'll wait for you here.

507
00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:51.182
Excuse me for a second.
I'll be right back.

508
00:31:07.282 --> 00:31:08.199
Come. let's go.

509
00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:10.493
Come on.

510
00:31:15.915 --> 00:31:17.333
Didn't you say the police
wouldn't touch me?

511
00:31:17.417 --> 00:31:19.252
You are outside.
What are you complaining about?

512
00:31:19.335 --> 00:31:21.045
Screw that. That guy knows.

513
00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:23.131
I can't keep doing this.
we have to stop.

514
00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:24.299
What option do you have left?

515
00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:26.050
What happens if you stop. tell me.

516
00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.136
-Tell me.
-I don't know.

517
00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:30.680
I don't want to tell you because
I don't want to feel like an asshole

518
00:31:30.763 --> 00:31:32.056
because if there's one thing
I can't stand.

519
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.266
it's feeling like an asshole.

520
00:31:33.349 --> 00:31:37.437
Now. if you want me to feel
like the biggest asshole

521
00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.938
you've ever seen in your life.

522
00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:40.481
I can do that. but you won't like it.

523
00:31:40.898 --> 00:31:43.443
But wait. what if it happens again?

524
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.237
What if you don't have time to change
my suitcase and that guy comes?

525
00:31:46.321 --> 00:31:47.238
What do I do then?

526
00:31:49.616 --> 00:31:50.992
Come with me. Follow me.

527
00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:56.539
I'll show you something.

528
00:31:56.623 --> 00:31:58.041
This is your good ear. right?

529
00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:01.878
Look. Do you see the girl
at the counter?

530
00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:04.922
She's with us.

531
00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:07.675
The couple sitting over there

532
00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:10.386
is also with us.

533
00:32:12.305 --> 00:32:16.517
Look at the newsstand.
the guy there is with us.

534
00:32:17.268 --> 00:32:19.729
You already know Beltramino.
next to the staircase.

535
00:32:20.647 --> 00:32:22.357
Do you see that agent?

536
00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:24.108
He's with us too.

537
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.278
Do you understand what I'm saying?

538
00:32:28.738 --> 00:32:34.202
There are more of us than of them.
and we will always protect you.

539
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:44.212
Carolina you don't have to worry.
I'm telling you.

540
00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:46.339
the airport police always do this.

541
00:32:46.422 --> 00:32:49.467
They bully you so you're afraid
and don't do something stupid.

542
00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:51.678
but our world has always been like this.

543
00:32:51.761 --> 00:32:53.179
-Like this. how?
-Like this...

544
00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:55.431
I am talking
about drug trafficking. Carolina.

545
00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:58.059
We pilots are always being watched.

546
00:32:58.142 --> 00:32:59.894
And it's good that it's like that.

547
00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:02.939
And just now I was asked
about a colleague

548
00:33:03.022 --> 00:33:04.107
who had a behavior that was a little...

549
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:07.735
Stop. please stop.
Please don't do this to me.

550
00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:09.737
I thought you were going to stop
and tell me the truth.

551
00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:12.073
but it seems like you're not.
Until when do you plan to keep going?

552
00:33:12.156 --> 00:33:14.242
-I don't know what you mean.
-Yes. you do.

553
00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:18.037
I appreciate the tremendous effort
you're making to lie to me.

554
00:33:18.121 --> 00:33:20.957
I imagine you're doing it
to avoid worrying me.

555
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.543
but it's also a way
of underestimating me.

556
00:33:24.085 --> 00:33:25.586
and I cannot appreciate that.

557
00:33:26.462 --> 00:33:28.965
I don't know if I need to clarify.
but I'm not that naive.

558
00:33:29.048 --> 00:33:30.258
And you're into something weird.

559
00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:31.509
and you've been into something weird
for a long time.

560
00:33:31.592 --> 00:33:33.261
Who is that guy you were with?

561
00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:34.721
The one who just did that to you
in the face?

562
00:33:34.804 --> 00:33:37.265
He's the same guy who came to pick
you up at Zamora's retirement party.

563
00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:38.558
and you ran after him.

564
00:33:38.641 --> 00:33:40.560
Who is he? What's going on. Ale?

565
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:42.937
Caro. no. no.

566
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.606
No. look. if you're going to lie.
please keep it to yourself.

567
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.651
I can't take any more lies.
I'm done with your lies.

568
00:33:48.735 --> 00:33:50.903
I need the truth.

569
00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:53.531
You can do it.
it may be hard. but you can.

570
00:33:53.614 --> 00:33:56.743
I'm not angry.
but I need to know what's going on.

571
00:33:56.826 --> 00:33:58.119
What's going on. Ale?

572
00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.418
Come.

573
00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:16.262
Everything's fine.
nothing's happening. it's true.

574
00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:21.768
But I am cooperating
with intelligence services in Ezeiza.

575
00:34:22.601 --> 00:34:25.438
That guy you saw who did
that to me is one of them.

576
00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:28.399
Cooperating. how?

577
00:34:28.815 --> 00:34:31.402
They asked me to take a suitcase
and deliver it in Madrid.

578
00:34:32.195 --> 00:34:34.489
Are you crazy?
What do you mean. a suitcase?

579
00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:36.824
-In exchange for what?
-In exchange for nothing. Caro.

580
00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:40.870
If the intelligence service asks you
to do it. you have to do it.

581
00:34:40.953 --> 00:34:42.163
And that's why you were detained today?

582
00:34:42.246 --> 00:34:44.331
No. the ones who detained me
were the airport police.

583
00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:48.543
who are trying to stop the operations
of the intelligence service.

584
00:34:48.628 --> 00:34:49.712
It is a beef between them.

585
00:34:49.795 --> 00:34:51.547
Yes. but you're in the middle of it.
and you have to stop.

586
00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:54.717
How do I stop. Caroline? How? Tell me.

587
00:34:55.717 --> 00:34:57.178
This is driving me crazy.

588
00:34:57.261 --> 00:35:00.181
The police tell me to cooperate
with them. they'll protect me.

589
00:35:00.264 --> 00:35:03.100
and the services tell me that no one
will take care of me like they will.

590
00:35:03.184 --> 00:35:05.394
and the truth is they're doing it.

591
00:35:05.478 --> 00:35:06.395
I can't believe it.

592
00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:15.029
Ale.

593
00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:16.697
Hello. Fer.

594
00:35:21.077 --> 00:35:22.787
THE BEST ARGENTINEAN MEAT

595
00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:47.395
Did you see the flight plan?

596
00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:50.648
Yes. yes. we have Oscar. Papa. Alpha.

597
00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:54.485
We have an alternate flight
to Madrid from Barcelona.

598
00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:56.153
full of passengers and cargo.

599
00:35:57.238 --> 00:35:58.155
All right.

600
00:36:13.087 --> 00:36:14.005
-How are you?
-Hi.

601
00:36:14.547 --> 00:36:16.132
Captain. one moment. please.

602
00:36:16.966 --> 00:36:17.967
-How are you?
-Fine.

603
00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:21.012
What would happen
if I opened your suitcase now?

604
00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:26.851
What will I find now that your friends
didn't have time to change it?

605
00:36:28.644 --> 00:36:30.271
Open it. I have nothing to hide.

606
00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:35.151
-Are you sure?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

607
00:36:39.322 --> 00:36:40.907
Don't worry. I won't open it.

608
00:36:42.074 --> 00:36:44.827
If you decide not to cooperate.
you are of no use to me.

609
00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:47.997
-Well. can I get on my plane?
-Yes. go ahead. But here.

610
00:36:49.248 --> 00:36:52.710
Do yourself a favor and
find out what you are carrying

611
00:36:52.793 --> 00:36:55.504
and how the people who did
this before you ended up.

612
00:36:56.505 --> 00:36:57.590
And then give me call.

613
00:36:59.425 --> 00:37:00.343
Thank you.

614
00:37:00.843 --> 00:37:01.761
Bye.

615
00:37:21.489 --> 00:37:22.406
So?

616
00:37:23.991 --> 00:37:25.284
Aren't you going to ask me?

617
00:37:26.285 --> 00:37:27.203
About what?

618
00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:29.580
Ale. don't play dumb.

619
00:37:31.123 --> 00:37:32.124
When did you start?

620
00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:38.255
At the beginning of the year. And you?

621
00:37:39.465 --> 00:37:41.050
In August of last year.

622
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.137
Did you think you were the only one?

623
00:37:45.221 --> 00:37:47.723
I really don't know.
Does everyone who has this route do it?

624
00:37:47.807 --> 00:37:49.892
Everyone they can buy. I guess.

625
00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:53.938
I need the money. you know?

626
00:37:54.021 --> 00:37:54.981
What money?

627
00:37:56.524 --> 00:37:57.441
What do you mean?

628
00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.319
The money. The payment.

629
00:38:00.861 --> 00:38:04.198
I asked you to know
how much they paid you.

630
00:38:04.281 --> 00:38:05.533
I want to know
if they're screwing me up.

631
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.618
2000 dollars per trip.

632
00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:08.786
Is that so?

633
00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:11.872
-Is it okay?
-Yes. yes.

634
00:38:12.373 --> 00:38:15.084
-And you?
-The same amount. The same. It's okay.

635
00:38:15.167 --> 00:38:18.629
The divorce sucked me dry
and you know how things are now.

636
00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:21.924
Having that money under my mattress
gives me peace of mind.

637
00:38:22.008 --> 00:38:22.925
Besides.

638
00:38:24.343 --> 00:38:25.511
it's okay.

639
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.180
You forget about it over time.

640
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.267
I can't believe this conversation.

641
00:38:31.726 --> 00:38:33.227
You live it as if it were so natural.

642
00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:35.271
You. who are the biggest wuss I know.

643
00:38:35.354 --> 00:38:39.025
2000 dollars per trip
will cure your fear.

644
00:38:39.108 --> 00:38:43.195
Did they tell you that we're carrying?
And why do they need so many people?

645
00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:45.239
These guys are on top
of everything. Ale.

646
00:38:45.656 --> 00:38:47.033
They're on another level.

647
00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:50.244
The only thing I made clear to them
was that if it was to carry drugs.

648
00:38:50.327 --> 00:38:52.246
don't count on me.
because the last thing I need is

649
00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:53.831
to get caught with drugs in Spain.

650
00:38:53.914 --> 00:38:55.416
They'll leave me with nothing.

651
00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:57.084
They laughed their asses off
and they swore to me

652
00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:58.419
that it wasn't drugs.

653
00:38:58.502 --> 00:38:59.587
And you believed them?

654
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.588
Yes.

655
00:39:07.928 --> 00:39:09.180
Where did you get that?

656
00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:14.060
-Have a good rest. guys.
-See you in two hours. Thank you.

657
00:39:14.143 --> 00:39:15.061
See you.

658
00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:32.661
-Did you lock the door?
-Yes. yes.

659
00:39:32.745 --> 00:39:34.288
You're crazy.

660
00:39:34.371 --> 00:39:36.916
Alejandro. please leave that alone.
don't be stupid.

661
00:39:36.999 --> 00:39:39.126
-I told you it's not drugs.
-Please shut up.

662
00:39:43.339 --> 00:39:44.381
Guys. can I come in?

663
00:39:47.593 --> 00:39:48.511
It's locked.

664
00:39:49.553 --> 00:39:52.556
That's weird. because it was open
before. Can you push it?

665
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.682
No. it's not opening.

666
00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:56.060
Please. they will find out. Stop that.

667
00:39:56.644 --> 00:39:57.853
It won't open. damn it.

668
00:39:58.312 --> 00:39:59.688
Try again.

669
00:40:01.273 --> 00:40:03.150
-Okay.
-Can't you open it for me?

670
00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:07.822
Yes. yes. I'm trying.
It's loosening up. I think.

671
00:40:13.953 --> 00:40:15.162
No. it's not loosening up.

672
00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:20.334
-So?
-We are coming out.

673
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.673
Sorry. my head hurts.
I need to lie down for a bit.

674
00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:26.924
-This is dangerous.
-Yes.

675
00:40:27.007 --> 00:40:28.634
tell the technician
to take a look at it.

676
00:40:28.717 --> 00:40:29.635
Okay.

677
00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:35.766
"Find out how the people who did this
before you ended up."

678
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.685
-That is what he told me.
-He is playing mind games on you.

679
00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:39.353
because that is the only thing
he can do.

680
00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:40.938
Because if he had any power.
he would have used it by now.

681
00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:42.690
He did the same thing to me last year.

682
00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:44.442
He came up to me. he played friend.
he said he wanted to help me.

683
00:40:44.525 --> 00:40:46.777
I ignored him
and he didn't bother me anymore.

684
00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:49.905
There's nothing to lose by finding out.
We're not the first to do this.

685
00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:53.033
We don't know who else.
Except for Novack. we do not know.

686
00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:54.160
Who's Novack?

687
00:40:55.494 --> 00:40:57.872
Novack. They called him the Pole.
He flew Fly Europa.

688
00:40:57.955 --> 00:40:59.456
He was not from our fleet.

689
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.750
-It doesn't ring a bell.
-He died last year.

690
00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:03.544
He flew this route.

691
00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:05.880
He was a quiet guy. but a good person.

692
00:41:06.213 --> 00:41:08.716
He never said anything to me.
but I noticed things.

693
00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:10.050
just like you and me.

694
00:41:10.551 --> 00:41:12.887
The suitcase. the cow sticker.

695
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.139
the tense look when dealing
with airport police.

696
00:41:15.222 --> 00:41:16.891
-Fernando. are you screwing with me?
-Why?

697
00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:19.518
The only guy we know
who did this is dead.

698
00:41:19.602 --> 00:41:21.103
and you think there's nothing
weird about it?

699
00:41:21.187 --> 00:41:22.563
-How did he die?
-Tell me something.

700
00:41:22.646 --> 00:41:25.107
if you're so scared.
why don't you stop doing it?

701
00:41:26.025 --> 00:41:29.028
-It's not that easy.
-But this route is full of pilots.

702
00:41:29.111 --> 00:41:30.905
Anyone would take the money.

703
00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:33.532
Don't you read the newspapers?
There is no money to spare.

704
00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:37.411
And what if Novack wanted to stop.

705
00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:40.039
and they killed him for it?

706
00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:01.518
What are you waiting for. idiot?

707
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.778
No.

708
00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:15.532
No one lives here. let's go.
The house is abandoned.

709
00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:16.951
Yes. it seems.

710
00:42:19.286 --> 00:42:20.204
Come.

711
00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:25.125
Good morning. ma'am.

712
00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:26.252
-Good morning.
-Hello.

713
00:42:26.335 --> 00:42:28.045
-Sorry to bother you.
-Don't worry.

714
00:42:28.128 --> 00:42:30.756
I was ringing the doorbell
of the house across the street.

715
00:42:30.839 --> 00:42:32.466
Do you know the neighbors?

716
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.260
No. I don't know them.

717
00:42:34.343 --> 00:42:36.011
We want to buy a house for my mom.

718
00:42:36.095 --> 00:42:37.096
Yes.

719
00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:39.932
Are you two siblings?

720
00:42:40.015 --> 00:42:40.933
-Yes.
-Yes.

721
00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:43.519
-You don't look like it.
-We have different fathers.

722
00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:45.437
Do you know the owners?

723
00:42:45.521 --> 00:42:46.563
No. the owner died.

724
00:42:48.357 --> 00:42:49.316
-That's a pity.
-Yes.

725
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.819
What happened to him? Not that anything
should have happened to him.

726
00:42:51.902 --> 00:42:53.946
but you know. the way this country is.
one always expects the worst.

727
00:42:54.029 --> 00:42:56.907
Sorry. if the neighborhood is unsafe.
we can't bring my mom here. right?

728
00:42:56.991 --> 00:42:59.994
-Yeah. that's right.
-No. this is a peaceful neighborhood.

729
00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:02.329
but the owner was killed in a robbery.

730
00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:06.500
-My goodness.
-Yes. yes.

731
00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:07.960
That's awful. What happened?

732
00:43:08.043 --> 00:43:12.256
They used to pick him up every day
in a car to take him to work.

733
00:43:13.173 --> 00:43:14.925
It is better if you contact me at night.

734
00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:16.468
One day. I heard three shots.

735
00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:21.598
I looked out the window
and saw a car speeding away.

736
00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:24.268
and the man lying on the sidewalk.

737
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:26.478
That's why I assumed it was a robbery.

738
00:43:26.562 --> 00:43:28.689
Who would fire three shots
for no reason?

739
00:43:28.772 --> 00:43:33.110
Maybe the man resisted.
but this is a nice neighborhood.

740
00:43:33.694 --> 00:43:34.820
How old is your mom?

741
00:43:56.383 --> 00:43:57.426
Yes? What is it?

742
00:43:57.509 --> 00:44:00.095
Well. I decided to come
and meet my friend.

743
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:02.348
Now?

744
00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:03.932
Are you in Ezeiza?

745
00:44:04.016 --> 00:44:06.643
No. he asked me to a place
in the middle of nowhere.

746
00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:07.895
A safe place in theory.

747
00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:09.772
But did you think it through. Alejandro?

748
00:44:09.855 --> 00:44:12.107
You're going to get us all in trouble.

749
00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:13.984
I won't get us into any trouble.
Fernando.

750
00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:15.402
Please calm down.

751
00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:18.113
I am looking for options.
Maybe he can really help us.

752
00:44:18.822 --> 00:44:22.910
I don't need help. what I need is money.

753
00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:25.329
and we're all going to get our pay cut
because of you.

754
00:44:25.412 --> 00:44:26.914
because you got a little scared.

755
00:44:27.456 --> 00:44:30.501
Novack got robbed and shot.

756
00:44:30.584 --> 00:44:32.461
-That happens every day.
-Three shots. Fernando.

757
00:44:32.544 --> 00:44:33.921
Three. I...

758
00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:35.464
He just arrived.

759
00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:38.801
If I don't call you tonight.
I'll see you tomorrow at Ezeiza.

760
00:44:49.645 --> 00:44:52.231
-I didn't know I could bring someone.
-You couldn't.

761
00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:57.277
Rita Tirabosco.
Lomas de Zamora Federal Prosecutor.

762
00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:58.445
Nice to meet you.

763
00:44:58.529 --> 00:44:59.446
Likewise.

764
00:45:01.156 --> 00:45:02.533
Anyway. the situation
is more or less like this:

765
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.661
on one end.
you have the intelligence services.

766
00:45:06.328 --> 00:45:08.539
on the other. the ministries.

767
00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:11.500
and on the third. the Ezeiza airport.

768
00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:15.129
The intelligence services
have reserved funds.

769
00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:16.672
which they're assigned a budget for.

770
00:45:16.755 --> 00:45:19.633
and they don't have to explain to anyone
how they spend that money.

771
00:45:19.716 --> 00:45:24.012
The other ministries do have
to explain how they spend their money.

772
00:45:24.596 --> 00:45:27.307
but in recent years.
they've come up with a clever trick

773
00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:30.644
where they divert funds
to the intelligence services

774
00:45:30.727 --> 00:45:32.312
as reserved funds.

775
00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:37.151
and then they get the money back
in cash. keeping the change.

776
00:45:37.234 --> 00:45:38.402
Do you follow me so far?

777
00:45:38.485 --> 00:45:39.611
I think so.

778
00:45:39.695 --> 00:45:42.156
When the money circulates
between these two ends.

779
00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:43.657
there's not much I can do.

780
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:48.245
But when Ezeiza intervenes
and takes the money out of the country.

781
00:45:48.328 --> 00:45:51.415
then I can intervene.
because that's currency smuggling.

782
00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:58.922
Look here.
This is Atilio Segovia. aka Saavedra.

783
00:45:59.465 --> 00:46:01.717
He is the head of the Ezeiza group.

784
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.012
which is the intelligence
service's base at the airport.

785
00:46:05.762 --> 00:46:09.099
This guy manages everything.
buying officials for peanuts.

786
00:46:09.558 --> 00:46:10.684
And pilots.

787
00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:11.977
Theoretically.

788
00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:13.228
Theoretically. of course.

789
00:46:13.645 --> 00:46:14.855
You opened the suitcase.

790
00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:21.236
If I had carried a suitcase. yes.
theoretically I could have opened it.

791
00:46:21.695 --> 00:46:23.030
Then you know we are right.

792
00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:28.327
Look. if I hypothetically decided
to declare. what do I gain from it?

793
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:30.579
Well. first of all.
you would avoid prison.

794
00:46:30.662 --> 00:46:33.665
because if I wanted to.
I could accuse you as an accomplice

795
00:46:33.749 --> 00:46:36.084
and leave you to sort it out
with your lawyer.

796
00:46:36.168 --> 00:46:38.295
It's not in our interest to have you
testify as a suspect.

797
00:46:38.378 --> 00:46:41.048
because as a suspect.
you're not obliged to tell the truth.

798
00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:42.299
and you're not even obliged to testify.

799
00:46:42.799 --> 00:46:46.720
It's more convenient for the case
to proceed if you testify as a witness.

800
00:46:46.803 --> 00:46:51.058
You never opened the suitcase.
you don't know what was in it.

801
00:46:52.893 --> 00:46:53.936
But I opened it.

802
00:46:54.019 --> 00:46:55.562
Theoretically.

803
00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:58.732
It's simple. Alejandro:
if you opened it. you're an accomplice.

804
00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:00.526
If you didn't. you're a witness.

805
00:47:02.194 --> 00:47:03.320
Which one do you prefer?

806
00:47:20.045 --> 00:47:21.046
-Get out of the car. Come on.
-Okay. okay.

807
00:47:21.129 --> 00:47:23.006
-Don't move.
-All right. all right. Calm down.

808
00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:24.258
-Come on.
-Come on. walk.

809
00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:25.759
Shut your mouth and walk.

810
00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:27.761
Walk. I said walk.

811
00:47:27.844 --> 00:47:29.846
Put this on and get in. Come on.

812
00:47:37.646 --> 00:47:39.773
Damn it. he's not answering.

813
00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:41.942
Relax. I'm sure everything's fine.

814
00:47:42.317 --> 00:47:45.529
His phone must've died.
you know how Alejandro is.

815
00:47:45.612 --> 00:47:47.573
He's always late. doesn't care.

816
00:47:47.656 --> 00:47:48.991
He must be hanging out with a friend.

817
00:47:49.074 --> 00:47:52.244
Fernando. there's no need to lie to me.
I know what you're doing.

818
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:54.788
I don't know what you're talking about.

819
00:47:54.871 --> 00:47:56.415
Don't play dumb. I know everything.

820
00:47:56.498 --> 00:47:58.375
I know they're forcing you
to take suitcases.

821
00:47:58.458 --> 00:48:00.294
I know Alejandro went to meet
with the cop

822
00:48:00.377 --> 00:48:01.587
because he wants to stop everything.

823
00:48:02.087 --> 00:48:04.965
Who are they forcing?
No one's forcing me to do anything.

824
00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.049
Then why are you doing it?

825
00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:11.263
For the money. Carolina.
Alejandro gets paid too. or not?

826
00:48:12.055 --> 00:48:15.183
Or maybe not. I don't know.
Did he tell you they are forcing him?

827
00:48:15.517 --> 00:48:16.810
Can you contact them?

828
00:48:17.603 --> 00:48:18.645
Contact who?

829
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.482
Okay. okay. give me a minute.

830
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:30.532
Santa Clara Taxis. good evening.

831
00:48:30.616 --> 00:48:35.996
Yes. hello? I need to speak to someone
about Alejandro. my friend.

832
00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:38.457
because I don't know where he is...
Hello?

833
00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:39.791
-Hello?
-So?

834
00:48:41.168 --> 00:48:43.295
-They hung up.
-Stay here in case Ale returns.

835
00:48:43.378 --> 00:48:45.130
-Where are you going?
-I will report it to the police.

836
00:48:45.213 --> 00:48:47.466
No. no. you can't get the police
involved. What will you say?

837
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:48.467
The truth.

838
00:48:52.304 --> 00:48:53.513
Carolina. come here.

839
00:49:33.095 --> 00:49:34.012
Come with me.

840
00:49:39.101 --> 00:49:41.478
Wait. please wait.
What are you going to do to me?

841
00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.980
What are we going to do to you?
I don't know. you tell me.

842
00:49:44.064 --> 00:49:45.315
what we should do to you?

843
00:49:45.399 --> 00:49:47.567
I swear I didn't say anything.

844
00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:49.903
Alejandro. do you know
what annoys me the most?

845
00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:53.907
We didn't report you
for being unfit to fly.

846
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:56.576
We helped you to continue
with your career. We protected you.

847
00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.745
We got the police off your back.
yes or no?

848
00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:59.830
-Yes...
-Yes.

849
00:49:59.913 --> 00:50:02.249
And you ask me.
"What are you going to do to me"?

850
00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:06.586
What do you think we are. criminals?
Why do you disrespect me like this?

851
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.506
-No. no. no.
-Yes. you are disrespecting me.

852
00:50:11.133 --> 00:50:12.259
What's wrong with you?

853
00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:14.136
Why are you so nervous?
What did he tell you?

854
00:50:14.219 --> 00:50:16.596
-Who?
-You know who. the fat moron.

855
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.349
-What did he tell you?
-He wants me to cooperate with him.

856
00:50:19.433 --> 00:50:21.268
to testify against you guys.

857
00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:24.604
I already know that. but why did you
want to meet with him yesterday?

858
00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:29.443
-No. it's not that I wanted to.
-Look.

859
00:50:30.986 --> 00:50:34.072
I shouldn't have to tell you
this because you don't deserve it.

860
00:50:34.156 --> 00:50:35.991
but something is about to change.

861
00:50:36.074 --> 00:50:39.369
It won't be long before all of this
is over for good. and as I promised you.

862
00:50:39.453 --> 00:50:42.748
you'll be able to continue
your life as if we had never met.

863
00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:46.460
Now. if you insist on talking
to that imbecile.

864
00:50:46.918 --> 00:50:49.129
and you tell anyone
what you've been doing.

865
00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:50.881
our deal. what we talked about...

866
00:50:52.048 --> 00:50:53.383
We'll have to respond.

867
00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:56.803
-Is that clear?
-Yes.

868
00:51:00.098 --> 00:51:01.099
The battery's dead.

869
00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:02.684
Get out of here.

870
00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:19.159
Caro!

871
00:51:20.202 --> 00:51:21.119
Caro!

872
00:51:22.287 --> 00:51:23.205
Caro!

873
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.587
I'm here. I'm here now. my love.

874
00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:31.588
I'm here.

875
00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:33.423
They kidnapped me.

876
00:51:34.132 --> 00:51:36.343
They found out
that I went to talk to Aldana.

877
00:51:37.719 --> 00:51:39.471
-They threatened me.
-Is that so?

878
00:51:42.307 --> 00:51:43.391
What's wrong. Carolina?

879
00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:45.852
What's wrong?

880
00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:50.690
You ask me what's wrong?

881
00:51:52.317 --> 00:51:54.528
How do you have the nerve
to keep lying to me like this?

882
00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:55.654
Aren't you ashamed?

883
00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:58.198
What are you saying? What's wrong?

884
00:51:58.281 --> 00:51:59.199
What's wrong?

885
00:52:02.869 --> 00:52:03.870
This.

886
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.920
At least now I understand
why you did it.

887
00:53:06.266 --> 00:53:07.601
You idiot. where the hell were you?

888
00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:09.394
How much did they pay you.
you piece of shit?

889
00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.980
How much did they pay you to betray me?

890
00:53:12.063 --> 00:53:13.315
Are you out of your mind?

891
00:53:13.398 --> 00:53:16.401
You have known me for 40 years.
Fernando. 40.

892
00:53:16.943 --> 00:53:18.612
I welcomed you into my home
when you got divorced.

893
00:53:18.987 --> 00:53:21.448
-What did you do to me?
-But what are you saying?

894
00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:23.783
That son of a bitch. Aldana.
he filled your head with...

895
00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:25.327
Why did you do this to me?

896
00:53:25.827 --> 00:53:27.746
Only you knew I was going to meet him.

897
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:30.248
-What are you talking about?
-You son of a bitch.

898
00:53:30.582 --> 00:53:32.125
Alejandro. Ale!

899
00:53:40.467 --> 00:53:41.718
Shall we grab something to eat
afterwards?

900
00:53:41.801 --> 00:53:43.303
-Yes. but then we go out?
-Yes. but...

901
00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.387
Good morning.

902
00:53:44.471 --> 00:53:45.972
There he is. Ask him.

903
00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:48.475
Alejandro. now that you are back.

904
00:53:49.017 --> 00:53:50.644
what do you think about having
a party tonight?

905
00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:51.937
A New Year's party.

906
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:54.898
Food. drinks. the whole deal.
No family. no problems.

907
00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:57.233
A night out in Madrid. What do you say?

908
00:53:57.317 --> 00:53:59.069
Thank you. but I'm not in the mood.

909
00:53:59.861 --> 00:54:00.779
But. Ale...

910
00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:03.949
What's wrong with him?

911
00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:34.938
The phone you are trying
to reach is turned off.

912
00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:53.790
Ladies and gentlemen. for your safety...

913
00:54:53.873 --> 00:54:54.791
Hey!

914
00:54:56.584 --> 00:54:57.544
What's with that guy?

915
00:54:59.045 --> 00:55:00.463
What happened? Did you forget?

916
00:55:01.673 --> 00:55:02.590
Do you know him?

917
00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:04.801
Get in the car. I'll be right back.

918
00:55:04.884 --> 00:55:05.802
What?

919
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:08.888
-I was over there.
-Yeah.

920
00:55:09.305 --> 00:55:11.349
-What are you doing. Petrossián?
-Didn't they tell you?

921
00:55:11.433 --> 00:55:13.059
-About what?
-I did not bring anything.

922
00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:15.228
-I thought you knew.
-Knew what?

923
00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:18.064
I don't know.
that's what Saavedra told me.

924
00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:20.275
He told me that things
were going to change.

925
00:55:20.358 --> 00:55:21.609
Don't bust my balls. asshole.
I'm not in the mood.

926
00:55:21.693 --> 00:55:23.194
No. I have nothing. look.

927
00:55:23.903 --> 00:55:26.448
It's my clothes.
That's why I wanted to tell you.

928
00:55:26.531 --> 00:55:28.241
It's strange
that they didn't inform you.

929
00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:29.617
-So just relax.
-Come with me.

930
00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:31.077
-Where to?
-It's okay. come with me.

931
00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:32.412
-No.
-Come with me.

932
00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:33.413
Come with me.

933
00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:35.915
-Ale. Alejandro. come here.
-Talk to you later.

934
00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:39.085
No. no. no. let's talk now. Come here.
Don't go away. Come here.

935
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:41.337
What happened?

936
00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:42.756
I'll tell you later.

937
00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:51.431
Saavedra. listen. why did I have
to learn from that asshole

938
00:55:51.514 --> 00:55:52.474
that things have changed?

939
00:55:52.557 --> 00:55:55.268
-What asshole?
-Petrossián. my pilot.

940
00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:57.228
-What?
-It wouldn't have cost anything

941
00:55:57.312 --> 00:55:58.646
to make a phone call
and not make me look like an idiot.

942
00:55:59.355 --> 00:56:01.107
Hold on. what changes
are you talking about?

943
00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:02.400
You didn't send anything.

944
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:04.110
Are you kidding me?

945
00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:06.488
No. asshole. I'm telling you.
you didn't send anything.

946
00:56:06.571 --> 00:56:08.239
Don't call me an asshole.
Get your act together.

947
00:56:08.323 --> 00:56:09.324
Where's the money?

948
00:56:10.366 --> 00:56:11.785
I don't know.
that's why I'm telling you.

949
00:56:11.868 --> 00:56:13.286
We sent the usual from here.

950
00:56:13.369 --> 00:56:16.206
The guy didn't come to the bathroom.
I went out to look for him. found him.

951
00:56:16.289 --> 00:56:18.666
took his suitcase.
opened it and it was full of clothes.

952
00:56:19.292 --> 00:56:20.585
The money has to be there.

953
00:56:20.668 --> 00:56:22.128
It's your responsibility.

954
00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:25.048
Go get him at the hotel
and do what you have to do.

955
00:56:25.465 --> 00:56:27.092
He always stays in the same place.

956
00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:29.052
Solve it. is that clear?

957
00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:31.554
Okay. okay.

958
00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:56.704
So. tell me. what happened?

959
00:56:57.205 --> 00:56:58.498
Nothing happened. calm down.
Nothing happened.

960
00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:00.250
What do you mean. nothing happened?
Don't be stupid. Alejandro.

961
00:57:00.333 --> 00:57:01.251
Who was that guy?

962
00:57:02.001 --> 00:57:04.170
He's Carolina's cousin. he lives here.

963
00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:06.214
He's a drug addict
who always asks me for money.

964
00:57:06.297 --> 00:57:08.341
Today. I cut him off and he went crazy.

965
00:57:08.424 --> 00:57:09.717
But you gave him your suitcase.

966
00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:13.179
What? It only had clothes.

967
00:57:13.972 --> 00:57:15.431
What are you doing? Where are you going?

968
00:57:16.015 --> 00:57:18.184
I have something to do.
I'll be back in a bit.

969
00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:13.698
The requested cellphone is turned off.

970
00:58:24.417 --> 00:58:25.835
Hotel lobby. Good afternoon.

971
00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:27.754
Can you please change my room?

972
00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:29.339
Is there a problem
with the one we gave you?

973
00:58:29.422 --> 00:58:33.092
Yes. the door. It looks like a toy door.
You can kick it open.

974
00:58:33.551 --> 00:58:36.930
Can I have one with a double lock
or a stronger lock?

975
00:58:37.013 --> 00:58:40.099
Sir. all our rooms
are practically identical.

976
00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:41.142
We can...

977
00:58:41.226 --> 00:58:42.852
Son of a bitch. Goddammit.

978
00:58:51.945 --> 00:58:53.363
For God's sake.

979
00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:05.291
Four. three. two. one. zero!

980
00:59:58.428 --> 00:59:59.345
-Good bye.
-Bye.

981
01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.514
-Good bye.
-Thank you very much.

982
01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:26.265
Saavedra?

983
01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:30.269
Saavedra?

984
01:01:36.442 --> 01:01:37.360
Saavedra?

985
01:01:39.278 --> 01:01:40.780
Saavedra. it's me. Alejandro.

986
01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:44.784
Hello?

987
01:01:48.579 --> 01:01:50.623
Listen carefully because I don't like
to repeat myself.

988
01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:54.627
You're going to keep
your mouth shut and come with me.

989
01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:57.422
And you'll only speak
when I tell you to.

990
01:02:00.007 --> 01:02:03.136
And you're going to tell me
what the hell you did with the money.

991
01:02:04.011 --> 01:02:06.597
and if you thought
you could make a fool out of me.

992
01:02:07.014 --> 01:02:07.932
Is that clear?

993
01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:10.143
Yes. but please. calm down.

994
01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:11.978
What part of "keep your mouth shut"
did you not understand?

995
01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:15.857
You have to listen to me. please.

996
01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:19.902
They want to screw me.

997
01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:23.239
but they also want to screw you.

998
01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:28.536
If anyone has the money. it is Saavedra.

999
01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:34.167
I have nothing to do with it.
Do you understand?

1000
01:02:38.337 --> 01:02:39.255
Yeah?

1001
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.592
Then why did you run away?

1002
01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:46.888
Come on. come here. Slowly.

1003
01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.431
-Wait...
-Come here!

1004
01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.641
Okay. Take it easy. I'm going.

1005
01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:54.854
but it's important that you hear this.

1006
01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:58.274
Okay. calm down. I'm going.

1007
01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.075
Please calm down.

1008
01:03:09.994 --> 01:03:10.912
I'm here.

1009
01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:13.789
Thank God. Saavedra.

1010
01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.250
Son of a bitch!

1011
01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:52.745
Help!

1012
01:03:54.705 --> 01:03:57.250
Aldana! Aldana! Aldana! Aldana!

1013
01:03:58.334 --> 01:03:59.877
There he is.

1014
01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:18.479
He is going to get away. Aldana.

1015
01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:19.605
-He is going to get away.
-Please calm down.

1016
01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:22.942
He is going to get away.
He almost killed me.

1017
01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:25.611
Calm down. Carlino. close
all entrances and exits.

1018
01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:28.656
Have them close...
I'm ordering this. Carlino!

1019
01:04:37.456 --> 01:04:38.749
What seems to be the problem. officer?

1020
01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:40.251
Please lower the glass.

1021
01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:41.586
What's the problem?

1022
01:04:44.255 --> 01:04:46.132
-Good evening. sir.
-Good evening. officer.

1023
01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:47.758
Do you need my papers?

1024
01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:49.635
I'm going to ask you to step out
of the car. please.

1025
01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:50.886
But why? Is there a problem?

1026
01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:52.888
Step out of the car slowly. please.

1027
01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:58.477
I think you're making a mistake.

1028
01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:00.563
Please don't make my night harder.

1029
01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:04.817
Okay. all right. Calm down. calm down.
You're making a mistake.

1030
01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:08.487
-Do you have something?
-I don't have anything. asshole.

1031
01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:11.157
I'm going to show you some pictures now.

1032
01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.326
let's see if you recognize
any of these men.

1033
01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:14.827
Do you recognize him?

1034
01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:21.751
How about him?

1035
01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:25.796
And him?

1036
01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:31.844
Him?

1037
01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:37.266
Police. Freeze!

1038
01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:38.851
-Stand still and put your hands up.
-Calm down. calm down.

1039
01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:40.311
Face the car and don't move.

1040
01:05:40.394 --> 01:05:41.979
Calm down. guys.

1041
01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:43.898
What is this?

1042
01:05:48.152 --> 01:05:49.070
Him.

1043
01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:03.959
-Beltramino.
-Yes?

1044
01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:04.960
Please stop.

1045
01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:08.255
What's wrong? You are making a mistake.

1046
01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:10.007
You don't know what you are doing.

1047
01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:29.485
SEVEN MONTHS LATER

1048
01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.097
Good morning. Everything in order?

1049
01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.307
Good morning. madam Prosecutor.
Everything is in order.

1050
01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:03.644
We have some procedures
to do before the trial.

1051
01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:07.857
The most important is to repeat
the Porchietto identification lineup.

1052
01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.358
-Why?
-At the judge's order.

1053
01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:12.445
the defense lawyer found faults
in the procedure

1054
01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:13.529
and annulled the previous one.

1055
01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:15.072
Faults? I don't understand.

1056
01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:19.702
When you ran away with your briefcase.
you hit the guy and hurt his eyelid.

1057
01:07:19.785 --> 01:07:21.704
-What?
-The guys who were selected

1058
01:07:21.787 --> 01:07:25.624
to stand with the suspect in the lineup
did not have a damaged eyelid.

1059
01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:28.586
So. that's not fair for the accused.

1060
01:07:28.669 --> 01:07:30.087
I don't believe it.

1061
01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:31.922
-Excuse me.
-Yes. of course.

1062
01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:32.923
Hello. Yes.

1063
01:07:33.257 --> 01:07:35.259
Don't worry. they're doing this
to delay the process.

1064
01:07:35.342 --> 01:07:37.178
They're desperate because they know
they won't get away with it.

1065
01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:40.639
I'm desperate. Mario.
I've been isolated for seven months.

1066
01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:43.601
I can't talk to anyone.
and nobody came to visit me.

1067
01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:45.770
Even inmates have it better than me.

1068
01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:48.647
I need to see Carolina. Mario.

1069
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.524
Calm down.
We'll arrange a meeting for you.

1070
01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:52.818
-We'll organize it.
-Okay. thanks.

1071
01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.153
What are you doing dressed like that?
It's weird.

1072
01:07:54.653 --> 01:07:56.447
-Didn't I tell you they are desperate?
-Why?

1073
01:07:56.822 --> 01:08:00.326
They asked for my resignation
and made up a cause for smuggling.

1074
01:08:00.826 --> 01:08:02.244
You know how it is
with intelligence friends.

1075
01:08:02.328 --> 01:08:05.998
they can take plastic. scissors. paper.
and make up a case out of it.

1076
01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:08.709
Anyway. once the truth comes out.
the damage is done.

1077
01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:10.836
Those bastards.

1078
01:08:12.129 --> 01:08:13.631
I always wanted to ask you. Mario.

1079
01:08:13.714 --> 01:08:16.091
why Novack
wasn't a protected witness like me?

1080
01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:19.094
To be a protected witness.
you have to report a crime.

1081
01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:20.470
but Novack didn't want to.

1082
01:08:20.554 --> 01:08:24.767
I was trying to convince him
when he got killed.

1083
01:08:25.976 --> 01:08:28.728
I guess they thought
they would stop me too.

1084
01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:30.856
but don't worry. you're safe here.

1085
01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:31.857
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1086
01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:35.528
It's not in their best interest
to kill you.

1087
01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:37.905
You're about to testify in court.

1088
01:08:37.987 --> 01:08:42.283
and killing the person who reported them
would only make things worse.

1089
01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:45.287
They'll try to convince you
to change your statement.

1090
01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:48.499
But they won't be able to.

1091
01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.393
Come here. you son of a bitch.

1092
01:09:09.353 --> 01:09:10.271
No. wait.

1093
01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:20.573
Are you going to shut your big mouth
or do you feel like testifying?

1094
01:09:21.782 --> 01:09:22.782
Are you going to shut up or not?

1095
01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:25.411
Don't shoot.

1096
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:27.371
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

1097
01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.375
Next time I won't forget the bullets.

1098
01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:34.628
Let's go.

1099
01:10:09.746 --> 01:10:10.873
Hi.

1100
01:10:12.124 --> 01:10:13.041
Hi.

1101
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.045
-Excuse me.
-Come on in.

1102
01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:24.637
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1103
01:10:24.719 --> 01:10:25.763
Thank you very much.

1104
01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:28.307
Let me know if you need anything else.

1105
01:10:28.389 --> 01:10:29.475
Okay.

1106
01:10:32.853 --> 01:10:34.228
You have good surveillance. don't you?

1107
01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:36.315
I don't know why
they put a patrol car at my door

1108
01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:38.317
when she's all the police I need.

1109
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.693
It's for your own safety. Caro.

1110
01:10:40.778 --> 01:10:42.529
you never know what these guys
are capable of.

1111
01:10:42.612 --> 01:10:44.323
But I haven't received any threats.

1112
01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:48.452
I think they understand
that it's over between you and me.

1113
01:10:49.161 --> 01:10:50.537
I wouldn't say it's completely over.

1114
01:10:52.706 --> 01:10:55.876
Caro. I asked permission
to come to see you

1115
01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:59.505
because there is something
I want to talk to you about.

1116
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.382
Something I wanted to tell you.

1117
01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:03.675
Well...

1118
01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:08.681
A couple of years ago.
I was diagnosed with hearing loss.

1119
01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:10.516
-What?
-It's nothing.

1120
01:11:11.058 --> 01:11:12.184
But you know how it is.

1121
01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.184
If they find out.

1122
01:11:14.978 --> 01:11:17.815
they'll ground me immediately.

1123
01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.318
-But I talked to my doctor...
-Your lover.

1124
01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:23.445
My doctor. Caro.

1125
01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:25.906
And I convinced her
to let me keep flying.

1126
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:28.282
Passengers are not at risk with me.

1127
01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:30.911
I am close to retirement

1128
01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:34.081
and would like to finish my career
up there and not all abruptly.

1129
01:11:35.082 --> 01:11:38.252
She granted it to me.
signed it and those guys found out.

1130
01:11:39.335 --> 01:11:43.048
And used it to pressure me.
which is why I'm in this mess now.

1131
01:11:46.175 --> 01:11:47.386
So you're an idiot.

1132
01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:51.139
Yes. you're an idiot.

1133
01:11:51.639 --> 01:11:53.726
We haven't been together
for more than six months.

1134
01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:55.269
and now I'm stuck in my sister's house

1135
01:11:55.352 --> 01:11:58.147
with a police car parked outside
because of your stupid decisions.

1136
01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:00.398
I can't go to work. Ale.

1137
01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:03.110
My sister keeps nagging me.
and I feel like an idiot.

1138
01:12:03.193 --> 01:12:05.946
And now you come here
with a smile on your face.

1139
01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:09.241
acting all righteous. telling me
that all of this could have been avoided

1140
01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:10.659
if you had stopped flying?

1141
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:15.664
What do you want?
For me to thank you for being honest?

1142
01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:18.125
It's late. Not late. very late.

1143
01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:20.585
We can't all be applauding you

1144
01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:22.129
while we're paying for your mess.

1145
01:12:22.212 --> 01:12:24.798
Fernando calls me every night.
he's desperate and scared.

1146
01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:26.800
He can't stand on his own.

1147
01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:29.053
and it's logical
after what they did to him.

1148
01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:30.429
What did they do to him?

1149
01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.514
What do you mean.
what did they do to him?

1150
01:12:32.598 --> 01:12:36.393
Right. I forgot. I'm with mister
"I don't give a crap about others."

1151
01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:38.603
What do you mean.
what did they do to him?

1152
01:12:39.563 --> 01:12:40.481
My goodness.

1153
01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:46.987
Those bastards.

1154
01:12:47.946 --> 01:12:50.616
Are you coming in
or are you here to hit me again?

1155
01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:52.451
I'm telling you
because I have something boiling

1156
01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.745
on the stove and I don't want it
to burn.

1157
01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.581
-Was it in here?
-It was at the front door.

1158
01:12:57.664 --> 01:13:01.543
Three very efficient state employees
came to my home.

1159
01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:02.585
I can't complain.

1160
01:13:04.254 --> 01:13:05.464
Come. have a seat.

1161
01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:06.632
-What is it?
-Come. come.

1162
01:13:11.719 --> 01:13:12.638
Give me your phone.

1163
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:15.014
No. I'm not allowed
to have a cellphone. Why?

1164
01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:16.016
Try to remember.

1165
01:13:16.391 --> 01:13:18.811
When these guys invited you
to cooperate.

1166
01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:20.478
did they keep your phone?

1167
01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.566
-Her wife called several times.
-Did you answer it?

1168
01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:28.487
That's how they knew
everything you were doing.

1169
01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:30.989
They were listening to us
all the time. you idiot.

1170
01:13:31.698 --> 01:13:34.159
They can hack one of these new
phones in two minutes.

1171
01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.452
Look at the one I have now. Look at it.

1172
01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:38.996
I want to see them try to hack this.
those assholes.

1173
01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:42.000
My God. how embarrassing.

1174
01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:46.338
Forgive me. Fernando. I'm an asshole.

1175
01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:48.382
You're an asshole. but I forgive you.

1176
01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:52.177
Listen. come with me. I have security.

1177
01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.387
I don't need it.

1178
01:13:53.469 --> 01:13:55.305
What do you mean you don't need it?
They almost killed you. Fernando.

1179
01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:58.642
They're not going to beat me up again.
I already took care of it.

1180
01:13:58.725 --> 01:13:59.934
I'm not going to testify.

1181
01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:03.772
No. you can't refuse now.

1182
01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.984
I'm tired of living in fear.

1183
01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:10.862
Besides. I'm not a witness.
I'm a suspect.

1184
01:14:11.237 --> 01:14:13.448
-They can't force me to testify.
-Listen to me.

1185
01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:16.368
The prosecutor allowed me to come
because she wants me to tell you

1186
01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:19.538
specifically that if you cooperate.
she'll protect you.

1187
01:14:20.121 --> 01:14:22.207
She doesn't want to go after you.
She wants to go after the big guys.

1188
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.628
Tell the prosecutor
that the big guys explained to me

1189
01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:28.088
very well how things work.

1190
01:14:30.090 --> 01:14:31.008
How about you?

1191
01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.302
Are you going to testify? Are you sure?

1192
01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:36.805
If you don't say anything.
the trial will fall apart.

1193
01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:39.641
Have you thought about what comes next?

1194
01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:41.977
You sit down. testify. tell the truth.

1195
01:14:42.059 --> 01:14:44.646
they'll put these guys in jail
and what happens next?

1196
01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:46.690
Do you think they will leave you alone?

1197
01:14:46.773 --> 01:14:50.568
They never caught Saavedra.
that son of a bitch.

1198
01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:53.447
We don't even know
if they're looking for him.

1199
01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:56.407
No. Fernando. you are crazy.
I can't deny everything now.

1200
01:14:56.491 --> 01:14:57.492
The prosecutor was very clear.

1201
01:14:57.576 --> 01:14:59.577
She told me. "You are either
a witness or an accomplice."

1202
01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:01.914
If I don't cooperate.
they'll throw me in jail.

1203
01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.249
I'm not playing. I'm going to testify.

1204
01:15:16.469 --> 01:15:20.307
Listen to me. calm down.
Don't be nervous. It's routine.

1205
01:15:20.389 --> 01:15:22.267
You'll identify the guy and that's it.

1206
01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.102
You've told me 20 times
not to get nervous and.

1207
01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.897
to be honest with you.
that makes me even more nervous.

1208
01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:30.108
Hello. ma'am.
Hello. Alejandro. Please take a seat.

1209
01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:32.318
-I'll see how much time we have.
-Thanks. Let's go.

1210
01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:38.075
-Hello. Caro. can you talk?
-Yes. Fer. What is it?

1211
01:15:38.157 --> 01:15:40.619
It's Alejandro.
He's about to screw up his life.

1212
01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:42.955
-We have to stop him.
-What did he do now?

1213
01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.206
Fortunately. nothing yet.

1214
01:15:44.581 --> 01:15:48.043
But he's determined to testify
against some very dangerous guys.

1215
01:15:48.126 --> 01:15:50.128
He doesn't understand
they're going to fuck him up.

1216
01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:53.173
He came to my house. I tried to talk him
out of it. but his mind is made up.

1217
01:15:53.257 --> 01:15:55.008
And I feel that if things keep
going like this.

1218
01:15:55.092 --> 01:15:56.969
the trial won't even happen.
they'll kill him before.

1219
01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:58.637
and they'll kill me too.

1220
01:15:58.719 --> 01:16:02.307
They'll kill us all.
You have to help me convince him.

1221
01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.017
But he is a protected witness.

1222
01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:06.144
He has 200 cops watching him.

1223
01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:07.563
He has only two guards. Caro.

1224
01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:09.690
They are not going to stop
until they kill him.

1225
01:16:09.773 --> 01:16:11.817
You have to help me
convince him not to testify.

1226
01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.026
But I can't call him.

1227
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:14.443
They don't let him have a cellphone.

1228
01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:19.032
Listen to me. I'm going to meet him
at the lawyer's office in a bit.

1229
01:16:19.532 --> 01:16:21.743
He's with her now. in court.
then they'll come here.

1230
01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:24.496
Why don't you come too?
We can talk about it together.

1231
01:16:24.579 --> 01:16:25.789
I'm worried about him
deciding this alone.

1232
01:16:25.871 --> 01:16:26.790
What time?

1233
01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:29.166
In about an hour. Can you make it?

1234
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.713
Alright. I'm heading there.

1235
01:16:33.171 --> 01:16:34.130
Thanks.

1236
01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:45.976
There are two delayed hearings.
so it's going to take a while.

1237
01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.442
STOP TAKING AWAY OUR LABOR RIGHTS

1238
01:16:53.525 --> 01:16:55.943
POLICE

1239
01:17:14.671 --> 01:17:15.672
Fer!

1240
01:17:15.755 --> 01:17:16.757
Fer. over here.

1241
01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:19.800
Look at you. what a mess.

1242
01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:21.553
Don't worry. I'm fine.

1243
01:17:21.636 --> 01:17:23.055
This is a mess. What's going on?

1244
01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:25.223
-I didn't know this was going on.
-Am I late?

1245
01:17:26.058 --> 01:17:27.309
Move around the corner.

1246
01:17:31.646 --> 01:17:33.898
Careful. Mario. Around the corner.
Pick them up in the corner.

1247
01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:40.155
Come here. Calm down. Come here.

1248
01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:43.032
What is it? What is it?

1249
01:17:46.077 --> 01:17:47.079
Fer?

1250
01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:48.163
What are you doing?

1251
01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:50.999
What's wrong?

1252
01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:52.834
Fernando?

1253
01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:56.755
Forgive me.

1254
01:17:57.464 --> 01:17:58.757
For what?

1255
01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.300
-Carolina?
-Yes?

1256
01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:44.969
Please. come in.

1257
01:18:45.594 --> 01:18:46.513
Hi. yes?

1258
01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:48.974
What?

1259
01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:52.978
Okay. go. No. go with them.

1260
01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:56.898
It doesn't matter. go with them.
and let me know when you arrive. okay?

1261
01:18:59.359 --> 01:19:00.318
Did something happen?

1262
01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:05.740
So? Did they tell you anything?

1263
01:19:06.616 --> 01:19:07.701
She's still in a coma.

1264
01:19:08.743 --> 01:19:10.077
she lost a lot of blood.

1265
01:19:12.746 --> 01:19:15.834
Leave. leave. They're going
to kill you here. I'll stay.

1266
01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.700
Could you at least see her?

1267
01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:50.660
No.

1268
01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:53.705
They keep me updated.

1269
01:19:55.957 --> 01:19:57.918
She is still in a coma. the poor thing.

1270
01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:00.962
But at least she's stable.

1271
01:20:03.673 --> 01:20:05.008
I'll leave your tea here.

1272
01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:16.436
You know what? I've been thinking.

1273
01:20:18.688 --> 01:20:20.565
Carolina's guard

1274
01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:25.320
said that she asked to go
to my lawyer's office.

1275
01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:27.614
I didn't summon her

1276
01:20:28.907 --> 01:20:30.407
and neither did my lawyer.

1277
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.827
What was she doing there. Fer?

1278
01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.999
It's strange. I don't know.

1279
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:47.509
That's why I'm here.

1280
01:20:50.844 --> 01:20:52.305
Why? What's wrong?

1281
01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:57.602
I need your cellphone.

1282
01:20:59.353 --> 01:21:00.564
My cellphone? Why?

1283
01:21:00.647 --> 01:21:03.023
I am cut off. I need to make a call.

1284
01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:05.235
Who are you going to call?

1285
01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:10.156
I'm going to finish with all of this.
Fer.

1286
01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.157
It's over.

1287
01:21:13.451 --> 01:21:14.577
Be careful. Alejandro.

1288
01:21:19.332 --> 01:21:21.334
SANTA CLARA TAXIS

1289
01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:39.019
Is it you?

1290
01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:42.063
I was waiting for you to call.

1291
01:21:44.773 --> 01:21:46.526
You son of a bitch.

1292
01:21:49.862 --> 01:21:53.700
I know it was you.
you're a piece of shit.

1293
01:21:53.782 --> 01:21:55.410
Alejandro. I'm not going to act offended

1294
01:21:55.493 --> 01:21:57.495
because I understand
the situation you're in.

1295
01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:59.039
but I swear it wasn't me.

1296
01:21:59.121 --> 01:22:00.373
It was somewhere from the house.

1297
01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:02.208
Someone from the house? Really?

1298
01:22:02.791 --> 01:22:04.502
It was you. you son of a bitch.

1299
01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:06.921
It wasn't me.

1300
01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:09.382
These people are getting nervous
and I'm telling you

1301
01:22:09.466 --> 01:22:10.592
because I'm scared too.

1302
01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:13.469
Do you think everything that happened
was good for my career?

1303
01:22:13.969 --> 01:22:15.722
If I don't fix this.
it will complicate everything.

1304
01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:16.723
Really?

1305
01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:18.350
Well.

1306
01:22:19.517 --> 01:22:20.934
I also want to fix this.

1307
01:22:22.603 --> 01:22:23.605
I'm listening.

1308
01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:25.982
One million.

1309
01:22:26.566 --> 01:22:27.484
One million pesos?

1310
01:22:28.318 --> 01:22:29.235
One million dollars.

1311
01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:33.490
What? You're going to tell me
you can't get it?

1312
01:22:33.907 --> 01:22:37.369
Obviously. there's some availability.
but I'm not a bank either.

1313
01:22:37.994 --> 01:22:40.664
Nevertheless. if you need that
to feel calm.

1314
01:22:40.746 --> 01:22:42.332
don't worry. I'll get it for you.

1315
01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:45.794
A million dollars for you
to deny everything in court

1316
01:22:45.877 --> 01:22:48.380
and move on with your life
as if nothing happened.

1317
01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:51.925
Well. everything happened.
but it won't continue to happen.

1318
01:22:52.008 --> 01:22:53.050
Where should we meet?

1319
01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:56.513
I'm not stupid. Saavedra.

1320
01:22:57.472 --> 01:23:00.308
I know you want to get rid of me.
I need guarantees.

1321
01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:02.434
You still don't trust me.
and I understand that.

1322
01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:06.064
But if you want that money.
I have to deliver it to you personally.

1323
01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:10.402
That's fine. but it's going
to be a public place.

1324
01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:12.445
Okay.

1325
01:23:13.987 --> 01:23:15.407
But I'll choose the location.

1326
01:23:17.032 --> 01:23:17.992
When should we meet?

1327
01:23:18.743 --> 01:23:19.702
I will call you.

1328
01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:21.746
Give me a hint... Hello?

1329
01:23:32.048 --> 01:23:36.344
Okay. calm down. take your time.

1330
01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:39.264
If necessary. I can get them
to come a little closer.

1331
01:23:39.347 --> 01:23:40.432
There is no rush.

1332
01:24:19.219 --> 01:24:20.722
No. he's not there.

1333
01:24:26.478 --> 01:24:28.271
There is no need to rush the answer.

1334
01:24:29.063 --> 01:24:33.109
Pay attention to details.
Try to connect with your memory.

1335
01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:36.654
Yes. I did that. but he's not there.

1336
01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:39.824
Alejandro. please.

1337
01:24:39.907 --> 01:24:42.494
Ma'am. he said he's not there.
Please don't insist.

1338
01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:46.831
The witness is suffering
a very traumatic situation.

1339
01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:49.834
We'll go outside for a minute
to get some fresh air

1340
01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:52.337
and reorganize our ideas. that's all.

1341
01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:58.635
Alejandro.
Alejandro. what are you doing?

1342
01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:03.139
Well. it's been a while.
Rita. his face is fading from my memory.

1343
01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:06.226
The guy is in there. and you know it.
You have not forgotten his face.

1344
01:25:06.309 --> 01:25:07.434
I'm not an idiot.

1345
01:25:07.519 --> 01:25:08.603
What are you doing?

1346
01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:12.523
You're scared. it's okay.

1347
01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:15.568
I understand. I'd be the same way
in your position

1348
01:25:15.652 --> 01:25:17.237
after everything they did to you.

1349
01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:19.239
That's what they do.

1350
01:25:19.823 --> 01:25:23.034
but this is the only way
we have to stop them.

1351
01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:24.911
I don't see them being stopped.

1352
01:25:25.745 --> 01:25:27.539
Your fear will have consequences.

1353
01:25:28.623 --> 01:25:31.918
If you don't identify this guy.
they'll let him go.

1354
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:34.712
I can't help you anymore. Rita.

1355
01:25:36.255 --> 01:25:38.258
What do you mean? You won't testify?

1356
01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:41.302
No.

1357
01:25:42.344 --> 01:25:44.389
Your cooperation
with the prosecutor's office

1358
01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:47.308
is the only thing protecting you
at this moment.

1359
01:25:47.892 --> 01:25:49.269
I'm not threatening you.

1360
01:25:49.352 --> 01:25:52.355
but if you don't testify.
I'll charge you.

1361
01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:57.568
take away custody.
and you'll be more vulnerable than ever.

1362
01:25:58.486 --> 01:25:59.904
Do what you have to do.

1363
01:26:10.957 --> 01:26:12.041
-Alejandro.
-Yes?

1364
01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:13.251
Here are your things.

1365
01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:15.044
-Thanks.
-Good luck. man.

1366
01:26:30.184 --> 01:26:31.227
Bye.

1367
01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:20.360
Ale. my friend. it's always
a pleasure to hear from you.

1368
01:27:20.693 --> 01:27:22.862
Hello. Do you have the money?

1369
01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:25.198
Fortunately for you. yes.

1370
01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:30.662
Tomorrow at midnight.
under the Monumental Tower in Retiro.

1371
01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.998
In Retiro with a million dollars?

1372
01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:34.999
That's brave.

1373
01:27:35.708 --> 01:27:37.210
Don't you prefer a safer place?

1374
01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:39.170
No. there it is fine.

1375
01:27:40.463 --> 01:27:42.005
At 12 o'clock there. then.

1376
01:28:33.933 --> 01:28:36.059
-Hello.
-Hello. Mario. Alejandro speaking.

1377
01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:37.728
-How are you. Alejandro?
-Fine.

1378
01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.731
-Listen. I don't have time.
-Tell me.

1379
01:28:39.814 --> 01:28:42.900
I am at the Sheraton Hotel in Retiro.
room 1404.

1380
01:28:43.568 --> 01:28:45.068
I need a favor.

1381
01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:02.587
I don't know what you're thinking.
but you have to stop.

1382
01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:04.088
It's too late for that. Mario.
Did you bring it?

1383
01:29:04.505 --> 01:29:06.716
Yes. but before anything else.
why do you want it?

1384
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:09.761
I trust you. you trust me.
Give it to me.

1385
01:29:14.264 --> 01:29:16.601
Wait. I'll ask you once more.

1386
01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:18.269
are you sure
about what you're going to do?

1387
01:29:19.437 --> 01:29:23.273
No. I'm not. but I have no choice
and I need your help.

1388
01:30:01.228 --> 01:30:03.773
-Where are you?
-Ale. my friend. can you hear me?

1389
01:30:04.398 --> 01:30:07.151
Sorry. I seem to be messing with you.

1390
01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:08.236
How are you?

1391
01:30:08.318 --> 01:30:10.696
-It's time.
-Yes. I'm almost there.

1392
01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.156
Can you see me?

1393
01:30:19.121 --> 01:30:20.206
What is this?

1394
01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.791
It's intelligence. baby.

1395
01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:26.629
Intelligence involves
anticipating events.

1396
01:30:26.712 --> 01:30:28.089
like when you play chess.

1397
01:30:28.464 --> 01:30:30.591
You move thinking
of what the other person is going to do.

1398
01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:33.052
taking into account
what they did before. of course.

1399
01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:36.681
And I want to congratulate you
because tonight

1400
01:30:36.764 --> 01:30:38.099
you did some intelligence.

1401
01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:40.017
Or at least you tried.

1402
01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:42.270
Sometimes it works out.
sometimes it doesn't.

1403
01:30:42.353 --> 01:30:44.021
Where are you. you son of a bitch?

1404
01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:46.773
Now that you're not going
to fly anymore.

1405
01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:48.651
you can switch to my line of work.

1406
01:30:48.734 --> 01:30:50.027
There's always a need for people.

1407
01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:52.071
Don't hide. show yourself.
Where are you?

1408
01:30:52.655 --> 01:30:56.409
Do me a little favor.
signal to your friend to come closer.

1409
01:30:56.492 --> 01:30:58.035
He knows what he has to do.

1410
01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:10.089
There you have what we arranged.
one million dollars.

1411
01:31:10.173 --> 01:31:13.009
Dude. you don't know how I envy you.

1412
01:31:13.092 --> 01:31:14.719
Fernando. what are you doing here?

1413
01:31:17.513 --> 01:31:19.473
Forgive me. Alejandro. I have to do it.

1414
01:31:20.391 --> 01:31:21.642
What do you have to do?

1415
01:31:25.021 --> 01:31:25.938
What are you doing?

1416
01:31:28.523 --> 01:31:29.442
Forgive me.

1417
01:31:30.234 --> 01:31:31.485
What did you do. Fernando?

1418
01:31:32.445 --> 01:31:36.324
Ask him if he is asking for forgiveness
for tonight or the other day.

1419
01:31:37.909 --> 01:31:39.827
It's clear that he didn't like
your wife.

1420
01:31:41.579 --> 01:31:43.581
Giving a poor woman away like that.

1421
01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:47.710
They have me threatened.
they want to kill me.

1422
01:31:47.793 --> 01:31:48.794
Shut up.

1423
01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:50.087
Please believe me.

1424
01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:51.839
Do you believe him or not?

1425
01:31:51.923 --> 01:31:54.925
Where are you. you son of a bitch?

1426
01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:58.596
Yes. I'm a son of a bitch.
but I'm not vengeful.

1427
01:31:58.679 --> 01:32:02.350
Anyone else in my place
would have shot you twice. but not me.

1428
01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:06.312
Despite being in this business.
I still believe in the word of honor.

1429
01:32:07.730 --> 01:32:08.814
That's it. Alejandro.

1430
01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:13.778
take the money
and go back to where you're hiding.

1431
01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:16.447
Count it well. I don't want you
to be short of anything.

1432
01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:18.532
and start planning
the rest of your life.

1433
01:32:18.616 --> 01:32:20.618
I'm asking you. please believe me.

1434
01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:22.286
-Get out of here!
-Please believe me.

1435
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:23.871
Get out of here!

1436
01:32:23.955 --> 01:32:26.123
Get out of here! Get out of here!

1437
01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:27.333
You're doing the right thing.

1438
01:32:27.416 --> 01:32:29.418
you can't be friends
with a guy like that.

1439
01:32:29.877 --> 01:32:32.755
If there's one thing I can't stand.
it's disloyalty.

1440
01:33:32.189 --> 01:33:33.107
Where are you?

1441
01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.693
I'm already in the hotel.

1442
01:33:35.776 --> 01:33:37.361
Okay. I'll wait for you here.

1443
01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:38.362
No.

1444
01:33:38.779 --> 01:33:39.947
No? No what?

1445
01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:41.907
Give me the money.

1446
01:33:41.991 --> 01:33:43.784
I will give it to you. but I don't want
to expose myself any further.

1447
01:33:43.868 --> 01:33:45.036
I don't trust you.

1448
01:33:46.202 --> 01:33:47.955
We made a deal. son of a bitch.

1449
01:33:48.539 --> 01:33:52.209
Relax. Open the nightstand drawer.
there's a room card

1450
01:33:52.835 --> 01:33:55.296
with the number 453.

1451
01:33:55.755 --> 01:33:57.255
I'm leaving the money there for you.

1452
01:34:58.859 --> 01:35:00.945
Police! Freeze! Get down on the ground.

1453
01:35:01.028 --> 01:35:03.239
All right. all right. Calm down.

1454
01:35:03.322 --> 01:35:04.782
Drop the gun.

1455
01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:06.282
I don't have anything else.

1456
01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:07.326
Please stop.

1457
01:35:07.701 --> 01:35:09.286
I don't have anything else.

1458
01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:10.955
That's it. Son of a bitch.

1459
01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:15.626
You're under arrest.

1460
01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:18.921
I'll kill you. you son of a bitch.

1461
01:35:25.177 --> 01:35:28.097
I want both of you
in my office tomorrow.

1462
01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:30.641
I've got the prosecutor on my back.

1463
01:35:31.434 --> 01:35:33.018
Is there something I should know?

1464
01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:34.978
About what?

1465
01:35:35.062 --> 01:35:39.984
I was told we had Saavedra.
and it turns out that I. like an idiot.

1466
01:35:40.067 --> 01:35:43.946
ordered an operation and they killed
the guy right in front of us.

1467
01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:47.907
Did you know Porchietto
was in the hotel?

1468
01:35:54.206 --> 01:35:55.124
Come.

1469
01:36:01.630 --> 01:36:03.382
And how were we supposed to know?

1470
01:36:03.466 --> 01:36:08.888
Come on. give me a break.
Don't be such a killjoy. sister.

1471
01:36:08.971 --> 01:36:10.181
They are bringing him out.

1472
01:36:39.919 --> 01:36:41.295
Saavedra. you son of a bitch!

1473
01:36:42.296 --> 01:36:43.214
No!

1474
01:36:43.964 --> 01:36:45.049
-Fernando!
-No!

1475
01:36:45.132 --> 01:36:46.050
Fernando!

1476
01:36:46.383 --> 01:36:47.300
Let me go!

1477
01:36:47.927 --> 01:36:50.179
Let me go! Let me go!

1478
01:36:50.262 --> 01:36:52.848
Son of a bitch! Let me go!

1479
01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:55.142
Let me go. you bastard!

1480
01:36:55.226 --> 01:36:57.561
-Hands on the truck.
-Son of a bitch!

1481
01:36:58.187 --> 01:37:00.064
Saavedra. you son of a bitch!

1482
01:37:00.814 --> 01:37:02.023
-Turn around.
-Let me go!

1483
01:37:02.107 --> 01:37:03.817
-Turn around.
-Let me go!

1484
01:37:04.818 --> 01:37:06.862
Son of a bitch!

1485
01:37:07.487 --> 01:37:09.782
Saavedra. you're a son of a bitch!

1486
01:37:18.624 --> 01:37:23.379
ONE YEAR LATER

1487
01:37:59.832 --> 01:38:00.749
Hi. Caro.

1488
01:38:01.584 --> 01:38:02.501
How are you?

1489
01:38:05.254 --> 01:38:06.964
I wanted to know how you were doing.

1490
01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:10.968
It's been a while since we talked.
I haven't heard from you.

1491
01:38:12.386 --> 01:38:16.014
If someday you feel like having
a drink or seeing each other...

1492
01:38:17.308 --> 01:38:19.934
I'm very sorry for what I did.
for what happened.

1493
01:38:22.021 --> 01:38:25.107
I screwed up a lot. Caro.
and I never apologized.

1494
01:38:25.858 --> 01:38:29.987
I don't know if there's any way
to make up for the pain I caused you.

1495
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:31.322
but I would like to try.

1496
01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:35.451
Anyway. I'm sending you a big kiss.

1497
01:38:35.909 --> 01:38:37.161
I love you so much. Bye.

1498
01:38:56.013 --> 01:38:57.431
I'm a little worried about you.

1499
01:38:57.848 --> 01:39:01.894
Relax. don't worry. everything's fine.
It's normal that he wants to meet you.

1500
01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:04.730
but this guy. he's a good guy.
a worthy successor.

1501
01:39:04.813 --> 01:39:05.856
I trained him myself.

1502
01:39:06.648 --> 01:39:08.233
What are you doing without a tie?

1503
01:39:08.734 --> 01:39:09.693
What's the problem?

1504
01:39:09.777 --> 01:39:11.779
The director of the airport police...

1505
01:39:11.862 --> 01:39:13.572
I think it's appropriate. don't you?

1506
01:39:14.531 --> 01:39:15.699
-Here you go.
-No.

1507
01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:17.368
But...

1508
01:39:19.119 --> 01:39:20.412
-Put this on.
-Do you think it is necessary?

1509
01:39:20.496 --> 01:39:21.413
Go on.

1510
01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:24.041
-Where are we going. Mario?
-Trust me.

1511
01:39:24.124 --> 01:39:25.041
There he is.

1512
01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:26.960
Bravo. Ale!

1513
01:39:27.044 --> 01:39:28.796
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

1514
01:39:32.174 --> 01:39:33.092
Bravo!

1515
01:39:34.134 --> 01:39:35.052
Bravo!

1516
01:39:37.304 --> 01:39:39.389
I know that for you and your people.

1517
01:39:39.473 --> 01:39:41.767
the retirement farewell
is an important moment.

1518
01:39:43.309 --> 01:39:45.062
Well. you didn't have the chance.

1519
01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:47.731
You couldn't have the low flight either.

1520
01:39:48.148 --> 01:39:50.442
but you'll be able to cross
the water bridge

1521
01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:53.112
because there's a plane waiting for you.

1522
01:39:54.029 --> 01:39:55.406
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

1523
01:40:16.175 --> 01:40:17.219
Are you ready?

1524
01:41:35.005 --> 01:41:36.048
MATE

1525
01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:46.433
-Hello?
-Hello. from Santa Clara Taxis.

1526
01:41:47.309 --> 01:41:48.393
I'll patch you through.

1527
01:41:50.103 --> 01:41:53.690
IN MEMORY OF JULIETA VALLINA
AND EDUARDO BARREIRO
