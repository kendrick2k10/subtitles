366

to Elijah Bards.

[Frank]
Mm. The victim was a medium.

372
00:16:00.917 --> 00:16:03.625
Maybe she was killed
by Elijah's angry ghost.

373
00:16:05.792 --> 00:16:08.583
The police file said
that he had a son. Henry Bards.

- Henry?
- Yeah.

375
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.875
He's the one who sold the gun
to the pawn shop.

was hidden.

You must be
part psychic yourself.

That's right. Todd.

392
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.875

"following the lead."

so much money on her.

976
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.959
is that Rose gave me
love and guidance in return.

How's your trip been so far?

1443
00:57:33.834 --> 00:57:35.959
Oh. you know.
being back with Mom and Dad

1444
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.291
it's the best.

1445
00:57:37.333 --> 00:57:39.125
Your mom is a riot.

1446
00:57:39.166 --> 00:57:41.166
I still can't believe
she hired a skywriter

1447
00:57:41.208 --> 00:57:44.125
when you graduated top of
your class in medical school.

1448
00:57:44.166 --> 00:57:45.875
[both laughing]

1449
00:57:45.917 --> 00:57:48.291
[sighs]

1450
00:57:48.333 --> 00:57:51.250
Hey. do you remember
when we went up to Victoria

1451
00:57:51.291 --> 00:57:54.250
and sat on that whale-watching
boat for six hours.

1452
00:57:54.291 --> 00:57:55.542
and me.
I didn't even see a thing.

1453
00:57:55.583 --> 00:57:57.291
because all I could notice
was you.

1454
00:57:58.542 --> 00:57:59.959
Then we walked back
from the marina

1455
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.333
in the pouring rain.

1456
00:58:01.375 --> 00:58:03.166
And we ducked into
that antique shop.

1457
00:58:03.208 --> 00:58:05.083
and there it was.
in the display case...

1458
00:58:05.125 --> 00:58:08.542
princess cut.
rubies all around it.

1459
00:58:08.583 --> 00:58:10.792
It was
the perfect engagement ring.

1460
00:58:10.834 --> 00:58:12.667
Yeah. it was.

1461
00:58:12.709 --> 00:58:14.667
I still have it. you know.

1462
00:58:14.709 --> 00:58:16.083
You do?

1463
00:58:17.375 --> 00:58:19.250
Mm-hmm.

1464
00:58:21.166 --> 00:58:23.709
[sighs]
What are we doing?

1465
00:58:24.917 --> 00:58:27.125
Getting reacquainted.

1466
00:58:28.208 --> 00:58:29.125
[sighs]

1467
00:58:29.166 --> 00:58:30.834
So...

1468
00:58:30.875 --> 00:58:33.375
will you be my date
to the reunion?

1469
00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.041
Hi. Kiki.

1470
00:58:36.083 --> 00:58:37.709
Two nights this week.

1471
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:39.166
What do you kids want?

1472
00:58:39.208 --> 00:58:40.709
Coffee? Dessert?

1473
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:43.333
I will take another slice
of your apple pie. of course.

1474
00:58:43.375 --> 00:58:45.083
She will have ice cream.

1475
00:58:45.125 --> 00:58:46.834
Strawberry. right?

1476
00:58:50.667 --> 00:58:53.333
I'm... I'm good. Kiki.

1477
00:58:53.375 --> 00:58:54.500
I'll just have coffee.

1478
00:58:55.583 --> 00:58:57.417
Thanks.

1479
00:59:00.083 --> 00:59:01.291
♪ ♪

1480
00:59:03.583 --> 00:59:05.959
How hard is it to remember
vanilla ice cream?

1481
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.583
It's the most boring flavor
on the planet.

1482
00:59:08.625 --> 00:59:10.417
So that's it?

1483
00:59:10.458 --> 00:59:13.667
You're gonna let ice cream
determine your future?

1484
00:59:13.709 --> 00:59:15.166
What future?

1485
00:59:15.208 --> 00:59:17.709
It's not like
he was down on one knee.

1486
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:19.750
It's not that simple.

1487
00:59:19.792 --> 00:59:22.041
How does
Jake factor into all this?

1488
00:59:22.083 --> 00:59:23.667
[sighs]

1489
00:59:23.709 --> 00:59:26.333
We're just friends.

1490
00:59:26.375 --> 00:59:28.709
I'm not even sure we're that.
half the time.

1491
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:30.667
Would you get back together
with Luke.

1492
00:59:30.709 --> 00:59:32.417
if he asked?

1493
00:59:32.458 --> 00:59:34.792
I don't know.

1494
00:59:34.834 --> 00:59:37.834
He's smart. funny. handsome.

1495
00:59:39.166 --> 00:59:40.458
He's perfect on paper.

1496
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:43.542
Yeah. so are
fish and chips. Ruby.

1497
00:59:43.583 --> 00:59:47.583
Question is.
is he perfect for you?

1498
00:59:47.625 --> 00:59:50.041
Can we change the subject?

1499
00:59:50.083 --> 00:59:51.542
Anything?

1500
00:59:51.583 --> 00:59:53.375
Like the case.

1501
00:59:53.417 --> 00:59:55.417
And that's
your not-so-subtle way

1502
00:59:55.458 --> 00:59:57.375
of telling your old man
to butt out. got it.

1503
00:59:57.417 --> 01:00:00.709
Hey. no. You know
that I always value your advice.

1504
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:02.375
You are the smartest man
that I know.

1505
01:00:02.417 --> 01:00:04.333
Ohh.

1506
01:00:04.375 --> 01:00:06.375
So.

1507
01:00:06.417 --> 01:00:09.041
Fill me in.

1508
01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:12.291
I went to see Rose's ex.
a boat captain.

1509
01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:13.583
Rough character. right?

1510
01:00:13.625 --> 01:00:14.792
Yeah.

1511
01:00:14.834 --> 01:00:17.041
But with a good alibi.

1512
01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:18.709
So?

1513
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.834
He was accused
of killing someone

1514
01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:22.125
on a fishing boat.

1515
01:00:22.166 --> 01:00:23.500
Really?

1516
01:00:23.542 --> 01:00:25.500
What was his alibi again?

1517
01:00:25.542 --> 01:00:27.834
He was out on one of
his dinner cruises

1518
01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:29.709
when Rose was murdered.

1519
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:32.125
And the police are 100% sure?

1520
01:00:32.166 --> 01:00:35.792
I mean. apparently. it was
in the harbormaster's log.

1521
01:00:35.834 --> 01:00:38.667
The boat was definitely
on the Sound that night.

1522
01:00:38.709 --> 01:00:41.125
Maybe worth verifying yourself?

1523
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.000
See? Smartest man I know.

1524
01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:46.417
[chuckles]

1525
01:00:46.458 --> 01:00:48.166
Thanks for the walk.

1526
01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:49.375
Well. you'll figure it out.

1527
01:00:49.417 --> 01:00:51.875
and I'm always here
if you need me.

1528
01:00:51.917 --> 01:00:52.834
Love you. Dad.

1529
01:00:52.875 --> 01:00:55.250
Love you.

1530
01:00:56.667 --> 01:00:57.917
Can I help you?

1531
01:00:57.959 --> 01:00:59.333
Mr. Fontana?

1532
01:00:59.375 --> 01:01:01.041
At your service.

1533
01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:03.041
Ruby Herring. 57 News.

1534
01:01:03.083 --> 01:01:05.000
I hear you keep a log
of the boats that go out.

1535
01:01:05.041 --> 01:01:07.083
Sure do. Goes back decades.

1536
01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:09.166
We got a good. old-fashioned
filing system.

1537
01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:10.375
Pencil and paper.

1538
01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:12.000
I don't like change much.

1539
01:01:12.041 --> 01:01:13.250
What do you need?

1540
01:01:13.291 --> 01:01:17.500
I was looking for the log
from March 22. 2015.

1541
01:01:17.542 --> 01:01:19.500
Emerald Cove Tour boats
apparently went out.

1542
01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:21.291
helmed by Captain Kirk.

1543
01:01:21.333 --> 01:01:22.750
I'll get that for you.

1544
01:01:22.792 --> 01:01:23.709
That's a popular log.

1545
01:01:25.417 --> 01:01:26.458
A detective came by.

1546
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.375
said he wanted to look
at that. too.

1547
01:01:28.417 --> 01:01:30.709
I've got it right here.
Yeah.

1548
01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:36.583
Let's see... March 22nd.

1549
01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:39.375
Yep.

1550
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:42.875
"Captain Richard Kirk."

1551
01:01:42.917 --> 01:01:45.333
He said he has a son.
Do you know his name?

1552
01:01:45.375 --> 01:01:46.458
Sure do.

1553
01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.625
"Captain Kirk Junior."

1554
01:01:48.667 --> 01:01:52.166
Could he have been the one
operating that night?

1555
01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:54.125
Did anyone confirm
with the guests

1556
01:01:54.166 --> 01:01:56.834
that it was actually
Richard Kirk Senior?

1557
01:01:56.875 --> 01:01:58.000
Well. I don't know.

1558
01:01:58.041 --> 01:01:59.917
but that boat goes out
like clockwork

1559
01:01:59.959 --> 01:02:02.083
every night. 7:00.
Senior at the helm.

1560
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:06.291
Would you have a list
of the guests from that night?

1561
01:02:06.333 --> 01:02:08.834
Oh. that'd be long gone by now.

1562
01:02:10.375 --> 01:02:12.917
But there is one thing that
we do computerize around here.

1563
01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:15.667
We started saving
video surveillance

1564
01:02:15.709 --> 01:02:16.625
about five years ago...

1565
01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:18.500
liability purposes.

1566
01:02:18.542 --> 01:02:20.709
The detective
never took a look at this?

1567
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:22.500
Well. he seemed satisfied
with the log...

1568
01:02:22.542 --> 01:02:24.250
that. and he had an eyewitness.

1569
01:02:24.291 --> 01:02:26.375
Me.

1570
01:02:26.417 --> 01:02:28.875
I saw Richard get on the boat
that night.

1571
01:02:28.917 --> 01:02:30.166
just before 7:00.

1572
01:02:30.208 --> 01:02:31.917
There it is.

1573
01:02:31.959 --> 01:02:34.000
Just like the log said...

1574
01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:38.583
Boat took off
7:00 p.m. that night.

1575
01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:40.417
Can you go back to before
the passengers got on?

1576
01:02:40.458 --> 01:02:41.750
Mm.

1577
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:47.709
Is that his son?

1578
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:48.583
Yeah. that's him.

1579
01:02:50.917 --> 01:02:52.667
Son of a gun.

1580
01:02:52.709 --> 01:02:54.583
Senior traded places
with Junior.

1581
01:02:54.625 --> 01:02:56.625
Do you mind if
I record this with my phone?

1582
01:02:56.667 --> 01:02:58.750
No.

1583
01:03:01.625 --> 01:03:03.041
You think that detective's
gonna want to see this?

1584
01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:05.792
Oh. you can count on it.

1585
01:03:05.834 --> 01:03:08.375
It's not my fault
my son didn't write "Junior"

1586
01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:09.917
at the end of his name
on the log.

1587
01:03:09.959 --> 01:03:11.291
He's my back-up.

1588
01:03:11.333 --> 01:03:12.375
Yeah. but still.

1589
01:03:12.417 --> 01:03:13.875
you lied
to the original detective

1590
01:03:13.917 --> 01:03:15.542
about being on the boat
that night.

1591
01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:16.875
Why?

1592
01:03:16.917 --> 01:03:18.458
Didn't feel like
getting tangled up

1593
01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.125
in another investigation.

1594
01:03:20.166 --> 01:03:23.291
You know we can add "perjury"
to your extensive rap sheet.

1595
01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:25.959
Better than "murder."

1596
01:03:29.041 --> 01:03:30.875
Where'd you go that night?

1597
01:03:30.917 --> 01:03:32.792
After you left the boat.

1598
01:03:33.834 --> 01:03:35.291
[sighs]

1599
01:03:36.458 --> 01:03:37.917
To see Rose.

1600
01:03:37.959 --> 01:03:39.500
To talk.

1601
01:03:39.542 --> 01:03:41.542
About what?

1602
01:03:41.583 --> 01:03:43.792
I wanted her back.

1603
01:03:43.834 --> 01:03:46.125
I mean. it's not every day
a pretty pearl like her

1604
01:03:46.166 --> 01:03:48.375
is into an old barnacle like me.

1605
01:03:48.417 --> 01:03:49.583
How'd she feel about that?

1606
01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.709
Ah. she was done with me.

1607
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:54.083
So I said goodbye and left.

1608
01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:56.000
I'm not one to beg.

1609
01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:58.542
I heard you took it
a lot harder than that.

1610
01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:00.792
Look. I didn't do it.

1611
01:04:00.834 --> 01:04:02.875
There was no way
I'm going back to the joint.

1612
01:04:02.917 --> 01:04:05.417
I spent a year in there
before my trial.

1613
01:04:05.458 --> 01:04:07.375
Never again.

1614
01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:17.291
How did Killian miss this?

1615
01:04:17.333 --> 01:04:19.709
I kinda got there first.

1616
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:20.959
Beat the brass? Nice.

1617
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.792
He's interviewing
Captain Kirk as we speak.

1618
01:04:23.834 --> 01:04:26.417
You think "beam me up. Scottie"

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:56.500

earlier than she said she did?

with her breakup with Henry

1810

She has no real job.

1813

that he's having a baby...

wrong about Henry.

2017
