3
00:01:08.903 --> 00:01:10.154
Mr. Lansky.

4
00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.865
why are the American authorities
after you?

5
00:01:13.324 --> 00:01:15.618
Well. apparently some
newspaper man wrote

6
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:18.329
that I had 300 million dollars.

7
00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.498
Is it true?

8
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.666
I wish I had a million dollars.

9
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.753
They accuse me
of making a president.

10
00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:27.797
Now. I don't know Mr. Nixon
any more

11
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.091
than what I've read
in the newspapers.

12
00:01:30.174 --> 00:01:33.469
They claim I have 50 percent
of Lebanon casinos.

13
00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:35.554
50 percent of Monte Carlo.

14
00:01:35.638 --> 00:01:38.224
Now how ridiculous
can we really get?

15
00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:39.934
Mr. Lansky.
is there such a thing

16
00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:41.894
as organized crime?

17
00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:49.110
I have no knowledge
on the subject.

18
00:02:00.246 --> 00:02:01.330
<i>Listen Eva.</i>

19
00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:02.498
<i>I'm in Florida. honey.</i>

20
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:03.874
<i>Daddy's here for work.</i>

21
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.168
<i>What do they have here?</i>

22
00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:09.797
<i>They have oranges and gators
and Mickey Mouse.</i>

23
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.216
<i>Next time we can go
and I promise.</i>

24
00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:16.095
Okay Eva.
can you put your mama on?

25
00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:21.517
Christie. Christie.
Christie. please.

26
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.269
I know that the check bounced.

27
00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:24.854
Okay. but that's--

28
00:02:24.937 --> 00:02:26.105
Okay. That's why I'm in Miami.

29
00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:27.606
I'm going to do
some book signings.

30
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.525
Yeah. sure they are. they--

31
00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:31.610
They're putting me
in a fancy hotel.

32
00:02:31.694 --> 00:02:33.195
they're gonna give me the--

33
00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:38.909
Christie. I know
my responsibilities. all right?

34
00:02:40.578 --> 00:02:43.122
Look Christie.
I'm trying my best. all right?

35
00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:44.665
Trying my best.

36
00:04:20.678 --> 00:04:23.138
- David Stone.
- Mr. Lansky. it's a pleasure.

37
00:04:23.222 --> 00:04:24.348
How was your trip?

38
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.058
Fine. thanks. umm.

39
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:27.226
Hope you don't mind.
I got a coffee.

40
00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:28.644
You mind sitting down there?

41
00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:30.562
Uh. yeah sure.

42
00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:33.524
Thank you.

43
00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.863
Hello. Mr. Lansky. how are you?

44
00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:41.407
Fine. doll.

45
00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:43.284
How's your mother feel?

46
00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:45.995
Ah. good days and bad. you know.

47
00:04:46.078 --> 00:04:48.205
- It's a mission.
- Yeah. I know all about that.

48
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.707
What can I get for you. honey?

49
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.875
We'll do a couple of
Tom sandwiches.

50
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:55.254
Middle slice the fatty cut
and an assortment of pickles.

51
00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:56.755
So. the usual.

52
00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:58.590
I'll pick out the best ones.

53
00:04:58.674 --> 00:04:59.758
Thank you.

54
00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.679
I'd like you to remove that.

55
00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:07.850
Okay.

56
00:05:09.518 --> 00:05:10.894
You're from Pittsburgh.

57
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.648
You graduated on scholarship
with honors from Princeton.

58
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.985
You were on the crime beat at
the Fort Wayne <i>News-Sentinel</i>

59
00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.029
before you started
writing books.

60
00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:22.281
You've got a wife. Christina.
and two young children.

61
00:05:22.698 --> 00:05:23.907
Eva and Jack.

62
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:27.828
I make it a point of knowing
who I associate myself with.

63
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.374
Mr. Stone.
old business habits never die.

64
00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:38.130
It's a complicated thing.
isn't it? Marriage. children.

65
00:05:44.553 --> 00:05:48.640
I. uh... I've been reading
some articles about you.

66
00:05:48.724 --> 00:05:50.934
Forget all that.

67
00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:52.728
I'm here to tell you
the real story.

68
00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.814
All right. well. that's great.
cause I'm...

69
00:05:55.898 --> 00:05:57.649
I'm here to write
the real story.

70
00:05:57.733 --> 00:06:00.819
Four packs a day. 60 years.

71
00:06:00.903 --> 00:06:03.739
I finally work up the courage
to quit.

72
00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:05.574
A week later.
I go to see my doctor.

73
00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:06.700
He tells me I'm dying.

74
00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:11.789
As a writer. I thought you would
appreciate the irony in that.

75
00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:13.957
I do. I'm just--I'm very sorry
to hear that.

76
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:16.668
My circumstances offer me
the privilege

77
00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:19.254
to pick who I want
to tell my story.

78
00:06:19.338 --> 00:06:21.090
Your book on Kennedy
paid you well?

79
00:06:21.173 --> 00:06:23.217
- I did okay.
- It's been a few years

80
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.511
since lady luck visited you.

81
00:06:26.178 --> 00:06:29.014
Yeah. well history
doesn't always repeat itself.

82
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.226
When I was a young boy.

83
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:34.812
I spent my days
at the public library.

84
00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:37.147
I read everything

85
00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:40.401
and I have a particular interest
in history.

86
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.822
People see the same thing
from different perspectives.

87
00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.324
and that fascinates me.

88
00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:49.701
But what do you want from this?

89
00:06:49.785 --> 00:06:52.955
Why does David Stone want to
write a book about Meyer Lansky?

90
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:55.249
Oh.

91
00:07:00.838 --> 00:07:03.757
Everything that I've read
in history about you

92
00:07:03.841 --> 00:07:05.300
says you're a complicated man

93
00:07:05.384 --> 00:07:08.053
and maybe I like stories about
complicated people.

94
00:07:08.137 --> 00:07:12.057
And I think that your story.
the real story...

95
00:07:12.975 --> 00:07:14.143
I don't think
it's been told yet.

96
00:07:14.226 --> 00:07:15.686
and I don't think
it's about one man.

97
00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.354
I think
it's about the 20th century.

98
00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:22.025
That was quite a speech.

99
00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:23.527
but you didn't answer
the question.

100
00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.030
I need the money.

101
00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:30.451
Ah. there it is. the truth.

102
00:07:31.535 --> 00:07:33.537
When I die.
the book is yours to sell.

103
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:37.249
Until then. you will show
the manuscript to no one.

104
00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:40.377
Anything I choose to tell you
is off the record

105
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:42.963
until I give you permission
to put it in the book.

106
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.175
Without my approval. what
you have is a work of fiction.

107
00:07:46.258 --> 00:07:48.385
- I won't incriminate myself.
- Okay.

108
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:50.637
Any conversations
you have about me

109
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:52.306
outside of our meetings.

110
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:53.682
- I want to know.
- Sure.

111
00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:58.103
Betray me...
and there will be consequences.

112
00:07:59.188 --> 00:08:01.064
Are these terms
agreeable to you?

113
00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:04.067
Yes. sir.

114
00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:09.948
I hope our collaboration
will be a successful one.

115
00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:39.770
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey. Christie.

116
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:40.938
Christie. it's me.

117
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:42.523
<i>Hey. Oh. it's okay. baby.</i>

118
00:08:42.606 --> 00:08:43.774
<i>Mommy's got you.</i>

119
00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:45.442
You okay?

120
00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:47.444
You don't sound okay.

121
00:08:47.986 --> 00:08:49.071
<i>No. I'm not.</i>

122
00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:51.657
<i>Jack's got a 103 and he's not
holding his food down.</i>

123
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.866
Take him to a doctor.

124
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.034
<i>Excuse me?</i>

125
00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:55.577
<i>Of course
I took him to the doctor.</i>

126
00:08:55.953 --> 00:08:57.746
<i>Listen. I can't do this.
okay? Not now.</i>

127
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:58.997
Christie. I got a...

128
00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:00.916
I got the chance to write
a new book.

129
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.584
All right? And it could be--

130
00:09:02.668 --> 00:09:03.752
<i>Oh. David. no.</i>

131
00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:05.796
- Could be something really good.
<i>- Look.</i>

132
00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.714
<i>David.
I called your publisher.</i>

133
00:09:07.798 --> 00:09:09.716
<i>They had no idea
you were even in Miami.</i>

134
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.677
<i>which means
you are lying to me.</i>

135
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.220
<i>I can't do this.
I have to go.</i>

136
00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.363
<i>You said you read some stories</i>

137
00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:32.864
<i>about me in the papers.</i>

138
00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:35.242
My reputation has a habit
of preceding me.

139
00:09:35.826 --> 00:09:38.120
When they don't know you
they put labels on you.

140
00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:40.831
Master Stock Manipulator.

141
00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:45.127
America's most successful
casino operator in history.

142
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.461
Mob's accountant.

143
00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:49.131
The feds even leaked the story
to the press

144
00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:51.049
about me having
300 million dollars

145
00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:52.134
squirreled away.

146
00:09:54.011 --> 00:09:55.929
If you find out
who's out there guessing.

147
00:09:56.013 --> 00:09:57.472
please be sure to let me know.

148
00:09:57.556 --> 00:09:58.682
- Yeah.
- You don't get to keep it.

149
00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:00.434
call me
and I'll give you a piece.

150
00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:01.935
Fair enough.

151
00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:03.604
The labels. are they accurate?

152
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:06.315
It's your book.
You decide.

153
00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:07.441
Okay. all right.

154
00:10:07.858 --> 00:10:09.818
Okay.

155
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:14.281
Now. you strike me as a rather
obsequious guy. David.

156
00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:16.908
Quick to please.

157
00:10:16.992 --> 00:10:18.535
Never thought of myself
that way.

158
00:10:18.619 --> 00:10:19.953
- You're separated.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:10:20.037 --> 00:10:21.622
What does your wife
think about that?

160
00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:22.998
Did she find you that way?

161
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.001
We're here to talk about you.

162
00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:27.502
We are not here
to talk about me. Mr. Lansky.

163
00:10:27.586 --> 00:10:30.922
No. no. no. We have to talk
about you and me.

164
00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:35.177
- You know. I was married also.
- Yeah?

165
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.845
Yeah. twice.

166
00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:40.849
You know what they say.
can't live with them.

167
00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:41.933
can't shoot them.

168
00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:47.481
So where do we start?

169
00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:48.857
Let's start
when you were a child.

170
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:50.817
Russia.

171
00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.987
The only thing
I remember about Russia.

172
00:10:54.071 --> 00:10:57.240
is one day me and my uncle
crossing a path

173
00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:58.950
and some Cossacks
ordered my uncle

174
00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:00.827
to open his potato sack.

175
00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:02.788
And toss a potato up
in the air.

176
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.414
My Uncle obeyed.

177
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:08.377
Tossed a potato into the air.

178
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:13.215
and the Cossack takes out
this fucking sword and swoosh.

179
00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.135
He wasn't aiming for the potato.

180
00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.138
He was aiming
for my uncle's hand.

181
00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.266
Cut it right off.
Tough guys.

182
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.435
With swords.
We didn't have a sword.

183
00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.105
That was the difference.

184
00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:30.565
I never forgot that.

185
00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:35.237
I promised myself I'd never
be that helpless again.

186
00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:40.158
The next time I'll be the one
holding the knife.

187
00:11:40.242 --> 00:11:41.993
That's the only thing Russia
ever gave me.

188
00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:44.121
What I saw that day.

189
00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.543
made me stronger.
it sharpened me.

190
00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.842
I wish I knew where that
cocksucker was today.

191
00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.760
I'll show him
who the tough guy is.

192
00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:02.681
The real story starts
in America.

193
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:09.354
<i>By the time I was 10.</i>

194
00:12:09.438 --> 00:12:10.981
<i>I was sharp as a shiv.</i>

195
00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.150
<i>My mind was my escape</i>

196
00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.444
<i>and more than anything.
numbers.</i>

197
00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:17.988
<i>numbers gave my world
some order.</i>

198
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.407
<i>And for a kid with that kind
of interest in numbers.</i>

199
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.285
<i>there was nothing as thrilling
as a dice game.</i>

200
00:12:23.869 --> 00:12:25.412
<i>I would watch them play.</i>

201
00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:28.373
<i>But oh boy. if my old man
found out that was how</i>

202
00:12:28.457 --> 00:12:29.750
<i>I was spending my time...</i>

203
00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.920
My father? Everything he did.
he did for us.

204
00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:36.173
He was an honest man
earning an honest living.

205
00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:37.340
There's nothing wrong with that.

206
00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:38.925
He wasn't living his life.

207
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:41.428
His life was living him.

208
00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:42.721
I guess that's what we do.

209
00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:45.474
We measure ourselves
against our fathers.

210
00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:48.477
And you?
What was yours like?

211
00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.147
My father died when I was young.

212
00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:55.358
That must have been hard.

213
00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:02.949
So being an honest man.
Being an honest father.

214
00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:04.159
Yeah.

215
00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:06.411
Is that beneath you?

216
00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:12.292
What I knew was that
life wouldn't wait for me.

217
00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:20.592
<i>It all happened so fast.</i>

218
00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:23.470
<i>I put down the nickel
my mother gave me</i>

219
00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:24.805
<i>to pick up some bread.</i>

220
00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:28.934
<i>In a matter of seconds.</i>

221
00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:30.644
<i>my nickel was gone.</i>

222
00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:33.605
<i>Can you imagine having to tell
my mother and father</i>

223
00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.190
<i>why we couldn't eat
that night?</i>

224
00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:38.151
He took your money
and you just felt ashamed.

225
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:40.278
It was rage.

226
00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.698
You ever feel that. David?

227
00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:47.744
A rage so strong
it changes the path you're on?

228
00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.539
Never felt anything like that.

229
00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:52.916
There are people
in this world who will try to

230
00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.585
make you believe that
they are better than you.

231
00:13:56.545 --> 00:13:58.880
that they can win
at your expense.

232
00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:03.844
Rage is a tool we use
to look those people in the eye

233
00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:05.971
and prove them wrong.

234
00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.514
That's what drove you to win
at dice?

235
00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:09.766
It did much more than drive me
to win.

236
00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:12.519
It drove me to control the game.

237
00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:17.983
<i>I calculated the odds</i>

238
00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:19.067
<i>and payoffs.</i>

239
00:14:19.568 --> 00:14:21.862
<i>Watched how the probabilities
ebbed and flowed.</i>

240
00:14:22.946 --> 00:14:24.573
<i>but something
didn't make sense.</i>

241
00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.658
<i>I knew something was going on.</i>

242
00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.703
<i>something invisible
that no one else could see.</i>

243
00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.038
<i>And then I saw it.</i>

244
00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:42.173
<i>A blink of the eye.
a scratch of the ear.</i>

245
00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:44.885
<i>I figured out what these guys
were doing.</i>

246
00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:48.013
<i>They rigged the game.</i>

247
00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.723
<i>It was the outsider.</i>

248
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.475
<i>He was the one
controlling the game.</i>

249
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.022
And isn't that what we all want.
David?

250
00:14:57.898 --> 00:15:00.817
The only winners in gambling.
as in life.

251
00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:02.861
are those who control the game.

252
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.733
I think that you have the smile
of a beauty queen. all right?

253
00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:44.819
I do--no. I don't think that
they stick out.

254
00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:48.531
I don't think that
there's a huge gap. but...

255
00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:50.700
Look. if you think they're
gonna straighten out.

256
00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.619
then what's the point
of getting braces. right?

257
00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:53.745
<i>Mom's right.</i>

258
00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:55.872
Yeah. about what?

259
00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:57.582
<i>We can't afford it.</i>

260
00:15:57.666 --> 00:15:59.876
<i>That's why you don't want me
to get braces.</i>

261
00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:05.006
She say that?
Put your mama on. Eva? Hmm?

262
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.675
<i>She said she can't talk.</i>

263
00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:08.009
What do you mean she can't talk?

264
00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:10.261
Is she can't talk
or she won't talk?

265
00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:11.429
<i>She said she's not talking</i>

266
00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:13.348
<i>to you. Daddy.</i>

267
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.058
Give Mama a message.
all right?

268
00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.434
- Can you do that?
<i>- Okay.</i>

269
00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:19.062
And you tell her that the reason
that Daddy's in Miami

270
00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:20.981
is because of a man
called Meyer Lansky.

271
00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:22.148
<i>Meyor Lasky?</i>

272
00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:23.733
It's okay. she'll know
who that is.

273
00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:26.903
And you tell her that Mr. Lansky

274
00:16:26.987 --> 00:16:30.407
hired Daddy personally to
write a book about his life.

275
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.616
And every publisher's
gonna want it

276
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.784
and it's going to be
a best-seller.

277
00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:36.997
And when it is. Daddy's gonna
fix your smile. all right?

278
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.540
<i>Okay.</i>

279
00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:41.459
Because that's what daddies do.
Yeah?

280
00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:43.211
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Okay.

281
00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:45.463
Don't you worry
about your teeth.

282
00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:47.465
All right. you go tell her.

283
00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:48.633
<i>I love you. Daddy.</i>

284
00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:49.926
Okay. bye.

285
00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:57.934
Sorry.

286
00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.733
You look like hell.

287
00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:07.444
Yeah. I didn't get much sleep.

288
00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:11.781
Problems at home?

289
00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:17.120
Okay. umm.

290
00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.710
- Okay. today--
- These problems you're having.

291
00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.963
I hope they're not interfering
with your ability to work.

292
00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:30.008
I'm here. I'm fine.

293
00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.010
Good.

294
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.348
I want to talk
about Bugsy Siegel.

295
00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:38.725
It's Ben Siegel.

296
00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.102
Say that name again.

297
00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:44.439
<i>Ben Siegel. Bugsy.</i>

298
00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:46.066
<i>He and Lansky had
a bootlegging</i>

299
00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:47.233
<i>and gambling racket</i>

300
00:17:47.317 --> 00:17:49.444
<i>known as
the Bugs and Meyer Gang.</i>

301
00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.071
<i>They were more than partners.</i>

302
00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:53.114
<i>They were like brothers.</i>

303
00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:54.616
<i>Lansky handled the numbers.</i>

304
00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:56.076
<i>Bugsy was the muscle.</i>

305
00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:57.619
All right. Ben.

306
00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.746
Get! Up! Come on.

307
00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:01.539
I think he gets the point.

308
00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.208
<i>The only thing Bugsy enjoyed</i>

309
00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.085
<i>more than killing
was the ladies.</i>

310
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.462
<i>Or maybe it was
the other way around.</i>

311
00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:20.308
Luciano is looking for somebody

312
00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:22.393
to run his transportation
for him.

313
00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:28.024
We offer Lucky
a deal on his distribution

314
00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:29.859
too favorable to turn down.

315
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.029
Maybe we take a loss on it.

316
00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:37.492
A loss?
How's that makes sense?

317
00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:40.328
We'll be getting in on
the ground up with Lucky Luciano

318
00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:43.289
and it will supply liquor
for our own operation

319
00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:44.666
at the same time.

320
00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.919
Profit margins
are justified tenfold.

321
00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:51.673
I did the math for you.

322
00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:52.882
Yeah. I'm sure you did.

323
00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:58.388
What do you think of that guy.
Rosen?

324
00:18:58.471 --> 00:18:59.848
He's friendly.

325
00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:01.850
Gets along with the clientele.
why?

326
00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:03.268
He should lose the ring.

327
00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:06.020
It's distracting.

328
00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:08.314
Sends the wrong message.

329
00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.361
Rosen. why are you
so fucking happy?

330
00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:14.529
<i>Our operation</i>

331
00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:15.822
<i>was expanding fast.</i>

332
00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:16.990
I am winning big.

333
00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:18.867
<i>We had to
keep our books clean.</i>

334
00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:21.619
<i>keep the authorities
off the money trail.</i>

335
00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:25.123
<i>If you're on a leaky boat.
you plug the holes.</i>

336
00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:27.000
You're over by 200.

337
00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:29.335
It was a good day
at the track.

338
00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:32.589
Yeah?
Explain the numbers to me.

339
00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:42.515
Uh. I had 9.320
on the seven at--

340
00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:46.227
573 against the favorite.

341
00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:49.689
But you heard Green Emerald
was a winner.

342
00:19:49.772 --> 00:19:51.983
So you. what?
You sweeten the pot?

343
00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:55.570
You got to admit it.
He is good.

344
00:19:57.363 --> 00:19:59.324
Yeah. well. I couldn't lose.

345
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.912
What did I tell you?
Trust your memory.

346
00:20:03.995 --> 00:20:07.665
I--I know. I just got a lot
of numbers to remember.

347
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.169
You know how many gambling rooms
I run in this town?

348
00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:16.758
The fact that you don't know
puts us at an advantage.

349
00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:19.552
You also got no idea
how much money

350
00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:21.512
comes through that door
each day. do you?

351
00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:24.182
You know why?

352
00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:27.352
The only one who knows is me

353
00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:31.064
and I keep that number
in my head.

354
00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:36.444
But you do know the percentage
of our bets don't you?

355
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.739
- 10 percent.
- 10 percent win or lose.

356
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.867
That's what sustains
this business.

357
00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.495
Jimmy. is there anything
else you want to tell us?

358
00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:48.373
Who else is gambling
with our money. maybe?

359
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.918
I swear. Bugsy.
I don't know nothing.

360
00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:56.297
Did you just call me Bugsy?

361
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:00.176
E--

362
00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:04.597
Everybody calls you that.
at least when you're not around.

363
00:21:07.725 --> 00:21:10.812
Well. now I'm confused.

364
00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:13.815
Am I not standing here?

365
00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:16.109
What am I?

366
00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:18.569
Am I a figment
of your imagination?

367
00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:19.737
No.

368
00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:21.864
No. no. because
that's what you just said.

369
00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:23.992
That's what people call me
when I'm not around.

370
00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:26.452
But I'm right here.

371
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.957
Meyer. do you... see me?

372
00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:32.750
I see you. Benny.

373
00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:37.213
I'm going to ask you
one more time. Jimmy.

374
00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:43.553
Is there anything else
you want to tell us?

375
00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:46.848
- No. I--
- Don't lie to me.

376
00:21:53.604 --> 00:21:55.398
Don't forget to breathe.

377
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:56.858
They say breathings good.

378
00:21:58.067 --> 00:21:59.235
Okay.

379
00:22:00.778 --> 00:22:04.532
Now. tell me what I wanna know.

380
00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:13.666
Um. I. uh... I--I may have heard
something about a dealer

381
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:16.961
at your room on Allen.

382
00:22:17.712 --> 00:22:19.505
I-I don't remember his name.

383
00:22:19.589 --> 00:22:21.215
Well. let me jog your memory.
huh?

384
00:22:23.593 --> 00:22:27.513
Rosen.
his name is Rosen.

385
00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:29.474
And what exactly
did he tell you?

386
00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:32.018
He was tipping off some players.

387
00:22:32.101 --> 00:22:34.604
I don't know anything else.
I swear.

388
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.317
Sit up.

389
00:22:39.942 --> 00:22:41.361
Thank you. Jimmy.

390
00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:44.072
It's very helpful for us.
you know.

391
00:22:45.365 --> 00:22:49.077
Oh. at least you die
with a clean conscience. right?

392
00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:51.287
Who?

393
00:22:51.746 --> 00:22:52.747
You.

394
00:22:53.915 --> 00:22:57.627
God dammit
Next time. not in my ear.

395
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:07.845
First time me and you
met and here comes little Meyer.

396
00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:10.890
walking through the snow
like the wandering Jew.

397
00:23:11.474 --> 00:23:12.558
And my guys. I mean.

398
00:23:12.642 --> 00:23:14.435
there must've been like
six of us or something. huh?

399
00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:15.603
- Seven.
- We ask him to

400
00:23:15.686 --> 00:23:17.939
empty his pockets.
if he wants to cross the street.

401
00:23:18.022 --> 00:23:20.358
Ask?
I don't recall any asking.

402
00:23:21.526 --> 00:23:24.695
We politely instructed him
to remove the contents

403
00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:25.988
of his pockets.

404
00:23:26.364 --> 00:23:28.408
<i>Charlie Lucky Luciano.</i>

405
00:23:28.491 --> 00:23:30.493
<i>father of modern
organized crime.</i>

406
00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:32.370
<i>He created the governing body
of the Mafia</i>

407
00:23:32.453 --> 00:23:33.538
<i>known as The Commission</i>

408
00:23:33.621 --> 00:23:35.790
<i>and the National
Crime Syndicate.</i>

409
00:23:35.873 --> 00:23:39.252
<i>Confederation of Italian.
Jewish. and Irish Gangsters.</i>

410
00:23:39.335 --> 00:23:41.003
And you know
what he says to us?

411
00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:44.841
"Go fuck yourselves.
you guinea bastards."

412
00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:48.094
That's right and the balls
on this one. huh?

413
00:23:49.595 --> 00:23:50.972
I swear he would have
fought all six of us

414
00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:52.056
before giving up a penny.

415
00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.934
So what do I do?
I let him go.

416
00:23:55.685 --> 00:23:58.479
Kid as fearless as that
deserves to be rewarded.

417
00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:01.649
How many times I've gotta hear
this story. huh. Lucky?

418
00:24:01.732 --> 00:24:04.527
Eh. this story is like wine.
Benny.

419
00:24:04.944 --> 00:24:06.446
Gets better with age.

420
00:24:06.988 --> 00:24:08.156
I prefer whiskey.

421
00:24:08.239 --> 00:24:09.490
The point is...

422
00:24:10.992 --> 00:24:16.164
you and me. Meyer. Italian. Jew.
none of that matters.

423
00:24:16.247 --> 00:24:18.875
What matters is the way
we see the world.

424
00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:21.043
We fight our way in
from the outside.

425
00:24:21.544 --> 00:24:22.879
That's right.

426
00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:26.132
This distribution business
you proposing.

427
00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:28.426
we got ourselves a deal.

428
00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:31.971
I'll drink to that.

429
00:24:41.355 --> 00:24:42.815
See that hat check girl?

430
00:24:43.983 --> 00:24:46.569
See how she's jotting
everything down?

431
00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:49.572
Who's coming. who's going.
who's talking to who?

432
00:24:50.865 --> 00:24:54.827
That all goes to Lucky.
It's attention to detail.

433
00:24:55.995 --> 00:24:58.956
That's what makes Lucky. Lucky.

434
00:25:00.374 --> 00:25:02.293
I'm paying attention
to a different detail.

435
00:25:03.544 --> 00:25:04.879
Be right back.

436
00:25:16.641 --> 00:25:18.017
Have a seat.

437
00:25:20.728 --> 00:25:21.812
This is my friend. Meyer.

438
00:25:21.896 --> 00:25:25.483
Meyer. please meet
Anne and Louise.

439
00:25:25.566 --> 00:25:26.776
Hello.

440
00:25:30.613 --> 00:25:31.989
Now tell me something.
what are two lovely ladies

441
00:25:32.073 --> 00:25:33.616
like yourself doing
in a place like this?

442
00:25:35.034 --> 00:25:37.286
The sign outside said
it was a drugstore.

443
00:25:37.787 --> 00:25:39.413
I needed some toothpaste.

444
00:25:42.083 --> 00:25:43.084
So what are you guys.

445
00:25:43.459 --> 00:25:44.919
professional gamblers
or something?

446
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.590
Oh! Us? No. No. no. no.

447
00:25:49.674 --> 00:25:51.300
Then what line
of business are you in?

448
00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:54.136
Truck rentals.

449
00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.556
Truck rentals?
What does that mean?

450
00:25:56.931 --> 00:25:58.432
Means we rent trucks.

451
00:25:58.516 --> 00:26:00.977
Anne. look.

452
00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:04.564
It's that big cheese gangster
from the newsreels.

453
00:26:05.022 --> 00:26:07.108
They say he murdered
his own cousin.

454
00:26:08.192 --> 00:26:09.777
- Louise.
- What?

455
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.030
Hey. how's about I go
over there tell him to. uh.

456
00:26:13.573 --> 00:26:16.033
come give you a good old kiss
on the lips.

457
00:26:16.117 --> 00:26:17.577
Very funny.

458
00:26:19.537 --> 00:26:20.538
Okay.

459
00:26:24.542 --> 00:26:27.628
What the hell?
Is he really doing it?

460
00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:33.009
Oh. my God.
he's looking right at us.

461
00:26:34.343 --> 00:26:35.511
Let's get out of here.

462
00:26:36.304 --> 00:26:38.055
I'm not going anywhere.

463
00:26:39.056 --> 00:26:43.102
The man is a killer
and these guys are his friends.

464
00:26:46.522 --> 00:26:47.857
They seem harmless.

465
00:26:50.818 --> 00:26:52.028
Suit yourself.

466
00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:04.624
So you're in the truck
rental business?

467
00:27:10.838 --> 00:27:12.131
Cold?

468
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:21.307
You need a coat. Hm?

469
00:27:22.266 --> 00:27:23.893
Are you going to buy me one?

470
00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:32.818
Fur.

471
00:27:36.238 --> 00:27:37.490
Mink.

472
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:45.831
Leather trim
down to the knees.

473
00:27:49.835 --> 00:27:52.004
And what will you do
with the rest?

474
00:27:55.257 --> 00:27:56.467
This?

475
00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:01.764
This I'm going to keep
for our future.

476
00:28:30.167 --> 00:28:31.419
Not too cold?

477
00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:36.549
It's refreshing.

478
00:28:36.632 --> 00:28:39.552
Oh. it's cold.

479
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.471
You're. uh. crazy.
Would you like one?

480
00:28:44.348 --> 00:28:45.850
Sure. why not.

481
00:28:48.185 --> 00:28:50.980
Thank you. I'm Maureen.

482
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.523
I'm David.

483
00:28:57.445 --> 00:28:58.446
You're a writer.

484
00:28:59.488 --> 00:29:00.865
Yeah. How do you know that?

485
00:29:01.949 --> 00:29:03.576
I hear you typing at night?

486
00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:04.744
Yeah?

487
00:29:04.827 --> 00:29:05.911
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

488
00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.497
Yeah. the walls are pretty thin.

489
00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.418
Mm-hm. Spy novels?

490
00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:15.171
I'm just here doing research.

491
00:29:15.254 --> 00:29:16.964
On women in swimming pools?

492
00:29:19.425 --> 00:29:20.426
That's good. You're quick.

493
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.386
Very quick.

494
00:29:25.181 --> 00:29:27.016
What about you?
Are you on vacation?

495
00:29:28.601 --> 00:29:29.602
Something like that.

496
00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:37.485
Doctor. are you telling us that
Buddy will have to wear a brace

497
00:29:37.568 --> 00:29:39.069
the rest of his life?

498
00:29:42.573 --> 00:29:44.784
If you'd like. I'd be happy
to recommend specialists

499
00:29:44.867 --> 00:29:46.452
who are developing
a new treatment

500
00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:47.620
for cerebral palsy.

501
00:29:47.703 --> 00:29:49.580
Answer the goddamn question.

502
00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:55.211
In my professional opinion. yes.
He will.

503
00:30:06.013 --> 00:30:07.640
The doctor said
there was no chance

504
00:30:07.723 --> 00:30:09.099
he would ever be normal.

505
00:30:09.642 --> 00:30:11.185
And you couldn't accept that?

506
00:30:12.228 --> 00:30:15.689
I wasn't about to let my son
become weak and vulnerable.

507
00:30:15.773 --> 00:30:16.857
No.

508
00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:19.693
Not if I could help it.

509
00:30:20.361 --> 00:30:22.196
Why did that bother you so much?

510
00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:23.280
Why do you think?

511
00:30:30.704 --> 00:30:34.625
Would it not bother you to see
your own son go through his life

512
00:30:35.042 --> 00:30:36.627
at such a disadvantage?

513
00:30:38.963 --> 00:30:40.422
I couldn't accept the odds.

514
00:30:42.383 --> 00:30:43.467
The odds?

515
00:30:43.551 --> 00:30:45.636
It was a mathematical
equation.

516
00:30:45.719 --> 00:30:48.931
the proportion of those
afflicted versus those cured.

517
00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.100
the rate at which
those afflicted

518
00:30:51.183 --> 00:30:52.852
were able to walk again.

519
00:30:52.935 --> 00:30:54.186
I ran the numbers to my head.

520
00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.437
I made the calculations.

521
00:30:55.521 --> 00:30:57.273
You thought
you could beat the odds?

522
00:30:57.982 --> 00:30:58.983
Yes.

523
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:02.319
What about faith?

524
00:31:03.195 --> 00:31:05.155
- Faith?
- Mm-hmm.

525
00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:06.448
Maybe God wanted him
to be like that.

526
00:31:06.532 --> 00:31:07.533
Who?

527
00:31:10.786 --> 00:31:15.791
Hello. God. hello?
Hell-fucking-Io.

528
00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:18.544
I ain't hearing anybody
answer me.

529
00:31:18.627 --> 00:31:20.212
Maybe he's got nothing
he wants to tell you.

530
00:31:21.463 --> 00:31:25.217
And he made that clear.
didn't he?

531
00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:29.805
You okay?

532
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:32.558
Let's do this.

533
00:31:44.403 --> 00:31:46.989
Come on you.

534
00:31:47.072 --> 00:31:50.951
Shut up. Rosen..

535
00:31:59.543 --> 00:32:01.420
Get down. come on. get down.

536
00:32:02.004 --> 00:32:05.299
Please. don't do anything
to him. please!

537
00:32:05.382 --> 00:32:07.551
Hey. hey. woah. woah. woah.
enough.

538
00:32:07.635 --> 00:32:09.053
Hey. what the fuck
is she doing here?

539
00:32:09.136 --> 00:32:10.262
Well you told me
to bring her down.

540
00:32:10.346 --> 00:32:13.140
Please. please. he's a good man.

541
00:32:13.223 --> 00:32:16.143
He's a father.
We have three children. please.

542
00:32:16.226 --> 00:32:17.645
- Oh. God.
- Get up.

543
00:32:17.728 --> 00:32:20.564
Oh. here.
this is for you.

544
00:32:21.482 --> 00:32:24.985
Your husband has been stealing
from me for years. Mrs. Rosen.

545
00:32:25.778 --> 00:32:28.489
A nickel at a time.
but nickels adds up.

546
00:32:28.572 --> 00:32:32.952
Mrs. Rosen. you knew about this.
didn't you?

547
00:32:34.453 --> 00:32:36.455
No.

548
00:32:37.498 --> 00:32:38.540
It's okay.

549
00:32:43.921 --> 00:32:45.172
This is a warning.

550
00:32:46.423 --> 00:32:49.802
But if you ever mention what
you see here today to anyone.

551
00:32:50.886 --> 00:32:55.975
you'll be putting your life
and your children's in danger.

552
00:32:58.727 --> 00:33:00.479
- You understand?
- Mm-hm.

553
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:03.732
Get her out of here.

554
00:33:06.527 --> 00:33:08.445
May I help you up. Mrs. Rosen?

555
00:33:08.529 --> 00:33:10.406
Come on. here we go.

556
00:33:13.158 --> 00:33:14.702
Don't worry about him.
he's okay.

557
00:33:18.247 --> 00:33:19.373
Where were you?

558
00:33:19.999 --> 00:33:22.793
She was a mess. boss.
I was trying to be delicate.

559
00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:29.717
Never let your emotions dictate
your actions ever again.

560
00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:27.816
So you left them fatherless?

561
00:34:28.192 --> 00:34:29.485
Three children.

562
00:34:29.568 --> 00:34:31.695
He left them fatherless.

563
00:34:32.696 --> 00:34:35.032
Is that what you tell yourself.
so you can sleep at night?

564
00:34:35.115 --> 00:34:36.617
No. I don't have to tell myself
anything

565
00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:38.202
when I go to sleep at night.

566
00:34:39.495 --> 00:34:41.830
It's the way we live.
It's business.

567
00:34:43.916 --> 00:34:46.085
What do you want.
a fucking fairy tale. David?

568
00:34:46.168 --> 00:34:48.170
Go home and write a fairy tale.

569
00:34:48.796 --> 00:34:49.880
<i>I want you to write</i>

570
00:34:49.963 --> 00:34:51.048
<i>a book about me.</i>

571
00:34:51.131 --> 00:34:52.841
<i>Would that be
of interest to you?</i>

572
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.843
<i>Yeah. uh.</i>

573
00:34:54.927 --> 00:34:56.637
<i>I'd be
very interested in that.</i>

574
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.013
<i>Good. I'll need you</i>

575
00:34:58.097 --> 00:34:59.098
<i>to come to Miami.</i>

576
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.226
<i>There's a coffee shop
not far from where I live.</i>

577
00:35:02.309 --> 00:35:03.852
<i>Take down this address.</i>

578
00:35:04.478 --> 00:35:05.479
Okay?

579
00:35:06.522 --> 00:35:07.773
We need more resources.

580
00:35:08.232 --> 00:35:11.193
You been at this how long.
Frank? 15 years?

581
00:35:12.152 --> 00:35:13.570
You got all the surveillance
you asked for.

582
00:35:13.654 --> 00:35:15.114
What else are you expecting
to find here?

583
00:35:15.197 --> 00:35:18.784
The 300 million dollars that
Lansky has stashed away.

584
00:35:18.867 --> 00:35:21.036
This guy. Stone. can really
open the door for us.

585
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.287
Opening the door?

586
00:35:22.955 --> 00:35:24.790
There are no more doors to open.
Frank.

587
00:35:25.249 --> 00:35:28.544
Tax evasion. contempt of court.
they threw it all away.

588
00:35:29.545 --> 00:35:30.921
And no indictment.

589
00:35:32.005 --> 00:35:33.757
Lansky's impenetrable.

590
00:35:33.841 --> 00:35:35.717
But that was 10 years ago.

591
00:35:36.135 --> 00:35:37.928
And where's he been
for the last 10 years?

592
00:35:38.428 --> 00:35:40.556
Federal prison? No.

593
00:35:41.265 --> 00:35:44.268
Collins Avenue walking
that little Shih Tzu of his

594
00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:46.228
up and down the boardwalk
with a smug face.

595
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.230
It's an embarrassment. frankly.

596
00:35:48.313 --> 00:35:50.149
- We can fix that.
- Oh. yeah and how's that. Greg?

597
00:35:51.567 --> 00:35:53.485
Even if that money
is out there somewhere.

598
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:55.028
we don't have the budget
to keep digging holes

599
00:35:55.112 --> 00:35:56.321
to know where to
try to find it.

600
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.741
We're talking about the most
notorious gangster

601
00:35:59.825 --> 00:36:01.160
in American history.

602
00:36:01.243 --> 00:36:02.744
We're just asking
for a little rope.

603
00:36:03.579 --> 00:36:06.790
A little rope. so you two can
hang yourselves. huh?

604
00:36:06.874 --> 00:36:10.169
RJ. just consider it.

605
00:36:28.979 --> 00:36:30.898
Hey. hey.

606
00:36:30.981 --> 00:36:32.441
Hi.

607
00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:36.320
I was. um. I was
in the neighborhood.

608
00:36:36.403 --> 00:36:39.281
Come in. come in. yeah.

609
00:36:40.908 --> 00:36:43.744
That's. uh.
I was about to take a break.

610
00:36:44.077 --> 00:36:47.164
so we need some glasses.

611
00:36:47.247 --> 00:36:48.332
I've only got these glasses

612
00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:49.583
but I'm sure
I can think of something.

613
00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:51.793
One second.

614
00:36:56.798 --> 00:36:57.925
Hm.

615
00:36:58.508 --> 00:36:59.801
How's the book going?

616
00:37:00.302 --> 00:37:01.470
- The book?
- Yeah.

617
00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:02.763
Uh. struggling.

618
00:37:03.889 --> 00:37:06.475
I'm guessing that's
a good thing. you know?

619
00:37:09.686 --> 00:37:10.687
Uh...

620
00:37:11.605 --> 00:37:12.856
This the guy you're writing
the book about?

621
00:37:13.565 --> 00:37:14.691
Yeah.

622
00:37:18.237 --> 00:37:19.446
Meyer Lansky?

623
00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.199
That's him. Here. sit down.

624
00:37:23.242 --> 00:37:24.451
Should I know who that is?

625
00:37:24.534 --> 00:37:27.162
Uh. he ran a lot of casinos.

626
00:37:27.246 --> 00:37:29.998
So. if you're into gambling.
I guess. but. um.

627
00:37:30.082 --> 00:37:31.750
Hey. I'm so sorry
about the mess.

628
00:37:31.833 --> 00:37:33.752
Oh stop. I don't care.

629
00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:40.509
That's my daughter.
She's really cheeky.

630
00:37:40.592 --> 00:37:41.885
- Oh.
- And looks a lot like me.

631
00:37:42.344 --> 00:37:44.972
Oh. she's pretty cute.

632
00:37:45.055 --> 00:37:48.934
Yeah. and I got a picture
of my son somewhere.

633
00:37:49.017 --> 00:37:51.478
but. uh. 18 months.

634
00:37:52.187 --> 00:37:53.730
He looks like a bug.

635
00:37:56.149 --> 00:37:59.194
But uh. here you go.
and don't worry. you know?

636
00:37:59.278 --> 00:38:00.696
- Yeah. I noticed.
- Yeah. okay.

637
00:38:05.575 --> 00:38:07.286
To your. uh.

638
00:38:08.328 --> 00:38:09.997
to a vacation in paradi--

639
00:38:15.252 --> 00:38:16.295
Sorry.

640
00:38:19.715 --> 00:38:21.049
You were saying?

641
00:38:24.011 --> 00:38:25.137
To umm...

642
00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:30.017
To vacation in paradise.
I guess.

643
00:38:38.859 --> 00:38:40.068
Hey. hey.

644
00:38:40.694 --> 00:38:42.237
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

645
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:54.624
Were you unfaithful
to your wife.

646
00:38:54.708 --> 00:38:56.918
is that why you broke up?

647
00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:02.132
Then what was it?

648
00:39:03.467 --> 00:39:05.177
I tried to give her
a good life

649
00:39:05.635 --> 00:39:07.888
and tried to make her happy.
but it wasn't enough.

650
00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:13.435
Happy on whose terms?
Yours or hers?

651
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:18.732
I was as unfaithful
as they come.

652
00:39:19.149 --> 00:39:22.569
The way I see it. you do
what you can and feel alive.

653
00:39:25.113 --> 00:39:27.991
It's time I told you about
the years leading up to the war.

654
00:39:30.827 --> 00:39:31.828
I thought you'd quit.

655
00:39:33.246 --> 00:39:35.248
I keep a pack as a reminder.

656
00:39:36.458 --> 00:39:38.668
You want to conquer
your weaknesses.

657
00:39:38.752 --> 00:39:40.337
keep them in plain sight.

658
00:39:42.547 --> 00:39:44.216
Speaking of which. how was she?

659
00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:46.676
Who?

660
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.887
You still have lipstick
on your neck.

661
00:39:50.389 --> 00:39:52.474
Don't you shower?
Jesus.

662
00:39:53.558 --> 00:39:56.853
So. Lucky was in jail.

663
00:39:56.937 --> 00:39:58.772
<i>I wanted to get him
out of prison.</i>

664
00:40:00.023 --> 00:40:02.567
How fast can we put together
an army of men?

665
00:40:02.651 --> 00:40:03.819
Fast.

666
00:40:04.444 --> 00:40:05.487
For what?

667
00:40:07.197 --> 00:40:08.990
I want to put the fear of God
into them.

668
00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:14.621
<i>- Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>- Heil</i> Hitler.

669
00:40:18.542 --> 00:40:21.169
We call upon our legislators
to evict to the fact that

670
00:40:21.253 --> 00:40:28.260
Jew is as alien in body.
mind. and soul.

671
00:40:29.177 --> 00:40:31.596
and is more dangerous to us
than all the others

672
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.099
by reason of its
parasitic nature.

673
00:40:34.933 --> 00:40:37.352
<i>- Heil</i> Hitler.
<i>- Heil</i> Hitler.

674
00:40:42.941 --> 00:40:44.526
This is a private function.

675
00:40:57.122 --> 00:40:58.832
My name is Sasha Klein.

676
00:40:59.541 --> 00:41:02.127
My parents come
from Ludmir. Poland.

677
00:41:03.295 --> 00:41:04.546
I'm Jew.

678
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.382
You got something
to say to me?

679
00:41:08.258 --> 00:41:09.509
Say it now.

680
00:41:09.593 --> 00:41:11.136
Jewish scum!

681
00:42:02.812 --> 00:42:04.856
I would rather
have killed them all.

682
00:42:06.191 --> 00:42:07.400
Why?

683
00:42:11.863 --> 00:42:16.993
To show the world that as long
as Meyer Lansky was around.

684
00:42:19.955 --> 00:42:22.082
they could never do that
to us again.

685
00:42:27.003 --> 00:42:28.255
Never.

686
00:42:32.342 --> 00:42:35.303
Rabbi Weiss calls the act
shameful and deplorable.

687
00:42:37.013 --> 00:42:38.598
The rabbi says
there is no difference

688
00:42:38.682 --> 00:42:41.268
between these so-called
Jewish gangsters

689
00:42:41.768 --> 00:42:43.937
and the Nazi hoodlums
they attacked.

690
00:42:49.985 --> 00:42:51.987
The grocer refuses to
take my money.

691
00:42:55.991 --> 00:42:57.867
People look away from me
and the kids

692
00:42:57.951 --> 00:42:59.578
when we walk down the sidewalk.

693
00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:04.749
Now they all know.

694
00:43:23.685 --> 00:43:24.686
Paul. come.

695
00:43:25.895 --> 00:43:27.063
Come.

696
00:43:29.441 --> 00:43:30.650
Buddy. you too.

697
00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:35.363
Leave your father alone.

698
00:43:36.364 --> 00:43:37.532
You have some thinking to do.

699
00:43:38.283 --> 00:43:39.367
Buddy.

700
00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:46.458
Listen to your mother.

701
00:44:05.727 --> 00:44:07.228
Mr. Lansky.

702
00:44:07.312 --> 00:44:09.105
I'm Lieutenant Haffenden
of the B3 division

703
00:44:09.189 --> 00:44:10.482
of Naval Intelligence.

704
00:44:11.441 --> 00:44:14.027
As I'm sure you know.
the Germans are sabotaging.

705
00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:16.279
and destroying our ships
all over the North Atlantic.

706
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.367
I've read the papers.
It's terrible.

707
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:23.078
The enemy is here on our shores.

708
00:44:23.411 --> 00:44:24.496
It's only
a matter of time before

709
00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:26.039
there's an attack
on our soil.

710
00:44:26.414 --> 00:44:28.124
We need to ferret out
German spies.

711
00:44:28.208 --> 00:44:30.502
Like you got a problem
with the Sicilians.

712
00:44:31.252 --> 00:44:34.631
Because the Sicilians got
a problem with people like you.

713
00:44:34.714 --> 00:44:35.799
the authorities.

714
00:44:35.882 --> 00:44:37.258
The Mafia controls
the waterfront.

715
00:44:37.342 --> 00:44:40.220
Are you suggesting that
I'm affiliated with the Mafia?

716
00:44:40.303 --> 00:44:42.639
I'm a businessman. Lieutenant.

717
00:44:42.722 --> 00:44:43.723
Of course.

718
00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:46.976
I'll find your spies.

719
00:44:48.186 --> 00:44:50.021
but you got to
do me a favor first.

720
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:08.998
Mr. Luciano. State Department
has agreed to arrange

721
00:45:09.082 --> 00:45:10.333
for your release from prison.

722
00:45:10.417 --> 00:45:13.086
24 years left
on my sentence.

723
00:45:14.421 --> 00:45:17.048
14 before I'm even eligible
for parole.

724
00:45:18.758 --> 00:45:20.051
Meyer.

725
00:45:21.136 --> 00:45:23.346
I know you would do the same
thing for me.

726
00:45:28.977 --> 00:45:30.270
What can I do to help?

727
00:45:32.856 --> 00:45:35.650
They need you to set up
a meeting with Joe Socks.

728
00:45:35.734 --> 00:45:36.985
Joe Socks?

729
00:45:37.068 --> 00:45:40.447
Joe Lanza. local 16975.

730
00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.991
United Seafood Workers Union.

731
00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:46.161
I'll arrange for your boys
to get their union cards

732
00:45:46.244 --> 00:45:47.912
and you can begin
your operation.

733
00:45:47.996 --> 00:45:51.124
I was the connection between
the US and the waterfront.

734
00:45:51.207 --> 00:45:53.668
There were German spies
working amongst us.

735
00:45:53.752 --> 00:45:56.421
I extracted whatever
intelligence I could from them

736
00:45:56.504 --> 00:45:58.173
on behalf of the feds.

737
00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:00.300
The fate of the country
depended on us.

738
00:46:00.383 --> 00:46:01.801
and they're looking
to lock me up?

739
00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:04.429
God bless America.

740
00:46:08.016 --> 00:46:09.476
<i>I had my men on the docks</i>

741
00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:11.853
<i>hunting Germans
up and down the shore.</i>

742
00:46:16.065 --> 00:46:18.193
<i>We'd root them out
and have ourselves</i>

743
00:46:18.276 --> 00:46:19.944
<i>a friendly conversation</i>

744
00:46:20.028 --> 00:46:21.529
<i>in the language
them cocksuckers</i>

745
00:46:21.613 --> 00:46:22.906
<i>understood only too well.</i>

746
00:46:27.869 --> 00:46:29.120
You got an address?

747
00:46:29.746 --> 00:46:31.372
224 Main Street.

748
00:46:40.548 --> 00:46:41.633
- Freeze. don't move.
- Get on the ground!

749
00:46:41.716 --> 00:46:42.801
- Now!
- Don't move.

750
00:46:42.884 --> 00:46:43.885
you're under arrest.

751
00:46:44.344 --> 00:46:45.428
<i>We busted up a whole</i>

752
00:46:45.512 --> 00:46:47.138
<i>German intelligence network.</i>

753
00:46:47.972 --> 00:46:49.933
<i>Blew the cover
on a group of spies</i>

754
00:46:50.016 --> 00:46:52.769
<i>moving artillery. bombs.
and cash.</i>

755
00:46:53.561 --> 00:46:56.356
<i>They were planning an enormous
attack on American soil.</i>

756
00:46:56.981 --> 00:46:58.817
<i>but we stopped them.</i>

757
00:46:59.901 --> 00:47:01.152
So. why would you defend
a country

758
00:47:01.236 --> 00:47:03.655
whose government is devoted
to putting you behind bars?

759
00:47:03.738 --> 00:47:06.032
I'm an American and a Jew.

760
00:47:06.574 --> 00:47:09.869
The Germans wanted to destroy
both of those things.

761
00:47:09.953 --> 00:47:12.622
So I wanted to destroy
the Germans.

762
00:47:12.705 --> 00:47:14.374
- And I did.
- Okay. But why?

763
00:47:14.457 --> 00:47:16.251
Why was it never
in the--in the press?

764
00:47:16.668 --> 00:47:19.546
They could never own up to
the fact that somebody like me

765
00:47:19.629 --> 00:47:22.340
could be capable of doing
any good in this world.

766
00:47:22.966 --> 00:47:26.052
See. I believe this world
is made of shades of gray.

767
00:47:26.135 --> 00:47:28.096
It's never black or white.

768
00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:31.015
So. you never felt compelled to
just set the record straight

769
00:47:31.099 --> 00:47:32.767
and say. Meyer Lansky. patriot?

770
00:47:33.268 --> 00:47:35.228
I think you found the title
of your book.

771
00:47:35.311 --> 00:47:37.605
I'm asking you the question.

772
00:47:37.689 --> 00:47:40.108
I never felt the need back then.

773
00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:41.276
Why?

774
00:47:41.359 --> 00:47:44.529
It was currency between me
and the United States.

775
00:47:45.363 --> 00:47:47.907
I assumed that if I did favors
for the government.

776
00:47:47.991 --> 00:47:49.701
they would always honor
my loyalty.

777
00:47:49.784 --> 00:47:50.952
Right. And did they?

778
00:47:51.035 --> 00:47:53.288
We haven't gotten to that part
of the story yet. David.

779
00:47:53.371 --> 00:47:56.165
- Okay.
- United States?

780
00:47:57.208 --> 00:47:59.127
They're not
who you think they are. David.

781
00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:02.589
Mm. You're the wandering Jew
just like Lucky said. right?

782
00:48:02.672 --> 00:48:04.883
That's me.
the outsider

783
00:48:05.592 --> 00:48:08.887
invited in from the cold
to warm my feet by the fire.

784
00:48:09.679 --> 00:48:11.306
and then sent on
my way again.

785
00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:12.473
Yeah.

786
00:48:15.184 --> 00:48:17.020
You know how that feels.
don't you?

787
00:48:17.979 --> 00:48:19.397
Wait. What?

788
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.274
To be an outsider.

789
00:48:21.357 --> 00:48:22.609
Your father didn't die. David.

790
00:48:22.692 --> 00:48:24.402
he walked out on you
and your family

791
00:48:24.485 --> 00:48:27.530
and you felt like an outsider
ever since in this world.

792
00:48:31.326 --> 00:48:32.410
Yeah.

793
00:48:34.245 --> 00:48:35.246
Look at us here.

794
00:48:35.788 --> 00:48:38.958
Couple of outsiders sitting here
in a diner.

795
00:48:47.634 --> 00:48:49.552
- Don't fucking lie to me.
- I swear on my life--

796
00:48:49.636 --> 00:48:51.179
- That's bullshit.
- No.

797
00:48:51.638 --> 00:48:54.057
Maureen. I am gonna ask you
one more fucking time.

798
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.476
- who fucking snitched?
- I don't fucking know.

799
00:48:56.559 --> 00:48:58.144
I swear on my fucking life.
I have no idea.

800
00:48:58.227 --> 00:48:59.312
- That's bullshit.
- You okay?

801
00:48:59.395 --> 00:49:00.480
- Who the fuck is this?
- We're just talking.

802
00:49:00.563 --> 00:49:01.648
- What's the problem?
- Don't fucking lie.

803
00:49:01.731 --> 00:49:02.815
- ...life. I have no idea.
- You're shaking.

804
00:49:02.899 --> 00:49:04.734
- I'm not shaking.
- Hey. Take a hike. pal.

805
00:49:04.817 --> 00:49:06.861
Everybody got a John fucking
Wayne here. huh?

806
00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.613
Let me ask you a question. John.

807
00:49:10.198 --> 00:49:12.200
- Are you fucking her?
- Jesus. Ray.

808
00:49:13.493 --> 00:49:14.577
I don't think it's any
of your business. buddy.

809
00:49:14.661 --> 00:49:16.496
I'll tell you
why it's my fucking business.

810
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.665
'cause she's got
a big fucking mouth.

811
00:49:18.748 --> 00:49:20.625
- Fuck you.
- And if I can't trust her.

812
00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:22.335
I can't trust any of her
fuck buddies either.

813
00:49:22.418 --> 00:49:23.920
Don't disrespect her. okay?

814
00:49:25.755 --> 00:49:27.090
You put your fucking
bag down. pal.

815
00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:29.008
Ray. please don't do this.

816
00:49:29.092 --> 00:49:30.301
Yeah. put your fucking bag--

817
00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:32.762
God dammit.

818
00:49:33.388 --> 00:49:34.931
You're a fucking asshole. Ray.

819
00:49:35.014 --> 00:49:37.266
It's your fucking warning.
Keep your mouth shut.

820
00:49:41.729 --> 00:49:43.856
He was busted for selling drugs.

821
00:49:44.607 --> 00:49:46.067
Someone set him up.

822
00:49:50.113 --> 00:49:52.240
I told a girlfriend of mine
I was in Miami

823
00:49:52.323 --> 00:49:53.825
and she told him where I was.

824
00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:58.997
So he showed up wanting to know
if I know who set him up.

825
00:50:01.082 --> 00:50:02.333
Do you?

826
00:50:04.585 --> 00:50:05.670
No.

827
00:50:07.213 --> 00:50:08.464
I promise.

828
00:50:10.967 --> 00:50:12.552
We all make mistakes.

829
00:50:13.803 --> 00:50:15.138
Ray was one of mine.

830
00:50:21.644 --> 00:50:23.980
Life is just full of
shades of gray.

831
00:50:42.123 --> 00:50:43.332
Okay.

832
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:45.918
All right.

833
00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:48.713
She likes it rough. huh?

834
00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.675
Who did that to you?

835
00:50:52.759 --> 00:50:53.843
It's nothing.

836
00:50:53.926 --> 00:50:55.136
Either you're gonna tell me
who did this

837
00:50:55.219 --> 00:50:56.471
or I'm going to find out.

838
00:50:58.139 --> 00:51:00.266
All right. well.

839
00:51:00.683 --> 00:51:02.393
okay. you know
the woman that I've been...

840
00:51:03.519 --> 00:51:05.646
Fucking?
I think that's the word for it.

841
00:51:07.065 --> 00:51:11.027
Yeah. okay. um. well. I had to
break up a fight between her

842
00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:13.738
and her ex.

843
00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:14.947
I see.

844
00:51:15.698 --> 00:51:19.702
Well. I wish you luck with all
your future sparring endeavors.

845
00:51:19.786 --> 00:51:21.871
- Thank you. thanks.
- My pleasure.

846
00:51:21.954 --> 00:51:23.831
Next time. hit him first.

847
00:51:23.915 --> 00:51:25.583
Always hit him first.

848
00:51:27.668 --> 00:51:30.630
Mr. Lansky.
you chose the losing side.

849
00:51:31.672 --> 00:51:32.924
I'm a businessman.

850
00:51:35.384 --> 00:51:37.053
We don't choose sides.

851
00:51:38.096 --> 00:51:39.555
We choose opportunities.

852
00:51:40.014 --> 00:51:42.100
Which is why I think
we can make a deal.

853
00:51:43.059 --> 00:51:45.019
<i>Salvatore Maranzano.</i>

854
00:51:45.103 --> 00:51:47.980
<i>boss of all bosses of
organized crime in New York.</i>

855
00:51:48.356 --> 00:51:50.900
<i>Bootlegging. racketeering.
narcotics.</i>

856
00:51:50.983 --> 00:51:52.819
<i>He called himself
Little Caesar.</i>

857
00:51:55.488 --> 00:51:57.281
I want to invest
in your copper joints.

858
00:51:57.949 --> 00:52:03.496
See. the thing is. I built
my business from the ground up

859
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:08.376
and I prefer to keep it under
the same roof.

860
00:52:11.546 --> 00:52:15.133
And frankly. Mr. Maranzano.
I don't need your money.

861
00:52:19.011 --> 00:52:22.473
Yeah. I don't give a shit.
How's that? Look.

862
00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:26.060
What if I offer you
an opportunity

863
00:52:26.144 --> 00:52:28.062
to take Luciano's seat
in the council?

864
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.982
How would you propose
doing that?

865
00:52:31.399 --> 00:52:34.193
You take Luciano out
and the seat's yours.

866
00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:36.487
He'll never see it coming
from you.

867
00:52:40.575 --> 00:52:41.617
You walk out now

868
00:52:42.243 --> 00:52:44.078
or we pinch you and take you
down with the rest of 'em.

869
00:52:49.083 --> 00:52:52.920
I have known Luciano
for a long time.

870
00:52:54.672 --> 00:52:55.965
since we were children.

871
00:52:57.925 --> 00:53:00.303
He's much more than an associate
to me.

872
00:53:00.386 --> 00:53:01.637
I respect that.

873
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:05.892
But there can only be one boss.
and that's me.

874
00:53:06.642 --> 00:53:07.935
It's about business.

875
00:53:08.895 --> 00:53:10.605
I think you should make
the right decision here

876
00:53:10.938 --> 00:53:12.440
and do the right thing.

877
00:53:12.523 --> 00:53:13.816
We got a search warrant.

878
00:53:14.817 --> 00:53:16.152
Hey. nobody move.

879
00:53:16.235 --> 00:53:17.486
Nobody move! Hey!

880
00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:18.696
What's all the commotion?

881
00:53:18.779 --> 00:53:20.114
Go check it out. Marco.

882
00:53:22.867 --> 00:53:26.704
Woah. woah. woah. calm down.
Put down your guns.

883
00:53:27.163 --> 00:53:28.915
My boss is inside.
you go talk to him.

884
00:53:29.457 --> 00:53:30.750
He knows your Captain.
It's going to be okay.

885
00:53:30.833 --> 00:53:33.044
Everything's all right.
Hey.

886
00:53:37.423 --> 00:53:39.592
What took you so long?

887
00:53:39.675 --> 00:53:40.801
Lot of stairs.

888
00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:44.055
Double-crossing prick.

889
00:53:44.889 --> 00:53:45.973
Make him feel it. Benny.

890
00:53:46.057 --> 00:53:47.433
No. No.

891
00:53:47.516 --> 00:53:48.601
- Come here.
- No.

892
00:53:52.438 --> 00:53:54.232
Look at me. look at me
when you fucking die.

893
00:53:54.315 --> 00:53:56.359
you double-crossing
sack of shit.

894
00:53:59.695 --> 00:54:01.280
Oh. that's it.

895
00:54:03.574 --> 00:54:04.575
Here you go.

896
00:54:13.167 --> 00:54:14.794
They're gonna come after us now.

897
00:54:16.379 --> 00:54:18.339
All of them.
with everything they got.

898
00:54:18.422 --> 00:54:20.174
We'll already be in control
by then.

899
00:54:21.717 --> 00:54:23.552
I'm grateful for your loyalty.
Meyer.

900
00:54:26.764 --> 00:54:28.808
I want a seat at the council.
Charlie.

901
00:54:29.392 --> 00:54:30.726
It's a new era.

902
00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:32.728
what matters is
how I run my business.

903
00:54:32.812 --> 00:54:34.438
not the fact that I'm a Jew.

904
00:54:34.522 --> 00:54:35.898
You know. if it were up to me--

905
00:54:35.982 --> 00:54:37.400
We'll be your executors.

906
00:54:37.942 --> 00:54:39.777
You seen the numbers
we're doing in Saratoga.

907
00:54:40.194 --> 00:54:42.613
No one runs an operation
like I do.

908
00:54:42.697 --> 00:54:47.410
I got the best carpet joints.
Upstate. Jersey. Florida.

909
00:54:47.493 --> 00:54:49.578
No. you don't gotta justify it
to me. Meyer.

910
00:54:49.662 --> 00:54:51.872
Plus. I got the muscle to back
all of 'em.

911
00:54:51.956 --> 00:54:55.293
And the revenue.
the revenue speaks for itself.

912
00:54:56.252 --> 00:55:01.632
I run it like a business.
Like Ford Motors. Coca-Cola.

913
00:55:02.675 --> 00:55:04.927
You know. like US Steel.

914
00:55:08.889 --> 00:55:10.141
I'll tell you what.

915
00:55:12.351 --> 00:55:14.145
I'll do what I can
to convince the council

916
00:55:14.228 --> 00:55:15.604
that you deserve a spot.

917
00:55:15.688 --> 00:55:16.731
Hmm.

918
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:19.859
What about Benny?

919
00:55:19.942 --> 00:55:20.943
Benny.

920
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:24.488
Benny's handling California
for us.

921
00:55:31.787 --> 00:55:33.205
Why are you still awake?

922
00:55:33.289 --> 00:55:34.874
How the hell
am I supposed to sleep?

923
00:55:35.833 --> 00:55:37.126
Do you know what time it is?

924
00:55:37.209 --> 00:55:39.086
Yeah. says the man who comes
and goes at all hours.

925
00:55:39.545 --> 00:55:40.880
Mind your business.

926
00:55:41.714 --> 00:55:42.715
Was out working.

927
00:55:43.174 --> 00:55:44.383
Work.

928
00:55:44.842 --> 00:55:46.093
It's always work with you.

929
00:55:46.177 --> 00:55:48.012
Take a look around you.

930
00:55:48.888 --> 00:55:51.223
All this shit.

931
00:55:51.307 --> 00:55:53.225
Where do you think
it comes from. huh?

932
00:55:53.934 --> 00:55:56.103
Maybe try showing
a little gratitude for once.

933
00:55:57.021 --> 00:55:58.105
Gratitude?

934
00:55:59.357 --> 00:56:01.275
The hell with gratitude.
you're a criminal.

935
00:56:13.621 --> 00:56:14.622
What happened to you?

936
00:56:16.332 --> 00:56:17.333
You're pathetic.

937
00:56:21.462 --> 00:56:24.173
You think the neighbors
don't talk to you because of me?

938
00:56:25.508 --> 00:56:27.551
I see in your eyes
what you do at night.

939
00:56:28.427 --> 00:56:31.639
Who do you think you are
coming into our home

940
00:56:32.014 --> 00:56:33.974
pretending to be a good man.
huh?

941
00:56:34.058 --> 00:56:35.101
A father?

942
00:56:36.143 --> 00:56:37.686
You think you're helping him!

943
00:56:38.687 --> 00:56:40.731
Shut your mouth!

944
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:43.484
It's your fault.

945
00:56:44.276 --> 00:56:46.737
It's your fault he's a cripple.

946
00:56:46.821 --> 00:56:49.323
It's because of you.
it's all because of you!

947
00:56:53.702 --> 00:56:55.287
It's called "judgement."

948
00:56:55.788 --> 00:56:58.165
It's punishment
for what you've done

949
00:56:58.249 --> 00:57:00.543
and how you live your life.
Meyer.

950
00:57:08.342 --> 00:57:09.468
God is watching.

951
00:57:09.552 --> 00:57:12.972
He's watching.
he's watching you. I know he is.

952
00:57:25.734 --> 00:57:26.819
You believe that?

953
00:57:28.195 --> 00:57:29.363
Believe what?

954
00:57:29.447 --> 00:57:33.784
We get judged and punished
for the way we live our lives.

955
00:57:34.368 --> 00:57:37.788
The choices we make.
that's what defines us.

956
00:57:38.664 --> 00:57:40.875
I don't question
the choices I make.

957
00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:42.042
Never?

958
00:57:42.126 --> 00:57:44.253
I get the feeling sometimes
you don't question

959
00:57:44.336 --> 00:57:45.963
the choices you make either.

960
00:57:46.755 --> 00:57:48.674
Okay. let's talk
about those choices.

961
00:57:50.759 --> 00:57:52.678
Tell me about Murder. Inc.

962
00:57:52.761 --> 00:57:54.346
After Maranzano.

963
00:57:54.889 --> 00:57:57.808
we needed the muscle
to consolidate our power.

964
00:57:58.601 --> 00:58:00.603
I had the right people to do it.

965
00:58:02.688 --> 00:58:03.731
Bingo.

966
00:58:05.774 --> 00:58:06.942
<i>A group of nice Jewish</i>

967
00:58:07.026 --> 00:58:08.402
<i>and Italian boys.</i>

968
00:58:08.777 --> 00:58:10.279
<i>you know. the kind a girl
wants to bring home</i>

969
00:58:10.362 --> 00:58:11.363
<i>to her mother.</i>

970
00:58:11.822 --> 00:58:13.866
<i>Always willing to lend a hand.</i>

971
00:58:16.827 --> 00:58:17.995
<i>"Murder. Inc."</i>

972
00:58:18.579 --> 00:58:19.955
<i>That's what they called them.</i>

973
00:58:20.748 --> 00:58:22.458
<i>There was
Abe "Kid Twist" Reles.</i>

974
00:58:22.541 --> 00:58:24.168
<i>"Tick-Tock" Tannenbaum.</i>

975
00:58:24.668 --> 00:58:28.506
<i>Louis "Lepke" Buchalter.

976
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:31.717
<i>hired assassins.
a thousand hits between 'em.</i>

977
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.594
<i>they put contract killers
on payroll.</i>

978
00:58:34.803 --> 00:58:36.555
<i>There were no rules
on how to kill.</i>

979
00:58:36.639 --> 00:58:38.891
<i>As long as you got it done.
you got paid.</i>

980
00:58:40.893 --> 00:58:44.647
<i>Most were shot. stabbed.
strangled. drowned. burned.</i>

981
00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:47.066
<i>buried alive.

982
00:58:47.525 --> 00:58:49.401
<i>all of 'em unrepentant.</i>

983
00:58:49.485 --> 00:58:50.819
<i>cold-blooded killers.</i>

984
00:58:51.946 --> 00:58:53.531
<i>And Lansky was their general.</i>

985
00:58:54.698 --> 00:58:57.493
<i>Through sheer determination
and fearlessness.</i>

986
00:58:57.576 --> 00:58:59.495
<i>Lansky finally got
what he wanted.</i>

987
00:59:00.079 --> 00:59:02.665

00:59:08.712 --> 00:59:09.838
<i>...Jewish and Irish mob bosses</i>

991
00:59:09.922 --> 00:59:11.257
<i>from across America.</i>

992
00:59:11.799 --> 00:59:13.884

00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:32.820
I don't understand.

996
00:59:33.237 --> 00:59:34.321
When they were
investigating Lansky.

997
00:59:34.405 --> 00:59:36.282
no one bothered to look
at the old files?

998
00:59:36.782 --> 00:59:39.868
Hey. we're talking 40 years
of transcripts. depositions.

999
00:59:39.952 --> 00:59:41.495
surveillance reports.

1000
00:59:41.912 --> 00:59:43.706
That's a lot of material.

1001
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:45.791
Frank. look at this.

1002
00:59:47.042 --> 00:59:48.335
It says he's still alive.

1003
00:59:51.547 --> 00:59:56.051
Mr. Sims. I'm Special Agent
Frank Rivers with the FBI.

1004
00:59:59.805 --> 01:00:02.224
I'd like to talk to you
about your association

1005
01:00:02.308 --> 01:00:03.475
with Meyer Lansky.

1006
01:00:03.559 --> 01:00:04.977
Never heard of him.

1007
01:00:06.061 --> 01:00:08.772
I can make your life in here
a whole lot easier. you know.

1008
01:00:08.856 --> 01:00:10.316
I'm gonna die in here.

1009
01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:12.276
The hell are you gonna do
for me?

1010
01:00:12.735 --> 01:00:14.111
Get me fresh soup?

1011
01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:17.072
Well. Lansky sent you on a job
and you got caught

1012
01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:19.366
and right now he's. uh...

1013
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.119
he's having
a pretty comfortable life.

1014
01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:23.537
and you're stuck in here.

1015
01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:25.497
You gonna pop him for me.
are you?

1016
01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:26.790
I can put him away.

1017
01:00:26.874 --> 01:00:28.876
Make it so his life's
not a whole lot different

1018
01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:29.960
from yours.

1019
01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:32.921
I'm looking for his money.

1020
01:00:33.005 --> 01:00:35.966
He started stashing it away
back in the Murder. Inc. Days.

1021
01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.760
So who was keeping the books
back then?

1022
01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:40.346
- No money.
- What do you mean. "no money"?

1023
01:00:40.429 --> 01:00:42.306
There's no money in murder.

1024
01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:48.145
It wasn't a sustainable
business. not like a casino.

1025
01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:50.648
There was money. Maybe he just
didn't tell you about it.

1026
01:00:51.023 --> 01:00:52.816
He was stuffing the walls
with it.

1027
01:00:57.363 --> 01:00:59.198
Then go ask the walls.

1028
01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:01.575
You listen to me.
you piece of shit.

1029
01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:05.871
The only reason you're in here
is because of that asshole.

1030
01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:09.041
Well. now you can suffer
the rest of your time in here

1031
01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:10.292
because of him. too.

1032
01:01:12.211 --> 01:01:13.212
Geneva.

1033
01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:15.714
Geneva?

1034
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:20.135
He had a money manager
in Geneva.

1035
01:01:42.658 --> 01:01:43.659
What are you doing with that?

1036
01:01:48.831 --> 01:01:49.832
What are you doing with it?

1037
01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:55.546
FBI.

1038
01:01:59.258 --> 01:02:01.260
Just tell--
Just tell me. tell me.

1039
01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:02.553
Tell me. it's okay.

1040
01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:03.762
What--what is it?

1041
01:02:04.138 --> 01:02:05.764
Ray turned state's evidence.

1042
01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:08.642
he made a deal with the Feds.
they reduced his sentence.

1043
01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:10.352
And he named me
as one of his partners

1044
01:02:10.436 --> 01:02:11.520
in his drug operation.

1045
01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:13.355
So the Feds came to me
and they said that

1046
01:02:13.439 --> 01:02:15.566
I would go to prison
if I didn't cooperate.

1047
01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:16.650
Okay.

1048
01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:18.485
So...

1049
01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:20.404
So. how?

1050
01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:21.697
To "cooperate."
that's the word that they used?

1051
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.031
Get close to you.

1052
01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:28.412
Okay. and then?

1053
01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:31.415
Feed them information
from your files.

1054
01:02:34.835 --> 01:02:36.503
Listen. David.

1055
01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:39.715
everything that's been
happening between us is real.

1056
01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:43.051
- You have to trust me.
- Trust you. trust you?

1057
01:02:43.135 --> 01:02:45.345
- I know that sounds ridiculous.
- I have a family.

1058
01:02:55.022 --> 01:02:57.608
What did--did you...

1059
01:02:58.442 --> 01:03:00.861
- What'd you give 'em?
- Everything I could remember.

1060
01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:05.574
The name of associates
and accomplices.

1061
01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:08.494
They wanted me to write
everything down

1062
01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:10.162
and give it to them
and that's what I did.

1063
01:03:10.245 --> 01:03:12.039
Okay. what else did they want?

1064
01:03:12.623 --> 01:03:14.750
What else they want
apart from names?

1065
01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.502
They said you might have
information on money

1066
01:03:16.585 --> 01:03:18.128
that Lansky laundered years ago.

1067
01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:19.505
Money.

1068
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:33.143
Oh.

1069
01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.496
<i>What are you doing with that?</i>

1070
01:04:35.122 --> 01:04:37.583
<i>What are you doing with it?</i>

1071
01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:40.669
<i>FBI.</i>

1072
01:04:42.588 --> 01:04:43.755
<i>I'll tell you everything.</i>

1073
01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.083
Okay. here we are again.

1074
01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:43.231
- Morning.
- Can I help you?

1075
01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:46.652
Special Agent Frank Rivers.
with the FBI.

1076
01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:49.321
We're looking for a guest
of the hotel. Miss Duffy.

1077
01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:51.365
She's in room 1-4-6.

1078
01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:52.824
Miss Duffy's not here.

1079
01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:55.077
Well. I'd like to look
in her room if I could.

1080
01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.328
Suit yourself.

1081
01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:57.913
But you're not going to find
anything there.

1082
01:05:58.497 --> 01:06:00.749
- Room's empty.
- Empty?

1083
01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:02.626
Miss Duffy checked out
late last night.

1084
01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:08.465
How did you evade the Feds?

1085
01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:10.676
Like how did you
and your business associates

1086
01:06:10.759 --> 01:06:13.261
become so successful under
the scrutiny of the government?

1087
01:06:13.762 --> 01:06:16.056
- Why are you whispering?
- Hmm?

1088
01:06:16.515 --> 01:06:17.724
I can hardly hear you.

1089
01:06:19.351 --> 01:06:21.937
How did you and
your associates...

1090
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.272
like. got very--very successful

1091
01:06:24.356 --> 01:06:25.649
under the scrutiny
of the government.

1092
01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:26.733
How did you do that?

1093
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:29.486
The way any legitimate
company does.

1094
01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:33.490
We were making more money
than some Fortune 500 companies.

1095
01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:36.702
We got assets to manage
and we had the best talent

1096
01:06:36.785 --> 01:06:38.161
to manage them.

1097
01:06:38.245 --> 01:06:39.413
You okay. David?

1098
01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:41.957
You seem a little white
around the gills this morning.

1099
01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:43.834
It was one of those nights.

1100
01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:46.878
Not another one.

1101
01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:50.590
Okay. so um. how'd you go about
doing all of that.

1102
01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.551
changing your
business practices?

1103
01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:54.553
'Cause I think that's what
everyone wants to know.

1104
01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:57.681
I taught my associates that
there are benefits.

1105
01:06:57.764 --> 01:07:02.269
cost benefits of keeping a guy
that owes you money alive.

1106
01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:05.647
Instead of goons. I said.
we ought to send accountants.

1107
01:07:06.148 --> 01:07:09.901
Additional sum for
the cash reserve and profit

1108
01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:13.613
should be passed along
to be put in the credit column

1109
01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:15.449
of the ledger.

1110
01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.075
There's a reason
I dropped out of school

1111
01:07:17.159 --> 01:07:18.493
when I was 12.

1112
01:07:18.577 --> 01:07:20.662
That guy made more money

1113
01:07:20.746 --> 01:07:22.247
for Luciano
than all your twits combined.

1114
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:23.498
Come on.

1115
01:07:23.582 --> 01:07:24.666
Any questions?

1116
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:27.294
In the early days.
a man owed you money.

1117
01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:29.713
you would send goons
to break his body apart.

1118
01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:33.633
<i>and if he couldn't pay.
he'd find an unfortunate end.</i>

1119
01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:36.470
Now. rather than kill the guy.
we audit him.

1120
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.096
<i>crunch the numbers.</i>

1121
01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.599
<i>make sure his business
turns a profit.</i>

1122
01:07:41.058 --> 01:07:43.643
Now. Joe Schmo belongs to us.

1123
01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:45.729
We own him.

1124
01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:56.448
Why don't we go for a walk.
David?

1125
01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:58.241
You look like
you could use some air.

1126
01:07:58.909 --> 01:08:00.077
Come.

1127
01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:08.376
Optimizing our resources.
restructuring our operations.

1128
01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:11.129
This was a new world
for our associates.

1129
01:08:11.213 --> 01:08:13.006
I think it was Henry Ford
that said that.

1130
01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:16.259
"Business that makes nothing
but money is a poor business."

1131
01:08:16.635 --> 01:08:19.346
Gambling and casinos
are to entertainment.

1132
01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:22.140
what Ford's automobile
was to transportation.

1133
01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:25.519
For some. there's no such thrill
as the toss of the dice.

1134
01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:26.978
We catered to that need.

1135
01:08:27.062 --> 01:08:29.147
Okay. you wake up
in the morning.

1136
01:08:29.231 --> 01:08:30.398
there's car in your driveway.

1137
01:08:30.982 --> 01:08:32.317
You didn't make a product.

1138
01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:37.114
Henry Ford's product
wasn't the car.

1139
01:08:37.531 --> 01:08:39.908
It was the freedom
the car gave to people.

1140
01:08:40.784 --> 01:08:42.452
Freedom is what people wanted.

1141
01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.831
Our product wasn't gambling
or the casinos.

1142
01:08:45.914 --> 01:08:48.375
It was the world of excitement
and thrills.

1143
01:08:48.458 --> 01:08:50.293
We built half the resorts
in this country.

1144
01:08:50.377 --> 01:08:53.880
created thousands of jobs.
supported families.

1145
01:08:54.422 --> 01:08:55.465
It was a product.

1146
01:08:56.216 --> 01:08:57.676
That's why
it's all legalized now.

1147
01:08:57.759 --> 01:08:59.511
why the government
has its finger in the pie.

1148
01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:03.515
It was too valuable a product
to leave to criminals.

1149
01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:16.319
- David. where's your car?
- It's over there.

1150
01:09:20.157 --> 01:09:22.409
This fucker is following us.

1151
01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:23.952
Can you fucking believe it?

1152
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:28.081
See if you could turn off
some place.

1153
01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:30.584
make the first turnoff you can.

1154
01:09:34.546 --> 01:09:36.131
- Here?
- Right over here.

1155
01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.427
Son of a bitch.

1156
01:09:59.196 --> 01:10:01.114
Right. so who is that?

1157
01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:05.118
I thought maybe
you could tell me.

1158
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:08.747
I--I don't know.

1159
01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:21.885
When you lose your money.
you lose nothing.

1160
01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:24.763
When you lose your health.
you lose something.

1161
01:10:25.347 --> 01:10:28.475
When you lose your character.
you lose everything.

1162
01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:31.853
Remember that.

1163
01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:15.021
Hey. woman in the room.
you seen her?

1164
01:11:15.105 --> 01:11:16.106
She checked out.

1165
01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.150
- She checked out?
- What's going on here?

1166
01:11:19.234 --> 01:11:20.485
I don't want any trouble.

1167
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.822
I'm not giving you any trouble.

1168
01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:26.825
The Do Not Disturb sign has been
on your door for a week.

1169
01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:29.828
Okay. well. let's keep it
that way. all right?

1170
01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:31.454
I'll pay you extra.
you let no one in my room.

1171
01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:33.915
Fine.

1172
01:11:54.185 --> 01:11:57.439
Let's talk about the shitstorm
of trouble you're in. Mr. Stone.

1173
01:11:57.522 --> 01:11:58.857
Show him the pictures. Greg.

1174
01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.068
This must have been fun. huh?

1175
01:12:02.152 --> 01:12:03.236
Get a little taste of that.

1176
01:12:04.571 --> 01:12:06.197
- Meyer Lansky has--
- You have fun taking these?

1177
01:12:06.281 --> 01:12:07.741
- Did you have fun taking them?
- ...over 300 million dollars--

1178
01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:09.075
Why are you show--
Why are showing me this?

1179
01:12:09.159 --> 01:12:10.410
Listen to me. Lansky has

1180
01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:13.204
over 300 million dollars
squirreled away somewhere.

1181
01:12:13.288 --> 01:12:15.707
The government wants it and
we want your help finding it.

1182
01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:18.710
I can't. I can't--I...

1183
01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:21.171
And we could let it slip
to Mr. Lansky

1184
01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:24.424
that you've been sharing his
secrets with an FBI informant.

1185
01:12:25.175 --> 01:12:26.843
That's not gonna go well
for you.

1186
01:12:27.344 --> 01:12:30.513
Look. we don't wanna go down
that road if we don't have to.

1187
01:12:31.181 --> 01:12:33.475
We know you're just a writer
who was looking for a story

1188
01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:35.018
who had the misfortune
to stumble into

1189
01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:38.563
a decades-long investigation
into Lansky and Associates.

1190
01:12:39.064 --> 01:12:42.734
So we're willing to offer you
a financial incentive.

1191
01:12:43.193 --> 01:12:44.736
We'll make you a paid informant.

1192
01:12:45.487 --> 01:12:47.739
We'll give you 150.000 dollars.

1193
01:12:47.822 --> 01:12:49.699
Now that'll go a long way
to take care of your family

1194
01:12:49.783 --> 01:12:50.867
- and your money problems.
- I don't have any--

1195
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:53.620
- I don't need your money.
- David. we've been listening.

1196
01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:56.539
You help us
or Lansky gets to you first.

1197
01:12:56.623 --> 01:12:59.042
Now we can offer you
and your family protection

1198
01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.126
and the money.

1199
01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:02.379
The way I see it.
you don't have a choice.

1200
01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:04.714
I'm gonna give you
my number here.

1201
01:13:05.173 --> 01:13:07.675
You call us from a payphone
when you got something.

1202
01:13:10.095 --> 01:13:11.471
Do the right thing here. David.

1203
01:13:31.533 --> 01:13:34.327
You heard the joke about
this rabbi who got hit by a car.

1204
01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:36.830
falls down.
the emergency ambulance comes.

1205
01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:40.083
rabbi's laying on the floor.
the emergency worker runs over.

1206
01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:42.752
says. "Rabbi. Rabbi.
are you okay?"

1207
01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:46.089
The rabbi looks up at him
and he says. "I make a living."

1208
01:13:49.551 --> 01:13:50.635
Okay. go ahead.

1209
01:13:50.718 --> 01:13:52.053
A little levity here.
you know.

1210
01:13:52.679 --> 01:13:55.432
Money. Must have been pouring in
by now. right?

1211
01:13:57.267 --> 01:13:58.268
That's right.

1212
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:04.649
<i>The gaming business in Cuba</i>

1213
01:14:04.732 --> 01:14:05.775
<i>is no good.</i>

1214
01:14:06.818 --> 01:14:09.028
<i>it's a free-for-all.
no regulations.</i>

1215
01:14:12.991 --> 01:14:14.868
These men are making millions.

1216
01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:19.831
Gambling in Cuba will soon be
under our control again.

1217
01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:23.376
And President Batista
wants you to oversee it.

1218
01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.752
Mr. Lansky.

1219
01:14:24.836 --> 01:14:26.171
All of it.

1220
01:14:27.547 --> 01:14:29.591
I appreciate the opportunity.

1221
01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:34.637
I've always felt Cuba
is a land of enterprise.

1222
01:14:36.306 --> 01:14:38.433
In America.
you might be an outlaw.

1223
01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:42.103
but in Cuba
you are on the inside.

1224
01:14:51.446 --> 01:14:52.947
You were making what.
10 million?

1225
01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:57.076
Turned to 20.
and then 30 million.

1226
01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.828
I was the biggest
casino operator

1227
01:14:58.912 --> 01:15:00.788
this country had ever seen.

1228
01:15:00.872 --> 01:15:03.333
You were legitimate. yeah?
You were above board.

1229
01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:06.127
You had your license.
machines weren't rigged.

1230
01:15:06.211 --> 01:15:07.337
Never.

1231
01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.714
But they still consider you
part of the underworld.

1232
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:14.052
We weren't the underworld.

1233
01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:16.846
We were the overworld.

1234
01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:28.191
Go back to sleep.

1235
01:15:34.364 --> 01:15:35.907
<i>When Batista gave Lansky</i>

1236
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:37.825
<i>control over Cuba's casinos.</i>

1237
01:15:37.909 --> 01:15:40.411
<i>Lansky turned the country into
an international playground</i>

1238
01:15:40.495 --> 01:15:42.372
<i>for gamblers
and pleasure-seekers.</i>

1239
01:15:42.956 --> 01:15:45.291
<i>Criminal empire
outside the US.</i>

1240
01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:47.210
<i>it couldn't be touched
by law enforcement.</i>

1241
01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.712
<i>The National Crime Syndicate
now owned</i>

1242
01:15:49.796 --> 01:15:52.131
<i>the biggest gambling
corporation in the world.</i>

1243
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:54.384
<i>And Lansky was the CEO.</i>

1244
01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:02.976
How you doin'. huh?

1245
01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:05.937
How was the trip?

1246
01:16:06.688 --> 01:16:07.689
Fine.

1247
01:16:10.692 --> 01:16:12.026
How you doin'. beautiful?

1248
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:13.278
Huh?

1249
01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:14.445
Come on. let's go.

1250
01:16:14.529 --> 01:16:16.531
You wanna go to the room?

1251
01:16:16.614 --> 01:16:17.699
Come on.

1252
01:16:52.734 --> 01:16:54.193
You put the nickel in.

1253
01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:55.653
Just try.

1254
01:16:55.987 --> 01:16:57.071
Right here?

1255
01:16:59.032 --> 01:17:00.325
Pull that lever. hard.

1256
01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:07.123
State-of-the-art slot and blend.
Silent bells. double jackpots.

1257
01:17:07.665 --> 01:17:10.710
and we'll have the guys rig 'em
so they better our odds.

1258
01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:12.420
Didn't Ben talk to you
about that?

1259
01:17:12.503 --> 01:17:13.630
About what?

1260
01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:17.300
I don't want
the machines rigged.

1261
01:17:17.759 --> 01:17:20.053
Every casino in this town
rigs their machines.

1262
01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:22.805
I'm not every casino.

1263
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:25.391
Yes. sir.

1264
01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:30.355
Come on. go again.

1265
01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:39.781
I'll be right back. Buddy.

1266
01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:41.741
Keep at it.

1267
01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:43.409
You. watch the kid.

1268
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.468
Mr. Yariv. sir.

1269
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:03.304
Mr. Lansky.
thank you for seeing me.

1270
01:18:03.388 --> 01:18:05.473
Welcome to the Colonial.
Mr. Yariv.

1271
01:18:06.808 --> 01:18:07.934
Please.

1272
01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:09.769
Thank you.

1273
01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:11.938
How can I help you?

1274
01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:15.983
Mr. Lansky. I'm here on behalf
of Golda Meir.

1275
01:18:16.484 --> 01:18:19.112
As you know. our people
have been slaughtered in Germany

1276
01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:20.321
and across Europe.

1277
01:18:20.405 --> 01:18:22.949
The Jewish settlement in
Palestine has been hard at work.

1278
01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:24.909
- You need money?
- Yes.

1279
01:18:25.493 --> 01:18:26.786
To purchase weapons.

1280
01:18:27.704 --> 01:18:29.497
We are fighting for
the future state of Israel

1281
01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.250
and for the survival of
the Jewish people. Mr. Lansky.

1282
01:18:32.333 --> 01:18:35.670
Fighting. as in killing.

1283
01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:47.098
We will do whatever it takes.
Mr. Lansky.

1284
01:18:50.017 --> 01:18:52.270
You tell Miss Meir

1285
01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.481
that she has
Meyer Lansky's support.

1286
01:18:56.899 --> 01:18:59.235
I'd be happy to contribute
in any way.

1287
01:18:59.861 --> 01:19:03.072
And I'm sure my colleagues here
share my feelings

1288
01:19:03.156 --> 01:19:04.198
for the state of Israel.

1289
01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:08.035
Moe. how much do you have
on you?

1290
01:19:09.162 --> 01:19:10.496
It's the weekend take.

1291
01:19:11.998 --> 01:19:13.332
Give it to him.

1292
01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:26.512
Mr. Yariv here
is taking donations

1293
01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:28.389
for the state of Israel.

1294
01:19:28.473 --> 01:19:29.599
I am Italian.

1295
01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:54.791
I'll make arrangements for more.

1296
01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:58.211
On behalf of Golda Meir
and the Israeli people.

1297
01:19:58.294 --> 01:19:59.504
we are grateful.

1298
01:20:00.171 --> 01:20:01.756
And we will not soon forget.

1299
01:20:13.017 --> 01:20:15.019
If you need any weapons
or ammunition.

1300
01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.562
you let me know.

1301
01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:18.815
We hope you enjoy your stay
with us.

1302
01:20:18.898 --> 01:20:20.858
Oh. I'm not staying
at the Colonial.

1303
01:20:22.819 --> 01:20:24.654
Next time. I hope.

1304
01:20:39.919 --> 01:20:42.505
We're hearing things. Meyer.
about Benny.

1305
01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:45.550
What kind of things?

1306
01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:48.803
That he's out of control.
kicking heads in.

1307
01:20:48.886 --> 01:20:50.221
dating movie stars.

1308
01:20:51.222 --> 01:20:52.765
He's lost his focus. Meyer.

1309
01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:56.269
We gave him California.
we gave him Vegas.

1310
01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:58.312
all's we get in return is grief.

1311
01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:00.481
I'll talk to him.

1312
01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:03.067
Envelopes are coming back
light. too.

1313
01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:07.446
Listen.
Lucky ain't happy. Meyer.

1314
01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:12.410
Okay? You know. it ain't easy
for us coming to you like this.

1315
01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:15.663
. Ben.

1316
01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:20.126
I said... I'll talk to him.

1317
01:21:32.847 --> 01:21:36.726
So. what are you gonna
do with your winnings. huh?

1318
01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:41.230
Buy Mom a new fur coat.
just like you always do.

1319
01:21:41.314 --> 01:21:42.398
Your mother--
Your mother. she's got

1320
01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:43.900
plenty of fur coats.

1321
01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:46.944
I'm gonna be just like you.

1322
01:21:48.154 --> 01:21:50.615
I'm gonna get my wife
fur coats. too.

1323
01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:58.039
Well. you can be whatever
you wanna be.

1324
01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:02.585
You don't wanna be like me.

1325
01:22:11.052 --> 01:22:12.345
Why?

1326
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:17.808
You just don't.

1327
01:22:28.194 --> 01:22:31.405
I love you. you know that.
right?

1328
01:22:33.324 --> 01:22:34.825
I love you. too.

1329
01:22:48.965 --> 01:22:52.093
I never wanted my children
to follow in my footsteps.

1330
01:22:53.052 --> 01:22:54.720
You know. I think about it
all the time.

1331
01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:03.020
Do my kids see me as a...
man who tries his best

1332
01:23:03.104 --> 01:23:04.814
or... or as a failure?

1333
01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:07.274
It's complicated.

1334
01:23:08.109 --> 01:23:11.070
Marriage. children.
you did your best.

1335
01:23:13.364 --> 01:23:14.740
I trust you. David.

1336
01:23:15.241 --> 01:23:16.826
You're gonna write
a hell of a book.

1337
01:23:23.916 --> 01:23:25.251
Vegas.

1338
01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:27.962
Vegas. Flamingo.

1339
01:23:29.547 --> 01:23:32.633
<i>We built
that town. a paradise.</i>

1340
01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:36.387
<i>but for us it turned out to be
our worst nightmare.</i>

1341
01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:56.866
- Yeah.
- Benny.

1342
01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:58.534
<i>Meyer. that you?</i>

1343
01:24:01.162 --> 01:24:02.246
What time is it?

1344
01:24:02.329 --> 01:24:04.373
It's a quarter after two there.

1345
01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:06.125
Look. why don't you
hop on a flight

1346
01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:07.209
and head out here?

1347
01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:10.129
Oh. hey pal. listen.
I'd love to.

1348
01:24:10.212 --> 01:24:11.922
but you know. Ginny's
got friends in town. right?

1349
01:24:12.006 --> 01:24:14.508
So. probably not for me.

1350
01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:19.972
Hey. I gotta tell you.
the women in this town. man.

1351
01:24:21.474 --> 01:24:22.600
Meyer. you'd go crazy.

1352
01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.019
I'm happy things are good
for you. Ben.

1353
01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:27.480
but unfortunately.
we have to talk about something

1354
01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:28.939
<i>not so pleasant.</i>

1355
01:24:29.315 --> 01:24:30.399
Well. what is it?

1356
01:24:30.483 --> 01:24:31.817
It's our investors.

1357
01:24:33.527 --> 01:24:34.945
- They're not happy.
- What do you mean?

1358
01:24:35.029 --> 01:24:36.447
Is there--
Did they tell you that?

1359
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:37.656
<i>Can you blame them?</i>

1360
01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:42.286
The... materials are overpriced.
the construction is delayed.

1361
01:24:42.369 --> 01:24:43.579
<i>Do you know how many people</i>

1362
01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:44.830
<i>are undertaking this town?</i>

1363
01:24:44.914 --> 01:24:47.041
I can't screw in a light bulb
without a city official

1364
01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:48.918
and his goddamn maid
coming for a handout.

1365
01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:50.669
- That's the deal.
<i>- The accounting is sloppy.</i>

1366
01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:53.089
Ben. and sloppy accounting
leads to concern.

1367
01:24:53.172 --> 01:24:54.882
Do me a favor.
Remind them that we own

1368
01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:56.383
66 percent of this casino.

1369
01:24:56.467 --> 01:24:58.886
which means we get to decide
who gets to be concerned.

1370
01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:01.097
66 percent of nothing
is nothing.

1371
01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.642
We have to put money back in
to cover the cash flow problem.

1372
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:10.064
Were you planning on talking
to me about this?

1373
01:25:10.856 --> 01:25:11.857
Of course.

1374
01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:14.026
Of course. I mean.
what'd you think

1375
01:25:14.110 --> 01:25:16.112
I wasn't gonna have that
conversation with you?

1376
01:25:17.488 --> 01:25:18.948
How much are we talking about.
Ben?

1377
01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:21.992
Half a million.

1378
01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:25.621
Maybe another three
just to get us

1379
01:25:26.247 --> 01:25:27.748
through a few months.

1380
01:25:31.168 --> 01:25:32.461
I'll turn it around. Meyer.

1381
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:35.589
I know you will. Ben.

1382
01:25:37.007 --> 01:25:38.425
That's what I told Lucky.

1383
01:25:41.929 --> 01:25:44.056
I'm not gonna let you down.
I swear.

1384
01:25:45.182 --> 01:25:47.518
I know. Ben.

1385
01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:56.652
You're listening in on my calls?

1386
01:25:57.695 --> 01:25:58.946
He's a bum.

1387
01:26:01.365 --> 01:26:03.617
He's a bum and you know it.

1388
01:26:04.201 --> 01:26:05.828
It's not your concern. Anne.

1389
01:26:06.412 --> 01:26:07.872
He's gonna get you killed.

1390
01:26:08.414 --> 01:26:10.040
They'll kill you both.

1391
01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:12.126
Bang. bang.

1392
01:26:13.627 --> 01:26:15.171
Goodbye. Meyer Lansky.

1393
01:26:16.172 --> 01:26:17.882
May he rest in peace.

1394
01:26:19.425 --> 01:26:20.426
Father.

1395
01:26:22.595 --> 01:26:24.471
Husband.

1396
01:26:24.555 --> 01:26:25.723
Murderer.

1397
01:26:25.806 --> 01:26:28.851
- Stay out of this.
- How about I jump. huh?

1398
01:26:28.934 --> 01:26:30.019
Right off this balcony--

1399
01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:31.187
- Don't be ridiculous.
- ...and save you

1400
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:32.271
all that trouble.

1401
01:26:32.938 --> 01:26:34.106
Come on.

1402
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:35.524
Would make your day.

1403
01:26:36.567 --> 01:26:39.862
Don't pretend like you care
for my well-being.

1404
01:26:41.614 --> 01:26:44.742
All you care for is your money.

1405
01:26:45.618 --> 01:26:48.370
It's your money. money.
money. money. money.

1406
01:26:48.454 --> 01:26:49.538
- Your money.
- Enough!

1407
01:26:49.622 --> 01:26:51.582
No!

1408
01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:54.668
You murderer. you're a murderer!

1409
01:26:54.752 --> 01:26:56.378
Get off!
Liar!

1410
01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:03.469
Get off me!

1411
01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:04.762
No!

1412
01:27:05.179 --> 01:27:06.764
Hey. call an ambulance.

1413
01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:08.557
- No. Meyer!
- It's my wife.

1414
01:27:08.641 --> 01:27:10.267
- No. Meyer.
- She's hysterical.

1415
01:27:10.351 --> 01:27:11.435
No!

1416
01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:12.686
- Meyer!
- There's something wrong...

1417
01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:13.771
in her head.

1418
01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:16.065
Just get a doctor here now!

1419
01:28:03.279 --> 01:28:05.030
Well. goddamn.

1420
01:28:07.491 --> 01:28:09.952
Meyer. oy.

1421
01:28:10.995 --> 01:28:11.996
Look at this place.

1422
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:15.416
Nice. hmm.

1423
01:28:15.499 --> 01:28:16.667
Are you kidding me?

1424
01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:18.627
You're the king
of the goddamn domain.

1425
01:28:18.711 --> 01:28:19.837
I'll tell you something. too.

1426
01:28:21.255 --> 01:28:23.007
You breathe a little different
down here.

1427
01:28:23.924 --> 01:28:27.511
- How's your flight?
- Ah. forget about that.

1428
01:28:28.095 --> 01:28:29.847
Real question is. what do
we got lined up for tonight?

1429
01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:32.224
Hmm.

1430
01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:34.435
- Oh. boy.
- Come on.

1431
01:28:39.565 --> 01:28:40.816
<i>Things have changed. Ben.</i>

1432
01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:41.900
Look around you.

1433
01:28:43.944 --> 01:28:46.572
There's too much money at stake
to be fucking around.

1434
01:28:48.324 --> 01:28:49.658
We're not kids anymore.

1435
01:28:49.742 --> 01:28:50.951
Yeah.

1436
01:28:52.995 --> 01:28:54.038
You're right.

1437
01:28:54.455 --> 01:28:56.040
I can't keep defending you.

1438
01:28:58.292 --> 01:29:00.085
Especially if you don't show
any results.

1439
01:29:00.461 --> 01:29:01.962
Is that what you're doin'?

1440
01:29:03.130 --> 01:29:04.214
You're defending me?

1441
01:29:04.298 --> 01:29:05.382
The Meyer I used to know.

1442
01:29:05.466 --> 01:29:06.967
he would've stood up
for his pal.

1443
01:29:14.725 --> 01:29:16.060
You know...

1444
01:29:18.103 --> 01:29:19.563
there was never
an option for me.

1445
01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:22.608
What was I gonna be.
a tailor's son.

1446
01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:23.984
make eight bucks a week?

1447
01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:28.530
But you could have
done anything.

1448
01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.035
And I looked up to you
my whole life for that.

1449
01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:41.668
But following you...

1450
01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:48.926
I don't know. Meyer.

1451
01:29:49.635 --> 01:29:51.136
I don't know
if it was worth my soul.

1452
01:29:54.139 --> 01:29:56.767
'Cause I don't know
how to get that back.

1453
01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:23.043
I'm aware that I was called here
today to bear witness

1454
01:30:23.419 --> 01:30:29.883
to your decision
to kill my friend. Ben Siegel.

1455
01:30:30.843 --> 01:30:33.387
Benny saved my life
on more than one occasion.

1456
01:30:36.223 --> 01:30:40.436
I cannot sit here and
watch you condemn him to death.

1457
01:30:42.104 --> 01:30:43.856
But he's been robbin' from us.
Meyer.

1458
01:30:45.023 --> 01:30:47.359
I'm aware of
Benny's shortcomings.

1459
01:30:48.735 --> 01:30:55.409
I'm also aware that many of us
would not be sitting here today

1460
01:30:56.326 --> 01:30:58.745
if it weren't for
Benny's past loyalty

1461
01:30:59.288 --> 01:31:03.041
and his willingness
to stick out his neck.

1462
01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:08.338
If it's about money.

1463
01:31:09.381 --> 01:31:12.217
I've agreed to make amends
for his past mistakes.

1464
01:31:14.094 --> 01:31:18.098
If it's about honor.
I ask you.

1465
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:23.270
where is the honor
in killing a friend?

1466
01:31:33.947 --> 01:31:35.699
Why don't you step outside.
Meyer?

1467
01:31:58.055 --> 01:31:59.640
In the matter of Bugsy Siegel...

1468
01:32:01.683 --> 01:32:02.768
Aye.

1469
01:32:03.393 --> 01:32:04.394
Aye.

1470
01:32:04.811 --> 01:32:06.605
- Aye.
- Aye.

1471
01:32:07.356 --> 01:32:08.607
Aye.

1472
01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:09.691
Aye.

1473
01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:14.780
Aye.

1474
01:32:59.032 --> 01:33:00.158
Hello?

1475
01:33:00.576 --> 01:33:01.577
<i>Daddy?</i>

1476
01:33:02.661 --> 01:33:04.413
- Eva?
<i>- Yes.</i>

1477
01:33:05.956 --> 01:33:08.458
Eva. what are you--
What are you doing up?

1478
01:33:08.542 --> 01:33:10.002
What time is it?

1479
01:33:10.085 --> 01:33:11.670
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

1480
01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:14.256
"I couldn't sleep."

1481
01:33:14.339 --> 01:33:15.757
Honey. you gotta get to sleep.

1482
01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:17.551
Got school tomorrow.

1483
01:33:17.634 --> 01:33:19.761
<i>But tomorrow is Saturday.</i>

1484
01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:22.598
Okay.

1485
01:33:23.849 --> 01:33:24.933
Where's your mama?

1486
01:33:25.642 --> 01:33:27.019
<i>She went out.</i>

1487
01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:30.105
She went out. out where?

1488
01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:32.232
<i>With some man.</i>

1489
01:33:36.778 --> 01:33:38.363
You know. these things...

1490
01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:42.409
It's--that's what's
gonna happen. you know?

1491
01:33:46.455 --> 01:33:50.584
<i>Daddy.
do you still love Mommy?</i>

1492
01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:55.088
Honey. I love you.

1493
01:33:58.175 --> 01:33:59.593
I love you.

1494
01:34:01.678 --> 01:34:03.055
Mrs. Lansky.

1495
01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:05.807
Who is it?

1496
01:34:05.891 --> 01:34:07.893
It's Frank Rivers.
ma'am. we spoke on the phone.

1497
01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:10.896
Oh. yes.

1498
01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:12.939
I remember.

1499
01:34:13.273 --> 01:34:14.274
Sit down.

1500
01:34:14.983 --> 01:34:16.026
Thank you.

1501
01:34:21.281 --> 01:34:23.784
You know. there's no way in hell
you're going to find

1502
01:34:23.867 --> 01:34:25.661
that bastard's money.

1503
01:34:26.286 --> 01:34:27.621
Why is that?

1504
01:34:28.997 --> 01:34:31.124
My ex-husband. Meyer.

1505
01:34:32.334 --> 01:34:34.961
he never let a dime
out of his sight.

1506
01:34:40.342 --> 01:34:42.511
If I were you.
I would look to Cuba.

1507
01:34:44.137 --> 01:34:47.307
That is where Meyer made
his first real money.

1508
01:34:48.183 --> 01:34:50.769
I thought he lost everything
when Castro took over.

1509
01:34:50.852 --> 01:34:53.647
You think he would
give all that money

1510
01:34:53.730 --> 01:34:55.440
to a communist?

1511
01:34:56.608 --> 01:35:00.737
That Batista.
he trusted no one. only Meyer.

1512
01:35:02.948 --> 01:35:04.908
He gave Meyer
what Meyer wanted.

1513
01:35:06.993 --> 01:35:08.161
And what was that?

1514
01:35:09.079 --> 01:35:12.624
To turn that country
into the Monte Carlo

1515
01:35:12.708 --> 01:35:15.043
of the Caribbean. Hm.

1516
01:35:17.838 --> 01:35:20.006
If only it had lasted.

1517
01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:22.551
Pfft.

1518
01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:29.766
Here's one of his diets.

1519
01:35:30.183 --> 01:35:32.728
Matza. sardine. Jello.
and Irish stew.

1520
01:35:32.811 --> 01:35:34.104
- Blegh.
- Ugh.

1521
01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:37.899
Hey. there's a Lansky associate
in Geneva.

1522
01:35:38.692 --> 01:35:39.901
That might be our guy.

1523
01:35:40.444 --> 01:35:42.404
Let's get Stone to run it
by Lansky.

1524
01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.323
I got it. of course.

1525
01:35:46.032 --> 01:35:48.744
Hey David.
I got a message for you.

1526
01:35:49.786 --> 01:35:50.954
From Mr. Lansky.

1527
01:36:12.601 --> 01:36:14.019
What--what do you want?

1528
01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:16.396
I'm beginning to think
you're not taking me seriously.

1529
01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.440
Hey. he's not even here.
I've got nothing.

1530
01:36:18.774 --> 01:36:20.734
Man. I think we're done.
I think the book is done.

1531
01:36:20.817 --> 01:36:21.985
- Listen to me.
- I think--

1532
01:36:22.068 --> 01:36:23.695
We're looking for an associate
of Lansky's.

1533
01:36:23.779 --> 01:36:25.489
He goes by the name "Pinchas."

1534
01:36:26.490 --> 01:36:27.908
He's 81. all right?

1535
01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:29.826
His mind's not that sharp.

1536
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:32.037
I think that some of the stuff
he's been saying is--

1537
01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.371
It's a little incoherent.

1538
01:36:33.455 --> 01:36:35.957
Trust me.
he'll remember this name.

1539
01:36:36.041 --> 01:36:38.084
Find out who he is. okay?

1540
01:36:39.252 --> 01:36:40.670
You've got a pen.
I'll write it down.

1541
01:36:40.754 --> 01:36:43.298
Pink-ass.
that you could remember.

1542
01:36:52.849 --> 01:36:54.100
Hello. David.

1543
01:36:54.184 --> 01:36:55.435
Come in. come in.

1544
01:36:57.562 --> 01:36:59.272
<i>I didn't
feel like going out today.</i>

1545
01:37:00.106 --> 01:37:01.233
<i>You want coffee?</i>

1546
01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:02.567
<i>No. thanks. I'm fine.</i>

1547
01:37:07.155 --> 01:37:08.240
Is that your father?

1548
01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:18.500
When Israel turned me down.

1549
01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:20.710
all I could think about was
how embarrassed

1550
01:37:20.794 --> 01:37:22.254
he would have been.

1551
01:37:24.047 --> 01:37:25.757
I was always ashamed of him.

1552
01:37:26.883 --> 01:37:28.677
In my mind. he was weak.

1553
01:37:29.386 --> 01:37:31.805
Busted his balls
earning pennies.

1554
01:37:33.223 --> 01:37:36.226
He felt the same about me.
shame.

1555
01:37:36.893 --> 01:37:39.312
for having a gangster
for a son.

1556
01:37:45.944 --> 01:37:49.030
I didn't go to his funeral.
my own father.

1557
01:37:51.783 --> 01:37:53.994
I don't have the power
to change my past.

1558
01:37:54.077 --> 01:37:57.455
I do have the power to change
the perception of it.

1559
01:37:58.874 --> 01:38:02.168
Do what I ask
and you will be rewarded.

1560
01:38:04.337 --> 01:38:05.797
You will do what I ask.

1561
01:38:06.506 --> 01:38:07.674
<i>Let's sit on the porch.</i>

1562
01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:09.217
They're in the back now.
Switch over to two.

1563
01:38:16.141 --> 01:38:17.601
- What's going on?
- We lost him.

1564
01:38:18.184 --> 01:38:19.519
He knows we're listening to him.

1565
01:38:19.895 --> 01:38:21.146
Goddammit.

1566
01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.277
There's a name that came up
in my research.

1567
01:38:27.777 --> 01:38:29.279
someone named "Pinchas."

1568
01:38:32.908 --> 01:38:33.909
Huh?

1569
01:38:34.534 --> 01:38:36.536
Someone named "Pinchas"?

1570
01:38:39.497 --> 01:38:41.041
You mean Sal Rosenstein.

1571
01:38:41.875 --> 01:38:43.376
Tough son of a bitch.

1572
01:38:43.793 --> 01:38:46.171
His entire family died
at Dachau.

1573
01:38:47.172 --> 01:38:49.382
After the war.
he moved to Switzerland.

1574
01:38:49.758 --> 01:38:51.259
did some banking for me.

1575
01:38:52.302 --> 01:38:54.054
Pinchas was my nickname for him.

1576
01:38:59.726 --> 01:39:02.771
Wanted Pinchas's identity.
Get a pen.

1577
01:39:04.022 --> 01:39:05.815
Sal Rosenstein.

1578
01:39:07.943 --> 01:39:09.277
Yeah. yeah.

1579
01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:10.570
Put the money
in my wife's account

1580
01:39:10.654 --> 01:39:11.988
and make sure they're safe.

1581
01:39:12.072 --> 01:39:13.823
And leave my family alone.

1582
01:39:24.918 --> 01:39:26.002
We found him.

1583
01:39:27.170 --> 01:39:28.922
Who. Rosenstein?

1584
01:39:29.005 --> 01:39:30.173
Yeah. he was in Geneva.

1585
01:39:31.091 --> 01:39:33.385
- Where is he now?
- He died 48 hours ago.

1586
01:39:50.652 --> 01:39:51.736
Yeah. what?

1587
01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:52.988
<i>It's Rivers.</i>

1588
01:39:53.071 --> 01:39:55.323
<i>Sal Rosenstein
was killed in a car accident</i>

1589
01:39:55.407 --> 01:39:57.826
<i>- 48 hours ago.</i>
- Say again?

1590
01:39:57.909 --> 01:39:59.661
<i>I'm saying
that Lansky had him killed.</i>

1591
01:39:59.744 --> 01:40:01.204
<i>This is not a coincidence.</i>

1592
01:40:01.287 --> 01:40:03.415
<i>I would advise you
to stop talking to Lansky.</i>

1593
01:40:16.928 --> 01:40:18.596
Mr. Rivers.
as soon as you called.

1594
01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:20.724
we started running a query
into our database.

1595
01:40:21.266 --> 01:40:23.351
It appears Mr. Rosenstein
moved his money

1596
01:40:23.435 --> 01:40:25.895
primarily to one place. Israel.

1597
01:40:25.979 --> 01:40:27.647
Rosenstein was Mossad.

1598
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:30.191
<i>We've got a paper trail
of laundered money</i>

1599
01:40:30.275 --> 01:40:33.820
going in and out of Geneva
into Israel to a bank

1600
01:40:33.903 --> 01:40:35.238
called "Mekif."

1601
01:40:35.321 --> 01:40:36.990
And you think that money
was Lansky's?

1602
01:40:37.073 --> 01:40:39.200
I think it's why Lansky wanted
to get into Israel.

1603
01:40:39.284 --> 01:40:40.285
His money's there.

1604
01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:49.294
Mr. Rivers. welcome to Israel.

1605
01:40:49.377 --> 01:40:50.670
We've been expecting you.

1606
01:40:51.254 --> 01:40:53.506
I will be taking you down
to the vault.

1607
01:40:58.261 --> 01:40:59.846
Here it is.

1608
01:41:00.472 --> 01:41:01.890
Thank you.

1609
01:41:19.407 --> 01:41:20.700
Son of a bitch.

1610
01:41:20.784 --> 01:41:22.160
And God said to Abraham.

1611
01:41:22.243 --> 01:41:27.165
"Abraham. take your son.
your only son whom you love.

1612
01:41:27.248 --> 01:41:30.835
Isaac. and sacrifice him
upon one of the mountains

1613
01:41:30.919 --> 01:41:32.212
that I will tell you."

1614
01:41:32.587 --> 01:41:36.633
And Abraham went forth
with Isaac to do just that.

1615
01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:40.428
But perhaps what God
really wanted was for Abraham

1616
01:41:40.512 --> 01:41:42.430
to say no.

1617
01:41:43.431 --> 01:41:46.726
We praise God now for those
who have departed this world

1618
01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:51.147
as we stand for the Kaddish.
let us all stand.

1619
01:42:10.041 --> 01:42:11.960
Mr. Lansky. Mr. Lansky.

1620
01:42:12.043 --> 01:42:13.169
David.

1621
01:42:14.212 --> 01:42:15.380
Prayer for the dead. right?

1622
01:42:15.713 --> 01:42:17.632
Kaddish.
Is that for your father?

1623
01:42:17.715 --> 01:42:19.509
Or was it for Sal Rosenstein?

1624
01:42:19.926 --> 01:42:24.055
Remember Sal Rosenstein?
Your friend Pinchas? He's dead.

1625
01:42:24.931 --> 01:42:26.349
Yeah. he died in a car accident.

1626
01:42:27.559 --> 01:42:28.893
I'm sorry to hear that.

1627
01:42:28.977 --> 01:42:30.311
Three days ago.

1628
01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:35.817
Are you suggesting
I had something to do with it?

1629
01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:37.402
I just think
it's a bit coincidental.

1630
01:42:37.485 --> 01:42:38.611
we were just talking about him

1631
01:42:38.695 --> 01:42:42.365
and then... something terrible
happens to him.

1632
01:42:44.242 --> 01:42:45.577
Maybe he's dead

1633
01:42:46.244 --> 01:42:48.163
or maybe they just think
he's dead.

1634
01:42:48.872 --> 01:42:50.039
Just tell me the truth.

1635
01:42:50.123 --> 01:42:52.500
You mean like the truth of
you speaking to the Feds?

1636
01:42:55.837 --> 01:42:58.256
You betrayed me. David.
you broke my heart.

1637
01:42:58.339 --> 01:43:00.758
you made a deal with me
and you broke your word.

1638
01:43:00.842 --> 01:43:02.260
Yeah. I did talk to them.

1639
01:43:02.343 --> 01:43:04.012
I did. yeah.

1640
01:43:04.762 --> 01:43:06.097
You know why I did it?

1641
01:43:07.432 --> 01:43:09.058
You call it "self-preservation."
I think.

1642
01:43:09.142 --> 01:43:11.477
Right. I had to do
what I had to do for my family.

1643
01:43:12.270 --> 01:43:13.521
I stand by it.

1644
01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:16.983
I forgive you. David.

1645
01:43:18.610 --> 01:43:20.361
If you wanna hear
the rest of the story...

1646
01:43:21.237 --> 01:43:22.238
Why'd you forgive me?

1647
01:43:23.364 --> 01:43:24.699
'Cause I like you.

1648
01:43:26.242 --> 01:43:28.620
You liked Sal Rosenstein. too.

1649
01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:30.580
Not really.

1650
01:43:35.084 --> 01:43:36.544
<i>And now you come to Israel.</i>

1651
01:43:36.628 --> 01:43:37.629
<i>for what reason?</i>

1652
01:43:38.546 --> 01:43:40.924
You want to become
an Israeli citizen. Mr. Lansky?

1653
01:43:41.007 --> 01:43:42.342
I do.

1654
01:43:43.259 --> 01:43:47.305
My association with Israel
stands many years back.

1655
01:43:48.348 --> 01:43:49.599
I was born a Jew.

1656
01:43:50.391 --> 01:43:52.268
<i>I have all my life
lived as a Jew.</i>

1657
01:43:52.352 --> 01:43:55.980
<i>I never changed my faith.</i>

1658
01:43:56.356 --> 01:43:57.982
<i>My grandparents
are buried here.</i>

1659
01:43:58.566 --> 01:43:59.901
<i>Why are the American</i>

1660
01:43:59.984 --> 01:44:01.569
<i>authorities after you?</i>

1661
01:44:01.653 --> 01:44:03.488
<i>They claim I have 50 percent</i>

1662
01:44:03.571 --> 01:44:05.073
<i>of Lebanon casinos.</i>

1663
01:44:05.156 --> 01:44:06.866
<i>50 percent of Monte Carlo.</i>

1664
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:08.243
<i>Mr. Lansky. is there</i>

1665
01:44:08.326 --> 01:44:10.370
<i>such a thing
as organized crime?</i>

1666
01:44:11.454 --> 01:44:13.164
<i>I have no knowledge
on the subject</i>

1667
01:44:14.082 --> 01:44:16.751
<i>and I'd like to live
the remainder of my days</i>

1668
01:44:16.834 --> 01:44:18.294
<i>in Israel.</i>

1669
01:44:25.051 --> 01:44:30.932
I got a tip from a friend.
Golda Meir is lobbying Nixon

1670
01:44:31.015 --> 01:44:33.768
to supply Israel
with F-4 fighter bombers.

1671
01:44:34.102 --> 01:44:35.478
What's that got to do with me?

1672
01:44:35.561 --> 01:44:37.146
The prime minister was told

1673
01:44:37.230 --> 01:44:38.940
that in order for that deal
to go through.

1674
01:44:39.023 --> 01:44:41.734
she'd have to see to that
you leave Israel

1675
01:44:41.818 --> 01:44:43.152
and return to the U.S.

1676
01:44:43.486 --> 01:44:46.698
State Department
is revoking your passport.

1677
01:44:46.781 --> 01:44:48.908
You need to surrender
at the embassy.

1678
01:44:48.992 --> 01:44:53.037
The Law of Return says
every Jew has the right

1679
01:44:53.454 --> 01:44:55.999
to citizenship in Israel.

1680
01:44:57.333 --> 01:44:58.710
There's nothing I can do.

1681
01:44:59.377 --> 01:45:00.461
I'm sorry.

1682
01:45:00.545 --> 01:45:03.131
After everything I did
for this country.

1683
01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:06.592
after all I gave them
when they begged me for money.

1684
01:45:07.427 --> 01:45:09.679
for weapons.
Doesn't she remember?

1685
01:45:09.762 --> 01:45:13.099
This is how they repay me.
making me the only Jew

1686
01:45:13.182 --> 01:45:15.893
in history to be banned
from his country?

1687
01:45:16.436 --> 01:45:17.603
How dare she?

1688
01:45:17.687 --> 01:45:19.105
How dare she?

1689
01:45:20.982 --> 01:45:23.318
They've already arranged
for your return to the US.

1690
01:45:23.818 --> 01:45:25.361
They're charging you
with contempt of court--

1691
01:45:25.445 --> 01:45:27.280
- Oh. my God.
- ...and conspiracy related

1692
01:45:27.363 --> 01:45:29.866
to your ownership
at the Flamingo Hotel.

1693
01:45:29.949 --> 01:45:31.409
I won't go back there.

1694
01:45:31.492 --> 01:45:34.245
I want you to help me
find a place.

1695
01:45:34.329 --> 01:45:35.705
a country that will take me.

1696
01:45:36.497 --> 01:45:38.249
I have money.
Name the price.

1697
01:45:39.292 --> 01:45:40.835
I don't want your money. Meyer.

1698
01:45:41.210 --> 01:45:43.004
I believe your people
have betrayed you.

1699
01:45:46.341 --> 01:45:47.550
I'll say.

1700
01:45:55.183 --> 01:45:57.518
And after all that. they
were never able to indict you.

1701
01:45:59.395 --> 01:46:02.398
The charges against me.
contempt of court.

1702
01:46:02.774 --> 01:46:05.735
conspiracy. they were dropped.

1703
01:46:09.155 --> 01:46:10.782
You couldn't go back to Israel?

1704
01:46:14.410 --> 01:46:17.914
The wandering Jew.
just like Lucky said.

1705
01:46:25.630 --> 01:46:27.673
Have we arrived at the end
of my story?

1706
01:46:40.228 --> 01:46:41.312
What about the money?

1707
01:46:50.571 --> 01:46:51.781
Hm.

1708
01:46:53.199 --> 01:46:54.534
Come for a ride.

1709
01:47:37.326 --> 01:47:38.536
Buddy.

1710
01:48:30.254 --> 01:48:31.422
Gangster?

1711
01:48:35.801 --> 01:48:40.515
I'm an angel
with a dirty face.

1712
01:48:50.733 --> 01:48:53.110
I think we're finished. David.

1713
01:48:54.278 --> 01:48:55.655
Go home.

1714
01:48:58.824 --> 01:48:59.825
To your family.

1715
01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:03.913
Remember me.

1716
01:49:51.919 --> 01:49:53.588
<i>When all is said and done.</i>

1717
01:49:55.590 --> 01:49:57.508
<i>how do we measure ourselves?</i>

1718
01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.804
<i>If Lansky taught me anything.
it's that</i>

1719
01:50:02.138 --> 01:50:03.639
<i>there's only one measure
in this world</i>

1720
01:50:03.723 --> 01:50:05.349
<i>that truly matters.</i>

1721
01:50:07.393 --> 01:50:08.811
<i>We measure ourselves
through the eyes</i>

1722
01:50:08.894 --> 01:50:10.354
<i>of the ones we love.</i>

1723
01:50:22.199 --> 01:50:23.576
<i>Somewhere on
a stretch of highway</i>

1724
01:50:23.659 --> 01:50:26.120
<i>between Miami and home.
it all made sense.</i>

1725
01:50:26.537 --> 01:50:28.998
<i>Lansky spent his life
trying to control the game.</i>

1726
01:50:29.665 --> 01:50:32.209
<i>but in the end.
he knew there was one game</i>

1727
01:50:32.293 --> 01:50:35.546
<i>that no one gets to control.
life itself.</i>

1728
01:50:36.213 --> 01:50:38.007
<i>And you can try
to beat the odds.</i>

1729
01:50:38.633 --> 01:50:40.343
<i>But the house always wins.</i>

1730
01:50:41.552 --> 01:50:42.928
<i>Maybe all you need
every now and then</i>

1731
01:50:43.012 --> 01:50:44.430
<i>is a winning streak.</i>

1732
01:50:51.687 --> 01:50:52.688
You wanted to see me?

1733
01:50:53.272 --> 01:50:54.440
Yeah. come on in. Frank.

1734
01:51:01.113 --> 01:51:02.740
We're shutting
the investigation down.

1735
01:51:03.532 --> 01:51:04.825
Wait. what?

1736
01:51:05.409 --> 01:51:07.495
- Why?
- It's over. Frank.

1737
01:51:11.666 --> 01:51:13.584
Who's killing it?
The CIA?

1738
01:51:22.176 --> 01:51:24.303
Before your time. sonny boy.
