00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:09.170
Huh.

5
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.780
Come be my therapist. baby.

6
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.380
Yeah.

7
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.000
Come be my therapist. baby.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.330
You. who I'm sharing with. baby.
let me lay in your presence.

9
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.280
Yes. it's so effortless.
baby. because you're

10
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.130
so easy to talk to. I
often wish we was closer.

11
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.780
I hope for the
sessions to bless us.

12
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.490
Yes. I might need to stay over.

13
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.610
Holding trauma from drama. now.
I can't tell if they love me.

14
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.350
But when we look
for the problem.

15
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.880
I always find out it was me.

16
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.380
Hug me. baby. I miss you.

17
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.090
Don't take negative with you.

18
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.980
Only positive vibes. baby.

19
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.300
I'll never forget you.

20
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.440
I do therapy with you.

21
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.610
Hey. Paul.

22
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.050
So I'm done cleaning here.

23
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.200
Am I good to go?

24
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.320
Hell. no. you ain't good to go.

25
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.320
Table two keeps ordering
crawfish after crawfish

26
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.028
after crawfish.

27
00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:51.320
I got to go to the Atlantic
Ocean to get more crawfish.

28
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.730
I'm might get mercury poisoning
dealing with table two.

29
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.230
All right.

30
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.470
30 more minutes.

31
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.280
You can do 30 more minutes?

32
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.863
Yeah. I guess.

33
00:00:55.863 --> 00:00:56.540
OK. cool.

34
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.200
Thank you.

35
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.580
Oh. wait one second.

36
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.080
Um. tomorrow-- do you think
you can come in at 6:00?

37
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.990
Are you serious?

38
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.080
JoJo having her
little situationship

39
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.830
on the situationship
on the situationship.

40
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.330
Again?

41
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.073
Yeah. again.

42
00:01:09.073 --> 00:01:10.740
And. come on. let me
rub your shoulders.

43
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.625
Come on. you get like
this sometimes. Mon.

44
00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:13.250
Hey. all right.

45
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.880
I do it for you.

46
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.380
OK.

47
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.380
Give me a hug.

48
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.380
All right.

49
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.880
All right.

50
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.100
Take care of them kids.

51
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.090
Say. mm-hmm.

52
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.642
Man.

53
00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:23.250
Whoof.

54
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.135
Hey. how are you doing. ma'am?

55
00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:27.260
You've been sitting here
for a little over an hour.

56
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.132
Everything OK?

57
00:01:28.132 --> 00:01:30.590
I know you're sitting down.
but you look a little stood up.

58
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.040
Heh.

59
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.240
You get to how I
put that together?

60
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.782
I can get you another
margarita. or--

61
00:01:33.782 --> 00:01:35.861
Does it look like
I need your help?

62
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.200
Yo. Paul. let me get a
double shot of A単ejo.

63
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.430
One for me. and one for her.

64
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.390
I got you.

65
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.390
Excuse me. sir. but I
can buy my own drinks.

66
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.750
Thanks. but no thanks.

67
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.250
Damn.

68
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.780
OK. Miss Independent.

69
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.290
I feel you.

70
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.937
Paul. let me get them two shots.

71
00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:54.520
Oh. I got you.

72
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.800
I'm sorry. baby.

73
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.780
He had you waiting.

74
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.080
What can I get for you?

75
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.850
Thank you so much.

76
00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.840
It's taken so long.

77
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.798
First. I would like to
start with my appetizer.

78
00:02:01.798 --> 00:02:04.190
I would like some
crawfish cheese sticks.

79
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.220
I would also like
crawfish nachos.

80
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.490
And I also would
like crawfish salad.

81
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.990
Yeah?

82
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.510
Really?

83
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.090
Mm.

84
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.780
Ooh!

85
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.650
Spicy.

86
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.900
I'm Reggie.

87
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.130
Stacey.

88
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.180
I see.

89
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.347
And you stay seeing this drip?

90
00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:35.180
What does that mean?

91
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.400
You don't even know me.

92
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.870
Margarita crawfish.

93
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.030
Margarita. make
sure that comes out.

94
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.030
And also crawfish
chicken nuggets.

95
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.660
You ever?

96
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.850
You look a little
down on your day.

97
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.850
And why are you taking it
out on my man Paul over here?

98
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.850
I am having a rough day.

99
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.180
Hey. Paul. I'm sorry.

100
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.504
Can you please get
us another round?

101
00:02:58.504 --> 00:03:00.210
Y-- y'all paying
for all of these?

102
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.710
Never mind.

103
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.877
We'll talk about this later.

104
00:03:01.877 --> 00:03:03.500
OK. Miss Independent.

105
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.450
Hey. Paul. another A単ejo.

106
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.120
Throw a lime in there this time.

107
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.690
A単ejo?

108
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.320
What is that?

109
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.360
See. you don't even
know nothing about that.

110
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.110
That's probably why
your 'rita trash.

111
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.190
It was pretty light.

112
00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:18.470
Paul. give her what I'm having.

113
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.150
A little less mix.

114
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.220
I usually just get silver.

115
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.540
What made you try that?

116
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.710
Oh. I drink A単ejo because
I can get "any ho."

117
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.850
You feel me?

118
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.850
Wow.

119
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.760
OK. so you are crazy.

120
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.190
I mean. is that supposed
to be funny or something?

121
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.120
See. now I got her attention.

122
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.962
She used to do is
being all forward

123
00:03:37.962 --> 00:03:39.920
and trying to hit on her
right out of the gate.

124
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.960
but she found comfortability
in my friendliness.

125
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.590
Now. she fine.

126
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.470
Fine as hell!

127
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.600
I got to see where
this chick mind at.

128
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.220
Watch me break her
down like a 3-5.

129
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.960
OK.

130
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.150
So who is it?

131
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.980
What are you talking about?

132
00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.360
The person that
got my new friend

133
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.840
in here drinking by herself.
all alone. in a bad-ass mood.

134
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.100
OK. so I don't even know why
I'm sharing this with you.

135
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.590
So look. this guy. he was
supposed to meet me here.

136
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.300
I mean. not really
for a date. but I'd

137
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.360
be lying if I said I wasn't
attracted to him. right?

138
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.089
Then I find out he's
really in a relationship

139
00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.880
and is currently on
a date as we speak.

140
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.990
Damn!

141
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.850
That's bogus as hell.

142
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.940
I mean. he at least
reached out to you

143
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.690
and let you know what
the deal was. right?

144
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.560
No.

145
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.660
Wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait. wait.

146
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.870
So you mean to tell me you
just came across the photo?

147
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.520
Like it was just
on your timeline.

148
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.320
or did you go searching for it?

149
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.210
Because you look
like a searcher.

150
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.780
No.

151
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.310
Hell. no. I didn't
do none of that.

152
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.090
Look. I was seeing if he posted
a stat. and I saw that shit.

153
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.690
So let me guess.

154
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.180
You must have had
a goal in mind.

155
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.650
Oh. wait.

156
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.540
You was trying to
get some. wasn't you?

157
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.040
OK.

158
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.390
So is it that obvious?

159
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.090
I mean. I was trying to
get me some from Travis.

160
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.200
but. you know what?

161
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.520
Uh-uh.

162
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.850
I carry myself as
a classy lady. OK?

163
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.562
How did he even know?

164
00:05:07.562 --> 00:05:10.390
And what the hell
do you mean by that?

165
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.090
I mean. damn.

166
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.732
Calm down.

167
00:05:11.732 --> 00:05:13.190
I ain't got no
scientific reasoning

168
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.648
behind it or
anything. but you just

169
00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:17.130
look a little more let down
than the normal disappointment.

170
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.050
That's all I'm saying.

171
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.930
It sound like
expectations to me.

172
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.390
Now. I'm not saying
you had a plan.

173
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.960
But if the night would have
went right. and you felt right.

174
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.460
you was going to give him some.

175
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.000
Oh. so what?

176
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.140
Now you a therapist?

177
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.540
Hell. no!

178
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.280
I just know people.

179
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.832
That's it.

180
00:05:34.832 --> 00:05:36.540
And I don't judge them
for their actions.

181
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.850
I let them show me
who they really are.

182
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:39.350
You know.

183
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.225
It kind of provides them
with a certain level

184
00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:42.710
of comfortability with me.

185
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.190
That's not even a real word.

186
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.380
So I'm a real nigga. and what's
up with you and your drink.

187
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.130
Miss Lightweight?

188
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.088
Don't worry about what
I'm doing with my drink.

189
00:05:51.088 --> 00:05:53.210
The question is.
why are you in here?

190
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.890
Oh. I ain't got no sob story.

191
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.440
All my whole school.
every last one of them.

192
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.223
I'm just playing.

193
00:06:00.223 --> 00:06:02.390
I just wanted to get out
of the house. have a drink.

194
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.920
Supposed to meet
my boy Sean here.

195
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.610
but he probably off
with some girl somewhere

196
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.540
in full character.

197
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.790
What does full character mean?

198
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.810
What is that?

199
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.550
He like to give
women what they want.

200
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.350
Well. let me rephrase that.

201
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.870
What he thinks they want.

202
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.020
But it always work
out terribly for him.

203
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.820
But. like I said. I'm
not here to judge.

204
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.530
That's his life.

205
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.600
Enough about him. though.

206
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.760
I'm interested in you.

207
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.700
How about we toast
to the dumbass

208
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.450
that stood your fine ass up?

209
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.290
I like that.

210
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.655
Mm-hmm.

211
00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:39.475
We can toast to that.

212
00:06:39.475 --> 00:06:41.950
Y'all don't-- y'all
don't want to--

213
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:42.782
Mm. this is strong.

214
00:06:42.782 --> 00:06:43.530
OK.

215
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.030
Yeah.

216
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.447
I'm going to put
that to the side.

217
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.560
I see you not big
on the cuddling.

218
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.180
That's cool.

219
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.820
I was never really
big on it either.

220
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.630
Look.

221
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.310
Last night was a
mistake. period.

222
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.700
But it happened. though.

223
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.090
I don't be doing shit like this.

224
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.485
But you did it. though.

225
00:07:54.485 --> 00:07:55.110
I've got to go.

226
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.360
I'm going to be late for work.

227
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.740
What is it that you do?

228
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.330
I'm a therapist.

229
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.100
Relationship counselor. mainly.

230
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.800
Oh.

231
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.270
So you help lonely people
cope with their misery.

232
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.130
No. I'm more like a mediator.

233
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.770
You know. I help solve conflict.

234
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.185
Almost like finding the
pieces to their puzzle.

235
00:08:15.185 --> 00:08:16.040
Mm.

236
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.880
So you sell dreams to
delusional couples.

237
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.910
Got you.

238
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:22.460
You know what?

239
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.130
You got all the
answers. don't you?

240
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.320
I ain't got all of
them. because I still

241
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.290
ain't got the answer as to why
you think this was a mistake.

242
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.539
Because I don't
even know you. OK?

243
00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:34.740
We just met last night.

244
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.740
And honestly. you could
be crazy for all I know.

245
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:37.775
Hell.

246
00:08:37.775 --> 00:08:39.139
I don't know you.

247
00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:39.639
Right.

248
00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.220
And I'm the crazy one?

249
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.850
OK.

250
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.560
But if this wasn't
supposed to happen.

251
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.550
then it wouldn't have happened.

252
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.740
You're one of the types that
like to trip about stuff that

253
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.760
already happened. huh?

254
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.430
How good of a therapist
can you really be?

255
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.050
What's that supposed to mean?

256
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.510
I'm just saying. like--

257
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.130
if you want to be
good at your job.

258
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.220
you should probably be better
at letting go with a past.

259
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:05.850
Wow.

260
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:06.897
OK. you know what?

261
00:09:06.897 --> 00:09:08.730
I'm not enjoying this
conversation. not even

262
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:09.300
a little bit.

263
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.700
So you're telling me you
ain't enjoy last night?

264
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.820
I mean. I did enjoy
last night. but--

265
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.800
But nothing.

266
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.370
Exactly.

267
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.625
The only "but" I want to hear
is my hand smacking an ass!

268
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:26.750
I'm done.

269
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.345
Why don't you stop.

270
00:09:27.345 --> 00:09:28.200
I'm done with you.

271
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.270
You make me sick.

272
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.190
OK. so I really didn't
have a bad time last night.

273
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.890
Oh. my gosh. it was so amazing.

274
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.860
And. I mean. Reggie.
he's so cool.

275
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.940
He's laid back.

276
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.080
He's witty.

277
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.650
And the things he did
in this bed right here.

278
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.430
Shit!

279
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.690
Oh. OK. OK. OK.

280
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.211
But I don't think
I'm ready for this.

281
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.380
I'm so conflicted right now.

282
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.060
OK. so I got a question.

283
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.700
You one of them know girls
who drink and they black out?

284
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.550
Oh. so you used to messing with
them lightweight thots. huh?

285
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.420
Uh-huh.

286
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.070
Yeah. I remember everything.

287
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.450
Oh. perfect.

288
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.160
So that means you remember
that butt-naked pretzel

289
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.030
I had you in going stupid.

290
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.790
OK. so you one of those kind
of guys that just think sex

291
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:15.540
is everything?

292
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.290
OK. you know what?

293
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.000
I've been down this road before.

294
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.840
Goodbye.

295
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.060
I mean. if you ready to go. I
can walk you out to the door.

296
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.610
But you should
remember one thing.

297
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.780
Well. two things you
should take away.

298
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.490
One. how did you just assume
that I'm all about sex?

299
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.490
You didn't even take the
time to get to know me.

300
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.230
Now. I'm not here to
change your opinion

301
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.397
because that's your opinion.

302
00:10:37.397 --> 00:10:39.820
I'm just saying that
that's a little weird.

303
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.540
OK. you said two things.

304
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.500
You've got your dress
on inside out. player.

305
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.662
Fuck you.

306
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.977
Fucked the seams out of her.

307
00:10:53.977 --> 00:10:54.955
Whoo!

308
00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:15.590
She stuck
on my mind. she jiggy.

309
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.690
She stuck on my
mind. she worth it.

310
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.520
Stay on her grind. she working.

311
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.780
Shorty's so fine. she perfect.

312
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.790
Uh-huh.

313
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.990
I give her my time on purpose.

314
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.630
Yes. she look good
on them pictures.

315
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.980
Promise she finer in person.

316
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.930
Uh-huh.

317
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.000
In this shit. it
got to be different.

318
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.800
Feel like a lottery ticket.

319
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.750
With her the sky's the limit.

320
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.680
Uh-huh.

321
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.170
Because we in places
you fly to go visit.

322
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.160
We steady down in this shop.
and you niggas dying to hit it.

323
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:43.850
Yeah.

324
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.340
And I don't blame you
for trying to hit her.

325
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.930
She's certified a winner.

326
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.585
I saw you looking at me when
I walked through the door.

327
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.352
You must like what you see.

328
00:11:55.352 --> 00:11:56.810
It's a bit
around here.

329
00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:00.565
Mm.

330
00:12:00.565 --> 00:12:01.940
How about we go
back to my place?

331
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.530
She's
stuck on my mind.

332
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.450
She jiggy. shorty so fine.

333
00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.160
I'm telling you.
I'm making her mine.

334
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.670
You hear me?

335
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.170
Sir?

336
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:09.830
Mm-hmm.

337
00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.085
Yeah.

338
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.218
My fault. How may I--

339
00:12:12.218 --> 00:12:13.010
how may I help you?

340
00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.350
I mean. are you
working today or what?

341
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.130
Yeah. yeah.

342
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.440
What's going on. little man?

343
00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.040
OK.

344
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.790
Yeah.

345
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.170
How old are you?

346
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.330
Look. the last
barber we went to.

347
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.330
he fucked his hairline up and
put that little black painted

348
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.890
stuff on his forehead.

349
00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.530
And I just need you to
fix it right quick. OK?

350
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.550
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

351
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.100
I can go ahead and
take care of it.

352
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.480
Come on in here. little man.

353
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.260
Hop up on here.

354
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.540
Go get you right.

355
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.030
Get you all the way right.

356
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.530
Whoo!

357
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.230
What kind of cut
want. little man?

358
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.070
OK.

359
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:49.700
All right.

360
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.510
Don't-- don't worry about it.

361
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.135
Just forget it.

362
00:12:51.135 --> 00:12:52.922
I'm-- I'm going
to get you right.

363
00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.490
What you mean you don't
want to be with me?

364
00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.420
After all I've done?

365
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.860
What is it?

366
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.720
Is it another chick?

367
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.850
Then. what is it then?

368
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.860
What do you mean you
got to call me back?

369
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.730
Oh. hell no.

370
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.360
You're going to talk to--

371
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.190
Hello?

372
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.455
Hello?

373
00:13:17.455 --> 00:13:18.930
Hey. your mom always this mad?

374
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.210
Excuse me?

375
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.547
How about you stay out of my
business and cut some hair.

376
00:13:23.547 --> 00:13:26.130
I wouldn't be in your business
if you weren't talking so loud.

377
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.830
So what?

378
00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:28.970
OK. mom. relax.

379
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.340
You too fine to be letting
some dude stress you out.

380
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.140
You know you're supposed to
have your holes in control.

381
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.223
And you don't even know
what you're talking about.

382
00:13:35.223 --> 00:13:37.190
How about you cut some hair?

383
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.480
I am.

384
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.070
But part of my job
is to also make

385
00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.570
sure that everybody that
walk through that door.

386
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.810
they walk out with a
smile in their experience.

387
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:45.762
I'm cutting his hair.

388
00:13:45.762 --> 00:13:46.970
Ain't that right. little man?

389
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:49.990
All right.

390
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.334
I mean-- now. to just
work on you. Miss--

391
00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.730
Jasmine.

392
00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:58.880
And you are?

393
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.140
I'm Reggie.

394
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.940
Nice to finally meet you.

395
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.363
Nice to meet you too.

396
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.343
See. that wasn't
so hard. was it?

397
00:14:07.343 --> 00:14:09.260
Oh. you're going to hit
me with the shoulders.

398
00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.300
I see that's a
hereditary thing. huh?

399
00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.000
OK. Reggie.

400
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.950
So how long you
been cutting hair?

401
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.070
Uh. it's about three. four--

402
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.600
Oh. so about three
or four years?

403
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.410
Days.

404
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.922
Days.

405
00:14:21.922 --> 00:14:23.630
I got my certification
earlier this week.

406
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:24.550
Wait. what's today?

407
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.800
Tuesday. Thursday.

408
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.580
I'm joking.

409
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.210
I'm joking.

410
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.420
I've been cutting six years.

411
00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.580
Oh.

412
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.080
I was gonna say.

413
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.710
Oh. you real funny. huh?

414
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.210
You know.

415
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:35.980
Just a little jokey-joke.

416
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.810
But what's up with you
and that phone call?

417
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.780
You too fine to be letting
whatever do stress you out.

418
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.390
Look. I'm damn near
30. and I don't

419
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.330
want my son to keep
seeing me single out here.

420
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.980
You know?

421
00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.730
I want him to be in a stable
home with two parents.

422
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.110
You know. like the old days.

423
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.310
Hmph.

424
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.240
I feel you.

425
00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.160
It's just one thing
you're missing. though.

426
00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.150
What's that?

427
00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.490
Them old days. they old as hell.

428
00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:01.120
They're gone.

429
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.550
You can go searching
for them if you want.

430
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:04.820
They're not here no more.

431
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.737
And how you know that?

432
00:15:05.737 --> 00:15:07.612
Because that special
thing you searching for.

433
00:15:07.612 --> 00:15:08.650
it don't exist no more.

434
00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.050
Back in the day. women used to
cook. clean. raise the babies.

435
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.630
That's what women
were taught to do.

436
00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:17.320
Is that really what you
want out of your life?

437
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.090
What's so bad about that?

438
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:20.770
I mean. absolutely nothing.

439
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.850
Ain't nothing wrong with it.
but a woman as fine as you.

440
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.900
I just feel like you
deserve more than just

441
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.550
being cooped up in the house.

442
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:32.700
Do you want your entire dream
to belong to somebody else?

443
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.422
I still want a man in my life.

444
00:15:35.422 --> 00:15:37.130
I don't want my son
seeing me around here

445
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.161
with all these different guys.

446
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.990
But it's so bad out here.

447
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.765
I want to find someone
to make me happy.

448
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.080
I mean. I hear you. but
that's your problem.

449
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.660
You can't find happiness
in somebody else.

450
00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.390
Now. we all know. you've
got to find that within.

451
00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.270
Now. a guy. he can
make you smile.

452
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.120
He can even make you feel good.

453
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.640
But real happiness. it
always got to come within.

454
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.652
Come on. now.

455
00:16:06.652 --> 00:16:07.860
Ain't that right. little man?

456
00:16:10.746 --> 00:16:11.710
Mm.

457
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.330
Wow!

458
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.130
That look nice.

459
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.553
OK. I see you.

460
00:16:16.553 --> 00:16:18.970
And it don't have that little
painted black shit on there.

461
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:19.510
OK.

462
00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.810
Thank you. Reggie.

463
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:21.670
Oh.

464
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.640
So. son. how do you
like your haircut?

465
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.770
Man. I want to be as
unbothered as him.

466
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:27.574
Pssh.

467
00:16:27.574 --> 00:16:28.780
Oh.

468
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.490
OK. how much?

469
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.280
Oh. I normally do $20.

470
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.480
But. for you-- for you.
I'm going to do a dub.

471
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.450
Oh. I see you got a little
jokey-jokes too. huh?

472
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.110
OK.

473
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.810
Well. here you go.

474
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.181
Keep the change.

475
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.700
Got a little jokey-joke.

476
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:49.390
Nice play.

477
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.410
So. Reggie. do you have a
business card or anything where

478
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:59.310
I can make an appointment
or call to get some advice?

479
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.890
I like the way you think.

480
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.090
For sure.

481
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.800
Thank you.

482
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.906
All right. son. let's go.

483
00:17:05.906 --> 00:17:07.220
Bye. Reggie.

484
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.001
All right. Jasmine.

485
00:17:09.001 --> 00:17:11.737
Mm.

486
00:17:11.737 --> 00:17:13.670
She was fine as hell.

487
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.096
Whoo!

488
00:17:15.096 --> 00:17:16.587
Mm.

489
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.520
Hey. what's up?

490
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.480
I'm glad you could
finally make it.

491
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.222
Yeah. my bad.

492
00:17:44.222 --> 00:17:46.680
You know. it's a little crazy
getting to this side of town.

493
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.580
Traffic was wild.

494
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.330
But let me see you.

495
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.728
Check you out.

496
00:17:50.728 --> 00:17:51.270
Come on. now.

497
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.090
Give me a hug.

498
00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:52.590
Mm-hmm.

499
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.660
So tell me. how was your day?

500
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.950
Damn.

501
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.030
Where do I start?

502
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.568
OK. so I had this weird
couple come in. right?

503
00:18:02.568 --> 00:18:04.860
And let me tell you. the
girl. I mean. she was stacked.

504
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.140
She had big titties.
a big booty.

505
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.190
She was bad.

506
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.460
By her husband. I'm
talking like some Screech.

507
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.630
kind of a Urkel dude.

508
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.130
He tape all in the
glasses and everything.

509
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.710
I'm not the problem here. OK?

510
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:22.100
She's the one who needs
your professional guidance.

511
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.310
I can't deal with her
self-effacing. insecure

512
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.600
behavior.

513
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.400
Besides. it's out of my control.

514
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.510
I mean. I can't keep
these women off of me.

515
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.783
It's true.

516
00:18:33.783 --> 00:18:35.450
I mean. everywhere
we go. women are just

517
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.910
throwing themselves at him.

518
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.627
And I can't deal.

519
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.180
So what we're dealing with is
a classic case of insecurities.

520
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.160
Yet. this isn't so common.

521
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.610
How would you say your personal
life is between you two?

522
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.370
Oh. you mean like
when we're alone?

523
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.810
Everything's great.

524
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.490
We have fun.

525
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.230
We go places.

526
00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:00.530
And he does this
thing with his tongue

527
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.030
when I'm bent over the bed.

528
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.170
Oh. yeah.

529
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.670
So by the time he pulls out--

530
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.080
Whoa. not that.

531
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.642
I was just asking how you
two felt about one another.

532
00:19:08.642 --> 00:19:10.850
I thought that we could talk
to you about everything?

533
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.540
That is what we're
paying you for. right?

534
00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.380
Right. babe?

535
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.790
That's right. my darling.

536
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:22.400
She is 100% unequivocally
correctamundo. Miss Hampton.

537
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.197
Know know what?

538
00:19:23.197 --> 00:19:23.780
You know what?

539
00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.580
You're right. Mr.
And Mrs. Cooper.

540
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.930
I apologize.

541
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.090
Please feel free to
share any information

542
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.770
you feel to be pertinent.

543
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.550
Oh. no.

544
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.300
Who "Pertinent"?

545
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.580
And where he from?

546
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.150
Pertinent means important.
my little ray of sunshine.

547
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.760
Oh.

548
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.770
OK. important.

549
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:40.370
OK.

550
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.700
Yeah. well. in
all my years. I've

551
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:49.520
never met someone who makes
me feel like this man does.

552
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.920
I just feel like I'm
not enough for him.

553
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.040
And I feel like he's
going to leave me

554
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.360
for one of these little thots.

555
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.580
Oh. cut the malarkey.

556
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.200
I've been with you
this whole time.

557
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.030
These whoremongers.
they mean nothing to me.

558
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.430
I mean. sure.

559
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.260
The woman at the
gas station register

560
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.250
always offers me some quick
fellatio. but I just say no.

561
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.370
Just $20 on pump six. please.

562
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.100
Or at the clothing store. when
the girl invited me to the back

563
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.090
to "paint her face."

564
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:18.590
Huh.

565
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.570
I said. I'm not even an artist.

566
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.760
What does that mean?

567
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.440
See?

568
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.070
OK.

569
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.060
OK. Mr. Cooper.

570
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.750
So have you ever engaged
in any sexual activity

571
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.100
with any of these women?

572
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.260
Absolutely not.

573
00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.410
What in the world would
give you any inclination

574
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.595
that they want to have
sexual intercourse with me?

575
00:20:40.595 --> 00:20:42.920
You silly therapist.

576
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.070
I just don't know what to do.

577
00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:48.740
Look. look.

578
00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.600
What I've learned today is--

579
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.230
I don't know.

580
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:57.265
The crazy thing about it is she
was kind of obsessed with him.

581
00:20:57.265 --> 00:20:58.630
You know?

582
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.643
Hmm?

583
00:20:59.643 --> 00:21:00.310
So let me guess.

584
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.530
That kind of threw
you off a little bit.

585
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.240
Let me break
something down to you.

586
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.350
Hey. how are y'all doing?

587
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.555
Ma'am. did you bring
your son in here today?

588
00:21:07.555 --> 00:21:08.230
Ah!

589
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.330
I knew I should have
left him in the car.

590
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.080
Girls are afraid to
date good looking guys

591
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.913
because they don't want
to get dumped or get

592
00:21:13.913 --> 00:21:14.710
their heart broken.

593
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.620
Number two. good
looking women. they

594
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.800
also got their insecurities
and. you know. they hide them.

595
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.130
That's usually how that goes.

596
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.610
Now. three. this is
the kicker right here.

597
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.770
Now. it's apparent he
got her mind confused.

598
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.470
What she can't detect.
she can't reject.

599
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.420
And when a woman's
mind is confused.

600
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.350
she's easy to control.

601
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.850
Wow.

602
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:34.660
OK. OK. OK.

603
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.970
So. Casanova. is that your
strategy for everything?

604
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:37.850
Is that what it is?

605
00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:38.650
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

606
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.230
I don't use strategies.

607
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.600
If you want anything
genuine. you can never

608
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.198
attack it using a "strategy."

609
00:21:45.198 --> 00:21:46.990
So what you're saying
is that you can never

610
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.610
treat two people the same way?

611
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:49.787
Not exactly.

612
00:21:49.787 --> 00:21:52.120
Because in life. you're going
to always encounter people

613
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.780
with similar situations.

614
00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.475
But what I'm saying
is. I never go

615
00:21:55.475 --> 00:21:57.850
into a situation knowing how
I'm going to treat somebody.

616
00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.450
That shit almost never works.

617
00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.870
It always backfires.

618
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.820
So how do you think
you need to treat me?

619
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.230
Like a woman that likes me.

620
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.530
But because of her
past. she's wounded.

621
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.880
Guards up.

622
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.050
It's understandable.

623
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.180
You're also an
independent woman who

624
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:17.380
don't need a man for
nothing until it's time

625
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.690
to put some salt on
that butt naked pretzel.

626
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.480
Wow.

627
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.910
I'm so tired of this man
thinking he know everything.

628
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:25.690
But you know what?

629
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:26.440
He might be right.

630
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.148
I ain't going to let
him know. all right?

631
00:22:28.148 --> 00:22:28.790
You know what?

632
00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.910
I don't need a man for sex. OK?

633
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.220
Matter of fact. I
don't need anybody.

634
00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.550
Well. excuse me.
Miss Independent.

635
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:37.240
Huh.

636
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.800
You must know how
to DJ real good.

637
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.300
Huh?

638
00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:40.960
Nothing.

639
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.877
Do you need something?

640
00:22:41.877 --> 00:22:42.430
We're closed.

641
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:42.970
She's not calling you. though.

642
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:43.840
We are closed.

643
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.440
We're closed.

644
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.160
We just got here.

645
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:45.660
Exactly.

646
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.880
We closed from here all
the way to here. OK?

647
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.630
We just got here.

648
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:50.830
You definitely are
not getting a tip.

649
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:51.330
Yeah.

650
00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.230
Can I just get a margarita?

651
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.510
Anyway. how was your day. man?

652
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.242
I actually had a
very. very good day.

653
00:22:57.242 --> 00:22:58.450
It was a typical day. though.

654
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.030
I had this client. she
came in with her son.

655
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.490
Now. she was in a bad mood.

656
00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.440
But once I. you know.
gave her a few smiles.

657
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.840
told her a few jokes. she
actually opened up to me.

658
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.850
It kind of reminded me
of this girl I know.

659
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:13.360
I met her at a bar one time.
but I cannot remember her name.

660
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.430
Really?

661
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:16.000
OK. so what?

662
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.940
Did you get her number too?

663
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.487
Of course I did.

664
00:23:20.487 --> 00:23:21.070
You know what?

665
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.360
Mm. you just typical.

666
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.910
Just like typical kind of
man. you know what I mean?

667
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.740
I was joking.

668
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.180
No. I didn't get her number.

669
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.522
She's a client.

670
00:23:29.522 --> 00:23:31.855
I gave her my business card.
but why is that so typical?

671
00:23:31.855 --> 00:23:32.620
You know what?

672
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.960
The more I get to know you.
the more typical you are.

673
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.777
Just player.

674
00:23:35.777 --> 00:23:36.610
That's what you are.

675
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:37.420
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

676
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.580
I'm not a player at all.

677
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.870
I'm not here to play games.

678
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:43.840
I'm always open. honest.
and upfront about mine.

679
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.090
So how did you even
come to that conclusion?

680
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.730
Never mind. OK?

681
00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.800
But it's kind of
funny. because while I

682
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.230
was talking to the client
today. and. you know.

683
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:54.790
I'm shedding light
on her situation

684
00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:57.623
and giving her a new
perspective. I sat there

685
00:23:57.623 --> 00:23:59.290
and I was like. I
can't wait to tell you

686
00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.640
because I was kind of like
doing your job a little bit.

687
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.140
OK.

688
00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.662
One. you can never do my job.

689
00:24:03.662 --> 00:24:05.620
You don't have the formal
training or the hours

690
00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.730
that I put into this.

691
00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.080
So let me get this straight.

692
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.500
Just because you went to school
and studied all these hours.

693
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.930
that means you better
at this than me?

694
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.042
Yeah. exactly.

695
00:24:15.042 --> 00:24:16.000
That's what I'm saying.

696
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.470
OK.

697
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.630
Well. you know what
I got to say to that?

698
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.470
Fuck them books. and
fuck that degree.

699
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.350
Pssh.

700
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.890
There is no better teacher
than life and its experiences.

701
00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:29.720
What you. like $100.000 in debt?

702
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.730
Girl. please.

703
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:31.600
OK. excuse me?

704
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.190
You are a barber. OK?

705
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.020
You can never shit on my career.

706
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.960
Can never try to do what I
do. so don't even try me.

707
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.230
So I didn't have to work just
as hard to get where I am?

708
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.070
Yeah. OK.

709
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:44.830
Um. Paul. why don't you
go ahead and close us out.

710
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.850
Pssh.

711
00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.270
Yeah. and don't worry about it.

712
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.100
It's on me since I know you
got them loans to pay back.

713
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:51.940
Huh.

714
00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.950
Enjoy. Miss Therapist.

715
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:57.160
She don't think that I can
do her job better than her.

716
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.330
Shit.

717
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.196
Watch me.

718
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.230
So Reggie. I heard you over
at the bar the other night

719
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.272
saying that you was giving
that good therapy. yo.

720
00:25:22.272 --> 00:25:24.540
So I figured I'd come over
here and check you out.

721
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.840
Girl. we're in a barbershop.

722
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.400
I mean. babe. just
give it a shot.

723
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.730
We need full discretion.

724
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.320
Just like-- this can't leave
the barbershop. please.

725
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.130
Of course.

726
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.200
So what's going on with y'all?

727
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.140
So. so. me and baby's been
together for about 10 months.

728
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.230
and she's just not giving what
I thought she was going to give.

729
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.772
I thought she was going to be
doing a little bit more of the.

730
00:25:43.772 --> 00:25:46.912
you know. taking the trash out.
maybe going to get the car.

731
00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:48.370
She's falling off
a little bit when

732
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.973
it comes to playing that role.

733
00:25:50.973 --> 00:25:53.140
You do realize I have a
vagina just like you. right?

734
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.370
I mean. yeah babe. so?

735
00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.078
So what I need to take
the trash out for?

736
00:25:56.078 --> 00:25:58.037
She was giving that when
we first got together.

737
00:25:58.037 --> 00:26:00.460
and I'm just trying to figure
out what is really going on.

738
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.030
OK.

739
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:01.530
OK.

740
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:07.210
I see the problem here is.
there's no masculine energy

741
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:08.950
kind of present. huh?

742
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:09.670
I mean.

743
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:10.900
No.

744
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.580
But what is missing
is the fact that you

745
00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.380
don't cook. clean or listen.

746
00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.550
I listen.

747
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:16.690
When do you listen?

748
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.160
This morning.

749
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.050
And that's the only
time you do listen.

750
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.050
is when somebody's
trying to bang you over.

751
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.220
This is what I mean.

752
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.220
What are we going to do?

753
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.450
OK.

754
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:33.640
Well. let me propose this.
you know. hear me out.

755
00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.450
We create a list of things
for you to do. a list for you

756
00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:38.090
to do.

757
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:40.240
And then we make a third
column of list of things

758
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.490
that I'm going to come over
and do. you understand me?

759
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.280
Because I think the whole
problem is y'all are not

760
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:45.910
balanced.

761
00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.610
Even look at how y'all sitting.
that's not a balanced equation

762
00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:49.902
right there. you understand me?

763
00:26:49.902 --> 00:26:52.510
Put somebody like me in
there. insert myself.

764
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:53.500
we can get it going.

765
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:59.090
Because y'all just need some
structure Key word. struc-ture.

766
00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:01.160
All right. come on now. come on.

767
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.477
Thank you. Reggie.

768
00:27:02.477 --> 00:27:03.290
Thank you. Reggie.

769
00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:03.790
I know.

770
00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:04.670
Put it here.

771
00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:05.980
There we go.

772
00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.702
Amen.

773
00:27:07.702 --> 00:27:09.160
See y'all later to
pick up that a--

774
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.660
I mean. take out the
trash. take out the trash.

775
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.030
Man. I'm good at this shit.

776
00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:14.770
Come on now.

777
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.250
Check my next appointment.

778
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.750
OK.

779
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:22.600
So. what brings
you guys in here?

780
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.450
Well. honestly. I don't
know why we're here.

781
00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:28.840
I don't feel like we need
to be seeing you. Mrs Stacy.

782
00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.300
I feel like it's pointless.

783
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.990
But for some reason he wants
me to be here. because he

784
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:37.220
think it'll help our situation.

785
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.580
So maybe he can tell
you how the list went.

786
00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.180
OK.

787
00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.820
So. why don't you
tell me how you

788
00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.680
feel about things right now?

789
00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.740
As you can see. there's
a bit of resistance.

790
00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:52.600
And I feel we need
a third party.

791
00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.170
OK?

792
00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.680
Because we're not
getting anywhere.

793
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.440
So you don't think
there's anything that

794
00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.720
can improve your situation?

795
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.640
Better sex. that's
another thing.

796
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.740
Oh. this is new.

797
00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:03.790
Yeah. that is new.

798
00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.050
But I just feel like
it needs to be better.

799
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:09.400
I feel like you don't
cook the best food either.

800
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.960
while we're at it.

801
00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.540
And you don't like to clean.
and you don't give good sex.

802
00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.690
So I mean-- why am
I here. Dr. Stacy?

803
00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:17.810
Can I go?

804
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:18.580
You know what?

805
00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.440
No. no. our time's not up yet.

806
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.690
What is up. is
this relationship.

807
00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:24.397
I ain't gay no more.

808
00:28:24.397 --> 00:28:26.230
Matter of fact. I'm
finna go get me a bitch.

809
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.020
I'm going to head down to
Magic City and throw some ones.

810
00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.030
You can have this shit.

811
00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:32.093
Thank you.

812
00:28:32.093 --> 00:28:33.260
You can send me the invoice.

813
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.150
You can figure it out.

814
00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:34.660
I'm out.

815
00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.190
Figure your life out. honey.

816
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.685
Fuck this person.

817
00:28:38.685 --> 00:28:40.060
Shot. he done left
his purse. I'm

818
00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.643
going to take his
motherfucking money.

819
00:28:41.643 --> 00:28:43.210
Oh. I need my wallet.

820
00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.040
All right. so what
seem to be the problem?

821
00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.100
Look man. she been
this way. right?

822
00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.110
Her people got that shit.

823
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.255
And she won't give me the plug.

824
00:28:55.255 --> 00:28:56.380
What are you talking about?

825
00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.480
We gave you a pound last
month and you smoked it

826
00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.870
all by yourself.

827
00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:01.600
Man. I roll that
shit up so the homies

828
00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.540
knew it was that gas. baby.
that was all I was doing.

829
00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.240
What are you talking about.
it was you that smoked it all.

830
00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.200
It was me?

831
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.200
You see what I'm saying?

832
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:09.730
Right.

833
00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.555
Just real quick. just
for my own knowledge.

834
00:29:11.555 --> 00:29:13.930
when we talk about that shit.
we talking about that shit.

835
00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:15.010
We're not here for that.

836
00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.540
You're right. you're right.

837
00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.590
So what are we here for?

838
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:18.430
Because you.

839
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.940
Look at you.

840
00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:19.660
You don't even get up.

841
00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.910
You ain't even being a
gentleman...

842
00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:22.810
Oh.

843
00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:23.548
Let me sit down.

844
00:29:23.548 --> 00:29:24.340
You're right. baby.

845
00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.390
You're right. you're
right. you're right.

846
00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:26.080
I'm sorry.

847
00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.030
What I'm getting is. you
like to be in control.

848
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.580
But I like when she in control.

849
00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.030
Maybe.

850
00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:33.280
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

851
00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.200
I mean. if you
like it. I love it.

852
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:35.748
If--

853
00:29:35.748 --> 00:29:36.790
I mean. you cool with it?

854
00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:37.540
You like it?

855
00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.490
I love it. baby.

856
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:38.990
Come on.

857
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.950
OK.

858
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.488
Maybe y'all should
say it together.

859
00:29:43.488 --> 00:29:45.280
I think y'all should
continue on that path.

860
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:50.020
And every now and then. give
him a pound. hold him down.

861
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.720
Listen to the therapist. baby.
that's what we came here for.

862
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.022
OK.

863
00:29:54.022 --> 00:29:55.440
Try it out.

864
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.230
All right.

865
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.280
Come on.

866
00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.070
Don't be like that.

867
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.870
Out here saving relationships
one couple at a time.

868
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:03.640
I love it.

869
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.660
Woo.

870
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.060
So Coffee. share with me
why you're here today.

871
00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.930
When I don't have
sex. I get anxiety.

872
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:18.680
And I started listening to
this new podcast about sex.

873
00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.380
I'm not getting nothing.
I'm not getting shit.

874
00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.240
So what do you
think the reason is?

875
00:30:27.602 --> 00:30:28.310
You want a glass?

876
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.840
I got another glass?

877
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.620
I'm having-- OK. so.

878
00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.810
So have you shared
this with your fiancee?

879
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.520
How does he feel?

880
00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.930
He thinks that sex
once a week is OK.

881
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.290
He thinks that's healthy.

882
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:47.060
I'm like. all day.
everyday. bro.

883
00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.370
Let's just find other
ways to counter this.

884
00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:52.190
OK.

885
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:53.970
OK.

886
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:54.470
OK.

887
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:57.710
So you're saying I should
go and pay for sex.

888
00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:02.600
I should go down to the West End
and get some broke nigga Dick.

889
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.260
No. no. I didn't say
that. I didn't say that.

890
00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.720
That's exactly what
I'm going to do.

891
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.070
I'm going to do that.

892
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:11.090
I'm doing it.

893
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.850
And on the way there I'm
going to listen to that show.

894
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.730
And listen to it. it's
going to ignite my inner ho.

895
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:17.690
What show?

896
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:20.060
It's called Cocktales.
Dirty Discussions.

897
00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:23.210
C-O-C-K-T-A-L-E-S.
Dirty Discussions.

898
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:24.830
And I'm going to go get dirty.

899
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.110
Your time is almost up.

900
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:32.130
But one more thing. have you
ever thought about celibacy?

901
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:50.170
Yo. we closed.

902
00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:51.700
I ain't never said
nothing like that

903
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.370
to you when you came to my
bar in that late night shit.

904
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.620
Yo. Paul. what you doing
on this side of town?

905
00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.167
I'm always on this
side of town. man.

906
00:31:58.167 --> 00:31:58.750
What you mean?

907
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.910
I was around the corner. it's
getting a little line up.

908
00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:02.243
he kind of didn't do a good job.

909
00:32:02.243 --> 00:32:05.020
So I was just wondering if
you had enough time to get me

910
00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:06.070
in for a little quickie?

911
00:32:09.037 --> 00:32:09.620
You know what?

912
00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:10.120
I got you.

913
00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:10.640
Come on.

914
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.860
My boy.

915
00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.230
Come on.

916
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:16.370
I'll get you right.

917
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:18.860
Yes Sir.

918
00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.670
I don't know what's wrong
with that other barber. man.

919
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:22.310
Drive me crazy.

920
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.425
Let me take this off
for you real quick.

921
00:32:24.425 --> 00:32:27.190
Yeah. peel that thing back.

922
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:28.068
Yeah.

923
00:32:28.068 --> 00:32:28.610
There you go.

924
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:34.190
Oh. OK.

925
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:36.050
What you want me
to do with this?

926
00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.630
Oh. can you do the
number one on the side?

927
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.970
And then like the number
two a little bit higher?

928
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.933
And then just give me
the three up top. OK?

929
00:32:43.933 --> 00:32:45.350
Oh. and can you
give me that part.

930
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.892
you know. that part
that LeBron James

931
00:32:46.892 --> 00:32:49.770
be having. but don't give me
the extra LeBron James sauce.

932
00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.270
Because I want my
hair to grow back.

933
00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:51.770
Yeah.

934
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:52.762
Just box shave it up.

935
00:32:52.762 --> 00:32:53.720
We're going to be good.

936
00:32:57.664 --> 00:32:59.636
Uh.

937
00:32:59.636 --> 00:33:01.543
So.

938
00:33:01.543 --> 00:33:03.430
Um.

939
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.600
So. How everything
going with you. big dog?

940
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.850
What's going on?

941
00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.260
Oh. besides the cut?

942
00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.520
Oh. you know. I mean my--

943
00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.645
I mean. we're having a
little trouble at the house.

944
00:33:11.645 --> 00:33:12.440
that's all.

945
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.450
Aren't you experienced?

946
00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.610
You experience with
the ladies. right?

947
00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.290
Yeah. yeah. yeah. you know. I
do my thing from time to time.

948
00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:19.590
What's up?

949
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:21.190
Oh. you know. me
and my girl. we've

950
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.607
just been kind of having little
problems lately. you know?

951
00:33:23.607 --> 00:33:25.715
I feel like every time I
try to do better. I fail.

952
00:33:25.715 --> 00:33:26.590
you know what I mean?

953
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.680
When I try to bring
us closer. it just

954
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.190
doesn't work out the way I think
it's going to work out. man.

955
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.168
Paul. you're not saying nothing.

956
00:33:35.168 --> 00:33:37.210
How are you going to get
my genuine advice if you

957
00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.540
ain't being honest with me?

958
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.330
Come on. man.

959
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.880
Nah. nah. I'm not--

960
00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.330
I'm good. man.

961
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:45.250
I'm good.

962
00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:46.480
Paul.

963
00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.850
Talk to me.

964
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.490
She think I'm smashing Tina.

965
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:53.270
You're not?

966
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.807
No.

967
00:33:54.807 --> 00:33:57.140
I mean. I'm just saying. I
hit that at least three times

968
00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.350
by now. but--

969
00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.850
Yeah.

970
00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.890
OK. no. I wouldn't. I wouldn't.

971
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:02.630
But. the owner would get upset.

972
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:04.790
I mean. at least one of
them would get upset.

973
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.560
Yeah. Yeah. for sure.

974
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.340
But. OK.

975
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.960
Be real with me.

976
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.550
You ain't give her cause to
question your relationship.

977
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.510
Listen. man.

978
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.659
Tina is my most
trusted employee. OK?

979
00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:19.400
She knows almost everything--

980
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.500
I can't even run that
place without her.

981
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.159
You know. I talk
to her every day.

982
00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:27.020
We really built up this
genuine good friendship. man.

983
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.989
And I've never smashed her.

984
00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:30.739
I could see you looking
at me. I feel you.

985
00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:32.960
I could feel the stank
in your eyes. OK.

986
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.113
Close your eyes when
you're looking at me. OK?

987
00:34:36.113 --> 00:34:38.030
But let me tell you what
really happened. man.

988
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.610
Carlene came in there
one day and me and Tina

989
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.880
was me and Tinaing.
you know what I mean.

990
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.190
And she kind of ain't
like that and we've

991
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:47.929
been downhill ever since.

992
00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:48.739
All right.

993
00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:50.719
How about this. this
the best I can do.

994
00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:54.920
How about you. me. and
Carlene. we sit down

995
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.389
and we figure this thing out.

996
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:58.550
You know. she really
understands your relationship.

997
00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:00.690
That's the best
I can do for you.

998
00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:01.640
I can do that.

999
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.630
I can do that. man.

1000
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.875
Thank you. Reggie.

1001
00:35:03.875 --> 00:35:05.000
Well I appreciate you. man.

1002
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.708
Let me go ahead and
look at this haircut.

1003
00:35:06.708 --> 00:35:07.760
No. no. no. no. you good.

1004
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.560
I'm trying to look at the--

1005
00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.143
You know what?

1006
00:35:09.143 --> 00:35:09.690
No.

1007
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.040
I'm grabbing--

1008
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.950
No. you're good. you're good.

1009
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:13.600
No. no. no--

1010
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.210
OK. OK.

1011
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.960
Because we closed.

1012
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.973
OK. we closed.

1013
00:35:15.973 --> 00:35:16.640
Yeah. we closed.

1014
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.667
OK. all right.

1015
00:35:17.667 --> 00:35:18.750
I can't just look at the--

1016
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:19.500
No. no. no. no.

1017
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.000
OK.

1018
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.510
I'm good?

1019
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:21.200
We closed.

1020
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.040
All right. OK.

1021
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:22.952
All right. cool.

1022
00:35:22.952 --> 00:35:23.660
I appreciate you.

1023
00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.670
Go ahead. get up out of here.

1024
00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:25.840
Yeah. you sure you
don't want the--

1025
00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.470
No. no. no. no. you know
what. you take that.

1026
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:28.303
That's on the house.

1027
00:35:28.303 --> 00:35:28.886
All right. OK.

1028
00:35:28.886 --> 00:35:29.636
It's on the house.

1029
00:35:29.636 --> 00:35:30.170
Yep.

1030
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.354
House cuts on the house.

1031
00:35:32.354 --> 00:35:33.688
Hmm.

1032
00:35:33.688 --> 00:35:34.730
I don't know how do you--

1033
00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:39.793
Shit crazy as hell.

1034
00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:51.490
Hey girl. how you been?

1035
00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:52.430
Long time no see.

1036
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:53.900
I miss you.

1037
00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.358
I know. it's been a while.

1038
00:35:56.358 --> 00:35:57.900
Well. you know how
he is.

1039
00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.350
Well. was.

1040
00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:00.745
What's what?

1041
00:36:00.745 --> 00:36:03.370
I think we done
this time. friend.

1042
00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:04.210
Oh. my God.

1043
00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.320
That's so sad.

1044
00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.640
What?

1045
00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.200
Yeah girl.

1046
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.105
You know what's so crazy though?

1047
00:36:10.105 --> 00:36:11.980
I thought I was going
to be a little bit more

1048
00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:16.870
hurt. but this time--

1049
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:18.100
But what?

1050
00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.830
Lord what?

1051
00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:21.410
OK.

1052
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:21.910
OK.

1053
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:22.900
So listen.

1054
00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.690
I took little Mike to
get his hair cut. right?

1055
00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:29.245
And this Barber was
at his business.

1056
00:36:29.245 --> 00:36:31.120
But he was like telling
me how I shouldn't be

1057
00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.950
looking for happiness in a man.

1058
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:40.040
And I don't know why. but
that's just stuck in my head.

1059
00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.790
And like--

1060
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:43.690
Well--

1061
00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:47.440
It was just so. the
conversation was just so deep.

1062
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.940
Well. he's absolutely right.

1063
00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:53.120
I mean. you do need to
find happiness within.

1064
00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.745
But. that's the same
thing Reggie said.

1065
00:37:00.862 --> 00:37:03.300
You there. bitch?

1066
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:03.960
Yeah. I'm good.

1067
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.800
I'm good. I'm cool. cool.

1068
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.967
I just miss you. that's all.

1069
00:37:05.967 --> 00:37:06.690
Really miss you.

1070
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.650
We need to go ahead
and get together soon.

1071
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:12.300
Hell yeah.

1072
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.100
Oh. I'm going to pull
up to your office.

1073
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.515
The hell. I need me
some therapy myself.

1074
00:37:16.515 --> 00:37:18.060
Girl. you so silly.

1075
00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:18.630
All right.

1076
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.700
Well. look. I'll see
you later. all right?

1077
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.900
OK then.

1078
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.030
You sure you're all right?

1079
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.810
I'm good.

1080
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:26.700
yeah.

1081
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.010
love you.

1082
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.090
I don't know.

1083
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:33.360
Bye girl. I gotta
get out of here.

1084
00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:33.860
Bye.

1085
00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.010
So I asked the two
of you to come here

1086
00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:55.690
today because Paul
was telling me

1087
00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.230
that you guys are having some
issues in the relationship.

1088
00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:02.317
Carlene. Carlene. leaving
isn't going to solve anything.

1089
00:38:02.317 --> 00:38:03.400
So let's just talk it out.

1090
00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.930
Sure. Reggie.

1091
00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:09.160
Why not?

1092
00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:12.130
So how about you tell me what
issues you guys are having?

1093
00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:13.630
He's fucking the waitress.

1094
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:15.190
And I know you are.

1095
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:16.750
I mean. you've
seen that waitress.

1096
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:17.770
I'd be fucking her.

1097
00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:18.940
Baby I'm not fucking Tina.

1098
00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:19.990
Shut the fuck up. Paul.

1099
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.950
I heard you.

1100
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.320
I heard you tell her.
oh. I just don't know

1101
00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.693
what I'd do without you. Tina.

1102
00:38:24.693 --> 00:38:27.360
Just because she does good work.
she's my most trusted employee.

1103
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.630
Babe.

1104
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:31.170
Once you go black.
you don't go back.

1105
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.200
OK. OK.

1106
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.075
Let's just calm down.

1107
00:38:33.075 --> 00:38:33.908
There's no need to--

1108
00:38:33.908 --> 00:38:34.960
Shut the fuck up. Reggie.

1109
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.850
You just shut right
the fuck on up.

1110
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:38.590
You're not even a therapist.

1111
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:40.300
What is he doing here?

1112
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.200
You're right.

1113
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.550
I am not a real therapist.

1114
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.700
However. I have very
existential life experiences

1115
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:49.900
that allow me to weigh the
scale of good and bad and evil

1116
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:54.520
on the rhetorics of being
an existential human being

1117
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.800
with the symbiotic
form of our lives.

1118
00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.710
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1119
00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:02.390
I might not have a degree. but
I still think I can help y'all.

1120
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.890
How?

1121
00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:06.260
How can you help us?

1122
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:10.850
So why do you think he's
having an affair with Tina?

1123
00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:14.480
Paul likes all black things.

1124
00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:19.010
I make my stove top
stuffing. he wants dressing.

1125
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:23.360
I make shake and bake but
he wants real fried chicken.

1126
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.740
I make a pecan pie. he
wants sweet potato pie.

1127
00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:31.340
I throw on some
lovely soft rock.

1128
00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.590
he listens to some guy
called text the massage.

1129
00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:36.320
Text the message.

1130
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.140
Text. text him. really?

1131
00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.810
That guy is fine. but you
see where I'm coming from?

1132
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:42.880
Like. it's just so hard.

1133
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.610
OK.

1134
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:47.370
But. baby. baby. I love you. OK?

1135
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:50.030
I don't want anybody else.

1136
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.643
He got to love you.
because it's a whole hell

1137
00:39:52.643 --> 00:39:54.560
of a lot of fine ladies
that come in that bar.

1138
00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.102
He ain't got to just
settle for Tina.

1139
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:02.930
Really?

1140
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:04.190
My bad.

1141
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:05.540
What the fuck?

1142
00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.740
Carlene.

1143
00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:07.920
Carlene.

1144
00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.470
Why did God make me white?

1145
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:11.690
To bring about it. it was
the reverse psychology

1146
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:14.160
I think I was trying
to use as to--

1147
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.910
damn.

1148
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:17.775
Hate to see it.

1149
00:40:17.775 --> 00:40:19.400
Watch the mamma do
a little stanky leg.

1150
00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.740
do a little stanky leg.

1151
00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.250
I can do the stanky leg.

1152
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:22.950
Can you do it?

1153
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:23.900
What about this?

1154
00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.192
How about I twerk a little bit?

1155
00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:31.920
Ran the baby out.

1156
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:32.850
Look what you did.

1157
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.040
Hello?

1158
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.690
Hey. can you talk?

1159
00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:41.110
Why do I want to talk to you?

1160
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:42.750
I thought I had you blocked.

1161
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:44.760
Well I'm glad you didn't listen.

1162
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.760
I might have underestimated
the skill requirement

1163
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.000
to do your job effectively.

1164
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.130
What?

1165
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:55.470
I guess thank you.

1166
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.120
Come on. don't be like that.

1167
00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.490
Listen. I got myself in a
little bit of a situation.

1168
00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:02.230
And I think I might
need your help.

1169
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:04.170
You need my help?

1170
00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.680
What Mr Casanova?

1171
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.690
OK. I need to hear this.

1172
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:07.680
What?

1173
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.200
Look. I'm coming to you as
humbly as I possibly can.

1174
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.850
I need your help.

1175
00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:13.830
I got a job for you.

1176
00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:14.880
What kind of job?

1177
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.577
Well. I need you to go down
and meet this dude named Julio.

1178
00:41:17.577 --> 00:41:20.160
He down in this Swats. he going
to give you a brown paper bag.

1179
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.743
When he give you the brown paper
bag. don't look in it though.

1180
00:41:22.743 --> 00:41:24.090
Hell no. what the fuck?

1181
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:25.598
Are you serious?

1182
00:41:25.598 --> 00:41:26.640
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1183
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.890
No. no. no. I got
an emergency client

1184
00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:31.425
that probably needs to
come in and see with you.

1185
00:41:31.425 --> 00:41:32.880
You got time?

1186
00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.200
Who are the clients?

1187
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.190
God damn.

1188
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:37.080
You want the money or not.

1189
00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:37.580
Yeah.

1190
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.122
I mean. yeah.

1191
00:41:38.122 --> 00:41:39.028
Just what?

1192
00:41:39.028 --> 00:41:41.070
Tell them to meet me at
my office in the morning.

1193
00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:41.650
all right?

1194
00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:42.390
Oh. OK. OK.

1195
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:43.200
I can do that.

1196
00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.340
Hey. real quick.

1197
00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.510
What?

1198
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:48.428
You remember that butt
naked pretzel I had you in?

1199
00:41:48.428 --> 00:41:49.470
Get off my phone. Reggie.

1200
00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.080
Let me and auntie
talk for a second.

1201
00:42:00.573 --> 00:42:01.990
What are you going
to do with him?

1202
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.130
He is so cute.

1203
00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:04.846
Oh. Yes.

1204
00:42:04.846 --> 00:42:06.250
He getting so big. girl.

1205
00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:07.970
Yes girl.

1206
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:12.290
So. you going to tell me
what that was all about?

1207
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:13.480
It's just a friend of mine.

1208
00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.563
Got some clients he want
me to see in the morning.

1209
00:42:15.563 --> 00:42:17.140
No big deal.

1210
00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.040
That don't sound like no friend.

1211
00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.710
What was that. your boo?

1212
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:21.485
Hell no.

1213
00:42:21.485 --> 00:42:22.610
I mean. it could have been.

1214
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:26.800
But. he. I don't know.

1215
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.630
I see the same old Stacy.

1216
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.730
Nobody never good
enough for you.

1217
00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:35.770
You always cut them off when
you get a little too close.

1218
00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:40.480
Look. it ain't
nothing all right?

1219
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.440
So tell me bitch.

1220
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.170
Damn. bitch.

1221
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.390
Where's mine?

1222
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:54.805
I needed both of these.

1223
00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:56.180
Look. you know
that barber you've

1224
00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.390
been talking about Reggie?

1225
00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:01.010
That's who I was speaking to?

1226
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:03.180
Well. I knew it
was a coincidence

1227
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.650
when I saw his name on your
phone. but that's crazy.

1228
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.370
You mad at me?

1229
00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:09.830
Why the fuck would I be mad?

1230
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:11.827
Ain't like I'm fucking him.

1231
00:43:11.827 --> 00:43:13.910
I mean. I mean. I know you
was feeling him though.

1232
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:18.380
So that's why I just
didn't even say nothing.

1233
00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.450
Anyway.

1234
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:23.750
So let me ask you something.

1235
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.315
Did he put you in that
butt naked pretzel. now?

1236
00:43:26.315 --> 00:43:27.320
Shut up. girl.

1237
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.840
Eat the cheese with me. don't
make me eat it by myself.

1238
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.610
Here getting on my nerves.

1239
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:34.460
Oh now you want to share?

1240
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.570
Drinking up all
my goddamn liquor.

1241
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:37.490
Drink it with me.

1242
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:38.690
Come on.

1243
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:40.070
Yo. Paul.

1244
00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:41.480
You still here.

1245
00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.620
Hey. listen.

1246
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.420
I thought I was
something that I'm not.

1247
00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:45.350
That's on me.

1248
00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:46.280
Obviously.

1249
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.900
I mean. like what the fuck. man.

1250
00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.775
I thought you was actually
good at this shit.

1251
00:43:49.775 --> 00:43:51.380
Shit. me too. hell.

1252
00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.430
That's beside the point.

1253
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:53.000
Hey. look.

1254
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.710
I got you an appointment with a
real therapist tomorrow though.

1255
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:56.210
OK?

1256
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:57.710
Thanks.

1257
00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:00.910
You know. you uh. you do
therapy as good as you cut hair.

1258
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:05.080
OK. first off. I'm not good
at white therapy and whatever

1259
00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.370
type of hair that you got.

1260
00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.770
Now that I think about it.
you never actually paid--

1261
00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:10.610
I can't even make
Collard greens.

1262
00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.890
I'll wear Jordans for you. baby.

1263
00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:17.500
See?

1264
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:18.000
See?

1265
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.890
I got to go deal with her. OK?

1266
00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.770
I'm going to be at
that session tomorrow.

1267
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:24.480
And can you do me
a favor. please?

1268
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.920
Can you get out of my house?

1269
00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.390
You don't live here.

1270
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:28.512
OK. fine.

1271
00:44:28.512 --> 00:44:30.720
Hey. but let me talk to you
about that money. though.

1272
00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.190
Come be my therapist. baby.

1273
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.080
You who I'm sharing with. baby.

1274
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.520
Let me lay in your presence.

1275
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.050
Yes. it's so effortless. baby.

1276
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.350
Because you're so easy to talk
to. I often wish we was closer.

1277
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:41.970
Hope for the
sessions to bless us.

1278
00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:43.680
Yes. I might need to stay over.

1279
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.800
Hold in trauma from drama. now
I can't tell if they love me.

1280
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.770
But when we look for the
problem I always find out--

1281
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.020
So. Paul and Carlene.
how are you two doing

1282
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.550
since the last time we talked?

1283
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:55.050
Yep.

1284
00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:56.740
Things are going well.

1285
00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.825
We are so happy. so so happy.

1286
00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:02.590
OK.

1287
00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:05.050
Share with me some
of the positive news.

1288
00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:07.930
Oh. we're doing great.

1289
00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:11.230
I. for one. have been doing all
my affirmations in the mirror

1290
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:12.590
every single morning.

1291
00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:17.060
You know. I am beautiful.
I am sexy. I am thotty.

1292
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:20.530
I love that word. I've
never heard of before.

1293
00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:22.170
Like. what even does it mean?

1294
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:25.190
Well. I don't know. but I
feel thotty and I like it.

1295
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.690
Ooh.

1296
00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:27.580
So. Jamal. how does
that make you feel?

1297
00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:29.780
The fact that she's
feeling a little thotty?

1298
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:35.380
Happy wife. happy life.

1299
00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:38.030
Happy wife. happy life.

1300
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:39.075
Yeah.

1301
00:45:39.075 --> 00:45:40.360
So good.

1302
00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:43.930
I like it because saying I'm
thotty makes me feel smart.

1303
00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:46.750
Like I have good thoughts.

1304
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:48.580
I'm intellectual.

1305
00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.160
And he appreciates
me for my intellect.

1306
00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.080
And I know that I'm foine.

1307
00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.880
Because I went to the
gym the other day.

1308
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.220
and this like 60-year-old
guy was like hitting on me.

1309
00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:00.280
He said my ass
was P-H-A-T. phat.

1310
00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.500
So.

1311
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.700
Yeah. my baby got it.

1312
00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.840
My baby got it.

1313
00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.390
I do. I do.

1314
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:08.320
And how are you. babe?

1315
00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.410
I want to hear--

1316
00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:10.060
So. Paul.

1317
00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.185
What are some of the things
that you see in Carlene

1318
00:46:12.185 --> 00:46:13.930
that you absolutely adore?

1319
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:19.000
She's present.

1320
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.170
She's present. yeah.

1321
00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:22.930
She's. she's available.

1322
00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:23.830
Yes. I am.

1323
00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:27.520
She's always actively
there. you know.

1324
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.060
And--

1325
00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.346
Can't get rid of me.

1326
00:46:30.346 --> 00:46:32.560
Wow.

1327
00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.610
Yeah.

1328
00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:36.250
So have you seen any
positive changes in Jamal

1329
00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:40.100
that may be beneficial
to the relationship?

1330
00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:42.590
We're actually having
intercourse again.

1331
00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:46.800
Not all the way. because
I'm still pretty--

1332
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.230
No loosey goosey over here.

1333
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:49.730
No. No.

1334
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:50.360
Well.

1335
00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.963
I think in about six
months. we should

1336
00:46:51.963 --> 00:46:53.255
be able to fit the whole thing.

1337
00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:58.940
Well. I'm glad to
see you two are

1338
00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.730
working on those minor issues.

1339
00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:02.630
Yeah.

1340
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.994
Oh. well. it's a big issue
if you know what I mean.

1341
00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.600
Oh.

1342
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.580
So when we all
talked. you all said

1343
00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.033
you wanted to kind of buy
some things adventurous.

1344
00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:17.450
Things to do outside
of the house?

1345
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:19.010
How is that going?

1346
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:20.990
I took him camping.

1347
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:22.220
And he loved it.

1348
00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.390
White people games.

1349
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:24.440
I'm telling you.

1350
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.460
Got to love them.

1351
00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.300
Got to love them.

1352
00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:27.710
I love white people games.

1353
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:29.970
White people not so much.
but the games are fun.

1354
00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:30.470
Yeah.

1355
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:32.000
Yahtzee is a good one.

1356
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:32.790
No.

1357
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:33.290
OK.

1358
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:34.250
That sounds good.

1359
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:36.060
So we're making progress there.

1360
00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:36.560
OK.

1361
00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.810
So let's get to the main issue.

1362
00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:40.970
The bartender.

1363
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:43.550
I know you had an issue
with their relationship.

1364
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:45.260
So how's that going?

1365
00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.360
Friendship is what we say now.

1366
00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.420
It's not a relationship.
it's a friendship.

1367
00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.320
And she's nice.

1368
00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.930
She's very beautiful.

1369
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:55.940
She's very sweet.

1370
00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.390
But. I mean. she's gay.

1371
00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:02.060
So I guess I didn't have
anything to worry about.

1372
00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.107
OK. so that's good.

1373
00:48:03.107 --> 00:48:04.940
So we've come to the
conclusion that there's

1374
00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:08.060
really nothing to worry about
pertaining their friendship.

1375
00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.440
Yeah. you're just
friends. right?

1376
00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:10.340
You're just friends
with her. right?

1377
00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:10.860
Absolutely.

1378
00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:12.777
You're just ever going
to be friends. forever.

1379
00:48:12.777 --> 00:48:13.490
Absolutely.

1380
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.540
Yeah. Tina is ugly. she is ugly.

1381
00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:16.040
I wouldn't--

1382
00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.450
Don't say that about a woman.

1383
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:20.570
She's beautiful. but
you love me. obviously.

1384
00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:21.390
Yeah.

1385
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.890
Right?

1386
00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:22.430
Yeah.

1387
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:23.610
Yeah.

1388
00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:24.110
Yeah.

1389
00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:24.610
Yeah.

1390
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:28.670
He loves me. and I
am fucking hot. so.

1391
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:29.600
You are.

1392
00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.000
You are amazing.

1393
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.170
Oh my God. thank you.

1394
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:34.640
I have gotten nothing done.

1395
00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.400
It's just me being
fucking awesome.

1396
00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.390
Thank you.

1397
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:40.560
Thank you for the affirmations.

1398
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:41.060
OK.

1399
00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.590
So it looks like
our time is over.

1400
00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:45.650
Any last words. Paul. Carlene?

1401
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:46.730
I would.

1402
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:47.270
What do you?

1403
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:48.440
Did you?

1404
00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.550
Oh.

1405
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:51.110
Just your hair.

1406
00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:52.640
Thank you.

1407
00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:53.315
Thank you.

1408
00:48:53.315 --> 00:48:54.170
So rough.

1409
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:55.070
But I love rough.

1410
00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.840
Now when I look at
myself in the mirror

1411
00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:01.760
and I say you are a hot
ass bitch. I believe it.

1412
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.610
And I mean bitch in
the endearing nice way

1413
00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:05.600
that girls use it.

1414
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.470
Not when men use it
to degrade each other.

1415
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:07.970
Yes.

1416
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:09.380
You are a fine bitch too.

1417
00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.940
And you are a daddy.

1418
00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:12.440
Daddy.

1419
00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.420
Yeah.

1420
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:14.480
OK.

1421
00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:14.990
All righty.

1422
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:16.160
So until next week.

1423
00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.450
Same time next week?

1424
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:18.990
Yes. please.

1425
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:20.440
All right.

1426
00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:20.940
You got it.

1427
00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:21.320
Come on. girl.

1428
00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:21.980
Can you carry me?

1429
00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.520
I'm tired.

1430
00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:22.700
No.

1431
00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:22.910
No.

1432
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:23.535
Carry me. baby.

1433
00:49:23.535 --> 00:49:24.170
Carry. carry.

1434
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.980
OK.

1435
00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.120
I'm just going to
leave you here then.

1436
00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:26.480
OK.

1437
00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:26.980
Come on.

1438
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:33.709
Bye.

1439
00:49:33.709 --> 00:49:35.206
Oh. I love that.

1440
00:49:35.206 --> 00:49:38.700
Oh. you two.

1441
00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:39.750
I did that.

1442
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:40.980
I did that.

1443
00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.320
Finally.

1444
00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:42.820
Phew.

1445
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:50.630
Look. Mike.

1446
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:52.880
I got to do this for myself.

1447
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.890
Why are you always trying
to make this about you?

1448
00:49:55.890 --> 00:50:00.068
Why do you try so hard
to keep me up under you?

1449
00:50:00.068 --> 00:50:01.860
Look. I used to think
this is all I wanted.

1450
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.820
but I don't want this anymore.

1451
00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.845
It doesn't make me happy at all.

1452
00:50:09.746 --> 00:50:11.180
OK.

1453
00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:15.620
Don't call my phone unless you
call it to talk to little Mike.

1454
00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.621
Bye.

1455
00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:22.050
What the hell is she doing here?

1456
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.930
Hey baby.

1457
00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:30.690
Come on. girl.

1458
00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:32.880
Come mama.

1459
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:36.270
Girl. what is so important that
you had to pop up over here?

1460
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:38.227
Like. I was over there
watching..

1461
00:50:38.227 --> 00:50:39.060
Girl. that can wait.

1462
00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.250
Look. I want to take
you somewhere. OK?

1463
00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:42.840
Somewhere like where?

1464
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.900
Just shut up.

1465
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.700
Go get some lotion on.

1466
00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.590
Oh my gosh. I can't with you.

1467
00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:50.610
Hurry up. hurry up.

1468
00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:09.450
I mean. like. seriously.

1469
00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:11.875
There he is. right there.

1470
00:51:11.875 --> 00:51:12.583
Don't be nervous.

1471
00:51:12.583 --> 00:51:15.900
You got it.

1472
00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:19.110
Yo. Stacy.

1473
00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:20.820
Jasmine. right?

1474
00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.870
Hey Reggie.

1475
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:23.310
How are you?

1476
00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:24.230
Can't complain.

1477
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:27.580
Grandma always told
me. don't nobody care.

1478
00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.370
I care.

1479
00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:30.900
Thank you.

1480
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.900
Y'all know each other?

1481
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.250
What brings you all two in?

1482
00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:37.590
Where little man at?

1483
00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:41.890
All right. I'mma let you all
go ahead and do that part. OK?

1484
00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:44.530
Yo. yo. wait. wait.
wait. hold on.

1485
00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:46.370
What the hell is all this?

1486
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:48.790
Yeah I know my girl
is really feeling you.

1487
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:51.280
I mean. guess I could
be all right with that.

1488
00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:55.660
Y'all got a little spark and
everything. so. you know.

1489
00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:56.870
I just want her to be happy.

1490
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:59.710
And I think you can
make her happy when

1491
00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:01.060
you're not being an asshole.

1492
00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:01.580
What?

1493
00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:02.080
who me?

1494
00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:02.830
An asshole?

1495
00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:03.920
Never.

1496
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.420
Get.

1497
00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:05.620
Yes.

1498
00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.480
Anyway. go on over
there and talk to her.

1499
00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.440
Bring it in. come on.

1500
00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.840
Thank you for what you
did for Paul and Carlene.

1501
00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.870
I know their relationship
is holding on by hope

1502
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:18.460
and a prayer. but you helped.

1503
00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.650
And also thank you for
what you did for me.

1504
00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:22.485
What I do for you?

1505
00:52:22.485 --> 00:52:24.610
When we first met. I thought
I had all the answers.

1506
00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:28.390
But you clearly showed
me a unique perspective.

1507
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:30.410
And just thank you for that.

1508
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:34.390
Also I apologize. because
you a bum ass therapist.

1509
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:36.130
Well. finally.

1510
00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:37.000
Thank you.

1511
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.950
Just doing my job.

1512
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:40.420
Anyway. let me get out of here.

1513
00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:44.200
But she already know
about the pretzel. nigga.

1514
00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:48.910
Oh. for sure.

1515
00:52:51.185 --> 00:52:51.685
So--

1516
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:16.000
Hey.

1517
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:21.490
Well look at you looking
like you need a therapist.

1518
00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:23.650
Oh. how are things. Paul?

1519
00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:24.440
Oh my gosh.

1520
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.510
We're doing so much better.

1521
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:29.460
I mean. I know it's been a short
time. but me and my boo-boo.

1522
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:30.500
we on the right track.

1523
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.850
And that is thanks to you.

1524
00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:35.400
And Reggie for being awful.

1525
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.040
Awful?

1526
00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.730
Come on now. he is not that bad.

1527
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:38.720
It was that bad.

1528
00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.880
He was terrible.

1529
00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.130
I'm talking about
terrible at haircuts

1530
00:53:42.130 --> 00:53:44.110
and he was terrible
giving therapy.

1531
00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:47.230
I ain't going to lie. he did
fuck your hair cut pretty bad.

1532
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:49.300
I'm sorry. but he did. he did.

1533
00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:50.500
Tell me about it.

1534
00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.070
OK.

1535
00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:54.820
How about a double shot of
Tres Anejos for my lady?

1536
00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:55.630
Is that OK?

1537
00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:56.290
Yes. thank you.

1538
00:53:56.290 --> 00:53:56.790
All right.

1539
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.490
Mr Cooper?

1540
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:05.320
Is that you?

1541
00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.070
Yeah.

1542
00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:06.970
Oh. hi.

1543
00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:08.630
Mrs Hampton. right?

1544
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:09.890
From our sessions.

1545
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:10.720
Yes.

1546
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.460
How are you?

1547
00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:15.310
How's uh. I don't
know. what's her name?

1548
00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:15.910
Renee.

1549
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:16.800
Yeah.

1550
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.070
Yeah.

1551
00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:19.750
We didn't make it.

1552
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:22.150
Oh. I'm really
sorry to hear that.

1553
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:24.280
Nothing to be sorry about.

1554
00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:28.470
We weren't exactly
meant for each other.

1555
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:30.000
You seem different than before.

1556
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.670
Like. the glasses. the
accent. your clothes.

1557
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:34.890
What changed?

1558
00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:37.170
This is the real me.

1559
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:42.590
That guy you met a while
back. he was just an act.

1560
00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:43.761
I don't understand.

1561
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.060
People are really fickle.

1562
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:54.770
Especially when it
comes to relationships.

1563
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:58.010
We contrive and
conform to the person

1564
00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:00.650
we think our
significant others want.

1565
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:03.530
In Renee's case.
she was attracted

1566
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:08.120
to nerdy. insecure.
unattractive. beta

1567
00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.370
male Poindexters.

1568
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:12.750
So I became that for her.

1569
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:16.740
I think it gave her some false
sense of power or confidence.

1570
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:22.060
However. I was
still me internally.

1571
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:28.750
So ultimately. my true
colors revealed itself

1572
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:30.760
throughout our marriage.

1573
00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:31.450
I see.

1574
00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:34.820
And so this is the real you?

1575
00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:36.610
It is.

1576
00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:39.250
Honestly. I kind of
like this version of you

1577
00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:42.010
better. Mr Cooper.

1578
00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:44.780
Call me Sean.

1579
00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:47.170
Quick question.

1580
00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:51.277
What brings you in here midday?

1581
00:55:51.277 --> 00:55:52.735
You ever do something
that you know

1582
00:55:52.735 --> 00:55:55.750
is right because you had to?

1583
00:55:55.750 --> 00:56:01.030
I was a little down about it.
but somehow I feel better now.

1584
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:02.650
You want to talk about it?

1585
00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:05.690
Nah. it's not a big deal.

1586
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:07.990
Let me buy you a
couple of drinks.

1587
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:10.840
We'll talk a little bit.

1588
00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:11.800
Sure.

1589
00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:12.640
I like that.

1590
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:41.740
Well. Miss Hampton.
I got to get going.

1591
00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:44.300
Hey. call me Stacey.

1592
00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:45.725
OK then.

1593
00:56:45.725 --> 00:56:46.225
Stacey.

1594
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:51.370
Here. take down my number.

1595
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:54.110
Feel free to call me sometime.

1596
00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:54.942
Yeah. for sure.

1597
00:56:54.942 --> 00:56:56.525
I mean. I really
enjoyed your company.

1598
00:57:06.264 --> 00:57:07.270
Thank you.

1599
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:09.240
See you.

1600
00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:09.855
Bye Sean.

1601
00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.680
And here you go.

1602
00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.880
Got something for you.

1603
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.890
Oh no. Paul. Sean
got the tab already.

1604
00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:21.850
No. no. no. look at it.

1605
00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:22.600
Look at it.

1606
00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:28.900
Paul. what is this.

1607
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:30.667
It's a check.

1608
00:57:30.667 --> 00:57:32.500
I mean. I can see that.
sir. but why are you

1609
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.708
giving me this kind of money?

1610
00:57:33.708 --> 00:57:36.340
Listen. I overheard you and
Reggie having a conversation

1611
00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.840
about your student loan debt.

1612
00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:42.790
And you have helped me
so much with Carlene.

1613
00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:46.390
That's the least I can do
to show my appreciation.

1614
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:48.610
Paul this is a lot of money.

1615
00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:50.390
Like where did you
get this from. man?

1616
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:51.220
I mean--

1617
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.650
I own this place and
at least five others.

1618
00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:55.810
Can I keep it funky
fresh with you?

1619
00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:56.360
Yeah. please.

1620
00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:57.370
Yeah. yeah.

1621
00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:00.400
So. I won the lottery
three years ago.

1622
00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.590
$40 million in the bank.

1623
00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:05.440
And I also played professional
hockey for eight years.

1624
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.845
And nobody even recognized me.

1625
00:58:06.845 --> 00:58:09.220
I mean. I don't even think
black people recognize-- well.

1626
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.170
maybe they did. I'm
not really sure.

1627
00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:12.830
That's beside the point. OK?

1628
00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:13.360
Listen.

1629
00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.980
Stacy. I want you
to take the money.

1630
00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:15.880
I insist.

1631
00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.530
It's just chump change to me.

1632
00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:20.200
I mean. I'm rich.

1633
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.970
Not regular rich.

1634
00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:23.980
I'm rich. rich.

1635
00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:25.990
I just like to keep
a low profile. OK.

1636
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:30.370
So tell people if they ask
you that I'm not the owner.

1637
00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:34.450
Because I'm the bartender.

1638
00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:36.080
Why you coming with me?

1639
00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:38.710
I'm the bartender.

1640
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:41.290
Ooh. why don't you
say it with me?

1641
00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:42.430
Give me a hug. girl.

1642
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:45.500
Oh. thank you so much.

1643
00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.270
Oh my God.

1644
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:47.977
Listen. you deserve it. OK.

1645
00:58:47.977 --> 00:58:49.060
You deserve it. all right.

1646
00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:51.961
Don't spend it all
in one place. now.

1647
00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:15.320
Hey. baby.

1648
00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:15.890
Real quick.

1649
00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:17.598
You think you could
pay fade on the back?

1650
00:59:17.598 --> 00:59:19.010
Give me a number
two on the side.

1651
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:20.900
You sure?

1652
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:21.980
Just grab the clippers.

1653
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.438
Fade me out right
here. right here.

1654
00:59:23.438 --> 00:59:24.130
OK.

1655
00:59:24.130 --> 00:59:25.550
Hey. what's up. Reggie?

1656
00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:26.220
Oh.

1657
00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:27.430
Paul.

1658
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:29.660
Carlene?

1659
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:31.560
Fuck you. Reggie.

1660
00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.800
OK.

1661
00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:34.382
Yeah. baby.

1662
00:59:34.382 --> 00:59:35.090
Come on. it's OK.

1663
00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:37.914
It's a little tight about the--

1664
00:59:37.914 --> 00:59:39.486
Hey.

1665
00:59:39.486 --> 00:59:40.980
My nigga. Sean.

1666
00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:42.000
What up my nigga?

1667
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:42.900
Who is this?

1668
00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:44.300
Oh.

1669
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.080
Don't fuck this
up for me. homes.

1670
00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.670
Got a good thing
going with my lady.

1671
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:50.880
You fuck it up. I'll
slit your fucking throat.

1672
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.370
For sure.

1673
00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:55.860
How do you all know each other?

1674
00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:56.670
OK.

1675
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:59.220
Stacy here. she had
introduced me to my girl.

1676
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.155
and gave them some
great therapy.

1677
01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:07.090
My baby's dope like that.

1678
01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:09.300
Oh. we actually got
something for you.

1679
01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:09.800
Oh. OK.

1680
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.400
What's up?

1681
01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.230
Here you go.

1682
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:14.340
What's this?

1683
01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:16.380
Open it.

1684
01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:16.880
Oh.

1685
01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:20.430
Oh.

1686
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:21.510
What's this for?

1687
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:22.800
It's for your shop.

1688
01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.020
I know you want to pay
it off and everything.

1689
01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.120
and we just want
to help you out.

1690
01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:30.120
Paul man. you really
didn't have to do that.

1691
01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.600
But I'm glad you did.

1692
01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.430
I'm glad you did.

1693
01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:35.490
It's the least I can
do for you helping--

1694
01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:36.270
you too. Stacey.

1695
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:38.010
Helping me and Carlene
get back together.

1696
01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:39.750
get that groove. that mojo.

1697
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:41.610
That's what friends are for.

1698
01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:45.900
Even though I told him
not to give you shit.

1699
01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.670
It's just crazy.

1700
01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:52.140
All these people crazy.

1701
01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:55.080
You got this lady dressed
like a Megan Thee Stallion.

1702
01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.760
Her guy just looking goofy.

1703
01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.340
My mamma friend Stacy
is fine. though.

1704
01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.740
She needs to give me a chance.

1705
01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.600
This dude she with
now look like he's

1706
01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.980
going to do her wrong
in about 11 more days.

1707
01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:09.640
My mamma's so confused.

1708
01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.300
She just wants to be an
independent woman that

1709
01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.100
doesn't even work.

1710
01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.200
Reggie. he pretty cool.

1711
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.720
He treats my mom better
than my dad does.

1712
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.640
So I'm good with that.

1713
01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.220
Just to keep him on
his toes. I am not

1714
01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:25.500
going to let him
know that I like him.

1715
01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.705
All in all. these
fools all crazy.

1716
01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:35.800
You know what. honestly. I think
we could all use a little thot

1717
01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.440
therapy sometimes.

1718
01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.250
I say that right?

1719
01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:39.750
Yeah?

1720
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:40.277
Yeah.

1721
01:01:40.277 --> 01:01:41.770
Did I?

1722
01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:44.830
What do you think little guy?

1723
01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:46.300
Come be my therapist. baby.

1724
01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.160
You who I'm sharing with. baby.

1725
01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.600
Let me lay in your presence.

1726
01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.160
Yes. it's so effortless. baby.

1727
01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.870
Because you're so
easy to talk to.

1728
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:54.460
I often wish we was closer.

1729
01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.080
Hope for the
sessions to bless us.

1730
01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.790
Yes. I might need to stay over.

1731
01:01:57.790 --> 01:01:59.290
Hold in trauma from drama.

1732
01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:00.910
Now I can't tell
if they love me.

1733
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:02.650
but when we look
for the problem.

1734
01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:04.180
I always find out it was me.

1735
01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.680
Hug me baby. I miss you.

1736
01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.390
Don't take negative with you.

1737
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:10.600
Only positive vibes. baby.
I'll never forget you.

1738
01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.130
I do therapy with you.

1739
01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.688
Yeah.

1740
01:02:15.688 --> 01:02:17.170
Come on. baby.

1741
01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:20.350
I do therapy with you.

1742
01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:22.060
Come with me.

1743
01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.590
Yeah.

1744
01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:25.520
I do therapy with you. baby.

1745
01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.800
Come lay in my presence.

1746
01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.280
I teach you how to love.

1747
01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.070
And it ain't just
paying for presents.

1748
01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:33.260
It's about paying attention.
listening all of your essence.

1749
01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:36.400
this is an audio lesson.
listen to all of your sessions.

1750
01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.755
Just let the therapy bless
us. so we all can be better.
