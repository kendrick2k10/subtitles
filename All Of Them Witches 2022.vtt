This book is written by

The "Malleus Maleficarum"

...and therefore against women.

and you're wicked.
so you're a witch.

218
00:12:19.564 --> 00:12:21.479
So you would be killed
as a witch then.

219
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.872
You're killed if you're ugly.

220
00:12:23.003 --> 00:12:24.700
You're killed

When you say the word witchcraft
in the United States.

233
00:12:58.603 --> 00:13:04.827
most people immediately think of
the Salem witch trials in 1692.

234
00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.221
Period of about nine months.

235
00:13:07.351 --> 00:13:11.616
there was widespread
moral panic.

236
00:13:11.747 --> 00:13:15.707
Basically. anybody could be
accused of witchcraft --

237
00:13:15.838 --> 00:13:20.974
children accusing their mothers
or their fathers and vice versa.

238
00:13:21.104 --> 00:13:23.280
Grossman: I think
one of the reasons that Salem

239
00:13:23.411 --> 00:13:26.762
has captured
a lot of our imaginations

240
00:13:26.893 --> 00:13:34.248
is that the center
of that story is young girls.

241
00:13:34.378 --> 00:13:36.163
Narrator: Since 1953.

242
00:13:36.293 --> 00:13:38.339
Arthur Miller's
Tony Award-winning play

243
00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:39.514
"The Crucible"...

244
00:13:39.644 --> 00:13:41.342
But they're speaking
of witchcraft.

245
00:13:41.472 --> 00:13:43.953
...has been performed
on stages and screens

246
00:13:44.084 --> 00:13:48.001
by scores of young women.You drank a charm to kill
John Proctor's wife!

247
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:51.308
Miller's play would use
the real Salem witch trials

248
00:13:51.439 --> 00:13:56.357
as the basis of his allegory
about McCarthyism.

249
00:13:56.487 --> 00:13:59.751
but he casts
his Abigail Williams

250
00:13:59.882 --> 00:14:03.190
as a devious home wrecker

251
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.151
when in real life.
Abigail was only 11.

252
00:14:08.282 --> 00:14:11.459
Grossman:
"The Crucible" re-popularized

253
00:14:11.589 --> 00:14:12.939
the Salem witch trials.

254
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:15.811
but in real life.
what happened in Salem

255
00:14:15.942 --> 00:14:18.683
is a less sensationalist story

256
00:14:18.814 --> 00:14:21.121
than the one that Arthur Miller
told in "The Crucible."

257
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:23.645
which is super sexualized.

258
00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:26.213

259
00:14:26.343 --> 00:14:29.042
Ward: There were 19 people
that were hung.

260
00:14:29.172 --> 00:14:33.524
14 of those were women
and 5 of them were men.

261
00:14:33.655 --> 00:14:36.701

executed for witchcraft.

263
00:14:38.268 --> 00:14:40.357
But. in fact.
no one was actually

264
00:14:40.488 --> 00:14:42.707
burned to death in Salem.

265
00:14:42.838 --> 00:14:44.405
People were hung.

266
00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:48.583
People were pressed to death
with heavy stones.

267
00:14:48.713 --> 00:14:53.066
And the loss of life
was horrific.

268
00:14:53.196 --> 00:14:56.808
but we're talking
a couple dozen people.

269
00:14:56.939 --> 00:14:59.420
as opposed to
the tens of thousands of people

270
00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.771
that were killed. you know.
throughout Western Europe.

271
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:10.170
The witch hunts are sometimes
called the Burning Times

272
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:15.088
because many. many people were
burned in the public square

273
00:15:15.218 --> 00:15:19.179
and would often burn to death
or asphyxiate.

274
00:15:19.309 --> 00:15:24.619
Particularly in England.
there are also some tests

275
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:29.232
if one is accused
of being a witch.

276
00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:32.192
You might prick them with a pin

277
00:15:32.322 --> 00:15:36.805
and see if the wound bleeds.

278
00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:40.678
You might put them in water

279
00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:44.552
with chains or weights
on their body

280
00:15:44.682 --> 00:15:47.772
and see if they drown.

281
00:15:47.903 --> 00:15:49.296
If the person drowns.

282
00:15:49.426 --> 00:15:52.864
"Oh. I guess they weren't
a witch after all."

283
00:15:52.995 --> 00:15:56.172
so it's a real
lose-lose situation.

284
00:15:56.303 --> 00:15:59.262
Now. were these women
actually witches?

285
00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:01.264
Most of the research suggests

286
00:16:01.395 --> 00:16:04.789
that the women who were killed
were innocents.

287
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:12.362
And it was a crime that was
almost impossible to disprove.

288
00:16:12.493 --> 00:16:16.671
Many of the accusations
had to do with dreams.

289
00:16:16.801 --> 00:16:20.240
There was spectral evidence.

290
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.112
For example. King James --

291
00:16:23.243 --> 00:16:26.898
the first of England.
the sixth of Scotland --

292
00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:29.727
he and his new bride
from Denmark

293
00:16:29.858 --> 00:16:32.513
were hit by a terrible storm.

294
00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:38.998
They were crossing from Denmark
back to Scotland

295
00:16:39.128 --> 00:16:42.958
and almost died in a shipwreck.

296
00:16:43.089 --> 00:16:49.617
He had a dream in which
he thought he had been cursed.

297
00:16:49.747 --> 00:16:53.142

304

305

Dorsey: I think that
the zombie myth really sort of

356
00:20:00.851 --> 00:20:03.593
grew out of the fact
that there were puffer fish

357
00:20:03.724 --> 00:20:05.682
that were native
to the Haitian waters

358
00:20:05.813 --> 00:20:08.555

temporary paralysis.

where they came from.

527
00:28:27.096 --> 00:28:29.882
I picture the women

of their grandmothers

535
00:28:47.813 --> 00:28:49.684
and their grandfathers
and say to them.

536
00:28:49.815 --> 00:28:51.164
"Do you remember this plant?

537
00:28:51.294 --> 00:28:53.644
Do you remember how your grandma
used to use this plant?"

538
00:28:53.775 --> 00:28:56.604

would light up.

And I'm like. "My grandmother
did the same thing."

543
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.270
I come from lots of different
facets of spirituality.

of folk magic.

what we now refer to today

as being a coven --

581
00:31:43.336 --> 00:31:45.381
12 people who would meet

and then one person
overseeing the coven

583
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:52.780
as a priest or a priestess.

584
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:57.654
Margaret Murray takes
this confession of Isobel Gowdie

585

a pretty controversial figure.

the most prominent one being
a man named Gerald Gardner.

592
00:32:26.118 --> 00:32:28.729
He took a lot of
Margaret Murray's ideas.

593
00:32:28.859 --> 00:32:30.949

particularly
in Celtic countries.

604
00:33:07.681 --> 00:33:12.512
Samhain was a traditional
holiday prior to Christianity.

returning from the beyond.

664

Forget that the high priestess

665

This was political theater.

but they started to get out
the word "witch."

676
00:37:28.898 --> 00:37:31.771
Why did they take witch?
It's sort of in your face.

And for many of these women.

678

and moved by these groups
that she ends up

692
00:38:20.254 --> 00:38:24.127
becoming a Wiccan
high priestess herself.

693
00:38:24.258 --> 00:38:27.653

our spirituality is political.

694

the rituals that we develop.

695

we can elevate the feminine

698
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:52.939
into systems that serve us
and honor marginalized people

699
00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:57.465

or pushed aside

700
00:38:57.596 --> 00:39:01.469
in a lot of the world's
largest religions.

701
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:11.044
♪

702
00:39:11.174 --> 00:39:15.178
Grossman: So if you look
at images of witches.

703
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:18.660
they're often shown
riding broomsticks.

704
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:23.056
They're also sometimes shown
riding cooking forks

705
00:39:23.186 --> 00:39:27.408
or any simple domestic object
they can fly.

706
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:35.851
In the '70s.
a writer named Michael Harner

707
00:39:35.982 --> 00:39:39.289
put forth this theory
that perhaps the reason

708
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:43.119
that we associate witches
and broomsticks

709
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:48.037
is that these women were taking
these hallucinogenic herbs.

710
00:39:48.168 --> 00:39:51.301
rubbing them on the heads
of broomsticks

711
00:39:51.432 --> 00:39:55.828
and then inserting them
into their orifice

712
00:39:55.958 --> 00:40:00.528
in order to get that
contact high all the quicker.

713
00:40:00.659 --> 00:40:02.835
As you can imagine.
a lot of people love this idea

714
00:40:02.965 --> 00:40:05.664
and have really gotten
carried away with the idea

715
00:40:05.794 --> 00:40:07.317
that witches were just.
you know. ladies

716
00:40:07.448 --> 00:40:10.886
who were masturbating
with hallucinogenic dildos.

717
00:40:14.412 --> 00:40:19.373
Narrator: We are done being
defined and defamed.

718
00:40:19.504 --> 00:40:25.074
We are the only ones
who can call ourselves witch.

719
00:40:27.337 --> 00:40:31.820
A witch is someone who stands
on her own and who's powerful

720
00:40:31.951 --> 00:40:37.478
and who the status quo
is afraid of.

721
00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:43.266
Witchcraft is growing in appeal.
especially now. I believe.

722
00:40:43.397 --> 00:40:47.706
because that it is
all about empowerment.

723
00:40:47.836 --> 00:40:51.057
I absolutely adore Rachel True
in "The Craft."

724
00:40:51.187 --> 00:40:54.452
So many of us didn't get to see
a Black witch

725
00:40:54.582 --> 00:40:56.323
until we saw her face.

726
00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:59.935
In 1986. most witches were in

727
00:41:00.066 --> 00:41:02.547
what they call the broom closet.

728
00:41:02.677 --> 00:41:05.898
What we saw in the 1990s --

729
00:41:06.028 --> 00:41:09.336
"Charmed."
the "Harry Potter" series --

730
00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:13.122
and directly after that there
was an increase of searches

731
00:41:13.253 --> 00:41:15.385
about witchcraft online.

732
00:41:15.516 --> 00:41:20.347
Along comes the Internet.
and you have people

733
00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:25.352
who are emboldened to start
sharing who they actually are.

734
00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:28.181
and it's really helped
to destigmatize

735
00:41:28.311 --> 00:41:29.965
the practice of witchcraft

736
00:41:30.096 --> 00:41:33.621
and to show us
that there are others like us.

737
00:41:33.752 --> 00:41:35.536
and that there's
a whole community out there

738
00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:38.408
that we can connect to
and plug into.

739
00:41:38.539 --> 00:41:41.803
And absolutely.
witches can be any gender.

740
00:41:41.934 --> 00:41:44.066
Is there a difference between
the masculine and the feminine?

741
00:41:44.197 --> 00:41:45.807
Absolutely.

742
00:41:45.938 --> 00:41:46.895
Is there a mixture
of the non-binary magic

743
00:41:47.026 --> 00:41:48.375
or non-conforming magic?

744
00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:50.203
Absolutely. for sure.

They're serious
about their practice.

749
00:42:03.956 --> 00:42:06.219

to discount the young.
