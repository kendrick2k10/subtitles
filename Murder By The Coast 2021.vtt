3
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.360
Everyone ready?

4
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.360
Because I'll only say this once.

5
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.480
For a year and 11 months.

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.320
a family has been grieving
the loss of this individual.

7
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.920
And on Saturday.
you called it a soap opera.

8
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.680
On Sunday.
you compared it to an Almodóvar movie.

9
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.400
This is no soap opera.

10
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.640
It's a trial for a 19-year-old girl.

11
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.000
A search is underway
in Mijas. Málaga. for a 19-year-old woman.

12
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.080
Rocío Wanninkhof.

13
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.040
Everyone was covering it.
The press. television. and the radio.

14
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.960
It was one of the most high-profile cases
in recent years and of its time.

15
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.440
Criminology seeks to answer the question.

16
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.400
"Why do certain people cross that line
and end up killing someone?"

17
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.680
I'm a lawyer and criminologist.
I'd say this case is an example

18
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.560
for any law student.

19
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.800
Well. there were a lot of us at first.
and Rocío was there from the start.

20
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.840
It's not like she was that into soccer.

21
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.120
but she did enjoy
the fun times we had. and--

22
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.560
She tried it and liked it.

23
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.680
She was number six. the number she liked.

24
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.080
-Yeah. six.
-We each had our own number.

25
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.600
Our own assigned number.
We'd argue if anyone changed it.

26
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.560
-Our family and friends sat here.
-Yeah.

27
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.480
Everyone came.
Her mother. Rocío. Rosa. Alicia--

28
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.040
-Everyone came.
-All the moms sat here.

29
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.240
When we scored our first goal.
Rocío and I would do this.

30
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.160
This little cheer. "No. copyright."

31
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.720
Yeah. and then we'd copy her right away.
and she'd go. "No. copyright."

32
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.400
-Yeah.
-We were just kid--

33
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.040
-We were only 15 or 16 years old.
-Sixteen.

34
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.080
We were kids.

35
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.720
She was so in love
with her boyfriend at the time. Toni.

36
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.040
-So in love.
-Yeah. she was crazy about him. Crazy.

37
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.120
-They were the best-looking couple.
-He was gorgeous. and so was she.

38
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.920
A beautiful couple. Two attractive people.

39
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.760
-She was a lot of fun to be around.
-A lot of fun.

40
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.840
-She was always smiling--
-Always.

41
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.400
-I never saw her get mad at anyone.
-Never.

42
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.960
She never got mad.

43
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.200
-She was a fun-loving girl.
-Yeah.

44
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.800
Always.
She was always in the mood for fun.

45
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.360
Yeah.

46
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.400
I remember back then.
maybe two or three years in a row.

47
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.040
they had a heavy metal tent at the fair.

48
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.080
From the entrance.

49
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.720
there was the area with rides for kids.

50
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.240
and then the area with tents.
where people would go to eat and dance.

51
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.520
The back. right next to the river.
was for young people.

52
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.280
They set up four shacks.

53
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.480
where we'd drink kalimotxo.
which is what we did then.

54
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.800
Lots of kalimotxo. heavy metal. and rock.
But it was great. All good vibes. always.

55
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.360
That night. we'd planned to meet there.

56
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.160
And I remember
it was around ten o'clock at night.

57
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.360
A few of us
from our friend group were there. waiting.

58
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.440
Hours went by.
and Rocío still hadn't arrived.

59
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.040
We were waiting for her there.
and she didn't show up.

60
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.800
She left her boyfriend's house.

61
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.760
It was a long walk up that hill.

62
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.200
It wasn't lit.
and it was surrounded by fields.

63
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.320
So yeah. she never made it there.

64
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.960
My daughter didn't come home that night.
so we went looking for her.

65
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.080
We were walking along.
and I saw a pretty large bloodstain.

66
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.600
And I said.
"Look at that big bloodstain over there."

67
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.720
"Looks like an animal was killed."

68
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.000
I got a bit closer.

69
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.320
and I saw my daughter's sneakers.

70
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.400
"Those are Rocío's sneakers."

71
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.360
And he said. "They can't be."

72
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.960
I said.
"Those are my daughter's sneakers."

73
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.720
Well. I got hysterical. out of my mind.

74
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.920
I told him.
"Call the police. Those are her sneakers."

75
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.120
LONG HAIR. BROWN EYES

76
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.400
MISSING PERSON REPORT

77
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.040
When she was reported missing.

78
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:36.120
the examining magistrate called.
telling us about a possible crime scene

79
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.040
and asking for our forensic input.

80
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:47.680
Our first assessment was
an incident had taken place there.

81
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.560
involving a lot of blood.

82
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.000
We thought that some kind of assault

83
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.880
involving nose
or mouth injuries had occurred.

84
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.400
Perhaps even a stabbing.

85
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.520
As we moved forward. we kept finding
larger. more drawn-out trails of blood.

86
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.160
They indicated the person
had been moving much more quickly.

87
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.440
Running. maybe.

88
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.680
The trails tapered off for a bit.

89
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.440
until we came to an area
with a much larger bloodstain.

90
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.680
indicating there had been
significant blood loss.

91
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.000
More bloodstains were found

92
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.320
that were consistent with
what we thought was a body being dragged.

93
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.920
They stopped in an area where.
as I recall. there were tire tracks.

94
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.560
We attempted to identify
both the tires and the type of vehicle.

95
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.280
We came across a bloodstained tissue.

96
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.400
and we found a pair of sneakers.
which were identified as the victim's.

97
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.480
PHOTOGRAPHIC REPORT

98
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.720
-SAMPLES FOR ANALYSIS
-BLOOD SAMPLES

99
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.160
-SNEAKERS
-ON THE TISSUE

100
00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.320
CIGARETTE BUTT

101
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.360
The cigarette butts were sent out

102
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.720
to see if DNA could be obtained
from the saliva on them.

103
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:13.120
We collected everything
we thought might provide information

104
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.560
about whether someone had been there
who we could. at some point. identify

105
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.200
using those samples.

106
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.160
DNA OF A MALE FOUND ON THE CIGARETTE BUTT

107
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.880
We then began
a more in-depth investigation

108
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.720
based on that data.

109
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.000
I don't remember who called me
or how I found out Rocío had been missing

110
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.360
since the night we'd planned to meet.

111
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.840
I remember turning on the news
in the morning and hearing on the radio

112
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.040
that Rocío had disappeared.

113
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.560
And it was a shock. I started crying.
My boss asked. "What's wrong?"

114
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.240
I said. "That's my friend."
"What happened?"

115
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.280
That's when I learned that.
in La Cala. the local police

116
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.440
and medical personnel
were already conducting a search.

117
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.760
So. I asked my boss
if I could join the search party.

118
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.040
along with the rest of my friends.

119
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.600
I'm asking everyone
to please bring my daughter back.

120
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.320
And to treat her as well as possible.
Many people--

121
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.280
Thank you
to the people who are helping us.

122
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.320
There are so many of them.

123
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.000
I have three daughters around her age.

124
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.720
We live nearby.
We came to offer our support.

125
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.280
To support her mother.
her father. and her whole family.

126
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.200
We're going to try to keep this going.
and we won't stop until Rocío's found.

127
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.840
The search continues.

128
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.640
The 19-year-old
who went missing on Saturday…

129
00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.760
A week after the search.
involving over 600 people. began…

130
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.080
Groups went
with the Civil Defence and local police.

131
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.800
and we went out on our own.
on our dirt bikes. up into the hills.

132
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:34.080
Just searching.
Like looking for a needle in a haystack.

133
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.480
And we were on edge. thinking.

134
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.720
"What if something really happened
and I find her?"

135
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.360
"Or I lift up
a manhole cover and find her?"

136
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.680
"What if I happen to look
behind that tree? What if…"

137
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.040
It was really tough.

138
00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.360
I remember we went with a coworker.

139
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.560
We parked our van
outside Alicia Hornos's house.

140
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.080
People were constantly coming and going.

141
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.480
The family kept coming out to talk
to the media. who were asking for them.

142
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.440
If no one speaks up.
if no one says anything.

143
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.440
then people forget.

144
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.000
And as you can see. the media's all here.

145
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.280
the press is here.
all the TV stations are here.

146
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.240
It's the only way to keep this alive.

147
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.200
I want them to give her back.

148
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.680
Dead or alive. I just want her back.

149
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.880
Three weeks had gone by.

150
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:45.560
and. of course. there were lots of tears
and anxiety over her disappearance.

151
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.800
a lot of crying.

152
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.520
And that feeling spread.

153
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.920
It wasn't just the family.
who was the most affected. who felt it.

154
00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.960
The volunteers. her friends from school.
and her neighborhood friends felt it too.

155
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.760
That was basically the whole mood.

156
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.280
A mood of pervasive sadness.

157
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.880
We're about to bring you news
that we hoped never to have to share.

158
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.440
A body has been found
that may be that of Rocío Wanninkhof.

159
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.960
25 days after she went missing.

160
00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.800
The body was found hidden in some hedges
separating a housing development.

161
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:54.000
just 200 meters away
from the highway to Marbella.

162
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.520
along a path
where hardly any vehicle could fit.

163
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.120
When authorities arrived
on the scene to remove the body.

164
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.280
they found little was left but a skeleton.

165
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.840
It looked like a body
that had been there for much longer.

166
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.280
While collecting samples.

167
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.600
they found some bags.
big black garbage bags.

168
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.920
with clothes in them.

169
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.120
mostly T-shirts.

170
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.840
Based on those T-shirts.
we began to feel reasonably confident

171
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.280
that the body might be that
of the girl. Rocío Wanninkhof.

172
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.720
You know what? I pass by there every day.

173
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.600
And I remember. every day.
I turn my head and look. out of habit.

174
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.520
On the way there and back.

175
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.160
And I think. "We were looking here.
and she was found 20 kilometers away."

176
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.960
When we planned the autopsy.
the five medical examiners present--

177
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.120
I mean. six of us--

178
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.160
we actually did it almost in secret

179
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.600
because we knew it was a media circus.

180
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.680
So we conducted the autopsy
and took our time with it.

181
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.080
We worked into the night.
trying to use all our know-how

182
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.320
because we knew
it would be all over the media.

183
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.400
The body we had to work with
was going to provide us with

184
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.920
much less information than it would have
had it decomposed at a normal rate.

185
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.440
But under certain conditions
of humidity. rain. and heat.

186
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.440
decomposition occurs much more quickly.

187
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.440
There were no organs left.
In other words. all we found were bones.

188
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.320
So we had to find something else

189
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:58.880
that might tell us how the alleged attack
could have occurred.

190
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.480
Multiple. closely-spaced wounds
were present.

191
00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.840
primarily on the back of the corpse.

192
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.400
I believe there were eight
very repetitive stab wounds.

193
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.840
delivered by some kind
of single-edged bladed weapon.

194
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.080
Conclusions?

195
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.400
Well. this attack
was really very vicious and repetitive.

196
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.240
The assailant
apparently carried it out very quickly

197
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.120
because the victim
was either totally restrained

198
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.600
or didn't have enough time to move.

199
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:51.880
I have no doubt that. right now.
you must be feeling heartbroken.

200
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.240
My heart and thoughts go out to them.

201
00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.840
but especially to you.
her parents and siblings.

202
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.280
-Stop that. please.
-Come on.

203
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.840
-Viva Rocío!
-Viva!

204
00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.920
Out of the way. Show some respect. please.
Out of the way. Come on.

205
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.760
-Come on. now.
-Viva!

206
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.960
Make room.

207
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.120
-Just a little.
-Let them through.

208
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.680
-We'll lower her and put her in.
-Okay.

209
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.720
-Come on.
-Let's move forward.

210
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.080
-Let's move forward a bit. Come on.
-Goodbye. beautiful. Goodbye.

211
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:36.920
Come on. A little more.
A little further. Push. Come on.

212
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.920
-Give them a moment alone.
-Come on. It's her mother. Just a moment.

213
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.200
At that point. obviously.

214
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.520
everyone close to Rocío. and even everyone
in her town. was living in fear.

215
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.120
This fear was fueled. in part.
by the panic stirred up by the press.

216
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.040
especially the television programs
talking about the case.

217
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.560
Ultimately. that led to the involvement
of the elite Civil Guard squad

218
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.520
that had played an active role
in the Alcàsser investigation.

219
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.960
So they were greeted with open arms.

220
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.720
The investigators found some fingerprints

221
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.880
on the plastic bags
at the last crime scene.

222
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.960
They analyzed the tire tracks
found in the vacant lot.

223
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.560
And they found two textile fibers
on Rocío Wanninkhof's body.

224
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.040
At that point. the investigations
were still not leading up

225
00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.640
to anyone's arrest.

226
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.520
But there were already certain pieces
of information. evidence. and speculations

227
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.240
that the Civil Guard were exploring.

228
00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.240
As this remains an open case.
we're all asking.

229
00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.120
"Who is the culprit?
When will they be caught?"

230
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.920
The investigators
needed to find something.

231
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.920
They were under enormous pressure
from the public.

232
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.240
And they had nothing.

233
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.040
The fact that Rocío's body
was found in such poor condition

234
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.760
made it impossible
to confirm basic details.

235
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:25.200
Like. for example.
whether Rocío had been sexually assaulted.

236
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.800
VISUAL INSPECTION REPORT

237
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.960
THE NAKED CORPSE

238
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.160
What happened?

239
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:36.200
Well. one of the theories
and conclusions the investigators came to

240
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.160
upon seeing
that the body's legs were spread--

241
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.960
since they were spread so wide apart.
they believed it had been staged.

242
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:50.200
In other words. the perpetrator
had tampered with the crime scene

243
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.040
to make it look like a sexual assault.

244
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.320
So they ruled out sexual assault

245
00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.520
and focused on
the motive of hatred and revenge.

246
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.280
-Could this be a crime of passion?
-Someone very close to the family.

247
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.200
Very passionate and very resentful.

248
00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.600
-Very close to them.
-Margarita Landi's opinion.

249
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.480
Which I partly agree with.

250
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.640
So they began questioning
the people closest to Rocío Wanninkhof.

251
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.800
WE ARE HEREBY TAKING A STATEMENT FROM

252
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.880
Even her boyfriend was questioned.

253
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.480
as was Rocío's family.

254
00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.280
And everyone had an alibi.

255
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.760
Can we ask you just one question?

256
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.720
It's been almost a year
since Rocío's death.

257
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:47.920
For now. the Civil Guard has narrowed down
the number of prime suspects to three.

258
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.920
Two men and a woman.

259
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.960
Near the end of the year.
they identified a suspect

260
00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.240
that signs supposedly pointed to.

261
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.040
SIGNS

262
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:04.720
In the end. what aroused suspicion
was someone reported having seen a woman

263
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.840
stabbing Rocío's photo.

264
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.000
It seems police are getting closer
to finding Rocío Wanninkhof's killer.

265
00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.720
Not only did news come out
about there being a suspect.

266
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.880
but the suspect's full name was released.

267
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.040
Dolores Vázquez.

268
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.200
There she is. Loli Vázquez.

269
00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.400
TELEDIARIO

270
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.840
In the early hours of October 9 last year.
Rocío Wanninkhof was killed.

271
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.920
stabbed ten times in the back.

272
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.160
Her body was found after a long search.

273
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:13.640
Today. a friend of the woman's mother
spent five hours before the judge.

274
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.200
accused of that murder.

275
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.280
Come on. Everyone out of the way!

276
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.840
The police called to say

277
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.520
that they had arrested
María Dolores Vázquez. Loli.

278
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.040
I was stunned.
She's the last person I'd have suspected.

279
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.040
She was good to me during the separation.
She helped with the kids.

280
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.840
Getting them from school.
giving them rides. baths. making dinner.

281
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.360
She helped out a lot.

282
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.600
Where are you taking her?

283
00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.960
Murderer!

284
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.320
Murderer!

285
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:54.240
Murderer!

286
00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.080
Murderer!

287
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.680
María Dolores Vázquez.
a close friend of the girl's mother.

288
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.080
Dolores is Alicia's close friend.

289
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.560
Their close friend.

290
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.840
Dolores Vázquez. a family friend.

291
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.240
Accused of killing the daughter
of Alicia Hornos. her former close friend.

292
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.680
She was Rocío's mother's best friend.

293
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.760
She watched her grow up.
She helped raise her like a second mother.

294
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.680
They bought this house in Mijas
and started a new life together.

295
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.040
with Alicia's three children.

296
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:37.720
The victim's mother.
Alicia. had three children.

297
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.960
She'd separated from her husband.
who lived in the Netherlands.

298
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.960
and gotten involved with someone.

299
00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.840
She began a relationship
with Dolores Vázquez.

300
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.680
They were romantically involved
for almost 11 years.

301
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.600
She'd helped raise Alicia's daughters.

302
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.520
But. at the time of the crime.

303
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.200
their relationship
had already been over for four years.

304
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.760
I loved her
more than I've ever loved anyone.

305
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.960
Truly.

306
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.960
She gave me affection and support.

307
00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.360
She comforted me.

308
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.440
And I loved her so much.

309
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.960
My daughter lived with them for many years
when she was studying in Málaga.

310
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.720
And she was with her aunt Loli.
Alicia. and Rocío then.

311
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.120
They're all lovely girls.

312
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.840
Alicia. too.
So. to us. it was all perfectly normal.

313
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.720
JUDGE SENDS WANNINKHOF'S
ALLEGED KILLER TO JAIL

314
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.680
The investigation
began to center on Vázquez.

315
00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.480
And there was the motive.
one of the motives that any jury

316
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.200
or court could begin to consider.

317
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:58.640
which is that the girl
was an obstacle. or was against.

318
00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.160
or was somehow. a problem

319
00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.040
for Dolores's relationship
with the girl's mother.

320
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.520
So we had the motive.

321
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.040
Loli said if it weren't for Rocío.
I'd have gotten back with her.

322
00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.000
That's why my daughter was killed.

323
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.880
If she hadn't been so jealous

324
00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:24.680
and felt I was with someone else.
maybe my daughter would still be alive.

325
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.720
So she did it out of revenge
because I didn't want to go back to her.

326
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:45.960
Dolores Vázquez. in the eyes
of the media and the public. was guilty

327
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.640
from the moment she was arrested.

328
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.920
What do you think?
What does your heart tell you?

329
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.560
I have to say that she seems guilty to me.

330
00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.720
ARRESTED

331
00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.600
Though she hasn't confessed.
La Cala residents are convinced.

332
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.160
There were rumors.
Things were already being said about her.

333
00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.760
From the beginning. the family and police
believed the attacker knew Rocío.

334
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.200
Misleading clues.
allegedly planted by Dolores.

335
00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.040
hindered the investigation.

336
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.000
This crime. this event.

337
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.280
provided material for TV shows.

338
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.000
One of the first in the sense that.
altogether. the elements

339
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:29.640
really represented
a lot of underlying social issues.

340
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.720
Primarily homophobia toward lesbians.

341
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:37.320
The family says Dolores is a hard woman
who is aggressive and very possessive.

342
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.640
She's highly vindictive.
and she's very tough.

343
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.560
How can Alicia Hornos
say such outrageous things

344
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.080
and spread
so many slanderous lies about my sister.

345
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.720
knowing that my sister
helped her raise those three kids?

346
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.480
Spiteful. aggressive. calculating.

347
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.840
Very cold and calculating. Totally.

348
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.320
A character was taking shape.

349
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.760
An evil woman. a cold woman.

350
00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.280
A woman who had laid in wait four years

351
00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:10.280
and devised a plan to kill
Rocío Wanninkhof because she hated her.

352
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:41.920
ALICIA HORNOS CLAIMS DOLORES
KILLED HER DAUGHTER AS REVENGE

353
00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.080
I can still remember the lines at the door

354
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.840
because the whole thing
had become something like a soap opera.

355
00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:01.160
People wanted to follow the trial.
and they didn't miss a minute of it.

356
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.240
They'd wait for four. five hours

357
00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.320
to get into the courtroom
and see what would happen.

358
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.680
I think
that's the most unsettling memory I have.

359
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:17.520
I'll be following the trial. I'm retired.
I've got nothing better to do.

360
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.360
Well. I'm siding
with the dead girl's mother.

361
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.280
She lost her daughter.

362
00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.160
She must be suffering.
I know. I'm a mother too.

363
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.680
And that's huge.

364
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.080
And that other woman.

365
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.760
she seems
very cold. very controlling to me.

366
00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.960
The odds were stacked against Dolores

367
00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.840
because she was Dolores.
someone who wasn't likable.

368
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.120
She wasn't nice or friendly.

369
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.680
She was a lesbian in 1999

370
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.960
and could be sentenced
to 15 years in prison.

371
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:26.840
During this trial. we really had
to fight a battle on the streets.

372
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.720
as well as in the courtroom.

373
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.120
And that information combined

374
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:38.720
with all that media hype really
has an impact when it's a trial by jury.

375
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.400
Members of the press. please wrap it up.

376
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.360
Witness questioning is ongoing.
It will take a long time.

377
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.800
Over 50 people
have been summoned to testify.

378
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:55.280
This morning. a video
from Informe Semanal was shown in court.

379
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.480
It shows a member of the Civil Guard

380
00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:01.120
stating there was no direct evidence
against Dolores Vázquez.

381
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.400
We'll let the investigation carry on.
taking whatever steps necessary

382
00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.160
to find conclusive evidence
that will clarify what happened.

383
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.280
Because. for now. the truth
is that we don't know anything for sure.

384
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.840
not even how or--

385
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.320
We have our theories.
but we don't know what actually happened.

386
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:26.080
Given the lack of physical evidence.
the Civil Guard issued a report

387
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.800
that contained signs

388
00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:32.560
pointing to Dolores Vázquez.
as well as a psychological profile.

389
00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.080
The main piece of evidence

390
00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.880
was the hatred
Dolores Vázquez felt toward Rocío.

391
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.360
You have testified

392
00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.600
that you often clashed
because you were so alike.

393
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:54.320
You were both very stubborn.
and you both liked to have it your way.

394
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.120
Yes. sir.
but that doesn't mean we clashed

395
00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.280
in the sense
that Rocío and I didn't love each other.

396
00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.720
or that we argued.

397
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.360
I had a good relationship with Rocío.
more so than her mother

398
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.240
and the family think.

399
00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.520
A domestic worker.
a Russian woman. if memory serves.

400
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.480
gave an account
of a very significant event.

401
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.200
much like something out of a movie.
which is that--

402
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:28.320
As everyone will remember.
photos of her were posted all over town.

403
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:33.880
She took a kitchen knife
and started stabbing one of those photos.

404
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.960
While she did that with the knife.
she said. "This is my problem!"

405
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.960
She explained. "I was at home.
crying at the sight of Rocío's picture."

406
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.680
"Because my housekeeper
barely understands any Spanish.

407
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.640
I picked up a knife
to show that Rocío had been murdered."

408
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.640
ORAL HEARING PROCEEDINGS

409
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.640
What did Dolores have going for her?

410
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.960
She wasn't seen at the crime scene.

411
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:06.960
the tire tracks didn't match
any of the cars she owned.

412
00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.640
and the textile fibers found
didn't match Dolores's clothing.

413
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.640
It was shown that the fingerprints
found on the garbage bags

414
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.880
did not match those of Dolores Vázquez.

415
00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.520
And she had an alibi.

416
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:30.280
She said she'd been watching
a great-niece of hers that day.

417
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.400
but it wasn't taken into account.

418
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:40.000
One comment that kept coming up.
because you'd hear people saying it. was.

419
00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.400
"She's not speaking up.
It had to be her because…"

420
00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.920
She didn't show any remorse.

421
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.360
She didn't give off a sense of injustice.

422
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:54.120
And that always really influences a jury.

423
00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:01.600
The fact
that Dolores Vázquez was a lesbian

424
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:06.160
was used during the trial
almost as a way to attack her.

425
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:12.080
REPRESSED HOMOSEXUALS EXHIBIT

426
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.240
MORE EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE

427
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.760
It was a way of showing
that Dolores Vázquez fit the profile

428
00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.800
and was capable
of murdering Rocío Wanninkhof.

429
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.000
AS THE VICTIM IS ON HER RIGHT SIDE

430
00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.880
SUGGESTS HOMOSEXUAL ASSAULT

431
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.120
THE HOMOSEXUAL

432
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.280
CAUSES OUTBURSTS OF VIOLENCE

433
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:38.240
When we had visitors or someone came over.

434
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.320
she'd introduce me as her sister

435
00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.960
because she was ashamed
of our relationship.

436
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.960
Would you say
she never accepted her sexual orientation?

437
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.280
I think she had issues with it.

438
00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.880
I did not kill Rocío. I did not see Rocío.

439
00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:02.120
All I ask of you.
of Spain. of all of Spain.

440
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.400
because a lot has been said about me.

441
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.040
is that you look for whoever did this.
because it wasn't me.

442
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.120
Whoever did this is out there.

443
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.200
Maybe even in this courtroom.

444
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.680
There was never any evidence against me.

445
00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.400
There never will be. because I'm innocent.

446
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.200
Do you see any proof?

447
00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:38.080
You're in there. too.
Do you see any conclusive evidence?

448
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.200
Anything that could send
my sister to prison?

449
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.000
I mean. you're journalists. aren't you?

450
00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.560
I want her to get at least 20 years.

451
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.520
Because in 20 years.
will I get my daughter back?

452
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.080
That won't happen in 14 years
or even in 30. Not ever.

453
00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.160
The top story this afternoon
is the verdict that will be handed down

454
00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.240
at the Provincial Court of Málaga.

455
00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:06.400
You can see how many members of the press
and cameramen are outside the courtroom.

456
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.480
We the jury.
by majority verdict. find the accused.

457
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.600
Ms. Dolores Vázquez Mosquera…

458
00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.440
guilty on the count of murder.

459
00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.120
I said to my sister.
"Jose. we're going to win."

460
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.520
"Well. this isn't a win.
but justice will be done."

461
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.800
And she said. "I'm not so sure."

462
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.600
And I said. "Justice will be done."

463
00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.240
And it was. Thank God.

464
00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.120
I can see the prosecutor
for this very complex case is here.

465
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.560
Maybe we can talk.

466
00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:23.680
How do you feel about the sentence?
Your first impression.

467
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.360
I recommended 15 years.
so 15 years and one day isn't bad.

468
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.840
Murderer!

469
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:39.880
I remember everything about that day.

470
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.840
Exactly as it happened.

471
00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:49.480
I got up in the morning. and I went
to her room. and she wasn't there.

472
00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:00.200
I called her friends.
and her friends didn't--

473
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.960
They told me
they'd walked her to the door.

474
00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.960
I said. "Well. she isn't here."

475
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.440
So I looked out.

476
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:15.200
and three doors down from my house.

477
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.320
well. next to the tree was

478
00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.560
her shoe.

479
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.680
her purse.

480
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.840
her phone. on the ground.

481
00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:32.520
My husband's car had blood on it.
and our neighbor's car did too.

482
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.880
It was August 14.
the last day of the fair.

483
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.160
and at around four. I got a call
from a reporter with Cadena SER.

484
00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:52.120
asking what I knew about a girl
who had gone missing from the Coín fair.

485
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.760
I told him that I didn't have
any information about that

486
00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.280
and that no girl
had been reported missing in Coín.

487
00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.800
He assured me one had.

488
00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:08.960
I started seeing vehicles
and media broadcast trucks.

489
00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:14.800
That put me on my guard.
and I naturally started feeling uneasy.

490
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.080
I asked to speak to the police chief.

491
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:21.960
That's when he told me
Sonia had disappeared early that morning.

492
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.480
that her parents had reported her missing.
and that they were investigating

493
00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.360
and making initial inquiries.

494
00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.200
-Here. or down there?
-A little closer.

495
00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.200
-A little closer. please.
-Sure.

496
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.600
Here. stand together. Too close?

497
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.000
-It's fine.
-Just moving the mic closer.

498
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.280
-We'll stay put.
-All set.

499
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.080
-Okay.
-We still don't know anything yet.

500
00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:59.520
All I'm saying is.
if someone knows anything at all--

501
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:04.960
a friend. because one of her friends
must have seen or heard something or--

502
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.240
Please say something and let her go.

503
00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:11.880
Let her go
because we've had enough of all this.

504
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.960
Because this is a lot. This is too much.

505
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.120
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

506
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.280
-Thanks. you guys.
-Thank you.

507
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.560
-Is this okay?
-Yeah. Great.

508
00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.400
Now point it over there.
Down there. towards Lucerne.

509
00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.600
Slowly.

510
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.480
-The lake.
-The lake. right?

511
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.440
The boats.

512
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.240
Well. we got married in Coín.

513
00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.920
And my husband had a job in Switzerland.

514
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.440
so I went with him.

515
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.040
And my three kids were born there.

516
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.400
The two older ones first.
and then my Sonia.

517
00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.640
That's enough!

518
00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.960
Enough!

519
00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.680
That's enough!

520
00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.720
Come on. say something.

521
00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:14.760
Hello.

522
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.760
We had jobs there. and…

523
00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.240
-Is it recording?
-Yeah.

524
00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.040
…we lived there for 26 years.

525
00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.160
It's a quarter to eight.

526
00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.760
Let's go. Let's get going. everybody.

527
00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:43.080
And when the older two
had finished school.

528
00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:47.600
Sonia wanted to move to Spain.

529
00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.680
And. well. we did too.

530
00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.880
And so we came back here in 2000. 2001.

531
00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.800
And she adjusted well.

532
00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:01.280
Of course. she had friends here
from when we used to come on vacation.

533
00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.560
She had her cousins. She had--

534
00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:06.160
she planned to continue high school

535
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.040
and get her diploma or…

536
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.080
But that wasn't to be.

537
00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.640
As the hours go by.
despair is setting in for the family

538
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.400
of the 17-year-old girl who went missing
in Coín. Málaga. yesterday.

539
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.960
A thorough search of the area is still on.

540
00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:38.200
but her belongings do not bode well.
since some were found stained with blood.

541
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.040
I remember there was a light cover
in the Sonia Carabantes case.

542
00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:52.840
I know for a fact
that Civil Guard officers were sent

543
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.240
to make inquiries
at every mechanic in Málaga

544
00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:01.720
to see if a car matching the description
had been taken to get a light cover fixed.

545
00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.640
We launched
several lines of investigation.

546
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.320
such as one
into a series of sexual assaults committed

547
00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.960
near Torremolinos and Benalmádena.

548
00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.600
We also linked it
to the disappearance of a girl in Motril

549
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:21.200
because the girls had
a fairly similar profile.

550
00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.080
So. considering that they went missing
while a fair was going on.

551
00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.080
we started looking into

552
00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:32.000
all the fair workers
who had been in Motril or Coín.

553
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.960
Go up. Report if you see anything.

554
00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.400
If you do. treat it as important.
even if you think it isn't.

555
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:43.320
Everything is important.
Clothing. a shoe. anything at all.

556
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.200
Call me. and I'll run down.

557
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.760
People stepped up.

558
00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.880
I mean. they. the public as a whole.

559
00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.080
were clear about saying.

560
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:09.120
"This is a local girl.
and this is a family who needs our help."

561
00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:14.960
And they began to get involved
and donate not just their time.

562
00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.280
but everything
that might be needed for the search.

563
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.640
When you watched from the upstairs window.
or as the day went by. it was moving.

564
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.320
And I still find it moving.

565
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.600
The fact was that a girl had gone missing

566
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.280
and we had to find her.

567
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.280
I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart

568
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.920
for everything you're doing.
from the youngest to the oldest.

569
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.040
You're making an incredible effort.

570
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.680
And I don't know how to thank you
because that's all I can think to say.

571
00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:56.400
Apart from that. the Civil Guard continued
their inquiries and investigations.

572
00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.800
But the most important thing
was finding her alive.

573
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.880
Did they find her?

574
00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:25.480
People from Madrid said she was found.
but it hasn't been confirmed yet.

575
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.480
But she's been found. Yeah.

576
00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.720
-But where?
-They don't know.

577
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.200
We need to run over there.
They called from Madrid.

578
00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:44.120
Today at noon. the body
of a young woman was found near Coín.

579
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.240
Turn it up!

580
00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:50.280
Reports have not been confirmed.
but they fear it may be Sonia Carabantes.

581
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.840
the 17-year-old
who went missing on Thursday.

582
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.520
A woman's body has been found.

583
00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.920
We fear the worst.
but we're still awaiting confirmation.

584
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.320
The judge just arrived.
The judicial police are investigating.

585
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.480
I've been in contact
with the government subdelegate.

586
00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.880
He told me that.
as soon as he heard the news.

587
00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:15.200
he sent a forensic unit here

588
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.600
and he'll be there
for whatever the family or I need.

589
00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.680
There they go.

590
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:51.440
It was near Monda. the town next to ours.

591
00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:56.680
And they found her in a stream with--

592
00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:00.000
Rocks had been put on top of her. and--

593
00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.200
Well. it had rained a bit
the night before.

594
00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.880
and a lot had been washed away.

595
00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.520
but the dogs had--

596
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.280
they'd already searched there. but--

597
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:16.600
but that day. well.
they found her there under the rocks.

598
00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:42.360
The victim
had been at the Coín fair that day.

599
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:45.920
She said goodbye to her friends
just meters from her house.

600
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.200
and she was attacked by the perpetrator.

601
00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:56.760
He struck her.
leaving her partially unconscious.

602
00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.920
She couldn't have been fully alert
because this was a brutal attack.

603
00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.160
She tried to defend herself.
He put her in the car.

604
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:09.520
And he took her
at least some 11.5 kilometers away

605
00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.160
to a secluded location.

606
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.920
There. we know he inflicted
both internal and external injuries

607
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:22.200
and strangled her with a T-shirt.
which. ultimately. was the cause of death.

608
00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.880
Everyone was shocked.

609
00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.840
It was a situation
where everyone was on edge.

610
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:05.000
Girls wouldn't go to the fair.
to parties. or even out of their homes.

611
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.960
There was a sense of fear.

612
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.920
an ongoing sense of fear.
but not just in Coín.

613
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.560
in the neighboring towns as well.

614
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.920
Not good because I have
two nieces and a daughter. and--

615
00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.520
Yeah. I'm a bit concerned.

616
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:27.680
They say it must be someone close to her
because she was found not far from Coín.

617
00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.640
We don't know who this man is.

618
00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.880
He's still out there. and the girls--

619
00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.600
I have a 15-year-old daughter too.

620
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.280
I'm pretty worried.

621
00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.920
The fact that Sonia was found quickly

622
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:48.280
meant it was possible to obtain. examine.
and analyze the forensic evidence.

623
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.560
At a meeting we held
at the government subdelegation office.

624
00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.640
Colonel Paco Gabella told us

625
00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:59.680
that some trace evidence had been found
on Sonia Carabantes's hands.

626
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.520
This biological material
was analyzed right away.

627
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:08.360
and it was entered into
the criminal DNA database.

628
00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.640
And it was compared.

629
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.400
With what?

630
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:17.440
Another genetic profile on file.
obtained from the cigarette butt

631
00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.560
found 2.5 meters from the bloodstain

632
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:23.480
in the vacant lot
from the Rocío Wanninkhof case.

633
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:29.000
When they compared
the two genetic profiles.

634
00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.120
they found they were a perfect match.

635
00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:36.200
DNA OF A MALE

636
00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:41.600
The person in that vacant lot in 1999

637
00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:47.520
was the same one who had attacked
and killed Sonia Carabantes.

638
00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:55.200
I believe we were the first ones
to report that there was a DNA match.

639
00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.720
That--

640
00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:01.320
Well. that was a bombshell.

641
00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.600
Things are coming to light.

642
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.960
An English cigarette butt. traces of skin
under Sonia Carabantes's nails.

643
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.200
The DNA obtained from both
belongs to the same person.

644
00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:14.360
There was something to connect
the disappearances.

645
00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:15.960
Something

646
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.120
so serious. so painful…

647
00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.480
and something so awful as well.

648
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:30.000
All the more so for the person
who had spent 17 months in prison.

649
00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:35.400
And from that point forward.
things started moving at a dizzying pace.

650
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.400
GUILTY

651
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:40.600
15 YEARS FOR MURDER

652
00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:45.200
I hope
that whoever is guilty pays for this

653
00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.720
and serves the full sentence.

654
00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.400
During the 14-day trial.
the cigarette butt never came up.

655
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.920
A lot of nonsense did. but not that.

656
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.640
The question is whether emerging evidence

657
00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.520
will exonerate
the accused. Dolores Vázquez.

658
00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:07.280
When faced with that impasse
in the investigation.

659
00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:10.760
we got a call
from the police station in Fuengirola.

660
00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.640
asking if I could please head over there

661
00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.640
since there was
a Chilean-born British woman

662
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.640
who wanted to speak with us
to give us some information.

663
00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:34.120
Cecilia King. a little anxious and nervous
about what she was going to tell us.

664
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.080
recalled that.

665
00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:40.480
when her ex-husband had come
to pick up or drop off her daughter.

666
00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:45.360
she had seen a scar
or injury on the back of his left hand.

667
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.880
Once we had taken Cecilia's statement.

668
00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:22.120
I spoke to a British colleague.
John O'Neill. who was at the embassy.

669
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.840
and I asked him about Tony Alexander King.

670
00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:50.160
He told me that they knew Tony
by the name of Tony Bromwich

671
00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:53.360
and that he'd committed
sexual assaults in London.

672
00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:59.800
This made us all the more certain
that we were on the right track.

673
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.720
We found out he worked at a pub

674
01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.680
and he lived with a Spanish girl
in Alhaurín el Grande.

675
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.800
We set up surveillance at the pub.

676
01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.600
We saw him go to work.
and. when he finished his shift.

677
01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.120
we were surprised to see
he went to a school.

678
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.920
There was a house
at the school. which is where he lived.

679
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:33.400
He had a car on the grounds.

680
01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.600
It was a Mazda with British plates

681
01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.160
and a broken light cover.

682
01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.640
-I can't talk.
-You can't talk?

683
01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:01.640
So we were sure that he was the one behind
those two disappearances and deaths.

684
01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.000
When King was arrested.

685
01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:47.680
Dolores had already been released.
awaiting retrial

686
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.280
because the High Court of Justice
of Andalusia had overturned the verdict.

687
01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.200
Why?

688
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.760
Because the jury
only had circumstantial evidence.

689
01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.880
But what's more. they didn't state
what had actually convinced them

690
01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:04.280
to declare Dolores Vázquez guilty.

691
01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:33.520
I wouldn't wish prison on anyone.
I've been through some terrible times.

692
01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:39.000
Many months. I'd rather not talk about it.

693
01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.720
HOME OF DOLORES VÁZQUEZ

694
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.800
I spent two months. three months
in solitary confinement.

695
01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.440
What else is there to say?

696
01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.440
I'm not saying
that I was wrongfully arrested.

697
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.920
Anyone. if I were one of the suspects--

698
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.680
I had nothing to hide.
just like I have nothing to hide today.

699
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.600
I went in for questioning.
and they began interrogating me

700
01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.440
and saying. "It was you."

701
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:10.080
It was very intensive brainwashing.

702
01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.680
They described the process I'd go through.

703
01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.680
They said they'd make me infamous
and that no one would believe me.

704
01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.800
They'd take me to court.
A quick five- or six-month trial.

705
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.160
and I'd be found guilty by a jury.

706
01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.720
Well. that's how it happened.

707
01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.040
I feel that the verdict.

708
01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:38.920
aside from having
a clear lack of sufficient grounds.

709
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.520
was not impartial.

710
01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.040
To put it another way.
just think of how many TV programs

711
01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:48.880
directly accused Dolores Vázquez
without any evidence.

712
01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.000
All this information.
all that public opinion

713
01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.160
that the press and TV put out there

714
01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:58.120
was read. seen. and heard

715
01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.520
by the members of the jury
and the judge every day.

716
01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:08.880
When the real killer was found
and it was clear Dolores wasn't involved.

717
01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:12.960
I started to think. and I realized

718
01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:16.840
how I had internalized all the homophobia

719
01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:21.480
that the media
and others had been spewing.

720
01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.480
How I had believed information

721
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:27.160
that wasn't information.
just prejudice. you know?

722
01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.880
So I began researching
what had been said in the media.

723
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.400
and I was a bit shocked.

724
01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.280
And I decided to write a book.

725
01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:38.920
TRIAL IN THE STREET

726
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.440
Over time.
Dolores Vázquez was being attributed

727
01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:45.440
qualities that were perceived
as masculine.

728
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.320
Some were totally ridiculous.

729
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.560
Some of the things they said.
if you look at them--

730
01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:55.640
for example. they pointed out
she did karate. as if it was a bad thing.

731
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.000
Or that she worked out.

732
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.920
That she had a raspy voice.
was commanding. and had authority.

733
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.960
With all this together. they tried
to paint a picture of a masculine woman.

734
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.840
with the negative connotations
that could have.

735
01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:19.360
They called her barren. jealous of a woman
who gave birth and could be a mother.

736
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.320
They said they were
unhealthy couples that had

737
01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.440
unhealthy relationships
that can lead to murder.

738
01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.680
All that outrage actually stemmed

739
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:31.920
from a social climate that couldn't accept
that type of relationship.

740
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.280
Is it possible that the relationship
between Rocío and Dolores Vázquez

741
01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.720
was rocky because.
deep down. your daughter didn't accept

742
01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.880
you being romantically involved
with another woman?

743
01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.880
We were shocked.

744
01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.720
If you're accusing the wrong person.

745
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.400
if you don't have enough evidence.

746
01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.000
at least don't accuse someone else. right?

747
01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.920
Because if they had made that known.

748
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:08.720
or investigated further
and not focused on just one person.

749
01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.360
they'd have found him.

750
01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.960
Then. what happened
to my daughter would've been avoided.

751
01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.520
When they finally arrested

752
01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.360
that criminal.

753
01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.480
there started to be talk

754
01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:59.360
that Interpol
had asked Spain about his whereabouts.

755
01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.360
When we heard here in Spain
that there had been a report.

756
01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:09.200
naturally.
it gave rise to a certain level of fear.

757
01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.040
The case was used for political ends

758
01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:15.760
by both the party in power
and the opposition party.

759
01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.000
through a parliamentary inquiry
to Minister of the Interior. Ángel Acebes.

760
01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.320
on this case
and why they had not intervened.

761
01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.880
The King case
was discussed in the Chamber of Deputies.

762
01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.160
Yes. Ángel Acebes appeared
before Parliament on his own initiative

763
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.600
to explain the investigation
into the murders

764
01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:35.640
of Rocío Wanninkhof and Sonia Carabantes.

765
01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.120
The minister explained
that British police had sent a memo

766
01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.560
requesting confirmation
that he was living in Spain

767
01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.000
and mentioning crimes
of which he was accused.

768
01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.560
But since British police had classified it

769
01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.200
as a low-level matter
and hadn't requested extradition.

770
01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:54.840
it was considered resolved
once King's address was confirmed.

771
01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:23.120
Mr. Minister.
on September 15. 1998. Scotland Yard

772
01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:28.920
located Anthony Alexander King
in Mijas through you.

773
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.600
You were notified as to who he was

774
01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.680
and of his conviction
and the danger he posed.

775
01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:40.560
The British police also said. "He's
a potential threat to women in Spain."

776
01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:43.600
But what doesn't add up
is the enormity of the fact

777
01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:47.960
that a dangerous criminal was identified

778
01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.040
but it wasn't registered
or reported correctly.

779
01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.040
A memo from Interpol cannot be handled

780
01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.840
how it was
by the police under your leadership.

781
01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:03.040
It's true that we received a fax
from Interpol. out of London.

782
01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:07.800
informing us that Tony Alexander King--
not to arrest him but to look into him.

783
01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:10.160
We didn't hear back from them.

784
01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:16.520
But that's normal because we get
lots of faxes coming in from Interpol

785
01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.280
about all sorts
of people being on the Costa del Sol.

786
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:24.480
Not just those involved
in sex crimes. but also drug trafficking.

787
01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.520
homicide. fraud. all sorts of crimes.

788
01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.880
These were blameworthy acts

789
01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:36.520
that have brought suffering.
especially to the families

790
01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.400
of Rocío Wanninkhof and Sonia Carabantes.

791
01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:44.760
and also
another individual. Dolores Vázquez.

792
01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.680
who has probably been to hell and back.

793
01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:53.680
If we apply the standard premises
for any investigation

794
01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.840
to the Rocío Wanninkhof case.

795
01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:58.240
we can conclude that the Civil Guard

796
01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.800
steered the investigation
to focus on Dolores Vázquez.

797
01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:09.000
who seemed to fit
the most plausible criminal profile.

798
01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.040
The authorities
have never apologized to me.

799
01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.600
nor has Minister Acebes.
who thinks he knows everything.

800
01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.960
They haven't contacted me at all.

801
01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.840
Did I have to lose my daughter

802
01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:31.880
so they could finally catch that killer?

803
01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.160
I mean. they caught him
because my daughter defended herself.

804
01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:05.720
I'm telling you. I didn't send
María Dolores Vázquez to prison.

805
01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.480
The police told me they were going
to lock up Dolores Vázquez.

806
01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.240
That she was the suspect.

807
01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.560
That she was Rocío's killer.

808
01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:20.200
So. if anyone owes that lady an apology.
it's the police.

809
01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:23.760
I don't owe anybody an apology.
I didn't lock anyone up.

810
01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.120
Be strong!

811
01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:42.120
I'm innocent!

812
01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.680
It was a disturbing trial

813
01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.120
because it's not something
you see every day. fortunately.

814
01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.960
It was a very serious matter

815
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.760
since it seemed
the victim was chosen at random.

816
01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:03.520
Which means this happened to this person
due to pure chance. right?

817
01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.680
And that impacts you on every level.

818
01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.880
as a judge and as a human being.

819
01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:18.920
I believe the evidence was so solid
that he ended up incriminating himself.

820
01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:22.800
Maybe because he felt
like the center of attention.

821
01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.680
I remember seeing him on TV.

822
01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:29.720
addressing the media
while being transferred into a police van.

823
01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:32.280
But it was out of a desire for attention.

824
01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:37.600
rather than a sense of remorse
or because he felt he'd done wrong.

825
01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:54.800
I've spent seven years. two months. and
12 days wondering who killed my daughter.

826
01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:58.960
-What do you want from this trial?
-Justice.

827
01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.560
Justice for my daughter. once and for all.

828
01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:09.040
In one of Tony King's
statements to investigators.

829
01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.640
he tried to incriminate Dolores Vázquez

830
01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:16.960
and drag her back
into these judicial proceedings.

831
01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.000
I don't know anything about this man.
I don't know anything.

832
01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.720
All I know is that I was lynched once.

833
01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:27.440
and I'm scared to death
it'll happen again.

834
01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.480
I am innocent!

835
01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.040
I want the court
to recognize my innocence.

836
01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.840
I shouldn't have to be here.
explaining myself!

837
01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:37.280
I shouldn't have to explain anything!

838
01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:42.720
But public opinion
and Spanish society demand.

839
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:46.200
that. on top of everything else.
I prove my innocence.

840
01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:49.480
For my Rocío. poor Sonia.
and so many other women.

841
01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:54.200
No. He acted on his own. Always.

842
01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:57.800
He acted on his own.
Every time he went out. he went alone.

843
01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:03.520
And he captured those girls.
assaulted them. and killed them.

844
01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:09.080
Dolores Vázquez had very bad
but also very good luck.

845
01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:13.400
She could still be in jail
or have been released just recently.

846
01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:17.600
A retrial was ordered.
Who knows what the outcome would've been.

847
01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:23.200
But if the true culprit hadn't been found.
we don't know what would've happened.

848
01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:28.720
Today. the Court of Málaga
exonerated Dolores Vázquez

849
01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.920
of the murder of Rocío Wanninkhof.

850
01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:36.200
This is the end of a four-year ordeal
for Dolores Vázquez.

851
01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:46.280
I'll bet anyone. we can settle it in the
newspaper archive. that Dolores's arrest

852
01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.440
takes up
many more pages than her acquittal.

853
01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:56.920
The journalists who had written
just offensive. horrible things about her

854
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.640
didn't say. "We were wrong. How awful.
How could we get so carried away?"

855
01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:05.800
Which is what I.
or those in the movement. might say.

856
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:11.760
"How awful. We were so wrong.
How could even we get swept up in it all?"

857
01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.360
No one really said that.

858
01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:16.440
It was like.
"Let's move on. We found the killer."

859
01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:18.520
"Forget that lady. Let's move on."

860
01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.680
And yeah. that's terrible too.

861
01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.640
The one who causes harm
should be the first to apologize.

862
01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:27.320
And the system obviously caused the harm.

863
01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:30.760
As far as I know.
the state hasn't given her compensation.

864
01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.400
I think that's a huge mistake.

865
01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:49.160
I talk to this photo a lot.

866
01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:53.880
Since she's always laughing. I say.
"You're always laughing at your mom."

867
01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:56.600
I tell her. "You look so gorgeous. honey."

868
01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.520
"You're so pretty.
How sad you're not here with me."

869
01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:06.520
And she seems to smile and understand.

870
01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.120
She was a joy.

871
01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:17.960
and she was always giving me kisses
and hugs and saying. "You're so pretty."

872
01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.480
That was her.

873
01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.720
And now.
well. I'm alone. without my little girl.

874
01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:32.920
People say.
"You're strong. So is your husband."

875
01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:38.480
It's not that I'm strong.
I just have no choice but to keep going.

876
01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.400
My fight isn't over.

877
01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.200
It's not about financial compensation.

878
01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:47.120
It's more about showing Spanish society

879
01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.640
that I am totally innocent
and always have been.

880
01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:55.560
So when I walk down the street.
people won't give each other nudges.

881
01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:59.640
Or if I go
to try on shoes at El Corte Inglés.

882
01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.840
just to name a store.

883
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.360
and within 20 minutes.
I'm surrounded by women.

884
01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.920
"Look who it is."

885
01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:13.200
I'm still waiting
for someone to ask for my forgiveness.

886
01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:06.120
