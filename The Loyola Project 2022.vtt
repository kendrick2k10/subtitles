March Madness for a reason.

[spectators cheering]

7
00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:39.256
And every tournament is better
with an underdog. right?

[spectators cheering]

9
00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:46.829
- [Reporter] The hottest thing
in Chicago sports right now

10
00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:49.919
isn't the Cubs. the Sox. the
Bulls. or the Blackhawks.

11
00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:51.268
- [Announcer] Here comes
the player of the year

12
00:00:51.312 --> 00:00:53.662
of the MVC. he rises. oh!

13
00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.185
- [Reporter] It's the Loyola
Ramblers.

14
00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.100
- [Announcer] And the dream is
alive!

15
00:00:58.101 --> 00:00:59.798
[players cheering]

16
00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:01.626
- [Lucas] But our journey
was more important

17
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.888
than the buzzer beaters.

18
00:01:02.932 --> 00:01:05.935
- [Announcer] Townes for three.
yes!

19
00:01:07.763 --> 00:01:09.895
- [Lucas] With every round we
advanced.

20
00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.897
we were reminded of our past.

21
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:15.249
[gentle upbeat music]

22
00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:16.163
- [Announcer] Away we go.

23
00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:19.514
Loyola Chicago controls the tip.

24
00:01:19.557 --> 00:01:22.343
- [Red] Egan. Egan to Harkness.
turnaround jumper's good.

25
00:01:22.386 --> 00:01:25.955
Jerry made his first basket.
he made it. he might do it.

26
00:01:25.998 --> 00:01:29.263
- When you study the
early days of basketball.

27
00:01:29.306 --> 00:01:31.221
Loyola Chicago sticks out.

28
00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:33.180
The youth of America. they need
to know

29
00:01:33.223 --> 00:01:34.790
what that generation went
through.

30
00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:37.053
and they need to carry the
baton.

31
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.576
- Jerry Harkness was the captain

32
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.709
of that Loyola team and joins us
now.

33
00:01:40.752 --> 00:01:43.103
What a pleasure it is to meet
you. sir.

34
00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:44.582
- It's a pleasure to be here.

35
00:01:45.496 --> 00:01:47.846
- [Announcer] Custer looking
for help. gets it. Williamson.

36
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.328
[spectators cheering]

37
00:01:51.372 --> 00:01:53.461
- [Lucas] My name is Lucas
Williamson.

38
00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:56.638
I was a freshman in 2018
when the Loyola Ramblers

39
00:01:56.681 --> 00:01:58.727
made it to the Final Four.

40
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.210
for the first time in 55 years.

41
00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:07.736
We were always told how
the '63 team made history.

42
00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:10.565
but it was in the forgotten
details

43
00:02:10.608 --> 00:02:12.741
that I found a deeper
connection.

44
00:02:12.784 --> 00:02:15.700
- [Ross] My absolute
and unshakeable stance

45
00:02:15.744 --> 00:02:19.269
for segregation of the
races at all levels.

46
00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:20.270
- [Man] Go home. nigger.

47
00:02:20.314 --> 00:02:22.664
- This is not 200 years ago.

48
00:02:22.707 --> 00:02:24.231
These are our fathers and our
grandfathers

49
00:02:24.274 --> 00:02:26.189
that have gone through this.

50
00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:29.149
- This was more than a
game. this was history.

51
00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:32.369
- [Lucas] It's time the rest of
the world

52
00:02:32.413 --> 00:02:33.805
hears their whole story.

53
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.808
about those who changed the
game.

54
00:02:39.028 --> 00:02:40.943
by playing it their way.

55
00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:43.641
[upbeat music]

56
00:02:44.816 --> 00:02:48.168
[gentle dramatic music]

57
00:02:54.957 --> 00:02:56.263
[gentle bright music]

58
00:02:56.306 --> 00:03:00.136
The story of any great
team begins with the coach.

59
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.053
And in this case. a day
he would never forget.

60
00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:09.667
- It is very hard for me to
think back to that day in 1959.

61
00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:13.410
I was in nursing school at
Loyola.

62
00:03:13.454 --> 00:03:15.630
And I came out of class the one
day.

63
00:03:15.673 --> 00:03:18.720
and it was just a regular
kind of autumn day.

64
00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:21.592
My dad was George Ireland.

65
00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:24.856
He was the Loyola
University basketball coach.

66
00:03:25.857 --> 00:03:28.730
There was something
different about Dad that day.

67
00:03:28.773 --> 00:03:32.081
I don't know if something
happened at practice. at school.

68
00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:35.432
but I walked over towards Dad's
office

69
00:03:35.476 --> 00:03:37.129
and I looked up and I thought.

70
00:03:37.173 --> 00:03:38.914
"Well. what on Earth can that
be?"

71
00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:46.574
And it was a hanging effigy of
my father.

72
00:03:48.445 --> 00:03:51.753
I thought. "How could
someone do that to my dad?"

73
00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:57.019
- [John] There were chants.
"Get rid of Ireland."

74
00:03:57.062 --> 00:03:58.760
"We need a new coach."

75
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.372
- Those students were totally
unhappy.

76
00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:04.026
They wanted him out.

77
00:04:05.288 --> 00:04:09.074
His job was in jeopardy
because he was losing.

78
00:04:09.118 --> 00:04:13.427
- We played hard. but we
didn't have a lot of talent.

79
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.865
He had to start bringing new
players in.

80
00:04:17.996 --> 00:04:20.956
- George Ireland had to
confront all this stuff.

81
00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:24.133
He knew if he kept going
the way he was going.

82
00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:25.308
he was done as a coach.

83
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.617
[bright upbeat music]

84
00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.711
The one thing about basketball

85
00:04:36.754 --> 00:04:40.018
is all you need is that
backboard and hoop. and a ball.

86
00:04:40.062 --> 00:04:42.847
In cities where there's a big
population.

87
00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:46.373
not much space. well.
it's the perfect game.

88
00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:49.463
- The best players in the
country were from Harlem.

89
00:04:49.506 --> 00:04:51.813
They were playing a style of
basketball

90
00:04:51.856 --> 00:04:54.250
that was up-tempo and
fast-paced.

91
00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.425
- [Michael] One of the best ways

92
00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:56.905
that I've heard it described

93
00:04:56.948 --> 00:05:00.735
is the old school basketball
was played on the floor

94
00:05:00.778 --> 00:05:03.868
and modern basketball
was played in the air.

95
00:05:03.912 --> 00:05:07.089
[bright upbeat music]

96
00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.745
- It felt like the early
style of basketball

97
00:05:10.788 --> 00:05:13.356
was like some sort of
exercise in calisthenics.

98
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.662
You know. people stretching

99
00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:17.665
and there wasn't very
much athleticism to it.

100
00:05:17.708 --> 00:05:21.451
- [Rick] George Ireland was
losing. teams weren't very good.

101
00:05:21.495 --> 00:05:26.413
We're playing staid.
feet-in-the-mud-in-concrete
basketball.

102
00:05:26.456 --> 00:05:27.936
And it's time to change.

103
00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.895
These black players were
changing the game

104
00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.072
and they were making it so
exciting.

105
00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:39.121
- This was a time when
superstars
were heavily recruited.

106
00:05:39.643 --> 00:05:41.645
[bright upbeat music continues]

107
00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:44.474
Wilt Chamberlain. Oscar
Robertson.

108
00:05:44.518 --> 00:05:46.346
everybody knew who these guys
were.

109
00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.522
a lot of coaches wanted them.

110
00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:51.829
But for the next tier of players
down.

111
00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:55.398
black guys who were merely
excellent basketball players.

112
00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:57.574
nobody wanted them.

113
00:05:57.618 --> 00:05:59.837
- For the black athlete. the
landscape

114
00:05:59.881 --> 00:06:02.231
of these kids playing
on university campuses

115
00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:04.668
or in the NBA just wasn't there.

116
00:06:04.712 --> 00:06:07.497
George Ireland was thinking
about job security.

117
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:10.282
He just wanted to win and
he didn't care who you were.

118
00:06:11.283 --> 00:06:15.287
[bright upbeat music continues]

119
00:06:17.594 --> 00:06:20.858
- My father. Jerry Harkness.
was born in Harlem. New York.

120
00:06:20.902 --> 00:06:25.907
And he lived in very harsh
conditions in the projects.

121
00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:29.563
He's ultra competitive.
and I've always wondered

122
00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:32.522
where did that competitive
drive come from?

123
00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:33.697
The resilience?

124
00:06:34.742 --> 00:06:36.787
- [Lucas] As a child in the
1940s.

125
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:38.441
Jerry remembers his own father

126
00:06:38.485 --> 00:06:41.357
returning home from the war a
hero.

127
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.620
But the fanfare faded. and soon

128
00:06:43.664 --> 00:06:46.449
he was just a young black
man trying to build a life.

129
00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:49.931
- He did everything to try to
get work.

130
00:06:49.974 --> 00:06:52.716
The more Italian and Irish come
in.

131
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.023
the less work he would have.

132
00:06:55.066 --> 00:07:00.071
He could not take that
pressure and he left us.

133
00:07:01.856 --> 00:07:03.988
My mom was a go-getter.

134
00:07:04.032 --> 00:07:07.644
and she pretty much had
to be when my dad left.

135
00:07:07.688 --> 00:07:12.693
And I could see her really
trying to keep it all together.

136
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:17.437
- [Lucas] The financial
stress was overwhelming.

137
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.483
At one point. his mother
had a mental breakdown

138
00:07:20.527 --> 00:07:23.094
and admitted herself
into Bellevue Hospital.

139
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:28.230
- When she got out. I
looked her in the eyes.

140
00:07:28.273 --> 00:07:31.146
I knew that we were gonna be all
right.

141
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:34.018
She said. "I'm gonna get a
job. we're gonna make it.

142
00:07:34.062 --> 00:07:38.327
We're not gonna depend on
anybody but the three of us."

143
00:07:40.895 --> 00:07:44.289
To see her go through
what she went through.

144
00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:49.338
I said. "If she can do things
like that. I can make it."

145
00:07:49.643 --> 00:07:51.166
[solemn music]

146
00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:53.124
- [Lucas] Young Jerry
loved playing basketball

147
00:07:53.168 --> 00:07:55.518
on the streets of Harlem.
but he never figured

148
00:07:55.562 --> 00:07:58.695
he was good enough to
make his high school team.

149
00:07:58.739 --> 00:08:00.784
To him. the game was an escape.

150
00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:04.135
And when he'd save up a quarter.

151
00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:06.311
he'd go practice alone at the Y.

152
00:08:06.355 --> 00:08:08.836
[basketball thudding]

153
00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:12.927
- I could still see myself
bouncing back and forth.

154
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.146
and then going up for the shot.

155
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.888
saying "Good. we win."

156
00:08:19.803 --> 00:08:22.980
All of a sudden. a guy
hit me on my shoulder.

157
00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:26.201
and he said. "Hey. you're pretty
good."

158
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:30.814
My eyes got wide. my mouth
jumped open.

159
00:08:31.989 --> 00:08:36.777
It was my hero.
[spectators cheering]

160
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.082
Jackie Robinson.

161
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.785
So when a guy like that
tells me I'm not that bad.

162
00:08:45.568 --> 00:08:47.570
maybe he's right.

163
00:08:47.614 --> 00:08:50.660
I said. "I'm going out for the
team."

164
00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:54.621
My coach. he asked me.
"Are you set for college?"

165
00:08:54.664 --> 00:08:56.710
I said. "No. I don't have any
offer."

166
00:08:56.753 --> 00:08:59.669
He said. "We're gonna work on
that."

167
00:08:59.713 --> 00:09:01.889
George Ireland was coming up to
Harlem

168
00:09:01.932 --> 00:09:03.543
to watch the ball players.

169
00:09:03.586 --> 00:09:06.763
My coach told him. "There's a
guy here

170
00:09:06.807 --> 00:09:08.765
that doesn't have the
recognition

171
00:09:08.809 --> 00:09:12.595
the other players have because
he only played one year.

172
00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:14.292
Why don't you give him a
chance?"

173
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.210
So I was trying to impress this
guy

174
00:09:20.081 --> 00:09:23.084
like he was the man that had my
future.

175
00:09:23.127 --> 00:09:26.304
because this was pretty
much my last chance.

176
00:09:27.654 --> 00:09:30.178
If I don't get this. I'm
finished.

177
00:09:33.007 --> 00:09:36.097
- [John] And that was the
beginning of Jerry Harkness.

178
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.881
- [Lucas] With Jerry joining the
Ramblers.

179
00:09:37.925 --> 00:09:41.450
Coach Ireland developed a
whole new vision for his team.

180
00:09:41.493 --> 00:09:45.106
- Jerry was a speedster.

181
00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:47.412
- My father was a great track
athlete

182
00:09:47.456 --> 00:09:49.893
prior to becoming a basketball
player.

183
00:09:49.937 --> 00:09:52.853
- [John] We had to run two
miles every day before practice

184
00:09:52.896 --> 00:09:56.683
because of Harkness.
because he loved running.

185
00:09:56.726 --> 00:10:00.643
- I remember one coach said.
"Put the ball on the floor.

186
00:10:00.687 --> 00:10:04.995
Now pick it up. Jerry Harkness
just scored a bucket."

187
00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:07.215
- Jerry was kind of in command.

188
00:10:07.258 --> 00:10:10.479
You could see the growth
that was happening.

189
00:10:10.522 --> 00:10:12.481
- [Ron] And that was the
best season he had had

190
00:10:12.524 --> 00:10:15.658
in about five or six
years. that saved him.

191
00:10:16.703 --> 00:10:18.269
And then we came along.

192
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.926
- Ireland took me to a St.
Rita's game.

193
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.667
And I'm looking at the game and
I said.

194
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:26.669
"I know why he got me here."

195
00:10:28.192 --> 00:10:31.108
He didn't tell me who he was
scouting.

196
00:10:31.152 --> 00:10:33.458
but I was looking at these
brothers.

197
00:10:33.502 --> 00:10:35.156
the center and the forward.

198
00:10:35.199 --> 00:10:38.899
They were 6-10. they were tough.

199
00:10:38.942 --> 00:10:41.205
At the end of the game. he said.

200
00:10:41.249 --> 00:10:43.860
"What did you think of the
little guard?"

201
00:10:43.904 --> 00:10:45.949
[upbeat music]

202
00:10:45.993 --> 00:10:48.648
- I was from St. Rita's high
school. born in Chicago.

203
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:52.303
I loved basketball
because I was good at it.

204
00:10:52.347 --> 00:10:56.133
- I said to myself. "This
guy's not a ball player."

205
00:10:56.177 --> 00:10:58.092
I was wrong about that.

206
00:10:58.135 --> 00:10:59.920
- [Jerald] Don't let Jack
Egan's size fool you.

207
00:10:59.963 --> 00:11:01.791
He's incredibly athletic.

208
00:11:01.835 --> 00:11:04.489
- Jack Egan is no nonsense.

209
00:11:04.533 --> 00:11:08.102
He knows what he wants
and he is going to get it.

210
00:11:08.145 --> 00:11:09.277
- [Jack] And it's important

211
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.672
that you are not gonna be
intimidated.

212
00:11:12.715 --> 00:11:15.718
I needed some physical
contact with the other team

213
00:11:15.762 --> 00:11:17.589
even though it was basketball.

214
00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:20.157
I think I was fouled more
often than anybody else.

215
00:11:22.638 --> 00:11:24.074
- Les Hunter and Vic Rouse

216
00:11:24.118 --> 00:11:26.729
both came from Nashville.
Tennessee.

217
00:11:26.773 --> 00:11:30.864
I've heard Vic and Les be
referred to as a package deal.

218
00:11:30.907 --> 00:11:34.041
- Mr. Ireland did not recruit
Les Hunter.

219
00:11:34.084 --> 00:11:36.434
he recruited Vic Rouse.

220
00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:40.395
Vic Rouse said to him.
"If I come to your school.

221
00:11:40.438 --> 00:11:42.223
can Les come with us?"

222
00:11:42.266 --> 00:11:43.746
He said. "Of course."

223
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.488
He didn't realize he had a
diamond.

224
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:47.968
- [Jack] Les Hunter may have
been

225
00:11:48.011 --> 00:11:50.666
the most talented player on the
team.

226
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.624
- [Jerald] Vic and Les were the
bigs.

227
00:11:52.668 --> 00:11:56.150
They brought that
menacing athletic height.

228
00:11:56.193 --> 00:11:58.587
[upbeat music]

229
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.632
Ronnie Miller came from New
York.

230
00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:03.548
a very similar area that
my father came from.

231
00:12:03.592 --> 00:12:05.855
- When coach met my mother the
first time.

232
00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:07.770
he completely ignored me.

233
00:12:07.814 --> 00:12:10.033
He promised that any kid
that went to his school

234
00:12:10.077 --> 00:12:11.992
for four years would graduate.

235
00:12:12.035 --> 00:12:14.995
- George Ireland gave his
sales pitch to the parents.

236
00:12:15.038 --> 00:12:16.344
not to the kid.

237
00:12:16.387 --> 00:12:18.259
The kid's looking to
play big time basketball.

238
00:12:18.302 --> 00:12:21.479
he probably wasn't gonna
go to Loyola University.

239
00:12:21.523 --> 00:12:23.351
- [Ron] I was probably
the best defensive player

240
00:12:23.394 --> 00:12:25.179
on the team. so I could guard
someone

241
00:12:25.222 --> 00:12:27.747
that was bigger than me.

242
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:34.231
- [Rich] You had a group of
extremely talented freshmen.

243
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:36.103
- [Jack] I had never played

244
00:12:36.146 --> 00:12:39.889
with such talented
players before in my life.

245
00:12:39.933 --> 00:12:42.762
- [Rich] I knew we had something
special.

246
00:12:45.373 --> 00:12:48.115
- We lost one game as freshmen.

247
00:12:48.158 --> 00:12:51.683
And the word kinda spread
throughout college basketball

248
00:12:51.727 --> 00:12:54.077
that Loyola had this
excellent freshmen class.

249
00:12:57.864 --> 00:12:59.604
Well. we move up to the varsity.

250
00:13:00.518 --> 00:13:03.043
the reality of big-time
basketball

251
00:13:03.086 --> 00:13:05.306
kinda hit me in the
face for the first time.

252
00:13:06.742 --> 00:13:08.831
- [Gary] There was an unwritten
rule

253
00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:11.181
that racialized who played.

254
00:13:12.704 --> 00:13:15.838
- How many black players can be
played

255
00:13:15.882 --> 00:13:17.797
on the court at one time?

256
00:13:18.885 --> 00:13:22.105
One at home. two when you're
away.

257
00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:23.759
and three when you're in a
pinch.

258
00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:26.153
you need that little extra
oomph.

259
00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:28.851
And it's not written anywhere.

260
00:13:28.895 --> 00:13:31.680
It's just kind of what the
coaches knew.

261
00:13:31.723 --> 00:13:33.290
- [Michael] The coaches. if they
didn't

262
00:13:33.334 --> 00:13:35.292
wanna put black players on the
floor.

263
00:13:35.336 --> 00:13:38.687
they wouldn't have recruited
them to begin with.

264
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:43.735
But American higher education
was overwhelmingly segregated.

265
00:13:45.346 --> 00:13:48.436
Your student body is 98% white.

266
00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:51.526
the faculty is 99% white.

267
00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:55.095
the alumni are 99 1/2% white.

268
00:13:55.138 --> 00:13:58.011
How many black guys can
you put on the floor

269
00:13:58.054 --> 00:14:01.014
to represent this lily white
institution

270
00:14:01.057 --> 00:14:04.974
before you're gonna run into
blowback?

271
00:14:05.018 --> 00:14:06.889
How far could they go?

272
00:14:06.933 --> 00:14:09.022
- I value my job. I value my
reputation.

273
00:14:09.065 --> 00:14:12.112
so I'm not going to push the
system.

274
00:14:12.155 --> 00:14:13.461
I wonder how many coaches

275
00:14:13.504 --> 00:14:16.159
were just simply complying
with the status quo.

276
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.814
- [Lucas] Coach Ireland was
careful.

277
00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:21.121
He'd bend the rule. but never
break it.

278
00:14:22.252 --> 00:14:25.473
He consistently played three
black starters at a time.

279
00:14:25.516 --> 00:14:29.085
but fearing the reaction of
fans and university donors.

280
00:14:29.129 --> 00:14:30.521
he never played a fourth.

281
00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.917
- [Ron] How George Ireland
played us was when Jerry

282
00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:37.180
or Les Hunter would be in foul
trouble.

283
00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:39.487
or needed a break. I would
go in for one of them.

284
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.012
So I played. but I was
not allowed to start.

285
00:14:43.056 --> 00:14:45.449
And he'd follow that the whole
year.

286
00:14:45.493 --> 00:14:46.711
- These athletes were
marginalized

287
00:14:46.755 --> 00:14:47.974
and they didn't have the same
privileges

288
00:14:48.017 --> 00:14:49.845
as their white teammates did.

289
00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.325
And it was openly practiced.

290
00:14:51.368 --> 00:14:54.502
It was openly practiced.
and we didn't have any laws

291
00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:57.331
to protect individuals
from this kind of behavior.

292
00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:01.726
In the North. Jim Crow
segregation was practiced.

293
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.513
it was an unspoken rule. but not
the law.

294
00:15:05.556 --> 00:15:07.776
But Jim Crow was the law in the
South.

295
00:15:09.517 --> 00:15:13.521
- My absolute and unshakeable
stance

296
00:15:13.564 --> 00:15:16.828
for segregation of the
races at all levels.

297
00:15:16.872 --> 00:15:19.919
[audience clapping]

298
00:15:19.962 --> 00:15:22.704
- [Michael] Ross Barnett was
the governor of Mississippi

299
00:15:22.747 --> 00:15:25.881
at the time. rabid
segregationist.

300
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.361
- You gotta understand.
Mississippi

301
00:15:27.404 --> 00:15:29.319
was incredibly racially
volatile.

302
00:15:30.407 --> 00:15:32.540
If you even suggested something

303
00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:36.631
that included integration.
it could be life-threatening.

304
00:15:36.674 --> 00:15:37.980
It was that bad.

305
00:15:39.025 --> 00:15:40.852
- [Lucas] In his fight
to preserve segregation

306
00:15:40.896 --> 00:15:43.377
in the early 1960s. Governor
Barnett

307
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.814
made a special target out of
state sports.

308
00:15:45.857 --> 00:15:49.949
denouncing any competition
between white and black
athletes.

309
00:15:49.992 --> 00:15:51.907
One team falling under his rule

310
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.865
were the Mississippi State
Bulldogs.

311
00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:55.650
led by Coach Babe McCarthy.

312
00:15:56.564 --> 00:15:58.653
For three of the previous four
seasons.

313
00:15:58.696 --> 00:16:01.351
Mississippi State won
the SEC Championship.

314
00:16:01.395 --> 00:16:03.614
earning a spot in the NCAA
tournament.

315
00:16:04.528 --> 00:16:07.009
And each time. Coach
McCarthy did as he was told

316
00:16:07.053 --> 00:16:09.316
by the Governor and turned it
down.

317
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.884
- We grew up doing what
we were told to do.

318
00:16:12.928 --> 00:16:15.017
To not be able to go to the
tournament.

319
00:16:15.061 --> 00:16:18.586
the attitude of some of the
guys was. why do we even play?

320
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:20.457
We only wanted to go for one
reason.

321
00:16:20.501 --> 00:16:23.721
and that was to compete and
be the best we could be.

322
00:16:23.765 --> 00:16:25.941
- When you think about
Mississippi.

323
00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:29.075
you have to remember that
the world was different.

324
00:16:29.118 --> 00:16:30.990
The country was different.

325
00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:35.429
And we had to deal with
things differently.

326
00:16:35.472 --> 00:16:40.521
Racism in sports was not a new
thing.

327
00:16:40.564 --> 00:16:44.481
it was a part of the life that
we lived.

328
00:16:46.657 --> 00:16:49.660
- In 2001. I was a grad student
at Loyola

329
00:16:49.704 --> 00:16:53.882
as a oral historian. and I
started talking to the players.

330
00:16:53.925 --> 00:16:56.711
and I started hearing
about their experiences.

331
00:16:56.754 --> 00:16:58.713
And I tied that into the context

332
00:16:58.756 --> 00:17:00.410
of what was happening in
Chicago.

333
00:17:00.454 --> 00:17:02.673
because Chicago was then and is
now.

334
00:17:02.717 --> 00:17:04.675
quite a segregated city.

335
00:17:04.719 --> 00:17:06.460
What was it like for these guys?

336
00:17:08.505 --> 00:17:11.508
- One of the most surprising
things that I have found out.

337
00:17:11.552 --> 00:17:14.816
is things that were going on
in the minds of my teammates

338
00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:18.515
that I did not know was
going on in their mind then.

339
00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:21.388
In particular. someone
who I'm very close to.

340
00:17:21.431 --> 00:17:22.563
Jerry Harkness.

341
00:17:23.868 --> 00:17:28.047
When I first met him.
he was very standoffish.

342
00:17:29.352 --> 00:17:33.313
For more than a year.
we had no relationship

343
00:17:33.356 --> 00:17:35.880
other than on the basketball
court.

344
00:17:35.924 --> 00:17:39.101
If he was in the locker room.
I wouldn't acknowledge him.

345
00:17:39.145 --> 00:17:42.191
- Jack Egan actually played
my mother's high school

346
00:17:42.235 --> 00:17:44.628
in basketball. which was a black
team.

347
00:17:44.672 --> 00:17:49.677
And the kids from St. Rita
treated my mom's school
terribly.

348
00:17:50.634 --> 00:17:53.942
- [Jerry] She told me
that St. Rita's was racist

349
00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:57.076
and they would throw garbage
cans at you.

350
00:17:57.119 --> 00:18:00.470
I just drew a conclusion on him
early on.

351
00:18:01.906 --> 00:18:05.127
- [Jack] I grew up in a
neighborhood that was all white.

352
00:18:05.171 --> 00:18:09.175
It was mostly Irish. Polish and
Italian.

353
00:18:09.218 --> 00:18:11.786
- Marquette Park was
known as the neighborhood

354
00:18:11.829 --> 00:18:16.617
that most vehemently resisted
the housing initiatives

355
00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:20.142
that Martin Luther King
came to Chicago to promote.

356
00:18:21.056 --> 00:18:23.276
It was a place where
blacks were not welcome.

357
00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:26.279
You could be chased down and
even beaten.

358
00:18:26.322 --> 00:18:28.455
- [Martin] I've been
in many demonstrations

359
00:18:28.498 --> 00:18:31.719
all across the South. but I can
say

360
00:18:31.762 --> 00:18:33.503
that I have never seen.

361
00:18:33.547 --> 00:18:35.201
even in Mississippi and Alabama.

362
00:18:35.244 --> 00:18:39.118
mobs as hostile and as
hate-filled

363
00:18:39.161 --> 00:18:40.815
as I'm seeing in Chicago.

364
00:18:42.469 --> 00:18:45.733
- When I would go home
from Loyola University

365
00:18:45.776 --> 00:18:48.562
to go back to my neighborhood
on the Southside.

366
00:18:48.605 --> 00:18:51.869
a lot of my friends had
the same kind of notion

367
00:18:51.913 --> 00:18:56.222
that the black players
on the team needed me

368
00:18:56.265 --> 00:18:59.529
because I was the brains of the
outfit.

369
00:18:59.573 --> 00:19:02.358
You know who is? Les Hunter.

370
00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:06.797
- There's always been
stereotypes about black athletes

371
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:11.454
that they are all athlete.
very little smarts.

372
00:19:11.498 --> 00:19:13.587
- African American players were
described

373
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:18.069
as tremendous athletes. you
know. a physical specimen.

374
00:19:18.113 --> 00:19:19.506
Whereas a lot of the white
players

375
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:23.336
were described as crafty. smart.

376
00:19:23.379 --> 00:19:26.077
You didn't have to be that aware
to know

377
00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:27.949
what they were trying to say.

378
00:19:27.992 --> 00:19:30.865
[solemn music]

379
00:19:30.908 --> 00:19:33.215
- [Lucas] Of all the players
at the center of this story.

380
00:19:33.259 --> 00:19:36.087
I never had the chance to
meet Les Hunter or Vic Rouse.

381
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.701
Vic died in 1999 and Les passed
away

382
00:19:40.744 --> 00:19:42.268
during the making of this film.

383
00:19:43.486 --> 00:19:47.751
In many ways. Les and Vic
embodied Loyola at their best.

384
00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:52.016
Les was the team's top player
and Vic was their top student.

385
00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.019
And when Les missed a shot.
Vic was there to tip it in.

386
00:19:55.977 --> 00:19:58.719
For me. team chemistry is
everything.

387
00:19:58.762 --> 00:20:00.764
but you have to earn that trust.

388
00:20:00.808 --> 00:20:04.333
That was true for Jack and
Jerry. but in Les and Vic.

389
00:20:04.377 --> 00:20:06.640
the Ramblers always had
an example to follow.

390
00:20:11.862 --> 00:20:15.170
- [Rich] The program had been
under fire.

391
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:20.219
I saw an opportunity to be
a part of the resurgence.

392
00:20:21.307 --> 00:20:23.918
You have Loyola that no one

393
00:20:23.961 --> 00:20:27.443
had ever paid attention to
before.

394
00:20:27.487 --> 00:20:30.881
If we're going to compete
nationally.

395
00:20:30.925 --> 00:20:34.668
what we have to do is get past
race.

396
00:20:36.452 --> 00:20:38.106
- We weren't ranked. we weren't
a team

397
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:39.673
that people were looking at.

398
00:20:39.716 --> 00:20:41.022
We were an independent school.

399
00:20:41.065 --> 00:20:44.982
so we weren't the preseason
pick for anything.

400
00:20:46.027 --> 00:20:48.725
- [Lucas] In the 1961. '62
season.

401
00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:52.251
Ireland no longer had to
rely on Jerry's speed alone.

402
00:20:52.294 --> 00:20:54.296
Now. his whole team could run.

403
00:20:55.428 --> 00:20:57.778
- [Ron] Almost immediately
we developed this style

404
00:20:57.821 --> 00:21:02.261
of a rebound. a pass and a
basket.

405
00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.004
- Get down and score before the
defense

406
00:21:07.048 --> 00:21:09.268
had a chance to set up.

407
00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:10.312
That's all it was.

408
00:21:10.356 --> 00:21:13.533
And that's run-and-gun
basketball.

409
00:21:13.576 --> 00:21:15.883
[bright music]

410
00:21:15.926 --> 00:21:20.148
- Ireland believed in playing
his starters a long time.

411
00:21:20.191 --> 00:21:23.586
- [Michael] In the '61. '62
season. the team consisted

412
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.763
of Egan. and a guy named
Mike Gavin. Jerry Harkness.

413
00:21:26.807 --> 00:21:28.504
Les Hunter and Vic Rouse.

414
00:21:29.418 --> 00:21:31.638
Ireland's coaching style with
that team

415
00:21:31.681 --> 00:21:35.206
was just standing aside
and letting them run.

416
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:39.428
His genius as a coach was to
just let them play their game.

417
00:21:39.472 --> 00:21:42.083
[upbeat music]

418
00:21:43.911 --> 00:21:46.348
- [Ron] In the pros they
call it a motion offense.

419
00:21:46.392 --> 00:21:48.219
where someone is always moving.

420
00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:50.961
If you didn't stay with us.

421
00:21:51.005 --> 00:21:52.528
we would score an easy basket.

422
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.895
- The Ramblers had some games in
the South

423
00:22:11.939 --> 00:22:16.770
and they ran into some of the
hard truths

424
00:22:16.813 --> 00:22:19.642
of US race relations.

425
00:22:19.686 --> 00:22:21.775
- [Ron] The famous trip to New
Orleans

426
00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:23.864
where George Ireland. at the
last minute.

427
00:22:23.907 --> 00:22:25.474
told us that we would not be
able

428
00:22:25.518 --> 00:22:27.694
to stay together as a team.

429
00:22:27.737 --> 00:22:31.698
- [Rich] The black ball
players stayed in Algiers

430
00:22:31.741 --> 00:22:35.441
in private homes. while the
white players

431
00:22:35.484 --> 00:22:39.314
stayed in New Orleans in hotels.

432
00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:41.838
- And he said he didn't know
about it

433
00:22:41.882 --> 00:22:43.187
until the last minute.

434
00:22:44.885 --> 00:22:46.234
And I never believed that.

435
00:22:47.104 --> 00:22:49.672
[somber music]

436
00:22:51.108 --> 00:22:54.024
We land in New Orleans and the
black guys.

437
00:22:54.068 --> 00:22:56.200
all of us jump into a cab.

438
00:22:56.244 --> 00:22:58.768
And Ireland gets in the cab with
us.

439
00:22:58.812 --> 00:23:01.423
And it was a black driver. and
he said.

440
00:23:01.467 --> 00:23:03.947
"Sir. you're gonna have
to get out of my cab.

441
00:23:03.991 --> 00:23:06.515
It's against the law for a white
person

442
00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:09.083
to drive in a cab with black
people."

443
00:23:09.126 --> 00:23:11.259
And Ireland said. "Well. I'll
pay the fine

444
00:23:11.302 --> 00:23:13.130
if you get stopped."

445
00:23:13.174 --> 00:23:15.655
Driver said. "You don't
understand.

446
00:23:15.698 --> 00:23:18.266
It's not the fine. I will go to
jail."

447
00:23:19.528 --> 00:23:23.445
That's how bad it was in 1962.

448
00:23:23.489 --> 00:23:26.361
- [Rich] When we played
Loyola of New Orleans.

449
00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:28.102
the shock hit us.

450
00:23:28.145 --> 00:23:32.062
They had a roped-off section for
coloreds.

451
00:23:32.106 --> 00:23:33.934
- [Ron] You couldn't talk
back. you couldn't fight back.

452
00:23:33.977 --> 00:23:36.458
there was nothing you could do
about it.

453
00:23:36.502 --> 00:23:39.243
- [Rich] But you could express
that anger

454
00:23:39.287 --> 00:23:44.205
by taking it out on the other
squad.

455
00:23:44.248 --> 00:23:46.816
[upbeat music]

456
00:23:54.258 --> 00:23:57.523
The court was an equalizer.

457
00:23:57.566 --> 00:24:01.135
- After the game. the black
players went off to Algiers.

458
00:24:01.178 --> 00:24:04.573
And I can honestly say. that was
by far

459
00:24:04.617 --> 00:24:07.228
the best trip that we had.

460
00:24:07.271 --> 00:24:09.535
We had no curfew. parties at
night.

461
00:24:09.578 --> 00:24:12.363
and the people in the
community were so proud of us.

462
00:24:12.407 --> 00:24:13.974
they treated us like kings.

463
00:24:14.888 --> 00:24:18.065
- [Rich] They sent us two
brand new Pontiacs to drive.

464
00:24:18.108 --> 00:24:22.504
We had a great time. and we felt
so sorry

465
00:24:22.548 --> 00:24:24.114
for the white guys.

466
00:24:24.158 --> 00:24:25.376
- [Ron] But in contrast.

467
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.031
what it took us to get to that
point.

468
00:24:28.075 --> 00:24:31.774
I felt offended by some of
the things that occurred.

469
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.084
- [Lucas] After the game.
Ireland made headlines

470
00:24:37.127 --> 00:24:39.434
denouncing New Orleans'
segregation laws.

471
00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:41.697
vowing that the team would never
return.

472
00:24:42.568 --> 00:24:45.745
But just a day later. the truth
came out.

473
00:24:45.788 --> 00:24:48.835
Prior to Loyola's trip.
another school in New Orleans.

474
00:24:48.878 --> 00:24:52.142
Xavier University. offered
to house the entire team.

475
00:24:53.404 --> 00:24:56.059
This rare break from the Jim
Crow laws governing the city

476
00:24:56.103 --> 00:24:58.627
would have allowed all the
white and black players

477
00:24:58.671 --> 00:25:00.194
to stay together as usual.

478
00:25:01.195 --> 00:25:03.458
But for reasons that
were never made clear.

479
00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:06.026
Ireland declined. and chose
instead

480
00:25:06.069 --> 00:25:07.549
to keep the team segregated.

481
00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:11.422
When I heard this story from the
players.

482
00:25:11.466 --> 00:25:12.554
I couldn't believe it.

483
00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.775
It's crazy to me that
any coach would choose

484
00:25:15.818 --> 00:25:18.734
to separate their team
anywhere for any reason.

485
00:25:19.648 --> 00:25:23.043
It's not just unsafe. it's bad
strategy.

486
00:25:23.086 --> 00:25:24.566
Your team is your family.

487
00:25:26.176 --> 00:25:30.180
- We had to deal not only with
the racism

488
00:25:30.224 --> 00:25:33.532
of the South when we
would travel down there.

489
00:25:33.575 --> 00:25:35.055
we also had to deal with it

490
00:25:35.098 --> 00:25:38.711
to some degree right
here at our home court.

491
00:25:38.754 --> 00:25:41.365
[solemn music]

492
00:25:42.715 --> 00:25:45.544
- [Jerald] When you think
about the Loyola story.

493
00:25:45.587 --> 00:25:50.549
you inevitably come to
a very complex topic.

494
00:25:53.987 --> 00:25:56.424
- We all kinda knew our place.

495
00:25:56.467 --> 00:25:58.339
It doesn't sound right when you
say that.

496
00:25:58.382 --> 00:26:00.646
it sounds terrible when you say
that.

497
00:26:00.689 --> 00:26:04.040
I just mean that as people. we
kinda knew

498
00:26:04.084 --> 00:26:06.129
what we had to do to survive.

499
00:26:07.174 --> 00:26:12.135
- They wanted us to be
available as tokens.

500
00:26:13.223 --> 00:26:16.400
For example. if they
had a party on campus.

501
00:26:16.444 --> 00:26:19.012
they wanted us to stand on the
walls.

502
00:26:19.055 --> 00:26:20.753
you know. and be there.

503
00:26:20.796 --> 00:26:23.190
But we weren't supposed
to dance with the girls.

504
00:26:23.233 --> 00:26:25.496
we weren't supposed to
talk with the girls.

505
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.239
And if they come to us
and ask us to dance.

506
00:26:29.283 --> 00:26:31.502
we even had Jesuit priests who
said.

507
00:26:31.546 --> 00:26:33.330
"No. you don't do that."

508
00:26:33.374 --> 00:26:35.724
[solemn music continues]

509
00:26:35.768 --> 00:26:39.075
- The priests had a job
and part of their job

510
00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:42.644
was making sure the students
were safe.

511
00:26:42.688 --> 00:26:46.430
And unfortunately the black male
body

512
00:26:46.474 --> 00:26:50.521
has often been considered.
just by existing. unsafe.

513
00:26:53.437 --> 00:26:54.917
- [Lucas] I guess I expected to
hear

514
00:26:54.961 --> 00:26:57.877
the '63 guys faced
discrimination
when traveling south.

515
00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.314
or maybe even on the court by
opponents.

516
00:27:00.357 --> 00:27:02.795
but to know that they were
also disrespected at home

517
00:27:02.838 --> 00:27:04.579
makes me furious.

518
00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:06.494
And on a call between our two
teams.

519
00:27:06.537 --> 00:27:08.670
we got an opportunity to talk
about it.

520
00:27:08.714 --> 00:27:12.152
- Then I remember. and the
other guys will remember this.

521
00:27:12.195 --> 00:27:15.677
we could not go to the barber
shop

522
00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:18.375
right across Sheridan Road.

523
00:27:18.419 --> 00:27:21.422
They would not cut black guys'
hair.

524
00:27:21.465 --> 00:27:23.293
- You couldn't get a haircut on
campus?

525
00:27:23.337 --> 00:27:26.383
Like. you had to go somewhere
else to get a haircut?

526
00:27:26.427 --> 00:27:29.952
- I guess again. I was blind
to what they were experiencing.

527
00:27:29.996 --> 00:27:32.346
Just assumed everything was
great.

528
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:37.090
- In the '60s. we didn't
express ourselves.

529
00:27:37.133 --> 00:27:40.093
'Cause I really don't think
we knew how to talk about it.

530
00:27:40.136 --> 00:27:42.835
- You know. the average person
might look at it and say.

531
00:27:42.878 --> 00:27:45.185
"That's not. that's not racism."

532
00:27:46.229 --> 00:27:47.056
But it is.

533
00:27:48.536 --> 00:27:50.843
- They're going to have to
swallow their discontent.

534
00:27:50.886 --> 00:27:52.671
They're going to have
to swallow their hurts.

535
00:27:52.714 --> 00:27:55.325
Because the moment they
start making waves.

536
00:27:55.369 --> 00:27:57.458
the moment they start asking for
things

537
00:27:57.501 --> 00:28:01.070
that they know they should
have. they're no longer

538
00:28:01.114 --> 00:28:03.943
just these wonderfully
respectable young men

539
00:28:03.986 --> 00:28:07.033
that we would be so
happy to have amongst us.

540
00:28:07.076 --> 00:28:09.992
There was a mold that they
needed to fit.

541
00:28:10.036 --> 00:28:12.734
Not the angry team. not the
frustrated.

542
00:28:12.778 --> 00:28:16.912
they were classy. and oh
look. how acceptable they are.

543
00:28:18.522 --> 00:28:22.396
That might be why they're not
loud and they're not vocal.

544
00:28:24.354 --> 00:28:27.967
- It makes you feel completely
isolated.

545
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:32.667
It is a very hard thing to face.

546
00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:35.670
What you say is nothing.
what you think is nothing.

547
00:28:36.932 --> 00:28:40.631
That's what it feels like
to be discriminated against.

548
00:28:40.675 --> 00:28:43.722
You're invisible. you don't
exist.

549
00:28:45.854 --> 00:28:46.986
You don't exist.

550
00:28:51.599 --> 00:28:53.209
- Toward the end of the season.

551
00:28:53.253 --> 00:28:54.776
Ron Miller began playing

552
00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.996
a more prominent role on the
team.

553
00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:59.520
He was scoring a lot. and at one
point.

554
00:28:59.563 --> 00:29:01.827
Ireland pulled him aside to tell
him

555
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:03.393
why he wasn't starting.

556
00:29:03.437 --> 00:29:05.439
And he didn't really tell him.
he said.

557
00:29:05.482 --> 00:29:08.268
"But you know. you understand
what it is."

558
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:09.922
And Miller did understand.

559
00:29:10.836 --> 00:29:14.448
Ireland didn't wanna have the
fourth black guy on the court.

560
00:29:14.491 --> 00:29:17.016
- It was so obvious to
everyone around the team

561
00:29:17.059 --> 00:29:18.582
and everyone at Loyola.

562
00:29:18.626 --> 00:29:22.543
that we should have had
four blacks starting.

563
00:29:22.586 --> 00:29:24.980
You keep in mind. I'm coming off
the bench

564
00:29:25.024 --> 00:29:26.895
and I was averaging double
figures.

565
00:29:26.939 --> 00:29:31.813
So that tells you that maybe.
I should have been starting.

566
00:29:31.857 --> 00:29:33.946
- [Rich] The one white
boy that he was starting

567
00:29:33.989 --> 00:29:38.602
over Ron Miller had no business
starting.

568
00:29:38.646 --> 00:29:41.780
And he knew it and every boy
knew it.

569
00:29:42.955 --> 00:29:46.175
- [Lucas] In 1962. Loyola went
21 and 3.

570
00:29:46.219 --> 00:29:48.656
earning a bid to the National
Invitation Tournament

571
00:29:48.699 --> 00:29:50.658
at Madison Square Garden in New
York.

572
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.053
With two Harlem natives on his
team.

573
00:29:54.096 --> 00:29:55.489
Ireland saw an opportunity

574
00:29:55.532 --> 00:29:58.709
to lure the next generation
of local recruits.

575
00:29:58.753 --> 00:30:01.800
- We had advanced to the
semis playing Dayton.

576
00:30:02.713 --> 00:30:04.846
And what really surprised me

577
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.632
was that Coach Ireland changed
the lineup.

578
00:30:10.025 --> 00:30:11.505
- [Ron] He wanted to start me

579
00:30:11.548 --> 00:30:14.856
because he was recruiting
heavy out of New York City.

580
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.336
Local papers made a big deal

581
00:30:16.379 --> 00:30:18.904
that I was coming back
to Madison Square Garden.

582
00:30:18.947 --> 00:30:22.516
Two New York kids. me and Jerry
Harkness.

583
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:24.431
- So he has to play Miller

584
00:30:24.474 --> 00:30:28.130
and he has to play me
because we're in New York.

585
00:30:28.174 --> 00:30:33.266
So he takes out 6-8. 6-9 Hunter.

586
00:30:33.309 --> 00:30:35.703
- [Michael] He brought
Miller in for Les Hunter.

587
00:30:35.746 --> 00:30:37.879
Best ball player on the team.

588
00:30:37.923 --> 00:30:40.012
- [John] Dayton was a hell of a
team.

589
00:30:40.055 --> 00:30:42.231
And we were getting beat up
pretty bad.

590
00:30:43.145 --> 00:30:47.323
- Take out Les Hunter and
we're smaller. much smaller.

591
00:30:47.367 --> 00:30:50.152
It just put us in a bad
situation.

592
00:30:51.806 --> 00:30:53.764
- [Lucas] Ron Miller was
the Ramblers' high scorer

593
00:30:53.808 --> 00:30:56.942
in the game. but without
Hunter in the lineup.

594
00:30:56.985 --> 00:30:59.292
Loyola was just outmatched.

595
00:30:59.335 --> 00:31:01.729
- [Ron] So we lost to them.

596
00:31:01.772 --> 00:31:04.210
We had to play another game
after that.

597
00:31:04.253 --> 00:31:06.081
which was a consolation game.

598
00:31:06.125 --> 00:31:07.909
And we played Duquesne
University.

599
00:31:07.953 --> 00:31:11.608
which was a very good
basketball school in those days.

600
00:31:11.652 --> 00:31:12.871
- [Rich] And you have to
remember

601
00:31:12.914 --> 00:31:15.917
that Mr. Ireland was in
difficulty.

602
00:31:16.962 --> 00:31:19.573
He could not afford to lose.

603
00:31:20.661 --> 00:31:23.882
- Ireland was not trying
to be an activist.

604
00:31:23.925 --> 00:31:26.928
George Ireland was thinking
about winning ball games.

605
00:31:26.972 --> 00:31:30.410
- And that was the game
where Ireland chose

606
00:31:30.453 --> 00:31:33.326
not to play the senior. Mike
Gavin.

607
00:31:33.369 --> 00:31:37.025
and inserted Ron Miller
as the other guard.

608
00:31:38.984 --> 00:31:41.334
- [Jerry] He put the
best team on the court.

609
00:31:43.423 --> 00:31:45.729
- [Gary] He broke the code.

610
00:31:45.773 --> 00:31:47.993
[dramatic music]

611
00:31:48.036 --> 00:31:52.823
- When we won the consolation
game. from there on.

612
00:31:52.867 --> 00:31:54.695
he played four black guys.

613
00:31:56.305 --> 00:31:59.526
- [Lucas] On that historic
night. the Iron Five were born.

614
00:32:00.788 --> 00:32:02.877
For the Loyola Ramblers.

615
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:05.140
there would be no turning back.

616
00:32:05.184 --> 00:32:06.185
- [Interviewer] Let me ask you
this.

617
00:32:06.228 --> 00:32:08.622
do you ever get crank phone
calls?

618
00:32:08.665 --> 00:32:13.627
- [Gertrude] Well. they
criticize
who he's got on his team.

619
00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.586
As you know he has a Negro ball
club.

620
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:19.763
And we get letters on that.

621
00:32:19.807 --> 00:32:20.939
- [Interviewer] Well. that's
terrible.

622
00:32:20.982 --> 00:32:23.332
The rest of the world could take
a cue

623
00:32:23.376 --> 00:32:25.726
from on integration is how
well these kids get along

624
00:32:25.769 --> 00:32:26.988
together on the basketball
court.

625
00:32:27.032 --> 00:32:28.250
- [Gertrude] That's right.

626
00:32:29.556 --> 00:32:31.123
- [Lucas] With his new starting
five set

627
00:32:31.166 --> 00:32:34.822
for the 1962. '63 season.
there was plenty of fallout

628
00:32:34.865 --> 00:32:36.867
for George Ireland and his
family.

629
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:38.913
But with his eyes on a national
title.

630
00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:41.002
the coach had come too far to
turn back.

631
00:32:42.221 --> 00:32:45.311
Meanwhile. there was
another team down south

632
00:32:45.354 --> 00:32:46.790
with their eyes on the title.

633
00:32:48.444 --> 00:32:51.230
- I was always fascinated
about the psychology

634
00:32:51.273 --> 00:32:53.841
of the Mississippi State
basketball team.

635
00:32:53.884 --> 00:32:55.451
You're feeling a lot of pressure

636
00:32:55.495 --> 00:32:58.454
if your programs aren't
performing well. if you're
losing.

637
00:32:58.498 --> 00:33:01.109
The irony is that Mississippi
State was winning.

638
00:33:01.153 --> 00:33:04.547
And the more they won. the
more pressure they faced.

639
00:33:04.591 --> 00:33:06.985
- Our governor in
particular just didn't think

640
00:33:07.028 --> 00:33:09.509
we ought to be playing
against black players.

641
00:33:09.552 --> 00:33:12.120
We never imagined that we would
get to go

642
00:33:12.164 --> 00:33:15.080
to the NCAA tournament in '63.

643
00:33:15.123 --> 00:33:16.995
- Young people are often a
product

644
00:33:17.038 --> 00:33:20.781
of a dysfunctional
situation. taught things

645
00:33:20.824 --> 00:33:22.652
that they shouldn't be taught.

646
00:33:22.696 --> 00:33:25.873
And it's not until they
actually experience

647
00:33:25.916 --> 00:33:28.441
a different set of circumstances

648
00:33:28.484 --> 00:33:31.313
that they can appreciate what
should be.

649
00:33:32.358 --> 00:33:34.925
- [Lucas] In Mississippi. if
you opposed Governor Barnett

650
00:33:34.969 --> 00:33:36.971
and the racism of Jim Crow laws.

651
00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:39.974
you were all but guaranteed
a prison sentence.

652
00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:41.280
Or maybe even worse.

653
00:33:41.323 --> 00:33:43.282
with the state's long
history of lynchings.

654
00:33:45.806 --> 00:33:48.069
But despite those very real
threats.

655
00:33:48.113 --> 00:33:51.072
just 100 miles from the
Mississippi State campus.

656
00:33:51.116 --> 00:33:54.641
there was someone still
brave enough to fight back.

657
00:33:54.684 --> 00:33:56.295
- [Reporter] The enrollment
of James Meredith.

658
00:33:56.338 --> 00:33:58.253
the first African American to
attend

659
00:33:58.297 --> 00:34:00.951
on the campus of Ole Miss.

660
00:34:00.995 --> 00:34:04.303
That night a riot broke
out. hundreds were injured.

661
00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:05.521
Two people died

662
00:34:05.565 --> 00:34:08.176
as protesters tried to stop a
black man

663
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.353
from attending a
tax-supported state school.

664
00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.922
- James Meredith. who
was a Mississippi native

665
00:34:14.965 --> 00:34:17.533
and a veteran. applied to enter

666
00:34:17.577 --> 00:34:19.970
the University of Mississippi.
Ole Miss.

667
00:34:20.014 --> 00:34:21.494
Ross Barnett said

668
00:34:21.537 --> 00:34:25.541
that Meredith would enter
Ole Miss over his dead body.

669
00:34:25.585 --> 00:34:29.502
- His admission caused a
riot of such magnitude.

670
00:34:29.545 --> 00:34:32.505
the president called out
National Guard troops

671
00:34:32.548 --> 00:34:34.246
to come put the riot down.

672
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.118
- [Reporter] Immediately
following the mass panic.

673
00:34:37.162 --> 00:34:39.425
the college infirmary was
besieged

674
00:34:39.468 --> 00:34:43.081
with injured persons.
officers and students.

675
00:34:43.124 --> 00:34:44.560
- People died.

676
00:34:44.604 --> 00:34:46.693
It's hard to believe that ever
happened.

677
00:34:46.736 --> 00:34:48.999
but it damn sure did.

678
00:34:50.523 --> 00:34:52.612
- [Lucas] As the dust
settled after the riots.

679
00:34:52.655 --> 00:34:55.832
James Meredith successfully
enrolled at Ole Miss.

680
00:34:55.876 --> 00:34:57.660
Another small piece of progress

681
00:34:57.704 --> 00:34:59.445
in the Civil Rights Movement.

682
00:34:59.488 --> 00:35:01.621
And while figures like
Babe McCarthy were left

683
00:35:01.664 --> 00:35:04.189
to grapple with what
it meant on his campus.

684
00:35:04.232 --> 00:35:07.409
back in Chicago. they were
listening too.

685
00:35:07.453 --> 00:35:09.063
- [Rich] Things were starting to
change.

686
00:35:09.107 --> 00:35:10.934
but not rapidly enough.

687
00:35:12.458 --> 00:35:17.245
We would sit up in my
room around this radio.

688
00:35:17.289 --> 00:35:20.770
listening and cheering for
people

689
00:35:20.814 --> 00:35:24.122
who were doing things
to make a difference.

690
00:35:24.165 --> 00:35:25.340
- We were in the middle

691
00:35:25.384 --> 00:35:28.300
of the Civil Rights Movement and
Dr. King.

692
00:35:28.343 --> 00:35:30.911
The emphasis was put on them.

693
00:35:30.954 --> 00:35:34.828
but we in the background
were making changes too.

694
00:35:34.871 --> 00:35:36.221
[upbeat music]

695
00:35:36.264 --> 00:35:38.658
- We really started the season
with.

696
00:35:38.701 --> 00:35:40.529
not just a good team. but a
great team.

697
00:35:40.573 --> 00:35:44.751
We had seven guys who
legitimately could start.

698
00:35:44.794 --> 00:35:46.144
- They were the highest scoring
team

699
00:35:46.187 --> 00:35:47.362
in the country that year.

700
00:35:47.406 --> 00:35:49.190
They knew exactly what the next
step

701
00:35:49.234 --> 00:35:51.410
of the other was going to be.

702
00:35:51.453 --> 00:35:54.239
- There was something
electric that happened to us.

703
00:35:54.282 --> 00:35:58.591
We just knew that we were
going to be very good.

704
00:35:58.634 --> 00:36:00.506
- [Jerald] They were bulldozing
teams.

705
00:36:00.549 --> 00:36:02.203
No one could stop them.

706
00:36:02.247 --> 00:36:05.511
- In retaliation to
all of this resistance.

707
00:36:05.554 --> 00:36:07.121
they ran up the scores.

708
00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:11.343
Send a message. "We're good
and we're good at what we do."

709
00:36:11.386 --> 00:36:12.822
- [Mike] Is this the best team
you've had

710
00:36:12.866 --> 00:36:15.216
in your 12 years as Loyola
coach?

711
00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.914
- [George] Well. Mike. I
think this is my best team.

712
00:36:17.958 --> 00:36:19.177
- [Mike] Well. there's
no question about it.

713
00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.004
you certainly do have an
excellent team.

714
00:36:21.048 --> 00:36:23.790
In fact. you must be ranked
second in the nation.

715
00:36:23.833 --> 00:36:25.357
George Ireland. how do you think

716
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.229
that your Loyola club would
make out against Cincinnati?

717
00:36:28.273 --> 00:36:29.970
- [George] Well. that's a hard
question.

718
00:36:30.013 --> 00:36:33.321
We are an offensive team and
Cincinnati

719
00:36:33.365 --> 00:36:34.888
are a defensive team.

720
00:36:34.931 --> 00:36:36.629
I would like to play Cincinnati

721
00:36:36.672 --> 00:36:38.892
and possibly sometime we will.

722
00:36:38.935 --> 00:36:41.634
- For such a long period of time
we knew

723
00:36:41.677 --> 00:36:44.376
that. somewhere along
the way. we were going

724
00:36:44.419 --> 00:36:47.944
to go up against Cincinnati.

725
00:36:47.988 --> 00:36:51.861
They were the big dogs.
we were the underdogs.

726
00:36:51.905 --> 00:36:54.908
- Cincinnati had become a
machine. a real machine.

727
00:36:54.951 --> 00:36:57.040
under the leadership of Ed
Jucker.

728
00:36:57.084 --> 00:37:00.000
[gentle jaunty music]

729
00:37:00.043 --> 00:37:02.568
- Cincinnati was the
complete opposite of Loyola.

730
00:37:02.611 --> 00:37:05.310
Cincinnati had won two
championships

731
00:37:05.353 --> 00:37:08.791
with a very deliberate.
slow-down pace.

732
00:37:08.835 --> 00:37:10.315
When you talk about a team

733
00:37:10.358 --> 00:37:12.926
that wanted to make four
passes before they took a shot.

734
00:37:12.969 --> 00:37:16.059
Cincinnati probably
wanted to make six passes.

735
00:37:16.103 --> 00:37:18.453
Something that was not in our
DNA at all.

736
00:37:19.367 --> 00:37:20.977
- [Lucas] While Loyola
was the fastest team

737
00:37:21.021 --> 00:37:23.284
in college basketball. no one
matched

738
00:37:23.328 --> 00:37:26.244
the slow. tactical pace of
Cincinnati.

739
00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:30.639
At a time when more and
more teams experimented

740
00:37:30.683 --> 00:37:33.686
with running the ball.
Ed Jucker found success

741
00:37:33.729 --> 00:37:35.340
by doing just the opposite.

742
00:37:35.383 --> 00:37:37.429
- [David] Don't shoot
unless you have a good shot.

743
00:37:37.472 --> 00:37:39.344
Hold the ball if you
need to once in a while.

744
00:37:39.387 --> 00:37:41.563
that was before the days of shot
clock.

745
00:37:41.607 --> 00:37:43.086
- [Michael] Everyone thought he
was crazy

746
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.568
until he won his first NCAA
Championship.

747
00:37:46.612 --> 00:37:49.963
They thought he was lucky
until he won his second.

748
00:37:50.006 --> 00:37:53.183
[gentle upbeat music]

749
00:37:54.881 --> 00:37:57.840
- When they got ahead of you by
10 points.

750
00:37:57.884 --> 00:37:59.973
you were probably toast.

751
00:38:00.016 --> 00:38:02.280
- [Lucas] Combined with
the talents of Tom Thacker.

752
00:38:02.323 --> 00:38:04.673
Ron Bonham and George Wilson.

753
00:38:04.717 --> 00:38:07.328
Cincinnati was set to
be the first-ever team

754
00:38:07.372 --> 00:38:09.461
to win three consecutive titles.

755
00:38:09.504 --> 00:38:10.810
- We had the best record.

756
00:38:10.853 --> 00:38:12.202
I don't know what Loyola was.

757
00:38:12.246 --> 00:38:14.683
but they didn't win as
many games as we did.

758
00:38:14.727 --> 00:38:17.033
- [Ron] I mean. Cincinnati
was the monster.

759
00:38:17.077 --> 00:38:18.557
Why would you think that this
small.

760
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.776
Catholic school could beat
Cincinnati?

761
00:38:24.737 --> 00:38:27.043
- [Lucas] Out of everything
I learned about this story.

762
00:38:27.087 --> 00:38:29.132
I was most surprised by
Cincinnati.

763
00:38:30.264 --> 00:38:32.353
Because for all the
praise given to Ireland

764
00:38:32.397 --> 00:38:34.355
for breaking that unwritten
rule.

765
00:38:34.399 --> 00:38:37.053
I didn't know that Ed
Jucker broke it first.

766
00:38:37.097 --> 00:38:39.795
months before Ireland. winning
a national championship

767
00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:42.581
with four black starters in
1962.

768
00:38:42.624 --> 00:38:45.235
[gentle music]

769
00:38:47.977 --> 00:38:50.110
You might say it was easier for
Cincinnati

770
00:38:50.153 --> 00:38:52.634
since they were already
defending national champs.

771
00:38:53.896 --> 00:38:56.725
But I think it's more likely
that four black starters

772
00:38:56.769 --> 00:39:00.076
with a slow. controlled
game were less threatening

773
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.644
than Loyola's aggressive.
fast-break players.

774
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.561
Whatever the explanation is.

775
00:39:06.605 --> 00:39:08.694
these two trailblazing teams
seemed to be

776
00:39:08.737 --> 00:39:11.653
on a clear path to the
championship.

777
00:39:13.307 --> 00:39:15.135
But the season was far from
over.

778
00:39:15.178 --> 00:39:17.659
and Loyola's future
was suddenly uncertain.

779
00:39:21.663 --> 00:39:22.882
- [Michael] Midway through the
season.

780
00:39:22.925 --> 00:39:25.972
Loyola lost three players.

781
00:39:26.015 --> 00:39:29.062
One of them left for financial
reasons.

782
00:39:29.105 --> 00:39:31.978
The other two were New
York playground guys.

783
00:39:32.021 --> 00:39:34.981
They didn't make grades.
and would have gotten

784
00:39:35.024 --> 00:39:38.724
a lot of playing time had
they stayed on the team.

785
00:39:39.942 --> 00:39:42.162
- Everyone was understandably
shocked

786
00:39:42.205 --> 00:39:43.772
when all that happened at once.

787
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.210
We had nine players. that was
it.

788
00:39:47.254 --> 00:39:51.084
It was so awkward just to have
scrimmages

789
00:39:51.127 --> 00:39:53.216
and you have nine people.

790
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.436
- [Michael] Their absence
is one of the reasons

791
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.440
that the five starters were
playing virtually every minute.

792
00:40:00.615 --> 00:40:03.401
- [Lucas] The Iron Five were
used to playing nonstop.

793
00:40:03.444 --> 00:40:06.360
But now. even when Loyola took
big leads.

794
00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:09.189
Ireland refused to give
any of them a break.

795
00:40:09.232 --> 00:40:10.843
- Some of the games
were complete blowouts.

796
00:40:10.886 --> 00:40:12.627
We would still be playing. I
mean.

797
00:40:12.671 --> 00:40:16.152
we'd be up by 15. 20 points.

798
00:40:16.196 --> 00:40:18.459
and he would still have
all of us in the game.

799
00:40:18.503 --> 00:40:20.635
- We had a 30-point lead at
halftime.

800
00:40:22.028 --> 00:40:24.422
Man. I'm gonna be playing.

801
00:40:24.465 --> 00:40:26.162
[blows raspberry] Never got in.

802
00:40:26.206 --> 00:40:28.861
[solemn music]

803
00:40:28.904 --> 00:40:31.690
- That starting five.
I think he was nervous

804
00:40:31.733 --> 00:40:34.954
when any one of them was off of
the floor.

805
00:40:34.997 --> 00:40:39.567
And it wasn't that we were
incapable of contributing.

806
00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:42.788
People don't realize how good we
were

807
00:40:42.831 --> 00:40:44.833
because they never saw us.

808
00:40:44.877 --> 00:40:49.838
We'd be up 35. 40 points. let's
give the first team a break.

809
00:40:51.013 --> 00:40:54.408
- I was feeling badly because
we had guys on the bench

810
00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:56.192
that weren't getting in.

811
00:40:56.236 --> 00:40:58.891
I said. "Coach. take me out. I'm
tired."

812
00:40:58.934 --> 00:40:59.892
He said. "Stay in."

813
00:41:01.546 --> 00:41:04.157
- [Lucas] Trust me. I can tell
you.

814
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.900
being on the court 40
minutes straight is no joke.

815
00:41:07.943 --> 00:41:11.425
To play that fast-paced style
every game without a sub?

816
00:41:12.905 --> 00:41:14.428
That can break you.

817
00:41:17.562 --> 00:41:20.652
And that season. as the
exhaustion built on the court.

818
00:41:20.695 --> 00:41:22.436
the pressure got to everyone.

819
00:41:23.393 --> 00:41:25.744
- We were in New York playing
St. John's.

820
00:41:25.787 --> 00:41:28.398
Jerry Lyne came out and says.
"George is on the table.

821
00:41:28.442 --> 00:41:30.096
He's coughing up blood."

822
00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:31.837
You know. he had a bleeding
ulcer.

823
00:41:32.707 --> 00:41:33.969
- You know. there were times

824
00:41:34.013 --> 00:41:37.407
when guys out there on
that floor were hurting.

825
00:41:37.451 --> 00:41:39.018
They had been injured.

826
00:41:39.061 --> 00:41:41.847
Vic Rouse had had a shoulder
separation.

827
00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:43.805
and they would have to put it
back in

828
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:44.937
and tape it up.

829
00:41:46.068 --> 00:41:49.985
When you run a team for 30
games.

830
00:41:50.029 --> 00:41:51.813
you know. iron wears out.

831
00:41:53.206 --> 00:41:57.645
We tried to figure out why
certain things happened.

832
00:41:57.689 --> 00:42:00.039
Why certain things didn't
happen.

833
00:42:00.996 --> 00:42:03.346
But. we loved each other.

834
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.872
Five guys were going to play.

835
00:42:06.915 --> 00:42:09.483
and the other four

836
00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:11.877
were going to be supportive of
them.

837
00:42:14.227 --> 00:42:15.924
- [Lucas] Worn down. Loyola
suffered

838
00:42:15.968 --> 00:42:19.014
their only two defeats of the
season late in the schedule.

839
00:42:20.625 --> 00:42:23.149
The struggle for the
Iron Five was increasing.

840
00:42:24.193 --> 00:42:26.413
But the worst was yet to come.

841
00:42:28.197 --> 00:42:31.549
[gentle dramatic music]

842
00:42:37.816 --> 00:42:40.427
- [Jack] The game was in
Houston. Texas.

843
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:42.908
- To me. we were just going
down to play another team.

844
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:46.520
That's how naive and
ignorant I was back then.

845
00:42:47.913 --> 00:42:50.611
It was a pretty small. confined
gym.

846
00:42:50.655 --> 00:42:52.221
It didn't take long to realize

847
00:42:52.265 --> 00:42:54.746
that it was gonna be more
than a basketball game.

848
00:42:55.747 --> 00:42:59.402
- [Jerry] Things started to
unravel.

849
00:42:59.446 --> 00:43:02.884
- [Chuck] I believe everybody
in the stadium was against us.

850
00:43:02.928 --> 00:43:05.278
- The fans were out of control.

851
00:43:06.453 --> 00:43:08.847
- [Jerry] Go back home. get out
of here.

852
00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:10.457
We're gonna get you.

853
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.764
- They used the N-word
constantly.

854
00:43:12.807 --> 00:43:15.636
Threw ice. threw things
at us on the court.

855
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.726
- [Jack] The students throwing
stuff.

856
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.120
I mean. they look like me.

857
00:43:22.034 --> 00:43:25.951
Never having experienced
that side of racism.

858
00:43:25.994 --> 00:43:27.953
literally. they're spitting on
us.

859
00:43:27.996 --> 00:43:30.738
This is what you guys go
through on a daily basis?

860
00:43:32.044 --> 00:43:35.830
- I looked to the side.
I didn't see police.

861
00:43:35.874 --> 00:43:37.179
And I started to worry.

862
00:43:39.007 --> 00:43:41.401
- [Rich] There were times during
that game

863
00:43:41.444 --> 00:43:46.449
that we feared for our
lives. it was that bad.

864
00:43:47.712 --> 00:43:50.889
- All of the sudden. we heard a
loud bang.

865
00:43:50.932 --> 00:43:52.368
[object bangs]

866
00:43:52.412 --> 00:43:55.502
I swear to God. I thought
they were shooting at us.

867
00:43:55.545 --> 00:43:59.637
Somebody took a popcorn bag and
popped it.

868
00:44:00.768 --> 00:44:03.858
- That was one of the worst
experiences on the court

869
00:44:03.902 --> 00:44:06.078
that we experienced as a team.

870
00:44:06.121 --> 00:44:08.515
This is when we talk about
Coach George Ireland.

871
00:44:08.558 --> 00:44:09.951
To me. he should have known
that.

872
00:44:09.995 --> 00:44:12.693
he should not have put
us in those situations.

873
00:44:12.737 --> 00:44:16.479
If he cared. he would not have
put us in those situations.

874
00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:21.093
- Coach Ireland had a lot of
power.

875
00:44:21.136 --> 00:44:23.748
And I'm not just talking about
the power

876
00:44:23.791 --> 00:44:27.490
to play the starters the entire
game.

877
00:44:27.534 --> 00:44:31.233
He had the power to say.
"This is a segregated city.

878
00:44:31.277 --> 00:44:34.280
and things might be a
little scary for you.

879
00:44:34.323 --> 00:44:36.064
but you're gonna play anyway."

880
00:44:36.108 --> 00:44:39.720
And maybe they would have
chosen to play anyway.

881
00:44:39.764 --> 00:44:42.984
but we don't know that. because
they didn't have a choice.

882
00:44:44.333 --> 00:44:46.596
- [Lucas] Through all the
highs and lows of that season.

883
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.902
the game at Houston

884
00:44:47.946 --> 00:44:50.122
left the most lasting
impression on the team.

885
00:44:51.819 --> 00:44:54.474
But they won the game. and
for the first time ever

886
00:44:54.517 --> 00:44:57.869
Loyola accepted their invitation
to the NCAA tournament.

887
00:45:01.307 --> 00:45:02.830
The Iron Five were about to face

888
00:45:02.874 --> 00:45:05.398
a whole new level of public
scrutiny

889
00:45:05.441 --> 00:45:08.009
and there was nowhere to
hide from what was coming.

890
00:45:10.229 --> 00:45:12.927
[somber music]

891
00:45:12.971 --> 00:45:14.146
- We get the mail.

892
00:45:15.713 --> 00:45:17.671
On the outside it was KKK.

893
00:45:19.194 --> 00:45:24.156
"You don't belong on the
same floor as white players.

894
00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:26.941
We're gonna kill you."

895
00:45:26.985 --> 00:45:29.291
And I'ma tell you. I was scared
to death.

896
00:45:29.335 --> 00:45:31.032
They know where I live.

897
00:45:31.076 --> 00:45:33.382
They're gonna come to the dorm
and get me.

898
00:45:34.819 --> 00:45:36.516
I called Ireland. I said.

899
00:45:36.559 --> 00:45:38.779
"Ireland. you gotta get over
here."

900
00:45:38.823 --> 00:45:42.087
And he went to the front desk of
the dorm.

901
00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:47.135
"Any mail that comes in for the
ballplayers. give it to me."

902
00:45:48.223 --> 00:45:50.530
- My dad would keep the mail
from them.

903
00:45:50.573 --> 00:45:52.750
He did not want them to read

904
00:45:52.793 --> 00:45:55.535
some of the things that were
sent.

905
00:45:55.578 --> 00:45:57.145
Dad would show it to us at home.

906
00:45:57.189 --> 00:46:00.322
I just could not believe any
human beings

907
00:46:00.366 --> 00:46:04.718
would send stuff like this
to 19. 20-year-old kids.

908
00:46:05.719 --> 00:46:08.983
- I've heard stories of the
letters that he received.

909
00:46:09.027 --> 00:46:10.855
But I personally never
seen any of the letters.

910
00:46:10.898 --> 00:46:13.640
I believe that he did receive
letters.

911
00:46:13.683 --> 00:46:16.077
- I was never able to get to the
letters.

912
00:46:16.121 --> 00:46:18.732
In my mind. I had to put
the letters out of my book

913
00:46:18.776 --> 00:46:22.780
because I couldn't prove them.

914
00:46:24.346 --> 00:46:27.959
- There's three like this
that are all closed up.

915
00:46:29.134 --> 00:46:34.095
And up in the corner it says.
"Loyola HM." for hate mail.

916
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:36.750
The way they were signed.

917
00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:40.493
"Uncle Tom." and "KKK." the
N-word.

918
00:46:40.536 --> 00:46:42.974
He said he wanted me to have it

919
00:46:43.017 --> 00:46:45.237
because he knew I would protect
it.

920
00:46:46.716 --> 00:46:51.634
And he said. "Someday. this
history will be alive again.

921
00:46:52.592 --> 00:46:56.509
And maybe then you can show it."

922
00:46:56.552 --> 00:46:59.077
[somber music]

923
00:47:17.225 --> 00:47:19.532
He knew it was the wrong thing
to do.

924
00:47:19.575 --> 00:47:24.102
but he could not let this keep
coming to his ball players.

925
00:47:24.145 --> 00:47:26.234
I thought. "If I can just
protect them.

926
00:47:26.278 --> 00:47:29.020
who needs to know about this
stuff?"

927
00:47:29.063 --> 00:47:32.153
It happened. it's here and I
promised Dad

928
00:47:32.197 --> 00:47:33.633
that I would protect it.

929
00:47:35.983 --> 00:47:37.376
- [Lucas] It's tempting to hide

930
00:47:37.419 --> 00:47:41.902
the worst parts of our
histories. to lock them away.

931
00:47:41.946 --> 00:47:43.469
pretend they don't exist.

932
00:47:45.993 --> 00:47:48.213
Maybe for Ireland. these letters
were seen

933
00:47:48.256 --> 00:47:50.868
as a burden on the players. a
distraction

934
00:47:50.911 --> 00:47:52.391
at the height of their season.

935
00:47:54.306 --> 00:47:56.656
Maybe it was easiest
to just move past them.

936
00:47:58.092 --> 00:48:01.313
But the problem is. Ireland
didn't.

937
00:48:02.444 --> 00:48:04.882
Among those letters
were threats so severe.

938
00:48:04.925 --> 00:48:06.884
he hired security for his
daughters.

939
00:48:07.797 --> 00:48:10.191
a protection he never offered
his players.

940
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.370
- [Ron] I don't think he thought
at all

941
00:48:15.414 --> 00:48:17.459
about race relations.

942
00:48:17.503 --> 00:48:21.942
I don't think he was
interested in race relations.

943
00:48:21.986 --> 00:48:25.337
I think George Ireland was
thinking about himself.

944
00:48:26.425 --> 00:48:30.037
his family. and winning
basketball games.

945
00:48:31.212 --> 00:48:36.043
I always accepted that
as a part of the times.

946
00:48:36.087 --> 00:48:38.698
I never held that part against
him.

947
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:42.397
It was important to him
that he was successful.

948
00:48:42.441 --> 00:48:47.141
And by being good to us.
it made him successful.

949
00:48:49.448 --> 00:48:51.232
- [Lucas] Even through the death
threats.

950
00:48:51.276 --> 00:48:53.931
the Loyola players found
a way to stay focused.

951
00:48:56.585 --> 00:48:59.197
The NCAA tournament was fast
approaching

952
00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.721
and Cincinnati was still
expected to win it all.

953
00:49:05.464 --> 00:49:06.682
Though it looked like the
bracket

954
00:49:06.726 --> 00:49:08.728
would have one glaring omission.

955
00:49:08.771 --> 00:49:10.817
[gentle upbeat music]

956
00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.341
- Mississippi State defeated Ole
Miss

957
00:49:13.385 --> 00:49:16.736
to clinch the Southeastern
Conference Championship.

958
00:49:16.779 --> 00:49:21.219
which gave them the automatic
bid to the NCAA tournament.

959
00:49:21.262 --> 00:49:24.831
The next day. Governor
Barnett issued a statement

960
00:49:24.874 --> 00:49:27.616
that Mississippi State will not
be playing

961
00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.053
in the NCAA tournament.

962
00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:34.667
- Personally. I feel it is
not for the best interest

963
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:39.715
of Mississippi State University.
or either of the races.

964
00:49:41.804 --> 00:49:44.982
- [Jerald] The governor
had issued an injunction.

965
00:49:45.025 --> 00:49:48.507
- We will do all we can. to
the point of arresting you.

966
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:51.249
when you get ready to leave
the state of Mississippi.

967
00:49:52.163 --> 00:49:55.340
- The NCAA had no idea where
to put State in their seeding

968
00:49:55.383 --> 00:49:56.776
'cause they didn't know
if State was gonna be able

969
00:49:56.819 --> 00:49:59.518
to make it. even though
they had verbally committed.

970
00:49:59.561 --> 00:50:02.912
- [Lucas] Mississippi State
was given a first-round bye.

971
00:50:02.956 --> 00:50:05.089
Their first opponent would be
the winner

972
00:50:05.132 --> 00:50:07.178
of Loyola versus Tennessee Tech.

973
00:50:09.658 --> 00:50:12.748
- [Rich] People don't realize
the amount of pressure

974
00:50:12.792 --> 00:50:14.446
that we were under.

975
00:50:14.489 --> 00:50:17.666
Not only from the KKK
and the White Knights.

976
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:19.407
but from our own people.

977
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.063
Blacks across the country.

978
00:50:23.107 --> 00:50:27.067
who were putting their hopes on
us.

979
00:50:27.111 --> 00:50:32.072
That we had to win because
the black community

980
00:50:32.594 --> 00:50:34.466
was counting on us.

981
00:50:36.076 --> 00:50:38.992
- Jerry said that he had black
people calling him saying.

982
00:50:39.036 --> 00:50:41.603
"Hey. you better not lose
to those white boys."

983
00:50:41.647 --> 00:50:43.953
- Come on. you guys.
we're rooting for you.

984
00:50:43.997 --> 00:50:45.346
we're rooting for you.

985
00:50:46.434 --> 00:50:51.396
We got so roused up that
you're gonna be hard to beat.

986
00:50:51.831 --> 00:50:54.312
You're gonna be very hard to
beat.

987
00:50:55.791 --> 00:50:59.447
The first game was against
Tennessee Tech.

988
00:50:59.491 --> 00:51:01.406
an all-white team.

989
00:51:01.449 --> 00:51:04.626
[gentle bright music]

990
00:51:06.367 --> 00:51:08.543
And that poor team.

991
00:51:08.587 --> 00:51:12.417
We went up 30. 40. we beat 'em.

992
00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:15.333
and it's still a record. 69
points.

993
00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.685
- The final score of that game

994
00:51:19.728 --> 00:51:23.123
is still the greatest
disparity in NCAA history.

995
00:51:23.167 --> 00:51:27.736
- I mean. it's just amazing
the advantage you have

996
00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.999
once you're motivated and roused
up.

997
00:51:32.176 --> 00:51:35.135
- [Lucas] The Ramblers were
eager for their next match-up.

998
00:51:35.179 --> 00:51:37.181
But with no word from
Mississippi State.

999
00:51:38.182 --> 00:51:40.532
Loyola had no idea if they'd
show up.

1000
00:51:42.969 --> 00:51:44.231
- Their coaches said we're
going.

1001
00:51:44.275 --> 00:51:45.841
their president says they're
going.

1002
00:51:45.885 --> 00:51:47.669
but everybody else in
power in the state says.

1003
00:51:47.713 --> 00:51:50.150
"No. you can't."

1004
00:51:50.194 --> 00:51:53.501
These are guys who were
raised to honor authority.

1005
00:51:53.545 --> 00:51:55.851
to obey their elders.

1006
00:51:55.895 --> 00:51:58.071
- You know. we faced jail time

1007
00:51:58.115 --> 00:52:00.900
if we failed to obey the
injunction.

1008
00:52:02.031 --> 00:52:03.076
- [Jackie] The night before the
trip.

1009
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.252
Coach McCarthy did have a team
meeting.

1010
00:52:05.296 --> 00:52:07.646
We talked. he'd said.

1011
00:52:07.689 --> 00:52:09.126
"Here's what we're gonna do."

1012
00:52:11.215 --> 00:52:14.218
[suspenseful music]

1013
00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:20.311
We aimed to leave early the next
morning.

1014
00:52:20.354 --> 00:52:23.531
as early as we could and we
headed out.

1015
00:52:25.403 --> 00:52:27.883
- [Michael] The team was
gonna split into two teams.

1016
00:52:27.927 --> 00:52:30.495
One was the decoy team.

1017
00:52:30.538 --> 00:52:32.975
- They sent our trainer
and six of our players

1018
00:52:33.019 --> 00:52:36.501
that didn't play a whole
lot out to the airport.

1019
00:52:36.544 --> 00:52:39.025
- [Robbie] They keep the five
starters and the sixth man

1020
00:52:39.068 --> 00:52:40.331
back at the dorm room.

1021
00:52:40.374 --> 00:52:42.246
- [Jackie] There're two
airports in Starkville.

1022
00:52:42.289 --> 00:52:45.249
As a decoy. one group
was going to Bryan Field.

1023
00:52:45.292 --> 00:52:46.728
- [Doug] They went out there to
see

1024
00:52:46.772 --> 00:52:50.428
if there was gonna be an
officer to serve the injunction.

1025
00:52:50.471 --> 00:52:54.649
- In that case. the
trainer with the decoys

1026
00:52:54.693 --> 00:52:58.175
was gonna phone back to
campus. tell the starting team.

1027
00:52:58.218 --> 00:53:00.133
"Don't come to the airport."

1028
00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:02.004
They had another plane waiting
for them

1029
00:53:02.048 --> 00:53:05.530
at another airport that they
were gonna take if they had to.

1030
00:53:06.618 --> 00:53:08.620
- [Jackie] And should six be
arrested.

1031
00:53:08.663 --> 00:53:11.144
six will end up in East Lansing.
Michigan.

1032
00:53:12.101 --> 00:53:14.147
- It was like "Mission
Impossible." man.

1033
00:53:15.888 --> 00:53:17.629
- We were kinda the guinea pigs.
okay?

1034
00:53:17.672 --> 00:53:21.328
I was literally scared to
death. but we were gonna go.

1035
00:53:23.112 --> 00:53:25.593
- The reserves made it
through to the airport.

1036
00:53:25.637 --> 00:53:28.335
A call was made. and they
said. "Coast is clear."

1037
00:53:28.379 --> 00:53:31.991
And the starters. Joe Dan and
Red Straud

1038
00:53:32.034 --> 00:53:33.732
and Doug Hutton. they went.

1039
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.910
And they all flew together.

1040
00:53:37.953 --> 00:53:39.781
[upbeat music]

1041
00:53:39.825 --> 00:53:42.610
- [Jackie] And as soon as
the plane left the ground.

1042
00:53:42.654 --> 00:53:44.482
you could hear the guys all
together

1043
00:53:44.525 --> 00:53:46.875
started clapping and cheering.

1044
00:53:46.919 --> 00:53:48.921
We're off. we're on our way.

1045
00:53:54.143 --> 00:53:56.233
- [Jerry] I didn't think
they were gonna come.

1046
00:53:56.276 --> 00:53:59.801
And when we got to Michigan.
they said

1047
00:53:59.845 --> 00:54:02.848
Mississippi State is gonna play
you.

1048
00:54:04.937 --> 00:54:06.678
- To know that cops are chasing
them

1049
00:54:06.721 --> 00:54:09.550
and that what they're doing
is gonna create a stir.

1050
00:54:09.594 --> 00:54:12.205
And then just even getting
psychologically ready

1051
00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:13.685
for an NCAA tournament game.

1052
00:54:13.728 --> 00:54:16.296
which they had never done
before.

1053
00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:18.255
I'm sure they were probably
tapped out.

1054
00:54:19.386 --> 00:54:22.694
- [Jackie] How many people are
gonna support us being there?

1055
00:54:22.737 --> 00:54:23.608
We don't know.

1056
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:27.046
- [Doug] Everything was very
quiet.

1057
00:54:27.089 --> 00:54:28.439
We're all sitting there. you
know.

1058
00:54:28.482 --> 00:54:30.005
about halfway wanting to cry.

1059
00:54:31.224 --> 00:54:34.314
[gentle triumphant music]

1060
00:54:34.358 --> 00:54:36.142
- And when we got on the floor
that night.

1061
00:54:36.185 --> 00:54:40.407
and all of a sudden. the
MSU fight song was played.

1062
00:54:40.451 --> 00:54:42.583
[spectators cheering]

1063
00:54:42.627 --> 00:54:45.804
[lively upbeat music]

1064
00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:54.595
Here we are. a bunch of
white kids in opposition

1065
00:54:54.639 --> 00:54:57.729
to a movement against black
athletes.

1066
00:54:57.772 --> 00:55:01.950
to play something as easy or
simple as a basketball game?

1067
00:55:01.994 --> 00:55:05.606
To walk into a gym of 15. 18.000
people.

1068
00:55:08.348 --> 00:55:09.175
Wow.

1069
00:55:12.352 --> 00:55:14.311
Could it really be happening?
That. um.

1070
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.141
[solemn music]

1071
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:22.971
- [Robbie] They had no clue

1072
00:55:23.015 --> 00:55:24.625
that they would be that
welcomed.

1073
00:55:25.757 --> 00:55:28.020
- Doug] Joe Dan Gold was our
captain

1074
00:55:28.063 --> 00:55:31.066
and he went out to shake
hands before the tip-off.

1075
00:55:32.807 --> 00:55:34.331
- [Jerry] There was no cheering.

1076
00:55:34.374 --> 00:55:36.333
The place was quiet.

1077
00:55:36.376 --> 00:55:39.858
Everybody was watching
us. you could feel it.

1078
00:55:39.901 --> 00:55:43.992
I didn't hear anything
the referees were saying.

1079
00:55:44.036 --> 00:55:48.083
I was looking at Joe Dan
and he was looking at me.

1080
00:55:48.127 --> 00:55:52.566
We both went to shake
hands and the place lit up.

1081
00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:53.785
Pop. pop. pow!

1082
00:55:56.483 --> 00:55:58.355
- [Judy] The cameras just went
crazy.

1083
00:55:59.443 --> 00:56:00.922
- [Jackie] Almost turned into
daylight.

1084
00:56:00.966 --> 00:56:03.316
- [Rick C] I mean everyone
understood

1085
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.537
how important that moment was.

1086
00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.321
It was captured for the ages.

1087
00:56:09.496 --> 00:56:12.325
- [Jerry] I said. "This
is more than a game.

1088
00:56:12.369 --> 00:56:13.935
This is history."

1089
00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:19.593
- For our two captains to shake
hands

1090
00:56:19.637 --> 00:56:23.684
and acknowledge the fact
that. "Hey. we're here."

1091
00:56:23.728 --> 00:56:26.339
[somber music]

1092
00:56:32.084 --> 00:56:34.216
- [Lucas] The night would
forever be known

1093
00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.696
as the Game of Change.

1094
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:47.447
When the final buzzer sounded.

1095
00:56:47.491 --> 00:56:51.320
Loyola had earned the win.
sending them to the Elite Eight.

1096
00:56:51.364 --> 00:56:54.628
While Mississippi State faced
the reality of returning home.

1097
00:56:54.672 --> 00:56:57.457
and the consequences
that would be waiting.

1098
00:56:57.501 --> 00:56:59.328
- I don't know. we could have
played a whole lot of games

1099
00:56:59.372 --> 00:57:00.895
and probably never beaten them.

1100
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:05.073
Coach came in. and his first
thing he says

1101
00:57:05.117 --> 00:57:06.292
when he popped in that door.

1102
00:57:06.335 --> 00:57:08.686
is "Boys. you get your head up."

1103
00:57:08.729 --> 00:57:10.078
He said. "Y'all have done
something

1104
00:57:10.122 --> 00:57:12.429
that nobody in Mississippi's
ever done. you know.

1105
00:57:12.472 --> 00:57:14.300
Y'all have nothing to be ashamed
of."

1106
00:57:17.521 --> 00:57:18.739
- Well. obviously our flight
home

1107
00:57:18.783 --> 00:57:20.393
was a disappointing flight home.

1108
00:57:21.307 --> 00:57:23.875
Yet. it wasn't disappointing

1109
00:57:23.918 --> 00:57:26.704
because we had accomplished
what we set out to do.

1110
00:57:28.096 --> 00:57:30.316
- The Mississippi State team
didn't know

1111
00:57:30.359 --> 00:57:33.145
what they would find when they
got home.

1112
00:57:33.188 --> 00:57:34.538
That was the danger.

1113
00:57:34.581 --> 00:57:36.061
That was the element that
they were dealing with.

1114
00:57:36.104 --> 00:57:38.498
it had to be in the back of
their minds the whole time.

1115
00:57:38.542 --> 00:57:41.501
[soft solemn music]

1116
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:44.417
They get back to Mississippi

1117
00:57:46.114 --> 00:57:48.943
and there's a crowd
treating them like heroes.

1118
00:57:48.987 --> 00:57:52.164
[spectators cheering]

1119
00:57:58.213 --> 00:58:00.172
You know. the best thing is to
win.

1120
00:58:00.215 --> 00:58:02.000
The second best thing is to
lose.

1121
00:58:02.043 --> 00:58:04.393
That means you got a chance to
compete.

1122
00:58:04.437 --> 00:58:07.919
Without the ability to
compete. you got nothing.

1123
00:58:09.268 --> 00:58:11.400
- Differences of opinion that we
have

1124
00:58:11.444 --> 00:58:13.664
and ill feelings that we have.

1125
00:58:13.707 --> 00:58:17.058
but basketball and sports
can do an awful lot

1126
00:58:17.102 --> 00:58:18.407
to bring people together.

1127
00:58:20.758 --> 00:58:23.151
- [Lucas] As the NCAA
tournament continued.

1128
00:58:23.195 --> 00:58:25.284
Loyola defeated Illinois and
Duke

1129
00:58:25.327 --> 00:58:27.373
to advance to the championship
game

1130
00:58:27.416 --> 00:58:30.158
for the first time in school
history.

1131
00:58:30.202 --> 00:58:32.857
The most anticipated
contest of the season.

1132
00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:35.947
Loyola versus Cincinnati. was
set.

1133
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:39.777
- The night we beat Duke.
what I remember most vividly

1134
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:42.910
is Vic Rouse jumping on the bed

1135
00:58:42.954 --> 00:58:44.912
at four o'clock in the morning

1136
00:58:44.956 --> 00:58:49.351
saying he's gonna be
looking at his NCAA watch.

1137
00:58:49.395 --> 00:58:52.137
[laughing] I remember that
vividly.

1138
00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:53.965
'Cause they didn't give
out rings at that time.

1139
00:58:54.008 --> 00:58:55.532
They gave out watches.

1140
00:58:55.575 --> 00:58:57.969
I don't think any of the guys
got to bed

1141
00:58:58.012 --> 00:58:59.100
til at least 4:00 in the
morning.

1142
00:58:59.144 --> 00:59:01.146
And that might have been.

1143
00:59:01.189 --> 00:59:03.888
the guys might have been
dragging a little bit.

1144
00:59:03.931 --> 00:59:05.759
- [Red] NCAA Championship ball
game.

1145
00:59:05.803 --> 00:59:07.805
It's a ding-dong-dilly of a
battle tonight

1146
00:59:07.848 --> 00:59:10.198
at Louisville as we
will have the Bearcats.

1147
00:59:10.242 --> 00:59:12.897
coached by Ed Jucker.
against the Ramblers.

1148
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:17.118
coached by George Ireland
of Loyola of Chicago.

1149
00:59:17.162 --> 00:59:19.599
- [Lucas] For the first
time in NCAA history.

1150
00:59:19.643 --> 00:59:23.429
seven black starters across
both teams took the floor.

1151
00:59:23.472 --> 00:59:25.649
And in a nationally televised
game.

1152
00:59:25.692 --> 00:59:27.346
the entire country was watching.

1153
00:59:29.217 --> 00:59:32.873
On Chicago local radio.
Loyola's very own announcer.

1154
00:59:32.917 --> 00:59:35.006
Red Rush was calling the game.

1155
00:59:35.876 --> 00:59:38.575
a voice no one would forget
by the end of the night.

1156
00:59:38.618 --> 00:59:40.925
- [Red] We are hungry for a
championship.

1157
00:59:40.968 --> 00:59:43.623
so please bring one home to us.
won't you?

1158
00:59:43.667 --> 00:59:45.277
- It was bringing chills to me

1159
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.931
to be honest with you. watching
that.

1160
00:59:46.974 --> 00:59:49.063
- We had 150 young nuns there.

1161
00:59:49.107 --> 00:59:51.109
looking at this little
black-and-white TV

1162
00:59:51.152 --> 00:59:53.024
so we could watch that game.

1163
00:59:55.548 --> 01:00:00.553
- Probably the audience at
the time was pro-Cincinnati.

1164
01:00:01.902 --> 01:00:04.209
Nobody had won three titles in a
row.

1165
01:00:05.645 --> 01:00:07.212
- I guess the excitement starts

1166
01:00:07.255 --> 01:00:11.259
when you're running out
through the crowded area.

1167
01:00:12.173 --> 01:00:15.655
I could not see anybody that I
knew there.

1168
01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:17.352
but I knew they were there.

1169
01:00:17.396 --> 01:00:19.616
Okay. there was that many
people.

1170
01:00:19.659 --> 01:00:21.966
[spectators cheering]

1171
01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:23.228
It felt as though

1172
01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:24.969
I'd been looking forward
to this all my life.

1173
01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.929
I would say more excited.

1174
01:00:28.973 --> 01:00:32.150
somewhat nervous. but more
excited.

1175
01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:36.894
I just said. "We gotta
get to a good start."

1176
01:00:38.983 --> 01:00:40.854
- At tip-off. I had this little
habit

1177
01:00:40.898 --> 01:00:43.596
where I always reached
down and touched my sock.

1178
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.773
And that night. I didn't touch
my sock.

1179
01:00:46.817 --> 01:00:49.515
which said to me I must have
been nervous.

1180
01:00:50.385 --> 01:00:51.604
- [Red] The ball's in the air

1181
01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:53.954
and controlled by Cincinnati's
Tony Yates.

1182
01:00:53.998 --> 01:00:56.130
So the Bearcats have got
the ball on the move.

1183
01:00:56.174 --> 01:00:58.437
He brings the ball over
the 10-second timeline.

1184
01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.004
The Bearcats control down here
to Bonham.

1185
01:01:00.047 --> 01:01:01.832
fires from the baseline.
jumps. shoots. off.

1186
01:01:01.875 --> 01:01:04.530
no good. and Wilson stuffs it
through.

1187
01:01:04.573 --> 01:01:08.316
George Wilson went high in the
sky and stuffed it through.

1188
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.623
- We were the best team. without
a doubt.

1189
01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.886
Deliberate game. set picks.

1190
01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.540
take our time with the ball.

1191
01:01:15.933 --> 01:01:17.021
- [Lucas] Right at tip-off.

1192
01:01:17.064 --> 01:01:19.414
Cincinnati had momentum on their
side.

1193
01:01:19.458 --> 01:01:21.416
Both teams studied their
opponent.

1194
01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.985
their styles. tactics.
and their biggest threat.

1195
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:26.160
- [Red] Harkness out to Ron
Miller.

1196
01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:27.727
they're going to try to set the
pattern.

1197
01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:29.947
they're not going in that
full-court-press incidentally.

1198
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:32.689
- Tom Thacker. the best
defensive player

1199
01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:34.952
in college basketball at the
time.

1200
01:01:34.995 --> 01:01:38.259
At the beginning of the game I
said. "I'ma get in his head."

1201
01:01:40.522 --> 01:01:41.567
- [Michael] He was going in

1202
01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:44.135
for what he thought was an easy
layup.

1203
01:01:44.178 --> 01:01:47.181
He thought he had Tom Thacker
beat.

1204
01:01:47.225 --> 01:01:48.835
- Instead of going left.

1205
01:01:48.879 --> 01:01:50.837
where I know they had scouted me

1206
01:01:50.881 --> 01:01:54.145
and I go left 90% of the time.

1207
01:01:54.188 --> 01:01:56.582
I said. "I'ma go right on him."

1208
01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:58.062
- [Red] They're going to
try to set the pattern.

1209
01:01:58.105 --> 01:01:59.585
There goes Harkness driving the
baseline.

1210
01:01:59.628 --> 01:02:00.804
and the ball knocked out of
bounds

1211
01:02:00.847 --> 01:02:03.720
by Tom Thacker who is on
Harkness.

1212
01:02:03.763 --> 01:02:05.330
- He slapped the ball away.

1213
01:02:05.373 --> 01:02:09.464
I could not believe what he had
just done.

1214
01:02:09.508 --> 01:02:13.338
Nobody would think of it
as being awesome except me.

1215
01:02:13.381 --> 01:02:15.732
He knocked me out of my game.

1216
01:02:15.775 --> 01:02:19.083
- [Michael] From that moment
on. he was afraid of Thacker.

1217
01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:20.824
Thacker was in his head.

1218
01:02:20.867 --> 01:02:22.739
- [Red] Being guarded by
Thacker. Harkness goes up

1219
01:02:22.782 --> 01:02:25.045
off the left side. jumps.
an 8-footer. off. no good.

1220
01:02:25.089 --> 01:02:27.787
and Wilson clears the backboard
backing up underneath.

1221
01:02:28.962 --> 01:02:32.444
- When I got around him.
there's George Wilson.

1222
01:02:32.487 --> 01:02:35.490
They had a double where
they had me boxed in.

1223
01:02:35.534 --> 01:02:36.317
- [Red] Down to Harkness.

1224
01:02:36.361 --> 01:02:37.405
Harkness has yet to score.

1225
01:02:37.449 --> 01:02:38.972
we're going to see what happens.

1226
01:02:39.016 --> 01:02:40.321
He backs up. he always shoots
when he does. let's wait.

1227
01:02:40.365 --> 01:02:42.323
He turns around. jumps.
shoots. off. no good.

1228
01:02:42.367 --> 01:02:44.630
and the ball knocked
into the hands of Wilson.

1229
01:02:44.673 --> 01:02:47.154
- They had all of the things to
stop me.

1230
01:02:47.198 --> 01:02:49.374
They just scouted us very. very
well.

1231
01:02:49.417 --> 01:02:51.158
- [Red] Off to Miller
to the right-hand side.

1232
01:02:51.202 --> 01:02:53.987
goes to the baseline. jumps.
an 8-footer. off. no good.

1233
01:02:54.031 --> 01:02:56.163
So Ron Miller has got a foul.

1234
01:02:56.207 --> 01:02:58.687
- We'd had slow starts before.

1235
01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:03.344
But this night. something is
wrong.

1236
01:03:03.388 --> 01:03:05.346
[dramatic music]

1237
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:08.219
- [Lucas] With the threat of
Jerry Harkness neutralized.

1238
01:03:08.262 --> 01:03:09.655
Ed Jucker turned his attack

1239
01:03:09.698 --> 01:03:14.225
on what Loyola relied
on most. their speed.

1240
01:03:14.268 --> 01:03:16.009
- [Red] Passing over to Bonham
behind the free-throw line.

1241
01:03:16.053 --> 01:03:17.097
it is off the iron. no good

1242
01:03:17.141 --> 01:03:18.969
and Miller controls it off of
there.

1243
01:03:19.012 --> 01:03:20.318
They slow down that fast break.

1244
01:03:20.361 --> 01:03:22.624
9:56 left to go in the first
half.

1245
01:03:22.668 --> 01:03:25.584
- They took away our fast
breaks.

1246
01:03:25.627 --> 01:03:27.934
- We wanted to cut loose all the
time.

1247
01:03:27.978 --> 01:03:29.370
We wanted to get the ball and
go.

1248
01:03:29.414 --> 01:03:30.981
and get the ball and go.

1249
01:03:31.024 --> 01:03:34.854
They didn't take enough
shots for us to get going.

1250
01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:37.814
They were never in a hurry to
take a shot.

1251
01:03:37.857 --> 01:03:40.947
- [Red] Thacker way over. hands
it back to Larry Shingleton.

1252
01:03:40.991 --> 01:03:42.253
They have a seven point lead

1253
01:03:42.296 --> 01:03:43.689
and when Cincinnati's
got that kind of a lead.

1254
01:03:43.732 --> 01:03:44.821
it's pretty tough.

1255
01:03:44.864 --> 01:03:46.431
- So they didn't miss a lot of
shots.

1256
01:03:46.474 --> 01:03:50.000
So there was not an opportunity
for us to get rebounds.

1257
01:03:50.043 --> 01:03:53.612
And for some reason. we could
not ever adjust to that style.

1258
01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:57.137
I don't remember having a
fast-break in the first half.

1259
01:03:57.181 --> 01:03:59.052
- We just never could get
started.

1260
01:03:59.096 --> 01:04:00.401
And we weren't shooting well.

1261
01:04:00.445 --> 01:04:02.099
Shooting percentage was
terrible.

1262
01:04:02.142 --> 01:04:04.710
- [Red] The Ramblers with a
13-footer. up. off. no good.

1263
01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:06.407
Over to Miller. jumping from
behind the free-throw lane.

1264
01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:09.236
it is up. and short. no
good. and Thacker clears it.

1265
01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.325
- How could we miss that many
shots?

1266
01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:13.850
I mean they were easy shots.
they were wide open shots.

1267
01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:15.199
and we were missing shots.

1268
01:04:15.242 --> 01:04:17.679
- I knew that we were much
better

1269
01:04:17.723 --> 01:04:19.159
than we were playing.

1270
01:04:19.203 --> 01:04:21.901
A lot of people were
probably watching at home.

1271
01:04:21.945 --> 01:04:24.034
And we come there and flop.

1272
01:04:25.339 --> 01:04:27.776
- Everyone on that team was
nervous.

1273
01:04:28.821 --> 01:04:33.130
We were out of sync.
largely because our leader

1274
01:04:33.173 --> 01:04:36.568
was not having a good half.

1275
01:04:36.611 --> 01:04:38.875
- [Michael] Jerry did not feel
confident.

1276
01:04:38.918 --> 01:04:41.399
If Jerry was not confident.
the rest of the team

1277
01:04:41.442 --> 01:04:44.054
had to wonder. "What's to become
of us?"

1278
01:04:44.097 --> 01:04:45.707
- [Red] Miller over to Harkness.

1279
01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:47.100
He goes down near the baseline.

1280
01:04:47.144 --> 01:04:48.841
Bonham's on him. dribbles
under. fakes. shoots.

1281
01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:50.538
and he is knocked down.

1282
01:04:50.582 --> 01:04:51.844
But getting the ball.

1283
01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:55.152
Egan sets. he shoots. it
is rolling off. no good.

1284
01:04:55.195 --> 01:04:57.502
Over to Ron Miller. he
jumps. he shoots. a 6-footer.

1285
01:04:57.545 --> 01:04:59.721
rolls off. no good. and the
ball is knocked out of bounds.

1286
01:04:59.765 --> 01:05:01.680
last touched by Vic Rouse.

1287
01:05:01.723 --> 01:05:06.467
At halftime the score is 29 to
21.

1288
01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:08.513
- The assumption by everybody
is that this is a gimme.

1289
01:05:08.556 --> 01:05:10.428
Cincinnati's got it. it's in the
bag.

1290
01:05:12.821 --> 01:05:15.433
[gentle bright music]

1291
01:05:15.476 --> 01:05:17.696
- The first half of the
championship game

1292
01:05:18.827 --> 01:05:20.177
is kind of a blur.

1293
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.789
I remember Jerry had a very bad
game.

1294
01:05:25.225 --> 01:05:26.705
but so did everyone else.

1295
01:05:28.054 --> 01:05:29.926
We played the worst game of the
year.

1296
01:05:32.145 --> 01:05:34.887
Of the four years that
I was around Ireland.

1297
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:36.367
I've often thought

1298
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:40.762
that George Ireland's greatest
achievement as a coach

1299
01:05:40.806 --> 01:05:43.243
was what he said at halftime.

1300
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:49.510
He walks into the locker
room and said to us.

1301
01:05:49.554 --> 01:05:53.819
"You know. you just played
the worst half of basketball

1302
01:05:53.862 --> 01:05:55.908
I think we've played all year."

1303
01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.171
And he says. "I'm not worried
about it.

1304
01:05:59.346 --> 01:06:01.348
We're gonna go out there the
second half.

1305
01:06:01.392 --> 01:06:04.264
and you're gonna play better.
and we'll win the game."

1306
01:06:05.744 --> 01:06:08.399
There were other times
when we would be winning

1307
01:06:08.442 --> 01:06:10.705
by 10. 12. 15 points.

1308
01:06:10.749 --> 01:06:12.446
and he would come into the
locker room

1309
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:14.666
and he would start throwing
things around.

1310
01:06:14.709 --> 01:06:17.538
telling us how lousy we were
playing.

1311
01:06:17.582 --> 01:06:20.324
But at this moment. that night.

1312
01:06:20.367 --> 01:06:23.718
he was the complete
opposite of all of those.

1313
01:06:25.068 --> 01:06:27.374
He said. "We're better than
that.

1314
01:06:27.418 --> 01:06:29.333
You're better than that."

1315
01:06:29.376 --> 01:06:31.422
He said. "We'll get 'em the
second half."

1316
01:06:33.728 --> 01:06:36.557
I've often felt that was his
finest hour.

1317
01:06:36.601 --> 01:06:40.648
[soft suspenseful music]

1318
01:06:40.692 --> 01:06:43.869
[spectators cheering]

1319
01:06:46.741 --> 01:06:48.352
- [Red] The ball is up and
controlled

1320
01:06:48.395 --> 01:06:50.832
by Jerry Harkness over near the
sideline.

1321
01:06:50.876 --> 01:06:52.573
Back to Miller the ball goes.

1322
01:06:52.617 --> 01:06:54.271
Back down to Harkness on the
right side.

1323
01:06:54.314 --> 01:06:56.273
going inside the
free-throw lane. shoots up.

1324
01:06:56.316 --> 01:06:57.839
and it goes off to Rouse.

1325
01:06:57.883 --> 01:07:00.625
he scores as he controls the
board.

1326
01:07:00.668 --> 01:07:04.933
- I never heard anyone say
they had lost their hope.

1327
01:07:04.977 --> 01:07:07.066
But if you're watching that
game.

1328
01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:09.634
you had to think. "Things
are not going our way

1329
01:07:09.677 --> 01:07:12.506
and I don't see how they're
gonna change."

1330
01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:14.508
- [Lucas] Bolstered by
their coach's confidence.

1331
01:07:14.552 --> 01:07:17.033
Loyola came out of the
half ready to fight.

1332
01:07:17.076 --> 01:07:20.210
but Cincinnati looked just
as strong as they started.

1333
01:07:20.253 --> 01:07:21.994
With Jerry still held at bay.

1334
01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.952
the Bearcats kept the pace slow.

1335
01:07:23.996 --> 01:07:25.606
making it even harder to catch
up.

1336
01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:27.173
- [Red] Yates has got it over
the far side

1337
01:07:27.217 --> 01:07:28.174
to Larry Shingleton.

1338
01:07:28.218 --> 01:07:29.567
Larry down the corner to Bonham.

1339
01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:31.743
he jumps. an 18-footer is up and
good.

1340
01:07:31.786 --> 01:07:35.399
45 to 30. Cincinnati leading by
15 points.

1341
01:07:35.442 --> 01:07:37.879
you wouldn't believe it
unless you were here.

1342
01:07:37.923 --> 01:07:39.316
- [Jack] I'm thinking to myself.

1343
01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:40.926
"How do we make this comeback?

1344
01:07:40.969 --> 01:07:42.536
How do we do it?"

1345
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.973
- Cincinnati was about
the best defensive team

1346
01:07:45.017 --> 01:07:46.497
in the United States.

1347
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.716
so how do you overcome that
deficit?

1348
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.893
- [Michael] It's a long.
hard hill to climb.

1349
01:07:51.937 --> 01:07:54.287
But maybe there's some life in
them yet.

1350
01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:56.681
- [Red] Rouse clears the
backboard for Loyola.

1351
01:07:58.030 --> 01:07:59.379
- [Rich] Take the deep breath

1352
01:07:59.423 --> 01:08:02.600
and you wait for your time to
hit.

1353
01:08:02.643 --> 01:08:04.993
- [Red] 47-34. 13 point lead.

1354
01:08:05.037 --> 01:08:07.170
Here's Ron Miller going
down to the baseline.

1355
01:08:07.213 --> 01:08:09.389
Jumps. shoots. scores.

1356
01:08:09.433 --> 01:08:10.564
Going in the lane. and back. and
pass.

1357
01:08:10.608 --> 01:08:12.218
it goes to Harkness. the
baseline.

1358
01:08:12.262 --> 01:08:13.393
jumps. off. no good.

1359
01:08:13.437 --> 01:08:15.700
he can't get it. Rouse gets the
rebound.

1360
01:08:15.743 --> 01:08:18.746
- It was about five
minutes to go in the game.

1361
01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:20.357
I hadn't scored a basket.

1362
01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.575
- [Red] Shoots. up. off. no
good.

1363
01:08:21.619 --> 01:08:22.968
And Leslie Hunter clears it.

1364
01:08:23.011 --> 01:08:25.536
There they go. Harkness.
and the ball is stolen.

1365
01:08:25.579 --> 01:08:29.017
as Harkness passes. it's
stolen by Larry Shingleton.

1366
01:08:29.061 --> 01:08:30.802
Beautiful interception by Larry.

1367
01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:34.849
- [Lucas] Loyola was
battling every possession.

1368
01:08:34.893 --> 01:08:37.287
But still down seven. every miss

1369
01:08:37.330 --> 01:08:39.245
made it painfully clear.

1370
01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:44.207
if Jerry Harkness couldn't
score. Loyola was finished.

1371
01:08:47.253 --> 01:08:50.126
- Jerry had a big dream. had big
ideas

1372
01:08:50.169 --> 01:08:53.607
about his friends at
home watching him on TV.

1373
01:08:53.651 --> 01:08:56.741
How this was gonna be triumph of
the poor.

1374
01:08:56.784 --> 01:08:59.744
be triumphant back in New York.

1375
01:08:59.787 --> 01:09:02.573
And he saw all that slipping
away.

1376
01:09:02.616 --> 01:09:05.619
- I would not have been
able to face myself.

1377
01:09:05.663 --> 01:09:09.319
in life. because I played so
bad.

1378
01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:14.324
I would have felt bad
for the rest of my life.

1379
01:09:17.065 --> 01:09:20.721
But God has always put me in a
situation.

1380
01:09:22.114 --> 01:09:25.770
going on welfare. nothing to
eat.

1381
01:09:27.119 --> 01:09:30.035
And I think of my mom getting us
through.

1382
01:09:31.341 --> 01:09:35.171
coming out of the
hospital. and telling us.

1383
01:09:36.084 --> 01:09:37.782
"We're going to make it."

1384
01:09:39.044 --> 01:09:43.004
I realized that all of that
drive and determination

1385
01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:46.269
came from my mom.

1386
01:09:48.096 --> 01:09:50.795
Ireland put in a different play

1387
01:09:50.838 --> 01:09:53.667
that Cincinnati had not seen.

1388
01:09:53.711 --> 01:09:56.540
I felt finally. maybe this is it
for me.

1389
01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:03.373
- [Red] Egan. Egan to Harkness.
turn around. jumper's good.

1390
01:10:03.416 --> 01:10:05.070
Jerry made his first basket.

1391
01:10:05.113 --> 01:10:10.206
He made it. he might do
it. 48 to 43. 48 to 43.

1392
01:10:10.249 --> 01:10:11.424
- [Jack] We can win this game.

1393
01:10:11.468 --> 01:10:13.948
At that point. we can win.

1394
01:10:13.992 --> 01:10:15.776
- [Red] Here's Thacker with that
ball.

1395
01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.648
Passing down. intercepted by
Harkness.

1396
01:10:17.691 --> 01:10:20.520
Here goes Jerry. lays
it up. and he scores.

1397
01:10:20.564 --> 01:10:24.655
Harkness scores. beautiful.
beautiful. beautiful.

1398
01:10:26.439 --> 01:10:29.007
48-45. 4:16 left to go.

1399
01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:31.314
Oh. is this a ball game now.

1400
01:10:31.357 --> 01:10:33.707
Out to Harkness on the left
side. he's driving down.

1401
01:10:33.751 --> 01:10:38.756
he's under. lays it up. and
scores. he scores. he scores.

1402
01:10:39.191 --> 01:10:41.846
- Jerry was the primary reason

1403
01:10:41.889 --> 01:10:46.242
that we were able to come
back and get into the game.

1404
01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:51.203
Once he heated up. the rest
of the team followed suit.

1405
01:10:52.987 --> 01:10:56.991
- [Ron] We just started
playing harder. much harder.

1406
01:10:57.035 --> 01:10:58.384
- [Red] Look at Hunter get that
ball.

1407
01:10:58.428 --> 01:10:59.907
Miller on the right side.

1408
01:10:59.951 --> 01:11:01.735
a bounce pass into Hunter.
turn around. layup. and oh!

1409
01:11:01.779 --> 01:11:04.390
Goal tending. goal tending.
they finally called it.

1410
01:11:04.434 --> 01:11:06.392
It's 51 to 50.

1411
01:11:06.436 --> 01:11:09.090
- The crowd started to come
around.

1412
01:11:09.134 --> 01:11:11.005
'cause we started to close the
gap.

1413
01:11:11.049 --> 01:11:13.138
- [Red] Here comes Harkness. he
lays it up

1414
01:11:13.181 --> 01:11:17.490
and it is tipped in by Hunter.
19 seconds. 15 seconds. 16.

1415
01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:20.711
Shingleton's got it. and a foul.

1416
01:11:20.754 --> 01:11:22.756
Harkness fouled him
purposefully. he had to do it.

1417
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:25.019
- [Announcer] 12 seconds to play

1418
01:11:25.063 --> 01:11:27.500
and it's bedlam here in
Louisville. Kentucky.

1419
01:11:28.806 --> 01:11:32.766
53 to 52. Cincinnati by one
single point.

1420
01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:35.378
And going to the line
will be Larry Shingleton.

1421
01:11:35.421 --> 01:11:37.554
- Larry Shingleton was one of

1422
01:11:37.597 --> 01:11:41.775
the best free-throw
shooters in the nation.

1423
01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:46.780
So. you know. when he stepped
to the line. my heart sank.

1424
01:11:47.172 --> 01:11:48.826
- [Announcer] With 12 seconds to
go.

1425
01:11:48.869 --> 01:11:50.393
Shingleton will go to the line.

1426
01:11:50.436 --> 01:11:53.483
If he should miss. they
would have time of course

1427
01:11:53.526 --> 01:11:56.399
to go down the court and
perhaps take that one shot.

1428
01:11:56.442 --> 01:11:58.618
And Tom. anything can
happen at this point.

1429
01:12:00.011 --> 01:12:02.448
- I am out there praying.

1430
01:12:02.492 --> 01:12:05.321
'Cause if he hits both. over.

1431
01:12:05.364 --> 01:12:07.714
No doubt about it. the game is
over.

1432
01:12:07.758 --> 01:12:11.327
[spectators whistling]

1433
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:12.676
[spectators cheering]

1434
01:12:12.719 --> 01:12:16.114
- [Announcer] Well. there's
one of them. 54 to 52.

1435
01:12:16.157 --> 01:12:21.162
- I said. "Dear Lord. please.
please just give us a chance."

1436
01:12:22.033 --> 01:12:23.208
- [Announcer] Larry Shingleton

1437
01:12:23.251 --> 01:12:25.428
with only his second point of
the night.

1438
01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:28.474
And now. perhaps he can
ice the ball game for them.

1439
01:12:30.171 --> 01:12:33.566
[soft suspenseful music]

1440
01:12:35.307 --> 01:12:39.224
It's short. and it comes off to
Loyola.

1441
01:12:39.267 --> 01:12:41.835
- Les gets the rebound. perfect
position.

1442
01:12:42.793 --> 01:12:44.229
And there's a guy from
Cincinnati

1443
01:12:44.272 --> 01:12:48.189
who swipes at the ball as
Les passes the ball to me.

1444
01:12:48.233 --> 01:12:51.105
And as I catch the
ball. I take one dribble

1445
01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:54.587
and I see Jerry streaking
toward the basket.

1446
01:12:54.631 --> 01:12:57.851
I saw him break. I knew
he could get his shot.

1447
01:12:57.895 --> 01:12:59.592
because that's his spot.

1448
01:12:59.636 --> 01:13:01.768
- Jerry did what he does best.

1449
01:13:01.812 --> 01:13:05.424
He cocked that left hand behind
his head.

1450
01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:06.860
- I didn't feel anything.

1451
01:13:08.122 --> 01:13:10.864
I didn't feel the ball leave my
hand.

1452
01:13:10.908 --> 01:13:13.432
If I would have had an air ball.

1453
01:13:13.476 --> 01:13:15.086
I wouldn't have been surprised.

1454
01:13:16.087 --> 01:13:17.610
I just let it go.

1455
01:13:17.654 --> 01:13:19.612
- [Red] No good. and
Leslie Hunter has got it.

1456
01:13:19.656 --> 01:13:21.440
To Ron Miller. they've got a
fast break.

1457
01:13:21.484 --> 01:13:24.051
Down to Harkness. he jumps.
he shoots. he scores.

1458
01:13:25.836 --> 01:13:28.795
He scores. he scores. he scores!

1459
01:13:28.839 --> 01:13:31.450
- Perfect fast break within
seconds.

1460
01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:33.626
And that. to me. was who Loyola
was.

1461
01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:36.455
That's how we played. just like
that.

1462
01:13:36.499 --> 01:13:37.674
- [Announcer] One second to go.

1463
01:13:37.717 --> 01:13:39.240
and we're going into overtime.

1464
01:13:40.807 --> 01:13:43.810
And the score is all tied. 54 to
54.

1465
01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:47.945
[timer beeping]

1466
01:13:47.988 --> 01:13:49.599
The clock is running with nine
seconds.

1467
01:13:49.642 --> 01:13:51.209
Harkness takes it. he makes it.

1468
01:13:51.252 --> 01:13:53.254
It's all tied up.

1469
01:13:53.298 --> 01:13:56.475
[film reel whirring]

1470
01:13:56.519 --> 01:13:57.824
- [John] There was some
controversy

1471
01:13:57.868 --> 01:14:01.088
that Ronnie Miller might have
gotten away

1472
01:14:01.132 --> 01:14:02.655
with a traveling call.

1473
01:14:03.743 --> 01:14:06.659
- That's true. I gotta say it.

1474
01:14:08.922 --> 01:14:12.752
- There's the Ronnie.
he did an extra step.

1475
01:14:12.796 --> 01:14:15.842
- They know what they did.
they know what happened.

1476
01:14:15.886 --> 01:14:19.846
- It was so close that
nobody in their mind

1477
01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:22.719
as a referee is gonna call that.

1478
01:14:22.762 --> 01:14:25.243
- There was no question
in my mind. he walked.

1479
01:14:25.286 --> 01:14:27.419
- Did he get away with
something?

1480
01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:30.378
Yeah. they didn't blow a
whistle.

1481
01:14:32.206 --> 01:14:34.644
- I didn't travel because
the ref didn't call it.

1482
01:14:35.906 --> 01:14:39.170
- And the basket's made.
We're into overtime.

1483
01:14:39.213 --> 01:14:43.261
[spectators cheering]
[upbeat music]

1484
01:14:43.304 --> 01:14:45.350
- [Announcer] It is
absolutely a madhouse here.

1485
01:14:45.393 --> 01:14:47.831
And it's all tied. 54-54.

1486
01:14:47.874 --> 01:14:50.007
Loyola getting 33 points
in the second half.

1487
01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:51.095
Cincinnati getting 25.

1488
01:14:51.138 --> 01:14:53.793
And Jerry Harkness. who had had

1489
01:14:53.837 --> 01:14:57.231
perhaps his most miserable
night in his college career.

1490
01:14:57.275 --> 01:14:58.537
came back to become the hero

1491
01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:00.844
to tie it up with three seconds
to go.

1492
01:15:00.887 --> 01:15:03.324
- [Red] But when David
comes up against Goliath.

1493
01:15:03.368 --> 01:15:04.717
what can you do?

1494
01:15:04.761 --> 01:15:05.849
There it goes down to
Harkness. he's underneath.

1495
01:15:05.892 --> 01:15:07.677
he lays it up. he scores. he
scores.

1496
01:15:08.852 --> 01:15:10.767
56 to 54. it's a dilly!

1497
01:15:12.377 --> 01:15:13.944
As the Ramblers are out in front

1498
01:15:13.987 --> 01:15:17.034
for the first time in this ball
game.

1499
01:15:17.077 --> 01:15:18.601
- [Ron] What I remember most
about the last five minutes

1500
01:15:18.644 --> 01:15:20.211
was that desperation.

1501
01:15:20.254 --> 01:15:22.256
Keep clawing until the bitter
end

1502
01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.954
and something good will happen.

1503
01:15:25.303 --> 01:15:26.347
- [Announcer] Thacker
trying to get one inside.

1504
01:15:26.391 --> 01:15:30.221
he goes to Wilson. and Wilson
scores.

1505
01:15:30.264 --> 01:15:33.441
- Imagine playing an entire game

1506
01:15:33.485 --> 01:15:37.228
without any break. and an
overtime.

1507
01:15:37.271 --> 01:15:39.491
Those guys had no time to rest.

1508
01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:43.626
They were constantly going. All
five.

1509
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:45.149
- [Announcer] They have gone all
the way

1510
01:15:45.192 --> 01:15:46.977
without a substitute.

1511
01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:50.720
And I'm wondering. Tom Hamlin.
if this isn't beginning

1512
01:15:50.763 --> 01:15:52.765
to wear on Loyola a little bit.

1513
01:15:52.809 --> 01:15:55.725
- As you get tired. you lose
your legs.

1514
01:15:55.768 --> 01:15:59.250
you lose your shot. a
lot of things go south.

1515
01:15:59.293 --> 01:16:00.425
- [Announcer] Les Hunter takes
his shot.

1516
01:16:00.468 --> 01:16:01.687
it rolls around and goes off.

1517
01:16:01.731 --> 01:16:04.168
And George Wilson grabs
it for the Bearcats.

1518
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:08.389
- At one time. one of the
guys came out and says.

1519
01:16:08.433 --> 01:16:10.827
"Chuck. I'm gassed."

1520
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:14.134
Well. coach said go out
there. keep playing.

1521
01:16:14.178 --> 01:16:16.267
- Somebody maybe needs a sub.

1522
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:18.965
but you don't wanna
tinker with that moment.

1523
01:16:19.009 --> 01:16:21.315
No substitutions. that's
what it's gonna be.

1524
01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:23.361
- [Red] The lead pass
intercepted by Ron Miller.

1525
01:16:23.404 --> 01:16:24.492
Ron Miller intercepted the pass

1526
01:16:24.536 --> 01:16:26.190
and now the Ramblers have got
it.

1527
01:16:26.233 --> 01:16:28.148
Action? You better believe it.

1528
01:16:28.192 --> 01:16:30.324
Miller shoots a 20-footer. good.

1529
01:16:30.368 --> 01:16:32.022
Good by Ron Miller.

1530
01:16:32.065 --> 01:16:33.763
- [Lucas] The final minutes of
overtime

1531
01:16:33.806 --> 01:16:35.634
felt like a tug-of-war.

1532
01:16:35.678 --> 01:16:37.636
Two teams desperate to win.

1533
01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:40.378
both on the verge of collapse.

1534
01:16:40.421 --> 01:16:42.336
They'd do anything to score.

1535
01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:45.122
Even if it meant taking a
play from the other side.

1536
01:16:45.165 --> 01:16:47.559
- [Announcer] To Cincinnati.
a long pass to Shingleton.

1537
01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:49.517
he's in the clear.

1538
01:16:49.561 --> 01:16:51.563
He ties it up. 58 to 58.

1539
01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:55.219
[lively upbeat music]

1540
01:16:55.262 --> 01:16:56.568
A minute and a half to go.

1541
01:17:00.528 --> 01:17:01.965
Egan almost loses it.

1542
01:17:02.008 --> 01:17:03.401
They'll have to jump for it.

1543
01:17:04.358 --> 01:17:07.318
Egan and Shingleton. the two
smallest men on the court.

1544
01:17:07.361 --> 01:17:08.885
will jump for it.

1545
01:17:08.928 --> 01:17:12.018
- Jack has no quit in him.

1546
01:17:12.062 --> 01:17:15.369
The fact that Shingleton
was a little taller

1547
01:17:15.413 --> 01:17:17.197
didn't make a difference.

1548
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:19.983
- [Announcer] Shingleton
is 5-10 and Egan is 5-9.

1549
01:17:20.026 --> 01:17:23.029
so Cincinnati with a
slight height advantage.

1550
01:17:24.204 --> 01:17:26.032
Because believe me. this
is a very important jump.

1551
01:17:26.076 --> 01:17:27.904
- [Ron] Jack would fight
anybody.

1552
01:17:27.947 --> 01:17:31.298
I mean. he didn't care who you
were.

1553
01:17:31.342 --> 01:17:33.474
If you had the ball.
he was gonna fight you

1554
01:17:33.518 --> 01:17:35.085
to take the ball.

1555
01:17:35.128 --> 01:17:39.089
- I don't care if the guy was
6-8. that's the way Jack is.

1556
01:17:39.132 --> 01:17:41.831
- [Red] Ball is up and
tipped back to Ron Miller.

1557
01:17:41.874 --> 01:17:44.572
He's got it. over to Jerry
Harkness.

1558
01:17:44.616 --> 01:17:47.532
- I think it was a misfiring
on Shingleton's part

1559
01:17:47.575 --> 01:17:50.883
because he was up too
soon before the ball was.

1560
01:17:50.927 --> 01:17:52.232
could be reached.

1561
01:17:52.276 --> 01:17:55.627
And Jack timed it perfectly.
luck of the Irish.

1562
01:17:56.497 --> 01:17:58.238
- [Red] Back to Egan. 1:15.

1563
01:17:58.282 --> 01:18:00.501
What would you do? 58-58.

1564
01:18:00.545 --> 01:18:02.678
Would you go for the one?

1565
01:18:02.721 --> 01:18:06.464
- I think everyone knew that the
idea was

1566
01:18:06.507 --> 01:18:10.424
to get the ball to Jerry
Harkness for the last shot.

1567
01:18:11.469 --> 01:18:13.906
- So we're gonna try to
get the ball to Jerry.

1568
01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:15.516
And he should be taking his shot

1569
01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.693
with three. four seconds left.

1570
01:18:17.736 --> 01:18:20.826
so there's a chance for
a tip in. a rebound.

1571
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:22.523
but not an opportunity for them

1572
01:18:22.567 --> 01:18:25.309
to get a rebound and go
all the way down the court.

1573
01:18:25.352 --> 01:18:26.963
How do we do it?

1574
01:18:27.006 --> 01:18:28.268
- [Red] They're gonna go for
one.

1575
01:18:28.312 --> 01:18:29.966
I don't think there's
any question about it.

1576
01:18:30.009 --> 01:18:32.316
50 seconds. 49. 48.

1577
01:18:32.359 --> 01:18:34.318
Harkness backing in. he may go.

1578
01:18:34.361 --> 01:18:35.841
now he goes back out to Egan.

1579
01:18:35.885 --> 01:18:39.105
Egan has got the ball. looking
around. over to Harkness.

1580
01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:41.804
back to Egan. 38 seconds left to
go.

1581
01:18:41.847 --> 01:18:44.589
To Rouse. back to Miller.
they're
gonna go for the one shot.

1582
01:18:44.632 --> 01:18:47.418
58-58. And this is a twist.

1583
01:18:47.461 --> 01:18:49.986
Cincinnati. the team that
always holds the ball.

1584
01:18:50.029 --> 01:18:52.075
they're seeing what it feels
like now.

1585
01:18:53.337 --> 01:18:57.080
- The team that normally held
the ball

1586
01:18:57.123 --> 01:18:59.909
did not know what to do

1587
01:18:59.952 --> 01:19:02.781
when someone held the ball
against them.

1588
01:19:02.825 --> 01:19:04.696
- [Red] Egan over To Harkness.

1589
01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.219
Harkness going inside the lane.

1590
01:19:06.263 --> 01:19:08.352
now he goes back out to Miller.

1591
01:19:08.395 --> 01:19:10.267
15 seconds. out to Egan.

1592
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:11.485
I guarantee you one thing.

1593
01:19:11.529 --> 01:19:13.400
they'll give it Harkness when
it's time.

1594
01:19:13.444 --> 01:19:16.664
- Everybody pretty much
thought it would come to me.

1595
01:19:16.708 --> 01:19:18.579
- [Red] Miller's got it. out to
Rouse.

1596
01:19:18.623 --> 01:19:21.191
Nine. eight. Harkness
has got it. here he goes.

1597
01:19:21.234 --> 01:19:22.888
- And I got the ball.

1598
01:19:22.932 --> 01:19:26.631
And he knew I was going
left. and I knew it.

1599
01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:29.068
But I didn't feel it.

1600
01:19:29.939 --> 01:19:34.204
In the corner of my
eye. I saw Hunter open.

1601
01:19:34.247 --> 01:19:36.293
And he can hit that shot.

1602
01:19:36.336 --> 01:19:37.685
- [Jack] Threw it to Les.

1603
01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:40.166
Now we're talking probably
three or four seconds.

1604
01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:41.385
- I got nervous.

1605
01:19:41.428 --> 01:19:44.127
Not because Les isn't a great
shot.

1606
01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:49.306
but I heard the ball scratch
as he took that shot.

1607
01:19:49.349 --> 01:19:51.961
He scratched it with his
fingernails.

1608
01:19:52.004 --> 01:19:53.876
- It was a good shot to take.

1609
01:19:53.919 --> 01:19:55.747
- It went off the side of the
rim

1610
01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:59.316
and then one of the second best.

1611
01:19:59.359 --> 01:20:01.840
third best moment of
my life was seeing Vic

1612
01:20:01.884 --> 01:20:04.016
push that ball back through the
basket.

1613
01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.278
- [Red] Off the rim. Rouse gets
it.

1614
01:20:05.322 --> 01:20:08.325
scores. it's over. it's over!

1615
01:20:08.368 --> 01:20:11.850
We won. we won. we won the
ballgame!

1616
01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:13.809
We won the ballgame!

1617
01:20:13.852 --> 01:20:16.115
Oh. we won. Loyola won the
ballgame!

1618
01:20:16.159 --> 01:20:20.032
Oh. we won it. we won.

1619
01:20:20.076 --> 01:20:21.947
60 to 58. 60 to 58.

1620
01:20:25.603 --> 01:20:28.998
Rouse gets it. scores.
it's over. it's over!

1621
01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:32.305
We won. we won. we won.
we won the ballgame!

1622
01:20:32.349 --> 01:20:33.785
- We won. we won.

1623
01:20:36.179 --> 01:20:39.051
- And all of a sudden.
we heard these voices.

1624
01:20:39.095 --> 01:20:41.532
marched out on Sheridan Road
yelling.

1625
01:20:41.575 --> 01:20:43.664
"We won. we won. we won!"

1626
01:20:43.708 --> 01:20:45.710
I think they went all the way to
Evanston.

1627
01:20:45.753 --> 01:20:49.714
like at midnight. oh.
so joyous and so joyful.

1628

[bright music]

1629
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:53.674
- You just have no idea the
pride

1630
01:20:53.718 --> 01:20:55.328
that I have for those guys.

1631
01:20:57.026 --> 01:21:00.029
- It was unbelievable.

1632
01:21:00.072 --> 01:21:03.597
It was good to see the starting
five

1633
01:21:03.641 --> 01:21:07.775
get the reward reward
that they had earned.

1634
01:21:09.603 --> 01:21:10.866
- [Interviewer] George. how does
it feel

1635
01:21:10.909 --> 01:21:13.216
to be a national champion of the
NCAA?

1636
01:21:13.259 --> 01:21:14.565
- It's the first time we brought
a team

1637
01:21:14.608 --> 01:21:16.132
to the tournament and we just
said.

1638
01:21:16.175 --> 01:21:18.047
"Look. we're having a poor first
half.

1639
01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:20.788
I know you can beat 'em. let's
go out and give it to 'em."

1640
01:21:20.832 --> 01:21:23.487
- [Announcer] And that is
the championship for 1963

1641
01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:26.533
and one of the most unbelievable
comebacks of all time.

1642
01:21:26.577 --> 01:21:30.798
- America was sitting witness
to this evolution of the game

1643
01:21:30.842 --> 01:21:34.715
by seven out of 10 African
Americans starting in that game.

1644
01:21:36.282 --> 01:21:38.589
- [Lucas] Loyola did
what they set out to do.

1645
01:21:38.632 --> 01:21:40.896
But their win represented so
much more.

1646
01:21:42.506 --> 01:21:43.594
The end of the tournament

1647
01:21:43.637 --> 01:21:45.813
marked the beginning of their
legacy.

1648
01:21:45.857 --> 01:21:47.554
one that shaped the sport

1649
01:21:47.598 --> 01:21:51.428
and their lives for years to
come.

Illinois

1657
01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:19.151
to ever win a division one
national title.

1658
01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:21.066
- How do you feel after
your four years at Loyola?

1659
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:22.676
- Well. I feel tremendous.

1660
01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:23.808
This is a great thing.

1661
01:22:23.851 --> 01:22:26.637
We won the championship in
basketball

1662
01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.987
and that's exactly what I
wanted.

[gentle bright music]

1664
01:22:33.818 --> 01:22:36.342

celebrated not just by Loyola.

but the entire city of Chicago.

1666
01:22:39.084 --> 01:22:42.000
So Ireland proudly paraded
their trophy around town.

1667
01:22:42.044 --> 01:22:44.220
including a barber shop across
from campus

1668
01:22:44.263 --> 01:22:47.049
where four of the Iron Five
weren't even allowed inside.

1669
01:22:50.574 --> 01:22:53.185
As for Jerry Harkness. after
graduating.

1670
01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:55.709
he had a short-lived pro career
in the ABA

1671
01:22:55.753 --> 01:22:57.276
before returning to Chicago

1672
01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.670
and finding work as a
salesman on the Northside.

1673
01:22:59.713 --> 01:23:00.932
close to campus.

1674
01:23:02.542 --> 01:23:06.024
Now. he was just a young black
man trying to build a life.

1675
01:23:06.068 --> 01:23:09.985
[gentle bright music continues]

1676

title.

1678

Then when it got time to just
move.

1679
01:23:20.082 --> 01:23:23.476
I could not get a place to stay.

1680
01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:26.305
And they came up with all kind
of excuses.

1681
01:23:27.306 --> 01:23:28.699
I was being discriminated
against.

1682
01:23:28.742 --> 01:23:30.657
there was no doubt about it.

1683
01:23:32.398 --> 01:23:35.271
- [Lucas] The story of the
'63 Ramblers made me wonder.

1684
01:23:36.185 --> 01:23:38.622
"What was really different now?

1685
01:23:38.665 --> 01:23:41.799
Did their accomplishments
change anything?"

1686
01:23:41.842 --> 01:23:44.497
The answer is complicated.

1687
01:23:44.541 --> 01:23:47.718
but their lasting effect
on basketball is clear.

1688
01:23:48.936 --> 01:23:53.289
- [Rich] The '63 team changed
the game.

1689
01:23:53.332 --> 01:23:56.422
made it faster. more
interesting.

1690

almost like a ballet.

01:24:02.602 --> 01:24:06.606
[gentle bright music continues]

1692
01:24:08.304 --> 01:24:10.915
- It was the beginning
of modern basketball.

1693
01:24:11.785 --> 01:24:14.875
- That changed the
landscape of college sports.

1694
01:24:14.919 --> 01:24:17.052
We were able to work together

1695
01:24:17.095 --> 01:24:20.055
with all this diversity
and come out a winner.

1696
01:24:20.098 --> 01:24:22.231
And then common sense would tell
us.

1697
01:24:22.274 --> 01:24:24.494
"Well. can't we do that
in society as well?"

1698
01:24:24.537 --> 01:24:27.584
[somber music]

1699
01:24:27.627 --> 01:24:32.589
[people yelling]
[dogs barking]

1700
01:24:35.505 --> 01:24:39.509
- [Jerry] One part of
America was making changes.

1701
01:24:39.552 --> 01:24:40.945
- [Reporter] Texas Western takes

1702
01:24:40.988 --> 01:24:43.643
the first major sports title
the school has ever won.

1703
01:24:43.687 --> 01:24:45.732
- And the other part was not.

1704
01:24:48.431 --> 01:24:53.175
I got involved in the Civil
Rights Movement after school.

1705
01:24:53.218 --> 01:24:56.308
We had an obligation to do
something.

1706
01:24:56.352 --> 01:25:00.225
say something about how the
situation was.

1707
01:25:03.315 --> 01:25:05.752
- [Lucas] Sports has a way
of tearing down barriers

1708
01:25:05.796 --> 01:25:07.580
faster than the rest of society.

1709
01:25:08.799 --> 01:25:12.455
And when athletes use their
platform to demand justice.

1710
01:25:12.498 --> 01:25:14.152
they can often turn their
victories

1711
01:25:14.196 --> 01:25:15.545
into something much bigger.

1712
01:25:17.851 --> 01:25:19.244
But they can't do it alone.

1713
01:25:21.507 --> 01:25:25.424
[gentle bright music]

1714
01:25:25.468 --> 01:25:28.079
[somber music]

1715
01:25:29.385 --> 01:25:31.082
- [Reporter] The world
of college basketball

1716
01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:32.736
has lost a pioneer.

1717
01:25:34.085 --> 01:25:35.565
Jerry Harkness was best known

1718
01:25:35.608 --> 01:25:38.133
for the history he made
as a Loyola Rambler.

1719
01:25:39.003 --> 01:25:40.396
Harkness would go on to work

1720
01:25:40.439 --> 01:25:42.615
for the United Way of Central
Indiana.

1721
01:25:42.659 --> 01:25:44.965
He helped start the Indiana
Black Expo

1722
01:25:45.009 --> 01:25:47.185
and he was the first black
sportscaster

1723
01:25:47.229 --> 01:25:49.013
on Indianapolis television.

1724
01:25:49.927 --> 01:25:52.277
Jerry Harkness was 81 years old.

1725
01:25:53.365 --> 01:25:55.976
[solemn music]

1726
01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.371
- During the 1963 season.

1727
01:25:59.415 --> 01:26:01.982
we see numerous stories being
told.

1728
01:26:02.026 --> 01:26:04.985
And the obvious one is
a story about a team.

1729
01:26:05.029 --> 01:26:07.292
a team with four black players.

1730
01:26:07.336 --> 01:26:10.382
And they play well and they win.

1731
01:26:11.296 --> 01:26:14.908
And the story doesn't stop.

1732
01:26:14.952 --> 01:26:17.694
Because the story's not
just about basketball.

1733
01:26:17.737 --> 01:26:20.784
This story is about the
worth of an athlete.

1734
01:26:20.827 --> 01:26:22.612
the worth of a black man.

1735
01:26:22.655 --> 01:26:25.354
their place in society
and what they can demand.

1736
01:26:26.398 --> 01:26:27.704
- It's just a tremendous honor

1737
01:26:27.747 --> 01:26:32.143
for all the team members to be
recognized.

1738
01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:36.452
It's a chance to see the
effect that you've had

1739
01:26:36.495 --> 01:26:38.280
on some of the people that
played.

1740
01:26:38.323 --> 01:26:41.848
some of the black players
that we opened some doors for.

1741
01:26:41.892 --> 01:26:45.374
- We are extremely proud of you.

1742
01:26:45.417 --> 01:26:49.116
You represent the university

1743
01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.771
and yourselves extremely well.

1744
01:26:51.815 --> 01:26:55.035
- We try to do our best
to just imitate you guys

1745
01:26:55.079 --> 01:26:57.690
and like what you guys have
done.

1746
01:26:57.734 --> 01:27:01.738
- The best we can do is say
this is to be continued.

1747
01:27:01.781 --> 01:27:03.957
It is a work in progress.

1748
01:27:04.001 --> 01:27:07.047
It is a project that's not yet
ended.

1749
01:27:07.091 --> 01:27:08.440
To make our country one

1750
01:27:08.484 --> 01:27:10.747
that's worthy of what
these men went through.

1751
01:27:11.748 --> 01:27:12.749
- The most important thing

1752
01:27:12.792 --> 01:27:14.446
is that we keep telling the
story.

1753
01:27:14.490 --> 01:27:16.231
Looking back you have
a better understanding

1754
01:27:16.274 --> 01:27:18.842
of why we are in the situation
that we are in today.

1755
01:27:23.673 --> 01:27:26.241
[solemn music]

1756
01:27:28.199 --> 01:27:30.636
- [Lucas] One day.
hopefully long from now.

1757
01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.248
my time playing basketball
will come to an end.

1758
01:27:34.292 --> 01:27:36.338
But there will always be more
work to do.

1759
01:27:36.381 --> 01:27:38.601
more unwritten rules to break.

1760
01:27:38.644 --> 01:27:40.167
more ways to make the world
better

1761
01:27:40.211 --> 01:27:41.517
for the next generation.

1762
01:27:42.387 --> 01:27:44.520
To me. that's the inspiration I
think

1763
01:27:44.563 --> 01:27:46.783
we can all carry forward.

1764
01:27:46.826 --> 01:27:49.264
That's the legacy of the '63
Ramblers.

1765
01:27:51.048 --> 01:27:53.616
[gentle music]

1766
01:27:57.402 --> 01:28:00.579
[gentle bright music]

1767
01:28:30.479 --> 01:28:34.483
[gentle bright music continues]

1768
01:29:00.552 --> 01:29:04.556
[gentle bright music continues]

1769
01:29:30.408 --> 01:29:34.369
