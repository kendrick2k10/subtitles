00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:44.711
[bright upbeat music]

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.401
[Andrea thuds]

7
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.736
Andrea. are you okay?

8
00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.780
Yeah. I just lost a contact.

9
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.031
That must have been tough to do.

10
00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:15.742
'cause you don't wear contacts.

11
00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.703
Okay. I fell off
the couch again.

12
00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:19.621
You really should stop
sleeping at the office.

13
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.248
Well. that would mean
I would have to stop

14
00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:22.833
living at the office.

15
00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:24.918
Hey. it's five minutes
until Christmas break.

16
00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.462
You'll get to spend a whole week
at home with your family.

17
00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.673
-Did you get--
-Gifts for your hubby and kids?

18
00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:31.300
Wrapped and waiting in your car.

19
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.968
What about--

20
00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:34.136
Bonuses for the mailing room
and cleaning crews?

21
00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:35.178
All taken care of.

22
00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:36.722
[Andrea sighs]

23
00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:38.307
I just realized
I didn't get you anything.

24
00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:40.475
Yes. you did.

25
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.519
and you were generous.

26
00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.021
How generous?

27
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:45.689
Very generous.

28
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.067
Merry Christmas. Jess.

29
00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:50.360
Merry Christmas.

30
00:01:54.323 --> 00:01:56.533
Huh.

31
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.161
[Nick] Andrea. just the person
I was looking for.

32
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:00.162
Hi. Nick.

33
00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:01.538
Got a minute?

34
00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:03.040
-Not really.
-Great. come on in.

35
00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:08.086
Nick. I booked this time
off in August.

36
00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:09.379
My family's waiting for me.

37
00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.048
I'll be quick.
Take a seat.

38
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.346
First. I wanna congratulate you
on the Hedgewear campaign.

39
00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:19.431
The client is ecstatic.

40
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:22.976
and the sales on the dishes
are just off the charts.

41
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.771
They have charts for dishes.

42
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.606
Everybody's got charts.

43
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.694
So I spoke with Donna Lennon
this afternoon.

44
00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:34.738
She's the. uh. chairman

45
00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:37.157
for the Green. Clean
and Pristine Cleaning Supplies.

46
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.659
That's Will's campaign.

47
00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.328
Very good observation.
very astute.

48
00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:45.374
But see. he's spending
Christmas in The Bahamas.

49
00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:46.792
And?

50
00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.168
And Layla Brown.
their spokesperson.

51
00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.670
is here in Boston.

52
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.879
She was supposed
to shoot a commercial

53
00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.214
for us this afternoon.

54
00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:54.049
but she missed her flight
and was late.

55
00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.093
And she's leaving for Italy
on the evening of the 26th.

56
00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:57.552
So we're gonna have
to move the shoot.

57
00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:59.304
Let me guess...

58
00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.516
to tomorrow. Christmas Day.

59
00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:05.227
It'll just be a couple hours.
first thing in the morning.

60
00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:06.937
It's Christmas.

61
00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:08.230
Christmas morning. yeah.

62
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.690
And it'll be super easy.
super quick.

63
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.108
Will already hired the crew.

64
00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:13.026
we got Paul Selmon
as the director.

65
00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.570
who you already know.
which is. which is great.

66
00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.783
All we need from you
is just to show up on set.

67
00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:21.785
You know. keep Layla happy
for a couple hours

68
00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.245
while she says some lines.

69
00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:25.122
then you get to go
to your family.

70
00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:26.915
You know I wouldn't ask you
if it wasn't important. right?

71
00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.167
Okay. I might. But it is.

72
00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.002
And what an ideal way
to end your year.

73
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.796
You know we're
considering promotions.

74
00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.589
Three hours and I'm out.

75
00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.842
Three. four or five. tops.

76
00:03:36.842 --> 00:03:37.884
Yes. then you're out.

77
00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.347
What are you still doing here?

78
00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:43.723
Get outta here.
enjoy your time off.

79
00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:44.891
What time off?

80
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:45.976
[scoffs]

81
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.313
[pensive music]

82
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.944
[bright upbeat music]

83
00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:59.114
[phone vibrating]

84
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.118
-Hey.
-[Andrea] Hey.

85
00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:04.703
-You headed home?
-Yes.

86
00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:05.996
I'm just gonna stop at the store

87
00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:07.998
and pick up some groceries.

88
00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:09.583
[Andrea] I thought maybe we
could make breakfast tomorrow.

89
00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.585
-Oh.
-What?

90
00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.128
[John] Uh. nothing.

91
00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:16.214
Nothing. just the thought
of you making breakfast.

92
00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.757
Always an adventure.

93
00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:20.385
[Andrea] Hey.
I've been improving.

94
00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.971
Uh. I don't know if making toast

95
00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.473
without setting off
the smoke alarm

96
00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:26.475
counts as improving. but...

97
00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:28.059
I can see your point.

98
00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.228
How did the. uh.
the Hedgewear campaign go?

99
00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.731
Great. I guess sales
were off the charts.

100
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.274
They have charts?

101
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.318
[Andrea chuckles]
That's what I said.

102
00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:40.238
So listen. uh. tomorrow
I might have to--

103
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.949
Wait. wait. wait. wait.
I know this one.

104
00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.242
Go in to work.

105
00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.619
[Andrea] It's just--

106
00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:46.870
For a couple hours
in the morning.

107
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.747
-[Andrea] And I--
-You're sorry.

108
00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:50.081
[John] I know the drill. Andy.

109
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.792
John.

110
00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:56.004
No. but listen. I should get
some presents wrapped

111
00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.839
before the kids get home.

112
00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.341
[Andrea] Save a couple for me.
I'll be home soon.

113
00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:02.344
I love you.

114
00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:03.887
I love you too.

115
00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.096
[phone beeps]

116
00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:08.850
[calm music]

117
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.150
[bell ringing]

118
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.486
[Santa] Merry Christmas!

119
00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:21.029
Merry Christmas!

120
00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.782
Merry Christmas!

121
00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:27.160
Oh.

122
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.787
Well. thank you. Andrea.

123
00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.121
Wait. how do you know my name?

124
00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:31.498
Well. I'm Santa.

125
00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.583
I know everyone's name.

126
00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.377
I know when they're
sleeping or awake.

127
00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:37.337
I know if they've been bad
or good.

128
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.713
or somewhere in between.

129
00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.757
Well. thank you. Thomas.

130
00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.222
He knows my name.
he knows my name.

131
00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.349
[Thomas] I told you
I was being a good boy.

132
00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.393
I also know there's going
to be a shooting star

133
00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:52.936
on Christmas night.

134
00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:55.480
There's special magic
in a shooting star.

135
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.607
but a shooting star
on Christmas?

136
00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:00.110
Well. the magic
is off the charts.

137
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.320
I guess everyone really
does have charts.

138
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.906
Don't be afraid to make a wish.
Andrea.

139
00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:08.326
You might get
what your heart desires.

140
00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:10.203
If only were that easy.

141
00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.580
I don't really believe
in wishes.

142
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.040
Oh. but they believe in you.

143
00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:16.960
[bright upbeat music]

144
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.753
-Merry Christmas!
-[bell ringing]

145
00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:20.797
Merry Christmas. Timothy.

146
00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.591
Merry Christmas!

147
00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:24.467
Merry Christmas!

148
00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:25.927
Hey. guys!

149
00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:27.888
-[Lexi] Hey. mom.
-[Matt] Hey. mom.

150
00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.681
Hey. hey.

151
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.850
Ooh. look at that hat. nice.

152
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.727
-Thanks.
-I'm digging it.

153
00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.896
Hey. Matt.
Ryder's mom called me.

154
00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:37.606
she said that you weren't
gonna sleep over

155
00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:38.982
with the usual crew?

156
00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:42.235
Yeah. I wasn't
really feeling it.

157
00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.613
Well. I guess you have
the entire Christmas break

158
00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:46.114
to hang out with your friends.

159
00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.325
Mom. I'm practicing
a new Tiptop dance.

160
00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:49.868
you should do it with me.

161
00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.578
Mother-daughter stuff
gets a ton of likes.

162
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.705
I guess I could use
a little exercise in my life.

163
00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.332
Yeah. try something new.

164
00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:57.500
Get out of those boring
work clothes.

165
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.878
Hey. your dad and I
used to dance.

166
00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:01.379
She ain't lying.

167
00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.840
Your dad had some
pretty sweet moves.

168
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.592
-I used to break down like that.
-[all laughing]

169
00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.010
Uh-uh. uh-uh. uh-uh.

170
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.219
Look at that. check the hand.

171
00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.846
Dad. they've turned sour.

172
00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:12.182
Hey. hey. don't be jealous.

173
00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:13.683
Don't be jealous.
I can teach you.

174
00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:15.018
As soon as I catch my breath.

175
00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.478
[all laugh]

176
00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.730
So tomorrow. what time
are you leaving?

177
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.315
Oh. not too early.

178
00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:21.983
Wait. you're not gonna
be here for Christmas?

179
00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.568
Just a couple hours
in the morning.

180
00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:27.072
Yes! I'm now 20 bucks richer.
Pay up. Matt.

181
00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:30.116
Wait. did you have a bet whether
I had to work on Christmas?

182
00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.868
-Of course not.
-We had to bet

183
00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.496
whether you'd work in
the morning or the afternoon.

184
00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:35.955
[Matt] The money's in my room.

185
00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.415
Then what are we doing
in the kitchen?

186
00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.504
Come on.

187
00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:43.588
[Matt sighs]

188
00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.173
[John chuckles]

189
00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.217
[Andrea] Well. Lexi is quite
the loan shark.

190
00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.593
She gets that from you.

191
00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.053
Hey. hey. hey.
I love her to death.

192
00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.221
but I just adopted her.

193
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.098
She's got your genes.

194
00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:54.557
[Andrea chuckles]

195
00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.894
So tomorrow.

196
00:07:57.894 --> 00:07:59.729
Look. Nick gave me no choice.

197
00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.649
Apparently the talent
got stuck in Boston.

198
00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.943
It's not even my account.
but I have to be a--

199
00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:07.070
Be a team player. I know.

200
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.073
Just remember we could use
you here on the home team too.

201
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:13.952
[John tutting]

202
00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:15.745
-[Andrea] Sorry.
-No cookies before dinner.

203
00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:17.163
They look good.

204
00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.749
[calm music]

205
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:22.794
[keyboard clattering]

206
00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:39.060
[calm music]

207
00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:46.067
[John sniffling]

208
00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.039
[calm music]

209
00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:21.227
-[people chattering]
-[ball thumping]

210
00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.229
What the heck is that?

211
00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:29.611
[calm music]

212
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.406
[dramatic music]

213
00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.408
[Andrea thuds]

214
00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:36.993
Merry Christmas.

215
00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.873
Merry Christmas!

216
00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:43.333
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

217
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.335
Hey. don't get too excited.
all right?

218
00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:47.337
You know. you kids used
to wake us up

219
00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:50.090
at 4:30 to open presents.

220
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.966
Yeah. sorry about that.

221
00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.510
[Andrea chuckles]

222
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.012
Uh. speaking of rude awakenings.

223
00:09:56.012 --> 00:10:00.308
who are those boys out there
with Ryder using our hoop?

224
00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:03.269
That's Carter and Gavin.
you remember them.

225
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.396
We were on the town league
when we were in middle school.

226
00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:06.815
Right.

227
00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:08.983
Why aren't you out there
playing with them?

228
00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:12.278
It's too early.
and it's too cold.

229
00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:15.615
and basketball really
isn't my thing anymore.

230
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:16.741
[Andrea] Huh.

231
00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:23.456
Well. are Christmas pancakes
still your thing?

232
00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:26.042
Because I still have some time
before I go to work.

233
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.377
No.

234
00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:30.171
Hello? The great pancake
debacle of 2019.

235
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:31.339
The fire department showed up.

236
00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:32.966
It wasn't that bad.

237
00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:38.304
No. it most definitely
was that bad.

238
00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:39.889
It's a nice thought mom.

239
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:43.309
but I still have
nightmares about that.

240
00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:46.229
It took me six days to get
the smell of burnt rubber

241
00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:47.355
out of my hair.

242
00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.109
Trust me.

243
00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:57.073
-[smoke alarm beeping]
-[all coughing]

244
00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:03.913
Maybe we just have
some cereal.

245
00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:08.459
[upbeat music]

246
00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:11.087
[ball thumping]

247
00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.513
Merry Christmas. boys.

248
00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.015
[Ryder] Good morning. Mrs. B.

249
00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.017
[upbeat music]

250
00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.810
Hey. Larry. Merry Christmas!

251
00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.104
[Larry sighs]
That's one opinion.

252
00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:29.772
-[Ryder] Look out!
-Oh!

253
00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:31.858
Sorry.

254
00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:33.234
Don't worry about it.

255
00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.116
[upbeat music]

256
00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:47.123
[Layla] Being an influencer
can be a messy job.

257
00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.292
There's only one product
that I rely on

258
00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:52.045
to keep my whites.
their brightest;

259
00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.464
Glean. Cream and Stream.

260
00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:55.798
Cut!

261
00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.302
Really great work. Layla.

262
00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:00.553
[Layla chuckles]

263
00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.180
Absolutely fantastic.

264
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.765
Just one little note;

265
00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:08.478
The product is Green.
Clean and Pristine.

266
00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.605
Green. Clean and Pristine.

267
00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.106
What did I say?

268
00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:15.485
Glean. cream and stream.

269
00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:16.861
Again.

270
00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:18.279
Okay. well you know what?

271
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.948
That's actually
really hard to say.

272
00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:22.242
Maybe they should change
the name.

273
00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.077
Love that idea.

274
00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:25.912
but this product has been
on the market for five years.

275
00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.498
So I think it's maybe
a little bit late for that.

276
00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:29.499
Let's try one more.

277
00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:35.964
Remember. Green. Clean
and Pristine.

278
00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:43.721
How's it going?

279
00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.141
Absolutely fantastic.

280
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.643
If we were shooting a commercial

281
00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:51.479
for a product called
glean. cream and stream.

282
00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.065
or clean. serene and steam.

283
00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:56.859
or clean. green and. uh...

284
00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:58.861
[imitating Layla]
What's this called?

285
00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.447
[normal voice] Are we set?

286
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.621
And action!

287
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.623
Hi. I'm Layla Brown

288
00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:14.377
and I wanna tell you all about
one of my favorite products;

289
00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.004
Mean. Clean...

290
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.798
That's not right. is it?

291
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:21.718
Cut!

292
00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:26.264
[phone vibrating]

293
00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:28.433
Hey. Nick.

294
00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:29.517
How's it going?

295
00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:30.977
Good. good.

296
00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:34.230
[Paul] Again. you've been
saying mean.

297
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.315
Well. you know what?

298
00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.358
Maybe you should do it then.

299
00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:38.484
What's that?

300
00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:40.153
Nothing. just rehearsals.

301
00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:44.949
[Paul] There's no mean.
it's Green. Clean and Pristine!

302
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.993
[Paul] There. I did it.

303
00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:49.495
For what. Christmas
with my in-laws?

304
00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:51.164
You know what?

305
00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.374
You're mean and green.
like the Grinch.

306
00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:54.792
I quit.

307
00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:55.793
[Paul]
So now she gets it right.

308
00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:57.128
Andrea.

309
00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:58.838
Setting up the next shot.
gotta go. Bye.

310
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.339
Layla. wait.

311
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.885
Who are you?

312
00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:06.137
I'm Andrea Bowman
from the agency.

313
00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:08.181
Oh. so you hired that guy.

314
00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:10.058
Technically the agency did.

315
00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:12.560
Well. technically
I'm not working with him.

316
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.228
Find someone else
to sell your soap.

317
00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:16.856
Actually it's detergent.

318
00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:19.108
Right. it doesn't matter.

319
00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:20.485
Paul. wait.

320
00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:22.236
Did you hire that girl?

321
00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:23.654
Technically. the age--

322
00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:25.656
She's like the nightmare
before Christmas.

323
00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:27.366
No. it is Christmas.

324
00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:29.660
She's like the nightmare
on Christmas.

325
00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.704
Sorry. my wife is waiting
for me at home.

326
00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:33.331
-I've gotta go.
-Well. can we just--

327
00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.041
Sorry. I'm out of here.

328
00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:39.462
[pensive music]

329
00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:50.932
[siren wailing]

330
00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:53.935
[blinker clicking]

331
00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:01.109
[car alert ringing]

332
00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:10.451
Ma'am. this is
a residential area.

333
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:12.537
Do you know how fast
you were driving?

334
00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:14.705
Apparently not fast enough.

335
00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:16.290
License and registration.

336
00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.508
[Andrea sighs]

337
00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:27.009
[door closes]

338
00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:41.566
[Andrea sighs]

339
00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:42.942
What happened to you?

340
00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.819
Layla Brown.

341
00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:45.862
The influencer?

342
00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:48.531
You know about her?

343
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:51.576
Yeah. Our daughter
has a slight obsession.

344
00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:54.078
Ugh. I wish I had Lexi with me

345
00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:56.205
to advise me
how to relate to her.

346
00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.543
Anyway. this smells delicious.

347
00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:02.587
[calm music]

348
00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:04.964
What can I do?

349
00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:09.135
Well. how about you cook off
some stress.

350
00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.721
Take it out on some potatoes?

351
00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:14.932
Yes. I think I can
successfully accomplish that.

352
00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.602
[calm music]

353
00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:19.937
How's work been for you?

354
00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:22.023
-Eh.
-Eh?

355
00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:25.902
Yeah. I'm a bit behind actually.

356
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.988
I'm home all week.

357
00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:32.783
if you wanna go in and
catch up a couple of days.

358
00:16:32.783 --> 00:16:35.286
Well. it's definitely an idea.

359
00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:37.496
but I was kind of hoping

360
00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:41.250
we could spend some time
together as a family.

361
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.669
I haven't seen much of you
since you took the new job.

362
00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:46.547
I know. this year
has just flown by.

363
00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:50.509
Well. it's been like
molasses to me.

364
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:54.055
Look. you know I support
your career. Andy. always have.

365
00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:58.100
I just. I just didn't realize
you'd be working this much.

366
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.061
That makes two of us.

367
00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:03.397
It's been... lonely.

368
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.901
For me too.

369
00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:12.865
Sometimes when I'm in the office
late at night

370
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:16.994
and I know you and the kids
are already sound asleep.

371
00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:21.624
I close my eyes and remember
the first day we met.

372
00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:23.125
Why?

373
00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:25.544
Because that day we bumped
into each other

374
00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:26.796
at the restaurant.

375
00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:29.257
Literally bumped
into each other.

376
00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:33.427
Hey. I replaced that sadly
wasted glass of champagne.

377
00:17:33.427 --> 00:17:35.763
You did. you did.

378
00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:37.181
Chateau Seine.

379
00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:39.684
Which is now one of your faves.
by the way.

380
00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:43.729
Yeah. this is true.

381
00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.273
What's also true

382
00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:48.192
is when we met there was
just something about you

383
00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:50.236
that felt like home for me.

384
00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:53.406
and I knew I would never
feel alone ever again.

385
00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:57.535
That's how you get
through those times. huh?

386
00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:58.661
Yep.

387
00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:05.835
John. I don't thank you enough
for changing my life

388
00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:11.132
and for accepting Lexi
so openly and lovingly.

389
00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:14.385
I am so grateful for all
the memories we've made.

390
00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:16.762
I sure miss
making memories with you.

391
00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:17.847
Me too.

392
00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.851
Taking time away from you
and the kids

393
00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:23.603
was never what I wanted.

394
00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:26.939
We both agreed I needed
to take the job. right?

395
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:28.858
Right.

396
00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.735
We wanted to keep this house.

397
00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.862
we had to pay for the repairs
after the basement flooded.

398
00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:36.741
and save for college. and. yeah.

399
00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:37.992
What is it?

400
00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:42.288
[oven beeping]

401
00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:43.831
Oh. the rolls.

402
00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:46.584
Oh. geez.

403
00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:50.171
Oh. no.

404
00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:54.967
[tray clatters]

405
00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:57.053
[John sighs]

406
00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:01.098
They're just extra crispy.

407
00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:02.141
There you go.

408
00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:05.519
Extra crispy. extra burnt.

409
00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:08.773
[Andrea chuckles]

[enchanting music]

411
00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:23.371
Are you ready?

412
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:24.455
Let's dance.

413
00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:27.667
All right. let's do this.

414
00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.418
Teach me how to Tiptop.

415
00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:31.545
Tiptop's the app mom.
not the dance.

416
00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:32.713
I knew that.

417
00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:34.548
Just follow my lead.

418
00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:35.633
[upbeat music]

419
00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:37.968
Ready? March in place.

422
00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:47.895
And dribble.

423
00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.398
And we're driving a car.

424
00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.692

Mom! Are you okay?

427
00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:00.199
Ugh. yeah.

428
00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:04.245
I don't really use
that ankle anyway.

429
00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.579
Maybe you're past
your Tiptop prime.

430
00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:07.039
[phone ringing]

431
00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.250
Oh. sorry.

432
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.710
I have to take this.

433
00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:15.214
[phone ringing]

434
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:18.384
Nick. hi.
I was just about to call you.

435
00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:20.052
You were? Oh. that's good.

436
00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:22.096
'Cause I'd hate to think
that you were not gonna tell me

437
00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:24.390
that our shoot completely
fell apart today.

438
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.975
putting thousands of dollars

439
00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:27.727
and our relationship
with our client at risk.

440
00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.895
Yeah. see the thing is--

441
00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:32.815
Actually. Andrea.
let me tell you the thing.

442
00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:35.067
The thing is I spent
the entire day on the phone

443
00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.902
with Paul. Layla and our client

444
00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:38.904
and I've convinced them to
give us another shot tomorrow.

445
00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.656
Tomorrow?

446
00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:43.617
Nick. I wasted my entire
Christmas morning on this.

447
00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:45.828
I need to spend time
with my family.

448
00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:48.581
And I spent my entire
Christmas morning on this.

449
00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:50.583
I need you to be there
first thing in the morning.

450
00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:52.209
before anyone else.

451
00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:53.836
I want you to babysit.
make sure everyone's happy

452
00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:55.421
so that we get this shot.

453
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:56.380
Then you can spend
all the time that you want

454
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.174
with your family.

455
00:20:58.174 --> 00:20:59.091
[Nick's mother-in-law]
Is he still on the phone?

456
00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:00.342
[woman] Nick!

457
00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.343
You got it?

458
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.304
Got it.

459
00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:04.680
And Merry Christmas.

460

[pensive music]

461
00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.642
Yeah. very. merry.

Grandma Millie.

463
00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:15.441
How long have you been
standing there?

464
00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:18.068
Since about. "Here's the thing."

465
00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:19.445
So you heard?

466
00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:21.906
Your boss
is frustrated with you.

467
00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:23.866
There's a good chance
your husband may be too.

468
00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:26.535
and if I had to guess.

469
00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:28.871
you don't know how
you got into this pickle.

470
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:30.289
Right as always.

471
00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:32.374
Oh. I'm so glad to see you.

472
00:21:32.374 --> 00:21:33.417
Me too.

473
00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:38.297
Did my son not tell you
that I was on my way over?

474
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:40.883
No. he didn't.

475
00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:43.511
Come on in. the kids
will be thrilled to see you.

476
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:46.180
Look who's here.

477

this hilarious video. come on.

Oh. I have to tell you
this joke I heard.

481

A joke? Oh. good.
A video and a joke. I'm ready.

482
00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.650
You're gonna die.
it is so funny.

her makeup as this cat comes in.

you've been telling me
all about.

How'd you know?

491
00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:15.626
I watched you break your old one

492
00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:17.211
the last time I visited.
remember?

493
00:22:17.211 --> 00:22:19.755

was concrete.

You shouldn't have.
you really shouldn't have.

Oh. a backup mixer.

Huh. it's pink.

You know. this bathrobe
isn't so bad.

504

So. you know how the shoot
didn't go so well today?

505
00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:25.738
You have to work again tomorrow?

506
00:23:25.738 --> 00:23:26.906
How did you know?

507
00:23:28.866 --> 00:23:30.993
I'm used to it. I guess.

Well. I'll do it.

00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:38.959
I might reverse stress eat

511

and then hit the real food
after.

512
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:44.548
Okay.

00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:47.509

you're home

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.915
You didn't know
the basement floor was concrete.

725
00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:22.417
Is she okay?

726
00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:24.044
I think she's a little tired.

727
00:33:27.631 --> 00:33:29.549
Let's open our presents
from mom.

728
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:32.177
Oh. actually I left them
at work.

729
00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:34.179
No. you didn't.
They're right here.

730
00:33:34.179 --> 00:33:36.097
Oh. well...

731
00:33:37.724 --> 00:33:38.850
You shouldn't have.

732
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.977
I know. I really shouldn't have.

733
00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:48.818
Symptoms of depression.

734
00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.988
Am I depressed?

735
00:33:51.988 --> 00:33:53.448
No. that can't be it.

736
00:33:55.659 --> 00:33:57.410
Stroke.

737
00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:00.747
No.

738
00:34:00.747 --> 00:34:02.374
No. I'm fine.

739
00:34:02.374 --> 00:34:04.668
I got the okay from the doctor
two weeks ago.

740
00:34:04.668 --> 00:34:06.503
Who are you talking to?

741
00:34:06.503 --> 00:34:08.588
Oh. me. myself and I.

742
00:34:08.588 --> 00:34:10.423
Oh. really. huh?

743
00:34:10.423 --> 00:34:11.925
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

744
00:34:11.925 --> 00:34:14.761
It's not necessarily
a bad thing.

745
00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:18.682
Maybe it is.

746
00:34:18.682 --> 00:34:21.601
Well. I have ruled out
depression and a stroke.

747
00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:23.019
What?

748
00:34:24.354 --> 00:34:26.231
Nothing.

749
00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:27.691
-Look. look.
-It's nothing.

750
00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:30.568
Andy. you know I'm here

751
00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:32.195
if you wanna talk about it.
right?

752
00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:36.241
You wouldn't understand.

753
00:34:38.285 --> 00:34:40.495
All right. You done?

754
00:34:40.495 --> 00:34:42.080
I'll get it. again.

755
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.540
No. I got it.

756
00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.417
I know. I'm.
I'm eyeing some leftovers.

757
00:34:45.417 --> 00:34:46.876
it'll make a good dessert

758
00:34:46.876 --> 00:34:49.129
and I'll dispose
of the evidence.

759
00:34:50.171 --> 00:34:51.840
[sighs] Okay.

760
00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:55.176
Goodnight.

761
00:34:56.803 --> 00:34:59.014
I'll be there in a little.

762
00:34:59.723 --> 00:35:00.849
[John] Hm-hmm.

763
00:35:02.517 --> 00:35:05.979

-[bag crunches]
-[lid shuts]

765
00:35:21.286 --> 00:35:24.164
I wish I hadn't had that day
to do over again.

[suspenseful music]

768
00:35:44.517 --> 00:35:45.935
Santa!

-[people chattering]
-[ball thumping]

770
00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:53.693
No.

771
00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:55.236
Not again.

772
00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:57.238
Ugh.

773
00:36:00.742 --> 00:36:01.826
[Andrea sighs]

774
00:36:06.665 --> 00:36:07.832
[ball thumps]

775
00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:08.833
Oh!

776
00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.210
[Andrea thuds]

777
00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.629
Must be Christmas.

778
00:36:12.629 --> 00:36:16.257
[bright upbeat music]

779
00:36:16.257 --> 00:36:19.135
-Good morning.
-Sorry. no time to talk.

780
00:36:19.135 --> 00:36:20.220
I gotta find Santa.

781
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.429

[door opens]

783
00:36:24.933 --> 00:36:26.309
I have no idea.

784
00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:30.980
[bright upbeat music]

785
00:36:35.694 --> 00:36:37.946
Morning. Larry!

786
00:36:37.946 --> 00:36:39.322
[Larry sighs]
That's one opinion.

787
00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:42.325
Look out!

788
00:36:42.325 --> 00:36:44.577
-Sorry.
-I'll let this one slide.

789
00:36:46.913 --> 00:36:48.707
[Santa] Merry Christmas.

790
00:36:48.707 --> 00:36:50.291
Oh. Merry Christmas.

791
00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:52.877
-Well. thank you. Timothy.
-[bell ringing]

792
00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:54.587
Merry Christmas.

793
00:36:54.587 --> 00:36:56.089
[bell ringing]

794
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:57.340
Merry Christmas!

795
00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.466
Hey. you!

796
00:36:58.466 --> 00:37:00.593
Merry-- Ooh. Merry Christmas.

797
00:37:00.593 --> 00:37:02.929
Don't try and change
the subject.

798
00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:04.723
What did you do to me?

799
00:37:04.723 --> 00:37:06.307
What do you mean?

800
00:37:06.307 --> 00:37:09.102
I mean. I keep living
this day over and over

801
00:37:09.102 --> 00:37:10.937
and it's not a really good day.

802
00:37:10.937 --> 00:37:13.273
I didn't do anything. Andrea.

803
00:37:13.273 --> 00:37:15.775
You made your own wish
upon a star.

804
00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:16.776
But I...

805
00:37:19.988 --> 00:37:21.364
But I unwished it last night.

806
00:37:21.364 --> 00:37:24.701
[Santa laughs]
You can't unwish a wish.

807
00:37:24.701 --> 00:37:26.661
There are rules to this
sort of thing. you know.

808
00:37:26.661 --> 00:37:28.621
-Rules?
-Well. of course.

809
00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:30.874
I mean. why would
anyone warn you

810
00:37:30.874 --> 00:37:34.627
to be careful what you wish for
if there weren't any rules?

811
00:37:34.627 --> 00:37:37.297
Why. you could just change
your wish willy nilly.

812
00:37:37.297 --> 00:37:38.882
And how on earth
would that work?

813
00:37:38.882 --> 00:37:40.258
I don't know.

814
00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:41.843
I don't know
how any of this works.

815
00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:43.845
You made a wish. Andrea.

816
00:37:43.845 --> 00:37:45.680
What did you want?

817
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.140
I wished...

818
00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:49.434
[Andrea sighs]

819
00:37:49.434 --> 00:37:51.019
I wished I could do
the day over again.

820
00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:53.062
I know what you said. Andrea.

821
00:37:53.062 --> 00:37:54.731
But what did you want?

822
00:37:55.732 --> 00:37:57.901
I don't know.

823
00:37:57.901 --> 00:38:00.612
I guess everything just seemed
so messed up. I...

824
00:38:00.612 --> 00:38:03.031
I wanted a chance
to get things right.

825
00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:05.700
Then there's your answer.

826
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.410
Your wish comes true

827
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.372
when you finally get
what you really want.

828
00:38:11.372 --> 00:38:13.124
-How do I do that?
-[Santa laughs]

829
00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:16.085
When it happens you'll know.

830
00:38:17.253 --> 00:38:18.588
Merry Christmas.

831
00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:29.224
[phone rings]

832
00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:32.393
-Hey.
-Andrea. where are you?

833
00:38:32.393 --> 00:38:33.686
You're supposed to be
at the shoot.

834
00:38:33.686 --> 00:38:35.605
Sorry. I had to talk to Santa.

835
00:38:35.605 --> 00:38:38.107
Santa? Is that
some kind of joke?

836
00:38:38.107 --> 00:38:39.317
I wish.

837
00:38:40.735 --> 00:38:42.570
I didn't mean that.

838
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.072
Are you okay?

839
00:38:44.072 --> 00:38:47.450
No. not until I get
what I really want.

840
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.035
Yeah. that makes two of us.

841
00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:51.120
[Nick's Mother-in-law]
Is he still on the phone?

842
00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.163
[Woman] Nick.

843
00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.040
Heading your way. pumpkin.

844
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.959
Nick. I gotta go.

845
00:38:55.959 --> 00:38:58.002
Same time today tomorrow?

846
00:39:03.925 --> 00:39:06.135
[bright upbeat music]

847
00:39:06.135 --> 00:39:07.887
[siren wailing]

848
00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:18.398
Do you know why
I pulled you over?

849
00:39:18.398 --> 00:39:20.149
Hijacking.

850
00:39:20.149 --> 00:39:22.110
No?

851
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.486
Taillight's out.

852
00:39:23.987 --> 00:39:25.280
No.

853
00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.156
Ah. I'm flummoxed.

854
00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:33.162
Maybe a ticket for 150 bucks
will make you stop

855
00:39:33.162 --> 00:39:36.124
the next time you feel
the need for speed.

856
00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:39.294
Maybe.

857
00:39:39.294 --> 00:39:41.754
Tomorrow none of this
will matter.

858
00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:43.548
Okay to go?

859
00:39:43.548 --> 00:39:45.967
I have to get to sleep
so I can reset this time loop.

860
00:39:54.517 --> 00:39:57.520
[bright upbeat music]

861
00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:04.319
Oh. you're home early.

862
00:40:04.319 --> 00:40:06.613
Yeah. I have to get to sleep.

863
00:40:06.613 --> 00:40:09.824
Sleep?
Andrea. it's 11:00 AM.

864
00:40:09.824 --> 00:40:11.910
Good point. I should
probably take something

865
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:13.411
to help me fall asleep.

866
00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:19.834
Can I ask you a question?

867
00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:21.586
Sure.

868
00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:24.422
You remember a couple years ago
when I made pancakes?

869
00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:27.300
Ah. you mean when you tried
to make pancakes

870
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.052
but instead made
a small house fire?

871
00:40:29.052 --> 00:40:30.136
Yeah. I kind of remember that.

872
00:40:30.136 --> 00:40:31.721
Well. tell me if I'm wrong.

873
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:33.598
When we were outside.
barefoot in the snow.

874
00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:35.767
watching the fire
department inside.

875
00:40:35.767 --> 00:40:37.352
I thought I saw you smiling.

876
00:40:37.352 --> 00:40:38.436
Yeah.

877
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:40.897
Yeah. yeah. I was smiling.

878
00:40:40.897 --> 00:40:43.816
'Cause of you
trying to make something.

879
00:40:43.816 --> 00:40:46.486
you had no idea how to make.

880
00:40:46.486 --> 00:40:49.238
and no business trying
to make probably.

881
00:40:49.238 --> 00:40:51.699
all because you knew
it was my favorite.

882
00:40:52.784 --> 00:40:55.286
It was so perfect. so.

883
00:40:55.828 --> 00:40:57.622
so. you.

884
00:40:57.622 --> 00:40:58.957
I can work with that.

There it is.

00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:36.536
Merry Christmas!

-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

892
00:41:38.538 --> 00:41:40.248
Well. don't get too excited.

893
00:41:40.248 --> 00:41:43.459
I know what will make
everyone excited.

894
00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:49.507
Excited is not a synonym
for frightened.

895
00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:51.801
Remember the great
pancake debacle of 2019?

896
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:53.302
The fire department showed up.

897
00:41:53.302 --> 00:41:55.972
I know. but if I really
think about it.

898
00:41:55.972 --> 00:41:59.392
what I really wanna do is
make pancakes for my family.

899
00:41:59.392 --> 00:42:00.977
So that's what I'm gonna do.

We'll try again tomorrow.

906
00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:27.628

[Paul] Cut!

915
00:42:45.188 --> 00:42:47.273

Green. Clean...

921
00:43:13.091 --> 00:43:14.383
Is that a T?

922
00:43:17.136 --> 00:43:20.014
What is going on?

923
00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:22.350
Oh. my God. yes. mom.
Shimmy clap.

924
00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:23.851

Green. Clean...

927
00:43:33.736 --> 00:43:35.905
This is creepy.

928
00:43:35.905 --> 00:43:37.657
[Andrea sighs]

929
00:43:37.657 --> 00:43:40.535

931
00:43:48.209 --> 00:43:49.335

[calm music]

934
00:44:11.065 --> 00:44:12.400
Merry Christmas.

935
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.405
So what time are you
going in today?

936
00:44:17.405 --> 00:44:19.448
It doesn't matter.

937
00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:21.659
It doesn't matter?

938
00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:25.037
It's all the same.
day after day.

939
00:44:25.037 --> 00:44:26.664
Nothing ever changes.

940
00:44:28.583 --> 00:44:31.627
We get it.
school's the same way.

941
00:44:33.462 --> 00:44:35.548
So you're not going in today?

942
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.096
When's the last time
we built a snowman?

943
00:44:45.141 --> 00:44:48.436
[bright upbeat music]

944
00:44:48.436 --> 00:44:50.563

-[John] Do it. do it. go for it.

945
00:44:50.563 --> 00:44:52.398
Go for it. There we go.

946
00:44:52.398 --> 00:44:53.774
[all] Yay!

947
00:44:53.774 --> 00:44:56.527
[all laughing]

948
00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.070
Hi. Larry.

949
00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:03.451
Hi.

950
00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:07.038
Hey. so. uh. so what
do we call him. Frosty?

951
00:45:07.038 --> 00:45:08.414
Lex Luthor.

952
00:45:08.414 --> 00:45:11.167
-Beyoncé.
-Beyoncé.

953
00:45:11.167 --> 00:45:14.420
Um. how about Dennis?

954
00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.422
Dennis? Oh. all right.

955
00:45:16.422 --> 00:45:18.883
Well. uh.
nice to meet you. Dennis.

956
00:45:18.883 --> 00:45:20.092
Don't try any funny business.
buddy.

957
00:45:20.092 --> 00:45:21.260
We got cameras out here.

958
00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.512
[all laugh]

959
00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:30.978
[pensive music]

960
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.565
You wanna join them?

961
00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:36.734
No. it's cold outside.

962
00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:38.194
I'm going inside.

963
00:45:43.866 --> 00:45:45.743
All righty. Dennis. Let's see.

964
00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:46.827
Yeah. that's a good one.

965
00:45:46.827 --> 00:45:48.704
Hey. is everything okay?

966
00:45:48.704 --> 00:45:50.248
It's fine.

967
00:45:50.248 --> 00:45:51.415
Are you sure?

968
00:45:52.959 --> 00:45:54.877
I didn't make
the basketball team.

969
00:45:54.877 --> 00:45:56.379
When did this happen?

970
00:45:56.379 --> 00:45:58.172
A couple weeks ago.

971
00:45:58.172 --> 00:46:00.383
Well. why didn't you tell me?

972
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:07.390
Grandma knew.

973
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:11.686
I wanted to tell you.
but you were at work.

974
00:46:11.686 --> 00:46:13.896
Matt. I know I'm not here
all the time.

975
00:46:13.896 --> 00:46:16.357
but no matter where I am.

976
00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:20.361
whatever's going on with you
or your sister. or your dad.

977
00:46:20.361 --> 00:46:22.697
that always comes first.

978
00:46:22.697 --> 00:46:25.658
Sometimes it doesn't feel
that way.

979
00:46:25.658 --> 00:46:27.743
I'm sorry.

980
00:46:27.743 --> 00:46:29.578
I love you so much.

981
00:46:29.578 --> 00:46:31.706
and I really do care
what's happening in your life.

982
00:46:31.706 --> 00:46:36.252
And...
as far as basketball goes.

983
00:46:36.252 --> 00:46:39.839
if you ever wanna practice.
I'll be there.

984
00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:41.340
I remember
when we used to practice

985
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:44.760
before you got that new job.
I miss that.

986
00:46:48.514 --> 00:46:51.392
How about we pick up right
where we left off now?

987
00:46:52.101 --> 00:46:53.561
You're on.

988
00:46:53.561 --> 00:46:56.188
-[both laughing]
-[bright upbeat music]

989
00:46:57.565 --> 00:46:58.607
-[Andrea] Woo!
-[all chuckling]

990
00:46:58.607 --> 00:47:00.276
[phone ringing]

991
00:47:00.276 --> 00:47:01.861
I gotta take this.

992
00:47:03.154 --> 00:47:04.155
Hello?

993
00:47:04.155 --> 00:47:05.364
How's it going?

994
00:47:05.364 --> 00:47:06.824
[Andrea] Oh. great!

995
00:47:06.824 --> 00:47:09.660
We were down by six.
then Matt scored a three.

996
00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.287
[Andrea] He's so good.

997
00:47:11.287 --> 00:47:12.121
I just think he gets
a little nervous.

998
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:13.998
Matt? Who's Matt?

999
00:47:13.998 --> 00:47:16.334
-My son.
-Where are you?

1000
00:47:16.334 --> 00:47:18.252
At home.
we're playing basketball.

1001
00:47:18.252 --> 00:47:19.712
You're supposed to be
at the shoot.

1002
00:47:19.712 --> 00:47:21.339
[Andrea]
That is a true statement.

1003
00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:23.007
And then I thought
let's just see what happens

1004
00:47:23.007 --> 00:47:25.468
if I don't go in.
as an experiment.

1005
00:47:25.468 --> 00:47:28.804
Andrea. I don't think
you understand what's going on.

1006
00:47:28.804 --> 00:47:30.014
[Andrea] Nice!

1007
00:47:30.014 --> 00:47:31.474
Nick. I gotta go.

1008
00:47:31.474 --> 00:47:33.642
I'm sure we're gonna talk
again tomorrow.

1009
00:47:33.642 --> 00:47:35.353
Just spend time
with your family.

1010
00:47:35.353 --> 00:47:37.396
they miss you that's all.

1011
00:47:37.396 --> 00:47:39.690
[Nick's Mother-in-law]
Is he still on the phone?

1012
00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:40.858
[Woman] Nick!

1013
00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:43.235
Be right there. sugar plum!

1014
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.238
Andrea. you need to--

1015
00:47:49.325 --> 00:47:50.409
Andrea?

1016
00:47:53.746 --> 00:47:56.749
[line ringing]

1017
00:47:56.749 --> 00:47:58.584
[Operator] The number
you've dialed is not--

1018

[Andrea laughing]

1021
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.931
Did you see his face
when you dunked on him?

1022
00:48:11.931 --> 00:48:14.308
He was like. what?

1023
00:48:14.308 --> 00:48:15.518
You set me up with the rebound.

1024
00:48:15.518 --> 00:48:16.769
Team effort.

1025
00:48:18.396 --> 00:48:20.398
You think if I practice enough

1026
00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:21.690
I can make the summer team?

1027
00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:24.068
I do.
You've always loved basketball.

1028
00:48:24.068 --> 00:48:25.528
I'd hate to see you give it up.

1029
00:48:25.528 --> 00:48:26.737
Yeah. me too.

1030
00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:27.738
Thanks. Mom.

1031
00:48:31.242 --> 00:48:32.785
It was nice
to spend time together.

1032
00:48:32.785 --> 00:48:34.829
Yeah. I know.

1033
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:37.164
[calm music]

1034
00:48:45.464 --> 00:48:48.551
Hey. Lex. what you watching?

1035
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:50.261
Just this influencer.

1036
00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:51.720
I'm not sure she's your thing.

1037
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.973
Well. I'm up to find out
if you are.

1038
00:48:53.973 --> 00:48:55.474
[Grandma Millie] Hello?

1039
00:48:55.474 --> 00:48:57.685
It's Grandma.

1040
00:48:57.685 --> 00:48:59.687
-[Millie laughs]
-[Lexi] Grandma Millie!

1041
00:48:59.687 --> 00:49:01.230
[Andrea] Oh. Lexi.

1042
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:04.066
give Grandma Millie
some breathing room.

1043
00:49:04.066 --> 00:49:05.651
It's all right.

1044
00:49:05.651 --> 00:49:07.528
I live for these moments.

1045
00:49:09.113 --> 00:49:10.739
Well. where's that
grandson of mine?

1046
00:49:10.739 --> 00:49:12.199
Oh. he's upstairs.

1047
00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:13.993
We were playing basketball
all morning.

1048
00:49:13.993 --> 00:49:16.036
Oh. I'm so glad
he's getting back out there

1049
00:49:16.036 --> 00:49:17.496
after he didn't make the team.

1050
00:49:17.496 --> 00:49:19.039
I just found out about that.

1051
00:49:19.039 --> 00:49:20.958
That's why he's been
extra charming lately.

1052
00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:22.751
It's all he could talk about
for a week.

1053
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:25.629
Grandma. I have to show you

1054
00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:27.298
the video that just dropped.
come on.

1055
00:49:28.466 --> 00:49:29.675
It's so funny.

1056
00:49:29.675 --> 00:49:31.635
[Grandma Millie] Yay!

1057
00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:35.222
Okay y'all. now this part
is very tricky.

1058
00:49:35.222 --> 00:49:37.850
You have to be very careful
around your lip line.

1059
00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:40.019
Hey. that's Layla Brown.

1060
00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:41.604
You know who Layla Brown is?

1061
00:49:41.604 --> 00:49:42.771
Actually I do.

1062
00:49:44.607 --> 00:49:46.025
[cat growls]

1063
00:49:46.025 --> 00:49:49.236
[Lexi laughs]

1064
00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:52.781
I guess my cat. Rico. decided
to make an appearance.

1065
00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:54.825
I am so sorry. you guys.

1066
00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:57.953
Anyways. like I said.
I love this stuff

1067
00:49:57.953 --> 00:50:00.206
because it's cruelty free.
paraben free.

1068
00:50:00.206 --> 00:50:02.791
sulfate free. phthalate free.
acrylic free.

1069
00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:06.086
and free of any synthetic
colors and fragrances.

1070
00:50:06.086 --> 00:50:07.546
How does she do that?

1071
00:50:07.546 --> 00:50:09.507
Who. Layla?
She's a natural on camera.

1072
00:50:09.507 --> 00:50:11.008
Do you wanna do that?

1073
00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:12.760
What she does?

1074
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.470
Oh. no way. I don't wanna be
in front of the camera.

1075
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:15.888
I wouldn't mind learning more

1076
00:50:15.888 --> 00:50:17.640
about what goes on
behind the scenes though.

1077
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.475
Mom used to take me to work
with her. remember. mom?

1078
00:50:19.475 --> 00:50:21.644
I had the best time
on set with you.

1079
00:50:21.644 --> 00:50:23.187
Of course I remember.

1080
00:50:25.564 --> 00:50:28.359
Lex. do you wanna
meet Layla Brown?

1081
00:50:28.359 --> 00:50:29.985
Are you serious?

1082
00:50:29.985 --> 00:50:32.029
Yeah. I was supposed
to work with her today.

1083
00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:33.822
Mom what?
Why didn't you tell me?

1084
00:50:33.822 --> 00:50:35.366
I didn't...

1085
00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:37.076
You didn't even go in?

1086
00:50:37.076 --> 00:50:38.702
There goes my chance.

1087
00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:41.205
[phone ringing]

1088
00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:43.541
Actually. you'd be surprised

1089
00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:45.376
how often these chances
come around.

1090
00:50:48.212 --> 00:50:49.922
Hello?

1091
00:50:49.922 --> 00:50:51.298
[Nick] Andrea. finally.
Where have you been?

1092
00:50:51.298 --> 00:50:53.175
Spending time with my family.

1093
00:50:53.175 --> 00:50:55.803
Listen. I don't know if this
is some sort of power play.

1094
00:50:55.803 --> 00:50:56.887
No.

1095
00:50:56.887 --> 00:50:58.305
Why. would that have worked?

1096
00:50:58.305 --> 00:51:00.474
The set was a complete disaster
without you.

1097
00:51:00.474 --> 00:51:03.310
Let me guess. Layla couldn't
remember her lines.

1098
00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:04.687
had a blow up. walked off.

1099
00:51:04.687 --> 00:51:06.397
Yeah. but--

1100
00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:07.940
You convinced everyone
to come back tomorrow?

1101
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.608
Well. yeah. and I--

1102
00:51:09.608 --> 00:51:11.026
And you want me there
first thing to babysit

1103
00:51:11.026 --> 00:51:12.736
and make sure
everything goes okay?

1104
00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:15.030
-Yes.
-Don't worry about it. Nick.

1105
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.199
I think I know exactly
what to do.

1106
00:51:17.199 --> 00:51:19.076
And spend time with your family.

1107
00:51:19.076 --> 00:51:20.286
What?

1108
00:51:20.286 --> 00:51:21.787
Cue Mother-in-law.

1109
00:51:21.787 --> 00:51:23.455
[Nick's Mother-in-law]
Is he on the phone again?

1110
00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:24.832
[Woman] Nick?

1111
00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:32.131
[upbeat music]

1112
00:51:38.512 --> 00:51:40.264
[Andrea] I had fun today.

1113
00:51:40.264 --> 00:51:42.016
I did too.

1114
00:51:42.016 --> 00:51:44.685
I haven't seen Matt that excited
about basketball in months.

1115
00:51:44.685 --> 00:51:47.187
and Lexi building that snowman.

1116
00:51:47.187 --> 00:51:48.731
[John chuckles]

1117
00:51:48.731 --> 00:51:51.025
They reminded me
of that first Christmas

1118
00:51:51.025 --> 00:51:53.611
that we spent together before
we were married. remember?

1119
00:51:53.611 --> 00:51:55.154
Hmm.

1120
00:51:55.154 --> 00:51:56.614
I had promised Lexi that
we would build a snowman.

1121
00:51:56.614 --> 00:51:58.073
Hm-hmm.

1122
00:51:58.073 --> 00:51:59.742
But we didn't get
any snow all winter.

1123
00:51:59.742 --> 00:52:01.619
She was so disappointed.

1124
00:52:01.619 --> 00:52:05.497
All she wanted was to build
a snowman to welcome Santa.

1125
00:52:05.497 --> 00:52:06.999
Right.

1126
00:52:06.999 --> 00:52:09.293
So you found that old
snow cone machine

1127
00:52:09.293 --> 00:52:10.836
and you stayed up...

1128
00:52:10.836 --> 00:52:13.339
I remember you stayed up
all night. grinding ice.

1129
00:52:13.339 --> 00:52:15.174
Oh. boy.

1130
00:52:15.174 --> 00:52:16.967
I still don't think I have
all the feeling in my fingers.

1131
00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:18.469
[John laughs]

1132
00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:21.513
Oh. we spent
the next morning outside

1133
00:52:21.513 --> 00:52:24.224
building the world's
saddest snowman.

1134
00:52:24.224 --> 00:52:27.311
Which she insisted was
the world's greatest snowman.

1135
00:52:27.311 --> 00:52:29.521
[both laugh]

1136
00:52:31.065 --> 00:52:34.318
You know.
I think it was that day

1137
00:52:34.318 --> 00:52:37.321
I decided I wanted to be
a part of this family.

1138
00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:39.990
I'd never seen someone
so in love with their kid.

1139
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.201
And so in love with you.

1140
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:44.495
[enchanting music]

1141
00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:47.748
Hey. let's just get food
on the table. huh?

1142
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.007
Ah. a new drill!

1143
00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:58.717
How'd you know?

1144
00:52:58.717 --> 00:53:00.219
[Grandma Millie] Well.
I saw you break the old one

1145
00:53:00.219 --> 00:53:01.929
the last time I visited.

1146
00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:04.306
[John] Well. I didn't know
the basement floor was concrete.

1147
00:53:04.306 --> 00:53:06.225
Let's open our presents
from mom.

1148
00:53:07.643 --> 00:53:09.478
No. no. no. no.

1149
00:53:10.229 --> 00:53:11.647
No. no. no.

1150
00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:14.858
You're not gonna like it.

1151
00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:16.110
How do you know that?

1152
00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:17.528
It's a bathrobe.

1153
00:53:17.528 --> 00:53:19.738
You're right.
I'm not gonna like it.

1154
00:53:19.738 --> 00:53:21.657
If there's one thing
I've learned over and over

1155
00:53:21.657 --> 00:53:24.993
from the past day. days.
doesn't matter.

1156
00:53:24.993 --> 00:53:30.040
is that I am not paying
enough attention and listening.

1157
00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.876
So. I'm just gonna ask you
straight up.

1158
00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:34.461
What do you want for Christmas?

1159
00:53:34.461 --> 00:53:36.547
Uh. Andy?

1160
00:53:36.547 --> 00:53:39.675
Don't you think
it's a bit late for that?

1161
00:53:39.675 --> 00:53:41.760
Well. sure. today.

1162
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.263
But there's next
Christmas tomorrow.

1163
00:53:44.263 --> 00:53:47.141
Uh. so. what do you want.

1164
00:53:47.141 --> 00:53:52.479
Andrea. you know
that a Christmas gift

1165
00:53:52.479 --> 00:53:54.690
comes from the heart.

1166
00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:57.568
It's not the gift that matters.

1167
00:53:57.568 --> 00:54:00.154
it's the sentiment
behind the gift

1168
00:54:00.154 --> 00:54:06.034
that shows that you know
and love that person. right?

1169
00:54:06.034 --> 00:54:10.914
[Andrea] And you choose the gift
based on what they like.

1170
00:54:12.541 --> 00:54:14.418
Of course.

1171
00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:18.505
Well. I'm just afraid
I'll mess things up even more.

1172
00:54:18.505 --> 00:54:23.135
Hey. hey. how about
we grab some cookies

1173
00:54:23.135 --> 00:54:24.261
and hot chocolates?

1174
00:54:24.261 --> 00:54:26.013
-Yes.
-[John] Yep.

1175
00:54:26.013 --> 00:54:28.390
[Grandma Millie] Yes. I'll come
help. We'll leave you some.

1176
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:30.893
[pensive music]

1177
00:54:32.978 --> 00:54:35.647
[fire crackling]

1178
00:54:39.735 --> 00:54:41.820
[Grandma Millie] Hey.

1179
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:44.865
I thought I'd check in
on you before I head home.

1180
00:54:47.493 --> 00:54:49.411
What are you working on?

1181
00:54:49.411 --> 00:54:50.537
Christmas gift list.

1182
00:54:50.537 --> 00:54:51.788
[Millie chuckles]

1183
00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.499
Better late than never.

1184
00:54:55.501 --> 00:54:59.129
Lexi. likes Tiptop
and Layla Brown.

1185
00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:04.176
Well. "likes" really
isn't a strong enough word.

1186
00:55:04.176 --> 00:55:07.679
Matt likes basketball.
dislikes jellyfish.

1187
00:55:07.679 --> 00:55:09.848
Well. now we're
getting somewhere.

1188
00:55:09.848 --> 00:55:11.558
-Grandma Millie...
-Oh. maybe I should--

1189
00:55:11.558 --> 00:55:14.770
...likes red wine.
wealthy bachelors. fast cars.

1190
00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:16.688
True. Dislikes...

1191
00:55:19.274 --> 00:55:20.400
Me?

1192
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.447
Oh. I don't dislike you.

1193
00:55:25.447 --> 00:55:27.950
Well. that's a relief because--

1194
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:30.410
If I'm being honest...

1195
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:35.374
perhaps I dislike the way
you've been overworking yourself

1196
00:55:35.374 --> 00:55:37.292
the past year.

1197
00:55:37.292 --> 00:55:42.005
I took the promotion for them.
for all of us.

1198
00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:45.884
so that we wouldn't have to
worry about money for college.

1199
00:55:45.884 --> 00:55:49.137
and the house. and.
and everything else.

1200
00:55:50.764 --> 00:55:53.058
And what good is the money.
Andrea.

1201
00:55:53.058 --> 00:55:56.937
If you're not here
to take care of them with it?

1202
00:55:56.937 --> 00:56:01.858
You have a beautiful family
who love you so much.

1203
00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:05.612
I'm doing my best.

1204
00:56:05.612 --> 00:56:06.822
Are you?

1205
00:56:07.573 --> 00:56:09.950
[fire crackling]

1206
00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:12.703
John.

1207
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:23.046
I know your intention

1208
00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:26.216
is to show the people
you love the most.

1209
00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:31.263
that work is not your
top priority. they are.

1210
00:56:31.263 --> 00:56:34.600
So I'm not the one
you need to convince.

1211
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.394
[pensive music]

1212
00:56:41.607 --> 00:56:44.192
Put me down for the red wine.

1213

[lips smack]

1214
00:56:47.696 --> 00:56:50.157
And save the bachelor
for New Years.

1215
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.329

00:57:18.894 --> 00:57:20.854
Andrea. what are you doing?

1220
00:57:20.854 --> 00:57:22.522
I'm making pancakes.

1221
00:57:22.522 --> 00:57:24.316
Pancakes?

1222
00:57:24.316 --> 00:57:27.235
Uh. hello? The great pancake
debacle of 2019. remember?

1223
00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:28.987
The fire department showed up.

1224
00:57:28.987 --> 00:57:29.988
Today is different.

1225
00:57:29.988 --> 00:57:31.531
Why is that?

1226
00:57:31.531 --> 00:57:33.116
Because I stayed up
all night practicing

1227
00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:34.993
to get it down perfectly.

1228
00:57:34.993 --> 00:57:36.745
If you stayed up all night.
why are you so chipper today?

1229
00:57:36.745 --> 00:57:37.954
I have no idea.

1230
00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:39.373
Uh. Andrea.

1231
00:57:39.373 --> 00:57:41.208
[Andrea tutting]

1232
00:57:41.208 --> 00:57:42.793
-I got this.
-[John] Okay.

1233
00:57:42.793 --> 00:57:45.712
[calm music]

1234
00:57:47.047 --> 00:57:48.382
Get the fire extinguisher ready.

1235
00:57:48.382 --> 00:57:49.841
I heard that.

1236
00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:54.805
Dig in.

1237
00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:57.140
Wow. impressive!

1238
00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.475
Oh. my God.

1239
00:57:58.475 --> 00:57:59.643
Wow.

1240
00:57:59.643 --> 00:58:01.687
[John] That is amazing.

1241
00:58:01.687 --> 00:58:03.772
-[all laughing]
-[John] Easy. easy son.

1242
00:58:03.772 --> 00:58:04.856
[Lexi] Oh. my God.

1243
00:58:04.856 --> 00:58:05.982
[Matt] They're good.

1244
00:58:05.982 --> 00:58:07.109
These are good. good.

1245
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:08.568
[Lexi] These are so good. Mom.

1246
00:58:08.568 --> 00:58:10.445
[John] They're awesome.
Look at this.

1247
00:58:10.445 --> 00:58:14.950
John. I'm gonna need to steal
one of your gingerbread men.

1248
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:16.827
It's for a good cause.

1249
00:58:16.827 --> 00:58:17.869
Okay.

1250
00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:21.498
[Andrea] Come on. Matt.
Lexi. eat up.

1251
00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:23.291
I have big plans for us today.

1252
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:24.918
What kind of plans?

1253
00:58:24.918 --> 00:58:27.045
You'll see.

1254
00:58:27.045 --> 00:58:31.383
-[bright upbeat music]
-[ball thumping]

1255
00:58:31.383 --> 00:58:34.136
[Andrea] Larry. do you have
plans for Christmas dinner?

1256
00:58:34.136 --> 00:58:36.096
No plans. Why?

1257
00:58:36.096 --> 00:58:38.557
Join us. there's someone
I want you to meet.

1258
00:58:38.557 --> 00:58:39.891
Me?

1259
00:58:39.891 --> 00:58:41.268
Yes. you.

1260
00:58:41.268 --> 00:58:43.687
-See you at six?
-[chuckles]

1261
00:58:43.687 --> 00:58:44.896
Yeah. six.

1262
00:58:45.605 --> 00:58:47.357
Wow.

1263
00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:48.942
[bright upbeat music]

1264
00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:51.069
We've lived next door
to that man for 10 years

1265
00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:53.155
and I've never seen him
smile before.

1266
00:58:53.155 --> 00:58:54.281
First time
for everything.

1267
00:58:54.281 --> 00:58:56.283
Mom. what are we doing here?

1268
00:58:56.283 --> 00:58:57.492
You're here to play basketball.

1269
00:58:57.492 --> 00:58:59.411
What?
With those guys?

1270
00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:00.912
They're not even here for me.

1271
00:59:00.912 --> 00:59:02.789
they're just here
because they feel bad.

1272
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:05.292
Trust me. not only
are they your friends.

1273
00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:06.668
they've been here all morning

1274
00:59:06.668 --> 00:59:08.128
wanting to play basketball
with you.

1275
00:59:08.128 --> 00:59:10.297
[Matt sighs]

1276
00:59:10.297 --> 00:59:12.632
-Hold this.
-Okay. but why?

1277
00:59:12.632 --> 00:59:14.676
[Ryder] Look out!
Sorry.

1278
00:59:14.676 --> 00:59:16.219
Totally cool.

1279
00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:17.763
Mrs. B. can we have
our ball back?

1280
00:59:17.763 --> 00:59:19.639
I'll make you a deal Ryder.

1281
00:59:19.639 --> 00:59:22.684
If I miss this shot. then
I'll give you your ball back.

1282
00:59:22.684 --> 00:59:25.687
If I make it.
I get to play with you.

1283
00:59:27.105 --> 00:59:28.732
All right. you're on.

1284
00:59:32.319 --> 00:59:33.361
No way!

1285
00:59:33.361 --> 00:59:34.780
Way!

1286
00:59:38.283 --> 00:59:40.160
Wait. aren't you gonna play or?

1287
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.328
Oh. I have to get to work.

1288
00:59:42.329 --> 00:59:43.789
Matt can play for me.

1289
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:44.790
Mattie!

1290
00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:46.750
[Boy] Mattie. finally!

1291
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:48.293
[Boy] Where have you been?
We missed you out here.

1292
00:59:48.293 --> 00:59:49.878
[Matt] Spending Christmas time.

1293
00:59:49.878 --> 00:59:51.129
[Matt] It's cold outside.
you know?

1294
00:59:51.129 --> 00:59:53.423
-Alright. okay.
-Cool. man.

1295
00:59:53.423 --> 00:59:55.133
[Matt] Two v two?

1296
00:59:55.133 --> 00:59:58.303
[Layla] Being an influencer
can be a messy job.

1297
00:59:58.303 --> 01:00:00.639
-[Layla] There's only one
product that I rely on...
-Is that who I think it is?

1298
01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:05.393
to keep my whites extra bright.
Clean. Cream and Stream.

1299
01:00:05.393 --> 01:00:08.188
[Paul] Cut!

1300
01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:09.689
[Layla sighs]

1301
01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.608
[Andrea] Paul. can I talk
to you for a minute?

1302
01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:14.027
Just a second. I have to explain
to our spokesperson

1303
01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:15.320
what our product is called.

1304
01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.906
Let's take five. it's important.

1305
01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:20.909
Okay.

1306
01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:23.703
Everybody. take five.

1307
01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:33.296
Paul. this is my daughter. Lexi.

1308
01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:34.965
[Paul] Nice to meet you.

1309
01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:37.968
Lexi is a huge fan
of Layla Brown's.

1310
01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.594
Actually. she has a video

1311
01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:41.596
that I think you're
gonna find interesting.

1312
01:00:41.596 --> 01:00:43.098
Lexi. will you pull
up that video

1313
01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:44.307
you're gonna show
Grandma Millie later?

1314
01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.851
How did you know about that?

1315
01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:47.227
I have my ways.

1316
01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.652
[Layla] Anyways. like I said.

1317
01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.238
I love this stuff
because it's cruelty free.

1318
01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:01.575
paraben free. sulfate free.
phthalate free. acrylic free.

1319
01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:04.494
and free of any synthetic
colors and fragrances.

1320
01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:06.538
How did she do that?

1321
01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:09.833
She's been stumbling
over simple lines all morning.

1322
01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:13.086
I don't know. but I think Lexi
can help us figure it out.

1323
01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:15.046
What do you say. Lex?

1324
01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:17.674
Mom. it's Layla Brown.

1325
01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.092
I don't know what to say to her.

1326
01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:21.887
Just be yourself.

1327
01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:27.392
You are smart. you have
an infectious personality.

1328
01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:28.810
So just be you.

1329
01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:31.855
-Really?
-Yeah.

1330
01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.773
I am so glad you're mine.

1331
01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:38.737
Here goes.

1332
01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:40.739
Wait. Andrea.
do you have any idea

1333
01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.240
how much we're paying
for this shoot?

1334
01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.034
I do.

1335
01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:47.078
I also know we have absolutely
no idea how to fix this.

1336
01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:49.748
So let's just see what happens.

1337
01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:52.626
[enchanting music]

1338
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.130
Well. what are they...

1339
01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:58.423
Just wait.

1340
01:01:59.507 --> 01:02:02.344
[enchanting music]

1341
01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:05.430
Well. that was unexpected.

1342
01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:08.558
What are they doing?

1343
01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.813
What did you just do?

1344
01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:15.857
Nothing. we just talked.

1345
01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:17.108
You made her cry.

1346
01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:18.902
Not me. you did.

1347
01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:20.403
Not on purpose. but you did.

1348
01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.155
Wait. what?

1349
01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.074
Layla's whole career has
just been her in her bedroom

1350
01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.951
with her cat and her camera.

1351
01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:27.744
This is her first big shoot.

1352
01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:30.664
It's Christmas. she's all
alone in an unfamiliar city.

1353
01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:32.540
she misses her cat

1354
01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.834
and you've got all these
lights and cameras and people.

1355
01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.211
She's overwhelmed.

1356
01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:38.672
What should we do?

1357
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.551
Being an influencer
can be a messy job.

1358
01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:45.887
There's only one product
that I rely on

1359
01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:51.559
to keep my whites extra bright.
Green. Clean and Pristine.

1360
01:02:51.559 --> 01:02:55.021
No mess. no stress
and no harsh chemicals.

1361
01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:59.442
Try Green. Clean and Pristine.
the better detergent.

1362
01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:02.112
And cut!

1363
01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.447
[Paul laughing]

1364
01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:05.490
That's a wrap!

1365
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:07.826
[Paul chuckling]

1366
01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:09.285
That was a miracle.

1367
01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:11.287
No. that was my daughter.

1368
01:03:11.997 --> 01:03:13.707
[both laughing]

1369
01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:14.833
Lexi.

1370
01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:18.837
[Layla laughing]

1371
01:03:18.837 --> 01:03:20.964
[Lexi] That was so cool.

1372
01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:22.007
Can I get a picture with you?

1373
01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:23.842
Yes. of course.

1374
01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:25.552
[phone vibrating]

1375
01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:26.845
Hey. Nick.

1376
01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:28.596
How's it going?

1377
01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:31.224
You know. for the first time
I think we got it right.

1378
01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:32.892
Well. Merry Christmas.

1379
01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:33.893
[Andrea] Merry Christmas.

1380
01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:35.478
Mom.

1381
01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:38.565
[bright upbeat music]

1382
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.777
Well. it was so good
to meet you. Lexi.

1383
01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:44.320
You too.

1384
01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.780
I can't wait to see how
the commercial comes out.

1385
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.324
Uh. I'm thinking good.
thanks to you.

1386
01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:49.909
Before she goes.

1387
01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:51.119
Lex. why don't you show her
the Tiptop dance

1388
01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:52.704
-you're working on?
-Mom?

1389
01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:53.788
I'll do it with you.

1390
01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:54.998
But you don't know it.

1391
01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:56.041
I'll follow along.

1392
01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:57.667
I'd love to see it.

1393
01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.003
Okay.

1394
01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.925
-You ready?
-Hm-hmm.

1395
01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:07.927
[upbeat music]

1396
01:04:07.927 --> 01:04:10.680
Oh. my God. I love this one.

1397
01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:14.059
How do you know this?

1398
01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:15.560
I have my secrets.

1399
01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.145
[bright upbeat music]

1400
01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:18.480
You're better than us.

1401
01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.026
-Come on. ladies.
-[all laughing]

1402
01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:26.237
[bright upbeat music]

1403
01:04:29.282 --> 01:04:30.992
I can't believe I met
Layla Brown.

1404
01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:33.328
But when did you learn
that dance?

1405
01:04:33.328 --> 01:04:36.164
Well. technically today.

1406
01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:37.832
[siren wailing]

1407
01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:39.584
Mom?

1408
01:04:39.584 --> 01:04:41.336
No worries. I got this.

1409
01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:45.715
I'm so sorry. officer.

1410
01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:48.134
I guess I wasn't
paying attention.

1411
01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:51.012
See. I just brought my
daughter with me to work

1412
01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:54.349
and she solved this huge
problem we were having.

1413
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:57.102
I guess I was just
so proud of her.

1414
01:04:57.102 --> 01:05:00.063
I couldn't wait to get her home
to tell her dad about it.

1415
01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:01.397
I have a daughter as well.

1416
01:05:04.692 --> 01:05:07.779
Her name is Cindy. she's two.

1417
01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:10.490
I can see the resemblance.

1418
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:13.910
Okay. I. I guess I can let
this one slide.

1419
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.537
but just this one time.

1420
01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.122
Thank you so much. officer.

1421
01:05:17.122 --> 01:05:18.289
One sec.

1422
01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:24.671
I just wanna thank you
for working so hard for us

1423
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:26.798
to keep us safe
on Christmas day.

1424
01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:29.175
A little token
of our appreciation.

[calm music]

1429
01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:40.687
Wow. that was pretty smooth.

1430
01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:43.606
Well. I've had
a little practice.

1431
01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:45.608
Dad. you're not gonna
believe what happened.

1432
01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:46.734
What?

1433
01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.572
Ooh.

1434
01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:53.741
Layla Brown is our spokesperson
for Green. Clean and Pristine.

1435
01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:56.828
I thought today was a good
bring your daughter to work day.

1436
01:05:56.828 --> 01:06:00.081
She was so cool. and she told me
I have flawless skin.

1437
01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:03.251
Oh wow. the height
of human achievement. Hmm.

1438
01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:06.171
I have to go call Madison.
she's gonna flip.

1439
01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:09.549
Oh. I love her.

1440
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:11.551
And. wow. look at you.

1441
01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:14.679
Someone's racking up
the mom points today.

1442
01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:16.264
First Matt. and now this?

1443
01:06:16.264 --> 01:06:17.932
What did Matt say?

1444
01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:18.850
Well. he said you helped him
get back in the game

1445
01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:20.685
with his friends.

1446
01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:23.271
I think he was embarrassed
after he didn't make the team.

1447
01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:25.273
He thought they wouldn't wanna
hang out with him anymore.

1448
01:06:25.273 --> 01:06:27.483
Well. they played basketball
all morning.

1449
01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.444
Oh. that's wonderful.

1450
01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:34.199
So. you wanna help me
get dinner ready?

1451
01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:36.075
Actually. I have
some last second

1452
01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:38.119
Christmas shopping to do.

1453
01:06:38.119 --> 01:06:41.039
If I run out now then I can
be back in time to help.

1454
01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:43.833
You haven't finished
buying Christmas gifts yet?

1455
01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.502
It depends. how much
do you want a new mixer?

1456
01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:47.962
Oh.

1457
01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:49.380
I'll be back
in a couple of hours.

1458
01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.840
Yeah. okay.

1459
01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.133
And we need another
place setting for dinner.

1460
01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:53.259
I invited Larry.

1461
01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:54.677
Larry. our neighbor?

1462
01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:55.929
Larry. our new friend.

1463
01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:57.805
Oh. all right.

1464
01:06:57.805 --> 01:06:59.766
Well Grandma Millie
is coming at 3:30.

1465
01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:02.060
3:28. I'll see you soon.

1466
01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:06.606
Man. she's good.

1467
01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:09.025
Nick. I totally get it.

1468
01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.777
When your in-laws
disrespect you.

1469
01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:13.905
it can make the holidays
really difficult.

1470
01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:15.698
Yay or nay?

1471
01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.325
Um. it's not your color.

1472
01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:19.160
Why don't you go
with the brown dress?

1473
01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.870
And use the white scarf
as a belt.

1474
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.622
Um. where were we?

1475
01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:25.959
Right. so you didn't just
marry your wife.

1476
01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:28.753
you married her entire family.

1477
01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:31.339
But you just have to set
some boundaries.

1478
01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:34.008
Let them know that they
are guests in your house

1479
01:07:34.008 --> 01:07:36.010
and they can't walk
all over you.

1480
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.721
You deserve respect.

1481
01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:40.890
But at the end of the day.

1482
01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:44.102
reminding them that
they're important to you

1483
01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:45.770
and that their time matters

1484
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:49.399
will give you everything
that you need in return.

1485
01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.566
What do you think?

1486
01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:51.609
It's a winner.

1487
01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:56.781
Look. I know you're right.
but they scare me.

1488
01:07:56.781 --> 01:07:58.783
I mean. what are they gonna do
when I stand up to them?

1489
01:07:58.783 --> 01:08:02.662
The question is. Nick. what
are you gonna do if you don't?

1490
01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:04.372
No more excuses.

1491
01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:07.959
Stand up to them.
but with a big bear hug.

1492
01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:13.256
Red dress with silver
or gold shoes?

1493
01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:14.465
Why don't you go with both?

1494
01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:15.967
I'm giving you a raise.

1495
01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:17.885
[Nick's Mother-in-law]
Is he still on the phone?

1496
01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:19.470
[Woman] Nick?

1497
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:22.682
I am on the phone.
but I'll be right out.

1498
01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:29.105
I'll try them on first.

1499
01:08:30.815 --> 01:08:32.567
[Santa] Well. thank you. Susan.

1500
01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:33.818
Merry Christmas.

1501
01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:36.446
-[bell ringing]
-Merry Christmas.

1502
01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.656
Merry Christmas.

1503
01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:40.033
Merry Christmas.

1504
01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:42.327
Merry Christmas.

1505
01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:43.703
It's shaping up to be.

1506
01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:46.456
Oh. your wish
is coming true then?

1507
01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:47.498
I'd say so.

1508
01:08:47.498 --> 01:08:49.334
My kids think I'm a hero.

1509
01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:50.835
I think I found a gift
my mother-in-law

1510
01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:52.295
will actually like.

1511
01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:54.464
and I'm about to win
my husband back.

1512
01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:55.673
Really?

1513
01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:58.176
Yes. really. Why?

1514
01:08:58.176 --> 01:08:59.344
Why do you say it like that?

1515
01:08:59.344 --> 01:09:00.845
Oh. I'm just happy to hear

1516
01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:03.139
that your wish is coming true.
Andrea.

1517
01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:04.807
Is there something
you're not telling me?

1518
01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:06.184
[hesitates] No.

1519
01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:08.478
Oh. did I say Merry Christmas?

1520
01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:09.729
Yes.

1521
01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:12.190
Then no. that's everything.

1522
01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:16.652
[bell ringing]

1523
01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.198
Merry Christmas.

1524
01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:21.991
Merry Christmas.

1525
01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:24.660
-Merry Christmas.
-[twinkle]

1526
01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.037
[Grandma Millie chuckling] Oh!

1527
01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.872
Oh. Millie!

1528
01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:30.458
Oh. Merry Christmas.

1529
01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:32.919
You look so sharp.
I love that on you.

1530
01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:35.588
Thank you. the kids
will be excited to see you.

1531
01:09:35.588 --> 01:09:36.672
Yes.

1532
01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:38.591
And later on...

1533
01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:40.843
[doorbell rings]

1534
01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:42.053
Hi.

1535
01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:45.807
Hubba. hubba.

1536
01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.143
Hello.

1537
01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:53.439
How did you know?

1538
01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:54.982
Lucky guess.

1539
01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:56.067
Thank you.

1540
01:09:57.568 --> 01:10:00.029
Oh. nice. yeah.

1541
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.865
Awesome!

1542
01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:03.950
Thanks. Mom.

1543
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.201
You're welcome.

1544
01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:08.579
[Lexi gasps]

1545
01:10:08.579 --> 01:10:10.415
This is beautiful.

1546
01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:12.500
But what's it for?

1547
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.877
I thought you should have a
professional looking briefcase

1548
01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.879
if you're gonna keep
spending time on set.

1549
01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:20.299
What about dad's gift?

1550
01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:23.136
Oh.

1551
01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.933
[chiming]

1552
01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:32.145
Chateau Seine.

1553
01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:37.191
Why don't we go
into the family room

1554
01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:38.818
and leave your parents

1555
01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:41.112
to have a little space together.
okay?

1556
01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:42.905
Let's go. You too. Larry.

1557
01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.198
No. no. over here.

1558
01:10:44.198 --> 01:10:45.450
-Oh. sorry.
-There we go.

1559
01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:47.034
Here we go.

1560
01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:48.661
Go. go. go. go.
Larry. wrong way. This way.

1561
01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:49.829
-[Larry] Sorry.
-[Grandma Millie] Here we go.

1562
01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:51.330
You'll have a key soon.

1563
01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:52.749
That's all right.
you'll figure it out.

1564
01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.917
[calm music]

1565
01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:01.674
And one more thing.

1566
01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.843
[John] Oh. boy.

1567
01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:10.099
I love this.

1568
01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:12.018
[Andrea] Me too.

1569
01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:16.314
It seems like a long time ago.

1570
01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:20.735
Yeah. and sometimes
it feels like just yesterday.

1571
01:11:20.735 --> 01:11:23.529
I was a widow
with a young daughter.

1572
01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:25.990
I didn't know if I'd
be able to find anyone

1573
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:28.659
to share the insanity with me.

1574
01:11:28.659 --> 01:11:30.286
I must have been the same myself

1575
01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:33.706
because I couldn't wait
to share it with you.

1576
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:39.921
Marrying you was the best thing
that could have happened to me.

1577
01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:41.881
Look. Andrea.

1578
01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:44.425
I was thinking we're in
a pretty good position

1579
01:11:44.425 --> 01:11:47.553
with my Christmas
bonus financially.

1580
01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:50.056
What do you think about us
taking a few days

1581
01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:53.142
and going somewhere warm
like you've been talking about?

1582
01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:56.896
Look. I didn't wanna do
this on Christmas.

1583
01:11:56.896 --> 01:11:58.606
I was gonna talk to you
about it tomorrow.

1584
01:11:58.606 --> 01:12:02.485
bu I don't think it can wait.

1585
01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:09.617
Things haven't been working
between us.

1586
01:12:09.617 --> 01:12:11.786
I know we've hit a rough patch.
John.

1587
01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:13.538
but we'll get through this.

1588
01:12:13.538 --> 01:12:15.164
-We always do.
-Yeah. I know.

1589
01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:17.583
We always did. Andrea. but...

1590
01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:24.173
I don't know
how to be married

1591
01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:26.133
to someone who's not here.

1592
01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:27.677
I know I haven't been here
as much.

1593
01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:30.805
No. it's not just that.
Andrea. it's...

1594
01:12:30.805 --> 01:12:35.142
even. even when you're here.
you're not here.

1595
01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:36.644
John. I love you.

1596
01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:40.690
I love you too. I just...

1597
01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:44.694
I don't wanna wake up
resenting you. or resenting us.

1598
01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.529
Don't I get a say in this?

1599
01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:47.989
You had a say in this

1600
01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:51.367
when you chose work
over your family.

1601
01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.953
I didn't choose work
over my family.

1602
01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:56.372
I chose work for my family.

1603
01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:01.836
I think we need some space
and time apart.

1604
01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:03.713
It's what's best for us.

1605
01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:07.008
Please. John. you're.
you're my best friend.

1606
01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:09.635
I wanna fix this.

1607
01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:11.178
We can tell 'em tomorrow.

1608
01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:14.473
For now let's. uh...

1609
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.769
let's go celebrate Christmas.

1610
01:13:18.769 --> 01:13:22.440
[pensive music]

1611
01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:31.991
[calm music]

1612
01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:34.577
[fire crackling]

1613
01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:41.834
Knock. knock.

1614
01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.547
How'd it go with Larry?

1615
01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:50.968
Well. I made him promise
to call me tomorrow.

1616
01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:54.430
And I thought maybe
you could use some of this.

1617
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.640
He told you.

1618
01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:58.851
He did.

1619
01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:03.022
And what did you say?

1620
01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:08.110
I said. it's gonna be
hard on everyone.

1621
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:10.488
especially the kids.

1622
01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:11.697
What did he say?

1623
01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:15.785
He said it's already hard.

1624
01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.374
What am I supposed to do?

1625
01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.417
Promotions are in January.

1626
01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:26.796
If I walk away now.

1627
01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:31.258
I'll. I'll just lose everything
that I've worked for.

1628
01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:34.303
What will you lose
if you don't walk away?

1629
01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:40.226
I love John
with my whole heart...

1630
01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:44.438
and I know you do too.

1631
01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:49.986
[Grandma Millie] It might be
time to let that be enough

1632
01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:54.699
and just trust that as long
as you have him and the kids.

1633
01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:58.411
that's all you need.

1634
01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.874
I'm just so close.

1635
01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:07.169
I. I can fix this.
I can convince John.

1636
01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:10.131
I just need one more shot.

1637
01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:14.844
So you think taking on
more work is the answer.

1638
01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:16.512
I'm sorry. Millie.

1639
01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:17.972
I have to get to sleep.

1640
01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:19.598
I can fix this.

1641
01:15:19.598 --> 01:15:21.726
I just need one more do over.

1642
01:15:28.649 --> 01:15:30.693
[Andrea] One more. Andrea.

1643
01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:34.613
One more do over and you'll
get everything you wished for.

1644
01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:37.116
[enchanting music]

1645
01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:51.672
[calm music]

1646
01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:06.270
No.

1647
01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:09.940
No. no. no. no. no.

1648
01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:18.699
John. where are the kids?

1649
01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:20.409
Matt's still in bed

1650
01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:22.119
and Lexi went over to
Madison's this morning. why?

1651
01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:24.163
John. what day is today?

1652
01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:27.792
Yesterday was Christmas.
so December 26th.

1653
01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:30.544
Listen. I was thinking
we could tell the kids

1654
01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:32.505
before you head back to Boston.

1655
01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:34.882
I think we owe it to them
to tell 'em together.

1656
01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:37.051
This isn't what I wanted.

1657
01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:38.844
This isn't my wish.

1658
01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:41.388
[dramatic music]

1659

[car squeaking to a stop]

1660
01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:51.607
Santa?

1661
01:16:53.067 --> 01:16:54.068
Santa?

1662
01:16:56.237 --> 01:16:57.947
I know you can hear me.

1663
01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:02.118
Where are you?

1664
01:17:05.746 --> 01:17:08.624
Ooh. hello. Andrea.

1665
01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:09.959
What are you doing?

1666
01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:11.877
Well. I'm enjoying a day off.

1667
01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:13.963
This is a busy time of the year.
you know.

1668
01:17:14.922 --> 01:17:16.048
What gives?

1669
01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.800
What gives what to whom?

1670
01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.593
Don't get clever.

1671
01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:22.429
I'm about to lose my family.
that's not what I wanted.

1672
01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:24.265
Are you sure?

1673
01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:25.933
Am I sure?

1674
01:17:25.933 --> 01:17:30.271
Of course I'm sure.
they mean everything to me.

1675
01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:33.399
You know. Andrea.
I've been around a while

1676
01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:36.360
and every year kids from
all over the world come to me

1677
01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.654
and tell me what they want
for Christmas.

1678
01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:40.990
Oh. children are
marvelously straightforward.

1679
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:42.950
They know what they want.

1680
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:46.245
And whether that's a doll
or a new baby brother.

1681
01:17:46.245 --> 01:17:50.166
or a live T-Rex.
they'll tell you.

1682
01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:55.129
Grownups. well.
grownups are more complex.

1683
01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:56.839
They say they want one thing.

1684
01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:59.842
but when it comes down to it.
they choose another.

1685
01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:02.303
I was just trying
to take care of my family.

1686
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:06.765
This is a huge misunderstanding.

1687
01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:09.685
Please. I just need
one more day.

1688
01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:13.606
Your wish is complete.
it came true.

1689
01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:15.858
I'm afraid
I can't change it now.

1690
01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.318
It's not enough.

1691
01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:23.490
John. he's my everything.

1692
01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:26.785
A wish isn't going
to bring him back. Andrea.

1693
01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:31.707
A wish can't do what you
won't do for yourself.

1694
01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:34.835
[phone ringing]

1695
01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:36.045
[magical twinkling]

1696
01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.344
Now's not a good time.

1697
01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:44.428
[Nick] Oh. not a good time?

1698
01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:46.388
Andrea. now is an amazing time.

1699
01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:48.307
The clients saw
the dailies from yesterday.

1700
01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:49.975
they are over the moon.

1701
01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:51.477
They wanna commission
a full campaign

1702
01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:53.187
with influencers
from all walks of life.

1703
01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:55.481
Like gardening. dancing.
fitness.

1704
01:18:55.481 --> 01:18:58.108
basically anywhere you can get
dirty. which is everywhere.

1705
01:18:58.108 --> 01:19:01.111
The best part is they want you
to spearhead the campaign.

1706
01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:03.030
We're talking a raise.
a promotion.

1707
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.574
-I mean. isn't this great?
-Yeah. great.

1708
01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:06.825
We need to meet
with the clients.

1709
01:19:06.825 --> 01:19:08.327
and come up with some ideas.

1710
01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:10.204
So could you put some
visuals together tonight?

1711
01:19:10.204 --> 01:19:12.039
'Cause we need to meet with them
first thing in the morning.

1712
01:19:12.039 --> 01:19:13.666
Oh. and I can't even wait
to tell you

1713
01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:15.251
about what happened
with my in-laws yesterday.

1714
01:19:17.002 --> 01:19:18.003
Hello?

1715
01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:22.049
Andrea. this is... Hello?

1716
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:31.058
I'll be at Jill's
if you need me.

1717
01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.186
Okay.

1718
01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:37.815
John. I'm sorry.

1719
01:19:37.815 --> 01:19:41.235
You don't have to
apologize anymore. just.

1720
01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:42.528
I'll tell the kids tonight

1721
01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:46.740
and you can call 'em after work.

1722
01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:51.287
And. hey. congratulations again
on the promotion.

1723

[car engine revving]

[siren wailing]

1728
01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:03.067
So this I get to do over.

1729
01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:12.785
It's starting to become
a regular thing.

1730
01:21:12.785 --> 01:21:14.244
You have no idea.

1731
01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:18.457
Do you know why
I pulled you over?

1732
01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:20.250
I made an illegal turn.

1733
01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:23.212
But do you know why
I made an illegal turn?

1734
01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:24.213
Um...

1735
01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:29.343
Matt. he's a great kid.

1736
01:21:29.343 --> 01:21:31.553
He has the biggest heart
of anyone I know.

1737
01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:34.181
but a bigger heart
is easier to break.

1738
01:21:34.181 --> 01:21:36.934
I mean. he needs someone
there to pick him up

1739
01:21:36.934 --> 01:21:39.520
and remind him
what a great kid he is.

1740
01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:42.606
And Lexi. who you met yesterday.

1741
01:21:42.606 --> 01:21:45.359
She is whip smart. fearless.

1742
01:21:45.359 --> 01:21:47.194
or at least she likes
to pretend she is.

1743
01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:49.446
She still doesn't fully
trust herself.

1744
01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:52.449
She needs somebody there
to remind her

1745
01:21:52.449 --> 01:21:55.369
that she can do anything
she puts her mind to.

1746
01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:59.331
And John. my better half.
my everything.

1747
01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:02.376
A man I love more
than life itself.

1748
01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:05.045
and I'm gonna lose all of them.

1749
01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:08.424
I'm gonna lose everything
unless I get back home.

1750
01:22:08.424 --> 01:22:11.593
Wow. that was.
that was beautiful.

1751
01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:16.598
Although I did let you off
with a warning yesterday.

1752
01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:20.811
so I'm gonna write you a ticket.

1753
01:22:20.811 --> 01:22:23.355
License and registration.
please.

1754
01:22:35.868 --> 01:22:38.328
Andrea. I thought you were--

1755
01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:39.621
Have you?

1756
01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:40.622
No.

1757
01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:43.709
Now that you're home.
though. um.

1758
01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:47.171
your mom and I have
something to tell you.

1759
01:22:48.172 --> 01:22:50.007
[Lexi sighs]

1760
01:22:50.007 --> 01:22:52.050
-[John] Your mom and I. uh...
-Can I?

1761
01:22:53.177 --> 01:22:54.219
Yeah.

1762
01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.018
Kids. what your dad and I
have to tell you

1763
01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:02.311
is that. uh...

1764
01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:05.105
I messed up.

1765
01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:10.944
I messed up over and over.

1766
01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:17.284
every basketball game. or joke.
or funny video I missed.

1767
01:23:17.284 --> 01:23:20.704
Every moment I wasn't here
to cheer you on

1768
01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:23.165
or cheer you up.

1769
01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:26.126
Every time I paid more attention
to things going on at work

1770
01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:29.588
than to things going on
in my own home. I messed up.

1771
01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:35.093
I love you more than anything.

1772
01:23:35.093 --> 01:23:37.763
but I guess I got so caught up
in providing for you

1773
01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:41.225
that I. I lost sight
of being there for you.

1774
01:23:43.143 --> 01:23:44.186
For all of you.

1775
01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:45.938
[John] Andrea--

1776
01:23:45.938 --> 01:23:48.315
John. you have supported me
since the moment we met.

1777
01:23:48.315 --> 01:23:51.151
You have helped me
chase my dreams.

1778
01:23:51.151 --> 01:23:53.779
even when I chased them too far.

1779
01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:55.864
And not because you had to.

1780
01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:58.617
but because it's just
who you are.

1781
01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:02.204
And I guess I just
got used to that

1782
01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:05.082
and I took it for granted.

1783
01:24:05.082 --> 01:24:07.292
I didn't realize
that I could lose it.

1784
01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:09.503
Andrea. I really don't think--

1785
01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:12.589
But this Christmas I realized

1786
01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:17.386
that my dreams
are here with you.

1787
01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:19.846
And without you
I don't have any dreams.

1788
01:24:19.846 --> 01:24:21.557
I don't have anything.

1789
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:26.937
Look. I don't care
if we go broke.

1790
01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:29.690
I don't care if we have
to sell the house.

1791
01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:32.859
I don't care if we have
to eat ramen for every meal.

1792
01:24:32.859 --> 01:24:36.446
I don't care if I have
to trade in my car for a bike.

1793
01:24:36.446 --> 01:24:38.323
I don't care about any of it.

1794
01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:42.327
I will let everything else go

1795
01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:45.664
if there's even a chance
that I can hold onto you.

1796
01:24:45.664 --> 01:24:47.416
Andrea.

1797
01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:49.334
Don't make any decisions now.

1798
01:24:50.377 --> 01:24:53.046
but I'm not moving out.

1799
01:24:53.046 --> 01:24:56.383
If I have to sleep in a tent
in the backyard. I will...

1800
01:24:59.052 --> 01:25:01.346
just as long as you're there
when I wake up.

1801
01:25:03.307 --> 01:25:05.809
Please don't make any decisions
that you can't take back.

1802
01:25:05.809 --> 01:25:08.228
I've made enough of those
for the both of us.

1803
01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:11.690
Andrea. I can't have
you sleeping in a tent

1804
01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:13.025
in our backyard.

1805
01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:15.611
Because...

1806
01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:21.074
as long as I wake up
with you beside me.

1807
01:25:22.326 --> 01:25:23.952
I'll be forever complete.

1808
01:25:25.245 --> 01:25:26.788
[John] Welcome home.

1809
01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:29.166
Welcome home.

1810
01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:31.251
-[enchanting music]
-[Andrea sniffling]

1811
01:25:31.251 --> 01:25:34.963
[phone ringing]

1812
01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:36.632
Just trust me.

1813
01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:41.970
Hello?

1814
01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.889
Hey. where are you?
You on your way?

1815
01:25:43.889 --> 01:25:45.557
[Andrea] I'm not coming in.

1816
01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:46.767
Not coming?

1817
01:25:46.767 --> 01:25:48.727
Did I not make myself clear?

1818
01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:51.313
[Andrea] Nick. you've always
made yourself very clear.

1819
01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:53.649
That's one of your few
good qualities.

1820
01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:56.652
But it's time for me
to make myself clear.

1821
01:25:56.652 --> 01:25:58.695
I am not coming into the office.

1822
01:25:58.695 --> 01:26:00.280
Okay. but the client--

1823
01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.699
Specifically requested me
for this campaign. right?

1824
01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:04.660
So tell them
that I am not available

1825
01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:08.372
until after Christmas break.
an extended Christmas break.

1826
01:26:08.372 --> 01:26:09.831
What if they say no?

1827
01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.625
I don't care if they say no.

1828
01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:13.543
But. Andrea.

1829
01:26:13.543 --> 01:26:16.129
I am not available to work
with them until next month.

1830
01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:17.714
I'm taking my family

1831
01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:22.552
on a well deserved vacation.
somewhere warm.

1832
01:26:22.552 --> 01:26:25.472
It's been far too long since
we acted like a family.

1833
01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:27.057
Andrea. you can't do this.

1834
01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:28.475
I just did.

1835
01:26:28.475 --> 01:26:29.476
[Nick] Andrea?

1836
01:26:33.397 --> 01:26:36.566
I am really starting
to like her.

1837
01:26:36.566 --> 01:26:38.735
That's my girl!

1838
01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:43.657
Bravo!

1839
01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:46.076
[all laughing]

1840
01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:49.246
[Matt] That's what
I'm talking about.

1841
01:26:49.246 --> 01:26:50.372
-[John] Did you hear that?
-[Matt] Merry Christmas!

1842
01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:52.207
[Grandma Millie] That was great!

1843
01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:54.042
[Lexi] So. where are we going
on vacation?

1844
01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:01.550
[bright upbeat music]

1845
01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:18.233
[bright upbeat music continues]

1846
