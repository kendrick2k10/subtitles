We can use
our spirits.

443
00:31:16.445 --> 00:31:19.413
the energy from our spirits
sometimes levitate small objects

444
00:31:19.448 --> 00:31:21.547
without even
using our muscles.

445
00:31:21.582 --> 00:31:24.583
but we can't really
generate a lot of force from it.

446
00:31:24.618 --> 00:31:26.387
